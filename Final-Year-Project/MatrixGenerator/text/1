in the first wave of the internet  there was aol and other companies laying the foundation for people to connect  in the second wave  google and facebook dominated with search and social capabilities  and now  the third wave is here  a wave that will be shaped by entrepreneurs who are set on disrupting entrenched industries  a wave where entrepreneurs outside of silicon valley will thrive  a wave that will be driven by collaboration between entrepreneurs and elected officials  programmers and policymakers and as i stated in my book     if you want to go far in the third wave  you must go together     in that same spirit  i want to collaborate with you before the paperback version of the third wave comes out next spring  i want to hear from you  i want to see what new information has surfaced and what insights could be beneficial to third wave riders  that is why i am posting    america disrupted     a chapter from my book  here on medium even if you haven   t read the third wave in its entirety  give the chapter a read  and let me know what you think by commenting below i will be reading all of your responses and highlighting my favorites through my social media channels  if your edit is picked for inclusion in the book  your name will be listed in the afterword of the paperback edition one of the pioneers of the early motion picture industry was a producer named irving thalberg  thalberg produced films for mgm  hundreds of them  and he had a reputation for being an obsessive workaholic  he   d overbook his schedule  miss meetings  make important people wait for hours for an appointment  he became nearly impossible to get hold of  creating bottlenecks in his productions and frustrations among his colleagues  as legend goes  the marx brothers once arrived for a meeting  only to hear that thalberg would be thirty minutes late  frustrated  they lit two cigars each and began blowing smoke under thalberg   s door    is there a fire      thalberg exclaimed  bursting from his office    no     said groucho     there   s the marx brothers    too often these days  it seems as though the only way entrepreneurs can get the government to pay attention to them is to follow groucho   s strategy  blow smoke    blow a lot of smoke     and hope someone thinks it   s fire for our purposes here  however  i   m not interested in blowing smoke  i   ve made it clear that i think that government has an essential role to play in third wave entrepreneurship  and that i have little patience for people who are dismissive of that role  but i am not naive  i understand that  as important as it is for entrepreneurs to take government seriously  it   s even more important for government to take entrepreneurs seriously due to the magnitude of the third wave  we know that the benefits for american consumers can be profound  but what we don   t yet know is which economy will accrue the benefits that come from third wave entrepreneurship  it is true  of course  that the united states has spent the better part of the century in a global leadership position  but increasingly  our incumbency has led to complacency  during the third wave  it may well be america that is disrupted this may sound overblown  but it wouldn   t be the first time other countries challenged american dominance  there have been numerous occasions in our history when a great industry  born in the united states  ended up relocated elsewhere  in       none of the top five automakers were american companies  and not a single american company manufactured television screens in the united states  these are industries that were born in america  we have a way  it seems  of ceding opportunities rather than seizing them  if the same holds true during the third wave  the most significant economic transformation of the next two decades could be the great achievement of others what can the united states do to prevent that future  how can we ensure that third wave companies choose to start here  to put down roots here  and find success here  i believe there are six areas where the government should concentrate stop confusing startups and small busiespecially where policy is concerned  there is a meaningful difference between startups and small businesses  both are critical to the u s  economy  but founders who hope to build a    startup       are looking to do something fundamentally different than those looking to start a small business  in general     startup    is a term reserved for companies that can scale quickly and that can disrupt an existing category  startups are generally backed by venture investors who see the potential for ten or even one hundred times the return on investment  small businesses  on the other hand  are generally funded with debt financing a small business loan from a local bank  for example and their aim is to grow steadily over time  they aspire to have a steady number of employees  customers  and revenues over a long period  the difference between the two is reflected both in the kinds of problems they are trying to solve and in their effect on the broader economy  indeed  it is not small businesses but new business startups that account for nearly all of the net new job creation in the united states  the top performing i percent of startups often referred to as gazelles are responsible for roughly    percent of new job creation each year the following chart helps illustrate the importance of start   ups to job creation startups create most new net jobs in the united stwhen you hear most politicians talking about job creation  they tend to lump small businesses and startups together and to pursue policies that help the former more than they do the latter  it should be the opposite  if politicians want to spur job creation  their focus should be on making it easier for new startups to succeed get in front of the third wavin       journalist darren samuelsohn wrote an article for politico     what washington really knows about the internet of things     in which he set out to determine    how well government was keeping up    with an industry that he predicted could end up being as much as    percent of the global economy    what i found  overall     samuelsohn wrote is that the government doesn   t have any single mechanism to address the internet of things or the challenges it   s presenting  instead  the new networked object technologies are covered by at least two dozen separate federal agencies from the food and drug administration to the national highway traffic safety administration  from aviation to agriculture and more than    different congressional committees  congress has written no laws or any kind of overarching national strategy specifically for the internet of things samuelsohn   s reporting is both worrying and unsurprising  because of the size and bureaucratic nature of government  political leaders tend to act more like the fire department than the police force  rather than patrolling for problems  they wait until something is burning but even once policymakers focus on it  the effort won   t be easy  because third wave entrepreneurship will touch so many distinct industries across every sector of the economy  the jurisdiction problems alone are overwhelming  the federal government isn   t designed to regulate issues that affect so many different sectors at once  and when it tries  the result is often a patchwork of inconsistent  even contradictory  rules and a maze of confusion for the businesses trying to follow the rules one option would be to reduce the size of the cabinet  which now includes twenty two people  all reporting to the president  i don   t know of any ceo in america with so many direct reports  government and business are not the same thing not by any stretch but this is one lesson from business that government should embrace  in       president nixon proposed reducing the cabinet to just seven departments  consolidating agencies and providing more authority to the officials who run them  unlike other cabinet reduction proposals  the goal here would not be to reduce the size of the federal government  rather  it would be to reduce the inefficiency that comes with its size  there would be fewer cabinet officials  yes  but they would be meaningfully more powerful  the vice president might even act as a coo would  running a coordination effort across government and freeing up the president to be more strategic  much like a ceo at the same time  we should reform the senate confirmation and vetting process  which is so long and so overreaching that it discourages some of the country   s most talented people from serving  even when called upon by their president of course  in washington  something this sensible would likely be considered radical  it is not something that can be accomplished overnight  and in the meantime  businesses will keep bumping up against a deeply inefficient government  slowing the pace of innovation and allowing competitors to catch up  as a stopgap measure  we might at least consider a temporary fix  toward the end of       an outbreak of ebola in africa snowballed from an isolated incident to a growing epidemic of potentially global proportions  the american public began to panic when  for the first time  ebola made its way to the united states  infecting people who had traveled to west africa and the medical staff who cared for them  congress called for immediate action  president obama recognized the growing discontent and grew increasingly concerned about the federal response  he knew the effort would have to be coordinated across several agencies  that   s when my friend and colleague ron klain got a phone call ron oversees our investment activities at revolution and also helps provide guidance and support to the case foundation  he has served in many government roles  including as chief of staff to vice presidents al gore and joe biden  ron is known for his intelligence  management skills  and problem solving ability  and for his steady hand  that   s why president obama thought that he would be the perfect choice to become the ebola czar  there were too many agencies working on different aspects of the crisis  and it meant that a lot of efforts weren   t being coordinated  the president needed a single person reporting to him  someone to whom all of the different agencies reported  someone with the authority to work across every aspect of the federal government to clarify strategy and then execute it we need the exact same thing for the third wave  we can   not afford to have such an enormous economic opportunity get stifled by a government too slow and too fractured to respond in time  what we need is a single person within the executive branch with the authority to work across and above the myriad agencies  putting a dear strategy in place and managing the day to day execution of it across government  what we need  i believe  is a third wave czar i believe that this is only a temporary solution that the real need is to reboot and reorganize the executive branch  many presidents have tried  but congress has always blocked the changes  in part out of self interest  worried they might lose authority over an industry that supplies them with campaign contributions  more czars are a band aid  not a long term answer  in a rapidly changing world  only a government that is nimble and strategic can keep america on track invest more money in research and developthirty years from now  it   s unlikely that the country will view google  also known now as alphabet  as our most inspiring  path breaking  and big thinking company  the cachet that google now enjoys will belong to a newer  younger company  and  like google  this new company will have made its name off technology that  in its early stages  was developed with the help of the federal government   s investments in research and development assuming  of course  that we make those necessary investments that   s not an easy assumption to make  we should be mortified by how little we   ve been investing in possible breakthrough technologies  in       federal investments in r d amounted to      of a percentage point of gdp the lowest level it   s been at since the     s  and we   ve been cutting back r d steadily over the last twenty five years even as federally supported r d continues to prove its value  no wonder we now lag behind china and germany in high tech exports with singapore and south korea following closely behind   the lack of investment has crippled programs and institutions that have been among the most critical launch pads for innovation  the national institutes of health  for example  has a track record of success in the field of medical research  but in       the nih   s budget was    percent lower than it was a decade earlier  in the past  the nih could fund one out of every three research proposals they received  by       they could fund only one in six  the national science foundation  nasa  the centers for disease control and prevention  the department of defense  and the department of energy were among the most important government funded r d centers to see significant budget cuts   fifty four percent of scientists and researchers who receive some federal funding to conduct their work were forced to lay off staff  some began considering moving their work overseas  where more stable funding options exist in the field of biomedical research  federal investment has dropped every single year since        from      to       the u s  share in total biomedical research dropped   per   cent  while the asia pacific region   s investment levels rose    percent in the same period  the new jobs and companies are following the money  budget cuts may have been enacted out of concerns over deficits  but decreasing our investment in research and development guarantees future deficits  according to nobel prize   winning economist robert solow  we owe more than half of our gdp growth over the last fifty years to scientific breakthroughs  yet we   ve been reducing our ability to undertake cutting edge research that gives rise to disruptive technologies  in shrinking our commitments to research and development  we are decreasing our long term economic potential and squashing our ability to create tomorrow   s great innovations make it easier for startups to raise moneyevery single day  americans come up with great ideas they could conceivably turn into a business  but few of them go forward with it  one of the greatest difficulties of starting a business is finding capital  if you don   t have a network of contacts  it can be hard to get in front of investors  the hustle involved could turn people off from pursuing what could end up being a successful business  but it doesn   t have to be this way  in the age of the internet  connecting ideas and investors could be a much easier process and the federal government can facilitate it congress and the white house took a big step when they passed the jobs act  which  among other things  legalized equity based crowdfunding  before the jobs act  people could only invest in a startup if they were    accredited    by the sec   which requires either a net worth of more than    million or an income of at least           and if a company had more than     shareholders  it had to be registered with the sec these paternalistic rules had two negative effects on the economy  first  they have kept billions of investment dollars on the sideline  money that isn   t being used to create companies and jobs and the value that comes with them  second  by making it so that only the wealthy can invest in startups  the accredited investor system only exacerbates income inequality  the rich get richer  as only the accredited investors get the opportunity to invest in the startups that could become the next facebook this system was modified in an important way with the jobs act  but after its passage in april       the securities and exchange commission  which was in charge of writing the rules to implement the law  took more than three years to do so  the end product was a set of rules that are still burdensome  albeit less so  for young companies  they will certainly require fine tuning over time  i understand the need to take a careful approach to these rules  but these kinds of delays are the antithesis of the speed and nimbleness that startups require  once fine tuned  the sec rules will help  but they won   t  on their own  make capital accessible for any worthy startup  there are other approaches that can increase the flow of investments into startups that congress ought to explore  tax incentives   like reducing tax rates on capital gains earned from certain startup investments would drive dollars into young ventures at key stages  any conversation about tax reform  therefore  must include these considerations  long term investments that can create jobs and drive growth must be encouraged make it easier to hire top talmany consider immigration reform to be a    third rail    of american politics  touch it and you die  or  at least  your electoral future does   but in the entrepreneurial sector  there   s no such controversy  what there is instead is a recognition that we are in the middle of a global battle for talent there are many  many immigrants with good ideas  they come from asia and africa  europe and the middle east  ac   cording to a      kauffman foundation study  roughly one in four tech companies established between      and      had at least one foreign born founder  in silicon valley  nearly half did   as i noted when i testified in front of the senate judiciary committee advocating in favor of immigration re   form  those businesses accounted for     billion in revenues in      alone  elon musk  founder of tesla  emigrated from south africa to canada and then from canada to the united states  sergey brin  co founder of google  fled the soviet union with his family and came to the united states as a six year old  as the new york times put it     were it not for the hebrew immigrant aid society  there might be no google     yet even as more and more immigrants flock to the united states  the uncertainty and insecurity generated by outdated and inadequate immigration laws have hobbled our ability to compete for the best talent  the percentage of companies founded by immigrants has declined more than    percent since        and just about any startup founder can tell you what a nightmare it is to obtain a green card for a prized employee  talented scientists and engineers are still coming to american universities to study but all too often they are then returning home with their entrepreneurial ideas  even when they would have preferred to stay it   s not that foreigners aren   t founding companies anymore  rather  they   re being turned away from the united states  making it more likely that they   ll try starting a business elsewhere  either at home or in a more hospitable country  snapdeal was co founded by a wharton graduate  kunal bahl  but he was forced to relocate when he couldn   t get a visa to stay in the united states  by       snapdeal was worth    billion and employed more than       people in india those jobs  and that economic growth  could have stayed in the united states if we had a more flexible immigration system  it makes no sense for us to invite students to come to the united states  train them to create economic value  and then kick them out america has been the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation in part because we   ve been an immigrant friendly nation  as we   ve made it harder to come here and stay here  we   ve lost talent to other countries most of the immigration debate within the tech industry has focused on reforming the h  b visa program  which provides a temporary stay for foreign workers employed in specialized fields  the pool of h  b visa holders is often a great source of employees for tech companies  but only        h  b visas are awarded annually  with        reserved for applicants with master   s degrees  while demand is much higher us  citizenship and immigration services received more than         petitions in         increasing the number of immigrant entrepreneurs and engineers who can acquire an h  b visa would be a boon to american businesses yet  as james surowiecki wrote in the new yorker in august          in       the number of employment based permanent visas was capped at a hundred and forty thousand a year  astonishingly  that number hasn   t changed since  even though the u s  economy is now sixty six per cent bigger  and  with the rise of india and china  the supply of global talent has grown sharply      we need to create a startup visa program  one that opens the door for immigrant entrepreneurs with a proven idea to launch their startups in the united states and  should they find success and want to stay here  gives them a route to citizenship  reforming the h  b visa system is important to the big tech companies  but the startup visa is more con   sequential  we   ve long talked about stapling a green card to graduate school diplomas now it   s time to pass legislation to do it the united states can remain the most innovative and entrepreneurial nation  but only if we are a magnet for the world   s best and brightest  immigration is not just a problem to solve  it   s an opportunity to seize write some new rules for a new erawhat we saw in the first and  to some extent  the second wave of the internet we are seeing once again in the third  the economy changes far faster than the rules governing it  the system we have in place to regulate business is stuck on twentieth century notions of how the american economy works some of which no longer makes sense companies such as uber and instacart  an on demand grocery delivery service   which rely on individuals who work on a project to project basis  are leading us to rethink ideas about employment and what it means to be a worker  these companies give people the flexibility to work their own hours as they see fit  and the compensation to make a good income for those hours  but this new approach is not without some problems for example  some workers are concerned that they don   t have protections against losing their contractor status for undue cause  specifically  as the    uberization    of more and more industries takes hold  how will the middle class earn paid sick leave  vacation days  and unemployment insurance and contribute to their retirement plans a primary reason why these issues are emerging is that our legal system   s view of employment wasn   t designed for the freelance economy  rather  it was written into new deal legislation  which divided workers into two categories  full employees and independent contractors  that worked for decades  but it doesn   t work anymore  a large part of the labor force of these startups is now composed of people who work only a few hours a week there is a happy medium that can exist between full employment status  which usually confers benefits and stability to employees  and contractor status  which provides flexibility and mobility  preserving the rights of workers and enabling economic growth do not have to be mutually exclusive aims but they will be if we stick to old definitions of employment  as senator mark warner put it in the washington post     instead of trying to make the new economy look more like the old  washington should encourage these innovations and work to create more opportunities and upward economic mobility for everybody     it   s up to the government to take an active role in establishing a fair compromise that allows us to do just that  there   s a tremendous upside in getting this right not just for the companies in question but for middle  and low income workers  if the government creates a new employment designation that both allows for this sort of on demand work structure and provides basic worker protections  it could open a new path to socioeconomic mobility that   s not to say that climbing the socioeconomic ladder will become easy  but it   s not as if the people who will be in a position to benefit from the freelance economy have it easy now  undereducated workers today have few options to move up  by and large  it   s difficult for such workers to find the time or resources to dedicate to furthering their education  the people who manage to do so while working low wage jobs are practically superhuman  but that shouldn   t be the requirement for living a good life in america other countries don   t have the same preoccupations we do  they   ve watched america grow and prosper and have studied our methods  and now they are working to do the same for themselves  all around the world  nations are working to replicate the conditions necessary for a vibrant entrepreneurial environment  they   re encouraging entrepreneurship  making it easier to start and run businesses  increasing access to capital  and creating the support networks needed to better position their citizen entrepreneurs and those they can attract to their shores for success in       canada launched its start up visa program  offering permanent residence to entrepreneurs willing to move to canada and start a business or relocate their current one  as employment minister jason kenney put it     we   re seeking very deliberately to benefit from the dysfunctional american immigration system  i make no bones about it       in chile  the government launched a flagship seed accelerator program called start up chile in       the goal was to create chile   s own    mini silicon valley     which could provide a boost to an economy that was already one of latin america   s fastest growing  europe  too  is waking up and embracing the entrepreneurship imperative  cities such as london  helsinki  stockholm  and berlin are becoming thriving startup com   munities  london leapfrogged san francisco and new york as the world   s top city for crowdfunding in       and the british government is trying to modify their regulatory environment to position the uk as the fintech capital of the world south korea  meanwhile  is working to rid the stigma associated with failure a fear that every entrepreneurial nation must conquer through investing      billion in startups  and china wants to grow its skilled worker pool to over     million by the end of the decade    in doing so  they hope to reverse the trend in which chinese citizens leave the country to study at premier universities and end up contributing to other economies including ours we also see emerging startup sectors in the middle east and africa creating a more stable world and new competitors  all at once  israel is widely praised as a preeminent    startup nation       and is making huge investments in basic technology we   ve seen the creation of venture capital funds in the west bank to fund entrepreneurs who can create jobs  opportunity  and hope in the region   i   m proud to note that the case foundation was a catalyst for the creation of one such fund when my wife  jean  co chaired the u s  palestinian partnership for president george w  bush  africa is on the move  with nigeria and kenya in particular emerging as hotbeds of entrepreneurial innovation  and we   re even seeing an entrepreneurial culture break out in cuba  after a half century of being held back by socialism  cubans are preparing for an innovation revolution  small businesses  long banned  are now permitted  and some of those small businesses may  over time  become big businesses these regions and nations are moving forward at a time when america is trending sideways in certain areas and moving backward in others  and the tools that have long been available to entrepreneurs in america are increasingly available to entrepreneurs all over the world it seems everywhere you look in the world from australia   to zambia   governments are working with the private sector to optimize a startup friendly environment  admittedly  these are not imminent threats  lagos isn   t going to leapfrog silicon valley in the next six months  or even the next six years  nor is santiago  sao paulo  or seoul  but that doesn   t mean we should be content with where we stand today  and it certainly doesn   t mean that we shouldn   t seek to be better  losing our entrepreneurial edge is not just about how we are doing in comparison to other countries  it   s how we are doing in comparison to our own potential the american economy is an entrepreneurial ecosystem  to get growth  we need to support growth  we need new ideas coming out of r d labs  which entrepreneurs can then adapt for commercialization  knowing they have the runway they need to scale and succeed  and then we need to do it all over again  that   s what will create the jobs and the economic activity that will maintain our position on the point of the spear  but if any of those groups fails to make a contribution  the system breaks down  already  the government   s failure to support our entrepreneurial community properly is costing us countless jobs and economic growth america led in the first wave  and again in the second wave  we can and should lead in the third wave  if we take the right actions and do it quickly  a bright future will be assured  if we fail to  the world will no longer look to us as a source of radical innovation  instead  we   ll end up playing catch up  attempting to emulate the creations of other nations rather than introducing the ideas that others try to copy it won   t mean the end of america  but likely it will mean the end of american leadership  and that   s a future we all must work to avoid people  if you got this far  please hit the     below  we   re a team right    http   www politico com agenda story
