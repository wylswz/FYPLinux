&^%A&SD it   s october          and i   m in my dorm room at american university pacing up and down the hallway  i didn   t know if i could do it  i didn   t know if i could really thru campus with this sign on my chest  a sign that read    i am undocumented    the reality is  deciding to come out as undocumented isn   t exactly a choice you hope to make  but rather a choice you have to make just three years before that moment in the hallway  i didn   t even know i was undocumented  i had moved to the u s  at the age of six with my mom  i remember the day we landed because i was so excited to see my sister  ana  who had been living here  that when my mom and i were stopped by immigration i couldn   t even focus on the officer   s questions every time he asked me  while pointing at my mom     is this your mom     i just responded by asking for my sister  of course  at the age of six i didn   t realize just how serious all of this really was outside of pre k and kindergarten  all of my schooling has been here in the u s  as you can imagine  i grew up feeling just as american as any other kid around me  i went to school  played with my friends after school  and just tried to discover who i really wanted to be however  this would all change for me in      during my senior year of high school  when my mom would sit me down to tell me i was undocumented  i could see in her eyes the fear and the pain she felt  she had moved to the united states to build our american dream  and here she was having to tell her kid that the country we loved didn   t consider me american enough to be allowed to even go to college i know a lot of people think it   s messed up that she didn   t tell me until then  and to be honest i did too  it wasn   t until i was making the decision to come out publicly that i really came to understand all of the fear that drove these decisions  a fear that families are faced with every single day in this country  a fear of being deported and having your family torn apart by a system that is clearly flawed my mom   s fear was so great that i even remember times we would go to the mall and if we saw a security officer with a badge she would grab my hand and pull me closer towards her  she of course didn   t realize at the time that a mall cop had no real authority to get us deported  it was this fear that held my mom back from telling me was undocumented before my senior year  and it was that same fear that held me back from coming out in      crazily enough  i had already experienced what it felt to live in fear about revealing another aspect of my identity  i had grown up knowing i was gay since the moment i liked my best friend in first grade  but i knew i couldn   t say anything  i honestly thought i was just going to have to hold it in for all of my life because toxic masculinity in my community was enough to keep me silent  eventually  i realized i had the strength to confront that toxic culture  and now it   s been ten years since i came out as gay i   m about to celebrate another personal milestone  october          will mark five years of being out as undocumented  there are definitely parallels between my two coming out experiences  but i know that what really drove me to come out as undocumented was a desire to speak out and speak up for years i had seen the dreamer movement build up around the country  i had seen undocumented immigrants walk from miami to dc  i had seen protests with undocumented immigrants who shouted at the top of their lungs    undocumented and unafraid     and i envied them  i envied them for their bravery but i allowed this envy to culminate into action  for me   beyondthewall  means taking my mom   s sacrifices of moving us to this country and using it as the drive to push against the norm of what i could do with my life as an undocumented immigrant  although i definitely experienced what it was like to be pushed out of opportunities because of my status  i still recognize the amazing privileges i held  not only did i get to attend school at seminole state college of florida and american university  but i also received the jack kent cooke undergraduate transfer scholarship  one of the very few scholarships in the nation that allows for undocumented applicants  it was my personal mission to push the envelope and show my mom that her sacrifices wouldn   t be in vain  and this is what drove me to become the first undocumented intern at the clinton foundation in      the reality is  we all have to make a choice  and every single day undocumented immigrants around this country make the choice to be brave that is why i see so much of the beauty that lies  beyondthewall  i see the stories that continue to drive this country and i see the human lives that exist beyond the metaphor of a wall that keeps everyone out as this country continues to grow  it is imperative that we accept the amazing contributions of undocumented immigrants in this country  that we come to understand that behind each of us there is a story  that this country should not be tearing families apart but instead bringing families together as a gay  formerly undocumented immigrant in this country i have seen the power of community  i have seen how those in the lgbtq  community and those in the immigrant community have held each other together  we cannot allow for fear to be the driving narrative in this country  five years ago  i let go of that fear and walked out on campus with the sign that read    i am undocumented    and now i am dedicating my life to tell the stories of our communities around the nation i am an immigrant  we are immigrants  we are human to see more stories  go to beyondthewall org  then share your own story using
