there has been some speculation in the tech startup space regarding this    big chinese fund    and i finally posted this tweet yesterday i want to share the origin story of how this intention to raise a      million dollars vc fund came about  to set the record straight this year         over     people have asked me    hey rayn  why are you not running a proper vc fund yet      feeling frustrated  i started cold calling chinese family offices and pitched my fund to them initially  my strategy was to raise around      million dollars to invest in promising aussie startups    series g round of financing  the  th round if you include the seed round   why  because   is the lucky number  lafite slapped a red number   on their      vintage and that shit sold like hot cakes in china however  after some market research  i found that a big portion of australian tech companies like to prematurely backdoor list on the asx after   rounds of funding at like     million dollars market capitalisation  so this strategy obviously will not work for my proposed fund  because i initially intended to write     million dollars cheque for each investment  that was a big  facepalm moment for me and i could not eat nor sleep for a few weeks i then pivoted to my bread and butter early stage rounds  simple mathematics shows that i will need to do a     k seed round every week  and a   m follow on series a round every month  and a   m series b round every quarter  then i can fully deploy the fund in around   years time  don   t worry if the numbers don   t add up  i am pitching to chinese family offices  not you  that proposed deployment strategy was so brilliant  the potential investors started their due diligence process on me immediately  i think the following were what made my potential investors    ticked    i can   t disclose who my potential investors will be due to confidentiality  but i can share their surnames  in no particular order  wang  ma  li  ma      li      lei  zong  he  and a backup wang      just in case any of the previously mentioned family bails  i intend to raise this fund quickly  and do the first close when i have enough commitments from my potential investors  and do the second close when i have to i am now looking for a cto to help me build the website  damn  they are so hard to find and so hard to please this is the source of truth about my fund  everything else is false thank you for your support so far       plug  i know nothing about china but if you want to find out more about this mysterious country  you can come to this event at the newly launched haymarkethq co working space in chinatown i intend to ask curt and daniel some good questions and i think they intend to give you some good answers  but good intentions are just good intentions  no guarantee from anyone  ok and no  i will not talk about my fund that night party round investor  ex half stack developer  current startup tshirt collector
