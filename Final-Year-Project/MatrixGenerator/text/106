i   m fascinated by tech ecosystems  and the network effects behind them  i wrote about berlin  here  and about paris  here  but of course  as an nyc venture capitalist  i   m particularly interested in new york         i wrote about the strong nyc data community a while back  here   and about nyc as a great home for european entrepreneurs  here  the new york tech ecosystem is in an interesting place right now  the emergence of nyc was a big story at tech conferences and in the press maybe four or five years ago  fast forward to today  on the one hand  nyc has become the clear number   to the bay area  on the other hand  it   s hard not to notice that things have gone a bit quiet         at a minimum  we seem to be past the stage of unbridled enthusiasm the bull case is that new york is now firmly established as a startup hub  and therefore it is less press worthy than when it was first emerging  to wit  entrepreneurial activity and vc investment levels have never been higher  for context  with     b invested  q       saw almost  x more vc investment in nyc than q       the bear case is that  for all the progress  nyc still suffers from many of the same issues that have plagued it for years  a relative dearth of   bn  exits  a lack of local anchor companies that can serve as acquirers  and a comparatively lower concentration of talent  particularly when it comes to not just starting  but actually scaling  startups those are non trivial concerns  while they offer some protection  network effects can just as easily peter out as they can get stronger         an ecosystem is fundamentally a living and breathing organism my take  new york is in the process of catching up to the hype  that doesn   t make for splashy headlines  and takes a long time  but the reality of the nyc tech ecosystem coming of age is actually happening right now the slope of enlightenso where are we if there was a gartner hype cycle for emerging tech ecosystems  my sense is that new york would probably somewhere in the    slope of enlightenment    phase both the scale and the steepness of the slopes are not right  but this is probably directionally correct new york had a long ride to the    peak of inflated expectations     throughout the   s and the   s  new york went from having a handful of entrepreneurs and vc firms to something that felt more like a real community  then known as    silicon alley     but it probably wasn   t until   or   years ago that people started talking excitedly about new york as having the potential to be a major global tech ecosystem  there certainly was tons of momentum  with everything coming together nicely  it had a deep connective tissue of meetups  conferences and new incubators  it had a mayor  a tech founder himself  who truly got it  it had some vc firms like union square ventures with national appeal  and west coast firms were starting to actively invest in later rounds  and most importantly  it had a whole series of fast growing startups  the bloodline of any ecosystem  the press  a lot of it new york based  was all over it         not only was new york going to take over boston  it was also about to give silicon valley a major run for its money a lot of the above is still true  but unfortunately  there has been a number of hiccups along the way  a lot of the    poster child    companies that were frequently mentioned then have gotten into various levels of trouble  after raising large amounts of vc money  gilt      m raised  had an underwhelming exit  fab com      m raised  was a flameout  quirky      m raised  went bankrupt  foursquare      m raised  has been working on finding its second wind as a data company  there were some great acquisitions  tumblr   s     bn acquisition was a watershed moment   and some new york startups had ipos         but unfortunately  those newly public companies  like many others across the country  experienced difficulties in the public markets  etsy went from a     bn market cap at ipo to     bn currently  ondeck went from to     bn at ipo to less than     m currently   with shutterstock being the exception finally  there are a number of large startups in new york that have been doing quite well  but are now reaching the    year mark  and have yet to reach an exit all of this had led  perhaps not to    disillusionment     but certainly to more nuanced feelings  and people generally realizing how long it will truly take for new york to come into its own rinse and repeat  still earlias any student of emerging tech ecosystems knows  the key dynamic to success is the    rinse and repeat    cycle  you need several waves of successful tech companies to go through the whole cycle of founding  financing  scaling and significant exit  post exit  the hope is that successful founders  employees and investors then contribute back both money and expertise to the next generation of tech startups  a few of which eventually become highly successful themselves and then provide money and expertise to the following generation the trouble is  each successive cycle takes years  because the average successful startup takes   to    years to get to a large exit one key reason the silicon valley has become such a powerful network is that this    rinse and repeat    cycle has been happening there for decades  at least since the     s and     s  hewlett packard   with a real acceleration in the     s and     s  apple ipo  founding of kleiner perkins  etc  at the other end of the spectrum  some of the more recent tech hubs are arguably just at the beginning of their second cycle  in paris  for example  the next cycle is under way  with alumni of successful startups like criteo or exalead creating a number of new ventures  such as algolia and dataiku  but those are still relatively young    or   years in  new york is somewhere in the middle  but probably still on the earlier side         perhaps   cycles in  the comparative lack of exits doesn   t help  as it slows down when the next cycle starts  the point here is that  while new york is well on its way  things take time  and you can   t just hope to rush through cycles         getting to a fully mature tech ecosystem will require continued patience nyc talent is  finally  maturnow  to the bull case about new york one particularly apparent aspect  from my perspective  there is now a much larger pool of experienced startup talent to choose from it   s certainly not perfect         as mentioned above  there are just not that many people who have been repeatedly through the growth stages of the startup life  but new york has come a long way in a few years  not so long ago  when looking for  say  a vp of marketing  or someone to run operations  startup founders often needed to really stretch         could that agency person somehow figure out the marketing job  could that smart associate from goldman sachs learn the operations role on the job that   s much less the case now  there are a bunch of people in the system who have now worked at   or   startups in the past  even companies like fab and quirky  despite not making it past the goal line  have produced legions of experienced talent  who have now joined other startups or started their own there   s also an interesting emerging phenomenon around people starting to leave the nyc outposts of the various west coast tech giants after several years of service there         google  in particular  whose impact on nyc has been incredible   but also facebook  twitter  microsoft         to join or start nyc startups  for example  the three founders of cockroach labs  in the firstmark portfolio  are all former senior engineers at google who moved east to work at google new york  and then decided to remain in new york to start new ventures finally  we   re seeing an increasing number of people who are moving from the bay area to new york  some are people who are originally from the east coast  or went to school there  and decide to move back after a few years in the bay area  because they want to live in new york  others are executives with no particular history on the east coast  who are recruited into nyc startups         the interesting trend here being that those execs feel increasingly comfortable that there is enough density of quality startups in nyc that they could find another great job  should this one not work out a broader  deeper ecosystemthe other big story about new york is that it is no longer just about ad tech  media  commerce and fashion tech  in fact  it hasn   t been for years  but perceptions are slow to evolve  and it seems to still be what many people outside of new york seem to believe one way of thinking about new york   s tech history is one of gradual layers  perhaps something like this certainly  the areas that put nyc on the map in the first place continue to be strong  new york is the epicenter of the redefinition of media  buzzfeed  vice  business insider  mic  mashable  bustle  etc    and also home to many great companies in adtech  appnexus  tapad  mediamath  moat  yieldmo  magnetic  jw player  etc    marketing  outbrain  taboola  etc  and commerce  barkbox  birchbox  harry   s  jet com  warby parker  bonobos  rent the runway  etc   but new york has seen explosive entrepreneurial activity across a much broader cross section of verticals and horizontals  including for example a number of those companies are scaling very significantly  while    unicorn    status and or large amounts of vc money certainly do not guarantee success  as seen above   it is worth noting some recent large rounds for companies such as wework      m series f   oscar      m series c   vice media      m growth equity round   flatiron health      m series c   betterment      m series e   via      m series c   vroom     m series c   datadog       m series d   iex group     m series c   digital asset     m venture round   series a   invision     m series d   giphy     m series c  or vts     m series c  the rise of deep tech in new yorkfinally  one trend i   m personally particularly excited about  the emergence of deep tech startups in new york  by    deep tech     i mean startups focusing on solving hard technical problems  either in infrastructure or applications         the type of companies where virtually every early employee is an engineer  or a data scientist  for a long time  mongodb was pretty much the lone deep tech startup in nyc  there are many more now  a few of those are in my portfolio at firstmark  actioniq  cockroach labs  hyperscience and x ai  but there   s a lot of others  big and small  including for example      data  advance   bettercloud  blockstack labs  chainalysis  clarifai  datadog  dataminr  dextro  digital ocean  enigma  geometric intelligence  jethro  keybase  placemeter  security scorecard  sisense  syncsort or yhat         and a few others the new york data and ai community  in particular  keeps getting stronger  facebook   s ai department is anchored in new york by yann lecun  one of the fathers of deep learning  ibm watson   s global headquarter is in nyc  when slack decided to ramp up its effort in data  it hired nyc based noah weiss  former vp of product at foursquare  to head its search learning and intelligence group  nyu has a strong center for data science  also started by lecun   ron brachman  the new director of the technion cornell insititute  is an internationally recognized authority on artificial intelligence  columbia has a data science institute  nyc has many data startups  prominent data scientists and great communities  such as our very own data driven nyc   conclushype often precedes the reality of any market  this was very much the case for the new york tech ecosystem  but nyc is now growing into its reputation as an added bonus  the new york tech community continues to feel truly special  perhaps because nyc is still in the    underdog    phase  there   s a spirit of openness  collaboration and solidarity that is very palpable         almost ironic considering the reputation of new yorkers at firstmark  we feel proud to be part of this community  do our best to keep building it  through our four monthly events  data driven  design driven  code driven and hardwired   and we are more bullish than ever about new york note and update  this post is meant to be a few thoughts on the topic  rather than a proper    state of the union    of new york tech  there are several interesting themes i haven   t mentioned  and a number of people and companies that are pillars of the ecosystem and would be naturally included in any    state of the union    type post  including for example and in no particular order vc at firstmarkthe life  work  and tactics of entrepreneurs around the world         by founders  for founders  welcoming submissions on technology trends  product design  growth strategies  and venture investing
