thi transcript ha been automat gener and may not be accur hello thi is your money matter from the last return all mini are mani york anti new priestess by now you ve probabl caught between to the mega merger that he s eighteen t time warner heard on the street podcast discu the opportun in time warner share thi is go on from the wall street journal into the street the podcast we are the wall street journal s poll for commentari on all thing financi all over the world report from new york i hear ian got free join by my colleagu ken brown and justin lee baca to have the guy sign in time for go to chat about the mega merger that ha been that at the top of everyon s mind thi week and that s a tt s propos deal for time warner so miriam thi is you get to talk about it on the euro thi time and so you work thi is there s noth wors than be on vacat in it when a big deal the great to be veri unwis in itali but she she gain a gain jump into the stori on thi weekend short piec um that s pretti interest lee she look it so much polit opposit to thi deal aam and so a lot of peopl say it may not go through and which he did wa look at the compani s effort to time warner and said actual whether it go through or not there s some valu than twenti you with what made you to that conclus well i mean in investor a you might ve read that have been dow had been realli discount the possibl of the steel be improv but if you think about it i aam you know that just if the deal get reject that doesn t necessarili mean that think for time warner first of all it s the rel stabl bed in a kind of wild world of medium stock aam becaus it ha pretti good earn a haze it buy back stock which investor alik and it also ha kind of been seen a a sort of fall further from some of the thing that are take place in medium becaus it channel are some of the most popular one so if you re move too skinni bundl which are the smaller bundl of channel that mani compani are start to offer and mani peopl were tri to save money or to are switch to time warner s channel are probabl can in the air so it s a pretti safe bet a foreign medium stock even if the deal doesn t go through and you know of cours there might be other merger partner after so so it is to realli happen with the deal is compani get a quiet sue in thi case eighteen t fire someon and that the share of the compet report show up close the deal price in and you know everyon is veri excit and thi deal doesn t go through the share collaps and so what happen here wa the share they went up a littl bit but it wa in a lot of enthusiasm so where s that were the share now on one with a sort of impli share are right about that at the share are at eighti dollar rough the deal i will what is the deal that the deal the deal on the deal wa announc wa valu at one hundr and seven dollar and fifti cent each i it s fallen slightli sinc then becaus half of the deal and stop but it s still the so the pretti wide gap between these two price so the name is is basic just becaus peopl just don t think thi deal wa can happen or that they the put it on to the pretti pretti low what whi is that well i mean immedi after the deal wa announc everi politician and their mom came out and said they were oppos to includ the two pre presidenti candid on what hillari clinton said her industri should take a close look at the trump said he would reject it and we tri to undo comcast acquisit of nbc univers which close in twenti eleven and which is a similar deal to thi the right and it s been a lot of servic pack or after the fact that my past that s that that s right i mean the peopl and said that they said the govern put in place mani mani differ condit the comcast would have to follow in order to prove that teal and some peopl have said it s been difficult to enforc those condit and mayb the govern should not approv that deal aam there s also just been a regulatori climat that s been realli were the regul have been will in gener to reject merger these awesom big merger attract aam you know the ftc you gave a thumb down to stapl offic depot in the medium sector we had comcast arena by time warner cabl that wa it that fell apart becaus of regulatori concern alm so we are a number of exampl of decenc it wa that wa back in twenti eleven the and that wa him that not necessarili the same set of regul i aam on all front but you know ye that ani team in twenti eleven eighteen t tri to bite t mobil and the deal wa also blown apart and regul so so funni is thi anoth risk to be mean le of the deal doesn t go far right and regul of resist it could be that the issu they rais right knee deep or have a gift to anyon come in and find time order so that for that you re talk that mayb it s not mayb soar after the fact is that while he now know wa can a school i don t think that s possibl becaus i think that the opposit the opposit that the with the breez would be more relat to a mean of cours everyth s possibl i d i think the the sea of opposit new agre to be more relat to the fact that eighteen t is a larg custom of time which mean you know that it can be and that also he alway broadband pipe that that which could priorit and one or contact our wireless net a wireless network that can prepar testament content hwi report that appl wa poke tire and time warner i don t think regul would have the same set of object to appl purchas or not not say appl s confin to either other opinion about the but they are there would be otherwis ani we had twenti for sentri fox interest in buy in and make an offer so i think there are other buyer becaus it is it s a uniqu asset and you know there s just no other way to get access to the needi soul we re go to have an elect in the marina have new regul come in aam or new politician and regul what the time while the compani have said that they expect the deal to close by the end of twenti seventeen the comcast nbc you deal it took thirteen month to close so that sound roughli about the same thi one could take longer aam you know and the polit hurdl could caus it to extend longer than him it s a long time to weigh it certainli is and with that we are go to happen and there
