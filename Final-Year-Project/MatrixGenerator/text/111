original interview  http   www techiesproject com mylene hortaleza why don   t we start at the beginning  tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i was born in seattle  but my dad was in the navy so we moved around a bit  when i was    we moved to the philippines where i lived for    years  so i pretty much grew up there what was it like growing up there  especially as someone who had a taste of the states it was difficult at first because i didn   t speak filipino  so i had a tutor to learn it  it was weird at first because obviously i look filipino  but other kids treated me differently because i didn   t speak the language and i sounded different  but i was young so i adjusted quickly  i started college when i was    and majored in computer science  the plan was always to come back to u s after we graduate  but i had a little detour in my senior year  i had an unplanned pregnancy  it was really difficult being in a catholic university in a conservative and predominantly catholic country  i felt like i disappointed my parents and was a cause of embarrassment in the family  i was a good kid  i had good grades and a good life  i just made a bad decision  i was fortunate that my mom really pushed for me to finish college  a lot of other girls in the same situation would have dropped out of school because the family wouldn   t be able to face that embarrassment  i got married then a few months later i had my daughter i had to postpone a final project presentation because she arrived   weeks early  because i was busy with my senior year  i didn   t have time to attend childbirth classes or read books  i didn   t even know an epidural existed until years later  a week after giving birth  i had to go back to school for final exams  i wasn   t planning on attending graduation but i found out that i graduated cum laude and actually  rd in my class  my parents attended and they were happy and proud of me after graduation  my husband and i each moved back with our parents  my parents offered to look after my daughter so i could work  my mom was a stay at home mom and didn   t get to use her engineering degree and she said    i want you to have a career     but in the small hometown where we lived  there were no software jobs  this was back in      and unless you lived in manila  there wasn   t much to do with a cs degree not that i had the time or energy to really think about my career  i was pretty much in survival mode and all i needed was a job so i can feed my baby  i got a job teaching at a small technical college and after a semester  i worked for another company but didn   t really use much related to cs  my husband and i split up in the meantime  it was a lot of stress for a young marriage what did you do to try to turn things around after my daughter turned    i decided it was time to come back to the us to find a better job  my sister was kind enough to lend me money for a one way ticket to texas where she and my other sister lived  the hardest part was leaving my daughter with my parents  but i had to until i could find a job and be able to afford to support the both of us  it was pretty scary  it was      during a recession and it was hard to find a job  i had a few temp jobs doing random things  like sorting mail and data entry  finally  a small software company hired me to do customer service  i was able to save some money  and after   months of being apart  my parents brought my daughter here  i stayed at that company for   years  and i went from customer service to qa  in the middle of this  i remarried then after   years got divorced to get out of an unhealthy relationship  on top of that i had         in debt  i really made all my stupid decisions in my   s i then moved to a big semiconductor company where i stayed for   years  my life started stabilizing in my   s  it took me   years to get completely get out of debt  i was making better money  and i was in a healthy relationship  after thanksgiving in       most of our business unit got laid off  it was my first time to experience this  it was scary especially being in a single income household all these years i was in a career crisis  i didn   t really know what i wanted to be when i grow up  chuckle   i always hear    follow your passion    but this was never clear to me  i have a lot of things i   m interested in but none that i   m both passionate about and am good enough at to make a living  if i had followed that advice  i   d probably be a failed travel blogger  so back to getting laid off  part of our package was tuition reimbursement  the idea was for the company to pay for you to acquire some skill to get a new job  it wasn   t enough money to get a new degree and believe it or not  i used to dream up my ideal job and think  if only i studied to become a lawyer or an accountant  in the end  i thought  okay  practically speaking  with this amount  what can i do  well  i have a cs degree and i haven   t written a single line of code since i graduated so maybe i should learn a new language  i searched for the top jobs in my field  i looked at jobs at google  amazon  and apple  and i was just curious  what kind of skills are they looking for  long story short  i signed up for an online python class  it was difficult at first to get started  but i realized that the concepts that i knew were the same  just the syntax was different  it was like falling in love again  it was exciting solving each problem  the same feeling i had solving problems in basic when i was    and pascal in college in the meantime  amazon had contacted me and many of my co workers through linkedin because a lot of the skills we had in embedded software were what they were looking for  i went for the interview thinking     this is really going to be a practice interview  there   s no way i   m moving to california      chuckle   i got a job offer  and it was compelling enough for me to consider it  it was a hard decision to leave my support system  and move to a place that i   ve never been to before where the cost of living is just so high the move turned out to be the best thing that happened to my career  i continued learning python and applying it at work  i found that the better i got  the more i felt enjoyment and passion in my work  the move also turned out to be great for my daughter  being able to play in one of the top high school drum lines in the us  she cried at first because she would be leaving friends and going to a new high school  but she said     if you think that   s what best for us  then i will support you    like a little adult yeah  i think because it   s just the two of us  i tend to talk with her about everything  including finances  so she understood why we made the move  anyway  i feel like i have so much energy and desire to learn new things  next year she   ll be off to college so i   ll even have more time to focus and go on to the next phase of my career what a story  what overall is the most exciting to you about working in tech  what things are you really proud of and what about the work really activates you what i love about working in tech is being able to work on products that change people   s lives  i read the reviews on amazon echo and it   s amazing to see how customers use device  especially disabled people  it   s pretty exciting and inspiring people are speculating that technology like the echo is the future yes it   s very exciting to be part of that i   m curious to know what it was like culturally going from the philippines to texas  then from texas to silicon valley culturally  going from the philippines to texas was a breath of fresh air for me  in the philippines there was such a stigma of being a single parent  you and your child get either judged or pitied on  hopefully things have changed there since then  regarding moving from dallas to the bay area  i love the culture of learning and trying to be the best at what you do  there are so many movements  organizations  meet ups in tech that it   s not hard for the enthusiasm to rub off on you  i   m not saying it didn   t exist in dallas  but maybe i just was not in that environment what has your experience been work wise as a single mother the biggest difference for me is not being able to travel for business  it has to be planned and i could only go if i had someone i trusted  like my parents  to look after my child  i think that being a parent is hard whether you   re a single parent or part of a two parent household  as far as my daily work  when my daughter was younger  i had to force myself to be efficient because i didn   t have the luxury of staying extra hours if i didn   t manage my time well what   s it been like  leaving your support network in texas  and then trying to find support networks here  have you found them yet it was difficult leaving my family and friends  i   m a bit towards the introverted side  so it took effort and courage to put myself out there and make new friends  i mentioned that my daughter is in the drum line at her school   s marching band  volunteering for that enabled me to meet other parents who were very welcoming  it definitely involved getting out of my comfort zone have you had any particular mentors in your career yes  in texas i had a good manager who mentored me when i was new to qa  i   ve also had several good managers since i moved here  one managed me remotely from seattle and he always talked about improving my skills thinking not just about my current company but for my future career  i thought that was kind of refreshing  maybe that was another one of those cultural differences back in dallas where i didn   t feel like i could be that open with my managers about my career because if it may not line up with what is best for their team  you have this fear of being the first to go in a layoff if they knew you had any thoughts about leaving  here  no one expects you to stay in one place for    years  or even   years  so you can be much more open it   s like to keep you  they have to nurture that exactly  having a good manager is important to me  so when i interview  i make sure it goes both ways what do you look for in a job now compared to earlier in your career i look for somewhere where i can add value to team or company  in an environment that supports autonomy and creativity  it would be great to work on something that customers love  and i can say     i worked on that    how do your friends and family feel about how far you   ve come my parents were always supportive of me and cheered me on every step forward i made  today  i feel that i   ve made my parents proud  my daughter always thanks me for being a great mom  that means a lot to me how do you think the combination of your background and all of your life experiences impact the way that you approach your work i always come across difficult problems to solve at work  but they   re almost never as bad as the difficult problems i   ve had to face in life  i also am not confused anymore about what i want to do with my career  getting rid of that lingering doubt helps me focus better let   s go macro for a second  how do you feel about the state of tech in       like what is exciting to you  what frustrates you i think the connected home and internet of things will be big this year  i   m excited to be part of that  but i think it will be important for people to distinguish between the ones that improve your quality of life and others that are just innovation for innovation   s sake technology aside  i see a lot of exciting and frustrating moments about improving diversity in tech  women in tech in particular is close to my heart  having a daughter who is exploring careers and deciding what to major in  i see a lot of movement around this and i feel hopeful  she took java programming this year at school to test the waters and see if she liked it enough to minor in computer science  she had a good experience and now she is thinking about majoring in it  she might still change mind of course  but my hope is for her to experience a more gender diverse tech world than i did what are your goals for       either for work or for yourself i have a lot of goals  at the start of each year  i write my goals for the year and i like to revisit it throughout the year to see if i   m making progress  the career goal i set for myself this year was to switch roles from a qa engineer to a software development engineer in test  i talked with my manager about it and i   m happy to say that i am working on that transition now  my personal goals involve getting better at programming  reading more  traveling more  living healthier  watching more concerts  getting back into playing the drums and maybe even playing in a band where do you see yourself in five or ten years i would love to be a software developer and build something  in    years  i   d love to be able to at the top of my industry  i don   t know what that will look like yet  maybe those jobs don   t even exist yet  just like many of the tech jobs now didn   t exist    years ago my last question for you would be  what advice would you have for folks that are going through some hardships  or had crazy life obstacles thrown at them and are trying to figure out their career have a goal  make a plan and focus on the process of getting there  there are times when life is crazy that you don   t have the time or energy to even focus on your career  but it   s not always going to be a hardship  set realistic expectations given the situation that you currently have  for example  when the kids are young and you don   t have help  maybe all you can focus on is raising them and doing    good enough    at your job  accept that that   s where you are right now  they will get more independent as they grow  and you can execute on your plan one little step at a time  manage your time well  we all only have    hours in a day  figure out what   s important to you  for me  getting   hours of sleep is priority  if you feel like you never have the time or energy  try to identify and fix the unimportant things that suck up your time  or things that cause you stress  it might be debt  health  relationship stress  read books and learn from other people on how to deal with these problems  there   s no need to learn all of life   s lessons the hard way  it makes it easier to work on your career when you can lessen or eliminate other stresses in your life  lastly  for parents  don   t let your life revolve around your children  they will turn     graduate and be on their own  don   t forget to treat yourself with love and kindness words from a
