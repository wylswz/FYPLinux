original interview  http   www techiesproject com bo ren hi  hello  okay  before we start  are there any particular topics that you want to go deep into for this interview i   m pretty interested in cognitive diversity  not just racial or any particular backgrounds  but rather being able to think outside of a very homogenous fashion  i   m also passionate about helping asian americans crack the bamboo ceiling we   ll dig into that okay  sweet let   s start at the beginning  tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i was born in china  and then i came here when i was four  lived in ann arbor for like three years through second grade  my dad was a researcher  he came here on a world health fellowship  and stayed to do research in the hearing sciences we moved to portland when i was seven  and stayed there until high school  portland was fairly white  and homogenous in that sense  so i definitely felt like my childhood was fairly sheltered  as an only child  i was sheltered and given all the resources to succeed  which a luxury  luckily  my tiger parents were good about giving me room to roam  i went to usc on a full ride scholarship but i just hated college how so i chose usc for a purely rational reason         no debt         but it was the wrong culture for me  i think the general disconnect had to do with the overall the la orange county bubble  i went for the academics  but i also expected a certain life experience and social aspect  i did find my groove eventually  but the first two years were really hard on me  i was different and didn   t really fit in at usc  i kind of boomeranged around  i started pre med and then realized i didn   t love advanced chemistry and i actually failed a test for the first time in my life  i had a pre med counselor who was like     i think you should find the intersection between what you   re good at and what you enjoy     he was like     you have really good interpersonal skills  you should think about something related to that    i decided to pursue a joint degree in psych and econ  i discovered an emerging area called neuroeconomics  i really enjoyed blending sciences and disciplines because i never felt like i was very good at one thing  growing up i felt proficient in most things  but i wasn   t amazing in one thing  my true forte was blending ideas in an interdisciplinary way where i can bridge information and connect gaps  i identify as a multipotentialite  someone who has many creative pursuits and no one particular calling in life so you graduated with psych and econ degrees  walk me on the path from that to being a pm the path to pm was nonlinear and circuitous  my career has been very stochastic full of many detours  i graduated after the big financial crisis in       after college i decided to take a year off and apply to law school  i moved back to portland and worked for a non profit called the aclu  which was an eye opening experience  working on the aclu really opened my eyes in terms of what i wanted in a non profit  i wanted to go into nonprofit legal consulting and bring a little bit of for profit efficiency to non profits  seeing an organization like the aclu struggle super hard during the recession and seeing people lose morale was hard  being in an environment where people join because they were true believers and then become disillusioned by the economics and the inefficiencies was a huge turnoff  my experience at the aclu made me question if there was a market for nonprofit law after i applied to law school  i decided to travel through asia for a couple of months  i came to sf to pick up my chinese visa  around that time  my very good friend from college and her boyfriend moved here and he started working at sunrun  a solar startup  one day i went to visit their office and i was really blown away by how young everyone was  at non profits  usually you   ve been there for a while  but everyone at sunrun was super young and fun once i got a taste of that environment which was very palpable         smart people having a good time         i knew i had to be part of the action  i just wanted a foot in the door  i applied to every job opening at sunrun  i slept on a futon for a couple weeks in berkeley and just interviewed around my first job at sunrun was a customer service rep job  i remember jumping up and down in a restaurant bathroom when i got the call that i got the job  it paid pennies but it didn   t matter because i wanted that job so badly  working at sunrun wasn   t a linear path like law school or med school  i was just going to give it a year to see how it would work out  i was going to defer law school  have a great time in sf  and then go back on the linear safe path i worked there while it was under     and i was the second girl on our customer support team  i started answering phone calls from really angry customers         just being yelled at by people for a good eight hours a day was pretty character building  i started relaying a lot of their really angry complaints over to our product team  and try to categorize and bucket them into clusters of problems  that was when i realized  wow there   s this domain called product management and they   re all really smart and elite people at sunrun  but everyone came from a certain pedigree  it was a stanford  gsb company where mostly stanford kids were able to do the cool stuff  it was very clear to me i was an underdog from a tier two school  and it would take a great deal to crack into product it took me a while to even understand what product management is because everyone had their own definition  i took every pm out to lunch and coffee and just tried to understand how they got to where they are  they were all skeptical  saying    you don   t have a degree in computer science  or you don   t have an mba     that was binary  you had to either have one or the other in order to be a pm  and i was like     well  if i don   t have any of these  what can i do to win over credibility    so i started doing a time share with our director of product and convinced our hr team to give me an opportunity where i can do     product and     customer care and that was the first time anyone had done that  i was basically doing two people   s jobs because it   s never going to be fifty fifty perfectly  a lot was expected out of me and i was basically compared to someone who had just joined the company with four or five years of product within solar  it was really hard because i worked hard  but i also didn   t have the right context for things  nor the experience  at the end of that trial period         it was supposed to be three months         i kind of knew i wasn   t going to get an offer  the director expected a lot out of me  rightfully so  but it still hurt because it felt like i tried my hardest but wasn   t good enough  from there  i was like     well  if i can   t do product at sunrun  i can try to approximate into product     that was when i decided to apply to opower which was still going to be within the same renewable clean tech space  but i would finally work at a software company  i joined as a technical project manager  i think opower was a really great move for me in the sense i felt like i got closer to the software and technical side  opower was great in the sense that for the first time  i got to work with engineers  and they hired me to do a lot of implementation work  integrating their core platform with the utility clients the entire opower product is based off of behavioral science  which i get because that   s what i studied in college  every product was based off this study by robert cialdini where he found out people will consume less power when they   re compared to other people similar to them  so it   s kind of like tapping into the whole keeping up with the joneses complex  yeah  i had a great time there  but ultimately i didn   t have the pedigree they wanted for product  a lot of their non technical folks were able to go into product  but then they hired a vp of product who came from google  and basically was like we   re switching our entire product org to be like google  again i was back in the position where you either you have a computer science degree or an mba to be a pm  so i basically was like     fuck     i   m in the same boat as i was before even though i   m pretty damn sure i can do the job  because all the work i was doing as a technical project manager was very much like routing feedback over to product  so from there i was like  well  if i can   t make inroads into product within this company  then i should just look externally  and that was when sigfig reached out to me sigfig a financial services startup  they said they needed someone who could do partnerships  project management  and a little bit of product  so in a way i was able to leverage my strengths as a project manager  but also negotiate my way into product too  they hired to me to work on partnerships with aol and yahoo finance  they promised me    after you launch these partnerships  we   ll give you an opportunity to do product     for me that was the turning point where i had to stop trying to prove to people         like i can do product  give me a chance  now i finally have the pm title while doing this hybridized role i was very much enamored by the fact that i could work at a series a company and finally work as a pm  my degree of naivete really got me to take the plunge without that first assessing the company scrupulously  do they have the right product market fit  are they making money  and the answers were no  laughter   so as a pm there i basically did everything from working on partnerships  to building out a new investment tool product  all the way to operations helping them manually sign up people  it was just a lot of schlepping  and i think that experience made me realize the pm role is so not glamorous  i lost a lot of hair in my first couple of months just from the sheer stress  working at a company where you don   t know if it   s going to be alive in a year or two from now was terrifying  i think in one day i cried four times once         once in the bathroom  once in the alley outside office  on my home  and then finally at home i felt like i was expected to pick up this company and put it together when everything else was collapsing around me  i tried really hard and basically lived at work before realizing it wasn   t going to work out  i think the most harrowing experience wasn   t just the fact that i was set up for failure  it was the fact that i had a friend sabotage me at work i should have seen this coming  but i didn   t realize that we would have a conflict of interest in the sense  she knew me outside of work  she was doing legal for them  she was also doing hr  she was also doing ops and she basically knew exactly how much everyone made  and she found out that she was the person paid the least even though she had a law degree  and i noticed over time that she had a sense of bitterness building up  she started sabotaging me at work  she quoted things from lean in and sheryl sandberg saying things like     i   m just trying to help you  women have to help each other out     she told me    no knows what you   re doing at this company  you need to join operations full time and work under me     she tried to manipulate the ceo into thinking that none of my work was substantial  and i started doing ops work for her because she didn   t know how to automate the customer sign up process  i found out i was reporting to her  which was really strange  there was huge conflict of interest  then over time she started stripping away my responsibilities and cutting me out in meetings  and basically just tried to squeeze me slowly  i realized that she was out to get to get me  when one of the other pms there was like     she   s not your friend anymore  you need to watch your back    that was when i started cc ing our ceo on every email  and basically making sure that there was one source of truth  instead of her saying     i talked to the ceo and this is what he wants you to do     i never felt that degree of violation nor mistrust in anyone in my life  i think up until that point i had always thought people had your best interest at heart  i never had a mindset of protecting myself from someone who was the offender  that to me was kind of a huge pop to my ego  and my world view just really changed afterwards         not everyone has your best interest at heart in this world that sense of betrayal was also just a huge loss of innocence for me  i was very bitter after i left the company in the sense it wasn   t just a job that didn   t work out  it also was a friendship that betrayed me  i decided to take time off and figure out what i really wanted to do because i feel like when you go through that degree of relationship trauma as well as work trauma  it makes you question everything  and i started questioning my relationship with sf three years in asking myself     is this a place where i want to be long term  do i even want to be a pm anymore     i gave myself a couple months off and lived on my savings  i told myself worst comes to worst  i   ll just move back to portland to my parents    house during that time  i started reflecting more and writing  i found writing to be very therapeutic for me because i was able to process a lot of the trauma  and stress  and ruminations  the absence of stress in my life was a great way to figure out what was wrong  i think it took my body actually two months to recover from working so hard and going through that traumatic startup experience  i remember hitting people up randomly on twitter  and connecting with people   s writing  and meeting them in real life         there is no agenda  i wasn   t going to go out and get a job  it was more like i just wanted to talk to smart people and learn from them  and see if my aspiration in becoming a product manager was really grounded and was this the right direction for me  around that time i just also started applying  interviewing  and talking to start ups as well as larger companies  i remember there was this guy that i   d met a barbeque at stanford a year ago  he was a grad student who   s going over to work at facebook  so i asked him     what   s the pm profile there      because i never thought i would get into facebook  it was actually going to be a reach for me  i was curious about the pm philosophy there and i wanted to see which company i would align with the best  he had gone through his engineering camp with another girl who went through the rpm program  i remember calling her and she answer and she   s like     you have a     number      we bonded over the fact we   re both oregonians we just hit it off immediately and she had gone through similar experience which she had at a startup and realized all that glitters is not gold  she got into the facebook rpm program  which is like a rotational product management program so i applied  at that point i felt like i basically had zero fucks to give anymore  it was kind of like i had reached a point where i was like  if san francisco doesn   t work out  then i will just go back to portland and figure it out  and it kind of got to a point where because i stopped caring and talked to so many smart people  i started interviewing around without a deliberate attachment to an end outcome  i think i accelerated my own growth and learning around product  and was able to have conversations with people and interviews that felt very organic i don   t know how to describe it  but it   s almost like you find your flow to a certain degree  you   re writing about things  you   re reflecting  and you   re also just like            i just need to spread my luck surface area really thin     i would go out of my way to tell people about my startup experiences  being very open about what worked  what didn   t work  and around that time i think i started meeting a lot of random people off of twitter and also off of this coffeeme network  which was like tinder for professionals  i remember meeting this one girl named cindy wu who co founded a science crowdfunding start up  i told her about what happened and how much betrayal and trauma i had gone through  surprisingly  she was very not sympathetic  she was like     so what are you going to do next     and that moment of her asking    what are you going to do next     was lightening  i can commiserate  i can complain all i want  i can write about all this  but essentially it   s not going to help me move on and that was really key for me  i started reaching out to companies that i didn   t even think i would have a chance  i felt like i found my flow talking about my story  it seemed very nonsensical         how did you go from pre law to solar to energy efficiency to fintech but looking back  all these companies had something in common  that was behavioral change  trying to get people to switch from using the utility power to go solar  trying to motivate people to use less power  and trying to encourage the everyday person to invest more  i had subconsciously been attracted to companies that had a certain behavioral change component  i feel like if you tell your narrative enough times you find certain patterns  so around the time that i actually interviewed at facebook  i literally felt i was so in the flow the interview became a series of organic conversations i didn   t think i would get the offer  i also had an offer from another start up that i had been very interested in  and basically i would have worked as the second pm  i started weighing the cost of benefits if i stay in the startup world or do i go to a larger company and learn from the best  i came to the conclusion i just want to be the best generalists as possible and go to a place where i can learn through osmosis and be with smarter people there   s a certain degree of impostor syndrome going into a company like facebook where i don   t have the pedigree and i don   t have the cs degree or the mba  i am surrounded by very high achieving people who got this job straight out of college  i felt like every step along the way i had to prove to people that you should give me a chance  i have the potential  maybe not the background  i also felt to a certain degree like a martyr  every employer had underestimated me  and i had proven them wrong  chuckles   but as long as i don   t underestimate myself  that was the key to me moving forward  i don   t think i intentionally tried to be a job hopper  i think every single company i worked for i wanted to stay for four years  sunrun was two and a half years and then the opower and sigfig stints were more brief  but i   ve never intentionally been like     i need to leave     i think that circumstances change  and your relationship with your employer is very much a personal relationship too and there are variables out of your control  for me  it   s always been like there needs to be some type of value compromise where i feel cared for so i can give you my all  i think i just have a lower threshold for what is acceptable and know what i deserve but in retrospect  you can connect the dots and be like     oh  this is why     and i still live in this kind of optimistic uncertain way  where i don   t know what i   m going to do in six months from now or a year from now  i don   t see a straight linear path  but it   s worked out so far by surprise  chuckles   i feel like that a lot of people who don   t have the pedigree nor the background  nor the linear path end up taking a harder path like me  but you have a more rich and interesting story i started writing because i wanted to reflect on these hardships and figure out what i could extract in order to process the trauma and the emotions  i was writing for relief  i didn   t write for an audience  writing is a very personal thing  i remember writing about my first    days as a pm and how i started losing my hair  which really resonated with people because i didn   t hold back  i admitted how scared i was and shared lessons  trials  and pitfalls  me putting that out there on the internet was very cathartic  but it also rewarded me for taking a risk  i didn   t know other people were also struggling in the same way as i did  i started creating this reinforcing cycle where as long as i   m open and honest and vulnerable in my writing the internet embraced it  people started reaching out to me and meeting me in person  we connected over shared hardships was really magical  i was like     wow  i didn   t know i could meet so and so because i thought they were super accomplished and they sound really fancy on the internet     but i read their work and they read my work and by the time we met  it was like a third or fourth conversation in  there was no small talk  i think that type of virtuous cycle of putting yourself out there  making yourself vulnerable  but then connecting with someone else unexpected the internet   s secret power as a multipotentialite who has many callings and curiosities  i don   t think i am going to be a pm forever  i enjoy writing far more and i also enjoy connecting with people and meeting them and figuring out what makes them tick  and who can i connect them to help activate their ideas and passions  i don   t really know a job that embodies those aspects  maybe venture   but in the meantime i want to work on things as close as possible to writing  publishing  and media because i think that   s where my passion is  when i   m passionate about something  work just doesn   t feel like work  right yep so  i   m still trying to find that alignment  i just don   t know where  or when  chuckles  what have been some of the struggles that you   ve experienced over the years in the industry that have inspired a lot of your writing i started out writing about product management in order to establish credibility because i felt like unless i had some way of visibly putting myself out there and saying     these are the things i learn and these are the things i did     people wouldn   t give me the benefit of the doubt i really felt like i had to overcome a lot of initial bias  and me establishing myself as an expert in product management would be a way to give me instant credibility  and also prove to people that someone with my non traditional background can still do the job  writing about product management from a diverse background helped change the industry mold for a pm  once i got my facebook offer i wrote about why we should give liberal arts majors a chance  it was partly due to the fact that i felt very different from everyone in the interview process  and i was told     you   re one of our diversity spots  like  we need to recruit people who are going to be different  and not have the cookie cutter background     and that made me think    why did i have to go through so much of those hardships    i wrote about why liberal arts actually trains you to be a good pm  and that really helped connect a lot of people to my story  and people who also felt like they couldn   t crack into it because of their non traditional background  i wanted to prove to people that you can differentiate yourself  in fact  those things that do make you different can add up and help you become a really great pm  when i go into a meeting i don   t think i know everything  and that makes me more inquisitive  the fact that i come from a very diverse background of econ and psych makes me think about problems differently i wanted to bring awareness around cognitive diversity  you can come from a different background whether cultural  education  or gender  you can look at the world through a different lens  point of view is not something we can really measure  but i think you can extract someone   s worldview and perspective through their writing  through writing i could share about what made me different  all those disadvantages that made me different became strengths over time  and other people could resonate with my differences  and in a way it felt by writing about cognitive diversity and hardships i could over time change the industry norm that a pm had to be a cookie cutter  cs degree major  mba  or someone who had ivy league degree  beyond labels you are a patchwork of different identities and experiences  and that   s what makes you really strong at the end of the day honestly  i think i write very much about personal experiences  as long as i keep going through life trying new things and meeting new people  and experience new things i will continue generating content  but i can   t say i only write x  it   s a mix  there   s pieces of social commentary  there   s pieces of psychology  there   s pieces of tech  and then there   s pieces of my own personal experience  so i don   t really know how to call it  what genre  maybe the modern human condition  hopefully one day i will be able to write a book  but i don   t really know what that would be  i did have a friend who just published a memoir  and he   s like twenty six  twenty seven i think i love that so i feel like i should secretly start writing my own memoir until i actually do something of substance  and then have the ability to publish it my plan for this year         my resolution         is to start writing a memoir yes  do it and just cover the first twenty eight years people don   t want to admit that they   ve been preparing their memoir for awhile  but can you imagine being forty five and then looking back and being like  what did i do in this world  you actually do need to prepare yourself i   m curious to hear your thoughts on the current state of tech in       what   s exciting to you  what frustrates you i definitely have a love hate relationship with tech as well as with san francisco  i think part of it is just the fact that i am morbidly afraid of only having one way of looking at things  every time i get out of san francisco i   m always so relieved that i   m no longer in this very insulating and myopic space  i think people have been generating successful companies in a very homogeneous  formulaic manner  you need to have gone to certain school or worked at a certain company  and then from there you meet certain people  and then you generate ideas together  and then you get funding  there   s just so much in bred talent  it   s almost like everyone   s a purebred  and over time purebreds breed with purebreds and there is no hybrid vigor  ideas just get more and more diluted  a lot of ideas behind products are serving the one percent  when you don   t have an awareness of how other people live then you keep circulating the same ideas  my biggest concern is how homogeneous and monoculture we can become  for example  yesterday i went to garfield community pool  it was kind of like a shitty pool with beat up locker rooms  it was not your nice  posh gym  but everyone there was nice  i had like five people tell me     have a good swim     you know  i just felt like  wow  these are the type of people who come to a pool for a sense of community  not to further themselves  i want to be with real people without self interested motivations i think a lot of what the industry has turned into is like  how can i further myself and be the next unicorn  it   s not about connecting with other people  and i even feel this through networking  like so and so makes and intro         they want to connect with me and i feel obligated to talk to them because they   re a mutual friend  right  when i was in tel aviv people who didn   t know me would like offer to connect me to someone else  there was no notion of a referral system based on social currency  tel aviv had a culture of default openness when you are driven by motives         and a certain how i should replicate a pattern of success         you stop thinking about new ideas  and you kind of stop innovating  right  so i think right now it   s just like there   s too much homogenous thinking  there   s a certain pattern of success that everyone wants to replicate and be the next blank  and be the next unicorn  right  and there   s not enough awareness of what is going on outside of the bay area  what   s the rest of the world doing  when i was talking to startups in tel aviv  they were like     yeah we know the israeli market is super small  so every product we make we think about building this for the rest of the world     and i don   t think a lot of companies within the bay area think about it  because it   s like they   re preoccupied with who   s going to be on techcrunch  who   s going to be featured on product hunt  do i know the right person  who   s going to retweet me  and it   s all become like this insular circle jerking community of like     you recommend me  i recommend you     i don   t think tech in the bay area is as open and authentic anymore  and it makes me sad because i want to be friends with people  not because they work at x  i want to be friends with people because i genuinely appreciate them  and we have something in common  and it   s not just over work or us working in an industry i want to meet more people like i did at the community pool  they were just by default very open and nice  and they came to a pool to have a good time and to exercise  it wasn   t in order to meet certain types of people  and i see that with networking too  where people are very motive driven  and it   s like     what can i do for you  what can you do for me     and that immediate transactional relationship carries throughout the entire industry now  and i don   t know how to correct it  i don   t want to be friends with people in order to get something out of it  and i think there   s a certain degree of reciprocity in every relationship we have that   s not immediate  right  so i honestly am kind of sad by the current state and i can always tell when some company is going to be the next cool kid  but i know that cool kid title will never be sustained  right everyone plays in the whole like     maximize your mentality  i need to be the next big thing  and i need to be super flashy and sexy     and to a certain degree i don   t think sustainability is top of the mind  for you to be a world class company that really addresses human problems  you have to be sustainable over time too  right now  i   m just seeing a lot forgiving money getting doled out by virtue of someone having connections or someone having proven themselves once and then working on ideas for the one percent  i also see people just trying to get acquired super fast or trying to make some fast cash  that notion of sustainability of you working on a problem for a very long time and feeling like it   s solving human people problems  not just moving metrics or making a lot of money  is becoming lost vcs have to realize a lot of their investments are not going to pan out  in two years from now there   s like a cooling effect  which sounds really bad  but i actually think a cooling effect would be really good  because that   s going to separate the wheat from the chaff  the strong  sustainable companies that are doing it slow and deliberately and focus on solving people problems instead of lifestyle companies or things for the top    will last  i think that a cooling down effect will course correct things from the current trajectory  but at this point  it almost feels like the wolf of wall street a little bit let   s do one more question  what are some of the biggest lessons that you   ve learned  and what advice would you give to people from similar backgrounds  just like normal people  who aren   t ivy leaguers  who have the talent  and the aptitude  and the potential  but there   s kind of system in place that they   re going to have to swim upstream in  what advice would you have for those folks who want to get into tech i think a lot of it has to do with your own self worth  and you not letting defined standards make you feel that you   re not qualified  i think if you can generate something of value and make it visible  and show people i did this then you prove yourself  no one   s going to hire you based off of potential  if you don   t have the right background or pedigree  you   re always going to face a lot of doubt  and the best way to counteract doubt is to have a visible output of your work  right  whether that be you built something  you wrote something  you shared something with the world that was helpful  if you had enough time  i think you start building your own track record where it   s not about someone looking at your pedigree  but looking at what did you produce  what you generate is way more telling than someone who went to an ivy or someone who has an mba  i think in a way you almost have to come up with your own standards and definition for every role that you apply  i think if you do this enough times  there is less and less stigma against you in fact  my my narrative of having worked for  what is it  four companies now  it actually seems really interesting  but when i was going through it it was a shitty experience  i kept thinking    why can   t i just find a linear path to becoming a pm     so  i think if you see all those trials and tribulations as growth opportunities then you   ll will have a more interesting story to tell  you have to turn disadvantages into your advantage  i think if you feel like you   re not going to get into a certain job or company because of your pedigree  you should just start doing your own thing  if you do it enough times  that incremental value accumulates over time and it   s going to shift people   s focus on what you don   t have towards what you do have  which is like     i produced x    i think eventually if enough people do this         you basically debunk the whole system of you need to check these boxes in order to be qualified for something  and i   ve seen this trend in pms now  a lot of people aren   t hiring for technical backgrounds anymore because there are a lot of strong operators who can build stuff but they don   t validate if it   s the right product  how do you build products that connect with people and build an emotional connection  that   s not something you can learn through coding or through an mba program  there needs to be a certain degree of empathy and all those soft skills that people don   t measure actually add up  i don   t know how you can exemplify those soft skills without a really compelling narrative  me talking about how i think in terms of behavioral science and psychology when it comes to product development is very refreshing and different  to a certain degree  tech now has the fundamentals  we have the internet  and we have the cloud  it   s all about the next layer of human technology we can build  that degree of empathy is something that you have to earn through hardship and through failure  i feel like people who are at a disadvantage  it   s a blessing in disguise  you can   t let it keep you from doing what you
