march       was my first day of job back in       it has been gratifying journey till now  i should say i have been blessed in choices i have made    each new role  each new team in past    years has taught me something or other enthusiasm to learn and pickup things has stayed same  past    years i have also had privileged to work with some of the best  and most humble people  i can sum up past    years in    quotes by my managers books i read in different occassion i wish i remembered the source   which has created deep impact on me and shaped the way i think about lif it   s what we think we know keeps us away from learn hard work beats talent  when talent doesn   t work hard don   t wait to make right decision  take decision and make them right starting strong is good  finishing strong is ep be that guy to whom team turns to when shit hits the fan go to that extra mile it   s never crowd either you run your day or day runs you ov don   t burn the bridg we rise by lifting oth bad attitude is like flat tire  you will never go anywhere if you don   t change it if you want to go fast go alone    if you want to go far go with oth humility is not in thinking less of yourself  but thinking of yourself less take little more than your share of failure  and little less than your share of credit  smile happy looks good on y save mindlessly spend consci
