the traditional       workday is poorly structured for high productivity  perhaps when most work was physical labor  but not in the knowledge working world we now live in although this may be obvious based on people   s mediocre performance  addiction to stimulants  lack of engagement  and the fact that most people hate their jobs         now there   s loads of scientific evidence you can   t ignore the most productive countries in the world do not work   hours per day  actually  the most productive countries have the shortest workdays people in countries like luxembourg are working approximately    hours per week  approximately   hours per day    days per week  and making more money on average than people working longer workweeks this is the average person in those countries  but what about the super productive although gary vaynerchuck claims to work    hours per day  many    highly successful    people i know work between       hours per day it also depends on what you   re really trying to accomplish in your life  gary vaynerchuck wants to own the new york jets  he   s also fine  apparently  not spending much time with his family and that   s completely fine  he   s clear on his priorities however  you must also be clear on yours  if you   re like most people  you probably want to make a great income  doing work you love  that also provides lots of flexibility in your schedule if that   s your goal  this post is for you on average  i myself probably work between   and   hours per day  on days i have class  my workday is closer to   hours  on days i don   t have class  my workday is between       hours    wherever you are  make sure you   re there             dan sullivanif you   re like most people  your workday is a blend of low velocity work mixed with continual distraction  e g   social media and email  most people   s    working time    is not done at peak performance levels  when most people are working  they do so in a relaxed fashion  makes sense  they have plenty of time to get it done however  when you are results oriented  rather than    being busy     you   re     percent on when you   re working and     percent off when you   re not  why do anything half way  if you   re going to work  you   re going to work to get the best results in your fitness  research has found that shorter but more intensive exercise is more effective than longer drawn out exercise the concept is simple  intensive activity followed by high quality rest and recovery most of the growth actually comes during the recovery process  however  the only way to truly recover is by actually pushing yourself to exhaustion during the workout the same concept applies to work  the best work happens in short intensive spurts  by short  i   m talking       hours  but this must be    deep work     with no distractions  just like an intensive workout is non stop  interestingly  your best work         which for most people is thinking         will actually happen while you   re away from your work     recovering    in one study  only    percent of respondents reported getting creative insight while at work  ideas generally came while the person was at home  in transportation  or during recreational activity     the most creative ideas aren   t going to come while sitting in front of your monitor     says scott birnbaum  a vice president of samsung semiconductor the reason for this is simple  when you   re working directly on a task  your mind is tightly focused on the problem at hand  i e   direct reflection   conversely  when you   re not working  your mind loosely wanders  i e   indirect reflection  while driving or doing some other form of recreation  the external stimuli in your environment  like the buildings or other landscapes around you  subconsciously prompt memories and other thoughts  because your mind is wandering both contextually  on different subjects  and temporally between past  present  and future  your brain will make distant and distinct connections related to the problem you   re trying to solve  eureka  creativity  after all  is making connections between different parts of the brain case in point  when you   re working  be at work  when you   re not working  stop working  by taking your mind off work and actually recovering  you   ll get creative breakthroughs related to your work according to psychologist ron friedman  the first three hours of your day are your most precious for maximized productivity    typically  we have a window of about three hours where we   re really  really focused  we   re able to have some strong contributions in terms of planning  in terms of thinking  in terms of speaking well     friedman told harvard business review this makes sense on several levels  let   s start with sleep  research confirms the brain  specifically the prefrontal cortex  is most active and readily creative immediately following sleep  your subconscious mind has been loosely mind wandering while you slept  making contextual and temporal connections so  immediately following sleep  your mind is most readily active to do thoughtful work on a different level  the science of willpower and self control confirm that your willpower         or energy levels         are strongest immediately following sleep  the longer you go throughout your day  the less willpower you have  in other words  you experience decision fatigue throughout your day so  your brain is most attuned first thing in the morning  and so are your energy levels  consequently  the best time to do your best work is during the first three hours of your day i used to exercise first thing in the morning  not anymore  i   ve found that exercising first thing in the morning actually sucks my energy  leaving me with less than i started lately  i   ve been waking up at  am  driving to my school and walking to the library i work in  while walking from my car to the library  i drink a     calorie plant based protein shake  approximately    grams of protein  donald layman  professor emeritus of nutrition at the university of illinois  recommends consuming at least    grams of protein for breakfast  similarly  tim ferriss  in his book  the   hour body  also recommends    grams of protein    minutes after awaking protein rich foods keep you full longer than other foods because they take longer to leave the stomach  also  protein keeps blood sugar levels steady  which prevent spikes in hunger i get to the library and all set up by around     am  i spend a few minutes in prayer and meditation  followed by a        minute session in my journal the purpose of this journal session is get clarity and focus for my day  i write down my big picture goals and my objectives for that particular day  i then write down anything that comes to my mind  often  it relates to people i need to contact  or ideas related to a project i   m working on  i purposefully keep this journal session short and focused by       i   m set to work on whatever project i   m working on  whether that   s writing a book or an article  working on a research paper for my doctoral research  creating an online course  etc starting work this early may seem crazy to you  but i   ve been shocked by how easy it is to work for       hours straight without distractions  my mind is laser at this time of day  and i don   t rely on any stimulants at all between       am  my mind is ready for a break  so that   s when i do my workout  research confirms that you workout better with food in your system  consequently  my workouts are now a lot more productive and powerful than they were when i was exercising immediately following sleep after the workout  which is a great mental break  you should be fine to work a few more hours  if needed if your       hours before your workout were focused  you could probably be done for the day i understand that this schedule will not work for everyone  there are single parents with kids who simply can   t do something like this we all need to work within the constraints of our unique contexts  however  if you work best in the morning  you gotta find a way to make it happen  this may require waking up a few extra hours earlier than you   re used to and taking a nap during the afternoon or  it may require you to simply focus hardcore the moment you get to work  a common strategy for this is known as the                   rule  where you spend the first    minutes of your workday on your    priority  i   m certain this isn   t checking your email or social media whatever your situation  protect your mornings i   m blown away by how many people schedule things like meetings in the mornings  nothing could be worse for peak performance and creativity schedule all of your meetings for the afternoon  after lunch don   t check your social media or email until after your   hours of deep work  your morning time should be spent on output  not input if you don   t protect your mornings  a million different things will take up your time  other people will only respect you as much as you respect yourself protecting your mornings means you are literally unreachable during certain hours  only in case of serious emergency can you be summoned from your focus cave what you do outside work is just as significant for your work productivity as what you do while you   re working a march      study in the online issue of neurology found that regular exercise can slow brain aging by as much as    years  loads of other research has found that people who regularly exercise are more productive at work  your brain is  after all  part of your body  if your body is healthier  it makes sense that your brain would operate better if you want to operate at your highest level  you need to take a holistic approach to life  you are a system  when you change a part  you simultaneously change the whole  improve one area of your life  all other areas improve in a virtuous cycle consequently  the types of foods you eat  and when you eat them  determine your ability to focus at work  your ability to sleep well  by the way  it   s easy to sleep well when you get up early and work hard  is also essential to peak performance not only that  but lots of science has found play to be extremely important for productivity and creativity stuart brown  founder of the national institute for play  has studied the    play histories    of over six thousand people and concludes playing can radically improve everything         from personal well being to relationships to learning to an organization   s potential to innovate  as greg mckeown explains     very successful people see play as essential for creativity    in his ted talk  brown said     play leads to brain plasticity  adaptability  and creativity    nothing fires up the brain like play     there is a burgeoning body of literature highlighting the extensive cognitive and social benefits of play  including cognitsocialhaving a balanced life is key to peak performance  in the tao te ching  it explains that being too much yin or too much yang leads to extremes and being wasteful with your resources  like time   the goal is to be in the center  balanced in her book  on repeat  how music plays the mind  psychologist elizabeth hellmuth margulis explains why listening to music on repeat improves focus  when you   re listening to a song on repeat  you tend to dissolve into the song  which blocks out mind wandering  let your mind wander while you   re away from work   wordpress founder  matt mullenweg  listens to one single song on repeat to get into flow  so do authors ryan holiday and tim ferriss  and many others give it a try you can use this website to listen to youtube video
