silicon valley really isn   t a very fun place  and neither is stanford   and by that  i mean  it doesn   t see    fun    as a goal or holds it as a core value  the accompanying ideas of mirth  mischief  and playfulness is at best seen as things you do at burning man  and at worst  as childlike and distracting it   s very serious  even stodgy  and the majority of the products being built here is very serious  very serious  we will disrupt the world serious but this is not the popular view of silicon valley and the tech industry  and if i   m wrong or you disagree  i   d love to know where in the tech industry playfulness is a core value a great example of tech that is fun  playful and mischief is the swedish company teenage engineering  their products seem to start from a place of playfulness  take their pocket operator line of synthesizers  i own the po     and the user interface is a small factory with tractors and cranes making music  so fun  i can   t imagine teenage engineering being a silicon valley company  maaaaybe a san francisco company  maybe why are we so serious  and why is the public  and internal   perception so different  i have this hunch    the idea of the tech industry as this fun  buccaneering  pirate ship of counter culture forward thinking is  for the most part  just the afterglow of the   s and apple marketing campaigns i was having this conversation with a colleague  and his response was    but  dude  you have to be serious  else you   re just going to get killed by the competition    or perhaps you   ll be way ahead of the competition    interestingly enough  science and academia is also a very serious discipline  in contrast  though  this seriousness seems to come not from insecurity or competitiveness  but from the core principle that gives the scientific method its value  science is      factual  feynman   s famous quote comes to mind     the first principle is that you must not fool yourself     in science  we are very serious since we are very careful to not fool ourselves not all serious things are bad  but surely we can achieve our goals while we hold playfulness  fun  mischief  and mirth as core values in the tech industry or  in valley speak  we   re going to disrupt every line item in your company values statement  we   re going to ride this crazy train straight to the top shoutout  this post started as conversations with gleb denisov and james hegarty turn it up louder  i m a stanford ph d candidate in computer graphics focusing on autonomous drone cinematography
