yesterday penny kim  a startup marketing lead who moved from dallas to silicon valley to join what looked liked a high growth startup  the website has been taken down in the past couple of hours  wrote about her very negative experiences with the company  earlier today daniel tunkelang  a highly respected and very experienced data scientist  who was an adviser to the company also shared his experiences about working with the company  concluding    i should have gotten to know the company and its leadership better before associating myself with them and lending them my credibility    while at startupfactcheck we   ve focused on fact checking what companies put out into the world for investors  by doing ai ml nlp supported due diligence and providing deep insights to people who fund startups   from the very beginning we   ve known that there are other use cases for the models  workflows and technology we   re developing  potential candidates vetting the startups they work for is one of the major ones  after all  everyone who works for a startup is in a way an investor in that startup  ms  kim not only invested her time  hard work and reputation  but was on contract to receive further compensation in the form of equity  so what could have ms  kim done before she left her cat  said good by to her boyfriend and family and moved to live in an airbnb in california  of course i   m not saying she did anything wrong and i am in no way shaming the victim  but the truth is the bay area has always been about the gold rush and this time around is no different  halfway across the country  as the article points out she was looking out for red flags  which is a reactionary tactic  as opposed to doing her due diligence before taking the job  which possibly would have been more prudent and allowed her to walk away before any of this happened   as she wrote we certainly need better ways of differentiating between who to do business with than gut feel again  i am in no way implying ms  kim did anything wrong  i am saying that this situation  which is completely the fault of the founders  could have been avoided if the job candidate looked at a few key things and decided not to take the job these are some of the things that could be done in a similar situation and might constitute some best practices a  ask to speak to the current employees and at least   contractors and vendors  choose them yourself from a list provided by the startup or make your own list before you join a startup ask the founders for a list of all current employees and several former employees and choose a couple people to speak with  also  arrange to speak with at least   contractors working for the company and possibly some vendors  this cross section of people who have worked and currently work with the company will give you a good overview of how the company handles people and deals with different categories of relationships b  ask lots of open ended questions about the company   s financial standing in an ecosystem where   out of ten startups fail    out of    in an optimistic scenario  it   s important to know where your potential future employer is in the process if a startup you are working for promises to have   mm in funding it   s likely they have raised at least    mm    mm  which is a sizable a round in the current market  from this amount  assuming you know the burn rate  you can extrapolate the company   s runway and therefore know how long you have a chance of not being out of a job many startup fundings  especially in companies in which the founders like the limelight and like to name drop  as was the case here  are announced publicly in places like techcrunch  mashable and hackernews  so absence of mention in these publications is anothering thing to look out for c  take a call with one of the current investors and learn what her or his plans are for the company most experienced investors will tell you that hiring a level talent is one of the number one things they help their portfolio companies with and to that end they should be more than happy to spend some time with any prospective hires  especially senior level positions like in this case  board members will do this for sure  on the call ask about the financial situation  runway and the company   s abilities to raise more money d  ask to speak to a couple of people associated with the founders in their previous businesses  including employees  investors and vendors you can do this with the founders    permission or not  the goal is to see patterns emerge  of course if the founders don   t have good reputations from the past there might be a very good reason for that and you may or may not be inclined to consider why and how they   ve changed  but nonetheless it   s very good to know what happened so that you can be a more aware employee and team member  if you   re not offered a list by the founders that   s a strong indication that they might not be as transparent as you may like  you can find everyone you need using linkedin  crunchbase  angellist and   e  take a look at the founder   s social media footprint to determine who these people are connected to and see what sort of community you are buying into whether or not you buy into the    you are the average of the five people you surround yourself with    or not  it   s worthwhile to see what the founders    position is in the wider startup community  especially among tech leaders  investors and the press  some of the things to look out for are whether or not people are cheering them on and if they   re invited to actively participate in the community  speak at events  contribute to content  work on common projects  etc   f  spend a couple of hours with google  bing and duckduckgo  do boolean searches  scour twitter  facebook and quora  ask about the company a smart search strategy and some patience often leads to very interesting results  you can also be more proactive and ask questions on quora  stack overflow  twitter and other places if the above bring up red flags  as i believe it would in the case of ms  kim  it is worth digging a bit deeper g  ask to see the startup   s bookyou don   t have to see everything to understand where your next   paychecks are coming from  you need to see accounts receivables  cash in the bank  monthly spending and a couple of other key numbers  even if the startup finally decides to not disclose this information with you  that   s a data point right there in and of itself  buffer and others are already doing this as a default h  order a social media analysis of the foundtools like fama and others will give you a very comprehensive view of someone   s social media footprint and will give insights even complex searches can   t  including sentiment analysis   in this case one of the founders was trying to hide who he is on social media and that could have been discovered before joining the company i  ask the founders to undergo a background checkthis is more extreme but might be necessary if there   s already writing on the wall  tools like checkr are great for this  again  if the founders do not consent to this you   ve already learned something while i feel for ms  kim and the thousands of other people who have most certainly been subject to similar situations  it is clear that she felt this was a opportunity that seemed a little too good to be true  her words directly from the article   a couple of hours  in total  online and on the phone could have prevented this situation from every happening and as far as the platform the job ad was listed on  angellist  angel co   i wrote a post about the propensity for fraud in the startup space last year inspired by a deck that ceo and co founder naval ravikant presented himself   years ago that included  on one of the slides  the following statement     spectacular fraud will occur  in the startup space      and while of course angel co isn   t liable for what happened  assuming that    there   s no way a startup i found on angel co is going to screw me over  i thought    is no way to make your way through the startup world  it   s that sort of cognitive bias that pushes out critical thinking and makes it hard for us to see what   s real and what isn   t as the market is clearly going into a downturn  something we   ve been seeing in startup funding for the past   quarters and now in startup sales as well  more and more bad players will appear  in some cases these are people who have no business running companies and who   s grave mistakes and misconduct was covered up by the upswing of the past several years  in other cases a harder business environment leads some to cutting corners  bad decisions and desperate measures  whatever the reason behind bad behavior  employees  investors and vendors need to protect themselves if you   ve found this article to be of value feel free to
