tonight  i   m working from the penn station starbucks  after some time  my laptop   s battery needed power  so i walked over to where a fellow patron was seated  said    excuse me     and plugged in my charger i wasn   t sure what i did to merit this  but this particular patron proceeded to mutter expletives and mock my appearance audibly loud enough to decipher his words  my beard  my hair  my clothes  umm  okay he then assumed i   m muslim  surprise  surprise  he asked if i am muslim  to which i instantly replied    yes     force of habit  he then began a half hour rant  filled with expletives and threatening gestures his specific bone to pick  the mistaken notion that all muslim men  in his words     fuck seven women     shit  i should be so lucky  he then focused on my friend katherine  who   s been here this whole time i   m trying to work  by which i mean manage my mentions on twitter  and this guy   s getting close enough for the born and raised new yorker in me to simply no longer afford the luxury of ignoring his insanity he asked katherine a flurry of questions  by which i mean hurled insults and bigoted assumptions about islam  i asked him if we had met  he ignored me  then he asked me if i had seven wives  lol i told him  that   s not the case  nor is that allowed in my faith  i tried to clarify and drop some knowledge of elementary orthodox islamic jurisprudence  but he kept shouting    seven women  it   s degrading    buddy  the grimy particulate chaos that constitutes your pathetic existence is degrading  the look you   re going for  that of a poor man   s mickey avalon  is degrading  your intoxicated state is degrading anyway  the bemused  jaded starbucks staff eventually realized the usual volume of bullshit had been replaced by high octane horse shit  and decided to intervene  they asked him to leave  finally    i   m having a conversation     he shouted at them  at this point  every patron and several onlookers outside are staring  some recording this incident for posterity  this might end up on worldstar   but i   ll settle for your snapchat story  the police arrived shortly thereafter  and tried talking sense into him  a fool   s errand  and eventually dragged him out  i couldn   t help the intrusive thoughtstorm after   i   m not ugly  my beard is not unkempt  my hair is fucking fabulous  you should see my regimen  maybe it   s the longterm effects of antidepressant medication  maybe it   s my worldview  maybe it   s my hustle   but i found this experience hilarious  of course  that   s because i   m physically unharmed  dripping with privilege not afforded to my hijabi and niqabi sisters  more easily identifiable and therefore vulnerable   but what does this mean  i fear for the next time  when it   s not a raving drunk but a locked and loaded hater with too many bullets  too few scruples and a lot of misunderstanding and appetite for my blood   i fear for my mother and sister  i fear for my nephews  i fear for my friends  i fear for my community  this is obviously not okay  there   s so much to unpack here  and i   m still choosing to laugh instead of cry   okay  that   s again because of the antidepressant  i can   t cry  but that   s beside the point  i spoke with the police officers who detained the gentleman  and will follow up with wherever these cases go to die if you were looking for some feel good new year   s lesson in all this  there   s no silver lining  so scroll elsewhere  i   m no hero  neither am i a victim  i   m living my life unapologetically as i always have and will sorry i   m not sorry  if there   s anything i gleaned from this experience  it   s that i look muslim  which means my faith has been racialized  which means every islamophobe can shut the fuck up that it   s not also  i want seven girlfriends  one for each day of the week  oh  that   s the testosterone  not islam  speaking  see what i mean  religion  texts  even human beings aren   t inherently good or bad among many other things  i   m a marketer  as they say in my industry  content is king  but context is god  it   s all contextual  let me place myself in his shoes  i could make seventy excuses for him   maybe he wasn   t loved as a child  maybe he   s not a hugger  maybe nobody kissed him as the confetti cleared after midnight on new year   s  who even knows  i know that i don   t know anything know what   s funny  i don   t even drink starbucks coffee  i prefer caffeine pills  i came here for the free wi fi  i   ll be    in exactly   months from today which means this all happened on my half birthday   it could have been worse  he could have been carrying a knife or gun  ever have an out of body experience where time slows down  everything seems realer  and you suddenly feel so mortal we take risks like this all the time  living is risky  but what are you gonna do  be afraid and not go outside  i tried that  it sucks more than the alternative  putting yourself out there and dealing with crap there   s going to be haters  there   s going to be unforeseen circumstances and coincidences and boos coming from the cheap seats  keep it moving  they don   t want you to win  word to dj khaled honest to god  there   s probably some evolutionary biology explanation for the idea of hypergamous genetic replication through sexual reproduction seeming so odious an idea to the    civilized      but don   t get me started on the    civilized     james baldwin did a much better job describing it than you and i ever will     the    civilized    have created the wretched  quite coldly and deliberately   and do not intend to change the status quo  are responsible for their slaughter and enslavement  rain down bombs on defenseless children whenever and wherever they decide that their    vital interests      are menaced  and think nothing of torturing a man to death  these people are not to be taken seriously when they speak of the    sanctity    of human life  or the conscience of civilized world    tl dr  we drop bombs on brown kids a world away to feel safer and sleep sounder at night  what does that have to do with this  what does polygyny have to do with productivity at starbucks you tell me  i   m told i   m a halfway decent writer  but i know i   m terrible at advice  philosophizing  and theorizing  so why bother  i   m trying to be more honest this year  again  i don   t know anything i   ve faced hate crimes since      happened    years ago  i tried to kill myself for the last time over two years ago  since then  i   ve recovered and found my voice  i live for telling stories  let   s grab coffee ceo perennial millennial  prnnlmllnnl  founder  efzy  author  brown grass  alum  stonybrooku  bsc mba mph   stuyvesanthigh
