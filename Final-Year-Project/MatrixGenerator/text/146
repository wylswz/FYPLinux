the pico s instruct manual none of which requir more than minut of attent at a time step clean step insert picopak and auto brew step ferment beer in keg step transfer beer to serv keg and carbon colleagu watch my offic kitchenett oper plead for my brew but i kept them at bay i d invit seth mansergh presid of the san francisco homebrew guild over to tast test my first keg a session ipa dub half squeez i wa so confid i went to the store and bought a similar beer so we could do it a a blind tast test that wouldn t be necessari when i pull mr mansergh a fresh pint what came out look like lemonad well i made a veri light beer i said mr mansergh laugh nervous he went in for a sniff you get that rotten egg he said then he took the world s tiniest sip are you sure that s beer he ask there display almost no malt characterist or bodi at all the veri first brew usual is horribl but i ve never seen anybodi make one thi bad he said i had to agre all the gadgetri involv made a post mortem remark easi after eye the minut by minut log of what happen to my pre ferment concoct mr mansergh quickli diagnos the problem it got too hot to releas the sugar that feed the yeast instead of beer i made diet yeast juic the whole point of pico is that it manag brew temperatur so i sent the chart to compani chief execut bill mitchel a former microsoft exec he d never seen anyth like it he said after studi the log hi team surmis that i hadn t properli lock the keg connector which somehow caus the temperatur to rise o k but shouldn t such a smart machin notic someth awri it will now mr mitchel promis after my faulti batch picobrew updat it softwar to flag elev temperatur like thi our grand goal is to allow anyon at all to brew flawlessli regardless of experi level and we need to cover everi possibl fault case perfectli he said you re welcom chalk that one up to a combin of bad luck beginn ignor and an instruct manual that could use a littl more detail they ve sinc improv the manual on to brew no a dark stout call buffalo sweat which should be far more delici than it sound thi time the brew work a expect after ferment i pour my brew for mr mansergh he immedi congratul me on the color a rich brown it wa more beer like but upon first sniff he notic a problem a distinct wet gym sock after one tast he pick up some nice flavor but also a not so nice appl peel finish if my first brew score a out of mr mansergh would piti me on my second with a i crack open a can of real tallgrass buffalo sweat for comparison and mine wa like a cheap knockoff that had gone stale mr mansergh surmis my problem wa bad ferment the pico kit offer you two way to produc the alcohol in beer and i chose the slower tradit method for my stout but yeast in thi method prefer temperatur in the mid s and my ferment had taken place dure a rare san francisco heat wave where even my offic build bake for my third and final brew i went straight for the top pliniu maximu an homag to one of the bay area s most renown brew russian river brew co s plini the elder i brew my beer accord to instruct and in search of a yeast pleas environ i stash it insid a comput server closet temperatur a constant degre a littl over a week later mr mansergh wa brave enough to come back my beer wasn t particularli clear but had a pleas rich orang tone there wa no egg or gym sock smell thi is a lot better said mr mansergh thi time actual drink my beer but there s still a lot to go what wa hold me back he said wa time my beer still had a littl way to go befor it wa done ferment in thi case i had use picobrew s fast ferment system so keep it cool actual backfir mr mitchel said i should have done my third batch at the higher room temperatur so mani rule even with a robot helper i went off the
