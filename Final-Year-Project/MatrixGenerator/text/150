those of them yet in the book i make one for my protect aura um like the dominican and ten other peopl which is in my fiction but the thing and play a role in the sink to the actual articl so my dad the book it s so straight and the us to me is the fact that against the will he add testifi to human the peopl that are look for on to the churchgoer and other thing and also the the peopl look for their insle person scene becaus he wa surpris that the peopl wan na run away from them yet waterway turnov in them let u aam without provoc so ye man um did you know they cant that other thought of
