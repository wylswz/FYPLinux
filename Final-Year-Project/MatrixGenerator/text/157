marketing strategy may be a slight overstatement  which is why i am using quotation marks  nevertheless  this story is about how i got       downloads of my app with a snickers bar i have been using the university of costa rica  ucr  internal bus system for a while now  along with thousands of other students  and most of us do not know the bus schedule  the only ones who know it are the clever ones who took a picture of the schedule that   s posted at the bus stops frankly  i was too lazy to always be searching through all the files in my phone  including the countless photos that people send to whatsapp groups  it   s not a difficult task  but perhaps the modern world has spoiled us with a desire for simpler and more efficient solutions in one of those moments when i was too lazy to figure out what time the bus left  i realized that when i got home  i could turn on the computer  grab those times  write them into an app and upload it on google play so people could use it in the modern world  we are unaccustomed to situations which involve tedious tasks  or perhaps we are so used to them that we do not perceive them  so every time you notice a moment like that  stop what you are doing  analyze the situation  because you have just found a    pain    that perhaps thousands of people like you suffer every day and thanks to that    pain     you may have an opportunity to create a simpler  more efficient solution that solves the problem returning to the main topic  i went home and made the app called cazadora ucr  it means old bus in spanish   i just thought about it for two nights and presto  i had an app  it was very simple and basically did nothing  it just displayed the times  but that was all that it needed to do  when i finished it  i was going to upload it to the play store  but i could not do so because i had to pay     to google  which i did not have at that moment     and here is where the title of the post comes in   we already had the app  and now we needed people to know it existed  so i wrote a post on facebook that said that among those who shared the post  i was going to raffle off a snickers bar i shared the post in all the ucr facebook groups and the response and numbers obtained were unbelievable and all this with a simple snickers bar  no paid advertising on facebook  all this for the price of      sometimes we think things through deeply and that   s good  but we learn a lot more by executing our ideas rather than simply thinking about them  many solutions can be implemented and then improved  i   m not saying that everything should be executed this way  but with some things we can experiment and learn lots along the way i leave you with the phrase of the month gary vaynerchuk  ceo   founder vaynermediathis post was originally posted in spanish with the name un snickers como    estrategia de marketing    and translated with the help of david grillot if you liked this story please click on the green heart and if you want to ask me something  please write to me at  email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script   e t length e    if t e  getattribute  data cfhash   return t e     if t   c t previoussibling   p t parentnode if a c getattribute  data cfemail    for e    r   x  a substr        n   a length n n    e              x  a substr n    r  tostring      slice     p replacechild document createtextnode decodeuricomponent e   c  p removechild t   catch u               wantrepreneur trying to stop just wanting and start being  i hope to change this bio soon  posts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
