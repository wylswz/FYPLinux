 this was originally posted in my huffington post column here  starting a startup is hard  but scaling it is even harder  this was the big realization i had when my startup organization youthhack was facing growing pains as we started to expand our programs all over the world  i   m thankful to have gotten the opportunity to learn how a company scales through my    week summer internship at uber philippines coming into the internship  i wasn   t sure what to expect as an intern in the city operations team  i figured that i would be using previous skills that i already had in marketing  content  sales and business development however  i quickly found out on my first day that i was on the strategic analytics team and that i would be doing analytics using excel and the statistical programming language called r  which i had to learn during my first week while working on my first project the struggle was real but with the help of my managers  a lot of googling  and a lot of time spent watching tutorials  i was eventually able to get the hang of using r  doing statistical analysis with excel and automating my r scripts using the web framework called shiny    build something users want     is a famous quote that silicon valley startup accelerator y combinator likes to preach  it was at uber where i got to see this motto practiced day in and day out uber truly makes it an effort to listen to both its partner drivers and its riders  i still remember all the surveys i had to send to gather information about our users  all the support tickets we had to answer  feedback and comments we had to process  and thousands of data points i had to analyze with the goal of making sure users of uber have the best experience when you   re working in a company that serves thousands if not millions of people each day  every single detail is extremely important  one of the early lessons my manager imparted to me was how to not only double check my work but also triple check it hand in hand  it   s amazing to see how one small feature  implementation  email or detail can make such a big difference in how a city moves  one of my proudest moments was improving the pickup view of the app for one of manila   s biggest malls megamall  and then seeing tweets of riders talk about how it helped them get picked up faster not being the best at quantitative skills or the biggest fan of my statistics class back in college  i wasn   t really the best in crunching numbers  however  interning at uber showed me the importance of numbers and always backing up every assumption and every idea i had with numbers whether it was collecting data to validate potential projects or testing for the statistical significance of certain features i had rolled out  i got to see how data is used to measure the impact of projects and in making strategic decisions  suddenly  i had a newfound appreciation for numbers throughout my internship  i tried to soak in as many lessons as i could learn about how a company scales  looking back at all the notes i took down in my evernote notebook  this was the one lesson that kept popping up         process is extremely important whether it was writing reports for the rest of the team to know what i was doing or updating my managers on the status of my projects or creating playbooks on best practices and lessons learned from the projects i worked on  it was evident how much uber cared about creating processes in order to keep things sustainable and scalable with one week left in my internship  i remember that one message the general manager had sent on our interns group asking if someone wanted to help him build an application to streamline one of our processes  he was looking for someone  who could    sprint on it for the next three days    while i didn   t have any background on the app creator and scripting language he wanted to use  after viewing a quick tutorial and going through the specifications with the general manager and realizing the importance of what he wanted me to build  i decided to give it a shot although the project turned into a   week long project that had me coming in to work even after my official internship end date  i finished up the project knowing that the application i had built would be used by thousands of people in the philippines i ended my internship at uber not only developing new skills and learning how a company scales but also becoming best of friends with    other co interns  in over two months spent interning together  we got to see each other struggle through different challenges  work on real projects  and celebrate small wins and big wins we   d stay in the office until  pm    pm  and sometimes even past   pm finishing up our projects and exchanging stories about life  we simply weren   t just co interns anymore  we were a family making magic happen  and witnessing how uber has impacted our country and the lives of filipinos at an unprecedented rate as i headed home on my very last day  it was clear to me what the most important thing is when it comes to scaling a company  it   s all about the people special thanks to my co interns for all the  mems  the full time employees for all the lessons and kwento sessions  and of course  my strategic analytics managers for believing in me  giving me the opportunity to take on real projects and for being ever so supportive throughout my    week internship you can learn more about my uber internship experience in this website i built  for students who
