anoth dish potomac watch with joe radio here in york i he join joe the ball and the tanker with thi is well here with him and down in washington kim straw soul we can see your to weaken here i can in march ok so we re go to talk a littl bit about the about the big news of obamacar which is come close to select in the futur twenti five percent increas averag increas in premium across countri for twenti seventeen among other issu how is thi gon na play the next two week last coupl of about the latest fbi news regard the cotton e mail investig and i m down trump who ha a offer a contract with america but it took awhil to get there on saturday without the deliveri of the agenda so let s start to can muster with the fbi investig which is interest in the journal broke the stori on monday about to the number two person at the fbi who led the investig is whi joe mccabe have now add money thrown in her campaign which are in for the state senat in virginia by clinton and a longtim pal of terri mcauliff now governor of virginia yet the eia is again a hot see here becaus the real stori is that terri mcauliff had a polit action committe call come to the da he also in essenc becaus he s governor of the state run the virginia democrat parti combin the two entiti to be close to six hundr seventi five thousand dollar to you or her state senat campaign and at the time her husband and hurrican wa aam at the time she announc he wa from the washington field offic and thi wa around the same time we first heard news that hillari clinton have privat server not long after the fbi investig began in juli he move out to the number three slot and he wa in that posit when she wa receiv all of thi money for her state senat campaign that there is obvious a question here conflict of interest is clear appear of a conflict of interest is no question about the whether or not there s a real conflict of interest is against the pen would depend on further investig guy i mean thi just strike me a you you jim conley the director of the fbi the the the note boy scout or at least that s the way he view himself eliot ness you know the man who is of all your your foot is secular it ha a keogh jetstream sainthood is just around the corner i d i d take your point trail but then index now he is portray in medium thi is he s thi is a self definit abov ani kind of polit pain and yet thi is thi join the list now of of of reason to suspect that thi wa a fair fbi probe call me i don t care what anyon say thi is just the appear of conflict of interest is extraordinari and the fbi to ensur gear up you know by the time he would get the e when he had actual oversight over decad hi wife s campaign wa done and by that we carri a cop wa the subject of our investig will even with the trainer know that he is at the concert at the clayton famili isn t thi out there start to question one also under investig and sold for campaign financ violat true true well you know back in the reagan year when they use to rais conflict of interest question about the member of hi ministr the famou phrase the appear of appear and the insinu wa that it even look bad like thi on wa suppos to be someth that that no seriou public figur of appoint or otherwis would would wan na get involv in an we re talk about the feder bureau of investig and the news a meteor such these day that more and more peopl get access to the store is one way or anoth they all find out if we re almost back to the begin of their investig of calor climb their servic tap on the wrist interview with her late on friday even the saturn sap saturday the last stand and now all thi for you have the number three down the number two other offici in the fbi it with a wife who is run for offic in who announc her candidaci the same month hillari clinton gave her press up for a news confer on the email server what is the averag american now they re suppos to think of their fbi they do look like they re compromis is the job of the director to make sure that sort of thing doesn t happen to an american institut me and i think that thi issu is not go to go away too much and assum hillari clinton win in the republican hold the hous end republican will hold hear in the hous on the investig he still have an investig into the investig of that investig is of of of jame conni s khan got to hear and how the fbi didn t i think phil rowlandson fbi agent and mayb put him under oath and say so when you think of of of of the process that wa pursu him and how it and how it went ahead i think jame call me is is direct thi done real damag to the reput of the a b i mean i i think you re right there s there s gon na be all kind of hear the ghanaian subpoena the fbi email about the email they presum will not have the luxuri of delet them for their turnov to congression investig like secretari prime time and yet i i think thi thi will continu to assum there is a second clinton presid thi thi will continu to dog them and i d i think you re right that the reput and the fbi ha ha realli been harm and all the irregular in thi case are are are go to be expos a the focu is go to chef from the claimant to the toth fbi in you know what all it whitewat all were to write thi the compromis of feder institut on behalf of the clinton legal problem and she isn t even presid yet and we re go to be go right back into the same environ that we were or were and preacher to oakland and the most the press will ignor it but we will not so let s talk about the obamacar the other big news to some big year on monday the we knew we saw thi come becaus the state insur had the insur compani in the state insur have been grant on individu i m realli increas and make decis on the insur propos but thi wa the feder govern say that the averag increas in premium across the countri joe correctli from wrong is to be about twenti five percent i d call that you re not wrong of but the depart of health and human servic a slice the data in a way that make it look better than in actual it s so what they report yesterday after close of busi of cours wa it that the averag increas for what s in the second lowest cost silver plan on the exchang thi now thi is an import benchmark for send the subsidi aam but what they re realli report is that the them stabl the second best perform plan the averag in all the state so in the few state that have more than two insur now there s a lot of plant that are a lot higher than twenti five percent so it s it s realli a big increas the on the same actor flashier wa to a seven percent so that thi is realli a sign that the bill wa problem are acceler and at a point where it is becom a lot harder to fix that s fascin and i mean it s depress a a matter of public polici becaus thi wa suppos to be lean toward cheaper realli lor caus health care instead we re see these increas and were see those come along with reduc network of provid that s hospit and doctor who often can t go to the doctor of your choic becaus it wa deni a part of the insur network your and you re also see fewer insur offer may be in mani of the state would is about twenti five percent of all american counti have onli one obamacar provid on the exchang at the combin even be higher than what we are realli say is health insur did did you still look like what peopl get through their job due to employ sponsor insur turn more into medicaid ansari the youth you realli have peopl been come into sub standard care that is nonetheless extrem expens the the the the the the polit fall out of thi is go to be interest on the cri of the pre obama gave a speech last week say kind of a victori lap say don t believ all the critic and say donna miami say with and they re they re all polit motiv probabl knew these number are come show and said mm probabl tri to get a hair out ahead of them and i think that to the that the consequ of thi e if if if trump or so far behind is someth that i think a lot of order we care deepli about the trumpet made ani effort across the campaign actual explain thi and drive thi a an issu he would be abl to make you better use of it and i think you will the question is can senat race senat republican senat made it to make use of thi i mean i d i think the minist to human safeti he doesn t talk about polici all we would of had to do on danc talk about these these failur there were see and say what congression republican have a plan to deal with thi it s got a better way i m not i m not a polici expert but they are and they ve got a solut an omin sign into law he didn t do that the key here we are so fine but if you if you look at especi in the senat a lot a lot of these the biggest increas are in state with competit center is like arizona where the increas next year is a hundr fifti percent your nostril to see that in in ani common market but but especi in health care or so peopl like john mccain to me in pennsylvania ron johnson of wisconsin they ve they ve got an issu they ve been run on mat and and mayb it will help drag them over the initi becaus their oppon have endors obamacar present a a great thing and got in a lot of case such a russ feingold or the sixtieth vote that said i had been by an indian into both of them provid the sixtieth vote becaus both of them were in the senat in two thousand and five and wa we just ate and did they both provid becaus of me pa by them there s a sixti vote threshold arriv and it s go to camp i feel we should interrupt thi broadcast group new switch it on track to stardom did discov obamacar he is ten hundr a two week storm about it all today about how premium are go to skyrocket are jump twenti five percent for hillari will make it wors wherev kiyoto graphic he s been treat everi few minut about it so we ll see if that translat into you a more sustain obamacar discuss thank for pray for waddl in on the issu here at the end the campaign nice to go up well i m it s not the worst enemi for u to read the wall street journal stori on thi and that is an absolut nightmar is go on with obama there are a dozen read the stori she read it i think peopl have been shuffl paper from it a suspect but other democrat word the democrat are vulner on thi issu thi is affect individu american out there with a no go through thi thi nightmarish roman period right now they could end up have their insur assign to them by the feder govern of peopl tri to call into the insur are still in the game are gon na run into these incred consum servic gridlock is the isth insur tri to deal with the mass and whi i think there s a real opportun for those senat candid so they re the one like ron johnson s show subtl alreadi do it to just ride thi against their democrat oppon are i were to take a break and we come back we ll talk a littl the more about the obamacar around in the campaign and our crop trial offer for a contract with america when we come veronica dagher you wan na know how the rich invest spend and protect their money and listen to the lott senior wealth podcast for more inform check thi out at the beest dot com slash podcast by thi on itun pictur and now spot wsj podcast within ambiti from the opinion page of the wall street journal thi is that um a lot now we are look down and calmli welcom back to impos ago here in new york with joe rego and dan henning and in virginia kim straw soul so um i want to just if due to close off thi obamacar discuss with a the littl bit of what might ve been i mean can you imagin how a potent thi issu credit and if you get a candid it couldn t down trumpet anybodi who decid for exampl make the centerpiec of hi elect campaign and made thi a part of the thi is the of thi campaign have the at the convent and drove a speech and put thi a a formal central part of thi have a stump speech say cure the problem with that you know thirti second sixti second around here so i m go to do i think is to be a veri potent issu in such a lost opportun with the trump campaign and the question is can know center race you talk about it and can elev thi enough in the final in the final two week to paid advertis car are not go get a heckuva lotta help from from the press corp in the state but they should be abl to elev it through paid me money they have two set of trump isn t go to handl the great ironi thi campaign is that start in earli septemb when donald trump did those teleprompt speech on tax energi health care and nation secur he came even with hillari clinton the poll democrat are of panic that he might win and then he complet of them bad approach and bring u to thi point with him on so far behind so the senat the senat the senat candid have him roll with thing like obamacar two of their campaign with thi stori come out like it is today should give them at least an a and even shot of a cure some of those race yet it is just a round out i mean it is veri win issu for republican in two thousand and two thousand fourteen but it s the the the parti still not run a credibl obamacar challeng a a presidenti candid mitt romney in two thousand call him a a prototyp for the law and in massachusett and now trump obvious ha is own issu but but realli a unmitig is that the presidenti level one it s it s realli too bad that also read the fed to imagin not just had a candid to explain it oh well that would mean up and down the ticket becaus the argument would then be in the need to let me a presid he need to let these senat and hous member to keep republican that we can chang it for better care but you have a whole packag for you and that the peopl at the poll and vote republican up and down the ticket and it wa interest thi weekend donald trump after sever week of sustain abus against mani republican in washington there is someon also put a newspap stori in front and end about thi is well and he suddenli start say you need to come out in a letter to all of u so that i can actual cut through the chang now propos which is the first time she s gon na stop anoth campaign revel from neutral cite the won alik peopl in your own parti to to washington to tell you thi is the stun news in the trunk of him the sarcasm okay so let let s talk about the contract with the with the with america the down from the propos on sadder day of the fifteen or so or wa a twenti five item is go to do i and the first one hundr day mani of them on the first day he didn t get there after seventeen minut of of of of those idea after seventi minut of of attack up on sundri well thi is a peac protest and say the contract issu beyond number one which wa sail all the woman but onc he got past batch of there were real item in there i mean the tax propos to be discuss in the again a per speech were pretti good morn to corpor rate to fifteen percent three of person bracket thi wa a campaign that thi wa an agenda of via march that he and the republican could have drawn aam for two month the past two month instead there s an old union bo my mom said it s a day late dollar short it s just a littl late in the game to be could propos a twenti five polici item for of the elector to absorb in the indic in everi way the trunk and i mean you you would normal lay thi out at the convent you would talk about a third septemb you would argu about it that the debat and then now you d be make a close argument and everybodi were to fall that s whi he s run that s what he want to do thi is whi i should vote for him and said the other guy for a woman and that that hasn t happen and and is just the the the structur failur of the term continu it s a basic knew that the averag voter you could call you would rememb everyth that you would put in hi or her mind him to three four thing soni alpha is contriv and that would stick with them in the poll and the contrast wa secretari clinton camp yet the classic tri to induc her to the deliveri of the index he got up there and read it and trade thi in that way you mention and connect it to a bigger campaign the mess while you chang or some other person by the way he s he s tri to do that thi suggest thing parti s leader in the system is rig against peopl in that mani of the thing he s propos are again about him work for the averag voter to have been hurt in washington to get thi beach instead of give claim that candi he can start stop the entir thing by talk bout how he intend to sue the email accus to come out against him and that thi will happen at some point stay tune all the headlin were about the fact that trump want to go in and see these woman rather than the speech he gave back and i know he just can t seem to help themselv at time so we re close year out we ve we would onli have one week what he think best to trump best reitman is close aam you know iron enough i think some of these thing but it s all ultim crook filigre a realli good the or the top i know i just mean the the the fact that you have to understand the crook realli broadli defin thi is the sort of administr and that the govern that peopl will be look at the elector reclin in the e mail server i think i ve remain are biggest holder of gold in fact she doe not have credibl a lot of peopl don t trust are mani voter do not want to cast their vote for and rather than just attack her and hominem the kit trump talk about the email surf talk about the fact that it s go to be the parti of elizabeth warren berni sander of you are the well for berni sander and by all mean vote for hillari clinton ha becom a govern are go to get some belt in peopl s mind about the viabil of clinton presid from it okay so i let s finish it the it the with that today thank to joe rego dan henning in contrast with that with anoth edit tomorrow potomac watch a thi the campaign head into it final two week two week to go boat two week from today if you haven t alreadi believ it or not to and will be back tomorrow thank for listen post ago wsj podcast listen
