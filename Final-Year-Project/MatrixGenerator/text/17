i have long been a fan of angellist  an innovative online platform for startup funding and recruiting  i have watched the rise of the platform with great interest and enjoyed playing with it around the edges over the last few years  individual angels and even some firms have used angellist to create investment clubs to invest in individual startups in what are known as syndicates  more recently  funds have used angellist to create special purposes vehicles  spvs  for follow on investments in portfolio companies my flybridge partners and i decided we would try a new twist on the model by creating a small fund on angellist as a platform to make seed investments centered around a particular community and theme  to that end  a few months ago  we created something we call the graduate syndicate fund  a      million seed fund  bostinno wrote a bit about it here the graduate syndicate will invest          in compelling startups founded by recent harvard graduates  particularly out of harvard business school  hbs   as a faculty member in the entrepreneurship department over the last six years  i have had the opportunity to teach hundreds of brilliant  enterprising students  flybridge has invested in a few of them  but many of the recent graduates  and only graduates  in compliance with harvard   s conflict of interest policy  are at such an early stage         pre seed or seed         that they are pre institutional at the time that i am advising them  as with our other investments  our goal is to back outstanding entrepreneurs who are pursuing large  disruptive opportunities that we think can generate outstanding returns  but by operating more like an angel         we don   t price the deals or take board seats  we don   t require partner meetings but instead make decisions after a few meetings given we already know these entrepreneurs well         we can be more flexible with regard to process  stage  sector and geography the other thing we decided to do in creating the fund is to invite some of our friends to invest alongside us who are from the harvard community  so  in addition to flybridge iv  our fourth fund  which we are currently investing out of   the lps in the graduate syndicate are a handful of hbs professors and alumni who are excited to support the young entrepreneurs  many of whom they had in their classes or have been advising as entrepreneurs in residence  eirs   we also assembled a group of recent alumni entrepreneurs as advisors to be available to coach the founders through the ups and downs  particularly in the early years before they have more formal advisors or boards the benefits of the graduate syndicate to entrepreneurs are compelling  pre seed money from a trusted advisor  a network of amazing lps and experienced entrepreneurs available to them  and inclusion in the broader flybridge network of nearly     portfolio companies  since creating the graduate syndicate a few months ago  we have made eight investments  amartha  baroo  camino financial  digital outposts  fitzroy toys  funding societies  getaway and robin health  the website lists them all  but the plan is to run the experiment for the next year or two and then assess the results having created this new model on angellist  i thought i would share a few observations as a venture capitalist working with the platform all in all  creating a fund on angellist has been a very positive experience  if anyone would like to learn more from our experience  let me know former entrepreneur turned vc at flybridge capital  hbs senior lecturer  author of mastering the vc gam
