while no one really believes that uber is protecting drivers from    racist tipping practices     the company   s true motives are somewhat curious  going back to a      vanity fair profile on founder travis kalanick  uber co founder garrett camp explained that     after entering credit card information on the app  anyone could summon a car with the press of a button  g p s  took care of the location  and the cost was automatically charged to the customer   s account  with tipping already figured in    until the class action lawsuits  and uber   s medium post from april     this was the common belief         that the tip was already included in the price of the ride  having their bluff called in court  uber changed their tune  but why  could it be that by extending their commission to the    tip    portion of the price  uber would be in clear violation of federal labor law  perhaps  true or not  however  why continue with further obfuscation it would appear that ms  smiley has hit the nail on the head  that uber is more interested in    protecting cheapskates    through a    seamless  read tipless  transaction     than concerned about the well being of their drivers  in a symbiotic business model such as uber   s  where the passenger cannot exist in the absence of the driver  uber   s refusal to include a tipping option appears to be a thinly veiled and shortsighted strategy  one that is more demonstrative of classism  than of ridding the world of racial bias we   ve been on this shift too long
