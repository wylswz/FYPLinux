the place to be if you want to think long and hard about america   s history and be aggressively patriotic       marked the nation   s bicentennial  and states had parades  celebrations and the most intense independence day barbecues that history had ever seen  july  th       was a day for extreme patriotism  a few weeks later  philly was still abuzz with red  white and blue         and the american legion  an association of over   million veterans  held its annual conference at the bellevue stratford hotel           legionnaires     as they   re called  to celebrate the    th anniversary of the declaration of independence the convention ran from july   st to july   th ray brennan was the legion   s bookkeeper and an air force vet  at     the whirlwind of the three day convention had worn him out and when he returned home on the evening of the   th  he noted to his family that he was feeling run down  so  when he died on the   th of an apparent heart attack  his earlier noted fatigue was seen as merely prodromal to whatever major cardiac event had been brewing  as his family mourned  another legionnaire  frank aveni  also died of a supposed heart attack  by the first of august  six more legionnaires who had attended the convention in philly were dead of apparent cardiac events dr  ernest campbell  a physician in bloomberg  pa  treated a few of the first legionnaires to die  he quickly realized that they had all recently attended the conference  and he immediately notified the department of public health within the first week after the conference      of the attendees ended up in the hospital  and    were dead      had been a busy year for the center for disease control  cdc   at the beginning of the decade they had changed their name from the communicable disease center to the center for disease control and prevention  seen the last reported case of smallpox and  although they didn   t yet know it  had identified the culprit behind the legionnaire   s deaths as summer turned to fall  the epidemiologists charged with figuring out what was making the legionnaires sick were themselves the victims of a different kind of outbreak  mass hysteria  the public  once they got wind of the cluster of legionnaire deaths  almost immediately presumed it to be swine flu  the nation had reason to assume this  in february of that year  there had already been an outbreak at fort dix  immunizations for the public showed up within the first month after the outbreak  but when three elderly patients died after receiving it  the public grew suspicious         even though there was absolutely no proof that the vaccines had lead to the patient   s deaths  the mass panic had shifted from the flu itself to the vaccinations         and so  in the autumn of       when the legionnaires became sick and many died  the largely unvaccinated public began to wonder if the outbreak had merely laid dormant throughout the summer and was now returning with a vengeance the investigation wore on for months  well into the winter of      and early       the cdc laboratory scientists and field epidemiologists were at a major disadvantage when it came to real time communication  they simply didn   t have the technology  in modern times  ongoing outbreak investigations have the luxury of being aided by the internet  cell phones and video conferencing  the field scientists are never out of communication with the lab  and they can adjust their interviews and research with patients according to what is being discovered by those looking at samples under a microscope  in       however  this wasn   t yet the case  so the long slog of the investigation continued into the following year the scientists had  almost a year earlier  investigated an outbreak of a respiratory virus in pontiac  michigan  which they were finding was similar to the illness reported by the legionnaires and their families  though  while pontiac fever had been  at worst  a mild and self limiting respiratory virus  whatever was killing the legionnaire   s was far more insidious  the men had severe respiratory symptoms  almost immediately developed pneumonia and had fevers that ran as high as     degrees fahrenheit       degrees celsius   with little else to go on  and more deaths being reported  the public and the media grew increasingly unnerved by    legionnaire   s disease    and began prepping for an epidemic  michael crichton   s the andromeda strain had hit theaters at the beginning of the decade and so  perhaps  the american public was a little heightened to the possibility  maybe it seemed a little bit too dramatic that  just weeks after the bicentennial  dozens of america   s veterans had suddenly dropped dead from some mysterious illness that they had contracted while celebrating in the birthplace of the nation even without the heat from the public  the cdc had enough reason to be concerned that perhaps they could have their own andromeda strain on their hands  they were having a hard time assessing the health and wellbeing of the other convention attendees and their families  and they began to fear that the infectious agent had spread out of the hotel  which had closed down  and into the streets of philadelphia  the cdc responded by launching the largest infectious disease investigation in the agency   s history the investigation held the media   s attention for months and between the public   s fear mongering and the work of several fearless journalists  the media probed the federal government to be accountable for the truth         was the public in danger  what had killed the veterans  and what were they doing to try to solve the mystery  as the investigation continued  the media documented the scientists in an unprecedented manner  bringing medical technology into the homes of the american public  investigators reviewed medical records  interviewed survivors and their families  and tracked down as many of the attendees as they could  bellevue stratford hotel closed down temporarily so that it could be throughly investigated  one patient interviewed  a man named thomas payne  was hospitalized with a fever that spiked to     degrees fahrenheit       celsius   his account of the onset of the illness helped epidemiologists further narrow down the possible cause  he also gave them leads on other possible patients who could  perhaps  be of help the first results to come back from the lab definitively assured the public that no influenza of any kind was the cause of the outbreak  they had also ruled out heavy metal poisoning and other toxins with preliminary tests that had been run months before  pretty soon the cdc just shrugged their collective shoulders and figured the world would probably never know what caused legionnaire   s disease then  one epidemiologist  a man named joseph mcdade  got really pissed off at the company christmas party when he was directly criticized for not solving the outbreak  he put down his drink and went back to the lab it took him another month  but in january of      mcdade successfully isolated the bacterium responsible for the outbreak and he named it legionella pneumophila  in fact  the bacterium had been identified before         several times  but science had largely held the belief that it only affected animals  so it had not been looked at before in the cdc   s investigations as a viable cause of the outbreak  the fever in pontiac  michigan a few years prior had  in fact  also been caused by the same bacterium         but it only resulted in a far milder strain of the disease  both begin with flu like symptoms and appear similar to a run of the mill respiratory virus  but legionnaire   s routinely led to pneumonia and high fevers that quickly progressed to fatal bradycardia  slow heart rate   subsequent research concluded that the bacterium had been in the vents of the bellevue stratford hotel and had  therefore  been pumped through those air vents and then inhaled by attendees  continued research would also find it to thrive in hot tubs  humidifiers and nebulizers  the prognosis was actually quite good  it could be treated successfully with specific antibiotics  antibiotics that weren   t the first line of defense by the hospitals that treated the first cases in summer of       once the pathogen had been identified and the mystery put to rest  the cdc was suddenly forced to question some of its investigative practices  likewise  the public no longer felt confident blindly putting their faith in the federal government to protect them from outbreaks         and both of these facts led to a reform in epidemiological standards that properly braced america for subsequent outbreaks         anthrax  hiv aids and h n   the cdc also developed  out of necessity  a somewhat improved relationship to the public and the media  which created a sense of accountability to the public throughout the investigations which we still see in our newspaper headlines and news tickers today legionnaire   s disease has  since       had at least three more major outbreaks worldwide  unlike some outbreaks  legionnaire   s tends to stay in small clusters  so it has been able to be contained as soon as it is identified  the cdc has formerly reported that as many as        hospitalizations in the us annually are a result of legionnaire   s disease  but that many cases are likely to go unreported  largely because the symptoms are extremely similar to influenza and pneumonia always
