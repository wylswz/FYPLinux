anxieti iphon you ve heard the bad news appl remov the headphon jack from the new iphon here s the good news they fill that space with preciou life sustain batteri and other practic stuff appl s iphon and iphon plu aren t the holograph teleport hoverphon of my dream but they fix much of what ha long ail the iphon and that s reason enough to get over the headphon thing and upgrad think of it a the anti anxieti iphon ponder for a moment the mani way appl ha elev global blood pressur over the past decad we beg borrow and steal charger for our deplet iphon there s terror in get these delic rectangl anywher near water and we tap tap tap in vain at the camera tri to get a nighttim shot that doesn t make our child look like sasquatch over the past five day i have squeez an hour and more batteri life out of the and plu in brutal test i drop an iphon in a pond and it surviv and i ve manag to snap more than a few after sunset photo i m actual proud of that s how i spell relief but i still won t call it the most advanc phone money can buy these benefit would make the iphon the best smartphon of last year is when appl should have put it on sale now appl s just play catch up to samsung ssnhz which ad an equival camera and waterproof to it galaxi s six month ago it s dumb luck for appl that the iphon is arriv friday just a samsung face a bruis recal on the galaxi note which would otherwis be the simon bile of smartphon i still think android user should look to samsung for an upgrad just wait until the batteri issu is fix appl train u to think that everi two year we d be dazzl by a whole new shebang yet two year after the iphon it is hard to spot much extern that is differ about the iphon save the new glossi black finish with a diabol abil to retain fingerprint serious appl design do you all wear glove but appl offer plenti of reason to retain our loyalti it s improv featur that actual matter it provid unriv retail and custom servic it io remain the most eleg mobil softwar and the new version io continu to prove we don t have to cede the privaci of our email photo and to do list just to get help new capabl so let s talk about the other reason you might actual consid skip the iphon the death of the headphon jack appl realli blew it when it explain thi the iphon still come with cord earbud but they plug into the lightn port now instead of the old round plug and the box come with an adapt so you can use your old headphon there s one big downsid you can t plug in headphon and the charger at the same time unless you buy anoth strang adapt for while all that is annoy it s actual a good time to consid wireless headphon whose tech ha leapt forward recent in octob appl will begin sell it own airpod wireless headphon that look like a cross between ear and electr toothbrush head they are one more thing to worri about charg and small enough that i could imagin lose them but i enjoy use a preproduct version on a plane and in the offic see my deeper dive on the airpod here so whi is it worth lose the jack appl s explan that it had the courag to move audio tech forward ha gone over like a lead balloon instead of pat themselv on the back appl s brass should have stuck to the main messag it freed up a ton of space insid a phone that s alreadi more pack than a subway car to do more practic thing we realli want batteri appl manag to improv perform without chang the size of the phone the batteri capac is larger in the and larger in the plu versu last year s model and appl s new processor while faster know how to turn off portion that aren t in use to save power in my punish lab test the iphon last and hour the plu which ha a bigger batteri but also a bigger screen to light last about hour both of these were about an hour and longer than a fresh iphon s and s plu and two and hour longer than a s that ha been in use for a year bear in mind that in regular use the plu model alway last longer than it smaller sibl while that s still true the smaller got a bigger boost thi time and will get more peopl through the day if you hammer your iphon with intens app you may still need a hideou batteri backpack water resist appl ha final own up to an unfortun realiti a lot of u drop our phone into swim pool hot tub and ye toilet in our test the newli seal up iphon surviv a half hour in a fish tank a duck pond dunk even an hour and in and out of a pool but i can t recommend you take it swim appl promis onli that it phone can live for up to minut under a meter of water and the regular one year hardwar warranti won t actual cover water damag import if it doe get wet let it dri out for at least five hour befor charg camera if you long ago ditch your digit camera for an iphon i ve got good news the biggest improv in the iphon is it abil to take pictur in low light it ha a new sensor wider apertur len and optic imag stabil on both model one of the most dramat exampl from my test is a photo i took of my buddi nate in a dim bar in the s shot you can hardli make out hi featur the show him smile and rais a toast compar with the excel camera in the samsung galaxi s and note i d say it s about a draw in a night shot i took of radio citi music hall with both the galaxi s edg and iphon you can see that the galaxi handl the dynam rang better but add more nois while the iphon overexpos by hold the shutter open a hair too long the iphon plu ha a larger screen and batteri and two camera on the back one for wide shot the other with a x len it wa nice to use when i couldn t quit get close enough to my subject though a cheap point n shoot would be abl to zoom in much much more photo buff are more excit about how that second len can help creat a background blur effect in shot by captur some depth inform unfortun that wasn t readi for me to test appl say it will come by the end of the year speaker appl squeez stereo speaker into the phone doubl the volum it can crank out that ha been remark help for confer call even though call qualiti is about the same watch video in bed and listen to podcast while in the shower am i the onli one who doe that not all iphon improv are quit a big a appl want u to think it s great that they doubl storag that come on each phone but it s still highway robberi that appl make u pay it for the storag instead of let u stick in our own microsd card the home button isn t actual a button ani more it s a bit of the screen that just jiggl a littl when you touch it known a haptic feedback it s one le move part to break but it felt a littl fake to me while appl say the s screen is more color and brighter than past model i couldn t realli see the benefit outdoor appl s iphon actual lag behind samsung it lcd ha the same old thick border while samsung s ole screen go right to the edg those samsung screen also cram in more than three time the pixel make them amaz for look at photo and text and use for new invent like virtual realiti on the subject of anxieti when will we be abl to carri an iphon without fear a crack screen sure design guru joni ive doesn t want u to keep encas our iphon in rubber is it worth upgrad your two year old or older iphon ye will mani of u want to
