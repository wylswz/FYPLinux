telling my story isn   t going to be easy  oftentimes i feel embarrassed  enraged  and regretful when i have to relive it  but in the end it is a story and life lesson which should be shared so that others may know major red flags to look out for when choosing to work for a startup or new business  what you are about to read is true and happened within the last four months  the names have been changed to protect the innocent and guilty it all started in may      when i was searching angel co for opportunities in the bay area while living in dallas  i applied for a marketing director position with startup x and soon received an invitation to interview with the cto  i took the initial phone screen in los angeles where i happened to be  and he asked me to fly out the next day to meet in santa clara  the responsibility of the less than    hours flight wasn   t addressed  so i asked who would be covering it  when the cto asked me to book it and told me it would be reimbursed later  i was hesitant and skeptical but followed through with blind faith  there   s no way a startup i found on angel co is going to screw me over  i thought  the next day  i was in startup x   s office meeting the co founders and small dev team of   michael  the ceo  introduced himself as the owner of a successful international mining business group  a millionaire investor  and a former jpmorgan analyst  charlie  the cto  founded his first startup right out of college  sold one in the past few years  and worked with ibm  both men pitched their experience to me more than their product  i later learn this is a recurring theme in investor meetings   nevertheless i thought they had a viable idea and one that i was interested in building  they told me that i would have   m for the marketing budget and carte blanche to build my team  they seemed like veteran entrepreneurs  the kind i could trust  but one thing that would later haunt me was something charlie said  when i asked him if hired employees were given a probationary period  it was standard for several of my past employers   he said    no  because i hire fast and fire fast     i didn   t know which part of that sentence gave me more pause red flag     when someone says they    hire fast and fire fast    believe them and walk away after our interview they took me to lunch with the rest of the team and asked for a high level marketing plan for round two  the following week i received a check in the mail for my reimbursed flight expenses  i delivered a keynote with my marketing team plans  and i received a job offer  we had to negotiate and rewrite my employment contract a couple of times  it was written by someone with absolutely no hr experience   but we finally agreed on a         sign on bonus  relocation assistance   a          salary  equity  and a   month severance package if i were to leave for good reason and without cause  which was defined as role   compensation changes  office relocation over    miles  cease of operations  or change in the company   s market focus   it was a pretty solid deal and i had always wanted to move to california  after a final review  i signed the contract and took a pre planned trip to japan for two weeks red flag     if it is too good to be true  it probably is while in japan  the ceo called me  knowing i was on vacation  and asked me to put together an user acquisition strategy over the next couple of days  wanting to put a good foot forward  i brushed off the confusion  chalked it up to culture  and spent time on what he requested with the limited knowledge and resources i had at hand  i didn   t bring my computer to japan so i wrote what i could in notes and typed up the deliverable as soon as i got home  as a side dish  i included new names and logo ideas for the company since the startup had an anti seo name and wanted to be a recruiting   job platform  my first priority was branding  later on i would learn that my preliminary work was worthless because we never had a   m marketing budget which was what i based my projections on red flag     give some people an inch and they   ll take a mile  they   ll constantly test boundaries and see what they can ask of you or get away with things moved fast after that  i sold everything  packed what i couldn   t part with  and asked my boyfriend at the time to watch my cat for a month or two until i settled in  i said goodbye to my apartment of the last   years and goodbye to my city of the last    years  after   days on the road i arrived in santa clara with a car full of boxes and an excitement to start something new  both professionally and personally my first day of work was july  th  i walked into the office to find    employees  between june and july  the startup hired an additional   members  including a young social media manager who had been running marketing efforts free range prior to my arrival  i had notated in my interview keynote that this person was a team member that i would fill as marketing director  so it was interesting they decided to hire the person without communicating with me  even more interesting was the fact that she labeled herself as the    chief marketing officer    of the startup on her social media channels before she even met me  already there were signs pointing to challenges ahead red flag     if you   re a manager and your direct report is hired before you without your engagement  they may not be a good fit and compete for your job we had   young chinese employees on h  b visas with us as developers  limited in experience but eager to please and learn  they end up being the ones to suffer the most  we also had three new business development team members  one of them befriended me quickly  i   ll call him bruce  and eventually told me that he and the other two were poached from another startup across the hallway by our ceo who wanted a group of friends  essentially  they were hired bros with ambiguous titles  i quickly leaned on bruce as a friend  less cautiously than usual  because he seemed like a genuine person who was interested in helping me adjust to the new area red flag     when your leader hires people for reasons other than their professional experience or qualifications  you may have a bad leader i would spend the rest of my first week at work understanding the product  the goals  and market landscape  the co founders wanted to be the next    credit karma of linkedin    and considered their competition to include indeed  careerbuilder  angel co  zip recruiter  and of course linkedin  they had three revenue subscription models  they would charge job seekers  recruiters  and companies to use their product  it would take me a few days to figure out that we didn   t have a strong  differentiating feature from the competition and that no one would pay for something they can do for free elsewhere  when the co founders couldn   t agree on our top three selling points  i called a whiteboard session meeting  my mind was blown that no one at the company had ever done one of these before after the whiteboard session i had more clarity on where to build the marketing strategy and brand  i would continue to push new names  but in the end charlie   s choice would win and we   d blow two weeks on this task  the goal was to launch a beta product in   months by october      red flag     your product isn   t ready if you can   t tell a compelling story the following week i asked to join michael and charlie in their next investor meetings  i wasn   t sure why we were already having these meetings if we had the money and what was being discussed  but i wanted to know  our first stop with venture capital   private equity in palo alto proved to be eye opening  when the investor asked my co founders to tell him about the product  they talked about themselves  their connections  and their qualifications for    minutes instead  when we finally touched the    slide pitch deck  the investor stopped us on our team page  he asked     you have    employees  how much have you spent  and what   s the revenue     that was the first lesson i would learn from those vc investor meetings  your burn rate matters  another great question he asked was how we saw ourselves disrupting the market and if we had traction yet  michael and charlie couldn   t provide a strong argument  thinking back  the seasoned investor probably could see right through them  even before the rest of us red flag     if your founders focus on name dropping and self aggrandizement  they   re probably compensating for something lacking the second investor we met that day would ask the same questions as the one before and spend even less time with us  i consolidated notes i took from both meetings and sent them to the business development team  as soon as we got back to the office i started from scratch and condensed the pitch deck to    slides  jessica  the social media manager  apparently cried when she found out i went to these meetings she wasn   t invited to  so for the next one  i let her go in my place to get her feet wet  deep down i knew that the investors who knew what they were doing wouldn   t take us seriously at this stage  nevertheless it would be valuable experience for her to learn how to navigate these meetings  you would think a gesture like that would be seen as collaborative and team building  on the contrary  she took it as an opportunistic step for her own agenda  for the remainder of our working relationship  jessica would ignore my best practices recommendations  post spongebob memes on our facebook page  and promote her    gonzo style    writings that were often filled with typos and grammatical errors  i would frequently guide her to more relevant content and other methods of social media strategy  and she would respond adamantly with whatever she wanted to do  hands off    i trust you to do your job    boss penny had to be micromanaging    won   t take your bullshit    boss penny i don   t know when or how the money became an issue  something tells me that michael and charlie knew we were running out before i even arrived in july and they played it off for as long as they could while betting on future investors  michael covered lunch for the team everyday and sometimes dinner too on the late nights and weekends we worked  we had a cramped but decent office space         we were packed sardines at conference tables  but we made it work and told ourselves we would only endure for a little longer  a new office space lease was signed and we   d be moving in by the first week of august  the co founders had a subscription to surfair  a private airline service that mainly charlie used to go back home in so cal each weekend  adp was handling payroll up until the first week of my employment before michael fired them  or did they really fire us   everything seemed normal for a startup my first two weeks on the job until payday my first paycheck was late  jessica  tom  our new project manager who started in june   and i were the only ones that received cashier   s checks on july   th  my sign on bonus was not included  i asked about it and was told it was coming in the next check  the other employees received nothing and i   m not sure why  i can   t recall a time in my life where i was paid my wages in a cashier   s check so i requested a pay stub  charlie told me that they wouldn   t be able to help with payroll until we moved over to gusto  a new accounting system  he and michael would get back to me on this  i didn   t like this answer  considering this was my first payroll experience  i abruptly halted my apartment search and paid for a temporary airbnb covering the first half of august  the boxes of what was left of my life remained in the back seat of my car  something was up and i started feeling uncomfortable around this time  bruce and i were sharing personal concerns and he confided in me that he had let michael borrow         from his personal savings  did you read that  a startup employee gave his life savings to our ceo  he wasn   t the only one  another biz dev team bro who was crashing on the ceo   s couch  bobby  apparently lent michael five figures too  in disbelief  i asked why he needed money when he has   m already committed in the company  bruce said that michael had his offshore money tied up with the irs because of unpaid taxes and essentially his assets were frozen until he went to court  these people are not related by blood or lifelong ties so why would they trust michael enough to do this after only knowing him a few months  again  i chalked it up to bro culture and secretly hoped they would get their money back red flag     it   s a very bad sign if your founder or co founder is borrowing money from team members red flag     if your founder or co founder has history with the law  you may want to consider working somewhere else over the course of the next few weeks  tension grew  the h  b visa employees were getting nervous         they haven   t been paid since june   th  apparently this wasn   t the first time paychecks were late  several employees had to pay late rent fees for june   due to another missed payroll  michael blamed adp for this one  saying it was the reason for their contractual fallout  could have this been another scapegoat in disguise  probably  between july    and aug   we would be told  every day  that our paychecks were coming  the first few days we were told that physical checks were on ups trucks  they never came  days after that we were told that the ups checks were cancelled because they must be lost and michael would be personally wiring each of us the money  he asked us to write down our bank accounts and routing numbers  every day  he would    be at the bank    moving assets around  wiring funds and promising delivery dates that never came  it was our bank   s fault if the money wasn   t there so it was our responsibility to dispute the delinquency  in the meantime  we were still expected to work long hours and be on call for michael  one time he called me at   pm on a weeknight to talk about his ideas and how much he didn   t agree with charlie   s ideas  as each day passed with broken promises and as i would discover more truths  i became more anxious  angry  and distrustful charlie  being a co founder  didn   t help much         he would just say michael was doing his best  i find it hard to believe that charlie was that naive         as a cofounder and partner  wouldn   t you know what   s going on with your company at all times  were they playing good cop  bad cop  we had no choice but to wait and see what would happen when july   st came around  nothing happened  we now had    employees who haven   t been paid for a month  three who haven   t been paid for the last two weeks  and three who have yet to receive their sign on bonuses  at this point  i started asking michael and charlie for transparency and open communication through casual attempts first then documented attempts when it was going nowhere i received no response  we   re now into the first week of august the next day after i sent my email i walked into the dlse office to file a wage claim  i   d never done this before  after researching my options in the previous week  it took me a few days to finally make a decision  this was a special case where i believed i was protecting my rights as an employee considering i left my life in texas to work for this startup  i never received my sign on bonus which was my relocation assistance  and the co founders were going through great lengths to be dishonest about our wages  in the state of california the wage claim process is free to current and former workers and is a government protected act  in other words  you don   t have to hire a lawyer and if your company finds out you filed a claim  and they fire you for it  it is considered retaliation and it is illegal  i went back to work with the intentions of completing what i was hired to do that evening i would have dinner with a friend   s brother who used to be a lawyer  i told him about my situation  told him i filed a wage claim earlier that day and asked for his general advice  being a ceo of a startup himself  he supported my proactive efforts and helped me draft an email to the co founders  essentially  i wanted to have a conversation with them to see how i could continue working there and get paid  or how i could help the burn rate by leaving with good cause and receive my bonus and severance according to my contract  my heart sank when he said     this letter will help  and hopefully they   ll pay you what they owe you  but i really want to be upfront with you  you probably won   t see a dime  they likely don   t have it and even if they did  it   s not worth the legal battle     he   s seen this happen too many times in silicon valley  however  he also encouraged me to stay in the bay area and offered to pass along my resume to peers about this time  two big investors we were counting on fell through at the last minute  my gut told me it had something to do with our leadership  michael was not happy  michael and charlie would finally admit  after a barrage of daily money questions  that they had been banking on these investors to come through to help with payroll  once michael goes to court in new york his millions of dollars would be freed up for the company thursday  august  th was d day  this was the day that set the destructive snowball in motion  that afternoon in the office  michael emailed each employee a personalized pdf receipt of a wells fargo wire transfer with the message    here is the receipt  it has been calculated for the taxes on your semi monthly salary and signing bonus  the money is arriving either today or tomorrow  i am sorry about the delay    notice the areas i highlighted in yellow  now look at this google search image we found by typing in the search term     wells fargo wf surepay wire transfer confirmation     you can also find the original image here here   s a side by side comparison what you are seeing is a photoshopped google search image that was posed as a real wells fargo wire transfer sent to    employees via email by the ceo  the account it was sent from is supposedly michael   s lawyer in new york  when i googled his name  i found nothing  the dates at the bottom of the pdf are exactly the same  the last time i checked it was        the account     s end in the same digits  and the expected delivery date was the same day these confirmation emails were sent out  was the money in our accounts  no  also note that the forged wire transfer states the money was sent out aug  nd  the same day i asked for transparency and was ignored  even the damn transfer time stamps are exactly the same  i still didn   t get the pay stub i requested  whoever photoshopped these documents has the intelligence of a  th grader  but even worse is the person who thought this was a good idea  think about it  the scam artist sat there and concocted this in his head instead of telling us the truth that the money wasn   t there  he then weighed the pros and cons and decided it was worth it  then he took the time to photoshop in each of his    employees    names  or he forced someone else to do his dirty work   he then had the nerve to walk into the office with a smile and say that he has proof that he sent the wire transfers  he also said that if the money wasn   t in our accounts it wasn   t his fault and to call our banks to complain about it  i recall the moment clearly when michael sat next to me and emailed me my wire transfer confirmation first  i replied to his email with    thank you     he looked up from his computer and said    i   m sitting right here  you can tell me to my face     with a self satisfied smile  i did  later that same day  when everyone was cheerful and joking from the relief the wire confirmations brought  michael said under his breath in our second language     look at those chinese kids  they   re pretty happy they got paid  huh    stop for a moment and think about how you would feel after receiving some kind of confirmation that money you worked hard for is coming to you today after you   ve been waiting for over a month  feels good and stress relieving  right  you   d want to celebrate  now next imagine how you would feel after you realized you were not only lied to but considered dumb enough to fall for a ruse  your intern found the original image  identified the forgery and told you     impossible  there   s no way anyone would do something like that     you say  then you take a closer look yourself and that horrible feeling starts to sink in  you   d feel crushed and shocked  i   m sure  i felt all those things and much  much more  i felt hopelessness and blackout rage  that afternoon  i sent the co founders the email my lawyer friend and i drafted  we didn   t deserve this charade and treatment  there was no going back  i only sought justice and my wages at this point red flag      there   s a huge moral and legal difference between buying time with lies versus calculated fraud again  things moved fast after that  i encouraged other employees to file wage claims  adam and darren  both dev team members and friends  turned in their paperwork and thought they could trust jessica enough to share their exit plans because she had been complaining about the late payments and threatened to    out    the co founders on social media  strangely  she ended up changing her mind the next day about filing her own claim and we soon learned why the h  b visa employees felt trapped and paralyzed since the startup sponsored them  they were miserable and stressed from not having money in their accounts  miraculously  they all still believed in their cto leader  charlie  even if michael was the wrongdoer  charlie was someone they respected and trusted  many of them said they would only leave the company if charlie ever left  this was one case of unshaken faith i   ve never seen in a workplace throughout my entire career  i have to give it to them         it was inspiring and respectful  but saddening at the same time  the young and inexperienced tend to be more hopeful and trustful than someone who   s been through the wringer like me bruce  the first team member who i entrusted my concerns with  turned out to be a mole of the ceo  we found out that he would befriend all employees and regurgitate their concerns or complaints to michael  when adam and darren shared their thoughts about not coming to work until they got paid  bruce ratted them out  somehow he also found out about the wage claims  i   m sure you can guess who spilled the beans on that one  michael threatened to fire them and charlie ended up    letting them go     they were the first two to leave  i would be the third after michael and charlie received my email on thursday night they didn   t know what to do with me  charlie replied and said we could talk monday  they knew they had to pay me and pay us or they would have a serious issue to deal with  on friday  we all received a group text from michael i chose to go the office anyways because where else am i going to go  no one was there in the morning  adam and darren texted me and later joined me along with a few developers  we talked about the current situation and decided to make a conference call to charlie who happened to be at a family reunion in oregon  adam asked him if he thought michael really had the money or if we all should prepare for the worst  charlie said he knew about the forged wire transfers but still encouraged everyone to wait it out  when one of the developers asked him if he had put in any personal money into the company  charlie said he put in          to cover the last payroll  was he telling the truth  what did bruce and bobby   s money cover then  our startup might as well have been called bro bailout  i left the office after that call and drove to half moon bay to clear my mind we received a similar text from michael the following monday saying red flag      you shouldn   t be going to work if they   re not paying you anyways again  i decided to go in the office  when i showed up  jessica  tom  and the business development team were there  everyone was acting weird  no one would make eye contact with me and would whisper around the corner  they knew something i didn   t  this was the first sign that my fate with the startup had been decided  both charlie and michael were outside avoiding us in the office  they probably didn   t expect me to come in  and i had to chase down charlie for the conversation that was promised  he told me he had no news and that i should just go home and come back tomorrow  without knowing what else to do  i did  the next day was august  th i came into the office as usual and endured the silent treatment for a short time before michael asked me to have a talk  when we stepped outside he told me that things weren   t working out  that i had tried to    kill the company by turning the team against him by encouraging them to file wage claims     and that i took credit for work i didn   t do  i   m sure you can guess whose    work    i supposedly took credit for  i calmly told michael that firing me for the wage claims was considered retaliation and illegal in the state of california and if he wanted to fire me for cause  aka    performance reasons     he had the right to do so  but i had evidence to prove otherwise and he still legally owed me my wages  bonus and severance  earlier in the week i had taken screenshots of our trello task board  jessica was changing it around to make it look like i did nothing   i forwarded myself each work communication email  each passive aggressive comment jessica would mistakenly post through our company   s facebook page and delete later  i received notifications as a page admin   every instance michael promised payments  and of course most importantly the forged wire transfers  if there   s anything you take away from my story i hope it is this  always cya  i packed my laptop and caught charlie on the way out  he was more professional and cordial  we actually shook hands  thanked each other for the opportunity  and he promised to let me know when he could pay me and everyone else  i walked away with a mixed feeling of relief and disappointment before mailing off my retaliation complaint to the state it   s been three weeks since i left the startup  charlie texted me on august   th saying he had my paycheck and to come return the work laptop and key to the office  when i showed up he had me sign a pay stub copy that breaks down all the taxes that were taken out of my two paychecks  the numbers add up except for my full sign on bonus and severance according to my contract  i would have to fight michael for both of those in court  i wonder where the money for this round came from i would get an opportunity to interview with a successful startup in mountain view that week  but they couldn   t match the salary i had relocated for  after crashing a friend   s pad in san francisco for a couple of weeks to save money  i decided to drive back to dallas to be with loved ones again  is this temporary or permanent  that will be determined upon my next job  i even picked up where i left off in my old apartment         it was still on the market and my landlord welcomed me with open arms  it   s pretty empty as i sold everything and have to start over  but getting my old home and cat back again was a silver lining i was happy to receive as of today the startup is under a new name  this is their  rd in   months  jessica is now cmo  still posting memes  pushing her own agenda  and still taking credit for my work  michael fired his partner and co founder charlie on august   nd  blaming him for the recent troubles     not knowing how to run a company     and blowing all of his money with nothing to show  i wonder  did charlie really get fired though or is this another ruse  he is still listed as cto on his linkedin profile  a couple days after he left  they went shopping at ikea for new furniture  the h  b kids are still there  they didn   t follow charlie  at this point  nothing about that startup surprises me anymore and it all seems like a horrible nightmare i was lucky enough to wake up from  i still have the wage claim and retaliation complaint on file with california and will be following up with them  as for bruce and bobby  i don   t think they ever got their money back  the last time i checked the team page on the site  michael changed his profile picture to a bulldog  it reminded me of the unusual remarks he used to make about keeping his anonymity online  back when i believed in him i thought it had something to do with his high profile family background  he claimed he was related to celebrities and political figures   he didn   t want his face associated with the brand and he outsourced a chinese agency to scrub the internet of his name  if you look up his linkedin or facebook profile he has other stock images in place of his picture  he   s a guy with no face  i wonder what his real name is red flag      when your ceo doesn   t want any pictures of himself online and outsources an agency to scrub his history from the internet  he   s hiding something there   s this default human condition to trust others and give the benefit of the doubt  some may question why i took the job in the first place or continued to work for them when there were so many red flags  to those people i say this  there is also a default human condition to not give up  in hindsight  yes i could have probably saved myself the heartache  but in the end i took a risk i thought worth taking  it brought me to silicon valley  i met new and wonderful  smart  talented people  it felt great to work my ass off  i had the opportunity to sit across major vc investors and learn the right questions to ask  i   m not as naive with silicon valley and startups  i learned how the state of california fiercely protects employees    rights  i came to appreciate dallas more and all the things i took for granted like proximity to friends  family  wide open spaces  and a place to call home  i haven   t given up on silicon valley or california  and i sure as hell haven   t given up on good people  i hope you never have to experience what i went through  but if you have  please share your story so that others may learn and know that they are not alone when it comes to startup fraud
