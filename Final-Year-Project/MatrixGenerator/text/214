that night  while riding my motorcycle with my college mates to the lonely lake few miles away from my home  bang  i accidentally invented    distant alcohol detector    which could detect drunk drivers while hanging on traffic poles from the distance of     meters i  being a fun loving guy and with stay curious attitude  i wanted to try how it feels to be under the influence of alcohol  i asked my best pal  who is a party guy in our group  that i want to try alcohol once he never says no to the party and we had an awesome party that night  that was my first time in my life feeling how it feels to be high it was the time to turn on alcohol induced adventure mode  tadaa  we were on our motorcycles on the way to the lake which is    km away from my home when i feel adventurous on motorcycle   pi was enjoying the drive till a car with high beam headlights crossed in front of me  everything became glassy  all i can see was the light scattering from the car   s headlights  it felt like heavens opening the door curious me started to think why the light is scattering at the wider angle while i was on alcohol but it is not the same when i was sober  i keep on thinking what might be the reason till we reached the lake  then i realized  the scattering was not from the car   s headlights but it was scattering of light at my eyeballs  eurekaaa   next day morning when i woke up sober  the first thing i did was an intensive research on concepts of light scattering  diffraction  diffusion  total internal reflection etc    combining theories  previous night experience and everything nice  i invented the device from the next century  its the    distant alcohol detector    alert  geek stuff  the phenomenon which helped me for this invention was that whenever blood mixes with other solution like alcohol  its refractive index varies due to which it starts to scatter the light more than in the absence of alcohol  that   s the reason why you feel glassy eyes when you are high on alcohol i used this phenomenon and built a quick prototype which consisted of a simple camera  infrared light generator of the specific wavelength not visible to the bare eyes but could be seen through the camera  and image processor  whenever the camera detects a vehicle  infrared light generator emits the ir rays towards the driver  if the driver is drunk  ir rays will be scattered at a higher rate from the driver   s eye which is directly proportional to the concentration of alcohol  which is then sensed by the camera and image processors and report would be sent out to the authorities along with vehicle details and alcohol percentage to which driver is influenced infrared light from tv remote could only be seen through the camera that essentially the    distant alcohol detector     which could detect drunk drivers from far away distance which started that night as a fun  ended up as an invention for the future  i thought of making this as a startup while i was in college but to build a hardware company it is always expensive and i couldn   t afford it  so i gave all the research data to my professors to publish it you drive drunk across a traffic signal which had the device installed  your next stop would be in jail everyone will reach home safer to make their small waiting for daddy daughter smile i am currently running my software startup and i dream of building this product once i make enough money to develop it founder at weloft labs   entrepreneur   programmweloft labs  is the one of the fastest growing mobile development company in silicon valley which delivers world class applications to its clients
