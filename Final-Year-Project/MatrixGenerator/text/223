so after that whole fiasco last week  i basically kept going like a broken tape recorder that wouldn   t give up  i got up in the morning  brewed coffee  and sat down to either do some uploads or see what i had to fix that was when i started to notice it  i was losing it every time james  mj and i talked on the phone  or when we talked on slack  i was just pissed off a lot of the times for instance  james would bring up talk of funding and i would say  k so are we gonna have it or what james  we have a good chance alex  yeah well  what chance is good chance james  it   s a good chance alex  fuck off  chance is chance  either it will happen or it won   t now  the state of being pissed off can be caused by many things  in this particular case though  it was an obvious one  i was stressed beyond a level that i hadn   t encountered truth be told  this whole experience has been about just keep on pushing my stress threshold to the maximum  i think though  after the toronto trip  and the race to finish the mvp  something got fried in my brain and it was spreading so i decided to take a break over the last thanksgiving  canadian  weekend  in fact we called for radio silence on all our communication channels so that we could all take tabulit off our minds for once coincidentally  that was when the designers  mina   chelsea  were coming over for a weekend visit  it was perfect the first thing i did once i  with persistent encouragement from james  decided to just get tabulit out of my head was play overwatch on my ps  for the next   hours  i main mercy  shoutout to all the mercy players  we are the light in the dark dark dark place that is overwatch quickplay  i got suspended from comp for leaving too many times  then the designers arrived and we proceeded to do many things such as eating poutine drinking  got isabelle out for this one  eating late night ramen eating dumplings drawing a portrait of mj  it   s uncanny  and watching montreal   s night from the mount royal lookout this happened over saturday and sunday  and it was a merry time  also  i went apple picking with my girlfriend and two other friends on sunday  we now have enough apples to last a hundred apple pies anyways so that did cool my head but at the end of the day  when i got back on the tabulit train on tuesday  this is what i learned i   d rather be getting the job done then taking a break i was itching basically every day to post a message on slack  or talk about something that had crossed my mind  and then i just wanted to talk about everything when the weekend ended  which is not to say that the break was much needed  it   s just that at some point  getting your third play of the game as mercy for the day gets boring  i   m just so good with the heals man   and now i know for sure nothing excites me as much as tabulit i drink a lot of coffee and i say random thnews and more from tabulit  indie fiction   indie comics  coming september
