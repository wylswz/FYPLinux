my     day experiment saved my life  i know that sounds dramatic   but the results really were that dramatic  whether you want to make a habit or break a habit  there is something special about     days     the     day experiment is a game changer  whatever habit it is you want to make  or break          there   s something magical about picking a thing and doing it for     days  it   s enough time to make a difference  but not enough time for panic about doing something uncomfortable forever to kick in       in december      i decided i had to do something  i was sick  so sick  everything hurt all the time  my whole body was swollen and miserable  i was starting to have trouble moving  i was so tired that i could barely function     then i came across this blog post that talked about how much a person needed to to eat just to survive  it was way more than i would have expected  in desperation  i decided to try eating at or above that amount  instead of continuing an insane cycle of eating far too little  followed by far too much  and exercising for    minutes a day for     days     it changed my life  by the end of the     days i felt better  a lot better  better enough to keep going for another     days since then  i   ve used the     day experiment in lots of ways  including helping me get back on track when i lost my way with writing  seriously         try writing for    minutes a day for     days  just see what happens     i think there   s a kind of magic in     days  it   s long enough to internalize a new behavior and make it your new habit  i know  i know   that   s supposed to happen in    days  it doesn   t for me  after    days  it   s still too easy to go back to my old habit  but after     days   just about three and a half months   whatever is going to stick from what you   re doing is stuck  you aren   t doing it just because you   re supposed to anymore  you   re doing it because it   s just what you do     it   s also short enough not to trigger panic at the idea of doing something new forever  i don   t know about you  but that   s the worst feeling for me  even if something feels good  the idea of just never not doing it makes me anxious  i love that     days is just the right amount of time  long enough  but not too long  there are plenty of things that i don   t worry about doing forever  i don   t panic at the idea of having to read books until i die or never being able to stop going to the grocery store     turns out that     days is long enough for something to stop being what you have to do  and start being just what you do  and if it   s not   well  it   s a good thing there   s another     days coming up right behind the first  right     i propose that we make the     day experiment the lynch pin of the slow down revolution  instead of trying to find the shortest route to a new habit  we   ll take it slow  make habits that stick  instead of constantly trying to beat them into ourselves  three weeks at a time     here   s how to set up a     day experiment of your own     choose a thing you want to incorporate into your life don   t get overly ambitious or complicated here  think of something simple  but that will have a big impact  it can be big and difficult to do  trust me when i say that in the beginning  the idea of exercising for even    minutes made me want to cry    but it should also be simple  that way there   s less wiggle room if you   re trying to build a daily writing habit  my suggestion is  write for    minutes a day     make a commitment to do that thing for     daywrite it down  tell someone  tell everyone  get a calendar and some gold stars and give yourself one for each day that you follow through     when it gets hard  remind yourself that it   s only     days  just focus on doing what you   ve promised yourself you will do today  instead of focusing on the end goal  when the going gets tough put your effort into just making sure that today isn   t the day you quit     keep a journthis is optional  but i found it really helpful  i started a tumblr blog and wrote about my experiment everyday for     days  it helped  if you   re not quite the over sharer that i am  just get a notebook and jot down a few lines everyday  write about how you feel  record your little victories  pay attention to how doing your thing is affecting your life   you can download a     day journal here      take another     days if you need to  or want to i wasn   t ready to stop after     days  i didn   t feel like i was ready to  so i didn   t  i just kept going for another     days  it was obvious to me when i didn   t need to formality anymore   i stopped wanting to write about it  my journal entries started to be come routine  instead of full of new discoveries and wonder at how good i was feeling  if you   re afraid you   ll go back to your old habit when your     days is over  that   s okay  just keep going want a pdf of the steps to starting
