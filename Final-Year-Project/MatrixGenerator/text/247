about   years ago  in a private conference room of a paris hotel  i sat silent as two grown men yelled business oriented insults at each other  one of them         a bearded and bespectacled  seasoned and mostly soft spoken executive         finally had enough and stormed out of the room as our team assembled the next morning  the executive quietly mentioned a family emergency that required him to return home to another country  acknowledging nothing of the tension from the day before  he apologized to the nine other executives for missing the rest of our four day offsite         and exited just another ordinary day as part of the highly dysfunctional executive team of a   b revenue company early in my career  i always thought everyone else had it figured out  while my team   s dynamic might be unfortunate  others were operating with clarity  openness  communication and efficiency  they knew the answers  they listened  they were respectful  they promoted each other   s skills  they accepted failure  they challenged each other and loved it they         that company you   d always admired from afar         they were gods among men and women  they         the pedestal quality  celebrity like  media worthy    they were out there but now that i   ve been part of dozens of teams  i   ve found that they are a myth  they are imaginary  the truth  every team is a mess  every team is totally fucked up  they are all dysfunctional in their own special way let   s talk about the team i   m on now  this one is a venture backed startup comprised of   people  mylestoned   and i happen to be the ceo  here are a few things that we   re working through am i worried  sure  i worry every day         but i   m not paralyzed  from everything i   ve experienced  this is entirely normal  every single team i   ve been on has had interpersonal issues and structural complexity the truth is co workers are often like children on a playground  taunting each other  creating tribes and cliques  choosing who gets to play and who doesn   t  they operate out of confidence and pride and fear and ego  children or adults  no single human has perfected interactions with others to a point of no conflict at larger companies         where executives were often deified as internal celebrities         some senior executives ascend due to political navigation and effective networking  not because they were more skilled or adept at working well with others  at one team i was on  a peer was secretly labelled the    brown crusader     because everything behind him turned to shit  and yet he was skilled at ensuring the mess wasn   t attributed to him   i can only imagine what they called me startups aren   t much better         in many cases individual contributors are thrust into positions as managers before they   re ready  see intelligent ly for help with that   at one of my startups  tears were a common occurrence due to teammates talking behind each other   s backs i   d argue  this is normal the fact is  a team isn   t static  rather it   s like a wave in an ocean  sometimes rising to excellence         supportive  caring  delivering         and occasionally sinking to the bottom         confused  fraught  spent  at times your team may swallow a little water  but the key is to avoid drowning in patrick lencioni   s   dysfunctions of a team  he highlights fear of conflict as a key dysfunction  and the result being    artificial harmony     on the surface everyone is smiling  but inside  things aren   t so rosy  people aren   t saying what they   re really feeling  where they   re blocked  and that   s handcuffing results my mom always said to me     if you don   t have something nice to say  then don   t say anything at all     maybe mom wasn   t right about everything ultimately  no matter what size  teams require constant  unrelenting attention  the team         for lack of a better way to put it         is a group of individuals who operate within the bounds their interpersonal conflicts allow for  limit those conflicts  and you become high performing  allow the conflicts to fester         trust to dissipate between individuals         and your chance of success is greatly limited the net is you need to maximize your teams capacity to perform    individually together  there   s no magic equation  i work on this every day  but here are three things that can help nearly a decade ago our coo         my teammate         sat across from me  stone faced  after a very combative internal meeting  once everyone else had filed out of the room  he took a breath and asked me point blank i   ve found it useful to reflect on that reminder often  if you   re on a team of any size  i hope you do  too people  if you got this far  please hit
