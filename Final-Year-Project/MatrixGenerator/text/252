hello  i   m glad that you care about women   s rights and want to be an ally  this makes you a decent human being  not to mention on the right side of history  you may have witnessed an upsurge of toxic masculinity lately         say  for example  the entire second presidential debate         drawing attention to what has always been here under the surface but perhaps has not always been as visible to you  you might have even experienced some degree of guilt or shame for being a man when some men are acting in such vile  repugnant ways and making decisions for women without actually listening to women  we are all trying our best to be good people in the world and this shit is complicated  but there are a few things you might want to know  i wrote this for you    it is not women   s responsibility to educate you  teach yourself about sexism and misogyny and about how to recreate our culture to eliminate them  just as it is white people   s responsibility to educate themselves and figure out how to dismantle the racist culture we made  you men  the beneficiaries of our patriarchal culture  need to figure out how to undo your sexist and misogynistic ideas  belief systems  and behaviors  you need to figure out how to change internally and externally so that we live in a culture that truly values and supports women  here   s a great place to start    don   t ask women to do additional emotional labor  women have been socialized to be caretakers and nurturers  some of us embrace this role and others of us don   t  but none of us want to do this all the time  what does emotional labor look like  listening to others talk about their problems  processing issues and providing advice  caring for others    feelings  offering space and time and  sometimes  physical affection in the form of hugs and handholding  because women have been socially conditioned to see this labor as part of our role as women and because people of all genders have been conditioned to see women as caretakers  you might not realize when you are asking women to do this  check in with the women in your life before you ask them to provide emotional support  make sure they have the time  energy  and resources to offer it  make sure you have their permission  notice the amount of space you take up in a conversation  does this sound exhausting  it is  and this is the work women do all the time  we do this work on top of the work of walking through the world while female  which i assure you is time consuming  laborious  hard  and often demoralizing  lastly  don   t engage women you don   t know or barely know in intense emotional revelations  i don   t need to know from the man in line at the grocery about his recent traumas  i don   t need to deal with the cantankerous discharge of a stranger   s horrible day  you are taking an emotional dump all over us  take care of your own emotional needs    think about the space you take up  in conversations  in board rooms  at public events  on conference panels  walking down the street  think about your proximity to women  ask yourself whether you are giving them enough space  to talk  to move  to exist  this is especially true if you encounter a woman alone  give her space    do your homework and seek out women   s perspectives  read articles and books about intersectional feminism  read articles and books that have nothing to do with feminism but that are written by women  look at your bookshelf  is it full of mostly male authors  think of why that might be  then  commit to exclusively reading work by women         from all different countries  with different backgrounds and identities         for a week  a month  a year or more  ask the women in your life for recommendations of books that changed their lives  books where they felt deeply heard or seen  read those books    ask the women in your life to share their stories with you  be okay if they don   t want to  and if they do want to  really listen  these cascading stories are often fraught  violent  and deeply sad  you might feel shocked  angry  or full of sorrow that someone you know and love had to go through these experiences  don   t shut down because you feel uncomfortable or even complicit  don   t try to make the stories better  don   t dismiss women   s words  in your mind or to the woman you are listening to  don   t find reasons to excuse others    bad behavior  choose to show up  choose to continue to listen    if you are a maker  think about the things you make  remember that the work you offer into the world as an artist  writer  filmmaker  musician  or other maker is reflecting a certain perspective  yours  think about what you are making and what it says to those that engage with it  are all your female characters one dimensional  are they always to blame for the woes of your male protagonist  how many women are you interviewing for your documentary  did you integrate a mix of voices in terms of ethnicity  nationality  socio economic class  ability levels  size and shape  sexuality  placement along the gender binary  what are your songs about and what worldview do they reflect  is the art you make reinforcing problematic cultural narratives    find other men doing this work  learn from them  share resources  and then         and this is really important         have conversations with your male friends  colleagues  and neighbors about sexism and misogyny  instigate the difficult conversations  ask hard questions of yourselves and one another  you have likely lived most of your life without having to think about these things  women haven   t had this luxury  be uncomfortable  but also  find support in doing this work    respect women   s boundaries  no means no  period  you have no right to a woman   s body  time  energy  attention  respect  and so on  relatedly  if a woman gives clear signals  verbally or otherwise  that she does not want you to interact with her  leave her alone    don   t police women   s bodies or voices  women are autonomous beings  and contrary to cultural messages that say otherwise  we don   t exist for the pleasure of others  what we wear  where we walk  what we do or don   t do with our bodies is no one   s concern but our own  similarly  women are allowed to have our own perspectives  and to articulate them in the ways we choose   and just because a woman disagrees with you does not mean that she doesn   t understand the complexities of the situation and needs an explanation     doing this work doesn   t make you a hero  but it does make you a better human  all of us should be feminists because being a feminist means you believe women are equal and should be treated as such  you are doing the right thing  but you don   t deserve accolades or applause  just like a father doesn   t deserve these for changing his child   s diaper  you do get the reward of being a woke man  a man who is moving through the world with integrity     realize that doing this work is not a one shot deal  if you want to be an ally  it means you commit to a lifetime of continuing education  it means you look hard at your own shit  it means you look for ways to support the women in your life  it means you determine ways to work on a community and systemic level  you will be uncomfortable a lot of the time  you will likely get defensive  but you keep trying     choose to create a culture that inherently values women  make this list obsolete lisa m  o   neill is an essayist and journalist covering the intersection of pop culture and politics
