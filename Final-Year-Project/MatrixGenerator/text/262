hey molly here   s my idea  it might not be a good one  but i figure we don   t have much to lose you mentioned donald trump in your piece  the constant orange haired blob that spews hatred out of every orifice who is despressingly close to becoming president of the united states you seek to avoid him  don   t we all since avoidance is impossible for the moment  i suggest another alternative every time you look at that rotund pile of moron  i want him to be a reminder for you  a reminder that he is everything you   re not he has spent his entire life compensating for the parts of himself he hates  never facing his fear  or his inadequacies  never questioning himself  he is in other words  terrified of his own humanity you  molly  are not  and while you   re exhausted and feel overwhelmed and inadequate  you should also know that by facing these parts of yourself you   re also proving yourself to be a beautiful human being so every time you see that upright walrus bellowing hatred and insecurity know that you are the equal and opposite reaction  a woman fully experiencing her humanity instead of running from it  a full beautiful soul instead of a hollowed out husk i hope that helps writer of fiction and uninformed opinions  lives in the light  thinks in the shadows  nyc  want to connect   email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script   e t length e    if t e  getattribute  data cfhash   return t e     if t   c t previoussibling   p t parentnode if a c getattribute  data cfemail    for e    r   x  a substr        n   a length n n    e              x  a substr n    r  tostring      slice     p replacechild document createtextnode decodeuricomponent e   c  p removechild t   catch u
