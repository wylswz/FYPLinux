next hom consol and handheld the hybrid consol ont cal the nintendo nx is now off known a the nintendo switch it s every bit a crazy a you expect and quit remov from the leak design we ve seen the past few mon we re back in new york thi novemb for the th edit of our grow focus technolog ev we knew the consol would work a both at hom and on the go but it s a lot mor modul than rum suggest it s abl to transform from a handheld to a consol by simply drop it into a the simply nam switch dock the transit from smal to big screen hap inst the main control unit look a lot lik a smal wii u pad with a big screen but it ha a neat trick the sid pop off to becom individ control thes sid ar cal joy con a portmanteau of joystick control presum the d pad is replac by four button on the left joy con in ord to maintain symmetry the ide is that not on can you tak the ful pow hom consol anywh with you but you can also easy invit a friend to play a two play gam right on screen at a tim when virt real consol mak you mor isol than ev nintendo want you to go out and play with oth ther s also a built in kickstand a wel what appear to be a car mount access to mak it easy to play with oth whil out and about the joy con can also be us sep from the screen for singl play us a wel and when you re play at hom you can plac the main unit into a dock and remov the control and pop them into the joy con grip that imit a tradit remot for a bit of ad comfort the control when combin includ the us dual analog and with four abxy button a pair of should button two trig through it s not clear if thes ar press sensit or just simpl click and button borrow from the wii and wii u a wel a two new squ and circ button as prevy ment the tradit d pad s been replac by anoth set of four button if you real want that d pad back ther s also a pro control but it s not clear if thes includ any particul feat ov the norm setup as far a we can tel ther is no mot control on any of the dev oh and ye the switch us cartridg simply cal gam card nintendo isn t say very much about the consol just yet but we do know it s pow by a custom nvid tegr process nvid say the develop took up man year of effort to fit a pow consol in what s ostens a handheld form fact the consol is pow by the nvid s latest pasc mm microarchitect which brought about the hug perform boost seen in the company s new sery card in nvid s word the nintendo switch s gam expery is also support by ful custom softw includ a revamp phys engin new libr adv gam tool and libr nvid addit cre new gam ap to ful har thi perform the newest ap nvn wa built spec to bring lightweight fast gam to the mass gameplay is furth enh by hardw accel video playback and custom softw for audio effect and rend it s fair to assum it won t be a pow a the much larg xbox on and ps it s obvy a lot smal and ther s no ment of k or vr anywh though nvid s tegr chipset should definit be pow enough for handl k streaming for the lik of netflix and such lik on the the xbox on s stil we hav to applaud nintendo for doing someth way diff from everyon els and thi doesn t seem quit a esot a the wii u eith ther s a lot of pract sens to the design and the emphas on in person multiplay is a nic chang of pac from the solitud of onlin gameplay oth than the legend of zeld brea of the wild for which ther s a new trail by the way we don t know much about what s com to switch but the annount trail did provid som clu as the verg point out six titl show up in the rev most of thes appear to be titl s we ve already heard of in som capac the af zeld what seem to be mario kart the eld scrolls skyrim an nba k gam and splatoon the new titl is unsurpr a mario gam it might just be demo foot mad for the trail but giv ther s no way nintendo won t releas a mario platform for switch it s fair to assum it s at least an ear vert of a real gam thi on break away from the isomet view of sup mario d world with the camer instead follow clos behind mario in the styl of sup mario it also isn t explicit shown but the trail suggest it wil be play in multiplay with the joy con a wel meanwhil nintendo rev publ and develop bring softw for switch the consol is stil slat to launch in
