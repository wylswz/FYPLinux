aww  jeez alright  one thing i have known since before i could remember my age that i was an improviser of sorts  by which i mean that my approach to pretty much anything has always been to charge in  while learning as much as i could by practicing technically  and do what felt like the    best    thing i could  under the circumstances  this worked somewhat for me with music  much better as a chef  and variously in other realms  i realize that this comment is fairly bland and general so far  but stick with me  at age six i realized that i could put words on paper and other people  reading them  would sort of understand the story i was trying to tell  as long as i followed a few basic rules  thanks  mrs  thompson    so  occasionally  i would write some things  usually in thrall of a rule i was testing  like many autistics  i am all about rules  finding them  making them  breaking them open to see how they work        i would test my    rules    by writing things while using them  and see if anybody    got it     if they didn   t  then i had broken the rule  or it wasn   t a rule at all  just another mis understanding as i have said before  i do not trust many people  when i write hard  just me against the words  and put it out there  out here   if one or two of the people i trust    get it     whatever    it    is  in the moment  that   s partway to success  because i like to see that i   m communicating  saying the thing  but really  success is knowing that i said the thing and more  as much as i could say with the words and the pacing and the style and the structure and the resonances and the metaphor  but bigger      in that moment  in the moment of reading  do i know what i wrote  okay  good enough  or is it a little smaller than me  do i contain it  then i can do better  no matter how good it seems  or is it bigger than me  did i have one of those moments where it connects me with everything  i don   t know if i can say better than that  that   s success too many things  and also a farmer  i love my family more than anything else in the world  but cannot resist interesting problems in any field whatsoever
