original interview  http   www techiesproject com wendy zenone tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i grew up in the santa cruz mountains  i have three sisters  i come from very old fashioned italian background  i wasn   t encouraged to do a lot in terms of career  it   s kind of the mindset that you get married  you have kids  you stay home or get a small job  but your husband has the main job role  that   s what you do i ended up going down a path that wasn   t necessarily    i guess the word i   m looking for is fulfilling  i got married at twenty three  had my son at twenty five  and became an aesthetician  though i was grateful for my job  it was not stimulating  and financially  it was not fulfilling  i wanted to also be an inspiration for my son  how could i tell him to do all these things  like learn how to code and that tech was the future  when i wasn   t going down that path myself one day  i re applied to college  i majored in communications  since i knew i was good at that  even though i knew i wanted to do so much more  i started taking classes through the university of massachusetts  i did all my classes online  and after i accumulated enough credits  i was accepted into the bachelor program  i looked at the program and realized this would take me years to complete  as a mother in her mid thirties  i didn   t have the luxury of time that someone in their early twenties may have  i needed to figure out a different path  i started looking into internships  and found an internship with a pr company  the woman who hired me was named xinea  through her  i was exposed to tech startups and bitcoin  i worked with her for a few months  and then i got a call from facebook  i interviewed  but did not expect to actually get the job offer  surprisingly  they offered me a position with the ads department  it just seemed like everything i was aiming for just kept happening         which  i don   t how that happened  but it worked out at facebook  i worked on a tool that enables you to customize what kind of ads come into your feed  while i was there i took advantage of many of the programs they offered to their employees  they offered some free coding programs  like a php coding program for just women  it was my first experience even using the command line  i didn   t even know what terminal was  let alone php or python  being able to see that you can manipulate or create tools using these languages was just very exciting  i eventually looked into different coding boot camps  i looked into hackbright  an all coding female boot camp  i attempted to start my application  and then i stopped  i saw the acceptance rate was about four percent  because i thought        i   m a parent  i   m a wife  i   m in my thirties  i have no business doing this  i don   t know anything technical to be able to say that i want to be a software engineer     i put that on hold for about a year  i started looking outside of facebook for jobs  because i was really interested in engineering  but also more of the security aspect of it  i found a job with whitehat security  the position was in marketing  which is fine i still felt like there was a part of the tech world that i wanted to be in  but i didn   t feel that i had that traditional background to get there  i didn   t go to a major big name school  i didn   t have a computer science degree  i was in my later thirties  and i had children  it just seemed like everything that was supposed to have already happened  i missed out on  i talked to my husband  who was very supportive  he   s a self taught security professional and one of the most intelligent people i know  he helped when i felt like giving up  he encouraged me to apply for hackbright  he kept me going initially  i did not get in  i received a email that said i was not accepted and to try again in six months  i just felt that if i lost this opportunity  i would lose it forever  this was my moment  i wrote them an email and i said     i was so nervous on my interview  i did not represent myself in a way that truly conveyed who i am  please give me another chance     they wrote me back  and they said     we have never allowed anyone to re do an interview  but your email was so encouraging that we are going to allow you to interview again    my second interview was much better and i was accepted  once i started my cohort  i still felt a little bit like a fish out of water  but it was understanding the technology and understanding what it is that they teach women that don   t know anything about software development  you can come in to hackbright with a background in tech  or you can come in knowing nothing  that   s basically where i came in  i was starting from the ground up after i graduated  i went through many interviews  i was going through multiple software engineering position interviews  but i still felt that i wanted to to pursue security  i found an opening at lending club and it was through a network of people i knew  they offered me a position on the application security team  now  two weeks into it  i am an application security engineer  i was an aesthetician  laughs   it   s so random and exciting tell me more about the challenges of getting to this point         like you commuted four hours a day  what were some of the challenges of this experience  and the hardships that you had to overcome i had mentioned before that when i first started becoming interested in learning how to code  i had a very limited technical background  i was not a it or comp  sci major that decided     oh  i think i want to be a software engineer     i started asking some of the engineers at facebook about how i can learn how to code and what is it like to have that job  the one engineer who would sit next to me was very encouraging  he would say     it takes a lot of practice    and offer to show me how he fixes bugs in the code  not everyone is that encouraging or helpful unfortunately we had an event at facebook  and it was an ads event to teach people in other departments what the ads team does  the event had a game of thrones theme  which i was very excited about  i remember talking to someone from another team  i wanted to ask about the code but was slightly intimidated since i was very new to the world of code  so i got the courage and i said     so what code does this code run on     and there was a female engineer there and she turned to me and she just laughed in my face  she just laughed at me because i wasn   t part of that group  i was not an engineer  and obviously a noob  at that moment  i realized that high school was never over aside from my own personal challenges  i also had the challenge of maintaining my family life as well  i knew that once i started my four hour a day commute  it would be a difficult to find someone to pick up my son from the school bus  i have two other step children  so there   s three kids altogether that need to be cared for  fortunately  between my husband and family         and sometimes i would even have to leave class and do pick up         we worked it out  i would get home at      or       the kids go to bed at       i wouldn   t see them very much  but fortunately they were all understanding  it was hard to feel so out of touch with my family but i felt it was important to do this for myself         and also for the kids  they need to see the importance of not giving up and hopefully the importance of learning how to code what are some of the most exciting things to you of working in tech and coding  what part of the work really activates you my first week at my new job  we all had a one week bootcamp to get us to understand how the technology department operates  we went over everything from setting up dev environments to database schemas  i was in these classes with people who went to big colleges or had years of experiences or master degrees in computer science  seeing that i was able to contribute to the conversations         and even knew about some topics that maybe some of them didn   t         felt really good  it reminded me that i had made the right choice to quit my job and take that chance  understanding technology and knowing a coding language really gives you magic powers  it   s like being harry potter  you have a power that not many people do  and i think for me  i feel more excited about it because it was something that three years ago i wouldn   t have been able to say that i would be able to do this  it   s all still very surreal what are the biggest motivators behind your work my husband first  then the kids  my husband is very encouraging to me and that in turn motivates me  i want him to see that i can go from knowing so little  to having tech related conversations without any issue  tech is his world and i want to join him and be part of it  steve would be proud of anything i do  but it makes me happy that i am joining him in    the matrix    we tell the kids that coding is very important to learn  i feel it   s important for the future for people to understand how to code and being in tune with technology  we sent the kids to coding classes  i wanted them to see me making that effort to learn the topic that we preach about so often lastly  i am motivated by becoming an inspiration for someone else who is in a similar situation  i started taking phone calls for people that are interested in hackbright or another coding bootcamp  people who maybe aren   t sure about the commitment  i actually just got an email today from one young lady who said     i really appreciate that you encouraged me and told me the benefits of going down this path  i was just accepted to hackbright     you get to the point when you   re older that you realize there are things that  if you want to do them you   re going to have to sacrifice  i didn   t want to take no for an answer  i didn   t want to say my time is up  i wanted to be part of the harry potter group and know the magic where have you found support networks along the way  obviously your family  but have you found them in the industry as well i found most of my support through co workers in the security industry  i had some mentors  and they   re all men  which i love  because i feel that a lot of women want to be in the industry  they want to be software engineers  they want to be qa testers  they want to be in security  but the ratio is more men  i   m the only female on my team right now  which could make people uncomfortable  i am very comfortable with it and i don   t even think about the ratio  maybe others don   t feel that they have that support  but i actually feel that i have had a lot of support how do your family and friends from your past feel about how much your life has changed and all the work that you   ve done i have a coworker  katie  that still can   t believe that i   ve made it to this point  because she said         her and i  we took a python class together at facebook            i can   t believe it  you said you wanted to do this and here you are and you   re working  you   re an engineer     she gave up on learning python  it wasn   t for her  but it was nice of her to congratulate and be supportive  honestly  i don   t know if my family quite grasps what it is that i do  i think they get it  but not really  they are extremely supportive in knowing that i wanted to do something and achieved it  but i am not sure they understand the job how do you think the culmination of your background and your life experiences impact the way you approach your work as an engineer starting my first tech job made me feel like a fish out of water  i felt like i knew nothing  so to survive one day at a time i used my experience in marketing  pr  just working with people in general  this is a huge asset to have  if i came straight from just a tech background  you know i went for a tech major and maybe i didn   t have that interpersonal skills  it wouldn   t make it as easy for me to just go up to someone and say     i   m not really getting this  but  with your help i may     i feel that my communication skills have come into play and i feel it is something that can really help the team when working with other teams and developers as far as      goals  what little things are you working on right now  either for work or for yourself  like what are the things you want to accomplish this year      goals are learn as much as i can about being an applications security engineer  understanding the vulnerabilities  understanding how to secure code and understanding all the acronyms that i hear during the day  it   s all new to me  lending club gave me an opportunity to learn  and i   m going to run with that  i want to still practice everything i learned at hackbright because that was the golden ticket that got me in  i also would like to continue to help other women that are in the same place that i was in  i had moments of serious doubt and i can   t believe i thought about not taking this chance  if i could help sway more women to trust in themselves and just go for it  that would be wonderful from kind of a high level  how do you feel about the state of technology in       what really excites you  and what would you like to see change that   s a good question  i am very impressed with the way that technology is progressing  i like the ideas  i like that there   s always something new  it   s hard to keep up  i have to say  you think you have found the best tool to help with a current project  and then something new and more advanced comes out  i really enjoy that and love seeing the speed of progression  the amount of intelligence out there right now  even just in silicon valley is huge  i work with so many insanely intelligent people which has me very excited about the future and what is to come as far as what i would like to see change  right now  and it has been for the last couple years when i   ve been working  my goal has been to get into security  rewind a little bit  when i was at facebook  i knew i wanted to get into security  i had no idea how to do it  this is before even seriously considering hackbright  i went to jen henley  who is the director of security operations at facebook  and she sat down with me and just kind of gave me a guide on what to do to get into security  i started volunteering with their security awareness events  and then i went to work for whitehat security  my husband is in security  and so by osmosis  i learned to love it  i think that it is an area of technology that is overseen  people are looking for the next best company  the next best app  but they   re not looking at the dangers that are involved in it  they are not taking the time to understand all the possible vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited  all of our lives are on technology  everything important to you in online  your information  your personal lives  your photos  your family  and if someone   s not out there protecting that then all is lost what advice would you give to folks who are feeling like they have similar backgrounds to yours  maybe they feel like their ship has sailed  they   ve had kids  they are in their thirties  they feel like that there   s no way that they could get into tech now  but they would love to  what advice would you have for those folks my advice is  time is going to pass anyway  someone told me this a couple years ago and it resonated with me  it   s true  time is going to pass anyway  and you don   t want to go down the road and think     you know  i wish i did x  y  z     for me  i went to a start up convention and i just looked around and saw these people making these exciting new tech tools to improve our everyday life and i just thought  i need to know this  i want to be part of this if someone is working in a position and they   re unfulfilled or dream of changing positions and making a career change  and they think     i   m too old or i have kids  i can   t do it     then my advice is that time is going to pass regardless  and you don   t want to regret it not taking that chance  you only have one life you could go down it by going through a boot camp  you could look at codeacademy or  just take a girl develop it class for beginners  start somewhere and i promise the momentum will take you the rest of the way  i took some online courses and gdi classes before i went to hackbright  just getting that little bit of experience is enough to drive you to continue on and finish the journey  i went from what i was doing         aesthetician work at ten dollars an hour a couple days a week         to a great job as an associate application security engineer  it was not an easy journey  i got denied a lot  i interviewed a lot  i got turned down a lot  my path was not paved with open doors  i faced a lot of disappointment in all phases of my journey  it worked out  and i would say don   t get discouraged  just keep going  because it   ll happen words from a techie turned freelance photographer
