this post is part of our series covering the saas industry  subscribe to our medium channel to be kept informed of our next posts churn is probably one of the most documented saas metrics  the aim of this article is not to define and speak about the general concept of churn  you can find plenty of outstanding resources about that  but to analyse   saas benchmarks and see what they say about real churn figures the   benchmarks we   ll analyse are  pacific crest survey  open startups  totango annual saas metrics report and groove saas small business survey  if you know more of them please     clemnt but before digging into the actual numbers i would like to stress on a very important point  before you compare churn numbers you have to clearly define which churn you   re talking about when you see a churn figure you have to ask yourself whether revenue or user  pretty straightforward  in one case you measure the revenue lost from a cohort during a specific time range and in the other the number of paying customers lost from a cohort during that period of time annual or monthly    meaning the churn is measured for a year or a month period  since both are very often used here is a table with monthly churn and its annualised equivalent  i just use the formula  annual churn                         monthly churn      be careful though as you shouldn   t mix monthly plans churn with annual plans churn  different beasts  gross or net churn  probably the trickiest of the    gross revenue churn doesn   t take into account revenue expansion    some users of your cohort can actually end up paying more at the end than at the beginning of the period considered  because they have upgraded their account  while net churn does so it   s totally possible to have a    monthly gross churn and a    monthly net churn  so if you see a    revenue churn alone  without context  it   s hard to compare it with other figures  here is a good post on chartmogul explaining it  and yes with net churn it   s possible to have a negative churn rate now that we   ve made that clear let   s start the    general observations about customer account churn rates by segment    that tomasz tunguz shared are confirmed by    of the benchmarks analysed  we cannot draw any meaningful conclusion from totango survey  hence the    couple of comments after receiving some messages   dm on twitter about this benchmarkconducted by david skok and matrix partners the pacific crest survey is the most complete and detailed benchmark in the saas industry  you won   t find better than this currently  available publicly at least   a must read survey participthe benchmark is based on the answers from     companies so we   re speaking mostly about companies selling software to the enterprise and mid market segments here and probably fewer to smbs customers  especially that in the results underneath the companies with less than     m of revenue are excluded  resultthe   graphs above are very interesting to get a bit more details churn figures knowing that we can infer that these churn results are representative of saas companies targeting mid size   enterprise customers with generally sales   inside salabout this benchmarki   ve basically collected the churn data from the    open    saas companies  except outreach signals which is more an online agency than a saas  benchmark participthese are mainly saas targeting smbs  with a much lower price point  acv and also more early stage companies compared to the pacific crest survey ones resultwe can also notice that revenue churn is higher than customer churn for these companies  it   s the opposite for the pacific crest survey ones conclusthese numbers are interesting because they confirm that at early stage and for a lower price point  saas companies tend to have higher churn rates  user and revenue  compared to enterprise         mid market ones  which was expected about this benchmarktotango is a customer success software  one of their aim is to lower churn  which runs every year a survey among saas companies to benchmark several metrics survey particip       saas professionals    which revenue distribution looks like this     of participants have an arr     m resulta first problem is that the survey doesn   t say clearly whether we   re talking about gross or net revenue churn  since they don   t have negative churn on the graph i infer that it   s gross churn so basically concluswe have unfortunately not enough information about the precise profile of these companies or the distribution of churn by acv to draw real conclusions about this benchmarkin      groove  a customer support software  run a survey to benchmark several saas metrics among small business saas survey particip       respondents who have reached product market fit  have been in business for at least   months and have at least         but less than     k  in monthly recurring revenue    resultagain the problem is that groove doesn   t precise which churn they talk about  revenue  net  gross or user churn   especially that in their survey the question asked was quite open    what is your churn rate     that being said we can infer that it   s monthly user churn  from the context  conclusthe participants of this survey are very similar to the ones from the open startup  around the same acv and mrr  with a lower monthly user churn though        compared to the      of the open startups but again we can only assume that it   s user churn and we don   t really know the methodology used by each company to calculate their churn  so these results should be taken cautiously tomasz tunguz shared a table that shows his    general observations about customer account churn rates by segment   this is also what i regularly see among saas startups  so let   s compare that to our   benchmarks pacific crest survey that   s in line with the          monthly and                customer churn from the table above open startupthat   s in line with the        monthly and                 customer churn from the table above totangowe cannot draw meaningful conclusion here groove surveybig warning as we don   t have enough context and info on what and how the churn rate was calculated  if we pretend it   s coherent and concerns monthly user churn then that   s in line with the        monthly and                 customer churn from the table above so if you are a pre  p m fit and early stage startup  less than     years with paying customers  if you have reached p m fit and that you are running your business for more than   years and research analyst   startup hunter  pointninecapstories from the point  team   portfolio compani
