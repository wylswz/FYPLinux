the dual curv screen galaxy not at last ye samsung skip the and we got to play with it beforehand whil the spec lin up with what we expect the phon real shin through through becaus of design that dual curv is sweet and it softw for ont it seem to shin through becaus of touchw not in spit of it we re back in new york thi novemb for the th edit of our grow focus technolog ev spec a beef up s the phon is larg the sam a the galaxy s s edg with a few extr bel and whistl for it larg screen her ar the key detail unlik last year s not the not ha the sam process and ram a it s sery sibl so we wouldn t expect a hug perform boost thi tim around although that can alway com from softw optim stil ther ar som neat touch gorill glass is suppos to be tim hard to crack than gorill glass and should surv perc of should height m drop onto concret i also apprecy the default gb of stor it s a bit od that the not ha a slight smal battery than the s edg whil sport a larg screen but the not wa already a gre perform with just mah design it s so smal first thing first the new cor blu and ros gold is awesom the pict don t quit do it just and i want thi col opt on al phon you also hav the mor bor standard black silv and gold outsid the us col asid the not is a striking dev to hold it s just so smal i mean obvy not s smal but much smal than any inch phon ha the right to be thi is in part thank to smal bezel us capacit button thank you samsung but lik the s edg bef it the dual curv display is what real lend itself to mak the phon feel smal in hand the edg plu sery is no mor samsung emphas that it work to mak the phon s shap perfect symmet front and back and it giv the phon thi smoo pebbl lik feel whil also provid mor solid purchas in the hand the phon is just mm thick than the not bef it but a ful mm slim from sid to siz and slight short a wel it s a not diff and it mak the phon subst easy to hold and us in on hand thi is crazy when you consid how much mor thi phon is pack than it predecess an extr mah of battery an ir scan a larg camer sens almost camer hump a microsd slot and ip waterproof against oth inch phon it s no competit espec consid the not stil ha to you know fit a styl in ther bas samsung ha mast the art of fit a larg screen into a smal a phon a poss and i wish oth manufact would follow suit tak the not v my inch moto z for inst the lat ha abnorm larg bezel to accommod the innard for it modul connect but stil the diff is striking the company tel me it wa abl to do thi in part by us tough mat sery alumin and gorill glass the lat is a particul reliev giv the dual edg screen is mor lik to mak contact with the ground in cas of a drop the back also us gorill glass thi tim around as a sid not the amol display look a wond a ev but we didn t get a chant to try out the hdr video feat stil that s sur to be a mor tang improv than high resolv vr notwithstand the s pen ha been improv too main thank to a smal grippy tip it s now mm thick which is the sam a a ballpoint pen and half of prevy gen and sil a it may sound at first the waterproof can com in handy for thos tim when you nee to us yo phon in the rain and the wet screen isn t respond to yo touch softw touchw might not be so bad aft al samsung s softw tweak hav got a bad rap with the tech press for clut up the android expery but so far the not s upd touchw is mak a pretty strong cas that stock android may not alway be best android the ui ha been cle up overal with simpl menu that look a littl clos to stock android samsung say it s ev gon through the troubl of match the col of the ui to the cor blu of yo phon the camer ap ha le button now too us swip to access filt and set many us ar sur to apprecy som of the ap streamlining whil the phon stil ha a propriet gallery ap instead of googl photo for good reason thi tim around samsung ha reduc it diff not tak ap from four act memo memo scrapbook s not to just a singl samsung not ap it s mor pow too allow you to blend col lik real paint and support the new pen s ad sensit anoth neat trick you can hov ov text with the s pen to magn it up to or ev inst transl it we re liv in the fut folk the best s pen feat though is an upd to on introduc last year with the not wherea bef you could tak out the s pen and immedy start writ on yo phon without unlock the dev the not on up it with an alway on display that mean yo not ar display perm without hav to turn on the phon to view them which i can see com very in handy for shop list and the lik for the first tim you can us a not phon lik a real notepad and unlik bef you can scroll through to hav an infinit amount of spac to writ not rath than just what fit on yo screen but my favorit new feat is the gif mak the screen capt tool let you select a port of yo display that you want to sav a an anim with the s pen tap record and then sav you can eith sav to yo gallery or shar and you can ev edit the gif fram by fram and set them to diff qual i wil be shar al the gif ir scan an extr tier of sec not a fingerprint replac the ir scan is the flashiest new touch i had my doubt giv it impl in window phon but it s a smart approach her the ir scan is compl the fingerprint scan instead of replac it bas samsung want you to think of it a an altern unlock method when conveny or a second form of auth when you want extr priv for inst fingerprint scan ar sucky when yo hand ar wet and can be hard to access when you re busy carry someth the ir scan ha no such problem and judg by samsung s demonst it work almost a fast the key word her is almost though which is why samsung emphas us the scan a second auth plu the ir scan ha a low fals posit ratio the phon feat a sec fold wher you can stor priv fil a ap which you access us the ir scan you can easy sav naughty priv photo to thi fold us android s shar funct and it ev includ an incognito brows for when you nee to buy yo bae a spec gift that ll com in handy if you re the typ of person who tend to shar password giv fingerprint access to yo famy or partn but would stil lik to keep som thing priv of cours samsung could hav don the sam with a password but thi is fast and we al know how terr peopl ar at choos password by the way the ir scan doesn t work with dead peopl sorry would be homicid thief first impress samsung is off a whol lot of phon in a rel smal pack whil it doesn t hav the very best spec in al sen ther ar phon with big battery or mor ram they re stil top notch and samsung ad som un touch that differenty it from pretty much any manufact and for styl fan lik me samsung continu to be pretty much the on mobl manufact to mak the digit wor it of cours we ll hav to put the phon through it pac to see how long term fact such a perform and battery lif play out but if it s anyth lik the not my favorit phon of combin with an s on of the best phon of then i think it s saf to say samsung wil hav a win on it hand samsung isn t annount pric yet it s up to carry but it is off a purchas promot pre ord and you can get a fre gear
