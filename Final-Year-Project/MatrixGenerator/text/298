the following post was written earlier this year for the george washington university   s center for career services blog   gwcareersuccess as a second semester senior  with graduation just weeks away  i   ve been taking some time to reflect on my entire collegiate experience  to reassess the validity and implications of some of the most significant decisions that i   ve made over these past four years since january  i   ve considered  and re considered  whether or not washington d c  was the appropriate environment for me  whether pursuing my major and minor would benefit me in my desired industry  technology  and specialty  marketing   whether joining my fraternity  sigma phi epsilon  and other students organizations  including the gw hatchet and tedxfoggybottom  were a good use of time  and whether internship programs  at companies like nest and harry   s  would translate into marketable skills and formative  professional experiences concurrently  as a second semester senior  i   ve been repeatedly asked one specific question by parents  faculty  and younger members of the gw community  bearing the knowledge and experiences that you now posses  if you were granted admission today  would you accept it the answer  a confident and resounding    yes     and here   s why   in my experience  gw offers students a unique set of keys with which they can unlock their personal and professional identities  by virtue of sitting at the cultural epicenter of one of the most vibrant  diverse  and influential cities in the world  gw is endowed with a unique ability to present students         oftentimes from rural towns and developing countries         with a    traditional    college experience  married with a genuine taste of what it means to live  and work  in the    real world    it   s rare  stimulating  and  at times  overwhelming  but the opportunity to be a student in a city brimming with all sorts of political  economic  and social opportunity is leaps and bounds more qualifying than the textbook curriculum offered exclusively within the confines of an overpopulated lecture room  or campus quad  as is the case at many other institutions it   s what you do with that opportunity  however  that will determine your propensity for success when i came to gw  i was certain of my desire to enter the technology industry in a marketing business development capacity  and knew that i would need to enroll myself in programs and courses that pertained to these efforts  what i didn   t know  however  was the specific academic path that would facilitate my ability to achieve this goal on advice from my advisor in the columbian college of arts and sciences  i chose not to internally transfer into the school of business in order to pursue a degree in information systems technology  as i had suspected when i accepted my offer in high school  rather  i would remain in the columbian college  with a minor in business administration from the school of business  and pursue the newly developed  and widely praised  organizational sciences program focusing on the means by which organizations  their leaders  and their teams communicate  grow change  and  eventually  succeed  it was a less clear path than the one i had initially anticipated  but the program and its faculty have equipped me with broadly applicable insights and skills that i have been able to successfully employ in extracurricular and  later  professional experiences as indicated  there is no better atmosphere to test and refine your academic acumen than in a student organization  institutions like the sigma phi epsilon  dc alpha  fraternity and the gw hatchet proved to be fertile environments to assess the means by which individuals communicate  collaborate  and challenge one another  their beliefs  and the enveloping organizational culture and structure  as a member  and later vice president of communications  for the dc alpha chapter  i was able to witness and affect the opportunities and threats associated with a large  social organization chock full of rich  philanthropical history and communal norms  and as a board member of the gw hatchet  i witnessed similar circumstances benefit  and plague  the political and economic sustainability of an organization with equally historic precedents  apple and blockbuster  the white house and congress  were no better examples of organizational development  success  and decay than the day to day experiences of being an agent of the greek life and gw media communities the only superior means by which students can prepare for the working world and  more importantly  understand themselves  is by participating in a formal internship program  just three weeks after arriving at gw  i was fortunate enough to happen into one such opportunity at a digital agency called istrategylabs  isl   then located off of dupont circle  it was a heavy dose of serendipity mixed with determination  and it was the single most transformative element of my college career  suddenly  the potential of the    outside world     or what exists off campus  was recognized and my passion and appetite to learn and grow accommodated few bounds  my year and a half at isl helped me land a position at harry   s  the men   s grooming startup in new york city  the following summer  which helped me find a marketing opportunity with the uber dc team when i came back for my junior year  these internship programs equipped me with the skills  experience  and network necessary to further cultivate my marketing and business development proficiencies at nest labs in palo alto this past summer  with tedxfoggybottom today  and  hopefully  so on again  you   re in the cultural capitol of the world and  with that  the single best decision you   ll make as a young professional is to throw yourself in the midst of its chaos and work you way back to order gw  and by extension washington  d c   is the epitome of opportunity  but it   s what you do with that opportunity that will set you apart if you liked this piece  please hit the     button at the bottom of this post  and share it with someone that you think will too  and
