a few weeks ago  i wrote a hot take on the pilot episode of nbc   s big fall family drama  this is us  there   s a lot to say about this series  but i wanted to focus on kate   s storyline  because kate is fat  not like size    fat  but fat fat  fat like me  this is a big deal  literally as well as figuratively  because i don   t see women who are fat like me on television very often  so i had an investment here  a personal one  every time a fat like me woman appears on television  i feel a degree of    entitlement  definitely anxiety  certainly a sense that she is standing out to possible millions of viewers as a symbol of what my life  both internal and external  is like  this is the problem with a general lack of diversity in media  by the way         when you only get a few characters every few years who look like you  those characters are subject to an extraordinary amount of precise criticism from everyone who feels misrepresented so i was critical  what did i say  take us back  lesley from a month ago i stand by this  but having watched the next two episodes  my perspective has evolved a bit  i still think kate the character is a big stack of negative stereotypes about fat people  i know i   ve really gone over the top talking about great chrissy metz is in the role         that   s intentional  she is completely great and we should all be saying this all the time  she makes kate human and relatable  and she gives kate a combination of bravado and vulnerability that puts depth into a role that could have otherwise been heartbreakingly fragile and shallow but there   s something else here as well in the second episode  in one of the series    many flashbacks      s mom rebecca tucks child kate into bed one night  kate is markedly bigger than both her brothers  and we   ve already seen her being given a breakfast of half a cantaloupe with a scoop of cottage cheese while her siblings get fun kid cereal  as rebecca says goodnight  kate volunteers that she ate only fruit today  and i felt something clench hard in my chest  tiny kid kate  looking for parental validation that she is doing it right  she is eating things right  she is going to be the smaller kid her mom wants her to be  rebecca hesitates  and then replies  not defensively  but in an effort at reassurance     you know i just want you to be healthy and happy  right    and i audibly  involuntarily burst out    oh fuck     a convulsion of memory  not an oh fuck of outrage but of recognition  of feeling the deep old pain of my well meaning parents    efforts to make me not be fat  which is what i was  or what i thought i was  or what the kids at school said i was  or what the pediatrician who fixated on the four pounds    overweight    i was at eight years old thought i was  when he put me on my first diet  my well meaning parents  who no doubt are reading this even now  i know you only meant to help  i know you only meant to give me the most perfect life you could  i know it all came from a place of genuine love and caring  and yet it all went so wrong  so wrong  so wrong  and it broke my relationship with food  with my body  and i had to learn how to eat like a normal     healthy    person only as an adult  and i had to learn how to live as a fat person later anyway  because none of it worked  i was always fat  i am fat now  i have never been thin  i never will be  i saw this interaction between a loving parent and a child just desperate to please that parent  to trust their reasons  to become the smaller person they think they have to be  to get that    happiness    that culture tells all of us weight loss will bring  when the complicated truth is that the unhappiness inside us is much deeper than the superficial flesh we   re told to shed like so much uncomfortable baggage  sure  you can lose weight and be happy not to be subject to the myriad challenges of life in a fat body  as well as avoiding the social censure that even the most self assured fat person has to sometimes contend with  but there   s likely a part of you that will also always wonder         aren   t i the same person i was  inside  is it fair or right that people value me more now when it   s only my body that has changed  it   s not fair  it   s not fair  it   s not fair  oh fuck there   s another moment  in the second episode  where adult kate is dragged onto a dance floor at a hollywood party by the irrepressible manic pixie dream fat guy toby  and while he cuts loose she freezes under the looks of the people nearby  watching them watching her  seeing herself through their eyes  but not through their eyes  through her own lens of embarrassment and shame  they laugh with each other  some of them make eye contact  others do not  and this moment is brilliantly managed because the subtext is that we aren   t actually sure that these people are gawking at kate  or if they   re even aware of her         but kate thinks they are  and again  oh fuck  because that is a feeling i know and remember  that feeling where you don   t know if someone is laughing at you  you tell yourself you don   t know they are but you realize they might be because sometimes that is the truth these are moments i connect to as part of my past         they   re not feelings i like to remember  they   re also part of my present  because no matter how radically accepting my fat ass might be  no matter how confident  how bulletproof  there will always be somebody who will think they   re entitled to point and laugh at me  and that   s a real thing i have to face in my life from time to time  and i can   t stop that  this is often just a part of fat experience  past  present  and future but i was surprised  in the week following the pilot  when there was so much backlash to the negative stereotypes around kate  i thought people would just accept this sad fat character as gospel truth  that this is what all fat people are like  instead  from twitter to salon  lots of folks called out what they saw as harmful tropes  metz herself responded thoughtfully to the criticism in metz   s and this is us   s defense  this is a story that should be told  because as much as i hate that millions         millions  fucking millions  it kills me how many millions         of fat women are filled with self loathing and despair virtually every moment of their lives because they exist in a culture that tells them they are garbage  as much as i rage against this and work to dismantle the forces that create these circumstances         these are fucking true things  yes  i want to see fat characters where fatness is incidental and not a plot point  i want to see so many fat characters that it   s not even a thing people notice anymore  but i also don   t want people to assume that being fat in a fat loathing culture isn   t occasionally difficult  and that fat people who survive and learn to shine in this world anyway aren   t some of the strongest people you   ll ever meet  because they are  anyone who overcomes this many messages telling them they are less worthy of human respect and dignity  anyone who climbs through that ideology to carry themselves out into the world every day without shame or apology  that   s an incredibly strong person  i am an incredibly strong person  chrissy metz is an incredibly strong person  marianne kirby  gabi gregg  meghan tonjes  jes baker  ariel woodson  corissa enneking and so many more extraordinary  stereotype busting fat women are all incredibly strong people i just want kate to be one of them too  i may not get my way on this  i may have to wait for that to happen  as this is us   s story expands i do see where kate   s story  even when it has been offensively reductive  is still something worth sharing  because there are a lot of kates in the world and not all of them have the resources or motivation to be different  i can   t erase the kates  as much as i   d selfishly like to  because under different circumstances  that might still be me  and wouldn   t i still want my story to be told  then  wouldn   t i still be worth seeing even if i did not overcome the bullshit that i have  we don   t win by erasing the stories that are undesirable  we move forward by acknowledging the variety of human experience and working to break down the forces that make some of us hate ourselves  i may not connect with kate   s story now  i may look at her desperation to lose weight and feel exasperated  but she may not be for me  she is sharing something that lots of people need to understand better if we are ever going to build a world where these stereotypes cease to exist so i can wait  i   ll have to taking my indoor voice outside
