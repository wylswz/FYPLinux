what the hell is wrong with us i watched the debate last night  and frankly  i could have written this post before i wasted my time  i bounced back and forth between disagreeing and agreeing with aspects of what both of them said  the problem is this  even when i found myself agreeing with what was said  i didn   t actually believe it  it just felt like kabuki theatre  at this point  do you think that they even believe themselves i will let others in the media pick apart all the inconsistencies         what each of them wore  which candidate sounded more presidential and who ultimately won  i can   t imagine there will be any surprises as i suspect most of the media outlets picked the winner long before the broadcast began  too cynical  maybe  but if a recent pew research study is to be believed  my cynicism regarding the media is shared by a majority of the country it is well known at this point that politics has become a team sport  i have a post coming on that topic   but what i saw last night brought to mind the gladiator games of ancient rome  not because it was a death match  but because the whole spectacle of it seems to be aimed at distracting us from the real issues we are facing as a country both of these candidates are playing an old game  they are so entrenched in doing battle over the details that they   re losing sight of the war  yes  some of the details are important  but at no point in the debate was there an acknowledgement that there is more to this election than the same tired  rehashed topics of the past year  birthers  emails  isis  stamina  tax returns  etc these candidates  and their respective parties  are dinosaurs when did    your team is worse than mine    become the prevailing motive in our country for engaging in the democratic process  how many people are truly for their candidate as opposed to being against the candidate from the    other side    listen to this clip from bono  his perspective on america is so powerful and clear  bono  if you happen to read this  i would love to talk with you again  on or off the air  as a foreigner  it   s possible that bono is able to see america more objectively  which may allow him to more accurately assess america   s greatness  but i can   t help but think that it   s a sad state of affairs when the clearest  most salient voice on the value of america isn   t coming from an american citizen  let alone the next president the idea of america has been bastardized it is not about owning a home  two cars and a white picket fence  it is not about retiring with a nice little nest egg and a gold watch  it is not about healthcare  it is not about anything the next president spoke about or even seemed to understand  america is an idea  it is a simple idea  but one that had never been tried before  a government created by the people for the people  a government where the people decide who would govern them and not the other way around in the words of william wallace     freeeeedom    america is far from perfect  we need to improve  but if our history has taught us anything  it   s that more freedom leads to far better outcomes than less freedom  that said  freedom  in and of itself  will not lead to utopia we will continue to fight wars the economy will again suffer recessions and  god forbid  depressions there will continue to be violent crimes and riots in the streets terrorism will not go away there will be tough times ahead  but we will always overcome if we remember  as simon sinek would say  our    why    america is great because the idea of america is perfect  not because the world uses the dollar as the reserve currency  for now  or because we have the largest and most powerful military  america won   t be great if it moves to a single payer healthcare system or increases the federal minimum wage  each of these may make america incrementally better or worse  to each their own  but it will all be for naught if we lose sight of what america is for more years than i can count  i have been learning and trying to teach our history  the founders  the constitution  the rise of progressivism  etc  but the longer i live through this kakistocracy  i find that at times i am fighting more to preserve the map our founders bestowed upon us rather than the idea itself  even as a constitutionalist  i find that it   s easy to forget that the constitution is not the end  but the means  we need to focus on our    why    before we focus on the how i have profound admiration for our founders  i think the constitution is one of the greatest  if not the greatest  document penned by man  i believe the balance between a democracy and a republic and the checks and balances of our three branches of government were inspired  but these things are not the ends  just the means  we speak about the constitution being a check on the government  but why to protect our freedom  nothing more  nothing less if    we the people    want to amend our founding document in order to provide more freedom  let   s have that conversation  but it has to start with a fundamental understanding of the ideal  there are many smarter than i who may have ideas for how it might be improved         i certainly don   t  which is why i choose to defend the constitution  but i look forward to hearing and engaging in that conversation  unfortunately  that   s not the conversation the candidates  or the media for that matter  have been engaged in during this election cycle  last night was no exception but don   t worry  i   m sure it was the other side   s fault  when times are tough  just point the finger across the aisle  right  when our team wins  we get to enjoy a brief endorphin rush and then  four years later  we get to battle it out all over again  and again    and again    we   re fighting the battles but we   ve all but forgotten why we waged the war the debate only confirmed what i   ve come to fear the most  that in the fog of our partisan battles  we have lost sight of the idea of america         our north star  and without it  we seem to be losing our dignity  our ability to reason  our principles  our empathy  even our basic decency  i wonder how many of us have noticed  i wonder how many people care as rome is burning  our politicians boldly declare    let them eat cake     my apologies for mixing metaphors  find joy  speak truth    http   www glennbeck com   http   theblaze com
