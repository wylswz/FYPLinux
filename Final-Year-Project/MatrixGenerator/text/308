self care is becoming a buzzword in today   s society  for good reasons  but good methods of implementation are not often discussed  people will tell you how great meditation is and how much it can benefit you but we rarely get a how to guide that is applicable to our life you   ve probably made a list of self care initiatives you were going to take and let them go straight to shit  you might blame yourself  feel resentful or just think that maybe  it   s not for you  if that   s the case  i believe you   re wrong  the reason why you haven   t been taking care of yourself is energy do you notice that when you feel well and energized your willpower increases  energy is the key to everything  in this case  it   s key to completing everything you want to do as human beings  we get our energy from our food  supplements  mindset and our environment  our current diet of poor food  poor mindset and harmful environment plays a big part in our lack of self control  when your body  more specifically  your brain is well nourished it has a great impact on your life  giving our brain healthy complete  dha epa  fats not only boosts your mood  but it boosts your will power and your overall awareness i   ll discuss this topic more rigorously in the future but for now here   s what you can do to increase your overall energy other than sunlight and sources of omega     s  all these methods are supplements  the reason behind that is their ease of use  you might not have the energy of feel the need to switch up your diet but popping a couple pills  eating some food or being outside is pretty easy sunlight vitamin d  vitamin d isn   t just the most important supplement         it is possibly the most important biohack  vitamin d acts on over      different genes and serves as a substrate for sex hormones like testosterone  human growth hormone  and estrogen  it moderates immune function and inflammation  it assists in calcium metabolism and bone formation  it   s no coincidence this is one of the few vitamins humans can make on their own  without it         we   d be dead  it   s true that you can get adequate vitamin d from sun exposure  but for non nudist non equatorial dwellers it   s not enough  if you   re getting adequate vitamin a  it   s almost impossible to overdose on d dose       iu      pounds of body weight  form  d time taken  mornrecommended brand  jarrow formulas d omega     s and other healthy fats before we get into the supplement form  here   s a list of edible ways to get healthy fats  i know  from personal experience  that buying a bunch of supplements can get fucking expensive  especially  when you   re taking more a high variety  if you follow me on my personal twitter  or just pay attention to my timeline you   ve probably seen this picture  i   ll get more into grass fed butter and it   s benefits when i delve into the nutrition side of things epa dha  krill oil this is a tricky one  small doses of high quality fish oil reduce inflammation  improve brain function  and even enhance muscle growth  but poor quality or high doses can cause more problems than they help to solve  not all fish oil is created equal  most of the brands you are likely to buy at your local grocery are contaminated  oxidized  and low potency  if you can   t find a good fish oil         you   re much better off avoiding it all together that   s why i recommend krill oil over fish oil altogether  krill is more stable and it is phosphorylated  meaning it   s easier for your brain to use  it also comes with astaxanthin  a potent antioxidant there are real benefits to taking epa and dha  but most of these are strongest if your diet is deficient in omega     s  or too high in omega     s  if you   re eating a bulletproof diet  this won   t be a problem  humans only need    mg of dha and epa a day to have optimal brain function  if you   re eating grass fed meat and wild caught fish  this is easily obtainable  if you can   t find grass fed meat or wild caught seafood  you should supplement with at least     mg of krill oil per day dose      mg   dayforms  krill oiltime taken  with meals recommended brand  jarrow krill oilvitamin cthis is one of the safest  most effect supplements you can take  vitamin c is needed for collagen and connective tissue formation  it   s used to manufacture glutathione  the most powerful antioxidant in the body  vitamin c can enhance immune function and help quench free radical damage  studies have shown you can take up to     grams of vitamin c a day with no side effects  besides loose stool  it   s hard to get enough vitamin c from food  which is why    percent of the population is deficient some fruits and vegetables are high in vitamin c  but cooking and storage methods can deplete vitamin c content  supplementation with at least    mg per day is optimal  you should take a lot more if you are suffering from chronic infections or healing from injury dose        grams   dayforms  ascorbic acid crystals or time release capsules time taken  morning and evening  but it   s best not to take it after a workout as isolated antioxidants can negate the insulin sensitivity gained from exercise vitamin athis is essential if you aren   t eating organ meats like beef liver  kidney  and heart  you should   vitamin a is an important cofactor for numerous metabolic reactions and bodily functions  a quarter of americans consume less than half the rda  which is already too low  an important thing to remember is that you can   t get vitamin a from plants  plants don   t have vitamin a  they have beta carotene  beta carotene is poorly converted into vitamin a which is why some populations develop vitamin a deficiency despite consuming far more than they should have required  sorry vegetarians and vegans  carrots don   t count dose                  iu   day forms  retinol  a good source of vitamin a is cod liver oil  which also has vitamin d time taken  with meals recommended brand  green pasture fermented cod liver oil  arctic mint flavor source for all the vitamins information and dosage  p s  i take literally everything on that page  except the copper  when my pockets can take it  dave asprey is definitely one of the reasons why i   ve decided to do this and he has thought me a lot since i discovered his brand two summers ago tweet this to him now to the heart of the cause  self care doesn   t always have to be difficult  it   s not actually supposed to feel like a chore or another task on your list  use it as a way to balance yourself  clear your energy and grow the simple act of writing your thoughts out allows you to step out of situations and gain better perspective in any given situation  personally  it also allows me to express myself clearly and release thoughts that have been running on my mind for too long tip  make sure a journal and pen is next to or even on your bed at all times  it makes it way easier to journal if you don   t have to fish it out of your desk or your bedside table gratitudes are like the best thing ever  you can shift your mindset at the flip of the dime with them  they   re great for living out of a place of love  after you journal  write down    things you   re grateful for and not in the superficial way  write down what you are thankful for and why example  i   m thankful for healthy food  toxin free supplements and sun because they energize me and help me remain balanced and focused throughout my journey affirmations are the key to mind  we learn by repeating something over and over so it   s only right we use that to our advantage  you can tailor your own affirmations  google them  get some from thatgirlhas on twitter  they   re fire  or a combination of all three i suggest putting them up on your wall  your bathroom mirror or on your work desk  just make sure they   re visible to you in the morning  it   ll make reciting them everything easier cc  how to reprogram your subconscimeditation is the key to life  especially in this fast pace age of high potential distractions  it allows us to focus and remain relaxed and balanced i started out meditating with these guided meditations  since then  i   ve discovered davidji   s official soundcloud page where you can find guided meditations for any intention  from chakra specific meditations  to letting go of ailments and stepping into the unknown  there   s something on here for you i believe candle meditations are great if you don   t already meditate  i understand why it might feel weird to close your eyes and just sit there at first  they are a great alternative  they also clear clean your vision which is a plus in our digital age for the candle meditation  stand about       feet away from the flame and look at it  don   t stare but look at it until whatever timer you have set up is done you can also do the candle meditation with a guided meditation in the background to slowly ease yourself into it  i usually mirror myself when i do this  it   s not necessary bonus  mirror meditfocus on your breath and look in the mirror  now look at yourself from your reflection so you feel like your reflection is looking at you p s  i   ve done this on psychs before and it was wild disclaimer  i   m not advising you to do that forest bathing sunbathin the previous post  we discussed the benefits of sunlight  similar benefits can be found when spending time in nature  you can also benefit from walking barefoot and intentionally visualizing the energy you want to get rid of being transmuted into the ground bonus  salt bathtaking a salt bath is a great way to clear your energy field  just soaking in there until the water turns cold  while reading a book and or listening to music can positively affect your week in a great way  stay in the bath as you drain it and visualize the negative energy going through the drain and back into the soil blue light blockthis is an easy way to greatly impact your life  blue sources of light at night throw off your circadian rhythm  this can cause insomnia  higher risks of cancer  fatigue and more  read the post below for more informcc  how blue lights affect you and what you can choose to do about itbinaural beatthis is the simplest way to alter your brainwaves and shift them to a desired brain state  throw in some headphones  press play and that   s it  these beats emit slightly different frequencies on each ear and create a wave in your brain which create a specify frequency i   ve been using this beat for like two years  i   m actually listening to it as i   m writing this  you can peruse the internet and find some just about anywhere though  sonic yogi on soundcloud is the source of most of mine conscious breathing awarthis might be the most obvious one but it   s the most overlooked  simply breathing deeply with awareness throughout your day will shift everything put a red wristband on your left wrist or anything really and associate it with breathing deeply  when you notice your breath isn   t flowing take a couple  slow deep breaths  you can even use the box breathing method  breath in for    keep it in for    breath out for    hold it out for    this will calm your nervous system and help you enjoy every second of your existence special tip  energy controls everything  as
