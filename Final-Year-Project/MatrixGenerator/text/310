original interview  http   www techiesproject com ash huang so  let   s start at the beginning  tell me about your early years and where you come from i used to be resentful about growing up in connecticut  but as i get older  i think i become more and more connecticut y  it was a very puritan  affluent  seat of the american revolution type of town  and my siblings and i were the token asian kids in all of our classes  this one time in history class  we were talking about charlemagne or something  and the teacher said     did you know that everyone of european descent is actually related to charlemagne     and everyone in the class just turned around and looked at me  so unsurprisingly  i didn   t really feel like a part of the community my parents both worked  i didn   t really think anything of it when i was growing up  but i had a lot of time to myself  there was this expectation from my parents     we   re not going to entertain you  you have to entertain yourself  go to school and get good grades  do your own thing     i drew a lot  wrote little stories  all the kid things  in high school  i was super into smudgy digital paintings of fantasy things and making weird emo websites when did you first get really interested in tech  or did you not get interested until you were kind of in it i was always into it  i think  but i didn   t know it  my dad encouraged me to code sites  when i was    or    i was making neopets fansites and things like that  in high school i had this realization that it wasn   t something girls were    supposed    to do  there was this message floating around     you   re a geek girl  you built your own computer     i just did it for fun  from there i thought     well  i must be a tomboy     and that became part of my identity  in retrospect it   s very disturbing     i   m a non girl  i don   t have girl friends  i   m one of the guys  i am literally not a woman  because women don   t build things     i didn   t realize how problematic this was until i was in my twenties from there  i went to carnegie mellon   s design school  which was great  we had a lot of female professors that we respected and my class had a good mix of genders and at least some diversity so from there you started in advertising i did  advertising is a weird beast yeah  i have friends who have transitioned from ads to tech  too  they told me about the ad years  which sound way rougher  honestly i think everything is just less hidden  i think things are more     welp  it   s going to be like this  and that   s the way it is     there   s some truth to the mad men stereotype  the glorification  the partying  using client dollars and working yourself into a stupor yeah  i think i saw in the news         a girl in singapore that worked three days straight and died of heart failure  she was like     you know  a copywriter it   s so not worth it  but you think  this is what i have to do to get ahead walk me through the path from agency to tech to independence in short  i saw what they charged for me and what they were paying me  this was probably true at any creative agency of that era  not only were they paying me a quarter of what they were charging for me  but they were also lying about there being x numbers of designers on the project  it was just me  i thought  maybe i should just do this on my own  even if i can get only a few clients  if i charged half of what they were charging  i could make a living  at that point  i wasn   t used to making a ton of money anyway i graduated during the recession  so i know what it   s like not to be able to get a job  i sent out over sixty applications trying to get my first gig  and only ended up getting requests to interview from two people  this is after attending a great university with a string of internships under my belt  i was ready after graduation to work as a barista or a librarian to move to san francisco  so i was still up for that as a last resort so this was my first pass at going independent  i had no idea what i was doing  but even with my then paltry san francisco connections  i carved out a living i was posting on dribbble a lot  and one day mark otto  who was at twitter at the time  said     hey  why don   t you come have lunch     i still love twitter and use it a lot  everyone seemed super nice  and it would be a prestigious place to work  so it checked all the boxes  i stayed for about a year  doing brand and marketing design  the company grew from     to      people while i was there  which started to feel too big that   s when i started peeking over at pinterest  it was just    people when i joined  what really attracted me was the userbase  which was not a typical techie first audience  it was people who had jobs outside of silicon valley  who lived all across the country  and had families and other aspirations  the ethos of the company felt really homey  where we   d unironically make valentines for each other  i always wanted to go independent again  but i figured i   d stay at pinterest for   years as my last gig  then  they grew to     people in the space of two years  which was even more stressful than when twitter grew  i could only take two years of hypergrowth before i had to leave i   ve been independent for about two years now what are the things that were really exciting that you took away from your time working in house  and then what was not so great i met so many good people working full time  it   s one of my fantasies to move to the middle of nowhere and have a crazy farm  but it   s hard to leave the bay area because i know so many awesome people  i do feel like for all its faults there   s a great community out here  especially a female community  which is something i   ve needed and cherish there   s a lot of stuff i didn   t love  too  by the end of my full time adventures  i was having health problems  things i   d never experienced before  i had full body rashes and new allergies  i was constantly getting sick to the point of being bedridden  and doctors couldn   t figure out what was going on  i don   t have any of these problems today  it   s as if my body was like  nope  you   ve got to chill the fuck out throughout my life  i   ve always wanted to seek creative criticism and wanted to get to the next level  but i never doubted myself  my early   s and mid twenties was all doubt  though  when i was leaving full time work  i was evaluating if i should even stay in design  i was ready to quit the industry  quit being a designer because i   d become convinced that i was not good enough to hack it  i wasn   t producing good work  it was like in sports  i had the yips  it   s really depressing looking back on that era  because i know now that there   s so much out there for me  i   m glad i got out when i did i felt similarly in my work in tech  and actually my best friend worked at a big agency where she was an art director  just killing it working on huge global brands  confidence through the roof  and then she moved to tech  where i met her at my tiny little startup  and i watched our young  inexperienced bosses just destroy her confidence and it   s never really come back even though she   s worked at better and better jobs and does incredible work  and i just still see her not fully believe in her work  even though i   m like    look at what you   re making     you know  and i   m like  what did tech do to her to make her feel that way it   s still a bit of a mystery to me  when i left i had this realization that i was internalizing a lot of things  one example is how old i look  i   m almost     but lyft drivers will ask me if i   m headed to class  a worker at the dmv asked if i was there to take the driving test  i   m sure i   ll be happy about this when i   m older  but it   s easy to feel like my face is betraying me i realized it wasn   t my face betraying me  though  it   s my face  it can   t do such a thing  part of being independent meant i could stop feeling like i was fighting others    notions of me  that i could stop fighting my own face there   s a lot i can   t and wouldn   t change about myself or the way i look  and i want to spend my time solving problems and telling stories  rather than figuring out ways to keep people from being mistaken  offended or threatened by my mere existence  i got so sick of thinking     oh  if i dressed exceptionally well  but not too well   people wouldn   t discount my opinions  if i smile the right amount  but not too much   if i use enough emojis in my emails    yeah  you wrote a medium post highlighting some of your experiences in tech  and that resonated with quite a few people  including myself  for those who haven   t read it  who will read this  walk me through some of those experiences when i was debating whether or not to leave tech altogether  i was so jaded  i spent about a year being totally burned out  i couldn   t even click on links about    woman sues x for discrimination    or    x scandal    because they would make me so angry  but tech keeps drawing me back in  because of that same attitude i had as a kid  where i didn   t know i was interested in tech  i just wanted to make cool stuff  to express myself  to be heard  tech is not the point  people are the point  and tech   s supposed to be in service of people  i   m so looking forward to the day when teens are making one use apps that are like  beyonce lyrics and things like that  the things we see as deeply technical are going to get more democratic and more accessible until they become as common as shooting off an email  that   s my hope in the meantime  i   ve sort of given up the idea that i can succeed in a traditional tech role  i   m sure a job is out there for me  but it   s not going to be in the majority  it doesn   t make much sense for me to look  statistics not being on my side  especially when i can carve out my own business and feel like i have power again i think you can probably relate  where one of my biggest issues was feeling like i didn   t have any runway  and just knowing the work that i could do if i was allowed  and not being able to perform in a way that would have been good for the company  i felt like i was constantly being kept in a box and prevented from helping in significant ways it   s like there   s a code you can   t crack  i   d see a problem  see a way forward  a way to get it done  but then i would come up against friction     you have to do this list of process to get that done     so  i   d do those things and then the response would be     you follow the rules too much  why can   t you just take initiative and do it     so  i   d break the rules  usually emulating male coworkers  and then suddenly i   m branded a troublesome employee  at that point  the game is rigged  isn   t it  there   s no path forward  to the point where i   d ask     would it be better for me to do nothing     and i kid you not  the answer was sometimes     that   s probably for the best    this didn   t work for me  i   m genuinely curious if it would work for anyone  i was a very bossy  stubborn child  i was always raising my hand in class in the front row  i was that girl  but after this slow draining  this slow reward after reward for being malleable and feeble  i was becoming one of those people who were averse to conflict for the sake of appearing easy to deal with for you  was it mostly just the sum of a thousand paper cuts  or was there like a moment when you were like     ok  here   s my plan on getting out     i had this story in my head that i was just an unhappy  ungrateful person  that even if i had the world  i   d still be a grouchy  angry person who wouldn   t be able to sleep at night  it had been building for a while  but i think i woke up one day and thought  this is not sustainable  i have everything  and i   m wasting it  two generations ago  my family was fleeing war and hiding in haybales  getting bayonetted at by soldiers  for me not to take the leap when i could does nobody honor so how much of that has resolved for you working as a freelancer it changed so quickly  of course i had moments where i was insecure  where i worried that no one would want to work with me  where i thought the money would dry up  instead  i found that there were really loving  enthusiastic people out there who just wanted to make stuff together  it was a revival for me  a restoration of faith  my work immediately improved  it was such a relief it   s such a bummer that so many people can go from extremely confident people and end up in an environment where we are turned into people who don   t feel valid whatsoever  end up having to repair it ourselves on our own  and then end up thriving it   s a self fulfilling cycle  when someone says     i don   t have faith in you     people would be surprised constantly at my age  my experience  and i realized they were making all of these underlying assumptions about me  there would be people who were like     oh  ash is so sweet     and i was like     whoa  that   s an adjective a mother or boyfriend should be using  not you  coworker  besides  did you not see all the instagrams i took in the cemetery  all the black i wear     to undo all those assumptions is a whole    nother job i had managers call me sweetheart when they weren   t thinking  off the cuff  i   ve had people scold me for writing emails that were not strongly worded in the least  i   ve had people tell me not to go to company sponsored classes because i   d be    in over my head     that i    didn   t have enough experience     and then i   d see a bunch of men there that were way less experienced at coding than i was  i would have managers not tell me important information because of some virtuous paternalism  and then it would limit my ability to do my job  and that would result in people labeling me incompetent  junior  thinking     maybe there   s a reason we don   t tell her everything    people don   t do it out of malice  almost all of these people are nice humans  they have families and will smile when you talk to them  it   s just all these assumptions they don   t realize they are making which slowly wear away at women   s reputations did you have any mentors in the industry or people that inspired you on the positive end my first job  i worked with a badass art director  christina rinaldi  she was my first example of what being a working woman could mean  she was first and foremost a great designer  so creative  but she was short like me and wore heels  she never tried to hide the fact that she was female now i feel fortunate that i   m surrounded by lots of awesome women  my friend alice lee uses the term    friendtors     i have this loving coven around me  i   ve had male mentors as well  which i think is important  i don   t think a lot of men naturally gravitate towards mentoring women  but in this climate it can be hard to find a female mentor what do your friends and family from home feel about the work that you   ve done there are few people i   m friends with from high school still  but i   m in a pretty different place now than i was back then  my parents i think are just pleased i   m self sufficient  they try to be supportive  but i do think they wonder what i do every day  my dad came to my senior project at school and looked around at our work  he said     there is some theme here  but i don   t know what it is    i   m always curious to know the secret sauce or the common trait that allows people to start their own thing  which is absolutely not what most people want to do  what do you think that is for you i can   t say for sure  i   m pretty stubborn  which helps  i think for me  i just want to be free  i want to solve problems and tell stories without all the man made conflict  there   s a lot of that personality in silicon valley  the one that gets a little kick out of debate club  of watching people squirm and setting stuff on proverbial fire  i   ve turned into a giant california hippie  i   m into the idea of cooperation i think the other thing is that i   m actually scared and embarrassed most of the time  like  i have this phobia that my phone is going to bounce into a sewer grate twenty feet away when i   m holding it  i   ve slipped on banana peels and run into glass doors  that constant state of anxiety is a blessing  though  because when i get scared of running my own business  it   s kind of just another fear for the pile how do you feel about the state of tech right now if someone else tells me tech is a meritocracy  i   m going to fucking scream  i think there   s a lot more awareness that we   re all biased and raised to be racists  even  maybe especially  minorities  and i think the goal of talking about it is to just be more mindful  no need to be perfect  just be aware and try not to do nasty stuff  apologize when you   re hurtful  but some people are still so defensive about it  you can say     hey  that was kind of misogynist  please don   t say that     and the response is     i   m not a misogynist      and that totally derails an expression of discomfort into a cosmic  immovable perception of someone   s ego  which was not the point  it   s like saying     you   re standing on my foot     and the other person saying     i   m not fat    wouldn   t you want to be told  i think it   s so ironic  tech is always asking for quantitative affirmation  for data  but the data that says diverse companies do better is ignored  i   m an optimist  though  the way things are going  if you   re going to ignore inclusivity  you   re going to be a dinosaur in a few years and the diverse companies are going to crush you  i guess we   ll see you left the industry as did i  there is so much conversation around pipeline  but not many people talk about retention  what do you think tech could do to not lose more talent that   s a hard one  because the only way i could figure out how to work in tech and not have my creativity destroyed was to exist on the fringes  number one  we need more diverse founders  i saw some sad statistic recently that women founded companies make up a single digit percentage of companies funded here  there are plenty of female entrepreneurs who don   t do things tech finds glamorous  fashion bloggers  youtube stars  self help gurus  so the idea that this is a meritocracy and that women just aren   t interested in being entrepreneurial is ridiculous i think we also need to put our monies where our mouths are and be open to criticism and dialogue  again  it   s just so deeply ironic         people will seek out user feedback and try to get people to bash their apps so they can improve them  but then shrug off any critique on how their company about page is a wall of young white men the other thing i   m doing right now that feels more subversive is making things for the female gaze rather than the male gaze  so not everything has to be a stoic flag on a hill  just be better humans day to day  or try to be have you seen your personality change since you went independent yeah  i feel more like myself  now if i don   t want to do something  i   m pretty clear about it  to the point where i   ll surprise myself  like  i didn   t know i had an opinion on that  i don   t put   emoticons in every single email  i still put them in because i like them and think they   re funny  but not to seem cute or innocuous  i   m a lot better with boundaries  i won   t check email on weekends         well  i shouldn   t say never  sometimes it   s necessary  but if so  someone   s going to pay oprah dollars for that time honestly i feel    years younger people see me and they say  you look great  i   m just like  god  what did i look like before covered in rashes blotchy and sad where do you see yourself in   or    years i   m really enjoying my life right now  i would love to get to a place where i   m doing only independent projects of all kinds  i   ve always been one of those people who   s been interested in    things at once  which i think is sometimes punished in full time work     oh  you   re erratic  you can   t focus     and it   s less about focus than multi tasking  i want to build apps  i want to keep publishing books  and it all seems possible what advice would you give folks who have had similar experiences to you in tech or even just girls hoping to get into tech that   s a big one  one thing is that most of the women i know have gone through this deep experience  almost a second  older adolescence where they figure out what they actually want  versus what they are told is desirable  everyone was pushing me into management  i did not want to stop making things  but people would say     oh  you have a caring air about you     and other bullshit like that  or get overly excited if i said i wanted to mentor someone in the company  i think people are very quick to tell women what they want and shouldn   t want  taking the time to outline what it is you as an individual want is so important  it will probably confuse people  when i left pinterest  some random guy i knew in high school literally commented    noooooooo     on my announcement  but if you know it   s what you want  it won   t bother you so much words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice coman ongoing series documenting the stories of underrepresented people in
