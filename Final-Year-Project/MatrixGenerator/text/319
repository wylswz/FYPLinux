   there   s poop on the walls again    that image of my childhood is forever going to be synonymous with autism and my brother  caleb  he was born in       just two short years after me  from his first breath  he struggled  newborns are born with life dependent primitive reflexes  one of which is the ability to suck so that they can nurse  my brother had to stay in the hospital after my mother was discharged  he couldn   t seem to get the hang of it after a shaky start  he did okay for a while  in fact  you might say that he did more than okay  he walked at nine months  which was actually quite unsettling for my mother  a nine month old is a very small baby to be on foot  and she had planned on having a few more months before she   d have two kids under the age of five to chase for caleb  the regressive symptoms of autism came just on time  before age two  he seemed to lose developmental milestones  he wasn   t talking  though he could spell things out with blocks and would routinely do math on a magnetic drawing board that he took everywhere  the world seemed to assault caleb constantly  everything was too loud  too bright  he wasn   t an affectionate child  he didn   t want to be hugged or kissed  what calmed him was lying on the bed for hours  motionless  watching the numbers of the digital clock change this was his idea of peace he did not potty train on schedule  instead  he had somewhat of an intense penchant for smearing feces all over the rug and walls of the house  this was his way of saying     no  i   m not ready yet     he couldn   t tell anyone he had pants full of shit  within a few short years  he did figure out how to get his own pull ups when he had to poop  his relationship to the toilet had nothing to do with his bodily needs  the toilet was his method of rejecting objects  if he didn   t want something  he   d flush it  it took a little while for my mother to catch on  she figured he was acting out by flushing his pacifier  so she kept replacing it  he kept doing it  finally  she figured out he didn   t want it   and he couldn   t tell her that  so he came up with a clever  albeit expensive  way to show it  eventually  he learned how to convey distaste in a way that didn   t compromise our septic tank  by the time he entered school he was  thankfully  potty trained he was only aggressive in the sense that  when startled or overwhelmed  he would kick and scream  they started out seeming like normal tantrums  but while most kids could be consoled  caleb could not be  and he would have to literally wear himself down before he would stop  for hours  he screamed  kicked  punched   it was painful to witness  even as a child  because it wasn   t like he was doing it because he was a brat  he was living in a world that he didn   t understand and couldn   t communicate with  as hard as it was for all of us to listen to him  we couldn   t blame him  at this point  we had no idea what was    wrong    with him  there were times when my mother would have to hold him down and douse him with cold water  just to    shock    him out of what she described as almost a seizure  his tantrums seemed to overtake him physically and emotionally  after  he was lethargic and almost sedated sometimes  he would have two or three    meltdowns    a day early on  he didn   t respond to noise  you could scream his name and he wouldn   t look up  my mother used to stand behind him when he was just a toddler and bang pots and pans furiously  begging him to react to something  this made us wonder if he was deaf  but all it took was a simple hearing test to rule that out  when he was around two  and had an initial comprehension evaluation  my parents were disheartened to hear that he had only tested at the level of nine months old unrelated to the autism  but something that made his life all the more difficult  was that he had terrible vision  he got glasses very young  and there   s a chance his vision could have improved if his eye could have been patched  but for kids with autism  tactile experience can cause rages  and he couldn   t have kept an eyepatch on for three seconds  let alone the time it would take to rewire his brain  although he wouldn   t have an official autism diagnosis until he was seven years old  as a small child the pediatrician was aware he was not meeting his milestones  particularly verbal ones  they called it    apraxia    and he had speech therapy right up until he started school  not having any    real    diagnosis  though  wildly compromised his ability to get any services not that there were many to be had  though there weren   t really many voices in the autism community when caleb was little  it hadn   t yet become a    cause     nor was it featured in the news or even celebrity gossip  everyone who knew us knew that caleb was different  once he started school  the nightmare only intensified  i say that not to describe what life was like for us  but for him  school  with its unpredictable nature and constant social interaction  its lack of structure for kids who needed anything other than    normative learning     the truth was  caleb wasn   t really special needs  he was extremely intelligent  rain man  yeah  you bet  that   s pretty accurate  caleb   s mental processing ability was far superior to most  but his social skills  common sense and basic ability to complete activities of daily living were virtually nonexistent  it was these things  of course  that were the focus  public school has its limitations  and to start out  it was difficult because of his frustration  i would routinely be called out of class to try to calm him down  my mother always had to pick him up because he would be inconsolable and disrupting class  by now  he was talking  but he was predominantly    parroting     that is  repeating phrases he had heard on tv  or from me and my parents  this got him into a little trouble  the thing about autism and echolalia  as it   s called  is that he did have some concept of when he should repeat a certain phrase  he could parrot with context  and even though it   s sort of against what we think of when we think about the autistic mind  caleb was capable of being very funny  i would even go so far as to say witty once  when he was in the first grade  he was frustrated by his male teacher and there was  of course  a tantrum  the teacher was so overwhelmed that he needed back up and headed for the door to ask the teacher across the hall to help  thinking  i imagine  that he was walking away from the situation entirely  my brother yelled at him just as he passed the threshold he was six years old there were other far less amusing occasions  my mother can recall having to come pick him up when he was in kindergarten because he had taken off all his clothes  the teacher had locked him in the bathroom  taken all the kids out of the room  and basically barricaded him in there until she showed up needless to say  she was not pleased with their solution to the problem it wouldn   t be the last time he was locked in a room because of some kind of disruption  and once she got wind of it  she immediately put a stop to it because of the genuine kindness and improvisation of many teachers and ed techs  caleb continued to move through school with only minor snafus  the one thing that presented an ultimate source of anxiety was fire drills  unexpected  loud and chaotic  it was his worst nightmare  it finally got to the point where they would tell his classroom teacher ahead of time and he could be escorted outside before it ever happened  but in the case of a prank yank on the ol    fire alarm  or burnt toast in the teacher   s lounge  he was thrown into a fit of anxiety that would keep him out of school several days to a week  that degree of overstimulation was  for him  almost septic at home  his day to day life was more or less consistent  while my experience growing up with a mum with an eating disorder was difficult  for caleb  the obsessive compulsive nature of her lifestyle was exactly what he required to stay calm and safe  he and my mother had  and to this day still have  a very symbiotic relationship recognizing this  when i became emancipated from my parents at age sixteen after several years of tumult  it was largely because i knew that if anyone    got involved     i e  social services  then caleb and i both would end up in foster care  the reality was  caleb would never have survived that  although the situation at home was detrimental to my well being  it worked for him  this isn   t an uncommon phenomenon  two kids growing up in the same house can  and do  have vastly different experiences  wise enough to realize this  i decided that the only solution was to make sure no one touched him  that his life was uninterrupted it worked out fine for him  although my mother   s health went through periods of such severe downturn that she could not care for him  she had done well by him to teach him independence to some degree  although he couldn   t do many things by himself  for example  if he wasn   t reminded to eat  he likely would not remember to  he did understand how to follow directions  so  even when my mother was in and out of the hospital  as long as caleb understood what tasks he needed to fill his day with  he could  my father  being relatively stoic in his approach to having a chronically ill wife  an autistic son and a divorced from the family daughter  kept him on an even keel until my mother returned home during those years  i wasn   t present in caleb   s life  this was intentional  for him to flourish  he needed to be kept out of the things that were troubling me  he didn   t need the emotional impact  one misunderstood element of autism is empathy  caleb doesn   t empathize not in the sense that he has no empathy  this is a common misconception  autistic kids are not sociopaths  quite the opposite  caleb is  in fact  so mowed over by the emotions of life and those around him that he can   t process it  so  he doesn   t  he doesn   t have a mean bone in his body and never acts with malicious intent  this creates problems for him  though  if he were ever in a situation where he should mistrust someone who is trying to hurt him  he would not defend himself  for a kid who grew up kicking everyone out of frustration  he would never punch someone in self defense by the time he reached high school  my brother had earned himself a pathfinding reputation  he was the first child with an autism diagnosis in the school district to be fully integrated into a regular classroom setting  the barrage of kids who would come in the next few years were well taken care of because my brother had taught the teachers   and administration   about what it really meant to live as someone with autism  with the help of some truly devoted and wonderful educators  in particular his one on one aid  nancy  he succeeded  he graduated with honors  and spoke at his graduation  for me  sitting in the audience  it was a miraculous moment  i felt so at peace  finally  with the decisions i had made along the way  more importantly  confirmed what i had suspected all along  caleb was a special kid with a big heart  and i was the proudest big sister in the world after his graduation  my father  a man of few words  shared his own emotions about watching my brother graduate  although i might be considered the    writer    in the family  his words touched me deeply and i think he puts it better than i ever could    in the mid nineties autism wasn   t as well known as it is today  dan marino and jenny mccarthy hadn   t started to get the word out about their kids  though doug flutie was doing his best  we knew something was going on  but no one could put a name on it  the word    autism    was put out there  but back then they could not do diagnostic testing until the kids were around seven years old  we were told caleb might talk  or he might not  don   t expect hugs  eye contact and by all means don   t touch  don   t expect much affection  or even recognition sometimes there were tantrums  aversion to noise and crowds  and comfort with being alone  we used the programs available and had the help of a few dedicated people  it took a few years and some patience  but the result was worth every second when caleb read a poem at his middle school graduation  standing in front of over one hundred people  i cried like a baby  seeing him take to the stage twice today  i did it again today  my brother is twenty years old  he still lives at home with both my parents  he is smart  funny and loves to volunteer at the school library  we don   t know what the future holds for him  though this past year we went to the probate court to make preparations for the day when i will be his full guardian  i don   t know what caleb will be doing in five  ten or even twenty years from now  but i know that my life will be enriched by helping him to take that journey if you like what you just read  please hit the    recommend    button below so that others might stumble upon
