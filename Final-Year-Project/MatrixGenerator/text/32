if noth els thi year ha been a battlefield of two pair of charact we know so well they re peopl whom we look up to and aspir to be one day we re wow when we see their result befor u yet we can t realli decid on which side we re lean i m not talk about iron man v captain america or batman against superman i m refer to the never end dilemma of mani blogger out there am i just a writer or a content market should you choos can you be both we ll look into everyth in just a second it s a well known fact that a success blog need both a profession writer who will go into all the trendi and evergreen topic wherea someon would have to promot it it get confus at time but don t worri here are the top differ between a content market and a writer for starter we all know what a writer is howev the problem increas when we throw the term content market into the mix it s a job titl that ha been gain in popular in the recent year although it exist a long long time ago accord to sever dictionari a content market can be defin a a person who strateg creat text audio video or imageri with a messag to the custom that s what great content is about while at the same time tri to put a dollar into the pocket both the writer and the content market should write like their target audienc speak know the grammar and spell rule use clear languag and someth along those line the job descript is kind of the same with the one of the writer but not the same that s whi i use kind of one of the distinct differ between the writer and the copi market is the voic with which they write that s the uniqu combin of word usag a well a punctuat and grammar rule with the help of the uniqu writer s voic each writer tell their stori in a one of a kind way and tell someth no one els did the writer is usual the one who tell thing for instanc while describ an object the writer in you want to break down all the featur and fact and in the end put a call to action that way the audienc or the custom are in a way told what to do and are expect to act on that the content market howev doesn t tell but show ye write is import it s the base of the whole process but simpl write doesn t make for an awesom content instead of use that call to action the content market in you can put infograph state all the benefit of the product or just explain whi the audienc and potenti custom need precis that in their life you show and tri to sell it while you re not explicitli tell them to buy it for exampl if you re write a blog post or an articl about dress for the summer you can state in bullet point how to choos the perfect dress base on an occas color length and so on the writer may spread the stori of the product or servic through sever articl but in the end everyth would be aim at buy it the emphasi on the product and the call to action suggest that the writer want a one time transact wherea the content market would think ahead to illustr you can launch a seri of articl where the first one wouldn t even speak of the product itself instead they will be focus on the need for it on the market and whi peopl would want it then after the crowd are engag and eager to find out what it s about you will mention the product thi strategi will lead to an increas number of peopl be interest in your brand thu build a relationship that will last for a long time in order for the writer to be effect one mustn t put word in their throat when they re care connect word it s best to leav them alon the sentenc you would write can be move and touch but a a content market you should go back to them and make them poignant with the right imag the right focu on sever part that stand out take a look at thi exampl what do you think which one would sell more woman s shoe yeah the second one definit to write like that you may take inspir from fiction poetri and all kind of non academ book the success blogger should have two alter ego the writer and the content market the first one would come up with the raw materi of the post but we all know that there s so much more to a great blog post here s one well known structur the content market take care of an attract grip headlin awesom sentenc in the intro

stay with them after they close the page a purpos just like in everi child stori the moral and the lesson of the stori should be reveal in the end suggest of what to do next we went on and on about
