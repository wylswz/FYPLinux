the last month has been a rollercoaster of emotions  the despair of the referendum result  the anger more people are being attacked for who they are or the colour of their skin  the hope of talking with people from all parties and none about movement building  the exhilaration of walking out front with our leader shouting for europe through the centre of london with loads of newcomers joining in young people who were new to party politics telling me after one of the pro eu rallies how they were now inspired to get more involved  this was  then  sadly followed by a crushing feeling  the sinking feeling when some of those self same political newbies said they could not understand what was happening with our party  they could not understand why i was not allowed to tell local members why i want to represent them in any seat the lib dems will try to win i   ve been asked several times the past week to explain why i was not shortlisted for richmond park and why they should be concerned about it  others have told me to shut up and move on  or warned me that by speaking out i   ve ruined my chances forever i should say from the start that i do not know sarah olney  who won the selection  and who i have congratulated but do not know  a party that can let a relatively new member of    months represent them in a key seat is exactly the sort of party i want to exist  a party in which shortly after joining you can perform well at giving a speech and answering questions from members and stand a chance of becoming their mp  i would have liked to have had the same opportunity  and that is where the party has let me  and all of us down the rules meant that there was no interview process  no appeals  and no publication of how we were to be judged  and with all deadlines for all the seats on the same day  applying for one was essentially a roll of the lucky dice  this led to me being refused from even being shortlisted to represent the party i   ve poured heart and soul into  since then  i   ve tried to find out why  i   ve been told by senior figures that for reasons of efficiency applicants have to be whittled down to a manageable number  i   ve been told that being a local candidate is the trump card for many parties that seek a reputation as local champions  standing up for local people then i found out that in another south london seat eight people were shortlisted    six of which didn   t have an obvious connection to the local area  i   ve been told that nick clegg did not live in the seat when he was shortlisted  inconsistent  yes  but also flawed  people my age in london are not primarily concerned with their locality when they vote  they are having to move around every year or two and cannot put down roots  they cannot suddenly move  as it   s been suggested i should have done  before being selected for a job  like many my age  i work in the gig economy  and cannot leave a place that is a relatively cheap just on a chance something might come up  especially if all our target seats are in more affluent areas so the party i love is closing the door on me and people like me  it also wants to shut out the huge swathes of the population round my age who we need to inspire and involve  who think politics is nothing but bad  as their future grows ever darker and opportunities are snatched away  we have a rising tide of nationalism and an opposition with all factions now talking about how we can reduce immigration  a politics that talks more about dividing us than uniting us  that talks little about expanding the opportunities for younger people  i believe i can connect with these anxious  angry voters but a local party in deciding i was not a    credible candidate    for their area simply because i do not live there implies conversations with the voters should be about local amenity issues  and says where you live is more important than what you   ve done  a local party that was not interested in the diversity and experience i would bring as a gay jewish renter while seeking to represent area that is less and less christian  less white  and indeed increasingly private renting i would have been willing to move to the area in the event of an election  i would have liked to prove myself but was not given a chance  we need sensible reforms so we are not killing new talent  new ideas or restricting diversity  if you even think there   s something of a point in any of this  then it can only benefit the party to have a full independent investigation  given threatening private tweets from senior members of the party to donors phoning saying    he   s just not the right calibre of candidate     the party should get to the bottom of what went on i   ve had a lot of support the last few weeks from people who understand my frustration  i   ve also had criticism though for speaking out about this  that is why there should be an appeals process  to avoid public discussion and manage a situation so that everyone feels heard  but for an organisation with the words liberal and democrat in to allow a few people to restrict candidates without being held accountable is wholly unacceptable  i would have been happy to lose after a fair  open and democratic debate on the relative merits of being local and having campaign experience  or whatever i   ve been told that although it   s clearly unfair  it somehow doesn   t matter  there   s not likely to be an election anyway and by next year there will be full selections  but as well as handing incumbents a now unfair advantage virtually impossible to overcome  and a sense that a small number of people  however temporarily  can control a very important privilege  and that sets a totally unacceptable precedent and richmond park aside  how can we possibly champion electoral reform and fairer votes if we don   t practice strong internal democracy  when we go out and stand on external stages and talk about fairer voting systems         we need to be able to point to our own undeniably fair voting  and every new member should know that should they want to run in the future  they will all be given a fair opportunity  if you agree  i   d encourage you to email  email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script
