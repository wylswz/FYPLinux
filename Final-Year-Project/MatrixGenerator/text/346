i moved to nebraska from the east coast over the summer  i expected to lose myself in the prairies and between the cornstalks in america   s heartland  however  when i road tripped to my new home  i started to see anti abortion billboards on the highway  they increased as i approached less populated areas  too  i didn   t expect to greeted by bigotry in the name of the pro life movement months ago  i met a young woman named mary  with a relatable story  originally from the bay area  she has lived in omaha for the past ten years  at    years old  she pursued an abortion after breaking ties with an abusive partner  her last interaction with involved a police escort to his house to retrieve the last of her belongings  while she identifies as catholic  religious opposition within the local pro life community made her procedure even more difficult to endure i chose to share this interview with ask me about my uterus because its compassionate  praised community  not every publication can offer that support  and i was extremely conscious as i pitched different ones this is her story i am    years old and female  i am a young professional in a stem field  specializing in data and analytics  an industry where women aren   t necessarily seen in right now  you can imagine the position i   m in  some of my peers are already married and having kids  it   s difficult for me  especially for someone that wants to advance their career  i graduated from a reputable four year university i met someone interested in me  and we went on a couple of dates  they decided we should get more serious  i don   t know  in retrospect  it wasn   t necessarily a healthy speed  but with this particular person  every circumstance is different  he started inviting me over more  and he lives in bellevue  which is a half hour away from where i live  i pay a lot for this place with the garage  so i got more irritated towards the end he was in the military and    years old  he told me he previously dated someone    years old when he was     that age gap  to me  was concerning  but again  people can do whatever they want  there   s no set in stone age when people should date  but the way he described her personality  it sounded a lot like me when i was     i was still trying to figure out who i was a few things started to irritate me as we dated  i like to cook and do    female    things whatever that means  i love food  and to me  if you want to have good food in your love  you need to learn to cook  i don   t care what gender you are  i   d say these things and he   d turn it into commentary  for instance  there   s a song called    hard out here    by lily allen  it had a lot of criticisms granted for other reasons  but he pronounced it a    feminist anthem     he   d also say things like     when you get older  you   re going to move to the suburbs  you won   t like living urban    one night  i decided to end it  it didn   t feel right anymore  i didn   t want anything to do with him  at that point  i had two sheriffs escort me to his house  because he had a gun in the bedroom  whenever i told him i wanted my stuff back  he never responded  this was the scariest thing i   ve ever done  he texted me after i left     no wonder why your boyfriends left     commenting on my previous poor relationship there are definitely more pieces  but that   s the gist  when he started making comments about my family  like telling my sister she needed to watch her weight  that was disgusting it was financial reasons  it   s more expensive to get it done at planned parenthood and there  are limited  payment plans  they were able to work with me and give me a price i could afford  i  of course  had to take out several loans for this  procedure   at the time  i was distraught i did  in the state of nebraska         this is the part that gets me  i think because my company is family oriented  depending on your company especially in more conservative states  there are restrictions states can place on carriers  i had to pay out of pocket  otherwise  my company   s chosen insurance is comprehensive also  the bellevue clinic doesn   t put you under  with amnesia  whereas planned parenthood does  in that case  you   d need someone to escort you back and i didn   t have anybody  that made it even more difficult i spoke to an employee  in the medical coding department  about situations the clinic encounters with incest victims  employer   s insurance still can   t cover that  because nebraska has restrictions on elective abortions  even in my case   with an abusive partner   the circumstances don   t matter  you don   t have a choice feminism is definitely discouraged  although educating young women is valued  it doesn   t include making your own choices and exploring what is best for you  there   s a huge discussion about comprehensive sex education and that   s something people are afraid to talk about it  sex is taboo outside of marriage  but it extends beyond intercourse  it includes relationship dynamics  such as what a marriage should be in high school  they didn   t talk about birth control and condoms  they warned about stds and avoiding them altogether when people catch it  i think it   s not something to be ashamed of  when the discussion isn   t inclusive  people  with chlamydia  feel ashamed  people make a joke out of it  but i think that   s disgusting it   s like  you   re going to tell me to stay with an abusive partner and kept that child  i wouldn   t have loved that child and not wanted it to be apart of my existence  do you want me to keep something that   s part of me biologically  because of your beliefs  not provide me with support or counseling or anything at all  you expect me to be a loving mother  no  i didn   t want ot share anything with  my past partner  it infuriates me  you   re telling an incest victim they must keep that child  you   re telling a rape victim they must keep that child  of course  everyone has their own situations  but that   s what pro choice is about  you can make the choice to say no to a procedure  you can also say yes  i think people are afraid to say  yes   because it sounds heartless  but i   m going to say it my mom is not from this country  and she is a naturalized citizen  my dad isn   t from  omaha   either  he liked the area when he was stationed with the military  and we have great school districts no one in my family knows  for instance  i   m sure my cousin in washington would be fine  telling their families about an abortion   since she is so progressive  it   s also one of those things where people might say they   re for it  but when someone close to them experiences it  they think of you differently coming up to the clinic itself  i saw one person holding the virgin mary and a cross  i didn   t engage with them  but i felt unsafe because those people are ruthless  they think saving an  unborn  life is more important than the actual person  which is paradoxical inside  i felt safe  it   s enclosed and ways of containing  making it more comfortable  it   s welcoming inside  they had a metal detector and you need a photo id to enter  they ask you to be on time and those things are strict walking out  i helped another person get inside  i think everyone  that made the choice to come here  should be helped  then i heard  a protestor  wailing on about    my child lives     it irritates me afterwards  i did the normal thing  i actually wasn   t in much pain  i ate some good food  went home  and slept  it sounds so casual  but that   s how it was no  i did tell my boss at work  as progressive and radical as i was  i burst into tears  i wasn   t sure if i was pregnant or not  i told her what i was going to  i wasn   t afraid of what i had to go through  but instead  the people  like i said  they   re ruthless  that   s the only time i   ve been vocal about that because unfortunately  it   s about my safety  it shouldn   t be that way  either honestly  i see this in the community i   m apart of  the debate community  it   s not only about their social experiences  but their academic ones  they   re vocal about women   s issues and  have the opportunity to  speak about their decisions in an eloquent manner  it   s always been our community to discuss these things  as an academic group  we ask ourselves why these things are the way they are  that   s one of those most apparent times when other women i know have been questioned about the choices they make  whether it   s sexuality  academics  or anything else i went through something more than medical  but also surgical  it   s very scary  there are certain parts of the procedure required by the state of nebraska  such as how to take care of yourself and what to expect  granted  after a medical procedure  they can send you home right away  from my experience  i remember the people there were so welcoming if you have to go alone  remember you   re not alone  it frustrates me i can   t say this as who i am  but it   s a more common experience  sadly  we are not always able to say who were are  help  and comfort you  the people in that waiting room  there were couples  there was a mom and a daugher  don   t let other people   s    idea of who is in that waiting room close your mind  people from all walks of life of there  walk in with your head held high if this is the right decision for you  and yes  they will ask you multiple times  do know it isn   t always the final decision  they work with you as much as possible  no one is judging you  they are making sure you   re safe  although the state doesn   t force you to look at the ultrasound  they will take it  other parts may be required as well  but some are designed as scare tactics  many women experience this as well the afterbirth procedure isn   t as painful  either  people conducting  this procedure  are professionals  everyone   s body will react different  know especially these people are here to take care of you  you   re never in the position when you   re unsafe  depending on your procedure or the medical instructions  you might be able to get a ride back  i personally drove back and took the medications as instructed  i was fine at the end of the day  don   t be afraid to reach out  you are not a disgusting person  you made a choice  don   t let anyone tell you anything less for doing that  you exercised your rights and you are in a better place my main message is that you   re not alone  if i could hug and embrace all of you  i would  because you are wonderful  great people that exercise their right for a good fight there are public forums  reddit is my favorite  i   ve shared my story with a few people  especially when they post questions  you can also just lurk among other user   s responses  people are always welcoming about talking about my experience  i remember someone reminding me that it   s all circumstantial  circumstances will never match  there are several communities out there  but unfortunately  not many people know about them because of the current  political  climate  i can understand
