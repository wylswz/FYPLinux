a century of life had sparked a great struggle in her mind doubting the belief she had cherished her entire life that one day she could walk the earth  the mountains could never walk  the rocks too were legless  and so was she a young stag scraping the sand for green mussels found her stranded on the beach  the waves had washed her ashore  he carried her to the water where the current pulled her back to the deep they met again on a half moon night when the tide ebbed  she held her hand up as the young stag ran to her    don   t     she said     i don   t want to go back    a mountain of salt in her hand she presented to him  salt was all she had treasured  bits of home she had to bring with her to keep the waves away  a vow she made to unchain her from the sea the young stag sampled the salt  the sharp taste of seawater tickled his tongue  salt was the flavour he did not know he had desired all this while  he had developed a taste for meat at the time of the great drought many years before  he had nothing to eat but shellfish by the beach    i can give you more if you take me with you     she said he nodded  he carried her to his cabin atop a gentle slope that overlooked the south china sea  they learned to love  live together  until the day the sea came looking for her each day that she salted his meal  that very day she would shed a piece of her scale  every day  piece by piece  to reveal a pair of legs taking shape underneath  her bronze skin that ended at her waist had now spread to her nascent feet a year had passed  she plucked the last piece of scale from her ankle and kept it in a wooden box the stag had crafted for her  a mountain of them  a piece of scale for each day  scales once shimmered in amber now grey and brittle  next to it stood an identical wooden box  it was empty  they had consumed all of the salt    get me more  i need it     the young stag said she shook her head     we   ll find other salt  earth salt    it was a dim morning with a faint rainbow arching beyond the clouds when a great tremor shook the earth  the hut collapsed  they escaped to a clearing and saw the sea receding  a force was pulling the waves away from the shore  it was time to run they knew they were being chased  they ran uphill deeper into the rainforest  a loud roar was trailing them  she lifted her nose in the air  it was the sea  that sweet whiff of salt drawing closer she tugged at his hand to stop running  she looked him in the eye  he knew what it meant  no escape  no regrets  they turned back and watched as the sea that was coming for them tore the forest apart  in the moist  heavy air  the forest ground was upturned where trees were falling to the rustling sound of twigs and leaves that rained over them  the waves were coming  her home came calling photos by oscar keys author of short stories at work on his first novel about the parallel destructive behaviour between man and nature
