by jay acunzo founder host of unthink just say content bring to mind a hollow shell a contain and so u market plod along obsess over exactli that we talk about piec and deliver or even name the thing post ebook tweet video rather than agon over the stuff insid i e the stuff the audienc is realli after content it s a grow mess of contain that hold on didn t we start with a neatli organ system whi do i see noth but chao and wait whi do we have so mani of these thing do we actual use them all and c mon how are these still dirti i thought we clean off all the greasi and smell from the old stuff the interrupt advertis the intern corp speak the chicken tikka masala ye content is the tupperwar drawer of thi here internet kitchen and dammit we can do better than these empti contain ask yourself what if we use a word that referenc the stuff insid instead thi idea come from bryan rhoad formerli of intel while at the compani bryan and colleagu luke kintigh launch intel s tech and lifestyl magazin iq bryan wa also one of the mastermind behind the compani s geniu collabor with vice out of the partnership sprang the great creator project i m told that a regim chang at intel caus the compani to pull their involv in the project to instead focu on content sit closer to product sale i ll just leav thi here let s move on in a recent convers i told bryan about my desir to creat more elev more impact content no more make yet anoth and a lot more make the onli it wa then that he reveal what i ve alway known the veri word content might be the singl biggest barrier to do truli great work the daili show of tech or the thi american life of market just seem so far from what most peopl think of when they hear content we should talk about it like program he said if you realli think about it program make a world of sens just a content make you think of someth bland forgett and empti program bring to mind someth much more power there s intent behind the creation of program it s the stuff that fill the channel or contain and the individu instal all fit togeth to take peopl on one coher journey toward a conclus a realiz a resolut hell even a product brand are inde like a sort of hollywood studio back and creat educ or entertain medium and our market channel are like tv network we say channel after all it s how our audienc tune into our work and content market and creator both intern and extern to our compani are the product team and the talent as content market we re in the busi of creat thing that can be distribut over ani number of network what do we call the stuff we distribut content is a jumbl mess of individu piec shot haphazardli through a given channel program on the other hand impli intent purpos and a commit over time to an audienc like the univers studio of your nich you approv and fund variou program distinct coher idea convey by the creativ that stuff insid like the nbc of your nich you offer channel for the distribut of your program that could be your own channel websit newslett event etc or channel where you ve either paid for airtim or find it for free organ and paid social search co market etc for instanc like the spielberg beyonc ira glass jennif lawrenc and ye even like the zach braff of your nich you are the product power and the talent you make the program actual happen you know how to produc a stori how to see the world like the audienc doe and how to execut the creativ process you are the nerdi but lovabl talent say program is similar to say content brand it s a standalon often overtli name project or seri you build it by treat it like a product not a campaign or glorifi substitut for an ad so sure you ll need to use all those tupperwar contain but you connect them in a smart way base on what s insid you cook up that delici chicken parm with spaghetti the big idea the approv concept then dish it out into all those contain bryan rhoad exampl were intel iq and the creator project the list go on though ebay s open for busi or amex s open forum or moz s whiteboard friday or invis s design disruptor video great content brand or content s ask a content guy or nextview s tech trend shootaround unlik that messi drawer of still greasi contain program elev our eye in our creativ kitchen here s a look at the specif of program without it no amount of transact market matter unless you get peopl to stop swirl around their million of option across sever screen to focu on you just for a moment you don t exist more content contain just add to that alreadi messi drawer how can you stand out from all that crap don t add more contain make someth differ focu more on the insid although i d love to defend my belov storytel from a human element emot scienc of the speci etc let s appeal to the inner quarterli busi review in all of u it s far easier to convert someon who ha been prime by a stori they agre with than to tri and interrupt someon elsewher and sell them cold everi stori ha three part which when complet lead to the upsel moment those part are a statu quo your audienc face the conflict they encount and the resolut for instanc with my show idea the magic from abov it might be thi good sale and market happen in the natur movement of the consum stori are the roadmap lead you and your audienc along the same path you re compet against everyon across ton of channel and screen and medium and shoot bourbon ugh you get it among your competitor today are your audienc s friend and famili plu their favorit medium outlet and individu influenc and person you have to be just a good or better than those group to gain attent the onli time you re realli compet with competitor directli is immedi befor a transact which we all know by now is just one veri small part of the buyer s journey otherwis you re up against your custom s favorit thing in the world and nobodi ever miss the big game turn off game of throne close their friend s instagram feed dvred the latest sitcom stop listen to thi american life and pocket their favorit column for later becaus they couldn t wait to consum your content market what if we could make someth so good your audienc would say whoa they made a sportscent for my industri they launch thi american life for my world they film a late night show just for me as content market we are the studio the network the product power and the talent and unlik mani organ we associ with power program our busi model are thrive what if we embrac a bigger vision than demand gen or convers and in turn we could gener more of each what if we earn our audienc s attent over time not trick our way into a few second in one moment in time what if we becam the thing they couldn t wait to choos what if we made program not content thi might not be our holi grail but it s damn
