i think it   s pretty natural to be scared of showing yourself  that   s something we are all prone to  we talk about letting our hair down  showing the real us  removing the veils and the mysteries and the hidden parts that we keep locked away i   m like that  too  or at least i used to be  i can remember when i got my first ever full time job  trying to store away my misfits t shirts and pretend that i wasn   t a weirdo little punk kid  i was a quote unquote businessman that was pretty pointless  i was trying to deny who i was because i didn   t think it worked with the new me that i wanted to project  i didn   t think people would respect me for being a little out there  for being a little odd i   d never do that anymore  over the last    years  i   ve come to understand that it   s okay to be a fucking weirdo  it   s okay to be stranger than your average  and it   s okay to let that freak flag fly i   ve learned it  because it   s my biggest point of difference  it   s what sets me apart people aren   t easy to categorise  if you get through the surrounding  protecting layers and start to explore their core  when you get deeper than the suit and tie  deeper than the job  deeper than the tv shows they like to watch on the weekend  you can find that there   s something crazy about almost anyone we   re all very much unique products of our own individual backgrounds  that   s undeniable  we   ve all been through stuff that has transformed and shaped us  whether it was hard times or punk rock music our histories  our pasts  the things we love  the things that stop us from fitting in perfectly  should never be ignored if you try to beat them down  if you try to squeeze and pressure them out of yourself  it   s never healthy  it   s downright emotionally deadly  in fact you   re denying something that is intrinsically related to your entire personality something that has given you the baseline that the rest of your life is built on how do you think your carefully built walls are going to crumble  when you remove their foundations how do you think you can ever remain stable  if you   ve got nothing stable to stand on for entrepreneurs  for creatives  even for accountants  it   s the same story  trying to make yourself fit in  is just not healthy  trying to ignore the fact that you   re a total fucking weirdo is only going to make you angry  frustrated  depressed and isolated so what do you have to do  turn up to work in a hoodie and cannibal corpse shirt  no  not necessarily  although  i tend to what you have to do is accept yourself for who you really are  and accept that pushing and pulling yourself into a caricature of what you think someone in your life or job should look like  isn   t going to make you successful acceptance is the hardest part of living  that   s the truth  but if you can manage it  you might just find a little happiness at the end of the line i   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
