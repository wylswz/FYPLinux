let   s start off with full disclosure         i   ve invested in what m   is doing in more ways than one  and inevitably have some inherent biases  i   m wearing multiple hats as author of this blog  i   m on the board of m    i   m an investor in both funds m   has launched  and i   m the father of the managing director of m    that being said  i   m prepared to tell you by the end of this writing why i believe m   is the    best thing since sliced bread    malcolm gladwell said you need        hours of practice to master anything  i know for myself at least  i didn   t practice that many hours on the piano when i was a teenager and forced to take lessons  hence i was far from being a master  now in reality  if you are in    business mode       hours a week  can you be a master at your craft in a mere   years  i believe that simply putting in        hours isn   t going to open the door of mastery         the key is putting in the hours correctly we  meaning anybody who has invested in the vc world  all fantasize about the one unicorn we will be a part of  oh the bliss of telling your friend while you are grabbing overpriced cold brew coffee that the article on the front page of the wsj  detailing the rise and impending ipo of  unicornx   was in your portfolio in their series a round  sure  it might happen  but don   t count on it  as the fantasy is likely much more enjoyable than the ultimate reality for many vcs will be  when sitting in on a bevy of six minute pitches recently  which were really good by the way  i was already seeing visions of unicorns so  what is that secret formula to success in the vc world  what is the so called x factor  let me rephrase that question         what is the true differentiator between responsible  successful venture capitalists and the rest of the pack  or is it just dumb luck  can this endeavor simply be quantified and basically all subjectivity removed  or must possessing the ability to predict and objective subjectivity prevail  all good questions         i   m glad you asked as a board member of m    i am just close enough to the action to be able to rationally compare m   to the rest of the firms in the vc world  by reading the weekly update reports  studying and voting on portcos  and attending industry events  i get enough empirical and anecdotal information to ascertain how m   is performing         specifically the quality and consistency by which they are executing  speaking of measuring performance         looking to m     s fund results to gauge performance is not feasible         it will be   years  more or less  and by that time potential investors in m   will have committed or passed at least two fund participation opportunities  yes  choosing a vc fund is not something that involves a nice neat equation  choosing is hard  however i think m   makes the decision much easier  here   s how   let   s end with full disclosure  i   m wearing multiple hats  i   m biased  i   m also fully convinced that m   is going to knock it out of the park  m   is based in chicago and it looks like the chicago cubs are set to conclude a historical year by winning the world series         hence a baseball analogy is fitting  about the authorbrent gutwein currently lives in west lafayette  indiana and his day job is acting as the managing partner of real estate management company granite student living  prior to founding granite  brent owned aag venture  llc  a row crop farming operation and grain elevator that sourced and serviced the commodity needs of morning song wild bird food  in addition  he was the ceo of fred gutwein family citrus  llc  a florida based family citrus operation for    years  brent managed the production and finances of the citrus operation for fred gutwein family citrus  llc as well as the strategic liquidation of the underlying real estate  brent is also co founder and president of boulder group         a real estate capital management firm providing individuals and institutions with professional  dedicated and focused attention to real estate deals  brent received his bachelor of science and masters in business administration from the krannert school of management of purdue university  he holds an indiana real estate broker   s license  brent is married with three children  he is an avid runner and recently achieved his goal of running the equivalent number of miles as jaunting around the equator  hence he has decided to turn around and head back home   vc focused on midwest early stage  startups  objective and analytical investment process combined with a risk mitigating portfolio theory
