first of all  thanks for bringing your perspective to this conversation i respectfully disagree  src medium the progressive movement is about finding compassion  empathy  and room for the voiceless in our society ever since the founding of the united states  we   ve been having a conversation about the direction of our country  for over two centuries  the dominant voices in that conversation have been those of white  straight  christian  wealthy males the only way to address the problems facing our society is for white  straight  christian  wealthy males to listen to other voices and to learn from their perspective so we can all move forward if you are within one of those categories  white  christian  wealthy  or male  to shout down  dismiss or pigeonhole is to cover your ears and demonstrate your disrespect for the entire american conversation the point of the progressive movement is to our culture forward so that all members have a place  not just the ones at the top and the ones with a historical advantage so yes  to defy that forward movement by insisting on hanging on to obsolete ideology that rejects tolerance  diversity  and respect  so called    political correctness      is to be labeled as someone who seeks to keep our culture stagnated as someone who only wants to hear themselves talk  and that only people like themselves have the right to a voice in the conversation about our country   s direction freedom of speech isn   t about everyone talking at once  it   s sometimes about shutting up and listening so everyone has a voice freelance copywriter  word geek  story nerd  proud sjw  fluent in human  badassmotherblogger  www wordweaverfreelance com
