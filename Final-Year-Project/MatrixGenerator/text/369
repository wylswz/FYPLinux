my trip started off with a silly mistake  i realised the night before flying out that i had soaked my passport in the wash the week before         i had just flown back from spending a month in nyc helping to set up our us operations  luckily  after a night of stress and madness         the customs officers and passport scanning machines accepted my passport  crisis averted i was on my way to the us again but this time to seattle for mozcon  one of my favourite marketing conferences  and this year we managed to bring over    team members along from our sydney office after settling in to the beautiful city of seattle  i was on the way back from the watching my first game of nfl and i found out some incredibly sad news  my grandmother back home in australia had passed away knowing i was on a work trip and that i was probably very busy  like always  and being quite far away  my mum immediately followed up by saying she totally understood that she didn   t expect for me to fly back reflecting on the situation  my immediate thought was    i can   t fly back  i am under a lot of pressure here in the us at the moment  i   m just too busy and it   s so far     i came up with all the justifications i could think of as to why it made sense for me not to fly back so i carried on  and decided i wasn   t flying back to australia to be there for the funeral  my family were supportive of my decision  yet  i didn   t feel completely comfortable with it day two of mozcon wrapped up and that evening there was an event planned called moz ignite  for those not familiar with ignite talks  it   s an event where speakers are given   minutes to talk on a topic and the slides auto progress every    seconds  the one rule with moz ignite was that the topics could not be marketing related i learned about hyperhidrosis  a condition where you sweat excessively  and how someone cooked meals for strangers into their home each night in exchange for a bottle of wine  but it was the talk by michael cottam on the topic    is your family time for sale     that impacted changed me forever michael spoke about being a workaholic and from that moment i could immediately relate  he was building a business called thebigday com and spent long days and hours where he wasn   t able to spend time with his wife and son then everything hit at once  he found someone to buy the company that he had built up over   years  this was great news for him  but in contrast he had also found out the terrible news that his wife had been diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer         she passed away two months later michael talked about how this impacted him  how he wished he had spent more time with her and less time working on his business another tragic thing happened  the company he sold his business too went bankrupt and never paid him a dime  he was left with nothing in return for the business that had taken up so much of his time over the last   years and had to start again so you   re thinking how could things get any worse  well  they did  his loving parents had stepped in to help him and his son get back on their two feet  then the final tragedy happened     years after his wife had passed  both of michael   s parents both got shot and killed by a crazy neighbor and their home was burned down michael was left alone         now just him and his son michael was so incredibly brave telling this story and also the overarching message  cherish the time you have with your family and loved ones  your family   s time is not for sale  you could lose them any moment and live in regret that you didn   t appreciate the time you had with them i was in complete shock  and so was the entire audience  many of us were in tears  when michael finished  everyone stood up from their chairs and gave a standing ovation i spoke with the person who was next to me and told her how rocked i was by the presentation  i spoke to her about my grandmother passing away and the fact that i had made the decision to stay in seattle but i wanted to change that she said the best piece of advice she was ever given was that people only remember who didn   t go to the funeral  not who went from this moment  everything changed for me i went home and rang my fianc           within moments i was distraught and crying endlessly  i told her how i wanted to go home  i talked about michael   s talk and how much it impacted me  i immediately booked the tickets to fly back on the next plane the following day  it was literally the last moment possible  and assuming all my connecting flights were on time  sea    lax    syd    per  i would make it to the funeral   hours before i felt like i had ejected from everything in my life to just commit to the thing that i realised mattered most to me         being there for my family i thought now that i had made the decision  it would be easy  but it wasn   t  i got to the airport in seattle and they couldn   t print my flight ticket  my credit card transaction was blocked by my bank because i hadn   t notified them i was overseas  i got on the call to them for    mins trying to sort it  but was stuck on hold  i had to get off the call  go through security and start the call again  i swiftly booked another ticket from sea to lax because i didn   t want to waste any time after    mins on hold and another    mins sorting my ticketing issue and literally when they notified passengers it was the last board i was ticketed for all my flights from lax through to perth  what a relief i made it to lax  my flight to sydney was delayed by    mins  on came the butterfly effect when i finally arrived in sydney  after going through customs it was taking too long for my baggage to arrive to the baggage claim  i had    mins to make it to the domestic terminal to get my connecting flight to perth i had to make the decision to abandon my bags  i spoke to two staff who said i couldn   t do it  but i refused to listen  i spoke to a qantas airline staff member  told them of my situation and what i needed them to help me with  she organised a level   security clearance so i could leave customs and took me through all the security check ins  after a stressful bus ride i made it with   minutes to spare  i can   t explain the relief in that moment most importantly  i made it to my grandmother   s funeral  i was one of the pallbearers  i felt so honoured  i felt so lucky to be there to hear my dad   s words about his mum  my grandmother  she had incredible willpower and he reminded me and all of us that it   s something that he hopes we realise we have inside us all too  this passing message was so important to me and i will forever be changed having heard it after the weekend  i got back to my office  i had some changes i wanted to make to invest more in self care and prioritise time with friends  family and my wife to be   one of the advantages of flying almost    hours within   days is that you get a lot of time to be able to read  i read   books on matrix organisations and wanted to improve the way we operated our business globally i set in place some new boundaries for myself and also some clear things i wanted it was the first time i could truly remember where i had made decisions to put my health and wellbeing first ahead of the business  i felt really proud and empowered by this from here i   the changes have made dramatic improvements to my stress levels and my work has been much more impactful  most importantly  my wife to be has noticed these changes and is noticeably happier seeing that i   m looking after myself more it took a sad life event and a shocking story for me to make these changes  without investing the time in yourself  you won   t be sharing your best self with the people you love  so please  take the time to prioritise the important things in your life founding team at finder com   founder of video summaries website minutely com  when i   m not helping
