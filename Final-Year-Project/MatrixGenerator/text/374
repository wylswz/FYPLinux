how much do you procrastinate  how much time do you waste on crap that doesn   t matter  that you don   t care about  that you don   t even want to be throwing your precious seconds  minutes and hours on i   m guessing a lot  i   m guessing it because you   re probably pretty similar to me  i once used a chrome plugin to block websites that i knew were a time suck  and i found out that i was unconsciously opening up a new tab and going to visit a bunch of crummy  sub par news websites up to    or    times every day time was getting absolutely cast aside with no real conscious care  time was running out  and i knew where the leaks were  but i wasn   t fixing them when people realise that they are not getting shit done  their first thought is that they need to have a fancy new system  hack  app  notebook  list or some other tool  and you know what that leads to yep  another time suck  a time suck that people convince themselves is actually a productive exercise  when in truth it   s just one more attempt at procrastinating  and one more reason to not get shit done that   s because the pursuit of more productivity often misses the point if you   re not getting shit done  there   s actually a pretty simple reason behind it if you   re not getting shit done  it   s because on some level  you don   t want to  you just plain  simple don   t fucking want to for example  if you   re a student and you   re studying for an exam  but your studies keep getting pushed back time and time again  even though you objectively know and understand that you will face dire consequences if you don   t get your crap together         there is still a powerful part of you that doesn   t want to do what must be done it could be because of a completely shallow reason  you want to watch netflix instead  you want to work on your side project  you want to play xbox it could be because you   re working multiple jobs to support your college life  but you don   t even want to be studying the subject you   re trying to exhaust yourself over it could be for something deeper    you   re on a path that you can   t defend even to yourself  you   re full of doubt about the direction your life is following or possibly you   re scared of a future in which you have got shit done  this is particularly common when the task you   re putting off is a deeply personal one  you   re procrastinating about ending an unhealthy relationship with a lover or a friend because you don   t want to deal with the immediate fallout all of those are reasons why you don   t want to get shit done  you   re procrastinating not because you can   t focus  not because it   s impossible to focus  but simply because you don   t want to focus the same is true for entrepreneurs who can   t get their projects done because instead of buckling down and finishing their shit they   re distracted  they   re distracted because on some level they honestly don   t want to finish the same is true for me  when i   m working on building something that i just don   t give shit about  i can   t focus  because i know deep down that i just don   t want to the secret to beating this is looking for the reason  and not just the shallow reason  the real one at the root of your problem  looking for that reason and analyzing it  carefully but ruthlessly because the answer to your productivity failure has very little to do with the pomodoro technique  or a bunch of spreadsheets or using evernote         as much as i love it  all of those things help  all of them are important  but not when the underlying issue has not been solved you won   t get shit done if you unconsciously or subconsciously don   t want to  that   s just a fact if you can examine the choices and the reasoning behind the shit that must be done  and find a way to really appreciate and want them  you can start to solve part of the problem  that requires honesty you   re not going to be able to get by with reasons like    because my parents told me to    or    because i don   t want to let someone down    or even    because it   s the smart thing to do     none of that is good enough  there is no way to make any of those reasons enough  and there   s no way to motivate you to get shit done based on them if you can   t find a reason that makes you want it  you need to find something else to want  that   s going to suck  but it   ll suck more if you constantly fail yourself by failing to solve the reasons behind your productivity breakdown i   m the founder of creatomic i am incredibly excited about changing lives www jonwestenberg comwww creatomic coi   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
