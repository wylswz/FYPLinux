by bobbie johnsonphotographs by richard petrucciroberto chicas doesn   t use uber anymore  actually  he doesn   t do much anymore  not since he met patrick karajah  it was one night in late september  when chicas  a bartender in san francisco  did what many san franciscans do  he summoned uber to get him home  karajah  the on demand driver who answered his request  picked up chicas and his two friends  during the journey  the friends say  everyone got into it about which route to take  eventually  just off i      on a scrubby little patch of land between a housing complex and the freeway  karajah threw them all out of the car  pulled out a hammer and allegedly smashed it  just once  into chicas   s face  karajah then climbed back into his car and drove off  leaving chicas fading in and out of consciousness on the sidewalk with multiple skull fractures  roberto chicas has pretty good reasons to hate uber my first uber wasn   t anything like chicas   s  it was probably a little bit like yours  we were at a friend   s birthday party  and after a few songs  some inadvisable dancing and even more inadvisable shots  my wife and i stumbled out onto the street and into the rain  taxis are a precious enough find in most parts of san francisco  and on damp  foggy evenings they are even more rare  we were stuck and needed to get home and relieve the babysitter  so i grabbed my phone  downloaded the uber app  added my credit card details  ordered a town car  it turned up in just a couple of minutes  and i can tell you now  it was joyous  i   ve waited longer for a sandwich this is exactly what uber is great at  supreme  ludicrous  almost ostentatious convenience  it   s a company built to directly service what seems to be the guiding principle of   st century urban living  there are so many trying to grab a slice of this on demand industry         on demand cleaning  on demand dry cleaning  on demand hair styling  on demand ice cream  on demand marijuana    but let   s face it  anyone who knows anything knows this  uber is the one  it   s more powerful  more convenient  more available  than every other player in the game uber makes everything so easy  and that includes hating it  not the roberto chicas kind of hating it  but something more fluid  more rubbery  harder to pin down the company  valued at     billion and rising  holds a strange position in the technology industry  among a legion of highly detested companies  in a highly detested business  it is the thing people hate the most  and the reactions against it are powerful  instinctive  and often hard to articulate so why  exactly  do we hate uber maybe we hate uber because it has risen astonishingly fast  it started operations just four years ago  and now it   s in     cities across    countries  this summer it raised      billion in funding to grow even bigger  for some  that wealth creates anxiety  for others  it means jealousy  in any case  it means uber has reached the love hate moment faster than most  and in the past few months there have been organized protests against its labor practices and legal status  and suits filed against it for everything from its gratuity charges to wrongful death maybe we hate uber for its ultra competitive  ethics dodging business tactics  uber staff have been caught in a variety of ethically compromising positions  including deliberately calling up drivers from competitors like lyft and then canceling the job at the last minute  or catching the rides and offering rival drivers a pile of cash to switch allegiances right then  right there  it certainly makes them hard to love maybe we hate uber because of surge pricing  for economists and libertarians  it   s the fantasy of a perfect supply and demand pricing system  for riders  it seems like uber constantly demands that you supply it with all your cash  just imagine what it   ll be like over thanksgiving maybe we hate uber because it chews away at our social fabric  taxi drivers and local government  two of the company   s favorite targets  are hardly beloved         but the world uber is creating instead is not exactly a utopia  either  it   s basically advocating for the destruction of thousands of flexible but secure jobs in favor of a far greater stream of mcjobs  where almost anybody can sign up to drive  but those who do are at risk of being fired if their ratings drop anything below almost perfect or maybe we hate uber for its hypocrisy  for a company that rails against the system  uber certainly plays footsie with it a lot  it lobbies as hard as it competes  trying to influence the politics of the cities it wants to colonize  happily building astroturf campaigns and spending that vast pot of cash  need more proof  it hired david plouffe         obama   s david plouffe     as policy chief to try to manage its political strategy all of these things make sense  they   re all solid reasons  but they   re also not unique  walmart  mcdonald   s  bp    the list of companies that struggle with the media  manipulate the rules  and lobby politicians is endless  so the question   s still there  why do we hate uber so much maybe it   s the boss  travis kalanick  who is the face  voice and apparently ever present super ego of uber  is not just a douchebag ceo  he is a caricature of a douchebag ceo  he is brash  unforgiving  constantly yukking it up at the expense of his competitors  his face seems to be eternally contorted into one of those smirks that reminds you of the bad guys in the karate kid  he   s beaten you  you know it  he knows it  but he also wants you to know that you both know it  and get it into your fat head that there   s not a fucking thing you can do about it  unlike most of the moneyed princelings of silicon valley  who struggle         at least a little         with the public perception that they   re wacky technocrats or robber barons  kalanick doesn   t reject a negative perception  he revels in it  or at least he does most of the time he is as aggressive as his business  and he   s certainly not afraid to bully his way to getting what he wants  kalanick calls his rivals out as    evil    at public events  says he   s in a fight with    an asshole called taxi     and stands out front in the company   s announcements and says    that   s hashtag winning     he bros it  and he   s proud this plays well with the media  which is always hungry for anyone willing to play the pantomime villain  and in a tech world where  frankly  most ceos are anonymous repetitions of the same geek kid stereotype  somebody who is so brazen  so dickensian  makes for easy copy but the reporters who enjoy the spectacular tales of uber   s arrogance can also be on the sharp end  uber henchmen regularly take it upon themselves to chide journalists who criticize the company  and sometimes they         and kalanick himself         go much further  last year the ceo attacked a reuters report on a push for new investment as    completely false    and the product of    extremely poor reporting and journalistic ethic      reuters took the story down  but three months later  it emerged that it was really inaccurate only in one sense  it didn   t value the company   s stock high enough   others say kalanick has privately used this episode as an example when threatened with other inconveniently timed stories even though they were also later proven true  then came the latest backlash  which started when a senior executive    joked    to buzzfeed about hiring opposition researchers to expose the personal secrets of a critical reporter  pandodaily   s sarah lacy  in order to stifle criticism  it was dismissed by kalanick as    not representative in any way of the company approach     in fact  it   s entirely typical  buzzfeed has since run documents showing uber was interviewing opposition researchers with an intent to    weaponize facts    against its competitors kalanick   s brand of ruthlessness is not an accident  it   s more a core character trait  he   s been banging around silicon valley since the first boom  a two time almost made it kind of entrepreneur whose desperation to win is tangible  his first start up  a file sharing service    la napster  went bankrupt after it was sued for a quarter of a trillion dollars  his second  which made distributing large files faster  delivered a moderate pile of cash but not very much glory  his desperation to matter seems to be at the center of everything  and maybe we hate uber because it   s built in that image but  then again  the business world is full of wannabes  bros who fist bump every time they screw over some old lady or make some desperate family homeless  they   re the people who buy their way out of billion dollar court cases  the ones who control the vampire squid  even if kalanick is a gigantic asshole  he   s not alone  so the question   s still there  why do we hate uber so much maybe we hate uber because it   s a typical silicon valley startup  it   s not unusual for technology companies to be despised         in fact  it   s much more unusual for them to not tap into vast  unexpected wells of hate as they grow  every big tech company begins life as a scrappy upstart  working out some kink in the system that makes it useful  and then using that as leverage to build itself into a giant  sprawling service         whereupon it becomes both invaluable and infamous  it   s a rite of passage to really fuck things up somewhere along the way  yahoo   s exclamation mark didn   t look so fun the moment it started handing over people   s personal details to the chinese government and getting dissidents thrown in jail  facebook has freaked everybody out multiple times by trying to redefine basic human concepts         friend  like         to match its commercial goals  google set its self up early for this particular kind love hate relationship  thanks to its handy don   t be evil motto  which got harder to live up to as it bought its way into every privacy invading  terrifying future scenario imaginable  from street photography to mobile phones to military robotics to glasses that spy on you  is that where uber   s at  i asked uber to explain why it thinks everybody hates it  but sadly the company didn   t respond to my request for comment but here   s the other thing about nearly every high growth internet start up  they don   t really work    until they work  start ups are an attempt to make us believe in magic  to turn the illusion of success into reality  once something gets big enough         especially if it gets big enough fast enough         it gains its own kind of gravity  at the moment it works  a new market has been made  or an old market has been made obsolete  and that   s when the business effectively gets its license to print money  in the case of a company like google  the difference was being faster and more comprehensive than the competition  it became big enough because there was no better place to navigate your way around the web  which meant there was no better place to advertise  facebook reached the same point by making a photocopy of your social relationships that made it the homepage of choice for hundreds of millions of people  which meant there was no better place to advertise  for a company like uber  which requires vast amounts of on the ground effort to get bigger  that kind of growth is insanely expensive  yes  the software plays a part  but it   s really a people business  that   s why the company has so many competitors  and it   s why it needs to be so aggressive  because even if it is pulling in tens of million of dollars every month  its only real competitive advantage is size  and it only maintains that advantage by pushing outward in every way it can constant expansion is so expensive that it has plenty of people worrying about uber   s long term prospects  remember  it   s currently active in more than     cities  crudely  given that it   s taken      billion in total fund raising  that   s    million per city  it sounds like a lot  and it is  and there is clearly plenty of money coming in from those thousands upon thousands of car rides being taken         documents leaked this week to businessinsider showed that even a year ago  the company was already generating tens of millions every month in revenues  but each city presents a huge set of political and logistical challenges  often with plenty of local peculiarities thrown in for good measure  uber   s success in one place doesn   t necessarily make conquering the next city easier  or cheaper  and because start ups don   t work until they work  the conundrum is always the same  at which point does the amount uber is making outstrip the amount it   s spending  at what point does it really work    uber reminds me a lot of webvan     tweeted benedict evans  a partner at andreessen horowitz  silicon valley   s hottest venture capital firm  which is an investor in lyft     fascinating city by city algebra to make the numbers work  plus massive burn in a play to conquer the world    he   s referring to the online delivery service that  at the height of the dot com boom  promised    minute delivery of groceries to users in cities like chicago  l a   and dallas  as well as across northern and southern california  it raised hundreds of millions in funding to try and achieve hypergrowth  but in the end it just couldn   t make the numbers work  and went bankrupt in july       supporters may scoff at the comparison         c   mon  man  it was years ago  the world   s different now  we   ve all learned our lessons         but there are plenty of similarities that   s because the math of any city by city operation is tough  you spend money to get control of the market in the hope that eventually the numbers come good         but it   s all down to how much cash you have  how much you spend  and how long you wait  uber has plenty of investment  but the scale is gigantic  consider groupon  a shooting star that just a few years ago had the same kind of trajectory  and the same kind of problems  and now is a dot com also ran but even though all of this might be true  it still doesn   t answer the question of why uber is so hated  after all  what do we really care if uber blows up  or collapses in disgrace  the question   s still there if you really want to think about why we hate uber  the best place to start might actually be    years and     miles away  in the suburbs of seattle  that   s where jeff bezos founded amazon  the company that is the best single model for understanding what uber is  and what uber wants to be amazon also started out with a simple  attractive proposition in a single  focused market  it sold books online  suddenly  at least theoretically  the sum of all human knowledge could be delivered to your doorstep with a click  who could argue         i mean really argue         with that  sure  booksellers could feel the pinch  and publishers got collywobbles about the changing relationship between the producer and the distributor  and jeff bezos was a notorious shitbag  who became infamous for upbraiding employees  pushing them to work every waking hour  treating them like dirt  but the reality  it didn   t take long until amazon seemed indispensable  for every human being who was being trounced behind the scenes  there were many more who started using amazon and just couldn   t stop  it made everything so easy  a glance  a click  a package delivered right to your door  the pure convenience was an addiction bezos  in between those spittled attacks on his own staff     are you lazy or just incompetent       masterminded one of the greatest trojan horse campaigns in business history  now  of course  amazon delivers everything  books  toys  video games  kitchen equipment  it delivers media  it makes e readers  it makes tablets  it makes phones  for god   s sake  even if nobody buys them  its web services division builds the infrastructure that helps run many of the sites and services you use every day  including the one you   re reading right now   and you probably never realized all this was happening until it had all happened travis kalanick certainly knows who his heroes are  he rejects the amazon comparison  but he   s made no secret of his admiration for bezos  who was  in fact  an early uber investor   or his envy of amazon   s relentless march from a mere supplier of services to a business that maintains a choke hold on modern life  amazon was  in fact  almost called relentless com      amazon was just books and then some cds  and then they   re like  you know what  let   s do frickin    ladders     kalanick told wired earlier this year     we feel like we   re still realizing what the potential is    we don   t know yet where that stops    amazon         more than any other company  more than google  more than facebook  more than apple         taps into what people desire in a terrifyingly primal way  we want a thing  fast and preferably cheap  not much else matters  we know amazon   s not a nice company  and that the people who work there are treated poorly  we don   t always like it  but there is absolutely  definitively  nothing we will do to stop it  we are happily addicted that same feeling is there with uber  except one thing  we know where amazon has ended up  more or less  but we don   t know where uber   s going to stop  maybe  for uber  it doesn   t stop at all  for kalanick and his team  the means are the end  there is no greater mission  there is only hunger raw  pure  unbridled ambition is an uncomfortable thing to look at  it   s not that it   s ugly  necessarily  it   s just brutally  shockingly honest  uber does not pretend to have a glorious philosophy   it wants to make transport easy  but there is no aspiration as lofty as    organize the world   s information    or    make the world more open and connected     and perhaps that   s the way it should be  after all  would it be more offensive if uber had a mission beyond itself  it certainly feels like less of a betrayal to know that it just wants to be as big  as powerful  as necessary  as it can be that ambition shows  though  perhaps too often  uber likes to think of itself as secretive  but rumors slip constantly out of the mother ship  there was the one about it hiring executives away from google shopping express  in a move that could help it build out its delivery network and damage one of its potential rivals in one fell swoop  confirmed earlier this month   or the one that it   s about to start on demand booze deliveries  it usually denies these rumors  even though depending on where you live  you can already uber courier services  groceries  restaurant meals  when these things turn into publicly available services         on demand weddings  on demand ice cream         they   re often positioned as stunts  but in reality  they   re all trial balloons  tossed out onto the breeze to float upward  as the company   s ambitions stretch toward the sun yes  it   s hubristic  the company   s rise has fuelled plans for a gigantic new office complex in san francisco  with     parking spots included  ironic for a company that says it will eliminate car ownership   and yes  it   s absurd         at least it is if you think that it   s just a fucking taxi app  but all of these pinpricks point toward an endgame that goes way beyond most of the companies we   ve seen before  they point to uber as a central service provider for urban living it doesn   t want to be just an on demand transport company  and it doesn   t even really want to be the amazon of on demand services  the next step in its ascent is to become the uber of everything  and then         eventually  uber wants to be the everything of everything the dick swinging  the gluttony  the not quite lies and the full on bullshit    all of these things  and in particular the spectacular combination of all of these things  are enough to dislike a company  and even to hate it  but it   s incredibly popular  too  because  man  if people vote with their feet         or in this case their fingers         then they keep voting  again and again  for uber and that  in the end  is the real reason so many people hate uber  because whatever we do  we can   t stop ourselves from making it bigger and more successful and more terrifying and more necessary  uber makes everything so easy  which means it shows us who  and what  we really are  it shows us how  whatever objections we might say we hold  we don   t actually care very much at all  we have our beliefs  our morals  our instincts  we have our dislike of douchebags  our mistrust of bad behavior  we have all that  but in the end  it turns out that if something   s    percent cheaper and   percent faster  we   ll give it all up quicker than we can order a sandwich a previous version of this story forgot to state that andreessen horowitz is an investor in uber rival lyft  matter regrets not spotting the pink
