i quit my day job in june  my dreams have come true  i get to be a full time writer slash entrepreneur in case you have any doubt  that   s freaking fantastic it   s also kind of scary  i don   t have anything outside myself structuring my time  no one watching the clock  no one upset if i don   t show up in the morning  sure  i have a boss  the boss is me the boss has a tendency to agree that mid morning naps are a good thing  even when there is shit that needs to be done so  the boss   s boss  still me  came up with a system to make sure that i stay on track in this whole working writer brand new world i do these five things  every day  before lunch i think they   ll work for you  too just trust me on this one  start with a nice hot shower  but before you get out  ease the water temperature to cold  wake yourself up  sugar  you have a day ahead of you while you   re at it  get dressed  sure  you could spend all day in your pjs and throw on a pair of jeans when it   s time to pick the kids up from school  but it   s much easier to slip into a mid morning nap if that   s what you   re dressed for once your brisk shower has your brain operating  make a list  there are lots of ways to do this  use evernote  or trello  go old school and use a notebook  or a dry erase board  whatever works for you i like analog  so i keep my daily lists in a day at a glance planner  every morning  just make a list of the things you need to do that day  think about your goals and add the very next step you can take on each of them  it   s okay if you don   t get to every single item on your list  just writing it all down keeps you honest now pick a few of the items off your list and figure out how you   re going to get them done before lunch  i usually choose five  i write them on sticky notes and stick them on my   before lunch doohickey  yes  that   s a technical term if you want your own doohickey  click here and i   ll send you one stat i don   t care how you do it  listen to a podcast on your way to work  keep a paperback in the bathroom  go to a matinee  catch up on your dvr  talk to the barista who makes your vanilla latte sometime before lunch  take in a story  open yourself to it  lose yourself in it  even if it   s ten minutes  give yourself over to really immersing yourself in a story sometime before lunch i understand that telling you to watch a movie or some television before lunch isn   t exactly traditional productivity advice  you probably don   t to make those your go to  but sometimes sometimes that kind of indulgence is just what you need i promise         getting your story fix will ignite your imagination and creativity  open those floodgates  and anything is possible remember the list  make sure that you   re not making yourself so busy with things that aren   t related to your biggest  hairiest  scariest goal that you   re just letting that one slide by don   t be the person who is going to do something great         tomorrow it can be so easy to not do the scary thing  i   m talking about your true north thing  the thing that you know is important by virtue of how terrifying it is for a few minutes  ignore the voice that says  of course you can   t do that right now  not when you have so much else going on do one thing about that goal before lunch  everyday  see what happens want to reduce the stress in your life  get rid of the stress that comes with standing in you kitchen  surrounded by hungry natives  even if you   re the only hungry native in your kitchen   with no clue what you   re going to feed them decide what you   re going to have for dinner tonight  before lunch  it   s okay if the answer is del taco or a pizza  sometimes  it just is  i get it  but make it a choice  not a desperate act of self preservation you   ll have fewer    cent tacos in your life if you think about dinner before lunch everyday  because you can get a head start  chop some veggies  maybe  throw something in the slow cooker i do this meal planning thing  it works  like  really  really works think about it  if you save ten minutes a day and you use them to write one page of your book         you   ll have your first draft done in a year  do that a few more times  and you   re a novelist all because you thought about dinner before lunch  powerful stuff if you enjoyed this post  please consider scrolling down and recommending it by clicking the pretty green heart shaunta grimes is a writer and teacher  she lives in reno with her husband  three superstar kids  and a yellow rescue dog named maybelline scout  she   s on twitter  shauntagrimes  is the author of viral nation and rebel nation  and is the original ninja writer want to be a ninja writer  follow the white rabbit  http   bit ly   daysnw
