PROLOGUE

<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
The
comet’s
tail
spread
across
the
dawn,
a
red
slash
that
bled
above
the
crags
of
Dragonstone
like
a
wound
in
the
pink
and
purple
sky.

The
maester
stood
on
the
windswept
balcony
outside
his
chambers.
It
was
here
the
ravens
came,
after
long
flight.
Their
droppings
speckled
the
gargoyles
that
rose
twelve
feet
tall
on
either
side
of
him,
a
hellhound
and
a
wyvern,
two
of
the
thousand
that
brooded
over
the
walls
of
the
ancient
fortress.
When
first
he
came
to
Dragonstone,
the
army
of
stone
grotesques
had
made
him
uneasy,
but
as
the
years
passed
he
had
grown
used
to
them.
Now
he
thought
of
them
as
old
friends.
The
three
of
them
watched
the
sky
together
with
foreboding.

The
maester
did
not
believe
in
omens.
And
yet…
old
as
he
was,
Cressen
had
never
seen
a
comet
half
so
bright,
nor
yet
that
color,
that
terrible
color,
the
color
of
blood
and
flame
and
sunsets.
He
wondered
if
his
gargoyles
had
ever
seen
its
like.
They
had
been
here
so
much
longer
than
he
had,
and
would
still
be
here
long
after
he
was
gone.
If
stone
tongues
could
speak…

Such
folly.
He
leaned
against
the
battlement,
the
sea
crashing
beneath
him,
the
black
stone
rough
beneath
his
fingers.
Talking
gargoyles
and
prophecies
in
the
sky.
I
am
an
old
done
man,
grown
giddy
as
a
child
again.
Had
a
lifetime’s
hard-won
wisdom
fled
him
along
with
his
health
and
strength?
He
was
a
maester,
trained
and
chained
in
the
great
Citadel
of
Oldtown.
What
had
he
come
to,
when
superstition
filled
his
head
as
if
he
were
an
ignorant
fieldhand?

And
yet…
and
yet…
the
comet
burned
even
by
day
now,
while
pale
grey
steam
rose
from
the
hot
vents
of
Dragonmont
behind
the
castle,
and
yestermorn
a
white
raven
had
brought
word
from
the
Citadel
itself,
word
long-expected
but
no
less
fearful
for
all
that,
word
of
summer’s
end.
Omens,
all.
Too
many
to
deny.
What
does
it
all
mean?
he
wanted
to
cry.

“Maester
Cressen,
we
have
visitors.”
Pylos
spoke
softly,
as
if
loath
to
disturb
Cressen’s
solemn
meditations.
Had
he
known
what
drivel
filled
his
head,
he
would
have
shouted.
“The
princess
would
see
the
white
raven.”
Ever
correct,
Pylos
called
her
princess
now,
as
her
lord
father
was
a
king.
King
of
a
smoking
rock
in
the
great
salt
sea,
yet
a
king
nonetheless.
“Her
fool
is
with
her.”

The
old
man
turned
away
from
the
dawn,
keeping
a
hand
on
his
wyvern
to
steady
himself.
“Help
me
to
my
chair
and
show
them
in.”

Taking
his
arm,
Pylos
led
him
inside.
In
his
youth,
Cressen
had
walked
briskly,
but
he
was
not
far
from
his
eightieth
name
day
now,
and
his
legs
were
frail
and
unsteady.
Two
years
past,
he
had
fallen
and
shattered
a
hip,
and
it
had
never
mended
properly.
Last
year
when
he
took
ill,
the
Citadel
had
sent
Pylos
out
from
Oldtown,
mere
days
before
Lord
Stannis
had
closed
the
isle…
to
help
him
in
his
labors,
it
was
said,
but
Cressen
knew
the
truth.
Pylos
had
come
to
replace
him
when
he
died.
He
did
not
mind.
Someone
must
take
his
place,
and
sooner
than
he
would
like…

He
let
the
younger
man
settle
him
behind
his
books
and
papers.
“Go
bring
her.
It
is
ill
to
keep
a
lady
waiting.”
He
waved
a
hand,
a
feeble
gesture
of
haste
from
a
man
no
longer
capable
of
hastening.
His
flesh
was
wrinkled
and
spotted,
the
skin
so
papery
thin
that
he
could
see
the
web
of
veins
and
the
shape
of
bones
beneath.
And
how
they
trembled,
these
hands
of
his
that
had
once
been
so
sure
and
deft…

When
Pylos
returned
the
girl
came
with
him,
shy
as
ever.
Behind
her,
shuffling
and
hopping
in
that
queer
sideways
walk
of
his,
came
her
fool.
On
his
head
was
a
mock
helm
fashioned
from
an
old
tin
bucket,
with
a
rack
of
deer
antlers
strapped
to
the
crown
and
hung
with
cowbells.
With
his
every
lurching
step,
the
bells
rang,
each
with
a
different
voice,
clang-a-dang
bong-dong
ring-a-ling
clong
clong
clong.

“Who
comes
to
see
us
so
early,
Pylos?”
Cressen
said.

“It’s
me
and
Patches,
Maester.”
Guileless
blue
eyes
blinked
at
him.
Hers
was
not
a
pretty
face,
alas.
The
child
had
her
lord
father’s
square
jut
of
jaw
and
her
mother’s
unfortunate
ears,
along
with
a
disfigurement
all
her
own,
the
legacy
of
the
bout
of
greyscale
that
had
almost
claimed
her
in
the
crib.
Across
half
one
cheek
and
well
down
her
neck,
her
flesh
was
stiff
and
dead,
the
skin
cracked
and
flaking,
mottled
black
and
grey
and
stony
to
the
touch.
“Pylos
said
we
might
see
the
white
raven.”

“Indeed
you
may,”
Cressen
answered.
As
if
he
would
ever
deny
her.
She
had
been
denied
too
often
in
her
time.
Her
name
was
Shireen.
She
would
be
ten
on
her
next
name
day,
and
she
was
the
saddest
child
that
Maester
Cressen
had
ever
known.
Her
sadness
is
my
shame,
the
old
man
thought,
another
mark
of
my
failure.
“Maester
Pylos,
do
me
a
kindness
and
bring
the
bird
down
from
the
rookery
for
the
Lady
Shireen.”

“It
would
be
my
pleasure.”
Pylos
was
a
polite
youth,
no
more
than
five-and-twenty,
yet
solemn
as
a
man
of
sixty.
If
only
he
had
more
humor,
more
life
in
him;
that
was
what
was
needed
here.
Grim
places
needed
lightening,
not
solemnity,
and
Dragonstone
was
grim
beyond
a
doubt,
a
lonely
citadel
in
the
wet
waste
surrounded
by
storm
and
salt,
with
the
smoking
shadow
of
the
mountain
at
its
back.
A
maester
must
go
where
he
is
sent,
so
Cressen
had
come
here
with
his
lord
some
twelve
years
past,
and
he
had
served,
and
served
well.
Yet
he
had
never
loved
Dragonstone,
nor
ever
felt
truly
at
home
here.
Of
late,
when
he
woke
from
restless
dreams
in
which
the
red
woman
figured
disturbingly,
he
often
did
not
know
where
he
was.

The
fool
turned
his
patched
and
piebald
head
to
watch
Pylos
climb
the
steep
iron
steps
to
the
rookery.
His
bells
rang
with
the
motion.
“Under
the
sea,
the
birds
have
scales
for
feathers,”
he
said,
clang-a-langing.
“I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

Even
for
a
fool,
Patchface
was
a
sorry
thing.
Perhaps
once
he
could
evoke
gales
of
laughter
with
a
quip,
but
the
sea
had
taken
that
power
from
him,
along
with
half
his
wits
and
all
his
memory.
He
was
soft
and
obese,
subject
to
twitches
and
trembles,
incoherent
as
often
as
not.
The
girl
was
the
only
one
who
laughed
at
him
now,
the
only
one
who
cared
if
he
lived
or
died.

An
ugly
little
girl
and
a
sad
fool,
and
maester
makes
three…
now
there
is
a
tale
to
make
men
weep.
“Sit
with
me,
child.”
Cressen
beckoned
her
closer.
“This
is
early
to
come
calling,
scarce
past
dawn.
You
should
be
snug
in
your
bed.”

“I
had
bad
dreams,”
Shireen
told
him.
“About
the
dragons.
They
were
coming
to
eat
me.”

The
child
had
been
plagued
by
nightmares
as
far
back
as
Maester
Cressen
could
recall.
“We
have
talked
of
this
before,”
he
said
gently.
“The
dragons
cannot
come
to
life.
They
are
carved
of
stone,
child.
In
olden
days,
our
island
was
the
westernmost
outpost
of
the
great
Freehold
of
Valyria.
It
was
the
Valyrians
who
raised
this
citadel,
and
they
had
ways
of
shaping
stone
since
lost
to
us.
A
castle
must
have
towers
wherever
two
walls
meet
at
an
angle,
for
defense.
The
Valyrians
fashioned
these
towers
in
the
shape
of
dragons
to
make
their
fortress
seem
more
fearsome,
just
as
they
crowned
their
walls
with
a
thousand
gargoyles
instead
of
simple
crenellations.”
He
took
her
small
pink
hand
in
his
own
frail
spotted
one
and
gave
it
a
gentle
squeeze.
“So
you
see,
there
is
nothing
to
fear.
“

Shireen
was
unconvinced.
“What
about
the
thing
in
the
sky?
Dalla
and
Matrice
were
talking
by
the
well,
and
Dalla
said
she
heard
the
red
woman
tell
Mother
that
it
was
dragonsbreath.
If
the
dragons
are
breathing,
doesn’t
that
mean
they
are
coming
to
life?”

The
red
woman,
Maester
Cressen
thought
sourly.
Ill
enough
that
she’s
filled
the
head
of
the
mother
with
her
madness,
must
she
poison
the
daughter’s
dreams
as
well?
He
would
have
a
stern
word
with
Dalla,
warn
her
not
to
spread
such
tales.
“The
thing
in
the
sky
is
a
comet,
sweet
child.
A
star
with
a
tail,
lost
in
the
heavens.
It
will
be
gone
soon
enough,
never
to
be
seen
again
in
our
lifetimes.
Watch
and
see.”

Shireen
gave
a
brave
little
nod.
“Mother
said
the
white
raven
means
it’s
not
summer
anymore.”

“That
is
so,
my
lady.
The
white
ravens
fly
only
from
the
Citadel.”
Cressen’s
fingers
went
to
the
chain
about
his
neck,
each
link
forged
from
a
different
metal,
each
symbolizing
his
mastery
of
another
branch
of
learning;
the
maester’s
collar,
mark
of
his
order.
In
the
pride
of
his
youth,
he
had
worn
it
easily,
but
now
it
seemed
heavy
to
him,
the
metal
cold
against
his
skin.
“They
are
larger
than
other
ravens,
and
more
clever,
bred
to
carry
only
the
most
important
messages.
This
one
came
to
tell
us
that
the
Conclave
has
met,
considered
the
reports
and
measurements
made
by
maesters
all
over
the
realm,
and
declared
this
great
summer
done
at
last.
Ten
years,
two
turns,
and
sixteen
days
it
lasted,
the
longest
summer
in
living
memory.”

“Will
it
get
cold
now?”
Shireen
was
a
summer
child,
and
had
never
known
true
cold.

“In
time,”
Cressen
replied.
“If
the
gods
are
good,
they
will
grant
us
a
warm
autumn
and
bountiful
harvests,
so
we
might
prepare
for
the
winter
to
come.”
The
smallfolk
said
that
a
long
summer
meant
an
even
longer
winter,
but
the
maester
saw
no
reason
to
frighten
the
child
with
such
tales.

Patchface
rang
his
bells.
“It
is
always
summer
under
the
sea,”
he
intoned.
“The
merwives
wear
nennymoans
in
their
hair
and
weave
gowns
of
silver
seaweed.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

Shireen
giggled.
“I
should
like
a
gown
of
silver
seaweed.”

“Under
the
sea,
it
snows
up,”
said
the
fool,
“and
the
rain
is
dry
as
bone.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

“Will
it
truly
snow?”
the
child
asked.

“It
will,”
Cressen
said.
But
not
for
years
yet,
I
pray,
and
then
not
for
long.
“Ah,
here
is
Pylos
with
the
bird.”

Shireen
gave
a
cry
of
delight.
Even
Cressen
had
to
admit
the
bird
made
an
impressive
sight,
white
as
snow
and
larger
than
any
hawk,
with
the
bright
black
eyes
that
meant
it
was
no
mere
albino,
but
a
truebred
white
raven
of
the
Citadel.
“Here,”
he
called.
The
raven
spread
its
wings,
leapt
into
the
air,
and
flapped
noisily
across
the
room
to
land
on
the
table
beside
him.

“I’ll
see
to
your
breakfast
now,”
Pylos
announced.
Cressen
nodded.
“This
is
the
Lady
Shireen,”
he
told
the
raven.
The
bird
bobbed
its
pale
head
up
and
down,
as
if
it
were
bowing.
“Lady,”
it
croaked.
“Lady.”

The
child’s
mouth
gaped
open.
“It
talks!”

“A
few
words.
As
I
said,
they
are
clever,
these
birds.”

“Clever
bird,
clever
man,
clever
clever
fool,”
said
Patchface,
jangling.
“Oh,
clever
clever
clever
fool.”
He
began
to
sing.
“The
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,”
he
sang,
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
back
again.
“The
shadows
come
to
stay,
my
lord,
stay
my
lord,
stay
my
lord.”
He
jerked
his
head
with
each
word,
the
bells
in
his
antlers
sending
up
a
clangor.

The
white
raven
screamed
and
went
flapping
away
to
perch
on
the
iron
railing
of
the
rookery
stairs.
Shireen
seemed
to
grow
smaller.
“He
sings
that
all
the
time.
I
told
him
to
stop
but
he
won’t.
It
makes
me
scared.
Make
him
stop.”

And
how
do
I
do
that?
the
old
man
wondered.
Once
I
might
have
silenced
him
forever,
but
now…

Patchface
had
come
to
them
as
a
boy.
Lord
Steffon
of
cherished
memory
had
found
him
in
Volantis,
across
the
narrow
sea.
The
king—the
old
king,
Aerys
II
Targaryen,
who
had
not
been
quite
so
mad
in
those
days—had
sent
his
lordship
to
seek
a
bride
for
Prince
Rhaegar,
who
had
no
sisters
to
wed.
“We
have
found
the
most
splendid
fool,”
he
wrote
Cressen,
a
fortnight
before
he
was
to
return
home
from
his
fruitless
mission.
“Only
a
boy,
yet
nimble
as
a
monkey
and
witty
as
a
dozen
courtiers.
He
juggles
and
riddles
and
does
magic,
and
he
can
sing
prettily
in
four
tongues.
We
have
bought
his
freedom
and
hope
to
bring
him
home
with
us.
Robert
will
be
delighted
with
him,
and
perhaps
in
time
he
will
even
teach
Stannis
how
to
laugh.”

It
saddened
Cressen
to
remember
that
letter.
No
one
had
ever
taught
Stannis
how
to
laugh,
least
of
all
the
boy
Patchface.
The
storm
came
up
suddenly,
howling,
and
Shipbreaker
Bay
proved
the
truth
of
its
name.
The
lord’s
two-masted
galley
Windproud
broke
up
within
sight
of
his
castle.
From
its
parapets
his
two
eldest
sons
had
watched
as
their
father’s
ship
was
smashed
against
the
rocks
and
swallowed
by
the
waters.
A
hundred
oarsmen
and
sailors
went
down
with
Lord
Steffon
Baratheon
and
his
lady
wife,
and
for
days
thereafter
every
tide
left
a
fresh
crop
of
swollen
corpses
on
the
strand
below
Storm’s
End.

The
boy
washed
up
on
the
third
day.
Maester
Cressen
had
come
down
with
the
rest,
to
help
put
names
to
the
dead.
When
they
found
the
fool
he
was
naked,
his
skin
white
and
wrinkled
and
powdered
with
wet
sand.
Cressen
had
thought
him
another
corpse,
but
when
Jommy
grabbed
his
ankles
to
drag
him
off
to
the
burial
wagon,
the
boy
coughed
water
and
sat
up.
To
his
dying
day,
Jommy
had
sworn
that
Patchface’s
flesh
was
clammy
cold.

No
one
ever
explained
those
two
days
the
fool
had
been
lost
in
the
sea.
The
fisherfolk
liked
to
say
a
mermaid
had
taught
him
to
breathe
water
in
return
for
his
seed.
Patchface
himself
had
said
nothing.
The
witty,
clever
lad
that
Lord
Steffon
had
written
of
never
reached
Storm’s
End;
the
boy
they
found
was
someone
else,
broken
in
body
and
mind,
hardly
capable
of
speech,
much
less
of
wit.
Yet
his
fool’s
face
left
no
doubt
of
who
he
was.
It
was
the
fashion
in
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
to
tattoo
the
faces
of
slaves
and
servants;
from
neck
to
scalp
the
boy’s
skin
had
been
patterned
in
squares
of
red
and
green
motley.

“The
wretch
is
mad,
and
in
pain,
and
no
use
to
anyone,
least
of
all
himself,”
declared
old
Ser
Harbert,
the
castellan
of
Storm’s
End
in
those
years.
“The
kindest
thing
you
could
do
for
that
one
is
fill
his
cup
with
the
milk
of
the
poppy.
A
painless
sleep,
and
there’s
an
end
to
it.
He’d
bless
you
if
he
had
the
wit
for
it.”
But
Cressen
had
refused,
and
in
the
end
he
had
won.
Whether
Patchface
had
gotten
any
joy
of
that
victory
he
could
not
say,
not
even
today,
so
many
years
later.

“The
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,”
the
fool
sang
on,
swinging
his
head
and
making
his
bells
clang
and
clatter.
Bong
dong,
ring-a-ling,
bong
dong.

“Lord,”
the
white
raven
shrieked.
“Lord,
lord,
lord.”

“A
fool
sings
what
he
will,”
the
maester
told
his
anxious
princess.
“You
must
not
take
his
words
to
heart.
On
the
morrow
he
may
remember
another
song,
and
this
one
will
never
be
heard
again.”
He
can
sing
prettily
in
four
tongues,
Lord
Steffon
had
written…

Pylos
strode
through
the
door.
“Maester,
pardons.”

“You
have
forgotten
the
porridge,”
Cressen
said,
amused.
That
was
most
unlike
Pylos.

“Maester,
Ser
Davos
returned
last
night.
They
were
talking
of
it
in
the
kitchen.
I
thought
you
would
want
to
know
at
once.”

“Davos…
last
night,
you
say?
Where
is
he?”

“With
the
king.
They
have
been
together
most
of
the
night.”

There
was
a
time
when
Lord
Stannis
would
have
woken
him,
no
matter
the
hour,
to
have
him
there
to
give
his
counsel.
“I
should
have
been
told,”
Cressen
complained.
“I
should
have
been
woken.”
He
disentangled
his
fingers
from
Shireen’s.
“Pardons,
my
lady,
but
I
must
speak
with
your
lord
father.
Pylos,
give
me
your
arm.
There
are
too
many
steps
in
this
castle,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
add
a
few
every
night,
just
to
vex
me.”

Shireen
and
Patchface
followed
them
out,
but
the
child
soon
grew
restless
with
the
old
man’s
creeping
pace
and
dashed
ahead,
the
fool
lurching
after
her
with
his
cowbells
clanging
madly.

Castles
are
not
friendly
places
for
the
frail,
Cressen
was
reminded
as
he
descended
the
turnpike
stairs
of
Sea
Dragon
Tower.
Lord
Stannis
would
be
found
in
the
Chamber
of
the
Painted
Table,
atop
the
Stone
Drum,
Dragonstone’s
central
keep,
so
named
for
the
way
its
ancient
walls
boomed
and
rumbled
during
storms.
To
reach
him
they
must
cross
the
gallery,
pass
through
the
middle
and
inner
walls
with
their
guardian
gargoyles
and
black
iron
gates,
and
ascend
more
steps
than
Cressen
cared
to
contemplate.
Young
men
climbed
steps
two
at
a
time;
for
old
men
with
bad
hips,
every
one
was
a
torment.
But
Lord
Stannis
would
not
think
to
come
to
him,
so
the
maester
resigned
himself
to
the
ordeal.
He
had
Pylos
to
help
him,
at
the
least,
and
for
that
he
was
grateful.

Shuffling
along
the
gallery,
they
passed
before
a
row
of
tall
arched
windows
with
commanding
views
of
the
outer
bailey,
the
curtain
wall,
and
the
fishing
village
beyond.
In
the
yard,
archers
were
firing
at
practice
butts
to
the
call
of
“Notch,
draw,
loose.”
Their
arrows
made
a
sound
like
a
flock
of
birds
taking
wing.
Guardsmen
strode
the
wallwalks,
peering
between
the
gargoyles
on
the
host
camped
without.
The
morning
air
was
hazy
with
the
smoke
of
cookfires,
as
three
thousand
men
sat
down
to
break
their
fasts
beneath
the
banners
of
their
lords.
Past
the
sprawl
of
the
camp,
the
anchorage
was
crowded
with
ships.
No
craft
that
had
come
within
sight
of
Dragonstone
this
past
half
year
had
been
allowed
to
leave
again.
Lord
Stannis’s
Fury,
a
triple-decked
war
galley
of
three
hundred
oars,
looked
almost
small
beside
some
of
the
big-bellied
carracks
and
cogs
that
surrounded
her.

The
guardsmen
outside
the
Stone
Drum
knew
the
maesters
by
sight,
and
passed
them
through.
“Wait
here,”
Cressen
told
Pylos,
within.
“It’s
best
I
see
him
alone.”

“It
is
a
long
climb,
Maester.”

Cressen
smiled.
“You
think
I
have
forgotten?
I
have
climbed
these
steps
so
often
I
know
each
one
by
name.”

Halfway
up,
he
regretted
his
decision.
He
had
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
and
ease
the
pain
in
his
hip
when
he
heard
the
scuff
of
boots
on
stone,
and
came
face-to-face
with
Ser
Davos
Seaworth,
descending.

Davos
was
a
slight
man,
his
low
birth
written
plain
upon
a
common
face.
A
well-worn
green
cloak,
stained
by
salt
and
spray
and
faded
from
the
sun,
draped
his
thin
shoulders,
over
brown
doublet
and
breeches
that
matched
brown
eyes
and
hair.
About
his
neck
a
pouch
of
worn
leather
hung
from
a
thong.
His
small
beard
was
well
peppered
with
grey,
and
he
wore
a
leather
glove
on
his
maimed
left
hand.
When
he
saw
Cressen,
he
checked
his
descent.

“Ser
Davos,”
the
maester
said.
“When
did
you
return?”

“In
the
black
of
morning.
My
favorite
time.”
It
was
said
that
no
one
had
ever
handled
a
ship
by
night
half
so
well
as
Davos
Shorthand.
Before
Lord
Stannis
had
knighted
him,
he
had
been
the
most
notorious
and
elusive
smuggler
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

“And?”

The
man
shook
his
head.
“It
is
as
you
warned
him.
They
will
not
rise,
Maester.
Not
for
him.
They
do
not
love
him.”

No,
Cressen
thought.
Nor
will
they
ever.
He
is
strong,
able,
just…
aye,
just
past
the
point
of
wisdom…
yet
it
is
not
enough.
It
has
never
been
enough.
“You
spoke
to
them
all?”

“All?
No.
Only
those
that
would
see
me.
They
do
not
love
me
either,
these
highborns.
To
them
I’ll
always
be
the
Onion
Knight.”
His
left
hand
closed,
stubby
fingers
locking
into
a
fist;
Stannis
had
hacked
the
ends
off
at
the
last
joint,
all
but
the
thumb.
“I
broke
bread
with
Gulian
Swann
and
old
Penrose,
and
the
Tarths
consented
to
a
midnight
meeting
in
a
grove.
The
others—well,
Beric
Dondarrion
is
gone
missing,
some
say
dead,
and
Lord
Caron
is
with
Renly.
Bryce
the
Orange,
of
the
Rainbow
Guard.”

“The
Rainbow
Guard?”

“Renly’s
made
his
own
Kingsguard,”
the
onetime
smuggler
explained,
“but
these
seven
don’t
wear
white.
Each
one
has
his
own
color.
Loras
Tyrell’s
their
Lord
Commander.”

It
was
just
the
sort
of
notion
that
would
appeal
to
Renly
Baratheon;
a
splendid
new
order
of
knighthood,
with
gorgeous
new
raiment
to
proclaim
it.
Even
as
a
boy,
Renly
had
loved
bright
colors
and
rich
fabrics,
and
he
had
loved
his
games
as
well.
“Look
at
me!”
he
would
shout
as
he
ran
laughing
through
the
halls
of
Storm’s
End.
“Look
at
me,
I’m
a
dragon,”
or
“Look
at
me,
I’m
a
wizard,”
or
“Look
at
me,
look
at
me,
I’m
the
rain
god.”

The
bold
little
boy
with
wild
black
hair
and
laughing
eyes
was
a
man
grown
now,
one-and-twenty,
and
still
he
played
his
games.
Look
at
me,
I’m
a
king,
Cressen
thought
sadly.
Oh,
Renly,
Renly,
dear
sweet
child,
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
And
would
you
care
if
you
did?
Is
there
anyone
who
cares
for
him
but
me?
“What
reasons
did
the
lords
give
for
their
refusals?”
he
asked
Ser
Davos.

“Well,
as
to
that,
some
gave
me
soft
words
and
some
blunt,
some
made
excuses,
some
promises,
some
only
lied.”
He
shrugged.
“In
the
end
words
are
just
wind.”

“You
could
bring
him
no
hope?”

“Only
the
false
sort,
and
I’d
not
do
that,”
Davos
said.
“He
had
the
truth
from
me.”

Maester
Cressen
remembered
the
day
Davos
had
been
knighted,
after
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End.
Lord
Stannis
and
a
small
garrison
had
held
the
castle
for
close
to
a
year,
against
the
great
host
of
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne.
Even
the
sea
was
closed
against
them,
watched
day
and
night
by
Redwyne
galleys
flying
the
burgundy
banners
of
the
Arbor.
Within
Storm’s
End,
the
horses
had
long
since
been
eaten,
the
dogs
and
cats
were
gone,
and
the
garrison
was
down
to
roots
and
rats.
Then
came
a
night
when
the
moon
was
new
and
black
clouds
hid
the
stars.
Cloaked
in
that
darkness,
Davos
the
smuggler
had
dared
the
Redwyne
cordon
and
the
rocks
of
Shipbreaker
Bay
alike.
His
little
ship
had
a
black
hull,
black
sails,
black
oars,
and
a
hold
crammed
with
onions
and
salt
fish.
Little
enough,
yet
it
had
kept
the
garrison
alive
long
enough
for
Eddard
Stark
to
reach
Storm’s
End
and
break
the
siege.

Lord
Stannis
had
rewarded
Davos
with
choice
lands
on
Cape
Wrath,
a
small
keep,
and
a
knight’s
honors…
but
he
had
also
decreed
that
he
lose
a
joint
of
each
finger
on
his
left
hand,
to
pay
for
all
his
years
of
smuggling.
Davos
had
submitted,
on
the
condition
that
Stannis
wield
the
knife
himself;
he
would
accept
no
punishment
from
lesser
hands.
The
lord
had
used
a
butcher’s
cleaver,
the
better
to
cut
clean
and
true.
Afterward,
Davos
had
chosen
the
name
Seaworth
for
his
new-made
house,
and
he
took
for
his
banner
a
black
ship
on
a
pale
grey
field—with
an
onion
on
its
sails.
The
onetime
smuggler
was
fond
of
saying
that
Lord
Stannis
had
done
him
a
boon,
by
giving
him
four
less
fingernails
to
clean
and
trim.

No,
Cressen
thought,
a
man
like
that
would
give
no
false
hope,
nor
soften
a
hard
truth.
“Ser
Davos,
truth
can
be
a
bitter
draught,
even
for
a
man
like
Lord
Stannis.
He
thinks
only
of
returning
to
King’s
Landing
in
the
fullness
of
his
power,
to
tear
down
his
enemies
and
claim
what
is
rightfully
his.
Yet
now…”

“If
he
takes
this
meager
host
to
King’s
Landing,
it
will
be
only
to
die.
He
does
not
have
the
numbers.
I
told
him
as
much,
but
you
know
his
pride.”
Davos
held
up
his
gloved
hand.
“My
fingers
will
grow
back
before
that
man
bends
to
sense.”

The
old
man
sighed.
“You
have
done
all
you
could.
Now
I
must
add
my
voice
to
yours.”
Wearily,
he
resumed
his
climb.

Lord
Stannis
Baratheon’s
refuge
was
a
great
round
room
with
walls
of
bare
black
stone
and
four
tall
narrow
windows
that
looked
out
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass.
In
the
center
of
the
chamber
was
the
great
table
from
which
it
took
its
name,
a
massive
slab
of
carved
wood
fashioned
at
the
command
of
Aegon
Targaryen
in
the
days
before
the
Conquest.
The
Painted
Table
was
more
than
fifty
feet
long,
perhaps
half
that
wide
at
its
widest
point,
but
less
than
four
feet
across
at
its
narrowest.
Aegon’s
carpenters
had
shaped
it
after
the
land
of
Westeros,
sawing
out
each
bay
and
peninsula
until
the
table
nowhere
ran
straight.
On
its
surface,
darkened
by
near
three
hundred
years
of
varnish,
were
painted
the
Seven
Kingdoms
as
they
had
been
in
Aegon’s
day;
rivers
and
mountains,
castles
and
cities,
lakes
and
forests.

There
was
a
single
chair
in
the
room,
carefully
positioned
in
the
precise
place
that
Dragonstone
occupied
off
the
coast
of
Westeros,
and
raised
up
to
give
a
good
view
of
the
tabletop.
Seated
in
the
chair
was
a
man
in
a
tight-laced
leather
jerkin
and
breeches
of
roughspun
brown
wool.
When
Maester
Cressen
entered,
he
glanced
up.
“I
knew
you
would
come,
old
man,
whether
I
summoned
you
or
no.”
There
was
no
hint
of
warmth
in
his
voice;
there
seldom
was.

Stannis
Baratheon,
Lord
of
Dragonstone
and
by
the
grace
of
the
gods
rightful
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros,
was
broad
of
shoulder
and
sinewy
of
limb,
with
a
tightness
to
his
face
and
flesh
that
spoke
of
leather
cured
in
the
sun
until
it
was
as
tough
as
steel.
Hard
was
the
word
men
used
when
they
spoke
of
Stannis,
and
hard
he
was.
Though
he
was
not
yet
five-and-thirty,
only
a
fringe
of
thin
black
hair
remained
on
his
head,
circling
behind
his
ears
like
the
shadow
of
a
crown.
His
brother,
the
late
King
Robert,
had
grown
a
beard
in
his
final
years.
Maester
Cressen
had
never
seen
it,
but
they
said
it
was
a
wild
thing,
thick
and
flerce.
As
if
in
answer,
Stannis
kept
his
own
whiskers
cropped
tight
and
short.
They
lay
like
a
blue-black
shadow
across
his
square
jaw
and
the
bony
hollows
of
his
cheeks.
His
eyes
were
open
wounds
beneath
his
heavy
brows,
a
blue
as
dark
as
the
sea
by
night.
His
mouth
would
have
given
despair
to
even
the
drollest
of
fools;
it
was
a
mouth
made
for
frowns
and
scowls
and
sharply
worded
commands,
all
thin
pale
lips
and
clenched
muscles,
a
mouth
that
had
forgotten
how
to
smile
and
had
never
known
how
to
laugh.
Sometimes
when
the
world
grew
very
still
and
silent
of
a
night,
Maester
Cressen
fancied
he
could
hear
Lord
Stannis
grinding
his
teeth
half
a
castle
away.

“Once
you
would
have
woken
me,”
the
old
man
said.

“Once
you
were
young.
Now
you
are
old
and
sick,
and
need
your
sleep.”
Stannis
had
never
learned
to
soften
his
speech,
to
dissemble
or
flatter;
he
said
what
he
thought,
and
those
that
did
not
like
it
could
be
damned.
“I
knew
you’d
learn
what
Davos
had
to
say
soon
enough.
You
always
do,
don’t
you?”

“I
would
be
of
no
help
to
you
if
I
did
not,”
Cressen
said.
“I
met
Davos
on
the
stair.”

“And
he
told
all,
I
suppose?
I
should
have
had
the
man’s
tongue
shortened
along
with
his
fingers.”

“He
would
have
made
you
a
poor
envoy
then.”

“He
made
me
a
poor
envoy
in
any
case.
The
storm
lords
will
not
rise
for
me.
It
seems
they
do
not
like
me,
and
the
justice
of
my
cause
means
nothing
to
them.
The
cravenly
ones
will
sit
behind
their
walls
waiting
to
see
how
the
wind
rises
and
who
is
likely
to
triumph.
The
bold
ones
have
already
declared
for
Renly.
For
Renly!”
He
spat
out
the
name
like
poison
on
his
tongue.

“Your
brother
has
been
the
Lord
of
Storm’s
End
these
past
thirteen
years.
These
lords
are
his
sworn
bannermen—”

“His,”
Stannis
broke
in,
“when
by
rights
they
should
be
mine.
I
never
asked
for
Dragonstone.
I
never
wanted
it.
I
took
it
because
Robert’s
enemies
were
here
and
he
commanded
me
to
root
them
out.
I
built
his
fleet
and
did
his
work,
dutiful
as
a
younger
brother
should
be
to
an
elder,
as
Renly
should
be
to
me.
And
what
was
Robert’s
thanks?
He
names
me
Lord
of
Dragonstone,
and
gives
Storm’s
End
and
its
incomes
to
Renly.
Storm’s
End
belonged
to
House
Baratheon
for
three
hundred
years;
by
rights
it
should
have
passed
to
me
when
Robert
took
the
Iron
Throne.”

It
was
an
old
grievance,
deeply
felt,
and
never
more
so
than
now.
Here
was
the
heart
of
his
lord’s
weakness;
for
Dragonstone,
old
and
strong
though
it
was,
commanded
the
allegiance
of
only
a
handful
of
lesser
lords,
whose
stony
island
holdings
were
too
thinly
peopled
to
yield
up
the
men
that
Stannis
needed.
Even
with
the
sellswords
he
had
brought
across
the
narrow
sea
from
the
Free
Cities
of
Myr
and
Lys,
the
host
camped
outside
his
walls
was
far
too
small
to
bring
down
the
power
of
House
Lannister.

“Robert
did
you
an
injustice,”
Maester
Cressen
replied
carefully,
“yet
he
had
sound
reasons.
Dragonstone
had
long
been
the
seat
of
House
Targaryen.
He
needed
a
man’s
strength
to
rule
here,
and
Renly
was
but
a
child.”

“He
is
a
child
still,”
Stannis
declared,
his
anger
ringing
loud
in
the
empty
hall,
“a
thieving
child
who
thinks
to
snatch
the
crown
off
my
brow.
What
has
Renly
ever
done
to
earn
a
throne?
He
sits
in
council
and
jests
with
Littlefinger,
and
at
tourneys
he
dons
his
splendid
suit
of
armor
and
allows
himself
to
be
knocked
off
his
horse
by
a
better
man.
That
is
the
sum
of
my
brother
Renly,
who
thinks
he
ought
to
be
a
king.
I
ask
you,
why
did
the
gods
inflict
me
with
brothers?”

“I
cannot
answer
for
the
gods.”

“You
seldom
answer
at
all
these
days,
it
seems
to
me.
Who
maesters
for
Renly?
Perchance
I
should
send
for
him,
I
might
like
his
counsel
better.
What
do
you
think
this
maester
said
when
my
brother
decided
to
steal
my
crown?
What
counsel
did
your
colleague
offer
to
this
traitor
blood
of
mine?”

“It
would
surprise
me
if
Lord
Renly
sought
counsel,
Your
Grace.”
The
youngest
of
Lord
Steffon’s
three
sons
had
grown
into
a
man
bold
but
heedless,
who
acted
from
impulse
rather
than
calculation.
In
that,
as
in
so
much
else,
Renly
was
like
his
brother
Robert,
and
utterly
unlike
Stannis.

“Your
Grace,”
Stannis
repeated
bitterly.
“You
mock
me
with
a
king’s
style,
yet
what
am
I
king
of?
Dragonstone
and
a
few
rocks
in
the
narrow
sea,
there
is
my
kingdom.”
He
descended
the
steps
of
his
chair
to
stand
before
the
table,
his
shadow
falling
across
the
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
and
the
painted
forest
where
King’s
Landing
now
stood.
There
he
stood,
brooding
over
the
realm
he
sought
to
claim,
so
near
at
hand
and
yet
so
far
away.
“Tonight
I
am
to
sup
with
my
lords
bannermen,
such
as
they
are.
Celtigar,
Velaryon,
Bar
Emmon,
the
whole
paltry
lot
of
them.
A
poor
crop,
if
truth
be
told,
but
they
are
what
my
brothers
have
left
me.
That
Lysene
pirate
Salladhor
Saan
will
be
there
with
the
latest
tally
of
what
I
owe
him,
and
Morosh
the
Myrman
will
caution
me
with
talk
of
tides
and
autumn
gales,
while
Lord
Sunglass
mutters
piously
of
the
will
of
the
Seven.
Celtigar
will
want
to
know
which
storm
lords
are
joining
us.
Velaryon
will
threaten
to
take
his
levies
home
unless
we
strike
at
once.
What
am
I
to
tell
them?
What
must
I
do
now?”

“Your
true
enemies
are
the
Lannisters,
my
lord,”
Maester
Cressen
answered.
“If
you
and
your
brother
were
to
make
common
cause
against
them—”

“I
will
not
treat
with
Renly,”
Stannis
answered
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
argument.
“Not
while
he
calls
himself
a
king.”

“Not
Renly,
then,”
the
maester
yielded.
His
lord
was
stubborn
and
proud;
when
he
had
set
his
mind,
there
was
no
changing
it.
“Others
might
serve
your
needs
as
well.
Eddard
Stark’s
son
has
been
proclaimed
King
in
the
North,
with
all
the
power
of
Winterfell
and
Riverrun
behind
him.”

“A
green
boy,”
said
Stannis,
“and
another
false
king.
Am
I
to
accept
a
broken
realm?”

“Surely
half
a
kingdom
is
better
than
none,”
Cressen
said,
“and
if
you
help
the
boy
avenge
his
father’s
murder—”

“Why
should
I
avenge
Eddard
Stark?
The
man
was
nothing
to
me.
Oh,
Robert
loved
him,
to
be
sure.
Loved
him
as
a
brother,
how
often
did
I
hear
that?
I
was
his
brother,
not
Ned
Stark,
but
you
would
never
have
known
it
by
the
way
he
treated
me.
I
held
Storm’s
End
for
him,
watching
good
men
starve
while
Mace
Tyrell
and
Paxter
Redwyne
feasted
within
sight
of
my
walls.
Did
Robert
thank
me?
No.
He
thanked
Stark,
for
lifting
the
siege
when
we
were
down
to
rats
and
radishes.
I
built
a
fleet
at
Robert’s
command,
took
Dragonstone
in
his
name.
Did
he
take
my
hand
and
say,
Well
done,
brother,
whatever
should
I
do
without
you?
No,
he
blamed
me
for
letting
Willem
Darry
steal
away
Viserys
and
the
babe,
as
if
I
could
have
stopped
it.
I
sat
on
his
council
for
fifteen
years,
helping
Jon
Arryn
rule
his
realm
while
Robert
drank
and
whored,
but
when
Jon
died,
did
my
brother
name
me
his
Hand?
No,
he
went
galloping
off
to
his
dear
friend
Ned
Stark,
and
offered
him
the
honor.
And
small
good
it
did
either
of
them.
“

“Be
that
as
it
may,
my
lord,”
Maester
Cressen
said
gently.
“Great
wrongs
have
been
done
you,
but
the
past
is
dust.
The
future
may
yet
be
won
if
you
join
with
the
Starks.
There
are
others
you
might
sound
out
as
well.
What
of
Lady
Arryn?
If
the
queen
murdered
her
husband,
surely
she
will
want
justice
for
him.
She
has
a
young
son,
Jon
Arryn’s
heir.
If
you
were
to
betroth
Shireen
to
him—”

“The
boy
is
weak
and
sickly,”
Lord
Stannis
objected.
“Even
his
father
saw
how
it
was,
when
he
asked
me
to
foster
him
on
Dragonstone.
Service
as
a
page
might
have
done
him
good,
but
that
damnable
Lannister
woman
had
Lord
Arryn
poisoned
before
it
could
be
done,
and
now
Lysa
hides
him
in
the
Eyrie.
She’ll
never
part
with
the
boy,
I
promise
you
that.
“

“Then
you
must
send
Shireen
to
the
Eyrie,”
the
maester
urged.
“Dragonstone
is
a
grim
home
for
a
child.
Let
her
fool
go
with
her,
so
she
will
have
a
familiar
face
about
her.”

“Familiar
and
hideous.”
Stannis
furrowed
his
brow
in
thought.
“Still…
perhaps
it
is
worth
the
trying…

“Must
the
rightful
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
beg
for
help
from
widow
women
and
usurpers?”
a
woman’s
voice
asked
sharply.

Maester
Cressen
turned
sand
bowed
his
head.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
chagrined
that
he
had
not
heard
her
enter.

Lord
Stannis
scowled.
“I
do
not
beg.
Of
anyone.
Mind
you
remember
that,
woman.”

“I
am
pleased
to
hear
it,
my
lord.”
Lady
Selyse
was
as
tall
as
her
husband,
thin
of
body
and
thin
of
face,
with
prominent
ears,
a
sharp
nose,
and
the
faintest
hint
of
a
mustache
on
her
upper
lip.
She
plucked
it
daily
and
cursed
it
regularly,
yet
it
never
failed
to
return.
Her
eyes
were
pale,
her
mouth
stern,
her
voice
a
whip.
She
cracked
it
now.
“Lady
Arryn
owes
you
her
allegiance,
as
do
the
Starks,
your
brother
Renly,
and
all
the
rest.
You
are
their
one
true
king.
It
would
not
be
fitting
to
plead
and
bargain
with
them
for
what
is
rightfully
yours
by
the
grace
of
god.”

God,
she
said,
not
gods.
The
red
woman
had
won
her,
heart
and
soul,
turning
her
from
the
gods
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
both
old
and
new,
to
worship
the
one
they
called
the
Lord
of
Light.

“Your
god
can
keep
his
grace,”
said
Lord
Stannis,
who
did
not
share
his
wife’s
fervent
new
faith.
“It’s
swords
I
need,
not
blessings.
Do
you
have
an
army
hidden
somewhere
that
you’ve
not
told
me
of?”
There
was
no
affection
in
his
tone.
Stannis
had
always
been
uncomfortable
around
women,
even
his
own
wife.
When
he
had
gone
to
King’s
Landing
to
sit
on
Robert’s
council,
he
had
left
Selyse
on
Dragonstone
with
their
daughter.
His
letters
had
been
few,
his
visits
fewer;
he
did
his
duty
in
the
marriage
bed
once
or
twice
a
year,
but
took
no
joy
in
it,
and
the
sons
he
had
once
hoped
for
had
never
come.

“My
brothers
and
uncles
and
cousins
have
armies,”
she
told
him.
“House
Florent
will
rally
to
your
banner.”

“House
Florent
can
field
two
thousand
swords
at
best.”
It
was
said
that
Stannis
knew
the
strength
of
every
house
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
“And
you
have
a
deal
more
faith
in
your
brothers
and
uncles
than
I
do,
my
lady.
The
Florent
lands
lie
too
close
to
Highgarden
for
your
lord
uncle
to
risk
Mace
Tyrell’s
wrath.”

“There
is
another
way.”
Lady
Selyse
moved
closer.
“Look
out
your
windows,
my
lord.
There
is
the
sign
you
have
waited
for,
blazoned
on
the
sky.
Red,
it
is,
the
red
of
flame,
red
for
the
fiery
heart
of
the
true
god.
it
is
his
banner—and
yours!
See
how
it
unfurls
across
the
heavens
like
a
dragon’s
hot
breath,
and
you
the
Lord
of
Dragonstone.
It
means
your
time
has
come,
Your
Grace.
Nothing
is
more
certain.
You
are
meant
to
sail
from
this
desolate
rock
as
Aegon
the
Conqueror
once
sailed,
to
sweep
all
before
you
as
he
did.
Only
say
the
word,
and
embrace
the
power
of
the
Lord
of
Light.”

“How
many
swords
will
the
Lord
of
Light
put
into
my
hand?”
Stannis
demanded
again.

“All
you
need,”
his
wife
promised,
“The
swords
of
Storm’s
End
and
Highgarden
for
a
start,
and
all
their
lords
bannermen.”

“Davos
would
tell
you
different,”
Stannis
said.
“Those
swords
are
sworn
to
Renly.
They
love
my
charming
young
brother,
as
they
once
loved
Robert…
and
as
they
have
never
loved
me.”

“Yes,”
she
answered,
“but
if
Renly
should
die…”

Stannis
looked
at
his
lady
with
narrowed
eyes,
until
Cressen
could
not
hold
his
tongue.
“It
is
not
to
be
thought.
Your
Grace,
whatever
follies
Renly
has
committed—”

“Follies?
I
call
them
treasons.”
Stannis
turned
back
to
his
wife.
“My
brother
is
young
and
strong,
and
he
has
a
vast
host
around
him,
and
these
rainbow
knights
of
his.”

“Melisandre
has
gazed
into
the
flames,
and
seen
him
dead.”

Cressen
was
horrorstruck.
“Fratricide…
my
lord,
this
is
evil,
unthinkable…
please,
listen
to
me.”

Lady
Selyse
gave
him
a
measured
look.
“And
what
will
you
tell
him,
Maester?
How
he
might
win
half
a
kingdom
if
he
goes
to
the
Starks
on
his
knees
and
sells
our
daughter
to
Lysa
Arryn?”

“I
have
heard
your
counsel,
Cressen,”
Lord
Stannis
said.
“Now
I
will
hear
hers.
You
are
dismissed.”

Maester
Cressen
bent
a
stiff
knee.
He
could
feel
Lady
Selyse’s
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
shuffled
slowly
across
the
room.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
stand
erect.
“Help
me,”
he
said
to
Pylos.

When
he
was
safe
back
in
his
own
rooms,
Cressen
sent
the
younger
man
away
and
limped
to
his
balcony
once
more,
to
stand
between
his
gargoyles
and
stare
out
to
sea.
One
of
Salladhor
Saan’s
warships
was
sweeping
past
the
castle,
her
gaily
striped
hull
slicing
through
the
grey-green
waters
as
her
oars
rose
and
fell.
He
watched
until
she
vanished
behind
a
headland.
Would
that
my
fears
could
vanish
so
easily.
Had
he
lived
so
long
for
this?

When
a
maester
donned
his
collar,
he
put
aside
the
hope
of
children,
yet
Cressen
had
oft
felt
a
father
nonetheless.
Robert,
Stannis,
Renly…
three
sons
he
had
raised
after
the
angry
sea
claimed
Lord
Steffon.
Had
he
done
so
ill
that
now
he
must
watch
one
kill
the
other?
He
could
not
allow
it,
would
not
allow
it.

The
woman
was
the
heart
of
it.
Not
the
Lady
Selyse,
the
other
one.
The
red
woman,
the
servants
had
named
her,
afraid
to
speak
her
name.
“I
will
speak
her
name,”
Cressen
told
his
stone
hellhound.
“Melisandre.
Her.”
Melisandre
of
Asshai,
sorceress,
shadowbinder,
and
priestess
to
R’hllor,
the
Lord
of
Light,
the
Heart
of
Fire,
the
God
of
Flame
and
Shadow.
Melisandre,
whose
madness
must
not
be
allowed
to
spread
beyond
Dragonstone.

His
chambers
seemed
dim
and
gloomy
after
the
brightness
of
the
morning.
With
fumbling
hands,
the
old
man
lit
a
candle
and
carried
it
to
the
workroom
beneath
the
rookery
stair,
where
his
ointments,
potions,
and
medicines
stood
neatly
on
their
shelves.
On
the
bottom
shelf
behind
a
row
of
salves
in
squat
clay
jars
he
found
a
vial
of
indigo
glass,
no
larger
than
his
little
finger.
It
rattled
when
he
shook
it.
Cressen
blew
away
a
layer
of
dust
and
carried
it
back
to
his
table.
Collapsing
into
his
chair,
he
pulled
the
stopper
and
spilled
out
the
vial’s
contents.
A
dozen
crystals,
no
larger
than
seeds,
rattled
across
the
parchment
he’d
been
reading.
They
shone
like
jewels
in
the
candlelight,
so
purple
that
the
maester
found
himself
thinking
that
he
had
never
truly
seen
the
color
before.

The
chain
around
his
throat
felt
very
heavy.
He
touched
one
of
the
crystals
lightly
with
the
tip
of
his
little
finger.
Such
a
small
thing
to
hold
the
power
of
life
and
death.
It
was
made
from
a
certain
plant
that
grew
only
on
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
half
a
world
away.
The
leaves
had
to
be
aged,
and
soaked
in
a
wash
of
limes
and
sugar
water
and
certain
rare
spices
from
the
Summer
Isles.
Afterward
they
could
be
discarded,
but
the
potion
must
be
thickened
with
ash
and
allowed
to
crystallize.
The
process
was
slow
and
difficult,
the
necessaries
costly
and
hard
to
acquire.
The
alchemists
of
Lys
knew
the
way
of
it,
though,
and
the
Faceless
Men
of
Braavos…
and
the
maesters
of
his
order
as
well,
though
it
was
not
something
talked
about
beyond
the
walls
of
the
Citadel.
All
the
world
knew
that
a
maester
forged
his
silver
link
when
he
learned
the
art
of
healing—but
the
world
preferred
to
forget
that
men
who
knew
how
to
heal
also
knew
how
to
kill.

Cressen
no
longer
recalled
the
name
the
Asshai’i
gave
the
leaf,
or
the
Lysene
poisoners
the
crystal.
In
the
Citadel,
it
was
simply
called
the
strangler.
Dissolved
in
wine,
it
would
make
the
muscles
of
a
man’s
throat
clench
tighter
than
any
fist,
shutting
off
his
windpipe.
They
said
a
victim’s
face
turned
as
purple
as
the
little
crystal
seed
from
which
his
death
was
grown,
but
so
too
did
a
man
choking
on
a
morsel
of
food.

And
this
very
night
Lord
Stannis
would
feast
his
bannermen,
his
lady
wife…
and
the
red
woman,
Melisandre
of
Asshai.

I
must
rest,
Maester
Cressen
told
himself.
I
must
have
all
my
strength
come
dark.
My
hands
must
not
shake,
nor
my
courage
flag.
It
is
a
dreadful
thing
I
do,
yet
it
must
be
done.
If
there
are
gods,
surely
they
will
forgive
me.
He
had
slept
so
poorly
of
late.
A
nap
would
refresh
him
for
the
ordeal
ahead.
Wearily,
he
tottered
off
to
his
bed.
Yet
when
he
closed
his
eyes,
he
could
still
see
the
light
of
the
comet,
red
and
flery
and
vividly
alive
amidst
the
darkness
of
his
dreams.
Perhaps
it
is
my
comet,
he
thought
drowsily
at
the
last,
just
before
sleep
took
him.
An
omen
of
blood,
foretelling
murder…
yes…

When
he
woke
it
was
full
dark,
his
bedchamber
was
black,
and
every
joint
in
his
body
ached.
Cressen
pushed
himself
up,
his
head
throbbing.
Clutching
for
his
cane,
he
rose
unsteady
to
his
feet.
So
late,
he
thought.
They
did
not
summon
me.
He
was
always
summoned
for
feasts,
seated
near
the
salt,
close
to
Lord
Stannis.
His
lord’s
face
swam
up
before
him,
not
the
man
he
was
but
the
boy
he
had
been,
standing
cold
in
the
shadows
while
the
sun
shone
on
his
elder
brother.
Whatever
he
did,
Robert
had
done
first,
and
better.
Poor
boy…
he
must
hurry,
for
his
sake.

The
maester
found
the
crystals
where
he
had
left
them,
and
scooped
them
off
the
parchment.
Cressen
owned
no
hollow
rings,
such
as
the
poisoners
of
Lys
were
said
to
favor,
but
a
myriad
of
pockets
great
and
small
were
sewn
inside
the
loose
sleeves
of
his
robe.
He
secreted
the
strangler
seeds
in
one
of
them,
threw
open
his
door,
and
called,
“Pylos?
Where
are
you?”
When
he
heard
no
reply,
he
called
again,
louder.
“Pylos,
I
need
help.”
Still
there
came
no
answer.
That
was
queer;
the
young
maester
had
his
cell
only
a
half
turn
down
the
stair,
within
easy
earshot.

In
the
end,
Cressen
had
to
shout
for
the
servants.
“Make
haste,”
he
told
them.
“I
have
slept
too
long.
They
will
be
feasting
by
now…
drinking…
I
should
have
been
woken.”
What
had
happened
to
Maester
Pylos?
Truly,
he
did
not
understand.

Again
he
had
to
cross
the
long
gallery.
A
night
wind
whispered
through
the
great
windows,
sharp
with
the
smell
of
the
sea.
Torches
flickered
along
the
walls
of
Dragonstone,
and
in
the
camp
beyond,
he
could
see
hundreds
of
cookfires
burning,
as
if
a
field
of
stars
had
fallen
to
the
earth.
Above,
the
comet
blazed
red
and
malevolent.
I
am
too
old
and
wise
to
fear
such
things,
the
maester
told
himself.

The
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
were
set
in
the
mouth
of
a
stone
dragon.
He
told
the
servants
to
leave
him
outside.
It
would
be
better
to
enter
alone;
he
must
not
appear
feeble.
Leaning
heavily
on
his
cane,
Cressen
climbed
the
last
few
steps
and
hobbled
beneath
the
gateway
teeth.
A
pair
of
guardsmen
opened
the
heavy
red
doors
before
him,
unleashing
a
sudden
blast
of
noise
and
light.
Cressen
stepped
down
into
the
dragon’s
maw.

Over
the
clatter
of
knife
and
plate
and
the
low
mutter
of
table
talk,
he
heard
Patchface
singing,
“…dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,”
to
the
accompaniment
of
jangling
cowbells.
The
same
dreadful
song
he’d
sung
this
morning.
“The
shadows
come
to
stay,
my
lord,
stay
my
lord,
stay
my
lord.”
The
lower
tables
were
crowded
with
knights,
archers,
and
sellsword
captains,
tearing
apart
loaves
of
black
bread
to
soak
in
their
fish
stew.
Here
there
was
no
loud
laughter,
no
raucous
shouting
such
as
marred
the
dignity
of
other
men’s
feasts;
Lord
Stannis
did
not
permit
such.

Cressen
made
his
way
toward
the
raised
platform
where
the
lords
sat
with
the
king.
He
had
to
step
wide
around
Patchface.
Dancing,
his
bells
ringing,
the
fool
neither
saw
nor
heard
his
approach.
As
he
hopped
from
one
leg
to
the
other,
Patchface
lurched
into
Cressen,
knocking
his
cane
out
from
under
him.
They
went
crashing
down
together
amidst
the
rushes
in
a
tangle
of
arms
and
legs,
while
a
sudden
gale
of
laughter
went
up
around
them.
No
doubt
it
was
a
comical
sight.

Patchface
sprawled
half
on
top
of
him,
motley
fool’s
face
pressed
close
to
his
own.
He
had
lost
his
tin
helm
with
its
antlers
and
bells.
“Under
the
sea,
you
fall
up,”
he
declared.
“I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”
Giggling,
the
fool
rolled
off,
bounded
to
his
feet,
and
did
a
little
dance.

Trying
to
make
the
best
of
it,
the
maester
smiled
feebly
and
struggled
to
rise,
but
his
hip
was
in
such
pain
that
for
a
moment
he
was
half
afraid
that
he
had
broken
it
all
over
again.
He
felt
strong
hands
grasp
him
under
the
arms
and
lift
him
back
to
his
feet.
“Thank
you,
ser,”
he
murmured,
turning
to
see
which
knight
had
come
to
his
aid…

“Maester,”
said
Lady
Melisandre,
her
deep
voice
flavored
with
the
music
of
the
Jade
Sea.
“You
ought
take
more
care.”
As
ever,
she
wore
red
head
to
heel,
a
long
loose
gown
of
flowing
silk
as
bright
as
fire,
with
dagged
sleeves
and
deep
slashes
in
the
bodice
that
showed
glimpses
of
a
darker
bloodred
fabric
beneath.
Around
her
throat
was
a
red
gold
choker
tighter
than
any
maester’s
chain,
ornamented
with
a
single
great
ruby.

Her
hair
was
not
the
orange
or
strawberry
color
of
common
red-haired
men,
but
a
deep
burnished
copper
that
shone
in
the
light
of
the
torches.
Even
her
eyes
were
red…
but
her
skin
was
smooth
and
white,
unblemished,
pale
as
cream.
Slender
she
was,
graceful,
taller
than
most
knights,
with
full
breasts
and
narrow
waist
and
a
heart-shaped
face.
Men’s
eyes
that
once
found
her
did
not
quickly
look
away,
not
even
a
maester’s
eyes.
Many
called
her
beautiful.
She
was
not
beautiful.
She
was
red,
and
terrible,
and
red.

“I…
thank
you,
my
lady.”

“A
man
your
age
must
look
to
where
he
steps,”
Melisandre
said
courteously.
“The
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.”

He
knew
the
phrase,
some
prayer
of
her
faith.
It
makes
no
matter,
I
have
a
faith
of
my
own.
“Only
children
fear
the
dark,”
he
told
her.
Yet
even
as
he
said
the
words,
he
heard
Patchface
take
up
his
song
again.
“The
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord.”

“Now
here
is
a
riddle,”
Melisandre
said.
“A
clever
fool
and
a
foolish
wise
man.”
Bending,
she
picked
up
Patchface’s
helm
from
where
it
had
fallen
and
set
it
on
Cressen’s
head.
The
cowbells
rang
softly
as
the
tin
bucket
slid
down
over
his
ears.
“A
crown
to
match
your
chain,
Lord
Maester,”
she
announced.
All
around
them,
men
were
laughing.

Cressen
pressed
his
lips
together
and
fought
to
still
his
rage.
She
thought
he
was
feeble
and
helpless,
but
she
would
learn
otherwise
before
the
night
was
done.
Old
he
might
be,
yet
he
was
still
a
maester
of
the
Citadel.
“I
need
no
crown
but
truth,”
he
told
her,
removing
the
fool’s
helm
from
his
head.

“There
are
truths
in
this
world
that
are
not
taught
at
Oldtown.”
Melisandre
turned
from
him
in
a
swirl
of
red
silk
and
made
her
way
back
to
the
high
table,
where
King
Stannis
and
his
queen
were
seated.
Cressen
handed
the
antlered
tin
bucket
back
to
Patchface,
and
made
to
follow.

Maester
Pylos
sat
in
his
place.

The
old
man
could
only
stop
and
stare.
“Maester
Pylos,”
he
said
at
last.
“You…
you
did
not
wake
me.”

“His
Grace
commanded
me
to
let
you
rest.”
Pylos
had
at
least
the
grace
to
blush.
“He
told
me
you
were
not
needed
here.”

Cressen
looked
over
the
knights
and
captains
and
lords
sitting
silent.
Lord
Celtigar,
aged
and
sour,
wore
a
mantle
patterned
with
red
crabs
picked
out
in
garnets.
Handsome
Lord
Velaryon
chose
sea-green
silk,
the
white
gold
seahorse
at
his
throat
matching
his
long
fair
hair.
Lord
Bar
Emmon,
that
plump
boy
of
fourteen,
was
swathed
in
purple
velvet
trimmed
with
white
seal,
Ser
Axell
Florent
remained
homely
even
in
russet
and
fox
fur,
pious
Lord
Sunglass
wore
moonstones
at
throat
and
wrist
and
finger,
and
the
Lysene
captain
Salladhor
Saan
was
a
sunburst
of
scarlet
satin,
gold,
and
jewels.
Only
Ser
Davos
dressed
simply,
in
brown
doublet
and
green
wool
mantle,
and
only
Ser
Davos
met
his
gaze,
with
pity
in
his
eyes.

“You
are
too
ill
and
too
confused
to
be
of
use
to
me,
old
man.”
It
sounded
so
like
Lord
Stannis’s
voice,
but
it
could
not
be,
it
could
not.
“Pylos
will
counsel
me
henceforth.
Already
he
works
with
the
ravens,
since
you
can
no
longer
climb
to
the
rookery.
I
will
not
have
you
kill
yourself
in
my
service.”

Maester
Cressen
blinked.
Stannis,
my
lord,
my
sad
sullen
boy,
son
I
never
had,
you
must
not
do
this,
don’t
you
know
how
I
have
cared
for
you,
lived
for
you,
loved
you
despite
all?
Yes,
loved
you,
better
than
Robert
even,
or
Renly,
for
you
were
the
one
unloved,
the
one
who
needed
me
most.
Yet
all
he
said
was,
“As
you
command,
my
lord,
but…
but
I
am
hungry.
Might
not
I
have
a
place
at
your
table?”
At
your
side,
I
belong
at
your
side…

Ser
Davos
rose
from
the
bench.
“I
should
be
honored
if
the
maester
would
sit
here
beside
me,
Your
Grace.”

“As
you
will.”
Lord
Stannis
turned
away
to
say
something
to
Melisandre,
who
had
seated
herself
at
his
right
hand,
in
the
place
of
high
honor.
Lady
Selyse
was
on
his
left,
flashing
a
smile
as
bright
and
brittle
as
her
jewels.

Too
far,
Cressen
thought
dully,
looking
at
where
Ser
Davos
was
seated.
Half
of
the
lords
bannermen
were
between
the
smuggler
and
the
high
table.
I
must
be
closer
to
her
if
I
am
to
get
the
strangler
into
her
cup,
yet
how?

Patchface
was
capering
about
as
the
maester
made
his
slow
way
around
the
table
to
Davos
Seaworth.
“Here
we
eat
fish,”
the
fool
declared
happily,
waving
a
cod
about
like
a
scepter.
“Under
the
sea,
the
fish
eat
us.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

Ser
Davos
moved
aside
to
make
room
on
the
bench.
“We
all
should
be
in
motley
tonight,”
he
said
gloomily
as
Cressen
seated
himself,
“for
this
is
fool’s
business
we’re
about.
The
red
woman
has
seen
victory
in
her
flames,
so
Stannis
means
to
press
his
claim,
no
matter
what
the
numbers.
Before
she’s
done
we’re
all
like
to
see
what
Patchface
saw,
I
fear—the
bottom
of
the
sea.”

Cressen
slid
his
hands
up
into
his
sleeves
as
if
for
warmth.
His
fingers
found
the
hard
lumps
the
crystals
made
in
the
wool.
“Lord
Stannis.”

Stannis
turned
from
the
red
woman,
but
it
was
Lady
Selyse
who
replied.
“King
Stannis.
You
forget
yourself,
Maester.”

“He
is
old,
his
mind
wanders,”
the
king
told
her
gruffly.
“What
is
it,
Cressen?
Speak
your
mind.”

“As
you
intend
to
sail,
it
is
vital
that
you
make
common
cause
with
Lord
Stark
and
Lady
Arryn…”

“I
make
common
cause
with
no
one,”
Stannis
Baratheon
said.

“No
more
than
light
makes
common
cause
with
darkness.”
Lady
Selyse
took
his
hand.

Stannis
nodded.
“The
Starks
seek
to
steal
half
my
kingdom,
even
as
the
Lannisters
have
stolen
my
throne
and
my
own
sweet
brother
the
swords
and
service
and
strongholds
that
are
mine
by
rights.
They
are
all
usurpers,
and
they
are
all
my
enemies.”

I
have
lost
him,
Cressen
thought,
despairing.
If
only
he
could
somehow
approach
Melisandre
unseen…
he
needed
but
an
instant’s
access
to
her
cup.
“You
are
the
rightful
heir
to
your
brother
Robert,
the
true
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,”
he
said
desperately,
“but
even
so,
you
cannot
hope
to
triumph
without
allies.”

“He
has
an
ally,”
Lady
Selyse
said.
“R’hllor,
the
Lord
of
Light,
the
Heart
of
Fire,
the
God
of
Flame
and
Shadow.”

“Gods
make
uncertain
allies
at
best,”
the
old
man
insisted,
“and
that
one
has
no
power
here.”

“You
think
not?”
The
ruby
at
Melisandre’s
throat
caught
the
light
as
she
turned
her
head,
and
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
glow
bright
as
the
comet.
“If
you
will
speak
such
folly,
Maester,
you
ought
to
wear
your
crown
again.”

“Yes,”
Lady
Selyse
agreed.
“Patches’s
helm.
It
suits
you
well,
old
man.
Put
it
on
again,
I
command
you.”

“Under
the
sea,
no
one
wears
hats,”
Patchface
said.
“I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

Lord
Stannis’s
eyes
were
shadowed
beneath
his
heavy
brow,
his
mouth
tight
as
his
jaw
worked
silently.
He
always
ground
his
teeth
when
he
was
angry.
“Fool,”
he
growled
at
last,
“my
lady
wife
commands.
Give
Cressen
your
helm.”

No,
the
old
maester
thought,
this
is
not
you,
not
your
way,
you
were
always
just,
always
hard
yet
never
cruel,
never,
you
did
not
understand
mockery,
no
more
than
you
understood
laughter.

Patchface
danced
closer,
his
cowbells
ringing,
clang-a-lang,
ding-ding,
clink-clank-clink-clank.
The
maester
sat
silent
while
the
fool
set
the
antlered
bucket
on
his
brow.
Cressen
bowed
his
head
beneath
the
weight.
His
bells
clanged.
“Perhaps
he
ought
sing
his
counsel
henceforth,”
Lady
Selyse
said.

“You
go
too
far,
woman,”
Lord
Stannis
said.
“He
is
an
old
man,
and
he’s
served
me
well.”

And
I
will
serve
you
to
the
last,
my
sweet
lord,
my
poor
lonely
son,
Cressen
thought,
for
suddenly
he
saw
the
way.
Ser
Davos’s
cup
was
before
him,
still
half-full
of
sour
red.
He
found
a
hard
flake
of
crystal
in
his
sleeve,
held
it
tight
between
thumb
and
forefinger
as
he
reached
for
the
cup.
Smooth
motions,
deft,
I
must
not
fumble
now,
he
prayed,
and
the
gods
were
kind.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye,
his
fingers
were
empty.
His
hands
had
not
been
so
steady
for
years,
nor
half
so
fluid.
Davos
saw,
but
no
one
else,
he
was
certain.
Cup
in
hand,
he
rose
to
his
feet.
“Mayhaps
I
have
been
a
fool.
Lady
Melisandre,
will
you
share
a
cup
of
wine
with
me?
A
cup
in
honor
of
your
god,
your
Lord
of
Light?
A
cup
to
toast
his
power?
“

The
red
woman
studied
him.
“If
you
wish.”

He
could
feel
them
all
watching
him.
Davos
clutched
at
him
as
he
left
the
bench,
catching
his
sleeve
with
the
fingers
that
Lord
Stannis
had
shortened.
“What
are
you
doing?”
he
whispered.

“A
thing
that
must
be
done,”
Maester
Cressen
answered,
“for
the
sake
of
the
realm,
and
the
soul
of
my
lord.”
He
shook
off
Davos’s
hand,
spilling
a
drop
of
wine
on
the
rushes.

She
met
him
beneath
the
high
table
with
every
man’s
eyes
upon
them.
But
Cressen
saw
only
her.
Red
silk,
red
eyes,
the
ruby
red
at
her
throat,
red
lips
curled
in
a
faint
smile
as
she
put
her
hand
atop
his
own,
around
the
cup.
Her
skin
felt
hot,
feverish.
“It
is
not
too
late
to
spill
the
wine,
Maester.”

“No,”
he
whispered
hoarsely.
“No.”

“As
you
will.”
Melisandre
of
Asshai
took
the
cup
from
his
hands
and
drank
long
and
deep.
There
was
only
half
a
swallow
of
wine
remaining
when
she
offered
it
back
to
him.
“And
now
you.”

His
hands
were
shaking,
but
he
made
himself
be
strong.
A
maester
of
the
Citadel
must
not
be
afraid.
The
wine
was
sour
on
his
tongue.
He
let
the
empty
cup
drop
from
his
fingers
to
shatter
on
the
floor.
“He
does
have
power
here,
my
lord,”
the
woman
said.
“And
fire
cleanses.”
At
her
throat,
the
ruby
shimmered
redly.

Cressen
tried
to
reply,
but
his
words
caught
in
his
throat.
His
cough
became
a
terrible
thin
whistle
as
he
strained
to
suck
in
air.
Iron
fingers
tightened
round
his
neck.
As
he
sank
to
his
knees,
still
he
shook
his
head,
denying
her,
denying
her
power,
denying
her
magic,
denying
her
god.
And
the
cowbells
peeled
in
his
antlers,
singing
fool,
fool,
fool
while
the
red
woman
looked
down
on
him
in
pity,
the
candle
flames
dancing
in
her
red
red
eyes.
=======
“We
should
start
back,”
Gared
urged
as
the
woods
began
to
grow
dark
around
them.
“The
wildlings
are
dead.”

“Do
the
dead
frighten
you?”
Ser
Waymar
Royce
asked
with
just
the
hint
of
a
smile.

Gared
did
not
rise
to
the
bait.
He
was
an
old
man,
past
fifty,
and
he
had
seen
the
lordlings
come
and
go.
“Dead
is
dead,”
he
said.
“We
have
no
business
with
the
dead.”

“Are
they
dead?”
Royce
asked
softly.
“What
proof
have
we?”

“Will
saw
them,”
Gared
said.
“If
he
says
they
are
dead,
that’s
proof
enough
for
me.”

Will
had
known
they
would
drag
him
into
the
quarrel
sooner
or
later.
He
wished
it
had
been
later
rather
than
sooner.
“My
mother
told
me
that
dead
men
sing
no
songs,”
he
put
in.

“My
wet
nurse
said
the
same
thing,
Will,”
Royce
replied.
“Never
believe
anything
you
hear
at
a
woman’s
tit.
There
are
things
to
be
learned
even
from
the
dead.”
His
voice
echoed,
too
loud
in
the
twilit
forest.

“We
have
a
long
ride
before
us,”
Gared
pointed
out.
“Eight
days,
maybe
nine.
And
night
is
falling.”

Ser
Waymar
Royce
glanced
at
the
sky
with
disinterest.
“It
does
that
every
day
about
this
time.
Are
you
unmanned
by
the
dark,
Gared?”

Will
could
see
the
tightness
around
Gared’s
mouth,
the
barely
suppressed
anger
in
his
eyes
under
the
thick
black
hood
of
his
cloak.
Gared
had
spent
forty
years
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
man
and
boy,
and
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
made
light
of.
Yet
it
was
more
than
that.
Under
the
wounded
pride,
Will
could
sense
something
else
in
the
older
man.
You
could
taste
it;
a
nervous
tension
that
came
perilous
close
to
fear.

Will
shared
his
unease.
He
had
been
four
years
on
the
Wall.
The
first
time
he
had
been
sent
beyond,
all
the
old
stories
had
come
rushing
back,
and
his
bowels
had
turned
to
water.
He
had
laughed
about
it
afterward.
He
was
a
veteran
of
a
hundred
rangings
by
now,
and
the
endless
dark
wilderness
that
the
southron
called
the
haunted
forest
had
no
more
terrors
for
him.

Until
tonight.
Something
was
different
tonight.
There
was
an
edge
to
this
darkness
that
made
his
hackles
rise.
Nine
days
they
had
been
riding,
north
and
northwest
and
then
north
again,
farther
and
farther
from
the
Wall,
hard
on
the
track
of
a
band
of
wildling
raiders.
Each
day
had
been
worse
than
the
day
that
had
come
before
it.
Today
was
the
worst
of
all.
A
cold
wind
was
blowing
out
of
the
north,
and
it
made
the
trees
rustle
like
living
things.
All
day,
Will
had
felt
as
though
something
were
watching
him,
something
cold
and
implacable
that
loved
him
not.
Gared
had
felt
it
too.
Will
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
ride
hellbent
for
the
safety
of
the
Wall,
but
that
was
not
a
feeling
to
share
with
your
commander.

Especially
not
a
commander
like
this
one.

Ser
Waymar
Royce
was
the
youngest
son
of
an
ancient
house
with
too
many
heirs.
He
was
a
handsome
youth
of
eighteen,
grey-eyed
and
graceful
and
slender
as
a
knife.
Mounted
on
his
huge
black
destrier,
the
knight
towered
above
Will
and
Gared
on
their
smaller
garrons.
He
wore
black
leather
boots,
black
woolen
pants,
black
moleskin
gloves,
and
a
fine
supple
coat
of
gleaming
black
ringmail
over
layers
of
black
wool
and
boiled
leather.
Ser
Waymar
had
been
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
for
less
than
half
a
year,
but
no
one
could
say
he
had
not
prepared
for
his
vocation.
At
least
insofar
as
his
wardrobe
was
concerned.

His
cloak
was
his
crowning
glory;
sable,
thick
and
black
and
soft
as
sin.
“Bet
he
killed
them
all
himself,
he
did,”
Gared
told
the
barracks
over
wine,
“twisted
their
little
heads
off,
our
mighty
warrior.”
They
had
all
shared
the
laugh.

It
is
hard
to
take
orders
from
a
man
you
laughed
at
in
your
cups,
Will
reflected
as
he
sat
shivering
atop
his
garron.
Gared
must
have
felt
the
same.

“Mormont
said
as
we
should
track
them,
and
we
did,”
Gared
said.
“They’re
dead.
They
shan’t
trouble
us
no
more.
There’s
hard
riding
before
us.
I
don’t
like
this
weather.
If
it
snows,
we
could
be
a
fortnight
getting
back,
and
snow’s
the
best
we
can
hope
for.
Ever
seen
an
ice
storm,
my
lord?”

The
lordling
seemed
not
to
hear
him.
He
studied
the
deepening
twilight
in
that
half-bored,
half-distracted
way
he
had.
Will
had
ridden
with
the
knight
long
enough
to
understand
that
it
was
best
not
to
interrupt
him
when
he
looked
like
that.
“Tell
me
again
what
you
saw,
Will.
All
the
details.
Leave
nothing
out.”

Will
had
been
a
hunter
before
he
joined
the
Night’s
Watch.
Well,
a
poacher
in
truth.
Mallister
freeriders
had
caught
him
red-handed
in
the
Mallisters’
own
woods,
skinning
one
of
the
Mallisters’
own
bucks,
and
it
had
been
a
choice
of
putting
on
the
black
or
losing
a
hand.
No
one
could
move
through
the
woods
as
silent
as
Will,
and
it
had
not
taken
the
black
brothers
long
to
discover
his
talent.

“The
camp
is
two
miles
farther
on,
over
that
ridge,
hard
beside
a
stream,”
Will
said.
“I
got
close
as
I
dared.
There’s
eight
of
them,
men
and
women
both.
No
children
I
could
see.
They
put
up
a
lean-to
against
the
rock.
The
snow’s
pretty
well
covered
it
now,
but
I
could
still
make
it
out.
No
fire
burning,
but
the
firepit
was
still
plain
as
day.
No
one
moving.
I
watched
a
long
time.
No
living
man
ever
lay
so
still.”

“Did
you
see
any
blood?”

“Well,
no,”
Will
admitted.

“Did
you
see
any
weapons?”

“Some
swords,
a
few
bows.
One
man
had
an
axe.
Heavy-looking,
double-bladed,
a
cruel
piece
of
iron.
It
was
on
the
ground
beside
him,
right
by
his
hand.”

“Did
you
make
note
of
the
position
of
the
bodies?”

Will
shrugged.
“A
couple
are
sitting
up
against
the
rock.
Most
of
them
on
the
ground.
Fallen,
like.”

“Or
sleeping,”
Royce
suggested.

“Fallen,”
Will
insisted.
“There’s
one
woman
up
an
ironwood,
half-hid
in
the
branches.
A
far-eyes.”
He
smiled
thinly.
“I
took
care
she
never
saw
me.
When
I
got
closer,
I
saw
that
she
wasn’t
moving
neither.”
Despite
himself,
he
shivered.

“You
have
a
chill?”
Royce
asked.

“Some,”
Will
muttered.
“The
wind,
m’lord.”

The
young
knight
turned
back
to
his
grizzled
man-at-arms.
Frostfallen
leaves
whispered
past
them,
and
Royce’s
destrier
moved
restlessly.
“What
do
you
think
might
have
killed
these
men,
Gared?”
Ser
Waymar
asked
casually.
He
adjusted
the
drape
of
his
long
sable
cloak.

“It
was
the
cold,”
Gared
said
with
iron
certainty.
“I
saw
men
freeze
last
winter,
and
the
one
before,
when
I
was
half
a
boy.
Everyone
talks
about
snows
forty
foot
deep,
and
how
the
ice
wind
comes
howling
out
of
the
north,
but
the
real
enemy
is
the
cold.
It
steals
up
on
you
quieter
than
Will,
and
at
first
you
shiver
and
your
teeth
chatter
and
you
stamp
your
feet
and
dream
of
mulled
wine
and
nice
hot
fires.
It
burns,
it
does.
Nothing
burns
like
the
cold.
But
only
for
a
while.
Then
it
gets
inside
you
and
starts
to
fill
you
up,
and
after
a
while
you
don’t
have
the
strength
to
fight
it.
It’s
easier
just
to
sit
down
or
go
to
sleep.
They
say
you
don’t
feel
any
pain
toward
the
end.
First
you
go
weak
and
drowsy,
and
everything
starts
to
fade,
and
then
it’s
like
sinking
into
a
sea
of
warm
milk.
Peaceful,
like.”

“Such
eloquence,
Gared,”
Ser
Waymar
observed.
“I
never
suspected
you
had
it
in
you.”

“I’ve
had
the
cold
in
me
too,
lordling.”
Gared
pulled
back
his
hood,
giving
Ser
Waymar
a
good
long
look
at
the
stumps
where
his
ears
had
been.
“Two
ears,
three
toes,
and
the
little
finger
off
my
left
hand.
I
got
off
light.
We
found
my
brother
frozen
at
his
watch,
with
a
smile
on
his
face.”

Ser
Waymar
shrugged.
“You
ought
dress
more
warmly,
Gared.”

Gared
glared
at
the
lordling,
the
scars
around
his
ear
holes
flushed
red
with
anger
where
Maester
Aemon
had
cut
the
ears
away.
“We’ll
see
how
warm
you
can
dress
when
the
winter
comes.”
He
pulled
up
his
hood
and
hunched
over
his
garron,
silent
and
sullen.

“If
Gared
said
it
was
the
cold…”
Will
began.

“Have
you
drawn
any
watches
this
past
week,
Will?”

“Yes,
m’lord.”
There
never
was
a
week
when
he
did
not
draw
a
dozen
bloody
watches.
What
was
the
man
driving
at?

“And
how
did
you
find
the
Wall?”

“Weeping,”
Will
said,
frowning.
He
saw
it
clear
enough,
now
that
the
lordling
had
pointed
it
out.
“They
couldn’t
have
froze.
Not
if
the
Wall
was
weeping.
It
wasn’t
cold
enough.”

Royce
nodded.
“Bright
lad.
We’ve
had
a
few
light
frosts
this
past
week,
and
a
quick
flurry
of
snow
now
and
then,
but
surely
no
cold
fierce
enough
to
kill
eight
grown
men.
Men
clad
in
fur
and
leather,
let
me
remind
you,
with
shelter
near
at
hand,
and
the
means
of
making
fire.”
The
knight’s
smile
was
cocksure.
“Will,
lead
us
there.
I
would
see
these
dead
men
for
myself.”

And
then
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it.
The
order
had
been
given,
and
honor
bound
them
to
obey.

Will
went
in
front,
his
shaggy
little
garron
picking
the
way
carefully
through
the
undergrowth.
A
light
snow
had
fallen
the
night
before,
and
there
were
stones
and
roots
and
hidden
sinks
lying
just
under
its
crust,
waiting
for
the
careless
and
the
unwary.
Ser
Waymar
Royce
came
next,
his
great
black
destrier
snorting
impatiently.
The
warhorse
was
the
wrong
mount
for
ranging,
but
try
and
tell
that
to
the
lordling.
Gared
brought
up
the
rear.
The
old
man-at-arms
muttered
to
himself
as
he
rode.

Twilight
deepened.
The
cloudless
sky
turned
a
deep
purple,
the
color
of
an
old
bruise,
then
faded
to
black.
The
stars
began
to
come
out.
A
half-moon
rose.
Will
was
grateful
for
the
light.

“We
can
make
a
better
pace
than
this,
surely,”
Royce
said
when
the
moon
was
full
risen.

“Not
with
this
horse,”
Will
said.
Fear
had
made
him
insolent.
“Perhaps
my
lord
would
care
to
take
the
lead?”

Ser
Waymar
Royce
did
not
deign
to
reply.

Somewhere
off
in
the
wood
a
wolf
howled.

Will
pulled
his
garron
over
beneath
an
ancient
gnarled
ironwood
and
dismounted.

“Why
are
you
stopping?”
Ser
Waymar
asked.

“Best
go
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot,
m’lord.
It’s
just
over
that
ridge.”

Royce
paused
a
moment,
staring
off
into
the
distance,
his
face
reflective.
A
cold
wind
whispered
through
the
trees.
His
great
sable
cloak
stirred
behind
like
something
half-alive.

“There’s
something
wrong
here,”
Gared
muttered.

The
young
knight
gave
him
a
disdainful
smile.
“Is
there?”

“Can’t
you
feel
it?”
Gared
asked.
“Listen
to
the
darkness.”

Will
could
feel
it.
Four
years
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
he
had
never
been
so
afraid.
What
was
it?

“Wind.
Trees
rustling.
A
wolf.
Which
sound
is
it
that
unmans
you
so,
Gared?”
When
Gared
did
not
answer,
Royce
slid
gracefully
from
his
saddle.
He
tied
the
destrier
securely
to
a
low-hanging
limb,
well
away
from
the
other
horses,
and
drew
his
longsword
from
its
sheath.
Jewels
glittered
in
its
hilt,
and
the
moonlight
ran
down
the
shining
steel.
It
was
a
splendid
weapon,
castle-forged,
and
new-made
from
the
look
of
it.
Will
doubted
it
had
ever
been
swung
in
anger.

“The
trees
press
close
here,”
Will
warned.
“That
sword
will
tangle
you
up,
m’lord.
Better
a
knife.”

“If
I
need
instruction,
I
will
ask
for
it,”
the
young
lord
said.
“Gared,
stay
here.
Guard
the
horses.”

Gared
dismounted.
“We
need
a
fire.
I’ll
see
to
it.”

“How
big
a
fool
are
you,
old
man?
If
there
are
enemies
in
this
wood,
a
fire
is
the
last
thing
we
want.”

“There’s
some
enemies
a
fire
will
keep
away,”
Gared
said.
“Bears
and
direwolves
and…
and
other
things…”

Ser
Waymar’s
mouth
became
a
hard
line.
“No
fire.”

Gared’s
hood
shadowed
his
face,
but
Will
could
see
the
hard
glitter
in
his
eyes
as
he
stared
at
the
knight.
For
a
moment
he
was
afraid
the
older
man
would
go
for
his
sword.
It
was
a
short,
ugly
thing,
its
grip
discolored
by
sweat,
its
edge
nicked
from
hard
use,
but
Will
would
not
have
given
an
iron
bob
for
the
lordling’s
life
if
Gared
pulled
it
from
its
scabbard.

Finally
Gared
looked
down.
“No
fire,”
he
muttered,
low
under
his
breath.

Royce
took
it
for
acquiescence
and
turned
away.
“Lead
on,”
he
said
to
Will.

Will
threaded
their
way
through
a
thicket,
then
started
up
the
slope
to
the
low
ridge
where
he
had
found
his
vantage
point
under
a
sentinel
tree.
Under
the
thin
crust
of
snow,
the
ground
was
damp
and
muddy,
slick
footing,
with
rocks
and
hidden
roots
to
trip
you
up.
Will
made
no
sound
as
he
climbed.
Behind
him,
he
heard
the
soft
metallic
slither
of
the
lordling’s
ringmail,
the
rustle
of
leaves,
and
muttered
curses
as
reaching
branches
grabbed
at
his
longsword
and
tugged
on
his
splendid
sable
cloak.

The
great
sentinel
was
right
there
at
the
top
of
the
ridge,
where
Will
had
known
it
would
be,
its
lowest
branches
a
bare
foot
off
the
ground.
Will
slid
in
underneath,
flat
on
his
belly
in
the
snow
and
the
mud,
and
looked
down
on
the
empty
clearing
below.

His
heart
stopped
in
his
chest.
For
a
moment
he
dared
not
breathe.
Moonlight
shone
down
on
the
clearing,
the
ashes
of
the
firepit,
the
snow-covered
lean-to,
the
great
rock,
the
little
half-frozen
stream.
Everything
was
just
as
it
had
been
a
few
hours
ago.

They
were
gone.
All
the
bodies
were
gone.

“Gods!”
he
heard
behind
him.
A
sword
slashed
at
a
branch
as
Ser
Waymar
Royce
gained
the
ridge.
He
stood
there
beside
the
sentinel,
longsword
in
hand,
his
cloak
billowing
behind
him
as
the
wind
came
up,
outlined
nobly
against
the
stars
for
all
to
see.

“Get
down!”
Will
whispered
urgently.
“Something’s
wrong.”

Royce
did
not
move.
He
looked
down
at
the
empty
clearing
and
laughed.
“Your
dead
men
seem
to
have
moved
camp,
Will.”

Will’s
voice
abandoned
him.
He
groped
for
words
that
did
not
come.
It
was
not
possible.
His
eyes
swept
back
and
forth
over
the
abandoned
campsite,
stopped
on
the
axe.
A
huge
double-bladed
battle-axe,
still
lying
where
he
had
seen
it
last,
untouched.
A
valuable
weapon…

“On
your
feet,
Will,”
Ser
Waymar
commanded.
“There’s
no
one
here.
I
won’t
have
you
hiding
under
a
bush.”

Reluctantly,
Will
obeyed.

Ser
Waymar
looked
him
over
with
open
disapproval.
“I
am
not
going
back
to
Castle
Black
a
failure
on
my
first
ranging.
We
will
find
these
men.”
He
glanced
around.
“Up
the
tree.
Be
quick
about
it.
Look
for
a
fire.”

Will
turned
away,
wordless.
There
was
no
use
to
argue.
The
wind
was
moving.
It
cut
right
through
him.
He
went
to
the
tree,
a
vaulting
grey-green
sentinel,
and
began
to
climb.
Soon
his
hands
were
sticky
with
sap,
and
he
was
lost
among
the
needles.
Fear
filled
his
gut
like
a
meal
he
could
not
digest.
He
whispered
a
prayer
to
the
nameless
gods
of
the
wood,
and
slipped
his
dirk
free
of
its
sheath.
He
put
it
between
his
teeth
to
keep
both
hands
free
for
climbing.
The
taste
of
cold
iron
in
his
mouth
gave
him
comfort.

Down
below,
the
lordling
called
out
suddenly,
“Who
goes
there?”
Will
heard
uncertainty
in
the
challenge.
He
stopped
climbing;
he
listened;
he
watched.

The
woods
gave
answer:
the
rustle
of
leaves,
the
icy
rush
of
the
stream,
a
distant
hoot
of
a
snow
owl.

The
Others
made
no
sound.

Will
saw
movement
from
the
corner
of
his
eye.
Pale
shapes
gliding
through
the
wood.
He
turned
his
head,
glimpsed
a
white
shadow
in
the
darkness.
Then
it
was
gone.
Branches
stirred
gently
in
the
wind,
scratching
at
one
another
with
wooden
fingers.
Will
opened
his
mouth
to
call
down
a
warning,
and
the
words
seemed
to
freeze
in
his
throat.
Perhaps
he
was
wrong.
Perhaps
it
had
only
been
a
bird,
a
reflection
on
the
snow,
some
trick
of
the
moonlight.
What
had
he
seen,
after
all?

“Will,
where
are
you?”
Ser
Waymar
called
up.
“Can
you
see
anything?”
He
was
turning
in
a
slow
circle,
suddenly
wary,
his
sword
in
hand.
He
must
have
felt
them,
as
Will
felt
them.
There
was
nothing
to
see.
“Answer
me!
Why
is
it
so
cold?”

It
was
cold.
Shivering,
Will
clung
more
tightly
to
his
perch.
His
face
pressed
hard
against
the
trunk
of
the
sentinel.
He
could
feel
the
sweet,
sticky
sap
on
his
cheek.

A
shadow
emerged
from
the
dark
of
the
wood.
It
stood
in
front
of
Royce.
Tall,
it
was,
and
gaunt
and
hard
as
old
bones,
with
flesh
pale
as
milk.
Its
armor
seemed
to
change
color
as
it
moved;
here
it
was
white
as
new-fallen
snow,
there
black
as
shadow,
everywhere
dappled
with
the
deep
grey-green
of
the
trees.
The
patterns
ran
like
moonlight
on
water
with
every
step
it
took.

Will
heard
the
breath
go
out
of
Ser
Waymar
Royce
in
a
long
hiss.
“Come
no
farther,”
the
lordling
warned.
His
voice
cracked
like
a
boy’s.
He
threw
the
long
sable
cloak
back
over
his
shoulders,
to
free
his
arms
for
battle,
and
took
his
sword
in
both
hands.
The
wind
had
stopped.
It
was
very
cold.

The
Other
slid
forward
on
silent
feet.
In
its
hand
was
a
longsword
like
none
that
Will
had
ever
seen.
No
human
metal
had
gone
into
the
forging
of
that
blade.
It
was
alive
with
moonlight,
translucent,
a
shard
of
crystal
so
thin
that
it
seemed
almost
to
vanish
when
seen
edge-on.
There
was
a
faint
blue
shimmer
to
the
thing,
a
ghost-light
that
played
around
its
edges,
and
somehow
Will
knew
it
was
sharper
than
any
razor.

Ser
Waymar
met
him
bravely.
“Dance
with
me
then.”
He
lifted
his
sword
high
over
his
head,
defiant.
His
hands
trembled
from
the
weight
of
it,
or
perhaps
from
the
cold.
Yet
in
that
moment,
Will
thought,
he
was
a
boy
no
longer,
but
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.

The
Other
halted.
Will
saw
its
eyes;
blue,
deeper
and
bluer
than
any
human
eyes,
a
blue
that
burned
like
ice.
They
fixed
on
the
longsword
trembling
on
high,
watched
the
moonlight
running
cold
along
the
metal.
For
a
heartbeat
he
dared
to
hope.

They
emerged
silently
from
the
shadows,
twins
to
the
first.
Three
of
them…
four…
five…
Ser
Waymar
may
have
felt
the
cold
that
came
with
them,
but
he
never
saw
them,
never
heard
them.
Will
had
to
call
out.
It
was
his
duty.
And
his
death,
if
he
did.
He
shivered,
and
hugged
the
tree,
and
kept
the
silence.

The
pale
sword
came
shivering
through
the
air.

Ser
Waymar
met
it
with
steel.
When
the
blades
met,
there
was
no
ring
of
metal
on
metal;
only
a
high,
thin
sound
at
the
edge
of
hearing,
like
an
animal
screaming
in
pain.
Royce
checked
a
second
blow,
and
a
third,
then
fell
back
a
step.
Another
flurry
of
blows,
and
he
fell
back
again.

Behind
him,
to
right,
to
left,
all
around
him,
the
watchers
stood
patient,
faceless,
silent,
the
shifting
patterns
of
their
delicate
armor
making
them
all
but
invisible
in
the
wood.
Yet
they
made
no
move
to
interfere.

Again
and
again
the
swords
met,
until
Will
wanted
to
cover
his
ears
against
the
strange
anguished
keening
of
their
clash.
Ser
Waymar
was
panting
from
the
effort
now,
his
breath
steaming
in
the
moonlight.
His
blade
was
white
with
frost;
the
Other’s
danced
with
pale
blue
light.

Then
Royce’s
parry
came
a
beat
too
late.
The
pale
sword
bit
through
the
ringmail
beneath
his
arm.
The
young
lord
cried
out
in
pain.
Blood
welled
between
the
rings.
It
steamed
in
the
cold,
and
the
droplets
seemed
red
as
fire
where
they
touched
the
snow.
Ser
Waymar’s
fingers
brushed
his
side.
His
moleskin
glove
came
away
soaked
with
red.

The
Other
said
something
in
a
language
that
Will
did
not
know;
his
voice
was
like
the
cracking
of
ice
on
a
winter
lake,
and
the
words
were
mocking.

Ser
Waymar
Royce
found
his
fury.
“For
Robert!”
he
shouted,
and
he
came
up
snarling,
lifting
the
frost-covered
longsword
with
both
hands
and
swinging
it
around
in
a
flat
sidearm
slash
with
all
his
weight
behind
it.
The
Other’s
parry
was
almost
lazy.

When
the
blades
touched,
the
steel
shattered.

A
scream
echoed
through
the
forest
night,
and
the
longsword
shivered
into
a
hundred
brittle
pieces,
the
shards
scattering
like
a
rain
of
needles.
Royce
went
to
his
knees,
shrieking,
and
covered
his
eyes.
Blood
welled
between
his
fingers.

The
watchers
moved
forward
together,
as
if
some
signal
had
been
given.
Swords
rose
and
fell,
all
in
a
deathly
silence.
It
was
cold
butchery.
The
pale
blades
sliced
through
ringmail
as
if
it
were
silk.
Will
closed
his
eyes.
Far
beneath
him,
he
heard
their
voices
and
laughter
sharp
as
icicles.

When
he
found
the
courage
to
look
again,
a
long
time
had
passed,
and
the
ridge
below
was
empty.

He
stayed
in
the
tree,
scarce
daring
to
breathe,
while
the
moon
crept
slowly
across
the
black
sky.
Finally,
his
muscles
cramping
and
his
fingers
numb
with
cold,
he
climbed
down.

Royce’s
body
lay
facedown
in
the
snow,
one
arm
outflung.
The
thick
sable
cloak
had
been
slashed
in
a
dozen
places.
Lying
dead
like
that,
you
saw
how
young
he
was.
A
boy.

He
found
what
was
left
of
the
sword
a
few
feet
away,
the
end
splintered
and
twisted
like
a
tree
struck
by
lightning.
Will
knelt,
looked
around
warily,
and
snatched
it
up.
The
broken
sword
would
be
his
proof.
Gared
would
know
what
to
make
of
it,
and
if
not
him,
then
surely
that
old
bear
Mormont
or
Maester
Aemon.
Would
Gared
still
be
waiting
with
the
horses?
He
had
to
hurry.

Will
rose.
Ser
Waymar
Royce
stood
over
him.

His
fine
clothes
were
a
tatter,
his
face
a
ruin.
A
shard
from
his
sword
transfixed
the
blind
white
pupil
of
his
left
eye.

The
right
eye
was
open.
The
pupil
burned
blue.
It
saw.

The
broken
sword
fell
from
nerveless
fingers.
Will
closed
his
eyes
to
pray.
Long,
elegant
hands
brushed
his
cheek,
then
tightened
around
his
throat.
They
were
gloved
in
the
finest
moleskin
and
sticky
with
blood,
yet
the
touch
was
icy
cold.





BRAN

The
morning
had
dawned
clear
and
cold,
with
a
crispness
that
hinted
at
the
end
of
summer.
They
set
forth
at
daybreak
to
see
a
man
beheaded,
twenty
in
all,
and
Bran
rode
among
them,
nervous
with
excitement.
This
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
deemed
old
enough
to
go
with
his
lord
father
and
his
brothers
to
see
the
king’s
justice
done.
It
was
the
ninth
year
of
summer,
and
the
seventh
of
Bran’s
life.

The
man
had
been
taken
outside
a
small
holdfast
in
the
hills.
Robb
thought
he
was
a
wildling,
his
sword
sworn
to
Mance
Rayder,
the
King-beyond-the-Wall.
It
made
Bran’s
skin
prickle
to
think
of
it.
He
remembered
the
hearth
tales
Old
Nan
told
them.
The
wildlings
were
cruel
men,
she
said,
slavers
and
slayers
and
thieves.
They
consorted
with
giants
and
ghouls,
stole
girl
children
in
the
dead
of
night,
and
drank
blood
from
polished
horns.
And
their
women
lay
with
the
Others
in
the
Long
Night
to
sire
terrible
half-human
children.

But
the
man
they
found
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
holdfast
wall
awaiting
the
king’s
justice
was
old
and
scrawny,
not
much
taller
than
Robb.
He
had
lost
both
ears
and
a
finger
to
frostbite,
and
he
dressed
all
in
black,
the
same
as
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
except
that
his
furs
were
ragged
and
greasy.

The
breath
of
man
and
horse
mingled,
steaming,
in
the
cold
morning
air
as
his
lord
father
had
the
man
cut
down
from
the
wall
and
dragged
before
them.
Robb
and
Jon
sat
tall
and
still
on
their
horses,
with
Bran
between
them
on
his
pony,
trying
to
seem
older
than
seven,
trying
to
pretend
that
he’d
seen
all
this
before.
A
faint
wind
blew
through
the
holdfast
gate.
Over
their
heads
flapped
the
banner
of
the
Starks
of
Winterfell:
a
grey
direwolf
racing
across
an
ice-white
field.

Bran’s
father
sat
solemnly
on
his
horse,
long
brown
hair
stirring
in
the
wind.
His
closely
trimmed
beard
was
shot
with
white,
making
him
look
older
than
his
thirty-five
years.
He
had
a
grim
cast
to
his
grey
eyes
this
day,
and
he
seemed
not
at
all
the
man
who
would
sit
before
the
fire
in
the
evening
and
talk
softly
of
the
age
of
heroes
and
the
children
of
the
forest.
He
had
taken
off
Father’s
face,
Bran
thought,
and
donned
the
face
of
Lord
Stark
of
Winterfell.

There
were
questions
asked
and
answers
given
there
in
the
chill
of
morning,
but
afterward
Bran
could
not
recall
much
of
what
had
been
said.
Finally
his
lord
father
gave
a
command,
and
two
of
his
guardsmen
dragged
the
ragged
man
to
the
ironwood
stump
in
the
center
of
the
square.
They
forced
his
head
down
onto
the
hard
black
wood.
Lord
Eddard
Stark
dismounted
and
his
ward
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
forth
the
sword.
“Ice,”
that
sword
was
called.
It
was
as
wide
across
as
a
man’s
hand,
and
taller
even
than
Robb.
The
blade
was
Valyrian
steel,
spell-forged
and
dark
as
smoke.
Nothing
held
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel.

His
father
peeled
off
his
gloves
and
handed
them
to
Jory
Cassel,
the
captain
of
his
household
guard.
He
took
hold
of
Ice
with
both
hands
and
said,
“In
the
name
of
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
by
the
word
of
Eddard
of
the
House
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Warden
of
the
North,
I
do
sentence
you
to
die.”
He
lifted
the
greatsword
high
above
his
head.

Bran’s
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow
moved
closer.
“Keep
the
pony
well
in
hand,”
he
whispered.
“And
don’t
look
away.
Father
will
know
if
you
do.”

Bran
kept
his
pony
well
in
hand,
and
did
not
look
away.

His
father
took
off
the
man’s
head
with
a
single
sure
stroke.
Blood
sprayed
out
across
the
snow,
as
red
as
surnmerwine.
One
of
the
horses
reared
and
had
to
be
restrained
to
keep
from
bolting.
Bran
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
blood.
The
snows
around
the
stump
drank
it
eagerly,
reddening
as
he
watched.

The
head
bounced
off
a
thick
root
and
rolled.
It
came
up
near
Greyjoy’s
feet.
Theon
was
a
lean,
dark
youth
of
nineteen
who
found
everything
amusing.
He
laughed,
put
his
boot
on
the
head,
and
kicked
it
away.

“Ass,”
Jon
muttered,
low
enough
so
Greyjoy
did
not
hear.
He
put
a
hand
on
Bran’s
shoulder,
and
Bran
looked
over
at
his
bastard
brother.
“You
did
well,”
Jon
told
him
solemnly.
Jon
was
fourteen,
an
old
hand
at
justice.

It
seemed
colder
on
the
long
ride
back
to
Winterfell,
though
the
wind
had
died
by
then
and
the
sun
was
higher
in
the
sky.
Bran
rode
with
his
brothers,
well
ahead
of
the
main
party,
his
pony
struggling
hard
to
keep
up
with
their
horses.

“The
deserter
died
bravely,”
Robb
said.
He
was
big
and
broad
and
growing
every
day,
with
his
mother’s
coloring,
the
fair
skin,
red-brown
hair,
and
blue
eyes
of
the
Tullys
of
Riverrun.
“He
had
courage,
at
the
least.”

“No,”
Jon
Snow
said
quietly.
“It
was
not
courage.
This
one
was
dead
of
fear.
You
could
see
it
in
his
eyes,
Stark.”
Jon’s
eyes
were
a
grey
so
dark
they
seemed
almost
black,
but
there
was
little
they
did
not
see.
He
was
of
an
age
with
Robb,
but
they
did
not
look
alike.
Jon
was
slender
where
Robb
was
muscular,
dark
where
Robb
was
fair,
graceful
and
quick
where
his
half
brother
was
strong
and
fast.

Robb
was
not
impressed.
“The
Others
take
his
eyes,”
he
swore.
“He
died
well.
Race
you
to
the
bridge?”

“Done,”
Jon
said,
kicking
his
horse
forward.
Robb
cursed
and
followed,
and
they
galloped
off
down
the
trail,
Robb
laughing
and
hooting,
Jon
silent
and
intent.
The
hooves
of
their
horses
kicked
up
showers
of
snow
as
they
went.

Bran
did
not
try
to
follow.
His
pony
could
not
keep
up.
He
had
seen
the
ragged
man’s
eyes,
and
he
was
thinking
of
them
now.
After
a
while,
the
sound
of
Robb’s
laughter
receded,
and
the
woods
grew
silent
again.

So
deep
in
thought
was
he
that
he
never
heard
the
rest
of
the
party
until
his
father
moved
up
to
ride
beside
him.
“Are
you
well,
Bran?”
he
asked,
not
unkindly.

“Yes,
Father,”
Bran
told
him.
He
looked
up.
Wrapped
in
his
furs
and
leathers,
mounted
on
his
great
warhorse,
his
lord
father
loomed
over
him
like
a
giant.
“Robb
says
the
man
died
bravely,
but
Jon
says
he
was
afraid.”

“What
do
you
think?”
his
father
asked.

Bran
thought
about
it.
“Can
a
man
still
be
brave
if
he’s
afraid?”

“That
is
the
only
time
a
man
can
be
brave,”
his
father
told
him.
“Do
you
understand
why
I
did
it?”

“He
was
a
wildling,”
Bran
said.
“They
carry
off
women
and
sell
them
to
the
Others.”

His
lord
father
smiled.
“Old
Nan
has
been
telling
you
stories
again.
In
truth,
the
man
was
an
oathbreaker,
a
deserter
from
the
Night’s
Watch.
No
man
is
more
dangerous.
The
deserter
knows
his
life
is
forfeit
if
he
is
taken,
so
he
will
not
flinch
from
any
crime,
no
matter
how
vile.
But
you
mistake
me.
The
question
was
not
why
the
man
had
to
die,
but
why
I
must
do
it.”

Bran
had
no
answer
for
that.
“King
Robert
has
a
headsman,”
he
said,
uncertainly.

“He
does,”
his
father
admitted.
“As
did
the
Targaryen
kings
before
him.
Yet
our
way
is
the
older
way.
The
blood
of
the
First
Men
still
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks,
and
we
hold
to
the
belief
that
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
sword.
If
you
would
take
a
man’s
life,
you
owe
it
to
him
to
look
into
his
eyes
and
hear
his
final
words.
And
if
you
cannot
bear
to
do
that,
then
perhaps
the
man
does
not
deserve
to
die.

“One
day,
Bran,
you
will
be
Robb’s
bannerman,
holding
a
keep
of
your
own
for
your
brother
and
your
king,
and
justice
will
fall
to
you.
When
that
day
comes,
you
must
take
no
pleasure
in
the
task,
but
neither
must
you
look
away.
A
ruler
who
hides
behind
paid
executioners
soon
forgets
what
death
is.”

That
was
when
Jon
reappeared
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
before
them.
He
waved
and
shouted
down
at
them.
“Father,
Bran,
come
quickly,
see
what
Robb
has
found!”
Then
he
was
gone
again.

Jory
rode
up
beside
them.
“Trouble,
my
lord?”

“Beyond
a
doubt,”
his
lord
father
said.
“Come,
let
us
see
what
mischief
my
sons
have
rooted
out
now.”
He
sent
his
horse
into
a
trot.
Jory
and
Bran
and
the
rest
came
after.

They
found
Robb
on
the
riverbank
north
of
the
bridge,
with
Jon
still
mounted
beside
him.
The
late
summer
snows
had
been
heavy
this
moonturn.
Robb
stood
knee-deep
in
white,
his
hood
pulled
back
so
the
sun
shone
in
his
hair.
He
was
cradling
something
in
his
arm,
while
the
boys
talked
in
hushed,
excited
voices.

The
riders
picked
their
way
carefully
through
the
drifts,
groping
for
solid
footing
on
the
hidden,
uneven
ground.
Jory
Cassel
and
Theon
Greyjoy
were
the
first
to
reach
the
boys.
Greyjoy
was
laughing
and
joking
as
he
rode.
Bran
heard
the
breath
go
out
of
him.
“Gods!”
he
exclaimed,
struggling
to
keep
control
of
his
horse
as
he
reached
for
his
sword.

Jory’s
sword
was
already
out.
“Robb,
get
away
from
it!”
he
called
as
his
horse
reared
under
him.

Robb
grinned
and
looked
up
from
the
bundle
in
his
arms.
“She
can’t
hurt
you,”
he
said.
“She’s
dead,
Jory.”

Bran
was
afire
with
curiosity
by
then.
He
would
have
spurred
the
pony
faster,
but
his
father
made
them
dismount
beside
the
bridge
and
approach
on
foot.
Bran
jumped
off
and
ran.

By
then
Jon,
Jory,
and
Theon
Greyjoy
had
all
dismounted
as
well.
“What
in
the
seven
hells
is
it?”
Greyjoy
was
saying.

“A
wolf,”
Robb
told
him.

“A
freak,”
Greyjoy
said.
“Look
at
the
size
of
it.”

Bran’s
heart
was
thumping
in
his
chest
as
he
pushed
through
a
waist-high
drift
to
his
brothers’
side.

Half-buried
in
bloodstained
snow,
a
huge
dark
shape
slumped
in
death.
Ice
had
formed
in
its
shaggy
grey
fur,
and
the
faint
smell
of
corruption
clung
to
it
like
a
woman’s
perfume.
Bran
glimpsed
blind
eyes
crawling
with
maggots,
a
wide
mouth
full
of
yellowed
teeth.
But
it
was
the
size
of
it
that
made
him
gasp.
It
was
bigger
than
his
pony,
twice
the
size
of
the
largest
hound
in
his
father’s
kennel.

“It’s
no
freak,”
Jon
said
calmly.
“That’s
a
direwolf.
They
grow
larger
than
the
other
kind.”

Theon
Greyjoy
said,
“There’s
not
been
a
direwolf
sighted
south
of
the
Wall
in
two
hundred
years.”

“I
see
one
now,”
Jon
replied.

Bran
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
monster.
That
was
when
he
noticed
the
bundle
in
Robb’s
arms.
He
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
moved
closer.
The
pup
was
a
tiny
ball
of
grey-black
fur,
its
eyes
still
closed.
It
nuzzled
blindly
against
Robb’s
chest
as
he
cradled
it,
searching
for
milk
among
his
leathers,
making
a
sad
little
whimpery
sound.
Bran
reached
out
hesitantly.
“Go
on,”
Robb
told
him.
“You
can
touch
him.”

Bran
gave
the
pup
a
quick
nervous
stroke,
then
turned
as
Jon
said,
“Here
you
go.”
His
half
brother
put
a
second
pup
into
his
arms.
“There
are
five
of
them.”
Bran
sat
down
in
the
snow
and
hugged
the
wolf
pup
to
his
face.
Its
fur
was
soft
and
warm
against
his
cheek.

“Direwolves
loose
in
the
realm,
after
so
many
years,”
muttered
Hullen,
the
master
of
horse.
“I
like
it
not.”

“It
is
a
sign,”
Jory
said.

Father
frowned.
“This
is
only
a
dead
animal,
Jory,”
he
said.
Yet
he
seemed
troubled.
Snow
crunched
under
his
boots
as
he
moved
around
the
body.
“Do
we
know
what
killed
her?”

“There’s
something
in
the
throat,”
Robb
told
him,
proud
to
have
found
the
answer
before
his
father
even
asked.
“There,
just
under
the
jaw.”

His
father
knelt
and
groped
under
the
beast’s
head
with
his
hand.
He
gave
a
yank
and
held
it
up
for
all
to
see.
A
foot
of
shattered
antler,
tines
snapped
off,
all
wet
with
blood.

A
sudden
silence
descended
over
the
party.
The
men
looked
at
the
antler
uneasily,
and
no
one
dared
to
speak.
Even
Bran
could
sense
their
fear,
though
he
did
not
understand.

His
father
tossed
the
antler
to
the
side
and
cleansed
his
hands
in
the
snow.
“I’m
surprised
she
lived
long
enough
to
whelp,”
he
said.
His
voice
broke
the
spell.

“Maybe
she
didn’t,”
Jory
said.
“I’ve
heard
tales…
maybe
the
bitch
was
already
dead
when
the
pups
came.”

“Born
with
the
dead,”
another
man
put
in.
“Worse
luck.”

“No
matter,”
said
Hullen.
“They
be
dead
soon
enough
too.”

Bran
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
dismay.

“The
sooner
the
better,”
Theon
Greyjoy
agreed.
He
drew
his
sword.
“Give
the
beast
here,
Bran.”

The
little
thing
squirmed
against
him,
as
if
it
heard
and
understood.
“No!”
Bran
cried
out
fiercely.
“It’s
mine.”

“Put
away
your
sword,
Greyjoy,”
Robb
said.
For
a
moment
he
sounded
as
commanding
as
their
father,
like
the
lord
he
would
someday
be.
“We
will
keep
these
pups.”

“You
cannot
do
that,
boy,”
said
Harwin,
who
was
Hullen’s
son.

“It
be
a
mercy
to
kill
them,”
Hullen
said.

Bran
looked
to
his
lord
father
for
rescue,
but
got
only
a
frown,
a
furrowed
brow.
“Hullen
speaks
truly,
son.
Better
a
swift
death
than
a
hard
one
from
cold
and
starvation.”

“No!”
He
could
feel
tears
welling
in
his
eyes,
and
he
looked
away.
He
did
not
want
to
cry
in
front
of
his
father.

Robb
resisted
stubbornly.
“Ser
Rodrik’s
red
bitch
whelped
again
last
week,”
he
said.
“It
was
a
small
litter,
only
two
live
pups.
She’ll
have
milk
enough.”

“She’ll
rip
them
apart
when
they
try
to
nurse.”

“Lord
Stark,”
Jon
said.
It
was
strange
to
hear
him
call
Father
that,
so
formal.
Bran
looked
at
him
with
desperate
hope.
“There
are
five
pups,”
he
told
Father.
“Three
male,
two
female.”

“What
of
it,
Jon?”

“You
have
five
trueborn
children,”
Jon
said.
“Three
sons,
two
daughters.
The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
your
House.
Your
children
were
meant
to
have
these
pups,
my
lord.”

Bran
saw
his
father’s
face
change,
saw
the
other
men
exchange
glances.
He
loved
Jon
with
all
his
heart
at
that
moment.
Even
at
seven,
Bran
understood
what
his
brother
had
done.
The
count
had
come
right
only
because
Jon
had
omitted
himself.
He
had
included
the
girls,
included
even
Rickon,
the
baby,
but
not
the
bastard
who
bore
the
surname
Snow,
the
name
that
custom
decreed
be
given
to
all
those
in
the
north
unlucky
enough
to
be
born
with
no
name
of
their
own.

Their
father
understood
as
well.
“You
want
no
pup
for
yourself,
Jon?”
he
asked
softly.

“The
direwolf
graces
the
banners
of
House
Stark,”
Jon
pointed
out.
“I
am
no
Stark,
Father.”

Their
lord
father
regarded
Jon
thoughtfully.
Robb
rushed
into
the
silence
he
left.
“I
will
nurse
him
myself,
Father,”
he
promised.
“I
will
soak
a
towel
with
warm
milk,
and
give
him
suck
from
that.”

“Me
too!”
Bran
echoed.

The
lord
weighed
his
sons
long
and
carefully
with
his
eyes.
“Easy
to
say,
and
harder
to
do.
I
will
not
have
you
wasting
the
servants’
time
with
this.
If
you
want
these
pups,
you
will
feed
them
yourselves.
Is
that
understood?”

Bran
nodded
eagerly.
The
pup
squirmed
in
his
grasp,
licked
at
his
face
with
a
warm
tongue.

“You
must
train
them
as
well,”
their
father
said.
“You
must
train
them.
The
kennelmaster
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
monsters,
I
promise
you
that.
And
the
gods
help
you
if
you
neglect
them,
or
brutalize
them,
or
train
them
badly.
These
are
not
dogs
to
beg
for
treats
and
slink
off
at
a
kick.
A
direwolf
will
rip
a
man’s
arm
off
his
shoulder
as
easily
as
a
dog
will
kill
a
rat.
Are
you
sure
you
want
this?”

“Yes,
Father,”
Bran
said.

“Yes,”
Robb
agreed.

“The
pups
may
die
anyway,
despite
all
you
do.”

“They
won’t
die,”
Robb
said.
“We
won’t
let
them
die.”

“Keep
them,
then.
Jory,
Desmond,
gather
up
the
other
pups.
It’s
time
we
were
back
to
Winterfell.”

It
was
not
until
they
were
mounted
and
on
their
way
that
Bran
allowed
himself
to
taste
the
sweet
air
of
victory.
By
then,
his
pup
was
snuggled
inside
his
leathers,
warm
against
him,
safe
for
the
long
ride
home.
Bran
was
wondering
what
to
name
him.

Halfway
across
the
bridge,
Jon
pulled
up
suddenly.

“What
is
it,
Jon?”
their
lord
father
asked.

“Can’t
you
hear
it?”

Bran
could
hear
the
wind
in
the
trees,
the
clatter
of
their
hooves
on
the
ironwood
planks,
the
whimpering
of
his
hungry
pup,
but
Jon
was
listening
to
something
else.

“There,”
Jon
said.
He
swung
his
horse
around
and
galloped
back
across
the
bridge.
They
watched
him
dismount
where
the
direwolf
lay
dead
in
the
snow,
watched
him
kneel.
A
moment
later
he
was
riding
back
to
them,
smiling.

“He
must
have
crawled
away
from
the
others,”
Jon
said.

“Or
been
driven
away,”
their
father
said,
looking
at
the
sixth
pup.
His
fur
was
white,
where
the
rest
of
the
litter
was
grey.
His
eyes
were
as
red
as
the
blood
of
the
ragged
man
who
had
died
that
morning.
Bran
thought
it
curious
that
this
pup
alone
would
have
opened
his
eyes
while
the
others
were
still
blind.

“An
albino,”
Theon
Greyjoy
said
with
wry
amusement.
“This
one
will
die
even
faster
than
the
others.”

Jon
Snow
gave
his
father’s
ward
a
long,
chilling
look.
“I
think
not,
Greyjoy,”
he
said.
“This
one
belongs
to
me.”





CATELYN

Catelyn
had
never
liked
this
godswood.

She
had
been
born
a
Tully,
at
Riverrun
far
to
the
south,
on
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident.
The
godswood
there
was
a
garden,
bright
and
airy,
where
tall
redwoods
spread
dappled
shadows
across
tinkling
streams,
birds
sang
from
hidden
nests,
and
the
air
was
spicy
with
the
scent
of
flowers.

The
gods
of
Winterfell
kept
a
different
sort
of
wood.
It
was
a
dark,
primal
place,
three
acres
of
old
forest
untouched
for
ten
thousand
years
as
the
gloomy
castle
rose
around
it.
It
smelled
of
moist
earth
and
decay.
No
redwoods
grew
here.
This
was
a
wood
of
stubborn
sentinel
trees
armored
in
grey-green
needles,
of
mighty
oaks,
of
ironwoods
as
old
as
the
realm
itself.
Here
thick
black
trunks
crowded
close
together
while
twisted
branches
wove
a
dense
canopy
overhead
and
misshappen
roots
wrestled
beneath
the
soil.
This
was
a
place
of
deep
silence
and
brooding
shadows,
and
the
gods
who
lived
here
had
no
names.

But
she
knew
she
would
find
her
husband
here
tonight.
Whenever
he
took
a
man’s
life,
afterward
he
would
seek
the
quiet
of
the
godswood.

Catelyn
had
been
anointed
with
the
seven
oils
and
named
in
the
rainbow
of
light
that
filled
the
sept
of
Riverrun.
She
was
of
the
Faith,
like
her
father
and
grandfather
and
his
father
before
him.
Her
gods
had
names,
and
their
faces
were
as
familiar
as
the
faces
of
her
parents.
Worship
was
a
septon
with
a
censer,
the
smell
of
incense,
a
seven-sided
crystal
alive
with
light,
voices
raised
in
song.
The
Tullys
kept
a
godswood,
as
all
the
great
houses
did,
but
it
was
only
a
place
to
walk
or
read
or
lie
in
the
sun.
Worship
was
for
the
sept.

For
her
sake,
Ned
had
built
a
small
sept
where
she
might
sing
to
the
seven
faces
of
god,
but
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
still
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks,
and
his
own
gods
were
the
old
ones,
the
nameless,
faceless
gods
of
the
greenwood
they
shared
with
the
vanished
children
of
the
forest.

At
the
center
of
the
grove
an
ancient
weirwood
brooded
over
a
small
pool
where
the
waters
were
black
and
cold.
“The
heart
tree,”
Ned
called
it.
The
weirwood’s
bark
was
white
as
bone,
its
leaves
dark
red,
like
a
thousand
bloodstained
hands.
A
face
had
been
carved
in
the
trunk
of
the
great
tree,
its
features
long
and
melancholy,
the
deep-cut
eyes
red
with
dried
sap
and
strangely
watchful.
They
were
old,
those
eyes;
older
than
Winterfell
itself.
They
had
seen
Brandon
the
Builder
set
the
first
stone,
if
the
tales
were
true;
they
had
watched
the
castle’s
granite
walls
rise
around
them.
It
was
said
that
the
children
of
the
forest
had
carved
the
faces
in
the
trees
during
the
dawn
centuries
before
the
coming
of
the
First
Men
across
the
narrow
sea.

In
the
south
the
last
weirwoods
had
been
cut
down
or
burned
out
a
thousand
years
ago,
except
on
the
Isle
of
Faces
where
the
green
men
kept
their
silent
watch.
Up
here
it
was
different.
Here
every
castle
had
its
godswood,
and
every
godswood
had
its
heart
tree,
and
every
heart
tree
its
face.

Catelyn
found
her
husband
beneath
the
weirwood,
seated
on
a
moss-covered
stone.
The
greatsword
Ice
was
across
his
lap,
and
he
was
cleaning
the
blade
in
those
waters
black
as
night.
A
thousand
years
of
humus
lay
thick
upon
the
godswood
floor,
swallowing
the
sound
of
her
feet,
but
the
red
eyes
of
the
weirwood
seemed
to
follow
her
as
she
came.
“Ned,”
she
called
softly.

He
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
her.
“Catelyn,”
he
said.
His
voice
was
distant
and
formal.
“Where
are
the
children?”

He
would
always
ask
her
that.
“In
the
kitchen,
arguing
about
names
for
the
wolf
pups.”
She
spread
her
cloak
on
the
forest
floor
and
sat
beside
the
pool,
her
back
to
the
weirwood.
She
could
feel
the
eyes
watching
her,
but
she
did
her
best
to
ignore
them.
“Arya
is
already
in
love,
and
Sansa
is
charmed
and
gracious,
but
Rickon
is
not
quite
sure.”

“Is
he
afraid?”
Ned
asked.

“A
little,”
she
admitted.
“He
is
only
three.”

Ned
frowned.
“He
must
learn
to
face
his
fears.
He
will
not
be
three
forever.
And
winter
is
coming.”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
agreed.
The
words
gave
her
a
chill,
as
they
always
did.
The
Stark
words.
Every
noble
house
had
its
words.
Family
mottoes,
touchstones,
prayers
of
sorts,
they
boasted
of
honor
and
glory,
promised
loyalty
and
truth,
swore
faith
and
courage.
All
but
the
Starks.
Winter
is
coming,
said
the
Stark
words.
Not
for
the
first
time,
she
reflected
on
what
a
strange
people
these
northerners
were.

“The
man
died
well,
I’ll
give
him
that,”
Ned
said.
He
had
a
swatch
of
oiled
leather
in
one
hand.
He
ran
it
lightly
up
the
greatsword
as
he
spoke,
polishing
the
metal
to
a
dark
glow.
“I
was
glad
for
Bran’s
sake.
You
would
have
been
proud
of
Bran.”

“I
am
always
proud
of
Bran,”
Catelyn
replied,
watching
the
sword
as
he
stroked
it.
She
could
see
the
rippling
deep
within
the
steel,
where
the
metal
had
been
folded
back
on
itself
a
hundred
times
in
the
forging.
Catelyn
had
no
love
for
swords,
but
she
could
not
deny
that
Ice
had
its
own
beauty.
It
had
been
forged
in
Valyria,
before
the
Doom
had
come
to
the
old
Freehold,
when
the
ironsmiths
had
worked
their
metal
with
spells
as
well
as
hammers.
Four
hundred
years
old
it
was,
and
as
sharp
as
the
day
it
was
forged.
The
name
it
bore
was
older
still,
a
legacy
from
the
age
of
heroes,
when
the
Starks
were
Kings
in
the
North.

“He
was
the
fourth
this
year,”
Ned
said
grimly.
“The
poor
man
was
half-mad.
Something
had
put
a
fear
in
him
so
deep
that
my
words
could
not
reach
him.”
He
sighed.
“Ben
writes
that
the
strength
of
the
Night’s
Watch
is
down
below
a
thousand.
It’s
not
only
desertions.
They
are
losing
men
on
rangings
as
well.”

“Is
it
the
wildlings?”
she
asked.

“Who
else?”
Ned
lifted
Ice,
looked
down
the
cool
steel
length
of
it.
“And
it
will
only
grow
worse.
The
day
may
come
when
I
will
have
no
choice
but
to
call
the
banners
and
ride
north
to
deal
with
this
King-beyond-the-Wall
for
good
and
all.”

“Beyond
the
Wall?”
The
thought
made
Catelyn
shudder.

Ned
saw
the
dread
on
her
face.
“Mance
Rayder
is
nothing
for
us
to
fear.”

“There
are
darker
things
beyond
the
Wall.”
She
glanced
behind
her
at
the
heart
tree,
the
pale
bark
and
red
eyes,
watching,
listening,
thinking
its
long
slow
thoughts.

His
smile
was
gentle.
“You
listen
to
too
many
of
Old
Nan’s
stories.
The
Others
are
as
dead
as
the
children
of
the
forest,
gone
eight
thousand
years.
Maester
Luwin
will
tell
you
they
never
lived
at
all.
No
living
man
has
ever
seen
one.”

“Until
this
morning,
no
living
man
had
ever
seen
a
direwolf
either,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

“I
ought
to
know
better
than
to
argue
with
a
Tully,”
he
said
with
a
rueful
smile.
He
slid
Ice
back
into
its
sheath.
“You
did
not
come
here
to
tell
me
crib
tales.
I
know
how
little
you
like
this
place.
What
is
it,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
took
her
husband’s
hand.
“There
was
grievous
news
today,
my
lord.
I
did
not
wish
to
trouble
you
until
you
had
cleansed
yourself.”
There
was
no
way
to
soften
the
blow,
so
she
told
him
straight.
“I
am
so
sorry,
my
love.
Jon
Arryn
is
dead.”

His
eyes
found
hers,
and
she
could
see
how
hard
it
took
him,
as
she
had
known
it
would.
In
his
youth,
Ned
had
fostered
at
the
Eyrie,
and
the
childless
Lord
Arryn
had
become
a
second
father
to
him
and
his
fellow
ward,
Robert
Baratheon.
When
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
had
demanded
their
heads,
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
had
raised
his
moon-and-falcon
banners
in
revolt
rather
than
give
up
those
he
had
pledged
to
protect.

And
one
day
fifteen
years
ago,
this
second
father
had
become
a
brother
as
well,
as
he
and
Ned
stood
together
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun
to
wed
two
sisters,
the
daughters
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully.

“Jon…”
he
said.
“Is
this
news
certain?”

“It
was
the
king’s
seal,
and
the
letter
is
in
Robert’s
own
hand.
I
saved
it
for
you.
He
said
Lord
Arryn
was
taken
quickly.
Even
Maester
Pycelle
was
helpless,
but
he
brought
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
so
Jon
did
not
linger
long
in
pain.”

“That
is
some
small
mercy,
I
suppose,”
he
said.
She
could
see
the
grief
on
his
face,
but
even
then
he
thought
first
of
her.
“Your
sister,”
he
said.
“And
Jon’s
boy.
What
word
of
them?”

“The
message
said
only
that
they
were
well,
and
had
returned
to
the
Eyrie,”
Catelyn
said.
“I
wish
they
had
gone
to
Riverrun
instead.
The
Eyrie
is
high
and
lonely,
and
it
was
ever
her
husband’s
place,
not
hers.
Lord
Jon’s
memory
will
haunt
each
stone.
I
know
my
sister.
She
needs
the
comfort
of
family
and
friends
around
her.”

“Your
uncle
waits
in
the
Vale,
does
he
not?
Jon
named
him
Knight
of
the
Gate,
I’d
heard.”

Catelyn
nodded.
“Brynden
will
do
what
he
can
for
her,
and
for
the
boy.
That
is
some
comfort,
but
still…”

“Go
to
her,”
Ned
urged.
“Take
the
children.
Fill
her
halls
with
noise
and
shouts
and
laughter.
That
boy
of
hers
needs
other
children
about
him,
and
Lysa
should
not
be
alone
in
her
grief.”

“Would
that
I
could,”
Catelyn
said.
“The
letter
had
other
tidings.
The
king
is
riding
to
Winterfell
to
seek
you
out.”

It
took
Ned
a
moment
to
comprehend
her
words,
but
when
the
understanding
came,
the
darkness
left
his
eyes.
“Robert
is
coming
here?”
When
she
nodded,
a
smile
broke
across
his
face.

Catelyn
wished
she
could
share
his
joy.
But
she
had
heard
the
talk
in
the
yards;
a
direwolf
dead
in
the
snow,
a
broken
antler
in
its
throat.
Dread
coiled
within
her
like
a
snake,
but
she
forced
herself
to
smile
at
this
man
she
loved,
this
man
who
put
no
faith
in
signs.
“I
knew
that
would
please
you,”
she
said.
“We
should
send
word
to
your
brother
on
the
Wall.”

“Yes,
of
course,”
he
agreed.
“Ben
will
want
to
be
here.
I
shall
tell
Maester
Luwin
to
send
his
swiftest
bird.”
Ned
rose
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet.
“Damnation,
how
many
years
has
it
been?
And
he
gives
us
no
more
notice
than
this?
How
many
in
his
party,
did
the
message
say?”

“I
should
think
a
hundred
knights,
at
the
least,
with
all
their
retainers,
and
half
again
as
many
freeriders.
Cersei
and
the
children
travel
with
them.”

“Robert
will
keep
an
easy
pace
for
their
sakes,”
he
said.
“It
is
just
as
well.
That
will
give
us
more
time
to
prepare.”

“The
queen’s
brothers
are
also
in
the
party,”
she
told
him.

Ned
grimaced
at
that.
There
was
small
love
between
him
and
the
queen’s
family,
Catelyn
knew.
The
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock
had
come
late
to
Robert’s
cause,
when
victory
was
all
but
certain,
and
he
had
never
forgiven
them.
“Well,
if
the
price
for
Robert’s
company
is
an
infestation
of
Lannisters,
so
be
it.
It
sounds
as
though
Robert
is
bringing
half
his
court.”

“Where
the
king
goes,
the
realm
follows,”
she
said.

“It
will
be
good
to
see
the
children.
The
youngest
was
still
sucking
at
the
Lannister
woman’s
teat
the
last
time
I
saw
him.
He
must
be,
what,
five
by
now?”

“Prince
Tommen
is
seven,”
she
told
him.
“The
same
age
as
Bran.
Please,
Ned,
guard
your
tongue.
The
Lannister
woman
is
our
queen,
and
her
pride
is
said
to
grow
with
every
passing
year.”

Ned
squeezed
her
hand.
“There
must
be
a
feast,
of
course,
with
singers,
and
Robert
will
want
to
hunt.
I
shall
send
Jory
south
with
an
honor
guard
to
meet
them
on
the
kingsroad
and
escort
them
back.
Gods,
how
are
we
going
to
feed
them
all?
On
his
way
already,
you
said?
Damn
the
man.
Damn
his
royal
hide.”

ARYA

At
Winterfell
they
had
called
her
“Arya
Horseface”
and
she’d
thought
nothing
could
be
worse,
but
that
was
before
the
orphan
boy
Lommy
Greenhands
had
named
her
“Lumpyhead.”

Her
head
felt
lumpy
when
she
touched
it.
When
Yoren
had
dragged
her
into
that
alley
she’d
thought
he
meant
to
kill
her,
but
the
sour
old
man
had
only
held
her
tight,
sawing
through
her
mats
and
tangles
with
his
dagger.
She
remembered
how
the
breeze
sent
the
fistfuls
of
dirty
brown
hair
skittering
across
the
paving
stones,
toward
the
sept
where
her
father
had
died.
“I’m
taking
men
and
boys
from
the
city,”
Yoren
growled
as
the
sharp
steel
scraped
at
her
head.
“Now
you
hold
still,
boy.”
By
the
time
he
had
finished,
her
scalp
was
nothing
but
tufts
and
stubble.

Afterward
he
told
her
that
from
there
to
Winterfell
she’d
be
Arry
the
orphan
boy.
“Gate
shouldn’t
be
hard,
but
the
road’s
another
matter.
You
got
a
long
way
to
go
in
bad
company.
I
got
thirty
this
time,
men
and
boys
all
bound
for
the
Wall,
and
don’t
be
thinking
they’re
like
that
bastard
brother
o’
yours.”
He
shook
her.
“Lord
Eddard
gave
me
pick
o’
the
dungeons,
and
I
didn’t
find
no
little
lordlings
down
there.
This
lot,
half
o’
them
would
turn
you
over
to
the
queen
quick
as
spit
for
a
pardon
and
maybe
a
few
silvers.
The
other
half’d
do
the
same,
only
they’d
rape
you
first.
So
you
keep
to
yourself
and
make
your
water
in
the
woods,
alone.
That’ll
be
the
hardest
part,
the
pissing,
so
don’t
drink
no
more’n
you
need.”

Leaving
King’s
Landing
was
easy,
just
like
he’d
said.
The
Lannister
guardsmen
on
the
gate
were
stopping
everyone,
but
Yoren
called
one
by
name
and
their
wagons
were
waved
through.
No
one
spared
Arya
a
glance.
They
were
looking
for
a
highborn
girl,
daughter
of
the
King’s
Hand,
not
for
a
skinny
boy
with
his
hair
chopped
off.
Arya
never
looked
back.
She
wished
the
Rush
would
rise
and
wash
the
whole
city
away,
Flea
Bottom
and
the
Red
Keep
and
the
Great
Sept
and
everything,
and
everyone
too,
especially
Prince
Joffrey
and
his
mother.
But
she
knew
it
wouldn’t,
and
anyhow
Sansa
was
still
in
the
city
and
would
wash
away
too.
When
she
remembered
that,
Arya
decided
to
wish
for
Winterfell
instead.

Yoren
was
wrong
about
the
pissing,
though.
That
wasn’t
the
hardest
part
at
all;
Lommy
Greenhands
and
Hot
Pie
were
the
hardest
part.
Orphan
boys.
Yoren
had
plucked
some
from
the
streets
with
promises
of
food
for
their
bellies
and
shoes
for
their
feet.
The
rest
he’d
found
in
chains.
“The
Watch
needs
good
men,”
he
told
them
as
they
set
out,
“but
you
lot
will
have
to
do.”

Yoren
had
taken
grown
men
from
the
dungeons
as
well,
thieves
and
poachers
and
rapers
and
the
like.
The
worst
were
the
three
he’d
found
in
the
black
cells
who
must
have
scared
even
him,
because
he
kept
them
fettered
hand
and
foot
in
the
back
of
a
wagon,
and
vowed
they’d
stay
in
irons
all
the
way
to
the
Wall.
One
had
no
nose,
only
the
hole
in
his
face
where
it
had
been
cut
off,
and
the
gross
fat
bald
one
with
the
pointed
teeth
and
the
weeping
sores
on
his
cheeks
had
eyes
like
nothing
human.

They
took
five
wagons
out
of
King’s
Landing,
laden
with
supplies
for
the
Wall:
hides
and
bolts
of
cloth,
bars
of
pig
iron,
a
cage
of
ravens,
books
and
paper
and
ink,
a
bale
of
sourleaf,
jars
of
oil,
and
chests
of
medicine
and
spices.
Teams
of
plow
horses
pulled
the
wagons,
and
Yoren
had
bought
two
coursers
and
a
half-dozen
donkeys
for
the
boys.
Arya
would
have
preferred
a
real
horse,
but
the
donkey
was
better
than
riding
on
a
wagon.

The
men
paid
her
no
mind,
but
she
was
not
so
lucky
with
the
boys.
She
was
two
years
younger
than
the
youngest
orphan,
not
to
mention
smaller
and
skinnier,
and
Lommy
and
Hot
Pie
took
her
silence
to
mean
she
was
scared,
or
stupid,
or
deaf.
“Look
at
that
sword
Lumpyhead’s
got
there,”
Lommy
said
one
morning
as
they
made
their
plodding
way
past
orchards
and
wheat
fields.
He’d
been
a
dyer’s
apprentice
before
he
was
caught
stealing,
and
his
arms
were
mottled
green
to
the
elbow.
When
he
laughed
he
brayed
like
the
donkeys
they
were
riding.
“Where’s
a
gutter
rat
like
Lumpyhead
get
him
a
sword?”

Arya
chewed
her
lip
sullenly.
She
could
see
the
back
of
Yoren’s
faded
black
cloak
up
ahead
of
the
wagons,
but
she
was
determined
not
to
go
crying
to
him
for
help.

“Maybe
he’s
a
little
squire,”
Hot
Pie
put
in.
His
mother
had
been
a
baker
before
she
died,
and
he’d
pushed
her
cart
through
the
streets
all
day,
shouting
“Hot
pies!
Hot
pies!”
“Some
lordy
lord’s
little
squire
boy,
that’s
it.”

“He
ain’t
no
squire,
look
at
him.
I
bet
that’s
not
even
a
real
sword.
I
bet
it’s
just
some
play
sword
made
of
tin.”

Arya
hated
them
making
fun
of
Needle.
“It’s
castle-forged
steel,
you
stupid,”
she
snapped,
turning
in
the
saddle
to
glare
at
them,
“and
you
better
shut
your
mouth.”

The
orphan
boys
hooted.
“Where’d
you
get
a
blade
like
that,
Lumpyface?”
Hot
Pie
wanted
to
know.

“Lumpyhead,”
corrected
Lommy.
“He
prob’ly
stole
it.”

“I
did
not!”
she
shouted.
Jon
Snow
had
given
her
Needle.
Maybe
she
had
to
let
them
call
her
Lumpyhead,
but
she
wasn’t
going
to
let
them
call
Jon
a
thief.

“If
he
stole
it,
we
could
take
it
off
him,”
said
Hot
Pie.
“It’s
not
his
anyhow.
I
could
use
me
a
sword
like
that.”

Lommy
egged
him
on.
“Go
on,
take
it
off
him,
I
dare
you.”

Hot
Pie
kicked
his
donkey,
riding
closer.
“Hey,
Lumpyface,
you
gimme
that
sword.”
His
hair
was
the
color
of
straw,
his
fat
face
all
sunburnt
and
peeling.
“You
don’t
know
how
to
use
it.”

Yes
I
do,
Arya
could
have
said.
I
killed
a
boy,
a
fat
boy
like
you,
I
stabbed
him
in
the
belly
and
he
died,
and
I’ll
kill
you
too
if
you
don’t
let
me
alone.
Only
she
did
not
dare.
Yoren
didn’t
know
about
the
stableboy,
but
she
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
if
he
found
out.
Arya
was
pretty
sure
that
some
of
the
other
men
were
killers
too,
the
three
in
the
manacles
for
sure,
but
the
queen
wasn’t
looking
for
them,
so
it
wasn’t
the
same.

“Look
at
him,”
brayed
Lommy
Greenhands.
“I
bet
he’s
going
to
cry
now.
You
want
to
cry,
Lumpyhead?”

She
had
cried
in
her
sleep
the
night
before,
dreaming
of
her
father.
Come
morning,
she’d
woken
red-eyed
and
dry,
and
could
not
have
shed
another
tear
if
her
life
had
hung
on
it.

“He’s
going
to
wet
his
pants,”
Hot
Pie
suggested.

“Leave
him
be,”
said
the
boy
with
the
shaggy
black
hair
who
rode
behind
them.
Lommy
had
named
him
the
Bull,
on
account
of
this
horned
helm
he
had
that
he
polished
all
the
time
but
never
wore.
Lommy
didn’t
dare
mock
the
Bull.
He
was
older,
and
big
for
his
age,
with
a
broad
chest
and
strong-looking
arms.

“You
better
give
Hot
Pie
the
sword,
Arry,”
Lommy
said.
“Hot
Pie
wants
it
bad.
He
kicked
a
boy
to
death.
He’ll
do
the
same
to
you,
I
bet.”

“I
knocked
him
down
and
I
kicked
him
in
the
balls,
and
I
kept
kicking
him
there
until
he
was
dead,”
Hot
Pie
boasted.
“I
kicked
him
all
to
pieces.
His
balls
were
broke
open
and
bloody
and
his
cock
turned
black.
You
better
gimme
the
sword.”

Arya
slid
her
practice
sword
from
her
belt.
“You
can
have
this
one,”
she
told
Hot
Pie,
not
wanting
to
fight.

“That’s
just
some
stick.”
He
rode
nearer
and
tried
to
reach
over
for
Needle’s
hilt.

Arya
made
the
stick
whistle
as
she
laid
the
wood
across
his
donkey’s
hindquarters.
The
animal
hawed
and
bucked,
dumping
Hot
Pie
on
the
ground.
She
vaulted
off
her
own
donkey
and
poked
him
in
the
gut
as
he
tried
to
get
up
and
he
sat
back
down
with
a
grunt.
Then
she
whacked
him
across
the
face
and
his
nose
made
a
crack
like
a
branch
breaking.
Blood
dribbled
from
his
nostrils.
When
Hot
Pie
began
to
wail,
Arya
whirled
toward
Lommy
Greenhands,
who
was
sitting
on
his
donkey
openmouthed.
“You
want
some
sword
too?”
she
yelled,
but
he
didn’t.
He
raised
dyed
green
hands
in
front
of
his
face
and
squealed
at
her
to
get
away.

The
Bull
shouted,
“Behind
you,”
and
Arya
spun.
Hot
Pie
was
on
his
knees,
his
fist
closing
around
a
big
jagged
rock.
She
let
him
throw
it,
ducking
her
head
as
it
sailed
past.
Then
she
flew
at
him.
He
raised
a
hand
and
she
hit
it,
and
then
his
cheek,
and
then
his
knee.
He
grabbed
for
her,
and
she
danced
aside
and
bounced
the
wood
off
the
back
of
his
head.
He
fell
down
and
got
up
and
stumbled
after
her,
his
red
face
all
smeared
with
dirt
and
blood.
Arya
slid
into
a
water
dancer’s
stance
and
waited.
When
he
came
close
enough,
she
lunged,
right
between
his
legs,
so
hard
that
if
her
wooden
sword
had
had
a
point
it
would
have
come
out
between
his
butt
cheeks.

By
the
time
Yoren
pulled
her
off
him,
Hot
Pie
was
sprawled
out
on
the
ground
with
his
breeches
brown
and
smelly,
crying
as
Arya
whapped
him
over
and
over
and
over.
“Enough,”
the
black
brother
roared,
prying
the
stick
sword
from
her
fingers,
“you
want
to
kill
the
fool?”
When
Lommy
and
some
others
started
to
squeal,
the
old
man
turned
on
them
too.
“Shut
your
mouths,
or
I’ll
be
shutting
them
for
you.
Any
more
o’
this,
I’ll
tie
you
lot
behind
the
wagons
and
drag
you
to
the
Wall.”
He
spat.
“And
that
goes
twice
for
you,
Arry.
You
come
with
me,
boy.
Now.”

They
were
all
looking
at
her,
even
the
three
chained
and
manacled
in
the
back
of
the
wagon.
The
fat
one
snapped
his
pointy
teeth
together
and
hissed,
but
Arya
ignored
him.

The
old
man
dragged
her
well
off
the
road
into
a
tangle
of
trees,
cursing
and
muttering
all
the
while.
“If
I
had
a
thimble
o’
sense,
I
would’ve
left
you
in
King’s
Landing.
You
hear
me,
boy?”
He
always
snarled
that
word,
putting
a
bite
in
it
so
she
would
be
certain
to
hear.
“Unlace
your
breeches
and
pull
‘em
down.
Go
on,
there’s
no
one
here
to
see.
Do
it.”

Sullenly,
Arya
did
as
he
said.
“Over
there,
against
the
oak.
Yes,
like
that.”
She
wrapped
her
arms
around
the
trunk
and
pressed
her
face
to
the
rough
wood.
“You
scream
now.
You
scream
loud.”

I
won’t,
Arya
thought
stubbornly,
but
when
Yoren
laid
the
wood
against
the
back
of
her
bare
thighs,
the
shriek
burst
out
of
her
anyway.
“Think
that
hurt?”
he
said.
“Try
this
one.”
The
stick
came
whistling.
Arya
shrieked
again,
clutching
the
tree
to
keep
from
falling.
“One
more.”
She
held
on
tight,
chewing
her
lip,
flinching
when
she
heard
it
coming.
The
stroke
made
her
jump
and
howl.
I
won’t
cry,
she
thought,
I
won’t
do
that.
I’m
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
our
sigil
is
the
direwolf,
direwolves
don’t
cry.
She
could
feel
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
running
down
her
left
leg.
Her
thighs
and
cheeks
were
ablaze
with
pain.
“Might
be
I
got
your
attention
now,”
Yoren
said.
“Next
time
you
take
that
stick
to
one
of
your
brothers,
you’ll
get
twice
what
you
give,
you
hear
me?
Now
cover
yourself.”

They’re
not
my
brothers,
Arya
thought
as
she
bent
to
yank
up
her
breeches,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
say
so.
Her
hands
fumbled
with
her
belt
and
laces.

Yoren
was
looking
at
her.
“You
hurt?”

Calm
as
still
water,
she
told
herself,
the
way
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her.
“Some.”

He
spat.
“That
pie
boy’s
hurting
worse.
It
wasn’t
him
as
killed
your
father,
girl,
nor
that
thieving
Lommy
neither.
Hitting
them
won’t
bring
him
back.”

“I
know,”
Arya
muttered
sullenly.

“Here’s
something
you
don’t
know.
It
wasn’t
supposed
to
happen
like
it
did.
I
was
set
to
leave,
wagons
bought
and
loaded,
and
a
man
comes
with
a
boy
for
me,
and
a
purse
of
coin,
and
a
message,
never
mind
who
it’s
from.
Lord
Eddard’s
to
take
the
black,
he
says
to
me,
wait,
he’ll
be
going
with
you.
Why
d’you
think
I
was
there?
Only
something
went
queer.”

“Joffrey,”
Arya
breathed.
“Someone
should
kill
him!”

“Someone
will,
but
it
won’t
be
me,
nor
you
neither.”
Yoren
tossed
back
her
stick
sword.
“Got
sourleaf
back
at
the
wagons,”
he
said
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
road.
“You’ll
chew
some,
it’ll
help
with
the
sting.”

It
did
help,
some,
though
the
taste
of
it
was
foul
and
it
made
her
spit
look
like
blood.
Even
so,
she
walked
for
the
rest
of
that
day,
and
the
day
after,
and
the
day
after
that,
too
raw
to
sit
a
donkey.
Hot
Pie
was
worse
off;
Yoren
had
to
shift
some
barrels
around
so
he
could
lie
in
the
back
of
a
wagon
on
some
sacks
of
barley,
and
he
whimpered
every
time
the
wheels
hit
a
rock.
Lommy
Greenhands
wasn’t
even
hurt,
yet
he
stayed
as
far
away
from
Arya
as
he
could
get.
“Every
time
you
look
at
him,
he
twitches,”
the
Bull
told
her
as
she
walked
beside
his
donkey.
She
did
not
answer.
It
seemed
safer
not
to
talk
to
anyone.

That
night
she
lay
upon
her
thin
blanket
on
the
hard
ground,
staring
up
at
the
great
red
comet.
The
comet
was
splendid
and
scary
all
at
once.
“The
Red
Sword,”
the
Bull
named
it;
he
claimed
it
looked
like
a
sword,
the
blade
still
red-hot
from
the
forge.
When
Arya
squinted
the
right
way
she
could
see
the
sword
too,
only
it
wasn’t
a
new
sword,
it
was
Ice,
her
father’s
greatsword,
all
ripply
Valyrian
steel,
and
the
red
was
Lord
Eddard’s
blood
on
the
blade
after
Ser
Ilyn
the
King’s
Justice
had
cut
off
his
head.
Yoren
had
made
her
look
away
when
it
happened,
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
comet
looked
like
Ice
must
have,
after.

When
at
last
she
slept,
she
dreamed
of
home.
The
kingsroad
wound
its
way
past
Winterfell
on
its
way
to
the
Wall,
and
Yoren
had
promised
he’d
leave
her
there
with
no
one
any
wiser
about
who
she’d
been.
She
yearned
to
see
her
mother
again,
and
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon…
but
it
was
Jon
Snow
she
thought
of
most.
She
wished
somehow
they
could
come
to
the
Wall
before
Winterfell,
so
Jon
might
muss
up
her
hair
and
call
her
“little
sister.”
She’d
tell
him,
“I
missed
you,”
and
he’d
say
it
too
at
the
very
same
moment,
the
way
they
always
used
to
say
things
together.
She
would
have
liked
that.
She
would
have
liked
that
better
than
anything.





SANSA

The
morning
of
King
Joffrey’s
name
day
dawned
bright
and
windy,
with
the
long
tail
of
the
great
comet
visible
through
the
high
scuttling
clouds.
Sansa
was
watching
it
from
her
tower
window
when
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
arrived
to
escort
her
down
to
the
tourney
grounds.
“What
do
you
think
it
means?”
she
asked
him.

“Glory
to
your
betrothed,”
Ser
Arys
answered
at
once.
“See
how
it
flames
across
the
sky
today
on
His
Grace’s
name
day,
as
if
the
gods
themselves
had
raised
a
banner
in
his
honor.
The
smallfolk
have
named
it
King
Joffrey’s
Comet.”

Doubtless
that
was
what
they
told
Joffrey;
Sansa
was
not
so
sure.
“I’ve
heard
servants
calling
it
the
Dragon’s
Tail.”

“King
Joffrey
sits
where
Aegon
the
Dragon
once
sat,
in
the
castle
built
by
his
son,”
Ser
Arys
said.
“He
is
the
dragon’s
heir—and
crimson
is
the
color
of
House
Lannister,
another
sign.
This
comet
is
sent
to
herald
Joffrey’s
ascent
to
the
throne,
I
have
no
doubt.
It
means
that
he
will
triumph
over
his
enemies.”

Is
it
true?
she
wondered.
Would
the
gods
be
so
cruel?
Her
mother
was
one
of
Joffrey’s
enemies
now,
her
brother
Robb
another.
Her
father
had
died
by
the
king’s
command.
Must
Robb
and
her
lady
mother
die
next?
The
comet
was
red,
but
Joffrey
was
Baratheon
as
much
as
Lannister,
and
their
sigil
was
a
black
stag
on
a
golden
field.
Shouldn’t
the
gods
have
sent
Joff
a
golden
comet?

Sansa
closed
the
shutters
and
turned
sharply
away
from
the
window.
“You
look
very
lovely
today,
my
lady,”
Ser
Arys
said.

“Thank
you,
ser.”
Knowing
that
Joffrey
would
require
her
to
attend
the
tourney
in
his
honor,
Sansa
had
taken
special
care
with
her
face
and
clothes.
She
wore
a
gown
of
pale
purple
silk
and
a
moonstone
hair
net
that
had
been
a
gift
from
Joffrey.
The
gown
had
long
sleeves
to
hide
the
bruises
on
her
arms.
Those
were
Joffrey’s
gifts
as
well.
When
they
told
him
that
Robb
had
been
proclaimed
King
in
the
North,
his
rage
had
been
a
fearsome
thing,
and
he
had
sent
Ser
Boros
to
beat
her.

“Shall
we
go?”
Ser
Arys
offered
his
arm
and
she
let
him
lead
her
from
her
chamber.
If
she
must
have
one
of
the
Kingsguard
dogging
her
steps,
Sansa
preferred
that
it
be
him.
Ser
Boros
was
short-tempered,
Ser
Meryn
cold,
and
Ser
Mandon’s
strange
dead
eyes
made
her
uneasy,
while
Ser
Preston
treated
her
like
a
lackwit
child.
Arys
Oakheart
was
courteous,
and
would
talk
to
her
cordially.
Once
he
even
objected
when
Joffrey
commanded
him
to
hit
her.
He
did
hit
her
in
the
end,
but
not
hard
as
Ser
Meryn
or
Ser
Boros
might
have,
and
at
least
he
had
argued.
The
others
obeyed
without
question…
except
for
the
Hound,
but
Joff
never
asked
the
Hound
to
punish
her.
He
used
the
other
five
for
that.

Ser
Arys
had
light
brown
hair
and
a
face
that
was
not
unpleasant
to
look
upon.
Today
he
made
quite
the
dashing
figure,
with
his
white
silk
cloak
fastened
at
the
shoulder
by
a
golden
leaf,
and
a
spreading
oak
tree
worked
upon
the
breast
of
his
tunic
in
shining
gold
thread.
“Who
do
you
think
will
win
the
day’s
honors?”
Sansa
asked
as
they
descended
the
steps
arm
in
arm.

“I
will,”
Ser
Arys
answered,
smiling.
“Yet
I
fear
the
triumph
will
have
no
savor.
This
will
be
a
small
field,
and
poor.
No
more
than
two
score
will
enter
the
lists,
including
squires
and
freeriders.
There
is
small
honor
in
unhorsing
green
boys.”

The
last
tourney
had
been
different,
Sansa
reflected.
King
Robert
had
staged
it
in
her
father’s
honor.
High
lords
and
fabled
champions
had
come
from
all
over
the
realm
to
compete,
and
the
whole
city
had
turned
out
to
watch.
She
remembered
the
splendor
of
it:
the
field
of
pavilions
along
the
river
with
a
knight’s
shield
hung
before
each
door,
the
long
rows
of
silken
pennants
waving
in
the
wind,
the
gleam
of
sunlight
on
bright
steel
and
gilded
spurs.
The
days
had
rung
to
the
sounds
of
trumpets
and
pounding
hooves,
and
the
nights
had
been
full
of
feasts
and
song.
Those
had
been
the
most
magical
days
of
her
life,
but
they
seemed
a
memory
from
another
age
now.
Robert
Baratheon
was
dead,
and
her
father
as
well,
beheaded
for
a
traitor
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
Now
there
were
three
kings
in
the
land,
and
war
raged
beyond
the
Trident
while
the
city
filled
with
desperate
men.
Small
wonder
that
they
had
to
hold
Joff’s
tournament
behind
the
thick
stone
walls
of
the
Red
Keep.

“Will
the
queen
attend,
do
you
think?”
Sansa
always
felt
safer
when
Cersei
was
there
to
restrain
her
son.

“I
fear
not,
my
lady.
The
council
is
meeting,
some
urgent
business.”
Ser
Arys
dropped
his
voice.
“Lord
Tywin
has
gone
to
ground
at
Harrenhal
instead
of
bringing
his
army
to
the
city
as
the
queen
commanded.
Her
Grace
is
furious.”
He
fell
silent
as
a
column
of
Lannister
guardsmen
marched
past,
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms.
Ser
Arys
was
fond
of
gossip,
but
only
when
he
was
certain
that
no
one
was
listening.

The
carpenters
had
erected
a
gallery
and
lists
in
the
outer
bailey.
It
was
a
poor
thing
indeed,
and
the
meager
throng
that
had
gathered
to
watch
filled
but
half
the
seats.
Most
of
the
spectators
were
guardsmen
in
the
gold
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch
or
the
crimson
of
House
Lannister;
of
lords
and
ladies
there
were
but
a
paltry
few,
the
handful
that
remained
at
court.
Grey-faced
Lord
Gyles
Rosby
was
coughing
into
a
square
of
pink
silk.
Lady
Tanda
was
bracketed
by
her
daughters,
placid
dull
Lollys
and
acid-tongued
Falyse.
Ebon-skinned
Jalabhar
Xho
was
an
exile
who
had
no
other
refuge,
Lady
Ermesande
a
babe
seated
on
her
wet
nurse’s
lap.
The
talk
was
she
would
soon
be
wed
to
one
of
the
queen’s
cousins,
so
the
Lannisters
might
claim
her
lands.

The
king
was
shaded
beneath
a
crimson
canopy,
one
leg
thrown
negligently
over
the
carved
wooden
arm
of
his
chair.
Princess
Myrcella
and
Prince
Tommen
sat
behind
him.
In
the
back
of
the
royal
box,
Sandor
Clegane
stood
at
guard,
his
hands
resting
on
his
swordbelt.
The
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
was
draped
over
his
broad
shoulders
and
fastened
with
a
jeweled
brooch,
the
snowy
cloth
looking
somehow
unnatural
against
his
brown
roughspun
tunic
and
studded
leather
jerkin.
“Lady
Sansa,”
the
Hound
announced
curtly
when
he
saw
her.
His
voice
was
as
rough
as
the
sound
of
a
saw
on
wood.
The
burn
scars
on
his
face
and
throat
made
one
side
of
his
mouth
twitch
when
he
spoke.

Princess
Myrcella
nodded
a
shy
greeting
at
the
sound
of
Sansa’s
name,
but
plump
little
Prince
Tommen
jumped
up
eagerly.
“Sansa,
did
you
hear?
I’m
to
ride
in
the
tourney
today.
Mother
said
I
could.”
Tommen
was
all
of
eight.
He
reminded
her
of
her
own
little
brother,
Bran.
They
were
of
an
age.
Bran
was
back
at
Winterfell,
a
cripple,
yet
safe.

Sansa
would
have
given
anything
to
be
with
him.
“I
fear
for
the
life
of
your
foeman,”
she
told
Tommen
solemnly.

“His
foeman
will
be
stuffed
with
straw,”
Joff
said
as
he
rose.
The
king
was
clad
in
a
gilded
breastplate
with
a
roaring
lion
engraved
upon
its
chest,
as
if
he
expected
the
war
to
engulf
them
at
any
moment.
He
was
thirteen
today,
and
tall
for
his
age,
with
the
green
eyes
and
golden
hair
of
the
Lannisters.

“Your
Grace,”
she
said,
dipping
in
a
curtsy.

Ser
Arys
bowed.
“Pray
pardon
me,
Your
Grace.
I
must
equip
myself
for
the
lists.”

Joffrey
waved
a
curt
dismissal
while
he
studied
Sansa
from
head
to
heels.
“I’m
pleased
you
wore
my
stones.”

So
the
king
had
decided
to
play
the
gallant
today.
Sansa
was
relieved.
“I
thank
you
for
them…
and
for
your
tender
words.
I
pray
you
a
lucky
name
day,
Your
Grace.”

“Sit,”
Joff
commanded,
gesturing
her
to
the
empty
seat
beside
his
own.
“Have
you
heard?
The
Beggar
King
is
dead.”

“Who?”
For
a
moment
Sansa
was
afraid
he
meant
Robb.

“Viserys.
The
last
son
of
Mad
King
Aerys.
He’s
been
going
about
the
Free
Cities
since
before
I
was
born,
calling
himself
a
king.
Well,
Mother
says
the
Dothraki
finally
crowned
him.
With
molten
gold.”
He
laughed.
“That’s
funny,
don’t
you
think?
The
dragon
was
their
sigil.
It’s
almost
as
good
as
if
some
wolf
killed
your
traitor
brother.
Maybe
I’ll
feed
him
to
wolves
after
I’ve
caught
him.
Did
I
tell
you,
I
intend
to
challenge
him
to
single
combat?”

“I
should
like
to
see
that,
Your
Grace.”
More
than
you
know.
Sansa
kept
her
tone
cool
and
polite,
yet
even
so
Joffrey’s
eyes
narrowed
as
he
tried
to
decide
whether
she
was
mocking
him.
“Will
you
enter
the
lists
today?”
she
asked
quickly.

The
king
frowned.
“My
lady
mother
said
it
was
not
fitting,
since
the
tourney
is
in
my
honor.
Otherwise
I
would
have
been
champion.
Isn’t
that
so,
dog?”

The
Hound’s
mouth
twitched.
“Against
this
lot?
Why
not?”

He
had
been
the
champion
in
her
father’s
tourney,
Sansa
remembered.
“Will
you
joust
today,
my
lord?”
she
asked
him.

Clegane’s
voice
was
thick
with
contempt.
“Wouldn’t
be
worth
the
bother
of
arming
myself.
This
is
a
tournament
of
gnats.”

The
king
laughed.
“My
dog
has
a
fierce
bark.
Perhaps
I
should
command
him
to
fight
the
day’s
champion.
To
the
death.”
Joffrey
was
fond
of
making
men
fight
to
the
death.

“You’d
be
one
knight
the
poorer.”
The
Hound
had
never
taken
a
knight’s
vows.
His
brother
was
a
knight,
and
he
hated
his
brother.

A
blare
of
trumpets
sounded.
The
king
settled
back
in
his
seat
and
took
Sansa’s
hand.
Once
that
would
have
set
her
heart
to
pounding,
but
that
was
before
he
had
answered
her
plea
for
mercy
by
presenting
her
with
her
father’s
head.
His
touch
filled
her
with
revulsion
now,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
show
it.
She
made
herself
sit
very
still.

“Ser
Meryn
Trant
of
the
Kingsguard,”
a
herald
called.

Ser
Meryn
entered
from
the
west
side
of
the
yard,
clad
in
gleaming
white
plate
chased
with
gold
and
mounted
on
a
milk-white
charger
with
a
flowing
grey
mane.
His
cloak
streamed
behind
him
like
a
field
of
snow.
He
carried
a
twelve-foot
lance.

“Ser
Hobber
of
House
Redwyne,
of
the
Arbor,”
the
herald
sang.
Ser
Hobber
trotted
in
from
the
east,
riding
a
black
stallion
caparisoned
in
burgundy
and
blue.
His
lance
was
striped
in
the
same
colors,
and
his
shield
bore
the
grape
cluster
sigil
of
his
House.
The
Redwyne
twins
were
the
queen’s
unwilling
guests,
even
as
Sansa
was.
She
wondered
whose
notion
it
had
been
for
them
to
ride
in
Joffrey’s
tourney.
Not
their
own,
she
thought.

At
a
signal
from
the
master
of
revels,
the
combatants
couched
their
lances
and
put
their
spurs
to
their
mounts.
There
were
shouts
from
the
watching
guardsmen
and
the
lords
and
ladies
in
the
gallery.
The
knights
came
together
in
the
center
of
the
yard
with
a
great
shock
of
wood
and
steel.
The
white
lance
and
the
striped
one
exploded
in
splinters
within
a
second
of
each
other.
Hobber
Redwyne
reeled
at
the
impact,
yet
somehow
managed
to
keep
his
seat.
Wheeling
their
horses
about
at
the
far
end
of
the
lists,
the
knights
tossed
down
their
broken
lances
and
accepted
replacements
from
the
squires.
Ser
Horas
Redwyne,
Ser
Hobber’s
twin,
shouted
encouragement
to
his
brother.

But
on
their
second
pass
Ser
Meryn
swung
the
point
of
his
lance
to
strike
Ser
Hobber
in
the
chest,
driving
him
from
the
saddle
to
crash
resoundingly
to
the
earth.
Ser
Horas
cursed
and
ran
out
to
help
his
battered
brother
from
the
field.

“Poorly
ridden,”
declared
King
Joffrey.

“Ser
Balon
Swann,
of
Stonehelm
in
the
Red
Watch,”
came
the
herald’s
cry.
Wide
white
wings
ornamented
Ser
Balon’s
greathelm,
and
black
and
white
swans
fought
on
his
shield.
“Morros
of
House
Slynt,
heir
to
Lord
Janos
of
Harrenhal.”

“Look
at
that
upjumped
oaf,”
Joff
hooted,
loud
enough
for
half
the
yard
to
hear.
Morros,
a
mere
squire
and
a
new-made
squire
at
that,
was
having
difficulty
managing
lance
and
shield.
The
lance
was
a
knight’s
weapon,
Sansa
knew,
the
Slynts
lowborn.
Lord
Janos
had
been
no
more
than
commander
of
the
City
Watch
before
Joffrey
had
raised
him
to
Harrenhal
and
the
council.

I
hope
he
falls
and
shames
himself,
she
thought
bitterly.
I
hope
Ser
Balon
kills
him.
When
Joffrey
proclaimed
her
father’s
death,
it
had
been
Janos
Slynt
who
seized
Lord
Eddard’s
severed
head
by
the
hair
and
raised
it
on
high
for
king
and
crowd
to
behold,
while
Sansa
wept
and
screamed.

Morros
wore
a
checkered
black-and-gold
cloak
over
black
armor
inlaid
with
golden
scrollwork.
On
his
shield
was
the
bloody
spear
his
father
had
chosen
as
the
sigil
of
their
new-made
house.
But
he
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
shield
as
he
urged
his
horse
forward,
and
Ser
Balon’s
point
struck
the
blazon
square.
Morros
dropped
his
lance,
fought
for
balance,
and
lost.
One
foot
caught
in
a
stirrup
as
he
fell,
and
the
runaway
charger
dragged
the
youth
to
the
end
of
the
lists,
head
bouncing
against
the
ground.
Joff
hooted
derision.
Sansa
was
appalled,
wondering
if
the
gods
had
heard
her
vengeful
prayer.
But
when
they
disentangled
Morros
Slynt
from
his
horse,
they
found
him
bloodied
but
alive.
“Tommen,
we
picked
the
wrong
foe
for
you,”
the
king
told
his
brother.
“The
straw
knight
jousts
better
than
that
one.”

Next
came
Ser
Horas
Redwyne’s
turn.
He
fared
better
than
his
twin,
vanquishing
an
elderly
knight
whose
mount
was
bedecked
with
silver
griffins
against
a
striped
blue-and-white
field.
Splendid
as
he
looked,
the
old
man
made
a
poor
contest
of
it.
Joffrey
curled
his
lip.
“This
is
a
feeble
show.”

“I
warned
you,”
said
the
Hound.
“Gnats.”

The
king
was
growing
bored.
It
made
Sansa
anxious.
She
lowered
her
eyes
and
resolved
to
keep
quiet,
no
matter
what.
When
Joffrey
Baratheon’s
mood
darkened,
any
chance
word
might
set
off
one
of
his
rages.

“Lothor
Brune,
freerider
in
the
service
of
Lord
Baelish,”
cried
the
herald.
“Ser
Dontos
the
Red,
of
House
Hollard.
“

The
freerider,
a
small
man
in
dented
plate
without
device,
duly
appeared
at
the
west
end
of
the
yard,
but
of
his
opponent
there
was
no
sign.
Finally
a
chestnut
stallion
trotted
into
view
in
a
swirl
of
crimson
and
scarlet
silks,
but
Ser
Dontos
was
not
on
it.
The
knight
appeared
a
moment
later,
cursing
and
staggering,
clad
in
breastplate
and
plumed
helm
and
nothing
else.
His
legs
were
pale
and
skinny,
and
his
manhood
flopped
about
obscenely
as
he
chased
after
his
horse.
The
watchers
roared
and
shouted
insults.
Catching
his
horse
by
the
bridle,
Ser
Dontos
tried
to
mount,
but
the
animal
would
not
stand
still
and
the
knight
was
so
drunk
that
his
bare
foot
kept
missing
the
stirrup.

By
then
the
crowd
was
howling
with
laughter…
all
but
the
king.
Joffrey
had
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
Sansa
remembered
well,
the
same
look
he’d
had
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
the
day
he
pronounced
death
on
Lord
Eddard
Stark.
Finally
Ser
Dontos
the
Red
gave
it
up
for
a
bad
job,
sat
down
in
the
dirt,
and
removed
his
plumed
helm.
“I
lose,”
he
shouted.
“Fetch
me
some
wine.”

The
king
stood.
“A
cask
from
the
cellars!
I’ll
see
him
drowned
in
it.”

Sansa
heard
herself
gasp.
“No,
you
can’t.”

Joffrey
turned
his
head.
“What
did
you
say?”

Sansa
could
not
believe
she
had
spoken.
Was
she
mad?
To
tell
him
no
in
front
of
half
the
court?
She
hadn’t
meant
to
say
anything,
only…
Ser
Dontos
was
drunk
and
silly
and
useless,
but
he
meant
no
harm.

“Did
you
say
I
can’t?
Did
you?”

“Please,”
Sansa
said,
“I
only
meant…
it
would
be
ill
luck,
Your
Grace…
to,
to
kill
a
man
on
your
name
day.”

“You’re
lying,”
Joffrey
said.
“I
ought
to
drown
you
with
him,
if
you
care
for
him
so
much.”

“I
don’t
care
for
him,
Your
Grace.”
The
words
tumbled
out
desperately.
“Drown
him
or
have
his
head
off,
only…
kill
him
on
the
morrow,
if
you
like,
but
please…
not
today,
not
on
your
name
day.
I
couldn’t
bear
for
you
to
have
ill
luck…
terrible
luck,
even
for
kings,
the
singers
all
say
so…”

Joffrey
scowled.
He
knew
she
was
lying,
she
could
see
it.
He
would
make
her
bleed
for
this.

“The
girl
speaks
truly,”
the
Hound
rasped.
“What
a
man
sows
on
his
name
day,
he
reaps
throughout
the
year.”
His
voice
was
flat,
as
if
he
did
not
care
a
whit
whether
the
king
believed
him
or
no.
Could
it
be
true?
Sansa
had
not
known.
It
was
just
something
she’d
said,
desperate
to
avoid
punishment.

Unhappy,
Joffrey
shifted
in
his
seat
and
flicked
his
fingers
at
Ser
Dontos.
“Take
him
away.
I’ll
have
him
killed
on
the
morrow,
the
fool.”

“He
is,”
Sansa
said.
“A
fool.
You’re
so
clever,
to
see
it.
He’s
better
fitted
to
be
a
fool
than
a
knight,
isn’t
he?
You
ought
to
dress
him
in
motley
and
make
him
clown
for
you.
He
doesn’t
deserve
the
mercy
of
a
quick
death.”

The
king
studied
her
a
moment.
“Perhaps
you’re
not
so
stupid
as
Mother
says.”
He
raised
his
voice.
“Did
you
hear
my
lady,
Dontos?
From
this
day
on,
you’re
my
new
fool.
You
can
sleep
with
Moon
Boy
and
dress
in
motley.”

Ser
Dontos,
sobered
by
his
near
brush
with
death,
crawled
to
his
knees.
“Thank
you,
Your
Grace.
And
you,
my
lady.
Thank
you.”

As
a
brace
of
Lannister
guardsmen
led
him
off,
the
master
of
revels
approached
the
box.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said,
“shall
I
summon
a
new
challenger
for
Brune,
or
proceed
with
the
next
tilt?”

“Neither.
These
are
gnats,
not
knights.
I’d
have
them
all
put
to
death,
only
it’s
my
name
day.
The
tourney
is
done.
Get
them
all
out
of
my
sight.”

The
master
of
revels
bowed,
but
Prince
Tommen
was
not
so
obedient.
“I’m
supposed
to
ride
against
the
straw
man.”

“Not
today.”

“But
I
want
to
ride!”

“I
don’t
care
what
you
want.”

“Mother
said
I
could
ride.”

“She
said,”
Princess
Myrcella
agreed.

“Mother
said,”
mocked
the
king.
“Don’t
be
childish.”

“We’re
children,”
Myrcella
declared
haughtily.
“We’re
supposed
to
be
childish.”

The
Hound
laughed.
“She
has
you
there.”

Joffrey
was
beaten.
“Very
well.
Even
my
brother
couldn’t
tilt
any
worse
than
these
others.
Master,
bring
out
the
quintain,
Tommen
wants
to
be
a
gnat.”

Tommen
gave
a
shout
of
joy
and
ran
off
to
be
readied,
his
chubby
little
legs
pumping
hard.
“Luck,”
Sansa
called
to
him.

They
set
up
the
quintain
at
the
far
end
of
the
lists
while
the
prince’s
pony
was
being
saddled.
Tommen’s
opponent
was
a
child-sized
leather
warrior
stuffed
with
straw
and
mounted
on
a
pivot,
with
a
shield
in
one
hand
and
a
padded
mace
in
the
other.
Someone
had
fastened
a
pair
of
antlers
to
the
knight’s
head.
Joffrey’s
father
King
Robert
had
worn
antlers
on
his
helm,
Sansa
remembered…
but
so
did
his
uncle
Lord
Renly,
Robert’s
brother,
who
had
turned
traitor
and
crowned
himself
king.

A
pair
of
squires
buckled
the
prince
into
his
ornate
silver-and-crimson
armor.
A
tall
plume
of
red
feathers
sprouted
from
the
crest
of
his
helm,
and
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
frolicked
together
on
his
shield.
The
squires
helped
him
mount,
and
Ser
Aron
Santagar,
the
Red
Keep’s
master-at-arms,
stepped
forward
and
handed
Tommen
a
blunted
silver
longsword
with
a
leaf-shaped
blade,
crafted
to
fit
an
eight-year-old
hand.

Tommen
raised
the
blade
high.
“Casterly
Rock!”
he
shouted
in
a
high
boyish
voice
as
he
put
his
heels
into
his
pony
and
started
across
the
hard-packed
dirt
at
the
quintain.
Lady
Tanda
and
Lord
Gyles
started
a
ragged
cheer,
and
Sansa
added
her
voice
to
theirs.
The
king
brooded
in
silence.

Tommen
got
his
pony
up
to
a
brisk
trot,
waved
his
sword
vigorously,
and
struck
the
knight’s
shield
a
solid
blow
as
he
went
by.
The
quintain
spun,
the
padded
mace
flying
around
to
give
the
prince
a
mighty
whack
in
the
back
of
his
head.
Tommen
spilled
from
the
saddle,
his
new
armor
rattling
like
a
bag
of
old
pots
as
he
hit
the
ground.
His
sword
went
flying,
his
pony
cantered
away
across
the
bailey,
and
a
great
gale
of
derision
went
up.
King
Joffrey
laughed
longest
and
loudest
of
all.

“Oh,”
Princess
Myrcella
cried.
She
scrambled
out
of
the
box
and
ran
to
her
little
brother.

Sansa
found
herself
possessed
of
a
queer
giddy
courage.
“You
should
go
with
her,”
she
told
the
king.
“Your
brother
might
be
hurt.”

Joffrey
shrugged.
“What
if
he
is?”

“You
should
help
him
up
and
tell
him
how
well
he
rode.”
Sansa
could
not
seem
to
stop
herself.

“He
got
knocked
off
his
horse
and
fell
in
the
dirt,”
the
king
pointed
out.
“That’s
not
riding
well.”

“Look,”
the
Hound
interrupted.
“The
boy
has
courage.
He’s
going
to
try
again.”

They
were
helping
Prince
Tommen
mount
his
pony.
If
only
Tommen
were
the
elder
instead
of
Joffrey,
Sansa
thought.
I
wouldn’t
mind
marrying
Tommen.

The
sounds
from
the
gatehouse
took
them
by
surprise.
Chains
rattled
as
the
portcullis
was
drawn
upward,
and
the
great
gates
opened
to
the
creak
of
iron
hinges.
“Who
told
them
to
open
the
gate?”
Joff
demanded.
With
the
troubles
in
the
city,
the
gates
of
the
Red
Keep
had
been
closed
for
days.

A
column
of
riders
emerged
from
beneath
the
portcullis
with
a
clink
of
steel
and
a
clatter
of
hooves.
Clegane
stepped
close
to
the
king,
one
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
longsword.
The
visitors
were
dinted
and
haggard
and
dusty,
yet
the
standard
they
carried
was
the
lion
of
Lannister,
golden
on
its
crimson
field.
A
few
wore
the
red
cloaks
and
mail
of
Lannister
men-at-arms,
but
more
were
freeriders
and
sellswords,
armored
in
oddments
and
bristling
with
sharp
steel…
and
there
were
others,
monstrous
savages
out
of
one
of
Old
Nan’s
tales,
the
scary
ones
Bran
used
to
love.
They
were
clad
in
shabby
skins
and
boiled
leather,
with
long
hair
and
fierce
beards.
Some
wore
bloodstained
bandages
over
their
brows
or
wrapped
around
their
hands,
and
others
were
missing
eyes,
ears,
and
fingers.

In
their
midst,
riding
on
a
tall
red
horse
in
a
strange
high
saddle
that
cradled
him
back
and
front,
was
the
queen’s
dwarf
brother
Tyrion
Lannister,
the
one
they
called
the
Imp.
He
had
let
his
beard
grow
to
cover
his
pushed-in
face,
until
it
was
a
bristly
tangle
of
yellow
and
black
hair,
coarse
as
wire.
Down
his
back
flowed
a
shadowskin
cloak,
black
fur
striped
with
white.
He
held
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
carried
his
right
arm
in
a
white
silk
sling,
but
otherwise
looked
as
grotesque
as
Sansa
remembered
from
when
he
had
visited
Winterfell.
With
his
bulging
brow
and
mismatched
eyes,
he
was
still
the
ugliest
man
she
had
ever
chanced
to
look
upon.

Yet
Tommen
put
his
spurs
into
his
pony
and
galloped
headlong
across
the
yard,
shouting
with
glee.
One
of
the
savages,
a
huge
shambling
man
so
hairy
that
his
face
was
all
but
lost
beneath
his
whiskers,
scooped
the
boy
out
of
his
saddle,
armor
and
all,
and
deposited
him
on
the
ground
beside
his
uncle.
Tommen’s
breathless
laughter
echoed
off
the
walls
as
Tyrion
clapped
him
on
the
backplate,
and
Sansa
was
startled
to
see
that
the
two
were
of
a
height.
Myrcella
came
running
after
her
brother,
and
the
dwarf
picked
her
up
by
the
waist
and
spun
her
in
a
circle,
squealing.

When
he
lowered
her
back
to
the
ground,
the
little
man
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
brow
and
came
waddling
across
the
yard
toward
Joffrey.
Two
of
his
men
followed
close
behind
him;
a
black-haired
black-eyed
sellsword
who
moved
like
a
stalking
cat,
and
a
gaunt
youth
with
an
empty
socket
where
one
eye
should
have
been.
Tommen
and
Myrcella
trailed
after
them.

The
dwarf
went
to
one
knee
before
the
king.
“Your
Grace.”

“You,”
Joffrey
said.

“Me,”
the
Imp
agreed,
“although
a
more
courteous
greeting
might
be
in
order,
for
an
uncle
and
an
elder.”

“They
said
you
were
dead,”
the
Hound
said.

The
little
man
gave
the
big
one
a
look.
One
of
his
eyes
was
green,
one
was
black,
and
both
were
cool.
“I
was
speaking
to
the
king,
not
to
his
cur.”

“I’m
glad
you’re
not
dead,”
said
Princess
Myrcella.

“We
share
that
view,
sweet
child.”
Tyrion
turned
to
Sansa.
“My
lady,
I
am
sorry
for
your
losses.
Truly,
the
gods
are
cruel.”

Sansa
could
not
think
of
a
word
to
say
to
him.
How
could
he
be
sorry
for
her
losses?
Was
he
mocking
her?
It
wasn’t
the
gods
who’d
been
cruel,
it
was
Joffrey.

“I
am
sorry
for
your
loss
as
well,
Joffrey,”
the
dwarf
said.

“What
loss?”

“Your
royal
father?
A
large
fierce
man
with
a
black
beard;
you’ll
recall
him
if
you
try.
He
was
king
before
you.”

“Oh,
him.
Yes,
it
was
very
sad,
a
boar
killed
him.”

“Is
that
what
‘they’
say,
Your
Grace?”

Joffrey
frowned.
Sansa
felt
that
she
ought
to
say
something.
What
was
it
that
Septa
Mordane
used
to
tell
her?
A
lady’s
armor
is
courtesy,
that
was
it.
She
donned
her
armor
and
said,
“I’m
sorry
my
lady
mother
took
you
captive,
my
lord.”

“A
great
many
people
are
sorry
for
that,”
Tyrion
replied,
“and
before
I
am
done,
some
may
be
a
deal
sorrier…
yet
I
thank
you
for
the
sentiment.
Joffrey,
where
might
I
find
your
mother?”

“She’s
with
my
council,”
the
king
answered.
“Your
brother
Jaime
keeps
losing
battles.”
He
gave
Sansa
an
angry
look,
as
if
it
were
her
fault.
“He’s
been
taken
by
the
Starks
and
we’ve
lost
Riverrun
and
now
her
stupid
brother
is
calling
himself
a
king.”

The
dwarf
smiled
crookedly.
“All
sorts
of
people
are
calling
themselves
kings
these
days.”

Joff
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
that,
though
he
looked
suspicious
and
out
of
sorts.
“Yes.
Well.
I
am
pleased
you’re
not
dead,
Uncle.
Did
you
bring
me
a
gift
for
my
name
day?”

“I
did.
My
wits.”

“I’d
sooner
have
Robb
Stark’s
head,”
Joff
said
with
a
sly
glance
at
Sansa.
“Tommen,
Myrcella,
come.”

Sandor
Clegane
lingered
behind
a
moment.
“I’d
guard
that
tongue
of
yours,
little
man,”
he
warned,
before
he
strode
off
after
his
liege.

Sansa
was
left
with
the
dwarf
and
his
monsters.
She
tried
to
think
of
what
else
she
might
say.
“You
hurt
your
arm,”
she
managed
at
last.

“One
of
your
northmen
hit
me
with
a
morningstar
during
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork.
I
escaped
him
by
falling
off
my
horse.”
His
grin
turned
into
something
softer
as
he
studied
her
face.
“Is
it
grief
for
your
lord
father
that
makes
you
so
sad?”

“My
father
was
a
traitor,”
Sansa
said
at
once.
“And
my
brother
and
lady
mother
are
traitors
as
well.”
That
reflex
she
had
learned
quickly.
“I
am
loyal
to
my
beloved
Joffrey.”

“No
doubt.
As
loyal
as
a
deer
surrounded
by
wolves.”

“Lions,”
she
whispered,
without
thinking.
She
glanced
about
nervously,
but
there
was
no
one
close
enough
to
hear.

Lannister
reached
out
and
took
her
hand,
and
gave
it
a
squeeze.
“I
am
only
a
little
lion,
child,
and
I
vow,
I
shall
not
savage
you.”
Bowing,
he
said
“But
now
you
must
excuse
me.
I
have
urgent
business
with
queen
and
council.”

Sansa
watched
him
walk
off,
his
body
swaying
heavily
from
side
to
side
with
every
step,
like
something
from
a
grotesquerie.
He
speaks
more
gently
than
Joffrey,
she
thought,
but
the
queen
spoke
to
me
gently
too.
He’s
still
a
Lannister,
her
brother
and
Joff’s
uncle,
and
no
friend.
Once
she
had
loved
Prince
Joffrey
with
all
her
heart,
and
admired
and
trusted
his
mother,
the
queen.
They
had
repaid
that
love
and
trust
with
her
father’s
head.
Sansa
would
never
make
that
mistake
again.





TYRION

In
the
chilly
white
raiment
of
the
Kingsguard,
Ser
Mandon
Moore
looked
like
a
corpse
in
a
shroud.
“Her
Grace
left
orders,
the
council
in
session
is
not
to
be
disturbed.”

“I
would
be
only
a
small
disturbance,
ser.”
Tyrion
slid
the
parchment
from
his
sleeve.
“I
bear
a
letter
from
my
father,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
the
Hand
of
the
King.
There
is
his
seal.”

“Her
Grace
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed,”
Ser
Mandon
repeated
slowly,
as
if
Tyrion
were
a
dullard
who
had
not
heard
him
the
first
time.

Jaime
had
once
told
him
that
Moore
was
the
most
dangerous
of
the
Kingsguard—excepting
himself,
always—because
his
face
gave
no
hint
as
what
he
might
do
next.
Tyrion
would
have
welcomed
a
hint.
Bronn
and
Timett
could
likely
kill
the
knight
if
it
came
to
swords,
but
it
would
scarcely
bode
well
if
he
began
by
slaying
one
of
Joffrey’s
protectors.
Yet
if
he
let
the
man
turn
him
away,
where
was
his
authority?
He
made
himself
smile.
“Ser
Mandon,
you
have
not
met
my
companions.
This
is
Timett
son
of
Timett,
a
red
hand
of
the
Burned
Men.
And
this
is
Bronn.
Perchance
you
recall
Ser
Vardis
Egen,
who
was
captain
of
Lord
Arryn’s
household
guard?”

“I
know
the
man.”
Ser
Mandon’s
eyes
were
pale
grey,
oddly
flat
and
lifeless.

“Knew,”
Bronn
corrected
with
a
thin
smile.

Ser
Mandon
did
not
deign
to
show
that
he
had
heard
that.

“Be
that
as
it
may,”
Tyrion
said
lightly,
“I
truly
must
see
my
sister
and
present
my
letter,
ser.
If
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
open
the
door
for
us?”

The
white
knight
did
not
respond.
Tyrion
was
almost
at
the
point
of
trying
to
force
his
way
past
when
Ser
Mandon
abruptly
stood
aside.
“You
may
enter.
They
may
not.”

A
small
victory,
he
thought,
but
sweet.
He
had
passed
his
first
test.
Tyrion
Lannister
shouldered
through
the
door,
feeling
almost
tall.
Five
members
of
the
king’s
small
council
broke
off
their
discussion
suddenly.
“You,”
his
sister
Cersei
said
in
a
tone
that
was
equal
parts
disbelief
and
distaste.

“I
can
see
where
Joffrey
learned
his
courtesies.”
Tyrion
paused
to
admire
the
pair
of
Valyrian
sphinxes
that
guarded
the
door,
affecting
an
air
of
casual
confidence.
Cersei
could
smell
weakness
the
way
a
dog
smells
fear.

“What
are
you
doing
here?”
His
sister’s
lovely
green
eyes
studied
him
without
the
least
hint
of
affection.

“Delivering
a
letter
from
our
lord
father.”
He
sauntered
to
the
table
and
placed
the
tightly
rolled
parchment
between
them.

The
eunuch
Varys
took
the
letter
and
turned
it
in
his
delicate
powdered
hands.
“How
kind
of
Lord
Tywin.
And
his
scaling
wax
is
such
a
lovely
shade
of
gold.”
Varys
gave
the
seal
a
close
inspection.
“It
gives
every
appearance
of
being
genuine.”

“Of
course
it’s
genuine.”
Cersei
snatched
it
out
of
his
hands.
She
broke
the
wax
and
unrolled
the
parchment.

Tyrion
watched
her
read.
His
sister
had
taken
the
king’s
seat
for
herself—he
gathered
Joffrey
did
not
often
trouble
to
attend
council
meetings,
no
more
than
Robert
had—so
Tyrion
climbed
up
into
the
Hand’s
chair.
it
seemed
only
appropriate.

“This
is
absurd,”
the
queen
said
at
last.
“My
lord
father
has
sent
my
brother
to
sit
in
his
place
in
this
council.
He
bids
us
accept
Tyrion
as
the
Hand
of
the
King,
until
such
time
as
he
himself
can
join
us.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stroked
his
flowing
white
beard
and
nodded
ponderously.
“It
would
seem
that
a
welcome
is
in
order.”

“Indeed.”
Jowly,
balding
Janos
Slynt
looked
rather
like
a
frog,
a
smug
frog
who
had
gotten
rather
above
himself.
“We
have
sore
need
of
you,
my
lord.
Rebellion
everywhere,
this
grim
omen
in
the
sky,
rioting
in
the
city
streets…”

“And
whose
fault
is
that,
Lord
Janos?”
Cersei
lashed
out.
“Your
gold
cloaks
are
charged
with
keeping
order.
As
to
you,
Tyrion,
you
could
better
serve
us
on
the
field
of
battle.”

He
laughed.
“No,
I’m
done
with
fields
of
battle,
thank
you.
I
sit
a
chair
better
than
a
horse,
and
I’d
sooner
hold
a
wine
goblet
than
a
battle-axe.
All
that
about
the
thunder
of
the
drums,
sunlight
flashing
on
armor,
magnificent
destriers
snorting
and
prancing?
Well,
the
drums
gave
me
headaches,
the
sunlight
flashing
on
my
armor
cooked
me
up
like
a
harvest
day
goose,
and
those
magnificent
destriers
shit
everywhere.
Not
that
I
am
complaining.
Compared
to
the
hospitality
I
enjoyed
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
drums,
horseshit,
and
fly
bites
are
my
favorite
things.”

Littlefinger
laughed.
“Well
said,
Lannister.
A
man
after
my
own
heart.”

Tyrion
smiled
at
him,
remembering
a
certain
dagger
with
a
dragonbone
hilt
and
a
Valyrian
steel
blade.
We
must
have
a
talk
about
that,
and
soon.
He
wondered
if
Lord
Petyr
would
find
that
subject
amusing
as
well.
“Please,”
he
told
them,
“do
let
me
be
of
service,
in
whatever
small
way
I
can.”

Cersei
read
the
letter
again.
“How
many
men
have
you
brought
with
you?
“

“A
few
hundred.
My
own
men,
chiefly.
Father
was
loath
to
part
with
any
of
his.
He
is
fighting
a
war,
after
all.”

“What
use
will
your
few
hundred
men
be
if
Renly
marches
on
the
city,
or
Stannis
sails
from
Dragonstone?
I
ask
for
an
army
and
my
father
sends
me
a
dwarf.
The
king
names
the
Hand,
with
the
consent
of
council.
Joffrey
named
our
lord
father.”

“And
our
lord
father
named
me.”

“He
cannot
do
that.
Not
without
Joff’s
consent.”

“Lord
Tywin
is
at
Harrenhal
with
his
host,
if
you’d
care
to
take
it
up
with
him,”
Tyrion
said
politely.
“My
lords,
perchance
you
would
permit
me
a
private
word
with
my
sister?”

Varys
slithered
to
his
feet,
smiling
in
that
unctuous
way
he
had.
“How
you
must
have
yearned
for
the
sound
of
your
sweet
sister’s
voice.
My
lords,
please,
let
us
give
them
a
few
moments
together.
The
woes
of
our
troubled
realm
shall
keep.”

Janos
Slynt
rose
hesitantly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
ponderously,
yet
they
rose.
Littlefinger
was
the
last.
“Shall
I
tell
the
steward
to
prepare
chambers
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast?”

“My
thanks,
Lord
Petyr,
but
I
will
be
taking
Lord
Stark’s
former
quarters
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.”

Littlefinger
laughed.
“You’re
a
braver
man
than
me,
Lannister.
You
do
know
the
fate
of
our
last
two
Hands?”

“Two?
If
you
mean
to
frighten
me,
why
not
say
four?”

“Four?”
Littlefinger
raised
an
eyebrow.
“Did
the
Hands
before
Lord
Arryn
meet
some
dire
end
in
the
Tower?
I’m
afraid
I
was
too
young
to
pay
them
much
mind.”

“Aerys
Targaryen’s
last
Hand
was
killed
during
the
Sack
of
King’s
Landing,
though
I
doubt
he’d
had
time
to
settle
into
the
Tower.
He
was
only
Hand
for
a
fortnight.
The
one
before
him
was
burned
to
death.
And
before
them
came
two
others
who
died
landless
and
penniless
in
exile,
and
counted
themselves
lucky.
I
believe
my
lord
father
was
the
last
Hand
to
depart
King’s
Landing
with
his
name,
properties,
and
parts
all
intact.”

“Fascinating,”
said
Littlefinger.
“And
all
the
more
reason
I’d
sooner
bed
down
in
the
dungeon.”

Perhaps
you’ll
get
that
wish,
Tyrion
thought,
but
he
said,
“Courage
and
folly
are
cousins,
or
so
I’ve
heard.
Whatever
curse
may
linger
over
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
I
pray
I’m
small
enough
to
escape
its
notice.”

Janos
Slynt
laughed,
Littlefinger
smiled,
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
followed
them
both
out,
bowing
gravely.

“I
hope
Father
did
not
send
you
all
this
way
to
plague
us
with
history
lessons,”
his
sister
said
when
they
were
alone.

“How
I
have
yearned
for
the
sound
of
your
sweet
voice,”
Tyrion
sighed
to
her.

“How
I
have
yearned
to
have
that
eunuch’s
tongue
pulled
out
with
hot
pincers,”
Cersei
replied.
“Has
father
lost
his
senses?
Or
did
you
forge
this
letter?”
She
read
it
once
more,
with
mounting
annoyance.
“Why
would
he
inflict
you
on
me?
I
wanted
him
to
come
himself.”
She
crushed
Lord
Tywin’s
letter
in
her
fingers.
“I
am
Joffrey’s
regent,
and
I
sent
him
a
royal
command!”

“And
he
ignored
you,”
Tyrion
pointed
out.
“He
has
quite
a
large
army,
he
can
do
that.
Nor
is
he
the
first.
Is
he?”

Cersei’s
mouth
tightened.
He
could
see
her
color
rising.
“If
I
name
this
letter
a
forgery
and
tell
them
to
throw
you
in
a
dungeon,
no
one
will
ignore
that,
I
promise
you.”

He
was
walking
on
rotten
ice
now,
Tyrion
knew.
One
false
step
and
he
would
plunge
through.
“No
one,”
he
agreed
amiably,
“least
of
all
our
father.
The
one
with
the
army.
But
why
should
you
want
to
throw
me
into
a
dungeon,
sweet
sister,
when
I’ve
come
all
this
long
way
to
help
you?
“

“I
do
not
require
your
help.
It
was
our
father’s
presence
that
I
commanded.”

“Yes,”
he
said
quietly,
“but
it’s
Jaime
you
want.”

His
sister
fancied
herself
subtle,
but
he
had
grown
up
with
her.
He
could
read
her
face
like
one
of
his
favorite
books,
and
what
he
read
now
was
rage,
and
fear,
and
despair.
“Jaime—”

“—is
my
brother
no
less
than
yours,”
Tyrion
interrupted.
“Give
me
your
support
and
I
promise
you,
we
will
have
Jaime
freed
and
returned
to
us
unharmed.”

“How?”
Cersei
demanded.
“The
Stark
boy
and
his
mother
are
not
like
to
forget
that
we
beheaded
Lord
Eddard.”

“True,”
Tyrion
agreed,
“yet
you
still
hold
his
daughters,
don’t
you?
I
saw
the
older
girl
out
in
the
yard
with
Joffrey.”

“Sansa,”
the
queen
said.
“I’ve
given
it
out
that
I
have
the
younger
brat
as
well,
but
it’s
a
lie.
I
sent
Meryn
Trant
to
take
her
in
hand
when
Robert
died,
but
her
wretched
dancing
master
interfered
and
the
girl
fled.
No
one
has
seen
her
since.
Likely
she’s
dead.
A
great
many
people
died
that
day.”

Tyrion
had
hoped
for
both
Stark
girls,
but
he
supposed
one
would
have
to
do.
“Tell
me
about
our
friends
on
the
council.”

His
sister
glanced
at
the
door.
“What
of
them?”

“Father
seems
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
them.
When
I
left
him,
he
was
wondering
how
their
heads
might
look
on
the
wall
beside
Lord
Stark’s.”
He
leaned
forward
across
the
table.
“Are
you
certain
of
their
loyalty?
Do
you
trust
them?”

“I
trust
no
one,”
Cersei
snapped.
“I
need
them.
Does
Father
believe
they
are
playing
us
false?”

“Suspects,
rather.”

“Why?
What
does
he
know?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“He
knows
that
your
son’s
short
reign
has
been
a
long
parade
of
follies
and
disasters.
That
suggests
that
someone
is
giving
Joffrey
some
very
bad
counsel.”

Cersei
gave
him
a
searching
look.
“Joff
has
had
no
lack
of
good
counsel.
He’s
always
been
strong-willed.
Now
that
he’s
king,
he
believes
he
should
do
as
he
pleases,
not
as
he’s
bid.”

“Crowns
do
queer
things
to
the
heads
beneath
them,”
Tyrion
agreed.
“This
business
with
Eddard
Stark…
Joffrey’s
work?”

The
queen
grimaced.
“He
was
instructed
to
pardon
Stark,
to
allow
him
to
take
the
black.
The
man
would
have
been
out
of
our
way
forever,
and
we
might
have
made
peace
with
that
son
of
his,
but
Joff
took
it
upon
himself
to
give
the
mob
a
better
show.
What
was
I
to
do?
He
called
for
Lord
Eddard’s
head
in
front
of
half
the
city.
And
Janos
Slynt
and
Ser
Ilyn
went
ahead
blithely
and
shortened
the
man
without
a
word
from
me!”
Her
hand
tightened
into
a
fist.
“The
High
Septon
claims
we
profaned
Baelor’s
Sept
with
blood,
after
lying
to
him
about
our
intent.”

“It
would
seem
he
has
a
point,”
said
Tyrion.
“So
this
Lord
Slynt,
he
was
part
of
it,
was
he?
Tell
me,
whose
fine
notion
was
it
to
grant
him
Harrenhal
and
name
him
to
the
council?”

“Littlefinger
made
the
arrangements.
We
needed
Slynt’s
gold
cloaks.
Eddard
Stark
was
plotting
with
Renly
and
he’d
written
to
Lord
Stannis,
offering
him
the
throne.
We
might
have
lost
all.
Even
so,
it
was
a
close
thing.
If
Sansa
hadn’t
come
to
me
and
told
me
all
her
father’s
plans…”

Tyrion
was
surprised.
“Truly?
His
own
daughter?”
Sansa
had
always
seemed
such
a
sweet
child,
tender
and
courteous.

“The
girl
was
wet
with
love.
She
would
have
done
anything
for
Joffrey,
until
he
cut
off
her
father’s
head
and
called
it
mercy.
That
put
an
end
to
that.”

“His
Grace
has
a
unique
way
of
winning
the
hearts
of
his
subjects,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
crooked
smile.
“Was
it
Joffrey’s
wish
to
dismiss
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
from
his
Kingsguard
too?”

Cersei
sighed.
“Joff
wanted
someone
to
blame
for
Robert’s
death.
Varys
suggested
Ser
Barristan.
Why
not?
It
gave
Jaime
command
of
the
Kingsguard
and
a
seat
on
the
small
council,
and
allowed
Joff
to
throw
a
bone
to
his
dog.
He
is
very
fond
of
Sandor
Clegane.
We
were
prepared
to
offer
Selmy
some
land
and
a
towerhouse,
more
than
the
useless
old
fool
deserved.”

“I
hear
that
useless
old
fool
slew
two
of
Slynt’s
gold
cloaks
when
they
tried
to
seize
him
at
the
Mud
Gate.”

His
sister
looked
very
unhappy.
“Janos
should
have
sent
more
men.
He
is
not
as
competent
as
might
be
wished.”

“Ser
Barristan
was
the
Lord
Commander
of
Robert
Baratheon’s
Kingsguard,”
Tyrion
reminded
her
pointedly.
“He
and
Jaime
are
the
only
survivors
of
Aerys
Targaryen’s
seven.
The
smallfolk
talk
of
him
in
the
same
way
they
talk
of
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight.
What
do
you
imagine
they’ll
think
when
they
see
Barristan
the
Bold
riding
beside
Robb
Stark
or
Stannis
Baratheon?”

Cersei
glanced
away.
“I
had
not
considered
that.”

“Father
did,”
said
Tyrion.
“That
is
why
he
sent
me.
To
put
an
end
to
these
follies
and
bring
your
son
to
heel.”

“Joff
will
be
no
more
tractable
for
you
than
for
me.”

“He
might.”

“Why
should
he?”

“He
knows
you
would
never
hurt
him.”

Cersei’s
eyes
narrowed.
“If
you
believe
I’d
ever
allow
you
to
harm
my
son,
you’re
sick
with
fever.”

Tyrion
sighed.
She’d
missed
the
point,
as
she
did
so
often.
“Joffrey
is
as
safe
with
me
as
he
is
with
you,”
he
assured
her,
“but
so
long
as
the
boy
feels
threatened,
he’ll
be
more
inclined
to
listen.”
He
took
her
hand.
“I
am
your
brother,
you
know.
You
need
me,
whether
you
care
to
admit
it
or
no.
Your
son
needs
me,
if
he’s
to
have
a
hope
of
retaining
that
ugly
iron
chair.”

His
sister
seemed
shocked
that
he
would
touch
her.
“You
have
always
been
cunning.”

“In
my
own
small
way.”
He
grinned.

“It
may
be
worth
the
trying…
but
make
no
mistake,
Tyrion.
If
I
accept
you,
you
shall
be
the
King’s
Hand
in
name,
but
my
Hand
in
truth.
You
will
share
all
your
plans
and
intentions
with
me
before
you
act,
and
you
will
do
nothing
without
my
consent.
Do
you
understand?”

“Oh,
yes.”

“Do
you
agree?”

“Certainly,”
he
lied.
“I
am
yours,
sister.”
For
as
long
as
I
need
to
be.
“So,
now
that
we
are
of
one
purpose,
we
ought
have
no
more
secrets
between
us.
You
say
Joffrey
had
Lord
Eddard
killed,
Varys
dismissed
Ser
Barristan,
and
Littlefinger
gifted
us
with
Lord
Slynt.
Who
murdered
Jon
Arryn?
“

Cersei
yanked
her
hand
back.
“How
should
I
know?”

“The
grieving
widow
in
the
Eyrie
seems
to
think
it
was
me.
Where
did
she
come
by
that
notion,
I
wonder?”

“I’m
sure
I
don’t
know.
That
fool
Eddard
Stark
accused
me
of
the
same
thing.
He
hinted
that
Lord
Arryn
suspected
or…
well,
believed…”

“That
you
were
fucking
our
sweet
Jaime?”

She
slapped
him.

“Did
you
think
I
was
as
blind
as
Father?”
Tyrion
rubbed
his
cheek.
“Who
you
lie
with
is
no
matter
to
me…
although
it
doesn’t
seem
quite
just
that
you
should
open
your
legs
for
one
brother
and
not
the
other.”

She
slapped
him.

“Be
gentle,
Cersei,
I’m
only
jesting
with
you.
If
truth
be
told,
I’d
sooner
have
a
nice
whore.
I
never
understood
what
Jaime
saw
in
you,
apart
from
his
own
reflection.”

She
slapped
him.

His
cheeks
were
red
and
burning,
yet
he
smiled.
“If
you
keep
doing
that,
I
may
get
angry.”

That
stayed
her
hand.
“Why
should
I
care
if
you
do?”

“I
have
some
new
friends,”
Tyrion
confessed.
“You
won’t
like
them
at
all.
How
did
you
kill
Robert?”

“He
did
that
himself.
All
we
did
was
help.
When
Lancel
saw
that
Robert
was
going
after
boar,
he
gave
him
strongwine.
His
favorite
sour
red,
but
fortified,
three
times
as
potent
as
he
was
used
to.
The
great
stinking
fool
loved
it.
He
could
have
stopped
swilling
it
down
anytime
he
cared
to,
but
no,
he
drained
one
skin
and
told
Lancel
to
fetch
another.
The
boar
did
the
rest.
You
should
have
been
at
the
feast,
Tyrion.
There
has
never
been
a
boar
so
delicious.
They
cooked
it
with
mushrooms
and
apples,
and
it
tasted
like
triumph.”

“Truly,
sister,
you
were
born
to
be
a
widow.”
Tyrion
had
rather
liked
Robert
Baratheon,
great
blustering
oaf
that
he
was…
doubtless
in
part
because
his
sister
loathed
him
so.
“Now,
if
you
are
done
slapping
me,
I
will
be
off.”
He
twisted
his
legs
around
and
clambered
down
awkwardly
from
the
chair.

Cersei
frowned.
“I
haven’t
given
you
leave
to
depart.
I
want
to
know
how
you
intend
to
free
Jaime.”

“I’ll
tell
you
when
I
know.
Schemes
are
like
fruit,
they
require
a
certain
ripening.
Right
now,
I
have
a
mind
to
ride
through
the
streets
and
take
the
measure
of
this
city.”
Tyrion
rested
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
sphinx
beside
the
door.
“One
parting
request.
Kindly
make
certain
no
harm
comes
to
Sansa
Stark.
It
would
not
do
to
lose
both
the
daughters.”

Outside
the
council
chamber,
Tyrion
nodded
to
Ser
Mandon
and
made
his
way
down
the
long
vaulted
hall.
Bronn
fell
in
beside
him.
Of
Timett
son
of
Timett
there
was
no
sign.
“Where’s
our
red
hand?”
Tyrion
asked.

“He
felt
an
urge
to
explore.
His
kind
was
not
made
for
waiting
about
in
halls.”

“I
hope
he
doesn’t
kill
anyone
important.”
The
clansmen
Tyrion
had
brought
down
from
their
fastnesses
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
were
loyal
in
their
own
fierce
way,
but
they
were
proud
and
quarrelsome
as
well,
prone
to
answer
insults
real
or
imagined
with
steel.
“Try
to
find
him.
And
while
you
are
at
it,
see
that
the
rest
have
been
quartered
and
fed.
I
want
them
in
the
barracks
beneath
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
don’t
let
the
steward
put
the
Stone
Crows
near
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
tell
him
the
Burned
Men
must
have
a
hall
all
to
themselves.”

“Where
will
you
be?”

“I’m
riding
back
to
the
Broken
Anvil.”

Bronn
grinned
insolently.
“Need
an
escort?
The
talk
is,
the
streets
are
dangerous.”

“I’ll
call
upon
the
captain
of
my
sister’s
household
guard,
and
remind
him
that
I
am
no
less
a
Lannister
than
she
is.
He
needs
to
recall
that
his
oath
is
to
Casterly
Rock,
not
to
Cersei
or
Joffrey.”

An
hour
later,
Tyrion
rode
from
the
Red
Keep
accompanied
by
a
dozen
Lannister
guardsmen
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
halfhelms.
As
they
passed
beneath
the
portcullis,
he
noted
the
heads
mounted
atop
the
walls.
Black
with
rot
and
old
tar,
they
had
long
since
become
unrecognizable.
“Captain
Vylarr,”
he
called,
“I
want
those
taken
down
on
the
morrow.
Give
them
to
the
silent
sisters
for
cleaning.”
It
would
be
hell
to
match
them
with
the
bodies,
he
supposed,
yet
it
must
be
done.
Even
in
the
midst
of
war
certain
decencies
needed
to
be
observed.

Vylarr
grew
hesitant.
“His
Grace
has
told
us
he
wishes
the
traitors’
heads
to
remain
on
the
walls
until
he
fills
those
last
three
empty
spikes
there
on
the
end.”

“Let
me
hazard
a
wild
stab.
One
is
for
Robb
Stark,
the
others
for
Lords
Stannis
and
Renly.
Would
that
be
right?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”

“My
nephew
is
thirteen
years
old
today,
Vylarr.
Try
and
recall
that.
I’ll
have
the
heads
down
on
the
morrow,
or
one
of
those
empty
spikes
may
have
a
different
lodger.
Do
you
take
my
meaning,
Captain?”

“I’ll
see
that
they’re
taken
down
myself,
my
lord.”

“Good.”
Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
trotted
away,
leaving
the
red
cloaks
to
follow
as
best
they
could.

He
had
told
Cersei
he
intended
to
take
the
measure
of
the
city.
That
was
not
entirely
a
lie.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
pleased
by
much
of
what
he
saw.
The
streets
of
King’s
Landing
had
always
been
teeming
and
raucous
and
noisy,
but
now
they
reeked
of
danger
in
a
way
that
he
did
not
recall
from
past
visits.
A
naked
corpse
sprawled
in
the
gutter
near
the
Street
of
Looms,
being
torn
at
by
a
pack
of
feral
dogs,
yet
no
one
seemed
to
care.
Watchmen
were
much
in
evidence,
moving
in
pairs
through
the
alleys
in
their
gold
cloaks
and
shirts
of
black
ringmail,
iron
cudgels
never
far
from
their
hands.
The
markets
were
crowded
with
ragged
men
selling
their
household
goods
for
any
price
they
could
get…
and
conspicuously
empty
of
farmers
selling
food.
What
little
produce
he
did
see
was
three
times
as
costly
as
it
had
been
a
year
ago.
One
peddler
was
hawking
rats
roasted
on
a
skewer.
“Fresh
rats,”
he
cried
loudly,
“fresh
rats.”
Doubtless
fresh
rats
were
to
be
preferred
to
old
stale
rotten
rats.
The
frightening
thing
was,
the
rats
looked
more
appetizing
than
most
of
what
the
butchers
were
selling.
On
the
Street
of
Flour,
Tyrion
saw
guards
at
every
other
shop
door.
When
times
grew
lean,
even
bakers
found
sellswords
cheaper
than
bread,
he
reflected.

“There
is
no
food
coming
in,
is
there?”
he
said
to
Vylarr.

“Little
enough,”
the
captain
admitted.
“With
the
war
in
the
riverlands
and
Lord
Renly
raising
rebels
in
Highgarden,
the
roads
are
closed
to
south
and
west.”

“And
what
has
my
good
sister
done
about
this?”

“She
is
taking
steps
to
restore
the
king’s
peace,”
Vylarr
assured
him.
“Lord
Slynt
has
tripled
the
size
of
the
City
Watch,
and
the
queen
has
put
a
thousand
craftsmen
to
work
on
our
defenses.
The
stonemasons
are
strengthening
the
walls,
carpenters
are
building
scorpions
and
catapults
by
the
hundred,
fletchers
are
making
arrows,
the
smiths
are
forging
blades,
and
the
Alchemists’
Guild
has
pledged
ten
thousand
jars
of
wildfire.”

Tyrion
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
saddle.
He
was
pleased
that
Cersei
had
not
been
idle,
but
wildfire
was
treacherous
stuff,
and
ten
thousand
jars
were
enough
to
turn
all
of
King’s
Landing
into
cinders.
“Where
has
my
sister
found
the
coin
to
pay
for
all
of
this?”
It
was
no
secret
that
King
Robert
had
left
the
crown
vastly
in
debt,
and
alchemists
were
seldom
mistaken
for
altruists.

“Lord
Littlefinger
always
finds
a
way,
my
lord.
He
has
imposed
a
tax
on
those
wishing
to
enter
the
city.”

“Yes,
that
would
work,”
Tyrion
said,
thinking,
Clever.
Clever
and
cruel.
Tens
of
thousands
had
fled
the
fighting
for
the
supposed
safety
of
King’s
Landing.
He
had
seen
them
on
the
kingsroad,
troupes
of
mothers
and
children
and
anxious
fathers
who
had
gazed
on
his
horses
and
wagons
with
covetous
eyes.
Once
they
reached
the
city
they
would
doubtless
pay
over
all
they
had
to
put
those
high
comforting
walls
between
them
and
the
war…
though
they
might
think
twice
if
they
knew
about
the
wildfire.

The
inn
beneath
the
sign
of
the
broken
anvil
stood
within
sight
of
those
walls,
near
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
where
they
had
entered
that
morning.
As
they
rode
into
its
courtyard,
a
boy
ran
out
to
help
Tyrion
down
from
his
horse.
“Take
your
men
back
to
the
castle,”
he
told
Vylarr.
“I’ll
be
spending
the
night
here.”

The
captain
looked
dubious.
“Will
you
be
safe,
my
lord?”

“Well,
as
to
that,
Captain,
when
I
left
the
inn
this
morning
it
was
full
of
Black
Ears.
One
is
never
quite
safe
when
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
is
about.”
Tyrion
waddled
toward
the
door,
leaving
Vylarr
to
puzzle
at
his
meaning.

A
gust
of
merriment
greeted
him
as
he
shoved
into
the
inn’s
common
room.
He
recognized
Chella’s
throaty
chuckle
and
the
lighter
music
of
Shae’s
laughter.
The
girl
was
seated
by
the
hearth,
sipping
wine
at
a
round
wooden
table
with
three
of
the
Black
Ears
he’d
left
to
guard
her
and
a
plump
man
whose
back
was
to
him.
The
innkeeper,
he
assumed…
until
Shae
called
Tyrion
by
name
and
the
intruder
rose.
“My
good
lord,
I
am
so
pleased
to
see
you,”
he
gushed,
a
soft
eunuch’s
smile
on
his
powdered
face.

Tyrion
stumbled.
“Lord
Varys.
I
had
not
thought
to
see
you
here.”
The
Others
take
him,
how
did
he
find
them
so
quickly?

“Forgive
me
if
I
intrude,”
Varys
said.
“I
was
taken
by
a
sudden
urge
to
meet
your
young
lady.”

“Young
lady,”
Shae
repeated,
savoring
the
words.
“You’re
half
right,
m’lord.
I’m
young.”

Eighteen,
Tyrion
thought.
Eighteen,
and
a
whore,
but
quick
of
wit,
nimble
as
a
cat
between
the
sheets,
with
large
dark
eyes
and
fine
black
hair
and
a
sweet,
soft,
hungry
little
mouth…
and
mine!
Damn
you,
eunuch.
“I
fear
I’m
the
intruder,
Lord
Varys,”
he
said
with
forced
courtesy.
“When
I
came
in,
you
were
in
the
midst
of
some
merriment.”

“M’lord
Varys
complimented
Chella
on
her
ears
and
said
she
must
have
killed
many
men
to
have
such
a
fine
necklace,”
Shae
explained.
It
grated
on
him
to
hear
her
call
Varys
m’lord
in
that
tone;
that
was
what
she
called
him
in
their
pillow
play.
“And
Chella
told
him
only
cowards
kill
the
vanquished.”

“Braver
to
leave
the
man
alive,
with
a
chance
to
cleanse
his
shame
by
winning
back
his
ear,”
explained
Chella,
a
small
dark
woman
whose
grisly
neckware
was
hung
with
no
less
than
forty-six
dried,
wrinkled
ears.
Tyrion
had
counted
them
once.
“Only
so
can
you
prove
you
do
not
fear
your
enemies.”

Shae
hooted.
“And
then
m’lord
says
if
he
was
a
Black
Ear
he’d
never
sleep,
for
dreams
of
one-eared
men.”

“A
problem
I
will
never
need
face,”
Tyrion
said.
“I’m
terrified
of
my
enemies,
so
I
kill
them
all.”

Varys
giggled.
“Will
you
take
some
wine
with
us,
my
lord?”

“I’ll
take
some
wine.”
Tyrion
seated
himself
beside
Shae.
He
understood
what
was
happening
here,
if
Chella
and
the
girl
did
not.
Varys
was
delivering
a
message.
When
he
said,
I
was
taken
by
a
sudden
urge
to
meet
your
young
lady,
what
he
meant
was,
You
tried
to
hide
her,
but
I
knew
where
she
was,
and
who
she
was,
and
here
I
am.
He
wondered
who
had
betrayed
him.
The
innkeeper,
that
boy
in
the
stable,
a
guard
on
the
gate…
or
one
of
his
own?

“I
always
like
to
return
to
the
city
through
the
Gate
of
the
Gods,”
Varys
told
Shae
as
he
filled
the
wine
cups.
“The
carvings
on
the
gatehouse
are
exquisite,
they
make
me
weep
each
time
I
see
them.
The
eyes…
so
expressive,
don’t
you
think?
They
almost
seem
to
follow
you
as
you
ride
beneath
the
portcullis.”

“I
never
noticed,
m’lord,”
Shae
replied.
“I’ll
look
again
on
the
morrow,
if
it
please
you.”

Don’t
bother,
sweetling,
Tyrion
thought,
swirling
the
wine
in
the
cup.
He
cares
not
a
whit
about
carvings.
The
eyes
he
boasts
of
are
his
own.
What
he
means
is
that
he
was
watching,
that
he
knew
we
were
here
the
moment
we
passed
through
the
gates.

“Do
be
careful,
child,”
Varys
urged.
“King’s
Landing
is
not
wholly
safe
these
days.
I
know
these
streets
well,
and
yet
I
almost
feared
to
come
today,
alone
and
unarmed
as
I
was.
Lawless
men
are
everywhere
in
this
dark
time,
oh,
yes.
Men
with
cold
steel
and
colder
hearts.”
Where
I
can
come
alone
and
unarmed,
others
can
come
with
swords
in
their
fists,
he
was
saying.

Shae
only
laughed.
“If
they
try
and
bother
me,
they’ll
be
one
ear
short
when
Chella
runs
them
off.”

Varys
hooted
as
if
that
was
the
funniest
thing
he
had
ever
heard,
but
there
was
no
laughter
in
his
eyes
when
he
turned
them
on
Tyrion.
“Your
young
lady
has
an
amiable
way
to
her.
I
should
take
very
good
care
of
her
if
I
were
you.”

“I
intend
to.
Any
man
who
tries
to
harm
her—well,
I’m
too
small
to
be
a
Black
Ear,
and
I
make
no
claims
to
courage.”
See?
I
speak
the
same
tongue
you
do,
eunuch.
Hurt
her,
and
I’ll
have
your
head.

“I
will
leave
you.”
Varys
rose.
“I
know
how
weary
you
must
be.
I
only
wished
to
welcome
you,
my
lord,
and
tell
you
how
very
pleased
I
am
by
your
arrival.
We
have
dire
need
of
you
on
the
council.
Have
you
seen
the
comet?”

“I’m
short,
not
blind,”
Tyrion
said.
Out
on
the
kingsroad,
it
had
seemed
to
cover
half
the
sky,
outshining
the
crescent
moon.

“In
the
streets,
they
call
it
the
Red
Messenger,”
Varys
said.
“They
say
it
comes
as
a
herald
before
a
king,
to
warn
of
fire
and
blood
to
follow.”
The
eunuch
rubbed
his
powdered
hands
together.
“May
I
leave
you
with
a
bit
of
a
riddle,
Lord
Tyrion?”
He
did
not
wait
for
an
answer.
“In
a
room
sit
three
great
men,
a
king,
a
priest,
and
a
rich
man
with
his
gold.
Between
them
stands
a
sellsword,
a
little
man
of
common
birth
and
no
great
mind.
Each
of
the
great
ones
bids
him
slay
the
other
two.
‘Do
it’
says
the
king,
‘for
I
am
your
lawful
ruler.’
‘Do
it’
says
the
priest,
‘for
I
command
you
in
the
names
of
the
gods.’
‘Do
it’
says
the
rich
man,
‘and
all
this
gold
shall
be
yours.’
So
tell
me—who
lives
and
who
dies?”
Bowing
deeply,
the
eunuch
hurried
from
the
common
room
on
soft
slippered
feet.

When
he
was
gone,
Chella
gave
a
snort
and
Shae
wrinkled
up
her
pretty
face.
“The
rich
man
lives.
Doesn’t
he?”

Tyrion
sipped
at
his
wine,
thoughtful.
“Perhaps.
Or
not.
That
would
depend
on
the
sellsword,
it
seems.”
He
set
down
his
cup.
“Come,
let’s
go
upstairs.”

She
had
to
wait
for
him
at
the
top
of
the
steps,
for
her
legs
were
slim
and
supple
while
his
were
short
and
stunted
and
full
of
aches.
But
she
was
smiling
when
he
reached
her.
“Did
you
miss
me?”
she
teased
as
she
took
his
hand.

“Desperately,”
Tyrion
admitted.
Shae
only
stood
a
shade
over
five
feet,
yet
still
he
must
look
up
to
her…
but
in
her
case
he
found
he
did
not
mind.
She
was
sweet
to
look
up
at.

“You’ll
miss
me
all
the
time
in
your
Red
Keep,”
she
said
as
she
led
him
to
her
room.
“All
alone
in
your
cold
bed
in
your
Tower
of
the
Hand.”

“Too
true.”
Tyrion
would
gladly
have
kept
her
with
him,
but
his
lord
father
had
forbidden
it.
You
will
not
take
the
whore
to
court,
Lord
Tywin
had
commanded.
Bringing
her
to
the
city
was
as
much
defiance
as
he
dared.
All
his
authority
derived
from
his
father,
the
girl
had
to
understand
that.
“You
won’t
be
far,”
he
promised.
“You’ll
have
a
house,
with
guards
and
servants,
and
I’ll
visit
as
often
as
I’m
able.”

Shae
kicked
shut
the
door.
Through
the
cloudy
panes
of
the
narrow
window,
he
could
make
out
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
crowning
Visenya’s
Hill
but
Tyrion
was
distracted
by
a
different
sight.
Bending,
Shae
took
her
gown
by
the
hem,
drew
it
over
her
head,
and
tossed
it
aside.
She
did
not
believe
in
smallclothes.
“You’ll
never
be
able
to
rest,”
she
said
as
she
stood
before
him,
pink
and
nude
and
lovely,
one
hand
braced
on
her
hip.
“You’ll
think
of
me
every
time
you
go
to
bed.
Then
you’ll
get
hard
and
you’ll
have
no
one
to
help
you
and
you’ll
never
be
able
to
sleep
unless
you”—she
grinned
that
wicked
grin
Tyrion
liked
so
well—“is
that
why
they
call
it
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
m’lord?”

“Be
quiet
and
kiss
me,”
he
commanded.

He
could
taste
the
wine
on
her
lips,
and
feel
her
small
firm
breasts
pressed
against
him
as
her
fingers
moved
to
the
lacings
of
his
breeches.
“My
lion,”
she
whispered
when
he
broke
off
the
kiss
to
undress.
“My
sweet
lord,
my
giant
of
Lannister.”
Tyrion
pushed
her
toward
the
bed.
When
he
entered
her,
she
screamed
loud
enough
to
wake
Baelor
the
Blessed
in
his
tomb,
and
her
nails
left
gouges
in
his
back.
He’d
never
had
a
pain
he
liked
half
so
well.

Fool,
he
thought
to
himself
afterward,
as
they
lay
in
the
center
of
the
sagging
mattress
amidst
the
rumpled
sheets.
Will
you
never
learn,
dwarf?
She’s
a
whore,
damn
you,
it’s
your
coin
she
loves,
not
your
cock.
Remember
Tysha?
Yet
when
his
fingers
trailed
lightly
over
one
nipple,
it
stiffened
at
the
touch,
and
he
could
see
the
mark
on
her
breast
where
he’d
bitten
her
in
his
passion.

“So
what
will
you
do,
m’lord,
now
that
you’re
the
Hand
of
the
King?”
Shae
asked
him
as
he
cupped
that
warm
sweet
flesh.

“Something
Cersei
will
never
expect,”
Tyrion
murmured
softly
against
her
slender
neck.
“I’ll
do…
justice.”





BRAN

Bran
preferred
the
hard
stone
of
the
window
seat
to
the
comforts
of
his
featherbed
and
blankets.
Abed,
the
walls
pressed
close
and
the
ceiling
hung
heavy
above
him;
abed,
the
room
was
his
cell,
and
Winterfell
his
prison.
Yet
outside
his
window,
the
wide
world
still
called.

He
could
not
walk,
nor
climb
nor
hunt
nor
fight
with
a
wooden
sword
as
once
he
had,
but
he
could
still
look.
He
liked
to
watch
the
windows
begin
to
glow
all
over
Winterfell
as
candles
and
hearth
fires
were
lit
behind
the
diamond-shaped
panes
of
tower
and
hall,
and
he
loved
to
listen
to
the
direwolves
sing
to
the
stars.

Of
late,
he
often
dreamed
of
wolves.
They
are
talking
to
me,
brother
to
brother,
he
told
himself
when
the
direwolves
howled.
He
could
almost
understand
them…
not
quite,
not
truly,
but
almost…
as
if
they
were
singing
in
a
language
he
had
once
known
and
somehow
forgotten.
The
Walders
might
be
scared
of
them,
but
the
Starks
had
wolf
blood.
Old
Nan
told
him
so.
“Though
it
is
stronger
in
some
than
in
others,”
she
warned.

Summer’s
howls
were
long
and
sad,
full
of
grief
and
longing.
Shaggydog’s
were
more
savage.
Their
voices
echoed
through
the
yards
and
halls
until
the
castle
rang
and
it
seemed
as
though
some
great
pack
of
direwolves
haunted
Winterfell,
instead
of
only
two…
two
where
there
had
once
been
six.
Do
they
miss
their
brothers
and
sisters
too?
Bran
wondered.
Are
they
calling
to
Grey
Wind
and
Ghost,
to
Nymeria
and
Lady’s
Shade?
Do
they
want
them
to
come
home
and
be
a
pack
together?

“Who
can
know
the
mind
of
a
wolf?”
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
said
when
Bran
asked
him
why
they
howled.
Bran’s
lady
mother
had
named
him
castellan
of
Winterfell
in
her
absence,
and
his
duties
left
him
little
time
for
idle
questions.

“It’s
freedom
they’re
calling
for,”
declared
Farlen,
who
was
kennelmaster
and
had
no
more
love
for
the
direwolves
than
his
hounds
did.
“They
don’t
like
being
walled
up,
and
who’s
to
blame
them?
Wild
things
belong
in
the
wild,
not
in
a
castle.”

“They
want
to
hunt,”
agreed
Gage
the
cook
as
he
tossed
cubes
of
suet
in
a
great
kettle
of
stew.
“A
wolf
smells
better’n
any
man.
Like
as
not,
they’ve
caught
the
scent
o’
prey.”

Maester
Luwin
did
not
think
so.
“Wolves
often
howl
at
the
moon.
These
are
howling
at
the
comet.
See
how
bright
it
is,
Bran?
Perchance
they
think
it
is
the
moon.”

When
Bran
repeated
that
to
Osha,
she
laughed
aloud.
“Your
wolves
have
more
wit
than
your
maester,”
the
wildling
woman
said.
“They
know
truths
the
grey
man
has
forgotten.”
The
way
she
said
it
made
him
shiver,
and
when
he
asked
what
the
comet
meant,
she
answered,
“Blood
and
fire,
boy,
and
nothing
sweet.”

Bran
asked
Septon
Chayle
about
the
comet
while
they
were
sorting
through
some
scrolls
snatched
from
the
library
fire.
“It
is
the
sword
that
slays
the
season,”
he
replied,
and
soon
after
the
white
raven
came
from
Oldtown
bringing
word
of
autumn,
so
doubtless
he
was
right.

Though
Old
Nan
did
not
think
so,
and
she’d
lived
longer
than
any
of
them.
“Dragons,”
she
said,
lifting
her
head
and
sniffing.
She
was
near
blind
and
could
not
see
the
comet,
yet
she
claimed
she
could
smell
it.
“It
be
dragons,
boy,”
she
insisted.
Bran
got
no
princes
from
Nan,
no
more
than
he
ever
had.

Hodor
said
only,
“Hodor.”
That
was
all
he
ever
said.

And
still
the
direwolves
howled.
The
guards
on
the
walls
muttered
curses,
hounds
in
the
kennels
barked
furiously,
horses
kicked
at
their
stalls,
the
Walders
shivered
by
their
fire,
and
even
Maester
Luwin
complained
of
sleepless
nights.
Only
Bran
did
not
mind.
Ser
Rodrik
had
confined
the
wolves
to
the
godswood
after
Shaggydog
bit
Little
Walder,
but
the
stones
of
Winterfell
played
queer
tricks
with
sound,
and
sometimes
it
sounded
as
if
they
were
in
the
yard
right
below
Bran’s
window.
Other
times
he
would
have
sworn
they
were
up
on
the
curtain
walls,
loping
round
like
sentries.
He
wished
that
he
could
see
them.

He
could
see
the
comet
hanging
above
the
Guards
Hall
and
the
Bell
Tower,
and
farther
back
the
First
Keep,
squat
and
round,
its
gargoyles
black
shapes
against
the
bruised
purple
dusk.
Once
Bran
had
known
every
stone
of
those
buildings,
inside
and
out;
he
had
climbed
them
all,
scampering
up
walls
as
easily
as
other
boys
ran
down
stairs.
Their
rooftops
had
been
his
secret
places,
and
the
crows
atop
the
broken
tower
his
special
friends.

And
then
he
had
fallen.

Bran
did
not
remember
falling,
yet
they
said
he
had,
so
he
supposed
it
must
be
true.
He
had
almost
died.
When
he
saw
the
weatherworn
gargoyles
atop
the
First
Keep
where
it
had
happened,
he
got
a
queer
tight
feeling
in
his
belly.
And
now
he
could
not
climb,
nor
walk
nor
run
nor
swordfight,
and
the
dreams
he’d
dreamed
of
knighthood
had
soured
in
his
head.

Summer
had
howled
the
day
Bran
had
fallen,
and
for
long
after
as
he
lay
broken
in
his
bed;
Robb
had
told
him
so
before
he
went
away
to
war.
Summer
had
mourned
for
him,
and
Shaggydog
and
Grey
Wind
had
joined
in
his
grief.
And
the
night
the
bloody
raven
had
brought
word
of
their
father’s
death,
the
wolves
had
known
that
too.
Bran
had
been
in
the
maester’s
turret
with
Rickon
talking
of
the
children
of
the
forest
when
Summer
and
Shaggydog
had
drowned
out
Luwin
with
their
howls.

Who
are
they
mourning
now?
Had
some
enemy
slain
the
King
in
the
North,
who
used
to
be
his
brother
Robb?
Had
his
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow
fallen
from
the
Wall?
Had
his
mother
died,
or
one
of
his
sisters?
Or
was
this
something
else,
as
maester
and
septon
and
Old
Nan
seemed
to
think?

If
I
were
truly
a
direwolf,
I
would
understand
the
song,
he
thought
wistfully.
In
his
wolf
dreams,
he
could
race
up
the
sides
of
mountains,
jagged
icy
mountains
taller
than
any
tower,
and
stand
at
the
summit
beneath
the
full
moon
with
all
the
world
below
him,
the
way
it
used
to
be.

“Oooo,”
Bran
cried
tentatively.
He
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth
and
lifted
his
head
to
the
comet.
“Ooooooooooooooooooo,
ahooooooooooooooo,”
he
howled.
it
sounded
stupid,
high
and
hollow
and
quavering,
a
little
boy’s
howl,
not
a
wolf’s.
Yet
Summer
gave
answer,
his
deep
voice
drowning
out
Bran’s
thin
one,
and
Shaggydog
made
it
a
chorus.
Bran
haroooed
again.
They
howled
together,
last
of
their
pack.

The
noise
brought
a
guard
to
his
door,
Hayhead
with
the
wen
on
his
nose.
He
peered
in,
saw
Bran
howling
out
the
window,
and
said,
“What’s
this,
my
prince?”

It
made
Bran
feel
queer
when
they
called
him
prince,
though
he
was
Robb’s
heir,
and
Robb
was
King
in
the
North
now.
He
turned
his
head
to
howl
at
the
guard.
“Oooooooo.
Oo-oo-oooooooooooo.”

Hayhead
screwed
up
his
face.
“Now
you
stop
that
there.”

“Ooo-ooo-Oooooo.
Ooo-Ooo-Ooooooooooooooooo.”

The
guardsman
retreated.
When
he
came
back,
Maester
Luwin
was
with
him,
all
in
grey,
his
chain
tight
about
his
neck.
“Bran,
those
beasts
make
sufficient
noise
without
your
help.”
He
crossed
the
room
and
put
his
hand
on
the
boy’s
brow.
“The
hour
grows
late,
you
ought
to
be
fast
asleep.”

“I’m
talking
to
the
wolves.”
Bran
brushed
the
hand
away.

“Shall
I
have
Hayhead
carry
you
to
your
bed?”

“I
can
get
to
bed
myself.”
Mikken
had
hammered
a
row
of
iron
bars
into
the
wall,
so
Bran
could
pull
himself
about
the
room
with
his
arms.
It
was
slow
and
hard
and
it
made
his
shoulders
ache,
but
he
hated
being
carried.
“Anyway,
I
don’t
have
to
sleep
if
I
don’t
want
to.”

“All
men
must
sleep,
Bran.
Even
princes.”

“When
I
sleep
I
turn
into
a
wolf.”
Bran
turned
his
face
away
and
looked
back
out
into
the
night.
“Do
wolves
dream?”

“All
creatures
dream,
I
think,
yet
not
as
men
do.”

“Do
dead
men
dream?”
Bran
asked,
thinking
of
his
father.
In
the
dark
crypts
below
Winterfell,
a
stonemason
was
chiseling
out
his
father’s
likeness
in
granite.

“Some
say
yes,
some
no,”
the
maester
answered.
“The
dead
themselves
are
silent
on
the
matter.”

“Do
trees
dream?”

“Trees?
No…”

“They
do,”
Bran
said
with
sudden
certainty.
“They
dream
tree
dreams.
I
dream
of
a
tree
sometimes.
A
weirwood,
like
the
one
in
the
godswood.
It
calls
to
me.
The
wolf
dreams
are
better.
I
smell
things,
and
sometimes
I
can
taste
the
blood.”

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
where
it
chafed
his
neck.
“If
you
would
only
spend
more
time
with
the
other
children—”

“I
hate
the
other
children,”
Bran
said,
meaning
the
Walders.
“I
commanded
you
to
send
them
away.”

Luwin
grew
stern.
“The
Freys
are
your
lady
mother’s
wards,
sent
here
to
be
fostered
at
her
express
command.
It
is
not
for
you
to
expel
them,
nor
is
it
kind.
If
we
turned
them
out,
where
would
they
go?”

“Home.
It’s
their
fault
you
won’t
let
me
have
Summer.”

“The
Frey
boy
did
not
ask
to
be
attacked,”
the
maester
said,
“no
more
than
I
did.”

“That
was
Shaggydog.”
Rickon’s
big
black
wolf
was
so
wild
he
even
frightened
Bran
at
times.
“Summer
never
bit
anyone.”

“Summer
ripped
out
a
man’s
throat
in
this
very
chamber,
or
have
you
forgotten?
The
truth
is,
those
sweet
pups
you
and
your
brothers
found
in
the
snow
have
grown
into
dangerous
beasts.
The
Frey
boys
are
wise
to
be
wary
of
them.”

“We
should
put
the
Walders
in
the
godswood.
They
could
play
lord
of
the
crossing
all
they
want,
and
Summer
could
sleep
with
me
again.
If
I’m
the
prince,
why
won’t
you
heed
me?
I
wanted
to
ride
Dancer,
but
Alebelly
wouldn’t
let
me
past
the
gate.”

“And
rightly
so.
The
wolfswood
is
full
of
danger;
your
last
ride
should
have
taught
you
that.
Would
you
want
some
outlaw
to
take
you
captive
and
sell
you
to
the
Lannisters?”

“Summer
would
save
me,”
Bran
insisted
stubbornly.
“Princes
should
be
allowed
to
sail
the
sea
and
hunt
boar
in
the
wolfswood
and
joust
with
lances.”

“Bran,
child,
why
do
you
torment
yourself
so?
One
day
you
may
do
some
of
these
things,
but
now
you
are
only
a
boy
of
eight.”

“I’d
sooner
be
a
wolf.
Then
I
could
live
in
the
wood
and
sleep
when
I
wanted,
and
I
could
find
Arya
and
Sansa.
I’d
smell
where
they
were
and
go
save
them,
and
when
Robb
went
to
battle
I’d
fight
beside
him
like
Grey
Wind.
I’d
tear
out
the
Kingslayer’s
throat
with
my
teeth,
rip,
and
then
the
war
would
be
over
and
everyone
would
come
back
to
Winterfell.
If
I
was
a
wolf…”
He
howled.
“Ooo-ooo-oooooooooooo.”

Luwin
raised
his
voice.
“A
true
prince
would
welcome—”

“AAHOOOOOOO,”
Bran
howled,
louder.
“AAHOOOOOOOOOOOO.”

The
maester
surrendered.
“As
you
will,
child.”
With
a
look
that
was
part
grief
and
part
disgust,
he
left
the
bedchamber.

Howling
lost
its
savor
once
Bran
was
alone.
After
a
time
he
quieted.
I
did
welcome
them,
he
told
himself,
resentful.
I
was
the
lord
in
Winterfell,
a
true
lord,
he
can’t
say
I
wasn’t.
When
the
Walders
had
arrived
from
the
Twins,
it
had
been
Rickon
who
wanted
them
gone.
A
baby
of
four,
he
had
screamed
that
he
wanted
Mother
and
Father
and
Robb,
not
these
strangers.
It
had
been
up
to
Bran
to
soothe
him
and
bid
the
Freys
welcome.
He
had
offered
them
meat
and
mead
and
a
seat
by
the
fire,
and
even
Maester
Luwin
had
said
afterward
that
he’d
done
well.

Only
that
was
before
the
game.

The
game
was
played
with
a
log,
a
staff,
a
body
of
water,
and
a
great
deal
of
shouting.
The
water
was
the
most
important,
Walder
and
Walder
assured
Bran.
You
could
use
a
plank
or
even
a
series
of
stones,
and
a
branch
could
be
your
staff.
You
didn’t
have
to
shout.
But
without
water,
there
was
no
game.
As
Maester
Luwin
and
Ser
Rodrik
were
not
about
to
let
the
children
go
wandering
off
into
the
wolfswood
in
search
of
a
stream,
they
made
do
with
one
of
the
murky
pools
in
the
godswood.
Walder
and
Walder
had
never
seen
hot
water
bubbling
from
the
ground
before,
but
they
both
allowed
how
it
would
make
the
game
even
better.

Both
of
them
were
called
Walder
Frey.
Big
Walder
said
there
were
bunches
of
Walders
at
the
Twins,
all
named
after
the
boys’
grandfather,
Lord
Walder
Frey.
“We
have
our
own
names
at
Winterfell,”
Rickon
told
them
haughtily
when
he
heard
that.

The
way
their
game
was
played,
you
laid
the
log
across
the
water,
and
one
player
stood
in
the
middle
with
the
stick.
He
was
the
lord
of
the
crossing,
and
when
one
of
the
other
players
came
up,
he
had
to
say,
“I
am
the
lord
of
the
crossing,
who
goes
there?”
And
the
other
player
had
to
make
up
a
speech
about
who
they
were
and
why
they
should
be
allowed
to
cross.
The
lord
could
make
them
swear
oaths
and
answer
questions.
They
didn’t
have
to
tell
the
truth,
but
the
oaths
were
binding
unless
they
said
“Maybaps,”
so
the
trick
was
to
say
“Mayhaps”
so
the
lord
of
the
crossing
didn’t
notice.
Then
you
could
try
and
knock
the
lord
into
the
water
and
you
got
to
be
lord
of
the
crossing,
but
only
if
you’d
said
“Mayhaps.”
Otherwise
you
were
out
of
the
game.
The
lord
got
to
knock
anyone
in
the
water
anytime
he
pleased,
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
got
to
use
a
stick.

In
practice,
the
game
seemed
to
come
down
to
mostly
shoving,
hitting,
and
falling
into
the
water,
along
with
a
lot
of
loud
arguments
about
whether
or
not
someone
had
said
“Mayhaps.”
Little
Walder
was
lord
of
the
crossing
more
often
than
not.

He
was
Little
Walder
even
though
he
was
tall
and
stout,
with
a
red
face
and
a
big
round
belly.
Big
Walder
was
sharp-faced
and
skinny
and
half
a
foot
shorter.
“He’s
fifty-two
days
older
than
me,”
Little
Walder
explained,
“so
he
was
bigger
at
first,
but
I
grew
faster.”

“We’re
cousins,
not
brothers,”
added
Big
Walder,
the
little
one.
“I’m
Walder
son
of
Jammos.
My
father
was
Lord
Walder’s
son
by
his
fourth
wife.
He’s
Walder
son
of
Merrett.
His
grandmother
was
Lord
Walder’s
third
wife,
the
Crakehall.
He’s
ahead
of
me
in
the
line
of
succession
even
though
I’m
older.”

“Only
by
fifty-two
days,”
Little
Walder
objected.
“And
neither
of
us
will
ever
hold
the
Twins,
stupid.”

“I
will,”
Big
Walder
declared.
“We’re
not
the
only
Walders
either.
Ser
Stevron
has
a
grandson,
Black
Walder,
he’s
fourth
in
line
of
succession,
and
there’s
Red
Walder,
Ser
Emmon’s
son,
and
Bastard
Walder,
who
isn’t
in
the
line
at
all.
He’s
called
Walder
Rivers
not
Walder
Frey.
Plus
there’s
girls
named
Walda.”

“And
Tyr.
You
always
forget
Tyr.”

“He’s
Waltyr,
not
Walder,”
Big
Walder
said
airily.
“And
he’s
after
us,
so
he
doesn’t
matter.
Anyhow,
I
never
liked
him.”

Ser
Rodrik
decreed
that
they
would
share
Jon
Snow’s
old
bedchamber,
since
Jon
was
in
the
Night’s
Watch
and
never
coming
back.
Bran
hated
that;
it
made
him
feel
as
if
the
Freys
were
trying
to
steal
Jon’s
place.

He
had
watched
wistfully
while
the
Walders
contested
with
Turnip
the
cook’s
boy
and
Joseth’s
girls
Bandy
and
Shyra.
The
Walders
had
decreed
that
Bran
should
be
the
judge
and
decide
whether
or
not
people
had
said
“Mayhaps,”
but
as
soon
as
they
started
playing
they
forgot
all
about
him.

The
shouts
and
splashes
soon
drew
others:
Palla
the
kennel
girl,
Cayn’s
boy
Calon,
Tom
Too
whose
father
Fat
Tom
had
died
with
Bran’s
father
at
King’s
Landing.
Before
very
long,
every
one
of
them
was
soaked
and
muddy.
Palla
was
brown
from
head
to
heel,
with
moss
in
her
hair,
breathless
from
laughter.
Bran
had
not
heard
so
much
laughing
since
the
night
the
bloody
raven
came.
If
I
had
my
legs,
I’d
knock
all
of
them
into
the
water,
he
thought
bitterly.
No
one
would
ever
be
lord
of
the
crossing
but
me.

Finally
Rickon
came
running
into
the
godswood,
Shaggydog
at
his
heels.
He
watched
Turnip
and
Little
Walder
struggle
for
the
stick
until
Turnip
lost
his
footing
and
went
in
with
a
huge
splash,
arms
waving.
Rickon
yelled,
“Me!
Me
now!
I
want
to
play!”
Little
Walder
beckoned
him
on,
and
Shaggydog
started
to
follow.
“No,
Shaggy,”
his
brother
commanded.
“Wolves
can’t
play.
You
stay
with
Bran.”
And
he
did…

…until
Little
Walder
had
smacked
Rickon
with
the
stick,
square
across
his
belly.
Before
Bran
could
blink,
the
black
wolf
was
flying
over
the
plank,
there
was
blood
in
the
water,
the
Walders
were
shrieking
red
murder,
Rickon
sat
in
the
mud
laughing,
and
Hodor
came
lumbering
in
shouting
“Hodor!
Hodor!
Hodor!”

After
that,
oddly,
Rickon
decided
he
liked
the
Walders.
They
never
played
lord
of
the
crossing
again,
but
they
played
other
games—monsters
and
maidens,
rats
and
cats,
come-into-my-castle,
all
sorts
of
things.
With
Rickon
by
their
side,
the
Walders
plundered
the
kitchens
for
pies
and
honeycombs,
raced
round
the
walls,
tossed
bones
to
the
pups
in
the
kennels,
and
trained
with
wooden
swords
under
Ser
Rodrik’s
sharp
eye.
Rickon
even
showed
them
the
deep
vaults
under
the
earth
where
the
stonemason
was
carving
father’s
tomb.
“You
had
no
right!”
Bran
screamed
at
his
brother
when
he
heard.
“That
was
our
place,
a
Stark
place!”
But
Rickon
never
cared.

The
door
to
his
bedchamber
opened.
Maester
Luwin
was
carrying
a
green
jar,
and
this
time
Osha
and
Hayhead
came
with
him.
“I’ve
made
you
a
sleeping
draught,
Bran.”

Osha
scooped
him
up
in
her
bony
arms.
She
was
very
tall
for
a
woman,
and
wiry
strong.
She
bore
him
effortlessly
to
his
bed.

“This
will
give
you
dreamless
sleep,”
Maester
Luwin
said
as
he
pulled
the
stopper
from
the
jar.
“Sweet,
dreamless
sleep.”

“It
will?”
Bran
said,
wanting
to
believe.

“Yes.
Drink.”

Bran
drank.
The
potion
was
thick
and
chalky,
but
there
was
honey
in
it
so
it
went
down
easy.

“Come
the
morn,
you’ll
feel
better.”
Luwin
gave
Bran
a
smile
and
a
pat
as
he
took
his
leave.

Osha
lingered
behind.
“Is
it
the
wolf
dreams
again?”

Bran
nodded.

“You
should
not
fight
so
hard,
boy.
I
see
you
talking
to
the
heart
tree.
Might
be
the
gods
are
trying
to
talk
back.”

“The
gods?”
he
murmured,
drowsy
already.
Osha’s
face
grew
blurry
and
grey.
Sweet,
dreamless
sleep,
Bran
thought.

Yet
when
the
darkness
closed
over
him,
he
found
himself
in
the
godswood,
moving
silently
beneath
green-grey
sentinels
and
gnarled
oaks
as
old
as
time.
I
am
walking,
he
thought,
exulting.
Part
of
him
knew
that
it
was
only
a
dream,
but
even
the
dream
of
walking
was
better
than
the
truth
of
his
bedchamber,
walls
and
ceiling
and
door.

It
was
dark
amongst
the
trees,
but
the
comet
lit
his
way,
and
his
feet
were
sure.
He
was
moving
on
four
good
legs,
strong
and
swift,
and
he
could
feel
the
ground
underfoot,
the
soft
crackling
of
fallen
leaves,
thick
roots
and
hard
stones,
the
deep
layers
of
humus.
It
was
a
good
feeling.

The
smells
filled
his
head,
alive
and
intoxicating;
the
green
muddy
stink
of
the
hot
pools,
the
perfume
of
rich
rotting
earth
beneath
his
paws,
the
squirrels
in
the
oaks.
The
scent
of
squirrel
made
him
remember
the
taste
of
hot
blood
and
the
way
the
bones
would
crack
between
his
teeth.
Slaver
filled
his
mouth.
He
had
eaten
no
more
than
half
a
day
past,
but
there
was
no
joy
in
dead
meat,
even
deer.
He
could
hear
the
squirrels
chittering
and
rustling
above
him,
safe
among
their
leaves,
but
they
knew
better
than
to
come
down
to
where
his
brother
and
he
were
prowling.

He
could
smell
his
brother
too,
a
familiar
scent,
strong
and
earthy,
his
scent
as
black
as
his
coat.
His
brother
was
loping
around
the
walls,
full
of
fury.
Round
and
round
he
went,
night
after
day
after
night,
tireless,
searching…
for
prey,
for
a
way
out,
for
his
mother,
his
littermates,
his
pack…
searching,
searching,
and
never
finding.

Behind
the
trees
the
walls
rose,
piles
of
dead
man-rock
that
loomed
all
about
this
speck
of
living
wood.
Speckled
grey
they
rose,
and
moss-spotted,
yet
thick
and
strong
and
higher
than
any
wolf
could
hope
to
leap.
Cold
iron
and
splintery
wood
closed
off
the
only
holes
through
the
piled
stones
that
hemmed
them
in.
His
brother
would
stop
at
every
hole
and
bare
his
fangs
in
rage,
but
the
ways
stayed
closed.

He
had
done
the
same
the
first
night,
and
learned
that
it
was
no
good.
Snarls
would
open
no
paths
here.
Circling
the
walls
would
not
push
them
back.
Lifting
a
leg
and
marking
the
trees
would
keep
no
men
away.
The
world
had
tightened
around
them,
but
beyond
the
walled
wood
still
stood
the
great
grey
caves
of
man-rock.
Winterfell,
he
remembered,
the
sound
coming
to
him
suddenly.
Beyond
its
sky-tall
man-cliffs
the
true
world
was
calling,
and
he
knew
he
must
answer
or
die.





ARYA

They
traveled
dawn
to
dusk,
past
woods
and
orchards
and
neatly
tended
fields,
through
small
villages,
crowded
market
towns,
and
stout
holdfasts.
Come
dark,
they
would
make
camp
and
eat
by
the
light
of
the
Red
Sword.
The
men
took
turns
standing
watch.
Arya
would
glimpse
firelight
flickering
through
the
trees
from
the
camps
of
other
travelers.
There
seemed
to
be
more
camps
every
night,
and
more
traffic
on
the
kingsroad
by
day.

Morn,
noon,
and
night
they
came,
old
folks
and
little
children,
big
men
and
small
ones,
barefoot
girls
and
women
with
babes
at
their
breasts.
Some
drove
farm
wagons
or
bumped
along
in
the
back
of
ox
carts.
More
rode:
draft
horses,
ponies,
mules,
donkeys,
anything
that
would
walk
or
run
or
roll.
One
woman
led
a
milk
cow
with
a
little
girl
on
its
back.
Arya
saw
a
smith
pushing
a
wheelbarrow
with
his
tools
inside,
hammers
and
tongs
and
even
an
anvil,
and
a
little
while
later
a
different
man
with
a
different
wheelbarrow,
only
inside
this
one
were
two
babies
in
a
blanket.
Most
came
on
foot,
with
their
goods
on
their
shoulders
and
weary,
wary
looks
upon
their
faces.
They
walked
south,
toward
the
city,
toward
King’s
Landing,
and
only
one
in
a
hundred
spared
so
much
as
a
word
for
Yoren
and
his
charges,
traveling
north.
She
wondered
why
no
one
else
was
going
the
same
way
as
them.

Many
of
the
travelers
were
armed;
Arya
saw
daggers
and
dirks,
scythes
and
axes,
and
here
and
there
a
sword.
Some
had
made
clubs
from
tree
limbs,
or
carved
knobby
staffs.
They
fingered
their
weapons
and
gave
lingering
looks
at
the
wagons
as
they
rolled
by,
yet
in
the
end
they
let
the
column
pass.
Thirty
was
too
many,
no
matter
what
they
had
in
those
wagons.

Look
with
your
eyes,
Syrio
had
said,
listen
with
your
ears.

One
day
a
madwoman
began
to
scream
at
them
from
the
side
of
the
road.
“Fools!
They’ll
kill
you,
fools!”
She
was
scarecrow
thin,
with
hollow
eyes
and
bloody
feet.

The
next
morning,
a
sleek
merchant
on
a
grey
mare
reined
up
by
Yoren
and
offered
to
buy
his
wagons
and
everything
in
them
for
a
quarter
of
their
worth.
“It’s
war,
they’ll
take
what
they
want,
you’ll
do
better
selling
to
me,
my
friend.”
Yoren
turned
away
with
a
twist
of
his
crooked
shoulders,
and
spat.

Arya
noticed
the
first
grave
that
same
day;
a
small
mound
beside
the
road,
dug
for
a
child.
A
crystal
had
been
set
in
the
soft
earth,
and
Lommy
wanted
to
take
it
until
the
Bull
told
him
he’d
better
leave
the
dead
alone.
A
few
leagues
farther
on,
Praed
pointed
out
more
graves,
a
whole
row
freshly
dug.
After
that,
a
day
hardly
passed
without
one.

One
time
Arya
woke
in
the
dark,
frightened
for
no
reason
she
could
name.
Above,
the
Red
Sword
shared
the
sky
with
half
a
thousand
stars.
The
night
seemed
oddly
quiet
to
her,
though
she
could
hear
Yoren’s
muttered
snores,
the
crackle
of
the
fire,
even
the
muffled
stirrings
of
the
donkeys.
Yet
somehow
it
felt
as
though
the
world
were
holding
its
breath,
and
the
silence
made
her
shiver.
She
went
back
to
sleep
clutching
Needle.

Come
morning,
when
Praed
did
not
awaken,
Arya
realized
that
it
had
been
his
coughing
she
had
missed.
They
dug
a
grave
of
their
own
then,
burying
the
sellsword
where
he’d
slept.
Yoren
stripped
him
of
his
valuables
before
they
threw
the
dirt
on
him.
One
man
claimed
his
boots,
another
his
dagger.
His
mail
shirt
and
helm
were
parceled
out.
His
longsword
Yoren
handed
to
the
Bull.
“Arms
like
yours,
might
be
you
can
learn
to
use
this,”
he
told
him.
A
boy
called
Tarber
tossed
a
handful
of
acorns
on
top
of
Praed’s
body,
so
an
oak
might
grow
to
mark
his
place.

That
evening
they
stopped
in
a
village
at
an
ivy-covered
inn.
Yoren
counted
the
coins
in
his
purse
and
decided
they
had
enough
for
a
hot
meal.
“We’ll
sleep
outside,
same
as
ever,
but
they
got
a
bathhouse
here,
if
any
of
you
feels
the
need
o’
hot
water
and
a
lick
o’
soap.”

Arya
did
not
dare,
even
though
she
smelled
as
bad
as
Yoren
by
now,
all
sour
and
stinky.
Some
of
the
creatures
living
in
her
clothes
had
come
all
the
way
from
Flea
Bottom
with
her;
it
didn’t
seem
right
to
drown
them.
Tarber
and
Hot
Pie
and
the
Bull
joined
the
line
of
men
headed
for
the
tubs.
Others
settled
down
in
front
of
the
bathhouse.
The
rest
crowded
into
the
common
room.
Yoren
even
sent
Lommy
out
with
tankards
for
the
three
in
fetters,
who’d
been
left
chained
up
in
the
back
of
their
wagon.

Washed
and
unwashed
alike
supped
on
hot
pork
pies
and
baked
apples.
The
innkeeper
gave
them
a
round
of
beer
on
the
house.
“I
had
a
brother
took
the
black,
years
ago.
Serving
boy,
clever,
but
one
day
he
got
seen
filching
pepper
from
m’lord’s
table.
He
liked
the
taste
of
it,
is
all.
just
a
pinch
o’
pepper,
but
Ser
Malcolm
was
a
hard
man.
You
get
pepper
on
the
Wall?”
When
Yoren
shook
his
head,
the
man
sighed.
“Shame.
Lync
loved
that
pepper.”

Arya
sipped
at
her
tankard
cautiously,
between
spoonfuls
of
pie
still
warm
from
the
oven.
Her
father
sometimes
let
them
have
a
cup
of
beer,
she
remembered.
Sansa
used
to
make
a
face
at
the
taste
and
say
that
wine
was
ever
so
much
finer,
but
Arya
had
liked
it
well
enough.
it
made
her
sad
to
think
of
Sansa
and
her
father.

The
inn
was
full
of
people
moving
south,
and
the
common
room
erupted
in
scorn
when
Yoren
said
they
were
traveling
the
other
way.
“You’ll
be
back
soon
enough,”
the
innkeeper
vowed.
“There’s
no
going
north.
Half
the
fields
are
burnt,
and
what
folks
are
left
are
walled
up
inside
their
holdfasts.
One
bunch
rides
off
at
dawn
and
another
one
shows
up
by
dusk.”

“That’s
nothing
to
us,”
Yoren
insisted
stubbornly.
“Tully
or
Lannister,
makes
no
matter.
The
Watch
takes
no
part.”

Lord
Tully
is
my
grandfather,
Arya
thought.
It
mattered
to
her,
but
she
chewed
her
lip
and
kept
quiet,
listening.

“It’s
more
than
Lannister
and
Tully,”
the
innkeeper
said.
“There’s
wild
men
down
from
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
try
telling
them
you
take
no
part.
And
the
Starks
are
in
it
too,
the
young
lord’s
come
down,
the
dead
Hand’s
son…”

Arya
sat
up
straight,
straining
to
hear.
Did
he
mean
Robb?

“I
heard
the
boy
rides
to
battle
on
a
wolf,”
said
a
yellow-haired
man
with
a
tankard
in
his
hand.

“Fool’s
talk.”
Yoren
spat.

“The
man
I
heard
it
from,
he
saw
it
himself.
A
wolf
big
as
a
horse,
he
swore.”

“Swearing
don’t
make
it
true,
Hod,”
the
innkeeper
said.
“You
keep
swearing
you’ll
pay
what
you
owe
me,
and
I’ve
yet
to
see
a
copper.”
The
common
room
erupted
in
laughter,
and
the
man
with
the
yellow
hair
turned
red.

“It’s
been
a
bad
year
for
wolves,”
volunteered
a
sallow
man
in
a
travel-stained
green
cloak.
“Around
the
Gods
Eye,
the
packs
have
grown
bolder’n
anyone
can
remember.
Sheep,
cows,
dogs,
makes
no
matter,
they
kill
as
they
like,
and
they
got
no
fear
of
men.
It’s
worth
your
life
to
go
into
those
woods
by
night.”

“Ah,
that’s
more
tales,
and
no
more
true
than
the
other.”

“I
heard
the
same
thing
from
my
cousin,
and
she’s
not
the
sort
to
lie,”
an
old
woman
said.
“She
says
there’s
this
great
pack,
hundreds
of
them,
mankillers.
The
one
that
leads
them
is
a
she-wolf,
a
bitch
from
the
seventh
hell.”

A
she-wolf.
Arya
sloshed
her
beer,
wondering.
Was
the
Gods
Eye
near
the
Trident?
She
wished
she
had
a
map.
It
had
been
near
the
Trident
that
she’d
left
Nymeria.
She
hadn’t
wanted
to,
but
Jory
said
they
had
no
choice,
that
if
the
wolf
came
back
with
them
she’d
be
killed
for
biting
Joffrey,
even
though
he’d
deserved
it.
They’d
had
to
shout
and
scream
and
throw
stones,
and
it
wasn’t
until
a
few
of
Arya’s
stones
struck
home
that
the
direwolf
had
finally
stopped
following
them.
She
probably
wouldn’t
even
know
me
now,
Arya
thought.
Or
if
she
did,
she’d
hate
me.

The
man
in
the
green
cloak
said,
“I
heard
how
this
hellbitch
walked
into
a
village
one
day…
a
market
day,
people
everywhere,
and
she
walks
in
bold
as
you
please
and
tears
a
baby
from
his
mother’s
arms.
When
the
tale
reached
Lord
Mooton,
him
and
his
sons
swore
they’d
put
an
end
to
her.
They
tracked
her
to
her
lair
with
a
pack
of
wolfhounds,
and
barely
escaped
with
their
skins.
Not
one
of
those
dogs
came
back,
not
one.”

“That’s
just
a
story,”
Arya
blurted
out
before
she
could
stop
herself.
“Wolves
don’t
eat
babies.”

“And
what
would
you
know
about
it,
lad?”
asked
the
man
in
the
green
cloak.

Before
she
could
think
of
an
answer,
Yoren
had
her
by
the
arm.
“The
boy’s
greensick
on
beer,
that’s
all
it
is.”

“No
I’m
not.
They
don’t
eat
babies…”

“Outside,
boy…
and
see
that
you
stay
there
until
you
learn
to
shut
your
mouth
when
men
are
talking.”
He
gave
her
a
stiff
shove,
toward
the
side
door
that
led
back
to
the
stables.
“Go
on
now.
See
that
the
stableboy
has
watered
our
horses.”

Arya
went
outside,
stiff
with
fury.
“They
don’t,”
she
muttered,
kicking
at
a
rock
as
she
stalked
off.
It
went
rolling
and
fetched
up
under
the
wagons.

“Boy,”
a
friendly
voice
called
out.
“Lovely
boy.”

One
of
the
men
in
irons
was
talking
to
her.
Warily,
Arya
approached
the
wagon,
one
hand
on
Needle’s
hilt.

The
prisoner
lifted
an
empty
tankard,
his
chains
rattling.
“A
man
could
use
another
taste
of
beer.
A
man
has
a
thirst,
wearing
these
heavy
bracelets.”
He
was
the
youngest
of
the
three,
slender,
fine-featured,
always
smiling.
His
hair
was
red
on
one
side
and
white
on
the
other,
all
matted
and
filthy
from
cage
and
travel.
“A
man
could
use
a
bath
too,”
he
said,
when
he
saw
the
way
Arya
was
looking
at
him.
“A
boy
could
make
a
friend.”

“I
have
friends,”
Arya
said.

“None
I
can
see,”
said
the
one
without
a
nose.
He
was
squat
and
thick,
with
huge
hands.
Black
hair
covered
his
arms
and
legs
and
chest,
even
his
back.
He
reminded
Arya
of
a
drawing
she
had
once
seen
in
a
book,
of
an
ape
from
the
Summer
Isles.
The
hole
in
his
face
made
it
hard
to
look
at
him
for
long.

The
bald
one
opened
his
mouth
and
hissed
like
some
immense
white
lizard.
When
Arya
flinched
back,
startled,
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
waggled
his
tongue
at
her,
only
it
was
more
a
stump
than
a
tongue.
“Stop
that,”
she
blurted.

“A
man
does
not
choose
his
companions
in
the
black
cells,”
the
handsome
one
with
the
red-and-white
hair
said.
Something
about
the
way
he
talked
reminded
her
of
Syrio;
it
was
the
same,
yet
different
too.
“These
two,
they
have
no
courtesy.
A
man
must
ask
forgiveness.
You
are
called
Arry,
is
that
not
so?”

“Lumpyhead,”
said
the
noseless
one.
“Lumpyhead
Lumpyface
Stickboy.
Have
a
care,
Lorath,
he’ll
hit
you
with
his
stick.”

“A
man
must
be
ashamed
of
the
company
he
keeps,
Arry,”
the
handsome
one
said.
“This
man
has
the
honor
to
be
Jaqen
H’ghar,
once
of
the
Free
City
of
Lorath.
Would
that
he
were
home.
This
man’s
ill-bred
companions
in
captivity
are
named
Rorge”—he
waved
his
tankard
at
the
noseless
man—“and
Biter.”
Biter
hissed
at
her
again,
displaying
a
mouthful
of
yellowed
teeth
filed
into
points.
“A
man
must
have
some
name,
is
that
not
so?
Biter
cannot
speak
and
Biter
cannot
write,
yet
his
teeth
are
very
sharp,
so
a
man
calls
him
Biter
and
he
smiles.
Are
you
charmed?”

Arya
backed
away
from
the
wagon.
“No.”
They
can’t
hurt
me,
she
told
herself,
they’re
all
chained
up.

He
turned
his
tankard
upside
down.
“A
man
must
weep.”

Rorge,
the
noseless
one,
flung
his
drinking
cup
at
her
with
a
curse.
His
manacles
made
him
clumsy,
yet
even
so
he
would
have
sent
the
heavy
pewter
tankard
crashing
into
her
head
if
Arya
hadn’t
leapt
aside.
“You
get
us
some
beer,
pimple.
Now!”

“You
shut
your
mouth!”
Arya
tried
to
think
what
Syrio
would
have
done.
She
drew
her
wooden
practice
sword.

“Come
closer,”
Rorge
said,
“and
I’ll
shove
that
stick
up
your
bunghole
and
fuck
you
bloody.”

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Arya
made
herself
approach
the
wagon.
Every
step
was
harder
than
the
one
before.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine,
calm
as
still
water.
The
words
sang
in
her
head.
Syrio
would
not
have
been
afraid.
She
was
almost
close
enough
to
touch
the
wheel
when
Biter
lurched
to
his
feet
and
grabbed
for
her,
his
irons
clanking
and
rattling.
The
manacles
brought
his
hands
up
short,
half
a
foot
from
her
face.
He
hissed.

She
hit
him.
Hard,
right
between
his
little
eyes.

Screaming,
Biter
reeled
back,
and
then
threw
all
his
weight
against
his
chains.
The
links
slithered
and
turned
and
grew
taut,
and
Arya
heard
the
creak
of
old
dry
wood
as
the
great
iron
rings
strained
against
the
floorboards
of
the
wagon.
Huge
pale
hands
groped
for
her
while
veins
bulged
along
Biter’s
arms,
but
the
bonds
held,
and
finally
the
man
collapsed
backward.
Blood
ran
from
the
weeping
sores
on
his
cheeks.

“A
boy
has
more
courage
than
sense,”
the
one
who
had
named
himself
Jaqen
H’ghar
observed.

Arya
edged
backward
away
from
the
wagon.
When
she
felt
the
hand
on
her
shoulder,
she
whirled,
bringing
up
her
stick
sword
again,
but
it
was
only
the
Bull.
“What
are
you
doing?”

He
raised
his
hands
defensively.
“Yoren
said
none
of
us
should
go
near
those
three.”

“They
don’t
scare
me,”
Arya
said.

“Then
you’re
stupid.
They
scare
me.”
The
Bull’s
hand
fell
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword,
and
Rorge
began
to
laugh.
“Let’s
get
away
from
them.”

Arya
scuffed
at
the
ground
with
her
foot,
but
she
let
the
Bull
lead
her
around
to
the
front
of
the
inn.
Rorge’s
laughter
and
Biter’s
hissing
followed
them.
“Want
to
fight?”
she
asked
the
Bull.
She
wanted
to
hit
something.

He
blinked
at
her,
startled.
Strands
of
thick
black
hair,
still
wet
from
the
bathhouse,
fell
across
his
deep
blue
eyes.
“I’d
hurt
you.”

“You
would
not.”

“You
don’t
know
how
strong
I
am.”

“You
don’t
know
how
quick
I
am.”

“You’re
asking
for
it,
Arry.”
He
drew
Praed’s
longsword.
“This
is
cheap
steel,
but
it’s
a
real
sword.”

Arya
unsheathed
Needle.
“This
is
good
steel,
so
it’s
realer
than
yours.”

The
Bull
shook
his
head.
“Promise
not
to
cry
if
I
cut
you?”

“I’ll
promise
if
you
will.”
She
turned
sideways,
into
her
water
dancer’s
stance,
but
the
Bull
did
not
move.
He
was
looking
at
something
behind
her.
“What’s
wrong?”

“Gold
cloaks.”
His
face
closed
up
tight.

It
couldn’t
be,
Arya
thought,
but
when
she
glanced
back,
they
were
riding
up
the
kingsroad,
six
in
the
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch.
One
was
an
officer;
he
wore
a
black
enamel
breastplate
ornamented
with
four
golden
disks.
They
drew
up
in
front
of
the
inn.
Look
with
your
eyes,
Syrio’s
voice
seemed
to
whisper.
Her
eyes
saw
white
lather
under
their
saddles;
the
horses
had
been
ridden
long
and
hard.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
took
the
Bull
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
back
behind
a
tall
flowering
hedge.

“What
is
it?”
he
asked.
“What
are
you
doing?
Let
go.”

“Quiet
as
a
shadow,”
she
whispered,
pulling
him
down.

Some
of
Yoren’s
other
charges
were
sitting
in
front
of
the
bathhouse,
waiting
their
turn
at
a
tub.
“You
men,”
one
of
the
gold
cloaks
shouted.
“You
the
ones
left
to
take
the
black?”

“We
might
be,”
came
the
cautious
answer.

“We’d
rather
join
you
boys,”
old
Reysen
said.
“We
hear
it’s
cold
on
that
Wall.”

The
gold
cloak
officer
dismounted.
“I
have
a
warrant
for
a
certain
boy—”

Yoren
stepped
out
of
the
inn,
fingering
his
tangled
black
beard.
“Who
is
it
wants
this
boy?”

The
other
gold
cloaks
were
dismounting
to
stand
beside
their
horses.
“Why
are
we
hiding?”
the
Bull
whispered.

“It’s
me
they
want,”
Arya
whispered
back.
His
ear
smelled
of
soap.
“You
be
quiet.”

“The
queen
wants
him,
old
man,
not
that
it’s
your
concern,”
the
officer
said,
drawing
a
ribbon
from
his
belt.
“Here,
Her
Grace’s
seal
and
warrant.”

Behind
the
hedge,
the
Bull
shook
his
head
doubtfully.
“Why
would
the
queen
want
you,
Arry?”

She
punched
his
shoulder.
“Be
quiet!”

Yoren
fingered
the
warrant
ribbon
with
its
blob
of
golden
wax.
“Pretty.”
He
spit.
“Thing
is,
the
boy’s
in
the
Night’s
Watch
now.
What
he
done
back
in
the
city
don’t
mean
piss-all.”

“The
queen’s
not
interested
in
your
views,
old
man,
and
neither
am
I,”
the
officer
said.
“I’ll
have
the
boy.”

Arya
thought
about
running,
but
she
knew
she
wouldn’t
get
far
on
her
donkey
when
the
gold
cloaks
had
horses.
And
she
was
so
tired
of
running.
She’d
run
when
Ser
Meryn
came
for
her,
and
again
when
they
killed
her
father.
If
she
was
a
real
water
dancer,
she
would
go
out
there
with
Needle
and
kill
all
of
them,
and
never
run
from
anyone
ever
again.

“You’ll
have
no
one,”
Yoren
said
stubbornly.
“There’s
laws
on
such
things.”

The
gold
cloak
drew
a
shortsword.
“Here’s
your
law.”

Yoren
looked
at
the
blade.
“That’s
no
law,
just
a
sword.
Happens
I
got
one
too.”

The
officer
smiled.
“Old
fool.
I
have
five
men
with
me.”

Yoren
spat.
“Happens
I
got
thirty.”

The
gold
cloak
laughed.
“This
lot?”
said
a
big
lout
with
a
broken
nose.
“Who’s
first?”
he
shouted,
showing
his
steel.

Tarber
plucked
a
pitchfork
out
of
a
bale
of
hay.
“I
am.”

“No,
I
am,”
called
Cutjack,
the
plump
stonemason,
pulling
his
hammer
off
the
leather
apron
he
always
wore.

“Me.”
Kurz
came
up
off
the
ground
with
his
skinning
knife
in
hand.

“Me
and
him.”
Koss
strung
his
longbow.

“All
of
us,”
said
Reysen,
snatching
up
the
tall
hardwood
walking
staff
he
carried.

Dobber
stepped
naked
out
of
the
bathhouse
with
his
clothes
in
a
bundle,
saw
what
was
happening,
and
dropped
everything
but
his
dagger.
“Is
it
a
fight?”
he
asked.

“I
guess,”
said
Hot
Pie,
scrambling
on
all
fours
for
a
big
rock
to
throw.
Arya
could
not
believe
what
she
was
seeing.
She
hated
Hot
Pie!
Why
would
he
risk
himself
for
her?

The
one
with
the
broken
nose
still
thought
it
was
funny.
“You
girls
put
away
them
rocks
and
sticks
before
you
get
spanked.
None
of
you
knows
what
end
of
a
sword
to
hold.”

“I
do!”
Arya
wouldn’t
let
them
die
for
her
like
Syrio.
She
wouldn’t!
Shoving
through
the
hedge
with
Needle
in
hand,
she
slid
into
a
water
dancer’s
stance.

Broken
Nose
guffawed.
The
officer
looked
her
up
and
down.
“Put
the
blade
away,
little
girl,
no
one
wants
to
hurt
you.”

“I’m
not
a
girl!”
she
yelled,
furious.
What
was
wrong
with
them?
They
rode
all
this
way
for
her
and
here
she
was
and
they
were
just
smiling
at
her.
“I’m
the
one
you
want.”

“He’s
the
one
we
want.”
The
officer
jabbed
his
shortsword
toward
the
Bull,
who’d
come
forward
to
stand
beside
her,
Praed’s
cheap
steel
in
his
hand.

But
it
was
a
mistake
to
take
his
eyes
off
Yoren,
even
for
an
instant.
Quick
as
that,
the
black
brother’s
sword
was
pressed
to
the
apple
of
the
officer’s
throat.
“Neither’s
the
one
you
get,
less
you
want
me
to
see
if
your
apple’s
ripe
yet.
I
got
me
ten,
fifteen
more
brothers
in
that
inn,
if
you
still
need
convincing.
I
was
you,
I’d
let
loose
of
that
gutcutter,
spread
my
cheeks
over
that
fat
little
horse,
and
gallop
on
back
to
the
city.”
He
spat,
and
poked
harder
with
the
point
of
his
sword.
“Now.”

The
officer’s
fingers
uncurled.
His
sword
fell
in
the
dust.

“We’ll
just
keep
that,”
Yoren
said.
“Good
steel’s
always
needed
on
the
Wall.”

“As
you
say.
For
now.
Men.”
The
gold
cloaks
sheathed
and
mounted
up.
“You’d
best
scamper
up
to
that
Wall
of
yours
in
a
hurry,
old
man.
The
next
time
I
catch
you,
I
believe
I’ll
have
your
head
to
go
with
the
bastard
boy’s.”

“Better
men
than
you
have
tried.”
Yoren
slapped
the
rump
of
the
officer’s
horse
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
sent
him
reeling
off
down
the
kingsroad.
His
men
followed.

When
they
were
out
of
sight,
Hot
Pie
began
to
whoop,
but
Yoren
looked
angrier
than
ever.
“Fool!
You
think
he’s
done
with
us?
Next
time
he
won’t
prance
up
and
hand
me
no
damn
ribbon.
Get
the
rest
out
o’
them
baths,
we
need
to
be
moving.
Ride
all
night,
maybe
we
can
stay
ahead
o’
them
for
a
bit.”
He
scooped
up
the
shortsword
the
officer
had
dropped.
“Who
wants
this?”

“Me!”
Hot
Pie
yelled.

“Don’t
be
using
it
on
Arry.”
He
handed
the
boy
the
sword,
hilt
first,
and
walked
over
to
Arya,
but
it
was
the
Bull
he
spoke
to.
“Queen
wants
you
bad,
boy.”

Arya
was
lost.
“Why
should
she
want
him?”

The
Bull
scowled
at
her.
“Why
should
she
want
you?
You’re
nothing
but
a
little
gutter
rat!”

“Well,
you’re
nothing
but
a
bastard
boy!”
Or
maybe
he
was
only
pretending
to
be
a
bastard
boy.
“What’s
your
true
name?”

“Gendry,”
he
said,
like
he
wasn’t
quite
sure.

“Don’t
see
why
no
one
wants
neither
o’
you,”
Yoren
said,
“but
they
can’t
have
you
regardless.
You
ride
them
two
coursers.
First
sight
of
a
gold
cloak,
make
for
the
Wall
like
a
dragon’s
on
your
tail.
The
rest
o’
us
don’t
mean
spit
to
them.”

“Except
for
you,”
Arya
pointed
out.
“That
man
said
he’d
take
your
head
too.”

“Well,
as
to
that,”
Yoren
said,
“if
he
can
get
it
off
my
shoulders,
he’s
welcome
to
it.”





JON

“Sam?”
Jon
called
softly.

The
air
smelled
of
paper
and
dust
and
years.
Before
him,
tall
wooden
shelves
rose
up
into
dimness,
crammed
with
leatherbound
books
and
bins
of
ancient
scrolls.
A
faint
yellow
glow
filtered
through
the
stacks
from
some
hidden
lamp.
Jon
blew
out
the
taper
he
carried,
preferring
not
to
risk
an
open
flame
amidst
so
much
old
dry
paper.
Instead
he
followed
the
light,
wending
his
way
down
the
narrow
aisles
beneath
barrel-vaulted
ceilings.
All
in
black,
he
was
a
shadow
among
shadows,
dark
of
hair,
long
of
face,
grey
of
eye.
Black
moleskin
gloves
covered
his
hands;
the
right
because
it
was
burned,
the
left
because
a
man
felt
half
a
fool
wearing
only
one
glove.

Samwell
Tarly
sat
hunched
over
a
table
in
a
niche
carved
into
the
stone
of
the
wall.
The
glow
came
from
the
lamp
hung
over
his
head.
He
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
Jon’s
steps.

“Have
you
been
here
all
night?”

“Have
I?”
Sam
looked
startled.

“You
didn’t
break
your
fast
with
us,
and
your
bed
hadn’t
been
slept
in.”
Rast
suggested
that
maybe
Sam
had
deserted,
but
Jon
never
believed
it.
Desertion
required
its
own
sort
of
courage,
and
Sam
had
little
enough
of
that.

“Is
it
morning?
Down
here
there’s
no
way
to
know.”

“Sam,
you’re
a
sweet
fool,”
Jon
said.
“You’ll
miss
that
bed
when
we’re
sleeping
on
the
cold
hard
ground,
I
promise
you.”

Sam
yawned.
“Maester
Aemon
sent
me
to
find
maps
for
the
Lord
Commander.
I
never
thought…
Jon,
the
books,
have
you
ever
seen
their
like?
There
are
thousands!”

He
gazed
about
him.
“The
library
at
Winterfell
has
more
than
a
hundred.
Did
you
find
the
maps?”

“Oh,
yes.”
Sam’s
hand
swept
over
the
table,
fingers
plump
as
sausages
indicating
the
clutter
of
books
and
scrolls
before
him.
“A
dozen,
at
the
least.”
He
unfolded
a
square
of
parchment.
“The
paint
has
faded,
but
you
can
see
where
the
mapmaker
marked
the
sites
of
wildling
villages,
and
there’s
another
book…
where
is
it
now?
I
was
reading
it
a
moment
ago.”
He
shoved
some
scrolls
aside
to
reveal
a
dusty
volume
bound
in
rotted
leather.
“This,”
he
said
reverently,
“is
the
account
of
a
journey
from
the
Shadow
Tower
all
the
way
to
Lorn
Point
on
the
Frozen
Shore,
written
by
a
ranger
named
Redwyn.
It’s
not
dated,
but
he
mentions
a
Dorren
Stark
as
King
in
the
North,
so
it
must
be
from
before
the
Conquest.
Jon,
they
fought
giants!
Redwyn
even
traded
with
the
children
of
the
forest,
it’s
all
here.”
Ever
so
delicately,
he
turned
pages
with
a
finger.
“He
drew
maps
as
well,
see…”

“Maybe
you
could
write
an
account
of
our
ranging,
Sam.”

He’d
meant
to
sound
encouraging,
but
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say.
The
last
thing
Sam
needed
was
to
be
reminded
of
what
faced
them
on
the
morrow.
He
shuffled
the
scrolls
about
aimlessly.
“There’s
more
maps.
If
I
had
time
to
search…
everything’s
a
jumble.
I
could
set
it
all
to
order,
though;
I
know
I
could,
but
it
would
take
time…
well,
years,
in
truth.”

“Mormont
wanted
those
maps
a
little
sooner
than
that.”
Jon
plucked
a
scroll
from
a
bin,
blew
off
the
worst
of
the
dust.
A
corner
flaked
off
between
his
fingers
as
he
unrolled
it.
“Look,
this
one
is
crumbling,”
he
said,
frowning
over
the
faded
script.

“Be
gentle.”
Sam
came
around
the
table
and
took
the
scroll
from
his
hand,
holding
it
as
if
it
were
a
wounded
animal.
“The
important
books
used
to
be
copied
over
when
they
needed
them.
Some
of
the
oldest
have
been
copied
half
a
hundred
times,
probably.”

“Well,
don’t
bother
copying
that
one.
Twenty-three
barrels
of
pickled
cod,
eighteen
jars
of
fish
oil,
a
cask
of
salt…”

“An
inventory,”
Sam
said,
“or
perhaps
a
bill
of
sale.”

“Who
cares
how
much
pickled
cod
they
ate
six
hundred
years
ago?”
Jon
wondered.

“I
would.”
Sam
carefully
replaced
the
scroll
in
the
bin
from
which
Jon
had
plucked
it.
“You
can
learn
so
much
from
ledgers
like
that,
truly
you
can.
it
can
tell
you
how
many
men
were
in
the
Night’s
Watch
then,
how
they
lived,
what
they
ate…”

“They
ate
food,”
said
Jon,
“and
they
lived
as
we
live.”

“You’d
be
surprised.
This
vault
is
a
treasure,
Jon.”

“If
you
say
so.”
Jon
was
doubtful.
Treasure
meant
gold,
silver,
and
jewels,
not
dust,
spiders,
and
rotting
leather.

“I
do,”
the
fat
boy
blurted.
He
was
older
than
Jon,
a
man
grown
by
law,
but
it
was
hard
to
think
of
him
as
anything
but
a
boy.
“I
found
drawings
of
the
faces
in
the
trees,
and
a
book
about
the
tongue
of
the
children
of
the
forest…
works
that
even
the
Citadel
doesn’t
have,
scrolls
from
old
Valyria,
counts
of
the
seasons
written
by
maesters
dead
a
thousand
years…”

“The
books
will
still
be
here
when
we
return.”

“If
we
return…”

“The
Old
Bear
is
taking
two
hundred
seasoned
men,
three-quarters
of
them
rangers.
Qhorin
Halfhand
will
be
bringing
another
hundred
brothers
from
the
Shadow
Tower.
You’ll
be
as
safe
as
if
you
were
back
in
your
lord
father’s
castle
at
Horn
Hill.”

Samwell
Tarly
managed
a
sad
little
smile.
“I
was
never
very
safe
in
my
father’s
castle
either.”

The
gods
play
cruel
jests,
Jon
thought.
Pyp
and
Toad,
all
a
lather
to
be
a
part
of
the
great
ranging,
were
to
remain
at
Castle
Black.
It
was
Samwell
Tarly,
the
self-proclaimed
coward,
grossly
fat,
timid,
and
near
as
bad
a
rider
as
he
was
with
a
sword,
who
must
face
the
haunted
forest.
The
Old
Bear
was
taking
two
cages
of
ravens,
so
they
might
send
back
word
as
they
went.
Maester
Aemon
was
blind
and
far
too
frail
to
ride
with
them,
so
his
steward
must
go
in
his
place.
“We
need
you
for
the
ravens,
Sam.
And
someone
has
to
help
me
keep
Grenn
humble.”

Sam’s
chins
quivered.
“You
could
care
for
the
ravens,
or
Grenn
could,
or
anyone,”
he
said
with
a
thin
edge
of
desperation
in
his
voice.
“I
could
show
you
how.
You
know
your
letters
too,
you
could
write
down
Lord
Mormont’s
messages
as
well
as
I.”

“I’m
the
Old
Bear’s
steward.
I’ll
need
to
squire
for
him,
tend
his
horse,
set
up
his
tent;
I
won’t
have
time
to
watch
over
birds
as
well.
Sam,
you
said
the
words.
You’re
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
now.”

“A
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
shouldn’t
be
so
scared.”

“We’re
all
scared.
We’d
be
fools
if
we
weren’t.”
Too
many
rangers
had
been
lost
the
past
two
years,
even
Benjen
Stark,
Jon’s
uncle.
They
had
found
two
of
his
uncle’s
men
in
the
wood,
slain,
but
the
corpses
had
risen
in
the
chill
of
night.
Jon’s
burnt
fingers
twitched
as
he
remembered.
He
still
saw
the
wight
in
his
dreams,
dead
Othor
with
the
burning
blue
eyes
and
the
cold
black
hands,
but
that
was
the
last
thing
Sam
needed
to
be
reminded
of.
“There’s
no
shame
in
fear,
my
father
told
me,
what
matters
is
how
we
face
it.
Come,
I’ll
help
you
gather
up
the
maps.”

Sam
nodded
unhappily.
The
shelves
were
so
closely
spaced
that
they
had
to
walk
single
file
as
they
left.
The
vault
opened
onto
one
of
the
tunnels
the
brothers
called
the
wormwalks,
winding
subterranean
passages
that
linked
the
keeps
and
towers
of
Castle
Black
under
the
earth.
In
summer
the
wormwalks
were
seldom
used,
save
by
rats
and
other
vermin,
but
winter
was
a
different
matter.
When
the
snows
drifted
forty
and
fifty
feet
high
and
the
ice
winds
came
howling
out
of
the
north,
the
tunnels
were
all
that
held
Castle
Black
together.

Soon,
Jon
thought
as
they
climbed.
He’d
seen
the
harbinger
that
had
come
to
Maester
Aemon
with
word
of
summer’s
end,
the
great
raven
of
the
Citadel,
white
and
silent
as
Ghost.
He
had
seen
a
winter
once,
when
he
was
very
young,
but
everyone
agreed
that
it
had
been
a
short
one,
and
mild.
This
one
would
be
different.
He
could
feel
it
in
his
bones.

The
steep
stone
steps
had
Sam
puffing
like
a
blacksmith’s
bellows
by
the
time
they
reached
the
surface.
They
emerged
into
a
brisk
wind
that
made
Jon’s
cloak
swirl
and
snap.
Ghost
was
stretched
out
asleep
beneath
the
wattle-and-daub
wall
of
the
granary,
but
he
woke
when
Jon
appeared,
bushy
white
tail
held
stiffly
upright
as
he
trotted
to
them.

Sam
squinted
up
at
the
Wall.
It
loomed
above
them,
an
icy
cliff
seven
hundred
feet
high.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
Jon
almost
a
living
thing,
with
moods
of
its
own.
The
color
of
the
ice
was
wont
to
change
with
every
shift
of
the
light.
Now
it
was
the
deep
blue
of
frozen
rivers,
now
the
dirty
white
of
old
snow,
and
when
a
cloud
passed
before
the
sun
it
darkened
to
the
pale
grey
of
pitted
stone.
The
Wall
stretched
east
and
west
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see,
so
huge
that
it
shrunk
the
timbered
keeps
and
stone
towers
of
the
castle
to
insignificance.
It
was
the
end
of
the
world.

And
we
are
going
beyond
it.

The
morning
sky
was
streaked
by
thin
grey
clouds,
but
the
pale
red
line
was
there
behind
them.
The
black
brothers
had
dubbed
the
wanderer
Mormont’s
Torch,
saying
(only
half
in
jest)
that
the
gods
must
have
sent
it
to
light
the
old
man’s
way
through
the
haunted
forest.

“The
comet’s
so
bright
you
can
see
it
by
day
now,”
Sam
said,
shading
his
eyes
with
a
fistful
of
books.

“Never
mind
about
comets,
it’s
maps
the
Old
Bear
wants.”

Ghost
loped
ahead
of
them.
The
grounds
seemed
deserted
this
morning,
with
so
many
rangers
off
at
the
brothel
in
Mole’s
Town,
digging
for
buried
treasure
and
drinking
themselves
blind.
Grenn
had
gone
with
them.
Pyp
and
Halder
and
Toad
had
offered
to
buy
him
his
first
woman
to
celebrate
his
first
ranging.
They’d
wanted
Jon
and
Sam
to
come
as
well,
but
Sam
was
almost
as
frightened
of
whores
as
he
was
of
the
haunted
forest,
and
Jon
had
wanted
no
part
of
it.
“Do
what
you
want,”
he
told
Toad,
“I
took
a
vow.”

As
they
passed
the
sept,
he
heard
voices
raised
in
song.
Some
men
want
whores
on
the
eve
of
battle,
and
some
want
gods.
Jon
wondered
who
felt
better
afterward.
The
sept
tempted
him
no
more
than
the
brothel;
his
own
gods
kept
their
temples
in
the
wild
places,
where
the
weirwoods
spread
their
bone-white
branches.
The
Seven
have
no
power
beyond
the
Wall,
he
thought,
but
my
gods
will
be
waiting.

Outside
the
armory,
Ser
Endrew
Tarth
was
working
with
some
raw
recruits.
They’d
come
in
last
night
with
Conwy,
one
of
the
wandering
crows
who
roamed
the
Seven
Kingdoms
collecting
men
for
the
Wall.
This
new
crop
consisted
of
a
greybeard
leaning
on
a
staff,
two
blond
boys
with
the
look
of
brothers,
a
foppish
youth
in
soiled
satin,
a
raggy
man
with
a
clubfoot,
and
some
grinning
loon
who
must
have
fancied
himself
a
warrior.
Ser
Endrew
was
showing
him
the
error
of
that
presumption.
He
was
a
gentler
master-at-arms
than
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
had
been,
but
his
lessons
would
still
raise
bruises.
Sam
winced
at
every
blow,
but
Jon
Snow
watched
the
swordplay
closely.

“What
do
you
make
of
them,
Snow?”
Donal
Noye
stood
in
the
door
of
his
armory,
bare-chested
under
a
leather
apron,
the
stump
of
his
left
arm
uncovered
for
once.
With
his
big
gut
and
barrel
chest,
his
flat
nose
and
bristly
black
jaw,
Noyc
did
not
make
a
pretty
sight,
but
he
was
a
welcome
one
nonetheless.
The
armorer
had
proved
himself
a
good
friend.

“They
smell
of
summer,”
Jon
said
as
Ser
Endrew
bullrushed
his
foe
and
knocked
him
sprawling.
“Where
did
Conwy
find
them?”

“A
lord’s
dungeon
near
Gulltown,”
the
smith
replied.
“A
brigand,
a
barber,
a
beggar,
two
orphans,
and
a
boy
whore.
With
such
do
we
defend
the
realms
of
men.”

“They’ll
do.”
Jon
gave
Sam
a
private
smile.
“We
did.”

Noye
drew
him
closer.
“You’ve
heard
these
tidings
of
your
brother?”

“Last
night.”
Conwy
and
his
charges
had
brought
the
news
north
with
them,
and
the
talk
in
the
common
room
had
been
of
little
else.
Jon
was
still
not
certain
how
he
felt
about
it.
Robb
a
king?
The
brother
he’d
played
with,
fought
with,
shared
his
first
cup
of
wine
with?
But
not
mother’s
milk,
no.
So
now
Robb
will
sip
summerwine
from
jeweled
goblets,
while
I’m
kneeling
beside
some
stream
sucking
snowmelt
from
cupped
hands.
“Robb
will
make
a
good
king,”
he
said
loyally.

“Will
he
now?”
The
smith
eyed
him
frankly.
“I
hope
that’s
so,
boy,
but
once
I
might
have
said
the
same
of
Robert.”

“They
say
you
forged
his
warhammer,”
Jon
remembered.

“Aye.
I
was
his
man,
a
Baratheon
man,
smith
and
armorer
at
Storm’s
End
until
I
lost
the
arm.
I’m
old
enough
to
remember
Lord
Steffon
before
the
sea
took
him,
and
I
knew
those
three
sons
of
his
since
they
got
their
names.
I
tell
you
this—Robert
was
never
the
same
after
he
put
on
that
crown.
Some
men
are
like
swords,
made
for
fighting.
Hang
them
up
and
they
go
to
rust.”

“And
his
brothers?”
Jon
asked.

The
armorer
considered
that
a
moment.
“Robert
was
the
true
steel.
Stannis
is
pure
iron,
black
and
hard
and
strong,
yes,
but
brittle,
the
way
iron
gets.
He’ll
break
before
he
bends.
And
Renly,
that
one,
he’s
copper,
bright
and
shiny,
pretty
to
look
at
but
not
worth
all
that
much
at
the
end
of
the
day.”

And
what
metal
is
Robb?
Jon
did
not
ask.
Noye
was
a
Baratheon
man;
likely
he
thought
Joffrey
the
lawful
king
and
Robb
a
traitor.
Among
the
brotherhood
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
there
was
an
unspoken
pact
never
to
probe
too
deeply
into
such
matters.
Men
came
to
the
Wall
from
all
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
old
loves
and
loyalties
were
not
easily
forgotten,
no
matter
how
many
oaths
a
man
swore…
as
Jon
himself
had
good
reason
to
know.
Even
Sam—his
father’s
House
was
sworn
to
Highgarden,
whose
Lord
Tyrell
supported
King
Renly.
Best
not
to
talk
of
such
things.
The
Night’s
Watch
took
no
sides.
“Lord
Mormont
awaits
us,”
Jon
said.

“I
won’t
keep
you
from
the
Old
Bear.”
Noye
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
smiled.
“May
the
gods
go
with
you
on
the
morrow,
Snow.
You
bring
back
that
uncle
of
yours,
you
hear?”

“We
will,”
Jon
promised
him.

Lord
Commander
Mormont
had
taken
up
residence
in
the
King’s
Tower
after
the
fire
had
gutted
his
own.
Jon
left
Ghost
with
the
guards
outside
the
door.
“More
stairs,”
said
Sam
miserably
as
they
started
up.
“I
hate
stairs.”

“Well,
that’s
one
thing
we
won’t
face
in
the
wood.”

When
they
entered
the
solar,
the
raven
spied
them
at
once.
“Snow!”
the
bird
shrieked.
Mormont
broke
off
his
conversation.
“Took
you
long
enough
with
those
maps.”
He
pushed
the
remains
of
breakfast
out
of
the
way
to
make
room
on
the
table.
“Put
them
here.
I’ll
have
a
look
at
them
later.”

Thoren
Smallwood,
a
sinewy
ranger
with
a
weak
chin
and
a
weaker
mouth
hidden
under
a
thin
scraggle
of
beard,
gave
Jon
and
Sam
a
cool
look.
He
had
been
one
of
Alliser
Thorne’s
henchmen,
and
had
no
love
for
either
of
them.
“The
Lord
Commander’s
place
is
at
Castle
Black,
lording
and
commanding,”
he
told
Mormont,
ignoring
the
newcomers,
“it
seems
to
me.”

The
raven
flapped
big
black
wings.
“Me,
me,
me.”

“If
you
are
ever
Lord
Commander,
you
may
do
as
you
please,”
Mormont
told
the
ranger,
“but
it
seems
to
me
that
I
have
not
died
yet,
nor
have
the
brothers
put
you
in
my
place.”

“I’m
First
Ranger
now,
with
Ben
Stark
lost
and
Ser
Jaremy
killed,”
Smallwood
said
stubbornly.
“The
command
should
be
mine.”

Mormont
would
have
none
of
it.
“I
sent
out
Ben
Stark,
and
Ser
Waymar
before
him.
I
do
not
mean
to
send
you
after
them
and
sit
wondering
how
long
I
must
wait
before
I
give
you
up
for
lost
as
well.”
He
pointed.
“And
Stark
remains
First
Ranger
until
we
know
for
a
certainty
that
he
is
dead.
Should
that
day
come,
it
will
be
me
who
names
his
successor,
not
you.
Now
stop
wasting
my
time.
We
ride
at
first
light,
or
have
you
forgotten?”

Smallwood
pushed
to
his
feet.
“As
my
lord
commands.”
On
the
way
out,
he
frowned
at
Jon,
as
if
it
were
somehow
his
fault.

“First
Ranger!”
The
Old
Bear’s
eyes
lighted
on
Sam.
“I’d
sooner
name
you
First
Ranger.
He
has
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
I’m
too
old
to
ride
with
him.
Do
I
look
old
to
you,
boy?”
The
hair
that
had
retreated
from
Mormont’s
spotted
scalp
had
regrouped
beneath
his
chin
in
a
shaggy
grey
beard
that
covered
much
of
his
chest.
He
thumped
it
hard.
“Do
I
look
frail?”

Sam
opened
his
mouth,
gave
a
little
squeak.
The
Old
Bear
terrified
him.
“No,
my
lord,”
Jon
offered
quickly.
“You
look
strong
as
a…
a…”

“Don’t
cozen
me,
Snow,
you
know
I
won’t
have
it.
Let
me
have
a
look
at
these
maps.”
Mormont
pawed
through
them
brusquely,
giving
each
no
more
than
a
glance
and
a
grunt.
“Was
this
all
you
could
find?”

“I…
m-m-my
lord,”
Sam
stammered,
“there…
there
were
more,
b-b-but…
the
dis-disorder…”

“These
are
old,”
Mormont
complained,
and
his
raven
echoed
him
with
a
sharp
cry
of
“Old,
old.”

“The
villages
may
come
and
go,
but
the
hills
and
rivers
will
be
in
the
same
places,”
Jon
pointed
out.

“True
enough.
Have
you
chosen
your
ravens
yet,
Tarly?”

“M-m-maester
Aemon
m-means
to
p-pick
them
come
evenfall,
after
the
f-f-feeding.”

“I’ll
have
his
best.
Smart
birds,
and
strong.”

“Strong,”
his
own
bird
said,
preening.
“Strong,
strong.”

“If
it
happens
that
we’re
all
butchered
out
there,
I
mean
for
my
successor
to
know
where
and
how
we
died.”

Talk
of
butchery
reduced
Samwell
Tarly
to
speechlessness.
Mormont
leaned
forward.
“Tarly,
when
I
was
a
lad
half
your
age,
my
lady
mother
told
me
that
if
I
stood
about
with
my
mouth
open,
a
weasel
was
like
to
mistake
it
for
his
lair
and
run
down
my
throat.
If
you
have
something
to
say,
say
it.
Otherwise,
beware
of
weasels.”
He
waved
a
brusque
dismissal.
“Off
with
you,
I’m
too
busy
for
folly.
No
doubt
the
maester
has
some
work
you
can
do.”

Sam
swallowed,
stepped
back,
and
scurried
out
so
quickly
he
almost
tripped
over
the
rushes.

“Is
that
boy
as
big
a
fool
as
he
seems?”
the
Lord
Commander
asked
when
he’d
gone.
“Fool,”
the
raven
complained.
Mormont
did
not
wait
for
Jon
to
answer.
“His
lord
father
stands
high
in
King
Renly’s
councils,
and
I
had
half
a
notion
to
dispatch
him…
no,
best
not.
Renly
is
not
like
to
heed
a
quaking
fat
boy.
I’ll
send
Ser
Arnell.
He’s
a
deal
steadier,
and
his
mother
was
one
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways.”

“If
it
please
my
lord,
what
would
you
have
of
King
Renly?”

“The
same
things
I’d
have
of
all
of
them,
lad.
Men,
horses,
swords,
armor,
grain,
cheese,
wine,
wool,
nails…
the
Night’s
Watch
is
not
proud,
we
take
what
is
offered.”
His
fingers
drummed
against
the
roughhewn
planks
of
the
table.
“If
the
winds
have
been
kind,
Ser
Alliser
should
reach
King’s
Landing
by
the
turn
of
the
moon,
but
whether
this
boy
Joffrey
will
pay
him
any
heed,
I
do
not
know.
House
Lannister
has
never
been
a
friend
to
the
Watch.”

“Thorne
has
the
wight’s
hand
to
show
them.”
A
grisly
pale
thing
with
black
fingers,
it
was,
that
twitched
and
stirred
in
its
jar
as
if
it
were
still
alive.

“Would
that
we
had
another
hand
to
send
to
Renly.”

“Dywen
says
you
can
find
anything
beyond
the
Wall.”

“Aye,
Dywen
says.
And
the
last
time
he
went
ranging,
he
says
he
saw
a
bear
fifteen
feet
tall.”
Mormont
snorted.
“My
sister
is
said
to
have
taken
a
bear
for
her
lover.
I’d
believe
that
before
I’d
believe
one
fifteen
feet
tall.
Though
in
a
world
where
dead
come
walking…
ah,
even
so,
a
man
must
believe
his
eyes.
I
have
seen
the
dead
walk.
I’ve
not
seen
any
giant
bears.”
He
gave
Jon
a
long,
searching
look.
“But
we
were
speaking
of
hands.
How
is
yours?”

“Better.”
Jon
peeled
off
his
moleskin
glove
and
showed
him.
Scars
covered
his
arm
halfway
to
the
elbow,
and
the
mottled
pink
flesh
still
felt
tight
and
tender,
but
it
was
healing.
“It
itches,
though.
Maester
Aemon
says
that’s
good.
He
gave
me
a
salve
to
take
with
me
when
we
ride.”

“You
can
wield
Longclaw
despite
the
pain?”

“Well
enough.”
Jon
flexed
his
fingers,
opening
and
closing
his
fist
the
way
the
maester
had
shown
him.
“I’m
to
work
the
fingers
every
day
to
keep
them
nimble,
as
Maester
Aemon
said.”

“Blind
he
may
be,
but
Aemon
knows
what
he’s
about.
I
pray
the
gods
let
us
keep
him
another
twenty
years.
Do
you
know
that
he
might
have
been
king?”

Jon
was
taken
by
surprise.
“He
told
me
his
father
was
king,
but
not…
I
thought
him
perhaps
a
younger
son.”

“So
he
was.
His
father’s
father
was
Daeron
Targaryen,
the
Second
of
His
Name,
who
brought
Dorne
into
the
realm.
Part
of
the
pact
was
that
he
wed
a
Dornish
princess.
She
gave
him
four
sons.
Aemon’s
father
Maekar
was
the
youngest
of
those,
and
Aemon
was
his
third
son.
Mind
you,
all
this
happened
long
before
I
was
born,
ancient
as
Smallwood
would
make
me.”

“Maester
Aemon
was
named
for
the
Dragonknight.”

“So
he
was.
Some
say
Prince
Aemon
was
King
Daeron’s
true
father,
not
Aegon
the
Unworthy.
Be
that
as
it
may,
our
Aemon
lacked
the
Dragonknight’s
martial
nature.
He
likes
to
say
he
had
a
slow
sword
but
quick
wits.
Small
wonder
his
grandfather
packed
him
off
to
the
Citadel.
He
was
nine
or
ten,
I
believe…
and
ninth
or
tenth
in
the
line
of
succession
as
well.”

Maester
Aemon
had
counted
more
than
a
hundred
name
days,
Jon
knew.
Frail,
shrunken,
wizened,
and
blind,
it
was
hard
to
imagine
him
as
a
little
boy
no
older
than
Arya.

Mormont
continued.
“Aemon
was
at
his
books
when
the
eldest
of
his
uncles,
the
heir
apparent,
was
slain
in
a
tourney
mishap.
He
left
two
sons,
but
they
followed
him
to
the
grave
not
long
after,
during
the
Great
Spring
Sickness.
King
Daeron
was
also
taken,
so
the
crown
passed
to
Daeron’s
second
son,
Aerys.”

“The
Mad
King?”
Jon
was
confused.
Aerys
had
been
king
before
Robert,
that
wasn’t
so
long
ago.

“No,
this
was
Aerys
the
First.
The
one
Robert
deposed
was
the
second
of
that
name.”

“How
long
ago
was
this?”

“Eighty
years
or
close
enough,”
the
Old
Bear
said,
“and
no,
I
still
hadn’t
been
born,
though
Aemon
had
forged
half
a
dozen
links
of
his
maester’s
chain
by
then.
Aerys
wed
his
own
sister,
as
the
Targaryens
were
wont
to
do,
and
reigned
for
ten
or
twelve
years.
Aemon
took
his
vows
and
left
the
Citadel
to
serve
at
some
lordling’s
court…
until
his
royal
uncle
died
without
issue.
The
Iron
Throne
passed
to
the
last
of
King
Daeron’s
four
sons.
That
was
Maekar,
Aemon’s
father.
The
new
king
summoned
all
his
sons
to
court
and
would
have
made
Aemon
part
of
his
councils,
but
he
refused,
saying
that
would
usurp
the
place
rightly
belonging
to
the
Grand
Maester.
Instead
he
served
at
the
keep
of
his
eldest
brother,
another
Daeron.
Well,
that
one
died
too,
leaving
only
a
feeble-witted
daughter
as
heir.
Some
pox
he
caught
from
a
whore,
I
believe.
The
next
brother
was
Aerion.”

“Aerion
the
Monstrous?”
Jon
knew
that
name.
“The
Prince
Who
Thought
He
Was
a
Dragon”
was
one
of
Old
Nan’s
more
gruesome
tales.
His
little
brother
Bran
had
loved
it.

“The
very
one,
though
he
named
himself
Aerion
Brightflame.
One
night,
in
his
cups,
he
drank
a
jar
of
wildfire,
after
telling
his
friends
it
would
transform
him
into
a
dragon,
but
the
gods
were
kind
and
it
transformed
him
into
a
corpse.
Not
quite
a
year
after,
King
Maekar
died
in
battle
against
an
outlaw
lord.”

Jon
was
not
entirely
innocent
of
the
history
of
the
realm;
his
own
maester
had
seen
to
that.
“That
was
the
year
of
the
Great
Council,”
he
said.
“The
lords
passed
over
Prince
Aerion’s
infant
son
and
Prince
Daeron’s
daughter
and
gave
the
crown
to
Aegon.”

“Yes
and
no.
First
they
offered
it,
quietly,
to
Aemon.
And
quietly
he
refused.
The
gods
meant
for
him
to
serve,
not
to
rule,
he
told
them.
He
had
sworn
a
vow
and
would
not
break
it,
though
the
High
Septon
himself
offered
to
absolve
him.
Well,
no
sane
man
wanted
any
blood
of
Aerion’s
on
the
throne,
and
Daeron’s
girl
was
a
lackwit
besides
being
female,
so
they
had
no
choice
but
to
turn
to
Aemon’s
younger
brother—Aegon,
the
Fifth
of
His
Name.
Aegon
the
Unlikely,
they
called
him,
born
the
fourth
son
of
a
fourth
son.
Aemon
knew,
and
rightly,
that
if
he
remained
at
court
those
who
disliked
his
brother’s
rule
would
seek
to
use
him,
so
he
came
to
the
Wall.
And
here
he
has
remained,
while
his
brother
and
his
brother’s
son
and
his
son
each
reigned
and
died
in
turn,
until
Jaime
Lannister
put
an
end
to
the
line
of
the
Dragonkings.”

“King,”
croaked
the
raven.
The
bird
flapped
across
the
solar
to
land
on
Mormont’s
shoulder.
“King,”
it
said
again,
strutting
back
and
forth.

“He
likes
that
word,”
Jon
said,
smiling.

“An
easy
word
to
say.
An
easy
word
to
like.”

“King,”
the
bird
said
again.

“I
think
he
means
for
you
to
have
a
crown,
my
lord.”

“The
realm
has
three
kings
already,
and
that’s
two
too
many
for
my
liking.”
Mormont
stroked
the
raven
under
the
beak
with
a
finger,
but
all
the
while
his
eyes
never
left
Jon
Snow.

It
made
him
feel
odd.
“My
lord,
why
have
you
told
me
this,
about
Maester
Aemon?”

“Must
I
have
a
reason?”
Mormont
shifted
in
his
seat,
frowning.
“Your
brother
Robb
has
been
crowned
King
in
the
North.
You
and
Aemon
have
that
in
common.
A
king
for
a
brother.”

“And
this
too,”
said
Jon.
“A
vow.”

The
Old
Bear
gave
a
loud
snort,
and
the
raven
took
flight,
flapping
in
a
circle
about
the
room,
“Give
me
a
man
for
every
vow
I’ve
seen
broken
and
the
Wall
will
never
lack
for
defenders.”

“I’ve
always
known
that
Robb
would
be
Lord
of
Winterfell.”

Mormont
gave
a
whistle,
and
the
bird
flew
to
him
again
and
settled
on
his
arm.
“A
lord’s
one
thing,
a
king’s
another.”
He
offered
the
raven
a
handful
of
corn
from
his
pocket.
“They
will
garb
your
brother
Robb
in
silks,
satins,
and
velvets
of
a
hundred
different
colors,
while
you
live
and
die
in
black
ringmail.
He
will
wed
some
beautiful
princess
and
father
sons
on
her.
You’ll
have
no
wife,
nor
will
you
ever
hold
a
child
of
your
own
blood
in
your
arms.
Robb
will
rule,
you
will
serve.
Men
will
call
you
a
crow.
Him
they’ll
call
Your
Grace.
Singers
will
praise
every
little
thing
he
does,
while
your
greatest
deeds
all
go
unsung.
Tell
me
that
none
of
this
troubles
you,
Jon…
and
I’ll
name
you
a
liar,
and
know
I
have
the
truth
of
it.”

Jon
drew
himself
up,
taut
as
a
bowstring.
“And
if
it
did
trouble
me,
what
might
I
do,
bastard
as
I
am?”

“What
will
you
do?”
Mormont
asked.
“Bastard
as
you
are?”

“Be
troubled,”
said
Jon,
“and
keep
my
vows.”





CATELYN

Her
son’s
crown
was
fresh
from
the
forge,
and
it
seemed
to
Catelyn
Stark
that
the
weight
of
it
pressed
heavy
on
Robb’s
head.

The
ancient
crown
of
the
Kings
of
Winter
had
been
lost
three
centuries
ago,
yielded
up
to
Aegon
the
Conqueror
when
Torrhen
Stark
knelt
in
submission.
What
Aegon
had
done
with
it
no
man
could
say.
Lord
Hoster’s
smith
had
done
his
work
well,
and
Robb’s
crown
looked
much
as
the
other
was
said
to
have
looked
in
the
tales
told
of
the
Stark
kings
of
old;
an
open
circlet
of
hammered
bronze
incised
with
the
runes
of
the
First
Men,
surmounted
by
nine
black
iron
spikes
wrought
in
the
shape
of
longswords.
Of
gold
and
silver
and
gemstones,
it
had
none;
bronze
and
iron
were
the
metals
of
winter,
dark
and
strong
to
fight
against
the
cold.

As
they
waited
in
Riverrun’s
Great
Hall
for
the
prisoner
to
be
brought
before
them,
she
saw
Robb
push
back
the
crown
so
it
rested
upon
the
thick
auburn
mop
of
his
hair;
moments
later,
he
moved
it
forward
again;
later
he
gave
it
a
quarter
turn,
as
if
that
might
make
it
sit
more
easily
on
his
brow.
It
is
no
easy
thing
to
wear
a
crown,
Catelyn
thought,
watching,
especially
for
a
boy
of
fifteen
years.

When
the
guards
brought
in
the
captive,
Robb
called
for
his
sword.
Olyvar
Frey
offered
it
up
hilt
first,
and
her
son
drew
the
blade
and
laid
it
bare
across
his
knees,
a
threat
plain
for
all
to
see.
“Your
Grace,
here
is
the
man
you
asked
for,”
announced
Ser
Robin
Ryger,
captain
of
the
Tully
household
guard.

“Kneel
before
the
king,
Lannister!”
Theon
Greyjoy
shouted.
Ser
Robin
forced
the
prisoner
to
his
knees.

He
did
not
look
a
lion,
Catelyn
reflected.
This
Ser
Cleos
Frey
was
a
son
of
the
Lady
Genna
who
was
sister
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
but
he
had
none
of
the
fabled
Lannister
beauty,
the
fair
hair
and
green
eyes.
Instead
he
had
inherited
the
stringy
brown
locks,
weak
chin,
and
thin
face
of
his
sire,
Ser
Emmon
Frey,
old
Lord
Walder’s
second
son.
His
eyes
were
pale
and
watery
and
he
could
not
seem
to
stop
blinking,
but
perhaps
that
was
only
the
light.
The
cells
below
Riverrun
were
dark
and
damp…
and
these
days
crowded
as
well.

“Rise,
Ser
Cleos.”
Her
son’s
voice
was
not
as
icy
as
his
father’s
would
have
been,
but
he
did
not
sound
a
boy
of
fifteen
either.
War
had
made
a
man
of
him
before
his
time.
Morning
light
glimmered
faintly
against
the
edge
of
the
steel
across
his
knees.

Yet
it
was
not
the
sword
that
made
Ser
Cleos
Frey
anxious;
it
was
the
beast.
Grey
Wind,
her
son
had
named
him.
A
direwolf
large
as
any
elkhound,
lean
and
smoke-dark,
with
eyes
like
molten
gold.
When
the
beast
padded
forward
and
sniffed
at
the
captive
knight,
every
man
in
that
hall
could
smell
the
scent
of
fear.
Ser
Cleos
had
been
taken
during
the
battle
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
where
Grey
Wind
had
ripped
out
the
throats
of
half
a
dozen
men.

The
knight
scrambled
up,
edging
away
with
such
alacrity
that
some
of
the
watchers
laughed
aloud.
“Thank
you,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
barked
Lord
Umber,
the
Greatjon,
ever
the
loudest
of
Robb’s
northern
bannermen…
and
the
truest
and
fiercest
as
well,
or
so
he
insisted.
He
had
been
the
first
to
proclaim
her
son
King
in
the
North,
and
he
would
brook
no
slight
to
the
honor
of
his
new-made
sovereign.

“Your
Grace,”
Ser
Cleos
corrected
hastily.
“Pardons.”

He
is
not
a
bold
man,
this
one,
Catelyn
thought.
More
of
a
Frey
than
a
Lannister,
in
truth.
His
cousin
the
Kingslayer
would
have
been
a
much
different
matter.
They
would
never
have
gotten
that
honorific
through
Ser
Jaime
Lannister’s
perfect
teeth.

“I
brought
you
from
your
cell
to
carry
my
message
to
your
cousin
Cersei
Lannister
in
King’s
Landing.
You’ll
travel
under
a
peace
banner,
with
thirty
of
my
best
men
to
escort
you.”

Ser
Cleos
was
visibly
relieved.
“Then
I
should
be
most
glad
to
bring
His
Grace’s
message
to
the
queen.”

“Understand,”
Robb
said,
“I
am
not
giving
you
your
freedom.
Your
grandfather
Lord
Walder
pledged
me
his
support
and
that
of
House
Frey.
Many
of
your
cousins
and
uncles
rode
with
us
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
but
you
chose
to
fight
beneath
the
lion
banner.
That
makes
you
a
Lannister,
not
a
Frey.
I
want
your
pledge,
on
your
honor
as
a
knight,
that
after
you
deliver
my
message
you’ll
return
with
the
queen’s
reply,
and
resume
your
captivity.”

Ser
Cleos
answered
at
once.
“I
do
so
vow.”

“Every
man
in
this
hall
has
heard
you,”
warned
Catelyn’s
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
who
spoke
for
Riverrun
and
the
lords
of
the
Trident
in
the
place
of
their
dying
father.
“If
you
do
not
return,
the
whole
realm
will
know
you
forsworn.”

“I
will
do
as
I
pledged,”
Ser
Cleos
replied
stiffly.
“What
is
this
message?
“

“An
offer
of
peace.”
Robb
stood,
longsword
in
hand.
Grey
Wind
moved
to
his
side.
The
hall
grew
hushed.
“Tell
the
Queen
Regent
that
if
she
meets
my
terms,
I
will
sheath
this
sword,
and
make
an
end
to
the
war
between
us.”

In
the
back
of
the
hall,
Catelyn
glimpsed
the
tall,
gaunt
figure
of
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
shove
through
a
rank
of
guards
and
out
the
door.
No
one
else
moved.
Robb
paid
the
disruption
no
mind.
“Olyvar,
the
paper,”
he
commanded.
The
squire
took
his
longsword
and
handed
up
a
rolled
parchment.

Robb
unrolled
it.
“First,
the
queen
must
release
my
sisters
and
provide
them
with
transport
by
sea
from
King’s
Landing
to
White
Harbor.
It
is
to
be
understood
that
Sansa’s
betrothal
to
Joffrey
Baratheon
is
at
an
end.
When
I
receive
word
from
my
castellan
that
my
sisters
have
returned
unharmed
to
Winterfell,
I
will
release
the
queen’s
cousins,
the
squire
Willem
Lannister
and
your
brother
Tion
Frey,
and
give
them
safe
escort
to
Casterly
Rock
or
wheresoever
she
desires
them
delivered.”

Catelyn
Stark
wished
she
could
read
the
thoughts
that
hid
behind
each
face,
each
furrowed
brow
and
pair
of
tightened
lips.

“Secondly,
my
lord
father’s
bones
will
be
returned
to
us,
so
he
may
rest
beside
his
brother
and
sister
in
the
crypts
beneath
Winterfell,
as
he
would
have
wished.
The
remains
of
the
men
of
his
household
guard
who
died
in
his
service
at
King’s
Landing
must
also
be
returned.”

Living
men
had
gone
south,
and
cold
bones
would
return.
Ned
had
the
truth
of
it,
she
thought.
His
place
was
at
Winterfell,
he
said
as
much,
but
would
I
hear
him?
No.
Go,
I
told
him,
you
must
be
Robert’s
Hand,
for
the
good
of
our
House,
for
the
sake
of
our
children…
my
doing,
mine,
no
other…

“Third,
my
father’s
greatsword
Ice
will
be
delivered
to
my
hand,
here
at
Riverrun.”

She
watched
her
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully
as
he
stood
with
his
thumbs
hooked
over
his
swordbelt,
his
face
as
still
as
stone.

“Fourth,
the
queen
will
command
her
father
Lord
Tywin
to
release
those
knights
and
lords
bannermen
of
mine
that
he
took
captive
in
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Once
he
does
so,
I
shall
release
my
own
captives
taken
in
the
Whispering
Wood
and
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
save
Jaime
Lannister
alone,
who
will
remain
my
hostage
for
his
father’s
good
behavior.”

She
studied
Theon
Greyjoy’s
sly
smile,
wondering
what
it
meant.
That
young
man
had
a
way
of
looking
as
though
he
knew
some
secret
jest
that
only
he
was
privy
to;
Catelyn
had
never
liked
it.

“Lastly,
King
Joffrey
and
the
Queen
Regent
must
renounce
all
claims
to
dominion
over
the
north.
Henceforth
we
are
no
part
of
their
realm,
but
a
free
and
independent
kingdom,
as
of
old.
Our
domain
shall
include
all
the
Stark
lands
north
of
the
Neck,
and
in
addition
the
lands
watered
by
the
River
Trident
and
its
vassal
streams,
bounded
by
the
Golden
Tooth
to
the
west
and
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
in
the
east.”

“THE
KING
IN
THE
NORTH!”
boomed
Greatjon
Umber,
a
ham-sized
fist
hammering
at
the
air
as
he
shouted.
“Stark!
Stark!
The
King
in
the
North!”

Robb
rolled
up
the
parchment
again.
“Maester
Vyman
has
drawn
a
map,
showing
the
borders
we
claim.
You
shall
have
a
copy
for
the
queen.
Lord
Tywin
must
withdraw
beyond
these
borders,
and
cease
his
raiding,
burning,
and
pillage.
The
Queen
Regent
and
her
son
shall
make
no
claims
to
taxes,
incomes,
nor
service
from
my
people,
and
shall
free
my
lords
and
knights
from
all
oaths
of
fealty,
vows,
pledges,
debts,
and
obligations
owed
to
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister.
Additionally,
the
Lannisters
shall
deliver
ten
highborn
hostages,
to
be
mutually
agreed
upon,
as
a
pledge
of
peace.
These
I
will
treat
as
honored
guests,
according
to
their
station.
So
long
as
the
terms
of
this
pact
are
abided
with
faithfully,
I
shall
release
two
hostages
every
year,
and
return
them
safely
to
their
families.”
Robb
tossed
the
rolled
parchment
at
the
knight’s
feet.
“There
are
the
terms.
If
she
meets
them,
I’ll
give
her
peace.
if
not”—he
whistled,
and
Grey
Wind
moved
forward
snarling—“I’ll
give
her
another
Whispering
Wood.”

“Stark!”
the
Greatjon
roared
again,
and
now
other
voices
took
up
the
cry.
“Stark,
Stark,
King
in
the
North!”
The
direwolf
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.

Ser
Cleos
had
gone
the
color
of
curdled
milk.
“The
queen
shall
hear
your
message,
my—Your
Grace.”

“Good,”
Robb
said.
“Ser
Robin,
see
that
he
has
a
good
meal
and
clean
clothing.
He’s
to
ride
at
first
light.”

“As
you
command,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Robin
Ryger
replied.

“Then
we
are
done.”
The
assembled
knights
and
lords
bannermen
bent
their
knees
as
Robb
turned
to
leave,
Grey
Wind
at
his
heels.
Olyvar
Frey
scrambled
ahead
to
open
the
door.
Catelyn
followed
them
out,
her
brother
at
her
side.

“You
did
well,”
she
told
her
son
in
the
gallery
that
led
from
the
rear
of
the
hall,
“though
that
business
with
the
wolf
was
japery
more
befitting
a
boy
than
a
king.”

Robb
scratched
Grey
Wind
behind
the
ear.
“Did
you
see
the
look
on
his
face,
Mother?”
he
asked,
smiling.

“What
I
saw
was
Lord
Karstark,
walking
out.”

“As
did
I.”
Robb
lifted
off
his
crown
with
both
hands
and
gave
it
to
Olyvar.
“Take
this
thing
back
to
my
bedchamber.”

“At
once,
Your
Grace.”
The
squire
hurried
off.

“I’ll
wager
there
were
others
who
felt
the
same
as
Lord
Karstark,”
her
brother
Edmure
declared.
“How
can
we
talk
of
peace
while
the
Lannisters
spread
like
a
pestilence
over
my
father’s
domains,
stealing
his
crops
and
slaughtering
his
people?
I
say
again,
we
ought
to
be
marching
on
Harrenhal.”

“We
lack
the
strength,”
Robb
said,
though
unhappily.

Edmure
persisted.
“Do
we
grow
stronger
sitting
here?
Our
host
dwindles
every
day.”

“And
whose
doing
is
that?”
Catelyn
snapped
at
her
brother.
It
had
been
at
Edmure’s
insistence
that
Robb
had
given
the
river
lords
leave
to
depart
after
his
crowning,
each
to
defend
his
own
lands.
Ser
Marq
Piper
and
Lord
Karyl
Vance
had
been
the
first
to
go.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
had
followed,
vowing
to
reclaim
the
burnt
shell
of
his
castle
and
bury
his
dead,
and
now
Lord
Jason
Mallister
had
announced
his
intent
to
return
to
his
seat
at
Seagard,
still
mercifully
untouched
by
the
fighting.

“You
cannot
ask
my
river
lords
to
remain
idle
while
their
fields
are
being
pillaged
and
their
people
put
to
the
sword,”
Ser
Edmure
said,
“but
Lord
Karstark
is
a
northman.
It
would
be
an
ill
thing
if
he
were
to
leave
us.”

“I’ll
speak
with
him,”
said
Robb.
“He
lost
two
sons
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
Who
can
blame
him
if
he
does
not
want
to
make
peace
with
their
killers…
with
my
father’s
killers…”

“More
bloodshed
will
not
bring
your
father
back
to
us,
or
Lord
Rickard’s
sons,”
Catelyn
said.
“An
offer
had
to
be
made—though
a
wiser
man
might
have
offered
sweeter
terms.”

“Any
sweeter
and
I
would
have
gagged.”
Her
son’s
beard
had
grown
in
redder
than
his
auburn
hair.
Robb
seemed
to
think
it
made
him
look
fierce,
royal…
older.
But
bearded
or
no,
he
was
still
a
youth
of
fifteen,
and
wanted
vengeance
no
less
than
Rickard
Karstark.
it
had
been
no
easy
thing
to
convince
him
to
make
even
this
offer,
poor
as
it
was.

“Cersei
Lannister
will
never
consent
to
trade
your
sisters
for
a
pair
of
cousins.
It’s
her
brother
she’ll
want,
as
you
know
full
well.”
She
had
told
him
as
much
before,
but
Catelyn
was
finding
that
kings
do
not
listen
half
so
attentively
as
sons.

“I
can’t
release
the
Kingslayer,
not
even
if
I
wanted
to.
My
lords
would
never
abide
it.”

“Your
lords
made
you
their
king.”

“And
can
unmake
me
just
as
easy.”

“If
your
crown
is
the
price
we
must
pay
to
have
Arya
and
Sansa
returned
safe,
we
should
pay
it
willingly.
Half
your
lords
would
like
to
murder
Lannister
in
his
cell.
If
he
should
die
while
he’s
your
prisoner,
men
will
say—”

“—that
he
well
deserved
it,”
Robb
finished.

“And
your
sisters?”
Catelyn
asked
sharply.
“Will
they
deserve
their
deaths
as
well?
I
promise
you,
if
any
harm
comes
to
her
brother,
Cersei
will
pay
us
back
blood
for
blood—”

“Lannister
won’t
die,”
Robb
said.
“No
one
so
much
as
speaks
to
him
without
my
warrant.
He
has
food,
water,
clean
straw,
more
comfort
than
he
has
any
right
to.
But
I
won’t
free
him,
not
even
for
Arya
and
Sansa.”

Her
son
was
looking
down
at
her,
Catelyn
realized.
Was
it
war
that
made
him
grow
so
fast,
she
wondered,
or
the
crown
they
had
put
on
his
head?
“Are
you
afraid
to
have
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
field
again,
is
that
the
truth
of
it?”

Grey
Wind
growled,
as
if
he
sensed
Robb’s
anger,
and
Edmure
Tully
put
a
brotherly
hand
on
Catelyn’s
shoulder.
“Cat,
don’t.
The
boy
has
the
right
of
this.”

“Don’t
call
me
the
boy,”
Robb
said,
rounding
on
his
uncle,
his
anger
spilling
out
all
at
once
on
poor
Edmure,
who
had
only
meant
to
support
him.
“I’m
almost
a
man
grown,
and
a
king—your
king,
ser.
And
I
don’t
fear
Jaime
Lannister.
I
defeated
him
once,
I’ll
defeat
him
again
if
I
must,
only…”
He
pushed
a
fall
of
hair
out
of
his
eyes
and
gave
a
shake
of
the
head.
“I
might
have
been
able
to
trade
the
Kingslayer
for
Father,
but…”

“…but
not
for
the
girls?”
Her
voice
was
icy
quiet.
“Girls
are
not
important
enough,
are
they?”

Robb
made
no
answer,
but
there
was
hurt
in
his
eyes.
Blue
eyes,
Tully
eyes,
eyes
she
had
given
him.
She
had
wounded
him,
but
he
was
too
much
his
father’s
son
to
admit
it.

That
was
unworthy
of
me,
she
told
herself.
Gods
be
good,
what
is
to
become
of
me?
He
is
doing
his
best,
trying
so
hard,
I
know
it,
I
see
it,
and
yet…
I
have
lost
my
Ned,
the
rock
my
life
was
built
on,
I
could
not
bear
to
lose
the
girls
as
well…

“I’ll
do
all
I
can
for
my
sisters,”
Robb
said.
“If
the
queen
has
any
sense,
she’ll
accept
my
terms.
If
not,
I’ll
make
her
rue
the
day
she
refused
me.”

Plainly,
he’d
had
enough
of
the
subject.
“Mother,
are
you
certain
you
will
not
consent
to
go
to
the
Twins?
You
would
be
farther
from
the
fighting,
and
you
could
acquaint
yourself
with
Lord
Frey’s
daughters
to
help
me
choose
my
bride
when
the
war
is
done.”

He
wants
me
gone,
Catelyn
thought
wearily.
Kings
are
not
supposed
to
have
mothers,
it
would
seem,
and
I
tell
him
things
he
does
not
want
to
hear.
“You’re
old
enough
to
decide
which
of
Lord
Walder’s
girls
you
prefer
without
your
mother’s
help,
Robb.”

“Then
go
with
Theon.
He
leaves
on
the
morrow.
He’ll
help
the
Mallisters
escort
that
lot
of
captives
to
Seagard
and
then
take
ship
for
the
Iron
Islands.
You
could
find
a
ship
as
well,
and
be
back
at
Winterfell
with
a
moon’s
turn,
if
the
winds
are
kind.
Bran
and
Rickon
need
you.”

And
you
do
not,
is
that
what
you
mean
to
say?
“My
lord
father
has
little
enough
time
remaining
him.
So
long
as
your
grandfather
lives,
my
place
is
at
Riverrun
with
him.”

“I
could
command
you
to
go.
As
king.
I
could.”

Catelyn
ignored
that.
“I’ll
say
again,
I
would
sooner
you
sent
someone
else
to
Pyke,
and
kept
Theon
close
to
you.”

“Who
better
to
treat
with
Balon
Greyjoy
than
his
son?”

“Jason
Mallister,”
offered
Catelyn.
“Tytos
Blackwood.
Stevron
Frey.
Anyone…
but
not
Theon.”

Her
son
squatted
beside
Grey
Wind,
ruffling
the
wolf’s
fur
and
incidentally
avoiding
her
eyes.
“Theon’s
fought
bravely
for
us.
I
told
you
how
he
saved
Bran
from
those
wildlings
in
the
wolfswood.
If
the
Lannisters
won’t
make
peace,
I’ll
have
need
of
Lord
Greyjoy’s
longships.”

“You’ll
have
them
sooner
if
you
keep
his
son
as
hostage.”

“He’s
been
a
hostage
half
his
life.”

“For
good
reason,”
Catelyn
said.
“Balon
Greyjoy
is
not
a
man
to
be
trusted.
He
wore
a
crown
himself,
remember,
if
only
for
a
season.
He
may
aspire
to
wear
one
again.”

Robb
stood.
“I
will
not
grudge
him
that.
If
I’m
King
in
the
North,
let
him
be
King
of
the
Iron
Islands,
if
that’s
his
desire.
I’ll
give
him
a
crown
gladly,
so
long
as
he
helps
us
bring
down
the
Lannisters.”

“Robb—”

“I’m
sending
Theon.
Good
day,
Mother.
Grey
Wind,
come.”
Robb
walked
off
briskly,
the
direwolf
padding
beside
him.

Catelyn
could
only
watch
him
go.
Her
son
and
now
her
king.
How
queer
that
felt.
Command,
she
had
told
him
back
in
Moat
Cailin.
And
so
he
did.
“I
am
going
to
visit
Father,”
she
announced
abruptly.
“Come
with
me,
Edmure.”

“I
need
to
have
a
word
with
those
new
bowmen
Ser
Desmond
is
training.
I’ll
visit
him
later.”

If
he
still
lives,
Catelyn
thought,
but
she
said
nothing.
Her
brother
would
sooner
face
battle
than
that
sickroom.

The
shortest
way
to
the
central
keep
where
her
father
lay
dying
was
through
the
godswood,
with
its
grass
and
wildflowers
and
thick
stands
of
elm
and
redwood.
A
wealth
of
rustling
leaves
still
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
trees,
all
ignorant
of
the
word
the
white
raven
had
brought
to
Riverrun
a
fortnight
past.
Autumn
had
come,
the
Conclave
had
declared,
but
the
gods
had
not
seen
fit
to
tell
the
winds
and
woods
as
yet.
For
that
Catelyn
was
duly
grateful.
Autumn
was
always
a
fearful
time,
with
the
specter
of
winter
looming
ahead.
Even
the
wisest
man
never
knew
whether
his
next
harvest
would
be
the
last.

Hoster
Tully,
Lord
of
Riverrun,
lay
abed
in
his
solar,
with
its
commanding
view
to
the
east
where
the
rivers
Tumblestone
and
Red
Fork
met
beyond
the
walls
of
his
castle.
He
was
sleeping
when
Catelyn
entered,
his
hair
and
beard
as
white
as
his
featherbed,
his
once
portly
frame
turned
small
and
frail
by
the
death
that
grew
within
him.

Beside
the
bed,
still
dressed
in
mail
hauberk
and
travel-stained
cloak,
sat
her
father’s
brother,
the
Blackfish.
His
boots
were
dusty
and
spattered
with
dried
mud.
“Does
Robb
know
you
are
returned,
Uncle?”
Ser
Brynden
Tully
was
Robb’s
eyes
and
ears,
the
commander
of
his
scouts
and
outriders.

“No.
I
came
here
straight
from
the
stables,
when
they
told
me
the
king
was
holding
court.
His
Grace
will
want
to
hear
my
tidings
in
private
first
I’d
think.”
The
Blackfish
was
a
tall,
lean
man,
grey
of
hair
and
precise
in
his
movements,
his
clean-shaven
face
lined
and
windburnt.
“How
is
he?”
he
asked,
and
she
knew
he
did
not
mean
Robb.

“Much
the
same.
The
maester
gives
him
dreamwine
and
milk
of
the
poppy
for
his
pain,
so
he
sleeps
most
of
the
time,
and
eats
too
little.
He
seems
weaker
with
each
day
that
passes.”

“Does
he
speak?”

“Yes…
but
there
is
less
and
less
sense
to
the
things
he
says.
He
talks
of
his
regrets,
of
unfinished
tasks,
of
people
long
dead
and
times
long
past.
Sometimes
he
does
not
know
what
season
it
is,
or
who
I
am.
Once
he
called
me
by
Mother’s
name.”

“He
misses
her
still,”
Ser
Brynden
answered.
“You
have
her
face.
I
can
see
it
in
your
cheekbones,
and
your
jaw…”

“You
remember
more
of
her
than
I
do.
It
has
been
a
long
time.”
She
seated
herself
on
the
bed
and
brushed
away
a
strand
of
fine
white
hair
that
had
fallen
across
her
father’s
face.

“Each
time
I
ride
out,
I
wonder
if
I
shall
find
him
alive
or
dead
on
my
return.”
Despite
their
quarrels,
there
was
a
deep
bond
between
her
father
and
the
brother
he
had
once
disowned.

“At
least
you
made
your
peace
with
him.”

They
sat
for
a
time
in
silence,
until
Catelyn
raised
her
head.
“You
spoke
of
tidings
that
Robb
needed
to
hear?”
Lord
Hoster
moaned
and
rolled
onto
his
side,
almost
as
if
he
had
heard.

Brynden
stood.
“Come
outside.
Best
if
we
do
not
wake
him.”

She
followed
him
out
onto
the
stone
balcony
that
jutted
three-sided
from
the
solar
like
the
prow
of
a
ship.
Her
uncle
glanced
up,
frowning.
“You
can
see
it
by
day
now.
My
men
call
it
the
Red
Messenger…
but
what
is
the
message?”

Catelyn
raised
her
eyes,
to
where
the
faint
red
line
of
the
comet
traced
a
path
across
the
deep
blue
sky
like
a
long
scratch
across
the
face
of
god.
“The
Greatjon
told
Robb
that
the
old
gods
have
unfurled
a
red
flag
of
vengeance
for
Ned.
Edmure
thinks
it’s
an
omen
of
victory
for
Riverrun—he
sees
a
fish
with
a
long
tail,
in
the
Tully
colors,
red
against
blue.”
She
sighed.
“I
wish
I
had
their
faith.
Crimson
is
a
Lannister
color.”

“That
thing’s
not
crimson,”
Ser
Brynden
said.
“Nor
Tully
red,
the
mud
red
of
the
river.
That’s
blood
up
there,
child,
smeared
across
the
sky.”

“Our
blood
or
theirs?”

“Was
there
ever
a
war
where
only
one
side
bled?”
Her
uncle
gave
a
shake
of
the
head.
“The
riverlands
are
awash
in
blood
and
flame
all
around
the
Gods
Eye.
The
fighting
has
spread
south
to
the
Blackwater
and
north
across
the
Trident,
almost
to
the
Twins.
Marq
Piper
and
Karyl
Vance
have
won
some
small
victories,
and
this
southron
lordling
Beric
Dondarrion
has
been
raiding
the
raiders,
falling
upon
Lord
Tywin’s
foraging
parties
and
vanishing
back
into
the
woods.
It’s
said
that
Ser
Burton
Crakehall
was
boasting
that
he’d
slain
Dondarrion,
until
he
led
his
column
into
one
of
Lord
Beric’s
traps
and
got
every
man
of
them
killed.”

“Some
of
Ned’s
guard
from
King’s
Landing
are
with
this
Lord
Beric,”
Catelyn
recalled.
“May
the
gods
preserve
them.”

“Dondarrion
and
this
red
priest
who
rides
with
him
are
clever
enough
to
preserve
themselves,
if
the
tales
be
true,”
her
uncle
said,
“but
your
father’s
bannermen
make
a
sadder
tale.
Robb
should
never
have
let
them
go.
They’ve
scattered
like
quail,
each
man
trying
to
protect
his
own,
and
it’s
folly,
Cat,
folly.
Jonos
Bracken
was
wounded
in
the
fighting
amidst
the
ruins
of
his
castle,
and
his
nephew
Hendry
slain.
Tytos
Blackwood’s
swept
the
Lannisters
off
his
lands,
but
they
took
every
cow
and
pig
and
speck
of
grain
and
left
him
nothing
to
defend
but
Raventree
Hall
and
a
scorched
desert.
Darry
men
recaptured
their
lord’s
keep
but
held
it
less
than
a
fortnight
before
Gregor
Clegane
descended
on
them
and
put
the
whole
garrison
to
the
sword,
even
their
lord.”

Catelyn
was
horrorstruck.
“Darry
was
only
a
child.”

“Aye,
and
the
last
of
his
line
as
well.
The
boy
would
have
brought
a
fine
ransom,
but
what
does
gold
mean
to
a
frothing
dog
like
Gregor
Clegane?
That
beast’s
head
would
make
a
noble
gift
for
all
the
people
of
the
realm,
I
vow.”

Catelyn
knew
Ser
Gregor’s
evil
reputation,
yet
still…“Don’t
speak
to
me
of
heads,
Uncle.
Cersei
has
mounted
Ned’s
on
a
spike
above
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
and
left
it
for
the
crows
and
flies.”
Even
now,
it
was
hard
for
her
to
believe
that
he
was
truly
gone.
Some
nights
she
would
wake
in
darkness,
half-asleep,
and
for
an
instant
expect
to
find
him
there
beside
her.
“Clegane
is
no
more
than
Lord
Tywin’s
catspaw.”
For
Tywin
Lannister—Lord
of
Casterly
Rock,
Warden
of
the
West,
father
to
Queen
Cersei,
Ser
Jaime
the
Kingslayer,
and
Tyrion
the
Imp,
and
grandfather
to
Joffrey
Baratheon,
the
new-crowned
boy
king—was
the
true
danger,
Catelyn
believed.

“True
enough,”
Ser
Brynden
admitted.
“And
Tywin
Lannister
is
no
man’s
fool.
He
sits
safe
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal,
feeding
his
host
on
our
harvest
and
burning
what
he
does
not
take.
Gregor
is
not
the
only
dog
he’s
loosed.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
is
in
the
field
as
well,
and
some
sellsword
out
of
Qohor
who’d
sooner
maim
a
man
than
kill
him.
I’ve
seen
what
they
leave
behind
them.
Whole
villages
put
to
the
torch,
women
raped
and
mutilated,
butchered
children
left
unburied
to
draw
wolves
and
wild
dogs…
it
would
sicken
even
the
dead.”

“When
Edmure
hears
this,
he
will
rage.”

“And
that
will
be
just
as
Lord
Tywin
desires.
Even
terror
has
its
purpose,
Cat.
Lannister
wants
to
provoke
us
to
battle.”

“Robb
is
like
to
give
him
that
wish,”
Catelyn
said,
fretful.
“He
is
restless
as
a
cat
sitting
here,
and
Edmure
and
the
Greatjon
and
the
others
will
urge
him
on.”
Her
son
had
won
two
great
victories,
smashing
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
Whispering
Wood
and
routing
his
leaderless
host
outside
the
walls
of
Riverrun
in
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
but
from
the
way
some
of
his
bannermen
spoke
of
him,
he
might
have
been
Aegon
the
Conqueror
reborn.

Brynden
Blackfish
arched
a
bushy
grey
eyebrow.
“More
fool
they.
My
first
rule
of
war,
Cat—never
give
the
enemy
his
wish.
Lord
Tywin
would
like
to
fight
on
a
field
of
his
own
choosing.
He
wants
us
to
march
on
Harrenhal.”

“Harrenhal.”
Every
child
of
the
Trident
knew
the
tales
told
of
Harrenhal,
the
vast
fortress
that
King
Harren
the
Black
had
raised
beside
the
waters
of
Gods
Eye
three
hundred
years
past,
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
had
been
seven
kingdoms,
and
the
riverlands
were
ruled
by
the
ironmen
from
the
islands.
In
his
pride,
Harren
had
desired
the
highest
hall
and
tallest
towers
in
all
Westeros.
Forty
years
it
had
taken,
rising
like
a
great
shadow
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
while
Harren’s
armies
plundered
his
neighbors
for
stone,
lumber,
gold,
and
workers.
Thousands
of
captives
died
in
his
quarries,
chained
to
his
sledges,
or
laboring
on
his
five
colossal
towers.
Men
froze
by
winter
and
sweltered
in
summer.
Weirwoods
that
had
stood
three
thousand
years
were
cut
down
for
beams
and
rafters.
Harren
had
beggared
the
riverlands
and
the
Iron
Islands
alike
to
ornament
his
dream.
And
when
at
last
Harrenhal
stood
complete,
on
the
very
day
King
Harren
took
up
residence,
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
come
ashore
at
King’s
Landing.

Catelyn
could
remember
hearing
Old
Nan
tell
the
story
to
her
own
children,
back
at
Winterfell.
“And
King
Harren
learned
that
thick
walls
and
high
towers
are
small
use
against
dragons,”
the
tale
always
ended.
“For
dragons
fly.”
Harren
and
all
his
line
had
perished
in
the
fires
that
engulfed
his
monstrous
fortress,
and
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
since
had
come
to
misfortune.
Strong
it
might
be,
but
it
was
a
dark
place,
and
cursed.

“I
would
not
have
Robb
fight
a
battle
in
the
shadow
of
that
keep,”
Catelyn
admitted.
“Yet
we
must
do
something,
Uncle.”

“And
soon,”
her
uncle
agreed.
“I
have
not
told
you
the
worst
of
it,
child.
The
men
I
sent
west
have
brought
back
word
that
a
new
host
is
gathering
at
Casterly
Rock.”

Another
Lannister
army.
The
thought
made
her
ill.
“Robb
must
be
told
at
once.
Who
will
command?”

“Ser
Stafford
Lannister,
it’s
said.”
He
turned
to
gaze
out
over
the
rivers,
his
red-and-blue
cloak
stirring
in
the
breeze.

“Another
nephew?”
The
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock
were
a
damnably
large
and
fertile
house.

“Cousin,”
Ser
Brynden
corrected.
“Brother
to
Lord
Tywin’s
late
wife,
so
twice
related.
An
old
man
and
a
bit
of
a
dullard,
but
he
has
a
son,
Ser
Daven,
who
is
more
formidable.”

“Then
let
us
hope
it
is
the
father
and
not
the
son
who
takes
this
army
into
the
field.”

“We
have
some
time
yet
before
we
must
face
them.
This
lot
will
be
sellswords,
freeriders,
and
green
boys
from
the
stews
of
Lannisport.
Ser
Stafford
must
see
that
they
are
armed
and
drilled
before
he
dare
risk
battle…
and
make
no
mistake,
Lord
Tywin
is
not
the
Kingslayer.
He
will
not
rush
in
heedless.
He
will
wait
patiently
for
Ser
Stafford
to
march
before
he
stirs
from
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal.”

“Unless…”
said
Catelyn.

“Yes?”
Ser
Brynden
prompted.

“Unless
he
must
leave
Harrenhal,”
she
said,
“to
face
some
other
threat.”

Her
uncle
looked
at
her
thoughtfully.
“Lord
Renly.”

“King
Renly.”
If
she
would
ask
help
from
the
man,
she
would
need
to
grant
him
the
style
he
had
claimed
for
himself.

“Perhaps.”
The
Blackfish
smiled
a
dangerous
smile.
“He’ll
want
something,
though.”

“He’ll
want
what
kings
always
want,”
she
said.
“Homage.”





TYRION

Janos
Slynt
was
a
butcher’s
son,
and
he
laughed
like
a
man
chopping
meat.
“More
wine?”
Tyrion
asked
him.

“I
should
not
object,”
Lord
Janos
said,
holding
out
his
cup.
He
was
built
like
a
keg,
and
had
a
similar
capacity.
“I
should
not
object
at
all.
That’s
a
fine
red.
From
the
Arbor?”

“Dornish.”
Tyrion
gestured,
and
his
serving
man
poured.
But
for
the
servants,
he
and
Lord
Janos
were
alone
in
the
Small
Hall,
at
a
small
candlelit
table
surrounded
by
darkness.
“Quite
the
find.
Dornish
wines
are
not
often
so
rich.”

“Rich,”
said
the
big
frog-faced
man,
taking
a
healthy
gulp.
He
was
not
a
man
for
sipping,
Janos
Slynt.
Tyrion
had
made
note
of
that
at
once.
“Yes,
rich,
that’s
the
very
word
I
was
searching
for,
the
very
word.
You
have
a
gift
for
words,
Lord
Tyrion,
if
I
might
say
so.
And
you
tell
a
droll
tale.
Droll,
yes.”

“I’m
pleased
you
think
so…
but
I’m
not
a
lord,
as
you
are.
A
simple
Tyrion
will
suffice
for
me,
Lord
Janos.”

“As
you
wish.”
He
took
another
swallow,
dribbling
wine
on
the
front
of
his
black
satin
doublet.
He
was
wearing
a
cloth-of-gold
half
cape
fastened
with
a
miniature
spear,
its
point
enameled
in
dark
red.
And
he
was
well
and
truly
drunk.

Tyrion
covered
his
mouth
and
belched
politely.
Unlike
Lord
Janos
he
had
gone
easy
on
the
wine,
but
he
was
very
full.
The
first
thing
he
had
done
after
taking
up
residence
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
was
inquire
after
the
finest
cook
in
the
city
and
take
her
into
his
service.
This
evening
they
had
supped
on
oxtail
soup,
summer
greens
tossed
with
pecans,
grapes,
red
fennel,
and
crumbled
cheese,
hot
crab
pie,
spiced
squash,
and
quails
drowned
in
butter.
Each
dish
had
come
with
its
own
wine.
Lord
Janos
allowed
that
he
had
never
eaten
half
so
well.
“No
doubt
that
will
change
when
you
take
your
seat
in
Harrenhal,”
Tyrion
said.

“For
a
certainty.
Perhaps
I
should
ask
this
cook
of
yours
to
enter
my
service,
what
do
you
say?”

“Wars
have
been
fought
over
less,”
he
said,
and
they
both
had
a
good
long
laugh.
“You’re
a
bold
man
to
take
Harrenhal
for
your
seat.
Such
a
grim
place,
and
huge…
costly
to
maintain.
And
some
say
cursed
as
well.”

“Should
I
fear
a
pile
of
stone?”
He
hooted
at
the
notion.
“A
bold
man,
you
said.
You
must
be
bold,
to
rise.
As
I
have.
To
Harrenhal,
yes!
And
why
not?
You
know.
You
are
a
bold
man
too,
I
sense.
Small,
mayhap,
but
bold.”

“You
are
too
kind.
More
wine?”

“No.
No,
truly,
I…
oh,
gods
be
damned,
yes.
Why
not?
A
bold
man
drinks
his
fill!”

“Truly.”
Tyrion
filled
Lord
Slynt’s
cup
to
the
brim.
“I
have
been
glancing
over
the
names
you
put
forward
to
take
your
place
as
Commander
of
the
City
Watch.”

“Good
men.
Fine
men.
Any
of
the
six
will
do,
but
I’d
choose
Allar
Deem.
My
right
arm.
Good
good
man.
Loyal.
Pick
him
and
you
won’t
be
sorry.
If
he
pleases
the
king.”

“To
be
sure.”
Tyrion
took
a
small
sip
of
his
own
wine.
“I
had
been
considering
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater.
He’s
been
captain
on
the
Mud
Gate
for
three
years,
and
he
served
with
valor
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
Rebellion.
King
Robert
knighted
him
at
Pyke.
And
yet
his
name
does
not
appear
on
your
list.”

Lord
Janos
Slynt
took
a
gulp
of
wine
and
sloshed
it
around
in
his
mouth
for
a
moment
before
swallowing.
“Bywater.
Well.
Brave
man,
to
be
sure,
yet…
he’s
rigid,
that
one.
A
queer
dog.
The
men
don’t
like
him.
A
cripple
too,
lost
his
hand
at
Pyke,
that’s
what
got
him
knighted.
A
poor
trade,
if
you
ask
me,
a
hand
for
a
ser.”
He
laughed.
“Ser
Jacelyn
thinks
overmuch
of
himself
and
his
honor,
as
I
see
it.
You’ll
do
better
leaving
that
one
where
he
is,
my
lor—Tyrion.
Allar
Deem’s
the
man
for
you.”

“Deem
is
little
loved
in
the
streets,
I
am
told.”

“He’s
feared.
That’s
better.”

“What
was
it
I
heard
of
him?
Some
trouble
in
a
brothel?”

“That.
Not
his
fault,
my
lor—Tyrion.
No.
He
never
meant
to
kill
the
woman,
that
was
her
own
doing.
He
warned
her
to
stand
aside
and
let
him
do
his
duty.”

“Still…
mothers
and
children,
he
might
have
expected
she’d
try
to
save
the
babe.”
Tyrion
smiled.
“Have
some
of
this
cheese,
it
goes
splendidly
with
the
wine.
Tell
me,
why
did
you
choose
Deem
for
that
unhappy
task?”

“A
good
commander
knows
his
men,
Tyrion.
Some
are
good
for
one
job,
some
for
another.
Doing
for
a
babe,
and
her
still
on
the
tit,
that
takes
a
certain
sort.
Not
every
man’d
do
it.
Even
if
it
was
only
some
whore
and
her
whelp.”

“I
suppose
that’s
so,”
said
Tyrion,
hearing
only
some
whore
and
thinking
of
Shae,
and
Tysha
long
ago,
and
all
the
other
women
who
had
taken
his
coin
and
his
seed
over
the
years.

Slynt
went
on,
oblivious.
“A
hard
man
for
a
hard
job,
is
Deem.
Does
as
he’s
told,
and
never
a
word
afterward.”
He
cut
a
slice
off
the
cheese.
“This
is
fine.
Sharp.
Give
me
a
good
sharp
knife
and
a
good
sharp
cheese
and
I’m
a
happy
man.”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“Enjoy
it
while
you
can.
With
the
riverlands
in
flame
and
Renly
king
in
Highgarden,
good
cheese
will
soon
be
hard
to
come
by.
So
who
sent
you
after
the
whore’s
bastard?”

Lord
Janos
gave
Tyrion
a
wary
look,
then
laughed
and
wagged
a
wedge
of
cheese
at
him.
“You’re
a
sly
one,
Tyrion.
Thought
you
could
trick
me,
did
you?
it
takes
more
than
wine
and
cheese
to
make
Janos
Slynt
tell
more
than
he
should.
I
pride
myself.
Never
a
question,
and
never
a
word
afterward,
not
with
me.”

“As
with
Deem.”

“Just
the
same.
You
make
him
your
Commander
when
I’m
off
to
Harrenhal,
and
you
won’t
regret
it.”

Tyrion
broke
off
a
nibble
of
the
cheese.
It
was
sharp
indeed,
and
veined
with
wine;
very
choice.
“Whoever
the
king
names
will
not
have
an
easy
time
stepping
into
your
armor,
I
can
tell.
Lord
Mormont
faces
the
same
problem.”

Lord
Janos
looked
puzzled.
“I
thought
she
was
a
lady.
Mormont.
Beds
down
with
bears,
that’s
the
one?”

“It
was
her
brother
I
was
speaking
of.
Jeor
Mormont,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
When
I
was
visiting
with
him
on
the
Wall,
he
mentioned
how
concerned
he
was
about
finding
a
good
man
to
take
his
place.
The
Watch
gets
so
few
good
men
these
days.”
Tyrion
grinned.
“He’d
sleep
easier
if
he
had
a
man
like
you,
I
imagine.
Or
the
valiant
Allar
Deem.”

Lord
Janos
roared.
“Small
chance
of
that!”

“One
would
think,”
Tyrion
said,
“but
life
does
take
queer
turns.
Consider
Eddard
Stark,
my
lord.
I
don’t
suppose
he
ever
imagined
his
life
would
end
on
the
steps
of
Baelor’s
Sept.”

“There
were
damn
few
as
did,”
Lord
Janos
allowed,
chuckling.

Tyrion
chuckled
too.
“A
pity
I
wasn’t
here
to
see
it.
They
say
even
Varys
was
surprised.”

Lord
Janos
laughed
so
hard
his
gut
shook.
“The
Spider,”
he
said.
“Knows
everything,
they
say.
Well,
he
didn’t
know
that.”

“How
could
he?”
Tyrion
put
the
first
hint
of
a
chill
in
his
tone.
“He
had
helped
persuade
my
sister
that
Stark
should
be
pardoned,
on
the
condition
that
he
take
the
black.”

“Eh?”
Janos
Slynt
blinked
vaguely
at
Tyrion.

“My
sister
Cersei,”
Tyrion
repeated,
a
shade
more
strongly,
in
case
the
fool
had
some
doubt
who
he
meant.
“The
Queen
Regent.”

“Yes.”
Slynt
took
a
swallow.
“As
to
that,
well…
the
king
commanded
it,
m’lord.
The
king
himself.”

“The
king
is
thirteen,”
Tyrion
reminded
him.

“Still.
He
is
the
king.”
Slynt’s
jowls
quivered
when
he
frowned.
“The
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”

“Well,
one
or
two
of
them,
at
least,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
sour
smile.
“Might
I
have
a
look
at
your
spear?”

“My
spear?”
Lord
Janos
blinked
in
confusion.

Tyrion
pointed.
“The
clasp
that
fastens
your
cape.”

Hesitantly,
Lord
Janos
drew
out
the
ornament
and
handed
it
to
Tyrion.

“We
have
goldsmiths
in
Lannisport
who
do
better
work,”
he
opined.
“The
red
enamel
blood
is
a
shade
much,
if
you
don’t
mind
my
saying.
Tell
me,
my
lord,
did
you
drive
the
spear
into
the
man’s
back
yourself,
or
did
you
only
give
the
command?”

“I
gave
the
command,
and
I’d
give
it
again.
Lord
Stark
was
a
traitor.”
The
bald
spot
in
the
middle
of
Slynt’s
head
was
beet-red,
and
his
cloth-of-gold
cape
had
slithered
off
his
shoulders
onto
the
floor.
“The
man
tried
to
buy
me.”

“Little
dreaming
that
you
had
already
been
sold.”

Slynt
slammed
down
his
wine
cup.
“Are
you
drunk?
If
you
think
I
will
sit
here
and
have
my
honor
questioned…”

“What
honor
is
that?
I
do
admit,
you
made
a
better
bargain
than
Ser
Jacelyn.
A
lordship
and
a
castle
for
a
spear
thrust
in
the
back,
and
you
didn’t
even
need
to
thrust
the
spear.”
He
tossed
the
golden
ornament
back
to
Janos
Slynt.
It
bounced
off
his
chest
and
clattered
to
the
floor
as
the
man
rose.

“I
mislike
the
tone
of
your
voice,
my
lo—Imp.
I
am
the
Lord
of
Harrenhal
and
a
member
of
the
king’s
council,
who
are
you
to
chastise
me
like
this?”

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
sideways.
“I
think
you
know
quite
well
who
I
am.
How
many
sons
do
you
have?”

“What
are
my
sons
to
you,
dwarf?”

“Dwarf?”
His
anger
flashed.
“You
should
have
stopped
at
Imp.
I
am
Tyrion
of
House
Lannister,
and
someday,
if
you
have
the
sense
the
gods
gave
a
sea
slug,
you
will
drop
to
your
knees
in
thanks
that
it
was
me
you
had
to
deal
with,
and
not
my
lord
father.
Now,
how
many
sons
do
you
have?”

Tyrion
could
see
the
sudden
fear
in
Janos
Slynt’s
eyes.
“Th—three,
m’lord.
And
a
daughter.
Please,
m’lord—”

“You
need
not
beg.”
He
slid
off
his
chair.
“You
have
my
word,
no
harm
will
come
to
them.
The
younger
boys
will
be
fostered
out
as
squires.
If
they
serve
well
and
loyally,
they
may
be
knights
in
time.
Let
it
never
be
said
that
House
Lannister
does
not
reward
those
who
serve
it.
Your
eldest
son
will
inherit
the
title
Lord
Slynt,
and
this
appalling
sigil
of
yours.”
He
kicked
at
the
little
golden
spear
and
sent
it
skittering
across
the
floor.
“Lands
will
be
found
for
him,
and
he
can
build
a
seat
for
himself.
It
will
not
be
Harrenhal,
but
it
will
be
sufficient.
It
will
be
up
to
him
to
make
a
marriage
for
the
girl.”

Janos
Slynt’s
face
had
gone
from
red
to
white.
“Wh-what…
what
do
you…?”
His
jowls
were
quivering
like
mounds
of
suet.

“What
do
I
mean
to
do
with
you?”
Tyrion
let
the
oaf
tremble
for
a
moment
before
he
answered.
“The
carrack
Summer’s
Dream
sails
on
the
morning
tide.
Her
master
tells
me
she
will
call
at
Gulltown,
the
Three
Sisters,
the
isle
of
Skagos,
and
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
When
you
see
Lord
Commander
Mormont,
give
him
my
fond
regards,
and
tell
him
that
I
have
not
forgotten
the
needs
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
I
wish
you
long
life
and
good
service,
my
lord.”

Once
Janos
Slynt
realized
he
was
not
to
be
summarily
executed,
color
returned
to
his
face.
He
thrust
his
jaw
out.
“We
will
see
about
this,
Imp.
Dwarf.
Perhaps
it
will
be
you
on
that
ship,
what
do
you
think
of
that?
Perhaps
it
will
be
you
on
the
Wall.”
He
gave
a
bark
of
anxious
laughter.
“You
and
your
threats,
well,
we
will
see.
I
am
the
king’s
friend,
you
know.
We
shall
hear
what
Joffrey
has
to
say
about
this.
And
Littlefinger
and
the
queen,
oh,
yes.
Janos
Slynt
has
a
good
many
friends.
We
will
see
who
goes
sailing,
I
promise
you.
Indeed
we
will.”

Slynt
spun
on
his
heel
like
the
watchman
he’d
once
been,
and
strode
the
length
of
the
Small
Hall,
boots
ringing
on
the
stone.
He
clattered
up
the
steps,
threw
open
the
door…
and
came
face-to-face
with
a
tall,
lantern-jawed
man
in
black
breastplate
and
gold
cloak.
Strapped
to
the
stump
of
his
right
wrist
was
an
iron
hand.
“Janos,”
he
said,
deep-set
eyes
glinting
under
a
prominent
brow
ridge
and
a
shock
of
salt-and-pepper
hair.
Six
gold
cloaks
moved
quietly
into
the
Small
Hall
behind
him
as
Janos
Slynt
backed
away.

“Lord
Slynt,”
Tyrion
called
out,
“I
believe
you
know
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater,
our
new
Commander
of
the
City
Watch.”

“We
have
a
litter
waiting
for
you,
my
lord,”
Ser
Jacelyn
told
Slynt.
“The
docks
are
dark
and
distant,
and
the
streets
are
not
safe
by
night.
Men.”

As
the
gold
cloaks
ushered
out
their
onetime
commander,
Tyrion
called
Ser
Jacelyn
to
his
side
and
handed
him
a
roll
of
parchment.
“It’s
a
long
voyage,
and
Lord
Slynt
will
want
for
company.
See
that
these
six
join
him
on
the
Summer’s
Dream.”

Bywater
glanced
over
the
names
and
smiled.
“As
you
will.”

“There’s
one,”
Tyrion
said
quietly.
“Deem.
Tell
the
captain
it
would
not
be
taken
amiss
if
that
one
should
happen
to
be
swept
overboard
before
they
reach
Eastwatch.”

“I’m
told
those
northern
waters
are
very
stormy,
my
lord.”
Ser
Jacelyn
bowed
and
took
his
leave,
his
cloak
rippling
behind
him.
He
trod
on
Slynt’s
cloth-of-gold
cape
on
his
way.

Tyrion
sat
alone,
sipping
at
what
remained
of
the
fine
sweet
Dornish
wine.
Servants
came
and
went,
clearing
the
dishes
from
the
table.
He
told
them
to
leave
the
wine.
When
they
were
done,
Varys
came
gliding
into
the
hall,
wearing
flowing
lavender
robes
that
matched
his
smell.
“Oh
sweetly
done,
my
good
lord.”

“Then
why
do
I
have
this
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth?”
He
pressed
his
fingers
into
his
temples.
“I
told
them
to
throw
Allar
Deem
into
the
sea.
I
am
sorely
tempted
to
do
the
same
with
you.”

“You
might
be
disappointed
by
the
result,”
Varys
replied.
“The
storms
come
and
go,
the
waves
crash
overhead,
the
big
fish
eat
the
little
fish,
and
I
keep
on
paddling.
Might
I
trouble
you
for
a
taste
of
the
wine
that
Lord
Slynt
enjoyed
so
much?”

Tyrion
waved
at
the
flagon,
frowning.

Varys
filled
a
cup.
“Ah.
Sweet
as
summer.”
He
took
another
sip.
“I
hear
the
grapes
singing
on
my
tongue.”

“I
wondered
what
that
noise
was.
Tell
the
grapes
to
keep
still,
my
head
is
about
to
split.
It
was
my
sister.
That
was
what
the
oh-so-loyal
Lord
Janos
refused
to
say.
Cersei
sent
the
gold
cloaks
to
that
brothel.”

Varys
tittered
nervously.
So
he
had
known
all
along.

“You
left
that
part
out,”
Tyrion
said
accusingly.

“Your
own
sweet
sister,”
Varys
said,
so
grief-stricken
he
looked
close
to
tears.
“It
is
a
hard
thing
to
tell
a
man,
my
lord.
I
was
fearful
how
you
might
take
it.
Can
you
forgive
me?”

“No,”
Tyrion
snapped.
“Damn
you.
Damn
her.”
He
could
not
touch
Cersei,
he
knew.
Not
yet,
not
even
if
he’d
wanted
to,
and
he
was
far
from
certain
that
he
did.
Yet
it
rankled,
to
sit
here
and
make
a
mummer’s
show
of
justice
by
punishing
the
sorry
likes
of
Janos
Slynt
and
Allar
Deem,
while
his
sister
continued
on
her
savage
course.
“In
future,
you
will
tell
me
what
you
know,
Lord
Varys.
All
of
what
you
know.”

The
eunuch’s
smile
was
sly.
“That
might
take
rather
a
long
time,
my
good
lord.
I
know
quite
a
lot.”

“Not
enough
to
save
this
child,
it
would
seem.”

“Alas,
no.
There
was
another
bastard,
a
boy,
older.
I
took
steps
to
see
him
removed
from
harm’s
way…
but
I
confess,
I
never
dreamed
the
babe
would
be
at
risk.
A
baseborn
girl,
less
than
a
year
old,
with
a
whore
for
a
mother.
What
threat
could
she
pose?”

“She
was
Robert’s,”
Tyrion
said
bitterly.
“That
was
enough
for
Cersei,
it
would
seem.”

“Yes.
It
is
grievous
sad.
I
must
blame
myself
for
the
poor
sweet
babe
and
her
mother,
who
was
so
young
and
loved
the
king.”

“Did
she?”
Tyrion
had
never
seen
the
dead
girl’s
face,
but
in
his
mind
she
was
Shae
and
Tysha
both.
“Can
a
whore
truly
love
anyone,
I
wonder?
No,
don’t
answer.
Some
things
I
would
rather
not
know.”
He
had
settled
Shae
in
a
sprawling
stone-and-timber
manse,
with
its
own
well
and
stable
and
garden;
he
had
given
her
servants
to
see
to
her
wants,
a
white
bird
from
the
Summer
Isles
to
keep
her
company,
silks
and
silver
and
gemstones
to
adorn
her,
guards
to
protect
her.
And
yet
she
seemed
restive.
She
wanted
to
be
with
him
more,
she
told
him;
she
wanted
to
serve
him
and
help
him.
“You
help
me
most
here,
between
the
sheets,”
he
told
her
one
night
after
their
loving
as
he
lay
beside
her,
his
head
pillowed
against
her
breast,
his
groin
aching
with
a
sweet
soreness.
She
made
no
reply,
save
with
her
eyes.
He
could
see
there
that
it
was
not
what
she’d
wanted
to
hear.

Sighing,
Tyrion
started
to
reach
for
the
wine
again,
then
remembered
Lord
Janos
and
pushed
the
flagon
away.
“It
does
seem
my
sister
was
telling
the
truth
about
Stark’s
death.
We
have
my
nephew
to
thank
for
that
madness.”

“King
Joffrey
gave
the
command.
Janos
Slynt
and
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
carried
it
out,
swiftly,
without
hesitation…”

“…almost
as
if
they
had
expected
it.
Yes,
we
have
been
over
this
ground
before,
without
profit.
A
folly.”

“With
the
City
Watch
in
hand,
my
lord,
you
are
well
placed
to
see
to
it
that
His
Grace
commits
no
further…
follies?
To
be
sure,
there
is
still
the
queen’s
household
guard
to
consider…”

“The
red
cloaks?”
Tyrion
shrugged.
“Vylarr’s
loyalty
is
to
Casterly
Rock.
He
knows
I
am
here
with
my
father’s
authority.
Cersei
would
find
it
hard
to
use
his
men
against
me…
besides,
they
are
only
a
hundred.
I
have
half
again
as
many
men
of
my
own.
And
six
thousand
gold
cloaks,
if
Bywater
is
the
man
you
claim.”

“You
will
find
Ser
Jacelyn
to
be
courageous,
honorable,
obedient…
and
most
grateful.”

“To
whom,
I
wonder?”
Tyrion
did
not
trust
Varys,
though
there
was
no
denying
his
value.
He
knew
things,
beyond
a
doubt.
“Why
are
you
so
helpful,
my
lord
Varys?”
he
asked,
studying
the
man’s
soft
hands,
the
bald
powdered
face,
the
slimy
little
smile.

“You
are
the
Hand.
I
serve
the
realm,
the
king,
and
you.”

“As
you
served
Jon
Arryn
and
Eddard
Stark?”

“I
served
Lord
Arryn
and
Lord
Stark
as
best
I
could.
I
was
saddened
and
horrified
by
their
most
untimely
deaths.”

“Think
how
I
feel.
I’m
like
to
be
next.”

“Oh,
I
think
not,”
Varys
said,
swirling
the
wine
in
his
cup.
“Power
is
a
curious
thing,
my
lord.
Perchance
you
have
considered
the
riddle
I
posed
you
that
day
in
the
inn?”

“It
has
crossed
my
mind
a
time
or
two,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“The
king,
the
priest,
the
rich
man—who
lives
and
who
dies?
Who
will
the
swordsman
obey?
It’s
a
riddle
without
an
answer,
or
rather,
too
many
answers.
All
depends
on
the
man
with
the
sword.”

“And
yet
he
is
no
one,”
Varys
said.
“He
has
neither
crown
nor
gold
nor
favor
of
the
gods,
only
a
piece
of
pointed
steel.”

“That
piece
of
steel
is
the
power
of
life
and
death.”

“Just
so…
yet
if
it
is
the
swordsmen
who
rule
us
in
truth,
why
do
we
pretend
our
kings
hold
the
power?
Why
should
a
strong
man
with
a
sword
ever
obey
a
child
king
like
Joffrey,
or
a
wine-sodden
oaf
like
his
father?
“

“Because
these
child
kings
and
drunken
oafs
can
call
other
strong
men,
with
other
swords.”

“Then
these
other
swordsmen
have
the
true
power.
Or
do
they?
Whence
came
their
swords?
Why
do
they
obey?”
Varys
smiled.
“Some
say
knowledge
is
power.
Some
tell
us
that
all
power
comes
from
the
gods.
Others
say
it
derives
from
law.
Yet
that
day
on
the
steps
of
Baelor’s
Sept,
our
godly
High
Septon
and
the
lawful
Queen
Regent
and
your
ever-so-knowledgeable
servant
were
as
powerless
as
any
cobbler
or
cooper
in
the
crowd.
Who
truly
killed
Eddard
Stark
do
you
think?
Joffrey,
who
gave
the
command?
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
who
swung
the
sword?
Or…
another?
“

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
sideways.
“Did
you
mean
to
answer
your
damned
riddle,
or
only
to
make
my
head
ache
worse?”

Varys
smiled.
“Here,
then.
Power
resides
where
men
believe
it
resides.
No
more
and
no
less.”

“So
power
is
a
mummer’s
trick?”

“A
shadow
on
the
wall,”
Varys
murmured,
“yet
shadows
can
kill.
And
ofttimes
a
very
small
man
can
cast
a
very
large
shadow.”

Tyrion
smiled.
“Lord
Varys,
I
am
growing
strangely
fond
of
you.
I
may
kill
you
yet,
but
I
think
I’d
feel
sad
about
it.”

“I
will
take
that
as
high
praise.”

“What
are
you,
Varys?”
Tyrion
found
he
truly
wanted
to
know.
“A
spider,
they
say.”

“Spies
and
informers
are
seldom
loved,
my
lord.
I
am
but
a
loyal
servant
of
the
realm.”

“And
a
eunuch.
Let
us
not
forget
that.”

“I
seldom
do.”

“People
have
called
me
a
halfman
too,
yet
I
think
the
gods
have
been
kinder
to
me.
I
am
small,
my
legs
are
twisted,
and
women
do
not
look
upon
me
with
any
great
yearning…
yet
I’m
still
a
man.
Shae
is
not
the
first
to
grace
my
bed,
and
one
day
I
may
take
a
wife
and
sire
a
son.
If
the
gods
are
good,
he’ll
look
like
his
uncle
and
think
like
his
father.
You
have
no
such
hope
to
sustain
you.
Dwarfs
are
a
jape
of
the
gods…
but
men
make
eunuchs.
Who
cut
you,
Varys?
When
and
why?
Who
are
you,
truly?”

The
eunuch’s
smile
never
flickered,
but
his
eyes
glittered
with
something
that
was
not
laughter.
“You
are
kind
to
ask,
my
lord,
but
my
tale
is
long
and
sad,
and
we
have
treasons
to
discuss.”
He
drew
a
parchment
from
the
sleeve
of
his
robe.
“The
master
of
the
King’s
Galley
White
Hart
plots
to
slip
anchor
three
days
hence
to
offer
his
sword
and
ship
to
Lord
Stannis.”

Tyrion
sighed.
“I
suppose
we
must
make
some
sort
of
bloody
lesson
out
of
the
man?”

“Ser
Jacelyn
could
arrange
for
him
to
vanish,
but
a
trial
before
the
king
would
help
assure
the
continued
loyalty
of
the
other
captains.”

And
keep
my
royal
nephew
occupied
as
well.
“As
you
say.
Put
him
down
for
a
dose
of
Joffrey’s
justice.”

Varys
made
a
mark
on
the
parchment.
“Ser
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber
Redwyne
have
bribed
a
guard
to
let
them
out
a
postern
gate,
the
night
after
next.
Arrangements
have
been
made
for
them
to
sail
on
the
Pentoshi
galley
Moonrunner,
disguised
as
oarsmen.”

“Can
we
keep
them
on
those
oars
for
a
few
years,
see
how
they
fancy
it?”
He
smiled.
“No,
my
sister
would
be
distraught
to
lose
such
treasured
guests.
Inform
Ser
Jacelyn.
Seize
the
man
they
bribed
and
explain
what
an
honor
it
is
to
serve
as
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
And
have
men
posted
around
the
Moonrunner,
in
case
the
Redwynes
find
a
second
guard
short
of
coin.”

“As
you
will.”
Another
mark
on
the
parchment.
“Your
man
Timett
slew
a
wineseller’s
son
this
evening,
at
a
gambling
den
on
the
Street
of
Silver.
He
accused
him
of
cheating
at
tiles.”

“Was
it
true?”

“Oh,
beyond
a
doubt.”

“Then
the
honest
men
of
the
city
owe
Timett
a
debt
of
gratitude.
I
shall
see
that
he
has
the
king’s
thanks.”

The
eunuch
gave
a
nervous
giggle
and
made
another
mark.
“We
also
have
a
sudden
plague
of
holy
men.
The
comet
has
brought
forth
all
manner
of
queer
priests,
preachers,
and
prophets,
it
would
seem.
They
beg
in
the
winesinks
and
pot-shops
and
foretell
doom
and
destruction
to
anyone
who
stops
to
listen.”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“We
are
close
on
the
three
hundredth
year
since
Aegon’s
Landing,
I
suppose
it
is
only
to
be
expected.
Let
them
rant.”

“They
are
spreading
fear,
my
lord.”

“I
thought
that
was
your
job.”

Varys
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand.
“You
are
very
cruel
to
say
so.
One
last
matter.
Lady
Tanda
gave
a
small
supper
last
night.
I
have
the
menu
and
the
guest
list
for
your
inspection.
When
the
wine
was
poured,
Lord
Gyles
rose
to
lift
a
cup
to
the
king,
and
Ser
Balon
Swann
was
heard
to
remark,
‘We’ll
need
three
cups
for
that.’
Many
laughed…”

Tyrion
raised
a
hand.
“Enough.
Ser
Balon
made
a
jest.
I
am
not
interested
in
treasonous
table
talk,
Lord
Varys.”

“You
are
as
wise
as
you
are
gentle,
my
lord.”
The
parchment
vanished
up
the
eunuch’s
sleeve.
“We
both
have
much
to
do.
I
shall
leave
you.”

When
the
eunuch
had
departed,
Tyrion
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
candle
and
wondering
how
his
sister
would
take
the
news
of
Janos
Slynt’s
dismissal.
Not
happily,
if
he
was
any
judge,
but
beyond
sending
an
angry
protest
to
Lord
Tywin
in
Harrenhal,
he
did
not
see
what
Cersei
could
hope
to
do
about
it.
Tyrion
had
the
City
Watch
now,
plus
a
hundred-and-a-half
fierce
clansmen
and
a
growing
force
of
sellswords
recruited
by
Bronn.
He
would
seem
well
protected.

Doubtless
Eddard
Stark
thought
the
same.

The
Red
Keep
was
dark
and
still
when
Tyrion
left
the
Small
Hall.
Bronn
was
waiting
in
his
solar.
“Slynt?”
he
asked.

“Lord
Janos
will
be
sailing
for
the
Wall
on
the
morning
tide.
Varys
would
have
me
believe
that
I
have
replaced
one
of
Joffrey’s
men
with
one
of
my
own.
More
likely,
I
have
replaced
Littlefinger’s
man
with
one
belonging
to
Varys,
but
so
be
it.”

“You’d
best
know,
Timett
killed
a
man—”

“Varys
told
me.”

The
sellsword
seemed
unsurprised.
“The
fool
figured
a
one-eyed
man
would
be
easier
to
cheat.
Timett
pinned
his
wrist
to
the
table
with
a
dagger
and
ripped
out
his
throat
barehanded.
He
has
this
trick
where
he
stiffens
his
fingers—”

“Spare
me
the
grisly
details,
my
supper
is
sitting
badly
in
my
belly,”
Tyrion
said.
“How
goes
your
recruiting?”

“Well
enough.
Three
new
men
tonight.”

“How
do
you
know
which
ones
to
hire?”

“I
look
them
over.
I
question
them,
to
learn
where
they’ve
fought
and
how
well
they
lie.”
Bronn
smiled.
“And
then
I
give
them
a
chance
to
kill
me,
while
I
do
the
same
for
them.”

“Have
you
killed
any?”

“No
one
we
could
have
used.”

“And
if
one
of
them
kills
you?”

“He’ll
be
one
you’ll
want
to
hire.”

Tyrion
was
a
little
drunk,
and
very
tired.
“Tell
me,
Bronn.
If
I
told
you
to
kill
a
babe…
an
infant
girl,
say,
still
at
her
mother’s
breast…
would
you
do
it?
Without
question?”

“Without
question?
No.”
The
sellsword
rubbed
thumb
and
forefinger
together.
“I’d
ask
how
much.”

And
why
would
I
ever
need
your
Allar
Deem,
Lord
Slynt?
Tyrion
thought.
I
have
a
hundred
of
my
own.
He
wanted
to
laugh;
he
wanted
to
weep;
most
of
all,
he
wanted
Shae.





ARYA

The
road
was
little
more
than
two
ruts
through
the
weeds.

The
good
part
was,
with
so
little
traffic
there’d
be
no
one
to
point
the
finger
and
say
which
way
they’d
gone.
The
human
flood
that
had
flowed
down
the
kingsroad
was
only
a
trickle
here.

The
bad
part
was,
the
road
wound
back
and
forth
like
a
snake,
tangling
with
even
smaller
trails
and
sometimes
seeming
to
vanish
entirely
only
to
reappear
half
a
league
farther
on
when
they
had
all
but
given
up
hope.
Arya
hated
it.
The
land
was
gentle
enough,
rolling
hills
and
terraced
fields
interspersed
with
meadows
and
woodlands
and
little
valleys
where
willows
crowded
close
to
slow
shallow
streams.
Even
so,
the
path
was
so
narrow
and
crooked
that
their
pace
had
dropped
to
a
crawl.

It
was
the
wagons
that
slowed
them,
lumbering
along,
axles
creaking
under
the
weight
of
their
heavy
loads.
A
dozen
times
a
day
they
had
to
stop
to
free
a
wheel
that
had
stuck
in
a
rut,
or
double
up
the
teams
to
climb
a
muddy
slope.
Once,
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
stand
of
oak,
they
came
face-to-face
with
three
men
pulling
a
load
of
firewood
in
an
ox
cart,
with
no
way
for
either
to
get
around.
There
had
been
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
while
the
foresters
unhitched
their
ox,
led
him
through
the
trees,
spun
the
cart,
hitched
the
ox
up
again,
and
started
back
the
way
they’d
come.
The
ox
was
even
slower
than
the
wagons,
so
that
day
they
hardly
got
anywhere
at
all.

Arya
could
not
help
looking
over
her
shoulder,
wondering
when
the
gold
cloaks
would
catch
them.
At
night,
she
woke
at
every
noise
to
grab
for
Needle’s
hilt.
They
never
made
camp
without
putting
out
sentries
now,
but
Arya
did
not
trust
them,
especially
the
orphan
boys.
They
might
have
done
well
enough
in
the
alleys
of
King’s
Landing,
but
out
here
they
were
lost.
When
she
was
being
quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
could
sneak
past
all
of
them,
flitting
out
by
starlight
to
make
her
water
in
the
woods
where
no
one
would
see.
Once,
when
Lommy
Greenhands
had
the
watch,
she
shimmied
up
an
oak
and
moved
from
tree
to
tree
until
she
was
right
above
his
head,
and
he
never
saw
a
thing.
She
would
have
jumped
down
on
top
of
him,
but
she
knew
his
scream
would
wake
the
whole
camp,
and
Yoren
might
take
a
stick
to
her
again.

Lommy
and
the
other
orphans
all
treated
the
Bull
like
someone
special
now
because
the
queen
wanted
his
head,
though
he
would
have
none
of
it.
“I
never
did
nothing
to
no
queen,”
he
said
angrily.
“I
did
my
work,
is
all.
Bellows
and
tongs
and
fetch
and
carry.
I
was
s’posed
to
be
an
armorer,
and
one
day
Master
Mott
says
I
got
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch,
that’s
all
I
know.”
Then
he’d
go
off
to
polish
his
helm.
It
was
a
beautiful
helm,
rounded
and
curved,
with
a
slit
visor
and
two
great
metal
bull’s
horns.
Arya
would
watch
him
polish
the
metal
with
an
oilcloth,
shining
it
so
bright
you
could
see
the
flames
of
the
cookfire
reflected
in
the
steel.
Yet
he
never
actually
put
it
on
his
head.

“I
bet
he’s
that
traitor’s
bastard,”
Lommy
said
one
night,
in
a
hushed
voice
so
Gendry
would
not
hear.
“The
wolf
lord,
the
one
they
nicked
on
Baelor’s
steps.”

“He
is
not,”
Arya
declared.
My
father
only
had
one
bastard,
and
that’s
Jon.
She
stalked
off
into
the
trees,
wishing
she
could
just
saddle
her
horse
and
ride
home.
She
was
a
good
horse,
a
chestnut
mare
with
a
white
blaze
on
her
forehead.
And
Arya
had
always
been
a
good
rider.
She
could
gallop
off
and
never
see
any
of
them,
unless
she
wanted
to.
Only
then
she’d
have
no
one
to
scout
ahead
of
her,
or
watch
behind,
or
stand
guard
while
she
napped,
and
when
the
gold
cloaks
caught
her,
she’d
be
all
alone.
It
was
safer
to
stay
with
Yoren
and
the
others.

“We’re
not
far
from
Gods
Eye,”
the
black
brother
said
one
morning.
“The
kingsroad
won’t
be
safe
till
we’re
across
the
Trident.
So
we’ll
come
up
around
the
lake
along
the
western
shore,
they’re
not
like
to
look
for
us
there.”
At
the
next
spot
where
two
ruts
cut
cross
each
other,
he
turned
the
wagons
west.

Here
farmland
gave
way
to
forest,
the
villages
and
holdfasts
were
smaller
and
farther
apart,
the
hills
higher
and
the
valleys
deeper.
Food
grew
harder
to
come
by.
In
the
city,
Yoren
had
loaded
up
the
wagons
with
salt
fish,
hard
bread,
lard,
turnips,
sacks
of
beans
and
barley,
and
wheels
of
yellow
cheese,
but
every
bite
of
it
had
been
eaten.
Forced
to
live
off
the
land,
Yoren
turned
to
Koss
and
Kurz,
who’d
been
taken
as
poachers.
He
would
send
them
ahead
of
the
column,
into
the
woods,
and
come
dusk
they
would
be
back
with
a
deer
slung
between
them
on
a
pole
or
a
brace
of
quail
swinging
from
their
belts.
The
younger
boys
would
be
set
to
picking
blackberries
along
the
road,
or
climbing
fences
to
fill
a
sack
with
apples
if
they
happened
upon
an
orchard.

Arya
was
a
skilled
climber
and
a
fast
picker,
and
she
liked
to
go
off
by
herself.
One
day
she
came
across
a
rabbit,
purely
by
happenstance.
It
was
brown
and
fat,
with
long
ears
and
a
twitchy
nose.
Rabbits
ran
faster
than
cats,
but
they
couldn’t
climb
trees
half
so
well.
She
whacked
it
with
her
stick
and
grabbed
it
by
its
ears,
and
Yoren
stewed
it
with
some
mushrooms
and
wild
onions.
Arya
was
given
a
whole
leg,
since
it
was
her
rabbit.
She
shared
it
with
Gendry.
The
rest
of
them
each
got
a
spoonful,
even
the
three
in
manacles.
Jaqen
H’ghar
thanked
her
politely
for
the
treat,
and
Biter
licked
the
grease
off
his
dirty
fingers
with
a
blissful
look,
but
Rorge,
the
noseless
one,
only
laughed
and
said,
“There’s
a
hunter
now.
Lumpyface
Lumpyhead
Rabbitkiller.”

Outside
a
holdfast
called
Briarwhite,
some
fieldhands
surrounded
them
in
a
cornfield,
demanding
coin
for
the
ears
they’d
taken.
Yoren
eyed
their
scythes
and
tossed
them
a
few
coppers.
“Time
was,
a
man
in
black
was
feasted
from
Dorne
to
Winterfell,
and
even
high
lords
called
it
an
honor
to
shelter
him
under
their
roofs,”
he
said
bitterly.
“Now
cravens
like
you
want
hard
coin
for
a
bite
of
wormy
apple.”
He
spat.

“It’s
sweetcorn,
better’n
a
stinking
old
black
bird
like
you
deserves,”
one
of
them
answered
roughly.
“You
get
out
of
our
field
now,
and
take
these
sneaks
and
stabbers
with
you,
or
we’ll
stake
you
up
in
the
corn
to
scare
the
other
crows
away.”

They
roasted
the
sweetcorn
in
the
husk
that
night,
turning
the
ears
with
long
forked
sticks,
and
ate
it
hot
right
off
the
cob.
Arya
thought
it
tasted
wonderful,
but
Yoren
was
too
angry
to
eat.
A
cloud
seemed
to
hang
over
him,
ragged
and
black
as
his
cloak.
He
paced
about
the
camp
restlessly,
muttering
to
himself.

The
next
day
Koss
came
racing
back
to
warn
Yoren
of
a
camp
ahead.
“Twenty
or
thirty
men,
in
mail
and
halfhelms,”
he
said.
“Some
of
them
are
cut
up
bad,
and
one’s
dying,
from
the
sound
of
him.
With
all
the
noise
he
was
making,
I
got
right
up
close.
They
got
spears
and
shields,
but
only
one
horse,
and
that’s
lame.
I
think
they
been
there
awhile,
from
the
stink
of
the
place.”

“See
a
banner?”

“Spotted
treecat,
yellow
and
black,
on
a
mud-brown
field.”

Yoren
folded
a
sourleaf
into
his
mouth
and
chewed.
“Can’t
say,”
he
admitted.
“Might
be
one
side,
might
be
t’other.
If
they’re
hurt
that
bad,
likely
they’d
take
our
mounts
no
matter
who
they
are.
Might
be
they’d
take
more
than
that.
I
believe
we’ll
go
wide
around
them.”
It
took
them
miles
out
of
their
way,
and
cost
them
two
days
at
the
least,
but
the
old
man
said
it
was
cheap
at
the
price.
“You’ll
have
time
enough
on
the
Wall.
The
rest
o’
your
lives,
most
like.
Seems
to
me
there’s
no
rush
to
get
there.
“

Arya
saw
men
guarding
the
fields
more
and
more
when
they
turned
north
again.
Often
they
stood
silently
beside
the
road,
giving
a
cold
eye
to
anyone
who
passed.
Elsewhere
they
patrolled
on
horses,
riding
their
fence
lines
with
axes
strapped
to
their
saddles.
At
one
place,
she
spotted
a
man
perched
up
in
a
dead
tree,
with
a
bow
in
his
hand
and
a
quiver
hanging
from
the
branch
beside
him.
The
moment
he
spied
them,
he
notched
an
arrow
to
his
bowstring,
and
never
looked
away
until
the
last
wagon
was
out
of
sight.
All
the
while,
Yoren
cursed.
“Him
in
his
tree,
let’s
see
how
well
he
likes
it
up
there
when
the
Others
come
to
take
him.
He’ll
scream
for
the
Watch
then,
that
he
will.”

A
day
later
Dobber
spied
a
red
glow
against
the
evening
sky.
“Either
this
road
went
and
turned
again,
or
that
sun’s
setting
in
the
north.”

Yoren
climbed
a
rise
to
get
a
better
look.
“Fire,”
he
announced.
He
licked
a
thumb
and
held
it
up.
“Wind
should
blow
it
away
from
us.
Still
bears
watching.”

And
watch
it
they
did.
As
the
world
darkened,
the
fire
seemed
to
grow
brighter
and
brighter,
until
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
north
was
ablaze.
From
time
to
time,
they
could
even
smell
the
smoke,
though
the
wind
held
steady
and
the
flames
never
got
any
closer.
By
dawn
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out,
but
none
of
them
slept
very
well
that
night.

It
was
midday
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
village
had
been.
The
fields
were
a
charred
desolation
for
miles
around,
the
houses
blackened
shells.
The
carcasses
of
burnt
and
butchered
animals
dotted
the
ground,
under
living
blankets
of
carrion
crows
that
rose,
cawing
furiously,
when
disturbed.
Smoke
still
drifted
from
inside
the
holdfast.
Its
timber
palisade
looked
strong
from
afar,
but
had
not
proved
strong
enough.

Riding
out
in
front
of
the
wagons
on
her
horse,
Arya
saw
burnt
bodies
impaled
on
sharpened
stakes
atop
the
walls,
their
hands
drawn
up
tight
in
front
of
their
faces
as
if
to
fight
off
the
flames
that
had
consumed
them.
Yoren
called
a
halt
when
they
were
still
some
distance
off,
and
told
Arya
and
the
other
boys
to
guard
the
wagons
while
he
and
Murch
and
Cutjack
went
in
on
foot.
A
flock
of
ravens
rose
from
inside
the
walls
when
they
climbed
through
the
broken
gate,
and
the
caged
ravens
in
their
wagons
called
out
to
them
with
quorks
and
raucous
shrieks.

“Should
we
go
in
after
them?”
Arya
asked
Gendry
after
Yoren
and
the
others
had
been
gone
a
long
time.

“Yoren
said
wait.”
Gendry’s
voice
sounded
hollow.
When
Arya
turned
to
look,
she
saw
that
he
was
wearing
his
helm,
all
shiny
steel
and
great
curving
horns.

When
they
finally
returned,
Yoren
had
a
little
girl
in
his
arms,
and
Murch
and
Cutjack
were
carrying
a
woman
in
a
sling
made
of
an
old
torn
quilt.
The
girl
was
no
older
than
two
and
she
cried
all
the
time,
a
whimpery
sound,
like
something
was
caught
in
her
throat.
Either
she
couldn’t
talk
yet
or
she
had
forgotten
how.
The
woman’s
right
arm
ended
in
a
bloody
stump
at
her
elbow,
and
her
eyes
didn’t
seem
to
see
anything,
even
when
she
was
looking
right
at
it.
She
talked,
but
she
only
said
one
thing.
“Please,”
she
cried,
over
and
over.
“Please.
Please.”
Rorge
thought
that
was
funny.
He
laughed
through
the
hole
in
his
face
where
his
nose
had
been,
and
Biter
started
laughing
too,
until
Murch
cursed
them
and
told
them
to
shut
up.

Yoren
had
them
fix
the
woman
a
place
in
the
back
of
a
wagon.
“And
be
quick
about
it,”
he
said.
“Come
dark,
there’ll
be
wolves
here,
and
worse.”

“I’m
scared,”
Hot
Pie
murmured
when
he
saw
the
one-armed
woman
thrashing
in
the
wagon.

“Me
too,”
Arya
confessed.

He
squeezed
her
shoulder.
“I
never
truly
kicked
no
boy
to
death,
Arry.
I
just
sold
my
mommy’s
pies,
is
all.”

Arya
rode
as
far
ahead
of
the
wagons
as
she
dared,
so
she
wouldn’t
have
to
hear
the
little
girl
crying
or
listen
to
the
woman
whisper,
“Please.”
She
remembered
a
story
Old
Nan
had
told
once,
about
a
man
imprisoned
in
a
dark
castle
by
evil
giants.
He
was
very
brave
and
smart
and
he
tricked
the
giants
and
escaped…
but
no
sooner
was
he
outside
the
castle
than
the
Others
took
him,
and
drank
his
hot
red
blood.
Now
she
knew
how
he
must
have
felt.

The
one-armed
woman
died
at
evenfall.
Gendry
and
Cutjack
dug
her
grave
on
a
hillside
beneath
a
weeping
willow.
When
the
wind
blew,
Arya
thought
she
could
hear
the
long
trailing
branches
whispering,
“Please.
Please.
Please.”
The
little
hairs
on
the
back
of
her
neck
rose,
and
she
almost
ran
from
the
graveside.

“No
fire
tonight,”
Yoren
told
them.
Supper
was
a
handful
of
wild
radishes
Koss
found,
a
cup
of
dry
beans,
water
from
a
nearby
brook.
The
water
had
a
funny
taste
to
it,
and
Lommy
told
them
it
was
the
taste
of
bodies,
rotting
someplace
upstream.
Hot
Pie
would
have
hit
him
if
old
Reysen
hadn’t
pulled
them
apart.

Arya
drank
too
much
water,
just
to
fill
her
belly
with
something.
She
never
thought
she’d
be
able
to
sleep,
yet
somehow
she
did.
When
she
woke,
it
was
pitch-black
and
her
bladder
was
full
to
bursting.
Sleepers
huddled
all
around
her,
wrapped
in
blankets
and
cloaks.
Arya
found
Needle,
stood,
listened.
She
heard
the
soft
footfalls
of
a
sentry,
men
turning
in
restless
sleep,
Rorge’s
rattling
snores,
and
the
queer
hissing
sound
that
Biter
made
when
he
slept.
From
a
different
wagon
came
the
steady
rhythmic
scrape
of
steel
on
stone
as
Yoren
sat,
chewing
sourleaf
and
sharpening
the
edge
of
his
dirk.

Hot
Pie
was
one
of
the
boys
on
watch.
“Where
you
going?”
he
asked
when
he
saw
Arya
heading
for
the
trees.

Arya
waved
vaguely
at
the
woods.

“No
you’re
not,”
Hot
Pie
said.
He
had
gotten
bolder
again
now
that
he
had
a
sword
on
his
belt,
even
though
it
was
just
a
shortsword
and
he
handled
it
like
a
cleaver.
“The
old
man
said
for
everyone
to
stay
close
tonight.”

“I
need
to
make
water,”
Arya
explained.

“Well,
use
that
tree
right
there.”
He
pointed.
“You
don’t
know
what’s
out
there,
Arry.
I
heard
wolves
before.”

Yoren
wouldn’t
like
it
if
she
fought
with
him.
She
tried
to
look
afraid.
“Wolves?
For
true?”

“I
heard,”
he
assured
her.

“I
don’t
think
I
need
to
go
after
all.”
She
went
back
to
her
blanket
and
pretended
to
sleep
until
she
heard
Hot
Pie’s
footsteps
going
away.
Then
she
rolled
over
and
slipped
off
into
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
There
were
sentries
out
this
way
too,
but
Arya
had
no
trouble
avoiding
them.
Just
to
make
sure,
she
went
out
twice
as
far
as
usual.
When
she
was
sure
there
was
no
one
near,
she
skinned
down
her
breeches
and
squatted
to
do
her
business.

She
was
making
water,
her
clothing
tangled
about
her
ankles,
when
she
heard
rustling
from
under
the
trees.
Hot
Pie,
she
thought
in
panic,
he
followed
me.
Then
she
saw
the
eyes
shining
out
from
the
wood,
bright
with
reflected
moonlight.
Her
belly
clenched
tight
as
she
grabbed
for
Needle,
not
caring
if
she
pissed
herself,
counting
eyes,
two
four
eight
twelve,
a
whole
pack…

One
of
them
came
padding
out
from
under
the
trees.
He
stared
at
her,
and
bared
his
teeth,
and
all
she
could
think
was
how
stupid
she’d
been
and
how
Hot
Pie
would
gloat
when
they
found
her
half-eaten
body
the
next
morning.
But
the
wolf
turned
and
raced
back
into
the
darkness,
and
quick
as
that
the
eyes
were
gone.
Trembling,
she
cleaned
herself
and
laced
up
and
followed
a
distant
scraping
sound
back
to
camp,
and
to
Yoren.
Arya
climbed
up
into
the
wagon
beside
him,
shaken.
“Wolves,”
she
whispered
hoarsely.
“In
the
woods.”

“Aye.
They
would
be.”
He
never
looked
at
her.

“They
scared
me.”

“Did
they?”
He
spat.
“Seems
to
me
your
kind
was
fond
o’
wolves.”

“Nymeria
was
a
direwolf.”
Arya
hugged
herself.
“That’s
different.
Anyhow,
she’s
gone.
Jory
and
I
threw
rocks
at
her
until
she
ran
off,
or
else
the
queen
would
have
killed
her.”
It
made
her
sad
to
talk
about
it.
“I
bet
if
she’d
been
in
the
city,
she
wouldn’t
have
let
them
cut
off
Father’s
head.”

“Orphan
boys
got
no
fathers,”
Yoren
said,
“or
did
you
forget
that?”
The
sourleaf
had
turned
his
spit
red,
so
it
looked
like
his
mouth
was
bleeding.
“The
only
wolves
we
got
to
fear
are
the
ones
wear
manskin,
like
those
who
done
for
that
village.”

“I
wish
I
was
home,”
she
said
miserably.
She
tried
so
hard
to
be
brave,
to
be
fierce
as
a
wolverine
and
all,
but
sometimes
she
felt
like
she
was
just
a
little
girl
after
all.

The
black
brother
peeled
a
fresh
sourleaf
from
the
bale
in
the
wagon
and
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth.
“Might
be
I
should
of
left
you
where
I
found
you,
boy.
All
of
you.
Safer
in
the
city,
seems
to
me.”

“I
don’t
care.
I
want
to
go
home.”

“Been
bringing
men
to
the
Wall
for
close
on
thirty
years.”
Froth
shone
on
Yoren’s
lips,
like
bubbles
of
blood.
“All
that
time,
I
only
lost
three.
Old
man
died
of
a
fever,
city
boy
got
snakebit
taking
a
shit,
and
one
fool
tried
to
kill
me
in
my
sleep
and
got
a
red
smile
for
his
trouble.”
He
drew
the
dirk
across
his
throat,
to
show
her.
“Three
in
thirty
years.”
He
spat
out
the
old
sourleaf.
“A
ship
now,
might
have
been
wiser.
No
chance
o’
finding
more
men
on
the
way,
but
still…
clever
man,
he’d
go
by
ship,
but
me…
thirty
years
I
been
taking
this
kingsroad.”
He
sheathed
his
dirk.
“Go
to
sleep,
boy.
Hear
me?”

She
did
try.
Yet
as
she
lay
under
her
thin
blanket,
she
could
hear
the
wolves
howling…
and
another
sound,
fainter,
no
more
than
a
whisper
on
the
wind,
that
might
have
been
screams.





DAVOS

The
morning
air
was
dark
with
the
smoke
of
burning
gods.

They
were
all
afire
now,
Maid
and
Mother,
Warrior
and
Smith,
the
Crone
with
her
pearl
eyes
and
the
Father
with
his
gilded
beard;
even
the
Stranger,
carved
to
look
more
animal
than
human.
The
old
dry
wood
and
countless
layers
of
paint
and
varnish
blazed
with
a
fierce
hungry
light.
Heat
rose
shimmering
through
the
chill
air;
behind,
the
gargoyles
and
stone
dragons
on
the
castle
walls
seemed
blurred,
as
if
Davos
were
seeing
them
through
a
veil
of
tears.
Or
as
if
the
beasts
were
trembling,
stirring…

“An
ill
thing,”
Allard
declared,
though
at
least
he
had
the
sense
to
keep
his
voice
low.
Dale
muttered
agreement.

“Silence,”
said
Davos.
“Remember
where
you
are.”
His
sons
were
good
men,
but
young,
and
Allard
especially
was
rash.
Had
I
stayed
a
smuggler,
Allard
would
have
ended
on
the
Wall.
Stannis
spared
him
from
that
end,
something
else
I
owe
him…

Hundreds
had
come
to
the
castle
gates
to
bear
witness
to
the
burning
of
the
Seven.
The
smell
in
the
air
was
ugly.
Even
for
soldiers,
it
was
hard
not
to
feel
uneasy
at
such
an
affront
to
the
gods
most
had
worshiped
all
their
lives.

The
red
woman
walked
round
the
fire
three
times,
praying
once
in
the
speech
of
Asshai,
once
in
High
Valyrian,
and
once
in
the
Common
Tongue.
Davos
understood
only
the
last.
“R’hllor,
come
to
us
in
our
darkness,”
she
called.
“Lord
of
Light,
we
offer
you
these
false
gods,
these
seven
who
are
one,
and
him
the
enemy.
Take
them
and
cast
your
light
upon
us,
for
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.”
Queen
Selyse
echoed
the
words.
Beside
her,
Stannis
watched
impassively,
his
jaw
hard
as
stone
under
the
blue-black
shadow
of
his
tight-cropped
beard.
He
had
dressed
more
richly
than
was
his
wont,
as
if
for
the
sept.

Dragonstone’s
sept
had
been
where
Aegon
the
Conqueror
knelt
to
pray
the
night
before
he
sailed.
That
had
not
saved
it
from
the
queen’s
men.
They
had
overturned
the
altars,
pulled
down
the
statues,
and
smashed
the
stained
glass
with
warhammers.
Septon
Barre
could
only
curse
them,
but
Ser
Hubard
Rambton
led
his
three
sons
to
the
sept
to
defend
their
gods.
The
Rambtons
had
slain
four
of
the
queen’s
men
before
the
others
overwhelmed
them.
Afterward
Guncer
Sunglass,
mildest
and
most
pious
of
lords,
told
Stannis
he
could
no
longer
support
his
claim.
Now
he
shared
a
sweltering
cell
with
the
septon
and
Ser
Hubard’s
two
surviving
sons.
The
other
lords
had
not
been
slow
to
take
the
lesson.

The
gods
had
never
meant
much
to
Davos
the
smuggler,
though
like
most
men
he
had
been
known
to
make
offerings
to
the
Warrior
before
battle,
to
the
Smith
when
he
launched
a
ship,
and
to
the
Mother
whenever
his
wife
grew
great
with
child.
He
felt
ill
as
he
watched
them
burn,
and
not
only
from
the
smoke.

Maester
Cressen
would
have
stopped
this.
The
old
man
had
challenged
the
Lord
of
Light
and
been
struck
down
for
his
impiety,
or
so
the
gossips
told
each
other.
Davos
knew
the
truth.
He
had
seen
the
maester
slip
something
into
the
wine
cup.
Poison.
What
else
could
it
be?
He
drank
a
cup
of
death
to
free
Stannis
from
Melisandre,
but
somehow
her
god
shielded
her.
He
would
gladly
have
killed
the
red
woman
for
that,
yet
what
chance
would
he
have
where
a
maester
of
the
Citadel
had
failed?
He
was
only
a
smuggler
raised
high,
Davos
of
Flea
Bottom,
the
Onion
Knight.

The
burning
gods
cast
a
pretty
light,
wreathed
in
their
robes
of
shifting
flame,
red
and
orange
and
yellow.
Septon
Barre
had
once
told
Davos
how
they’d
been
carved
from
the
masts
of
the
ships
that
had
carried
the
first
Targaryens
from
Valyria.
Over
the
centuries,
they
had
been
painted
and
repainted,
gilded,
silvered,
jeweled.
“Their
beauty
will
make
them
more
pleasing
to
R’hllor,”
Melisandre
said
when
she
told
Stannis
to
pull
them
down
and
drag
them
out
the
castle
gates.

The
Maiden
lay
athwart
the
Warrior,
her
arms
widespread
as
if
to
embrace
him.
The
Mother
seemed
almost
to
shudder
as
the
flames
came
licking
up
her
face.
A
longsword
had
been
thrust
through
her
heart,
and
its
leather
grip
was
alive
with
flame.
The
Father
was
on
the
bottom,
the
first
to
fall.
Davos
watched
the
hand
of
the
Stranger
writhe
and
curl
as
the
fingers
blackened
and
fell
away
one
by
one,
reduced
to
so
much
glowing
charcoal.
Nearby,
Lord
Celtigar
coughed
fitfully
and
covered
his
wrinkled
face
with
a
square
of
linen
embroidered
in
red
crabs.
The
Myrmen
swapped
jokes
as
they
enjoyed
the
warmth
of
the
fire,
but
young
Lord
Bar
Emmon
had
turned
a
splotchy
grey,
and
Lord
Velaryon
was
watching
the
king
rather
than
the
conflagration.

Davos
would
have
given
much
to
know
what
he
was
thinking,
but
one
such
as
Velaryon
would
never
confide
in
him.
The
Lord
of
the
Tides
was
of
the
blood
of
ancient
Valyria,
and
his
House
had
thrice
provided
brides
for
Targaryen
princes;
Davos
Seaworth
stank
of
fish
and
onions.
It
was
the
same
with
the
other
lordlings.
He
could
trust
none
of
them,
nor
would
they
ever
include
him
in
their
private
councils.
They
scorned
his
sons
as
well.
My
grandsons
will
joust
with
theirs,
though,
and
one
day
their
blood
may
wed
with
mine.
In
time
my
little
black
ship
will
fly
as
high
as
Velaryon’s
seahorse
or
Celtigar’s
red
crabs.

That
is,
if
Stannis
won
his
throne.
If
he
lost…

Everything
I
am,
I
owe
to
him.
Stannis
had
raised
him
to
knighthood.
He
had
given
him
a
place
of
honor
at
his
table,
a
war
galley
to
sail
in
place
of
a
smuggler’s
skiff.
Dale
and
Allard
captained
galleys
as
well,
Maric
was
oarmaster
on
the
Fury,
Matthos
served
his
father
on
Black
Betha,
and
the
king
had
taken
Devan
as
a
royal
squire.
One
day
he
would
be
knighted,
and
the
two
little
lads
as
well.
Marya
was
mistress
of
a
small
keep
on
Cape
Wrath,
with
servants
who
called
her
m’lady,
and
Davos
could
hunt
red
deer
in
his
own
woods.
All
this
he
had
of
Stannis
Baratheon,
for
the
price
of
a
few
finger
joints.
It
was
just,
what
he
did
to
me.
I
had
flouted
the
king’s
laws
all
my
life.
He
has
earned
my
loyalty.
Davos
touched
the
little
pouch
that
hung
from
the
leather
thong
about
his
neck.
His
fingers
were
his
luck,
and
he
needed
luck
now.
As
do
we
all.
Lord
Stannis
most
of
all.

Pale
flames
licked
at
the
grey
sky.
Dark
smoke
rose,
twisting
and
curling.
When
the
wind
pushed
it
toward
them,
men
blinked
and
wept
and
rubbed
their
eyes.
Allard
turned
his
head
away,
coughing
and
cursing.
A
taste
of
things
to
come,
thought
Davos.
Many
and
more
would
burn
before
this
war
was
done.

Melisandre
was
robed
all
in
scarlet
satin
and
blood
velvet,
her
eyes
as
red
as
the
great
ruby
that
glistened
at
her
throat
as
if
it
too
were
afire.
“In
ancient
books
of
Asshai
it
is
written
that
there
will
come
a
day
after
a
long
summer
when
the
stars
bleed
and
the
cold
breath
of
darkness
falls
heavy
on
the
world.
In
this
dread
hour
a
warrior
shall
draw
from
the
fire
a
burning
sword.
And
that
sword
shall
be
Lightbringer,
the
Red
Sword
of
Heroes,
and
he
who
clasps
it
shall
be
Azor
Ahai
come
again,
and
the
darkness
shall
flee
before
him.”
She
lifted
her
voice,
so
it
carried
out
over
the
gathered
host.
“Azor
Ahai,
beloved
of
R’hllor!
The
Warrior
of
Light,
the
Son
of
Fire!
Come
forth,
your
sword
awaits
you!
Come
forth
and
take
it
into
your
hand!”

Stannis
Baratheon
strode
forward
like
a
soldier
marching
into
battle.
His
squires
stepped
up
to
attend
him.
Davos
watched
as
his
son
Devan
pulled
a
long
padded
glove
over
the
king’s
right
hand.
The
boy
wore
a
cream-colored
doublet
with
a
fiery
heart
sewn
on
the
breast.
Bryen
Farring
was
similarly
garbed
as
he
tied
a
stiff
leather
cape
around
His
Grace’s
neck.
Behind,
Davos
heard
a
faint
clank
and
clatter
of
bells.
“Under
the
sea,
smoke
rises
in
bubbles,
and
flames
burn
green
and
blue
and
black,”
Patchface
sang
somewhere.
“I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.”

The
king
plunged
into
the
fire
with
his
teeth
clenched,
holding
the
leather
cloak
before
him
to
keep
off
the
flames.
He
went
straight
to
the
Mother,
grasped
the
sword
with
his
gloved
hand,
and
wrenched
it
free
of
the
burning
wood
with
a
single
hard
jerk.
Then
he
was
retreating,
the
sword
held
high,
jade-green
flames
swirling
around
cherry-red
steel.
Guards
rushed
to
beat
out
the
cinders
that
clung
to
the
king’s
clothing.

“A
sword
of
fire!”
shouted
Queen
Selyse.
Ser
Axell
Florent
and
the
other
queen’s
men
took
up
the
cry.
“A
sword
of
fire!
It
burns!
It
burns!
A
sword
of
fire!”

Melisandre
lifted
her
hands
above
her
head.
“Behold!
A
sign
was
promised,
and
now
a
sign
is
seen!
Behold
Lightbringer!
Azor
Ahai
has
come
again!
All
hail
the
Warrior
of
Light!
All
hail
the
Son
of
Fire!”

A
ragged
wave
of
shouts
gave
answer,
just
as
Stannis’s
glove
began
to
smolder.
Cursing,
the
king
thrust
the
point
of
the
sword
into
the
damp
earth
and
beat
out
the
flames
against
his
leg.

“Lord,
cast
your
light
upon
us!”
Melisandre
called
out.

“For
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors,”
Selyse
and
her
queen’s
men
replied.
Should
I
speak
the
words
as
well?
Davos
wondered.
Do
I
owe
Stannis
that
much?
Is
this
fiery
god
truly
his
own?
His
shortened
fingers
twitched.

Stannis
peeled
off
the
glove
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
gods
in
the
pyre
were
scarcely
recognizable
anymore.
The
head
fell
off
the
Smith
with
a
puff
of
ash
and
embers.
Melisandre
sang
in
the
tongue
of
Asshai,
her
voice
rising
and
falling
like
the
tides
of
the
sea.
Stannis
untied
his
singed
leather
cape
and
listened
in
silence.
Thrust
in
the
ground,
Lightbringer
still
glowed
ruddy
hot,
but
the
flames
that
clung
to
the
sword
were
dwindling
and
dying.

By
the
time
the
song
was
done,
only
charwood
remained
of
the
gods,
and
the
king’s
patience
had
run
its
course.
He
took
the
queen
by
the
elbow
and
escorted
her
back
into
Dragonstone,
leaving
Lightbringer
where
it
stood.
The
red
woman
remained
a
moment
to
watch
as
Devan
knelt
with
Byren
Farring
and
rolled
up
the
burnt
and
blackened
sword
in
the
king’s
leather
cloak.
The
Red
Sword
of
Heroes
looks
a
proper
mess,
thought
Davos.

A
few
of
the
lords
lingered
to
speak
in
quiet
voices
upwind
of
the
fire.
They
fell
silent
when
they
saw
Davos
looking
at
them.
Should
Stannis
fall,
they
will
pull
me
down
in
an
instant.
Neither
was
he
counted
one
of
the
queen’s
men,
that
group
of
ambitious
knights
and
minor
lordlings
who
had
given
themselves
to
this
Lord
of
Light
and
so
won
the
favor
and
patronage
of
Lady—no,
Queen,
remember?—Selyse.

The
fire
had
started
to
dwindle
by
the
time
Melisandre
and
the
squires
departed
with
the
precious
sword.
Davos
and
his
sons
joined
the
crowd
making
its
way
down
to
the
shore
and
the
waiting
ships.
“Devan
acquitted
himself
well,”
he
said
as
they
went.

“He
fetched
the
glove
without
dropping
it,
yes,”
said
Dale.

Allard
nodded.
“That
badge
on
Devan’s
doublet,
the
fiery
heart,
what
was
that?
The
Baratheon
sigil
is
a
crowned
stag.”

“A
lord
can
choose
more
than
one
badge,”
Davos
said.

Dale
smiled.
“A
black
ship
and
an
onion,
Father?”

Allard
kicked
at
a
stone.
“The
Others
take
our
onion…
and
that
flaming
heart.
It
was
an
ill
thing
to
burn
the
Seven.”

“When
did
you
grow
so
devout?”
Davos
said.
“What
does
a
smuggler’s
son
know
of
the
doings
of
gods?”

“I’m
a
knight’s
son,
Father.
If
you
won’t
remember,
why
should
they?
“

“A
knight’s
son,
but
not
a
knight,”
said
Davos.
“Nor
will
you
ever
be,
if
you
meddle
in
affairs
that
do
not
concern
you.
Stannis
is
our
rightful
king,
it
is
not
for
us
to
question
him.
We
sail
his
ships
and
do
his
bidding.
That
is
all.”

“As
to
that,
Father,”
Dale
said,
“I
mislike
these
water
casks
they’ve
given
me
for
Wraith.
Green
pine.
The
water
will
spoil
on
a
voyage
of
any
length.”

“I
got
the
same
for
Lady
Marya,”
said
Allard.
“The
queen’s
men
have
laid
claim
to
all
the
seasoned
wood.”

“I
will
speak
to
the
king
about
it,”
Davos
promised.
Better
it
come
from
him
than
from
Allard.
His
sons
were
good
fighters
and
better
sailors,
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
talk
to
lords.
They
were
lowborn,
even
as
I
was,
but
they
do
not
like
to
recall
that.
When
they
look
at
our
banner,
all
they
see
is
a
tall
black
ship
flying
on
the
wind.
They
close
their
eyes
to
the
onion.

The
port
was
as
crowded
as
Davos
had
ever
known
it.
Every
dock
teemed
with
sailors
loading
provisions,
and
every
inn
was
packed
with
soldiers
dicing
or
drinking
or
looking
for
a
whore…
a
vain
search,
since
Stannis
permitted
none
on
his
island.
Ships
lined
the
strand;
war
galleys
and
fishing
vessels,
stout
carracks
and
fat-bottomed
cogs.
The
best
berths
had
been
taken
by
the
largest
vessels:
Stannis’s
flagship
Fury
rocking
between
Lord
Steffon
and
Stag
of
the
Sea,
Lord
Velaryon’s
silver-hulled
Pride
of
Driftmark
and
her
three
sisters,
Lord
Celtigar’s
ornate
Red
Claw,
the
ponderous
Swordfish
with
her
long
iron
prow.
Out
to
sea
at
anchor
rode
Salladhor
Saan’s
great
Valyrian
amongst
the
striped
hulls
of
two
dozen
smaller
Lysene
galleys.

A
weathered
little
inn
sat
on
the
end
of
the
stone
pier
where
Black
Betha,
Wraith,
and
Lady
Marya
shared
mooring
space
with
a
half-dozen
other
galleys
of
one
hundred
oars
or
less.
Davos
had
a
thirst.
He
took
his
leave
of
his
sons
and
turned
his
steps
toward
the
inn.
Out
front
squatted
a
waist-high
gargoyle,
so
eroded
by
rain
and
salt
that
his
features
were
all
but
obliterated.
He
and
Davos
were
old
friends,
though.
He
gave
a
pat
to
the
stone
head
as
he
went
in.
“Luck,”
he
murmured.

Across
the
noisy
common
room,
Salladhor
Saan
sat
eating
grapes
from
a
wooden
bowl.
When
he
spied
Davos,
he
beckoned
him
closer.
“Ser
knight,
come
sit
with
me.
Eat
a
grape.
Eat
two.
They
are
marvelously
sweet.”
The
Lyseni
was
a
sleek,
smiling
man
whose
flamboyance
was
a
byword
on
both
sides
of
the
narrow
sea.
Today
he
wore
flashing
cloth-of-silver,
with
dagged
sleeves
so
long
the
ends
of
them
pooled
on
the
floor.
His
buttons
were
carved
jade
monkeys,
and
atop
his
wispy
white
curls
perched
a
jaunty
green
cap
decorated
with
a
fan
of
peacock
feathers.

Davos
threaded
his
way
through
the
tables
to
a
chair.
In
the
days
before
his
knighthood,
he
had
often
bought
cargoes
from
Salladhor
Saan.
The
Lyseni
was
a
smuggler
himself,
as
well
as
a
trader,
a
banker,
a
notorious
pirate,
and
the
self-styled
Prince
of
the
Narrow
Sea.
When
a
pirate
grows
rich
enough,
they
make
him
a
prince.
It
had
been
Davos
who
had
made
the
journey
to
Lys
to
recruit
the
old
rogue
to
Lord
Stannis’s
cause.

“You
did
not
see
the
gods
burn,
my
lord?”
he
asked.

“The
red
priests
have
a
great
temple
on
Lys.
Always
they
are
burning
this
and
burning
that,
crying
out
to
their
R’hllor.
They
bore
me
with
their
fires.
Soon
they
will
bore
King
Stannis
too,
it
is
to
be
hoped.”
He
seemed
utterly
unconcerned
that
someone
might
overhear
him,
eating
his
grapes
and
dribbling
the
seeds
out
onto
his
lip,
flicking
them
off
with
a
finger.
“My
Bird
of
a
Thousand
Colors
came
in
yesterday,
good
ser.
She
is
not
a
warship,
no,
but
a
trader,
and
she
paid
a
call
on
King’s
Landing.
Are
you
sure
you
will
not
have
a
grape?
Children
go
hungry
in
the
city,
it
is
said.”
He
dangled
the
grapes
before
Davos
and
smiled.

“It’s
ale
I
need,
and
news.”

“The
men
of
Westeros
are
ever
rushing,”
complained
Salladhor
Saan.
“What
good
is
this,
I
ask
you?
He
who
hurries
through
life
hurries
to
his
grave.”
He
belched.
“The
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
has
sent
his
dwarf
to
see
to
King’s
Landing.
Perhaps
he
hopes
that
his
ugly
face
will
frighten
off
attackers,
eh?
Or
that
we
will
laugh
ourselves
dead
when
the
Imp
capers
on
the
battlements,
who
can
say?
The
dwarf
has
chased
off
the
lout
who
ruled
the
gold
cloaks
and
put
in
his
place
a
knight
with
an
iron
hand.”
He
plucked
a
grape,
and
squeezed
it
between
thumb
and
forefinger
until
the
skin
burst.
juice
ran
down
between
his
fingers.

A
serving
girl
pushed
her
way
through,
swatting
at
the
hands
that
groped
her
as
she
passed.
Davos
ordered
a
tankard
of
ale,
turned
back
to
Saan,
and
said,
“How
well
is
the
city
defended?”

The
other
shrugged.
“The
walls
are
high
and
strong,
but
who
will
man
them?
They
are
building
scorpions
and
spitfires,
oh,
yes,
but
the
men
in
the
golden
cloaks
are
too
few
and
too
green,
and
there
are
no
others.
A
swift
strike,
like
a
hawk
plummeting
at
a
hare,
and
the
great
city
will
be
ours.
Grant
us
wind
to
fill
our
sails,
and
your
king
could
sit
upon
his
Iron
Throne
by
evenfall
on
the
morrow.
We
could
dress
the
dwarf
in
motley
and
prick
his
little
cheeks
with
the
points
of
our
spears
to
make
him
dance
for
us,
and
mayhaps
your
goodly
king
would
make
me
a
gift
of
the
beautiful
Queen
Cersei
to
warm
my
bed
for
a
night.
I
have
been
too
long
away
from
my
wives,
and
all
in
his
service.”

“Pirate,”
said
Davos.
“You
have
no
wives,
only
concubines,
and
you
have
been
well
paid
for
every
day
and
every
ship.”

“Only
in
promises,”
said
Salladhor
Saan
mournfully.
“Good
ser,
it
is
gold
I
crave,
not
words
on
papers.”
He
popped
a
grape
into
his
mouth.

“You’ll
have
your
gold
when
we
take
the
treasury
in
King’s
Landing.
No
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
more
honorable
than
Stannis
Baratheon.
He
will
keep
his
word.”
Even
as
Davos
spoke,
he
thought,
This
world
is
twisted
beyond
hope,
when
lowborn
smugglers
must
vouch
for
the
honor
of
kings.

“So
he
has
said
and
said.
And
so
I
say,
let
us
do
this
thing.
Even
these
grapes
could
be
no
more
ripe
than
that
city,
my
old
friend.”

The
serving
girl
returned
with
his
ale.
Davos
gave
her
a
copper.
“Might
be
we
could
take
King’s
Landing,
as
you
say,”
he
said
as
he
lifted
the
tankard,
“but
how
long
would
we
hold
it?
Tywin
Lannister
is
known
to
be
at
Harrenhal
with
a
great
host,
and
Lord
Renly…”

“Ah,
yes,
the
young
brother,”
said
Salladhor
Saan.
“That
part
is
not
so
good,
my
friend.
King
Renly
bestirs
himself.
No,
here
he
is
Lord
Renly,
my
pardons.
So
many
kings,
my
tongue
grows
weary
of
the
word.
The
brother
Renly
has
left
Highgarden
with
his
fair
young
queen,
his
flowered
lords
and
shining
knights,
and
a
mighty
host
of
foot.
He
marches
up
your
road
of
roses
toward
the
very
same
great
city
we
were
speaking
of.”

“He
takes
his
bride?”

The
other
shrugged.
“He
did
not
tell
me
why.
Perhaps
he
is
loath
to
part
with
the
warm
burrow
between
her
thighs,
even
for
a
night.
Or
perhaps
he
is
that
certain
of
his
victory.”

“The
king
must
be
told.”

“I
have
attended
to
it,
good
ser.
Though
His
Grace
frowns
so
whenever
he
does
see
me
that
I
tremble
to
come
before
him.
Do
you
think
he
would
like
me
better
if
I
wore
a
hair
shirt
and
never
smiled?
Well,
I
will
not
do
it.
I
am
an
honest
man,
he
must
suffer
me
in
silk
and
samite.
Or
else
I
shall
take
my
ships
where
I
am
better
loved.
That
sword
was
not
Lightbringer,
my
friend.”

The
sudden
shift
in
subject
left
Davos
uneasy.
“Sword?”

“A
sword
plucked
from
fire,
yes.
Men
tell
me
things,
it
is
my
pleasant
smile.
How
shall
a
burnt
sword
serve
Stannis?”

“A
burning
sword,”
corrected
Davos.

“Burnt,”
said
Salladhor
Saan,
“and
be
glad
of
that,
my
friend.
Do
you
know
the
tale
of
the
forging
of
Lightbringer?
I
shall
tell
it
to
you.
It
was
a
time
when
darkness
lay
heavy
on
the
world.
To
oppose
it,
the
hero
must
have
a
hero’s
blade,
oh,
like
none
that
had
ever
been.
And
so
for
thirty
days
and
thirty
nights
Azor
Ahai
labored
sleepless
in
the
temple,
forging
a
blade
in
the
sacred
fires.
Heat
and
hammer
and
fold,
heat
and
hammer
and
fold,
oh,
yes,
until
the
sword
was
done.
Yet
when
he
plunged
it
into
water
to
temper
the
steel
it
burst
asunder.

“Being
a
hero,
it
was
not
for
him
to
shrug
and
go
in
search
of
excellent
grapes
such
as
these,
so
again
he
began.
The
second
time
it
took
him
fifty
days
and
fifty
nights,
and
this
sword
seemed
even
finer
than
the
first.
Azor
Ahai
captured
a
lion,
to
temper
the
blade
by
plunging
it
through
the
beast’s
red
heart,
but
once
more
the
steel
shattered
and
split.
Great
was
his
woe
and
great
was
his
sorrow
then,
for
he
knew
what
he
must
do.

“A
hundred
days
and
a
hundred
nights
he
labored
on
the
third
blade,
and
as
it
glowed
white-hot
in
the
sacred
fires,
he
summoned
his
wife.
‘Nissa
Nissa’
he
said
to
her,
for
that
was
her
name,
‘bare
your
breast,
and
know
that
I
love
you
best
of
all
that
is
in
this
world.’
She
did
this
thing,
why
I
cannot
say,
and
Azor
Ahai
thrust
the
smoking
sword
through
her
living
heart.
It
is
said
that
her
cry
of
anguish
and
ecstasy
left
a
crack
across
the
face
of
the
moon,
but
her
blood
and
her
soul
and
her
strength
and
her
courage
all
went
into
the
steel.
Such
is
the
tale
of
the
forging
of
Lightbringer,
the
Red
Sword
of
Heroes.

“Now
do
you
see
my
meaning?
Be
glad
that
it
is
just
a
burnt
sword
that
His
Grace
pulled
from
that
fire.
Too
much
light
can
hurt
the
eyes,
my
friend,
and
fire
burns.”
Salladhor
Saan
finished
the
last
grape
and
smacked
his
lips.
“When
do
you
think
the
king
will
bid
us
sail,
good
ser?
“

“Soon,
I
think,”
said
Davos,
“if
his
god
wills
it.”

“His
god,
ser
friend?
Not
yours?
Where
is
the
god
of
Ser
Davos
Seaworth,
knight
of
the
onion
ship?”

Davos
sipped
his
ale
to
give
himself
a
moment.
The
inn
is
crowded,
and
you
are
not
Salladhor
Saan,
he
reminded
himself.
Be
careful
how
you
answer.
“King
Stannis
is
my
god.
He
made
me
and
blessed
me
with
his
trust.”

“I
will
remember.”
Salladhor
Saan
got
to
his
feet.
“My
pardons.
These
grapes
have
given
me
a
hunger,
and
dinner
awaits
on
my
Valyrian.
Minced
lamb
with
pepper
and
roasted
gull
stuffed
with
mushrooms
and
fennel
and
onion.
Soon
we
shall
eat
together
in
King’s
Landing,
yes?
In
the
Red
Keep
we
shall
feast,
while
the
dwarf
sings
us
a
jolly
tune.
When
you
speak
to
King
Stannis,
mention
if
you
would
that
he
will
owe
me
another
thirty
thousand
dragons
come
the
black
of
the
moon.
He
ought
to
have
given
those
gods
to
me.
They
were
too
beautiful
to
burn,
and
might
have
brought
a
noble
price
in
Pentos
or
Myr.
Well,
if
he
grants
me
Queen
Cersei
for
a
night
I
shall
forgive
him.”
The
Lyseni
clapped
Davos
on
the
back,
and
swaggered
from
the
inn
as
if
he
owned
it.

Ser
Davos
Seaworth
lingered
over
his
tankard
for
a
good
while,
thinking.
A
year
ago,
he
had
been
with
Stannis
in
King’s
Landing
when
King
Robert
staged
a
tourney
for
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day.
He
remembered
the
red
priest
Thoros
of
Myr,
and
the
flaming
sword
he
had
wielded
in
the
melee.
The
man
had
made
for
a
colorful
spectacle,
his
red
robes
flapping
while
his
blade
writhed
with
pale
green
flames,
but
everyone
knew
there
was
no
true
magic
to
it,
and
in
the
end
his
fire
had
guttered
out
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce
had
brained
him
with
a
common
mace.

A
true
sword
of
fire,
now,
that
would
be
a
wonder
to
behold.
Yet
at
such
a
cost…
When
he
thought
of
Nissa
Nissa,
it
was
his
own
Marya
he
pictured,
a
good-natured
plump
woman
with
sagging
breasts
and
a
kindly
smile,
the
best
woman
in
the
world.
He
tried
to
picture
himself
driving
a
sword
through
her,
and
shuddered.
I
am
not
made
of
the
stuff
of
heroes,
he
decided.
If
that
was
the
price
of
a
magic
sword,
it
was
more
than
he
cared
to
pay.

Davos
finished
his
ale,
pushed
away
the
tankard,
and
left
the
inn.
On
the
way
out
he
patted
the
gargoyle
on
the
head
and
muttered,
“Luck.”
They
would
all
need
it.

It
was
well
after
dark
when
Devan
came
down
to
Black
Betha,
leading
a
snow-white
palfrey.
“My
lord
father,”
he
announced,
“His
Grace
commands
you
to
attend
him
in
the
Chamber
of
the
Painted
Table.
You
are
to
ride
the
horse
and
come
at
once.”

It
was
good
to
see
Devan
looking
so
splendid
in
his
squire’s
raiment,
but
the
summons
made
Davos
uneasy.
Will
he
bid
us
sail?
he
wondered.
Salladhor
Saan
was
not
the
only
captain
who
felt
that
King’s
Landing
was
ripe
for
an
attack,
but
a
smuggler
must
learn
patience.
We
have
no
hope
of
victory.
I
said
as
much
to
Maester
Cressen,
the
day
I
returned
to
Dragonstone,
and
nothing
has
changed.
We
are
too
few,
the
foes
too
many.
ff
we
dip
our
oars,
we
die.
Nonetheless,
he
climbed
onto
the
horse.

When
Davos
arrived
at
the
Stone
Drum,
a
dozen
highborn
knights
and
great
bannermen
were
just
leaving.
Lords
Celtigar
and
Velaryon
each
gave
him
a
curt
nod
and
walked
on
while
the
others
ignored
him
utterly,
but
Ser
Axell
Florent
stopped
for
a
word.

Queen
Selyse’s
uncle
was
a
keg
of
a
man
with
thick
arms
and
bandy
legs.
He
had
the
prominent
ears
of
a
Florent,
even
larger
than
his
niece’s.
The
coarse
hair
that
sprouted
from
his
did
not
stop
him
hearing
most
of
what
went
on
in
the
castle.
For
ten
years
Ser
Axell
had
served
as
castellan
of
Dragonstone
while
Stannis
sat
on
Robert’s
council
in
King’s
Landing,
but
of
late
he
had
emerged
as
the
foremost
of
the
queen’s
men.
“Ser
Davos,
it
is
good
to
see
you,
as
ever,”
he
said.

“And
you,
my
lord.”

“I
made
note
of
you
this
morning
as
well.
The
false
gods
burned
with
a
merry
light,
did
they
not?”

“They
burned
brightly.”
Davos
did
not
trust
this
man,
for
all
his
courtesy.
House
Florent
had
declared
for
Renly.

“The
Lady
Melisandre
tells
us
that
sometimes
R’hllor
permits
his
faithful
servants
to
glimpse
the
future
in
flames.
It
seemed
to
me
as
I
watched
the
fire
this
morning
that
I
was
looking
at
a
dozen
beautiful
dancers,
maidens
garbed
in
yellow
silk
spinning
and
swirling
before
a
great
king.
I
think
it
was
a
true
vision,
ser.
A
glimpse
of
the
glory
that
awaits
His
Grace
after
we
take
King’s
Landing
and
the
throne
that
is
his
by
rights.”

Stannis
has
no
taste
for
such
dancing,
Davos
thought,
but
he
dared
not
offend
the
queen’s
uncle.
“I
saw
only
fire,”
he
said,
“but
the
smoke
was
making
my
eyes
water.
You
must
pardon
me,
ser,
the
king
awaits.”
He
pushed
past,
wondering
why
Ser
Axell
had
troubled
himself.
He
is
a
queen’s
man
and
I
am
the
king’s.

Stannis
sat
at
his
Painted
Table
with
Maester
Pylos
at
his
shoulder,
an
untidy
pile
of
papers
before
them.
“Ser,”
the
king
said
when
Davos
entered,
“come
have
a
look
at
this
letter.”

Obediently,
he
selected
a
paper
at
random.
“It
looks
handsome
enough,
Your
Grace,
but
I
fear
I
cannot
read
the
words.”
Davos
could
decipher
maps
and
charts
as
well
as
any,
but
letters
and
other
writings
were
beyond
his
powers.
But
my
Devan
has
learned
his
letters,
and
young
Steffon
and
Stannis
as
well.

“I’d
forgotten.”
A
furrow
of
irritation
showed
between
the
king’s
brows.
“Pylos,
read
it
to
him.”

“Your
Grace.”
The
maester
took
up
one
of
the
parchments
and
cleared
his
throat.
“All
men
know
me
for
the
trueborn
son
of
Steffon
Baratheon,
Lord
of
Storm’s
End,
by
his
lady
wife
Cassana
of
House
Estermont.
I
declare
upon
the
honor
of
my
House
that
my
beloved
brother
Robert,
our
late
king,
left
no
trueborn
issue
of
his
body,
the
boy
Joffrey,
the
boy
Tommen,
and
the
girl
Myrcella
being
abominations
born
of
incest
between
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
brother
Jaime
the
Kingslayer.
By
right
of
birth
and
blood,
I
do
this
day
lay
claim
to
the
Iron
Throne
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros.
Let
all
true
men
declare
their
loyalty.
Done
in
the
Light
of
the
Lord,
under
the
sign
and
seal
of
Stannis
of
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
His
Name,
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”
The
parchment
rustled
softly
as
Pylos
laid
it
down.

“Make
it
Ser
Jaime
the
Kingslayer
henceforth,”
Stannis
said,
frowning.
“Whatever
else
the
man
may
be,
he
remains
a
knight.
I
don’t
know
that
we
ought
to
call
Robert
my
beloved
brother
either.
He
loved
me
no
more
than
he
had
to,
nor
I
him.”

“A
harmless
courtesy,
Your
Grace,”
Pylos
said.

“A
lie.
Take
it
out.”
Stannis
turned
to
Davos.
“The
maester
tells
me
that
we
have
one
hundred
seventeen
ravens
on
hand.
I
mean
to
use
them
all.
One
hundred
seventeen
ravens
will
carry
one
hundred
seventeen
copies
of
my
letter
to
every
corner
of
the
realm,
from
the
Arbor
to
the
Wall.
Perhaps
a
hundred
will
win
through
against
storm
and
hawk
and
arrow.
If
so,
a
hundred
maesters
will
read
my
words
to
as
many
lords
in
as
many
solars
and
bedchambers…
and
then
the
letters
will
like
as
not
be
consigned
to
the
fire,
and
lips
pledged
to
silence.
These
great
lords
love
Joffrey,
or
Renly,
or
Robb
Stark.
I
am
their
rightful
king,
but
they
will
deny
me
if
they
can.
So
I
have
need
of
you.”

“I
am
yours
to
command,
my
king.
As
ever.”

Stannis
nodded.
“I
mean
for
you
to
sail
Black
Betha
north,
to
Gulltown,
the
Fingers,
the
Three
Sisters,
even
White
Harbor.
Your
son
Dale
will
go
south
in
Wraith,
past
Cape
Wrath
and
the
Broken
Arm,
all
along
the
coast
of
Dorne
as
far
as
the
Arbor.
Each
of
you
will
carry
a
chest
of
letters,
and
you
will
deliver
one
to
every
port
and
holdfast
and
fishing
village.
Nail
them
to
the
doors
of
septs
and
inns
for
every
man
to
read
who
can.”

Davos
said,
“That
will
be
few
enough.”

“Ser
Davos
speaks
truly,
Your
Grace,”
said
Maester
Pylos.
“It
would
be
better
to
have
the
letters
read
aloud.”

“Better,
but
more
dangerous,”
said
Stannis.
“These
words
will
not
be
kindly
received.”

“Give
me
knights
to
do
the
reading,”
Davos
said.
“That
will
carry
more
weight
than
anything
I
might
say.”

Stannis
seemed
well
satisfied
with
that.
“I
can
give
you
such
men,
yes.
I
have
a
hundred
knights
who
would
sooner
read
than
fight.
Be
open
where
you
can
and
stealthy
where
you
must.
Use
every
smuggler’s
trick
you
know,
the
black
sails,
the
hidden
coves,
whatever
it
requires.
If
you
run
short
of
letters,
capture
a
few
septons
and
set
them
to
copying
out
more.
I
mean
to
use
your
second
son
as
well.
He
will
take
Lady
Marya
across
the
narrow
sea,
to
Braavos
and
the
other
Free
Cities,
to
deliver
other
letters
to
the
men
who
rule
there.
The
world
will
know
of
my
claim,
and
of
Cersei’s
infamy.”

You
can
tell
them,
Davos
thought,
but
will
they
believe?
He
glanced
thoughtfully
at
Maester
Pylos.
The
king
caught
the
look.
“Maester,
perhaps
you
ought
get
to
your
writing.
We
will
need
a
great
many
letters,
and
soon.”

“As
you
will.”
Pylos
bowed,
and
took
his
leave.

The
king
waited
until
he
was
gone
before
he
said,
“What
is
it
you
would
not
say
in
the
presence
of
my
maester,
Davos?”

“My
liege,
Pylos
is
pleasant
enough,
but
I
cannot
see
the
chain
about
his
neck
without
mourning
for
Maester
Cressen.”

“Is
it
his
fault
the
old
man
died?”
Stannis
glanced
into
the
fire.
“I
never
wanted
Cressen
at
that
feast.
He’d
angered
me,
yes,
he’d
given
me
bad
counsel,
but
I
did
not
want
him
dead.
I’d
hoped
he
might
be
granted
a
few
years
of
ease
and
comfort.
He
had
earned
that
much,
at
least,
but”—he
ground
his
teeth
together—“but
he
died.
And
Pylos
serves
me
ably.”

“Pylos
is
the
least
of
it.
The
letter…
What
did
your
lords
make
of
it,
I
wonder?”

Stannis
snorted.
“Celtigar
pronounced
it
admirable.
If
I
showed
him
the
contents
of
my
privy,
he
would
declare
that
admirable
as
well.
The
others
bobbed
their
heads
up
and
down
like
a
flock
of
geese,
all
but
Velaryon,
who
said
that
steel
would
decide
the
matter,
not
words
on
parchment.
As
if
I
had
never
suspected.
The
Others
take
my
lords,
I’ll
hear
your
views.”

“Your
words
were
blunt
and
strong.”

“And
true.”

“And
true.
Yet
you
have
no
proof.
Of
this
incest.
No
more
than
you
did
a
year
ago.”

“There’s
proof
of
a
sort
at
Storm’s
End.
Robert’s
bastard.
The
one
he
fathered
on
my
wedding
night,
in
the
very
bed
they’d
made
up
for
me
and
my
bride.
Delena
was
a
Florent,
and
a
maiden
when
he
took
her,
so
Robert
acknowledged
the
babe.
Edric
Storm,
they
call
him.
He
is
said
to
be
the
very
image
of
my
brother.
If
men
were
to
see
him,
and
then
look
again
at
Joffrey
and
Tommen,
they
could
not
help
but
wonder,
I
would
think.”

“Yet
how
are
men
to
see
him,
if
he
is
at
Storm’s
End?”

Stannis
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
Painted
Table.
“It
is
a
difficulty.
One
of
many.”
He
raised
his
eyes.
“You
have
more
to
say
about
the
letter.
Well,
get
on
with
it.
I
did
not
make
you
a
knight
so
you
could
learn
to
mouth
empty
courtesies.
I
have
my
lords
for
that.
Say
what
you
would
say,
Davos.”

Davos
bowed
his
head.
“There
was
a
phrase
at
the
end.
How
did
it
go?
Done
in
the
Light
of
the
Lord…”

“Yes.”
The
king’s
jaw
was
clenched.

“Your
people
will
mislike
those
words.”

“As
you
did?”
said
Stannis
sharply.

“If
you
were
to
say
instead,
Done
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men,
or
By
the
grace
of
the
gods
old
and
new…”

“Have
you
gone
devout
on
me,
smuggler?”

“That
was
to
be
my
question
for
you,
my
liege.”

“Was
it
now?
It
sounds
as
though
you
love
my
new
god
no
more
than
you
love
my
new
maester.”

“I
do
not
know
this
Lord
of
Light,”
Davos
admitted,
“but
I
knew
the
gods
we
burned
this
morning.
The
Smith
has
kept
my
ships
safe,
while
the
Mother
has
given
me
seven
strong
sons.”

“Your
wife
has
given
you
seven
strong
sons.
Do
you
pray
to
her?
It
was
wood
we
burned
this
morning.”

“That
may
be
so,”
Davos
said,
“but
when
I
was
a
boy
in
Flea
Bottom
begging
for
a
copper,
sometimes
the
septons
would
feed
me.”

“I
feed
you
now.”

“You
have
given
me
an
honored
place
at
your
table.
And
in
return
I
give
you
truth.
Your
people
will
not
love
you
if
you
take
from
them
the
gods
they
have
always
worshiped,
and
give
them
one
whose
very
name
sounds
queer
on
their
tongues.”

Stannis
stood
abruptly.
“R’hllor.
Why
is
that
so
hard?
They
will
not
love
me,
you
say?
When
have
they
ever
loved
me?
How
can
I
lose
something
I
have
never
owned?”
He
moved
to
the
south
window
to
gaze
out
at
the
moonlit
sea.
“I
stopped
believing
in
gods
the
day
I
saw
the
Windproud
break
up
across
the
bay.
Any
gods
so
monstrous
as
to
drown
my
mother
and
father
would
never
have
my
worship,
I
vowed.
In
King’s
Landing,
the
High
Septon
would
prattle
at
me
of
how
all
justice
and
goodness
flowed
from
the
Seven,
but
all
I
ever
saw
of
either
was
made
by
men.”

“If
you
do
not
believe
in
gods—”

“—why
trouble
with
this
new
one?”
Stannis
broke
in.
“I
have
asked
myself
as
well.
I
know
little
and
care
less
of
gods,
but
the
red
priestess
has
power.”

Yes,
but
what
sort
of
power?
“Cressen
had
wisdom.”

“I
trusted
in
his
wisdom
and
your
wiles,
and
what
did
they
avail
me,
smuggler?
The
storm
lords
sent
you
packing.
I
went
to
them
a
beggar
and
they
laughed
at
me.
Well,
there
will
be
no
more
begging,
and
no
more
laughing
either.
The
Iron
Throne
is
mine
by
rights,
but
how
am
I
to
take
it?
There
are
four
kings
in
the
realm,
and
three
of
them
have
more
men
and
more
gold
than
I
do.
I
have
ships…
and
I
have
her.
The
red
woman.
Half
my
knights
are
afraid
even
to
say
her
name,
did
you
know?
If
she
can
do
nothing
else,
a
sorceress
who
can
inspire
such
dread
in
grown
men
is
not
to
be
despised.
A
frightened
man
is
a
beaten
man.
And
perhaps
she
can
do
more.
I
mean
to
find
out.

“When
I
was
a
lad
I
found
an
injured
goshawk
and
nursed
her
back
to
health.
Proudwing,
I
named
her.
She
would
perch
on
my
shoulder
and
flutter
from
room
to
room
after
me
and
take
food
from
my
hand,
but
she
would
not
soar.
Time
and
again
I
would
take
her
hawking,
but
she
never
flew
higher
than
the
treetops.
Robert
called
her
Weakwing.
He
owned
a
gyrfalcon
named
Thunderclap
who
never
missed
her
strike.
One
day
our
great-uncle
Ser
Harbert
told
me
to
try
a
different
bird.
I
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
with
Proudwing,
he
said,
and
he
was
right.”
Stannis
Baratheon
turned
away
from
the
window,
and
the
ghosts
who
moved
upon
the
southern
sea.
“The
Seven
have
never
brought
me
so
much
as
a
sparrow.
It
is
time
I
tried
another
hawk,
Davos.
A
red
hawk.”





THEON

There
was
no
safe
anchorage
at
Pyke,
but
Theon
Greyjoy
wished
to
look
on
his
father’s
castle
from
the
sea,
to
see
it
as
he
had
seen
it
last,
ten
years
before,
when
Robert
Baratheon’s
war
galley
had
borne
him
away
to
be
a
ward
of
Eddard
Stark.
On
that
day
he
had
stood
beside
the
rail,
listening
to
the
stroke
of
the
oars
and
the
pounding
of
the
master’s
drum
while
he
watched
Pyke
dwindle
in
the
distance.
Now
he
wanted
to
see
it
grow
larger,
to
rise
from
the
sea
before
him.

Obedient
to
his
wishes,
the
Myraham
beat
her
way
past
the
point
with
her
sails
snapping
and
her
captain
cursing
the
wind
and
his
crew
and
the
follies
of
highborn
lordlings.
Theon
drew
the
hood
of
his
cloak
up
against
the
spray,
and
looked
for
home.

The
shore
was
all
sharp
rocks
and
glowering
cliffs,
and
the
castle
seemed
one
with
the
rest,
its
towers
and
walls
and
bridges
quarried
from
the
same
grey-black
stone,
wet
by
the
same
salt
waves,
festooned
with
the
same
spreading
patches
of
dark
green
lichen,
speckled
by
the
droppings
of
the
same
seabirds.
The
point
of
land
on
which
the
Greyjoys
had
raised
their
fortress
had
once
thrust
like
a
sword
into
the
bowels
of
the
ocean,
but
the
waves
had
hammered
at
it
day
and
night
until
the
land
broke
and
shattered,
thousands
of
years
past.
All
that
remained
were
three
bare
and
barren
islands
and
a
dozen
towering
stacks
of
rock
that
rose
from
the
water
like
the
pillars
of
some
sea
god’s
temple,
while
the
angry
waves
foamed
and
crashed
among
them.

Drear,
dark,
forbidding,
Pyke
stood
atop
those
islands
and
pillars,
almost
a
part
of
them,
its
curtain
wall
closing
off
the
headland
around
the
foot
of
the
great
stone
bridge
that
leapt
from
the
clifftop
to
the
largest
islet,
dominated
by
the
massive
bulk
of
the
Great
Keep.
Farther
out
were
the
Kitchen
Keep
and
the
Bloody
Keep,
each
on
its
own
island.
Towers
and
outbuildings
clung
to
the
stacks
beyond,
linked
to
each
other
by
covered
archways
when
the
pillars
stood
close,
by
long
swaying
walks
of
wood
and
rope
when
they
did
not.

The
Sea
Tower
rose
from
the
outmost
island
at
the
point
of
the
broken
sword,
the
oldest
part
of
the
castle,
round
and
tall,
the
sheer-sided
pillar
on
which
it
stood
half-eaten
through
by
the
endless
battering
of
the
waves.
The
base
of
the
tower
was
white
from
centuries
of
salt
spray,
the
upper
stories
green
from
the
lichen
that
crawled
over
it
like
a
thick
blanket,
the
jagged
crown
black
with
soot
from
its
nightly
watchfire.

Above
the
Sea
Tower
snapped
his
father’s
banner.
The
Myraham
was
too
far
off
for
Theon
to
see
more
than
the
cloth
itself,
but
he
knew
the
device
it
bore:
the
golden
kraken
of
House
Greyjoy,
arms
writhing
and
reaching
against
a
black
field.
The
banner
streamed
from
an
iron
mast,
shivering
and
twisting
as
the
wind
gusted,
like
a
bird
struggling
to
take
flight.
And
here
at
least
the
direwolf
of
Stark
did
not
fly
above,
casting
its
shadow
down
upon
the
Greyjoy
kraken.

Theon
had
never
seen
a
more
stirring
sight.
In
the
sky
behind
the
castle,
the
fine
red
tail
of
the
comet
was
visible
through
thin,
scuttling
clouds.
All
the
way
from
Riverrun
to
Seagard,
the
Mallisters
had
argued
about
its
meaning.
It
is
my
comet,
Theon
told
himself,
sliding
a
hand
into
his
fur-lined
cloak
to
touch
the
oilskin
pouch
snug
in
its
pocket.
Inside
was
the
letter
Robb
Stark
had
given
him,
paper
as
good
as
a
crown.

“Does
the
castle
look
as
you
remember
it,
milord?”
the
captain’s
daughter
asked
as
she
pressed
herself
against
his
arm.

“It
looks
smaller,”
Theon
confessed,
“though
perhaps
that
is
only
the
distance.”
The
Myraham
was
a
fat-bellied
southron
merchanter
up
from
Oldtown,
carrying
wine
and
cloth
and
seed
to
trade
for
iron
ore.
Her
captain
was
a
fat-bellied
southron
merchanter
as
well,
and
the
stony
sea
that
foamed
at
the
feet
of
the
castle
made
his
plump
lips
quiver,
so
he
stayed
well
out,
farther
than
Theon
would
have
liked.
An
ironborn
captain
in
a
longship
would
have
taken
them
along
the
cliffs
and
under
the
high
bridge
that
spanned
the
gap
between
the
gatehouse
and
the
Great
Keep,
but
this
plump
Oldtowner
had
neither
the
craft,
the
crew,
nor
the
courage
to
attempt
such
a
thing.
So
they
sailed
past
at
a
safe
distance,
and
Theon
must
content
himself
with
seeing
Pyke
from
afar.
Even
so,
the
Myraham
had
to
struggle
mightily
to
keep
itself
off
those
rocks.

“It
must
be
windy
there,”
the
captain’s
daughter
observed.

He
laughed.
“Windy
and
cold
and
damp.
A
miserable
hard
place,
in
truth…
but
my
lord
father
once
told
me
that
hard
places
breed
hard
men,
and
hard
men
rule
the
world.”

The
captain’s
face
was
as
green
as
the
sea
when
he
came
bowing
up
to
Theon
and
asked,
“May
we
make
for
port
now,
milord?”

“You
may,”
Theon
said,
a
faint
smile
playing
about
his
lips.
The
promise
of
gold
had
turned
the
Oldtowner
into
a
shameless
lickspittle.
It
would
have
been
a
much
different
voyage
if
a
longship
from
the
islands
had
been
waiting
at
Seagard
as
he’d
hoped.
Ironborn
captains
were
proud
and
willful,
and
did
not
go
in
awe
of
a
man’s
blood.
The
islands
were
too
small
for
awe,
and
a
longship
smaller
still.
If
every
captain
was
a
king
aboard
his
own
ship,
as
was
often
said,
it
was
small
wonder
they
named
the
islands
the
land
of
ten
thousand
kings.
And
when
you
have
seen
your
kings
shit
over
the
rail
and
turn
green
in
a
storm,
it
was
hard
to
bend
the
knee
and
pretend
they
were
gods.
“The
Drowned
God
makes
men,”
old
King
Urron
Redhand
had
once
said,
thousands
of
years
ago,
“but
it’s
men
who
make
crowns.”

A
longship
would
have
made
the
crossing
in
half
the
time
as
well.
The
Myraham
was
a
wallowing
tub,
if
truth
be
told,
and
he
would
not
care
to
be
aboard
her
in
a
storm.
Still,
Theon
could
not
be
too
unhappy.
He
was
here,
undrowned,
and
the
voyage
had
offered
certain
other
amusements.
He
put
an
arm
around
the
captain’s
daughter.
“Summon
me
when
we
make
Lordsport,”
he
told
her
father.
“We’ll
be
below,
in
my
cabin.”
He
led
the
girl
away
aft,
while
her
father
watched
them
go
in
sullen
silence.

The
cabin
was
the
captain’s,
in
truth,
but
it
had
been
turned
over
to
Theon’s
use
when
they
sailed
from
Seagard.
The
captain’s
daughter
had
not
been
turned
over
to
his
use,
but
she
had
come
to
his
bed
willingly
enough
all
the
same.
A
cup
of
wine,
a
few
whispers,
and
there
she
was.
The
girl
was
a
shade
plump
for
his
taste,
with
skin
as
splotchy
as
oatmeal,
but
her
breasts
filled
his
hands
nicely
and
she
had
been
a
maiden
the
first
time
he
took
her.
That
was
surprising
at
her
age,
but
Theon
found
it
diverting.
He
did
not
think
the
captain
approved,
and
that
was
amusing
as
well,
watching
the
man
struggle
to
swallow
his
outrage
while
performing
his
courtesies
to
the
high
lord,
the
rich
purse
of
gold
he’d
been
promised
never
far
from
his
thoughts.

As
Theon
shrugged
out
of
his
wet
cloak,
the
girl
said,
“You
must
be
so
happy
to
see
your
home
again,
milord.
How
many
years
have
you
been
away?
“

“Ten,
or
close
as
makes
no
matter,”
he
told
her.
“I
was
a
boy
of
ten
when
I
was
taken
to
Winterfell.
as
a
ward
of
Eddard
Stark.”
A
ward
in
name,
a
hostage
in
truth.
Half
his
days
a
hostage…
but
no
longer.
His
life
was
his
own
again,
and
nowhere
a
Stark
to
be
seen.
He
drew
the
captain’s
daughter
close
and
kissed
her
on
her
ear.
“Take
off
your
cloak.”

She
dropped
her
eyes,
suddenly
shy,
but
did
as
he
bid
her.
When
the
heavy
garment,
sodden
with
spray,
fell
from
her
shoulders
to
the
deck,
she
gave
him
a
little
bow
and
smiled
anxiously.
She
looked
rather
stupid
when
she
smiled,
but
he
had
never
required
a
woman
to
be
clever.
“Come
here,”
he
told
her.

She
did.
“I
have
never
seen
the
Iron
Islands.”

“Count
yourself
fortunate.”
Theon
stroked
her
hair.
it
was
fine
and
dark,
though
the
wind
had
made
a
tangle
of
it.
“The
islands
are
stern
and
stony
places,
scant
of
comfort
and
bleak
of
prospect.
Death
is
never
far
here,
and
life
is
mean
and
meager.
Men
spend
their
nights
drinking
ale
and
arguing
over
whose
lot
is
worse,
the
fisherfolk
who
fight
the
sea
or
the
farmers
who
try
and
scratch
a
crop
from
the
poor
thin
soil.
If
truth
be
told,
the
miners
have
it
worse
than
either,
breaking
their
backs
down
in
the
dark,
and
for
what?
Iron,
lead,
tin,
those
are
our
treasures.
Small
wonder
the
ironmen
of
old
turned
to
raiding.”

The
stupid
girl
did
not
seem
to
be
listening.
“I
could
go
ashore
with
you,”
she
said.
“I
would,
if
it
please
you…”

“You
could
go
ashore,”
Theon
agreed,
squeezing
her
breast,
“but
not
with
me,
I
fear.”

“I’d
work
in
your
castle,
milord.
I
can
clean
fish
and
bake
bread
and
churn
butter.
Father
says
my
peppercrab
stew
is
the
best
he’s
ever
tasted.
You
could
find
me
a
place
in
your
kitchens
and
I
could
make
you
peppercrab
stew.”

“And
warm
my
bed
by
night?”
He
reached
for
the
laces
of
her
bodice
and
began
to
undo
them,
his
fingers
deft
and
practiced.
“Once
I
might
have
carried
you
home
as
a
prize,
and
kept
you
to
wife
whether
you
willed
it
or
no.
The
ironmen
of
old
did
such
things.
A
man
had
his
rock
wife,
his
true
bride,
ironborn
like
himself,
but
he
had
his
salt
wives
too,
women
captured
on
raids.”

The
girl’s
eyes
grew
wide,
and
not
because
he
had
bared
her
breasts.
“I
would
be
your
salt
wife,
milord.”

“I
fear
those
days
are
gone.”
Theon’s
finger
circled
one
heavy
teat,
spiraling
in
toward
the
fat
brown
nipple.
“No
longer
may
we
ride
the
wind
with
fire
and
sword,
taking
what
we
want.
Now
we
scratch
in
the
ground
and
toss
lines
in
the
sea
like
other
men,
and
count
ourselves
lucky
if
we
have
salt
cod
and
porridge
enough
to
get
us
through
a
winter.”
He
took
her
nipple
in
his
mouth,
and
bit
it
until
she
gasped.

“You
can
put
it
in
me
again,
if
it
please
you,”
she
whispered
in
his
ear
as
he
sucked.

When
he
raised
his
head
from
her
breast,
the
skin
was
dark
red
where
his
mouth
had
marked
her.
“It
would
please
me
to
teach
you
something
new.
Unlace
me
and
pleasure
me
with
your
mouth.”

“With
my
mouth?”

His
thumb
brushed
lightly
over
her
full
lips.
“It’s
what
those
lips
were
made
for,
sweetling.
If
you
were
my
salt
wife,
you’d
do
as
I
command.”

She
was
timid
at
first,
but
learned
quickly
for
such
a
stupid
girl,
which
pleased
him.
Her
mouth
was
as
wet
and
sweet
as
her
cunt,
and
this
way
he
did
not
have
to
listen
to
her
mindless
prattle.
Once
I
would
have
kept
her
as
a
salt
wife
in
truth,
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
slid
his
fingers
through
her
tangled
hair.
Once.
When
we
still
kept
the
Old
Way,
lived
by
the
axe
instead
of
the
pick,
taking
what
we
would,
be
it
wealth,
women,
or
glory.
In
those
days,
the
ironborn
did
not
work
mines;
that
was
labor
for
the
captives
brought
back
from
the
hostings,
and
so
too
the
sorry
business
of
farming
and
tending
goats
and
sheep.
War
was
an
ironman’s
proper
trade.
The
Drowned
God
had
made
them
to
reave
and
rape,
to
carve
out
kingdoms
and
write
their
names
in
fire
and
blood
and
song.

Aegon
the
Dragon
had
destroyed
the
Old
Way
when
he
burned
Black
Harren,
gave
Harren’s
kingdom
back
to
the
weakling
rivermen,
and
reduced
the
Iron
Islands
to
an
insignificant
backwater
of
a
much
greater
realm.
Yet
the
old
red
tales
were
still
told
around
driftwood
fires
and
smoky
hearths
all
across
the
islands,
even
behind
the
high
stone
halls
of
Pyke.
Theon’s
father
numbered
among
his
titles
the
style
of
Lord
Reaper,
and
the
Greyjoy
words
boasted
that
We
Do
Not
Sow.

It
had
been
to
bring
back
the
Old
Way
more
than
for
the
empty
vanity
of
a
crown
that
Lord
Balon
had
staged
his
great
rebellion.
Robert
Baratheon
had
written
a
bloody
end
to
that
hope,
with
the
help
of
his
friend
Eddard
Stark,
but
both
men
were
dead
now.
Mere
boys
ruled
in
their
stead,
and
the
realm
that
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
forged
was
smashed
and
sundered.
This
is
the
season,
Theon
thought
as
the
captain’s
daughter
slid
her
lips
up
and
down
the
length
of
him,
the
season,
the
year,
the
day,
and
I
am
the
man.
He
smiled
crookedly,
wondering
what
his
father
would
say
when
Theon
told
him
that
he,
the
last-born,
babe
and
hostage,
he
had
succeeded
where
Lord
Balon
himself
had
failed.

His
climax
came
on
him
sudden
as
a
storm,
and
he
filled
the
girl’s
mouth
with
his
seed.
Startled,
she
tried
to
pull
away,
but
Theon
held
her
tight
by
the
hair.
Afterward,
she
crawled
up
beside
him.
“Did
I
please
milord?”

“Well
enough,”
he
told
her.

“It
tasted
salty,”
she
murmured.

“Like
the
sea?”

She
nodded.
“I
have
always
loved
the
sea,
milord.”

“As
I
have,”
he
said,
rolling
her
nipple
idly
between
his
fingers.
It
was
true.
The
sea
meant
freedom
to
the
men
of
the
Iron
Islands.
He
had
forgotten
that
until
the
Myraham
had
raised
sail
at
Seagard.
The
sounds
brought
old
feelings
back;
the
creak
of
wood
and
rope,
the
captain’s
shouted
commands,
the
snap
of
the
sails
as
the
wind
filled
them,
each
as
familiar
as
the
beating
of
his
own
heart,
and
as
comforting.
I
must
remember
this,
Theon
vowed
to
himself.
I
must
never
go
far
from
the
sea
again.

“Take
me
with
you,
milord,”
the
captain’s
daughter
begged.
“I
don’t
need
to
go
to
your
castle.
I
can
stay
in
some
town,
and
be
your
salt
wife.”
She
reached
out
to
stroke
his
cheek.

Theon
Greyjoy
pushed
her
hand
aside
and
climbed
off
the
bunk.
“My
place
is
Pyke,
and
yours
is
on
this
ship.”

“I
can’t
stay
here
now.”

He
laced
up
his
breeches.
“Why
not?”

“My
father,”
she
told
him.
“Once
you’re
gone,
he’ll
punish
me,
milord.
He’ll
call
me
names
and
hit
me.”

Theon
swept
his
cloak
off
its
peg
and
over
his
shoulders.
“Fathers
are
like
that,”
he
admitted
as
he
pinned
the
folds
with
a
silver
clasp.
“Tell
him
he
should
be
pleased.
As
many
times
as
I’ve
fucked
you,
you’re
likely
with
child.
It’s
not
every
man
who
has
the
honor
of
raising
a
king’s
bastard.”
She
looked
at
him
stupidly,
so
he
left
her
there.

The
Myraham
was
rounding
a
wooded
point.
Below
the
pine-clad
bluffs,
a
dozen
fishing
boats
were
pulling
in
their
nets.
The
big
cog
stayed
well
out
from
them,
tacking.
Theon
moved
to
the
bow
for
a
better
view.
He
saw
the
castle
first,
the
stronghold
of
the
Botleys.
When
he
was
a
boy
it
had
been
timber
and
wattle,
but
Robert
Baratheon
had
razed
that
structure
to
the
ground.
Lord
Sawane
had
rebuilt
in
stone,
for
now
a
small
square
keep
crowned
the
hill.
Pale
green
flags
drooped
from
the
squat
corner
towers,
each
emblazoned
with
a
shoal
of
silvery
fish.

Beneath
the
dubious
protection
of
the
fish-ridden
little
castle
lay
the
village
of
Lordsport,
its
harbor
aswarm
with
ships.
When
last
he’d
seen
Lordsport,
it
had
been
a
smoking
wasteland,
the
skeletons
of
burnt
longships
and
smashed
galleys
littering
the
stony
shore
like
the
bones
of
dead
leviathans,
the
houses
no
more
than
broken
walls
and
cold
ashes.
After
ten
years,
few
traces
of
the
war
remained.
The
smallfolk
had
built
new
hovels
with
the
stones
of
the
old,
and
cut
fresh
sod
for
their
roofs.
A
new
inn
had
risen
beside
the
landing,
twice
the
size
of
the
old
one,
with
a
lower
story
of
cut
stone
and
two
upper
stories
of
timber.
The
sept
beyond
had
never
been
rebuilt,
though;
only
a
seven-sided
foundation
remained
where
it
had
stood.
Robert
Baratheon’s
fury
had
soured
the
ironmen’s
taste
for
the
new
gods,
it
would
seem.

Theon
was
more
interested
in
ships
than
gods.
Among
the
masts
of
countless
fishing
boats,
he
spied
a
Tyroshi
trading
galley
off-loading
beside
a
lumbering
Ibbenese
cog
with
her
black-tarred
hull.
A
great
number
of
longships,
fifty
or
sixty
at
the
least,
stood
out
to
sea
or
lay
beached
on
the
pebbled
shore
to
the
north.
Some
of
the
sails
bore
devices
from
the
other
islands;
the
blood
moon
of
Wynch,
Lord
Goodbrother’s
banded
black
warhorn,
Harlaw’s
silver
scythe.
Theon
searched
for
his
uncle
Euron’s
Silence.
Of
that
lean
and
terrible
red
ship
he
saw
no
sign,
but
his
father’s
Great
Kraken
was
there,
her
bow
ornamented
with
a
grey
iron
ram
in
the
shape
of
its
namesake.

Had
Lord
Balon
anticipated
him
and
called
the
Greyjoy
banners?
His
hand
went
inside
his
cloak
again,
to
the
oilskin
pouch.
No
one
knew
of
his
letter
but
Robb
Stark;
they
were
no
fools,
to
entrust
their
secrets
to
a
bird.
Still,
Lord
Balon
was
no
fool
either.
He
might
well
have
guessed
why
his
son
was
coming
home
at
long
last,
and
acted
accordingly.

The
thought
did
not
please
him.
His
father’s
war
was
long
done,
and
lost.
This
was
Theon’s
hour—his
plan,
his
glory,
and
in
time
his
crown.
Yet
if
the
longships
are
hosting…

It
might
be
only
a
caution,
now
that
he
thought
on
it.
A
defensive
move,
lest
the
war
spill
out
across
the
sea.
Old
men
were
cautious
by
nature.
His
father
was
old
now,
and
so
too
his
uncle
Victarion,
who
commanded
the
Iron
Fleet.
His
uncle
Euron
was
a
different
song,
to
be
sure,
but
the
Silence
did
not
seem
to
be
in
port.
It’s
all
for
the
good,
Theon
told
himself.
This
way,
I
shall
be
able
to
strike
all
the
more
quickly.

As
the
Myraham
made
her
way
landward,
Theon
paced
the
deck
restlessly,
scanning
the
shore.
He
had
not
thought
to
find
Lord
Balon
himself
at
quayside,
but
surely
his
father
would
have
sent
someone
to
meet
him.
Sylas
Sourmouth
the
steward,
Lord
Botley,
perhaps
even
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.
It
would
be
good
to
look
on
Dagmer’s
hideous
old
face
again.
It
was
not
as
though
they
had
no
word
of
his
arrival.
Robb
had
sent
ravens
from
Riverrun,
and
when
they’d
found
no
longship
at
Seagard,
Jason
Mallister
had
sent
his
own
birds
to
Pyke,
supposing
that
Robb’s
were
lost.

Yet
he
saw
no
familiar
faces,
no
honor
guard
waiting
to
escort
him
from
Lordsport
to
Pyke,
only
smallfolk
going
about
their
small
business.
Shorehands
rolled
casks
of
wine
off
the
Tyroshi
trader,
fisherfolk
cried
the
day’s
catch,
children
ran
and
played.
A
priest
in
the
seawater
robes
of
the
Drowned
God
was
leading
a
pair
of
horses
along
the
pebbled
shore,
while
above
him
a
slattern
leaned
out
a
window
in
the
inn,
calling
out
to
some
passing
Ibbenese
sailors.

A
handful
of
Lordsport
merchants
had
gathered
to
meet
the
ship.
They
shouted
questions
as
the
Myraham
was
tying
up.
“We’re
out
of
Oldtown,”
the
captain
called
down,
“bearing
apples
and
oranges,
wines
from
the
Arbor,
feathers
from
the
Summer
Isles.
I
have
pepper,
woven
leathers,
a
bolt
of
Myrish
lace,
mirrors
for
milady,
a
pair
of
Oldtown
woodharps
sweet
as
any
you
ever
heard.”
The
gangplank
descended
with
a
creak
and
a
thud.
“And
I’ve
brought
your
heir
back
to
you.”

The
Lordsport
men
gazed
on
Theon
with
blank,
bovine
eyes,
and
he
realized
that
they
did
not
know
who
he
was.
It
made
him
angry.
He
pressed
a
golden
dragon
into
the
captain’s
palm.
“Have
your
men
bring
my
things.”
Without
waiting
for
a
reply,
he
strode
down
the
gangplank.
“Innkeeper,”
he
barked,
“I
require
a
horse.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord,”
the
man
responded,
without
so
much
as
a
bow.
He
had
forgotten
how
bold
the
ironborn
could
be.
“Happens
as
I
have
one
might
do.
Where
would
you
be
riding,
m’lord?”

“Pyke.”
The
fool
still
did
not
know
him.
He
should
have
worn
his
good
doublet,
with
the
kraken
embroidered
on
the
breast.

“You’ll
want
to
be
off
soon,
to
reach
Pyke
afore
dark,”
the
innkeeper
said.
“My
boy
will
go
with
you
and
show
you
the
way.”

“Your
boy
will
not
be
needed,”
a
deep
voice
called,
“nor
your
horse.
I
shall
see
my
nephew
back
to
his
father’s
house.”

The
speaker
was
the
priest
he
had
seen
leading
the
horses
along
the
shoreline.
As
the
man
approached,
the
smallfolk
bent
the
knee,
and
Theon
heard
the
innkeeper
murmur,
“Damphair.”

Tall
and
thin,
with
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
beak
of
a
nose,
the
priest
was
garbed
in
mottled
robes
of
green
and
grey
and
blue,
the
swirling
colors
of
the
Drowned
God.
A
waterskin
hung
under
his
arm
on
a
leather
strap,
and
ropes
of
dried
seaweed
were
braided
through
his
waist-long
black
hair
and
untrimmed
beard.

A
memory
prodded
at
Theon.
in
one
of
his
rare
curt
letters,
Lord
Balon
had
written
of
his
youngest
brother
going
down
in
a
storm,
and
turning
holy
when
he
washed
up
safe
on
shore.
“Uncle
Aeron?”
he
said
doubtfully.

“Nephew
Theon,”
the
priest
replied.
“Your
lord
father
bid
me
fetch
you.
Come.”

“In
a
moment,
Uncle.”
He
turned
back
to
the
Myraham.
“My
things,”
he
commanded
the
captain.

A
sailor
fetched
him
down
his
tall
yew
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows,
but
it
was
the
captain’s
daughter
who
brought
the
pack
with
his
good
clothing.
“Milord.”
Her
eyes
were
red.
When
he
took
the
pack,
she
made
as
if
to
embrace
him,
there
in
front
of
her
own
father
and
his
priestly
uncle
and
half
the
island.

Theon
turned
deftly
aside.
“You
have
my
thanks.”

“Please,”
she
said,
“I
do
love
you
well,
milord.”

“I
must
go.”
He
hurried
after
his
uncle,
who
was
already
well
down
the
pier.
Theon
caught
him
with
a
dozen
long
strides.
“I
had
not
looked
for
you,
Uncle.
After
ten
years,
I
thought
perhaps
my
lord
father
and
lady
mother
might
come
themselves,
or
send
Dagmer
with
an
honor
guard.”

“It
is
not
for
you
to
question
the
commands
of
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke.”
The
priest’s
manner
was
chilly,
most
unlike
the
man
Theon
remembered.
Aeron
Greyjoy
had
been
the
most
amiable
of
his
uncles,
feckless
and
quick
to
laugh,
fond
of
songs,
ale,
and
women.
“As
to
Dagmer,
the
Cleftjaw
is
gone
to
Old
Wyk
at
your
father’s
behest,
to
roust
the
Stonehouses
and
the
Drumms.”

“To
what
purpose?
Why
are
the
longships
hosting?”

“Why
have
longships
ever
hosted?”
His
uncle
had
left
the
horses
tied
up
in
front
of
the
waterside
inn.
When
they
reached
them,
he
turned
to
Theon.
“Tell
me
true,
nephew.
Do
you
pray
to
the
wolf
gods
now?”

Theon
seldom
prayed
at
all,
but
that
was
not
something
you
confessed
to
a
priest,
even
your
father’s
own
brother.
“Ned
Stark
prayed
to
a
tree.
No,
I
care
nothing
for
Stark’s
gods.”

“Good.
Kneel.”

The
ground
was
all
stones
and
mud.
“Uncle,
I—”

“Kneel.
Or
are
you
too
proud
now,
a
lordling
of
the
green
lands
come
among
us?”

Theon
knelt.
He
had
a
purpose
here,
and
might
need
Aeron’s
help
to
achieve
it.
A
crown
was
worth
a
little
mud
and
horseshit
on
his
breeches,
he
supposed.

“Bow
your
head.”
Lifting
the
skin,
his
uncle
pulled
the
cork
and
directed
a
thin
stream
of
seawater
down
upon
Theon’s
head.
It
drenched
his
hair
and
ran
over
his
forehead
into
his
eyes.
Sheets
washed
down
his
cheeks,
and
a
finger
crept
under
his
cloak
and
doublet
and
down
his
back,
a
cold
rivulet
along
his
spine.
The
salt
made
his
eyes
burn,
until
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
cry
out.
He
could
taste
the
ocean
on
his
lips.
“Let
Theon
your
servant
be
born
again
from
the
sea,
as
you
were,”
Aeron
Greyjoy
intoned.
“Bless
him
with
salt,
bless
him
with
stone,
bless
him
with
steel.
Nephew,
do
you
still
know
the
words?”

“What
is
dead
may
never
die,”
Theon
said,
remembering.

“What
is
dead
may
never
die,”
his
uncle
echoed,
“but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger.
Stand.”

Theon
stood,
blinking
back
tears
from
the
salt
in
his
eyes.
Wordless,
his
uncle
corked
the
waterskin,
untied
his
horse,
and
mounted.
Theon
did
the
same.
They
set
off
together,
leaving
the
inn
and
the
harbor
behind
them,
up
past
the
castle
of
Lord
Botley
into
the
stony
hills.
The
priest
ventured
no
further
word.

“I
have
been
half
my
life
away
from
home,”
Theon
ventured
at
last.
“Will
I
find
the
islands
changed?”

“Men
fish
the
sea,
dig
in
the
earth,
and
die.
Women
birth
children
in
blood
and
pain,
and
die.
Night
follows
day.
The
winds
and
tides
remain.
The
islands
are
as
our
god
made
them.”

Gods,
he
has
grown
grim,
Theon
thought.
“Will
I
find
my
sister
and
my
lady
mother
at
Pyke?”

“You
will
not.
Your
mother
dwells
on
Harlaw,
with
her
own
sister.
It
is
less
raw
there,
and
her
cough
troubles
her.
Your
sister
has
taken
Black
Wind
to
Great
Wyk,
with
messages
from
your
lord
father.
She
will
return
e’er
long,
you
may
be
sure.”

Theon
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
Black
Wind
was
Asha’s
longship.
He
had
not
seen
his
sister
in
ten
years,
but
that
much
he
knew
of
her.
Odd
that
she
would
call
it
that,
when
Robb
Stark
had
a
wolf
named
Grey
Wind.
“Stark
is
grey
and
Greyjoy’s
black,”
he
murmured,
smiling,
“but
it
seems
we’re
both
windy.”

The
priest
had
nothing
to
say
to
that.

“And
what
of
you,
Uncle?”
Theon
asked.
“You
were
no
priest
when
I
was
taken
from
Pyke.
I
remember
how
you
would
sing
the
old
reaving
songs
standing
on
the
table
with
a
horn
of
ale
in
hand.”

“Young
I
was,
and
vain,”
Aeron
Greyjoy
said,
“but
the
sea
washed
my
follies
and
my
vanities
away.
That
man
drowned,
nephew.
His
lungs
filled
with
seawater,
and
the
fish
ate
the
scales
off
his
eyes.
When
I
rose
again,
I
saw
clearly.”

He
is
as
mad
as
he
is
sour.
Theon
had
liked
what
he
remembered
of
the
old
Aeron
Greyjoy.
“Uncle,
why
has
my
father
called
his
swords
and
sails?”

“Doubtless
he
will
tell
you
at
Pyke.”

“I
would
know
his
plans
now.”

“From
me,
you
shall
not.
We
are
commanded
not
to
speak
of
this
to
any
man.”

“Even
to
me?”
Theon’s
anger
flared.
He’d
led
men
in
war,
hunted
with
a
king,
won
honor
in
tourney
melees,
ridden
with
Brynden
Blackfish
and
Greatjon
Umber,
fought
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
bedded
more
girls
than
he
could
name,
and
yet
this
uncle
was
treating
him
as
though
he
were
still
a
child
of
ten.
“If
my
father
makes
plans
for
war,
I
must
know
of
them.
I
am
not
‘any
man,’
I
am
heir
to
Pyke
and
the
Iron
Islands.”

“As
to
that,”
his
uncle
said,
“we
shall
see.”

The
words
were
a
slap
in
the
face.
“We
shall
see?
My
brothers
are
both
dead.
I
am
my
lord
father’s
only
living
son.”

“Your
sister
lives.”

Asha,
he
thought,
confounded.
She
was
three
years
older
than
Theon,
yet
still…“A
woman
may
inherit
only
if
there
is
no
male
heir
in
the
direct
line,”
he
insisted
loudly.
“I
will
not
be
cheated
of
my
rights,
I
warn
you.”

His
uncle
grunted.
“You
warn
a
servant
of
the
Drowned
God,
boy?
You
have
forgotten
more
than
you
know.
And
you
are
a
great
fool
if
you
believe
your
lord
father
will
ever
hand
these
holy
islands
over
to
a
Stark.
Now
be
silent.
The
ride
is
long
enough
without
your
magpie
chatterings.”

Theon
held
his
tongue,
though
not
without
struggle.
So
that
is
the
way
of
it,
he
thought.
As
if
ten
years
in
Winterfell
could
make
a
Stark.
Lord
Eddard
had
raised
him
among
his
own
children,
but
Theon
had
never
been
one
of
them.
The
whole
castle,
from
Lady
Stark
to
the
lowliest
kitchen
scullion,
knew
he
was
hostage
to
his
father’s
good
behavior,
and
treated
him
accordingly.
Even
the
bastard
Jon
Snow
had
been
accorded
more
honor
than
he
had.

Lord
Eddard
had
tried
to
play
the
father
from
time
to
time,
but
to
Theon
he
had
always
remained
the
man
who’d
brought
blood
and
fire
to
Pyke
and
taken
him
from
his
home.
As
a
boy,
he
had
lived
in
fear
of
Stark’s
stern
face
and
great
dark
sword.
His
wife
was,
if
anything,
even
more
distant
and
suspicious.

As
for
their
children,
the
younger
ones
had
been
mewling
babes
for
most
of
his
years
at
Winterfell.
Only
Robb
and
his
baseborn
half
brother
Jon
Snow
had
been
old
enough
to
be
worth
his
notice.
The
bastard
was
a
sullen
boy,
quick
to
sense
a
slight,
jealous
of
Theon’s
high
birth
and
Robb’s
regard
for
him.
For
Robb
himself,
Theon
did
have
a
certain
affection,
as
for
a
younger
brother…
but
it
would
be
best
not
to
mention
that.
In
Pyke,
it
would
seem,
the
old
wars
were
still
being
fought.
That
ought
not
surprise
him.
The
Iron
Islands
lived
in
the
past;
the
present
was
too
hard
and
bitter
to
be
borne.
Besides,
his
father
and
uncles
were
old,
and
the
old
lords
were
like
that;
they
took
their
dusty
feuds
to
the
grave,
forgetting
nothing
and
forgiving
less.

It
had
been
the
same
with
the
Mallisters,
his
companions
on
the
ride
from
Riverrun
to
Seagard.
Patrek
Mallister
was
not
too
ill
a
fellow;
they
shared
a
taste
for
wenches,
wine,
and
hawking.
But
when
old
Lord
Jason
saw
his
heir
growing
overly
fond
of
Theon’s
company,
he
had
taken
Patrek
aside
to
remind
him
that
Seagard
had
been
built
to
defend
the
coast
against
reavers
from
the
Iron
islands,
the
Greyjoys
of
Pyke
chief
among
them.
Their
Booming
Tower
was
named
for
its
immense
bronze
bell,
rung
of
old
to
call
the
townsfolk
and
farmhands
into
the
castle
when
longships
were
sighted
on
the
western
horizon.

“Never
mind
that
the
bell
has
been
rung
just
once
in
three
hundred
years,”
Patrek
had
told
Theon
the
day
after,
as
he
shared
his
father’s
cautions
and
a
jug
of
green-apple
wine.

“When
my
brother
stormed
Seagard,”
Theon
said.
Lord
Jason
had
slain
Rodrik
Greyjoy
under
the
walls
of
the
castle,
and
thrown
the
ironmen
back
into
the
bay.
“If
your
father
supposes
I
bear
him
some
enmity
for
that,
it’s
only
because
he
never
knew
Rodrik.”

They
had
a
laugh
over
that
as
they
raced
ahead
to
an
amorous
young
miller’s
wife
that
Patrek
knew.
Would
that
Patrek
were
with
me
now.
Mallister
or
no,
he
was
a
more
amiable
riding
companion
than
this
sour
old
priest
that
his
uncle
Aeron
had
turned
into.

The
path
they
rode
wound
up
and
up,
into
bare
and
stony
hills.
Soon
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
sea,
though
the
smell
of
salt
still
hung
sharp
in
the
damp
air.
They
kept
a
steady
plodding
pace,
past
a
shepherd’s
croft
and
the
abandoned
workings
of
a
mine.
This
new,
holy
Aeron
Greyjoy
was
not
much
for
talk.
They
rode
in
a
gloom
of
silence.
Finally
Theon
could
suffer
it
no
longer.
“Robb
Stark
is
Lord
of
Winterfell
now,”
he
said.

Aeron
rode
on.
“One
wolf
is
much
like
the
other.”

“Robb
has
broken
fealty
with
the
Iron
Throne
and
crowned
himself
King
in
the
North.
There’s
war.”

“The
maester’s
ravens
fly
over
salt
as
soon
as
rock.
This
news
is
old
and
cold.”

“It
means
a
new
day,
Uncle.”

“Every
morning
brings
a
new
day,
much
like
the
old.”

“In
Riverrun,
they
would
tell
you
different.
They
say
the
red
comet
is
a
herald
of
a
new
age.
A
messenger
from
the
gods.”

“A
sign
it
is,”
the
priest
agreed,
“but
from
our
god,
not
theirs.
A
burning
brand
it
is,
such
as
our
people
carried
of
old.
It
is
the
flame
the
Drowned
God
brought
from
the
sea,
and
it
proclaims
a
rising
tide.
It
is
time
to
hoist
our
sails
and
go
forth
into
the
world
with
fire
and
sword,
as
he
did.”

Theon
smiled.
“I
could
not
agree
more.”

“A
man
agrees
with
god
as
a
raindrop
with
the
storm.”

This
raindrop
will
one
day
be
a
king,
old
man.
Theon
had
suffered
quite
enough
of
his
uncle’s
gloom.
He
put
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
trotted
on
ahead,
smiling.

It
was
nigh
on
sunset
when
they
reached
the
walls
of
Pyke,
a
crescent
of
dark
stone
that
ran
from
cliff
to
cliff,
with
the
gatehouse
in
the
center
and
three
square
towers
to
either
side.
Theon
could
still
make
out
the
scars
left
by
the
stones
of
Robert
Baratheon’s
catapults.
A
new
south
tower
had
risen
from
the
ruins
of
the
old,
its
stone
a
paler
shade
of
grey,
and
as
yet
unmarred
by
patches
of
lichen.
That
was
where
Robert
had
made
his
breach,
swarming
in
over
the
rubble
and
corpses
with
his
warharnmer
in
hand
and
Ned
Stark
at
his
side.
Theon
had
watched
from
the
safety
of
the
Sea
Tower,
and
sometimes
he
still
saw
the
torches
in
his
dreams,
and
heard
the
dull
thunder
of
the
collapse.

The
gates
stood
open
to
him,
the
rusted
iron
portcullis
drawn
up.
The
guards
atop
the
battlements
watched
with
strangers’
eyes
as
Theon
Greyjoy
came
home
at
last.

Beyond
the
curtain
wall
were
half
a
hundred
acres
of
headland
hard
against
the
sky
and
the
sea.
The
stables
were
here,
and
the
kennels,
and
a
scatter
of
other
outbuildings.
Sheep
and
swine
huddled
in
their
pens
while
the
castle
dogs
ran
free.
To
the
south
were
the
cliffs,
and
the
wide
stone
bridge
to
the
Great
Keep.
Theon
could
hear
the
crashing
of
waves
as
he
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
A
stableman
came
to
take
his
horse.
A
pair
of
gaunt
children
and
some
thralls
stared
at
him
with
dull
eyes,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
lord
father,
nor
anyone
else
he
recalled
from
boyhood.
A
bleak
and
bitter
homecoming,
he
thought.

The
priest
had
not
dismounted.
“Will
you
not
stay
the
night
and
share
our
meat
and
mead,
Uncle?”

“Bring
you,
I
was
told.
You
are
brought.
Now
I
return
to
our
god’s
business.”
Aeron
Greyjoy
turned
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
out
beneath
the
muddy
spikes
of
the
portcullis.

A
bentback
old
crone
in
a
shapeless
grey
dress
approached
him
warily.
“M’lord,
I
am
sent
to
show
you
to
chambers.”

“By
whose
bidding?”

“Your
lord
father,
m’lord.”

Theon
pulled
off
his
gloves.
“So
you
do
know
who
I
am.
Why
is
my
father
not
here
to
greet
me?”

“He
awaits
you
in
the
Sea
Tower,
m’lord.
When
you
are
rested
from
your
trip.”

And
I
thought
Ned
Stark
cold.
“And
who
are
you?”

“Helya,
who
keeps
this
castle
for
your
lord
father.”

“Sylas
was
steward
here.
They
called
him
Sourmouth.”
Even
now,
Theon
could
recall
the
winey
stench
of
the
old
man’s
breath.

“Dead
these
five
years,
m’lord.”

“And
what
of
Maester
Qalen,
where
is
he?”

“He
sleeps
in
the
sea.
Wendamyr
keeps
the
ravens
now.”

It
is
as
if
I
were
a
stranger
here,
Theon
thought.
Nothing
has
changed,
and
yet
everything
has
changed.
“Show
me
to
my
chambers,
woman,”
he
commanded.
Bowing
stiffly,
she
led
him
across
the
headland
to
the
bridge.
That
at
least
was
as
he
remembered;
the
ancient
stones
slick
with
spray
and
spotted
by
lichen,
the
sea
foaming
under
their
feet
like
some
great
wild
beast,
the
salt
wind
clutching
at
their
clothes.

Whenever
he’d
imagined
his
homecoming,
he
had
always
pictured
himself
returning
to
the
snug
bedchamber
in
the
Sea
Tower,
where
he’d
slept
as
a
child.
Instead
the
old
woman
led
him
to
the
Bloody
Keep.
The
halls
here
were
larger
and
better
furnished,
if
no
less
cold
nor
damp.
Theon
was
given
a
suite
of
chilly
rooms
with
ceilings
so
high
that
they
were
lost
in
gloom.
He
might
have
been
more
impressed
if
he
had
not
known
that
these
were
the
very
chambers
that
had
given
the
Bloody
Keep
its
name.
A
thousand
years
before,
the
sons
of
the
River
King
had
been
slaughtered
here,
hacked
to
bits
in
their
beds
so
that
pieces
of
their
bodies
might
be
sent
back
to
their
father
on
the
mainland.

But
Greyjoys
were
not
murdered
in
Pyke
except
once
in
a
great
while
by
their
brothers,
and
his
brothers
were
both
dead.
It
was
not
fear
of
ghosts
that
made
him
glance
about
with
distaste.
The
wall
hangings
were
green
with
mildew,
the
mattress
musty-smelling
and
sagging,
the
rushes
old
and
brittle.
Years
had
come
and
gone
since
these
chambers
had
last
been
opened.
The
damp
went
bone
deep.
“I’ll
have
a
basin
of
hot
water
and
a
fire
in
this
hearth,”
he
told
the
crone.
“See
that
they
light
braziers
in
the
other
rooms
to
drive
out
some
of
the
chill.
And
gods
be
good,
get
someone
in
here
at
once
to
change
these
rushes.”

“Yes,
m’lord.
As
you
command.”
She
fled.

After
some
time,
they
brought
the
hot
water
he
had
asked
for.
It
was
only
tepid,
and
soon
cold,
and
seawater
in
the
bargain,
but
it
served
to
wash
the
dust
of
the
long
ride
from
his
face
and
hair
and
hands.
While
two
thralls
lit
his
braziers,
Theon
stripped
off
his
travel-stained
clothing
and
dressed
to
meet
his
father.
He
chose
boots
of
supple
black
leather,
soft
lambswool
breeches
of
silvery-grey,
a
black
velvet
doublet
with
the
golden
kraken
of
the
Greyjoys
embroidered
on
the
breast.
Around
his
throat
he
fastened
a
slender
gold
chain,
around
his
waist
a
belt
of
bleached
white
leather.
He
hung
a
dirk
at
one
hip
and
a
longsword
at
the
other,
in
scabbards
striped
black-and-gold.
Drawing
the
dirk,
he
tested
its
edge
with
his
thumb,
pulled
a
whetstone
from
his
belt
pouch,
and
gave
it
a
few
licks.
He
prided
himself
on
keeping
his
weapons
sharp.
“When
I
return,
I
shall
expect
a
warm
room
and
clean
rushes,”
he
warned
the
thralls
as
he
drew
on
a
pair
of
black
gloves,
the
silk
decorated
with
a
delicate
scrollwork
tracery
in
golden
thread.

Theon
returned
to
the
Great
Keep
through
a
covered
stone
walkway,
the
echoes
of
his
footsteps
mingling
with
the
ceaseless
rumble
of
the
sea
below.
To
get
to
the
Sea
Tower
on
its
crooked
pillar,
he
had
to
cross
three
further
bridges,
each
narrower
than
the
one
before.
The
last
was
made
of
rope
and
wood,
and
the
wet
salt
wind
made
it
sway
underfoot
like
a
living
thing.
Theon’s
heart
was
in
his
mouth
by
the
time
he
was
halfway
across.
A
long
way
below,
the
waves
threw
up
tall
plumes
of
spray
as
they
crashed
against
the
rock.
As
a
boy,
he
used
to
run
across
this
bridge,
even
in
the
black
of
night.
Boys
believe
nothing
can
hurt
them,
his
doubt
whispered.
Grown
men
know
better.

The
door
was
grey
wood
studded
with
iron,
and
Theon
found
it
barred
from
the
inside.
He
hammered
on
it
with
a
fist,
and
cursed
when
a
splinter
snagged
the
fabric
of
his
glove.
The
wood
was
damp
and
moldy,
the
iron
studs
rusted.

After
a
moment
the
door
was
opened
from
within
by
a
guard
in
a
black
iron
breastplate
and
pothelm.
“You
are
the
son?”

“Out
of
my
way,
or
you’ll
learn
who
I
am.”
The
man
stood
aside.
Theon
climbed
the
twisting
steps
to
the
solar.
He
found
his
father
seated
beside
a
brazier,
beneath
a
robe
of
musty
sealskins
that
covered
him
foot
to
chin.
At
the
sound
of
boots
on
stone,
the
Lord
of
the
Iron
Islands
lifted
his
eyes
to
behold
his
last
living
son.
He
was
smaller
than
Theon
remembered
him.
And
so
gaunt.
Balon
Greyjoy
had
always
been
thin,
but
now
he
looked
as
though
the
gods
had
put
him
in
a
cauldron
and
boiled
every
spare
ounce
of
flesh
from
his
bones,
until
nothing
remained
but
hair
and
skin.
Bone
thin
and
bone
hard
he
was,
with
a
face
that
might
have
been
chipped
from
flint.
His
eyes
were
flinty
too,
black
and
sharp,
but
the
years
and
the
salt
winds
had
turned
his
hair
the
grey
of
a
winter
sea,
flecked
with
whitecaps.
Unbound,
it
hung
past
the
small
of
the
back.

“Nine
years,
is
it?”
Lord
Balon
said
at
last.

“Ten,”
Theon
answered,
pulling
off
his
torn
gloves.

“A
boy
they
took,”
his
father
said.
“What
are
you
now?”

“A
man,”
Theon
answered.
“Your
blood
and
your
heir.”

Lord
Balon
grunted.
“We
shall
see.”

“You
shall,”
Theon
promised.

“Ten
years,
you
say.
Stark
had
you
as
long
as
I.
And
now
you
come
as
his
envoy.”

“Not
his,”
Theon
said.
“Lord
Eddard
is
dead,
beheaded
by
the
Lannister
queen.”

“They
are
both
dead,
Stark
and
that
Robert
who
broke
my
walls
with
his
stones.
I
vowed
I’d
live
to
see
them
both
in
their
graves,
and
I
have.”
He
grimaced.
“Yet
the
cold
and
the
damp
still
make
my
joints
ache,
as
when
they
were
alive.
So
what
does
it
serve?”

“It
serves.”
Theon
moved
closer.
“I
bring
a
letter—”

“Did
Ned
Stark
dress
you
like
that?”
his
father
interrupted,
squinting
up
from
beneath
his
robe.
“Was
it
his
pleasure
to
garb
you
in
velvets
and
silks
and
make
you
his
own
sweet
daughter?”

Theon
felt
the
blood
rising
to
his
face.
“I
am
no
man’s
daughter.
If
you
mislike
my
garb,
I
will
change
it.”

“You
will.”
Throwing
off
the
furs,
Lord
Balon
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
not
so
tall
as
Theon
remembered.
“That
bauble
around
your
neck—was
it
bought
with
gold
or
iron?”

Theon
touched
the
gold
chain.
He
had
forgotten.
It
has
been
so
long…
In
the
Old
Way,
women
might
decorate
themselves
with
ornaments
bought
with
coin,
but
a
warrior
wore
only
the
jewelry
he
took
off
the
corpses
of
enemies
slain
by
his
own
hand.
Paying
the
iron
price,
it
was
called.

“You
blush
red
as
a
maid,
Theon.
A
question
was
asked.
Is
it
the
gold
price
you
paid,
or
the
iron?”

“The
gold,”
Theon
admitted.

His
father
slid
his
fingers
under
the
necklace
and
gave
it
a
yank
so
hard
it
was
like
to
take
Theon’s
head
off,
had
the
chain
not
snapped
first.
“My
daughter
has
taken
an
axe
for
a
lover,”
Lord
Balon
said.
“I
will
not
have
my
son
bedeck
himself
like
a
whore.”
He
dropped
the
broken
chain
onto
the
brazier,
where
it
slid
down
among
the
coals.
“It
is
as
I
feared.
The
green
lands
have
made
you
soft,
and
the
Starks
have
made
you
theirs.
“

“You’re
wrong.
Ned
Stark
was
my
gaoler,
but
my
blood
is
still
salt
and
iron.”

Lord
Balon
turned
away
to
warm
his
bony
hands
over
the
brazier.
“Yet
the
Stark
pup
sends
you
to
me
like
a
well-trained
raven,
clutching
his
little
message.”

“There
is
nothing
small
about
the
letter
I
bear,”
Theon
said,
“and
the
offer
he
makes
is
one
I
suggested
to
him.”

“This
wolf
king
heeds
your
counsel,
does
he?”
The
notion
seemed
to
amuse
Lord
Balon.

“He
heeds
me,
yes.
I’ve
hunted
with
him,
trained
with
him,
shared
meat
and
mead
with
him,
warred
at
his
side.
I
have
earned
his
trust.
He
looks
on
me
as
an
older
brother,
he—”

“No.”
His
father
jabbed
a
finger
at
his
face.
“Not
here,
not
in
Pyke,
not
in
my
hearing,
you
will
not
name
him
brother,
this
son
of
the
man
who
put
your
true
brothers
to
the
sword.
Or
have
you
forgotten
Rodrik
and
Maron,
who
were
your
own
blood?”

“I
forget
nothing.”
Ned
Stark
had
killed
neither
of
his
brothers,
in
truth.
Rodrik
had
been
slain
by
Lord
Jason
Mallister
at
Seagard,
Maron
crushed
in
the
collapse
of
the
old
south
tower…
but
Stark
would
have
done
for
them
just
as
quick
had
the
tide
of
battle
chanced
to
sweep
them
together.
“I
remember
my
brothers
very
well,”
Theon
insisted.
Chiefly
he
remembered
Rodrik’s
drunken
cuffs
and
Maron’s
cruel
japes
and
endless
lies.
“I
remember
when
my
father
was
a
king
too.”
He
took
out
Robb’s
letter
and
thrust
it
forward.
“Here.
Read
it…
Your
Grace.”

Lord
Balon
broke
the
seal
and
unfolded
the
parchment.
His
black
eyes
flicked
back
and
forth.
“So
the
boy
would
give
me
a
crown
again,”
he
said,
“and
all
I
need
do
is
destroy
his
enemies.”
His
thin
lips
twisted
in
a
smile.

“By
now
Robb
is
at
the
Golden
Tooth,”
Theon
said.
“Once
it
falls,
he’ll
be
through
the
hills
in
a
day.
Lord
Tywin’s
host
is
at
Harrenhal,
cut
off
from
the
west.
The
Kingslayer
is
a
captive
at
Riverrun.
Only
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
and
the
raw
green
levies
he’s
been
gathering
remain
to
oppose
Robb
in
the
west.
Ser
Stafford
will
put
himself
between
Robb’s
army
and
Lannisport,
which
means
the
city
will
be
undefended
when
we
descend
on
it
by
sea.
If
the
gods
are
with
us,
even
Casterly
Rock
itself
may
fall
before
the
Lannisters
so
much
as
realize
that
we
are
upon
them.”

Lord
Balon
grunted.
“Casterly
Rock
has
never
fallen.”

“Until
now.”
Theon
smiled.
And
how
sweet
that
will
be.

His
father
did
not
return
the
smile.
“So
this
is
why
Robb
Stark
sends
you
back
to
me,
after
so
long?
So
you
might
win
my
consent
to
this
plan
of
his?”

“It
is
my
plan,
not
Robb’s,”
Theon
said
proudly.
Mine,
as
the
victory
will
be
mine,
and
in
time
the
crown.
“I
will
lead
the
attack
myself,
if
it
please
you.
As
my
reward
I
would
ask
that
you
grant
me
Casterly
Rock
for
my
own
seat,
once
we
have
taken
it
from
the
Lannisters.”
With
the
Rock,
he
could
hold
Lannisport
and
the
golden
lands
of
the
west.
It
would
mean
wealth
and
power
such
as
House
Greyjoy
had
never
known.

“You
reward
yourself
handsomely
for
a
notion
and
a
few
lines
of
scribbling.”
His
father
read
the
letter
again.
“The
pup
says
nothing
about
a
reward.
Only
that
you
speak
for
him,
and
I
am
to
listen,
and
give
him
my
sails
and
swords,
and
in
return
he
will
give
me
a
crown.”
His
flinty
eyes
lifted
to
meet
his
son’s.
“He
will
give
me
a
crown,”
he
repeated,
his
voice
growing
sharp.

“A
poor
choice
of
words,
what
is
meant
is—”

“What
is
meant
is
what
is
said.
The
boy
will
give
me
a
crown.
And
what
is
given
can
be
taken
away.”
Lord
Balon
tossed
the
letter
onto
the
brazier,
atop
the
necklace.
The
parchment
curled,
blackened,
and
took
flame.

Theon
was
aghast.
“Have
you
gone
mad?”

His
father
laid
a
stinging
backhand
across
his
cheek.
“Mind
your
tongue.
You
are
not
in
Winterfell
now,
and
I
am
not
Robb
the
Boy,
that
you
should
speak
to
me
so.
I
am
the
Greyjoy,
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke,
King
of
Salt
and
Rock,
Son
of
the
Sea
Wind,
and
no
man
gives
me
a
crown.
I
pay
the
iron
price.
I
will
take
my
crown,
as
Urron
Redhand
did
five
thousand
years
ago.”

Theon
edged
backward,
away
from
the
sudden
fury
in
his
father’s
tone.
“Take
it,
then,”
he
spat,
his
cheek
still
tingling.
“Call
yourself
King
of
the
Iron
islands,
no
one
will
care…
until
the
wars
are
over,
and
the
victor
looks
about
and
spies
the
old
fool
perched
off
his
shore
with
an
iron
crown
on
his
head.”

Lord
Balon
laughed.
“Well,
at
the
least
you
are
no
craven.
No
more
than
I’m
a
fool.
Do
you
think
I
gather
my
ships
to
watch
them
rock
at
anchor?
I
mean
to
carve
out
a
kingdom
with
fire
and
sword…
but
not
from
the
west,
and
not
at
the
bidding
of
King
Robb
the
Boy.
Casterly
Rock
is
too
strong,
and
Lord
Tywin
too
cunning
by
half.
Aye,
we
might
take
Lannisport,
but
we
should
never
keep
it.
No.
I
hunger
for
a
different
plum…
not
so
juicy
sweet,
to
be
sure,
yet
it
hangs
there
ripe
and
undefended.”

Where?
Theon
might
have
asked,
but
by
then
he
knew.





DAENERYS

The
Dothraki
named
the
comet
shierak
qiya,
the
Bleeding
Star.
The
old
men
muttered
that
it
omened
ill,
but
Daenerys
Targaryen
had
seen
it
first
on
the
night
she
had
burned
Khal
Drogo,
the
night
her
dragons
had
awakened.
It
is
the
herald
of
my
coming,
she
told
herself
as
she
gazed
up
into
the
night
sky
with
wonder
in
her
heart.
The
gods
have
sent
it
to
show
me
the
way.

Yet
when
she
put
the
thought
into
words,
her
handmaid
Doreah
quailed.
“That
way
lies
the
red
lands,
Khaleesi.
A
grim
place
and
terrible,
the
riders
say.”

“The
way
the
comet
points
is
the
way
we
must
go,”
Dany
insisted…
though
in
truth,
it
was
the
only
way
open
to
her.

She
dare
not
turn
north
onto
the
vast
ocean
of
grass
they
called
the
Dothraki
sea.
The
first
khalasar
they
met
would
swallow
up
her
ragged
band,
slaying
the
warriors
and
slaving
the
rest.
The
lands
of
the
Lamb
Men
south
of
the
river
were
likewise
closed
to
them.
They
were
too
few
to
defend
themselves
even
against
that
unwarlike
folk,
and
the
Lhazareen
had
small
reason
to
love
them.
She
might
have
struck
downriver
for
the
ports
at
Meereen
and
Yunkai
and
Astapor,
but
Rakharo
warned
her
that
Pono’s
khalasar
had
ridden
that
way,
driving
thousands
of
captives
before
them
to
sell
in
the
flesh
marts
that
festered
like
open
sores
on
the
shores
of
Slaver’s
Bay.
“Why
should
I
fear
Pono?”
Dany
objected.
“He
was
Drogo’s
ko,
and
always
spoke
me
gently.”

“Ko
Pono
spoke
you
gently,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said.
“Khal
Pono
will
kill
you.
He
was
the
first
to
abandon
Drogo.
Ten
thousand
warriors
went
with
him.
You
have
a
hundred.”

No,
Dany
thought.
I
have
four.
The
rest
are
women,
old
sick
men
and
boys
whose
hair
has
never
been
braided.
“I
have
the
dragons,”
she
pointed
out.

“Hatchlings,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“One
swipe
from
an
arakh
would
put
an
end
to
them,
though
Porto
is
more
like
to
seize
them
for
himself.
Your
dragon
eggs
were
more
precious
than
rubies.
A
living
dragon
is
beyond
price.
In
all
the
world,
there
are
only
three.
Every
man
who
sees
them
will
want
them,
my
queen.”

“They
are
mine,”
she
said
fiercely.
They
had
been
born
from
her
faith
and
her
need,
given
life
by
the
deaths
of
her
husband
and
unborn
son
and
the
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
Dany
had
walked
into
the
flames
as
they
came
forth,
and
they
had
drunk
milk
from
her
swollen
breasts.
“No
man
will
take
them
from
me
while
I
live.”

“You
will
not
live
long
should
you
meet
Khal
Pono.
Nor
Khal
Jhaqo,
nor
any
of
the
others.
You
must
go
where
they
do
not.”

Dany
had
named
him
the
first
of
her
Queensguard…
and
when
Mormont’s
gruff
counsel
and
the
omens
agreed,
her
course
was
clear.
She
called
her
people
together
and
mounted
her
silver
mare.
Her
hair
had
burned
away
in
Drogo’s
pyre,
so
her
handmaids
garbed
her
in
the
skin
of
the
hrakkar
Drogo
had
slain,
the
white
lion
of
the
Dothraki
sea.
Its
fearsome
head
made
a
hood
to
cover
her
naked
scalp,
its
pelt
a
cloak
that
flowed
across
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back.
The
cream-colored
dragon
sunk
sharp
black
claws
into
the
lion’s
mane
and
coiled
its
tail
around
her
arm,
while
Ser
Jorah
took
his
accustomed
place
by
her
side.

“We
follow
the
comet,”
Dany
told
her
khalasar.
Once
it
was
said,
no
word
was
raised
against
it.
They
had
been
Drogo’s
people,
but
they
were
hers
now.
The
Unburnt,
they
called
her,
and
Mother
of
Dragons.
Her
word
was
their
law.

They
rode
by
night,
and
by
day
took
refuge
from
the
sun
beneath
their
tents.
Soon
enough
Dany
learned
the
truth
of
Doreah’s
words.
This
was
no
kindly
country.
They
left
a
trail
of
dead
and
dying
horses
behind
them
as
they
went,
for
Pono,
Jhaqo,
and
the
others
had
seized
the
best
of
Drogo’s
herds,
leaving
to
Dany
the
old
and
the
scrawny,
the
sickly
and
the
lame,
the
broken
animals
and
the
ill-tempered.
It
was
the
same
with
the
people.
They
are
not
strong,
she
told
herself,
so
I
must
be
their
strength.
I
must
show
no
fear,
no
weakness,
no
doubt.
However
frightened
my
heart,
when
they
look
upon
my
face
they
must
see
only
Drogo’s
queen.
She
felt
older
than
her
fourteen
years.
If
ever
she
had
truly
been
a
girl,
that
time
was
done.

Three
days
into
the
march,
the
first
man
died.
A
toothless
oldster
with
cloudy
blue
eyes,
he
fell
exhausted
from
his
saddle
and
could
not
rise
again.
An
hour
later
he
was
done.
Blood
flies
swarmed
about
his
corpse
and
carried
his
ill
luck
to
the
living.
“His
time
was
past,”
her
handmaid
Irri
declared.
“No
man
should
live
longer
than
his
teeth.”
The
others
agreed.
Dany
bid
them
kill
the
weakest
of
their
dying
horses,
so
the
dead
man
might
go
mounted
into
the
night
lands.

Two
nights
later,
it
was
an
infant
girl
who
perished.
Her
mother’s
anguished
wailing
lasted
all
day,
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done.
The
child
had
been
too
young
to
ride,
poor
thing.
Not
for
her
the
endless
black
grasses
of
the
night
lands;
she
must
be
born
again.

There
was
little
forage
in
the
red
waste,
and
less
water.
It
was
a
sere
and
desolate
land
of
low
hills
and
barren
windswept
plains.
The
rivers
they
crossed
were
dry
as
dead
men’s
bones.
Their
mounts
subsisted
on
the
tough
brown
devilgrass
that
grew
in
clumps
at
the
base
of
rocks
and
dead
trees.
Dany
sent
outriders
ranging
ahead
of
the
column,
but
they
found
neither
wells
nor
springs,
only
bitter
pools,
shallow
and
stagnant,
shrinking
in
the
hot
sun.
The
deeper
they
rode
into
the
waste,
the
smaller
the
pools
became,
while
the
distance
between
them
grew.
If
there
were
gods
in
this
trackless
wilderness
of
stone
and
sand
and
red
clay,
they
were
hard
dry
gods,
deaf
to
prayers
for
rain.

Wine
gave
out
first,
and
soon
thereafter
the
clotted
mare’s
milk
the
horselords
loved
better
than
mead.
Then
their
stores
of
flatbread
and
dried
meat
were
exhausted
as
well.
Their
hunters
found
no
game,
and
only
the
flesh
of
their
dead
horses
filled
their
bellies.
Death
followed
death.
Weak
children,
wrinkled
old
women,
the
sick
and
the
stupid
and
the
heedless,
the
cruel
land
claimed
them
all.
Doreah
grew
gaunt
and
hollow-eyed,
and
her
soft
golden
hair
turned
brittle
as
straw.

Dany
hungered
and
thirsted
with
the
rest
of
them.
The
milk
in
her
breasts
dried
up,
her
nipples
cracked
and
bled,
and
the
flesh
fell
away
from
her
day
by
day
until
she
was
lean
and
hard
as
a
stick,
yet
it
was
her
dragons
she
feared
for.
Her
father
had
been
slain
before
she
was
born,
and
her
splendid
brother
Rhaegar
as
well.
Her
mother
had
died
bringing
her
into
the
world
while
the
storm
screamed
outside.
Gentle
Ser
Willem
Darry,
who
must
have
loved
her
after
a
fashion,
had
been
taken
by
a
wasting
sickness
when
she
was
very
young.
Her
brother
Viserys,
Khal
Drogo
who
was
her
sun-and-stars,
even
her
unborn
son,
the
gods
had
claimed
them
all.
They
will
not
have
my
dragons,
Dany
vowed.
They
will
not.

The
dragons
were
no
larger
than
the
scrawny
cats
she
had
once
seen
skulking
along
the
walls
of
Magister
Illyrio’s
estate
in
Pentos…
until
they
unfolded
their
wings.
Their
span
was
three
times
their
length,
each
wing
a
delicate
fan
of
translucent
skin,
gorgeously
colored,
stretched
taut
between
long
thin
bones.
When
you
looked
hard,
you
could
see
that
most
of
their
body
was
neck,
tail,
and
wing.
Such
little
things,
she
thought
as
she
fed
them
by
hand.
or
rather,
tried
to
feed
them,
for
the
dragons
would
not
eat.
They
would
hiss
and
spit
at
each
bloody
morsel
of
horsemeat,
steam
rising
from
their
nostrils,
yet
they
would
not
take
the
food…
until
Dany
recalled
something
Viserys
had
told
her
when
they
were
children.

Only
dragons
and
men
eat
cooked
meat,
he
had
said.

When
she
had
her
handmaids
char
the
horsemeat
black,
the
dragons
ripped
at
it
eagerly,
their
heads
striking
like
snakes.
So
long
as
the
meat
was
seared,
they
gulped
down
several
times
their
own
weight
every
day,
and
at
last
began
to
grow
larger
and
stronger.
Dany
marveled
at
the
smoothness
of
their
scales,
and
the
heat
that
poured
off
them,
so
palpable
that
on
cold
nights
their
whole
bodies
seemed
to
steam.

Each
evenfall
as
the
khalasar
set
out,
she
would
choose
a
dragon
to
ride
upon
her
shoulder.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
carried
the
others
in
a
cage
of
woven
wood
slung
between
their
mounts,
and
rode
close
behind
her,
so
Dany
was
never
out
of
their
sight.
It
was
the
only
way
to
keep
them
quiescent.

“Aegon’s
dragons
were
named
for
the
gods
of
Old
Valyria,”
she
told
her
bloodriders
one
morning
after
a
long
night’s
journey.
“Visenya’s
dragon
was
Vhagar,
Rhaenys
had
Meraxes,
and
Aegon
rode
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread.
It
was
said
that
Vhagar’s
breath
was
so
hot
that
it
could
melt
a
knight’s
armor
and
cook
the
man
inside,
that
Meraxes
swallowed
horses
whole,
and
Balerion…
his
fire
was
as
black
as
his
scales,
his
wings
so
vast
that
whole
towns
were
swallowed
up
in
their
shadow
when
he
passed
overhead.”

The
Dothraki
looked
at
her
hatchlings
uneasily.
The
largest
of
her
three
was
shiny
black,
his
scales
slashed
with
streaks
of
vivid
scarlet
to
match
his
wings
and
horns.
“Khaleesi,”
Aggo
murmured,
“there
sits
Balerion,
come
again.”

“It
may
be
as
you
say,
blood
of
my
blood,”
Dany
replied
gravely,
“but
he
shall
have
a
new
name
for
this
new
life.
I
would
name
them
all
for
those
the
gods
have
taken.
The
green
one
shall
be
Rhaegal,
for
my
valiant
brother
who
died
on
the
green
banks
of
the
Trident.
The
cream-and-gold
I
call
Viserion.
Viserys
was
cruel
and
weak
and
frightened,
yet
he
was
my
brother
still.
His
dragon
will
do
what
he
could
not.”

“And
the
black
beast?”
asked
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.

“The
black,”
she
said,
“is
Drogon.”

Yet
even
as
her
dragons
prospered,
her
khalasar
withered
and
died.
Around
them
the
land
turned
ever
more
desolate.
Even
devilgrass
grew
scant;
horses
dropped
in
their
tracks,
leaving
so
few
that
some
of
her
people
must
trudge
along
on
foot.
Doreah
took
a
fever
and
grew
worse
with
every
league
they
crossed.
Her
lips
and
hands
broke
with
blood
blisters,
her
hair
came
out
in
clumps,
and
one
evenfall
she
lacked
the
strength
to
mount
her
horse.
Jhogo
said
they
must
leave
her
or
bind
her
to
her
saddle,
but
Dany
remembered
a
night
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
when
the
Lysene
girl
had
taught
her
secrets
so
that
Drogo
might
love
her
more.
She
gave
Doreah
water
from
her
own
skin,
cooled
her
brow
with
a
damp
cloth,
and
held
her
hand
until
she
died,
shivering.
Only
then
would
she
permit
the
khalasar
to
press
on.

They
saw
no
sign
of
other
travelers.
The
Dothraki
began
to
mutter
fearfully
that
the
comet
had
led
them
to
some
hell.
Dany
went
to
Ser
Jorah
one
morning
as
they
made
camp
amidst
a
jumble
of
black
windscoured
stones.
“Are
we
lost?”
she
asked
him.
“Does
this
waste
have
no
end
to
it?”

“It
has
an
end,”
he
answered
wearily.
“I
have
seen
the
maps
the
traders
draw,
my
queen.
Few
caravans
come
this
way,
that
is
so,
yet
there
are
great
kingdoms
to
the
east,
and
cities
full
of
wonders.
Yi
Ti,
Qarth,
Asshai
by
the
Shadow…”

“Will
we
live
to
see
them?”

“I
will
not
lie
to
you.
The
way
is
harder
than
I
dared
think.”
The
knight’s
face
was
grey
and
exhausted.
The
wound
he
had
taken
to
his
hip
the
night
he
fought
Khal
Drogo’s
bloodriders
had
never
fully
healed;
she
could
see
how
he
grimaced
when
he
mounted
his
horse,
and
he
seemed
to
slump
in
his
saddle
as
they
rode.
“Perhaps
we
are
doomed
if
we
press
on…
but
I
know
for
a
certainty
that
we
are
doomed
if
we
turn
back.”

Dany
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek.
It
heartened
her
to
see
him
smile.
I
must
be
strong
for
him
as
well,
she
thought
grimly.
A
knight
he
may
be,
but
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.

The
next
pool
they
found
was
scalding
hot
and
stinking
of
brimstone,
but
their
skins
were
almost
empty.
The
Dothraki
cooled
the
water
in
jars
and
pots
and
drank
it
tepid.
The
taste
was
no
less
foul,
but
water
was
water,
and
all
of
them
thirsted.
Dany
looked
at
the
horizon
with
despair.
They
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number,
and
still
the
waste
stretched
before
them,
bleak
and
red
and
endless.
The
comet
mocks
my
hopes,
she
thought,
lifting
her
eyes
to
where
it
scored
the
sky.
Have
I
crossed
half
the
world
and
seen
the
birth
of
dragons
only
to
die
with
them
in
this
hard
hot
desert?
She
would
not
believe
it.

The
next
day,
dawn
broke
as
they
were
crossing
a
cracked
and
fissured
plain
of
hard
red
earth.
Dany
was
about
to
command
them
to
make
camp
when
her
outriders
came
racing
back
at
a
gallop.
“A
city,
Khaleesi,”
they
cried.
“A
city
pale
as
the
moon
and
lovely
as
a
maid.
An
hour’s
ride,
no
more.”

“Show
me,”
she
said.

When
the
city
appeared
before
her,
its
walls
and
towers
shimmering
white
behind
a
veil
of
heat,
it
looked
so
beautiful
that
Dany
was
certain
it
must
be
a
mirage.
“Do
you
know
what
place
this
might
be?
Ser
Jorah.”

The
exile
knight
gave
a
weary
shake
of
the
head.
“No,
my
queen.
I
have
never
traveled
this
far
east.”

The
distant
white
walls
promised
rest
and
safety,
a
chance
to
heal
and
grow
strong,
and
Dany
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
rush
toward
them.
Instead
she
turned
to
her
bloodriders.
“Blood
of
my
blood,
go
ahead
of
us
and
learn
the
name
of
this
city,
and
what
manner
of
welcome
we
should
expect.”

“Ai,
Khaleesi,”
said
Aggo.

Her
riders
were
not
long
in
returning.
Rakharo
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
From
his
medallion
belt
hung
the
great
curving
arakh
that
Dany
had
bestowed
on
him
when
she
named
him
bloodrider.
“This
city
is
dead,
Khaleesi.
Nameless
and
godless
we
found
it,
the
gates
broken,
only
wind
and
flies
moving
through
the
streets.”

Jhiqui
shuddered.
“When
the
gods
are
gone,
the
evil
ghosts
feast
by
night.
Such
places
are
best
shunned.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
Irri
agreed.

“Not
to
me.”
Dany
put
her
heels
into
her
horse
and
showed
them
the
way,
trotting
beneath
the
shattered
arch
of
an
ancient
gate
and
down
a
silent
street.
Ser
Jorah
and
her
bloodriders
followed,
and
then,
more
slowly,
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki.

How
long
the
city
had
been
deserted
she
could
not
know,
but
the
white
walls,
so
beautiful
from
afar,
were
cracked
and
crumbling
when
seen
up
close.
Inside
was
a
maze
of
narrow
crooked
alleys.
The
buildings
pressed
close,
their
facades
blank,
chalky,
windowless.
Everything
was
white,
as
if
the
people
who
lived
here
had
known
nothing
of
color.
They
rode
past
heaps
of
sun-washed
rubble
where
houses
had
fallen
in,
and
elsewhere
saw
the
faded
scars
of
fire.
At
a
place
where
six
alleys
came
together,
Dany
passed
an
empty
marble
plinth.
Dothraki
had
visited
this
place
before,
it
would
seem.
Perhaps
even
now
the
missing
statue
stood
among
the
other
stolen
gods
in
Vaes
Dothrak.
She
might
have
ridden
past
it
a
hundred
times,
never
knowing.
On
her
shoulder,
Viserion
hissed.

They
made
camp
before
the
remnants
of
a
gutted
palace,
on
a
windswept
plaza
where
devilgrass
grew
between
the
paving
stones.
Dany
sent
out
men
to
search
the
ruins.
Some
went
reluctantly,
yet
they
went…
and
one
scarred
old
man
returned
a
brief
time
later,
hopping
and
grinning,
his
hands
overflowing
with
figs.
They
were
small,
withered
things,
yet
her
people
grabbed
for
them
greedily,
jostling
and
pushing
at
each
other,
stuffing
the
fruit
into
their
cheeks
and
chewing
blissfully.

Other
searchers
returned
with
tales
of
other
fruit
trees,
hidden
behind
closed
doors
in
secret
gardens.
Aggo
showed
her
a
courtyard
overgrown
with
twisting
vines
and
tiny
green
grapes,
and
Jhogo
discovered
a
well
where
the
water
was
pure
and
cold.
Yet
they
found
bones
too,
the
skulls
of
the
unburied
dead,
bleached
and
broken.
“Ghosts,”
Irri
muttered.
“Terrible
ghosts.
We
must
not
stay
here,
Khaleesi,
this
is
their
place.”

“I
fear
no
ghosts.
Dragons
are
more
powerful
than
ghosts.”
And
figs
are
more
important.
“Go
with
Jhiqui
and
find
me
some
clean
sand
for
a
bath,
and
trouble
me
no
more
with
silly
talk.”

In
the
coolness
of
her
tent,
Dany
blackened
horsemeat
over
a
brazier
and
reflected
on
her
choices.
There
was
food
and
water
here
to
sustain
them,
and
enough
grass
for
the
horses
to
regain
their
strength.
How
pleasant
it
would
be
to
wake
every
day
in
the
same
place,
to
linger
among
shady
gardens,
eat
figs,
and
drink
cool
water,
as
much
as
she
might
desire.

When
Irri
and
Jhiqui
returned
with
pots
of
white
sand,
Dany
stripped
and
let
them
scrub
her
clean.
“Your
hair
is
coming
back,
Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
said
as
she
scraped
sand
off
her
back.
Dany
ran
a
hand
over
the
top
of
her
head,
feeling
the
new
growth.
Dothraki
men
wore
their
hair
in
long
oiled
braids,
and
cut
them
only
when
defeated.
Perhaps
I
should
do
the
same,
she
thought,
to
remind
them
that
Drogo’s
strength
lives
within
me
now.
Khal
Drogo
had
died
with
his
hair
uncut,
a
boast
few
men
could
make.

Across
the
tent,
Rhaegal
unfolded
green
wings
to
flap
and
flutter
a
half
foot
before
thumping
to
the
carpet.
When
he
landed,
his
tail
lashed
back
and
forth
in
fury,
and
he
raised
his
head
and
screamed.
If
I
had
wings,
I
would
want
to
fly
too,
Dany
thought.
The
Targaryens
of
old
had
ridden
upon
dragonback
when
they
went
to
war.
She
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
feel
like,
to
straddle
a
dragon’s
neck
and
soar
high
into
the
air.
It
would
be
like
standing
on
a
mountaintop,
only
better.
The
whole
world
would
be
spread
out
below
If
I
flew
high
enough,
I
could
even
see
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
reach
up
and
touch
the
comet.

Irri
broke
her
reverie
to
tell
her
that
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
was
outside,
awaiting
her
pleasure.
“Send
him
in,”
Dany
commanded,
sand-scrubbed
skin
tingling.
She
wrapped
herself
in
the
lionskin.
The
hrakkar
had
been
much
bigger
than
Dany,
so
the
pelt
covered
everything
that
wanted
covering.

“I’ve
brought
you
a
peach,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
kneeling.
It
was
so
small
she
could
almost
hide
it
in
her
palm,
and
overripe
too,
but
when
she
took
the
first
bite,
the
flesh
was
so
sweet
she
almost
cried.
She
ate
it
slowly,
savoring
every
mouthful,
while
Ser
Jorah
told
her
of
the
tree
it
had
been
plucked
from,
in
a
garden
near
the
western
wall.

“Fruit
and
water
and
shade,”
Dany
said,
her
cheeks
sticky
with
peach
juice.
“The
gods
were
good
to
bring
us
to
this
place.”

“We
should
rest
here
until
we
are
stronger,”
the
knight
urged.
“The
red
lands
are
not
kind
to
the
weak.”

“My
handmaids
say
there
are
ghosts
here.”

“There
are
ghosts
everywhere,”
Ser
Jorah
said
softly.
“We
carry
them
with
us
wherever
we
go.”

Yes,
she
thought.
Viserys,
Khal
Drogo,
my
son
Rhaego,
they
are
with
me
always.
“Tell
me
the
name
of
your
ghost,
Jorah.
You
know
all
of
mine.”

His
face
grew
very
still.
“Her
name
was
Lynesse.”

“Your
wife?”

“My
second
wife.”

It
pains
him
to
speak
of
her,
Dany
saw,
but
she
wanted
to
know
the
truth.
“Is
that
all
you
would
say
of
her?”
The
lion
pelt
slid
off
one
shoulder
and
she
tugged
it
back
into
place.
“Was
she
beautiful?”

“Very
beautiful.”
Ser
Jorah
lifted
his
eyes
from
her
shoulder
to
her
face.
“The
first
time
I
beheld
her,
I
thought
she
was
a
goddess
come
to
earth,
the
Maid
herself
made
flesh.
Her
birth
was
far
above
my
own.
She
was
the
youngest
daughter
of
Lord
Leyton
Hightower
of
Oldtown.
The
White
Bull
who
commanded
your
father’s
Kingsguard
was
her
great-uncle.
The
Hightowers
are
an
ancient
family,
very
rich
and
very
proud.”

“And
loyal,”
Dany
said.
“I
remember,
Viserys
said
the
Hightowers
were
among
those
who
stayed
true
to
my
father.”

“That’s
so,”
he
admitted.

“Did
your
fathers
make
the
match?”

“No,”
he
said.
“Our
marriage…
that
makes
a
long
tale
and
a
dull
one,
Your
Grace.
I
would
not
trouble
you
with
it.”

“I
have
nowhere
to
go,”
she
said.
“Please.”

“As
my
queen
commands.”
Ser
Jorah
frowned.
“My
home…
you
must
understand
that
to
understand
the
rest.
Bear
Island
is
beautiful,
but
remote.
Imagine
old
gnarled
oaks
and
tall
pines,
flowering
thornbushes,
grey
stones
bearded
with
moss,
little
creeks
running
icy
down
steep
hillsides.
The
hall
of
the
Mormonts
is
built
of
huge
logs
and
surrounded
by
an
earthen
palisade.
Aside
from
a
few
crofters,
my
people
live
along
the
coasts
and
fish
the
seas.
The
island
lies
far
to
the
north,
and
our
winters
are
more
terrible
than
you
can
imagine,
Khaleesi.

“Still,
the
island
suited
me
well
enough,
and
I
never
lacked
for
women.
I
had
my
share
of
fishwives
and
crofter’s
daughters,
before
and
after
I
was
wed.
I
married
young,
to
a
bride
of
my
father’s
choosing,
a
Glover
of
Deepwood
Motte.
Ten
years
we
were
wed,
or
near
enough
as
makes
no
matter.
She
was
a
plain-faced
woman,
but
not
unkind.
I
suppose
I
came
to
love
her
after
a
fashion,
though
our
relations
were
dutiful
rather
than
passionate.
Three
times
she
miscarried
while
trying
to
give
me
an
heir.
The
last
time
she
never
recovered.
She
died
not
long
after.”

Dany
put
her
hand
on
his
and
gave
his
fingers
a
squeeze.
“I
am
sorry
for
you,
truly.”

Ser
Jorah
nodded.
“By
then
my
father
had
taken
the
black,
so
I
was
Lord
of
Bear
Island
in
my
own
right.
I
had
no
lack
of
marriage
offers,
but
before
I
could
reach
a
decision
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
Usurper,
and
Ned
Stark
called
his
banners
to
help
his
friend
Robert.
The
final
battle
was
on
Pyke.
When
Robert’s
stonethrowers
opened
a
breach
in
King
Balon’s
wall,
a
priest
from
Myr
was
the
first
man
through,
but
I
was
not
far
behind.
For
that
I
won
my
knighthood.

“To
celebrate
his
victory,
Robert
ordained
that
a
tourney
should
be
held
outside
Lannisport.
It
was
there
I
saw
Lynesse,
a
maid
half
my
age.
She
had
come
up
from
Oldtown
with
her
father
to
see
her
brothers
joust.
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her.
In
a
fit
of
madness,
I
begged
her
favor
to
wear
in
the
tourney,
never
dreaming
she
would
grant
my
request,
yet
she
did.

“I
fight
as
well
as
any
man,
Khaleesi,
but
I
have
never
been
a
tourney
knight.
Yet
with
Lynesse’s
favor
knotted
round
my
arm,
I
was
a
different
man.
I
won
joust
after
joust.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
fell
before
me,
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce.
Ser
Ryman
Frey,
his
brother
Ser
Hosteen,
Lord
Whent,
Strongboar,
even
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard,
I
unhorsed
them
all.
In
the
last
match,
I
broke
nine
lances
against
Jaime
Lannister
to
no
result,
and
King
Robert
gave
me
the
champion’s
laurel.
I
crowned
Lynesse
queen
of
love
and
beauty,
and
that
very
night
went
to
her
father
and
asked
for
her
hand.
I
was
drunk,
as
much
on
glory
as
on
wine.
By
rights
I
should
have
gotten
a
contemptuous
refusal,
but
Lord
Leyton
accepted
my
offer.
We
were
married
there
in
Lannisport,
and
for
a
fortnight
I
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
wide
world.”

“Only
a
fortnight?”
asked
Dany.
Even
I
was
given
more
happiness
than
that,
with
Drogo
who
was
my
sun-and-stars.

“A
fortnight
was
how
long
it
took
us
to
sail
from
Lannisport
back
to
Bear
Island.
My
home
was
a
great
disappointment
to
Lynesse.
It
was
too
cold,
too
damp,
too
far
away,
my
castle
no
more
than
a
wooden
longhall.
We
had
no
masques,
no
mummer
shows,
no
balls
or
fairs.
Seasons
might
pass
without
a
singer
ever
coming
to
play
for
us,
and
there’s
not
a
goldsmith
on
the
island.
Even
meals
became
a
trial.
My
cook
knew
little
beyond
his
roasts
and
stews,
and
Lynesse
soon
lost
her
taste
for
fish
and
venison.

“I
lived
for
her
smiles,
so
I
sent
all
the
way
to
Oldtown
for
a
new
cook,
and
brought
a
harper
from
Lannisport.
Goldsmiths,
jewelers,
dressmakers,
whatever
she
wanted
I
found
for
her,
but
it
was
never
enough.
Bear
Island
is
rich
in
bears
and
trees,
and
poor
in
aught
else.
I
built
a
fine
ship
for
her
and
we
sailed
to
Lannisport
and
Oldtown
for
festivals
and
fairs,
and
once
even
to
Braavos,
where
I
borrowed
heavily
from
the
money-lenders.
It
was
as
a
tourney
champion
that
I
had
won
her
hand
and
heart,
so
I
entered
other
tourneys
for
her
sake,
but
the
magic
was
gone.
I
never
distinguished
myself
again,
and
each
defeat
meant
the
loss
of
another
charger
and
another
suit
of
jousting
armor,
which
must
needs
be
ransomed
or
replaced.
The
cost
could
not
be
borne.
Finally
I
insisted
we
return
home,
but
there
matters
soon
grew
even
worse
than
before.
I
could
no
longer
pay
the
cook
and
the
harper,
and
Lynesse
grew
wild
when
I
spoke
of
pawning
her
jewels.

“The
rest…
I
did
things
it
shames
me
to
speak
of.
For
gold.
So
Lynesse
might
keep
her
jewels,
her
harper,
and
her
cook.
In
the
end
it
cost
me
all.
When
I
heard
that
Eddard
Stark
was
coming
to
Bear
Island,
I
was
so
lost
to
honor
that
rather
than
stay
and
face
his
judgment,
I
took
her
with
me
into
exile.
Nothing
mattered
but
our
love,
I
told
myself.
We
fled
to
Lys,
where
I
sold
my
ship
for
gold
to
keep
us.”

His
voice
was
thick
with
grief,
and
Dany
was
reluctant
to
press
him
any
further,
yet
she
had
to
know
how
it
ended.
“Did
she
die
there?”
she
asked
him
gently.

“Only
to
me,”
he
said.
“In
half
a
year
my
gold
was
gone,
and
I
was
obliged
to
take
service
as
a
sellsword.
While
I
was
fighting
Braavosi
on
the
Rhoyne,
Lynesse
moved
into
the
manse
of
a
merchant
prince
named
Tregar
Ormollen.
They
say
she
is
his
chief
concubine
now,
and
even
his
wife
goes
in
fear
of
her.”

Dany
was
horrified.
“Do
you
hate
her?”

“Almost
as
much
as
I
love
her,”
Ser
Jorah
answered.
“Pray
excuse
me,
my
queen.
I
find
I
am
very
tired.”

She
gave
him
leave
to
go,
but
as
he
was
lifting
the
flap
of
her
tent,
she
could
not
stop
herself
calling
after
him
with
one
last
question.
“What
did
she
look
like,
your
Lady
Lynesse?”

Ser
Jorah
smiled
sadly.
“Why,
she
looked
a
bit
like
you,
Daenerys.”
He
bowed
low.
“Sleep
well,
my
queen.”

Dany
shivered,
and
pulled
the
lionskin
tight
about
her.
She
looked
like
me.
It
explained
much
that
she
had
not
truly
understood.
He
wants
me,
she
realized.
He
loves
me
as
he
loved
her,
not
as
a
knight
loves
his
queen
but
as
a
man
loves
a
woman.
She
tried
to
imagine
herself
in
Ser
Jorah’s
arms,
kissing
him,
pleasuring
him,
letting
him
enter
her.
It
was
no
good.
When
she
closed
her
eyes,
his
face
kept
changing
into
Drogo’s.

Khal
Drogo
had
been
her
sun-and-stars,
her
first,
and
perhaps
he
must
be
her
last.
The
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
sworn
she
should
never
bear
a
living
child,
and
what
man
would
want
a
barren
wife?
And
what
man
could
hope
to
rival
Drogo,
who
had
died
with
his
hair
uncut
and
rode
now
through
the
night
lands,
the
stars
his
khalasar?

She
had
heard
the
longing
in
Ser
Jorah’s
voice
when
he
spoke
of
his
Bear
Island.
He
can
never
have
me,
but
one
day
I
can
give
him
back
his
home
and
honor.
That
much
I
can
do
for
him.

No
ghosts
troubled
her
sleep
that
night.
She
dreamed
of
Drogo
and
the
first
ride
they
had
taken
together
on
the
night
they
were
wed.
In
the
dream
it
was
not
horses
they
rode,
but
dragons.

The
next
morn,
she
summoned
her
bloodriders.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
she
told
the
three
of
them,
“I
have
need
of
you.
Each
of
you
is
to
choose
three
horses,
the
hardiest
and
healthiest
that
remain
to
us.
Load
as
much
water
and
food
as
your
mounts
can
bear,
and
ride
forth
for
me.
Aggo
shall
strike
southwest,
Rakharo
due
south.
Jhogo,
you
are
to
follow
shierak
qiya
on
southeast.”

“What
shall
we
seek,
Khaleesi?”
asked
Jhogo.

“Whatever
there
is,”
Dany
answered.
“Seek
for
other
cities,
living
and
dead.
Seek
for
caravans
and
people.
Seek
for
rivers
and
lakes
and
the
great
salt
sea.
Find
how
far
this
waste
extends
before
us,
and
what
lies
on
the
other
side.
When
I
leave
this
place,
I
do
not
mean
to
strike
out
blind
again.
I
will
know
where
I
am
bound,
and
how
best
to
get
there.”

And
so
they
went,
the
bells
in
their
hair
ringing
softly,
while
Dany
settled
down
with
her
small
band
of
survivors
in
the
place
they
named
Vaes
Tolorro,
the
city
of
bones.
Day
followed
night
followed
day.
Women
harvested
fruit
from
the
gardens
of
the
dead.
Men
groomed
their
mounts
and
mended
saddles,
stirrups,
and
shoes.
Children
wandered
the
twisty
alleys
and
found
old
bronze
coins
and
bits
of
purple
glass
and
stone
flagons
with
handles
carved
like
snakes.
One
woman
was
stung
by
a
red
scorpion,
but
hers
was
the
only
death.
The
horses
began
to
put
on
some
flesh.
Dany
tended
Ser
Jorah’s
wound
herself,
and
it
began
to
heal.

Rakharo
was
the
first
to
return.
Due
south
the
red
waste
stretched
on
and
on,
he
reported,
until
it
ended
on
a
bleak
shore
beside
the
poison
water.
Between
here
and
there
lay
only
swirling
sand,
wind-scoured
rocks,
and
plants
bristly
with
sharp
thorns.
He
had
passed
the
bones
of
a
dragon,
he
swore,
so
immense
that
he
had
ridden
his
horse
through
its
great
black
jaws.
Other
than
that,
he
had
seen
nothing.

Dany
gave
him
charge
of
a
dozen
of
her
strongest
men,
and
set
them
to
pulling
up
the
plaza
to
get
to
the
earth
beneath.
If
devilgrass
could
grow
between
the
paving
stones,
other
grasses
would
grow
when
the
stones
were
gone.
They
had
wells
enough,
no
lack
of
water.
Given
seed,
they
could
make
the
plaza
bloom.

Aggo
was
back
next.
The
southwest
was
barren
and
burnt,
he
swore.
He
had
found
the
ruins
of
two
more
cities,
smaller
than
Vaes
Tolorro
but
otherwise
the
same.
One
was
warded
by
a
ring
of
skulls
mounted
on
rusted
iron
spears,
so
he
dared
not
enter,
but
he
had
explored
the
second
for
as
long
as
he
could.
He
showed
Dany
an
iron
bracelet
he
had
found,
set
with
a
uncut
fire
opal
the
size
of
her
thumb.
There
were
scrolls
as
well,
but
they
were
dry
and
crumbling
and
Aggo
had
left
them
where
they
lay.

Dany
thanked
him
and
told
him
to
see
to
the
repair
of
the
gates.
If
enemies
had
crossed
the
waste
to
destroy
these
cities
in
ancient
days,
they
might
well
come
again.
“If
so,
we
must
be
ready,”
she
declared.

Jhogo
was
gone
so
long
that
Dany
feared
him
lost,
but
finally
when
they
had
all
but
ceased
to
look
for
him,
he
came
riding
up
from
the
southeast.
One
of
the
guards
that
Aggo
had
posted
saw
him
first
and
gave
a
shout,
and
Dany
rushed
to
the
walls
to
see
for
herself.
It
was
true.
Jhogo
came,
yet
not
alone.
Behind
him
rode
three
queerly
garbed
strangers
atop
ugly
humped
creatures
that
dwarfed
any
horse.

They
drew
rein
before
the
city
gates,
and
looked
up
to
see
Dany
on
the
wall
above
them.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Jhogo
called,
“I
have
been
to
the
great
city
Qarth,
and
returned
with
three
who
would
look
on
you
with
their
own
eyes.”

Dany
stared
down
at
the
strangers.
“Here
I
stand.
Look,
if
that
is
your
pleasure…
but
first
tell
me
your
names.”

The
pale
man
with
the
blue
lips
replied
in
guttural
Dothraki,
“I
am
Pyat
Pree,
the
great
warlock.”

The
bald
man
with
the
jewels
in
his
nose
answered
in
the
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
“I
am
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
of
the
Thirteen,
a
merchant
prince
of
Qarth.”

The
woman
in
the
lacquered
wooden
mask
said
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
“I
am
Quaithe
of
the
Shadow.
We
come
seeking
dragons.”

“Seek
no
more,”
Daenerys
Targaryen
told
them.
“You
have
found
them.”





JON

Whitetree,
the
village
was
named
on
Sam’s
old
maps.
Jon
did
not
think
it
much
of
a
village.
Four
tumbledown
one-room
houses
of
unmortared
stone
surrounded
an
empty
sheepfold
and
a
well.
The
houses
were
roofed
with
sod,
the
windows
shuttered
with
ragged
pieces
of
hide.
And
above
them
loomed
the
pale
limbs
and
dark
red
leaves
of
a
monstrous
great
weirwood.

It
was
the
biggest
tree
Jon
Snow
had
ever
seen,
the
trunk
near
eight
feet
wide,
the
branches
spreading
so
far
that
the
entire
village
was
shaded
beneath
their
canopy.
The
size
did
not
disturb
him
so
much
as
the
face…
the
mouth
especially,
no
simple
carved
slash,
but
a
jagged
hollow
large
enough
to
swallow
a
sheep.

Those
are
not
sheep
bones,
though.
Nor
is
that
a
sheep’s
skull
in
the
ashes.

“An
old
tree.”
Mormont
sat
his
horse,
frowning.
“Old,”
his
raven
agreed
from
his
shoulder.
“Old,
old,
old.”

“And
powerful.”
Jon
could
feel
the
power.

Thoren
Smallwood
dismounted
beside
the
trunk,
dark
in
his
plate
and
mail.
“Look
at
that
face.
Small
wonder
men
feared
them,
when
they
first
came
to
Westeros.
I’d
like
to
take
an
axe
to
the
bloody
thing
myself.”

Jon
said,
“My
lord
father
believed
no
man
could
tell
a
lie
in
front
of
a
heart
tree.
The
old
gods
know
when
men
are
lying.”

“My
father
believed
the
same,”
said
the
Old
Bear.
“Let
me
have
a
look
at
that
skull.”

Jon
dismounted.
Slung
across
his
back
in
a
black
leather
shoulder
sheath
was
Longclaw,
the
hand-and-a-half
bastard
blade
the
Old
Bear
had
given
him
for
saving
his
life.
A
bastard
sword
for
a
bastard,
the
men
joked.
The
hilt
had
been
fashioned
new
for
him,
adorned
with
a
wolf’s-head
pommel
in
pale
stone,
but
the
blade
itself
was
Valyrian
steel,
old
and
light
and
deadly
sharp.

He
knelt
and
reached
a
gloved
hand
down
into
the
maw.
The
inside
of
the
hollow
was
red
with
dried
sap
and
blackened
by
fire.
Beneath
the
skull
he
saw
another,
smaller,
the
jaw
broken
off.
It
was
half-buried
in
ash
and
bits
of
bone.

When
he
brought
the
skull
to
Mormont,
the
Old
Bear
lifted
it
in
both
hands
and
stared
into
the
empty
sockets.
“The
wildlings
burn
their
dead.
We’ve
always
known
that.
Now
I
wished
I’d
asked
them
why,
when
there
were
still
a
few
around
to
ask.”

Jon
Snow
remembered
the
wight
rising,
its
eyes
shining
blue
in
the
pale
dead
face.
He
knew
why,
he
was
certain.

“Would
that
bones
could
talk,”
the
Old
Bear
grumbled.
“This
fellow
could
tell
us
much.
How
he
died.
Who
burned
him,
and
why.
Where
the
wildlings
have
gone.”
He
sighed.
“The
children
of
the
forest
could
speak
to
the
dead,
it’s
said.
But
I
can’t.”
He
tossed
the
skull
back
into
the
mouth
of
the
tree,
where
it
landed
with
a
puff
of
fine
ash.
“Go
through
all
these
houses.
Giant,
get
to
the
top
of
this
tree,
have
a
look.
I’ll
have
the
hounds
brought
up
too.
Perchance
this
time
the
trail
will
be
fresher.”
His
tone
did
not
suggest
that
he
held
out
much
hope
of
the
last.

Two
men
went
through
each
house,
to
make
certain
nothing
was
missed.
Jon
was
paired
with
dour
Eddison
Tollett,
a
squire
grey
of
hair
and
thin
as
a
pike,
whom
the
other
brothers
called
Dolorous
Edd.
“Bad
enough
when
the
dead
come
walking,”
he
said
to
Jon
as
they
crossed
the
village,
“now
the
Old
Bear
wants
them
talking
as
well?
No
good
will
come
of
that,
I’ll
warrant.
And
who’s
to
say
the
bones
wouldn’t
lie?
Why
should
death
make
a
man
truthful,
or
even
clever?
The
dead
are
likely
dull
fellows,
full
of
tedious
complaints—the
ground’s
too
cold,
my
gravestone
should
be
larger,
why
does
he
get
more
worms
than
I
do…”

Jon
had
to
stoop
to
pass
through
the
low
door.
Within
he
found
a
packed
dirt
floor.
There
were
no
furnishings,
no
sign
that
people
had
lived
here
but
for
some
ashes
beneath
the
smoke
hole
in
the
roof.
“What
a
dismal
place
to
live,”
he
said.

“I
was
born
in
a
house
much
like
this,”
declared
Dolorous
Edd.
“Those
were
my
enchanted
years.
Later
I
fell
on
hard
times.”
A
nest
of
dry
straw
bedding
filled
one
corner
of
the
room.
Edd
looked
at
it
with
longing.
“I’d
give
all
the
gold
in
Casterly
Rock
to
sleep
in
a
bed
again.”

“You
call
that
a
bed?”

“If
it’s
softer
than
the
ground
and
has
a
roof
over
it,
I
call
it
a
bed.”
Dolorous
Edd
sniffed
the
air.
“I
smell
dung.”

The
smell
was
very
faint.
“Old
dung,”
said
Jon.
The
house
felt
as
though
it
had
been
empty
for
some
time.
Kneeling,
he
searched
through
the
straw
with
his
hands
to
see
if
anything
had
been
concealed
beneath,
then
made
a
round
of
the
walls.
It
did
not
take
very
long.
“There’s
nothing
here.”

Nothing
was
what
he
had
expected;
Whitetree
was
the
fourth
village
they
had
passed,
and
it
had
been
the
same
in
all
of
them.
The
people
were
gone,
vanished
with
their
scant
possessions
and
whatever
animals
they
may
have
had.
None
of
the
villages
showed
any
signs
of
having
been
attacked.
They
were
simply…
empty.
“What
do
you
think
happened
to
them
all?”
Jon
asked.

“Something
worse
than
we
can
imagine,”
suggested
Dolorous
Edd.
“Well,
I
might
be
able
to
imagine
it,
but
I’d
sooner
not.
Bad
enough
to
know
you’re
going
to
come
to
some
awful
end
without
thinking
about
it
aforetime.”

Two
of
the
hounds
were
sniffing
around
the
door
as
they
reemerged.
Other
dogs
ranged
through
the
village.
Chett
was
cursing
them
loudly,
his
voice
thick
with
the
anger
he
never
seemed
to
put
aside.
The
light
filtering
through
the
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
made
the
boils
on
his
face
look
even
more
inflamed
than
usual.
When
he
saw
Jon
his
eyes
narrowed;
there
was
no
love
lost
between
them.

The
other
houses
had
yielded
no
wisdom.
“Gone,”
cried
Mormont’s
raven,
flapping
up
into
the
weirwood
to
perch
above
them.
“Gone,
gone,
gone.”

“There
were
wildlings
at
Whitetree
only
a
year
ago.”
Thoren
Smallwood
looked
more
a
lord
than
Mormont
did,
clad
in
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker’s
gleaming
black
mail
and
embossed
breastplate.
His
heavy
cloak
was
richly
trimmed
with
sable,
and
clasped
with
the
crossed
hammers
of
the
Rykkers,
wrought
in
silver.
Ser
Jaremy’s
cloak,
once…
but
the
wight
had
claimed
Ser
Jaremy,
and
the
Night’s
Watch
wasted
nothing.

“A
year
ago
Robert
was
king,
and
the
realm
was
at
peace,”
declared
Jarman
Buckwell,
the
square
stolid
man
who
commanded
the
scouts.
“Much
can
change
in
a
year’s
time.”

“One
thing
hasn’t
changed,”
Ser
Mallador
Locke
insisted.
“Fewer
wildlings
means
fewer
worries.
I
won’t
mourn,
whatever’s
become
of
them.
Raiders
and
murderers,
the
lot
of
them.”

Jon
heard
a
rustling
from
the
red
leaves
above.
Two
branches
parted,
and
he
glimpsed
a
little
man
moving
from
limb
to
limb
as
easily
as
a
squirrel.
Bedwyck
stood
no
more
than
five
feet
tall,
but
the
grey
streaks
in
his
hair
showed
his
age.
The
other
rangers
called
him
Giant.
He
sat
in
a
fork
of
the
tree
over
their
heads
and
said,
“There’s
water
to
the
north.
A
lake,
might
be.
A
few
flint
hills
rising
to
the
west,
not
very
high.
Nothing
else
to
see,
my
lords.”

“We
might
camp
here
tonight,”
Smallwood
suggested.

The
Old
Bear
glanced
up,
searching
for
a
glimpse
of
sky
through
the
pale
limbs
and
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood.
“No,”
he
declared.
“Giant,
how
much
daylight
remains
to
us?”

“Three
hours,
my
lord.”

“We’ll
press
on
north,”
Mormont
decided.
“If
we
reach
this
lake,
we
can
make
camp
by
the
shore,
perchance
catch
a
few
fish.
Jon,
fetch
me
paper,
it’s
past
time
I
wrote
Maester
Aemon.”

Jon
found
parchment,
quill,
and
ink
in
his
saddlebag
and
brought
them
to
the
Lord
Commander.
At
Whitetree,
Mormont
scrawled.
The
fourth
village.
All
empty.
The
wildlings
are
gone.
“Find
Tarly
and
see
that
he
gets
this
on
its
way,”
he
said
as
he
handed
Jon
the
message.
When
he
whistled,
his
raven
came
flapping
down
to
land
on
his
horse’s
head.
“Corn,”
the
raven
suggested,
bobbing.
The
horse
whickered.

Jon
mounted
his
garron,
wheeled
him
about,
and
trotted
off.
Beyond
the
shade
of
the
great
weirwood
the
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch
stood
beneath
lesser
trees,
tending
their
horses,
chewing
strips
of
salt
beef,
pissing,
scratching,
and
talking.
When
the
command
was
given
to
move
out
again,
the
talk
died,
and
they
climbed
back
into
their
saddles.
Jarman
Buckwell’s
scouts
rode
out
first,
with
the
vanguard
under
Thoren
Smallwood
heading
the
column
proper.
Then
came
the
Old
Bear
with
the
main
force,
Ser
Mallador
Locke
with
the
baggage
train
and
packhorses,
and
finally
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
and
the
rear
guard.
Two
hundred
men
all
told,
with
half
again
as
many
mounts.

By
day
they
followed
game
trails
and
streambeds,
the
“ranger’s
roads”
that
led
them
ever
deeper
into
the
wilderness
of
leaf
and
root.
At
night
they
camped
beneath
a
starry
sky
and
gazed
up
at
the
comet.
The
black
brothers
had
left
Castle
Black
in
good
spirits,
joking
and
trading
tales,
but
of
late
the
brooding
silence
of
the
wood
seemed
to
have
sombered
them
all.
Jests
had
grown
fewer
and
tempers
shorter.
No
one
would
admit
to
being
afraid—they
were
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
after
all—but
Jon
could
feel
the
unease.
Four
empty
villages,
no
wildlings
anywhere,
even
the
game
seemingly
fled.
The
haunted
forest
had
never
seemed
more
haunted,
even
veteran
rangers
agreed.

As
he
rode,
Jon
peeled
off
his
glove
to
air
his
burned
fingers.
Ugly
things.
He
remembered
suddenly
how
he
used
to
muss
Arya’s
hair.
His
little
stick
of
a
sister.
He
wondered
how
she
was
faring.
It
made
him
a
little
sad
to
think
that
he
might
never
muss
her
hair
again.
He
began
to
flex
his
hand,
opening
and
closing
the
fingers.
If
he
let
his
sword
hand
stiffen
and
grow
clumsy,
it
well
might
be
the
end
of
him,
he
knew.
A
man
needed
his
sword
beyond
the
Wall.

Jon
found
Samwell
Tarly
with
the
other
stewards,
watering
his
horses.
He
had
three
to
tend:
his
own
mount,
and
two
packhorses,
each
bearing
a
large
wire-and-wicker
cage
full
of
ravens.
The
birds
flapped
their
wings
at
Jon’s
approach
and
screamed
at
him
through
the
bars.
A
few
shrieks
sounded
suspiciously
like
words.
“Have
you
been
teaching
them
to
talk?”
he
asked
Sam.

“A
few
words.
Three
of
them
can
say
snow.”

“One
bird
croaking
my
name
was
bad
enough,”
said
Jon,
“and
snow’s
nothing
a
black
brother
wants
to
hear
about.”
Snow
often
meant
death
in
the
north.

“Was
there
anything
in
Whitetree?”

“Bones,
ashes,
and
empty
houses.”
Jon
handed
Sam
the
roll
of
parchment.
“The
Old
Bear
wants
word
sent
back
to
Aemon.”

Sam
took
a
bird
from
one
of
the
cages,
stroked
its
feathers,
attached
the
message,
and
said,
“Fly
home
now,
brave
one.
Home.”
The
raven
quorked
something
unintelligible
back
at
him,
and
Sam
tossed
it
into
the
air.
Flapping,
it
beat
its
way
skyward
through
the
trees.
“I
wish
he
could
carry
me
with
him.”

“Still?”

“Well,”
said
Sam,
“yes,
but…
I’m
not
as
frightened
as
I
was,
truly.
The
first
night,
every
time
I
heard
someone
getting
up
to
make
water,
I
thought
it
was
wildlings
creeping
in
to
slit
my
throat.
I
was
afraid
that
if
I
closed
my
eyes,
I
might
never
open
them
again,
only…
well…
dawn
came
after
all.”
He
managed
a
wan
smile.
“I
may
be
craven,
but
I’m
not
stupid.
I’m
sore
and
my
back
aches
from
riding
and
from
sleeping
on
the
ground,
but
I’m
hardly
scared
at
all.
Look.”
He
held
out
a
hand
for
Jon
to
see
how
steady
it
was.
“I’ve
been
working
on
my
maps.”

The
world
is
strange,
Jon
thought.
Two
hundred
brave
men
had
left
the
Wall,
and
the
only
one
who
was
not
growing
more
fearful
was
Sam,
the
self-confessed
coward.
“We’ll
make
a
ranger
of
you
yet,”
he
joked.
“Next
thing,
you’ll
want
to
be
an
outrider
like
Grenn.
Shall
I
speak
to
the
Old
Bear?”

“Don’t
you
dare!”
Sam
pulled
up
the
hood
of
his
enormous
black
cloak
and
clambered
awkwardly
back
onto
his
horse.
It
was
a
plow
horse,
big
and
slow
and
clumsy,
but
better
able
to
bear
his
weight
than
the
little
garrons
the
rangers
rode.
“I
had
hoped
we
might
stay
the
night
in
the
village,”
he
said
wistfully.
“It
would
be
nice
to
sleep
under
a
roof
again.”

“Too
few
roofs
for
all
of
us.”
Jon
mounted
again,
gave
Sam
a
parting
smile,
and
rode
off.
The
column
was
well
under
way,
so
he
swung
wide
around
the
village
to
avoid
the
worst
of
the
congestion.
He
had
seen
enough
of
Whitetree.

Ghost
emerged
from
the
undergrowth
so
suddenly
that
the
garron
shied
and
reared.
The
white
wolf
hunted
well
away
from
the
line
of
march,
but
he
was
not
having
much
better
fortune
than
the
foragers
Smallwood
sent
out
after
game.
The
woods
were
as
empty
as
the
villages,
Dywen
had
told
him
one
night
around
the
fire.
“We’re
a
large
party,”
Jon
had
said.
“The
game’s
probably
been
frightened
away
by
all
the
noise
we
make
on
the
march.”

“Frightened
away
by
something,
no
doubt,”
Dywen
said.

Once
the
horse
had
settled,
Ghost
loped
along
easily
beside
him.
Jon
caught
up
to
Mormont
as
he
was
wending
his
way
around
a
hawthorn
thicket.
“Is
the
bird
away?”
the
Old
Bear
asked.

“Yes,
my
lord.
Sam
is
teaching
them
to
talk.”

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
“He’ll
regret
that.
Damned
things
make
a
lot
of
noise,
but
they
never
say
a
thing
worth
hearing.”

They
rode
in
silence,
until
Jon
said,
“If
my
uncle
found
all
these
villages
empty
as
well—”

“—he
would
have
made
it
his
purpose
to
learn
why,”
Lord
Mormont
finished
for
him,
“and
it
may
well
be
someone
or
something
did
not
want
that
known.
Well,
we’ll
be
three
hundred
when
Qhorin
joins
us.
Whatever
enemy
waits
out
here
will
not
find
us
so
easy
to
deal
with.
We
will
find
them,
Jon,
I
promise
you.”

Or
they
will
find
us,
thought
Jon.





ARYA

The
river
was
a
blue-green
ribbon
shining
in
the
morning
sun.
Reeds
grew
thick
in
the
shallows
along
the
banks,
and
Arya
saw
a
water
snake
skimming
across
the
surface,
ripples
spreading
out
behind
it
as
it
went.
Overhead
a
hawk
flew
in
lazy
circles.

It
seemed
a
peaceful
place…
until
Koss
spotted
the
dead
man.
“There,
in
the
reeds.”
He
pointed,
and
Arya
saw
it.
The
body
of
a
soldier,
shapeless
and
swollen.
His
sodden
green
cloak
had
hung
up
on
a
rotted
log,
and
a
school
of
tiny
silver
fishes
were
nibbling
at
his
face.
“I
told
you
there
was
bodies,”
Lommy
announced.
“I
could
taste
them
in
that
water.”

When
Yoren
saw
the
corpse,
he
spat.
“Dobber,
see
if
he’s
got
anything
worth
the
taking.
Mail,
knife,
a
bit
o’
coin,
what
have
you.”
He
spurred
his
gelding
and
rode
out
into
the
river,
but
the
horse
struggled
in
the
soft
mud
and
beyond
the
reeds
the
water
deepened.
Yoren
rode
back
angry,
his
horse
covered
in
brown
slime
up
to
the
knees.
“We
won’t
be
crossing
here.
Koss,
you’ll
come
with
me
upriver,
look
for
a
ford.
Woth,
Gerren,
you
go
downstream.
The
rest
o’
you
wait
here.
Put
a
guard
out.”

Dobber
found
a
leather
purse
in
the
dead
man’s
belt.
Inside
were
four
coppers
and
a
little
hank
of
blond
hair
tied
up
with
a
red
ribbon.
Lommy
and
Tarber
stripped
naked
and
went
wading,
and
Lommy
scooped
up
handfuls
of
slimy
mud
and
threw
them
at
Hot
Pie,
shouting,
“Mud
Pie!
Mud
Pie!”
In
the
back
of
their
wagon,
Rorge
cursed
and
threatened
and
told
them
to
unchain
him
while
Yoren
was
gone,
but
no
one
paid
him
any
mind.
Kurz
caught
a
fish
with
his
bare
hands.
Arya
saw
how
he
did
it,
standing
over
a
shallow
pool,
calm
as
still
water,
his
hand
darting
out
quick
as
a
snake
when
the
fish
swam
near.
It
didn’t
look
as
hard
as
catching
cats.
Fish
didn’t
have
claws.

It
was
midday
when
the
others
returned.
Woth
reported
a
wooden
bridge
half
a
mile
downstream,
but
someone
had
burned
it
up.
Yoren
peeled
a
sourleaf
off
the
bale.
“Might
be
we
could
swim
the
horses
over,
maybe
the
donkeys,
but
there’s
no
way
we’ll
get
those
wagons
across.
And
there’s
smoke
to
the
north
and
west,
more
fires,
could
be
this
side
o’
the
river’s
the
place
we
want
to
be.”
He
picked
up
a
long
stick
and
drew
a
circle
in
the
mud,
a
line
trailing
down
from
it.
“That’s
Gods
Eye,
with
the
river
flowing
south.
We’re
here.”
He
poked
a
hole
beside
the
line
of
the
river,
under
the
circle.
“We
can’t
go
round
west
of
the
lake,
like
I
thought.
East
takes
us
back
to
the
kingsroad.”
He
moved
the
stick
up
to
where
the
line
and
circle
met.
“Near
as
I
recall,
there’s
a
town
here.
The
holdfast’s
stone,
and
there’s
a
lordling
got
his
seat
there
too,
just
a
towerhouse,
but
he’ll
have
a
guard,
might
be
a
knight
or
two.
We
follow
the
river
north,
should
be
there
before
dark.
They’ll
have
boats,
so
I
mean
to
sell
all
we
got
and
hire
us
one.”
He
drew
the
stick
up
through
the
circle
of
the
lake,
from
bottom
to
top.
“Gods
be
good,
we’ll
find
a
wind
and
sail
across
the
Gods
Eye
to
Harrentown.”
He
thrust
the
point
down
at
the
top
of
the
circle.
“We
can
buy
new
mounts
there,
or
else
take
shelter
at
Harrenhal.
That’s
Lady
Whent’s
seat,
and
she’s
always
been
a
friend
o’
the
Watch.”

Hot
Pie’s
eyes
got
wide.
“There’s
ghosts
in
Harrenhal…”

Yoren
spat.
“There’s
for
your
ghosts.”
He
tossed
the
stick
down
in
the
mud.
“Mount
up.”

Arya
was
remembering
the
stories
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
of
Harrenhal.
Evil
King
Harren
had
walled
himself
up
inside,
so
Aegon
unleashed
his
dragons
and
turned
the
castle
into
a
pyre.
Nan
said
that
fiery
spirits
still
haunted
the
blackened
towers.
Sometimes
men
went
to
sleep
safe
in
their
beds
and
were
found
dead
in
the
morning,
all
burnt
up.
Arya
didn’t
really
believe
that,
and
anyhow
it
had
all
happened
a
long
time
ago.
Hot
Pie
was
being
silly;
it
wouldn’t
be
ghosts
at
Harrenhal,
it
would
be
knights.
Arya
could
reveal
herself
to
Lady
Whent,
and
the
knights
would
escort
her
home
and
keep
her
safe.
That
was
what
knights
did;
they
kept
you
safe,
especially
women.
Maybe
Lady
Whent
would
even
help
the
crying
girl.

The
river
track
was
no
kingsroad,
yet
it
was
not
half
bad
for
what
it
was,
and
for
once
the
wagons
rolled
along
smartly.
They
saw
the
first
house
an
hour
shy
of
evenfall,
a
snug
little
thatch-roofed
cottage
surrounded
by
fields
of
wheat.
Yoren
rode
out
ahead,
hallooing,
but
got
no
answer.
“Dead,
might
be.
Or
hiding.
Dobber,
Rey,
with
me.”
The
three
men
went
into
the
cottage.
“Pots
is
gone,
no
sign
o’
any
coin
laid
by,”
Yoren
muttered
when
they
returned.
“No
animals.
Run,
most
like.
Might
be
we
met
‘em
on
the
kingsroad.”
At
least
the
house
and
field
had
not
been
burned,
and
there
were
no
corpses
about.
Tarber
found
a
garden
out
back,
and
they
pulled
some
onions
and
radishes
and
filled
a
sack
with
cabbages
before
they
went
on
their
way.

A
little
farther
up
the
road,
they
glimpsed
a
forester’s
cabin
surrounded
by
old
trees
and
neatly
stacked
logs
ready
for
the
splitting,
and
later
a
ramshackle
stilt-house
leaning
over
the
river
on
poles
ten
feet
tall,
both
deserted.
They
passed
more
fields,
wheat
and
corn
and
barley
ripening
in
the
sun,
but
here
there
were
no
men
sitting
in
trees,
nor
walking
the
rows
with
scythes.
Finally
the
town
came
into
view;
a
cluster
of
white
houses
spread
out
around
the
walls
of
the
holdfast,
a
big
sept
with
a
shingled
wooden
roof,
the
lord’s
towerhouse
sitting
on
a
small
rise
to
the
west…
and
no
sign
of
any
people,
anywhere.

Yoren
sat
on
his
horse,
frowning
through
his
tangle
of
beard.
“Don’t
like
it,”
he
said,
“but
there
it
is.
We’ll
go
have
us
a
look.
A
careful
look.
See
maybe
there’s
some
folk
hiding.
Might
be
they
left
a
boat
behind,
or
some
weapons
we
can
use.”

The
black
brother
left
ten
to
guard
the
wagons
and
the
whimpery
little
girl,
and
split
the
rest
of
them
into
four
groups
of
five
to
search
the
town.
“Keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open,”
he
warned
them,
before
he
rode
off
to
the
towerhouse
to
see
if
there
was
any
sign
of
the
lordling
or
his
guards.

Arya
found
herself
with
Gendry,
Hot
Pie,
and
Lommy.
Squat,
kettle-bellied
Woth
had
pulled
an
oar
on
a
galley
once,
which
made
him
the
next
best
thing
they
had
to
a
sailor,
so
Yoren
told
him
to
take
them
down
to
the
lakefront
and
see
if
they
could
find
a
boat.
As
they
rode
between
the
silent
white
houses,
gooseprickles
crawled
up
Arya’s
arms.
This
empty
town
frightened
her
almost
as
much
as
the
burnt
holdfast
where
they’d
found
the
crying
girl
and
the
one-armed
woman.
Why
would
people
run
off
and
leave
their
homes
and
everything?
What
could
scare
them
so
much?

The
sun
was
low
to
the
west,
and
the
houses
cast
long
dark
shadows.
A
sudden
clap
of
sound
made
Arya
reach
for
Needle,
but
it
was
only
a
shutter
banging
in
the
wind.
After
the
open
river
shore,
the
closeness
of
the
town
unnerved
her.

When
she
glimpsed
the
lake
ahead
between
houses
and
trees,
Arya
put
her
knees
into
her
horse,
galloping
past
Woth
and
Gendry.
She
burst
out
onto
the
grassy
sward
beside
the
pebbled
shore.
The
setting
sun
made
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
water
shimmer
like
a
sheet
of
beaten
copper.
It
was
the
biggest
lake
she
had
ever
seen,
with
no
hint
of
a
far
shore.
She
saw
a
rambling
inn
to
her
left,
built
out
over
the
water
on
heavy
wooden
pilings.
To
her
right,
a
long
pier
jutted
into
the
lake,
and
there
were
other
docks
farther
east,
wooden
fingers
reaching
out
from
the
town.
But
the
only
boat
in
view
was
an
upside-down
rowboat
abandoned
on
the
rocks
beneath
the
inn,
its
bottom
thoroughly
rotted
out.
“They’re
gone,”
Arya
said,
dejected.
What
would
they
do
now?

“There’s
an
inn,”
Lommy
said,
when
the
others
rode
up.
“Do
you
think
they
left
any
food?
Or
ale?”

“Let’s
go
see,”
Hot
Pie
suggested.

“Never
you
mind
about
no
inn,”
snapped
Woth.
“Yoren
said
we’re
to
find
a
boat.”

“They
took
the
boats.”
Somehow
Arya
knew
it
was
true;
they
could
search
the
whole
town,
and
they’d
find
no
more
than
the
upside-down
rowboat.
Despondent,
she
climbed
off
her
horse
and
knelt
by
the
lake.
The
water
lapped
softly
around
her
legs.
A
few
lantern
bugs
were
coming
out,
their
little
lights
blinking
on
and
off.
The
green
water
was
warm
as
tears,
but
there
was
no
salt
in
it.
It
tasted
of
summer
and
mud
and
growing
things.
Arya
plunged
her
face
down
into
it
to
wash
off
the
dust
and
dirt
and
sweat
of
the
day.
When
she
leaned
back
the
trickles
ran
down
the
back
of
her
neck
and
under
her
collar.
They
felt
good.
She
wished
she
could
take
off
her
clothes
and
swim,
gliding
through
the
warm
water
like
an
skinny
pink
otter.
Maybe
she
could
swim
all
the
way
to
Winterfell.

Woth
was
shouting
at
her
to
help
search,
so
she
did,
peering
into
boathouses
and
sheds
while
her
horse
grazed
along
the
shore.
They
found
some
sails,
some
nails,
buckets
of
tar
gone
hard,
and
a
mother
cat
with
a
litter
of
new-born
kittens.
But
no
boats.

The
town
was
as
dark
as
any
forest
when
Yoren
and
the
others
reappeared.
“Tower’s
empty,”
he
said.
“Lord’s
gone
off
to
fight
maybe,
or
to
get
his
smallfolk
to
safety,
no
telling.
Not
a
horse
or
pig
left
in
town,
but
we’ll
eat.
Saw
a
goose
running
loose,
and
some
chickens,
and
there’s
good
fish
in
the
Gods
Eye.”

“The
boats
are
gone,”
Arya
reported.

“We
could
patch
the
bottom
of
that
rowboat,”
said
Koss.

“Might
do
for
four
o’
us,”
Yoren
said.

“There’s
nails,”
Lommy
pointed
out.
“And
there’s
trees
all
around.
We
could
build
us
all
boats.”

Yoren
spat.
“You
know
anything
’bout
boat-building,
dyer’s
boy?”
Lommy
looked
blank.

“A
raft,”
suggested
Gendry.
“Anyone
can
build
a
raft,
and
long
poles
for
pushing.”

Yoren
looked
thoughtful.
“Lake’s
too
deep
to
pole
across,
but
if
we
stayed
to
the
shallows
near
shore…
it’d
mean
leaving
the
wagons.
Might
be
that’s
best.
I’ll
sleep
on
it.”

“Can
we
stay
at
the
inn?”
Lommy
asked.

“We’ll
stay
in
the
holdfast,
with
the
gates
barred,”
the
old
man
said.
“I
like
the
feel
o’
stone
walls
about
me
when
I
sleep.”

Arya
could
not
keep
quiet.
“We
shouldn’t
stay
here,”
she
blurted.
“The
people
didn’t.
They
all
ran
off,
even
their
lord.”

“Arry’s
scared,”
Lommy
announced,
braying
laughter.

“I’m
not,”
she
snapped
back,
“but
they
were.”

“Smart
boy,”
said
Yoren.
“Thing
is,
the
folks
who
lived
here
were
at
war,
like
it
or
no.
We’re
not.
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
part,
so
no
man’s
our
enemy.”

And
no
man’s
our
friend,
she
thought,
but
this
time
she
held
her
tongue.
Lommy
and
the
rest
were
looking
at
her,
and
she
did
not
want
to
seem
craven
in
front
of
them.

The
holdfast
gates
were
studded
with
iron
nails.
Within,
they
found
a
pair
of
iron
bars
the
size
of
saplings,
with
post
holes
in
the
ground
and
metal
brackets
on
the
gate.
When
they
slotted
the
bars
through
the
brackets,
they
made
a
huge
X
brace.
It
was
no
Red
Keep,
Yoren
announced
when
they’d
explored
the
holdfast
top
to
bottom,
but
it
was
better
than
most,
and
should
do
for
a
night
well
enough.
The
walls
were
rough
unmortared
stone
ten
feet
high,
with
a
wooden
catwalk
inside
the
battlements.
There
was
a
postern
gate
to
the
north,
and
Gerren
discovered
a
trap
under
the
straw
in
the
old
wooden
barn,
leading
to
a
narrow,
winding
tunnel.
He
followed
it
a
long
way
under
the
earth
and
came
out
by
the
lake.
Yoren
had
them
roll
a
wagon
on
top
of
the
trap,
to
make
certain
no
one
came
in
that
way.
He
divided
them
into
three
watches,
and
sent
Tarber,
Kurz,
and
Cutjack
off
to
the
abandoned
towerhouse
to
keep
an
eye
out
from
on
high.
Kurz
had
a
hunting
horn
to
sound
if
danger
threatened.

They
drove
their
wagons
and
animals
inside
and
barred
the
gates
behind
them.
The
barn
was
a
ramshackle
thing,
large
enough
to
hold
half
the
animals
in
the
town.
The
haven,
where
the
townfolk
would
shelter
in
times
of
trouble,
was
even
larger,
low
and
long
and
built
of
stone,
with
a
thatched
roof.
Koss
went
out
the
postern
gate
and
brought
the
goose
back,
and
two
chickens
as
well,
and
Yoren
allowed
a
cookfire.
There
was
a
big
kitchen
inside
the
holdfast,
though
all
the
pots
and
kettles
had
been
taken.
Gendry,
Dobber,
and
Arya
drew
cook
duty.
Dobber
told
Arya
to
pluck
the
fowl
while
Gendry
split
wood.
“Why
can’t
I
split
the
wood?”
she
asked,
but
no
one
listened.
Sullenly,
she
set
to
plucking
a
chicken
while
Yoren
sat
on
the
end
of
the
bench
sharpening
the
edge
of
his
dirk
with
a
whetstone.

When
the
food
was
ready,
Arya
ate
a
chicken
leg
and
a
bit
of
onion.
No
one
talked
much,
not
even
Lommy.
Gendry
went
off
by
himself
afterward,
polishing
his
helm
with
a
look
on
his
face
like
he
wasn’t
even
there.
The
crying
girl
whimpered
and
wept,
but
when
Hot
Pie
offered
her
a
bit
of
goose
she
gobbled
it
down
and
looked
for
more.

Arya
drew
second
watch,
so
she
found
a
straw
pallet
in
the
haven.
Sleep
did
not
come
easy,
so
she
borrowed
Yoren’s
stone
and
set
to
honing
Needle.
Syrio
Forel
had
said
that
a
dull
blade
was
like
a
lame
horse.
Hot
Pie
squatted
on
the
pallet
beside
her,
watching
her
work.
“Where’d
you
get
a
good
sword
like
that?”
he
asked.
When
he
saw
the
look
she
gave
him,
he
raised
his
hands
defensively.
“I
never
said
you
stole
it,
I
just
wanted
to
know
where
you
got
it,
is
all.”

“My
brother
gave
it
to
me,”
she
muttered.

“I
never
knew
you
had
no
brother.”

Arya
paused
to
scratch
under
her
shirt.
There
were
fleas
in
the
straw,
though
she
couldn’t
see
why
a
few
more
would
bother
her.
“I
have
lots
of
brothers.”

“You
do?
Are
they
bigger
than
you,
or
littler?”

I
shouldn’t
be
talking
like
this.
Yoren
said
I
should
keep
my
mouth
shut.
“Bigger,”
she
lied.
“They
have
swords
too,
big
longswords,
and
they
showed
me
how
to
kill
people
who
bother
me.”

“I
was
talking,
not
bothering.”
Hot
Pie
went
off
and
let
her
alone
and
Arya
curled
up
on
her
pallet.
She
could
hear
the
crying
girl
from
the
far
side
of
the
haven.
I
wish
she’d
just
be
quiet.
Why
does
she
have
to
cry
all
the
time?

She
must
have
slept,
though
she
never
remembered
closing
her
eyes.
She
dreamed
a
wolf
was
howling,
and
the
sound
was
so
terrible
that
it
woke
her
at
once.
Arya
sat
up
on
her
pallet
with
her
heart
thumping.
“Hot
Pie,
wake
up.”
She
scrambled
to
her
feet.
“Woth,
Gendry,
didn’t
you
hear?”
She
pulled
on
a
boot.

All
around
her,
men
and
boys
stirred
and
crawled
from
their
pallets.
“What’s
wrong?”
Hot
Pie
asked.
“Hear
what?”
Gendry
wanted
to
know.
“Arry
had
a
bad
dream,”
someone
else
said.

“No,
I
heard
it,”
she
insisted.
“A
wolf.”

“Arry
has
wolves
in
his
head,”
sneered
Lommy.
“Let
them
howl,”
Gerren
said,
“they’re
out
there,
we’re
in
here.”
Woth
agreed.
“Never
saw
no
wolf
could
storm
a
holdfast.”
Hot
Pie
was
saying,
“I
never
heard
nothing.”

“It
was
a
wolf,”
she
shouted
at
them
as
she
yanked
on
her
second
boot.
“Something’s
wrong,
someone’s
coming,
get
up!”

Before
they
could
hoot
her
down
again,
the
sound
came
shuddering
through
the
night—only
it
was
no
wolf
this
time,
it
was
Kurz
blowing
his
hunting
horn,
sounding
danger.
In
a
heartbeat,
all
of
them
were
pulling
on
clothes
and
snatching
for
whatever
weapons
they
owned.
Arya
ran
for
the
gate
as
the
horn
sounded
again.
As
she
dashed
past
the
barn,
Biter
threw
himself
furiously
against
his
chains,
and
Jaqen
H’ghar
called
out
from
the
back
of
their
wagon.
“Boy!
Sweet
boy!
Is
it
war,
red
war?
Boy,
free
us.
A
man
can
fight.
Boy!”
She
ignored
him
and
plunged
on.
By
then
she
could
hear
horses
and
shouts
beyond
the
wall.

She
scrambled
up
onto
the
catwalk.
The
parapets
were
a
bit
too
high
and
Arya
a
bit
too
short;
she
had
to
wedge
her
toes
into
the
holes
between
the
stones
to
see
over.
For
a
moment
she
thought
the
town
was
full
of
lantern
bugs.
Then
she
realized
they
were
men
with
torches,
galloping
between
the
houses.
She
saw
a
roof
go
up,
flames
licking
at
the
belly
of
the
night
with
hot
orange
tongues
as
the
thatch
caught.
Another
followed,
and
then
another,
and
soon
there
were
fires
blazing
everywhere.

Gendry
climbed
up
beside
her,
wearing
his
helm.
“How
many?”

Arya
tried
to
count,
but
they
were
riding
too
fast,
torches
spinning
through
the
air
as
they
flung
them.
“A
hundred,”
she
said.
“Two
hundred,
I
don’t
know.”
Over
the
roar
of
the
flames,
she
could
hear
shouts.
“They’ll
come
for
us
soon.”

“There,”
Gendry
said,
pointing.

A
column
of
riders
moved
between
the
burning
buildings
toward
the
holdfast.
Firelight
glittered
off
metal
helms
and
spattered
their
mail
and
plate
with
orange
and
yellow
highlights.
One
carried
a
banner
on
a
tall
lance.
She
thought
it
was
red,
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
the
night,
with
the
fires
roaring
all
around.
Everything
seemed
red
or
black
or
orange.

The
fire
leapt
from
one
house
to
another.
Arya
saw
a
tree
consumed,
the
flames
creeping
across
its
branches
until
it
stood
against
the
night
in
robes
of
living
orange.
Everyone
was
awake
now,
manning
the
catwalks
or
struggling
with
the
frightened
animals
below.
She
could
hear
Yoren
shouting
commands.
Something
bumped
against
her
leg,
and
she
glanced
down
to
discover
the
crying
girl
clutching
her.
“Get
away!”
She
wrenched
her
leg
free.
“What
are
you
doing
up
here?
Run
and
hide
someplace,
you
stupid.”
She
shoved
the
girl
away.

The
riders
reined
up
before
the
gates.
“You
in
the
holdfast!”
shouted
a
knight
in
a
tall
helm
with
a
spiked
crest.
“Open,
in
the
name
of
the
king!”

“Aye,
and
which
king
is
that?”
old
Reysen
yelled
back
down,
before
Woth
cuffed
him
into
silence.

Yoren
climbed
the
battlement
beside
the
gate,
his
faded
black
cloak
tied
to
a
wooden
staff.
“You
men
hold
down
here!”
he
shouted.
“The
townfolk’s
gone.”

“And
who
are
you,
old
man?
One
of
Lord
Beric’s
cravens?”
called
the
knight
in
the
spiked
helm.
“If
that
fat
fool
Thoros
is
in
there,
ask
him
how
he
likes
these
fires.”

“Got
no
such
man
here,”
Yoren
shouted
back.
“Only
some
lads
for
the
Watch.
Got
no
part
o’
your
war.”
He
hoisted
up
the
staff,
so
they
could
all
see
the
color
of
his
cloak.
“Have
a
look.
That’s
black,
for
the
Night’s
Watch.”

“Or
black
for
House
Dondarrion,”
called
the
man
who
bore
the
enemy
banner.
Arya
could
see
its
colors
more
clearly
now
in
the
light
of
the
burning
town:
a
golden
lion
on
red.
“Lord
Beric’s
sigil
is
a
purple
lightning
bolt
on
a
black
field.”

Suddenly
Arya
remembered
the
morning
she
had
thrown
the
orange
in
Sansa’s
face
and
gotten
juice
all
over
her
stupid
ivory
silk
gown.
There
had
been
some
southron
lordling
at
the
tourney,
her
sister’s
stupid
friend
Jeyne
was
in
love
with
him.
He
had
a
lightning
bolt
on
his
shield
and
her
father
had
sent
him
out
to
behead
the
Hound’s
brother.
It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
now,
something
that
had
happened
to
a
different
person
in
a
different
life…
to
Arya
Stark
the
Hand’s
daughter,
not
Arry
the
orphan
boy.
How
would
Arry
know
lords
and
such?

“Are
you
blind,
man?”
Yoren
waved
his
staff
back
and
forth,
making
the
cloak
ripple.
“You
see
a
bloody
lightning
bolt?”

“By
night
all
banners
look
black,”
the
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
observed.
“Open,
or
we’ll
know
you
for
outlaws
in
league
with
the
king’s
enemies.”

Yoren
spat.
“Who’s
got
your
command?”

“I
do.”
The
reflections
of
burning
houses
glimmered
dully
on
the
armor
of
his
warhorse
as
the
others
parted
to
let
him
pass.
He
was
a
stout
man
with
a
manticore
on
his
shield,
and
ornate
scrollwork
crawling
across
his
steel
breastplate.
Through
the
open
visor
of
his
helm,
a
face
pale
and
piggy
peered
up.
“Ser
Amory
Lorch,
bannerman
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
the
Hand
of
the
King.
The
true
king,
Joffrey.”
He
had
a
high,
thin
voice.
“In
his
name,
I
command
you
to
open
these
gates.”

All
around
them,
the
town
burned.
The
night
air
was
full
of
smoke,
and
the
drifting
red
embers
outnumbered
the
stars.
Yoren
scowled.
“Don’t
see
the
need.
Do
what
you
want
to
the
town,
it’s
naught
to
me,
but
leave
us
be.
We’re
no
foes
to
you.”

Look
with
your
eyes,
Arya
wanted
to
shout
at
the
men
below.
“Can’t
they
see
we’re
no
lords
or
knights?”
she
whispered.

“I
don’t
think
they
care,
Arry,”
Gendry
whispered
back.

And
she
looked
at
Ser
Amory’s
face,
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her
to
look,
and
she
saw
that
he
was
right.

“If
you
are
no
traitors,
open
your
gates,”
Ser
Amory
called.
“We’ll
make
certain
you’re
telling
it
true
and
be
on
our
way.”

Yoren
was
chewing
sourleaf.
“Told
you,
no
one
here
but
us.
You
got
my
word
on
that.”

The
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
laughed.
“The
crow
gives
us
his
word.”

“You
lost,
old
man?”
mocked
one
of
the
spearmen.
“The
Wall’s
a
long
way
north
o’
here.”

“I
command
you
once
more,
in
King
Joffrey’s
name,
to
prove
the
loyalty
you
profess
and
open
these
gates,”
said
Ser
Amory.

For
a
long
moment
Yoren
considered,
chewing.
Then
he
spat.
“Don’t
think
I
will.”

“So
be
it.
You
defy
the
king’s
command,
and
so
proclaim
yourselves
rebels,
black
cloaks
or
no.”

“Got
me
young
boys
in
here,”
Yoren
shouted
down.

“Young
boys
and
old
men
die
the
same.”
Ser
Amory
raised
a
lanquid
fist,
and
a
spear
came
hurtling
from
the
fire-bright
shadows
behind.
Yoren
must
have
been
the
target,
but
it
was
Woth
beside
him
who
was
hit.
The
spearhead
went
in
his
throat
and
exploded
out
the
back
of
his
neck,
dark
and
wet.
Woth
grabbed
at
the
shaft,
and
fell
boneless
from
the
walk.

“Storm
the
walls
and
kill
them
all,”
Ser
Amory
said
in
a
bored
voice.
More
spears
flew.
Arya
yanked
down
Hot
Pie
by
the
back
of
his
tunic.
From
outside
came
the
rattle
of
armor,
the
scrape
of
swords
on
scabbards,
the
banging
of
spears
on
shields,
mingled
with
curses
and
the
hoofbeats
of
racing
horses.
A
torch
sailed
spinning
above
their
heads,
trailing
fingers
of
fire
as
it
thumped
down
in
the
dirt
of
the
yard.

“Blades!”
Yoren
shouted.
“Spread
apart,
defend
the
wall
wherever
they
hit.
Koss,
Urreg,
hold
the
postern.
Lommy,
pull
that
spear
out
of
Woth
and
get
up
where
he
was.”

Hot
Pie
dropped
his
shortsword
when
he
tried
to
unsheath
it.
Arya
shoved
the
blade
back
into
his
hand.
“I
don’t
know
how
to
swordfight,”
he
said,
white-eyed.

“It’s
easy,”
Arya
said,
but
the
lie
died
in
her
throat
as
a
hand
grasped
the
top
of
the
parapet.
She
saw
it
by
the
light
of
the
burning
town,
so
clear
that
it
was
as
if
time
had
stopped.
The
fingers
were
blunt,
callused,
wiry
black
hairs
grew
between
the
knuckles,
there
was
dirt
under
the
nail
of
the
thumb.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
remembered
as
the
top
of
a
pothelm
loomed
up
behind
the
hand.

She
slashed
down
hard,
and
Needle’s
castle-forged
steel
bit
into
the
grasping
fingers
between
the
knuckles.
“Winterfell!”
she
screamed.
Blood
spurted,
fingers
flew,
and
the
helmed
face
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared.
“Behind!”
Hot
Pie
yelled.
Arya
whirled.
The
second
man
was
bearded
and
helmetless,
his
dirk
between
his
teeth
to
leave
both
hands
free
for
climbing.
As
he
swung
his
leg
over
the
parapet,
she
drove
her
point
at
his
eyes.
Needle
never
touched
him;
he
reeled
backward
and
fell.
I
hope
he
falls
on
his
face
and
cuts
off
his
tongue.
“Watch
them,
not
me!”
she
screamed
at
Hot
Pie.
The
next
time
someone
tried
to
climb
their
part
of
the
wall,
the
boy
hacked
at
his
hands
with
his
swordshort
until
the
man
dropped
away.

Ser
Amory
had
no
ladders,
but
the
holdfast
walls
were
rough-cut
and
unmortared,
easy
to
climb,
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
foes.
For
each
one
Arya
cut
or
stabbed
or
shoved
back,
another
was
coming
over
the
wall.
The
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
reached
the
rampart,
but
Yoren
tangled
his
black
banner
around
his
spike,
and
forced
the
point
of
his
dirk
through
his
armor
while
the
man
was
fighting
the
cloth.
Every
time
Arya
looked
up,
more
torches
were
flying,
trailing
long
tongues
of
flame
that
lingered
behind
her
eyes.
She
saw
a
gold
lion
on
a
red
banner
and
thought
of
Joffrey,
wishing
he
was
here
so
she
could
drive
Needle
through
his
sneery
face.
When
four
men
assaulted
the
gate
with
axes,
Koss
shot
them
down
with
arrows,
one
by
one.
Dobber
wrestled
a
man
off
the
walk,
and
Lommy
smashed
his
head
with
a
rock
before
he
could
rise,
and
hooted
until
he
saw
the
knife
in
Dobber’s
belly
and
realized
he
wouldn’t
be
getting
up
either.
Arya
jumped
over
a
dead
boy
no
older
than
Jon,
lying
with
his
arm
cut
off.
She
didn’t
think
she’d
done
it,
but
she
wasn’t
sure.
She
heard
Qyle
beg
for
mercy
before
a
knight
with
a
wasp
on
his
shield
smashed
his
face
in
with
a
spiked
mace.
Everything
smelled
of
blood
and
smoke
and
iron
and
piss,
but
after
a
time
it
seemed
like
that
was
only
one
smell.
She
never
saw
how
the
skinny
man
got
over
the
wall,
but
when
he
did
she
fell
on
him
with
Gendry
and
Hot
Pie.
Gendry’s
sword
shattered
on
the
man’s
helm,
tearing
it
off
his
head.
Underneath
he
was
bald
and
scared-looking,
with
missing
teeth
and
a
speckly
grey
beard,
but
even
as
she
was
feeling
sorry
for
him
she
was
killing
him,
shouting,
“Winterfell!
Winterfell!”
while
Hot
Pie
screamed
“Hot
Pie!”
beside
her
as
he
hacked
at
the
man’s
scrawny
neck.

When
the
skinny
man
was
dead,
Gendry
stole
his
sword
and
leapt
down
into
the
yard
to
fight
some
more.
Arya
looked
past
him,
and
saw
steel
shadows
running
through
the
holdfast,
firelight
shining
off
mail
and
blades,
and
she
knew
that
they’d
gotten
over
the
wall
somewhere,
or
broken
through
at
the
postern.
She
jumped
down
beside
Gendry,
landing
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her.
The
night
rang
to
the
clash
of
steel
and
the
cries
of
the
wounded
and
dying.
For
a
moment
Arya
stood
uncertain,
not
knowing
which
way
to
go.
Death
was
all
around
her.

And
then
Yoren
was
there,
shaking
her,
screaming
in
her
face.
“Boy!”
he
yelled,
the
way
he
always
yelled
it.
“Get
out,
it’s
done,
we’ve
lost.
Herd
up
all
you
can,
you
and
him
and
the
others,
the
boys,
you
get
them
out.
Now!”

“How?”
Arya
said.

“That
trap,”
he
screamed.
“Under
the
barn.”

Quick
as
that
he
was
gone,
off
to
fight,
sword
in
hand.
Arya
grabbed
Gendry
by
the
arm.
“He
said
go,”
she
shouted,
“the
barn,
the
way
out.”
Through
the
slits
of
his
helm,
the
Bull’s
eyes
shone
with
reflected
fire.
He
nodded.
They
called
Hot
Pie
down
from
the
wall
and
found
Lommy
Greenhands
where
he
lay
bleeding
from
a
spear
thrust
through
his
calf.
They
found
Gerren
too,
but
he
was
hurt
too
bad
to
move.
As
they
were
running
toward
the
barn,
Arya
spied
the
crying
girl
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
chaos,
surrounded
by
smoke
and
slaughter.
She
grabbed
her
by
the
hand
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
as
the
others
raced
ahead.
The
girl
wouldn’t
walk,
even
when
slapped.
Arya
dragged
her
with
her
right
hand
while
she
held
Needle
in
the
left.
Ahead,
the
night
was
a
sullen
red.
The
barn’s
on
fire,
she
thought.
Flames
were
licking
up
its
sides
from
where
a
torch
had
fallen
on
straw,
and
she
could
hear
the
screaming
of
the
animals
trapped
within.
Hot
Pie
stepped
out
of
the
barn.
“Arry,
come
on!
Lommy’s
gone,
leave
her
if
she
won’t
come!”

Stubbornly,
Arya
dragged
all
the
harder,
pulling
the
crying
girl
along.
Hot
Pie
scuttled
back
inside,
abandoning
them…
but
Gendry
came
back,
the
fire
shining
so
bright
on
his
polished
helm
that
the
horns
seemed
to
glow
orange.
He
ran
to
them,
and
hoisted
the
crying
girl
up
over
his
shoulder.
“Run!”

Rushing
through
the
barn
doors
was
like
running
into
a
furnace.
The
air
was
swirling
with
smoke,
the
back
wall
a
sheet
of
fire
ground
to
roof.
Their
horses
and
donkeys
were
kicking
and
rearing
and
screaming.
The
poor
animals,
Arya
thought.
Then
she
saw
the
wagon,
and
the
three
men
manacled
to
its
bed.
Biter
was
flinging
himself
against
the
chains,
blood
running
down
his
arms
from
where
the
irons
clasped
his
wrists.
Rorge
screamed
curses,
kicking
at
the
wood.
“Boy!”
called
Jaqen
H’ghar.
“Sweet
boy!”

The
open
trap
was
only
a
few
feet
ahead,
but
the
fire
was
spreading
fast,
consuming
the
old
wood
and
dry
straw
faster
than
she
would
have
believed.
Arya
remembered
the
Hound’s
horrible
burned
face.
“Tunnel’s
narrow,”
Gendry
shouted.
“How
do
we
get
her
through?”

“Pull
her,”
Arya
said.
“Push
her.”

“Good
boys,
kind
boys,”
called
Jaqen
H’ghar,
coughing.

“Get
these
fucking
chains
off!”
Rorge
screamed.

Gendry
ignored
them.
“You
go
first,
then
her,
then
me.
Hurry,
it’s
a
long
way.”

“When
you
split
the
firewood,”
Arya
remembered,
“where
did
you
leave
the
axe?”

“Out
by
the
haven.”
He
spared
a
glance
for
the
chained
men.
“I’d
save
the
donkeys
first.
There’s
no
time.”

“You
take
her!”
she
yelled.
“You
get
her
out!
You
do
it!”
The
fire
beat
at
her
back
with
hot
red
wings
as
she
fled
the
burning
barn.
It
felt
blessedly
cool
outside,
but
men
were
dying
all
around
her.
She
saw
Koss
throw
down
his
blade
to
yield,
and
she
saw
them
kill
him
where
he
stood.
Smoke
was
everywhere.
There
was
no
sign
of
Yoren,
but
the
axe
was
where
Gendry
had
left
it,
by
the
woodpile
outside
the
haven.
As
she
wrenched
it
free,
a
mailed
hand
grabbed
her
arm.
Spinning,
Arya
drove
the
head
of
the
axe
hard
between
his
legs.
She
never
saw
his
face,
only
the
dark
blood
seeping
between
the
links
of
his
hauberk.
Going
back
into
that
barn
was
the
hardest
thing
she
ever
did.
Smoke
was
pouring
out
the
open
door
like
a
writhing
black
snake,
and
she
could
hear
the
screams
of
the
poor
animals
inside,
donkeys
and
horses
and
men.
She
chewed
her
lip,
and
darted
through
the
doors,
crouched
low
where
the
smoke
wasn’t
quite
so
thick.

A
donkey
was
caught
in
a
ring
of
fire,
shrieking
in
terror
and
pain.
She
could
smell
the
stench
of
burning
hair.
The
roof
was
gone
up
too,
and
things
were
falling
down,
pieces
of
flaming
wood
and
bits
of
straw
and
hay.
Arya
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth
and
nose.
She
couldn’t
see
the
wagon
for
the
smoke,
but
she
could
still
hear
Biter
screaming.
She
crawled
toward
the
sound.

And
then
a
wheel
was
looming
over
her.
The
wagon
jumped
and
moved
a
half
foot
when
Biter
threw
himself
against
his
chains
again.
Jaqen
saw
her,
but
it
was
too
hard
to
breathe,
let
alone
talk.
She
threw
the
axe
into
the
wagon.
Rorge
caught
it
and
lifted
it
over
his
head,
rivers
of
sooty
sweat
pouring
down
his
noseless
face.
Arya
was
running,
coughing.
She
heard
the
steel
crash
through
the
old
wood,
and
again,
again.
An
instant
later
came
a
crack
as
loud
as
thunder,
and
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
came
ripping
loose
in
an
explosion
of
splinters.

Arya
rolled
headfirst
into
the
tunnel
and
dropped
five
feet.
She
got
dirt
in
her
mouth
but
she
didn’t
care,
the
taste
was
fine,
the
taste
was
mud
and
water
and
worms
and
life.
Under
the
earth
the
air
was
cool
and
dark.
Above
was
nothing
but
blood
and
roaring
red
and
choking
smoke
and
the
screams
of
dying
horses.
She
moved
her
belt
around
so
Needle
would
not
be
in
her
way,
and
began
to
crawl.
A
dozen
feet
down
the
tunnel
she
heard
the
sound,
like
the
roar
of
some
monstrous
beast,
and
a
cloud
of
hot
smoke
and
black
dust
came
billowing
up
behind
her,
smelling
of
hell.
Arya
held
her
breath
and
kissed
the
mud
on
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
and
cried.
For
whom,
she
could
not
say.





TYRION

The
queen
was
not
disposed
to
wait
on
Varys.
“Treason
is
vile
enough,”
she
declared
furiously,
“but
this
is
barefaced
naked
villainy,
and
I
do
not
need
that
mincing
eunuch
to
tell
me
what
must
be
done
with
villains.”

Tyrion
took
the
letters
from
his
sister’s
hand
and
compared
them
side
by
side.
There
were
two
copies,
the
words
exactly
alike,
though
they
had
been
written
by
different
hands.

“Maester
Frenken
received
the
first
missive
at
Castle
Stokeworth,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
explained.
“The
second
copy
came
through
Lord
Gyles.”

Littlefinger
fingered
his
beard.
“If
Stannis
bothered
with
them,
it’s
past
certain
every
other
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
saw
a
copy
as
well.”

“I
want
these
letters
burned,
every
one,”
Cersei
declared.
“No
hint
of
this
must
reach
my
son’s
ears,
or
my
father’s.”

“I
imagine
Father’s
heard
rather
more
than
a
hint
by
now,”
Tyrion
said
dryly.
“Doubtless
Stannis
sent
a
bird
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
another
to
Harrenhal.
As
for
burning
the
letters,
to
what
point?
The
song
is
sung,
the
wine
is
spilled,
the
wench
is
pregnant.
And
this
is
not
as
dire
as
it
seems,
in
truth.”

Cersei
turned
on
him
in
green-eyed
fury.
“Are
you
utterly
witless?
Did
you
read
what
he
says?
The
boy
Joffrey,
he
calls
him.
And
he
dares
to
accuse
me
of
incest,
adultery,
and
treason!”

Only
because
you’re
guilty.
It
was
astonishing
to
see
how
angry
Cersei
could
wax
over
accusations
she
knew
perfectly
well
to
be
true.
If
we
lose
the
war,
she
ought
to
take
up
mummery,
she
has
a
gift
for
it.
Tyrion
waited
until
she
was
done
and
said,
“Stannis
must
have
some
pretext
to
justify
his
rebellion.
What
did
you
expect
him
to
write?
‘Joffrey
is
my
brother’s
trueborn
son
and
heir,
but
I
mean
to
take
his
throne
for
all
that’?”

“I
will
not
suffer
to
be
called
a
whore!”

Why,
sister,
he
never
claims
Jaime
paid
you.
Tyrion
made
a
show
of
glancing
over
the
writing
again.
There
had
been
some
niggling
phrase…“Done
in
the
Light
of
the
Lord,”
he
read.
“A
queer
choice
of
words,
that.”

Pycelle
cleared
his
throat.
“These
words
often
appear
in
letters
and
documents
from
the
Free
Cities.
They
mean
no
more
than,
let
us
say,
written
in
the
sight
of
god.
The
god
of
the
red
priests.
It
is
their
usage,
I
do
believe.”

“Varys
told
us
some
years
past
that
Lady
Selyse
had
taken
up
with
a
red
priest,”
Littlefinger
reminded
them.

Tyrion
tapped
the
paper.
“And
now
it
would
seem
her
lord
husband
has
done
the
same.
We
can
use
that
against
him.
Urge
the
High
Septon
to
reveal
how
Stannis
has
turned
against
the
gods
as
well
as
his
rightful
king…”

“Yes,
yes,”
the
queen
said
impatiently,
“but
first
we
must
stop
this
filth
from
spreading
further.
The
council
must
issue
an
edict.
Any
man
heard
speaking
of
incest
or
calling
Joff
a
bastard
should
lose
his
tongue
for
it.”

“A
prudent
measure,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
his
chain
of
office
clinking
as
he
nodded.

“A
folly,”
sighed
Tyrion.
“When
you
tear
out
a
man’s
tongue,
you
are
not
proving
him
a
liar,
you’re
only
telling
the
world
that
you
fear
what
he
might
say.”

“So
what
would
you
have
us
do?”
his
sister
demanded.

“Very
little.
Let
them
whisper,
they’ll
grow
bored
with
the
tale
soon
enough.
Any
man
with
a
thimble
of
sense
will
see
it
for
a
clumsy
attempt
to
justify
usurping
the
crown.
Does
Stannis
offer
proof?
How
could
he,
when
it
never
happened?”
Tyrion
gave
his
sister
his
sweetest
smile.

“That’s
so,”
she
had
to
say.
“Still…”

“Your
Grace,
your
brother
has
the
right
of
this.”
Petyr
Baelish
steepled
his
fingers.
“If
we
attempt
to
silence
this
talk,
we
only
lend
it
credence.
Better
to
treat
it
with
contempt,
like
the
pathetic
lie
it
is.
And
meantime,
fight
fire
with
fire.”

Cersei
gave
him
a
measuring
look.
“What
sort
of
fire?”

“A
tale
of
somewhat
the
same
nature,
perhaps.
But
more
easily
believed.
Lord
Stannis
has
spent
most
of
his
marriage
apart
from
his
wife.
Not
that
I
fault
him,
I’d
do
the
same
were
I
married
to
Lady
Selyse.
Nonetheless,
if
we
put
it
about
that
her
daughter
is
baseborn
and
Stannis
a
cuckold,
well…
the
smallfolk
are
always
eager
to
believe
the
worst
of
their
lords,
particularly
those
as
stern,
sour,
and
prickly
proud
as
Stannis
Baratheon.”

“He
has
never
been
much
loved,
that’s
true.”
Cersei
considered
a
moment.
“So
we
pay
him
back
in
his
own
coin.
Yes,
I
like
this.
Who
can
we
name
as
Lady
Selyse’s
lover?
She
has
two
brothers,
I
believe.
And
one
of
her
uncles
has
been
with
her
on
Dragonstone
all
this
time…”

“Ser
Axell
Florent
is
her
castellan.”
Loath
as
Tyrion
was
to
admit
it,
Littlefinger’s
scheme
had
promise.
Stannis
had
never
been
enamored
of
his
wife,
but
he
was
bristly
as
a
hedgehog
where
his
honor
was
concerned
and
mistrustful
by
nature.
If
they
could
sow
discord
between
him
and
his
followers,
it
could
only
help
their
cause.
“The
child
has
the
Florent
ears,
I’m
told.”

Littlefinger
gestured
languidly.
“A
trade
envoy
from
Lys
once
observed
to
me
that
Lord
Stannis
must
love
his
daughter
very
well,
since
he’d
erected
hundreds
of
statues
of
her
all
along
the
walls
of
Dragonstone.
‘My
lord’
I
had
to
tell
him,
‘those
are
gargoyles.’”
He
chuckled.
“Ser
Axell
might
serve
for
Shireen’s
father,
but
in
my
experience,
the
more
bizarre
and
shocking
a
tale
the
more
apt
it
is
to
be
repeated.
Stannis
keeps
an
especially
grotesque
fool,
a
lackwit
with
a
tattooed
face.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
gaped
at
him,
aghast.
“Surely
you
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
Lady
Selyse
would
bring
a
fool
into
her
bed?”

“You’d
have
to
be
a
fool
to
want
to
bed
Selyse
Florent,”
said
Littlefinger.
“Doubtless
Patchface
reminded
her
of
Stannis.
And
the
best
lies
contain
within
them
nuggets
of
truth,
enough
to
give
a
listener
pause.
As
it
happens,
this
fool
is
utterly
devoted
to
the
girl
and
follows
her
everywhere.
They
even
look
somewhat
alike.
Shireen
has
a
mottled,
half-frozen
face
as
well.”

Pycelle
was
lost.
“But
that
is
from
the
greyscale
that
near
killed
her
as
a
babe,
poor
thing.”

“I
like
my
tale
better,”
said
Littlefinger,
“and
so
will
the
smallfolk.
Most
of
them
believe
that
if
a
woman
eats
rabbit
while
pregnant,
her
child
will
be
born
with
long
floppy
ears.”

Cersei
smiled
the
sort
of
smile
she
customarily
reserved
for
Jaime.
“Lord
Petyr,
you
are
a
wicked
creature.”

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace.”

“And
a
most
accomplished
liar,”
Tyrion
added,
less
warmly.
This
one
is
more
dangerous
than
I
knew,
he
reflected.

Littlefinger’s
grey-green
eyes
met
the
dwarf’s
mismatched
stare
with
no
hint
of
unease.
“We
all
have
our
gifts,
my
lord.”

The
queen
was
too
caught
up
in
her
revenge
to
take
note
of
the
exchange.
“Cuckolded
by
a
halfwit
fool!
Stannis
will
be
laughed
at
in
every
winesink
this
side
of
the
narrow
sea.”

“The
story
should
not
come
from
us,”
Tyrion
said,
“or
it
will
be
seen
for
a
self-serving
lie.”
Which
it
is,
to
be
sure.

Once
more
Littlefinger
supplied
the
answer.
“Whores
love
to
gossip,
and
as
it
happens
I
own
a
brothel
or
three.
And
no
doubt
Varys
can
plant
seeds
in
the
alehouses
and
pot-shops.”

“Varys,”
Cersei
said,
frowning.
“Where
is
Varys?”

“I
have
been
wondering
about
that
myself,
Your
Grace.”

“The
Spider
spins
his
secret
webs
day
and
night,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said
ominously.
“I
mistrust
that
one,
my
lords.”

“And
he
speaks
so
kindly
of
you.”
Tyrion
pushed
himself
off
his
chair.
As
it
happened,
he
knew
what
the
eunuch
was
about,
but
it
was
nothing
the
other
councillors
needed
to
hear.
“Pray
excuse
me,
my
lords.
Other
business
calls.”

Cersei
was
instantly
suspicious.
“King’s
business?”

“Nothing
you
need
trouble
yourself
about.”

“I’ll
be
the
judge
of
that.”

“Would
you
spoil
my
surprise?”
Tyrion
said.
“I’m
having
a
gift
made
for
Joffrey.
A
little
chain.”

“What
does
he
need
with
another
chain?
He
has
gold
chains
and
silver,
more
than
he
can
wear.
If
you
think
for
a
moment
you
can
buy
Joff’s
love
with
gifts—”

“Why,
surely
I
have
the
king’s
love,
as
he
has
mine.
And
this
chain
I
believe
he
may
one
day
treasure
above
all
others.”
The
little
man
bowed
and
waddled
to
the
door.

Bronn
was
waiting
outside
the
council
chambers
to
escort
him
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“The
smiths
are
in
your
audience
chamber,
waiting
your
pleasure,”
he
said
as
they
crossed
the
ward.

“Waiting
my
pleasure.
I
like
the
ring
of
that,
Bronn.
You
almost
sound
a
proper
courtier.
Next
you’ll
be
kneeling.”

“Fuck
you,
dwarf.”

“That’s
Shae’s
task.”
Tyrion
heard
Lady
Tanda
calling
to
him
merrily
from
the
top
of
the
serpentine
steps.
Pretending
not
to
notice
her,
he
waddled
a
bit
faster.
“See
that
my
litter
is
readied,
I’ll
be
leaving
the
castle
as
soon
as
I’m
done
here.”
Two
of
the
Moon
Brothers
had
the
door
guard.
Tyrion
greeted
them
pleasantly,
and
grimaced
before
starting
up
the
stairs.
The
climb
to
his
bedchamber
made
his
legs
ache.

Within
he
found
a
boy
of
twelve
laying
out
clothing
on
the
bed;
his
squire,
such
that
he
was.
Podrick
Payne
was
so
shy
he
was
furtive.
Tyrion
had
never
quite
gotten
over
the
suspicion
that
his
father
had
inflicted
the
boy
on
him
as
a
joke.

“Your
garb,
my
lord,”
the
boy
mumbled
when
Tyrion
entered,
staring
down
at
his
boots.
Even
when
he
worked
up
the
courage
to
speak,
Pod
could
never
quite
manage
to
look
at
you.
“For
the
audience.
And
your
chain.
The
Hand’s
chain.”

“Very
good.
Help
me
dress.”
The
doublet
was
black
velvet
covered
with
golden
studs
in
the
shape
of
lions’
heads,
the
chain
a
loop
of
solid
gold
hands,
the
fingers
of
each
clasping
the
wrist
of
the
next.
Pod
brought
him
a
cloak
of
crimson
silk
fringed
in
gold,
cut
to
his
height.
On
a
normal
man,
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
half
cape.

The
Hand’s
private
audience
chamber
was
not
so
large
as
the
king’s,
nor
a
patch
on
the
vastness
of
the
throne
room,
but
Tyrion
liked
its
Myrish
rugs,
wall
hangings,
and
sense
of
intimacy.
As
he
entered,
his
steward
cried
out,
“Tyrion
Lannister,
Hand
of
the
King.”
He
liked
that
too.
The
gaggle
of
smiths,
armorers,
and
ironmongers
that
Bronn
had
collected
fell
to
their
knees.

He
hoisted
himself
up
into
the
high
seat
under
the
round
golden
window
and
bid
them
rise.
“Goodmen,
I
know
you
are
all
busy,
so
I
will
be
succinct.
Pod,
if
you
please.”
The
boy
handed
him
a
canvas
sack.
Tyrion
yanked
the
drawstring
and
upended
the
bag.
Its
contents
spilled
onto
the
rug
with
a
muffled
thunk
of
metal
on
wool.
“I
had
these
made
at
the
castle
forge.
I
want
a
thousand
more
just
like
them.”

One
of
the
smiths
knelt
to
inspect
the
object:
three
immense
steel
links,
twisted
together.
“A
mighty
chain.”

“Mighty,
but
short,”
the
dwarf
replied.
“Somewhat
like
me.
I
fancy
one
a
good
deal
longer.
Do
you
have
a
name?”

“They
call
me
Ironbelly,
m’lord.”
The
smith
was
squat
and
broad,
plainly
dressed
in
wool
and
leather,
but
his
arms
were
as
thick
as
a
bull’s
neck.

“I
want
every
forge
in
King’s
Landing
turned
to
making
these
links
and
joining
them.
All
other
work
is
to
be
put
aside.
I
want
every
man
who
knows
the
art
of
working
metal
set
to
this
task,
be
he
master,
journeyman,
or
apprentice.
When
I
ride
up
the
Street
of
Steel,
I
want
to
hear
hammers
ringing,
night
or
day.
And
I
want
a
man,
a
strong
man,
to
see
that
all
this
is
done.
Are
you
that
man,
Goodman
Ironbelly?”

“Might
be
I
am,
m’lord.
But
what
of
the
mail
and
swords
the
queen
was
wanting?”

Another
smith
spoke
up.
“Her
Grace
commanded
us
to
make
chainmail
and
armor,
swords
and
daggers
and
axes,
all
in
great
numbers.
For
arming
her
new
gold
cloaks,
m’lord.”

“That
work
can
wait,”
Tyrion
said.
“The
chain
first.”

“M’lord,
begging
your
pardon,
Her
Grace
said
those
as
didn’t
meet
their
numbers
would
have
their
hands
crushed,”
the
anxious
Smith
persisted.
“Smashed
on
their
own
anvils,
she
said.”

Sweet
Cersei,
always
striving
to
make
the
smallfolk
love
us.
“No
one
will
have
their
hands
smashed.
You
have
my
word
on
it.”

“Iron
is
grown
dear,”
Ironbelly
declared,
“and
this
chain
will
be
needing
much
of
it,
and
coke
beside,
for
the
fires.”

“Lord
Baelish
will
see
that
you
have
coin
as
you
need
it,”
Tyrion
promised.
He
could
count
on
Littlefinger
for
that
much,
he
hoped.
“I
will
command
the
City
Watch
to
help
you
find
iron.
Melt
down
every
horseshoe
in
this
city
if
you
must.”

An
older
man
moved
forward,
richly
dressed
in
a
damask
tunic
with
silver
fastenings
and
a
cloak
lined
with
foxfur.
He
knelt
to
examine
the
great
steel
links
Tyrion
had
dumped
on
the
floor.
“My
lord,”
he
announced
gravely,
“this
is
crude
work
at
best.
There
is
no
art
to
it.
Suitable
labor
for
common
smiths,
no
doubt,
for
men
who
bend
horseshoes
and
hammer
out
kettles,
but
I
am
a
master
armorer,
as
it
please
my
lord.
This
is
no
work
for
me,
nor
my
fellow
masters.
We
make
swords
as
sharp
as
song,
armor
such
as
a
god
might
wear.
Not
this.”

Tyrion
tilted
his
head
to
the
side
and
gave
the
man
a
dose
of
his
mismatched
eyes.
“What
is
your
name,
master
armorer?”

“Salloreon,
as
it
please
my
lord.
If
the
King’s
Hand
will
permit,
I
should
be
most
honored
to
forge
him
a
suit
of
armor
suitable
to
his
House
and
high
office.”
Two
of
the
others
sniggered,
but
Salloreon
plunged
ahead,
heedless.
“Plate
and
scale,
I
think.
The
scales
gilded
bright
as
the
sun,
the
plate
enameled
a
deep
Lannister
crimson.
I
would
suggest
a
demon’s
head
for
a
helm,
crowned
with
tall
golden
horns.
When
you
ride
into
battle,
men
will
shrink
away
in
fear.”

A
demon’s
head,
Tyrion
thought
ruefully,
now
what
does
that
say
of
me?
“Master
Salloreon,
I
plan
to
fight
the
rest
of
my
battles
from
this
chair.
It’s
links
I
need,
not
demon
horns.
So
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
You
will
make
chains,
or
you
will
wear
them.
The
choice
is
yours.”
He
rose,
and
took
his
leave
with
nary
a
backward
glance.

Bronn
was
waiting
by
the
gate
with
his
litter
and
an
escort
of
mounted
Black
Ears.
“You
know
where
we’re
bound,”
Tyrion
told
him.
He
accepted
a
hand
up
into
the
litter.
He
had
done
all
he
could
to
feed
the
hungry
city—he’d
set
several
hundred
carpenters
to
building
fishing
boats
in
place
of
catapults,
opened
the
kingswood
to
any
hunter
who
dared
to
cross
the
river,
even
sent
gold
cloaks
foraging
to
the
west
and
south—yet
he
still
saw
accusing
eyes
everywhere
he
rode.
The
litter’s
curtains
shielded
him
from
that,
and
besides
gave
him
leisure
to
think.

As
they
wound
their
slow
way
down
twisty
Shadowblack
Lane
to
the
foot
of
Aegon’s
High
Hill,
Tyrion
reflected
on
the
events
of
the
morning.
His
sister’s
ire
had
led
her
to
overlook
the
true
significance
of
Stannis
Baratheon’s
letter.
Without
proof,
his
accusations
were
nothing;
what
mattered
was
that
he
had
named
himself
a
king.
And
what
will
Renly
make
of
that?
They
could
not
both
sit
the
Iron
Throne.

Idly,
he
pushed
the
curtain
back
a
few
inches
to
peer
out
at
the
streets.
Black
Ears
rode
on
both
sides
of
him,
their
grisly
necklaces
looped
about
their
throats,
while
Bronn
went
in
front
to
clear
the
way.
He
watched
the
passersby
watching
him,
and
played
a
little
game
with
himself,
trying
to
sort
the
informers
from
the
rest.
The
ones
who
look
the
most
suspicious
are
likely
innocent,
he
decided.
It’s
the
ones
who
look
innocent
I
need
to
beware.

His
destination
was
behind
the
hill
of
Rhaenys,
and
the
streets
were
crowded.
Almost
an
hour
had
passed
before
the
litter
swayed
to
a
stop.
Tyrion
was
dozing,
but
he
woke
abruptly
when
the
motion
ceased,
rubbed
the
sand
from
his
eyes,
and
accepted
Bronn’s
hand
to
climb
down.

The
house
was
two
stories
tall,
stone
below
and
timber
above.
A
round
turret
rose
from
one
corner
of
the
structure.
Many
of
the
windows
were
leaded.
Over
the
door
swung
an
ornate
lamp,
a
globe
of
gilded
metal
and
scarlet
glass.

“A
brothel,”
Bronn
said.
“What
do
you
mean
to
do
here?”

“What
does
one
usually
do
in
a
brothel?”

The
sellsword
laughed.
“Shae’s
not
enough?”

“She
was
pretty
enough
for
a
camp
follower,
but
I’m
no
longer
in
camp.
Little
men
have
big
appetites,
and
I’m
told
the
girls
here
are
fit
for
a
king.”

“Is
the
boy
old
enough?”

“Not
Joffrey.
Robert.
This
house
was
a
great
favorite
of
his.”
Although
Joffrey
may
indeed
be
old
enough.
An
interesting
notion,
that.
“If
you
and
the
Black
Ears
care
to
amuse
yourselves,
feel
free,
but
Chataya’s
girls
are
costly.
You’ll
find
cheaper
houses
all
along
the
street.
Leave
one
man
here
who’ll
know
where
to
find
the
others
when
I
wish
to
return.”

Bronn
nodded.
“As
you
say.”
The
Black
Ears
were
all
grins.

Inside
the
door,
a
tall
woman
in
flowing
silks
was
waiting
for
him.
She
had
ebon
skin
and
sandalwood
eyes.
“I
am
Chataya,”
she
announced,
bowing
deeply.
“And
you
are—”

“Let
us
not
get
into
the
habit
of
names.
Names
are
dangerous.”
The
air
smelled
of
some
exotic
spice,
and
the
floor
beneath
his
feet
displayed
a
mosaic
of
two
women
entwined
in
love.
“You
have
a
pleasant
establishment.”

“I
have
labored
long
to
make
it
so.
I
am
glad
the
Hand
is
pleased.”
Her
voice
was
flowing
amber,
liquid
with
the
accents
of
the
distant
Summer
Isles.

“Titles
can
be
as
dangerous
as
names,”
Tyrion
warned.
“Show
me
a
few
of
your
girls.”

“It
will
be
my
great
delight.
You
will
find
that
they
are
all
as
sweet
as
they
are
beautiful,
and
skilled
in
every
art
of
love.”
She
swept
off
gracefully,
leaving
Tyrion
to
waddle
after
as
best
he
could
on
legs
half
the
length
of
hers.

From
behind
an
ornate
Myrish
screen
carved
with
flowers
and
fancies
and
dreaming
maidens,
they
peered
unseen
into
a
common
room
where
an
old
man
was
playing
a
cheerful
air
on
the
pipes.
In
a
cushioned
alcove,
a
drunken
Tyroshi
with
a
purple
beard
dandled
a
buxom
young
wench
on
his
knee.
He’d
unlaced
her
bodice
and
was
tilting
his
cup
to
pour
a
thin
trickle
of
wine
over
her
breasts
so
he
might
lap
it
off.
Two
other
girls
sat
playing
at
tiles
before
a
leaded
glass
window.
The
freckled
one
wore
a
chain
of
blue
flowers
in
her
honeyed
hair.
The
other
had
skin
as
smooth
and
black
as
polished
jet,
wide
dark
eyes,
small
pointed
breasts.
They
dressed
in
flowing
silks
cinched
at
the
waist
with
beaded
belts.
The
sunlight
pouring
through
the
colored
glass
outlined
their
sweet
young
bodies
through
the
thin
cloth,
and
Tyrion
felt
a
stirring
in
his
groin.
“I
would
respectfully
suggest
the
dark-skinned
girl,”
said
Chataya.

“She’s
young.”

“She
has
sixteen
years,
my
lord.”

A
good
age
for
Joffrey,
he
thought,
remembering
what
Bronn
had
said.
His
first
had
been
even
younger.
Tyrion
remembered
how
shy
she’d
seemed
as
he
drew
her
dress
up
over
her
head
the
first
time.
Long
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
you
could
drown
in,
and
he
had.
So
long
ago…
What
a
wretched
fool
you
are,
dwarf.
“Does
she
come
from
your
home
lands,
this
girl?”

“Her
blood
is
the
blood
of
summer,
my
lord,
but
my
daughter
was
born
here
in
King’s
Landing.”
His
surprise
must
have
shown
on
his
face,
for
Chataya
continued,
“My
people
hold
that
there
is
no
shame
to
be
found
in
the
pillow
house.
In
the
Summer
Isles,
those
who
are
skilled
at
giving
pleasure
are
greatly
esteemed.
Many
highborn
youths
and
maidens
serve
for
a
few
years
after
their
flowerings,
to
honor
the
gods.”

“What
do
the
gods
have
to
do
with
it?”

“The
gods
made
our
bodies
as
well
as
our
souls,
is
it
not
so?
They
give
us
voices,
so
we
might
worship
them
with
song.
They
give
us
hands,
so
we
might
build
them
temples.
And
they
give
us
desire,
so
we
might
mate
and
worship
them
in
that
way.”

“Remind
me
to
tell
the
High
Septon,”
said
Tyrion.
“If
I
could
pray
with
my
cock,
I’d
be
much
more
religious.”
He
waved
a
hand.
“I
will
gladly
accept
your
suggestion.”

“I
shall
summon
my
daughter.
Come.”

The
girl
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs.
Taller
than
Shae,
though
not
so
tall
as
her
mother,
she
had
to
kneel
before
Tyrion
could
kiss
her.
“My
name
is
Alayaya,”
she
said,
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
her
mother’s
accent.
“Come,
my
lord.”
She
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
up
two
flights
of
stairs,
then
down
a
long
hall.
Gasps
and
shrieks
of
pleasure
were
coming
from
behind
one
of
the
closed
doors,
giggles
and
whispers
from
another.
Tyrion’s
cock
pressed
against
the
lacings
of
his
breeches.
This
could
be
humiliating,
he
thought
as
he
followed
Alayaya
up
another
stair
to
the
turret
room.
There
was
only
one
door.
She
led
him
through
and
closed
it.
Within
the
room
was
a
great
canopied
bed,
a
tall
wardrobe
decorated
with
erotic
carvings,
and
a
narrow
window
of
leaded
glass
in
a
pattern
of
red
and
yellow
diamonds.

“You
are
very
beautiful,
Alayaya,”
Tyrion
told
her
when
they
were
alone.
“From
head
to
heels,
every
part
of
you
is
lovely.
Yet
just
now
the
part
that
interests
me
most
is
your
tongue.”

“My
lord
will
find
my
tongue
well
schooled.
When
I
was
a
girl
I
learned
when
to
use
it,
and
when
not.”

“That
pleases
me.”
Tyrion
smiled.
“So
what
shall
we
do
now?
Perchance
you
have
some
suggestion?”

“Yes,”
she
said.
“If
my
lord
will
open
the
wardrobe,
he
will
find
what
he
seeks.”

Tyrion
kissed
her
hand,
and
climbed
inside
the
empty
wardrobe.
Alayaya
closed
it
after
him.
He
groped
for
the
back
panel,
felt
it
slide
under
his
fingers,
and
pushed
it
all
the
way
aside.
The
hollow
space
behind
the
walls
was
pitch-black,
but
he
fumbled
until
he
felt
metal.
His
hand
closed
around
the
rung
of
a
ladder.
He
found
a
lower
rung
with
his
foot,
and
started
down.
Well
below
street
level,
the
shaft
opened
onto
a
slanting
earthen
tunnel,
where
he
found
Varys
waiting
with
candle
in
hand.

Varys
did
not
look
at
all
like
himself.
A
scarred
face
and
a
stubble
of
dark
beard
showed
under
his
spiked
steel
cap,
and
he
wore
mail
over
boiled
leather,
dirk
and
shortsword
at
his
belt.
“Was
Chataya’s
to
your
satisfaction,
my
lord?”

“Almost
too
much
so,”
admitted
Tyrion.
“You’re
certain
this
woman
can
be
relied
on?”

“I
am
certain
of
nothing
in
this
fickle
and
treacherous
world,
my
lord.
Chataya
has
no
cause
to
love
the
queen,
though,
and
she
knows
that
she
has
you
to
thank
for
ridding
her
of
Allar
Deem.
Shall
we
go?”
He
started
down
the
tunnel.

Even
his
walk
is
different,
Tyrion
observed.
The
scent
of
sour
wine
and
garlic
clung
to
Varys
instead
of
lavender.
“I
like
this
new
garb
of
yours,”
he
offered
as
they
went.

“The
work
I
do
does
not
permit
me
to
travel
the
streets
amid
a
column
of
knights.
So
when
I
leave
the
castle,
I
adopt
more
suitable
guises,
and
thus
live
to
serve
you
longer.”

“Leather
becomes
you.
You
ought
to
come
like
this
to
our
next
council
session.”

“Your
sister
would
not
approve,
my
lord.”

“My
sister
would
soil
her
smallclothes.”
He
smiled
in
the
dark.
“I
saw
no
signs
of
any
of
her
spies
skulking
after
me.”

“I
am
pleased
to
hear
it,
my
lord.
Some
of
your
sister’s
hirelings
are
mine
as
well,
unbeknownst
to
her.
I
should
hate
to
think
they
had
grown
so
sloppy
as
to
be
seen.”

“Well,
I’d
hate
to
think
I
was
climbing
through
wardrobes
and
suffering
the
pangs
of
frustrated
lust
all
for
naught.”

“Scarcely
for
naught,”
Varys
assured
him.
“They
know
you
are
here.
Whether
any
will
be
bold
enough
to
enter
Chataya’s
in
the
guise
of
patrons
I
cannot
say,
but
I
find
it
best
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution.”

“How
is
it
a
brothel
happens
to
have
a
secret
entrance?”

“The
tunnel
was
dug
for
another
King’s
Hand,
whose
honor
would
not
allow
him
to
enter
such
a
house
openly.
Chataya
has
closely
guarded
the
knowledge
of
its
existence.”

“And
yet
you
knew
of
it.”

“Little
birds
fly
through
many
a
dark
tunnel.
Careful,
the
steps
are
steep.”

They
emerged
through
a
trap
at
the
back
of
a
stable,
having
come
perhaps
a
distance
of
three
blocks
under
Rhaenys’s
Hill.
A
horse
whickered
in
his
stall
when
Tyrion
let
the
door
slam
shut.
Varys
blew
out
the
candle
and
set
it
on
a
beam
and
Tyrion
gazed
about.
A
mule
and
three
horses
occupied
the
stalls.
He
waddled
over
to
the
piebald
gelding
and
took
a
look
at
his
teeth.
“Old,”
he
said,
“and
I
have
my
doubts
about
his
wind.”

“He
is
not
a
mount
to
carry
you
into
battle,
true,”
Varys
replied,
“but
he
will
serve,
and
attract
no
notice.
As
will
the
others.
And
the
stableboys
see
and
hear
only
the
animals.”
The
eunuch
took
a
cloak
from
a
peg.
It
was
roughspun,
sun-faded,
and
threadbare,
but
very
ample
in
its
cut.
“If
you
will
permit
me.”
When
he
swept
it
over
Tyrion’s
shoulders
it
enveloped
him
head
to
heel,
with
a
cowl
that
could
be
pulled
forward
to
drown
his
face
in
shadows.
“Men
see
what
they
expect
to
see,”
Varys
said
as
he
fussed
and
pulled.
“Dwarfs
are
not
so
common
a
sight
as
children,
so
a
child
is
what
they
will
see.
A
boy
in
an
old
cloak
on
his
father’s
horse,
going
about
his
father’s
business.
Though
it
would
be
best
if
you
came
most
often
by
night.”

“I
plan
to…
after
today.
At
the
moment,
though,
Shae
awaits
me.”
He
had
put
her
up
in
a
walled
manse
at
the
far
northeast
corner
of
King’s
Landing,
not
far
from
the
sea,
but
he
had
not
dared
visit
her
there
for
fear
of
being
followed.

“Which
horse
will
you
have?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“This
one
will
do
well
enough.”

“I
shall
saddle
him
for
you.”
Varys
took
tack
and
saddle
down
from
a
peg.

Tyrion
adjusted
the
heavy
cloak
and
paced
restlessly.
“You
missed
a
lively
council.
Stannis
has
crowned
himself,
it
seems.”

“I
know.”

“He
accuses
my
brother
and
sister
of
incest.
I
wonder
how
he
came
by
that
suspicion.”

“Perhaps
he
read
a
book
and
looked
at
the
color
of
a
bastard’s
hair,
as
Ned
Stark
did,
and
Jon
Arryn
before
him.
Or
perhaps
someone
whispered
it
in
his
ear.”
The
eunuch’s
laugh
was
not
his
usual
giggle,
but
deeper
and
more
throaty.

“Someone
like
you,
perchance?”

“Am
I
suspected?
It
was
not
me.”

“If
it
had
been,
would
you
admit
it?”

“No.
But
why
should
I
betray
a
secret
I
have
kept
so
long?
It
is
one
thing
to
deceive
a
king,
and
quite
another
to
hide
from
the
cricket
in
the
rushes
and
the
little
bird
in
the
chimney.
Besides,
the
bastards
were
there
for
all
to
see.”

“Robert’s
bastards?
What
of
them?”

“He
fathered
eight,
to
the
best
of
my
knowing,”
Varys
said
as
he
wrestled
with
the
saddle.
“Their
mothers
were
copper
and
honey,
chestnut
and
butter,
yet
the
babes
were
all
black
as
ravens…
and
as
ill-omened,
it
would
seem.
So
when
Joffrey,
Myrcella,
and
Tommen
slid
out
between
your
sister’s
thighs,
each
as
golden
as
the
sun,
the
truth
was
not
hard
to
glimpse.”

Tyrion
shook
his
head.
If
she
had
borne
only
one
child
for
her
husband,
it
would
have
been
enough
to
disarm
suspicion…
but
then
she
would
not
have
been
Cersei.
“If
you
were
not
this
whisperer,
who
was?”

“Some
traitor,
doubtless.”
Varys
tightened
the
cinch.

“Littlefinger?”

“I
named
no
name.”

Tyrion
let
the
eunuch
help
him
mount.
“Lord
Varys,”
he
said
from
the
saddle,
“sometimes
I
feel
as
though
you
are
the
best
friend
I
have
in
King’s
Landing,
and
sometimes
I
feel
you
are
my
worst
enemy.”

“How
odd.
I
think
quite
the
same
of
you.”





BRAN

Long
before
the
first
pale
fingers
of
light
pried
apart
Bran’s
shutters,
his
eyes
were
open.

There
were
guests
in
Winterfell,
visitors
come
for
the
harvest
feast.
This
morning
they
would
be
tilting
at
quintains
in
the
yard.
Once
that
prospect
would
have
filled
him
with
excitement,
but
that
was
before.

Not
now.
The
Walders
would
break
lances
with
the
squires
of
Lord
Manderly’s
escort,
but
Bran
would
have
no
part
of
it.
He
must
play
the
prince
in
his
father’s
solar.
“Listen,
and
it
may
be
that
you
will
learn
something
of
what
lordship
is
all
about,”
Maester
Luwin
had
said.

Bran
had
never
asked
to
be
a
prince.
It
was
knighthood
he
had
always
dreamed
of;
bright
armor
and
streaming
banners,
lance
and
sword,
a
warhorse
between
his
legs.
Why
must
he
waste
his
days
listening
to
old
men
speak
of
things
he
only
half
understood?
Because
you’re
broken,
a
voice
inside
reminded
him.
A
lord
on
his
cushioned
chair
might
be
crippled—the
Walders
said
their
grandfather
was
so
feeble
he
had
to
be
carried
everywhere
in
a
litter—but
not
a
knight
on
his
destrier.
Besides,
it
was
his
duty.
“You
are
your
brother’s
heir
and
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
reminding
him
of
how
Robb
used
to
sit
with
their
lord
father
when
his
bannermen
came
to
see
him.

Lord
Wyman
Manderly
had
arrived
from
White
Harbor
two
days
past,
traveling
by
barge
and
litter,
as
he
was
too
fat
to
sit
a
horse.
With
him
had
come
a
long
tail
of
retainers:
knights,
squires,
lesser
lords
and
ladies,
heralds,
musicians,
even
a
juggler,
all
aglitter
with
banners
and
surcoats
in
what
seemed
half
a
hundred
colors.
Bran
had
welcomed
them
to
Winterfell
from
his
father’s
high
stone
seat
with
the
direwolves
carved
into
the
arms,
and
afterward
Ser
Rodrik
had
said
he’d
done
well.
If
that
had
been
the
end
of
it,
he
would
not
have
minded.
But
it
was
only
the
beginning.

“The
feast
makes
a
pleasant
pretext,”
Ser
Rodrik
explained,
“but
a
man
does
not
cross
a
hundred
leagues
for
a
sliver
of
duck
and
a
sip
of
wine.
Only
those
who
have
matters
of
import
to
set
before
us
are
like
to
make
the
journey.”

Bran
gazed
up
at
the
rough
stone
ceiling
above
his
head.
Robb
would
tell
him
not
to
play
the
boy,
he
knew.
He
could
almost
hear
him,
and
their
lord
father
as
well.
Winter
is
coming,
and
you
are
almost
a
man
grown,
Bran.
You
have
a
duty.

When
Hodor
came
bustling
in,
smiling
and
humming
tunelessly,
he
found
the
boy
resigned
to
his
fate.
Together
they
got
him
washed
and
brushed.
“The
white
wool
doublet
today,”
Bran
commanded.
“And
the
silver
brooch.
Ser
Rodrik
will
want
me
to
look
lordly.”
As
much
as
he
could,
Bran
preferred
to
dress
himself,
but
there
were
some
tasks—pulling
on
breeches,
lacing
his
boots—that
vexed
him.
They
went
quicker
with
Hodor’s
help.
Once
he
had
been
taught
to
do
something,
he
did
it
deftly.
His
hands
were
always
gentle,
though
his
strength
was
astonishing.
“You
could
have
been
a
knight
too,
I
bet,”
Bran
told
him.
“If
the
gods
hadn’t
taken
your
wits,
you
would
have
been
a
great
knight.”

“Hodor?”
Hodor
blinked
at
him
with
guileless
brown
eyes,
eyes
innocent
of
understanding.

“Yes,”
said
Bran.
“Hodor.”
He
pointed.

On
the
wall
beside
the
door
hung
a
basket,
stoutly
made
of
wicker
and
leather,
with
holes
cut
for
Bran’s
legs.
Hodor
slid
his
arms
through
the
straps
and
cinched
the
wide
belt
tight
around
his
chest,
then
knelt
beside
the
bed.
Bran
used
the
bars
sunk
into
the
wall
to
support
himself
as
he
swung
the
dead
weight
of
his
legs
into
the
basket
and
through
the
holes.

“Hodor,”
Hodor
said
again,
rising.
The
stableboy
stood
near
seven
feet
tall
all
by
himself;
on
his
back
Bran’s
head
almost
brushed
the
ceiling.
He
ducked
low
as
they
passed
through
the
door.
One
time
Hodor
smelled
bread
baking
and
ran
to
the
kitchens,
and
Bran
got
such
a
crack
that
Maester
Luwin
had
to
sew
up
his
scalp.
Mikken
had
given
him
a
rusty
old
visorless
helm
from
the
armory,
but
Bran
seldom
troubled
to
wear
it.
The
Walders
laughed
whenever
they
saw
it
on
his
head.

He
rested
his
hands
on
Hodor’s
shoulders
as
they
descended
the
winding
stair.
Outside,
the
sounds
of
sword
and
shield
and
horse
already
rang
through
the
yard.
It
made
a
sweet
music.
I’ll
just
have
a
look,
Bran
thought,
a
quick
look,
that’s
all.

The
White
Harbor
lordlings
would
emerge
later
in
the
morning,
with
their
knights
and
men-at-arms.
Until
then,
the
yard
belonged
to
their
squires,
who
ranged
in
age
from
ten
to
forty.
Bran
wished
he
were
one
of
them
so
badly
that
his
stomach
hurt
with
the
wanting.

Two
quintains
had
been
erected
in
the
courtyard,
each
a
stout
post
supporting
a
spinning
crossbeam
with
a
shield
at
one
end
and
a
padded
butt
at
the
other.
The
shields
had
been
painted
red-and-gold,
though
the
Lannister
lions
were
lumpy
and
misshapen,
and
already
well
scarred
by
the
first
boys
to
take
a
tilt
at
them.

The
sight
of
Bran
in
his
basket
drew
stares
from
those
who
had
not
seen
it
before,
but
he
had
learned
to
ignore
stares.
At
least
he
had
a
good
view;
on
Hodor’s
back,
he
towered
over
everyone.
The
Walders
were
mounting
up,
he
saw.
They’d
brought
fine
armor
up
from
the
Twins,
shining
silver
plate
with
enameled
blue
chasings.
Big
Walder’s
crest
was
shaped
like
a
castle,
while
Little
Walder
favored
streamers
of
blue
and
grey
silk.
Their
shields
and
surcoats
also
set
them
apart
from
each
other.
Little
Walder
quartered
the
twin
towers
of
Frey
with
the
brindled
boar
of
his
grandmother’s
House
and
the
plowman
of
his
mother’s:
Crakehall
and
Darry,
respectively.
Big
Walder’s
quarterings
were
the
tree-and-ravens
of
House
Blackwood
and
the
twining
snakes
of
the
Paeges.
They
must
be
hungry
for
honor,
Bran
thought
as
he
watched
them
take
up
their
lances.
A
Stark
needs
only
the
direwolf.

Their
dappled
grey
coursers
were
swift,
strong,
and
beautifully
trained.
Side
by
side
they
charged
the
quintains.
Both
hit
the
shields
cleanly
and
were
well
past
before
the
padded
butts
came
spinning
around.
Little
Walder
struck
the
harder
blow,
but
Bran
thought
Big
Walder
sat
his
horse
better.
He
would
have
given
both
his
useless
legs
for
the
chance
to
ride
against
either.

Little
Walder
cast
his
splintered
lance
aside,
spied
Bran,
and
reined
up.
“Now
there’s
an
ugly
horse,”
he
said
of
Hodor.

“Hodor’s
no
horse,”
Bran
said.

“Hodor,”
said
Hodor.

Big
Walder
trotted
up
to
join
his
cousin.
“Well,
he’s
not
as
smart
as
a
horse,
that’s
for
certain.”
A
few
of
the
White
Harbor
lads
poked
each
other
and
laughed.

“Hodor.”
Beaming
genially,
Hodor
looked
from
one
Frey
to
the
other,
oblivious
to
their
taunting.
“Hodor
hodor?”

Little
Walder’s
mount
whickered.
“See,
they’re
talking
to
each
other.
Maybe
hodor
means
‘I
love
you’
in
horse.”

“You
shut
up,
Frey.”
Bran
could
feel
his
color
rising.

Little
Walder
spurred
his
horse
closer,
giving
Hodor
a
bump
that
pushed
him
backward.
“What
will
you
do
if
I
don’t?”

“He’ll
set
his
wolf
on
you,
cousin,”
warned
Big
Walder.

“Let
him.
I
always
wanted
a
wolfskin
cloak.”

“Summer
would
tear
your
fat
head
off,”
Bran
said.

Little
Walder
banged
a
mailed
fist
against
his
breastplate.
“Does
your
wolf
have
steel
teeth,
to
bite
through
plate
and
mail?”

“Enough!”
Maester
Luwin’s
voice
cracked
through
the
clangor
of
the
yard
as
loud
as
a
thunderclap.
How
much
he
had
overheard,
Bran
could
not
say…
but
it
was
enough
to
anger
him,
clearly.
“These
threats
are
unseemly,
and
I’ll
hear
no
more
of
them.
Is
this
how
you
behave
at
the
Twins,
Walder
Frey?”

“If
I
want
to.”
Atop
his
courser,
Little
Walder
gave
Luwin
a
sullen
glare,
as
if
to
say,
You
are
only
a
maester,
who
are
you
to
reproach
a
Frey
of
the
Crossing?

“Well,
it
is
not
how
Lady
Stark’s
wards
ought
behave
at
Winterfell.
What’s
at
the
root
of
this?”
The
maester
looked
at
each
boy
in
turn.
“One
of
you
will
tell
me,
I
swear,
or—”

“We
were
having
a
jape
with
Hodor,”
confessed
Big
Walder.
“I
am
sorry
if
we
offended
Prince
Bran.
We
only
meant
to
be
amusing.”
He
at
least
had
the
grace
to
look
abashed.

Little
Walder
only
looked
peevish.
“And
me,”
he
said.
“I
was
only
being
amusing
too.”

The
bald
spot
atop
the
maester’s
head
had
turned
red,
Bran
could
see;
if
anything,
Luwin
was
more
angry
than
before.
“A
good
lord
comforts
and
protects
the
weak
and
helpless,”
he
told
the
Freys.
“I
will
not
have
you
making
Hodor
the
butt
of
cruel
jests,
do
you
hear
me?
He’s
a
goodhearted
lad,
dutiful
and
obedient,
which
is
more
than
I
can
say
for
either
of
you.”
The
maester
wagged
a
finger
at
Little
Walder.
“And
you
will
stay
out
of
the
godswood
and
away
from
those
wolves,
or
answer
for
it.”
Sleeves
flapping,
he
turned
on
his
heels,
stalked
off
a
few
paces,
and
glanced
back.
“Bran.
Come.
Lord
Wyman
awaits.”

“Hodor,
go
with
the
maester,”
Bran
commanded.

“Hodor,”
said
Hodor.
His
long
strides
caught
up
with
the
maester’s
furiously
pumping
legs
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Keep.
Maester
Luwin
held
the
door
open,
and
Bran
hugged
Hodor’s
neck
and
ducked
as
they
went
through.

“The
Walders—”
he
began.

“I’ll
hear
no
more
of
that,
it’s
done.”
Maester
Luwin
looked
worn-out
and
frayed.
“You
were
right
to
defend
Hodor,
but
you
should
never
have
been
there.
Ser
Rodrik
and
Lord
Wyman
have
broken
their
fast
already
while
they
waited
for
you.
Must
I
come
myself
to
fetch
you,
as
if
you
were
a
little
child?”

“No,”
Bran
said,
ashamed.
“I’m
sorry.
I
only
wanted…”

“I
know
what
you
wanted,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
more
gently.
“Would
that
it
could
be,
Bran.
Do
you
have
any
questions
before
we
begin
this
audience?”

“Will
we
talk
of
the
war?”

“You
will
talk
of
naught.”
The
sharpness
was
back
in
Luwin’s
voice.
“You
are
still
a
child
of
eight…”

“Almost
nine!”

“Eight,”
the
maester
repeated
firmly.
“Speak
nothing
but
courtesies
unless
Ser
Rodrik
or
Lord
Wyman
puts
you
a
question.”

Bran
nodded.
“I’ll
remember.”

“I
will
say
nothing
to
Ser
Rodrik
of
what
passed
between
you
and
the
Frey
boys.”

“Thank
you.”

They
put
Bran
in
his
father’s
oak
chair
with
the
grey
velvet
cushions,
behind
a
long
plank-and-trestle
table.
Ser
Rodrik
sat
on
his
right
hand
and
Maester
Luwin
to
his
left,
armed
with
quills
and
inkpots
and
a
sheaf
of
blank
parchment
to
write
down
all
that
transpired.
Bran
ran
a
hand
across
the
rough
wood
of
the
table
and
begged
Lord
Wyman’s
pardons
for
being
late.

“Why,
no
prince
is
ever
late,”
the
Lord
of
White
Harbor
responded
amiably.
“Those
who
arrive
before
him
have
come
early,
that’s
all.”
Wyman
Manderly
had
a
great
booming
laugh.
it
was
small
wonder
he
could
not
sit
a
saddle;
he
looked
as
if
he
outweighed
most
horses.
As
windy
as
he
was
vast,
he
began
by
asking
Winterfell
to
confirm
the
new
customs
officers
he
had
appointed
for
White
Harbor.
The
old
ones
had
been
holding
back
silver
for
King’s
Landing
rather
than
paying
it
over
to
the
new
King
in
the
North.
“King
Robb
needs
his
own
coinage
as
well,”
he
declared,
“and
White
Harbor
is
the
very
place
to
mint
it.”
He
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
matter,
as
it
please
the
king,
and
went
from
that
to
speak
of
how
he
had
strengthened
the
port’s
defenses,
detailing
the
cost
of
every
improvement.

In
addition
to
a
mint,
Lord
Manderly
also
proposed
to
build
Robb
a
warfleet.
“We
have
had
no
strength
at
sea
for
hundreds
of
years,
since
Brandon
the
Burner
put
the
torch
to
his
father’s
ships.
Grant
me
the
gold
and
within
the
year
I
will
float
you
sufficient
galleys
to
take
Dragonstone
and
King’s
Landing
both.”

Bran’s
interest
pricked
up
at
talk
of
warships.
No
one
asked
him,
but
he
thought
Lord
Wyman’s
notion
a
splendid
one.
In
his
mind’s
eye
he
could
see
them
already.
He
wondered
if
a
cripple
had
ever
commanded
a
warship.
But
Ser
Rodrik
promised
only
to
send
the
proposal
on
to
Robb
for
his
consideration,
while
Maester
Luwin
scratched
at
the
parchment.

Midday
came
and
went.
Maester
Luwin
sent
Poxy
Tym
down
to
the
kitchens,
and
they
dined
in
the
solar
on
cheese,
capons,
and
brown
oatbread.
While
tearing
apart
a
bird
with
fat
fingers,
Lord
Wyman
made
polite
inquiry
after
Lady
Hornwood,
who
was
a
cousin
of
his.
“She
was
born
a
Manderly,
you
know.
Perhaps,
when
her
grief
has
run
its
course,
she
would
like
to
be
a
Manderly
again,
eh?”
He
took
a
bite
from
a
wing,
and
smiled
broadly.
“As
it
happens,
I
am
a
widower
these
past
eight
years.
Past
time
I
took
another
wife,
don’t
you
agree,
my
lords?
A
man
does
get
lonely.”
Tossing
the
bones
aside,
he
reached
for
a
leg.
“Or
if
the
lady
fancies
a
younger
lad,
well,
my
son
Wendel
is
unwed
as
well.
He
is
off
south
guarding
Lady
Catelyn,
but
no
doubt
he
will
wish
to
take
a
bride
on
his
return.
A
valiant
boy,
and
jolly.
just
the
man
to
teach
her
to
laugh
again,
eh?”
He
wiped
a
bit
of
grease
off
his
chin
with
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic.

Bran
could
hear
the
distant
clash
of
arms
through
the
windows.
He
cared
nothing
about
marriages.
I
wish
I
was
down
in
the
yard.

His
lordship
waited
until
the
table
had
been
cleared
before
he
raised
the
matter
of
a
letter
he
had
received
from
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
who
held
his
elder
son,
Ser
Wylis,
taken
captive
on
the
Green
Fork.
“He
offers
him
back
to
me
without
ransom,
provided
I
withdraw
my
levies
from
His
Grace
and
vow
to
fight
no
more.”

“You
will
refuse
him,
of
course,”
said
Ser
Rodrik.

“Have
no
fear
on
that
count,”
the
lord
assured
them.
“King
Robb
has
no
more
loyal
servant
than
Wyman
Manderly.
I
would
be
loath
to
see
my
son
languish
at
Harrenhal
any
longer
than
he
must,
however.
That
is
an
ill
place.
Cursed,
they
say.
Not
that
I
am
the
sort
to
swallow
such
tales,
but
still,
there
it
is.
Look
at
what’s
befallen
this
Janos
Slynt.
Raised
up
to
Lord
of
Harrenhal
by
the
queen,
and
cast
down
by
her
brother.
Shipped
off
to
the
Wall,
they
say.
I
pray
some
equitable
exchange
of
captives
can
be
arranged
before
too
very
long.
I
know
Wylis
would
not
want
to
sit
out
the
rest
of
the
war.
Gallant,
that
son
of
mine,
and
fierce
as
a
mastiff.”

Bran’s
shoulders
were
stiff
from
sitting
in
the
same
chair
by
the
time
the
audience
drew
to
a
close.
And
that
night,
as
he
sat
to
supper,
a
horn
sounded
to
herald
the
arrival
of
another
guest.
Lady
Donella
Hornwood
brought
no
tail
of
knights
and
retainers;
only
herself,
and
six
tired
men-at-arms
with
a
moosehead
badge
on
their
dusty
orange
livery.
“We
are
very
sorry
for
all
you
have
suffered,
my
lady,”
Bran
said
when
she
came
before
him
to
speak
her
words
of
greetings.
Lord
Hornwood
had
been
killed
in
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork,
their
only
son
cut
down
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
“Winterfell
will
remember.”

“That
is
good
to
know.”
She
was
a
pale
husk
of
a
woman,
every
line
of
her
face
etched
with
grief.
“I
am
very
weary,
my
lord.
If
I
might
have
leave
to
rest,
I
should
be
thankful.”

“To
be
sure,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“There
is
time
enough
for
talk
on
the
morrow.”

When
the
morrow
came,
most
of
the
morning
was
given
over
to
talk
of
grains
and
greens
and
salting
meat.
Once
the
maesters
in
their
Citadel
had
proclaimed
the
first
of
autumn,
wise
men
put
away
a
portion
of
each
harvest…
though
how
large
a
portion
was
a
matter
that
seemed
to
require
much
talk.
Lady
Hornwood
was
storing
a
fifth
of
her
harvest.
At
Maester
Luwin’s
suggestion,
she
vowed
to
increase
that
to
a
quarter.

“Bolton’s
bastard
is
massing
men
at
the
Dreadfort,”
she
warned
them.
“I
hope
he
means
to
take
them
south
to
join
his
father
at
the
Twins,
but
when
I
sent
to
ask
his
intent,
he
told
me
that
no
Bolton
would
be
questioned
by
a
woman.
As
if
he
were
trueborn
and
had
a
right
to
that
name.”

“Lord
Bolton
has
never
acknowledged
the
boy,
so
far
as
I
know,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“I
confess,
I
do
not
know
him.”

“Few
do,”
she
replied.
“He
lived
with
his
mother
until
two
years
past,
when
young
Domeric
died
and
left
Bolton
without
an
heir.
That
was
when
he
brought
his
bastard
to
the
Dreadfort.
The
boy
is
a
sly
creature
by
all
accounts,
and
he
has
a
servant
who
is
almost
as
cruel
as
he
is.
Reek,
they
call
the
man.
It’s
said
he
never
bathes.
They
hunt
together,
the
Bastard
and
this
Reek,
and
not
for
deer.
I’ve
heard
tales,
things
I
can
scarce
believe,
even
of
a
Bolton.
And
now
that
my
lord
husband
and
my
sweet
son
have
gone
to
the
gods,
the
Bastard
looks
at
my
lands
hungrily.”

Bran
wanted
to
give
the
lady
a
hundred
men
to
defend
her
rights,
but
Ser
Rodrik
only
said,
“He
may
look,
but
should
he
do
more
I
promise
you
there
will
be
dire
retribution.
You
will
be
safe
enough,
my
lady…
though
perhaps
in
time,
when
your
grief
is
passed,
you
may
find
it
prudent
to
wed
again.”

“I
am
past
my
childbearing
years,
what
beauty
I
had
long
fled,”
she
replied
with
a
tired
half
smile,
“yet
men
come
sniffing
after
me
as
they
never
did
when
I
was
a
maid.”

“You
do
not
look
favorably
on
these
suitors?”
asked
Luwin.

“I
shall
wed
again
if
His
Grace
commands
it,”
Lady
Hornwood
replied,
“but
Mors
Crowfood
is
a
drunken
brute,
and
older
than
my
father.
As
for
my
noble
cousin
of
Manderly,
my
lord’s
bed
is
not
large
enough
to
hold
one
of
his
majesty,
and
I
am
surely
too
small
and
frail
to
lie
beneath
him.”

Bran
knew
that
men
slept
on
top
of
women
when
they
shared
a
bed.
Sleeping
under
Lord
Manderly
would
be
like
sleeping
under
a
fallen
horse,
he
imagined.
Ser
Rodrik
gave
the
widow
a
sympathetic
nod.
“You
will
have
other
suitors,
my
lady.
We
shall
try
and
find
you
a
prospect
more
to
your
taste.”

“Perhaps
you
need
not
look
very
far,
ser.”

After
she
had
taken
her
leave,
Maester
Luwin
smiled.
“Ser
Rodrik,
I
do
believe
my
lady
fancies
you.”

Ser
Rodrik
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
uncomfortable.

“She
was
very
sad,”
said
Bran.

Ser
Rodrik
nodded.
“Sad
and
gentle,
and
not
at
all
uncomely
for
a
woman
of
her
years,
for
all
her
modesty.
Yet
a
danger
to
the
peace
of
your
brother’s
realm
nonetheless.”

“Her?”
Bran
said,
astonished.

Maester
Luwin
answered.
“With
no
direct
heir,
there
are
sure
to
be
many
claimants
contending
for
the
Hornwood
lands.
The
Tallharts,
Flints,
and
Karstarks
all
have
ties
to
House
Hornwood
through
the
female
line,
and
the
Glovers
are
fostering
Lord
Harys’s
bastard
at
Deepwood
Motte.
The
Dreadfort
has
no
claim
that
I
know,
but
the
lands
adjoin,
and
Roose
Bolton
is
not
one
to
overlook
such
a
chance.”

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
“In
such
cases,
her
liege
lord
must
find
her
a
suitable
match.”

“Why
can’t
you
marry
her?”
Bran
asked.
“You
said
she
was
comely,
and
Beth
would
have
a
mother.”

The
old
knight
put
a
hand
on
Bran’s
arm.
“A
kindly
thought,
my
prince,
but
I
am
only
a
knight,
and
besides
too
old.
I
might
hold
her
lands
for
a
few
years,
but
as
soon
as
I
died
Lady
Hornwood
would
find
herself
back
in
the
same
mire,
and
Beth’s
prospects
might
be
perilous
as
well.”

“Then
let
Lord
Hornwood’s
bastard
be
the
heir,”
Bran
said,
thinking
of
his
half
brother
Jon.

Ser
Rodrik
said,
“That
would
please
the
Glovers,
and
perhaps
Lord
Hornwood’s
shade
as
well,
but
I
do
not
think
Lady
Hornwood
would
love
us.
The
boy
is
not
of
her
blood.”

“Still,”
said
Maester
Luwin,
“it
must
be
considered.
Lady
Donella
is
past
her
fertile
years,
as
she
said
herself.
If
not
the
bastard,
who?”

“May
I
be
excused?”
Bran
could
hear
the
squires
at
their
swordplay
in
the
yard
below,
the
ring
of
steel
on
steel.

“As
you
will,
my
prince,”
said
Ser
Rodrik.
“You
did
well.”
Bran
flushed
with
pleasure.
Being
a
lord
was
not
so
tedious
as
he
had
feared,
and
since
Lady
Hornwood
had
been
so
much
briefer
than
Lord
Manderly,
he
even
had
a
few
hours
of
daylight
left
to
visit
with
Summer.
He
liked
to
spend
time
with
his
wolf
every
day,
when
Ser
Rodrik
and
the
maester
allowed
it.

No
sooner
had
Hodor
entered
the
godswood
than
Summer
emerged
from
under
an
oak,
almost
as
if
he
had
known
they
were
coming.
Bran
glimpsed
a
lean
black
shape
watching
from
the
undergrowth
as
well.
“Shaggy,”
he
called.
“Here,
Shaggydog.
To
me.”
But
Rickon’s
wolf
vanished
as
swiftly
as
he’d
appeared.

Hodor
knew
Bran’s
favorite
place,
so
he
took
him
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
beneath
the
great
spread
of
the
heart
tree,
where
Lord
Eddard
used
to
kneel
to
pray.
Ripples
were
running
across
the
surface
of
the
water
when
they
arrived,
making
the
reflection
of
the
weirwood
shimmer
and
dance.
There
was
no
wind,
though.
For
an
instant
Bran
was
baffled.

And
then
Osha
exploded
up
out
of
the
pool
with
a
great
splash,
so
sudden
that
even
Summer
leapt
back,
snarling.
Hodor
jumped
away,
wailing
“Hodor,
Hodor”
in
dismay
until
Bran
patted
his
shoulder
to
soothe
his
fears.
“How
can
you
swim
in
there?”
he
asked
Osha.
“Isn’t
it
cold?”

“As
a
babe
I
suckled
on
icicles,
boy.
I
like
the
cold.”
Osha
swam
to
the
rocks
and
rose
dripping.
She
was
naked,
her
skin
bumpy
with
gooseprickles.
Summer
crept
close
and
sniffed
at
her.
“I
wanted
to
touch
the
bottom.”

“I
never
knew
there
was
a
bottom.”

“Might
be
there
isn’t.”
She
grinned.
“What
are
you
staring
at,
boy?
Never
seen
a
woman
before?”

“I
have
so.”
Bran
had
bathed
with
his
sisters
hundreds
of
times
and
he’d
seen
serving
women
in
the
hot
pools
too.
Osha
looked
different,
though,
hard
and
sharp
instead
of
soft
and
curvy.
Her
legs
were
all
sinew,
her
breasts
flat
as
two
empty
purses.
“You’ve
got
a
lot
of
scars.”

“Every
one
hard
earned.”
She
picked
up
her
brown
shift,
shook
some
leaves
off
of
it,
and
pulled
it
down
over
her
head.

“Fighting
giants?”
Osha
claimed
there
were
still
giants
beyond
the
Wall.
One
day
maybe
I’ll
even
see
one…

“Fighting
men.”
She
belted
herself
with
a
length
of
rope.
“Black
crows,
oft
as
not.
Killed
me
one
too,”
she
said,
shaking
out
her
hair.
It
had
grown
since
she’d
come
to
Winterfell,
well
down
past
her
ears.
She
looked
softer
than
the
woman
who
had
once
tried
to
rob
and
kill
him
in
the
wolfswood.
“Heard
some
yattering
in
the
kitchen
today
about
you
and
them
Freys.”

“Who?
What
did
they
say?”

She
gave
him
a
sour
grin.
“That
it’s
a
fool
boy
who
mocks
a
giant,
and
a
mad
world
when
a
cripple
has
to
defend
him.”

“Hodor
never
knew
they
were
mocking
him,”
Bran
said.
“Anyhow
he
never
fights.”
He
remembered
once
when
he
was
little,
going
to
the
market
square
with
his
mother
and
Septa
Mordane.
They
brought
Hodor
to
carry
for
them,
but
he
had
wandered
away,
and
when
they
found
him
some
boys
had
him
backed
into
an
alley,
poking
him
with
sticks.
“Hodor!”
he
kept
shouting,
cringing
and
covering
himself,
but
he
had
never
raised
a
hand
against
his
tormentors.
“Septon
Chayle
says
he
has
a
gentle
spirit.”

“Aye,”
she
said,
“and
hands
strong
enough
to
twist
a
man’s
head
off
his
shoulders,
if
he
takes
a
mind
to.
All
the
same,
he
better
watch
his
back
around
that
Walder.
Him
and
you
both.
The
big
one
they
call
little,
it
comes
to
me
he’s
well
named.
Big
outside,
little
inside,
and
mean
down
to
the
bones.”

“He’d
never
dare
hurt
me.
He’s
scared
of
Summer,
no
matter
what
he
says.”

“Then
might
be
he’s
not
so
stupid
as
he
seems.”
Osha
was
always
wary
around
the
direwolves.
The
day
she
was
taken,
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
between
them
had
torn
three
wildlings
to
bloody
pieces.
“Or
might
be
he
is.
And
that
tastes
of
trouble
too.”
She
tied
up
her
hair.
“You
have
more
of
them
wolf
dreams?”

“No.”
He
did
not
like
to
talk
about
the
dreams.

“A
prince
should
lie
better
than
that.”
Osha
laughed.
“Well,
your
dreams
are
your
business.
Mine’s
in
the
kitchens,
and
I’d
best
be
getting
back
before
Gage
starts
to
shouting
and
waving
that
big
wooden
spoon
of
his.
By
your
leave,
my
prince.”

She
should
never
have
talked
about
the
wolf
dreams,
Bran
thought
as
Hodor
carried
him
up
the
steps
to
his
bedchamber.
He
fought
against
sleep
as
long
as
he
could,
but
in
the
end
it
took
him
as
it
always
did.
On
this
night
he
dreamed
of
the
weirwood.
it
was
looking
at
him
with
its
deep
red
eyes,
calling
to
him
with
its
twisted
wooden
mouth,
and
from
its
pale
branches
the
three-eyed
crow
came
flapping,
pecking
at
his
face
and
crying
his
name
in
a
voice
as
sharp
as
swords.

The
blast
of
horns
woke
him.
Bran
pushed
himself
onto
his
side,
grateful
for
the
reprieve.
He
heard
horses
and
boisterous
shouting.
More
guests
have
come,
and
half-drunk
by
the
noise
of
them.
Grasping
his
bars
he
pulled
himself
from
the
bed
and
over
to
the
window
seat.
On
their
banner
was
a
giant
in
shattered
chains
that
told
him
that
these
were
Umber
men,
down
from
the
northlands
beyond
the
Last
River.

The
next
day
two
of
them
came
together
to
audience;
the
Greatjon’s
uncles,
blustery
men
in
the
winter
of
their
days
with
beards
as
white
as
the
bearskin
cloaks
they
wore.
A
crow
had
once
taken
Mors
for
dead
and
pecked
out
his
eye,
so
he
wore
a
chunk
of
dragonglass
in
its
stead.
As
Old
Nan
told
the
tale,
he’d
grabbed
the
crow
in
his
fist
and
bitten
its
head
off,
so
they
named
him
Crowfood.
She
would
never
tell
Bran
why
his
gaunt
brother
Hother
was
called
Whoresbane.

No
sooner
had
they
been
seated
than
Mors
asked
for
leave
to
wed
Lady
Hornwood.
“The
Greatjon’s
the
Young
Wolf’s
strong
right
hand,
all
know
that
to
be
true.
Who
better
to
protect
the
widow’s
lands
than
an
Umber,
and
what
Umber
better
than
me?”

“Lady
Donella
is
still
grieving,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

“I
have
a
cure
for
grief
under
my
furs.”
Mors
laughed.
Ser
Rodrik
thanked
him
courteously
and
promised
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
lady
and
the
king.

Hother
wanted
ships.
“There’s
wildlings
stealing
down
from
the
north,
more
than
I’ve
ever
seen
before.
They
cross
the
Bay
of
Seals
in
little
boats
and
wash
up
on
our
shores.
The
crows
in
Eastwatch
are
too
few
to
stop
them,
and
they
go
to
ground
quick
as
weasels.
It’s
longships
we
need,
aye,
and
strong
men
to
sail
them.
The
Greatjon
took
too
many.
Half
our
harvest
is
gone
to
seed
for
want
of
arms
to
swing
the
scythes.”

Ser
Rodrik
pulled
at
his
whiskers.
“You
have
forests
of
tall
pine
and
old
oak.
Lord
Manderly
has
shipwrights
and
sailors
in
plenty.
Together
you
ought
to
be
able
to
float
enough
longships
to
guard
both
your
coasts.”

“Manderly?”
Mors
Umber
snorted.
“That
great
waddling
sack
of
suet?
His
own
people
mock
him
as
Lord
Lamprey,
I’ve
heard.
The
man
can
scarce
walk.
If
you
stuck
a
sword
in
his
belly,
ten
thousand
eels
would
wriggle
out.”

“He
is
fat,”
Ser
Rodrik
admitted,
“but
he
is
not
stupid.
You
will
work
with
him,
or
the
king
will
know
the
reason
why.”
And
to
Bran’s
astonishment,
the
truculent
Umbers
agreed
to
do
as
he
commanded,
though
not
without
grumbling.

While
they
were
sitting
at
audience,
the
Glover
men
arrived
from
Deepwood
Motte,
and
a
large
party
of
Tallharts
from
Torrhen’s
Square.
Galbart
and
Robett
Glover
had
left
Deepwood
in
the
hands
of
Robett’s
wife,
but
it
was
their
steward
who
came
to
Winterfell.
“My
lady
begs
that
you
excuse
her
absence.
Her
babes
are
still
too
young
for
such
a
journey,
and
she
was
loath
to
leave
them.”
Bran
soon
realized
that
it
was
the
steward,
not
Lady
Glover,
who
truly
ruled
at
Deepwood
Motte.
The
man
allowed
that
he
was
at
present
setting
aside
only
a
tenth
of
his
harvest.
A
hedge
wizard
had
told
him
there
would
be
a
bountiful
spirit
summer
before
the
cold
set
in,
he
claimed.
Maester
Luwin
had
a
number
of
choice
things
to
say
about
hedge
wizards.
Ser
Rodrik
commanded
the
man
to
set
aside
a
fifth,
and
questioned
the
steward
closely
about
Lord
Hornwood’s
bastard,
the
boy
Larence
Snow.
In
the
north,
all
highborn
bastards
took
the
surname
Snow.
This
lad
was
near
twelve,
and
the
steward
praised
his
wits
and
courage.

“Your
notion
about
the
bastard
may
have
merit,
Bran,”
Maester
Luwin
said
after.
“One
day
you
will
be
a
good
lord
for
Winterfell,
I
think.”

“No
I
won’t.”
Bran
knew
he
would
never
be
a
lord,
no
more
than
he
could
be
a
knight.
“Robb’s
to
marry
some
Frey
girl,
you
told
me
so
yourself,
and
the
Walders
say
the
same.
He’ll
have
sons,
and
they’ll
be
the
lords
of
Winterfell
after
him,
not
me.”

“It
may
be
so,
Bran,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
“but
I
was
wed
three
times
and
my
wives
gave
me
daughters.
Now
only
Beth
remains
to
me.
My
brother
Martyn
fathered
four
strong
sons,
yet
only
Jory
lived
to
be
a
man.
When
he
was
slain,
Martyn’s
line
died
with
him.
When
we
speak
of
the
morrow
nothing
is
ever
certain.”

Leobald
Tallhart
had
his
turn
the
following
day.
He
spoke
of
weather
portents
and
the
slack
wits
of
smallfolk,
and
told
how
his
nephew
itched
for
battle.
“Benfred
has
raised
his
own
company
of
lances.
Boys,
none
older
than
nineteen
years,
but
every
one
thinks
he’s
another
young
wolf.
When
I
told
them
they
were
only
young
rabbits,
they
laughed
at
me.
Now
they
call
themselves
the
Wild
Hares
and
gallop
about
the
country
with
rabbitskins
tied
to
the
ends
of
their
lances,
singing
songs
of
chivalry.”

Bran
thought
that
sounded
grand.
He
remembered
Benfred
Tallhart,
a
big
bluff
loud
boy
who
had
often
visited
Winterfell
with
his
father,
Ser
Helman,
and
had
been
friendly
with
Robb
and
with
Theon
Greyjoy.
But
Ser
Rodrik
was
clearly
displeased
by
what
he
heard.
“If
the
king
were
in
need
of
more
men,
he
would
send
for
them,”
he
said.
“Instruct
your
nephew
that
he
is
to
remain
at
Torrhen’s
Square,
as
his
lord
father
commanded.”

“I
will,
ser,”
said
Leobald,
and
only
then
raised
the
matter
of
Lady
Hornwood.
Poor
thing,
with
no
husband
to
defend
her
lands
nor
son
to
inherit.
His
own
lady
wife
was
a
Hornwood,
sister
to
the
late
Lord
Halys,
doubtless
they
recalled.
“An
empty
hall
is
a
sad
one.
I
had
a
thought
to
send
my
younger
son
to
Lady
Donella
to
foster
as
her
own.
Beren
is
near
ten,
a
likely
lad,
and
her
own
nephew.
He
would
cheer
her,
I
am
certain,
and
perhaps
he
would
even
take
the
name
Hornwood…”

“If
he
were
named
heir?”
suggested
Maester
Luwin.

“…so
the
House
might
continue,”
finished
Leobald.

Bran
knew
what
to
say.
“Thank
you
for
the
notion,
my
lord,”
he
blurted
out
before
Ser
Rodrik
could
speak.
“We
will
bring
the
matter
to
my
brother
Robb.
Oh,
and
Lady
Hornwood.”

Leobald
seemed
surprised
that
he
had
spoken.
“I’m
grateful,
my
prince,”
he
said,
but
Bran
saw
pity
in
his
pale
blue
eyes,
mingled
perhaps
with
a
little
gladness
that
the
cripple
was,
after
all,
not
his
son.
For
a
moment
he
hated
the
man.

Maester
Luwin
liked
him
better,
though.
“Beren
Tallhart
may
well
be
our
best
answer,”
he
told
them
when
Leobald
had
gone.
“By
blood
he
is
half
Hornwood.
If
he
takes
his
uncle’s
name…”

“…he
will
still
be
a
boy,”
said
Ser
Rodrik,
“and
hard-pressed
to
hold
his
lands
against
the
likes
of
Mors
Umber
or
this
bastard
of
Roose
Bolton’s.
We
must
think
on
this
carefully.
Robb
should
have
our
best
counsel
before
he
makes
his
decision.”

“It
may
come
down
to
practicalities,”
said
Maester
Luwin.
“Which
lord
he
most
needs
to
court.
The
riverlands
are
part
of
his
realm,
he
may
wish
to
cement
the
alliance
by
wedding
Lady
Hornwood
to
one
of
the
lords
of
the
Trident.
A
Blackwood,
perhaps,
or
a
Frey—”

“Lady
Hornwood
can
have
one
of
our
Freys,”
said
Bran.
“She
can
have
both
of
them
if
she
likes.”

“You
are
not
kind,
my
prince,”
Ser
Rodrik
chided
gently.

Neither
are
the
Walders.
Scowling,
Bran
stared
down
at
the
table
and
said
nothing.

In
the
days
that
followed,
ravens
arrived
from
other
lordly
houses,
bearing
regrets.
The
bastard
of
the
Dreadfort
would
not
be
joining
them,
the
Mormonts
and
Karstarks
had
all
gone
south
with
Robb,
Lord
Locke
was
too
old
to
dare
the
journey,
Lady
Flint
was
heavy
with
child,
there
was
sickness
at
Widow’s
Watch.
Finally
all
of
the
principal
vassals
of
House
Stark
had
been
heard
from
save
for
Howland
Reed
the
crannogman,
who
had
not
set
foot
outside
his
swamps
for
many
a
year,
and
the
Cerwyns
whose
castle
lay
a
half
day’s
ride
from
Winterfell.
Lord
Cerwyn
was
a
captive
of
the
Lannisters,
but
his
son,
a
lad
of
fourteen,
arrived
one
bright,
blustery
morning
at
the
head
of
two
dozen
lances.
Bran
was
riding
Dancer
around
the
yard
when
they
came
through
the
gate.
He
trotted
over
to
greet
them.
Cley
Cerwyn
had
always
been
a
friend
to
Bran
and
his
brothers.

“Good
morrow,
Bran,”
Cley
called
out
cheerfully.
“Or
must
I
call
you
Prince
Bran
now?”

“Only
if
you
want.”

Cley
laughed.
“Why
not?
Everyone
else
is
a
king
or
prince
these
days.
Did
Stannis
write
Winterfell
as
well?”

“Stannis?
I
don’t
know.”

“He’s
a
king
now
too,”
Cley
confided.
“He
says
Queen
Cersei
bedded
her
brother,
so
Joffrey
is
a
bastard.”

“Joffrey
the
Illborn,”
one
of
the
Cerwyn
knights
growled.
“Small
wonder
he’s
faithless,
with
the
Kingslayer
for
a
father.”

“Aye,”
said
another,
“the
gods
hate
incest.
Look
how
they
brought
down
the
Targaryens.”

For
a
moment
Bran
felt
as
though
he
could
not
breathe.
A
giant
hand
was
crushing
his
chest.
He
felt
as
though
he
was
falling,
and
clutched
desperately
at
Dancer’s
reins.

His
terror
must
have
shown
on
his
face.
“Bran?”
Cley
Cerwyn
said.
“Are
you
unwell?
It’s
only
another
king.”

“Robb
will
beat
him
too.”
He
turned
Dancer’s
head
toward
the
stables,
oblivious
to
the
puzzled
stares
the
Cerwyns
gave
him.
His
blood
was
roaring
in
his
ears,
and
had
he
not
been
strapped
onto
his
saddle
he
might
well
have
fallen.

That
night
Bran
prayed
to
his
father’s
gods
for
dreamless
sleep.
If
the
gods
heard,
they
mocked
his
hopes,
for
the
nightmare
they
sent
was
worse
than
any
wolf
dream.

“Fly
or
die!”
cried
the
three-eyed
crow
as
it
pecked
at
him.
He
wept
and
pleaded
but
the
crow
had
no
pity.
It
put
out
his
left
eye
and
then
his
right,
and
when
he
was
blind
in
the
dark
it
pecked
at
his
brow,
driving
its
terrible
sharp
beak
deep
into
his
skull.
He
screamed
until
he
was
certain
his
lungs
must
burst.
The
pain
was
an
axe
splitting
his
head
apart,
but
when
the
crow
wrenched
out
its
beak
all
slimy
with
bits
of
bone
and
brain,
Bran
could
see
again.
What
he
saw
made
him
gasp
in
fear.
He
was
clinging
to
a
tower
miles
high,
and
his
fingers
were
slipping,
nails
scrabbling
at
the
stone,
his
legs
dragging
him
down,
stupid
useless
dead
legs.
“Help
me!”
he
cried.
A
golden
man
appeared
in
the
sky
above
him
and
pulled
him
up.
“The
things
I
do
for
love,”
he
murmured
softly
as
he
tossed
him
out
kicking
into
empty
air.





TYRION

“I
do
not
sleep
as
I
did
when
I
was
younger,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
told
him,
by
way
of
apology
for
the
dawn
meeting.
“I
would
sooner
be
up,
though
the
world
be
dark,
than
lie
restless
abed,
fretting
on
tasks
undone,”
he
said—though
his
heavy-lidded
eyes
made
him
look
half-asleep
as
he
said
it.

In
the
airy
chambers
beneath
the
rookery,
his
girl
served
them
boiled
eggs,
stewed
plums,
and
porridge,
while
Pycelle
served
the
pontifications.
“In
these
sad
times,
when
so
many
hunger,
I
think
it
only
fitting
to
keep
my
table
spare.”

“Commendable,”
Tyrion
admitted,
breaking
a
large
brown
egg
that
reminded
him
unduly
of
the
Grand
Maester’s
bald
spotted
head.
“I
take
a
different
view.
If
there
is
food
I
eat
it,
in
case
there
is
none
on
the
morrow.”
He
smiled.
“Tell
me,
are
your
ravens
early
risers
as
well?”

Pycelle
stroked
the
snowy
beard
that
flowed
down
his
chest.
“To
be
sure.
Shall
I
send
for
quill
and
ink
after
we
have
eaten?”

“No
need.”
Tyrion
laid
the
letters
on
the
table
beside
his
porridge,
twin
parchments
tightly
rolled
and
sealed
with
wax
at
both
ends.
“Send
your
girl
away,
so
we
can
talk.”

“Leave
us,
child,”
Pycelle
commanded.
The
serving
girl
hurried
from
the
room.
“These
letters,
now…”

“For
the
eyes
of
Doran
Martell,
Prince
of
Dorne.”
Tyrion
peeled
the
cracked
shell
away
from
his
egg
and
took
a
bite.
It
wanted
salt.
“One
letter,
in
two
copies.
Send
your
swiftest
birds.
The
matter
is
of
great
import.”

“I
shall
dispatch
them
as
soon
as
we
have
broken
our
fast.”

“Dispatch
them
now.
Stewed
plums
will
keep.
The
realm
may
not.
Lord
Renly
is
leading
his
host
up
the
roseroad,
and
no
one
can
say
when
Lord
Stannis
will
sail
from
Dragonstone.”

Pycelle
blinked.
“If
my
lord
prefers—”

“He
does.”

“I
am
here
to
serve.”
The
maester
pushed
himself
ponderously
to
his
feet
his
chain
of
office
clinking
softly.
It
was
a
heavy
thing,
a
dozen
maester’s
collars
threaded
around
and
through
each
other
and
ornamented
with
gemstones.
And
it
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
the
gold
and
silver
and
platinum
links
far
outnumbered
those
of
baser
metals.

Pycelle
moved
so
slowly
that
Tyrion
had
time
to
finish
his
egg
and
taste
the
plums—overcooked
and
watery,
to
his
taste—before
the
sound
of
wings
prompted
him
to
rise.
He
spied
the
raven,
dark
in
the
dawn
sky,
and
turned
briskly
toward
the
maze
of
shelves
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.

The
maester’s
medicines
made
an
impressive
display;
dozens
of
pots
sealed
with
wax,
hundreds
of
stoppered
vials,
as
many
milkglass
bottles,
countless
jars
of
dried
herbs,
each
container
neatly
labeled
in
Pycelle’s
precise
hand.
An
orderly
mind,
Tyrion
reflected,
and
indeed,
once
you
puzzled
out
the
arrangement,
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
potion
had
its
place.
And
such
interesting
things.
He
noted
sweetsleep
and
nightshade,
milk
of
the
poppy,
the
tears
of
Lys,
powdered
greycap,
wolfsbane
and
demon’s
dance,
basilisk
venom,
blindeye,
widow’s
blood…

Standing
on
his
toes
and
straining
upward,
he
managed
to
pull
a
small
dusty
bottle
off
the
high
shelf.
When
he
read
the
label,
he
smiled
and
slipped
it
up
his
sleeve.

He
was
back
at
the
table
peeling
another
egg
when
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
creeping
down
the
stairs.
“It
is
done,
my
lord.”
The
old
man
seated
himself.
“A
matter
like
this…
best
done
promptly,
indeed,
indeed…
of
great
import,
you
say?”

“Oh,
yes.”
The
porridge
was
too
thick,
Tyrion
felt,
and
wanted
butter
and
honey.
To
be
sure,
butter
and
honey
were
seldom
seen
in
King’s
Landing
of
late,
though
Lord
Gyles
kept
them
well
supplied
in
the
castle.
Half
of
the
food
they
ate
these
days
came
from
his
lands
or
Lady
Tanda’s.
Rosby
and
Stokeworth
lay
near
the
city
to
the
north,
and
were
yet
untouched
by
war.

“The
Prince
of
Dorne,
himself.
Might
I
ask…”

“Best
not.”

“As
you
say.”
Pycelle’s
curiosity
was
so
ripe
that
Tyrion
could
almost
taste
it.
“Mayhaps…
the
king’s
council…”

Tyrion
tapped
his
wooden
spoon
against
the
edge
of
the
bowl.
“The
council
exists
to
advise
the
king,
Maester.”

“Just
so,”
said
Pycelle,
“and
the
king—”

“—is
a
boy
of
thirteen.
I
speak
with
his
voice.”

“So
you
do.
Indeed.
The
King’s
Own
Hand.
Yet…
your
most
gracious
sister,
our
Queen
Regent,
she…”

“…bears
a
great
weight
upon
those
lovely
white
shoulders
of
hers.
I
have
no
wish
to
add
to
her
burdens.
Do
you?”
Tyrion
cocked
his
head
and
gave
the
Grand
Maester
an
inquiring
stare.

Pycelle
dropped
his
gaze
back
to
his
food.
Something
about
Tyrion’s
mismatched
green-and-black
eyes
made
men
squirm;
knowing
that,
he
made
good
use
of
them.
“Ah,”
the
old
man
muttered
into
his
plums.
“Doubtless
you
have
the
right
of
it,
my
lord.
It
is
most
considerate
of
you
to…
spare
her
this…
burden.”

“That’s
just
the
sort
of
fellow
I
am.”
Tyrion
returned
to
the
unsatisfactory
porridge.
“Considerate.
Cersei
is
my
own
sweet
sister,
after
all.”

“And
a
woman,
to
be
sure,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“A
most
uncommon
woman,
and
yet…
it
is
no
small
thing,
to
tend
to
all
the
cares
of
the
realm,
despite
the
frailty
of
her
sex…”

Oh,
yes,
she’s
a
frail
dove,
just
ask
Eddard
Stark.
“I’m
pleased
you
share
my
concern.
And
I
thank
you
for
the
hospitality
of
your
table.
But
a
long
day
awaits.”
He
swung
his
legs
out
and
clambered
down
from
his
chair.
“Be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
at
once
should
we
receive
a
reply
from
Dorne?
“

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”

“And
only
me?”

“Ah…
to
be
sure.”
Pycelle’s
spotted
hand
was
clutching
at
his
beard
the
way
a
drowning
man
clutches
for
a
rope.
It
made
Tyrion’s
heart
glad.
One,
he
thought.

He
waddled
out
into
the
lower
bailey;
his
stunted
legs
complained
of
the
steps.
The
sun
was
well
up
now,
and
the
castle
was
stirring.
Guardsmen
walked
the
walls,
and
knights
and
men-at-arms
were
training
with
blunted
weapons.
Nearby,
Bronn
sat
on
the
lip
of
a
well.
A
pair
of
comely
serving
girls
sauntered
past
carrying
a
wicker
basket
of
rushes
between
them,
but
the
sellsword
never
looked.
“Bronn,
I
despair
of
you.”
Tyrion
gestured
at
the
wenches.
“With
sweet
sights
like
that
before
you,
all
you
see
is
a
gaggle
of
louts
raising
a
clangor.”

“There
are
a
hundred
whorehouses
in
this
city
where
a
clipped
copper
will
buy
me
all
the
cunt
I
want,”
Bronn
answered,
“but
one
day
my
life
may
hang
on
how
close
I’ve
watched
your
louts.”
He
stood.
“Who’s
the
boy
in
the
checkered
blue
surcoat
with
the
three
eyes
on
his
shield?”

“Some
hedge
knight.
Tallad,
he
names
himself.
Why?”

Bronn
pushed
a
fall
of
hair
from
his
eyes.
“He’s
the
best
of
them.
But
watch
him,
he
falls
into
a
rhythm,
delivering
the
same
strokes
in
the
same
order
each
time
he
attacks.”
He
grinned.
“That
will
be
the
death
of
him,
the
day
he
faces
me.”

“He’s
pledged
to
Joffrey;
he’s
not
like
to
face
you.”
They
set
off
across
the
bailey,
Bronn
matching
his
long
stride
to
Tyrion’s
short
one.
These
days
the
sellsword
was
looking
almost
respectable.
His
dark
hair
was
washed
and
brushed,
he
was
freshly
shaved,
and
he
wore
the
black
breastplate
of
an
officer
of
the
City
Watch.
From
his
shoulders
trailed
a
cloak
of
Lannister
crimson
patterned
with
golden
hands.
Tyrion
had
made
him
a
gift
of
it
when
he
named
him
captain
of
his
personal
guard.
“How
many
supplicants
do
we
have
today?”
he
inquired.

“Thirty
odd,”
answered
Bronn.
“Most
with
complaints,
or
wanting
something,
as
ever.
Your
pet
was
back.”

He
groaned.
“Lady
Tanda?”

“Her
page.
She
invites
you
to
sup
with
her
again.
There’s
to
be
a
haunch
of
venison,
she
says,
a
brace
of
stuffed
geese
sauced
with
mulberries,
and—”

“—her
daughter,”
Tyrion
finished
sourly.
Since
the
hour
he
had
arrived
in
the
Red
Keep,
Lady
Tanda
had
been
stalking
him,
armed
with
a
never-ending
arsenal
of
lamprey
pies,
wild
boars,
and
savory
cream
stews.
Somehow
she
had
gotten
the
notion
that
a
dwarf
lordling
would
be
the
perfect
consort
for
her
daughter
Lollys,
a
large,
soft,
dim-witted
girl
who
rumor
said
was
still
a
maid
at
thirty-and-three.
“Send
her
my
regrets.”

“No
taste
for
stuffed
goose?”
Bronn
grinned
evilly.

“Perhaps
you
should
eat
the
goose
and
marry
the
maid.
Or
better
still,
send
Shagga.”

“Shagga’s
more
like
to
eat
the
maid
and
marry
the
goose,”
observed
Bronn.
“Anyway,
Lollys
outweighs
him.”

“There
is
that,”
Tyrion
admitted
as
they
passed
under
the
shadow
of
a
covered
walkway
between
two
towers.
“Who
else
wants
me?”

The
sellsword
grew
more
serious.
“There’s
a
moneylender
from
Braavos,
holding
fancy
papers
and
the
like,
requests
to
see
the
king
about
payment
on
some
loan.”

“As
if
Joff
could
count
past
twenty.
Send
the
man
to
Littlefinger,
he’ll
find
a
way
to
put
him
off.
Next?”

“A
lordling
down
from
the
Trident,
says
your
father’s
men
burned
his
keep,
raped
his
wife,
and
killed
all
his
peasants.”

“I
believe
they
call
that
war.”
Tyrion
smelled
Gregor
Clegane’s
work,
or
that
of
Ser
Amory
Lorch
or
his
father’s
other
pet
hellhound,
the
Qohorik.
“What
does
he
want
of
Joffrey?”

“New
peasants,”
Bronn
said.
“He
walked
all
this
way
to
sing
how
loyal
he
is
and
beg
for
recompense.”

“I’ll
make
time
for
him
on
the
morrow.”
Whether
truly
loyal
or
merely
desperate,
a
compliant
river
lord
might
have
his
uses.
“See
that
he’s
given
a
comfortable
chamber
and
a
hot
meal.
Send
him
a
new
pair
of
boots
as
well,
good
ones,
courtesy
of
King
Joffrey.”
A
show
of
generosity
never
hurt.

Bronn
gave
a
curt
nod.
“There’s
also
a
great
gaggle
of
bakers,
butchers,
and
greengrocers
clamoring
to
be
heard.”

“I
told
them
last
time,
I
have
nothing
to
give
them.”
Only
a
thin
trickle
of
food
was
coming
into
King’s
Landing,
most
of
it
earmarked
for
castle
and
garrison.
Prices
had
risen
sickeningly
high
on
greens,
roots,
flour,
and
fruit,
and
Tyrion
did
not
want
to
think
about
what
sorts
of
flesh
might
be
going
into
the
kettles
of
the
pot-shops
down
in
Flea
Bottom.
Fish,
he
hoped.
They
still
had
the
river
and
the
sea…
at
least
until
Lord
Stannis
sailed.

“They
want
protection.
Last
night
a
baker
was
roasted
in
his
own
oven.
The
mob
claimed
he
charged
too
much
for
bread.”

“Did
he?”

“He’s
not
apt
to
deny
it.”

“They
didn’t
eat
him,
did
they?”

“Not
that
I’ve
heard.”

“Next
time
they
will,”
Tyrion
said
grimly.
“I
give
them
what
protection
I
can.
The
gold
cloaks—”

“They
claim
there
were
gold
cloaks
in
the
mob,”
Bronn
said.
“They’re
demanding
to
speak
to
the
king
himself.”

“Fools.”
Tyrion
had
sent
them
off
with
regrets;
his
nephew
would
send
them
off
with
whips
and
spears.
He
was
half-tempted
to
allow
it…
but
no,
he
dare
not.
Soon
or
late,
some
enemy
would
march
on
King’s
Landing,
and
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
willing
traitors
within
the
city
walls.
“Tell
them
King
Joffrey
shares
their
fears
and
will
do
all
he
can
for
them.”

“They
want
bread,
not
promises.”

“If
I
give
them
bread
today,
on
the
morrow
I’ll
have
twice
as
many
at
the
gates.
Who
else?”

“A
black
brother
down
from
the
Wall.
The
steward
says
he
brought
some
rotted
hand
in
a
jar.”

Tyrion
smiled
wanly.
“I’m
surprised
no
one
ate
it.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
see
him.
It’s
not
Yoren,
perchance?”

“No.
Some
knight.
Thorne.”

“Ser
Alliser
Thorne?”
Of
all
the
black
brothers
he’d
met
on
the
Wall,
Tyrion
Lannister
had
liked
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
the
least.
A
bitter,
mean-spirited
man
with
too
great
a
sense
of
his
own
worth.
“Come
to
think
on
it,
I
don’t
believe
I
care
to
see
Ser
Alliser
just
now.
Find
him
a
snug
cell
where
no
one
has
changed
the
rushes
in
a
year,
and
let
his
hand
rot
a
little
more.”

Bronn
snorted
laughter
and
went
his
way,
while
Tyrion
struggled
up
the
serpentine
steps.
As
he
limped
across
the
outer
yard,
he
heard
the
portcullis
rattling
up.
His
sister
and
a
large
party
were
waiting
by
the
main
gate.

Mounted
on
her
white
palfrey,
Cersei
towered
high
above
him,
a
goddess
in
green.
“Brother,”
she
called
out,
not
warmly.
The
queen
had
not
been
pleased
by
the
way
he’d
dealt
with
Janos
Slynt.

“Your
Grace.”
Tyrion
bowed
politely.
“You
look
lovely
this
morning.”
Her
crown
was
gold,
her
cloak
ermine.
Her
retinue
sat
their
mounts
behind
her:
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard,
wearing
white
scale
and
his
favorite
scowl;
Ser
Balon
Swann,
bow
slung
from
his
silver-inlay
saddle;
Lord
Gyles
Rosby,
his
wheezing
cough
worse
than
ever;
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
of
the
Alchemists’
Guild;
and
the
queen’s
newest
favorite,
their
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister,
her
late
husband’s
squire
upjumped
to
knight
at
his
widow’s
insistence.
Vylarr
and
twenty
guardsmen
rode
escort.
“Where
are
you
bound
this
day,
sister?”
Tyrion
asked.

“I’m
making
a
round
of
the
gates
to
inspect
the
new
scorpions
and
spitfires.
I
would
not
have
it
thought
that
all
of
us
are
as
indifferent
to
the
city’s
defense
as
you
seem
to
be.”
Cersei
fixed
him
with
those
clear
green
eyes
of
hers,
beautiful
even
in
their
contempt.
“I
am
informed
that
Renly
Baratheon
has
marched
from
Highgarden.
He
is
making
his
way
up
the
roseroad,
with
all
his
strength
behind
him.”

“Varys
gave
me
the
same
report.”

“He
could
be
here
by
the
full
moon.”

“Not
at
his
present
leisurely
pace,”
Tyrion
assured
her.
“He
feasts
every
night
in
a
different
castle,
and
holds
court
at
every
crossroads
he
passes.”

“And
every
day,
more
men
rally
to
his
banners.
His
host
is
now
said
to
be
a
hundred
thousand
strong.”

“That
seems
rather
high.”

“He
has
the
power
of
Storm’s
End
and
Highgarden
behind
him,
you
little
fool,”
Cersei
snapped
down
at
him.
“All
the
Tyrell
bannermen
but
for
the
Redwynes,
and
you
have
me
to
thank
for
that.
So
long
as
I
hold
those
poxy
twins
of
his,
Lord
Paxter
will
squat
on
the
Arbor
and
count
himself
fortunate
to
be
out
of
it.”

“A
pity
you
let
the
Knight
of
Flowers
slip
through
your
pretty
fingers.
Still,
Renly
has
other
concerns
besides
us.
Our
father
at
Harrenhal,
Robb
Stark
at
Riverrun…
were
I
he,
I
would
do
much
as
he
is
doing.
Make
my
progress,
flaunt
my
power
for
the
realm
to
see,
watch,
wait.
Let
my
rivals
contend
while
I
bide
my
own
sweet
time.
If
Stark
defeats
us,
the
south
will
fall
into
Renly’s
hands
like
a
windfall
from
the
gods,
and
he’ll
not
have
lost
a
man.
And
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
he
can
descend
on
us
while
we
are
weakened.”

Cersei
was
not
appeased.
“I
want
you
to
make
Father
bring
his
army
to
King’s
Landing.”

Where
it
will
serve
no
purpose
but
to
make
you
feel
safe.
“When
have
I
ever
been
able
to
make
Father
do
anything?”

She
ignored
the
question.
“And
when
do
you
plan
to
free
Jaime?
He’s
worth
a
hundred
of
you.”

Tyrion
grinned
crookedly.
“Don’t
tell
Lady
Stark,
I
beg
you.
We
don’t
have
a
hundred
of
me
to
trade.”

“Father
must
have
been
mad
to
send
you.
You’re
worse
than
useless.”
The
queen
jerked
on
her
reins
and
wheeled
her
palfrey
around.
She
rode
out
the
gate
at
a
brisk
trot,
ermine
cloak
streaming
behind
her.
Her
retinue
hastened
after.

In
truth,
Renly
Baratheon
did
not
frighten
Tyrion
half
so
much
as
his
brother
Stannis
did.
Renly
was
beloved
of
the
commons,
but
he
had
never
before
led
men
in
war.
Stannis
was
otherwise:
hard,
cold,
inexorable.
if
only
they
had
some
way
of
knowing
what
was
happening
on
Dragonstone…
but
not
one
of
the
fisherfolk
he
had
paid
to
spy
out
the
island
had
ever
returned,
and
even
the
informers
the
eunuch
claimed
to
have
placed
in
Stannis’s
household
had
been
ominously
silent.
The
striped
hulls
of
Lysene
war
galleys
had
been
seen
offshore,
though,
and
Varys
had
reports
from
Myr
of
sellsail
captains
taking
service
with
Dragonstone.
If
Stannis
attacks
by
sea
while
his
brother
Renly
storms
the
gates,
they’ll
soon
be
mounting
Joffrey’s
head
on
a
spike.
Worse,
mine
will
be
beside
him.
A
depressing
thought.
He
ought
to
make
plans
to
get
Shae
safely
out
of
the
city,
should
the
worst
seem
likely.

Podrick
Payne
stood
at
the
door
of
his
solar,
studying
the
floor.
“He’s
inside,”
he
announced
to
Tyrion’s
belt
buckle.
“Your
solar.
My
lord.
Sorry.”

Tyrion
sighed.
“Look
at
me,
Pod.
It
unnerves
me
when
you
talk
to
my
codpiece,
especially
when
I’m
not
wearing
one.
Who
is
inside
my
solar?”

“Lord
Littlefinger.”
Podrick
managed
a
quick
look
at
his
face,
then
hastily
dropped
his
eyes.
“I
meant,
Lord
Petyr.
Lord
Baelish.
The
master
of
coin.
“

“You
make
him
sound
a
crowd.”
The
boy
hunched
down
as
if
struck,
making
Tyrion
feel
absurdly
guilty.

Lord
Petyr
was
seated
on
his
window
seat,
languid
and
elegant
in
a
plush
plum-colored
doublet
and
a
yellow
satin
cape,
one
gloved
hand
resting
on
his
knee.
“The
king
is
fighting
hares
with
a
crossbow,”
he
said.
“The
hares
are
winning.
Come
see.”

Tyrion
had
to
stand
on
his
toes
to
get
a
look.
A
dead
hare
lay
on
the
ground
below;
another,
long
ears
twitching,
was
about
to
expire
from
the
bolt
in
his
side.
Spent
quarrels
lay
strewn
across
the
hard-packed
earth
like
straws
scattered
by
a
storm.
“Now!”
Joff
shouted.
The
gamesman
released
the
hare
he
was
holding,
and
he
went
bounding
off.
Joffrey
jerked
the
trigger
on
the
crossbow.
The
bolt
missed
by
two
feet.
The
hare
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
twitched
his
nose
at
the
king.
Cursing,
Joff
spun
the
wheel
to
winch
back
his
string,
but
the
animal
was
gone
before
he
was
loaded.
“Another!”
The
gamesman
reached
into
the
hutch.
This
one
made
a
brown
streak
against
the
stones,
while
Joffrey’s
hurried
shot
almost
took
Ser
Preston
in
the
groin.

Littlefinger
turned
away.
“Boy,
are
you
fond
of
potted
hare?”
he
asked
Podrick
Payne.

Pod
stared
at
the
visitor’s
boots,
lovely
things
of
red-dyed
leather
ornamented
with
black
scrollwork.
“To
eat,
my
lord?”

“Invest
in
pots,”
Littlefinger
advised.
“Hares
will
soon
overrun
the
castle.
We’ll
be
eating
hare
thrice
a
day.”

“Better
than
rats
on
a
skewer,”
said
Tyrion.
“Pod,
leave
us.
Unless
Lord
Petyr
would
care
for
some
refreshment?”

“Thank
you,
but
no.”
Littlefinger
flashed
his
mocking
smile.
“Drink
with
the
dwarf,
it’s
said,
and
you
wake
up
walking
the
Wall.
Black
brings
out
my
unhealthy
pallor.”

Have
no
fear,
my
lord,
Tyrion
thought,
it’s
not
the
Wall
I
have
in
mind
for
you.
He
seated
himself
in
a
high
chair
piled
with
cushions
and
said,
“You
look
very
elegant
today,
my
lord.”

“I’m
wounded.
I
strive
to
look
elegant
every
day.”

“Is
the
doublet
new?”

“It
is.
You’re
most
observant.”

“Plum
and
yellow.
Are
those
the
colors
of
your
House?”

“No.
But
a
man
gets
bored
wearing
the
same
colors
day
in
and
day
out,
or
so
I’ve
found.”

“That’s
a
handsome
knife
as
well.”

“Is
it?”
There
was
mischief
in
Littlefinger’s
eyes.
He
drew
the
knife
and
glanced
at
it
casually,
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before.
“Valyrian
steel,
and
a
dragonbone
hilt.
A
trifle
plain,
though.
It’s
yours,
if
you
would
like
it.”

“Mine?”
Tyrion
gave
him
a
long
look.
“No.
I
think
not.
Never
mine.”
He
knows,
the
insolent
wretch.
He
knows
and
he
knows
that
I
know,
and
he
thinks
that
I
cannot
touch
him.

If
ever
truly
a
man
had
armored
himself
in
gold,
it
was
Petyr
Baelish,
not
Jaime
Lannister.
Jaime’s
famous
armor
was
but
gilded
steel,
but
Littlefinger,
ah…
Tyrion
had
learned
a
few
things
about
sweet
Petyr,
to
his
growing
disquiet.

Ten
years
ago,
Jon
Arryn
had
given
him
a
minor
sinecure
in
customs,
where
Lord
Petyr
had
soon
distinguished
himself
by
bringing
in
three
times
as
much
as
any
of
the
king’s
other
collectors.
King
Robert
had
been
a
prodigious
spender.
A
man
like
Petyr
Baelish,
who
had
a
gift
for
rubbing
two
golden
dragons
together
to
breed
a
third,
was
invaluable
to
his
Hand.
Littlefinger’s
rise
had
been
arrow-swift.
Within
three
years
of
his
coming
to
court,
he
was
master
of
coin
and
a
member
of
the
small
council,
and
today
the
crown’s
revenues
were
ten
times
what
they
had
been
under
his
beleaguered
predecessor…
though
the
crown’s
debts
had
grown
vast
as
well.
A
master
juggler
was
Petyr
Baelish.

Oh,
he
was
clever.
He
did
not
simply
collect
the
gold
and
lock
it
in
a
treasure
vault,
no.
He
paid
the
king’s
debts
in
promises,
and
put
the
king’s
gold
to
work.
He
bought
wagons,
shops,
ships,
houses.
He
bought
grain
when
it
was
plentiful
and
sold
bread
when
it
was
scarce.
He
bought
wool
from
the
north
and
linen
from
the
south
and
lace
from
Lys,
stored
it,
moved
it,
dyed
it,
sold
it.
The
golden
dragons
bred
and
multiplied,
and
Littlefinger
lent
them
out
and
brought
them
home
with
hatchlings.

And
in
the
process,
he
moved
his
own
men
into
place.
The
Keepers
of
the
Keys
were
his,
all
four.
The
King’s
Counter
and
the
King’s
Scales
were
men
he’d
named.
The
officers
in
charge
of
all
three
mints.
Harbormasters,
tax
farmers,
customs
sergeants,
wool
factors,
toll
collectors,
pursers,
wine
factors;
nine
of
every
ten
belonged
to
Littlefinger.
They
were
men
of
middling
birth,
by
and
large;
merchants’
sons,
lesser
lordlings,
sometimes
even
foreigners,
but
judging
from
their
results,
far
more
able
than
their
highborn
predecessors.

No
one
had
ever
thought
to
question
the
appointments,
and
why
should
they?
Littlefinger
was
no
threat
to
anyone.
A
clever,
smiling,
genial
man,
everyone’s
friend,
always
able
to
find
whatever
gold
the
king
or
his
Hand
required,
and
yet
of
such
undistinguished
birth,
one
step
up
from
a
hedge
knight,
he
was
not
a
man
to
fear.
He
had
no
banners
to
call,
no
army
of
retainers,
no
great
stronghold,
no
holdings
to
speak
of,
no
prospects
of
a
great
marriage.

But
do
I
dare
touch
him?
Tyrion
wondered.
Even
if
he
is
a
traitor?
He
was
not
at
all
certain
he
could,
least
of
all
now,
while
the
war
raged.
Given
time,
he
could
replace
Littlefinger’s
men
with
his
own
in
key
positions,
but…

A
shout
rang
up
from
the
yard.
“Ah,
His
Grace
has
killed
a
hare,”
Lord
Baelish
observed.

“No
doubt
a
slow
one,”
Tyrion
said.
“My
lord,
you
were
fostered
at
Riverrun.
I’ve
heard
it
said
that
you
grew
close
to
the
Tullys.”

“You
might
say
so.
The
girls
especially.”

“How
close?”

“I
had
their
maidenhoods.
Is
that
close
enough?”

The
lie—Tyrion
was
fairly
certain
it
was
a
lie—was
delivered
with
such
an
air
of
nonchalance
that
one
could
almost
believe
it.
Could
it
have
been
Catelyn
Stark
who
lied?
About
her
defloration,
and
the
dagger
as
well?
The
longer
he
lived,
the
more
Tyrion
realized
that
nothing
was
simple
and
little
was
true.
“Lord
Hoster’s
daughters
do
not
love
me,”
he
confessed.
“I
doubt
they
would
listen
to
any
proposal
I
might
make.
Yet
coming
from
you,
the
same
words
might
fall
more
sweetly
on
their
ears.
“

“That
would
depend
on
the
words.
If
you
mean
to
offer
Sansa
in
return
for
your
brother,
waste
someone
else’s
time.
Joffrey
will
never
surrender
his
plaything,
and
Lady
Catelyn
is
not
so
great
a
fool
as
to
barter
the
Kingslayer
for
a
slip
of
a
girl.”

“I
mean
to
have
Arya
as
well.
I
have
men
searching.”

“Searching
is
not
finding.”

“I’ll
keep
that
in
mind,
my
lord.
In
any
case,
it
was
Lady
Lysa
I
hoped
you
might
sway.
For
her,
I
have
a
sweeter
offer.”

“Lysa
is
more
tractable
than
Catelyn,
true…
but
also
more
fearful,
and
I
understand
she
hates
you.”

“She
believes
she
has
good
reason.
When
I
was
her
guest
in
the
Eyrie,
she
insisted
that
Id
murdered
her
husband
and
was
not
inclined
to
listen
to
denials.”
He
leaned
forward.
“If
I
gave
her
Jon
Arryn’s
true
killer,
she
might
think
more
kindly
of
me.”

That
made
Littlefinger
sit
up.
“True
killer?
I
confess,
you
make
me
curious.
Who
do
you
propose?”

It
was
Tyrion’s
turn
to
smile.
“Gifts
I
give
my
friends,
freely.
Lysa
Arryn
would
need
to
understand
that.”

“Is
it
her
friendship
you
require,
or
her
swords?”

“Both.”

Littlefinger
stroked
the
neat
spike
of
his
beard.
“Lysa
has
woes
of
her
own.
Clansmen
raiding
out
of
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
in
greater
numbers
than
ever
before…
and
better
armed.”

“Distressing,”
said
Tyrion
Lannister,
who
had
armed
them.
“I
could
help
her
with
that.
A
word
from
me…”

“And
what
would
this
word
cost
her?”

“I
want
Lady
Lysa
and
her
son
to
acclaim
Joffrey
as
king,
to
swear
fealty,
and
to—”

“—make
war
on
the
Starks
and
Tullys?”
Littlefinger
shook
his
head.
“There’s
the
roach
in
your
pudding,
Lannister.
Lysa
will
never
send
her
knights
against
Riverrun.”

“Nor
would
I
ask
it.
We
have
no
lack
of
enemies.
I’ll
use
her
power
to
oppose
Lord
Renly,
or
Lord
Stannis,
should
he
stir
from
Dragonstone.
In
return,
I
will
give
her
justice
for
Jon
Arryn
and
peace
in
the
Vale.
I
will
even
name
that
appalling
child
of
hers
Warden
of
the
East,
as
his
father
was
before
him.”
I
want
to
see
him
fly,
a
boy’s
voice
whispered
faintly
in
memory.
“And
to
seal
the
bargain,
I
will
give
her
my
niece.”

He
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
look
of
genuine
surprise
in
Petyr
Baelish’s
grey-green
eyes.
“Myrcella?”

“When
she
comes
of
age,
she
can
wed
little
Lord
Robert.
Until
such
time,
she’ll
be
Lady
Lysa’s
ward
at
the
Eyrie.”

“And
what
does
Her
Grace
the
queen
think
of
this
ploy?”
When
Tyrion
shrugged,
Littlefinger
burst
into
laughter.
“I
thought
not.
You’re
a
dangerous
little
man,
Lannister.
Yes,
I
could
sing
this
song
to
Lysa.”
Again
the
sly
smile,
the
mischief
in
his
glance.
“If
I
cared
to.”

Tyrion
nodded,
waiting,
knowing
Littlefinger
could
never
abide
a
long
silence.

“So,”
Lord
Petyr
continued
after
a
pause,
utterly
unabashed,
“what’s
in
your
pot
for
me?”

“Harrenhal.”

It
was
interesting
to
watch
his
face.
Lord
Petyr’s
father
had
been
the
smallest
of
small
lords,
his
grandfather
a
landless
hedge
knight;
by
birth,
he
held
no
more
than
a
few
stony
acres
on
the
windswept
shore
of
the
Fingers.
Harrenhal
was
one
of
the
richest
plums
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
its
lands
broad
and
rich
and
fertile,
its
great
castle
as
formidable
as
any
in
the
realm…
and
so
large
as
to
dwarf
Riverrun,
where
Petyr
Baelish
had
been
fostered
by
House
Tully,
only
to
be
brusquely
expelled
when
he
dared
raise
his
sights
to
Lord
Hoster’s
daughter.

Littlefinger
took
a
moment
to
adjust
the
drape
of
his
cape,
but
Tyrion
had
seen
the
flash
of
hunger
in
those
sly
cat’s
eyes.
I
have
him,
he
knew.
“Harrenhal
is
cursed,”
Lord
Petyr
said
after
a
moment,
trying
to
sound
bored.

“Then
raze
it
to
the
ground
and
build
anew
to
suit
yourself.
You’ll
have
no
lack
of
coin.
I
mean
to
make
you
liege
lord
of
the
Trident.
These
river
lords
have
proven
they
cannot
be
trusted.
Let
them
do
you
fealty
for
their
lands.”

“Even
the
Tullys?”

“If
there
are
any
Tullys
left
when
we
are
done.”

Littlefinger
looked
like
a
boy
who
had
just
taken
a
furtive
bite
from
a
honeycomb.
He
was
trying
to
watch
for
bees,
but
the
honey
was
so
sweet.
“Harrenhal
and
all
its
lands
and
incomes,”
he
mused.
“With
a
stroke,
you’d
make
me
one
of
the
greatest
lords
in
the
realm.
Not
that
I’m
ungrateful,
my
lord,
but—why?”

“You
served
my
sister
well
in
the
matter
of
the
succession.”

“As
did
Janos
Slynt.
On
whom
this
same
castle
of
Harrenhal
was
quite
recently
bestowed—only
to
be
snatched
away
when
he
was
no
longer
of
use.”

Tyrion
laughed.
“You
have
me,
my
lord.
What
can
I
say?
I
need
you
to
deliver
the
Lady
Lysa.
I
did
not
need
Janos
Slynt.”
He
gave
a
crooked
shrug.
“I’d
sooner
have
you
seated
in
Harrenhal
than
Renly
seated
on
the
Iron
Throne.
What
could
be
plainer?”

“What
indeed.
You
realize
that
I
may
need
to
bed
Lysa
Arryn
again
to
get
her
consent
to
this
marriage?”

“I
have
little
doubt
you’ll
be
equal
to
the
task.”

“I
once
told
Ned
Stark
that
when
you
find
yourself
naked
with
an
ugly
woman,
the
only
thing
to
do
is
close
your
eyes
and
get
on
with
it.”
Littlefinger
steepled
his
fingers
and
gazed
into
Tyrion’s
mismatched
eyes.
“Give
me
a
fortnight
to
conclude
my
affairs
and
arrange
for
a
ship
to
carry
me
to
Gulltown.”

“That
will
do
nicely.”

His
guest
rose.
“This
has
been
quite
the
pleasant
morning,
Lannister.
And
profitable…
for
both
of
us,
I
trust.”
He
bowed,
his
cape
a
swirl
of
yellow
as
he
strode
out
the
door.

Two,
thought
Tyrion.

He
went
up
to
his
bedchamber
to
await
Varys,
who
would
soon
be
making
an
appearance.
Evenfall,
he
guessed.
Perhaps
as
late
as
moonrise,
though
he
hoped
not.
He
hoped
to
visit
Shae
tonight.
He
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
Galt
of
the
Stone
Crows
informed
him
not
an
hour
later
that
the
powdered
man
was
at
his
door.
“You
are
a
cruel
man,
to
make
the
Grand
Maester
squirm
so,”
the
eunuch
scolded.
“The
man
cannot
abide
a
secret.”

“Is
that
a
crow
I
hear,
calling
the
raven
black?
Or
would
you
sooner
not
hear
what
I’ve
proposed
to
Doran
Martell?”

Varys
giggled.
“Perhaps
my
little
birds
have
told
me.”

“Have
they,
indeed?”
He
wanted
to
hear
this.
“Go
on.”

“The
Dornishmen
thus
far
have
held
aloof
from
these
wars.
Doran
Martell
has
called
his
banners,
but
no
more.
His
hatred
for
House
Lannister
is
well
known,
and
it
is
commonly
thought
he
will
join
Lord
Renly.
You
wish
to
dissuade
him.”

“All
this
is
obvious,”
said
Tyrion.

“The
only
puzzle
is
what
you
might
have
offered
for
his
allegiance.
The
prince
is
a
sentimental
man,
and
he
still
mourns
his
sister
Elia
and
her
sweet
babe.”

“My
father
once
told
me
that
a
lord
never
lets
sentiment
get
in
the
way
of
ambition…
and
it
happens
we
have
an
empty
seat
on
the
small
council,
now
that
Lord
Janos
has
taken
the
black.”

“A
council
seat
is
not
to
be
despised,”
Varys
admitted,
“yet
will
it
be
enough
to
make
a
proud
man
forget
his
sister’s
murder?”

“Why
forget?”
Tyrion
smiled.
“I’ve
promised
to
deliver
his
sister’s
killers,
alive
or
dead,
as
he
prefers.
After
the
war
is
done,
to
be
sure.”

Varys
gave
him
a
shrewd
look.
“My
little
birds
tell
me
that
Princess
Elia
cried
a…
certain
name…
when
they
came
for
her.”

“Is
a
secret
still
a
secret
if
everyone
knows
it?”
In
Casterly
Rock,
it
was
common
knowledge
that
Gregor
Clegane
had
killed
Elia
and
her
babe.
They
said
he
had
raped
the
princess
with
her
son’s
blood
and
brains
still
on
his
hands.

“This
secret
is
your
lord
father’s
sworn
man.”

“My
father
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
that
fifty
thousand
Dornishmen
are
worth
one
rabid
dog.”

Varys
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
“And
if
Prince
Doran
demands
the
blood
of
the
lord
who
gave
the
command
as
well
as
the
knight
who
did
the
deed…”

“Robert
Baratheon
led
the
rebellion.
All
commands
came
from
him,
in
the
end.”

“Robert
was
not
at
King’s
Landing.”

“Neither
was
Doran
Martell.”

“So.
Blood
for
his
pride,
a
chair
for
his
ambition.
Gold
and
land,
that
goes
without
saying.
A
sweet
offer…
yet
sweets
can
be
poisoned.
If
I
were
the
prince,
something
more
would
I
require
before
I
should
reach
for
this
honeycomb.
Some
token
of
good
faith,
some
sure
safeguard
against
betrayal.”
Varys
smiled
his
slimiest
smile.
“Which
one
will
you
give
him,
I
wonder?”

Tyrion
sighed.
“You
know,
don’t
you?”

“Since
you
put
it
that
way—yes.
Tommen.
You
could
scarcely
offer
Myrcella
to
Doran
Martell
and
Lysa
Arryn
both.”

“Remind
me
never
to
play
these
guessing
games
with
you
again.
You
cheat.
“

“Prince
Tommen
is
a
good
boy.”

“If
I
pry
him
away
from
Cersei
and
Joffrey
while
he’s
still
young,
he
may
even
grow
to
be
a
good
man.”

“And
a
good
king?”

“Joffrey
is
king.”

“And
Tommen
is
heir,
should
anything
ill
befall
His
Grace.
Tommen,
whose
nature
is
so
sweet,
and
notably…
tractable.”

“You
have
a
suspicious
mind,
Varys.”

“I
shall
take
that
as
a
tribute,
my
lord.
In
any
case,
Prince
Doran
will
hardly
be
insensible
of
the
great
honor
you
do
him.
Very
deftly
done,
I
would
say…
but
for
one
small
flaw.”

The
dwarf
laughed.
“Named
Cersei?”

“What
avails
statecraft
against
the
love
of
a
mother
for
the
sweet
fruit
of
her
womb?
Perhaps,
for
the
glory
of
her
House
and
the
safety
of
the
realm,
the
queen
might
be
persuaded
to
send
away
Tommen
or
Myrcella.
But
both
of
them?
Surely
not.”

“What
Cersei
does
not
know
will
never
hurt
me.”

“And
if
Her
Grace
were
to
discover
your
intentions
before
your
plans
are
ripe?”

“Why,”
he
said,
“then
I
would
know
the
man
who
told
her
to
be
my
certain
enemy.”
And
when
Varys
giggled,
he
thought,
Three.





SANSA

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

The
words
were
the
same
on
the
hundredth
reading
as
they’d
been
on
the
first,
when
Sansa
had
discovered
the
folded
sheet
of
parchment
beneath
her
pillow.
She
did
not
know
how
it
had
gotten
there
or
who
had
sent
it.
The
note
was
unsigned,
unsealed,
and
the
hand
unfamiliar.
She
crushed
the
parchment
to
her
chest
and
whispered
the
words
to
herself.
“Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home,”
she
breathed,
ever
so
faintly.

What
could
it
mean?
Should
she
take
it
to
the
queen
to
prove
that
she
was
being
good?
Nervously,
she
rubbed
her
stomach.
The
angry
purple
bruise
Ser
Meryn
had
given
her
had
faded
to
an
ugly
yellow,
but
still
hurt.
His
fist
had
been
mailed
when
he
hit
her.
It
was
her
own
fault.
She
must
learn
to
hide
her
feelings
better,
so
as
not
to
anger
Joffrey.
When
she
heard
that
the
Imp
had
sent
Lord
Slynt
to
the
Wall,
she
had
forgotten
herself
and
said,
“I
hope
the
Others
get
him.”
The
king
had
not
been
pleased.

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

Sansa
had
prayed
so
hard.
Could
this
be
her
answer
at
last,
a
true
knight
sent
to
save
her?
Perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
Redwyne
twins,
or
bold
Ser
Balon
Swann…
or
even
Beric
Dondarrion,
the
young
lord
her
friend
Jeyne
Poole
had
loved,
with
his
red-gold
hair
and
the
spray
of
stars
on
his
black
cloak.

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

What
if
it
was
some
cruel
jape
of
Joffrey’s,
like
the
day
he
had
taken
her
up
to
the
battlements
to
show
her
Father’s
head?
Or
perhaps
it
was
some
subtle
snare
to
prove
she
was
not
loyal.
If
she
went
to
the
godswood,
would
she
find
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
waiting
for
her,
sitting
silent
under
the
heart
tree
with
Ice
in
his
hand,
his
pale
eyes
watching
to
see
if
she’d
come?

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

When
the
door
opened,
she
hurriedly
stuffed
the
note
under
her
sheet
and
sat
on
it.
It
was
her
bedmaid,
the
mousy
one
with
the
limp
brown
hair.
“What
do
you
want?”
Sansa
demanded.

“Will
milady
be
wanting
a
bath
tonight?”

“A
fire,
I
think…
I
feel
a
chill.”
She
was
shivering,
though
the
day
had
been
hot.

“As
you
wish.”

Sansa
watched
the
girl
suspiciously.
Had
she
seen
the
note?
Had
she
put
it
under
the
pillow?
It
did
not
seem
likely;
she
seemed
a
stupid
girl,
not
one
you’d
want
delivering
secret
notes,
but
Sansa
did
not
know
her.
The
queen
had
her
servants
changed
every
fortnight,
to
make
certain
none
of
them
befriended
her.

When
a
fire
was
blazing
in
the
hearth,
Sansa
thanked
the
maid
curtly
and
ordered
her
out.
The
girl
was
quick
to
obey,
as
ever,
but
Sansa
decided
there
was
something
sly
about
her
eyes.
Doubtless,
she
was
scurrying
off
to
report
to
the
queen,
or
maybe
Varys.
All
her
maids
spied
on
her,
she
was
certain.

Once
alone,
she
thrust
the
note
in
the
flames,
watching
the
parchment
curl
and
blacken.
Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.
She
drifted
to
her
window.
Below,
she
could
see
a
short
knight
in
moon-pale
armor
and
a
heavy
white
cloak
pacing
the
drawbridge.
From
his
height,
it
could
only
be
Ser
Preston
Greenfield.
The
queen
had
given
her
freedom
of
the
castle,
but
even
so,
he
would
want
to
know
where
she
was
going
if
she
tried
to
leave
Maegor’s
Holdfast
at
this
time
of
night.
What
was
she
to
tell
him?
Suddenly
she
was
glad
she
had
burned
the
note.

She
unlaced
her
gown
and
crawled
into
her
bed,
but
she
did
not
sleep.
Was
he
still
there?
she
wondered.
How
long
will
he
wait?
It
was
so
cruel,
to
send
her
a
note
and
tell
her
nothing.
The
thoughts
went
round
and
round
in
her
head.

If
only
she
had
someone
to
tell
her
what
to
do.
She
missed
Septa
Mordane,
and
even
more
Jeyne
Poole,
her
truest
friend.
The
septa
had
lost
her
head
with
the
rest,
for
the
crime
of
serving
House
Stark.
Sansa
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
Jeyne,
who
had
disappeared
from
her
rooms
afterward,
never
to
be
mentioned
again.
She
tried
not
to
think
of
them
too
often,
yet
sometimes
the
memories
came
unbidden,
and
then
it
was
hard
to
hold
back
the
tears.
Once
in
a
while,
Sansa
even
missed
her
sister.
By
now
Arya
was
safe
back
in
Winterfell,
dancing
and
sewing,
playing
with
Bran
and
baby
Rickon,
even
riding
through
the
winter
town
if
she
liked.
Sansa
was
allowed
to
go
riding
too,
but
only
in
the
bailey,
and
it
got
boring
going
round
in
a
circle
all
day.

She
was
wide
awake
when
she
heard
the
shouting.
Distant
at
first,
then
growing
louder.
Many
voices
yelling
together.
She
could
not
make
out
the
words.
And
there
were
horses
as
well,
and
pounding
feet,
shouts
of
command.
She
crept
to
her
window
and
saw
men
running
on
the
walls,
carrying
spears
and
torches.
Go
back
to
your
bed,
Sansa
told
herself,
this
is
nothing
that
concerns
you,
just
some
new
trouble
out
in
the
city.
The
talk
at
the
wells
had
all
been
of
troubles
in
the
city
of
late.
People
were
crowding
in,
running
from
the
war,
and
many
had
no
way
to
live
save
by
robbing
and
killing
each
other.
Go
to
bed.

But
when
she
looked,
the
white
knight
was
gone,
the
bridge
across
the
dry
moat
down
but
undefended.

Sansa
turned
away
without
thinking
and
ran
to
her
wardrobe.
Oh,
what
am
I
doing?
she
asked
herself
as
she
dressed.
This
is
madness.
She
could
see
the
lights
of
many
torches
on
the
curtain
walls.
Had
Stannis
and
Renly
come
at
last
to
kill
Joffrey
and
claim
their
brother’s
throne?
If
so,
the
guards
would
raise
the
drawbridge,
cutting
off
Maegor’s
Holdfast
from
the
outer
castle.
Sansa
threw
a
plain
grey
cloak
over
her
shoulders
and
picked
up
the
knife
she
used
to
cut
her
meat.
If
it
is
some
trap,
better
that
I
die
than
let
them
hurt
me
more,
she
told
herself.
She
hid
the
blade
under
her
cloak.

A
column
of
red-cloaked
swordsmen
ran
past
as
she
slipped
out
into
the
night.
She
waited
until
they
were
well
past
before
she
darted
across
the
undefended
drawbridge.
In
the
yard,
men
were
buckling
on
swordbelts
and
cinching
the
saddles
of
their
horses.
She
glimpsed
Ser
Preston
near
the
stables
with
three
others
of
the
Kingsguard,
white
cloaks
bright
as
the
moon
as
they
helped
Joffrey
into
his
armor.
Her
breath
caught
in
her
throat
when
she
saw
the
king.
Thankfully,
he
did
not
see
her.
He
was
shouting
for
his
sword
and
crossbow.

The
noise
receded
as
she
moved
deeper
into
the
castle,
never
daring
to
look
back
for
fear
that
Joffrey
might
be
watching…
or
worse,
following.
The
serpentine
steps
twisted
ahead,
striped
by
bars
of
flickering
light
from
the
narrow
windows
above.
Sansa
was
panting
by
the
time
she
reached
the
top.
She
ran
down
a
shadowy
colonnade
and
pressed
herself
against
a
wall
to
catch
her
breath.
When
something
brushed
against
her
leg,
she
almost
jumped
out
of
her
skin,
but
it
was
only
a
cat,
a
ragged
black
tom
with
a
chewed-off
ear.
The
creature
spit
at
her
and
leapt
away.

By
the
time
she
reached
the
godswood,
the
noises
had
faded
to
a
faint
rattle
of
steel
and
a
distant
shouting.
Sansa
pulled
her
cloak
tighter.
The
air
was
rich
with
the
smells
of
earth
and
leaf.
Lady
would
have
liked
this
place,
she
thought.
There
was
something
wild
about
a
godswood;
even
here,
in
the
heart
of
the
castle
at
the
heart
of
the
city,
you
could
feel
the
old
gods
watching
with
a
thousand
unseen
eyes.

Sansa
had
favored
her
mother’s
gods
over
her
father’s.
She
loved
the
statues,
the
pictures
in
leaded
glass,
the
fragrance
of
burning
incense,
the
septons
with
their
robes
and
crystals,
the
magical
play
of
the
rainbows
over
altars
inlaid
with
mother-of-pearl
and
onyx
and
lapis
lazuli.
Yet
she
could
not
deny
that
the
godswood
had
a
certain
power
too.
Especially
by
night.
Help
me,
she
prayed,
send
me
a
friend,
a
true
knight
to
champion
me…

She
moved
from
tree
to
tree,
feeling
the
roughness
of
the
bark
beneath
her
fingers.
Leaves
brushed
at
her
cheeks.
Had
she
come
too
late?
He
would
not
have
left
so
soon,
would
he?
Or
had
he
even
been
here?
Dare
she
risk
calling
out?
It
seemed
so
hushed
and
still
here…

“I
feared
you
would
not
come,
child.”

Sansa
whirled.
A
man
stepped
out
of
the
shadows,
heavyset,
thick
of
neck,
shambling.
He
wore
a
dark
grey
robe
with
the
cowl
pulled
forward,
but
when
a
thin
sliver
of
moonlight
touched
his
cheek,
she
knew
him
at
once
by
the
blotchy
skin
and
web
of
broken
veins
beneath.
“Ser
Dontos,”
she
breathed,
heartbroken.
“Was
it
you?”

“Yes,
my
lady.”
When
he
moved
closer,
she
could
smell
the
sour
stench
of
wine
on
his
breath.
“Me.”
He
reached
out
a
hand.

Sansa
shrank
back.
“Don’t!”
She
slid
her
hand
under
her
cloak,
to
her
hidden
knife.
“What…
what
do
you
want
with
me?”

“Only
to
help
you,”
Dontos
said,
“as
you
helped
me.”

“You’re
drunk,
aren’t
you?”

“Only
one
cup
of
wine,
to
help
my
courage.
If
they
catch
me
now,
they’ll
strip
the
skin
off
my
back.”

And
what
will
they
do
to
me?
Sansa
found
herself
thinking
of
Lady
again.
She
could
smell
out
falsehood,
she
could,
but
she
was
dead,
Father
had
killed
her,
on
account
of
Arya.
She
drew
the
knife
and
held
it
before
her
with
both
hands.

“Are
you
going
to
stab
me?”
Dontos
asked.

“I
will,”
she
said.
“Tell
me
who
sent
you.”

“No
one,
sweet
lady.
I
swear
it
on
my
honor
as
a
knight.”

“A
knight?”
Joffrey
had
decreed
that
he
was
to
be
a
knight
no
longer,
only
a
fool,
lower
even
than
Moon
Boy.
“I
prayed
to
the
gods
for
a
knight
to
come
save
me,”
she
said.
“I
prayed
and
prayed.
Why
would
they
send
me
a
drunken
old
fool?”

“I
deserve
that,
though…
I
know
it’s
queer,
but…
all
those
years
I
was
a
knight,
I
was
truly
a
fool,
and
now
that
I
am
a
fool
I
think…
I
think
I
may
find
it
in
me
to
be
a
knight
again,
sweet
lady.
And
all
because
of
you…
your
grace,
your
courage.
You
saved
me,
not
only
from
Joffrey,
but
from
myself.”
His
voice
dropped.
“The
singers
say
there
was
another
fool
once
who
was
the
greatest
knight
of
all…”

“Florian,”
Sansa
whispered.
A
shiver
went
through
her.

“Sweet
lady,
I
would
be
your
Florian,”
Dontos
said
humbly,
falling
to
his
knees
before
her.

Slowly,
Sansa
lowered
the
knife.
Her
head
seemed
terribly
light,
as
if
she
were
floating.
This
is
madness,
to
trust
myself
to
this
drunkard,
but
if
I
turn
away
will
the
chance
ever
come
again?
“How…
how
would
you
do
it?
Get
me
away?”

Ser
Dontos
raised
his
face
to
her.
“Taking
you
from
the
castle,
that
will
be
the
hardest.
Once
you’re
out,
there
are
ships
that
would
take
you
home.
I’d
need
to
find
the
coin
and
make
the
arrangements,
that’s
all.”

“Could
we
go
now?”
she
asked,
hardly
daring
to
hope.

“This
very
night?
No,
my
lady,
I
fear
not.
First
I
must
find
a
sure
way
to
get
you
from
the
castle
when
the
hour
is
ripe.
It
will
not
be
easy,
nor
quick.
They
watch
me
as
well.”
He
licked
his
lips
nervously.
“Will
you
put
away
your
blade?”

Sansa
slipped
the
knife
beneath
her
cloak.
“Rise,
ser.”

“Thank
you,
sweet
lady.”
Ser
Dontos
lurched
clumsily
to
his
feet,
and
brushed
earth
and
leaves
from
his
knees.
“Your
lord
father
was
as
true
a
man
as
the
realm
has
ever
known,
but
I
stood
by
and
let
them
slay
him.
I
said
nothing,
did
nothing…
and
yet,
when
Joffrey
would
have
slain
me,
you
spoke
up.
Lady,
I
have
never
been
a
hero,
no
Ryam
Redwyne
or
Barristan
the
Bold.
I’ve
won
no
tourneys,
no
renown
in
war…
but
I
was
a
knight
once,
and
you
have
helped
me
remember
what
that
meant.
My
life
is
a
poor
thing,
but
it
is
yours.”
Ser
Dontos
placed
a
hand
on
the
gnarled
bole
of
the
heart
tree.
He
was
shaking,
she
saw.
“I
vow,
with
your
father’s
gods
as
witness,
that
I
shall
send
you
home.”

He
swore.
A
solemn
oath,
before
the
gods.
“Then…
I
will
put
myself
in
your
hands,
ser.
But
how
will
I
know,
when
it
is
time
to
go?
Will
you
send
me
another
note?”

Ser
Dontos
glanced
about
anxiously.
“The
risk
is
too
great.
You
must
come
here,
to
the
godswood.
As
often
as
you
can.
This
is
the
safest
place.
The
only
safe
place.
Nowhere
else.
Not
in
your
chambers
nor
mine
nor
on
the
steps
nor
in
the
yard,
even
if
it
seems
we
are
alone.
The
stones
have
ears
in
the
Red
Keep,
and
only
here
may
we
talk
freely.”

“Only
here,”
Sansa
said.
“I’ll
remember.”

“And
if
I
should
seem
cruel
or
mocking
or
indifferent
when
men
are
watching,
forgive
me,
child.
I
have
a
role
to
play,
and
you
must
do
the
same.
One
misstep
and
our
heads
will
adorn
the
walls
as
did
your
father’s.”

She
nodded.
“I
understand.”

“You
will
need
to
be
brave
and
strong…
and
patient,
patient
above
all.”

“I
will
be,”
she
promised,
“but…
please…
make
it
as
soon
as
you
can.
I’m
afraid…”

“So
am
I,”
Ser
Dontos
said,
smiling
wanly.
“And
now
you
must
go,
before
you
are
missed.”

“You
will
not
come
with
me?”

“Better
if
we
are
never
seen
together.”

Nodding,
Sansa
took
a
step…
then
spun
back,
nervous,
and
softly
laid
a
kiss
on
his
cheek,
her
eyes
closed.
“My
Florian,”
she
whispered.
“The
gods
heard
my
prayer.”

She
flew
along
the
river
walk,
past
the
small
kitchen,
and
through
the
pig
yard,
her
hurried
footsteps
lost
beneath
the
squealing
of
the
hogs
in
their
pens.
Home,
she
thought,
home,
he
is
going
to
take
me
home,
he’ll
keep
me
safe,
my
Florian.
The
songs
about
Florian
and
Jonquil
were
her
very
favorites.
Florian
was
homely
too,
though
not
so
old.

She
was
racing
headlong
down
the
serpentine
steps
when
a
man
lurched
out
of
a
hidden
doorway.
Sansa
caromed
into
him
and
lost
her
balance.
Iron
fingers
caught
her
by
the
wrist
before
she
could
fall,
and
a
deep
voice
rasped
at
her.
“It’s
a
long
roll
down
the
serpentine,
little
bird.
Want
to
kill
us
both?”
His
laughter
was
rough
as
a
saw
on
stone.
“Maybe
you
do.”

The
Hound.
“No,
my
lord,
pardons,
I’d
never.”
Sansa
averted
her
eyes
but
it
was
too
late,
he’d
seen
her
face.
“Please,
you’re
hurting
me.”
She
tried
to
wriggle
free.

“And
what’s
Joff’s
little
bird
doing
flying
down
the
serpentine
in
the
black
of
night?”
When
she
did
not
answer,
he
shook
her.
“Where
were
you?”

“The
g-g-godswood,
my
lord,”
she
said,
not
daring
to
lie.
“Praying…
praying
for
my
father,
and…
for
the
king,
praying
that
he’d
not
be
hurt.”

“Think
I’m
so
drunk
that
I’d
believe
that?”
He
let
go
his
grip
on
her
arm,
swaying
slightly
as
he
stood,
stripes
of
light
and
darkness
falling
across
his
terrible
burnt
face.
“You
look
almost
a
woman…
face,
teats,
and
you’re
taller
too,
almost…
ah,
you’re
still
a
stupid
little
bird,
aren’t
you?
Singing
all
the
songs
they
taught
you…
sing
me
a
song,
why
don’t
you?
Go
on.
Sing
to
me.
Some
song
about
knights
and
fair
maids.
You
like
knights,
don’t
you?”

He
was
scaring
her.
“T-true
knights,
my
lord.”

“True
knights,”
he
mocked.
“And
I’m
no
lord,
no
more
than
I’m
a
knight.
Do
I
need
to
beat
that
into
you?”
Clegane
reeled
and
almost
fell.
“Gods,”
he
swore,
“too
much
wine.
Do
you
like
wine,
little
bird?
True
wine?
A
flagon
of
sour
red,
dark
as
blood,
all
a
man
needs.
Or
a
woman.”
He
laughed,
shook
his
head.
“Drunk
as
a
dog,
damn
me.
You
come
now.
Back
to
your
cage,
little
bird.
I’ll
take
you
there.
Keep
you
safe
for
the
king.”
The
Hound
gave
her
a
push,
oddly
gentle,
and
followed
her
down
the
steps.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom,
he
had
lapsed
back
into
a
brooding
silence,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
she
was
there.

When
they
reached
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
she
was
alarmed
to
see
that
it
was
Ser
Boros
Blount
who
now
held
the
bridge.
His
high
white
helm
turned
stiffly
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps.
Sansa
flinched
away
from
his
gaze.
Ser
Boros
was
the
worst
of
the
Kingsguard,
an
ugly
man
with
a
foul
temper,
all
scowls
and
jowls.

“That
one
is
nothing
to
fear,
girl.”
The
Hound
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder.
“Paint
stripes
on
a
toad,
he
does
not
become
a
tiger.”

Ser
Boros
lifted
his
visor.
“Ser,
where—”

“Fuck
your
ser,
Boros.
You’re
the
knight,
not
me.
I’m
the
king’s
dog,
remember?
“

“The
king
was
looking
for
his
dog
earlier.”

“The
dog
was
drinking.
It
was
your
night
to
shield
him,
ser.
You
and
my
other
brothers.”

Ser
Boros
turned
to
Sansa.
“How
is
it
you
are
not
in
your
chambers
at
this
hour,
lady?”

“I
went
to
the
godswood
to
pray
for
the
safety
of
the
king.”
The
lie
sounded
better
this
time,
almost
true.

“You
expect
her
to
sleep
with
all
the
noise?”
Clegane
said.
“What
was
the
trouble?”

“Fools
at
the
gate,”
Ser
Boros
admitted.
“Some
loose
tongues
spread
tales
of
the
preparations
for
Tyrek’s
wedding
feast,
and
these
wretches
got
it
in
their
heads
they
should
be
feasted
too.
His
Grace
led
a
sortie
and
sent
them
scurrying.”

“A
brave
boy,”
Clegane
said,
mouth
twitching.

Let
us
see
how
brave
he
is
when
he
faces
my
brother,
Sansa
thought.
The
Hound
escorted
her
across
the
drawbridge.
As
they
were
winding
their
way
up
the
steps,
she
said,
“Why
do
you
let
people
call
you
a
dog?
You
won’t
let
anyone
call
you
a
knight.”

“I
like
dogs
better
than
knights.
My
father’s
father
was
kennelmaster
at
the
Rock.
One
autumn
year,
Lord
Tytos
came
between
a
lioness
and
her
prey.
The
lioness
didn’t
give
a
shit
that
she
was
Lannister’s
own
sigil.
Bitch
tore
into
my
lord’s
horse
and
would
have
done
for
my
lord
too,
but
my
grandfather
came
up
with
the
hounds.
Three
of
his
dogs
died
running
her
off.
My
grandfather
lost
a
leg,
so
Lannister
paid
him
for
it
with
lands
and
a
towerhouse,
and
took
his
son
to
squire.
The
three
dogs
on
our
banner
are
the
three
that
died,
in
the
yellow
of
autumn
grass.
A
hound
will
die
for
you,
but
never
lie
to
you.
And
he’ll
look
you
straight
in
the
face.”
He
cupped
her
under
the
jaw,
raising
her
chin,
his
fingers
pinching
her
painfully.
“And
that’s
more
than
little
birds
can
do,
isn’t
it?
I
never
got
my
song.”

“I…
I
know
a
song
about
Florian
and
Jonquil.”

“Florian
and
Jonquil?
A
fool
and
his
cunt.
Spare
me.
But
one
day
I’ll
have
a
song
from
you,
whether
you
will
it
or
no.”

“I
will
sing
it
for
you
gladly.”

Sandor
Clegane
snorted.
“Pretty
thing,
and
such
a
bad
liar.
A
dog
can
smell
a
lie,
you
know.
Look
around
you,
and
take
a
good
whiff.
They’re
all
liars
here…
and
every
one
better
than
you.”





ARYA

When
she
climbed
all
the
way
up
to
the
highest
branch,
Arya
could
see
chimneys
poking
through
the
trees.
Thatched
roofs
clustered
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
the
small
stream
that
emptied
into
it,
and
a
wooden
pier
jutted
out
into
the
water
beside
a
low
long
building
with
a
slate
roof.

She
skinnied
farther
out,
until
the
branch
began
to
sag
under
her
weight.
No
boats
were
tied
to
the
pier,
but
she
could
see
thin
tendrils
of
smoke
rising
from
some
of
the
chimneys,
and
part
of
a
wagon
jutting
out
behind
a
stable.

Someone’s
there.
Arya
chewed
her
lip.
All
the
other
places
they’d
come
upon
had
been
empty
and
desolate.
Farms,
villages,
castles,
septs,
barns,
it
made
no
matter.
If
it
could
burn,
the
Lannisters
had
burned
it;
if
it
could
die,
they’d
killed
it.
They
had
even
set
the
woods
ablaze
where
they
could,
though
the
leaves
were
still
green
and
wet
from
recent
rains,
and
the
fires
had
not
spread.
“They
would
have
burned
the
lake
if
they
could
have,”
Gendry
had
said,
and
Arya
knew
he
was
right.
On
the
night
of
their
escape,
the
flames
of
the
burning
town
had
shimmered
so
brightly
on
the
water
that
it
had
seemed
that
the
lake
was
afire.

When
they
finally
summoned
the
nerve
to
steal
back
into
the
ruins
the
next
night,
nothing
remained
but
blackened
stones,
the
hollow
shells
of
houses,
and
corpses.
In
some
places
wisps
of
pale
smoke
still
rose
from
the
ashes.
Hot
Pie
had
pleaded
with
them
not
to
go
back,
and
Lommy
called
them
fools
and
swore
that
Ser
Amory
would
catch
them
and
kill
them
too,
but
Lorch
and
his
men
had
long
gone
by
the
time
they
reached
the
holdfast.
They
found
the
gates
broken
down,
the
walls
partly
demolished,
and
the
inside
strewn
with
the
unburied
dead.
One
look
was
enough
for
Gendry.
“They’re
killed,
every
one,”
he
said.
“And
dogs
have
been
at
them
too,
look.”

“Or
wolves.”

“Dogs,
wolves,
it
makes
no
matter.
It’s
done
here.”

But
Arya
would
not
leave
until
they
found
Yoren.
They
couldn’t
have
killed
him,
she
told
herself,
he
was
too
hard
and
tough,
and
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
besides.
She
said
as
much
to
Gendry
as
they
searched
among
the
corpses.

The
axe
blow
that
had
killed
him
had
split
his
skull
apart,
but
the
great
tangled
beard
could
be
no
one
else’s,
or
the
garb,
patched
and
unwashed
and
so
faded
it
was
more
grey
than
black.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
had
given
no
more
thought
to
burying
his
own
dead
than
to
those
he
had
murdered,
and
the
corpses
of
four
Lannister
men-at-arms
were
heaped
near
Yoren’s.
Arya
wondered
how
many
it
had
taken
to
bring
him
down.

He
was
going
to
take
me
home,
she
thought
as
they
dug
the
old
man’s
hole.
There
were
too
many
dead
to
bury
them
all,
but
Yoren
at
least
must
have
a
grave,
Arya
had
insisted.
He
was
going
to
bring
me
safe
to
Winterfell,
he
promised.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
cry.
The
other
part
wanted
to
kick
him.

It
was
Gendry
who
thought
of
the
lord’s
towerhouse
and
the
three
that
Yoren
had
sent
to
hold
it.
They
had
come
under
attack
as
well,
but
the
round
tower
had
only
one
entry,
a
second-story
door
reached
by
a
ladder.
Once
that
had
been
pulled
inside,
Ser
Amory’s
men
could
not
get
at
them.
The
Lannisters
had
piled
brush
around
the
tower’s
base
and
set
it
afire,
but
the
stone
would
not
burn,
and
Lorch
did
not
have
the
patience
to
starve
them
out.
Cutjack
opened
the
door
at
Gendry’s
shout,
and
when
Kurz
said
they’d
be
better
pressing
on
north
than
going
back,
Arya
had
clung
to
the
hope
that
she
still
might
reach
Winterfell.

Well,
this
village
was
no
Winterfell,
but
those
thatched
roofs
promised
warmth
and
shelter
and
maybe
even
food,
if
they
were
bold
enough
to
risk
them.
Unless
it’s
Lorch
there.
He
had
horses;
he
would
have
traveled
faster
than
us.

She
watched
from
the
tree
for
a
long
time,
hoping
she
might
see
something;
a
man,
a
horse,
a
banner,
anything
that
would
help
her
know.
A
few
times
she
glimpsed
motion,
but
the
buildings
were
so
far
off
it
was
hard
to
be
certain.
Once,
very
clearly,
she
heard
the
whinny
of
a
horse.

The
air
was
full
of
birds,
crows
mostly.
From
afar,
they
were
no
larger
than
flies
as
they
wheeled
and
flapped
above
the
thatched
roofs.
To
the
east,
Gods
Eye
was
a
sheet
of
sun-hammered
blue
that
filled
half
the
world.
Some
days,
as
they
made
their
slow
way
up
the
muddy
shore
(Gendry
wanted
no
part
of
any
roads,
and
even
Hot
Pie
and
Lommy
saw
the
sense
in
that),
Arya
felt
as
though
the
lake
were
calling
her.
She
wanted
to
leap
into
those
placid
blue
waters,
to
feel
clean
again,
to
swim
and
splash
and
bask
in
the
sun.
But
she
dare
not
take
off
her
clothes
where
the
others
could
see,
not
even
to
wash
them.
At
the
end
of
the
day
she
would
often
sit
on
a
rock
and
dangle
her
feet
in
the
cool
water.
She
had
finally
thrown
away
her
cracked
and
rotted
shoes.
Walking
barefoot
was
hard
at
first,
but
the
blisters
had
finally
broken,
the
cuts
had
healed,
and
her
soles
had
turned
to
leather.
The
mud
was
nice
between
her
toes,
and
she
liked
to
feel
the
earth
underfoot
when
she
walked.

From
up
here,
she
could
see
a
small
wooded
island
off
to
the
northeast.
Thirty
yards
from
shore,
three
black
swans
were
gliding
over
the
water,
so
serene…
no
one
had
told
them
that
war
had
come,
and
they
cared
nothing
for
burning
towns
and
butchered
men.
She
stared
at
them
with
yearning.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
be
a
swan.
The
other
part
wanted
to
eat
one.
She
had
broken
her
fast
on
some
acorn
paste
and
a
handful
of
bugs.
Bugs
weren’t
so
bad
when
you
got
used
to
them.
Worms
were
worse,
but
still
not
as
bad
as
the
pain
in
your
belly
after
days
without
food.
Finding
bugs
was
easy,
all
you
had
to
do
was
kick
over
a
rock.
Arya
had
eaten
a
bug
once
when
she
was
little,
just
to
make
Sansa
screech,
so
she
hadn’t
been
afraid
to
eat
another.
Weasel
wasn’t
either,
but
Hot
Pie
retched
up
the
beetle
he
tried
to
swallow,
and
Lommy
and
Gendry
wouldn’t
even
try.
Yesterday
Gendry
had
caught
a
frog
and
shared
it
with
Lommy,
and,
a
few
days
before,
Hot
Pie
had
found
blackberries
and
stripped
the
bush
bare,
but
mostly
they
had
been
living
on
water
and
acorns.
Kurz
had
told
them
how
to
use
rocks
and
make
a
kind
of
acorn
paste.
it
tasted
awful.

She
wished
the
poacher
hadn’t
died.
He’d
known
more
about
the
woods
than
all
the
rest
of
them
together,
but
he’d
taken
an
arrow
through
the
shoulder
pulling
in
the
ladder
at
the
towerhouse.
Tarber
had
packed
it
with
mud
and
moss
from
the
lake,
and
for
a
day
or
two
Kurz
swore
the
wound
was
nothing,
even
though
the
flesh
of
his
throat
was
turning
dark
while
angry
red
welts
crept
up
his
jaw
and
down
his
chest.
Then
one
morning
he
couldn’t
find
the
strength
to
get
up,
and
by
the
next
he
was
dead.

They
buried
him
under
a
mound
of
stones,
and
Cutjack
had
claimed
his
sword
and
hunting
horn,
while
Tarber
helped
himself
to
bow
and
boots
and
knife.
They’d
taken
it
all
when
they
left.
At
first
they
thought
the
two
had
just
gone
hunting,
that
they’d
soon
return
with
game
and
feed
them
all.
But
they
waited
and
waited,
until
finally
Gendry
made
them
move
on.
Maybe
Tarber
and
Cutjack
figured
they
would
stand
a
better
chance
without
a
gaggle
of
orphan
boys
to
herd
along.
They
probably
would
too,
but
that
didn’t
stop
her
hating
them
for
leaving.

Beneath
her
tree,
Hot
Pie
barked
like
a
dog.
Kurz
had
told
them
to
use
animal
sounds
to
signal
to
each
other.
An
old
poacher’s
trick,
he’d
said,
but
he’d
died
before
he
could
teach
them
how
to
make
the
sounds
right.
Hot
Pie’s
bird
calls
were
awful.
His
dog
was
better,
but
not
much.

Arya
hopped
from
the
high
branch
to
one
beneath
it,
her
hands
out
for
balance.
A
water
dancer
never
falls.
Lightfoot,
her
toes
curled
tight
around
the
branch,
she
walked
a
few
feet,
hopped
down
to
a
larger
limb,
then
swung
hand
over
hand
through
the
tangle
of
leaves
until
she
reached
the
trunk.
The
bark
was
rough
beneath
her
fingers,
against
her
toes.
She
descended
quickly,
jumping
down
the
final
six
feet,
rolling
when
she
landed.

Gendry
gave
her
a
hand
to
pull
her
up.
“You
were
up
there
a
long
time.
What
could
you
see?”

“A
fishing
village,
just
a
little
place,
north
along
the
shore.
Twenty-six
thatch
roofs
and
one
slate,
I
counted.
I
saw
part
of
a
wagon.
Someone’s
there.”

At
the
sound
of
her
voice,
Weasel
came
creeping
out
from
the
bushes.
Lommy
had
named
her
that.
He
said
she
looked
like
a
weasel,
which
wasn’t
true,
but
they
couldn’t
keep
on
calling
her
the
crying
girl
after
she
finally
stopped
crying.
Her
mouth
was
filthy.
Arya
hoped
she
hadn’t
been
eating
mud
again.

“Did
you
see
people?”
asked
Gendry.

“Mostly
just
roofs,”
Arya
admitted,
“but
some
chimneys
were
smoking,
and
I
heard
a
horse.”
The
Weasel
put
her
arms
around
her
leg,
clutching
tight.
Sometimes
she
did
that
now.

“If
there’s
people,
there’s
food,”
Hot
Pie
said,
too
loudly.
Gendry
was
always
telling
him
to
be
more
quiet,
but
it
never
did
any
good.
“Might
be
they’d
give
us
some.”

“Might
be
they’d
kill
us
too,”
Gendry
said.

“Not
if
we
yielded,”
Hot
Pie
said
hopefully.

“Now
you
sound
like
Lommy.”

Lommy
Greenhands
sat
propped
up
between
two
thick
roots
at
the
foot
of
an
oak.
A
spear
had
taken
him
through
his
left
calf
during
the
fight
at
the
holdfast.
By
the
end
of
the
next
day,
he
had
to
limp
along
one-legged
with
an
arm
around
Gendry,
and
now
he
couldn’t
even
do
that.
They’d
hacked
branches
off
trees
to
make
a
litter
for
him,
but
it
was
slow,
hard
work
carrying
him
along,
and
he
whimpered
every
time
they
jounced
him.

“We
have
to
yield,”
he
said.
“That’s
what
Yoren
should
have
done.
He
should
have
opened
the
gates
like
they
said.”

Arya
was
sick
of
Lommy
going
on
about
how
Yoren
should
have
yielded.
It
was
all
he
talked
about
when
they
carried
him,
that
and
his
leg
and
his
empty
belly.

Hot
Pie
agreed.
“They
told
Yoren
to
open
the
gates,
they
told
him
in
the
king’s
name.
You
have
to
do
what
they
tell
you
in
the
king’s
name.
It
was
that
stinky
old
man’s
fault.
If
he’d
of
yielded,
they
would
have
left
us
be.”

Gendry
frowned.
“Knights
and
lordlings,
they
take
each
other
captive
and
pay
ransoms,
but
they
don’t
care
if
the
likes
of
you
yield
or
not.”
He
turned
to
Arya.
“What
else
did
you
see?”

“If
it’s
a
fishing
village,
they’d
sell
us
fish,
I
bet,”
said
Hot
Pie.
The
lake
teemed
with
fresh
fish,
but
they
had
nothing
to
catch
them
with.
Arya
had
tried
to
use
her
hands,
the
way
she’d
seen
Koss
do,
but
fish
were
quicker
than
pigeons
and
the
water
played
tricks
on
her
eyes.

“I
don’t
know
about
fish.”
Arya
tugged
at
the
Weasel’s
matted
hair,
thinking
it
might
be
best
to
hack
it
off.
“There’s
crows
down
by
the
water.
Something’s
dead
there.”

“Fish,
washed
up
on
shore,”
Hot
Pie
said.
“If
the
crows
eat
it,
I
bet
we
could.”

“We
should
catch
some
crows,
we
could
eat
them,”
said
Lommy.
“We
could
make
a
fire
and
roast
them
like
chickens.”

Gendry
looked
fierce
when
he
scowled.
His
beard
had
grown
in
thick
and
black
as
briar.
“I
said,
no
fires.”

“Lommy’s
hungry,”
Hot
Pie
whined,
“and
I
am
too.”

“We’re
all
hungry,”
said
Arya.

“You’re
not,”
Lommy
spat
from
the
ground.
“Worm
breath.”

Arya
could
have
kicked
him
in
his
wound.
“I
said
I’d
dig
worms
for
you
too,
if
you
wanted.”

Lommy
made
a
disgusted
face.
“If
it
wasn’t
for
my
leg,
I’d
hunt
us
some
boars.”

“Some
boars,”
she
mocked.
“You
need
a
boarspear
to
hunt
boars,
and
horses
and
dogs,
and
men
to
flush
the
boar
from
its
lair.”
Her
father
had
hunted
boar
in
the
wolfswood
with
Robb
and
Jon.
Once
he
even
took
Bran,
but
never
Arya,
even
though
she
was
older.
Septa
Mordane
said
boar
hunting
was
not
for
ladies,
and
Mother
only
promised
that
when
she
was
older
she
might
have
her
own
hawk.
She
was
older
now,
but
if
she
had
a
hawk
she’d
eat
it.

“What
do
you
know
about
hunting
boars?”
said
Hot
Pie.

“More
than
you.”

Gendry
was
in
no
mood
to
hear
it.
“Quiet,
both
of
you,
I
need
to
think
what
to
do.”
He
always
looked
pained
when
he
tried
to
think,
like
it
hurt
him
something
fierce.

“Yield,”
Lommy
said.

“I
told
you
to
shut
up
about
the
yielding.
We
don’t
even
know
who’s
in
there.
Maybe
we
can
steal
some
food.”

“Lommy
could
steal,
if
it
wasn’t
for
his
leg,”
said
Hot
Pie.
“He
was
a
thief
in
the
city.”

“A
bad
thief,”
Arya
said,
“or
he
wouldn’t
have
got
caught.”

Gendry
squinted
up
at
the
sun.
“Evenfall
will
be
the
best
time
to
sneak
in.
I’ll
go
scout
come
dark.”

“No,
I’ll
go,”
Arya
said.
“You’re
too
noisy.”

Gendry
got
that
look
on
his
face.
“We’ll
both
go.”

“Arry
should
go,”
said
Lommy.
“He’s
sneakier
than
you
are.”

“We’ll
both
go,
I
said.”

“But
what
if
you
don’t
come
back?
Hot
Pie
can’t
carry
me
by
himself,
you
know
he
can’t…”

“And
there’s
wolves,”
Hot
Pie
said.
“I
heard
them
last
night,
when
I
had
the
watch.
They
sounded
close.”

Arya
had
heard
them
too.
She’d
been
asleep
in
the
branches
of
an
elm,
but
the
howling
had
woken
her.
She’d
sat
awake
for
a
good
hour,
listening
to
them,
prickles
creeping
up
her
spine.

“And
you
won’t
even
let
us
have
a
fire
to
keep
them
off,”
Hot
Pie
said.
“It’s
not
right,
leaving
us
for
the
wolves.”

“No
one
is
leaving
you,”
Gendry
said
in
disgust.
“Lommy
has
his
spear
if
the
wolves
come,
and
you’ll
be
with
him.
We’re
just
going
to
go
see,
that’s
all;
we’re
coming
back.”

“Whoever
it
is,
you
should
yield
to
them,”
Lommy
whined.
“I
need
some
potion
for
my
leg,
it
hurts
bad.”

“If
we
see
any
leg
potion,
we’ll
bring
it,”
Gendry
said.
“Arry,
let’s
go,
I
want
to
get
near
before
the
sun
is
down.
Hot
Pie,
you
keep
Weasel
here,
I
don’t
want
her
following.”

“Last
time
she
kicked
me.”

“I’ll
kick
you
if
you
don’t
keep
her
here.”
Without
waiting
for
an
answer,
Gendry
donned
his
steel
helm
and
walked
off.

Arya
had
to
scamper
to
keep
up.
Gendry
was
five
years
older
and
a
foot
taller
than
she
was,
and
long
of
leg
as
well.
For
a
while
he
said
nothing,
just
plowed
on
through
the
trees
with
an
angry
look
on
his
face,
making
too
much
noise.
But
finally
he
stopped
and
said,
“I
think
Lommy’s
going
to
die.”

She
was
not
surprised.
Kurz
had
died
of
his
wound,
and
he’d
been
a
lot
stronger
than
Lommy.
Whenever
it
was
Arya’s
turn
to
help
carry
him,
she
could
feel
how
warm
his
skin
was,
and
smell
the
stink
off
his
leg.
“Maybe
we
could
find
a
maester…”

“You
only
find
maesters
in
castles,
and
even
if
we
found
one,
he
wouldn’t
dirty
his
hands
on
the
likes
of
Lommy.”
Gendry
ducked
under
a
low-hanging
limb.

“That’s
not
true.”
Maester
Luwin
would
have
helped
anyone
who
came
to
him,
she
was
certain.

“He’s
going
to
die,
and
the
sooner
he
does
it,
the
better
for
the
rest
of
us.
We
should
just
leave
him,
like
he
says.
If
it
was
you
or
me
hurt,
you
know
he’d
leave
us.”
They
scrambled
down
a
steep
cut
and
up
the
other
side,
using
roots
for
handholds.
“I’m
sick
of
carrying
him,
and
I’m
sick
of
all
his
talk
about
yielding
too.
If
he
could
stand
up,
I’d
knock
his
teeth
in.
Lommy’s
no
use
to
anyone.
That
crying
girl’s
no
use
either.”

“You
leave
Weasel
alone,
she’s
just
scared
and
hungry
is
all.”
Arya
glanced
back,
but
the
girl
was
not
following
for
once.
Hot
Pie
must
have
grabbed
her,
like
Gendry
had
told
him.

“She’s
no
use,”
Gendry
repeated
stubbornly.
“Her
and
Hot
Pie
and
Lommy,
they’re
slowing
us
down,
and
they’re
going
to
get
us
killed.
You’re
the
only
one
of
the
bunch
who’s
good
for
anything.
Even
if
you
are
a
girl.”

Arya
froze
in
her
steps.
“I’m
not
a
girl!”

“Yes
you
are.
Do
you
think
I’m
as
stupid
as
they
are?”

“No,
you’re
stupider.
The
Night’s
Watch
doesn’t
take
girls,
everyone
knows
that.”

“That’s
true.
I
don’t
know
why
Yoren
brought
you,
but
he
must
have
had
some
reason.
You’re
still
a
girl.”

“I
am
not!”

“Then
pull
out
your
cock
and
take
a
piss.
Go
on.”

“I
don’t
need
to
take
a
piss.
If
I
wanted
to
I
could.”

“Liar.
You
can’t
take
out
your
cock
because
you
don’t
have
one.
I
never
noticed
before
when
there
were
thirty
of
us,
but
you
always
go
off
in
the
woods
to
make
your
water.
You
don’t
see
Hot
Pie
doing
that,
nor
me
neither.
If
you’re
not
a
girl,
you
must
be
some
eunuch.”

“You’re
the
eunuch.”

“You
know
I’m
not.”
Gendry
smiled.
“You
want
me
to
take
out
my
cock
and
prove
it?
I
don’t
have
anything
to
hide.”

“Yes
you
do,”
Arya
blurted,
desperate
to
escape
the
subject
of
the
cock
she
didn’t
have.
“Those
gold
cloaks
were
after
you
at
the
inn,
and
you
won’t
tell
us
why.”

“I
wish
I
knew.
I
think
Yoren
knew,
but
he
never
told
me.
Why
did
you
think
they
were
after
you,
though?”

Arya
bit
her
lip.
She
remembered
what
Yoren
had
said,
the
day
he
had
hacked
off
her
hair.
This
lot,
half
o’
them
would
turn
you
over
to
the
queen
quick
as
spit
for
a
pardon
and
maybe
a
few
silvers.
The
other
half’d
do
the
same,
only
they’d
rape
you
first.
Only
Gendry
was
different,
the
queen
wanted
him
too.
“I’ll
tell
you
if
you’ll
tell
me,”
she
said
warily.

“I
would
if
I
knew,
Arry…
is
that
really
what
you’re
called,
or
do
you
have
some
girl’s
name?”

Arya
glared
at
the
gnarled
root
by
her
feet.
She
realized
that
the
pretense
was
done.
Gendry
knew,
and
she
had
nothing
in
her
pants
to
convince
him
otherwise.
She
could
draw
Needle
and
kill
him
where
he
stood,
or
else
trust
him.
She
wasn’t
certain
she’d
be
able
to
kill
him,
even
if
she
tried;
he
had
his
own
sword,
and
he
was
a
lot
stronger.
All
that
was
left
was
the
truth.
“Lommy
and
Hot
Pie
can’t
know,”
she
said.

“They
won’t,”
he
swore.
“Not
from
me.”

“Arya.”
She
raised
her
eyes
to
his.
“My
name
is
Arya.
Of
House
Stark.”

“Of
House…”
It
took
him
a
moment
before
he
said,
“The
King’s
Hand
was
named
Stark.
The
one
they
killed
for
a
traitor.”

“He
was
never
a
traitor.
He
was
my
father.”

Gendry’s
eyes
widened.
“So
that’s
why
you
thought…”

She
nodded.
“Yoren
was
taking
me
home
to
Winterfell.”

“I…
you’re
highborn
then,
a…
you’ll
be
a
lady…”

Arya
looked
down
at
her
ragged
clothes
and
bare
feet,
all
cracked
and
callused.
She
saw
the
dirt
under
her
nails,
the
scabs
on
her
elbows,
the
scratches
on
her
hands.
Septa
Mordane
wouldn’t
even
know
me,
I
bet.
Sansa
might,
but
she’d
pretend
not
to.
“My
mother’s
a
lady,
and
my
sister,
but
I
never
was.”

“Yes
you
were.
You
were
a
lord’s
daughter
and
you
lived
in
a
castle,
didn’t
you?
And
you…
gods
be
good,
I
never…”
All
of
a
sudden
Gendry
seemed
uncertain,
almost
afraid.
“All
that
about
cocks,
I
never
should
have
said
that.
And
I
been
pissing
in
front
of
you
and
everything,
I…
I
beg
your
pardon,
m’lady.”

“Stop
that!”
Arya
hissed.
Was
he
mocking
her?

“I
know
my
courtesies,
m’lady,”
Gendry
said,
stubborn
as
ever.
“Whenever
highborn
girls
came
into
the
shop
with
their
fathers,
my
master
told
me
I
was
to
bend
the
knee,
and
speak
only
when
they
spoke
to
me,
and
call
them
m’lady.”

“If
you
start
calling
me
m’lady,
even
Hot
Pie
is
going
to
notice.
And
you
better
keep
on
pissing
the
same
way
too.”

“As
m’lady
commands.”

Arya
slammed
his
chest
with
both
hands.
He
tripped
over
a
stone
and
sat
down
with
a
thump.
“What
kind
of
lord’s
daughter
are
you?”
he
said,
laughing.

“This
kind.”
She
kicked
him
in
the
side,
but
it
only
made
him
laugh
harder.
“You
laugh
all
you
like.
I’m
going
to
see
who’s
in
the
village.”
The
sun
had
already
fallen
below
the
trees;
dusk
would
be
on
them
in
no
time
at
all.
For
once
it
was
Gendry
who
had
to
hurry
after.
“You
smell
that?”
she
asked.

He
sniffed
the
air.
“Rotten
fish?”

“You
know
it’s
not.”

“We
better
be
careful.
I’ll
go
around
west,
see
if
there’s
some
road.
There
must
be
if
you
saw
a
wagon.
You
take
the
shore.
If
you
need
help,
bark
like
a
dog.”

“That’s
stupid.
If
I
need
help,
I’ll
shout
help.”
She
darted
away,
bare
feet
silent
in
the
grass.
When
she
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder,
he
was
watching
her
with
that
pained
look
on
his
face
that
meant
he
was
thinking.
He’s
probably
thinking
that
he
shouldn’t
be
letting
m’lady
go
stealing
food.
Arya
just
knew
he
was
going
to
be
stupid
now.

The
smell
grew
stronger
as
she
got
closer
to
the
village.
It
did
not
smell
like
rotten
fish
to
her.
This
stench
was
ranker,
fouler.
She
wrinkled
her
nose.

Where
the
trees
began
to
thin,
she
used
the
undergrowth,
slipping
from
bush
to
bush
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Every
few
yards
she
stopped
to
listen.
The
third
time,
she
heard
horses,
and
a
man’s
voice
as
well.
And
the
smell
got
worse.
Dead
man’s
stink,
that’s
what
it
is.
She
had
smelled
it
before,
with
Yoren
and
the
others.

A
dense
thicket
of
brambles
grew
south
of
the
village.
By
the
time
she
reached
it,
the
long
shadows
of
sunset
had
begun
to
fade,
and
the
lantern
bugs
were
coming
out.
She
could
see
thatched
roofs
just
beyond
the
hedge.
She
crept
along
until
she
found
a
gap
and
squirmed
through
on
her
belly,
keeping
well
hidden
until
she
saw
what
made
the
smell.

Beside
the
gently
lapping
waters
of
Gods
Eye,
a
long
gibbet
of
raw
green
wood
had
been
thrown
up,
and
things
that
had
once
been
men
dangled
there,
their
feet
in
chains,
while
crows
pecked
at
their
flesh
and
flapped
from
corpse
to
corpse.
For
every
crow
there
were
a
hundred
flies.
When
the
wind
blew
off
the
lake,
the
nearest
corpse
twisted
on
its
chain,
ever
so
slightly.
The
crows
had
eaten
most
of
its
face,
and
something
else
had
been
at
it
as
well,
something
much
larger.
Throat
and
chest
had
been
torn
apart,
and
glistening
green
entrails
and
ribbons
of
ragged
flesh
dangled
from
where
the
belly
had
been
opened.
one
arm
had
been
ripped
right
off
the
shoulder;
Arya
saw
the
bones
a
few
feet
away,
gnawed
and
cracked,
picked
clean
of
meat.

She
made
herself
look
at
the
next
man
and
the
one
beyond
him
and
the
one
beyond
him,
telling
herself
she
was
hard
as
a
stone.
Corpses
all,
so
savaged
and
decayed
that
it
took
her
a
moment
to
realize
they
had
been
stripped
before
they
were
hanged.
They
did
not
look
like
naked
people;
they
hardly
looked
like
people
at
all.
The
crows
had
eaten
their
eyes,
and
sometimes
their
faces.
Of
the
sixth
in
the
long
row,
nothing
remained
but
a
single
leg,
still
tangled
in
its
chains,
swaying
with
each
breeze.

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Dead
men
could
not
hurt
her,
but
whoever
had
killed
them
could.
Well
beyond
the
gibbet,
two
men
in
mail
hauberks
stood
leaning
on
their
spears
in
front
of
the
long
low
building
by
the
water,
the
one
with
the
slate
roof.
A
pair
of
tall
poles
had
been
driven
into
the
muddy
ground
in
front
of
it,
banners
drooping
from
each
staff.
One
looked
red
and
one
paler,
white
or
yellow
maybe,
but
both
were
limp
and
with
the
dusk
settling,
she
could
not
even
be
certain
that
red
one
was
Lannister
crimson.
I
don’t
need
to
see
the
lion,
I
can
see
all
the
dead
people,
who
else
would
it
be
but
Lannisters?

Then
there
was
a
shout.

The
two
spearmen
turned
at
the
cry,
and
a
third
man
came
into
view,
shoving
a
captive
before
him.
It
was
growing
too
dark
to
make
out
faces,
but
the
prisoner
was
wearing
a
shiny
steel
helm,
and
when
Arya
saw
the
horns
she
knew
it
was
Gendry.
You
stupid
stupid
stupid
STUPID!
she
thought.
If
he’d
been
here
she
would
have
kicked
him
again.

The
guards
were
talking
loudly,
but
she
was
too
far
away
to
make
out
the
words,
especially
with
the
crows
gabbling
and
flapping
closer
to
hand.
One
of
the
spearmen
snatched
the
helm
off
Gendry’s
head
and
asked
him
a
question,
but
he
must
not
have
liked
the
answer,
because
he
smashed
him
across
the
face
with
the
butt
of
his
spear
and
knocked
him
down.
The
one
who’d
captured
him
gave
him
a
kick,
while
the
second
spearman
was
trying
on
the
bull’s-head
helm.
Finally
they
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
marched
him
off
toward
the
storehouse.
When
they
opened
the
heavy
wooden
doors,
a
small
boy
darted
out,
but
one
of
the
guards
grabbed
his
arm
and
flung
him
back
inside.
Arya
heard
sobbing
from
inside
the
building,
and
then
a
shriek
so
loud
and
full
of
pain
that
it
made
her
bite
her
lip.

The
guards
shoved
Gendry
inside
with
the
boy
and
barred
the
doors
behind
them.
Just
then,
a
breath
of
wind
came
sighing
off
the
lake,
and
the
banners
stirred
and
lifted.
The
one
on
the
tall
staff
bore
the
golden
lion,
as
she’d
feared.
On
the
other,
three
sleek
black
shapes
ran
across
a
field
as
yellow
as
butter.
Dogs,
she
thought.
Arya
had
seen
those
dogs
before,
but
where?

It
didn’t
matter.
The
only
thing
that
mattered
was
that
they
had
Gendry.
Even
if
he
was
stubborn
and
stupid,
she
had
to
get
him
out.
She
wondered
if
they
knew
that
the
queen
wanted
him.

One
of
the
guards
took
off
his
helm
and
donned
Gendry’s
instead.
It
made
her
angry
to
see
him
wearing
it,
but
she
knew
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
to
stop
him.
She
thought
she
heard
more
screams
from
inside
the
windowless
storehouse,
muffled
by
the
masonry,
but
it
was
hard
to
be
certain.

She
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
guard
changed,
and
much
more
besides.
Men
came
and
went.
They
led
their
horses
down
to
the
stream
to
drink.
A
hunting
party
returned
from
the
wood,
carrying
a
deer’s
carcass
slung
from
a
pole.
She
watched
them
clean
and
gut
it
and
build
a
cookfire
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream,
and
the
smell
of
cooking
meat
mingled
queerly
with
the
stench
of
corruption.
Her
empty
belly
roiled
and
she
thought
she
might
retch.
The
prospect
of
food
brought
other
men
out
of
the
houses,
near
all
of
them
wearing
bits
of
mail
or
boiled
leather.
When
the
deer
was
cooked,
the
choicest
portions
were
carried
to
one
of
the
houses.

She
thought
that
the
dark
might
let
her
crawl
close
and
free
Gendry,
but
the
guards
kindled
torches
off
the
cookfire.
A
squire
brought
meat
and
bread
to
the
two
guarding
the
storehouse,
and
later
two
more
men
joined
them
and
they
all
passed
a
skin
of
wine
from
hand
to
hand.
When
it
was
empty
the
others
left,
but
the
two
guards
remained,
leaning
on
their
spears.

Arya’s
arms
and
legs
were
stiff
when
she
finally
wriggled
out
from
under
the
briar
into
the
dark
of
the
wood.
It
was
a
black
night,
with
a
thin
sliver
of
moon
appearing
and
disappearing
as
the
clouds
blew
past.
Silent
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself
as
she
moved
through
the
trees.
In
this
darkness
she
dared
not
run,
for
fear
of
tripping
on
some
unseen
root
or
losing
her
way.
On
her
left
Gods
Eye
lapped
calmly
against
its
shores.
on
her
right
a
wind
sighed
through
the
branches,
and
leaves
rustled
and
stirred.
Far
off,
she
heard
the
howling
of
wolves.

Lommy
and
Hot
Pie
almost
shit
themselves
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
trees
behind
them.
“Quiet,”
she
told
them,
putting
an
arm
around
Weasel
when
the
little
girl
came
running
up.

Hot
Pie
stared
at
her
with
big
eyes.
“We
thought
you
left
us.”
He
had
his
shortsword
in
hand,
the
one
Yoren
had
taken
off
the
gold
cloak.
“I
was
scared
you
was
a
wolf.”

“Where’s
the
Bull?”
asked
Lommy.

“They
caught
him,”
Arya
whispered.
“We
have
to
get
him
out.
Hot
Pie,
you
got
to
help.
We’ll
sneak
up
and
kill
the
guards,
and
then
I’ll
open
the
door.”

Hot
Pie
and
Lommy
exchanged
a
look.
“How
many?”

“I
couldn’t
count,”
Arya
admitted.
“Twenty
at
least,
but
only
two
on
the
door.”

Hot
Pie
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
cry.
“We
can’t
fight
twenty.”

“You
only
need
to
fight
one.
I’ll
do
the
other
and
we’ll
get
Gendry
out
and
run.”

“We
should
yield,”
Lommy
said.
“Just
go
in
and
yield.”

Arya
shook
her
head
stubbornly.

“Then
just
leave
him,
Arry,”
Lommy
pleaded.
“They
don’t
know
about
the
rest
of
us.
If
we
hide,
they’ll
go
away,
you
know
they
will.
It’s
not
our
fault
Gendry’s
captured.”

“You’re
stupid,
Lommy,”
Arya
said
angrily.
“You’ll
die
if
we
don’t
get
Gendry
out.
Who’s
going
to
carry
you?”

“You
and
Hot
Pie.”

“All
the
time,
with
no
one
else
to
help?
We’ll
never
do
it.
Gendry
was
the
strong
one.
Anyhow,
I
don’t
care
what
you
say,
I’m
going
back
for
him.”
She
looked
at
Hot
Pie.
“Are
you
coming?”

Hot
Pie
glanced
at
Lommy,
at
Arya,
at
Lommy
again.
“I’ll
come,”
he
said
reluctantly.

“Lommy,
you
keep
Weasel
here.”

He
grabbed
the
little
girl
by
the
hand
and
pulled
her
close.
“What
if
the
wolves
come?”

“Yield,”
Arya
suggested.

Finding
their
way
back
to
the
village
seemed
to
take
hours.
Hot
Pie
kept
stumbling
in
the
dark
and
losing
his
way,
and
Arya
had
to
wait
for
him
and
double
back.
Finally
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
along
through
the
trees.
“Just
be
quiet
and
follow.”
When
they
could
make
out
the
first
faint
glow
of
the
village
fires
against
the
sky,
she
said,
“There’s
dead
men
hanging
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge,
but
they’re
nothing
to
be
scared
of,
just
remember
fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
We
have
to
go
real
quiet
and
slow.”
Hot
Pie
nodded.

She
wriggled
under
the
briar
first
and
waited
for
him
on
the
far
side,
crouched
low.
Hot
Pie
emerged
pale
and
panting,
face
and
arms
bloody
with
long
scratches.
He
started
to
say
something,
but
Arya
put
a
finger
to
his
lips.
On
hands
and
knees,
they
crawled
along
the
gibbet,
beneath
the
swaying
dead.
Hot
Pie
never
once
looked
up,
nor
made
a
sound.

Until
the
crow
landed
on
his
back,
and
he
gave
a
muffled
gasp.
“Who’s
there?”
a
voice
boomed
suddenly
from
the
dark.

Hot
Pie
leapt
to
his
feet.
“I
yield!”
He
threw
away
his
sword
as
dozens
of
crows
rose
shrieking
and
complaining
to
flap
about
the
corpses.
Arya
grabbed
his
leg
and
tried
to
drag
him
back
down,
but
he
wrenched
loose
and
ran
forward,
waving
his
arms.
“I
yield,
I
yield.”

She
bounced
up
and
drew
Needle,
but
by
then
men
were
all
around
her.
Arya
slashed
at
the
nearest,
but
he
blocked
her
with
a
steel-clad
arm,
and
someone
else
slammed
into
her
and
dragged
her
to
the
ground,
and
a
third
man
wrenched
the
sword
from
her
grasp.
When
she
tried
to
bite,
her
teeth
snapped
shut
on
cold
dirty
chainmail.
“Oho,
a
fierce
one,”
the
man
said,
laughing.
The
blow
from
his
iron-clad
fist
near
knocked
her
head
off.

They
talked
over
her
as
she
lay
hurting,
but
Arya
could
not
seem
to
understand
the
words.
Her
ears
rang.
When
she
tried
to
crawl
off,
the
earth
moved
beneath
her.
They
took
Needle.
The
shame
of
that
hurt
worse
than
the
pain,
and
the
pain
hurt
a
lot.
Jon
had
given
her
that
sword.
Syrio
had
taught
her
to
use
it.

Finally
someone
grabbed
the
front
of
her
jerkin,
yanked
her
to
her
knees.
Hot
Pie
was
kneeling
too,
before
the
tallest
man
Arya
had
ever
seen,
a
monster
from
one
of
Old
Nan’s
stories.
She
never
saw
where
the
giant
had
come
from.
Three
black
dogs
raced
across
his
faded
yellow
surcoat,
and
his
face
looked
as
hard
as
if
it
had
been
cut
from
stone.
Suddenly
Arya
knew
where
she
had
seen
those
dogs
before.
The
night
of
the
tourney
at
King’s
Landing,
all
the
knights
had
hung
their
shields
outside
their
pavilions.
“That
one
belongs
to
the
Hound’s
brother,”
Sansa
had
confided
when
they
passed
the
black
dogs
on
the
yellow
field.
“He’s
even
bigger
than
Hodor,
you’ll
see.
They
call
him
the
Mountain
That
Rides.”

Arya
let
her
head
droop,
only
half
aware
of
what
was
going
on
around
her.
Hot
Pie
was
yielding
some
more.
The
Mountain
said,
“You’ll
lead
us
to
these
others,”
and
walked
off.
Next
she
was
stumbling
past
the
dead
men
on
their
gibbet,
while
Hot
Pie
told
their
captors
he’d
bake
them
pies
and
tarts
if
they
didn’t
hurt
him.
Four
men
went
with
them.
One
carried
a
torch,
one
a
longsword;
two
had
spears.

They
found
Lommy
where
they’d
left
him,
under
the
oak.
“I
yield,”
he
called
out
at
once
when
he
saw
them.
He’d
flung
away
his
own
spear
and
raised
his
hands,
splotchy
green
with
old
dye.
“I
yield.
Please.”

The
man
with
the
torch
searched
around
under
the
trees.
“Are
you
the
last?
Baker
boy
said
there
was
a
girl.”

“She
ran
off
when
she
heard
you
coming,”
Lommy
said.
“You
made
a
lot
of
noise.”
And
Arya
thought,
Run,
Weasel,
run
as
far
as
you
can,
run
and
hide
and
never
come
back.

“Tell
us
where
we
can
find
that
whoreson
Dondarrion,
and
there’ll
be
a
hot
meal
in
it
for
you.”

“Who?”
said
Lommy
blankly.

“I
told
you,
this
lot
don’t
know
no
more
than
those
cunts
in
the
village.
Waste
o’bloody
time.”

One
of
the
spearmen
drifted
over
to
Lommy.
“Something
wrong
with
your
leg,
boy?”

“It
got
hurt.”

“Can
you
walk?”
He
sounded
concerned.

“No,”
said
Lommy.
“You
got
to
carry
me.”

“Think
so?”
The
man
lifted
his
spear
casually
and
drove
the
point
through
the
boy’s
soft
throat.
Lommy
never
even
had
time
to
yield
again.
He
jerked
once,
and
that
was
all.
When
the
man
pulled
his
spear
loose,
blood
sprayed
out
in
a
dark
fountain.
“Carry
him,
he
says,”
he
muttered,
chuckling.





TYRION

They
had
warned
him
to
dress
warmly.
Tyrion
Lannister
took
them
at
their
word.
He
was
garbed
in
heavy
quilted
breeches
and
a
woolen
doublet,
and
over
it
all
he
had
thrown
the
shadowskin
cloak
he
had
acquired
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
The
cloak
was
absurdly
long,
made
for
a
man
twice
his
height.
When
he
was
not
ahorse,
the
only
way
to
wear
the
thing
was
to
wrap
it
around
him
several
times,
which
made
him
look
like
a
ball
of
striped
fur.

Even
so,
he
was
glad
he
had
listened.
The
chill
in
the
long
dank
vault
went
bone
deep.
Timett
had
chosen
to
retreat
back
up
to
the
cellar
after
a
brief
taste
of
the
cold
below.
They
were
somewhere
under
the
hill
of
Rhaenys,
behind
the
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists.
The
damp
stone
walls
were
splotchy
with
nitre,
and
the
only
light
came
from
the
sealed
iron-and-glass
oil
lamp
that
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
carried
so
gingerly.

Gingerly
indeed…
and
these
would
be
the
ginger
jars.
Tyrion
lifted
one
for
inspection.
It
was
round
and
ruddy,
a
fat
clay
grapefruit.
A
little
big
for
his
hand,
but
it
would
fit
comfortably
in
the
grip
of
a
normal
man,
he
knew.
The
pottery
was
thin,
so
fragile
that
even
he
had
been
warned
not
to
squeeze
too
tightly,
lest
he
crush
it
in
his
fist.
The
clay
felt
roughened,
pebbled.
Hallyne
told
him
that
was
intentional.
“A
smooth
pot
is
more
apt
to
slip
from
a
man’s
grasp.”

The
wildfire
oozed
slowly
toward
the
lip
of
the
jar
when
Tyrion
tilted
it
to
peer
inside.
The
color
would
be
a
murky
green,
he
knew,
but
the
poor
light
made
that
impossible
to
confirm.
“Thick,”
he
observed.

“That
is
from
the
cold,
my
lord,”
said
Hallyne,
a
pallid
man
with
soft
damp
hands
and
an
obsequious
manner.
He
was
dressed
in
striped
black-and-scarlet
robes
trimmed
with
sable,
but
the
fur
looked
more
than
a
little
patchy
and
moth-eaten.
“As
it
warms,
the
substance
will
flow
more
easily,
like
lamp
oil.”

The
substance
was
the
pyromancers’
own
term
for
wildfire.
They
called
each
other
wisdom
as
well,
which
Tyrion
found
almost
as
annoying
as
their
custom
of
hinting
at
the
vast
secret
stores
of
knowledge
that
they
wanted
him
to
think
they
possessed.
Once
theirs
had
been
a
powerful
guild,
but
in
recent
centuries
the
maesters
of
the
Citadel
had
supplanted
the
alchemists
almost
everywhere.
Now
only
a
few
of
the
older
order
remained,
and
they
no
longer
even
pretended
to
transmute
metals…

…but
they
could
make
wildfire.
“Water
will
not
quench
it,
I
am
told.”

“That
is
so.
Once
it
takes
fire,
the
substance
will
burn
fiercely
until
it
is
no
more.
More,
it
will
seep
into
cloth,
wood,
leather,
even
steel,
so
they
take
fire
as
well.”

Tyrion
remembered
the
red
priest
Thoros
of
Myr
and
his
flaming
sword.
Even
a
thin
coating
of
wildfire
could
burn
for
an
hour.
Thoros
always
needed
a
new
sword
after
a
melee,
but
Robert
had
been
fond
of
the
man
and
ever
glad
to
provide
one.
“Why
doesn’t
it
seep
into
the
clay
as
well?”

“Oh,
but
it
does,”
said
Hallyne.
“There
is
a
vault
below
this
one
where
we
store
the
older
pots.
Those
from
King
Aerys’s
day.
It
was
his
fancy
to
have
the
jars
made
in
the
shapes
of
fruits.
Very
perilous
fruits
indeed,
my
lord
Hand,
and,
hmmm,
riper
now
than
ever,
if
you
take
my
meaning.
We
have
sealed
them
with
wax
and
pumped
the
lower
vault
full
of
water,
but
even
so…
by
rights
they
ought
to
have
been
destroyed,
but
so
many
of
our
masters
were
murdered
during
the
Sack
of
King’s
Landing,
the
few
acolytes
who
remained
were
unequal
to
the
task.
And
much
of
the
stock
we
made
for
Aerys
was
lost.
Only
last
year,
two
hundred
jars
were
discovered
in
a
storeroom
beneath
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
No
one
could
recall
how
they
came
there,
but
I’m
sure
I
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
the
High
Septon
was
beside
himself
with
terror.
I
myself
saw
that
they
were
safely
moved.
I
had
a
cart
filled
with
sand,
and
sent
our
most
able
acolytes.
We
worked
only
by
night,
we—”

“—did
a
splendid
job,
I
have
no
doubt.”
Tyrion
placed
the
jar
he’d
been
holding
back
among
its
fellows.
They
covered
the
table,
standing
in
orderly
rows
of
four
and
marching
away
into
the
subterranean
dimness.
And
there
were
other
tables
beyond,
many
other
tables.
“These,
ah,
fruits
of
the
late
King
Aerys,
can
they
still
be
used?”

“Oh,
yes,
most
certainly…
but
carefully,
my
lord,
ever
so
carefully.
As
it
ages,
the
substance
grows
ever
more,
hmmmm,
fickle,
let
us
say.
Any
flame
will
set
it
afire.
Any
spark.
Too
much
heat
and
jars
will
blaze
up
of
their
own
accord.
It
is
not
wise
to
let
them
sit
in
sunlight,
even
for
a
short
time.
Once
the
fire
begins
within,
the
heat
causes
the
substance
to
expand
violently,
and
the
jars
shortly
fly
to
pieces.
If
other
jars
should
happen
to
be
stored
in
the
same
vicinity,
those
go
up
as
well,
and
so—”

“How
many
jars
do
you
have
at
present?”

“This
morning
the
Wisdom
Munciter
told
me
that
we
had
seven
thousand
eight
hundred
and
forty.
That
count
includes
four
thousand
jars
from
King
Aerys’s
day,
to
be
sure.”

“Our
overripe
fruits?”

Hallyne
bobbed
his
head.
“Wisdom
Malliard
believes
we
shall
be
able
to
provide
a
full
ten
thousand
jars,
as
was
promised
the
queen.
I
concur.”
The
pyromancer
looked
indecently
pleased
with
that
prospect.

Assuming
our
enemies
give
you
the
time.
The
pyromancers
kept
their
recipe
for
wildfire
a
closely
guarded
secret,
but
Tyrion
knew
that
it
was
a
lengthy,
dangerous,
and
time-consuming
process.
He
had
assumed
the
promise
of
ten
thousand
jars
was
a
wild
boast,
like
that
of
the
bannerman
who
vows
to
marshal
ten
thousand
swords
for
his
lord
and
shows
up
on
the
day
of
battle
with
a
hundred
and
two.
If
they
can
truly
give
us
ten
thousand…

He
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
be
delighted
or
terrified.
Perhaps
a
smidge
of
both.
“I
trust
that
your
guild
brothers
are
not
engaging
in
any
unseemly
haste,
Wisdom.
We
do
not
want
ten
thousand
jars
of
defective
wildfire,
nor
even
one…
and
we
most
certainly
do
not
want
any
mishaps.”

“There
will
be
no
mishaps,
my
lord
Hand.
The
substance
is
prepared
by
trained
acolytes
in
a
series
of
bare
stone
cells,
and
each
jar
is
removed
by
an
apprentice
and
carried
down
here
the
instant
it
is
ready.
Above
each
work
cell
is
a
room
filled
entirely
with
sand.
A
protective
spell
has
been
laid
on
the
floors,
hmmm,
most
powerful.
Any
fire
in
the
cell
below
causes
the
floors
to
fall
away,
and
the
sand
smothers
the
blaze
at
once.”

“Not
to
mention
the
careless
acolyte.”
By
spell
Tyrion
imagined
Hallyne
meant
clever
trick.
He
thought
he
would
like
to
inspect
one
of
these
false-ceilinged
cells
to
see
how
it
worked,
but
this
was
not
the
time.
Perhaps
when
the
war
was
won.

“My
brethren
are
never
careless,”
Hallyne
insisted.
“If
I
may
be,
hmmmm,
frank…”

“Oh,
do.”

“The
substance
flows
through
my
veins,
and
lives
in
the
heart
of
every
pyromancer.
We
respect
its
power.
But
the
common
soldier,
hmmmm,
the
crew
of
one
of
the
queen’s
spitfires,
say,
in
the
unthinking
frenzy
of
battle…
any
little
mistake
can
bring
catastrophe.
That
cannot
be
said
too
often.
My
father
often
told
King
Aerys
as
much,
as
his
father
told
old
King
Jaehaerys.”

“They
must
have
listened,”
Tyrion
said.
“If
they
had
burned
the
city
down,
someone
would
have
told
me.
So
your
counsel
is
that
we
had
best
be
careful?
“

“Be
very
careful,”
said
Hallyne.
“Be
very
very
careful.”

“These
clay
jars…
do
you
have
an
ample
supply?”

“We
do,
my
lord,
and
thank
you
for
asking.”

“You
won’t
mind
if
I
take
some,
then.
A
few
thousand.”

“A
few
thousand?”

“Or
however
many
your
guild
can
spare,
without
interfering
with
production.
It’s
empty
pots
I’m
asking
for,
understand.
Have
them
sent
round
to
the
captains
on
each
of
the
city
gates.”

“I
will,
my
lord,
but
why…?”

Tyrion
smiled
up
at
him.
“When
you
tell
me
to
dress
warmly,
I
dress
warmly.
When
you
tell
me
to
be
careful,
well…”
He
gave
a
shrug.
“I’ve
seen
enough.
Perhaps
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
escort
me
back
up
to
my
litter?”

“It
would
be
my
great,
hmmm,
pleasure,
my
lord.”
Hallyne
lifted
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
stairs.
“It
was
good
of
you
to
visit
us.
A
great
honor,
hmmm.
It
has
been
too
long
since
the
King’s
Hand
graced
us
with
his
presence.
Not
since
Lord
Rossart,
and
he
was
of
our
order.
That
was
back
in
King
Aerys’s
day.
King
Aerys
took
a
great
interest
in
our
work.”

King
Aerys
used
you
to
roast
the
flesh
off
his
enemies.
His
brother
Jaime
had
told
him
a
few
stories
of
the
Mad
King
and
his
pet
pyromancers.
“Joffrey
will
be
interested
as
well,
I
have
no
doubt.”
Which
is
why
I’d
best
keep
him
well
away
from
you.

“It
is
our
great
hope
to
have
the
king
visit
our
Guildhall
in
his
own
royal
person.
I
have
spoken
of
it
to
your
royal
sister.
A
great
feast…”

It
was
growing
warmer
as
they
climbed.
“His
Grace
has
prohibited
all
feasting
until
such
time
as
the
war
is
won.”
At
my
insistence.
“The
king
does
not
think
it
fitting
to
banquet
on
choice
food
while
his
people
go
without
bread.”

“A
most,
hmmm,
loving
gesture,
my
lord.
Perhaps
instead
some
few
of
us
might
call
upon
the
king
at
the
Red
Keep.
A
small
demonstration
of
our
powers,
as
it
were,
to
distract
His
Grace
from
his
many
cares
for
an
evening.
Wildfire
is
but
one
of
the
dread
secrets
of
our
ancient
order.
Many
and
wondrous
are
the
things
we
might
show
you.”

“I
will
take
it
up
with
my
sister.”
Tyrion
had
no
objection
to
a
few
magic
tricks,
but
Joff’s
fondness
for
making
men
fight
to
the
death
was
trial
enough;
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
the
boy
to
taste
the
possibilities
of
burning
them
alive.

When
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
steps,
Tyrion
shrugged
out
of
his
shadowskin
fur
and
folded
it
over
his
arm.
The
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists
was
an
imposing
warren
of
black
stone,
but
Hallyne
led
him
through
the
twists
and
turns
until
they
reached
the
Gallery
of
the
Iron
Torches,
a
long
echoing
chamber
where
columns
of
green
fire
danced
around
black
metal
columns
twenty
feet
tall.
Ghostly
flames
shimmered
off
the
polished
black
marble
of
the
walls
and
floor
and
bathed
the
hall
in
an
emerald
radiance.
Tyrion
would
have
been
more
impressed
if
he
hadn’t
known
that
the
great
iron
torches
had
only
been
lit
this
morning
in
honor
of
his
visit,
and
would
be
extinguished
the
instant
the
doors
closed
behind
him.
Wildfire
was
too
costly
to
squander.

They
emerged
atop
the
broad
curving
steps
that
fronted
on
the
Street
of
the
Sisters,
near
the
foot
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
He
bid
Hallyne
farewell
and
waddled
down
to
where
Timett
son
of
Timett
waited
with
an
escort
of
Burned
Men.
Given
his
purpose
today,
it
had
seemed
a
singularly
appropriate
choice
for
his
guard.
Besides,
their
scars
struck
terror
in
the
hearts
of
the
city
rabble.
That
was
all
to
the
good
these
days.
Only
three
nights
past,
another
mob
had
gathered
at
the
gates
of
the
Red
Keep,
chanting
for
food.
Joff
had
unleashed
a
storm
of
arrows
against
them,
slaying
four,
and
then
shouted
down
that
they
had
his
leave
to
eat
their
dead.
Winning
us
still
more
friends.

Tyrion
was
surprised
to
see
Bronn
standing
beside
the
litter
as
well.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”

“Delivering
your
messages,”
Bronn
said.
“Ironhand
wants
you
urgently
at
the
Gate
of
the
Gods.
He
won’t
say
why.
And
you’ve
been
summoned
to
Maegor’s
too.”

“Summoned?”
Tyrion
knew
of
only
one
person
who
would
presume
to
use
that
word.
“And
what
does
Cersei
want
of
me?”

Bronn
shrugged.
“The
queen
commands
you
to
return
to
the
castle
at
once
and
attend
her
in
her
chambers.
That
stripling
cousin
of
yours
delivered
the
message.
Four
hairs
on
his
lip
and
he
thinks
he’s
a
man.”

“Four
hairs
and
a
knighthood.
He’s
Ser
Lancel
now,
never
forget.”
Tyrion
knew
that
Ser
Jacelyn
would
not
send
for
him
unless
the
matter
was
of
import.
“I’d
best
see
what
Bywater
wants.
Inform
my
sister
that
I
will
attend
her
on
my
return.”

“She
won’t
like
that,”
Bronn
warned.

“Good.
The
longer
Cersei
waits,
the
angrier
she’ll
become,
and
anger
makes
her
stupid.
I
much
prefer
angry
and
stupid
to
composed
and
cunning.”
Tyrion
tossed
his
folded
cloak
into
his
litter,
and
Timett
helped
him
up
after
it.

The
market
square
inside
the
Gate
of
the
Gods,
which
in
normal
times
would
have
been
thronged
with
farmers
selling
vegetables,
was
near
deserted
when
Tyrion
crossed
it.
Ser
Jacelyn
met
him
at
the
gate,
and
raised
his
iron
hand
in
brusque
salute.
“My
lord.
Your
cousin
Cleos
Frey
is
here,
come
from
Riverrun
under
a
peace
banner
with
a
letter
from
Robb
Stark.”

“Peace
terms?”

“So
he
says.”

“Sweet
cousin.
Show
me
to
him.”

The
gold
cloaks
had
confined
Ser
Cleos
to
a
windowless
guardroom
in
the
gatehouse.
He
rose
when
they
entered.
“Tyrion,
you
are
a
most
welcome
sight.”

“That’s
not
something
I
hear
often,
cousin.”

“Has
Cersei
come
with
you?”

“My
sister
is
otherwise
occupied.
Is
this
Stark’s
letter?”
He
plucked
it
off
the
table.
“Ser
Jacelyn,
you
may
leave
us.”

Bywater
bowed
and
departed.
“I
was
asked
to
bring
the
offer
to
the
Queen
Regent,”
Ser
Cleos
said
as
the
door
shut.

“I
shall.”
Tyrion
glanced
over
the
map
that
Robb
Stark
had
sent
with
his
letter.
“All
in
good
time,
cousin.
Sit.
Rest.
You
look
gaunt
and
haggard.”
He
looked
worse
than
that,
in
truth.

“Yes.”
Ser
Cleos
lowered
himself
onto
a
bench.
“It
is
bad
in
the
riverlands,
Tyrion.
Around
the
Gods
Eye
and
along
the
kingsroad
especially.
The
river
lords
are
burning
their
own
crops
to
try
and
starve
us,
and
your
father’s
foragers
are
torching
every
village
they
take
and
putting
the
smallfolk
to
the
sword.”

That
was
the
way
of
war.
The
smallfolk
were
slaughtered,
while
the
highborn
were
held
for
ransom.
Remind
me
to
thank
the
gods
that
I
was
bom
a
Lannister.

Ser
Cleos
ran
a
hand
through
his
thin
brown
hair.
“Even
with
a
peace
banner,
we
were
attacked
twice.
Wolves
in
mail,
hungry
to
savage
anyone
weaker
than
themselves.
The
gods
alone
know
what
side
they
started
on,
but
they’re
on
their
own
side
now.
Lost
three
men,
and
twice
as
many
wounded.”

“What
news
of
our
foe?”
Tyrion
turned
his
attention
back
to
Stark’s
terms.
The
boy
does
not
want
too
much.
Only
half
the
realm,
the
release
of
our
captives,
hostages,
his
father’s
sword…
oh,
yes,
and
his
sisters.

“The
boy
sits
idle
at
Riverrun,”
Ser
Cleos
said.
“I
think
he
fears
to
face
your
father
in
the
field.
His
strength
grows
less
each
day.
The
river
lords
have
departed,
each
to
defend
his
own
lands.”

Is
this
what
Father
intended?
Tyrion
rolled
up
Stark’s
map.
“These
terms
will
never
do.”

“Will
you
at
least
consent
to
trade
the
Stark
girls
for
Tion
and
Willem?”
Ser
Cleos
asked
plaintively.

Tion
Frey
was
his
younger
brother,
Tyrion
recalled.
“No,”
he
said
gently,
“but
we’ll
propose
our
own
exchange
of
captives.
Let
me
consult
with
Cersei
and
the
council.
We
shall
send
you
back
to
Riverrun
with
our
terms.”

Clearly,
the
prospect
did
not
cheer
him.
“My
lord,
I
do
not
believe
Robb
Stark
will
yield
easily.
It
is
Lady
Catelyn
who
wants
this
peace,
not
the
boy.”

“Lady
Catelyn
wants
her
daughters.”
Tyrion
pushed
himself
down
from
the
bench,
letter
and
map
in
hand.
“Ser
Jacelyn
will
see
that
you
have
food
and
fire.
You
look
in
dire
need
of
sleep,
cousin.
I
will
send
for
you
when
we
know
more.”

He
found
Ser
Jacelyn
on
the
ramparts,
watching
several
hundred
new
recruits
drilling
in
the
field
below.
With
so
many
seeking
refuge
in
King’s
Landing,
there
was
no
lack
of
men
willing
to
join
the
City
Watch
for
a
full
belly
and
a
bed
of
straw
in
the
barracks,
but
Tyrion
had
no
illusions
about
how
well
these
ragged
defenders
of
theirs
would
fight
if
it
came
to
battle.

“You
did
well
to
send
for
me,”
Tyrion
said.
“I
shall
leave
Ser
Cleos
in
your
hands.
He
is
to
have
every
hospitality.”

“And
his
escort?”
the
commander
wanted
to
know.

“Give
them
food
and
clean
garb,
and
find
a
maester
to
see
to
their
hurts.
They
are
not
to
set
foot
inside
the
city,
is
that
understood?”
It
would
never
do
to
have
the
truth
of
conditions
in
King’s
Landing
reach
Robb
Stark
in
Riverrun.

“Well
understood,
my
lord.”

“Oh,
and
one
more
thing.
The
alchemists
will
be
sending
a
large
supply
of
clay
pots
to
each
of
the
city
gates.
You’re
to
use
them
to
train
the
men
who
will
work
your
spitfires.
Fill
the
pots
with
green
paint
and
have
them
drill
at
loading
and
firing.
Any
man
who
spatters
should
be
replaced.
When
they
have
mastered
the
paint
pots,
substitute
lamp
oil
and
have
them
work
at
lighting
the
jars
and
firing
them
while
aflame.
Once
they
learn
to
do
that
without
burning
themselves,
they
may
be
ready
for
wildfire.”

Ser
Jacelyn
scratched
at
his
cheek
with
his
iron
hand.
“Wise
measures.
Though
I
have
no
love
for
that
alchemist’s
piss.”

“Nor
I,
but
I
use
what
I’m
given.”

Once
back
inside
his
litter,
Tyrion
Lannister
drew
the
curtains
and
plumped
a
cushion
under
his
elbow.
Cersei
would
be
displeased
to
learn
that
he
had
intercepted
Stark’s
letter,
but
his
father
had
sent
him
here
to
rule,
not
to
please
Cersei.

It
seemed
to
him
that
Robb
Stark
had
given
them
a
golden
chance.
Let
the
boy
wait
at
Riverrun
dreaming
of
an
easy
peace.
Tyrion
would
reply
with
terms
of
his
own,
giving
the
King
in
the
North
just
enough
of
what
he
wanted
to
keep
him
hopeful.
Let
Ser
Cleos
wear
out
his
bony
Frey
rump
riding
to
and
fro
with
offers
and
counters.
All
the
while,
their
cousin
Ser
Stafford
would
be
training
and
arming
the
new
host
he’d
raised
at
Casterly
Rock.
Once
he
was
ready,
he
and
Lord
Tywin
could
smash
the
Tullys
and
Starks
between
them.

Now
if
only
Robert’s
brothers
would
be
so
accommodating.
Glacial
as
his
progress
was,
still
Renly
Baratheon
crept
north
and
east
with
his
huge
southron
host,
and
scarcely
a
night
passed
that
Tyrion
did
not
dread
being
awakened
with
the
news
that
Lord
Stannis
was
sailing
his
fleet
up
the
Blackwater
Rush.
Well,
it
would
seem
I
have
a
goodly
stock
of
wildfire,
but
still…

The
sound
of
some
hubbub
in
the
street
intruded
on
his
worries.
Tyrion
peered
out
cautiously
between
the
curtains.
They
were
passing
through
Cobbler’s
Square,
where
a
sizable
crowd
had
gathered
beneath
the
leather
awnings
to
listen
to
the
rantings
of
a
prophet.
A
robe
of
undyed
wool
belted
with
a
hempen
rope
marked
him
for
one
of
the
begging
brothers.

“Corruption!”
the
man
cried
shrilly.
“There
is
the
warning!
Behold
the
Father’s
scourge!”
He
pointed
at
the
fuzzy
red
wound
in
the
sky.
From
this
vantage,
the
distant
castle
on
Aegon’s
High
Hill
was
directly
behind
him,
with
the
comet
hanging
forebodingly
over
its
towers.
A
clever
choice
of
stage,
Tyrion
reflected.
“We
have
become
swollen,
bloated,
foul.
Brother
couples
with
sister
in
the
bed
of
kings,
and
the
fruit
of
their
incest
capers
in
his
palace
to
the
piping
of
a
twisted
little
monkey
demon.
Highborn
ladies
fornicate
with
fools
and
give
birth
to
monsters!
Even
the
High
Septon
has
forgotten
the
gods!
He
bathes
in
scented
waters
and
grows
fat
on
lark
and
lamprey
while
his
people
starve!
Pride
comes
before
prayer,
maggots
rule
our
castles,
and
gold
is
all…
but
no
more!
The
Rotten
Summer
is
at
an
end,
and
the
Whoremonger
King
is
brought
low!
When
the
boar
did
open
him,
a
great
stench
rose
to
heaven
and
a
thousand
snakes
slid
forth
from
his
belly,
hissing
and
biting!”
He
jabbed
his
bony
finger
back
at
comet
and
castle.
“There
comes
the
Harbinger!
Cleanse
yourselves,
the
gods
cry
out,
lest
ye
be
cleansed!
Bathe
in
the
wine
of
righteousness,
or
you
shall
be
bathed
in
fire!
Fire!”

“Fire!”
other
voices
echoed,
but
the
hoots
of
derision
almost
drowned
them
out.
Tyrion
took
solace
from
that.
He
gave
the
command
to
continue,
and
the
litter
rocked
like
a
ship
on
a
rough
sea
as
the
Burned
Men
cleared
a
path.
Twisted
little
monkey
demon
indeed.
The
wretch
did
have
a
point
about
the
High
Septon,
to
be
sure.
What
was
it
that
Moon
Boy
had
said
of
him
the
other
day?
A
pious
man
who
worships
the
Seven
so
fervently
that
he
eats
a
meal
for
each
of
them
whenever
he
sits
to
table.
The
memory
of
the
fool’s
jape
made
Tyrion
smile.

He
was
pleased
to
reach
the
Red
Keep
without
further
incident.
As
he
climbed
the
steps
to
his
chambers,
Tyrion
felt
a
deal
more
hopeful
than
he
had
at
dawn.
Time,
that’s
all
I
truly
need,
time
to
piece
it
all
together.
Once
the
chain
is
done…
He
opened
the
door
to
his
solar.

Cersei
turned
away
from
the
window,
her
skirts
swirling
around
her
slender
hips.
“How
dare
you
ignore
my
summons!”

“Who
admitted
you
to
my
tower?”

“Your
tower?
This
is
my
son’s
royal
castle.”

“So
they
tell
me.”
Tyrion
was
not
amused.
Crawn
would
be
even
less
so;
his
Moon
Brothers
had
the
guard
today.
“I
was
about
to
come
to
you,
as
it
happens.”

“Were
you?”

He
swung
the
door
shut
behind
him.
“You
doubt
me?”

“Always,
and
with
good
reason.”

“I’m
hurt.”
Tyrion
waddled
to
the
sideboard
for
a
cup
of
wine.
He
knew
no
surer
way
to
work
up
a
thirst
than
talking
with
Cersei.
“If
I’ve
given
you
offense,
I
would
know
how.”

“What
a
disgusting
little
worm
you
are.
Myrcella
is
my
only
daughter.
Did
you
truly
imagine
that
I
would
allow
you
to
sell
her
like
a
bag
of
oats?
“

Myrcella,
he
thought.
Well,
that
egg
has
hatched.
Let’s
see
what
color
the
chick
is.
“Hardly
a
bag
of
oats.
Myrcella
is
a
princess.
Some
would
say
this
is
what
she
was
born
for.
Or
did
you
plan
to
marry
her
to
Tommen?”

Her
hand
lashed
out,
knocking
the
wine
cup
from
his
hand
to
spill
on
the
floor.
“Brother
or
no,
I
should
have
your
tongue
out
for
that.
I
am
Joffrey’s
regent,
not
you,
and
I
say
that
Myrcella
will
not
be
shipped
off
to
this
Dornishman
the
way
I
was
shipped
to
Robert
Baratheon.”

Tyrion
shook
wine
off
his
fingers
and
sighed.
“Why
not?
She’d
be
a
deal
safer
in
Dorne
than
she
is
here.”

“Are
you
utterly
ignorant
or
simply
perverse?
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
the
Martells
have
no
cause
to
love
us.”

“The
Martells
have
every
cause
to
hate
us.
Nonetheless,
I
expect
them
to
agree.
Prince
Doran’s
grievance
against
House
Lannister
goes
back
only
a
generation,
but
the
Dornishmen
have
warred
against
Storm’s
End
and
Highgarden
for
a
thousand
years,
and
Renly
has
taken
Dorne’s
allegiance
for
granted.
Myrcella
is
nine,
Trystane
Martell
eleven.
I
have
proposed
they
wed
when
she
reaches
her
fourteenth
year.
Until
such
time,
she
would
be
an
honored
guest
at
Sunspear,
under
Prince
Doran’s
protection.”

“A
hostage,”
Cersei
said,
mouth
tightening.

“An
honored
guest,”
Tyrion
insisted,
“and
I
suspect
Martell
will
treat
Myrcella
more
kindly
than
Joffrey
has
treated
Sansa
Stark.
I
had
in
mind
to
send
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
with
her.
With
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
as
her
sworn
shield,
no
one
is
like
to
forget
who
or
what
she
is.”

“Small
good
Ser
Arys
will
do
her
if
Doran
Martell
decides
that
my
daughter’s
death
would
wash
out
his
sister’s.”

“Martell
is
too
honorable
to
murder
a
nine-year-old
girl,
particularly
one
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
Myrcella.
So
long
as
he
holds
her
he
can
be
reasonably
certain
that
we’ll
keep
faith
on
our
side,
and
the
terms
are
too
rich
to
refuse.
Myrcella
is
the
least
part
of
it.
I’ve
also
offered
him
his
sister’s
killer,
a
council
seat,
some
castles
on
the
Marches…”

“Too
much.”
Cersei
paced
away
from
him,
restless
as
a
lioness,
skirts
swirling.
“You’ve
offered
too
much,
and
without
my
authority
or
consent.”

“This
is
the
Prince
of
Dorne
we
are
speaking
of.
If
I’d
offered
less,
he’d
likely
spit
in
my
face.”

“Too
much!”
Cersei
insisted,
whirling
back.

“What
would
you
have
offered
him,
that
hole
between
your
legs?”
Tyrion
said,
his
own
anger
flaring.

This
time
he
saw
the
slap
coming.
His
head
snapped
around
with
a
crack.
“Sweet
sweet
sister,”
he
said,
“I
promise
you,
that
was
the
last
time
you
will
ever
strike
me.”

His
sister
laughed.
“Don’t
threaten
me,
little
man.
Do
you
think
Father’s
letter
keeps
you
safe?
A
piece
of
paper.
Eddard
Stark
had
a
piece
of
paper
too,
for
all
the
good
it
did
him.”

Eddard
Stark
did
not
have
the
City
Watch,
Tyrion
thought,
nor
my
clansmen,
nor
the
sellswords
that
Bronn
has
hired.
I
do.
Or
so
he
hoped.
Trusting
in
Varys,
in
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater,
in
Bronn.
Lord
Stark
had
probably
had
his
delusions
as
well.

Yet
he
said
nothing.
A
wise
man
did
not
pour
wildfire
on
a
brazier.
Instead
he
poured
a
fresh
cup
of
wine.
“How
safe
do
you
think
Myrcella
will
be
if
King’s
Landing
falls?
Renly
and
Stannis
will
mount
her
head
beside
yours.”

And
Cersei
began
to
cry.

Tyrion
Lannister
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
if
Aegon
the
Conqueror
himself
had
burst
into
the
room,
riding
on
a
dragon
and
juggling
lemon
pies.
He
had
not
seen
his
sister
weep
since
they
were
children
together
at
Casterly
Rock.
Awkwardly,
he
took
a
step
toward
her.
When
your
sister
cries,
you
were
supposed
to
comfort
her…
but
this
was
Cersei!
He
reached
a
tentative
hand
for
her
shoulder.

“Don’t
touch
me,”
she
said,
wrenching
away.
It
should
not
have
hurt,
yet
it
did,
more
than
any
slap.
Red-faced,
as
angry
as
she
was
grief-stricken,
Cersei
struggled
for
breath.
“Don’t
look
at
me,
not…
not
like
this…
not
you.”

Politely,
Tyrion
turned
his
back.
“I
did
not
mean
to
frighten
you.
I
promise
you,
nothing
will
happen
to
Myrcella.”

“Liar,”
she
said
behind
him.
“I’m
not
a
child,
to
be
soothed
with
empty
promises.
You
told
me
you
would
free
Jaime
too.
Well,
where
is
he?
“

“In
Riverrun,
I
should
imagine.
Safe
and
under
guard,
until
I
find
a
way
to
free
him.”

Cersei
sniffed.
“I
should
have
been
born
a
man.
I
would
have
no
need
of
any
of
you
then.
None
of
this
would
have
been
allowed
to
happen.
How
could
Jaime
let
himself
be
captured
by
that
boy?
And
Father,
I
trusted
in
him,
fool
that
I
am,
but
where
is
he
now
that
he’s
wanted?
What
is
he
doing?”

“Making
war.”

“From
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal?”
she
said
scornfully.
“A
curious
way
of
fighting.
It
looks
suspiciously
like
hiding.”

“Look
again.”

“What
else
would
you
call
it?
Father
sits
in
one
castle,
and
Robb
Stark
sits
in
another,
and
no
one
does
anything.”

“There
is
sitting
and
there
is
sitting,”
Tyrion
suggested.
“Each
one
waits
for
the
other
to
move,
but
the
lion
is
still,
poised,
his
tail
twitching,
while
the
fawn
is
frozen
by
fear,
bowels
turned
to
jelly.
No
matter
which
way
he
bounds,
the
lion
will
have
him,
and
he
knows
it.”

“And
you’re
quite
certain
that
Father
is
the
lion?”

Tyrion
grinned.
“It’s
on
all
our
banners.”

She
ignored
the
jest.
“If
it
was
Father
who’d
been
taken
captive,
Jaime
would
not
be
sitting
by
idly,
I
promise
you.”

Jaime
would
be
battering
his
host
to
bloody
bits
against
the
walls
of
Riverrun,
and
the
Others
take
their
chances.
He
never
did
have
any
patience,
no
more
than
you,
sweet
sister.
“Not
all
of
us
can
be
as
bold
as
Jaime,
but
there
are
other
ways
to
win
wars.
Harrenhal
is
strong
and
well
situated.”

“And
King’s
Landing
is
not,
as
we
both
know
perfectly
well.
While
Father
plays
lion
and
fawn
with
the
Stark
boy,
Renly
marches
up
the
roseroad.
He
could
be
at
our
gates
any
day
now!”

“The
city
will
not
fall
in
a
day.
From
Harrenhal
it
is
a
straight,
swift
march
down
the
kingsroad.
Renly
will
scarce
have
unlimbered
his
siege
engines
before
Father
takes
him
in
the
rear.
His
host
will
be
the
hammer,
the
city
walls
the
anvil.
it
makes
a
lovely
picture.”

Cersei’s
green
eyes
bored
into
him,
wary,
yet
hungry
for
the
reassurance
he
was
feeding
her.
“And
if
Robb
Stark
marches?”

“Harrenhal
is
close
enough
to
the
fords
of
the
Trident
so
that
Roose
Bolton
cannot
bring
the
northern
foot
across
to
join
with
the
Young
Wolf’s
horse.
Stark
cannot
march
on
King’s
Landing
without
taking
Harrenhal
first,
and
even
with
Bolton
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
do
that.”
Tyrion
tried
his
most
winning
smile.
“Meanwhile
Father
lives
off
the
fat
of
the
riverlands,
while
our
uncle
Stafford
gathers
fresh
levies
at
the
Rock.”

Cersei
regarded
him
suspiciously.
“How
could
you
know
all
this?
Did
Father
tell
you
his
intentions
when
he
sent
you
here?”

“No.
I
glanced
at
a
map.”

Her
look
turned
to
disdain.
“You’ve
conjured
up
every
word
of
this
in
that
grotesque
head
of
yours,
haven’t
you,
Imp?”

Tyrion
tsked.
“Sweet
sister,
I
ask
you,
if
we
weren’t
winning,
would
the
Starks
have
sued
for
peace?”
He
drew
out
the
letter
that
Ser
Cleos
Frey
had
brought.
“The
Young
Wolf
has
sent
us
terms,
you
see.
Unacceptable
terms,
to
be
sure,
but
still,
a
beginning.
Would
you
care
to
see
them?”

“Yes.”
That
fast,
she
was
all
queen
again.
“How
do
you
come
to
have
them?
They
should
have
come
to
me.”

“What
else
is
a
Hand
for,
if
not
to
hand
you
things?”
Tyrion
handed
her
the
letter.
His
cheek
still
throbbed
where
Cersei’s
hand
had
left
its
mark.
Let
her
flay
half
my
face,
it
will
be
a
small
price
to
pay
for
her
consent
to
the
Dornish
marriage.
He
would
have
that
now,
he
could
sense
it.

And
certain
knowledge
of
an
informer
too…
well,
that
was
the
plum
in
his
pudding.





BRAN

Dancer
was
draped
in
bardings
of
snowy
white
wool
emblazoned
with
the
grey
direwolf
of
House
Stark,
while
Bran
wore
grey
breeches
and
white
doublet,
his
sleeves
and
collar
trimmed
with
vair.
Over
his
heart
was
his
wolf’s-head
brooch
of
silver
and
polished
jet.
He
would
sooner
have
had
Summer
than
a
silver
wolf
on
his
breast,
but
Ser
Rodrik
had
been
unyielding.

The
low
stone
steps
balked
Dancer
only
for
a
moment.
When
Bran
urged
her
on,
she
took
them
easily.
Beyond
the
wide
oak-and-iron
doors,
eight
long
rows
of
trestle
tables
filled
Winterfell’s
Great
Hall,
four
on
each
side
of
the
center
aisle.
Men
crowded
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
benches.
“Stark!”
they
called
as
Bran
trotted
past,
rising
to
their
feet.
“Winterfell!
Winterfell!”

He
was
old
enough
to
know
that
it
was
not
truly
him
they
shouted
for—it
was
the
harvest
they
cheered,
it
was
Robb
and
his
victories,
it
was
his
lord
father
and
his
grandfather
and
all
the
Starks
going
back
eight
thousand
years.
Still,
it
made
him
swell
with
pride.
For
so
long
as
it
took
him
to
ride
the
length
of
that
hall
he
forgot
that
he
was
broken.
Yet
when
he
reached
the
dais,
with
every
eye
upon
him,
Osha
and
Hodor
undid
his
straps
and
buckles,
lifted
him
off
Dancer’s
back,
and
carried
him
to
the
high
seat
of
his
fathers.

Ser
Rodrik
was
seated
to
Bran’s
left,
his
daughter
Beth
beside
him.
Rickon
was
to
his
right,
his
mop
of
shaggy
auburn
hair
grown
so
long
that
it
brushed
his
ermine
mantle.
He
had
refused
to
let
anyone
cut
it
since
their
mother
had
gone.
The
last
girl
to
try
had
been
bitten
for
her
efforts.
“I
wanted
to
ride
too,”
he
said
as
Hodor
led
Dancer
away.
“I
ride
better
than
you.”

“You
don’t,
so
hush
up,”
he
told
his
brother.
Ser
Rodrik
bellowed
for
quiet.
Bran
raised
his
voice.
He
bid
them
welcome
in
the
name
of
his
brother,
the
King
in
the
North,
and
asked
them
to
thank
the
gods
old
and
new
for
Robb’s
victories
and
the
bounty
of
the
harvest.
“May
there
be
a
hundred
more,”
he
finished,
raising
his
father’s
silver
goblet.

“A
hundred
more!”
Pewter
tankards,
clay
cups,
and
iron-banded
drinking
horns
clashed
together.
Bran’s
wine
was
sweetened
with
honey
and
fragrant
with
cinnamon
and
cloves,
but
stronger
than
he
was
used
to.
He
could
feel
its
hot
snaky
fingers
wriggling
through
his
chest
as
he
swallowed.
By
the
time
he
set
down
the
goblet,
his
head
was
swimming.

“You
did
well,
Bran,”
Ser
Rodrik
told
him.
“Lord
Eddard
would
have
been
most
proud.”
Down
the
table,
Maester
Luwin
nodded
his
agreement
as
the
servers
began
to
carry
in
the
food.

Such
food
Bran
had
never
seen;
course
after
course
after
course,
so
much
that
he
could
not
manage
more
than
a
bite
or
two
of
each
dish.
There
were
great
joints
of
aurochs
roasted
with
leeks,
venison
pies
chunky
with
carrots,
bacon,
and
mushrooms,
mutton
chops
sauced
in
honey
and
cloves,
savory
duck,
peppered
boar,
goose,
skewers
of
pigeon
and
capon,
beef-and-barley
stew,
cold
fruit
soup.
Lord
Wyman
had
brought
twenty
casks
of
fish
from
White
Harbor
packed
in
salt
and
seaweed;
whitefish
and
winkles,
crabs
and
mussels,
clams,
herring,
cod,
salmon,
lobster
and
lampreys.
There
was
black
bread
and
honeycakes
and
oaten
biscuits;
there
were
turnips
and
pease
and
beets,
beans
and
squash
and
huge
red
onions;
there
were
baked
apples
and
berry
tarts
and
pears
poached
in
strongwine.
Wheels
of
white
cheese
were
set
at
every
table,
above
and
below
the
salt,
and
flagons
of
hot
spice
wine
and
chilled
autumn
ale
were
passed
up
and
down
the
tables.

Lord
Wyman’s
musicians
played
bravely
and
well,
but
harp
and
fiddle
and
horn
were
soon
drowned
beneath
a
tide
of
talk
and
laughter,
the
clash
of
cup
and
plate,
and
the
snarling
of
hounds
fighting
for
table
scraps.
The
singer
sang
good
songs,
“Iron
Lances”
and
“The
Burning
of
the
Ships”
and
“The
Bear
and
the
Maiden
Fair,”
but
only
Hodor
seemed
to
be
listening.
He
stood
beside
the
piper,
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other.

The
noise
swelled
to
a
steady
rumbling
roar,
a
great
heady
stew
of
sound.
Ser
Rodrik
talked
with
Maester
Luwin
above
Beth’s
curly
head,
while
Rickon
screamed
happily
at
the
Walders.
Bran
had
not
wanted
the
Freys
at
the
high
table,
but
the
maester
reminded
him
that
they
would
soon
be
kin.
Robb
was
to
marry
one
of
their
aunts,
and
Arya
one
of
their
uncles.
“She
never
will,”
Bran
said,
“not
Arya,”
but
Maester
Luwin
was
unyielding,
so
there
they
were
beside
Rickon.

The
serving
men
brought
every
dish
to
Bran
first,
that
he
might
take
the
lord’s
portion
if
he
chose.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
ducks,
he
could
eat
no
more.
After
that
he
nodded
approval
at
each
course
in
turn,
and
waved
it
away.
If
the
dish
smelled
especially
choice,
he
would
send
it
to
one
of
the
lords
on
the
dais,
a
gesture
of
friendship
and
favor
that
Maester
Luwin
told
him
he
must
make.
He
sent
some
salmon
down
to
poor
sad
Lady
Hornwood,
the
boar
to
the
boisterous
Umbers,
a
dish
of
goose-in-berries
to
Cley
Cerwyn,
and
a
huge
lobster
to
Joseth
the
master
of
horse,
who
was
neither
lord
nor
guest,
but
had
seen
to
Dancer’s
training
and
made
it
possible
for
Bran
to
ride.
He
sent
sweets
to
Hodor
and
Old
Nan
as
well,
for
no
reason
but
he
loved
them.
Ser
Rodrik
reminded
him
to
send
something
to
his
foster
brothers,
so
he
sent
Little
Walder
some
boiled
beets
and
Big
Walder
the
buttered
turnips.

On
the
benches
below,
Winterfell
men
mixed
with
smallfolk
from
the
winter
town,
friends
from
the
nearer
holdfasts,
and
the
escorts
of
their
lordly
guests.
Some
faces
Bran
had
never
seen
before,
others
he
knew
as
well
as
his
own,
yet
they
all
seemed
equally
foreign
to
him.
He
watched
them
as
from
a
distance,
as
if
he
still
sat
in
the
window
of
his
bedchamber
looking
down
on
the
yard
below,
seeing
everything
yet
a
part
of
nothing.

Osha
moved
among
the
tables,
pouring
ale.
One
of
Leobald
Tallhart’s
men
slid
a
hand
up
under
her
skirts
and
she
broke
the
flagon
over
his
head,
to
roars
of
laughter.
Yet
Mikken
had
his
hand
down
some
woman’s
bodice,
and
she
seemed
not
to
mind.
Bran
watched
Farlen
make
his
red
bitch
beg
for
bones
and
smiled
at
Old
Nan
plucking
at
the
crust
of
a
hot
pie
with
wrinkled
fingers.
On
the
dais,
Lord
Wyman
attacked
a
steaming
plate
of
lampreys
as
if
they
were
an
enemy
host.
He
was
so
fat
that
Ser
Rodrik
had
commanded
that
a
special
wide
chair
be
built
for
him
to
sit
in,
but
he
laughed
loud
and
often,
and
Bran
thought
he
liked
him.
Poor
wan
Lady
Hornwood
sat
beside
him,
her
face
a
stony
mask
as
she
picked
listlessly
at
her
food.
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
high
table,
Hothen
and
Mors
were
playing
a
drinking
game,
slamming
their
horns
together
as
hard
as
knights
meeting
in
joust.

It
is
too
hot
here,
and
too
noisy,
and
they
are
all
getting
drunk.
Bran
itched
under
his
grey
and
white
woolens,
and
suddenly
he
wished
he
were
anywhere
but
here.
It
is
cool
in
the
godswood
now.
Steam
is
rising
off
the
hot
pools,
and
the
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
are
rustling.
The
smells
are
richer
than
here,
and
before
long
the
moon
will
rise
and
my
brother
will
sing
to
it.

“Bran?”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“You
do
not
eat.”

The
waking
dream
had
been
so
vivid,
for
a
moment
Bran
had
not
known
where
he
was.
“I’ll
have
more
later,”
he
said.
“My
belly’s
full
to
bursting.”

The
old
knight’s
white
mustache
was
pink
with
wine.
“You
have
done
well,
Bran.
Here,
and
at
the
audiences.
You
will
be
an
especial
fine
lord
one
day,
I
think.”

I
want
to
be
a
knight.
Bran
took
another
sip
of
the
spiced
honey
wine
from
his
father’s
goblet,
grateful
for
something
to
clutch.
The
lifelike
head
of
a
snarling
direwolf
was
raised
on
the
side
of
the
cup.
He
felt
the
silver
muzzle
pressing
against
his
palm,
and
remembered
the
last
time
he
had
seen
his
lord
father
drink
from
this
goblet.

It
had
been
the
night
of
the
welcoming
feast,
when
King
Robert
had
brought
his
court
to
Winterfell.
Summer
still
reigned
then.
His
parents
had
shared
the
dais
with
Robert
and
his
queen,
with
her
brothers
beside
her.
Uncle
Benjen
had
been
there
too,
all
in
black.
Bran
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
sat
with
the
king’s
children,
Joffrey
and
Tommen
and
Princess
Myrcella,
who’d
spent
the
whole
meal
gazing
at
Robb
with
adoring
eyes.
Arya
made
faces
across
the
table
when
no
one
was
looking;
Sansa
listened
raptly
while
the
king’s
high
harper
sang
songs
of
chivalry,
and
Rickon
kept
asking
why
Jon
wasn’t
with
them.
“Because
he’s
a
bastard,”
Bran
finally
had
to
whisper
to
him.

And
now
they
are
all
gone.
It
was
as
if
some
cruel
god
had
reached
down
with
a
great
hand
and
swept
them
all
away,
the
girls
to
captivity,
Jon
to
the
Wall,
Robb
and
Mother
to
war,
King
Robert
and
Father
to
their
graves,
and
perhaps
Uncle
Benjen
as
well…

Even
down
on
the
benches,
there
were
new
men
at
the
tables.
Jory
was
dead,
and
Fat
Tom,
and
Porther,
Alyn,
Desmond,
Hullen
who
had
been
master
of
horse,
Harwin
his
son…
all
those
who
had
gone
south
with
his
father,
even
Septa
Mordane
and
Vayon
Poole.
The
rest
had
ridden
to
war
with
Robb,
and
might
soon
be
dead
as
well
for
all
Bran
knew.
He
liked
Hayhead
and
Poxy
Tym
and
Skittrick
and
the
other
new
men
well
enough,
but
he
missed
his
old
friends.

He
looked
up
and
down
the
benches
at
all
the
faces
happy
and
sad,
and
wondered
who
would
be
missing
next
year
and
the
year
after.
He
might
have
cried
then,
but
he
couldn’t.
He
was
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,
his
father’s
son
and
his
brother’s
heir,
and
almost
a
man
grown.

At
the
foot
of
the
hall,
the
doors
opened
and
a
gust
of
cold
air
made
the
torches
flame
brighter
for
an
instant.
Alebelly
led
two
new
guests
into
the
feast.
“The
Lady
Meera
of
House
Reed,”
the
rotund
guardsman
bellowed
over
the
clamor.
“With
her
brother,
Jojen,
of
Greywater
Watch.”

Men
looked
up
from
their
cups
and
trenchers
to
eye
the
newcomers.
Bran
heard
Little
Walder
mutter,
“Frogeaters,”
to
Big
Walder
beside
him.
Ser
Rodrik
climbed
to
his
feet.
“Be
welcome,
friends,
and
share
this
harvest
with
us.”
Serving
men
hurried
to
lengthen
the
table
on
the
dais,
fetching
trestles
and
chairs.

“Who
are
they?”
Rickon
asked.

“Mudmen,”
answered
Little
Walder
disdainfully.
“They’re
thieves
and
cravens,
and
they
have
green
teeth
from
eating
frogs.”

Maester
Luwin
crouched
beside
Bran’s
seat
to
whisper
counsel
in
his
ear.
“You
must
greet
these
ones
warmly.
I
had
not
thought
to
see
them
here,
but…
you
know
who
they
are?”

Bran
nodded.
“Crannogmen.
From
the
Neck.”

“Howland
Reed
was
a
great
friend
to
your
father,”
Ser
Rodrik
told
him.
“These
two
are
his,
it
would
seem.”

As
the
newcomers
walked
the
length
of
the
hall,
Bran
saw
that
one
was
indeed
a
girl,
though
he
would
never
have
known
it
by
her
dress.
She
wore
lambskin
breeches
soft
with
long
use,
and
a
sleeveless
jerkin
armored
in
bronze
scales.
Though
near
Robb’s
age,
she
was
slim
as
a
boy,
with
long
brown
hair
knotted
behind
her
head
and
only
the
barest
suggestion
of
breasts.
A
woven
net
hung
from
one
slim
hip,
a
long
bronze
knife
from
the
other;
under
her
arm
she
carried
an
old
iron
greathelm
spotted
with
rust;
a
frog
spear
and
round
leathern
shield
were
strapped
to
her
back.

Her
brother
was
several
years
younger
and
bore
no
weapons.
All
his
garb
was
green,
even
to
the
leather
of
his
boots,
and
when
he
came
closer
Bran
saw
that
his
eyes
were
the
color
of
moss,
though
his
teeth
looked
as
white
as
anyone
else’s.
Both
Reeds
were
slight
of
build,
slender
as
swords
and
scarcely
taller
than
Bran
himself.
They
went
to
one
knee
before
the
dais.

“My
lords
of
Stark,”
the
girl
said.
“The
years
have
passed
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands
since
my
folk
first
swore
their
fealty
to
the
King
in
the
North.
My
lord
father
has
sent
us
here
to
say
the
words
again,
for
all
our
people.”

She
is
looking
at
me,
Bran
realized.
He
had
to
make
some
answer.
“My
brother
Robb
is
fighting
in
the
south,”
he
said,
“but
you
can
say
your
words
to
me,
if
you
like.”

“To
Winterfell
we
pledge
the
faith
of
Greywater,”
they
said
together.
“Hearth
and
heart
and
harvest
we
yield
up
to
you,
my
lord.
Our
swords
and
spears
and
arrows
are
yours
to
command.
Grant
mercy
to
our
weak,
help
to
our
helpless,
and
justice
to
all,
and
we
shall
never
fail
you.”

“I
swear
it
by
earth
and
water,”
said
the
boy
in
green.

“I
swear
it
by
bronze
and
iron,”
his
sister
said.

“We
swear
it
by
ice
and
fire,”
they
finished
together.

Bran
groped
for
words.
Was
he
supposed
to
swear
something
back
to
them?
Their
oath
was
not
one
he
had
been
taught.
“May
your
winters
be
short
and
your
summers
bountiful,”
he
said.
That
was
usually
a
good
thing
to
say.
“Rise.
I’m
Brandon
Stark.”

The
girl,
Meera,
got
to
her
feet
and
helped
her
brother
up.
The
boy
stared
at
Bran
all
the
while.
“We
bring
you
gifts
of
fish
and
frog
and
fowl,”
he
said.

“I
thank
you.”
Bran
wondered
if
he
would
have
to
eat
a
frog
to
be
polite.
“I
offer
you
the
meat
and
mead
of
Winterfell.”
He
tried
to
recall
all
he
had
been
taught
of
the
crannogmen,
who
dwelt
amongst
the
bogs
of
the
Neck
and
seldom
left
their
wetlands.
They
were
a
poor
folk,
fishers
and
frog-hunters
who
lived
in
houses
of
thatch
and
woven
reeds
on
floating
islands
hidden
in
the
deeps
of
the
swamp.
It
was
said
that
they
were
a
cowardly
people
who
fought
with
poisoned
weapons
and
preferred
to
hide
from
foes
rather
than
face
them
in
open
battle.
And
yet
Howland
Reed
had
been
one
of
Father’s
staunchest
companions
during
the
war
for
King
Robert’s
crown,
before
Bran
was
born.

The
boy,
Jojen,
looked
about
the
hall
curiously
as
he
took
his
seat.
“Where
are
the
direwolves?”

“In
the
godswood,”
Rickon
answered.
“Shaggy
was
bad.”

“My
brother
would
like
to
see
them,”
the
girl
said.

Little
Walder
spoke
up
loudly.
“He’d
best
watch
they
don’t
see
him,
or
they’ll
take
a
bite
out
of
him.”

“They
won’t
bite
if
I’m
there.”
Bran
was
pleased
that
they
wanted
to
see
the
wolves.
“Summer
won’t
anyway,
and
he’ll
keep
Shaggydog
away.”
He
was
curious
about
these
mudmen.
He
could
not
recall
ever
seeing
one
before.
His
father
had
sent
letters
to
the
Lord
of
Greywater
over
the
years,
but
none
of
the
crannogmen
had
ever
called
at
Winterfell.
He
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
them
more,
but
the
Great
Hall
was
so
noisy
that
it
was
hard
to
hear
anyone
who
wasn’t
right
beside
you.

Ser
Rodrik
was
right
beside
Bran.
“Do
they
truly
eat
frogs?”
he
asked
the
old
knight.

“Aye,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“Frogs
and
fish
and
lizard-lions,
and
all
manner
of
birds.”

Maybe
they
don’t
have
sheep
and
cattle,
Bran
thought.
He
commanded
the
serving
men
to
bring
them
mutton
chops
and
a
slice
off
the
aurochs
and
fill
their
trenchers
with
beef-and-barley
stew.
They
seemed
to
like
that
well
enough.
The
girl
caught
him
staring
at
her
and
smiled.
Bran
blushed
and
looked
away.

Much
later,
after
all
the
sweets
had
been
served
and
washed
down
with
gallons
of
surnmerwine,
the
food
was
cleared
and
the
tables
shoved
back
against
the
walls
to
make
room
for
the
dancing.
The
music
grew
wilder,
the
drummers
joined
in,
and
Hother
Umber
brought
forth
a
huge
curved
warhorn
banded
in
silver.
When
the
singer
reached
the
part
in
“The
Night
That
Ended”
where
the
Night’s
Watch
rode
forth
to
meet
the
Others
in
the
Battle
for
the
Dawn,
he
blew
a
blast
that
set
all
the
dogs
to
barking.

Two
Glover
men
began
a
spinning
skirl
on
bladder
and
woodharp.
Mors
Umber
was
the
first
on
his
feet.
He
seized
a
passing
serving
girl
by
the
arm,
knocking
the
flagon
of
wine
out
of
her
hands
to
shatter
on
the
floor.
Amidst
the
rushes
and
bones
and
bits
of
bread
that
littered
the
stone,
he
whirled
her
and
spun
her
and
tossed
her
in
the
air.
The
girl
squealed
with
laughter
and
turned
red
as
her
skirts
swirled
and
lifted.

Others
soon
joined
in.
Hodor
began
to
dance
all
by
himself,
while
Lord
Wyman
asked
little
Beth
Cassel
to
partner
him.
For
all
his
size,
he
moved
gracefully.
When
he
tired,
Cley
Cerwyn
danced
with
the
child
in
his
stead.
Ser
Rodrik
approached
Lady
Hornwood,
but
she
made
her
excuses
and
took
her
leave.
Bran
watched
long
enough
to
be
polite,
and
then
had
Hodor
summoned.
He
was
hot
and
tired,
flushed
from
the
wine,
and
the
dancing
made
him
sad.
it
was
something
else
he
could
never
do.
“I
want
to
go.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
shouted
back,
kneeling.
Maester
Luwin
and
Hayhead
lifted
him
into
his
basket.
The
folk
of
Winterfell
had
seen
this
sight
half
a
hundred
times,
but
doubtless
it
looked
queer
to
the
guests,
some
of
whom
were
more
curious
than
polite.
Bran
felt
the
stares.

They
went
out
the
rear
rather
than
walk
the
length
of
the
hall,
Bran
ducking
his
head
as
they
passed
through
the
lord’s
door.
In
the
dim-lit
gallery
outside
the
Great
Hall,
they
came
upon
Joseth
the
master
of
horse
engaged
in
a
different
sort
of
riding.
He
had
some
woman
Bran
did
not
know
shoved
up
against
the
wall,
her
skirts
around
her
waist.
She
was
giggling
until
Hodor
stopped
to
watch.
Then
she
screamed.
“Leave
them
be,
Hodor,”
Bran
had
to
tell
him.
“Take
me
to
my
bedchamber.”

Hodor
carried
him
up
the
winding
steps
to
his
tower
and
knelt
beside
one
of
the
iron
bars
that
Mikken
had
driven
into
the
wall.
Bran
used
the
bars
to
move
himself
to
the
bed,
and
Hodor
pulled
off
his
boots
and
breeches.
“You
can
go
back
to
the
feast
now,
but
don’t
go
bothering
Joseth
and
that
woman,”
Bran
said.

“Hodor,”
Hodor
replied,
bobbing
his
head.

When
he
blew
out
his
bedside
candle,
darkness
covered
him
like
a
soft,
familiar
blanket.
The
faint
sound
of
music
drifted
through
his
shuttered
window.

Something
his
father
had
told
him
once
when
he
was
little
came
back
to
him
suddenly.
He
had
asked
Lord
Eddard
if
the
Kingsguard
were
truly
the
finest
knights
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
“No
longer,”
he
answered,
“but
once
they
were
a
marvel,
a
shining
lesson
to
the
world.”

“Was
there
one
who
was
best
of
all?”

“The
finest
knight
I
ever
saw
was
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
who
fought
with
a
blade
called
Dawn,
forged
from
the
heart
of
a
fallen
star.
They
called
him
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
and
he
would
have
killed
me
but
for
Howland
Reed.”
Father
had
gotten
sad
then,
and
he
would
say
no
more.
Bran
wished
he
had
asked
him
what
he
meant.

He
went
to
sleep
with
his
head
full
of
knights
in
gleaming
armor,
fighting
with
swords
that
shone
like
starfire,
but
when
the
dream
came
he
was
in
the
godswood
again.
The
smells
from
the
kitchen
and
the
Great
Hall
were
so
strong
that
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
never
left
the
feast.
He
prowled
beneath
the
trees,
his
brother
close
behind
him.
This
night
was
wildly
alive,
full
of
the
howling
of
the
man-pack
at
their
play.
The
sounds
made
him
restless.
He
wanted
to
run,
to
hunt,
he
wanted
to—

The
rattle
of
iron
made
his
ears
prick
up.
His
brother
heard
it
too.
They
raced
through
the
undergrowth
toward
the
sound.
Bounding
across
the
still
water
at
the
foot
of
the
old
white
one,
he
caught
the
scent
of
a
stranger,
the
man-smell
well
mixed
with
leather
and
earth
and
iron.

The
intruders
had
pushed
a
few
yards
into
the
wood
when
he
came
upon
them;
a
female
and
a
young
male,
with
no
taint
of
fear
to
them,
even
when
he
showed
them
the
white
of
his
teeth.
His
brother
growled
low
in
his
throat,
yet
still
they
did
not
run.

“Here
they
come,”
the
female
said.
Meera,
some
part
of
him
whispered,
some
wisp
of
the
sleeping
boy
lost
in
the
wolf
dream.
“Did
you
know
they
would
be
so
big?”

“They
will
be
bigger
still
before
they
are
grown,”
the
young
male
said,
watching
them
with
eyes
large,
green,
and
unafraid.
“The
black
one
is
full
of
fear
and
rage,
but
the
grey
is
strong…
stronger
than
he
knows…
can
you
feel
him,
sister?”

“No,”
she
said,
moving
a
hand
to
the
hilt
of
the
long
brown
knife
she
wore.
“Go
careful,
Joien.”

“He
won’t
hurt
me.
This
is
not
the
day
I
die.”
The
male
walked
toward
them,
unafraid,
and
reached
out
for
his
muzzle,
a
touch
as
light
as
a
summer
breeze.
Yet
at
the
brush
of
those
fingers
the
wood
dissolved
and
the
very
ground
turned
to
smoke
beneath
his
feet
and
swirled
away
laughing,
and
then
he
was
spinning
and
falling,
falling,
falling…





CATELYN

As
she
slept
amidst
the
rolling
grasslands,
Catelyn
dreamt
that
Bran
was
whole
again,
that
Arya
and
Sansa
held
hands,
that
Rickon
was
still
a
babe
at
her
breast.
Robb,
crownless,
played
with
a
wooden
sword,
and
when
all
were
safe
asleep,
she
found
Ned
in
her
bed,
smiling.

Sweet
it
was,
sweet
and
gone
too
soon.
Dawn
came
cruel,
a
dagger
of
light.
She
woke
aching
and
alone
and
weary;
weary
of
riding,
weary
of
hurting,
weary
of
duty.
I
want
to
weep,
she
thought.
I
want
to
be
comforted.
I’m
so
tired
of
being
strong.
I
want
to
be
foolish
and
frightened
for
once.
Just
for
a
small
while,
that’s
all…
a
day…
an
hour…

Outside
her
tent,
men
were
stirring.
She
heard
the
whicker
of
horses,
Shadd
complaining
of
stiffness
in
his
back,
Ser
Wendel
calling
for
his
bow.
Catelyn
wished
they
would
all
go
away.
They
were
good
men,
loyal,
yet
she
was
tired
of
them
all.
It
was
her
children
she
yearned
after.
One
day,
she
promised
herself
as
she
lay
abed,
one
day
she
would
allow
herself
to
be
less
than
strong.

But
not
today.
It
could
not
be
today.

Her
fingers
seemed
more
clumsy
than
usual
as
she
fumbled
on
her
clothes.
She
supposed
she
ought
to
be
grateful
that
she
had
any
use
of
her
hands
at
all.
The
dagger
had
been
Valyrian
steel,
and
Valyrian
steel
bites
deep
and
sharp.
She
had
only
to
look
at
the
scars
to
remember.

Outside,
Shadd
was
stirring
oats
into
a
kettle,
while
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
sat
stringing
his
bow.
“My
lady,”
he
said
when
Catelyn
emerged.
“There
are
birds
in
this
grass.
Would
you
fancy
a
roast
quail
to
break
your
fast
this
morning?”

“Oats
and
bread
are
sufficient…
for
all
of
us,
I
think.
We
have
many
leagues
yet
to
ride,
Ser
Wendel.”

“As
you
will,
my
lady.”
The
knight’s
moon
face
looked
crestfallen,
the
tips
of
his
great
walrus
mustache
twitching
with
disappointment.
“Oats
and
bread,
and
what
could
be
better?”
He
was
one
of
the
fattest
men
Catelyn
had
ever
known,
but
howevermuch
he
loved
his
food,
he
loved
his
honor
more.

“Found
some
nettles
and
brewed
a
tea,”
Shadd
announced.
“Will
m’lady
take
a
cup?”

“Yes,
with
thanks.”

She
cradled
the
tea
in
her
scarred
hands
and
blew
on
it
to
cool
it.
Shadd
was
one
of
the
Winterfell
men.
Robb
had
sent
twenty
of
his
best
to
see
her
safely
to
Renly.
He
had
sent
five
lordlings
as
well,
whose
names
and
high
birth
would
add
weight
and
honor
to
her
mission.
As
they
made
their
way
south,
staying
well
clear
of
towns
and
holdfasts,
they
had
seen
bands
of
mailed
men
more
than
once,
and
glimpsed
smoke
on
the
eastern
horizon,
but
none
had
dared
molest
them.
They
were
too
weak
to
be
a
threat,
too
many
to
be
easy
prey.
Once
across
the
Blackwater,
the
worst
was
behind.
For
the
past
four
days,
they
had
seen
no
signs
of
war.

Catelyn
had
never
wanted
this.
She
had
told
Robb
as
much,
back
in
Riverrun.
“When
last
I
saw
Renly,
he
was
a
boy
no
older
than
Bran.
I
do
not
know
him.
Send
someone
else.
My
place
is
here
with
my
father,
for
whatever
time
he
has
left.”

Her
son
had
looked
at
her
unhappily.
“There
is
no
one
else.
I
cannot
go
myself.
Your
father’s
too
ill.
The
Blackfish
is
my
eyes
and
ears,
I
dare
not
lose
him.
Your
brother
I
need
to
hold
Riverrun
when
we
march—”

“March?”
No
one
had
said
a
word
to
her
of
marching.

“I
cannot
sit
at
Riverrun
waiting
for
peace.
It
makes
me
look
as
if
I
were
afraid
to
take
the
field
again.
When
there
are
no
battles
to
fight,
men
start
to
think
of
hearth
and
harvest,
Father
told
me
that.
Even
my
northmen
grow
restless.”

My
northmen,
she
thought.
He
is
even
starting
to
talk
like
a
king.
“No
one
has
ever
died
of
restlessness,
but
rashness
is
another
matter.
We’ve
planted
seeds,
let
them
grow.”

Robb
shook
his
head
stubbornly.
“We’ve
tossed
some
seeds
in
the
wind,
that’s
all.
if
your
sister
Lysa
was
coming
to
aid
us,
we
would
have
heard
by
now.
How
many
birds
have
we
sent
to
the
Eyrie,
four?
I
want
peace
too,
but
why
should
the
Lannisters
give
me
anything
if
all
I
do
is
sit
here
while
my
army
melts
away
around
me
swift
as
summer
snow?”

“So
rather
than
look
craven,
you
will
dance
to
Lord
Tywin’s
pipes?”
she
threw
back.
“He
wants
you
to
march
on
Harrenhal,
ask
your
uncle
Brynden
if—”

“I
said
nothing
of
Harrenhal,”
Robb
said.
“Now,
will
you
go
to
Renly
for
me,
or
must
I
send
the
Greatjon?”

The
memory
brought
a
wan
smile
to
her
face.
Such
an
obvious
ploy,
that,
yet
deft
for
a
boy
of
fifteen.
Robb
knew
how
ill-suited
a
man
like
Greatjon
Umber
would
be
to
treat
with
a
man
like
Renly
Baratheon,
and
he
knew
that
she
knew
it
as
well.
What
could
she
do
but
accede,
praying
that
her
father
would
live
until
her
return?
Had
Lord
Hoster
been
well,
he
would
have
gone
himself,
she
knew.
Still,
that
leavetaking
was
hard,
hard.
He
did
not
even
know
her
when
she
came
to
say
farewell.
“Minisa,”
he
called
her,
“where
are
the
children?
My
little
Cat,
my
sweet
Lysa…”
Catelyn
had
kissed
him
on
the
brow
and
told
him
his
babes
were
well.
“Wait
for
me,
my
lord,”
she
said
as
his
eyes
closed.
“I
waited
for
you,
oh,
so
many
times.
Now
you
must
wait
for
me.”

Fate
drives
me
south
and
south
again,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
sipped
the
astringent
tea,
when
it
is
north
I
should
be
going,
north
to
home.
She
had
written
to
Bran
and
Rickon,
that
last
night
at
Riverrun.
I
do
not
forget
you,
my
sweet
ones,
you
must
believe
that.
It
is
only
that
your
brother
needs
me
more.

“We
ought
to
reach
the
upper
Mander
today,
my
lady,”
Ser
Wendel
announced
while
Shadd
spooned
out
the
porridge.
“Lord
Renly
will
not
be
far,
if
the
talk
be
true.”

And
what
do
I
tell
him
when
I
find
him?
That
my
son
holds
him
no
true
king?
She
did
not
relish
this
meeting.
They
needed
friends,
not
more
enemies,
yet
Robb
would
never
bend
the
knee
in
homage
to
a
man
he
felt
had
no
claim
to
the
throne.

Her
bowl
was
empty,
though
she
could
scarce
remember
tasting
the
porridge.
She
laid
it
aside.
“It
is
time
we
were
away.”
The
sooner
she
spoke
to
Renly,
the
sooner
she
could
turn
for
home.
She
was
the
first
one
mounted,
and
she
set
the
pace
for
the
column.
Hal
Mollen
rode
beside
her,
bearing
the
banner
of
House
Stark,
the
grey
direwolf
on
an
ice-white
field.

They
were
still
a
half
day’s
ride
from
Renly’s
camp
when
they
were
taken.
Robin
Flint
had
ranged
ahead
to
scout,
and
he
came
galloping
back
with
word
of
a
far-eyes
watching
from
the
roof
of
a
distant
windmill.
By
the
time
Catelyn’s
party
reached
the
mill,
the
man
was
long
gone.
They
pressed
on,
covering
not
quite
a
mile
before
Renly’s
outriders
came
swooping
down
on
them,
twenty
men
mailed
and
mounted,
led
by
a
grizzled
greybeard
of
a
knight
with
bluejays
on
his
surcoat.

When
he
saw
her
banners,
he
trotted
up
to
her
alone.
“My
lady,”
he
called,
“I
am
Ser
Colen
of
Greenpools,
as
it
please
you.
These
are
dangerous
lands
you
cross.”

“Our
business
is
urgent,”
she
answered
him.
“I
come
as
envoy
from
my
son,
Robb
Stark,
the
King
in
the
North,
to
treat
with
Renly
Baratheon,
the
King
in
the
South.”

“King
Renly
is
the
crowned
and
anointed
lord
of
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
my
lady,”
Ser
Colen
answered,
though
courteously
enough.
“His
Grace
is
encamped
with
his
host
near
Bitterbridge,
where
the
roseroad
crosses
the
Mander.
It
shall
be
my
great
honor
to
escort
you
to
him.”
The
knight
raised
a
mailed
hand,
and
his
men
formed
a
double
column
flanking
Catelyn
and
her
guard.
Escort
or
captor?
she
wondered.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
trust
in
Ser
Colen’s
honor,
and
Lord
Renly’s.

They
saw
the
smoke
of
the
camp’s
fires
when
they
were
still
an
hour
from
the
river.
Then
the
sound
came
drifting
across
farm
and
field
and
rolling
plain,
indistinct
as
the
murmur
of
some
distant
sea,
but
swelling
as
they
rode
closer.
By
the
time
they
caught
sight
of
the
Mander’s
muddy
waters
glinting
in
the
sun,
they
could
make
out
the
voices
of
men,
the
clatter
of
steel,
the
whinny
of
horses.
Yet
neither
sound
nor
smoke
prepared
them
for
the
host
itself.

Thousands
of
cookfires
filled
the
air
with
a
pale
smoky
haze.
The
horse
lines
alone
stretched
out
over
leagues.
A
forest
had
surely
been
felled
to
make
the
tall
staffs
that
held
the
banners.
Great
siege
engines
lined
the
grassy
verge
of
the
roseroad,
mangonels
and
trebuchets
and
rolling
rams
mounted
on
wheels
taller
than
a
man
on
horseback.
The
steel
points
of
pikes
flamed
red
with
sunlight,
as
if
already
blooded,
while
the
pavilions
of
the
knights
and
high
lords
sprouted
from
the
grass
like
silken
mushrooms.
She
saw
men
with
spears
and
men
with
swords,
men
in
steel
caps
and
mail
shirts,
camp
followers
strutting
their
charms,
archers
fletching
arrows,
teamsters
driving
wagons,
swineherds
driving
pigs,
pages
running
messages,
squires
honing
swords,
knights
riding
palfreys,
grooms
leading
ill-tempered
destriers.
“This
is
a
fearsome
lot
of
men,”
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
observed
as
they
crossed
the
ancient
stone
span
from
which
Bitterbridge
took
its
name.

“That
it
is,”
Catelyn
agreed.

Near
all
the
chivalry
of
the
south
had
come
to
Renly’s
call,
it
seemed.
The
golden
rose
of
Highgarden
was
seen
everywhere:
sewn
on
the
right
breast
of
armsmen
and
servants,
flapping
and
fluttering
from
the
green
silk
banners
that
adorned
lance
and
pike,
painted
upon
the
shields
hung
outside
the
pavilions
of
the
sons
and
brothers
and
cousins
and
uncles
of
House
Tyrell.
As
well
Catelyn
spied
the
fox-and-flowers
of
House
Florent,
Fossoway
apples
red
and
green,
Lord
Tarly’s
striding
huntsman,
oak
leaves
for
Oakheart,
cranes
for
Crane,
a
cloud
of
black-and-orange
butterflies
for
the
Mullendores.

Across
the
Mander,
the
storm
lords
had
raised
their
standards—Renly’s
own
bannermen,
sworn
to
House
Baratheon
and
Storm’s
End.
Catelyn
recognized
Bryce
Caron’s
nightingales,
the
Penrose
quills,
and
Lord
Estermont’s
sea
turtle,
green
on
green.
Yet
for
every
shield
she
knew,
there
were
a
dozen
strange
to
her,
borne
by
the
small
lords
sworn
to
the
bannermen,
and
by
hedge
knights
and
freeriders,
who
had
come
swarming
to
make
Renly
Baratheon
a
king
in
fact
as
well
as
name.

Renly’s
own
standard
flew
high
over
all.
From
the
top
of
his
tallest
siege
tower,
a
wheeled
oaken
immensity
covered
with
rawhides,
streamed
the
largest
war
banner
that
Catelyn
had
ever
seen—a
cloth
big
enough
to
carpet
many
a
hall,
shimmering
gold,
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
black
upon
it,
prancing
proud
and
tall.

“My
lady,
do
you
hear
that
noise?”
asked
Hallis
Mollen,
trotting
close.
“What
is
that?”

She
listened.
Shouts,
and
horses
screaming,
and
the
clash
of
steel,
and…“Cheering,”
she
said.
They
had
been
riding
up
a
gentle
slope
toward
a
line
of
brightly
colored
pavilions
on
the
height.
As
they
passed
between
them,
the
press
of
men
grew
thicker,
the
sounds
louder.
And
then
she
saw.

Below,
beneath
the
stone-and-timber
battlements
of
a
small
castle,
a
melee
was
in
progress.

A
field
had
been
cleared
off,
fences
and
galleries
and
tilting
barriers
thrown
up.
Hundreds
were
gathered
to
watch,
perhaps
thousands.
From
the
looks
of
the
grounds,
torn
and
muddy
and
littered
with
bits
of
dinted
armor
and
broken
lances,
they
had
been
at
it
for
a
day
or
more,
but
now
the
end
was
near.
Fewer
than
a
score
of
knights
remained
ahorse,
charging
and
slashing
at
each
other
as
watchers
and
fallen
combatants
cheered
them
on.
She
saw
two
destriers
collide
in
full
armor,
going
down
in
a
tangle
of
steel
and
horseflesh.
“A
tourney,”
Hal
Mollen
declared.
He
had
a
penchant
for
loudly
announcing
the
obvious.

“Oh,
splendid,”
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
said
as
a
knight
in
a
rainbow-striped
cloak
wheeled
to
deliver
a
backhand
blow
with
a
long-handled
axe
that
shattered
the
shield
of
the
man
pursuing
him
and
sent
him
reeling
in
his
stirrups.

The
press
in
front
of
them
made
further
progress
difficult.
“Lady
Stark,”
Ser
Colen
said,
“if
your
men
would
be
so
good
as
to
wait
here,
I’ll
present
you
to
the
king.”

“As
you
say.”
She
gave
the
command,
though
she
had
to
raise
her
voice
to
be
heard
above
the
tourney
din.
Ser
Colen
walked
his
horse
slowly
through
the
throngs,
with
Catelyn
riding
in
his
wake.
A
roar
went
up
from
the
crowd
as
a
helmetless
red-bearded
man
with
a
griffin
on
his
shield
went
down
before
a
big
knight
in
blue
armor.
His
steel
was
a
deep
cobalt,
even
the
blunt
morningstar
he
wielded
with
such
deadly
effect,
his
mount
barded
in
the
quartered
sun-and-moon
heraldry
of
House
Tarth.

“Red
Ronnet’s
down,
gods
be
damned,”
a
man
cursed.

“Loras’ll
do
for
that
blue—”
a
companion
answered
before
a
roar
drowned
out
the
rest
of
his
words.

Another
man
was
fallen,
trapped
beneath
his
injured
horse,
both
of
them
screaming
in
pain.
Squires
rushed
out
to
aid
them.

This
is
madness,
Catelyn
thought.
Real
enemies
on
every
side
and
half
the
realm
in
flames,
and
Renly
sits
here
playing
at
war
like
a
boy
with
his
first
wooden
sword.

The
lords
and
ladies
in
the
gallery
were
as
engrossed
in
the
melee
as
the
men
on
the
ground.
Catelyn
marked
them
well.
Her
father
had
oft
treated
with
the
southron
lords,
and
not
a
few
had
been
guests
at
Riverrun.
She
recognized
Lord
Mathis
Rowan,
stouter
and
more
florid
than
ever,
the
golden
tree
of
his
House
spread
across
his
white
doublet.
Below
him
sat
Lady
Oakheart,
tiny
and
delicate,
and
to
her
left
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
of
Horn
Hill,
his
greatsword
Heartsbane
propped
up
against
the
back
of
his
seat.
Others
she
knew
only
by
their
sigils,
and
some
not
at
all.

In
their
midst,
watching
and
laughing
with
his
young
queen
by
his
side,
sat
a
ghost
in
a
golden
crown.

Small
wonder
the
lords
gather
around
him
with
such
fervor,
she
thought,
he
is
Robert
come
again.
Renly
was
handsome
as
Robert
had
been
handsome;
long
of
limb
and
broad
of
shoulder,
with
the
same
coal-black
hair,
fine
and
straight,
the
same
deep
blue
eyes,
the
same
easy
smile.
The
slender
circlet
around
his
brows
seemed
to
suit
him
well.
It
was
soft
gold,
a
ring
of
roses
exquisitely
wrought;
at
the
front
lifted
a
stag’s
head
of
dark
green
jade,
adorned
with
golden
eyes
and
golden
antlers.

The
crowned
stag
decorated
the
king’s
green
velvet
tunic
as
well,
worked
in
gold
thread
upon
his
chest;
the
Baratheon
sigil
in
the
colors
of
Highgarden.
The
girl
who
shared
the
high
seat
with
him
was
also
of
Highgarden:
his
young
queen,
Margaery,
daughter
to
Lord
Mace
Tyrell.
Their
marriage
was
the
mortar
that
held
the
great
southron
alliance
together,
Catelyn
knew.
Renly
was
one-and-twenty,
the
girl
no
older
than
Robb,
very
pretty,
with
a
doe’s
soft
eyes
and
a
mane
of
curling
brown
hair
that
fell
about
her
shoulders
in
lazy
ringlets.
Her
smile
was
shy
and
sweet.

Out
in
the
field,
another
man
lost
his
seat
to
the
knight
in
the
rainbow-striped
cloak,
and
the
king
shouted
approval
with
the
rest.
“Loras!”
she
heard
him
call.
“Loras!
Highgarden!”
The
queen
clapped
her
hands
together
in
excitement.

Catelyn
turned
to
see
the
end
of
it.
Only
four
men
were
left
in
the
fight
now,
and
there
was
small
doubt
whom
king
and
commons
favored.
She
had
never
met
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
but
even
in
the
distant
north
one
heard
tales
of
the
prowess
of
the
young
Knight
of
Flowers.
Ser
Loras
rode
a
tall
white
stallion
in
silver
mail,
and
fought
with
a
long-handled
axe.
A
crest
of
golden
roses
ran
down
the
center
of
his
helm.

Two
of
the
other
survivors
had
made
common
cause.
They
spurred
their
mounts
toward
the
knight
in
the
cobalt
armor.
As
they
closed
to
either
side,
the
blue
knight
reined
hard,
smashing
one
man
full
in
the
face
with
his
splintered
shield
while
his
black
destrier
lashed
out
with
a
steel-shod
hoof
at
the
other.
In
a
blink,
one
combatant
was
unhorsed,
the
other
reeling.
The
blue
knight
let
his
broken
shield
drop
to
the
ground
to
free
his
left
arm,
and
then
the
Knight
of
Flowers
was
on
him.
The
weight
of
his
steel
seemed
to
hardly
diminish
the
grace
and
quickness
with
which
Ser
Loras
moved,
his
rainbow
cloak
swirling
about
him.

The
white
horse
and
the
black
one
wheeled
like
lovers
at
a
harvest
dance,
the
riders
throwing
steel
in
place
of
kisses.
Longaxe
flashed
and
morningstar
whirled.
Both
weapons
were
blunted,
yet
still
they
raised
an
awful
clangor.
Shieldless,
the
blue
knight
was
getting
much
the
worse
of
it.
Ser
Loras
rained
down
blows
on
his
head
and
shoulders,
to
shouts
of
“Highgarden!”
from
the
throng.
The
other
gave
answer
with
his
morningstar,
but
whenever
the
ball
came
crashing
in,
Ser
Loras
interposed
his
battered
green
shield,
emblazoned
with
three
golden
roses.
When
the
longaxe
caught
the
blue
knight’s
hand
on
the
backswing
and
sent
the
morningstar
flying
from
his
grasp,
the
crowd
screamed
like
a
rutting
beast.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
raised
his
axe
for
the
final
blow.

The
blue
knight
charged
into
it.
The
stallions
slammed
together,
the
blunted
axehead
smashed
against
the
scarred
blue
breastplate…
but
somehow
the
blue
knight
had
the
haft
locked
between
steel-gauntleted
fingers.
He
wrenched
it
from
Ser
Loras’s
hand,
and
suddenly
the
two
were
grappling
mount-to-mount,
and
an
instant
later
they
were
falling.
As
their
horses
pulled
apart,
they
crashed
to
the
ground
with
bone-jarring
force.
Loras
Tyrell,
on
the
bottom,
took
the
brunt
of
the
impact.
The
blue
knight
pulled
a
long
dirk
free
and
flicked
open
Tyrell’s
visor.
The
roar
of
the
crowd
was
too
loud
for
Catelyn
to
hear
what
Ser
Loras
said,
but
she
saw
the
word
form
on
his
split,
bloody
lips.
Yield.

The
blue
knight
climbed
unsteady
to
his
feet,
and
raised
his
dirk
in
the
direction
of
Renly
Baratheon,
the
salute
of
a
champion
to
his
king.
Squires
dashed
onto
the
field
to
help
the
vanquished
knight
to
his
feet.
When
they
got
his
helm
off,
Catelyn
was
startled
to
see
how
young
he
was.
He
could
not
have
had
more
than
two
years
on
Robb.
The
boy
might
have
been
as
comely
as
his
sister,
but
the
broken
lip,
unfocused
eyes,
and
blood
trickling
through
his
matted
hair
made
it
hard
to
be
certain.

“Approach,”
King
Renly
called
to
the
champion.

He
limped
toward
the
gallery.
At
close
hand,
the
brilliant
blue
armor
looked
rather
less
splendid;
everywhere
it
showed
scars,
the
dents
of
mace
and
warhammer,
the
long
gouges
left
by
swords,
chips
in
the
enameled
breastplate
and
helm.
His
cloak
hung
in
rags.
From
the
way
he
moved,
the
man
within
was
no
less
battered.
A
few
voices
hailed
him
with
cries
of
“Tarth!”
and,
oddly,
“A
Beauty!
A
Beauty!”
but
most
were
silent.
The
blue
knight
knelt
before
the
king.
“Grace,”
he
said,
his
voice
muffled
by
his
dented
greathelm.

“You
are
all
your
lord
father
claimed
you
were.”
Renly’s
voice
carried
over
the
field.
“I’ve
seen
Ser
Loras
unhorsed
once
or
twice…
but
never
quite
in
that
fashion.”

“That
were
no
proper
unhorsing,”
complained
a
drunken
archer
nearby,
a
Tyrell
rose
sewn
on
his
jerkin.
“A
vile
trick,
pulling
the
lad
down.”

The
press
had
begun
to
open
up.
“Ser
Colen,”
Catelyn
said
to
her
escort,
“who
is
this
man,
and
why
do
they
mislike
him
so?”

Ser
Colen
frowned.
“Because
he
is
no
man,
my
lady.
That’s
Brienne
of
Tarth,
daughter
to
Lord
Selwyn
the
Evenstar.”

“Daughter?”
Catelyn
was
horrified.

“Brienne
the
Beauty,
they
name
her…
though
not
to
her
face,
lest
they
be
called
upon
to
defend
those
words
with
their
bodies.”

She
heard
King
Renly
declare
the
Lady
Brienne
of
Tarth
the
victor
of
the
great
melee
at
Bitterbridge,
last
mounted
of
one
hundred
sixteen
knights.
“As
champion,
you
may
ask
of
me
any
boon
that
you
desire.
If
it
lies
in
my
power,
it
is
yours.”

“Your
Grace,”
Brienne
answered,
“I
ask
the
honor
of
a
place
among
your
Rainbow
Guard.
I
would
be
one
of
your
seven,
and
pledge
my
life
to
yours,
to
go
where
you
go,
ride
at
your
side,
and
keep
you
safe
from
all
hurt
and
harm.”

“Done,”
he
said.
“Rise,
and
remove
your
helm.”

She
did
as
he
bid
her.
And
when
the
greathelm
was
lifted,
Catelyn
understood
Ser
Colen’s
words.

Beauty,
they
called
her…
mocking.
The
hair
beneath
the
visor
was
a
squirrel’s
nest
of
dirty
straw,
and
her
face…
Brienne’s
eyes
were
large
and
very
blue,
a
young
girl’s
eyes,
trusting
and
guileless,
but
the
rest…
her
features
were
broad
and
coarse,
her
teeth
prominent
and
crooked,
her
mouth
too
wide,
her
lips
so
plump
they
seemed
swollen.
A
thousand
freckles
speckled
her
cheeks
and
brow,
and
her
nose
had
been
broken
more
than
once.
Pity
filled
Catelyn’s
heart.
Is
there
any
creature
on
earth
as
unfortunate
as
an
ugly
woman?

And
yet,
when
Renly
cut
away
her
torn
cloak
and
fastened
a
rainbow
in
its
place,
Brienne
of
Tarth
did
not
look
unfortunate.
Her
smile
lit
up
her
face,
and
her
voice
was
strong
and
proud
as
she
said,
“My
life
for
yours,
Your
Grace.
From
this
day
on,
I
am
your
shield,
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.”
The
way
she
looked
at
the
king—looked
down
at
him,
she
was
a
good
hand
higher,
though
Renly
was
near
as
tall
as
his
brother
had
been—was
painful
to
see.

“Your
Grace!”
Ser
Colen
of
Greenpools
swung
down
off
his
horse
to
approach
the
gallery.
“I
beg
your
leave.”
He
went
to
one
knee.
“I
have
the
honor
to
bring
you
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark,
sent
as
envoy
by
her
son
Robb,
Lord
of
Winterfell.”

“Lord
of
Winterfell
and
King
in
the
North,
ser,”
Catelyn
corrected
him.
She
dismounted
and
moved
to
Ser
Colen’s
side.

King
Renly
looked
surprised.
“Lady
Catelyn?
We
are
most
pleased.”
He
turned
to
his
young
queen.
“Margaery
my
sweet,
this
is
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
of
Winterfell.”

“You
are
most
welcome
here,
Lady
Stark,”
the
girl
said,
all
soft
courtesy.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
loss.”

“You
are
kind,”
said
Catelyn.

“My
lady,
I
swear
to
you,
I
will
see
that
the
Lannisters
answer
for
your
husband’s
murder,”
the
king
declared.
“When
I
take
King’s
Landing,
I’ll
send
you
Cersei’s
head.”

And
will
that
bring
my
Ned
back
to
me?
she
thought.
“It
will
be
enough
to
know
that
justice
has
been
done,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
Brienne
the
Blue
corrected
sharply.
“And
you
should
kneel
when
you
approach
the
king.”

“The
distance
between
a
lord
and
a
grace
is
a
small
one,
my
lady,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lord
Renly
wears
a
crown,
as
does
my
son.
If
you
wish,
we
may
stand
here
in
the
mud
and
debate
what
honors
and
titles
are
rightly
due
to
each,
but
it
strikes
me
that
we
have
more
pressing
matters
to
consider.”

Some
of
Renly’s
lords
bristled
at
that,
but
the
king
only
laughed.
“Well
said,
my
lady.
There
will
be
time
enough
for
graces
when
these
wars
are
done.
Tell
me,
when
does
your
son
mean
to
march
against
Harrenhal?”

Until
she
knew
whether
this
king
was
friend
or
foe,
Catelyn
was
not
about
to
reveal
the
least
part
of
Robb’s
dispositions.
“I
do
not
sit
on
my
son’s
war
councils,
my
lord.”

“So
long
as
he
leaves
a
few
Lannisters
for
me,
I’ll
not
complain.
What
has
he
done
with
the
Kingslayer?”

“Jaime
Lannister
is
held
prisoner
at
Riverrun.”

“Still
alive?”
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
seemed
dismayed.

Bemused,
Renly
said,
“It
would
seem
the
direwolf
is
gentler
than
the
lion.”

“Gentler
than
the
Lannisters,”
murmured
Lady
Oakheart
with
a
bitter
smile,
“is
drier
than
the
sea.”

“I
call
it
weak.”
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
had
a
short,
bristly
grey
beard
and
a
reputation
for
blunt
speech.
“No
disrespect
to
you,
Lady
Stark,
but
it
would
have
been
more
seemly
had
Lord
Robb
come
to
pay
homage
to
the
king
himself,
rather
than
hiding
behind
his
mother’s
skirts.”

“King
Robb
is
warring,
my
lord,”
Catelyn
replied
with
icy
courtesy,
“not
playing
at
tourney.”

Renly
grinned.
“Go
softly,
Lord
Randyll,
I
fear
you’re
overmatched.”
He
summoned
a
steward
in
the
livery
of
Storm’s
End.
“Find
a
place
for
the
lady’s
companions,
and
see
that
they
have
every
comfort.
Lady
Catelyn
shall
have
my
own
pavilion.
Since
Lord
Caswell
has
been
so
kind
as
to
give
me
use
of
his
castle,
I
have
no
need
of
it.
My
lady,
when
you
are
rested,
I
would
be
honored
if
you
would
share
our
meat
and
mead
at
the
feast
Lord
Caswell
is
giving
us
tonight.
A
farewell
feast.
I
fear
his
lordship
is
eager
to
see
the
heels
of
my
hungry
horde.”

“Not
true,
Your
Grace,”
protested
a
wispy
young
man
who
must
have
been
Caswell.
“What
is
mine
is
yours.”

“Whenever
someone
said
that
to
my
brother
Robert,
he
took
them
at
their
word,”
Renly
said.
“Do
you
have
daughters?”

“Yes,
Your
Grace.
Two.”

“Then
thank
the
gods
that
I
am
not
Robert.
My
sweet
queen
is
all
the
woman
I
desire.”
Renly
held
out
his
hand
to
help
Margaery
to
her
feet.
“We’ll
talk
again
when
you’ve
had
a
chance
to
refresh
yourself,
Lady
Catelyn.”

Renly
led
his
bride
back
toward
the
castle
while
his
steward
conducted
Catelyn
to
the
king’s
green
silk
pavilion.
“If
you
have
need
of
anything,
you
have
only
to
ask,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
could
scarcely
imagine
what
she
might
need
that
had
not
already
been
provided.
The
pavilion
was
larger
than
the
common
rooms
of
many
an
inn
and
furnished
with
every
comfort:
feather
mattress
and
sleeping
furs,
a
wood-and-copper
tub
large
enough
for
two,
braziers,
to
keep
off
the
night’s
chill,
slung
leather
camp
chairs,
a
writing
table
with
quills
and
inkpot,
bowls
of
peaches,
plums,
and
pears,
a
flagon
of
wine
with
a
set
of
matched
silver
cups,
cedar
chests
packed
full
of
Renly’s
clothing,
books,
maps,
game
boards,
a
high
harp,
a
tall
bow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows,
a
pair
of
red-tailed
hunting
hawks,
a
vertible
armory
of
fine
weapons.
He
does
not
stint
himself,
this
Renly,
she
thought
as
she
looked
about.
Small
wonder
this
host
moves
so
slowly.

Beside
the
entrance,
the
king’s
armor
stood
sentry;
a
suit
of
forest-green
plate,
its
fittings
chased
with
gold,
the
helm
crowned
by
a
great
rack
of
golden
antlers.
The
steel
was
polished
to
such
a
high
sheen
that
she
could
see
her
reflection
in
the
breastplate,
gazing
back
at
her
as
if
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
green
pond.
The
face
of
a
drowned
woman,
Catelyn
thought.
Can
you
drown
in
grief?
She
turned
away
sharply,
angry
with
her
own
frailty.
She
had
no
time
for
the
luxury
of
self-pity.
She
must
wash
the
dust
from
her
hair
and
change
into
a
gown
more
fitting
for
a
king’s
feast.

Ser
Wendel
Manderly,
Lucas
Blackwood,
Ser
Perwyn
Frey,
and
the
rest
of
her
highborn
companions
accompanied
her
to
the
castle.
The
great
hall
of
Lord
Caswell’s
keep
was
great
only
by
courtesy,
yet
room
was
found
on
the
crowded
benches
for
Catelyn’s
men,
amidst
Renly’s
own
knights.
Catelyn
was
assigned
a
place
on
the
dais
between
red-faced
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
and
genial
Ser
Jon
Fossoway
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways.
Ser
Jon
made
jests,
while
Lord
Mathis
inquired
politely
after
the
health
of
her
father,
brother,
and
children.

Brienne
of
Tarth
had
been
seated
at
the
far
end
of
the
high
table.
She
did
not
gown
herself
as
a
lady,
but
chose
a
knight’s
finery
instead,
a
velvet
doublet
quartered
rose-and-azure,
breeches
and
boots
and
a
fine-tooled
swordbelt,
her
new
rainbow
cloak
flowing
down
her
back.
No
garb
could
disguise
her
plainness,
though;
the
huge
freckled
hands,
the
wide
flat
face,
the
thrust
of
her
teeth.
Out
of
armor,
her
body
seemed
ungainly,
broad
of
hip
and
thick
of
limb,
with
hunched
muscular
shoulders
but
no
bosom
to
speak
of.
And
it
was
clear
from
her
every
action
that
Brienne
knew
it,
and
suffered
for
it.
She
spoke
only
in
answer,
and
seldom
lifted
her
gaze
from
her
food.

Of
food
there
was
plenty.
The
war
had
not
touched
the
fabled
bounty
of
Highgarden.
While
singers
sang
and
tumblers
tumbled,
they
began
with
pears
poached
in
wine,
and
went
on
to
tiny
savory
fish
rolled
in
salt
and
cooked
crisp,
and
capons
stuffed
with
onions
and
mushrooms.
There
were
great
loaves
of
brown
bread,
mounds
of
turnips
and
sweetcorn
and
pease,
immense
hams
and
roast
geese
and
trenchers
dripping
full
of
venison
stewed
with
beer
and
barley.
For
the
sweet,
Lord
Caswell’s
servants
brought
down
trays
of
pastries
from
his
castle
kitchens,
cream
swans
and
spun-sugar
unicorns,
lemon
cakes
in
the
shape
of
roses,
spiced
honey
biscuits
and
blackberry
tarts,
apple
crisps
and
wheels
of
buttery
cheese.

The
rich
foods
made
Catelyn
queasy,
but
it
would
never
do
to
show
frailty
when
so
much
depended
on
her
strength.
She
ate
sparingly,
while
she
watched
this
man
who
would
be
king.
Renly
sat
with
his
young
bride
on
his
left
hand
and
her
brother
on
the
right.
Apart
from
the
white
linen
bandage
around
his
brow,
Ser
Loras
seemed
none
the
worse
for
the
day’s
misadventures.
He
was
indeed
as
comely
as
Catelyn
had
suspected
he
might
be.
When
not
glazed,
his
eyes
were
lively
and
intelligent,
his
hair
an
artless
tumble
of
brown
locks
that
many
a
maid
might
have
envied.
He
had
replaced
his
tattered
tourney
cloak
with
a
new
one;
the
same
brilliantly
striped
silk
of
Renly’s
Rainbow
Guard,
clasped
with
the
golden
rose
of
Highgarden.

From
time
to
time,
King
Renly
would
feed
Margaery
some
choice
morsel
off
the
point
of
his
dagger,
or
lean
over
to
plant
the
lightest
of
kisses
on
her
cheek,
but
it
was
Ser
Loras
who
shared
most
of
his
jests
and
confidences.
The
king
enjoyed
his
food
and
drink,
that
was
plain
to
see,
yet
he
seemed
neither
glutton
nor
drunkard.
He
laughed
often,
and
well,
and
spoke
amiably
to
highborn
lords
and
lowly
serving
wenches
alike.

Some
of
his
guests
were
less
moderate.
They
drank
too
much
and
boasted
too
loudly,
to
her
mind.
Lord
Willum’s
sons
Josua
and
Elyas
disputed
heatedly
about
who
would
be
first
over
the
walls
of
King’s
Landing.
Lord
Varner
dandled
a
serving
girl
on
his
lap,
nuzzling
at
her
neck
while
one
hand
went
exploring
down
her
bodice.
Guyard
the
Green,
who
fancied
himself
a
singer,
diddled
a
harp
and
gave
them
a
verse
about
tying
lions’
tails
in
knots,
parts
of
which
rhymed.
Ser
Mark
Mullendore
brought
a
black-and-white
monkey
and
fed
him
morsels
from
his
own
plate,
while
Ser
Tanton
of
the
red-apple
Fossoways
climbed
on
the
table
and
swore
to
slay
Sandor
Clegane
in
single
combat.
The
vow
might
have
been
taken
more
solemnly
if
Ser
Tanton
had
not
had
one
foot
in
a
gravy
boat
when
he
made
it.

The
height
of
folly
was
reached
when
a
plump
fool
came
capering
out
in
gold-painted
tin
with
a
cloth
lion’s
head,
and
chased
a
dwarf
around
the
tables,
whacking
him
over
the
head
with
a
bladder.
Finally
King
Renly
demanded
to
know
why
he
was
beating
his
brother.
“Why,
Your
Grace,
I’m
the
Kinslayer,”
the
fool
said.

“It’s
Kingslayer,
fool
of
a
fool,”
Renly
said,
and
the
hall
rang
with
laughter.

Lord
Rowan
beside
her
did
not
join
the
merriment.
“They
are
all
so
young,”
he
said.

It
was
true.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
could
not
have
reached
his
second
name
day
when
Robert
slew
Prince
Rhaegar
on
the
Trident.
Few
of
the
others
were
very
much
older.
They
had
been
babes
during
the
Sack
of
King’s
Landing,
and
no
more
than
boys
when
Balon
Greyjoy
raised
the
Iron
Islands
in
rebellion.
They
are
still
unblooded,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
watched
Lord
Bryce
goad
Ser
Robar
into
juggling
a
brace
of
daggers.
It
is
all
a
game
to
them
still,
a
tourney
writ
large,
and
all
they
see
is
the
chance
for
glory
and
honor
and
spoils.
They
are
boys
drunk
on
song
and
story,
and
like
all
boys,
they
think
themselves
immortal.

“War
will
make
them
old,”
Catelyn
said,
“as
it
did
us.”
She
had
been
a
girl
when
Robert
and
Ned
and
Jon
Arryn
raised
their
banners
against
Aerys
Targaryen,
a
woman
by
the
time
the
fighting
was
done.
“I
pity
them.”

“Why?”
Lord
Rowan
asked
her.
“Look
at
them.
They’re
young
and
strong,
full
of
life
and
laughter.
And
lust,
aye,
more
lust
than
they
know
what
to
do
with.
There
will
be
many
a
bastard
bred
this
night,
I
promise
you.
Why
pity?”

“Because
it
will
not
last,”
Catelyn
answered,
sadly.
“Because
they
are
the
knights
of
summer,
and
winter
is
coming.”

“Lady
Catelyn,
you
are
wrong.”
Brienne
regarded
her
with
eyes
as
blue
as
her
armor.
“Winter
will
never
come
for
the
likes
of
us.
Should
we
die
in
battle,
they
will
surely
sing
of
us,
and
it’s
always
summer
in
the
songs.
In
the
songs
all
knights
are
gallant,
all
maids
are
beautiful,
and
the
sun
is
always
shining.”

Winter
comes
for
all
of
us,
Catelyn
thought.
For
me,
it
came
when
Ned
died.
It
will
come
for
you
too,
child,
and
sooner
than
you
like.
She
did
not
have
the
heart
to
say
it.

The
king
saved
her.
“Lady
Catelyn,”
Renly
called
down.
“I
feel
the
need
of
some
air.
Will
you
walk
with
me?”

Catelyn
stood
at
once.
“I
should
be
honored.”

Brienne
was
on
her
feet
as
well.
“Your
Grace,
give
me
but
a
moment
to
don
my
mail.
You
should
not
be
without
protection.”

King
Renly
smiled.
“If
I
am
not
safe
in
the
heart
of
Lord
Caswell’s
castle,
with
my
own
host
around
me,
one
sword
will
make
no
matter…
not
even
your
sword,
Brienne.
Sit
and
eat.
If
I
have
need
of
you,
I’ll
send
for
you.”

His
words
seemed
to
strike
the
girl
harder
than
any
blow
she
had
taken
that
afternoon.
“As
you
will,
Your
Grace.”
Brienne
sat,
eyes
downcast.
Renly
took
Catelyn’s
arm
and
led
her
from
the
hall,
past
a
slouching
guardsman
who
straightened
so
hurriedly
that
he
near
dropped
his
spear.
Renly
clapped
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
made
a
jest
of
it.

“This
way,
my
lady.”
The
king
took
her
through
a
low
door
into
a
stair
tower.
As
they
started
up,
he
said,
“Perchance,
is
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
with
your
son
at
Riverrun?”

“No,”
she
answered,
puzzled.
“Is
he
no
longer
with
Joffrey?
He
was
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.”

Renly
shook
his
head.
“The
Lannisters
told
him
he
was
too
old
and
gave
his
cloak
to
the
Hound.
I’m
told
he
left
King’s
Landing
vowing
to
take
up
service
with
the
true
king.
That
cloak
Brienne
claimed
today
was
the
one
I
was
keeping
for
Selmy,
in
hopes
that
he
might
offer
me
his
sword.
When
he
did
not
turn
up
at
Highgarden,
I
thought
perhaps
he
had
gone
to
Riverrun
instead.”

“We
have
not
seen
him.”

“He
was
old,
yes,
but
a
good
man
still.
I
hope
he
has
not
come
to
harm.
The
Lannisters
are
great
fools.”
They
climbed
a
few
more
steps.
“On
the
night
of
Robert’s
death,
I
offered
your
husband
a
hundred
swords
and
urged
him
to
take
Joffrey
into
his
power.
Had
he
listened,
he
would
be
regent
today,
and
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
me
to
claim
the
throne.”

“Ned
refused
you.”
She
did
not
have
to
be
told.

“He
had
sworn
to
protect
Robert’s
children,”
Renly
said.
“I
lacked
the
strength
to
act
alone,
so
when
Lord
Eddard
turned
me
away,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
flee.
Had
I
stayed,
I
knew
the
queen
would
see
to
it
that
I
did
not
long
outlive
my
brother.”

Had
you
stayed,
and
lent
your
support
to
Ned,
he
might
still
be
alive,
Catelyn
thought
bitterly.

“I
liked
your
husband
well
enough,
my
lady.
He
was
a
loyal
friend
to
Robert,
I
know…
but
he
would
not
listen
and
he
would
not
bend.
Here,
I
wish
to
show
you
something.”
They
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairwell.
Renly
pushed
open
a
wooden
door,
and
they
stepped
out
onto
the
roof.

Lord
Caswell’s
keep
was
scarcely
tall
enough
to
call
a
tower,
but
the
country
was
low
and
flat
and
Catelyn
could
see
for
leagues
in
all
directions.
Wherever
she
looked,
she
saw
fires.
They
covered
the
earth
like
fallen
stars,
and
like
the
stars
there
was
no
end
to
them.
“Count
them
if
you
like,
my
lady,”
Renly
said
quietly.
“You
will
still
be
counting
when
dawn
breaks
in
the
east.
How
many
fires
burn
around
Riverrun
tonight,
I
wonder?”

Catelyn
could
hear
faint
music
drifting
from
the
Great
Hall,
seeping
out
into
the
night.
She
dare
not
count
the
stars.

“I’m
told
your
son
crossed
the
Neck
with
twenty
thousand
swords
at
his
back,”
Renly
went
on.
“Now
that
the
lords
of
the
Trident
are
with
him,
perhaps
he
commands
forty
thousand.”

No,
she
thought,
not
near
so
many,
we
have
lost
men
in
battle,
and
others
to
the
harvest.

“I
have
twice
that
number
here,”
Renly
said,
“and
this
is
only
part
of
my
strength.
Mace
Tyrell
remains
at
Highgarden
with
another
ten
thousand,
I
have
a
strong
garrison
holding
Storm’s
End,
and
soon
enough
the
Dornishmen
will
join
me
with
all
their
power.
And
never
forget
my
brother
Stannis,
who
holds
Dragonstone
and
commands
the
lords
of
the
narrow
sea.”

“It
would
seem
that
you
are
the
one
who
has
forgotten
Stannis,”
Catelyn
said,
more
sharply
than
she’d
intended.

“His
claim,
you
mean?”
Renly
laughed.
“Let
us
be
blunt,
my
lady.
Stannis
would
make
an
appalling
king.
Nor
is
he
like
to
become
one.
Men
respect
Stannis,
even
fear
him,
but
precious
few
have
ever
loved
him.”

“He
is
still
your
elder
brother.
If
either
of
you
can
be
said
to
have
a
right
to
the
Iron
Throne,
it
must
be
Lord
Stannis.”

Renly
shrugged.
“Tell
me,
what
right
did
my
brother
Robert
ever
have
to
the
Iron
Throne?”
He
did
not
wait
for
an
answer.
“Oh,
there
was
talk
of
the
blood
ties
between
Baratheon
and
Targaryen,
of
weddings
a
hundred
years
past,
of
second
sons
and
elder
daughters.
No
one
but
the
maesters
care
about
any
of
it.
Robert
won
the
throne
with
his
warhammer.”
He
swept
a
hand
across
the
campfires
that
burned
from
horizon
to
horizon.
“Well,
there
is
my
claim,
as
good
as
Robert’s
ever
was.
If
your
son
supports
me
as
his
father
supported
Robert,
he’ll
not
find
me
ungenerous.
I
will
gladly
confirm
him
in
all
his
lands,
titles,
and
honors.
He
can
rule
in
Winterfell
as
he
pleases.
He
can
even
go
on
calling
himself
King
in
the
North
if
he
likes,
so
long
as
he
bends
the
knee
and
does
me
homage
as
his
overlord.
King
is
only
a
word,
but
fealty,
loyalty,
service…
those
I
must
have.”

“And
if
he
will
not
give
them
to
you,
my
lord?”

“I
mean
to
be
king,
my
lady,
and
not
of
a
broken
kingdom.
I
cannot
say
it
plainer
than
that.
Three
hundred
years
ago,
a
Stark
king
knelt
to
Aegon
the
Dragon,
when
he
saw
he
could
not
hope
to
prevail.
That
was
wisdom.
Your
son
must
be
wise
as
well.
Once
he
joins
me,
this
war
is
good
as
done.
We—”
Renly
broke
off
suddenly,
distracted.
“What’s
this
now?”

The
rattle
of
chains
heralded
the
raising
of
the
portcullis.
Down
in
the
yard
below,
a
rider
in
a
winged
helm
urged
his
well-lathered
horse
under
the
spikes.
“Summon
the
king!”
he
called.

Renly
vaulted
up
into
a
crenel.
“I’m
here,
ser.”

“Your
Grace.”
The
rider
spurred
his
mount
closer.
“I
came
swift
as
I
could.
From
Storm’s
End.
We
are
besieged,
Your
Grace,
Ser
Cortnay
defies
them,
but…”

“But…
that’s
not
possible.
I
would
have
been
told
if
Lord
Tywin
left
Harrenhal.”

“These
are
no
Lannisters,
my
liege.
It’s
Lord
Stannis
at
your
gates.
King
Stannis,
he
calls
himself
now.”





JON

A
blowing
rain
lashed
at
Jon’s
face
as
he
spurred
his
horse
across
the
swollen
stream.
Beside
him,
Lord
Commander
Mormont
gave
the
hood
of
his
cloak
a
tug,
muttering
curses
on
the
weather.
His
raven
sat
on
his
shoulder,
feathers
ruffled,
as
soaked
and
grumpy
as
the
Old
Bear
himself.
A
gust
of
wind
sent
wet
leaves
flapping
round
them
like
a
flock
of
dead
birds.
The
haunted
forest,
Jon
thought
ruefully.
The
drowned
forest,
more
like
it.

He
hoped
Sam
was
holding
up,
back
down
the
column.
He
was
not
a
good
rider
even
in
fair
weather,
and
six
days
of
rain
had
made
the
ground
treacherous,
all
soft
mud
and
hidden
rocks.
When
the
wind
blew,
it
drove
the
water
right
into
their
eyes.
The
Wall
would
be
flowing
off
to
the
south,
the
melting
ice
mingling
with
warm
rain
to
wash
down
in
sheets
and
rivers.
Pyp
and
Toad
would
be
sitting
near
the
fire
in
the
common
room,
drinking
cups
of
mulled
wine
before
their
supper.
Jon
envied
them.
His
wet
wool
clung
to
him
sodden
and
itching,
his
neck
and
shoulders
ached
fiercely
from
the
weight
of
mail
and
sword,
and
he
was
sick
of
salt
cod,
salt
beef,
and
hard
cheese.

Up
ahead
a
hunting
horn
sounded
a
quavering
note,
half
drowned
beneath
the
constant
patter
of
the
rain.
“Buckwell’s
horn,”
the
Old
Bear
announced.
“The
gods
are
good;
Craster’s
still
there.”
His
raven
gave
a
single
flap
of
his
big
wings,
croaked
“Corn,”
and
ruffled
his
feathers
up
again.

Jon
had
often
heard
the
black
brothers
tell
tales
of
Craster
and
his
keep.
Now
he
would
see
it
with
his
own
eyes.
After
seven
empty
villages,
they
had
all
come
to
dread
finding
Craster’s
as
dead
and
desolate
as
the
rest,
but
it
seemed
they
would
be
spared
that.
Perhaps
the
Old
Bear
will
finally
get
some
answers,
he
thought.
Anyway,
we’ll
be
out
of
the
rain.

Thoren
Smallwood
swore
that
Craster
was
a
friend
to
the
Watch,
despite
his
unsavory
reputation.
“The
man’s
half-mad,
I
won’t
deny
it,”
he’d
told
the
Old
Bear,
“but
you’d
be
the
same
if
you’d
spent
your
life
in
this
cursed
wood.
Even
so,
he’s
never
turned
a
ranger
away
from
his
fire,
nor
does
he
love
Mance
Rayder.
He’ll
give
us
good
counsel.”

So
long
as
he
gives
us
a
hot
meal
and
a
chance
to
dry
our
clothes,
I’ll
be
happy.
Dywen
said
Craster
was
a
kinslayer,
liar,
raper,
and
craven,
and
hinted
that
he
trafficked
with
slavers
and
demons.
“And
worse,”
the
old
forester
would
add,
clacking
his
wooden
teeth.
“There’s
a
cold
smell
to
that
one,
there
is.”

“Jon,”
Lord
Mormont
commanded,
“ride
back
along
the
column
and
spread
the
word.
And
remind
the
officers
that
I
want
no
trouble
about
Craster’s
wives.
The
men
are
to
mind
their
hands
and
speak
to
these
women
as
little
as
need
be.”

“Aye,
my
lord.”
Jon
turned
his
horse
back
the
way
they’d
come.
It
was
pleasant
to
have
the
rain
out
of
his
face,
if
only
for
a
little
while.
Everyone
he
passed
seemed
to
be
weeping.
The
march
was
strung
out
through
half
a
mile
of
woods.

In
the
midst
of
the
baggage
train,
Jon
passed
Samwell
Tarly,
slumped
in
his
saddle
under
a
wide
floppy
hat.
He
was
riding
one
dray
horse
and
leading
the
others.
The
drumming
of
the
rain
against
the
hoods
of
their
cages
had
the
ravens
squawking
and
fluttering.
“You
put
a
fox
in
with
them?”
Jon
called
out.

Water
ran
off
the
brim
of
Sam’s
hat
as
he
lifted
his
head.
“Oh,
hullo,
Jon.
No,
they
just
hate
the
rain,
the
same
as
us.”

“How
are
you
faring,
Sam?”

“Wetly.”
The
fat
boy
managed
a
smile.
“Nothing
has
killed
me
yet,
though.”

“Good.
Craster’s
Keep
is
just
ahead.
If
the
gods
are
good,
he’ll
let
us
sleep
by
his
fire.”

Sam
looked
dubious.
“Dolorous
Edd
says
Craster’s
a
terrible
savage.
He
marries
his
daughters
and
obeys
no
laws
but
those
he
makes
himself.
And
Dywen
told
Grenn
he’s
got
black
blood
in
his
veins.
His
mother
was
a
wildling
woman
who
lay
with
a
ranger,
so
he’s
a
bas…”
Suddenly
he
realized
what
he
was
about
to
say.

“A
bastard,”
Jon
said
with
a
laugh.
“You
can
say
it,
Sam.
I’ve
heard
the
word
before.”
He
put
the
spurs
to
his
surefooted
little
garron.
“I
need
to
hunt
down
Ser
Ottyn.
Be
careful
around
Craster’s
women.”
As
if
Samwell
Tarly
needed
warning
on
that
score.
“We’ll
talk
later,
after
we’ve
made
camp.”

Jon
carried
the
word
back
to
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers,
plodding
along
with
the
rear
guard.
A
small
prune-faced
man
of
an
age
with
Mormont,
Ser
Ottyn
always
looked
tired,
even
at
Castle
Black,
and
the
rain
had
beaten
him
down
unmercifully.
“Welcome
tidings,”
he
said.
“This
wet
has
soaked
my
bones,
and
even
my
saddle
sores
complain
of
saddle
sores.”

On
his
way
back,
Jon
swung
wide
of
the
column’s
line
of
march
and
took
a
shorter
path
through
the
thick
of
the
wood.
The
sounds
of
man
and
horse
diminished,
swallowed
up
by
the
wet
green
wild,
and
soon
enough
he
could
hear
only
the
steady
wash
of
rain
against
leaf
and
tree
and
rock.
It
was
midafternoon,
yet
the
forest
seemed
as
dark
as
dusk.
Jon
wove
a
path
between
rocks
and
puddles,
past
great
oaks,
grey-green
sentinels,
and
black-barked
ironwoods.
In
places
the
branches
wove
a
canopy
overhead
and
he
was
given
a
moment’s
respite
from
the
drumming
of
the
rain
against
his
head.
As
he
rode
past
a
lightning-blasted
chestnut
tree
overgrown
with
wild
white
roses,
he
heard
something
rustling
in
the
underbrush.
“Ghost,”
he
called
out.
“Ghost,
to
me.”

But
it
was
Dywen
who
emerged
from
the
greenery,
forking
a
shaggy
grey
garron
with
Grenn
ahorse
beside
him.
The
Old
Bear
had
deployed
outriders
to
either
side
of
the
main
column,
to
screen
their
march
and
warn
of
the
approach
of
any
enemies,
and
even
there
he
took
no
chances,
sending
the
men
out
in
pairs.

“Ah,
it’s
you,
Lord
Snow.”
Dywen
smiled
an
oaken
smile;
his
teeth
were
carved
of
wood,
and
fit
badly.
“Thought
me
and
the
boy
had
us
one
o’
them
Others
to
deal
with.
Lose
your
wolf?”

“He’s
off
hunting.”
Ghost
did
not
like
to
travel
with
the
column,

DAENERYS

Her
brother
held
the
gown
up
for
her
inspection.
“This
is
beauty.
Touch
it.
Go
on.
Caress
the
fabric.”

Dany
touched
it.
The
cloth
was
so
smooth
that
it
seemed
to
run
through
her
fingers
like
water.
She
could
not
remember
ever
wearing
anything
so
soft.
It
frightened
her.
She
pulled
her
hand
away.
“Is
it
really
mine?”

“A
gift
from
the
Magister
Illyrio,”
Viserys
said,
smiling.
Her
brother
was
in
a
high
mood
tonight.
“The
color
will
bring
out
the
violet
in
your
eyes.
And
you
shall
have
gold
as
well,
and
jewels
of
all
sorts.
Illyrio
has
promised.
Tonight
you
must
look
like
a
princess.”

A
princess,
Dany
thought.
She
had
forgotten
what
that
was
like.
Perhaps
she
had
never
really
known.
“Why
does
he
give
us
so
much?”
she
asked.
“What
does
he
want
from
us?”
For
nigh
on
half
a
year,
they
had
lived
in
the
magister’s
house,
eating
his
food,
pampered
by
his
servants.
Dany
was
thirteen,
old
enough
to
know
that
such
gifts
seldom
come
without
their
price,
here
in
the
free
city
of
Pentos.

“Illyrio
is
no
fool,”
Viserys
said.
He
was
a
gaunt
young
man
with
nervous
hands
and
a
feverish
look
in
his
pale
lilac
eyes.
“The
magister
knows
that
I
will
not
forget
my
friends
when
I
come
into
my
throne.”

Dany
said
nothing.
Magister
Illyrio
was
a
dealer
in
spices,
gemstones,
dragonbone,
and
other,
less
savory
things.
He
had
friends
in
all
of
the
Nine
Free
Cities,
it
was
said,
and
even
beyond,
in
Vaes
Dothrak
and
the
fabled
lands
beside
the
Jade
Sea.
It
was
also
said
that
he’d
never
had
a
friend
he
wouldn’t
cheerfully
sell
for
the
right
price.
Dany
listened
to
the
talk
in
the
streets,
and
she
heard
these
things,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
question
her
brother
when
he
wove
his
webs
of
dream.
His
anger
was
a
terrible
thing
when
roused.
Viserys
called
it
“waking
the
dragon.”

Her
brother
hung
the
gown
beside
the
door.
“Illyrio
will
send
the
slaves
to
bathe
you.
Be
sure
you
wash
off
the
stink
of
the
stables.
Khal
Drogo
has
a
thousand
horses,
tonight
he
looks
for
a
different
sort
of
mount.”
He
studied
her
critically.
“You
still
slouch.
Straighten
yourself”
He
pushed
back
her
shoulders
with
his
hands.
“Let
them
see
that
you
have
a
woman’s
shape
now.”
His
fingers
brushed
lightly
over
her
budding
breasts
and
tightened
on
a
nipple.
“You
will
not
fail
me
tonight.
If
you
do,
it
will
go
hard
for
you.
You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”
His
fingers
twisted
her,
the
pinch
cruelly
hard
through
the
rough
fabric
of
her
tunic.
“Do
you?”
he
repeated.

“No,”
Dany
said
meekly.

Her
brother
smiled.
“Good.”
He
touched
her
hair,
almost
with
affection.
“When
they
write
the
history
of
my
reign,
sweet
sister,
they
will
say
that
it
began
tonight.”

When
he
was
gone,
Dany
went
to
her
window
and
looked
out
wistfully
on
the
waters
of
the
bay.
The
square
brick
towers
of
Pentos
were
black
silhouettes
outlined
against
the
setting
sun.
Dany
could
hear
the
singing
of
the
red
priests
as
they
lit
their
night
fires
and
the
shouts
of
ragged
children
playing
games
beyond
the
walls
of
the
estate.
For
a
moment
she
wished
she
could
be
out
there
with
them,
barefoot
and
breathless
and
dressed
in
tatters,
with
no
past
and
no
future
and
no
feast
to
attend
at
Khal
Drogo’s
manse.

Somewhere
beyond
the
sunset,
across
the
narrow
sea,
lay
a
land
of
green
hills
and
flowered
plains
and
great
rushing
rivers,
where
towers
of
dark
stone
rose
amidst
magnificent
blue-grey
mountains,
and
armored
knights
rode
to
battle
beneath
the
banners
of
their
lords.
The
Dothraki
called
that
land
Rhaesh
Andahli,
the
land
of
the
Andals.
In
the
Free
Cities,
they
talked
of
Westeros
and
the
Sunset
Kingdoms.
Her
brother
had
a
simpler
name.
“Our
land,”
he
called
it.
The
words
were
like
a
prayer
with
him.
If
he
said
them
enough,
the
gods
were
sure
to
hear.
“Ours
by
blood
right,
taken
from
us
by
treachery,
but
ours
still,
ours
forever.
You
do
not
steal
from
the
dragon,
oh,
no.
The
dragon
remembers.”

And
perhaps
the
dragon
did
remember,
but
Dany
could
not.
She
had
never
seen
this
land
her
brother
said
was
theirs,
this
realm
beyond
the
narrow
sea.
These
places
he
talked
of,
Casterly
Rock
and
the
Eyrie,
Highgarden
and
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
Dorne
and
the
Isle
of
Faces,
they
were
just
words
to
her.
Viserys
had
been
a
boy
of
eight
when
they
fled
King’s
Landing
to
escape
the
advancing
armies
of
the
Usurper,
but
Daenerys
had
been
only
a
quickening
in
their
mother’s
womb.

Yet
sometimes
Dany
would
picture
the
way
it
had
been,
so
often
had
her
brother
told
her
the
stories.
The
midnight
flight
to
Dragonstone,
moonlight
shimmering
on
the
ship’s
black
sails.
Her
brother
Rhaegar
battling
the
Usurper
in
the
bloody
waters
of
the
Trident
and
dying
for
the
woman
he
loved.
The
sack
of
King’s
Landing
by
the
ones
Viserys
called
the
Usurper’s
dogs,
the
lords
Lannister
and
Stark.
Princess
Elia
of
Dorne
pleading
for
mercy
as
Rhaegar’s
heir
was
ripped
from
her
breast
and
murdered
before
her
eyes.
The
polished
skulls
of
the
last
dragons
staring
down
sightlessly
from
the
walls
of
the
throne
room
while
the
Kingslayer
opened
Father’s
throat
with
a
golden
sword.

She
had
been
born
on
Dragonstone
nine
moons
after
their
flight,
while
a
raging
summer
storm
threatened
to
rip
the
island
fastness
apart.
They
said
that
storm
was
terrible.
The
Targaryen
fleet
was
smashed
while
it
lay
at
anchor,
and
huge
stone
blocks
were
ripped
from
the
parapets
and
sent
hurtling
into
the
wild
waters
of
the
narrow
sea.
Her
mother
had
died
birthing
her,
and
for
that
her
brother
Viserys
had
never
forgiven
her.

She
did
not
remember
Dragonstone
either.
They
had
run
again,
just
before
the
Usurper’s
brother
set
sail
with
his
new-built
fleet.
By
then
only
Dragonstone
itself,
the
ancient
seat
of
their
House,
had
remained
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
that
had
once
been
theirs.
It
would
not
remain
for
long.
The
garrison
had
been
prepared
to
sell
them
to
the
Usurper,
but
one
night
Ser
Willem
Darry
and
four
loyal
men
had
broken
into
the
nursery
and
stolen
them
both,
along
with
her
wet
nurse,
and
set
sail
under
cover
of
darkness
for
the
safety
of
the
Braavosian
coast.

She
remembered
Ser
Willem
dimly,
a
great
grey
bear
of
a
man,
half-blind,
roaring
and
bellowing
orders
from
his
sickbed.
The
servants
had
lived
in
terror
of
him,
but
he
had
always
been
kind
to
Dany.
He
called
her
“Little
Princess”
and
sometimes
“My
Lady,”
and
his
hands
were
soft
as
old
leather.
He
never
left
his
bed,
though,
and
the
smell
of
sickness
clung
to
him
day
and
night,
a
hot,
moist,
sickly
sweet
odor.
That
was
when
they
lived
in
Braavos,
in
the
big
house
with
the
red
door.
Dany
had
her
own
room
there,
with
a
lemon
tree
outside
her
window.
After
Ser
Willem
had
died,
the
servants
had
stolen
what
little
money
they
had
left,
and
soon
after
they
had
been
put
out
of
the
big
house.
Dany
had
cried
when
the
red
door
closed
behind
them
forever.

They
had
wandered
since
then,
from
Braavos
to
Myr,
from
Myr
to
Tyrosh,
and
on
to
Qohor
and
Volantis
and
Lys,
never
staying
long
in
any
one
place.
Her
brother
would
not
allow
it.
The
Usurper’s
hired
knives
were
close
behind
them,
he
insisted,
though
Dany
had
never
seen
one.

At
first
the
magisters
and
archons
and
merchant
princes
were
pleased
to
welcome
the
last
Targaryens
to
their
homes
and
tables,
but
as
the
years
passed
and
the
Usurper
continued
to
sit
upon
the
Iron
Throne,
doors
closed
and
their
lives
grew
meaner.
Years
past
they
had
been
forced
to
sell
their
last
few
treasures,
and
now
even
the
coin
they
had
gotten
from
Mother’s
crown
had
gone.
In
the
alleys
and
wine
sinks
of
Pentos,
they
called
her
brother
“the
beggar
king.”
Dany
did
not
want
to
know
what
they
called
her.

“We
will
have
it
all
back
someday,
sweet
sister,”
he
would
promise
her.
Sometimes
his
hands
shook
when
he
talked
about
it.
“The
jewels
and
the
silks,
Dragonstone
and
King’s
Landing,
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
all
they
have
taken
from
us,
we
will
have
it
back.”
Viserys
lived
for
that
day.
All
that
Daenerys
wanted
back
was
the
big
house
with
the
red
door,
the
lemon
tree
outside
her
window,
the
childhood
she
had
never
known.

There
came
a
soft
knock
on
her
door.
“Come,”
Dany
said,
turning
away
from
the
window.
Illyrio’s
servants
entered,
bowed,
and
set
about
their
business.
They
were
slaves,
a
gift
from
one
of
the
magister’s
many
Dothraki
friends.
There
was
no
slavery
in
the
free
city
of
Pentos.
Nonetheless,
they
were
slaves.
The
old
woman,
small
and
grey
as
a
mouse,
never
said
a
word,
but
the
girl
made
up
for
it.
She
was
Illyrio’s
favorite,
a
fair-haired,
blue-eyed
wench
of
sixteen
who
chattered
constantly
as
she
worked.

They
filled
her
bath
with
hot
water
brought
up
from
the
kitchen
and
scented
it
with
fragrant
oils.
The
girl
pulled
the
rough
cotton
tunic
over
Dany’s
head
and
helped
her
into
the
tub.
The
water
was
scalding
hot,
but
Daenerys
did
not
flinch
or
cry
out.
She
liked
the
heat.
It
made
her
feel
clean.
Besides,
her
brother
had
often
told
her
that
it
was
never
too
hot
for
a
Targaryen.
“Ours
is
the
house
of
the
dragon,”
he
would
say.
“The
fire
is
in
our
blood.”

The
old
woman
washed
her
long,
silver-pale
hair
and
gently
combed
out
the
snags,
all
in
silence.
The
girl
scrubbed
her
back
and
her
feet
and
told
her
how
lucky
she
was.
“Drogo
is
so
rich
that
even
his
slaves
wear
golden
collars.
A
hundred
thousand
men
ride
in
his
khalasar,
and
his
palace
in
Vaes
Dothrak
has
two
hundred
rooms
and
doors
of
solid
silver.”
There
was
more
like
that,
so
much
more,
what
a
handsome
man
the
khal
was,
so
tall
and
fierce,
fearless
in
battle,
the
best
rider
ever
to
mount
a
horse,
a
demon
archer.
Daenerys
said
nothing.
She
had
always
assumed
that
she
would
wed
Viserys
when
she
came
of
age.
For
centuries
the
Targaryens
had
married
brother
to
sister,
since
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
taken
his
sisters
to
bride.
The
line
must
be
kept
pure,
Viserys
had
told
her
a
thousand
times;
theirs
was
the
kingsblood,
the
golden
blood
of
old
Valyria,
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
Dragons
did
not
mate
with
the
beasts
of
the
field,
and
Targaryens
did
not
mingle
their
blood
with
that
of
lesser
men.
Yet
now
Viserys
schemed
to
sell
her
to
a
stranger,
a
barbarian.

When
she
was
clean,
the
slaves
helped
her
from
the
water
and
toweled
her
dry.
The
girl
brushed
her
hair
until
it
shone
like
molten
silver,
while
the
old
woman
anointed
her
with
the
spiceflower
perfume
of
the
Dothraki
plains,
a
dab
on
each
wrist,
behind
her
ears,
on
the
tips
of
her
breasts,
and
one
last
one,
cool
on
her
lips,
down
there
between
her
legs.
They
dressed
her
in
the
wisps
that
Magister
Illyrio
had
sent
up,
and
then
the
gown,
a
deep
plum
silk
to
bring
out
the
violet
in
her
eyes.
The
girl
slid
the
gilded
sandals
onto
her
feet,
while
the
old
woman
fixed
the
tiara
in
her
hair,
and
slid
golden
bracelets
crusted
with
amethysts
around
her
wrists.
Last
of
all
came
the
collar,
a
heavy
golden
torc
emblazoned
with
ancient
Valyrian
glyphs.

“Now
you
look
all
a
princess,”
the
girl
said
breathlessly
when
they
were
done.
Dany
glanced
at
her
image
in
the
silvered
looking
glass
that
Illyrio
had
so
thoughtfully
provided.
A
princess,
she
thought,
but
she
remembered
what
the
girl
had
said,
how
Khal
Drogo
was
so
rich
even
his
slaves
wore
golden
collars.
She
felt
a
sudden
chill,
and
gooseflesh
pimpled
her
bare
arms.

Her
brother
was
waiting
in
the
cool
of
the
entry
hall,
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
pool,
his
hand
trailing
in
the
water.
He
rose
when
she
appeared
and
looked
her
over
critically.
“Stand
there,”
he
told
her.
“Turn
around.
Yes.
Good.
You
look…”

“Regal,”
Magister
Illyrio
said,
stepping
through
an
archway.
He
moved
with
surprising
delicacy
for
such
a
massive
man.
Beneath
loose
garments
of
flame-colored
silk,
rolls
of
fat
jiggled
as
he
walked.
Gemstones
glittered
on
every
finger,
and
his
man
had
oiled
his
forked
yellow
beard
until
it
shone
like
real
gold.
“May
the
Lord
of
Light
shower
you
with
blessings
on
this
most
fortunate
day,
Princess
Daenerys,”
the
magister
said
as
he
took
her
hand.
He
bowed
his
head,
showing
a
thin
glimpse
of
crooked
yellow
teeth
through
the
gold
of
his
beard.
“She
is
a
vision,
Your
Grace,
a
vision,”
he
told
her
brother.
“Drogo
will
be
enraptured.”

“She’s
too
skinny,”
Viserys
said.
His
hair,
the
same
silver-blond
as
hers,
had
been
pulled
back
tightly
behind
his
head
and
fastened
with
a
dragonbone
brooch.
It
was
a
severe
look
that
emphasized
the
hard,
gaunt
lines
of
his
face.
He
rested
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword
that
Illyrio
had
lent
him,
and
said,
“Are
you
sure
that
Khal
Drogo
likes
his
women
this
young?”

“She
has
had
her
blood.
She
is
old
enough
for
the
khal,”
Illyrio
told
him,
not
for
the
first
time.
“Look
at
her.
That
silver-gold
hair,
those
purple
eyes…
she
is
the
blood
of
old
Valyria,
no
doubt,
no
doubt…
and
highborn,
daughter
of
the
old
king,
sister
to
the
new,
she
cannot
fail
to
entrance
our
Drogo.”
When
he
released
her
hand,
Daenerys
found
herself
trembling.

“I
suppose,”
her
brother
said
doubtfully.
“The
savages
have
queer
tastes.
Boys,
horses,
sheep…”

“Best
not
suggest
this
to
Khal
Drogo,”
Illyrio
said.

Anger
flashed
in
her
brother’s
lilac
eyes.
“Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?”

The
magister
bowed
slightly.
“I
take
you
for
a
king.
Kings
lack
the
caution
of
common
men.
My
apologies
if
I
have
given
offense.”
He
turned
away
and
clapped
his
hands
for
his
bearers.

The
streets
of
Pentos
were
pitch-dark
when
they
set
out
in
Illyrio’s
elaborately
carved
palanquin.
Two
servants
went
ahead
to
light
their
way,
carrying
ornate
oil
lanterns
with
panes
of
pale
blue
glass,
while
a
dozen
strong
men
hoisted
the
poles
to
their
shoulders.
It
was
warm
and
close
inside
behind
the
curtains.
Dany
could
smell
the
stench
of
Illyrio’s
pallid
flesh
through
his
heavy
perfumes.

Her
brother,
sprawled
out
on
his
pillows
beside
her,
never
noticed.
His
mind
was
away
across
the
narrow
sea.
“We
won’t
need
his
whole
khalasar,”
Viserys
said.
His
fingers
toyed
with
the
hilt
of
his
borrowed
blade,
though
Dany
knew
he
had
never
used
a
sword
in
earnest.
“Ten
thousand,
that
would
be
enough,
I
could
sweep
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
ten
thousand
Dothraki
screamers.
The
realm
will
rise
for
its
rightful
king.
Tyrell,
Redwyne,
Darry,
Greyjoy,
they
have
no
more
love
for
the
Usurper
than
I
do.
The
Dornishmen
burn
to
avenge
Elia
and
her
children.
And
the
smallfolk
will
be
with
us.
They
cry
out
for
their
king.”
He
looked
at
Illyrio
anxiously.
“They
do,
don’t
they?”

“They
are
your
people,
and
they
love
you
well,”
Magister
Illyrio
said
amiably.
“In
holdfasts
all
across
the
realm,
men
lift
secret
toasts
to
your
health
while
women
sew
dragon
banners
and
hide
them
against
the
day
of
your
return
from
across
the
water.”
He
gave
a
massive
shrug.
“Or
so
my
agents
tell
me.”

Dany
had
no
agents,
no
way
of
knowing
what
anyone
was
doing
or
thinking
across
the
narrow
sea,
but
she
mistrusted
Illyrio’s
sweet
words
as
she
mistrusted
everything
about
Illyrio.
Her
brother
was
nodding
eagerly,
however.
“I
shall
kill
the
Usurper
myself,”
he
promised,
who
had
never
killed
anyone,
“as
he
killed
my
brother
Rhaegar.
And
Lannister
too,
the
Kingslayer,
for
what
he
did
to
my
father.”

“That
would
be
most
fitting,”
Magister
Illyrio
said.
Dany
saw
the
smallest
hint
of
a
smile
playing
around
his
full
lips,
but
her
brother
did
not
notice.
Nodding,
he
pushed
back
a
curtain
and
stared
off
into
the
night,
and
Dany
knew
he
was
fighting
the
Battle
of
the
Trident
once
again.

The
nine-towered
manse
of
Khal
Drogo
sat
beside
the
waters
of
the
bay,
its
high
brick
walls
overgrown
with
pale
ivy.
It
had
been
given
to
the
khal
by
the
magisters
of
Pentos,
Illyrio
told
them.
The
Free
Cities
were
always
generous
with
the
horselords.
“It
is
not
that
we
fear
these
barbarians,”
Illyrio
would
explain
with
a
smile.
“The
Lord
of
Light
would
hold
our
city
walls
against
a
million
Dothraki,
or
so
the
red
priests
promise…
yet
why
take
chances,
when
their
friendship
comes
so
cheap?”

Their
palanquin
was
stopped
at
the
gate,
the
curtains
pulled
roughly
back
by
one
of
the
house
guards.
He
had
the
copper
skin
and
dark
almond
eyes
of
a
Dothraki,
but
his
face
was
hairless
and
he
wore
the
spiked
bronze
cap
of
the
Unsullied.
He
looked
them
over
coldly.
Magister
Illyrio
growled
something
to
him
in
the
rough
Dothraki
tongue;
the
guardsman
replied
in
the
same
voice
and
waved
them
through
the
gates.

Dany
noticed
that
her
brother’s
hand
was
clenched
tightly
around
the
hilt
of
his
borrowed
sword.
He
looked
almost
as
frightened
as
she
felt.
“Insolent
eunuch,”
Viserys
muttered
as
the
palanquin
lurched
up
toward
the
manse.

Magister
Illyrio’s
words
were
honey.
“Many
important
men
will
be
at
the
feast
tonight.
Such
men
have
enemies.
The
khal
must
protect
his
guests,
yourself
chief
among
them,
Your
Grace.
No
doubt
the
Usurper
would
pay
well
for
your
head.”

“Oh,
yes,”
Viserys
said
darkly.
“He
has
tried,
Illyrio,
I
promise
you
that.
His
hired
knives
follow
us
everywhere.
I
am
the
last
dragon,
and
he
will
not
sleep
easy
while
I
live.”

The
palanquin
slowed
and
stopped.
The
curtains
were
thrown
back,
and
a
slave
offered
a
hand
to
help
Daenerys
out.
His
collar,
she
noted,
was
ordinary
bronze.
Her
brother
followed,
one
hand
still
clenched
hard
around
his
sword
hilt.
It
took
two
strong
men
to
get
Magister
Illyrio
back
on
his
feet.

Inside
the
manse,
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
spices,
pinchfire
and
sweet
lemon
and
cinnamon.
They
were
escorted
across
the
entry
hall,
where
a
mosaic
of
colored
glass
depicted
the
Doom
of
Valyria.
Oil
burned
in
black
iron
lanterns
all
along
the
walls.
Beneath
an
arch
of
twining
stone
leaves,
a
eunuch
sang
their
coming.
“Viserys
of
the
House
Targaryen,
the
Third
of
his
Name,”
he
called
in
a
high,
sweet
voice,
“King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
His
sister,
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Princess
of
Dragonstone.
His
honorable
host,
Illyrio
Mopatis,
Magister
of
the
Free
City
of
Pentos.”

They
stepped
past
the
eunuch
into
a
pillared
courtyard
overgrown
in
pale
ivy.
Moonlight
painted
the
leaves
in
shades
of
bone
and
silver
as
the
guests
drifted
among
them.
Many
were
Dothraki
horselords,
big
men
with
red-brown
skin,
their
drooping
mustachios
bound
in
metal
rings,
their
black
hair
oiled
and
braided
and
hung
with
bells.
Yet
among
them
moved
bravos
and
sellswords
from
Pentos
and
Myr
and
Tyrosh,
a
red
priest
even
fatter
than
Illyrio,
hairy
men
from
the
Port
of
Ibben,
and
lords
from
the
Summer
Isles
with
skin
as
black
as
ebony.
Daenerys
looked
at
them
all
in
wonder…
and
realized,
with
a
sudden
start
of
fear,
that
she
was
the
only
woman
there.

Illyrio
whispered
to
them.
“Those
three
are
Drogo’s
bloodriders,
there,”
he
said.
“By
the
pillar
is
Khal
Moro,
with
his
son
Rhogoro.
The
man
with
the
green
beard
is
brother
to
the
Archon
of
Tyrosh,
and
the
man
behind
him
is
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.”

The
last
name
caught
Daenerys.
“A
knight?”

“No
less.”
Illyrio
smiled
through
his
beard.
“Anointed
with
the
seven
oils
by
the
High
Septon
himself.”

“What
is
he
doing
here?”
she
blurted.

“The
Usurper
wanted
his
head,”
Illyrio
told
them.
“Some
trifling
affront.
He
sold
some
poachers
to
a
Tyroshi
slaver
instead
of
giving
them
to
the
Night’s
Watch.
Absurd
law.
A
man
should
be
able
to
do
as
he
likes
with
his
own
chattel.”

“I
shall
wish
to
speak
with
Ser
Jorah
before
the
night
is
done,”
her
brother
said.
Dany
found
herself
looking
at
the
knight
curiously.
He
was
an
older
man,
past
forty
and
balding,
but
still
strong
and
fit.
Instead
of
silks
and
cottons,
he
wore
wool
and
leather.
His
tunic
was
a
dark
green,
embroidered
with
the
likeness
of
a
black
bear
standing
on
two
legs.

She
was
still
looking
at
this
strange
man
from
the
homeland
she
had
never
known
when
Magister
Illyrio
placed
a
moist
hand
on
her
bare
shoulder.
“Over
there,
sweet
princess,”
he
whispered,
“there
is
the
khal
himself.”

Dany
wanted
to
run
and
hide,
but
her
brother
was
looking
at
her,
and
if
she
displeased
him
she
knew
she
would
wake
the
dragon.
Anxiously,
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
man
Viserys
hoped
would
ask
to
wed
her
before
the
night
was
done.

The
slave
girl
had
not
been
far
wrong,
she
thought.
Khal
Drogo
was
a
head
taller
than
the
tallest
man
in
the
room,
yet
somehow
light
on
his
feet,
as
graceful
as
the
panther
in
Illyrio’s
menagerie.
He
was
younger
than
she’d
thought,
no
more
than
thirty.
His
skin
was
the
color
of
polished
copper,
his
thick
mustachios
bound
with
gold
and
bronze
rings.

“I
must
go
and
make
my
submissions,”
Magister
Illyrio
said.
“Wait
here.
I
shall
bring
him
to
you.”

Her
brother
took
her
by
the
arm
as
Illyrio
waddled
over
to
the
khal,
his
fingers
squeezing
so
hard
that
they
hurt.
“Do
you
see
his
braid,
sweet
sister?”

Drogo’s
braid
was
black
as
midnight
and
heavy
with
scented
oil,
hung
with
tiny
bells
that
rang
softly
as
he
moved.
It
swung
well
past
his
belt,
below
even
his
buttocks,
the
end
of
it
brushing
against
the
back
of
his
thighs.

“You
see
how
long
it
is?”
Viserys
said.
“When
Dothraki
are
defeated
in
combat,
they
cut
off
their
braids
in
disgrace,
so
the
world
will
know
their
shame.
Khal
Drogo
has
never
lost
a
fight.
He
is
Aegon
the
Dragonlord
come
again,
and
you
will
be
his
queen.”

Dany
looked
at
Khal
Drogo.
His
face
was
hard
and
cruel,
his
eyes
as
cold
and
dark
as
onyx.
Her
brother
hurt
her
sometimes,
when
she
woke
the
dragon,
but
he
did
not
frighten
her
the
way
this
man
frightened
her.
“I
don’t
want
to
be
his
queen,”
she
heard
herself
say
in
a
small,
thin
voice.
“Please,
please,
Viserys,
I
don’t
want
to,
I
want
to
go
home.”

“Home?”
He
kept
his
voice
low,
but
she
could
hear
the
fury
in
his
tone.
“How
are
we
to
go
home,
sweet
sister?
They
took
our
home
from
us!”
He
drew
her
into
the
shadows,
out
of
sight,
his
fingers
digging
into
her
skin.
“How
are
we
to
go
home?”
he
repeated,
meaning
King’s
Landing,
and
Dragonstone,
and
all
the
realm
they
had
lost.

Dany
had
only
meant
their
rooms
in
Illyrio’s
estate,
no
true
home
surely,
though
all
they
had,
but
her
brother
did
not
want
to
hear
that.
There
was
no
home
there
for
him.
Even
the
big
house
with
the
red
door
had
not
been
home
for
him.
His
fingers
dug
hard
into
her
arm,
demanding
an
answer.
“I
don’t
know…”she
said
at
last,
her
voice
breaking.
Tears
welled
in
her
eyes.

“I
do,”
he
said
sharply.
“We
go
home
with
an
army,
sweet
sister.
With
Khal
Drogo’s
army,
that
is
how
we
go
home.
And
if
you
must
wed
him
and
bed
him
for
that,
you
will.”
He
smiled
at
her.
“I’d
let
his
whole
khalasar
fuck
you
if
need
be,
sweet
sister,
all
forty
thousand
men,
and
their
horses
too
if
that
was
what
it
took
to
get
my
army.
Be
grateful
it
is
only
Drogo.
In
time
you
may
even
learn
to
like
him.
Now
dry
your
eyes.
Illyrio
is
bringing
him
over,
and
he
will
not
see
you
crying.”

Dany
turned
and
saw
that
it
was
true.
Magister
Illyrio,
all
smiles
and
bows,
was
escorting
Khal
Drogo
over
to
where
they
stood.
She
brushed
away
unfallen
tears
with
the
back
of
her
hand.

“Smile,”
Viserys
whispered
nervously,
his
hand
failing
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
“And
stand
up
straight.
Let
him
see
that
you
have
breasts.
Gods
know,
you
have
little
enough
as
is.”

Daenerys
smiled,
and
stood
up
straight.





EDDARD

The
visitors
poured
through
the
castle
gates
in
a
river
of
gold
and
silver
and
polished
steel,
three
hundred
strong,
a
pride
of
bannermen
and
knights,
of
sworn
swords
and
freeriders.
Over
their
heads
a
dozen
golden
banners
whipped
back
and
forth
in
the
northern
wind,
emblazoned
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon.

Ned
knew
many
of
the
riders.
There
came
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
with
hair
as
bright
as
beaten
gold,
and
there
Sandor
Clegane
with
his
terrible
burned
face.
The
tall
boy
beside
him
could
only
be
the
crown
prince,
and
that
stunted
little
man
behind
them
was
surely
the
Imp,
Tyrion
Lannister.

Yet
the
huge
man
at
the
head
of
the
column,
flanked
by
two
knights
in
the
snow-white
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard,
seemed
almost
a
stranger
to
Ned…
until
he
vaulted
off
the
back
of
his
warhorse
with
a
familiar
roar,
and
crushed
him
in
a
bone-crunching
hug.
“Ned!
Ah,
but
it
is
good
to
see
that
frozen
face
of
yours.”
The
king
looked
him
over
top
to
bottom,
and
laughed.
“You
have
not
changed
at
all.”

Would
that
Ned
had
been
able
to
say
the
same.
Fifteen
years
past,
when
they
had
ridden
forth
to
win
a
throne,
the
Lord
of
Storm’s
End
had
been
clean-shaven,
clear-eyed,
and
muscled
like
a
maiden’s
fantasy.
Six
and
a
half
feet
tall,
he
towered
over
lesser
men,
and
when
he
donned
his
armor
and
the
great
antlered
helmet
of
his
House,
he
became
a
veritable
giant.
He’d
had
a
giant’s
strength
too,
his
weapon
of
choice
a
spiked
iron
warhammer
that
Ned
could
scarcely
lift.
In
those
days,
the
smell
of
leather
and
blood
had
clung
to
him
like
perfume.

Now
it
was
perfume
that
clung
to
him
like
perfume,
and
he
had
a
girth
to
match
his
height.
Ned
had
last
seen
the
king
nine
years
before
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion,
when
the
stag
and
the
direwolf
had
joined
to
end
the
pretensions
of
the
self-proclaimed
King
of
the
Iron
Islands.
Since
the
night
they
had
stood
side
by
side
in
Greyjoy’s
fallen
stronghold,
where
Robert
had
accepted
the
rebel
lord’s
surrender
and
Ned
had
taken
his
son
Theon
as
hostage
and
ward,
the
king
had
gained
at
least
eight
stone.
A
beard
as
coarse
and
black
as
iron
wire
covered
his
jaw
to
hide
his
double
chin
and
the
sag
of
the
royal
jowls,
but
nothing
could
hide
his
stomach
or
the
dark
circles
under
his
eyes.

Yet
Robert
was
Ned’s
king
now,
and
not
just
a
friend,
so
he
said
only,
“Your
Grace.
Winterfell
is
yours.”

By
then
the
others
were
dismounting
as
well,
and
grooms
were
coming
forward
for
their
mounts.
Robert’s
queen,
Cersei
Lannister,
entered
on
foot
with
her
younger
children.
The
wheelhouse
in
which
they
had
ridden,
a
huge
double-decked
carriage
of
oiled
oak
and
gilded
metal
pulled
by
forty
heavy
draft
horses,
was
too
wide
to
pass
through
the
castle
gate.
Ned
knelt
in
the
snow
to
kiss
the
queen’s
ring,
while
Robert
embraced
Catelyn
like
a
long-lost
sister.
Then
the
children
had
been
brought
forward,
introduced,
and
approved
of
by
both
sides.

No
sooner
had
those
formalities
of
greeting
been
completed
than
the
king
had
said
to
his
host,
“Take
me
down
to
your
crypt,
Eddard.
I
would
pay
my
respects.”

Ned
loved
him
for
that,
for
remembering
her
still
after
all
these
years.
He
called
for
a
lantern.
No
other
words
were
needed.
The
queen
had
begun
to
protest.
They
had
been
riding
since
dawn,
everyone
was
tired
and
cold,
surely
they
should
refresh
themselves
first.
The
dead
would
wait.
She
had
said
no
more
than
that;
Robert
had
looked
at
her,
and
her
twin
brother
Jaime
had
taken
her
quietly
by
the
arm,
and
she
had
said
no
more.

They
went
down
to
the
crypt
together,
Ned
and
this
king
he
scarcely
recognized.
The
winding
stone
steps
were
narrow.
Ned
went
first
with
the
lantern.
“I
was
starting
to
think
we
would
never
reach
Winterfell,”
Robert
complained
as
they
descended.
“In
the
south,
the
way
they
talk
about
my
Seven
Kingdoms,
a
man
forgets
that
your
part
is
as
big
as
the
other
six
combined.”

“I
trust
you
enjoyed
the
journey,
Your
Grace?”

Robert
snorted.
“Bogs
and
forests
and
fields,
and
scarcely
a
decent
inn
north
of
the
Neck.
I’ve
never
seen
such
a
vast
emptiness.
Where
are
all
your
people?”

“Likely
they
were
too
shy
to
come
out,”
Ned
jested.
He
could
feel
the
chill
coming
up
the
stairs,
a
cold
breath
from
deep
within
the
earth.
“Kings
are
a
rare
sight
in
the
north.”

Robert
snorted.
“More
likely
they
were
hiding
under
the
snow.
Snow,
Ned!”
The
king
put
one
hand
on
the
wall
to
steady
himself
as
they
descended.

“Late
summer
snows
are
common
enough,”
Ned
said.
“I
hope
they
did
not
trouble
you.
They
are
usually
mild.”

“The
Others
take
your
mild
snows,”
Robert
swore.
“What
will
this
place
be
like
in
winter?
I
shudder
to
think.”

“The
winters
are
hard,”
Ned
admitted.
“But
the
Starks
will
endure.
We
always
have.”

“You
need
to
come
south,”
Robert
told
him.
“You
need
a
taste
of
summer
before
it
flees.
In
Highgarden
there
are
fields
of
golden
roses
that
stretch
away
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see.
The
fruits
are
so
ripe
they
explode
in
your
mouth—melons,
peaches,
fireplums,
you’ve
never
tasted
such
sweetness.
You’ll
see,
I
brought
you
some.
Even
at
Storm’s
End,
with
that
good
wind
off
the
bay,
the
days
are
so
hot
you
can
barely
move.
And
you
ought
to
see
the
towns,
Ned!
Flowers
everywhere,
the
markets
bursting
with
food,
the
summerwines
so
cheap
and
so
good
that
you
can
get
drunk
just
breathing
the
air.
Everyone
is
fat
and
drunk
and
rich.”
He
laughed
and
slapped
his
own
ample
stomach
a
thump.
“And
the
girls,
Ned!”
he
exclaimed,
his
eyes
sparkling.
“I
swear,
women
lose
all
modesty
in
the
heat.
They
swim
naked
in
the
river,
right
beneath
the
castle.
Even
in
the
streets,
it’s
too
damn
hot
for
wool
or
fur,
so
they
go
around
in
these
short
gowns,
silk
if
they
have
the
silver
and
cotton
if
not,
but
it’s
all
the
same
when
they
start
sweating
and
the
cloth
sticks
to
their
skin,
they
might
as
well
be
naked.”
The
king
laughed
happily.

Robert
Baratheon
had
always
been
a
man
of
huge
appetites,
a
man
who
knew
how
to
take
his
pleasures.
That
was
not
a
charge
anyone
could
lay
at
the
door
of
Eddard
Stark.
Yet
Ned
could
not
help
but
notice
that
those
pleasures
were
taking
a
toll
on
the
king.
Robert
was
breathing
heavily
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
his
face
red
in
the
lantern
light
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
crypt.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
said
respectfully.
He
swept
the
lantern
in
a
wide
semicircle.
Shadows
moved
and
lurched.
Flickering
light
touched
the
stones
underfoot
and
brushed
against
a
long
procession
of
granite
pillars
that
marched
ahead,
two
by
two,
into
the
dark.
Between
the
pillars,
the
dead
sat
on
their
stone
thrones
against
the
walls,
backs
against
the
sepulchres
that
contained
their
mortal
remains.
“She
is
down
at
the
end,
with
Father
and
Brandon.”

He
led
the
way
between
the
pillars
and
Robert
followed
wordlessly,
shivering
in
the
subterranean
chill.
It
was
always
cold
down
here.
Their
footsteps
rang
off
the
stones
and
echoed
in
the
vault
overhead
as
they
walked
among
the
dead
of
House
Stark.
The
Lords
of
Winterfell
watched
them
pass.
Their
likenesses
were
carved
into
the
stones
that
sealed
the
tombs.
In
long
rows
they
sat,
blind
eyes
staring
out
into
eternal
darkness,
while
great
stone
direwolves
curled
round
their
feet.
The
shifting
shadows
made
the
stone
figures
seem
to
stir
as
the
living
passed
by.

By
ancient
custom
an
iron
longsword
had
been
laid
across
the
lap
of
each
who
had
been
Lord
of
Winterfell,
to
keep
the
vengeful
spirits
in
their
crypts.
The
oldest
had
long
ago
rusted
away
to
nothing,
leaving
only
a
few
red
stains
where
the
metal
had
rested
on
stone.
Ned
wondered
if
that
meant
those
ghosts
were
free
to
roam
the
castle
now.
He
hoped
not.
The
first
Lords
of
Winterfell
had
been
men
hard
as
the
land
they
ruled.
In
the
centuries
before
the
Dragonlords
came
over
the
sea,
they
had
sworn
allegiance
to
no
man,
styling
themselves
the
Kings
in
the
North.

Ned
stopped
at
last
and
lifted
the
oil
lantern.
The
crypt
continued
on
into
darkness
ahead
of
them,
but
beyond
this
point
the
tombs
were
empty
and
unsealed;
black
holes
waiting
for
their
dead,
waiting
for
him
and
his
children.
Ned
did
not
like
to
think
on
that.
“Here,”
he
told
his
king.

Robert
nodded
silently,
knelt,
and
bowed
his
head.

There
were
three
tombs,
side
by
side.
Lord
Rickard
Stark,
Ned’s
father,
had
a
long,
stern
face.
The
stonemason
had
known
him
well.
He
sat
with
quiet
dignity,
stone
fingers
holding
tight
to
the
sword
across
his
lap,
but
in
life
all
swords
had
failed
him.
In
two
smaller
sepulchres
on
either
side
were
his
children.

Brandon
had
been
twenty
when
he
died,
strangled
by
order
of
the
Mad
King
Aerys
Targaryen
only
a
few
short
days
before
he
was
to
wed
Catelyn
Tully
of
Riverrun.
His
father
had
been
forced
to
watch
him
die.
He
was
the
true
heir,
the
eldest,
born
to
rule.

Lyanna
had
only
been
sixteen,
a
child-woman
of
surpassing
loveliness.
Ned
had
loved
her
with
all
his
heart.
Robert
had
loved
her
even
more.
She
was
to
have
been
his
bride.

“She
was
more
beautiful
than
that,”
the
king
said
after
a
silence.
His
eyes
lingered
on
Lyanna’s
face,
as
if
he
could
will
her
back
to
life.
Finally
he
rose,
made
awkward
by
his
weight.
“Ah,
damn
it,
Ned,
did
you
have
to
bury
her
in
a
place
like
this?”
His
voice
was
hoarse
with
remembered
grief.
“She
deserved
more
than
darkness…”

“She
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,”
Ned
said
quietly.
“This
is
her
place.”

“She
should
be
on
a
hill
somewhere,
under
a
fruit
tree,
with
the
sun
and
clouds
above
her
and
the
rain
to
wash
her
clean.”

“I
was
with
her
when
she
died,”
Ned
reminded
the
king.
“She
wanted
to
come
home,
to
rest
beside
Brandon
and
Father.”
He
could
hear
her
still
at
times.
Promise
me,
she
had
cried,
in
a
room
that
smelled
of
blood
and
roses.
Promise
me,
Ned.
The
fever
had
taken
her
strength
and
her
voice
had
been
faint
as
a
whisper,
but
when
he
gave
her
his
word,
the
fear
had
gone
out
of
his
sister’s
eyes.
Ned
remembered
the
way
she
had
smiled
then,
how
tightly
her
fingers
had
clutched
his
as
she
gave
up
her
hold
on
life,
the
rose
petals
spilling
from
her
palm,
dead
and
black.
After
that
he
remembered
nothing.
They
had
found
him
still
holding
her
body,
silent
with
grief.
The
little
crannogman,
Howland
Reed,
had
taken
her
hand
from
his.
Ned
could
recall
none
of
it.
“I
bring
her
flowers
when
I
can,”
he
said.
“Lyanna
was…
fond
of
flowers.”

The
king
touched
her
cheek,
his
fingers
brushing
across
the
rough
stone
as
gently
as
if
it
were
living
flesh.
“I
vowed
to
kill
Rhaegar
for
what
he
did
to
her.”

“You
did,”
Ned
reminded
him.

“Only
once,”
Robert
said
bitterly.

They
had
come
together
at
the
ford
of
the
Trident
while
the
battle
crashed
around
them,
Robert
with
his
warhammer
and
his
great
antlered
helm,
the
Targaryen
prince
armored
all
in
black.
On
his
breastplate
was
the
three-headed
dragon
of
his
House,
wrought
all
in
rubies
that
flashed
like
fire
in
the
sunlight.
The
waters
of
the
Trident
ran
red
around
the
hooves
of
their
destriers
as
they
circled
and
clashed,
again
and
again,
until
at
last
a
crushing
blow
from
Robert’s
hammer
stove
in
the
dragon
and
the
chest
beneath
it.
When
Ned
had
finally
come
on
the
scene,
Rhaegar
lay
dead
in
the
stream,
while
men
of
both
armies
scrabbled
in
the
swirling
waters
for
rubies
knocked
free
of
his
armor.

“In
my
dreams,
I
kill
him
every
night,”
Robert
admitted.
“A
thousand
deaths
will
still
be
less
than
he
deserves.”

There
was
nothing
Ned
could
say
to
that.
After
a
quiet,
he
said,
“We
should
return,
Your
Grace.
Your
wife
will
be
waiting.”

“The
Others
take
my
wife,”
Robert
muttered
sourly,
but
he
started
back
the
way
they
had
come,
his
footsteps
falling
heavily.
“And
if
I
hear
‘Your
Grace’
once
more,
I’ll
have
your
head
on
a
spike.
We
are
more
to
each
other
than
that.”

“I
had
not
forgotten,”
Ned
replied
quietly.
When
the
king
did
not
answer,
he
said,
“Tell
me
about
Jon.”

Robert
shook
his
head.
“I
have
never
seen
a
man
sicken
so
quickly.
We
gave
a
tourney
on
my
son’s
name
day.
If
you
had
seen
Jon
then,
you
would
have
sworn
he
would
live
forever.
A
fortnight
later
he
was
dead.
The
sickness
was
like
a
fire
in
his
gut.
It
burned
right
through
him.”
He
paused
beside
a
pillar,
before
the
tomb
of
a
long-dead
Stark.
“I
loved
that
old
man.”

“We
both
did.”
Ned
paused
a
moment.
“Catelyn
fears
for
her
sister.
How
does
Lysa
bear
her
grief?”

Robert’s
mouth
gave
a
bitter
twist.
“Not
well,
in
truth,”
he
admitted.
“I
think
losing
Jon
has
driven
the
woman
mad,
Ned.
She
has
taken
the
boy
back
to
the
Eyrie.
Against
my
wishes.
I
had
hoped
to
foster
him
with
Tywin
Lannister
at
Casterly
Rock.
Jon
had
no
brothers,
no
other
sons.
Was
I
supposed
to
leave
him
to
be
raised
by
women?”

Ned
would
sooner
entrust
a
child
to
a
pit
viper
than
to
Lord
Tywin,
but
he
left
his
doubts
unspoken.
Some
old
wounds
never
truly
heal,
and
bleed
again
at
the
slightest
word.
“The
wife
has
lost
the
husband,”
he
said
carefully.
“Perhaps
the
mother
feared
to
lose
the
son.
The
boy
is
very
young.”

“Six,
and
sickly,
and
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
gods
have
mercy,”
the
king
swore.
“Lord
Tywin
had
never
taken
a
ward
before.
Lysa
ought
to
have
been
honored.
The
Lannisters
are
a
great
and
noble
House.
She
refused
to
even
hear
of
it.
Then
she
left
in
the
dead
of
night,
without
so
much
as
a
by-your-leave.
Cersei
was
furious.”
He
sighed
deeply.
“The
boy
is
my
namesake,
did
you
know
that?
Robert
Arryn.
I
am
sworn
to
protect
him.
How
can
I
do
that
if
his
mother
steals
him
away?”

“I
will
take
him
as
ward,
if
you
wish,”
Ned
said.
“Lysa
should
consent
to
that.
She
and
Catelyn
were
close
as
girls,
and
she
would
be
welcome
here
as
well.”

“A
generous
offer,
my
friend,”
the
king
said,
“but
too
late.
Lord
Tywin
has
already
given
his
consent.
Fostering
the
boy
elsewhere
would
be
a
grievous
affront
to
him.”

“I
have
more
concern
for
my
nephew’s
welfare
than
I
do
for
Lannister
pride,”
Ned
declared.

“That
is
because
you
do
not
sleep
with
a
Lannister.”
Robert
laughed,
the
sound
rattling
among
the
tombs
and
bouncing
from
the
vaulted
ceiling.
His
smile
was
a
flash
of
white
teeth
in
the
thicket
of
the
huge
black
beard.
“Ah,
Ned,”
he
said,
“you
are
still
too
serious.”
He
put
a
massive
arm
around
Ned’s
shoulders.
“I
had
planned
to
wait
a
few
days
to
speak
to
you,
but
I
see
now
there’s
no
need
for
it.
Come,
walk
with
me.”

They
started
back
down
between
the
pillars.
Blind
stone
eyes
seemed
to
follow
them
as
they
passed.
The
king
kept
his
arm
around
Ned’s
shoulder.
“You
must
have
wondered
why
I
finally
came
north
to
Winterfell,
after
so
long.”

Ned
had
his
suspicions,
but
he
did
not
give
them
voice.
“For
the
joy
of
my
company,
surely,”
he
said
lightly.
“And
there
is
the
Wall.
You
need
to
see
it,
Your
Grace,
to
walk
along
its
battlements
and
talk
to
those
who
man
it.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
shadow
of
what
it
once
was.
Benjen
says—”

“No
doubt
I
will
hear
what
your
brother
says
soon
enough,”
Robert
said.
“The
Wall
has
stood
for
what,
eight
thousand
years?
It
can
keep
a
few
days
more.
I
have
more
pressing
concerns.
These
are
difficult
times.
I
need
good
men
about
me.
Men
like
Jon
Arryn.
He
served
as
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
as
Warden
of
the
East,
as
the
Hand
of
the
King.
He
will
not
be
easy
to
replace.”

“His
son…”
Ned
began.

“His
son
will
succeed
to
the
Eyrie
and
all
its
incomes,”
Robert
said
brusquely.
“No
more.”

That
took
Ned
by
surprise.
He
stopped,
startled,
and
turned
to
look
at
his
king.
The
words
came
unbidden.
“The
Arryns
have
always
been
Wardens
of
the
East.
The
title
goes
with
the
domain.”

“Perhaps
when
he
comes
of
age,
the
honor
can
be
restored
to
him,”
Robert
said.
“I
have
this
year
to
think
of,
and
next.
A
six-year-old
boy
is
no
war
leader,
Ned.”

“In
peace,
the
title
is
only
an
honor.
Let
the
boy
keep
it.
For
his
father’s
sake
if
not
his
own.
Surely
you
owe
Jon
that
much
for
his
service.”

The
king
was
not
pleased.
He
took
his
arm
from
around
Ned’s
shoulders.
“Jon’s
service
was
the
duty
he
owed
his
liege
lord.
I
am
not
ungrateful,
Ned.
You
of
all
men
ought
to
know
that.
But
the
son
is
not
the
father.
A
mere
boy
cannot
hold
the
east.”
Then
his
tone
softened.
“Enough
of
this.
There
is
a
more
important
office
to
discuss,
and
I
would
not
argue
with
you.”
Robert
grasped
Ned
by
the
elbow.
“I
have
need
of
you,
Ned.”

“I
am
yours
to
command,
Your
Grace.
Always.”
They
were
words
he
had
to
say,
and
so
he
said
them,
apprehensive
about
what
might
come
next.

Robert
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
him.
“Those
years
we
spent
in
the
Eyrie…
gods,
those
were
good
years.
I
want
you
at
my
side
again,
Ned.
I
want
you
down
in
King’s
Landing,
not
up
here
at
the
end
of
the
world
where
you
are
no
damned
use
to
anybody.”
Robert
looked
off
into
the
darkness,
for
a
moment
as
melancholy
as
a
Stark.
“I
swear
to
you,
sitting
a
throne
is
a
thousand
times
harder
than
winning
one.
Laws
are
a
tedious
business
and
counting
coppers
is
worse.
And
the
people…
there
is
no
end
of
them.
I
sit
on
that
damnable
iron
chair
and
listen
to
them
complain
until
my
mind
is
numb
and
my
ass
is
raw.
They
all
want
something,
money
or
land
or
justice.
The
lies
they
tell…
and
my
lords
and
ladies
are
no
better.
I
am
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
fools.
It
can
drive
a
man
to
madness,
Ned.
Half
of
them
don’t
dare
tell
me
the
truth,
and
the
other
half
can’t
find
it.
There
are
nights
I
wish
we
had
lost
at
the
Trident.
Ah,
no,
not
truly,
but…

“I
understand,”
Ned
said
softly.

Robert
looked
at
him.
“I
think
you
do.
If
so,
you
are
the
only
one,
my
old
friend.”
He
smiled.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark,
I
would
name
you
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

Ned
dropped
to
one
knee.
The
offer
did
not
surprise
him;
what
other
reason
could
Robert
have
had
for
coming
so
far?
The
Hand
of
the
King
was
the
second-most
powerful
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
He
spoke
with
the
king’s
voice,
commanded
the
king’s
armies,
drafted
the
king’s
laws.
At
times
he
even
sat
upon
the
Iron
Throne
to
dispense
king’s
justice,
when
the
king
was
absent,
or
sick,
or
otherwise
indisposed.
Robert
was
offering
him
a
responsibility
as
large
as
the
realm
itself.

It
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
wanted.

“Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“I
am
not
worthy
of
the
honor.”

Robert
groaned
with
good-humored
impatience.
“If
I
wanted
to
honor
you,
I’d
let
you
retire.
I
am
planning
to
make
you
run
the
kingdom
and
fight
the
wars
while
I
eat
and
drink
and
wench
myself
into
an
early
grave.”
He
slapped
his
gut
and
grinned.
“You
know
the
saying,
about
the
king
and
his
Hand?”

Ned
knew
the
saying.
“What
the
king
dreams,”
he
said,
“the
Hand
builds.”

“I
bedded
a
fishmaid
once
who
told
me
the
lowborn
have
a
choicer
way
to
put
it.
The
king
eats,
they
say,
and
the
Hand
takes
the
shit.”
He
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
his
laughter.
The
echoes
rang
through
the
darkness,
and
all
around
them
the
dead
of
Winterfell
seemed
to
watch
with
cold
and
disapproving
eyes.

Finally
the
laughter
dwindled
and
stopped.
Ned
was
still
on
one
knee,
his
eyes
upraised.
“Damn
it,
Ned,”
the
king
complained.
“You
might
at
least
humor
me
with
a
smile.”

“They
say
it
grows
so
cold
up
here
in
winter
that
a
man’s
laughter
freezes
in
his
throat
and
chokes
him
to
death,”
Ned
said
evenly.
“Perhaps
that
is
why
the
Starks
have
so
little
humor.”

“Come
south
with
me,
and
I’ll
teach
you
how
to
laugh
again,”
the
king
promised.
“You
helped
me
win
this
damnable
throne,
now
help
me
hold
it.
We
were
meant
to
rule
together.
If
Lyanna
had
lived,
we
should
have
been
brothers,
bound
by
blood
as
well
as
affection.
Well,
it
is
not
too
late.
I
have
a
son.
You
have
a
daughter.
My
Joff
and
your
Sansa
shall
join
our
houses,
as
Lyanna
and
I
might
once
have
done.”

This
offer
did
surprise
him.
“Sansa
is
only
eleven.”

Robert
waved
an
impatient
hand.
“Old
enough
for
betrothal.
The
marriage
can
wait
a
few
years.”
The
king
smiled.
“Now
stand
up
and
say
yes,
curse
you.”

“Nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
answered.
He
hesitated.
“These
honors
are
all
so
unexpected.
May
I
have
some
time
to
consider?
I
need
to
tell
my
wife…”

“Yes,
yes,
of
course,
tell
Catelyn,
sleep
on
it
if
you
must.”
The
king
reached
down,
clasped
Ned
by
the
hand,
and
pulled
him
roughly
to
his
feet.
“Just
don’t
keep
me
waiting
too
long.
I
am
not
the
most
patient
of
men.”

For
a
moment
Eddard
Stark
was
filled
with
a
terrible
sense
of
foreboding.
This
was
his
place,
here
in
the
north.
He
looked
at
the
stone
figures
all
around
them,
breathed
deep
in
the
chill
silence
of
the
crypt.
He
could
feel
the
eyes
of
the
dead.
They
were
all
listening,
he
knew.
And
winter
was
coming.





JON

There
were
times—not
many,
but
a
few—when
Jon
Snow
was
glad
he
was
a
bastard.
As
he
filled
his
wine
cup
once
more
from
a
passing
flagon,
it
struck
him
that
this
might
be
one
of
them.

He
settled
back
in
his
place
on
the
bench
among
the
younger
squires
and
drank.
The
sweet,
fruity
taste
of
summerwine
filled
his
mouth
and
brought
a
smile
to
his
lips.

The
Great
Hall
of
Winterfell
was
hazy
with
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
roasted
meat
and
fresh-baked
bread.
Its
grey
stone
walls
were
draped
with
banners.
White,
gold,
crimson:
the
direwolf
of
Stark,
Baratheon’s
crowned
stag,
the
lion
of
Lannister.
A
singer
was
playing
the
high
harp
and
reciting
a
ballad,
but
down
at
this
end
of
the
hall
his
voice
could
scarcely
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
fire,
the
clangor
of
pewter
plates
and
cups,
and
the
low
mutter
of
a
hundred
drunken
conversations.

It
was
the
fourth
hour
of
the
welcoming
feast
laid
for
the
king.
Jon’s
brothers
and
sisters
had
been
seated
with
the
royal
children,
beneath
the
raised
platform
where
Lord
and
Lady
Stark
hosted
the
king
and
queen.
In
honor
of
the
occasion,
his
lord
father
would
doubtless
permit
each
child
a
glass
of
wine,
but
no
more
than
that.
Down
here
on
the
benches,
there
was
no
one
to
stop
Jon
drinking
as
much
as
he
had
a
thirst
for.

And
he
was
finding
that
he
had
a
man’s
thirst,
to
the
raucous
delight
of
the
youths
around
him,
who
urged
him
on
every
time
he
drained
a
glass.
They
were
fine
company,
and
Jon
relished
the
stories
they
were
telling,
tales
of
battle
and
bedding
and
the
hunt.
He
was
certain
that
his
companions
were
more
entertaining
than
the
king’s
offspring.
He
had
sated
his
curiosity
about
the
visitors
when
they
made
their
entrance.
The
procession
had
passed
not
a
foot
from
the
place
he
had
been
given
on
the
bench,
and
Jon
had
gotten
a
good
long
look
at
them
all.

His
lord
father
had
come
first,
escorting
the
queen.
She
was
as
beautiful
as
men
said.
A
jeweled
tiara
gleamed
amidst
her
long
golden
hair,
its
emeralds
a
perfect
match
for
the
green
of
her
eyes.
His
father
helped
her
up
the
steps
to
the
dais
and
led
her
to
her
seat,
but
the
queen
never
so
much
as
looked
at
him.
Even
at
fourteen,
Jon
could
see
through
her
smile.

Next
had
come
King
Robert
himself,
with
Lady
Stark
on
his
arm.
The
king
was
a
great
disappointment
to
Jon.
His
father
had
talked
of
him
often:
the
peerless
Robert
Baratheon,
demon
of
the
Trident,
the
fiercest
warrior
of
the
realm,
a
giant
among
princes.
Jon
saw
only
a
fat
man,
red-faced
under
his
beard,
sweating
through
his
silks.
He
walked
like
a
man
half
in
his
cups.

After
them
came
the
children.
Little
Rickon
first,
managing
the
long
walk
with
all
the
dignity
a
three-year-old
could
muster.
Jon
had
to
urge
him
on
when
he
stopped
to
visit.
Close
behind
came
Robb,
in
grey
wool
trimmed
with
white,
the
Stark
colors.
He
had
the
Princess
Myrcella
on
his
arm.
She
was
a
wisp
of
a
girl,
not
quite
eight,
her
hair
a
cascade
of
golden
curls
under
a
jeweled
net.
Jon
noticed
the
shy
looks
she
gave
Robb
as
they
passed
between
the
tables
and
the
timid
way
she
smiled
at
him.
He
decided
she
was
insipid.
Robb
didn’t
even
have
the
sense
to
realize
how
stupid
she
was;
he
was
grinning
like
a
fool.

His
half
sisters
escorted
the
royal
princes.
Arya
was
paired
with
plump
young
Tommen,
whose
white-blond
hair
was
longer
than
hers.
Sansa,
two
years
older,
drew
the
crown
prince,
Joffrey
Baratheon.
He
was
twelve,
younger
than
Jon
or
Robb,
but
taller
than
either,
to
Jon’s
vast
dismay.
Prince
Joffrey
had
his
sister’s
hair
and
his
mother’s
deep
green
eyes.
A
thick
tangle
of
blond
curls
dripped
down
past
his
golden
choker
and
high
velvet
collar.
Sansa
looked
radiant
as
she
walked
beside
him,
but
Jon
did
not
like
Joffrey’s
pouty
lips
or
the
bored,
disdainful
way
he
looked
at
Winterfell’s
Great
Hall.

He
was
more
interested
in
the
pair
that
came
behind
him:
the
queen’s
brothers,
the
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock.
The
Lion
and
the
Imp;
there
was
no
mistaking
which
was
which.
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
was
twin
to
Queen
Cersei;
tall
and
golden,
with
flashing
green
eyes
and
a
smile
that
cut
like
a
knife.
He
wore
crimson
silk,
high
black
boots,
a
black
satin
cloak.
On
the
breast
of
his
tunic,
the
lion
of
his
House
was
embroidered
in
gold
thread,
roaring
its
defiance.
They
called
him
the
Lion
of
Lannister
to
his
face
and
whispered
“Kingslayer”
behind
his
back.

Jon
found
it
hard
to
look
away
from
him.
This
is
what
a
king
should
look
like,
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
man
passed.

Then
he
saw
the
other
one,
waddling
along
half-hidden
by
his
brother’s
side.
Tyrion
Lannister,
the
youngest
of
Lord
Tywin’s
brood
and
by
far
the
ugliest.
All
that
the
gods
had
given
to
Cersei
and
Jaime,
they
had
denied
Tyrion.
He
was
a
dwarf,
half
his
brother’s
height,
struggling
to
keep
pace
on
stunted
legs.
His
head
was
too
large
for
his
body,
with
a
brute’s
squashed-in
face
beneath
a
swollen
shelf
of
brow.
One
green
eye
and
one
black
one
peered
out
from
under
a
lank
fall
of
hair
so
blond
it
seemed
white.
Jon
watched
him
with
fascination.

The
last
of
the
high
lords
to
enter
were
his
uncle,
Benjen
Stark
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
his
father’s
ward,
young
Theon
Greyjoy.
Benjen
gave
Jon
a
warm
smile
as
he
went
by.
Theon
ignored
him
utterly,
but
there
was
nothing
new
in
that.
After
all
had
been
seated,
toasts
were
made,
thanks
were
given
and
returned,
and
then
the
feasting
began.

Jon
had
started
drinking
then,
and
he
had
not
stopped.

Something
rubbed
against
his
leg
beneath
the
table.
Jon
saw
red
eyes
staring
up
at
him.
“Hungry
again?”
he
asked.
There
was
still
half
a
honeyed
chicken
in
the
center
of
the
table.
Jon
reached
out
to
tear
off
a
leg,
then
had
a
better
idea.
He
knifed
the
bird
whole
and
let
the
carcass
slide
to
the
floor
between
his
legs.
Ghost
ripped
into
it
in
savage
silence.
His
brothers
and
sisters
had
not
been
permitted
to
bring
their
wolves
to
the
banquet,
but
there
were
more
curs
than
Jon
could
count
at
this
end
of
the
hall,
and
no
one
had
said
a
word
about
his
pup.
He
told
himself
he
was
fortunate
in
that
too.

His
eyes
stung.
Jon
rubbed
at
them
savagely,
cursing
the
smoke.
He
swallowed
another
gulp
of
wine
and
watched
his
direwolf
devour
the
chicken.

Dogs
moved
between
the
tables,
trailing
after
the
serving
girls.
One
of
them,
a
black
mongrel
bitch
with
long
yellow
eyes,
caught
a
scent
of
the
chicken.
She
stopped
and
edged
under
the
bench
to
get
a
share.
Jon
watched
the
confrontation.
The
bitch
growled
low
in
her
throat
and
moved
closer.
Ghost
looked
up,
silent,
and
fixed
the
dog
with
those
hot
red
eyes.
The
bitch
snapped
an
angry
challenge.
She
was
three
times
the
size
of
the
direwolf
pup.
Ghost
did
not
move.
He
stood
over
his
prize
and
opened
his
mouth,
baring
his
fangs.
The
bitch
tensed,
barked
again,
then
thought
better
of
this
fight.
She
turned
and
slunk
away,
with
one
last
defiant
snap
to
save
her
pride.
Ghost
went
back
to
his
meal.

Jon
grinned
and
reached
under
the
table
to
ruffle
the
shaggy
white
fur.
The
direwolf
looked
up
at
him,
nipped
gently
at
his
hand,
then
went
back
to
eating.

“Is
this
one
of
the
direwolves
I’ve
heard
so
much
of?”
a
familiar
voice
asked
close
at
hand.

Jon
looked
up
happily
as
his
uncle
Ben
put
a
hand
on
his
head
and
ruffled
his
hair
much
as
Jon
had
ruffled
the
wolf’s.
“Yes,”
he
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.”

One
of
the
squires
interrupted
the
bawdy
story
he’d
been
telling
to
make
room
at
the
table
for
their
lord’s
brother.
Benjen
Stark
straddled
the
bench
with
long
legs
and
took
the
wine
cup
out
of
Jon’s
hand.
“Summerwine,”
he
said
after
a
taste.
“Nothing
so
sweet.
How
many
cups
have
you
had,
Jon?”

Jon
smiled.

Ben
Stark
laughed.
“As
I
feared.
Ah,
well.
I
believe
I
was
younger
than
you
the
first
time
I
got
truly
and
sincerely
drunk.”
He
snagged
a
roasted
onion,
dripping
brown
with
gravy,
from
a
nearby
trencher
and
bit
into
it.
It
crunched.

His
uncle
was
sharp-featured
and
gaunt
as
a
mountain
crag,
but
there
was
always
a
hint
of
laughter
in
his
blue-grey
eyes.
He
dressed
in
black,
as
befitted
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Tonight
it
was
rich
black
velvet,
with
high
leather
boots
and
a
wide
belt
with
a
silver
buckle.
A
heavy
silver
chain
was
looped
round
his
neck.
Benjen
watched
Ghost
with
amusement
as
he
ate
his
onion.
“A
very
quiet
wolf,”
he
observed.

“He’s
not
like
the
others,”
Jon
said.
“He
never
makes
a
sound.
That’s
why
I
named
him
Ghost.
That,
and
because
he’s
white.
The
others
are
all
dark,
grey
or
black.”

“There
are
still
direwolves
beyond
the
Wall.
We
hear
them
on
our
rangings.”
Benjen
Stark
gave
Jon
a
long
look.
“Don’t
you
usually
eat
at
table
with
your
brothers?”

“Most
times,”
Jon
answered
in
a
flat
voice.
“But
tonight
Lady
Stark
thought
it
might
give
insult
to
the
royal
family
to
seat
a
bastard
among
them.”

“I
see.”
His
uncle
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
raised
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
“My
brother
does
not
seem
very
festive
tonight.”

Jon
had
noticed
that
too.
A
bastard
had
to
learn
to
notice
things,
to
read
the
truth
that
people
hid
behind
their
eyes.
His
father
was
observing
all
the
courtesies,
but
there
was
tightness
in
him
that
Jon
had
seldom
seen
before.
He
said
little,
looking
out
over
the
hall
with
hooded
eyes,
seeing
nothing.
Two
seats
away,
the
king
had
been
drinking
heavily
all
night.
His
broad
face
was
flushed
behind
his
great
black
beard.
He
made
many
a
toast,
laughed
loudly
at
every
jest,
and
attacked
each
dish
like
a
starving
man,
but
beside
him
the
queen
seemed
as
cold
as
an
ice
sculpture.
“The
queen
is
angry
too,”
Jon
told
his
uncle
in
a
low,
quiet
voice.
“Father
took
the
king
down
to
the
crypts
this
afternoon.
The
queen
didn’t
want
him
to
go.”

Benjen
gave
Jon
a
careful,
measuring
look.
“You
don’t
miss
much,
do
you,
Jon?
We
could
use
a
man
like
you
on
the
Wall.”

Jon
swelled
with
pride.
“Robb
is
a
stronger
lance
than
I
am,
but
I’m
the
better
sword,
and
Hullen
says
I
sit
a
horse
as
well
as
anyone
in
the
castle.”

“Notable
achievements.”

“Take
me
with
you
when
you
go
back
to
the
Wall,”
Jon
said
in
a
sudden
rush.
“Father
will
give
me
leave
to
go
if
you
ask
him,
I
know
he
will.”

Uncle
Benjen
studied
his
face
carefully.
“The
Wall
is
a
hard
place
for
a
boy,
Jon.”

“I
am
almost
a
man
grown,”
Jon
protested.
“I
will
turn
fifteen
on
my
next
name
day,
and
Maester
Luwin
says
bastards
grow
up
faster
than
other
children.”

“That’s
true
enough,”
Benjen
said
with
a
downward
twist
of
his
mouth.
He
took
Jon’s
cup
from
the
table,
filled
it
fresh
from
a
nearby
pitcher,
and
drank
down
a
long
swallow.

“Daeren
Targaryen
was
only
fourteen
when
he
conquered
Dorne,”
Jon
said.
The
Young
Dragon
was
one
of
his
heroes.

“A
conquest
that
lasted
a
summer,”
his
uncle
pointed
out.
“Your
Boy
King
lost
ten
thousand
men
taking
the
place,
and
another
fifty
trying
to
hold
it.
Someone
should
have
told
him
that
war
isn’t
a
game.”
He
took
another
sip
of
wine.
“Also,”
he
said,
wiping
his
mouth,
“Daeren
Targaryen
was
only
eighteen
when
he
died.
Or
have
you
forgotten
that
part?”

“I
forget
nothing,”
Jon
boasted.
The
wine
was
making
him
bold.
He
tried
to
sit
very
straight,
to
make
himself
seem
taller.
“I
want
to
serve
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
Uncle.”

He
had
thought
on
it
long
and
hard,
lying
abed
at
night
while
his
brothers
slept
around
him.
Robb
would
someday
inherit
Winterfell,
would
command
great
armies
as
the
Warden
of
the
North.
Bran
and
Rickon
would
be
Robb’s
bannermen
and
rule
holdfasts
in
his
name.
His
sisters
Arya
and
Sansa
would
marry
the
heirs
of
other
great
houses
and
go
south
as
mistress
of
castles
of
their
own.
But
what
place
could
a
bastard
hope
to
earn?

“You
don’t
know
what
you’re
asking,
Jon.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
sworn
brotherhood.
We
have
no
families.
None
of
us
will
ever
father
sons.
Our
wife
is
duty.
Our
mistress
is
honor.”

“A
bastard
can
have
honor
too,”
Jon
said.
“I
am
ready
to
swear
your
oath.”

“You
are
a
boy
of
fourteen,”
Benjen
said.
“Not
a
man,
not
yet.
Until
you
have
known
a
woman,
you
cannot
understand
what
you
would
be
giving
up.”

“I
don’t
care
about
that!”
Jon
said
hotly.

“You
might,
if
you
knew
what
it
meant,”
Benjen
said.
“If
you
knew
what
the
oath
would
cost
you,
you
might
be
less
eager
to
pay
the
price,
son.”

Jon
felt
anger
rise
inside
him.
“I’m
not
your
son!”

Benjen
Stark
stood
up.
“More’s
the
pity.”
He
put
a
hand
on
Jon’s
shoulder.
“Come
back
to
me
after
you’ve
fathered
a
few
bastards
of
your
own,
and
we’ll
see
how
you
feel.”

Jon
trembled.
“I
will
never
father
a
bastard,”
he
said
carefully.
“Never!”
He
spat
it
out
like
venom.

Suddenly
he
realized
that
the
table
had
fallen
silent,
and
they
were
all
looking
at
him.
He
felt
the
tears
begin
to
well
behind
his
eyes.
He
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.

“I
must
be
excused,”
he
said
with
the
last
of
his
dignity.
He
whirled
and
bolted
before
they
could
see
him
cry.
He
must
have
drunk
more
wine
than
he
had
realized.
His
feet
got
tangled
under
him
as
he
tried
to
leave,
and
he
lurched
sideways
into
a
serving
girl
and
sent
a
flagon
of
spiced
wine
crashing
to
the
floor.
Laughter
boomed
all
around
him,
and
Jon
felt
hot
tears
on
his
cheeks.
Someone
tried
to
steady
him.
He
wrenched
free
of
their
grip
and
ran,
half-blind,
for
the
door.
Ghost
followed
close
at
his
heels,
out
into
the
night.

The
yard
was
quiet
and
empty.
A
lone
sentry
stood
high
on
the
battlements
of
the
inner
wall,
his
cloak
pulled
tight
around
him
against
the
cold.
He
looked
bored
and
miserable
as
he
huddled
there
alone,
but
Jon
would
have
traded
places
with
him
in
an
instant.
Otherwise
the
castle
was
dark
and
deserted.
Jon
had
seen
an
abandoned
holdfast
once,
a
drear
place
where
nothing
moved
but
the
wind
and
the
stones
kept
silent
about
whatever
people
had
lived
there.
Winterfell
reminded
him
of
that
tonight.

The
sounds
of
music
and
song
spilled
through
the
open
windows
behind
him.
They
were
the
last
things
Jon
wanted
to
hear.
He
wiped
away
his
tears
on
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt,
furious
that
he
had
let
them
fall,
and
turned
to
go.

“Boy,”
a
voice
called
out
to
him.
Jon
turned.

Tyrion
Lannister
was
sitting
on
the
ledge
above
the
door
to
the
Great
Hall,
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
gargoyle.
The
dwarf
grinned
down
at
him.
“Is
that
animal
a
wolf?”

“A
direwolf,”
Jon
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.”
He
stared
up
at
the
little
man,
his
disappointment
suddenly
forgotten.
“What
are
you
doing
up
there?
Why
aren’t
you
at
the
feast?”

“Too
hot,
too
noisy,
and
I’d
drunk
too
much
wine,”
the
dwarf
told
him.
“I
learned
long
ago
that
it
is
considered
rude
to
vomit
on
your
brother.
Might
I
have
a
closer
look
at
your
wolf?”

Jon
hesitated,
then
nodded
slowly.
“Can
you
climb
down,
or
shall
I
bring
a
ladder?”

“Oh,
bleed
that,”
the
little
man
said.
He
pushed
himself
off
the
ledge
into
empty
air.
Jon
gasped,
then
watched
with
awe
as
Tyrion
Lannister
spun
around
in
a
tight
ball,
landed
lightly
on
his
hands,
then
vaulted
backward
onto
his
legs.

Ghost
backed
away
from
him
uncertainly.

The
dwarf
dusted
himself
off
and
laughed.
“I
believe
I’ve
frightened
your
wolf.
My
apologies.”

“He’s
not
scared,”
Jon
said.
He
knelt
and
called
out.
“Ghost,
come
here.
Come
on.
That’s
it.”

The
wolf
pup
padded
closer
and
nuzzled
at
Jon’s
face,
but
he
kept
a
wary
eye
on
Tyrion
Lannister,
and
when
the
dwarf
reached
out
to
pet
him,
he
drew
back
and
bared
his
fangs
in
a
silent
snarl.
“Shy,
isn’t
he?”
Lannister
observed.

“Sit,
Ghost,”
Jon
commanded.
“That’s
it.
Keep
still.”
He
looked
up
at
the
dwarf.
“You
can
touch
him
now.
He
won’t
move
until
I
tell
him
to.
I’ve
been
training
him.”

“I
see,”
Lannister
said.
He
ruffled
the
snow-white
fur
between
Ghost’s
ears
and
said,
“Nice
wolf.”

“If
I
wasn’t
here,
he’d
tear
out
your
throat,”
Jon
said.
It
wasn’t
actually
true
yet,
but
it
would
be.

“In
that
case,
you
had
best
stay
close,”
the
dwarf
said.
He
cocked
his
oversized
head
to
one
side
and
looked
Jon
over
with
his
mismatched
eyes.
“I
am
Tyrion
Lannister.”

“I
know,”
Jon
said.
He
rose.
Standing,
he
was
taller
than
the
dwarf.
It
made
him
feel
strange.

“You’re
Ned
Stark’s
bastard,
aren’t
you?”

Jon
felt
a
coldness
pass
right
through
him.
He
pressed
his
lips
together
and
said
nothing.

“Did
I
offend
you?”
Lannister
said.
“Sorry.
Dwarfs
don’t
have
to
be
tactful.
Generations
of
capering
fools
in
motley
have
won
me
the
right
to
dress
badly
and
say
any
damn
thing
that
comes
into
my
head.”
He
grinned.
“You
are
the
bastard,
though.”

“Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
my
father,”
Jon
admitted
stiffly.

Lannister
studied
his
face.
“Yes,”
he
said.
“I
can
see
it.
You
have
more
of
the
north
in
you
than
your
brothers.”

“Half
brothers,”
Jon
corrected.
He
was
pleased
by
the
dwarf’s
comment,
but
he
tried
not
to
let
it
show.

“Let
me
give
you
some
counsel,
bastard,”
Lannister
said.
“Never
forget
what
you
are,
for
surely
the
world
will
not.
Make
it
your
strength.
Then
it
can
never
be
your
weakness.
Armor
yourself
in
it,
and
it
will
never
be
used
to
hurt
you.”

Jon
was
in
no
mood
for
anyone’s
counsel.
“What
do
you
know
about
being
a
bastard?”

“All
dwarfs
are
bastards
in
their
father’s
eyes.”

“You
are
your
mother’s
trueborn
son
of
Lannister.”

“Am
I?”
the
dwarf
replied,
sardonic.
“Do
tell
my
lord
father.
My
mother
died
birthing
me,
and
he’s
never
been
sure.”

“I
don’t
even
know
who
my
mother
was,”
Jon
said.

“Some
woman,
no
doubt.
Most
of
them
are.”
He
favored
Jon
with
a
rueful
grin.
“Remember
this,
boy.
All
dwarfs
may
be
bastards,
yet
not
all
bastards
need
be
dwarfs.”
And
with
that
he
turned
and
sauntered
back
into
the
feast,
whistling
a
tune.
When
he
opened
the
door,
the
light
from
within
threw
his
shadow
clear
across
the
yard,
and
for
just
a
moment
Tyrion
Lannister
stood
tall
as
a
king.





CATELYN

Of
all
the
rooms
in
Winterfell’s
Great
Keep,
Catelyn’s
bedchambers
were
the
hottest.
She
seldom
had
to
light
a
fire.
The
castle
had
been
built
over
natural
hot
springs,
and
the
scalding
waters
rushed
through
its
walls
and
chambers
like
blood
through
a
man’s
body,
driving
the
chill
from
the
stone
halls,
filling
the
glass
gardens
with
a
moist
warmth,
keeping
the
earth
from
freezing.
Open
pools
smoked
day
and
night
in
a
dozen
small
courtyards.
That
was
a
little
thing,
in
summer;
in
winter,
it
was
the
difference
between
life
and
death.

Catelyn’s
bath
was
always
hot
and
steaming,
and
her
walls
warm
to
the
touch.
The
warmth
reminded
her
of
Riverrun,
of
days
in
the
sun
with
Lysa
and
Edmure,
but
Ned
could
never
abide
the
heat.
The
Starks
were
made
for
the
cold,
he
would
tell
her,
and
she
would
laugh
and
tell
him
in
that
case
they
had
certainly
built
their
castle
in
the
wrong
place.

So
when
they
had
finished,
Ned
rolled
off
and
climbed
from
her
bed,
as
he
had
a
thousand
times
before.
He
crossed
the
room,
pulled
back
the
heavy
tapestries,
and
threw
open
the
high
narrow
windows
one
by
one,
letting
the
night
air
into
the
chamber.

The
wind
swirled
around
him
as
he
stood
facing
the
dark,
naked
and
empty-handed.
Catelyn
pulled
the
furs
to
her
chin
and
watched
him.
He
looked
somehow
smaller
and
more
vulnerable,
like
the
youth
she
had
wed
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun,
fifteen
long
years
gone.
Her
loins
still
ached
from
the
urgency
of
his
lovemaking.
It
was
a
good
ache.
She
could
feel
his
seed
within
her.
She
prayed
that
it
might
quicken
there.
It
had
been
three
years
since
Rickon.
She
was
not
too
old.
She
could
give
him
another
son.

“I
will
refuse
him,”
Ned
said
as
he
turned
back
to
her.
His
eyes
were
haunted,
his
voice
thick
with
doubt.

Catelyn
sat
up
in
the
bed.
“You
cannot.
You
must
not.”

“My
duties
are
here
in
the
north.
I
have
no
wish
to
be
Robert’s
Hand.”

“He
will
not
understand
that.
He
is
a
king
now,
and
kings
are
not
like
other
men.
If
you
refuse
to
serve
him,
he
will
wonder
why,
and
sooner
or
later
he
will
begin
to
suspect
that
you
oppose
him.
Can’t
you
see
the
danger
that
would
put
us
in?”

Ned
shook
his
head,
refusing
to
believe.
“Robert
would
never
harm
me
or
any
of
mine.
We
were
closer
than
brothers.
He
loves
me.
If
I
refuse
him,
he
will
roar
and
curse
and
bluster,
and
in
a
week
we
will
laugh
about
it
together.
I
know
the
man!”

“You
knew
the
man,”
she
said.
“The
king
is
a
stranger
to
you.”
Catelyn
remembered
the
direwolf
dead
in
the
snow,
the
broken
antler
lodged
deep
in
her
throat.
She
had
to
make
him
see.
“Pride
is
everything
to
a
king,
my
lord.
Robert
came
all
this
way
to
see
you,
to
bring
you
these
great
honors,
you
cannot
throw
them
back
in
his
face.”

“Honors?”
Ned
laughed
bitterly.

“In
his
eyes,
yes,”
she
said.

“And
in
yours?”

“And
in
mine,”
she
blazed,
angry
now.
Why
couldn’t
he
see?
“He
offers
his
own
son
in
marriage
to
our
daughter,
what
else
would
you
call
that?
Sansa
might
someday
be
queen.
Her
sons
could
rule
from
the
Wall
to
the
mountains
of
Dorne.
What
is
so
wrong
with
that?”

“Gods,
Catelyn,
Sansa
is
only
eleven,”
Ned
said.
“And
Joffrey…
Joffrey
is…”

She
finished
for
him.
“…crown
prince,
and
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne.
And
I
was
only
twelve
when
my
father
promised
me
to
your
brother
Brandon.”

That
brought
a
bitter
twist
to
Ned’s
mouth.
“Brandon.
Yes.
Brandon
would
know
what
to
do.
He
always
did.
It
was
all
meant
for
Brandon.
You,
Winterfell,
everything.
He
was
born
to
be
a
King’s
Hand
and
a
father
to
queens.
I
never
asked
for
this
cup
to
pass
to
me.”

“Perhaps
not,”
Catelyn
said,
“but
Brandon
is
dead,
and
the
cup
has
passed,
and
you
must
drink
from
it,
like
it
or
not.”

Ned
turned
away
from
her,
back
to
the
night.
He
stood
staring
out
in
the
darkness,
watching
the
moon
and
the
stars
perhaps,
or
perhaps
the
sentries
on
the
wall.

Catelyn
softened
then,
to
see
his
pain.
Eddard
Stark
had
married
her
in
Brandon’s
place,
as
custom
decreed,
but
the
shadow
of
his
dead
brother
still
lay
between
them,
as
did
the
other,
the
shadow
of
the
woman
he
would
not
name,
the
woman
who
had
borne
him
his
bastard
son.

She
was
about
to
go
to
him
when
the
knock
came
at
the
door,
loud
and
unexpected.
Ned
turned,
frowning.
“What
is
it?”

Desmond’s
voice
came
through
the
door.
“My
lord,
Maester
Luwin
is
without
and
begs
urgent
audience.”

“You
told
him
I
had
left
orders
not
to
be
disturbed?”

“Yes,
my
lord.
He
insists.”

“Very
well.
Send
him
in.”

Ned
crossed
to
the
wardrobe
and
slipped
on
a
heavy
robe.
Catelyn
realized
suddenly
how
cold
it
had
become.
She
sat
up
in
bed
and
pulled
the
furs
to
her
chin.
“Perhaps
we
should
close
the
windows,”
she
suggested.

Ned
nodded
absently.
Maester
Luwin
was
shown
in.

The
maester
was
a
small
grey
man.
His
eyes
were
grey,
and
quick,
and
saw
much.
His
hair
was
grey,
what
little
the
years
had
left
him.
His
robe
was
grey
wool,
trimmed
with
white
fur,
the
Stark
colors.
Its
great
floppy
sleeves
had
pockets
hidden
inside.
Luwin
was
always
tucking
things
into
those
sleeves
and
producing
other
things
from
them:
books,
messages,
strange
artifacts,
toys
for
the
children.
With
all
he
kept
hidden
in
his
sleeves,
Catelyn
was
surprised
that
Maester
Luwin
could
lift
his
arms
at
all.

The
maester
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
before
he
spoke.
“My
lord,”
he
said
to
Ned,
“pardon
for
disturbing
your
rest.
I
have
been
left
a
message.”

Ned
looked
irritated.
“Been
left?
By
whom?
Has
there
been
a
rider?
I
was
not
told.”

“There
was
no
rider,
my
lord.
Only
a
carved
wooden
box,
left
on
a
table
in
my
observatory
while
I
napped.
My
servants
saw
no
one,
but
it
must
have
been
brought
by
someone
in
the
king’s
party.
We
have
had
no
other
visitors
from
the
south.”

“A
wooden
box,
you
say?”
Catelyn
said.

“Inside
was
a
fine
new
lens
for
the
observatory,
from
Myr
by
the
look
of
it.
The
lenscrafters
of
Myr
are
without
equal.”

Ned
frowned.
He
had
little
patience
for
this
sort
of
thing,
Catelyn
knew.
“A
lens,”
he
said.
“What
has
that
to
do
with
me?”

“I
asked
the
same
question,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Clearly
there
was
more
to
this
than
the
seeming.”

Under
the
heavy
weight
of
her
furs,
Catelyn
shivered.
“A
lens
is
an
instrument
to
help
us
see.”

“Indeed
it
is.”
He
fingered
the
collar
of
his
order;
a
heavy
chain
worn
tight
around
the
neck
beneath
his
robe,
each
link
forged
from
a
different
metal.

Catelyn
could
feel
dread
stirring
inside
her
once
again.
“What
is
it
that
they
would
have
us
see
more
clearly?”

“The
very
thing
I
asked
myself.”
Maester
Luwin
drew
a
tightly
rolled
paper
out
of
his
sleeve.
“I
found
the
true
message
concealed
within
a
false
bottom
when
I
dismantled
the
box
the
lens
had
come
in,
but
it
is
not
for
my
eyes.”

Ned
held
out
his
hand.
“Let
me
have
it,
then.”

Luwin
did
not
stir.
“Pardons,
my
lord.
The
message
is
not
for
you
either.
It
is
marked
for
the
eyes
of
the
Lady
Catelyn,
and
her
alone.
May
I
approach?”

Catelyn
nodded,
not
trusting
to
speak.
The
maester
placed
the
paper
on
the
table
beside
the
bed.
It
was
sealed
with
a
small
blob
of
blue
wax.
Luwin
bowed
and
began
to
retreat.

“Stay,”
Ned
commanded
him.
His
voice
was
grave.
He
looked
at
Catelyn.
“What
is
it?
My
lady,
you’re
shaking.”

“I’m
afraid,”
she
admitted.
She
reached
out
and
took
the
letter
in
trembling
hands.
The
furs
dropped
away
from
her
nakedness,
forgotten.
In
the
blue
wax
was
the
moon-and-falcon
seal
of
House
Arryn.
“It’s
from
Lysa.”
Catelyn
looked
at
her
husband.
“It
will
not
make
us
glad,”
she
told
him.
“There
is
grief
in
this
message,
Ned.
I
can
feel
it.”

Ned
frowned,
his
face
darkening.
“Open
it.”

Catelyn
broke
the
seal.

Her
eyes
moved
over
the
words.
At
first
they
made
no
sense
to
her.
Then
she
remembered.
“Lysa
took
no
chances.
When
we
were
girls
together,
we
had
a
private
language,
she
and
I.”

“Can
you
read
it?”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
admitted.

“Then
tell
us.”

“Perhaps
I
should
withdraw,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

“No,”
Catelyn
said.
“We
will
need
your
counsel.”
She
threw
back
the
furs
and
climbed
from
the
bed.
The
night
air
was
as
cold
as
the
grave
on
her
bare
skin
as
she
padded
across
the
room.

Maester
Luwin
averted
his
eyes.
Even
Ned
looked
shocked.
“What
are
you
doing?”
he
asked.

“Lighting
a
fire,”
Catelyn
told
him.
She
found
a
dressing
gown
and
shrugged
into
it,
then
knelt
over
the
cold
hearth.

“Maester
Luwin—”
Ned
began.

“Maester
Luwin
has
delivered
all
my
children,”
Catelyn
said.
“This
is
no
time
for
false
modesty.”
She
slid
the
paper
in
among
the
kindling
and
placed
the
heavier
logs
on
top
of
it.

Ned
crossed
the
room,
took
her
by
the
arm,
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet.
He
held
her
there,
his
face
inches
from
her.
“My
lady,
tell
me!
What
was
this
message?”

Catelyn
stiffened
in
his
grasp.
“A
warning,”
she
said
softly.
“If
we
have
the
wits
to
hear.”

His
eyes
searched
her
face.
“Go
on.”

“Lysa
says
Jon
Arryn
was
murdered.”

His
fingers
tightened
on
her
arm.
“By
whom?”

“The
Lannisters,”
she
told
him.
“The
queen.”

Ned
released
his
hold
on
her
arm.
There
were
deep
red
marks
on
her
skin.
“Gods,”
he
whispered.
His
voice
was
hoarse.
“Your
sister
is
sick
with
grief.
She
cannot
know
what
she
is
saying.”

“She
knows,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lysa
is
impulsive,
yes,
but
this
message
was
carefully
planned,
cleverly
hidden.
She
knew
it
meant
death
if
her
letter
fell
into
the
wrong
hands.
To
risk
so
much,
she
must
have
had
more
than
mere
suspicion.”
Catelyn
looked
to
her
husband.
“Now
we
truly
have
no
choice.
You
must
be
Robert’s
Hand.
You
must
go
south
with
him
and
learn
the
truth.”

She
saw
at
once
that
Ned
had
reached
a
very
different
conclusion.
“The
only
truths
I
know
are
here.
The
south
is
a
nest
of
adders
I
would
do
better
to
avoid.”

Luwin
plucked
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
had
chafed
the
soft
skin
of
his
throat.
“The
Hand
of
the
King
has
great
power,
my
lord.
Power
to
find
the
truth
of
Lord
Arryn’s
death,
to
bring
his
killers
to
the
king’s
justice.
Power
to
protect
Lady
Arryn
and
her
son,
if
the
worst
be
true.”

Ned
glanced
helplessly
around
the
bedchamber.
Catelyn’s
heart
went
out
to
him,
but
she
knew
she
could
not
take
him
in
her
arms
just
then.
First
the
victory
must
be
won,
for
her
children’s
sake.
“You
say
you
love
Robert
like
a
brother.
Would
you
leave
your
brother
surrounded
by
Lannisters?”

“The
Others
take
both
of
you,”
Ned
muttered
darkly.
He
turned
away
from
them
and
went
to
the
window.
She
did
not
speak,
nor
did
the
maester.
They
waited,
quiet,
while
Eddard
Stark
said
a
silent
farewell
to
the
home
he
loved.
When
he
turned
away
from
the
window
at
last,
his
voice
was
tired
and
full
of
melancholy,
and
moisture
glittered
faintly
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes.
“My
father
went
south
once,
to
answer
the
summons
of
a
king.
He
never
came
home
again.”

“A
different
time,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“A
different
king.”

“Yes,”
Ned
said
dully.
He
seated
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
hearth.
“Catelyn,
you
shall
stay
here
in
Winterfell.”

His
words
were
like
an
icy
draft
through
her
heart.
“No,”
she
said,
suddenly
afraid.
Was
this
to
be
her
punishment?
Never
to
see
his
face
again,
nor
to
feel
his
arms
around
her?

“Yes,”
Ned
said,
in
words
that
would
brook
no
argument.
“You
must
govern
the
north
in
my
stead,
while
I
run
Robert’s
errands.
There
must
always
be
a
Stark
in
Winterfell.
Robb
is
fourteen.
Soon
enough,
he
will
be
a
man
grown.
He
must
learn
to
rule,
and
I
will
not
be
here
for
him.
Make
him
part
of
your
councils.
He
must
be
ready
when
his
time
comes.”

“Gods
will,
not
for
many
years,”
Maester
Luwin
murmured.

“Maester
Luwin,
I
trust
you
as
I
would
my
own
blood.
Give
my
wife
your
voice
in
all
things
great
and
small.
Teach
my
son
the
things
he
needs
to
know.
Winter
is
coming.”

Maester
Luwin
nodded
gravely.
Then
silence
fell,
until
Catelyn
found
her
courage
and
asked
the
question
whose
answer
she
most
dreaded.
“What
of
the
other
children?”

Ned
stood,
and
took
her
in
his
arms,
and
held
her
face
close
to
his.
“Rickon
is
very
young,”
he
said
gently.
“He
should
stay
here
with
you
and
Robb.
The
others
I
would
take
with
me.”

“I
could
not
bear
it,”
Catelyn
said,
trembling.

“You
must,”
he
said.
“Sansa
must
wed
Joffrey,
that
is
clear
now,
we
must
give
them
no
grounds
to
suspect
our
devotion.
And
it
is
past
time
that
Arya
learned
the
ways
of
a
southron
court.
In
a
few
years
she
will
be
of
an
age
to
marry
too.”

Sansa
would
shine
in
the
south,
Catelyn
thought
to
herself,
and
the
gods
knew
that
Arya
needed
refinement.
Reluctantly,
she
let
go
of
them
in
her
heart.
But
not
Bran.
Never
Bran.
“Yes,”
she
said,
“but
please,
Ned,
for
the
love
you
bear
me,
let
Bran
remain
here
at
Winterfell.
He
is
only
seven.”

“I
was
eight
when
my
father
sent
me
to
foster
at
the
Eyrie,”
Ned
said.
“Ser
Rodrik
tells
me
there
is
bad
feeling
between
Robb
and
Prince
Joffrey.
That
is
not
healthy.
Bran
can
bridge
that
distance.
He
is
a
sweet
boy,
quick
to
laugh,
easy
to
love.
Let
him
grow
up
with
the
young
princes,
let
him
become
their
friend
as
Robert
became
mine.
Our
House
will
be
the
safer
for
it.”

He
was
right;
Catelyn
knew
it.
It
did
not
make
the
pain
any
easier
to
bear.
She
would
lose
all
four
of
them,
then:
Ned,
and
both
girls,
and
her
sweet,
loving
Bran.
Only
Robb
and
little
Rickon
would
be
left
to
her.
She
felt
lonely
already.
Winterfell
was
such
a
vast
place.
“Keep
him
off
the
walls,
then,”
she
said
bravely.
“You
know
how
Bran
loves
to
climb.”

Ned
kissed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
before
they
could
fall.
“Thank
you,
my
lady,”
he
whispered.
“This
is
hard,
I
know.”

“What
of
Jon
Snow,
my
lord?”
Maester
Luwin
asked.

Catelyn
tensed
at
the
mention
of
the
name.
Ned
felt
the
anger
in
her,
and
pulled
away.

Many
men
fathered
bastards.
Catelyn
had
grown
up
with
that
knowledge.
It
came
as
no
surprise
to
her,
in
the
first
year
of
her
marriage,
to
learn
that
Ned
had
fathered
a
child
on
some
girl
chance
met
on
campaign.
He
had
a
man’s
needs,
after
all,
and
they
had
spent
that
year
apart,
Ned
off
at
war
in
the
south
while
she
remained
safe
in
her
father’s
castle
at
Riverrun.
Her
thoughts
were
more
of
Robb,
the
infant
at
her
breast,
than
of
the
husband
she
scarcely
knew.
He
was
welcome
to
whatever
solace
he
might
find
between
battles.
And
if
his
seed
quickened,
she
expected
he
would
see
to
the
child’s
needs.

He
did
more
than
that.
The
Starks
were
not
like
other
men.
Ned
brought
his
bastard
home
with
him,
and
called
him
“son”
for
all
the
north
to
see.
When
the
wars
were
over
at
last,
and
Catelyn
rode
to
Winterfell,
Jon
and
his
wet
nurse
had
already
taken
up
residence.

That
cut
deep.
Ned
would
not
speak
of
the
mother,
not
so
much
as
a
word,
but
a
castle
has
no
secrets,
and
Catelyn
heard
her
maids
repeating
tales
they
heard
from
the
lips
of
her
husband’s
soldiers.
They
whispered
of
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
deadliest
of
the
seven
knights
of
Aerys’s
Kingsguard,
and
of
how
their
young
lord
had
slain
him
in
single
combat.
And
they
told
how
afterward
Ned
had
carried
Ser
Arthur’s
sword
back
to
the
beautiful
young
sister
who
awaited
him
in
a
castle
called
Starfall
on
the
shores
of
the
Summer
Sea.
The
Lady
Ashara
Dayne,
tall
and
fair,
with
haunting
violet
eyes.
It
had
taken
her
a
fortnight
to
marshal
her
courage,
but
finally,
in
bed
one
night,
Catelyn
had
asked
her
husband
the
truth
of
it,
asked
him
to
his
face.

That
was
the
only
time
in
all
their
years
that
Ned
had
ever
frightened
her.
“Never
ask
me
about
Jon,”
he
said,
cold
as
ice.
“He
is
my
blood,
and
that
is
all
you
need
to
know.
And
now
I
will
learn
where
you
heard
that
name,
my
lady.”
She
had
pledged
to
obey;
she
told
him;
and
from
that
day
on,
the
whispering
had
stopped,
and
Ashara
Dayne’s
name
was
never
heard
in
Winterfell
again.

Whoever
Jon’s
mother
had
been,
Ned
must
have
loved
her
fiercely,
for
nothing
Catelyn
said
would
persuade
him
to
send
the
boy
away.
It
was
the
one
thing
she
could
never
forgive
him.
She
had
come
to
love
her
husband
with
all
her
heart,
but
she
had
never
found
it
in
her
to
love
Jon.
She
might
have
overlooked
a
dozen
bastards
for
Ned’s
sake,
so
long
as
they
were
out
of
sight.
Jon
was
never
out
of
sight,
and
as
he
grew,
he
looked
more
like
Ned
than
any
of
the
trueborn
sons
she
bore
him.
Somehow
that
made
it
worse.
“Jon
must
go,”
she
said
now.

“He
and
Robb
are
close,”
Ned
said.
“I
had
hoped…”

“He
cannot
stay
here,”
Catelyn
said,
cutting
him
off.
“He
is
your
son,
not
mine.
I
will
not
have
him.”
It
was
hard,
she
knew,
but
no
less
the
truth.
Ned
would
do
the
boy
no
kindness
by
leaving
him
here
at
Winterfell.

The
look
Ned
gave
her
was
anguished.
“You
know
I
cannot
take
him
south.
There
will
be
no
place
for
him
at
court.
A
boy
with
a
bastard’s
name…
you
know
what
they
will
say
of
him.
He
will
be
shunned.”

Catelyn
armored
her
heart
against
the
mute
appeal
in
her
husband’s
eyes.
“They
say
your
friend
Robert
has
fathered
a
dozen
bastards
himself.”

“And
none
of
them
has
ever
been
seen
at
court!”
Ned
blazed.
“The
Lannister
woman
has
seen
to
that.
How
can
you
be
so
damnably
cruel,
Catelyn?
He
is
only
a
boy.
He—”

His
fury
was
on
him.
He
might
have
said
more,
and
worse,
but
Maester
Luwin
cut
in.
“Another
solution
presents
itself,”
he
said,
his
voice
quiet.
“Your
brother
Benjen
came
to
me
about
Jon
a
few
days
ago.
It
seems
the
boy
aspires
to
take
the
black.”

Ned
looked
shocked.
“He
asked
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch?”

Catelyn
said
nothing.
Let
Ned
work
it
out
in
his
own
mind;
her
voice
would
not
be
welcome
now.
Yet
gladly
would
she
have
kissed
the
maester
just
then.
His
was
the
perfect
solution.
Benjen
Stark
was
a
Sworn
Brother.
Jon
would
be
a
son
to
him,
the
child
he
would
never
have.
And
in
time
the
boy
would
take
the
oath
as
well.
He
would
father
no
sons
who
might
someday
contest
with
Catelyn’s
own
grandchildren
for
Winterfell.

Maester
Luwin
said,
“There
is
great
honor
in
service
on
the
Wall,
my
lord.”

“And
even
a
bastard
may
rise
high
in
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Ned
reflected.
Still,
his
voice
was
troubled.
“Jon
is
so
young.
If
he
asked
this
when
he
was
a
man
grown,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
a
boy
of
fourteen…”

“A
hard
sacrifice,”
Maester
Luwin
agreed.
“Yet
these
are
hard
times,
my
lord.
His
road
is
no
crueler
than
yours
or
your
lady’s.”

Catelyn
thought
of
the
three
children
she
must
lose.
It
was
not
easy
keeping
silent
then.

Ned
turned
away
from
them
to
gaze
out
the
window,
his
long
face
silent
and
thoughtful.
Finally
he
sighed,
and
turned
back.
“Very
well,”
he
said
to
Maester
Luwin.
“I
suppose
it
is
for
the
best.
I
will
speak
to
Ben.”

“When
shall
we
tell
Jon?”
the
maester
asked.

“When
I
must.
Preparations
must
be
made.
It
will
be
a
fortnight
before
we
are
ready
to
depart.
I
would
sooner
let
Jon
enjoy
these
last
few
days.
Summer
will
end
soon
enough,
and
childhood
as
well.
When
the
time
comes,
I
will
tell
him
myself.”





ARYA

Arya’s
stitches
were
crooked
again.

She
frowned
down
at
them
with
dismay
and
glanced
over
to
where
her
sister
Sansa
sat
among
the
other
girls.
Sansa’s
needlework
was
exquisite.
Everyone
said
so.
“Sansa’s
work
is
as
pretty
as
she
is,”
Septa
Mordane
told
their
lady
mother
once.
“She
has
such
fine,
delicate
hands.”
When
Lady
Catelyn
had
asked
about
Arya,
the
septa
had
sniffed.
“Arya
has
the
hands
of
a
blacksmith.”

Arya
glanced
furtively
across
the
room,
worried
that
Septa
Mordane
might
have
read
her
thoughts,
but
the
septa
was
paying
her
no
attention
today.
She
was
sitting
with
the
Princess
Myrcella,
all
smiles
and
admiration.
It
was
not
often
that
the
septa
was
privileged
to
instruct
a
royal
princess
in
the
womanly
arts,
as
she
had
said
when
the
queen
brought
Myrcella
to
join
them.
Arya
thought
that
Myrcella’s
stitches
looked
a
little
crooked
too,
but
you
would
never
know
it
from
the
way
Septa
Mordane
was
cooing.

She
studied
her
own
work
again,
looking
for
some
way
to
salvage
it,
then
sighed
and
put
down
the
needle.
She
looked
glumly
at
her
sister.
Sansa
was
chatting
away
happily
as
she
worked.
Beth
Cassel,
Ser
Rodrik’s
little
girl,
was
sitting
by
her
feet,
listening
to
every
word
she
said,
and
Jeyne
Poole
was
leaning
over
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear.

“What
are
you
talking
about?”
Arya
asked
suddenly.

Jeyne
gave
her
a
startled
look,
then
giggled.
Sansa
looked
abashed.
Beth
blushed.
No
one
answered.

“Tell
me,”
Arya
said.

Jeyne
glanced
over
to
make
certain
that
Septa
Mordane
was
not
listening.
Myrcella
said
something
then,
and
the
septa
laughed
along
with
the
rest
of
the
ladies.

“We
were
talking
about
the
prince,”
Sansa
said,
her
voice
soft
as
a
kiss.

Arya
knew
which
prince
she
meant:
Jofftey,
of
course.
The
tall,
handsome
one.
Sansa
got
to
sit
with
him
at
the
feast.
Arya
had
to
sit
with
the
little
fat
one.
Naturally.

“Joffrey
likes
your
sister,”
Jeyne
whispered,
proud
as
if
she
had
something
to
do
with
it.
She
was
the
daughter
of
Winterfell’s
steward
and
Sansa’s
dearest
friend.
“He
told
her
she
was
very
beautiful.”

“He’s
going
to
marry
her,”
little
Beth
said
dreamily,
hugging
herself.
“Then
Sansa
will
be
queen
of
all
the
realm.”

Sansa
had
the
grace
to
blush.
She
blushed
prettily.
She
did
everything
prettily,
Arya
thought
with
dull
resentment.
“Beth,
you
shouldn’t
make
up
stories,”
Sansa
corrected
the
younger
girl,
gently
stroking
her
hair
to
take
the
harshness
out
of
her
words.
She
looked
at
Arya.
“What
did
you
think
of
Prince
Joff,
sister?
He’s
very
gallant,
don’t
you
think?”

“Jon
says
he
looks
like
a
girl,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
sighed
as
she
stitched.
“Poor
Jon,”
she
said.
“He
gets
jealous
because
he’s
a
bastard.”

“He’s
our
brother,”
Arya
said,
much
too
loudly.
Her
voice
cut
through
the
afternoon
quiet
of
the
tower
room.

Septa
Mordane
raised
her
eyes.
She
had
a
bony
face,
sharp
eyes,
and
a
thin
lipless
mouth
made
for
frowning.
It
was
frowning
now.
“What
are
you
talking
about,
children?”

“Our
half
brother,”
Sansa
corrected,
soft
and
precise.
She
smiled
for
the
septa.
“Arya
and
I
were
remarking
on
how
pleased
we
were
to
have
the
princess
with
us
today,”
she
said.

Septa
Mordane
nodded.
“Indeed.
A
great
honor
for
us
all.”
Princess
Myrcella
smiled
uncertainly
at
the
compliment.
“Arya,
why
aren’t
you
at
work?”
the
septa
asked.
She
rose
to
her
feet,
starched
skirts
rustling
as
she
started
across
the
room.
“Let
me
see
your
stitches.”

Arya
wanted
to
scream.
It
was
just
like
Sansa
to
go
and
attract
the
septa’s
attention.
“Here,”
she
said,
surrendering
up
her
work.

The
septa
examined
the
fabric.
“Arya,
Arya,
Arya,”
she
said.
“This
will
not
do.
This
will
not
do
at
all.”

Everyone
was
looking
at
her.
It
was
too
much.
Sansa
was
too
well
bred
to
smile
at
her
sister’s
disgrace,
but
Jeyne
was
smirking
on
her
behalf.
Even
Princess
Myrcella
looked
sorry
for
her.
Arya
felt
tears
filling
her
eyes.
She
pushed
herself
out
of
her
chair
and
bolted
for
the
door.

Septa
Mordane
called
after
her.
“Arya,
come
back
here!
Don’t
you
take
another
step!
Your
lady
mother
will
hear
of
this.
In
front
of
our
royal
princess
too!
You’ll
shame
us
all!”

Arya
stopped
at
the
door
and
turned
back,
biting
her
lip.
The
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
now.
She
managed
a
stiff
little
bow
to
Myrcella.
“By
your
leave,
my
lady.”

Myrcella
blinked
at
her
and
looked
to
her
ladies
for
guidance.
But
if
she
was
uncertain,
Septa
Mordane
was
not.
“Just
where
do
you
think
you
are
going,
Arya?”
the
septa
demanded.

Arya
glared
at
her.
“I
have
to
go
shoe
a
horse,”
she
said
sweetly,
taking
a
brief
satisfaction
in
the
shock
on
the
septa’s
face.
Then
she
whirled
and
made
her
exit,
running
down
the
steps
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
take
her.

It
wasn’t
fair.
Sansa
had
everything.
Sansa
was
two
years
older;
maybe
by
the
time
Arya
had
been
born,
there
had
been
nothing
left.
Often
it
felt
that
way.
Sansa
could
sew
and
dance
and
sing.
She
wrote
poetry.
She
knew
how
to
dress.
She
played
the
high
harp
and
the
bells.
Worse,
she
was
beautiful.
Sansa
had
gotten
their
mother’s
fine
high
cheekbones
and
the
thick
auburn
hair
of
the
Tullys.
Arya
took
after
their
lord
father.
Her
hair
was
a
lusterless
brown,
and
her
face
was
long
and
solemn.
Jeyne
used
to
call
her
Arya
Horseface,
and
neigh
whenever
she
came
near.
It
hurt
that
the
one
thing
Arya
could
do
better
than
her
sister
was
ride
a
horse.
Well,
that
and
manage
a
household.
Sansa
had
never
had
much
of
a
head
for
figures.
If
she
did
marry
Prince
Joff,
Arya
hoped
for
his
sake
that
he
had
a
good
steward.

Nymeria
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
guardroom
at
the
base
of
the
stairs.
She
bounded
to
her
feet
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
Arya.
Arya
grinned.
The
wolf
pup
loved
her,
even
if
no
one
else
did.
They
went
everywhere
together,
and
Nymeria
slept
in
her
room,
at
the
foot
of
her
bed.
If
Mother
had
not
forbidden
it,
Arya
would
gladly
have
taken
the
wolf
with
her
to
needlework.
Let
Septa
Mordane
complain
about
her
stitches
then.

Nymeria
nipped
eagerly
at
her
hand
as
Arya
untied
her.
She
had
yellow
eyes.
When
they
caught
the
sunlight,
they
gleamed
like
two
golden
coins.
Arya
had
named
her
after
the
warrior
queen
of
the
Rhoyne,
who
had
led
her
people
across
the
narrow
sea.
That
had
been
a
great
scandal
too.
Sansa,
of
course,
had
named
her
pup
“Lady.”
Arya
made
a
face
and
hugged
the
wolfling
tight.
Nymeria
licked
her
ear,
and
she
giggled.

By
now
Septa
Mordane
would
certainly
have
sent
word
to
her
lady
mother.
If
she
went
to
her
room,
they
would
find
her.
Arya
did
not
care
to
be
found.
She
had
a
better
notion.
The
boys
were
at
practice
in
the
yard.
She
wanted
to
see
Robb
put
gallant
Prince
Joffrey
flat
on
his
back.
“Come,”
she
whispered
to
Nymeria.
She
got
up
and
ran,
the
wolf
coming
hard
at
her
heels.

There
was
a
window
in
the
covered
bridge
between
the
armory
and
the
Great
Keep
where
you
had
a
view
of
the
whole
yard.
That
was
where
they
headed.

They
arrived,
flushed
and
breathless,
to
find
Jon
seated
on
the
sill,
one
leg
drawn
up
languidly
to
his
chin.
He
was
watching
the
action,
so
absorbed
that
he
seemed
unaware
of
her
approach
until
his
white
wolf
moved
to
meet
them.
Nymeria
stalked
closer
on
wary
feet.
Ghost,
already
larger
than
his
litter
mates,
smelled
her,
gave
her
ear
a
careful
nip,
and
settled
back
down.

Jon
gave
her
a
curious
look.
“Shouldn’t
you
be
working
on
your
stitches,
little
sister?”

Arya
made
a
face
at
him.
“I
wanted
to
see
them
fight.”

He
smiled.
“Come
here,
then.”

Arya
climbed
up
on
the
window
and
sat
beside
him,
to
a
chorus
of
thuds
and
grunts
from
the
yard
below.

To
her
disappointment,
it
was
the
younger
boys
drilling.
Bran
was
so
heavily
padded
he
looked
as
though
he
had
belted
on
a
featherbed,
and
Prince
Tommen,
who
was
plump
to
begin
with,
seemed
positively
round.
They
were
huffing
and
puffing
and
hitting
at
each
other
with
padded
wooden
swords
under
the
watchful
eye
of
old
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,
the
master-at-arms,
a
great
stout
keg
of
a
man
with
magnificent
white
cheek
whiskers.
A
dozen
spectators,
man
and
boy,
were
calling
out
encouragement,
Robb’s
voice
the
loudest
among
them.
She
spotted
Theon
Greyjoy
beside
him,
his
black
doublet
emblazoned
with
the
golden
kraken
of
his
House,
a
look
of
wry
contempt
on
his
face.
Both
of
the
combatants
were
staggering.
Arya
judged
that
they
had
been
at
it
awhile.

“A
shade
more
exhausting
than
needlework,”
Jon
observed.

“A
shade
more
fun
than
needlework,”
Arya
gave
back
at
him.
Jon
grinned,
reached
over,
and
messed
up
her
hair.
Arya
flushed.
They
had
always
been
close.
Jon
had
their
father’s
face,
as
she
did.
They
were
the
only
ones.
Robb
and
Sansa
and
Bran
and
even
little
Rickon
all
took
after
the
Tullys,
with
easy
smiles
and
fire
in
their
hair.
When
Arya
had
been
little,
she
had
been
afraid
that
meant
that
she
was
a
bastard
too.
It
been
Jon
she
had
gone
to
in
her
fear,
and
Jon
who
had
reassured
her.

“Why
aren’t
you
down
in
the
yard?”
Arya
asked
him.

He
gave
her
a
half
smile.
“Bastards
are
not
allowed
to
damage
young
princes,”
he
said.
“Any
bruises
they
take
in
the
practice
yard
must
come
from
trueborn
swords.”

“Oh.”
Arya
felt
abashed.
She
should
have
realized.
For
the
second
time
today,
Arya
reflected
that
life
was
not
fair.

She
watched
her
little
brother
whack
at
Tommen.
“I
could
do
just
as
good
as
Bran,”
she
said.
“He’s
only
seven.
I’m
nine.”

Jon
looked
her
over
with
all
his
fourteen-year-old
wisdom.
“You’re
too
skinny,”
he
said.
He
took
her
arm
to
feel
her
muscle.
Then
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head.
“I
doubt
you
could
even
lift
a
longsword,
little
sister,
never
mind
swing
one.”

Arya
snatched
back
her
arm
and
glared
at
him.
Jon
messed
up
her
hair
again.
They
watched
Bran
and
Tommen
circle
each
other.

“You
see
Prince
Joffrey?”
Jon
asked.

She
hadn’t,
not
at
first
glance,
but
when
she
looked
again
she
found
him
to
the
back,
under
the
shade
of
the
high
stone
wall.
He
was
surrounded
by
men
she
did
not
recognize,
young
squires
in
the
livery
of
Lannister
and
Baratheon,
strangers
all.
There
were
a
few
older
men
among
them;
knights,
she
surmised.

“Look
at
the
arms
on
his
surcoat,”
Jon
suggested.

Arya
looked.
An
ornate
shield
had
been
embroidered
on
the
prince’s
padded
surcoat.
No
doubt
the
needlework
was
exquisite.
The
arms
were
divided
down
the
middle;
on
one
side
was
the
crowned
stag
of
the
royal
House,
on
the
other
the
lion
of
Lannister.

“The
Lannisters
are
proud,”
Jon
observed.
“You’d
think
the
royal
sigil
would
be
sufficient,
but
no.
He
makes
his
mother’s
House
equal
in
honor
to
the
king’s.”

“The
woman
is
important
too!”
Arya
protested.

Jon
chuckled.
“Perhaps
you
should
do
the
same
thing,
little
sister.
Wed
Tully
to
Stark
in
your
arms.”

“A
wolf
with
a
fish
in
its
mouth?”
It
made
her
laugh.
“That
would
look
silly.
Besides,
if
a
girl
can’t
fight,
why
should
she
have
a
coat
of
arms?”

Jon
shrugged.
“Girls
get
the
arms
but
not
the
swords.
Bastards
get
the
swords
but
not
the
arms.
I
did
not
make
the
rules,
little
sister.”

There
was
a
shout
from
the
courtyard
below.
Prince
Tommen
was
rolling
in
the
dust,
trying
to
get
up
and
failing.
All
the
padding
made
him
look
like
a
turtle
on
its
back.
Bran
was
standing
over
him
with
upraised
wooden
sword,
ready
to
whack
him
again
once
he
regained
his
feet.
The
men
began
to
laugh.

“Enough!”
Ser
Rodrik
called
out.
He
gave
the
prince
a
hand
and
yanked
him
back
to
his
feet.
“Well
fought.
Lew,
Donnis,
help
them
out
of
their
armor.”
He
looked
around.
“Prince
Joffrey,
Robb,
will
you
go
another
round?”

Robb,
already
sweaty
from
a
previous
bout,
moved
forward
eagerly.
“Gladly.”

Joffrey
moved
into
the
sunlight
in
response
to
Rodrik’s
summons.
His
hair
shone
like
spun
gold.
He
looked
bored.
“This
is
a
game
for
children,
Ser
Rodrik.”

Theon
Greyjoy
gave
a
sudden
bark
of
laughter.
“You
are
children,”
he
said
derisively.

“Robb
may
be
a
child,”
Joffrey
said.
“I
am
a
prince.
And
I
grow
tired
of
swatting
at
Starks
with
a
play
sword.”

“You
got
more
swats
than
you
gave,
Joff,”
Robb
said.
“Are
you
afraid?”

Prince
Joffrey
looked
at
him.
“Oh,
terrified,”
he
said.
“You’re
so
much
older.”
Some
of
the
Lannister
men
laughed.

Jon
looked
down
on
the
scene
with
a
frown.
“Joffrey
is
truly
a
little
shit,”
he
told
Arya.

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
thoughtfully
at
his
white
whiskers.
“What
are
you
suggesting?”
he
asked
the
prince.

“Live
steel.”

“Done,”
Robb
shot
back.
“You’ll
be
sorry!”

The
master-at-arms
put
a
hand
on
Robb’s
shoulder
to
quiet
him.
“Live
steel
is
too
dangerous.
I
will
permit
you
tourney
swords,
with
blunted
edges.”

Joffrey
said
nothing,
but
a
man
strange
to
Arya,
a
tall
knight
with
black
hair
and
burn
scars
on
his
face,
pushed
forward
in
front
of
the
prince.
“This
is
your
prince.
Who
are
you
to
tell
him
he
may
not
have
an
edge
on
his
sword,
ser?”

“Master-at-arms
of
Winterfell,
Clegane,
and
you
would
do
well
not
to
forget
it.”

“Are
you
training
women
here?”
the
burned
man
wanted
to
know.
He
was
muscled
like
a
bull.

“I
am
training
knights,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
pointedly.
“They
will
have
steel
when
they
are
ready.
When
they
are
of
an
age.”

The
burned
man
looked
at
Robb.
“How
old
are
you,
boy?”

“Fourteen,”
Robb
said.

“I
killed
a
man
at
twelve.
You
can
be
sure
it
was
not
with
a
blunt
sword.”

Arya
could
see
Robb
bristle.
His
pride
was
wounded.
He
turned
on
Ser
Rodrik.
“Let
me
do
it.
I
can
beat
him.”

“Beat
him
with
a
tourney
blade,
then,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

Joffrey
shrugged.
“Come
and
see
me
when
you’re
older,
Stark.
If
you’re
not
too
old.”
There
was
laughter
from
the
Lannister
men.

Robb’s
curses
rang
through
the
yard.
Arya
covered
her
mouth
in
shock.
Theon
Greyjoy
seized
Robb’s
arm
to
keep
him
away
from
the
prince.
Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers
in
dismay.

Joffrey
feigned
a
yawn
and
turned
to
his
younger
brother.
“Come,
Tommen,”
he
said.
“The
hour
of
play
is
done.
Leave
the
children
to
their
frolics.”

That
brought
more
laughter
from
the
Lannisters,
more
curses
from
Robb.
Ser
Rodrik’s
face
was
beet-red
with
fury
under
the
white
of
his
whiskers.
Theon
kept
Robb
locked
in
an
iron
grip
until
the
princes
and
their
party
were
safely
away.

Jon
watched
them
leave,
and
Arya
watched
Jon.
His
face
had
grown
as
still
as
the
pool
at
the
heart
of
the
godswood.
Finally
he
climbed
down
off
the
window.
“The
show
is
done,”
he
said.
He
bent
to
scratch
Ghost
behind
the
ears.
The
white
wolf
rose
and
rubbed
against
him.
“You
had
best
run
back
to
your
room,
little
sister.
Septa
Mordane
will
surely
be
lurking.
The
longer
you
hide,
the
sterner
the
penance.
You’ll
be
sewing
all
through
winter.
When
the
spring
thaw
comes,
they
will
find
your
body
with
a
needle
still
locked
tight
between
your
frozen
fingers.”

Arya
didn’t
think
it
was
funny.
“I
hate
needlework!”
she
said
with
passion.
“It’s
not
fair!”

“Nothing
is
fair,”
Jon
said.
He
messed
up
her
hair
again
and
walked
away
from
her,
Ghost
moving
silently
beside
him.
Nymeria
started
to
follow
too,
then
stopped
and
came
back
when
she
saw
that
Arya
was
not
coming.

Reluctantly
she
turned
in
the
other
direction.

It
was
worse
than
Jon
had
thought.
It
wasn’t
Septa
Mordane
waiting
in
her
room.
It
was
Septa
Mordane
and
her
mother.





BRAN

The
hunt
left
at
dawn.
The
king
wanted
wild
boar
at
the
feast
tonight.
Prince
Joffrey
rode
with
his
father,
so
Robb
had
been
allowed
to
join
the
hunters
as
well.
Uncle
Benjen,
Jory,
Theon
Greyjoy,
Ser
Rodrik,
and
even
the
queen’s
funny
little
brother
had
all
ridden
out
with
them.
It
was
the
last
hunt,
after
all.
On
the
morrow
they
left
for
the
south.

Bran
had
been
left
behind
with
Jon
and
the
girls
and
Rickon.
But
Rickon
was
only
a
baby
and
the
girls
were
only
girls
and
Jon
and
his
wolf
were
nowhere
to
be
found.
Bran
did
not
look
for
him
very
hard.
He
thought
Jon
was
angry
at
him.
Jon
seemed
to
be
angry
at
everyone
these
days.
Bran
did
not
know
why.
He
was
going
with
Uncle
Ben
to
the
Wall,
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch.
That
was
almost
as
good
as
going
south
with
the
king.
Robb
was
the
one
they
were
leaving
behind,
not
Jon.

For
days,
Bran
could
scarcely
wait
to
be
off.
He
was
going
to
ride
the
kingsroad
on
a
horse
of
his
own,
not
a
pony
but
a
real
horse.
His
father
would
be
the
Hand
of
the
King,
and
they
were
going
to
live
in
the
red
castle
at
King’s
Landing,
the
castle
the
Dragonlords
had
built.
Old
Nan
said
there
were
ghosts
there,
and
dungeons
where
terrible
things
had
been
done,
and
dragon
heads
on
the
walls.
It
gave
Bran
a
shiver
just
to
think
of
it,
but
he
was
not
afraid.
How
could
he
be
afraid?
His
father
would
be
with
him,
and
the
king
with
all
his
knights
and
sworn
swords.

Bran
was
going
to
be
a
knight
himself
someday,
one
of
the
Kingsguard.
Old
Nan
said
they
were
the
finest
swords
in
all
the
realm.
There
were
only
seven
of
them,
and
they
wore
white
armor
and
had
no
wives
or
children,
but
lived
only
to
serve
the
king.
Bran
knew
all
the
stories.
Their
names
were
like
music
to
him.
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield.
Ser
Ryam
Redwyne.
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight.
The
twins
Ser
Erryk
and
Ser
Arryk,
who
had
died
on
one
another’s
swords
hundreds
of
years
ago,
when
brother
fought
sister
in
the
war
the
singers
called
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons.
The
White
Bull,
Gerold
Hightower.
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
Barristan
the
Bold.

Two
of
the
Kingsguard
had
come
north
with
King
Robert.
Bran
had
watched
them
with
fascination,
never
quite
daring
to
speak
to
them.
Ser
Boros
was
a
bald
man
with
a
jowly
face,
and
Ser
Meryn
had
droopy
eyes
and
a
beard
the
color
of
rust.
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
looked
more
like
the
knights
in
the
stories,
and
he
was
of
the
Kingsguard
too,
but
Robb
said
he
had
killed
the
old
mad
king
and
shouldn’t
count
anymore.
The
greatest
living
knight
was
Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
Barristan
the
Bold,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.
Father
had
promised
that
they
would
meet
Ser
Barristan
when
they
reached
King’s
Landing,
and
Bran
had
been
marking
the
days
on
his
wall,
eager
to
depart,
to
see
a
world
he
had
only
dreamed
of
and
begin
a
life
he
could
scarcely
imagine.

Yet
now
that
the
last
day
was
at
hand,
suddenly
Bran
felt
lost.
Winterfell
had
been
the
only
home
he
had
ever
known.
His
father
had
told
him
that
he
ought
to
say
his
farewells
today,
and
he
had
tried.
After
the
hunt
had
ridden
out,
he
wandered
through
the
castle
with
his
wolf
at
his
side,
intending
to
visit
the
ones
who
would
be
left
behind,
Old
Nan
and
Gage
the
cook,
Mikken
in
his
smithy,
Hodor
the
stableboy
who
smiled
so
much
and
took
care
of
his
pony
and
never
said
anything
but
“Hodor,”
the
man
in
the
glass
gardens
who
gave
him
a
blackberry
when
he
came
to
visit…

But
it
was
no
good.
He
had
gone
to
the
stable
first,
and
seen
his
pony
there
in
its
stall,
except
it
wasn’t
his
pony
anymore,
he
was
getting
a
real
horse
and
leaving
the
pony
behind,
and
all
of
a
sudden
Bran
just
wanted
to
sit
down
and
cry.
He
turned
and
ran
off
before
Hodor
and
the
other
stableboys
could
see
the
tears
in
his
eyes.
That
was
the
end
of
his
farewells.
Instead
Bran
spent
the
morning
alone
in
the
godswood,
trying
to
teach
his
wolf
to
fetch
a
stick,
and
failing.
The
wolfling
was
smarter
than
any
of
the
hounds
in
his
father’s
kennel
and
Bran
would
have
sworn
he
understood
every
word
that
was
said
to
him,
but
he
showed
very
little
interest
in
chasing
sticks.

He
was
still
trying
to
decide
on
a
name.
Robb
was
calling
his
Grey
Wind,
because
he
ran
so
fast.
Sansa
had
named
hers
Lady,
and
Arya
named
hers
after
some
old
witch
queen
in
the
songs,
and
little
Rickon
called
his
Shaggydog,
which
Bran
thought
was
a
pretty
stupid
name
for
a
direwolf.
Jon’s
wolf,
the
white
one,
was
Ghost.
Bran
wished
he
had
thought
of
that
first,
even
though
his
wolf
wasn’t
white.
He
had
tried
a
hundred
names
in
the
last
fortnight,
but
none
of
them
sounded
right.

Finally
he
got
tired
of
the
stick
game
and
decided
to
go
climbing.
He
hadn’t
been
up
to
the
broken
tower
for
weeks
with
everything
that
had
happened,
and
this
might
be
his
last
chance.

He
raced
across
the
godswood,
taking
the
long
way
around
to
avoid
the
pool
where
the
heart
tree
grew.
The
heart
tree
had
always
frightened
him;
trees
ought
not
have
eyes,
Bran
thought,
or
leaves
that
looked
like
hands.
His
wolf
came
sprinting
at
his
heels.
“You
stay
here,”
he
told
him
at
the
base
of
the
sentinel
tree
near
the
armory
wall.
“Lie
down.
That’s
right.
Now
stay—”

The
wolf
did
as
he
was
told.
Bran
scratched
him
behind
the
ears,
then
turned
away,
jumped,
grabbed
a
low
branch,
and
pulled
himself
up.
He
was
halfway
up
the
tree,
moving
easily
from
limb
to
limb,
when
the
wolf
got
to
his
feet
and
began
to
howl.

Bran
looked
back
down.
His
wolf
fell
silent,
staring
up
at
him
through
slitted
yellow
eyes.
A
strange
chill
went
through
him.
He
began
to
climb
again.
Once
more
the
wolf
howled.
“Quiet,”
he
yelled.
“Sit
down.
Stay.
You’re
worse
than
Mother.”
The
howling
chased
him
all
the
way
up
the
tree,
until
finally
he
jumped
off
onto
the
armory
roof
and
out
of
sight.

The
rooftops
of
Winterfell
were
Bran’s
second
home.
His
mother
often
said
that
Bran
could
climb
before
he
could
walk.
Bran
could
not
remember
when
he
first
learned
to
walk,
but
he
could
not
remember
when
he
started
to
climb
either,
so
he
supposed
it
must
be
true.

To
a
boy,
Winterfell
was
a
grey
stone
labyrinth
of
walls
and
towers
and
courtyards
and
tunnels
spreading
out
in
all
directions.
In
the
older
parts
of
the
castle,
the
halls
slanted
up
and
down
so
that
you
couldn’t
even
be
sure
what
floor
you
were
on.
The
place
had
grown
over
the
centuries
like
some
monstrous
stone
tree,
Maester
Luwin
told
him
once,
and
its
branches
were
gnarled
and
thick
and
twisted,
its
roots
sunk
deep
into
the
earth.

When
he
got
out
from
under
it
and
scrambled
up
near
the
sky,
Bran
could
see
all
of
Winterfell
in
a
glance.
He
liked
the
way
it
looked,
spread
out
beneath
him,
only
birds
wheeling
over
his
head
while
all
the
life
of
the
castle
went
on
below.
Bran
could
perch
for
hours
among
the
shapeless,
rain-worn
gargoyles
that
brooded
over
the
First
Keep,
watching
it
all:
the
men
drilling
with
wood
and
steel
in
the
yard,
the
cooks
tending
their
vegetables
in
the
glass
garden,
restless
dogs
running
back
and
forth
in
the
kennels,
the
silence
of
the
godswood,
the
girls
gossiping
beside
the
washing
well.
It
made
him
feel
like
he
was
lord
of
the
castle,
in
a
way
even
Robb
would
never
know.

It
taught
him
Winterfell’s
secrets
too.
The
builders
had
not
even
leveled
the
earth;
there
were
hills
and
valleys
behind
the
walls
of
Winterfell.
There
was
a
covered
bridge
that
went
from
the
fourth
floor
of
the
bell
tower
across
to
the
second
floor
of
the
rookery.
Bran
knew
about
that.
And
he
knew
you
could
get
inside
the
inner
wall
by
the
south
gate,
climb
three
floors
and
run
all
the
way
around
Winterfell
through
a
narrow
tunnel
in
the
stone,
and
then
come
out
on
ground
level
at
the
north
gate,
with
a
hundred
feet
of
wall
looming
over
you.
Even
Maester
Luwin
didn’t
know
that,
Bran
was
convinced.

His
mother
was
terrified
that
one
day
Bran
would
slip
off
a
wall
and
kill
himself.
He
told
her
that
he
wouldn’t,
but
she
never
believed
him.
Once
she
made
him
promise
that
he
would
stay
on
the
ground.
He
had
managed
to
keep
that
promise
for
almost
a
fortnight,
miserable
every
day,
until
one
night
he
had
gone
out
the
window
of
his
bedroom
when
his
brothers
were
fast
asleep.

He
confessed
his
crime
the
next
day
in
a
fit
of
guilt.
Lord
Eddard
ordered
him
to
the
godswood
to
cleanse
himself.
Guards
were
posted
to
see
that
Bran
remained
there
alone
all
night
to
reflect
on
his
disobedience.
The
next
morning
Bran
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
They
finally
found
him
fast
asleep
in
the
upper
branches
of
the
tallest
sentinel
in
the
grove.

As
angry
as
he
was,
his
father
could
not
help
but
laugh.
“You’re
not
my
son,”
he
told
Bran
when
they
fetched
him
down,
“you’re
a
squirrel.
So
be
it.
If
you
must
climb,
then
climb,
but
try
not
to
let
your
mother
see
you.”

Bran
did
his
best,
although
he
did
not
think
he
ever
really
fooled
her.
Since
his
father
would
not
forbid
it,
she
turned
to
others.
Old
Nan
told
him
a
story
about
a
bad
little
boy
who
climbed
too
high
and
was
struck
down
by
lightning,
and
how
afterward
the
crows
came
to
peck
out
his
eyes.
Bran
was
not
impressed.
There
were
crows’
nests
atop
the
broken
tower,
where
no
one
ever
went
but
him,
and
sometimes
he
filled
his
pockets
with
corn
before
he
climbed
up
there
and
the
crows
ate
it
right
out
of
his
hand.
None
of
them
had
ever
shown
the
slightest
bit
of
interest
in
pecking
out
his
eyes.

Later,
Maester
Luwin
built
a
little
pottery
boy
and
dressed
him
in
Bran’s
clothes
and
flung
him
off
the
wall
into
the
yard
below,
to
demonstrate
what
would
happen
to
Bran
if
he
fell.
That
had
been
fun,
but
afterward
Bran
just
looked
at
the
maester
and
said,
“I’m
not
made
of
clay.
And
anyhow,
I
never
fall.”

Then
for
a
while
the
guards
would
chase
him
whenever
they
saw
him
on
the
roofs,
and
try
to
haul
him
down.
That
was
the
best
time
of
all.
It
was
like
playing
a
game
with
his
brothers,
except
that
Bran
always
won.
None
of
the
guards
could
climb
half
so
well
as
Bran,
not
even
Jory.
Most
of
the
time
they
never
saw
him
anyway.
People
never
looked
up.
That
was
another
thing
he
liked
about
climbing;
it
was
almost
like
being
invisible.

He
liked
how
it
felt
too,
pulling
himself
up
a
wall
stone
by
stone,
fingers
and
toes
digging
hard
into
the
small
crevices
between.
He
always
took
off
his
boots
and
went
barefoot
when
he
climbed;
it
made
him
feel
as
if
he
had
four
hands
instead
of
two.
He
liked
the
deep,
sweet
ache
it
left
in
the
muscles
afterward.
He
liked
the
way
the
air
tasted
way
up
high,
sweet
and
cold
as
a
winter
peach.
He
liked
the
birds:
the
crows
in
the
broken
tower,
the
tiny
little
sparrows
that
nested
in
cracks
between
the
stones,
the
ancient
owl
that
slept
in
the
dusty
loft
above
the
old
armory.
Bran
knew
them
all.

Most
of
all,
he
liked
going
places
that
no
one
else
could
go,
and
seeing
the
grey
sprawl
of
Winterfell
in
a
way
that
no
one
else
ever
saw
it.
It
made
the
whole
castle
Bran’s
secret
place.

His
favorite
haunt
was
the
broken
tower.
Once
it
had
been
a
watchtower,
the
tallest
in
Winterfell.
A
long
time
ago,
a
hundred
years
before
even
his
father
had
been
born,
a
lightning
strike
had
set
it
afire.
The
top
third
of
the
structure
had
collapsed
inward,
and
the
tower
had
never
been
rebuilt.
Sometimes
his
father
sent
ratters
into
the
base
of
the
tower,
to
clean
out
the
nests
they
always
found
among
the
jumble
of
fallen
stones
and
charred
and
rotten
beams.
But
no
one
ever
got
up
to
the
jagged
top
of
the
structure
now
except
for
Bran
and
the
crows.

He
knew
two
ways
to
get
there.
You
could
climb
straight
up
the
side
of
the
tower
itself,
but
the
stones
were
loose,
the
mortar
that
held
them
together
long
gone
to
ash,
and
Bran
never
liked
to
put
his
full
weight
on
them.

The
best
way
was
to
start
from
the
godswood,
shinny
up
the
tall
sentinel,
and
cross
over
the
armory
and
the
guards
hall,
leaping
roof
to
roof,
barefoot
so
the
guards
wouldn’t
hear
you
overhead.
That
brought
you
up
to
the
blind
side
of
the
First
Keep,
the
oldest
part
of
the
castle,
a
squat
round
fortress
that
was
taller
than
it
looked.
Only
rats
and
spiders
lived
there
now
but
the
old
stones
still
made
for
good
climbing.
You
could
go
straight
up
to
where
the
gargoyles
leaned
out
blindly
over
empty
space,
and
swing
from
gargoyle
to
gargoyle,
hand
over
hand,
around
to
the
north
side.
From
there,
if
you
really
stretched,
you
could
reach
out
and
pull
yourself
over
to
the
broken
tower
where
it
leaned
close.
The
last
part
was
the
scramble
up
the
blackened
stones
to
the
eyrie,
no
more
than
ten
feet,
and
then
the
crows
would
come
round
to
see
if
you’d
brought
any
corn.

Bran
was
moving
from
gargoyle
to
gargoyle
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
when
he
heard
the
voices.
He
was
so
startled
he
almost
lost
his
grip.
The
First
Keep
had
been
empty
all
his
life.

“I
do
not
like
it,”
a
woman
was
saying.
There
was
a
row
of
windows
beneath
him,
and
the
voice
was
drifting
out
of
the
last
window
on
this
side.
“You
should
be
the
Hand.”

“Gods
forbid,”
a
man’s
voice
replied
lazily.
“It’s
not
an
honor
I’d
want.
There’s
far
too
much
work
involved.”

Bran
hung,
listening,
suddenly
afraid
to
go
on.
They
might
glimpse
his
feet
if
he
tried
to
swing
by.

“Don’t
you
see
the
danger
this
puts
us
in?”
the
woman
said.
“Robert
loves
the
man
like
a
brother.”

“Robert
can
barely
stomach
his
brothers.
Not
that
I
blame
him.
Stannis
would
be
enough
to
give
anyone
indigestion.”

“Don’t
play
the
fool.
Stannis
and
Renly
are
one
thing,
and
Eddard
Stark
is
quite
another.
Robert
will
listen
to
Stark.
Damn
them
both.
I
should
have
insisted
that
he
name
you,
but
I
was
certain
Stark
would
refuse
him.”

“We
ought
to
count
ourselves
fortunate,”
the
man
said.
“The
king
might
as
easily
have
named
one
of
his
brothers,
or
even
Littlefinger,
gods
help
us.
Give
me
honorable
enemies
rather
than
ambitious
ones,
and
I’ll
sleep
more
easily
by
night.”

They
were
talking
about
Father,
Bran
realized.
He
wanted
to
hear
more.
A
few
more
feet…
but
they
would
see
him
if
he
swung
out
in
front
of
the
window.

“We
will
have
to
watch
him
carefully,”
the
woman
said.

“I
would
sooner
watch
you,”
the
man
said.
He
sounded
bored.
“Come
back
here.”

“Lord
Eddard
has
never
taken
any
interest
in
anything
that
happened
south
of
the
Neck,”
the
woman
said.
“Never.
I
tell
you,
he
means
to
move
against
us.
Why
else
would
he
leave
the
seat
of
his
power?”

“A
hundred
reasons.
Duty.
Honor.
He
yearns
to
write
his
name
large
across
the
book
of
history,
to
get
away
from
his
wife,
or
both.
Perhaps
he
just
wants
to
be
warm
for
once
in
his
life.”

“His
wife
is
Lady
Arryn’s
sister.
It’s
a
wonder
Lysa
was
not
here
to
greet
us
with
her
accusations.”

Bran
looked
down.
There
was
a
narrow
ledge
beneath
the
window,
only
a
few
inches
wide.
He
tried
to
lower
himself
toward
it.
Too
far.
He
would
never
reach.

“You
fret
too
much.
Lysa
Arryn
is
a
frightened
cow.”

“That
frightened
cow
shared
Jon
Arryn’s
bed.”

“If
she
knew
anything,
she
would
have
gone
to
Robert
before
she
fled
King’s
Landing.”

“When
he
had
already
agreed
to
foster
that
weakling
son
of
hers
at
Casterly
Rock?
I
think
not.
She
knew
the
boy’s
life
would
be
hostage
to
her
silence.
She
may
grow
bolder
now
that
he’s
safe
atop
the
Eyrie.”

“Mothers.”
The
man
made
the
word
sound
like
a
curse.
“I
think
birthing
does
something
to
your
minds.
You
are
all
mad.”
He
laughed.
It
was
a
bitter
sound.
“Let
Lady
Arryn
grow
as
bold
as
she
likes.
Whatever
she
knows,
whatever
she
thinks
she
knows,
she
has
no
proof.”
He
paused
a
moment.
“Or
does
she?”

“Do
you
think
the
king
will
require
proof?”
the
woman
said.
“I
tell
you,
he
loves
me
not.”

“And
whose
fault
is
that,
sweet
sister?”

Bran
studied
the
ledge.
He
could
drop
down.
It
was
too
narrow
to
land
on,
but
if
he
could
catch
hold
as
he
fell
past,
pull
himself
up…
except
that
might
make
a
noise,
draw
them
to
the
window.
He
was
not
sure
what
he
was
hearing,
but
he
knew
it
was
not
meant
for
his
ears.

“You
are
as
blind
as
Robert,”
the
woman
was
saying.

“If
you
mean
I
see
the
same
thing,
yes,”
the
man
said.
“I
see
a
man
who
would
sooner
die
than
betray
his
king.”

“He
betrayed
one
already,
or
have
you
forgotten?”
the
woman
said.
“Oh,
I
don’t
deny
he’s
loyal
to
Robert,
that’s
obvious.
What
happens
when
Robert
dies
and
Joff
takes
the
throne?
And
the
sooner
that
comes
to
pass,
the
safer
we’ll
all
be.
My
husband
grows
more
restless
every
day.
Having
Stark
beside
him
will
only
make
him
worse.
He’s
still
in
love
with
the
sister,
the
insipid
little
dead
sixteen-year-old.
How
long
till
he
decides
to
put
me
aside
for
some
new
Lyanna?”

Bran
was
suddenly
very
frightened.
He
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
go
back
the
way
he
had
come,
to
find
his
brothers.
Only
what
would
he
tell
them?
He
had
to
get
closer,
Bran
realized.
He
had
to
see
who
was
talking.

The
man
sighed.
“You
should
think
less
about
the
future
and
more
about
the
pleasures
at
hand.”

“Stop
that!”
the
woman
said.
Bran
heard
the
sudden
slap
of
flesh
on
flesh,
then
the
man’s
laughter.

Bran
pulled
himself
up,
climbed
over
the
gargoyle,
crawled
out
onto
the
roof.
This
was
the
easy
way.
He
moved
across
the
roof
to
the
next
gargoyle,
right
above
the
window
of
the
room
where
they
were
talking.

“All
this
talk
is
getting
very
tiresome,
sister,”
the
man
said.
“Come
here
and
be
quiet.”

Bran
sat
astride
the
gargoyle,
tightened
his
legs
around
it,
and
swung
himself
around,
upside
down.
He
hung
by
his
legs
and
slowly
stretched
his
head
down
toward
the
window.
The
world
looked
strange
upside
down.
A
courtyard
swam
dizzily
below
him,
its
stones
still
wet
with
melted
snow.

Bran
looked
in
the
window.

Inside
the
room,
a
man
and
a
woman
were
wrestling.
They
were
both
naked.
Bran
could
not
tell
who
they
were.
The
man’s
back
was
to
him,
and
his
body
screened
the
woman
from
view
as
he
pushed
her
up
against
a
wall.

There
were
soft,
wet
sounds.
Bran
realized
they
were
kissing.
He
watched,
wide-eyed
and
frightened,
his
breath
tight
in
his
throat.
The
man
had
a
hand
down
between
her
legs,
and
he
must
have
been
hurting
her
there,
because
the
woman
started
to
moan,
low
in
her
throat.
“Stop
it,”
she
said,
“stop
it,
stop
it.
Oh,
please…”
But
her
voice
was
low
and
weak,
and
she
did
not
push
him
away.
Her
hands
buried
themselves
in
his
hair,
his
tangled
golden
hair,
and
pulled
his
face
down
to
her
breast.

Bran
saw
her
face.
Her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
mouth
was
open,
moaning.
Her
golden
hair
swung
from
side
to
side
as
her
head
moved
back
and
forth,
but
still
he
recognized
the
queen.

He
must
have
made
a
noise.
Suddenly
her
eyes
opened,
and
she
was
staring
right
at
him.
She
screamed.

Everything
happened
at
once
then.
‘
The
woman
pushed
the
man
away
wildly,
shouting
and
pointing.
Bran
tried
to
pull
himself
up,
bending
double
as
he
reached
for
the
gargoyle.
He
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry.
His
hand
scraped
uselessly
across
smooth
stone,
and
in
his
panic
his
legs
slipped,
and
suddenly
he
was
failing.
There
was
an
instant
of
vertigo,
a
sickening
lurch
as
the
window
flashed
past.
He
shot
out
a
hand,
grabbed
for
the
ledge,
lost
it,
caught
it
again
with
his
other
hand.
He
swung
against
the
building,
hard.
The
impact
took
the
breath
out
of
him.
Bran
dangled,
one-handed,
panting.

Faces
appeared
in
the
window
above
him.

The
queen.
And
now
Bran
recognized
the
man
beside
her.
They
looked
as
much
alike
as
reflections
in
a
mirror.

“He
saw
us,”
the
woman
said
shrilly.

“So
he
did,”
the
man
said.

Bran’s
fingers
started
to
slip.
He
grabbed
the
ledge
with
his
other
hand.
Fingernails
dug
into
unyielding
stone.
The
man
reached
down.
“Take
my
hand,”
he
said.
“Before
you
fall.”

Bran
seized
his
arm
and
held
on
tight
with
all
his
strength.
The
man
yanked
him
up
to
the
ledge.
“What
are
you
doing?”
the
woman
demanded.

The
man
ignored
her.
He
was
very
strong.
He
stood
Bran
up
on
the
sill.
“How
old
are
you,
boy?”

“Seven,”
Bran
said,
shaking
with
relief.
His
fingers
had
dug
deep
gouges
in
the
man’s
forearm.
He
let
go
sheepishly.

The
man
looked
over
at
the
woman.
“The
things
I
do
for
love,”
he
said
with
loathing.
He
gave
Bran
a
shove.

Screaming,
Bran
went
backward
out
the
window
into
empty
air.
There
was
nothing
to
grab
on
to.
The
courtyard
rushed
up
to
meet
him.

Somewhere
off
in
the
distance,
a
wolf
was
howling.
Crows
circled
the
broken
tower,
waiting
for
corn.





TYRION

Somewhere
in
the
great
stone
maze
of
Winterfell,
a
wolf
howled.
The
sound
hung
over
the
castle
like
a
flag
of
mourning.

Tyrion
Lannister
looked
up
from
his
books
and
shivered,
though
the
library
was
snug
and
warm.
Something
about
the
howling
of
a
wolf
took
a
man
right
out
of
his
here
and
now
and
left
him
in
a
dark
forest
of
the
mind,
running
naked
before
the
pack.

When
the
direwolf
howled
again,
Tyrion
shut
the
heavy
leatherbound
cover
on
the
book
he
was
reading,
a
hundred-year-old
discourse
on
the
changing
of
the
seasons
by
a
long-dead
maester.
He
covered
a
yawn
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
His
reading
lamp
was
flickering,
its
oil
all
but
gone,
as
dawn
light
leaked
through
the
high
windows.
He
had
been
at
it
all
night,
but
that
was
nothing
new.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
much
a
one
for
sleeping.

His
legs
were
stiff
and
sore
as
he
eased
down
off
the
bench.
He
massaged
some
life
back
into
them
and
limped
heavily
to
the
table
where
the
septon
was
snoring
softly,
his
head
pillowed
on
an
open
book
in
front
of
him.
Tyrion
glanced
at
the
title.
A
life
of
the
Grand
Maester
Aethelmure,
no
wonder.
“Chayle,”
he
said
softly.
The
young
man
jerked
up,
blinking,
confused,
the
crystal
of
his
order
swinging
wildly
on
its
silver
chain.
“I’m
off
to
break
my
fast.
See
that
you
return
the
books
to
the
shelves.
Be
gentle
with
the
Valyrian
scrolls,
the
parchment
is
very
dry.
Ayrmidon’s
Engines
of
War
is
quite
rare,
and
yours
is
the
only
complete
copy
I’ve
ever
seen.”
Chayle
gaped
at
him,
still
half-asleep.
Patiently,
Tyrion
repeated
his
instructions,
then
clapped
the
septon
on
the
shoulder
and
left
him
to
his
tasks.

Outside,
Tyrion
swallowed
a
lungful
of
the
cold
morning
air
and
began
his
laborious
descent
of
the
steep
stone
steps
that
corkscrewed
around
the
exterior
of
the
library
tower.
It
was
slow
going;
the
steps
were
cut
high
and
narrow,
while
his
legs
were
short
and
twisted.
The
rising
sun
had
not
yet
cleared
the
walls
of
Winterfell,
but
the
men
were
already
hard
at
it
in
the
yard
below.
Sandor
Clegane’s
rasping
voice
drifted
up
to
him.
“The
boy
is
a
long
time
dying.
I
wish
he
would
be
quicker
about
it.”

Tyrion
glanced
down
and
saw
the
Hound
standing
with
young
Joffrey
as
squires
swarmed
around
them.
“At
least
he
dies
quietly,”
the
prince
replied.
“It’s
the
wolf
that
makes
the
noise.
I
could
scarce
sleep
last
night.”

Clegane
cast
a
long
shadow
across
the
hard-packed
earth
as
his
squire
lowered
the
black
helm
over
his
head.
“I
could
silence
the
creature,
if
it
please
you,”
he
said
through
his
open
visor.
His
boy
placed
a
longsword
in
his
hand.
He
tested
the
weight
of
it,
slicing
at
the
cold
morning
air.
Behind
him,
the
yard
rang
to
the
clangor
of
steel
on
steel.

The
notion
seemed
to
delight
the
prince.
“Send
a
dog
to
kill
a
dog!”
he
exclaimed.
“Winterfell
is
so
infested
with
wolves,
the
Starks
would
never
miss
one.”

Tyrion
hopped
off
the
last
step
onto
the
yard.
“I
beg
to
differ,
nephew,”
he
said.
“The
Starks
can
count
past
six.
Unlike
some
princes
I
might
name.”

Joffrey
had
the
grace
at
least
to
blush.

“A
voice
from
nowhere,”
Sandor
said.
He
peered
through
his
helm,
looking
this
way
and
that.
“Spirits
of
the
air!”

The
prince
laughed,
as
he
always
laughed
when
his
bodyguard
did
this
mummer’s
farce.
Tyrion
was
used
to
it.
“Down
here.”

The
tall
man
peered
down
at
the
ground,
and
pretended
to
notice
him.
“The
little
lord
Tyrion,”
he
said.
“My
pardons.
I
did
not
see
you
standing
there.”

“I
am
in
no
mood
for
your
insolence
today.”
Tyrion
turned
to
his
nephew.
“Joffrey,
it
is
past
time
you
called
on
Lord
Eddard
and
his
lady,
to
offer
them
your
comfort.”

Joffrey
looked
as
petulant
as
only
a
boy
prince
can
look.
“What
good
will
my
comfort
do
them?”

“None,”
Tyrion
said.
“Yet
it
is
expected
of
you.
Your
absence
has
been
noted.”

“The
Stark
boy
is
nothing
to
me,”
Joffrey
said.
“I
cannot
abide
the
wailing
of
women.”

Tyrion
Lannister
reached
up
and
slapped
his
nephew
hard
across
the
face.
The
boy’s
cheek
began
to
redden.

“One
word,”
Tyrion
said,
“and
I
will
hit
you
again.”

“I’m
going
to
tell
Mother!”
Joffrey
exclaimed.

Tyrion
hit
him
again.
Now
both
cheeks
flamed.

“You
tell
your
mother,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“But
first
you
get
yourself
to
Lord
and
Lady
Stark,
and
you
fall
to
your
knees
in
front
of
them,
and
you
tell
them
how
very
sorry
you
are,
and
that
you
are
at
their
service
if
there
is
the
slightest
thing
you
can
do
for
them
or
theirs
in
this
desperate
hour,
and
that
all
your
prayers
go
with
them.
Do
you
understand?
Do
you?”

The
boy
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
cry.
Instead,
he
managed
a
weak
nod.
Then
he
turned
and
fled
headlong
from
the
yard,
holding
his
cheek.
Tyrion
watched
him
run.

A
shadow
fell
across
his
face.
He
turned
to
find
Clegane
looming
overhead
like
a
cliff.
His
soot-dark
armor
seemed
to
blot
out
the
sun.
He
had
lowered
the
visor
on
his
helm.
It
was
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
a
snarling
black
hound,
fearsome
to
behold,
but
Tyrion
had
always
thought
it
a
great
improvement
over
Clegane’s
hideously
burned
face.

“The
prince
will
remember
that,
little
lord,”
the
Hound
warned
him.
The
helm
turned
his
laugh
into
a
hollow
rumble.

“I
pray
he
does,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied.
“If
he
forgets,
be
a
good
dog
and
remind
him.”
He
glanced
around
the
courtyard.
“Do
you
know
where
I
might
find
my
brother?”

“Breaking
fast
with
the
queen.”

“Ah,”
Tyrion
said.
He
gave
Sandor
Clegane
a
perfunctory
nod
and
walked
away
as
briskly
as
his
stunted
legs
would
carry
him,
whistling.
He
pitied
the
first
knight
to
try
the
Hound
today.
The
man
did
have
a
temper.

A
cold,
cheerless
meal
had
been
laid
out
in
the
morning
room
of
the
Guest
House.
Jaime
sat
at
table
with
Cersei
and
the
children,
talking
in
low,
hushed
voices.

“Is
Robert
still
abed?”
Tyrion
asked
as
he
seated
himself,
uninvited,
at
the
table.

His
sister
peered
at
him
with
the
same
expression
of
faint
distaste
she
had
worn
since
the
day
he
was
born.
“The
king
has
not
slept
at
all,”
she
told
him.
“He
is
with
Lord
Eddard.
He
has
taken
their
sorrow
deeply
to
heart.”

“He
has
a
large
heart,
our
Robert,”
Jaime
said
with
a
lazy
smile.
There
was
very
little
that
Jaime
took
seriously.
Tyrion
knew
that
about
his
brother,
and
forgave
it.
During
all
the
terrible
long
years
of
his
childhood,
only
Jaime
had
ever
shown
him
the
smallest
measure
of
affection
or
respect,
and
for
that
Tyrion
was
willing
to
forgive
him
most
anything.

A
servant
approached.
“Bread,”
Tyrion
told
him,
“and
two
of
those
little
fish,
and
a
mug
of
that
good
dark
beer
to
wash
them
down.
Oh,
and
some
bacon.
Burn
it
until
it
turns
black.”
The
man
bowed
and
moved
off.
Tyrion
turned
back
to
his
siblings.
Twins,
male
and
female.
They
looked
very
much
the
part
this
morning.
Both
had
chosen
a
deep
green
that
matched
their
eyes.
Their
blond
curls
were
all
a
fashionable
tumble,
and
gold
ornaments
shone
at
wrists
and
fingers
and
throats.

Tyrion
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
a
twin,
and
decided
that
he
would
rather
not
know.
Bad
enough
to
face
himself
in
a
looking
glass
every
day.
Another
him
was
a
thought
too
dreadful
to
contemplate.

Prince
Tommen
spoke
up.
“Do
you
have
news
of
Bran,
Uncle?”

“I
stopped
by
the
sickroom
last
night,”
Tyrion
announced.
“There
was
no
change.
The
maester
thought
that
a
hopeful
sign.”

“I
don’t
want
Brandon
to
die,”
Tommen
said
timorously.
He
was
a
sweet
boy.
Not
like
his
brother,
but
then
Jaime
and
Tyrion
were
somewhat
less
than
peas
in
a
pod
themselves.

“Lord
Eddard
had
a
brother
named
Brandon
as
well,”
Jaime
mused.
“One
of
the
hostages
murdered
by
Targaryen.
It
seems
to
be
an
unlucky
name.”

“Oh,
not
so
unlucky
as
all
that,
surely,”
Tyrion
said.
The
servant
brought
his
plate.
He
ripped
off
a
chunk
of
black
bread.

Cersei
was
studying
him
warily.
“What
do
you
mean?”

Tyrion
gave
her
a
crooked
smile.
“Why,
only
that
Tommen
may
get
his
wish.
The
maester
thinks
the
boy
may
yet
live.”
He
took
a
sip
of
beer.

Myrcella
gave
a
happy
gasp,
and
Tommen
smiled
nervously,
but
it
was
not
the
children
Tyrion
was
watching.
The
glance
that
passed
between
Jaime
and
Cersei
lasted
no
more
than
a
second,
but
he
did
not
miss
it.
Then
his
sister
dropped
her
gaze
to
the
table.
“That
is
no
mercy.
These
northern
gods
are
cruel
to
let
the
child
linger
in
such
pain.”

“What
were
the
maester’s
words?”
Jaime
asked.

The
bacon
crunched
when
he
bit
into
it.
Tyrion
chewed
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
said,
“He
thinks
that
if
the
boy
were
going
to
die,
he
would
have
done
so
already.
It
has
been
four
days
with
no
change.”

“Will
Bran
get
better,
Uncle?”
little
Myrcella
asked.
She
had
all
of
her
mother’s
beauty,
and
none
of
her
nature.

“His
back
is
broken,
little
one,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“The
fall
shattered
his
legs
as
well.
They
keep
him
alive
with
honey
and
water,
or
he
would
starve
to
death.
Perhaps,
if
he
wakes,
he
will
be
able
to
eat
real
food,
but
he
will
never
walk
again.”

“If
he
wakes,”
Cersei
repeated.
“Is
that
likely?”

“The
gods
alone
know,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“The
maester
only
hopes.”
He
chewed
some
more
bread.
“I
would
swear
that
wolf
of
his
is
keeping
the
boy
alive.
The
creature
is
outside
his
window
day
and
night,
howling.
Every
time
they
chase
it
away,
it
returns.
The
maester
said
they
closed
the
window
once,
to
shut
out
the
noise,
and
Bran
seemed
to
weaken.
When
they
opened
it
again,
his
heart
beat
stronger.”

The
queen
shuddered.
“There
is
something
unnatural
about
those
animals,”
she
said.
“They
are
dangerous.
I
will
not
have
any
of
them
coming
south
with
us.”

Jaime
said,
“You’ll
have
a
hard
time
stopping
them,
sister.
They
follow
those
girls
everywhere.”

Tyrion
started
on
his
fish.
“Are
you
leaving
soon,
then?”

“Not
near
soon
enough,”
Cersei
said.
Then
she
frowned.
“Are
we
leaving?”
she
echoed.
“What
about
you?
Gods,
don’t
tell
me
you
are
staying
here?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“Benjen
Stark
is
returning
to
the
Night’s
Watch
with
his
brother’s
bastard.
I
have
a
mind
to
go
with
them
and
see
this
Wall
we
have
all
heard
so
much
of.”

Jaime
smiled.
“I
hope
you’re
not
thinking
of
taking
the
black
on
us,
sweet
brother.”

Tyrion
laughed.
“What,
me,
celibate?
The
whores
would
go
begging
from
Dorne
to
Casterly
Rock.
No,
I
just
want
to
stand
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
piss
off
the
edge
of
the
world.”

Cersei
stood
abruptly.
“The
children
don’t
need
to
hear
this
filth.
Tommen,
Myrcella,
come.”
She
strode
briskly
from
the
morning
room,
her
train
and
her
pups
trailing
behind
her.

Jaime
Lannister
regarded
his
brother
thoughtfully
with
those
cool
green
eyes.
“Stark
will
never
consent
to
leave
Winterfell
with
his
son
lingering
in
the
shadow
of
death.”

“He
will
if
Robert
commands
it,”
Tyrion
said.
“And
Robert
will
command
it.
There
is
nothing
Lord
Eddard
can
do
for
the
boy
in
any
case.”

“He
could
end
his
torment,”
Jaime
said.
“I
would,
if
it
were
my
son.
It
would
be
a
mercy.”

“I
advise
against
putting
that
suggestion
to
Lord
Eddard,
sweet
brother,”
Tyrion
said.
“He
would
not
take
it
kindly.”

“Even
if
the
boy
does
live,
he
will
be
a
cripple.
Worse
than
a
cripple.
A
grotesque.
Give
me
a
good
clean
death.”

Tyrion
replied
with
a
shrug
that
accentuated
the
twist
of
his
shoulders.
“Speaking
for
the
grotesques,”
he
said,
“I
beg
to
differ.
Death
is
so
terribly
final,
while
life
is
full
of
possibilities.”

Jaime
smiled.
“You
are
a
perverse
little
imp,
aren’t
you?”

“Oh,
yes,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“I
hope
the
boy
does
wake.
I
would
be
most
interested
to
hear
what
he
might
have
to
say.”

His
brother’s
smile
curdled
like
sour
milk.
“Tyrion,
my
sweet
brother,”
he
said
darkly,
“there
are
times
when
you
give
me
cause
to
wonder
whose
side
you
are
on.”

Tyrion’s
mouth
was
full
of
bread
and
fish.
He
took
a
swallow
of
strong
black
beer
to
wash
it
all
down,
and
grinned
up
wolfishly
at
Jaime,
“Why,
Jaime,
my
sweet
brother,”
he
said,
“you
wound
me.
You
know
how
much
I
love
my
family.”





JON

Jon
climbed
the
steps
slowly,
trying
not
to
think
that
this
might
be
the
last
time
ever.
Ghost
padded
silently
beside
him.
Outside,
snow
swirled
through
the
castle
gates,
and
the
yard
was
all
noise
and
chaos,
but
inside
the
thick
stone
walls
it
was
still
warm
and
quiet.
Too
quiet
for
Jon’s
liking.

He
reached
the
landing
and
stood
for
a
long
moment,
afraid.
Ghost
nuzzled
at
his
hand.
He
took
courage
from
that.
He
straightened,
and
entered
the
room.

Lady
Stark
was
there
beside
his
bed.
She
had
been
there,
day
and
night,
for
close
on
a
fortnight.
Not
for
a
moment
had
she
left
Bran’s
side.
She
had
her
meals
brought
to
her
there,
and
chamber
pots
as
well,
and
a
small
hard
bed
to
sleep
on,
though
it
was
said
she
had
scarcely
slept
at
all.
She
fed
him
herself,
the
honey
and
water
and
herb
mixture
that
sustained
life.
Not
once
did
she
leave
the
room.
So
Jon
had
stayed
away.

But
now
there
was
no
more
time.

He
stood
in
the
door
for
a
moment,
afraid
to
speak,
afraid
to
come
closer.
The
window
was
open.
Below,
a
wolf
howled.
Ghost
heard
and
lifted
his
head.

Lady
Stark
looked
over.
For
a
moment
she
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him.
Finally
she
blinked.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”
she
asked
in
a
voice
strangely
flat
and
emotionless.

“I
came
to
see
Bran,”
Jon
said.
“To
say
good-bye.”

Her
face
did
not
change.
Her
long
auburn
hair
was
dull
and
tangled.
She
looked
as
though
she
had
aged
twenty
years.
“You’ve
said
it.
Now
go
away.”

Part
of
him
wanted
only
to
flee,
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
he
might
never
see
Bran
again.
He
took
a
nervous
step
into
the
room.
“Please,”
he
said.

Something
cold
moved
in
her
eyes.
“I
told
you
to
leave,”
she
said.
“We
don’t
want
you
here.”

Once
that
would
have
sent
him
running.
Once
that
might
even
have
made
him
cry.
Now
it
only
made
him
angry.
He
would
be
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
soon,
and
face
worse
dangers
than
Catelyn
Tully
Stark.
“He’s
my
brother,”
he
said.

“Shall
I
call
the
guards?”

“Call
them,”
Jon
said,
defiant.
“You
can’t
stop
me
from
seeing
him.”
He
crossed
the
room,
keeping
the
bed
between
them,
and
looked
down
on
Bran
where
he
lay.

She
was
holding
one
of
his
hands.
It
looked
like
a
claw.
This
was
not
the
Bran
he
remembered.
The
flesh
had
all
gone
from
him.
His
skin
stretched
tight
over
bones
like
sticks.
Under
the
blanket,
his
legs
bent
in
ways
that
made
Jon
sick.
His
eyes
were
sunken
deep
into
black
pits;
open,
but
they
saw
nothing.
The
fall
had
shrunken
him
somehow.
He
looked
half
a
leaf,
as
if
the
first
strong
wind
would
carry
him
off
to
his
grave.

Yet
under
the
frail
cage
of
those
shattered
ribs,
his
chest
rose
and
fell
with
each
shallow
breath.

“Bran,”
he
said,
“I’m
sorry
I
didn’t
come
before.
I
was
afraid.”
He
could
feel
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks.
Jon
no
longer
cared.
“Don’t
die,
Bran.
Please.
We’re
all
waiting
for
you
to
wake
up.
Me
and
Robb
and
the
girls,
everyone…”

Lady
Stark
was
watching.
She
had
not
raised
a
cry.
Jon
took
that
for
acceptance.
Outside
the
window,
the
direwolf
howled
again.
The
wolf
that
Bran
had
not
had
time
to
name.

“I
have
to
go
now,”
Jon
said.
“Uncle
Benjen
is
waiting.
I’m
to
go
north
to
the
Wall.
We
have
to
leave
today,
before
the
snows
come.”
He
remembered
how
excited
Bran
had
been
at
the
prospect
of
the
journey.
It
was
more
than
he
could
bear,
the
thought
of
leaving
him
behind
like
this.
Jon
brushed
away
his
tears,
leaned
over,
and
kissed
his
brother
lightly
on
the
lips.

“I
wanted
him
to
stay
here
with
me,”
Lady
Stark
said
softly.

Jon
watched
her,
wary.
She
was
not
even
looking
at
him.
She
was
talking
to
him,
but
for
a
part
of
her,
it
was
as
though
he
were
not
even
in
the
room.

“I
prayed
for
it,”
she
said
dully.
“He
was
my
special
boy.
I
went
to
the
sept
and
prayed
seven
times
to
the
seven
faces
of
god
that
Ned
would
change
his
mind
and
leave
him
here
with
me.
Sometimes
prayers
are
answered.”

Jon
did
not
know
what
to
say.
“It
wasn’t
your
fault,”
he
managed
after
an
awkward
silence.

Her
eyes
found
him.
They
were
full
of
poison.
“I
need
none
of
your
absolution,
bastard.”

Jon
lowered
his
eyes.
She
was
cradling
one
of
Bran’s
hands.
He
took
the
other,
squeezed
it.
Fingers
like
the
bones
of
birds.
“Good-bye,”
he
said.

He
was
at
the
door
when
she
called
out
to
him.
“Jon,”
she
said.
He
should
have
kept
going,
but
she
had
never
called
him
by
his
name
before.
He
turned
to
find
her
looking
at
his
face,
as
if
she
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time.

“Yes?”
he
said.

“It
should
have
been
you,”
she
told
him.
Then
she
turned
back
to
Bran
and
began
to
weep,
her
whole
body
shaking
with
the
sobs.
Jon
had
never
seen
her
cry
before.

It
was
a
long
walk
down
to
the
yard.

Outside,
everything
was
noise
and
confusion.
Wagons
were
being
loaded,
men
were
shouting,
horses
were
being
harnessed
and
saddled
and
led
from
the
stables.
A
light
snow
had
begun
to
fall,
and
everyone
was
in
an
uproar
to
be
off.

Robb
was
in
the
middle
of
it,
shouting
commands
with
the
best
of
them.
He
seemed
to
have
grown
of
late,
as
if
Bran’s
fall
and
his
mother’s
collapse
had
somehow
made
him
stronger.
Grey
Wind
was
at
his
side.

“Uncle
Benjen
is
looking
for
you,”
he
told
Jon.
“He
wanted
to
be
gone
an
hour
ago.”

“I
know,”
Jon
said.
“Soon.”
He
looked
around
at
all
the
noise
and
confusion.
“Leaving
is
harder
than
I
thought.”

“For
me
too,”
Robb
said.
He
had
snow
in
his
hair,
melting
from
the
heat
of
his
body.
“Did
you
see
him?”

Jon
nodded,
not
trusting
himself
to
speak.

“He’s
not
going
to
die,”
Robb
said.
“I
know
it.”

“You
Starks
are
hard
to
kill,”
Jon
agreed.
His
voice
was
flat
and
tired.
The
visit
had
taken
all
the
strength
from
him.

Robb
knew
something
was
wrong.
“My
mother…”

“She
was…
very
kind,”
Jon
told
him.

Robb
looked
relieved.
“Good.”
He
smiled.
“The
next
time
I
see
you,
you’ll
be
all
in
black.”

Jon
forced
himself
to
smile
back.
“It
was
always
my
color.
How
long
do
you
think
it
will
be?”

“Soon
enough,”
Robb
promised.
He
pulled
Jon
to
him
and
embraced
him
fiercely.
“Farewell,
Snow.”

Jon
hugged
him
back.
“And
you,
Stark.
Take
care
of
Bran.”

“I
will.”
They
broke
apart
and
looked
at
each
other
awkwardly.
“Uncle
Benjen
said
to
send
you
to
the
stables
if
I
saw
you,”
Robb
finally
said.

“I
have
one
more
farewell
to
make,”
Jon
told
him.

“Then
I
haven’t
seen
you,”
Robb
replied.
Jon
left
him
standing
there
in
the
snow,
surrounded
by
wagons
and
wolves
and
horses.
It
was
a
short
walk
to
the
armory.
He
picked
up
his
package
and
took
the
covered
bridge
across
to
the
Keep.

Arya
was
in
her
room,
packing
a
polished
ironwood
chest
that
was
bigger
than
she
was.
Nymeria
was
helping.
Arya
would
only
have
to
point,
and
the
wolf
would
bound
across
the
room,
snatch
up
some
wisp
of
silk
in
her
jaws,
and
fetch
it
back.
But
when
she
smelled
Ghost,
she
sat
down
on
her
haunches
and
yelped
at
them.

Arya
glanced
behind
her,
saw
Jon,
and
jumped
to
her
feet.
She
threw
her
skinny
arms
tight
around
his
neck.
“I
was
afraid
you
were
gone,”
she
said,
her
breath
catching
in
her
throat.
“They
wouldn’t
let
me
out
to
say
good-bye.”

“What
did
you
do
now?”
Jon
was
amused.

Arya
disentangled
herself
from
him
and
made
a
face.
“Nothing.
I
was
all
packed
and
everything.”
She
gestured
at
the
huge
chest,
no
more
than
a
third
full,
and
at
the
clothes
that
were
scattered
all
over
the
room.
“Septa
Mordane
says
I
have
to
do
it
all
over.
My
things
weren’t
properly
folded,
she
says.
A
proper
southron
lady
doesn’t
just
throw
her
clothes
inside
her
chest
like
old
rags,
she
says.”

“Is
that
what
you
did,
little
sister?”

“Well,
they’re
going
to
get
all
messed
up
anyway,”
she
said.
“Who
cares
how
they’re
folded?”

“Septa
Mordane,”
Jon
told
her.
“I
don’t
think
she’d
like
Nymeria
helping,
either.”
The
she-wolf
regarded
him
silently
with
her
dark
golden
eyes.
“It’s
just
as
well.
I
have
something
for
you
to
take
with
you,
and
it
has
to
be
packed
very
carefully.”

Her
face
lit
up.
“A
present?”

“You
could
call
it
that.
Close
the
door.”

Wary
but
excited,
Arya
checked
the
hall.
“Nymeria,
here.
Guard.”
She
left
the
wolf
out
there
to
warn
of
intruders
and
closed
the
door.
By
then
Jon
had
pulled
off
the
rags
he’d
wrapped
it
in.
He
held
it
out
to
her.

Arya’s
eyes
went
wide.
Dark
eyes,
like
his.
“A
sword,”
she
said
in
a
small,
hushed
breath.

The
scabbard
was
soft
grey
leather,
supple
as
sin.
Jon
drew
out
the
blade
slowly,
so
she
could
see
the
deep
blue
sheen
of
the
steel.
“This
is
no
toy,”
he
told
her.
“Be
careful
you
don’t
cut
yourself.
The
edges
are
sharp
enough
to
shave
with.”

“Girls
don’t
shave,”
Arya
said.

“Maybe
they
should.
Have
you
ever
seen
the
septa’s
legs?”

She
giggled
at
him.
“It’s
so
skinny.”

“So
are
you,”
Jon
told
her.
“I
had
Mikken
make
this
special.
The
bravos
use
swords
like
this
in
Pentos
and
Myr
and
the
other
Free
Cities.
It
won’t
hack
a
man’s
head
off,
but
it
can
poke
him
full
of
holes
if
you’re
fast
enough.”

“I
can
be
fast,”
Arya
said.

“You’ll
have
to
work
at
it
every
day.”
He
put
the
sword
in
her
hands,
showed
her
how
to
hold
it,
and
stepped
back.
“How
does
it
feel?
Do
you
like
the
balance?”

“I
think
so,”
Arya
said.

“First
lesson,”
Jon
said.
“Stick
them
with
the
pointy
end.”

Arya
gave
him
a
whap
on
the
arm
with
the
flat
of
her
blade.
The
blow
stung,
but
Jon
found
himself
grinning
like
an
idiot.
“I
know
which
end
to
use,”
Arya
said.
A
doubtful
look
crossed
her
face.
“Septa
Mordane
will
take
it
away
from
me.”

“Not
if
she
doesn’t
know
you
have
it,”
Jon
said.

“Who
will
I
practice
with?”

“You’ll
find
someone,”
Jon
promised
her.
“King’s
Landing
is
a
true
city,
a
thousand
times
the
size
of
Winterfell.
Until
you
find
a
partner,
watch
how
they
fight
in
the
yard.
Run,
and
ride,
make
yourself
strong.
And
whatever
you
do…”

Arya
knew
what
was
coming
next.
They
said
it
together.

“…don’t…
tell…
Sansa!”

Jon
messed
up
her
hair.
“I
will
miss
you,
little
sister.”

Suddenly
she
looked
like
she
was
going
to
cry.
“I
wish
you
were
coming
with
us.”

“Different
roads
sometimes
lead
to
the
same
castle.
Who
knows?”
He
was
feeling
better
now.
He
was
not
going
to
let
himself
be
sad.
“I
better
go.
I’ll
spend
my
first
year
on
the
Wall
emptying
chamber
pots
if
I
keep
Uncle
Ben
waiting
any
longer.”

Arya
ran
to
him
for
a
last
hug.
“Put
down
the
sword
first,”
Jon
warned
her,
laughing.
She
set
it
aside
almost
shyly
and
showered
him
with
kisses.

When
he
turned
back
at
the
door,
she
was
holding
it
again,
trying
it
for
balance.
“I
almost
forgot,”
he
told
her.
“All
the
best
swords
have
names.”

“Like
Ice,”
she
said.
She
looked
at
the
blade
in
her
hand.
“Does
this
have
a
name?
Oh,
tell
me.”

“Can’t
you
guess?”
Jon
teased.
“Your
very
favorite
thing.”

Arya
seemed
puzzled
at
first.
Then
it
came
to
her.
She
was
that
quick.
They
said
it
together:

“Needle!”

The
memory
of
her
laughter
warmed
him
on
the
long
ride
north.





DAENERYS

Daenerys
Targaryen
wed
Khal
Drogo
with
fear
and
barbaric
splendor
in
a
field
beyond
the
walls
of
Pentos,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.

Drogo
had
called
his
khalasar
to
attend
him
and
they
had
come,
forty
thousand
Dothraki
warriors
and
uncounted
numbers
of
women,
children,
and
slaves.
Outside
the
city
walls
they
camped
with
their
vast
herds,
raising
palaces
of
woven
grass,
eating
everything
in
sight,
and
making
the
good
folk
of
Pentos
more
anxious
with
every
passing
day.

“My
fellow
magisters
have
doubled
the
size
of
the
city
guard,”
Illyrio
told
them
over
platters
of
honey
duck
and
orange
snap
peppers
one
night
at
the
manse
that
had
been
Drogo’s.
The
khal
had
joined
his
khalasar,
his
estate
given
over
to
Daenerys
and
her
brother
until
the
wedding.

“Best
we
get
Princess
Daenerys
wedded
quickly
before
they
hand
half
the
wealth
of
Pentos
away
to
sellswords
and
bravos,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
jested.
The
exile
had
offered
her
brother
his
sword
the
night
Dany
had
been
sold
to
Kbal
Drogo;
Viserys
had
accepted
eagerly.
Mormont
had
been
their
constant
companion
ever
since.

Magister
Illyrio
laughed
lightly
through
his
forked
beard,
but
Viserys
did
not
so
much
as
smile.
“He
can
have
her
tomorrow,
if
he
likes,”
her
brother
said.
He
glanced
over
at
Dany,
and
she
lowered
her
eyes.
“So
long
as
he
pays
the
price.”

Illyrio
waved
a
languid
hand
in
the
air,
rings
glittering
on
his
fat
fingers.
“I
have
told
you,
all
is
settled.
Trust
me.
The
khal
has
promised
you
a
crown,
and
you
shall
have
it.”

“Yes,
but
when?”

“When
the
khal
chooses,”
Illyrio
said.
“He
will
have
the
girl
first,
and
after
they
are
wed
he
must
make
his
procession
across
the
plains
and
present
her
to
the
dosh
khaleen
at
Vaes
Dothrak.
After
that,
perhaps.
If
the
omens
favor
war.”

Viserys
seethed
with
impatience.
“I
piss
on
Dothraki
omens.
The
Usurper
sits
on
my
father’s
throne.
How
long
must
I
wait?”

Illyrio
gave
a
massive
shrug.
“You
have
waited
most
of
your
life,
great
king.
What
is
another
few
months,
another
few
years?”

Ser
Jorah,
who
had
traveled
as
far
east
as
Vaes
Dothrak,
nodded
in
agreement.
“I
counsel
you
to
be
patient,
Your
Grace.
The
Dothraki
are
true
to
their
word,
but
they
do
things
in
their
own
time.
A
lesser
man
may
beg
a
favor
from
the
khal,
but
must
never
presume
to
berate
him.”

Viserys
bristled.
“Guard
your
tongue,
Mormont,
or
I’ll
have
it
out.
I
am
no
lesser
man,
I
am
the
rightful
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
The
dragon
does
not
beg.”

Ser
Jorah
lowered
his
eyes
respectfully.
Illyrio
smiled
enigmatically
and
tore
a
wing
from
the
duck.
Honey
and
grease
ran
over
his
fingers
and
dripped
down
into
his
beard
as
he
nibbled
at
the
tender
meat.
There
are
no
more
dragons,
Dany
thought,
staring
at
her
brother,
though
she
did
not
dare
say
it
aloud.

Yet
that
night
she
dreamt
of
one.
Viserys
was
hitting
her,
hurting
her.
She
was
naked,
clumsy
with
fear.
She
ran
from
him,
but
her
body
seemed
thick
and
ungainly.
He
struck
her
again.
She
stumbled
and
fell.
“You
woke
the
dragon,”
he
screamed
as
he
kicked
her.
“You
woke
the
dragon,
you
woke
the
dragon.”
Her
thighs
were
slick
with
blood.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
whimpered.
As
if
in
answer,
there
was
a
hideous
ripping
sound
and
the
crackling
of
some
great
fire.
When
she
looked
again,
Viserys
was
gone,
great
columns
of
flame
rose
all
around,
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
the
dragon.
It
turned
its
great
head
slowly.
When
its
molten
eyes
found
hers,
she
woke,
shaking
and
covered
with
a
fine
sheen
of
sweat.
She
had
never
been
so
afraid…

…
until
the
day
of
her
wedding
came
at
last.

The
ceremony
began
at
dawn
and
continued
until
dusk,
an
endless
day
of
drinking
and
feasting
and
fighting.
A
mighty
earthen
ramp
had
been
raised
amid
the
grass
palaces,
and
there
Dany
was
seated
beside
Khal
Drogo,
above
the
seething
sea
of
Dothraki.
She
had
never
seen
so
many
people
in
one
place,
nor
people
so
strange
and
frightening.
The
horselords
might
put
on
rich
fabrics
and
sweet
perfumes
when
they
visited
the
Free
Cities,
but
out
under
the
open
sky
they
kept
the
old
ways.
Men
and
women
alike
wore
painted
leather
vests
over
bare
chests
and
horsehair
leggings
cinched
by
bronze
medallion
belts,
and
the
warriors
greased
their
long
braids
with
fat
from
the
rendering
pits.
They
gorged
themselves
on
horseflesh
roasted
with
honey
and
peppers,
drank
themselves
blind
on
fermented
mare’s
milk
and
Illyrio’s
fine
wines,
and
spat
jests
at
each
other
across
the
fires,
their
voices
harsh
and
alien
in
Dany’s
ears.

Viserys
was
seated
just
below
her,
splendid
in
a
new
black
wool
tunic
with
a
scarlet
dragon
on
the
chest.
Illyrio
and
Ser
Jorah
sat
beside
him.
Theirs
was
a
place
of
high
honor,
just
below
the
khal’s
own
bloodriders,
but
Dany
could
see
the
anger
in
her
brother’s
lilac
eyes.
He
did
not
like
sitting
beneath
her,
and
he
fumed
when
the
slaves
offered
each
dish
first
to
the
khal
and
his
bride,
and
served
him
from
the
portions
they
refused.
He
could
do
nothing
but
nurse
his
resentment,
so
nurse
it
he
did,
his
mood
growing
blacker
by
the
hour
at
each
insult
to
his
person.

Dany
had
never
felt
so
alone
as
she
did
seated
in
the
midst
of
that
vast
horde.
Her
brother
had
told
her
to
smile,
and
so
she
smiled
until
her
face
ached
and
the
tears
came
unbidden
to
her
eyes.
She
did
her
best
to
hide
them,
knowing
how
angry
Viserys
would
be
if
he
saw
her
crying,
terrified
of
how
Khal
Drogo
might
react.
Food
was
brought
to
her,
steaming
joints
of
meat
and
thick
black
sausages
and
Dothraki
blood
pies,
and
later
fruits
and
sweetgrass
stews
and
delicate
pastries
from
the
kitchens
of
Pentos,
but
she
waved
it
all
away.
Her
stomach
was
a
roil,
and
she
knew
she
could
keep
none
of
it
down.

There
was
no
one
to
talk
to.
Khal
Drogo
shouted
commands
and
jests
down
to
his
bloodriders,
and
laughed
at
their
replies,
but
he
scarcely
glanced
at
Dany
beside
him.
They
had
no
common
language.
Dothraki
was
incomprehensible
to
her,
and
the
khal
knew
only
a
few
words
of
the
bastard
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
and
none
at
all
of
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
She
would
even
have
welcomed
the
conversation
of
Illyrio
and
her
brother,
but
they
were
too
far
below
to
hear
her.

So
she
sat
in
her
wedding
silks,
nursing
a
cup
of
honeyed
wine,
afraid
to
eat,
talking
silently
to
herself.
I
am
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself.
I
am
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Princess
of
Dragonstone,
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror.

The
sun
was
only
a
quarter
of
the
way
up
the
sky
when
she
saw
her
first
man
die.
Drums
were
beating
as
some
of
the
women
danced
for
the
khal.
Drogo
watched
without
expression,
but
his
eyes
followed
their
movements,
and
from
time
to
time
he
would
toss
down
a
bronze
medallion
for
the
women
to
fight
over.

The
warriors
were
watching
too.
One
of
them
finally
stepped
into
the
circle,
grabbed
a
dancer
by
the
arm,
pushed
her
down
to
the
ground,
and
mounted
her
right
there,
as
a
stallion
mounts
a
mare.
Illyrio
had
told
her
that
might
happen.
“The
Dothraki
mate
like
the
animals
in
their
herds.
There
is
no
privacy
in
a
khalasar,
and
they
do
not
understand
sin
or
shame
as
we
do.”

Dany
looked
away
from
the
coupling,
frightened
when
she
realized
what
was
happening,
but
a
second
warrior
stepped
forward,
and
a
third,
and
soon
there
was
no
way
to
avert
her
eyes.
Then
two
men
seized
the
same
woman.
She
heard
a
shout,
saw
a
shove,
and
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
the
arakhs
were
out,
long
razor-sharp
blades,
half
sword
and
half
scythe.
A
dance
of
death
began
as
the
warriors
circled
and
slashed,
leaping
toward
each
other,
whirling
the
blades
around
their
heads,
shrieking
insults
at
each
clash.
No
one
made
a
move
to
interfere.

It
ended
as
quickly
as
it
began.
The
arakhs
shivered
together
faster
than
Dany
could
follow,
one
man
missed
a
step,
the
other
swung
his
blade
in
a
flat
arc.
Steel
bit
into
flesh
just
above
the
Dothraki’s
waist,
and
opened
him
from
backbone
to
belly
button,
spilling
his
entrails
into
the
dust.
As
the
loser
died,
the
winner
took
hold
of
the
nearest
woman—not
even
the
one
they
had
been
quarreling
over—and
had
her
there
and
then.
Slaves
carried
off
the
body,
and
the
dancing
resumed.

Magister
Illyrio
had
warned
Dany
about
this
too.
“A
Dothraki
wedding
without
at
least
three
deaths
is
deemed
a
dull
affair,”
he
had
said.
Her
wedding
must
have
been
especially
blessed;
before
the
day
was
over,
a
dozen
men
had
died.

As
the
hours
passed,
the
terror
grew
in
Dany,
until
it
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
scream.
She
was
afraid
of
the
Dothraki,
whose
ways
seemed
alien
and
monstrous,
as
if
they
were
beasts
in
human
skins
and
not
true
men
at
all.
She
was
afraid
of
her
brother,
of
what
he
might
do
if
she
failed
him.
Most
of
all,
she
was
afraid
of
what
would
happen
tonight
under
the
stars,
when
her
brother
gave
her
up
to
the
hulking
giant
who
sat
drinking
beside
her
with
a
face
as
still
and
cruel
as
a
bronze
mask.

I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself
again.

When
at
last
the
sun
was
low
in
the
sky,
Khal
Drogo
clapped
his
hands
together,
and
the
drums
and
the
shouting
and
feasting
came
to
a
sudden
halt.
Drogo
stood
and
pulled
Dany
to
her
feet
beside
him.
It
was
time
for
her
bride
gifts.

And
after
the
gifts,
she
knew,
after
the
sun
had
gone
down,
it
would
be
time
for
the
first
ride
and
the
consummation
of
her
marriage.
Dany
tried
to
put
the
thought
aside,
but
it
would
not
leave
her.
She
hugged
herself
to
try
to
keep
from
shaking.

Her
brother
Viserys
gifted
her
with
three
handmaids.
Dany
knew
they
had
cost
him
nothing;
Illyrio
no
doubt
had
provided
the
girls.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
were
copper-skinned
Dothraki
with
black
hair
and
almond-shaped
eyes,
Doreah
a
fair-haired,
blue-eyed
Lysene
girl.
“These
are
no
common
servants,
sweet
sister,”
her
brother
told
her
as
they
were
brought
forward
one
by
one.
“Illyrio
and
I
selected
them
personally
for
you.
Irri
will
teach
you
riding,
Jhiqui
the
Dothraki
tongue,
and
Doreah
will
instruct
you
in
the
womanly
arts
of
love.”
He
smiled
thinly.
“She’s
very
good,
Illyrio
and
I
can
both
swear
to
that.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
apologized
for
his
gift.
“It
is
a
small
thing,
my
princess,
but
all
a
poor
exile
could
afford,”
he
said
as
he
laid
a
small
stack
of
old
books
before
her.
They
were
histories
and
songs
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
she
saw,
written
in
the
Common
Tongue.
She
thanked
him
with
all
her
heart.

Magister
Illyrio
murmured
a
command,
and
four
burly
slaves
hurried
forward,
bearing
between
them
a
great
cedar
chest
bound
in
bronze.
When
she
opened
it,
she
found
piles
of
the
finest
velvets
and
damasks
the
Free
Cities
could
produce…
and
resting
on
top,
nestled
in
the
soft
cloth,
three
huge
eggs.
Dany
gasped.
They
were
the
most
beautiful
things
she
had
ever
seen,
each
different
than
the
others,
patterned
in
such
rich
colors
that
at
first
she
thought
they
were
crusted
with
jewels,
and
so
large
it
took
both
of
her
hands
to
hold
one.
She
lifted
it
delicately,
expecting
that
it
would
be
made
of
some
fine
porcelain
or
delicate
enamel,
or
even
blown
glass,
but
it
was
much
heavier
than
that,
as
if
it
were
all
of
solid
stone.
The
surface
of
the
shell
was
covered
with
tiny
scales,
and
as
she
turned
the
egg
between
her
fingers,
they
shimmered
like
polished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
One
egg
was
a
deep
green,
with
burnished
bronze
flecks
that
came
and
went
depending
on
how
Dany
turned
it.
Another
was
pale
cream
streaked
with
gold.
The
last
was
black,
as
black
as
a
midnight
sea,
yet
alive
with
scarlet
ripples
and
swirls.
“What
are
they?”
she
asked,
her
voice
hushed
and
full
of
wonder.

“Dragon’s
eggs,
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai,”
said
Magister
Illyrio.
“The
eons
have
turned
them
to
stone,
yet
still
they
burn
bright
with
beauty.”

“I
shall
treasure
them
always.”
Dany
had
heard
tales
of
such
eggs,
but
she
had
never
seen
one,
nor
thought
to
see
one.
It
was
a
truly
magnificent
gift,
though
she
knew
that
Illyrio
could
afford
to
be
lavish.
He
had
collected
a
fortune
in
horses
and
slaves
for
his
part
in
selling
her
to
Khal
Drogo.

The
khal’s
bloodriders
offered
her
the
traditional
three
weapons,
and
splendid
weapons
they
were.
Haggo
gave
her
a
great
leather
whip
with
a
silver
handle,
Cohollo
a
magnificent
arakh
chased
in
gold,
and
Qotho
a
double-curved
dragonbone
bow
taller
than
she
was.
Magister
Illyrio
and
Ser
Jorah
had
taught
her
the
traditional
refusals
for
these
offerings.
“This
is
a
gift
worthy
of
a
great
warrior,
O
blood
of
my
blood,
and
I
am
but
a
woman.
Let
my
lord
husband
bear
these
in
my
stead.”
And
so
Khal
Drogo
too
received
his
“bride
gifts.”

Other
gifts
she
was
given
in
plenty
by
other
Dothraki:
slippers
and
jewels
and
silver
rings
for
her
hair,
medallion
belts
and
painted
vests
and
soft
furs,
sandsilks
and
jars
of
scent,
needles
and
feathers
and
tiny
bottles
of
purple
glass,
and
a
gown
made
from
the
skin
of
a
thousand
mice.
“A
handsome
gift,
Khaleesi,”
Magister
Illyrio
said
of
the
last,
after
he
had
told
her
what
it
was.
“Most
lucky.”
The
gifts
mounted
up
around
her
in
great
piles,
more
gifts
than
she
could
possibly
imagine,
more
gifts
than
she
could
want
or
use.

And
last
of
all,
Khal
Drogo
brought
forth
his
own
bride
gift
to
her.
An
expectant
hush
rippled
out
from
the
center
of
the
camp
as
he
left
her
side,
growing
until
it
had
swallowed
the
whole
khalasar.
When
he
returned,
the
dense
press
of
Dothraki
gift-givers
parted
before
him,
and
he
led
the
horse
to
her.

She
was
a
young
filly,
spirited
and
splendid.
Dany
knew
just
enough
about
horses
to
know
that
this
was
no
ordinary
animal.
There
was
something
about
her
that
took
the
breath
away.
She
was
grey
as
the
winter
sea,
with
a
mane
like
silver
smoke.

Hesitantly
she
reached
out
and
stroked
the
horse’s
neck,
ran
her
fingers
through
the
silver
of
her
mane.
Khal
Drogo
said
something
in
Dothraki
and
Magister
Illyrio
translated.
“Silver
for
the
silver
of
your
hair,
the
khal
says.”

“She’s
beautiful,”
Dany
murmured.

“She
is
the
pride
of
the
khalasar,”
Illyrio
said.
“Custom
decrees
that
the
khaleesi
must
ride
a
mount
worthy
of
her
place
by
the
side
of
the
khal.”

Drogo
stepped
forward
and
put
his
hands
on
her
waist.
He
lifted
her
up
as
easily
as
if
she
were
a
child
and
set
her
on
the
thin
Dothraki
saddle,
so
much
smaller
than
the
ones
she
was
used
to.
Dany
sat
there
uncertain
for
a
moment.
No
one
had
told
her
about
this
part.
“What
should
I
do?”
she
asked
Illyrio.

It
was
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
who
answered.
“Take
the
reins
and
ride.
You
need
not
go
far.”

Nervously
Dany
gathered
the
reins
in
her
hands
and
slid
her
feet
into
the
short
stirrups.
She
was
only
a
fair
rider;
she
had
spent
far
more
time
traveling
by
ship
and
wagon
and
palanquin
than
by
horseback.
Praying
that
she
would
not
fall
off
and
disgrace
herself,
she
gave
the
filly
the
lightest
and
most
timid
touch
with
her
knees.

And
for
the
first
time
in
hours,
she
forgot
to
be
afraid.
Or
perhaps
it
was
for
the
first
time
ever.

The
silver-grey
filly
moved
with
a
smooth
and
silken
gait,
and
the
crowd
parted
for
her,
every
eye
upon
them.
Dany
found
herself
moving
faster
than
she
had
intended,
yet
somehow
it
was
exciting
rather
than
terrifying.
The
horse
broke
into
a
trot,
and
she
smiled.
Dothraki
scrambled
to
clear
a
path.
The
slightest
pressure
with
her
legs,
the
lightest
touch
on
the
reins,
and
the
filly
responded.
She
sent
it
into
a
gallop,
and
now
the
Dothraki
were
hooting
and
laughing
and
shouting
at
her
as
they
jumped
out
of
her
way.
As
she
turned
to
ride
back,
a
firepit
loomed
ahead,
directly
in
her
path.
They
were
hemmed
in
on
either
side,
with
no
room
to
stop.
A
daring
she
had
never
known
filled
Daenerys
then,
and
she
gave
the
filly
her
head.

The
silver
horse
leapt
the
flames
as
if
she
had
wings.

When
she
pulled
up
before
Magister
Illyrio,
she
said,
“Tell
Khal
Drogo
that
he
has
given
me
the
wind.”
The
fat
Pentoshi
stroked
his
yellow
beard
as
he
repeated
her
words
in
Dothraki,
and
Dany
saw
her
new
husband
smile
for
the
first
time.

The
last
sliver
of
sun
vanished
behind
the
high
walls
of
Pentos
to
the
west
just
then.
Dany
had
lost
all
track
of
time.
Khal
Drogo
commanded
his
bloodriders
to
bring
forth
his
own
horse,
a
lean
red
stallion.
As
the
khal
was
saddling
the
horse,
Viserys
slid
close
to
Dany
on
her
silver,
dug
his
fingers
into
her
leg,
and
said,
“Please
him,
sweet
sister,
or
I
swear,
you
will
see
the
dragon
wake
as
it
has
never
woken
before.”

The
fear
came
back
to
her
then,
with
her
brother’s
words.
She
felt
like
a
child
once
more,
only
thirteen
and
all
alone,
not
ready
for
what
was
about
to
happen
to
her.

They
rode
out
together
as
the
stars
came
out,
leaving
the
khalasar
and
the
grass
palaces
behind.
Khal
Drogo
spoke
no
word
to
her,
but
drove
his
stallion
at
a
hard
trot
through
the
gathering
dusk.
The
tiny
silver
bells
in
his
long
braid
rang
softly
as
he
rode.
“I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,”
she
whispered
aloud
as
she
followed,
trying
to
keep
her
courage
up.
“I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.”
The
dragon
was
never
afraid.

Afterward
she
could
not
say
how
far
or
how
long
they
had
ridden,
but
it
was
full
dark
when
they
stopped
at
a
grassy
place
beside
a
small
stream.
Drogo
swung
off
his
horse
and
lifted
her
down
from
hers.
She
felt
as
fragile
as
glass
in
his
hands,
her
limbs
as
weak
as
water.
She
stood
there
helpless
and
trembling
in
her
wedding
silks
while
he
secured
the
horses,
and
when
he
turned
to
look
at
her,
she
began
to
cry.

Khal
Drogo
stared
at
her
tears,
his
face
strangely
empty
of
expression.
“No,”
he
said.
He
lifted
his
hand
and
rubbed
away
the
tears
roughly
with
a
callused
thumb.

“You
speak
the
Common
Tongue,”
Dany
said
in
wonder.

“No,”
he
said
again.

Perhaps
he
had
only
that
word,
she
thought,
but
it
was
one
word
more
than
she
had
known
he
had,
and
somehow
it
made
her
feel
a
little
better.
Drogo
touched
her
hair
lightly,
sliding
the
silver-blond
strands
between
his
fingers
and
murmuring
softly
in
Dothraki.
Dany
did
not
understand
the
words,
yet
there
was
warmth
in
the
tone,
a
tenderness
she
had
never
expected
from
this
man.

He
put
his
finger
under
her
chin
and
lifted
her
head,
so
she
was
looking
up
into
his
eyes.
Drogo
towered
over
her
as
he
towered
over
everyone.
Taking
her
lightly
under
the
arms,
he
lifted
her
and
seated
her
on
a
rounded
rock
beside
the
stream.
Then
he
sat
on
the
ground
facing
her,
legs
crossed
beneath
him,
their
faces
finally
at
a
height.
“No,”
he
said.

“Is
that
the
only
word
you
know?”
she
asked
him.

Drogo
did
not
reply.
His
long
heavy
braid
was
coiled
in
the
dirt
beside
him.
He
pulled
it
over
his
right
shoulder
and
began
to
remove
the
bells
from
his
hair,
one
by
one.
After
a
moment
Dany
leaned
forward
to
help.
When
they
were
done,
Drogo
gestured.
She
understood.
Slowly,
carefully,
she
began
to
undo
his
braid.

It
took
a
long
time.
All
the
while
he
sat
there
silently,
watching
her.
When
she
was
done,
he
shook
his
head,
and
his
hair
spread
out
behind
him
like
a
river
of
darkness,
oiled
and
gleaming.
She
had
never
seen
hair
so
long,
so
black,
so
thick.

Then
it
was
his
turn.
He
began
to
undress
her.

His
fingers
were
deft
and
strangely
tender.
He
removed
her
silks
one
by
one,
carefully,
while
Dany
sat
unmoving,
silent,
looking
at
his
eyes.
When
he
bared
her
small
breasts,
she
could
not
help
herself.
She
averted
her
eyes
and
covered
herself
with
her
hands.
“No,”
Drogo
said.
He
pulled
her
hands
away
from
her
breasts,
gently
but
firmly,
then
lifted
her
face
again
to
make
her
look
at
him.
“No,”
he
repeated.

“No,”
she
echoed
back
at
him.

He
stood
her
up
then
and
pulled
her
close
to
remove
the
last
of
her
silks.
The
night
air
was
chilly
on
her
bare
skin.
She
shivered,
and
gooseflesh
covered
her
arms
and
legs.
She
was
afraid
of
what
would
come
next,
but
for
a
while
nothing
happened.
Khal
Drogo
sat
with
his
legs
crossed,
looking
at
her,
drinking
in
her
body
with
his
eyes.

After
a
while
he
began
to
touch
her.
Lightly
at
first,
then
harder.
She
could
sense
the
fierce
strength
in
his
hands,
but
he
never
hurt
her.
He
held
her
hand
in
his
own
and
brushed
her
fingers,
one
by
one.
He
ran
a
hand
gently
down
her
leg.
He
stroked
her
face,
tracing
the
curve
of
her
ears,
running
a
finger
gently
around
her
mouth.
He
put
both
hands
in
her
hair
and
combed
it
with
his
fingers.
He
turned
her
around,
massaged
her
shoulders,
slid
a
knuckle
down
the
path
of
her
spine.

It
seemed
as
if
hours
passed
before
his
hands
finally
went
to
her
breasts.
He
stroked
the
soft
skin
underneath
until
it
tingled.
He
circled
her
nipples
with
his
thumbs,
pinched
them
between
thumb
and
forefinger,
then
began
to
pull
at
her,
very
lightly
at
first,
then
more
insistently,
until
her
nipples
stiffened
and
began
to
ache.

He
stopped
then,
and
drew
her
down
onto
his
lap.
Dany
was
flushed
and
breathless,
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
chest.
He
cupped
her
face
in
his
huge
hands
and
looked
into
his
eyes.
“No?”
he
said,
and
she
knew
it
was
a
question.

She
took
his
hand
and
moved
it
down
to
the
wetness
between
her
thighs.
“Yes,”
she
whispered
as
she
put
his
finger
inside
her.





EDDARD

The
summons
came
in
the
hour
before
the
dawn,
when
the
world
was
still
and
grey.

Alyn
shook
him
roughly
from
his
dreams
and
Ned
stumbled
into
the
predawn
chill,
groggy
from
sleep,
to
find
his
horse
saddled
and
the
king
already
mounted.
Robert
wore
thick
brown
gloves
and
a
heavy
fur
cloak
with
a
hood
that
covered
his
ears,
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
bear
sitting
a
horse.
“Up,
Stark!”
he
roared.
“Up,
up!
We
have
matters
of
state
to
discuss.”

“By
all
means,”
Ned
said.
“Come
inside,
Your
Grace.”
Alyn
lifted
the
flap
of
the
tent.

“No,
no,
no,”
Robert
said.
His
breath
steamed
with
every
word.
“The
camp
is
full
of
ears.
Besides,
I
want
to
ride
out
and
taste
this
country
of
yours.”
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
waited
behind
him
with
a
dozen
guardsmen,
Ned
saw.
There
was
nothing
to
do
but
rub
the
sleep
from
his
eyes,
dress,
and
mount
up.

Robert
set
the
pace,
driving
his
huge
black
destrier
hard
as
Ned
galloped
along
beside
him,
trying
to
keep
up.
He
called
out
a
question
as
they
rode,
but
the
wind
blew
his
words
away,
and
the
king
did
not
hear
him.
After
that
Ned
rode
in
silence.
They
soon
left
the
kingsroad
and
took
off
across
rolling
plains
dark
with
mist.
By
then
the
guard
had
fallen
back
a
small
distance,
safely
out
of
earshot,
but
still
Robert
would
not
slow.

Dawn
broke
as
they
crested
a
low
ridge,
and
finally
the
king
pulled
up.
By
then
they
were
miles
south
of
the
main
party.
Robert
was
flushed
and
exhilarated
as
Ned
reined
up
beside
him.
“Gods,”
he
swore,
laughing,
“it
feels
good
to
get
out
and
ride
the
way
a
man
was
meant
to
ride!
I
swear,
Ned,
this
creeping
along
is
enough
to
drive
a
man
mad.”
He
had
never
been
a
patient
man,
Robert
Baratheon.
“That
damnable
wheelhouse,
the
way
it
creaks
and
groans,
climbing
every
bump
in
the
road
as
if
it
were
a
mountain…
I
promise
you,
if
that
wretched
thing
breaks
another
axle,
I’m
going
to
burn
it,
and
Cersei
can
walk!”

Ned
laughed.
“I
will
gladly
light
the
torch
for
you.”

“Good
man!”
The
king
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder.
“I’ve
half
a
mind
to
leave
them
all
behind
and
just
keep
going.”

A
smile
touched
Ned’s
lips.
“I
do
believe
you
mean
it.”

“I
do,
I
do,”
the
king
said.
“What
do
you
say,
Ned?
Just
you
and
me,
two
vagabond
knights
on
the
kingsroad,
our
swords
at
our
sides
and
the
gods
know
what
in
front
of
us,
and
maybe
a
farmer’s
daughter
or
a
tavern
wench
to
warm
our
beds
tonight.”

“Would
that
we
could,”
Ned
said,
“but
we
have
duties
now,
my
liege…
to
the
realm,
to
our
children,
I
to
my
lady
wife
and
you
to
your
queen.
We
are
not
the
boys
we
were.”

“You
were
never
the
boy
you
were,”
Robert
grumbled.
“More’s
the
pity.
And
yet
there
was
that
one
time…
what
was
her
name,
that
common
girl
of
yours?
Becca?
No,
she
was
one
of
mine,
gods
love
her,
black
hair
and
these
sweet
big
eyes,
you
could
drown
in
them.
Yours
was…
Aleena?
No.
You
told
me
once.
Was
it
Merryl?
You
know
the
one
I
mean,
your
bastard’s
mother?”

“Her
name
was
Wylla,”
Ned
replied
with
cool
courtesy,
“and
I
would
sooner
not
speak
of
her.”

“Wylla.
Yes.”
The
king
grinned.
“She
must
have
been
a
rare
wench
if
she
could
make
Lord
Eddard
Stark
forget
his
honor,
even
for
an
hour.
You
never
told
me
what
she
looked
like…”

Ned’s
mouth
tightened
in
anger.
“Nor
will
I.
Leave
it
be,
Robert,
for
the
love
you
say
you
bear
me.
I
dishonored
myself
and
I
dishonored
Catelyn,
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

“Gods
have
mercy,
you
scarcely
knew
Catelyn.”

“I
had
taken
her
to
wife.
She
was
carrying
my
child.”

“You
are
too
hard
on
yourself,
Ned.
You
always
were.
Damn
it,
no
woman
wants
Baelor
the
Blessed
in
her
bed.”
He
slapped
a
hand
on
his
knee.
“Well,
I’ll
not
press
you
if
you
feel
so
strong
about
it,
though
I
swear,
at
times
you’re
so
prickly
you
ought
to
take
the
hedgehog
as
your
sigil.”

The
rising
sun
sent
fingers
of
light
through
the
pale
white
mists
of
dawn.
A
wide
plain
spread
out
beneath
them,
bare
and
brown,
its
flatness
here
and
there
relieved
by
long,
low
hummocks.
Ned
pointed
them
out
to
his
king.
“The
barrows
of
the
First
Men.”

Robert
frowned.
“Have
we
ridden
onto
a
graveyard?”

“There
are
barrows
everywhere
in
the
north,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
told
him.
“This
land
is
old.”

“And
cold,”
Robert
grumbled,
pulling
his
cloak
more
tightly
around
himself.
The
guard
had
reined
up
well
behind
them,
at
the
bottom
of
the
ridge.
“Well,
I
did
not
bring
you
out
here
to
talk
of
graves
or
bicker
about
your
bastard.
There
was
a
rider
in
the
night,
from
Lord
Varys
in
King’s
Landing.
Here.”
The
king
pulled
a
paper
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Ned.

Varys
the
eunuch
was
the
king’s
master
of
whisperers.
He
served
Robert
now
as
he
had
once
served
Aerys
Targaryen.
Ned
unrolled
the
paper
with
trepidation,
thinking
of
Lysa
and
her
terrible
accusation,
but
the
message
did
not
concern
Lady
Arryn.
“What
is
the
source
for
this
information?”

“Do
you
remember
Ser
Jorah
Mormont?”

“Would
that
I
might
forget
him,”
Ned
said
bluntly.
The
Mormonts
of
Bear
Island
were
an
old
house,
proud
and
honorable,
but
their
lands
were
cold
and
distant
and
poor.
Ser
Jorah
had
tried
to
swell
the
family
coffers
by
selling
some
poachers
to
a
Tyroshi
slaver.
As
the
Mormonts
were
bannermen
to
the
Starks,
his
crime
had
dishonored
the
north.
Ned
had
made
the
long
journey
west
to
Bear
Island,
only
to
find
when
he
arrived
that
Jorah
had
taken
ship
beyond
the
reach
of
Ice
and
the
king’s
justice.
Five
years
had
passed
since
then.

“Ser
Jorah
is
now
in
Pentos,
anxious
to
earn
a
royal
pardon
that
would
allow
him
to
return
from
exile,”
Robert
explained.
“Lord
Varys
makes
good
use
of
him.”

“So
the
slaver
has
become
a
spy,”
Ned
said
with
distaste.
He
handed
the
letter
back.
“I
would
rather
he
become
a
corpse.”

“Varys
tells
me
that
spies
are
more
useful
than
corpses,”
Robert
said.
“Jorah
aside,
what
do
you
make
of
his
report?”

“Daenerys
Targaryen
has
wed
some
Dothraki
horselord.
What
of
it?
Shall
we
send
her
a
wedding
gift?”

The
king
frowned.
“A
knife,
perhaps.
A
good
sharp
one,
and
a
bold
man
to
wield
it.”

Ned
did
not
feign
surprise;
Robert’s
hatred
of
the
Targaryens
was
a
madness
in
him.
He
remembered
the
angry
words
they
had
exchanged
when
Tywin
Lannister
had
presented
Robert
with
the
corpses
of
Rhaegar’s
wife
and
children
as
a
token
of
fealty.
Ned
had
named
that
murder;
Robert
called
it
war.
When
he
had
protested
that
the
young
prince
and
princess
were
no
more
than
babes,
his
new-made
king
had
replied,
“I
see
no
babes.
Only
dragonspawn.”
Not
even
Jon
Arryn
had
been
able
to
calm
that
storm.
Eddard
Stark
had
ridden
out
that
very
day
in
a
cold
rage,
to
fight
the
last
battles
of
the
war
alone
in
the
south.
It
had
taken
another
death
to
reconcile
them;
Lyanna’s
death,
and
the
grief
they
had
shared
over
her
passing.

This
time,
Ned
resolved
to
keep
his
temper.
“Your
Grace,
the
girl
is
scarcely
more
than
a
child.
You
are
no
Tywin
Lannister,
to
slaughter
innocents.”
It
was
said
that
Rhaegar’s
little
girl
had
cried
as
they
dragged
her
from
beneath
her
bed
to
face
the
swords.
The
boy
had
been
no
more
than
a
babe
in
arms,
yet
Lord
Tywin’s
soldiers
had
torn
him
from
his
mother’s
breast
and
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.

“And
how
long
will
this
one
remain
an
innocent?”
Robert’s
mouth
grew
hard.
“This
child
will
soon
enough
spread
her
legs
and
start
breeding
more
dragonspawn
to
plague
me.”

“Nonetheless,”
Ned
said,
“the
murder
of
children…
it
would
be
vile…
unspeakable…”

“Unspeakable?”
the
king
roared.
“What
Aerys
did
to
your
brother
Brandon
was
unspeakable.
The
way
your
lord
father
died,
that
was
unspeakable.
And
Rhaegar…
how
many
times
do
you
think
he
raped
your
sister?
How
many
hundreds
of
times?”
His
voice
had
grown
so
loud
that
his
horse
whinnied
nervously
beneath
him.
The
king
jerked
the
reins
hard,
quieting
the
animal,
and
pointed
an
angry
finger
at
Ned.
“I
will
kill
every
Targaryen
I
can
get
my
hands
on,
until
they
are
as
dead
as
their
dragons,
and
then
I
will
piss
on
their
graves.”

Ned
knew
better
than
to
defy
him
when
the
wrath
was
on
him.
If
the
years
had
not
quenched
Robert’s
thirst
for
revenge,
no
words
of
his
would
help.
“You
can’t
get
your
hands
on
this
one,
can
you?”
he
said
quietly.

The
king’s
mouth
twisted
in
a
bitter
grimace.
“No,
gods
be
cursed.
Some
pox-ridden
Pentoshi
cheesemonger
had
her
brother
and
her
walled
up
on
his
estate
with
pointy-hatted
eunuchs
all
around
them,
and
now
he’s
handed
them
over
to
the
Dothraki.
I
should
have
had
them
both
killed
years
ago,
when
it
was
easy
to
get
at
them,
but
Jon
was
as
bad
as
you.
More
fool
I,
I
listened
to
him.”

“Jon
Arryn
was
a
wise
man
and
a
good
Hand.”

Robert
snorted.
The
anger
was
leaving
him
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come.
“This
Khal
Drogo
is
said
to
have
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
his
horde.
What
would
Jon
say
to
that?”

“He
would
say
that
even
a
million
Dothraki
are
no
threat
to
the
realm,
so
long
as
they
remain
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
sea,”
Ned
replied
calmly.
“The
barbarians
have
no
ships.
They
hate
and
fear
the
open
sea.”

The
king
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
saddle.
“Perhaps.
There
are
ships
to
be
had
in
the
Free
Cities,
though.
I
tell
you,
Ned,
I
do
not
like
this
marriage.
There
are
still
those
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
call
me
Usurper.
Do
you
forget
how
many
houses
fought
for
Targaryen
in
the
war?
They
bide
their
time
for
now,
but
give
them
half
a
chance,
they
will
murder
me
in
my
bed,
and
my
sons
with
me.
If
the
beggar
king
crosses
with
a
Dothraki
horde
at
his
back,
the
traitors
will
join
him.”

“He
will
not
cross,”
Ned
promised.
“And
if
by
some
mischance
he
does,
we
will
throw
him
back
into
the
sea.
Once
you
choose
a
new
Warden
of
the
East—”

The
king
groaned.
“For
the
last
time,
I
will
not
name
the
Arryn
boy
Warden.
I
know
the
boy
is
your
nephew,
but
with
Targaryens
climbing
in
bed
with
Dothraki,
I
would
be
mad
to
rest
one
quarter
of
the
realm
on
the
shoulders
of
a
sickly
child.”

Ned
was
ready
for
that.
“Yet
we
still
must
have
a
Warden
of
the
East.
If
Robert
Arryn
will
not
do,
name
one
of
your
brothers.
Stannis
proved
himself
at
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End,
surely.”

He
let
the
name
hang
there
for
a
moment.
The
king
frowned
and
said
nothing.
He
looked
uncomfortable.

“That
is,”
Ned
finished
quietly,
watching,
“unless
you
have
already
promised
the
honor
to
another.”

For
a
moment
Robert
had
the
grace
to
look
startled.
Just
as
quickly,
the
look
became
annoyance.
“What
if
I
have?”

“It’s
Jaime
Lannister,
is
it
not?”

Robert
kicked
his
horse
back
into
motion
and
started
down
the
ridge
toward
the
barrows.
Ned
kept
pace
with
him.
The
king
rode
on,
eyes
straight
ahead.
“Yes,”
he
said
at
last.
A
single
hard
word
to
end
the
matter.

“Kingslayer,”
Ned
said.
The
rumors
were
true,
then.
He
rode
on
dangerous
ground
now,
he
knew.
“An
able
and
courageous
man,
no
doubt,”
he
said
carefully,
“but
his
father
is
Warden
of
the
West,
Robert.
In
time
Ser
Jaime
will
succeed
to
that
honor.
No
one
man
should
hold
both
East
and
West.”
He
left
unsaid
his
real
concern;
that
the
appointment
would
put
half
the
armies
of
the
realm
into
the
hands
of
Lannisters.

“I
will
fight
that
battle
when
the
enemy
appears
on
the
field,”
the
king
said
stubbornly.
“At
the
moment,
Lord
Tywin
looms
eternal
as
Casterly
Rock,
so
I
doubt
that
Jaime
will
be
succeeding
anytime
soon.
Don’t
vex
me
about
this,
Ned,
the
stone
has
been
set.”

“Your
Grace,
may
I
speak
frankly?”

“I
seem
unable
to
stop
you,”
Robert
grumbled.
They
rode
through
tall
brown
grasses.

“Can
you
trust
Jaime
Lannister?”

“He
is
my
wife’s
twin,
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Kingsguard,
his
life
and
fortune
and
honor
all
bound
to
mine.”

“As
they
were
bound
to
Aerys
Targaryen’s,”
Ned
pointed
out.

“Why
should
I
mistrust
him?
He
has
done
everything
I
have
ever
asked
of
him.
His
sword
helped
win
the
throne
I
sit
on.”

His
sword
helped
taint
the
throne
you
sit
on,
Ned
thought,
but
he
did
not
permit
the
words
to
pass
his
lips.
“He
swore
a
vow
to
protect
his
king’s
life
with
his
own.
Then
he
opened
that
king’s
throat
with
a
sword.”

“Seven
hells,
someone
had
to
kill
Aerys!”
Robert
said,
reining
his
mount
to
a
sudden
halt
beside
an
ancient
barrow.
“If
Jaime
hadn’t
done
it,
it
would
have
been
left
for
you
or
me.”

“We
were
not
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
Kingsguard,”
Ned
said.
The
time
had
come
for
Robert
to
hear
the
whole
truth,
he
decided
then
and
there.
“Do
you
remember
the
Trident,
Your
Grace?”

“I
won
my
crown
there.
How
should
I
forget
it?”

“You
took
a
wound
from
Rhaegar,”
Ned
reminded
him.
“So
when
the
Targaryen
host
broke
and
ran,
you
gave
the
pursuit
into
my
hands.
The
remnants
of
Rhaegar’s
army
fled
back
to
King’s
Landing.
We
followed.
Aerys
was
in
the
Red
Keep
with
several
thousand
loyalists.
I
expected
to
find
the
gates
closed
to
us.”

Robert
gave
an
impatient
shake
of
his
head.
“Instead
you
found
that
our
men
had
already
taken
the
city.
What
of
it?”

“Not
our
men,”
Ned
said
patiently.
“Lannister
men.
The
lion
of
Lannister
flew
over
the
ramparts,
not
the
crowned
stag.
And
they
had
taken
the
city
by
treachery.”

The
war
had
raged
for
close
to
a
year.
Lords
great
and
small
had
flocked
to
Robert’s
banners;
others
had
remained
loyal
to
Targaryen.
The
mighty
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock,
the
Wardens
of
the
West,
had
remained
aloof
from
the
struggle,
ignoring
calls
to
arms
from
both
rebels
and
royalists.
Aerys
Targaryen
must
have
thought
that
his
gods
had
answered
his
prayers
when
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
appeared
before
the
gates
of
King’s
Landing
with
an
army
twelve
thousand
strong,
professing
loyalty.
So
the
mad
king
had
ordered
his
last
mad
act.
He
had
opened
his
city
to
the
lions
at
the
gate.

“Treachery
was
a
coin
the
Targaryens
knew
well,”
Robert
said.
The
anger
was
building
in
him
again.
“Lannister
paid
them
back
in
kind.
It
was
no
less
than
they
deserved.
I
shall
not
trouble
my
sleep
over
it.”

“You
were
not
there,”
Ned
said,
bitterness
in
his
voice.
Troubled
sleep
was
no
stranger
to
him.
He
had
lived
his
lies
for
fourteen
years,
yet
they
still
haunted
him
at
night.
“There
was
no
honor
in
that
conquest.”

“The
Others
take
your
honor!”
Robert
swore.
“What
did
any
Targaryen
ever
know
of
honor?
Go
down
into
your
crypt
and
ask
Lyanna
about
the
dragon’s
honor!”

“You
avenged
Lyanna
at
the
Trident,”
Ned
said,
halting
beside
the
king.
Promise
me,
Ned,
she
had
whispered.

“That
did
not
bring
her
back.”
Robert
looked
away,
off
into
the
grey
distance.
“The
gods
be
damned.
It
was
a
hollow
victory
they
gave
me.
A
crown…
it
was
the
girl
I
prayed
them
for.
Your
sister,
safe…
and
mine
again,
as
she
was
meant
to
be.
I
ask
you,
Ned,
what
good
is
it
to
wear
a
crown?
The
gods
mock
the
prayers
of
kings
and
cowherds
alike.”

“I
cannot
answer
for
the
gods,
Your
Grace…
only
for
what
I
found
when
I
rode
into
the
throne
room
that
day,”
Ned
said.
“Aerys
was
dead
on
the
floor,
drowned
in
his
own
blood.
His
dragon
skulls
stared
down
from
the
walls.
Lannister’s
men
were
everywhere.
Jaime
wore
the
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
over
his
golden
armor.
I
can
see
him
still.
Even
his
sword
was
gilded.
He
was
seated
on
the
Iron
Throne,
high
above
his
knights,
wearing
a
helm
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
a
lion’s
head.
How
he
glittered!”

“This
is
well
known,”
the
king
complained.

“I
was
still
mounted.
I
rode
the
length
of
the
hall
in
silence,
between
the
long
rows
of
dragon
skulls.
It
felt
as
though
they
were
watching
me,
somehow.
I
stopped
in
front
of
the
throne,
looking
up
at
him.
His
golden
sword
was
across
his
legs,
its
edge
red
with
a
king’s
blood.
My
men
were
filling
the
room
behind
me.
Lannister’s
men
drew
back.
I
never
said
a
word.
I
looked
at
him
seated
there
on
the
throne,
and
I
waited.
At
last
Jaime
laughed
and
got
up.
He
took
off
his
helm,
and
he
said
to
me,
‘Have
no
fear,
Stark.
I
was
only
keeping
it
warm
for
our
friend
Robert.
It’s
not
a
very
comfortable
seat,
I’m
afraid.’”

The
king
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
His
laughter
startled
a
flight
of
crows
from
the
tall
brown
grass.
They
took
to
the
air
in
a
wild
beating
of
wings.
“You
think
I
should
mistrust
Lannister
because
he
sat
on
my
throne
for
a
few
moments?”
He
shook
with
laughter
again.
“Jaime
was
all
of
seventeen,
Ned.
Scarce
more
than
a
boy.”

“Boy
or
man,
he
had
no
right
to
that
throne.”

“Perhaps
he
was
tired,”
Robert
suggested.
“Killing
kings
is
weary
work.
Gods
know,
there’s
no
place
else
to
rest
your
ass
in
that
damnable
room.
And
he
spoke
truly,
it
is
a
monstrous
uncomfortable
chair.
In
more
ways
than
one.”
The
king
shook
his
head.
“Well,
now
I
know
Jaime’s
dark
sin,
and
the
matter
can
be
forgotten.
I
am
heartily
sick
of
secrets
and
squabbles
and
matters
of
state,
Ned.
It’s
all
as
tedious
as
counting
coppers.
Come,
let’s
ride,
you
used
to
know
how.
I
want
to
feel
the
wind
in
my
hair
again.”
He
kicked
his
horse
back
into
motion
and
galloped
up
over
the
barrow,
raining
earth
down
behind
him.

For
a
moment
Ned
did
not
follow.
He
had
run
out
of
words,
and
he
was
filled
with
a
vast
sense
of
helplessness.
Not
for
the
first
time,
he
wondered
what
he
was
doing
here
and
why
he
had
come.
He
was
no
Jon
Arryn,
to
curb
the
wildness
of
his
king
and
teach
him
wisdom.
Robert
would
do
what
he
pleased,
as
he
always
had,
and
nothing
Ned
could
say
or
do
would
change
that.
He
belonged
in
Winterfell.
He
belonged
with
Catelyn
in
her
grief,
and
with
Bran.

A
man
could
not
always
be
where
he
belonged,
though.
Resigned,
Eddard
Stark
put
his
boots
into
his
horse
and
set
off
after
the
king.





TYRION

The
north
went
on
forever.

Tyrion
Lannister
knew
the
maps
as
well
as
anyone,
but
a
fortnight
on
the
wild
track
that
passed
for
the
kingsroad
up
here
had
brought
home
the
lesson
that
the
map
was
one
thing
and
the
land
quite
another.

They
had
left
Winterfell
on
the
same
day
as
the
king,
amidst
all
the
commotion
of
the
royal
departure,
riding
out
to
the
sound
of
men
shouting
and
horses
snorting,
to
the
rattle
of
wagons
and
the
groaning
of
the
queen’s
huge
wheelhouse,
as
a
light
snow
flurried
about
them.
The
kingsroad
was
just
beyond
the
sprawl
of
castle
and
town.
There
the
banners
and
the
wagons
and
the
columns
of
knights
and
freeriders
turned
south,
taking
the
tumult
with
them,
while
Tyrion
turned
north
with
Benjen
Stark
and
his
nephew.

It
had
grown
colder
after
that,
and
far
more
quiet.

West
of
the
road
were
flint
hills,
grey
and
rugged,
with
tall
watchtowers
on
their
stony
summits.
To
the
east
the
land
was
lower,
the
ground
flattening
to
a
rolling
plain
that
stretched
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
Stone
bridges
spanned
swift,
narrow
rivers,
while
small
farms
spread
in
rings
around
holdfasts
walled
in
wood
and
stone.
The
road
was
well
trafficked,
and
at
night
for
their
comfort
there
were
rude
inns
to
be
found.

Three
days
ride
from
Winterfell,
however,
the
farmland
gave
way
to
dense
wood,
and
the
kingsroad
grew
lonely.
The
flint
hills
rose
higher
and
wilder
with
each
passing
mile,
until
by
the
fifth
day
they
had
turned
into
mountains,
cold
blue-grey
giants
with
jagged
promontories
and
snow
on
their
shoulders.
When
the
wind
blew
from
the
north,
long
plumes
of
ice
crystals
flew
from
the
high
peaks
like
banners.

With
the
mountains
a
wall
to
the
west,
the
road
veered
north
by
northeast
through
the
wood,
a
forest
of
oak
and
evergreen
and
black
brier
that
seemed
older
and
darker
than
any
Tyrion
had
ever
seen.
“The
wolfswood,”
Benjen
Stark
called
it,
and
indeed
their
nights
came
alive
with
the
howls
of
distant
packs,
and
some
not
so
distant.
Jon
Snow’s
albino
direwolf
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
nightly
howling,
but
never
raised
his
own
voice
in
reply.
There
was
something
very
unsettling
about
that
animal,
Tyrion
thought.

There
were
eight
in
the
party
by
then,
not
counting
the
wolf.
Tyrion
traveled
with
two
of
his
own
men,
as
befit
a
Lannister.
Benjen
Stark
had
only
his
bastard
nephew
and
some
fresh
mounts
for
the
Night’s
Watch,
but
at
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood
they
stayed
a
night
behind
the
wooden
walls
of
a
forest
holdfast,
and
there
joined
up
with
another
of
the
black
brothers,
one
Yoren.
Yoren
was
stooped
and
sinister,
his
features
hidden
behind
a
beard
as
black
as
his
clothing,
but
he
seemed
as
tough
as
an
old
root
and
as
hard
as
stone.
With
him
were
a
pair
of
ragged
peasant
boys
from
the
Fingers.
“Rapers,”
Yoren
said
with
a
cold
look
at
his
charges.
Tyrion
understood.
Life
on
the
Wall
was
said
to
be
hard,
but
no
doubt
it
was
preferable
to
castration.

Five
men,
three
boys,
a
direwolf,
twenty
horses,
and
a
cage
of
ravens
given
over
to
Benjen
Stark
by
Maester
Luwin.
No
doubt
they
made
a
curious
fellowship
for
the
kingsroad,
or
any
road.

Tyrion
noticed
Jon
Snow
watching
Yoren
and
his
sullen
companions,
with
an
odd
cast
to
his
face
that
looked
uncomfortably
like
dismay.
Yoren
had
a
twisted
shoulder
and
a
sour
smell,
his
hair
and
beard
were
matted
and
greasy
and
full
of
lice,
his
clothing
old,
patched,
and
seldom
washed.
His
two
young
recruits
smelled
even
worse,
and
seemed
as
stupid
as
they
were
cruel.

No
doubt
the
boy
had
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
Night’s
Watch
was
made
up
of
men
like
his
uncle.
If
so,
Yoren
and
his
companions
were
a
rude
awakening.
Tyrion
felt
sorry
for
the
boy.
He
had
chosen
a
hard
life…
or
perhaps
he
should
say
that
a
hard
life
had
been
chosen
for
him.

He
had
rather
less
sympathy
for
the
uncle.
Benjen
Stark
seemed
to
share
his
brother’s
distaste
for
Lannisters,
and
he
had
not
been
pleased
when
Tyrion
had
told
him
of
his
intentions.
“I
warn
you,
Lannister,
you’ll
find
no
inns
at
the
Wall,”
he
had
said,
looking
down
on
him.

“No
doubt
you’ll
find
some
place
to
put
me,”
Tyrion
had
replied.
“As
you
might
have
noticed,
I’m
small.”

One
did
not
say
no
to
the
queen’s
brother,
of
course,
so
that
had
settled
the
matter,
but
Stark
had
not
been
happy.
“You
will
not
like
the
ride,
I
promise
you
that,”
he’d
said
curtly,
and
since
the
moment
they
set
out,
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
live
up
to
that
promise.

By
the
end
of
the
first
week,
Tyrion’s
thighs
were
raw
from
hard
riding,
his
legs
were
cramping
badly,
and
he
was
chilled
to
the
bone.
He
did
not
complain.
He
was
damned
if
he
would
give
Benjen
Stark
that
satisfaction.

He
took
a
small
revenge
in
the
matter
of
his
riding
fur,
a
tattered
bearskin,
old
and
musty-smelling.
Stark
had
offered
it
to
him
in
an
excess
of
Night’s
Watch
gallantry,
no
doubt
expecting
him
to
graciously
decline.
Tyrion
had
accepted
with
a
smile.
He
had
brought
his
warmest
clothing
with
him
when
they
rode
out
of
Winterfell,
and
soon
discovered
that
it
was
nowhere
near
warm
enough.
It
was
cold
up
here,
and
growing
colder.
The
nights
were
well
below
freezing
now,
and
when
the
wind
blew
it
was
like
a
knife
cutting
right
through
his
warmest
woolens.
By
now
Stark
was
no
doubt
regretting
his
chivalrous
impulse.
Perhaps
he
had
learned
a
lesson.
The
Lannisters
never
declined,
graciously
or
otherwise.
The
Lannisters
took
what
was
offered.

Farms
and
holdfasts
grew
scarcer
and
smaller
as
they
pressed
northward,
ever
deeper
into
the
darkness
of
the
wolfswood,
until
finally
there
were
no
more
roofs
to
shelter
under,
and
they
were
thrown
back
on
their
own
resources.

Tyrion
was
never
much
use
in
making
a
camp
or
breaking
one.
Too
small,
too
hobbled,
too
in-the-way.
So
while
Stark
and
Yoren
and
the
other
men
erected
rude
shelters,
tended
the
horses,
and
built
a
fire,
it
became
his
custom
to
take
his
fur
and
a
wineskin
and
go
off
by
himself
to
read.

On
the
eighteenth
night
of
their
journey,
the
wine
was
a
rare
sweet
amber
from
the
Summer
Isles
that
he
had
brought
all
the
way
north
from
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
book
a
rumination
on
the
history
and
properties
of
dragons.
With
Lord
Eddard
Stark’s
permission,
Tyrion
had
borrowed
a
few
rare
volumes
from
the
Winterfell
library
and
packed
them
for
the
ride
north.

He
found
a
comfortable
spot
just
beyond
the
noise
of
the
camp,
beside
a
swift-running
stream
with
waters
clear
and
cold
as
ice.
A
grotesquely
ancient
oak
provided
shelter
from
the
biting
wind.
Tyrion
curled
up
in
his
fur
with
his
back
against
the
trunk,
took
a
sip
of
the
wine,
and
began
to
read
about
the
properties
of
dragonbone.
Dragonbone
is
black
because
of
its
high
iron
content,
the
book
told
him.
It
is
strong
as
steel,
yet
lighter
and
far
more
flexible,
and
of
course
utterly
impervious
to
fire.
Dragonbone
bows
are
greatly
prized
by
the
Dothraki,
and
small
wonder.
An
archer
so
armed
can
outrange
any
wooden
bow.

Tyrion
had
a
morbid
fascination
with
dragons.
When
he
had
first
come
to
King’s
Landing
for
his
sister’s
wedding
to
Robert
Baratheon,
he
had
made
it
a
point
to
seek
out
the
dragon
skulls
that
had
hung
on
the
walls
of
Targaryen’s
throne
room.
King
Robert
had
replaced
them
with
banners
and
tapestries,
but
Tyrion
had
persisted
until
he
found
the
skulls
in
the
dank
cellar
where
they
had
been
stored.

He
had
expected
to
find
them
impressive,
perhaps
even
frightening.
He
had
not
thought
to
find
them
beautiful.
Yet
they
were.
As
black
as
onyx,
polished
smooth,
so
the
bone
seemed
to
shimmer
in
the
light
of
his
torch.
They
liked
the
fire,
he
sensed.
He’d
thrust
the
torch
into
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
larger
skulls
and
made
the
shadows
leap
and
dance
on
the
wall
behind
him.
The
teeth
were
long,
curving
knives
of
black
diamond.
The
flame
of
the
torch
was
nothing
to
them;
they
had
bathed
in
the
heat
of
far
greater
fires.
When
he
had
moved
away,
Tyrion
could
have
sworn
that
the
beast’s
empty
eye
sockets
had
watched
him
go.

There
were
nineteen
skulls.
The
oldest
was
more
than
three
thousand
years
old;
the
youngest
a
mere
century
and
a
half.
The
most
recent
were
also
the
smallest;
a
matched
pair
no
bigger
than
mastiff’s
skulls,
and
oddly
misshapen,
all
that
remained
of
the
last
two
hatchlings
born
on
Dragonstone.
They
were
the
last
of
the
Targaryen
dragons,
perhaps
the
last
dragons
anywhere,
and
they
had
not
lived
very
long.

From
there
the
skulls
ranged
upward
in
size
to
the
three
great
monsters
of
song
and
story,
the
dragons
that
Aegon
Targaryen
and
his
sisters
had
unleashed
on
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
old.
The
singers
had
given
them
the
names
of
gods:
Balerion,
Meraxes,
Vhaghar.
Tyrion
had
stood
between
their
gaping
jaws,
wordless
and
awed.
You
could
have
ridden
a
horse
down
Vhaghar’s
gullet,
although
you
would
not
have
ridden
it
out
again.
Meraxes
was
even
bigger.
And
the
greatest
of
them,
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread,
could
have
swallowed
an
aurochs
whole,
or
even
one
of
the
hairy
mammoths
said
to
roam
the
cold
wastes
beyond
the
Port
of
Ibben.

Tyrion
stood
in
that
dank
cellar
for
a
long
time,
staring
at
Balerion’s
huge,
empty-eyed
skull
until
his
torch
burned
low,
trying
to
grasp
the
size
of
the
living
animal,
to
imagine
how
it
must
have
looked
when
it
spread
its
great
black
wings
and
swept
across
the
skies,
breathing
fire.

His
own
remote
ancestor,
King
Loren
of
the
Rock,
had
tried
to
stand
against
the
fire
when
he
joined
with
King
Mern
of
the
Reach
to
oppose
the
Targaryen
conquest.
That
was
close
on
three
hundred
years
ago,
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
kingdoms,
and
not
mere
provinces
of
a
greater
realm.
Between
them,
the
Two
Kings
had
six
hundred
banners
flying,
five
thousand
mounted
knights,
and
ten
times
as
many
freeriders
and
men-at-arms.
Aegon
Dragonlord
had
perhaps
a
fifth
that
number,
the
chroniclers
said,
and
most
of
those
were
conscripts
from
the
ranks
of
the
last
king
he
had
slain,
their
loyalties
uncertain.

The
hosts
met
on
the
broad
plains
of
the
Reach,
amidst
golden
fields
of
wheat
ripe
for
harvest.
When
the
Two
Kings
charged,
the
Targaryen
army
shivered
and
shattered
and
began
to
run.
For
a
few
moments,
the
chroniclers
wrote,
the
conquest
was
at
an
end…
but
only
for
those
few
moments,
before
Aegon
Targaryen
and
his
sisters
joined
the
battle.

It
was
the
only
time
that
Vhaghar,
Meraxes,
and
Balerion
were
all
unleashed
at
once.
The
singers
called
it
the
Field
of
Fire.

Near
four
thousand
men
had
burned
that
day,
among
them
King
Mern
of
the
Reach.
King
Loren
had
escaped,
and
lived
long
enough
to
surrender,
pledge
his
fealty
to
the
Targaryens,
and
beget
a
son,
for
which
Tyrion
was
duly
grateful.

“Why
do
you
read
so
much?”

Tyrion
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
voice.
Jon
Snow
was
standing
a
few
feet
away,
regarding
him
curiously.
He
closed
the
book
on
a
finger
and
said,
“Look
at
me
and
tell
me
what
you
see.”

The
boy
looked
at
him
suspiciously.
“Is
this
some
kind
of
trick?
I
see
you.
Tyrion
Lannister.”

Tyrion
sighed.
“You
are
remarkably
polite
for
a
bastard,
Snow.
What
you
see
is
a
dwarf.
You
are
what,
twelve?”

“Fourteen,”
the
boy
said.

“Fourteen,
and
you’re
taller
than
I
will
ever
be.
My
legs
are
short
and
twisted,
and
I
walk
with
difficulty.
I
require
a
special
saddle
to
keep
from
falling
off
my
horse.
A
saddle
of
my
own
design,
you
may
be
interested
to
know.
It
was
either
that
or
ride
a
pony.
My
arms
are
strong
enough,
but
again,
too
short.
I
will
never
make
a
swordsman.
Had
I
been
born
a
peasant,
they
might
have
left
me
out
to
die,
or
sold
me
to
some
slaver’s
grotesquerie.
Alas,
I
was
born
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
grotesqueries
are
all
the
poorer.
Things
are
expected
of
me.
My
father
was
the
Hand
of
the
King
for
twenty
years.
My
brother
later
killed
that
very
same
king,
as
it
turns
out,
but
life
is
full
of
these
little
ironies.
My
sister
married
the
new
king
and
my
repulsive
nephew
will
be
king
after
him.
I
must
do
my
part
for
the
honor
of
my
House,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
Yet
how?
Well,
my
legs
may
be
too
small
for
my
body,
but
my
head
is
too
large,
although
I
prefer
to
think
it
is
just
large
enough
for
my
mind.
I
have
a
realistic
grasp
of
my
own
strengths
and
weaknesses.
My
mind
is
my
weapon.
My
brother
has
his
sword,
King
Robert
has
his
warhammer,
and
I
have
my
mind…
and
a
mind
needs
books
as
a
sword
needs
a
whetstone,
if
it
is
to
keep
its
edge.”
Tyrion
tapped
the
leather
cover
of
the
book.
“That’s
why
I
read
so
much,
Jon
Snow.”

The
boy
absorbed
that
all
in
silence.
He
had
the
Stark
face
if
not
the
name:
long,
solemn,
guarded,
a
face
that
gave
nothing
away.
Whoever
his
mother
had
been,
she
had
left
little
of
herself
in
her
son.
“What
are
you
reading
about?”
he
asked.

“Dragons,”
Tyrion
told
him.

“What
good
is
that?
There
are
no
more
dragons,”
the
boy
said
with
the
easy
certainty
of
youth.

“So
they
say,”
Tyrion
replied.
“Sad,
isn’t
it?
When
I
was
your
age,
used
to
dream
of
having
a
dragon
of
my
own.”

“You
did?”
the
boy
said
suspiciously.
Perhaps
he
thought
Tyrion
was
making
fun
of
him.

“Oh,
yes.
Even
a
stunted,
twisted,
ugly
little
boy
can
look
down
over
the
world
when
he’s
seated
on
a
dragon’s
back.”
Tyrion
pushed
the
bearskin
aside
and
climbed
to
his
feet.
“I
used
to
start
fires
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock
and
stare
at
the
flames
for
hours,
pretending
they
were
dragonfire.
Sometimes
I’d
imagine
my
father
burning.
At
other
times,
my
sister.”
Jon
Snow
was
staring
at
him,
a
look
equal
parts
horror
and
fascination.
Tyrion
guffawed.
“Don’t
look
at
me
that
way,
bastard.
I
know
your
secret.
You’ve
dreamt
the
same
kind
of
dreams.”

“No,”
Jon
Snow
said,
horrified.
“I
wouldn’t…”

“No?
Never?”
Tyrion
raised
an
eyebrow.
“Well,
no
doubt
the
Starks
have
been
terribly
good
to
you.
I’m
certain
Lady
Stark
treats
you
as
if
you
were
one
of
her
own.
And
your
brother
Robb,
he’s
always
been
kind,
and
why
not?
He
gets
Winterfell
and
you
get
the
Wall.
And
your
father…
he
must
have
good
reasons
for
packing
you
off
to
the
Night’s
Watch…”

“Stop
it,”
Jon
Snow
said,
his
face
dark
with
anger.
“The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
noble
calling!”

Tyrion
laughed.
“You’re
too
smart
to
believe
that.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
midden
heap
for
all
the
misfits
of
the
realm.
I’ve
seen
you
looking
at
Yoren
and
his
boys.
Those
are
your
new
brothers,
Jon
Snow,
how
do
you
like
them?
Sullen
peasants,
debtors,
poachers,
rapers,
thieves,
and
bastards
like
you
all
wind
up
on
the
Wall,
watching
for
grumkins
and
snarks
and
all
the
other
monsters
your
wet
nurse
warned
you
about.
The
good
part
is
there
are
no
grumkins
or
snarks,
so
it’s
scarcely
dangerous
work.
The
bad
part
is
you
freeze
your
balls
off,
but
since
you’re
not
allowed
to
breed
anyway,
I
don’t
suppose
that
matters.”

“Stop
it!”
the
boy
screamed.
He
took
a
step
forward,
his
hands
coiling
into
fists,
close
to
tears.

Suddenly,
absurdly,
Tyrion
felt
guilty.
He
took
a
step
forward,
intending
to
give
the
boy
a
reassuring
pat
on
the
shoulder
or
mutter
some
word
of
apology.

He
never
saw
the
wolf,
where
it
was
or
how
it
came
at
him.
One
moment
he
was
walking
toward
Snow
and
the
next
he
was
flat
on
his
back
on
the
hard
rocky
ground,
the
book
spinning
away
from
him
as
he
fell,
the
breath
going
out
of
him
at
the
sudden
impact,
his
mouth
full
of
dirt
and
blood
and
rotting
leaves.
As
he
tried
to
get
up,
his
back
spasmed
painfully.
He
must
have
wrenched
it
in
the
fall.
He
ground
his
teeth
in
frustration,
grabbed
a
root,
and
pulled
himself
back
to
a
sitting
position.
“Help
me,”
he
said
to
the
boy,
reaching
up
a
hand.

And
suddenly
the
wolf
was
between
them.
He
did
not
growl.
The
damned
thing
never
made
a
sound.
He
only
looked
at
him
with
those
bright
red
eyes,
and
showed
him
his
teeth,
and
that
was
more
than
enough.
Tyrion
sagged
back
to
the
ground
with
a
grunt.
“Don’t
help
me,
then.
I’ll
sit
right
here
until
you
leave.”

Jon
Snow
stroked
Ghost’s
thick
white
fur,
smiling
now.
“Ask
me
nicely.”

Tyrion
Lannister
felt
the
anger
coiling
inside
him,
and
crushed
it
out
with
a
will.
It
was
not
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
humiliated,
and
it
would
not
be
the
last.
Perhaps
he
even
deserved
this.
“I
should
be
very
grateful
for
your
kind
assistance,
Jon,”
he
said
mildly.

“Down,
Ghost,”
the
boy
said.
The
direwolf
sat
on
his
haunches.
Those
red
eyes
never
left
Tyrion.
Jon
came
around
behind
him,
slid
his
hands
under
his
arms,
and
lifted
him
easily
to
his
feet.
Then
he
picked
up
the
book
and
handed
it
back.

“Why
did
he
attack
me?”
Tyrion
asked
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
direwolf.
He
wiped
blood
and
dirt
from
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.

“Maybe
he
thought
you
were
a
grumkin.”

Tyrion
glanced
at
him
sharply.
Then
he
laughed,
a
raw
snort
of
amusement
that
came
bursting
out
through
his
nose
entirely
without
his
permission.
“Oh,
gods,”
he
said,
choking
on
his
laughter
and
shaking
his
head,
“I
suppose
I
do
rather
look
like
a
grumkin.
What
does
he
do
to
snarks?”

“You
don’t
want
to
know.”
Jon
picked
up
the
wineskin
and
handed
it
to
Tyrion.

Tyrion
pulled
out
the
stopper,
tilted
his
head,
and
squeezed
a
long
stream
into
his
mouth.
The
wine
was
cool
fire
as
it
trickled
down
his
throat
and
warmed
his
belly.
He
held
out
the
skin
to
Jon
Snow.
“Want
some?”

The
boy
took
the
skin
and
tried
a
cautious
swallow.
“It’s
true,
isn’t
it?”
he
said
when
he
was
done.
“What
you
said
about
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Tyrion
nodded.

Jon
Snow
set
his
mouth
in
a
grim
line.
“If
that’s
what
it
is,
that’s
what
it
is.”

Tyrion
grinned
at
him.
“That’s
good,
bastard.
Most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it.”

“Most
men,”
the
boy
said.
“But
not
you.”

“No,”
Tyrion
admitted,
“not
me.
I
seldom
even
dream
of
dragons
anymore.
There
are
no
dragons.”
He
scooped
up
the
fallen
bearskin.
“Come,
we
had
better
return
to
camp
before
your
uncle
calls
the
banners.”

The
walk
was
short,
but
the
ground
was
rough
underfoot
and
his
legs
were
cramping
badly
by
the
time
they
got
back.
Jon
Snow
offered
a
hand
to
help
him
over
a
thick
tangle
of
roots,
but
Tyrion
shook
him
off.
He
would
make
his
own
way,
as
he
had
all
his
life.
Still,
the
camp
was
a
welcome
sight.
The
shelters
had
been
thrown
up
against
the
tumbledown
wall
of
a
long-abandoned
holdfast,
a
shield
against
the
wind.
The
horses
had
been
fed
and
a
fire
had
been
laid.
Yoren
sat
on
a
stone,
skinning
a
squirrel.
The
savory
smell
of
stew
filled
Tyrion’s
nostrils.
He
dragged
himself
over
to
where
his
man
Morrec
was
tending
the
stewpot.
Wordlessly,
Morrec
handed
him
the
ladle.
Tyrion
tasted
and
handed
it
back.
“More
pepper,”
he
said.

Benjen
Stark
emerged
from
the
shelter
he
shared
with
his
nephew.
“There
you
are.
Jon,
damn
it,
don’t
go
off
like
that
by
yourself.
I
thought
the
Others
had
gotten
you.”

“It
was
the
grumkins,”
Tyrion
told
him,
laughing.
Jon
Snow
smiled.
Stark
shot
a
baffled
look
at
Yoren.
The
old
man
grunted,
shrugged,
and
went
back
to
his
bloody
work.

The
squirrel
gave
some
body
to
the
stew,
and
they
ate
it
with
black
bread
and
hard
cheese
that
night
around
their
fire.
Tyrion
shared
around
his
skin
of
wine
until
even
Yoren
grew
mellow.
One
by
one
the
company
drifted
off
to
their
shelters
and
to
sleep,
all
but
Jon
Snow,
who
had
drawn
the
night’s
first
watch.

Tyrion
was
the
last
to
retire,
as
always.
As
he
stepped
into
the
shelter
his
men
had
built
for
him,
he
paused
and
looked
back
at
Jon
Snow.
The
boy
stood
near
the
fire,
his
face
still
and
hard,
looking
deep
into
the
flames.

Tyrion
Lannister
smiled
sadly
and
went
to
bed.





CATELYN

Ned
and
the
girls
were
eight
days
gone
when
Maester
Luwin
came
to
her
one
night
in
Bran’s
sickroom,
carrying
a
reading
lamp
and
the
books
of
account.
“It
is
past
time
that
we
reviewed
the
figures,
my
lady,”
he
said.
“You’ll
want
to
know
how
much
this
royal
visit
cost
us.”

Catelyn
looked
at
Bran
in
his
sickbed
and
brushed
his
hair
back
off
his
forehead.
It
had
grown
very
long,
she
realized.
She
would
have
to
cut
it
soon.
“I
have
no
need
to
look
at
figures,
Maester
Luwin,”
she
told
him,
never
taking
her
eyes
from
Bran.
“I
know
what
the
visit
cost
us.
Take
the
books
away.”

“My
lady,
the
king’s
party
had
healthy
appetites.
We
must
replenish
our
stores
before—”

She
cut
him
off.
“I
said,
take
the
books
away.
The
steward
will
attend
to
our
needs.”

“We
have
no
steward,”
Maester
Luwin
reminded
her.
Like
a
little
grey
rat,
she
thought,
he
would
not
let
go.
“Poole
went
south
to
establish
Lord
Eddard’s
household
at
King’s
Landing.”

Catelyn
nodded
absently.
“Oh,
yes.
I
remember.”
Bran
looked
so
pale.
She
wondered
whether
they
might
move
his
bed
under
the
window,
so
he
could
get
the
morning
sun.

Maester
Luwin
set
the
lamp
in
a
niche
by
the
door
and
fiddled
with
its
wick.
“There
are
several
appointments
that
require
your
immediate
attention,
my
lady.
Besides
the
steward,
we
need
a
captain
of
the
guards
to
fill
Jory’s
place,
a
new
master
of
horse—”

Her
eyes
snapped
around
and
found
him.
“A
master
of
horse?”
Her
voice
was
a
whip.

The
maester
was
shaken.
“Yes,
my
lady.
Hullen
rode
south
with
Lord
Eddard,
so—”

“My
son
lies
here
broken
and
dying,
Luwin,
and
you
wish
to
discuss
a
new
master
of
horse?
Do
you
think
I
care
what
happens
in
the
stables?
Do
you
think
it
matters
to
me
one
whit?
I
would
gladly
butcher
every
horse
in
Winterfell
with
my
own
hands
if
it
would
open
Bran’s
eyes,
do
you
understand
that?
Do
you?”

He
bowed
his
head.
“Yes,
my
lady,
but
the
appointments—”

“I’ll
make
the
appointments,”
Robb
said.

Catelyn
had
not
heard
him
enter,
but
there
he
stood
in
the
doorway,
looking
at
her.
She
had
been
shouting,
she
realized
with
a
sudden
flush
of
shame.
What
was
happening
to
her?
She
was
so
tired,
and
her
head
hurt
all
the
time.

Maester
Luwin
looked
from
Catelyn
to
her
son.
“I
have
prepared
a
list
of
those
we
might
wish
to
consider
for
the
vacant
offices,”
he
said,
offering
Robb
a
paper
plucked
from
his
sleeve.

Her
son
glanced
at
the
names.
He
had
come
from
outside,
Catelyn
saw;
his
cheeks
were
red
from
the
cold,
his
hair
shaggy
and
windblown.
“Good
men,”
he
said.
“We’ll
talk
about
them
tomorrow.”
He
handed
back
the
list
of
names.

“Very
good,
my
lord.”
The
paper
vanished
into
his
sleeve.

“Leave
us
now,”
Robb
said.
Maester
Luwin
bowed
and
departed.
Robb
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
turned
to
her.
He
was
wearing
a
sword,
she
saw.
“Mother,
what
are
you
doing?”

Catelyn
had
always
thought
Robb
looked
like
her;
like
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Sansa,
he
had
the
Tully
coloring,
the
auburn
hair,
the
blue
eyes.
Yet
now
for
the
first
time
she
saw
something
of
Eddard
Stark
in
his
face,
something
as
stern
and
hard
as
the
north.
“What
am
I
doing?”
she
echoed,
puzzled.
“How
can
you
ask
that?
What
do
you
imagine
I’m
doing?
I
am
taking
care
of
your
brother.
I
am
taking
care
of
Bran.”

“Is
that
what
you
call
it?
You
haven’t
left
this
room
since
Bran
was
hurt.
You
didn’t
even
come
to
the
gate
when
Father
and
the
girls
went
south.”

“I
said
my
farewells
to
them
here,
and
watched
them
ride
out
from
that
window.”
She
had
begged
Ned
not
to
go,
not
now,
not
after
what
had
happened;
everything
had
changed
now,
couldn’t
he
see
that?
It
was
no
use.
He
had
no
choice,
he
had
told
her,
and
then
he
left,
choosing.
“I
can’t
leave
him,
even
for
a
moment,
not
when
any
moment
could
be
his
last.
I
have
to
be
with
him,
if…
if…”
She
took
her
son’s
limp
hand,
sliding
his
fingers
through
her
own.
He
was
so
frail
and
thin,
with
no
strength
left
in
his
hand,
but
she
could
still
feel
the
warmth
of
life
through
his
skin.

Robb’s
voice
softened.
“He’s
not
going
to
die,
Mother.
Maester
Luwin
says
the
time
of
greatest
danger
has
passed.”

“And
what
if
Maester
Luwin
is
wrong?
What
if
Bran
needs
me
and
I’m
not
here?”

“Rickon
needs
you,”
Robb
said
sharply.
“He’s
only
three,
he
doesn’t
understand
what’s
happening.
He
thinks
everyone
has
deserted
him,
so
he
follows
me
around
all
day,
clutching
my
leg
and
crying.
I
don’t
know
what
to
do
with
him.”
He
paused
a
moment,
chewing
on
his
lower
lip
the
way
he’d
done
when
he
was
little.
“Mother,
I
need
you
too.
I’m
trying
but
I
can’t…
I
can’t
do
it
all
by
myself.”
His
voice
broke
with
sudden
emotion,
and
Catelyn
remembered
that
he
was
only
fourteen.
She
wanted
to
get
up
and
go
to
him,
but
Bran
was
still
holding
her
hand
and
she
could
not
move.

Outside
the
tower,
a
wolf
began
to
howl.
Catelyn
trembled,
just
for
a
second.

“Bran’s.”
Robb
opened
the
window
and
let
the
night
air
into
the
stuffy
tower
room.
The
howling
grew
louder.
It
was
a
cold
and
lonely
sound,
full
of
melancholy
and
despair.

“Don’t,”
she
told
him.
“Bran
needs
to
stay
warm.”

“He
needs
to
hear
them
sing,”
Robb
said.
Somewhere
out
in
Winterfell,
a
second
wolf
began
to
howl
in
chorus
with
the
first.
Then
a
third,
closer.
“Shaggydog
and
Grey
Wind,”
Robb
said
as
their
voices
rose
and
fell
together.
“You
can
tell
them
apart
if
you
listen
close.”

Catelyn
was
shaking.
It
was
the
grief,
the
cold,
the
howling
of
the
direwolves.
Night
after
night,
the
howling
and
the
cold
wind
and
the
grey
empty
castle,
on
and
on
they
went,
never
changing,
and
her
boy
lying
there
broken,
the
sweetest
of
her
children,
the
gentlest,
Bran
who
loved
to
laugh
and
climb
and
dreamt
of
knighthood,
all
gone
now,
she
would
never
hear
him
laugh
again.
Sobbing,
she
pulled
her
hand
free
of
his
and
covered
her
ears
against
those
terrible
howls.
“Make
them
stop!”
she
cried.
“I
can’t
stand
it,
make
them
stop,
make
them
stop,
kill
them
all
if
you
must,
just
make
them
stop!”

She
didn’t
remember
falling
to
the
floor,
but
there
she
was,
and
Robb
was
lifting
her,
holding
her
in
strong
arms.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
Mother.
They
would
never
hurt
him.”
He
helped
her
to
her
narrow
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
sickroom.
“Close
your
eyes,”
he
said
gently.
“Rest.
Maester
Luwin
tells
me
you’ve
hardly
slept
since
Bran’s
fall.”

“I
can’t,”
she
wept.
“Gods
forgive
me,
Robb,
I
can’t,
what
if
he
dies
while
I’m
asleep,
what
if
he
dies,
what
if
he
dies…”
The
wolves
were
still
howling.
She
screamed
and
held
her
ears
again.
“Oh,
gods,
close
the
window!”

“If
you
swear
to
me
you’ll
sleep.”
Robb
went
to
the
window,
but
as
he
reached
for
the
shutters
another
sound
was
added
to
the
mournful
howling
of
the
direwolves.
“Dogs,”
he
said,
listening.
“All
the
dogs
are
barking.
They’ve
never
done
that
before…”
Catelyn
heard
his
breath
catch
in
his
throat.
When
she
looked
up,
his
face
was
pale
in
the
lamplight.
“Fire,”
he
whispered.

Fire,
she
thought,
and
then,
Bran!
“Help
me,”
she
said
urgently,
sitting
up.
“Help
me
with
Bran.”

Robb
did
not
seem
to
hear
her.
“The
library
tower’s
on
fire,”
he
said.

Catelyn
could
see
the
flickering
reddish
light
through
the
open
window
now.
She
sagged
with
relief.
Bran
was
safe.
The
library
was
across
the
bailey,
there
was
no
way
the
fire
would
reach
them
here.
“Thank
the
gods,”
she
whispered.

Robb
looked
at
her
as
if
she’d
gone
mad.
“Mother,
stay
here.
I’ll
come
back
as
soon
as
the
fire’s
out.”
He
ran
then.
She
heard
him
shout
to
the
guards
outside
the
room,
heard
them
descending
together
in
a
wild
rush,
taking
the
stairs
two
and
three
at
a
time.

Outside,
there
were
shouts
of
“Fire!”
in
the
yard,
screams,
running
footsteps,
the
whinny
of
frightened
horses,
and
the
frantic
barking
of
the
castle
dogs.
The
howling
was
gone,
she
realized
as
she
listened
to
the
cacophony.
The
direwolves
had
fallen
silent.

Catelyn
said
a
silent
prayer
of
thanks
to
the
seven
faces
of
god
as
she
went
to
the
window.
Across
the
bailey,
long
tongues
of
flame
shot
from
the
windows
of
the
library.
She
watched
the
smoke
rise
into
the
sky
and
thought
sadly
of
all
the
books
the
Starks
had
gathered
over
the
centuries.
Then
she
closed
the
shutters.

When
she
turned
away
from
the
window,
the
man
was
in
the
room
with
her.

“You
weren’t
s’posed
to
be
here,”
he
muttered
sourly.
“No
one
was
s’posed
to
be
here.”

He
was
a
small,
dirty
man
in
filthy
brown
clothing,
and
he
stank
of
horses.
Catelyn
knew
all
the
men
who
worked
in
their
stables,
and
he
was
none
of
them.
He
was
gaunt,
with
limp
blond
hair
and
pale
eyes
deep-sunk
in
a
bony
face,
and
there
was
a
dagger
in
his
hand.

Catelyn
looked
at
the
knife,
then
at
Bran.
“No,”
she
said.
The
word
stuck
in
her
throat,
the
merest
whisper.

He
must
have
heard
her.
“It’s
a
mercy,”
he
said.
“He’s
dead
already.”

“No,”
Catelyn
said,
louder
now
as
she
found
her
voice
again.
“No,
you
can’t.”
She
spun
back
toward
the
window
to
scream
for
help,
but
the
man
moved
faster
than
she
would
have
believed.
One
hand
clamped
down
over
her
mouth
and
yanked
back
her
head,
the
other
brought
the
dagger
up
to
her
windpipe.
The
stench
of
him
was
overwhelming.

She
reached
up
with
both
hands
and
grabbed
the
blade
with
all
her
strength,
pulling
it
away
from
her
throat.
She
heard
him
cursing
into
her
ear.
Her
fingers
were
slippery
with
blood,
but
she
would
not
let
go
of
the
dagger.
The
hand
over
her
mouth
clenched
more
tightly,
shutting
off
her
air.
Catelyn
twisted
her
head
to
the
side
and
managed
to
get
a
piece
of
his
flesh
between
her
teeth.
She
bit
down
hard
into
his
palm.
The
man
grunted
in
pain.
She
ground
her
teeth
together
and
tore
at
him,
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
let
go.
The
taste
of
his
blood
filled
her
mouth.
She
sucked
in
air
and
screamed,
and
he
grabbed
her
hair
and
pulled
her
away
from
him,
and
she
stumbled
and
went
down,
and
then
he
was
standing
over
her,
breathing
hard,
shaking.
The
dagger
was
still
clutched
tightly
in
his
right
hand,
slick
with
blood.
“You
weren’t
s’posed
to
be
here,”
he
repeated
stupidly.

Catelyn
saw
the
shadow
slip
through
the
open
door
behind
him.
There
was
a
low
rumble,
less
than
a
snarl,
the
merest
whisper
of
a
threat,
but
he
must
have
heard
something,
because
he
started
to
turn
just
as
the
wolf
made
its
leap.
They
went
down
together,
half
sprawled
over
Catelyn
where
she’d
fallen.
The
wolf
had
him
under
the
jaw.
The
man’s
shriek
lasted
less
than
a
second
before
the
beast
wrenched
back
its
head,
taking
out
half
his
throat.

His
blood
felt
like
warm
rain
as
it
sprayed
across
her
face.

The
wolf
was
looking
at
her.
Its
jaws
were
red
and
wet
and
its
eyes
glowed
golden
in
the
dark
room.
It
was
Bran’s
wolf,
she
realized.
Of
course
it
was.
“Thank
you,”
Catelyn
whispered,
her
voice
faint
and
tiny.
She
lifted
her
hand,
trembling.
The
wolf
padded
closer,
sniffed
at
her
fingers,
then
licked
at
the
blood
with
a
wet
rough
tongue.
When
it
had
cleaned
all
the
blood
off
her
hand,
it
turned
away
silently
and
jumped
up
on
Bran’s
bed
and
lay
down
beside
him.
Catelyn
began
to
laugh
hysterically.

That
was
the
way
they
found
them,
when
Robb
and
Maester
Luwin
and
Ser
Rodrik
burst
in
with
half
the
guards
in
Winterfell.
When
the
laughter
finally
died
in
her
throat,
they
wrapped
her
in
warm
blankets
and
led
her
back
to
the
Great
Keep,
to
her
own
chambers.
Old
Nan
undressed
her
and
helped
her
into
a
scalding
hot
bath
and
washed
the
blood
off
her
with
a
soft
cloth.

Afterward
Maester
Luwin
arrived
to
dress
her
wounds.
The
cuts
in
her
fingers
went
deep,
almost
to
the
bone,
and
her
scalp
was
raw
and
bleeding
where
he’d
pulled
out
a
handful
of
hair.
The
maester
told
her
the
pain
was
just
starting
now,
and
gave
her
milk
of
the
poppy
to
help
her
sleep.

Finally
she
closed
her
eyes.

When
she
opened
them
again,
they
told
her
that
she
had
slept
four
days.
Catelyn
nodded
and
sat
up
in
bed.
It
all
seemed
like
a
nightmare
to
her
now,
everything
since
Bran’s
fall,
a
terrible
dream
of
blood
and
grief,
but
she
had
the
pain
in
her
hands
to
remind
her
that
it
was
real.
She
felt
weak
and
light-headed,
yet
strangely
resolute,
as
if
a
great
weight
had
lifted
from
her.

“Bring
me
some
bread
and
honey,”
she
told
her
servants,
“and
take
word
to
Maester
Luwin
that
my
bandages
want
changing.”
They
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
ran
to
do
her
bidding.

Catelyn
remembered
the
way
she
had
been
before,
and
she
was
ashamed.
She
had
let
them
all
down,
her
children,
her
husband,
her
House.
It
would
not
happen
again.
She
would
show
these
northerners
how
strong
a
Tully
of
Riverrun
could
be.

Robb
arrived
before
her
food.
Rodrik
Cassel
came
with
him,
and
her
husband’s
ward
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
lastly
Hallis
Mollen,
a
muscular
guardsman
with
a
square
brown
beard.
He
was
the
new
captain
of
the
guard,
Robb
said.
Her
son
was
dressed
in
boiled
leather
and
ringmail,
she
saw,
and
a
sword
hung
at
his
waist.

“Who
was
he?”
Catelyn
asked
them.

“No
one
knows
his
name,”
Hallis
Mollen
told
her.
“He
was
no
man
of
Winterfell,
m’lady,
but
some
says
they
seen
him
here
and
about
the
castle
these
past
few
weeks.”

“One
of
the
king’s
men,
then,”
she
said,
“or
one
of
the
Lannisters’.
He
could
have
waited
behind
when
the
others
left.”

“Maybe,”
Hal
said.
“With
all
these
strangers
filling
up
Winterfell
of
late,
there’s
no
way
of
saying
who
he
belonged
to.”

“He’d
been
hiding
in
your
stables,”
Greyjoy
said.
“You
could
smell
it
on
him.”

“And
how
could
he
go
unnoticed?”
she
said
sharply.

Hallis
Mollen
looked
abashed.
“Between
the
horses
Lord
Eddard
took
south
and
them
we
sent
north
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
the
stalls
were
half-empty.
It
were
no
great
trick
to
hide
from
the
stableboys.
Could
be
Hodor
saw
him,
the
talk
is
that
boy’s
been
acting
queer,
but
simple
as
he
is…”
Hal
shook
his
head.

“We
found
where
he’d
been
sleeping,”
Robb
put
in.
“He
had
ninety
silver
stags
in
a
leather
bag
buried
beneath
the
straw.”

“It’s
good
to
know
my
son’s
life
was
not
sold
cheaply,”
Catelyn
said
bitterly.

Hallis
Mollen
looked
at
her,
confused.
“Begging
your
grace,
m’lady,
you
saying
he
was
out
to
kill
your
boy?”

Greyjoy
was
doubtful.
“That’s
madness.”

“He
came
for
Bran,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
kept
muttering
how
I
wasn’t
supposed
to
be
there.
He
set
the
library
fire
thinking
I
would
rush
to
put
it
out,
taking
any
guards
with
me.
If
I
hadn’t
been
half-mad
with
grief,
it
would
have
worked.”

“Why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
Bran?”
Robb
said.
“Gods,
he’s
only
a
little
boy,
helpless,
sleeping…”

Catelyn
gave
her
firstborn
a
challenging
look.
“If
you
are
to
rule
in
the
north,
you
must
think
these
things
through,
Robb.
Answer
your
own
question.
Why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
a
sleeping
child?”

Before
he
could
answer,
the
servants
returned
with
a
plate
of
food
fresh
from
the
kitchen.
There
was
much
more
than
she’d
asked
for:
hot
bread,
butter
and
honey
and
blackberry
preserves,
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
a
soft-boiled
egg,
a
wedge
of
cheese,
a
pot
of
mint
tea.
And
with
it
came
Maester
Luwin.

“How
is
my
son,
Maester?”
Catelyn
looked
at
all
the
food
and
found
she
had
no
appetite.

Maester
Luwin
lowered
his
eyes.
“Unchanged,
my
lady.”

It
was
the
reply
she
had
expected,
no
more
and
no
less.
Her
hands
throbbed
with
pain,
as
if
the
blade
were
still
in
her,
cutting
deep.
She
sent
the
servants
away
and
looked
back
to
Robb.
“Do
you
have
the
answer
yet?”

“Someone
is
afraid
Bran
might
wake
up,”
Robb
said,
“afraid
of
what
he
might
say
or
do,
afraid
of
something
he
knows.”

Catelyn
was
proud
of
him.
“Very
good.”
She
turned
to
the
new
captain
of
the
guard.
“We
must
keep
Bran
safe.
If
there
was
one
killer,
there
could
be
others.”

“How
many
guards
do
you
want,
rn’lady?”
Hal
asked.

“So
long
as
Lord
Eddard
is
away,
my
son
is
the
master
of
Winterfell,”
she
told
him.

Robb
stood
a
little
taller.
“Put
one
man
in
the
sickroom,
night
and
day,
one
outside
the
door,
two
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs.
No
one
sees
Bran
without
my
warrant
or
my
mother’s.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord.”

“Do
it
now,”
Catelyn
suggested.

“And
let
his
wolf
stay
in
the
room
with
him,”
Robb
added.

“Yes,”
Catelyn
said.
And
then
again:
“Yes.”

Hallis
Mollen
bowed
and
left
the
room.

“Lady
Stark,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
when
the
guardsman
had
gone,
“did
you
chance
to
notice
the
dagger
the
killer
used?”

“The
circumstances
did
not
allow
me
to
examine
it
closely,
but
I
can
vouch
for
its
edge,”
Catelyn
replied
with
a
dry
smile.
“Why
do
you
ask?”

“We
found
the
knife
still
in
the
villain’s
grasp.
It
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
altogether
too
fine
a
weapon
for
such
a
man,
so
I
looked
at
it
long
and
hard.
The
blade
is
Valyrian
steel,
the
hilt
dragonbone.
A
weapon
like
that
has
no
business
being
in
the
hands
of
such
as
him.
Someone
gave
it
to
him.”

Catelyn
nodded,
thoughtful.
“Robb,
close
the
door.”

He
looked
at
her
strangely,
but
did
as
she
told
him.

“What
I
am
about
to
tell
you
must
not
leave
this
room,”
she
told
them.
“I
want
your
oaths
on
that.
If
even
part
of
what
I
suspect
is
true,
Ned
and
my
girls
have
ridden
into
deadly
danger,
and
a
word
in
the
wrong
ears
could
mean
their
lives.”

“Lord
Eddard
is
a
second
father
to
me,”
said
Theon
Greyjoy.
“I
do
so
swear.”

“You
have
my
oath,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

“And
mine,
my
lady,”
echoed
Ser
Rodrik.

She
looked
at
her
son.
“And
you,
Robb?”

He
nodded
his
consent.

“My
sister
Lysa
believes
the
Lannisters
murdered
her
husband,
Lord
Arryn,
the
Hand
of
the
King,”
Catelyn
told
them.
“It
comes
to
me
that
Jaime
Lannister
did
not
join
the
hunt
the
day
Bran
fell.
He
remained
here
in
the
castle.”
The
room
was
deathly
quiet.
“I
do
not
think
Bran
fell
from
that
tower,”
she
said
into
the
stillness.
“I
think
he
was
thrown.”

The
shock
was
plain
on
their
faces.
“My
lady,
that
is
a
monstrous
suggestion,”
said
Rodrik
Cassel.
“Even
the
Kingslayer
would
flinch
at
the
murder
of
an
innocent
child.”

“Oh,
would
he?”
Theon
Greyjoy
asked.
“I
wonder.”

“There
is
no
limit
to
Lannister
pride
or
Lannister
ambition,”
Catelyn
said.

“The
boy
had
always
been
surehanded
in
the
past,”
Maester
Luwin
said
thoughtfully.
“He
knew
every
stone
in
Winterfell.”

“Gods,”
Robb
swore,
his
young
face
dark
with
anger.
“If
this
is
true,
he
will
pay
for
it.”
He
drew
his
sword
and
waved
it
in
the
air.
“I’ll
kill
him
myself!”

Ser
Rodrik
bristled
at
him.
“Put
that
away!
The
Lannisters
are
a
hundred
leagues
away.
Never
draw
your
sword
unless
you
mean
to
use
it.
How
many
times
must
I
tell
you,
foolish
boy?”

Abashed,
Robb
sheathed
his
sword,
suddenly
a
child
again.
Catelyn
said
to
Ser
Rodrik,
“I
see
my
son
is
wearing
steel
now.”

The
old
master-at-arms
said,
“I
thought
it
was
time.”

Robb
was
looking
at
her
anxiously.
“Past
time,”
she
said.
“Winterfell
may
have
need
of
all
its
swords
soon,
and
they
had
best
not
be
made
of
wood.”

Theon
Greyjoy
put
a
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
blade
and
said,
“My
lady,
if
it
comes
to
that,
my
House
owes
yours
a
great
debt.”

Maester
Luwin
pulled
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
chafed
against
his
neck.
“All
we
have
is
conjecture.
This
is
the
queen’s
beloved
brother
we
mean
to
accuse.
She
will
not
take
it
kindly.
We
must
have
proof,
or
forever
keep
silent.”

“Your
proof
is
in
the
dagger,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“A
fine
blade
like
that
will
not
have
gone
unnoticed.”

There
was
only
one
place
to
find
the
truth
of
it,
Catelyn
realized.
“Someone
must
go
to
King’s
Landing.”

“I’ll
go,”
Robb
said.

“No,”
she
told
him.
“Your
place
is
here.
There
must
always
be
a
Stark
in
Winterfell.”
She
looked
at
Ser
Rodrik
with
his
great
white
whiskers,
at
Maester
Luwin
in
his
grey
robes,
at
young
Greyjoy,
lean
and
dark
and
impetuous.
Who
to
send?
Who
would
be
believed?
Then
she
knew.
Catelyn
struggled
to
push
back
the
blankets,
her
bandaged
fingers
as
stiff
and
unyielding
as
stone.
She
climbed
out
of
bed.
“I
must
go
myself.”

“My
lady,”
said
Maester
Luwin,
“is
that
wise?
Surely
the
Lannisters
would
greet
your
arrival
with
suspicion.”

“What
about
Bran?”
Robb
asked.
The
poor
boy
looked
utterly
confused
now.
“You
can’t
mean
to
leave
him.”

“I
have
done
everything
I
can
for
Bran,”
she
said,
laying
a
wounded
hand
on
his
arm.
“His
life
is
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
and
Maester
Luwin.
As
you
reminded
me
yourself,
Robb,
I
have
other
children
to
think
of
now.”

“You
will
need
a
strong
escort,
my
lady,”
Theon
said.

“I’ll
send
Hal
with
a
squad
of
guardsmen,”
Robb
said.

“No,”
Catelyn
said.
“A
large
party
attracts
unwelcome
attention.
I
would
not
have
the
Lannisters
know
I
am
coming.”

Ser
Rodrik
protested.
“My
lady,
let
me
accompany
you
at
least.
The
kingsroad
can
be
perilous
for
a
woman
alone.”

“I
will
not
be
taking
the
kingsroad,”
Catelyn
replied.
She
thought
for
a
moment,
then
nodded
her
consent.
“Two
riders
can
move
as
fast
as
one,
and
a
good
deal
faster
than
a
long
column
burdened
by
wagons
and
wheelhouses.
I
will
welcome
your
company,
Ser
Rodrik.
We
will
follow
the
White
Knife
down
to
the
sea,
and
hire
a
ship
at
White
Harbor.
Strong
horses
and
brisk
winds
should
bring
us
to
King’s
Landing
well
ahead
of
Ned
and
the
Lannisters.”
And
then,
she
thought,
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see.





SANSA

Eddard
Stark
had
left
before
dawn,
Septa
Mordane
informed
Sansa
as
they
broke
their
fast.
“The
king
sent
for
him.
Another
hunt,
I
do
believe.
There
are
still
wild
aurochs
in
these
lands,
I
am
told.”

“I’ve
never
seen
an
aurochs,”
Sansa
said,
feeding
a
piece
of
bacon
to
Lady
under
the
table.
The
direwolf
took
it
from
her
hand,
as
delicate
as
a
queen.

Septa
Mordane
sniffed
in
disapproval.
“A
noble
lady
does
not
feed
dogs
at
her
table,”
she
said,
breaking
off
another
piece
of
comb
and
letting
the
honey
drip
down
onto
her
bread.

“She’s
not
a
dog,
she’s
a
direwolf,”
Sansa
pointed
out
as
Lady
licked
her
fingers
with
a
rough
tongue.
“Anyway,
Father
said
we
could
keep
them
with
us
if
we
want.”

The
septa
was
not
appeased.
“You’re
a
good
girl,
Sansa,
but
I
do
vow,
when
it
comes
to
that
creature
you’re
as
willful
as
your
sister
Arya.”
She
scowled.
“And
where
is
Arya
this
morning?”

“She
wasn’t
hungry,”
Sansa
said,
knowing
full
well
that
her
sister
had
probably
stolen
down
to
the
kitchen
hours
ago
and
wheedled
a
breakfast
out
of
some
cook’s
boy.

“Do
remind
her
to
dress
nicely
today.
The
grey
velvet,
perhaps.
We
are
all
invited
to
ride
with
the
queen
and
Princess
Myrcella
in
the
royal
wheelhouse,
and
we
must
look
our
best.”

Sansa
already
looked
her
best.
She
had
brushed
out
her
long
auburn
hair
until
it
shone,
and
picked
her
nicest
blue
silks.
She
had
been
looking
forward
to
today
for
more
than
a
week.
It
was
a
great
honor
to
ride
with
the
queen,
and
besides,
Prince
Joffrey
might
be
there.
Her
betrothed.
Just
thinking
it
made
her
feel
a
strange
fluttering
inside,
even
though
they
were
not
to
marry
for
years
and
years.
Sansa
did
not
really
know
Joffrey
yet,
but
she
was
already
in
love
with
him.
He
was
all
she
ever
dreamt
her
prince
should
be,
tall
and
handsome
and
strong,
with
hair
like
gold.
She
treasured
every
chance
to
spend
time
with
him,
few
as
they
were.
The
only
thing
that
scared
her
about
today
was
Arya.
Arya
had
a
way
of
ruining
everything.
You
never
knew
what
she
would
do.
“I’ll
tell
her,”
Sansa
said
uncertainly,
“but
she’ll
dress
the
way
she
always
does.”
She
hoped
it
wouldn’t
be
too
embarrassing.
“May
I
be
excused?”

“You
may.”
Septa
Mordane
helped
herself
to
more
bread
and
honey,
and
Sansa
slid
from
the
bench.
Lady
followed
at
her
heels
as
she
ran
from
the
inn’s
common
room.

Outside,
she
stood
for
a
moment
amidst
the
shouts
and
curses
and
the
creak
of
wooden
wheels
as
the
men
broke
down
the
tents
and
pavilions
and
loaded
the
wagons
for
another
day’s
march.
The
inn
was
a
sprawling
three-story
structure
of
pale
stone,
the
biggest
that
Sansa
had
ever
seen,
but
even
so,
it
had
accommodations
for
less
than
a
third
of
the
king’s
party,
which
had
swollen
to
more
than
four
hundred
with
the
addition
of
her
father’s
household
and
the
freeriders
who
had
joined
them
on
the
road.

She
found
Arya
on
the
banks
of
the
Trident,
trying
to
hold
Nymeria
still
while
she
brushed
dried
mud
from
her
fur.
The
direwolf
was
not
enjoying
the
process.
Arya
was
wearing
the
same
riding
leathers
she
had
worn
yesterday
and
the
day
before.

“You
better
put
on
something
pretty,”
Sansa
told
her.
“Septa
Mordane
said
so.
We’re
traveling
in
the
queen’s
wheelhouse
with
Princess
Myrcella
today.”

“I’m
not,”
Arya
said,
trying
to
brush
a
tangle
out
of
Nymeria’s
matted
grey
fur.
“Mycah
and
I
are
going
to
ride
upstream
and
look
for
rubies
at
the
ford.”

“Rubies,”
Sansa
said,
lost.
“What
rubies?”

Arya
gave
her
a
look
like
she
was
so
stupid.
“Rhaegar’s
rubies.
This
is
where
King
Robert
killed
him
and
won
the
crown.”

Sansa
regarded
her
scrawny
little
sister
in
disbelief.
“You
can’t
look
for
rubies,
the
princess
is
expecting
us.
The
queen
invited
us
both.”

“I
don’t
care,”
Arya
said.
“The
wheelhouse
doesn’t
even
have
windows,
you
can’t
see
a
thing.”

“What
could
you
want
to
see?”
Sansa
said,
annoyed.
She
had
been
thrilled
by
the
invitation,
and
her
stupid
sister
was
going
to
ruin
everything,
just
as
she’d
feared.
“It’s
all
just
fields
and
farms
and
holdfasts.”

“It
is
not,”
Arya
said
stubbornly.
“If
you
came
with
us
sometimes,
you’d
see.”

“I
hate
riding,”
Sansa
said
fervently.
“All
it
does
is
get
you
soiled
and
dusty
and
sore.”

Arya
shrugged.
“Hold
still,”
she
snapped
at
Nymeria,
“I’m
not
hurting
you.”
Then
to
Sansa
she
said,
“When
we
were
crossing
the
Neck,
I
counted
thirty-six
flowers
I
never
saw
before,
and
Mycah
showed
me
a
lizard-lion.”

Sansa
shuddered.
They
had
been
twelve
days
crossing
the
Neck,
rumbling
down
a
crooked
causeway
through
an
endless
black
bog,
and
she
had
hated
every
moment
of
it.
The
air
had
been
damp
and
clammy,
the
causeway
so
narrow
they
could
not
even
make
proper
camp
at
night,
they
had
to
stop
right
on
the
kingsroad.
Dense
thickets
of
half-drowned
trees
pressed
close
around
them,
branches
dripping
with
curtains
of
pale
fungus.
Huge
flowers
bloomed
in
the
mud
and
floated
on
pools
of
stagnant
water,
but
if
you
were
stupid
enough
to
leave
the
causeway
to
pluck
them,
there
were
quicksands
waiting
to
suck
you
down,
and
snakes
watching
from
the
trees,
and
lizard-lions
floating
half-submerged
in
the
water,
like
black
logs
with
eyes
and
teeth.

None
of
which
stopped
Arya,
of
course.
One
day
she
came
back
grinning
her
horsey
grin,
her
hair
all
tangled
and
her
clothes
covered
in
mud,
clutching
a
raggedy
bunch
of
purple
and
green
flowers
for
Father.
Sansa
kept
hoping
he
would
tell
Arya
to
behave
herself
and
act
like
the
highborn
lady
she
was
supposed
to
be,
but
he
never
did,
he
only
hugged
her
and
thanked
her
for
the
flowers.
That
just
made
her
worse.

Then
it
turned
out
the
purple
flowers
were
called
poison
kisses,
and
Arya
got
a
rash
on
her
arms.
Sansa
would
have
thought
that
might
have
taught
her
a
lesson,
but
Arya
laughed
about
it,
and
the
next
day
she
rubbed
mud
all
over
her
arms
like
some
ignorant
bog
woman
just
because
her
friend
Mycah
told
her
it
would
stop
the
itching.
She
had
bruises
on
her
arms
and
shoulders
too,
dark
purple
welts
and
faded
green-and-yellow
splotches,
Sansa
had
seen
them
when
her
sister
undressed
for
sleep.
How
she
had
gotten
those
only
the
seven
gods
knew.

Arya
was
still
going
on,
brushing
out
Nymeria’s
tangles
and
chattering
about
things
she’d
seen
on
the
trek
south.
“Last
week
we
found
this
haunted
watchtower,
and
the
day
before
we
chased
a
herd
of
wild
horses.
You
should
have
seen
them
run
when
they
caught
a
scent
of
Nymeria.”
The
wolf
wriggled
in
her
grasp
and
Arya
scolded
her.
“Stop
that,
I
have
to
do
the
other
side,
you’re
all
muddy.”

“You’re
not
supposed
to
leave
the
column,”
Sansa
reminded
her.
“Father
said
so.”

Arya
shrugged.
“I
didn’t
go
far.
Anyway,
Nymeria
was
with
me
the
whole
time.
I
don’t
always
go
off,
either.
Sometimes
it’s
fun
just
to
ride
along
with
the
wagons
and
talk
to
people.”

Sansa
knew
all
about
the
sorts
of
people
Arya
liked
to
talk
to:
squires
and
grooms
and
serving
girls,
old
men
and
naked
children,
rough-spoken
freeriders
of
uncertain
birth.
Arya
would
make
friends
with
anybody.
This
Mycah
was
the
worst;
a
butcher’s
boy,
thirteen
and
wild,
he
slept
in
the
meat
wagon
and
smelled
of
the
slaughtering
block.
Just
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
to
make
Sansa
feel
sick,
but
Arya
seemed
to
prefer
his
company
to
hers.

Sansa
was
running
out
of
patience
now.
“You
have
to
come
with
me,”
she
told
her
sister
firmly.
“You
can’t
refuse
the
queen.
Septa
Mordane
will
expect
you.”

Arya
ignored
her.
She
gave
a
hard
yank
with
the
brush.
Nymeria
growled
and
spun
away,
affronted.
“Come
back
here!”

“There’s
going
to
be
lemon
cakes
and
tea,”
Sansa
went
on,
all
adult
and
reasonable.
Lady
brushed
against
her
leg.
Sansa
scratched
her
ears
the
way
she
liked,
and
Lady
sat
beside
her
on
her
haunches,
watching
Arya
chase
Nymeria.
“Why
would
you
want
to
ride
a
smelly
old
horse
and
get
all
sore
and
sweaty
when
you
could
recline
on
feather
pillows
and
eat
cakes
with
the
queen?”

“I
don’t
like
the
queen,”
Arya
said
casually.
Sansa
sucked
in
her
breath,
shocked
that
even
Arya
would
say
such
a
thing,
but
her
sister
prattled
on,
heedless.
“She
won’t
even
let
me
bring
Nymeria.”
She
thrust
the
brush
under
her
belt
and
stalked
her
wolf.
Nymeria
watched
her
approach
warily.

“A
royal
wheelhouse
is
no
place
for
a
wolf,”
Sansa
said.
“And
Princess
Myrcella
is
afraid
of
them,
you
know
that.”

“Myrcella
is
a
little
baby.”
Arya
grabbed
Nymeria
around
her
neck,
but
the
moment
she
pulled
out
the
brush
again
the
direwolf
wriggled
free
and
bounded
off.
Frustrated,
Arya
threw
down
the
brush.
“Bad
wolf!”
she
shouted.

Sansa
couldn’t
help
but
smile
a
little.
The
kennelmaster
once
told
her
that
an
animal
takes
after
its
master.
She
gave
Lady
a
quick
little
hug.
Lady
licked
her
cheek.
Sansa
giggled.
Arya
heard
and
whirled
around,
glaring.
“I
don’t
care
what
you
say,
I’m
going
out
riding.”
Her
long
horsey
face
got
the
stubborn
look
that
meant
she
was
going
to
do
something
willful.

“Gods
be
true,
Arya,
sometimes
you
act
like
such
a
child,”
Sansa
said.
“I’ll
go
by
myself
then.
It
will
be
ever
so
much
nicer
that
way.
Lady
and
I
will
eat
all
the
lemon
cakes
and
just
have
the
best
time
without
you.”

She
turned
to
walk
off,
but
Arya
shouted
after
her,
“They
won’t
let
you
bring
Lady
either.”
She
was
gone
before
Sansa
could
think
of
a
reply,
chasing
Nymeria
along
the
river.

Alone
and
humiliated,
Sansa
took
the
long
way
back
to
the
inn,
where
she
knew
Septa
Mordane
would
be
waiting.
Lady
padded
quietly
by
her
side.
She
was
almost
in
tears.
All
she
wanted
was
for
things
to
be
nice
and
pretty,
the
way
they
were
in
the
songs.
Why
couldn’t
Arya
be
sweet
and
delicate
and
kind,
like
Princess
Myrcella?
She
would
have
liked
a
sister
like
that.

Sansa
could
never
understand
how
two
sisters,
born
only
two
years
apart,
could
be
so
different.
It
would
have
been
easier
if
Arya
had
been
a
bastard,
like
their
half
brother
Jon.
She
even
looked
like
Jon,
with
the
long
face
and
brown
hair
of
the
Starks,
and
nothing
of
their
lady
mother
in
her
face
or
her
coloring.
And
Jon’s
mother
had
been
common,
or
so
people
whispered.
Once,
when
she
was
littler,
Sansa
had
even
asked
Mother
if
perhaps
there
hadn’t
been
some
mistake.
Perhaps
the
grumkins
had
stolen
her
real
sister.
But
Mother
had
only
laughed
and
said
no,
Arya
was
her
daughter
and
Sansa’s
trueborn
sister,
blood
of
their
blood.
Sansa
could
not
think
why
Mother
would
want
to
lie
about
it,
so
she
supposed
it
had
to
be
true.

As
she
neared
the
center
of
camp,
her
distress
was
quickly
forgotten.
A
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
queen’s
wheelhouse.
Sansa
heard
excited
voices
buzzing
like
a
hive
of
bees.
The
doors
had
been
thrown
open,
she
saw,
and
the
queen
stood
at
the
top
of
the
wooden
steps,
smiling
down
at
someone.
She
heard
her
saying,
“The
council
does
us
great
honor,
my
good
lords.”

“What’s
happening?”
she
asked
a
squire
she
knew.

“The
council
sent
riders
from
King’s
Landing
to
escort
us
the
rest
of
the
way,”
he
told
her.
“An
honor
guard
for
the
king.”

Anxious
to
see,
Sansa
let
Lady
clear
a
path
through
the
crowd.
People
moved
aside
hastily
for
the
direwolf.
When
she
got
closer,
she
saw
two
knights
kneeling
before
the
queen,
in
armor
so
fine
and
gorgeous
that
it
made
her
blink.

One
knight
wore
an
intricate
suit
of
white
enameled
scales,
brilliant
as
a
field
of
new-fallen
snow,
with
silver
chasings
and
clasps
that
glittered
in
the
sun.
When
he
removed
his
helm,
Sansa
saw
that
he
was
an
old
man
with
hair
as
pale
as
his
armor,
yet
he
seemed
strong
and
graceful
for
all
that.
From
his
shoulders
hung
the
pure
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard.

His
companion
was
a
man
near
twenty
whose
armor
was
steel
plate
of
a
deep
forest-green.
He
was
the
handsomest
man
Sansa
had
ever
set
eyes
upon;
tall
and
powerfully
made,
with
jet-black
hair
that
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
framed
a
clean-shaven
face,
and
laughing
green
eyes
to
match
his
armor.
Cradled
under
one
arm
was
an
antlered
helm,
its
magnificent
rack
shimmering
in
gold.

At
first
Sansa
did
not
notice
the
third
stranger.
He
did
not
kneel
with
the
others.
He
stood
to
one
side,
beside
their
horses,
a
gaunt
grim
man
who
watched
the
proceedings
in
silence.
His
face
was
pockmarked
and
beardless,
with
deepset
eyes
and
hollow
cheeks.
Though
he
was
not
an
old
man,
only
a
few
wisps
of
hair
remained
to
him,
sprouting
above
his
ears,
but
those
he
had
grown
long
as
a
woman’s.
His
armor
was
iron-grey
chainmail
over
layers
of
boiled
leather,
plain
and
unadorned,
and
it
spoke
of
age
and
hard
use.
Above
his
right
shoulder
the
stained
leather
hilt
of
the
blade
strapped
to
his
back
was
visible;
a
two-handed
greatsword,
too
long
to
be
worn
at
his
side.

“The
king
is
gone
hunting,
but
I
know
he
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
when
he
returns,”
the
queen
was
saying
to
the
two
knights
who
knelt
before
her,
but
Sansa
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
the
third
man.
He
seemed
to
feel
the
weight
of
her
gaze.
Slowly
he
turned
his
head.
Lady
growled.
A
terror
as
overwhelming
as
anything
Sansa
Stark
had
ever
felt
filled
her
suddenly.
She
stepped
backward
and
bumped
into
someone.

Strong
hands
grasped
her
by
the
shoulders,
and
for
a
moment
Sansa
thought
it
was
her
father,
but
when
she
turned,
it
was
the
burned
face
of
Sandor
Clegane
looking
down
at
her,
his
mouth
twisted
in
a
terrible
mockery
of
a
smile.
“You
are
shaking,
girl,”
he
said,
his
voice
rasping.
“Do
I
frighten
you
so
much?”

He
did,
and
had
since
she
had
first
laid
eyes
on
the
ruin
that
fire
had
made
of
his
face,
though
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
he
was
not
half
so
terrifying
as
the
other.
Still,
Sansa
wrenched
away
from
him,
and
the
Hound
laughed,
and
Lady
moved
between
them,
rumbling
a
warning.
Sansa
dropped
to
her
knees
to
wrap
her
arms
around
the
wolf.
They
were
all
gathered
around
gaping,
she
could
feel
their
eyes
on
her,
and
here
and
there
she
heard
muttered
comments
and
titters
of
laughter.

“A
wolf,”
a
man
said,
and
someone
else
said,
“Seven
hells,
that’s
a
direwolf,”
and
the
first
man
said,
“What’s
it
doing
in
camp?”
and
the
Hound’s
rasping
voice
replied,
“The
Starks
use
them
for
wet
nurses,”
and
Sansa
realized
that
the
two
stranger
knights
were
looking
down
on
her
and
Lady,
swords
in
their
hands,
and
then
she
was
frightened
again,
and
ashamed.
Tears
filled
her
eyes.

She
heard
the
queen
say,
“Joffrey,
go
to
her.”

And
her
prince
was
there.

“Leave
her
alone,”
Joffrey
said.
He
stood
over
her,
beautiful
in
blue
wool
and
black
leather,
his
golden
curls
shining
in
the
sun
like
a
crown.
He
gave
her
his
hand,
drew
her
to
her
feet.
“What
is
it,
sweet
lady?
Why
are
you
afraid?
No
one
will
hurt
you.
Put
away
your
swords,
all
of
you.
The
wolf
is
her
little
pet,
that’s
all.”
He
looked
at
Sandor
Clegane.
“And
you,
dog,
away
with
you,
you’re
scaring
my
betrothed.”

The
Hound,
ever
faithful,
bowed
and
slid
away
quietly
through
the
press.
Sansa
struggled
to
steady
herself.
She
felt
like
such
a
fool.
She
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
a
noble
lady,
and
someday
she
would
be
a
queen.
“It
was
not
him,
my
sweet
prince,”
she
tried
to
explain.
“It
was
the
other
one.”

The
two
stranger
knights
exchanged
a
look.
“Payne?”
chuckled
the
young
man
in
the
green
armor.

The
older
man
in
white
spoke
to
Sansa
gently.
“Ofttimes
Ser
Ilyn
frightens
me
as
well,
sweet
lady.
He
has
a
fearsome
aspect.”

“As
well
he
should.”
The
queen
had
descended
from
the
wheelhouse.
The
spectators
parted
to
make
way
for
her.
“If
the
wicked
do
not
fear
the
Mng’s
Justice,
you
have
put
the
wrong
man
in
the
office.”

Sansa
finally
found
her
words.
“Then
surely
you
have
chosen
the
right
one,
Your
Grace,”
she
said,
and
a
gale
of
laughter
erupted
all
around
her.

“Well
spoken,
child,”
said
the
old
man
in
white.
“As
befits
the
daughter
of
Eddard
Stark.
I
am
honored
to
know
you,
however
irregular
the
manner
of
our
meeting.
I
am
Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
of
the
Kingsguard.”
He
bowed.

Sansa
knew
the
name,
and
now
the
courtesies
that
Septa
Mordane
had
taught
her
over
the
years
came
back
to
her.
“The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard,”
she
said,
“and
councillor
to
Robert
our
king
and
to
Aerys
Targaryen
before
him.
The
honor
is
mine,
good
knight.
Even
in
the
far
north,
the
singers
praise
the
deeds
of
Barristan
the
Bold.”

The
green
knight
laughed
again.
“Barristan
the
Old,
you
mean.
Don’t
flatter
him
too
sweetly,
child,
he
thinks
overmuch
of
himself
already.”
He
smiled
at
her.
“Now,
wolf
girl,
if
you
can
put
a
name
to
me
as
well,
then
I
must
concede
that
you
are
truly
our
Hand’s
daughter.”

Joffrey
stiffened
beside
her.
“Have
a
care
how
you
address
my
betrothed.”

“I
can
answer,”
Sansa
said
quickly,
to
quell
her
prince’s
anger.
She
smiled
at
the
green
knight.
“Your
helmet
bears
golden
antlers,
my
lord.
The
stag
is
the
sigil
of
the
royal
House.
King
Robert
has
two
brothers.
By
your
extreme
youth,
you
can
only
be
Renly
Baratheon,
Lord
of
Storm’s
End
and
councillor
to
the
king,
and
so
I
name
you.”

Ser
Barristan
chuckled.
“By
his
extreme
youth,
he
can
only
be
a
prancing
jackanapes,
and
so
I
name
him.”

There
was
general
laughter,
led
by
Lord
Renly
himself.
The
tension
of
a
few
moments
ago
was
gone,
and
Sansa
was
beginning
to
feel
comfortable…
until
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
shouldered
two
men
aside,
and
stood
before
her,
unsmiling.
He
did
not
say
a
word.
Lady
bared
her
teeth
and
began
to
growl,
a
low
rumble
full
of
menace,
but
this
time
Sansa
silenced
the
wolf
with
a
gentle
hand
to
the
head.
“I
am
sorry
if
I
offended
you,
Ser
Ilyn,”
she
said.

She
waited
for
an
answer,
but
none
came.
As
the
headsman
looked
at
her,
his
pale
colorless
eyes
seemed
to
strip
the
clothes
away
from
her,
and
then
the
skin,
leaving
her
soul
naked
before
him.
Still
silent,
he
turned
and
walked
away.

Sansa
did
not
understand.
She
looked
at
her
prince.
“Did
I
say
something
wrong,
Your
Grace?
Why
will
he
not
speak
to
me?”

“Ser
Ilyn
has
not
been
feeling
talkative
these
past
fourteen
years,”
Lord
Renly
commented
with
a
sly
smile.

Joffrey
gave
his
uncle
a
look
of
pure
loathing,
then
took
Sansa’s
hands
in
his
own.
“Aerys
Targaryen
had
his
tongue
ripped
out
with
hot
pincers.”

“He
speaks
most
eloquently
with
his
sword,
however,”
the
queen
said,
“and
his
devotion
to
our
realm
is
unquestioned.”
Then
she
smiled
graciously
and
said,
“Sansa,
the
good
councillors
and
I
must
speak
together
until
the
king
returns
with
your
father.
I
fear
we
shall
have
to
postpone
your
day
with
Myrcella.
Please
give
your
sweet
sister
my
apologies.
Joffrey,
perhaps
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
entertain
our
guest
today.”

“It
would
be
my
pleasure,
Mother,”
Joffrey
said
very
formally.
He
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
away
from
the
wheelhouse,
and
Sansa’s
spirits
took
flight.
A
whole
day
with
her
prince!
She
gazed
at
Joffrey
worshipfully.
He
was
so
gallant,
she
thought.
The
way
he
had
rescued
her
from
Ser
Ilyn
and
the
Hound,
why,
it
was
almost
like
the
songs,
like
the
time
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield
saved
the
Princess
Daeryssa
from
the
giants,
or
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
championing
Queen
Naerys’s
honor
against
evil
Ser
Morgil’s
slanders.

The
touch
of
Joffrey’s
hand
on
her
sleeve
made
her
heart
beat
faster.
“What
would
you
like
to
do?”

Be
with
you,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
said,
“Whatever
you’d
like
to
do,
my
prince.”

Jofftey
reflected
a
moment.
“We
could
go
riding.”

“Oh,
I
love
riding,”
Sansa
said.

Joffrey
glanced
back
at
Lady,
who
was
following
at
their
heels.
“Your
wolf
is
liable
to
frighten
the
horses,
and
my
dog
seems
to
frighten
you.
Let
us
leave
them
both
behind
and
set
off
on
our
own,
what
do
you
say?”

Sansa
hesitated.
“If
you
like,”
she
said
uncertainly.
“I
suppose
I
could
tie
Lady
up.”
She
did
not
quite
understand,
though.
“I
didn’t
know
you
had
a
dog…”

Joffrey
laughed.
“He’s
my
mother’s
dog,
in
truth.
She
has
set
him
to
guard
me,
and
so
he
does.”

“You
mean
the
Hound,”
she
said.
She
wanted
to
hit
herself
for
being
so
slow.
Her
prince
would
never
love
her
if
she
seemed
stupid.
“Is
it
safe
to
leave
him
behind?”

Prince
Joffrey
looked
annoyed
that
she
would
even
ask.
“Have
no
fear,
lady.
I
am
almost
a
man
grown,
and
I
don’t
fight
with
wood
like
your
brothers.
All
I
need
is
this.”
He
drew
his
sword
and
showed
it
to
her;
a
longsword
adroitly
shrunken
to
suit
a
boy
of
twelve,
gleaming
blue
steel,
castle-forged
and
double-edged,
with
a
leather
grip
and
a
lion’s-head
pommel
in
gold.
Sansa
exclaimed
over
it
admiringly,
and
Joffrey
looked
pleased.
“I
call
it
Lion’s
Tooth,”
he
said.

And
so
they
left
her
direwolf
and
his
bodyguard
behind
them,
while
they
ranged
east
along
the
north
bank
of
the
Trident
with
no
company
save
Lion’s
Tooth.

It
was
a
glorious
day,
a
magical
day.
The
air
was
warm
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers,
and
the
woods
here
had
a
gentle
beauty
that
Sansa
had
never
seen
in
the
north.
Prince
Joffrey’s
mount
was
a
blood
bay
courser,
swift
as
the
wind,
and
he
rode
it
with
reckless
abandon,
so
fast
that
Sansa
was
hard-pressed
to
keep
up
on
her
mare.
It
was
a
day
for
adventures.
They
explored
the
caves
by
the
riverbank,
and
tracked
a
shadowcat
to
its
lair,
and
when
they
grew
hungry,
Joffrey
found
a
holdfast
by
its
smoke
and
told
them
to
fetch
food
and
wine
for
their
prince
and
his
lady.
They
dined
on
trout
fresh
from
the
river,
and
Sansa
drank
more
wine
than
she
had
ever
drunk
before.
“My
father
only
lets
us
have
one
cup,
and
only
at
feasts,”
she
confessed
to
her
prince.

“My
betrothed
can
drink
as
much
as
she
wants,”
Joffrey
said,
refilling
her
cup.

They
went
more
slowly
after
they
had
eaten.
Joffrey
sang
for
her
as
they
rode,
his
voice
high
and
sweet
and
pure.
Sansa
was
a
little
dizzy
from
the
wine.
“Shouldn’t
we
be
starting
back?”
she
asked.

“Soon,”
Joffrey
said.
“The
battleground
is
right
up
ahead,
where
the
river
bends.
That
was
where
my
father
killed
Rhaegar
Targaryen,
you
know.
He
smashed
in
his
chest,
crunch,
right
through
the
armor.”
Joffrey
swung
an
imaginary
warhammer
to
show
her
how
it
was
done.
“Then
my
uncle
Jaime
killed
old
Aerys,
and
my
father
was
king.
What’s
that
sound?”

Sansa
heard
it
too,
floating
through
the
woods,
a
kind
of
wooden
clattering,
snack
snack
snack.
“I
don’t
know,”
she
said.
It
made
her
nervous,
though.
“Joffrey,
let’s
go
back.”

“I
want
to
see
what
it
is.”
Joffrey
turned
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds,
and
Sansa
had
no
choice
but
to
follow.
The
noises
grew
louder
and
more
distinct,
the
clack
of
wood
on
wood,
and
as
they
grew
closer
they
heard
heavy
breathing
as
well,
and
now
and
then
a
grunt.

“Someone’s
there,”
Sansa
said
anxiously.
She
found
herself
thinking
of
Lady,
wishing
the
direwolf
was
with
her.

“You’re
safe
with
me.”
Joffrey
drew
his
Lion’s
Tooth
from
its
sheath.
The
sound
of
steel
on
leather
made
her
tremble.
“This
way,”
he
said,
riding
through
a
stand
of
trees.

Beyond,
in
a
clearing
overlooking
the
river,
they
came
upon
a
boy
and
a
girl
playing
at
knights.
Their
swords
were
wooden
sticks,
broom
handles
from
the
look
of
them,
and
they
were
rushing
across
the
grass,
swinging
at
each
other
lustily.
The
boy
was
years
older,
a
head
taller,
and
much
stronger,
and
he
was
pressing
the
attack.
The
girl,
a
scrawny
thing
in
soiled
leathers,
was
dodging
and
managing
to
get
her
stick
in
the
way
of
most
of
the
boy’s
blows,
but
not
all.
When
she
tried
to
lunge
at
him,
he
caught
her
stick
with
his
own,
swept
it
aside,
and
slid
his
wood
down
hard
on
her
fingers.
She
cried
out
and
lost
her
weapon.

Prince
Joffrey
laughed.
The
boy
looked
around,
wide-eyed
and
startled,
and
dropped
his
stick
in
the
grass.
The
girl
glared
at
them,
sucking
on
her
knuckles
to
take
the
sting
out,
and
Sansa
was
horrified.
“Arya?”
she
called
out
incredulously.

“Go
away,”
Arya
shouted
back
at
them,
angry
tears
in
her
eyes.
“What
are
you
doing
here?
Leave
us
alone.”

Joffrey
glanced
from
Arya
to
Sansa
and
back
again.
“Your
sister?”
She
nodded,
blushing.
Joffrey
examined
the
boy,
an
ungainly
lad
with
a
coarse,
freckled
face
and
thick
red
hair.
“And
who
are
you,
boy?”
he
asked
in
a
commanding
tone
that
took
no
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
other
was
a
year
his
senior.

“Mycah,”
the
boy
muttered.
He
recognized
the
prince
and
averted
his
eyes.
“M’lord.”

“He’s
the
butcher’s
boy,”
Sansa
said.

“He’s
my
friend,”
Arya
said
sharply.
“You
leave
him
alone.”

“A
butcher’s
boy
who
wants
to
be
a
knight,
is
it?”
Joffrey
swung
down
from
his
mount,
sword
in
hand.
“Pick
up
your
sword,
butcher’s
boy,”
he
said,
his
eyes
bright
with
amusement.
“Let
us
see
how
good
you
are.”

Mycah
stood
there,
frozen
with
fear.

Joffrey
walked
toward
him.
“Go
on,
pick
it
up.
Or
do
you
only
fight
little
girls?”

“She
ast
me
to,
m’lord,”
Mycah
said.
“She
ast
me
to.”

Sansa
had
only
to
glance
at
Arya
and
see
the
flush
on
her
sister’s
face
to
know
the
boy
was
telling
the
truth,
but
Joffrey
was
in
no
mood
to
listen.
The
wine
had
made
him
wild.
“Are
you
going
to
pick
up
your
sword?”

Mycah
shook
his
head.
“It’s
only
a
stick,
m’lord.
It’s
not
no
sword,
it’s
only
a
stick.”

“And
you’re
only
a
butcher’s
boy,
and
no
knight.”
Joffrey
lifted
Lion’s
Tooth
and
laid
its
point
on
Mycah’s
cheek
below
the
eye,
as
the
butcher’s
boy
stood
trembling.
“That
was
my
lady’s
sister
you
were
hitting,
do
you
know
that?”
A
bright
bud
of
blood
blossomed
where
his
sword
pressed
into
Mycah’s
flesh,
and
a
slow
red
line
trickled
down
the
boy’s
cheek.

“Stop
it!”
Arya
screamed.
She
grabbed
up
her
fallen
stick.

Sansa
was
afraid.
“Arya,
you
stay
out
of
this.”

“I
won’t
hurt
him…
much,”
Prince
Joffrey
told
Arya,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
butcher’s
boy.

Arya
went
for
him.

Sansa
slid
off
her
mare,
but
she
was
too
slow.
Arya
swung
with
both
hands.
There
was
a
loud
crack
as
the
wood
split
against
the
back
of
the
prince’s
head,
and
then
everything
happened
at
once
before
Sansa’s
horrified
eyes.
Joffrey
staggered
and
whirled
around,
roaring
curses.
Mycah
ran
for
the
trees
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
take
him.
Arya
swung
at
the
prince
again,
but
this
time
Joffrey
caught
the
blow
on
Lion’s
Tooth
and
sent
her
broken
stick
flying
from
her
hands.
The
back
of
his
head
was
all
bloody
and
his
eyes
were
on
fire.
Sansa
was
shrieking,
“No,
no,
stop
it,
stop
it,
both
of
you,
you’re
spoiling
it,”
but
no
one
was
listening.
Arya
scooped
up
a
rock
and
hurled
it
at
Joffrey’s
head.
She
hit
his
horse
instead,
and
the
blood
bay
reared
and
went
galloping
off
after
Mycah.
“Stop
it,
don’t,
stop
it!”
Sansa
screamed.
Joffrey
slashed
at
Arya
with
his
sword,
screaming
obscenities,
terrible
words,
filthy
words.
Arya
darted
back,
frightened
now,
but
Joffrey
followed,
hounding
her
toward
the
woods,
backing
her
up
against
a
tree.
Sansa
didn’t
know
what
to
do.
She
watched
helplessly,
almost
blind
from
her
tears.

Then
a
grey
blur
flashed
past
her,
and
suddenly
Nymeria
was
there,
leaping,
jaws
closing
around
Joffrey’s
sword
arm.
The
steel
fell
from
his
fingers
as
the
wolf
knocked
him
off
his
feet,
and
they
rolled
in
the
grass,
the
wolf
snarling
and
ripping
at
him,
the
prince
shrieking
in
pain.
“Get
it
off,”
he
screamed.
“Get
it
off!”

Arya’s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip.
“Nymeria!”

The
direwolf
let
go
of
Joffrey
and
moved
to
Arya’s
side.
The
prince
lay
in
the
grass,
whimpering,
cradling
his
mangled
arm.
His
shirt
was
soaked
in
blood.
Arya
said,
“She
didn’t
hurt
you…
much.”
She
picked
up
Lion’s
Tooth
where
it
had
fallen,
and
stood
over
him,
holding
the
sword
with
both
hands.

Jofftey
made
a
scared
whimpery
sound
as
he
looked
up
at
her.
“No,”
he
said,
“don’t
hurt
me.
I’ll
tell
my
mother.”

“You
leave
him
alone!”
Sansa
screamed
at
her
sister.

Arya
whirled
and
heaved
the
sword
into
the
air,
putting
her
whole
body
into
the
throw.
The
blue
steel
flashed
in
the
sun
as
the
sword
spun
out
over
the
river.
It
hit
the
water
and
vanished
with
a
splash.
Joffrey
moaned.
Arya
ran
off
to
her
horse,
Nymeria
loping
at
her
heels.

After
they
had
gone,
Sansa
went
to
Prince
Joffrey.
His
eyes
were
closed
in
pain,
his
breath
ragged.
Sansa
knelt
beside
him.
“Joffrey,”
she
sobbed.
“Oh,
look
what
they
did,
look
what
they
did.
My
poor
prince.
Don’t
be
afraid.
I’ll
ride
to
the
holdfast
and
bring
help
for
you.”
Tenderly
she
reached
out
and
brushed
back
his
soft
blond
hair.

His
eyes
snapped
open
and
looked
at
her,
and
there
was
nothing
but
loathing
there,
nothing
but
the
vilest
contempt.
“Then
go,”
he
spit
at
her.
“And
don’t
touch
me.”





EDDARD

“They’ve
found
her,
my
lord.”

Ned
rose
quickly.
“Our
men
or
Lannister’s?”

“It
was
Jory,”
his
steward
Vayon
Poole
replied.
“She’s
not
been
harmed.”

“Thank
the
gods,”
Ned
said.
His
men
had
been
searching
for
Arya
for
four
days
now,
but
the
queen’s
men
had
been
out
hunting
as
well.
“Where
is
she?
Tell
Jory
to
bring
her
here
at
once.”

“I
am
sorry,
my
lord,”
Poole
told
him.
“The
guards
on
the
gate
were
Lannister
men,
and
they
informed
the
queen
when
Jory
brought
her
in.
She’s
being
taken
directly
before
the
king…”

“Damn
that
woman!”
Ned
said,
striding
to
the
door.
“Find
Sansa
and
bring
her
to
the
audience
chamber.
Her
voice
may
be
needed.”
He
descended
the
tower
steps
in
a
red
rage.
He
had
led
searches
himself
for
the
first
three
days,
and
had
scarcely
slept
an
hour
since
Arya
had
disappeared.
This
morning
he
had
been
so
heartsick
and
weary
he
could
scarcely
stand,
but
now
his
fury
was
on
him,
filling
him
with
strength.

Men
called
out
to
him
as
he
crossed
the
castle
yard,
but
Ned
ignored
them
in
his
haste.
He
would
have
run,
but
he
was
still
the
King’s
Hand,
and
a
Hand
must
keep
his
dignity.
He
was
aware
of
the
eyes
that
followed
him,
of
the
muttered
voices
wondering
what
he
would
do.

The
castle
was
a
modest
holding
a
half
day’s
ride
south
of
the
Trident.
The
royal
party
had
made
themselves
the
uninvited
guests
of
its
lord,
Ser
Raymun
Darry,
while
the
hunt
for
Arya
and
the
butcher’s
boy
was
conducted
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
They
were
not
welcome
visitors.
Ser
Raymun
lived
under
the
king’s
peace,
but
his
family
had
fought
beneath
Rhaegar’s
dragon
banners
at
the
Trident,
and
his
three
older
brothers
had
died
there,
a
truth
neither
Robert
nor
Ser
Raymun
had
forgotten.
With
king’s
men,
Darry
men,
Lannister
men,
and
Stark
men
all
crammed
into
a
castle
far
too
small
for
them,
tensions
burned
hot
and
heavy.

The
king
had
appropriated
Ser
Raymun’s
audience
chamber,
and
that
was
where
Ned
found
them.
The
room
was
crowded
when
he
burst
in.
Too
crowded,
he
thought;
left
alone,
he
and
Robert
might
have
been
able
to
settle
the
matter
amicably.

Robert
was
slumped
in
Darry’s
high
seat
at
the
far
end
of
the
room,
his
face
closed
and
sullen.
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
son
stood
beside
him.
The
queen
had
her
hand
on
Joffrey’s
shoulder.
Thick
silken
bandages
still
covered
the
boy’s
arm.

Arya
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room,
alone
but
for
Jory
Cassel,
every
eye
upon
her.
“Arya,”
Ned
called
loudly.
He
went
to
her,
his
boots
ringing
on
the
stone
floor.
When
she
saw
him,
she
cried
out
and
began
to
sob.

Ned
went
to
one
knee
and
took
her
in
his
arms.
She
was
shaking.
“I’m
sorry,”
she
sobbed,
“I’m
sorry,
I’m
sorry.”

“I
know,”
he
said.
She
felt
so
tiny
in
his
arms,
nothing
but
a
scrawny
little
girl.
It
was
hard
to
see
how
she
had
caused
so
much
trouble.
“Are
you
hurt?”

“No.”
Her
face
was
dirty,
and
her
tears
left
pink
tracks
down
her
cheeks.
“Hungry
some.
I
ate
some
berries,
but
there
was
nothing
else.”

“We’ll
feed
you
soon
enough,”
Ned
promised.
He
rose
to
face
the
king.
“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?”
His
eyes
swept
the
room,
searching
for
friendly
faces.
But
for
his
own
men,
they
were
few
enough.
Ser
Raymun
Darry
guarded
his
look
well.
Lord
Renly
wore
a
half
smile
that
might
mean
anything,
and
old
Ser
Barristan
was
grave;
the
rest
were
Lannister
men,
and
hostile.
Their
only
good
fortune
was
that
both
Jaime
Lannister
and
Sandor
Clegane
were
missing,
leading
searches
north
of
the
Trident.
“Why
was
I
not
told
that
my
daughter
had
been
found?”
Ned
demanded,
his
voice
ringing.
“Why
was
she
not
brought
to
me
at
once?”

He
spoke
to
Robert,
but
it
was
Cersei
Lannister
who
answered.
“How
dare
you
speak
to
your
king
in
that
manner!”

At
that,
the
king
stirred.
“Quiet,
woman,”
he
snapped.
He
straightened
in
his
seat.
“I
am
sorry,
Ned.
I
never
meant
to
frighten
the
girl.
It
seemed
best
to
bring
her
here
and
get
the
business
done
with
quickly.”

“And
what
business
is
that?”
Ned
put
ice
in
his
voice.

The
queen
stepped
forward.
“You
know
full
well,
Stark.
This
girl
of
yours
attacked
my
son.
Her
and
her
butcher’s
boy.
That
animal
of
hers
tried
to
tear
his
arm
off.”

“That’s
not
true,”
Arya
said
loudly.
“She
just
bit
him
a
little.
He
was
hurting
Mycah.”

“Joff
told
us
what
happened,”
the
queen
said.
“You
and
the
butcher
boy
beat
him
with
clubs
while
you
set
your
wolf
on
him.”

“That’s
not
how
it
was,”
Arya
said,
close
to
tears
again.
Ned
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder.

“Yes
it
is!”
Prince
Joffrey
insisted.
“They
all
attacked
me,
and
she
threw
Lion’s
Tooth
in
the
river!”
Ned
noticed
that
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
Arya
as
he
spoke.

“Liar!”
Arya
yelled.

“Shut
up!”
the
prince
yelled
back.

“Enough!”
the
king
roared,
rising
from
his
seat,
his
voice
thick
with
irritation.
Silence
fell.
He
glowered
at
Arya
through
his
thick
beard.
“Now,
child,
you
will
tell
me
what
happened.
Tell
it
all,
and
tell
it
true.
It
is
a
great
crime
to
lie
to
a
king.”
Then
he
looked
over
at
his
son.
“When
she
is
done,
you
will
have
your
turn.
Until
then,
hold
your
tongue.”

As
Arya
began
her
story,
Ned
heard
the
door
open
behind
him.
He
glanced
back
and
saw
Vayon
Poole
enter
with
Sansa.
They
stood
quietly
at
the
back
of
the
hall
as
Arya
spoke.
When
she
got
to
the
part
where
she
threw
Joffrey’s
sword
into
the
middle
of
the
Trident,
Renly
Baratheon
began
to
laugh.
The
king
bristled.
“Ser
Barristan,
escort
my
brother
from
the
hall
before
he
chokes.”

Lord
Renly
stifled
his
laughter.
“My
brother
is
too
kind.
I
can
find
the
door
myself.”
He
bowed
to
Joffrey.
“Perchance
later
you’ll
tell
me
how
a
nine-year-old
girl
the
size
of
a
wet
rat
managed
to
disarm
you
with
a
broom
handle
and
throw
your
sword
in
the
river.”
As
the
door
swung
shut
behind
him,
Ned
heard
him
say,
“Lion’s
Tooth,”
and
guffaw
once
more.

Prince
Joffrey
was
pale
as
he
began
his
very
different
version
of
events.
When
his
son
was
done
talking,
the
king
rose
heavily
from
his
seat,
looking
like
a
man
who
wanted
to
be
anywhere
but
here.
“What
in
all
the
seven
hells
am
I
supposed
to
make
of
this?
He
says
one
thing,
she
says
another.”

“They
were
not
the
only
ones
present,”
Ned
said.
“Sansa,
come
here.”
Ned
had
heard
her
version
of
the
story
the
night
Arya
had
vanished.
He
knew
the
truth.
“Tell
us
what
happened.”

His
eldest
daughter
stepped
forward
hesitantly.
She
was
dressed
in
blue
velvets
trimmed
with
white,
a
silver
chain
around
her
neck.
Her
thick
auburn
hair
had
been
brushed
until
it
shone.
She
blinked
at
her
sister,
then
at
the
young
prince.
“I
don’t
know,”
she
said
tearfully,
looking
as
though
she
wanted
to
bolt.
“I
don’t
remember.
Everything
happened
so
fast,
I
didn’t
see…”

“You
rotten!”
Arya
shrieked.
She
flew
at
her
sister
like
an
arrow,
knocking
Sansa
down
to
the
ground,
pummeling
her.
“Liar,
liar,
liar,
liar.”

“Arya,
stop
it!”
Ned
shouted.
Jory
pulled
her
off
her
sister,
kicking.
Sansa
was
pale
and
shaking
as
Ned
lifted
her
back
to
her
feet.
“Are
you
hurt?”
he
asked,
but
she
was
staring
at
Arya,
and
she
did
not
seem
to
hear.

“The
girl
is
as
wild
as
that
filthy
animal
of
hers,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
“Robert,
I
want
her
punished.”

“Seven
hells,”
Robert
swore.
“Cersei,
look
at
her.
She’s
a
child.
What
would
you
have
me
do,
whip
her
through
the
streets?
Damn
it,
children
fight.
It’s
over.
No
lasting
harm
was
done.”

The
queen
was
furious.
“Joff
will
carry
those
scars
for
the
rest
of
his
life.”

Robert
Baratheon
looked
at
his
eldest
son.
“So
he
will.
Perhaps
they
will
teach
him
a
lesson.
Ned,
see
that
your
daughter
is
disciplined.
I
will
do
the
same
with
my
son.”

“Gladly,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
said
with
vast
relief.

Robert
started
to
walk
away,
but
the
queen
was
not
done.
“And
what
of
the
direwolf?”
she
called
after
him.
“What
of
the
beast
that
savaged
your
son?”

The
king
stopped,
turned
back,
frowned.
“I’d
forgotten
about
the
damned
wolf.”

Ned
could
see
Arya
tense
in
Jory’s
arms.
Jory
spoke
up
quickly.
“We
found
no
trace
of
the
direwolf,
Your
Grace.”

Robert
did
not
look
unhappy.
“No?
So
be
it.”

The
queen
raised
her
voice.
“A
hundred
golden
dragons
to
the
man
who
brings
me
its
skin!”

“A
costly
pelt,”
Robert
grumbled.
“I
want
no
part
of
this,
woman.
You
can
damn
well
buy
your
furs
with
Lannister
gold.”

The
queen
regarded
him
coolly.
“I
had
not
thought
you
so
niggardly.
The
king
I’d
thought
to
wed
would
have
laid
a
wolfskin
across
my
bed
before
the
sun
went
down.”

Robert’s
face
darkened
with
anger.
“That
would
be
a
fine
trick,
without
a
wolf.”

“We
have
a
wolf,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
Her
voice
was
very
quiet,
but
her
green
eyes
shone
with
triumph.

It
took
them
all
a
moment
to
comprehend
her
words,
but
when
they
did,
the
king
shrugged
irritably.
“As
you
will.
Have
Ser
Ilyn
see
to
it.”

“Robert,
you
cannot
mean
this,”
Ned
protested.

The
king
was
in
no
mood
for
more
argument.
“Enough,
Ned,
I
will
hear
no
more.
A
direwolf
is
a
savage
beast.
Sooner
or
later
it
would
have
turned
on
your
girl
the
same
way
the
other
did
on
my
son.
Get
her
a
dog,
she’ll
be
happier
for
it.”

That
was
when
Sansa
finally
seemed
to
comprehend.
Her
eyes
were
frightened
as
they
went
to
her
father.
“He
doesn’t
mean
Lady,
does
he?”
She
saw
the
truth
on
his
face.
“No,”
she
said.
“No,
not
Lady,
Lady
didn’t
bite
anybody,
she’s
good…”

“Lady
wasn’t
there,”
Arya
shouted
angrily.
“You
leave
her
alone!”

“Stop
them,”
Sansa
pleaded,
“don’t
let
them
do
it,
please,
please,
it
wasn’t
Lady,
it
was
Nymeria,
Arya
did
it,
you
can’t,
it
wasn’t
Lady,
don’t
let
them
hurt
Lady,
I’ll
make
her
be
good,
I
promise,
I
promise…”
She
started
to
cry.

All
Ned
could
do
was
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
while
she
wept.
He
looked
across
the
room
at
Robert.
His
old
friend,
closer
than
any
brother.
“Please,
Robert.
For
the
love
you
bear
me.
For
the
love
you
bore
my
sister.
Please.”

The
king
looked
at
them
for
a
long
moment,
then
turned
his
eyes
on
his
wife.
“Damn
you,
Cersei,”
he
said
with
loathing.

Ned
stood,
gently
disengaging
himself
from
Sansa’s
grasp.
All
the
weariness
of
the
past
four
days
had
returned
to
him.
“Do
it
yourself
then,
Robert,”
he
said
in
a
voice
cold
and
sharp
as
steel.
“At
least
have
the
courage
to
do
it
yourself.”

Robert
looked
at
Ned
with
flat,
dead
eyes
and
left
without
a
word,
his
footsteps
heavy
as
lead.
Silence
filled
the
hall.

“Where
is
the
direwolf?”
Cersei
Lannister
asked
when
her
husband
was
gone.
Beside
her,
Prince
Joffrey
was
smiling.

“The
beast
is
chained
up
outside
the
gatehouse,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
answered
reluctantly.

“Send
for
Ilyn
Payne.”

“No,”
Ned
said.
“Jory,
take
the
girls
back
to
their
rooms
and
bring
me
Ice.”
The
words
tasted
of
bile
in
his
throat,
but
he
forced
them
out.
“If
it
must
be
done,
I
will
do
it.”

Cersei
Lannister
regarded
him
suspiciously.
“You,
Stark?
Is
this
some
trick?
Why
would
you
do
such
a
thing?”

They
were
all
staring
at
him,
but
it
was
Sansa’s
look
that
cut.
“She
is
of
the
north.
She
deserves
better
than
a
butcher.”

He
left
the
room
with
his
eyes
burning
and
his
daughter’s
wails
echoing
in
his
ears,
and
found
the
direwolf
pup
where
they
chained
her.
Ned
sat
beside
her
for
a
while.
“Lady,”
he
said,
tasting
the
name.
He
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
names
the
children
had
picked,
but
looking
at
her
now,
he
knew
that
Sansa
had
chosen
well.
She
was
the
smallest
of
the
litter,
the
prettiest,
the
most
gentle
and
trusting.
She
looked
at
him
with
bright
golden
eyes,
and
he
ruffled
her
thick
grey
fur.

Shortly,
Jory
brought
him
Ice.

When
it
was
over,
he
said,
“Choose
four
men
and
have
them
take
the
body
north.
Bury
her
at
Winterfell.”

“All
that
way?”
Jory
said,
astonished.

“All
that
way,”
Ned
affirmed.
“The
Lannister
woman
shall
never
have
this
skin.”

He
was
walking
back
to
the
tower
to
give
himself
up
to
sleep
at
last
when
Sandor
Clegane
and
his
riders
came
pounding
through
the
castle
gate,
back
from
their
hunt.

There
was
something
slung
over
the
back
of
his
destrier,
a
heavy
shape
wrapped
in
a
bloody
cloak.
“No
sign
of
your
daughter,
Hand,”
the
Hound
rasped
down,
“but
the
day
was
not
wholly
wasted.
We
got
her
little
pet.”
He
reached
back
and
shoved
the
burden
off,
and
it
fell
with
a
thump
in
front
of
Ned.

Bending,
Ned
pulled
back
the
cloak,
dreading
the
words
he
would
have
to
find
for
Arya,
but
it
was
not
Nymeria
after
all.
It
was
the
butcher’s
boy,
Mycah,
his
body
covered
in
dried
blood.
He
had
been
cut
almost
in
half
from
shoulder
to
waist
by
some
terrible
blow
struck
from
above.

“You
rode
him
down,”
Ned
said.

The
Hound’s
eyes
seemed
to
glitter
through
the
steel
of
that
hideous
dog’s-head
helm.
“He
ran.”
He
looked
at
Ned’s
face
and
laughed.
“But
not
very
fast.”





BRAN

It
seemed
as
though
he
had
been
falling
for
years.

Fly,
a
voice
whispered
in
the
darkness,
but
Bran
did
not
know
how
to
fly,
so
all
he
could
do
was
fall.

Maester
Luwin
made
a
little
boy
of
clay,
baked
him
till
he
was
hard
and
brittle,
dressed
him
in
Bran’s
clothes,
and
flung
him
off
a
roof.
Bran
remembered
the
way
he
shattered.
“But
I
never
fall,”
he
said,
falling.

The
ground
was
so
far
below
him
he
could
barely
make
it
out
through
the
grey
mists
that
whirled
around
him,
but
he
could
feel
how
fast
he
was
falling,
and
he
knew
what
was
waiting
for
him
down
there.
Even
in
dreams,
you
could
not
fall
forever.
He
would
wake
up
in
the
instant
before
he
hit
the
ground,
he
knew.
You
always
woke
up
in
the
instant
before
you
hit
the
ground.

And
if
you
don’t?
the
voice
asked.

The
ground
was
closer
now,
still
far
far
away,
a
thousand
miles
away,
but
closer
than
it
had
been.
It
was
cold
here
in
the
darkness.
There
was
no
sun,
no
stars,
only
the
ground
below
coming
up
to
smash
him,
and
the
grey
mists,
and
the
whispering
voice.
He
wanted
to
cry.

Not
cry.
Fly.

“I
can’t
fly,”
Bran
said.
“I
can’t,
I
can’t…”

How
do
you
know?
Have
you
ever
tried?

The
voice
was
high
and
thin.
Bran
looked
around
to
see
where
it
was
coming
from.
A
crow
was
spiraling
down
with
him,
just
out
of
reach,
following
him
as
he
fell.
“Help
me,”
he
said.

I’m
trying,
the
crow
replied.
Say,
got
any
corn?

Bran
reached
into
his
pocket
as
the
darkness
spun
dizzily
around
him.
When
he
pulled
his
hand
out,
golden
kernels
slid
from
between
his
fingers
into
the
air.
They
fell
with
him.

The
crow
landed
on
his
hand
and
began
to
eat.

“Are
you
really
a
crow?”
Bran
asked.

Are
you
really
falling?
the
crow
asked
back.

“It’s
just
a
dream,”
Bran
said.

Is
it?
asked
the
crow.

“I’ll
wake
up
when
I
hit
the
ground,”
Bran
told
the
bird.

You’ll
die
when
you
hit
the
ground,
the
crow
said.
It
went
back
to
eating
corn.

Bran
looked
down.
He
could
see
mountains
now,
their
peaks
white
with
snow,
and
the
silver
thread
of
rivers
in
dark
woods.
He
closed
his
eyes
and
began
to
cry.

That
won’t
do
any
good,
the
crow
said.
I
told
you,
the
answer
is
flying,
not
crying.
How
hard
can
it
be?
I’m
doing
it.
The
crow
took
to
the
air
and
flapped
around
Bran’s
hand.

“You
have
wings,”
Bran
pointed
out.

Maybe
you
do
too.

Bran
felt
along
his
shoulders,
groping
for
feathers.

There
are
different
kinds
of
wings,
the
crow
said.

Bran
was
staring
at
his
arms,
his
legs.
He
was
so
skinny,
just
skin
stretched
taut
over
bones.
Had
he
always
been
so
thin?
He
tried
to
remember.
A
face
swam
up
at
him
out
of
the
grey
mist,
shining
with
light,
golden.
“The
things
I
do
for
love,”
it
said.

Bran
screamed.

The
crow
took
to
the
air,
cawing.
Not
that,
it
shrieked
at
him.
Forget
that,
you
do
not
need
it
now,
put
it
aside,
put
it
away.
It
landed
on
Bran’s
shoulder,
and
pecked
at
him,
and
the
shining
golden
face
was
gone.

Bran
was
falling
faster
than
ever.
The
grey
mists
howled
around
him
as
he
plunged
toward
the
earth
below.
“What
are
you
doing
to
me?”
he
asked
the
crow,
tearful.

Teaching
you
how
to
fly.

“I
can’t
fly!”

You’re
flying
tight
now.

“I’m
falling!”

Every
flight
begins
with
a
fall,
the
crow
said.
Look
down.

“I’m
afraid…”

LOOK
DOWN!

Bran
looked
down,
and
felt
his
insides
turn
to
water.
The
ground
was
rushing
up
at
him
now.
The
whole
world
was
spread
out
below
him,
a
tapestry
of
white
and
brown
and
green.
He
could
see
everything
so
clearly
that
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
be
afraid.
He
could
see
the
whole
realm,
and
everyone
in
it.

He
saw
Winterfell
as
the
eagles
see
it,
the
tall
towers
looking
squat
and
stubby
from
above,
the
castle
walls
just
lines
in
the
dirt.
He
saw
Maester
Luwin
on
his
balcony,
studying
the
sky
through
a
polished
bronze
tube
and
frowning
as
he
made
notes
in
a
book.
He
saw
his
brother
Robb,
taller
and
stronger
than
he
remembered
him,
practicing
swordplay
in
the
yard
with
real
steel
in
his
hand.
He
saw
Hodor,
the
simple
giant
from
the
stables,
carrying
an
anvil
to
Mikken’s
forge,
hefting
it
onto
his
shoulder
as
easily
as
another
man
might
heft
a
bale
of
hay.
At
the
heart
of
the
godswood,
the
great
white
weirwood
brooded
over
its
reflection
in
the
black
pool,
its
leaves
rustling
in
a
chill
wind.
When
it
felt
Bran
watching,
it
lifted
its
eyes
from
the
still
waters
and
stared
back
at
him
knowingly.

He
looked
east,
and
saw
a
galley
racing
across
the
waters
of
the
Bite.
He
saw
his
mother
sitting
alone
in
a
cabin,
looking
at
a
bloodstained
knife
on
a
table
in
front
of
her,
as
the
rowers
pulled
at
their
oars
and
Ser
Rodrik
leaned
across
a
rail,
shaking
and
heaving.
A
storm
was
gathering
ahead
of
them,
a
vast
dark
roaring
lashed
by
lightning,
but
somehow
they
could
not
see
it.

He
looked
south,
and
saw
the
great
blue-green
rush
of
the
Trident.
He
saw
his
father
pleading
with
the
king,
his
face
etched
with
grief.
He
saw
Sansa
crying
herself
to
sleep
at
night,
and
he
saw
Arya
watching
in
silence
and
holding
her
secrets
hard
in
her
heart.
There
were
shadows
all
around
them.
One
shadow
was
dark
as
ash,
with
the
terrible
face
of
a
hound.
Another
was
armored
like
the
sun,
golden
and
beautiful.
Over
them
both
loomed
a
giant
in
armor
made
of
stone,
but
when
he
opened
his
visor,
there
was
nothing
inside
but
darkness
and
thick
black
blood.

He
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
clear
across
the
narrow
sea,
to
the
Free
Cities
and
the
green
Dothraki
sea
and
beyond,
to
Vaes
Dothrak
under
its
mountain,
to
the
fabled
lands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
to
Asshai
by
the
Shadow,
where
dragons
stirred
beneath
the
sunrise.

Finally
he
looked
north.
He
saw
the
Wall
shining
like
blue
crystal,
and
his
bastard
brother
Jon
sleeping
alone
in
a
cold
bed,
his
skin
growing
pale
and
hard
as
the
memory
of
all
warmth
fled
from
him.
And
he
looked
past
the
Wall,
past
endless
forests
cloaked
in
snow,
past
the
frozen
shore
and
the
great
blue-white
rivers
of
ice
and
the
dead
plains
where
nothing
grew
or
lived.
North
and
north
and
north
he
looked,
to
the
curtain
of
light
at
the
end
of
the
world,
and
then
beyond
that
curtain.
He
looked
deep
into
the
heart
of
winter,
and
then
he
cried
out,
afraid,
and
the
heat
of
his
tears
burned
on
his
cheeks.

Now
you
know,
the
crow
whispered
as
it
sat
on
his
shoulder.
Now
you
know
why
you
must
live.

“Why?”
Bran
said,
not
understanding,
falling,
falling.

Because
winter
is
coming.

Bran
looked
at
the
crow
on
his
shoulder,
and
the
crow
looked
back.
It
had
three
eyes,
and
the
third
eye
was
full
of
a
terrible
knowledge.
Bran
looked
down.
There
was
nothing
below
him
now
but
snow
and
cold
and
death,
a
frozen
wasteland
where
jagged
blue-white
spires
of
ice
waited
to
embrace
him.
They
flew
up
at
him
like
spears.
He
saw
the
bones
of
a
thousand
other
dreamers
impaled
upon
their
points.
He
was
desperately
afraid.

“Can
a
man
still
be
brave
if
he’s
afraid?”
he
heard
his
own
voice
saying,
small
and
far
away.

And
his
father’s
voice
replied
to
him.
“That
is
the
only
time
a
man
can
be
brave.”

Now,
Bran,
the
crow
urged.
Choose.
Fly
or
die.

Death
reached
for
him,
screaming.

Bran
spread
his
arms
and
flew.

Wings
unseen
drank
the
wind
and
filled
and
pulled
him
upward.
The
terrible
needles
of
ice
receded
below
him.
The
sky
opened
up
above.
Bran
soared.
It
was
better
than
climbing.
It
was
better
than
anything.
The
world
grew
small
beneath
him.

“I’m
flying!”
he
cried
out
in
delight.

I’ve
noticed,
said
the
three-eyed
crow.
It
took
to
the
air,
flapping
its
wings
in
his
face,
slowing
him,
blinding
him.
He
faltered
in
the
air
as
its
pinions
beat
against
his
cheeks.
Its
beak
stabbed
at
him
fiercely,
and
Bran
felt
a
sudden
blinding
pain
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead,
between
his
eyes.

“What
are
you
doing?”
he
shrieked.

The
crow
opened
its
beak
and
cawed
at
him,
a
shrill
scream
of
fear,
and
the
grey
mists
shuddered
and
swirled
around
him
and
ripped
away
like
a
veil,
and
he
saw
that
the
crow
was
really
a
woman,
a
serving
woman
with
long
black
hair,
and
he
knew
her
from
somewhere,
from
Winterfell,
yes,
that
was
it,
he
remembered
her
now,
and
then
he
realized
that
he
was
in
Winterfell,
in
a
bed
high
in
some
chilly
tower
room,
and
the
black-haired
woman
dropped
a
basin
of
water
to
shatter
on
the
floor
and
ran
down
the
steps,
shouting,
“He’s
awake,
he’s
awake,
he’s
awake.”

Bran
touched
his
forehead,
between
his
eyes.
The
place
where
the
crow
had
pecked
him
was
still
burning,
but
there
was
nothing
there,
no
blood,
no
wound.
He
felt
weak
and
dizzy.
He
tried
to
get
out
of
bed,
but
nothing
happened.

And
then
there
was
movement
beside
the
bed,
and
something
landed
lightly
on
his
legs.
He
felt
nothing.
A
pair
of
yellow
eyes
looked
into
his
own,
shining
like
the
sun.
The
window
was
open
and
it
was
cold
in
the
room,
but
the
warmth
that
came
off
the
wolf
enfolded
him
like
a
hot
bath.
His
pup,
Bran
realized…
or
was
it?
He
was
so
big
now.
He
reached
out
to
pet
him,
his
hand
trembling
like
a
leaf.

When
his
brother
Robb
burst
into
the
room,
breathless
from
his
dash
up
the
tower
steps,
the
direwolf
was
licking
Bran’s
face.
Bran
looked
up
calmly.
“His
name
is
Summer,”
he
said.





CATELYN

“We
will
make
King’s
Landing
within
the
hour.”

Catelyn
turned
away
from
the
rail
and
forced
herself
to
smile.
“Your
oarmen
have
done
well
by
us,
Captain.
Each
one
of
them
shall
have
a
silver
stag,
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude.”

Captain
Moreo
Turnitis
favored
her
with
a
half
bow.
“You
are
far
too
generous,
Lady
Stark.
The
honor
of
carrying
a
great
lady
like
yourself
is
all
the
reward
they
need.”

“But
they’ll
take
the
silver
anyway.”

Moreo
smiled.
“As
you
say.”
He
spoke
the
Common
Tongue
fluently,
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
a
Tyroshi
accent.
He’d
been
plying
the
narrow
sea
for
thirty
years,
he’d
told
her,
as
oarman,
quartermaster,
and
finally
captain
of
his
own
trading
galleys.
The
Storm
Dancer
was
his
fourth
ship,
and
his
fastest,
a
two-masted
galley
of
sixty
oars.

She
had
certainly
been
the
fastest
of
the
ships
available
in
White
Harbor
when
Catelyn
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
had
arrived
after
their
headlong
gallop
downriver.
The
Tyroshi
were
notorious
for
their
avarice,
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
argued
for
hiring
a
fishing
sloop
out
of
the
Three
Sisters,
but
Catelyn
had
insisted
on
the
galley.
It
was
good
that
she
had.
The
winds
had
been
against
them
much
of
the
voyage,
and
without
the
galley’s
oars
they’d
still
be
beating
their
way
past
the
Fingers,
instead
of
skimming
toward
King’s
Landing
and
journey’s
end.

So
close,
she
thought.
Beneath
the
linen
bandages,
her
fingers
still
throbbed
where
the
dagger
had
bitten.
The
pain
was
her
scourge,
Catelyn
felt,
lest
she
forget.
She
could
not
bend
the
last
two
fingers
on
her
left
hand,
and
the
others
would
never
again
be
dexterous.
Yet
that
was
a
small
enough
price
to
pay
for
Bran’s
life.

Ser
Rodrik
chose
that
moment
to
appear
on
deck.
“My
good
friend,”
said
Moreo
through
his
forked
green
beard.
The
Tyroshi
loved
bright
colors,
even
in
their
facial
hair.
“It
is
so
fine
to
see
you
looking
better.”

“Yes,”
Ser
Rodrik
agreed.
“I
haven’t
wanted
to
die
for
almost
two
days
now.”
He
bowed
to
Catelyn.
“My
lady.”

He
was
looking
better.
A
shade
thinner
than
he
had
been
when
they
set
out
from
White
Harbor,
but
almost
himself
again.
The
strong
winds
in
the
Bite
and
the
roughness
of
the
narrow
sea
had
not
agreed
with
him,
and
he’d
almost
gone
over
the
side
when
the
storm
seized
them
unexpectedly
off
Dragonstone,
yet
somehow
he
had
clung
to
a
rope
until
three
of
Moreo’s
men
could
rescue
him
and
carry
him
safely
below
decks.

“The
captain
was
just
telling
me
that
our
voyage
is
almost
at
an
end,”
she
said.

Ser
Rodrik
managed
a
wry
smile.
“So
soon?”
He
looked
odd
without
his
great
white
side
whiskers;
smaller
somehow,
less
fierce,
and
ten
years
older.
Yet
back
on
the
Bite
it
had
seemed
prudent
to
submit
to
a
crewman’s
razor,
after
his
whiskers
had
become
hopelessly
befouled
for
the
third
time
while
he
leaned
over
the
rail
and
retched
into
the
swirling
winds.

“I
will
leave
you
to
discuss
your
business,”
Captain
Moreo
said.
He
bowed
and
took
his
leave
of
them.

The
galley
skimmed
the
water
like
a
dragonfly,
her
oars
rising
and
falling
in
perfect
time.
Ser
Rodrik
held
the
rail
and
looked
out
over
the
passing
shore.
“I
have
not
been
the
most
valiant
of
protectors.”

Catelyn
touched
his
arm.
“We
are
here,
Ser
Rodrik,
and
safely.
That
is
all
that
truly
matters.”
Her
hand
groped
beneath
her
cloak,
her
fingers
stiff
and
fumbling.
The
dagger
was
still
at
her
side.
She
found
she
had
to
touch
it
now
and
then,
to
reassure
herself.
“Now
we
must
reach
the
king’s
master-at-arms,
and
pray
that
he
can
be
trusted.”

“Ser
Aron
Santagar
is
a
vain
man,
but
an
honest
one.”
Ser
Rodrik’s
hand
went
to
his
face
to
stroke
his
whiskers
and
discovered
once
again
that
they
were
gone.
He
looked
nonplussed.
“He
may
know
the
blade,
yes…
but,
my
lady,
the
moment
we
go
ashore
we
are
at
risk.
And
there
are
those
at
court
who
will
know
you
on
sight.”

Catelyn’s
mouth
grew
tight.
“Littlefinger,”
she
murmured.
His
face
swam
up
before
her;
a
boy’s
face,
though
he
was
a
boy
no
longer.
His
father
had
died
several
years
before,
so
he
was
Lord
Baelish
now,
yet
still
they
called
him
Littlefinger.
Her
brother
Edmure
had
given
him
that
name,
long
ago
at
Riverrun.
His
family’s
modest
holdings
were
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers,
and
Petyr
had
been
slight
and
short
for
his
age.

Ser
Rodrik
cleared
his
throat.
“Lord
Baelish
once,
ah…”
His
thought
trailed
off
uncertainly
in
search
of
the
polite
word.

Catelyn
was
past
delicacy.
“He
was
my
father’s
ward.
We
grew
up
together
in
Riverrun.
I
thought
of
him
as
a
brother,
but
his
feelings
for
me
were…
more
than
brotherly.
When
it
was
announced
that
I
was
to
wed
Brandon
Stark,
Petyr
challenged
for
the
right
to
my
hand.
It
was
madness.
Brandon
was
twenty,
Petyr
scarcely
fifteen.
I
had
to
beg
Brandon
to
spare
Petyr’s
life.
He
let
him
off
with
a
scar.
Afterward
my
father
sent
him
away.
I
have
not
seen
him
since.”
She
lifted
her
face
to
the
spray,
as
if
the
brisk
wind
could
blow
the
memories
away.
“He
wrote
to
me
at
Riverrun
after
Brandon
was
killed,
but
I
burned
the
letter
unread.
By
then
I
knew
that
Ned
would
marry
me
in
his
brother’s
place.”

Ser
Rodrik’s
fingers
fumbled
once
again
for
nonexistent
whiskers.
“Littlefinger
sits
on
the
small
council
now.”

“I
knew
he
would
rise
high,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
was
always
clever,
even
as
a
boy,
but
it
is
one
thing
to
be
clever
and
another
to
be
wise.
I
wonder
what
the
years
have
done
to
him.”

High
overhead,
the
far-eyes
sang
out
from
the
rigging.
Captain
Moreo
came
scrambling
across
the
deck,
giving
orders,
and
all
around
them
the
Storm
Dancer
burst
into
frenetic
activity
as
King’s
Landing
slid
into
view
atop
its
three
high
hills.

Three
hundred
years
ago,
Catelyn
knew,
those
heights
had
been
covered
with
forest,
and
only
a
handful
of
fisherfolk
had
lived
on
the
north
shore
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
where
that
deep,
swift
river
flowed
into
the
sea.
Then
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
sailed
from
Dragonstone.
It
was
here
that
his
army
had
put
ashore,
and
there
on
the
highest
hill
that
he
built
his
first
crude
redoubt
of
wood
and
earth.

Now
the
city
covered
the
shore
as
far
as
Catelyn
could
see;
manses
and
arbors
and
granaries,
brick
storehouses
and
timbered
inns
and
merchant’s
stalls,
taverns
and
graveyards
and
brothels,
all
piled
one
on
another.
She
could
hear
the
clamor
of
the
fish
market
even
at
this
distance.
Between
the
buildings
were
broad
roads
lined
with
trees,
wandering
crookback
streets,
and
alleys
so
narrow
that
two
men
could
not
walk
abreast.
Visenya’s
hill
was
crowned
by
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
with
its
seven
crystal
towers.
Across
the
city
on
the
hill
of
Rhaenys
stood
the
blackened
walls
of
the
Dragonpit,
its
huge
dome
collapsing
into
ruin,
its
bronze
doors
closed
now
for
a
century.
The
Street
of
the
Sisters
ran
between
them,
straight
as
an
arrow.
The
city
walls
rose
in
the
distance,
high
and
strong.

A
hundred
quays
lined
the
waterfront,
and
the
harbor
was
crowded
with
ships.
Deepwater
fishing
boats
and
river
runners
came
and
went,
ferrymen
poled
back
and
forth
across
the
Blackwater
Rush,
trading
galleys
unloaded
goods
from
Braavos
and
Pentos
and
Lys.
Catelyn
spied
the
queen’s
ornate
barge,
tied
up
beside
a
fat-bellied
whaler
from
the
Port
of
Ibben,
its
hull
black
with
tar,
while
upriver
a
dozen
lean
golden
warships
rested
in
their
cribs,
sails
furled
and
cruel
iron
rams
lapping
at
the
water.

And
above
it
all,
frowning
down
from
Aegon’s
high
hill,
was
the
Red
Keep;
seven
huge
drum-towers
crowned
with
iron
ramparts,
an
immense
grim
barbican,
vaulted
halls
and
covered
bridges,
barracks
and
dungeons
and
granaries,
massive
curtain
walls
studded
with
archers’
nests,
all
fashioned
of
pale
red
stone.
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
commanded
it
built.
His
son
Maegor
the
Cruel
had
seen
it
completed.
Afterward
he
had
taken
the
heads
of
every
stonemason,
woodworker,
and
builder
who
had
labored
on
it.
Only
the
blood
of
the
dragon
would
ever
know
the
secrets
of
the
fortress
the
Dragonlords
had
built,
he
vowed.

Yet
now
the
banners
that
flew
from
its
battlements
were
golden,
not
black,
and
where
the
three-headed
dragon
had
once
breathed
fire,
now
pranced
the
crowned
stag
of
House
Baratheon.

A
high-masted
swan
ship
from
the
Summer
Isles
was
beating
out
from
port,
its
white
sails
huge
with
wind.
The
Storm
Dancer
moved
past
it,
pulling
steadily
for
shore.

“My
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
“I
have
thought
on
how
best
to
proceed
while
I
lay
abed.
You
must
not
enter
the
castle.
I
will
go
in
your
stead
and
bring
Ser
Aron
to
you
in
some
safe
place.”

She
studied
the
old
knight
as
the
galley
drew
near
to
a
pier.
Moreo
was
shouting
in
the
vulgar
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities.
“You
would
be
as
much
at
risk
as
I
would.”

Ser
Rodrik
smiled.
“I
think
not.
I
looked
at
my
reflection
in
the
water
earlier
and
scarcely
recognized
myself.
My
mother
was
the
last
person
to
see
me
without
whiskers,
and
she
is
forty
years
dead.
I
believe
I
am
safe
enough,
my
lady.”

Moreo
bellowed
a
command.
As
one,
sixty
oars
lifted
from
the
river,
then
reversed
and
backed
water.
The
galley
slowed.
Another
shout.
The
oars
slid
back
inside
the
hull.
As
they
thumped
against
the
dock,
Tyroshi
seamen
leapt
down
to
tie
up.
Moreo
came
bustling
up,
all
smiles.
“King’s
Landing,
my
lady,
as
you
did
command,
and
never
has
a
ship
made
a
swifter
or
surer
passage.
Will
you
be
needing
assistance
to
carry
your
things
to
the
castle?”

“We
shall
not
be
going
to
the
castle.
Perhaps
you
can
suggest
an
inn,
someplace
clean
and
comfortable
and
not
too
far
from
the
river.”

The
Tyroshi
fingered
his
forked
green
beard.
“Just
so.
I
know
of
several
establishments
that
might
suit
your
needs.
Yet
first,
if
I
may
be
so
bold,
there
is
the
matter
of
the
second
half
of
the
payment
we
agreed
upon.
And
of
course
the
extra
silver
you
were
so
kind
as
to
promise.
Sixty
stags,
I
believe
it
was.”

“For
the
oarmen,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

“Oh,
of
a
certainty,”
said
Moreo.
“Though
perhaps
I
should
hold
it
for
them
until
we
return
to
Tyrosh.
For
the
sake
of
their
wives
and
children.
If
you
give
them
the
silver
here,
my
lady,
they
will
dice
it
away
or
spend
it
all
for
a
night’s
pleasure.”

“There
are
worse
things
to
spend
money
on,”
Ser
Rodrik
put
in.
“Winter
is
coming.”

“A
man
must
make
his
own
choices,”
Catelyn
said.
“They
earned
the
silver.
How
they
spend
it
is
no
concern
of
mine.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady,”
Moreo
replied,
bowing
and
smiling.

Just
to
be
sure,
Catelyn
paid
the
oarmen
herself,
a
stag
to
each
man,
and
a
copper
to
the
two
men
who
carried
their
chests
halfway
up
Visenya’s
hill
to
the
inn
that
Moreo
had
suggested.
It
was
a
rambling
old
place
on
Eel
Alley.
The
woman
who
owned
it
was
a
sour
crone
with
a
wandering
eye
who
looked
them
over
suspiciously
and
bit
the
coin
that
Catelyn
offered
her
to
make
sure
it
was
real.
Her
rooms
were
large
and
airy,
though,
and
Moreo
swore
that
her
fish
stew
was
the
most
savory
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Best
of
all,
she
had
no
interest
in
their
names.

“I
think
it
best
if
you
stay
away
from
the
common
room,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
after
they
had
settled
in.
“Even
in
a
place
like
this,
one
never
knows
who
may
be
watching.”
He
wore
ringmail,
dagger,
and
longsword
under
a
dark
cloak
with
a
hood
he
could
pull
up
over
his
head.
“I
will
be
back
before
nightfall,
with
Ser
Aron,”
he
promised.
“Rest
now,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
was
tired.
The
voyage
had
been
long
and
fatiguing,
and
she
was
no
longer
as
young
as
she
had
been.
Her
windows
opened
on
the
alley
and
rooftops,
with
a
view
of
the
Blackwater
beyond.
She
watched
Ser
Rodrik
set
off,
striding
briskly
through
the
busy
streets
until
he
was
lost
in
the
crowds,
then
decided
to
take
his
advice.
The
bedding
was
stuffed
with
straw
instead
of
feathers,
but
she
had
no
trouble
falling
asleep.

She
woke
to
a
pounding
on
her
door.

Catelyn
sat
up
sharply.
Outside
the
window,
the
rooftops
of
King’s
Landing
were
red
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
She
had
slept
longer
than
she
intended.
A
fist
hammered
at
her
door
again,
and
a
voice
called
out,
“Open,
in
the
name
of
the
king.”

“A
moment,”
she
called
out.
She
wrapped
herself
in
her
cloak.
The
dagger
was
on
the
bedside
table.
She
snatched
it
up
before
she
unlatched
the
heavy
wooden
door.

The
men
who
pushed
into
the
room
wore
the
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch.
Their
leader
smiled
at
the
dagger
in
her
hand
and
said,
“No
need
for
that,
m’lady.
We’re
to
escort
you
to
the
castle.”

“By
whose
authority?”
she
said.

He
showed
her
a
ribbon.
Catelyn
felt
her
breath
catch
in
her
throat.
The
seal
was
a
mockingbird,
in
grey
wax.
“Petyr,”
she
said.
So
soon.
Something
must
have
happened
to
Ser
Rodrik.
She
looked
at
the
head
guardsman.
“Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“No,
m’lady,”
he
said.
“M’lord
Littlefinger
said
only
to
bring
you
to
him,
and
see
that
you
were
not
mistreated.”

Catelyn
nodded.
“You
may
wait
outside
while
I
dress.”

She
bathed
her
hands
in
the
basin
and
wrapped
them
in
clean
linen.
Her
fingers
were
thick
and
awkward
as
she
struggled
to
lace
up
her
bodice
and
knot
a
drab
brown
cloak
about
her
neck.
How
could
Littlefinger
have
known
she
was
here?
Ser
Rodrik
would
never
have
told
him.
Old
he
might
be,
but
he
was
stubborn,
and
loyal
to
a
fault.
Were
they
too
late,
had
the
Lannisters
reached
King’s
Landing
before
her?
No,
if
that
were
true,
Ned
would
be
here
too,
and
surely
he
would
have
come
to
her.
How…?

Then
she
thought,
Moreo.
The
Tyroshi
knew
who
they
were
and
where
they
were,
damn
him.
She
hoped
he’d
gotten
a
good
price
for
the
information.

They
had
brought
a
horse
for
her.
The
lamps
were
being
lit
along
the
streets
as
they
set
out,
and
Catelyn
felt
the
eyes
of
the
city
on
her
as
she
rode,
surrounded
by
the
guard
in
their
golden
cloaks.
When
they
reached
the
Red
Keep,
the
portcullis
was
down
and
the
great
gates
sealed
for
the
night,
but
the
castle
windows
were
alive
with
flickering
lights.
The
guardsmen
left
their
mounts
outside
the
walls
and
escorted
her
through
a
narrow
postern
door,
then
up
endless
steps
to
a
tower.

He
was
alone
in
the
room,
seated
at
a
heavy
wooden
table,
an
oil
lamp
beside
him
as
he
wrote.
When
they
ushered
her
inside,
he
set
down
his
pen
and
looked
at
her.
“Cat,”
he
said
quietly.

“Why
have
I
been
brought
here
in
this
fashion?”

He
rose
and
gestured
brusquely
to
the
guards.
“Leave
us.”
The
men
departed.
“You
were
not
mistreated,
I
trust,”
he
said
after
they
had
gone.
“I
gave
firm
instructions.”
He
noticed
her
bandages.
“Your
hands…”

Catelyn
ignored
the
implied
question.
“I
am
not
accustomed
to
being
summoned
like
a
serving
wench,”
she
said
icily.
“As
a
boy,
you
still
knew
the
meaning
of
courtesy.”

“I’ve
angered
you,
my
lady.
That
was
never
my
intent.”
He
looked
contrite.
The
look
brought
back
vivid
memories
for
Catelyn.
He
had
been
a
sly
child,
but
after
his
mischiefs
he
always
looked
contrite;
it
was
a
gift
he
had.
The
years
had
not
changed
him
much.
Petyr
had
been
a
small
boy,
and
he
had
grown
into
a
small
man,
an
inch
or
two
shorter
than
Catelyn,
slender
and
quick,
with
the
sharp
features
she
remembered
and
the
same
laughing
grey-green
eyes.
He
had
a
little
pointed
chin
beard
now,
and
threads
of
silver
in
his
dark
hair,
though
he
was
still
shy
of
thirty.
They
went
well
with
the
silver
mockingbird
that
fastened
his
cloak.
Even
as
a
child,
he
had
always
loved
his
silver.

“How
did
you
know
I
was
in
the
city?”
she
asked
him.

“Lord
Varys
knows
all,”
Petyr
said
with
a
sly
smile.
“He
will
be
joining
us
shortly,
but
I
wanted
to
see
you
alone
first.
It
has
been
too
long,
Cat.
How
many
years?”

Catelyn
ignored
his
familiarity.
There
were
more
important
questions.
“So
it
was
the
King’s
Spider
who
found
me.”

Littlefinger
winced.
“You
don’t
want
to
call
him
that.
He’s
very
sensitive.
Comes
of
being
an
eunuch,
I
imagine.
Nothing
happens
in
this
city
without
Varys
knowing.
Oftimes
he
knows
about
it
before
it
happens.
He
has
informants
everywhere.
His
little
birds,
he
calls
them.
One
of
his
little
birds
heard
about
your
visit.
Thankfully,
Varys
came
to
me
first.”

“Why
you?”

He
shrugged.
“Why
not
me?
I
am
master
of
coin,
the
king’s
own
councillor.
Selmy
and
Lord
Renly
rode
north
to
meet
Robert,
and
Lord
Stannis
is
gone
to
Dragonstone,
leaving
only
Maester
Pycelle
and
me.
I
was
the
obvious
choice.
I
was
ever
a
friend
to
your
sister
Lysa,
Varys
knows
that.”

“Does
Varys
know
about…”

“Lord
Varys
knows
everything…
except
why
you
are
here.”
He
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Why
are
you
here?”

“A
wife
is
allowed
to
yearn
for
her
husband,
and
if
a
mother
needs
her
daughters
close,
who
can
tell
her
no?”

Littlefinger
laughed.
“Oh,
very
good,
my
lady,
but
please
don’t
expect
me
to
believe
that.
I
know
you
too
well.
What
were
the
Tully
words
again?”

Her
throat
was
dry.
“Family,
Duty,
Honor,”
she
recited
stiffly.
He
did
know
her
too
well.

“Family,
Duty,
Honor,”
he
echoed.
“All
of
which
required
you
to
remain
in
Winterfell,
where
our
Hand
left
you.
No,
my
lady,
something
has
happened.
This
sudden
trip
of
yours
bespeaks
a
certain
urgency.
I
beg
of
you,
let
me
help.
Old
sweet
friends
should
never
hesitate
to
rely
upon
each
other.”
There
was
a
soft
knock
on
the
door.
“Enter,”
Littlefinger
called
out.

The
man
who
stepped
through
the
door
was
plump,
perfumed,
powdered,
and
as
hairless
as
an
egg.
He
wore
a
vest
of
woven
gold
thread
over
a
loose
gown
of
purple
silk,
and
on
his
feet
were
pointed
slippers
of
soft
velvet.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said,
taking
her
hand
in
both
of
his,
“to
see
you
again
after
so
many
years
is
such
a
joy.”
His
flesh
was
soft
and
moist,
and
his
breath
smelled
of
lilacs.
“Oh,
your
poor
hands.
Have
you
burned
yourself,
sweet
lady?
The
fingers
are
so
delicate…
Our
good
Maester
Pycelle
makes
a
marvelous
salve,
shall
I
send
for
a
jar?”

Catelyn
slid
her
fingers
from
his
grasp.
“I
thank
you,
my
lord,
but
my
own
Maester
Luwin
has
already
seen
to
my
hurts.”

Varys
bobbed
his
head.
“I
was
grievous
sad
to
hear
about
your
son.
And
him
so
young.
The
gods
are
cruel.”

“On
that
we
agree,
Lord
Varys,”
she
said.
The
title
was
but
a
courtesy
due
him
as
a
council
member;
Varys
was
lord
of
nothing
but
the
spiderweb,
the
master
of
none
but
his
whisperers.

The
eunuch
spread
his
soft
hands.
“On
more
than
that,
I
hope,
sweet
lady.
I
have
great
esteem
for
your
husband,
our
new
Hand,
and
I
know
we
do
both
love
King
Robert.”

“Yes,”
she
was
forced
to
say.
“For
a
certainty.”

“Never
has
a
king
been
so
beloved
as
our
Robert,”
quipped
Littlefinger.
He
smiled
slyly.
“At
least
in
Lord
Varys’s
hearing.”

“Good
lady,”
Varys
said
with
great
solicitude.
“There
are
men
in
the
Free
Cities
with
wondrous
healing
powers.
Say
only
the
word,
and
I
will
send
for
one
for
your
dear
Bran.”

“Maester
Luwin
is
doing
all
that
can
be
done
for
Bran,”
she
told
him.
She
would
not
speak
of
Bran,
not
here,
not
with
these
men.
She
trusted
Littlefinger
only
a
little,
and
Varys
not
at
all.
She
would
not
let
them
see
her
grief.
“Lord
Baelish
tells
me
that
I
have
you
to
thank
for
bringing
me
here.”

Varys
giggled
like
a
little
girl.
“Oh,
yes.
I
suppose
I
am
guilty.
I
hope
you
forgive
me,
kind
lady.”
He
eased
himself
down
into
a
seat
and
put
his
hands
together.
“I
wonder
if
we
might
trouble
you
to
show
us
the
dagger?”

Catelyn
Stark
stared
at
the
eunuch
in
stunned
disbelief.
He
was
a
spider,
she
thought
wildly,
an
enchanter
or
worse.
He
knew
things
no
one
could
possibly
know,
unless…“What
have
you
done
to
Ser
Rodrik?”
she
demanded.

Littlefinger
was
lost.
“I
feel
rather
like
the
knight
who
arrives
at
the
battle
without
his
lance.
What
dagger
are
we
talking
about?
Who
is
Ser
Rodrik?”

“Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
is
master-at-arms
at
Winterfell,”
Varys
informed
him.
“I
assure
you,
Lady
Stark,
nothing
at
all
has
been
done
to
the
good
knight.
He
did
call
here
early
this
afternoon.
He
visited
with
Ser
Aron
Santagar
in
the
armory,
and
they
talked
of
a
certain
dagger.
About
sunset,
they
left
the
castle
together
and
walked
to
that
dreadful
hovel
where
you
were
staying.
They
are
still
there,
drinking
in
the
common
room,
waiting
for
your
return.
Ser
Rodrik
was
very
distressed
to
find
you
gone.”

“How
could
you
know
all
that?”

“The
whisperings
of
little
birds,”
Varys
said,
smiling.
“I
know
things,
sweet
lady.
That
is
the
nature
of
my
service.”
He
shrugged.
“You
do
have
the
dagger
with
you,
yes?”

Catelyn
pulled
it
out
from
beneath
her
cloak
and
threw
it
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
him.
“Here.
Perhaps
your
little
birds
will
whisper
the
name
of
the
man
it
belongs
to.”

Varys
lifted
the
knife
with
exaggerated
delicacy
and
ran
a
thumb
along
its
edge.
Blood
welled,
and
he
let
out
a
squeal
and
dropped
the
dagger
back
on
the
table.

“Careful,”
Catelyn
told
him,
“it’s
sharp.”

“Nothing
holds
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel,”
Littlefinger
said
as
Varys
sucked
at
his
bleeding
thumb
and
looked
at
Catelyn
with
sullen
admonition.
Littlefinger
hefted
the
knife
lightly
in
his
hand,
testing
the
grip.
He
flipped
it
in
the
air,
caught
it
again
with
his
other
hand.
“Such
sweet
balance.
You
want
to
find
the
owner,
is
that
the
reason
for
this
visit?
You
have
no
need
of
Ser
Aron
for
that,
my
lady.
You
should
have
come
to
me.”

“And
if
I
had,”
she
said,
“what
would
you
have
told
me?”

“I
would
have
told
you
that
there
was
only
one
knife
like
this
at
King’s
Landing.”
He
grasped
the
blade
between
thumb
and
forefinger,
drew
it
back
over
his
shoulder,
and
threw
it
across
the
room
with
a
practiced
flick
of
his
wrist.
It
struck
the
door
and
buried
itself
deep
in
the
oak,
quivering.
“It’s
mine.”

“Yours?”
It
made
no
sense.
Petyr
had
not
been
at
Winterfell.

“Until
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day,”
he
said,
crossing
the
room
to
wrench
the
dagger
from
the
wood.
“I
backed
Ser
Jaime
in
the
jousting,
along
with
half
the
court.”
Petyr’s
sheepish
grin
made
him
look
half
a
boy
again.
“When
Loras
Tyrell
unhorsed
him,
many
of
us
became
a
trifle
poorer.
Ser
Jaime
lost
a
hundred
golden
dragons,
the
queen
lost
an
emerald
pendant,
and
I
lost
my
knife.
Her
Grace
got
the
emerald
back,
but
the
winner
kept
the
rest.”

“Who?”
Catelyn
demanded,
her
mouth
dry
with
fear.
Her
fingers
ached
with
remembered
pain.

“The
Imp,”
said
Littlefinger
as
Lord
Varys
watched
her
face.
“Tyrion
Lannister.”





JON

The
courtyard
rang
to
the
song
of
swords.

Under
black
wool,
boiled
leather,
and
mail,
sweat
trickled
icily
down
Jon’s
chest
as
he
pressed
the
attack.
Grenn
stumbled
backward,
defending
himself
clumsily.
When
he
raised
his
sword,
Jon
went
underneath
it
with
a
sweeping
blow
that
crunched
against
the
back
of
the
other
boy’s
leg
and
sent
him
staggering.
Grenn’s
downcut
was
answered
by
an
overhand
that
dented
his
helm.
When
he
tried
a
sideswing,
Jon
swept
aside
his
blade
and
slammed
a
mailed
forearm
into
his
chest.
Grenn
lost
his
footing
and
sat
down
hard
in
the
snow.
Jon
knocked
his
sword
from
his
fingers
with
a
slash
to
his
wrist
that
brought
a
cry
of
pain.

“Enough!”
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
had
a
voice
with
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel.

Grenn
cradled
his
hand.
“The
bastard
broke
my
wrist.”

“The
bastard
hamstrung
you,
opened
your
empty
skull,
and
cut
off
your
hand.
Or
would
have,
if
these
blades
had
an
edge.
It’s
fortunate
for
you
that
the
Watch
needs
stableboys
as
well
as
rangers.”
Ser
Alliser
gestured
at
Jeren
and
Toad.
“Get
the
Aurochs
on
his
feet,
he
has
funeral
arrangements
to
make.”

Jon
took
off
his
helm
as
the
other
boys
were
pulling
Grenn
to
his
feet.
The
frosty
morning
air
felt
good
on
his
face.
He
leaned
on
his
sword,
drew
a
deep
breath,
and
allowed
himself
a
moment
to
savor
the
victory.

“That
is
a
longsword,
not
an
old
man’s
cane,”
Ser
Alliser
said
sharply.
“Are
your
legs
hurting,
Lord
Snow?”

Jon
hated
that
name,
a
mockery
that
Ser
Alliser
had
hung
on
him
the
first
day
he
came
to
practice.
The
boys
had
picked
it
up,
and
now
he
heard
it
everywhere.
He
slid
the
longsword
back
into
its
scabbard.
“No,”
he
replied.

Thorne
strode
toward
him,
crisp
black
leathers
whispering
faintly
as
he
moved.
He
was
a
compact
man
of
fifty
years,
spare
and
hard,
with
grey
in
his
black
hair
and
eyes
like
chips
of
onyx.
“The
truth
now,”
he
commanded.

“I’m
tired,”
Jon
admitted.
His
arm
burned
from
the
weight
of
the
longsword,
and
he
was
starting
to
feel
his
bruises
now
that
the
fight
was
done.

“What
you
are
is
weak.”

“I
won.”

“No.
The
Aurochs
lost.”

One
of
the
other
boys
sniggered.
Jon
knew
better
than
to
reply.
He
had
beaten
everyone
that
Ser
Alliser
had
sent
against
him,
yet
it
gained
him
nothing.
The
master-at-arms
served
up
only
derision.
Thorne
hated
him,
Jon
had
decided;
of
course,
he
hated
the
other
boys
even
worse.

“That
will
be
all,”
Thorne
told
them.
“I
can
only
stomach
so
much
ineptitude
in
any
one
day.
If
the
Others
ever
come
for
us,
I
pray
they
have
archers,
because
you
lot
are
fit
for
nothing
more
than
arrow
fodder.”

Jon
followed
the
rest
back
to
the
armory,
walking
alone.
He
often
walked
alone
here.
There
were
almost
twenty
in
the
group
he
trained
with,
yet
not
one
he
could
call
a
friend.
Most
were
two
or
three
years
his
senior,
yet
not
one
was
half
the
fighter
Robb
had
been
at
fourteen.
Dareon
was
quick
but
afraid
of
being
hit.
Pyp
used
his
sword
like
a
dagger,
Jeren
was
weak
as
a
girl,
Grenn
slow
and
clumsy.
Halder’s
blows
were
brutally
hard
but
he
ran
right
into
your
attacks.
The
more
time
he
spent
with
them,
the
more
Jon
despised
them.

Inside,
Jon
hung
sword
and
scabbard
from
a
hook
in
the
stone
wall,
ignoring
the
others
around
him.
Methodically,
he
began
to
strip
off
his
mail,
leather,
and
sweat-soaked
woolens.
Chunks
of
coal
burned
in
iron
braziers
at
either
end
of
the
long
room,
but
Jon
found
himself
shivering.
The
chill
was
always
with
him
here.
In
a
few
years
he
would
forget
what
it
felt
like
to
be
warm.

The
weariness
came
on
him
suddenly,
as
he
donned
the
roughspun
blacks
that
were
their
everyday
wear.
He
sat
on
a
bench,
his
fingers
fumbling
with
the
fastenings
on
his
cloak.
So
cold,
he
thought,
remembering
the
warm
halls
of
Winterfell,
where
the
hot
waters
ran
through
the
walls
like
blood
through
a
man’s
body.
There
was
scant
warmth
to
be
found
in
Castle
Black;
the
walls
were
cold
here,
and
the
people
colder.

No
one
had
told
him
the
Night’s
Watch
would
be
like
this;
no
one
except
Tyrion
Lannister.
The
dwarf
had
given
him
the
truth
on
the
road
north,
but
by
then
it
had
been
too
late.
Jon
wondered
if
his
father
had
known
what
the
Wall
would
be
like.
He
must
have,
he
thought;
that
only
made
it
hurt
the
worse.

Even
his
uncle
had
abandoned
him
in
this
cold
place
at
the
end
of
the
world.
Up
here,
the
genial
Benjen
Stark
he
had
known
became
a
different
person.
He
was
First
Ranger,
and
he
spent
his
days
and
nights
with
Lord
Commander
Mormont
and
Maester
Aemon
and
the
other
high
officers,
while
Jon
was
given
over
to
the
less
than
tender
charge
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.

Three
days
after
their
arrival,
Jon
had
heard
that
Benjen
Stark
was
to
lead
a
half-dozen
men
on
a
ranging
into
the
haunted
forest.
That
night
he
sought
out
his
uncle
in
the
great
timbered
common
hall
and
pleaded
to
go
with
him.
Benjen
refused
him
curtly.
“This
is
not
Winterfell,”
he
told
him
as
he
cut
his
meat
with
fork
and
dagger.
“On
the
Wall,
a
man
gets
only
what
he
earns.
You’re
no
ranger,
Jon,
only
a
green
boy
with
the
smell
of
summer
still
on
you.”

Stupidly,
Jon
argued.
“I’ll
be
fifteen
on
my
name
day,”
he
said.
“Almost
a
man
grown.”

Benjen
Stark
frowned.
“A
boy
you
are,
and
a
boy
you’ll
remain
until
Ser
Alliser
says
you
are
fit
to
be
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
If
you
thought
your
Stark
blood
would
win
you
easy
favors,
you
were
wrong.
We
put
aside
our
old
families
when
we
swear
our
vows.
Your
father
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart,
but
these
are
my
brothers
now.”
He
gestured
with
his
dagger
at
the
men
around
them,
all
the
hard
cold
men
in
black.

Jon
rose
at
dawn
the
next
day
to
watch
his
uncle
leave.
One
of
his
rangers,
a
big
ugly
man,
sang
a
bawdy
song
as
he
saddled
his
garron,
his
breath
steaming
in
the
cold
morning
air.
Ben
Stark
smiled
at
that,
but
he
had
no
smile
for
his
nephew.
“How
often
must
I
tell
you
no,
Jon?
We’ll
speak
when
I
return.”

As
he
watched
his
uncle
lead
his
horse
into
the
tunnel,
Jon
had
remembered
the
things
that
Tyrion
Lannister
told
him
on
the
kingsroad,
and
in
his
mind’s
eye
he
saw
Ben
Stark
lying
dead,
his
blood
red
on
the
snow.
The
thought
made
him
sick.
What
was
he
becoming?

Afterward
he
sought
out
Ghost
in
the
loneliness
of
his
cell,
and
buried
his
face
in
his
thick
white
fur.

If
he
must
be
alone,
he
would
make
solitude
his
armor.
Castle
Black
had
no
godswood,
only
a
small
sept
and
a
drunken
septon,
but
Jon
could
not
find
it
in
him
to
pray
to
any
gods,
old
or
new.
If
they
were
real,
he
thought,
they
were
as
cruel
and
implacable
as
winter.

He
missed
his
true
brothers:
little
Rickon,
bright
eyes
shining
as
he
begged
for
a
sweet;
Robb,
his
rival
and
best
friend
and
constant
companion;
Bran,
stubborn
and
curious,
always
wanting
to
follow
and
join
in
whatever
Jon
and
Robb
were
doing.
He
missed
the
girls
too,
even
Sansa,
who
never
called
him
anything
but
“my
half
brother”
since
she
was
old
enough
to
understand
what
bastard
meant.
And
Arya…
he
missed
her
even
more
than
Robb,
skinny
little
thing
that
she
was,
all
scraped
knees
and
tangled
hair
and
torn
clothes,
so
fierce
and
willful.
Arya
never
seemed
to
fit,
no
more
than
he
had…
yet
she
could
always
make
Jon
smile.
He
would
give
anything
to
be
with
her
now,
to
muss
up
her
hair
once
more
and
watch
her
make
a
face,
to
hear
her
finish
a
sentence
with
him.

“You
broke
my
wrist,
bastard
boy.”

Jon
lifted
his
eyes
at
the
sullen
voice.
Grenn
loomed
over
him,
thick
of
neck
and
red
of
face,
with
three
of
his
friends
behind
him.
He
knew
Todder,
a
short
ugly
boy
with
an
unpleasant
voice.
The
recruits
all
called
him
Toad.
The
other
two
were
the
ones
Yoren
had
brought
north
with
them,
Jon
remembered,
rapers
taken
down
in
the
Fingers.
He’d
forgotten
their
names.
He
hardly
ever
spoke
to
them,
if
he
could
help
it.
They
were
brutes
and
bullies,
without
a
thimble
of
honor
between
them.

Jon
stood
up.
“I’ll
break
the
other
one
for
you
if
you
ask
nicely.”
Grenn
was
sixteen
and
a
head
taller
than
Jon.
All
four
of
them
were
bigger
than
he
was,
but
they
did
not
scare
him.
He’d
beaten
every
one
of
them
in
the
yard.

“Maybe
we’ll
break
you,”
one
of
the
rapers
said.

“Try.”
Jon
reached
back
for
his
sword,
but
one
of
them
grabbed
his
arm
and
twisted
it
behind
his
back.

“You
make
us
look
bad,”
complained
Toad.

“You
looked
bad
before
I
ever
met
you,”
Jon
told
him.
The
boy
who
had
his
arm
jerked
upward
on
him,
hard.
Pain
lanced
through
him,
but
Jon
would
not
cry
out.

Toad
stepped
close.
“The
little
lordling
has
a
mouth
on
him,”
he
said.
He
had
pig
eyes,
small
and
shiny.
“Is
that
your
mommy’s
mouth,
bastard?
What
was
she,
some
whore?
Tell
us
her
name.
Maybe
I
had
her
a
time
or
two.”
He
laughed.

Jon
twisted
like
an
eel
and
slammed
a
heel
down
across
the
instep
of
the
boy
holding
him.
There
was
a
sudden
cry
of
pain,
and
he
was
free.
He
flew
at
Toad,
knocked
him
backward
over
a
bench,
and
landed
on
his
chest
with
both
hands
on
his
throat,
slamming
his
head
against
the
packed
earth.

The
two
from
the
Fingers
pulled
him
off,
throwing
him
roughly
to
the
ground.
Grenn
began
to
kick
at
him.
Jon
was
rolling
away
from
the
blows
when
a
booming
voice
cut
through
the
gloom
of
the
armory.
“STOP
THIS!
NOW!”

Jon
pulled
himself
to
his
feet.
Donal
Noye
stood
glowering
at
them.
“The
yard
is
for
fighting,”
the
armorer
said.
“Keep
your
quarrels
out
of
my
armory,
or
I’ll
make
them
my
quarrels.
You
won’t
like
that.”

Toad
sat
on
the
floor,
gingerly
feeling
the
back
of
his
head.
His
fingers
came
away
bloody.
“He
tried
to
kill
me.”

“’S
true.
I
saw
it,”
one
of
the
rapers
put
in.

“He
broke
my
wrist,”
Grenn
said
again,
holding
it
out
to
Noye
for
inspection.

The
armorer
gave
the
offered
wrist
the
briefest
of
glances.
“A
bruise.
Perhaps
a
sprain.
Maester
Aemon
will
give
you
a
salve.
Go
with
him,
Todder,
that
head
wants
looking
after.
The
rest
of
you,
return
to
your
cells.
Not
you,
Snow.
You
stay.”

Jon
sat
heavily
on
the
long
wooden
bench
as
the
others
left,
oblivious
to
the
looks
they
gave
him,
the
silent
promises
of
future
retribution.
His
arm
was
throbbing.

“The
Watch
has
need
of
every
man
it
can
get,”
Donal
Noye
said
when
they
were
alone.
“Even
men
like
Toad.
You
won’t
win
any
honors
killing
him.”

Jon’s
anger
flared.
“He
said
my
mother
was—”

“—a
whore.
I
heard
him.
What
of
it?”

“Lord
Eddard
Stark
was
not
a
man
to
sleep
with
whores,”
Jon
said
icily.
“His
honor—”

“—did
not
prevent
him
from
fathering
a
bastard.
Did
it?”

Jon
was
cold
with
rage.
“Can
I
go?”

“You
go
when
I
tell
you
to
go.”

Jon
stared
sullenly
at
the
smoke
rising
from
the
brazier,
until
Noye
took
him
under
the
chin,
thick
fingers
twisting
his
head
around.
“Look
at
me
when
I’m
talking
to
you,
boy.”

Jon
looked.
The
armorer
had
a
chest
like
a
keg
of
ale
and
a
gut
to
match.
His
nose
was
flat
and
broad,
and
he
always
seemed
in
need
of
a
shave.
The
left
sleeve
of
his
black
wool
tunic
was
fastened
at
the
shoulder
with
a
silver
pin
in
the
shape
of
a
longsword.
“Words
won’t
make
your
mother
a
whore.
She
was
what
she
was,
and
nothing
Toad
says
can
change
that.
You
know,
we
have
men
on
the
Wall
whose
mothers
were
whores.”

Not
my
mother,
Jon
thought
stubbornly.
He
knew
nothing
of
his
mother;
Eddard
Stark
would
not
talk
of
her.
Yet
he
dreamed
of
her
at
times,
so
often
that
he
could
almost
see
her
face.
In
his
dreams,
she
was
beautiful,
and
highborn,
and
her
eyes
were
kind.

“You
think
you
had
it
hard,
being
a
high
lord’s
bastard?”
the
armorer
went
on.
“That
boy
Jeren
is
a
septon’s
get,
and
Cotter
Pyke
is
the
baseborn
son
of
a
tavern
wench.
Now
he
commands
Eastwatch
by
the
Sea.”

“I
don’t
care,”
Jon
said.
“I
don’t
care
about
them
and
I
don’t
care
about
you
or
Thorne
or
Benjen
Stark
or
any
of
it.
I
hate
it
here.
It’s
too…
it’s
cold.”

“Yes.
Cold
and
hard
and
mean,
that’s
the
Wall,
and
the
men
who
walk
it.
Not
like
the
stories
your
wet
nurse
told
you.
Well,
piss
on
the
stories
and
piss
on
your
wet
nurse.
This
is
the
way
it
is,
and
you’re
here
for
life,
same
as
the
rest
of
us.”

“Life,”
Jon
repeated
bitterly.
The
armorer
could
talk
about
life.
He’d
had
one.
He’d
only
taken
the
black
after
he’d
lost
an
arm
at
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End.
Before
that
he’d
smithed
for
Stannis
Baratheon,
the
king’s
brother.
He’d
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms
from
one
end
to
the
other;
he’d
feasted
and
wenched
and
fought
in
a
hundred
battles.
They
said
it
was
Donal
Noye
who’d
forged
King
Robert’s
warhammer,
the
one
that
crushed
the
life
from
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident.
He’d
done
all
the
things
that
Jon
would
never
do,
and
then
when
he
was
old,
well
past
thirty,
he’d
taken
a
glancing
blow
from
an
axe
and
the
wound
had
festered
until
the
whole
arm
had
to
come
off.
Only
then,
crippled,
had
Donal
Noye
come
to
the
Wall,
when
his
life
was
all
but
over.

“Yes,
life,”
Noye
said.
“A
long
life
or
a
short
one,
it’s
up
to
you,
Snow.
The
road
you’re
walking,
one
of
your
brothers
will
slit
your
throat
for
you
one
night.”

“They’re
not
my
brothers,”
Jon
snapped.
“They
hate
me
because
I’m
better
than
they
are.”

“No.
They
hate
you
because
you
act
like
you’re
better
than
they
are.
They
look
at
you
and
see
a
castle-bred
bastard
who
thinks
he’s
a
lordling.”
The
armorer
leaned
close.
“You’re
no
lordling.
Remember
that.
You’re
a
Snow,
not
a
Stark.
You’re
a
bastard
and
a
bully.”

“A
bully?”
Jon
almost
choked
on
the
word.
The
accusation
was
so
unjust
it
took
his
breath
away.
“They
were
the
ones
who
came
after
me.
Four
of
them.”

“Four
that
you’ve
humiliated
in
the
yard.
Four
who
are
probably
afraid
of
you.
I’ve
watched
you
fight.
It’s
not
training
with
you.
Put
a
good
edge
on
your
sword,
and
they’d
be
dead
meat;
you
know
it,
I
know
it,
they
know
it.
You
leave
them
nothing.
You
shame
them.
Does
that
make
you
proud?”

Jon
hesitated.
He
did
feel
proud
when
he
won.
Why
shouldn’t
he?
But
the
armorer
was
taking
that
away
too,
making
it
sound
as
if
he
were
doing
something
wrong.
“They’re
all
older
than
me,”
he
said
defensively.

“Older
and
bigger
and
stronger,
that’s
the
truth.
I’ll
wager
your
master-at-arms
taught
you
how
to
fight
bigger
men
at
Winterfell,
though.
Who
was
he,
some
old
knight?”

“Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,”
Jon
said
warily.
There
was
a
trap
here.
He
felt
it
closing
around
him.

Donal
Noye
leaned
forward,
into
Jon’s
face.
“Now
think
on
this,
boy.
None
of
these
others
have
ever
had
a
master-at-arms
until
Ser
Alliser.
Their
fathers
were
farmers
and
wagonmen
and
poachers,
smiths
and
miners
and
oars
on
a
trading
galley.
What
they
know
of
fighting
they
learned
between
decks,
in
the
alleys
of
Oldtown
and
Lannisport,
in
wayside
brothels
and
taverns
on
the
kingsroad.
They
may
have
clacked
a
few
sticks
together
before
they
came
here,
but
I
promise
you,
not
one
in
twenty
was
ever
rich
enough
to
own
a
real
sword.”
His
look
was
grim.
“So
how
do
you
like
the
taste
of
your
victories
now,
Lord
Snow?”

“Don’t
call
me
that!”
Jon
said
sharply,
but
the
force
had
gone
out
of
his
anger.
Suddenly
he
felt
ashamed
and
guilty.
“I
never…
I
didn’t
think…”

“Best
you
start
thinking,”
Noye
warned
him.
“That,
or
sleep
with
a
dagger
by
your
bed.
Now
go.”

By
the
time
Jon
left
the
armory,
it
was
almost
midday.
The
sun
had
broken
through
the
clouds.
He
turned
his
back
on
it
and
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
Wall,
blazing
blue
and
crystalline
in
the
sunlight.
Even
after
all
these
weeks,
the
sight
of
it
still
gave
him
the
shivers.
Centuries
of
windblown
dirt
had
pocked
and
scoured
it,
covering
it
like
a
film,
and
it
often
seemed
a
pale
grey,
the
color
of
an
overcast
sky…
but
when
the
sun
caught
it
fair
on
a
bright
day,
it
shone,
alive
with
light,
a
colossal
blue-white
cliff
that
filled
up
half
the
sky.

The
largest
structure
ever
built
by
the
hands
of
man,
Benjen
Stark
had
told
Jon
on
the
kingsroad
when
they
had
first
caught
sight
of
the
Wall
in
the
distance.
“And
beyond
a
doubt
the
most
useless,”
Tyrion
Lannister
had
added
with
a
grin,
but
even
the
Imp
grew
silent
as
they
rode
closer.
You
could
see
it
from
miles
off,
a
pale
blue
line
across
the
northern
horizon,
stretching
away
to
the
east
and
west
and
vanishing
in
the
far
distance,
immense
and
unbroken.
This
is
the
end
of
the
world,
it
seemed
to
say.

When
they
finally
spied
Castle
Black,
its
timbered
keeps
and
stone
towers
looked
like
nothing
more
than
a
handful
of
toy
blocks
scattered
on
the
snow,
beneath
the
vast
wall
of
ice.
The
ancient
stronghold
of
the
black
brothers
was
no
Winterfell,
no
true
castle
at
all.
Lacking
walls,
it
could
not
be
defended,
not
from
the
south,
or
east,
or
west;
but
it
was
only
the
north
that
concerned
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
to
the
north
loomed
the
Wall.
Almost
seven
hundred
feet
high
it
stood,
three
times
the
height
of
the
tallest
tower
in
the
stronghold
it
sheltered.
His
uncle
said
the
top
was
wide
enough
for
a
dozen
armored
knights
to
ride
abreast.
The
gaunt
outlines
of
huge
catapults
and
monstrous
wooden
cranes
stood
sentry
up
there,
like
the
skeletons
of
great
birds,
and
among
them
walked
men
in
black
as
small
as
ants.

As
he
stood
outside
the
armory
looking
up,
Jon
felt
almost
as
overwhelmed
as
he
had
that
day
on
the
kingsroad,
when
he’d
seen
it
for
the
first
time.
The
Wall
was
like
that.
Sometimes
he
could
almost
forget
that
it
was
there,
the
way
you
forgot
about
the
sky
or
the
earth
underfoot,
but
there
were
other
times
when
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world.
It
was
older
than
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
when
he
stood
beneath
it
and
looked
up,
it
made
Jon
dizzy.
He
could
feel
the
great
weight
of
all
that
ice
pressing
down
on
him,
as
if
it
were
about
to
topple,
and
somehow
Jon
knew
that
if
it
fell,
the
world
fell
with
it.

“Makes
you
wonder
what
lies
beyond,”
a
familiar
voice
said.

Jon
looked
around.
“Lannister.
I
didn’t
see—I
mean,
I
thought
I
was
alone.”

Tyrion
Lannister
was
bundled
in
furs
so
thickly
he
looked
like
a
very
small
bear.
“There’s
much
to
be
said
for
taking
people
unawares.
You
never
know
what
you
might
learn.”

“You
won’t
learn
anything
from
me,”
Jon
told
him.
He
had
seen
little
of
the
dwarf
since
their
journey
ended.
As
the
queen’s
own
brother,
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
an
honored
guest
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
The
Lord
Commander
had
given
him
rooms
in
the
King’s
Tower—so-called,
though
no
king
had
visited
it
for
a
hundred
years—and
Lannister
dined
at
Mormont’s
own
table
and
spent
his
days
riding
the
Wall
and
his
nights
dicing
and
drinking
with
Ser
Alliser
and
Bowen
Marsh
and
the
other
high
officers.

“Oh,
I
learn
things
everywhere
I
go.”
The
little
man
gestured
up
at
the
Wall
with
a
gnarled
black
walking
stick.
“As
I
was
saying…
why
is
it
that
when
one
man
builds
a
wall,
the
next
man
immediately
needs
to
know
what’s
on
the
other
side?”
He
cocked
his
head
and
looked
at
Jon
with
his
curious
mismatched
eyes.
“You
do
want
to
know
what’s
on
the
other
side,
don’t
you?”

“It’s
nothing
special,”
Jon
said.
He
wanted
to
ride
with
Benjen
Stark
on
his
rangings,
deep
into
the
mysteries
of
the
haunted
forest,
wanted
to
fight
Mance
Rayder’s
wildlings
and
ward
the
realm
against
the
Others,
but
it
was
better
not
to
speak
of
the
things
you
wanted.
“The
rangers
say
it’s
just
woods
and
mountains
and
frozen
lakes,
with
lots
of
snow
and
ice.”

“And
the
grumkins
and
the
snarks,”
Tyrion
said.
“Let
us
not
forget
them,
Lord
Snow,
or
else
what’s
that
big
thing
for?”

“Don’t
call
me
Lord
Snow.”

The
dwarf
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Would
you
rather
be
called
the
Imp?
Let
them
see
that
their
words
can
cut
you,
and
you’ll
never
be
free
of
the
mockery.
If
they
want
to
give
you
a
name,
take
it,
make
it
your
own.
Then
they
can’t
hurt
you
with
it
anymore.”
He
gestured
with
his
stick.
“Come,
walk
with
me.
They’ll
be
serving
some
vile
stew
in
the
common
hall
by
now,
and
I
could
do
with
a
bowl
of
something
hot.”

Jon
was
hungry
too,
so
he
fell
in
beside
Lannister
and
slowed
his
pace
to
match
the
dwarf’s
awkward,
waddling
steps.
The
wind
was
rising,
and
they
could
hear
the
old
wooden
buildings
creaking
around
them,
and
in
the
distance
a
heavy
shutter
banging,
over
and
over,
forgotten.
Once
there
was
a
muffled
thump
as
a
blanket
of
snow
slid
from
a
roof
and
landed
near
them.

“I
don’t
see
your
wolf,”
Lannister
said
as
they
walked.

“I
chain
him
up
in
the
old
stables
when
we’re
training.
They
board
all
the
horses
in
the
east
stables
now,
so
no
one
bothers
him.
The
rest
of
the
time
he
stays
with
me.
My
sleeping
cell
is
in
Hardin’s
Tower.”

“That’s
the
one
with
the
broken
battlement,
no?
Shattered
stone
in
the
yard
below,
and
a
lean
to
it
like
our
noble
king
Robert
after
a
long
night’s
drinking?
I
thought
all
those
buildings
had
been
abandoned.”

Jon
shrugged.
“No
one
cares
where
you
sleep.
Most
of
the
old
keeps
are
empty,
you
can
pick
any
cell
you
want.”
Once
Castle
Black
had
housed
five
thousand
fighting
men
with
all
their
horses
and
servants
and
weapons.
Now
it
was
home
to
a
tenth
that
number,
and
parts
of
it
were
falling
into
ruin.

Tyrion
Lannister’s
laughter
steamed
in
the
cold
air.
“I’ll
be
sure
to
tell
your
father
to
arrest
more
stonemasons,
before
your
tower
collapses.”

Jon
could
taste
the
mockery
there,
but
there
was
no
denying
the
truth.
The
Watch
had
built
nineteen
great
strongholds
along
the
Wall,
but
only
three
were
still
occupied:
Eastwatch
on
its
grey
windswept
shore,
the
Shadow
Tower
hard
by
the
mountains
where
the
Wall
ended,
and
Castle
Black
between
them,
at
the
end
of
the
kingsroad.
The
other
keeps,
long
deserted,
were
lonely,
haunted
places,
where
cold
winds
whistled
through
black
windows
and
the
spirits
of
the
dead
manned
the
parapets.

“It’s
better
that
I’m
by
myself,”
Jon
said
stubbornly.
“The
rest
of
them
are
scared
of
Ghost.”

“Wise
boys,”
Lannister
said.
Then
he
changed
the
subject.
“The
talk
is,
your
uncle
is
too
long
away.”

Jon
remembered
the
wish
he’d
wished
in
his
anger,
the
vision
of
Benjen
Stark
dead
in
the
snow,
and
he
looked
away
quickly.
The
dwarf
had
a
way
of
sensing
things,
and
Jon
did
not
want
him
to
see
the
guilt
in
his
eyes.
“He
said
he’d
be
back
by
my
name
day,”
he
admitted.
His
name
day
had
come
and
gone,
unremarked,
a
fortnight
past.
“They
were
looking
for
Ser
Waymar
Royce,
his
father
is
bannerman
to
Lord
Arryn.
Uncle
Benjen
said
they
might
search
as
far
as
the
Shadow
Tower.
That’s
all
the
way
up
in
the
mountains.”

“I
hear
that
a
good
many
rangers
have
vanished
of
late,”
Lannister
said
as
they
mounted
the
steps
to
the
common
hall.
He
grinned
and
pulled
open
the
door.
“Perhaps
the
grumkins
are
hungry
this
year.”

Inside,
the
hall
was
immense
and
drafty,
even
with
a
fire
roaring
in
its
great
hearth.
Crows
nested
in
the
timbers
of
its
lofty
ceiling.
Jon
heard
their
cries
overhead
as
he
accepted
a
bowl
of
stew
and
a
heel
of
black
bread
from
the
day’s
cooks.
Grenn
and
Toad
and
some
of
the
others
were
seated
at
the
bench
nearest
the
warmth,
laughing
and
cursing
each
other
in
rough
voices.
Jon
eyed
them
thoughtfully
for
a
moment.
Then
he
chose
a
spot
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall,
well
away
from
the
other
diners.

Tyrion
Lannister
sat
across
from
him,
sniffing
at
the
stew
suspiciously.
“Barley,
onion,
carrot,”
he
muttered.
“Someone
should
tell
the
cooks
that
turnip
isn’t
a
meat.”

“It’s
mutton
stew.”
Jon
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
warmed
his
hands
in
the
steam
rising
from
the
bowl.
The
smell
made
his
mouth
water.

“Snow.”

Jon
knew
Alliser
Thorne’s
voice,
but
there
was
a
curious
note
in
it
that
he
had
not
heard
before.
He
turned.

“The
Lord
Commander
wants
to
see
you.
Now.”

For
a
moment
Jon
was
too
frightened
to
move.
Why
would
the
Lord
Commander
want
to
see
him?
They
had
heard
something
about
Benjen,
he
thought
wildly,
he
was
dead,
the
vision
had
come
true.
“Is
it
my
uncle?”
he
blurted.
“Is
he
returned
safe?”

“The
Lord
Commander
is
not
accustomed
to
waiting,”
was
Ser
Alliser’s
reply.
“And
I
am
not
accustomed
to
having
my
commands
questioned
by
bastards.”

Tyrion
Lannister
swung
off
the
bench
and
rose.
“Stop
it,
Thorne.
You’re
frightening
the
boy.”

“Keep
out
of
matters
that
don’t
concern
you,
Lannister.
You
have
no
place
here.”

“I
have
a
place
at
court,
though,”
the
dwarf
said,
smiling.
“A
word
in
the
right
ear,
and
you’ll
die
a
sour
old
man
before
you
get
another
boy
to
train.
Now
tell
Snow
why
the
Old
Bear
needs
to
see
him.
Is
there
news
of
his
uncle?”

“No,”
Ser
Alliser
said.
“This
is
another
matter
entirely.
A
bird
arrived
this
morning
from
Winterfell,
with
a
message
that
concerns
his
brother.”
He
corrected
himself.
“His
half
brother.”

“Bran,”
Jon
breathed,
scrambling
to
his
feet.
“Something’s
happened
to
Bran.”

Tyrion
Lannister
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm.
“Jon,”
he
said.
“I
am
truly
sorry.”

Jon
scarcely
heard
him.
He
brushed
off
Tyrion’s
hand
and
strode
across
the
hall.
He
was
running
by
the
time
he
hit
the
doors.
He
raced
to
the
Commander’s
Keep,
dashing
through
drifts
of
old
snow.
When
the
guards
passed
him,
he
took
the
tower
steps
two
at
a
time.
By
the
time
he
burst
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
Commander,
his
boots
were
soaked
and
Jon
was
wild-eyed
and
panting.
“Bran,”
he
said.
“What
does
it
say
about
Bran?”

Jeor
Mormont,
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
was
a
gruff
old
man
with
an
immense
bald
head
and
a
shaggy
grey
beard.
He
had
a
raven
on
his
arm,
and
he
was
feeding
it
kernels
of
corn.
“I
am
told
you
can
read.”
He
shook
the
raven
off,
and
it
flapped
its
wings
and
flew
to
the
window,
where
it
sat
watching
as
Mormont
drew
a
roll
of
paper
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Jon.
“Corn,”
it
muttered
in
a
raucous
voice.
“Corn,
corn.”

Jon’s
finger
traced
the
outline
of
the
direwolf
in
the
white
wax
of
the
broken
seat.
He
recognized
Robb’s
hand,
but
the
letters
seemed
to
blur
and
run
as
he
tried
to
read
them.
He
realized
he
was
crying.
And
then,
through
the
tears,
he
found
the
sense
in
the
words,
and
raised
his
head.
“He
woke
up,”
he
said.
“The
gods
gave
him
back.”

“Crippled,”
Mormont
said.
“I’m
sorry,
boy.
Read
the
rest
of
the
letter.”

He
looked
at
the
words,
but
they
didn’t
matter.
Nothing
mattered.
Bran
was
going
to
live.
“My
brother
is
going
to
live,”
he
told
Mormont.
The
Lord
Commander
shook
his
head,
gathered
up
a
fistful
of
corn,
and
whistled.
The
raven
flew
to
his
shoulder,
crying,
“Live!
Live!”

Jon
ran
down
the
stairs,
a
smile
on
his
face
and
Robb’s
letter
in
his
hand.
“My
brother
is
going
to
live,”
he
told
the
guards.
They
exchanged
a
look.
He
ran
back
to
the
common
hall,
where
he
found
Tyrion
Lannister
just
finishing
his
meal.
He
grabbed
the
little
man
under
the
arms,
hoisted
him
up
in
the
air,
and
spun
him
around
in
a
circle.
“Bran
is
going
to
live!”
he
whooped.
Lannister
looked
startled.
Jon
put
him
down
and
thrust
the
paper
into
his
hands.
“Here,
read
it,”
he
said.

Others
were
gathering
around
and
looking
at
him
curiously.
Jon
noticed
Grenn
a
few
feet
away.
A
thick
woolen
bandage
was
wrapped
around
one
hand.
He
looked
anxious
and
uncomfortable,
not
menacing
at
all.
Jon
went
to
him.
Grenn
edged
backward
and
put
up
his
hands.
“Stay
away
from
me
now,
you
bastard.”

Jon
smiled
at
him.
“I’m
sorry
about
your
wrist.
Robb
used
the
same
move
on
me
once,
only
with
a
wooden
blade.
It
hurt
like
seven
hells,
but
yours
must
be
worse.
Look,
if
you
want,
I
can
show
you
how
to
defend
that.”

Alliser
Thorne
overheard
him.
“Lord
Snow
wants
to
take
my
place
now.”
He
sneered.
“I’d
have
an
easier
time
teaching
a
wolf
to
juggle
than
you
will
training
this
aurochs.”

“I’ll
take
that
wager,
Ser
Alliser,”
Jon
said.
“I’d
love
to
see
Ghost
juggle.”

Jon
heard
Grenn
suck
in
his
breath,
shocked.
Silence
fell.

Then
Tyrion
Lannister
guffawed.
Three
of
the
black
brothers
joined
in
from
a
nearby
table.
The
laughter
spread
up
and
down
the
benches,
until
even
the
cooks
joined
in.
The
birds
stirred
in
the
rafters,
and
finally
even
Grenn
began
to
chuckle.

Ser
Alliser
never
took
his
eyes
from
Jon.
As
the
laughter
rolled
around
him,
his
face
darkened,
and
his
sword
hand
curled
into
a
fist.
“That
was
a
grievous
error,
Lord
Snow,”
he
said
at
last
in
the
acid
tones
of
an
enemy.





EDDARD

Eddard
Stark
rode
through
the
towering
bronze
doors
of
the
Red
Keep
sore,
tired,
hungry,
and
irritable.
He
was
still
ahorse,
dreaming
of
a
long
hot
soak,
a
roast
fowl,
and
a
featherbed,
when
the
king’s
steward
told
him
that
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
convened
an
urgent
meeting
of
the
small
council.
The
honor
of
the
Hand’s
presence
was
requested
as
soon
as
it
was
convenient.
“It
will
be
convenient
on
the
morrow,”
Ned
snapped
as
he
dismounted.

The
steward
bowed
very
low.
“I
shall
give
the
councillors
your
regrets,
my
lord.”

“No,
damn
it,”
Ned
said.
It
would
not
do
to
offend
the
council
before
he
had
even
begun.
“I
will
see
them.
Pray
give
me
a
few
moments
to
change
into
something
more
presentable.”

“Yes,
my
lord,”
the
steward
said.
“We
have
given
you
Lord
Arryn’s
former
chambers
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
if
it
please
you.
I
shall
have
your
things
taken
there.”

“My
thanks,”
Ned
said
as
he
ripped
off
his
riding
gloves
and
tucked
them
into
his
belt.
The
rest
of
his
household
was
coming
through
the
gate
behind
him.
Ned
saw
Vayon
Poole,
his
own
steward,
and
called
out.
“It
seems
the
council
has
urgent
need
of
me.
See
that
my
daughters
find
their
bedchambers,
and
tell
Jory
to
keep
them
there.
Arya
is
not
to
go
exploring.”
Poole
bowed.
Ned
turned
back
to
the
royal
steward.
“My
wagons
are
still
straggling
through
the
city.
I
shall
need
appropriate
garments.”

“It
will
be
my
great
pleasure,”
the
steward
said.

And
so
Ned
had
come
striding
into
the
council
chambers,
bone-tired
and
dressed
in
borrowed
clothing,
to
find
four
members
of
the
small
council
waiting
for
him.

The
chamber
was
richly
furnished.
Myrish
carpets
covered
the
floor
instead
of
rushes,
and
in
one
corner
a
hundred
fabulous
beasts
cavorted
in
bright
paints
on
a
carved
screen
from
the
Summer
Isles.
The
walls
were
hung
with
tapestries
from
Norvos
and
Qohor
and
Lys,
and
a
pair
of
Valyrian
sphinxes
flanked
the
door,
eyes
of
polished
garnet
smoldering
in
black
marble
faces.

The
councillor
Ned
liked
least,
the
eunuch
Varys,
accosted
him
the
moment
he
entered.
“Lord
Stark,
I
was
grievous
sad
to
hear
about
your
troubles
on
the
kingsroad.
We
have
all
been
visiting
the
sept
to
light
candles
for
Prince
Joffrey.
I
pray
for
his
recovery.”
His
hand
left
powder
stains
on
Ned’s
sleeve,
and
he
smelled
as
foul
and
sweet
as
flowers
on
a
grave.

“Your
gods
have
heard
you,”
Ned
replied,
cool
yet
polite.
“The
prince
grows
stronger
every
day.”
He
disentangled
himself
from
the
eunuch’s
grip
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
Lord
Renly
stood
by
the
screen,
talking
quietly
with
a
short
man
who
could
only
be
Littlefinger.
Renly
had
been
a
boy
of
eight
when
Robert
won
the
throne,
but
he
had
grown
into
a
man
so
like
his
brother
that
Ned
found
it
disconcerting.
Whenever
he
saw
him,
it
was
as
if
the
years
had
slipped
away
and
Robert
stood
before
him,
fresh
from
his
victory
on
the
Trident.

“I
see
you
have
arrived
safely,
Lord
Stark,”
Renly
said.

“And
you
as
well,”
Ned
replied.
“You
must
forgive
me,
but
sometimes
you
look
the
very
image
of
your
brother
Robert.”

“A
poor
copy,”
Renly
said
with
a
shrug.

“Though
much
better
dressed,”
Littlefinger
quipped.
“Lord
Renly
spends
more
on
clothing
than
half
the
ladies
of
the
court.”

It
was
true
enough.
Lord
Renly
was
in
dark
green
velvet,
with
a
dozen
golden
stags
embroidered
on
his
doublet.
A
cloth-of-gold
half
cape
was
draped
casually
across
one
shoulder,
fastened
with
an
emerald
brooch.
“There
are
worse
crimes,”
Renly
said
with
a
laugh.
“The
way
you
dress,
for
one.”

Littlefinger
ignored
the
jibe.
He
eyed
Ned
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
bordered
on
insolence.
“I
have
hoped
to
meet
you
for
some
years,
Lord
Stark.
No
doubt
Lady
Catelyn
has
mentioned
me
to
you.”

“She
has,”
Ned
replied
with
a
chill
in
his
voice.
The
sly
arrogance
of
the
comment
rankled
him.
“I
understand
you
knew
my
brother
Brandon
as
well.”

Renly
Baratheon
laughed.
Varys
shuffled
over
to
listen.

“Rather
too
well,”
Littlefinger
said.
“I
still
carry
a
token
of
his
esteem.
Did
Brandon
speak
of
me
too?”

“Often,
and
with
some
heat,”
Ned
said,
hoping
that
would
end
it.
He
had
no
patience
with
this
game
they
played,
this
dueling
with
words.

“I
should
have
thought
that
heat
ill
suits
you
Starks,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Here
in
the
south,
they
say
you
are
all
made
of
ice,
and
melt
when
you
ride
below
the
Neck.”

“I
do
not
plan
on
melting
soon,
Lord
Baelish.
You
may
count
on
it.”
Ned
moved
to
the
council
table
and
said,
“Maester
Pycelle,
I
trust
you
are
well.”

The
Grand
Maester
smiled
gently
from
his
tall
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table.
“Well
enough
for
a
man
of
my
years,
my
lord,”
he
replied,
“yet
I
do
tire
easily,
I
fear.”
Wispy
strands
of
white
hair
fringed
the
broad
bald
dome
of
his
forehead
above
a
kindly
face.
His
maester’s
collar
was
no
simple
metal
choker
such
as
Luwin
wore,
but
two
dozen
heavy
chains
wound
together
into
a
ponderous
metal
necklace
that
covered
him
from
throat
to
breast.
The
links
were
forged
of
every
metal
known
to
man:
black
iron
and
red
gold,
bright
copper
and
dull
lead,
steel
and
tin
and
pale
silver,
brass
and
bronze
and
platinum.
Garnets
and
amethysts
and
black
pearls
adorned
the
metalwork,
and
here
and
there
an
emerald
or
ruby.
“Perhaps
we
might
begin
soon,”
the
Grand
Maester
said,
hands
knitting
together
atop
his
broad
stomach.
“I
fear
I
shall
fall
asleep
if
we
wait
much
longer.”

“As
you
will.”
The
king’s
seat
sat
empty
at
the
head
of
the
table,
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
embroidered
in
gold
thread
on
its
pillows.
Ned
took
the
chair
beside
it,
as
the
right
hand
of
his
king.
“My
lords,”
he
said
formally,
“I
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting.”

“You
are
the
King’s
Hand,”
Varys
said.
“We
serve
at
your
pleasure,
Lord
Stark.”

As
the
others
took
their
accustomed
seats,
it
struck
Eddard
Stark
forcefully
that
he
did
not
belong
here,
in
this
room,
with
these
men.
He
remembered
what
Robert
had
told
him
in
the
crypts
below
Winterfell.
I
am
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
fools,
the
king
had
insisted.
Ned
looked
down
the
council
table
and
wondered
which
were
the
flatterers
and
which
the
fools.
He
thought
he
knew
already.
“We
are
but
five,”
he
pointed
out.

“Lord
Stannis
took
himself
to
Dragonstone
not
long
after
the
king
went
north,”
Varys
said,
“and
our
gallant
Ser
Barristan
no
doubt
rides
beside
the
king
as
he
makes
his
way
through
the
city,
as
befits
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Perhaps
we
had
best
wait
for
Ser
Barristan
and
the
king
to
join
us,”
Ned
suggested.

Renly
Baratheon
laughed
aloud.
“If
we
wait
for
my
brother
to
grace
us
with
his
royal
presence,
it
could
be
a
long
sit.”

“Our
good
King
Robert
has
many
cares,”
Varys
said.
“He
entrusts
some
small
matters
to
us,
to
lighten
his
load.”

“What
Lord
Varys
means
is
that
all
this
business
of
coin
and
crops
and
justice
bores
my
royal
brother
to
tears,”
Lord
Renly
said,
“so
it
falls
to
us
to
govern
the
realm.
He
does
send
us
a
command
from
time
to
time.”
He
drew
a
tightly
rolled
paper
from
his
sleeve
and
laid
it
on
the
table.
“This
morning
he
commanded
me
to
ride
ahead
with
all
haste
and
ask
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
convene
this
council
at
once.
He
has
an
urgent
task
for
us.”

Littlefinger
smiled
and
handed
the
paper
to
Ned.
It
bore
the
royal
seal.
Ned
broke
the
wax
with
his
thumb
and
flattened
the
letter
to
consider
the
king’s
urgent
command,
reading
the
words
with
mounting
disbelief.
Was
there
no
end
to
Robert’s
folly?
And
to
do
this
in
his
name,
that
was
salt
in
the
wound.
“Gods
be
good,”
he
swore.

“What
Lord
Eddard
means
to
say,”
Lord
Renly
announced,
“is
that
His
Grace
instructs
us
to
stage
a
great
tournament
in
honor
of
his
appointment
as
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

“How
much?”
asked
Littlefinger,
mildly.

Ned
read
the
answer
off
the
letter.
“Forty
thousand
golden
dragons
to
the
champion.
Twenty
thousand
to
the
man
who
comes
second,
another
twenty
to
the
winner
of
the
melee,
and
ten
thousand
to
the
victor
of
the
archery
competition.”

“Ninety
thousand
gold
pieces,”
Littlefinger
sighed.
“And
we
must
not
neglect
the
other
costs.
Robert
will
want
a
prodigious
feast.
That
means
cooks,
carpenters,
serving
girls,
singers,
jugglers,
fools…”

“Fools
we
have
in
plenty,”
Lord
Renly
said.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
looked
to
Littlefinger
and
asked,
“Will
the
treasury
bear
the
expense?”

“What
treasury
is
that?”
Littlefinger
replied
with
a
twist
of
his
mouth.
“Spare
me
the
foolishness,
Maester.
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
the
treasury
has
been
empty
for
years.
I
shall
have
to
borrow
the
money.
No
doubt
the
Lannisters
will
be
accommodating.
We
owe
Lord
Tywin
some
three
million
dragons
at
present,
what
matter
another
hundred
thousand?”

Ned
was
stunned.
“Are
you
claiming
that
the
Crown
is
three
million
gold
pieces
in
debt?”

“The
Crown
is
more
than
six
million
gold
pieces
in
debt,
Lord
Stark.
The
Lannisters
are
the
biggest
part
of
it,
but
we
have
also
borrowed
from
Lord
Tyrell,
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos,
and
several
Tyroshi
trading
cartels.
Of
late
I’ve
had
to
turn
to
the
Faith.
The
High
Septon
haggles
worse
than
a
Dornish
fishmonger.”

Ned
was
aghast.
“Aerys
Targaryen
left
a
treasury
flowing
with
gold.
How
could
you
let
this
happen?”

Littlefinger
gave
a
shrug.
“The
master
of
coin
finds
the
money.
The
king
and
the
Hand
spend
it.”

“I
will
not
believe
that
Jon
Arryn
allowed
Robert
to
beggar
the
realm,”
Ned
said
hotly.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
shook
his
great
bald
head,
his
chains
clinking
softly.
“Lord
Arryn
was
a
prudent
man,
but
I
fear
that
His
Grace
does
not
always
listen
to
wise
counsel.”

“My
royal
brother
loves
tournaments
and
feasts,”
Renly
Baratheon
said,
“and
he
loathes
what
he
calls
‘counting
coppers.’”

“I
will
speak
with
His
Grace,”
Ned
said.
“This
tourney
is
an
extravagance
the
realm
cannot
afford.”

“Speak
to
him
as
you
will,”
Lord
Renly
said,
“we
had
still
best
make
our
plans.”

“Another
day,”
Ned
said.
Perhaps
too
sharply,
from
the
looks
they
gave
him.
He
would
have
to
remember
that
he
was
no
longer
in
Winterfell,
where
only
the
king
stood
higher;
here,
he
was
but
first
among
equals.
“Forgive
me,
my
lords,”
he
said
in
a
softer
tone.
“I
am
tired.
Let
us
call
a
halt
for
today
and
resume
when
we
are
fresher.”
He
did
not
ask
for
their
consent,
but
stood
abruptly,
nodded
at
them
all,
and
made
for
the
door.

Outside,
wagons
and
riders
were
still
pouring
through
the
castle
gates,
and
the
yard
was
a
chaos
of
mud
and
horseflesh
and
shouting
men.
The
king
had
not
yet
arrived,
he
was
told.
Since
the
ugliness
on
the
Trident,
the
Starks
and
their
household
had
ridden
well
ahead
of
the
main
column,
the
better
to
separate
themselves
from
the
Lannisters
and
the
growing
tension.
Robert
had
hardly
been
seen;
the
talk
was
he
was
traveling
in
the
huge
wheelhouse,
drunk
as
often
as
not.
If
so,
he
might
be
hours
behind,
but
he
would
still
be
here
too
soon
for
Ned’s
liking.
He
had
only
to
look
at
Sansa’s
face
to
feel
the
rage
twisting
inside
him
once
again.
The
last
fortnight
of
their
journey
had
been
a
misery.
Sansa
blamed
Arya
and
told
her
that
it
should
have
been
Nymeria
who
died.
And
Arya
was
lost
after
she
heard
what
had
happened
to
her
butcher’s
boy.
Sansa
cried
herself
to
sleep,
Arya
brooded
silently
all
day
long,
and
Eddard
Stark
dreamed
of
a
frozen
hell
reserved
for
the
Starks
of
Winterfell.

He
crossed
the
outer
yard,
passed
under
a
portcullis
into
the
inner
bailey,
and
was
walking
toward
what
he
thought
was
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
when
Littlefinger
appeared
in
front
of
him.
“You’re
going
the
wrong
way,
Stark.
Come
with
me.”

Hesitantly,
Ned
followed.
Littlefinger
led
him
into
a
tower,
down
a
stair,
across
a
small
sunken
courtyard,
and
along
a
deserted
corridor
where
empty
suits
of
armor
stood
sentinel
along
the
walls.
They
were
relics
of
the
Targaryens,
black
steel
with
dragon
scales
cresting
their
helms,
now
dusty
and
forgotten.
“This
is
not
the
way
to
my
chambers,”
Ned
said.

“Did
I
say
it
was?
I’m
leading
you
to
the
dungeons
to
slit
your
throat
and
seal
your
corpse
up
behind
a
wall,”
Littlefinger
replied,
his
voice
dripping
with
sarcasm.
“We
have
no
time
for
this,
Stark.
Your
wife
awaits.”

“What
game
are
you
playing,
Littlefinger?
Catelyn
is
at
Winterfell,
hundreds
of
leagues
from
here.”

“Oh?”
Littlefinger’s
grey-green
eyes
glittered
with
amusement.
“Then
it
appears
someone
has
managed
an
astonishing
impersonation.
For
the
last
time,
come.
Or
don’t
come,
and
I’ll
keep
her
for
myself.”
He
hurried
down
the
steps.

Ned
followed
him
warily,
wondering
if
this
day
would
ever
end.
He
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues,
but
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
they
were
meat
and
mead
to
a
man
like
Littlefinger.

At
the
foot
of
the
steps
was
a
heavy
door
of
oak
and
iron.
Petyr
Baelish
lifted
the
crossbar
and
gestured
Ned
through.
They
stepped
out
into
the
ruddy
glow
of
dusk,
on
a
rocky
bluff
high
above
the
river.
“We’re
outside
the
castle,”
Ned
said.

“You
are
a
hard
man
to
fool,
Stark,”
Littlefinger
said
with
a
smirk.
“Was
it
the
sun
that
gave
it
away,
or
the
sky?
Follow
me.
There
are
niches
cut
in
the
rock.
Try
not
to
fall
to
your
death,
Catelyn
would
never
understand.”
With
that,
he
was
over
the
side
of
the
cliff,
descending
as
quick
as
a
monkey.

Ned
studied
the
rocky
face
of
the
bluff
for
a
moment,
then
followed
more
slowly.
The
niches
were
there,
as
Littlefinger
had
promised,
shallow
cuts
that
would
be
invisible
from
below,
unless
you
knew
just
where
to
look
for
them.
The
river
was
a
long,
dizzying
distance
below.
Ned
kept
his
face
pressed
to
the
rock
and
tried
not
to
look
down
any
more
often
than
he
had
to.

When
at
last
he
reached
the
bottom,
a
narrow,
muddy
trail
along
the
water’s
edge,
Littlefinger
was
lazing
against
a
rock
and
eating
an
apple.
He
was
almost
down
to
the
core.
“You
are
growing
old
and
slow,
Stark,”
he
said,
flipping
the
apple
casually
into
the
rushing
water.
“No
matter,
we
ride
the
rest
of
the
way.”
He
had
two
horses
waiting.
Ned
mounted
up
and
trotted
behind
him,
down
the
trail
and
into
the
city.

Finally
Baelish
drew
rein
in
front
of
a
ramshackle
building,
three
stories,
timbered,
its
windows
bright
with
lamplight
in
the
gathering
dusk.
The
sounds
of
music
and
raucous
laughter
drifted
out
and
floated
over
the
water.
Beside
the
door
swung
an
ornate
oil
lamp
on
a
heavy
chain,
with
a
globe
of
leaded
red
glass.

Ned
Stark
dismounted
in
a
fury.
“A
brothel,”
he
said
as
he
seized
Littlefinger
by
the
shoulder
and
spun
him
around.
“You’ve
brought
me
all
this
way
to
take
me
to
a
brothel.”

“Your
wife
is
inside,”
Littlefinger
said.

It
was
the
final
insult.
“Brandon
was
too
kind
to
you,”
Ned
said
as
he
slammed
the
small
man
back
against
a
wall
and
shoved
his
dagger
up
under
the
little
pointed
chin
beard.

“My
lord,
no,”
an
urgent
voice
called
out.
“He
speaks
the
truth.”
There
were
footsteps
behind
him.

Ned
spun,
knife
in
hand,
as
an
old
white-haired
man
hurried
toward
them.
He
was
dressed
in
brown
roughspun,
and
the
soft
flesh
under
his
chin
wobbled
as
he
ran.
“This
is
no
business
of
yours,”
Ned
began;
then,
suddenly,
the
recognition
came.
He
lowered
the
dagger,
astonished.
“Ser
Rodrik?”

Rodrik
Cassel
nodded.
“Your
lady
awaits
you
upstairs.”

Ned
was
lost.
“Catelyn
is
truly
here?
This
is
not
some
strange
jape
of
Littlefinger’s?”
He
sheathed
his
blade.

“Would
that
it
were,
Stark,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Follow
me,
and
try
to
look
a
shade
more
lecherous
and
a
shade
less
like
the
King’s
Hand.
It
would
not
do
to
have
you
recognized.
Perhaps
you
could
fondle
a
breast
or
two,
just
in
passing.”

They
went
inside,
through
a
crowded
common
room
where
a
fat
woman
was
singing
bawdy
songs
while
pretty
young
girls
in
linen
shifts
and
wisps
of
colored
silk
pressed
themselves
against
their
lovers
and
dandled
on
their
laps.
No
one
paid
Ned
the
least
bit
of
attention.
Ser
Rodrik
waited
below
while
Littlefinger
led
him
up
to
the
third
floor,
along
a
corridor,
and
through
a
door.

Inside,
Catelyn
was
waiting.
She
cried
out
when
she
saw
him,
ran
to
him,
and
embraced
him
fiercely.

“My
lady,”
Ned
whispered
in
wonderment.

“Oh,
very
good,”
said
Littlefinger,
closing
the
door.
“You
recognized
her.”

“I
feared
you’d
never
come,
my
lord,”
she
whispered
against
his
chest.
“Petyr
has
been
bringing
me
reports.
He
told
me
of
your
troubles
with
Arya
and
the
young
prince.
How
are
my
girls?”

“Both
in
mourning,
and
full
of
anger,”
he
told
her.
“Cat,
I
do
not
understand.
What
are
you
doing
in
King’s
Landing?
What’s
happened?”
Ned
asked
his
wife.
“Is
it
Bran?
Is
he…”Dead
was
the
word
that
came
to
his
lips,
but
he
could
not
say
it.

“It
is
Bran,
but
not
as
you
think,”
Catelyn
said.

Ned
was
lost.
“Then
how?
Why
are
you
here,
my
love?
What
is
this
place?”

“Just
what
it
appears,”
Littlefinger
said,
easing
himself
onto
a
window
seat.
“A
brothel.
Can
you
think
of
a
less
likely
place
to
find
a
Catelyn
Tully?”
He
smiled.
“As
it
chances,
I
own
this
particular
establishment,
so
arrangements
were
easily
made.
I
am
most
anxious
to
keep
the
Lannisters
from
learning
that
Cat
is
here
in
King’s
Landing.”

“Why?”
Ned
asked.
He
saw
her
hands
then,
the
awkward
way
she
held
them,
the
raw
red
scars,
the
stiffness
of
the
last
two
fingers
on
her
left.
“You’ve
been
hurt.”
He
took
her
hands
in
his
own,
turned
them
over.
“Gods.
Those
are
deep
cuts…
a
gash
from
a
sword
or…
how
did
this
happen,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
slid
a
dagger
out
from
under
her
cloak
and
placed
it
in
his
hand.
“This
blade
was
sent
to
open
Bran’s
throat
and
spill
his
life’s
blood.”

Ned’s
head
jerked
up.
“But…
who…
why
would…”

She
put
a
finger
to
his
lips.
“Let
me
tell
it
all,
my
love.
It
will
go
faster
that
way.
Listen.”

So
he
listened,
and
she
told
it
all,
from
the
fire
in
the
library
tower
to
Varys
and
the
guardsmen
and
Littlefinger.
And
when
she
was
done,
Eddard
Stark
sat
dazed
beside
the
table,
the
dagger
in
his
hand.
Bran’s
wolf
had
saved
the
boy’s
life,
he
thought
dully.
What
was
it
that
Jon
had
said
when
they
found
the
pups
in
the
snow?
Your
children
were
meant
to
have
these
pups,
my
lord.
And
he
had
killed
Sansa’s,
and
for
what?
Was
it
guilt
he
was
feeling?
Or
fear?
If
the
gods
had
sent
these
wolves,
what
folly
had
he
done?

Painfully,
Ned
forced
his
thoughts
back
to
the
dagger
and
what
it
meant.
“The
Imp’s
dagger,”
he
repeated.
It
made
no
sense.
His
hand
curled
around
the
smooth
dragonbone
hilt,
and
he
slammed
the
blade
into
the
table,
felt
it
bite
into
the
wood.
It
stood
mocking
him.
“Why
should
Tyrion
Lannister
want
Bran
dead?
The
boy
has
never
done
him
harm.”

“Do
you
Starks
have
nought
but
snow
between
your
ears?”
Littlefinger
asked.
“The
Imp
would
never
have
acted
alone.”

Ned
rose
and
paced
the
length
of
the
room.
“If
the
queen
had
a
role
in
this
or,
gods
forbid,
the
king
himself…
no,
I
will
not
believe
that.”
Yet
even
as
he
said
the
words,
he
remembered
that
chill
morning
on
the
barrowlands,
and
Robert’s
talk
of
sending
hired
knives
after
the
Targaryen
princess.
He
remembered
Rhaegar’s
infant
son,
the
red
ruin
of
his
skull,
and
the
way
the
king
had
turned
away,
as
he
had
turned
away
in
Darry’s
audience
hall
not
so
long
ago.
He
could
still
hear
Sansa
pleading,
as
Lyanna
had
pleaded
once.

“Most
likely
the
king
did
not
know,”
Littlefinger
said.
“It
would
not
be
the
first
time.
Our
good
Robert
is
practiced
at
closing
his
eyes
to
things
he
would
rather
not
see.”

Ned
had
no
reply
for
that.
The
face
of
the
butcher’s
boy
swam
up
before
his
eyes,
cloven
almost
in
two,
and
afterward
the
king
had
said
not
a
word.
His
head
was
pounding.

Littlefinger
sauntered
over
to
the
table,
wrenched
the
knife
from
the
wood.
“The
accusation
is
treason
either
way.
Accuse
the
king
and
you
will
dance
with
Ilyn
Payne
before
the
words
are
out
of
your
mouth.
The
queen…
if
you
can
find
proof,
and
if
you
can
make
Robert
listen,
then
perhaps…”

“We
have
proof,”
Ned
said.
“We
have
the
dagger.”

“This?”
Littlefinger
flipped
the
knife
casually
end
over
end.
“A
sweet
piece
of
steel,
but
it
cuts
two
ways,
my
lord.
The
Imp
will
no
doubt
swear
the
blade
was
lost
or
stolen
while
he
was
at
Winterfell,
and
with
his
hireling
dead,
who
is
there
to
give
him
the
lie?”
He
tossed
the
knife
lightly
to
Ned.
“My
counsel
is
to
drop
that
in
the
river
and
forget
that
it
was
ever
forged.”

Ned
regarded
him
coldly.
“Lord
Baelish,
I
am
a
Stark
of
Winterfell.
My
son
lies
crippled,
perhaps
dying.
He
would
be
dead,
and
Catelyn
with
him,
but
for
a
wolf
pup
we
found
in
the
snow.
If
you
truly
believe
I
could
forget
that,
you
are
as
big
a
fool
now
as
when
you
took
up
sword
against
my
brother.”

“A
fool
I
may
be,
Stark…
yet
I’m
still
here,
while
your
brother
has
been
moldering
in
his
frozen
grave
for
some
fourteen
years
now.
If
you
are
so
eager
to
molder
beside
him,
far
be
it
from
me
to
dissuade
you,
but
I
would
rather
not
be
included
in
the
party,
thank
you
very
much.”

“You
would
be
the
last
man
I
would
willingly
include
in
any
party,
Lord
Baelish.”

“You
wound
me
deeply.”
Littlefinger
placed
a
hand
over
his
heart.
“For
my
part,
I
always
found
you
Starks
a
tiresome
lot,
but
Cat
seems
to
have
become
attached
to
you,
for
reasons
I
cannot
comprehend.
I
shall
try
to
keep
you
alive
for
her
sake.
A
fool’s
task,
admittedly,
but
I
could
never
refuse
your
wife
anything.”

“I
told
Petyr
our
suspicions
about
Jon
Arryn’s
death,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
has
promised
to
help
you
find
the
truth.”

That
was
not
news
that
Eddard
Stark
welcomed,
but
it
was
true
enough
that
they
needed
help,
and
Littlefinger
had
been
almost
a
brother
to
Cat
once.
It
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
Ned
had
been
forced
to
make
common
cause
with
a
man
he
despised.
“Very
well,”
he
said,
thrusting
the
dagger
into
his
belt.
“You
spoke
of
Varys.
Does
the
eunuch
know
all
of
it?”

“Not
from
my
lips,”
Catelyn
said.
“You
did
not
wed
a
fool,
Eddard
Stark.
But
Varys
has
ways
of
learning
things
that
no
man
could
know.
He
has
some
dark
art,
Ned,
I
swear
it.”

“He
has
spies,
that
is
well
known,”
Ned
said,
dismissive.

“It
is
more
than
that,”
Catelyn
insisted.
“Ser
Rodrik
spoke
to
Ser
Aron
Santagar
in
all
secrecy,
yet
somehow
the
Spider
knew
of
their
conversation.
I
fear
that
man.”

Littlefinger
smiled.
“Leave
Lord
Varys
to
me,
sweet
lady.
If
you
will
permit
me
a
small
obscenity—and
where
better
for
it—I
hold
the
man’s
balls
in
the
palm
of
my
hand.”
He
cupped
his
fingers,
smiling.
“Or
would,
if
he
were
a
man,
or
had
any
balls.
You
see,
if
the
pie
is
opened,
the
birds
begin
to
sing,
and
Varys
would
not
like
that.
Were
I
you,
I
would
worry
more
about
the
Lannisters
and
less
about
the
eunuch.”

Ned
did
not
need
Littlefinger
to
tell
him
that.
He
was
thinking
back
to
the
day
Arya
had
been
found,
to
the
look
on
the
queen’s
face
when
she
said,
We
have
a
wolf,
so
soft
and
quiet.
He
was
thinking
of
the
boy
Mycah,
of
Jon
Arryn’s
sudden
death,
of
Bran’s
fall,
of
old
mad
Aerys
Targaryen
dying
on
the
floor
of
his
throne
room
while
his
life’s
blood
dried
on
a
golden
blade.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
turning
to
Catelyn,
“there
is
nothing
more
you
can
do
here.
I
want
you
to
return
to
Winterfell
at
once.
If
there
was
one
assassin,
there
could
be
others.
Whoever
ordered
Bran’s
death
will
learn
soon
enough
that
the
boy
still
lives.”

“I
had
hoped
to
see
the
girls…”
Catelyn
said.

“That
would
be
most
unwise,”
Littlefinger
put
in.
“The
Red
Keep
is
full
of
curious
eyes,
and
children
talk.”

“He
speaks
truly,
my
love,”
Ned
told
her.
He
embraced
her.
“Take
Ser
Rodrik
and
ride
for
Winterfell.
I
will
watch
over
the
girls.
Go
home
to
our
sons
and
keep
them
safe.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Catelyn
lifted
her
face,
and
Ned
kissed
her.
Her
maimed
fingers
clutched
against
his
back
with
a
desperate
strength,
as
if
to
hold
him
safe
forever
in
the
shelter
of
her
arms.

“Would
the
lord
and
lady
like
the
use
of
a
bedchamber?”
asked
Littlefinger.
“I
should
warn
you,
Stark,
we
usually
charge
for
that
sort
of
thing
around
here.”

“A
moment
alone,
that’s
all
I
ask,”
Catelyn
said.

“Very
well.”
Littlefinger
strolled
to
the
door.
“Don’t
be
too
long.
It
is
past
time
the
Hand
and
I
returned
to
the
castle,
before
our
absence
is
noted.”

Catelyn
went
to
him
and
took
his
hands
in
her
own.
“I
will
not
forget
the
help
you
gave
me,
Petyr.
When
your
men
came
for
me,
I
did
not
know
whether
they
were
taking
me
to
a
friend
or
an
enemy.
I
have
found
you
more
than
a
friend.
I
have
found
a
brother
I’d
thought
lost.”

Petyr
Baelish
smiled.
“I
am
desperately
sentimental,
sweet
lady.
Best
not
tell
anyone.
I
have
spent
years
convincing
the
court
that
I
am
wicked
and
cruel,
and
I
should
hate
to
see
all
that
hard
work
go
for
naught.”

Ned
believed
not
a
word
of
that,
but
he
kept
his
voice
polite
as
he
said,
“You
have
my
thanks
as
well,
Lord
Baelish.”

“Oh,
now
there’s
a
treasure,”
Littlefinger
said,
exiting.

When
the
door
had
closed
behind
him,
Ned
turned
back
to
his
wife.
“Once
you
are
home,
send
word
to
Helman
Tallhart
and
Galbart
Glover
under
my
seal.
They
are
to
raise
a
hundred
bowmen
each
and
fortify
Moat
Cailin.
Two
hundred
determined
archers
can
hold
the
Neck
against
an
army.
Instruct
Lord
Manderly
that
he
is
to
strengthen
and
repair
all
his
defenses
at
White
Harbor,
and
see
that
they
are
well
manned.
And
from
this
day
on,
I
want
a
careful
watch
kept
over
Theon
Greyjoy.
If
there
is
war,
we
shall
have
sore
need
of
his
father’s
fleet.”

“War?”
The
fear
was
plain
on
Catelyn’s
face.

“It
will
not
come
to
that,”
Ned
promised
her,
praying
it
was
true.
He
took
her
in
his
arms
again.
“The
Lannisters
are
merciless
in
the
face
of
weakness,
as
Aerys
Targaryen
learned
to
his
sorrow,
but
they
would
not
dare
attack
the
north
without
all
the
power
of
the
realm
behind
them,
and
that
they
shall
not
have.
I
must
play
out
this
fool’s
masquerade
as
if
nothing
is
amiss.
Remember
why
I
came
here,
my
love.
If
I
find
proof
that
the
Lannisters
murdered
Jon
Arryn…”

He
felt
Catelyn
tremble
in
his
arms.
Her
scarred
hands
clung
to
him.
“If,”
she
said,
“what
then,
my
love?”

That
was
the
most
dangerous
part,
Ned
knew.
“All
justice
flows
from
the
king,”
he
told
her.
“When
I
know
the
truth,
I
must
go
to
Robert.”
And
pray
that
he
is
the
man
I
think
he
is,
he
finished
silently,
and
not
the
man
I
fear
he
has
become.





TYRION

“Are
you
certain
that
you
must
leave
us
so
soon?”
the
Lord
Commander
asked
him.

“Past
certain,
Lord
Mormont,”
Tyrion
replied.
“My
brother
Jaime
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me.
He
may
decide
that
you
have
convinced
me
to
take
the
black.”

“Would
that
I
could.”
Mormont
picked
up
a
crab
claw
and
cracked
it
in
his
fist.
Old
as
he
was,
the
Lord
Commander
still
had
the
strength
of
a
bear.
“You’re
a
cunning
man,
Tyrion.
We
have
need
of
men
of
your
sort
on
the
Wall.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“Then
I
shall
scour
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
dwarfs
and
ship
them
all
to
you,
Lord
Mormont.”
As
they
laughed,
he
sucked
the
meat
from
a
crab
leg
and
reached
for
another.
The
crabs
had
arrived
from
Eastwatch
only
this
morning,
packed
in
a
barrel
of
snow,
and
they
were
succulent.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
the
only
man
at
table
who
did
not
so
much
as
crack
a
smile.
“Lannister
mocks
us.”

“Only
you,
Ser
Alliser,”
Tyrion
said.
This
time
the
laughter
round
the
table
had
a
nervous,
uncertain
quality
to
it.

Thorne’s
black
eyes
fixed
on
Tyrion
with
loathing.
“You
have
a
bold
tongue
for
someone
who
is
less
than
half
a
man.
Perhaps
you
and
I
should
visit
the
yard
together.”

“Why?”
asked
Tyrion.
“The
crabs
are
here.”

The
remark
brought
more
guffaws
from
the
others.
Ser
Alliser
stood
up,
his
mouth
a
tight
line.
“Come
and
make
your
japes
with
steel
in
your
hand.”

Tyrion
looked
pointedly
at
his
right
hand.
“Why,
I
have
steel
in
my
hand,
Ser
Alliser,
although
it
appears
to
be
a
crab
fork.
Shall
we
duel?”
He
hopped
up
on
his
chair
and
began
poking
at
Thorne’s
chest
with
the
tiny
fork.
Roars
of
laughter
filled
the
tower
room.
Bits
of
crab
flew
from
the
Lord
Commander’s
mouth
as
he
began
to
gasp
and
choke.
Even
his
raven
joined
in,
cawing
loudly
from
above
the
window.
“Duel!
Duel!
Duel!”

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
walked
from
the
room
so
stiffly
it
looked
as
though
he
had
a
dagger
up
his
butt.

Mormont
was
still
gasping
for
breath.
Tyrion
pounded
him
on
the
back.
“To
the
victor
goes
the
spoils,”
he
called
out.
“I
claim
Thorne’s
share
of
the
crabs.”

Finally
the
Lord
Commander
recovered
himself.
“You
are
a
wicked
man,
to
provoke
our
Ser
Alliser
so,”
he
scolded.

Tyrion
seated
himself
and
took
a
sip
of
wine.
“If
a
man
paints
a
target
on
his
chest,
he
should
expect
that
sooner
or
later
someone
will
loose
an
arrow
at
him.
I
have
seen
dead
men
with
more
humor
than
your
Ser
Alliser.”

“Not
so,”
objected
the
Lord
Steward,
Bowen
Marsh,
a
man
as
round
and
red
as
a
pomegranate.
“You
ought
to
hear
the
droll
names
he
gives
the
lads
he
trains.”

Tyrion
had
heard
a
few
of
those
droll
names.
“I’ll
wager
the
lads
have
a
few
names
for
him
as
well,”
he
said.
“Chip
the
ice
off
your
eyes,
my
good
lords.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
should
be
mucking
out
your
stables,
not
drilling
your
young
warriors.”

“The
Watch
has
no
shortage
of
stableboys,”
Lord
Mormont
grumbled.
“That
seems
to
be
all
they
send
us
these
days.
Stableboys
and
sneak
thieves
and
rapers.
Ser
Alliser
is
an
anointed
knight,
one
of
the
few
to
take
the
black
since
I
have
been
Lord
Commander.
He
fought
bravely
at
King’s
Landing.”

“On
the
wrong
side,”
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
commented
dryly.
“I
ought
to
know,
I
was
there
on
the
battlements
beside
him.
Tywin
Lannister
gave
us
a
splendid
choice.
Take
the
black,
or
see
our
heads
on
spikes
before
evenfall.
No
offense
intended,
Tyrion.”

“None
taken,
Ser
Jaremy.
My
father
is
very
fond
of
spiked
heads,
especially
those
of
people
who
have
annoyed
him
in
some
fashion.
And
a
face
as
noble
as
yours,
well,
no
doubt
he
saw
you
decorating
the
city
wall
above
the
King’s
Gate.
I
think
you
would
have
looked
very
striking
up
there.”

“Thank
you,”
Ser
Jaremy
replied
with
a
sardonic
smile.

Lord
Commander
Mormont
cleared
his
throat.
“Sometimes
I
fear
Ser
Alliser
saw
you
true,
Tyrion.
You
do
mock
us
and
our
noble
purpose
here.”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“We
all
need
to
be
mocked
from
time
to
time,
Lord
Mormont,
lest
we
start
to
take
ourselves
too
seriously.
More
wine,
please.”
He
held
out
his
cup.

As
Rykker
filled
it
for
him,
Bowen
Marsh
said,
“You
have
a
great
thirst
for
a
small
man.”

“Oh,
I
think
that
Lord
Tyrion
is
quite
a
large
man,”
Maester
Aemon
said
from
the
far
end
of
the
table.
He
spoke
softly,
yet
the
high
officers
of
the
Night’s
Watch
all
fell
quiet,
the
better
to
hear
what
the
ancient
had
to
say.
“I
think
he
is
a
giant
come
among
us,
here
at
the
end
of
the
world.”

Tyrion
answered
gently,
“I’ve
been
called
many
things,
my
lord,
but
giant
is
seldom
one
of
them.”

“Nonetheless,”
Maester
Aemon
said
as
his
clouded,
milk-white
eyes
moved
to
Tyrion’s
face,
“I
think
it
is
true.”

For
once,
Tyrion
Lannister
found
himself
at
a
loss
for
words.
He
could
only
bow
his
head
politely
and
say,
“You
are
too
kind,
Maester
Aemon.”

The
blind
man
smiled.
He
was
a
tiny
thing,
wrinkled
and
hairless,
shrunken
beneath
the
weight
of
a
hundred
years
so
his
maester’s
collar
with
its
links
of
many
metals
hung
loose
about
his
throat.
“I
have
been
called
many
things,
my
lord,”
he
said,
“but
kind
is
seldom
one
of
them.”
This
time
Tyrion
himself
led
the
laughter.

Much
later,
when
the
serious
business
of
eating
was
done
and
the
others
had
left,
Mormont
offered
Tyrion
a
chair
beside
the
fire
and
a
cup
of
mulled
spirits
so
strong
they
brought
tears
to
his
eyes.
“The
kingsroad
can
be
perilous
this
far
north,”
the
Lord
Commander
told
him
as
they
drank.

“I
have
Jyck
and
Morrec,”
Tyrion
said,
“and
Yoren
is
riding
south
again.”

“Yoren
is
only
one
man.
The
Watch
shall
escort
you
as
far
as
Winterfell,”
Mormont
announced
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
argument.
“Three
men
should
be
sufficient.”

“If
you
insist,
my
lord,”
Tyrion
said.
“You
might
send
young
Snow.
He
would
be
glad
for
a
chance
to
see
his
brothers.”

Mormont
frowned
through
his
thick
grey
beard.
“Snow?
Oh,
the
Stark
bastard.
I
think
not.
The
young
ones
need
to
forget
the
lives
they
left
behind
them,
the
brothers
and
mothers
and
all
that.
A
visit
home
would
only
stir
up
feelings
best
left
alone.
I
know
these
things.
My
own
blood
kin…
my
sister
Maege
rules
Bear
Island
now,
since
my
son’s
dishonor.
I
have
nieces
I
have
never
seen.”
He
took
a
swallow.
“Besides,
Jon
Snow
is
only
a
boy.
You
shall
have
three
strong
swords,
to
keep
you
safe.”

“I
am
touched
by
your
concern,
Lord
Mormont.”
The
strong
drink
was
making
Tyrion
light-headed,
but
not
so
drunk
that
he
did
not
realize
that
the
Old
Bear
wanted
something
from
him.
“I
hope
I
can
repay
your
kindness.”

“You
can,”
Mormont
said
bluntly.
“Your
sister
sits
beside
the
king.
Your
brother
is
a
great
knight,
and
your
father
the
most
powerful
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Speak
to
them
for
us.
Tell
them
of
our
need
here.
You
have
seen
for
yourself,
my
lord.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
dying.
Our
strength
is
less
than
a
thousand
now.
Six
hundred
here,
two
hundred
in
the
Shadow
Tower,
even
fewer
at
Eastwatch,
and
a
scant
third
of
those
fighting
men.
The
Wall
is
a
hundred
leagues
long.
Think
on
that.
Should
an
attack
come,
I
have
three
men
to
defend
each
mile
of
wall.”

“Three
and
a
third,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
yawn.

Mormont
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
him.
The
old
man
warmed
his
hands
before
the
fire.
“I
sent
Benjen
Stark
to
search
after
Yohn
Royce’s
son,
lost
on
his
first
ranging.
The
Royce
boy
was
green
as
summer
grass,
yet
he
insisted
on
the
honor
of
his
own
command,
saying
it
was
his
due
as
a
knight.
I
did
not
wish
to
offend
his
lord
father,
so
I
yielded.
I
sent
him
out
with
two
men
I
deemed
as
good
as
any
in
the
Watch.
More
fool
I.”

“Fool,”
the
raven
agreed.
Tyrion
glanced
up.
The
bird
peered
down
at
him
with
those
beady
black
eyes,
ruffling
its
wings.
“Fool,”
it
called
again.
Doubtless
old
Mormont
would
take
it
amiss
if
he
throttled
the
creature.
A
pity.

The
Lord
Commander
took
no
notice
of
the
irritating
bird.
“Gared
was
near
as
old
as
I
am
and
longer
on
the
Wall,”
he
went
on,
“yet
it
would
seem
he
forswore
himself
and
fled.
I
should
never
have
believed
it,
not
of
him,
but
Lord
Eddard
sent
me
his
head
from
Winterfell.
Of
Royce,
there
is
no
word.
One
deserter
and
two
men
lost,
and
now
Ben
Stark
too
has
gone
missing.”
He
sighed
deeply.
“Who
am
I
to
send
searching
after
him?
In
two
years
I
will
be
seventy.
Too
old
and
too
weary
for
the
burden
I
bear,
yet
if
I
set
it
down,
who
will
pick
it
up?
Alliser
Thorne?
Bowen
Marsh?
I
would
have
to
be
as
blind
as
Maester
Aemon
not
to
see
what
they
are.
The
Night’s
Watch
has
become
an
army
of
sullen
boys
and
tired
old
men.
Apart
from
the
men
at
my
table
tonight,
I
have
perhaps
twenty
who
can
read,
and
even
fewer
who
can
think,
or
plan,
or
lead.
Once
the
Watch
spent
its
summers
building,
and
each
Lord
Commander
raised
the
Wall
higher
than
he
found
it.
Now
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
stay
alive.”

He
was
in
deadly
earnest,
Tyrion
realized.
He
felt
faintly
embarrassed
for
the
old
man.
Lord
Mormont
had
spent
a
good
part
of
his
life
on
the
Wall,
and
he
needed
to
believe
if
those
years
were
to
have
any
meaning.
“I
promise,
the
king
will
hear
of
your
need,”
Tyrion
said
gravely,
“and
I
will
speak
to
my
father
and
my
brother
Jaime
as
well.”
And
he
would.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
as
good
as
his
word.
He
left
the
rest
unsaid;
that
King
Robert
would
ignore
him,
Lord
Tywin
would
ask
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses,
and
Jaime
would
only
laugh.

“You
are
a
young
man,
Tyrion,”
Mormont
said.
“How
many
winters
have
you
seen?”

He
shrugged.
“Eight,
nine.
I
misremember.”

“And
all
of
them
short.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
He
had
been
born
in
the
dead
of
winter,
a
terrible
cruel
one
that
the
maesters
said
had
lasted
near
three
years,
but
Tyrion’s
earliest
memories
were
of
spring.

“When
I
was
a
boy,
it
was
said
that
a
long
summer
always
meant
a
long
winter
to
come.
This
summer
has
lasted
nine
years,
Tyrion,
and
a
tenth
will
soon
be
upon
us.
Think
on
that.”

“When
I
was
a
boy,”
Tyrion
replied,
“my
wet
nurse
told
me
that
one
day,
if
men
were
good,
the
gods
would
give
the
world
a
summer
without
ending.
Perhaps
we’ve
been
better
than
we
thought,
and
the
Great
Summer
is
finally
at
hand.”
He
grinned.

The
Lord
Commander
did
not
seem
amused.
“You
are
not
fool
enough
to
believe
that,
my
lord.
Already
the
days
grow
shorter.
There
can
be
no
mistake,
Aemon
has
had
letters
from
the
Citadel,
findings
in
accord
with
his
own.
The
end
of
summer
stares
us
in
the
face.”
Mormont
reached
out
and
clutched
Tyrion
tightly
by
the
hand.
“You
must
make
them
understand.
I
tell
you,
my
lord,
the
darkness
is
coming.
There
are
wild
things
in
the
woods,
direwolves
and
mammoths
and
snow
bears
the
size
of
aurochs,
and
I
have
seen
darker
shapes
in
my
dreams.”

“In
your
dreams,”
Tyrion
echoed,
thinking
how
badly
he
needed
another
strong
drink.

Mormont
was
deaf
to
the
edge
in
his
voice.
“The
fisherfolk
near
Eastwatch
have
glimpsed
white
walkers
on
the
shore.”

This
time
Tyrion
could
not
hold
his
tongue.
“The
fisherfolk
of
Lannisport
often
glimpse
merlings.”

“Denys
Mallister
writes
that
the
mountain
people
are
moving
south,
slipping
past
the
Shadow
Tower
in
numbers
greater
than
ever
before.
They
are
running,
my
lord…
but
running
from
what?”
Lord
Mormont
moved
to
the
window
and
stared
out
into
the
night.
“These
are
old
bones,
Lannister,
but
they
have
never
felt
a
chill
like
this.
Tell
the
king
what
I
say,
I
pray
you.
Winter
is
coming,
and
when
the
Long
Night
falls,
only
the
Night’s
Watch
will
stand
between
the
realm
and
the
darkness
that
sweeps
from
the
north.
The
gods
help
us
all
if
we
are
not
ready.”

“The
gods
help
me
if
I
do
not
get
some
sleep
tonight.
Yoren
is
determined
to
ride
at
first
light.”
Tyrion
got
to
his
feet,
sleepy
from
wine
and
tired
of
doom.
“I
thank
you
for
all
the
courtesies
you
have
done
me,
Lord
Mormont.”

“Tell
them,
Tyrion.
Tell
them
and
make
them
believe.
That
is
all
the
thanks
I
need.”
He
whistled,
and
his
raven
flew
to
him
and
perched
on
his
shoulder.
Mormont
smiled
and
gave
the
bird
some
corn
from
his
pocket,
and
that
was
how
Tyrion
left
him.

It
was
bitter
cold
outside.
Bundled
thickly
in
his
furs,
Tyrion
Lannister
pulled
on
his
gloves
and
nodded
to
the
poor
frozen
wretches
standing
sentry
outside
the
Commander’s
Keep.
He
set
off
across
the
yard
for
his
own
chambers
in
the
King’s
Tower,
walking
as
briskly
as
his
legs
could
manage.
Patches
of
snow
crunched
beneath
his
feet
as
his
boots
broke
the
night’s
crust,
and
his
breath
steamed
before
him
like
a
banner.
He
shoved
his
hands
into
his
armpits
and
walked
faster,
praying
that
Morrec
had
remembered
to
warm
his
bed
with
hot
bricks
from
the
fire.

Behind
the
King’s
Tower,
the
Wall
glimmered
in
the
light
of
the
moon,
immense
and
mysterious.
Tyrion
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
it.
His
legs
ached
of
cold
and
haste.

Suddenly
a
strange
madness
took
hold
of
him,
a
yearning
to
look
once
more
off
the
end
of
the
world.
It
would
be
his
last
chance,
he
thought;
tomorrow
he
would
ride
south,
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
would
ever
want
to
return
to
this
frozen
desolation.
The
King’s
Tower
was
before
him,
with
its
promise
of
warmth
and
a
soft
bed,
yet
Tyrion
found
himself
walking
past
it,
toward
the
vast
pale
palisade
of
the
Wall.

A
wooden
stair
ascended
the
south
face,
anchored
on
huge
rough-hewn
beams
sunk
deep
into
the
ice
and
frozen
in
place.
Back
and
forth
it
switched,
clawing
its
way
upward
as
crooked
as
a
bolt
of
lightning.
The
black
brothers
assured
him
that
it
was
much
stronger
than
it
looked,
but
Tyrion’s
legs
were
cramping
too
badly
for
him
to
even
contemplate
the
ascent.
He
went
instead
to
the
iron
cage
beside
the
well,
clambered
inside,
and
yanked
hard
on
the
bell
rope,
three
quick
pulls.

He
had
to
wait
what
seemed
an
eternity,
standing
there
inside
the
bars
with
the
Wall
to
his
back.
Long
enough
for
Tyrion
to
begin
to
wonder
why
he
was
doing
this.
He
had
just
about
decided
to
forget
his
sudden
whim
and
go
to
bed
when
the
cage
gave
a
jerk
and
began
to
ascend.

He
moved
upward
slowly,
by
fits
and
starts
at
first,
then
more
smoothly.
The
ground
fell
away
beneath
him,
the
cage
swung,
and
Tyrion
wrapped
his
hands
around
the
iron
bars.
He
could
feel
the
cold
of
the
metal
even
through
his
gloves.
Morrec
had
a
fire
burning
in
his
room,
he
noted
with
approval,
but
the
Lord
Commander’s
tower
was
dark.
The
Old
Bear
had
more
sense
than
he
did,
it
seemed.

Then
he
was
above
the
towers,
still
inching
his
way
upward.
Castle
Black
lay
below
him,
etched
in
moonlight.
You
could
see
how
stark
and
empty
it
was
from
up
here;
windowless
keeps,
crumbling
walls,
courtyards
choked
with
broken
stone.
Farther
off,
he
could
see
the
lights
of
Mole’s
Town,
the
little
village
half
a
league
south
along
the
kingsroad,
and
here
and
there
the
bright
glitter
of
moonlight
on
water
where
icy
streams
descended
from
the
mountain
heights
to
cut
across
the
plains.
The
rest
of
the
world
was
a
bleak
emptiness
of
windswept
hills
and
rocky
fields
spotted
with
snow.

Finally
a
thick
voice
behind
him
said,
“Seven
hells,
it’s
the
dwarf,”
and
the
cage
jerked
to
a
sudden
stop
and
hung
there,
swinging
slowly
back
and
forth,
the
ropes
creaking.

“Bring
him
in,
damn
it.”
There
was
a
grunt
and
a
loud
groaning
of
wood
as
the
cage
slid
sideways
and
then
the
Wall
was
beneath
him.
Tyrion
waited
until
the
swinging
had
stopped
before
he
pushed
open
the
cage
door
and
hopped
down
onto
the
ice.
A
heavy
figure
in
black
was
leaning
on
the
winch,
while
a
second
held
the
cage
with
a
gloved
hand.
Their
faces
were
muffled
in
woolen
scarves
so
only
their
eyes
showed,
and
they
were
plump
with
layers
of
wool
and
leather,
black
on
black.
“And
what
will
you
be
wanting,
this
time
of
night?”
the
one
by
the
winch
asked.

“A
last
look.”

The
men
exchanged
sour
glances.
“Look
all
you
want,”
the
other
one
said.
“Just
have
a
care
you
don’t
fall
off,
little
man.
The
Old
Bear
would
have
our
hides.”
A
small
wooden
shack
stood
under
the
great
crane,
and
Tyrion
saw
the
dull
glow
of
a
brazier
and
felt
a
brief
gust
of
warmth
when
the
winch
men
opened
the
door
and
went
back
inside.
And
then
he
was
alone.

It
was
bitingly
cold
up
here,
and
the
wind
pulled
at
his
clothes
like
an
insistent
lover.
The
top
of
the
Wall
was
wider
than
the
kingsroad
often
was,
so
Tyrion
had
no
fear
of
falling,
although
the
footing
was
slicker
than
he
would
have
liked.
The
brothers
spread
crushed
stone
across
the
walkways,
but
the
weight
of
countless
footsteps
would
melt
the
Wall
beneath,
so
the
ice
would
seem
to
grow
around
the
gravel,
swallowing
it,
until
the
path
was
bare
again
and
it
was
time
to
crush
more
stone.

Still,
it
was
nothing
that
Tyrion
could
not
manage.
He
looked
off
to
the
east
and
west,
at
the
Wall
stretching
before
him,
a
vast
white
road
with
no
beginning
and
no
end
and
a
dark
abyss
on
either
side.
West,
he
decided,
for
no
special
reason,
and
he
began
to
walk
that
way,
following
the
pathway
nearest
the
north
edge,
where
the
gravel
looked
freshest.

His
bare
cheeks
were
ruddy
with
the
cold,
and
his
legs
complained
more
loudly
with
every
step,
but
Tyrion
ignored
them.
The
wind
swirled
around
him,
gravel
crunched
beneath
his
boots,
while
ahead
the
white
ribbon
followed
the
lines
of
the
hills,
rising
higher
and
higher,
until
it
was
lost
beyond
the
western
horizon.
He
passed
a
massive
catapult,
as
tall
as
a
city
wall,
its
base
sunk
deep
into
the
Wall.
The
throwing
arm
had
been
taken
off
for
repairs
and
then
forgotten;
it
lay
there
like
a
broken
toy,
half-embedded
in
the
ice.

On
the
far
side
of
the
catapult,
a
muffled
voice
called
out
a
challenge.
“Who
goes
there?
Halt!”

Tyrion
stopped.
“If
I
halt
too
long
I’ll
freeze
in
place,
Jon,”
he
said
as
a
shaggy
pale
shape
slid
toward
him
silently
and
sniffed
at
his
furs.
“Hello,
Ghost.”

Jon
Snow
moved
closer.
He
looked
bigger
and
heavier
in
his
layers
of
fur
and
leather,
the
hood
of
his
cloak
pulled
down
over
his
face.
“Lannister,”
he
said,
yanking
loose
the
scarf
to
uncover
his
mouth.
“This
is
the
last
place
I
would
have
expected
to
see
you.”
He
carried
a
heavy
spear
tipped
in
iron,
taller
than
he
was,
and
a
sword
hung
at
his
side
in
a
leather
sheath.
Across
his
chest
was
a
gleaming
black
warhorn,
banded
with
silver.

“This
is
the
last
place
I
would
have
expected
to
be
seen,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“I
was
captured
by
a
whim.
If
I
touch
Ghost,
will
he
chew
my
hand
off?”

“Not
with
me
here,”
Jon
promised.

Tyrion
scratched
the
white
wolf
behind
the
ears.
The
red
eyes
watched
him
impassively.
The
beast
came
up
as
high
as
his
chest
now.
Another
year,
and
Tyrion
had
the
gloomy
feeling
he’d
be
looking
up
at
him.
“What
are
you
doing
up
here
tonight?”
he
asked.
“Besides
freezing
your
manhood
off…”

“I
have
drawn
night
guard,”
Jon
said.
“Again.
Ser
Alliser
has
kindly
arranged
for
the
watch
commander
to
take
a
special
interest
in
me.
He
seems
to
think
that
if
they
keep
me
awake
half
the
night,
I’ll
fall
asleep
during
morning
drill.
So
far
I
have
disappointed
him.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“And
has
Ghost
learned
to
juggle
yet?”

“No,”
said
Jon,
smiling,
“but
Grenn
held
his
own
against
Halder
this
morning,
and
Pyp
is
no
longer
dropping
his
sword
quite
so
often
as
he
did.”

“Pyp?”

“Pypar
is
his
real
name.
The
small
boy
with
the
large
ears.
He
saw
me
working
with
Grenn
and
asked
for
help.
Thorne
had
never
even
shown
him
the
proper
way
to
grip
a
sword.”
He
turned
to
look
north.
“I
have
a
mile
of
Wall
to
guard.
Will
you
walk
with
me?”

“If
you
walk
slowly,”
Tyrion
said.

“The
watch
commander
tells
me
I
must
walk,
to
keep
my
blood
from
freezing,
but
he
never
said
how
fast.”

They
walked,
with
Ghost
pacing
along
beside
Jon
like
a
white
shadow.
“I
leave
on
the
morrow,”
Tyrion
said.

“I
know.”
Jon
sounded
strangely
sad.

“I
plan
to
stop
at
Winterfell
on
the
way
south.
If
there
is
any
message
that
you
would
like
me
to
deliver…”

“Tell
Robb
that
I’m
going
to
command
the
Night’s
Watch
and
keep
him
safe,
so
he
might
as
well
take
up
needlework
with
the
girls
and
have
Mikken
melt
down
his
sword
for
horseshoes.”

“Your
brother
is
bigger
than
me,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
laugh.
“I
decline
to
deliver
any
message
that
might
get
me
killed.”

“Rickon
will
ask
when
I’m
coming
home.
Try
to
explain
where
I’ve
gone,
if
you
can.
Tell
him
he
can
have
all
my
things
while
I’m
away,
he’ll
like
that.”

People
seemed
to
be
asking
a
great
deal
of
him
today,
Tyrion
Lannister
thought.
“You
could
put
all
this
in
a
letter,
you
know.”

“Rickon
can’t
read
yet.
Bran…”
He
stopped
suddenly.
“I
don’t
know
what
message
to
send
to
Bran.
Help
him,
Tyrion.”

“What
help
could
I
give
him?
I
am
no
maester,
to
ease
his
pain.
I
have
no
spells
to
give
him
back
his
legs.”

“You
gave
me
help
when
I
needed
it,”
Jon
Snow
said.

“I
gave
you
nothing,”
Tyrion
said.
“Words.”

“Then
give
your
words
to
Bran
too.”

“You’re
asking
a
lame
man
to
teach
a
cripple
how
to
dance,”
Tyrion
said.
“However
sincere
the
lesson,
the
result
is
likely
to
be
grotesque.
Still,
I
know
what
it
is
to
love
a
brother,
Lord
Snow.
I
will
give
Bran
whatever
small
help
is
in
my
power.”

“Thank
you,
my
lord
of
Lannister.”
He
pulled
off
his
glove
and
offered
his
bare
hand.
“Friend.”

Tyrion
found
himself
oddly
touched.
“Most
of
my
kin
are
bastards,”
he
said
with
a
wry
smile,
“but
you’re
the
first
I’ve
had
to
friend.”
He
pulled
a
glove
off
with
his
teeth
and
clasped
Snow
by
the
hand,
flesh
against
flesh.
The
boy’s
grip
was
firm
and
strong.

When
he
had
donned
his
glove
again,
Jon
Snow
turned
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
low,
icy
northern
parapet.
Beyond
him
the
Wall
fell
away
sharply;
beyond
him
there
was
only
the
darkness
and
the
wild.
Tyrion
followed
him,
and
side
by
side
they
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
world.

The
Night’s
Watch
permitted
the
forest
to
come
no
closer
than
half
a
mile
of
the
north
face
of
the
Wall.
The
thickets
of
ironwood
and
sentinel
and
oak
that
had
once
grown
there
had
been
harvested
centuries
ago,
to
create
a
broad
swath
of
open
ground
through
which
no
enemy
could
hope
to
pass
unseen.
Tyrion
had
heard
that
elsewhere
along
the
Wall,
between
the
three
fortresses,
the
wildwood
had
come
creeping
back
over
the
decades,
that
there
were
places
where
grey-green
sentinels
and
pale
white
weirwoods
had
taken
root
in
the
shadow
of
the
Wall
itself,
but
Castle
Black
had
a
prodigious
appetite
for
firewood,
and
here
the
forest
was
still
kept
at
bay
by
the
axes
of
the
black
brothers.

It
was
never
far,
though.
From
up
here
Tyrion
could
see
it,
the
dark
trees
looming
beyond
the
stretch
of
open
ground,
like
a
second
wall
built
parallel
to
the
first,
a
wall
of
night.
Few
axes
had
ever
swung
in
that
black
wood,
where
even
the
moonlight
could
not
penetrate
the
ancient
tangle
of
root
and
thorn
and
grasping
limb.
Out
there
the
trees
grew
huge,
and
the
rangers
said
they
seemed
to
brood
and
knew
not
men.
It
was
small
wonder
the
Night’s
Watch
named
it
the
haunted
forest.

As
he
stood
there
and
looked
at
all
that
darkness
with
no
fires
burning
anywhere,
with
the
wind
blowing
and
the
cold
like
a
spear
in
his
guts,
Tyrion
Lannister
felt
as
though
he
could
almost
believe
the
talk
of
the
Others,
the
enemy
in
the
night.
His
jokes
of
grumkins
and
snarks
no
longer
seemed
quite
so
droll.

“My
uncle
is
out
there,”
Jon
Snow
said
softly,
leaning
on
his
spear
as
he
stared
off
into
the
darkness.
“The
first
night
they
sent
me
up
here,
I
thought,
Uncle
Benjen
will
ride
back
tonight,
and
I’ll
see
him
first
and
blow
the
horn.
He
never
came,
though.
Not
that
night
and
not
any
night.”

“Give
him
time,”
Tyrion
said.

Far
off
to
the
north,
a
wolf
began
to
howl.
Another
voice
picked
up
the
call,
then
another.
Ghost
cocked
his
head
and
listened.
“If
he
doesn’t
come
back,”
Jon
Snow
promised,
“Ghost
and
I
will
go
find
him.”
He
put
his
hand
on
the
direwolf’s
head.

“I
believe
you,”
Tyrion
said,
but
what
he
thought
was,
And
who
will
go
find
you?
He
shivered.





ARYA

Her
father
had
been
fighting
with
the
council
again.
Arya
could
see
it
on
his
face
when
he
came
to
table,
late
again,
as
he
had
been
so
often.
The
first
course,
a
thick
sweet
soup
made
with
pumpkins,
had
already
been
taken
away
when
Ned
Stark
strode
into
the
Small
Hall.
They
called
it
that
to
set
it
apart
from
the
Great
Hall,
where
the
king
could
feast
a
thousand,
but
it
was
a
long
room
with
a
high
vaulted
ceiling
and
bench
space
for
two
hundred
at
its
trestle
tables.

“My
lord,”
Jory
said
when
Father
entered.
He
rose
to
his
feet,
and
the
rest
of
the
guard
rose
with
him.
Each
man
wore
a
new
cloak,
heavy
grey
wool
with
a
white
satin
border.
A
hand
of
beaten
silver
clutched
the
woolen
folds
of
each
cloak
and
marked
their
wearers
as
men
of
the
Hand’s
household
guard.
There
were
only
fifty
of
them,
so
most
of
the
benches
were
empty.

“Be
seated,”
Eddard
Stark
said.
“I
see
you
have
started
without
me.
I
am
pleased
to
know
there
are
still
some
men
of
sense
in
this
city.”
He
signaled
for
the
meal
to
resume.
The
servants
began
bringing
out
platters
of
ribs,
roasted
in
a
crust
of
garlic
and
herbs.

“The
talk
in
the
yard
is
we
shall
have
a
tourney,
my
lord,”
Jory
said
as
he
resumed
his
seat.
“They
say
that
knights
will
come
from
all
over
the
realm
to
joust
and
feast
in
honor
of
your
appointment
as
Hand
of
the
King.”

Arya
could
see
that
her
father
was
not
very
happy
about
that.
“Do
they
also
say
this
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
I
would
have
wished?”

Sansa’s
eyes
had
grown
wide
as
the
plates.
“A
tourney,”
she
breathed.
She
was
seated
between
Septa
Mordane
and
Jeyne
Poole,
as
far
from
Arya
as
she
could
get
without
drawing
a
reproach
from
Father.
“Will
we
be
permitted
to
go,
Father?”

“You
know
my
feelings,
Sansa.
It
seems
I
must
arrange
Robert’s
games
and
pretend
to
be
honored
for
his
sake.
That
does
not
mean
I
must
subject
my
daughters
to
this
folly.”

“Oh,
please,”
Sansa
said.
“I
want
to
see.”

Septa
Mordane
spoke
up.
“Princess
Myrcella
will
be
there,
my
lord,
and
her
younger
than
Lady
Sansa.
All
the
ladies
of
the
court
will
be
expected
at
a
grand
event
like
this,
and
as
the
tourney
is
in
your
honor,
it
would
look
queer
if
your
family
did
not
attend.”

Father
looked
pained.
“I
suppose
so.
Very
well,
I
shall
arrange
a
place
for
you,
Sansa.”
He
saw
Arya.
“For
both
of
you.”

“I
don’t
care
about
their
stupid
tourney,”
Arya
said.
She
knew
Prince
Joffrey
would
be
there,
and
she
hated
Prince
Joffrey.

Sansa
lifted
her
head.
“It
will
be
a
splendid
event.
You
shan’t
be
wanted.”

Anger
flashed
across
Father’s
face.
“Enough,
Sansa.
More
of
that
and
you
will
change
my
mind.
I
am
weary
unto
death
of
this
endless
war
you
two
are
fighting.
You
are
sisters.
I
expect
you
to
behave
like
sisters,
is
that
understood?”

Sansa
bit
her
lip
and
nodded.
Arya
lowered
her
face
to
stare
sullenly
at
her
plate.
She
could
feel
tears
stinging
her
eyes.
She
rubbed
them
away
angrily,
determined
not
to
cry.

The
only
sound
was
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks.
“Pray
excuse
me,”
her
father
announced
to
the
table.
“I
find
I
have
small
appetite
tonight.”
He
walked
from
the
hall.

After
he
was
gone,
Sansa
exchanged
excited
whispers
with
Jeyne
Poole.
Down
the
table
Jory
laughed
at
a
joke,
and
Hullen
started
in
about
horseflesh.
“Your
warhorse,
now,
he
may
not
be
the
best
one
for
the
joust.
Not
the
same
thing,
oh,
no,
not
the
same
at
all.”
The
men
had
heard
it
all
before;
Desmond,
Jacks,
and
Hullen’s
son
Harwin
shouted
him
down
together,
and
Porther
called
for
more
wine.

No
one
talked
to
Arya.
She
didn’t
care.
She
liked
it
that
way.
She
would
have
eaten
her
meals
alone
in
her
bedchamber
if
they
let
her.
Sometimes
they
did,
when
Father
had
to
dine
with
the
king
or
some
lord
or
the
envoys
from
this
place
or
that
place.
The
rest
of
the
time,
they
ate
in
his
solar,
just
him
and
her
and
Sansa.
That
was
when
Arya
missed
her
brothers
most.
She
wanted
to
tease
Bran
and
play
with
baby
Rickon
and
have
Robb
smile
at
her.
She
wanted
Jon
to
muss
up
her
hair
and
call
her
“little
sister”
and
finish
her
sentences
with
her.
But
all
of
them
were
gone.
She
had
no
one
left
but
Sansa,
and
Sansa
wouldn’t
even
talk
to
her
unless
Father
made
her.

Back
at
Winterfell,
they
had
eaten
in
the
Great
Hall
almost
half
the
time.
Her
father
used
to
say
that
a
lord
needed
to
eat
with
his
men,
if
he
hoped
to
keep
them.
“Know
the
men
who
follow
you,”
she
heard
him
tell
Robb
once,
“and
let
them
know
you.
Don’t
ask
your
men
to
die
for
a
stranger.”
At
Winterfell,
he
always
had
an
extra
seat
set
at
his
own
table,
and
every
day
a
different
man
would
be
asked
to
join
him.
One
night
it
would
be
Vayon
Poole,
and
the
talk
would
be
coppers
and
bread
stores
and
servants.
The
next
time
it
would
be
Mikken,
and
her
father
would
listen
to
him
go
on
about
armor
and
swords
and
how
hot
a
forge
should
be
and
the
best
way
to
temper
steel.
Another
day
it
might
be
Hullen
with
his
endless
horse
talk,
or
Septon
Chayle
from
the
library,
or
Jory,
or
Ser
Rodrik,
or
even
Old
Nan
with
her
stories.

Arya
had
loved
nothing
better
than
to
sit
at
her
father’s
table
and
listen
to
them
talk.
She
had
loved
listening
to
the
men
on
the
benches
too;
to
freeriders
tough
as
leather,
courtly
knights
and
bold
young
squires,
grizzled
old
men-at-arms.
She
used
to
throw
snowballs
at
them
and
help
them
steal
pies
from
the
kitchen.
Their
wives
gave
her
scones
and
she
invented
names
for
their
babies
and
played
monsters-and-maidens
and
hide-the-treasure
and
come-into-my-castle
with
their
children.
Fat
Tom
used
to
call
her
“Arya
Underfoot,”
because
he
said
that
was
where
she
always
was.
She’d
liked
that
a
lot
better
than
“Arya
Horseface.”

Only
that
was
Winterfell,
a
world
away,
and
now
everything
was
changed.
This
was
the
first
time
they
had
supped
with
the
men
since
arriving
in
King’s
Landing.
Arya
hated
it.
She
hated
the
sounds
of
their
voices
now,
the
way
they
laughed,
the
stories
they
told.
They’d
been
her
friends,
she’d
felt
safe
around
them,
but
now
she
knew
that
was
a
lie.
They’d
let
the
queen
kill
Lady,
that
was
horrible
enough,
but
then
the
Hound
found
Mycah.
Jeyne
Poole
had
told
Arya
that
he’d
cut
him
up
in
so
many
pieces
that
they’d
given
him
back
to
the
butcher
in
a
bag,
and
at
first
the
poor
man
had
thought
it
was
a
pig
they’d
slaughtered.
And
no
one
had
raised
a
voice
or
drawn
a
blade
or
anything,
not
Harwin
who
always
talked
so
bold,
or
Alyn
who
was
going
to
be
a
knight,
or
Jory
who
was
captain
of
the
guard.
Not
even
her
father.

“He
was
my
friend,”
Arya
whispered
into
her
plate,
so
low
that
no
one
could
hear.
Her
ribs
sat
there
untouched,
grown
cold
now,
a
thin
film
of
grease
congealing
beneath
them
on
the
plate.
Arya
looked
at
them
and
felt
ill.
She
pushed
away
from
the
table.

“Pray,
where
do
you
think
you
are
going,
young
lady?”
Septa
Mordane
asked.

“I’m
not
hungry.”
Arya
found
it
an
effort
to
remember
her
courtesies.
“May
I
be
excused,
please?”
she
recited
stiffly.

“You
may
not,”
the
septa
said.
“You
have
scarcely
touched
your
food.
You
will
sit
down
and
clean
your
plate.”

“You
clean
it!”
Before
anyone
could
stop
her,
Arya
bolted
for
the
door
as
the
men
laughed
and
Septa
Mordane
called
loudly
after
her,
her
voice
rising
higher
and
higher.

Fat
Tom
was
at
his
post,
guarding
the
door
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
He
blinked
when
he
saw
Arya
rushing
toward
him
and
heard
the
septa’s
shouts.
“Here
now,
little
one,
hold
on,”
he
started
to
say,
reaching,
but
Arya
slid
between
his
legs
and
then
she
was
running
up
the
winding
tower
steps,
her
feet
hammering
on
the
stone
while
Fat
Tom
huffed
and
puffed
behind
her.

Her
bedchamber
was
the
only
place
that
Arya
liked
in
all
of
King’s
Landing,
and
the
thing
she
liked
best
about
it
was
the
door,
a
massive
slab
of
dark
oak
with
black
iron
bands.
When
she
slammed
that
door
and
dropped
the
heavy
crossbar,
nobody
could
get
into
her
room,
not
Septa
Mordane
or
Fat
Tom
or
Sansa
or
Jory
or
the
Hound,
nobody!
She
slammed
it
now.

When
the
bar
was
down,
Arya
finally
felt
safe
enough
to
cry.

She
went
to
the
window
seat
and
sat
there,
sniffling,
hating
them
all,
and
herself
most
of
all.
It
was
all
her
fault,
everything
bad
that
had
happened.
Sansa
said
so,
and
Jeyne
too.

Fat
Tom
was
knocking
on
her
door.
“Arya
girl,
what’s
wrong?”
he
called
out.
“You
in
there?”

“No!”
she
shouted.
The
knocking
stopped.
A
moment
later
she
heard
him
going
away.
Fat
Tom
was
always
easy
to
fool.

Arya
went
to
the
chest
at
the
foot
of
her
bed.
She
knelt,
opened
the
lid,
and
began
pulling
her
clothes
out
with
both
hands,
grabbing
handfuls
of
silk
and
satin
and
velvet
and
wool
and
tossing
them
on
the
floor.
It
was
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
chest,
where
she’d
hidden
it.
Arya
lifted
it
out
almost
tenderly
and
drew
the
slender
blade
from
its
sheath.

Needle.

She
thought
of
Mycah
again
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
Her
fault,
her
fault,
her
fault.
If
she
had
never
asked
him
to
play
at
swords
with
her…

There
was
a
pounding
at
her
door,
louder
than
before.
“Arya
Stark,
you
open
this
door
at
once,
do
you
hear
me?”

Arya
spun
around,
with
Needle
in
her
hand.
“You
better
not
come
in
here!”
she
warned.
She
slashed
at
the
air
savagely.

“The
Hand
will
hear
of
this!”
Septa
Mordane
raged.

“I
don’t
care,”
Arya
screamed.
“Go
away.”

“You
will
rue
this
insolent
behavior,
young
lady,
I
promise
you
that.”
Arya
listened
at
the
door
until
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
septa’s
receding
footsteps.

She
went
back
to
the
window,
Needle
in
hand,
and
looked
down
into
the
courtyard
below.
If
only
she
could
climb
like
Bran,
she
thought;
she
would
go
out
the
window
and
down
the
tower,
run
away
from
this
horrible
place,
away
from
Sansa
and
Septa
Mordane
and
Prince
Joffrey,
from
all
of
them.
Steal
some
food
from
the
kitchens,
take
Needle
and
her
good
boots
and
a
warm
cloak.
She
could
find
Nymeria
in
the
wild
woods
below
the
Trident,
and
together
they’d
return
to
Winterfell,
or
run
to
Jon
on
the
Wall.
She
found
herself
wishing
that
Jon
was
here
with
her
now.
Then
maybe
she
wouldn’t
feel
so
alone.

A
soft
knock
at
the
door
behind
her
turned
Arya
away
from
the
window
and
her
dreams
of
escape.
“Arya,”
her
father’s
voice
called
out.
“Open
the
door.
We
need
to
talk.”

Arya
crossed
the
room
and
lifted
the
crossbar.
Father
was
alone.
He
seemed
more
sad
than
angry.
That
made
Arya
feel
even
worse.
“May
I
come
in?”
Arya
nodded,
then
dropped
her
eyes,
ashamed.
Father
closed
the
door.
“Whose
sword
is
that?”

“Mine.”
Arya
had
almost
forgotten
Needle,
in
her
hand.

“Give
it
to
me.”

Reluctantly
Arya
surrendered
her
sword,
wondering
if
she
would
ever
hold
it
again.
Her
father
turned
it
in
the
light,
examining
both
sides
of
the
blade.
He
tested
the
point
with
his
thumb.
“A
bravo’s
blade,”
he
said.
“Yet
it
seems
to
me
that
I
know
this
maker’s
mark.
This
is
Mikken’s
work.”

Arya
could
not
lie
to
him.
She
lowered
her
eyes.

Lord
Eddard
Stark
sighed.
“My
nine-year-old
daughter
is
being
armed
from
my
own
forge,
and
I
know
nothing
of
it.
The
Hand
of
the
King
is
expected
to
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
yet
it
seems
I
cannot
even
rule
my
own
household.
How
is
it
that
you
come
to
own
a
sword,
Arya?
Where
did
you
get
this?”

Arya
chewed
her
lip
and
said
nothing.
She
would
not
betray
Jon,
not
even
to
their
father.

After
a
while,
Father
said,
“I
don’t
suppose
it
matters,
truly.”
He
looked
down
gravely
at
the
sword
in
his
hands.
“This
is
no
toy
for
children,
least
of
all
for
a
girl.
What
would
Septa
Mordane
say
if
she
knew
you
were
playing
with
swords?”

“I
wasn’t
playing,”
Arya
insisted.
“I
hate
Septa
Mordane.”

“That’s
enough.”
Her
father’s
voice
was
curt
and
hard.
“The
septa
is
doing
no
more
than
is
her
duty,
though
gods
know
you
have
made
it
a
struggle
for
the
poor
woman.
Your
mother
and
I
have
charged
her
with
the
impossible
task
of
making
you
a
lady.”

“I
don’t
want
to
be
a
lady!”
Arya
flared.

“I
ought
to
snap
this
toy
across
my
knee
here
and
now,
and
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense.”

“Needle
wouldn’t
break,”
Arya
said
defiantly,
but
her
voice
betrayed
her
words.

“It
has
a
name,
does
it?”
Her
father
sighed.
“Ah,
Arya.
You
have
a
wildness
in
you,
child.
‘The
wolf
blood,’
my
father
used
to
call
it.
Lyanna
had
a
touch
of
it,
and
my
brother
Brandon
more
than
a
touch.
It
brought
them
both
to
an
early
grave.”
Arya
heard
sadness
in
his
voice;
he
did
not
often
speak
of
his
father,
or
of
the
brother
and
sister
who
had
died
before
she
was
born.
“Lyanna
might
have
carried
a
sword,
if
my
lord
father
had
allowed
it.
You
remind
me
of
her
sometimes.
You
even
look
like
her.”

“Lyanna
was
beautiful,”
Arya
said,
startled.
Everybody
said
so.
It
was
not
a
thing
that
was
ever
said
of
Arya.

“She
was,”
Eddard
Stark
agreed,
“beautiful,
and
willful,
and
dead
before
her
time.”
He
lifted
the
sword,
held
it
out
between
them.
“Arya,
what
did
you
think
to
do
with
this…
Needle?
Who
did
you
hope
to
skewer?
Your
sister?
Septa
Mordane?
Do
you
know
the
first
thing
about
sword
fighting?”

All
she
could
think
of
was
the
lesson
Jon
had
given
her.
“Stick
them
with
the
pointy
end,”
she
blurted
out.

Her
father
snorted
back
laughter.
“That
is
the
essence
of
it,
I
suppose.”

Arya
desperately
wanted
to
explain,
to
make
him
see.
“I
was
trying
to
learn,
but…”
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“I
asked
Mycah
to
practice
with
me.”
The
grief
came
on
her
all
at
once.
She
turned
away,
shaking.
“I
asked
him,”
she
cried.
“It
was
my
fault,
it
was
me…”

Suddenly
her
father’s
arms
were
around
her.
He
held
her
gently
as
she
turned
to
him
and
sobbed
against
his
chest.
“No,
sweet
one,”
he
murmured.
“Grieve
for
your
friend,
but
never
blame
yourself.
You
did
not
kill
the
butcher’s
boy.
That
murder
lies
at
the
Hound’s
door,
him
and
the
cruel
woman
he
serves.”

“I
hate
them,”
Arya
confided,
red-faced,
sniffling.
“The
Hound
and
the
queen
and
the
king
and
Prince
Joffrey.
I
hate
all
of
them.
Joffrey
lied,
it
wasn’t
the
way
he
said.
I
hate
Sansa
too.
She
did
remember,
she
just
lied
so
Joffrey
would
like
her.”

“We
all
lie,”
her
father
said.
“Or
did
you
truly
think
I’d
believe
that
Nymeria
ran
off?”

Arya
blushed
guiltily.
“Jory
promised
not
to
tell.”

“Jory
kept
his
word,”
her
father
said
with
a
smile.
“There
are
some
things
I
do
not
need
to
be
told.
Even
a
blind
man
could
see
that
wolf
would
never
have
left
you
willingly.”

“We
had
to
throw
rocks,”
she
said
miserably.
“I
told
her
to
run,
to
go
be
free,
that
I
didn’t
want
her
anymore.
There
were
other
wolves
for
her
to
play
with,
we
heard
them
howling,
and
Jory
said
the
woods
were
full
of
game,
so
she’d
have
deer
to
hunt.
Only
she
kept
following,
and
finally
we
had
to
throw
rocks.
I
hit
her
twice.
She
whined
and
looked
at
me
and
I
felt
so
’shamed,
but
it
was
right,
wasn’t
it?
The
queen
would
have
killed
her.”

“It
was
right,”
her
father
said.
“And
even
the
lie
was…
not
without
honor.”
He’d
put
Needle
aside
when
he
went
to
Arya
to
embrace
her.
Now
he
took
the
blade
up
again
and
walked
to
the
window,
where
he
stood
for
a
moment,
looking
out
across
the
courtyard.
When
he
turned
back,
his
eyes
were
thoughtful.
He
seated
himself
on
the
window
seat,
Needle
across
his
lap.
“Arya,
sit
down.
I
need
to
try
and
explain
some
things
to
you.”

She
perched
anxiously
on
the
edge
of
her
bed.
“You
are
too
young
to
be
burdened
with
all
my
cares,”
he
told
her,
“but
you
are
also
a
Stark
of
Winterfell.
You
know
our
words.”

“Winter
is
coming,”
Arya
whispered.

“The
hard
cruel
times,”
her
father
said.
“We
tasted
them
on
the
Trident,
child,
and
when
Bran
fell.
You
were
born
in
the
long
summer,
sweet
one,
you’ve
never
known
anything
else,
but
now
the
winter
is
truly
coming.
Remember
the
sigil
of
our
House,
Arya.”

“The
direwolf,”
she
said,
thinking
of
Nymeria.
She
hugged
her
knees
against
her
chest,
suddenly
afraid.

“Let
me
tell
you
something
about
wolves,
child.
When
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies,
but
the
pack
survives.
Summer
is
the
time
for
squabbles.
In
winter,
we
must
protect
one
another,
keep
each
other
warm,
share
our
strengths.
So
if
you
must
hate,
Arya,
hate
those
who
would
truly
do
us
harm.
Septa
Mordane
is
a
good
woman,
and
Sansa…
Sansa
is
your
sister.
You
may
be
as
different
as
the
sun
and
the
moon,
but
the
same
blood
flows
through
both
your
hearts.
You
need
her,
as
she
needs
you…
and
I
need
both
of
you,
gods
help
me.”

He
sounded
so
tired
that
it
made
Arya
sad.
“I
don’t
hate
Sansa,”
she
told
him.
“Not
truly.”
It
was
only
half
a
lie.

“I
do
not
mean
to
frighten
you,
but
neither
will
I
lie
to
you.
We
have
come
to
a
dark
dangerous
place,
child.
This
is
not
Winterfell.
We
have
enemies
who
mean
us
ill.
We
cannot
fight
a
war
among
ourselves.
This
willfulness
of
yours,
the
running
off,
the
angry
words,
the
disobedience…
at
home,
these
were
only
the
summer
games
of
a
child.
Here
and
now,
with
winter
soon
upon
us,
that
is
a
different
matter.
It
is
time
to
begin
growing
up.”

“I
will,”
Arya
vowed.
She
had
never
loved
him
so
much
as
she
did
in
that
instant.
“I
can
be
strong
too.
I
can
be
as
strong
as
Robb.”

He
held
Needle
out
to
her,
hilt
first.
“Here.”

She
looked
at
the
sword
with
wonder
in
her
eyes.
For
a
moment
she
was
afraid
to
touch
it,
afraid
that
if
she
reached
for
it
it
would
be
snatched
away
again,
but
then
her
father
said,
“Go
on,
it’s
yours,”
and
she
took
it
in
her
hand.

“I
can
keep
it?”
she
said.
“For
true?”

“For
true.”
He
smiled.
“If
I
took
it
away,
no
doubt
I’d
find
a
morningstar
hidden
under
your
pillow
within
the
fortnight.
Try
not
to
stab
your
sister,
whatever
the
provocation.”

“I
won’t.
I
promise.”
Arya
clutched
Needle
tightly
to
her
chest
as
her
father
took
his
leave.

The
next
morning,
as
they
broke
their
fast,
she
apologized
to
Septa
Mordane
and
asked
for
her
pardon.
The
septa
peered
at
her
suspiciously,
but
Father
nodded.

Three
days
later,
at
midday,
her
father’s
steward
Vayon
Poole
sent
Arya
to
the
Small
Hall.
The
trestle
tables
had
been
dismantled
and
the
benches
shoved
against
the
walls.
The
hall
seemed
empty,
until
an
unfamiliar
voice
said,
“You
are
late,
boy.”
A
slight
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
stepped
out
of
the
shadows,
holding
a
pair
of
slender
wooden
swords.
“Tomorrow
you
will
be
here
at
midday.”
He
had
an
accent,
the
lilt
of
the
Free
Cities,
Braavos
perhaps,
or
Myr.

“Who
are
you?”
Arya
asked.

“I
am
your
dancing
master.”
He
tossed
her
one
of
the
wooden
blades.
She
grabbed
for
it,
missed,
and
heard
it
clatter
to
the
floor.
“Tomorrow
you
will
catch
it.
Now
pick
it
up.”

It
was
not
just
a
stick,
but
a
true
wooden
sword
complete
with
grip
and
guard
and
pommel.
Arya
picked
it
up
and
clutched
it
nervously
with
both
hands,
holding
it
out
in
front
of
her.
It
was
heavier
than
it
looked,
much
heavier
than
Needle.

The
bald
man
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“That
is
not
the
way,
boy.
This
is
not
a
greatsword
that
is
needing
two
hands
to
swing
it.
You
will
take
the
blade
in
one
hand.”

“It’s
too
heavy,”
Arya
said.

“It
is
heavy
as
it
needs
to
be
to
make
you
strong,
and
for
the
balancing.
A
hollow
inside
is
filled
with
lead,
just
so.
One
hand
now
is
all
that
is
needing.”

Arya
took
her
right
hand
off
the
grip
and
wiped
her
sweaty
palm
on
her
pants.
She
held
the
sword
in
her
left
hand.
He
seemed
to
approve.
“The
left
is
good.
All
is
reversed,
it
will
make
your
enemies
more
awkward.
Now
you
are
standing
wrong.
Turn
your
body
sideface,
yes,
so.
You
are
skinny
as
the
shaft
of
a
spear,
do
you
know.
That
is
good
too,
the
target
is
smaller.
Now
the
grip.
Let
me
see.”
He
moved
closer
and
peered
at
her
hand,
prying
her
fingers
apart,
rearranging
them.
“Just
so,
yes.
Do
not
squeeze
it
so
tight,
no,
the
grip
must
be
deft,
delicate.”

“What
if
I
drop
it?”
Arya
said.

“The
steel
must
be
part
of
your
arm,”
the
bald
man
told
her.
“Can
you
drop
part
of
your
arm?
No.
Nine
years
Syrio
Forel
was
first
sword
to
the
Sealord
of
Braavos,
he
knows
these
things.
Listen
to
him,
boy.”

It
was
the
third
time
he
had
called
her
“boy.”
“I’m
a
girl,”
Arya
objected.

“Boy,
girl,”
Syrio
Forel
said.
“You
are
a
sword,
that
is
all.”
He
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“Just
so,
that
is
the
grip.
You
are
not
holding
a
battle-axe,
you
are
holding
a—”

“—needle,”
Arya
finished
for
him,
fiercely.

“Just
so.
Now
we
will
begin
the
dance.
Remember,
child,
this
is
not
the
iron
dance
of
Westeros
we
are
learning,
the
knight’s
dance,
hacking
and
hammering,
no.
This
is
the
bravo’s
dance,
the
water
dance,
swift
and
sudden.
All
men
are
made
of
water,
do
you
know
this?
When
you
pierce
them,
the
water
leaks
out
and
they
die.”
He
took
a
step
backward,
raised
his
own
wooden
blade.
“Now
you
will
try
to
strike
me.”

Arya
tried
to
strike
him.
She
tried
for
four
hours,
until
every
muscle
in
her
body
was
sore
and
aching,
while
Syrio
Forel
clicked
his
teeth
together
and
told
her
what
to
do.

The
next
day
their
real
work
began.





DAENERYS

“The
Dothraki
sea,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said
as
he
reined
to
a
halt
beside
her
on
the
top
of
the
ridge.
beneath
them,
the
plain
stretched
out
immense
and
empty,
a
vast
flat
expanse
that
reached
to
the
distant
horizon
and
beyond.
It
was
a
sea,
Dany
thought.
Past
here,
there
were
no
hills,
no
mountains,
no
trees
nor
cities
nor
roads,
only
the
endless
grasses,
the
tall
blades
rippling
like
waves
when
the
winds
blew.
“It’s
so
green,”
she
said.

“Here
and
now,”
Ser
Jorah
agreed.
“You
ought
to
see
it
when
it
blooms,
all
dark
red
flowers
from
horizon
to
horizon,
like
a
sea
of
blood.
Come
the
dry
season,
and
the
world
turns
the
color
of
old
bronze.
And
this
is
only
hranna,
child.
There
are
a
hundred
kinds
of
grass
out
there,
grasses
as
yellow
as
lemon
and
as
dark
as
indigo,
blue
grasses
and
orange
grasses
and
grasses
like
rainbows.
Down
in
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai,
they
say
there
are
oceans
of
ghost
grass,
taller
than
a
man
on
horseback
with
stalks
as
pale
as
milkglass.
It
murders
all
other
grass
and
glows
in
the
dark
with
the
spirits
of
the
damned.
The
Dothraki
claim
that
someday
ghost
grass
will
cover
the
entire
world,
and
then
all
life
will
end.”

That
thought
gave
Dany
the
shivers.
“I
don’t
want
to
talk
about
that
now,”
she
said.
“It’s
so
beautiful
here,
I
don’t
want
to
think
about
everything
dying.”

“As
you
will,
Khaleesi,”
Ser
Jorah
said
respectfully.

She
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
turned
to
look
behind
her.
She
and
Mormont
had
outdistanced
the
rest
of
their
party,
and
now
the
others
were
climbing
the
ridge
below
them.
Her
handmaid
Irri
and
the
young
archers
of
her
khas
were
fluid
as
centaurs,
but
Viserys
still
struggled
with
the
short
stirrups
and
the
flat
saddle.
Her
brother
was
miserable
out
here.
He
ought
never
have
come.
Magister
Illyrio
had
urged
him
to
wait
in
Pentos,
had
offered
him
the
hospitality
of
his
manse,
but
Viserys
would
have
none
of
it.
He
would
stay
with
Drogo
until
the
debt
had
been
paid,
until
he
had
the
crown
he
had
been
promised.
“And
if
he
tries
to
cheat
me,
he
will
learn
to
his
sorrow
what
it
means
to
wake
the
dragon,”
Viserys
had
vowed,
laying
a
hand
on
his
borrowed
sword.
Illyrio
had
blinked
at
that
and
wished
him
good
fortune.

Dany
realized
that
she
did
not
want
to
listen
to
any
of
her
brother’s
complaints
right
now.
The
day
was
too
perfect.
The
sky
was
a
deep
blue,
and
high
above
them
a
hunting
hawk
circled.
The
grass
sea
swayed
and
sighed
with
each
breath
of
wind,
the
air
was
warm
on
her
face,
and
Dany
felt
at
peace.
She
would
not
let
Viserys
spoil
it.

“Wait
here,”
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah.
“Tell
them
all
to
stay.
Tell
them
I
command
it.”

The
knight
smiled.
Ser
Jorah
was
not
a
handsome
man.
He
had
a
neck
and
shoulders
like
a
bull,
and
coarse
black
hair
covered
his
arms
and
chest
so
thickly
that
there
was
none
left
for
his
head.
Yet
his
smiles
gave
Dany
comfort.
“You
are
learning
to
talk
like
a
queen,
Daenerys.”

“Not
a
queen,”
said
Dany.
“A
khaleesi.”
She
wheeled
her
horse
about
and
galloped
down
the
ridge
alone.

The
descent
was
steep
and
rocky,
but
Dany
rode
fearlessly,
and
the
joy
and
the
danger
of
it
were
a
song
in
her
heart.
All
her
life
Viserys
had
told
her
she
was
a
princess,
but
not
until
she
rode
her
silver
had
Daenerys
Targaryen
ever
felt
like
one.

At
first
it
had
not
come
easy.
The
khalasar
had
broken
camp
the
morning
after
her
wedding,
moving
east
toward
Vaes
Dothrak,
and
by
the
third
day
Dany
thought
she
was
going
to
die.
Saddle
sores
opened
on
her
bottom,
hideous
and
bloody.
Her
thighs
were
chafed
raw,
her
hands
blistered
from
the
reins,
the
muscles
of
her
legs
and
back
so
wracked
with
pain
that
she
could
scarcely
sit.
By
the
time
dusk
fell,
her
handmaids
would
need
to
help
her
down
from
her
mount.

Even
the
nights
brought
no
relief.
Khal
Drogo
ignored
her
when
they
rode,
even
as
he
had
ignored
her
during
their
wedding,
and
spent
his
evenings
drinking
with
his
warriors
and
bloodriders,
racing
his
prize
horses,
watching
women
dance
and
men
die.
Dany
had
no
place
in
these
parts
of
his
life.
She
was
left
to
sup
alone,
or
with
Ser
Jorah
and
her
brother,
and
afterward
to
cry
herself
to
sleep.
Yet
every
night,
some
time
before
the
dawn,
Drogo
would
come
to
her
tent
and
wake
her
in
the
dark,
to
ride
her
as
relentlessly
as
he
rode
his
stallion.
He
always
took
her
from
behind,
Dothraki
fashion,
for
which
Dany
was
grateful;
that
way
her
lord
husband
could
not
see
the
tears
that
wet
her
face,
and
she
could
use
her
pillow
to
muffle
her
cries
of
pain.
When
he
was
done,
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
begin
to
snore
softly
and
Dany
would
lie
beside
him,
her
body
bruised
and
sore,
hurting
too
much
for
sleep.

Day
followed
day,
and
night
followed
night,
until
Dany
knew
she
could
not
endure
a
moment
longer.
She
would
kill
herself
rather
than
go
on,
she
decided
one
night…

Yet
when
she
slept
that
night,
she
dreamt
the
dragon
dream
again.
Viserys
was
not
in
it
this
time.
There
was
only
her
and
the
dragon.
Its
scales
were
black
as
night,
wet
and
slick
with
blood.
Her
blood,
Dany
sensed.
Its
eyes
were
pools
of
molten
magma,
and
when
it
opened
its
mouth,
the
flame
came
roaring
out
in
a
hot
jet.
She
could
hear
it
singing
to
her,
She
opened
her
arms
to
the
fire,
embraced
it,
let
it
swallow
her
whole,
let
it
cleanse
her
and
temper
her
and
scour
her
clean.
She
could
feel
her
flesh
sear
and
blacken
and
slough
away,
could
feel
her
blood
boil
and
turn
to
steam,
and
yet
there
was
no
pain.
She
felt
strong
and
new
and
fierce.

And
the
next
day,
strangely,
she
did
not
seem
to
hurt
quite
so
much.
It
was
as
if
the
gods
had
heard
her
and
taken
pity.
Even
her
handmaids
noticed
the
change.
“Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
said,
“what
is
wrong?
Are
you
sick?”

“I
was,”
she
answered,
standing
over
the
dragon’s
eggs
that
Illyrio
had
given
her
when
she
wed.
She
touched
one,
the
largest
of
the
three,
running
her
hand
lightly
over
the
shelf.
Black-and-scarlet,
she
thought,
like
the
dragon
in
my
dream.
The
stone
felt
strangely
warm
beneath
her
fingers…
or
was
she
still
dreaming?
She
pulled
her
hand
back
nervously.

From
that
hour
onward,
each
day
was
easier
than
the
one
before
it.
Her
legs
grew
stronger;
her
blisters
burst
and
her
hands
grew
callused;
her
soft
thighs
toughened,
supple
as
leather.

The
khal
had
commanded
the
handmaid
Irri
to
teach
Dany
to
ride
in
the
Dothraki
fashion,
but
it
was
the
filly
who
was
her
real
teacher.
The
horse
seemed
to
know
her
moods,
as
if
they
shared
a
single
mind.
With
every
passing
day,
Dany
felt
surer
in
her
seat.
The
Dothraki
were
a
hard
and
unsentimental
people,
and
it
was
not
their
custom
to
name
their
animals,
so
Dany
thought
of
her
only
as
the
silver.
She
had
never
loved
anything
so
much.

As
the
riding
became
less
an
ordeal,
Dany
began
to
notice
the
beauties
of
the
land
around
her.
She
rode
at
the
head
of
the
khalasar
with
Drogo
and
his
bloodriders,
so
she
came
to
each
country
fresh
and
unspoiled.
Behind
them
the
great
horde
might
tear
the
earth
and
muddy
the
rivers
and
send
up
clouds
of
choking
dust,
but
the
fields
ahead
of
them
were
always
green
and
verdant.

They
crossed
the
rolling
hills
of
Norvos,
past
terraced
farms
and
small
villages
where
the
townsfolk
watched
anxiously
from
atop
white
stucco
walls.
They
forded
three
wide
placid
rivers
and
a
fourth
that
was
swift
and
narrow
and
treacherous,
camped
beside
a
high
blue
waterfall,
skirted
the
tumbled
ruins
of
a
vast
dead
city
where
ghosts
were
said
to
moan
among
blackened
marble
columns.
They
raced
down
Valyrian
roads
a
thousand
years
old
and
straight
as
a
Dothraki
arrow.
For
half
a
moon,
they
rode
through
the
Forest
of
Qohor,
where
the
leaves
made
a
golden
canopy
high
above
them,
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
were
as
wide
as
city
gates.
There
were
great
elk
in
that
wood,
and
spotted
tigers,
and
lemurs
with
silver
fur
and
huge
purple
eyes,
but
all
fled
before
the
approach
of
the
khalasar
and
Dany
got
no
glimpse
of
them.

By
then
her
agony
was
a
fading
memory.
She
still
ached
after
a
long
day’s
riding,
yet
somehow
the
pain
had
a
sweetness
to
it
now,
and
each
morning
she
came
willingly
to
her
saddle,
eager
to
know
what
wonders
waited
for
her
in
the
lands
ahead.
She
began
to
find
pleasure
even
in
her
nights,
and
if
she
still
cried
out
when
Drogo
took
her,
it
was
not
always
in
pain.

At
the
bottom
of
the
ridge,
the
grasses
rose
around
her,
tall
and
supple.
Dany
slowed
to
a
trot
and
rode
out
onto
the
plain,
losing
herself
in
the
green,
blessedly
alone.
In
the
khalasar
she
was
never
alone.
Khal
Drogo
came
to
her
only
after
the
sun
went
down,
but
her
handmaids
fed
her
and
bathed
her
and
slept
by
the
door
of
her
tent,
Drogo’s
bloodriders
and
the
men
of
her
khas
were
never
far,
and
her
brother
was
an
unwelcome
shadow,
day
and
night.
Dany
could
hear
him
on
the
top
of
the
ridge,
his
voice
shrill
with
anger
as
he
shouted
at
Ser
Jorah.
She
rode
on,
submerging
herself
deeper
in
the
Dothraki
sea.

The
green
swallowed
her
up.
The
air
was
rich
with
the
scents
of
earth
and
grass,
mixed
with
the
smell
of
horseflesh
and
Dany’s
sweat
and
the
oil
in
her
hair.
Dothraki
smells.
They
seemed
to
belong
here.
Dany
breathed
it
all
in,
laughing.
She
had
a
sudden
urge
to
feel
the
ground
beneath
her,
to
curl
her
toes
in
that
thick
black
soil.
Swinging
down
from
her
saddle,
she
let
the
silver
graze
while
she
pulled
off
her
high
boots.

Viserys
came
upon
her
as
sudden
as
a
summer
storm,
his
horse
rearing
beneath
him
as
he
reined
up
too
hard.
“You
dare!”
he
screamed
at
her.
“You
give
commands
to
me?
To
me?”
He
vaulted
off
the
horse,
stumbling
as
he
landed.
His
face
was
flushed
as
he
struggled
back
to
his
feet.
He
grabbed
her,
shook
her.
“Have
you
forgotten
who
you
are?
Look
at
you.
Look
at
you!”

Dany
did
not
need
to
look.
She
was
barefoot,
with
oiled
hair,
wearing
Dothraki
riding
leathers
and
a
painted
vest
given
her
as
a
bride
gift.
She
looked
as
though
she
belonged
here.
Viserys
was
soiled
and
stained
in
city
silks
and
ringmail.

He
was
still
screaming.
“You
do
not
command
the
dragon.
Do
you
understand?
I
am
the
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
I
will
not
hear
orders
from
some
horselord’s
slut,
do
you
hear
me?”
His
hand
went
under
her
vest,
his
fingers
digging
painfully
into
her
breast.
“Do
you
hear
me?”

Dany
shoved
him
away,
hard.

Viserys
stared
at
her,
his
lilac
eyes
incredulous.
She
had
never
defied
him.
Never
fought
back.
Rage
twisted
his
features.
He
would
hurt
her
now,
and
badly,
she
knew
that.

Crack.

The
whip
made
a
sound
like
thunder.
The
coil
took
Viserys
around
the
throat
and
yanked
him
backward.
He
went
sprawling
in
the
grass,
stunned
and
choking.
The
Dothraki
riders
hooted
at
him
as
he
struggled
to
free
himself.
The
one
with
the
whip,
young
Jhogo,
rasped
a
question.
Dany
did
not
understand
his
words,
but
by
then
Irri
was
there,
and
Ser
Jorah,
and
the
rest
of
her
khas.
“Jhogo
asks
if
you
would
have
him
dead,
Khaleesi,”
Irri
said.

“No,”
Dany
replied.
“No.”

Jhogo
understood
that.
One
of
the
others
barked
out
a
comment,
and
the
Dothraki
laughed.
Irri
told
her,
“Quaro
thinks
you
should
take
an
ear
to
teach
him
respect.”

Her
brother
was
on
his
knees,
his
fingers
digging
under
the
leather
coils,
crying
incoherently,
struggling
for
breath.
The
whip
was
tight
around
his
windpipe.

“Tell
them
I
do
not
wish
him
harmed,”
Dany
said.

Irri
repeated
her
words
in
Dothraki.
Jhogo
gave
a
pull
on
the
whip,
yanking
Viserys
around
like
a
puppet
on
a
string.
He
went
sprawling
again,
freed
from
the
leather
embrace,
a
thin
line
of
blood
under
his
chin
where
the
whip
had
cut
deep.

“I
warned
him
what
would
happen,
my
lady,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said.
“I
told
him
to
stay
on
the
ridge,
as
you
commanded.”

“I
know
you
did,”
Dany
replied,
watching
Viserys.
He
lay
on
the
ground,
sucking
in
air
noisily,
red-faced
and
sobbing.
He
was
a
pitiful
thing.
He
had
always
been
a
pitiful
thing.
Why
had
she
never
seen
that
before?
There
was
a
hollow
place
inside
her
where
her
fear
had
been.

“Take
his
horse,”
Dany
commanded
Ser
Jorah.
Viserys
gaped
at
her.
He
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing;
nor
could
Dany
quite
believe
what
she
was
saying.
Yet
the
words
came.
“Let
my
brother
walk
behind
us
back
to
the
khalasar.”
Among
the
Dothraki,
the
man
who
does
not
ride
was
no
man
at
all,
the
lowest
of
the
low,
without
honor
or
pride.
“Let
everyone
see
him
as
he
is.”

“No!”
Viserys
screamed.
He
turned
to
Ser
Jorah,
pleading
in
the
Common
Tongue
with
words
the
horsemen
would
not
understand.
“Hit
her,
Mormont.
Hurt
her.
Your
king
commands
it.
Kill
these
Dothraki
dogs
and
teach
her.”

The
exile
knight
looked
from
Dany
to
her
brother;
she
barefoot,
with
dirt
between
her
toes
and
oil
in
her
hair,
he
with
his
silks
and
steel.
Dany
could
see
the
decision
on
his
face.
“He
shall
walk,
Khaleesi,”
he
said.
He
took
her
brother’s
horse
in
hand
while
Dany
remounted
her
silver.

Viserys
gaped
at
him,
and
sat
down
in
the
dirt.
He
kept
his
silence,
>>>>>>> asd
but
he
would
not
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
be
far.
When
they
made
camp
for
the
night,
he’d
find
his
way
to
Jon
at
the
Lord
Commander’s
tent.

“Fishing,
I’d
call
it,
in
this
wet,”
Dywen
said.

“My
mother
always
said
rain
was
good
for
growing
crops,”
Grenn
put
in
hopefully.

“Aye,
a
good
crop
of
mildew,”
Dywen
said.
“The
best
thing
about
a
rain
like
this,
it
saves
a
man
from
taking
baths.”
He
made
a
clacking
sound
on
his
wooden
teeth.

“Buckwell’s
found
Craster,”
Jon
told
them.

“Had
he
lost
him?”
Dywen
chuckled.
“See
that
you
young
bucks
don’t
go
nosing
about
Craster’s
wives,
you
hear?”

Jon
smiled.
“Want
them
all
for
yourself,
Dywen?”

Dywen
clacked
his
teeth
some
more.
“Might
be
I
do.
Craster’s
got
ten
fingers
and
one
cock,
so
he
don’t
count
but
to
eleven.
He’d
never
miss
a
couple.”

“How
many
wives
does
he
have,
truly?”
Grenn
asked.

“More’n
you
ever
will,
brother.
Well,
it’s
not
so
hard
when
you
breed
your
own.
There’s
your
beast,
Snow.”

Ghost
was
trotting
along
beside
Jon’s
horse
with
tail
held
high,
his
white
fur
ruffed
up
thick
against
the
rain.
He
moved
so
silently
Jon
could
not
have
said
just
when
he
appeared.
Grenn’s
mount
shied
at
the
scent
of
him;
even
now,
after
more
than
a
year,
the
horses
were
uneasy
in
the
presence
of
the
direwolf.
“With
me,
Ghost.”
Jon
spurred
off
to
Craster’s
Keep.

He
had
never
thought
to
find
a
stone
castle
on
the
far
side
of
the
Wall,
but
he
had
pictured
some
sort
of
motte-and-bailey
with
a
wooden
palisade
and
a
timber
tower
keep.
What
they
found
instead
was
a
midden
heap,
a
pigsty,
an
empty
sheepfold,
and
a
windowless
daub-and-wattle
hall
scarce
worthy
of
the
name.
It
was
long
and
low,
chinked
together
from
logs
and
roofed
with
sod.
The
compound
stood
atop
a
rise
too
modest
to
name
a
hill,
surrounded
by
an
earthen
dike.
Brown
rivulets
flowed
down
the
slope
where
the
rain
had
eaten
gaping
holes
in
the
defenses,
to
join
a
rushing
brook
that
curved
around
to
the
north,
its
thick
waters
turned
into
a
murky
torrent
by
the
rains.

On
the
southwest,
he
found
an
open
gate
flanked
by
a
pair
of
animal
skulls
on
high
poles:
a
bear
to
one
side,
a
ram
to
the
other.
Bits
of
flesh
still
clung
to
the
bear
skull,
Jon
noted
as
he
joined
the
line
riding
past.
Within,
Jarmen
Buckwell’s
scouts
and
men
from
Thoren
Smallwood’s
van
were
setting
up
horse
lines
and
struggling
to
raise
tents.
A
host
of
piglets
rooted
about
three
huge
sows
in
the
sty.
Nearby,
a
small
girl
pulled
carrots
from
a
garden,
naked
in
the
rain,
while
two
women
tied
a
pig
for
slaughter.
The
animal’s
squeals
were
high
and
horrible,
almost
human
in
their
distress.
Chett’s
hounds
barked
wildly
in
answer,
snarling
and
snapping
despite
his
curses,
with
a
pair
of
Craster’s
dogs
barking
back.
When
they
saw
Ghost,
some
of
the
dogs
broke
off
and
ran,
while
others
began
to
bay
and
growl.
The
direwolf
ignored
them,
as
did
Jon.

Well,
thirty
of
us
will
be
warm
and
dry,
Jon
thought
once
he’d
gotten
a
good
look
at
the
hall.
Perhaps
as
many
as
fifty.
The
place
was
much
too
small
to
sleep
two
hundred
men,
so
most
would
need
to
remain
outside.
And
where
to
put
them?
The
rain
had
turned
half
the
compound
yard
to
ankle-deep
puddles
and
the
rest
to
sucking
mud.
Another
dismal
night
was
in
prospect.

The
Lord
Commander
had
entrusted
his
mount
to
Dolorous
Edd.
He
was
cleaning
mud
out
of
the
horse’s
hooves
as
Jon
dismounted.
“Lord
Mormont’s
in
the
hall,”
he
announced.
“He
said
for
you
to
join
him.
Best
leave
the
wolf
outside,
he
looks
hungry
enough
to
eat
one
of
Craster’s
children.
Well,
truth
be
told,
I’m
hungry
enough
to
eat
one
of
Craster’s
children,
so
long
as
he
was
served
hot.
Go
on,
I’ll
see
to
your
horse.
If
it’s
warm
and
dry
inside,
don’t
tell
me,
I
wasn’t
asked
in.”
He
flicked
a
glob
of
wet
mud
out
from
under
a
horseshoe.
“Does
this
mud
look
like
shit
to
you?
Could
it
be
that
this
whole
hill
is
made
of
Craster’s
shit?”

Jon
smiled.
“Well,
I
hear
he’s
been
here
a
long
time.”

“You
cheer
me
not.
Go
see
the
Old
Bear.”

“Ghost,
stay,”
he
commanded.
The
door
to
Craster’s
Keep
was
made
of
two
flaps
of
deerhide.
Jon
shoved
between
them,
stooping
to
pass
under
the
low
lintel.
Two
dozen
of
the
chief
rangers
had
preceded
him,
and
were
standing
around
the
firepit
in
the
center
of
the
dirt
floor
while
puddles
collected
about
their
boots.
The
hall
stank
of
soot,
dung,
and
wet
dog.
The
air
was
heavy
with
smoke,
yet
somehow
still
damp.
Rain
leaked
through
the
smoke
hole
in
the
roof.
It
was
all
a
single
room,
with
a
sleeping
loft
above
reached
by
a
pair
of
splintery
ladders.

Jon
remembered
how
he’d
felt
the
day
they
had
left
the
Wall:
nervous
as
a
maiden,
but
eager
to
glimpse
the
mysteries
and
wonders
beyond
each
new
horizon.
Well,
here’s
one
of
the
wonders,
he
told
himself,
gazing
about
the
squalid,
foul-smelling
hall.
The
acrid
smoke
was
making
his
eyes
water.
A
pity
that
Pyp
and
Toad
can’t
see
all
they’re
missing.

Craster
sat
above
the
fire,
the
only
man
to
enjoy
his
own
chair.
Even
Lord
Commander
Mormont
must
seat
himself
on
the
common
bench,
with
his
raven
muttering
on
his
shoulder.
Jarman
Buckwell
stood
behind,
dripping
from
patched
mail
and
shiny
wet
leather,
beside
Thoren
Smallwood
in
the
late
Ser
Jaremy’s
heavy
breastplate
and
sable-trimmed
cloak.

Craster’s
sheepskin
jerkin
and
cloak
of
sewn
skins
made
a
shabby
contrast,
but
around
one
thick
wrist
was
a
heavy
ring
that
had
the
glint
of
gold.
He
looked
to
be
a
powerful
man,
though
well
into
the
winter
of
his
days
now,
his
mane
of
hair
grey
going
to
white.
A
flat
nose
and
a
drooping
mouth
gave
him
a
cruel
look,
and
one
of
his
ears
was
missing.
So
this
is
a
wildling.
Jon
remembered
Old
Nan’s
tales
of
the
savage
folk
who
drank
blood
from
human
skulls.
Craster
seemed
to
be
drinking
a
thin
yellow
beer
from
a
chipped
stone
cup.
Perhaps
he
had
not
heard
the
stories.

“I’ve
not
seen
Benjen
Stark
for
three
years,”
he
was
telling
Mormont.
“And
if
truth
be
told,
I
never
once
missed
him.”
A
half-dozen
black
puppies
and
the
odd
pig
or
two
skulked
among
the
benches,
while
women
in
ragged
deerskins
passed
horns
of
beer,
stirred
the
fire,
and
chopped
carrots
and
onions
into
a
kettle.

“He
ought
to
have
passed
here
last
year,”
said
Thoren
Smallwood.
A
dog
came
sniffing
round
his
leg.
He
kicked
it
and
sent
it
off
yipping.

Lord
Mormont
said,
“Ben
was
searching
for
Ser
Waymar
Royce,
who’d
vanished
with
Gared
and
young
Will.”

“Aye,
those
three
I
recall.
The
lordling
no
older
than
one
of
these
pups.
Too
proud
to
sleep
under
my
roof,
him
in
his
sable
cloak
and
black
steel.
My
wives
give
him
big
cow
eyes
all
the
same.”
He
turned
his
squint
on
the
nearest
of
the
women.
“Gared
says
they
were
chasing
raiders.
I
told
him,
with
a
commander
that
green,
best
not
catch
’em.
Gared
wasn’t
half-bad,
for
a
crow.
Had
less
ears
than
me,
that
one.
The
’bite
took
’em,
same
as
mine.”
Craster
laughed.
“Now
I
hear
he
got
no
head
neither.
The
’bite
do
that
too?”

Jon
remembered
a
spray
of
red
blood
on
white
snow,
and
the
way
Theon
Greyjoy
had
kicked
the
dead
man’s
head.
The
man
was
a
deserter.
On
the
way
back
to
Winterfell,
Jon
and
Robb
had
raced,
and
found
six
direwolf
pups
in
the
snow.
A
thousand
years
ago.

“When
Ser
Waymar
left
you,
where
was
he
bound?”

Craster
gave
a
shrug.
“Happens
I
have
better
things
to
do
than
tend
to
the
comings
and
goings
of
crows.”
He
drank
a
pull
of
beer
and
set
the
cup
aside.
“Had
no
good
southron
wine
up
here
for
a
bear’s
night.
I
could
use
me
some
wine,
and
a
new
axe.
Mine’s
lost
its
bite,
can’t
have
that,
I
got
me
women
to
protect.”
He
gazed
around
at
his
scurrying
wives.

“You
are
few
here,
and
isolated,”
Mormont
said.
“If
you
like,
I’ll
detail
some
men
to
escort
you
south
to
the
Wall.”

The
raven
seemed
to
like
the
notion.
“Wall,”
it
screamed,
spreading
black
wings
like
a
high
collar
behind
Mormont’s
head.

Their
host
gave
a
nasty
smile,
showing
a
mouthful
of
broken
brown
teeth.
“And
what
would
we
do
there,
serve
you
at
supper?
We’re
free
folk
here.
Craster
serves
no
man.”

“These
are
bad
times
to
dwell
alone
in
the
wild.
The
cold
winds
are
rising.”

“Let
them
rise.
My
roots
are
sunk
deep.”
Craster
grabbed
a
passing
woman
by
the
wrist.
“Tell
him,
wife.
Tell
the
Lord
Crow
how
well
content
we
are.”

The
woman
licked
at
thin
lips.
“This
is
our
place.
Craster
keeps
us
safe.
Better
to
die
free
than
live
a
slave.”

“Slave,”
muttered
the
raven.

Mormont
leaned
forward.
“Every
village
we
have
passed
has
been
abandoned.
Yours
are
the
first
living
faces
we’ve
seen
since
we
left
the
Wall.
The
people
are
gone…
whether
dead,
fled,
or
taken,
I
could
not
say.
The
animals
as
well.
Nothing
is
left.
And
earlier,
we
found
the
bodies
of
two
of
Ben
Stark’s
rangers
only
a
few
leagues
from
the
Wall.
They
were
pale
and
cold,
with
black
hands
and
black
feet
and
wounds
that
did
not
bleed.
Yet
when
we
took
them
back
to
Castle
Black
they
rose
in
the
night
and
killed.
One
slew
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
and
the
other
came
for
me,
which
tells
me
that
they
remember
some
of
what
they
knew
when
they
lived,
but
there
was
no
human
mercy
left
in
them.”

The
woman’s
mouth
hung
open,
a
wet
pink
cave,
but
Craster
only
gave
a
snort.
“We’ve
had
no
such
troubles
here…
and
I’ll
thank
you
not
to
tell
such
evil
tales
under
my
roof.
I’m
a
godly
man,
and
the
gods
keep
me
safe.
If
wights
come
walking,
I’ll
know
how
to
send
them
back
to
their
graves.
Though
I
could
use
me
a
sharp
new
axe.”
He
sent
his
wife
scurrying
with
a
slap
on
her
leg
and
a
shout
of
“More
beer,
and
be
quick
about
it.”

“No
trouble
from
the
dead,”
Jarmen
Buckwell
said,
“but
what
of
the
living,
my
lord?
What
of
your
king?”

“King!”
cried
Mormont’s
raven.
“King,
king,
king.”

“That
Mance
Rayder?”
Craster
spit
into
the
fire.
“King-beyond-the-Wall.
What
do
free
folk
want
with
kings?”
He
turned
his
squint
on
Mormont.
“There’s
much
I
could
tell
you
o’
Rayder
and
his
doings,
if
I
had
a
mind.
This
o’
the
empty
villages,
that’s
his
work.
You
would
have
found
this
hall
abandoned
as
well,
if
I
were
a
man
to
scrape
to
such.
He
sends
a
rider,
tells
me
I
must
leave
my
own
keep
to
come
grovel
at
his
feet.
I
sent
the
man
back,
but
kept
his
tongue.
It’s
nailed
to
that
wall
there.”
He
pointed.
“Might
be
that
I
could
tell
you
where
to
seek
Mance
Rayder.
If
I
had
a
mind.”
The
brown
smile
again.
“But
we’ll
have
time
enough
for
that.
You’ll
be
wanting
to
sleep
beneath
my
roof,
belike,
and
eat
me
out
of
pigs.”

“A
roof
would
be
most
welcome,
my
lord,”
Mormont
said.
“We’ve
had
hard
riding,
and
too
much
wet.”

“Then
you’ll
guest
here
for
a
night.
No
longer,
I’m
not
that
fond
o’
crows.
The
loft’s
for
me
and
mine,
but
you’ll
have
all
the
floor
you
like.
I’ve
meat
and
beer
for
twenty,
no
more.
The
rest
o’
your
black
crows
can
peck
after
their
own
corn.”

“We’ve
packed
in
our
own
supplies,
my
lord,”
said
the
Old
Bear.
“We
should
be
pleased
to
share
our
food
and
wine.”

Craster
wiped
his
drooping
mouth
with
the
back
of
a
hairy
hand.
“I’ll
taste
your
wine,
Lord
Crow,
that
I
will.
One
more
thing.
Any
man
lays
a
hand
on
my
wives,
he
loses
the
hand.”

“Your
roof,
your
rule,”
said
Thoren
Smallwood,
and
Lord
Mormont
nodded
stiffly,
though
he
looked
none
too
pleased.

“That’s
settled,
then.”
Craster
grudged
them
a
grunt.
“D’ya
have
a
man
can
draw
a
map?”

“Sam
Tarly
can.”
Jon
pushed
forward.
“Sam
loves
maps.”

Mormont
beckoned
him
closer.
“Send
him
here
after
he’s
eaten.
Have
him
bring
quill
and
parchment.
And
find
Tollett
as
well.
Tell
him
to
bring
my
axe.
A
guest
gift
for
our
host.”

“Who’s
this
one
now?”
Craster
said
before
Jon
could
go.
“He
has
the
look
of
a
Stark.”

“My
steward
and
squire,
Jon
Snow.”

“A
bastard,
is
it?”
Craster
looked
Jon
up
and
down.
“Man
wants
to
bed
a
woman,
seems
like
he
ought
to
take
her
to
wife.
That’s
what
I
do.”
He
shooed
Jon
off
with
a
wave.
“Well,
run
and
do
your
service,
bastard,
and
see
that
axe
is
good
and
sharp
now,
I’ve
no
use
for
dull
steel.”

Jon
Snow
bowed
stiffly
and
took
his
leave.
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
was
coming
in
as
he
was
leaving,
and
they
almost
collided
at
the
deerhide
door.
Outside,
the
rain
seemed
to
have
slackened.
Tents
had
gone
up
all
over
the
compound.
Jon
could
see
the
tops
of
others
under
the
trees.

Dolorous
Edd
was
feeding
the
horses.
“Give
the
wildling
an
axe,
why
not?”
He
pointed
out
Mormont’s
weapon,
a
short-hafted
battle-axe
with
gold
scrollwork
inlaid
on
the
black
steel
blade.
“He’ll
give
it
back,
I
vow.
Buried
in
the
Old
Bear’s
skull,
like
as
not.
Why
not
give
him
all
our
axes,
and
our
swords
as
well?
I
mislike
the
way
they
clank
and
rattle
as
we
ride.
We’d
travel
faster
without
them,
straight
to
hell’s
door.
Does
it
rain
in
hell,
I
wonder?
Perhaps
Craster
would
like
a
nice
hat
instead.”

Jon
smiled.
“He
wants
an
axe.
And
wine
as
well.”

“See,
the
Old
Bear’s
clever.
If
we
get
the
wildling
well
and
truly
drunk,
perhaps
he’ll
only
cut
off
an
ear
when
he
tries
to
slay
us
with
that
axe.
I
have
two
ears
but
only
one
head.”

“Smallwood
says
Craster
is
a
friend
to
the
Watch.”

“Do
you
know
the
difference
between
a
wildling
who’s
a
friend
to
the
Watch
and
one
who’s
not?”
asked
the
dour
squire.
“Our
enemies
leave
our
bodies
for
the
crows
and
the
wolves.
Our
friends
bury
us
in
secret
graves.
I
wonder
how
long
that
bear’s
been
nailed
up
on
that
gate,
and
what
Craster
had
there
before
we
came
hallooing?”
Edd
looked
at
the
axe
doubtfully,
the
rain
running
down
his
long
face.
“Is
it
dry
in
there?”

“Drier
than
out
here.”

“If
I
lurk
about
after,
not
too
close
to
the
fire,
belike
they’ll
take
no
note
of
me
till
morn.
The
ones
under
his
roof
will
be
the
first
he
murders,
but
at
least
we’ll
die
dry.”

Jon
had
to
laugh.
“Craster’s
one
man.
We’re
two
hundred.
I
doubt
he’ll
murder
anyone.”

“You
cheer
me,”
said
Edd,
sounding
utterly
morose.
“And
besides,
there’s
much
to
be
said
for
a
good
sharp
axe.
I’d
hate
to
be
murdered
with
a
maul.
I
saw
a
man
hit
in
the
brow
with
a
maul
once.
Scarce
split
the
skin
at
all,
but
his
head
turned
mushy
and
swelled
up
big
as
a
gourd,
only
purply-red.
A
comely
man,
but
he
died
ugly.
It’s
good
that
we’re
not
giving
them
mauls.”
Edd
walked
away
shaking
his
head,
his
sodden
black
cloak
shedding
rain
behind
him.

Jon
got
the
horses
fed
before
he
stopped
to
think
of
his
own
supper.
He
was
wondering
where
to
find
Sam
when
he
heard
a
shout
of
fear.
“Wolf!”
He
sprinted
around
the
hall
toward
the
cry,
the
earth
sucking
at
his
boots.
One
of
Craster’s
women
was
backed
up
against
the
mud-spattered
wall
of
the
keep.
“Keep
away,”
she
was
shouting
at
Ghost.
“You
keep
away!”
The
direwolf
had
a
rabbit
in
his
mouth
and
another
dead
and
bloody
on
the
ground
before
him.
“Get
it
away,
m’lord,”
she
pleaded
when
she
saw
him.

“He
won’t
hurt
you.”
He
knew
at
once
what
had
happened;
a
wooden
hutch,
its
slats
shattered,
lay
on
its
side
in
the
wet
grass.
“He
must
have
been
hungry.
We
haven’t
seen
much
game.”
Jon
whistled.
The
direwolf
bolted
down
the
rabbit,
crunching
the
small
bones
between
his
teeth,
and
padded
over
to
him.

The
woman
regarded
them
with
nervous
eyes.
She
was
younger
than
he’d
thought
at
first.
A
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years,
he
judged,
dark
hair
plastered
across
a
gaunt
face
by
the
falling
rain,
her
bare
feet
muddy
to
the
ankles.
The
body
under
the
sewn
skins
was
showing
in
the
early
turns
of
pregnancy.
“Are
you
one
of
Craster’s
daughters?”
he
asked.

She
put
a
hand
over
her
belly.
“Wife
now.”
Edging
away
from
the
wolf,
she
knelt
mournfully
beside
the
broken
hutch.
“I
was
going
to
breed
them
rabbits.
There’s
no
sheep
left.”

“The
Watch
will
make
good
for
them.”
Jon
had
no
coin
of
his
own,
or
he
would
have
offered
it
to
her…
though
he
was
not
sure
what
good
a
few
coppers
or
even
a
silver
piece
would
do
her
beyond
the
Wall.
“I’ll
speak
to
Lord
Mormont
on
the
morrow.”

She
wiped
her
hands
on
her
skirt.
“M’lord—”

“I’m
no
lord.”

But
others
had
come
crowding
round,
drawn
by
the
woman’s
scream
and
the
crash
of
the
rabbit
hutch.
“Don’t
you
believe
him,
girl,”
called
out
Lark
the
Sisterman,
a
ranger
mean
as
a
cur.
“That’s
Lord
Snow
himself.”

“Bastard
of
Winterfell
and
brother
to
kings,”
mocked
Chett,
who’d
left
his
hounds
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
about.

“That
wolf’s
looking
at
you
hungry,
girl,”
Lark
said.
“Might
be
it
fancies
that
tender
bit
in
your
belly.”

Jon
was
not
amused.
“You’re
scaring
her.”

“Warning
her,
more
like.”
Chett’s
grin
was
as
ugly
as
the
boils
that
covered
most
of
his
face.

“We’re
not
to
talk
to
you,”
the
girl
remembered
suddenly.

“Wait,”
Jon
said,
too
late.
She
bolted,
ran.

Lark
made
a
grab
for
the
second
rabbit,
but
Ghost
was
quicker.
When
he
bared
his
teeth,
the
Sisterman
slipped
in
the
mud
and
went
down
on
his
bony
butt.
The
others
laughed.
The
direwolf
took
the
rabbit
in
his
mouth
and
brought
it
to
Jon.

“There
was
no
call
to
scare
the
girl,”
he
told
them.

“We’ll
hear
no
scolds
from
you,
bastard.”
Chett
blamed
Jon
for
the
loss
of
his
comfortable
position
with
Maester
Aemon,
and
not
without
justice.
If
he
had
not
gone
to
Aemon
about
Sam
Tarly,
Chett
would
still
be
tending
an
old
blind
man
instead
of
a
pack
of
ill-tempered
hunting
hounds.
“You
may
be
the
Lord
Commander’s
pet,
but
you’re
not
the
Lord
Commander…
and
you
wouldn’t
talk
so
bloody
bold
without
that
monster
of
yours
always
about.”

“I’ll
not
fight
a
brother
while
we’re
beyond
the
Wall,”
Jon
answered,
his
voice
cooler
than
he
felt.

Lark
got
to
one
knee.
“He’s
afraid
of
you,
Chett.
On
the
Sisters,
we
have
a
name
for
them
like
him.”

“I
know
all
the
names.
Save
your
breath.”
He
walked
away,
Ghost
at
his
side.
The
rain
had
dwindled
to
a
thin
drizzle
by
the
time
he
reached
the
gate.
Dusk
would
be
on
them
soon,
followed
by
another
wet
dark
dismal
night.
The
clouds
would
hide
moon
and
stars
and
Mormont’s
Torch,
turning
the
woods
black
as
pitch.
Every
piss
would
be
an
adventure,
if
not
quite
of
the
sort
Jon
Snow
had
once
envisioned.

Out
under
the
trees,
some
rangers
had
found
enough
duff
and
dry
wood
to
start
a
fire
beneath
a
slanting
ridge
of
slate.
Others
had
raised
tents
or
made
rude
shelters
by
stretching
their
cloaks
over
low
branches.
Giant
had
crammed
himself
inside
the
hollow
of
a
dead
oak.
“How
d’ye
like
my
castle,
Lord
Snow?”

“It
looks
snug.
You
know
where
Sam
is?”

“Keep
on
the
way
you
were.
If
you
come
on
Ser
Ottyn’s
pavilion,
you’ve
gone
too
far.”
Giant
smiled.
“Unless
Sam’s
found
him
a
tree
too.
What
a
tree
that
would
be.”

It
was
Ghost
who
found
Sam
in
the
end.
The
direwolf
shot
ahead
like
a
quarrel
from
a
crossbow.
Under
an
outcrop
of
rock
that
gave
some
small
degree
of
shelter
from
the
rain,
Sam
was
feeding
the
ravens.
His
boots
squished
when
he
moved.
“My
feet
are
soaked
through,”
he
admitted
miserably.
“When
I
climbed
off
my
horse,
I
stepped
in
a
hole
and
went
in
up
to
my
knees.”

“Take
off
your
boots
and
dry
your
stockings.
I’ll
find
some
dry
wood.
If
the
ground’s
not
wet
under
the
rock,
we
might
be
able
to
get
a
fire
burning.”
Jon
showed
Sam
the
rabbit.
“And
we’ll
feast.”

“Won’t
you
be
attending
Lord
Mormont
in
the
hall?”

“No,
but
you
will.
The
Old
Bear
wants
you
to
map
for
him.
Craster
says
he’ll
find
Mance
Rayder
for
us.”

“Oh.”
Sam
did
not
look
anxious
to
meet
Craster,
even
if
it
meant
a
warm
fire.

“He
said
eat
first,
though.
Dry
your
feet.”
Jon
went
to
gather
fuel,
digging
down
under
deadfalls
for
the
drier
wood
beneath
and
peeling
back
layers
of
sodden
pine
needles
until
he
found
likely
kindling.
Even
then,
it
seemed
to
take
forever
for
a
spark
to
catch.
He
hung
his
cloak
from
the
rock
to
keep
the
rain
off
his
smoky
little
fire,
making
them
a
small
snug
alcove.

As
he
knelt
to
skin
the
rabbit,
Sam
pulled
off
his
boots.
“I
think
there’s
moss
growing
between
my
toes,”
he
declared
mournfully,
wriggling
the
toes
in
question.
“The
rabbit
will
taste
good.
I
don’t
even
mind
about
the
blood
and
all.”
He
looked
away.
“Well,
only
a
little…”

Jon
spitted
the
carcass,
banked
the
fire
with
a
pair
of
rocks,
and
balanced
their
meal
atop
them.
The
rabbit
had
been
a
scrawny
thing,
but
as
it
cooked
it
smelled
like
a
king’s
feast.
Other
rangers
gave
them
envious
looks.
Even
Ghost
looked
up
hungrily,
flames
shining
in
his
red
eyes
as
he
sniffed.
“You
had
yours
before,”
Jon
reminded
him.

“Is
Craster
as
savage
as
the
rangers
say?”
Sam
asked.
The
rabbit
was
a
shade
underdone,
but
tasted
wonderful.
“What’s
his
castle
like?”

“A
midden
heap
with
a
roof
and
a
firepit.”
Jon
told
Sam
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
Craster’s
Keep.

By
the
time
the
telling
was
done,
it
was
dark
outside
and
Sam
was
licking
his
fingers.
“That
was
good,
but
now
I’d
like
a
leg
of
lamb.
A
whole
leg,
just
for
me,
sauced
with
mint
and
honey
and
cloves.
Did
you
see
any
lambs?”

“There
was
a
sheepfold,
but
no
sheep.”

“How
does
he
feed
all
his
men?”

“I
didn’t
see
any
men.
Just
Craster
and
his
women
and
a
few
small
girls.
I
wonder
he’s
able
to
hold
the
place.
His
defenses
were
nothing
to
speak
of,
only
a
muddy
dike.
You
had
better
go
up
to
the
hall
and
draw
that
map.
Can
you
find
the
way?”

“If
I
don’t
fall
in
the
mud.”
Sam
struggled
back
into
his
boots,
collected
quill
and
parchment,
and
shouldered
out
into
the
night,
the
rain
pattering
down
on
his
cloak
and
floppy
hat.

Ghost
laid
his
head
on
his
paws
and
went
to
sleep
by
the
fire.
Jon
stretched
out
beside
him,
grateful
for
the
warmth.
He
was
cold
and
wet,
but
not
so
cold
and
wet
as
he’d
been
a
short
time
before.
Perhaps
tonight
the
Old
Bear
will
learn
something
that
will
lead
us
to
Uncle
Benjen.

He
woke
to
the
sight
of
his
own
breath
misting
in
the
cold
morning
air.
When
he
moved,
his
bones
ached.
Ghost
was
gone,
the
fire
burnt
out.
Jon
reached
to
pull
aside
the
cloak
he’d
hung
over
the
rock,
and
found
it
stiff
and
frozen.
He
crept
beneath
it
and
stood
up
in
a
forest
turned
to
crystal.

The
pale
pink
light
of
dawn
sparkled
on
branch
and
leaf
and
stone.
Every
blade
of
grass
was
carved
from
emerald,
every
drip
of
water
turned
to
diamond.
Flowers
and
mushrooms
alike
wore
coats
of
glass.
Even
the
mud
puddles
had
a
bright
brown
sheen.
Through
the
shimmering
greenery,
the
black
tents
of
his
brothers
were
encased
in
a
fine
glaze
of
ice.

So
there
is
magic
beyond
the
Wall
after
all.
He
found
himself
thinking
of
his
sisters,
perhaps
because
he’d
dreamed
of
them
last
night.
Sansa
would
call
this
an
enchantment,
and
tears
would
fill
her
eyes
at
the
wonder
of
it,
but
Arya
would
run
out
laughing
and
shouting,
wanting
to
touch
it
all.

“Lord
Snow?”
he
heard.
Soft
and
meek.
He
turned.

Crouched
atop
the
rock
that
had
sheltered
him
during
the
night
was
the
rabbit
keeper,
wrapped
in
a
black
cloak
so
large
it
drowned
her.
Sam’s
cloak,
Jon
realized
at
once.
Why
is
she
wearing
Sam’s
cloak?
“The
fat
one
told
me
I’d
find
you
here,
m’lord,”
she
said.

“We
ate
the
rabbit,
if
that’s
what
you
came
for.”
The
admission
made
him
feel
absurdly
guilty.

“Old
Lord
Crow,
him
with
the
talking
bird,
he
gave
Craster
a
crossbow
worth
a
hundred
rabbits.”
Her
arms
closed
over
the
swell
of
her
belly.
“Is
it
true,
m’lord?
Are
you
brother
to
a
king?”

“A
half
brother,”
he
admitted.
“I’m
Ned
Stark’s
bastard.
My
brother
Robb
is
the
King
in
the
North.
Why
are
you
here?”

“The
fat
one,
that
Sam,
he
said
to
see
you.
He
give
me
his
cloak,
so
no
one
would
say
I
didn’t
belong.”

“Won’t
Craster
be
angry
with
you?”

“My
father
drank
overmuch
of
the
Lord
Crow’s
wine
last
night.
He’ll
sleep
most
of
the
day.”
Her
breath
frosted
the
air
in
small
nervous
puffs.
“They
say
the
king
gives
justice
and
protects
the
weak.”
She
started
to
climb
off
the
rock,
awkwardly,
but
the
ice
had
made
it
slippery
and
her
foot
went
out
from
under
her.
Jon
caught
her
before
she
could
fall,
and
helped
her
safely
down.
The
woman
knelt
on
the
icy
ground.
“M’lord,
I
beg
you—”

“Don’t
beg
me
anything.
Go
back
to
your
hall,
you
shouldn’t
be
here.
We
were
commanded
not
to
speak
to
Craster’s
women.”

“You
don’t
have
to
speak
with
me,
m’lord.
Just
take
me
with
you,
when
you
go,
that’s
all
I
ask.”

All
she
asks,
he
thought.
As
if
that
were
nothing.

“I’ll…
I’ll
be
your
wife,
if
you
like.
My
father,
he’s
got
nineteen
now,
one
less
won’t
hurt
him
none.”

“Black
brothers
are
sworn
never
to
take
wives,
don’t
you
know
that?
And
we’re
guests
in
your
father’s
hall
besides.”

“Not
you,”
she
said.
“I
watched.
You
never
ate
at
his
board,
nor
slept
by
his
fire.
He
never
gave
you
guest-right,
so
you’re
not
bound
to
him.
It’s
for
the
baby
I
have
to
go.”

“I
don’t
even
know
your
name.”

“Gilly,
he
called
me.
For
the
gillyflower.”

“That’s
pretty.”
He
remembered
Sansa
telling
him
once
that
he
should
say
that
whenever
a
lady
told
him
her
name.
He
could
not
help
the
girl,
but
perhaps
the
courtesy
would
please
her.
“Is
it
Craster
who
frightens
you,
Gilly?”

“For
the
baby,
not
for
me.
If
it’s
a
girl,
that’s
not
so
bad,
she’ll
grow
a
few
years
and
he’ll
marry
her.
But
Nella
says
it’s
to
be
a
boy,
and
she’s
had
six
and
knows
these
things.
He
gives
the
boys
to
the
gods.
Come
the
white
cold,
he
does,
and
of
late
it
comes
more
often.
That’s
why
he
started
giving
them
sheep,
even
though
he
has
a
taste
for
mutton.
Only
now
the
sheep’s
gone
too.
Next
it
will
be
dogs,
till…”
She
lowered
her
eyes
and
stroked
her
belly.

“What
gods?”
Jon
was
remembering
that
they’d
seen
no
boys
in
Craster’s
Keep,
nor
men
either,
save
Craster
himself.

“The
cold
gods,”
she
said.
“The
ones
in
the
night.
The
white
shadows.”

And
suddenly
Jon
was
back
in
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower
again.
A
severed
hand
was
climbing
his
calf
and
when
he
pried
it
off
with
the
point
of
his
longsword,
it
lay
writhing,
fingers
opening
and
closing.
The
dead
man
rose
to
his
feet,
blue
eyes
shining
in
that
gashed
and
swollen
face.
Ropes
of
torn
flesh
hung
from
the
great
wound
in
his
belly,
yet
there
was
no
blood.

“What
color
are
their
eyes?”
he
asked
her.

“Blue.
As
bright
as
blue
stars,
and
as
cold.”

She
has
seen
them,
he
thought.
Craster
lied.

“Will
you
take
me?
Just
so
far
as
the
Wall—”

“We
do
not
ride
for
the
Wall.
We
ride
north,
after
Mance
Rayder
and
these
Others,
these
white
shadows
and
their
wights.
We
seek
them,
Gilly.
Your
babe
would
not
be
safe
with
us.”

Her
fear
was
plain
on
her
face.
“You
will
come
back,
though.
When
your
warring’s
done,
you’ll
pass
this
way
again.”

“We
may.”
If
any
of
us
still
live.
“That’s
for
the
Old
Bear
to
say,
the
one
you
call
the
Lord
Crow.
I’m
only
his
squire.
I
do
not
choose
the
road
I
ride.”

“No.”
He
could
hear
the
defeat
in
her
voice.
“Sorry
to
be
of
trouble,
m’lord.
I
only…
they
said
the
king
keeps
people
safe,
and
I
thought…”
Despairing,
she
ran,
Sam’s
cloak
flapping
behind
her
like
great
black
wings.

Jon
watched
her
go,
his
joy
in
the
morning’s
brittle
beauty
gone.
Damn
her,
he
thought
resentfully,
and
damn
Sam
twice
for
sending
her
to
me.
What
did
he
think
I
could
do
for
her?
We’re
here
to
fight
wildlings,
not
save
them.

Other
men
were
crawling
from
their
shelters,
yawning
and
stretching.
The
magic
was
already
faded,
icy
brightness
turning
back
to
common
dew
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun.
Someone
had
gotten
a
fire
started;
he
could
smell
woodsmoke
drifting
through
the
trees,
and
the
smoky
scent
of
bacon.
Jon
took
down
his
cloak
and
snapped
it
against
the
rock,
shattering
the
thin
crust
of
ice
that
had
formed
in
the
night,
then
gathered
up
Longclaw
and
shrugged
an
arm
through
a
shoulder
strap.
A
few
yards
away
he
made
water
into
a
frozen
bush,
his
piss
steaming
in
the
cold
air
and
melting
the
ice
wherever
it
fell.
Afterward
he
laced
up
his
black
wool
breeches
and
followed
the
smells.

Grenn
and
Dywen
were
among
the
brothers
who
had
gathered
round
the
fire.
Hake
handed
Jon
a
hollow
heel
of
bread
filled
with
burnt
bacon
and
chunks
of
salt
fish
warmed
in
bacon
grease.
He
wolfed
it
down
while
listening
to
Dywen
boast
of
having
three
of
Craster’s
women
during
the
night.

“You
did
not,”
Grenn
said,
scowling.
“I
would
have
seen.”

Dywen
whapped
him
up
alongside
his
ear
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“You?
Seen?
You’re
blind
as
Maester
Aemon.
You
never
even
saw
that
bear.”

“What
bear?
Was
there
a
bear?”

“There’s
always
a
bear,”
declared
Dolorous
Edd
in
his
usual
tone
of
gloomy
resignation.
“One
killed
my
brother
when
I
was
young.
Afterward
it
wore
his
teeth
around
its
neck
on
a
leather
thong.
And
they
were
good
teeth
too,
better
than
mine.
I’ve
had
nothing
but
trouble
with
my
teeth.”

“Did
Sam
sleep
in
the
hall
last
night?”
Jon
asked
him.

“I’d
not
call
it
sleeping.
The
ground
was
hard,
the
rushes
ill-smelling,
and
my
brothers
snore
frightfully.
Speak
of
bears
if
you
will,
none
ever
growled
so
fierce
as
Brown
Bernarr.
I
was
warm,
though.
Some
dogs
crawled
atop
me
during
the
night.
My
cloak
was
almost
dry
when
one
of
them
pissed
in
it.
Or
perhaps
it
was
Brown
Bernarr.
Have
you
noticed
that
the
rain
stopped
the
instant
I
had
a
roof
above
me?
It
will
start
again
now
that
I’m
back
out.
Gods
and
dogs
alike
delight
to
piss
on
me.”

“I’d
best
go
see
to
Lord
Mormont,”
said
Jon.

The
rain
might
have
stopped,
but
the
compound
was
still
a
morass
of
shallow
lakes
and
slippery
mud.
Black
brothers
were
folding
their
tents,
feeding
their
horses,
and
chewing
on
strips
of
salt
beef.
Jarman
Buckwell’s
scouts
were
tightening
the
girths
on
their
saddles
before
setting
out.
“Jon,”
Buckwell
greeted
him
from
horseback.
“Keep
a
good
edge
on
that
bastard
sword
of
yours.
We’ll
be
needing
it
soon
enough.”

Craster’s
hall
was
dim
after
daylight.
Inside,
the
night’s
torches
had
burned
low,
and
it
was
hard
to
know
that
the
sun
had
risen.
Lord
Mormont’s
raven
was
the
first
to
spy
him
enter.
Three
lazy
flaps
of
its
great
black
wings,
and
it
perched
atop
Longclaw’s
hilt.
“Corn?”
It
nipped
at
a
strand
of
Jon’s
hair.

“Ignore
that
wretched
beggar
bird,
Jon,
it’s
just
had
half
my
bacon.”
The
Old
Bear
sat
at
Craster’s
board,
breaking
his
fast
with
the
other
officers
on
fried
bread,
bacon,
and
sheepgut
sausage.
Craster’s
new
axe
was
on
the
table,
its
gold
inlay
gleaming
faintly
in
the
torchlight.
Its
owner
was
sprawled
unconscious
in
the
sleeping
loft
above,
but
the
women
were
all
up,
moving
about
and
serving.
“What
sort
of
day
do
we
have?”

“Cold,
but
the
rain
has
stopped.”

“Very
good.
See
that
my
horse
is
saddled
and
ready.
I
mean
for
us
to
ride
within
the
hour.
Have
you
eaten?
Craster
serves
plain
fare,
but
filling.”

I
will
not
eat
Craster’s
food,
he
decided
suddenly.
“I
broke
my
fast
with
the
men,
my
lord.”
Jon
shooed
the
raven
off
Longclaw.
The
bird
hopped
back
to
Mormont’s
shoulder,
where
it
promptly
shat.
“You
might
have
done
that
on
Snow
instead
of
saving
it
for
me,”
the
Old
Bear
grumbled.
The
raven
quorked.

He
found
Sam
behind
the
hall,
standing
with
Gilly
at
the
broken
rabbit
hutch.
She
was
helping
him
back
into
his
cloak,
but
when
she
saw
Jon
she
stole
away.
Sam
gave
him
a
look
of
wounded
reproach.
“I
thought
you
would
help
her.”

“And
how
was
I
to
do
that?”
Jon
said
sharply.
“Take
her
with
us,
wrapped
up
in
your
cloak?
We
were
commanded
not
to—”

“I
know,”
said
Sam
guiltily,
“but
she
was
afraid.
I
know
what
it
is
to
be
afraid.
I
told
her…”
He
swallowed.

“What?
That
we’d
take
her
with
us?”

Sam’s
fat
face
blushed
a
deep
red.
“On
the
way
home.”
He
could
not
meet
Jon’s
eyes.
“She’s
going
to
have
a
baby.”

“Sam,
have
you
taken
leave
of
all
your
sense?
We
may
not
even
return
this
way.
And
if
we
do,
do
you
think
the
Old
Bear
is
going
to
let
you
pack
off
one
of
Craster’s
wives?”

“I
thought…
maybe
by
then
I
could
think
of
a
way…”

“I
have
no
time
for
this,
I
have
horses
to
groom
and
saddle.”
Jon
walked
away
as
confused
as
he
was
angry.
Sam’s
heart
was
a
big
as
the
rest
of
him,
but
for
all
his
reading
he
could
be
as
thick
as
Grenn
at
times.
It
was
impossible,
and
dishonorable
besides.
So
why
do
I
feel
so
ashamed?

Jon
took
his
accustomed
position
at
Mormont’s
side
as
the
Night’s
Watch
streamed
out
past
the
skulls
on
Craster’s
gate.
They
struck
off
north
and
west
along
a
crooked
game
trail.
Melting
ice
dripped
down
all
about
them,
a
slower
sort
of
rain
with
its
own
soft
music.
North
of
the
compound,
the
brook
was
in
full
spate,
choked
with
leaves
and
bits
of
wood,
but
the
scouts
had
found
where
the
ford
lay
and
the
column
was
able
to
splash
across.
The
water
ran
as
high
as
a
horse’s
belly.
Ghost
swam,
emerging
on
the
bank
with
his
white
fur
dripping
brown.
When
he
shook,
spraying
mud
and
water
in
all
directions,
Mormont
said
nothing,
but
on
his
shoulder
the
raven
screeched.

“My
lord,”
Jon
said
quietly
as
the
wood
closed
in
around
them
once
more.
“Craster
has
no
sheep.
Nor
any
sons.”

Mormont
made
no
answer.

“At
Winterfell
one
of
the
serving
women
told
us
stories,”
Jon
went
on.
“She
used
to
say
that
there
were
wildlings
who
would
lay
with
the
Others
to
birth
half-human
children.”

“Hearth
tales.
Does
Craster
seem
less
than
human
to
you?”

In
half
a
hundred
ways.
“He
gives
his
sons
to
the
wood.”

A
long
silence.
Then:
“Yes.”
And
“Yes,”
the
raven
muttered,
strutting.
“Yes,
yes,
yes.”

“You
knew?”

“Smallwood
told
me.
Long
ago.
All
the
rangers
know,
though
few
will
talk
of
it.”

“Did
my
uncle
know?”

“All
the
rangers,”
Mormont
repeated.
“You
think
I
ought
to
stop
him.
Kill
him
if
need
be.”
The
Old
Bear
sighed.
“Were
it
only
that
he
wished
to
rid
himself
of
some
mouths,
I’d
gladly
send
Yoren
or
Conwys
to
collect
the
boys.
We
could
raise
them
to
the
black
and
the
Watch
would
be
that
much
the
stronger.
But
the
wildlings
serve
crueler
gods
than
you
or
I.
These
boys
are
Craster’s
offerings.
His
prayers,
if
you
will.”

His
wives
must
offer
different
prayers,
Jon
thought.

“How
is
it
you
came
to
know
this?”
the
Old
Bear
asked
him.
“From
one
of
Craster’s
wives?”

“Yes,
my
lord,”
Jon
confessed.
“I
would
sooner
not
tell
you
which.
She
was
frightened
and
wanted
help.”

“The
wide
world
is
full
of
people
wanting
help,
Jon.
Would
that
some
could
find
the
courage
to
help
themselves.
Craster
sprawls
in
his
loft
even
now,
stinking
of
wine
and
lost
to
sense.
On
his
board
below
lies
a
sharp
new
axe.
Were
it
me,
I’d
name
it
‘Answered
Prayer’
and
make
an
end.”

Yes.
Jon
thought
of
Gilly.
She
and
her
sisters.
They
were
nineteen,
and
Craster
was
one,
but…

“Yet
it
would
be
an
ill
day
for
us
if
Craster
died.
Your
uncle
could
tell
you
of
the
times
Craster’s
Keep
made
the
difference
between
life
and
death
for
our
rangers.”

“My
father…”
He
hesitated.

“Go
on,
Jon.
Say
what
you
would
say.”

“My
father
once
told
me
that
some
men
are
not
worth
having,”
Jon
finished.
“A
bannerman
who
is
brutal
or
unjust
dishonors
his
liege
lord
as
well
as
himself.”

“Craster
is
his
own
man.
He
has
sworn
us
no
vows.
Nor
is
he
subject
to
our
laws.
Your
heart
is
noble,
Jon,
but
learn
a
lesson
here.
We
cannot
set
the
world
to
rights.
That
is
not
our
purpose.
The
Night’s
Watch
has
other
wars
to
fight.”

Other
wars.
Yes.
I
must
remember.
“Jarman
Buckwell
said
I
might
have
need
of
my
sword
soon.”

“Did
he?”
Mormont
did
not
seem
pleased.
“Craster
said
much
and
more
last
night,
and
confirmed
enough
of
my
fears
to
condemn
me
to
a
sleepless
night
on
his
floor.
Mance
Rayder
is
gathering
his
people
together
in
the
Frostfangs.
That’s
why
the
villages
are
empty.
It
is
the
same
tale
that
Ser
Denys
Mallister
had
from
the
wildling
his
men
captured
in
the
Gorge,
but
Craster
has
added
the
where,
and
that
makes
all
the
difference.”

“Is
he
making
a
city,
or
an
army?”

“Now,
that
is
the
question.
How
many
wildlings
are
there?
How
many
men
of
fighting
age?
No
one
knows
with
certainty.
The
Frostfangs
are
cruel,
inhospitable,
a
wilderness
of
stone
and
ice.
They
will
not
long
sustain
any
great
number
of
people.
I
can
see
only
one
purpose
in
this
gathering.
Mance
Rayder
means
to
strike
south,
into
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”

“Wildlings
have
invaded
the
realm
before.”
Jon
had
heard
the
tales
from
Old
Nan
and
Maester
Luwin
both,
back
at
Winterfell.
“Raymun
Redbeard
led
them
south
in
the
time
of
my
grandfather’s
grandfather,
and
before
him
there
was
a
king
named
Bael
the
Bard.”

“Aye,
and
long
before
them
came
the
Horned
Lord
and
the
brother
kings
Gendel
and
Gorne,
and
in
ancient
days
Joramun,
who
blew
the
Horn
of
Winter
and
woke
giants
from
the
earth.
Each
man
of
them
broke
his
strength
on
the
Wall,
or
was
broken
by
the
power
of
Winterfell
on
the
far
side…
but
the
Night’s
Watch
is
only
a
shadow
of
what
we
were,
and
who
remains
to
oppose
the
wildlings
besides
us?
The
Lord
of
Winterfell
is
dead,
and
his
heir
has
marched
his
strength
south
to
fight
the
Lannisters.
The
wildlings
may
never
again
have
such
a
chance
as
this.
I
knew
Mance
Rayder,
Jon.
He
is
an
oathbreaker,
yes…
but
he
has
eyes
to
see,
and
no
man
has
ever
dared
to
name
him
faintheart.”

“What
will
we
do?”
asked
Jon.

“Find
him,”
said
Mormont.
“Fight
him.
Stop
him.”

Three
hundred,
thought
Jon,
against
the
fury
of
the
wild.
His
fingers
opened
and
closed.





THEON

She
was
undeniably
a
beauty.
But
your
first
is
always
beautiful,
Theon
Greyjoy
thought.

“Now
there’s
a
pretty
grin,”
a
woman’s
voice
said
behind
him.
“The
lordling
likes
the
look
of
her,
does
he?”

Theon
turned
to
give
her
an
appraising
glance.
He
liked
what
he
saw.
Ironborn,
he
knew
at
a
glance;
lean
and
longlegged,
with
black
hair
cut
short,
wind-chafed
skin,
strong
sure
hands,
a
dirk
at
her
belt.
Her
nose
was
too
big
and
too
sharp
for
her
thin
face,
but
her
smile
made
up
for
it.
He
judged
her
a
few
years
older
than
he
was,
but
no
more
than
five-and-twenty.
She
moved
as
if
she
were
used
to
a
deck
beneath
her
feet.

“Yes,
she’s
a
sweet
sight,”
he
told
her,
“though
not
half
so
sweet
as
you.”

“Oho.”
She
grinned.
“I’d
best
be
careful.
This
lordling
has
a
honeyed
tongue.”

“Taste
it
and
see.”

“Is
it
that
way,
then?”
she
said,
eyeing
him
boldly.
There
were
women
on
the
Iron
Islands—not
many,
but
a
few—who
crewed
the
longships
along
with
their
men,
and
it
was
said
that
salt
and
sea
changed
them,
gave
them
a
man’s
appetites.
“Have
you
been
that
long
at
sea,
lordling?
Or
were
there
no
women
where
you
came
from?”

“Women
enough,
but
none
like
you.”

“And
how
would
you
know
what
I’m
like?”

“My
eyes
can
see
your
face.
My
ears
can
hear
your
laughter.
And
my
cock’s
gone
hard
as
a
mast
for
you.”

The
woman
stepped
close
and
pressed
a
hand
to
the
front
of
his
breeches.
“Well,
you’re
no
liar,”
she
said,
giving
him
a
squeeze
through
the
cloth.
“How
bad
does
it
hurt?”

“Fiercely.”

“Poor
lordling.”
She
released
him
and
stepped
back.
“As
it
happens,
I’m
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
child.”

“The
gods
are
good,”
Theon
said.
“No
chance
I’d
give
you
a
bastard
that
way.”

“Even
so,
my
man
wouldn’t
thank
you.”

“No,
but
you
might.”

“And
why
would
that
be?
I’ve
had
lords
before.
They’re
made
the
same
as
other
men.”

“Have
you
ever
had
a
prince?”
he
asked
her.
“When
you’re
wrinkled
and
grey
and
your
teats
hang
past
your
belly,
you
can
tell
your
children’s
children
that
once
you
loved
a
king.”

“Oh,
is
it
love
we’re
talking
now?
And
here
I
thought
it
was
just
cocks
and
cunts.”

“Is
it
love
you
fancy?”
He’d
decided
that
he
liked
this
wench,
whoever
she
was;
her
sharp
wit
was
a
welcome
respite
from
the
damp
gloom
of
Pyke.
“Shall
I
name
my
longship
after
you,
and
play
you
the
high
harp,
and
keep
you
in
a
tower
room
in
my
castle
with
only
jewels
to
wear,
like
a
princess
in
a
song?”

“You
ought
to
name
your
ship
after
me,”
she
said,
ignoring
all
the
rest.
“It
was
me
who
built
her.”

“Sigrin
built
her.
My
lord
father’s
shipwright.”

“I’m
Esgred.
Ambrode’s
daughter,
and
wife
to
Sigrin.”

He
had
not
known
that
Ambrode
had
a
daughter,
or
Sigrin
a
wife…
but
he’d
met
the
younger
shipwright
only
once,
and
the
older
one
he
scarce
remembered.
“You’re
wasted
on
Sigrin.”

“Oho.
Sigrin
told
me
this
sweet
ship
is
wasted
on
you.”

Theon
bristled.
“Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“Prince
Theon
of
House
Greyjoy.
Who
else?
Tell
me
true,
my
lord,
how
well
do
you
love
her,
this
new
maid
of
yours?
Sigrin
will
want
to
know.”

The
longship
was
so
new
that
she
still
smelled
of
pitch
and
resin.
His
uncle
Aeron
would
bless
her
on
the
morrow,
but
Theon
had
ridden
over
from
Pyke
to
get
a
look
at
her
before
she
was
launched.
She
was
not
so
large
as
Lord
Balon’s
own
Great
Kraken
or
his
uncle
Victarion’s
Iron
Victory,
but
she
looked
swift
and
sweet,
even
sitting
in
her
wooden
cradle
on
the
strand;
lean
black
hull
a
hundred
feet
long,
a
single
tall
mast,
fifty
long
oars,
deck
enough
for
a
hundred
men…
and
at
the
prow,
the
great
iron
ram
in
the
shape
of
an
arrowhead.
“Sigrin
did
me
good
service,”
he
admitted.
“Is
she
as
fast
as
she
looks?”

“Faster—for
a
master
that
knows
how
to
handle
her.”

“It
has
been
a
few
years
since
I
sailed
a
ship.”
And
I’ve
never
captained
one,
if
truth
be
told.
“Still,
I’m
a
Greyjoy,
and
an
ironman.
The
sea
is
in
my
blood.”

“And
your
blood
will
be
in
the
sea,
if
you
sail
the
way
you
talk,”
she
told
him.

“I
would
never
mistreat
such
a
fair
maiden.”

“Fair
maiden?”
She
laughed.
“She’s
a
sea
bitch,
this
one.”

“There,
and
now
you’ve
named
her.
Sea
Bitch.”

That
amused
her;
he
could
see
the
sparkle
in
her
dark
eyes.
“And
you
said
you’d
name
her
after
me,”
she
said
in
a
voice
of
wounded
reproach.

“I
did.”
He
caught
her
hand.
“Help
me,
my
lady.
In
the
green
lands,
they
believe
a
woman
with
child
means
good
fortune
for
any
man
who
beds
her.”

“And
what
would
they
know
about
ships
in
the
green
lands?
Or
women,
for
that
matter?
Besides,
I
think
you
made
that
up.”

“If
I
confess,
will
you
still
love
me?”

“Still?
When
have
I
ever
loved
you?”

“Never,”
he
admitted,
“but
I
am
trying
to
repair
that
lack,
my
sweet
Esgred.
The
wind
is
cold.
Come
aboard
my
ship
and
let
me
warm
you.
On
the
morrow
my
uncle
Aeron
will
pour
seawater
over
her
prow
and
mumble
a
prayer
to
the
Drowned
God,
but
I’d
sooner
bless
her
with
the
milk
of
my
loins,
and
yours.”

“The
Drowned
God
might
not
take
that
kindly.”

“Bugger
the
Drowned
God.
If
he
troubles
us,
I’ll
drown
him
again.
We’re
off
to
war
within
a
fortnight.
Would
you
send
me
into
battle
all
sleepless
with
longing?”

“Gladly.”

“A
cruel
maid.
My
ship
is
well
named.
If
I
steer
her
onto
the
rocks
in
my
distraction,
you’ll
have
yourself
to
blame.”

“Do
you
plan
to
steer
with
this?”
Esgred
brushed
the
front
of
his
breeches
once
more,
and
smiled
as
a
finger
traced
the
iron
outline
of
his
manhood.

“Come
back
to
Pyke
with
me,”
he
said
suddenly,
thinking,
What
will
Lord
Balon
say?
And
why
should
I
care?
I
am
a
man
grown,
if
I
want
to
bring
a
wench
to
bed
it
is
no
one’s
business
but
my
own.

“And
what
would
I
do
in
Pyke?”
Her
hand
stayed
where
it
was.

“My
father
will
feast
his
captains
tonight.”
He
had
them
to
feast
every
night,
while
he
waited
for
the
last
stragglers
to
arrive,
but
Theon
saw
no
need
to
tell
all
that.

“Would
you
make
me
your
captain
for
the
night,
my
lord
prince?”
She
had
the
wickedest
smile
he’d
ever
seen
on
a
woman.

“I
might.
If
I
knew
you’d
steer
me
safe
into
port.”

“Well,
I
know
which
end
of
the
oar
goes
in
the
sea,
and
there’s
no
one
better
with
ropes
and
knots.”
One-handed,
she
undid
the
lacing
of
his
breeches,
then
grinned
and
stepped
lightly
away
from
him.
“A
pity
I’m
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
child.”

Flustered,
Theon
laced
himself
back
up.
“I
need
to
start
back
to
the
castle.
if
you
do
not
come
with
me,
I
may
lose
my
way
for
grief,
and
all
the
islands
would
be
poorer.”

“We
couldn’t
have
that…
but
I
have
no
horse,
my
lord.”

“You
could
take
my
squire’s
mount.”

“And
leave
your
poor
squire
to
walk
all
the
way
to
Pyke?”

“Share
mine,
then.”

“You’d
like
that
well
enough.”
The
smile
again.
“Now,
would
I
be
behind
you,
or
in
front?”

“You
would
be
wherever
you
liked.”

“I
like
to
be
on
top.”

Where
has
this
wench
been
all
my
life?
“My
father’s
hall
is
dim
and
dank.
It
needs
Esgred
to
make
the
fires
blaze.”

“The
lordling
has
a
honeyed
tongue.”

“Isn’t
that
where
we
began?”

She
threw
up
her
hands.
“And
where
we
end.
Esgred
is
yours,
sweet
prince.
Take
me
to
your
castle.
Let
me
see
your
proud
towers
rising
from
the
sea.”

“I
left
my
horse
at
the
inn.
Come.”
They
walked
down
the
strand
together,
and
when
Theon
took
her
arm,
she
did
not
pull
away.
He
liked
the
way
she
walked;
there
was
a
boldness
to
it,
part
saunter
and
part
sway,
that
suggested
she
would
be
just
as
bold
beneath
the
blankets.

Lordsport
was
as
crowded
as
he’d
ever
seen
it,
swarming
with
the
crews
of
the
longships
that
lined
the
pebbled
shore
and
rode
at
anchor
well
out
past
the
breakwater.
Ironmen
did
not
bend
their
knees
often
nor
easily,
but
Theon
noted
that
oarsmen
and
townfolk
alike
grew
quiet
as
they
passed,
and
acknowledged
him
with
respectful
bows
of
the
head.
They
have
finally
learned
who
I
am,
he
thought.
And
past
time
too.

Lord
Goodbrother
of
Great
Wyk
had
come
in
the
night
before
with
his
main
strength,
near
forty
longships.
His
men
were
everywhere,
conspicuous
in
their
striped
goat’s
hair
sashes.
It
was
said
about
the
inn
that
Otter
Gimpknee’s
whores
were
being
fucked
bowlegged
by
beardless
boys
in
sashes.
The
boys
were
welcome
to
them
so
far
as
Theon
was
concerned.
A
poxier
den
of
slatterns
he
hoped
he’d
never
see.
His
present
companion
was
more
to
his
taste.
That
she
was
wed
to
his
father’s
shipwright
and
pregnant
to
boot
only
made
her
more
intriguing.

“Has
my
lord
prince
begun
choosing
his
crew?”
Esgred
asked
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
stable.
“Ho,
Bluetooth,”
she
shouted
to
a
passing
seafarer,
a
tall
man
in
bearskin
vest
and
raven-winged
helm.
“How
fares
your
bride?”

“Fat
with
child,
and
talking
of
twins.”

“So
soon?”
Esgred
smiled
that
wicked
smile.
“You
got
your
oar
in
the
water
quickly.”

“Aye,
and
stroked
and
stroked
and
stroked,”
roared
the
man.

“A
big
man,”
Theon
observed.
“Bluetooth,
was
it?
Should
I
choose
him
for
my
Sea
Bitch?”

“Only
if
you
mean
to
insult
him.
Bluetooth
has
a
sweet
ship
of
his
own.”

“I
have
been
too
long
away
to
know
one
man
from
another,”
Theon
admitted.
He’d
looked
for
a
few
of
the
friends
he’d
played
with
as
a
boy,
but
they
were
gone,
dead,
or
grown
into
strangers.
“My
uncle
Victarion
has
loaned
me
his
own
steersman.”

“Rymolf
Stormdrunk?
A
good
man,
so
long
as
he’s
sober.”
She
saw
more
faces
she
knew,
and
called
out
to
a
passing
trio,
“Uller,
Qarl.
Where’s
your
brother,
Skyte?”

“The
Drowned
God
needed
a
strong
oarsman,
I
fear,”
replied
the
stocky
man
with
the
white
streak
in
his
beard.

“What
he
means
is,
Eldiss
drank
too
much
wine
and
his
fat
belly
burst,”
said
the
pink-cheeked
youth
beside
him.

“What’s
dead
may
never
die,”
Esgred
said.

“What’s
dead
may
never
die.”

Theon
muttered
the
words
with
them.
“You
seem
well
known,”
he
said
to
the
woman
when
the
men
had
passed
on.

“Every
man
loves
the
shipwright’s
wife.
He
had
better,
lest
he
wants
his
ship
to
sink.
If
you
need
men
to
pull
your
oars,
you
could
do
worse
than
those
three.”

“Lordsport
has
no
lack
of
strong
arms.”
Theon
had
given
the
matter
no
little
thought.
It
was
fighters
he
wanted,
and
men
who
would
be
loyal
to
him,
not
to
his
lord
father
or
his
uncles.
He
was
playing
the
part
of
a
dutiful
young
prince
for
the
moment,
while
he
waited
for
Lord
Balon
to
reveal
the
fullness
of
his
plans.
If
it
turned
out
that
he
did
not
like
those
plans
or
his
part
in
them,
however,
well…

“Strength
is
not
enough.
A
longship’s
oars
must
move
as
one
if
you
would
have
her
best
speed.
Choose
men
who
have
rowed
together
before,
if
you’re
wise.”

“Sage
counsel.
Perhaps
you’d
help
me
choose
them.”
Let
her
believe
I
want
her
wisdom,
women
fancy
that.

“I
may.
If
you
treat
me
kindly.”

“How
else?”

Theon
quickened
his
stride
as
they
neared
the
Myraham,
rocking
high
and
empty
by
the
quay.
Her
captain
had
tried
to
sail
a
fortnight
past,
but
Lord
Balon
would
not
permit
it.
None
of
the
merchantmen
that
called
at
Lordsport
had
been
allowed
to
depart
again;
his
father
wanted
no
word
of
the
hosting
to
reach
the
mainland
before
he
was
ready
to
strike.

“Milord,”
a
plaintive
voice
called
down
from
the
forecastle
of
the
merchanter.
The
captain’s
daughter
leaned
over
the
rail,
gazing
after
him.
Her
father
had
forbidden
her
to
come
ashore,
but
whenever
Theon
came
to
Lordsport
he
spied
her
wandering
forlornly
about
the
deck.
“Milord,
a
moment,”
she
called
after
him.
“As
it
please
milord…”

“Did
she?”
Esgred
asked
as
Theon
hurried
her
past
the
cog.
“Please
milord?”

He
saw
no
sense
in
being
coy
with
this
one.
“For
a
time.
Now
she
wants
to
be
my
salt
wife.”

“Oho.
Well,
she’d
profit
from
some
salting,
no
doubt.
Too
soft
and
bland,
that
one.
Or
am
I
wrong?”

“You’re
not
wrong.”
Soft
and
bland.
Precisely.
How
had
she
known?

He
had
told
Wex
to
wait
at
the
inn.
The
common
room
was
so
crowded
that
Theon
had
to
push
his
way
through
the
door.
Not
a
seat
was
to
be
had
at
bench
nor
table.
Nor
did
he
see
his
squire.
“Wex”,
he
shouted
over
the
din
and
clatter.
If
he’s
up
with
one
of
those
poxy
whores,
I’ll
strip
the
hide
off
him,
he
was
thinking
when
he
finally
spied
the
boy,
dicing
near
the
hearth…
and
winning
too,
by
the
look
of
the
pile
of
coins
before
him.

“Time
to
go,”
Theon
announced.
When
the
boy
paid
him
no
mind,
he
seized
him
by
the
ear
and
pulled
him
from
the
game.
Wex
grabbed
up
a
fistful
of
coppers
and
came
along
without
a
word.
That
was
one
of
the
things
Theon
liked
best
about
him.
Most
squires
have
loose
tongues,
but
Wex
had
been
born
dumb…
which
didn’t
seem
to
keep
him
from
being
clever
as
any
twelve-year-old
had
a
right
to
be.
He
was
a
baseborn
son
of
one
of
Lord
Botley’s
half
brothers.
Taking
him
as
squire
had
been
part
of
the
price
Theon
had
paid
for
his
horse.

When
Wex
saw
Esgred,
his
eyes
went
round.
You’d
think
he’d
never
seen
a
woman
before,
Theon
thought.
“Esgred
will
be
riding
with
me
back
to
Pyke.
Saddle
the
horses,
and
be
quick
about
it.”

The
boy
had
ridden
in
on
a
scrawny
little
garron
from
Lord
Balon’s
stable,
but
Theon’s
mount
was
quite
another
sort
of
beast.
“Where
did
you
find
that
hellhorse?”
Esgred
asked
when
she
saw
him,
but
from
the
way
she
laughed
he
knew
she
was
impressed.

“Lord
Botley
bought
him
in
Lannisport
a
year
past,
but
he
proved
to
be
too
much
horse
for
him,
so
Botley
was
pleased
to
sell.”
The
Iron
Islands
were
too
sparse
and
rocky
for
breeding
good
horses.
Most
of
the
islanders
were
indifferent
riders
at
best,
more
comfortable
on
the
deck
of
a
longship
than
in
the
saddle.
Even
the
lords
rode
garrons
or
shaggy
Harlaw
ponies,
and
ox
carts
were
more
common
than
drays.
The
smallfolk
too
poor
to
own
either
one
pulled
their
own
plows
through
the
thin,
stony
soil.

But
Theon
had
spent
ten
years
in
Winterfell,
and
did
not
intend
to
go
to
war
without
a
good
mount
beneath
him.
Lord
Botley’s
misjudgment
was
his
good
fortune:
a
stallion
with
a
temper
as
black
as
his
hide,
larger
than
a
courser
if
not
quite
so
big
as
most
destriers.
As
Theon
was
not
quite
so
big
as
most
knights,
that
suited
him
admirably.
The
animal
had
fire
in
his
eyes.
When
he’d
met
his
new
owner,
he’d
pulled
back
his
lips
and
tried
to
bite
off
his
face.

“Does
he
have
a
name?”
Esgred
asked
Theon
as
he
mounted.

“Smiler.”
He
gave
her
a
hand,
and
pulled
her
up
in
front
of
him,
where
he
could
put
his
arms
around
her
as
they
rode.
“I
knew
a
man
once
who
told
me
that
I
smiled
at
the
wrong
things.”

“Do
you?”

“Only
by
the
lights
of
those
who
smile
at
nothing.”
He
thought
of
his
father
and
his
uncle
Aeron.

“Are
you
smiling
now,
my
lord
prince?”

“Oh,
yes.”
Theon
reached
around
her
to
take
the
reins.
She
was
almost
of
a
height
with
him.
Her
hair
could
have
used
a
wash
and
she
had
a
faded
pink
scar
on
her
pretty
neck,
but
he
liked
the
smell
of
her,
salt
and
sweat
and
woman.

The
ride
back
to
Pyke
promised
to
be
a
good
deal
more
interesting
than
the
ride
down
had
been.

When
they
were
well
beyond
Lordsport,
Theon
put
a
hand
on
her
breast.
Esgred
reached
up
and
plucked
it
away.
“I’d
keep
both
hands
on
the
reins,
or
this
black
beast
of
yours
is
like
to
fling
us
both
off
and
kick
us
to
death.”

“I
broke
him
of
that.”
Amused,
Theon
behaved
himself
for
a
while,
chatting
amiably
of
the
weather
(grey
and
overcast,
as
it
had
been
since
he
arrived,
with
frequent
rains)
and
telling
her
of
the
men
he’d
killed
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
When
he
reached
the
part
about
coming
that
close
to
the
Kingslayer
himself,
he
slid
his
hand
back
up
to
where
it
had
been.
Her
breasts
were
small,
but
he
liked
the
firmness
of
them.

“You
don’t
want
to
do
that,
my
lord
prince.”

“Oh,
but
I
do.”
Theon
gave
her
a
squeeze.

“Your
squire
is
watching
you.”

“Let
him.
He’ll
never
speak
of
it,
I
swear.”

Esgred
pried
his
fingers
off
her
breast.
This
time
she
kept
him
firmly
prisoned.
She
had
strong
hands.

“I
like
a
woman
with
a
good
tight
grip.”

She
snorted.
“I’d
not
have
thought
it,
by
that
wench
on
the
waterfront.”

“You
must
not
judge
me
by
her.
She
was
the
only
woman
on
the
ship.”

“Tell
me
of
your
father.
Will
he
welcome
me
kindly
to
his
castle?”

“Why
should
he?
He
scarcely
welcomed
me,
his
own
blood,
the
heir
to
Pyke
and
the
Iron
Islands.”

“Are
you?”
she
asked
mildly.
“It’s
said
that
you
have
uncles,
brothers,
a
sister.”

“My
brothers
are
long
dead,
and
my
sister…
well,
they
say
Asha’s
favorite
gown
is
a
chainmail
hauberk
that
hangs
down
past
her
knees,
with
boiled
leather
smallclothes
beneath.
Men’s
garb
won’t
make
her
a
man,
though.
I’ll
make
a
good
marriage
alliance
with
her
once
we’ve
won
the
war,
if
I
can
find
a
man
to
take
her.
As
I
recall,
she
had
a
nose
like
a
vulture’s
beak,
a
ripe
crop
of
pimples,
and
no
more
chest
than
a
boy.”

“You
can
marry
off
your
sister,”
Esgred
observed,
“but
not
your
uncles.”

“My
uncles…”
Theon’s
claim
took
precedence
over
those
of
his
father’s
three
brothers,
but
the
woman
had
touched
on
a
sore
point
nonetheless.
in
the
islands
it
was
scarce
unheard
of
for
a
strong,
ambitious
uncle
to
dispossess
a
weak
nephew
of
his
rights,
and
usually
murder
him
in
the
bargain.
But
I
am
not
weak,
Theon
told
himself,
and
I
mean
to
be
stronger
yet
by
the
time
my
father
dies.
“My
uncles
pose
no
threat
to
me,”
he
declared.
“Aeron
is
drunk
on
seawater
and
sanctity.
He
lives
only
for
his
god—”

“His
god?
Not
yours?”

“Mine
as
well.
What
is
dead
can
never
die.”
He
smiled
thinly.
“If
I
make
pious
noises
as
required,
Damphair
will
give
me
no
trouble.
And
my
uncle
Victarion—”

“Lord
Captain
of
the
Iron
Fleet,
and
a
fearsome
warrior.
I
have
heard
them
sing
of
him
in
the
alehouses.”

“During
my
lord
father’s
rebellion,
he
sailed
into
Lannisport
with
my
uncle
Euron
and
burned
the
Lannister
fleet
where
it
lay
at
anchor,”
Theon
recalled.
“The
plan
was
Euron’s,
though.
Victarion
is
like
some
great
grey
bullock,
strong
and
tireless
and
dutiful,
but
not
like
to
win
any
races.
No
doubt,
he’ll
serve
me
as
loyally
as
he
has
served
my
lord
father.
He
has
neither
the
wits
nor
the
ambition
to
plot
betrayal.”

“Euron
Croweye
has
no
lack
of
cunning,
though.
I’ve
heard
men
say
terrible
things
of
that
one.”

Theon
shifted
his
seat.
“My
uncle
Euron
has
not
been
seen
in
the
islands
for
close
on
two
years.
He
may
be
dead.”
If
so,
it
might
be
for
the
best.
Lord
Balon’s
eldest
brother
had
never
given
up
the
Old
Way,
even
for
a
day.
His
Silence,
with
its
black
sails
and
dark
red
hull,
was
infamous
in
every
port
from
Ibben
to
Asshai,
it
was
said.

“He
may
be
dead,”
Esgred
agreed,
“and
if
he
lives,
why,
he
has
spent
so
long
at
sea,
he’d
be
half
a
stranger
here.
The
ironborn
would
never
seat
a
stranger
in
the
Seastone
Chair.”

“I
suppose
not,”
Theon
replied,
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
would
call
him
a
stranger
as
well.
The
thought
made
him
frown.
Ten
years
is
a
long
while,
but
I
am
back
now,
and
my
father
is
far
from
dead.
I
have
time
to
prove
myself.

He
considered
fondling
Esgred’s
breast
again,
but
she
would
probably
only
take
his
hand
away,
and
all
this
talk
of
his
uncles
had
dampened
his
ardor
somewhat.
Time
enough
for
such
play
at
the
castle,
in
the
privacy
of
his
chambers.
“I
will
speak
to
Helya
when
we
reach
Pyke,
and
see
that
you
have
an
honored
place
at
the
feast,”
he
said.
“I
must
sit
on
the
dais,
at
my
father’s
right
hand,
but
I
will
come
down
and
join
you
when
he
leaves
the
hall.
He
seldom
lingers
long.
He
has
no
belly
for
drink
these
days.”

“A
grievous
thing
when
a
great
man
grows
old.”

“Lord
Balon
is
but
the
father
of
a
great
man.”

“A
modest
lordling.”

“Only
a
fool
humbles
himself
when
the
world
is
so
full
of
men
eager
to
do
that
job
for
him.”
He
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
nape
of
her
neck.

“What
shall
I
wear
to
this
great
feast?”
She
reached
back
and
pushed
his
face
away.

“I’ll
ask
Helya
to
garb
you.
One
of
my
lady
mother’s
gowns
might
do.
She
is
off
on
Harlaw,
and
not
expected
to
return.”

“The
cold
winds
have
worn
her
away,
I
hear.
Will
you
not
go
see
her?
Harlaw
is
only
a
day’s
sail,
and
surely
Lady
Greyjoy
yearns
for
a
last
sight
of
her
son.”

“Would
that
I
could.
I
am
kept
too
busy
here.
My
father
relies
on
me,
now
that
I
am
returned.
Come
peace,
perhaps…”

“Your
coming
might
bring
her
peace.”

“Now
you
sound
a
woman,”
Theon
complained.

“I
confess,
I
am…
and
new
with
child.”

Somehow
that
thought
excited
him.
“So
you
say,
but
your
body
shows
no
signs
of
it.
How
shall
it
be
proven?
Before
I
believe
you,
I
shall
need
to
see
your
breasts
grow
ripe,
and
taste
your
mother’s
milk.”

“And
what
will
my
husband
say
to
this?
Your
father’s
own
sworn
man
and
servant?”

“We’ll
give
him
so
many
ships
to
build,
he’ll
never
know
you’ve
left
him.”

She
laughed.
“It’s
a
cruel
lordling
who’s
seized
me.
If
I
promise
you
that
one
day
you
may
watch
my
babe
get
suck,
will
you
tell
me
more
of
your
war,
Theon
of
House
Greyjoy?
There
are
miles
and
mountains
still
ahead
of
us,
and
I
would
hear
of
this
wolf
king
you
served,
and
the
golden
lions
he
fights.”

Ever
anxious
to
please
her,
Theon
obliged.
The
rest
of
the
long
ride
passed
swiftly
as
he
filled
her
pretty
head
with
tales
of
Winterfell
and
war.
Some
of
the
things
he
said
astonished
him.
She
is
easy
to
talk
to,
gods
praise
her,
he
reflected.
I
feel
as
though
I’ve
known
her
for
years.
If
the
wench’s
pillow
play
is
half
the
equal
of
her
wit,
I’ll
need
to
keep
her…
He
thought
of
Sigrin
the
Shipwright,
a
thick-bodied,
thick-witted
man,
flaxen
hair
already
receding
from
a
pimpled
brow,
and
shook
his
head.
A
waste.
A
most
tragic
waste.

It
seemed
scarcely
any
time
at
all
before
the
great
curtain
wall
of
Pyke
loomed
up
before
them.

The
gates
were
open.
Theon
put
his
heels
into
Smiler
and
rode
through
at
a
brisk
trot.
The
hounds
were
barking
wildly
as
he
helped
Esgred
dismount.
Several
came
bounding
up,
tails
wagging.
They
shot
straight
past
him
and
almost
bowled
the
woman
over,
leaping
all
around
her,
yapping
and
licking.
“Off,”
Theon
shouted,
aiming
an
ineffectual
kick
at
one
big
brown
bitch,
but
Esgred
was
laughing
and
wrestling
with
them.

A
stableman
came
pounding
up
after
the
dogs.
“Take
the
horse,”
Theon
commanded
him,
“and
get
these
damn
dogs
away—”

The
lout
paid
him
no
mind.
His
face
broke
into
a
huge
gap-toothed
smile
and
he
said,
“Lady
Asha.
You’re
back.”

“Last
night,”
she
said.
“I
sailed
from
Great
Wyk
with
Lord
Goodbrother,
and
spent
the
night
at
the
inn.
My
little
brother
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
ride
with
him
from
Lordsport.”
She
kissed
one
of
the
dogs
on
the
nose
and
grinned
at
Theon.

All
he
could
do
was
stand
and
gape
at
her.
Asha.
No.
She
cannot
be
Asha.
He
realized
suddenly
that
there
were
two
Ashas
in
his
head.
One
was
the
little
girl
he
had
known.
The
other,
more
vaguely
imagined,
looked
something
like
her
mother.
Neither
looked
a
bit
like
this…
this…
this…

“The
pimples
went
when
the
breasts
came,”
she
explained
while
she
tussled
with
a
dog,
“but
I
kept
the
vulture’s
beak.”

Theon
found
his
voice.
“Why
didn’t
you
tell
me?”

Asha
let
go
of
the
hound
and
straightened.
“I
wanted
to
see
who
you
were
first.
And
I
did.”
She
gave
him
a
mocking
half
bow.
“And
now,
little
brother,
pray
excuse
me.
I
need
to
bathe
and
dress
for
the
feast.
I
wonder
if
I
still
have
that
chainmail
gown
I
like
to
wear
over
my
boiled
leather
smallclothes?”
She
gave
him
that
evil
grin,
and
crossed
the
bridge
with
that
walk
he’d
liked
so
well,
half
saunter
and
half
sway.

When
Theon
turned
away,
Wex
was
smirking
at
him.
He
gave
the
boy
a
clout
on
the
ear.
“That’s
for
enjoying
this
so
much.”
And
another,
harder.
“And
that’s
for
not
warning
me.
Next
time,
grow
a
tongue.”

His
own
chambers
in
the
Guest
Keep
had
never
seemed
so
chilly,
though
the
thralls
had
left
a
brazier
burning.
Theon
kicked
his
boots
off,
let
his
cloak
fall
to
the
floor,
and
poured
himself
a
cup
of
wine,
remembering
a
gawky
girl
with
knob
knees
and
pimples.
She
unlaced
my
breeches,
he
thought,
outraged,
and
she
said…
oh,
gods,
and
I
said…
He
groaned.
He
could
not
possibly
have
made
a
more
appalling
fool
of
himself.

No,
he
thought
then.
She
was
the
one
who
made
me
a
fool.
The
evil
bitch
must
have
enjoyed
every
moment
of
it.
And
the
way
she
kept
reaching
for
my
cock…

He
took
his
cup
and
went
to
the
window
seat,
where
he
sat
drinking
and
watching
the
sea
while
the
sun
darkened
over
Pyke.
I
have
no
place
here,
he
thought,
and
Asha
is
the
reason,
may
the
Others
take
her!
The
water
below
turned
from
green
to
grey
to
black.
By
then
he
could
hear
distant
music,
and
he
knew
it
was
time
to
change
for
the
feast.

Theon
chose
plain
boots
and
plainer
clothes,
somber
shades
of
black
and
grey
to
fit
his
mood.
No
ornament;
he
had
nothing
bought
with
iron.
I
might
have
taken
something
off
that
wildling
I
killed
to
save
Bran
Stark,
but
he
had
nothing
worth
the
taking.
That’s
my
cursed
luck,
I
kill
the
poor.

The
long
smoky
hall
was
crowded
with
his
father’s
lords
and
captains
when
Theon
entered,
near
four
hundred
of
them.
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
had
not
yet
returned
from
Old
Wyk
with
the
Stonehouses
and
Drumms,
but
all
the
rest
were
there—Harlaws
from
Harlaw,
Blacktydes
from
Blacktyde,
Sparrs,
Merlyns,
and
Goodbrothers
from
Great
Wyk,
Saltcliffes
and
Sunderlies
from
Saltcliffe,
and
Botleys
and
Wynches
from
the
other
side
of
Pyke.
The
thralls
were
pouring
ale,
and
there
was
music,
fiddles
and
skins
and
drums.
Three
burly
men
were
doing
the
finger
dance,
spinning
short-hafted
axes
at
each
other.
The
trick
was
to
catch
the
axe
or
leap
over
it
without
missing
a
step.
It
was
called
the
finger
dance
because
it
usually
ended
when
one
of
the
dancers
lost
one…
or
two,
or
five.

Neither
the
dancers
nor
the
drinkers
took
much
note
of
Theon
Greyjoy
as
he
strode
to
the
dais.
Lord
Balon
occupied
the
Seastone
Chair,
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
great
kraken
from
an
immense
block
of
oily
black
stone.
Legend
said
that
the
First
Men
had
found
it
standing
on
the
shore
of
Old
Wyk
when
they
came
to
the
Iron
Islands.
To
the
left
of
the
high
seat
were
Theon’s
uncles.
Asha
was
ensconced
at
his
right
hand,
in
the
place
of
honor.
“You
come
late,
Theon,”
Lord
Balon
observed.

“I
ask
your
pardon.”
Theon
took
the
empty
seat
beside
Asha.
Leaning
close,
he
hissed
in
her
ear,
“You’re
in
my
place.”

She
turned
to
him
with
innocent
eyes.
“Brother,
surely
you
are
mistaken.
Your
place
is
at
Winterfell.”
Her
smile
cut.
“And
where
are
all
your
pretty
clothes?
I
heard
you
fancied
silk
and
velvet
against
your
skin.”
She
was
in
soft
green
wool
herself,
simply
cut,
the
fabric
clinging
to
the
slender
lines
of
her
body.

“Your
hauberk
must
have
rusted
away,
sister,”
he
threw
back.
“A
great
pity.
I’d
like
to
see
you
all
in
iron.”

Asha
only
laughed.
“You
may
yet,
little
brother…
if
you
think
your
Sea
Bitch
can
keep
up
with
my
Black
Wind.”
One
of
their
father’s
thralls
came
near,
bearing
a
flagon
of
wine.
“Are
you
drinking
ale
or
wine
tonight,
Theon?”
She
leaned
over
close.
“Or
is
it
still
a
taste
of
my
mother’s
milk
you
thirst
for?”

He
flushed.
“Wine,”
he
told
the
thrall.
Asha
turned
away
and
banged
on
the
table,
shouting
for
ale.

Theon
hacked
a
loaf
of
bread
in
half,
hollowed
out
a
trencher,
and
summoned
a
cook
to
fill
it
with
fish
stew.
The
smell
of
the
thick
cream
made
him
a
little
ill,
but
he
forced
himself
to
eat
some.
He’d
drunk
enough
wine
to
float
him
through
two
meals.
If
I
retch,
it
will
be
on
her.
“Does
Father
know
that
you’ve
married
his
shipwright?”
he
asked
his
sister.

“No
more
than
Sigrin
does.”
She
gave
a
shrug.
“Esgred
was
the
first
ship
he
built.
He
named
her
after
his
mother.
I
would
be
hard-pressed
to
say
which
he
loves
best.”

“Every
word
you
spoke
to
me
was
a
lie.”

“Not
every
word.
Remember
when
I
told
you
I
like
to
be
on
top?”
Asha
grinned.

That
only
made
him
angrier.
“All
that
about
being
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
child…”

“Oh,
that
part
was
true
enough.”
Asha
leapt
to
her
feet.
“Rolfe,
here,”
she
shouted
down
at
one
of
the
finger
dancers,
holding
up
a
hand.
He
saw
her,
spun,
and
suddenly
an
axe
came
flying
from
his
hand,
the
blade
gleaming
as
it
tumbled
end
over
end
through
the
torchlight.
Theon
had
time
for
a
choked
gasp
before
Asha
snatched
the
axe
from
the
air
and
slammed
it
down
into
the
table,
splitting
his
trencher
in
two
and
splattering
his
mantle
with
drippings.
“There’s
my
lord
husband.”
His
sister
reached
down
inside
her
gown
and
drew
a
dirk
from
between
her
breasts.
“And
here’s
my
sweet
suckling
babe.”

He
could
not
imagine
how
he
looked
at
that
moment,
but
suddenly
Theon
Greyjoy
realized
that
the
Great
Hall
was
ringing
with
laughter,
all
of
it
at
him.
Even
his
father
was
smiling,
gods
be
damned,
and
his
uncle
Victarion
chuckled
aloud.
The
best
response
he
could
summon
was
a
queasy
grin.
We
shall
see
who
is
laughing
when
all
this
is
done,
bitch.

Asha
wrenched
the
axe
out
of
the
table
and
flung
it
back
down
at
the
dancers,
to
whistles
and
loud
cheers.
“You’d
do
well
to
heed
what
I
told
you
about
choosing
a
crew.”
A
thrall
offered
them
a
platter,
and
she
stabbed
a
salted
fish
and
ate
it
off
the
end
of
her
dirk.
“If
you
had
troubled
to
learn
the
first
thing
of
Sigrin,
I
could
never
have
fooled
you.
Ten
years
a
wolf,
and
you
land
here
and
think
to
prince
about
the
islands,
but
you
know
nothing
and
no
one.
Why
should
men
fight
and
die
for
you?
“

“I
am
their
lawful
prince,”
Theon
said
stiffly.

“By
the
laws
of
the
green
lands,
you
might
be.
But
we
make
our
own
laws
here,
or
have
you
forgotten?”

Scowling,
Theon
turned
to
contemplate
the
leaking
trencher
before
him.
He
would
have
stew
in
his
lap
before
long.
He
shouted
for
a
thrall
to
clean
it
up.
Half
my
life
I
have
waited
to
come
home,
and
for
what?
Mockery
and
disregard?
This
was
not
the
Pyke
he
remembered.
Or
did
he
remember?
He
had
been
so
young
when
they
took
him
away
to
hold
hostage.

The
feast
was
a
meager
enough
thing,
a
succession
of
fish
stews,
black
bread,
and
spiceless
goat.
The
tastiest
thing
Theon
found
to
eat
was
an
onion
pie.
Ale
and
wine
continued
to
flow
well
after
the
last
of
the
courses
had
been
cleared
away.

Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
rose
from
the
Seastone
Chair.
“Have
done
with
your
drink
and
come
to
my
solar,”
he
commanded
his
companions
on
the
dais.
“We
have
plans
to
lay.”
He
left
them
with
no
other
word,
flanked
by
two
of
his
guards.
His
brothers
followed
in
short
order.
Theon
rose
to
go
after
them.

“My
little
brother
is
in
a
rush
to
be
off.”
Asha
raised
her
drinking
horn
and
beckoned
for
more
ale.

“Our
lord
father
is
waiting.”

“And
has,
for
many
a
year.
It
will
do
him
no
harm
to
wait
a
little
longer…
but
if
you
fear
his
wrath,
scurry
after
him
by
all
means.
You
ought
to
have
no
trouble
catching
our
uncles.”
She
smiled.
“One
is
drunk
on
seawater,
after
all,
and
the
other
is
a
great
grey
bullock
so
dim
he’ll
probably
get
lost.”

Theon
sat
back
down,
annoyed.
“I
run
after
no
man.”

“No
man,
but
every
woman?”

“It
was
not
me
who
grabbed
your
cock.”

“I
don’t
have
one,
remember?
You
grabbed
every
other
bit
of
me
quick
enough.”

He
could
feel
the
flush
creeping
up
his
cheeks.
“I’m
a
man
with
a
man’s
hungers.
What
sort
of
unnatural
creature
are
you?”

“Only
a
shy
maid.”
Asha’s
hand
darted
out
under
the
table
to
give
his
cock
a
squeeze.
Theon
nearly
jumped
from
his
chair.
“What,
don’t
you
want
me
to
steer
you
into
port,
brother?”

“Marriage
is
not
for
you,”
Theon
decided.
“When
I
rule,
I
believe
I
will
pack
you
off
to
the
silent
sisters.”
He
lurched
to
his
feet
and
strode
off
unsteadily
to
find
his
father.

Rain
was
falling
by
the
time
he
reached
the
swaying
bridge
out
to
the
Sea
Tower.
His
stomach
was
crashing
and
churning
like
the
waves
below,
and
wine
had
unsteadied
his
feet.
Theon
gritted
his
teeth
and
gripped
the
rope
tightly
as
he
made
his
way
across,
pretending
that
it
was
Asha’s
neck
he
was
clutching.

The
solar
was
as
damp
and
drafty
as
ever.
Buried
under
his
sealskin
robes,
his
father
sat
before
the
brazier
with
his
brothers
on
either
side
of
him.
Victarion
was
talking
of
tides
and
winds
when
Theon
entered,
but
Lord
Balon
waved
him
silent.
“I
have
made
my
plans.
It
is
time
you
heard
them.”

“I
have
some
suggestions—”

“When
I
require
your
counsel
I
shall
ask
for
it,”
his
father
said.
“We
have
had
a
bird
from
Old
Wyk.
Dagmer
is
bringing
the
Drumms
and
Stonehouses.
If
the
god
grants
us
good
winds,
we
will
sail
when
they
arrive…
or
you
will.
I
mean
for
you
to
strike
the
first
blow,
Theon.
You
shall
take
eight
longships
north—”

“Eight?”
His
face
reddened.
“What
can
I
hope
to
accomplish
with
only
eight
longships?”

“You
are
to
harry
the
Stony
Shore,
raiding
the
fishing
villages
and
sinking
any
ships
you
chance
to
meet.
It
may
be
that
you
will
draw
some
of
the
northern
lords
out
from
behind
their
stone
walls.
Aeron
will
accompany
you,
and
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.”

“May
the
Drowned
God
bless
our
swords,”
the
priest
said.

Theon
felt
as
if
he’d
been
slapped.
He
was
being
sent
to
do
reaver’s
work,
burning
fishermen
out
of
their
hovels
and
raping
their
ugly
daughters,
and
yet
it
seemed
Lord
Balon
did
not
trust
him
sufficiently
to
do
even
that
much.
Bad
enough
to
have
to
suffer
the
Damphair’s
scowls
and
chidings.
With
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
along
as
well,
his
command
would
be
purely
nominal.

“Asha
my
daughter,”
Lord
Balon
went
on,
and
Theon
turned
to
see
that
his
sister
had
slipped
in
silently,
“you
shall
take
thirty
longships
of
picked
men
round
Sea
Dragon
Point.
Land
upon
the
tidal
flats
north
of
Deepwood
Motte.
March
quickly,
and
the
castle
may
fall
before
they
even
know
you
are
upon
them.”

Asha
smiled
like
a
cat
in
cream.
“I’ve
always
wanted
a
castle,”
she
said
sweetly.

“Then
take
one.”

Theon
had
to
bite
his
tongue.
Deepwood
Motte
was
the
stronghold
of
the
Glovers.
With
both
Robett
and
Galbart
warring
in
the
south,
it
would
be
lightly
held,
and
once
the
castle
fell
the
ironmen
would
have
a
secure
base
in
the
heart
of
the
north.
I
should
be
the
one
sent
to
take
Deepwood.
He
knew
Deepwood
Motte,
he
had
visited
the
Glovers
several
times
with
Eddard
Stark.

“Victarion,”
Lord
Balon
said
to
his
brother,
“the
main
thrust
shall
fall
to
you.
When
my
sons
have
struck
their
blows,
Winterfell
must
respond.
You
should
meet
small
opposition
as
you
sail
up
Saltspear
and
the
Fever
River.
At
the
headwaters,
you
will
be
less
than
twenty
miles
from
Moat
Cailin.
The
Neck
is
the
key
to
the
kingdom.
Already
we
command
the
western
seas.
Once
we
hold
Moat
Cailin,
the
pup
will
not
be
able
to
win
back
to
the
north…
and
if
he
is
fool
enough
to
try,
his
enemies
will
seal
the
south
end
of
the
causeway
behind
him,
and
Robb
the
boy
will
find
himself
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
bottle.”

Theon
could
keep
silent
no
longer.
“A
bold
plan,
Father,
but
the
lords
in
their
castles—”

Lord
Balon
rode
over
him.
“The
lords
are
gone
south
with
the
pup.
Those
who
remained
behind
are
the
cravens,
old
men,
and
green
boys.
They
will
yield
or
fall,
one
by
one.
Winterfell
may
defy
us
for
a
year,
but
what
of
it?
The
rest
shall
be
ours,
forest
and
field
and
hall,
and
we
shall
make
the
folk
our
thralls
and
salt
wives.”

Aeron
Damphair
raised
his
arms.
“And
the
waters
of
wrath
will
rise
high,
and
the
Drowned
God
will
spread
his
dominion
across
the
green
lands!”

“What
is
dead
can
never
die,”
Victarion
intoned.
Lord
Balon
and
Asha
echoed
his
words,
and
Theon
had
no
choice
but
to
mumble
along
with
them.
And
then
it
was
done.

Outside
the
rain
was
falling
harder
than
ever.
The
rope
bridge
twisted
and
writhed
under
his
feet.
Theon
Greyjoy
stopped
in
the
center
of
the
span
and
contemplated
the
rocks
below.
The
sound
of
the
waves
was
a
crashing
roar,
and
he
could
taste
the
salt
spray
on
his
lips.
A
sudden
gust
of
wind
made
him
lose
his
footing,
and
he
stumbled
to
his
knees.

Asha
helped
him
rise.
“You
can’t
hold
your
wine
either,
brother.”

Theon
leaned
on
her
shoulder
and
let
her
guide
him
across
the
rainslick
boards.
“I
liked
you
better
when
you
were
Esgred,”
he
told
her
accusingly.

She
laughed.
“That’s
fair.
I
liked
you
better
when
you
were
nine.”





TYRION

Through
the
door
came
the
soft
sound
of
the
high
harp,
mingled
with
a
trilling
of
pipes.
The
singer’s
voice
was
muffled
by
the
thick
walls,
yet
Tyrion
knew
the
verse.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
he
remembered,
with
sunlight
in
her
hair…

Ser
Meryn
Trant
guarded
the
queen’s
door
this
night.
His
muttered
“My
lord”
struck
Tyrion
as
a
tad
grudging,
but
he
opened
the
door
nonetheless.
The
song
broke
off
abruptly
as
he
strode
into
his
sister’s
bedchamber.

Cersei
was
reclining
on
a
pile
of
cushions.
Her
feet
were
bare,
her
golden
hair
artfully
tousled,
her
robe
a
green-and-gold
samite
that
caught
the
light
of
the
candles
and
shimmered
as
she
looked
up.
“Sweet
sister,”
Tyrion
said,
“how
beautiful
you
look
tonight.”
He
turned
to
the
singer.
“And
you
as
well,
cousin.
I
had
no
notion
you
had
such
a
lovely
voice.”

The
compliment
made
Ser
Lancel
sulky;
perhaps
he
thought
he
was
being
mocked.
It
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
the
lad
had
grown
three
inches
since
being
knighted.
Lancel
had
thick
sandy
hair,
green
Lannister
eyes,
and
a
line
of
soft
blond
fuzz
on
his
upper
lip.
At
sixteen,
he
was
cursed
with
all
the
certainty
of
youth,
unleavened
by
any
trace
of
humor
or
self-doubt,
and
wed
to
the
arrogance
that
came
so
naturally
to
those
born
blond
and
strong
and
handsome.
His
recent
elevation
had
only
made
him
worse.
“Did
Her
Grace
send
for
you?”
the
boy
demanded.

“Not
that
I
recall,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“It
grieves
me
to
disturb
your
revels,
Lancel,
but
as
it
happens,
I
have
matters
of
import
to
discuss
with
my
sister.”

Cersei
regarded
him
suspiciously.
“If
you
are
here
about
those
begging
brothers,
Tyrion,
spare
me
your
reproaches.
I
won’t
have
them
spreading
their
filthy
treasons
in
the
streets.
They
can
preach
to
each
other
in
the
dungeons.”

“And
count
themselves
lucky
that
they
have
such
a
gentle
queen,”
added
Lancel.
“I
would
have
had
their
tongues
out.”

“One
even
dared
to
say
that
the
gods
were
punishing
us
because
Jaime
murdered
the
rightful
king,”
Cersei
declared.
“It
will
not
be
borne,
Tyrion.
I
gave
you
ample
opportunity
to
deal
with
these
lice,
but
you
and
your
Ser
Jacelyn
did
nothing,
so
I
commanded
Vylarr
to
attend
to
the
matter.”

“And
so
he
did.”
Tyrion
had
been
annoyed
when
the
red
cloaks
had
dragged
a
half
dozen
of
the
scabrous
prophets
down
to
the
dungeons
without
consulting
him,
but
they
were
not
important
enough
to
battle
over.
“No
doubt
we
will
all
be
better
off
for
a
little
quiet
in
the
streets.
That
is
not
why
I
came.
I
have
tidings
I
know
you
will
be
anxious
to
hear,
sweet
sister,
but
they
are
best
spoken
of
privily.”

“Very
well.”
The
harpist
and
the
piper
bowed
and
hurried
out,
while
Cersei
kissed
her
cousin
chastely
on
the
cheek.
“Leave
us,
Lancel.
My
brother’s
harmless
when
he’s
alone.
If
he’d
brought
his
pets,
we’d
smell
them.”

The
young
knight
gave
his
cousin
a
baleful
glance
and
pulled
the
door
shut
forcefully
behind
him.
“I’ll
have
you
know
I
make
Shagga
bathe
once
a
fortnight,”
Tyrion
said
when
he
was
gone.

“You’re
very
pleased
with
yourself,
aren’t
you?
Why?”

“Why
not?”
Tyrion
said.
Every
day,
every
night,
hammers
rang
along
the
Street
of
Steel,
and
the
great
chain
grew
longer.
He
hopped
up
onto
the
great
canopied
bed.
“Is
this
the
bed
where
Robert
died?
I’m
surprised
you
kept
it.”

“It
gives
me
sweet
dreams,”
she
said.
“Now
spit
out
your
business
and
waddle
away,
Imp.”

Tyrion
smiled.
“Lord
Stannis
has
sailed
from
Dragonstone.”

Cersei
bolted
to
her
feet.
“And
yet
you
sit
there
grinning
like
a
harvest-day
pumpkin?
Has
Bywater
called
out
the
City
Watch?
We
must
send
a
bird
to
Harrenhal
at
once.”
He
was
laughing
by
then.
She
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him.
“Stop
it.
Are
you
mad,
or
drunk?
Stop
it!”

It
was
all
he
could
do
to
get
out
the
words.
“I
can’t,”
he
gasped.
“It’s
too…
gods,
too
funny…
Stannis…”

“What?”

“He
hasn’t
sailed
against
us,”
Tyrion
managed.
“He’s
laid
siege
to
Storm’s
End.
Renly
is
riding
to
meet
him.”

His
sister’s
nails
dug
painfully
into
his
arms.
For
a
moment
she
stared
incredulous,
as
if
he
had
begun
to
gibber
in
an
unknown
tongue.
“Stannis
and
Renly
are
fighting
each
other?”
When
he
nodded,
Cersei
began
to
chuckle.
“Gods
be
good,”
she
gasped,
“I’m
starting
to
believe
that
Robert
was
the
clever
one.”

Tyrion
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
They
laughed
together.
Cersei
pulled
him
off
the
bed
and
whirled
him
around
and
even
hugged
him,
for
a
moment
as
giddy
as
a
girl.
By
the
time
she
let
go
of
him,
Tyrion
was
breathless
and
dizzy.
He
staggered
to
her
sideboard
and
put
out
a
hand
to
steady
himself.

“Do
you
think
it
will
truly
come
to
battle
between
them?
If
they
should
come
to
some
accord—”

“They
won’t,”
Tyrion
said.
“They
are
too
different
and
yet
too
much
alike,
and
neither
could
ever
stomach
the
other.”

“And
Stannis
has
always
felt
he
was
cheated
of
Storm’s
End,”
Cersei
said
thoughtfully.
“The
ancestral
seat
of
House
Baratheon,
his
by
rights…
if
you
knew
how
many
times
he
came
to
Robert
singing
that
same
dull
song
in
that
gloomy
aggrieved
tone
he
has.
When
Robert
gave
the
place
to
Renly,
Stannis
clenched
his
jaw
so
tight
I
thought
his
teeth
would
shatter.”

“He
took
it
as
a
slight.”

“It
was
meant
as
a
slight,”
Cersei
said.

“Shall
we
raise
a
cup
to
brotherly
love?”

“Yes,”
she
answered,
breathless.
“Oh,
gods,
yes.”

His
back
was
to
her
as
he
filled
two
cups
with
sweet
Arbor
red.
It
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
sprinkle
a
pinch
of
fine
powder
into
hers.
“To
Stannis!”
he
said
as
he
handed
her
the
wine.
Harmless
when
I’m
alone,
am
I?

“To
Renly!”
she
replied,
laughing.
“May
they
battle
long
and
hard,
and
the
Others
take
them
both!”

Is
this
the
Cersei
that
Jaime
sees?
When
she
smiled,
you
saw
how
beautiful
she
was,
truly.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
with
sunlight
in
her
hair.
He
almost
felt
sorry
for
poisoning
her.

It
was
the
next
morning
as
he
broke
his
fast
that
her
messenger
arrived.
The
queen
was
indisposed
and
would
not
be
able
to
leave
her
chambers.
Not
able
to
leave
her
privy,
more
like.
Tyrion
made
the
proper
sympathetic
noises
and
sent
word
to
Cersei
to
rest
easy,
he
would
treat
with
Ser
Cleos
as
they’d
planned.

The
Iron
Throne
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
was
a
tangle
of
nasty
barbs
and
jagged
metal
teeth
waiting
for
any
fool
who
tried
to
sit
too
comfortably,
and
the
steps
made
his
stunted
legs
cramp
as
he
climbed
up
to
it,
all
too
aware
of
what
an
absurd
spectacle
he
must
be.
Yet
there
was
one
thing
to
be
said
for
it.
It
was
high.

Lannister
guardsmen
stood
silent
in
their
crimson
cloaks
and
lioncrested
halfhelms.
Ser
Jacelyn’s
gold
cloaks
faced
them
across
the
hall.
The
steps
to
the
throne
were
flanked
by
Bronn
and
Ser
Preston
of
the
Kingsguard.
Courtiers
filled
the
gallery
while
supplicants
clustered
near
the
towering
oak-and-bronze
doors.
Sansa
Stark
looked
especially
lovely
this
morning,
though
her
face
was
as
pale
as
milk.
Lord
Gyles
stood
coughing,
while
poor
cousin
Tyrek
wore
his
bridegroom’s
mantle
of
miniver
and
velvet.
Since
his
marriage
to
little
Lady
Ermesande
three
days
past,
the
other
squires
had
taken
to
calling
him
“Wet
Nurse”
and
asking
him
what
sort
of
swaddling
clothes
his
bride
wore
on
their
wedding
night.

Tyrion
looked
down
on
them
all,
and
found
he
liked
it.
“Call
forth
Ser
Cleos
Frey.”
His
voice
rang
off
the
stone
walls
and
down
the
length
of
the
hall.
He
liked
that
too.
A
pity
Shae
could
not
be
here
to
see
this,
he
reflected.
She’d
asked
to
come,
but
it
was
impossible.

Ser
Cleos
made
the
long
walk
between
the
gold
cloaks
and
the
crimson,
looking
neither
right
nor
left.
As
he
knelt,
Tyrion
observed
that
his
cousin
was
losing
his
hair.

“Ser
Cleos,”
Littlefinger
said
from
the
council
table,
“you
have
our
thanks
for
bringing
us
this
peace
offer
from
Lord
Stark.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat.
“The
Queen
Regent,
the
King’s
Hand,
and
the
small
council
have
considered
the
terms
offered
by
this
self-styled
King
in
the
North.
Sad
to
say,
they
will
not
do,
and
you
must
tell
these
northmen
so,
ser.”

“Here
are
our
terms,”
said
Tyrion.
“Robb
Stark
must
lay
down
his
sword,
swear
fealty,
and
return
to
Winterfell.
He
must
free
my
brother
unharmed,
and
place
his
host
under
Jaime’s
command,
to
march
against
the
rebels
Renly
and
Stannis
Baratheon.
Each
of
Stark’s
bannermen
must
send
us
a
son
as
hostage.
A
daughter
will
suffice
where
there
is
no
son.
They
shall
be
treated
gently
and
given
high
places
here
at
court,
so
long
as
their
fathers
commit
no
new
treasons.”

Cleos
Frey
looked
ill.
“My
lord
Hand,”
he
said,
“Lord
Stark
will
never
consent
to
these
terms.”

We
never
expected
he
would,
Cleos.
“Tell
him
that
we
have
raised
another
great
host
at
Casterly
Rock,
that
soon
it
will
march
on
him
from
the
west
while
my
lord
father
advances
from
the
east.
Tell
him
that
he
stands
alone,
without
hope
of
allies.
Stannis
and
Renly
Baratheon
war
against
each
other,
and
the
Prince
of
Dorne
has
consented
to
wed
his
son
Trystane
to
the
Princess
Myrcella.”
Murmurs
of
delight
and
consternation
alike
arose
from
the
gallery
and
the
back
of
the
hall.

“As
to
this
of
my
cousins,”
Tyrion
went
on,
“we
offer
Harrion
Karstark
and
Ser
Wylis
Manderly
for
Willem
Lannister,
and
Lord
Cerwyn
and
Ser
Donnel
Locke
for
your
brother
Tion.
Tell
Stark
that
two
Lannisters
are
worth
four
northmen
in
any
season.”
He
waited
for
the
laughter
to
die.
“His
father’s
bones
he
shall
have,
as
a
gesture
of
Joffrey’s
good
faith.”

“Lord
Stark
asked
for
his
sisters
and
his
father’s
sword
as
well,”
Ser
Cleos
reminded
him.

Ser
Ilyn
Payne
stood
mute,
the
hilt
of
Eddard
Stark’s
greatsword
rising
over
one
shoulder.
“Ice,”
said
Tyrion.
“He’ll
have
that
when
he
makes
his
peace
with
us,
not
before.”

“As
you
say.
And
his
sisters?”

Tyrion
glanced
toward
Sansa,
and
felt
a
stab
of
pity
as
he
said,
“Until
such
time
as
he
frees
my
brother
Jaime,
unharmed,
they
shall
remain
here
as
hostages.
How
well
they
are
treated
depends
on
him.”
And
if
the
gods
are
good,
Bywater
will
find
Arya
alive,
before
Robb
learns
she’s
gone
missing.

“I
shall
bring
him
your
message,
my
lord.”

Tyrion
plucked
at
one
of
the
twisted
blades
that
sprang
from
the
arm
of
the
throne.
And
now
the
thrust.
“Vylarr,”
he
called.

“My
lord.”

“The
men
Stark
sent
are
sufficient
to
protect
Lord
Eddard’s
bones,
but
a
Lannister
should
have
a
Lannister
escort,”
Tyrion
declared.
“Ser
Cleos
is
the
queen’s
cousin,
and
mine.
We
shall
sleep
more
easily
if
you
would
see
him
safely
back
to
Riverrun.”

“As
you
command.
How
many
men
should
I
take?”

“Why,
all
of
them.”

Vylarr
stood
like
a
man
made
of
stone.
It
was
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
who
rose,
gasping,
“My
lord
Hand,
that
cannot…
your
father,
Lord
Tywin
himself,
he
sent
these
good
men
to
our
city
to
protect
Queen
Cersei
and
her
children…”

“The
Kingsguard
and
the
City
Watch
protect
them
well
enough.
The
gods
speed
you
on
your
way,
Vylarr.”

At
the
council
table
Varys
smiled
knowingly,
Littlefinger
sat
feigning
boredom,
and
Pycelle
gaped
like
a
fish,
pale
and
confused.
A
herald
stepped
forward.
“If
any
man
has
other
matters
to
set
before
the
King’s
Hand,
let
him
speak
now
or
go
forth
and
hold
his
silence.”

“I
will
be
heard.”
A
slender
man
all
in
black
pushed
his
way
between
the
Redwyne
twins.

“Ser
Alliser!”
Tyrion
exclaimed.
“Why,
I
had
no
notion
that
you’d
come
to
court.
You
should
have
sent
me
word.”

“I
have,
as
well
you
know.”
Thorne
was
as
prickly
as
his
name,
a
spare,
sharp-featured
man
of
fifty,
hard-eyed
and
hard-handed,
his
black
hair
streaked
with
grey.
“I
have
been
shunned,
ignored,
and
left
to
wait
like
some
baseborn
servant.”

“Truly?
Bronn,
this
was
not
well
done.
Ser
Alliser
and
I
are
old
friends.
We
walked
the
Wall
together.”

“Sweet
Ser
Alliser,”
murmured
Varys,
“you
must
not
think
too
harshly
of
us.
So
many
seek
our
Joffrey’s
grace,
in
these
troubled
and
tumultuous
times.”

“More
troubled
than
you
know,
eunuch.”

“To
his
face
we
call
him
Lord
Eunuch,”
quipped
Littlefinger.

“How
may
we
be
of
help
to
you,
good
brother?”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
asked
in
soothing
tones.

“The
Lord
Commander
sent
me
to
His
Grace
the
king,”
Thorne
answered.
“The
matter
is
too
grave
to
be
left
to
servants.”

“The
king
is
playing
with
his
new
crossbow,”
Tyrion
said.
Ridding
himself
of
Joffrey
had
required
only
an
ungainly
Myrish
crossbow
that
threw
three
quarrels
at
a
time,
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
he
try
it
at
once.
“You
can
speak
to
servants
or
hold
your
silence.”

“As
you
will,”
Ser
Alliser
said,
displeasure
in
every
word.
“I
am
sent
to
tell
you
that
we
found
two
rangers,
long
missing.
They
were
dead,
yet
when
we
brought
the
corpses
back
to
the
Wall
they
rose
again
in
the
night.
One
slew
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
while
the
second
tried
to
murder
the
Lord
Commander.”

Distantly,
Tyrion
heard
someone
snigger.
Does
he
mean
to
mock
me
with
this
folly?
He
shifted
uneasily
and
glanced
down
at
Varys,
Littlefinger,
and
Pycelle,
wondering
if
one
of
them
had
a
role
in
this.
A
dwarf
enjoyed
at
best
a
tenuous
hold
on
dignity.
Once
the
court
and
kingdom
started
to
laugh
at
him,
he
was
doomed.
And
yet…
and
yet…

Tyrion
remembered
a
cold
night
under
the
stars
when
he’d
stood
beside
the
boy
Jon
Snow
and
a
great
white
wolf
atop
the
Wall
at
the
end
of
the
world,
gazing
out
at
the
trackless
dark
beyond.
He
had
felt—what?—something,
to
be
sure,
a
dread
that
had
cut
like
that
frigid
northern
wind.
A
wolf
had
howled
off
in
the
night,
and
the
sound
had
sent
a
shiver
through
him.

Don’t
be
a
fool,
he
told
himself.
A
wolf,
a
wind,
a
dark
forest,
it
meant
nothing.
And
yet…
He
had
come
to
have
a
liking
for
old
Jeor
Mormont
during
his
time
at
Castle
Black.
“I
trust
that
the
Old
Bear
survived
this
attack?”

“He
did.”

“And
that
your
brothers
killed
these,
ah,
dead
men?”

“We
did.”

“You’re
certain
that
they
are
dead
this
time?”
Tyrion
asked
mildly.
When
Bronn
choked
on
a
snort
of
laughter,
he
knew
how
he
must
proceed.
“Truly
truly
dead?”

“They
were
dead
the
first
time,”
Ser
Alliser
snapped.
“Pale
and
cold,
with
black
hands
and
feet.
I
brought
Jared’s
hand,
torn
from
his
corpse
by
the
bastard’s
wolf.”

Littlefinger
stirred.
“And
where
is
this
charming
token?”

Ser
Alliser
frowned
uncomfortably.
“It…
rotted
to
pieces
while
I
waited,
unheard.
There’s
naught
left
to
show
but
bones.”

Titters
echoed
through
the
hall.
“Lord
Baelish,”
Tyrion
called
down
to
Littlefinger,
“buy
our
brave
Ser
Alliser
a
hundred
spades
to
take
back
to
the
Wall
with
him.”

“Spades?”
Ser
Alliser
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously.

“If
you
bury
your
dead,
they
won’t
come
walking,”
Tyrion
told
him,
and
the
court
laughed
openly.
“Spades
will
end
your
troubles,
with
some
strong
backs
to
wield
them.
Ser
Jacelyn,
see
that
the
good
brother
has
his
pick
of
the
city
dungeons.”

Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
said,
“As
you
will,
my
lord,
but
the
cells
are
near
empty.
Yoren
took
all
the
likely
men.”

“Arrest
some
more,
then,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“Or
spread
the
word
that
there’s
bread
and
turnips
on
the
Wall,
and
they’ll
go
of
their
own
accord.”
The
city
had
too
many
mouths
to
feed,
and
the
Night’s
Watch
a
perpetual
need
of
men.
At
Tyrion’s
signal,
the
herald
cried
an
end,
and
the
hall
began
to
empty.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
not
so
easily
dismissed.
He
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
iron
Throne
when
Tyrion
descended.
“Do
you
think
I
sailed
all
the
way
from
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
to
be
mocked
by
the
likes
of
you?”
he
fumed,
blocking
the
way.
“This
is
no
jape.
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes.
I
tell
you,
the
dead
walk.”

“You
should
try
to
kill
them
more
thoroughly.”
Tyrion
pushed
past.
Ser
Alliser
made
to
grab
his
sleeve,
but
Preston
Greenfield
thrust
him
back.
“No
closer,
ser.”

Thorne
knew
better
than
to
challenge
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
“You
are
a
fool,
Imp,”
he
shouted
at
Tyrion’s
back.

The
dwarf
turned
to
face
him.
“Me?
Truly?
Then
why
were
they
laughing
at
you,
I
wonder?”
He
smiled
wanly.
“You
came
for
men,
did
you
not?”

“The
cold
winds
are
rising.
The
Wall
must
be
held.”

“And
to
hold
it
you
need
men,
which
I’ve
given
you…
as
you
might
have
noted,
if
your
ears
heard
anything
but
insults.
Take
them,
thank
me,
and
begone
before
I’m
forced
to
take
a
crab
fork
to
you
again.
Give
my
warm
regards
to
Lord
Mormont…
and
to
Jon
Snow
as
well.”
Bronn
seized
Ser
Alliser
by
the
elbow
and
marched
him
forcefully
from
the
hall.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
already
scuttled
off,
but
Varys
and
Littlefinger
had
watched
it
all,
start
to
finish.
“I
grow
ever
more
admiring
of
you,
my
lord,”
confessed
the
eunuch.
“You
appease
the
Stark
boy
with
his
father’s
bones
and
strip
your
sister
of
her
protectors
in
one
swift
stroke.
You
give
that
black
brother
the
men
he
seeks,
rid
the
city
of
some
hungry
mouths,
yet
make
it
all
seem
mockery
so
none
may
say
that
the
dwarf
fears
snarks
and
grumkins.
Oh,
deftly
done.”

Littlefinger
stroked
his
beard.
“Do
you
truly
mean
to
send
away
all
your
guards,
Lannister?”

“No,
I
mean
to
send
away
all
my
sister’s
guards.”

“The
queen
will
never
allow
that.”

“Oh,
I
think
she
may.
I
am
her
brother,
and
when
you’ve
known
me
longer,
you’ll
learn
that
I
mean
everything
I
say.”

“Even
the
lies?”

“Especially
the
lies.
Lord
Petyr,
I
sense
that
you
are
unhappy
with
me.”

“I
love
you
as
much
as
I
ever
have,
my
lord.
Though
I
do
not
relish
being
played
for
a
fool.
if
Myrcella
weds
Trystane
Martell,
she
can
scarcely
wed
Robert
Arryn,
can
she?”

“Not
without
causing
a
great
scandal,”
he
admitted.
“I
regret
my
little
ruse,
Lord
Petyr,
but
when
we
spoke,
I
could
not
know
the
Dornishmen
would
accept
my
offer.”

Littlefinger
was
not
appeased.
“I
do
not
like
being
lied
to,
my
lord.
Leave
me
out
of
your
next
deception.”

Only
if
you’ll
do
the
same
for
me,
Tyrion
thought,
glancing
at
the
dagger
sheathed
at
Littlefinger’s
hip.
“If
I
have
given
offense,
I
am
deeply
sorry.
All
men
know
how
much
we
love
you,
my
lord.
And
how
much
we
need
you.”

“Try
and
remember
that.”
With
that
Littlefinger
left
them.

“Walk
with
me,
Varys,”
said
Tyrion.
They
left
through
the
king’s
door
behind
the
throne,
the
eunuch’s
slippers
whisking
lightly
over
the
stone.

“Lord
Baelish
has
the
truth
of
it,
you
know.
The
queen
will
never
permit
you
to
send
away
her
guard.”

“She
will.
You’ll
see
to
that.”

A
smile
flickered
across
Varys’s
plump
lips.
“Will
I?”

“Oh,
for
a
certainty.
You’ll
tell
her
it
is
part
of
my
scheme
to
free
Jaime.”

Varys
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
“This
would
doubtless
involve
the
four
men
your
man
Bronn
searched
for
so
diligently
in
all
the
low
places
of
King’s
Landing.
A
thief,
a
poisoner,
a
mummer,
and
a
murderer.”

“Put
them
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion
helms,
they’ll
look
no
different
from
any
other
guardsmen.
I
searched
for
some
time
for
a
ruse
that
might
get
them
into
Riverrun
before
I
thought
to
hide
them
in
plain
sight.
They’ll
ride
in
by
the
main
gate,
flying
Lannister
banners
and
escorting
Lord
Eddard’s
bones.”
He
smiled
crookedly.
“Four
men
alone
would
be
watched
vigilantly.
Four
among
a
hundred
can
lose
themselves.
So
I
must
send
the
true
guardsmen
as
well
as
the
false…
as
you’ll
tell
my
sister.”

“And
for
the
sake
of
her
beloved
brother,
she
will
consent,
despite
her
misgivings.”
They
made
their
way
down
a
deserted
colonnade.
“Still,
the
loss
of
her
red
cloaks
will
surely
make
her
uneasy.”

“I
like
her
uneasy,”
said
Tyrion.

Ser
Cleos
Frey
left
that
very
afternoon,
escorted
by
Vylarr
and
a
hundred
red-cloaked
Lannister
guardsmen.
The
men
Robb
Stark
had
sent
joined
them
at
the
King’s
Gate
for
the
long
ride
west.

Tyrion
found
Timett
dicing
with
his
Burned
Men
in
the
barracks.
“Come
to
my
solar
at
midnight.”
Timett
gave
him
a
hard
one-eyed
stare,
a
curt
nod.
He
was
not
one
for
long
speeches.

That
night
he
feasted
with
the
Stone
Crows
and
Moon
Brothers
in
the
Small
Hall,
though
he
shunned
the
wine
for
once.
He
wanted
all
his
wits
about
him.
“Shagga,
what
moon
is
this?”

Shagga’s
frown
was
a
fierce
thing.
“Black,
I
think.”

“In
the
west,
they
call
that
a
traitor’s
moon.
Try
not
to
get
too
drunk
tonight,
and
see
that
your
axe
is
sharp.”

“A
Stone
Crow’s
axe
is
always
sharp,
and
Shagga’s
axes
are
sharpest
of
all.
Once
I
cut
off
a
man’s
head,
but
he
did
not
know
it
until
he
tried
to
brush
his
hair.
Then
it
fell
off.”

“Is
that
why
you
never
brush
yours?”
The
Stone
Crows
roared
and
stamped
their
feet,
Shagga
hooting
loudest
of
all.

By
midnight,
the
castle
was
silent
and
dark.
Doubtless
a
few
gold
cloaks
on
the
walls
spied
them
leaving
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
no
one
raised
a
voice.
He
was
the
Hand
of
the
King,
and
where
he
went
was
his
own
affair.

The
thin
wooden
door
split
with
a
thunderous
crack
beneath
the
heel
of
Shagga’s
boot.
Pieces
went
flying
inward,
and
Tyrion
heard
a
woman’s
gasp
of
fear.
Shagga
hacked
the
door
apart
with
three
great
blows
of
his
axe
and
kicked
his
way
through
the
ruins.
Timett
followed,
and
then
Tyrion,
stepping
gingerly
over
the
splinters.
The
fire
had
burned
down
a
few
glowing
embers,
and
shadows
lay
thick
across
the
bedchamber.
When
Timett
ripped
the
heavy
curtains
off
the
bed,
the
naked
serving
girl
stared
up
with
wide
white
eyes.
“Please,
my
lords,”
she
pleaded,
“don’t
hurt
me.”
She
cringed
away
from
Shagga,
flushed
and
fearful,
trying
to
cover
her
charms
with
her
hands
and
coming
up
a
hand
short.

“Go,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“It’s
not
you
we
want.”

“Shagga
wants
this
woman.”

“Shagga
wants
every
whore
in
this
city
of
whores,”
complained
Timett
son
of
Timett.

“Yes,”
Shagga
said,
unabashed.
“Shagga
would
give
her
a
strong
child.”

“If
she
wants
a
strong
child,
she’ll
know
whom
to
seek,”
Tyrion
said.
“Timett,
see
her
out…
gently,
if
you
would.”

The
Burned
Man
pulled
the
girl
from
the
bed
and
half
marched,
half
dragged
her
across
the
chamber.
Shagga
watched
them
go,
mournful
as
a
puppy.
The
girl
stumbled
over
the
shattered
door
and
out
into
the
hall,
helped
along
by
a
firm
shove
from
Timett.
Above
their
heads,
the
ravens
were
screeching.

Tyrion
dragged
the
soft
blanket
off
the
bed,
uncovering
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
beneath.
“Tell
me,
does
the
Citadel
approve
of
you
bedding
the
serving
wenches,
Maester?”

The
old
man
was
as
naked
as
the
girl,
though
he
made
a
markedly
less
attractive
sight.
For
once,
his
heavy-lidded
eyes
were
open
wide.
“W-what
is
the
meaning
of
this?
I
am
an
old
man,
your
loyal
servant…”

Tyrion
hoisted
himself
onto
the
bed.
“So
loyal
that
you
sent
only
one
of
my
letters
to
Doran
Martell.
The
other
you
gave
to
my
sister.”

“N-no,”
squealed
Pycelle.
“No,
a
falsehood,
I
swear
it,
it
was
not
me.
Varys,
it
was
Varys,
the
Spider,
I
warned
you—”

“Do
all
maesters
lie
so
poorly?
I
told
Varys
that
I
was
giving
Prince
Doran
my
nephew
Tommen
to
foster.
I
told
Littlefinger
that
I
planned
to
wed
Myrcella
to
Lord
Robert
of
the
Eyrie.
I
told
no
one
that
I
had
offered
Myrcella
to
the
Dornish…
that
truth
was
only
in
the
letter
I
entrusted
to
you.”

Pycelle
clutched
for
a
corner
of
the
blanket.
“Birds
are
lost,
messages
stolen
or
sold…
it
was
Varys,
there
are
things
I
might
tell
you
of
that
eunuch
that
would
chill
your
blood…”

“My
lady
prefers
my
blood
hot.”

“Make
no
mistake,
for
every
secret
the
eunuch
whispers
in
your
ear,
he
holds
seven
back.
And
Littlefinger,
that
one…”

“I
know
all
about
Lord
Petyr.
He’s
almost
as
untrustworthy
as
you.
Shagga,
cut
off
his
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats.”

Shagga
hefted
the
huge
double-bladed
axe.
“There
are
no
goats,
Halfman.”

“Make
do.”

Roaring,
Shagga
leapt
forward.
Pycelle
shrieked
and
wet
the
bed,
urine
spraying
in
all
directions
as
he
tried
to
scramble
back
out
of
reach.
The
wildling
caught
him
by
the
end
of
his
billowy
white
beard
and
hacked
off
three-quarters
of
it
with
a
single
slash
of
the
axe.

“Timett,
do
you
suppose
our
friend
will
be
more
forthcoming
without
those
whiskers
to
hide
behind?”
Tyrion
used
a
bit
of
the
sheet
to
wipe
the
piss
off
his
boots.

“He
will
tell
the
truth
soon.”
Darkness
pooled
in
the
empty
pit
of
Timett’s
burned
eye.
“I
can
smell
the
stink
of
his
fear.”

Shagga
tossed
a
handful
of
hair
down
to
the
rushes,
and
seized
what
beard
was
left.
“Hold
still,
Maester,”
urged
Tyrion.
“When
Shagga
gets
angry,
his
hands
shake.”

“Shagga’s
hands
never
shake,”
the
huge
man
said
indignantly,
pressing
the
great
crescent
blade
under
Pycelle’s
quivering
chin
and
sawing
through
another
tangle
of
beard.

“How
long
have
you
been
spying
for
my
sister?”
Tyrion
asked.

Pycelle’s
breathing
was
rapid
and
shallow.
“All
I
did,
I
did
for
House
Lannister.”
A
sheen
of
sweat
covered
the
broad
dome
of
the
old
man’s
brow,
and
wisps
of
white
hair
clung
to
his
wrinkled
skin.
“Always…
for
years…
your
lord
father,
ask
him,
I
was
ever
his
true
servant…’twas
I
who
bid
Aerys
open
his
gates…”

That
took
Tyrion
by
surprise.
He
had
been
no
more
than
an
ugly
boy
at
Casterly
Rock
when
the
city
fell.
“So
the
Sack
of
King’s
Landing
was
your
work
as
well?”

“For
the
realm!
Once
Rhaegar
died,
the
war
was
done.
Aerys
was
mad,
Viserys
too
young,
Prince
Aegon
a
babe
at
the
breast,
but
the
realm
needed
a
king…
I
prayed
it
should
be
your
good
father,
but
Robert
was
too
strong,
and
Lord
Stark
moved
too
swiftly…”

“How
many
have
you
betrayed,
I
wonder?
Aerys,
Eddard
Stark,
me…
King
Robert
as
well?
Lord
Arryn,
Prince
Rhaegar?
Where
does
it
begin,
Pycelle?”
He
knew
where
it
ended.

The
axe
scratched
at
the
apple
of
Pycelle’s
throat
and
stroked
the
soft
wobbly
skin
under
his
jaw,
scraping
away
the
last
hairs.
“You…
were
not
here,”
he
gasped
when
the
blade
moved
upward
to
his
cheeks.
“Robert…
his
wounds…
if
you
had
seen
them,
smelled
them,
you
would
have
no
doubt…”

“Oh,
I
know
the
boar
did
your
work
for
you…
but
if
he’d
left
the
job
half
done,
doubtless
you
would
have
finished
it.”

“He
was
a
wretched
king…
vain,
drunken,
lecherous…
he
would
have
set
your
sister
aside,
his
own
queen…
please…
Renly
was
plotting
to
bring
the
Highgarden
maid
to
court,
to
entice
his
brother…
it
is
the
gods’
own
truth…”

“And
what
was
Lord
Arryn
plotting?”

“He
knew,”
Pycelle
said.
“About…
about…”

“I
know
what
he
knew
about,”
snapped
Tyrion,
who
was
not
anxious
for
Shagga
and
Timett
to
know
as
well.

“He
was
sending
his
wife
back
to
the
Eyrie,
and
his
son
to
be
fostered
on
Dragonstone…
he
meant
to
act…”

“So
you
poisoned
him
first.”

“No.”
Pycelle
struggled
feebly.
Shagga
growled
and
grabbed
his
head.
The
clansman’s
hand
was
so
big
he
could
have
crushed
the
maester’s
skull
like
an
eggshell
had
he
squeezed.

Tyrion
tsked
at
him.
“I
saw
the
tears
of
Lys
among
your
potions.
And
you
sent
away
Lord
Arryn’s
own
maester
and
tended
him
yourself,
so
you
could
make
certain
that
he
died.”

“A
falsehood!”

“Shave
him
closer,”
Tyrion
suggested.
“The
throat
again.”

The
axe
swept
back
down,
rasping
over
the
skin.
A
thin
film
of
spit
bubbled
on
Pycelle’s
lips
as
his
mouth
trembled.
“I
tried
to
save
Lord
Arryn.
I
vow—”

“Careful
now,
Shagga,
you’ve
cut
him.”

Shagga
growled.
“Dolf
fathered
warriors,
not
barbers.”

When
he
felt
the
blood
trickling
down
his
neck
and
onto
his
chest,
the
old
man
shuddered,
and
the
last
strength
went
out
of
him.
He
looked
shrunken,
both
smaller
and
frailer
than
he
had
been
when
they
burst
in
on
him.
“Yes,”
he
wimpered,
“yes,
Colemon
was
purging,
so
I
sent
him
away.
The
queen
needed
Lord
Arryn
dead,
she
did
not
say
so,
could
not,
Varys
was
listening,
always
listening,
but
when
I
looked
at
her
I
knew.
It
was
not
me
who
gave
him
the
poison,
though,
I
swear
it.”
The
old
man
wept.
“Varys
will
tell
you,
it
was
the
boy,
his
squire,
Hugh
he
was
called,
he
must
surely
have
done
it,
ask
your
sister,
ask
her.”

Tyrion
was
disgusted.
“Bind
him
and
take
him
away,”
he
commanded.
“Throw
him
down
in
one
of
the
black
cells.”

They
dragged
him
out
the
splintered
door.
“Lannister,”
he
moaned,
“all
I’ve
done
has
been
for
Lannister…”

When
he
was
gone,
Tyrion
made
a
leisurely
search
of
the
quarters
and
collected
a
few
more
small
jars
from
his
shelves.
The
ravens
muttered
above
his
head
as
he
worked,
a
strangely
peaceful
noise.
He
would
need
to
find
someone
to
tend
the
birds
until
the
Citadel
sent
a
man
to
replace
Pycelle.

He
was
the
one
I’d
hoped
to
trust.
Varys
and
Littlefinger
were
no
more
loyal,
he
suspected…
only
more
subtle,
and
thus
more
dangerous.
Perhaps
his
father’s
way
would
have
been
best:
summon
Ilyn
Payne,
mount
three
heads
above
the
gates,
and
have
done.
And
wouldn’t
that
be
a
pretty
sight,
he
thought.
=======
move,
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
poison
as
they
rode
away.
Soon
he
was
lost
in
the
tall
grass.
When
they
could
not
see
him
anymore,
Dany
grew
afraid.
“Will
he
find
his
way
back?”
she
asked
Ser
Jorah
as
they
rode.

“Even
a
man
as
blind
as
your
brother
should
be
able
to
follow
our
trail,”
he
replied.

“He
is
proud.
He
may
be
too
shamed
to
come
back.”

Jorah
laughed.
“Where
else
should
he
go?
If
he
cannot
find
the
khalasar,
the
khalasar
will
most
surely
find
him.
It
is
hard
to
drown
in
the
Dothraki
sea,
child.”

Dany
saw
the
truth
of
that.
The
khalasar
was
like
a
city
on
the
march,
but
it
did
not
march
blindly.
Always
scouts
ranged
far
ahead
of
the
main
column,
alert
for
any
sign
of
game
or
prey
or
enemies,
while
outriders
guarded
their
flanks.
They
missed
nothing,
not
here,
in
this
land,
the
place
where
they
had
come
from.
These
plains
were
a
part
of
them…
and
of
her,
now.

“I
hit
him,”
she
said,
wonder
in
her
voice.
Now
that
it
was
over,
it
seemed
like
some
strange
dream
that
she
had
dreamed.
“Ser
Jorah,
do
you
think…
he’ll
be
so
angry
when
he
gets
back…
She
shivered.
“I
woke
the
dragon,
didn’t
I?”

Ser
Jorah
snorted.
“Can
you
wake
the
dead,
girl?
Your
brother
Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,
and
he
died
on
the
Trident.
Viserys
is
less
than
the
shadow
of
a
snake.”

His
blunt
words
startled
her.
It
seemed
as
though
all
the
things
she
had
always
believed
were
suddenly
called
into
question.
“You…
you
swore
him
your
sword…”

“That
I
did,
girl,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“And
if
your
brother
is
the
shadow
of
a
snake,
what
does
that
make
his
servants?”
His
voice
was
bitter.

“He
is
still
the
true
king.
He
is…”

Jorah
pulled
up
his
horse
and
looked
at
her.
“Truth
now.
Would
you
want
to
see
Viserys
sit
a
throne?”

Dany
thought
about
that.
“He
would
not
be
a
very
good
king,
would
he?”

“There
have
been
worse…
but
not
many.”
The
knight
gave
his
heels
to
his
mount
and
started
off
again.

Dany
rode
close
beside
him.
“Still,”
she
said,
“the
common
people
are
waiting
for
him.
Magister
Illyrio
says
they
are
sewing
dragon
banners
and
praying
for
Viserys
to
return
from
across
the
narrow
sea
to
free
them.”

“The
common
people
pray
for
rain,
healthy
children,
and
a
summer
that
never
ends,”
Ser
Jorah
told
her.
“It
is
no
matter
to
them
if
the
high
lords
play
their
game
of
thrones,
so
long
as
they
are
left
in
peace.”
He
gave
a
shrug.
“They
never
are.”

Dany
rode
along
quietly
for
a
time,
working
his
words
like
a
puzzle
box.
It
went
against
everything
that
Viserys
had
ever
told
her
to
think
that
the
people
could
care
so
little
whether
a
true
king
or
a
usurper
reigned
over
them.
Yet
the
more
she
thought
on
Jorah’s
words,
the
more
they
rang
of
truth.

“What
do
you
pray
for,
Ser
Jorah?”
she
asked
him.

“Home,”
he
said.
His
voice
was
thick
with
longing.

“I
pray
for
home
too,”
she
told
him,
believing
it.

Ser
Jorah
laughed.
“Look
around
you
then,
Khaleesi.”

But
it
was
not
the
plains
Dany
saw
then.
It
was
King’s
Landing
and
the
great
Red
Keep
that
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
built.
It
was
Dragonstone
where
she
had
been
born.
In
her
mind’s
eye
they
burned
with
a
thousand
lights,
a
fire
blazing
in
every
window.
In
her
mind’s
eye,
all
the
doors
were
red.

“My
brother
will
never
take
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Dany
said.
She
had
known
that
for
a
long
time,
she
realized.
She
had
known
it
all
her
life.
Only
she
had
never
let
herself
say
the
words,
even
in
a
whisper,
but
now
she
said
them
for
Jorah
Mormont
and
all
the
world
to
hear.

Ser
Jorah
gave
her
a
measuring
look.
“You
think
not.”

“He
could
not
lead
an
army
even
if
my
lord
husband
gave
him
one,”
Dany
said.
“He
has
no
coin
and
the
only
knight
who
follows
him
reviles
him
as
less
than
a
snake.
The
Dothraki
make
mock
of
his
weakness.
He
will
never
take
us
home.”

“Wise
child.”
The
knight
smiled.

“I
am
no
child,”
she
told
him
fiercely.
Her
heels
pressed
into
the
sides
of
her
mount,
rousing
the
silver
to
a
gallop.
Faster
and
faster
she
raced,
leaving
Jorah
and
Irri
and
the
others
far
behind,
the
warm
wind
in
her
hair
and
the
setting
sun
red
on
her
face.
By
the
time
she
reached
the
khalasar,
it
was
dusk.

The
slaves
had
erected
her
tent
by
the
shore
of
a
spring-fed
pool.
She
could
hear
rough
voices
from
the
woven
grass
palace
on
the
hill.
Soon
there
would
be
laughter,
when
the
men
of
her
khas
told
the
story
of
what
had
happened
in
the
grasses
today.
By
the
time
Viserys
came
limping
back
among
them,
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
the
camp
would
know
him
for
a
walker.
There
were
no
secrets
in
the
khalasar.

Dany
gave
the
silver
over
to
the
slaves
for
grooming
and
entered
her
tent.
It
was
cool
and
dim
beneath
the
silk.
As
she
let
the
door
flap
close
behind
her,
Dany
saw
a
finger
of
dusty
red
light
reach
out
to
touch
her
dragon’s
eggs
across
the
tent.
For
an
instant
a
thousand
droplets
of
scarlet
flame
swam
before
her
eyes.
She
blinked,
and
they
were
gone.

Stone,
she
told
herself.
They
are
only
stone,
even
Illyrio
said
so,
the
dragons
are
all
dead.
She
put
her
palm
against
the
black
egg,
fingers
spread
gently
across
the
curve
of
the
shell.
The
stone
was
warm.
Almost
hot.
“The
sun,”
Dany
whispered.
“The
sun
warmed
them
as
they
rode.”

She
commanded
her
handmaids
to
prepare
her
a
bath.
Doreah
built
a
fire
outside
the
tent,
while
Irri
and
Jhiqui
fetched
the
big
copper
tub—another
bride
gift—from
the
packhorses
and
carried
water
from
the
pool.
When
the
bath
was
steaming,
Irri
helped
her
into
it
and
climbed
in
after
her.

“Have
you
ever
seen
a
dragon?”
she
asked
as
Irri
scrubbed
her
back
and
Jhiqui
sluiced
sand
from
her
hair.
She
had
heard
that
the
first
dragons
had
come
from
the
east,
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai
and
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea.
Perhaps
some
were
still
living
there,
in
realms
strange
and
wild.

“Dragons
are
gone,
Khaleesi,”
Irri
said.

“Dead,”
agreed
Jhiqui.
“Long
and
long
ago.”

Viserys
had
told
her
that
the
last
Targaryen
dragons
had
died
no
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
ago,
during
the
reign
of
Aegon
III,
who
was
called
the
Dragonbane.
That
did
not
seem
so
long
ago
to
Dany.
“Everywhere?”
she
said,
disappointed.
“Even
in
the
east?”
Magic
had
died
in
the
west
when
the
Doom
fell
on
Valyria
and
the
Lands
of
the
Long
Summer,
and
neither
spell-forged
steel
nor
stormsingers
nor
dragons
could
hold
it
back,
but
Dany
had
always
heard
that
the
east
was
different.
It
was
said
that
manticores
prowled
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
that
basilisks
infested
the
jungles
of
Yi
Ti,
that
spellsingers,
warlocks,
and
aeromancers
practiced
their
arts
openly
in
Asshai,
while
shadowbinders
and
bloodmages
worked
terrible
sorceries
in
the
black
of
night.
Why
shouldn’t
there
be
dragons
too?

“No
dragon,”
Irri
said.
“Brave
men
kill
them,
for
dragon
terrible
evil
beasts.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
agreed
Jhiqui.

“A
trader
from
Qarth
once
told
me
that
dragons
came
from
the
moon,”
blond
Doreah
said
as
she
warmed
a
towel
over
the
fire.
Jhiqui
and
Irri
were
of
an
age
with
Dany,
Dothraki
girls
taken
as
slaves
when
Drogo
destroyed
their
father’s
khalasar.
Doreah
was
older,
almost
twenty.
Magister
Illyrio
had
found
her
in
a
pleasure
house
in
Lys.

Silvery-wet
hair
tumbled
across
her
eyes
as
Dany
turned
her
head,
curious.
“The
moon?”

“He
told
me
the
moon
was
an
egg,
Khaleesi,”
the
Lysene
girl
said.
“Once
there
were
two
moons
in
the
sky,
but
one
wandered
too
close
to
the
sun
and
cracked
from
the
heat.
A
thousand
thousand
dragons
poured
forth,
and
drank
the
fire
of
the
sun.
That
is
why
dragons
breathe
flame.
One
day
the
other
moon
will
kiss
the
sun
too,
and
then
it
will
crack
and
the
dragons
will
return.”

The
two
Dothraki
girls
giggled
and
laughed.
“You
are
foolish
strawhead
slave,”
Irri
said.
“Moon
is
no
egg.
Moon
is
god,
woman
wife
of
sun.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
Jhiqui
agreed.

Dany’s
skin
was
flushed
and
pink
when
she
climbed
from
the
tub.
Jhiqui
laid
her
down
to
oil
her
body
and
scrape
the
dirt
from
her
pores.
Afterward
Irri
sprinkled
her
with
spiceflower
and
cinnamon.
While
Doreah
brushed
her
hair
until
it
shone
like
spun
silver,
she
thought
about
the
moon,
and
eggs,
and
dragons.

Her
supper
was
a
simple
meal
of
fruit
and
cheese
and
fry
bread,
with
a
jug
of
honeyed
wine
to
wash
it
down.
“Doreah,
stay
and
eat
with
me,”
Dany
commanded
when
she
sent
her
other
handmaids
away.
The
Lysene
girl
had
hair
the
color
of
honey,
and
eyes
like
the
summer
sky.

She
lowered
those
eyes
when
they
were
alone.
“You
honor
me,
Khaleesi,”
she
said,
but
it
was
no
honor,
only
service.
Long
after
the
moon
had
risen,
they
sat
together,
talking.

That
night,
when
Khal
Drogo
came,
Dany
was
waiting
for
him.
He
stood
in
the
door
of
her
tent
and
looked
at
her
with
surprise.
She
rose
slowly
and
opened
her
sleeping
silks
and
let
them
fall
to
the
ground.
“This
night
we
must
go
outside,
my
lord,”
she
told
him,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.

Khal
Drogo
followed
her
out
into
the
moonlight,
the
bells
in
his
hair
tinkling
softly.
A
few
yards
from
her
tent
was
a
bed
of
soft
grass,
and
it
was
there
that
Dany
drew
him
down.
When
he
tried
to
turn
her
over,
she
put
a
hand
on
his
chest.
“No,”
she
said.
“This
night
I
would
look
on
your
face.”

There
is
no
privacy
in
the
heart
of
the
khalasar.
Dany
felt
the
eyes
on
her
as
she
undressed
him,
heard
the
soft
voices
as
she
did
the
things
that
Doreah
had
told
her
to
do.
It
was
nothing
to
her.
Was
she
not
khaleesi?
His
were
the
only
eyes
that
mattered,
and
when
she
mounted
him
she
saw
something
there
that
she
had
never
seen
before.
She
rode
him
as
fiercely
as
ever
she
had
ridden
her
silver,
and
when
the
moment
of
his
pleasure
came,
Khal
Drogo
called
out
her
name.

They
were
on
the
far
side
of
the
Dothraki
sea
when
Jhiqui
brushed
the
soft
swell
of
Dany’s
stomach
with
her
fingers
and
said,
“Khaleesi,
you
are
with
child.”

“I
know,”
Dany
told
her.

It
was
her
fourteenth
name
day.





BRAN

In
the
yard
below,
Rickon
ran
with
the
wolves.

Bran
watched
from
his
window
seat.
Wherever
the
boy
went,
Grey
Wind
was
there
first,
loping
ahead
to
cut
him
off,
until
Rickon
saw
him,
screamed
in
delight,
and
went
pelting
off
in
another
direction.
Shaggydog
ran
at
his
heels,
spinning
and
snapping
if
the
other
wolves
came
too
close.
His
fur
had
darkened
until
he
was
all
black,
and
his
eyes
were
green
fire.
Bran’s
Summer
came
last.
He
was
silver
and
smoke,
with
eyes
of
yellow
gold
that
saw
all
there
was
to
see.
Smaller
than
Grey
Wind,
and
more
wary.
Bran
thought
he
was
the
smartest
of
the
litter.
He
could
hear
his
brother’s
breathless
laughter
as
Rickon
dashed
across
the
hard-packed
earth
on
little
baby
legs.

His
eyes
stung.
He
wanted
to
be
down
there,
laughing
and
running.
Angry
at
the
thought,
Bran
knuckled
away
the
tears
before
they
could
fall.
His
eighth
name
day
had
come
and
gone.
He
was
almost
a
man
grown
now,
too
old
to
cry.

“It
was
just
a
lie,”
he
said
bitterly,
remembering
the
crow
from
his
dream.
“I
can’t
fly.
I
can’t
even
run.”

“Crows
are
all
liars,”
Old
Nan
agreed,
from
the
chair
where
she
sat
doing
her
needlework.
“I
know
a
story
about
a
crow.”

“I
don’t
want
any
more
stories,”
Bran
snapped,
his
voice
petulant.
He
had
liked
Old
Nan
and
her
stories
once.
Before.
But
it
was
different
now.
They
left
her
with
him
all
day
now,
to
watch
over
him
and
clean
him
and
keep
him
from
being
lonely,
but
she
just
made
it
worse.
“I
hate
your
stupid
stories.”

The
old
woman
smiled
at
him
toothlessly.
“My
stories?
No,
my
little
lord,
not
mine.
The
stories
are,
before
me
and
after
me,
before
you
too.”

She
was
a
very
ugly
old
woman,
Bran
thought
spitefully;
shrunken
and
wrinkled,
almost
blind,
too
weak
to
climb
stairs,
with
only
a
few
wisps
of
white
hair
left
to
cover
a
mottled
pink
scalp.
No
one
really
knew
how
old
she
was,
but
his
father
said
she’d
been
called
Old
Nan
even
when
he
was
a
boy.
She
was
the
oldest
person
in
Winterfell
for
certain,
maybe
the
oldest
person
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Nan
had
come
to
the
castle
as
a
wet
nurse
for
a
Brandon
Stark
whose
mother
had
died
birthing
him.
He
had
been
an
older
brother
of
Lord
Rickard,
Bran’s
grandfather,
or
perhaps
a
younger
brother,
or
a
brother
to
Lord
Rickard’s
father.
Sometimes
Old
Nan
told
it
one
way
and
sometimes
another.
In
all
the
stories
the
little
boy
died
at
three
of
a
summer
chill,
but
Old
Nan
stayed
on
at
Winterfell
with
her
own
children.
She
had
lost
both
her
sons
to
the
war
when
King
Robert
won
the
throne,
and
her
grandson
was
killed
on
the
walls
of
Pyke
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion.
Her
daughters
had
long
ago
married
and
moved
away
and
died.
All
that
was
left
of
her
own
blood
was
Hodor,
the
simpleminded
giant
who
worked
in
the
stables,
but
Old
Nan
just
lived
on
and
on,
doing
her
needlework
and
telling
her
stories.

“I
don’t
care
whose
stories
they
are,”
Bran
told
her,
“I
hate
them.”
He
didn’t
want
stories
and
he
didn’t
want
Old
Nan.
He
wanted
his
mother
and
father.
He
wanted
to
go
running
with
Summer
loping
beside
him.
He
wanted
to
climb
the
broken
tower
and
feed
corn
to
the
crows.
He
wanted
to
ride
his
pony
again
with
his
brothers.
He
wanted
it
to
be
the
way
it
had
been
before.

“I
know
a
story
about
a
boy
who
hated
stories,”
Old
Nan
said
with
her
stupid
little
smile,
her
needles
moving
all
the
while,
click
click
click,
until
Bran
was
ready
to
scream
at
her.

It
would
never
be
the
way
it
had
been,
he
knew.
The
crow
had
tricked
him
into
flying,
but
when
he
woke
up
he
was
broken
and
the
world
was
changed.
They
had
all
left
him,
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
sisters
and
even
his
bastard
brother
Jon.
His
father
had
promised
he
would
ride
a
real
horse
to
King’s
Landing,
but
they’d
gone
without
him.
Maester
Luwin
had
sent
a
bird
after
Lord
Eddard
with
a
message,
and
another
to
Mother
and
a
third
to
Jon
on
the
Wall,
but
there
had
been
no
answers.
“Ofttimes
the
birds
are
lost,
child,”
the
maester
had
told
him.
“There’s
many
a
mile
and
many
a
hawk
between
here
and
King’s
Landing,
the
message
may
not
have
reached
them.”
Yet
to
Bran
it
felt
as
if
they
had
all
died
while
he
had
slept…
or
perhaps
Bran
had
died,
and
they
had
forgotten
him.
Jory
and
Ser
Rodrik
and
Vayon
Poole
had
gone
too,
and
Hullen
and
Harwin
and
Fat
Tom
and
a
quarter
of
the
guard.

Only
Robb
and
baby
Rickon
were
still
here,
and
Robb
was
changed.
He
was
Robb
the
Lord
now,
or
trying
to
be.
He
wore
a
real
sword
and
never
smiled.
His
days
were
spent
drilling
the
guard
and
practicing
his
swordplay,
making
the
yard
ring
with
the
sound
of
steel
as
Bran
watched
forlornly
from
his
window.
At
night
he
closeted
himself
with
Maester
Luwin,
talking
or
going
over
account
books.
Sometimes
he
would
ride
out
with
Hallis
Mollen
and
be
gone
for
days
at
a
time,
visiting
distant
holdfasts.
Whenever
he
was
away
more
than
a
day,
Rickon
would
cry
and
ask
Bran
if
Robb
was
ever
coming
back.
Even
when
he
was
home
at
Winterfell,
Robb
the
Lord
seemed
to
have
more
time
for
Hallis
Mollen
and
Theon
Greyjoy
than
he
ever
did
for
his
brothers.

“I
could
tell
you
the
story
about
Brandon
the
Builder,”
Old
Nan
said.
“That
was
always
your
favorite.”

Thousands
and
thousands
of
years
ago,
Brandon
the
Builder
had
raised
Winterfell,
and
some
said
the
Wall.
Bran
knew
the
story,
but
it
had
never
been
his
favorite.
Maybe
one
of
the
other
Brandons
had
liked
that
story.
Sometimes
Nan
would
talk
to
him
as
if
he
were
her
Brandon,
the
baby
she
had
nursed
all
those
years
ago,
and
sometimes
she
confused
him
with
his
uncle
Brandon,
who
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
before
Bran
was
even
born.
She
had
lived
so
long,
Mother
had
told
him
once,
that
all
the
Brandon
Starks
had
become
one
person
in
her
head.

“That’s
not
my
favorite,”
he
said.
“My
favorites
were
the
scary
ones.”
He
heard
some
sort
of
commotion
outside
and
turned
back
to
the
window.
Rickon
was
running
across
the
yard
toward
the
gatehouse,
the
wolves
following
him,
but
the
tower
faced
the
wrong
way
for
Bran
to
see
what
was
happening.
He
smashed
a
fist
on
his
thigh
in
frustration
and
felt
nothing.

“Oh,
my
sweet
summer
child,”
Old
Nan
said
quietly,
“what
do
you
know
of
fear?
Fear
is
for
the
winter,
my
little
lord,
when
the
snows
fall
a
hundred
feet
deep
and
the
ice
wind
comes
howling
out
of
the
north.
Fear
is
for
the
long
night,
when
the
sun
hides
its
face
for
years
at
a
time,
and
little
children
are
born
and
live
and
die
all
in
darkness
while
the
direwolves
grow
gaunt
and
hungry,
and
the
white
walkers
move
through
the
woods.”

“You
mean
the
Others,”
Bran
said
querulously.

“The
Others,”
Old
Nan
agreed.
“Thousands
and
thousands
of
years
ago,
a
winter
fell
that
was
cold
and
hard
and
endless
beyond
all
memory
of
man.
There
came
a
night
that
lasted
a
generation,
and
kings
shivered
and
died
in
their
castles
even
as
the
swineherds
in
their
hovels.
Women
smothered
their
children
rather
than
see
them
starve,
and
cried,
and
felt
their
tears
freeze
on
their
cheeks.”
Her
voice
and
her
needles
fell
silent,
and
she
glanced
up
at
Bran
with
pale,
filmy
eyes
and
asked,
“So,
child.
This
is
the
sort
of
story
you
like?”

“Well,”
Bran
said
reluctantly,
“yes,
only…”

Old
Nan
nodded.
“In
that
darkness,
the
Others
came
for
the
first
time,”
she
said
as
her
needles
went
click
click
click.
“They
were
cold
things,
dead
things,
that
hated
iron
and
fire
and
the
touch
of
the
sun,
and
every
creature
with
hot
blood
in
its
veins.
They
swept
over
holdfasts
and
cities
and
kingdoms,
felled
heroes
and
armies
by
the
score,
riding
their
pale
dead
horses
and
leading
hosts
of
the
slain.
All
the
swords
of
men
could
not
stay
their
advance,
and
even
maidens
and
suckling
babes
found
no
pity
in
them.
They
hunted
the
maids
through
frozen
forests,
and
fed
their
dead
servants
on
the
flesh
of
human
children.”

Her
voice
had
dropped
very
low,
almost
to
a
whisper,
and
Bran
found
himself
leaning
forward
to
listen.

“Now
these
were
the
days
before
the
Andals
came,
and
long
before
the
women
fled
across
the
narrow
sea
from
the
cities
of
the
Rhoyne,
and
the
hundred
kingdoms
of
those
times
were
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men,
who
had
taken
these
lands
from
the
children
of
the
forest.
Yet
here
and
there
in
the
fastness
of
the
woods
the
children
still
lived
in
their
wooden
cities
and
hollow
hills,
and
the
faces
in
the
trees
kept
watch.
So
as
cold
and
death
filled
the
earth,
the
last
hero
determined
to
seek
out
the
children,
in
the
hopes
that
their
ancient
magics
could
win
back
what
the
armies
of
men
had
lost.
He
set
out
into
the
dead
lands
with
a
sword,
a
horse,
a
dog,
and
a
dozen
companions.
For
years
he
searched,
until
he
despaired
of
ever
finding
the
children
of
the
forest
in
their
secret
cities.
One
by
one
his
friends
died,
and
his
horse,
and
finally
even
his
dog,
and
his
sword
froze
so
hard
the
blade
snapped
when
he
tried
to
use
it.
And
the
Others
smelled
the
hot
blood
in
him,
and
came
silent
on
his
trail,
stalking
him
with
packs
of
pale
white
spiders
big
as
hounds—”

The
door
opened
with
a
bang,
and
Bran’s
heart
leapt
up
into
his
mouth
in
sudden
fear,
but
it
was
only
Maester
Luwin,
with
Hodor
looming
in
the
stairway
behind
him.
“Hodor!”
the
stableboy
announced,
as
was
his
custom,
smiling
hugely
at
them
all.

Maester
Luwin
was
not
smiling.
“We
have
visitors,”
he
announced,
“and
your
presence
is
required,
Bran.”

“I’m
listening
to
a
story
now,”
Bran
complained.

“Stories
wait,
my
little
lord,
and
when
you
come
back
to
them,
why,
there
they
are,”
Old
Nan
said.
“Visitors
are
not
so
patient,
and
ofttimes
they
bring
stories
of
their
own.”

“Who
is
it?”
Bran
asked
Maester
Luwin.

“Tyrion
Lannister,
and
some
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
with
word
from
your
brother
Jon.
Robb
is
meeting
with
them
now.
Hodor,
will
you
help
Bran
down
to
the
hall?”

“Hodor!”
Hodor
agreed
happily.
He
ducked
to
get
his
great
shaggy
head
under
the
door.
Hodor
was
nearly
seven
feet
tall.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
he
was
the
same
blood
as
Old
Nan.
Bran
wondered
if
he
would
shrivel
up
as
small
as
his
great-grandmother
when
he
was
old.
It
did
not
seem
likely,
even
if
Hodor
lived
to
be
a
thousand.

Hodor
lifted
Bran
as
easy
as
if
he
were
a
bale
of
hay,
and
cradled
him
against
his
massive
chest.
He
always
smelled
faintly
of
horses,
but
it
was
not
a
bad
smell.
His
arms
were
thick
with
muscle
and
matted
with
brown
hair.
“Hodor,”
he
said
again.
Theon
Greyjoy
had
once
commented
that
Hodor
did
not
know
much,
but
no
one
could
doubt
that
he
knew
his
name.
Old
Nan
had
cackled
like
a
hen
when
Bran
told
her
that,
and
confessed
that
Hodor’s
real
name
was
Walder.
No
one
knew
where
“Hodor”
had
come
from,
she
said,
but
when
he
started
saying
it,
they
started
calling
him
by
it.
It
was
the
only
word
he
had.

They
left
Old
Nan
in
the
tower
room
with
her
needles
and
her
memories.
Hodor
hummed
tunelessly
as
he
carried
Bran
down
the
steps
and
through
the
gallery,
with
Maester
Luwin
following
behind,
hurrying
to
keep
up
with
the
stableboy’s
long
strides.

Robb
was
seated
in
Father’s
high
seat,
wearing
ringmail
and
boiled
leather
and
the
stern
face
of
Robb
the
Lord.
Theon
Greyjoy
and
Hallis
Mollen
stood
behind
him.
A
dozen
guardsmen
lined
the
grey
stone
walls
beneath
tall
narrow
windows.
In
the
center
of
the
room
the
dwarf
stood
with
his
servants,
and
four
strangers
in
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Bran
could
sense
the
anger
in
the
hall
the
moment
that
Hodor
carried
him
through
the
doors.

“Any
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
is
welcome
here
at
Winterfell
for
as
long
as
he
wishes
to
stay,”
Robb
was
saying
with
the
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord.
His
sword
was
across
his
knees,
the
steel
bare
for
all
the
world
to
see.
Even
Bran
knew
what
it
meant
to
greet
a
guest
with
an
unsheathed
sword.

“Any
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch,”
the
dwarf
repeated,
“but
not
me,
do
I
take
your
meaning,
boy?”

Robb
stood
and
pointed
at
the
little
man
with
his
sword.
“I
am
the
lord
here
while
my
mother
and
father
are
away,
Lannister.
I
am
not
your
boy.”

“If
you
are
a
lord,
you
might
learn
a
lord’s
courtesy,”
the
little
man
replied,
ignoring
the
sword
point
in
his
face.
“Your
bastard
brother
has
all
your
father’s
graces,
it
would
seem.”

“Jon,”
Bran
gasped
out
from
Hodor’s
arms.

The
dwarf
turned
to
look
at
him.
“So
it
is
true,
the
boy
lives.
I
could
scarce
believe
it.
You
Starks
are
hard
to
kill.”

“You
Lannisters
had
best
remember
that,”
Robb
said,
lowering
his
sword.
“Hodor,
bring
my
brother
here.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
said,
and
he
trotted
forward
smiling
and
set
Bran
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks,
where
the
Lords
of
Winterfell
had
sat
since
the
days
when
they
called
themselves
the
Kings
in
the
North.
The
seat
was
cold
stone,
polished
smooth
by
countless
bottoms;
the
carved
heads
of
direwolves
snarled
on
the
ends
of
its
massive
arms.
Bran
clasped
them
as
he
sat,
his
useless
legs
dangling.
The
great
seat
made
him
feel
half
a
baby.

Robb
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder.
“You
said
you
had
business
with
Bran.
Well,
here
he
is,
Lannister.”

Bran
was
uncomfortably
aware
of
Tyrion
Lannister’s
eyes.
One
was
black
and
one
was
green,
and
both
were
looking
at
him,
studying
him,
weighing
him.
“I
am
told
you
were
quite
the
climber,
Bran,”
the
little
man
said
at
last.
“Tell
me,
how
is
it
you
happened
to
fall
that
day?”

“I
never,”
Bran
insisted.
He
never
fell,
never
never
never.

“The
child
does
not
remember
anything
of
the
fall,
or
the
climb
that
came
before
it,”
said
Maester
Luwin
gently.

“Curious,”
said
Tyrion
Lannister.

“My
brother
is
not
here
to
answer
questions,
Lannister,”
Robb
said
curtly.
“Do
your
business
and
be
on
your
way.”

“I
have
a
gift
for
you,”
the
dwarf
said
to
Bran.
“Do
you
like
to
ride,
boy?”

Maester
Luwin
came
forward.
“My
lord,
the
child
has
lost
the
use
of
his
legs.
He
cannot
sit
a
horse.”

“Nonsense,”
said
Lannister.
“With
the
right
horse
and
the
right
saddle,
even
a
cripple
can
ride.”

The
word
was
a
knife
through
Bran’s
heart.
He
felt
tears
come
unbidden
to
his
eyes.
“I’m
not
a
cripple!”

“Then
I
am
not
a
dwarf,”
the
dwarf
said
with
a
twist
of
his
mouth.
“My
father
will
rejoice
to
hear
it.”
Greyjoy
laughed.

“What
sort
of
horse
and
saddle
are
you
suggesting?”
Maester
Luwin
asked.

“A
smart
horse,”
Lannister
replied.
“The
boy
cannot
use
his
legs
to
command
the
animal,
so
you
must
shape
the
horse
to
the
rider,
teach
it
to
respond
to
the
reins,
to
the
voice.
I
would
begin
with
an
unbroken
yearling,
with
no
old
training
to
be
unlearned.”
He
drew
a
rolled
paper
from
his
belt.
“Give
this
to
your
saddler.
He
will
provide
the
rest.”

Maester
Luwin
took
the
paper
from
the
dwarfs
hand,
curious
as
a
small
grey
squirrel.
He
unrolled
it,
studied
it.
“I
see.
You
draw
nicely,
my
lord.
Yes,
this
ought
to
work.
I
should
have
thought
of
this
myself.”

“It
came
easier
to
me,
Maester.
It
is
not
terribly
unlike
my
own
saddles.”

“Will
I
truly
be
able
to
ride?”
Bran
asked.
He
wanted
to
believe
them,
but
he
was
afraid.
Perhaps
it
was
just
another
lie.
The
crow
had
promised
him
that
he
could
fly.

“You
will,”
the
dwarf
told
him.
“And
I
swear
to
you,
boy,
on
horseback
you
will
be
as
tall
as
any
of
them.”

Robb
Stark
seemed
puzzled.
“Is
this
some
trap,
Lannister?
What’s
Bran
to
you?
Why
should
you
want
to
help
him?”

“Your
brother
Jon
asked
it
of
me.
And
I
have
a
tender
spot
in
my
heart
for
cripples
and
bastards
and
broken
things.”
Tyrion
Lannister
placed
a
hand
over
his
heart
and
grinned.

The
door
to
the
yard
flew
open.
Sunlight
came
streaming
across
the
hall
as
Rickon
burst
in,
breathless.
The
direwolves
were
with
him.
The
boy
stopped
by
the
door,
wide-eyed,
but
the
wolves
came
on.
Their
eyes
found
Lannister,
or
perhaps
they
caught
his
scent.
Summer
began
to
growl
first.
Grey
Wind
picked
it
up.
They
padded
toward
the
little
man,
one
from
the
right
and
one
from
the
left.

“The
wolves
do
not
like
your
smell,
Lannister,”
Theon
Greyioy
commented.

“Perhaps
it’s
time
I
took
my
leave,”
Tyrion
said.
He
took
a
step
backward…
and
Shaggydog
came
out
of
the
shadows
behind
him,
snarling.
Lannister
recoiled,
and
Summer
lunged
at
him
from
the
other
side.
He
reeled
away,
unsteady
on
his
feet,
and
Grey
Wind
snapped
at
his
arm,
teeth
ripping
at
his
sleeve
and
tearing
loose
a
scrap
of
cloth.

“No!”
Bran
shouted
from
the
high
seat
as
Lannister’s
men
reached
for
their
steel.
“Summer,
here.
Summer,
to
me!”

The
direwolf
heard
the
voice,
glanced
at
Bran,
and
again
at
Lannister.
He
crept
backward,
away
from
the
little
man,
and
settled
down
below
Bran’s
dangling
feet.

Robb
had
been
holding
his
breath.
He
let
it
out
with
a
sigh
and
called,
“Grey
Wind.”
His
direwolf
moved
to
him,
swift
and
silent.
Now
there
was
only
Shaggydog,
rumbling
at
the
small
man,
his
eyes
burning
like
green
fire.

“Rickon,
call
him,”
Bran
shouted
to
his
baby
brother,
and
Rickon
remembered
himself
and
screamed,
“Home,
Shaggy,
home
now.”
The
black
wolf
gave
Lannister
one
final
snarl
and
bounded
off
to
Rickon,
who
hugged
him
tightly
around
the
neck.

Tyrion
Lannister
undid
his
scarf,
mopped
at
his
brow,
and
said
in
a
flat
voice,
“How
interesting.”

“Are
you
well,
my
lord?”
asked
one
of
his
men,
his
sword
in
hand.
He
glanced
nervously
at
the
direwolves
as
he
spoke.

“My
sleeve
is
torn
and
my
breeches
are
unaccountably
damp,
but
nothing
was
harmed
save
my
dignity.”

Even
Robb
looked
shaken.
“The
wolves…
I
don’t
know
why
they
did
that…”

“No
doubt
they
mistook
me
for
dinner.”
Lannister
bowed
stiffly
to
Bran.
“I
thank
you
for
calling
them
off,
young
ser.
I
promise
you,
they
would
have
found
me
quite
indigestible.
And
now
I
will
be
leaving,
truly.”

“A
moment,
my
lord,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
He
moved
to
Robb
and
they
huddled
close
together,
whispering.
Bran
tried
to
hear
what
they
were
saying,
but
their
voices
were
too
low.

Robb
Stark
finally
sheathed
his
sword.
“I…
I
may
have
been
hasty
with
you,”
he
said.
“You’ve
done
Bran
a
kindness,
and,
well…”
Robb
composed
himself
with
an
effort.
“The
hospitality
of
Winterfell
is
yours
if
you
wish
it,
Lannister.”

“Spare
me
your
false
courtesies,
boy.
You
do
not
love
me
and
you
do
not
want
me
here.
I
saw
an
inn
outside
your
walls,
in
the
winter
town.
I’ll
find
a
bed
there,
and
both
of
us
will
sleep
easier.
For
a
few
coppers
I
may
even
find
a
comely
wench
to
warm
the
sheets
for
me.”
He
spoke
to
one
of
the
black
brothers,
an
old
man
with
a
twisted
back
and
a
tangled
beard.
“Yoren,
we
go
south
at
daybreak.
You
will
find
me
on
the
road,
no
doubt.”
With
that
he
made
his
exit,
struggling
across
the
hall
on
his
short
legs,
past
Rickon
and
out
the
door.
His
men
followed.

The
four
of
the
Night’s
Watch
remained.
Robb
turned
to
them
uncertainly.
“I
have
had
rooms
prepared,
and
you’ll
find
no
lack
of
hot
water
to
wash
off
the
dust
of
the
road.
I
hope
you
will
honor
us
at
table
tonight.”
He
spoke
the
words
so
awkwardly
that
even
Bran
took
note;
it
was
a
speech
he
had
learned,
not
words
from
the
heart,
but
the
black
brothers
thanked
him
all
the
same.

Summer
followed
them
up
the
tower
steps
as
Hodor
carried
Bran
back
to
his
bed.
Old
Nan
was
asleep
in
her
chair.
Hodor
said
“Hodor,”
gathered
up
his
great-grandmother,
and
carried
her
off,
snoring
softly,
while
Bran
lay
thinking.
Robb
had
promised
that
he
could
feast
with
the
Night’s
Watch
in
the
Great
Hall.
“Summer,”
he
called.
The
wolf
bounded
up
on
the
bed.
Bran
hugged
him
so
hard
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
his
cheek.
“I
can
ride
now,”
he
whispered
to
his
friend.
“We
can
go
hunting
in
the
woods
soon,
wait
and
see.”
After
a
time
he
slept.

In
his
dream
he
was
climbing
again,
pulling
himself
up
an
ancient
windowless
tower,
his
fingers
forcing
themselves
between
blackened
stones,
his
feet
scrabbling
for
purchase.
Higher
and
higher
he
climbed,
through
the
clouds
and
into
the
night
sky,
and
still
the
tower
rose
before
him.
When
he
paused
to
look
down,
his
head
swam
dizzily
and
he
felt
his
fingers
slipping.
Bran
cried
out
and
clung
for
dear
life.
The
earth
was
a
thousand
miles
beneath
him
and
he
could
not
fly.
He
could
not
fly.
He
waited
until
his
heart
had
stopped
pounding,
until
he
could
breathe,
and
he
began
to
climb
again.
There
was
no
way
to
go
but
up.
Far
above
him,
outlined
against
a
vast
pale
moon,
he
thought
he
could
see
the
shapes
of
gargoyles.
His
arms
were
sore
and
aching,
but
he
dared
not
rest.
He
forced
himself
to
climb
faster.
The
gargoyles
watched
him
ascend.
Their
eyes
glowed
red
as
hot
coals
in
a
brazier.
Perhaps
once
they
had
been
lions,
but
now
they
were
twisted
and
grotesque.
Bran
could
hear
them
whispering
to
each
other
in
soft
stone
voices
terrible
to
hear.
He
must
not
listen,
he
told
himself,
he
must
not
hear,
so
long
as
he
did
not
hear
them
he
was
safe.
But
when
the
gargoyles
pulled
themselves
loose
from
the
stone
and
padded
down
the
side
of
the
tower
to
where
Bran
clung,
he
knew
he
was
not
safe
after
all.
“I
didn’t
hear,”
he
wept
as
they
came
closer
and
closer,
“I
didn’t,
I
didn’t.”

He
woke
gasping,
lost
in
darkness,
and
saw
a
vast
shadow
looming
over
him.
“I
didn’t
hear,”
he
whispered,
trembling
in
fear,
but
then
the
shadow
said
“Hodor,”
and
lit
the
candle
by
the
bedside,
and
Bran
sighed
with
relief.

Hodor
washed
the
sweat
from
him
with
a
warm,
damp
cloth
and
dressed
him
with
deft
and
gentle
hands.
When
it
was
time,
he
carried
him
down
to
the
Great
Hall,
where
a
long
trestle
table
had
been
set
up
near
the
fire.
The
lord’s
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
been
left
empty,
but
Robb
sat
to
the
right
of
it,
with
Bran
across
from
him.
They
ate
suckling
pig
that
night,
and
pigeon
pie,
and
turnips
soaking
in
butter,
and
afterward
the
cook
had
promised
honeycombs.
Summer
snatched
table
scraps
from
Bran’s
hand,
while
Grey
Wind
and
Shaggydog
fought
over
a
bone
in
the
corner.
Winterfell’s
dogs
would
not
come
near
the
hall
now.
Bran
had
found
that
strange
at
first,
but
he
was
growing
used
to
it.

Yoren
was
senior
among
the
black
brothers,
so
the
steward
had
seated
him
between
Robb
and
Maester
Luwin.
The
old
man
had
a
sour
smell,
as
if
he
had
not
washed
in
a
long
time.
He
ripped
at
the
meat
with
his
teeth,
cracked
the
ribs
to
suck
out
the
marrow
from
the
bones,
and
shrugged
at
the
mention
of
Jon
Snow.
“Ser
Alliser’s
bane,”
he
grunted,
and
two
of
his
companions
shared
a
laugh
that
Bran
did
not
understand.
But
when
Robb
asked
for
news
of
their
uncle
Benjen,
the
black
brothers
grew
ominously
quiet.

“What
is
it?”
Bran
asked.

Yoren
wiped
his
fingers
on
his
vest.
“There’s
hard
news,
m’lords,
and
a
cruel
way
to
pay
you
for
your
meat
and
mead,
but
the
man
as
asks
the
question
must
bear
the
answer.
Stark’s
gone.”

One
of
the
other
men
said,
“The
Old
Bear
sent
him
out
to
look
for
Waymar
Royce,
and
he’s
late
returning,
my
lord.”

“Too
long,”
Yoren
said.
“Most
like
he’s
dead.”

“My
uncle
is
not
dead,”
Robb
Stark
said
loudly,
anger
in
his
tones.
He
rose
from
the
bench
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
“Do
you
hear
me?
My
uncle
is
not
dead!”
His
voice
rang
against
the
stone
walls,
and
Bran
was
suddenly
afraid.

Old
sour-smelling
Yoren
looked
up
at
Robb,
unimpressed.
“Whatever
you
say,
m’lord,”
he
said.
He
sucked
at
a
piece
of
meat
between
his
teeth.

The
youngest
of
the
black
brothers
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
seat.
“There’s
not
a
man
on
the
Wall
knows
the
haunted
forest
better
than
Benjen
Stark.
He’ll
find
his
way
back.”

“Well,”
said
Yoren,
“maybe
he
will
and
maybe
he
won’t.
Good
men
have
gone
into
those
woods
before,
and
never
come
out.”

All
Bran
could
think
of
was
Old
Nan’s
story
of
the
Others
and
the
last
hero,
hounded
through
the
white
woods
by
dead
men
and
spiders
big
as
hounds.
He
was
afraid
for
a
moment,
until
he
remembered
how
that
story
ended.
“The
children
will
help
him,”
he
blurted,
“the
children
of
the
forest!”

Theon
Greyjoy
sniggered,
and
Maester
Luwin
said,
“Bran,
the
children
of
the
forest
have
been
dead
and
gone
for
thousands
of
years.
All
that
is
left
of
them
are
the
faces
in
the
trees.”

“Down
here,
might
be
that’s
true,
Maester,”
Yoren
said,
“but
up
past
the
Wall,
who’s
to
say?
Up
there,
a
man
can’t
always
tell
what’s
alive
and
what’s
dead.”

That
night,
after
the
plates
had
been
cleared,
Robb
carried
Bran
up
to
bed
himself.
Grey
Wind
led
the
way,
and
Summer
came
close
behind.
His
brother
was
strong
for
his
age,
and
Bran
was
as
light
as
a
bundle
of
rags,
but
the
stairs
were
steep
and
dark,
and
Robb
was
breathing
hard
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top.

He
put
Bran
into
bed,
covered
him
with
blankets,
and
blew
out
the
candle.
For
a
time
Robb
sat
beside
him
in
the
dark.
Bran
wanted
to
talk
to
him,
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
say.
“We’ll
find
a
horse
for
you,
I
promise,”
Robb
whispered
at
last.

“Are
they
ever
coming
back?”
Bran
asked
him.

“Yes,”
Robb
said
with
such
hope
in
his
voice
that
Bran
knew
he
was
hearing
his
brother
and
not
just
Robb
the
Lord.
“Mother
will
be
home
soon.
Maybe
we
can
ride
out
to
meet
her
when
she
comes.
Wouldn’t
that
surprise
her,
to
see
you
ahorse?”
Even
in
the
dark
room,
Bran
could
feel
his
brother’s
smile.
“And
afterward,
we’ll
ride
north
to
see
the
Wall.
We
won’t
even
tell
Jon
we’re
coming,
we’ll
just
be
there
one
day,
you
and
me.
It
will
be
an
adventure.”

“An
adventure,”
Bran
repeated
wistfully.
He
heard
his
brother
sob.
The
room
was
so
dark
he
could
not
see
the
tears
on
Robb’s
face,
so
he
reached
out
and
found
his
hand.
Their
fingers
twined
together.





EDDARD

“Lord
Arryn’s
death
was
a
great
sadness
for
all
of
us,
my
lord,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“I
would
be
more
than
happy
to
tell
you
what
I
can
of
the
manner
of
his
passing.
Do
be
seated.
Would
you
care
for
refreshments?
Some
dates,
perhaps?
I
have
some
very
fine
persimmons
as
well.
Wine
no
longer
agrees
with
my
digestion,
I
fear,
but
I
can
offer
you
a
cup
of
iced
milk,
sweetened
with
honey.
I
find
it
most
refreshing
in
this
heat.”

There
was
no
denying
the
heat;
Ned
could
feel
the
silk
tunic
clinging
to
his
chest.
Thick,
moist
air
covered
the
city
like
a
damp
woolen
blanket,
and
the
riverside
had
grown
unruly
as
the
poor
fled
their
hot,
airless
warrens
to
jostle
for
sleeping
places
near
the
water,
where
the
only
breath
of
wind
was
to
be
found.
“That
would
be
most
kind,”
Ned
said,
seating
himself.

Pycelle
lifted
a
tiny
silver
bell
with
thumb
and
forefinger
and
tinkled
it
gently.
A
slender
young
serving
girl
hurried
into
the
solar.
“Iced
milk
for
the
King’s
Hand
and
myself,
if
you
would
be
so
kind,
child.
Well
sweetened.”

As
the
girl
went
to
fetch
their
drinks,
the
Grand
Maester
knotted
his
fingers
together
and
rested
his
hands
on
his
stomach.
“The
smallfolk
say
that
the
last
year
of
summer
is
always
the
hottest.
It
is
not
so,
yet
ofttimes
it
feels
that
way,
does
it
not?
On
days
like
this,
I
envy
you
northerners
your
summer
snows.”
The
heavy
jeweled
chain
around
the
old
man’s
neck
chinked
softly
as
he
shifted
in
his
seat.
“To
be
sure,
King
Maekar’s
summer
was
hotter
than
this
one,
and
near
as
long.
There
were
fools,
even
in
the
Citadel,
who
took
that
to
mean
that
the
Great
Summer
had
come
at
last,
the
summer
that
never
ends,
but
in
the
seventh
year
it
broke
suddenly,
and
we
had
a
short
autumn
and
a
terrible
long
winter.
Still,
the
heat
was
fierce
while
it
lasted.
Oldtown
steamed
and
sweltered
by
day
and
came
alive
only
by
night.
We
would
walk
in
the
gardens
by
the
river
and
argue
about
the
gods.
I
remember
the
smells
of
those
nights,
my
lord—perfume
and
sweat,
melons
ripe
to
bursting,
peaches
and
pomegranates,
nightshade
and
moonbloom.
I
was
a
young
man
then,
still
forging
my
chain.
The
heat
did
not
exhaust
me
as
it
does
now.”
Pycelle’s
eyes
were
so
heavily
lidded
he
looked
half-asleep.
“My
pardons,
Lord
Eddard.
You
did
not
come
to
hear
foolish
meanderings
of
a
summer
forgotten
before
your
father
was
born.
Forgive
an
old
man
his
wanderings,
if
you
would.
Minds
are
like
swords,
I
do
fear.
The
old
ones
go
to
rust.
Ah,
and
here
is
our
milk.”
The
serving
girl
placed
the
tray
between
them,
and
Pycelle
gave
her
a
smile.
“Sweet
child.”
He
lifted
a
cup,
tasted,
nodded.
“Thank
you.
You
may
go.”

When
the
girl
had
taken
her
leave,
Pycelle
peered
at
Ned
through
pale,
rheumy
eyes.
“Now
where
were
we?
Oh,
yes.
You
asked
about
Lord
Arryn…”

“I
did.”
Ned
sipped
politely
at
the
iced
milk.
It
was
pleasantly
cold,
but
oversweet
to
his
taste.

“If
truth
be
told,
the
Hand
had
not
seemed
quite
himself
for
some
time,”
Pycelle
said.
“We
had
sat
together
on
council
many
a
year,
he
and
I,
and
the
signs
were
there
to
read,
but
I
put
them
down
to
the
great
burdens
he
had
borne
so
faithfully
for
so
long.
Those
broad
shoulders
were
weighed
down
by
all
the
cares
of
the
realm,
and
more
besides.
His
son
was
ever
sickly,
and
his
lady
wife
so
anxious
that
she
would
scarcely
let
the
boy
out
of
her
sight.
It
was
enough
to
weary
even
a
strong
man,
and
the
Lord
Jon
was
not
young.
Small
wonder
if
he
seemed
melancholy
and
tired.
Or
so
I
thought
at
the
time.
Yet
now
I
am
less
certain.”
He
gave
a
ponderous
shake
of
his
head.

“What
can
you
tell
me
of
his
final
illness?”

The
Grand
Maester
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
helpless
sorrow.
“He
came
to
me
one
day
asking
after
a
certain
book,
as
hale
and
healthy
as
ever,
though
it
did
seem
to
me
that
something
was
troubling
him
deeply.
The
next
morning
he
was
twisted
over
in
pain,
too
sick
to
rise
from
bed.
Maester
Colemon
thought
it
was
a
chill
on
the
stomach.
The
weather
had
been
hot,
and
the
Hand
often
iced
his
wine,
which
can
upset
the
digestion.
When
Lord
Jon
continued
to
weaken,
I
went
to
him
myself,
but
the
gods
did
not
grant
me
the
power
to
save
him.”

“I
have
heard
that
you
sent
Maester
Colemon
away.”

The
Grand
Maester’s
nod
was
as
slow
and
deliberate
as
a
glacier.
“I
did,
and
I
fear
the
Lady
Lysa
will
never
forgive
me
that.
Maybe
I
was
wrong,
but
at
the
time
I
thought
it
best.
Maester
Colemon
is
like
a
son
to
me,
and
I
yield
to
none
in
my
esteem
for
his
abilities,
but
he
is
young,
and
the
young
ofttimes
do
not
comprehend
the
frailty
of
an
older
body.
He
was
purging
Lord
Arryn
with
wasting
potions
and
pepper
juice,
and
I
feared
he
might
kill
him.”

“Did
Lord
Arryn
say
anything
to
you
during
his
final
hours?”

Pycelle
wrinkled
his
brow.
“In
the
last
stage
of
his
fever,
the
Hand
called
out
the
name
Robert
several
times,
but
whether
he
was
asking
for
his
son
or
for
the
king
I
could
not
say.
Lady
Lysa
would
not
permit
the
boy
to
enter
the
sickroom,
for
fear
that
he
too
might
be
taken
ill.
The
king
did
come,
and
he
sat
beside
the
bed
for
hours,
talking
and
joking
of
times
long
past
in
hopes
of
raising
Lord
Jon’s
spirits.
His
love
was
fierce
to
see.”

“Was
there
nothing
else?
No
final
words?”

“When
I
saw
that
all
hope
had
fled,
I
gave
the
Hand
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
so
he
should
not
suffer.
Just
before
he
closed
his
eyes
for
the
last
time,
he
whispered
something
to
the
king
and
his
lady
wife,
a
blessing
for
his
son.
The
seed
is
strong,
he
said.
At
the
end,
his
speech
was
too
slurred
to
comprehend.
Death
did
not
come
until
the
next
morning,
but
Lord
Jon
was
at
peace
after
that.
He
never
spoke
again.”

Ned
took
another
swallow
of
milk,
trying
not
to
gag
on
the
sweetness
of
it.
“Did
it
seem
to
you
that
there
was
anything
unnatural
about
Lord
Arryn’s
death?”

“Unnatural?”
The
aged
maester’s
voice
was
thin
as
a
whisper.
“No,
I
could
not
say
so.
Sad,
for
a
certainty.
Yet
in
its
own
way,
death
is
the
most
natural
thing
of
all,
Lord
Eddard.
Jon
Arryn
rests
easy
now,
his
burdens
lifted
at
last.”

“This
illness
that
took
him,”
said
Ned.
“Had
you
ever
seen
its
like
before,
in
other
men?”

“Near
forty
years
I
have
been
Grand
Maester
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Pycelle
replied.
“Under
our
good
King
Robert,
and
Aerys
Targaryen
before
him,
and
his
father
Jaehaerys
the
Second
before
him,
and
even
for
a
few
short
months
under
Jaehaerys’s
father,
Aegon
the
Fortunate,
the
Fifth
of
His
Name.
I
have
seen
more
of
illness
than
I
care
to
remember,
my
lord.
I
will
tell
you
this:
Every
case
is
different,
and
every
case
is
alike.
Lord
Jon’s
death
was
no
stranger
than
any
other.”

“His
wife
thought
otherwise.”

The
Grand
Maester
nodded.
“I
recall
now,
the
widow
is
sister
to
your
own
noble
wife.
If
an
old
man
may
be
forgiven
his
blunt
speech,
let
me
say
that
grief
can
derange
even
the
strongest
and
most
disciplined
of
minds,
and
the
Lady
Lysa
was
never
that.
Since
her
last
stillbirth,
she
has
seen
enemies
in
every
shadow,
and
the
death
of
her
lord
husband
left
her
shattered
and
lost.”

“So
you
are
quite
certain
that
Jon
Arryn
died
of
a
sudden
illness?”

“I
am,”
Pycelle
replied
gravely.
“If
not
illness,
my
good
lord,
what
else
could
it
be?”

“Poison,”
Ned
suggested
quietly.

Pycelle’s
sleepy
eyes
flicked
open.
The
aged
maester
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
seat.
“A
disturbing
thought.
We
are
not
the
Free
Cities,
where
such
things
are
common.
Grand
Maester
Aethelmure
wrote
that
all
men
carry
murder
in
their
hearts,
yet
even
so,
the
poisoner
is
beneath
contempt.”
He
fell
silent
for
a
moment,
his
eyes
lost
in
thought.
“What
you
suggest
is
possible,
my
lord,
yet
I
do
not
think
it
likely.
Every
hedge
maester
knows
the
common
poisons,
and
Lord
Arryn
displayed
none
of
the
signs.
And
the
Hand
was
loved
by
all.
What
sort
of
monster
in
man’s
flesh
would
dare
to
murder
such
a
noble
lord?”

“I
have
heard
it
said
that
poison
is
a
woman’s
weapon.”

Pycelle
stroked
his
beard
thoughtfully.
“It
is
said.
Women,
cravens…
and
eunuchs.”
He
cleared
his
throat
and
spat
a
thick
glob
of
phelm
onto
the
rushes.
Above
them,
a
raven
cawed
loudly
in
the
rookery.
“The
Lord
Varys
was
born
a
slave
in
Lys,
did
you
know?
Put
not
your
trust
in
spiders,
my
lord.”

That
was
scarcely
anything
Ned
needed
to
be
told;
there
was
something
about
Varys
that
made
his
flesh
crawl.
“I
will
remember
that,
Maester.
And
I
thank
you
for
your
help.
I
have
taken
enough
of
your
time.”
He
stood.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
pushed
himself
up
from
his
chair
slowly
and
escorted
Ned
to
the
door.
“I
hope
I
have
helped
in
some
small
way
to
put
your
mind
at
ease.
If
there
is
any
other
service
I
might
perform,
you
need
only
ask.”

“One
thing,”
Ned
told
him.
“I
should
be
curious
to
examine
the
book
that
you
lent
Jon
the
day
before
he
fell
ill.”

“I
fear
you
would
find
it
of
little
interest,”
Pycelle
said.
“It
was
a
ponderous
tome
by
Grand
Maester
Malleon
on
the
lineages
of
the
great
houses.”

“Still,
I
should
like
to
see
it.”

The
old
man
opened
the
door.
“As
you
wish.
I
have
it
here
somewhere.
When
I
find
it,
I
shall
have
it
sent
to
your
chambers
straightaway.”

“You
have
been
most
courteous,”
Ned
told
him.
Then,
almost
as
an
afterthought,
he
said,
“One
last
question,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.
You
mentioned
that
the
king
was
at
Lord
Arryn’s
bedside
when
he
died.
I
wonder,
was
the
queen
with
him?”

“Why,
no,”
Pycelle
said.
“She
and
the
children
were
making
the
journey
to
Casterly
Rock,
in
company
with
her
father.
Lord
Tywin
had
brought
a
retinue
to
the
city
for
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day,
no
doubt
hoping
to
see
his
son
Jaime
win
the
champion’s
crown.
In
that
he
was
sadly
disappointed.
It
fell
to
me
to
send
the
queen
word
of
Lord
Arryn’s
sudden
death.
Never
have
I
sent
off
a
bird
with
a
heavier
heart.”

“Dark
wings,
dark
words,”
Ned
murmured.
It
was
a
proverb
Old
Nan
had
taught
him
as
a
boy.

“So
the
fishwives
say,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
agreed,
“but
we
know
it
is
not
always
so.
When
Maester
Luwin’s
bird
brought
the
word
about
your
Bran,
the
message
lifted
every
true
heart
in
the
castle,
did
it
not?”

“As
you
say,
Maester.”

“The
gods
are
merciful.”
Pycelle
bowed
his
head.
“Come
to
me
as
often
as
you
like,
Lord
Eddard.
I
am
here
to
serve.”

Yes,
Ned
thought
as
the
door
swung
shut,
but
whom?

On
the
way
back
to
his
chambers,
he
came
upon
his
daughter
Arya
on
the
winding
steps
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
windmilling
her
arms
as
she
struggled
to
balance
on
one
leg.
The
rough
stone
had
scuffed
her
bare
feet.
Ned
stopped
and
looked
at
her.
“Arya,
what
are
you
doing?”

“Syrio
says
a
water
dancer
can
stand
on
one
toe
for
hours.”
Her
hands
flailed
at
the
air
to
steady
herself.

Ned
had
to
smile.
“Which
toe?”
he
teased.

“Any
toe,”
Arya
said,
exasperated
with
the
question.
She
hopped
from
her
right
leg
to
her
left,
swaying
dangerously
before
she
regained
her
balance.

“Must
you
do
your
standing
here?”
he
asked.
“It’s
a
long
hard
fall
down
these
steps.”

“Syrio
says
a
water
dancer
never
falls.”
She
lowered
her
leg
to
stand
on
two
feet.
“Father,
will
Bran
come
and
live
with
us
now?”

“Not
for
a
long
time,
sweet
one,”
he
told
her.
“He
needs
to
win
his
strength
back.”

Arya
bit
her
lip.
“What
will
Bran
do
when
he’s
of
age?”

Ned
knelt
beside
her.
“He
has
years
to
find
that
answer,
Arya.
For
now,
it
is
enough
to
know
that
he
will
live.”
The
night
the
bird
had
come
from
Winterfell,
Eddard
Stark
had
taken
the
girls
to
the
castle
godswood,
an
acre
of
elm
and
alder
and
black
cottonwood
overlooking
the
river.
The
heart
tree
there
was
a
great
oak,
its
ancient
limbs
overgrown
with
smokeberry
vines;
they
knelt
before
it
to
offer
their
thanksgiving,
as
if
it
had
been
a
weirwood.
Sansa
drifted
to
sleep
as
the
moon
rose,
Arya
several
hours
later,
curling
up
in
the
grass
under
Ned’s
cloak.
All
through
the
dark
hours
he
kept
his
vigil
alone.
When
dawn
broke
over
the
city,
the
dark
red
blooms
of
dragon’s
breath
surrounded
the
girls
where
they
lay.
“I
dreamed
of
Bran,”
Sansa
had
whispered
to
him.
“I
saw
him
smiling.”

“He
was
going
to
be
a
knight,”
Arya
was
saying
now.
“A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
Can
he
still
be
a
knight?”

“No,”
Ned
said.
He
saw
no
use
in
lying
to
her.
“Yet
someday
he
may
be
the
lord
of
a
great
holdfast
and
sit
on
the
king’s
council.
He
might
raise
castles
like
Brandon
the
Builder,
or
sail
a
ship
across
the
Sunset
Sea,
or
enter
your
mother’s
Faith
and
become
the
High
Septon.”
But
he
will
never
run
beside
his
wolf
again,
he
thought
with
a
sadness
too
deep
for
words,
or
lie
with
a
woman,
or
hold
his
own
son
in
his
arms.

Arya
cocked
her
head
to
one
side.
“Can
I
be
a
king’s
councillor
and
build
castles
and
become
the
High
Septon?”

“You,”
Ned
said,
kissing
her
lightly
on
the
brow,
“will
marry
a
king
and
rule
his
castle,
and
your
sons
will
be
knights
and
princes
and
lords
and,
yes,
perhaps
even
a
High
Septon.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face.
“No,”
she
said,
“that’s
Sansa.”
She
folded
up
her
right
leg
and
resumed
her
balancing.
Ned
sighed
and
left
her
there.

Inside
his
chambers,
he
stripped
off
his
sweat-stained
silks
and
sluiced
cold
water
over
his
head
from
the
basin
beside
the
bed.
Alyn
entered
as
he
was
drying
his
face.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“Lord
Baelish
is
without
and
begs
audience.”

“Escort
him
to
my
solar,”
Ned
said,
reaching
for
a
fresh
tunic,
the
lightest
linen
he
could
find.
“I’ll
see
him
at
once.”

Littlefinger
was
perched
on
the
window
seat
when
Ned
entered,
watching
the
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
practice
at
swords
in
the
yard
below.
“If
only
old
Selmy’s
mind
were
as
nimble
as
his
blade,”
he
said
wistfully,
“our
council
meetings
would
be
a
good
deal
livelier.”

“Ser
Barristan
is
as
valiant
and
honorable
as
any
man
in
King’s
Landing.”
Ned
had
come
to
have
a
deep
respect
for
the
aged,
white-haired
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.

“And
as
tiresome,”
Littlefinger
added,
“though
I
daresay
he
should
do
well
in
the
tourney.
Last
year
he
unhorsed
the
Hound,
and
it
was
only
four
years
ago
that
he
was
champion.”

The
question
of
who
might
win
the
tourney
interested
Eddard
Stark
not
in
the
least.
“Is
there
a
reason
for
this
visit,
Lord
Petyr,
or
are
you
here
simply
to
enjoy
the
view
from
my
window?”

Littlefinger
smiled.
“I
promised
Cat
I
would
help
you
in
your
inquiries,
and
so
I
have.”

That
took
Ned
aback.
Promise
or
no
promise,
he
could
not
find
it
in
him
to
trust
Lord
Petyr
Baelish,
who
struck
him
as
too
clever
by
half.
“You
have
something
for
me?”

“Someone,”
Littlefinger
corrected.
“Four
someones,
if
truth
be
told.
Had
you
thought
to
question
the
Hand’s
servants?”

Ned
frowned.
“Would
that
I
could.
Lady
Arryn
took
her
household
back
to
the
Eyrie.”
Lysa
had
done
him
no
favor
in
that
regard.
All
those
who
had
stood
closest
to
her
husband
had
gone
with
her
when
she
fled:
Jon’s
maester,
his
steward,
the
captain
of
his
guard,
his
knights
and
retainers.

“Most
of
her
household,”
Littlefinger
said,
“not
all.
A
few
remain.
A
pregnant
kitchen
girl
hastily
wed
to
one
of
Lord
Renly’s
grooms,
a
stablehand
who
joined
the
City
Watch,
a
potboy
discharged
from
service
for
theft,
and
Lord
Arryn’s
squire.”

“His
squire?”
Ned
was
pleasantly
surprised.
A
man’s
squire
often
knew
a
great
deal
of
his
comings
and
goings.

“Ser
Hugh
of
the
Vale,”
Littlefinger
named
him.
“The
king
knighted
the
boy
after
Lord
Arryn’s
death.”

“I
shall
send
for
him,”
Ned
said.
“And
the
others.”

Littlefinger
winced.
“My
lord,
step
over
here
to
the
window,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

“Why?”

“Come,
and
I’ll
show
you,
my
lord.”

Frowning,
Ned
crossed
to
the
window.
Petyr
Baelish
made
a
casual
gesture.
“There,
across
the
yard,
at
the
door
of
the
armory,
do
you
see
the
boy
squatting
by
the
steps
honing
a
sword
with
an
oilstone?”

“What
of
him?”

“He
reports
to
Varys.
The
Spider
has
taken
a
great
interest
in
you
and
all
your
doings.”
He
shifted
in
the
window
seat.
“Now
glance
at
the
wall.
Farther
west,
above
the
stables.
The
guardsman
leaning
on
the
ramparts?”

Ned
saw
the
man.
“Another
of
the
eunuch’s
whisperers?”

“No,
this
one
belongs
to
the
queen.
Notice
that
he
enjoys
a
fine
view
of
the
door
to
this
tower,
the
better
to
note
who
calls
on
you.
There
are
others,
many
unknown
even
to
me.
The
Red
Keep
is
full
of
eyes.
Why
do
you
think
I
hid
Cat
in
a
brothel?”

Eddard
Stark
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues.
“Seven
hells,”
he
swore.
It
did
seem
as
though
the
man
on
the
walls
was
watching
him.
Suddenly
uncomfortable,
Ned
moved
away
from
the
window.
“Is
everyone
someone’s
informer
in
this
cursed
city?”

“Scarcely,”
said
Littlefinger.
He
counted
on
the
fingers
on
his
hand.
“Why,
there’s
me,
you,
the
king…
although,
come
to
think
on
it,
the
king
tells
the
queen
much
too
much,
and
I’m
less
than
certain
about
you.”
He
stood
up.
“Is
there
a
man
in
your
service
that
you
trust
utterly
and
completely?”

“Yes,”
said
Ned.

“In
that
case,
I
have
a
delightful
palace
in
Valyria
that
I
would
dearly
love
to
sell
you,”
Littlefinger
said
with
a
mocking
smile.
“The
wiser
answer
was
no,
my
lord,
but
be
that
as
it
may.
Send
this
paragon
of
yours
to
Ser
Hugh
and
the
others.
Your
own
comings
and
goings
will
be
noted,
but
even
Varys
the
Spider
cannot
watch
every
man
in
your
service
every
hour
of
the
day.”
He
started
for
the
door.

“Lord
Petyr,”
Ned
called
after
him.
“I…
am
grateful
for
your
help.
Perhaps
I
was
wrong
to
distrust
you.”

Littlefinger
fingered
his
small
pointed
beard.
“You
are
slow
to
learn,
Lord
Eddard.
Distrusting
me
was
the
wisest
thing
you’ve
done
since
you
climbed
down
off
your
horse.”





JON

Jon
was
showing
Dareon
how
best
to
deliver
a
sidestroke
when
the
new
recruit
entered
the
practice
yard.
“Your
feet
should
be
farther
apart,”
he
urged.
“You
don’t
want
to
lose
your
balance.
That’s
good.
Now
pivot
as
you
deliver
the
stroke,
get
all
your
weight
behind
the
blade.”

Dareon
broke
off
and
lifted
his
visor.
“Seven
gods,”
he
murmured.
“Would
you
look
at
this,
Jon.”

Jon
turned.
Through
the
eye
slit
of
his
helm,
he
beheld
the
fattest
boy
he
had
ever
seen
standing
in
the
door
of
the
armory.
By
the
look
of
him,
he
must
have
weighed
twenty
stone.
The
fur
collar
of
his
embroidered
surcoat
was
lost
beneath
his
chins.
Pale
eyes
moved
nervously
in
a
great
round
moon
of
a
face,
and
plump
sweaty
fingers
wiped
themselves
on
the
velvet
of
his
doublet.
“They…
they
told
me
I
was
to
come
here
for…
for
training,”
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular.

“A
lordling,”
Pyp
observed
to
Jon.
“Southron,
most
like
near
Highgarden.”
Pyp
had
traveled
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
a
mummers’
troupe,
and
bragged
that
he
could
tell
what
you
were
and
where
you’d
been
born
just
from
the
sound
of
your
voice.

A
striding
huntsman
had
been
worked
in
scarlet
thread
upon
the
breast
of
the
fat
boy’s
fur-trimmed
surcoat.
Jon
did
not
recognize
the
sigil.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
looked
over
his
new
charge
and
said,
“It
would
seem
they
have
run
short
of
poachers
and
thieves
down
south.
Now
they
send
us
pigs
to
man
the
Wall.
Is
fur
and
velvet
your
notion
of
armor,
my
Lord
of
Ham?”

It
was
soon
revealed
that
the
new
recruit
had
brought
his
own
armor
with
him;
padded
doublet,
boiled
leather,
mail
and
plate
and
helm,
even
a
great
wood-and-leather
shield
blazoned
with
the
same
striding
huntsman
he
wore
on
his
surcoat.
As
none
of
it
was
black,
however,
Ser
Alliser
insisted
that
he
reequip
himself
from
the
armory.
That
took
half
the
morning.
His
girth
required
Donal
Noye
to
take
apart
a
mail
hauberk
and
refit
it
with
leather
panels
at
the
sides.
To
get
a
helm
over
his
head
the
armorer
had
to
detach
the
visor.
His
leathers
bound
so
tightly
around
his
legs
and
under
his
arms
that
he
could
scarcely
move.
Dressed
for
battle,
the
new
boy
looked
like
an
overcooked
sausage
about
to
burst
its
skin.
“Let
us
hope
you
are
not
as
inept
as
you
look,”
Ser
Alliser
said.
“Halder,
see
what
Ser
Piggy
can
do.”

Jon
Snow
winced.
Halder
had
been
born
in
a
quarry
and
apprenticed
as
a
stonemason.
He
was
sixteen,
tall
and
muscular,
and
his
blows
were
as
hard
as
any
Jon
had
ever
felt.
“This
will
be
uglier
than
a
whore’s
ass,”
Pyp
muttered,
and
it
was.

The
fight
lasted
less
than
a
minute
before
the
fat
boy
was
on
the
ground,
his
whole
body
shaking
as
blood
leaked
through
his
shattered
helm
and
between
his
pudgy
fingers.
“I
yield,”
he
shrilled.
“No
more,
I
yield,
don’t
hit
me.”
Rast
and
some
of
the
other
boys
were
laughing.

Even
then,
Ser
Alliser
would
not
call
an
end.
“On
your
feet,
Ser
Piggy,”
he
called.
“Pick
up
your
sword.”
When
the
boy
continued
to
cling
to
the
ground,
Thorne
gestured
to
Halder.
“Hit
him
with
the
flat
of
your
blade
until
he
finds
his
feet.”
Halder
delivered
a
tentative
smack
to
his
foe’s
upraised
cheeks.
“You
can
hit
harder
than
that,”
Thorne
taunted.
Halder
took
hold
of
his
longsword
with
both
hands
and
brought
it
down
so
hard
the
blow
split
leather,
even
on
the
flat.
The
new
boy
screeched
in
pain.

Jon
Snow
took
a
step
forward.
Pyp
laid
a
mailed
hand
on
his
arm.
“Jon,
no,”
the
small
boy
whispered
with
an
anxious
glance
at
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.

“On
your
feet,”
Thorne
repeated.
The
fat
boy
struggled
to
rise,
slipped,
and
fell
heavily
again.
“Ser
Piggy
is
starting
to
grasp
the
notion,”
Ser
Alliser
observed.
“Again.”

Halder
lifted
the
sword
for
another
blow.
“Cut
us
off
a
ham!”
Rast
urged,
laughing.

Jon
shook
off
Pyp’s
hand.
“Halder,
enough.”

Halder
looked
to
Ser
Alliser.

“The
Bastard
speaks
and
the
peasants
tremble,”
the
master-at-arms
said
in
that
sharp,
cold
voice
of
his.
“I
remind
you
that
I
am
the
master-at-arms
here,
Lord
Snow.”

“Look
at
him,
Halder,”
Jon
urged,
ignoring
Thorne
as
best
he
could.
“There’s
no
honor
in
beating
a
fallen
foe.
He
yielded.”
He
knelt
beside
the
fat
boy.

Halder
lowered
his
sword.
“He
yielded,”
he
echoed.

Ser
Alliser’s
onyx
eyes
were
fixed
on
Jon
Snow.
“It
would
seem
our
Bastard
is
in
love,”
he
said
as
Jon
helped
the
fat
boy
to
his
feet.
“Show
me
your
steel,
Lord
Snow.”

Jon
drew
his
longsword.
He
dared
defy
Ser
Alliser
only
to
a
point,
and
he
feared
he
was
well
beyond
it
now.

Thorne
smiled.
“The
Bastard
wishes
to
defend
his
lady
love,
so
we
shall
make
an
exercise
of
it.
Rat,
Pimple,
help
our
Stone
Head
here.”
Rast
and
Albett
moved
to
join
Halder.
“Three
of
you
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
make
Lady
Piggy
squeal.
All
you
need
do
is
get
past
the
Bastard.”

“Stay
behind
me,”
Jon
said
to
the
fat
boy.
Ser
Alliser
had
often
sent
two
foes
against
him,
but
never
three.
He
knew
he
would
likely
go
to
sleep
bruised
and
bloody
tonight.
He
braced
himself
for
the
assault.

Suddenly
Pyp
was
beside
him.
“Three
to
two
will
make
for
better
sport,”
the
small
boy
said
cheerfully.
He
dropped
his
visor
and
slid
out
his
sword.
Before
Jon
could
even
think
to
protest,
Grenn
had
stepped
up
to
make
a
third.

The
yard
had
grown
deathly
quiet.
Jon
could
feel
Ser
Alliser’s
eyes.
“Why
are
you
waiting?”
he
asked
Rast
and
the
others
in
a
voice
gone
deceptively
soft,
but
it
was
Jon
who
moved
first.
Halder
barely
got
his
sword
up
in
time.

Jon
drove
him
backward,
attacking
with
every
blow,
keeping
the
older
boy
on
the
heels.
Know
your
foe,
Ser
Rodrik
had
taught
him
once;
Jon
knew
Halder,
brutally
strong
but
short
of
patience,
with
no
taste
for
defense.
Frustrate
him,
and
he
would
leave
himself
open,
as
certain
as
sunset.

The
clang
of
steel
echoed
through
the
yard
as
the
others
joined
battle
around
him.
Jon
blocked
a
savage
cut
at
his
head,
the
shock
of
impact
running
up
his
arm
as
the
swords
crashed
together.
He
slammed
a
sidestroke
into
Halder’s
ribs,
and
was
rewarded
with
a
muffled
grunt
of
pain.
The
counterstroke
caught
Jon
on
the
shoulder.
Chainmail
crunched,
and
pain
flared
up
his
neck,
but
for
an
instant
Halder
was
unbalanced.
Jon
cut
his
left
leg
from
under
him,
and
he
fell
with
a
curse
and
a
crash.

Grenn
was
standing
his
ground
as
Jon
had
taught
him,
giving
Albett
more
than
he
cared
for,
but
Pyp
was
hard-pressed.
Rast
had
two
years
and
forty
pounds
on
him.
Jon
stepped
up
behind
him
and
rang
the
raper’s
helm
like
a
bell.
As
Rast
went
reeling,
Pyp
slid
in
under
his
guard,
knocked
him
down,
and
leveled
a
blade
at
his
throat.
By
then
Jon
had
moved
on.
Facing
two
swords,
Albett
backed
away.
“I
yield,”
he
shouted.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
surveyed
the
scene
with
disgust.
“The
mummer’s
farce
has
gone
on
long
enough
for
today.”
He
walked
away.
The
session
was
at
an
end.

Dareon
helped
Halder
to
his
feet.
The
quarryman’s
son
wrenched
off
his
helm
and
threw
it
across
the
yard.
“For
an
instant,
I
thought
I
finally
had
you,
Snow.”

“For
an
instant,
you
did,”
Jon
replied.
Under
his
mail
and
leather,
his
shoulder
was
throbbing.
He
sheathed
his
sword
and
tried
to
remove
his
helm,
but
when
he
raised
his
arm,
the
pain
made
him
grit
his
teeth.

“Let
me,”
a
voice
said.
Thick-fingered
hands
unfastened
helm
from
gorget
and
lifted
it
off
gently.
“Did
he
hurt
you?”

“I’ve
been
bruised
before.”
He
touched
his
shoulder
and
winced.
The
yard
was
emptying
around
them.

Blood
matted
the
fat
boy’s
hair
where
Halder
had
split
his
helm
asunder.
“My
name
is
Samwell
Tarly,
of
Horn…”
He
stopped
and
licked
his
lips.
“I
mean,
I
was
of
Horn
Hill,
until
I…
left.
I’ve
come
to
take
the
black.
My
father
is
Lord
Randyll,
a
bannerman
to
the
Tyrells
of
Highgarden.
I
used
to
be
his
heir,
only…”
His
voice
trailed
off.

“I’m
Jon
Snow,
Ned
Stark’s
bastard,
of
Winterfell.”

Samwell
Tarly
nodded.
“I…
if
you
want,
you
can
call
me
Sam.
My
mother
calls
me
Sam.”

“You
can
call
him
Lord
Snow,”
Pyp
said
as
he
came
up
to
join
them.
“You
don’t
want
to
know
what
his
mother
calls
him.”

“These
two
are
Grenn
and
Pypar,”
Jon
said.

“Grenn’s
the
ugly
one,”
Pyp
said.

Grenn
scowled.
“You’re
uglier
than
me.
At
least
I
don’t
have
ears
like
a
bat.”

“My
thanks
to
all
of
you,”
the
fat
boy
said
gravely.

“Why
didn’t
you
get
up
and
fight?”
Grenn
demanded.

“I
wanted
to,
truly.
I
just…
I
couldn’t.
I
didn’t
want
him
to
hit
me
anymore.”
He
looked
at
the
ground.
“I…
I
fear
I’m
a
coward.
My
lord
father
always
said
so.”

Grenn
looked
thunderstruck.
Even
Pyp
had
no
words
to
say
to
that,
and
Pyp
had
words
for
everything.
What
sort
of
man
would
proclaim
himself
a
coward?

Samwell
Tarly
must
have
read
their
thoughts
on
their
faces.
His
eyes
met
Jon’s
and
darted
away,
quick
as
frightened
animals.
“I…
I’m
sorry,”
he
said.
“I
don’t
mean
to…
to
be
like
I
am.”
He
walked
heavily
toward
the
armory.

Jon
called
after
him.
“You
were
hurt,”
he
said.
“Tomorrow
you’ll
do
better.”

Sam
looked
mournfully
back
over
one
shoulder.
“No
I
won’t,”
he
said,
blinking
back
tears.
“I
never
do
better.”

When
he
was
gone,
Grenn
frowned.
“Nobody
likes
cravens,”
he
said
uncomfortably.
“I
wish
we
hadn’t
helped
him.
What
if
they
think
we’re
craven
too?”

“You’re
too
stupid
to
be
craven,”
Pyp
told
him.

“I
am
not,”
Grenn
said.

“Yes
you
are.
If
a
bear
attacked
you
in
the
woods,
you’d
be
too
stupid
to
run
away.”

“I
would
not,”
Grenn
insisted.
“I’d
run
away
faster
than
you.”
He
stopped
suddenly,
scowling
when
he
saw
Pyp’s
grin
and
realized
what
he’d
just
said.
His
thick
neck
flushed
a
dark
red.
Jon
left
them
there
arguing
as
he
returned
to
the
armory,
hung
up
his
sword,
and
stripped
off
his
battered
armor.

Life
at
Castle
Black
followed
certain
patterns;
the
mornings
were
for
swordplay,
the
afternoons
for
work.
The
black
brothers
set
new
recruits
to
many
different
tasks,
to
learn
where
their
skills
lay.
Jon
cherished
the
rare
afternoons
when
he
was
sent
out
with
Ghost
ranging
at
his
side
to
bring
back
game
for
the
Lord
Commander’s
table,
but
for
every
day
spent
hunting,
he
gave
a
dozen
to
Donal
Noye
in
the
armory,
spinning
the
whetstone
while
the
one-armed
smith
sharpened
axes
grown
dull
from
use,
or
pumping
the
bellows
as
Noye
hammered
out
a
new
sword.
Other
times
he
ran
messages,
stood
at
guard,
mucked
out
stables,
fletched
arrows,
assisted
Maester
Aemon
with
his
birds
or
Bowen
Marsh
with
his
counts
and
inventories.

That
afternoon,
the
watch
commander
sent
him
to
the
winch
cage
with
four
barrels
of
fresh-crushed
stone,
to
scatter
gravel
over
the
icy
footpaths
atop
the
Wall.
It
was
lonely
and
boring
work,
even
with
Ghost
along
for
company,
but
Jon
found
he
did
not
mind.
On
a
clear
day
you
could
see
half
the
world
from
the
top
of
the
Wall,
and
the
air
was
always
cold
and
bracing.
He
could
think
here,
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
Samwell
Tarly…
and,
oddly,
of
Tyrion
Lannister.
He
wondered
what
Tyrion
would
have
made
of
the
fat
boy.
Most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it,
the
dwarf
had
told
him,
grinning.
The
world
was
full
of
cravens
who
pretended
to
be
heroes;
it
took
a
queer
sort
of
courage
to
admit
to
cowardice
as
Samwell
Tarly
had.

His
sore
shoulder
made
the
work
go
slowly.
It
was
late
afternoon
before
Jon
finished
graveling
the
paths.
He
lingered
on
high
to
watch
the
sun
go
down,
turning
the
western
sky
the
color
of
blood.
Finally,
as
dusk
was
settling
over
the
north,
Jon
rolled
the
empty
barrels
back
into
the
cage
and
signaled
the
winch
men
to
lower
him.

The
evening
meal
was
almost
done
by
the
time
he
and
Ghost
reached
the
common
hall.
A
group
of
the
black
brothers
were
dicing
over
mulled
wine
near
the
fire.
His
friends
were
at
the
bench
nearest
the
west
wall,
laughing.
Pyp
was
in
the
middle
of
a
story.
The
mummer’s
boy
with
the
big
ears
was
a
born
liar
with
a
hundred
different
voices,
and
he
did
not
tell
his
tales
so
much
as
live
them,
playing
all
the
parts
as
needed,
a
king
one
moment
and
a
swineherd
the
next.
When
he
turned
into
an
alehouse
girl
or
a
virgin
princess,
he
used
a
high
falsetto
voice
that
reduced
them
all
to
tears
of
helpless
laughter,
and
his
eunuchs
were
always
eerily
accurate
caricatures
of
Ser
Alliser.
Jon
took
as
much
pleasure
from
Pyp’s
antics
as
anyone…
yet
that
night
he
turned
away
and
went
instead
to
the
end
of
the
bench,
where
Samwell
Tarly
sat
alone,
as
far
from
the
others
as
he
could
get.

He
was
finishing
the
last
of
the
pork
pie
the
cooks
had
served
up
for
supper
when
Jon
sat
down
across
from
him.
The
fat
boy’s
eyes
widened
at
the
sight
of
Ghost.
“Is
that
a
wolf?”

“A
direwolf,”
Jon
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.
The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
my
father’s
House.”

“Ours
is
a
striding
huntsman,”
Samwell
Tarly
said.

“Do
you
like
to
hunt?”

The
fat
boy
shuddered.
“I
hate
it.”
He
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
cry
again.

“What’s
wrong
now?”
Jon
asked
him.
“Why
are
you
always
so
frightened?”

Sam
stared
at
the
last
of
his
pork
pie
and
gave
a
feeble
shake
of
his
head,
too
scared
even
to
talk.
A
burst
of
laughter
filled
the
hall.
Jon
heard
Pyp
squeaking
in
a
high
voice.
He
stood.
“Let’s
go
outside.”

The
round
fat
face
looked
up
at
him,
suspicious.
“Why?
What
will
we
do
outside?”

“Talk,”
Jon
said.
“Have
you
seen
the
Wall?”

“I’m
fat,
not
blind,”
Samwell
Tarly
said.
“Of
course
I
saw
it,
it’s
seven
hundred
feet
high.”
Yet
he
stood
up
all
the
same,
wrapped
a
fur-lined
cloak
over
his
shoulders,
and
followed
Jon
from
the
common
hall,
still
wary,
as
if
he
suspected
some
cruel
trick
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
night.
Ghost
padded
along
beside
them.
“I
never
thought
it
would
be
like
this,”
Sam
said
as
they
walked,
his
words
steaming
in
the
cold
air.
Already
he
was
huffing
and
puffing
as
he
tried
to
keep
up.
“All
the
buildings
are
falling
down,
and
it’s
so…
so…”

“Cold?”
A
hard
frost
was
settling
over
the
castle,
and
Jon
could
hear
the
soft
crunch
of
grey
weeds
beneath
his
boots.

Sam
nodded
miserably.
“I
hate
the
cold,”
he
said.
“Last
night
I
woke
up
in
the
dark
and
the
fire
had
gone
out
and
I
was
certain
I
was
going
to
freeze
to
death
by
morning.”

“It
must
have
been
warmer
where
you
come
from.”

“I
never
saw
snow
until
last
month.
We
were
crossing
the
barrowlands,
me
and
the
men
my
father
sent
to
see
me
north,
and
this
white
stuff
began
to
fall,
like
a
soft
rain.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
so
beautiful,
like
feathers
drifting
from
the
sky,
but
it
kept
on
and
on,
until
I
was
frozen
to
the
bone.
The
men
had
crusts
of
snow
in
their
beards
and
more
on
their
shoulders,
and
still
it
kept
coming.
I
was
afraid
it
would
never
end.”

Jon
smiled.

The
Wall
loomed
before
them,
glimmering
palely
in
the
light
of
the
half
moon.
In
the
sky
above,
the
stars
burned
clear
and
sharp.
“Are
they
going
to
make
me
go
up
there?”
Sam
asked.
His
face
curdled
like
old
milk
as
he
looked
at
the
great
wooden
stairs.
“I’ll
die
if
I
have
to
climb
that.”

“There’s
a
winch,”
Jon
said,
pointing.
“They
can
draw
you
up
in
a
cage.”

Samwell
Tarly
sniffled.
“I
don’t
like
high
places.”

It
was
too
much.
Jon
frowned,
incredulous.
“Are
you
afraid
of
everything?”
he
asked.
“I
don’t
understand.
If
you
are
truly
so
craven,
why
are
you
here?
Why
would
a
coward
want
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch?”

Samwell
Tarly
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment,
and
his
round
face
seemed
to
cave
in
on
itself.
He
sat
down
on
the
frost-covered
ground
and
began
to
cry,
huge
choking
sobs
that
made
his
whole
body
shake.
Jon
Snow
could
only
stand
and
watch.
Like
the
snowfall
on
the
barrowlands,
it
seemed
the
tears
would
never
end.

It
was
Ghost
who
knew
what
to
do.
Silent
as
shadow,
the
pale
direwolf
moved
closer
and
began
to
lick
the
warm
tears
off
Samwell
Tarly’s
face.
The
fat
boy
cried
out,
startled…
and
somehow,
in
a
heartbeat,
his
sobs
turned
to
laughter.

Jon
Snow
laughed
with
him.
Afterward
they
sat
on
the
frozen
ground,
huddled
in
their
cloaks
with
Ghost
between
them.
Jon
told
the
story
of
how
he
and
Robb
had
found
the
pups
newborn
in
the
late
summer
snows.
It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
now.
Before
long
he
found
himself
talking
of
Winterfell.

“Sometimes
I
dream
about
it,”
he
said.
“I’m
walking
down
this
long
empty
hall.
My
voice
echoes
all
around,
but
no
one
answers,
so
I
walk
faster,
opening
doors,
shouting
names.
I
don’t
even
know
who
I’m
looking
for.
Most
nights
it’s
my
father,
but
sometimes
it’s
Robb
instead,
or
my
little
sister
Arya,
or
my
uncle.”
The
thought
of
Benjen
Stark
saddened
him;
his
uncle
was
still
missing.
The
Old
Bear
had
sent
out
rangers
in
search
of
him.
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
had
led
two
sweeps,
and
Quorin
Halfhand
had
gone
forth
from
the
Shadow
Tower,
but
they’d
found
nothing
aside
from
a
few
blazes
in
the
trees
that
his
uncle
had
left
to
mark
his
way.
In
the
stony
highlands
to
the
northwest,
the
marks
stopped
abruptly
and
all
trace
of
Ben
Stark
vanished.

“Do
you
ever
find
anyone
in
your
dream?”
Sam
asked.

Jon
shook
his
head.
“No
one.
The
castle
is
always
empty.”
He
had
never
told
anyone
of
the
dream,
and
he
did
not
understand
why
he
was
telling
Sam
now,
yet
somehow
it
felt
good
to
talk
of
it.
“Even
the
ravens
are
gone
from
the
rookery,
and
the
stables
are
full
of
bones.
That
always
scares
me.
I
start
to
run
then,
throwing
open
doors,
climbing
the
tower
three
steps
at
a
time,
screaming
for
someone,
for
anyone.
And
then
I
find
myself
in
front
of
the
door
to
the
crypts.
It’s
black
inside,
and
I
can
see
the
steps
spiraling
down.
Somehow
I
know
I
have
to
go
down
there,
but
I
don’t
want
to.
I’m
afraid
of
what
might
be
waiting
for
me.
The
old
Kings
of
Winter
are
down
there,
sitting
on
their
thrones
with
stone
wolves
at
their
feet
and
iron
swords
across
their
laps,
but
it’s
not
them
I’m
afraid
of.
I
scream
that
I’m
not
a
Stark,
that
this
isn’t
my
place,
but
it’s
no
good,
I
have
to
go
anyway,
so
I
start
down,
feeling
the
walls
as
I
descend,
with
no
torch
to
light
the
way.
It
gets
darker
and
darker,
until
I
want
to
scream.”
He
stopped,
frowning,
embarrassed.
“That’s
when
I
always
wake.”
His
skin
cold
and
clammy,
shivering
in
the
darkness
of
his
cell.
Ghost
would
leap
up
beside
him,
his
warmth
as
comforting
as
daybreak.
He
would
go
back
to
sleep
with
his
face
pressed
into
the
direwolf
s
shaggy
white
fur.
“Do
you
dream
of
Horn
Hill?”
Jon
asked.

“No.”
Sam’s
mouth
grew
tight
and
hard.
“I
hated
it
there.”
He
scratched
Ghost
behind
the
ear,
brooding,
and
Jon
let
the
silence
breathe.
After
a
long
while
Samwell
Tarly
began
to
talk,
and
Jon
Snow
listened
quietly,
and
learned
how
it
was
that
a
self-confessed
coward
found
himself
on
the
Wall.

The
Tarlys
were
a
family
old
in
honor,
bannermen
to
Mace
Tyrell,
Lord
of
Highgarden
and
Warden
of
the
South.
The
eldest
son
of
Lord
Randyll
Tarly,
Samwell
was
born
heir
to
rich
lands,
a
strong
keep,
and
a
storied
two-handed
greatsword
named
Heartsbane,
forged
of
Valyrian
steel
and
passed
down
from
father
to
son
near
five
hundred
years.

Whatever
pride
his
lord
father
might
have
felt
at
Samwell’s
birth
vanished
as
the
boy
grew
up
plump,
soft,
and
awkward.
Sam
loved
to
listen
to
music
and
make
his
own
songs,
to
wear
soft
velvets,
to
play
in
the
castle
kitchen
beside
the
cooks,
drinking
in
the
rich
smells
as
he
snitched
lemon
cakes
and
blueberry
tarts.
His
passions
were
books
and
kittens
and
dancing,
clumsy
as
he
was.
But
he
grew
ill
at
the
sight
of
blood,
and
wept
to
see
even
a
chicken
slaughtered.
A
dozen
masters-at-arms
came
and
went
at
Horn
Hill,
trying
to
turn
Samwell
into
the
knight
his
father
wanted.
The
boy
was
cursed
and
caned,
slapped
and
starved.
One
man
had
him
sleep
in
his
chainmail
to
make
him
more
martial.
Another
dressed
him
in
his
mother’s
clothing
and
paraded
him
through
the
bailey
to
shame
him
into
valor.
He
only
grew
fatter
and
more
frightened,
until
Lord
Randyll’s
disappointment
turned
to
anger
and
then
to
loathing.
“One
time,”
Sam
confided,
his
voice
dropping
from
a
whisper,
“two
men
came
to
the
castle,
warlocks
from
Qarth
with
white
skin
and
blue
lips.
They
slaughtered
a
bull
aurochs
and
made
me
bathe
in
the
hot
blood,
but
it
didn’t
make
me
brave
as
they’d
promised.
I
got
sick
and
retched.
Father
had
them
scourged.”

Finally,
after
three
girls
in
as
many
years,
Lady
Tarly
gave
her
lord
husband
a
second
son.
From
that
day,
Lord
Randyll
ignored
Sam,
devoting
all
his
time
to
the
younger
boy,
a
fierce,
robust
child
more
to
his
liking.
Samwell
had
known
several
years
of
sweet
peace
with
his
music
and
his
books.

Until
the
dawn
of
his
fifteenth
name
day,
when
he
had
been
awakened
to
find
his
horse
saddled
and
ready.
Three
men-at-arms
had
escorted
him
into
a
wood
near
Horn
Hill,
where
his
father
was
skinning
a
deer.
“You
are
almost
a
man
grown
now,
and
my
heir,”
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
had
told
his
eldest
son,
his
long
knife
laying
bare
the
carcass
as
he
spoke.
“You
have
given
me
no
cause
to
disown
you,
but
neither
will
I
allow
you
to
inherit
the
land
and
title
that
should
be
Dickon’s.
Heartsbane
must
go
to
a
man
strong
enough
to
wield
her,
and
you
are
not
worthy
to
touch
her
hilt.
So
I
have
decided
that
you
shall
this
day
announce
that
you
wish
to
take
the
black.
You
will
forsake
all
claim
to
your
brother’s
inheritance
and
start
north
before
evenfall.

“If
you
do
not,
then
on
the
morrow
we
shall
have
a
hunt,
and
somewhere
in
these
woods
your
horse
will
stumble,
and
you
will
be
thrown
from
the
saddle
to
die…
or
so
I
will
tell
your
mother.
She
has
a
woman’s
heart
and
finds
it
in
her
to
cherish
even
you,
and
I
have
no
wish
to
cause
her
pain.
Please
do
not
imagine
that
it
will
truly
be
that
easy,
should
you
think
to
defy
me.
Nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
hunt
you
down
like
the
pig
you
are.”
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow
as
he
laid
the
skinning
knife
aside.
“So.
There
is
your
choice.
The
Night’s
Watch”—he
reached
inside
the
deer,
ripped
out
its
heart,
and
held
it
in
his
fist,
red
and
dripping—“or
this.”

Sam
told
the
tale
in
a
calm,
dead
voice,
as
if
it
were
something
that
had
happened
to
someone
else,
not
to
him.
And
strangely,
Jon
thought,
he
did
not
weep,
not
even
once.
When
he
was
done,
they
sat
together
and
listened
to
the
wind
for
a
time.
There
was
no
other
sound
in
all
the
world.

Finally
Jon
said,
“We
should
go
back
to
the
common
hall.”

“Why?”
Sam
asked.

Jon
shrugged.
“There’s
hot
cider
to
drink,
or
mulled
wine
if
you
prefer.
Some
nights
Dareon
sings
for
us,
if
the
mood
is
on
him.
He
was
a
singer,
before…
well,
not
truly,
but
almost,
an
apprentice
singer.”

“How
did
he
come
here?”
Sam
asked.

“Lord
Rowan
of
Goldengrove
found
him
in
bed
with
his
daughter.
The
girl
was
two
years
older,
and
Dareon
swears
she
helped
him
through
her
window,
but
under
her
father’s
eye
she
named
it
rape,
so
here
he
is.
When
Maester
Aemon
heard
him
sing,
he
said
his
voice
was
honey
poured
over
thunder.”
Jon
smiled.
“Toad
sometimes
sings
too,
if
you
call
it
singing.
Drinking
songs
he
learned
in
his
father’s
winesink.
Pyp
says
his
voice
is
piss
poured
over
a
fart.”
They
laughed
at
that
together.

“I
should
like
to
hear
them
both,”
Sam
admitted,
“but
they
would
not
want
me
there.”
His
face
was
troubled.
“He’s
going
to
make
me
fight
again
on
the
morrow,
isn’t
he?”

“He
is,”
Jon
was
forced
to
say.

Sam
got
awkwardly
to
his
feet.
“I
had
better
try
to
sleep.”
He
huddled
down
in
his
cloak
and
plodded
off.

The
others
were
still
in
the
common
room
when
Jon
returned,
alone
but
for
Ghost.
“Where
have
you
been?”
Pyp
asked.

“Talking
with
Sam,”
he
said.

“He
truly
is
craven,”
said
Grenn.
“At
supper,
there
were
still
places
on
the
bench
when
he
got
his
pie,
but
he
was
too
scared
to
come
sit
with
us.”

“The
Lord
of
Ham
thinks
he’s
too
good
to
eat
with
the
likes
of
us,”
suggested
Jeren.

“I
saw
him
eat
a
pork
pie,”
Toad
said,
smirking.
“Do
you
think
it
was
a
brother?”
He
began
to
make
oinking
noises.

“Stop
it!”
Jon
snapped
angrily.

The
other
boys
fell
silent,
taken
aback
by
his
sudden
fury.
“Listen
to
me,”
Jon
said
into
the
quiet,
and
he
told
them
how
it
was
going
to
be.
Pyp
backed
him,
as
he’d
known
he
would,
but
when
Halder
spoke
up,
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise.
Grenn
was
anxious
at
the
first,
but
Jon
knew
the
words
to
move
him.
One
by
one
the
rest
fell
in
line.
Jon
persuaded
some,
cajoled
some,
shamed
the
others,
made
threats
where
threats
were
required.
At
the
end
they
had
all
agreed…
all
but
Rast.

“You
girls
do
as
you
please,”
Rast
said,
“but
if
Thorne
sends
me
against
Lady
Piggy,
I’m
going
to
slice
me
off
a
rasher
of
bacon.”
He
laughed
in
Jon’s
face
and
left
them
there.

Hours
later,
as
the
castle
slept,
three
of
them
paid
a
call
on
his
cell.
Grenn
held
his
arms
while
Pyp
sat
on
his
legs.
Jon
could
hear
Rast’s
rapid
breathing
as
Ghost
leapt
onto
his
chest.
The
direwolf’s
eyes
burned
red
as
embers
as
his
teeth
nipped
lightly
at
the
soft
skin
of
the
boy’s
throat,
just
enough
to
draw
blood.
“Remember,
we
know
where
you
sleep,”
Jon
said
softly.

The
next
morning
Jon
heard
Rast
tell
Albett
and
Toad
how
his
razor
had
slipped
while
he
shaved.

From
that
day
forth,
neither
Rast
nor
any
of
the
others
would
hurt
Samwell
Tarly.
When
Ser
Alliser
matched
them
against
him,
they
would
stand
their
ground
and
swat
aside
his
slow,
clumsy
strokes.
If
the
master-at-arms
screamed
for
an
attack,
they
would
dance
in
and
tap
Sam
lightly
on
breastplate
or
helm
or
leg.
Ser
Alliser
raged
and
threatened
and
called
them
all
cravens
and
women
and
worse,
yet
Sam
remained
unhurt.
A
few
nights
later,
at
Jon’s
urging,
he
joined
them
for
the
evening
meal,
taking
a
place
on
the
bench
beside
Halder.
It
was
another
fortnight
before
he
found
the
nerve
to
join
their
talk,
but
in
time
he
was
laughing
at
Pyp’s
faces
and
teasing
Grenn
with
the
best
of
them.

Fat
and
awkward
and
frightened
he
might
be,
but
Samwell
Tarly
was
no
fool.
One
night
he
visited
Jon
in
his
cell.
“I
don’t
know
what
you
did,”
he
said,
“but
I
know
you
did
it.”
He
looked
away
shyly.
“I’ve
never
had
a
friend
before.”

“We’re
not
friends,”
Jon
said.
He
put
a
hand
on
Sam’s
broad
shoulder.
“We’re
brothers.”

And
so
they
were,
he
thought
to
himself
after
Sam
had
taken
his
leave.
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon
were
his
father’s
sons,
and
he
loved
them
still,
yet
Jon
knew
that
he
had
never
truly
been
one
of
them.
Catelyn
Stark
had
seen
to
that.
The
grey
walls
of
Winterfell
might
still
haunt
his
dreams,
but
Castle
Black
was
his
life
now,
and
his
brothers
were
Sam
and
Grenn
and
Halder
and
Pyp
and
the
other
cast-outs
who
wore
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch.

“My
uncle
spoke
truly,”
he
whispered
to
Ghost.
He
wondered
if
he
would
ever
see
Benjen
Stark
again,
to
tell
him.





EDDARD

“It’s
the
hand’s
tourney
that’s
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble,
my
lords,”
the
commander
of
the
city
watch
complained
to
the
king’s
council.

“The
king’s
tourney,”
Ned
corrected,
wincing.
“I
assure
you,
the
Hand
wants
no
part
of
it.”

“Call
it
what
you
will,
my
lord.
Knights
have
been
arriving
from
all
over
the
realm,
and
for
every
knight
we
get
two
freeriders,
three
craftsmen,
six
men-at-arms,
a
dozen
merchants,
two
dozen
whores,
and
more
thieves
than
I
dare
guess.
This
cursed
heat
had
half
the
city
in
a
fever
to
start,
and
now
with
all
these
visitors…
last
night
we
had
a
drowning,
a
tavern
riot,
three
knife
fights,
a
rape,
two
fires,
robberies
beyond
count,
and
a
drunken
horse
race
down
the
Street
of
the
Sisters.
The
night
before
a
woman’s
head
was
found
in
the
Great
Sept,
floating
in
the
rainbow
pool.
No
one
seems
to
know
how
it
got
there
or
who
it
belongs
to.”

“How
dreadful,”
Varys
said
with
a
shudder.

Lord
Renly
Baratheon
was
less
sympathetic.
“If
you
cannot
keep
the
king’s
peace,
Janos,
perhaps
the
City
Watch
should
be
commanded
by
someone
who
can.”

Stout,
jowly
Janos
Slynt
puffed
himself
up
like
an
angry
frog,
his
bald
pate
reddening.
“Aegon
the
Dragon
himself
could
not
keep
the
peace,
Lord
Renly.
I
need
more
men.”

“How
many?”
Ned
asked,
leaning
forward.
As
ever,
Robert
had
not
troubled
himself
to
attend
the
council
session,
so
it
fell
to
his
Hand
to
speak
for
him.

“As
many
as
can
be
gotten,
Lord
Hand.”

“Hire
fifty
new
men,”
Ned
told
him.
“Lord
Baelish
will
see
that
you
get
the
coin.”

“I
will?”
Littlefinger
said.

“You
will.
You
found
forty
thousand
golden
dragons
for
a
champion’s
purse,
surely
you
can
scrape
together
a
few
coppers
to
keep
the
king’s
peace.”
Ned
turned
back
to
Janos
Slynt.
“I
will
also
give
you
twenty
good
swords
from
my
own
household
guard,
to
serve
with
the
Watch
until
the
crowds
have
left.”

“All
thanks,
Lord
Hand,”
Slynt
said,
bowing.
“I
promise
you,
they
shall
be
put
to
good
use.”

When
the
Commander
had
taken
his
leave,
Eddard
Stark
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
council.
“The
sooner
this
folly
is
done
with,
the
better
I
shall
like
it.”
As
if
the
expense
and
trouble
were
not
irksome
enough,
all
and
sundry
insisted
on
salting
Ned’s
wound
by
calling
it
“the
Hand’s
tourney,”
as
if
he
were
the
cause
of
it.
And
Robert
honestly
seemed
to
think
he
should
feel
honored!

“The
realm
prospers
from
such
events,
my
lord,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“They
bring
the
great
the
chance
of
glory,
and
the
lowly
a
respite
from
their
woes.”

“And
put
coins
in
many
a
pocket,”
Littlefinger
added.
“Every
inn
in
the
city
is
full,
and
the
whores
are
walking
bowlegged
and
jingling
with
each
step.”

Lord
Renly
laughed.
“We’re
fortunate
my
brother
Stannis
is
not
with
us.
Remember
the
time
he
proposed
to
outlaw
brothels?
The
king
asked
him
if
perhaps
he’d
like
to
outlaw
eating,
shitting,
and
breathing
while
he
was
at
it.
If
truth
be
told,
I
ofttimes
wonder
how
Stannis
ever
got
that
ugly
daughter
of
his.
He
goes
to
his
marriage
bed
like
a
man
marching
to
a
battlefield,
with
a
grim
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
determination
to
do
his
duty.”

Ned
had
not
joined
the
laughter.
“I
wonder
about
your
brother
Stannis
as
well.
I
wonder
when
he
intends
to
end
his
visit
to
Dragonstone
and
resume
his
seat
on
this
council.”

“No
doubt
as
soon
as
we’ve
scourged
all
those
whores
into
the
sea,”
Littlefinger
replied,
provoking
more
laughter.

“I
have
heard
quite
enough
about
whores
for
one
day,”
Ned
said,
rising.
“Until
the
morrow.”

Harwin
had
the
door
when
Ned
returned
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“Summon
Jory
to
my
chambers
and
tell
your
father
to
saddle
my
horse,”
Ned
told
him,
too
brusquely.

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”

The
Red
Keep
and
the
“Hand’s
tourney”
were
chafing
him
raw,
Ned
reflected
as
he
climbed.
He
yearned
for
the
comfort
of
Catelyn’s
arms,
for
the
sounds
of
Robb
and
Jon
crossing
swords
in
the
practice
yard,
for
the
cool
days
and
cold
nights
of
the
north.

In
his
chambers
he
stripped
off
his
council
silks
and
sat
for
a
moment
with
the
book
while
he
waited
for
Jory
to
arrive.
The
Lineages
and
Histories
of
the
Great
Houses
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
With
Descliptions
of
Many
High
Lords
and
Noble
Ladies
and
Their
Children,
by
Grand
Maester
Malleon.
Pycelle
had
spoken
truly;
it
made
for
ponderous
reading.
Yet
Jon
Arryn
had
asked
for
it,
and
Ned
felt
certain
he
had
reasons.
There
was
something
here,
some
truth
buried
in
these
brittle
yellow
pages,
if
only
he
could
see
it.
But
what?
The
tome
was
over
a
century
old.
Scarcely
a
man
now
alive
had
yet
been
born
when
Malleon
had
compiled
his
dusty
lists
of
weddings,
births,
and
deaths.

He
opened
to
the
section
on
House
Lannister
once
more,
and
turned
the
pages
slowly,
hoping
against
hope
that
something
would
leap
out
at
him.
The
Lannisters
were
an
old
family,
tracing
their
descent
back
to
Lann
the
Clever,
a
trickster
from
the
Age
of
Heroes
who
was
no
doubt
as
legendary
as
Bran
the
Builder,
though
far
more
beloved
of
singers
and
taletellers.
In
the
songs,
Lann
was
the
fellow
who
winkled
the
Casterlys
out
of
Casterly
Rock
with
no
weapon
but
his
wits,
and
stole
gold
from
the
sun
to
brighten
his
curly
hair.
Ned
wished
he
were
here
now,
to
winkle
the
truth
out
of
this
damnable
book.

A
sharp
rap
on
the
door
heralded
Jory
Cassel.
Ned
closed
Malleon’s
tome
and
bid
him
enter.
“I’ve
promised
the
City
Watch
twenty
of
my
guard
until
the
tourney
is
done,”
he
told
him.
“I
rely
on
you
to
make
the
choice.
Give
Alyn
the
command,
and
make
certain
the
men
understand
that
they
are
needed
to
stop
fights,
not
start
them.”
Rising,
Ned
opened
a
cedar
chest
and
removed
a
light
linen
undertunic.
“Did
you
find
the
stableboy?”

“The
watchman,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.
“He
vows
he’ll
never
touch
another
horse.”

“What
did
he
have
to
say?”

“He
claims
he
knew
Lord
Arryn
well.
Fast
friends,
they
were.”
Jory
snorted.
“The
Hand
always
gave
the
lads
a
copper
on
their
name
days,
he
says.
Had
a
way
with
horses.
Never
rode
his
mounts
too
hard,
and
brought
them
carrots
and
apples,
so
they
were
always
pleased
to
see
him.”

“Carrots
and
apples,”
Ned
repeated.
It
sounded
as
if
this
boy
would
be
even
less
use
than
the
others.
And
he
was
the
last
of
the
four
Littlefinger
had
turned
up.
Jory
had
spoken
to
each
of
them
in
turn.
Ser
Hugh
had
been
brusque
and
uninformative,
and
arrogant
as
only
a
new-made
knight
can
be.
If
the
Hand
wished
to
talk
to
him,
he
should
be
pleased
to
receive
him,
but
he
would
not
be
questioned
by
a
mere
captain
of
guards…
even
if
said
captain
was
ten
years
older
and
a
hundred
times
the
swordsman.
The
serving
girl
had
at
least
been
pleasant.
She
said
Lord
Jon
had
been
reading
more
than
was
good
for
him,
that
he
was
troubled
and
melancholy
over
his
young
son’s
frailty,
and
gruff
with
his
lady
wife.
The
potboy,
now
cordwainer,
had
never
exchanged
so
much
as
a
word
with
Lord
Jon,
but
he
was
full
of
oddments
of
kitchen
gossip:
the
lord
had
been
quarreling
with
the
king,
the
lord
only
picked
at
his
food,
the
lord
was
sending
his
boy
to
be
fostered
on
Dragonstone,
the
lord
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
the
breeding
of
hunting
hounds,
the
lord
had
visited
a
master
armorer
to
commission
a
new
suit
of
plate,
wrought
all
in
pale
silver
with
a
blue
jasper
falcon
and
a
mother-of-pearl
moon
on
the
breast.
The
king’s
own
brother
had
gone
with
him
to
help
choose
the
design,
the
potboy
said.
No,
not
Lord
Renly,
the
other
one,
Lord
Stannis.

“Did
our
watchman
recall
anything
else
of
note?”

“The
lad
swears
Lord
Jon
was
as
strong
as
a
man
half
his
age.
Often
went
riding
with
Lord
Stannis,
he
says.”

Stannis
again,
Ned
thought.
He
found
that
curious.
Jon
Arryn
and
he
had
been
cordial,
but
never
friendly.
And
while
Robert
had
been
riding
north
to
Winterfell,
Stannis
had
removed
himself
to
Dragonstone,
the
Targaryen
island
fastness
he
had
conquered
in
his
brother’s
name.
He
had
given
no
word
as
to
when
he
might
return.
“Where
did
they
go
on
these
rides?”
Ned
asked.

“The
boy
says
that
they
visited
a
brothel.”

“A
brothel?”
Ned
said.
“The
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Hand
of
the
King
visited
a
brothel
with
Stannis
Baratheon?”
He
shook
his
head,
incredulous,
wondering
what
Lord
Renly
would
make
of
this
tidbit.
Robert’s
lusts
were
the
subject
of
ribald
drinking
songs
throughout
the
realm,
but
Stannis
was
a
different
sort
of
man;
a
bare
year
younger
than
the
king,
yet
utterly
unlike
him,
stern,
humorless,
unforgiving,
grim
in
his
sense
of
duty.

“The
boy
insists
it’s
true.
The
Hand
took
three
guardsmen
with
him,
and
the
boy
says
they
were
joking
of
it
when
he
took
their
horses
afterward.”

“Which
brothel?”
Ned
asked.

“The
boy
did
not
know.
The
guards
would.”

“A
pity
Lysa
carried
them
off
to
the
Vale,”
Ned
said
dryly.
“The
gods
are
doing
their
best
to
vex
us.
Lady
Lysa,
Maester
Colemon,
Lord
Stannis…
everyone
who
might
actually
know
the
truth
of
what
happened
to
Jon
Arryn
is
a
thousand
leagues
away.”

“Will
you
summon
Lord
Stannis
back
from
Dragonstone?”

“Not
yet,”
Ned
said.
“Not
until
I
have
a
better
notion
of
what
this
is
all
about
and
where
he
stands.”
The
matter
nagged
at
him.
Why
did
Stannis
leave?
Had
he
played
some
part
in
Jon
Arryn’s
murder?
Or
was
he
afraid?
Ned
found
it
hard
to
imagine
what
could
frighten
Stannis
Baratheon,
who
had
once
held
Storm’s
End
through
a
year
of
siege,
surviving
on
rats
and
boot
leather
while
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
sat
outside
with
their
hosts,
banqueting
in
sight
of
his
walls.

“Bring
me
my
doublet,
if
you
would.
The
grey,
with
the
direwolf
sigil.
I
want
this
armorer
to
know
who
I
am.
It
might
make
him
more
forthcoming.”

Jory
went
to
the
wardrobe.
“Lord
Renly
is
brother
to
Lord
Stannis
as
well
as
the
king.”

“Yet
it
seems
that
he
was
not
invited
on
these
rides.”
Ned
was
not
sure
what
to
make
of
Renly,
with
all
his
friendly
ways
and
easy
smiles.
A
few
days
past,
he
had
taken
Ned
aside
to
show
him
an
exquisite
rose
gold
locklet.
Inside
was
a
miniature
painted
in
the
vivid
Myrish
style,
of
a
lovely
young
girl
with
doe’s
eyes
and
a
cascade
of
soft
brown
hair.
Renly
had
seemed
anxious
to
know
if
the
girl
reminded
him
of
anyone,
and
when
Ned
had
no
answer
but
a
shrug,
he
had
seemed
disappointed.
The
maid
was
Loras
Tyrell’s
sister
Margaery,
he’d
confessed,
but
there
were
those
who
said
she
looked
like
Lyanna.
“No,”
Ned
had
told
him,
bemused.
Could
it
be
that
Lord
Renly,
who
looked
so
like
a
young
Robert,
had
conceived
a
passion
for
a
girl
he
fancied
to
be
a
young
Lyanna?
That
struck
him
as
more
than
passing
queer.

Jory
held
out
the
doublet,
and
Ned
slid
his
hands
through
the
armholes.
“Perhaps
Lord
Stannis
will
return
for
Robert’s
tourney,”
he
said
as
Jory
laced
the
garment
up
the
back.

“That
would
be
a
stroke
of
fortune,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.

Ned
buckled
on
a
longsword.
“In
other
words,
not
bloody
likely.”
His
smile
was
grim.

Jory
draped
Ned’s
cloak
across
his
shoulders
and
clasped
it
at
the
throat
with
the
Hand’s
badge
of
office.
“The
armorer
lives
above
his
shop,
in
a
large
house
at
the
top
of
the
Street
of
Steel.
Alyn
knows
the
way,
my
lord.”

Ned
nodded.
“The
gods
help
this
potboy
if
he’s
sent
me
off
haring
after
shadows.”
It
was
a
slim
enough
staff
to
lean
on,
but
the
Jon
Arryn
that
Ned
Stark
had
known
was
not
one
to
wear
jeweled
and
silvered
plate.
Steel
was
steel;
it
was
meant
for
protection,
not
ornament.
He
might
have
changed
his
views,
to
be
sure.
He
would
scarcely
have
been
the
first
man
who
came
to
look
on
things
differently
after
a
few
years
at
court…
but
the
change
was
marked
enough
to
make
Ned
wonder.

“Is
there
any
other
service
I
might
perform?”

“I
suppose
you’d
best
begin
visiting
whorehouses.”

“Hard
duty,
my
lord.”
Jory
grinned.
“The
men
will
be
glad
to
help.
Porther
has
made
a
fair
start
already.”

Ned’s
favorite
horse
was
saddled
and
waiting
in
the
yard.
Varly
and
Jacks
fell
in
beside
him
as
he
rode
through
the
yard.
Their
steel
caps
and
shirts
of
mail
must
have
been
sweltering,
yet
they
said
no
word
of
complaint.
As
Lord
Eddard
passed
beneath
the
King’s
Gate
into
the
stink
of
the
city,
his
grey
and
white
cloak
streaming
from
his
shoulders,
he
saw
eyes
everywhere
and
kicked
his
mount
into
a
trot.
His
guard
followed.

He
looked
behind
him
frequently
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
crowded
city
streets.
Tomard
and
Desmond
had
left
the
castle
early
this
morning
to
take
up
positions
on
the
route
they
must
take,
and
watch
for
anyone
following
them,
but
even
so,
Ned
was
uncertain.
The
shadow
of
the
King’s
Spider
and
his
little
birds
had
him
fretting
like
a
maiden
on
her
wedding
night.

The
Street
of
Steel
began
at
the
market
square
beside
the
River
Gate,
as
it
was
named
on
maps,
or
the
Mud
Gate,
as
it
was
commonly
called.
A
mummer
on
stilts
was
striding
through
the
throngs
like
some
great
insect,
with
a
horde
of
barefoot
children
trailing
behind
him,
hooting.
Elsewhere,
two
ragged
boys
no
older
than
Bran
were
dueling
with
sticks,
to
the
loud
encouragement
of
some
and
the
furious
curses
of
others.
An
old
woman
ended
the
contest
by
leaning
out
of
her
window
and
emptying
a
bucket
of
slops
on
the
heads
of
the
combatants.
In
the
shadow
of
the
wall,
farmers
stood
beside
their
wagons,
bellowing
out,
“Apples,
the
best
apples,
cheap
at
twice
the
price,”
and
“Blood
melons,
sweet
as
honey,”
and
“Turnips,
onions,
roots,
here
you
go
here,
here
you
go,
turnips,
onions,
roots,
here
you
go
here.”

The
Mud
Gate
was
open,
and
a
squad
of
City
Watchmen
stood
under
the
portcullis
in
their
golden
cloaks,
leaning
on
spears.
When
a
column
of
riders
appeared
from
the
west,
the
guardsmen
sprang
into
action,
shouting
commands
and
moving
the
carts
and
foot
traffic
aside
to
let
the
knight
enter
with
his
escort.
The
first
rider
through
the
gate
carried
a
long
black
banner.
The
silk
rippled
in
the
wind
like
a
living
thing;
across
the
fabric
was
blazoned
a
night
sky
slashed
with
purple
lightning.
“Make
way
for
Lord
Beric!”
the
rider
shouted.
“Make
way
for
Lord
Beric!”
And
close
behind
came
the
young
lord
himself,
a
dashing
figure
on
a
black
courser,
with
red-gold
hair
and
a
black
satin
cloak
dusted
with
stars.
“Here
to
fight
in
the
Hand’s
tourney,
my
lord?”
a
guardsman
called
out
to
him.
“Here
to
win
the
Hand’s
tourney,”
Lord
Beric
shouted
back
as
the
crowd
cheered.

Ned
turned
off
the
square
where
the
Street
of
Steel
began
and
followed
its
winding
path
up
a
long
hill,
past
blacksmiths
working
at
open
forges,
freeriders
haggling
over
mail
shirts,
and
grizzled
ironmongers
selling
old
blades
and
razors
from
their
wagons.
The
farther
they
climbed,
the
larger
the
buildings
grew.
The
man
they
wanted
was
all
the
way
at
the
top
of
the
hill,
in
a
huge
house
of
timber
and
plaster
whose
upper
stories
loomed
over
the
narrow
street.
The
double
doors
showed
a
hunting
scene
carved
in
ebony
and
weirwood.
A
pair
of
stone
knights
stood
sentry
at
the
entrance,
armored
in
fanciful
suits
of
polished
red
steel
that
transformed
them
into
griffin
and
unicorn.
Ned
left
his
horse
with
Jacks
and
shouldered
his
way
inside.

The
slim
young
serving
girl
took
quick
note
of
Ned’s
badge
and
the
sigil
on
his
doublet,
and
the
master
came
hurrying
out,
all
smiles
and
bows.
“Wine
for
the
King’s
Hand,”
he
told
the
girl,
gesturing
Ned
to
a
couch.
“I
am
Tobho
Mott,
my
lord,
please,
please,
put
yourself
at
ease.”
He
wore
a
black
velvet
coat
with
hammers
embroidered
on
the
sleeves
in
silver
thread,
Around
his
neck
was
a
heavy
silver
chain
and
a
sapphire
as
large
as
a
pigeon’s
egg.
“If
you
are
in
need
of
new
arms
for
the
Hand’s
tourney,
you
have
come
to
the
right
shop.”
Ned
did
not
bother
to
correct
him.
“My
work
is
costly,
and
I
make
no
apologies
for
that,
my
lord,”
he
said
as
he
filled
two
matching
silver
goblets.
“You
will
not
find
craftsmanship
equal
to
mine
anywhere
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
I
promise
you.
Visit
every
forge
in
King’s
Landing
if
you
like,
and
compare
for
yourself.
Any
village
smith
can
hammer
out
a
shirt
of
mail;
my
work
is
art.”

Ned
sipped
his
wine
and
let
the
man
go
on.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
bought
all
his
armor
here,
Tobho
boasted,
and
many
high
lords,
the
ones
who
knew
fine
steel,
and
even
Lord
Renly,
the
king’s
own
brother.
Perhaps
the
Hand
had
seen
Lord
Renly’s
new
armor,
the
green
plate
with
the
golden
antlers?
No
other
armorer
in
the
city
could
get
that
deep
a
green;
he
knew
the
secret
of
putting
color
in
the
steel
itself,
paint
and
enamel
were
the
crutches
of
a
journeyman.
Or
mayhaps
the
Hand
wanted
a
blade?
Tobho
had
learned
to
work
Valyrian
steel
at
the
forges
of
Qohor
as
a
boy.
Only
a
man
who
knew
the
spells
could
take
old
weapons
and
forge
them
anew.
“The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
House
Stark,
is
it
not?
I
could
fashion
a
direwolf
helm
so
real
that
children
will
run
from
you
in
the
street,”
he
vowed.

Ned
smiled.
“Did
you
make
a
falcon
helm
for
Lord
Arryn?”

Tobho
Mott
paused
a
long
moment
and
set
aside
his
wine.
“The
Hand
did
call
upon
me,
with
Lord
Stannis,
the
king’s
brother.
I
regret
to
say,
they
did
not
honor
me
with
their
patronage.”

Ned
looked
at
the
man
evenly,
saying
nothing,
waiting.
He
had
found
over
the
years
that
silence
sometimes
yielded
more
than
questions.
And
so
it
was
this
time.

“They
asked
to
see
the
boy,”
the
armorer
said,
“so
I
took
them
back
to
the
forge.”

“The
boy,”
Ned
echoed.
He
had
no
notion
who
the
boy
might
be.
“I
should
like
to
see
the
boy
as
well.”

Tobho
Mott
gave
him
a
cool,
careful
look.
“As
you
wish,
my
lord,”
he
said
with
no
trace
of
his
former
friendliness.
He
led
Ned
out
a
rear
door
and
across
a
narrow
yard,
back
to
the
cavernous
stone
barn
where
the
work
was
done.
When
the
armorer
opened
the
door,
the
blast
of
hot
air
that
came
through
made
Ned
feel
as
though
he
were
walking
into
a
dragon’s
mouth.
Inside,
a
forge
blazed
in
each
corner,
and
the
air
stank
of
smoke
and
sulfur.
Journeymen
armorers
glanced
up
from
their
hammers
and
tongs
just
long
enough
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
their
brows,
while
bare-chested
apprentice
boys
worked
the
bellows.

The
master
called
over
a
tall
lad
about
Robb’s
age,
his
arms
and
chest
corded
with
muscle.
“This
is
Lord
Stark,
the
new
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
told
him
as
the
boy
looked
at
Ned
through
sullen
blue
eyes
and
pushed
back
sweat-soaked
hair
with
his
fingers.
Thick
hair,
shaggy
and
unkempt
and
black
as
ink.
The
shadow
of
a
new
beard
darkened
his
jaw.
“This
is
Gendry.
Strong
for
his
age,
and
he
works
hard.
Show
the
Hand
that
helmet
you
made,
lad.”
Almost
shyly,
the
boy
led
them
to
his
bench,
and
a
steel
helm
shaped
like
a
bull’s
head,
with
two
great
curving
horns.

Ned
turned
the
helm
over
in
his
hands.
It
was
raw
steel,
unpolished
but
expertly
shaped.
“This
is
fine
work.
I
would
be
pleased
if
you
would
let
me
buy
it.”

The
boy
snatched
it
out
of
his
hands.
“It’s
not
for
sale.”

Tobho
Mott
looked
horror-struck.
“Boy,
this
is
the
King’s
Hand.
If
his
lordship
wants
this
helm,
make
him
a
gift
of
it.
He
honors
you
by
asking.”

“I
made
it
for
me,”
the
boy
said
stubbornly.

“A
hundred
pardons,
my
lord,”
his
master
said
hurriedly
to
Ned.
“The
boy
is
crude
as
new
steel,
and
like
new
steel
would
profit
from
some
beating.
That
helm
is
journeyman’s
work
at
best.
Forgive
him
and
I
promise
I
will
craft
you
a
helm
like
none
you
have
ever
seen.”

“He’s
done
nothing
that
requires
my
forgiveness.
Gendry,
when
Lord
Arryn
came
to
see
you,
what
did
you
talk
about?”

“He
asked
me
questions
is
all,
m’lord.”

“What
sort
of
questions?”

The
boy
shrugged.
“How
was
I,
and
was
I
well
treated,
and
if
I
liked
the
work,
and
stuff
about
my
mother.
Who
she
was
and
what
she
looked
like
and
all.”

“What
did
you
tell
him?”
Ned
asked.

The
boy
shoved
a
fresh
fall
of
black
hair
off
his
forehead.
“She
died
when
I
was
little.
She
had
yellow
hair,
and
sometimes
she
used
to
sing
to
me,
I
remember.
She
worked
in
an
alehouse.”

“Did
Lord
Stannis
question
you
as
well?”

“The
bald
one?
No,
not
him.
He
never
said
no
word,
just
glared
at
me,
like
I
was
some
raper
who
done
for
his
daughter.”

“Mind
your
filthy
tongue,”
the
master
said.
“This
is
the
King’s
own
Hand.”
The
boy
lowered
his
eyes.
“A
smart
boy,
but
stubborn.
That
helm…
the
others
call
him
bullheaded,
so
he
threw
it
in
their
teeth.”

Ned
touched
the
boy’s
head,
fingering
the
thick
black
hair.
“Look
at
me,
Gendry.”
The
apprentice
lifted
his
face.
Ned
studied
the
shape
of
his
jaw,
the
eyes
like
blue
ice.
Yes,
he
thought,
I
see
it.
“Go
back
to
your
work,
lad.
I’m
sorry
to
have
bothered
you.”
He
walked
back
to
the
house
with
the
master.
“Who
paid
the
boy’s
apprentice
fee?”
he
asked
lightly.

Mott
looked
fretful.
“You
saw
the
boy.
Such
a
strong
boy.
Those
hands
of
his,
those
hands
were
made
for
hammers.
He
had
such
promise,
I
took
him
on
without
a
fee.”

“The
truth
now,”
Ned
urged.
“The
streets
are
full
of
strong
boys.
The
day
you
take
on
an
apprentice
without
a
fee
will
be
the
day
the
Wall
comes
down.
Who
paid
for
him?”

“A
lord,”
the
master
said
reluctantly.
“He
gave
no
name,
and
wore
no
sigil
on
his
coat.
He
paid
in
gold,
twice
the
customary
sum,
and
said
he
was
paying
once
for
the
boy,
and
once
for
my
silence.”

“Describe
him.”

“He
was
stout,
round
of
shoulder,
not
so
tall
as
you.
Brown
beard,
but
there
was
a
bit
of
red
in
it,
I’ll
swear.
He
wore
a
rich
cloak,
that
I
do
remember,
heavy
purple
velvet
worked
with
silver
threads,
but
the
hood
shadowed
his
face
and
I
never
did
see
him
clear.”
He
hesitated
a
moment.
“My
lord,
I
want
no
trouble.”

“None
of
us
wants
trouble,
but
I
fear
these
are
troubled
times,
Master
Mott,”
Ned
said.
“You
know
who
the
boy
is.”

“I
am
only
an
armorer,
my
lord.
I
know
what
I’m
told.”

“You
know
who
the
boy
is,”
Ned
repeated
patiently.
“That
is
not
a
question.”

“The
boy
is
my
apprentice,”
the
master
said.
He
looked
Ned
in
the
eye,
stubborn
as
old
iron.
“Who
he
was
before
he
came
to
me,
that’s
none
of
my
concern.”

Ned
nodded.
He
decided
that
he
liked
Tobho
Mott,
master
armorer.
“If
the
day
ever
comes
when
Gendry
would
rather
wield
a
sword
than
forge
one,
send
him
to
me.
He
has
the
look
of
a
warrior.
Until
then,
you
have
my
thanks,
Master
Mott,
and
my
promise.
Should
I
ever
want
a
helm
to
frighten
children,
this
will
be
the
first
place
I
visit.”

His
guard
was
waiting
outside
with
the
horses.
“Did
you
find
anything,
my
lord?”
Jacks
asked
as
Ned
mounted
up.

“I
did,”
Ned
told
him,
wondering.
What
had
Jon
Arryn
wanted
with
a
king’s
bastard,
and
why
was
it
worth
his
life?

ARYA

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
Arya
would
tell
herself,
but
that
did
not
make
the
fear
go
away.
It
was
as
much
a
part
of
her
days
as
stale
bread
and
the
blisters
on
her
toes
after
a
long
day
of
walking
the
hard,
rutted
road.

She
had
thought
she
had
known
what
it
meant
to
be
afraid,
but
she
learned
better
in
that
storehouse
beside
the
Gods
Eye.
Eight
days
she
had
lingered
there
before
the
Mountain
gave
the
command
to
march,
and
every
day
she
had
seen
someone
die.

The
Mountain
would
come
into
the
storehouse
after
he
had
broken
his
fast
and
pick
one
of
the
prisoners
for
questioning.
The
village
folk
would
never
look
at
him.
Maybe
they
thought
that
if
they
did
not
notice
him,
he
would
not
notice
them…
but
he
saw
them
anyway
and
picked
whom
he
liked.
There
was
no
place
to
hide,
no
tricks
to
play,
no
way
to
be
safe.

One
girl
shared
a
soldier’s
bed
three
nights
running;
the
Mountain
picked
her
on
the
fourth
day,
and
the
soldier
said
nothing.

A
smiley
old
man
mended
their
clothing
and
babbled
about
his
son,
off
serving
in
the
gold
cloaks
at
King’s
Landing.
“A
king’s
man,
he
is,”
he
would
say,
“a
good
king’s
man
like
me,
all
for
Joffrey.”
He
said
it
so
often
the
other
captives
began
to
call
him
All-for-Joffrey
whenever
the
guards
weren’t
listening.
All-for-Joffrey
was
picked
on
the
fifth
day.

A
young
mother
with
a
pox-scarred
face
offered
to
freely
tell
them
all
she
knew
if
they’d
promise
not
to
hurt
her
daughter.
The
Mountain
heard
her
out;
the
next
morning
he
picked
her
daughter,
to
be
certain
she’d
held
nothing
back.

The
ones
chosen
were
questioned
in
full
view
of
the
other
captives,
so
they
could
see
the
fate
of
rebels
and
traitors.
A
man
the
others
called
the
Tickler
asked
the
questions.
His
face
was
so
ordinary
and
his
garb
so
plain
that
Arya
might
have
thought
him
one
of
the
villagers
before
=======
CATELYN

“My
lady,
you
ought
cover
your
head,”
Ser
Rodrik
told
her
as
their
horses
plodded
north.
“You
will
take
a
chill.”

“It
is
only
water,
Ser
Rodrik,”
Catelyn
replied.
Her
hair
hung
wet
and
heavy,
a
loose
strand
stuck
to
her
forehead,
and
she
could
imagine
how
ragged
and
wild
she
must
look,
but
for
once
she
did
not
care.
The
southern
rain
was
soft
and
warm.
Catelyn
liked
the
feel
of
it
on
her
face,
gentle
as
a
mother’s
kisses.
It
took
her
back
to
her
childhood,
to
long
grey
days
at
Riverrun.
She
remembered
the
godswood,
drooping
branches
heavy
with
moisture,
and
the
sound
of
her
brother’s
laughter
as
he
chased
her
through
piles
of
damp
leaves.
She
remembered
making
mud
pies
with
Lysa,
the
weight
of
them,
the
mud
slick
and
brown
between
her
fingers.
They
had
served
them
to
Littlefinger,
giggling,
and
he’d
eaten
so
much
mud
he
was
sick
for
a
week.
How
young
they
all
had
been.

Catelyn
had
almost
forgotten.
In
the
north,
the
rain
fell
cold
and
hard,
and
sometimes
at
night
it
turned
to
ice.
It
was
as
likely
to
kill
a
crop
as
nurture
it,
and
it
sent
grown
men
running
for
the
nearest
shelter.
That
was
no
rain
for
little
girls
to
play
in.

“I
am
soaked
through,”
Ser
Rodrik
complained.
“Even
my
bones
are
wet.”
The
woods
pressed
close
around
them,
and
the
steady
pattering
of
rain
on
leaves
was
accompanied
by
the
small
sucking
sounds
their
horses
made
as
their
hooves
pulled
free
of
the
mud.
“We
will
want
a
fire
tonight,
my
lady,
and
a
hot
meal
would
serve
us
both.”

“There
is
an
inn
at
the
crossroads
up
ahead,”
Catelyn
told
him.
She
had
slept
many
a
night
there
in
her
youth,
traveling
with
her
father.
Lord
Hoster
Tully
had
been
a
restless
man
in
his
prime,
always
riding
somewhere.
She
still
remembered
the
innkeep,
a
fat
woman
named
Masha
Heddle
who
chewed
sourleaf
night
and
day
and
seemed
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
smiles
and
sweet
cakes
for
the
children.
The
sweet
cakes
had
been
soaked
with
honey,
rich
and
heavy
on
the
tongue,
but
how
Catelyn
had
dreaded
those
smiles.
The
sourleaf
had
stained
Masha’s
teeth
a
dark
red,
and
made
her
smile
a
bloody
horror.

“An
inn,”
Ser
Rodrik
repeated
wistfully.
“If
only…
but
we
dare
not
risk
it.
If
we
wish
to
remain
unknown,
I
think
it
best
we
seek
out
some
small
holdfast…”
He
broke
off
as
they
heard
sounds
up
the
road;
splashing
water,
the
clink
of
mail,
a
horse’s
whinny.
“Riders,”
he
warned,
his
hand
dropping
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
Even
on
the
kingsroad,
it
never
hurt
to
be
wary.

They
followed
the
sounds
around
a
lazy
bend
of
the
road
and
saw
them;
a
column
of
armed
men
noisily
fording
a
swollen
stream.
Catelyn
reined
up
to
let
them
pass.
The
banner
in
the
hand
of
the
foremost
rider
hung
sodden
and
limp,
but
the
guardsmen
wore
indigo
cloaks
and
on
their
shoulders
flew
the
silver
eagle
of
Seagard.
“Mallisters,”
Ser
Rodrik
whispered
to
her,
as
if
she
had
not
known.
“My
lady,
best
pull
up
your
hood.”

Catelyn
made
no
move.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
himself
rode
with
them,
surrounded
by
his
knights,
his
son
Patrek
by
his
side
and
their
squires
close
behind.
They
were
riding
for
King’s
Landing
and
the
Hand’s
tourney,
she
knew.
For
the
past
week,
the
travelers
had
been
thick
as
flies
upon
the
kingsroad;
knights
and
freeriders,
singers
with
their
harps
and
drums,
heavy
wagons
laden
with
hops
or
corn
or
casks
of
honey,
traders
and
craftsmen
and
whores,
and
all
of
them
moving
south.

She
studied
Lord
Jason
boldly.
The
last
time
>>>>>>> asd
she
had
seen
him
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
at
his
work.
“Tickler
makes
them
howl
so
hard
they
piss
themselves,”
old
stoop-shoulder
Chiswyck
told
them.
He
was
the
man
she’d
tried
to
bite,
who’d
called
her
a
fierce
little
thing
and
smashed
her
head
with
a
mailed
fist.
Sometimes
he
helped
the
Tickler.
Sometimes
others
did
that.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
himself
would
stand
motionless,
watching
and
listening,
until
the
victim
died.

The
questions
were
always
the
same.
Was
there
gold
hidden
in
the
village?
Silver,
gems?
Was
there
more
food?
Where
was
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion?
Which
of
the
village
folk
had
aided
him?
When
he
rode
off,
where
did
he
go?
How
many
men
were
with
them?
How
many
knights,
how
many
bowmen,
how
many
men-at-arms?
How
were
they
armed?
How
many
were
horsed?
How
many
were
wounded?
What
other
enemy
had
they
seen?
How
many?
When?
What
banners
did
they
fly?
Where
did
they
go?
Was
there
gold
hidden
in
the
village?
Silver,
gems?
Where
was
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion?
How
many
men
were
with
him?
By
the
third
day,
Arya
could
have
asked
the
questions
herself.

They
found
a
little
gold,
a
little
silver,
a
great
sack
of
copper
pennies,
and
a
dented
goblet
set
with
garnets
that
two
soldiers
almost
came
to
blows
over.
They
learned
that
Lord
Beric
had
ten
starvelings
with
him,
or
else
a
hundred
mounted
knights;
that
he
had
ridden
west,
or
north,
or
south;
that
he
had
crossed
the
lake
in
a
boat;
that
he
was
strong
as
an
aurochs
or
weak
from
the
bloody
flux.
No
one
ever
survived
the
Tickler’s
questioning;
no
man,
no
woman,
no
child.
The
strongest
lasted
past
evenfall.
Their
bodies
were
hung
beyond
the
fires
for
the
wolves.

By
the
time
they
marched,
Arya
knew
she
was
no
water
dancer.
Syrio
Forel
would
never
have
let
them
knock
him
down
and
take
his
sword
away,
nor
stood
by
when
they
killed
Lommy
Greenhands.
Syrio
would
never
have
sat
silent
in
that
storehouse
nor
shuffled
along
meekly
among
the
other
captives.
The
direwolf
was
the
sigil
of
the
Starks,
but
Arya
felt
more
a
lamb,
surrounded
by
a
herd
of
other
sheep.
She
hated
the
villagers
for
their
sheepishness,
almost
as
much
as
she
hated
herself.

The
Lannisters
had
taken
everything:
father,
friends,
home,
hope,
courage.
One
had
taken
Needle,
while
another
had
broken
her
wooden
stick
sword
over
his
knee.
They
had
even
taken
her
stupid
secret.
The
storehouse
had
been
big
enough
for
her
to
creep
off
and
make
her
water
in
some
corner
when
no
one
was
looking,
but
it
was
different
on
the
road.
She
held
it
as
long
as
she
could,
but
finally
she
had
to
squat
by
a
bush
and
skin
down
her
breeches
in
front
of
all
of
them.
It
was
that
or
wet
herself.
Hot
Pie
gaped
at
her
with
big
moon
eyes,
but
no
one
else
even
troubled
to
look.
Girl
sheep
or
boy
sheep,
Ser
Gregor
and
his
men
did
not
seem
to
care.

Their
captors
permitted
no
chatter.
A
broken
lip
taught
Arya
to
hold
her
tongue.
Others
never
learned
at
all.
One
boy
of
three
would
not
stop
calling
for
his
father,
so
they
smashed
his
face
in
with
a
spiked
mace.
Then
the
boy’s
mother
started
screaming
and
Raff
the
Sweetling
killed
her
as
well.

Arya
watched
them
die
and
did
nothing.
What
good
did
it
do
you
to
be
brave?
One
of
the
women
picked
for
questioning
had
tried
to
be
brave,
but
she
had
died
screaming
like
all
the
rest.
There
were
no
brave
people
on
that
march,
only
scared
and
hungry
ones.
Most
were
women
and
children.
The
few
men
were
very
old
or
very
young;
the
rest
had
been
chained
to
that
gibbet
and
left
for
the
wolves
and
the
crows.
Gendry
was
only
spared
because
he’d
admitted
to
forging
the
horned
helm
himself;
smiths,
even
apprentice
smiths,
were
too
valuable
to
kill.

They
were
being
taken
to
serve
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
at
Harrenhal,
the
Mountain
told
them.
“You’re
traitors
and
rebels,
so
thank
your
gods
that
Lord
Tywin’s
giving
you
this
chance.
It’s
more
than
you’d
get
from
the
outlaws.
Obey,
serve,
and
live.”

“It’s
not
just,
it’s
not,”
she
heard
one
wizened
old
woman
complain
to
another
when
they
had
bedded
down
for
the
night.
“We
never
did
no
treason,
the
others
come
in
and
took
what
they
wanted,
same
as
this
bunch.”

“Lord
Beric
did
us
no
hurt,
though,”
her
friend
whispered.
“And
that
red
priest
with
him,
he
paid
for
all
they
took.”

“Paid?
He
took
two
of
my
chickens
and
gave
me
a
bit
of
paper
with
a
mark
on
it.
Can
I
eat
a
bit
of
raggy
old
paper,
I
ask
you?
Will
it
give
me
eggs?”
She
looked
about
to
see
that
no
guards
were
near,
and
spat
three
times.
“There’s
for
the
Tullys
and
there’s
for
the
Lannisters
and
there’s
for
the
Starks.”

“It’s
a
sin
and
a
shame,”
an
old
man
hissed.
“When
the
old
king
was
still
alive,
he’d
not
have
stood
for
this.”

“King
Robert?”
Arya
asked,
forgetting
herself.

“King
Aerys,
gods
grace
him,”
the
old
man
said,
too
loudly.
A
guard
came
sauntering
over
to
shut
them
up.
The
old
man
lost
both
his
teeth,
and
there
was
no
more
talk
that
night.

Besides
his
captives,
Ser
Gregor
was
bringing
back
a
dozen
pigs,
a
cage
of
chickens,
a
scrawny
milk
cow,
and
nine
wagons
of
salt
fish.
The
Mountain
and
his
men
had
horses,
but
the
captives
were
all
afoot,
and
those
too
weak
to
keep
up
were
killed
out
of
hand,
along
with
anyone
foolish
enough
to
flee.
The
guards
took
women
off
into
the
bushes
at
night,
and
most
seemed
to
expect
it
and
went
along
meekly
enough.
One
girl,
prettier
than
the
others,
was
made
to
go
with
four
or
five
different
men
every
night,
until
finally
she
hit
one
with
a
rock.
Ser
Gregor
made
everyone
watch
while
he
took
off
her
head
with
a
sweep
of
his
massive
two-handed
greatsword.
“Leave
the
body
for
the
wolves,”
he
commanded
when
the
deed
was
done,
handing
the
sword
to
his
squire
to
be
cleaned.

Arya
glanced
sidelong
at
Needle,
sheathed
at
the
hip
of
a
black-bearded,
balding
man-at-arms
called
Polliver.
It’s
good
that
they
took
it
away,
she
thought.
Otherwise
she
would
have
tried
to
stab
Ser
Gregor,
and
he
would
have
cut
her
right
in
half,
and
the
wolves
would
eat
her
too.

Polliver
was
not
so
bad
as
some
of
the
others,
even
though
he’d
stolen
Needle.
The
night
she
was
caught,
the
Lannister
men
had
been
nameless
strangers
with
faces
as
alike
as
their
nasal
helms,
but
she’d
come
to
know
them
all.
You
had
to
know
who
was
lazy
and
who
was
cruel,
who
was
smart
and
who
was
stupid.
You
had
to
learn
that
even
though
the
one
they
called
Shitmouth
had
the
foulest
tongue
she’d
ever
heard,
he’d
give
you
an
extra
piece
of
bread
if
you
asked,
while
jolly
old
Chiswyck
and
soft-spoken
Raff
would
just
give
you
the
back
of
their
hand.

Arya
watched
and
listened
and
polished
her
hates
the
way
Gendry
had
once
polished
his
horned
helm.
Dunsen
wore
those
bull’s
horns
now,
and
she
hated
him
for
it.
She
hated
Polliver
for
Needle,
and
she
hated
old
Chiswyck
who
thought
he
was
funny.
And
Raff
the
Sweetling,
who’d
driven
his
spear
through
Lommy’s
throat,
she
hated
even
more.
She
hated
Ser
Amory
Lorch
for
Yoren,
and
she
hated
Ser
Meryn
Trant
for
Syrio,
the
Hound
for
killing
the
butcher’s
boy
Mycah,
and
Ser
Ilyn
and
Prince
Joffrey
and
the
queen
for
the
sake
of
her
father
and
Fat
Tom
and
Desmond
and
the
rest,
and
even
for
Lady,
Sansa’s
wolf.
The
Tickler
was
almost
too
scary
to
hate.
At
times
she
could
almost
forget
he
was
still
with
them;
when
he
was
not
asking
questions,
he
was
just
another
soldier,
quieter
than
most,
with
a
face
like
a
thousand
other
men.

Every
night
Arya
would
say
their
names.
“Ser
Gregor,”
she’d
whisper
to
her
stone
pillow.
“Dunsen,
Polliver,
Chiswyck,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.”
Back
in
Winterfell,
Arya
had
prayed
with
her
mother
in
the
sept
and
with
her
father
in
the
godswood,
but
there
were
no
gods
on
the
road
to
Harrenhal,
and
her
names
were
the
only
prayer
she
cared
to
remember.

Every
day
they
marched,
and
every
night
she
said
her
names,
until
finally
the
trees
thinned
and
gave
way
to
a
patchwork
landscape
of
rolling
hills,
meandering
streams,
and
sunlit
fields,
where
the
husks
of
burnt
holdfasts
thrust
up
black
as
rotten
teeth.
It
was
another
long
day’s
march
before
they
glimpsed
the
towers
of
Harrenhal
in
the
distance,
hard
beside
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake.

It
would
be
better
once
they
got
to
Harrenhal,
the
captives
told
each
other,
but
Arya
was
not
so
certain.
She
remembered
Old
Nan’s
stories
of
the
castle
built
on
fear.
Harren
the
Black
had
mixed
human
blood
in
the
mortar,
Nan
used
to
say,
dropping
her
voice
so
the
children
would
need
to
lean
close
to
hear,
but
Aegon’s
dragons
had
roasted
Harren
and
all
his
sons
within
their
great
walls
of
stone.
Arya
chewed
her
lip
as
she
walked
along
on
feet
grown
hard
with
callus.
It
would
not
be
much
longer,
she
told
herself;
those
towers
could
not
be
more
than
a
few
miles
off.

Yet
they
walked
all
that
day
and
most
of
the
next
before
at
last
they
reached
the
fringes
of
Lord
Tywin’s
army,
encamped
west
of
the
castle
amidst
the
scorched
remains
of
a
town.
Harrenhal
was
deceptive
from
afar,
because
it
was
so
huge.
Its
colossal
curtain
walls
rose
beside
the
lake,
sheer
and
sudden
as
mountain
cliffs,
while
atop
their
battlements
the
rows
of
wood-and-iron
scorpions
looked
as
small
as
the
bugs
for
which
they
were
named.

The
stink
of
the
Lannister
host
reached
Arya
well
before
she
could
make
out
the
devices
on
the
banners
that
sprouted
along
the
lakeshore,
atop
the
pavilions
of
the
westermen.
From
the
smell,
Arya
could
tell
that
Lord
Tywin
had
been
here
some
time.
The
latrines
that
ringed
the
encampment
were
overflowing
and
swarming
with
flies,
and
she
saw
faint
greenish
fuzz
on
many
of
the
sharpened
stakes
that
protected
the
perimeters.

Harrenhal’s
gatehouse,
itself
as
large
as
Winterfell’s
Great
Keep,
was
as
scarred
as
it
was
massive,
its
stones
fissured
and
discolored.
From
outside,
only
the
tops
of
five
immense
towers
could
be
seen
beyond
the
walls.
The
shortest
of
them
was
half
again
as
tall
as
the
highest
tower
in
Winterfell,
but
they
did
not
soar
the
way
a
proper
tower
did.
Arya
thought
they
looked
like
some
old
man’s
gnarled,
knuckly
fingers
groping
after
a
passing
cloud.
She
remembered
Nan
telling
how
the
stone
had
melted
and
flowed
like
candlewax
down
the
steps
and
in
the
windows,
glowing
a
sullen
searing
red
as
it
sought
out
Harren
where
he
hid.
Arya
could
believe
every
word;
each
tower
was
more
grotesque
and
misshapen
than
the
last,
lumpy
and
runneled
and
cracked.

“I
don’t
want
to
go
there,”
Hot
Pie
squeaked
as
Harrenhal
opened
its
gates
to
them.
“There’s
ghosts
in
there.”

Chiswyck
heard
him,
but
for
once
he
only
smiled.
“Baker
boy,
here’s
your
choice.
Come
join
the
ghosts,
or
be
one.”

Hot
Pie
went
in
with
the
rest
of
them.

In
the
echoing
stone-and-timber
bathhouse,
the
captives
were
stripped
and
made
to
scrub
and
scrape
themselves
raw
in
tubs
of
scalding
hot
water.
Two
fierce
old
women
supervised
the
process,
discussing
them
as
bluntly
as
if
they
were
newly
acquired
donkeys.
When
Arya’s
turn
came
round,
Goodwife
Amabel
clucked
in
dismay
at
the
sight
of
her
feet,
while
Goodwife
Harra
felt
the
callus
on
her
fingers
that
long
hours
of
practice
with
Needle
had
earned
her.
“Got
those
churning
butter,
I’ll
wager,”
she
said.
“Some
farmer’s
whelp,
are
you?
Well,
never
you
mind,
girl,
you
have
a
chance
to
win
a
higher
place
in
this
world
if
you
work
hard.
If
you
won’t
work
hard,
you’ll
be
beaten.
And
what
do
they
call
you?”

Arya
dared
not
say
her
true
name,
but
Arry
was
no
good
either,
it
was
a
boy’s
name
and
they
could
see
she
was
no
boy.
“Weasel,”
she
said,
naming
the
first
girl
she
could
think
of.
“Lommy
called
me
Weasel.”

“I
can
see
why,”
sniffed
Goodwife
Amabel.
“That
hair
is
a
fright
and
a
nest
for
lice
as
well.
We’ll
have
it
off,
and
then
you’re
for
the
kitchens.”

“I’d
sooner
tend
the
horses.”
Arya
liked
horses,
and
maybe
if
she
was
in
the
stables
she’d
be
able
to
steal
one
and
escape.

Goodwife
Harra
slapped
her
so
hard
that
her
swollen
lip
broke
open
all
over
again.
“And
keep
that
tongue
to
yourself
or
you’ll
get
worse.
No
one
asked
your
views.”

The
blood
in
her
mouth
had
a
salty
metal
tang
to
it.
Arya
dropped
her
gaze
and
said
nothing.
If
I
still
had
Needle,
she
wouldn’t
dare
hit
me,
she
thought
sullenly.

“Lord
Tywin
and
his
knights
have
grooms
and
squires
to
tend
their
horses,
they
don’t
need
the
likes
of
you,”
Goodwife
Amabel
said.
“The
kitchens
are
snug
and
clean,
and
there’s
always
a
warm
fire
to
sleep
by
and
plenty
to
eat.
You
might
have
done
well
there,
but
I
can
see
you’re
not
a
clever
girl.
Harra,
I
believe
we
should
give
this
one
to
Weese.”

“If
you
think
so,
Amabel.”
They
gave
her
a
shift
of
grey
roughspun
wool
and
a
pair
of
ill-fitting
shoes,
and
sent
her
off.

Weese
was
understeward
for
the
Wailing
Tower,
a
squat
man
with
a
fleshy
carbuncle
of
a
nose
and
a
nest
of
angry
red
boils
near
one
corner
of
his
plump
lips.
Arya
was
one
of
six
sent
to
him.
He
looked
them
all
over
with
a
gimlet
eye.
“The
Lannisters
are
generous
to
those
as
serve
them
well,
an
honor
none
of
your
sort
deserve,
but
in
war
a
man
makes
do
with
what’s
to
hand.
Work
hard
and
mind
your
place
and
might
be
one
day
you’ll
rise
as
high
as
me.
If
you
think
to
presume
on
his
lordship’s
kindness,
though,
you’ll
find
me
waiting
after
m’lord
has
gone,
y’see.”
He
strutted
up
and
down
before
them,
telling
them
how
they
must
never
look
the
highborn
in
the
eye,
nor
speak
until
spoken
to,
nor
get
in
his
lordship’s
way.
“My
nose
never
lies,”
he
boasted.
“I
can
smell
defiance,
I
can
smell
pride,
I
can
smell
disobedience.
I
catch
a
whiff
of
any
such
stinks,
you’ll
answer
for
it.
When
I
sniff
you,
all
I
want
to
smell
is
fear.”
=======
he
had
been
jesting
with
her
uncle
at
her
wedding
feast;
the
Mallisters
stood
bannermen
to
the
Tullys,
and
his
gifts
had
been
lavish.
His
brown
hair
was
salted
with
white
now,
his
face
chiseled
gaunt
by
time,
yet
the
years
had
not
touched
his
pride.
He
rode
like
a
man
who
feared
nothing.
Catelyn
envied
him
that;
she
had
come
to
fear
so
much.
As
the
riders
passed,
Lord
Jason
nodded
a
curt
greeting,
but
it
was
only
a
high
lord’s
courtesy
to
strangers
chance
met
on
the
road.
There
was
no
recognition
in
those
fierce
eyes,
and
his
son
did
not
even
waste
a
look.

“He
did
not
know
you,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
after,
wondering.

“He
saw
a
pair
of
mud-spattered
travelers
by
the
side
of
the
road,
wet
and
tired.
It
would
never
occur
to
him
to
suspect
that
one
of
them
was
the
daughter
of
his
liege
lord.
I
think
we
shall
be
safe
enough
at
the
inn,
Ser
Rodrik.”

It
was
near
dark
when
they
reached
it,
at
the
crossroads
north
of
the
great
confluence
of
the
Trident.
Masha
Heddle
was
fatter
and
greyer
than
Catelyn
remembered,
still
chewing
her
sourleaf,
but
she
gave
them
only
the
most
cursory
of
looks,
with
nary
a
hint
of
her
ghastly
red
smile.
“Two
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
stair,
that’s
all
there
is,”
she
said,
chewing
all
the
while.
“They’re
under
the
bell
tower,
you
won’t
be
missing
meals,
though
there’s
some
thinks
it
too
noisy.
Can’t
be
helped.
We’re
full
up,
or
near
as
makes
no
matter.
It’s
those
rooms
or
the
road.”

It
was
those
rooms,
low,
dusty
garrets
at
the
top
of
a
cramped
narrow
staircase.
“Leave
your
boots
down
here,”
Masha
told
them
after
she’d
taken
their
coin.
“The
boy
will
clean
them.
I
won’t
have
you
tracking
mud
up
my
stairs.
Mind
the
bell.
Those
who
come
late
to
meals
don’t
eat.”
There
were
no
smiles,
and
no
mention
of
sweet
cakes.

When
the
supper
bell
rang,
the
sound
was
deafening.
Catelyn
had
changed
into
dry
clothes.
She
sat
by
the
window,
watching
rain
run
down
the
pane.
The
glass
was
milky
and
full
of
bubbles,
and
a
wet
dusk
was
falling
outside.
Catelyn
could
just
make
out
the
muddy
crossing
where
the
two
great
roads
met.

The
crossroads
gave
her
pause.
If
they
turned
west
from
here,
it
was
an
easy
ride
down
to
Riverrun.
Her
father
had
always
given
her
wise
counsel
when
she
needed
it
most,
and
she
yearned
to
talk
to
him,
to
warn
him
of
the
gathering
storm.
If
Winterfell
needed
to
brace
for
war,
how
much
more
so
Riverrun,
so
much
closer
to
King’s
Landing,
with
the
power
of
Casterly
Rock
looming
to
the
west
like
a
shadow.
If
only
her
father
had
been
stronger,
she
might
have
chanced
it,
but
Hoster
Tully
had
been
bedridden
these
past
two
years,
and
Catelyn
was
loath
to
tax
him
now.

The
eastern
road
was
wilder
and
more
dangerous,
climbing
through
rocky
foothills
and
thick
forests
into
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
past
high
passes
and
deep
chasms
to
the
Vale
of
Arryn
and
the
stony
Fingers
beyond.
Above
the
Vale,
the
Eyrie
stood
high
and
impregnable,
its
towers
reaching
for
the
sky.
There
she
would
find
her
sister…
and,
perhaps,
some
of
the
answers
Ned
sought.
Surely
Lysa
knew
more
than
she
had
dared
to
put
in
her
letter.
She
might
have
the
very
proof
that
Ned
needed
to
bring
the
Lannisters
to
ruin,
and
if
it
came
to
war,
they
would
need
the
Arryns
and
the
eastern
lords
who
owed
them
service.

Yet
the
mountain
road
was
perilous.
Shadowcats
prowled
those
passes,
rock
slides
were
common,
and
the
mountain
clans
were
lawless
brigands,
descending
from
the
heights
to
rob
and
kill
and
melting
away
like
snow
whenever
the
knights
rode
out
from
the
Vale
in
search
of
them.
Even
Jon
Arryn,
as
great
a
lord
as
any
the
Eyrie
had
ever
known,
had
always
traveled
in
strength
when
he
crossed
the
mountains.
Catelyn’s
only
strength
was
one
elderly
knight,
armored
in
loyalty.

No,
she
thought,
Riverrun
and
the
Eyrie
would
have
to
wait.
Her
path
ran
north
to
Winterfell,
where
her
sons
and
her
duty
were
waiting
for
her.
As
soon
as
they
were
safely
past
the
Neck,
she
could
declare
herself
to
one
of
Ned’s
bannermen,
and
send
riders
racing
ahead
with
orders
to
mount
a
watch
on
the
kingsroad.

The
rain
obscured
the
fields
beyond
the
crossroads,
but
Catelyn
saw
the
land
clear
enough
in
her
memory.
The
marketplace
was
just
across
the
way,
and
the
village
a
mile
farther
on,
half
a
hundred
white
cottages
surrounding
a
small
stone
sept.
There
would
be
more
now;
the
summer
had
been
long
and
peaceful.
North
of
here
the
kingsroad
ran
along
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident,
through
fertile
valleys
and
green
woodlands,
past
thriving
towns
and
stout
holdfasts
and
the
castles
of
the
river
lords.

Catelyn
knew
them
all:
the
Blackwoods
and
the
Brackens,
ever
enemies,
whose
quarrels
her
father
was
obliged
to
settle;
Lady
Whent,
last
of
her
line,
who
dwelt
with
her
ghosts
in
the
cavernous
vaults
of
Harrenhal;
irascible
Lord
Frey,
who
had
outlived
seven
wives
and
filled
his
twin
castles
with
children,
grandchildren,
and
great-grandchildren,
and
bastards
and
grandbastards
as
well.
All
of
them
were
bannermen
to
the
Tullys,
their
swords
sworn
to
the
service
of
Riverrun.
Catelyn
wondered
if
that
would
be
enough,
if
it
came
to
war.
Her
father
was
the
staunchest
man
who’d
ever
lived,
and
she
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
call
his
banners…
but
would
the
banners
come?
The
Darrys
and
Rygers
and
Mootons
had
sworn
oaths
to
Riverrun
as
well,
yet
they
had
fought
with
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident,
while
Lord
Frey
had
arrived
with
his
levies
well
after
the
battle
was
over,
leaving
some
doubt
as
to
which
army
he
had
planned
to
join
(theirs,
he
had
assured
the
victors
solemnly
in
the
aftermath,
but
ever
after
her
father
had
called
him
the
Late
Lord
Frey).
It
must
not
come
to
war,
Catelyn
thought
fervently.
They
must
not
let
it.

Ser
Rodrik
came
for
her
just
as
the
bell
ceased
its
clangor.
“We
had
best
make
haste
if
we
hope
to
eat
tonight,
my
lady.”

“It
might
be
safer
if
we
were
not
knight
and
lady
until
we
pass
the
Neck,”
she
told
him.
“Common
travelers
attract
less
notice.
A
father
and
daughter
taken
to
the
road
on
some
family
business,
say.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
agreed.
It
was
only
when
she
laughed
that
he
realized
what
he’d
done.
“The
old
courtesies
die
hard,
my—my
daughter.”
He
tried
to
tug
on
his
missing
whiskers,
and
sighed
with
exasperation.

Catelyn
took
his
arm.
“Come,
Father,”
she
said.
“You’ll
find
that
Masha
Heddle
sets
a
good
table,
I
think,
but
try
not
to
praise
her.
You
truly
don’t
want
to
see
her
smile.”

The
common
room
was
long
and
drafty,
with
a
row
of
huge
wooden
kegs
at
one
end
and
a
fireplace
at
the
other.
A
serving
boy
ran
back
and
forth
with
skewers
of
meat
while
Masha
drew
beer
from
the
kegs,
chewing
her
sourleaf
all
the
while.

The
benches
were
crowded,
townsfolk
and
farmers
mingling
freely
with
all
manner
of
travelers.
The
crossroads
made
for
odd
companions;
dyers
with
black
and
purple
hands
shared
a
bench
with
rivermen
reeking
of
fish,
an
ironsmith
thick
with
muscle
squeezed
in
beside
a
wizened
old
septon,
hard-bitten
sellswords
and
soft
plump
merchants
swapped
news
like
boon
companions.

The
company
included
more
swords
than
Catelyn
would
have
liked.
Three
by
the
fire
wore
the
red
stallion
badge
of
the
Brackens,
and
there
was
a
large
party
in
blue
steel
ringmail
and
capes
of
a
silvery
grey.
On
their
shoulder
was
another
familiar
sigil,
the
twin
towers
of
House
Frey.
She
studied
their
faces,
but
they
were
all
too
young
to
have
known
her.
The
senior
among
them
would
have
been
no
older
than
Bran
when
she
went
north.

Ser
Rodrik
found
them
an
empty
place
on
the
bench
near
the
kitchen.
Across
the
table
a
handsome
youth
was
fingering
a
woodharp.
“Seven
blessings
to
you,
goodfolk,”
he
said
as
they
sat.
An
empty
wine
cup
stood
on
the
table
before
him.

“And
to
you,
singer,”
Catelyn
returned.
Ser
Rodrik
called
for
bread
and
meat
and
beer
in
a
tone
that
meant
now.
The
singer,
a
youth
of
some
eighteen
years,
eyed
them
boldly
and
asked
where
they
were
going,
and
from
whence
they
had
come,
and
what
news
they
had,
letting
the
questions
fly
as
quick
as
arrows
and
never
pausing
for
an
answer.
“We
left
King’s
Landing
a
fortnight
ago,”
Catelyn
replied,
answering
the
safest
of
his
questions.

“That’s
where
I’m
bound,”
the
youth
said.
As
she
had
suspected,
he
was
more
interested
in
telling
his
own
story
than
in
hearing
theirs.
Singers
loved
nothing
half
so
well
as
the
sound
of
their
own
voices.
“The
Hand’s
tourney
means
rich
lords
with
fat
purses.
The
last
time
I
came
away
with
more
silver
than
I
could
carry…
or
would
have,
if
I
hadn’t
lost
it
all
betting
on
the
Kingslayer
to
win
the
day.”

“The
gods
frown
on
the
gambler,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
sternly.
He
was
of
the
north,
and
shared
the
Stark
views
on
tournaments.

“They
frowned
on
me,
for
certain,”
the
singer
said.
“Your
cruel
gods
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers
altogether
did
me
in.”

“No
doubt
that
was
a
lesson
for
you,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

“It
was.
This
time
my
coin
will
champion
Ser
Loras.”

Ser
Rodrik
tried
to
tug
at
whiskers
that
were
not
there,
but
before
he
could
frame
a
rebuke
the
serving
boy
came
scurrying
up.
He
laid
trenchers
of
bread
before
them
and
filled
them
with
chunks
of
browned
meat
off
a
skewer,
dripping
with
hot
juice.
Another
skewer
held
tiny
onions,
fire
peppers,
and
fat
mushrooms.
Ser
Rodrik
set
to
lustily
as
the
lad
ran
back
to
fetch
them
beer.

“My
name
is
Marillion,”
the
singer
said,
plucking
a
string
on
his
woodharp.
“Doubtless
you’ve
heard
me
play
somewhere?”

His
manner
made
Catelyn
smile.
Few
wandering
singers
ever
ventured
as
far
north
as
Winterfell,
but
she
knew
his
like
from
her
girlhood
in
Riverrun.
“I
fear
not,”
she
told
him.

He
drew
a
plaintive
chord
from
the
woodharp.
“That
is
your
loss,”
he
said.
“Who
was
the
finest
singer
you’ve
ever
heard?”

“Alia
of
Braavos,”
Ser
Rodrik
answered
at
once.

“Oh,
I’m
much
better
than
that
old
stick,”
Marillion
said.
“If
you
have
the
silver
for
a
song,
I’ll
gladly
show
you.”

“I
might
have
a
copper
or
two,
but
I’d
sooner
toss
it
down
a
well
than
pay
for
your
howling,”
Ser
Rodrik
groused.
His
opinion
of
singers
was
well
known;
music
was
a
lovely
thing
for
girls,
but
he
could
not
comprehend
why
any
healthy
boy
would
fill
his
hand
with
a
harp
when
he
might
have
had
a
sword.

“Your
grandfather
has
a
sour
nature,”
Marillion
said
to
Catelyn.
“I
meant
to
do
you
honor.
An
homage
to
your
beauty.
In
truth,
I
was
made
to
sing
for
kings
and
high
lords.”

“Oh,
I
can
see
that,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lord
Tully
is
fond
of
song,
I
hear.
No
doubt
you’ve
been
to
Riverrun.”

“A
hundred
times,”
the
singer
said
airily.
“They
keep
a
chamber
for
me,
and
the
young
lord
is
like
a
brother.”

Catelyn
smiled,
wondering
what
Edmure
would
think
of
that.
Another
singer
had
once
bedded
a
girl
her
brother
fancied;
he
had
hated
the
breed
ever
since.
“And
Winterfell?”
she
asked
him.
“Have
you
traveled
north?”

“Why
would
I?’
Marillion
asked.
“It’s
all
blizzards
and
bearskins
up
there,
and
the
Starks
know
no
music
but
the
howling
of
wolves.”
Distantly,
she
was
aware
of
the
door
banging
open
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.

“Innkeep,”
a
servant’s
voice
called
out
behind
her,
“we
have
horses
that
want
stabling,
and
my
lord
of
Lannister
requires
a
room
and
a
hot
bath.”

“Oh,
gods,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
before
Catelyn
reached
out
to
silence
him,
her
fingers
tightening
hard
around
his
forearm.

Masha
Heddle
was
bowing
and
smiling
her
hideous
red
smile.
“I’m
sorry,
m’lord,
truly,
we’re
full
up,
every
room.”

There
were
four
of
them,
Catelyn
saw.
An
old
man
in
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
two
servants…
and
him,
standing
there
small
and
bold
as
life.
“My
men
will
steep
in
your
stable,
and
as
for
myself,
well,
I
do
not
require
a
large
room,
as
you
can
plainly
see.”
He
flashed
a
mocking
grin.
“So
long
as
the
fire’s
warm
and
the
straw
reasonably
free
of
fleas,
I
am
a
happy
man.”

Masha
Heddle
was
beside
herself.
“M’lord,
there’s
nothing,
it’s
the
tourney,
there’s
no
help
for
it,
oh…”

Tyrion
Lannister
pulled
a
coin
from
his
purse
and
flicked
it
up
over
his
head,
caught
it,
tossed
it
again.
Even
across
the
room,
where
Catelyn
sat,
the
wink
of
gold
was
unmistakable.

A
freerider
in
a
faded
blue
cloak
lurched
to
his
feet.
“You’re
welcome
to
my
room,
m’lord.”

“Now
there’s
a
clever
man,”
Lannister
said
as
he
sent
the
coin
spinning
across
the
room.
The
freerider
snatched
it
from
the
air.
“And
a
nimble
one
to
boot.”
The
dwarf
turned
back
to
Masha
Heddle.
“You
will
be
able
to
manage
food,
I
trust?”

“Anything
you
like,
m’lord,
anything
at
all,”
the
innkeep
promised.
And
may
he
choke
on
it,
Catelyn
thought,
but
it
was
Bran
she
saw
choking,
drowning
on
his
own
blood.

Lannister
glanced
at
the
nearest
tables.
“My
men
will
have
whatever
you’re
serving
these
people.
Double
portions,
we’ve
had
a
long
hard
ride.
I’ll
take
a
roast
fowl—chicken,
duck,
pigeon,
it
makes
no
matter.
And
send
up
a
flagon
of
your
best
wine.
Yoren,
will
you
sup
with
me?”

“Aye,
m’lord,
I
will,”
the
black
brother
replied.

The
dwarf
had
not
so
much
as
glanced
toward
the
far
end
of
the
room,
and
Catelyn
was
thinking
how
grateful
she
was
for
the
crowded
benches
between
them
when
suddenly
Marillion
bounded
to
his
feet.
“My
lord
of
Lannister!”
he
called
out.
“I
would
be
pleased
to
entertain
you
while
you
eat.
Let
me
sing
you
the
lay
of
your
father’s
great
victory
at
King’s
Landing!”

“Nothing
would
be
more
likely
to
ruin
my
supper,”
the
dwarf
said
dryly.
His
mismatched
eyes
considered
the
singer
briefly,
started
to
move
away…
and
found
Catelyn.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment,
puzzled.
She
turned
her
face
away,
but
too
late.
The
dwarf
was
smiling.
“Lady
Stark,
what
an
unexpected
pleasure,”
he
said.
“I
was
sorry
to
miss
you
at
Winterfell.”

Marillion
gaped
at
her,
confusion
giving
way
to
chagrin
as
Catelyn
rose
slowly
to
her
feet.
She
heard
Ser
Rodrik
curse.
If
only
the
man
had
lingered
at
the
Wall,
she
thought,
if
only…

“Lady…
Stark?”
Masha
Heddle
said
thickly.

“I
was
still
Catelyn
Tully
the
last
time
I
bedded
here,”
she
told
the
innkeep.
She
could
hear
the
muttering,
feel
the
eyes
upon
her.
Catelyn
glanced
around
the
room,
at
the
faces
of
the
knights
and
sworn
swords,
and
took
a
deep
breath
to
slow
the
frantic
beating
of
her
heart.
Did
she
dare
take
the
risk?
There
was
no
time
to
think
it
through,
only
the
moment
and
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
ringing
in
her
ears.
“You
in
the
corner,”
she
said
to
an
older
man
she
had
not
noticed
until
now.
“Is
that
the
black
bat
of
Harrenhal
I
see
embroidered
on
your
surcoat,
ser?”

The
man
got
to
his
feet.
“It
is,
my
lady.”

“And
is
Lady
Whent
a
true
and
honest
friend
to
my
father,
Lord
Hoster
Tully
of
Riverrun?”

“She
is,”
the
man
replied
stoutly.

Ser
Rodrik
rose
quietly
and
loosened
his
sword
in
its
scabbard.
The
dwarf
was
blinking
at
them,
blank-faced,
with
puzzlement
in
his
mismatched
eyes.

“The
red
stallion
was
ever
a
welcome
sight
in
Riverrun,”
she
said
to
the
trio
by
the
fire.
“My
father
counts
Jonos
Bracken
among
his
oldest
and
most
loyal
bannermen.”

The
three
men-at-arms
exchanged
uncertain
looks.
“Our
lord
is
honored
by
his
trust,”
one
of
them
said
hesitantly.

“I
envy
your
father
all
these
fine
friends,”
Lannister
quipped,
“but
I
do
not
quite
see
the
purpose
of
this,
Lady
Stark.”

She
ignored
him,
turning
to
the
large
party
in
blue
and
grey.
They
were
the
heart
of
the
matter;
there
were
more
than
twenty
of
them.
“I
know
your
sigil
as
well:
the
twin
towers
of
Frey.
How
fares
your
good
lord,
sers?”

Their
captain
rose.
“Lord
Walder
is
well,
my
lady.
He
plans
to
take
a
new
wife
on
his
ninetieth
name
day,
and
has
asked
your
lord
father
to
honor
the
wedding
with
his
presence.”

Tyrion
Lannister
sniggered.
That
was
when
Catelyn
knew
he
was
hers.
“This
man
came
a
guest
into
my
house,
and
there
conspired
to
murder
my
son,
a
boy
of
seven,”
she
proclaimed
to
the
room
at
large,
pointing.
Ser
Rodrik
moved
to
her
side,
his
sword
in
hand.
“In
the
name
of
King
Robert
and
the
good
lords
you
serve,
I
call
upon
you
to
seize
him
and
help
me
return
him
to
Winterfell
to
await
the
king’s
justice.”

She
did
not
know
what
was
more
satisfying:
the
sound
of
a
dozen
swords
drawn
as
one
or
the
look
on
Tyrion
Lannister’s
face.

DAENERYS

On
the
walls
of
Qarth,
men
beat
gongs
to
herald
her
coming,
while
others
blew
curious
horns
that
encircled
their
bodies
like
great
bronze
snakes.
A
column
of
camelry
emerged
from
the
city
as
her
honor
guards.
The
riders
wore
scaled
copper
armor
and
snouted
helms
with
copper
tusks
and
long
black
silk
plumes,
and
sat
high
on
saddles
inlaid
with
rubies
and
garnets.
Their
camels
were
dressed
in
blankets
of
a
hundred
different
hues.

“Qarth
is
the
greatest
city
that
ever
was
or
ever
will
be,”
Pyat
Pree
had
told
her,
back
amongst
the
bones
of
Vaes
Tolorro.
“It
is
the
center
of
the
world,
the
gate
between
north
and
south,
the
bridge
between
east
and
west,
ancient
beyond
memory
of
man
and
so
magnificent
that
Saathos
the
Wise
put
out
his
eyes
after
gazing
upon
Qarth
for
the
first
time,
because
he
knew
that
all
he
saw
thereafter
should
look
squalid
and
ugly
by
comparison.”

Dany
took
the
warlock’s
words
well
salted,
but
the
magnificence
of
the
great
city
was
not
to
be
denied.
Three
thick
walls
encircled
Qarth,
elaborately
carved.
The
outer
was
red
sandstone,
thirty
feet
high
and
decorated
with
animals:
snakes
slithering,
kites
flying,
fish
swimming,
intermingled
with
wolves
of
the
red
waste
and
striped
zorses
and
monstrous
elephants.
The
middle
wall,
forty
feet
high,
was
grey
granite
alive
with
scenes
of
war:
the
clash
of
sword
and
shield
and
spear,
arrows
in
flight,
heroes
at
battle
and
babes
being
butchered,
pyres
of
the
dead.
The
innermost
wall
was
fifty
feet
of
black
marble,
with
carvings
that
made
Dany
blush
until
she
told
herself
that
she
was
being
a
fool.
She
was
no
maid;
if
she
could
look
on
the
grey
wall’s
scenes
of
slaughter,
why
should
she
avert
her
eyes
from
the
sight
of
men
and
women
giving
pleasure
to
one
another?

The
outer
gates
were
banded
with
copper,
the
middle
with
iron;
the
innermost
were
studded
with
golden
eyes.
All
opened
at
Dany’s
approach.
As
she
rode
her
silver
into
the
city,
small
children
rushed
out
to
scatter
flowers
in
her
path.
They
wore
golden
sandals
and
bright
paint,
no
more.

All
the
colors
that
had
been
missing
from
Vaes
Tolorro
had
found
their
way
to
Qarth;
buildings
crowded
about
her
fantastical
as
a
fever
dream
in
shades
of
rose,
violet,
and
umber.
She
passed
under
a
bronze
arch
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
two
snakes
mating,
their
scales
delicate
flakes
of
jade,
obsidian,
and
lapis
lazuli.
Slim
towers
stood
taller
than
any
Dany
had
ever
seen,
and
elaborate
fountains
filled
every
square,
wrought
in
the
shapes
of
griffins
and
dragons
and
manticores.

The
Qartheen
lined
the
streets
and
watched
from
delicate
balconies
that
looked
too
frail
to
support
their
weight.
They
were
tall
pale
folk
in
linen
and
samite
and
tiger
fur,
every
one
a
lord
or
lady
to
her
eyes.
The
women
wore
gowns
that
left
one
breast
bare,
while
the
men
favored
beaded
silk
skirts.
Dany
felt
shabby
and
barbaric
as
she
rode
past
them
in
her
lionskin
robe
with
black
Drogon
on
one
shoulder.
Her
Dothraki
called
the
Qartheen
“Milk
Men”
for
their
paleness,
and
Khal
Drogo
had
dreamed
of
the
day
when
he
might
sack
the
great
cities
of
the
east.
She
glanced
at
her
bloodriders,
their
dark
almond-shaped
eyes
giving
no
hint
of
their
thoughts.
Is
it
only
the
plunder
they
see?
she
wondered.
How
savage
we
must
seem
to
these
Qartheen.

Pyrat
Pree
conducted
her
little
khalasar
down
the
center
of
a
great
arcade
where
the
city’s
ancient
heroes
stood
thrice
life-size
on
columns
of
white
and
green
marble.
They
passed
through
a
bazaar
in
a
cavernous
building
whose
latticework
ceiling
was
home
to
a
thousand
gaily
colored
birds.
Trees
and
flowers
bloomed
on
the
terraced
walls
above
the
stalls,
while
below
it
seemed
as
if
everything
the
gods
had
put
into
the
world
was
for
sale.

Her
silver
shied
as
the
merchant
prince
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
rode
up
to
her;
the
horses
could
not
abide
the
close
presence
of
camels,
she
had
found.
“If
you
see
here
anything
that
you
would
desire,
O
most
beautiful
of
women,
you
have
only
to
speak
and
it
is
yours,”
Xaro
called
down
from
his
ornate
horned
saddle.

“Qarth
itself
is
hers,
she
has
no
need
of
baubles,”
blue-lipped
Pyat
Pree
sang
out
from
her
other
side.
“It
shall
be
as
I
promised,
Khaleesi.
Come
with
me
to
the
House
of
the
Undying,
and
you
shall
drink
of
truth
and
wisdom.”

“Why
should
she
need
your
Palace
of
Dust,
when
I
can
give
her
sunlight
and
sweet
water
and
silks
to
sleep
in?”
Xaro
said
to
the
warlock.
“The
Thirteen
shall
set
a
crown
of
black
jade
and
fire
opals
upon
her
lovely
head.”

“The
only
palace
I
desire
is
the
red
castle
at
King’s
Landing,
my
lord
Pyat.”
Dany
was
wary
of
the
warlock;
the
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
soured
her
on
those
who
played
at
sorcery.
“And
if
the
great
of
Qarth
would
give
me
gifts,
Xaro,
let
them
give
me
ships
and
swords
to
win
back
what
is
rightfully
mine.”

Pyat’s
blue
lips
curled
upward
in
a
gracious
smile.
“it
shall
be
as
you
command,
Khaleesi.”
He
moved
away,
swaying
with
his
camel’s
motion,
his
long
beaded
robes
trailing
behind.

“The
young
queen
is
wise
beyond
her
years,”
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
murmured
down
at
her
from
his
high
saddle.
“There
is
a
saying
in
Qarth.
A
warlock’s
house
is
built
of
bones
and
lies.”

“Then
why
do
men
lower
their
voices
when
they
speak
of
the
warlocks
of
Qarth?
All
across
the
east,
their
power
and
wisdom
are
revered.”

“Once
they
were
mighty,”
Xaro
agreed,
“but
now
they
are
as
ludicrous
as
those
feeble
old
soldiers
who
boast
of
their
prowess
long
after
strength
and
skill
have
left
them.
They
read
their
crumbling
scrolls,
drink
shade-of-the-evening
until
their
lips
turn
blue,
and
hint
of
dread
powers,
but
they
are
hollow
husks
compared
to
those
who
went
before.
Pyat
Pree’s
gifts
will
turn
to
dust
in
your
hands,
I
warn
you.”
He
gave
his
camel
a
lick
of
his
whip
and
sped
away.

“The
crow
calls
the
raven
black,”
muttered
Ser
Jorah
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros.
The
exile
knight
rode
at
her
right
hand,
as
ever.
For
their
entrance
into
Qarth,
he
had
put
away
his
Dothraki
garb
and
donned
again
the
plate
and
mail
and
wool
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
half
a
world
away.
“You
would
do
well
to
avoid
both
those
men,
Your
Grace.”

“Those
men
will
help
me
to
my
crown,”
she
said.
“Xaro
has
vast
wealth,
and
Pyat
Pree—”

“—pretends
to
power,”
the
knight
said
brusquely.
On
his
dark
green
surcoat,
the
bear
of
House
Mormont
stood
on
its
hind
legs,
black
and
fierce.
Jorah
looked
no
less
ferocious
as
he
scowled
at
the
crowd
that
filled
the
bazaar.
“I
would
not
linger
here
long,
my
queen.
I
mislike
the
very
smell
of
this
place.”

Dany
smiled.
“Perhaps
it’s
the
camels
you’re
smelling.
The
Qartheen
themselves
seem
sweet
enough
to
my
nose.”

“Sweet
smells
are
sometimes
used
to
cover
foul
ones.”

My
great
bear,
Dany
thought.
I
am
his
queen,
but
I
will
always
be
his
cub
as
well,
and
he
will
always
guard
me.
It
made
her
feel
safe,
but
sad
as
well.
She
wished
she
could
love
him
better
than
she
did.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
had
offered
Dany
the
hospitality
of
his
home
while
she
was
in
the
city.
She
had
expected
something
grand.
She
had
not
expected
a
palace
larger
than
many
a
market
town.
It
makes
Magister
Illyrio’s
manse
in
Pentos
look
like
a
swineherd’s
hovel,
she
thought.
Xaro
swore
that
his
home
could
comfortably
house
all
of
her
people
and
their
horses
besides;
indeed,
it
swallowed
them.
An
entire
wing
was
given
over
to
her.
She
would
have
her
own
gardens,
a
marble
bathing
pool,
a
scrying
tower
and
warlock’s
maze.
Slaves
would
tend
her
every
need.
In
her
private
chambers,
the
floors
were
green
marble,
the
walls
draped
with
colorful
silk
hangings
that
shimmered
with
every
breath
of
air.
“You
are
too
generous,”
she
told
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.

“For
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
no
gift
is
too
great.”
Xaro
was
a
languid,
elegant
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
crusted
with
rubies,
opals,
and
flakes
of
jade.
“On
the
morrow,
you
shall
feast
upon
peacock
and
lark’s
tongue,
and
hear
music
worthy
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women.
The
Thirteen
will
come
to
do
you
homage,
and
all
the
great
of
Qarth.”

All
the
great
of
Qarth
will
come
to
see
my
dragons,
Dany
thought,
yet
she
thanked
Xaro
for
his
kindness
before
she
sent
him
on
his
way.
Pyat
Pree
took
his
leave
as
well,
vowing
to
petition
the
Undying
Ones
for
an
audience.
“A
honor
rare
as
summer
snows.”
Before
he
left
he
kissed
her
bare
feet
with
his
pale
blue
lips
and
pressed
on
her
a
gift,
a
jar
of
ointment
that
he
swore
would
let
her
see
the
spirits
of
the
air.
Last
of
the
three
seekers
to
depart
was
Quaithe
the
shadowbinder.
From
her
Dany
received
only
a
warning.
“Beware,”
the
woman
in
the
red
lacquer
mask
said.

“Of
whom?”

“Of
all.
They
shall
come
day
and
night
to
see
the
wonder
that
has
been
born
again
into
the
world,
and
when
they
see
they
shall
lust.
For
dragons
are
fire
made
flesh,
and
fire
is
power.”

When
Quaithe
too
was
gone,
Ser
Jorah
said,
“She
speaks
truly,
my
queen…
though
I
like
her
no
more
than
the
others.”

“I
do
not
understand
her.”
Pyat
and
Xaro
had
showered
Dany
with
promises
from
the
moment
they
first
glimpsed
her
dragons,
declaring
themselves
her
loyal
servants
in
all
things,
but
from
Quaithe
she
had
gotten
only
the
rare
cryptic
word.
And
it
disturbed
her
that
she
had
never
seen
the
woman’s
face.
Remember
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
she
told
herself.
Remember
treachery.
She
turned
to
her
bloodriders.
“We
will
keep
our
own
watch
so
long
as
we
are
here.
See
that
no
one
enters
this
wing
of
the
palace
without
my
leave,
and
take
care
that
the
dragons
are
always
well
guarded.”

“It
shall
be
done,
Khaleesi,”
Aggo
said.

“We
have
seen
only
the
parts
of
Qarth
that
Pyat
Pree
wished
us
to
see,”
she
went
on.
“Rakharo,
go
forth
and
look
on
the
rest,
and
tell
me
what
you
find.
Take
good
men
with
you—and
women,
to
go
places
where
men
are
forbidden.”

“As
you
say,
I
do,
blood
of
my
blood,”
said
Rakharo.

“Ser
Jorah,
find
the
docks
and
see
what
manner
of
ships
lay
at
anchor.
It
has
been
half
a
year
since
I
last
heard
tidings
from
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Perhaps
the
gods
will
have
blown
some
good
captain
here
from
Westeros
with
a
ship
to
carry
us
home.”

The
knight
frowned.
“That
would
be
no
kindness.
The
Usurper
will
kill
you,
sure
as
sunrise.”
Mormont
hooked
his
thumbs
through
his
swordbelt.
“My
place
is
here
at
your
side.”

“Jhogo
can
guard
me
as
well.
You
have
more
languages
than
my
bloodriders,
and
the
Dothraki
mistrust
the
sea
and
those
who
sail
her.
Only
you
can
serve
me
in
this.
Go
among
the
ships
and
speak
to
the
crews,
learn
where
they
are
from
and
where
they
are
bound
and
what
manner
of
men
command
them.”

Reluctantly,
the
exile
nodded.
“As
you
say,
my
queen.”

When
all
the
men
had
gone,
her
handmaids
stripped
off
the
travel-stained
silks
she
wore,
and
Dany
padded
out
to
where
the
marble
pool
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
portico.
The
water
was
deliciously
cool,
and
the
pool
was
stocked
with
tiny
golden
fish
that
nibbled
curiously
at
her
skin
and
made
her
giggle.
It
felt
good
to
close
her
eyes
and
float,
knowing
she
could
rest
as
long
as
she
liked.
She
wondered
whether
Aegon’s
Red
Keep
had
a
pool
like
this,
and
fragrant
gardens
full
of
lavender
and
mint.
It
must,
surely.
Viserys
always
said
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
more
beautiful
than
any
other
place
in
the
world.

The
thought
of
home
disquieted
her.
If
her
sun-and-stars
had
lived,
he
would
have
led
his
khalasar
across
the
poison
water
and
swept
away
her
enemies,
but
his
strength
had
left
the
world.
Her
bloodriders
remained,
sworn
to
her
for
life
and
skilled
in
slaughter,
but
only
in
the
ways
of
the
horselords.
The
Dothraki
sacked
cities
and
plundered
kingdoms,
they
did
not
rule
them.
Dany
had
no
wish
to
reduce
King’s
Landing
to
a
blackened
ruin
full
of
unquiet
ghosts.
She
had
supped
enough
on
tears.
I
want
to
make
my
kingdom
beautiful,
to
fill
it
with
fat
men
and
pretty
maids
and
laughing
children.
I
want
my
people
to
smile
when
they
see
me
ride
by,
the
way
Viserys
said
they
smiled
for
my
father.

But
before
she
could
do
that
she
must
conquer.

The
Usurper
will
kill
you,
sure
as
sunrise,
Mormont
had
said.
Robert
had
slain
her
gallant
brother
Rhaegar,
and
one
of
his
creatures
had
crossed
the
Dothraki
sea
to
poison
her
and
her
unborn
son.
They
said
Robert
Baratheon
was
strong
as
a
bull
and
fearless
in
battle,
a
man
who
loved
nothing
better
than
war.
And
with
him
stood
the
great
lords
her
brother
had
named
the
Usurper’s
dogs,
cold-eyed
Eddard
Stark
with
his
frozen
heart,
and
the
golden
Lannisters,
father
and
son,
so
rich,
so
powerful,
so
treacherous.

How
could
she
hope
to
overthrow
such
men?
When
Khal
Drogo
had
lived,
men
trembled
and
made
him
gifts
to
stay
his
wrath.
If
they
did
not,
he
took
their
cities,
wealth
and
wives
and
all.
But
his
khalasar
had
been
vast,
while
hers
was
meager.
Her
people
had
followed
her
across
the
red
waste
as
she
chased
her
comet,
and
would
follow
her
across
the
poison
water
too,
but
they
would
not
be
enough.
Even
her
dragons
might
not
be
enough.
Viserys
had
believed
that
the
realm
would
rise
for
its
rightful
king…
but
Viserys
had
been
a
fool,
and
fools
believe
in
foolish
things.

Her
doubts
made
her
shiver.
Suddenly
the
water
felt
cold
to
her,
and
the
little
fish
prickling
at
her
skin
annoying.
Dany
stood
and
climbed
from
the
pool.
“Irri,”
she
called,
“Jhiqui.”

As
the
handmaids
toweled
her
dry
and
wrapped
her
in
a
sandsilk
robe,
Dany’s
thoughts
went
to
the
three
who
had
sought
her
out
in
the
City
of
Bones.
The
Bleeding
Star
led
me
to
Qarth
for
a
purpose.
Here
I
will
find
what
I
need,
if
I
have
the
strength
to
take
what
is
offered,
and
the
wisdom
to
avoid
the
traps
and
snares.
If
the
gods
mean
for
me
to
conquer,
they
will
provide,
they
will
send
me
a
sign,
and
if
not…
if
not…

It
was
near
evenfall
and
Dany
was
feeding
her
dragons
when
Irri
stepped
through
the
silken
curtains
to
tell
her
that
Ser
Jorah
had
returned
from
the
docks…
and
not
alone.
“Send
him
in,
with
whomever
he
has
brought,”
she
said,
curious.

When
they
entered,
she
was
seated
on
a
mound
of
cushions,
her
dragons
all
about
her.
The
man
he
brought
with
him
wore
a
cloak
of
green
and
yellow
feathers
and
had
skin
as
black
as
polished
jet.
“Your
Grace,”
the
knight
said,
“I
bring
you
Quhuru
Mo,
captain
of
the
Cinnamon
Wind
out
of
Tall
Trees
Town.”

The
black
man
knelt.
“I
am
greatly
honored,
my
queen,”
he
said;
not
in
the
tongue
of
the
Summer
Isles,
which
Dany
did
not
know,
but
in
the
liquid
Valyrian
of
the
Nine
Free
Cities.

“The
honor
is
mine,
Quhuru
Mo,”
said
Dany
in
the
same
language.
“Have
you
come
from
the
Summer
Isles?”

“This
is
so,
Your
Grace,
but
before,
not
half
a
year
past,
we
called
at
Oldtown.
From
there
I
bring
you
a
wondrous
gift.”

“A
gift?”

“A
gift
of
news.
Dragonmother,
Stormborn,
I
tell
you
true,
Robert
Baratheon
is
dead.”

Outside
her
walls,
dusk
was
settling
over
Qarth,
but
a
sun
had
risen
in
Dany’s
heart.
“Dead?”
she
repeated.
In
her
lap,
black
Drogon
hissed,
and
pale
smoke
rose
before
her
face
like
a
veil.
“You
are
certain?
The
Usurper
is
dead?”

“So
it
is
said
in
Oldtown,
and
Dorne,
and
Lys,
and
all
the
other
ports
where
we
have
called.”

He
sent
me
poisoned
wine,
yet
I
live
and
he
is
gone.
“What
was
the
manner
of
his
death?”
On
her
shoulder,
pale
Viserion
flapped
wings
the
color
of
cream,
stirring
the
air.

“Torn
by
a
monstrous
boar
whilst
hunting
in
his
kingswood,
or
so
I
heard
in
Oldtown.
Others
say
his
queen
betrayed
him,
or
his
brother,
or
Lord
Stark
who
was
his
Hand.
Yet
all
the
tales
agree
in
this:
King
Robert
is
dead
and
in
his
grave.”

Dany
had
never
looked
upon
the
Usurper’s
face,
yet
seldom
a
day
had
passed
when
she
had
not
thought
of
him.
His
great
shadow
had
lain
across
her
since
the
hour
of
her
birth,
when
she
came
forth
amidst
blood
and
storm
into
a
world
where
she
no
longer
had
a
place.
And
now
this
ebony
stranger
had
lifted
that
shadow.

“The
boy
sits
the
Iron
Throne
now,”
Ser
Jorah
said.

“King
Joffrey
reigns,”
Quhuru
Mo
agreed,
“but
the
Lannisters
rule.
Robert’s
brothers
have
fled
King’s
Landing.
The
talk
is,
they
mean
to
claim
the
crown.
And
the
Hand
has
fallen,
Lord
Stark
who
was
King
Robert’s
friend.
He
has
been
seized
for
treason.”

“Ned
Stark
a
traitor?”
Ser
Jorah
snorted.
“Not
bloody
likely.
The
Long
Summer
will
come
again
before
that
one
would
besmirch
his
precious
honor.”

“What
honor
could
he
have?”
Dany
said.
“He
was
a
traitor
to
his
true
king,
as
were
these
Lannisters.”
It
pleased
her
to
hear
that
the
Usurper’s
dogs
were
fighting
amongst
themselves,
though
she
was
unsurprised.
The
same
thing
happened
when
her
Drogo
died,
and
his
great
khalasar
tore
itself
to
pieces.
“My
brother
is
dead
as
well,
Viserys
who
was
the
true
king,”
she
told
the
Summer
Islander.
“Khal
Drogo
my
lord
husband
killed
him
with
a
crown
of
molten
gold.”
Would
her
brother
have
been
any
wiser,
had
he
known
that
the
vengeance
he
had
prayed
for
was
so
close
at
hand?

“Then
I
grieve
for
you,
Dragonmother,
and
for
bleeding
Westeros,
bereft
of
its
rightful
king.”

Beneath
Dany’s
gentle
fingers,
green
Rhaegal
stared
at
the
stranger
with
eyes
of
molten
gold.
When
his
mouth
opened,
his
teeth
gleamed
like
black
needles.
“When
does
your
ship
return
to
Westeros,
Captain?”

“Not
for
a
year
or
more,
I
fear.
From
here
the
Cinnamon
Wind
sails
east,
to
make
the
trader’s
circle
round
the
Jade
Sea.”

“I
see,”
said
Dany,
disappointed.
“I
wish
you
fair
winds
and
good
trading,
then.
You
have
brought
me
a
precious
gift.”

“I
have
been
amply
repaid,
great
queen.”

She
puzzled
at
that.
“How
so?”

His
eyes
gleamed.
“I
have
seen
dragons.”

Dany
laughed.
“And
will
see
more
of
them
one
day,
I
hope.
Come
to
me
in
King’s
Landing
when
I
am
on
my
father’s
throne,
and
you
shall
have
a
great
reward.”

The
Summer
Islander
promised
he
would
do
so,
and
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
fingers
as
he
took
his
leave.
Jhiqui
showed
him
out,
while
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
remained.

“Khaleesi,”
the
knight
said
when
they
were
alone,
“I
should
not
speak
so
freely
of
your
plans,
if
I
were
you.
This
man
will
spread
the
tale
wherever
he
goes
now.”

“Let
him,”
she
said.
“Let
the
whole
world
know
my
purpose.
The
Usurper
is
dead,
what
does
it
matter?”

“Not
every
sailor’s
tale
is
true,”
Ser
Jorah
cautioned,
“and
even
if
Robert
be
truly
dead,
his
son
rules
in
his
place.
This
changes
nothing,
truly.”

“This
changes
everything.”
Dany
rose
abruptly.
Screeching,
her
dragons
uncoiled
and
spread
their
wings.
Drogon
flapped
and
clawed
up
to
the
lintel
over
the
archway.
The
others
skittered
across
the
floor,
wingtips
scrabbling
on
the
marble.
“Before,
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
like
my
Drogo’s
khalasar,
a
hundred
thousand
made
as
one
by
his
strength.
Now
they
fly
to
pieces,
even
as
the
khalasar
did
after
my
khal
lay
dead.”

“The
high
lords
have
always
fought.
Tell
me
who’s
won
and
I’ll
tell
you
what
it
means.
Khaleesi,
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
not
going
to
fall
into
your
hands
like
so
many
ripe
peaches.
You
will
need
a
fleet,
gold,
armies,
alliances—”

“All
this
I
know.”
She
took
his
hands
in
hers
and
looked
up
into
his
dark
suspicious
eyes.
Sometimes
he
thinks
of
me
as
a
child
he
must
protect,
and
sometimes
as
a
woman
he
would
like
to
bed,
but
does
he
ever
truly
see
me
as
his
queen?
“I
am
not
the
frightened
girl
you
met
in
Pentos.
I
have
counted
only
fifteen
name
days,
true…
but
I
am
as
old
as
the
crones
in
the
dosh
khaleen
and
as
young
as
my
dragons,
Jorah.
I
have
borne
a
child,
burned
a
khal,
and
crossed
the
red
waste
and
the
Dothraki
sea.
Mine
is
the
blood
of
the
dragon.”

“As
was
your
brother’s,”
he
said
stubbornly.

“I
am
not
Viserys.”

“No,”
he
admitted.
“There
is
more
of
Rhaegar
in
you,
I
think,
but
even
Rhaegar
could
be
slain.
Robert
proved
that
on
the
Trident,
with
no
more
than
a
warhammer.
Even
dragons
can
die.”

“Dragons
die.”
She
stood
on
her
toes
to
kiss
him
lightly
on
an
unshaven
cheek.
“But
so
do
dragonslayers.”





BRAN

Meera
moved
in
a
wary
circle,
her
net
dangling
loose
in
her
left
hand,
the
slender
three-pronged
frog
spear
poised
in
her
right.
Summer
followed
her
with
his
golden
eyes,
turning,
his
tail
held
stiff
and
tall.
Watching,
watching…

“Yai!”
the
girl
shouted,
the
spear
darting
out.
The
wolf
slid
to
the
left
and
leapt
before
she
could
draw
back
the
spear.
Meera
cast
her
net,
the
tangles
unfolding
in
the
air
before
her.
Summer’s
leap
carried
him
into
it.
He
dragged
it
with
him
as
he
slammed
into
her
chest
and
knocked
her
over
backward.
Her
spear
went
spinning
away.
The
damp
grass
cushioned
her
fall
but
the
breath
went
out
of
her
in
an
“Oof.”
The
wolf
crouched
atop
her.

Bran
hooted.
“You
lose.”

“She
wins,”
her
brother
Jojen
said.
“Summer’s
snared.”

He
was
right,
Bran
saw.
Thrashing
and
growling
at
the
net,
trying
to
rip
free,
Summer
was
only
ensnaring
himself
worse.
Nor
could
he
bite
through.
“Let
him
out.”

Laughing,
the
Reed
girl
threw
her
arms
around
the
tangled
wolf
and
rolled
them
both.
Summer
gave
a
piteous
whine,
his
legs
kicking
against
the
cords
that
bound
them.
Meera
knelt,
undid
a
twist,
pulled
at
a
corner,
tugged
deftly
here
and
there,
and
suddenly
the
direwolf
was
bounding
free.

“Summer,
to
me.”
Bran
spread
his
arms.
“Watch,”
he
said,
an
instant
before
the
wolf
bowled
into
him.
He
clung
with
all
his
strength
as
the
wolf
dragged
him
bumping
through
the
grass.
They
wrestled
and
rolled
and
clung
to
each
other,
one
snarling
and
yapping,
the
other
laughing.
In
the
end
it
was
Bran
sprawled
on
top,
the
mud-spattered
direwolf
under
him.
“Good
wolf,”
he
panted.
Summer
licked
him
across
the
ear.

Meera
shook
her
head.
“Does
he
never
grow
angry?”

“Not
with
me.”
Bran
grabbed
the
wolf
by
his
ears
and
Summer
snapped
at
him
fiercely,
but
it
was
all
in
play.
“Sometimes
he
tears
my
garb
but
he’s
never
drawn
blood.”

“Your
blood,
you
mean.
If
he’d
gotten
past
my
net…”

“He
wouldn’t
hurt
you.
He
knows
I
like
you.”
All
of
the
other
lords
and
knights
had
departed
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
harvest
feast,
but
the
Reeds
had
stayed
to
become
Bran’s
constant
companions.
Jojen
was
so
solemn
that
Old
Nan
called
him
“little
grandfather,”
but
Meera
reminded
Bran
of
his
sister
Arya.
She
wasn’t
scared
to
get
dirty,
and
she
could
run
and
fight
and
throw
as
good
as
a
boy.
She
was
older
than
Arya,
though;
almost
sixteen,
a
woman
grown.
They
were
both
older
than
Bran,
even
though
his
ninth
name
day
had
finally
come
and
gone,
but
they
never
treated
him
like
a
child.

“I
wish
you
were
our
wards
instead
of
the
Walders.”
He
began
to
struggle
toward
the
nearest
tree.
His
dragging
and
wriggling
was
unseemly
to
watch,
but
when
Meera
moved
to
lift
him
he
said,
“No,
don’t
help
me.”
He
rolled
clumsily
and
pushed
and
squirmed
backward,
using
the
strength
of
his
arms,
until
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
trunk
of
a
tall
ash.
“See,
I
told
you.”
Summer
lay
down
with
his
head
in
Bran’s
lap.
“I
never
knew
anyone
who
fought
with
a
net
before,”
he
told
Meera
while
he
scratched
the
direwolf
between
the
ears.
“Did
your
master-at-arms
teach
you
net-fighting?”

“My
father
taught
me.
We
have
no
knights
at
Greywater.
No
master-at-arms,
and
no
maester.”

“Who
keeps
your
ravens?”

She
smiled.
“Ravens
can’t
find
Greywater
Watch,
no
more
than
our
enemies
can.”

“Why
not?”

“Because
it
moves,”
she
told
him.

Bran
had
never
heard
of
a
moving
castle
before.
He
looked
at
her
uncertainly,
but
he
couldn’t
tell
whether
she
was
teasing
him
or
not.
“I
wish
I
could
see
it.
Do
you
think
your
lord
father
would
let
me
come
visit
when
the
war
is
over?”

“You
would
be
most
welcome,
my
prince.
Then
or
now.”

“Now?”
Bran
had
spent
his
whole
life
at
Winterfell.
He
yearned
to
see
far
places.
“I
could
ask
Ser
Rodrik
when
he
returns.”
The
old
knight
was
off
east,
trying
to
set
to
rights
the
trouble
there.
Roose
Bolton’s
bastard
had
started
it
by
seizing
Lady
Hornwood
as
she
returned
from
the
harvest
feast,
marrying
her
that
very
night
even
though
he
was
young
enough
to
be
her
son.
Then
Lord
Manderly
had
taken
her
castle.
To
protect
the
Hornwood
holdings
from
the
Boltons,
he
had
written,
but
Ser
Rodrik
had
been
almost
as
angry
with
him
as
with
the
bastard.
“Ser
Rodrik
might
let
me
go.
Maester
Luwin
never
would.”

Sitting
cross-legged
under
the
weirwood,
Jojen
Reed
regarded
him
solemnly.
“It
would
be
good
if
you
left
Winterfell,
Bran.”

“It
would?”

“Yes.
And
sooner
rather
than
later.”

“My
brother
has
the
greensight,”
said
Meera.
“He
dreams
things
that
haven’t
happened,
but
sometimes
they
do.”

“There
is
no
sometimes,
Meera.”
A
look
passed
between
them;
him
sad,
her
defiant.

“Tell
me
what’s
going
to
happen,”
Bran
said.

“I
will,”
said
Jojen,
“if
you’ll
tell
me
about
your
dreams.”

The
godswood
grew
quiet.
Bran
could
hear
leaves
rustling,
and
Hodor’s
distant
splashing
from
the
hot
pools.
He
thought
of
the
golden
man
and
the
three-eyed
crow,
remembered
the
crunch
of
bones
between
his
jaws
and
the
coppery
taste
of
blood.
“I
don’t
have
dreams.
Maester
Luwin
gives
me
sleeping
draughts.”

“Do
they
help?”

“Sometimes.”

Meera
said,
“All
of
Winterfell
knows
you
wake
at
night
shouting
and
sweating,
Bran.
The
women
talk
of
it
at
the
well,
and
the
guards
in
their
hall.”

“Tell
us
what
frightens
you
so
much,”
said
Jojen.

“I
don’t
want
to.
Anyway,
it’s
only
dreams.
Maester
Luwin
says
dreams
might
mean
anything
or
nothing.”

“My
brother
dreams
as
other
boys
do,
and
those
dreams
might
mean
anything,”
Meera
said,
“but
the
green
dreams
are
different.”

Jojen’s
eyes
were
the
color
of
moss,
and
sometimes
when
he
looked
at
you
he
seemed
to
be
seeing
something
else.
Like
now.
“I
dreamed
of
a
winged
wolf
bound
to
earth
with
grey
stone
chains,”
he
said.
“It
was
a
green
dream,
so
I
knew
it
was
true.
A
crow
was
trying
to
peck
through
the
chains,
but
the
stone
was
too
hard
and
his
beak
could
only
chip
at
them.”

“Did
the
crow
have
three
eyes?”

Jojen
nodded.

Summer
raised
his
head
from
Bran’s
lap,
and
gazed
at
the
mudman
with
his
dark
golden
eyes.

“When
I
was
little
I
almost
died
of
greywater
fever.
That
was
when
the
crow
came
to
me.”

“He
came
to
me
after
I
fell,”
Bran
blurted.
“I
was
asleep
for
a
long
time.
He
said
I
had
to
fly
or
die,
and
I
woke
up,
only
I
was
broken
and
I
couldn’t
fly
after
all.”

“You
can
if
you
want
to.”
Picking
up
her
net,
Meera
shook
out
the
last
tangles
and
began
arranging
it
in
loose
folds.

“You
are
the
winged
wolf,
Bran,”
said
Jojen.
“I
wasn’t
sure
when
we
first
came,
but
now
I
am.
The
crow
sent
us
here
to
break
your
chains.”

“Is
the
crow
at
Greywater?”

“No.
The
crow
is
in
the
north.”

“At
the
Wall?”
Bran
had
always
wanted
to
see
the
Wall.
His
bastard
brother
Jon
was
there
now,
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.

“Beyond
the
Wall.”
Meera
Reed
hung
the
net
from
her
belt.
“When
Jojen
told
our
lord
father
what
he’d
dreamed,
he
sent
us
to
Winterfell.”

“How
would
I
break
the
chains,
Jojen?”
Bran
asked.

“Open
your
eye.”

“They
are
open
Can’t
you
see?”

“Two
are
open.”
Jojen
pointed.
“One,
two.”

“I
only
have
two.”

“You
have
three.
The
crow
gave
you
the
third,
but
you
will
not
open
it.”
He
had
a
slow
soft
way
of
speaking.
“With
two
eyes
you
see
my
face.
With
three
you
could
see
my
heart.
With
two
you
can
see
that
oak
tree
there.
With
three
you
could
see
the
acorn
the
oak
grew
from
and
the
stump
that
it
will
one
day
become.
With
two
you
see
no
farther
than
your
walls.
With
three
you
would
gaze
south
to
the
Summer
Sea
and
north
beyond
the
Wall.”

Summer
got
to
his
feet.
“I
don’t
need
to
see
so
far.”
Bran
made
a
nervous
smile.
“I’m
tired
of
talking
about
crows.
Let’s
talk
about
wolves.
Or
lizard-lions.
Have
you
ever
hunted
one,
Meera?
We
don’t
have
them
here.”

Meera
plucked
her
frog
spear
out
of
the
bushes.
“They
live
in
the
water.
In
slow
streams
and
deep
swamps—”

Her
brother
interrupted.
“Did
you
dream
of
a
lizard-lion?”

“No,”
said
Bran.
“I
told
you,
I
don’t
want—”

“Did
you
dream
of
a
wolf?”

He
was
making
Bran
angry.
“I
don’t
have
to
tell
you
my
dreams.
I’m
the
prince.
I’m
the
Stark
in
Winterfell.”

“Was
it
Summer?”

“You
be
quiet.”

“The
night
of
the
harvest
feast,
you
dreamed
you
were
Summer
in
the
godswood,
didn’t
you?”

“Stop
it!”
Bran
shouted.
Summer
slid
toward
the
weirwood,
his
white
teeth
bared.

Jojen
Reed
took
no
mind.
“When
I
touched
Summer,
I
felt
you
in
him.
just
as
you
are
in
him
now.”

“You
couldn’t
have.
I
was
in
bed.
I
was
sleeping.”

“You
were
in
the
godswood,
all
in
grey.”

“It
was
only
a
bad
dream…”

Jojen
stood.
“I
felt
you.
I
felt
you
fall.
Is
that
what
scares
you,
the
falling?”

The
falling,
Bran
thought,
and
the
golden
man,
the
queen’s
brother,
he
scares
me
too,
but
mostly
the
falling.
He
did
not
say
it,
though.
How
could
he?
He
had
not
been
able
to
tell
Ser
Rodrik
or
Maester
Luwin,
and
he
could
not
tell
the
Reeds
either.
If
he
didn’t
talk
about
it,
maybe
he
would
forget.
He
had
never
wanted
to
remember.
It
might
not
even
be
a
true
remembering.

“Do
you
fall
every
night,
Bran?”
Joien
asked
quietly.

A
low
rumbling
growl
rose
from
Summer’s
throat,
and
there
was
no
play
in
it.
He
stalked
forward,
all
teeth
and
hot
eyes.
Meera
stepped
between
the
wolf
and
her
brother,
spear
in
hand.
“Keep
him
back,
Bran.”

“Jojen
is
making
him
angry.”

Meera
shook
out
her
net.

“It’s
your
anger,
Bran,”
her
brother
said.
“Your
fear.”

“It
isn’t.
I’m
not
a
wolf.”
Yet
he’d
howled
with
them
in
the
night,
and
tasted
blood
in
his
wolf
dreams.

“Part
of
you
is
Summer,
and
part
of
Summer
is
you.
You
know
that,
Bran.”

Summer
rushed
forward,
but
Meera
blocked
him,
jabbing
with
the
three-pronged
spear.
The
wolf
twisted
aside,
circling,
stalking.
Meera
turned
to
face
him.
“Call
him
back,
Bran.”

“Summer!”
Bran
shouted.
“To
me,
Summer!”
He
slapped
an
open
palm
down
on
the
meat
of
his
thigh.
His
hand
tingled,
though
his
dead
leg
felt
nothing.

The
direwolf
lunged
again,
and
again
Meera’s
spear
darted
out.
Summer
dodged,
circled
back.
The
bushes
rustled,
and
a
lean
black
shape
came
padding
from
behind
the
weirwood,
teeth
bared.
The
scent
was
strong;
his
brother
had
smelled
his
rage.
Bran
felt
hairs
rise
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
Meera
stood
beside
her
brother,
with
wolves
to
either
side.
“Bran,
call
them
off.”

“I
can’t!”

“Jojen,
up
the
tree.”

“There’s
no
need.
Today
is
not
the
day
I
die.”

“Do
it!”
she
screamed,
and
her
brother
scrambled
up
the
trunk
of
the
weirwood,
using
the
face
for
his
handholds.
The
direwolves
closed.
Meera
abandoned
spear
and
net,
jumped
up,
and
grabbed
the
branch
above
her
head.
Shaggy’s
jaws
snapped
shut
beneath
her
ankle
as
she
swung
up
and
over
the
limb.
Summer
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
howled,
while
Shaggydog
worried
the
net,
shaking
it
in
his
teeth.

Only
then
did
Bran
remember
that
they
were
not
alone.
He
cupped
hands
around
his
mouth.
“Hodor!”
he
shouted.
“Hodor!
Hodor!”
He
was
badly
frightened
and
somehow
ashamed.
“They
won’t
hurt
Hodor,”
he
assured
his
treed
friends.

A
few
moments
passed
before
they
heard
a
tuneless
humming.
Hodor
arrived
half-dressed
and
mud-spattered
from
his
visit
to
the
hot
pools,
but
Bran
had
never
been
so
glad
to
see
him.
“Hodor,
help
me.
Chase
off
the
wolves.
Chase
them
off.”

Hodor
went
to
it
gleefully,
waving
his
arms
and
stamping
his
huge
feet,
shouting
“Hodor,
Hodor,”
running
first
at
one
wolf
and
then
the
other.
Shaggydog
was
the
first
to
flee,
slinking
back
into
the
foliage
with
a
final
snarl.
When
Summer
had
enough,
he
came
back
to
Bran
and
lay
down
beside
him.

No
sooner
did
Meera
touch
ground
than
she
snatched
up
her
spear
and
net
again.
Jojen
never
took
his
eyes
off
Summer.
“We
will
talk
again,”
he
promised
Bran.

It
was
the
wolves,
it
wasn’t
me.
He
did
not
understand
why
they’d
gotten
so
wild.
Maybe
Maester
Luwin
was
right
to
lock
them
in
the
godswood.
“Hodor,”
he
said,
“bring
me
to
Maester
Luwin.”

The
maester’s
turret
below
the
rookery
was
one
of
Bran’s
favorite
places.
Luwin
was
hopelessly
untidy,
but
his
clutter
of
books
and
scrolls
and
bottles
was
as
familiar
and
comforting
to
Bran
as
his
bald
spot
and
the
flapping
sleeves
of
his
loose
grey
robes.
He
liked
the
ravens
too.

He
found
Luwin
perched
on
a
high
stool,
writing.
With
Ser
Rodrik
gone,
all
of
the
governance
of
the
castle
had
fallen
on
his
shoulders.
“My
prince,”
he
said
when
Hodor
entered,
“you’re
early
for
lessons
today.”
The
maester
spent
several
hours
every
afternoon
tutoring
Bran,
Rickon,
and
the
Walder
Freys.

“Hodor,
stand
still.”
Bran
grasped
a
wall
sconce
with
both
hands
and
used
it
to
pull
himself
up
and
out
of
the
basket.
He
hung
for
a
moment
by
his
arms
until
Hodor
carried
him
to
a
chair.
“Meera
says
her
brother
has
the
greensight.”

Maester
Luwin
scratched
at
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
writing
quill.
“Does
she
now?”

He
nodded.
“You
told
me
that
the
children
of
the
forest
had
the
greensight.
I
remember.”

“Some
claimed
to
have
that
power.
Their
wise
men
were
called
greenseers.”

“Was
it
magic?”

“Call
it
that
for
want
of
a
better
word,
if
you
must.
At
heart
it
was
only
a
different
sort
of
knowledge.”

“What
was
it?”

Luwin
set
down
his
quill.
“No
one
truly
knows,
Bran.
The
children
are
gone
from
the
world,
and
their
wisdom
with
them.
It
had
to
do
with
the
faces
in
the
trees,
we
think.
The
First
Men
believed
that
the
greenseers
could
see
through
the
eyes
of
the
weirwoods.
That
was
why
they
cut
down
the
trees
whenever
they
warred
upon
the
children.
Supposedly
the
greenseers
also
had
power
over
the
beasts
of
the
wood
and
the
birds
in
the
trees.
Even
fish.
Does
the
Reed
boy
claim
such
powers?”

“No.
I
don’t
think.
But
he
has
dreams
that
come
true
sometimes,
Meera
says.”

“All
of
us
have
dreams
that
come
true
sometimes.
You
dreamed
of
your
lord
father
in
the
crypts
before
we
knew
he
was
dead,
remember?”

“Rickon
did
too.
We
dreamed
the
same
dream.”

“Call
it
greensight,
if
you
wish…
but
remember
as
well
all
those
tens
of
thousands
of
dreams
that
you
and
Rickon
have
dreamed
that
did
not
come
true.
Do
you
perchance
recall
what
I
taught
you
about
the
chain
collar
that
every
maester
wears?”

Bran
thought
for
a
moment,
trying
to
remember.
“A
maester
forges
his
chain
in
the
Citadel
of
Oldtown.
It’s
a
chain
because
you
swear
to
serve,
and
it’s
made
of
different
metals
because
you
serve
the
realm
and
the
realm
has
different
sorts
of
people.
Every
time
you
learn
something
you
get
another
link.
Black
iron
is
for
ravenry,
silver
for
healing,
gold
for
sums
and
numbers.
I
don’t
remember
them
all.”

Luwin
slid
a
finger
up
under
his
collar
and
began
to
turn
it,
inch
by
inch.
He
had
a
thick
neck
for
a
small
man,
and
the
chain
was
tight,
but
a
few
pulls
had
it
all
the
way
around.
“This
is
Valyrian
steel,”
he
said
when
the
link
of
dark
grey
metal
lay
against
the
apple
of
his
throat.
“Only
one
maester
in
a
hundred
wears
such
a
link.
This
signifies
that
I
have
studied
what
the
Citadel
calls
the
higher
mysteries—magic,
for
want
of
a
better
word.
A
fascinating
pursuit,
but
of
small
use,
which
is
why
so
few
maesters
trouble
themselves
with
it.

“All
those
who
study
the
higher
mysteries
try
their
own
hand
at
spells,
soon
or
late.
I
yielded
to
the
temptation
too,
I
must
confess
it.
Well,
I
was
a
boy,
and
what
boy
does
not
secretly
wish
to
find
hidden
powers
in
himself?
I
got
no
more
for
my
efforts
than
a
thousand
boys
before
me,
and
a
thousand
since.
Sad
to
say,
magic
does
not
work.”

“Sometimes
it
does,”
Bran
protested.
“I
had
that
dream,
and
Rickon
did
too.
And
there
are
mages
and
warlocks
in
the
east…”

“There
are
men
who
call
themselves
mages
and
warlocks,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“I
had
a
friend
at
the
Citadel
who
could
pull
a
rose
out
of
your
ear,
but
he
was
no
more
magical
than
I
was.
Oh,
to
be
sure,
there
is
much
we
do
not
understand.
The
years
pass
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands,
and
what
does
any
man
see
of
life
but
a
few
summers,
a
few
winters?
We
look
at
mountains
and
call
them
eternal,
and
so
they
seem…
but
in
the
course
of
time,
mountains
rise
and
fall,
rivers
change
their
courses,
stars
fall
from
the
sky,
and
great
cities
sink
beneath
the
sea.
Even
gods
die,
we
think.
Everything
changes.

“Perhaps
magic
was
once
a
mighty
force
in
the
world,
but
no
longer.
What
little
remains
is
no
more
than
the
wisp
of
smoke
that
lingers
in
the
air
after
a
great
fire
has
burned
out,
and
even
that
is
fading.
Valyria
was
the
last
ember,
and
Valyria
is
gone.
The
dragons
are
no
more,
the
giants
are
dead,
the
children
of
the
forest
forgotten
with
all
their
lore.

“No,
my
prince.
Jojen
Reed
may
have
had
a
dream
or
two
that
he
believes
came
true,
but
he
does
not
have
the
greensight.
No
living
man
has
that
power.”

Bran
said
as
much
to
Meera
Reed
when
she
came
to
him
at
dusk
as
he
sat
in
his
window
seat
watching
the
lights
flicker
to
life.
“I’m
sorry
for
what
happened
with
the
wolves.
Summer
shouldn’t
have
tried
to
hurt
Jojen,
but
Jojen
shouldn’t
have
said
all
that
about
my
dreams.
The
crow
lied
when
he
said
I
could
fly,
and
your
brother
lied
too.”

“Or
perhaps
your
maester
is
wrong.”

“He
isn’t.
Even
my
father
relied
on
his
counsel.”

“Your
father
listened,
I
have
no
doubt.
But
in
the
end,
he
decided
for
himself.
Bran,
will
you
let
me
tell
you
about
a
dream
Jojen
dreamed
of
you
and
your
fosterling
brothers?”

“The
Walders
aren’t
my
brothers.”

She
paid
that
no
heed.
“You
were
sitting
at
supper,
but
instead
of
a
servant,
Maester
Luwin
brought
you
your
food.
He
served
you
the
king’s
cut
off
the
roast,
the
meat
rare
and
bloody,
but
with
a
savory
smell
that
made
everyone’s
mouth
water.
The
meat
he
served
the
Freys
was
old
and
grey
and
dead.
Yet
they
liked
their
supper
better
than
you
liked
yours.”

“I
don’t
understand.”

“You
will,
my
brother
says.
When
you
do,
we’ll
talk
again.”

Bran
was
almost
afraid
to
sit
to
supper
that
night,
but
when
he
did,
it
was
pigeon
pie
they
set
before
him.
Everyone
else
was
served
the
same,
and
he
couldn’t
see
that
anything
was
wrong
with
the
food
they
served
the
Walders.
Maester
Luwin
has
the
truth
of
it,
he
told
himself.
Nothing
bad
was
coming
to
Winterfell,
no
matter
what
Jojen
said.
Bran
was
relieved…
but
disappointed
too.
So
long
as
there
was
magic,
anything
could
happen.
Ghosts
could
walk,
trees
could
talk,
and
broken
boys
could
grow
up
to
be
knights.
“But
there
isn’t,”
he
said
aloud
in
the
darkness
of
his
bed.
“There’s
no
magic,
and
the
stories
are
just
stories.”

And
he
would
never
walk,
nor
fly,
nor
be
a
knight.





TYRION

The
rushes
were
scratchy
under
the
soles
of
his
bare
feet.
“My
cousin
chooses
a
queer
hour
to
come
visiting,”
Tyrion
told
a
sleep-befuddled
Podrick
Payne,
who’d
doubtless
expected
to
be
well
roasted
for
waking
him.
“See
him
to
my
solar
and
tell
him
I’ll
be
down
shortly.”

It
was
well
past
midnight,
he
judged
from
the
black
outside
the
window.
Does
Lancel
think
to
find
me
drowsy
and
slow
of
wit
at
this
hour?
he
wondered.
No,
Lancel
scarce
thinks
at
all,
this
is
Cersei’s
doing.
His
sister
would
be
disappointed.
Even
abed,
he
worked
well
into
the
morning—reading
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
candle,
scrutinizing
the
reports
of
Varys’s
whisperers,
and
poring
over
Littlefinger’s
books
of
accounts
until
the
columns
blurred
and
his
eyes
ached.

He
splashed
some
tepid
water
on
his
face
from
the
basin
beside
his
bed
and
took
his
time
squatting
in
the
garderobe,
the
night
air
cold
on
his
bare
skin.
Ser
Lancel
was
sixteen,
and
not
known
for
his
patience.
Let
him
wait,
and
grow
more
anxious
in
the
waiting.
When
his
bowels
were
empty,
Tyrion
slipped
on
a
bedrobe
and
roughed
his
thin
flaxen
hair
with
his
fingers,
all
the
more
to
look
as
if
he
had
wakened
from
sleep.

Lancel
was
pacing
before
the
ashes
of
the
hearth,
garbed
in
slashed
red
velvet
with
black
silk
undersleeves,
a
jeweled
dagger
and
a
gilded
scabbard
hanging
from
his
swordbelt.
“Cousin,”
Tyrion
greeted
him.
“Your
visits
are
too
few.
To
what
do
I
owe
this
undeserved
pleasure?”

“Her
Grace
the
Queen
Regent
has
sent
me
to
command
you
to
release
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.”
Ser
Lancel
showed
Tyrion
a
crimson
ribbon,
bearing
Cersei’s
lion
seal
impressed
in
golden
wax.
“Here
is
her
warrant.”

“So
it
is.”
Tyrion
waved
it
away.
“I
hope
my
sister
is
not
overtaxing
her
strength,
so
soon
after
her
illness.
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
she
were
to
suffer
a
relapse.”

“Her
Grace
is
quite
recovered,”
Ser
Lancel
said
curtly.

“Music
to
my
ears.”
Though
not
a
tune
I’m
fond
of.
I
should
have
given
her
a
larger
dose.
Tyrion
had
hoped
for
a
few
more
days
without
Cersei’s
interference,
but
he
was
not
too
terribly
surprised
by
her
return
to
health.
She
was
Jaime’s
twin,
after
all.
He
made
himself
smile
pleasantly.
“Pod,
build
us
a
fire,
the
air
is
too
chilly
for
my
taste.
Will
you
take
a
cup
with
me,
Lancel?
I
find
that
mulled
wine
helps
me
sleep.”

“I
need
no
help
sleeping,”
Ser
Lancel
said.
“I
am
come
at
Her
Grace’s
behest,
not
to
drink
with
you,
Imp.”

Knighthood
had
made
the
boy
bolder,
Tyrion
reflected—that,
and
the
sorry
part
he
had
played
in
murdering
King
Robert.
“Wine
does
have
its
dangers.”
He
smiled
as
he
poured.
“As
to
Grand
Maester
Pycelle…
if
my
sweet
sister
is
so
concerned
for
him,
I
would
have
thought
she’d
come
herself.
Instead
she
sends
you.
What
am
I
to
make
of
that?”

“Make
of
it
what
you
will,
so
long
as
you
release
your
prisoner.
The
Grand
Maester
is
a
staunch
friend
to
the
Queen
Regent,
and
under
her
personal
protection.”
A
hint
of
a
sneer
played
about
the
lad’s
lips;
he
was
enjoying
this.
He
takes
his
lessons
from
Cersei.
“Her
Grace
will
never
consent
to
this
outrage.
She
reminds
you
that
she
is
Joffrey’s
regent.”

“As
I
am
Joffrey’s
Hand.”

“The
Hand
serves,”
the
young
knight
informed
him
airily.
“The
regent
rules
until
the
king
is
of
age.”

“Perhaps
you
ought
write
that
down
so
I’ll
remember
it
better.”
The
fire
was
crackling
merrily.
“You
may
leave
us,
Pod,”
Tyrion
told
his
squire.
Only
when
the
boy
was
gone
did
he
turn
back
to
Lancel.
“There
is
more?”

“Yes.
Her
Grace
bids
me
inform
you
that
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
defied
a
command
issued
in
the
king’s
own
name.”

Which
means
that
Cersei
has
already
ordered
Bywater
to
release
Pycelle,
and
been
rebuffed.
“I
see.”

“She
insists
that
the
man
be
removed
from
his
office
and
placed
under
arrest
for
treason.
I
warn
you—”

He
set
aside
his
wine
cup.
“I’ll
hear
no
warnings
from
you,
boy.”

“Ser,”
Lancel
said
stiffly.
He
touched
his
sword,
perhaps
to
remind
Tyrion
that
he
wore
one.
“Have
a
care
how
you
speak
to
me,
Imp.”
Doubtless
he
meant
to
sound
threatening,
but
that
absurd
wisp
of
a
mustache
ruined
the
effect.

“Oh,
unhand
your
sword.
One
cry
from
me
and
Shagga
will
burst
in
and
kill
you.
With
an
axe,
not
a
wineskin.”

Lancel
reddened;
was
he
such
a
fool
as
to
believe
his
part
in
Robert’s
death
had
gone
unnoted?
“I
am
a
knight—”

“So
I’ve
noted.
Tell
me—did
Cersei
have
you
knighted
before
or
after
she
took
you
into
her
bed?”

The
flicker
in
Lancel’s
green
eyes
was
all
the
admission
Tyrion
needed.
So
Varys
told
it
true.
Well,
no
one
can
ever
claim
that
my
sister
does
not
love
her
family.
“What,
nothing
to
say?
No
more
warnings
for
me,
ser?”

“You
will
withdraw
these
filthy
accusations
or—”

“Please.
Have
you
given
any
thought
to
what
Joffrey
will
do
when
I
tell
him
you
murdered
his
father
to
bed
his
mother?”

“It
was
not
like
that!”
Lancel
protested,
horrified.

“No?
What
was
it
like,
pray?”

“The
queen
gave
me
the
strongwine!
Your
own
father
Lord
Tywin,
when
I
was
named
the
king’s
squire,
he
told
me
to
obey
her
in
everything.”

“Did
he
tell
you
to
fuck
her
too?”
Look
at
him.
Not
quite
so
tall,
his
features
not
so
fine,
and
his
hair
is
sand
instead
of
spun
gold,
yet
still…
even
a
poor
copy
of
Jaime
is
sweeter
than
an
empty
bed,
I
suppose.
“No,
I
thought
not.”

“I
never
meant…
I
only
did
as
I
was
bid,
I…”

“…hated
every
instant
of
it,
is
that
what
you
would
have
me
believe?
A
high
place
at
court,
knighthood,
my
sister’s
legs
opening
for
you
at
night,
oh,
yes,
it
must
have
been
terrible
for
you.”
Tyrion
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
“Wait
here.
His
Grace
will
want
to
hear
this.”

The
defiance
went
from
Lancel
all
at
once.
The
young
knight
fell
to
his
knees
a
frightened
boy.
“Mercy,
my
lord,
I
beg
you.”

“Save
it
for
Joffrey.
He
likes
a
good
beg.”

“My
lord,
it
was
your
sister’s
bidding,
the
queen,
as
you
said,
but
His
Grace…
he’d
never
understand…”

“Would
you
have
me
keep
the
truth
from
the
king?”

“For
my
father’s
sake!
I’ll
leave
the
city,
it
will
be
as
if
it
never
happened!
I
swear,
I
will
end
it…”

It
was
hard
not
to
laugh.
“I
think
not.”

Now
the
lad
looked
lost.
“My
lord?”

“You
heard
me.
My
father
told
you
to
obey
my
sister?
Very
well,
obey
her.
Stay
close
to
her
side,
keep
her
trust,
pleasure
her
as
often
as
she
requires
it.
No
one
need
ever
know…
so
long
as
you
keep
faith
with
me.
I
want
to
know
what
Cersei
is
doing.
Where
she
goes,
who
she
sees,
what
they
talk
of,
what
plans
she
is
hatching.
All.
And
you
will
be
the
one
to
tell
me,
won’t
you?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
Lancel
spoke
without
a
moment’s
hesitation.
Tyrion
liked
that.
“I
will.
I
swear
it.
As
you
command.”

“Rise.”
Tyrion
filled
the
second
cup
and
pressed
it
on
him.
“Drink
to
our
understanding.
I
promise,
there
are
no
boars
in
the
castle
that
I
know
of.”
Lancel
lifted
the
cup
and
drank,
albeit
stiffly.
“Smile,
cousin.
My
sister
is
a
beautiful
woman,
and
it’s
all
for
the
good
of
the
realm.
You
could
do
well
out
of
this.
Knighthood
is
nothing.
If
you’re
clever,
you’ll
have
a
lordship
from
me
before
you’re
done.”
Tyrion
swirled
the
wine
in
his
cup.
“We
want
Cersei
to
have
every
faith
in
you.
Go
back
and
tell
her
I
beg
her
forgiveness.
Tell
her
that
you
frightened
me,
that
I
want
no
conflict
between
us,
that
henceforth
I
shall
do
nothing
without
her
consent.”

“But…
her
demands…”

“Oh,
I’ll
give
her
Pycelle.”

“You
will?”
Lancel
seemed
astonished.

Tyrion
smiled.
“I’ll
release
him
on
the
morrow.
I
could
swear
that
I
hadn’t
harmed
a
hair
on
his
head,
but
it
wouldn’t
be
strictly
true.
In
any
case,
he’s
well
enough,
though
I
won’t
vouch
for
his
vigor.
The
black
cells
are
not
a
healthy
place
for
a
man
his
age.
Cersei
can
keep
him
as
a
pet
or
send
him
to
the
Wall,
I
don’t
care
which,
but
I
won’t
have
him
on
the
council.”

“And
Ser
Jacelyn?”

“Tell
my
sister
you
believe
you
can
win
him
away
from
me,
given
time.
That
ought
to
content
her
for
a
while.”

“As
you
say.”
Lancel
finished
his
wine.

“One
last
thing.
With
King
Robert
dead,
it
would
be
most
embarrassing
should
his
grieving
widow
suddenly
grow
great
with
child.”

“My
lord,
I…
we…
the
queen
has
commanded
me
not
to…”
His
ears
had
turned
Lannister
crimson.
“I
spill
my
seed
on
her
belly,
my
lord.”

“A
lovely
belly,
I
have
no
doubt.
Moisten
it
as
often
as
you
wish…
but
see
that
your
dew
falls
nowhere
else.
I
want
no
more
nephews,
is
that
clear?”

Ser
Lancel
made
a
stiff
bow
and
took
his
leave.

Tyrion
allowed
himself
a
moment
to
feel
sorry
for
the
boy.
Another
fool,
and
a
weakling
as
well,
but
he
does
not
deserve
what
Cersei
and
I
are
doing
to
him.
It
was
a
kindness
that
his
uncle
Kevan
had
two
other
sons;
this
one
was
unlikely
to
live
out
the
year.
Cersei
would
have
him
killed
out
of
hand
if
she
learned
he
was
betraying
her,
and
if
by
some
grace
of
the
gods
she
did
not,
Lancel
would
never
survive
the
day
Jaime
Lannister
returned
to
King’s
Landing.
The
only
question
would
be
whether
Jaime
cut
him
down
in
a
jealous
rage,
or
Cersei
murdered
him
first
to
keep
Jaime
from
finding
out.
Tyrion’s
silver
was
on
Cersei.

A
restlessness
was
on
him,
and
Tyrion
knew
full
well
he
would
not
get
back
to
sleep
tonight.
Not
here,
in
any
case.
He
found
Podrick
Payne
asleep
in
a
chair
outside
the
door
of
the
solar,
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder.
“Summon
Bronn,
and
then
run
down
to
the
stables
and
have
two
horses
saddled.”

The
squire’s
eyes
were
cloudy
with
sleep.
“Horses.”

“Those
big
brown
animals
that
love
apples,
I’m
sure
you’ve
seen
them.
Four
legs
and
a
tail.
But
Bronn
first.”

The
sellsword
was
not
long
in
appearing.
“Who
pissed
in
your
soup?”
he
demanded.

“Cersei,
as
ever.
You’d
think
I’d
be
used
to
the
taste
by
now,
but
never
mind.
My
gentle
sister
seems
to
have
mistaken
me
for
Ned
Stark.”

“I
hear
he
was
taller.”

“Not
after
Joff
took
off
his
head.
You
ought
to
have
dressed
more
warmly,
the
night
is
chill.”

“Are
we
going
somewhere?”

“Are
all
sellswords
as
clever
as
you?”

The
city
streets
were
dangerous,
but
with
Bronn
beside
him
Tyrion
felt
safe
enough.
The
guards
let
him
out
a
postern
gate
in
the
north
wall,
and
they
rode
down
Shadowblack
Lane
to
the
foot
of
Aegon’s
High
Hill,
and
thence
onto
Pigrun
Alley,
past
rows
of
shuttered
windows
and
tall
timber-and-stone
buildings
whose
upper
stories
leaned
out
so
far
over
the
street
they
almost
kissed.
The
moon
seemed
to
follow
them
as
they
went,
playing
peek-and-sneak
among
the
chimneys.
They
encountered
no
one
but
a
lone
old
crone,
carrying
a
dead
cat
by
the
tail.
She
gave
them
a
fearful
look,
as
if
she
were
afraid
they
might
try
to
steal
her
dinner,
and
slunk
off
into
the
shadows
without
a
word.

Tyrion
reflected
on
the
men
who
had
been
Hand
before
him,
who
had
proved
no
match
for
his
sister’s
wiles.
How
could
they
be?
Men
like
that…
too
honest
to
live,
too
noble
to
shit,
Cersei
devours
such
fools
every
morning
when
she
breaks
her
fast.
The
only
way
to
defeat
my
sister
is
to
play
her
own
game,
and
that
was
something
the
Lords
Stark
and
Arryn
would
never
do.
Small
wonder
that
both
of
them
were
dead,
while
Tyrion
Lannister
had
never
felt
more
alive.
His
stunted
legs
might
make
him
a
comic
grotesque
at
a
harvest
ball,
but
this
dance
he
knew.

Despite
the
hour,
the
brothel
was
crowded.
Chataya
greeted
them
pleasantly
and
escorted
them
to
the
common
room.
Bronn
went
upstairs
with
a
dark-eyed
girl
from
Dorne,
but
Alayaya
was
busy
entertaining.
“She
will
be
so
pleased
to
know
you’ve
come,”
said
Chataya.
“I
will
see
that
the
turret
room
is
made
ready
for
you.
Will
my
lord
take
a
cup
of
wine
while
he
waits?”

“I
will,”
he
said.

The
wine
was
poor
stuff
compared
to
the
vintages
from
the
Arbor
the
house
normally
served.
“You
must
forgive
us,
my
lord,”
Chataya
said.
“I
cannot
find
good
wine
at
any
price
of
late.”

“You
are
not
alone
in
that,
I
fear.”

Chataya
commiserated
with
him
a
moment,
then
excused
herself
and
glided
off.
A
handsome
woman,
Tyrion
reflected
as
he
watched
her
go.
He
had
seldom
seen
such
elegance
and
dignity
in
a
whore.
Though
to
be
sure,
she
saw
herself
more
as
a
kind
of
priestess.
Perhaps
that
is
the
secret.
It
is
not
what
we
do,
so
much
as
why
we
do
it.
Somehow
that
thought
comforted
him.

A
few
of
the
other
patrons
were
giving
him
sideways
looks.
The
last
time
he
ventured
out,
a
man
had
spit
on
him…
well,
had
tried
to.
Instead
he’d
spit
on
Bronn,
and
in
future
would
do
his
spitting
without
teeth.

“Is
milord
feeling
unloved?”
Dancy
slid
into
his
lap
and
nibbled
at
his
ear.
“I
have
a
cure
for
that.”

Smiling,
Tyrion
shook
his
head.
“You
are
too
beautiful
for
words,
sweetling,
but
I’ve
grown
fond
of
Alayaya’s
remedy.”

“You’ve
never
tried
mine.
Milord
never
chooses
anyone
but
’Yaya.
She’s
good
but
I’m
better,
don’t
you
want
to
see?”

“Next
time,
perhaps.”
Tyrion
had
no
doubt
that
Dancy
would
be
a
lively
handful.
She
was
pug-nosed
and
bouncy,
with
freckles
and
a
mane
of
thick
red
hair
that
tumbled
down
past
her
waist.
But
he
had
Shae
waiting
for
him
at
the
manse.

Giggling,
she
put
her
hand
between
his
thighs
and
squeezed
him
through
his
breeches.
“I
don’t
think
he
wants
to
wait
till
next
time,”
she
announced.
“He
wants
to
come
out
and
count
all
my
freckles,
I
think.”

“Dancy.”
Alayaya
stood
in
the
doorway,
dark
and
cool
in
gauzy
green
silk.
“His
lordship
is
come
to
visit
me.”

Tyrion
gently
disentangled
himself
from
the
other
girl
and
stood.
Dancy
did
not
seem
to
mind.
“Next
time,”
she
reminded
him.
She
put
a
finger
in
her
mouth
and
sucked
it.

As
the
black-skinned
girl
led
him
up
the
stairs,
she
said,
“Poor
Dancy.
She
has
a
fortnight
to
get
my
lord
to
choose
her.
Elsewise
she
loses
her
black
pearls
to
Marei.”

Marei
was
a
cool,
pale,
delicate
girl
Tyrion
had
noticed
once
or
twice.
Green
eyes
and
porcelain
skin,
long
straight
silvery
hair,
very
lovely,
but
too
solemn
by
half.
“I’d
hate
to
have
the
poor
child
lose
her
pearls
on
account
of
me.”

“Then
take
her
upstairs
next
time.”

“Maybe
I
will.”

She
smiled.
“I
think
not,
my
lord.”

She’s
right,
Tyrion
thought,
I
won’t.
Shae
may
be
only
a
whore,
but
I
am
faithful
to
her
after
my
fashion.

In
the
turret
room,
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
wardrobe,
he
looked
at
Alayaya
curiously.
“What
do
you
do
while
I’m
gone?”

She
raised
her
arms
and
stretched
like
some
sleek
black
cat.
“Sleep.
I
am
much
better
rested
since
you
began
to
visit
us,
my
lord.
And
Marei
is
teaching
us
to
read,
perhaps
soon
I
will
be
able
to
pass
the
time
with
a
book.”

“Sleep
is
good,”
he
said.
“And
books
are
better.”
He
gave
her
a
quick
kiss
on
the
cheek.
Then
it
was
down
the
shaft
and
through
the
tunnel.

As
he
left
the
stable
on
his
piebald
gelding,
Tyrion
heard
the
sound
of
music
drifting
over
the
rooftops.
It
was
pleasant
to
think
that
men
still
sang,
even
in
the
midst
of
butchery
and
famine.
Remembered
notes
filled
his
head,
and
for
a
moment
he
could
almost
hear
Tysha
as
she’d
sung
to
him
half
a
lifetime
ago.
He
reined
up
to
listen.
The
tune
was
wrong,
the
words
too
faint
to
hear.
A
different
song
then,
and
why
not?
His
sweet
innocent
Tysha
had
been
a
lie
start
to
finish,
only
a
whore
his
brother
Jaime
had
hired
to
make
him
a
man.

I’m
free
of
Tysha
now,
he
thought.
She’s
haunted
me
half
my
life,
but
I
don’t
need
her
anymore,
no
more
than
I
need
Alayaya
or
Dancy
or
Marei,
or
the
hundreds
like
them
I’ve
bedded
with
over
the
years.
I
have
Shae
now.
Shae.

The
gates
of
the
manse
were
closed
and
barred.
Tyrion
pounded
until
the
ornate
bronze
eye
clacked
open.
“It’s
me.”
The
man
who
admitted
him
was
one
of
Varys’s
prettier
finds,
a
Braavosi
daggerman
with
a
harelip
and
a
lazy
eye.
Tyrion
had
wanted
no
handsome
young
guardsmen
loitering
about
Shae
day
after
day.
“Find
me
old,
ugly,
scarred
men,
preferably
impotent,”
he
had
told
the
eunuch.
“Men
who
prefer
boys.
Or
men
who
prefer
sheep,
for
that
matter.”
Varys
had
not
managed
to
come
up
with
any
sheeplovers,
but
he
did
find
a
eunuch
strangler
and
a
pair
of
foulsmelling
Ibbenese
who
were
as
fond
of
axes
as
they
were
of
each
other.
The
others
were
as
choice
a
lot
of
mercenaries
as
ever
graced
a
dungeon,
each
uglier
than
the
last.
When
Varys
had
paraded
them
before
him,
Tyrion
had
been
afraid
he’d
gone
too
far,
but
Shae
had
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint.
And
why
would
she?
She
has
never
complained
of
me,
and
I’m
more
hideous
than
all
her
guards
together.
Perhaps
she
does
not
even
see
ugliness.

Even
so,
Tyrion
would
sooner
have
used
some
of
his
mountain
clansmen
to
guard
the
manse;
Chella’s
Black
Ears
perhaps,
or
the
Moon
Brothers.
He
had
more
faith
in
their
iron
loyalties
and
sense
of
honor
than
in
the
greed
of
sellswords.
The
risk
was
too
great,
however.
All
King’s
Landing
knew
the
wildlings
were
his.
If
he
sent
the
Black
Ears
here,
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
until
the
whole
city
knew
the
King’s
Hand
was
keeping
a
concubine.

One
of
the
Ibbenese
took
his
horse.
“Have
you
woken
her?”
Tyrion
asked
him.

“No,
m’lord.”

“Good.”

The
fire
in
the
bedchamber
had
burned
down
to
embers,
but
the
room
was
still
warm.
Shae
had
kicked
off
her
blankets
and
sheets
as
she
slept.
She
lay
nude
atop
the
featherbed,
the
soft
curves
of
her
young
body
limned
in
the
faint
glow
from
the
hearth.
Tyrion
stood
in
the
door
and
drank
in
the
sight
of
her.
Younger
than
Marei,
sweeter
than
Dancy,
more
beautiful
than
Alayaya,
she’s
all
I
need
and
more.
How
could
a
whore
look
so
clean
and
sweet
and
innocent,
he
wondered?

He
had
not
intended
to
disturb
her,
but
the
sight
of
her
was
enough
to
make
him
hard.
He
let
his
garments
fall
to
the
floor,
then
crawled
onto
the
bed
and
gently
pushed
her
legs
apart
and
kissed
her
between
the
thighs.
Shae
murmured
in
her
sleep.
He
kissed
her
again,
and
licked
at
her
secret
sweetness,
on
and
on
until
his
beard
and
her
cunt
were
both
soaked.
When
she
gave
a
soft
moan
and
shuddered,
he
climbed
up
and
thrust
himself
inside
her
and
exploded
almost
at
once.

Her
eyes
were
open.
She
smiled
and
stroked
his
head
and
whispered,
“I
just
had
the
sweetest
dream,
m’lord.”

Tyrion
nipped
at
her
small
hard
nipple
and
nestled
his
head
on
her
shoulder.
He
did
not
pull
out
of
her;
would
that
he
never
had
to
pull
out
of
her.
“This
is
no
dream,”
he
promised
her.
It
is
real,
all
of
it,
he
thought,
the
wars,
the
intrigues,
the
great
bloody
game,
and
me
in
the
center
of
it…
me,
the
dwarf,
the
monster,
the
one
they
scorned
and
laughed
at,
but
now
I
hold
it
all,
the
power,
the
city,
the
girl.
This
was
what
I
was
made
for,
and
gods
forgive
me,
but
I
do
love
it…

And
her.
And
her.





ARYA

Whatever
names
Harren
the
Black
had
meant
to
give
his
towers
were
long
forgotten.
They
were
called
the
Tower
of
Dread,
the
Widow’s
Tower,
the
Wailing
Tower,
the
Tower
of
Ghosts,
and
Kingspyre
Tower.
Arya
slept
in
a
shallow
niche
in
the
cavernous
vaults
beneath
the
Wailing
Tower,
on
a
bed
of
straw.
She
had
water
to
wash
in
whenever
she
liked,
a
chunk
of
soap.
The
work
was
hard,
but
no
harder
than
walking
miles
every
day.
Weasel
did
not
need
to
find
worms
and
bugs
to
eat,
as
Arry
had;
there
was
bread
every
day,
and
barley
stews
with
bits
of
carrot
and
turnip,
and
once
a
fortnight
even
a
bite
of
meat.

Hot
Pie
ate
even
better;
he
was
where
he
belonged,
in
the
kitchens,
a
round
stone
building
with
a
domed
roof
that
was
a
world
unto
itself.
Arya
took
her
meals
at
a
trestle
table
in
the
undercroft
with
Weese
and
his
other
charges,
but
sometimes
she
would
be
chosen
to
help
fetch
their
food,
and
she
and
Hot
Pie
could
steal
a
moment
to
talk.
He
could
never
remember
that
she
was
now
Weasel
and
kept
calling
her
Arry,
even
though
he
knew
she
was
a
girl.
Once
he
tried
to
slip
her
a
hot
apple
tart,
but
he
made
such
a
clumsy
job
of
it
that
two
of
the
cooks
saw.
They
took
the
tart
away
and
beat
him
with
a
big
wooden
spoon.

Gendry
had
been
sent
to
the
forge;
Arya
seldom
saw
him.
As
for
those
she
served
with,
she
did
not
even
want
to
know
their
names.
That
only
made
it
hurt
worse
when
they
died.
Most
of
them
were
older
than
she
was
and
content
to
let
her
alone.

Harrenhal
was
vast,
much
of
it
far
gone
in
decay.
Lady
Whent
had
held
the
castle
as
bannerman
to
House
Tully,
but
she’d
used
only
the
lower
thirds
of
two
of
the
five
towers,
and
let
the
rest
go
to
ruin.
Now
she
was
fled,
and
the
small
household
she’d
left
could
not
begin
to
tend
the
needs
of
all
the
knights,
lords,
and
highborn
prisoners
Lord
Tywin
had
brought,
so
the
Lannisters
must
forage
for
servants
as
well
as
for
plunder
and
provender.
The
talk
was
that
Lord
Tywin
planned
to
restore
Harrenhal
to
glory,
and
make
it
his
new
seat
once
the
war
was
done.

Weese
used
Arya
to
run
messages,
draw
water,
and
fetch
food,
and
sometimes
to
serve
at
table
in
the
Barracks
Hall
above
the
armory,
where
the
men-at-arms
took
their
meals.
But
most
of
her
work
was
cleaning.
The
ground
floor
of
the
Wailing
Tower
was
given
over
to
storerooms
and
granaries,
and
two
floors
above
housed
part
of
the
garrison,
but
the
upper
stories
had
not
been
occupied
for
eighty
years.
Now
Lord
Tywin
had
commanded
that
they
be
made
fit
for
habitation
again.
There
were
floors
to
be
scrubbed,
grime
to
be
washed
off
windows,
broken
chairs
and
rotted
beds
to
be
carried
off.
The
topmost
story
was
infested
with
nests
of
the
huge
black
bats
that
House
Whent
had
used
for
its
sigil,
and
there
were
rats
in
the
cellars
as
well…
and
ghosts,
some
said,
the
spirits
of
Harren
the
Black
and
his
sons.

Arya
thought
that
was
stupid.
Harren
and
his
sons
had
died
in
Kingspyre
Tower,
that
was
why
it
had
that
name,
so
why
should
they
cross
the
yard
to
haunt
her?
The
Wailing
Tower
only
wailed
when
the
wind
blew
from
the
north,
and
that
was
just
the
sound
the
air
made
blowing
through
the
cracks
in
the
stones
where
they
had
fissured
from
the
heat.
if
there
were
ghosts
in
Harrenhal,
they
never
troubled
her.
It
was
the
living
men
she
feared,
Weese
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
and
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
himself,
who
kept
his
apartments
in
Kingspyre
Tower,
still
the
tallest
and
mightiest
of
all,
though
lopsided
beneath
the
weight
of
the
slagged
stone
that
made
it
look
like
some
giant
half-melted
black
candle.

She
wondered
what
Lord
Tywin
would
do
if
she
marched
up
to
him
and
confessed
to
being
Arya
Stark,
but
she
knew
she’d
never
get
near
enough
to
talk
to
him,
and
anyhow
he’d
never
believe
her
if
she
did,
and
afterward
Weese
would
beat
her
bloody.

In
his
own
small
strutting
way,
Weese
was
nearly
as
scary
as
Ser
Gregor.
The
Mountain
swatted
men
like
flies,
but
most
of
the
time
he
did
not
even
seem
to
know
the
fly
was
there.
Weese
always
knew
you
were
there,
and
what
you
were
doing,
and
sometimes
what
you
were
thinking.
He
would
hit
at
the
slightest
provocation,
and
he
had
a
dog
who
was
near
as
bad
as
he
was,
an
ugly
spotted
bitch
that
smelled
worse
than
any
dog
Arya
had
ever
known.
Once
she
saw
him
set
the
dog
on
a
latrine
boy
who’d
annoyed
him.
She
tore
a
big
chunk
out
of
the
boy’s
calf
while
Weese
laughed.

It
took
him
only
three
days
to
earn
the
place
of
honor
in
her
nightly
prayers.
“Weese,”
she
would
whisper,
first
of
all.
“Dunsen,
Chiswyck,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.”
If
she
let
herself
forget
even
one
of
them,
how
would
she
ever
find
him
again
to
kill
him?

On
the
road
Arya
had
felt
like
a
sheep,
but
Harrenbal
turned
her
into
a
mouse.
She
was
grey
as
a
mouse
in
her
scratchy
wool
shift,
and
like
a
mouse
she
kept
to
the
crannies
and
crevices
and
dark
holes
of
the
castle,
scurrying
out
of
the
way
of
the
mighty.

Sometimes
she
thought
they
were
all
mice
within
those
thick
walls,
even
the
knights
and
the
great
lords.
The
size
of
the
castle
made
even
Gregor
Clegane
seem
small.
Harrenhal
covered
thrice
as
much
ground
as
Winterfell,
and
its
buildings
were
so
much
larger
they
could
scarcely
be
compared.
Its
stables
housed
a
thousand
horses,
its
godswood
covered
twenty
acres,
its
kitchens
were
as
large
as
Winterfell’s
Great
Hall,
and
its
own
great
hall,
grandly
named
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths
even
though
it
only
had
thirty
and
some
(Arya
had
tried
to
count
them,
twice,
but
she
came
up
with
thirty-three
once
and
thirty-five
the
other
time)
was
so
cavernous
that
Lord
Tywin
could
have
feasted
his
entire
host,
though
he
never
did.
Walls,
doors,
halls,
steps,
everything
was
built
to
an
inhuman
scale
that
made
Arya
remember
the
stories
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
of
the
giants
who
lived
beyond
the
Wall.

And
as
lords
and
ladies
never
notice
the
little
grey
mice
under
their
feet,
Arya
heard
all
sorts
of
secrets
just
by
keeping
her
ears
open
as
she
went
about
her
duties.
Pretty
Pia
from
the
buttery
was
a
slut
who
was
working
her
way
through
every
knight
in
the
castle.
The
wife
of
the
gaoler
was
with
child,
but
the
real
father
was
either
Ser
Alyn
Stackspear
or
a
singer
called
Whitesmile
Wat.
Lord
Lefford
made
mock
of
ghosts
at
table,
but
always
kept
a
candle
burning
by
his
bed.
Ser
Dunaver’s
squire
Jodge
could
not
hold
his
water
when
he
slept.
The
cooks
despised
Ser
Harys
Swyft
and
spit
in
all
his
food.
once
she
even
overheard
Maester
Tothmure’s
serving
girl
confiding
to
her
brother
about
some
message
that
said
Joffrey
was
a
bastard
and
not
the
rightful
king
at
all.
“Lord
Tywin
told
him
to
burn
the
letter
and
never
speak
such
filth
again,”
the
girl
whispered.

King
Robert’s
brothers
Stannis
and
Renly
had
joined
the
fighting,
she
heard.
“And
both
of
them
kings
now,”
Weese
said.
“Realm’s
got
more
kings
than
a
castle’s
got
rats.”
Even
Lannister
men
questioned
how
long
Joffrey
would
hold
the
Iron
Throne.
“The
lad’s
got
no
army
but
them
gold
cloaks,
and
he’s
ruled
by
a
eunuch,
a
dwarf,
and
a
woman,”
she
heard
a
lordling
mutter
in
his
cups.
“What
good
will
the
likes
of
them
be
if
it
comes
to
battle?”
There
was
always
talk
of
Beric
Dondarrion.
A
fat
archer
once
said
the
Bloody
Mummers
had
slain
him,
but
the
others
only
laughed.
“Lorch
killed
the
man
at
Rushing
Falls,
and
the
Mountain’s
slain
him
twice.
Got
me
a
silver
stag
says
he
don’t
stay
dead
this
time
neither.”

Arya
did
not
know
who
Bloody
Mummers
were
until
a
fortnight
later,
when
the
queerest
company
of
men
she’d
ever
seen
arrived
at
Harrenhal.
Beneath
the
standard
of
a
black
goat
with
bloody
horns
rode
copper
men
with
bells
in
their
braids;
lancers
astride
striped
black-and-white
horses;
bowmen
with
powdered
cheeks;
squat
hairy
men
with
shaggy
shields;
brown-skinned
men
in
feathered
cloaks;
a
wispy
fool
in
green-and-pink
motley;
swordsmen
with
fantastic
forked
beards
dyed
green
and
purple
and
silver;
spearmen
with
colored
scars
that
covered
their
cheeks;
a
slender
man
in
septon’s
robes,
a
fatherly
one
in
maester’s
grey,
and
a
sickly
one
whose
leather
cloak
was
fringed
with
long
blond
hair.

At
their
head
was
a
man
stick-thin
and
very
tall,
with
a
drawn
emaciated
face
made
even
longer
by
the
ropy
black
beard
that
grew
from
his
pointed
chin
nearly
to
his
waist.
The
helm
that
hung
from
his
saddle
horn
was
black
steel,
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
a
goat’s
head.
About
his
neck
he
wore
a
chain
made
of
linked
coins
of
many
different
sizes,
shapes,
and
metals,
and
his
horse
was
one
of
the
strange
black-and-white
ones.

“You
don’t
want
to
know
that
lot,
Weasel,”
Weese
said
when
he
saw
her
looking
at
the
goat-helmed
man.
Two
of
his
drinking
friends
were
with
him,
men-at-arms
in
service
to
Lord
Lefford.

“Who
are
they?”
she
asked.

One
of
the
soldiers
laughed.
“The
Footmen,
girl.
Toes
of
the
Goat.
Lord
Tywin’s
Bloody
Mummers.”

“Pease
for
wits.
You
get
her
flayed,
you
can
scrub
the
bloody
steps,”
said
Weese.
“They’re
sellswords,
Weasel
girl.
Call
themselves
the
Brave
Companions.
Don’t
use
them
other
names
where
they
can
hear,
or
they’ll
hurt
you
bad.
The
goat-helm’s
their
captain,
Lord
Vargo
Hoat.”

“He’s
no
fucking
lord,”
said
the
second
soldier.
“I
heard
Ser
Amory
say
so.
He’s
just
some
sellsword
with
a
mouth
full
of
slobber
and
a
high
opinion
of
hisself.”

“Aye,”
said
Weese,
“but
she
better
call
him
lord
if
she
wants
to
keep
all
her
parts.”

Arya
looked
at
Vargo
Hoat
again.
How
many
monsters
does
Lord
Tywin
have?

The
Brave
Companions
were
housed
in
the
Widow’s
Tower,
so
Arya
need
not
serve
them.
She
was
glad
of
that;
on
the
very
night
they
arrived,
fighting
broke
out
between
the
sellswords
and
some
Lannister
men.
Ser
Harys
Swyft’s
squire
was
stabbed
to
death
and
two
of
the
Bloody
Mummers
were
wounded.
The
next
morning
Lord
Tywin
hanged
them
both
from
the
gatehouse
walls,
along
with
one
of
Lord
Lydden’s
archers.
Weese
said
the
archer
had
started
all
the
trouble
by
taunting
the
sellswords
over
Beric
Dondarrion.
After
the
hanged
men
had
stopped
kicking,
Vargo
Hoat
and
Ser
Harys
embraced
and
kissed
and
swore
to
love
each
other
always
as
Lord
Tywin
looked
on.
Arya
thought
it
was
funny
the
way
Vargo
Hoat
lisped
and
slobbered,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
laugh.

The
Bloody
Mummers
did
not
linger
long
at
Harrenhal,
but
before
they
rode
out
again,
Arya
heard
one
of
them
saying
how
a
northern
army
under
Roose
Bolton
had
occupied
the
ruby
ford
of
the
Trident.
“If
he
crosses,
Lord
Tywin
will
smash
him
again
like
he
did
on
the
Green
Fork,”
a
Lannister
bowmen
said,
but
his
fellows
jeered
him
down.
“Bolton’ll
never
cross,
not
till
the
Young
Wolf
marches
from
Riverrun
with
his
wild
northmen
and
all
them
wolves.”

Arya
had
not
known
her
brother
was
so
near.
Riverrun
was
much
closer
than
Winterfell,
though
she
was
not
certain
where
it
lay
in
relation
to
Harrenhal.
I
could
find
out
somehow,
I
know
I
could,
if
only
I
could
get
away.
When
she
thought
of
seeing
Robb’s
face
again
Arya
had
to
bite
her
lip.
And
I
want
to
see
Jon
too,
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
and
Mother.
Even
Sansa…
I’ll
kiss
her
and
beg
her
pardons
like
a
proper
lady,
she’ll
like
that.

From
the
courtyard
talk
she’d
learned
that
the
upper
chambers
of
the
Tower
of
Dread
housed
three
dozen
captives
taken
during
some
battle
on
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Most
had
been
given
freedom
of
the
castle
in
return
for
their
pledge
not
to
attempt
escape.
They
vowed
not
to
escape,
Arya
told
herself,
but
they
never
swore
not
to
help
me
escape.

The
captives
ate
at
their
own
table
in
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths,
and
could
often
be
seen
about
the
grounds.
Four
brothers
took
their
exercise
together
every
day,
fighting
with
staves
and
wooden
shields
in
the
Flowstone
Yard.
Three
of
them
were
Freys
of
the
Crossing,
the
fourth
their
bastard
brother.
They
were
only
there
a
short
time,
though;
one
morning
two
other
brothers
arrived
under
a
peace
banner
with
a
chest
of
gold,
and
ransomed
them
from
the
knights
who’d
captured
them.
The
six
Freys
all
left
together.

No
one
ransomed
the
northmen,
though.
One
fat
lordling
haunted
the
kitchens,
Hot
Pie
told
her,
always
looking
for
a
morsel.
His
mustache
was
so
bushy
that
it
covered
his
mouth,
and
the
clasp
that
held
his
cloak
was
a
silver-and-sapphire
trident.
He
belonged
to
Lord
Tywin,
but
the
fierce,
bearded
young
man
who
liked
to
walk
the
battlements
alone
in
a
black
cloak
patterned
with
white
suns
had
been
taken
by
some
hedge
knight
who
meant
to
get
rich
off
him.
Sansa
would
have
known
who
he
was,
and
the
fat
one
too,
but
Arya
had
never
taken
much
interest
in
titles
and
sigils.
Whenever
Septa
Mordane
had
gone
on
about
the
history
of
this
house
and
that
house,
she
was
inclined
to
drift
and
dream
and
wonder
when
the
lesson
would
be
done.

She
did
remember
Lord
Cerwyn,
though.
His
lands
had
been
close
to
Winterfell,
so
he
and
his
son
Cley
had
often
visited.
Yet
as
fate
would
have
it,
he
was
the
only
captive
who
was
never
seen;
he
was
abed
in
a
tower
cell,
recovering
from
a
wound.
For
days
and
days
Arya
tried
to
work
out
how
she
might
steal
past
the
door
guards
to
see
him.
If
he
knew
her,
he
would
be
honor
bound
to
help
her.
A
lord
would
have
gold
for
a
certainty,
they
all
did;
perhaps
he
would
pay
some
of
Lord
Tywin’s
own
sellswords
to
take
her
to
Riverrun.
Father
had
always
said
that
most
sellswords
would
betray
anyone
for
enough
gold.

Then
one
morning
she
spied
three
women
in
the
cowled
grey
robes
of
the
silent
sisters
loading
a
corpse
into
their
wagon.
The
body
was
sewn
into
a
cloak
of
the
finest
silk,
decorated
with
a
battle-axe
sigil.
When
Arya
asked
who
it
was,
one
of
the
guards
told
her
that
Lord
Cerwyn
had
died.
The
words
felt
like
a
kick
in
the
belly.
He
could
never
have
helped
you
anyway,
she
thought
as
the
sisters
drove
the
wagon
through
the
gate.
He
couldn’t
even
help
himself,
you
stupid
mouse.

After
that
it
was
back
to
scrubbing
and
scurrying
and
listening
at
doors.
Lord
Tywin
would
soon
march
on
Riverrun,
she
heard.
or
he
would
drive
south
to
Highgarden,
no
one
would
ever
expect
that.
No,
he
must
defend
King’s
Landing,
Stannis
was
the
greatest
threat.
He’d
sent
Gregor
Clegane
and
Vargo
Hoat
to
destroy
Roose
Bolton
and
remove
the
dagger
from
his
back.
He’d
sent
ravens
to
the
Eyrie,
he
meant
to
wed
the
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
and
win
the
Vale.
He’d
bought
a
ton
of
silver
to
forge
magic
swords
that
would
slay
the
Stark
wargs.
He
was
writing
Lady
Stark
to
make
a
peace,
the
Kingslayer
would
soon
be
freed.

Though
ravens
came
and
went
every
day,
Lord
Tywin
himself
spent
most
of
his
days
behind
closed
doors
with
his
war
council.
Arya
caught
glimpses
of
him,
but
always
from
afar—once
walking
the
walls
in
the
company
of
three
maesters
and
the
fat
captive
with
the
bushy
mustache,
once
riding
out
with
his
lords
bannermen
to
visit
the
encampments,
but
most
often
standing
in
an
arch
of
the
covered
gallery
watching
men
at
practice
in
the
yard
below.
He
stood
with
his
hands
locked
together
on
the
gold
pommel
of
his
longsword.
They
said
Lord
Tywin
loved
gold
most
of
all;
he
even
shit
gold,
she
heard
one
squire
jest.
The
Lannister
lord
was
strong-looking
for
an
old
man,
with
stiff
golden
whiskers
and
a
bald
head.
There
was
something
in
his
face
that
reminded
Arya
of
her
own
father,
even
though
they
looked
nothing
alike.
He
has
a
lord’s
face,
that’s
all,
she
told
herself.
She
remembered
hearing
her
lady
mother
tell
Father
to
put
on
his
lord’s
face
and
go
deal
with
some
matter.
Father
had
laughed
at
that.
She
could
not
imagine
Lord
Tywin
ever
laughing
at
anything.

One
afternoon,
while
she
was
waiting
her
turn
to
draw
a
pail
of
water
from
the
well,
she
heard
the
hinges
of
the
east
gate
groaning.
A
party
of
men
rode
under
the
portcullis
at
a
walk.
When
she
spied
the
manticore
crawling
across
the
shield
of
their
leader,
a
stab
of
hate
shot
through
her.

In
the
light
of
day,
Ser
Amory
Lorch
looked
less
frightening
than
he
had
by
torchlight,
but
he
still
had
the
pig’s
eyes
she
recalled.
One
of
the
women
said
that
his
men
had
ridden
all
the
way
around
the
lake
chasing
Beric
Dondarrion
and
slaying
rebels.
We
weren’t
rebels,
Arya
thought.
We
were
the
Night’s
Watch;
the
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
side.
Ser
Amory
had
fewer
men
than
she
remembered,
though,
and
many
wounded.
I
hope
their
wounds
fester.
I
hope
they
all
die.

Then
she
saw
the
three
near
the
end
of
the
column.

Rorge
had
donned
a
black
halfhelm
with
a
broad
iron
nasal
that
made
it
hard
to
see
that
he
did
not
have
a
nose.
Biter
rode
ponderously
beside
him
on
a
destrier
that
looked
ready
to
collapse
under
his
weight.
Half-healed
burns
covered
his
body,
making
him
even
more
hideous
than
before.

But
Jaqen
H’ghar
still
smiled.
His
garb
was
still
ragged
and
filthy,
but
he
had
found
time
to
wash
and
brush
his
hair.
It
streamed
down
across
his
shoulders,
red
and
white
and
shiny,
and
Arya
heard
the
girls
giggling
to
each
other
in
admiration.

I
should
have
let
the
fire
have
them.
Gendry
said
to,
I
should
have
listened.
If
she
hadn’t
thrown
them
that
axe
they’d
all
be
dead.
For
a
moment
she
was
afraid,
but
they
rode
past
her
without
a
flicker
of
interest.
Only
Jaqen
H’ghar
so
much
as
glanced
in
her
direction,
and
his
eyes
passed
right
over
her.
He
does
not
know
me,
she
thought.
Arry
was
a
fierce
little
boy
with
a
sword,
and
I’m
just
a
grey
mouse
girl
with
a
pail.

She
spent
the
rest
of
that
day
scrubbing
steps
inside
the
Wailing
Tower.
By
evenfall
her
hands
were
raw
and
bleeding
and
her
arms
so
sore
they
trembled
when
she
lugged
the
pail
back
to
the
cellar.
Too
tired
even
for
food,
Arya
begged
Weese’s
pardons
and
crawled
into
her
straw
to
sleep.
“Weese,”
she
yawned.
“Dunsen,
Chiswyck,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.”
She
thought
she
might
add
three
more
names
to
her
prayer,
but
she
was
too
tired
to
decide
tonight.

Arya
was
dreaming
of
wolves
running
wild
through
the
wood
when
a
strong
hand
clamped
down
over
her
mouth
like
smooth
warm
stone,
solid
and
unyielding.
She
woke
at
once,
squirming
and
struggling.
“A
girl
says
nothing,”
a
voice
whispered
close
behind
her
ear.
“A
girl
keeps
her
lips
closed,
no
one
hears,
and
friends
may
talk
in
secret.
Yes?”

Heart
pounding,
Arya
managed
the
tiniest
of
nods.

Jaqen
H’ghar
took
his
hand
away.
The
cellar
was
black
as
pitch
and
she
could
not
see
his
face,
even
inches
away.
She
could
smell
him,
though;
his
skin
smelled
clean
and
soapy,
and
he
had
scented
his
hair.
“A
boy
becomes
a
girl,”
he
murmured.

“I
was
always
a
girl.
I
didn’t
think
you
saw
me.”

“A
man
sees.
A
man
knows.”

She
remembered
that
she
hated
him.
“You
scared
me.
You’re
one
of
them
now,
I
should
have
let
you
burn.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Go
away
or
I’ll
yell
for
Weese.”

“A
man
pays
his
debts.
A
man
owes
three.”

“Three?”

“The
Red
God
has
his
due,
sweet
girl,
and
only
death
may
pay
for
life.
This
girl
took
three
that
were
his.
This
girl
must
give
three
in
their
places.
Speak
the
names,
and
a
man
will
do
the
rest.”

He
wants
to
help
me,
Arya
realized
with
a
rush
of
hope
that
made
her
dizzy.
“Take
me
to
Riverrun,
it’s
not
far,
if
we
stole
some
horses
we
could—”

He
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips.
“Three
lives
you
shall
have
of
me.
No
more,
no
less.
Three
and
we
are
done.
So
a
girl
must
ponder.”
He
kissed
her
hair
softly.
“But
not
too
long.”

By
the
time
Arya
lit
her
stub
of
a
candle,
only
a
faint
smell
remained
of
him,
a
whiff
of
ginger
and
cloves
lingering
in
the
air.
The
woman
in
the
next
niche
rolled
over
on
her
straw
and
complained
of
the
light,
so
Arya
blew
it
out.
When
she
closed
her
eyes,
she
saw
faces
swimming
before
her.
Joffrey
and
his
mother,
Ilyn
Payne
and
Meryn
Trant
and
Sandor
Clegane…
but
they
were
in
King’s
Landing
hundreds
of
miles
away,
and
Ser
Gregor
had
lingered
only
a
few
nights
before
departing
again
for
more
foraging,
taking
Raff
and
Chiswyck
and
the
Tickler
with
him.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
was
here,
though,
and
she
hated
him
almost
as
much.
Didn’t
she?
She
wasn’t
certain.
And
there
was
always
Weese.

She
thought
of
him
again
the
next
morning,
when
lack
of
sleep
made
her
yawn.
“Weasel,”
Weese
purred,
“next
time
I
see
that
mouth
droop
open,
I’ll
pull
out
your
tongue
and
feed
it
to
my
bitch.”
He
twisted
her
ear
between
his
fingers
to
make
certain
she’d
heard,
and
told
her
to
get
back
to
those
steps,
he
wanted
them
clean
down
to
the
third
landing
by
nightfall.

As
she
worked,
Arya
thought
about
the
people
she
wanted
dead.
She
pretended
she
could
see
their
faces
on
the
steps,
and
scrubbed
harder
to
wipe
them
away.
The
Starks
were
at
war
with
the
Lannisters
and
she
was
a
Stark,
so
she
should
kill
as
many
Lannisters
as
she
could,
that
was
what
you
did
in
wars.
But
she
didn’t
think
she
should
trust
Jaqen.
I
should
kill
them
myself.
Whenever
her
father
had
condemned
a
man
to
death,
he
did
the
deed
himself
with
Ice,
his
greatsword.
“If
you
would
take
a
man’s
life,
you
owe
it
to
him
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
hear
his
last
words,”
she’d
heard
him
tell
Robb
and
Jon
once.

The
next
day
she
avoided
Jaqen
H’ghar,
and
the
day
after
that.
It
was
not
hard.
She
was
very
small
and
Harrenhal
was
very
large,
full
of
places
where
a
mouse
could
hide.

And
then
Ser
Gregor
returned,
earlier
than
expected,
driving
a
herd
of
goats
this
time
in
place
of
a
herd
of
prisoners.
She
heard
he’d
lost
four
men
in
one
of
Lord
Beric’s
night
raids,
but
those
Arya
hated
returned
unscathed
and
took
up
residence
on
the
second
floor
of
the
Wailing
Tower.
Weese
saw
that
they
were
well
supplied
with
drink.
“They
always
have
a
good
thirst,
that
lot,”
he
grumbled.
“Weasel,
go
up
and
ask
if
they’ve
got
any
clothes
that
need
mending,
I’ll
have
the
women
see
to
it.”

Arya
ran
up
her
well-scrubbed
steps.
No
one
paid
her
any
mind
when
she
entered.
Chiswyck
was
seated
by
the
fire
with
a
horn
of
ale
to
hand,
telling
one
of
his
funny
stories.
She
dared
not
interrupt,
unless
she
wanted
a
bloody
lip.

“After
the
Hand’s
tourney,
it
were,
before
the
war
come,”
Chiswyck
was
saying.
“We
were
on
our
ways
back
west,
seven
of
us
with
Ser
Gregor.
Raff
was
with
me,
and
young
Joss
Stilwood,
he’d
squired
for
Ser
in
the
lists.
Well,
we
come
on
this
pisswater
river,
running
high
on
account
there’d
been
rains.
No
way
to
ford,
but
there’s
an
alehouse
near,
so
there
we
repair.
Ser
rousts
the
brewer
and
tells
him
to
keep
our
horns
full
till
the
waters
fall,
and
you
should
see
the
man’s
pig
eyes
shine
at
the
sight
o’
silver.
So
he’s
fetching
us
ale,
him
and
his
daughter,
and
poor
thin
stuff
it
is,
no
more’n
brown
piss,
which
don’t
make
me
any
happier,
nor
Ser
neither.
And
all
the
time
this
brewer’s
saying
how
glad
he
is
to
have
us,
custom
being
slow
on
account
o’
them
rains.
The
fool
won’t
shut
his
yap,
not
him,
though
Ser
is
saying
not
a
word,
just
brooding
on
the
Knight
o’
Pansies
and
that
bugger’s
trick
he
played.
You
can
see
how
tight
his
mouth
sits,
so
me
and
the
other
lads
we
know
better’n
to
say
a
squeak
to
him,
but
this
brewer
he’s
got
to
talk,
he
even
asks
how
m’lord
fared
in
the
jousting.
Ser
just
gave
him
this
look.”
Chiswyck
cackled,
quaffed
his
ale,
and
wiped
the
foam
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Meanwhile,
this
daughter
of
his
has
been
fetching
and
pouring,
a
fat
little
thing,
eighteen
or
so—”

“Thirteen,
more
like,”
Raff
the
Sweetling
drawled.

“Well,
be
that
as
it
may,
she’s
not
much
to
look
at,
but
Eggon’s
been
drinking
and
gets
to
touching
her,
and
might
be
I
did
a
little
touching
meself,
and
Raff’s
telling
young
Stilwood
that
he
ought
t’
drag
the
girl
upstairs
and
make
hisself
a
man,
giving
the
lad
courage
as
it
were.
Finally
Joss
reaches
up
under
her
skirt,
and
she
shrieks
and
drops
her
flagon
and
goes
running
off
to
the
kitchen.
Well,
it
would
have
ended
right
there,
only
what
does
the
old
fool
do
but
he
goes
to
Ser
and
asks
him
to
make
us
leave
the
girl
alone,
him
being
an
anointed
knight
and
all
such.

“Ser
Gregor,
he
wasn’t
paying
no
mind
to
none
of
our
fun,
but
now
he
looks,
you
know
how
he
does,
and
he
commands
that
the
girl
be
brought
before
him.
Now
the
old
man
has
to
drag
her
out
of
the
kitchen,
and
no
one
to
blame
but
hisself.
Ser
looks
her
over
and
says,
‘So
this
is
the
whore
you’re
so
concerned
for’
and
this
besotted
old
fool
says,
‘My
Layna’s
no
whore,
ser’
right
to
Gregor’s
face.
Ser,
he
never
blinks,
just
says,
‘She
is
now’
tosses
the
old
man
another
silver,
rips
the
dress
off
the
wench,
and
takes
her
right
there
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
da,
her
flopping
and
wiggling
like
a
rabbit
and
making
these
noises.
The
look
on
the
old
man’s
face,
I
laughed
so
hard
ale
was
coming
out
me
nose.
Then
this
boy
hears
the
noise,
the
son
I
figure,
and
comes
rushing
up
from
the
cellar,
so
Raff
has
to
stick
a
dirk
in
his
belly.
By
then
Ser’s
done,
so
he
goes
back
to
his
drinking
and
we
all
have
a
turn.
Tobbot,
you
know
how
he
is,
he
flops
her
over
and
goes
in
the
back
way.
The
girl
was
done
fighting
by
the
time
I
had
her,
maybe
she’d
decided
she
liked
it
after
all,
though
to
tell
the
truth
I
wouldn’t
have
minded
a
little
wiggling.
And
now
here’s
the
best
bit…
when
it’s
all
done,
Ser
tells
the
old
man
that
he
wants
his
change.
The
girl
wasn’t
worth
a
silver,
he
says…
and
damned
if
that
old
man
didn’t
fetch
a
fistful
of
coppers,
beg
m’lord’s
pardon,
and
thank
him
for
the
custom!”

The
men
all
roared,
none
louder
than
Chiswyck
himself,
who
laughed
so
hard
at
his
own
story
that
snot
dribbled
from
his
nose
down
into
his
scraggy
grey
beard.
Arya
stood
in
the
shadows
of
the
stairwell
and
watched
him.
She
crept
back
down
to
the
cellars
without
saying
a
word.
When
Weese
found
that
she
hadn’t
asked
about
the
clothes,
he
yanked
down
her
breeches
and
caned
her
until
blood
ran
down
her
thighs,
but
Arya
closed
her
eyes
and
thought
of
all
the
sayings
Syrio
had
taught
her,
so
she
scarcely
felt
it.

Two
nights
later,
he
sent
her
to
the
Barracks
Hall
to
serve
at
table.
She
was
carrying
a
flagon
of
wine
and
pouring
when
she
glimpsed
Jaqen
H’ghar
at
his
trencher
across
the
aisle.
Chewing
her
lip,
Arya
glanced
around
warily
to
make
certain
Weese
was
not
in
sight.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
told
herself.

She
took
a
step,
and
another,
and
with
each
she
felt
less
a
mouse.
She
worked
her
way
down
the
bench,
filling
wine
cups.
Rorge
sat
to
Jaqen’s
right,
deep
drunk,
but
he
took
no
note
of
her.
Arya
leaned
close
and
whispered,
“Chiswyck,”
right
in
Jaqen’s
ear.
The
Lorathi
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
heard.

When
her
flagon
was
empty,
Arya
hurried
down
to
the
cellars
to
refill
it
from
the
cask,
and
quickly
returned
to
her
pouring.
No
one
had
died
of
thirst
while
she
was
gone,
nor
even
noted
her
brief
absence.

Nothing
happened
the
next
day,
nor
the
day
after,
but
on
the
third
day
Arya
went
to
the
kitchens
with
Weese
to
fetch
their
dinner.
“One
of
the
Mountain’s
men
fell
off
a
wallwalk
last
night
and
broke
his
fool
neck,”
she
heard
Weese
tell
a
cook.

“Drunk?”
the
woman
asked.

“No
more’n
usual.
Some
are
saying
it
was
Harren’s
ghost
flung
him
down.”
He
snorted
to
show
what
he
thought
of
such
notions.

It
wasn’t
Harren,
Arya
wanted
to
say,
it
was
me.
She
had
killed
Chiswyck
with
a
whisper,
and
she
would
kill
two
more
before
she
was
through.
I’m
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal,
she
thought.
And
that
night,
there
was
one
less
name
to
hate.





CATELYN

The
meeting
place
was
a
grassy
sward
dotted
with
pale
grey
mushrooms
and
the
raw
stumps
of
felled
trees.

“We
are
the
first,
my
lady,”
Hallis
Mollen
said
as
they
reined
up
amidst
the
stumps,
alone
between
the
armies.
The
direwolf
banner
of
House
Stark
flapped
and
fluttered
atop
the
lance
he
bore.
Catelyn
could
not
see
the
sea
from
here,
but
she
could
feel
how
close
it
was.
The
smell
of
salt
was
heavy
on
the
wind
gusting
from
the
east.

Stannis
Baratheon’s
foragers
had
cut
the
trees
down
for
his
siege
towers
and
catapults.
Catelyn
wondered
how
long
the
grove
had
stood,
and
whether
Ned
had
rested
here
when
he
led
his
host
south
to
lift
the
last
siege
of
Storm’s
End.
He
had
won
a
great
victory
that
day,
all
the
greater
for
being
bloodless.

Gods
grant
that
I
shall
do
the
same,
Catelyn
prayed.
Her
own
liege
men
thought
she
was
mad
even
to
come.
“This
is
no
fight
of
ours,
my
lady,”
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
had
said.
“I
know
the
king
would
not
wish
his
mother
to
put
herself
at
risk.”

“We
are
all
at
risk,”
she
told
him,
perhaps
too
sharply.
“Do
you
think
I
wish
to
be
here,
ser?”
I
belong
at
Riverrun
with
my
dying
father,
at
Winterfell
with
my
sons.
“Robb
sent
me
south
to
speak
for
him,
and
speak
for
him
I
shall.”
It
would
be
no
easy
thing
to
forge
a
peace
between
these
brothers,
Catelyn
knew,
yet
for
the
good
of
the
realm,
it
must
be
tried.

Across
rain-sodden
flelds
and
stony
ridges,
she
could
see
the
great
castle
of
Storm’s
End
rearing
up
against
the
sky,
its
back
to
the
unseen
sea.
Beneath
that
mass
of
pale
grey
stone,
the
encircling
army
of
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon
looked
as
small
and
insignificant
as
mice
with
banners.

The
songs
said
that
Storm’s
End
had
been
raised
in
ancient
days
by
Durran,
the
first
Storm
King,
who
had
won
the
love
of
the
fair
Elenei,
daughter
of
the
sea
god
and
the
goddess
of
the
wind.
On
the
night
of
their
wedding,
Elenei
had
yielded
her
maidenhood
to
a
mortal’s
love
and
thus
doomed
herself
to
a
mortal’s
death,
and
her
grieving
parents
had
unleashed
their
wrath
and
sent
the
winds
and
waters
to
batter
down
Durran’s
hold.
His
friends
and
brothers
and
wedding
guests
were
crushed
beneath
collapsing
walls
or
blown
out
to
sea,
but
Elenei
sheltered
Durran
within
her
arms
so
he
took
no
harm,
and
when
the
dawn
came
at
last
he
declared
war
upon
the
gods
and
vowed
to
rebuild.

Five
more
castles
he
built,
each
larger
and
stronger
than
the
last,
only
to
see
them
smashed
asunder
when
the
gale
winds
came
howling
up
Shipbreaker
Bay,
driving
great
walls
of
water
before
them.
His
lords
pleaded
with
him
to
build
inland;
his
priests
told
him
he
must
placate
the
gods
by
giving
Elenei
back
to
the
sea;
even
his
smallfolk
begged
him
to
relent.
Durran
would
have
none
of
it.
A
seventh
castle
he
raised,
most
massive
of
all.
Some
said
the
children
of
the
forest
helped
him
build
it,
shaping
the
stones
with
magic;
others
claimed
that
a
small
boy
told
him
what
he
must
do,
a
boy
who
would
grow
to
be
Bran
the
Builder.
No
matter
how
the
tale
was
told,
the
end
was
the
same.
Though
the
angry
gods
threw
storm
after
storm
against
it,
the
seventh
castle
stood
defiant,
and
Durran
Godsgrief
and
fair
Elenei
dwelt
there
together
until
the
end
of
their
days.

Gods
do
not
forget,
and
still
the
gales
came
raging
up
the
narrow
sea.
Yet
Storm’s
End
endured,
through
centuries
and
tens
of
centuries,
a
castle
like
no
other.
Its
great
curtain
wall
was
a
hundred
feet
high,
unbroken
by
arrow
slit
or
postern,
everywhere
rounded,
curving,
smooth,
its
stones
fit
so
cunningly
together
that
nowhere
was
crevice
nor
angle
nor
gap
by
which
the
wind
might
enter.
That
wall
was
said
to
be
forty
feet
thick
at
its
narrowest,
and
near
eighty
on
the
seaward
face,
a
double
course
of
stones
with
an
inner
core
of
sand
and
rubble.
Within
that
mighty
bulwark,
the
kitchens
and
stables
and
yards
sheltered
safe
from
wind
and
wave.
Of
towers,
there
was
but
one,
a
colossal
drum
tower,
windowless
where
it
faced
the
sea,
so
large
that
it
was
granary
and
barracks
and
feast
hall
and
lord’s
dwelling
all
in
one,
crowned
by
massive
battlements
that
made
it
look
from
afar
like
a
spiked
flst
atop
an
upthrust
arm.

“My
lady,”
Hal
Mollen
called.
Two
riders
had
emerged
from
the
tidy
little
camp
beneath
the
castle,
and
were
coming
toward
them
at
a
slow
walk.
“That
will
be
King
Stannis.”

“No
doubt.”
Catelyn
watched
them
come.
Stannis
it
must
be,
yet
that
is
not
the
Baratheon
banner.
It
was
a
bright
yellow,
not
the
rich
gold
of
Renly’s
standards,
and
the
device
it
bore
was
red,
though
she
could
not
make
out
its
shape.

Renly
would
be
last
to
arrive.
He
had
told
her
as
much
when
she
set
out.
He
did
not
propose
to
mount
his
horse
until
he
saw
his
brother
well
on
his
way.
The
first
to
arrive
must
wait
on
the
other,
and
Renly
would
do
no
waiting.
It
is
a
sort
of
game
kings
play,
she
told
herself.
Well,
she
was
no
king,
so
she
need
not
play
it.
Catelyn
was
practiced
at
waiting.

As
he
neared,
she
saw
that
Stannis
wore
a
crown
of
red
gold
with
points
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
flames.
His
belt
was
studded
with
garnets
and
yellow
topaz,
and
a
great
square-cut
ruby
was
set
in
the
hilt
of
the
sword
he
wore.
Otherwise
his
dress
was
plain:
studded
leather
jerkin
over
quilted
doublet,
worn
boots,
breeches
of
brown
roughspun.
The
device
on
his
sun-yellow
banner
showed
a
red
heart
surrounded
by
a
blaze
of
orange
fire.
The
crowned
stag
was
there,
yes…
shrunken
and
enclosed
within
the
heart.
Even
more
curious
was
his
standard
bearer—a
woman,
garbed
all
in
reds,
face
shadowed
within
the
deep
hood
of
her
scarlet
cloak.
A
red
priestess,
Catelyn
thought,
wondering.
The
sect
was
numerous
and
powerful
in
the
Free
Cities
and
the
distant
east,
but
there
were
few
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

“Lady
Stark,”
Stannis
Baratheon
said
with
chill
courtesy
as
he
reined
up.
He
inclined
his
head,
balder
than
she
remembered.

“Lord
Stannis,”
she
returned.

Beneath
the
tight-trimmed
beard
his
heavy
jaw
clenched
hard,
yet
he
did
not
hector
her
about
titles.
For
that
she
was
duly
grateful.
“I
had
not
thought
to
find
you
at
Storm’s
End.”

“I
had
not
thought
to
be
here.”

His
deepset
eyes
regarded
her
uncomfortably.
This
was
not
a
man
made
for
easy
courtesies.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
lord’s
death,”
he
said,
“though
Eddard
Stark
was
no
friend
to
me.”

“He
was
never
your
enemy,
my
lord.
When
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
held
you
prisoned
in
that
castle,
starving,
it
was
Eddard
Stark
who
broke
the
siege.”

“At
my
brother’s
command,
not
for
love
of
me,”
Stannis
answered.
“Lord
Eddard
did
his
duty,
I
will
not
deny
it.
Did
I
ever
do
less?
I
should
have
been
Robert’s
Hand.”

“That
was
your
brother’s
will.
Ned
never
wanted
it.”

“Yet
he
took
it.
That
which
should
have
been
mine.
Still,
I
give
you
my
word,
you
shall
have
justice
for
his
murder.”

How
they
loved
to
promise
heads,
these
men
who
would
be
king.
“Your
brother
promised
me
the
same.
But
if
truth
be
told,
I
would
sooner
have
my
daughters
back,
and
leave
justice
to
the
gods.
Cersei
still
holds
my
Sansa,
and
of
Arya
there
has
been
no
word
since
the
day
of
Robert’s
death.”

“If
your
children
are
found
when
I
take
the
city,
they
shall
be
sent
to
you.”
Alive
or
dead,
his
tone
implied.

“And
when
shall
that
be,
Lord
Stannis?
King’s
Landing
is
close
to
your
Dragonstone,
but
I
find
you
here
instead.”

“You
are
frank,
Lady
Stark.
Very
well,
I’ll
answer
you
frankly.
To
take
the
city,
I
need
the
power
of
these
southron
lords
I
see
across
the
field.
My
brother
has
them.
I
must
needs
take
them
from
him.”

“Men
give
their
allegiance
where
they
will,
my
lord.
These
lords
swore
fealty
to
Robert
and
House
Baratheon.
If
you
and
your
brother
were
to
put
aside
your
quarrel—”

“I
have
no
quarrel
with
Renly,
should
he
prove
dutiful.
I
am
his
elder,
and
his
king.
I
want
only
what
is
mine
by
rights.
Renly
owes
me
loyalty
and
obedience.
I
mean
to
have
it.
From
him,
and
from
these
other
lords.”
Stannis
studied
her
face.
“And
what
cause
brings
you
to
this
field,
my
lady?
Has
House
Stark
cast
its
lot
with
my
brother,
is
that
the
way
of
it?”

This
one
will
never
bend,
she
thought,
yet
she
must
try
nonetheless.
Too
much
was
at
stake.
“My
son
reigns
as
King
in
the
North,
by
the
will
of
our
lords
and
people.
He
bends
the
knee
to
no
man,
but
holds
out
the
hand
of
friendship
to
all.”

“Kings
have
no
friends,”
Stannis
said
bluntly,
“only
subjects
and
enemies.”

“And
brothers,”
a
cheerful
voice
called
out
behind
her.
Catelyn
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
Lord
Renly’s
palfrey
picked
her
way
through
the
stumps.
The
younger
Baratheon
was
splendid
in
his
green
velvet
doublet
and
satin
cloak
trimmed
in
vair.
The
crown
of
golden
roses
girded
his
temples,
jade
stag’s
head
rising
over
his
forehead,
long
black
hair
spilling
out
beneath.
jagged
chunks
of
black
diamond
studded
his
swordbelt,
and
a
chain
of
gold
and
emeralds
looped
around
his
neck.

Renly
had
chosen
a
woman
to
carry
his
banner
as
well,
though
Brienne
hid
face
and
form
behind
plate
armor
that
gave
no
hint
of
her
sex.
Atop
her
twelve-foot
lance,
the
crowned
stag
pranced
black-on-gold
as
the
wind
off
the
sea
rippled
the
cloth.

His
brother’s
greeting
was
curt.
“Lord
Renly.”

“King
Renly.
Can
that
truly
be
you,
Stannis?”

Stannis
frowned.
“Who
else
should
it
be?”

Renly
gave
an
easy
shrug.
“When
I
saw
that
standard,
I
could
not
be
certain.
Whose
banner
do
you
bear?”

“Mine
own.”

The
red-clad
priestess
spoke
up.
“The
king
has
taken
for
his
sigil
the
fiery
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light.”

Renly
seemed
amused
by
that.
“All
for
the
good.
If
we
both
use
the
same
banner,
the
battle
will
be
terribly
confused.”

Catelyn
said,
“Let
us
hope
there
will
be
no
battle.
We
three
share
a
common
foe
who
would
destroy
us
all.”

Stannis
studied
her,
unsmiling.
“The
Iron
Throne
is
mine
by
rights.
All
those
who
deny
that
are
my
foes.”

“The
whole
of
the
realm
denies
it,
brother,”
said
Renly.
“Old
men
deny
it
with
their
death
rattle,
and
unborn
children
deny
it
in
their
mothers’wombs.
They
deny
it
in
Dorne
and
they
deny
it
on
the
Wall.
No
one
wants
you
for
their
king.
Sorry.”

Stannis
clenched
his
jaw,
his
face
taut.
“I
swore
I
would
never
treat
with
you
while
you
wore
your
traitor’s
crown.
Would
that
I
had
kept
to
that
vow.”

“This
is
folly,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“Lord
Tywin
sits
at
Harrenhal
with
twenty
thousand
swords.
The
remnants
of
the
Kingslayer’s
army
have
regrouped
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
another
Lannister
host
gathers
beneath
the
shadow
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
Cersei
and
her
son
hold
King’s
Landing
and
your
precious
Iron
Throne.
You
each
name
yourself
king,
yet
the
kingdom
bleeds,
and
no
one
lifts
a
sword
to
defend
it
but
my
son.”

Renly
shrugged.
“Your
son
has
won
a
few
battles.
I
shall
win
the
war.
The
Lannisters
can
wait
my
pleasure.”

“If
you
have
proposals
to
make,
make
them,”
Stannis
said
brusquely,
“or
I
will
be
gone.”

“Very
well,”
said
Renly.
“I
propose
that
you
dismount,
bend
your
knee,
and
swear
me
your
allegiance.”

Stannis
choked
back
rage.
“That
you
shall
never
have.”

“You
served
Robert,
why
not
me?”

“Robert
was
my
elder
brother.
You
are
the
younger.”

“Younger,
bolder,
and
far
more
comely…”

“…and
a
thief
and
a
usurper
besides.”

Renly
shrugged.
“The
Targaryens
called
Robert
usurper.
He
seemed
to
be
able
to
bear
the
shame.
So
shall
I.”

This
will
not
do.
“Listen
to
yourselves!
If
you
were
sons
of
mine,
I
would
bang
your
heads
together
and
lock
you
in
a
bedchamber
until
you
remembered
that
you
were
brothers.”

Stannis
frowned
at
her.
“You
presume
too
much,
Lady
Stark.
I
am
the
rightful
king,
and
your
son
no
less
a
traitor
than
my
brother
here.
His
day
will
come
as
well.”

The
naked
threat
fanned
her
fury.
“You
are
very
free
to
name
others
traitor
and
usurper,
my
lord,
yet
how
are
you
any
different?
You
say
you
alone
are
the
rightful
king,
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
Robert
had
two
sons.
By
all
the
laws
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
Prince
Joffrey
is
his
rightful
heir,
and
Tornmen
after
him…
and
we
are
all
traitors,
however
good
our
reasons.”

Renly
laughed.
“You
must
forgive
Lady
Catelyn,
Stannis.
She’s
come
all
the
way
down
from
Riverrun,
a
long
way
ahorse.
I
fear
she
never
saw
your
little
letter.”

“Joffrey
is
not
my
brother’s
seed,”
Stannis
said
bluntly.
“Nor
is
Tommen.
They
are
bastards.
The
girl
as
well.
All
three
of
them
abominations
born
of
incest.”

Would
even
Cersei
be
so
mad?
Catelyn
was
speechless.

“Isn’t
that
a
sweet
story,
my
lady?”
Renly
asked.
“I
was
camped
at
Horn
Hill
when
Lord
Tarly
received
his
letter,
and
I
must
say,
it
took
my
breath
away.”
He
smiled
at
his
brother.
“I
had
never
suspected
you
were
so
clever,
Stannis.
Were
it
only
true,
you
would
indeed
be
Robert’s
heir.”

“Were
it
true?
Do
you
name
me
a
liar?”

“Can
you
prove
any
word
of
this
fable?”

Stannis
ground
his
teeth.

Robert
could
never
have
known,
Catelyn
thought,
or
Cersei
would
have
lost
her
head
in
an
instant.
“Lord
Stannis,”
she
asked,
“if
you
knew
the
queen
to
be
guilty
of
such
monstrous
crimes,
why
did
you
keep
silent?
“

“I
did
not
keep
silent,”
Stannis
declared.
“I
brought
my
suspicions
to
Jon
Arryn.”

“Rather
than
your
own
brother?”

“My
brother’s
regard
for
me
was
never
more
than
dutiful,”
said
Stannis.
“From
me,
such
accusations
would
have
seemed
peevish
and
self-serving,
a
means
of
placing
myself
first
in
the
line
of
succession.
I
believed
Robert
would
be
more
disposed
to
listen
if
the
charges
came
from
Lord
Arryn,
whom
he
loved.”

“Ah,”
said
Renly.
“So
we
have
the
word
of
a
dead
man.”

“Do
you
think
he
died
by
happenstance,
you
purblind
fool?
Cersei
had
him
poisoned,
for
fear
he
would
reveal
her.
Lord
Jon
had
been
gathering
certain
proofs—”

“—which
doubtless
died
with
him.
How
inconvenient.”

Catelyn
was
remembering,
fitting
pieces
together.
“My
sister
Lysa
accused
the
queen
of
killing
her
husband
in
a
letter
she
sent
me
at
Winterfell,”
she
admitted.
“Later,
in
the
Eyrie,
she
laid
the
murder
at
the
feet
of
the
queen’s
brother
Tyrion.”

Stannis
snorted.
“If
you
step
in
a
nest
of
snakes,
does
it
matter
which
one
bites
you
first?”

“All
this
of
snakes
and
incest
is
droll,
but
it
changes
nothing.
You
may
well
have
the
better
claim,
Stannis,
but
I
still
have
the
larger
army.”
Renly’s
hand
slid
inside
his
cloak.
Stannis
saw,
and
reached
at
once
for
the
hilt
of
his
sword,
but
before
he
could
draw
steel
his
brother
produced…
a
peach.
“Would
you
like
one,
brother?”
Renly
asked,
smiling.
“From
Highgarden.
You’ve
never
tasted
anything
so
sweet,
I
promise
you.”
He
took
a
bite.
juice
ran
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth.

“I
did
not
come
here
to
eat
fruit.”
Stannis
was
fuming.

“My
lords!”
Catelyn
said.
“We
ought
to
be
hammering
out
the
terms
of
an
alliance,
not
trading
taunts.”

“A
man
should
never
refuse
to
taste
a
peach,”
Renly
said
as
he
tossed
the
stone
away.
“He
may
never
get
the
chance
again.
Life
is
short,
Stannis.
Remember
what
the
Starks
say.
Winter
is
coming.”
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.

“I
did
not
come
here
to
be
threatened,
either.”

“Nor
were
you,”
Renly
snapped
back.
“When
I
make
threats,
you’ll
know
it.
If
truth
be
told,
I’ve
never
liked
you,
Stannis,
but
you
are
my
own
blood,
and
I
have
no
wish
to
slay
you.
So
if
it
is
Storm’s
End
you
want,
take
it…
as
a
brother’s
gift.
As
Robert
once
gave
it
to
me,
I
give
it
to
you.”

“It
is
not
yours
to
give.
It
is
mine
by
rights.”

Sighing,
Renly
half
turned
in
the
saddle.
“What
am
I
to
do
with
this
brother
of
mine,
Brienne?
He
refuses
my
peach,
he
refuses
my
castle,
he
even
shunned
my
wedding…”

“We
both
know
your
wedding
was
a
mummer’s
farce.
A
year
ago
you
were
scheming
to
make
the
girl
one
of
Robert’s
whores.”

“A
year
ago
I
was
scheming
to
make
the
girl
Robert’s
queen,”
Renly
said,
“but
what
does
it
matter?
The
boar
got
Robert
and
I
got
Margaery.
You’ll
be
pleased
to
know
she
came
to
me
a
maid.”

“In
your
bed
she’s
like
to
die
that
way.”

“Oh,
I
expect
I’ll
get
a
son
on
her
within
the
year.
Pray,
how
many
sons
do
you
have,
Stannis?
Oh,
yes—none.”
Renly
smiled
innocently.
“As
to
your
daughter,
I
understand.
If
my
wife
looked
like
yours,
I’d
send
my
fool
to
service
her
as
well.”

“Enough!”
Stannis
roared.
“I
will
not
be
mocked
to
my
face,
do
you
hear
me?
I
will
not!”
He
yanked
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.
The
steel
gleamed
strangely
bright
in
the
wan
sunlight,
now
red,
now
yellow,
now
blazing
white.
The
air
around
it
seemed
to
shimmer,
as
if
from
heat.

Catelyn’s
horse
whinnied
and
backed
away
a
step,
but
Brienne
moved
between
the
brothers,
her
own
blade
in
hand.
“Put
up
your
steel!”
she
shouted
at
Stannis.

Cersei
Lannister
is
laughing
herself
breathless,
Catelyn
thought
wearily.

Stannis
pointed
his
shining
sword
at
his
brother.
“I
am
not
without
mercy,”
thundered
he
who
was
notoriously
without
mercy.
“Nor
do
I
wish
to
sully
Lightbringer
with
a
brother’s
blood.
For
the
sake
of
the
mother
who
bore
us
both,
I
will
give
you
this
night
to
rethink
your
folly,
Renly.
Strike
your
banners
and
come
to
me
before
dawn,
and
I
will
grant
you
Storm’s
End
and
your
old
seat
on
the
council
and
even
name
you
my
heir
until
a
son
is
born
to
me.
Otherwise,
I
shall
destroy
you.”

Renly
laughed.
“Stannis,
that’s
a
very
pretty
sword,
I’ll
grant
you,
but
I
think
the
glow
off
it
has
ruined
your
eyes.
Look
across
the
fields,
brother.
Can
you
see
all
those
banners?”

“Do
you
think
a
few
bolts
of
cloth
will
make
you
king?”

“Tyrell
swords
will
make
me
king.
Rowan
and
Tarly
and
Caron
will
make
me
king,
with
axe
and
mace
and
warhammer.
Tarth
arrows
and
Penrose
lances,
Fossoway,
Cuy,
Mullendore,
Estermont,
Selmy,
Hightower,
Oakheart,
Crane,
Caswell,
Blackbar,
Morrigen,
Beesbury,
Shermer,
Dunn,
Footly…
even
House
Florent,
your
own
wife’s
brothers
and
uncles,
they
will
make
me
king.
All
the
chivalry
of
the
south
rides
with
me,
and
that
is
the
least
part
of
my
power.
My
foot
is
coming
behind,
a
hundred
thousand
swords
and
spears
and
pikes.
And
you
will
destroy
me?
With
what,
pray?
That
paltry
rabble
I
see
there
huddled
under
the
castle
walls?
I’ll
call
them
five
thousand
and
be
generous,
codfish
lords
and
onion
knights
and
sellswords.
Half
of
them
are
like
to
come
over
to
me
before
the
battle
starts.
You
have
fewer
than
four
hundred
horse,
my
scouts
tell
me—freeriders
in
boiled
leather
who
will
not
stand
an
instant
against
armored
lances.
I
do
not
care
how
seasoned
a
warrior
you
think
you
are,
Stannis,
that
host
of
yours
won’t
survive
the
first
charge
of
my
vanguard.”

“We
shall
see,
brother.”
Some
of
the
light
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
world
when
Stannis
slid
his
sword
back
into
its
scabbard.
“Come
the
dawn,
we
shall
see.”

“I
hope
your
new
god’s
a
merciful
one,
brother.”

Stannis
snorted
and
galloped
away,
disdainful.
The
red
priestess
lingered
a
moment
behind.
“Look
to
your
own
sins,
Lord
Renly,”
she
said
as
she
wheeled
her
horse
around.

Catelyn
and
Lord
Renly
returned
together
to
the
camp
where
his
thousands
and
her
few
waited
their
return.
“That
was
amusing,
if
not
terribly
profitable,”
he
commented.
“I
wonder
where
I
can
get
a
sword
like
that?
Well,
doubtless
Loras
will
make
me
a
gift
of
it
after
the
battle.
it
grieves
me
that
it
must
come
to
this.”

“You
have
a
cheerful
way
of
grieving,”
said
Catelyn,
whose
distress
was
not
feigned.

“Do
I?”
Renly
shrugged.
“So
be
it.
Stannis
was
never
the
most
cherished
of
brothers,
I
confess.
Do
you
suppose
this
tale
of
his
is
true?
If
Joffrey
is
the
Kingslayer’s
get—”

“—your
brother
is
the
lawful
heir.”

“While
he
lives,”
Renly
admitted.
“Though
it’s
a
fool’s
law,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
Why
the
oldest
son,
and
not
the
best-fitted?
The
crown
will
suit
me,
as
it
never
suited
Robert
and
would
not
suit
Stannis.
I
have
it
in
me
to
be
a
great
king,
strong
yet
generous,
clever,
just,
diligent,
loyal
to
my
friends
and
terrible
to
my
enemies,
yet
capable
of
forgiveness,
patient—”

“—humble?”
Catelyn
supplied.

Renly
laughed.
“You
must
allow
a
king
some
flaws,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
felt
very
tired.
It
had
all
been
for
nothing.
The
Baratheon
brothers
would
drown
each
other
in
blood
while
her
son
faced
the
Lannisters
alone,
and
nothing
she
could
say
or
do
would
stop
it.
It
is
past
time
I
went
back
to
Riverrun
to
close
my
father’s
eyes,
she
thought.
That
much
at
least
I
can
do.
I
may
be
a
poor
envoy,
but
I
am
a
good
mourner,
gods
save
me.

Their
camp
was
well
sited
atop
a
low
stony
ridge
that
ran
from
north
to
south.
It
was
far
more
orderly
than
the
sprawling
encampment
on
the
Mander,
though
only
a
quarter
as
large.
When
he’d
learned
of
his
brother’s
assault
on
Storm’s
End,
Renly
had
split
his
forces,
much
as
Robb
had
done
at
the
Twins.
His
great
mass
of
foot
he
had
left
behind
at
Bitterbridge
with
his
young
queen,
his
wagons,
carts,
draft
animals,
and
all
his
cumbersome
siege
machinery,
while
Renly
himself
led
his
knights
and
freeriders
in
a
swift
dash
east.

How
like
his
brother
Robert
he
was,
even
in
that…
only
Robert
had
always
had
Eddard
Stark
to
temper
his
boldness
with
caution.
Ned
would
surely
have
prevailed
upon
Robert
to
bring
up
his
whole
force,
to
encircle
Stannis
and
besiege
the
besiegers.
That
choice
Renly
had
denied
himself
in
his
headlong
rush
to
come
to
grips
with
his
brother.
He
had
outdistanced
his
supply
lines,
left
food
and
forage
days
behind
with
all
his
wagons
and
mules
and
oxen.
He
must
come
to
battle
soon,
or
starve.

Catelyn
sent
Hal
Mollen
to
tend
to
their
horses
while
she
accompanied
Renly
back
to
the
royal
pavilion
at
the
heart
of
the
encampment.
Inside
the
walls
of
green
silk,
his
captains
and
lords
bannermen
were
waiting
to
hear
word
of
the
parley.
“My
brother
has
not
changed,”
their
young
king
told
them
as
Brienne
unfastened
his
cloak
and
lifted
the
gold-and-jade
crown
from
his
brow.
“Castles
and
courtesies
will
not
appease
him,
he
must
have
blood.
Well,
I
am
of
a
mind
to
grant
his
wish.”

“Your
Grace,
I
see
no
need
for
battle
here,”
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
put
in.
“The
castle
is
strongly
garrisoned
and
well
provisioned,
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
a
seasoned
commander,
and
the
trebuchet
has
not
been
built
that
could
breach
the
walls
of
Storm’s
End.
Let
Lord
Stannis
have
his
siege.
He
will
find
no
joy
in
it,
and
whilst
he
sits
cold
and
hungry
and
profitless,
we
will
take
King’s
Landing.”

“And
have
men
say
I
feared
to
face
Stannis?”

“Only
fools
will
say
that,”
Lord
Mathis
argued.

Renly
looked
to
the
others.
“What
say
you
all?”

“I
say
that
Stannis
is
a
danger
to
you,”
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
declared.
“Leave
him
unblooded
and
he
will
only
grow
stronger,
while
your
own
power
is
diminished
by
battle.
The
Lannisters
will
not
be
beaten
in
a
day.
By
the
time
you
are
done
with
them,
Lord
Stannis
may
be
as
strong
as
you…
or
stronger.”

Others
chorused
their
agreement.
The
king
looked
pleased.
“We
shall
fight,
then.”

I
have
failed
Robb
as
I
failed
Ned,
Catelyn
thought.
“My
lord,”
she
announced.
“If
you
are
set
on
battle,
my
purpose
here
is
done.
I
ask
your
leave
to
return
to
Riverrun.”

“You
do
not
have
it.”
Renly
seated
himself
on
a
camp
chair.

She
stiffened.
“I
had
hoped
to
help
you
make
a
peace,
my
lord.
I
will
not
help
you
make
a
war.”

Renly
gave
a
shrug.
“I
daresay
we’ll
prevail
without
your
five-and-twenty,
my
lady.
I
do
not
mean
for
you
to
take
part
in
the
battle,
only
to
watch
it.”

“I
was
at
the
Whispering
Wood,
my
lord.
I
have
seen
enough
butchery.
I
came
here
an
envoy—”

“And
an
envoy
you
shall
leave,”
Renly
said,
“but
wiser
than
you
came.
You
shall
see
what
befalls
rebels
with
your
own
eyes,
so
your
son
can
hear
it
from
your
own
lips.
We’ll
keep
you
safe,
never
fear.”
He
turned
away
to
make
his
dispositions.
“Lord
Mathis,
you
shall
lead
the
center
of
my
main
battle.
Bryce,
you’ll
have
the
left.
The
right
is
mine.
Lord
Estermont,
you
shall
command
the
reserve.”

“I
shall
not
fail
you,
Your
Grace,”
Lord
Estermont
replied.

Lord
Mathis
Rowan
spoke
up.
“Who
shall
have
the
van?”

“Your
Grace,”
said
Ser
Jon
Fossoway,
“I
beg
the
honor.”

“Beg
all
you
like,”
said
Ser
Guyard
the
Green,
“by
rights
it
should
be
one
of
the
seven
who
strikes
the
first
blow.”

“It
takes
more
than
a
pretty
cloak
to
charge
a
shield
wall,”
Randyll
Tarly
announced.
“I
was
leading
Mace
Tyrell’s
van
when
you
were
still
sucking
on
your
mother’s
teat,
Guyard.”

A
clamor
filled
the
pavilion,
as
other
men
loudly
set
forth
their
claims.
The
knights
of
summer,
Catelyn
thought.
Renly
raised
a
hand.
“Enough,
my
lords.
If
I
had
a
dozen
vans,
all
of
you
should
have
one,
but
the
greatest
glory
by
rights
belongs
to
the
greatest
knight.
Ser
Loras
shall
strike
the
first
blow.”

“With
a
glad
heart,
Your
Grace.”
The
Knight
of
Flowers
knelt
before
the
king.
“Grant
me
your
blessing,
and
a
knight
to
ride
beside
me
with
your
banner.
Let
the
stag
and
rose
go
to
battle
side
by
side.”

Renly
glanced
about
him.
“Brienne.”

“Your
Grace?”
She
was
still
armored
in
her
blue
steel,
though
she
had
taken
off
her
helm.
The
crowded
tent
was
hot,
and
sweat
plastered
limp
yellow
hair
to
her
broad,
homely
face.
“My
place
is
at
your
side.
I
am
your
sworn
shield…”

“One
of
seven,”
the
king
reminded
her.
“Never
fear,
four
of
your
fellows
will
be
with
me
in
the
fight.”

Brienne
dropped
to
her
knees.
“If
I
must
part
from
Your
Grace,
grant
me
the
honor
of
arming
you
for
battle.”

Catelyn
heard
someone
snigger
behind
her.
She
loves
him,
poor
thing,
she
thought
sadly.
She’d
play
his
squire
just
to
touch
him,
and
never
care
how
great
a
fool
they
think
her.

“Granted,”
Renly
said.
“Now
leave
me,
all
of
you.
Even
kings
must
rest
before
a
battle.”

“My
lord,”
Catelyn
said,
“there
was
a
small
sept
in
the
last
village
we
passed.
If
you
will
not
permit
me
to
depart
for
Riverrun,
grant
me
leave
to
go
there
and
pray.”

“As
you
will.
Ser
Robar,
give
Lady
Stark
safe
escort
to
this
sept…
but
see
that
she
returns
to
us
by
dawn.”

“You
might
do
well
to
pray
yourself,”
Catelyn
added.

“For
victory?”

“For
wisdom.”

Renly
laughed.
“Loras,
stay
and
help
me
pray.
It’s
been
so
long
I’ve
quite
forgotten
how.
As
to
the
rest
of
you,
I
want
every
man
in
place
by
first
light,
armed,
armored,
and
horsed.
We
shall
give
Stannis
a
dawn
he
will
not
soon
forget.”

Dusk
was
falling
when
Catelyn
left
the
pavilion.
Ser
Robar
Royce
fell
in
beside
her.
She
knew
him
slightly—one
of
Bronze
Yohn’s
sons,
comely
in
a
rough-hewn
way,
a
tourney
warrior
of
some
renown.
Renly
had
gifted
him
with
a
rainbow
cloak
and
a
suit
of
blood
red
armor,
and
named
him
one
of
his
seven.
“You
are
a
long
way
from
the
Vale,
ser,”
she
told
him.

“And
you
far
from
Winterfell,
my
lady.”

“I
know
what
brought
me
here,
but
why
have
you
come?
This
is
not
your
battle,
no
more
than
it
is
mine.”

“I
made
it
my
battle
when
I
made
Renly
my
king.”

“The
Royces
are
bannermen
to
House
Arryn.”

“My
lord
father
owes
Lady
Lysa
fealty,
as
does
his
heir.
A
second
son
must
find
glory
where
he
can.”
Ser
Robar
shrugged.
“A
man
grows
weary
of
tourneys.”

He
could
not
be
older
than
one-and-twenty,
Catelyn
thought,
of
an
age
with
his
king…
but
her
king,
her
Robb,
had
more
wisdom
at
fifteen
than
this
youth
had
ever
learned.
Or
so
she
prayed.

In
Catelyn’s
small
corner
of
the
camp,
Shadd
was
slicing
carrots
into
a
kettle,
Hal
Mollen
was
dicing
with
three
of
his
Winterfell
men,
and
Lucas
Blackwood
sat
sharpening
his
dagger.
“Lady
Stark,”
Lucas
said
when
he
saw
her,
“Mollen
says
it
is
to
be
battle
at
dawn.”

“Hal
has
the
truth
of
it,”
she
answered.
And
a
loose
tongue
as
well,
it
would
seem.

“Do
we
fight
or
flee?”

“We
pray,
Lucas,”
she
answered
him.
“We
pray.”





SANSA

“The
longer
you
keep
him
waiting,
the
worse
it
will
go
for
you,”
Sandor
Clegane
warned
her.

Sansa
tried
to
hurry,
but
her
fingers
fumbled
at
buttons
and
knots.
The
Hound
was
always
rough-tongued,
but
something
in
the
way
he
had
looked
at
her
filled
her
with
dread.
Had
Joffrey
found
out
about
her
meetings
with
Ser
Dontos?
Please
no,
she
thought
as
she
brushed
out
her
hair.
Ser
Dontos
was
her
only
hope.
I
have
to
look
pretty,
Joff
likes
me
to
look
pretty,
he’s
always
liked
me
in
this
gown,
this
color.
She
smoothed
the
cloth
down.
The
fabric
was
tight
across
her
chest.

When
she
emerged,
Sansa
walked
on
the
Hound’s
left,
away
from
the
burned
side
of
his
face.
“Tell
me
what
I’ve
done.”

“Not
you.
Your
kingly
brother.”

“Robb’s
a
traitor.”
Sansa
knew
the
words
by
rote.
“I
had
no
part
in
whatever
he
did.”
Gods
be
good,
don’t
let
it
be
the
Kingslayer.
If
Robb
had
harmed
Jaime
Lannister,
it
would
mean
her
life.
She
thought
of
Ser
Ilyn,
and
how
those
terrible
pale
eyes
staring
pitilessly
out
of
that
gaunt
pockmarked
face.

The
Hound
snorted.
“They
trained
you
well,
little
bird.”
He
conducted
her
to
the
lower
bailey,
where
a
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
archery
butts.
Men
moved
aside
to
let
them
through.
She
could
hear
Lord
Gyles
coughing.
Loitering
stablehands
eyed
her
insolently,
but
Ser
Horas
Redwyne
averted
his
gaze
as
she
passed,
and
his
brother
Hobber
pretended
not
to
see
her.
A
yellow
cat
was
dying
on
the
ground,
mewling
piteously,
a
crossbow
quarrel
through
its
ribs.
Sansa
stepped
around
it,
feeling
ill.

Ser
Dontos
approached
on
his
broomstick
horse;
since
he’d
been
too
drunk
to
mount
his
destrier
at
the
tourney,
the
king
had
decreed
that
henceforth
he
must
always
go
horsed.
“Be
brave,”
he
whispered,
squeezing
her
arm.

Joffrey
stood
in
the
center
of
the
throng,
winding
an
ornate
crossbow.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
were
with
him.
The
sight
of
them
was
enough
to
tie
her
insides
in
knots.

“Your
Grace.”
She
fell
to
her
knees.

“Kneeling
won’t
save
you
now,”
the
king
said.
“Stand
up.
You’re
here
to
answer
for
your
brother’s
latest
treasons.”

“Your
Grace,
whatever
my
traitor
brother
has
done,
I
had
no
part.
You
know
that,
I
beg
you,
please—”

“Get
her
up!”

The
Hound
pulled
her
to
her
feet,
not
ungently.

“Ser
Lancel,”
Joff
said,
“tell
her
of
this
outrage.”

Sansa
had
always
thought
Lancel
Lannister
comely
and
well
spoken,
but
there
was
neither
pity
nor
kindness
in
the
look
he
gave
her.
“Using
some
vile
sorcery,
your
brother
fell
upon
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
with
an
army
of
wargs,
not
three
days
ride
from
Lannisport.
Thousands
of
good
men
were
butchered
as
they
slept,
without
the
chance
to
lift
sword.
After
the
slaughter,
the
northmen
feasted
on
the
flesh
of
the
slain.”

Horror
coiled
cold
hands
around
Sansa’s
throat.

“You
have
nothing
to
say?”
asked
Joffrey.

“Your
Grace,
the
poor
child
is
shocked
witless,”
murmured
Ser
Dontos.

“Silence,
fool.”
Joffrey
lifted
his
crossbow
and
pointed
it
at
her
face.
“You
Starks
are
as
unnatural
as
those
wolves
of
yours.
I’ve
not
forgotten
how
your
monster
savaged
me.”

“That
was
Arya’s
wolf,”
she
said.
“Lady
never
hurt
you,
but
you
killed
her
anyway.”

“No,
your
father
did,”
Joff
said,
“but
I
killed
your
father.
I
wish
I’d
done
it
myself.
I
killed
a
man
last
night
who
was
bigger
than
your
father.
They
came
to
the
gate
shouting
my
name
and
calling
for
bread
like
I
was
some
baker,
but
I
taught
them
better.
I
shot
the
loudest
one
right
through
the
throat.”

“And
he
died?”
With
the
ugly
iron
head
of
the
quarrel
staring
her
in
the
face,
it
was
hard
to
think
what
else
to
say.

“Of
course
he
died,
he
had
my
quarrel
in
his
throat.
There
was
a
woman
throwing
rocks,
I
got
her
as
well,
but
only
in
the
arm.”
Frowning,
he
lowered
the
crossbow.
“I’d
shoot
you
too,
but
if
I
do
Mother
says
they’d
kill
my
uncle
Jaime.
Instead
you’ll
just
be
punished
and
we’ll
send
word
to
your
brother
about
what
will
happen
to
you
if
he
doesn’t
yield.
Dog,
hit
her.”

“Let
me
beat
her!”
Ser
Dontos
shoved
forward,
tin
armor
clattering.
He
was
armed
with
a
“morningstar”
whose
head
was
a
melon.
My
Florian.
She
could
have
kissed
him,
blotchy
skin
and
broken
veins
and
all.
He
trotted
his
broomstick
around
her,
shouting
“Traitor,
traitor”
and
whacking
her
over
the
head
with
the
melon.
Sansa
covered
herself
with
her
hands,
staggering
every
time
the
fruit
pounded
her,
her
hair
sticky
by
the
second
blow.
People
were
laughing.
The
melon
flew
to
pieces.
Laugh,
Joffrey,
she
prayed
as
the
juice
ran
down
her
face
and
the
front
of
her
blue
silk
gown.
Laugh
and
be
satisfied.

Joffrey
did
not
so
much
as
snigger.
“Boros.
Meryn.”

Ser
Meryn
Trant
seized
Dontos
by
the
arm
and
flung
him
brusquely
away.
The
red-faced
fool
went
sprawling,
broomstick,
melon,
and
all.
Ser
Boros
seized
Sansa.

“Leave
her
face,”
Joffrey
commanded.
“I
like
her
pretty.”

Boros
slammed
a
fist
into
Sansa’s
belly,
driving
the
air
out
of
her.
When
she
doubled
over,
the
knight
grabbed
her
hair
and
drew
his
sword,
and
for
one
hideous
instant
she
was
certain
he
meant
to
open
her
throat.
As
he
laid
the
flat
of
the
blade
across
her
thighs,
she
thought
her
legs
might
break
from
the
force
of
the
blow.
Sansa
screamed.
Tears
welled
in
her
eyes.
It
will
be
over
soon.
She
soon
lost
count
of
the
blows.

“Enough,”
she
heard
the
Hound
rasp.

“No
it
isn’t,”
the
king
replied.
“Boros,
make
her
naked.”

Boros
shoved
a
meaty
hand
down
the
front
of
Sansa’s
bodice
and
gave
a
hard
yank.
The
silk
came
tearing
away,
baring
her
to
the
waist.
Sansa
covered
her
breasts
with
her
hands.
She
could
hear
sniggers,
far
off
and
cruel.
“Beat
her
bloody,”
Joffrey
said,
“we’ll
see
how
her
brother
fancies—”

“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?”

The
Imp’s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip,
and
suddenly
Sansa
was
free.
She
stumbled
to
her
knees,
arms
crossed
over
her
chest,
her
breath
ragged.
“Is
this
your
notion
of
chivalry,
Ser
Boros?”
Tyrion
Lannister
demanded
angrily.
His
pet
sellsword
stood
with
him,
and
one
of
his
wildlings,
the
one
with
the
burned
eye.
“What
sort
of
knight
beats
helpless
maids?”

“The
sort
who
serves
his
king,
Imp.”
Ser
Boros
raised
his
sword,
and
Ser
Meryn
stepped
up
beside
him,
his
blade
scraping
clear
of
its
scabbard.

“Careful
with
those,”
warned
the
dwarf’s
sellsword.
“You
don’t
want
to
get
blood
all
over
those
pretty
white
cloaks.”

“Someone
give
the
girl
something
to
cover
herself
with,”
the
Imp
said.
Sandor
Clegane
unfastened
his
cloak
and
tossed
it
at
her.
Sansa
clutched
it
against
her
chest,
fists
bunched
hard
in
the
white
wool.
The
coarse
weave
was
scratchy
against
her
skin,
but
no
velvet
had
ever
felt
so
fine.

“This
girl’s
to
be
your
queen,”
the
Imp
told
Joffrey.
“Have
you
no
regard
for
her
honor?”

“I’m
punishing
her.”

“For
what
crime?
She
did
not
fight
her
brother’s
battle.”

“She
has
the
blood
of
a
wolf.”

“And
you
have
the
wits
of
a
goose.”

“You
can’t
talk
to
me
that
way.
The
king
can
do
as
he
likes.”

“Aerys
Targaryen
did
as
he
liked.
Has
your
mother
ever
told
you
what
happened
to
him?”

Ser
Boros
Blount
harrumphed.
“No
man
threatens
His
Grace
in
the
presence
of
the
Kingsguard.”

Tyrion
Lannister
raised
an
eyebrow.
“I
am
not
threatening
the
king,
ser,
I
am
educating
my
nephew.
Bronn,
Timett,
the
next
time
Ser
Boros
opens
his
mouth,
kill
him.”
The
dwarf
smiled.
“Now
that
was
a
threat,
ser.
See
the
difference?”

Ser
Boros
turned
a
dark
shade
of
red.
“The
queen
will
hear
of
this!”

“No
doubt
she
will.
And
why
wait?
Joffrey,
shall
we
send
for
your
mother?
“

The
king
flushed.

“Nothing
to
say,
Your
Grace?”
his
uncle
went
on.
“Good.
Learn
to
use
your
ears
more
and
your
mouth
less,
or
your
reign
will
be
shorter
than
I
am.
Wanton
brutality
is
no
way
to
win
your
people’s
love…
or
your
queen’s.”

“Fear
is
better
than
love,
Mother
says.”
Joffrey
pointed
at
Sansa.
“She
fears
me.”

The
Imp
sighed.
“Yes,
I
see.
A
pity
Stannis
and
Renly
aren’t
twelve-year-old
girls
as
well.
Bronn,
Timett,
bring
her.”

Sansa
moved
as
if
in
a
dream.
She
thought
the
Imp’s
men
would
take
her
back
to
her
bedchamber
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
but
instead
they
conducted
her
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
She
had
not
set
foot
inside
that
place
since
the
day
her
father
fell
from
grace,
and
it
made
her
feel
faint
to
climb
those
steps
again.

Some
serving
girls
took
charge
of
her,
mouthing
meaningless
comforts
to
stop
her
shaking.
One
stripped
off
the
ruins
of
her
gown
and
smallclothes,
and
another
bathed
her
and
washed
the
sticky
juice
from
her
face
and
her
hair.
As
they
scrubbed
her
down
with
soap
and
sluiced
warm
water
over
her
head,
all
she
could
see
were
the
faces
from
the
bailey.
Knights
are
sworn
to
defend
the
weak,
protect
women,
and
fight
for
the
right,
but
none
of
them
did
a
thing.
Only
Ser
Dontos
had
tried
to
help,
and
he
was
no
longer
a
knight,
no
more
than
the
Imp
was,
nor
the
Hound…
the
Hound
hated
knights…
I
hate
them
too,
Sansa
thought.
They
are
no
true
knights,
not
one
of
them.

After
she
was
clean,
plump
ginger-headed
Maester
Frenken
came
to
see
her.
He
bid
her
lie
facedown
on
the
mattress
while
he
spread
a
salve
across
the
angry
red
welts
that
covered
the
backs
of
her
legs.
Afterward
he
mixed
her
a
draught
of
dreamwine,
with
some
honey
so
it
might
go
down
easier.
“Sleep
a
bit,
child.
When
you
wake,
all
this
will
seem
a
bad
dream.”

No
it
won’t,
you
stupid
man,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
drank
the
drearnwine
anyway,
and
slept.

It
was
dark
when
she
woke
again,
not
quite
knowing
where
she
was,
the
room
both
strange
and
strangely
familiar.
As
she
rose,
a
stab
of
pain
went
through
her
legs
and
brought
it
all
back.
Tears
filled
her
eyes.
Someone
had
laid
out
a
robe
for
her
beside
the
bed.
Sansa
slipped
it
on
and
opened
the
door.
Outside
stood
a
hard-faced
woman
with
leathery
brown
skin,
three
necklaces
looped
about
her
scrawny
neck.
One
was
gold
and
one
was
silver
and
one
was
made
of
human
ears.
“Where
does
she
think
she’s
going?”
the
woman
asked,
leaning
on
a
tall
spear.

“The
godswood.”
She
had
to
find
Ser
Dontos,
beg
him
to
take
her
home
now
before
it
was
too
late.

“The
halfman
said
you’re
not
to
leave,”
the
woman
said.
“Pray
here,
the
gods
will
hear.”

Meekly,
Sansa
dropped
her
eyes
and
retreated
back
inside.
She
realized
suddenly
why
this
place
seemed
so
familiar.
They’ve
put
me
in
Arya’s
old
bedchamber,
from
when
Father
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.
All
her
things
are
gone
and
the
furnishings
have
been
moved
around,
but
it’s
the
same…

A
short
time
later,
a
serving
girl
brought
a
platter
of
cheese
and
bread
and
olives,
with
a
flagon
of
cold
water.
“Take
it
away,”
Sansa
commanded,
but
the
girl
left
the
food
on
a
table.
She
was
thirsty,
she
realized.
Every
step
sent
knives
through
her
thighs,
but
she
made
herself
cross
the
room.
She
drank
two
cups
of
water,
and
was
nibbling
on
an
olive
when
the
knock
came.

Anxiously,
she
turned
toward
the
door,
smoothed
down
the
folds
of
her
robe.
“Yes?”

The
door
opened,
and
Tyrion
Lannister
stepped
inside.
“My
lady.
I
trust
I
am
not
disturbing
you?”

“Am
I
your
prisoner?”

“My
guest.”
He
was
wearing
his
chain
of
office,
a
necklace
of
linked
golden
hands.
“I
thought
we
might
talk.”

“As
my
lord
commands.”
Sansa
found
it
hard
not
to
stare;
his
face
was
so
ugly
it
held
a
queer
fascination
for
her.

“The
food
and
garments
are
to
your
satisfaction?”
he
asked.
“If
there
is
anything
else
you
need,
you
have
only
to
ask.”

“You
are
most
kind.
And
this
morning…
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
help
me.”

“You
have
a
right
to
know
why
Joffrey
was
so
wroth.
Six
nights
gone,
your
brother
fell
upon
my
uncle
Stafford,
encamped
with
his
host
at
a
village
called
Oxcross
not
three
days
ride
from
Casterly
Rock.
Your
northerners
won
a
crushing
victory.
We
received
word
only
this
morning.”

Robb
will
kill
you
all,
she
thought,
exulting.
“It’s…
terrible,
my
lord.
My
brother
is
a
vile
traitor.”

The
dwarf
smiled
wanly.
“Well,
he’s
no
fawn,
he’s
made
that
clear
enough.”

“Ser
Lancel
said
Robb
led
an
army
of
wargs…”

The
Imp
gave
a
disdainful
bark
of
laughter.
“Ser
Lancel’s
a
wineskin
warrior
who
wouldn’t
know
a
warg
from
a
wart.
Your
brother
had
his
direwolf
with
him,
but
I
suspect
that’s
as
far
as
it
went.
The
northmen
crept
into
my
uncle’s
camp
and
cut
his
horse
lines,
and
Lord
Stark
sent
his
wolf
among
them.
Even
war-trained
destriers
went
mad.
Knights
were
trampled
to
death
in
their
pavilions,
and
the
rabble
woke
in
terror
and
fled,
casting
aside
their
weapons
to
run
the
faster.
Ser
Stafford
was
slain
as
he
chased
after
a
horse.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
drove
a
lance
through
his
chest.
Ser
Rubert
Brax
is
also
dead,
along
with
Ser
Lymond
Vikary,
Lord
Crakehall,
and
Lord
Jast.
Half
a
hundred
more
have
been
taken
captive,
including
Jast’s
sons
and
my
nephew
Martyn
Lannister.
Those
who
survived
are
spreading
wild
tales
and
swearing
that
the
old
gods
of
the
north
march
with
your
brother.”

“Then…
there
was
no
sorcery?”

Lannister
snorted.
“Sorcery
is
the
sauce
fools
spoon
over
failure
to
hide
the
flavor
of
their
own
incompetence.
My
mutton-headed
uncle
had
not
even
troubled
to
post
sentries,
it
would
seem.
His
host
was
raw—apprentice
boys,
miners,
fieldhands,
fisherfolk,
the
sweepings
of
Lannisport.
The
only
mystery
is
how
your
brother
reached
him.
Our
forces
still
hold
the
stronghold
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
and
they
swear
he
did
not
pass.”
The
dwarf
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
“Well,
Robb
Stark
is
my
father’s
bane.
Joffrey
is
mine.
Tell
me,
what
do
you
feel
for
my
kingly
nephew?”

“I
love
him
with
all
my
heart,”
Sansa
said
at
once.

“Truly?”
He
did
not
sound
convinced.
“Even
now?”

“My
love
for
His
Grace
is
greater
than
it
has
ever
been.”

The
Imp
laughed
aloud.
“Well,
someone
has
taught
you
to
lie
well.
You
may
be
grateful
for
that
one
day,
child.
You
are
a
child
still,
are
you
not?
Or
have
you
flowered?”

Sansa
blushed.
It
was
a
rude
question,
but
the
shame
of
being
stripped
before
half
the
castle
made
it
seem
like
nothing.
“No,
my
lord.”

“That’s
all
to
the
good.
If
it
gives
you
any
solace,
I
do
not
intend
that
you
ever
wed
Joffrey.
No
marriage
will
reconcile
Stark
and
Lannister
after
all
that
has
happened,
I
fear.
More’s
the
pity.
The
match
was
one
of
King
Robert’s
better
notions,
if
Joffrey
hadn’t
mucked
it
up.”

She
knew
she
ought
to
say
something,
but
the
words
caught
in
her
throat.

“You
grow
very
quiet,”
Tyrion
Lannister
observed.
“Is
this
what
you
want?
An
end
to
your
betrothal?”

“I…”
Sansa
did
not
know
what
to
say.
Is
it
a
trick?
Will
he
punish
me
if
I
tell
the
truth?
She
stared
at
the
dwarf’s
brutal
bulging
brow,
the
hard
black
eye
and
the
shrewd
green
one,
the
crooked
teeth
and
wiry
beard.
“I
only
want
to
be
loyal.”

“Loyal,”
the
dwarf
mused,
“and
far
from
any
Lannisters.
I
can
scarce
blame
you
for
that.
When
I
was
your
age,
I
wanted
the
same
thing.”
He
smiled.
“They
tell
me
you
visit
the
godswood
every
day.
What
do
you
pray
for,
Sansa?”

I
pray
for
Robb’s
victory
and
Joffrey’s
death…
and
for
home.
For
Winterfell.
“I
pray
for
an
end
to
the
fighting.”

“We’ll
have
that
soon
enough.
There
will
be
another
battle,
between
your
brother
Robb
and
my
lord
father,
and
that
will
settle
the
issue.”

Robb
will
beat
him,
Sansa
thought.
He
beat
your
uncle
and
your
brother
Jaime,
he’ll
beat
your
father
too.

It
was
as
if
her
face
were
an
open
book,
so
easily
did
the
dwarf
read
her
hopes.
“Do
not
take
Oxcross
too
much
to
heart,
my
lady,”
he
told
her,
not
unkindly.
“A
battle
is
not
a
war,
and
my
lord
father
is
assuredly
not
my
uncle
Stafford.
The
next
time
you
visit
the
godswood,
pray
that
your
brother
has
the
wisdom
to
bend
the
knee.
Once
the
north
returns
to
the
king’s
peace,
I
mean
to
send
you
home.”
He
hopped
down
off
the
window
seat
and
said,
“You
may
sleep
here
tonight.
I’ll
give
you
some
of
my
own
men
as
a
guard,
some
Stone
Crows
perhaps—”

“No,”
Sansa
blurted
out,
aghast.
If
she
was
locked
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
guarded
by
the
dwarf’s
men,
how
would
Ser
Dontos
ever
spirit
her
away
to
freedom?

“Would
you
prefer
Black
Ears?
I’ll
give
you
Chella
if
a
woman
would
make
you
more
at
ease.”

“Please,
no,
my
lord,
the
wildlings
frighten
me.”

He
grinned.
“Me
as
well.
But
more
to
the
point,
they
frighten
Joffrey
and
that
nest
of
sly
vipers
and
lickspittle
dogs
he
calls
a
Kingsguard.
With
Chella
or
Timett
by
your
side,
no
one
would
dare
offer
you
harm.”

“I
would
sooner
return
to
my
own
bed.”
A
lie
came
to
her
suddenly,
but
it
seemed
so
right
that
she
blurted
it
out
at
once.
“This
tower
was
where
my
father’s
men
were
slain.
Their
ghosts
would
give
me
terrible
dreams,
and
I
would
see
their
blood
wherever
I
looked.”

Tyrion
Lannister
studied
her
face.
“I
am
no
stranger
to
nightmares,
Sansa.
Perhaps
you
are
wiser
than
I
knew.
Permit
me
at
least
to
escort
you
safely
back
to
your
own
chambers.”
=======
SANSA

Sansa
rode
to
the
Hand’s
tourney
with
Septa
Mordane
and
Jeyne
Poole,
in
a
litter
with
curtains
of
yellow
silk
so
fine
she
could
see
right
through
them.
They
turned
the
whole
world
gold.
Beyond
the
city
walls,
a
hundred
pavilions
had
been
raised
beside
the
river,
and
the
common
folk
came
out
in
the
thousands
to
watch
the
games.
The
splendor
of
it
all
took
Sansa’s
breath
away;
the
shining
armor,
the
great
chargers
caparisoned
in
silver
and
gold,
the
shouts
of
the
crowd,
the
banners
snapping
in
the
wind…
and
the
knights
themselves,
the
knights
most
of
all.

“It
is
better
than
the
songs,”
she
whispered
when
they
found
the
places
that
her
father
had
promised
her,
among
the
high
lords
and
ladies.
Sansa
was
dressed
beautifully
that
day,
in
a
green
gown
that
brought
out
the
auburn
of
her
hair,
and
she
knew
they
were
looking
at
her
and
smiling.

They
watched
the
heroes
of
a
hundred
songs
ride
forth,
each
more
fabulous
than
the
last.
The
seven
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
took
the
field,
all
but
Jaime
Lannister
in
scaled
armor
the
color
of
milk,
their
cloaks
as
white
as
freshfallen
snow.
Ser
Jaime
wore
the
white
cloak
as
well,
but
beneath
it
he
was
shining
gold
from
head
to
foot,
with
a
lion’s-head
helm
and
a
golden
sword.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane,
the
Mountain
That
Rides,
thundered
past
them
like
an
avalanche.
Sansa
remembered
Lord
Yohn
Royce,
who
had
guested
at
Winterfell
two
years
before.
“His
armor
is
bronze,
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
old,
engraved
with
magic
runes
that
ward
him
against
harm,”
she
whispered
to
Jeyne.
Septa
Mordane
pointed
out
Lord
Jason
Mallister,
in
indigo
chased
with
silver,
the
wings
of
an
eagle
on
his
helm.
He
had
cut
down
three
of
Rhaegar’s
bannermen
on
the
Trident.
The
girls
giggled
over
the
warrior
priest
Thoros
of
Myr,
with
his
flapping
red
robes
and
shaven
head,
until
the
septa
told
them
that
he
had
once
scaled
the
walls
of
Pyke
with
a
flaming
sword
in
hand.

Other
riders
Sansa
did
not
know;
hedge
knights
from
the
Fingers
and
Highgarden
and
the
mountains
of
Dorne,
unsung
freeriders
and
new-made
squires,
the
younger
sons
of
high
lords
and
the
heirs
of
lesser
houses.
Younger
men,
most
had
done
no
great
deeds
as
yet,
but
Sansa
and
Jeyne
agreed
that
one
day
the
Seven
Kingdoms
would
resound
to
the
sound
of
their
names.
Ser
Balon
Swann.
Lord
Bryce
Caron
of
the
Marches.
Bronze
Yohn’s
heir,
Ser
Andar
Royce,
and
his
younger
brother
Ser
Robar,
their
silvered
steel
plate
filigreed
in
bronze
with
the
same
ancient
runes
that
warded
their
father.
The
twins
Ser
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber,
whose
shields
displayed
the
grape
cluster
sigil
of
the
Redwynes,
burgundy
on
blue.
Patrek
Mallister,
Lord
Jason’s
son.
Six
Freys
of
the
Crossing:
Ser
Jared,
Ser
Hosteen,
Ser
Danwell,
Ser
Emmon,
Ser
Theo,
Ser
Perwyn,
sons
and
grandsons
of
old
Lord
Walder
Frey,
and
his
bastard
son
Martyn
Rivers
as
well.

Jeyne
Poole
confessed
herself
frightened
by
the
look
of
Jalabhar
Xho,
an
exile
prince
from
the
Summer
Isles
who
wore
a
cape
of
green
and
scarlet
feathers
over
skin
as
dark
as
night,
but
when
she
saw
young
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion,
with
his
hair
like
red
gold
and
his
black
shield
slashed
by
lightning,
she
pronounced
herself
willing
to
marry
him
on
the
instant.

The
Hound
entered
the
lists
as
well,
and
so
too
the
king’s
brother,
handsome
Lord
Renly
of
Storm’s
End.
Jory,
Alyn,
and
Harwin
rode
for
Winterfell
and
the
north.
“Jory
looks
a
beggar
among
these
others,”
Septa
Mordane
sniffed
when
he
appeared.
Sansa
could
only
agree.
Jory’s
armor
was
blue-grey
plate
without
device
or
ornament,
and
a
thin
grey
cloak
hung
from
his
shoulders
like
a
soiled
rag.
Yet
he
acquitted
himself
well,
unhorsing
Horas
Redwyne
in
his
first
joust
and
one
of
the
Freys
in
his
second.
In
his
third
match,
he
rode
three
passes
at
a
freerider
named
Lothor
Brune
whose
armor
was
as
drab
as
his
own.
Neither
man
lost
his
seat,
but
Brune’s
lance
was
steadier
and
his
blows
better
placed,
and
the
king
gave
him
the
victory.
Alyn
and
Harwin
fared
less
well;
Harwin
was
unhorsed
in
his
first
tilt
by
Ser
Meryn
of
the
Kingsguard,
while
Alyn
fell
to
Ser
Balon
Swann.

The
jousting
went
all
day
and
into
the
dusk,
the
hooves
of
the
great
warhorses
pounding
down
the
lists
until
the
field
was
a
ragged
wasteland
of
torn
earth.
A
dozen
times
Jeyne
and
Sansa
cried
out
in
unison
as
riders
crashed
together,
lances
exploding
into
splinters
while
the
commons
screamed
for
their
favorites.
Jeyne
covered
her
eyes
whenever
a
man
fell,
like
a
frightened
little
girl,
but
Sansa
was
made
of
sterner
stuff.
A
great
lady
knew
how
to
behave
at
tournaments.
Even
Septa
Mordane
noted
her
composure
and
nodded
in
approval.

The
Kingslayer
rode
brilliantly.
He
overthrew
Ser
Andar
Royce
and
the
Marcher
Lord
Bryce
Caron
as
easily
as
if
he
were
riding
at
rings,
and
then
took
a
hard-fought
match
from
white-haired
Barristan
Selmy,
who
had
won
his
first
two
tilts
against
men
thirty
and
forty
years
his
junior.

Sandor
Clegane
and
his
immense
brother,
Ser
Gregor
the
Mountain,
seemed
unstoppable
as
well,
riding
down
one
foe
after
the
next
in
ferocious
style.
The
most
terrifying
moment
of
the
day
came
during
Ser
Gregor’s
second
joust,
when
his
lance
rode
up
and
struck
a
young
knight
from
the
Vale
under
the
gorget
with
such
force
that
it
drove
through
his
throat,
killing
him
instantly.
The
youth
fell
not
ten
feet
from
where
Sansa
was
seated.
The
point
of
Ser
Gregor’s
lance
had
snapped
off
in
his
neck,
and
his
life’s
blood
flowed
out
in
slow
pulses,
each
weaker
than
the
one
before.
His
armor
was
shiny
new;
a
bright
streak
of
fire
ran
down
his
outstretched
arm,
as
the
steel
caught
the
light.
Then
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud,
and
it
was
gone.
His
cloak
was
blue,
the
color
of
the
sky
on
a
clear
summer’s
day,
trimmed
with
a
border
of
crescent
moons,
but
as
his
blood
seeped
into
it,
the
cloth
darkened
and
the
moons
turned
red,
one
by
one.

Jeyne
Poole
wept
so
hysterically
that
Septa
Mordane
finally
took
her
off
to
regain
her
composure,
but
Sansa
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap,
watching
with
a
strange
fascination.
She
had
never
seen
a
man
die
before.
She
ought
to
be
crying
too,
she
thought,
but
the
tears
would
not
come.
Perhaps
she
had
used
up
all
her
tears
for
Lady
and
Bran.
It
would
be
different
if
it
had
been
Jory
or
Ser
Rodrik
or
Father,
she
told
herself.
The
young
knight
in
the
blue
cloak
was
nothing
to
her,
some
stranger
from
the
Vale
of
Arryn
whose
name
she
had
forgotten
as
soon
as
she
heard
it.
And
now
the
world
would
forget
his
name
too,
Sansa
realized;
there
would
be
no
songs
sung
for
him.
That
was
sad.

After
they
carried
off
the
body,
a
boy
with
a
spade
ran
onto
the
field
and
shoveled
dirt
over
the
spot
where
he
had
fallen,
to
cover
up
the
blood.
Then
the
jousts
resumed.

Ser
Balon
Swann
also
fell
to
Gregor,
and
Lord
Renly
to
the
Hound.
Renly
was
unhorsed
so
violently
that
he
seemed
to
fly
backward
off
his
charger,
legs
in
the
air.
His
head
hit
the
ground
with
an
audible
crack
that
made
the
crowd
gasp,
but
it
was
just
the
golden
antler
on
his
helm.
One
of
the
tines
had
snapped
off
beneath
him.
When
Lord
Renly
climbed
to
his
feet,
the
commons
cheered
wildly,
for
King
Robert’s
handsome
young
brother
was
a
great
favorite.
He
handed
the
broken
tine
to
his
conqueror
with
a
gracious
bow.
The
Hound
snorted
and
tossed
the
broken
antler
into
the
crowd,
where
the
commons
began
to
punch
and
claw
over
the
little
bit
of
gold,
until
Lord
Renly
walked
out
among
them
and
restored
the
peace.
By
then
Septa
Mordane
had
returned,
alone.
Jeyne
had
been
feeling
ill,
she
explained;
she
had
helped
her
back
to
the
castle.
Sansa
had
almost
forgotten
about
Jeyne.

Later
a
hedge
knight
in
a
checkered
cloak
disgraced
himself
by
killing
Beric
Dondarrion’s
horse,
and
was
declared
forfeit.
Lord
Beric
shifted
his
saddle
to
a
new
mount,
only
to
be
knocked
right
off
it
by
Thoros
of
Myr.
Ser
Aron
Santagar
and
Lothor
Brune
tilted
thrice
without
result;
Ser
Aron
fell
afterward
to
Lord
Jason
Mallister,
and
Brune
to
Yohn
Royce’s
younger
son,
Robar.

In
the
end
it
came
down
to
four;
the
Hound
and
his
monstrous
brother
Gregor,
Jaime
Lannister
the
Kingslayer,
and
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
the
youth
they
called
the
Knight
of
Flowers.

Ser
Loras
was
the
youngest
son
of
Mace
Tyrell,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden
and
Warden
of
the
South.
At
sixteen,
he
was
the
youngest
rider
on
the
field,
yet
he
had
unhorsed
three
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
that
morning
in
his
first
three
jousts.
Sansa
had
never
seen
anyone
so
beautiful.
His
plate
was
intricately
fashioned
and
enameled
as
a
bouquet
of
a
thousand
different
flowers,
and
his
snow-white
stallion
was
draped
in
a
blanket
of
red
and
white
roses.
After
each
victory,
Ser
Loras
would
remove
his
helm
and
ride
slowly
round
the
fence,
and
finally
pluck
a
single
white
rose
from
the
blanket
and
toss
it
to
some
fair
maiden
in
the
crowd.

His
last
match
of
the
day
was
against
the
younger
Royce.
Ser
Robar’s
ancestral
runes
proved
small
protection
as
Ser
Loras
split
his
shield
and
drove
him
from
his
saddle
to
crash
with
an
awful
clangor
in
the
dirt.
Robar
lay
moaning
as
the
victor
made
his
circuit
of
the
field.
Finally
they
called
for
a
litter
and
carried
him
off
to
his
tent,
dazed
and
unmoving.
Sansa
never
saw
it.
Her
eyes
were
only
for
Ser
Loras.
When
the
white
horse
stopped
in
front
of
her,
she
thought
her
heart
would
burst.

To
the
other
maidens
he
had
given
white
roses,
but
the
one
he
plucked
for
her
was
red.
“Sweet
lady,”
he
said,
“no
victory
is
half
so
beautiful
as
you.”
Sansa
took
the
flower
timidly,
struck
dumb
by
his
gallantry.
His
hair
was
a
mass
of
lazy
brown
curls,
his
eyes
like
liquid
gold.
She
inhaled
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
rose
and
sat
clutching
it
long
after
Ser
Loras
had
ridden
off.

When
Sansa
finally
looked
up,
a
man
was
standing
over
her,
staring.
He
was
short,
with
a
pointed
beard
and
a
silver
streak
in
his
hair,
almost
as
old
as
her
father.
“You
must
be
one
of
her
daughters,”
he
said
to
her.
He
had
grey-green
eyes
that
did
not
smile
when
his
mouth
did.
“You
have
the
Tully
look.”

“I’m
Sansa
Stark,”
she
said,
ill
at
ease.
The
man
wore
a
heavy
cloak
with
a
fur
collar,
fastened
with
a
silver
mockingbird,
and
he
had
the
effortless
manner
of
a
high
lord,
but
she
did
not
know
him.
“I
have
not
had
the
honor,
my
lord.”

Septa
Mordane
quickly
took
a
hand.
“Sweet
child,
this
is
Lord
Petyr
Baelish,
of
the
king’s
small
council.”

“Your
mother
was
my
queen
of
beauty
once,”
the
man
said
quietly.
His
breath
smelled
of
mint.
“You
have
her
hair.”
His
fingers
brushed
against
her
cheek
as
he
stroked
one
auburn
lock.
Quite
abruptly
he
turned
and
walked
away.

By
then,
the
moon
was
well
up
and
the
crowd
was
tired,
so
the
king
decreed
that
the
last
three
matches
would
be
fought
the
next
morning,
before
the
melee.
While
the
commons
began
their
walk
home,
talking
of
the
day’s
jousts
and
the
matches
to
come
on
the
morrow,
the
court
moved
to
the
riverside
to
begin
the
feast.
Six
monstrous
huge
aurochs
had
been
roasting
for
hours,
turning
slowly
on
wooden
spits
while
kitchen
boys
basted
them
with
butter
and
herbs
until
the
meat
crackled
and
spit.
Tables
and
benches
had
been
raised
outside
the
pavilions,
piled
high
with
sweetgrass
and
strawberries
and
fresh-baked
bread.

Sansa
and
Septa
Mordane
were
given
places
of
high
honor,
to
the
left
of
the
raised
dais
where
the
king
himself
sat
beside
his
queen.
When
Prince
Joffrey
seated
himself
to
her
right,
she
felt
her
throat
tighten.
He
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
her
since
the
awful
thing
had
happened,
and
she
had
not
dared
to
speak
to
him.
At
first
she
thought
she
hated
him
for
what
they’d
done
to
Lady,
but
after
Sansa
had
wept
her
eyes
dry,
she
told
herself
that
it
had
not
been
Joffrey’s
doing,
not
truly.
The
queen
had
done
it;
she
was
the
one
to
hate,
her
and
Arya.
Nothing
bad
would
have
happened
except
for
Arya.

She
could
not
hate
Joffrey
tonight.
He
was
too
beautiful
to
hate.
He
wore
a
deep
blue
doublet
studded
with
a
double
row
of
golden
lion’s
heads,
and
around
his
brow
a
slim
coronet
made
of
gold
and
sapphires.
His
hair
was
as
bright
as
the
metal.
Sansa
looked
at
him
and
trembled,
afraid
that
he
might
ignore
her
or,
worse,
turn
hateful
again
and
send
her
weeping
from
the
table.

Instead
Joffrey
smiled
and
kissed
her
hand,
handsome
and
gallant
as
any
prince
in
the
songs,
and
said,
“Ser
Loras
has
a
keen
eye
for
beauty,
sweet
lady.”

“He
was
too
kind,”
she
demurred,
trying
to
remain
modest
and
calm,
though
her
heart
was
singing.
“Ser
Loras
is
a
true
knight.
Do
you
think
he
will
win
tomorrow,
my
lord?”

“No,”
Joffrey
said.
“My
dog
will
do
for
him,
or
perhaps
my
uncle
Jaime.
And
in
a
few
years,
when
I
am
old
enough
to
enter
the
lists,
I
shall
do
for
them
all.”
He
raised
his
hand
to
summon
a
servant
with
a
flagon
of
iced
summerwine,
and
poured
her
a
cup.
She
looked
anxiously
at
Septa
Mordane,
until
Joffrey
leaned
over
and
filled
the
septa’s
cup
as
well,
so
she
nodded
and
thanked
him
graciously
and
said
not
another
word.

The
servants
kept
the
cups
filled
all
night,
yet
afterward
Sansa
could
not
recall
ever
tasting
the
wine.
She
needed
no
wine.
She
was
drunk
on
the
magic
of
the
night,
giddy
with
glamour,
swept
away
by
beauties
she
had
dreamt
of
all
her
life
and
never
dared
hope
to
know.
Singers
sat
before
the
king’s
pavilion,
filling
the
dusk
with
music.
A
juggler
kept
a
cascade
of
burning
clubs
spinning
through
the
air.
The
king’s
own
fool,
the
pie-faced
simpleton
called
Moon
Boy,
danced
about
on
stilts,
all
in
motley,
making
mock
of
everyone
with
such
deft
cruelty
that
Sansa
wondered
if
he
was
simple
after
all.
Even
Septa
Mordane
was
helpless
before
him;
when
he
sang
his
little
song
about
the
High
Septon,
she
laughed
so
hard
she
spilled
wine
on
herself.

And
Joffrey
was
the
soul
of
courtesy.
He
talked
to
Sansa
all
night,
showering
her
with
compliments,
making
her
laugh,
sharing
little
bits
of
court
gossip,
explaining
Moon
Boy’s
japes.
Sansa
was
so
captivated
that
she
quite
forgot
all
her
courtesies
and
ignored
Septa
Mordane,
seated
to
her
left.

All
the
while
the
courses
came
and
went.
A
thick
soup
of
barley
and
venison.
Salads
of
sweetgrass
and
spinach
and
plums,
sprinkled
with
crushed
nuts.
Snails
in
honey
and
garlic.
Sansa
had
never
eaten
snails
before;
Joffrey
showed
her
how
to
get
the
snail
out
of
the
shell,
and
fed
her
the
first
sweet
morsel
himself.
Then
came
trout
fresh
from
the
river,
baked
in
clay;
her
prince
helped
her
crack
open
the
hard
casing
to
expose
the
flaky
white
flesh
within.
And
when
the
meat
course
was
brought
out,
he
served
her
himself,
slicing
a
queen’s
portion
from
the
joint,
smiling
as
he
laid
it
on
her
plate.
She
could
see
from
the
way
he
moved
that
his
right
arm
was
still
troubling
him,
yet
he
uttered
not
a
word
of
complaint.

Later
came
sweetbreads
and
pigeon
pie
and
baked
apples
fragrant
with
cinnamon
and
lemon
cakes
frosted
in
sugar,
but
by
then
Sansa
was
so
stuffed
that
she
could
not
manage
more
than
two
little
lemon
cakes,
as
much
as
she
loved
them.
She
was
wondering
whether
she
might
attempt
a
third
when
the
king
began
to
shout.

King
Robert
had
grown
louder
with
each
course.
From
time
to
time
Sansa
could
hear
him
laughing
or
roaring
a
command
over
the
music
and
the
clangor
of
plates
and
cutlery,
but
they
were
too
far
away
for
her
to
make
out
his
words.

Now
everybody
heard
him.
“No,”
he
thundered
in
a
voice
that
drowned
out
all
other
speech.
Sansa
was
shocked
to
see
the
king
on
his
feet,
red
of
face,
reeling.
He
had
a
goblet
of
wine
in
one
hand,
and
he
was
drunk
as
a
man
could
be.
“You
do
not
tell
me
what
to
do,
woman,”
he
screamed
at
Queen
Cersei.
“I
am
king
here,
do
you
understand?
I
rule
here,
and
if
I
say
that
I
will
fight
tomorrow,
I
will
fight!”

Everyone
was
staring.
Sansa
saw
Ser
Barristan,
and
the
king’s
brother
Renly,
and
the
short
man
who
had
talked
to
her
so
oddly
and
touched
her
hair,
but
no
one
made
a
move
to
interfere.
The
queen’s
face
was
a
mask,
so
bloodless
that
it
might
have
been
sculpted
from
snow.
She
rose
from
the
table,
gathered
her
skirts
around
her,
and
stormed
off
in
silence,
servants
trailing
behind.

Jaime
Lannister
put
a
hand
on
the
king’s
shoulder,
but
the
king
shoved
him
away
hard.
Lannister
stumbled
and
fell.
The
king
guffawed.
“The
great
knight.
I
can
still
knock
you
in
the
dirt.
Remember
that,
Kingslayer.”
He
slapped
his
chest
with
the
jeweled
goblet,
splashing
wine
all
over
his
satin
tunic.
“Give
me
my
hammer
and
not
a
man
in
the
realm
can
stand
before
me!”

Jaime
Lannister
rose
and
brushed
himself
off.
“As
you
say,
Your
Grace.”
His
voice
was
stiff.

Lord
Renly
came
forward,
smiling.
“You’ve
spilled
your
wine,
Robert.
Let
me
bring
you
a
fresh
goblet.”

Sansa
started
as
Joffrey
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm.
“It
grows
late,”
the
prince
said.
He
had
a
queer
look
on
his
face,
as
if
he
were
not
seeing
her
at
all.
“Do
you
need
an
escort
back
to
the
castle?”

“No,”
Sansa
began.
She
looked
for
Septa
Mordane,
and
was
startled
to
find
her
with
her
head
on
the
table,
snoring
soft
and
ladylike
snores.
“I
mean
to
say…
yes,
thank
you,
that
would
be
most
kind.
I
am
tired,
and
the
way
is
so
dark.
I
should
be
glad
for
some
protection.”

Joffrey
called
out,
“Dog!”

Sandor
Clegane
seemed
to
take
form
out
of
the
night,
so
quickly
did
he
appear.
He
had
exchanged
his
armor
for
a
red
woolen
tunic
with
a
leather
dog’s
head
sewn
on
the
front.
The
light
of
the
torches
made
his
burned
face
shine
a
dull
red.
“Yes,
Your
Grace?”
he
said.

“Take
my
betrothed
back
to
the
castle,
and
see
that
no
harm
befalls
her,”
the
prince
told
him
brusquely.
And
without
even
a
word
of
farewell,
Joffrey
strode
off,
leaving
her
there.

Sansa
could
feel
the
Hound
watching
her.
“Did
you
think
Joff
was
going
to
take
you
himself?”
He
laughed.
He
had
a
laugh
like
the
snarling
of
dogs
in
a
pit.
“Small
chance
of
that.”
He
pulled
her
unresisting
to
her
feet.
“Come,
you’re
not
the
only
one
needs
sleep.
I’ve
drunk
too
much,
and
I
may
need
to
kill
my
brother
tomorrow.”
He
laughed
again.

Suddenly
terrified,
Sansa
pushed
at
Septa
Mordane’s
shoulder,
hoping
to
wake
her,
but
she
only
snored
the
louder.
King
Robert
had
stumbled
off
and
half
the
benches
were
suddenly
empty.
The
feast
was
over,
and
the
beautiful
dream
had
ended
with
it.

The
Hound
snatched
up
a
torch
to
light
their
way.
Sansa
followed
close
beside
him.
The
ground
was
rocky
and
uneven;
the
flickering
light
made
it
seem
to
shift
and
move
beneath
her.
She
kept
her
eyes
lowered,
watching
where
she
placed
her
feet.
They
walked
among
the
pavilions,
each
with
its
banner
and
its
armor
hung
outside,
the
silence
weighing
heavier
with
every
step.
Sansa
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
him,
he
frightened
her
so,
yet
she
had
been
raised
in
all
the
ways
of
courtesy.
A
true
lady
would
not
notice
his
face,
she
told
herself.
“You
rode
gallantly
today,
Ser
Sandor,”
she
made
herself
say.

Sandor
Clegane
snarled
at
her.
“Spare
me
your
empty
little
compliments,
girl…
and
your
ser’s.
I
am
no
knight.
I
spit
on
them
and
their
vows.
My
brother
is
a
knight.
Did
you
see
him
ride
today?”

“Yes,”
Sansa
whispered,
trembling.
“He
was…

“Gallant?”
the
Hound
finished.

He
was
mocking
her,
she
realized.
“No
one
could
withstand
him,”
she
managed
at
last,
proud
of
herself.
It
was
no
lie.

Sandor
Clegane
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
and
empty
field.
She
had
no
choice
but
to
stop
beside
him.
“Some
septa
trained
you
well.
You’re
like
one
of
those
birds
from
the
Summer
Isles,
aren’t
you?
A
pretty
little
talking
bird,
repeating
all
the
pretty
little
words
they
taught
you
to
recite.”

“That’s
unkind.”
Sansa
could
feel
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
chest.
“You’re
frightening
me.
I
want
to
go
now.”

“No
one
could
withstand
him,”
the
Hound
rasped.
“That’s
truth
enough.
No
one
could
ever
withstand
Gregor.
That
boy
today,
his
second
joust,
oh,
that
was
a
pretty
bit
of
business.
You
saw
that,
did
you?
Fool
boy,
he
had
no
business
riding
in
this
company.
No
money,
no
squire,
no
one
to
help
him
with
that
armor.
That
gorget
wasn’t
fastened
proper.
You
think
Gregor
didn’t
notice
that?
You
think
Ser
Gregor’s
lance
rode
up
by
chance,
do
you?
Pretty
little
talking
girl,
you
believe
that,
you’re
empty-headed
as
a
bird
for
true.
Gregor’s
lance
goes
where
Gregor
wants
it
to
go.
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me!”
Sandor
Clegane
put
a
huge
hand
under
her
chin
and
forced
her
face
up.
He
squatted
in
front
of
her,
and
moved
the
torch
close.
“There’s
a
pretty
for
you.
Take
a
good
long
stare.
You
know
you
want
to.
I’ve
watched
you
turning
away
all
the
way
down
the
kingsroad.
Piss
on
that.
Take
your
look.”

His
fingers
held
her
jaw
as
hard
as
an
iron
trap.
His
eyes
watched
hers.
Drunken
eyes,
sullen
with
anger.
She
had
to
look.

The
right
side
of
his
face
was
gaunt,
with
sharp
cheekbones
and
a
grey
eye
beneath
a
heavy
brow.
His
nose
was
large
and
hooked,
his
hair
thin,
dark.
He
wore
it
long
and
brushed
it
sideways,
because
no
hair
grew
on
the
other
side
of
that
face.

The
left
side
of
his
face
was
a
ruin.
His
ear
had
been
burned
away;
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
hole.
His
eye
was
still
good,
but
all
around
it
was
a
twisted
mass
of
scar,
slick
black
flesh
hard
as
leather,
pocked
with
craters
and
fissured
by
deep
cracks
that
gleamed
red
and
wet
when
he
moved.
Down
by
his
jaw,
you
could
see
a
hint
of
bone
where
the
flesh
had
been
seared
away.

Sansa
began
to
cry.
He
let
go
of
her
then,
and
snuffed
out
the
torch
in
the
dirt.
“No
pretty
words
for
that,
girl?
No
little
compliment
the
septa
taught
you?”
When
there
was
no
answer,
he
continued.
“Most
of
them,
they
think
it
was
some
battle.
A
siege,
a
burning
tower,
an
enemy
with
a
torch.
One
fool
asked
if
it
was
dragonsbreath.”
His
laugh
was
softer
this
time,
but
just
as
bitter.
“I’ll
tell
you
what
it
was,
girl,”
he
said,
a
voice
from
the
night,
a
shadow
leaning
so
close
now
that
she
could
smell
the
sour
stench
of
wine
on
his
breath.
“I
was
younger
than
you,
six,
maybe
seven.
A
woodcarver
set
up
shop
in
the
village
under
my
father’s
keep,
and
to
buy
favor
he
sent
us
gifts.
The
old
man
made
marvelous
toys.
I
don’t
remember
what
I
got,
but
it
was
Gregor’s
gift
I
wanted.
A
wooden
knight,
all
painted
up,
every
joint
pegged
separate
and
fixed
with
strings,
so
you
could
make
him
fight.
Gregor
is
five
years
older
than
me,
the
toy
was
nothing
to
him,
he
was
already
a
squire,
near
six
foot
tall
and
muscled
like
an
ox.
So
I
took
his
knight,
but
there
was
no
joy
to
it,
I
tell
you.
I
was
scared
all
the
while,
and
true
enough,
he
found
me.
There
was
a
brazier
in
the
room.
Gregor
never
said
a
word,
just
picked
me
up
under
his
arm
and
shoved
the
side
of
my
face
down
in
the
burning
coals
and
held
me
there
while
I
screamed
and
screamed.
You
saw
how
strong
he
is.
Even
then,
it
took
three
grown
men
to
drag
him
off
me.
The
septons
preach
about
the
seven
hells.
What
do
they
know?
Only
a
man
who’s
been
burned
knows
what
hell
is
truly
like.

“My
father
told
everyone
my
bedding
had
caught
fire,
and
our
maester
gave
me
ointments.
Ointments!
Gregor
got
his
ointments
too.
Four
years
later,
they
anointed
him
with
the
seven
oils
and
he
recited
his
knightly
vows
and
Rhaegar
Targaryen
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said,
‘Arise,
Ser
Gregor.’”

The
rasping
voice
trailed
off.
He
squatted
silently
before
her,
a
hulking
black
shape
shrouded
in
the
night,
hidden
from
her
eyes.
Sansa
could
hear
his
ragged
breathing.
She
was
sad
for
him,
she
realized.
Somehow,
the
fear
had
gone
away.

The
silence
went
on
and
on,
so
long
that
she
began
to
grow
afraid
once
more,
but
she
was
afraid
for
him
now,
not
for
herself.
She
found
his
massive
shoulder
with
her
hand.
“He
was
no
true
knight,”
she
whispered
to
him.

The
Hound
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
Sansa
stumbled
back,
away
from
him,
but
he
caught
her
arm.
“No,”
he
growled
at
her,
“no,
little
bird,
he
was
no
true
knight.”

The
rest
of
the
way
into
the
city,
Sandor
Clegane
said
not
a
word.
He
led
her
to
where
the
carts
were
waiting,
told
a
driver
to
take
them
back
to
the
Red
Keep,
and
climbed
in
after
her.
They
rode
in
silence
through
the
King’s
Gate
and
up
torchlit
city
streets.
He
opened
the
postern
door
and
led
her
into
the
castle,
his
burned
face
twitching
and
his
eyes
brooding,
and
he
was
one
step
behind
her
as
they
climbed
the
tower
stairs.
He
took
her
safe
all
the
way
to
the
corridor
outside
her
bedchamber.

“Thank
you,
my
lord,”
Sansa
said
meekly.

The
Hound
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
leaned
close.
“The
things
I
told
you
tonight,”
he
said,
his
voice
sounding
even
rougher
than
usual.
“If
you
ever
tell
Joffrey…
your
sister,
your
father…
any
of
them…”

“I
won’t,”
Sansa
whispered.
“I
promise.”

It
was
not
enough.
“If
you
ever
tell
anyone,”
he
finished,
“I’ll
kill
you.”





EDDARD

“I
stood
last
vigil
for
him
myself,”
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
said
as
they
looked
down
at
the
body
in
the
back
of
the
cart.
“He
had
no
one
else.
A
mother
in
the
Vale,
I
am
told.”

In
the
pale
dawn
light,
the
young
knight
looked
as
though
he
were
sleeping.
He
had
not
been
handsome,
but
death
had
smoothed
his
rough-hewn
features
and
the
silent
sisters
had
dressed
him
in
his
best
velvet
tunic,
with
a
high
collar
to
cover
the
ruin
the
lance
had
made
of
his
throat.
Eddard
Stark
looked
at
his
face,
and
wondered
if
it
had
been
for
his
sake
that
the
boy
had
died.
Slain
by
a
Lannister
bannerman
before
Ned
could
speak
to
him;
could
that
be
mere
happenstance?
He
supposed
he
would
never
know.

“Hugh
was
Jon
Arryn’s
squire
for
four
years,”
Selmy
went
on.
“The
king
knighted
him
before
he
rode
north,
in
Jon’s
memory.
The
lad
wanted
it
desperately,
yet
I
fear
he
was
not
ready.”

Ned
had
slept
badly
last
night
and
he
felt
tired
beyond
his
years.
“None
of
us
is
ever
ready,”
he
said.

“For
knighthood?”

“For
death.”
Gently
Ned
covered
the
boy
with
his
cloak,
a
bloodstained
bit
of
blue
bordered
in
crescent
moons.
When
his
mother
asked
why
her
son
was
dead,
he
reflected
bitterly,
they
would
tell
her
he
had
fought
to
honor
the
King’s
Hand,
Eddard
Stark.
“This
was
needless.
War
should
not
be
a
game.”
Ned
turned
to
the
woman
beside
the
cart,
shrouded
in
grey,
face
hidden
but
for
her
eyes.
The
silent
sisters
prepared
men
for
the
grave,
and
it
was
ill
fortune
to
look
on
the
face
of
death.
“Send
his
armor
home
to
the
Vale.
The
mother
will
want
to
have
it.”

“It
is
worth
a
fair
piece
of
silver,”
Ser
Barristan
said.
“The
boy
had
it
forged
special
for
the
tourney.
Plain
work,
but
good.
I
do
not
know
if
he
had
finished
paying
the
smith.”

“He
paid
yesterday,
my
lord,
and
he
paid
dearly,”
Ned
replied.
And
to
the
silent
sister
he
said,
“Send
the
mother
the
armor.
I
will
deal
with
this
smith.”
She
bowed
her
head.

Afterward
Ser
Barristan
walked
with
Ned
to
the
king’s
pavilion.
The
camp
was
beginning
to
stir.
Fat
sausages
sizzled
and
spit
over
firepits,
spicing
the
air
with
the
scents
of
garlic
and
pepper.
Young
squires
hurried
about
on
errands
as
their
masters
woke,
yawning
and
stretching,
to
meet
the
day.
A
serving
man
with
a
goose
under
his
arm
bent
his
knee
when
he
caught
sight
of
them.
“M’lords,”
he
muttered
as
the
goose
honked
and
pecked
at
his
fingers.
The
shields
displayed
outside
each
tent
heralded
its
occupant:
the
silver
eagle
of
Seagard,
Bryce
Caron’s
field
of
nightingales,
a
cluster
of
grapes
for
the
Redwynes,
brindled
boar,
red
ox,
burning
tree,
white
ram,
triple
spiral,
purple
unicorn,
dancing
maiden,
blackadder,
twin
towers,
horned
owl,
and
last
the
pure
white
blazons
of
the
Kingsguard,
shining
like
the
dawn.

“The
king
means
to
fight
in
the
melee
today,”
Ser
Barristan
said
as
they
were
passing
Ser
Meryn’s
shield,
its
paint
sullied
by
a
deep
gash
where
Loras
Tyrell’s
lance
had
scarred
the
wood
as
he
drove
him
from
his
saddle.

“Yes,”
Ned
said
grimly.
Jory
had
woken
him
last
night
to
bring
him
that
news.
Small
wonder
he
had
slept
so
badly.

Ser
Barristan’s
look
was
troubled.
“They
say
night’s
beauties
fade
at
dawn,
and
the
children
of
wine
are
oft
disowned
in
the
morning
light.”

“They
say
so,”
Ned
agreed,
“but
not
of
Robert.”
Other
men
might
reconsider
words
spoken
in
drunken
bravado,
but
Robert
Baratheon
would
remember
and,
remembering,
would
never
back
down.

The
king’s
pavilion
was
close
by
the
water,
and
the
morning
mists
off
the
river
had
wreathed
it
in
wisps
of
grey.
It
was
all
of
golden
silk,
the
largest
and
grandest
structure
in
the
camp.
Outside
the
entrance,
Robert’s
warhammer
was
displayed
beside
an
immense
iron
shield
blazoned
with
the
crowned
stag
of
House
Baratheon.

Ned
had
hoped
to
discover
the
king
still
abed
in
a
wine-soaked
sleep,
but
luck
was
not
with
him.
They
found
Robert
drinking
beer
from
a
polished
horn
and
roaring
his
displeasure
at
two
young
squires
who
were
trying
to
buckle
him
into
his
armor.
“Your
Grace,”
one
was
saying,
almost
in
tears,
“it’s
made
too
small,
it
won’t
go.”
He
fumbled,
and
the
gorget
he
was
trying
to
fit
around
Robert’s
thick
neck
tumbled
to
the
ground.

“Seven
hells!”
Robert
swore.
“Do
I
have
to
do
it
myself?
Piss
on
the
both
of
you.
Pick
it
up.
Don’t
just
stand
there
gaping,
Lancel,
pick
it
up!”
The
lad
jumped,
and
the
king
noticed
his
company.
“Look
at
these
oafs,
Ned.
My
wife
insisted
I
take
these
two
to
squire
for
me,
and
they’re
worse
than
useless.
Can’t
even
put
a
man’s
armor
on
him
properly.
Squires,
they
say.
I
say
they’re
swineherds
dressed
up
in
silk.”

Ned
only
needed
a
glance
to
understand
the
difficulty.
“The
boys
are
not
at
fault,”
he
told
the
king.
“You’re
too
fat
for
your
armor,
Robert.”

Robert
Baratheon
took
a
long
swallow
of
beer,
tossed
the
empty
horn
onto
his
sleeping
furs,
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand,
and
said
darkly,
“Fat?
Fat,
is
it?
Is
that
how
you
speak
to
your
king?”
He
let
go
his
laughter,
sudden
as
a
storm.
“Ah,
damn
you,
Ned,
why
are
you
always
right?”

The
squires
smiled
nervously
until
the
king
turned
on
them.
“You.
Yes,
both
of
you.
You
heard
the
Hand.
The
king
is
too
fat
for
his
armor.
Go
find
Ser
Aron
Santagar.
Tell
him
I
need
the
breastplate
stretcher.
Now!
What
are
you
waiting
for?”

The
boys
tripped
over
each
other
in
their
haste
to
be
quit
of
the
tent.
Robert
managed
to
keep
a
stern
face
until
they
were
gone.
Then
he
dropped
back
into
a
chair,
shaking
with
laughter.

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
chuckled
with
him.
Even
Eddard
Stark
managed
a
smile.
Always,
though,
the
graver
thoughts
crept
in.
He
could
not
help
taking
note
of
the
two
squires:
handsome
boys,
fair
and
well
made.
One
was
Sansa’s
age,
with
long
golden
curls;
the
other
perhaps
fifteen,
sandy-haired,
with
a
wisp
of
a
mustache
and
the
emerald-green
eyes
of
the
queen.

“Ah,
I
wish
I
could
be
there
to
see
Santagar’s
face,”
Robert
said.
“I
hope
he’ll
have
the
wit
to
send
them
to
someone
else.
We
ought
to
keep
them
running
all
day!”

“Those
boys,”
Ned
asked
him.
“Lannisters?”

Robert
nodded,
wiping
tears
from
his
eyes.
“Cousins.
Sons
of
Lord
Tywin’s
brother.
One
of
the
dead
ones.
Or
perhaps
the
live
one,
now
that
I
come
to
think
on
it.
I
don’t
recall.
My
wife
comes
from
a
very
large
family,
Ned.”

A
very
ambitious
family,
Ned
thought.
He
had
nothing
against
the
squires,
but
it
troubled
him
to
see
Robert
surrounded
by
the
queen’s
kin,
waking
and
sleeping.
The
Lannister
appetite
for
offices
and
honors
seemed
to
know
no
bounds.
“The
talk
is
you
and
the
queen
had
angry
words
last
night.”

The
mirth
curdled
on
Robert’s
face.
“The
woman
tried
to
forbid
me
to
fight
in
the
melee.
She’s
sulking
in
the
castle
now,
damn
her.
Your
sister
would
never
have
shamed
me
like
that.”

“You
never
knew
Lyanna
as
I
did,
Robert,”
Ned
told
him.
“You
saw
her
beauty,
but
not
the
iron
underneath.
She
would
have
told
you
that
you
have
no
business
in
the
melee.”

“You
too?”
The
king
frowned.
“You
are
a
sour
man,
Stark.
Too
long
in
the
north,
all
the
juices
have
frozen
inside
you.
Well,
mine
are
still
running.”
He
slapped
his
chest
to
prove
it.

“You
are
the
king,”
Ned
reminded
him.

“I
sit
on
the
damn
iron
seat
when
I
must.
Does
that
mean
I
don’t
have
the
same
hungers
as
other
men?
A
bit
of
wine
now
and
again,
a
girl
squealing
in
bed,
the
feel
of
a
horse
between
my
legs?
Seven
hells,
Ned,
I
want
to
hit
someone.”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
spoke
up.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said,
“it
is
not
seemly
that
the
king
should
ride
into
the
melee.
It
would
not
be
a
fair
contest.
Who
would
dare
strike
you?”

Robert
seemed
honestly
taken
aback.
“Why,
all
of
them,
damn
it.
If
they
can.
And
the
last
man
left
standing…”

“…will
be
you,”
Ned
finished.
He
saw
at
once
that
Selmy
had
hit
the
mark.
The
dangers
of
the
melee
were
only
a
savor
to
Robert,
but
this
touched
on
his
pride.
“Ser
Barristan
is
right.
There’s
not
a
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
would
dare
risk
your
displeasure
by
hurting
you.”

The
king
rose
to
his
feet,
his
face
flushed.
“Are
you
telling
me
those
prancing
cravens
will
let
me
win?”

“For
a
certainty,”
Ned
said,
and
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
bowed
his
head
in
silent
accord.

For
a
moment
Robert
was
so
angry
he
could
not
speak.
He
strode
across
the
tent,
whirled,
strode
back,
his
face
dark
and
angry.
He
snatched
up
his
breastplate
from
the
ground
and
threw
it
at
Barristan
Selmy
in
a
wordless
fury.
Selmy
dodged.
“Get
out,”
the
king
said
then,
coldly.
“Get
out
before
I
kill
you.”

Ser
Barristan
left
quickly.
Ned
was
about
to
follow
when
the
king
called
out
again.
“Not
you,
Ned.”

Ned
turned
back.
Robert
took
up
his
horn
again,
filled
it
with
beer
from
a
barrel
in
the
corner,
and
thrust
it
at
Ned.
“Drink,”
he
said
brusquely.

“I’ve
no
thirst—”

“Drink.
Your
king
commands
it.”

Ned
took
the
horn
and
drank.
The
beer
was
black
and
thick,
so
strong
it
stung
the
eyes.

Robert
sat
down
again.
“Damn
you,
Ned
Stark.
You
and
Jon
Arryn,
I
loved
you
both.
What
have
you
done
to
me?
You
were
the
one
should
have
been
king,
you
or
Jon.”

“You
had
the
better
claim,
Your
Grace.”

“I
told
you
to
drink,
not
to
argue.
You
made
me
king,
you
could
at
least
have
the
courtesy
to
listen
when
I
talk,
damn
you.
Look
at
me,
Ned.
Look
at
what
kinging
has
done
to
me.
Gods,
too
fat
for
my
armor,
how
did
it
ever
come
to
this?”

“Robert…”

“Drink
and
stay
quiet,
the
king
is
talking.
I
swear
to
you,
I
was
never
so
alive
as
when
I
was
winning
this
throne,
or
so
dead
as
now
that
I’ve
won
it.
And
Cersei…
I
have
Jon
Arryn
to
thank
for
her.
I
had
no
wish
to
marry
after
Lyanna
was
taken
from
me,
but
Jon
said
the
realm
needed
an
heir.
Cersei
Lannister
would
be
a
good
match,
he
told
me,
she
would
bind
Lord
Tywin
to
me
should
Viserys
Targaryen
ever
try
to
win
back
his
father’s
throne.”
The
king
shook
his
head.
“I
loved
that
old
man,
I
swear
it,
but
now
I
think
he
was
a
bigger
fool
than
Moon
Boy.
Oh,
Cersei
is
lovely
to
look
at,
truly,
but
cold…
the
way
she
guards
her
cunt,
you’d
think
she
had
all
the
gold
of
Casterly
Rock
between
her
legs.
Here,
give
me
that
beer
if
you
won’t
drink
it.”
He
took
the
horn,
upended
it,
belched,
wiped
his
mouth.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
girl,
Ned.
Truly.
About
the
wolf,
I
mean.
My
son
was
lying,
I’d
stake
my
soul
on
it.
My
son…
you
love
your
children,
don’t
you?”

“With
all
my
heart,”
Ned
said.

“Let
me
tell
you
a
secret,
Ned.
More
than
once,
I
have
dreamed
of
giving
up
the
crown.
Take
ship
for
the
Free
Cities
with
my
horse
and
my
hammer,
spend
my
time
warring
and
whoring,
that’s
what
I
was
made
for.
The
sellsword
king,
how
the
singers
would
love
me.
You
know
what
stops
me?
The
thought
of
Joffrey
on
the
throne,
with
Cersei
standing
behind
him
whispering
in
his
ear.
My
son.
How
could
I
have
made
a
son
like
that,
Ned?”

“He’s
only
a
boy,”
Ned
said
awkwardly.
He
had
small
liking
for
Prince
Joffrey,
but
he
could
hear
the
pain
in
Robert’s
voice.
“Have
you
forgotten
how
wild
you
were
at
his
age?”

“It
would
not
trouble
me
if
the
boy
was
wild,
Ned.
You
don’t
know
him
as
I
do.”
He
sighed
and
shook
his
head.
“Ah,
perhaps
you
are
right.
Jon
despaired
of
me
often
enough,
yet
I
grew
into
a
good
king.”
Robert
looked
at
Ned
and
scowled
at
his
silence.
“You
might
speak
up
and
agree
now,
you
know.”

“Your
Grace…”
Ned
began,
carefully.

Robert
slapped
Ned
on
the
back.
“Ah,
say
that
I’m
a
better
king
than
Aerys
and
be
done
with
it.
You
never
could
lie
for
love
nor
honor,
Ned
Stark.
I’m
still
young,
and
now
that
you’re
here
with
me,
things
will
be
different.
We’ll
make
this
a
reign
to
sing
of,
and
damn
the
Lannisters
to
seven
hells.
I
smell
bacon.
Who
do
you
think
our
champion
will
be
today?
Have
you
seen
Mace
Tyrell’s
boy?
The
Knight
of
Flowers,
they
call
him.
Now
there’s
a
son
any
man
would
be
proud
to
own
to.
Last
tourney,
he
dumped
the
Kingslayer
on
his
golden
rump,
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
look
on
Cersei’s
face.
I
laughed
till
my
sides
hurt.
Renly
says
he
has
this
sister,
a
maid
of
fourteen,
lovely
as
a
dawn…”

They
broke
their
fast
on
black
bread
and
boiled
goose
eggs
and
fish
fried
up
with
onions
and
bacon,
at
a
trestle
table
by
the
river’s
edge.
The
king’s
melancholy
melted
away
with
the
morning
mist,
and
before
long
Robert
was
eating
an
orange
and
waxing
fond
about
a
morning
at
the
Eyrie
when
they
had
been
boys.
“…had
given
Jon
a
barrel
of
oranges,
remember?
Only
the
things
had
gone
rotten,
so
I
flung
mine
across
the
table
and
hit
Dacks
right
in
the
nose.
You
remember,
Redfort’s
pock-faced
squire?
He
tossed
one
back
at
me,
and
before
Jon
could
so
much
as
fart,
there
were
oranges
flying
across
the
High
Hall
in
every
direction.”
He
laughed
uproariously,
and
even
Ned
smiled,
remembering.

This
was
the
boy
he
had
grown
up
with,
he
thought;
this
was
the
Robert
Baratheon
he’d
known
and
loved.
If
he
could
prove
that
the
Lannisters
were
behind
the
attack
on
Bran,
prove
that
they
had
murdered
Jon
Arryn,
this
man
would
listen.
Then
Cersei
would
fall,
and
the
Kingslayer
with
her,
and
if
Lord
Tywin
dared
to
rouse
the
west,
Robert
would
smash
him
as
he
had
smashed
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident.
He
could
see
it
all
so
clearly.

That
breakfast
tasted
better
than
anything
Eddard
Stark
had
eaten
in
a
long
time,
and
afterward
his
smiles
came
easier
and
more
often,
until
it
was
time
for
the
tournament
to
resume.

Ned
walked
with
the
king
to
the
jousting
field.
He
had
promised
to
watch
the
final
tilts
with
Sansa;
Septa
Mordane
was
ill
today,
and
his
daughter
was
determined
not
to
miss
the
end
of
the
jousting.
As
he
saw
Robert
to
his
place,
he
noted
that
Cersei
Lannister
had
chosen
not
to
appear;
the
place
beside
the
king
was
empty.
That
too
gave
Ned
cause
to
hope.

He
shouldered
his
way
to
where
his
daughter
was
seated
and
found
her
as
the
horns
blew
for
the
day’s
first
joust.
Sansa
was
so
engrossed
she
scarcely
seemed
to
notice
his
arrival.

Sandor
Clegane
was
the
first
rider
to
appear.
He
wore
an
olive-green
cloak
over
his
soot-grey
armor.
That,
and
his
hound’s-head
helm,
were
his
only
concession
to
ornament.

“A
hundred
golden
dragons
on
the
Kingslayer,”
Littlefinger
announced
loudly
as
Jaime
Lannister
entered
the
lists,
riding
an
elegant
blood
bay
destrier.
The
horse
wore
a
blanket
of
gilded
ringmail,
and
Jaime
glittered
from
head
to
heel.
Even
his
lance
was
fashioned
from
the
golden
wood
of
the
Summer
Isles.

“Done,”
Lord
Renly
shouted
back.
“The
Hound
has
a
hungry
look
about
him
this
morning.”

“Even
hungry
dogs
know
better
than
to
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
them,”
Littlefinger
called
dryly.

Sandor
Clegane
dropped
his
visor
with
an
audible
clang
and
took
up
his
position.
Ser
Jaime
tossed
a
kiss
to
some
woman
in
the
commons,
gently
lowered
his
visor,
and
rode
to
the
end
of
the
lists.
Both
men
couched
their
lances.

Ned
Stark
would
have
loved
nothing
so
well
as
to
see
them
both
lose,
but
Sansa
was
watching
it
all
moist-eyed
and
eager.
The
hastily
erected
gallery
trembled
as
the
horses
broke
into
a
gallop.
The
Hound
leaned
forward
as
he
rode,
his
lance
rock
steady,
but
Jaime
shifted
his
seat
deftly
in
the
instant
before
impact.
Clegane’s
point
was
turned
harmlessly
against
the
golden
shield
with
the
lion
blazon,
while
his
own
hit
square.
Wood
shattered,
and
the
Hound
reeled,
fighting
to
keep
his
seat.
Sansa
gasped.
A
ragged
cheer
went
up
from
the
commons.

“I
wonder
how
I
ought
spend
your
money,”
Littlefinger
called
down
to
Lord
Renly.

The
Hound
just
managed
to
stay
in
his
saddle.
He
jerked
his
mount
around
hard
and
rode
back
to
the
lists
for
the
second
pass.
Jaime
Lannister
tossed
down
his
broken
lance
and
snatched
up
a
fresh
one,
jesting
with
his
squire.
The
Hound
spurred
forward
at
a
hard
gallop.
Lannister
rode
to
meet
him.
This
time,
when
Jaime
shifted
his
seat,
Sandor
Clegane
shifted
with
him.
Both
lances
exploded,
and
by
the
time
the
splinters
had
settled,
a
riderless
blood
bay
was
trotting
off
in
search
of
grass
while
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
rolled
in
the
dirt,
golden
and
dented.

Sansa
said,
“I
knew
the
Hound
would
win.”

Littlefinger
overheard.
“If
you
know
who’s
going
to
win
the
second
match,
speak
up
now
before
Lord
Renly
plucks
me
clean,”
he
called
to
her.
Ned
smiled.

“A
pity
the
Imp
is
not
here
with
us,”
Lord
Renly
said.
“I
should
have
won
twice
as
much.”

Jaime
Lannister
was
back
on
his
feet,
but
his
ornate
lion
helmet
had
been
twisted
around
and
dented
in
his
fall,
and
now
he
could
not
get
it
off.
The
commons
were
hooting
and
pointing,
the
lords
and
ladies
were
trying
to
stifle
their
chuckles,
and
failing,
and
over
it
all
Ned
could
hear
King
Robert
laughing,
louder
than
anyone.
Finally
they
had
to
lead
the
Lion
of
Lannister
off
to
a
blacksmith,
blind
and
stumbling.

By
then
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
was
in
position
at
the
head
of
the
lists.
He
was
huge,
the
biggest
man
that
Eddard
Stark
had
ever
seen.
Robert
Baratheon
and
his
brothers
were
all
big
men,
as
was
the
Hound,
and
back
at
Winterfell
there
was
a
simpleminded
stableboy
named
Hodor
who
dwarfed
them
all,
but
the
knight
they
called
the
Mountain
That
Rides
would
have
towered
over
Hodor.
He
was
well
over
seven
feet
tall,
closer
to
eight,
with
massive
shoulders
and
arms
thick
as
the
trunks
of
small
trees.
His
destrier
seemed
a
pony
in
between
his
armored
legs,
and
the
lance
he
carried
looked
as
small
as
a
broom
handle.

Unlike
his
brother,
Ser
Gregor
did
not
live
at
court.
He
was
a
solitary
man
who
seldom
left
his
own
lands,
but
for
wars
and
tourneys.
He
had
been
with
Lord
Tywin
when
King’s
Landing
fell,
a
new-made
knight
of
seventeen
years,
even
then
distinguished
by
his
size
and
his
implacable
ferocity.
Some
said
it
had
been
Gregor
who’d
dashed
the
skull
of
the
infant
prince
Aegon
Targaryen
against
a
wall,
and
whispered
that
afterward
he
had
raped
the
mother,
the
Dornish
princess
Elia,
before
putting
her
to
the
sword.
These
things
were
not
said
in
Gregor’s
hearing.

Ned
Stark
could
not
recall
ever
speaking
to
the
man,
though
Gregor
had
ridden
with
them
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion,
one
knight
among
thousands.
He
watched
him
with
disquiet.
Ned
seldom
put
much
stock
in
gossip,
but
the
things
said
of
Ser
Gregor
were
more
than
ominous.
He
was
soon
to
be
married
for
the
third
time,
and
one
heard
dark
whisperings
about
the
deaths
of
his
first
two
wives.
It
was
said
that
his
keep
was
a
grim
place
where
servants
disappeared
unaccountably
and
even
the
dogs
were
afraid
to
enter
the
hall.
And
there
had
been
a
sister
who
had
died
young
under
queer
circumstances,
and
the
fire
that
had
disfigured
his
brother,
and
the
hunting
accident
that
had
killed
their
father.
Gregor
had
inherited
the
keep,
the
gold,
and
the
family
estates.
His
younger
brother
Sandor
had
left
the
same
day
to
take
service
with
the
Lannisters
as
a
sworn
sword,
and
it
was
said
that
he
had
never
returned,
not
even
to
visit.

When
the
Knight
of
Flowers
made
his
entrance,
a
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd,
and
he
heard
Sansa’s
fervent
whisper,
“Oh,
he’s
so
beautiful.”
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
was
slender
as
a
reed,
dressed
in
a
suit
of
fabulous
silver
armor
polished
to
a
blinding
sheen
and
filigreed
with
twining
black
vines
and
tiny
blue
forget-me-nots.
The
commons
realized
in
the
same
instant
as
Ned
that
the
blue
of
the
flowers
came
from
sapphires;
a
gasp
went
up
from
a
thousand
throats.
Across
the
boy’s
shoulders
his
cloak
hung
heavy.
It
was
woven
of
forget-me-nots,
real
ones,
hundreds
of
fresh
blooms
sewn
to
a
heavy
woolen
cape.

His
courser
was
as
slim
as
her
rider,
a
beautiful
grey
mare,
built
for
speed.
Ser
Gregor’s
huge
stallion
trumpeted
as
he
caught
her
scent.
The
boy
from
Highgarden
did
something
with
his
legs,
and
his
horse
pranced
sideways,
nimble
as
a
dancer.
Sansa
clutched
at
his
arm.
“Father,
don’t
let
Ser
Gregor
hurt
him,”
she
said.
Ned
saw
she
was
wearing
the
rose
that
Ser
Loras
had
given
her
yesterday.
Jory
had
told
him
about
that
as
well.

“These
are
tourney
lances,”
he
told
his
daughter.
“They
make
them
to
splinter
on
impact,
so
no
one
is
hurt.”
Yet
he
remembered
the
dead
boy
in
the
cart
with
his
cloak
of
crescent
moons,
and
the
words
were
raw
in
his
throat.

Ser
Gregor
was
having
trouble
controlling
his
horse.
The
stallion
was
screaming
and
pawing
the
ground,
shaking
his
head.
The
Mountain
kicked
at
the
animal
savagely
with
an
armored
boot.
The
horse
reared
and
almost
threw
him.

The
Knight
of
Flowers
saluted
the
king,
rode
to
the
far
end
of
the
list,
and
couched
his
lance,
ready.
Ser
Gregor
brought
his
animal
to
the
line,
fighting
with
the
reins.
And
suddenly
it
began.
The
Mountain’s
stallion
broke
in
a
hard
gallop,
plunging
forward
wildly,
while
the
mare
charged
as
smooth
as
a
flow
of
silk.
Ser
Gregor
wrenched
his
shield
into
position,
juggled
with
his
lance,
and
all
the
while
fought
to
hold
his
unruly
mount
on
a
straight
line,
and
suddenly
Loras
Tyrell
was
on
him,
placing
the
point
of
his
lance
just
there,
and
in
an
eye
blink
the
Mountain
was
failing.
He
was
so
huge
that
he
took
his
horse
down
with
him
in
a
tangle
of
steel
and
flesh.

Ned
heard
applause,
cheers,
whistles,
shocked
gasps,
excited
muttering,
and
over
it
all
the
rasping,
raucous
laughter
of
the
Hound.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
reined
up
at
the
end
of
the
lists.
His
lance
was
not
even
broken.
His
sapphires
winked
in
the
sun
as
he
raised
his
visor,
smiling.
The
commons
went
mad
for
him.

In
the
middle
of
the
field,
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
disentangled
himself
and
came
boiling
to
his
feet.
He
wrenched
off
his
helm
and
slammed
it
down
onto
the
ground.
His
face
was
dark
with
fury
and
his
hair
fell
down
into
his
eyes.
“My
sword,”
he
shouted
to
his
squire,
and
the
boy
ran
it
out
to
him.
By
then
his
stallion
was
back
on
its
feet
as
well.

Gregor
Clegane
killed
the
horse
with
a
single
blow
of
such
ferocity
that
it
half
severed
the
animal’s
neck.
Cheers
turned
to
shrieks
in
a
heartbeat.
The
stallion
went
to
its
knees,
screaming
as
it
died.
By
then
Gregor
was
striding
down
the
lists
toward
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
his
bloody
sword
clutched
in
his
fist.
“Stop
him!”
Ned
shouted,
but
his
words
were
lost
in
the
roar.
Everyone
else
was
yelling
as
well,
and
Sansa
was
crying.

It
all
happened
so
fast.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
was
shouting
for
his
own
sword
as
Ser
Gregor
knocked
his
squire
aside
and
made
a
grab
for
the
reins
of
his
horse.
The
mare
scented
blood
and
reared.
Loras
Tyrell
kept
his
seat,
but
barely.
Ser
Gregor
swung
his
sword,
a
savage
two-handed
blow
that
took
the
boy
in
the
chest
and
knocked
him
from
the
saddle.
The
courser
dashed
away
in
panic
as
Ser
Loras
lay
stunned
in
the
dirt.
But
as
Gregor
lifted
his
sword
for
the
killing
blow,
a
rasping
voice
warned,
“Leave
him
be,”
and
a
steel-clad
hand
wrenched
him
away
from
the
boy.

The
Mountain
pivoted
in
wordless
fury,
swinging
his
longsword
in
a
killing
arc
with
all
his
massive
strength
behind
it,
but
the
Hound
caught
the
blow
and
turned
it,
and
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
the
two
brothers
stood
hammering
at
each
other
as
a
dazed
Loras
Tyrell
was
helped
to
safety.
Thrice
Ned
saw
Ser
Gregor
aim
savage
blows
at
the
hound’s-head
helmet,
yet
not
once
did
Sandor
send
a
cut
at
his
brother’s
unprotected
face.

It
was
the
king’s
voice
that
put
an
end
to
it…
the
king’s
voice
and
twenty
swords.
Jon
Arryn
had
told
them
that
a
commander
needs
a
good
battlefield
voice,
and
Robert
had
proved
the
truth
of
that
on
the
Trident.
He
used
that
voice
now.
“STOP
THIS
MADNESS,”
he
boomed,
“IN
THE
NAME
OF
YOUR
KING!”

The
Hound
went
to
one
knee.
Ser
Gregor’s
blow
cut
air,
and
at
last
he
came
to
his
senses.
He
dropped
his
sword
and
glared
at
Robert,
surrounded
by
his
Kingsguard
and
a
dozen
other
knights
and
guardsmen.
Wordlessly,
he
turned
and
strode
off,
shoving
past
Barristan
Selmy.
“Let
him
go,”
Robert
said,
and
as
quickly
as
that,
it
was
over.

“Is
the
Hound
the
champion
now?”
Sansa
asked
Ned.

“No,”
he
told
her.
“There
will
be
one
final
joust,
between
the
Hound
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers.”

But
Sansa
had
the
right
of
it
after
all.
A
few
moments
later
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
walked
back
onto
the
field
in
a
simple
linen
doublet
and
said
to
Sandor
Clegane,
“I
owe
you
my
life.
The
day
is
yours,
ser.”

“I
am
no
ser,”
the
Hound
replied,
but
he
took
the
victory,
and
the
champion’s
purse,
and,
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life,
the
love
of
the
commons.
They
cheered
him
as
he
left
the
lists
to
return
to
his
pavilion.

As
Ned
walked
with
Sansa
to
the
archery
field,
Littlefinger
and
Lord
Renly
and
some
of
the
others
fell
in
with
them.
“Tyrell
had
to
know
the
mare
was
in
heat,”
Littlefinger
was
saying.
“I
swear
the
boy
planned
the
whole
thing.
Gregor
has
always
favored
huge,
ill-tempered
stallions
with
more
spirit
than
sense.”
The
notion
seemed
to
amuse
him.

It
did
not
amuse
Ser
Barristan
Selmy.
“There
is
small
honor
in
tricks,”
the
old
man
said
stiffly.

“Small
honor
and
twenty
thousand
golds.”
Lord
Renly
smiled.

That
afternoon
a
boy
named
Anguy,
an
unheralded
commoner
from
the
Dornish
Marches,
won
the
archery
competition,
outshooting
Ser
Balon
Swann
and
Jalabhar
Xho
at
a
hundred
paces
after
all
the
other
bowmen
had
been
eliminated
at
the
shorter
distances.
Ned
sent
Alyn
to
seek
him
out
and
offer
him
a
position
with
the
Hand’s
guard,
but
the
boy
was
flush
with
wine
and
victory
and
riches
undreamed
of,
and
he
refused.

The
melee
went
on
for
three
hours.
Near
forty
men
took
part,
freeriders
and
hedge
knights
and
new-made
squires
in
search
of
a
reputation.
They
fought
with
blunted
weapons
in
a
chaos
of
mud
and
blood,
small
troops
fighting
together
and
then
turning
on
each
other
as
alliances
formed
and
fractured,
until
only
one
man
was
left
standing.
The
victor
was
the
red
priest,
Thoros
of
Myr,
a
madman
who
shaved
his
head
and
fought
with
a
flaming
sword.
He
had
won
melees
before;
the
fire
sword
frightened
the
mounts
of
the
other
riders,
and
nothing
frightened
Thoros.
The
final
tally
was
three
broken
limbs,
a
shattered
collarbone,
a
dozen
smashed
fingers,
two
horses
that
had
to
be
put
down,
and
more
cuts,
sprains,
and
bruises
than
anyone
cared
to
count.
Ned
was
desperately
pleased
that
Robert
had
not
taken
part.

That
night
at
the
feast,
Eddard
Stark
was
more
hopeful
than
he
had
been
in
a
great
while.
Robert
was
in
high
good
humor,
the
Lannisters
were
nowhere
to
be
seen,
and
even
his
daughters
were
behaving.
Jory
brought
Arya
down
to
join
them,
and
Sansa
spoke
to
her
sister
pleasantly.
“The
tournament
was
magnificent,”
she
sighed.
“You
should
have
come.
How
was
your
dancing?”

“I’m
sore
all
over,”
Arya
reported
happily,
proudly
displaying
a
huge
purple
bruise
on
her
leg.

“You
must
be
a
terrible
dancer,”
Sansa
said
doubtfully.

Later,
while
Sansa
was
off
listening
to
a
troupe
of
singers
perform
the
complex
round
of
interwoven
ballads
called
the
“Dance
of
the
Dragons,”
Ned
inspected
the
bruise
himself.
“I
hope
Forel
is
not
being
too
hard
on
you,”
he
said.

Arya
stood
on
one
leg.
She
was
getting
much
better
at
that
of
late.
“Syrio
says
that
every
hurt
is
a
lesson,
and
every
lesson
makes
you
better.”

Ned
frowned.
The
man
Syrio
Forel
had
come
with
an
excellent
reputation,
and
his
flamboyant
Braavosi
style
was
well
suited
to
Arya’s
slender
blade,
yet
still…
a
few
days
ago,
she
had
been
wandering
around
with
a
swatch
of
black
silk
tied
over
her
eyes.
Syrio
was
teaching
her
to
see
with
her
ears
and
her
nose
and
her
skin,
she
told
him.
Before
that,
he
had
her
doing
spins
and
back
flips.
“Arya,
are
you
certain
you
want
to
persist
in
this?”

She
nodded.
“Tomorrow
we’re
going
to
catch
cats.”

“Cats.”
Ned
sighed.
“Perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
to
hire
this
Braavosi.
If
you
like,
I
will
ask
Jory
to
take
over
your
lessons.
Or
I
might
have
a
quiet
word
with
Ser
Barristan.
He
was
the
finest
sword
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
his
youth.”

“I
don’t
want
them,”
Arya
said.
“I
want
Syrio.”

Ned
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair.
Any
decent
master-at-arms
could
give
Arya
the
rudiments
of
slash-and-parry
without
this
nonsense
of
blindfolds,
cartwheels,
and
hopping
about
on
one
leg,
but
he
knew
his
youngest
daughter
well
enough
to
know
there
was
no
arguing
with
that
stubborn
jut
of
jaw.
“As
you
wish,”
he
said.
Surely
she
would
grow
tired
of
this
soon.
“Try
to
be
careful.”

“I
will,”
she
promised
solemnly
as
she
hopped
smoothly
from
her
right
leg
to
her
left.

Much
later,
after
he
had
taken
the
girls
back
through
the
city
and
seen
them
both
safe
in
bed,
Sansa
with
her
dreams
and
Arya
with
her
bruises,
Ned
ascended
to
his
own
chambers
atop
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
The
day
had
been
warm
and
the
room
was
close
and
stuffy.
Ned
went
to
the
window
and
unfastened
the
heavy
shutters
to
let
in
the
cool
night
air.
Across
the
Great
Yard,
he
noticed
the
flickering
glow
of
candlelight
from
Littlefinger’s
windows.
The
hour
was
well
past
midnight.
Down
by
the
river,
the
revels
were
only
now
beginning
to
dwindle
and
die.

He
took
out
the
dagger
and
studied
it.
Littlefinger’s
blade,
won
by
Tyrion
Lannister
in
a
tourney
wager,
sent
to
slay
Bran
in
his
sleep.
Why?
Why
would
the
dwarf
want
Bran
dead?
Why
would
anyone
want
Bran
dead?

The
dagger,
Bran’s
fall,
all
of
it
was
linked
somehow
to
the
murder
of
Jon
Arryn,
he
could
feel
it
in
his
gut,
but
the
truth
of
Jon’s
death
remained
as
clouded
to
him
as
when
he
had
started.
Lord
Stannis
had
not
returned
to
King’s
Landing
for
the
tourney.
Lysa
Arryn
held
her
silence
behind
the
high
walls
of
the
Eyrie.
The
squire
was
dead,
and
Jory
was
still
searching
the
whorehouses.
What
did
he
have
but
Robert’s
bastard?

That
the
armorer’s
sullen
apprentice
was
the
king’s
son,
Ned
had
no
doubt.
The
Baratheon
look
was
stamped
on
his
face,
in
his
jaw,
his
eyes,
that
black
hair.
Renly
was
too
young
to
have
fathered
a
boy
of
that
age,
Stannis
too
cold
and
proud
in
his
honor.
Gendry
had
to
be
Robert’s.

Yet
knowing
all
that,
what
had
he
learned?
The
king
had
other
baseborn
children
scattered
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
He
had
openly
acknowledged
one
of
his
bastards,
a
boy
of
Bran’s
age
whose
mother
was
highborn.
The
lad
was
being
fostered
by
Lord
Renly’s
castellan
at
Storm’s
End.

Ned
remembered
Robert’s
first
child
as
well,
a
daughter
born
in
the
Vale
when
Robert
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
himself.
A
sweet
little
girl;
the
young
lord
of
Storm’s
End
had
doted
on
her.
He
used
to
make
daily
visits
to
play
with
the
babe,
long
after
he
had
lost
interest
in
the
mother.
Ned
was
often
dragged
along
for
company,
whether
he
willed
it
or
not.
The
girl
would
be
seventeen
or
eighteen
now,
he
realized;
older
than
Robert
had
been
when
he
fathered
her.
A
strange
thought.

Cersei
could
not
have
been
pleased
by
her
lord
husband’s
by-blows,
yet
in
the
end
it
mattered
little
whether
the
king
had
one
bastard
or
a
hundred.
Law
and
custom
gave
the
baseborn
few
rights.
Gendry,
the
girl
in
the
Vale,
the
boy
at
Storm’s
End,
none
of
them
could
threaten
Robert’s
trueborn
children…

His
musings
were
ended
by
a
soft
rap
on
his
door.
“A
man
to
see
you,
my
lord,”
Harwin
called.
“He
will
not
give
his
name.”

“Send
him
in,”
Ned
said,
wondering.

The
visitor
was
a
stout
man
in
cracked,
mud-caked
boots
and
a
heavy
brown
robe
of
the
coarsest
roughspun,
his
features
hidden
by
a
cowl,
his
hands
drawn
up
into
voluminous
sleeves.

“Who
are
you?”
Ned
asked.

“A
friend,”
the
cowled
man
said
in
a
strange,
low
voice.
“We
must
speak
alone,
Lord
Stark.”

Curiosity
was
stronger
than
caution.
“Harwin,
leave
us,”
he
commanded.
Not
until
they
were
alone
behind
closed
doors
did
his
visitor
draw
back
his
cowl.

“Lord
Varys?”
Ned
said
in
astonishment.

“Lord
Stark,”
Varys
said
politely,
seating
himself.
“I
wonder
if
I
might
trouble
you
for
a
drink?”

Ned
filled
two
cups
with
summerwine
and
handed
one
to
Varys.
“I
might
have
passed
within
a
foot
of
you
and
never
recognized
you,”
he
said,
incredulous.
He
had
never
seen
the
eunuch
dress
in
anything
but
silk
and
velvet
and
the
richest
damasks,
and
this
man
smelled
of
sweat
instead
of
lilacs.

“That
was
my
dearest
hope,”
Varys
said.
“It
would
not
do
if
certain
people
learned
that
we
had
spoken
in
private.
The
queen
watches
you
closely.
This
wine
is
very
choice.
Thank
you.”

“How
did
you
get
past
my
other
guards?”
Ned
asked.
Porther
and
Cayn
had
been
posted
outside
the
tower,
and
Alyn
on
the
stairs.

“The
Red
Keep
has
ways
known
only
to
ghosts
and
spiders.”
Varys
smiled
apologetically.
“I
will
not
keep
you
long,
my
lord.
There
are
things
you
must
know.
You
are
the
King’s
Hand,
and
the
king
is
a
fool.”
The
eunuch’s
cloying
tones
were
gone;
now
his
voice
was
thin
and
sharp
as
a
whip.
“Your
friend,
I
know,
yet
a
fool
nonetheless…
and
doomed,
unless
you
save
him.
Today
was
a
near
thing.
They
had
hoped
to
kill
him
during
the
melee.”

For
a
moment
Ned
was
speechless
with
shock.
“Who?”

Varys
sipped
his
wine.
“If
I
truly
need
to
tell
you
that,
you
are
a
bigger
fool
than
Robert
and
I
am
on
the
wrong
side.”

“The
Lannisters,”
Ned
said.
“The
queen…
no,
I
will
not
believe
that,
not
even
of
Cersei.
She
asked
him
not
to
fight!”

“She
forbade
him
to
fight,
in
front
of
his
brother,
his
knights,
and
half
the
court.
Tell
me
truly,
do
you
know
any
surer
way
to
force
King
Robert
into
the
melee?
I
ask
you.”

Ned
had
a
sick
feeling
in
his
gut.
The
eunuch
had
hit
upon
a
truth;
tell
Robert
Baratheon
he
could
not,
should
not,
or
must
not
do
a
thing,
and
it
was
as
good
as
done.
“Even
if
he’d
fought,
who
would
have
dared
to
strike
the
king?”

Varys
shrugged.
“There
were
forty
riders
in
the
melee.
The
Lannisters
have
many
friends.
Amidst
all
that
chaos,
with
horses
screaming
and
bones
breaking
and
Thoros
of
Myr
waving
that
absurd
firesword
of
his,
who
could
name
it
murder
if
some
chance
blow
felled
His
Grace?”
He
went
to
the
flagon
and
refilled
his
cup.
“After
the
deed
was
done,
the
slayer
would
be
beside
himself
with
grief.
I
can
almost
hear
him
weeping.
So
sad.
Yet
no
doubt
the
gracious
and
compassionate
widow
would
take
pity,
lift
the
poor
unfortunate
to
his
feet,
and
bless
him
with
a
gentle
kiss
of
forgiveness.
Good
King
Joffrey
would
have
no
choice
but
to
pardon
him.”
The
eunuch
stroked
his
cheek.
“Or
perhaps
Cersei
would
let
Ser
Ilyn
strike
off
his
head.
Less
risk
for
the
Lannisters
that
way,
though
quite
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
their
little
friend.”

Ned
felt
his
anger
rise.
“You
knew
of
this
plot,
and
yet
you
did
nothing.”

“I
command
whisperers,
not
warriors.”

“You
might
have
come
to
me
earlier.”

“Oh,
yes,
I
confess
it.
And
you
would
have
rushed
straight
to
the
king,
yes?
And
when
Robert
heard
of
his
peril,
what
would
he
have
done?
I
wonder.”

Ned
considered
that.
“He
would
have
damned
them
all,
and
fought
anyway,
to
show
he
did
not
fear
them.”

Varys
spread
his
hands.
“I
will
make
another
confession,
Lord
Eddard.
I
was
curious
to
see
what
you
would
do.
Why
not
come
to
me?
you
ask,
and
I
must
answer,
Why,
because
I
did
not
trust
you,
my
lord.”

“You
did
not
trust
me?”
Ned
was
frankly
astonished.

“The
Red
Keep
shelters
two
sorts
of
people,
Lord
Eddard,”
Varys
said.
“Those
who
are
loyal
to
the
realm,
and
those
who
are
loyal
only
to
themselves.
Until
this
morning,
I
could
not
say
which
you
might
be…
so
I
waited
to
see…
and
now
I
know,
for
a
certainty.”
He
smiled
a
plump
tight
little
smile,
and
for
a
moment
his
private
face
and
public
mask
were
one.
“I
begin
to
comprehend
why
the
queen
fears
you
so
much.
Oh,
yes
I
do.”

“You
are
the
one
she
ought
to
fear,”
Ned
said.

“No.
I
am
what
I
am.
The
king
makes
use
of
me,
but
it
shames
him.
A
most
puissant
warrior
is
our
Robert,
and
such
a
manly
man
has
little
love
for
sneaks
and
spies
and
eunuchs.
If
a
day
should
come
when
Cersei
whispers,
‘Kill
that
man,’
Ilyn
Payne
will
snick
my
head
off
in
a
twinkling,
and
who
will
mourn
poor
Varys
then?
North
or
south,
they
sing
no
songs
for
spiders.”
He
reached
out
and
touched
Ned
with
a
soft
hand.
“But
you,
Lord
Stark…
I
think…
no,
I
know…
he
would
not
kill
you,
not
even
for
his
queen,
and
there
may
lie
our
salvation.”

It
was
all
too
much.
For
a
moment
Eddard
Stark
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
return
to
Winterfell,
to
the
clean
simplicity
of
the
north,
where
the
enemies
were
winter
and
the
wildlings
beyond
the
Wall.
“Surely
Robert
has
other
loyal
friends,”
he
protested.
“His
brothers,
his—”

“—wife?”
Varys
finished,
with
a
smile
that
cut.
“His
brothers
hate
the
Lannisters,
true
enough,
but
hating
the
queen
and
loving
the
king
are
not
quite
the
same
thing,
are
they?
Ser
Barristan
loves
his
honor,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
loves
his
office,
and
Littlefinger
loves
Littlefinger.”

“The
Kingsguard—”

“A
paper
shield,”
the
eunuch
said.
“Try
not
to
look
so
shocked,
Lord
Stark.
Jaime
Lannister
is
himself
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
White
Swords,
and
we
all
know
what
his
oath
is
worth.
The
days
when
men
like
Ryam
Redwyne
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
wore
the
white
cloak
are
gone
to
dust
and
song.
Of
these
seven,
only
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
is
made
of
the
true
steel,
and
Selmy
is
old.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
are
the
queen’s
creatures
to
the
bone,
and
I
have
deep
suspicions
of
the
others.
No,
my
lord,
when
the
swords
come
out
in
earnest,
you
will
be
the
only
true
friend
Robert
Baratheon
will
have.”

“Robert
must
be
told,”
Ned
said.
“If
what
you
say
is
true,
if
even
a
part
of
it
is
true,
the
king
must
hear
it
for
himself.”

“And
what
proof
shall
we
lay
before
him?
My
words
against
theirs?
My
little
birds
against
the
queen
and
the
Kingslayer,
against
his
brothers
and
his
council,
against
the
Wardens
of
East
and
West,
against
all
the
might
of
Casterly
Rock?
Pray,
send
for
Ser
Ilyn
directly,
it
will
save
us
all
some
time.
I
know
where
that
road
ends.”

“Yet
if
what
you
say
is
true,
they
will
only
bide
their
time
and
make
another
attempt.”

“Indeed
they
will,”
said
Varys,
“and
sooner
rather
than
later,
I
do
fear.
You
are
making
them
most
anxious,
Lord
Eddard.
But
my
little
birds
will
be
listening,
and
together
we
may
be
able
to
forestall
them,
you
and
I.”
He
rose
and
pulled
up
his
cowl
so
his
face
was
hidden
once
more.
“Thank
you
for
the
wine.
We
will
speak
again.
When
you
see
me
next
at
council,
be
certain
to
treat
me
with
your
accustomed
contempt.
You
should
not
find
it
difficult.”

He
was
at
the
door
when
Ned
called,
“Varys.”
The
eunuch
turned
back.
“How
did
Jon
Arryn
die?”

“I
wondered
when
you
would
get
around
to
that.”

“Tell
me.”

“The
tears
of
Lys,
they
call
it.
A
rare
and
costly
thing,
clear
and
sweet
as
water,
and
it
leaves
no
trace.
I
begged
Lord
Arryn
to
use
a
taster,
in
this
very
room
I
begged
him,
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it.
Only
one
who
was
less
than
a
man
would
even
think
of
such
a
thing,
he
told
me.”

Ned
had
to
know
the
rest.
“Who
gave
him
the
poison?”

“Some
dear
sweet
friend
who
often
shared
meat
and
mead
with
him,
no
doubt.
Oh,
but
which
one?
There
were
many
such.
Lord
Arryn
was
a
kindly,
trusting
man.”
The
eunuch
sighed.
“There
was
one
boy.
All
he
was,
he
owed
Jon
Arryn,
but
when
the
widow
fled
to
the
Eyrie
with
her
household,
he
stayed
in
King’s
Landing
and
prospered.
It
always
gladdens
my
heart
to
see
the
young
rise
in
the
world.”
The
whip
was
in
his
voice
again,
every
word
a
stroke.
“He
must
have
cut
a
gallant
figure
in
the
tourney,
him
in
his
bright
new
armor,
with
those
crescent
moons
on
his
cloak.
A
pity
he
died
so
untimely,
before
you
could
talk
to
him…”

Ned
felt
half-poisoned
himself.
“The
squire,”
he
said.
“Ser
Hugh.”
Wheels
within
wheels
within
wheels.
Ned’s
head
was
pounding.
“Why?
Why
now?
Jon
Arryn
had
been
Hand
for
fourteen
years.
What
was
he
doing
that
they
had
to
kill
him?”

“Asking
questions,”
Varys
said,
slipping
out
the
door.





TYRION

As
he
stood
in
the
predawn
chill
watching
Chiggen
butcher
his
horse,
Tyrion
Lannister
chalked
up
one
more
debt
owed
the
Starks.
Steam
rose
from
inside
the
carcass
when
the
squat
sellsword
opened
the
belly
with
his
skinning
knife.
His
hands
moved
deftly,
with
never
a
wasted
cut;
the
work
had
to
be
done
quickly,
before
the
stink
of
blood
brought
shadowcats
down
from
the
heights.

“None
of
us
will
go
hungry
tonight,”
Bronn
said.
He
was
near
a
shadow
himself;
bone
thin
and
bone
hard,
with
black
eyes
and
black
hair
and
a
stubble
of
beard.

“Some
of
us
may,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“I
am
not
fond
of
eating
horse.
Particularly
my
horse.”

“Meat
is
meat,”
Bronn
said
with
a
shrug.
“The
Dothraki
like
horse
more
than
beef
or
pork.”

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
Dothraki?”
Tyrion
asked
sourly.
The
Dothraki
ate
horse,
in
truth;
they
also
left
deformed
children
out
for
the
feral
dogs
who
ran
behind
their
khalasars.
Dothraki
customs
had
scant
appeal
for
him.

Chiggen
sliced
a
thin
strip
of
bloody
meat
off
the
carcass
and
held
it
up
for
inspection.
“Want
a
taste,
dwarf?”

“My
brother
Jaime
gave
me
that
mare
for
my
twenty-third
name
day,”
Tyrion
said
in
a
flat
voice.

“Thank
him
for
us,
then.
If
you
ever
see
him
again.”
Chiggen
grinned,
showing
yellow
teeth,
and
swallowed
the
raw
meat
in
two
bites.
“Tastes
well
bred.”

“Better
if
you
fry
it
up
with
onions,”
Bronn
put
in.

Wordlessly,
Tyrion
limped
away.
The
cold
had
settled
deep
in
his
bones,
and
his
legs
were
so
sore
he
could
scarcely
walk.
Perhaps
his
dead
mare
was
the
lucky
one.
He
had
hours
more
riding
ahead
of
him,
followed
by
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
and
a
short,
cold
sleep
on
hard
ground,
and
then
another
night
of
the
same,
and
another,
and
another,
and
the
gods
only
knew
how
it
would
end.
“Damn
her,”
he
muttered
as
he
struggled
up
the
road
to
rejoin
his
captors,
remembering,
“damn
her
and
all
the
Starks.”

The
memory
was
still
bitter.
One
moment
he’d
been
ordering
supper,
and
an
eye
blink
later
he
was
facing
a
room
of
armed
men,
with
Jyck
reaching
for
a
sword
and
the
fat
innkeep
shrieking,
“No
swords,
not
here,
please,
m’lords.”

Tyrion
wrenched
down
Jyck’s
arm
hurriedly,
before
he
got
them
both
hacked
to
pieces.
“Where
are
your
courtesies,
Jyck?
Our
good
hostess
said
no
swords.
Do
as
she
asks.”
He
forced
a
smile
that
must
have
looked
as
queasy
as
it
felt.
“You’re
making
a
sad
mistake,
Lady
Stark.
I
had
no
part
in
any
attack
on
your
son.
On
my
honor—”

“Lannister
honor,”
was
all
she
said.
She
held
up
her
hands
for
all
the
room
to
see.
“His
dagger
left
these
scars.
The
blade
he
sent
to
open
my
son’s
throat.”

Tyrion
felt
the
anger
all
around
him,
thick
and
smoky,
fed
by
the
deep
cuts
in
the
Stark
woman’s
hands.
“Kill
him,”
hissed
some
drunken
slattern
from
the
back,
and
other
voices
took
up
the
call,
faster
than
he
would
have
believed.
Strangers
all,
friendly
enough
only
a
moment
ago,
and
yet
now
they
cried
for
his
blood
like
hounds
on
a
trail.

Tyrion
spoke
up
loudly,
trying
to
keep
the
quaver
from
his
voice.
“If
Lady
Stark
believes
I
have
some
crime
to
answer
for,
I
will
go
with
her
and
answer
for
it.”

It
was
the
only
possible
course.
Trying
to
cut
their
way
out
of
this
was
a
sure
invitation
to
an
early
grave.
A
good
dozen
swords
had
responded
to
the
Stark
woman’s
plea
for
help:
the
Harrenhal
man,
the
three
Brackens,
a
pair
of
unsavory
sellswords
who
looked
as
though
they’d
kill
him
as
soon
as
spit,
and
some
fool
field
hands
who
doubtless
had
no
idea
what
they
were
doing.
Against
that,
what
did
Tyrion
have?
A
dagger
at
his
belt,
and
two
men.
Jyck
swung
a
fair
enough
sword,
but
Morrec
scarcely
counted;
he
was
part
groom,
part
cook,
part
body
servant,
and
no
soldier.
As
for
Yoren,
whatever
his
feelings
might
have
been,
the
black
brothers
were
sworn
to
take
no
part
in
the
quarrels
of
the
realm.
Yoren
would
do
nothing.

And
indeed,
the
black
brother
stepped
aside
silently
when
the
old
knight
by
Catelyn
Stark’s
side
said,
“Take
their
weapons,”
and
the
sellsword
Bronn
stepped
forward
to
pull
the
sword
from
Jyck’s
fingers
and
relieve
them
all
of
their
daggers.
“Good,”
the
old
man
said
as
the
tension
in
the
common
room
ebbed
palpably,
“excellent.”
Tyrion
recognized
the
gruff
voice;
Winterfell’s
master-at-arms,
shorn
of
his
whiskers.

Scarlet-tinged
spittle
flew
from
the
fat
innkeep’s
mouth
as
she
begged
of
Catelyn
Stark,
“Don’t
kill
him
here!”

“Don’t
kill
him
anywhere,”
Tyrion
urged.

“Take
him
somewheres
else,
no
blood
here,
m’lady,
I
wants
no
high
lordlin’s
quarrels.”

“We
are
taking
him
back
to
Winterfell,”
she
said,
and
Tyrion
thought,
Well,
perhaps…
By
then
he’d
had
a
moment
to
glance
over
the
room
and
get
a
better
idea
of
the
situation.
He
was
not
altogether
displeased
by
what
he
saw.
Oh,
the
Stark
woman
had
been
clever,
no
doubt
of
it.
Force
them
to
make
a
public
affirmation
of
the
oaths
sworn
her
father
by
the
lords
they
served,
and
then
call
on
them
for
succor,
and
her
a
woman,
yes,
that
was
sweet.
Yet
her
success
was
not
as
complete
as
she
might
have
liked.
There
were
close
to
fifty
in
the
common
room
by
his
rough
count.
Catelyn
Stark’s
plea
had
roused
a
bare
dozen;
the
others
looked
confused,
or
frightened,
or
sullen.
Only
two
of
the
Freys
had
stirred,
Tyrion
noted,
and
they’d
sat
back
down
quick
enough
when
their
captain
failed
to
move.
He
might
have
smiled
if
he’d
dared.

“Winterfell
it
is,
then,”
he
said
instead.
That
was
a
long
ride,
as
he
could
well
attest,
having
just
ridden
it
the
other
way.
So
many
things
could
happen
along
the
way.
“My
father
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
me,”
he
added,
catching
the
eye
of
the
swordsman
who’d
offered
to
yield
up
his
room.
“He’ll
pay
a
handsome
reward
to
any
man
who
brings
him
word
of
what
happened
here
today.”
Lord
Tywin
would
do
no
such
thing,
of
course,
but
Tyrion
would
make
up
for
it
if
he
won
free.

Ser
Rodrik
glanced
at
his
lady,
his
look
worried,
as
well
it
might
be.
“His
men
come
with
him,”
the
old
knight
announced.
“And
we’ll
thank
the
rest
of
you
to
stay
quiet
about
what
you’ve
seen
here.”

It
was
all
Tyrion
could
do
not
to
laugh.
Quiet?
The
old
fool.
Unless
he
took
the
whole
inn,
the
word
would
begin
to
spread
the
instant
they
were
gone.
The
freerider
with
the
gold
coin
in
his
pocket
would
fly
to
Casterly
Rock
like
an
arrow.
If
not
him,
then
someone
else.
Yoren
would
carry
the
story
south.
That
fool
singer
might
make
a
lay
of
it.
The
Freys
would
report
back
to
their
lord,
and
the
gods
only
knew
what
he
might
do.
Lord
Walder
Frey
might
be
sworn
to
Riverrun,
but
he
was
a
cautious
man
who
had
lived
a
long
time
by
making
certain
he
was
always
on
the
winning
side.
At
the
very
least
he
would
send
his
birds
winging
south
to
King’s
Landing,
and
he
might
well
dare
more
than
that.

Catelyn
Stark
wasted
no
time.
“We
must
ride
at
once.
We’ll
want
fresh
mounts,
and
provisions
for
the
road.
You
men,
know
that
you
have
the
eternal
gratitude
of
House
Stark.
If
any
of
you
choose
to
help
us
guard
our
captives
and
get
them
safe
to
Winterfell,
I
promise
you
shall
be
well
rewarded.”
That
was
all
it
took;
the
fools
came
rushing
forward.
Tyrion
studied
their
faces;
they
would
indeed
be
well
rewarded,
he
vowed
to
himself,
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
they
imagined.

Yet
even
as
they
were
bundling
him
outside,
saddling
the
horses
in
the
rain,
and
tying
his
hands
with
a
length
of
coarse
rope,
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
truly
afraid.
They
would
never
get
him
to
Winterfell,
he
would
have
given
odds
on
that.
Riders
would
be
after
them
within
the
day,
birds
would
take
wing,
and
surely
one
of
the
river
lords
would
want
to
curry
favor
with
his
father
enough
to
take
a
hand.
Tyrion
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
subtlety
when
someone
pulled
a
hood
down
over
his
eyes
and
lifted
him
up
onto
a
saddle.

They
set
out
through
the
rain
at
a
hard
gallop,
and
before
long
Tyrion’s
thighs
were
cramped
and
aching
and
his
butt
throbbed
with
pain.
Even
when
they
were
safely
away
from
the
inn,
and
Catelyn
Stark
slowed
them
to
a
trot,
it
was
a
miserable
pounding
journey
over
rough
ground,
made
worse
by
his
blindness.
Every
twist
and
turn
put
him
in
danger
of
falling
off
his
horse.
The
hood
muffled
sound,
so
he
could
not
make
out
what
was
being
said
around
him,
and
the
rain
soaked
through
the
cloth
and
made
it
cling
to
his
face,
until
even
breathing
was
a
struggle.
The
rope
chafed
his
wrists
raw
and
seemed
to
grow
tighter
as
the
night
wore
on.
I
was
about
to
settle
down
to
a
warm
fire
and
a
roast
fowl,
and
that
wretched
singer
had
to
open
his
mouth,
he
thought
mournfully.
The
wretched
singer
had
come
along
with
them.
“There
is
a
great
song
to
be
made
from
this,
and
I’m
the
one
to
make
it,”
he
told
Catelyn
Stark
when
he
announced
his
intention
of
riding
with
them
to
see
how
the
“splendid
adventure”
turned
out.
Tyrion
wondered
whether
the
boy
would
think
the
adventure
quite
so
splendid
once
the
Lannister
riders
caught
up
with
them.

The
rain
had
finally
stopped
and
dawn
light
was
seeping
through
the
wet
cloth
over
his
eyes
when
Catelyn
Stark
gave
the
command
to
dismount.
Rough
hands
pulled
him
down
from
his
horse,
untied
his
wrists,
and
yanked
the
hood
off
his
head.
When
he
saw
the
narrow
stony
road,
the
foothills
rising
high
and
wild
all
around
them,
and
the
jagged
snowcapped
peaks
on
the
distant
horizon,
all
the
hope
went
out
of
him
in
a
rush.
“This
is
the
high
road,”
he
gasped,
looking
at
Lady
Stark
with
accusation.
“The
eastern
road.
You
said
we
were
riding
for
Winterfell!”

Catelyn
Stark
favored
him
with
the
faintest
of
smiles.
“Often
and
loudly,”
she
agreed.
“No
doubt
your
friends
will
ride
that
way
when
they
come
after
us.
I
wish
them
good
speed.”

Even
now,
long
days
later,
the
memory
filled
him
with
a
bitter
rage.
All
his
life
Tyrion
had
prided
himself
on
his
cunning,
the
only
gift
the
gods
had
seen
fit
to
give
him,
and
yet
this
seven-times-damned
she-wolf
Catelyn
Stark
had
outwitted
him
at
every
turn.
The
knowledge
was
more
galling
than
the
bare
fact
of
his
abduction.

They
stopped
only
as
long
as
it
took
to
feed
and
water
the
horses,
and
then
they
were
off
again.
This
time
Tyrion
was
spared
the
hood.
After
the
second
night
they
no
longer
bound
his
hands,
and
once
they
had
gained
the
heights
they
scarcely
bothered
to
guard
him
at
all.
It
seemed
they
did
not
fear
his
escape.
And
why
should
they?
Up
here
the
land
was
harsh
and
wild,
and
the
high
road
little
more
than
a
stony
track.
If
he
did
run,
how
far
could
he
hope
to
go,
alone
and
without
provisions?
The
shadowcats
would
make
a
morsel
of
him,
and
the
clans
that
dwelt
in
the
mountain
fastnesses
were
brigands
and
murderers
who
bowed
to
no
law
but
the
sword.

Yet
still
the
Stark
woman
drove
them
forward
relentlessly.
He
knew
where
they
were
bound.
He
had
known
it
since
the
moment
they
pulled
off
his
hood.
These
mountains
were
the
domain
of
House
Arryn,
and
the
late
Hand’s
widow
was
a
Tully,
Catelyn
Stark’s
sister…
and
no
friend
to
the
Lannisters.
Tyrion
had
known
the
Lady
Lysa
slightly
during
her
years
at
King’s
Landing,
and
did
not
look
forward
to
renewing
the
acquaintance.

His
captors
were
clustered
around
a
stream
a
short
ways
down
the
high
road.
The
horses
had
drunk
their
fill
of
the
icy
cold
water,
and
were
grazing
on
clumps
of
brown
grass
that
grew
from
clefts
in
the
rock.
Jyck
and
Morrec
huddled
close,
sullen
and
miserable.
Mohor
stood
over
them,
leaning
on
his
spear
and
wearing
a
rounded
iron
cap
that
made
him
look
as
if
he
had
a
bowl
on
his
head.
Nearby,
Marillion
the
singer
sat
oiling
his
woodharp,
complaining
of
what
the
damp
was
doing
to
his
strings.

“We
must
have
some
rest,
my
lady,”
the
hedge
knight
Ser
Willis
Wode
was
saying
to
Catelyn
Stark
as
Tyrion
approached.
He
was
Lady
Whent’s
man,
stiff-necked
and
stolid,
and
the
first
to
rise
to
aid
Catelyn
Stark
back
at
the
inn.

“Ser
Willis
speaks
truly,
my
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“This
is
the
third
horse
we
have
lost—”

“We
will
lose
more
than
horses
if
we’re
overtaken
by
the
Lannisters,”
she
reminded
them.
Her
face
was
windburnt
and
gaunt,
but
it
had
lost
none
of
its
determination.

“Small
chance
of
that
here,”
Tyrion
put
in.

“The
lady
did
not
ask
your
views,
dwarf,”
snapped
Kurleket,
a
great
fat
oaf
with
short-cropped
hair
and
a
pig’s
face.
He
was
one
of
the
Brackens,
a
man-at-arms
in
the
service
of
Lord
Jonos.
Tyrion
had
made
a
special
effort
to
learn
all
their
names,
so
he
might
thank
them
later
for
their
tender
treatment
of
him.
A
Lannister
always
paid
his
debts.
Kurleket
would
learn
that
someday,
as
would
his
friends
Lharys
and
Mohor,
and
the
good
Ser
Willis,
and
the
sellswords
Bronn
and
Chiggen.
He
planned
an
especially
sharp
lesson
for
Marillion,
him
of
the
woodharp
and
the
sweet
tenor
voice,
who
was
struggling
so
manfully
to
rhyme
imp
with
gimp
and
limp
so
he
could
make
a
song
of
this
outrage.

“Let
him
speak,”
Lady
Stark
commanded.

Tyrion
Lannister
seated
himself
on
a
rock.
“By
now
our
pursuit
is
likely
racing
across
the
Neck,
chasing
your
lie
up
the
kingsroad…
assuming
there
is
a
pursuit,
which
is
by
no
means
certain.
Oh,
no
doubt
the
word
has
reached
my
father…
but
my
father
does
not
love
me
overmuch,
and
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
he
will
bother
to
bestir
himself.”
It
was
only
half
a
lie;
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
cared
not
a
fig
for
his
deformed
son,
but
he
tolerated
no
slights
on
the
honor
of
his
House.
“This
is
a
cruel
land,
Lady
Stark.
You’ll
find
no
succor
until
you
reach
the
Vale,
and
each
mount
you
lose
burdens
the
others
all
the
more.
Worse,
you
risk
losing
me.
I
am
small,
and
not
strong,
and
if
I
die,
then
what’s
the
point?”
That
was
no
lie
at
all;
Tyrion
did
not
know
how
much
longer
he
could
endure
this
pace.

“It
might
be
said
that
your
death
is
the
point,
Lannister,”
Catelyn
Stark
replied.

“I
think
not,”
Tyrion
said.
“If
you
wanted
me
dead,
you
had
only
to
say
the
word,
and
one
of
these
staunch
friends
of
yours
would
gladly
have
given
me
a
red
smile.”
He
looked
at
Kurleket,
but
the
man
was
too
dim
to
taste
the
mockery.

“The
Starks
do
not
murder
men
in
their
beds.”

“Nor
do
I,”
he
said.
“I
tell
you
again,
I
had
no
part
in
the
attempt
to
kill
your
son.”

“The
assassin
was
armed
with
your
dagger.”

Tyrion
felt
the
heat
rise
in
him.
“It
was
not
my
dagger,”
he
insisted.
“How
many
times
must
I
swear
to
that?
Lady
Stark,
whatever
you
may
believe
of
me,
I
am
not
a
stupid
man.
Only
a
fool
would
arm
a
common
footpad
with
his
own
blade.”

Just
for
a
moment,
he
thought
he
saw
a
flicker
of
doubt
in
her
eyes,
but
what
she
said
was,
“Why
would
Petyr
lie
to
me?”

“Why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods?”
he
demanded.
“Because
it
is
his
nature.
Lying
comes
as
easily
as
breathing
to
a
man
like
Littlefinger.
You
ought
to
know
that,
you
of
all
people.”

She
took
a
step
toward
him,
her
face
tight.
“And
what
does
that
mean,
Lannister?”

Tyrion
cocked
his
head.
“Why,
every
man
at
court
has
heard
him
tell
how
he
took
your
maidenhead,
my
lady.”

“That
is
a
lie!”
Catelyn
Stark
said.

“Oh,
wicked
little
imp,”
Marillion
said,
shocked.

Kurleket
drew
his
dirk,
a
vicious
piece
of
black
iron.
“At
your
word,
m’lady,
I’ll
toss
his
lying
tongue
at
your
feet.”
His
pig
eyes
were
wet
with
excitement
at
the
prospect.

Catelyn
Stark
stared
at
Tyrion
with
a
coldness
on
her
face
such
as
he
had
never
seen.
“Petyr
Baelish
loved
me
once.
He
was
only
a
boy.
His
passion
was
a
tragedy
for
all
of
us,
but
it
was
real,
and
pure,
and
nothing
to
be
made
mock
of.
He
wanted
my
hand.
That
is
the
truth
of
the
matter.
You
are
truly
an
evil
man,
Lannister.”

“And
you
are
truly
a
fool,
Lady
Stark.
Littlefinger
has
never
loved
anyone
but
Littlefinger,
and
I
promise
you
that
it
is
not
your
hand
that
he
boasts
of,
it’s
those
ripe
breasts
of
yours,
and
that
sweet
mouth,
and
the
heat
between
your
legs.”

Kurleket
grabbed
a
handful
of
hair
and
yanked
his
head
back
in
a
hard
jerk,
baring
his
throat.
Tyrion
felt
the
cold
kiss
of
steel
beneath
his
chin.
“Shall
I
bleed
him,
my
lady?”

“Kill
me
and
the
truth
dies
with
me,”
Tyrion
gasped.

“Let
him
talk,”
Catelyn
Stark
commanded.

Kurleket
let
go
of
Tyrion’s
hair,
reluctantly.

Tyrion
took
a
deep
breath.
“How
did
Littlefinger
tell
you
I
came
by
this
dagger
of
his?
Answer
me
that.”

“You
won
it
from
him
in
a
wager,
during
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day.”

“When
my
brother
Jaime
was
unhorsed
by
the
Knight
of
Flowers,
that
was
his
story,
no?”

“It
was,”
she
admitted.
A
line
creased
her
brow.

“Riders!”

The
shriek
came
from
the
wind-carved
ridge
above
them.
Ser
Rodrik
had
sent
Lharys
scrambling
up
the
rock
face
to
watch
the
road
while
they
took
their
rest.

For
a
long
second,
no
one
moved.
Catelyn
Stark
was
the
first
to
react.
“Ser
Rodrik,
Ser
Willis,
to
horse,”
she
shouted.
“Get
the
other
mounts
behind
us.
Mohor,
guard
the
prisoners—”

“Arm
us!”
Tyrion
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
her
by
the
arm.
“You
will
need
every
sword.”

She
knew
he
was
right,
Tyrion
could
see
it.
The
mountain
clans
cared
nothing
for
the
enmities
of
the
great
houses;
they
would
slaughter
Stark
and
Lannister
with
equal
fervor,
as
they
slaughtered
each
other.
They
might
spare
Catelyn
herself;
she
was
still
young
enough
to
bear
sons.
Still,
she
hesitated.

“I
hear
them!”
Ser
Rodrik
called
out.
Tyrion
turned
his
head
to
listen,
and
there
it
was:
hoofbeats,
a
dozen
horses
or
more,
coming
nearer.
Suddenly
everyone
was
moving,
reaching
for
weapons,
running
to
their
mounts.

Pebbles
rained
down
around
them
as
Lharys
came
springing
and
sliding
down
the
ridge.
He
landed
breathless
in
front
of
Catelyn
Stark,
an
ungainly-looking
man
with
wild
tufts
of
rust-colored
hair
sticking
out
from
under
a
conical
steel
cap.
“Twenty
men,
maybe
twenty-five,”
he
said,
breathless.
“Milk
Snakes
or
Moon
Brothers,
by
my
guess.
They
must
have
eyes
out,
m’lady…
hidden
watchers…
they
know
we’re
here.”

Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
was
already
ahorse,
a
longsword
in
hand.
Mohor
crouched
behind
a
boulder,
both
hands
on
his
iron-tipped
spear,
a
dagger
between
his
teeth.
“You,
singer,”
Ser
Willis
Wode
called
out.
“Help
me
with
this
breastplate.”
Marillion
sat
frozen,
clutching
his
woodharp,
his
face
as
pale
as
milk,
but
Tyrion’s
man
Morrec
bounded
quickly
to
his
feet
and
moved
to
help
the
knight
with
his
armor.

Tyrion
kept
his
grip
on
Catelyn
Stark.
“You
have
no
choice,”
he
told
her.
“Three
of
us,
and
a
fourth
man
wasted
guarding
us…
four
men
can
be
the
difference
between
life
and
death
up
here.”

“Give
me
your
word
that
you
will
put
down
your
swords
again
after
the
fight
is
done.”

“My
word?”
The
hoofbeats
were
louder
now.
Tyrion
grinned
crookedly.
“Oh,
that
you
have,
my
lady…
on
my
honor
as
a
Lannister.”

For
a
moment
he
thought
she
would
spit
at
him,
but
instead
she
snapped,
“Arm
them,”
and
as
quick
as
that
she
was
pulling
away.
Ser
Rodrik
tossed
Jyck
his
sword
and
scabbard,
and
wheeled
to
meet
the
foe.
Morrec
helped
himself
to
a
bow
and
quiver,
and
went
to
one
knee
beside
the
road.
He
was
a
better
archer
than
swordsman.
And
Bronn
rode
up
to
offer
Tyrion
a
double-bladed
axe.

“I
have
never
fought
with
an
axe.”
The
weapon
felt
awkward
and
unfamiliar
in
his
hands.
It
had
a
short
haft,
a
heavy
head,
a
nasty
spike
on
top.

“Pretend
you’re
splitting
logs,”
Bronn
said,
drawing
his
longsword
from
the
scabbard
across
his
back.
He
spat,
and
trotted
off
to
form
up
beside
Chiggen
and
Ser
Rodrik.
Ser
Willis
mounted
up
to
join
them,
fumbling
with
his
helmet,
a
metal
pot
with
a
thin
slit
for
his
eyes
and
a
long
black
silk
plume.

“Logs
don’t
bleed,”
Tyrion
said
to
no
one
in
particular.
He
felt
naked
without
armor.
He
looked
around
for
a
rock
and
ran
over
to
where
Marillion
was
hiding.
“Move
over.”

“Go
away!”
the
boy
screamed
back
at
him.
“I’m
a
singer,
I
want
no
part
of
this
fight!”

“What,
lost
your
taste
for
adventure?”
Tyrion
kicked
at
the
youth
until
he
slid
over,
and
not
a
moment
too
soon.
A
heartbeat
later,
the
riders
were
on
them.

There
were
no
heralds,
no
banners,
no
horns
nor
drums,
only
the
twang
of
bowstrings
as
Morrec
and
Lharys
let
fly,
and
suddenly
the
clansmen
came
thundering
out
of
the
dawn,
lean
dark
men
in
boiled
leather
and
mismatched
armor,
faces
hidden
behind
barred
halfhelms.
In
gloved
hands
were
clutched
all
manner
of
weapons:
longswords
and
lances
and
sharpened
scythes,
spiked
clubs
and
daggers
and
heavy
iron
mauls.
At
their
head
rode
a
big
man
in
a
striped
shadowskin
cloak,
armed
with
a
two-handed
greatsword.

Ser
Rodrik
shouted
“Winterfell!”
and
rode
to
meet
him,
with
Bronn
and
Chiggen
beside
him,
screaming
some
wordless
battle
cry.
Ser
Willis
Wode
followed,
swinging
a
spiked
morningstar
around
his
head.
“Harrenhal!
Harrenhal!”
he
sang.
Tyrion
felt
a
sudden
urge
to
leap
up,
brandish
his
axe,
and
boom
out,
“Casterly
Rock!”
but
the
insanity
passed
quickly
and
he
crouched
down
lower.

He
heard
the
screams
of
frightened
horses
and
the
crash
of
metal
on
metal.
Chiggen’s
sword
raked
across
the
naked
face
of
a
mailed
rider,
and
Bronn
plunged
through
the
clansmen
like
a
whirlwind,
cutting
down
foes
right
and
left.
Ser
Rodrik
hammered
at
the
big
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak,
their
horses
dancing
round
each
other
as
they
traded
blow
for
blow.
Jyck
vaulted
onto
a
horse
and
galloped
bareback
into
the
fray.
Tyrion
saw
an
arrow
sprout
from
the
throat
of
the
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak.
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
only
blood
came
out.
By
the
time
he
fell,
Ser
Rodrik
was
fighting
someone
else.

Suddenly
Marillion
shrieked,
covering
his
head
with
his
woodharp
as
a
horse
leapt
over
their
rock.
Tyrion
scrambled
to
his
feet
as
the
rider
turned
to
come
back
at
them,
hefting
a
spiked
maul.
Tyrion
swung
his
axe
with
both
hands.
The
blade
caught
the
charging
horse
in
the
throat
with
a
meaty
thunk,
angling
upward,
and
Tyrion
almost
lost
his
grip
as
the
animal
screamed
and
collapsed.
He
managed
to
wrench
the
axe
free
and
lurch
clumsily
out
of
the
way.
Marillion
was
less
fortunate.
Horse
and
rider
crashed
to
the
ground
in
a
tangle
on
top
of
the
singer.
Tyrion
danced
back
in
while
the
brigand’s
leg
was
still
pinned
beneath
his
fallen
mount,
and
buried
the
axe
in
the
man’s
neck,
just
above
the
shoulder
blades.

As
he
struggled
to
yank
the
blade
loose,
he
heard
Marillion
moaning
under
the
bodies.
“Someone
help
me,”
the
singer
gasped.
“Gods
have
mercy,
I’m
bleeding.”

“I
believe
that’s
horse
blood,”
Tyrion
said.
The
singer’s
hand
came
crawling
out
from
beneath
the
dead
animal,
scrabbling
in
the
dirt
like
a
spider
with
five
legs.
Tyrion
put
his
heel
on
the
grasping
fingers
and
felt
a
satisfying
crunch.
“Close
your
eyes
and
pretend
you’re
dead,”
he
advised
the
singer
before
he
hefted
the
axe
and
turned
away.

After
that,
things
ran
together.
The
dawn
was
full
of
shouts
and
screams
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
blood,
and
the
world
had
turned
to
chaos.
Arrows
hissed
past
his
ear
and
clattered
off
the
rocks.
He
saw
Bronn
unhorsed,
fighting
with
a
sword
in
each
hand.
Tyrion
kept
on
the
fringes
of
the
fight,
sliding
from
rock
to
rock
and
darting
out
of
the
shadows
to
hew
at
the
legs
of
passing
horses.
He
found
a
wounded
clansman
and
left
him
dead,
helping
himself
to
the
man’s
halfhelm.
It
fit
too
snugly,
but
Tyrion
was
glad
of
any
protection
at
all.
Jyck
was
cut
down
from
behind
while
he
sliced
at
a
man
in
front
of
him,
and
later
Tyrion
stumbled
over
Kurleket’s
body.
The
pig
face
had
been
smashed
in
with
a
mace,
but
Tyrion
recognized
the
dirk
as
he
plucked
it
from
the
man’s
dead
fingers.
He
was
sliding
it
through
his
belt
when
he
heard
a
woman’s
scream.

Catelyn
Stark
was
trapped
against
the
stone
face
of
the
mountain
with
three
men
around
her,
one
still
mounted
and
the
other
two
on
foot.
She
had
a
dagger
clutched
awkwardly
in
her
maimed
hands,
but
her
back
was
to
the
rock
now
and
they
had
penned
her
on
three
sides.
Let
them
have
the
bitch,
Tyrion
thought,
and
welcome
to
her,
yet
somehow
he
was
moving.
He
caught
the
first
man
in
the
back
of
the
knee
before
they
even
knew
he
was
there,
and
the
heavy
axehead
split
flesh
and
bone
like
rotten
wood.
Logs
that
bleed,
Tyrion
thought
inanely
as
the
second
man
came
for
him.
Tyrion
ducked
under
his
sword,
lashed
out
with
the
axe,
the
man
reeled
backward…
and
Catelyn
Stark
stepped
up
behind
him
and
opened
his
throat.
The
horseman
remembered
an
urgent
engagement
elsewhere
and
galloped
off
suddenly.

Tyrion
looked
around.
The
enemy
were
all
vanquished
or
vanished.
Somehow
the
fighting
had
ended
when
he
wasn’t
looking.
Dying
horses
and
wounded
men
lay
all
around,
screaming
or
moaning.
To
his
vast
astonishment,
he
was
not
one
of
them.
He
opened
his
fingers
and
let
the
axe
thunk
to
the
ground.
His
hands
were
sticky
with
blood.
He
could
have
sworn
they
had
been
fighting
for
half
a
day,
but
the
sun
seemed
scarcely
to
have
moved
at
all.

“Your
first
battle?”
Bronn
asked
later
as
he
bent
over
Jyck’s
body,
pulling
off
his
boots.
They
were
good
boots,
as
befit
one
of
Lord
Tywin’s
men;
heavy
leather,
oiled
and
supple,
much
finer
than
what
Bronn
was
wearing.

Tyrion
nodded.
“My
father
will
be
so
proud,”
he
said.
His
legs
were
cramping
so
badly
he
could
scarcely
stand.
Odd,
he
had
never
once
noticed
the
pain
during
the
battle.

“You
need
a
woman
now,”
Bronn
said
with
a
glint
in
his
black
eyes.
He
shoved
the
boots
into
his
saddlebag.
“Nothing
like
a
woman
after
a
man’s
been
blooded,
take
my
word.”

Chiggen
stopped
looting
the
corpses
of
the
brigands
long
enough
to
snort
and
lick
his
lips.

Tyrion
glanced
over
to
where
Lady
Stark
was
dressing
Ser
Rodrik’s
wounds.
“I’m
willing
if
she
is,”
he
said.
The
freeriders
broke
into
laughter,
and
Tyrion
grinned
and
thought,
There’s
a
start.

Afterward
he
knelt
by
the
stream
and
washed
the
blood
off
his
face
in
water
cold
as
ice.
As
he
limped
back
to
the
others,
he
glanced
again
at
the
slain.
The
dead
clansmen
were
thin,
ragged
men,
their
horses
scrawny
and
undersized,
with
every
rib
showing.
What
weapons
Bronn
and
Chiggen
had
left
them
were
none
too
impressive.
Mauls,
clubs,
a
scythe…
He
remembered
the
big
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak
who
had
dueled
Ser
Rodrik
with
a
two-handed
greatsword,
but
when
he
found
his
corpse
sprawled
on
the
stony
ground,
the
man
was
not
so
big
after
all,
the
cloak
was
gone,
and
Tyrion
saw
that
the
blade
was
badly
notched,
its
cheap
steel
spotted
with
rust.
Small
wonder
the
clansmen
had
left
nine
bodies
on
the
ground.

They
had
only
three
dead;
two
of
Lord
Bracken’s
men-at-arms,
Kurleket
and
Mohor,
and
his
own
man
Jyck,
who
had
made
such
a
bold
show
with
his
bareback
charge.
A
fool
to
the
end,
Tyrion
thought.

“Lady
Stark,
I
urge
you
to
press
on,
with
all
haste,”
Ser
Willis
Wode
said,
his
eyes
scanning
the
ridgetops
warily
through
the
slit
in
his
helm.
“We
drove
them
off
for
the
moment,
but
they
will
not
have
gone
far.”

“We
must
bury
our
dead,
Ser
Willis,”
she
said.
“These
were
brave
men.
I
will
not
leave
them
to
the
crows
and
shadowcats.”

“This
soil
is
too
stony
for
digging,”
Ser
Willis
said.

“Then
we
shall
gather
stones
for
cairns.”

“Gather
all
the
stones
you
want,”
Bronn
told
her,
“but
do
it
without
me
or
Chiggen.
I’ve
better
things
to
do
than
pile
rocks
on
dead
men…
breathing,
for
one.”
He
looked
over
the
rest
of
the
survivors.
“Any
of
you
who
hope
to
be
alive
come
nightfall,
ride
with
us.”

“My
lady,
I
fear
he
speaks
the
truth,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
wearily.
The
old
knight
had
been
wounded
in
the
fight,
a
deep
gash
in
his
left
arm
and
a
spear
thrust
that
grazed
his
neck,
and
he
sounded
his
age.
“If
we
linger
here,
they
will
be
on
us
again
for
a
certainty,
and
we
may
not
live
through
a
second
attack.”

Tyrion
could
see
the
anger
in
Catelyn’s
face,
but
she
had
no
choice.
“May
the
gods
forgive
us,
then.
We
will
ride
at
once.”

There
was
no
shortage
of
horses
now.
Tyrion
moved
his
saddle
to
Jyck’s
spotted
gelding,
who
looked
strong
enough
to
last
another
three
or
four
days
at
least.
He
was
about
to
mount
when
Lharys
stepped
up
and
said,
“I’ll
take
that
dirk
now,
dwarf.”

“Let
him
keep
it.”
Catelyn
Stark
looked
down
from
her
horse.
“And
see
that
he
has
his
axe
back
as
well.
We
may
have
need
of
it
if
we
are
attacked
again.”

“You
have
my
thanks,
lady,”
Tyrion
said,
mounting
up.

“Save
them,”
she
said
curtly.
“I
trust
you
no
more
than
I
did
before.”
She
was
gone
before
he
could
frame
a
reply.

Tyrion
adjusted
his
stolen
helm
and
took
the
axe
from
Bronn.
He
remembered
how
he
had
begun
the
journey,
with
his
wrists
bound
and
a
hood
pulled
down
over
his
head,
and
decided
that
this
was
a
definite
improvement.
Lady
Stark
could
keep
her
trust;
so
long
as
he
could
keep
the
axe,
he
would
count
himself
ahead
in
the
game.

Ser
Willis
Wode
led
them
out.
Bronn
took
the
rear,
with
Lady
Stark
safely
in
the
middle,
Ser
Rodrik
a
shadow
beside
her.
Marillion
kept
throwing
sullen
looks
back
at
Tyrion
as
they
rode.
The
singer
had
broken
several
ribs,
his
woodharp,
and
all
four
fingers
on
his
playing
hand,
yet
the
day
had
not
been
an
utter
loss
to
him;
somewhere
he
had
acquired
a
magnificent
shadowskin
cloak,
thick
black
fur
slashed
by
stripes
of
white.
He
huddled
beneath
its
folds
silently,
and
for
once
had
nothing
to
say.

They
heard
the
deep
growls
of
shadowcats
behind
them
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile,
and
later
the
wild
snarling
of
the
beasts
fighting
over
the
corpses
they
had
left
behind.
Marillion
grew
visibly
pale.
Tyrion
trotted
up
beside
him.
“Craven,”
he
said,
“rhymes
nicely
with
raven.”
He
kicked
his
horse
and
moved
past
the
singer,
up
to
Ser
Rodrik
and
Catelyn
Stark.

She
looked
at
him,
lips
pressed
tightly
together.

“As
I
was
saying
before
we
were
so
rudely
interrupted,”
Tyrion
began,
“there
is
a
serious
flaw
in
Littlefinger’s
fable.
Whatever
you
may
believe
of
me,
Lady
Stark,
I
promise
you
this—I
never
bet
against
my
family.”





ARYA

The
one-eared
black
tom
arched
his
back
and
hissed
at
her.

Arya
padded
down
the
alley,
balanced
lightly
on
the
balls
of
her
bare
feet,
listening
to
the
flutter
of
her
heart,
breathing
slow
deep
breaths.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself,
light
as
a
feather.
The
tomcat
watched
her
come,
his
eyes
wary.

Catching
cats
was
hard.
Her
hands
were
covered
with
half-healed
scratches,
and
both
knees
were
scabbed
over
where
she
had
scraped
them
raw
in
tumbles.
At
first
even
the
cook’s
huge
fat
kitchen
cat
had
been
able
to
elude
her,
but
Syrio
had
kept
her
at
it
day
and
night.
When
she’d
run
to
him
with
her
hands
bleeding,
he
had
said,
“So
slow?
Be
quicker,
girl.
Your
enemies
will
give
you
more
than
scratches.”
He
had
dabbed
her
wounds
with
Myrish
fire,
which
burned
so
bad
she
had
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
keep
from
screaming.
Then
he
sent
her
out
after
more
cats.

The
Red
Keep
was
full
of
cats:
lazy
old
cats
dozing
in
the
sun,
cold-eyed
mousers
twitching
their
tails,
quick
little
kittens
with
claws
like
needles,
ladies’
cats
all
combed
and
trusting,
ragged
shadows
prowling
the
midden
heaps.
One
by
one
Arya
had
chased
them
down
and
snatched
them
up
and
brought
them
proudly
to
Syrio
Forel…
all
but
this
one,
this
one-eared
black
devil
of
a
tomcat.
“That’s
the
real
king
of
this
castle
right
there,”
one
of
the
gold
cloaks
had
told
her.
“Older
than
sin
and
twice
as
mean.
One
time,
the
king
was
feasting
the
queen’s
father,
and
that
black
bastard
hopped
up
on
the
table
and
snatched
a
roast
quail
right
out
of
Lord
Tywin’s
fingers.
Robert
laughed
so
hard
he
like
to
burst.
You
stay
away
from
that
one,
child.”

He
had
run
her
halfway
across
the
castle;
twice
around
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
across
the
inner
bailey,
through
the
stables,
down
the
serpentine
steps,
past
the
small
kitchen
and
the
pig
yard
and
the
barracks
of
the
gold
cloaks,
along
the
base
of
the
river
wall
and
up
more
steps
and
back
and
forth
over
Traitor’s
Walk,
and
then
down
again
and
through
a
gate
and
around
a
well
and
in
and
out
of
strange
buildings
until
Arya
didn’t
know
where
she
was.

Now
at
last
she
had
him.
High
walls
pressed
close
on
either
side,
and
ahead
was
a
blank
windowless
mass
of
stone.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
repeated,
sliding
forward,
light
as
a
feather.

When
she
was
three
steps
away
from
him,
the
tomcat
bolted.
Left,
then
right,
he
went;
and
right,
then
left,
went
Arya,
cutting
off
his
escape.
He
hissed
again
and
tried
to
dart
between
her
legs.
Quick
as
a
snake,
she
thought.
Her
hands
closed
around
him.
She
hugged
him
to
her
chest,
whirling
and
laughing
aloud
as
his
claws
raked
at
the
front
of
her
leather
jerkin.
Ever
so
fast,
she
kissed
him
right
between
the
eyes,
and
jerked
her
head
back
an
instant
before
his
claws
would
have
found
her
face.
The
tomcat
yowled
and
spit.

“What’s
he
doing
to
that
cat?”

Startled,
Arya
dropped
the
cat
and
whirled
toward
the
voice.
The
tom
bounded
off
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
At
the
end
of
the
alley
stood
a
girl
with
a
mass
of
golden
curls,
dressed
as
pretty
as
a
doll
in
blue
satin.
Beside
her
was
a
plump
little
blond
boy
with
a
prancing
stag
sewn
in
pearls
across
the
front
of
his
doublet
and
a
miniature
sword
at
his
belt.
Princess
Myrcella
and
Prince
Tommen,
Arya
thought.
A
septa
as
large
as
a
draft
horse
hovered
over
them,
and
behind
her
two
big
men
in
crimson
cloaks,
Lannister
house
guards.

“What
were
you
doing
to
that
cat,
boy?”
Myrcella
asked
again,
sternly.
To
her
brother
she
said,
“He’s
a
ragged
boy,
isn’t
he?
Look
at
him.”
She
giggled.

“A
ragged
dirty
smelly
boy,”
Tommen
agreed.

They
don’t
know
me,
Arya
realized.
They
don’t
even
know
I’m
a
girl.
Small
wonder;
she
was
barefoot
and
dirty,
her
hair
tangled
from
the
long
run
through
the
castle,
clad
in
a
jerkin
ripped
by
cat
claws
and
brown
roughspun
pants
hacked
off
above
her
scabby
knees.
You
don’t
wear
skirts
and
silks
when
you’re
catching
cats.
Quickly
she
lowered
her
head
and
dropped
to
one
knee.
Maybe
they
wouldn’t
recognize
her.
If
they
did,
she
would
never
hear
the
end
of
it.
Septa
Mordane
would
be
mortified,
and
Sansa
would
never
speak
to
her
again
from
the
shame.

The
old
fat
septa
moved
forward.
“Boy,
how
did
you
come
here?
You
have
no
business
in
this
part
of
the
castle.”

“You
can’t
keep
this
sort
out,”
one
of
the
red
cloaks
said.
“Like
trying
to
keep
out
rats.”

“Who
do
you
belong
to,
boy?”
the
septa
demanded.
“Answer
me.
What’s
wrong
with
you,
are
you
mute?”

Arya’s
voice
caught
in
her
throat.
If
she
answered,
Tommen
and
Myrcella
would
know
her
for
certain.

“Godwyn,
bring
him
here,”
the
septa
said.
The
taller
of
the
guardsmen
started
down
the
alley.

Panic
gripped
her
throat
like
a
giant’s
hand.
Arya
could
not
have
spoken
if
her
life
had
hung
on
it.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
mouthed
silently.

As
Godwyn
reached
for
her,
Arya
moved.
Quick
as
a
snake.
She
leaned
to
her
left,
letting
his
fingers
brush
her
arm,
spinning
around
him.
Smooth
as
summer
silk.
By
the
time
he
got
himself
turned,
she
was
sprinting
down
the
alley.
Swift
as
a
deer.
The
septa
was
screeching
at
her.
Arya
slid
between
legs
as
thick
and
white
as
marble
columns,
bounded
to
her
feet,
bowled
into
Prince
Tommen
and
hopped
over
him
when
he
sat
down
hard
and
said
“Oof,”
spun
away
from
the
second
guard,
and
then
she
was
past
them
all,
running
full
out.

She
heard
shouts,
then
pounding
footsteps,
closing
behind
her.
She
dropped
and
rolled.
The
red
cloak
went
careening
past
her,
stumbling.
Arya
sprang
back
to
her
feet.
She
saw
a
window
above
her,
high
and
narrow,
scarcely
more
than
an
arrow
slit.
Arya
leapt,
caught
the
sill,
pulled
herself
up.
She
held
her
breath
as
she
wriggled
through.
Slippery
as
an
eel.
Dropping
to
the
floor
in
front
of
a
startled
scrubwoman,
she
hopped
up,
brushed
the
rushes
off
her
clothes,
and
was
off
again,
out
the
door
and
along
a
long
hall,
down
a
stair,
across
a
hidden
courtyard,
around
a
corner
and
over
a
wall
and
through
a
low
narrow
window
into
a
pitch-dark
cellar.
The
sounds
grew
more
and
more
distant
behind
her.

Arya
was
out
of
breath
and
quite
thoroughly
lost.
She
was
in
for
it
now
if
they
had
recognized
her,
but
she
didn’t
think
they
had.
She’d
moved
too
fast.
Swift
as
a
deer.

She
hunkered
down
in
the
dark
against
a
damp
stone
wall
and
listened
for
the
pursuit,
but
the
only
sound
was
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
and
a
distant
drip
of
water.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself.
She
wondered
where
she
was.
When
they
had
first
come
to
King’s
Landing,
she
used
to
have
bad
dreams
about
getting
lost
in
the
castle.
Father
said
the
Red
Keep
was
smaller
than
Winterfell,
but
in
her
dreams
it
had
been
immense,
an
endless
stone
maze
with
walls
that
seemed
to
shift
and
change
behind
her.
She
would
find
herself
wandering
down
gloomy
halls
past
faded
tapestries,
descending
endless
circular
stairs,
darting
through
courtyards
or
over
bridges,
her
shouts
echoing
unanswered.
In
some
of
the
rooms
the
red
stone
walls
would
seem
to
drip
blood,
and
nowhere
could
she
find
a
window.
Sometimes
she
would
hear
her
father’s
voice,
but
always
from
a
long
way
off,
and
no
matter
how
hard
she
ran
after
it,
it
would
grow
fainter
and
fainter,
until
it
faded
to
nothing
and
Arya
was
alone
in
the
dark.

It
was
very
dark
right
now,
she
realized.
She
hugged
her
bare
knees
tight
against
her
chest
and
shivered.
She
would
wait
quietly
and
count
to
ten
thousand.
By
then
it
would
be
safe
for
her
to
come
creeping
back
out
and
find
her
way
home.

By
the
time
she
had
reached
eighty-seven,
the
room
had
begun
to
lighten
as
her
eyes
adjusted
to
the
blackness.
Slowly
the
shapes
around
her
took
on
form.
Huge
empty
eyes
stared
at
her
hungrily
through
the
gloom,
and
dimly
she
saw
the
jagged
shadows
of
long
teeth.
She
had
lost
the
count.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
bit
her
lip
and
sent
the
fear
away.
When
she
looked
again,
the
monsters
would
be
gone.
Would
never
have
been.
She
pretended
that
Syrio
was
beside
her
in
the
dark,
whispering
in
her
ear.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
told
herself.
Strong
as
a
bear.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine.
She
opened
her
eyes
again.

The
monsters
were
still
there,
but
the
fear
was
gone.

Arya
got
to
her
feet,
moving
warily.
The
heads
were
all
around
her.
She
touched
one,
curious,
wondering
if
it
was
real.
Her
fingertips
brushed
a
massive
jaw.
It
felt
real
enough.
The
bone
was
smooth
beneath
her
hand,
cold
and
hard
to
the
touch.
She
ran
her
fingers
down
a
tooth,
black
and
sharp,
a
dagger
made
of
darkness.
It
made
her
shiver.

“It’s
dead,”
she
said
aloud.
“It’s
just
a
skull,
it
can’t
hurt
me.”
Yet
somehow
the
monster
seemed
to
know
she
was
there.
She
could
feel
its
empty
eyes
watching
her
through
the
gloom,
and
there
was
something
in
that
dim,
cavernous
room
that
did
not
love
her.
She
edged
away
from
the
skull
and
backed
into
a
second,
larger
than
the
first.
For
an
instant
she
could
feel
its
teeth
digging
into
her
shoulder,
as
if
it
wanted
a
bite
of
her
flesh.
Arya
whirled,
felt
leather
catch
and
tear
as
a
huge
fang
nipped
at
her
jerkin,
and
then
she
was
running.
Another
skull
loomed
ahead,
the
biggest
monster
of
all,
but
Arya
did
not
even
slow.
She
leapt
over
a
ridge
of
black
teeth
as
tall
as
swords,
dashed
through
hungry
jaws,
and
threw
herself
against
the
door.

Her
hands
found
a
heavy
iron
ring
set
in
the
wood,
and
she
yanked
at
it.
The
door
resisted
a
moment,
before
it
slowly
began
to
swing
inward,
with
a
creak
so
loud
Arya
was
certain
it
could
be
heard
all
through
the
city.
She
opened
the
door
just
far
enough
to
slip
through,
into
the
hallway
beyond.

If
the
room
with
the
monsters
had
been
dark,
the
hall
was
the
blackest
pit
in
the
seven
hells.
Calm
as
still
water,
Arya
told
herself,
but
even
when
she
gave
her
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust,
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
vague
grey
outline
of
the
door
she
had
come
through.
She
wiggled
her
fingers
in
front
of
her
face,
felt
the
air
move,
saw
nothing.
She
was
blind.
A
water
dancer
sees
with
all
her
senses,
she
reminded
herself.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
steadied
her
breathing
one
two
three,
drank
in
the
quiet,
reached
out
with
her
hands.

Her
fingers
brushed
against
rough
unfinished
stone
to
her
left.
She
followed
the
wall,
her
hand
skimming
along
the
surface,
taking
small
gliding
steps
through
the
darkness.
All
halls
lead
somewhere.
Where
there
is
a
way
in,
there
is
a
way
out.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Arya
would
not
be
afraid.
It
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
walking
a
long
ways
when
the
wall
ended
abruptly
and
a
draft
of
cold
air
blew
past
her
cheek.
Loose
hairs
stirred
faintly
against
her
skin.

From
somewhere
far
below
her,
she
heard
noises.
The
scrape
of
boots,
the
distant
sound
of
voices.
A
flickering
light
brushed
the
wall
ever
so
faintly,
and
she
saw
that
she
stood
at
the
top
of
a
great
black
well,
a
shaft
twenty
feet
across
plunging
deep
into
the
earth.
Huge
stones
had
been
set
into
the
curving
walls
as
steps,
circling
down
and
down,
dark
as
the
steps
to
hell
that
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
them
of.
And
something
was
coming
up
out
of
the
darkness,
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth…

Arya
peered
over
the
edge
and
felt
the
cold
black
breath
on
her
face.
Far
below,
she
saw
the
light
of
a
single
torch,
small
as
the
flame
of
a
candle.
Two
men,
she
made
out.
Their
shadows
writhed
against
the
sides
of
the
well,
tall
as
giants.
She
could
hear
their
voices,
echoing
up
the
shaft.

“…found
one
bastard,”
one
said.
“The
rest
will
come
soon.
A
day,
two
days,
a
fortnight…”

“And
when
he
learns
the
truth,
what
will
he
do?”
a
second
voice
asked
in
the
liquid
accents
of
the
Free
Cities.

“The
gods
alone
know,”
the
first
voice
said.
Arya
could
see
a
wisp
of
grey
smoke
drifting
up
off
the
torch,
writhing
like
a
snake
as
it
rose.
“The
fools
tried
to
kill
his
son,
and
what’s
worse,
they
made
a
mummer’s
farce
of
it.
He’s
not
a
man
to
put
that
aside.
I
warn
you,
the
wolf
and
lion
will
soon
be
at
each
other’s
throats,
whether
we
will
it
or
no.”

“Too
soon,
too
soon,”
the
voice
with
the
accent
complained.
“What
good
is
war
now?
We
are
not
ready.
Delay.”

“As
well
bid
me
stop
time.
Do
you
take
me
for
a
wizard?”

The
other
chuckled.
“No
less.”
Flames
licked
at
the
cold
air.
The
tall
shadows
were
almost
on
top
of
her.
An
instant
later
the
man
holding
the
torch
climbed
into
her
sight,
his
companion
beside
him.
Arya
crept
back
away
from
the
well,
dropped
to
her
stomach,
and
flattened
herself
against
the
wall.
She
held
her
breath
as
the
men
reached
the
top
of
the
steps.

“What
would
you
have
me
do?”
asked
the
torchbearer,
a
stout
man
in
a
leather
half
cape.
Even
in
heavy
boots,
his
feet
seemed
to
glide
soundlessly
over
the
ground.
A
round
scarred
face
and
a
stubble
of
dark
beard
showed
under
his
steel
cap,
and
he
wore
mail
over
boiled
leather,
and
a
dirk
and
shortsword
at
his
belt.
It
seemed
to
Arya
there
was
something
oddly
familiar
about
him.

“If
one
Hand
can
die,
why
not
a
second?”
replied
the
man
with
the
accent
and
the
forked
yellow
beard.
“You
have
danced
the
dance
before,
my
friend.”
He
was
no
one
Arya
had
ever
seen
before,
she
was
certain
of
it.
Grossly
fat,
yet
he
seemed
to
walk
lightly,
carrying
his
weight
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
as
a
water
dancer
might.
His
rings
glimmered
in
the
torchlight,
red-gold
and
pale
silver,
crusted
with
rubies,
sapphires,
slitted
yellow
tiger
eyes.
Every
finger
wore
a
ring;
some
had
two.

“Before
is
not
now,
and
this
Hand
is
not
the
other,”
the
scarred
man
said
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
Still
as
stone,
Arya
told
herself,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Blinded
by
the
blaze
of
their
own
torch,
they
did
not
see
her
pressed
flat
against
the
stone,
only
a
few
feet
away.

“Perhaps
so,”
the
forked
beard
replied,
pausing
to
catch
his
breath
after
the
long
climb.
“Nonetheless,
we
must
have
time.
The
princess
is
with
child.
The
khal
will
not
bestir
himself
until
his
son
is
born.
You
know
how
they
are,
these
savages.”

The
man
with
the
torch
pushed
at
something.
Arya
heard
a
deep
rumbling.
A
huge
slab
of
rock,
red
in
the
torchlight,
slid
down
out
of
the
ceiling
with
a
resounding
crash
that
almost
made
her
cry
out.
Where
the
entry
to
the
well
had
been
was
nothing
but
stone,
solid
and
unbroken.

“If
he
does
not
bestir
himself
soon,
it
may
be
too
late,”
the
stout
man
in
the
steel
cap
said.
“This
is
no
longer
a
game
for
two
players,
if
ever
it
was.
Stannis
Baratheon
and
Lysa
Arryn
have
fled
beyond
my
reach,
and
the
whispers
say
they
are
gathering
swords
around
them.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
writes
Highgarden,
urging
his
lord
father
to
send
his
sister
to
court.
The
girl
is
a
maid
of
fourteen,
sweet
and
beautiful
and
tractable,
and
Lord
Renly
and
Ser
Loras
intend
that
Robert
should
bed
her,
wed
her,
and
make
a
new
queen.
Littlefinger…
the
gods
only
know
what
game
Littlefinger
is
playing.
Yet
Lord
Stark’s
the
one
who
troubles
my
sleep.
He
has
the
bastard,
he
has
the
book,
and
soon
enough
he’ll
have
the
truth.
And
now
his
wife
has
abducted
Tyrion
Lannister,
thanks
to
Littlefinger’s
meddling.
Lord
Tywin
will
take
that
for
an
outrage,
and
Jaime
has
a
queer
affection
for
the
Imp.
If
the
Lannisters
move
north,
that
will
bring
the
Tullys
in
as
well.
Delay,
you
say.
Make
haste,
I
reply.
Even
the
finest
of
jugglers
cannot
keep
a
hundred
balls
in
the
air
forever.”

“You
are
more
than
a
juggler,
old
friend.
You
are
a
true
sorcerer.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
work
your
magic
awhile
longer.”
They
started
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
Arya
had
come,
past
the
room
with
the
monsters.

“What
I
can
do,
I
will,”
the
one
with
the
torch
said
softly.
“I
must
have
gold,
and
another
fifty
birds.”

She
let
them
get
a
long
way
ahead,
then
went
creeping
after
them.
Quiet
as
a
shadow.

“So
many?”
The
voices
were
fainter
as
the
light
dwindled
ahead
of
her.
“The
ones
you
need
are
hard
to
find…
so
young,
to
know
their
letters…
perhaps
older…
not
die
so
easy…”

“No.
The
younger
are
safer…
treat
them
gently…”

“…if
they
kept
their
tongues…”

“…the
risk…”

Long
after
their
voices
had
faded
away,
Arya
could
still
see
the
light
of
the
torch,
a
smoking
star
that
bid
her
follow.
Twice
it
seemed
to
disappear,
but
she
kept
on
straight,
and
both
times
she
found
herself
at
the
top
of
steep,
narrow
stairs,
the
torch
glimmering
far
below
her.
She
hurried
after
it,
down
and
down.
Once
she
stumbled
over
a
rock
and
fell
against
the
wall,
and
her
hand
found
raw
earth
supported
by
timbers,
whereas
before
the
tunnel
had
been
dressed
stone.

She
must
have
crept
after
them
for
miles.
Finally
they
were
gone,
but
there
was
no
place
to
go
but
forward.
She
found
the
wall
again
and
followed,
blind
and
lost,
pretending
that
Nymeria
was
padding
along
beside
her
in
the
darkness.
At
the
end
she
was
knee-deep
in
foul-smelling
water,
wishing
she
could
dance
upon
it
as
Syrio
might
have,
and
wondering
if
she’d
ever
see
light
again.
It
was
full
dark
when
finally
Arya
emerged
into
the
night
air.

She
found
herself
standing
at
the
mouth
of
a
sewer
where
it
emptied
into
the
river.
She
stank
so
badly
that
she
stripped
right
there,
dropping
her
soiled
clothing
on
the
riverbank
as
she
dove
into
the
deep
black
waters.
She
swam
until
she
felt
clean,
and
crawled
out
shivering.
Some
riders
went
past
along
the
river
road
as
Arya
was
washing
her
clothes,
but
if
they
saw
the
scrawny
naked
girl
scrubbing
her
rags
in
the
moonlight,
they
took
no
notice.

She
was
miles
from
the
castle,
but
from
anywhere
in
King’s
Landing
you
needed
only
to
look
up
to
see
the
Red
Keep
high
on
Aegon’s
Hill,
so
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
her
way.
Her
clothes
were
almost
dry
by
the
time
she
reached
the
gatehouse.
The
portcullis
was
down
and
the
gates
barred,
so
she
turned
aside
to
a
postern
door.
The
gold
cloaks
who
had
the
watch
sneered
when
she
told
them
to
let
her
in.
“Off
with
you,”
one
said.
“The
kitchen
scraps
are
gone,
and
we’ll
have
no
begging
after
dark.”

“I’m
not
a
beggar,”
she
said.
“I
live
here.”

“I
said,
off
with
you.
Do
you
need
a
clout
on
the
ear
to
help
your
hearing?”

“I
want
to
see
my
father.”

The
guards
exchanged
a
glance.
“I
want
to
fuck
the
queen
myself,
for
all
the
good
it
does
me,”
the
younger
one
said.

The
older
scowled.
“Who’s
this
father
of
yours,
boy,
the
city
ratcatcher?”

“The
Hand
of
the
King,”
Arya
told
him.

Both
men
laughed,
but
then
the
older
one
swung
his
fist
at
her,
casually,
as
a
man
would
swat
a
dog.
Arya
saw
the
blow
coming
even
before
it
began.
She
danced
back
out
of
the
way,
untouched.
“I’m
not
a
boy,”
she
spat
at
them.
“I’m
Arya
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
my
lord
father
will
have
both
your
heads
on
spikes.
If
you
don’t
believe
me,
fetch
Jory
Cassel
or
Vayon
Poole
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.”
She
put
her
hands
on
her
hips.
“Now
are
you
going
to
open
the
gate,
or
do
you
need
a
clout
on
the
ear
to
help
your
hearing?”

Her
father
was
alone
in
the
solar
when
Harwin
and
Fat
Tom
marched
her
in,
an
oil
lamp
glowing
softly
at
his
elbow.
He
was
bent
over
the
biggest
book
Arya
had
ever
seen,
a
great
thick
tome
with
cracked
yellow
pages
of
crabbed
script,
bound
between
faded
leather
covers,
but
he
closed
it
to
listen
to
Harwin’s
report.
His
face
was
stern
as
he
sent
the
men
away
with
thanks.

“You
realize
I
had
half
my
guard
out
searching
for
you?”
Eddard
Stark
said
when
they
were
alone.
“Septa
Mordane
is
beside
herself
with
fear.
She’s
in
the
sept
praying
for
your
safe
return.
Arya,
you
know
you
are
never
to
go
beyond
the
castle
gates
without
my
leave.”

“I
didn’t
go
out
the
gates,”
she
blurted.
“Well,
I
didn’t
mean
to.
I
was
down
in
the
dungeons,
only
they
turned
into
this
tunnel.
It
was
all
dark,
and
I
didn’t
have
a
torch
or
a
candle
to
see
by,
so
I
had
to
follow.
I
couldn’t
go
back
the
way
I
came
on
account
of
the
monsters.
Father,
they
were
talking
about
killing
you!
Not
the
monsters,
the
two
men.
They
didn’t
see
me,
I
was
being
still
as
stone
and
quiet
as
a
shadow,
but
I
heard
them.
They
said
you
had
a
book
and
a
bastard
and
if
one
Hand
could
die,
why
not
a
second?
Is
that
the
book?
Jon’s
the
bastard,
I
bet.”

“Jon?
Arya,
what
are
you
talking
about?
Who
said
this?”

“They
did,”
she
told
him.
“There
was
a
fat
one
with
rings
and
a
forked
yellow
beard,
and
another
in
mail
and
a
steel
cap,
and
the
fat
one
said
they
had
to
delay
but
the
other
one
told
him
he
couldn’t
keep
juggling
and
the
wolf
and
the
lion
were
going
to
eat
each
other
and
it
was
a
mummer’s
farce.”
She
tried
to
remember
the
rest.
She
hadn’t
quite
understood
everything
she’d
heard,
and
now
it
was
all
mixed
up
in
her
head.
“The
fat
one
said
the
princess
was
with
child.
The
one
in
the
steel
cap,
he
had
the
torch,
he
said
that
they
had
to
hurry.
I
think
he
was
a
wizard.”

“A
wizard,”
said
Ned,
unsmiling.
“Did
he
have
a
long
white
beard
and
tall
pointed
hat
speckled
with
stars?”

“No!
It
wasn’t
like
Old
Nan’s
stories.
He
didn’t
look
like
a
wizard,
but
the
fat
one
said
he
was.”

“I
warn
you,
Arya,
if
you’re
spinning
this
thread
of
air—”

“No,
I
told
you,
it
was
in
the
dungeons,
by
the
place
with
the
secret
wall.
I
was
chasing
cats,
and
well…”
She
screwed
up
her
face.
If
she
admitted
knocking
over
Prince
Tommen,
he
would
be
really
angry
with
her.
“…well,
I
went
in
this
window.
That’s
where
I
found
the
monsters.”

“Monsters
and
wizards,”
her
father
said.
“It
would
seem
you’ve
had
quite
an
adventure.
These
men
you
heard,
you
say
they
spoke
of
juggling
and
mummery?”

“Yes,”
Arya
admitted,
“only—”

“Arya,
they
were
mummers,”
her
father
told
her.
“There
must
be
a
dozen
troupes
in
King’s
Landing
right
now,
come
to
make
some
coin
off
the
tourney
crowds.
I’m
not
certain
what
these
two
were
doing
in
the
castle,
but
perhaps
the
king
has
asked
for
a
show.”

“No.”
She
shook
her
head
stubbornly.
“They
weren’t—”

“You
shouldn’t
be
following
people
about
and
spying
on
them
in
any
case.
Nor
do
I
cherish
the
notion
of
my
daughter
climbing
in
strange
windows
after
stray
cats.
Look
at
you,
sweetling.
Your
arms
are
covered
with
scratches.
This
has
gone
on
long
enough.
Tell
Syrio
Forel
that
I
want
a
word
with
hirn—”

He
was
interrupted
by
a
short,
sudden
knock.
“Lord
Eddard,
pardons,”
Desmond
called
out,
opening
the
door
a
crack,
“but
there’s
a
black
brother
here
begging
audience.
He
says
the
matter
is
urgent.
I
thought
you
would
want
to
know.”

“My
door
is
always
open
to
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Father
said.

Desmond
ushered
the
man
inside.
He
was
stooped
and
ugly,
with
an
unkempt
beard
and
unwashed
clothes,
yet
Father
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
asked
his
name.

“Yoren,
as
it
please
m’lord.
My
pardons
for
the
hour.”
He
bowed
to
Arya.
“And
this
must
be
your
son.
He
has
your
look.”

“I’m
a
girl,”
Arya
said,
exasperated.
If
the
old
man
was
down
from
the
Wall,
he
must
have
come
by
way
of
Winterfell.
“Do
you
know
my
brothers?”
she
asked
excitedly.
“Robb
and
Bran
are
at
Winterfell,
and
Jon’s
on
the
Wall.
Jon
Snow,
he’s
in
the
Night’s
Watch
too,
you
must
know
him,
he
has
a
direwolf,
a
white
one
with
red
eyes.
Is
Jon
a
ranger
yet?
I’m
Arya
Stark.”
The
old
man
in
his
smelly
black
clothes
was
looking
at
her
oddly,
but
Arya
could
not
seem
to
stop
talking.
“When
you
ride
back
to
the
Wall,
would
you
bring
Jon
a
letter
if
I
wrote
one?”
She
wished
Jon
were
here
right
now.
He’d
believe
her
about
the
dungeons
and
the
fat
man
with
the
forked
beard
and
the
wizard
in
the
steel
cap.

“My
daughter
often
forgets
her
courtesies,”
Eddard
Stark
said
with
a
faint
smile
that
softened
his
words.
“I
beg
your
forgiveness,
Yoren.
Did
my
brother
Benjen
send
you?”

“No
one
sent
me,
m’lord,
saving
old
Mormont.
I’m
here
to
find
men
for
the
Wall,
and
when
Robert
next
holds
court,
I’ll
bend
the
knee
and
cry
our
need,
see
if
the
king
and
his
Hand
have
some
scum
in
the
dungeons
they’d
be
well
rid
of.
You
might
say
as
Benjen
Stark
is
why
we’re
talking,
though.
His
blood
ran
black.
Made
him
my
brother
as
much
as
yours.
It’s
for
his
sake
I’m
come.
Rode
hard,
I
did,
near
killed
my
horse
the
way
I
drove
her,
but
I
left
the
others
well
behind.”

“The
others?”

Yoren
spat.
“Sellswords
and
freeriders
and
like
trash.
That
inn
was
full
o’
them,
and
I
saw
them
take
the
scent.
The
scent
of
blood
or
the
scent
of
gold,
they
smell
the
same
in
the
end.
Not
all
o’
them
made
for
King’s
Landing,
either.
Some
went
galloping
for
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
Rock
lies
closer.
Lord
Tywin
will
have
gotten
the
word
by
now,
you
can
count
on
it.”

Father
frowned.
“What
word
is
this?”

Yoren
eyed
Arya.
“One
best
spoken
in
private,
m’lord,
begging
your
pardons.”

“As
you
say.
Desmond,
see
my
daughter
to
her
chambers.”
He
kissed
her
on
the
brow.
“We’ll
finish
our
talk
on
the
morrow.”

Arya
stood
rooted
to
the
spot.
“Nothing
bad’s
happened
to
Jon,
has
it?”
she
asked
Yoren.
“Or
Uncle
Benjen?”

“Well,
as
to
Stark,
I
can’t
say.
The
Snow
boy
was
well
enough
when
I
left
the
Wall.
It’s
not
them
as
concerns
me.”

Desmond
took
her
hand.
“Come
along,
milady.
You
heard
your
lord
father.”

Arya
had
no
choice
but
to
go
with
him,
wishing
it
had
been
Fat
Tom.
With
Tom,
she
might
have
been
able
to
linger
at
the
door
on
some
excuse
and
hear
what
Yoren
was
saying,
but
Desmond
was
too
single-minded
to
trick.
“How
many
guards
does
my
father
have?”
she
asked
him
as
they
descended
to
her
bedchamber.

“Here
at
King’s
Landing?
Fifty.”

“You
wouldn’t
let
anyone
kill
him,
would
you?”
she
asked.

Desmond
laughed.
“No
fear
on
that
count,
little
lady.
Lord
Eddard’s
guarded
night
and
day.
He’ll
come
to
no
harm.”

“The
Lannisters
have
more
than
fifty
men,”
Arya
pointed
out.

“So
they
do,
but
every
northerner
is
worth
ten
of
these
southron
swords,
so
you
can
sleep
easy.”

“What
if
a
wizard
was
sent
to
kill
him?”

“Well,
as
to
that,”
Desmond
replied,
drawing
his
longsword,
“wizards
die
the
same
as
other
men,
once
you
cut
their
heads
off.”





EDDARD

“Robert,
I
beg
of
you,”
Ned
pleaded,
“hear
what
you
are
saying.
You
are
talking
of
murdering
a
child.”

“The
whore
is
pregnant!”
The
king’s
fist
slammed
down
on
the
council
table
loud
as
a
thunderclap.
“I
warned
you
this
would
happen,
Ned.
Back
in
the
barrowlands,
I
warned
you,
but
you
did
not
care
to
hear
it.
Well,
you’ll
hear
it
now.
I
want
them
dead,
mother
and
child
both,
and
that
fool
Viserys
as
well.
Is
that
plain
enough
for
you?
I
want
them
dead.”

The
other
councillors
were
all
doing
their
best
to
pretend
that
they
were
somewhere
else.
No
doubt
they
were
wiser
than
he
was.
Eddard
Stark
had
seldom
felt
quite
so
alone.
“You
will
dishonor
yourself
forever
if
you
do
this.”

“Then
let
it
be
on
my
head,
so
long
as
it
is
done.
I
am
not
so
blind
that
I
cannot
see
the
shadow
of
the
axe
when
it
is
hanging
over
my
own
neck.”

“There
is
no
axe,”
Ned
told
his
king.
“Only
the
shadow
of
a
shadow,
twenty
years
removed…
if
it
exists
at
all.”

“If?”
Varys
asked
softly,
wringing
powdered
hands
together.
“My
lord,
you
wrong
me.
Would
I
bring
ties
to
king
and
council?”

Ned
looked
at
the
eunuch
coldly.
“You
would
bring
us
the
whisperings
of
a
traitor
half
a
world
away,
my
lord.
Perhaps
Mormont
is
wrong.
Perhaps
he
is
lying.”

“Ser
Jorah
would
not
dare
deceive
me,”
Varys
said
with
a
sly
smile.
“Rely
on
it,
my
lord.
The
princess
is
with
child.”

“So
you
say.
If
you
are
wrong,
we
need
not
fear.
If
the
girl
miscarries,
we
need
not
fear.
If
she
births
a
daughter
in
place
of
a
son,
we
need
not
fear.
If
the
babe
dies
in
infancy,
we
need
not
fear.”

“But
if
it
is
a
boy?”
Robert
insisted.
“If
he
lives?”

“The
narrow
sea
would
still
lie
between
us.
I
shall
fear
the
Dothraki
the
day
they
teach
their
horses
to
run
on
water.”

The
king
took
a
swallow
of
wine
and
glowered
at
Ned
across
the
council
table.
“So
you
would
counsel
me
to
do
nothing
until
the
dragonspawn
has
landed
his
army
on
my
shores,
is
that
it?”

“This
‘dragonspawn’
is
in
his
mother’s
belly,”
Ned
said.
“Even
Aegon
did
no
conquering
until
after
he
was
weaned.”

“Gods!
You
are
stubborn
as
an
aurochs,
Stark.”
The
king
looked
around
the
council
table.
“Have
the
rest
of
you
mislaid
your
tongues?
Will
no
one
talk
sense
to
this
frozen-faced
fool?”

Varys
gave
the
king
an
unctuous
smile
and
laid
a
soft
hand
on
Ned’s
sleeve.
“I
understand
your
qualms,
Lord
Eddard,
truly
I
do.
It
gave
me
no
joy
to
bring
this
grievous
news
to
council.
It
is
a
terrible
thing
we
contemplate,
a
vile
thing.
Yet
we
who
presume
to
rule
must
do
vile
things
for
the
good
of
the
realm,
howevermuch
it
pains
us.”

Lord
Renly
shrugged.
“The
matter
seems
simple
enough
to
me.
We
ought
to
have
had
Viserys
and
his
sister
killed
years
ago,
but
His
Grace
my
brother
made
the
mistake
of
listening
to
Jon
Arryn.”

“Mercy
is
never
a
mistake,
Lord
Renly,”
Ned
replied.
“On
the
Trident,
Ser
Barristan
here
cut
down
a
dozen
good
men,
Robert’s
friends
and
mine.
When
they
brought
him
to
us,
grievously
wounded
and
near
death,
Roose
Bolton
urged
us
to
cut
his
throat,
but
your
brother
said,
‘I
will
not
kill
a
man
for
loyalty,
nor
for
fighting
well,’
and
sent
his
own
maester
to
tend
Ser
Barristan’s
wounds.”
He
gave
the
king
a
long
cool
look.
“Would
that
man
were
here
today.”

Robert
had
shame
enough
to
blush.
“It
was
not
the
same,”
he
complained.
“Ser
Barristan
was
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Whereas
Daenerys
is
a
fourteen-year-old
girl.”
Ned
knew
he
was
pushing
this
well
past
the
point
of
wisdom,
yet
he
could
not
keep
silent.
“Robert,
I
ask
you,
what
did
we
rise
against
Aerys
Targaryen
for,
if
not
to
put
an
end
to
the
murder
of
children?”

“To
put
an
end
to
Targaryens!”
the
king
growled.

“Your
Grace,
I
never
knew
you
to
fear
Rhaegar.”
Ned
fought
to
keep
the
scorn
out
of
his
voice,
and
failed.
“Have
the
years
so
unmanned
you
that
you
tremble
at
the
shadow
of
an
unborn
child?”

Robert
purpled.
“No
more,
Ned,”
he
warned,
pointing.
“Not
another
word.
Have
you
forgotten
who
is
king
here?”

“No,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
replied.
“Have
you?”

“Enough!”
the
king
bellowed.
“I
am
sick
of
talk.
I’ll
be
done
with
this,
or
be
damned.
What
say
you
all?”

“She
must
be
killed,”
Lord
Renly
declared.

“We
have
no
choice,”
murmured
Varys.
“Sadly,
sadly…”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
raised
his
pale
blue
eyes
from
the
table
and
said,
“Your
Grace,
there
is
honor
in
facing
an
enemy
on
the
battlefield,
but
none
in
killing
him
in
his
mother’s
womb.
Forgive
me,
but
I
must
stand
with
Lord
Eddard.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat,
a
process
that
seemed
to
take
some
minutes.
“My
order
serves
the
realm,
not
the
ruler.
Once
I
counseled
King
Aerys
as
loyally
as
I
counsel
King
Robert
now,
so
I
bear
this
girl
child
of
his
no
ill
will.
Yet
I
ask
you
this—should
war
come
again,
how
many
soldiers
will
die?
How
many
towns
will
burn?
How
many
children
will
be
ripped
from
their
mothers
to
perish
on
the
end
of
a
spear?”
He
stroked
his
luxuriant
white
beard,
infinitely
sad,
infinitely
weary.
“Is
it
not
wiser,
even
kinder,
that
Daenerys
Targaryen
should
die
now
so
that
tens
of
thousands
might
live?”

“Kinder,”
Varys
said.
“Oh,
well
and
truly
spoken,
Grand
Maester.
It
is
so
true.
Should
the
gods
in
their
caprice
grant
Daenerys
Targaryen
a
son,
the
realm
must
bleed.”

Littlefinger
was
the
last.
As
Ned
looked
to
him,
Lord
Petyr
stifled
a
yawn.
“When
you
find
yourself
in
bed
with
an
ugly
woman,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
close
your
eyes
and
get
on
with
it,”
he
declared.
“Waiting
won’t
make
the
maid
any
prettier.
Kiss
her
and
be
done
with
it.”

“Kiss
her?”
Ser
Barristan
repeated,
aghast.

“A
steel
kiss,”
said
Littlefinger.

Robert
turned
to
face
his
Hand.
“Well,
there
it
is,
Ned.
You
and
Selmy
stand
alone
on
this
matter.
The
only
question
that
remains
is,
who
can
we
find
to
kill
her?”

“Mormont
craves
a
royal
pardon,”
Lord
Renly
reminded
them.

“Desperately,”
Varys
said,
“yet
he
craves
life
even
more.
By
now,
the
princess
nears
Vaes
Dothrak,
where
it
is
death
to
draw
a
blade.
If
I
told
you
what
the
Dothraki
would
do
to
the
poor
man
who
used
one
on
a
khaleesi,
none
of
you
would
sleep
tonight.”
He
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
“Now,
poison…
the
tears
of
Lys,
let
us
say.
Khal
Drogo
need
never
know
it
was
not
a
natural
death.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle’s
sleepy
eyes
flicked
open.
He
squinted
suspiciously
at
the
eunuch.

“Poison
is
a
coward’s
weapon,”
the
king
complained.

Ned
had
heard
enough.
“You
send
hired
knives
to
kill
a
fourteen-year-old
girl
and
still
quibble
about
honor?”
He
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood.
“Do
it
yourself,
Robert.
The
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
sword.
Look
her
in
the
eyes
before
you
kill
her.
See
her
tears,
hear
her
last
words.
You
owe
her
that
much
at
least.”

“Gods,”
the
king
swore,
the
word
exploding
out
of
him
as
if
he
could
barely
contain
his
fury.
“You
mean
it,
damn
you.”
He
reached
for
the
flagon
of
wine
at
his
elbow,
found
it
empty,
and
flung
it
away
to
shatter
against
the
wall.
“I
am
out
of
wine
and
out
of
patience.
Enough
of
this.
Just
have
it
done.”

“I
will
not
be
part
of
murder,
Robert.
Do
as
you
will,
but
do
not
ask
me
to
fix
my
seal
to
it.”

For
a
moment
Robert
did
not
seem
to
understand
what
Ned
was
saying.
Defiance
was
not
a
dish
he
tasted
often.
Slowly
his
face
changed
as
comprehension
came.
His
eyes
narrowed
and
a
flush
crept
up
his
neck
past
the
velvet
collar.
He
pointed
an
angry
finger
at
Ned.
“You
are
the
King’s
Hand,
Lord
Stark.
You
will
do
as
I
command
you,
or
I’ll
find
me
a
Hand
who
will.”

“I
wish
him
every
success.”
Ned
unfastened
the
heavy
clasp
that
clutched
at
the
folds
of
his
cloak,
the
ornate
silver
hand
that
was
his
badge
of
office.
He
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
king,
saddened
by
the
memory
of
the
man
who
had
pinned
it
on
him,
the
friend
he
had
loved.
“I
thought
you
a
better
man
than
this,
Robert.
I
thought
we
had
made
a
nobler
king.”

Robert’s
face
was
purple.
“Out,”
he
croaked,
choking
on
his
rage.
“Out,
damn
you,
I’m
done
with
you.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Go,
run
back
to
Winterfell.
And
make
certain
I
never
look
on
your
face
again,
or
I
swear,
I’ll
have
your
head
on
a
spike!”

Ned
bowed,
and
turned
on
his
heel
without
another
word.
He
could
feel
Robert’s
eyes
on
his
back.
As
he
strode
from
the
council
chambers,
the
discussion
resumed
with
scarcely
a
pause.
“On
Braavos
there
is
a
society
called
the
Faceless
Men,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
offered.

“Do
you
have
any
idea
how
costly
they
are?”
Littlefinger
complained.
“You
could
hire
an
army
of
common
sellswords
for
half
the
price,
and
that’s
for
a
merchant.
I
don’t
dare
think
what
they
might
ask
for
a
princess.”

The
closing
of
the
door
behind
him
silenced
the
voices.
Ser
Boros
Blount
was
stationed
outside
the
chamber,
wearing
the
long
white
cloak
and
armor
of
the
Kingsguard.
He
gave
Ned
a
quick,
curious
glance
from
the
corner
of
his
eye,
but
asked
no
questions.

The
day
felt
heavy
and
oppressive
as
he
crossed
the
bailey
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
He
could
feel
the
threat
of
rain
in
the
air.
Ned
would
have
welcomed
it.
It
might
have
made
him
feel
a
trifle
less
unclean.
When
he
reached
his
solar,
he
summoned
Vayon
Poole.
The
steward
came
at
once.
“You
sent
for
me,
my
lord
Hand?”

“Hand
no
longer,”
Ned
told
him.
“The
king
and
I
have
quarreled.
We
shall
be
returning
to
Winterfell.”

“I
shall
begin
making
arrangements
at
once,
my
lord.
We
will
need
a
fortnight
to
ready
everything
for
the
journey.”

“We
may
not
have
a
fortnight.
We
may
not
have
a
day.
The
king
mentioned
something
about
seeing
my
head
on
a
spike.”
Ned
frowned.
He
did
not
truly
believe
the
king
would
harm
him,
not
Robert.
He
was
angry
now,
but
once
Ned
was
safely
out
of
sight,
his
rage
would
cool
as
it
always
did.

Always?
Suddenly,
uncomfortably,
he
found
himself
recalling
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
Fifteen
years
dead,
yet
Robert
hates
him
as
much
as
ever.
It
was
a
disturbing
notion…
and
there
was
the
other
matter,
the
business
with
Catelyn
and
the
dwarf
that
Yoren
had
warned
him
of
last
night.
That
would
come
to
light
soon,
as
sure
as
sunrise,
and
with
the
king
in
such
a
black
fury…
Robert
might
not
care
a
fig
for
Tyrion
Lannister,
but
it
would
touch
on
his
pride,
and
there
was
no
telling
what
the
queen
might
do.

“It
might
be
safest
if
I
went
on
ahead,”
he
told
Poole.
“I
will
take
my
daughters
and
a
few
guardsmen.
The
rest
of
you
can
follow
when
you
are
ready.
Inform
Jory,
but
tell
no
one
else,
and
do
nothing
until
the
girls
and
I
have
gone.
The
castle
is
full
of
eyes
and
ears,
and
I
would
rather
my
plans
were
not
known.”

“As
you
command,
my
lord.”

When
he
had
gone,
Eddard
Stark
went
to
the
window
and
sat
brooding.
Robert
had
left
him
no
choice
that
he
could
see.
He
ought
to
thank
him.
It
would
be
good
to
return
to
Winterfell.
He
ought
never
have
left.
His
sons
were
waiting
there.
Perhaps
he
and
Catelyn
would
make
a
new
son
together
when
he
returned,
they
were
not
so
old
yet.
And
of
late
he
had
often
found
himself
dreaming
of
snow,
of
the
deep
quiet
of
the
wolfswood
at
night.

And
yet,
the
thought
of
leaving
angered
him
as
well.
So
much
was
still
undone.
Robert
and
his
council
of
cravens
and
flatterers
would
beggar
the
realm
if
left
unchecked…
or,
worse,
sell
it
to
the
Lannisters
in
payment
of
their
loans.
And
the
truth
of
Jon
Arryn’s
death
still
eluded
him.
Oh,
he
had
found
a
few
pieces,
enough
to
convince
him
that
Jon
had
indeed
been
murdered,
but
that
was
no
more
than
the
spoor
of
an
animal
on
the
forest
floor.
He
had
not
sighted
the
beast
itself
yet,
though
he
sensed
it
was
there,
lurking,
hidden,
treacherous.

It
struck
him
suddenly
that
he
might
return
to
Winterfell
by
sea.
Ned
was
no
sailor,
and
ordinarily
would
have
preferred
the
kingsroad,
but
if
he
took
ship
he
could
stop
at
Dragonstone
and
speak
with
Stannis
Baratheon.
Pycelle
had
sent
a
raven
off
across
the
water,
with
a
polite
letter
from
Ned
requesting
Lord
Stannis
to
return
to
his
seat
on
the
small
council.
As
yet,
there
had
been
no
reply,
but
the
silence
only
deepened
his
suspicions.
Lord
Stannis
shared
the
secret
Jon
Arryn
had
died
for,
he
was
certain
of
it.
The
truth
he
sought
might
very
well
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
ancient
island
fortress
of
House
Targaryen.

And
when
you
have
it,
what
then?
Some
secrets
are
safer
kept
hidden.
Some
secrets
are
too
dangerous
to
share,
even
with
those
you
love
and
trust.
Ned
slid
the
dagger
that
Catelyn
had
brought
him
out
of
the
sheath
on
his
belt.
The
Imp’s
knife.
Why
would
the
dwarf
want
Bran
dead?
To
silence
him,
surely.
Another
secret,
or
only
a
different
strand
of
the
same
web?

Could
Robert
be
part
of
it?
He
would
not
have
thought
so,
but
once
he
would
not
have
thought
Robert
could
command
the
murder
of
women
and
children
either.
Catelyn
had
tried
to
warn
him.
You
knew
the
man,
she
had
said.
The
king
is
a
stranger
to
you.
The
sooner
he
was
quit
of
King’s
Landing,
the
better.
If
there
was
a
ship
sailing
north
on
the
morrow,
it
would
be
well
to
be
on
it.

He
summoned
Vayon
Poole
again
and
sent
him
to
the
docks
to
make
inquiries,
quietly
but
quickly.
“Find
me
a
fast
ship
with
a
skilled
captain,”
he
told
the
steward.
“I
care
nothing
for
the
size
of
its
cabins
or
the
quality
of
its
appointments,
so
long
as
it
is
swift
and
safe.
I
wish
to
leave
at
once.”

Poole
had
no
sooner
taken
his
leave
than
Tomard
announced
a
visitor.
“Lord
Baelish
to
see
you,
m’lord.”

Ned
was
half-tempted
to
turn
him
away,
but
thought
better
of
it.
He
was
not
free
yet;
until
he
was,
he
must
play
their
games.
“Show
him
in,
Tom.”

Lord
Petyr
sauntered
into
the
solar
as
if
nothing
had
gone
amiss
that
morning.
He
wore
a
slashed
velvet
doublet
in
cream-and-silver,
a
grey
silk
cloak
trimmed
with
black
fox,
and
his
customary
mocking
smile.

Ned
greeted
him
coldly.
“Might
I
ask
the
reason
for
this
visit,
Lord
Baelish?”

“I
won’t
detain
you
long,
I’m
on
my
way
to
dine
with
Lady
Tanda.
Lamprey
pie
and
roast
suckling
pig.
She
has
some
thought
to
wed
me
to
her
younger
daughter,
so
her
table
is
always
astonishing.
If
truth
be
told,
I’d
sooner
marry
the
pig,
but
don’t
tell
her.
I
do
love
lamprey
pie.”

“Don’t
let
me
keep
you
from
your
eels,
my
lord,”
Ned
said
with
icy
disdain.
“At
the
moment,
I
cannot
think
of
anyone
whose
company
I
desire
less
than
yours.”

“Oh,
I’m
certain
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it,
you
could
come
up
with
a
few
names.
Varys,
say.
Cersei.
Or
Robert.
His
Grace
is
most
wroth
with
you.
He
went
on
about
you
at
some
length
after
you
took
your
leave
of
us
this
morning.
The
words
insolence
and
ingratitude
came
into
it
frequently,
I
seem
to
recall.”

Ned
did
not
honor
that
with
a
reply.
Nor
did
he
offer
his
guest
a
seat,
but
Littlefinger
took
one
anyway.
“After
you
stormed
out,
it
was
left
to
me
to
convince
them
not
to
hire
the
Faceless
Men,”
he
continued
blithely.
“Instead
Varys
will
quietly
let
it
be
known
that
we’ll
make
a
lord
of
whoever
does
in
the
Targaryen
girl.”

Ned
was
disgusted.
“So
now
we
grant
titles
to
assassins.”

Littlefinger
shrugged.
“Titles
are
cheap.
The
Faceless
Men
are
expensive.
If
truth
be
told,
I
did
the
Targaryen
girl
more
good
than
you
with
all
your
talk
of
honor.
Let
some
sellsword
drunk
on
visions
of
lordship
try
to
kill
her.
Likely
he’ll
make
a
botch
of
it,
and
afterward
the
Dothraki
will
be
on
their
guard.
If
we’d
sent
a
Faceless
Man
after
her,
she’d
be
as
good
as
buried.”

Ned
frowned.
“You
sit
in
council
and
talk
of
ugly
women
and
steel
kisses,
and
now
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
tried
to
protect
the
girl?
How
big
a
fool
do
you
take
me
for?”

“Well,
quite
an
enormous
one,
actually,”
said
Littlefinger,
laughing.

“Do
you
always
find
murder
so
amusing,
Lord
Baelish?”

“It’s
not
murder
I
find
amusing,
Lord
Stark,
it’s
you.
You
rule
like
a
man
dancing
on
rotten
ice.
I
daresay
you
will
make
a
noble
splash.
I
believe
I
heard
the
first
crack
this
morning.”

“The
first
and
last,”
said
Ned.
“I’ve
had
my
fill.”

“When
do
you
mean
to
return
to
Winterfell,
my
lord?”

“As
soon
as
I
can.
What
concern
is
that
of
yours?”

“None…
but
if
perchance
you’re
still
here
come
evenfall,
I’d
be
pleased
to
take
you
to
this
brothel
your
man
Jory
has
been
searching
for
so
ineffectually.”
Littlefinger
smiled.
“And
I
won’t
even
tell
the
Lady
Catelyn.”

CATELYN

<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
It
was
full
dark
before
they
found
the
village.
Catelyn
found
herself
wondering
if
the
place
had
a
name.
If
so,
its
people
had
taken
that
knowledge
with
them
when
they
fled,
along
with
all
they
owned,
down
to
the
candles
in
the
sept.
Ser
Wendel
lit
a
torch
and
led
her
through
the
low
door.

Within,
the
seven
walls
were
cracked
and
crooked.
God
is
one,
Septon
Osmynd
had
taught
her
when
she
was
a
girl,
with
seven
aspects,
as
the
sept
is
a
single
building,
with
seven
walls.
The
wealthy
septs
of
the
cities
had
statues
of
the
Seven
and
an
altar
to
each.
In
Winterfell,
Septon
Chayle
hung
carved
masks
from
each
wall.
Here
Catelyn
found
only
rough
charcoal
drawings.
Ser
Wendel
set
the
torch
in
a
sconce
near
the
door,
and
left
to
wait
outside
with
Robar
Royce.

Catelyn
studied
the
faces.
The
Father
was
bearded,
as
ever.
The
Mother
smiled,
loving
and
protective.
The
Warrior
had
his
sword
sketched
in
beneath
his
face,
the
Smith
his
hammer.
The
Maid
was
beautiful,
the
Crone
wizened
and
wise.

And
the
seventh
face…
the
Stranger
was
neither
male
nor
female,
yet
both,
ever
the
outcast,
the
wanderer
from
far
places,
less
and
more
than
human,
unknown
and
unknowable.
Here
the
face
was
a
black
oval,
a
shadow
with
stars
for
eyes.
It
made
Catelyn
uneasy.
She
would
get
scant
comfort
there.

She
knelt
before
the
Mother.
“My
lady,
look
down
on
this
battle
with
a
mother’s
eyes.
They
are
all
sons,
every
one.
Spare
them
if
you
can,
and
spare
my
own
sons
as
well.
Watch
over
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon.
Would
that
I
were
with
them.”

A
crack
ran
down
through
the
Mother’s
left
eye.
It
made
her
look
as
if
she
were
crying.
Catelyn
could
hear
Ser
Wendel’s
booming
voice,
and
now
and
again
Ser
Robar’s
quiet
answers,
as
they
talked
of
the
coming
battle.
Otherwise
the
night
was
still.
Not
even
a
cricket
could
be
heard,
and
the
gods
kept
their
silence.
Did
your
old
gods
ever
answer
you,
Ned?
she
wondered.
When
you
knelt
before
your
heart
tree,
did
they
hear
you?

Flickering
torchlight
danced
across
the
walls,
making
the
faces
seem
half
alive,
twisting
them,
changing
them.
The
statues
in
the
great
septs
of
the
cities
wore
the
faces
the
stonemasons
had
given
them,
but
these
charcoal
scratchings
were
so
crude
they
might
be
anyone.
The
Father’s
face
made
her
think
of
her
own
father,
dying
in
his
bed
at
Riverrun.
The
Warrior
was
Renly
and
Stannis,
Robb
and
Robert,
Jaime
Lannister
and
Jon
Snow.
She
even
glimpsed
Arya
in
those
lines,
just
for
an
instant.
Then
a
gust
of
wind
through
the
door
made
the
torch
sputter,
and
the
semblance
was
gone,
washed
away
in
orange
glare.

The
smoke
was
making
her
eyes
burn.
She
rubbed
at
them
with
the
heels
of
her
scarred
hands.
When
she
looked
up
at
the
Mother
again,
it
was
her
own
mother
she
saw.
Lady
Minisa
Tully
had
died
in
childbed,
trying
to
give
Lord
Hoster
a
second
son.
The
baby
had
perished
with
her,
and
afterward
some
of
the
life
had
gone
out
of
Father.
She
was
always
so
calm,
Catelyn
thought,
remembering
her
mother’s
soft
hands,
her
warm
smile.
If
she
had
lived,
how
different
our
lives
might
have
been.
She
wondered
what
Lady
Minisa
would
make
of
her
eldest
daughter,
kneeling
here
before
her.
I
have
come
so
many
thousands
of
leagues,
and
for
what?
Who
have
I
served?
I
have
lost
my
daughters,
Robb
does
not
want
me,
and
Bran
and
Rickon
must
surely
think
me
a
cold
and
unnatural
mother.
I
was
not
even
with
Ned
when
he
died…

Her
head
swam,
and
the
sept
seemed
to
move
around
her.
The
shadows
swayed
and
shifted,
furtive
animals
racing
across
the
cracked
white
walls.
Catelyn
had
not
eaten
today.
Perhaps
that
had
been
unwise.
She
told
herself
that
there
had
been
no
time,
but
the
truth
was
that
food
had
lost
its
savor
in
a
world
without
Ned.
When
they
took
his
head
off,
they
killed
me
too.

Behind
her
the
torch
spit,
and
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
her
sister’s
face
on
the
wall,
though
the
eyes
were
harder
than
she
recalled,
not
Lysa’s
eyes
but
Cersei’s.
Cersei
is
a
mother
too.
No
matter
who
fathered
those
children,
she
felt
them
kick
inside
her,
brought
them
forth
with
her
pain
and
blood,
nursed
them
at
her
breast.
If
they
are
truly
Jaime’s…

“Does
Cersei
pray
to
you
too,
my
lady?”
Catelyn
asked
the
Mother.
She
could
see
the
proud,
cold,
lovely
features
of
the
Lannister
queen
etched
upon
the
wall.
The
crack
was
still
there;
even
Cersei
could
weep
for
her
children.
“Each
of
the
Seven
embodies
all
of
the
Seven,”
Septon
Osmynd
had
told
her
once.
There
was
as
much
beauty
in
the
Crone
as
in
the
Maiden,
and
the
Mother
could
be
fiercer
than
the
Warrior
when
her
children
were
in
danger.
Yes…

She
had
seen
enough
of
Robert
Baratheon
at
Winterfell
to
know
that
the
king
did
not
regard
Joffrey
with
any
great
warmth.
If
the
boy
was
truly
Jaime’s
seed,
Robert
would
have
put
him
to
death
along
with
his
mother,
and
few
would
have
condemned
him.
Bastards
were
common
enough,
but
incest
was
a
monstrous
sin
to
both
old
gods
and
new,
and
the
children
of
such
wickedness
were
named
abominations
in
sept
and
godswood
alike.
The
dragon
kings
had
wed
brother
to
sister,
but
they
were
the
blood
of
old
Valyria
where
such
practices
had
been
common,
and
like
their
dragons
the
Targaryens
answered
to
neither
gods
nor
men.

Ned
must
have
known,
and
Lord
Arryn
before
him.
Small
wonder
that
the
queen
had
killed
them
both.
Would
I
do
any
less
for
my
own?
Catelyn
clenched
her
hands,
feeling
the
tightness
in
her
scarred
fingers
where
the
assassin’s
steel
had
cut
to
the
bone
as
she
fought
to
save
her
son.
“Bran
knows
too,”
she
whispered,
lowering
her
head.
Gods
be
good,
he
must
have
seen
something,
heard
something,
that
was
why
they
tried
to
kill
him
in
his
bed.

Lost
and
weary,
Catelyn
Stark
gave
herself
over
to
her
gods.
She
knelt
before
the
Smith,
who
fixed
things
that
were
broken,
and
asked
that
he
give
her
sweet
Bran
his
protection.
She
went
to
the
Maid
and
beseeched
her
to
lend
her
courage
to
Arya
and
Sansa,
to
guard
them
in
their
innocence.
To
the
Father,
she
prayed
for
justice,
the
strength
to
seek
it
and
the
wisdom
to
know
it,
and
she
asked
the
Warrior
to
keep
Robb
strong
and
shield
him
in
his
battles.
Lastly
she
turned
to
the
Crone,
whose
statues
often
showed
her
with
a
lamp
in
one
hand.
“Guide
me,
wise
lady,”
she
prayed.
“Show
me
the
path
I
must
walk,
and
do
not
let
me
stumble
in
the
dark
places
that
lie
ahead.”

Finally
there
were
footsteps
behind
her,
and
a
noise
at
the
door.
“My
lady,”
Ser
Robar
said
gently,
“pardon,
but
our
time
is
at
an
end.
We
must
be
back
before
the
dawn
breaks.”

Catelyn
rose
stiffly.
Her
knees
ached,
and
she
would
have
given
much
for
a
featherbed
and
a
pillow
just
then.
“Thank
you,
ser.
I
am
ready.”

They
rode
in
silence
through
sparse
woodland
where
the
trees
leaned
drunkenly
away
from
the
sea.
The
nervous
whinny
of
horses
and
the
clank
of
steel
guided
them
back
to
Renly’s
camp.
The
long
ranks
of
man
and
horse
were
armored
in
darkness,
as
black
as
if
the
Smith
had
hammered
night
itself
into
steel.
There
were
banners
to
her
right,
banners
to
her
left,
and
rank
on
rank
of
banners
before
her,
but
in
the
predawn
gloom,
neither
colors
nor
sigils
could
be
discerned.
A
grey
army,
Catelyn
thought.
Grey
men
on
grey
horses
beneath
grey
banners.
As
they
sat
their
horses
waiting,
Renly’s
shadow
knights
pointed
their
lances
upward,
so
she
rode
through
a
forest
of
tall
naked
trees,
bereft
of
leaves
and
life.
Where
Storm’s
End
stood
was
only
a
deeper
darkness,
a
wall
of
black
through
which
no
stars
could
shine,
but
she
could
see
torches
moving
across
the
fields
where
Lord
Stannis
had
made
his
camp.

The
candles
within
Renly’s
pavilion
made
the
shimmering
silken
walls
seem
to
glow,
transforming
the
great
tent
into
a
magical
castle
alive
with
emerald
light.
Two
of
the
Rainbow
Guard
stood
sentry
at
the
door
to
the
royal
pavilion.
The
green
light
shone
strangely
against
the
purple
plums
of
Ser
Parmen’s
surcoat,
and
gave
a
sickly
hue
to
the
sunflowers
that
covered
every
inch
of
Ser
Emmon’s
enameled
yellow
plate.
Long
silken
plumes
flew
from
their
helms,
and
rainbow
cloaks
draped
their
shoulders.

Within,
Catelyn
found
Brienne
armoring
the
king
for
battle
while
the
Lords
Tarly
and
Rowan
spoke
of
dispositions
and
tactics.
It
was
pleasantly
warm
inside,
the
heat
shimmering
off
the
coals
in
a
dozen
small
iron
braziers.
“I
must
speak
with
you,
Your
Grace,”
she
said,
granting
him
a
king’s
style
for
once,
anything
to
make
him
heed
her.

“In
a
moment,
Lady
Catelyn,”
Renly
replied.
Brienne
fit
backplate
to
breastplate
over
his
quilted
tunic.
The
king’s
armor
was
a
deep
green,
the
green
of
leaves
in
a
summer
wood,
so
dark
it
drank
the
candlelight.
Gold
highlights
gleamed
from
inlay
and
fastenings
like
distant
fires
in
that
wood,
winking
every
time
he
moved.
“Pray
continue,
Lord
Mathis.”

“Your
Grace,”
Mathis
Rowan
said
with
a
sideways
glance
at
Catelyn.
“As
I
was
saying,
our
battles
are
well
drawn
up.
Why
wait
for
daybreak?
Sound
the
advance.”

“And
have
it
said
that
I
won
by
treachery,
with
an
unchivalrous
attack?
Dawn
was
the
chosen
hour.”

“Chosen
by
Stannis,”
Randyll
Tarly
pointed
out.
“He’d
have
us
charge
into
the
teeth
of
the
rising
sun.
We’ll
be
half-blind.”

“Only
until
first
shock,”
Renly
said
confidently.
“Ser
Loras
will
break
them,
and
after
that
it
will
be
chaos.”
Brienne
tightened
green
leather
straps
and
buckled
golden
buckles.
“When
my
brother
falls,
see
that
no
insult
is
done
to
his
corpse.
He
is
my
own
blood,
I
will
not
have
his
head
paraded
about
on
a
spear.”

“And
if
he
yields?”
Lord
Tarly
asked.

“Yields?”
Lord
Rowan
laughed.
“When
Mace
Tyrell
laid
siege
to
Storm’s
End,
Stannis
ate
rats
rather
than
open
his
gates.”

“Well
I
remember.”
Renly
lifted
his
chin
to
allow
Brienne
to
fasten
his
gorget
in
place.
“Near
the
end,
Ser
Gawen
Wylde
and
three
of
his
knights
tried
to
steal
out
a
postern
gate
to
surrender.
Stannis
caught
them
and
ordered
them
flung
from
the
walls
with
catapults.
I
can
still
see
Gawen’s
face
as
they
strapped
him
down.
He
had
been
our
master-at-arms.”

Lord
Rowan
appeared
puzzled.
“No
men
were
hurled
from
the
walls.
I
would
surely
remember
that.”

“Maester
Cressen
told
Stannis
that
we
might
be
forced
to
eat
our
dead,
and
there
was
no
gain
in
flinging
away
good
meat.”
Renly
pushed
back
his
hair.
Brienne
bound
it
with
a
velvet
tie
and
pulled
a
padded
cap
down
over
his
ears,
to
cushion
the
weight
of
his
helm.
“Thanks
to
the
Onion
Knight
we
were
never
reduced
to
dining
on
corpses,
but
it
was
a
close
thing.
Too
close
for
Ser
Gawen,
who
died
in
his
cell.”

“Your
Grace.”
Catelyn
had
waited
patiently,
but
time
grew
short.
“You
promised
me
a
word.”

Renly
nodded.
“See
to
your
battles,
my
lords…
oh,
and
if
Barristan
Selmy
is
at
my
brother’s
side,
I
want
him
spared.”

“There’s
been
no
word
of
Ser
Barristan
since
Joffrey
cast
him
out,”
Lord
Rowan
objected.

“I
know
that
old
man.
He
needs
a
king
to
guard,
or
who
is
he?
Yet
he
never
came
to
me,
and
Lady
Catelyn
says
he
is
not
with
Robb
Stark
at
Riverrun.
Where
else
but
with
Stannis?”

“As
you
say,
Your
Grace.
No
harm
will
come
to
him.”
The
lords
bowed
deeply
and
departed.

“Say
your
say,
Lady
Stark,”
Renly
said.
Brienne
swept
his
cloak
over
his
broad
shoulders.
It
was
cloth-of-gold,
heavy,
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
picked
out
in
flakes
of
jet.

“The
Lannisters
tried
to
kill
my
son
Bran.
A
thousand
times
I
have
asked
myself
why.
Your
brother
gave
me
my
answer.
There
was
a
hunt
the
day
he
fell.
Robert
and
Ned
and
most
of
the
other
men
rode
out
after
boar,
but
Jaime
Lannister
remained
at
Winterfell,
as
did
the
queen.”

Renly
was
not
slow
to
take
the
implication.
“So
you
believe
the
boy
caught
them
at
their
incest…”

“I
beg
you,
my
lord,
grant
me
leave
to
go
to
your
brother
Stannis
and
tell
him
what
I
suspect.”

“To
what
end?”

“Robb
will
set
aside
his
crown
if
you
and
your
brother
will
do
the
same,”
she
said,
hoping
it
was
true.
She
would
make
it
true
if
she
must;
Robb
would
listen
to
her,
even
if
his
lords
would
not.
“Let
the
three
of
you
call
for
a
Great
Council,
such
as
the
realm
has
not
seen
for
a
hundred
years.
We
will
send
to
Winterfell,
so
Bran
may
tell
his
tale
and
all
men
may
know
the
Lannisters
for
the
true
usurpers.
Let
the
assembled
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
choose
who
shall
rule
them.”

Renly
laughed.
“Tell
me,
my
lady,
do
direwolves
vote
on
who
should
lead
the
pack?”
Brienne
brought
the
king’s
gauntlets
and
greathelm,
crowned
with
golden
antlers
that
would
add
a
foot
and
a
half
to
his
height.
“The
time
for
talk
is
done.
Now
we
see
who
is
stronger.”
Renly
pulled
a
lobstered
green-and-gold
gauntlet
over
his
left
hand,
while
Brienne
knelt
to
buckle
on
his
belt,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
longsword
and
dagger.

“I
beg
you
in
the
name
of
the
Mother,”
Catelyn
began
when
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
flung
open
the
door
of
the
tent.
She
thought
she
glimpsed
movement,
but
when
she
turned
her
head,
it
was
only
the
king’s
shadow
shifting
against
the
silken
walls.
She
heard
Renly
begin
a
jest,
his
shadow
moving,
lifting
its
sword,
black
on
green,
candles
guttering,
shivering,
something
was
queer,
wrong,
and
then
she
saw
Renly’s
sword
still
in
its
scabbard,
sheathed
still,
but
the
shadowsword…

“Cold,”
said
Renly
in
a
small
puzzled
voice,
a
heartbeat
before
the
steel
of
his
gorget
parted
like
cheesecloth
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
blade
that
was
not
there.
He
had
time
to
make
a
small
thick
gasp
before
the
blood
came
gushing
out
of
his
throat.

“Your
Gr—no!”
cried
Brienne
the
Blue
when
she
saw
that
evil
flow,
sounding
as
scared
as
any
little
girl.
The
king
stumbled
into
her
arms,
a
sheet
of
blood
creeping
down
the
front
of
his
armor,
a
dark
red
tide
that
drowned
his
green
and
gold.
More
candles
guttered
out.
Renly
tried
to
speak,
but
he
was
choking
on
his
own
blood.
His
legs
collapsed,
and
only
Brienne’s
strength
held
him
up.
She
threw
back
her
head
and
screamed,
wordless
in
her
anguish.

The
shadow.
Something
dark
and
evil
had
happened
here,
she
knew,
something
that
she
could
not
begin
to
understand.
Renly
never
cast
that
shadow.
Death
came
in
that
door
and
blew
the
life
out
of
him
as
swift
as
the
wind
snuffed
out
his
candles.

Only
a
few
instants
passed
before
Robar
Royce
and
Emmon
Cuy
came
bursting
in,
though
it
felt
like
half
the
night.
A
pair
of
men-at-arms
crowded
in
behind
with
torches.
When
they
saw
Renly
in
Brienne’s
arms,
and
her
drenched
with
the
king’s
blood,
Ser
Robar
gave
a
cry
of
horror.
“Wicked
woman!”
screamed
Ser
Emmon,
he
of
the
sunflowered
steel.
“Away
from
him,
you
vile
creature!”

“Gods
be
good,
Brienne,
why?”
asked
Ser
Robar.

Brienne
looked
up
from
her
king’s
body.
The
rainbow
cloak
that
hung
from
her
shoulders
had
turned
red
where
the
king’s
blood
had
soaked
into
the
cloth.
“I…
I…”

“You’ll
die
for
this.”
Ser
Emmon
snatched
up
a
long-handled
battleaxe
from
the
weapons
piled
near
the
door.
“You’ll
pay
for
the
king’s
life
with
your
own!”

“NO!”
Catelyn
Stark
screamed,
finding
her
voice
at
last,
but
it
was
too
late,
the
blood
madness
was
on
them,
and
they
rushed
forward
with
shouts
that
drowned
her
softer
words.

Brienne
moved
faster
than
Catelyn
would
have
believed.
Her
own
sword
was
not
to
hand,
so
she
snatched
Renly’s
from
its
scabbard
and
raised
it
to
catch
Emmon’s
axe
on
the
downswing.
A
spark
flashed
blue-white
as
steel
met
steel
with
a
rending
crash,
and
Brienne
sprang
to
her
feet,
the
body
of
the
dead
king
thrust
rudely
aside.
Ser
Emmon
stumbled
over
it
as
he
tried
to
close,
and
Brienne’s
blade
sheared
through
the
wooden
haft
to
send
his
axehead
spinning.
Another
man
thrust
a
flaming
torch
at
her
back,
but
the
rainbow
cloak
was
too
sodden
with
blood
to
burn.
Brienne
spun
and
cut,
and
torch
and
hand
went
flying.
Flames
crept
across
the
carpet.
The
maimed
man
began
to
scream.
Ser
Emmon
dropped
the
axe
and
fumbled
for
his
sword.
The
second
man-at-arms
lunged,
Brienne
parried,
and
their
swords
danced
and
clanged
against
each
other.
When
Emmon
Cuy
came
wading
back
in,
Brienne
was
forced
to
retreat,
yet
somehow
she
held
them
both
at
bay.
On
the
ground,
Renly’s
head
rolled
sickeningly
to
one
side,
and
a
second
mouth
yawned
wide,
the
blood
coming
from
him
now
in
slow
pulses.

Ser
Robar
had
hung
back,
uncertain,
but
now
he
was
reaching
for
his
hilt.
“Robar,
no,
listen.”
Catelyn
seized
his
arm.
“You
do
her
wrong,
it
was
not
her.
Help
her!
Hear
me,
it
was
Stannis.”
The
name
was
on
her
lips
before
she
could
think
how
it
got
there,
but
as
she
said
it,
she
knew
that
it
was
true.
“I
swear
it,
you
know
me,
it
was
Stannis
killed
him.”

The
young
rainbow
knight
stared
at
this
madwoman
with
pale
and
frightened
eyes.
“Stannis?
How?”

“I
do
not
know.
Sorcery,
some
dark
magic,
there
was
a
shadow,
a
shadow.”
Her
own
voice
sounded
wild
and
crazed
to
her,
but
the
words
poured
out
in
a
rush
as
the
blades
continued
to
clash
behind
her.
“A
shadow
with
a
sword,
I
swear
it,
I
saw.
Are
you
blind,
the
girl
loved
him!
Help
her!”
She
glanced
back,
saw
the
second
guardsman
fall,
his
blade
dropping
from
limp
fingers.
Outside
there
was
shouting.
More
angry
men
would
be
bursting
in
on
them
any
instant,
she
knew.
“She
is
innocent,
Robar.
You
have
my
word,
on
my
husband’s
grave
and
my
honor
as
a
Stark!”

That
resolved
him.
“I
will
hold
them,”
Ser
Robar
said.
“Get
her
away.”
He
turned
and
went
out.

The
fire
had
reached
the
wall
and
was
creeping
up
the
side
of
the
tent.
Ser
Emmon
was
pressing
Brienne
hard,
him
in
his
enameled
yellow
steel
and
her
in
wool.
He
had
forgotten
Catelyn,
until
the
iron
brazier
came
crashing
into
the
back
of
his
head.
Helmed
as
he
was,
the
blow
did
no
lasting
harm,
but
it
sent
him
to
his
knees.
“Brienne,
with
me,”
Catelyn
commanded.
The
girl
was
not
slow
to
see
the
chance.
A
slash,
and
the
green
silk
parted.
They
stepped
out
into
darkness
and
the
chill
of
dawn.
Loud
voices
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
pavilion.
“This
way,”
Catelyn
urged,
“and
slowly.
We
must
not
run,
or
they
will
ask
why.
Walk
easy,
as
if
nothing
were
amiss.”

Brienne
thrust
her
sword
blade
through
her
belt
and
fell
in
beside
Catelyn.
The
night
air
smelled
of
rain.
Behind
them,
the
king’s
pavilion
was
well
ablaze,
flames
rising
high
against
the
dark.
No
one
made
any
move
to
stop
them.
Men
rushed
past
them,
shouting
of
fire
and
murder
and
sorcery.
Others
stood
in
small
groups
and
spoke
in
low
voices.
A
few
were
praying,
and
one
young
squire
was
on
his
knees,
sobbing
openly.

Renly’s
battles
were
already
coming
apart
as
the
rumors
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth.
The
nightfires
had
burned
low,
and
as
the
east
began
to
lighten
the
immense
mass
of
Storm’s
End
emerged
like
a
dream
of
stone
while
wisps
of
pale
mist
raced
across
the
field,
flying
from
the
sun
on
wings
of
wind.
Morning
ghosts,
she
had
heard
Old
Nan
call
them
once,
spirits
returning
to
their
graves.
And
Renly
one
of
them
now,
gone
like
his
brother
Robert,
like
her
own
dear
Ned.

“I
never
held
him
but
as
he
died,”
Brienne
said
quietly
as
they
walked
through
the
spreading
chaos.
Her
voice
sounded
as
if
she
might
break
at
any
instant.
“He
was
laughing
one
moment,
and
suddenly
the
blood
was
everywhere…
my
lady,
I
do
not
understand.
Did
you
see,
did
you…?”

“I
saw
a
shadow.
I
thought
it
was
Renly’s
shadow
at
the
first,
but
it
was
his
brother’s.”

“Lord
Stannis?”

“I
felt
him.
It
makes
no
sense,
I
know…”

It
made
sense
enough
for
Brienne.
“I
will
kill
him,”
the
tall
homely
girl
declared.
“With
my
lord’s
own
sword,
I
will
kill
him.
I
swear
it.
I
swear
it.
I
swear
it.”

Hal
Mollen
and
the
rest
of
her
escort
were
waiting
with
the
horses.
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
was
all
in
a
lather
to
know
what
was
happening.
“My
lady,
the
camp
has
gone
mad,”
he
blurted
when
he
saw
them.
“Lord
Renly,
is
he—”
He
stopped
suddenly,
staring
at
Brienne
and
the
blood
that
drenched
her.

“Dead,
but
not
by
our
hands.”

“The
battle—”
Hal
Mollen
began.

“There
will
be
no
battle.”
Catelyn
mounted,
and
her
escort
formed
up
about
her,
with
Ser
Wendel
to
her
left
and
Ser
Perwyn
Frey
on
her
right.
“Brienne,
we
brought
mounts
enough
for
twice
our
number.
Choose
one,
and
come
with
us.”

“I
have
my
own
horse,
my
lady.
And
my
armor—”

“Leave
them.
We
must
be
well
away
before
they
think
to
look
for
us.
We
were
both
with
the
king
when
he
was
killed.
That
will
not
be
forgotten.”
Wordless,
Brienne
turned
and
did
as
she
was
bid.
“Ride,”
Catelyn
commanded
her
escort
when
they
were
all
ahorse.
“If
any
man
tries
to
stop
us,
cut
him
down.”

As
the
long
fingers
of
dawn
fanned
across
the
fields,
color
was
returning
to
the
world.
Where
grey
men
had
sat
grey
horses
armed
with
shadow
spears,
the
points
of
ten
thousand
lances
now
glinted
silverly
cold,
and
on
the
myriad
flapping
banners
Catelyn
saw
the
blush
of
red
and
pink
and
orange,
the
richness
of
blues
and
browns,
the
blaze
of
gold
and
yellow.
All
the
power
of
Storm’s
End
and
Highgarden,
the
power
that
had
been
Renly’s
an
hour
ago.
They
belong
to
Stannis
now,
she
realized,
even
if
they
do
not
know
it
themselves
yet.
Where
else
are
they
to
turn,
if
not
to
the
last
Baratheon?
Stannis
has
won
all
with
a
single
evil
stroke.

I
am
the
rightful
king,
he
had
declared,
his
jaw
clenched
hard
as
iron,
and
your
son
no
less
a
traitor
than
my
brother
here.
His
day
will
come
as
well.

A
chill
went
through
her.





JON

The
hill
jutted
above
the
dense
tangle
of
forest,
rising
solitary
and
sudden,
its
windswept
heights
visible
from
miles
off.
The
wildlings
called
it
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men,
rangers
said.
It
did
look
like
a
fist,
Jon
Snow
thought,
punching
up
through
earth
and
wood,
its
bare
brown
slopes
knuckled
with
stone.

He
rode
to
the
top
with
Lord
Mormont
and
the
officers,
leaving
Ghost
below
under
the
trees.
The
direwolf
had
run
off
three
times
as
they
climbed,
twice
returning
reluctantly
to
Jon’s
whistle.
The
third
time,
the
Lord
Commander
lost
patience
and
snapped,
“Let
him
go,
boy.
I
want
to
reach
the
crest
before
dusk.
Find
the
wolf
later.”

The
way
up
was
steep
and
stony,
the
summit
crowned
by
a
chest-high
wall
of
tumbled
rocks.
They
had
to
circle
some
distance
west
before
they
found
a
gap
large
enough
to
admit
the
horses.
“This
is
good
ground,
Thoren,”
the
Old
Bear
proclaimed
when
at
last
they
attained
the
top.
“We
could
scarce
hope
for
better.
We’ll
make
our
camp
here
to
await
Halfhand.”
The
Lord
Commander
swung
down
off
his
saddle,
dislodging
the
raven
from
his
shoulder.
Complaining
loudly,
the
bird
took
to
the
air.

The
views
atop
the
hill
were
bracing,
yet
it
was
the
ringwall
that
drew
Jon’s
eye,
the
weathered
grey
stones
with
their
white
patches
of
lichen,
their
beards
of
green
moss.
It
was
said
that
the
Fist
had
been
a
ringfort
=======
“My
lady,
you
should
have
sent
word
of
your
coming,”
Ser
Donnel
Waynwood
told
her
as
their
horses
climbed
the
pass.
“We
would
have
sent
an
escort.
The
high
road
is
not
as
safe
as
it
once
was,
for
a
party
as
small
as
yours.”

“We
learned
that
to
our
sorrow,
Ser
Donnel,”
Catelyn
said.
Sometimes
she
felt
as
though
her
heart
had
turned
to
stone;
six
brave
men
had
died
to
bring
her
this
far,
and
she
could
not
even
find
it
in
her
to
weep
for
them.
Even
their
names
were
fading.
“The
clansmen
harried
us
day
and
night.
We
lost
three
men
in
the
first
attack,
and
two
more
in
the
second,
and
Lannister’s
serving
man
died
of
a
fever
when
his
wounds
festered.
When
we
heard
your
men
approaching,
I
thought
us
doomed
for
certain.”
They
had
drawn
up
for
a
last
desperate
fight,
blades
in
hand
and
backs
to
the
rock.
The
dwarf
had
been
whetting
the
edge
of
his
axe
and
making
some
mordant
jest
when
Bronn
spotted
the
banner
the
riders
carried
before
them,
the
moon-and-falcon
of
House
Arryn,
sky-blue
and
white.
Catelyn
had
never
seen
a
more
welcome
sight.

“The
clans
have
grown
bolder
since
Lord
Jon
died,”
Ser
Donnel
said.
He
was
a
stocky
youth
of
twenty
years,
earnest
and
homely,
with
a
wide
nose
and
a
shock
of
thick
brown
hair.
“If
it
were
up
to
me,
I
would
take
a
hundred
men
into
the
mountains,
root
them
out
of
their
fastnesses,
and
teach
them
some
sharp
lessons,
but
your
sister
has
forbidden
it.
She
would
not
even
permit
her
knights
to
fight
in
the
Hand’s
tourney.
She
wants
all
our
swords
kept
close
to
home,
to
defend
the
Vale…
against
what,
no
one
is
certain.
Shadows,
some
say.”
He
looked
at
her
anxiously,
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
who
she
was.
“I
hope
I
have
not
spoken
out
of
turn,
my
lady.
I
meant
no
offense.”

“Frank
talk
does
not
offend
me,
Ser
Donnel.”
Catelyn
knew
what
her
sister
feared.
Not
shadows,
Lannisters,
she
thought
to
herself,
glancing
back
to
where
the
dwarf
rode
beside
Bronn.
The
two
of
them
had
grown
thick
as
thieves
since
Chiggen
had
died.
The
little
man
was
more
cunning
than
she
liked.
When
they
had
entered
the
mountains,
he
had
been
her
captive,
bound
and
helpless.
What
was
he
now?
Her
captive
still,
yet
he
rode
along
with
a
dirk
through
his
belt
and
an
axe
strapped
to
his
saddle,
wearing
the
shadowskin
cloak
he’d
won
dicing
with
the
singer
and
the
chainmail
hauberk
he’d
taken
off
Chiggen’s
corpse.
Two
score
men
flanked
the
dwarf
and
the
rest
of
her
ragged
band,
knights
and
men-at-arms
in
service
to
her
sister
Lysa
and
Jon
Arryn’s
young
son,
and
yet
Tyrion
betrayed
no
hint
of
fear.
Could
I
be
wrong?
Catelyn
wondered,
not
for
the
first
time.
Could
he
be
innocent
after
all,
of
Bran
and
Jon
Arryn
and
all
the
rest?
And
if
he
was,
what
did
that
make
her?
Six
men
had
died
to
bring
him
here.

Resolute,
she
pushed
her
doubts
away.
“When
we
reach
your
keep,
I
would
take
it
kindly
if
you
could
send
for
Maester
Colemon
at
once.
Ser
Rodrik
is
feverish
from
his
wounds.”
More
than
once
she
had
feared
the
gallant
old
knight
would
not
survive
the
journey.
Toward
the
end
he
could
scarcely
sit
his
horse,
and
Bronn
had
urged
her
to
leave
him
to
his
fate,
but
Catelyn
would
not
hear
of
it.
They
had
tied
him
in
the
saddle
instead,
and
she
had
commanded
Marillion
the
singer
to
watch
over
him.

Ser
Donnel
hesitated
before
he
answered.
“The
Lady
Lysa
has
commanded
the
maester
to
remain
at
the
Eyrie
at
all
times,
to
care
for
Lord
Robert,”
he
said.
“We
have
a
septon
at
the
gate
who
tends
to
our
wounded.
He
can
see
to
your
man’s
hurts.”

Catelyn
had
more
faith
in
a
maester’s
learning
than
a
septon’s
prayers.
She
was
about
to
say
as
much
when
she
saw
the
battlements
ahead,
long
parapets
built
into
the
very
stone
of
the
mountains
on
either
side
of
them.
Where
the
pass
shrank
to
a
narrow
defile
scarce
wide
enough
for
four
men
to
ride
abreast,
twin
watchtowers
clung
to
the
rocky
slopes,
joined
by
a
covered
bridge
of
weathered
grey
stone
that
arched
above
the
road.
Silent
faces
watched
from
arrow
slits
in
tower,
battlements,
and
bridge.
When
they
had
climbed
almost
to
the
top,
a
knight
rode
out
to
meet
them.
His
horse
and
his
armor
were
grey,
but
his
cloak
was
the
rippling
blue-and-red
of
Riverrun,
and
a
shiny
black
fish,
wrought
in
gold
and
obsidian,
pinned
its
folds
against
his
shoulder.
“Who
would
pass
the
Bloody
Gate?”
he
called.

“Ser
Donnel
Waynwood,
with
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
and
her
companions,”
the
young
knight
answered.

The
Knight
of
the
Gate
lifted
his
visor.
“I
thought
the
lady
looked
familiar.
You
are
far
from
home,
little
Cat.”

“And
you,
Uncle,”
she
said,
smiling
despite
all
she
had
been
through.
Hearing
that
hoarse,
smoky
voice
again
took
her
back
twenty
years,
to
the
days
of
her
childhood.

“My
home
is
at
my
back,”
he
said
gruffly.

“Your
home
is
in
my
heart,”
Catelyn
told
him.
“Take
off
your
helm.
I
would
look
on
your
face
again.”

“The
years
have
not
improved
it,
I
fear,”
Brynden
Tully
said,
but
when
he
lifted
off
the
helm,
Catelyn
saw
that
he
lied.
His
features
were
lined
and
weathered,
and
time
had
stolen
the
auburn
from
his
hair
and
left
him
only
grey,
but
the
smile
was
the
same,
and
the
bushy
eyebrows
fat
as
caterpillars,
and
the
laughter
in
his
deep
blue
eyes.
“Did
Lysa
know
you
were
coming?”

“There
was
no
time
to
send
word
ahead,”
Catelyn
told
him.
The
others
were
coming
up
behind
her.
“I
fear
we
ride
before
the
storm,
Uncle.”

“May
we
enter
the
Vale?”
Ser
Donnel
asked.
The
Waynwoods
were
ever
ones
for
ceremony.

“In
the
name
of
Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
Defender
of
the
Vale,
True
Warden
of
the
East,
I
bid
you
enter
freely,
and
charge
you
to
keep
his
peace,”
Ser
Brynden
replied.
“Come.”

And
so
she
rode
behind
him,
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Bloody
Gate
where
a
dozen
armies
had
dashed
themselves
to
pieces
in
the
Age
of
Heroes.
On
the
far
side
of
the
stoneworks,
the
mountains
opened
up
suddenly
upon
a
vista
of
green
fields,
blue
sky,
and
snowcapped
mountains
that
took
her
breath
away.
The
Vale
of
Arryn
bathed
in
the
morning
light.

It
stretched
before
them
to
the
misty
cast,
a
tranquil
land
of
rich
black
soil,
wide
slow-moving
rivers,
and
hundreds
of
small
lakes
that
shone
like
mirrors
in
the
sun,
protected
on
all
sides
by
its
sheltering
peaks.
Wheat
and
corn
and
barley
grew
high
in
its
fields,
and
even
in
Highgarden
the
pumpkins
were
no
larger
nor
the
fruit
any
sweeter
than
here.
They
stood
at
the
western
end
of
the
valley,
where
the
high
road
crested
the
last
pass
and
began
its
winding
descent
to
the
bottomlands
two
miles
below.
The
Vale
was
narrow
here,
no
more
than
a
half
day’s
ride
across,
and
the
northern
mountains
seemed
so
close
that
Catelyn
could
almost
reach
out
and
touch
them.
Looming
over
them
all
was
the
jagged
peak
called
the
Giant’s
Lance,
a
mountain
that
even
mountains
looked
up
to,
its
head
lost
in
icy
mists
three
and
a
half
miles
above
the
valley
floor.
Over
its
massive
western
shoulder
flowed
the
ghost
torrent
of
Alyssa’s
Tears.
Even
from
this
distance,
Catelyn
could
make
out
the
shining
silver
thread,
bright
against
the
dark
stone.

When
her
uncle
saw
that
she
had
stopped,
he
moved
his
horse
closer
and
pointed.
“It’s
there,
beside
Alyssa’s
Tears.
All
you
can
see
from
here
is
a
flash
of
white
every
now
and
then,
if
you
look
hard
and
the
sun
hits
the
walls
just
right.”

Seven
towers,
Ned
had
told
her,
like
white
daggers
thrust
into
the
belly
of
the
sky,
so
high
you
can
stand
on
the
parapets
and
look
down
on
the
clouds.
“How
long
a
ride?”
she
asked.

“We
can
be
at
the
mountain
by
evenfall,”
Uncle
Brynden
said,
“but
the
climb
will
take
another
day.”

Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
spoke
up
from
behind.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
“I
fear
I
can
go
no
farther
today.”
His
face
sagged
beneath
his
ragged,
newgrown
whiskers,
and
he
looked
so
weary
Catelyn
feared
he
might
fall
off
his
horse.

“Nor
should
you,”
she
said.
“You
have
done
all
I
could
have
asked
of
you,
and
a
hundred
times
more.
My
uncle
will
see
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
Eyrie.
Lannister
must
come
with
me,
but
there
is
no
reason
that
you
and
the
others
should
not
rest
here
and
recover
your
strength.”

“We
should
be
honored
to
have
them
to
guest,”
Ser
Donnel
said
with
the
grave
courtesy
of
the
young.
Beside
Ser
Rodrik,
only
Bronn,
Ser
Willis
Wode,
and
Marillion
the
singer
remained
of
the
party
that
had
ridden
with
her
from
the
inn
by
the
crossroads.

“My
lady,”
Marillion
said,
riding
forward.
“I
beg
you
allow
me
to
accompany
you
to
the
Eyrie,
to
see
the
end
of
the
tale
as
I
saw
its
beginnings.”
The
boy
sounded
haggard,
yet
strangely
determined;
he
had
a
fevered
shine
to
his
eyes.

Catelyn
had
never
asked
the
singer
to
ride
with
them;
that
choice
he
had
made
himself,
and
how
he
had
come
to
survive
the
journey
when
so
many
braver
men
lay
dead
and
unburied
behind
them,
she
could
never
say.
Yet
here
he
was,
with
a
scruff
of
beard
that
made
him
look
almost
a
man.
Perhaps
she
owed
him
something
for
having
come
this
far.
“Very
well,”
she
told
him.

“I’ll
come
as
well,”
Bronn
announced.

She
liked
that
less
well.
Without
Bronn
she
would
never
have
reached
the
Vale,
she
knew;
the
sellsword
was
as
fierce
a
fighter
as
she
had
ever
seen,
and
his
sword
had
helped
cut
them
through
to
safety.
Yet
for
all
that,
Catelyn
misliked
the
man.
Courage
he
had,
and
strength,
but
there
was
no
kindness
in
him,
and
little
loyalty.
And
she
had
seen
him
riding
beside
Lannister
far
too
often,
talking
in
low
voices
and
laughing
at
some
private
joke.
She
would
have
preferred
to
separate
him
from
the
dwarf
here
and
now,
but
having
agreed
that
Marillion
might
continue
to
the
Eyrie,
she
could
see
no
gracious
way
to
deny
that
same
right
to
Bronn.
“As
you
wish,”
she
said,
although
she
noted
that
he
had
not
actually
asked
her
permission.

Ser
Willis
Wode
remained
with
Ser
Rodrik,
a
soft-spoken
septon
fussing
over
their
wounds.
Their
horses
were
left
behind
as
well,
poor
ragged
things.
Ser
Donnel
promised
to
send
birds
ahead
to
the
Eyrie
and
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
with
the
word
of
their
coming.
Fresh
mounts
were
brought
forth
from
the
stables,
surefooted
mountain
stock
with
shaggy
coats,
and
within
the
hour
they
set
forth
once
again.
Catelyn
rode
beside
her
uncle
as
they
began
the
descent
to
the
valley
floor.
Behind
came
Bronn,
Tyrion
Lannister,
Marillion,
and
six
of
Brynden’s
men.

Not
until
they
were
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
mountain
path,
well
out
of
earshot
of
the
others,
did
Brynden
Tully
turn
to
her
and
say,
“So,
child.
Tell
me
about
this
storm
of
yours.”

“I
have
not
been
a
child
in
many
years,
Uncle,”
Catelyn
said,
but
she
told
him
nonetheless.
It
took
longer
than
she
would
have
believed
to
tell
it
all,
Lysa’s
letter
and
Bran’s
fall,
the
assassin’s
dagger
and
Littlefinger
and
her
chance
meeting
with
Tyrion
Lannister
in
the
crossroads
inn.

Her
uncle
listened
silently,
heavy
brows
shadowing
his
eyes
as
his
frown
grew
deeper.
Brynden
Tully
had
always
known
how
to
listen…
to
anyone
but
her
father.
He
was
Lord
Hoster’s
brother,
younger
by
five
years,
but
the
two
of
them
had
been
at
war
as
far
back
as
Catelyn
could
remember.
During
one
of
their
louder
quarrels,
when
Catelyn
was
eight,
Lord
Hoster
had
called
Brynden
“the
black
goat
of
the
Tully
flock.”
Laughing,
Brynden
had
pointed
out
that
the
sigil
of
their
house
was
a
leaping
trout,
so
he
ought
to
be
a
black
fish
rather
than
a
black
goat,
and
from
that
day
forward
he
had
taken
it
as
his
personal
emblem.

The
war
had
not
ended
until
the
day
she
and
Lysa
had
been
wed.
It
was
at
their
wedding
feast
that
Brynden
told
his
brother
he
was
leaving
Riverrun
to
serve
Lysa
and
her
new
husband,
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie.
Lord
Hoster
had
not
spoken
his
brother’s
name
since,
from
what
Edmure
told
her
in
his
infrequent
letters.

Nonetheless,
during
all
those
years
of
Catelyn’s
girlhood,
it
had
been
Brynden
the
Blackfish
to
whom
Lord
Hoster’s
children
had
run
with
their
tears
and
their
tales,
when
Father
was
too
busy
and
Mother
too
ill.
Catelyn,
Lysa,
Edmure…
and
yes,
even
Petyr
Baelish,
their
father’s
ward…
he
had
listened
to
them
all
patiently,
as
he
listened
now,
laughing
at
their
triumphs
and
sympathizing
with
their
childish
misfortunes.

When
she
was
done,
her
uncle
remained
silent
for
a
long
time,
as
his
horse
negotiated
the
steep,
rocky
trail.
“Your
father
must
be
told,”
he
said
at
last.
“If
the
Lannisters
should
march,
Winterfell
is
remote
and
the
Vale
walled
up
behind
its
mountains,
but
Riverrun
lies
right
in
their
path.”

“I’d
had
the
same
fear,”
Catelyn
admitted.
“I
shall
ask
Maester
Colemon
to
send
a
bird
when
we
reach
the
Eyrie.”
She
had
other
messages
to
send
as
well;
the
commands
that
Ned
had
given
her
for
his
bannermen,
to
ready
the
defenses
of
the
north.
“What
is
the
mood
in
the
Vale?”
she
asked.

“Angry,”
Brynden
Tully
admitted.
“Lord
Jon
was
much
loved,
and
the
insult
was
keenly
felt
when
the
king
named
Jaime
Lannister
to
an
office
the
Arryns
had
held
for
near
three
hundred
years.
Lysa
has
commanded
us
to
call
her
son
the
True
Warden
of
the
East,
but
no
one
is
fooled.
Nor
is
your
sister
alone
in
wondering
at
the
manner
of
the
Hand’s
death.
None
dare
say
Jon
was
murdered,
not
openly,
but
suspicion
casts
a
long
shadow.”
He
gave
Catelyn
a
look,
his
mouth
tight.
“And
there
is
the
boy.”

“The
boy?
What
of
him?”
She
ducked
her
head
as
they
passed
under
a
low
overhang
of
rock,
and
around
a
sharp
turn.

Her
uncle’s
voice
was
troubled.
“Lord
Robert,”
he
sighed.
“Six
years
old,
sickly,
and
prone
to
weep
if
you
take
his
dolls
away.
Jon
Arryn’s
trueborn
heir,
by
all
the
gods,
yet
there
are
some
who
say
he
is
too
weak
to
sit
his
father’s
seat,
Nestor
Royce
has
been
high
steward
these
past
fourteen
years,
while
Lord
Jon
served
in
King’s
Landing,
and
many
whisper
that
he
should
rule
until
the
boy
comes
of
age.
Others
believe
that
Lysa
must
marry
again,
and
soon.
Already
the
suitors
gather
like
crows
on
a
battlefield.
The
Eyrie
is
full
of
them.”

“I
might
have
expected
that,”
Catelyn
said.
Small
wonder
there;
Lysa
was
still
young,
and
the
kingdom
of
Mountain
and
Vale
made
a
handsome
wedding
gift.
“Will
Lysa
take
another
husband?”

“She
says
yes,
provided
she
finds
a
man
who
suits
her,”
Brynden
Tully
said,
“but
she
has
already
rejected
Lord
Nestor
and
a
dozen
other
suitable
men.
She
swears
that
this
time
she
will
choose
her
lord
husband.”

“You
of
all
people
can
scarce
fault
her
for
that.”

Ser
Brynden
snorted.
“Nor
do
I,
but…
it
seems
to
me
Lysa
is
only
playing
at
courtship.
She
enjoys
the
sport,
but
I
believe
your
sister
intends
to
rule
herself
until
her
boy
is
old
enough
to
be
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
in
truth
as
well
as
name.”

“A
woman
can
rule
as
wisely
as
a
man,”
Catelyn
said.

“The
right
woman
can,”
her
uncle
said
with
a
sideways
glance.
“Make
no
mistake,
Cat.
Lysa
is
not
you.”
He
hesitated
a
moment.
“If
truth
be
told,
I
fear
you
may
not
find
your
sister
as
helpful
as
you
would
like.”

She
was
puzzled.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“The
Lysa
who
came
back
from
King’s
Landing
is
not
the
same
girl
who
went
south
when
her
husband
was
named
Hand.
Those
years
were
hard
for
her.
You
must
know.
Lord
Arryn
was
a
dutiful
husband,
but
their
marriage
was
made
from
politics,
not
passion.”

“As
was
my
own.”

“They
began
the
same,
but
your
ending
has
been
happier
than
your
sister’s.
Two
babes
stillborn,
twice
as
many
miscarriages,
Lord
Arryn’s
death…
Catelyn,
the
gods
gave
Lysa
only
the
one
child,
and
he
is
all
your
sister
lives
for
now,
poor
boy.
Small
wonder
she
fled
rather
than
see
him
handed
over
to
the
Lannisters.
Your
sister
is
afraid,
child,
and
the
Lannisters
are
what
she
fears
most.
She
ran
to
the
Vale,
stealing
away
from
the
Red
Keep
like
a
thief
in
the
night,
and
all
to
snatch
her
son
out
of
the
lion’s
mouth…
and
now
you
have
brought
the
lion
to
her
door.”

“In
chains,”
Catelyn
said.
A
crevasse
yawned
on
her
right,
falling
away
into
darkness.
She
reined
up
her
horse
and
picked
her
way
along
step
by
careful
step.

“Oh?”
Her
uncle
glanced
back,
to
where
Tyrion
Lannister
was
making
his
slow
descent
behind
them.
“I
see
an
axe
on
his
saddle,
a
dirk
at
his
belt,
and
a
sellsword
that
trails
after
him
like
a
hungry
shadow.
Where
are
the
chains,
sweet
one?”

Catelyn
shifted
uneasily
in
her
seat.
“The
dwarf
is
here,
and
not
by
choice.
Chains
or
no,
he
is
my
prisoner.
Lysa
will
want
him
to
answer
for
his
crimes
no
less
than
I.
It
was
her
own
lord
husband
the
Lannisters
murdered,
and
her
own
letter
that
first
warned
us
against
them.”

Brynden
Blackfish
gave
her
a
weary
smile.
“I
hope
you
are
right,
child,”
he
sighed,
in
tones
that
said
she
was
wrong.

The
sun
was
well
to
the
west
by
the
time
the
slope
began
to
flatten
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
horses.
The
road
widened
and
grew
straight,
and
for
the
first
time
Catelyn
noticed
wildflowers
and
grasses
growing.
Once
they
reached
the
valley
floor,
the
going
was
faster
and
they
made
good
time,
cantering
through
verdant
greenwoods
and
sleepy
little
hamlets,
past
orchards
and
golden
wheat
fields,
splashing
across
a
dozen
sunlit
streams.
Her
uncle
sent
a
standard-bearer
ahead
of
them,
a
double
banner
flying
from
his
staff;
the
moon-and-falcon
of
House
Arryn
on
high,
and
below
it
his
own
black
fish.
Farm
wagons
and
merchants’
carts
and
riders
from
lesser
houses
moved
aside
to
let
them
pass.

Even
so,
it
was
full
dark
before
they
reached
the
stout
castle
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
Torches
flickered
atop
its
ramparts,
and
the
horned
moon
danced
upon
the
dark
waters
of
its
moat.
The
drawbridge
was
up
and
the
portcullis
down,
but
Catelyn
saw
lights
burning
in
the
gatehouse
and
spilling
from
the
windows
of
the
square
towers
beyond.

“The
Gates
of
the
Moon,”
her
uncle
said
as
the
party
drew
rein.
His
standard-bearer
rode
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
to
hail
the
men
in
the
gatehouse.
“Lord
Nestor’s
seat.
He
should
be
expecting
us.
Look
up.”

Catelyn
raised
her
eyes,
up
and
up
and
up.
At
first
all
she
saw
was
stone
and
trees,
the
looming
mass
of
the
great
mountain
shrouded
in
night,
as
black
as
a
starless
sky.
Then
she
noticed
the
glow
of
distant
fires
well
above
them;
a
tower
keep,
built
upon
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain,
its
lights
like
orange
eyes
staring
down
from
above.
Above
that
was
another,
higher
and
more
distant,
and
still
higher
a
third,
no
more
than
a
flickering
spark
in
the
sky.
And
finally,
up
where
the
falcons
soared,
a
flash
of
white
in
the
moonlight.
Vertigo
washed
over
her
as
she
stared
upward
at
the
pale
towers,
so
far
above.

“The
Eyrie,”
she
heard
Marillion
murmur,
awed.

The
sharp
voice
of
Tyrion
Lannister
broke
in.
“The
Arryns
must
not
be
overfond
of
company.
If
you’re
planning
to
make
us
climb
that
mountain
in
the
dark,
I’d
rather
you
kill
me
here.”

“We’ll
spend
the
night
here
and
make
the
ascent
on
the
morrow,”
Brynden
told
him.

“I
can
scarcely
wait,”
the
dwarf
replied.
“How
do
we
get
up
there?
I’ve
no
experience
at
riding
goats.”

“Mules,”
Brynden
said,
smiling.

“There
are
steps
carved
into
the
mountain,”
Catelyn
said.
Ned
had
told
her
about
them
when
he
talked
of
his
youth
here
with
Robert
Baratheon
and
Jon
Arryn.

Her
uncle
nodded.
“It
is
too
dark
to
see
them,
but
the
steps
are
there.
Too
steep
and
narrow
for
horses,
but
mules
can
manage
them
most
of
the
way.
The
path
is
guarded
by
three
waycastles,
Stone
and
Snow
and
Sky.
The
mules
will
take
us
as
far
up
as
Sky.”

Tyrion
Lannister
glanced
up
doubtfully.
“And
beyond
that?”

Brynden
smiled.
“Beyond
that,
the
path
is
too
steep
even
for
mules.
We
ascend
on
foot
the
rest
of
the
way.
Or
perchance
you’d
prefer
to
ride
a
basket.
The
Eyrie
clings
to
the
mountain
directly
above
Sky,
and
in
its
cellars
are
six
great
winches
with
long
iron
chains
to
draw
supplies
up
from
below.
If
you
prefer,
my
lord
of
Lannister,
I
can
arrange
for
you
to
ride
up
with
the
bread
and
beer
and
apples.”

The
dwarf
gave
a
bark
of
laughter.
“Would
that
I
were
a
pumpkin,”
he
said.
“Alas,
my
lord
father
would
no
doubt
be
most
chagrined
if
his
son
of
Lannister
went
to
his
fate
like
a
load
of
turnips.
If
you
ascend
on
foot,
I
fear
I
must
do
the
same.
We
Lannisters
do
have
a
certain
pride.”

“Pride?”
Catelyn
snapped.
His
mocking
tone
and
easy
manner
made
her
angry.
“Arrogance,
some
might
call
it.
Arrogance
and
avarice
and
lust
for
power.”

“My
brother
is
undoubtedly
arrogant,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied.
“My
father
is
the
soul
of
avarice,
and
my
sweet
sister
Cersei
lusts
for
power
with
every
waking
breath.
I,
however,
am
innocent
as
a
little
lamb.
Shall
I
bleat
for
you?”
He
grinned.

The
drawbridge
came
creaking
down
before
she
could
reply,
and
they
heard
the
sound
of
oiled
chains
as
the
portcullis
was
drawn
up.
Men-at-arms
carried
burning
brands
out
to
light
their
way,
and
her
uncle
led
them
across
the
moat.
Lord
Nestor
Royce,
High
Steward
of
the
Vale
and
Keeper
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon,
was
waiting
in
the
yard
to
greet
them,
surrounded
by
his
knights.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said,
bowing.
He
was
a
massive,
barrel-chested
man,
and
his
bow
was
clumsy.

Catelyn
dismounted
to
stand
before
him.
“Lord
Nestor,”
she
said.
She
knew
the
man
only
by
reputation;
Bronze
Yohn’s
cousin,
from
a
lesser
branch
of
House
Royce,
yet
still
a
formidable
lord
in
his
own
right.
“We
have
had
a
long
and
tiring
journey.
I
would
beg
the
hospitality
of
your
roof
tonight,
if
I
might.”

“My
roof
is
yours,
my
lady,”
Lord
Nestor
returned
gruffly,
“but
your
sister
the
Lady
Lysa
has
sent
down
word
from
the
Eyrie.
She
wishes
to
see
you
at
once.
The
rest
of
your
party
will
be
housed
here
and
sent
up
at
first
light.”

Her
uncle
swung
off
his
horse.
“What
madness
is
this?”
he
said
bluntly.
Brynden
Tully
had
never
been
a
man
to
blunt
the
edge
of
his
words.
“A
night
ascent,
with
the
moon
not
even
full?
Even
Lysa
should
know
that’s
an
invitation
to
a
broken
neck.”

“The
mules
know
the
way,
Ser
Brynden.”
A
wiry
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
stepped
up
beside
Lord
Nestor.
Her
dark
hair
was
cropped
short
and
straight
around
her
head,
and
she
wore
riding
leathers
and
a
light
shirt
of
silvered
ringmail.
She
bowed
to
Catelyn,
more
gracefully
than
her
lord.
“I
promise
you,
my
lady,
no
harm
will
come
to
you.
It
would
be
my
honor
to
take
you
up.
I’ve
made
the
dark
climb
a
hundred
times.
Mychel
says
my
father
must
have
been
a
goat.”

She
sounded
so
cocky
that
Catelyn
had
to
smile.
“Do
you
have
a
name,
child?”

“Mya
Stone,
if
it
please
you,
my
lady,”
the
girl
said.

It
did
not
please
her;
it
was
an
effort
for
Catelyn
to
keep
the
smile
on
her
face.
Stone
was
a
bastard’s
name
in
the
Vale,
as
Snow
was
in
the
north,
and
Flowers
in
Highgarden;
in
each
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
custom
had
fashioned
a
surname
for
children
born
with
no
names
of
their
own.
Catelyn
had
nothing
against
this
girl,
but
suddenly
she
could
not
help
but
think
of
Ned’s
bastard
on
the
Wall,
and
the
thought
made
her
angry
and
guilty,
both
at
once.
She
struggled
to
find
words
for
a
reply.

Lord
Nestor
filled
the
silence.
“Mya’s
a
clever
girl,
and
if
she
vows
she
will
bring
you
safely
to
the
Lady
Lysa,
I
believe
her.
She
has
not
failed
me
yet.”

“Then
I
put
myself
in
your
hands,
Mya
Stone,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lord
Nestor,
I
charge
you
to
keep
a
close
guard
on
my
prisoner.”

“And
I
charge
you
to
bring
the
prisoner
a
cup
of
wine
and
a
nicely
crisped
capon,
before
he
dies
of
hunger,”
Lannister
said.
“A
girl
would
be
pleasant
as
well,
but
I
suppose
that’s
too
much
to
ask
of
you.”
The
sellsword
Bronn
laughed
aloud.

Lord
Nestor
ignored
the
banter.
“As
you
say,
my
lady,
so
it
will
be
done.”
Only
then
did
he
look
at
the
dwarf.
“See
our
lord
of
Lannister
to
a
tower
cell,
and
bring
him
meat
and
mead.”

Catelyn
took
her
leave
of
her
uncle
and
the
others
as
Tyrion
Lannister
was
led
off,
then
followed
the
bastard
girl
through
the
castle.
Two
mules
were
waiting
in
the
upper
bailey,
saddled
and
ready.
Mya
helped
her
mount
one
while
a
guardsman
in
a
sky-blue
cloak
opened
the
narrow
postern
gate.
Beyond
was
dense
forest
of
pine
and
spruce,
and
the
mountain
like
a
black
wall,
but
the
steps
were
there,
chiseled
deep
into
the
rock,
ascending
into
the
sky.
“Some
people
find
it
easier
if
they
close
their
eyes,”
Mya
said
as
she
led
the
mules
through
the
gate
into
the
dark
wood.
“When
they
get
frightened
or
dizzy,
sometimes
they
hold
on
to
the
mule
too
tight.
They
don’t
like
that.”

“I
was
born
a
Tully
and
wed
to
a
Stark,”
Catelyn
said.
“I
do
not
frighten
easily.
Do
you
plan
to
light
a
torch?”
The
steps
were
black
as
pitch.

The
girl
made
a
face.
“Torches
just
blind
you.
On
a
clear
night
like
this,
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
enough.
Mychel
says
I
have
the
eyes
of
the
owl.”
She
mounted
and
urged
her
mule
up
the
first
step.
Catelyn’s
animal
followed
of
its
own
accord.

“You
mentioned
Mychel
before,”
Catelyn
said.
The
mules
set
the
pace,
slow
but
steady.
She
was
perfectly
content
with
that.

“Mychel’s
my
love,”
Mya
explained.
“Mychel
Redfort.
He’s
squire
to
Ser
Lyn
Corbray.
We’re
to
wed
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
knight,
next
year
or
the
year
after.”

She
sounded
so
like
Sansa,
so
happy
and
innocent
with
her
dreams.
Catelyn
smiled,
but
the
smile
was
tinged
with
sadness.
The
Redforts
were
an
old
name
in
the
Vale,
she
knew,
with
the
blood

Men

the
Dawn
Age.
“An
old
place,
and
strong,”
Thoren
Smallwood
said.

“Old,”
Mormont’s
raven
screamed
as
it
flapped
in
noisy
circles
about
their
heads.
“Old,
old,
old.”

“Quiet,”
Mormont
growled
up
at
the
bird.
The
Old
Bear
was
too
proud
to
admit
to
weakness,
but
Jon
was
not
deceived.
The
strain
of
keeping
up
with
younger
men
was
taking
its
toll.

“These
heights
will
be
easy
to
defend,
if
need
be,”
Thoren
pointed
out
as
he
walked
his
horse
along
the
ring
of
stones,
his
sable-trimmed
cloak
stirring
in
the
wind.

“Yes,
this
place
will
do.”
The
Old
Bear
lifted
a
hand
to
the
wind,
and
raven
landed
on
his
forearm,
claws
scrabbling
against
his
black
ringmail.

“What
about
water,
my
lord?”
Jon
wondered.

“We
crossed
a
brook
at
the
foot
of
the
hill.”

“A
long
climb
for
a
drink,”
Jon
pointed
out,
“and
outside
the
ring
of
stones.”

Thoren
said,
“Are
you
too
lazy
to
climb
a
hill,
boy?”

When
Lord
Mormont
said,
“We’re
not
like
to
find
another
place
as
strong.
We’ll
carry
water,
and
make
certain
we
are
well
supplied,”
Jon
knew
better
than
to
argue.
So
the
command
was
given,
and
the
brothers
of
the
Night’s
Watch
raised
their
camp
behind
the
stone
ring
the
First
Men
had
made.
Black
tents
sprouted
like
mushrooms
after
a
rain,
and
blankets
and
bedrolls
covered
the
bare
ground.
Stewards
tethered
the
garrons
in
long
lines,
and
saw
them
fed
and
watered.
Foresters
took
their
axes
to
the
trees
in
the
waning
afternoon
light
to
harvest
enough
wood
to
see
them
through
the
night.
A
score
of
builders
set
to
clearing
brush,
digging
latrines,
and
untying
their
bundles
of
fire-hardened
stakes.
“I
will
have
every
opening
in
the
ringwall
ditched
and
staked
before
dark,”
the
Old
Bear
had
commanded.

Once
he’d
put
up
the
Lord
Commander’s
tent
and
seen
to
their
horses,
Jon
Snow
descended
the
hill
in
search
of
Ghost.
The
direwolf
came
at
once,
all
in
silence.
One
moment
Jon
was
striding
beneath
the
trees,
whistling
and
shouting,
alone
in
the
green,
pinecones
and
fallen
leaves
under
his
feet;
the
next,
the
great
white
direwolf
was
walking
beside
him,
pale
as
morning
mist.

But
when
they
reached
the
ringfort,
Ghost
balked
again.
He
padded
forward
warily
to
sniff
at
the
gap
in
the
stones,
and
then
retreated,
as
if
he
did
not
like
what
he’d
smelled.
Jon
tried
to
grab
him
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
haul
him
bodily
inside
the
ring,
no
easy
task;
the
wolf
weighed
as
much
as
he
did,
and
was
stronger
by
far.
“Ghost,
what’s
wrong
with
you?”
It
was
not
like
him
to
be
so
unsettled.
In
the
end
Jon
had
to
give
it
up.
“As
you
will,”
he
told
the
wolf.
“Go,
hunt.”
The
red
eyes
watched
him
as
he
made
his
way
back
through
the
mossy
stones.

They
ought
to
be
safe
here.
The
hill
offered
commanding
views,
and
the
slopes
were
precipitous
to
the
north
and
west
and
only
slightly
more
gentle
to
the
east.
Yet
as
the
dusk
deepened
and
darkness
seeped
into
the
hollows
between
the
trees,
Jon’s
sense
of
foreboding
grew.
This
is
the
haunted
forest,
he
told
himself.
Maybe
there
are
ghosts
here,
the
spirits
of
the
First
Men.
This
was
their
place,
once.

“Stop
acting
the
boy,”
he
told
himself.
Clambering
atop
the
piled
rocks,
Jon
gazed
off
toward
the
setting
sun.
He
could
see
the
light
shimmering
like
hammered
gold
off
the
surface
of
the
Milkwater
as
it
curved
away
to
the
south.
Upriver
the
land
was
more
rugged,
the
dense
forest
giving
way
to
a
series
of
bare
stony
hills
that
rose
high
and
wild
to
the
north
and
west.
On
the
horizon
stood
the
mountains
like
a
great
shadow,
range
on
range
of
them
receding
into
the
blue-grey
distance,
their
jagged
peaks
sheathed
eternally
in
snow.
Even
from
afar
they
looked
vast
and
cold
and
inhospitable.

Closer
at
hand,
it
was
the
trees
that
ruled.
To
south
and
east
the
wood
went
on
as
far
as
Jon
could
see,
a
vast
tangle
of
root
and
limb
painted
in
a
thousand
shades
of
green,
with
here
and
there
a
patch
of
red
where
a
weirwood
shouldered
through
the
pines
and
sentinels,
or
a
blush
of
yellow
where
some
broadleafs
had
begun
to
turn.
When
the
wind
blew,
he
could
hear
the
creak
and
groan
of
branches
older
than
he
was.
A
thousand
leaves
fluttered,
and
for
a
moment
the
forest
seemed
a
deep
green
sea,
storm-tossed
and
heaving,
eternal
and
unknowable.

Ghost
was
not
like
to
be
alone
down
there,
he
thought.
Anything
could
be
moving
under
that
sea,
creeping
toward
the
ringfort
through
the
dark
of
the
wood,
concealed
beneath
those
trees.
Anything.
How
would
they
ever
know?
He
stood
there
for
a
long
time,
until
the
sun
vanished
behind
the
saw-toothed
mountains
and
darkness
began
to
creep
through
the
forest.

“Jon?”
Samwell
Tarly
called
up.
“I
thought
it
looked
like
you.
Are
you
well?”

“Well
enough.”
Jon
hopped
down.
“How
did
you
fare
today?”

“Well.
I
fared
well.
Truly.”

Jon
was
not
about
to
share
his
disquiet
with
his
friend,
not
when
Samwell
Tarly
was
at
last
beginning
to
find
his
courage.
“The
Old
Bear
means
to
wait
here
for
Qhorin
Halfhand
and
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower.”

“It
seems
a
strong
place,”
said
Sam.
“A
ringfort
of
the
First
Men.
Do
you
think
there
were
battles
fought
here?”

“No
doubt.
You’d
best
get
a
bird
ready.
Mormont
will
want
to
send
back
word.”

“I
wish
I
could
send
them
all.
They
hate
being
caged.”

“You
would
too,
if
you
could
fly.”

“If
I
could
fly,
I’d
be
back
at
Castle
Black
eating
a
pork
pie,”
said
Sam.

Jon
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
with
his
burned
hand.
They
walked
back
through
the
camp
together.
Cookfires
were
being
lit
all
around
them.
Overhead,
the
stars
were
coming
out.
The
long
red
tail
of
Mormont’s
Torch
burned
as
bright
as
the
moon.
Jon
heard
the
ravens
before
he
saw
them.
Some
were
calling
his
name.
The
birds
were
not
shy
when
it
came
to
making
noise.

They
feel
it
too.
“I’d
best
see
to
the
Old
Bear,”
he
said.
“He
gets
noisy
when
he
isn’t
fed
as
well.”

He
found
Mormont
talking
with
Thoren
Smallwood
and
half
a
dozen
other
officers.
“There
you
are,”
the
old
man
said
gruffly.
“Bring
us
some
hot
wine,
if
you
would.
The
night
is
chilly.”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
Jon
built
a
cookfire,
claimed
a
small
cask
of
Mormont’s
favorite
robust
red
from
stores,
and
poured
it
into
a
kettle.
He
hung
the
kettle
above
the
flames
while
he
gathered
the
rest
of
his
ingredients.
The
Old
Bear
was
particular
about
his
hot
spiced
wine.
So
much
cinnamon
and
so
much
nutmeg
and
so
much
honey,
not
a
drop
more.
Raisins
and
nuts
and
dried
berries,
but
no
lemon,
that
was
the
rankest
sort
of
southron
heresy—which
was
queer,
since
he
always
took
lemon
in
his
morning
beer.
The
drink
must
be
hot
to
warm
a
man
properly,
the
Lord
Commander
insisted,
but
the
wine
must
never
be
allowed
to
come
to
a
boil.
Jon
kept
a
careful
eye
on
the
kettle.

As
he
worked,
he
could
hear
the
voices
from
inside
the
tent.
Jarman
Buckwell
said,
“The
easiest
road
up
into
the
Frostfangs
is
to
follow
the
Milkwater
back
to
its
source.
Yet
if
we
go
that
path,
Rayder
will
know
of
our
approach,
certain
as
sunrise.”

“The
Giant’s
Stair
might
serve,”
said
Ser
Mallador
Locke,
“or
the
Skirling
Pass,
if
it’s
clear.”

The
wine
was
steaming.
Jon
lifted
the
kettle
off
the
fire,
filled
eight
cups,
and
carried
them
into
the
tent.
The
Old
Bear
was
peering
at
the
crude
map
Sam
had
drawn
him
that
night
back
in
Craster’s
Keep.
He
took
a
cup
from
Jon’s
tray,
tried
a
swallow
of
wine,
and
gave
a
brusque
nod
of
approval.
His
raven
hopped
down
his
arm.
“Corn,”
it
said.
“Corn.
Corn.”

Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
waved
the
wine
away.
“I
would
not
go
into
the
mountains
at
all,”
he
said
in
a
thin,
tired
voice.
“The
Frostfangs
have
a
cruel
bite
even
in
summer,
and
now…
if
we
should
be
caught
by
a
storm…”

“I
do
not
mean
to
risk
the
Frostfangs
unless
I
must,”
said
Mormont.
“Wildlings
can
no
more
live
on
snow
and
stone
than
we
can.
They
will
emerge
from
the
heights
soon,
and
for
a
host
of
any
size,
the
only
route
is
along
the
Milkwater.
If
so,
we
are
strongly
placed
here.
They
cannot
hope
to
slip
by
us.”

“They
may
not
wish
to.
They
are
thousands,
and
we
will
be
three
hundred
when
the
Halfhand
reaches
us.”
Ser
Mallador
accepted
a
cup
from
Jon.

“If
it
comes
to
battle,
we
could
not
hope
for
better
ground
than
here,”
declared
Mormont.
“We’ll
strengthen
the
defenses.
Pits
and
spikes,
caltrops
scattered
on
the
slopes,
every
breach
mended.
Jarman,
I’ll
want
your
sharpest
eyes
as
watchers.
A
ring
of
them,
all
around
us
and
along
the
river,
to
warn
of
any
approach.
Hide
them
up
in
trees.
And
we
had
best
start
bringing
up
water
too,
more
than
we
need.
We’ll
dig
cisterns.
It
will
keep
the
men
occupied,
and
may
prove
needful
later.”

“My
rangers—”
started
Thoren
Smallwood.

“Your
rangers
will
limit
their
ranging
to
this
side
of
the
river
until
the
Halfhand
reaches
us.
After
that,
we’ll
see.
I
will
not
lose
more
of
my
men.”

“Mance
Rayder
might
be
massing
his
host
a
day’s
ride
from
here,
and
we’d
never
know,”
Smallwood
complained.

“We
know
where
the
wildlings
are
massing,”
Mormont
came
back.
“We
had
it
from
Craster.
I
mislike
the
man,
but
I
do
not
think
he
lied
to
us
in
this.”

“As
you
say.”
Smallwood
took
a
sullen
leave.
The
others
finished
their
wine
and
followed,
more
courteously.

“Shall
I
bring
you
supper,
my
lord?”
Jon
asked.

“Corn,”
the
raven
cried.
Mormont
did
not
answer
at
once.
When
he
did
he
said
only,
“Did
your
wolf
find
game
today?”

“He’s
not
back
yet.”

“We
could
do
with
fresh
meat.”
Mormont
dug
into
a
sack
and
offered
his
raven
a
handful
of
corn.
“You
think
I’m
wrong
to
keep
the
rangers
close?”

“That’s
not
for
me
to
say,
my
lord.”

“It
is
if
you’re
asked.”

“If
the
rangers
must
stay
in
sight
of
the
Fist,
I
don’t
see
how
they
can
hope
to
find
my
uncle,”
Jon
admitted.

“They
can’t.”
The
raven
pecked
at
the
kernels
in
the
Old
Bear’s
palm.
“Two
hundred
men
or
ten
thousand,
the
country
is
too
vast.”
The
corn
gone,
Mormont
turned
his
hand
over.

“You
would
not
give
up
the
search?”

“Maester
Aemon
thinks
you
clever.”
Mormont
moved
the
raven
to
his
shoulder.
The
bird
tilted
its
head
to
one
side,
little
eyes
a-glitter.

The
answer
was
there.
“Is
it…
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
easier
for
one
man
to
find
two
hundred
than
for
two
hundred
to
find
one.”

The
raven
gave
a
cackling
scream,
but
the
Old
Bear
smiled
through
the
grey
of
his
beard.
“This
many
men
and
horses
leave
a
trail
even
Aemon
could
follow.
On
this
hill,
our
fires
ought
to
be
visible
as
far
off
as
the
foothills
of
the
Frostfangs.
If
Ben
Stark
is
alive
and
free,
he
will
come
to
us,
I
have
no
doubt.”

“Yes,”
said
Jon,
“but…
what
if…”

“…he’s
dead?”
Mormont
asked,
not
unkindly.

Jon
nodded,
reluctantly.

“Dead,”
the
raven
said.
“Dead.
Dead.”

“He
may
come
to
us
anyway,”
the
Old
Bear
said.
“As
Othor
did,
and
Jafer
Flowers.
I
dread
that
as
much
as
you,
Jon,
but
we
must
admit
the
possibility.”

“Dead,”
his
raven
cawed,
ruffling
its
wings.
Its
voice
grew
louder
and
more
shrill.
“Dead.”

Mormont
stroked
the
bird’s
black
feathers,
and
stifled
a
sudden
yawn
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“I
will
forsake
supper,
I
believe.
Rest
will
serve
me
better.
Wake
me
at
first
light.”

“Sleep
well,
my
lord.”
Jon
gathered
up
the
empty
cups
and
stepped
outside.
He
heard
distant
laughter,
the
plaintive
sound
of
pipes.
A
great
blaze
was
crackling
in
the
center
of
the
camp,
and
he
could
smell
stew
cooking.
The
Old
Bear
might
not
be
hungry,
but
Jon
was.
He
drifted
over
toward
the
fire.

Dywen
was
holding
forth,
spoon
in
hand.
“I
know
this
wood
as
well
as
any
man
alive,
and
I
tell
you,
I
wouldn’t
care
to
ride
through
it
alone
tonight.
Can’t
you
smell
it?”

Grenn
was
staring
at
him
with
wide
eyes,
but
Dolorous
Edd
said,
“All
I
smell
is
the
shit
of
two
hundred
horses.
And
this
stew.
Which
has
a
similar
aroma,
now
that
I
come
to
sniff
it.”

“I’ve
got
your
similar
aroma
right
here.”
Hake
patted
his
dirk.
Grumbling,
he
filled
Jon’s
bowl
from
the
kettle.

The
stew
was
thick
with
barley,
carrot,
and
onion,
with
here
and
there
a
ragged
shred
of
salt
beef,
softened
in
the
cooking.

“What
is
it
you
smell,
Dywen?”
asked
Grenn.

The
forester
sucked
on
his
spoon
a
moment.
He
had
taken
out
his
teeth.
His
face
was
leathery
and
wrinkled,
his
hands
gnarled
as
old
roots.
“Seems
to
me
like
it
smells…
well…
cold.”

“Your
head’s
as
wooden
as
your
teeth,”
Hake
told
him.
“There’s
no
smell
to
cold.”

There
is,
thought
Jon,
remembering
the
night
in
the
Lord
Commander’s
chambers.
It
smells
like
death.
Suddenly
he
was
not
hungry
anymore.
He
gave
his
stew
to
Grenn,
who
looked
in
need
of
an
extra
supper
to
warm
him
against
the
night.

The
wind
was
blowing
briskly
when
he
left.
By
morning,
frost
would
cover
the
ground,
and
the
tent
ropes
would
be
stiff
and
frozen.
A
few
fingers
of
spiced
wine
sloshed
in
the
bottom
of
the
kettle.
Jon
fed
fresh
wood
to
the
fire
and
put
the
kettle
over
the
flames
to
reheat.
He
flexed
his
fingers
as
he
waited,
squeezing
and
spreading
until
the
hand
tingled.
The
first
watch
had
taken
up
their
stations
around
the
perimeter
of
the
camp.
Torches
flickered
all
along
the
ringwall.
The
night
was
moonless,
but
a
thousand
stars
shone
overhead.

A
sound
rose
out
of
the
darkness,
faint
and
distant,
but
unmistakable:
the
howling
of
wolves.
Their
voices
rose
and
fell,
a
chilly
song,
and
lonely.
It
made
the
hairs
rise
along
the
back
of
his
neck.
Across
the
fire,
a
pair
of
red
eyes
regarded
him
from
the
shadows.
The
light
of
the
flames
made
them
glow.

“Ghost,”
Jon
breathed,
surprised.
“So
you
came
inside
after
all,
eh?”
The
white
wolf
often
hunted
all
night;
he
had
not
expected
to
see
him
again
till
daybreak.
“Was
the
hunting
so
bad?”
he
asked.
“Here.
To
me,
Ghost.”

The
direwolf
circled
the
fire,
sniffing
Jon,
sniffing
the
wind,
never
still.
It
did
not
seem
as
if
he
were
after
meat
right
now.
When
the
dead
came
walking,
Ghost
knew.
He
woke
me,
warned
me.
Alarmed,
he
got
to
his
feet.
“is
something
out
there?
Ghost,
do
you
have
a
scent?”
Dywen
said
he
smelled
cold.

The
direwolf
loped
off,
stopped,
looked
back.
He
wants
me
to
follow.
Pulling
=======
their
veins.
His
love
she
might
be,
but
no
Redfort
would
ever
wed
a
bastard.
His
family
would
arrange
a
more
suitable
match
for
him,
to
a
Corbray
or
a
Waynwood
or
a
Royce,
or
perhaps
a
daughter
of
some
greater
house
outside
the
Vale.
If
Mychel
Redfort
laid
with
this
girl
at
all,
it
would
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
sheet.

The
ascent
was
easier
than
Catelyn
had
dared
hope.
The
trees
pressed
close,
leaning
over
the
path
to
make
a
rustling
green
roof
that
shut
out
even
the
moon,
so
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
moving
up
a
long
black
tunnel.
But
the
mules
were
surefooted
and
tireless,
and
Mya
Stone
did
indeed
seem
blessed
with
night-eyes.
They
plodded
upward,
winding
their
way
back
and
forth
across
the
face
of
the
mountain
as
the
steps
twisted
and
turned.
A
thick
layer
of
fallen
needles
carpeted
the
path,
so
the
shoes
of
their
mules
made
only
the
softest
sound
on
the
rock.
The
quiet
soothed
her,
and
the
gentle
rocking
motion
set
Catelyn
to
swaying
in
her
saddle.
Before
long
she
was
fighting
sleep.

Perhaps
she
did
doze
for
a
moment,
for
suddenly
a
massive
ironbound
gate
was
looming
before
them.
“Stone,”
Mya
announced
cheerily,
dismounting.
Iron
spikes
were
set
along
the
tops
of
formidable
stone
walls,
and
two
fat
round
towers
overtopped
the
keep.
The
gate
swung
open
at
Mya’s
shout.
Inside,
the
portly
knight
who
commanded
the
waycastle
greeted
Mya
by
name
and
offered
them
skewers
of
charred
meat
and
onions
still
hot
from
the
spit.
Catelyn
had
not
realized
how
hungry
she
was.
She
ate
standing
in
the
yard,
as
stablehands
moved
their
saddles
to
fresh
mules.
The
hot
juices
ran
down
her
chin
and
dripped
onto
her
cloak,
but
she
was
too
famished
to
care.

Then
it
was
up
onto
a
new
mule
and
out
again
into
the
starlight.
The
second
part
of
the
ascent
seemed
more
treacherous
to
Catelyn.
The
trail
was
steeper,
the
steps
more
worn,
and
here
and
there
littered
with
pebbles
and
broken
stone.
Mya
had
to
dismount
a
half-dozen
times
to
move
fallen
rocks
from
their
path.
“You
don’t
want
your
mule
to
break
a
leg
up
here,”
she
said.
Catelyn
was
forced
to
agree.
She
could
feel
the
altitude
more
now.
The
trees
were
sparser
up
here,
and
the
wind
blew
more
vigorously,
sharp
gusts
that
tugged
at
her
clothing
and
pushed
her
hair
into
her
eyes.
From
time
to
time
the
steps
doubled
back
on
themselves,
and
she
could
see
Stone
below
them,
and
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
farther
down,
its
torches
no
brighter
than
candles.

Snow
was
smaller
than
Stone,
a
single
fortified
tower
and
a
timber
keep
and
stable
hidden
behind
a
low
wall
of
unmortared
rock.
Yet
it
nestled
against
the
Giant’s
Lance
in
such
a
way
as
to
command
the
entire
stone
stair
above
the
lower
waycastle.
An
enemy
intent
on
the
Eyrie
would
have
to
fight
his
way
from
Stone
step
by
step,
while
rocks
and
arrows
rained
down
from
Snow
above.
The
commander,
an
anxious
young
knight
with
a
pockmarked
face,
offered
bread
and
cheese
and
the
chance
to
warm
themselves
before
his
fire,
but
Mya
declined.
“We
ought
to
keep
going,
my
lady,”
she
said.
“If
it
please
you.”
Catelyn
nodded.

Again
they
were
given
fresh
mules.
Hers
was
white.
Mya
smiled
when
she
saw
him.
“Whitey’s
a
good
one,
my
lady.
Sure
of
foot,
even
on
ice,
but
you
need
to
be
careful.
He’ll
kick
if
he
doesn’t
like
you.”

The
white
mule
seemed
to
like
Catelyn;
there
was
no
kicking,
thank
the
gods.
There
was
no
ice
either,
and
she
was
grateful
for
that
as
well.
“My
mother
says
that
hundreds
of
years
ago,
this
was
where
the
snow
began,”
Mya
told
her.
“It
was
always
white
above
here,
and
the
ice
never
melted.”
She
shrugged.
“I
can’t
remember
ever
seeing
snow
this
far
down
the
mountain,
but
maybe
it
was
that
way
once,
in
the
olden
times.”

So
young,
Catelyn
thought,
trying
to
remember
if
she
had
ever
been
like
that.
The
girl
had
lived
half
her
life
in
summer,
and
that
was
all
she
knew.
Winter
is
coming,
child,
she
wanted
to
tell
her.
The
words
were
on
her
lips;
she
almost
said
them.
Perhaps
she
was
becoming
a
Stark
at
last.

Above
Snow,
the
wind
was
a
living
thing,
howling
around
them
like
a
wolf
in
the
waste,
then
falling
off
to
nothing
as
if
to
lure
them
into
complacency.
The
stars
seemed
brighter
up
here,
so
close
that
she
could
almost
touch
them,
and
the
horned
moon
was
huge
in
the
clear
black
sky.
As
they
climbed,
Catelyn
found
it
was
better
to
look
up
than
down.
The
steps
were
cracked
and
broken
from
centuries
of
freeze
and
thaw
and
the
tread
of
countless
mules,
and
even
in
the
dark
the
heights
put
her
heart
in
her
throat.
When
they
came
to
a
high
saddle
between
two
spires
of
rock,
Mya
dismounted.
“It’s
best
to
lead
the
mules
over,”
she
said.
“The
wind
can
be
a
little
scary
here,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
climbed
stiffly
from
the
shadows
and
looked
at
the
path
ahead;
twenty
feet
long
and
close
to
three
feet
wide,
but
with
a
precipitous
drop
to
either
side.
She
could
hear
the
wind
shrieking.
Mya
stepped
lightly
out,
her
mule
following
as
calmly
as
if
they
were
crossing
a
bailey.
It
was
her
turn.
Yet
no
sooner
had
she
taken
her
first
step
than
fear
caught
Catelyn
in
its
jaws.
She
could
feel
the
emptiness,
the
vast
black
gulfs
of
air
that
yawned
around
her.
She
stopped,
trembling,
afraid
to
move.
The
wind
screamed
at
her
and
wrenched
at
her
cloak,
trying
to
pull
her
over
the
edge.
Catelyn
edged
her
foot
backward,
the
most
timid
of
steps,
but
the
mule
was
behind
her,
and
she
could
not
retreat.
I
am
going
to
die
here,
she
thought.
She
could
feel
cold
sweat
trickling
down
her
back.

“Lady
Stark,”
Mya
called
across
the
gulf.
The
girl
sounded
a
thousand
leagues
away.
“Are
you
well?”

Catelyn
Tully
Stark
swallowed
what
remained
of
her
pride.
“I…
I
cannot
do
this,
child,”
she
called
out.

“Yes
you
can,”
the
bastard
girl
said.
“I
know
you
can.
Look
how
wide
the
path
is.”

“I
don’t
want
to
look.”
The
world
seemed
to
be
spinning
around
her,
mountain
and
sky
and
mules,
whirling
like
a
child’s
top.
Catelyn
closed
her
eyes
to
steady
her
ragged
breathing.

“I’ll
come
back
for
you,”
Mya
said.
“Don’t
move,
my
lady.”

Moving
was
about
the
last
thing
Catelyn
was
about
to
do.
She
listened
to
the
skirling
of
the
wind
and
the
scuffling
sound
of
leather
on
stone.
Then
Mya
was
there,
taking
her
gently
by
the
arm.
“Keep
your
eyes
closed
if
you
like.
Let
go
of
the
rope
now,
Whitey
will
take
care
of
himself.
Very
good,
my
lady.
I’ll
lead
you
over,
it’s
easy,
you’ll
see.
Give
me
a
step
now.
That’s
it,
move
your
foot,
just
slide
it
forward.
See.
Now
another.
Easy.
You
could
run
across.
Another
one,
go
on.
Yes.”
And
so,
foot
by
foot,
step
by
step,
the
bastard
girl
led
Catelyn
across,
blind
and
trembling,
while
the
white
mule
followed
placidly
behind
them.

The
waycastle
called
Sky
was
no
more
than
a
high,
crescent-shaped
wall
of
unmortared
stone
raised
against
the
side
of
the
mountain,
but
even
the
topless
towers
of
Valyria
could
not
have
looked
more
beautiful
to
Catelyn
Stark.
Here
at
last
the
snow
crown
began;
Sky’s
weathered
stones
were
rimed
with
frost,
and
long
spears
of
ice
hung
from
the
slopes
above.

Dawn
was
breaking
in
the
east
as
Mya
Stone
hallooed
for
the
guards,
and
the
gates
opened
before
them.
Inside
the
walls
there
was
only
a
series
of
ramps
and
a
great
tumble
of
boulders
and
stones
of
all
sizes.
No
doubt
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
begin
an
avalanche
from
here.
A
mouth
yawned
in
the
rock
face
in
front
of
them.
“The
stables
and
barracks
are
in
there,”
Mya
said.
“The
last
part
is
inside
the
mountain.
It
can
be
a
little
dark,
but
at
least
you’re
out
of
the
wind.
This
is
as
far
as
the
mules
can
go.
Past
here,
well,
it’s
a
sort
of
chimney,
more
like
a
stone
ladder
than
proper
steps,
but
it’s
not
too
bad.
Another
hour
and
we’ll
be
there.”

Catelyn
looked
up.
Directly
overhead,
pale
in
the
dawn
light,
she
could
see
the
foundations
of
the
Eyrie.
It
could
not
be
more
than
six
hundred
feet
above
them.
From
below
it
looked
like
a
small
white
honeycomb.
She
remembered
what
her
uncle
had
said
of
baskets
and
winches.
“The
Lannisters
may
have
their
pride,”
she
told
Mya,
“but
the
Tullys
are
born
with
better
sense.
I
have
ridden
all
day
and
the
best
part
of
a
night.
Tell
them
to
lower
a
basket.
I
shall
ride
with
the
turnips.”

The
sun
was
well
above
the
mountains
by
the
time
Catelyn
Stark
finally
reached
the
Eyrie.
A
stocky,
silver-haired
man
in
a
sky-blue
cloak
and
hammered
moon-and-falcon
breastplate
helped
her
from
the
basket;
Ser
Vardis
Egen,
captain
of
Jon
Arryn’s
household
guard.
Beside
him
stood
Maester
Colemon,
thin
and
nervous,
with
too
little
hair
and
too
much
neck.
“Lady
Stark,”
Ser
Vardis
said,
“the
pleasure
is
as
great
as
it
is
unanticipated.”
Maester
Colemon
bobbed
his
head
in
agreement.
“Indeed
it
is,
my
lady,
indeed
it
is.
I
have
sent
word
to
your
sister.
She
left
orders
to
be
awakened
the
instant
you
arrived.”

“I
hope
she
had
a
good
night’s
rest,”
Catelyn
said
with
a
certain
bite
in
her
tone
that
seemed
to
go
unnoticed.

The
men
escorted
her
from
the
winch
room
up
a
spiral
stair.
The
Eyrie
was
a
small
castle
by
the
standards
of
the
great
houses;
seven
slender
white
towers
bunched
as
tightly
as
arrows
in
a
quiver
on
a
shoulder
of
the
great
mountain.
It
had
no
need
of
stables
nor
smithys
nor
kennels,
but
Ned
said
its
granary
was
as
large
as
Winterfell’s,
and
its
towers
could
house
five
hundred
men.
Yet
it
seemed
strangely
deserted
to
Catelyn
as
she
passed
through
it,
its
pale
stone
halls
echoing
and
empty.

Lysa
was
waiting
alone
in
her
solar,
still
clad
in
her
bed
robes.
Her
long
auburn
hair
tumbled
unbound
across
bare
white
shoulders
and
down
her
back.
A
maid
stood
behind
her,
brushing
out
the
night’s
tangles,
but
when
Catelyn
entered,
her
sister
rose
to
her
feet,
smiling.
“Cat,”
she
said.
“Oh,
Cat,
how
good
it
is
to
see
you.
My
sweet
sister.”
She
ran
across
the
chamber
and
wrapped
her
sister
in
her
arms.
“How
long
it
has
been,”
Lysa
murmured
against
her.
“Oh,
how
very
very
long.”

It
had
been
five
years,
in
truth;
five
cruel
years,
for
Lysa.
They
had
taken
their
toll.
Her
sister
was
two
years
the
younger,
yet
she
looked
older
now.
Shorter
than
Catelyn,
Lysa
had
grown
thick
of
body,
pale
and
puffy
of
face.
She
had
the
blue
eyes
of
the
Tullys,
but
hers
were
pale
and
watery,
never
still.
Her
small
mouth
had
turned
petulant.
As
Catelyn
held
her,
she
remembered
the
slender,
high-breasted
girl
who’d
waited
beside
her
that
day
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun.
How
lovely
and
full
of
hope
she
had
been.
All
that
remained
of
her
sister’s
beauty
was
the
great
fall
of
thick
auburn
hair
that
cascaded
to
her
waist.

“You
look
well,”
Catelyn
lied,
“but…
tired.”

Her
sister
broke
the
embrace.
“Tired.
Yes.
Oh,
yes.”
She
seemed
to
notice
the
others
then;
her
maid,
Maester
Colemon,
Ser
Vardis.
“Leave
us,”
she
told
them.
“I
wish
to
speak
to
my
sister
alone.”
She
held
Catelyn’s
hand
as
they
withdrew…

…
and
dropped
it
the
instant
the
door
closed.
Catelyn
saw
her
face
change.
It
was
as
if
the
sun
had
gone
behind
a
cloud.
“Have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses?”
Lysa
snapped
at
her.
“To
bring
him
here,
without
a
word
of
permission,
without
so
much
as
a
warning,
to
drag
us
into
your
quarrels
with
the
Lannisters…”

“My
quarrels?”
Catelyn
could
scarce
believe
what
she
was
hearing.
A
great
fire
burned
in
the
hearth,
but
there
was
no
trace
of
warmth
in
Lysa’s
voice.
“They
were
your
quarrels
first,
sister.
It
was
you
who
sent
me
that
cursed
letter,
you
who
wrote
that
the
Lannisters
had
murdered
your
husband.”

“To
warn
you,
so
you
could
stay
away
from
them!
I
never
meant
to
fight
them!
Gods,
Cat,
do
you
know
what
you’ve
done?”

“Mother?”
a
small
voice
said.
Lysa
whirled,
her
heavy
robe
swirling
around
her.
Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
stood
in
the
doorway,
clutching
a
ragged
cloth
doll
and
looking
at
them
with
large
eyes.
He
was
a
painfully
thin
child,
small
for
his
age
and
sickly
all
his
days,
and
from
time
to
time
he
trembled.
The
shaking
sickness,
the
maesters
called
it.
“I
heard
voices.”

Small
wonder,
Catelyn
thought;
Lysa
had
almost
been
shouting.
Still,
her
sister
looked
daggers
at
her.
“This
is
your
aunt
Catelyn,
baby.
My
sister,
Lady
Stark.
Do
you
remember?”

The
boy
glanced
at
her
blankly.
“I
think
so,”
he
said,
blinking,
though
he
had
been
less
than
a
year
old
the
last
time
Catelyn
had
seen
him.

Lysa
seated
herself
near
the
fire
and
said,
“Come
to
Mother,
my
sweet
one.”
She
straightened
his
bedclothes
and
fussed
with
his
fine
brown
hair.
“Isn’t
he
beautiful?
And
strong
too,
don’t
you
believe
the
things
you
hear.
Jon
knew.
The
seed
is
strong,
he
told
me.
His
last
words.
He
kept
saying
Robert’s
name,
and
he
grabbed
my
arm
so
hard
he
left
marks.
Tell
them,
the
seed
is
strong.
His
seed.
He
wanted
everyone
to
know
what
a
good
strong
boy
my
baby
was
going
to
be.”

“Lysa,”
Catelyn
said,
“if
you’re
right
about
the
Lannisters,
all
the
more
reason
we
must
act
quickly.
We—”

“Not
in
front
of
the
baby,”
Lysa
said.
“He
has
a
delicate
temper,
don’t
you,
sweet
one?”

“The
boy
is
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale,”
Catelyn
reminded
her,
“and
these
are
no
times
for
delicacy.
Ned
thinks
it
may
come
to
war.”

“Quiet!”
Lysa
snapped
at
her.
“You’re
scaring
the
boy.”
Little
Robert
took
a
quick
peek
over
his
shoulder
at
Catelyn
and
began
to
tremble.
His
doll
fell
to
the
rushes,
and
he
pressed
himself
against
his
mother.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
my
sweet
baby,”
Lysa
whispered.
“Mother’s
here,
nothing
will
hurt
you.”
She
opened
her
robe
and
drew
out
a
pale,
heavy
breast,
tipped
with
red.
The
boy
grabbed
for
it
eagerly,
buried
his
face
against
her
chest,
and
began
to
suck.
Lysa
stroked
his
hair.

Catelyn
was
at
a
loss
for
words.
Jon
Arryn’s
son,
she
thought
incredulously.
She
remembered
her
own
baby,
three-year-old
Rickon,
half
the
age
of
this
boy
and
five
times
as
fierce.
Small
wonder
the
lords
of
the
Vale
were
restive.
For
the
first
time
she
understood
why
the
king
had
tried
to
take
the
child
away
from
his
mother
to
foster
with
the
Lannisters…

“We’re
safe
here,”
Lysa
was
saying.
Whether
to
her
or
to
the
boy,
Catelyn
was
not
sure.

“Don’t
be
a
fool,”
Catelyn
said,
the
anger
rising
in
her.
“No
one
is
safe.
If
you
think
hiding
here
will
make
the
Lannisters
forget
you,
you
are
sadly
mistaken.”

Lysa
covered
her
boy’s
ear
with
her
hand.
“Even
if
they
could
bring
an
army
through
the
mountains
and
past
the
Bloody
Gate,
the
Eyrie
is
impregnable.
You
saw
for
yourself.
No
enemy
could
ever
reach
us
up
here.”

Catelyn
wanted
to
slap
her.
Uncle
Brynden
had
tried
to
warn
her,
she
realized.
“No
castle
is
impregnable.”

“This
one
is,”
Lysa
insisted.
“Everyone
says
so.
The
only
thing
is,
what
am
I
to
do
with
this
Imp
you
have
brought
me?”

“Is
he
a
bad
man?”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
asked,
his
mother’s
breast
popping
from
his
mouth,
the
nipple
wet
and
red.

“A
very
bad
man,”
Lysa
told
him
as
she
covered
herself,
“but
Mother
won’t
let
him
harm
my
little
baby.”

“Make
him
fly,”
Robert
said
eagerly.

Lysa
stroked
her
son’s
hair.
“Perhaps
we
will,”
she
murmured.
“Perhaps
that
is
just
what
we
will
do.”





EDDARD

He
found
Littlefinger
in
the
brothel’s
common
room,
chatting
amiably
with
a
tall,
elegant
woman
who
wore
a
feathered
gown
over
skin
as
black
as
ink.
By
the
hearth,
Heward
and
a
buxom
wench
were
playing
at
forfeits.
From
the
look
of
it,
he’d
lost
his
belt,
his
cloak,
his
mail
shirt,
and
his
right
boot
so
far,
while
the
girl
had
been
forced
to
unbutton
her
shift
to
the
waist.
Jory
Cassel
stood
beside
a
rain-streaked
window
with
a
wry
smile
on
his
face,
watching
Heward
turn
over
tiles
and
enjoying
the
view.

Ned
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
pulled
on
his
gloves.
“It’s
time
we
took
our
leave.
My
business
here
is
done.”

Heward
lurched
to
his
feet,
hurriedly
gathering
up
his
things.
“As
you
will,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.
“I’ll
help
Wyl
bring
round
the
horses.”
He
strode
to
the
door.

Littlefinger
took
his
time
saying
his
farewells.
He
kissed
the
black
woman’s
hand,
whispered
some
joke
that
made
her
laugh
aloud,
and
sauntered
over
to
Ned.
“Your
business,”
he
said
lightly,
“or
Robert’s?
They
say
the
Hand
dreams
the
king’s
dreams,
speaks
with
the
king’s
voice,
and
rules
with
the
king’s
sword.
Does
that
also
mean
you
fuck
with
the
king’s—”

“Lord
Baelish,”
Ned
interrupted,
“you
presume
too
much.
I
am
not
ungrateful
for
your
help.
It
might
have
taken
us
years
to
find
this
brothel
without
you.
That
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
endure
your
mockery.
And
I
am
no
longer
the
King’s
Hand.”

“The
direwolf
must
be
a
prickly
beast,”
said
Littlefinger
with
a
sharp
twist
of
his
mouth.

A
warm
rain
was
pelting
down
from
a
starless
black
sky
as
they
walked
to
the
stables.
Ned
drew
>>>>>>> asd
up
the
hood
of
his
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
cloak,
Jon
walked
away
from
the
tents,
away
from
the
warmth
of
his
fire,
past
the
lines
of
shaggy
little
garrons.
One
of
the
horses
whickered
nervously
when
Ghost
padded
by.
Jon
soothed
him
with
a
word
and
paused
to
stroke
his
muzzle.
He
could
hear
the
wind
whistling
through
cracks
in
the
rocks
as
they
neared
the
ringwall.
A
voice
called
out
a
challenge.
Jon
stepped
into
the
torchlight.
“I
need
to
fetch
water
for
the
Lord
Commander.”

“Go
on,
then,”
the
guard
said.
“Be
quick
about
it.”
Huddled
beneath
his
black
cloak,
with
his
hood
drawn
up
against
the
wind,
the
man
never
even
looked
to
see
if
he
had
a
bucket.

Jon
slipped
sideways
between
two
sharpened
stakes
while
Ghost
slid
beneath
them.
A
torch
had
been
thrust
down
into
a
crevice,
its
flames
flying
pale
orange
banners
when
the
gusts
came.
He
snatched
it
up
as
he
squeezed
through
the
gap
between
the
stones.
Ghost
went
racing
down
the
hill.
Jon
followed
more
slowly,
the
torch
thrust
out
before
him
as
he
made
his
descent.
The
camp
sounds
faded
behind
him.
The
night
was
black,
the
slope
steep,
stony,
and
uneven.
A
moment’s
inattention
would
be
a
sure
way
to
break
an
ankle…
or
his
neck.
What
am
I
doing?
he
asked
himself
as
he
picked
his
way
down.

The
trees
stood
beneath
him,
warriors
armored
in
bark
and
leaf,
deployed
in
their
silent
ranks
awaiting
the
command
to
storm
the
hill.
Black,
they
seemed…
it
was
only
when
his
torchlight
brushed
against
them
that
Jon
glimpsed
a
flash
of
green.
Faintly,
he
heard
the
sound
of
water
flowing
over
rocks.
Ghost
vanished
in
the
underbrush.
Jon
struggled
after
him,
listening
to
the
call
of
the
brook,
to
the
leaves
sighing
in
the
wind.
Branches
clutched
at
his
cloak,
while
overhead
thick
limbs
twined
together
and
shut
out
the
stars.

He
found
Ghost
lapping
from
the
stream.
“Ghost,”
he
called,
“to
me.
Now.”
When
the
direwolf
raised
his
head,
his
eyes
glowed
red
and
baleful,
and
water
streamed
down
from
his
jaws
like
slaver.
There
was
something
fierce
and
terrible
about
him
in
that
instant.
And
then
he
was
off,
bounding
past
Jon,
racing
through
the
trees.
“Ghost,
no,
stay,”
he
shouted,
but
the
wolf
paid
no
heed.
The
lean
white
shape
was
swallowed
by
the
dark,
and
Jon
had
only
two
choices—to
climb
the
hill
again,
alone,
or
to
follow.

He
followed,
angry,
holding
the
torch
out
low
so
he
could
see
the
rocks
that
threatened
to
trip
him
with
every
step,
the
thick
roots
that
seemed
to
grab
as
his
feet,
the
holes
where
a
man
could
twist
an
ankle.
Every
few
feet
he
called
again
for
Ghost,
but
the
night
wind
was
swirling
amongst
the
trees
and
it
drank
the
words.
This
is
madness,
he
thought
as
he
plunged
deeper
into
the
trees.
He
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
glimpsed
a
flash
of
white
off
ahead
and
to
the
right,
back
toward
the
hill.
He
jogged
after
it,
cursing
under
his
breath.

A
quarter
way
around
the
Fist
he
chased
the
wolf
before
he
lost
him
again.
Finally
he
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
amidst
the
scrub,
thorns,
and
tumbled
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
hill.
Beyond
the
torchlight,
the
dark
pressed
close.

A
soft
scrabbling
noise
made
him
turn.
Jon
moved
toward
the
sound,
stepping
carefully
among
boulders
and
thornbushes.
Behind
a
fallen
tree,
he
came
on
Ghost
again.
The
direwolf
was
digging
furiously,
kicking
up
dirt.

“What
have
you
found?”
Jon
lowered
the
torch,
revealing
a
rounded
mound
of
soft
earth.
A
grave,
he
thought.
But
whose?

He
knelt,
jammed
the
torch
into
the
ground
beside
him.
The
soil
was
loose,
sandy.
Jon
pulled
it
out
by
the
fistful.
There
were
no
stones,
no
roots.
Whatever
was
here
had
been
put
here
recently.
Two
feet
down,
his
fingers
touched
cloth.
He
had
been
expecting
a
corpse,
fearing
a
corpse,
but
this
was
something
else.
He
pushed
against
the
fabric
and
felt
small,
hard
shapes
beneath,
unyielding.
There
was
no
smell,
no
sign
of
graveworms.
Ghost
backed
off
and
sat
on
his
haunches,
watching.

Jon
brushed
the
loose
soil
away
to
reveal
a
rounded
bundle
perhaps
two
feet
across.
He
jammed
his
fingers
down
around
the
edges
and
worked
it
loose.
When
he
pulled
it
free,
whatever
was
inside
shifted
and
clinked.
Treasure,
he
thought,
but
the
shapes
were
wrong
to
be
coins,
and
the
sound
was
wrong
for
metal.

A
length
of
frayed
rope
bound
the
bundle
together.
Jon
unsheathed
his
dagger
and
cut
it,
groped
for
the
edges
of
the
cloth,
and
pulled.
The
bundle
turned,
and
its
contents
spilled
out
onto
the
ground,
glittering
dark
and
bright.
He
saw
a
dozen
knives,
leaf-shaped
spearheads,
numerous
arrowheads.
Jon
picked
up
a
dagger
blade,
featherlight
and
shiny
black,
hiltless.
Torchlight
ran
along
its
edge,
a
thin
orange
line
that
spoke
of
razor
sharpness.
Dragonglass.
What
the
maesters
call
obsidian.
Had
Ghost
uncovered
some
ancient
cache
of
the
children
of
the
forest,
buried
here
for
thousands
of
years?
The
Fist
of
the
First
Men
was
an
old
place,
only…

Beneath
the
dragonglass
was
an
old
warhorn,
made
from
an
auroch’s
horn
and
banded
in
bronze.
Jon
shook
the
dirt
from
inside
it,
and
a
stream
of
arrowheads
fell
out.
He
let
them
fall,
and
pulled
up
a
corner
of
the
cloth
the
weapons
had
been
wrapped
in,
rubbing
it
between
his
fingers.
Good
wool,
thick,
a
double
weave,
damp
but
not
rotted.
It
could
not
have
been
long
in
the
ground.
And
it
was
dark.
He
seized
a
handful
and
pulled
it
close
to
the
torch.
Not
dark.
Black.

Even
before
Jon
stood
and
shook
it
out,
he
knew
what
he
had:
the
black
cloak
of
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.





BRAN

Alebelly
found
him
in
the
forge,
working
the
bellows
for
Mikken.
“Maester
wants
you
in
the
turret,
m’lord
prince.
There’s
been
a
bird
from
the
king.”

“From
Robb?”
Excited,
Bran
did
not
wait
for
Hodor,
but
let
Alebelly
carry
him
up
the
steps.
He
was
a
big
man,
though
not
so
big
as
Hodor
and
nowhere
near
as
strong.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
maester’s
turret
he
was
red-faced
and
puffing.
Rickon
was
there
before
them,
and
both
Walder
Freys
as
well.

Maester
Luwin
sent
Alebelly
away
and
closed
his
door.
“My
lords,”
he
said
gravely,
“we
have
had
a
message
from
His
Grace,
with
both
good
news
and
ill.
He
has
won
a
great
victory
in
the
west,
shattering
a
Lannister
army
at
a
place
named
Oxcross,
and
has
taken
several
castles
as
well.
He
writes
us
from
Ashemark,
formerly
the
stronghold
of
House
Marbrand.”

Rickon
tugged
at
the
maester’s
robe.
“Is
Robb
coming
home?”

“Not
just
yet,
I
fear.
There
are
battles
yet
to
fight.”

“Was
it
Lord
Tywin
he
defeated?”
asked
Bran.

“No,”
said
the
maester.
“Ser
Stafford
Lannister
commanded
the
enemy
host.
He
was
slain
in
the
battle.”

Bran
had
never
even
heard
of
Ser
Stafford
Lannister.
He
found
himself
agreeing
with
Big
Walder
when
he
said,
“Lord
Tywin
is
the
only
one
who
matters.”

“Tell
Robb
I
want
him
to
come
home,”
said
Rickon.
“He
can
bring
his
wolf
home
too,
and
Mother
and
Father.”
Though
he
knew
Lord
Eddard
was
dead,
sometimes
Rickon
forgot…
willfully,
Bran
suspected.
His
little
brother
was
stubborn
as
only
a
boy
of
four
can
be.

Bran
was
glad
for
Robb’s
victory,
but
disquieted
as
well.
He
remembered
what
Osha
had
said
the
day
that
his
brother
had
led
his
army
out
Of
Winterfell.
He’s
marching
the
wrong
way,
the
wildling
woman
had
insisted.

“Sadly,
no
victory
is
without
cost.”
Maester
Luwin
turned
to
the
Walders.
“My
lords,
your
uncle
Ser
Stevron
Frey
was
among
those
who
lost
their
lives
at
Oxcross.
He
took
a
wound
in
the
battle,
Robb
writes.
It
was
not
thought
to
be
serious,
but
three
days
later
he
died
in
his
tent,
asleep.”

Big
Walder
shrugged.
“He
was
very
old.
Five-and-sixty,
I
think.
Too
old
for
battles.
He
was
always
saying
he
was
tired.”

Little
Walder
hooted.
“Tired
of
waiting
for
our
grandfather
to
die,
you
mean.
Does
this
mean
Ser
Emmon’s
the
heir
now?”

“Don’t
be
stupid,”
his
cousin
said.
“The
sons
of
the
first
son
come
before
the
second
son.
Ser
Ryman
is
next
in
line,
and
then
Edwyn
and
Black
Walder
and
Petyr
Pimple.
And
then
Aegon
and
all
his
sons.”

“Ryman
is
old
too,”
said
Little
Walder.
“Past
forty,
I
bet.
And
he
has
a
bad
belly.
Do
you
think
he’ll
be
lord?”

“I’ll
be
lord.
I
don’t
care
if
he
is.”

Maester
Luwin
cut
in
sharply.
“You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
such
talk,
my
lords.
Where
is
your
grief?
Your
uncle
is
dead.”

“Yes,”
said
Little
Walder.
“We’re
very
sad.”

They
weren’t,
though.
Bran
got
a
sick
feeling
in
his
belly.
They
like
the
taste
of
this
dish
better
than
I
do.
He
asked
Maester
Luwin
to
be
excused.

“Very
well.”
The
maester
rang
for
help.
Hodor
must
have
been
busy
in
the
stables.
It
was
Osha
who
came.
She
was
stronger
than
Alebelly,
though,
and
had
no
trouble
lifting
Bran
in
her
arms
and
carrying
him
down
the
steps.

“Osha,”
Bran
asked
as
they
crossed
the
yard.
“Do
you
know
the
way
north?
To
the
Wall
and…
and
even
past?”

“The
way’s
easy.
Look
for
the
Ice
Dragon,
and
chase
the
blue
star
in
the
rider’s
eye.”
She
backed
through
a
door
and
started
up
the
winding
steps.

“And
there
are
still
giants
there,
and…
the
rest…
the
Others,
and
the
children
of
the
forest
too?”

“The
giants
I’ve
seen,
the
children
I’ve
heard
tell
of,
and
the
white
walkers…
why
do
you
want
to
know?”

“Did
you
ever
see
a
three-eyed
crow?”

“No.”
She
laughed.
“And
I
can’t
say
I’d
want
to.”
Osha
kicked
open
the
door
to
his
bedchamber
and
set
him
in
his
window
seat,
where
he
could
watch
the
yard
below.

It
seemed
only
a
few
heartbeats
after
she
took
her
leave
that
the
door
opened
again,
and
Jojen
Reed
entered
unbidden,
with
his
sister
Meera
behind
him.
“You
heard
about
the
bird?”
Bran
asked.
The
other
boy
nodded.
“It
wasn’t
a
supper
like
you
said.
It
was
a
letter
from
Robb,
and
we
didn’t
eat
it,
but—”

“The
green
dreams
take
strange
shapes
sometimes,”
Jojen
admitted.
“The
truth
of
them
is
not
always
easy
to
understand.”

“Tell
me
the
bad
thing
you
dreamed,”
Bran
said.
“The
bad
thing
that
is
coming
to
Winterfell.”

“Does
my
lord
prince
believe
me
now?
Will
he
trust
my
words,
no
matter
how
queer
they
sound
in
his
ears?”

Bran
nodded.

“It
is
the
sea
that
comes.”

“The
sea?”

“I
dreamed
that
the
sea
was
lapping
all
around
Winterfell.
I
saw
black
waves
crashing
against
the
gates
and
towers,
and
then
the
salt
water
came
flowing
over
the
walls
and
filled
the
castle.
Drowned
men
were
floating
in
the
yard.
When
I
first
dreamed
the
dream,
back
at
Greywater,
I
didn’t
know
their
faces,
but
now
I
do.
That
Alebelly
is
one,
the
guard
who
called
our
names
at
the
feast.
Your
septon’s
another.
Your
smith
as
well.”

“Mikken?”
Bran
was
as
confused
as
he
was
dismayed.
“But
the
sea
is
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
leagues
away,
and
Winterfell’s
walls
are
so
high
the
water
couldn’t
get
in
even
if
it
did
come.”

“In
the
dark
of
night
the
salt
sea
will
flow
over
these
walls,”
said
Jojen.
“I
saw
the
dead,
bloated
and
drowned.”

“We
have
to
tell
them,”
Bran
said.
“Alebelly
and
Mikken,
and
Septon
Chayle.
Tell
them
not
to
drown.”

“It
will
not
save
them,”
replied
the
boy
in
green.

Meera
came
to
the
window
seat
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder.
“They
will
not
believe,
Bran.
No
more
than
you
did.”

Jojen
sat
on
Bran’s
bed.
“Tell
me
what
you
dream.”

He
was
scared,
even
then,
but
he
had
sworn
to
trust
them,
and
a
Stark
of
Winterfell
keeps
his
sworn
word.
“There’s
different
kinds,”
he
said
slowly.
“There’s
the
wolf
dreams,
those
aren’t
so
bad
as
the
others.
I
run
and
hunt
and
kill
squirrels.
And
there’s
dreams
where
the
crow
comes
and
tells
me
to
fly.
Sometimes
the
tree
is
in
those
dreams
too,
calling
my
name.
That
frightens
me.
But
the
worst
dreams
are
when
I
fall.”
He
looked
down
into
the
yard,
feeling
miserable.
“I
never
used
to
fall
before.
When
I
climbed.
I
went
everyplace,
up
on
the
roofs
and
along
the
walls,
I
used
to
feed
the
crows
in
the
Burned
Tower.
Mother
was
afraid
that
I
would
fall
but
I
knew
I
never
would.
Only
I
did,
and
now
when
I
sleep
I
fall
all
the
time.”

Meera
gave
his
shoulder
a
squeeze.
“Is
that
all?”

“I
guess.”

“Warg,”
said
Jojen
Reed.

Bran
looked
at
him,
his
eyes
wide.
“What?”

“Warg.
Shapechanger.
Beastling.
That
is
what
they
will
call
you,
if
they
should
ever
hear
of
your
wolf
dreams.”

The
names
made
him
afraid
again.
“Who
will
call
me?”

“Your
own
folk.
In
fear.
Some
will
hate
you
if
they
know
what
you
are.
Some
will
even
try
to
kill
you.”

Old
Nan
told
scary
stories
of
beastlings
and
shapechangers
sometimes.
In
the
stories
they
were
always
evil.
“I’m
not
like
that,”
Bran
said.
“I’m
not.
It’s
only
dreams.”

“The
wolf
dreams
are
no
true
dreams.
You
have
your
eye
closed
tight
whenever
you’re
awake,
but
as
you
drift
off
it
flutters
open
and
your
soul
seeks
out
its
other
half.
The
power
is
strong
in
you.”

“I
don’t
want
it.
I
want
to
be
a
knight.”

“A
knight
is
what
you
want.
A
warg
is
what
you
are.
You
can’t
change
that,
Bran,
you
can’t
deny
it
or
push
it
away.
You
are
the
winged
wolf,
but
you
will
never
fly.”
Jojen
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window.
“Unless
you
open
your
eye.”
He
put
two
fingers
together
and
poked
Bran
in
the
forehead,
hard.

When
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
spot,
Bran
felt
only
the
smooth
unbroken
skin.
There
was
no
eye,
not
even
a
closed
one.
“How
can
I
open
it
if
it’s
not
there?”

“You
will
never
find
the
eye
with
your
fingers,
Bran.
You
must
search
with
your
heart.”
Jojen
studied
Bran’s
face
with
those
strange
green
eyes.
“Or
are
you
afraid?”

“Maester
Luwin
says
there’s
nothing
in
dreams
that
a
man
need
fear.”

“There
is,”
said
Jojen.

“What?”

“The
past.
The
future.
The
truth.”

They
left
him
more
muddled
than
ever.
When
he
was
alone,
Bran
tried
to
open
his
third
eye,
but
he
didn’t
know
how.
No
matter
how
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
and
poked
at
it,
he
couldn’t
see
any
different
than
he’d
done
before.
In
the
days
that
followed,
he
tried
to
warn
others
about
what
Jojen
had
seen,
but
it
didn’t
go
as
he
wanted.
Mikken
thought
it
was
funny.
“The
sea,
is
it?
Happens
I
always
wanted
to
see
the
sea.
Never
got
where
I
could
go
to
it,
though.
So
now
it’s
coming
to
me,
is
it?
The
gods
are
good,
to
take
such
trouble
for
a
poor
smith.”

“The
gods
will
take
me
when
they
see
fit,”
Septon
Chayle
said
quietly,
“though
I
scarcely
think
it
likely
that
I’ll
drown,
Bran.
I
grew
up
on
the
banks
of
the
White
Knife,
you
know.
I’m
quite
the
strong
swimmer.”

Alebelly
was
the
only
one
who
paid
the
warning
any
heed.
He
went
to
talk
to
Jojen
himself,
and
afterward
stopped
bathing
and
refused
to
go
near
the
well.
Finally
he
stank
so
bad
that
six
of
the
other
guards
threw
him
into
a
tub
of
scalding
water
and
scrubbed
him
raw
while
he
screamed
that
they
were
going
to
drown
him
like
the
frogboy
had
said.
Thereafter
he
scowled
whenever
he
saw
Bran
or
Jojen
about
the
castle,
and
muttered
under
his
breath.

It
was
a
few
days
after
Alebelly’s
bath
that
Ser
Rodrik
returned
to
Winterfell
with
his
prisoner,
a
fleshy
young
man
with
fat
moist
lips
and
long
hair
who
smelled
like
a
privy,
even
worse
than
Alebelly
had.
“Reek,
he’s
called,”
Hayhead
said
when
Bran
asked
who
it
was.
“I
never
heard
his
true
name.
He
served
the
Bastard
of
Bolton
and
helped
him
murder
Lady
Hornwood,
they
say.”

The
Bastard
himself
was
dead,
Bran
learned
that
evening
over
supper.
Ser
Rodrik’s
men
had
caught
him
on
Hornwood
land
doing
something
horrible
(Bran
wasn’t
quite
sure
what,
but
it
seemed
to
be
something
you
did
without
your
clothes)
and
shot
him
down
with
arrows
as
he
tried
to
ride
away.
They
came
too
late
for
poor
Lady
Hornwood,
though.
After
their
wedding,
the
Bastard
had
locked
her
in
a
tower
and
neglected
to
feed
her.
Bran
had
heard
men
saying
that
when
Ser
Rodrik
had
smashed
down
the
door
he
found
her
with
her
mouth
all
bloody
and
her
fingers
chewed
off.

“The
monster
has
tied
us
a
thorny
knot,”
the
old
knight
told
Maester
Luwin.
“Like
it
or
no,
Lady
Hornwood
was
his
wife.
He
made
her
say
the
vows
before
both
septon
and
heart
tree,
and
bedded
her
that
very
night
before
witnesses.
She
signed
a
will
naming
him
as
heir
and
fixed
her
seal
to
it.”

“Vows
made
at
sword
point
are
not
valid,”
the
maester
argued.

“Roose
Bolton
may
not
agree.
Not
with
land
at
issue.”
Ser
Rodrik
looked
unhappy.
“Would
that
I
could
take
this
serving
man’s
head
off
as
well,
he’s
as
bad
as
his
master.
But
I
fear
I
must
keep
him
alive
until
Robb
returns
from
his
wars.
He
is
the
only
witness
to
the
worst
of
the
Bastard’s
crimes.
Perhaps
when
Lord
Bolton
hears
his
tale,
he
will
abandon
his
claim,
but
meantime
we
have
Manderly
knights
and
Dreadfort
men
killing
one
another
in
Hornwood
forests,
and
I
lack
the
strength
to
stop
them.”
The
old
knight
turned
in
his
seat
and
gave
Bran
a
stern
look.
“And
what
have
you
been
about
while
I’ve
been
away,
my
lord
prince?
Commanding
our
guardsmen
not
to
wash?
Do
you
want
them
smelling
like
this
Reek,
is
that
it?”

“The
sea
is
coming
here,”
Bran
said.
“Jojen
saw
it
in
a
green
dream.
Alebelly
is
going
to
drown.”

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
collar.
“The
Reed
boy
believes
he
sees
the
future
in
his
dreams,
Ser
Rodrik.
I’ve
spoken
to
Bran
about
the
uncertainty
of
such
prophecies,
but
if
truth
be
told,
there
is
trouble
along
the
Stony
Shore.
Raiders
in
longships,
plundering
fishing
villages.
Raping
and
burning.
Leobald
Tallhart
has
sent
his
nephew
Benfred
to
deal
with
them,
but
I
expect
they’ll
take
to
their
ships
and
flee
at
the
first
sight
of
armed
men.”

“Aye,
and
strike
somewhere
else.
The
Others
take
all
such
cowards.
They
would
never
dare,
no
more
than
the
Bastard
of
Bolton,
if
our
main
strength
were
not
a
thousand
leagues
south.”
Ser
Rodrik
looked
at
Bran.
“What
else
did
the
lad
tell
you?”

“He
said
the
water
would
flow
over
our
walls.
He
saw
Alebelly
drowned,
and
Mikken
and
Septon
Chayle
too.”

Ser
Rodrik
frowned.
“Well,
should
it
happen
that
I
need
to
ride
against
these
raiders
myself,
I
shan’t
take
Alebelly,
then.
He
didn’t
see
me
drowned,
did
he?
No?
Good.”

It
heartened
Bran
to
hear
that.
Maybe
they
won’t
drown,
then,
he
thought.
If
they
stay
away
from
the
sea.

Meera
thought
so
too,
later
that
night
when
she
and
Joien
met
Bran
in
his
room
to
play
a
three-sided
game
of
tiles,
but
her
brother
shook
his
head.
“The
things
I
see
in
green
dreams
can’t
be
changed.”

That
made
his
sister
angry.
“Why
would
the
gods
send
a
warning
if
we
can’t
heed
it
and
change
what’s
to
come?”

“I
don’t
know,”
Joien
said
sadly.

“If
you
were
Alebelly,
you’d
probably
jump
into
the
well
to
have
done
with
it!
He
should
fight,
and
Bran
should
too.”

“Me?”
Bran
felt
suddenly
afraid.
“What
should
I
fight?
Am
I
going
to
drown
too?”

Meera
looked
at
him
guiltily.
“I
shouldn’t
have
said…”

He
could
tell
that
she
was
hiding
something.
“Did
you
see
me
in
a
green
dream?”
he
asked
Jojen
nervously.
“Was
I
drowned?”

“Not
drowned.”
Jojen
spoke
as
if
every
word
pained
him.
“I
dreamed
of
the
man
who
came
today,
the
one
they
call
Reek.
You
and
your
brother
lay
dead
at
his
feet,
and
he
was
skinning
off
your
faces
with
a
long
red
blade.”

Meera
rose
to
her
feet.
“If
I
went
to
the
dungeon,
I
could
drive
a
spear
right
through
his
heart.
How
could
he
murder
Bran
if
he
was
dead?”

“The
gaolers
will
stop
you,”
Joien
said.
“The
guards.
And
if
you
tell
them
why
you
want
him
dead,
they’ll
never
believe.”

“I
have
guards
too,”
Bran
reminded
them.
“Alebelly
and
Poxy
Tym
and
Hayhead
and
the
rest.”

Jojen’s
mossy
eyes
were
full
of
pity.
“They
won’t
be
able
to
stop
him,
Bran.
I
couldn’t
see
why,
but
I
saw
the
end
of
it.
I
saw
you
and
Rickon
in
your
crypts,
down
in
the
dark
with
all
the
dead
kings
and
their
stone
wolves.”

No,
Bran
thought.
No.
“If
I
went
away…
to
Greywater,
or
to
the
crow,
someplace
far
where
they
couldn’t
find
me…”

“It
will
not
matter.
The
dream
was
green,
Bran,
and
the
green
dreams
do
not
lie.”





TYRION

Vrys
stood
over
the
brazier,
warming
his
soft
hands.
“It
would
appear
Renly
was
murdered
most
fearfully
in
the
very
midst
of
his
army.
His
throat
was
opened
from
ear
to
ear
by
a
blade
that
passed
through
steel
and
bone
as
if
they
were
soft
cheese.”

“Murdered
by
whose
hand?”
Cersei
demanded.

“Have
you
ever
considered
that
too
many
answers
are
the
same
as
no
answer
at
all?
My
informers
are
not
always
as
highly
placed
as
we
might
like.
When
a
king
dies,
fancies
sprout
like
mushrooms
in
the
dark.
A
groom
says
that
Renly
was
slain
by
a
knight
of
his
own
Rainbow
Guard.
A
washerwoman
claims
Stannis
stole
through
the
heart
of
his
brother’s
army
with
his
magic
sword.
Several
men-at-arms
believe
a
woman
did
the
fell
deed,
but
cannot
agree
on
which
woman.
A
maid
that
Renly
had
spurned,
claims
one.
A
camp
follower
brought
in
to
serve
his
pleasure
on
the
eve
of
battle,
says
a
second.
The
third
ventures
that
it
might
have
been
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.”

The
queen
was
not
pleased.
“Must
you
waste
our
time
with
every
rumor
the
fools
care
to
tell?”

“You
pay
me
well
for
these
rumors,
my
gracious
queen.”

“We
pay
you
for
the
truth,
Lord
Varys.
Remember
that,
or
this
small
council
may
grow
smaller
still.”

Varys
tittered
nervously.
“You
and
your
noble
brother
will
leave
His
Grace
with
no
council
at
all
if
you
continue.”

“I
daresay,
the
realm
could
survive
a
few
less
councillors,”
said
Littlefinger
with
a
smile.

“Dear
dear
Petyr,”
said
Varys,
“are
you
not
concerned
that
yours
might
be
the
next
name
on
the
Hand’s
little
list?”

“Before
you,
Varys?
I
should
never
dream
of
it.”

“Mayhaps
we
will
be
brothers
on
the
Wall
together,
you
and
I.”
Varys
giggled
again.

“Sooner
than
you’d
like,
if
the
next
words
out
of
your
mouth
are
not
something
useful,
eunuch.”
From
the
look
of
her
eyes,
Cersei
was
prepared
to
castrate
Varys
all
over
again.

“Might
this
be
some
ruse?”
asked
Littlefinger.

“If
so,
it
is
a
ruse
of
surpassing
cleverness,”
said
Varys.
“It
has
certainly
hoodwinked
me.”

Tyrion
had
heard
enough.
“Joff
will
be
so
disappointed,”
he
said.
“He
was
saving
such
a
nice
spike
for
Renly’s
head.
But
whoever
did
the
deed,
we
must
assume
Stannis
was
behind
it.
The
gain
is
clearly
his.”
He
did
not
like
this
news;
he
had
counted
on
the
brothers
Baratheon
decimating
each
other
in
bloody
battle.
He
could
feel
his
elbow
throbbing
where
the
morningstar
had
laid
it
open.
It
did
that
sometimes
in
the
damp.
He
squeezed
it
uselessly
in
his
hand
and
asked,
“What
of
Renly’s
host?”

“The
greater
part
of
his
foot
remains
at
Bitterbridge.”
Varys
abandoned
the
brazier
to
take
his
seat
at
the
table.
“Most
of
the
lords
who
rode
with
Lord
Renly
to
Storm’s
End
have
gone
over
banner-and-blade
to
Stannis,
with
all
their
chivalry.”

“Led
by
the
Florents,
I’d
wager,”
said
Littlefinger.

Varys
gave
him
a
simpering
smile.
“You
would
win,
my
lord.
Lord
Alester
was
indeed
the
first
to
bend
the
knee.
Many
others
followed.”

“Many,”
Tyrion
said
pointedly,
“but
not
all?”

“Not
all,”
agreed
the
eunuch.
“Not
Loras
Tyrell,
nor
Randyll
Tarly,
nor
Mathis
Rowan.
And
Storm’s
End
itself
has
not
yielded.
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
holds
the
castle
in
Renly’s
name,
and
will
not
believe
his
liege
is
dead.
He
demands
to
see
the
mortal
remains
before
he
opens
his
gates,
but
it
seems
that
Renly’s
corpse
has
unaccountably
vanished.
Carried
away,
most
likely.
A
fifth
of
Renly’s
knights
departed
with
Ser
Loras
rather
than
bend
the
knee
to
Stannis.
It’s
said
the
Knight
of
Flowers
went
mad
when
he
saw
his
king’s
body,
and
slew
three
of
Renly’s
guards
in
his
wrath,
among
them
Emmon
Cuy
and
Robar
Royce.”

A
pity
he
stopped
at
three,
thought
Tyrion.

“Ser
Loras
is
likely
making
for
Bitterbridge,”
Varys
went
on.
“His
sister
is
there,
Renly’s
queen,
as
well
as
a
great
many
soldiers
who
suddenly
find
themselves
kingless.
Which
side
will
they
take
now?
A
ticklish
question.
Many
serve
the
lords
who
remained
at
Storm’s
End,
and
those
lords
now
belong
to
Stannis.”

Tyrion
leaned
forward.
“There
is
a
chance
here,
it
seems
to
me.
Win
Loras
Tyrell
to
our
cause
and
Lord
Mace
Tyrell
and
his
bannermen
might
join
us
as
well.
They
may
have
sworn
their
swords
to
Stannis
for
the
moment,
yet
they
cannot
love
the
man,
or
they
would
have
been
his
from
the
start.”

“Is
their
love
for
us
any
greater?”
asked
Cersei.

“Scarcely,”
said
Tyrion.
“They
loved
Renly,
clearly,
but
Renly
is
slain.
Perhaps
we
can
give
them
good
and
sufficient
reasons
to
prefer
Joffrey
to
Stannis…
if
we
move
quickly.”

“What
sort
of
reasons
do
you
mean
to
give
them?”

“Gold
reasons,”
Littlefinger
suggested
at
once.

Varys
made
a
tsking
sound.
“Sweet
Petyr,
surely
you
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
these
puissant
lords
and
noble
knights
could
be
bought
like
so
many
chickens
in
the
market.”

“Have
you
been
to
our
markets
of
late,
Lord
Varys?”
asked
Littlefinger.
“You’d
find
it
easier
to
buy
a
lord
than
a
chicken,
I
daresay.
Of
course,
lords
cluck
prouder
than
chickens,
and
take
it
ill
if
you
offer
them
coin
like
a
tradesman,
but
they
are
seldom
adverse
to
taking
gifts…
honors,
lands,
castles…”

“Bribes
might
sway
some
of
the
lesser
lords,”
Tyrion
said,
“but
never
Highgarden.”

“True,”
Littlefinger
admitted.
“The
Knight
of
Flowers
is
the
key
there.
Mace
Tyrell
has
two
older
sons,
but
Loras
has
always
been
his
favorite.
Win
him,
and
Highgarden
will
be
yours.”

Yes,
Tyrion
thought.
“It
seems
to
me
we
should
take
a
lesson
from
the
late
Lord
Renly.
We
can
win
the
Tyrell
alliance
as
he
did.
With
a
marriage.”

Varys
understood
the
quickest.
“You
think
to
wed
King
Joffrey
to
Margaery
Tyrell.”

“I
do.”
Renly’s
young
queen
was
no
more
than
fifteen,
sixteen,
he
seemed
to
recall…
older
than
Joffrey,
but
a
few
years
were
nothing,
it
was
so
neat
and
sweet
he
could
taste
it.

“Joffrey
is
betrothed
to
Sansa
Stark,”
Cersei
objected.

“Marriage
contracts
can
be
broken.
What
advantage
is
there
in
wedding
the
king
to
the
daughter
of
a
dead
traitor?”

Littlefinger
spoke
up.
“You
might
point
out
to
His
Grace
that
the
Tyrells
are
much
wealthier
than
the
Starks,
and
that
Margaery
is
said
to
be
lovely…
and
beddable
besides.”

“Yes,”
said
Tyrion,
“Joff
ought
to
like
that
well
enough.”

“My
son
is
too
young
to
care
about
such
things.”

“You
think
so?”
asked
Tyrion.
“He’s
thirteen,
Cersei.
The
same
age
at
which
I
married.”

“You
shamed
us
all
with
that
sorry
episode.
Joffrey
is
made
of
finer
stuff.”

“So
fine
that
he
had
Ser
Boros
rip
off
Sansa’s
gown.”

“He
was
angry
with
the
girl.”

“He
was
angry
with
that
cook’s
boy
who
spilled
the
soup
last
night
as
well,
but
he
didn’t
strip
him
naked.”

“This
was
not
a
matter
of
some
spilled
soup—”

No,
it
was
a
matter
of
some
pretty
teats.
After
that
business
in
the
yard,
Tyrion
had
spoken
with
Varys
about
how
they
might
arrange
for
Joffrey
to
visit
Chataya’s.
A
taste
of
honey
might
sweeten
the
boy,
he
hoped.
He
might
even
be
grateful,
gods
forbid,
and
Tyrion
could
do
with
a
shade
more
gratitude
from
his
sovereign.
It
would
need
to
be
done
secretly,
of
course.
The
tricky
bit
would
be
parting
him
from
the
Hound.
“The
dog
is
never
far
from
his
master’s
heels,”
he’d
observed
to
Varys,
“but
all
men
sleep.
And
some
gamble
and
whore
and
visit
winesinks
as
well.”

“The
Hound
does
all
these
things,
if
that
is
your
question.”

“No,”
said
Tyrion.
“My
question
is
when.”

Varys
had
laid
a
finger
on
his
cheek,
smiling
enigmatically.
“My
lord,
a
suspicious
man
might
think
you
wished
to
find
a
time
when
Sandor
Clegane
was
not
protecting
King
Joffrey,
the
better
to
do
the
boy
some
harm.”

“Surely
you
know
me
better
than
that,
Lord
Varys,”
Tyrion
said.
“Why,
all
I
want
is
for
Joffrey
to
love
me.”

The
eunuch
had
promised
to
look
into
the
matter.
The
war
made
its
own
demands,
though;
Joffrey’s
initiation
into
manhood
would
need
to
wait.
“Doubtless
you
know
your
son
better
than
I
do,”
he
made
himself
tell
Cersei,
“but
regardless,
there’s
still
much
to
be
said
for
a
Tyrell
marriage.
It
may
be
the
only
way
that
Joffrey
lives
long
enough
to
reach
his
wedding
night.”

Littlefinger
agreed.
“The
Stark
girl
brings
Joffrey
nothing
but
her
body,
sweet
as
that
may
be.
Margaery
Tyrell
brings
fifty
thousand
swords
and
all
the
strength
of
Highgarden.”

“Indeed.”
Varys
laid
a
soft
hand
on
the
queen’s
sleeve.
“You
have
a
mother’s
heart,
and
I
know
His
Grace
loves
his
little
sweetling.
Yet
kings
must
learn
to
put
the
needs
of
the
realm
before
their
own
desires.
I
say
this
offer
must
be
made.”

The
queen
pulled
free
of
the
eunuch’s
touch.
“You
would
not
speak
so
if
you
were
women.
Say
what
you
will,
my
lords,
but
Joffrey
is
too
proud
to
settle
for
Renly’s
leavings.
He
will
never
consent.”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“When
the
king
comes
of
age
in
three
years,
he
may
give
or
withhold
his
consent
as
he
pleases.
Until
then,
you
are
his
regent
and
I
am
his
Hand,
and
he
will
marry
whomever
we
tell
him
to
marry.
Leavings
or
no.”

Cersei’s
quiver
was
empty.
“Make
your
offer
then,
but
gods
save
you
all
if
Joff
does
not
like
this
girl.”

“I’m
so
pleased
we
can
agree,”
Tyrion
said.
“Now,
which
of
us
shall
go
to
Bitterbridge?
We
must
reach
Ser
Loras
with
our
offer
before
his
blood
can
cool.”

“You
mean
to
send
one
of
the
council?”

“I
can
scarcely
expect
the
Knight
of
Flowers
to
treat
with
Bronn
or
Shagga,
can
I?
The
Tyrells
are
proud.”

His
sister
wasted
no
time
trying
to
twist
the
situation
to
her
advantage.
“Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
is
nobly
born.
Send
him.”

Tyrion
shook
his
head.
“We
need
someone
who
can
do
more
than
repeat
our
words
and
fetch
back
a
reply.
Our
envoy
must
speak
for
king
and
council
and
settle
the
matter
quickly.”

“The
Hand
speaks
with
the
king’s
voice.”
Candlelight
gleamed
green
as
wildfire
in
Cersei’s
eyes.
“If
we
send
you,
Tyrion,
it
will
be
as
if
Joffrey
went
himself.
And
who
better,
You
wield
words
as
skillfully
as
Jaime
wields
a
sword.”

Are
you
that
eager
to
get
me
out
of
the
city,
Cersei?
“You
are
too
kind,
sister,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
boy’s
mother
is
better
fitted
to
arrange
his
marriage
than
any
uncle.
And
you
have
a
gift
for
winning
friends
that
I
could
never
hope
to
match.”

Her
eyes
narrowed.
“Joff
needs
me
at
his
side.”

“Your
Grace,
my
lord
Hand,”
said
Littlefinger,
“the
king
needs
both
of
you
here.
Let
me
go
in
your
stead.”

“You?”
What
gain
does
he
see
in
this?
Tyrion
wondered.

“I
am
of
the
king’s
council,
yet
not
the
king’s
blood,
so
I
would
make
a
poor
hostage.
I
knew
Ser
Loras
passing
well
when
he
was
here
at
court,
and
gave
him
no
cause
to
mislike
me.
Mace
Tyrell
bears
me
no
enmity
that
I
know
of,
and
I
flatter
myself
that
I
am
not
unskilled
in
negotiation.”

He
has
us.
Tyrion
did
not
trust
Petyr
Baelish,
nor
did
he
want
the
man
out
of
his
sight,
yet
what
other
choice
was
left
him?
It
must
be
Littlefinger
or
Tyrion
himself,
and
he
knew
full
well
that
if
he
left
King’s
Landing
for
any
length
of
time,
all
that
he
had
managed
to
accomplish
would
be
undone.
“There
is
fighting
between
here
and
Bitterbridge,”
he
said
cautiously.
“And
you
can
be
past
certain
that
Lord
Stannis
will
be
dispatching
his
own
shepherds
to
gather
in
his
brother’s
wayward
lambs.”

“I’ve
never
been
frightened
of
shepherds.
It’s
the
sheep
who
trouble
me.
Still,
I
suppose
an
escort
might
be
in
order.”

“I
can
spare
a
hundred
gold
cloaks,”
Tyrion
said.

“Five
hundred.”

“Three
hundred.”

“And
forty
more—twenty
knights
with
as
many
squires.
If
I
arrive
without
a
knightly
tail,
the
Tyrells
will
think
me
of
small
account.”

That
was
true
enough.
“Agreed.”

“I’ll
include
Horror
and
Slobber
in
my
party,
and
send
them
on
to
their
lord
father
afterward.
A
gesture
of
goodwill.
We
need
Paxter
Redwyne,
he’s
Mace
Tyrell’s
oldest
friend,
and
a
great
power
in
his
own
right.”

“And
a
traitor,”
the
queen
said,
balking.
“The
Arbor
would
have
declared
for
Renly
with
all
the
rest,
except
that
Redwyne
knew
full
well
his
whelps
would
suffer
for
it.”

“Renly
is
dead,
Your
Grace,”
Littlefinger
pointed
out,
“and
neither
Stannis
nor
Lord
Paxter
will
have
forgotten
how
Redwyne
galleys
closed
the
sea
during
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End.
Restore
the
twins
and
perchance
we
may
win
Redwyne’s
love.”

Cersei
remained
unconvinced.
“The
Others
can
keep
his
love,
I
want
his
swords
and
sails.
Holding
tight
to
those
twins
is
the
best
way
to
make
certain
that
we’ll
have
them.”

Tyrion
had
the
answer.
“Then
let
us
send
Ser
Hobber
back
to
the
Arbor
and
keep
Ser
Horas
here.
Lord
Paxter
ought
to
be
clever
enough
to
riddle
out
the
meaning
of
that,
I
should
think.”

The
suggestion
was
carried
without
protest,
but
Littlefinger
was
not
done.
“We’ll
want
horses.
Swift
and
strong.
The
fighting
will
make
remounts
hard
to
come
by.
A
goodly
supply
of
gold
will
also
be
needed,
for
those
gifts
we
spoke
of
earlier.”

“Take
as
much
as
you
require.
If
the
city
falls,
Stannis
will
steal
it
all
anyway.”

“I’ll
want
my
commission
in
writing.
A
document
that
will
leave
Mace
Tyrell
in
no
doubt
as
to
my
authority,
granting
me
full
power
to
treat
with
him
concerning
this
match
and
any
other
arrangements
that
might
be
required,
and
to
make
binding
pledges
in
the
king’s
name.
It
should
be
signed
by
Joffrey
and
every
member
of
this
council,
and
bear
all
our
seals.”

Tyrion
shifted
uncomfortably.
“Done.
Will
that
be
all?
I
remind
you,
there’s
a
long
road
between
here
and
Bitterbridge.”

“I’ll
be
riding
it
before
dawn
breaks.”
Littlefinger
rose.
“I
trust
that
on
my
return,
the
king
will
see
that
I
am
suitably
rewarded
for
my
valiant
efforts
in
his
cause?”

Varys
giggled.
“Joffrey
is
such
a
grateful
sovereign,
I’m
certain
you
will
have
no
cause
to
complain,
my
good
brave
lord.”

The
queen
was
more
direct.
“What
do
you
want,
Petyr?”

Littlefinger
glanced
at
Tyrion
with
a
sly
smile.
“I
shall
need
to
give
that
some
consideration.
No
doubt
I’ll
think
of
something.”
He
sketched
an
airy
bow
and
took
his
leave,
as
casual
as
if
he
were
off
to
one
of
his
brothels.

Tyrion
glanced
out
the
window.
The
fog
was
so
thick
that
he
could
not
even
see
the
curtain
wall
across
the
yard.
A
few
dim
lights
shone
indistinct
through
that
greyness.
A
foul
day
for
travel,
he
thought.
He
did
not
envy
Petyr
Baelish.
“We
had
best
see
to
drawing
up
those
documents.
Lord
Varys,
send
for
parchment
and
quill.
And
someone
will
need
to
wake
Joffrey.”

It
was
still
grey
and
dark
when
the
meeting
finally
ended.
Varys
scurried
off
alone,
his
soft
slippers
whisking
along
the
floor.
The
Lannisters
lingered
a
moment
by
the
door.
“How
comes
your
chain,
brother?”
the
queen
asked
as
Ser
Preston
fastened
a
vair-lined
cloth-of-silver
cloak
about
her
shoulders.

“Link
by
link,
it
grows
longer.
We
should
thank
the
gods
that
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
as
stubborn
as
he
is.
Stannis
will
never
march
north
with
Storm’s
End
untaken
in
his
rear.”

“Tyrion,
I
know
we
do
not
always
agree
on
policy,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
I
was
wrong
about
you.
You
are
not
so
big
a
fool
as
I
imagined.
In
truth,
I
realize
now
that
you
have
been
a
great
help.
For
that
I
thank
you.
You
must
forgive
me
if
I
have
spoken
to
you
harshly
in
the
past.”

“Must
I?”
He
gave
her
a
shrug,
a
smile.
“Sweet
sister,
you
have
said
nothing
that
requires
forgiveness.”

“Today,
you
mean?”
They
both
laughed…
and
Cersei
leaned
over
and
planted
a
quick,
soft
kiss
on
his
brow.

Too
astonished
for
words,
Tyrion
could
only
watch
her
stride
off
down
the
hall,
Ser
Preston
at
her
side.
“Have
I
lost
my
wits,
or
did
my
sister
just
kiss
me?”
he
asked
Bronn
when
she
was
gone.

“Was
it
so
sweet?”

“It
was…
unanticipated.”
Cersei
had
been
behaving
queerly
of
late.
Tyrion
found
it
very
unsettling.
“I
am
trying
to
recall
the
last
time
she
kissed
me.
I
could
not
have
been
more
than
six
or
seven.
Jaime
had
dared
her
to
do
it.”

“The
woman’s
finally
taken
note
of
your
charms.”

“No,”
Tyrion
said.
“No,
the
woman
is
hatching
something.
Best
find
out
what,
Bronn.
You
know
I
hate
surprises.”





THEON

Theon
wiped
the
spittle
off
his
cheek
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Robb
will
gut
you,
Greyjoy,”
Benfred
Tallheart
screamed.
“He’ll
feed
your
turncloak’s
heart
to
his
wolf,
you
piece
of
sheep
dung.”

Aeron
Damphair’s
voice
cut
through
the
insults
like
a
sword
through
cheese.
“Now
you
must
kill
him.”

“I
have
questions
for
him
first,”
said
Theon.

“Fuck
your
questions.”
Benfred
hung
bleeding
and
helpless
between
Stygg
and
Werlag.
“You’ll
choke
on
them
before
you
get
any
answers
from
me,
craven.
Turncloak.”

Uncle
Aeron
was
relentless.
“When
he
spits
on
you,
he
spits
on
all
of
us.
He
spits
on
the
Drowned
God.
He
must
die.”

“My
father
gave
me
the
command
here,
Uncle.”

“And
sent
me
to
counsel
you.”

And
to
watch
me.
Theon
dare
not
push
matters
too
far
with
his
uncle.
The
command
was
his,
yes,
but
his
men
had
a
faith
in
the
Drowned
God
that
they
did
not
have
in
him,
and
they
were
terrified
of
Aeron
Damphair.
I
cannot
fault
them
for
that.

“You’ll
lose
your
head
for
this,
Greyjoy.
The
crows
will
eat
the
jelly
of
your
eyes.”
Benfred
tried
to
spit
again,
but
only
managed
a
little
blood.
“The
Others
bugger
your
wet
god.”

Tallhart,
you’ve
spit
away
your
life,
Theon
thought.
“Stygg,
silence
him,”
he
said.

They
forced
Benfred
to
his
knees.
Werlag
tore
the
rabbitskin
off
his
belt
and
jammed
it
between
his
teeth
to
stop
his
shouting.
Stygg
unlimbered
his
axe.

“No,”
Aeron
Damphair
declared.
“He
must
be
given
to
the
god.
The
old
way.”

What
does
it
matter?
Dead
is
dead.
“Take
him,
then.”

“You
will
come
as
well.
You
command
here.
The
offering
should
come
from
you.”

That
was
more
than
Theon
could
stomach.
“You
are
the
priest,
Uncle,
I
leave
the
god
to
you.
Do
me
the
same
kindness
and
leave
the
battles
to
me.”
He
waved
his
hand,
and
Werlag
and
Stygg
began
to
drag
their
captive
off
toward
the
shore.
Aeron
Damphair
gave
his
nephew
a
reproachful
look,
then
followed.
Down
to
the
pebbled
beach
they
would
go,
to
drown
Benfred
Tallhart
in
salt
water.
The
old
way.

Perhaps
it’s
a
kindness,
Theon
told
himself
as
he
stalked
off
in
the
other
direction.
Stygg
was
hardly
the
most
expert
of
headsmen,
and
Benfred
had
a
neck
thick
as
a
boar’s,
heavy
with
muscle
and
fat.
I
used
to
mock
him
for
it,
just
to
see
how
angry
I
could
make
him,
he
remembered.
That
had
been,
what,
three
years
past?
When
Ned
Stark
had
ridden
to
Torrhen’s
Square
to
see
Ser
Helman,
Theon
had
accompanied
him
and
spent
a
fortnight
in
Benfred’s
company.

He
could
hear
the
rough
noises
of
victory
from
the
crook
in
the
road
where
the
battle
had
been
fought…
if
you’d
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
battle.
More
like
slaughtering
sheep,
if
truth
be
told.
Sheep
fleeced
in
steel,
but
sheep
nonetheless.

Climbing
a
jumble
of
stone,
Theon
looked
down
on
the
dead
men
and
dying
horses.
The
horses
had
deserved
better.
Tymor
and
his
brothers
had
gathered
up
what
mounts
had
come
through
the
fight
unhurt,
while
Urzen
and
Black
Lorren
silenced
the
animals
too
badly
wounded
to
be
saved.
The
rest
of
his
men
were
looting
the
corpses.
Gevin
Harlaw
knelt
on
a
dead
man’s
chest,
sawing
off
his
finger
to
get
at
a
ring.
Paying
the
iron
price.
My
lord
father
would
approve.
Theon
thought
of
seeking
out
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
he’d
slain
himself
to
see
if
they
had
any
jewelry
worth
the
taking,
but
the
notion
left
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth.
He
could
imagine
what
Eddard
Stark
would
have
said.
Yet
that
thought
made
him
angry
too.
Stark
is
dead
and
rotting,
and
naught
to
me,
he
reminded
himself.

Old
Botley,
who
was
called
Fishwhiskers,
sat
scowling
by
his
pile
of
plunder
while
his
three
sons
added
to
it.
One
of
them
was
in
a
shoving
match
with
a
fat
man
named
Todric,
who
was
reeling
among
the
slain
with
a
horn
of
ale
in
one
hand
and
an
axe
in
the
other,
clad
in
a
cloak
of
white
foxfur
only
slightly
stained
by
the
blood
of
its
previous
owner.
Drunk,
Theon
decided,
watching
him
bellow.
It
was
said
that
the
ironmen
of
old
had
oft
been
blood-drunk
in
battle,
so
berserk
that
they
felt
no
pain
and
feared
no
foe,
but
this
was
a
common
ale-drunk.

“Wex,
my
bow
and
quiver.”
The
boy
ran
and
fetched
them.
Theon
bent
the
bow
and
slipped
the
string
into
its
notches
as
Todric
knocked
down
the
Botley
boy
and
flung
ale
into
his
eyes.
Fishwhiskers
leapt
up
cursing,
but
Theon
was
quicker.
He
drew
on
the
hand
that
clutched
the
drinking
horn,
figuring
to
give
them
a
shot
to
talk
about,
but
Todric
spoiled
it
by
lurching
to
one
side
just
as
he
loosed.
The
arrow
took
him
through
the
belly.

The
looters
stopped
to
gape.
Theon
lowered
his
bow.
“No
drunkards,
I
said,
and
no
squabbles
over
plunder.”
On
his
knees,
Todric
was
dying
noisily.
“Botley,
silence
him.”
Fishwhiskers
and
his
sons
were
quick
to
obey.
They
slit
Todric’s
throat
as
he
kicked
feebly,
and
were
stripping
him
of
cloak
and
rings
and
weapons
before
he
was
even
dead.

Now
they
know
I
mean
what
I
say.
Lord
Balon
might
have
given
him
the
command,
but
Theon
knew
that
some
of
his
men
saw
only
a
soft
boy
from
the
green
lands
when
they
looked
at
him.
“Anyone
else
have
a
thirst?”
No
one
replied.
“Good.”
He
kicked
at
Benfred’s
fallen
banner,
clutched
in
the
dead
hand
of
the
squire
who’d
borne
it.
A
rabbitskin
had
been
tied
below
the
flag.
Why
rabbitskins?
he
had
meant
to
ask,
but
being
spat
on
had
made
him
forget
his
questions.
He
tossed
his
bow
back
to
Wex
and
strode
off,
remembering
how
elated
he’d
felt
after
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
wondering
why
this
did
not
taste
as
sweet.
Tallhart,
you
bloody
overproud
fool,
you
never
even
sent
out
a
scout.

They’d
been
joking
and
even
singing
as
they’d
come
on,
the
three
trees
of
Tallhart
streaming
above
them
while
rabbitskins
flapped
stupidly
from
the
points
of
their
lances.
The
archers
concealed
behind
the
gorse
had
spoiled
the
song
with
a
rain
of
arrows,
and
Theon
himself
had
led
his
men-at-arms
out
to
finish
the
butcher’s
work
with
dagger,
axe,
and
warhammer.
He
had
ordered
their
leader
spared
for
questioning.

Only
he
had
not
expected
it
to
be
Benfred
Tallhart.

His
limp
body
was
being
dragged
from
the
surf
when
Theon
returned
to
his
Sea
Bitch.
The
masts
of
his
longships
stood
outlined
against
the
sky
along
the
pebbled
beach.
Of
the
fishing
village,
nothing
remained
but
cold
ashes
that
stank
when
it
rained.
The
men
had
been
put
to
the
sword,
all
but
a
handful
that
Theon
had
allowed
to
flee
to
bring
the
word
to
Torrhen’s
Square.
Their
wives
and
daughters
had
been
claimed
for
salt
wives,
those
who
were
young
enough
and
fair.
The
crones
and
the
ugly
ones
had
simply
been
raped
and
killed,
or
taken
for
thralls
if
they
had
useful
skills
and
did
not
seem
likely
to
cause
trouble.

Theon
had
planned
that
attack
as
well,
bringing
his
ships
up
to
the
shore
in
the
chill
darkness
before
the
dawn
and
leaping
from
the
prow
with
a
longaxe
in
his
hand
to
lead
his
men
into
the
sleeping
village.
He
did
not
like
the
taste
of
any
of
this,
but
what
choice
did
he
have?

His
thrice-damned
sister
was
sailing
her
Black
Wind
north
even
now,
sure
to
win
a
castle
of
her
own.
Lord
Balon
had
let
no
word
of
the
hosting
escape
the
Iron
Islands,
and
Theon’s
bloody
work
along
the
Stony
Shore
would
be
put
down
to
sea
raiders
out
for
plunder.
The
northmen
would
not
realize
their
true
peril,
not
until
the
hammers
fell
on
Deepwood
Motte
and
Moat
Cailin.
And
after
all
is
done
and
won,
they
will
make
songs
for
that
bitch
Asha,
and
forget
that
I
was
even
here.
That
is,
if
he
allowed
it.

Dagmer
Cleftjaw
stood
by
the
high
carved
prow
of
his
longship,
Foamdrinker.
Theon
had
assigned
him
the
task
of
guarding
the
ships;
otherwise
men
would
have
called
it
Dagmer’s
victory,
not
his.
A
more
prickly
man
might
have
taken
that
for
a
slight,
but
the
Cleftjaw
had
only
laughed.

“The
day
is
won,”
Dagmer
called
down.
“And
yet
you
do
not
smile,
boy.
The
living
should
smile,
for
the
dead
cannot.”
He
smiled
himself
to
show
how
it
was
done.
It
made
for
a
hideous
sight.
Under
a
snowy
white
mane
of
hair,
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
had
the
most
gut-churning
scar
Theon
had
ever
seen,
the
legacy
of
the
longaxe
that
had
near
killed
him
as
a
boy.
The
blow
had
splintered
his
jaw,
shattered
his
front
teeth,
and
left
him
four
lips
where
other
men
had
but
two.
A
shaggy
beard
covered
his
cheeks
and
neck,
but
the
hair
would
not
grow
over
the
scar,
so
a
shiny
seam
of
puckered,
twisted
flesh
divided
his
face
like
a
crevasse
through
a
snowfield.
“We
could
hear
them
singing,”
the
old
warrior
said.
“It
was
a
good
song,
and
they
sang
it
bravely.”

“They
sang
better
than
they
fought.
Harps
would
have
done
them
as
much
good
as
their
lances
did.”

“How
many
men
are
lost?”

“Of
ours?”
Theon
shrugged.
“Todric.
I
killed
him
for
getting
drunk
and
fighting
over
loot.”

“Some
men
are
born
to
be
killed.”
A
lesser
man
might
have
been
afraid
to
show
a
smile
as
frightening
as
his,
yet
Dagmer
grinned
more
often
and
more
broadly
than
Lord
Balon
ever
had.

Ugly
as
it
was,
that
smile
brought
back
a
hundred
memories.
Theon
had
seen
it
often
as
a
boy,
when
he’d
jumped
a
horse
over
a
mossy
wall,
or
flung
an
axe
and
split
a
target
square.
He’d
seen
it
when
he
blocked
a
blow
from
Dagmer’s
sword,
when
he
put
an
arrow
through
a
seagull
on
the
wing,
when
he
took
the
tiller
in
hand
and
guided
a
longship
safely
through
a
snarl
of
foaming
rocks.
He
gave
me
more
smiles
than
my
father
and
Eddard
Stark
together.
Even
Robb…
he
ought
to
have
won
a
smile
the
day
he’d
saved
Bran
from
that
wildling,
but
instead
he’d
gotten
a
scolding,
as
if
he
were
some
cook
who’d
burned
the
stew.

“You
and
I
must
talk,
Uncle,”
Theon
said.
Dagmer
was
no
true
uncle,
only
a
sworn
man
with
perhaps
a
pinch
of
Greyjoy
blood
four
or
five
lives
back,
and
that
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
blanket.
Yet
Theon
had
always
called
him
uncle
nonetheless.

“Come
onto
my
deck,
then.”
There
were
no
m’lords
from
Dagmer,
not
when
he
stood
on
his
own
deck.
On
the
Iron
Islands,
every
captain
was
a
king
aboard
his
own
ship.

He
climbed
the
plank
to
the
deck
of
the
Foamdrinker
in
four
long
strides,
and
Dagmer
led
him
back
to
the
cramped
aft
cabin,
where
the
old
man
poured
a
horn
of
sour
ale
and
offered
Theon
the
same.
He
declined.
“We
did
not
capture
enough
horses.
A
few,
but…
well,
I’ll
make
do
with
what
I
have,
I
suppose.
Fewer
men
means
more
glory.”

“What
need
do
we
have
of
horses?”
Like
most
ironmen,
Dagmer
preferred
to
fight
on
foot
or
from
the
deck
of
a
ship.
“Horses
will
only
shit
on
our
decks
and
get
in
our
way.”

“If
we
sailed,
yes,”
Theon
admitted.
“I
have
another
plan.”
He
watched
the
other
carefully
to
see
how
he
would
take
that.
Without
the
Cleftjaw
he
could
not
hope
to
succeed.
Command
or
no,
the
men
would
never
follow
him
if
both
Aeron
and
Dagmer
opposed
him,
and
he
had
no
hope
of
winning
over
the
sour-faced
priest.

“Your
lord
father
commanded
us
to
harry
the
coast,
no
more.”
Eyes
pale
as
sea
foam
watched
Theon
from
under
those
shaggy
white
eyebrows.
Was
it
disapproval
he
saw
there,
or
a
spark
of
interest?
The
latter,
he
thought…
hoped…

“You
are
my
father’s
man.”

“His
best
man,
and
always
have
been.”

Pride,
Theon
thought.
He
is
proud,
I
must
use
that,
his
pride
will
be
the
key.
“There
is
no
man
in
the
Iron
Islands
half
so
skilled
with
spear
or
sword.”

“You
have
been
too
long
away,
boy.
When
you
left,
it
was
as
you
say,
but
I
am
grown
old
in
Lord
Greyjoy’s
service.
The
singers
call
Andrik
best
now.
Andrik
the
Unsmiling,
they
name
him.
A
giant
of
a
man.
He
serves
Lord
Drumm
of
Old
Wyk.
And
Black
Lorren
and
Qarl
the
Maid
are
near
as
dread.”

“This
Andrik
may
be
a
great
fighter,
but
men
do
not
fear
him
as
they
fear
you.”

“Aye,
that’s
so,”
Dagmer
said.
The
fingers
curled
around
the
drinking
horn
were
heavy
with
rings,
gold
and
silver
and
bronze,
set
with
chunks
of
sapphire
and
garnet
and
dragonglass.
He
had
paid
the
iron
price
for
every
one,
Theon
knew.

“If
I
had
a
man
like
you
in
my
service,
I
should
not
waste
him
on
this
child’s
business
of
harrying
and
burning.
This
is
no
work
for
Lord
Balon’s
best
man…”

Dagmer’s
grin
twisted
his
lips
apart
and
showed
the
brown
splinters
of
his
teeth.
“Nor
for
his
trueborn
son?”
He
hooted.
“I
know
you
too
well,
Theon.
I
saw
you
take
your
first
step,
helped
you
bend
your
first
bow.
’Tis
not
me
who
feels
wasted.”

“By
rights
I
should
have
my
sister’s
command,”
he
admitted,
uncomfortably
aware
of
how
peevish
that
sounded.

“You
take
this
business
too
hard,
boy.
It
is
only
that
your
lord
father
does
not
know
you.
With
your
brothers
dead
and
you
taken
by
the
wolves,
your
sister
was
his
solace.
He
learned
to
rely
on
her,
and
she
has
never
failed
him.”

“Nor
have
I.
The
Starks
knew
my
worth.
I
was
one
of
Brynden
Blackfish’s
picked
scouts,
and
I
charged
with
the
first
wave
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
I
was
that
close
to
crossing
swords
with
the
Kingslayer
himself.”
Theon
held
his
hands
two
feet
apart.
“Daryn
Hornwood
came
between
us,
and
died
for
it.”

“Why
do
you
tell
me
this?”
Dagmer
asked.
“It
was
me
who
put
your
first
sword
in
your
hand.
I
know
you
are
no
craven.”

“Does
my
father?”

The
hoary
old
warrior
looked
as
if
he
had
bitten
into
something
he
did
not
like
the
taste
of.
“It
is
only…
Theon,
the
Boy
Wolf
is
your
friend,
and
these
Starks
had
you
for
ten
years.”

“I
am
no
Stark.”
Lord
Eddard
saw
to
that.
“I
am
a
Greyjoy,
and
I
mean
to
be
my
father’s
heir.
How
can
I
do
that
unless
I
prove
myself
with
some
great
deed?”

“You
are
young.
Other
wars
will
come,
and
you
shall
do
your
great
deeds.
For
now,
we
are
commanded
to
harry
the
Stony
Shore.”

“Let
my
uncle
Aeron
see
to
it.
I’ll
give
him
six
ships,
all
but
Foamdrinker
and
Sea
Bitch,
and
he
can
burn
and
drown
to
his
god’s
surfeit.”

“The
command
was
given
you,
not
Aeron
Damphair.”

“So
long
as
the
harrying
is
done,
what
does
it
matter?
No
priest
could
do
what
I
mean
to,
nor
what
I
ask
of
you.
I
have
a
task
that
only
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
can
accomplish.”

Dagmer
took
a
long
draught
from
his
horn.
“Tell
me.”

He
is
tempted,
Theon
thought.
He
likes
this
reaver’s
work
no
better
than
I
do.
“If
my
sister
can
take
a
castle,
so
can
I.”

“Asha
has
four
or
five
times
the
men
we
do.”

Theon
allowed
himself
a
sly
smile.
“But
we
have
four
times
the
wits,
and
five
times
the
courage.”

“Your
father—”

“—will
thank
me,
when
I
hand
him
his
kingdom.
I
mean
to
do
a
deed
that
the
harpers
will
sing
of
for
a
thousand
years.”

He
knew
that
would
give
Dagmer
pause.
A
singer
had
made
a
song
about
the
axe
that
cracked
his
jaw
in
half,
and
the
old
man
loved
to
hear
it.
Whenever
he
was
in
his
cups
he
would
call
for
a
reaving
song,
something
loud
and
stormy
that
told
of
dead
heroes
and
deeds
of
wild
valor.
His
hair
is
white
and
his
teeth
are
rotten,
but
he
still
has
a
taste
for
glory.

“What
would
my
part
be
in
this
scheme
of
yours,
boy?”
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
asked
after
a
long
silence,
and
Theon
knew
he
had
won.

“To
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
foe,
as
only
one
of
your
name
could
do.
You’ll
take
the
great
part
of
our
force
and
march
on
Torrhen’s
Square.
Helman
Tallhart
took
his
best
men
south,
and
Benfred
died
here
with
their
sons.
His
uncle
Leobald
will
remain,
with
some
small
garrison.”
If
I
had
been
able
to
question
Benfred,
I
would
know
just
how
small.
“Make
no
secret
of
your
approach.
Sing
all
the
brave
songs
you
like.
I
want
them
to
close
their
gates.”

“Is
this
Torrhen’s
Square
a
strong
keep?”

“Strong
enough.
The
walls
are
stone,
thirty
feet
high,
with
square
towers
at
each
corner
and
a
square
keep
within.”

“Stone
walls
cannot
be
fired.
How
are
we
to
take
them?
We
do
not
have
the
numbers
to
storm
even
a
small
castle.”

“You
will
make
camp
outside
their
walls
and
set
to
building
catapults
and
siege
engines.”

“That
is
not
the
Old
Way.
Have
you
forgotten?
Ironmen
fight
with
swords
and
axes,
not
by
flinging
rocks.
There
is
no
glory
in
starving
out
a
foeman.”

“Leobald
will
not
know
that.
When
he
sees
you
raising
siege
towers,
his
old
woman’s
blood
will
run
cold,
and
he
will
bleat
for
help.
Stay
your
archers,
Uncle,
and
let
the
raven
fly.
The
castellan
at
Winterfell
is
a
brave
man,
but
age
has
stiffened
his
wits
as
well
as
his
limbs.
When
he
learns
that
one
of
his
king’s
bannermen
is
under
attack
by
the
fearsome
Dagmer
Cleftjaw,
he
will
summon
his
strength
and
ride
to
Tallhart’s
aid.
It
is
his
duty.
Ser
Rodrik
is
nothing
if
not
dutiful.”

“Any
force
he
summons
will
be
larger
than
mine,”
Dagmer
said,
“and
these
old
knights
are
more
cunning
than
you
think,
or
they
would
never
have
lived
to
see
their
first
grey
hair.
You
set
us
a
battle
we
cannot
hope
to
win,
Theon.
This
Torrhen’s
Square
will
never
fall.”

Theon
smiled.
“It’s
not
Torrhen’s
Square
I
mean
to
take.”





ARYA

Confusion
and
clangor
ruled
the
castle.
Men
stood
on
the
beds
of
wagons
loading
casks
of
wine,
sacks
of
flour,
and
bundles
of
new-fletched
arrows.
Smiths
straightened
swords,
knocked
dents
from
breastplates,
and
shoed
destriers
and
pack
mules
alike.
Mail
shirts
were
tossed
in
barrels
of
sand
and
rolled
across
the
lumpy
surface
of
the
Flowstone
Yard
to
scour
them
clean.
Weese’s
women
had
twenty
cloaks
to
mend,
a
hundred
more
to
wash.
The
high
and
humble
crowded
into
the
sept
together
to
pray.
Outside
the
walls,
tents
and
pavilions
were
coming
down.
Squires
tossed
pails
of
water
over
cookfires,
while
soldiers
took
out
their
oilstones
to
give
their
blades
one
last
good
lick.
The
noise
was
a
swelling
tide:
horses
blowing
and
whickering,
lords
shouting
commands,
men-at-arms
trading
curses,
camp
followers
squabbling.

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
marching
at
last.

Ser
Addam
Marbrand
was
the
first
of
the
captains
to
depart,
a
day
before
the
rest.
He
made
a
gallant
show
of
it,
riding
a
spirited
red
courser
whose
mane
was
the
same
copper
color
as
the
long
hair
that
streamed
past
Ser
Addam’s
shoulders.
The
horse
was
barded
in
bronze-colored
trappings
dyed
to
match
the
rider’s
cloak
and
emblazoned
with
the
burning
tree.
Some
of
the
castle
women
sobbed
to
see
him
go.
Weese
said
he
was
a
great
horseman
and
sword
fighter,
Lord
Tywin’s
most
daring
commander.

I
hope
he
dies,
Arya
thought
as
she
watched
him
ride
out
the
gate,
his
men
streaming
after
him
in
a
double
column.
I
hope
they
all
die.
They
were
going
to
fight
Robb,
she
knew.
Listening
to
the
talk
as
she
went
about
her
work,
Arya
had
learned
that
Robb
had
won
some
great
victory
in
the
west.
He’d
burned
Lannisport,
some
said,
or
else
he
meant
to
burn
it.
He’d
captured
Casterly
Rock
and
put
everyone
to
the
sword,
or
he
was
besieging
the
Golden
Tooth…
but
something
had
happened,
that
much
was
certain.

Weese
had
her
running
messages
from
dawn
to
dusk.
Some
of
them
even
took
her
beyond
the
castle
walls,
out
into
the
mud
and
madness
of
the
camp.
I
could
flee,
she
thought
as
a
wagon
rumbled
past
her.
I
could
hop
on
the
back
of
a
wagon
and
hide,
or
fall
in
with
the
camp
followers,
no
one
would
stop
me.
She
might
have
done
it
if
not
for
Weese.
He’d
told
them
more
than
once
what
he’d
do
to
anyone
who
tried
to
run
off
on
him.
“It
won’t
be
no
beating,
oh,
no.
I
won’t
lay
a
finger
on
you.
I’ll
just
save
you
for
the
Qohorik,
yes
I
will,
I’ll
save
you
for
the
Crippler.
Vargo
Hoat
his
name
is,
and
when
he
gets
back
he’ll
cut
off
your
feet.”
Maybe
if
Weese
were
dead,
Arya
thought…
but
not
when
she
was
with
him.
He
could
look
at
you
and
smell
what
you
were
thinking,
he
always
said
so.

Weese
never
imagined
she
could
read,
though,
so
he
never
bothered
to
seal
the
messages
he
gave
her.
Arya
peeked
at
them
all,
but
they
were
never
anything
good,
just
stupid
stuff
sending
this
cart
to
the
granary
and
that
one
to
the
armory.
One
was
a
demand
for
payment
on
a
gambling
debt,
but
the
knight
she
gave
it
to
couldn’t
read.
When
she
told
him
what
it
said
he
tried
to
hit
her,
but
Arya
ducked
under
the
blow,
snatched
a
silver-banded
drinking
horn
off
his
saddle,
and
darted
away.
The
knight
roared
and
came
after
her,
but
she
slid
between
two
wayns,
wove
through
a
crowd
of
archers,
and
jumped
a
latrine
trench.
In
his
mail
he
couldn’t
keep
up.
When
she
gave
the
horn
to
Weese,
he
told
her
that
a
smart
little
Weasel
like
her
deserved
a
reward.
“I’ve
got
my
eye
on
a
plump
crisp
capon
to
sup
on
tonight.
We’ll
share
it,
me
and
you.
You’ll
like
that.”

Everywhere
she
went,
Arya
searched
for
Jaqen
H’ghar,
wanting
to
whisper
another
name
to
him
before
those
she
hated
were
all
gone
out
of
her
reach,
but
amidst
the
chaos
and
confusion
the
Lorathi
sellsword
was
not
to
be
found.
He
still
owed
her
two
deaths,
and
she
was
worried
she
would
never
get
them
if
he
rode
off
to
battle
with
the
rest.
Finally
she
worked
up
the
courage
to
ask
one
of
the
gate
guards
if
he’d
gone.
“One
of
Lorch’s
men,
is
he?”
the
man
said.
“He
won’t
be
going,
then.
His
lordship’s
named
Ser
Amory
castellan
of
Harrenhal.
That
whole
lot’s
staying
right
here,
to
hold
the
castle.
The
Bloody
Mummers
will
be
left
as
well,
to
do
the
foraging.
That
goat
Vargo
Hoat
is
like
to
spit,
him
and
Lorch
have
always
hated
each
other.”

The
Mountain
would
be
leaving
with
Lord
Tywin,
though.
He
would
command
the
van
in
battle,
which
meant
that
Dunsen,
Polliver,
and
Raff
would
all
slip
between
her
fingers
unless
she
could
find
Jaqen
and
have
him
kill
one
of
them
before
they
left.

“Weasel,”
Weese
said
that
afternoon.
“Get
to
the
armory
and
tell
Lucan
that
Ser
Lyonel
notched
his
sword
in
practice
and
needs
a
new
one.
Here’s
his
mark.”
He
handed
her
a
square
of
paper.
“Be
quick
about
it
now,
he’s
to
ride
with
Ser
Kevan
Lannister.”

Arya
took
the
paper
and
ran.
The
armory
adjoined
the
castle
smithy,
a
long
high-roofed
tunnel
of
a
building
with
twenty
forges
built
into
its
walls
and
long
stone
water
troughs
for
tempering
the
steel.
Half
of
the
forges
were
at
work
when
she
entered.
The
walls
rang
with
the
sound
of
hammers,
and
burly
men
in
leather
aprons
stood
sweating
in
the
sullen
heat
as
they
bent
over
bellows
and
anvils.
When
she
spied
Gendry,
his
bare
chest
was
slick
with
sweat,
but
the
blue
eyes
under
the
heavy
black
hair
had
the
stubborn
look
she
remembered.
Arya
didn’t
know
that
she
even
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
It
was
his
fault
they’d
all
been
caught.
“Which
one
is
Lucan?”
She
thrust
out
the
paper.
“I’m
to
get
a
new
sword
for
Ser
Lyonel.”

“Never
mind
about
Ser
Lyonel.”
He
drew
her
aside
by
the
arm.
“Last
night
Hot
Pie
asked
me
if
I
heard
you
yell
Winterfell
back
at
the
holdfast,
when
we
were
all
fighting
on
the
wall.”

“I
never
did!”

“Yes
you
did.
I
heard
you
too.”

“Everyone
was
yelling
stuff,”
Arya
said
defensively.
“Hot
Pie
yelled
hot
pie.
He
must
have
yelled
it
a
hundred
times.”

“It’s
what
you
yelled
that
matters.
I
told
Hot
Pie
he
should
clean
the
wax
out
of
his
ears,
that
all
you
yelled
was
Go
to
hell!
If
he
asks
you,
you
better
say
the
same.”

“I
will,”
she
said,
even
though
she
thought
go
to
hell
was
a
stupid
thing
to
yell.
She
didn’t
dare
tell
Hot
Pie
who
she
really
was.
Maybe
I
should
say
Hot
Pie’s
name
to
Jaqen.

“I’ll
get
Lucan,”
Gendry
said.

Lucan
grunted
at
the
writing
(though
Arya
did
not
think
he
could
read
it),
and
pulled
down
a
heavy
longsword.
“This
is
too
good
for
that
oaf,
and
you
tell
him
I
said
so,”
he
said
as
he
gave
her
the
blade.

“I
will,”
she
lied.
If
she
did
any
such
thing,
Weese
would
beat
her
bloody.
Lucan
could
deliver
his
own
insults.

The
longsword
was
a
lot
heavier
than
Needle
had
been,
but
Arya
liked
the
feel
of
it.
The
weight
of
steel
in
her
hands
made
her
feel
stronger.
Maybe
I’m
not
a
water
dancer
yet,
but
I’m
not
a
mouse
either.
A
mouse
couldn’t
use
a
sword
but
I
can.
The
gates
were
open,
soldiers
coming
and
going,
drays
rolling
in
empty
and
going
out
creaking
and
swaying
under
their
loads.
She
thought
about
going
to
the
stables
and
telling
them
that
Ser
Lyonel
wanted
a
new
horse.
She
had
the
paper,
the
stableboys
wouldn’t
be
able
to
read
it
any
better
than
Lucan
had.
I
could
take
the
horse
and
the
sword
and
just
ride
out.
If
the
guards
tried
to
stop
me
I’d
show
them
the
paper
and
say
I
was
bringing
everything
to
Ser
Lyonel.
She
had
no
notion
what
Ser
Lyonel
looked
like
or
where
to
find
him,
though.
If
they
questioned
her,
they’d
know,
and
then
Weese…
Weese…

As
she
chewed
her
lip,
trying
not
to
think
about
how
it
would
feel
to
have
her
feet
cut
off,
a
group
of
archers
in
leather
jerkins
and
iron
helms
went
past,
their
bows
slung
across
their
shoulders.
Arya
heard
snatches
of
their
talk.

“…giants
I
tell
you,
he’s
got
giants
twenty
foot
tall
come
down
from
beyond
the
Wall,
follow
him
like
dogs…”

“…not
natural,
coming
on
them
so
fast,
in
the
night
and
all.
He’s
more
wolf
than
man,
all
them
Starks
are…”

“…shit
on
your
wolves
and
giants,
the
boy’d
piss
his
pants
if
he
knew
we
was
coming.
He
wasn’t
man
enough
to
march
on
Harrenhal,
was
he?
Ran
t’other
way,
didn’t
he?
He’d
run
now
if
he
knew
what
was
best
for
him.”

“So
you
say,
but
might
be
the
boy
knows
something
we
don’t,
maybe
it’s
us
ought
to
be
run…”

Yes,
Arya
thought.
Yes,
it’s
you
who
ought
to
run,
you
and
Lord
Tywin
and
the
Mountain
and
Ser
Addam
and
Ser
Amory
and
stupid
Ser
Lyonel
whoever
he
is,
all
of
you
better
run
or
my
brother
will
kill
you,
he’s
a
Stark,
he’s
more
wolf
than
man,
and
so
am
I.

“Weasel.”
Weese’s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip.
She
never
saw
where
he
came
from,
but
suddenly
he
was
right
in
front
of
her.
“Give
me
that.
Took
you
long
enough.”
He
snatched
the
sword
from
her
fingers,
and
dealt
her
a
stinging
slap
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Next
time
be
quicker
about
it.”

For
a
moment
she
had
been
a
wolf
again,
but
Weese’s
slap
took
it
all
away
and
left
her
with
nothing
but
the
taste
of
her
own
blood
in
her
mouth.
She’d
bitten
her
tongue
when
he
hit
her.
She
hated
him
for
that.

“You
want
another?”
Weese
demanded.
“You’ll
get
it
too.
I’ll
have
none
of
your
insolent
looks.
Get
down
to
the
brewhouse
and
tell
Tuffleberry
that
I
have
two
dozen
barrels
for
him,
but
he
better
send
his
lads
to
fetch
them
or
I’ll
find
someone
wants
’em
worse.”
Arya
started
off,
but
not
quick
enough
for
Weese.
“You
run
if
you
want
to
eat
tonight,”
he
shouted,
his
promises
of
a
plump
crisp
capon
already
forgotten.
“And
don’t
be
getting
lost
again,
or
I
swear
I’ll
beat
you
bloody.”

You
won’t,
Arya
thought.
You
won’t
ever
again.
But
she
ran.
The
old
gods
of
the
north
must
have
been
guiding
her
steps.
Halfway
to
the
brewhouse,
as
she
passing
under
the
stone
bridge
that
arched
between
Widow’s
Tower
and
Kingspyre,
she
heard
harsh,
growling
laughter.
Rorge
came
around
a
corner
with
three
other
men,
the
manticore
badge
of
Ser
Amory
sewn
over
their
hearts.
When
he
saw
her,
he
stopped
and
grinned,
showing
a
mouthful
of
crooked
brown
teeth
under
the
leather
flap
he
wore
sometimes
to
cover
the
hole
in
his
face.
“Yoren’s
little
cunt,”
he
called
her.
“Guess
we
know
why
that
black
bastard
wanted
you
on
the
Wall,
don’t
we?”
He
laughed
again,
and
the
others
laughed
with
him.
“Where’s
your
stick
now?”
Rorge
demanded
suddenly,
the
smile
gone
as
quick
as
it
had
come.
“Seems
to
me
I
promised
to
fuck
you
with
it.”
He
took
a
step
toward
her.
Arya
edged
backward.
“Not
so
brave
now
that
I’m
not
in
chains,
are
you?”

“I
saved
you.”
She
kept
a
good
yard
between
them,
ready
to
run
quick
as
a
snake
if
he
made
a
grab
for
her.

“Owe
you
another
fucking
for
that,
seems
like.
Did
Yoren
pump
your
cunny,
or
did
he
like
that
tight
little
ass
better?”

“I’m
looking
for
Jaqen,”
she
said.
“There’s
a
message.”

Rorge
halted.
Something
in
his
eyes…
could
it
be
that
he
was
scared
of
Jaqen
H’ghar?
“The
bathhouse.
Get
out
of
my
way.”

Arya
whirled
and
ran,
swift
as
a
deer,
her
feet
flying
over
the
cobbles
all
the
way
to
the
bathhouse,
She
found
Jaqen
soaking
in
a
tub,
steam
rising
around
him
as
a
serving
girl
sluiced
hot
water
over
his
head.
His
long
hair,
red
on
one
side
and
white
on
the
other,
fell
down
across
his
shoulders,
wet
and
heavy.

She
crept
up
quiet
as
a
shadow,
but
he
opened
his
eyes
all
the
same.
“She
steals
in
on
little
mice
feet,
but
a
man
hears,”
he
said.
How
could
he
hear
me?
she
wondered,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
heard
that
as
well.
“The
scuff
of
leather
on
stone
sings
loud
as
warhorns
to
a
man
with
open
ears.
Clever
girls
go
barefoot.”

“I
have
a
message.”
Arya
eyed
the
serving
girl
uncertainly.
When
she
did
not
seem
likely
to
go
away,
she
leaned
in
until
her
mouth
was
almost
touching
his
ear.
“Weese,”
she
whispered.

Jaqen
H’ghar
closed
his
eyes
again,
floating
languid,
half-asleep.
“Tell
his
lordship
a
man
shall
attend
him
at
his
leisure.”
His
hand
moved
suddenly,
splashing
hot
water
at
her,
and
Arya
had
to
leap
back
to
keep
from
getting
drenched.

When
she
told
Tuffleberry
what
Weese
had
said,
the
brewer
cursed
loudly.
“You
tell
Weese
my
lads
got
duties
to
attend
to,
and
you
tell
him
he’s
a
pox-ridden
bastard
too,
and
the
seven
hells
will
freeze
over
before
he
gets
another
horn
of
my
ale.
I’ll
have
them
barrels
within
the
hour
or
Lord
Tywin
will
hear
of
it,
see
if
he
don’t.”

Weese
cursed
too
when
Arya
brought
back
that
message,
even
though
she
left
out
the
pox-ridden
bastard
part.
He
fumed
and
threatened,
but
in
the
end
he
rounded
up
six
men
and
sent
them
off
grumbling
to
fetch
the
barrels
down
to
the
brewhouse.

Supper
that
evening
was
a
thin
stew
of
barley,
onion,
and
carrots,
with
a
wedge
of
stale
brown
bread.
One
of
the
women
had
taken
to
sleeping
in
Weese’s
bed,
and
she
got
a
piece
of
ripe
blue
cheese
as
well,
and
a
wing
off
the
capon
that
Weese
had
spoken
of
that
morning.
He
ate
the
rest
himself,
the
grease
running
down
in
a
shiny
line
through
the
boils
that
festered
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth.
The
bird
was
almost
gone
when
he
glanced
up
from
his
trencher
and
saw
Arya
staring.
“Weasel,
come
here.”

A
few
mouthfuls
of
dark
meat
still
clung
to
one
thigh.
He
forgot,
but
now
he’s
remembered,
Arya
thought.
It
made
her
feel
bad
for
telling
Jaqen
to
kill
him.
She
got
off
the
bench
and
went
to
the
head
of
the
table.

“I
saw
you
looking
at
me.”
Weese
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
front
of
her
shift.
Then
he
grabbed
her
throat
with
one
hand
and
slapped
her
with
the
other.
“What
did
I
tell
you?”
He
slapped
her
again,
backhand.
“Keep
those
eyes
to
yourself,
or
next
time
I’ll
spoon
one
out
and
feed
it
to
my
bitch.”
A
shove
sent
her
stumbling
to
the
floor.
Her
hem
caught
on
a
loose
nail
in
the
splintered
wooden
bench
and
ripped
as
she
fell.
“You’ll
mend
that
before
you
sleep,”
Weese
announced
as
he
pulled
the
last
bit
of
meat
off
the
capon.
When
he
was
finished
he
sucked
his
fingers
noisily,
and
threw
the
bones
to
his
ugly
spotted
dog.

“Weese,”
Arya
whispered
that
night
as
she
bent
over
the
tear
in
her
shift.
“Dunsen,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling,”
she
said,
calling
a
name
every
time
she
pushed
the
bone
needle
through
the
undyed
wool.
“The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.”
She
wondered
how
much
longer
she
would
have
to
include
Weese
in
her
prayer,
and
drifted
off
to
sleep
dreaming
that
on
the
morrow,
when
she
woke,
he’d
be
dead.

But
it
was
the
sharp
toe
of
Weese’s
boot
that
woke
her,
as
ever.
The
main
strength
of
Lord
Tywin’s
host
would
ride
this
day,
he
told
them
as
they
broke
their
fast
on
oatcakes.
“Don’t
none
of
you
be
thinking
how
easy
it’ll
be
here
once
m’lord
of
Lannister
is
gone,”
he
warned.
“The
castle
won’t
grow
no
smaller,
I
promise
you
that,
only
now
there’ll
be
fewer
hands
to
tend
to
it.
You
lot
of
slugabeds
are
going
to
learn
what
work
is
now,
yes
you
are.”

Not
from
you.
Arya
picked
at
her
oaten
cake.
Weese
frowned
at
her,
as
if
he
smelled
her
secret.
Quickly
she
dropped
her
gaze
to
her
food,
and
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
again.

Pale
light
filled
the
yard
when
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
took
his
leave
of
Harrenhal.
Arya
watched
from
an
arched
window
halfway
up
the
Wailing
Tower.
His
charger
wore
a
blanket
of
enameled
crimson
scales
and
gilded
crinet
and
chamfron,
while
Lord
Tywin
himself
sported
a
thick
ermine
cloak.
His
brother
Ser
Kevan
looked
near
as
splendid.
No
less
than
four
standard-bearers
went
before
them,
carrying
huge
crimson
banners
emblazoned
with
the
golden
lion.
Behind
the
Lannisters
came
their
great
lords
and
captains.
Their
banners
flared
and
flapped,
a
pageant
of
color:
red
ox
and
golden
mountain,
purple
unicorn
and
bantam
rooster,
brindled
boar
and
badger,
a
silver
ferret
and
a
juggler
in
motley,
stars
and
sunbursts,
peacock
and
panther,
chevron
and
dagger,
black
hood
and
blue
beetle
and
green
arrow.

Last
of
all
came
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
in
his
grey
plate
steel,
astride
a
stallion
as
bad-tempered
as
his
rider.
Polliver
rode
beside
him,
with
the
black
dog
standard
in
his
hand
and
Gendry’s
horned
helm
on
his
head.
He
was
a
tall
man,
but
he
looked
no
more
than
a
half-grown
boy
when
he
rode
in
his
master’s
shadow.

A
shiver
crept
up
Arya’s
spine
as
she
watched
them
pass
under
the
great
iron
portcullis
of
Harrenhal.
Suddenly
she
knew
that
she
had
made
a
terrible
mistake.
I’m
so
stupid,
she
thought.
Weese
did
not
matter,
no
more
than
Chiswyck
had.
These
were
the
men
who
mattered,
the
ones
she
ought
to
have
killed.
Last
night
she
could
have
whispered
any
of
them
dead,
if
only
she
hadn’t
been
so
mad
at
Weese
for
hitting
her
and
lying
about
the
capon.
Lord
Tywin,
why
didn’t
I
say
Lord
Tywin?

Perhaps
it
was
not
too
late
to
change
her
mind.
Weese
was
not
killed
yet.
If
she
could
find
Jaqen,
tell
him…

Hurriedly,
Arya
ran
down
the
twisting
steps,
her
chores
forgotten.
She
heard
the
rattle
of
chains
as
the
portcullis
was
slowly
lowered,
its
spikes
sinking
deep
into
the
ground…
and
then
another
sound,
a
shriek
of
pain
and
fear.

A
dozen
people
got
there
before
her,
though
none
was
coming
any
too
close.
Arya
squirmed
between
them.
Weese
was
sprawled
across
the
cobbles,
his
throat
a
red
ruin,
eyes
gaping
sightlessly
up
at
a
bank
of
grey
cloud.
His
ugly
spotted
dog
stood
on
his
chest,
lapping
at
the
blood
pulsing
from
his
neck,
and
every
so
often
ripping
a
mouthful
of
flesh
out
of
the
dead
man’s
face.

Finally
someone
brought
a
crossbow
and
shot
the
spotted
dog
dead
while
she
was
worrying
at
one
of
Weese’s
ears.

“Damnedest
thing,”
she
heard
a
man
say.
“He
had
that
bitch
dog
since
she
was
a
pup.”

“This
place
is
cursed,”
the
man
with
the
crossbow
said.

“It’s
Harren’s
ghost,
that’s
what
it
is,”
said
Goodwife
Amabel.
“I’ll
not
sleep
here
another
night,
I
swear
it.”

Arya
lifted
her
gaze
from
the
dead
man
and
his
dead
dog.
Jaqen
H’ghar
was
leaning
up
against
the
side
of
the
Wailing
Tower.
When
he
saw
her
looking,
he
lifted
a
hand
to
his
face
and
laid
two
fingers
casually
against
his
cheek.





CATELYN

Two
days
ride
from
Riverrun,
a
scout
spied
them
watering
their
horses
beside
a
muddy
steam.
Catelyn
had
never
been
so
glad
to
see
the
twin
tower
badge
of
House
Frey.

When
she
asked
him
to
lead
them
to
her
uncle,
he
said,
“The
Blackfish
is
gone
west
with
the
king,
my
lady.
Martyn
Rivers
commands
the
outriders
in
his
stead.”

“I
see.”
She
had
met
Rivers
at
the
Twins;
a
baseborn
son
of
Lord
Walder
Frey,
half
brother
to
Ser
Perwyn.
It
did
not
surprise
her
to
learn
that
Robb
had
struck
at
the
heart
of
Lannister
power;
clearly
he
had
been
contemplating
just
that
when
he
sent
her
away
to
treat
with
Renly.
“Where
is
Rivers
now?”

“His
camp
is
two
hours
ride,
my
lady.”

“Take
us
to
him,”
she
commanded.
Brienne
helped
her
back
into
her
saddle,
and
they
set
out
at
once.

“Have
you
come
from
Bitterbridge,
my
lady?”
the
scout
asked.

“No.”
She
had
not
dared.
With
Renly
dead,
Catelyn
had
been
uncertain
of
the
reception
she
might
receive
from
his
young
widow
and
her
protectors.
Instead
she
had
ridden
through
the
heart
of
the
war,
through
fertile
riverlands
turned
to
blackened
desert
by
the
fury
of
the
Lannisters,
and
each
night
her
scouts
brought
back
tales
that
made
her
ill.
“Lord
Renly
is
slain,”
she
added.

“We’d
hoped
that
tale
was
some
Lannister
lie,
or—”

“Would
that
it
were.
My
brother
commands
in
Riverrun?”

“Yes,
my
lady.
His
Grace
left
Ser
Edmure
to
hold
Riverrun
and
guard
his
rear.”

Gods
grant
him
the
strength
to
do
so,
Catelyn
thought.
And
the
wisdom
as
well.
“Is
there
word
from
Robb
in
the
west?”

“You
have
not
heard?”
The
man
seemed
surprised.
“His
Grace
won
a
great
victory
at
Oxcross.
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
is
dead,
his
host
scattered.”

Ser
Wendel
Manderly
gave
a
whoop
of
pleasure,
but
Catelyn
only
nodded.
Tomorrow’s
trials
concerned
her
more
than
yesterday’s
triumphs.

Martyn
Rivers
had
made
his
camp
in
the
shell
of
a
shattered
holdfast,
beside
a
roofless
stable
and
a
hundred
fresh
graves.
He
went
to
one
knee
when
Catelyn
dismounted.
“Well
met,
my
lady.
Your
brother
charged
us
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
your
party,
and
escort
you
back
to
Riverrun
in
all
haste
should
we
come
upon
you.”

Catelyn
scarce
liked
the
sound
of
that.
“Is
it
my
father?”

“No,
my
lady.
Lord
Hoster
is
unchanged.”
Rivers
was
a
ruddy
man
with
scant
resemblance
to
his
half
brothers.
“It
is
only
that
we
feared
you
might
chance
upon
Lannister
scouts.
Lord
Tywin
has
left
Harrenhal
and
marches
west
with
all
his
power.”

“Rise,”
she
told
Rivers,
frowning.
Stannis
Baratheon
would
soon
be
on
the
march
as
well,
gods
help
them
all.
“How
long
until
Lord
Tywin
is
upon
us?”

“Three
days,
perhaps
four,
it
is
hard
to
know.
We
have
eyes
out
along
all
the
roads,
but
it
would
be
best
not
to
linger.”

Nor
did
they.
Rivers
broke
his
camp
quickly
and
saddled
up
beside
her,
and
they
set
off
again,
near
fifty
strong
now,
flying
beneath
the
direwolf,
the
leaping
trout,
the
twin
towers.

Her
men
wanted
to
hear
more
of
Robb’s
victory
at
Oxcross,
and
Rivers
obliged.
“There’s
a
singer
come
to
Riverrun,
calls
himself
Rymund
the
Rhymer,
he’s
made
a
song
of
the
fight.
Doubtless
you’ll
hear
it
sung
tonight,
my
lady.
‘Wolf
in
the
Night’
this
Rymund
calls
it.”
He
went
on
to
tell
how
the
remnants
of
Ser
Stafford’s
host
had
fallen
back
on
Lannisport.
Without
siege
engines
there
was
no
way
to
storm
Casterly
Rock,
so
the
Young
Wolf
was
paying
the
Lannisters
back
in
kind
for
the
devastation
they’d
inflicted
on
the
riverlands.
Lords
Karstark
and
Glover
were
raiding
along
the
coast,
Lady
Mormont
had
captured
thousands
of
cattle
and
was
driving
them
back
toward
Riverrun,
while
the
Greatjon
had
seized
the
gold
mines
at
Castamere,
Nunn’s
Deep,
and
the
Pendric
Hills.
Ser
Wendel
laughed.
“Nothing’s
more
like
to
bring
a
Lannister
running
than
a
threat
to
his
gold.”

“How
did
the
king
ever
take
the
Tooth?”
Ser
Perwyn
Frey
asked
his
bastard
brother.
“That’s
a
hard
strong
keep,
and
it
commands
the
hill
road.”

“He
never
took
it.
He
slipped
around
it
in
the
night.
It’s
said
the
direwolf
showed
him
the
way,
that
Grey
Wind
of
his.
The
beast
sniffed
out
a
goat
track
that
wound
down
a
defile
and
up
along
beneath
a
ridge,
a
crooked
and
stony
way,
yet
wide
enough
for
men
riding
single
file.
The
Lannisters
in
their
watchtowers
got
not
so
much
a
glimpse
of
them.”
Rivers
lowered
his
voice.
“There’s
some
say
that
after
the
battle,
the
king
cut
out
Stafford
Lannister’s
heart
and
fed
it
to
the
wolf.”

“I
would
not
believe
such
tales,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“My
son
is
no
savage.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady.
Still,
it’s
no
more
than
the
beast
deserved.
That
is
no
common
wolf,
that
one.
The
Greatjon’s
been
heard
to
say
that
the
old
gods
of
the
north
sent
those
direwolves
to
your
children.”

Catelyn
remembered
the
day
when
her
boys
had
found
the
pups
in
the
late
summer
snows.
There
had
been
five,
three
male
and
two
female
for
the
five
trueborn
children
of
House
Stark…
and
a
sixth,
white
of
fur
and
red
of
eye,
for
Ned’s
bastard
son
Jon
Snow.
No
common
wolves,
she
thought.
No
indeed.

That
night
as
they
made
their
camp,
Brienne
sought
out
her
tent.
“My
lady,
you
are
safely
back
among
your
own
now,
a
day’s
ride
from
your
brother’s
castle.
Give
me
leave
to
go.”

Catelyn
should
not
have
been
surprised.
The
homely
young
woman
had
kept
to
herself
all
through
their
journey,
spending
most
of
her
time
with
the
horses,
brushing
out
their
coats
and
pulling
stones
from
their
shoes.
She
had
helped
Shadd
cook
and
clean
game
as
well,
and
soon
proved
that
she
could
hunt
as
well
as
any.
Any
task
Catelyn
asked
her
to
turn
her
hand
to,
Brienne
had
performed
deftly
and
without
complaint,
and
when
she
was
spoken
to
she
answered
politely,
but
she
never
chattered,
nor
wept,
nor
laughed.
She
had
ridden
with
them
every
day
and
slept
among
them
every
night
without
ever
truly
becoming
one
of
them.

It
was
the
same
when
she
was
with
Renly,
Catelyn
thought.
At
the
feast,
in
the
melee,
even
in
Renly’s
pavilion
with
her
brothers
of
the
Rainbow
Guard.
There
are
walls
around
this
one
higher
than
Winterfell’s.

“If
you
left
us,
where
would
you
go?”
Catelyn
asked
her.

“Back,”
Brienne
said.
“To
Storm’s
End.”

“Alone.”
It
was
not
a
question.

The
broad
face
was
a
pool
of
still
water,
giving
no
hint
of
what
might
live
in
the
depths
below.
“Yes.”

“You
mean
to
kill
Stannis.”

Brienne
closed
her
thick
callused
fingers
around
the
hilt
of
her
sword.

The
sword
that
had
been
his.
“I
swore
a
vow.
Three
times
I
swore.
You
heard
me.”

“I
did,”
Catelyn
admitted.
The
girl
had
kept
the
rainbow
cloak
when
she
discarded
the
rest
of
her
bloodstained
clothing,
she
knew.
Brienne’s
own
things
had
been
left
behind
during
their
flight,
and
she
had
been
forced
to
clothe
herself
in
odd
bits
of
Ser
Wendel’s
spare
garb,
since
no
one
else
in
their
party
had
garments
large
enough
to
fit
her.
“Vows
should
be
kept,
I
agree,
but
Stannis
has
a
great
host
around
him,
and
his
own
guards
sworn
to
keep
him
safe.”

“I
am
not
afraid
of
his
guards.
I
am
as
good
as
any
of
them.
I
should
never
have
fled.”

“Is
that
what
troubles
you,
that
some
fool
might
call
you
craven?”
She
sighed.
“Renly’s
death
was
no
fault
of
youts.
You
served
him
valiantly,
but
when
you
seek
to
follow
him
into
the
earth,
you
serve
no
one.”
She
stretched
out
a
hand,
to
give
what
comfort
a
touch
could
give.
“I
know
how
hard
it
is—”

Brienne
shook
off
her
hand.
“No
one
knows.”

“You’re
wrong,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“Every
morning,
when
I
wake,
I
remember
that
Ned
is
gone.
I
have
no
skill
with
swords,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
I
do
not
dream
of
riding
to
King’s
Landing
and
wrapping
my
hands
around
Cersei
Lannister’s
white
throat
and
squeezing
until
her
face
turns
black.”

The
Beauty
raised
her
eyes,
the
only
part
of
her
that
was
truly
beautiful.
“If
you
dream
that,
why
would
you
seek
to
hold
me
back?
Is
it
because
of
what
Stannis
said
at
the
parley?”

Was
it?
Catelyn
glanced
across
the
camp.
Two
men
were
walking
sentry,
spears
in
hand.
“I
was
taught
that
good
men
must
fight
evil
in
this
world,
and
Renly’s
death
was
evil
beyond
all
doubt.
Yet
I
was
also
taught
that
the
gods
make
kings,
not
the
swords
of
men.
If
Stannis
is
our
rightful
king—”

“He’s
not.
Robert
was
never
the
rightful
king
either,
even
Renly
said
as
much.
Jaime
Lannister
murdered
the
rightful
king,
after
Robert
killed
his
lawful
heir
on
the
Trident.
Where
were
the
gods
then?
The
gods
don’t
care
about
men,
no
more
than
kings
care
about
peasants.”

“A
good
king
does
care.”

“Lord
Renly…
His
Grace,
he…
he
would
have
been
the
best
king,
my
lady,
he
was
so
good,
he…”

“He
is
gone,
Brienne,”
she
said,
as
gently
as
she
could.
“Stannis
and
Joffrey
remain…
and
so
does
my
son.”

“He
wouldn’t…
you’d
never
make
a
peace
with
Stannis,
would
you?
Bend
the
knee?
You
wouldn’t…”

“I
will
tell
you
true,
Brienne.
I
do
not
know.
My
son
may
be
a
king,
but
I
am
no
queen…
only
a
mother
who
would
keep
her
children
safe,
however
she
could.”

“I
am
not
made
to
be
a
mother.
I
need
to
fight.”

“Then
fight…
but
for
the
living,
not
the
dead.
Renly’s
enemies
are
Robb’s
enemies
as
well.”

Brienne
stared
at
the
ground
and
shuffled
her
feet.
“I
do
not
know
your
son,
my
lady.”
She
looked
up.
“I
could
serve
you.
If
you
would
have
me.”

Catelyn
was
startled.
“Why
me?”

The
question
seemed
to
trouble
Brienne.
“You
helped
me.
In
the
pavilion…
when
they
thought
that
I
had…
that
I
had…”

“You
were
innocent.”

“Even
so,
you
did
not
have
to
do
that.
You
could
have
let
them
kill
me.
I
was
nothing
to
you.”

Perhaps
I
did
not
want
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
the
dark
truth
of
what
had
happened
there,
Catelyn
thought.
“Brienne,
I
have
taken
many
wellborn
ladies
into
my
service
over
the
years,
but
never
one
like
you.
I
am
no
battle
commander.”

“No,
but
you
have
courage.
Not
battle
courage
perhaps
but…
I
don’t
know…
a
kind
of
woman’s
courage.
And
I
think,
when
the
time
comes,
you
will
not
try
and
hold
me
back.
Promise
me
that.
That
you
will
not
hold
me
back
from
Stannis.”

Catelyn
could
still
hear
Stannis
saying
that
Robb’s
turn
too
would
come
in
time.
It
was
like
a
cold
breath
on
the
back
of
her
neck.
“When
the
time
comes,
I
will
not
hold
you
back.”

The
tall
girl
knelt
awkwardly,
unsheathed
Renly’s
longsword,
and
laid
it
at
her
feet.
“Then
I
am
yours,
my
lady.
Your
liege
man,
or…
whatever
you
would
have
me
be.
I
will
shield
your
back
and
keep
your
counsel
and
give
my
life
for
yours,
if
need
be.
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.”

“And
I
vow
that
you
shall
always
have
a
place
by
my
hearth
and
meat
and
mead
at
my
table,
and
pledge
to
ask
no
service
of
you
that
might
bring
you
into
dishonor.
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.
Arise.”
As
she
clasped
the
other
woman’s
hands
between
her
own,
Catelyn
could
not
help
but
smile.
How
many
times
did
I
watch
Ned
accept
a
man’s
oath
of
service?
She
wondered
what
he
would
think
if
he
could
see
her
now.

They
forded
the
Red
Fork
late
the
next
day,
upstream
of
Riverrun
where
the
river
made
a
wide
loop
and
the
waters
grew
muddy
and
shallow.
The
crossing
was
guarded
by
a
mixed
force
of
archers
and
pikemen
wearing
the
eagle
badge
of
the
Mallisters.
When
they
saw
Catelyn’s
banners,
they
emerged
from
behind
their
sharpened
stakes
and
sent
a
man
over
from
the
far
bank
to
lead
her
party
across.
“Slow
and
careful
like,
milady,”
he
warned
as
he
took
the
bridle
of
her
horse.
“We’ve
planted
iron
spikes
under
the
water,
y’see,
and
there’s
caltrops
scattered
among
them
rocks
there.
It’s
the
same
on
all
the
fords,
by
your
brother’s
command.”

Edmure
thinks
to
fight
here.
The
realization
gave
her
a
queasy
feeling
in
the
bowels,
but
she
held
her
tongue.

Between
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone,
they
joined
a
stream
of
smallfolk
making
for
the
safety
of
Riverrun.
Some
were
driving
animals
before
them,
others
pulling
wayns,
but
they
made
way
as
Catelyn
rode
past,
and
cheered
her
with
cries
of
“Tully!”
or
“Stark!”
Half
a
mile
from
the
castle,
she
passed
through
a
large
encampment
where
the
scarlet
banner
of
the
Blackwoods
waved
above
the
lord’s
tent.
Lucas
took
his
leave
of
her
there,
to
seek
out
his
father,
Lord
Tytos.
The
rest
rode
on.

Catelyn
spied
a
second
camp
strung
out
along
the
bank
north
of
the
Tumblestone,
familiar
standards
flapping
in
the
wind—Marq
Piper’s
dancing
maiden,
Darry’s
plowman,
the
twining
red-and-white
snakes
of
the
Paeges.
They
were
all
her
father’s
bannermen,
lords
of
the
Trident.
Most
had
left
Riverrun
before
she
had,
to
defend
their
own
lands.
If
they
were
here
again,
it
could
only
mean
that
Edmure
had
called
them
back.
Gods
save
us,
it’s
true,
he
means
to
offer
battle
to
Lord
Tywin.

Something
dark
was
dangling
against
the
walls
of
Riverrun,
Catelyn
saw
from
a
distance.
When
she
rode
close,
she
saw
dead
men
hanging
from
the
battlements,
slumped
at
the
ends
of
long
ropes
with
hempen
nooses
tight
around
their
necks,
their
faces
swollen
and
black.
The
crows
had
been
at
them,
but
their
crimson
cloaks
still
showed
bright
against
the
sandstone
walls.

“They
have
hanged
some
Lannisters,”
Hal
Mollen
observed.

“A
pretty
sight,”
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
said
cheerfully.

“Our
friends
have
begun
without
us,”
Perwyn
Frey
jested.
The
others
laughed,
all
but
Brienne,
who
gazed
up
at
the
row
of
bodies
unblinking,
and
neither
spoke
nor
smiled.

If
they
have
slain
the
Kingslayer,
then
my
daughters
are
dead
as
well.
Catelyn
spurred
her
horse
to
a
canter.
Hal
Mollen
and
Robin
Flint
raced
past
at
a
gallop,
halooing
to
the
gatehouse.
The
guards
on
the
walls
had
doubtless
spied
her
banners
some
time
ago,
for
the
portcullis
was
up
as
they
approached.

Edmure
rode
out
from
the
castle
to
meet
her,
surrounded
by
three
of
her
father’s
sworn
men—great-bellied
Ser
Desmond
Grell
the
master-at-arms,
Utherydes
Wayn
the
steward,
and
Ser
Robin
Ryger,
Riverrun’s
big
bald
captain
of
guards.
They
were
all
three
of
an
age
with
Lord
Hoster,
men
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
her
father’s
service.
Old
men,
Catelyn
realized.

Edmure
wore
a
blue-and-red
cloak
over
a
tunic
embroidered
with
silver
fish.
From
the
look
of
him,
he
had
not
shaved
since
she
rode
south;
his
beard
was
a
fiery
bush.
“Cat,
it
is
good
to
have
you
safely
back.
When
we
heard
of
Renly’s
death,
we
feared
for
your
life.
And
Lord
Tywin
is
on
the
march
as
well.”

“So
I
am
told.
How
fares
our
father?”

“One
day
he
seems
stronger,
the
next…”
He
shook
his
head.
“He’s
asked
for
you.
I
did
not
know
what
to
tell
him.”

“I
will
go
to
him
soon,”
she
vowed.
“Has
there
been
word
from
Storm’s
End
since
Renly
died?
Or
from
Bitterbridge?”
No
ravens
came
to
men
on
the
road,
and
Catelyn
was
anxious
to
know
what
had
happened
behind
her.

“Nothing
from
Bitterbridge.
From
Storm’s
End,
three
birds
from
the
castellan,
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose,
all
carrying
the
same
plea.
Stannis
has
him
surrounded
by
land
and
sea.
He
offers
his
allegiance
to
whatsoever
king
will
break
the
siege.
He
fears
for
the
boy,
he
says.
What
boy
would
that
be,
do
you
know?”

“Edric
Storm,”
Brienne
told
them.
“Robert’s
bastard
son.”

Edmure
looked
at
her
curiously.
“Stannis
has
sworn
that
the
garrison
might
go
free,
unharmed,
provided
they
yield
the
castle
within
the
fortnight
and
deliver
the
boy
into
his
hands,
but
Ser
Cortnay
will
not
consent.”

He
risks
all
for
a
baseborn
boy
whose
blood
is
not
even
his
own,
Catelyn
thought.
“Did
you
send
him
an
answer?”

Edmure
shook
his
head.
“Why,
when
we
have
neither
help
nor
hope
to
offer?
And
Stannis
is
no
enemy
of
ours.”

Ser
Robin
Ryger
spoke.
“My
lady,
can
you
tell
us
the
manner
of
Lord
Renly’s
death?
The
tales
we’ve
heard
have
been
queer.”

“Cat,”
her
brother
said,
“some
say
you
killed
Renly.
Others
claim
it
was
some
southron
woman.”
His
glance
lingered
on
Brienne.

“My
king
was
murdered,”
the
girl
said
quietly,
“and
not
by
Lady
Catelyn.
I
swear
it
on
my
sword,
by
the
gods
old
and
new.”

“This
is
Brienne
of
Tarth,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Selwyn
the
Evenstar,
who
served
in
Renly’s
Rainbow
Guard,”
Catelyn
told
them.
“Brienne,
I
am
honored
to
acquaint
you
with
my
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
heir
to
Riverrun.
His
steward
Utherydes
Wayn.
Ser
Robin
Ryger
and
Ser
Desmond
Grell.”

“Honored,”
said
Ser
Desmond.
The
others
echoed
him.
The
girl
flushed,
embarrassed
even
at
this
commonplace
courtesy.
If
Edmure
thought
her
a
curious
sort
of
lady,
at
least
he
had
the
grace
not
to
say
so.

“Brienne
was
with
Renly
when
he
was
killed,
as
was
I,”
said
Catelyn,
“but
we
had
no
part
in
his
death.”
She
did
not
care
to
speak
of
the
shadow,
here
in
the
open
with
men
all
around,
so
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
bodies.
“Who
are
these
men
you’ve
hanged?”

Edmure
glanced
up
uncomfortably.
“They
came
with
Ser
Cleos
when
he
brought
the
queen’s
answer
to
our
peace
offer.”

Catelyn
was
shocked.
“You’ve
killed
envoys?”

“False
envoys,”
Edmure
declared.
“They
pledged
me
their
peace
and
surrendered
their
weapons,
so
I
allowed
them
freedom
of
the
castle,
and
for
three
nights
they
ate
my
meat
and
drank
my
mead
whilst
I
talked
with
Ser
Cleos.
On
the
fourth
night,
they
tried
to
free
the
Kingslayer.”
He
pointed
up.
“That
big
brute
killed
two
guards
with
naught
but
those
ham
hands
of
his,
caught
them
by
the
throats
and
smashed
their
skulls
together
while
that
skinny
lad
beside
him
was
opening
Lannister’s
cell
with
a
bit
of
wire,
gods
curse
him.
The
one
on
the
end
was
some
sort
of
damned
mummer.
He
used
my
own
voice
to
command
that
the
River
Gate
be
opened.
The
guardsmen
swear
to
it,
Enger
and
Delp
and
Long
Lew,
all
three.
If
you
ask
me,
the
man
sounded
nothing
like
me,
and
yet
the
oafs
were
raising
the
portcullis
all
the
same.”

This
was
the
Imp’s
work,
Catelyn
suspected;
it
stank
of
the
same
sort
of
cunning
he
had
displayed
at
the
Eyrie.
Once,
she
would
have
named
Tyrion
the
least
dangerous
of
the
Lannisters.
Now
she
was
not
so
certain.
“How
is
it
you
caught
them?”

“Ah,
as
it
happened,
I
was
not
in
the
castle.
I’d
crossed
the
Tumblestone
to,
ah…”

“You
were
whoring
or
wenching.
Get
on
with
the
tale.”

Edmure’s
cheeks
flamed
as
red
as
his
beard.
“It
was
the
hour
before
dawn,
and
I
was
only
then
returning.
When
Long
Lew
saw
my
boat
and
recognized
me,
he
finally
thought
to
wonder
who
was
standing
below
barking
commands,
and
raised
a
cry.”

“Tell
me
the
Kingslayer
was
retaken.”

“Yes,
though
not
easily.
Jaime
got
hold
of
a
sword,
slew
Poul
Pernford
and
Ser
Desmond’s
squire
Myles,
and
wounded
Delp
so
badly
that
Maester
Vyman
fears
he’ll
soon
die
as
well.
It
was
a
bloody
mess.
At
the
sound
of
steel,
some
of
the
other
red
cloaks
rushed
to
join
him,
barehand
or
no.
I
hanged
those
beside
the
four
who
freed
him,
and
threw
the
rest
in
the
dungeons.
Jaime
too.
We’ll
have
no
more
escapes
from
that
one.
He’s
down
in
the
dark
this
time,
chained
hand
and
foot
and
bolted
to
the
wall.”

“And
Cleos
Frey?”

“He
swears
he
knew
naught
of
the
plot.
Who
can
say?
The
man
is
half
Lannister,
half
Frey,
and
all
liar.
I
put
him
in
Jaime’s
old
tower
cell.”

“You
say
he
brought
terms?”

“If
you
can
call
them
that.
You’ll
like
them
no
more
than
I
did,
I
promise.”

“Can
we
hope
for
no
help
from
the
south,
Lady
Stark?”
asked
Utherydes
Wayn,
her
father’s
steward.
“This
charge
of
incest…
Lord
Tywin
does
not
suffer
such
slights
lightly.
He
will
seek
to
wash
the
stain
from
his
daughter’s
name
with
the
blood
of
her
accuser,
Lord
Stannis
must
see
that.
He
has
no
choice
but
to
make
common
cause
with
us.”

Stannis
has
made
common
cause
with
a
power
greater
and
darker.
“Let
us
speak
of
these
matters
later.”
Catelyn
trotted
over
the
drawbridge,
putting
the
grisly
row
of
dead
Lannisters
behind
her.
Her
brother
kept
pace.
As
they
rode
out
into
the
bustle
of
Riverrun’s
upper
bailey,
a
naked
toddler
ran
=======
cloak.
Jory
brought
out
his
horse.
Young
Wyl
came
right
behind
him,
leading
Littlefinger’s
mare
with
one
hand
while
the
other
fumbled
with
his
belt
and
the
lacings
of
his
trousers.
A
barefoot
whore
leaned
out
of
the
stable
door,
giggling
at
him.

“Will
we
be
going
back
to
the
castle
now,
my
lord?”
Jory
asked.
Ned
nodded
and
swung
into
the
saddle.
Littlefinger
mounted
up
beside
him.
Jory
and
the
others
followed.

“Chataya
runs
a
choice
establishment,”
Littlefinger
said
as
they
rode.
“I’ve
half
a
mind
to
buy
it.
Brothels
are
a
much
sounder
investment
than
ships,
I’ve
found.
Whores
seldom
sink,
and
when
they
are
boarded
by
pirates,
why,
the
pirates
pay
good
coin
like
everyone
else.”
Lord
Petyr
chuckled
at
his
own
wit.

Ned
let
him
prattle
on.
After
a
time,
he
quieted
and
they
rode
in
silence.
The
streets
of
King’s
Landing
were
dark
and
deserted.
The
rain
had
driven
everyone
under
their
roofs.
It
beat
down
on
Ned’s
head,
warm
as
blood
and
relentless
as
old
guilts.
Fat
drops
of
water
ran
down
his
face.

“Robert
will
never
keep
to
one
bed,”
Lyanna
had
told
him
at
Winterfell,
on
the
night
long
ago
when
their
father
had
promised
her
hand
to
the
young
Lord
of
Storm’s
End.
“I
hear
he
has
gotten
a
child
on
some
girl
in
the
Vale.”
Ned
had
held
the
babe
in
his
arms;
he
could
scarcely
deny
her,
nor
would
he
lie
to
his
sister,
but
he
had
assured
her
that
what
Robert
did
before
their
betrothal
was
of
no
matter,
that
he
was
a
good
man
and
true
who
would
love
her
with
all
his
heart.
Lyanna
had
only
smiled.
“Love
is
sweet,
dearest
Ned,
but
it
cannot
change
a
man’s
nature.”

The
girl
had
been
so
young
Ned
had
not
dared
to
ask
her
age.
No
doubt
she’d
been
a
virgin;
the
better
brothels
could
always
find
a
virgin,
if
the
purse
was
fat
enough.
She
had
light
red
hair
and
a
powdering
of
freckles
across
the
bridge
of
her
nose,
and
when
she
slipped
free
a
breast
to
give
her
nipple
to
the
babe,
he
saw
that
her
bosom
was
freckled
as
well.
“I
named
her
Barra,”
she
said
as
the
child
nursed.
“She
looks
so
like
him,
does
she
not,
milord?
She
has
his
nose,
and
his
hair…”

“She
does.”
Eddard
Stark
had
touched
the
baby’s
fine,
dark
hair.
It
flowed
through
his
fingers
like
black
silk.
Robert’s
firstborn
had
had
the
same
fine
hair,
he
seemed
to
recall.

“Tell
him
that
when
you
see
him,
milord,
as
it…
as
it
please
you.
Tell
him
how
beautiful
she
is.”

“I
will,”
Ned
had
promised
her.
That
was
his
curse.
Robert
would
swear
undying
love
and
forget
them
before
evenfall,
but
Ned
Stark
kept
his
vows.
He
thought
of
the
promises
he’d
made
Lyanna
as
she
lay
dying,
and
the
price
he’d
paid
to
keep
them.

“And
tell
him
I’ve
not
been
with
no
one
else.
I
swear
it,
milord,
by
the
old
gods
and
new.
Chataya
said
I
could
have
half
a
year,
for
the
baby,
and
for
hoping
he’d
come
back.
So
you’ll
tell
him
I’m
waiting,
won’t
you?
I
don’t
want
no
jewels
or
nothing,
just
him.
He
was
always
good
to
me,
truly.”

Good
to
you,
Ned
thought
hollowly.
“I
will
tell
him,
child,
and
I
promise
you,
Barra
shall
not
go
wanting.”

She
had
smiled
then,
a
smile
so
tremulous
and
sweet
that
it
cut
the
heart
out
of
him.
Riding
through
the
rainy
night,
Ned
saw
Jon
Snow’s
face
in
front
of
him,
so
like
a
younger
version
of
his
own.
If
the
gods
frowned
so
on
bastards,
he
thought
dully,
why
did
they
fill
men
with
such
lusts?
“Lord
Baelish,
what
do
you
know
of
Robert’s
bastards?”

“Well,
he
has
more
than
you,
for
a
start.”

“How
many?”

Littlefinger
shrugged.
Rivulets
of
moisture
twisted
down
the
back
of
his
cloak.
“Does
it
matter?
If
you
bed
enough
women,
some
will
give
you
presents,
and
His
Grace
has
never
been
shy
on
that
count.
I
know
he’s
acknowledged
that
boy
at
Storm’s
End,
the
one
he
fathered
the
night
Lord
Stannis
wed.
He
could
hardly
do
otherwise.
The
mother
was
a
Florent,
niece
to
the
Lady
Selyse,
one
of
her
bedmaids.
Renly
says
that
Robert
carried
the
girl
upstairs
during
the
feast,
and
broke
in
the
wedding
bed
while
Stannis
and
his
bride
were
still
dancing.
Lord
Stannis
seemed
to
think
that
was
a
blot
on
the
honor
of
his
wife’s
House,
so
when
the
boy
was
born,
he
shipped
him
off
to
Renly.”
He
gave
Ned
a
sideways
glance.
“I’ve
also
heard
whispers
that
Robert
got
a
pair
of
twins
on
a
serving
wench
at
Casterly
Rock,
three
years
ago
when
he
went
west
for
Lord
Tywin’s
tourney.
Cersei
had
the
babes
killed,
and
sold
the
mother
to
a
passing
slaver.
Too
much
an
affront
to
Lannister
pride,
that
close
to
home.”

Ned
Stark
grimaced.
Ugly
tales
like
that
were
told
of
every
great
lord
in
the
realm.
He
could
believe
it
of
Cersei
Lannister
readily
enough…
but
would
the
king
stand
by
and
let
it
happen?
The
Robert
he
had
known
would
not
have,
but
the
Robert
he
had
known
had
never
been
so
practiced
at
shutting
his
eyes
to
things
he
did
not
wish
to
see.
“Why
would
Jon
Arryn
take
a
sudden
interest
in
the
king’s
baseborn
children?”

The
short
man
gave
a
sodden
shrug.
“He
was
the
King’s
Hand.
Doubtless
Robert
asked
him
to
see
that
they
were
provided
for.”

Ned
was
soaked
through
to
the
bone,
and
his
soul
had
grown
cold.
“It
had
to
be
more
than
that,
or
why
kill
him?”

Littlefinger
shook
the
rain
from
his
hair
and
laughed.
“Now
I
see.
Lord
Arryn
learned
that
His
Grace
had
filled
the
bellies
of
some
whores
and
fishwives,
and
for
that
he
had
to
be
silenced.
Small
wonder.
Allow
a
man
like
that
to
live,
and
next
he’s
like
to
blurt
out
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
east.”

There
was
no
answer
Ned
Stark
could
give
to
that
but
a
frown.
For
the
first
time
in
years,
he
found
himself
remembering
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
He
wondered
if
Rhaegar
had
frequented
brothels;
somehow
he
thought
not.

The
rain
was
falling
harder
now,
stinging
the
eyes
and
drumming
against
the
ground.
Rivers
of
black
water
were
running
down
the
hill
when
Jory
called
out,
“My
lord,”
his
voice
hoarse
with
alarm.
And
in
an
instant,
the
street
was
full
of
soldiers.

Ned
glimpsed
ringmail
over
leather,
gauntlets
and
greaves,
steel
helms
with
golden
lions
on
the
crests.
Their
cloaks
clung
to
their
backs,
sodden
with
rain.
He
had
no
time
to
count,
but
there
were
ten
at
least,
a
line
of
them,
on
foot,
blocking
the
street,
with
longswords
and
iron-tipped
spears.
“Behind!”
he
heard
Wyl
cry,
and
when
he
turned
his
horse,
there
were
more
in
back
of
them,
cutting
off
their
retreat.
Jory’s
sword
came
singing
from
its
scabbard.
“Make
way
or
die!”

“The
wolves
are
howling,”
their
leader
said.
Ned
could
see
rain
running
down
his
face.
“Such
a
small
pack,
though.”

Littlefinger
walked
his
horse
forward,
step
by
careful
step.
“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?
This
is
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

“He
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.”
The
mud
muffled
the
hooves
of
the
blood
bay
stallion.
The
line
parted
before
him.
On
a
golden
breastplate,
the
lion
of
Lannister
roared
its
defiance.
“Now,
if
truth
be
told,
I’m
not
sure
what
he
is.”

“Lannister,
this
is
madness,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Let
us
pass.
We
are
expected
back
at
the
castle.
What
do
you
think
you’re
doing?”

“He
knows
what
he’s
doing,”
Ned
said
calmly.

Jaime
Lannister
smiled.
“Quite
true.
I’m
looking
for
my
brother.
You
remember
my
brother,
don’t
you,
Lord
Stark?
He
was
with
us
at
Winterfell.
Fair-haired,
mismatched
eyes,
sharp
of
tongue.
A
short
man.”

“I
remember
him
well,”
Ned
replied.

“It
would
seem
he
has
met
some
trouble
on
the
road.
My
lord
father
is
quite
vexed.
You
would
not
perchance
have
any
notion
of
who
might
have
wished
my
brother
ill,
would
you?”

“Your
brother
has
been
taken
at
my
command,
to
answer
for
his
crimes,”
Ned
Stark
said.

Littlefinger
groaned
in
dismay.
“My
lords—”

Ser
Jaime
ripped
his
longsword
from
its
sheath
and
urged
his
stallion
forward.
“Show
me
your
steel,
Lord
Eddard.
I’ll
butcher
you
like
Aerys
if
I
must,
but
I’d
sooner
you
died
with
a
blade
in
your
hand.”
He
gave
Littlefinger
a
cool,
contemptuous
glance.
“Lord
Baelish,
I’d
leave
here
in
some
haste
if
I
did
not
care
to
get
bloodstains
on
my
costly
clothing.”

Littlefinger
did
not
need
to
be
urged.
“I
will
bring
the
City
Watch,”
he
promised
Ned.
The
Lannister
line
parted
to
let
him
through,
and
closed
behind
him.
Littlefinger
put
his
heels
to
his
mare
and
vanished
around
a
corner.

Ned’s
men
had
drawn
their
swords,
but
they
were
three
against
twenty.
Eyes
watched
from
nearby
windows
and
doors,
but
no
one
was
about
to
intervene.
His
party
was
mounted,
the
Lannisters
on
foot
save
for
Jaime
himself.
A
charge
might
win
them
free,
but
it
seemed
to
Eddard
Stark
that
they
had
a
surer,
safer
tactic.
“Kill
me,”
he
warned
the
Kingslayer,
“and
Catelyn
will
most
certainly
slay
Tyrion.”

Jaime
Lannister
poked
at
Ned’s
chest
with
the
gilded
sword
that
had
sipped
the
blood
of
the
last
of
the
Dragonkings.
“Would
she?
The
noble
Catelyn
Tully
of
Riverrun
murder
a
hostage?
I
think…
not.”
He
sighed.
“But
I
am
not
willing
to
chance
my
brother’s
life
on
a
woman’s
honor.”
Jaime
slid
the
golden
sword
into
its
sheath.
“So
I
suppose
I’ll
let
you
run
back
to
Robert
to
tell
him
how
I
frightened
you.
I
wonder
if
he’ll
care.”
Jaime
pushed
his
wet
hair
back
with
his
fingers
and
wheeled
his
horse
around.
When
he
was
beyond
the
line
of
swordsmen,
he
glanced
back
at
his
captain.
“Tregar,
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
Lord
Stark.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord.”

“Still…
we
wouldn’t
want
him
to
leave
here
entirely
unchastened,
so”—through
the
night
and
the
rain,
he
glimpsed
the
white
of
Jaime’s
smile—“kill
his
men.”

“No!”
Ned
Stark
screamed,
clawing
for
his
sword.
Jaime
was
already
cantering
off
down
the
street
as
he
heard
Wyl
shout.
Men
closed
from
both
sides.
Ned
rode
one
down,
cutting
at
phantoms
in
red
cloaks
who
gave
way
before
him.
Jory
Cassel
put
his
heels
into
his
mount
and
charged.
A
steel-shod
hoof
caught
a
Lannister
guardsman
in
the
face
with
a
sickening
crunch.
A
second
man
reeled
away
and
for
an
instant
Jory
was
free.
Wyl
cursed
as
they
pulled
him
off
his
dying
horse,
swords
slashing
in
the
rain.
Ned
galloped
to
him,
bringing
his
longsword
down
on
Tregar’s
helm.
The
jolt
of
impact
made
him
grit
his
teeth.
Tregar
stumbled
to
his
knees,
his
lion
crest
sheared
in
half,
blood
running
down
his
face.
Heward
was
hacking
at
the
hands
that
had
seized
his
bridle
when
a
spear
caught
him
in
the
belly.
Suddenly
Jory
was
back
among
them,
a
red
rain
flying
from
his
sword.
“No!”
Ned
shouted.
“Jory,
away!”
Ned’s
horse
slipped
under
him
and
came
crashing
down
in
the
mud.
There
was
a
moment
of
blinding
pain
and
the
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth.

He
saw
them
cut
the
legs
from
Jory’s
mount
and
drag
him
to
the
earth,
swords
rising
and
failing
as
they
closed
in
around
him.
When
Ned’s
horse
lurched
back
to
its
feet,
he
tried
to
rise,
only
to
fall
again,
choking
on
his
scream.
He
could
see
the
splintered
bone
poking
through
his
calf.
It
was
the
last
thing
he
saw
for
a
time.
The
rain
came
down
and
down
and
down.

When
he
opened
his
eyes
again,
Lord
Eddard
Stark
was
alone
with
his
dead.
His
horse
moved
closer,
caught
the
rank
scent
of
blood,
and
galloped
away.
Ned
began
to
drag
himself
through
the
mud,
gritting
his
teeth
at
the
agony
in
his
leg.
It
seemed
to
take
years.
Faces
watched
from
candlelit
windows,
and
people
began
to
emerge
from
alleys
and
doors,
but
no
one
moved
to
help.

Littlefinger
and
the
City
Watch
found
him
there
in
the
street,
cradling
Jory
Cassel’s
body
in
his
arms.

Somewhere
the
gold
cloaks
found
a
litter,
but
the
trip
back
to
the
castle
was
a
blur
of
agony,
and
Ned
lost
consciousness
more
than
once.
He
remembered
seeing
the
Red
Keep
looming
ahead
of
him
in
the
first
grey
light
of
dawn.
The
rain
had
darkened
the
pale
pink
stone
of
the
massive
walls
to
the
color
of
blood.

Then
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
looming
over
him,
holding
a
cup,
whispering,
“Drink,
my
lord.
Here.
The
milk
of
the
poppy,
for
your
pain.”
He
remembered
swallowing,
and
Pycelle
was
telling
someone
to
heat
the
wine
to
boiling
and
fetch
him
clean
silk,
and
that
was
the
last
he
knew.





DAENERYS

The
Horse
Gate
of
Vaes
Dothrak
was
made
of
two
gigantic
bronze
stallions,
rearing,
their
hooves
meeting
a
hundred
feet
above
the
roadway
to
form
a
pointed
arch.

Dany
could
not
have
said
why
the
city
needed
a
gate
when
it
had
no
walls…
and
no
buildings
that
she
could
see.
Yet
there
it
stood,
immense
and
beautiful,
the
great
horses
framing
the
distant
purple
mountain
beyond.
The
bronze
stallions
threw
long
shadows
across
the
waving
grasses
as
Khal
Drogo
led
the
khalasar
under
their
hooves
and
down
the
godsway,
his
bloodriders
beside
him.

Dany
followed
on
her
silver,
escorted
by
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
and
her
brother
Viserys,
mounted
once
more.
After
the
day
in
the
grass
when
she
had
left
him
to
walk
back
to
the
khalasar,
the
Dothraki
had
laughingly
called
him
Khal
Rhae
Mhar,
the
Sorefoot
King.
Khal
Drogo
had
offered
him
a
place
in
a
cart
the
next
day,
and
Viserys
had
accepted.
In
his
stubborn
ignorance,
he
had
not
even
known
he
was
being
mocked;
the
carts
were
for
eunuchs,
cripples,
women
giving
birth,
the
very
young
and
the
very
old.
That
won
him
yet
another
name:
Khal
Rhaggat,
the
Cart
King.
Her
brother
had
thought
it
was
the
khal’s
way
of
apologizing
for
the
wrong
Dany
had
done
him.
She
had
begged
Ser
Jorah
not
to
tell
him
the
truth,
lest
he
be
shamed.
The
knight
had
replied
that
the
king
could
well
do
with
a
bit
of
shame…
yet
he
had
done
as
she
bid.
It
had
taken
much
pleading,
and
all
the
pillow
tricks
Doreah
had
taught
her,
before
Dany
had
been
able
to
make
Drogo
relent
and
allow
Viserys
to
rejoin
them
at
the
head
of
the
column.

“Where
is
the
city?”
she
asked
as
they
passed
beneath
the
bronze
arch.
There
were
no
buildings
to
be
seen,
no
people,
only
the
grass
and
the
road,
lined
with
ancient
monuments
from
all
the
lands
the
Dothraki
had
sacked
over
the
centuries.

“Ahead,”
Ser
Jorah
answered.
“Under
the
mountain.”

Beyond
the
horse
gate,
plundered
gods
and
stolen
heroes
loomed
to
either
side
of
them.
The
forgotten
deities
of
dead
cities
brandished
their
broken
thunderbolts
at
the
sky
as
Dany
rode
her
silver
past
their
feet.
Stone
kings
looked
down
on
her
from
their
thrones,
their
faces
chipped
and
stained,
even
their
names
lost
in
the
mists
of
time.
Lithe
young
maidens
danced
on
marble
plinths,
draped
only
in
flowers,
or
poured
air
from
shattered
jars.
Monsters
stood
in
the
grass
beside
the
road;
black
iron
dragons
with
jewels
for
eyes,
roaring
griffins,
manticores
with
their
barbed
tails
poised
to
strike,
and
other
beasts
she
could
not
name.
Some
of
the
statues
were
so
lovely
they
took
her
breath
away,
others
so
misshapen
and
terrible
that
Dany
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
them.
Those,
Ser
Jorah
said,
had
likely
come
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai.

“So
many,”
she
said
as
her
silver
stepped
slowly
onward,
“and
from
so
many
lands.”

Viserys
was
less
impressed.
“The
trash
of
dead
cities,”
he
sneered.
He
was
careful
to
speak
in
the
Common
Tongue,
which
few
Dothraki
could
understand,
yet
even
so
Dany
found
herself
glancing
back
at
the
men
of
her
khas,
to
make
certain
he
had
not
been
overheard.
He
went
on
blithely.
“All
these
savages
know
how
to
do
is
steal
the
things
better
men
have
built…
and
kill.”
He
laughed.
“They
do
know
how
to
kill.
Otherwise
I’d
have
no
use
for
them
at
all.”

“They
are
my
people
now,”
Dany
said.
“You
should
not
call
them
savages,
brother.”

“The
dragon
speaks
as
he
likes,”
Viserys
said…
in
the
Common
Tongue.
He
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
Aggo
and
Rakharo,
riding
behind
them,
and
favored
them
with
a
mocking
smile.
“See,
the
savages
lack
the
wit
to
understand
the
speech
of
civilized
men.”
A
moss-eaten
stone
monolith
loomed
over
the
road,
fifty
feet
tall.
Viserys
gazed
at
it
with
boredom
in
his
eyes.
“How
long
must
we
linger
amidst
these
ruins
before
Drogo
gives
me
my
army?
I
grow
tired
of
waiting.”

“The
princess
must
be
presented
to
the
dosh
khaleen…”

“The
crones,
yes,”
her
brother
interrupted,
“and
there’s
to
be
some
mummer’s
show
of
a
prophecy
for
the
whelp
in
her
belly,
you
told
me.
What
is
that
to
me?
I’m
tired
of
eating
horsemeat
and
I’m
sick
of
the
stink
of
these
savages.”
He
sniffed
at
the
wide,
floppy
sleeve
of
his
tunic,
where
it
was
his
custom
to
keep
a
sachet.
It
could
not
have
helped
much.
The
tunic
was
filthy.
All
the
silk
and
heavy
wools
that
Viserys
had
worn
out
of
Pentos
were
stained
by
hard
travel
and
rotted
from
sweat.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said,
“The
Western
Market
will
have
food
more
to
your
taste,
Your
Grace.
The
traders
from
the
Free
Cities
come
there
to
sell
their
wares.
The
khal
will
honor
his
promise
in
his
own
time.”

“He
had
better,”
Viserys
said
grimly.
“I
was
promised
a
crown,
and
I
mean
to
have
it.
The
dragon
is
not
mocked.”
Spying
an
obscene
likeness
of
a
woman
with
six
breasts
and
a
ferret’s
head,
he
rode
off
to
inspect
it
more
closely.

Dany
was
relieved,
yet
no
less
anxious.
“I
pray
that
my
sun-and-stars
will
not
keep
him
waiting
too
long,”
she
told
Ser
Jorah
when
her
brother
was
out
of
earshot.

The
knight
looked
after
Viserys
doubtfully.
“Your
brother
should
have
bided
his
time
in
Pentos.
There
is
no
place
for
him
in
a
khalasar.
Illyrio
tried
to
warn
him.”

“He
will
go
as
soon
as
he
has
his
ten
thousand.
My
lord
husband
promised
a
golden
crown.”

Ser
Jorah
grunted.
“Yes,
Khaleesi,
but…
the
Dothraki
look
on
these
things
differently
than
we
do
in
the
west.
I
have
told
him
as
much,
as
Illyrio
told
him,
but
your
brother
does
not
listen.
The
horselords
are
no
traders.
Viserys
thinks
he
sold
you,
and
now
he
wants
his
price.
Yet
Khal
Drogo
would
say
he
had
you
as
a
gift.
He
will
give
Viserys
a
gift
in
return,
yes…
in
his
own
time.
You
do
not
demand
a
gift,
not
of
a
khal.
You
do
not
demand
anything
of
a
khal.”

“It
is
not
right
to
make
him
wait.”
Dany
did
not
know
why
she
was
defending
her
brother,
yet
she
was.
“Viserys
says
he
could
sweep
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
ten
thousand
Dothraki
screamers.”

Ser
Jorah
snorted.
“Viserys
could
not
sweep
a
stable
with
ten
thousand
brooms.”

Dany
could
not
pretend
to
surprise
at
the
disdain
in
his
tone.
“What…
what
if
it
were
not
Viserys?”
she
asked.
“If
it
were
someone
else
who
led
them?
Someone
stronger?
Could
the
Dothraki
truly
conquer
the
Seven
Kingdoms?”

Ser
Jorah’s
face
grew
thoughtful
as
their
horses
trod
together
down
the
godsway.
“When
I
first
went
into
exile,
I
looked
at
the
Dothraki
and
saw
half-naked
barbarians,
as
wild
as
their
horses.
If
you
had
asked
me
then,
Princess,
I
should
have
told
you
that
a
thousand
good
knights
would
have
no
trouble
putting
to
flight
a
hundred
times
as
many
Dothraki.”

“But
if
I
asked
you
now?”

“Now,”
the
knight
said,
“I
am
less
certain.
They
are
better
riders
than
any
knight,
utterly
fearless,
and
their
bows
outrange
ours.
In
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
most
archers
fight
on
foot,
from
behind
a
shieldwall
or
a
barricade
of
sharpened
stakes.
The
Dothraki
fire
from
horseback,
charging
or
retreating,
it
makes
no
matter,
they
are
full
as
deadly…
and
there
are
so
many
of
them,
my
lady.
Your
lord
husband
alone
counts
forty
thousand
mounted
warriors
in
his
khalasar.”

“Is
that
truly
so
many?”

“Your
brother
Rhaegar
brought
as
many
men
to
the
Trident,”
Ser
Jorah
admitted,
“but
of
that
number,
no
more
than
a
tenth
were
knights.
The
rest
were
archers,
freeriders,
and
foot
soldiers
armed
with
spears
and
pikes.
When
Rhaegar
fell,
many
threw
down
their
weapons
and
fled
the
field.
How
long
do
you
imagine
such
a
rabble
would
stand
against
the
charge
of
forty
thousand
screamers
howling
for
blood?
How
well
would
boiled
leather
jerkins
and
mailed
shirts
protect
them
when
the
arrows
fall
like
rain?”

“Not
long,”
she
said,
“not
well.”

He
nodded.
“Mind
you,
Princess,
if
the
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
have
the
wit
the
gods
gave
a
goose,
it
will
never
come
to
that.
The
riders
have
no
taste
for
siegecraft.
I
doubt
they
could
take
even
the
weakest
castle
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
if
Robert
Baratheon
were
fool
enough
to
give
them
battle…”

“Is
he?”
Dany
asked.
“A
fool,
I
mean?”

Ser
Jorah
considered
that
for
a
moment.
“Robert
should
have
been
born
Dothraki,”
he
said
at
last.
“Your
khal
would
tell
you
that
only
a
coward
hides
behind
stone
walls
instead
of
facing
his
enemy
with
a
blade
in
hand.
The
Usurper
would
agree.
He
is
a
strong
man,
brave…
and
rash
enough
to
meet
a
Dothraki
horde
in
the
open
field.
But
the
men
around
him,
well,
their
pipers
play
a
different
tune.
His
brother
Stannis,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
Eddard
Stark…”
He
spat.

“You
hate
this
Lord
Stark,”
Dany
said.

“He
took
from
me
all
I
loved,
for
the
sake
of
a
few
lice-ridden
poachers
and
his
precious
honor,”
Ser
Jorah
said
bitterly.
From
his
tone,
she
could
tell
the
loss
still
pained
him.
He
changed
the
subject
quickly.
“There,”
he
announced,
pointing.
“Vaes
Dothrak.
The
city
of
the
horselords.”

Khal
Drogo
and
his
bloodriders
led
them
through
the
great
bazaar
of
the
Western
Market,
down
the
broad
ways
beyond.
Dany
followed
close
on
her
silver,
staring
at
the
strangeness
about
her.
Vaes
Dothrak
was
at
once
the
largest
city
and
the
smallest
that
she
had
ever
known.
She
thought
it
must
be
ten
times
as
large
as
Pentos,
a
vastness
without
walls
or
limits,
its
broad
windswept
streets
paved
in
grass
and
mud
and
carpeted
with
wildflowers.
In
the
Free
Cities
of
the
west,
towers
and
manses
and
hovels
and
bridges
and
shops
and
halls
all
crowded
in
on
one
another,
but
Vaes
Dothrak
sprawled
languorously,
baking
in
the
warm
sun,
ancient,
arrogant,
and
empty.

Even
the
buildings
were
so
queer
to
her
eyes.
She
saw
carved
stone
pavilions,
manses
of
woven
grass
as
large
as
castles,
rickety
wooden
towers,
stepped
pyramids
faced
with
marble,
log
halls
open
to
the
sky.
In
place
of
walls,
some
palaces
were
surrounded
by
thorny
hedges.
“None
of
them
are
alike,”
she
said.

“Your
brother
had
part
of
the
truth,”
Ser
Jorah
admitted.
“The
Dothraki
do
not
build.
A
thousand
years
ago,
to
make
a
house,
they
would
dig
a
hole
in
the
earth
and
cover
it
with
a
woven
grass
roof.
The
buildings
you
see
were
made
by
slaves
brought
here
from
lands
they’ve
plundered,
and
they
built
each
after
the
fashion
of
their
own
peoples.”

Most
of
the
halls,
even
the
largest,
seemed
deserted.
“Where
are
the
people
who
live
here?”
Dany
asked.
The
bazaar
had
been
full
of
running
children
and
men
shouting,
but
elsewhere
she
had
seen
only
a
few
eunuchs
going
about
their
business.

“Only
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
dwell
permanently
in
the
sacred
city,
them
and
their
slaves
and
servants,”
Ser
Jorah
replied,
“yet
Vaes
Dothrak
is
large
enough
to
house
every
man
of
every
khalasar,
should
all
the
khals
return
to
the
Mother
at
once.
The
crones
have
prophesied
that
one
day
that
will
come
to
pass,
and
so
Vaes
Dothrak
must
be
ready
to
embrace
all
its
children.”

Khal
Drogo
finally
called
a
halt
near
the
Eastern
Market
where
the
caravans
from
Yi
Ti
and
Asshai
and
the
Shadow
Lands
came
to
trade,
with
the
Mother
of
Mountains
looming
overhead.
Dany
smiled
as
she
recalled
Magister
Illyrio’s
slave
girl
and
her
talk
of
a
palace
with
two
hundred
rooms
and
doors
of
solid
silver.
The
“palace”
was
a
cavernous
wooden
feasting
hall,
its
rough-hewn
timbered
walls
rising
forty
feet,
its
roof
sewn
silk,
a
vast
billowing
tent
that
could
be
raised
to
keep
out
the
rare
rains,
or
lowered
to
admit
the
endless
sky.
Around
the
hall
were
broad
grassy
horse
yards
fenced
with
high
hedges,
firepits,
and
hundreds
of
round
earthen
houses
that
bulged
from
the
ground
like
miniature
hills,
covered
with
grass.

A
small
army
of
slaves
had
gone
ahead
to
prepare
for
Khal
Drogo’s
arrival.
As
each
rider
swung
down
from
his
saddle,
he
unbelted
his
arakh
and
handed
it
to
a
waiting
slave,
and
any
other
weapons
he
carried
as
well.
Even
Khal
Drogo
himself
was
not
exempt.
Ser
Jorah
had
explained
that
it
was
forbidden
to
carry
a
blade
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
or
to
shed
a
free
man’s
blood.
Even
warring
khalasars
put
aside
their
feuds
and
shared
meat
and
mead
together
when
they
were
in
sight
of
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
In
this
place,
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
had
decreed,
all
Dothraki
were
one
blood,
one
khalasar,
one
herd.

Cohollo
came
to
Dany
as
Irri
and
Jhiqui
were
helping
her
down
off
her
silver.
He
was
the
oldest
of
Drogo’s
three
bloodriders,
a
squat
bald
man
with
a
crooked
nose
and
a
mouth
full
of
broken
teeth,
shattered
by
a
mace
twenty
years
before
when
he
saved
the
young
khalakka
from
sellswords
who
hoped
to
sell
him
to
his
father’s
enemies.
His
life
had
been
bound
to
Drogo’s
the
day
her
lord
husband
was
born.

Every
khal
had
his
bloodriders.
At
first
Dany
had
thought
of
them
as
a
kind
of
Dothraki
Kingsguard,
sworn
to
protect
their
lord,
but
it
went
further
than
that.
Jhiqui
had
taught
her
that
a
bloodrider
was
more
than
a
guard;
they
were
the
khal’s
brothers,
his
shadows,
his
fiercest
friends.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Drogo
called
them,
and
so
it
was;
they
shared
a
single
life.
The
ancient
traditions
of
the
horselords
demanded
that
when
the
khal
died,
his
bloodriders
died
with
him,
to
ride
at
his
side
in
the
night
lands.
If
the
khal
died
at
the
hands
of
some
enemy,
they
lived
only
long
enough
to
avenge
him,
and
then
followed
him
joyfully
into
the
grave.
In
some
khalasars,
Jhiqui
said,
the
bloodriders
shared
the
khal’s
wine,
his
tent,
and
even
his
wives,
though
never
his
horses.
A
man’s
mount
was
his
own.

Daenerys
was
glad
that
Khal
Drogo
did
not
hold
to
those
ancient
ways.
She
should
not
have
liked
being
shared.
And
while
old
Cohollo
treated
her
kindly
enough,
the
others
frightened
her;
Haggo,
huge
and
silent,
often
glowered
as
if
he
had
forgotten
who
she
was,
and
Qotho
had
cruel
eyes
and
quick
hands
that
liked
to
hurt.
He
left
bruises
on
Doreah’s
soft
white
skin
whenever
he
touched
her,
and
sometimes
made
Irri
sob
in
the
night.
Even
his
horses
seemed
to
fear
him.

Yet
they
were
bound
to
Drogo
for
life
and
death,
so
Daenerys
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
them.
And
sometimes
she
found
herself
wishing
her
father
had
been
protected
by
such
men.
In
the
songs,
the
white
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
were
ever
noble,
valiant,
and
true,
and
yet
King
Aerys
had
been
murdered
by
one
of
them,
the
handsome
boy
they
now
called
the
Kingslayer,
and
a
second,
Ser
Barristan
the
Bold,
had
gone
over
to
the
Usurper.
She
wondered
if
all
men
were
as
false
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
When
her
son
sat
the
Iron
Throne,
she
would
see
that
he
had
bloodriders
of
his
own
to
protect
him
against
treachery
in
his
Kingsguard.

“Khaleesi,”
Cohollo
said
to
her,
in
Dothraki.
“Drogo,
who
is
blood
of
my
blood,
commands
me
to
tell
you
that
he
must
ascend
the
Mother
of
Mountains
this
night,
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
for
his
safe
return.”

Only
men
were
allowed
to
set
foot
on
the
Mother,
Dany
knew.
The
khal’s
bloodriders
would
go
with
him,
and
return
at
dawn.
“Tell
my
sun-and-stars
that
I
dream
of
him,
and
wait
anxious
for
his
return,”
she
replied,
thankful.
Dany
tired
more
easily
as
the
child
grew
within
her;
in
truth,
a
night
of
rest
would
be
most
welcome.
Her
pregnancy
only
seemed
to
have
inflamed
Drogo’s
desire
for
her,
and
of
late
his
embraces
left
her
exhausted.

Doreah
led
her
to
the
hollow
hill
that
had
been
prepared
for
her
and
her
khal.
It
was
cool
and
dim
within,
like
a
tent
made
of
earth.
“Jhiqui,
a
bath,
please,”
she
commanded,
to
wash
the
dust
of
travel
from
her
skin
and
soak
her
weary
bones.
It
was
pleasant
to
know
that
they
would
linger
here
for
a
while,
that
she
would
not
need
to
climb
back
on
her
silver
on
the
morrow.

The
water
was
scalding
hot,
as
she
liked
it.
“I
will
give
my
brother
his
gifts
tonight,”
she
decided
as
Jhiqui
was
washing
her
hair.
“He
should
look
a
king
in
the
sacred
city.
Doreah,
run
and
find
him
and
invite
him
to
sup
with
me.”
Viserys
was
nicer
to
the
Lysene
girl
than
to
her
Dothraki
handmaids,
perhaps
because
Magister
Illyrio
had
let
him
bed
her
back
in
Pentos.
“Irri,
go
to
the
bazaar
and
buy
fruit
and
meat.
Anything
but
horseflesh.”

“Horse
is
best,”
Irri
said.
“Horse
makes
a
man
strong.”

“Viserys
hates
horsemeat.”

“As
you
say,
Khaleesi.”

She
brought
back
a
haunch
of
goat
and
a
basket
of
fruits
and
vegetables.
Jhiqui
roasted
the
meat
with
sweetgrass
and
firepods,
basting
it
with
honey
as
it
cooked,
and
there
were
melons
and
pomegranates
and
plums
and
some
queer
eastern
fruit
Dany
did
not
know.
While
her
handmaids
prepared
the
meal,
Dany
laid
out
the
clothing
she’d
had
made
to
her
brother’s
measure:
a
tunic
and
leggings
of
crisp
white
linen,
leather
sandals
that
laced
up
to
the
knee,
a
bronze
medallion
belt,
a
leather
vest
painted
with
fire-breathing
dragons.
The
Dothraki
would
respect
him
more
if
he
looked
less
a
beggar,
she
hoped,
and
perhaps
he
would
forgive
her
for
shaming
him
that
day
in
the
grass.
He
was
still
her
king,
after
all,
and
her
brother.
They
were
both
blood
of
the
dragon.

She
was
arranging
the
last
of
his
gifts—a
sandsilk
cloak,
green
as
grass,
with
a
pale
grey
border
that
would
bring
out
the
silver
in
his
hair—when
Viserys
arrived,
dragging
Doreah
by
the
arm.
Her
eye
was
red
where
he’d
hit
her.
“How
dare
you
send
this
whore
to
give
me
commands,”
he
said.
He
shoved
the
handmaid
roughly
to
the
carpet.

The
anger
took
Dany
utterly
by
surprise.
“I
only
wanted…
Doreah,
what
did
you
say?”

“Khaleesi,
pardons,
forgive
me.
I
went
to
him,
as
you
bid,
and
told
him
you
commanded
him
to
join
you
for
supper.”

“No
one
commands
the
dragon,”
Viserys
snarled.
“I
am
your
king!
I
should
have
sent
you
back
her
head!”

The
Lysene
girl
quailed,
but
Dany
calmed
her
with
a
touch.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
he
won’t
hurt
you.
Sweet
brother,
please,
forgive
her,
the
girl
misspoke
herself,
I
told
her
to
ask
you
to
sup
with
me,
if
it
pleases
Your
Grace.”
She
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
across
the
room.
“Look.
These
are
for
you.”

Viserys
frowned
suspiciously.
“What
is
all
this?”

“New
raiment.
I
had
it
made
for
you.”
Dany
smiled
shyly.

He
looked
at
her
and
sneered.
“Dothraki
rags.
Do
you
presume
to
dress
me
now?”

“Please…
you’ll
be
cooler
and
more
comfortable,
and
I
thought…
maybe
if
you
dressed
like
them,
the
Dothraki…”
Dany
did
not
know
how
to
say
it
without
waking
his
dragon.

“Next
you’ll
want
to
braid
my
hair.”

“I’d
never…”
Why
was
he
always
so
cruel?
She
had
only
wanted
to
help.
“You
have
no
right
to
a
braid,
you
have
won
no
victories
yet.”

It
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say.
Fury
shone
from
his
lilac
eyes,
yet
he
dared
not
strike
her,
not
with
her
handmaids
watching
and
the
warriors
of
her
khas
outside.
Viserys
picked
up
the
cloak
and
sniffed
at
it.
“This
stinks
of
manure.
Perhaps
I
shall
use
it
as
a
horse
blanket.”

“I
had
Doreah
sew
it
specially
for
you,”
she
told
him,
wounded.
“These
are
garments
fit
for
a
khal.”

“I
am
the
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
not
some
grass-stained
savage
with
bells
in
his
hair,”
Viserys
spat
back
at
her.
He
grabbed
her
arm.
“You
forget
yourself,
slut.
Do
you
think
that
big
belly
will
protect
you
if
you
wake
the
dragon?”

His
fingers
dug
into
her
arm
painfully
and
for
an
instant
Dany
felt
like
a
child
again,
quailing
in
the
face
of
his
rage.
She
reached
out
with
her
other
hand
and
grabbed
the
first
thing
she
touched,
the
belt
she’d
hoped
to
give
him,
a
heavy
chain
of
ornate
bronze
medallions.
She
swung
it
with
all
her
strength.

It
caught
him
full
in
the
face.
Viserys
let
go
of
her.
Blood
ran
down
his
cheek
where
the
edge
of
one
of
the
medallions
had
sliced
it
open.
“You
are
the
one
who
forgets
himself,”
Dany
said
to
him.
“Didn’t
you
learn
anything
that
day
in
the
grass?
Leave
me
now,
before
I
summon
my
khas
to
drag
you
out.
And
pray
that
Khal
Drogo
does
not
hear
of
this,
or
he
will
cut
open
your
belly
and
feed
you
your
own
entrails.”

Viserys
scrambled
back
to
his
feet.
“When
I
come
into
my
kingdom,
you
will
rue
this
day,
slut.”
He
walked
off,
holding
his
torn
face,
leaving
her
gifts
behind
him.

Drops
of
his
blood
had
spattered
the
beautiful
sandsilk
cloak.
Dany
clutched
the
soft
cloth
to
her
cheek
and
sat
cross-legged
on
her
sleeping
mats.

“Your
supper
is
ready,
Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
announced.

“I’m
not
hungry,”
Dany
said
sadly.
She
was
suddenly
very
tired.
“Share
the
food
among
yourselves,
and
send
some
to
Ser
Jorah,
if
you
would.”
After
a
moment
she
added,
“Please,
bring
me
one
of
the
dragon’s
eggs.”

Irri
fetched
the
egg
with
the
deep
green
shell,
bronze
flecks
shining
amid
its
scales
as
she
turned
it
in
her
small
hands.
Dany
curled
up
on
her
side,
pulling
the
sandsilk
cloak
across
her
and
cradling
the
egg
in
the
hollow
between
her
swollen
belly
and
small,
tender
breasts.
She
liked
to
hold
them.
They
were
so
beautiful,
and
sometimes
just
being
close
to
them
made
her
feel
stronger,
braver,
as
if
somehow
she
were
drawing
strength
from
the
stone
dragons
locked
inside.

She
was
lying
there,
holding
the
egg,
when
she
felt
the
child
move
within
her…
as
if
he
were
reaching
out,
brother
to
brother,
blood
to
blood.
“You
are
the
dragon,”
Dany
whispered
to
him,
“the
true
dragon.
I
know
it.
I
know
it.”
And
she
smiled,
and
went
to
sleep
dreaming
of
home.





BRAN

A
light
snow
was
falling.
Bran
could
feel
the
flakes
on
his
face,
melting
as
they
touched
his
skin
like
the
gentlest
of
rains.
He
sat
straight
atop
his
horse,
watching
as
the
iron
portcullis
was
winched
upward.
Try
as
he
might
to
keep
calm,
his
heart
was
fluttering
in
his
chest.

“Are
you
ready?”
Robb
asked.

Bran
nodded,
trying
not
to
let
his
fear
show.
He
had
not
been
outside
Winterfell
since
his
fall,
but
he
was
determined
to
ride
out
as
proud
as
any
knight.

“Let’s
ride,
then.”
Robb
put
his
heels
into
his
big
grey-and-white
gelding,
and
the
horse
walked
under
the
portcullis.

“Go,”
Bran
whispered
to
his
own
horse.
He
touched
her
neck
lightly,
and
the
small
chestnut
filly
started
forward.
Bran
had
named
her
Dancer.
She
was
two
years
old,
and
Joseth
said
she
was
smarter
than
any
horse
had
a
right
to
be.
They
had
trained
her
special,
to
respond
to
rein
and
voice
and
touch.
Up
to
now,
Bran
had
only
ridden
her
around
the
yard.
At
first
Joseth
or
Hodor
would
lead
her,
while
Bran
sat
strapped
to
her
back
in
the
oversize
saddle
the
Imp
had
drawn
up
for
him,
but
for
the
past
fortnight
he
had
been
riding
her
on
his
own,
trotting
her
round
and
round,
and
growing
bolder
with
every
circuit.

They
passed
beneath
the
gatehouse,
over
the
drawbridge,
through
the
outer
walls.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
came
loping
beside
them,
sniffing
at
the
wind.
Close
behind
came
Theon
Greyjoy,
with
his
longbow
and
a
quiver
of
broadheads;
he
had
a
mind
to
take
a
deer,
he
had
told
them.
He
was
followed
by
four
guardsmen
in
mailed
shirts
and
coifs,
and
Joseth,
a
stick-thin
stableman
whom
Robb
had
named
master
of
horse
while
Hullen
was
away.
Maester
Luwin
brought
up
the
rear,
riding
on
a
donkey.
Bran
would
have
liked
it
better
if
he
and
Robb
had
gone
off
alone,
just
the
two
of
them,
but
Hal
Mollen
would
not
hear
of
it,
and
Maester
Luwin
backed
him.
If
Bran
fell
off
his
horse
or
injured
himself,
the
maester
was
determined
to
be
with
him.

Beyond
the
castle
lay
the
market
square,
its
wooden
stalls
deserted
now.
They
rode
down
the
muddy
streets
of
the
village,
past
rows
of
small
neat
houses
of
log
and
undressed
stone.
Less
than
one
in
five
were
occupied,
thin
tendrils
of
woodsmoke
curling
up
from
their
chimneys.
The
rest
would
fill
up
one
by
one
as
it
grew
colder.
When
the
snow
fell
and
the
ice
winds
howled
down
out
of
the
north,
Old
Nan
said,
farmers
left
their
frozen
fields
and
distant
holdfasts,
loaded
up
their
wagons,
and
then
the
winter
town
came
alive.
Bran
had
never
seen
it
happen,
but
Maester
Luwin
said
the
day
was
looming
closer.
The
end
of
the
long
summer
was
near
at
hand.
Winter
is
coming.

A
few
villagers
eyed
the
direwolves
anxiously
as
the
riders
went
past,
and
one
man
dropped
the
wood
he
was
carrying
as
he
shrank
away
in
fear,
but
most
of
the
townfolk
had
grown
used
to
the
sight.
They
bent
the
knee
when
they
saw
the
boys,
and
Robb
greeted
each
of
them
with
a
lordly
nod.

With
his
legs
unable
to
grip,
the
swaying
motion
of
the
horse
made
Bran
feel
unsteady
at
first,
but
the
huge
saddle
with
its
thick
horn
and
high
back
cradled
him
comfortingly,
and
the
straps
around
his
chest
and
thighs
would
not
allow
him
to
fall.
After
a
time
the
rhythm
began
to
feel
almost
natural.
His
anxiety
faded,
and
a
tremulous
smile
crept
across
his
face.

Two
serving
wenches
stood
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Smoking
Log,
the
local
alehouse.
When
Theon
Greyjoy
called
out
to
them,
the
younger
girl
turned
red
and
covered
her
face.
Theon
spurred
his
mount
to
move
up
beside
Robb.
“Sweet
Kyra,”
he
said
with
a
laugh.
“She
squirms
like
a
weasel
in
bed,
but
say
a
word
to
her
on
the
street,
and
she
blushes
pink
as
a
maid.
Did
I
ever
tell
you
about
the
night
that
she
and
Bessa—”

“Not
where
my
brother
can
hear,
Theon,”
Robb
warned
him
with
a
glance
at
Bran.

Bran
looked
away
and
pretended
not
to
have
heard,
but
he
could
feel
Greyjoy’s
eyes
on
him.
No
doubt
he
was
smiling.
He
smiled
a
lot,
as
if
the
world
were
a
secret
joke
that
only
he
was
clever
enough
to
understand.
Robb
seemed
to
admire
Theon
and
enjoy
his
company,
but
Bran
had
never
warmed
to
his
father’s
ward.

Robb
rode
closer.
“You
are
doing
well,
Bran.”

“I
want
to
go
faster,”
Bran
replied.

Robb
smiled.
“As
you
will.”
He
sent
his
gelding
into
a
trot.
The
wolves
raced
after
him.
Bran
snapped
the
reins
sharply,
and
Dancer
picked
up
her
pace.
He
heard
a
shout
from
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
the
hoofbeats
of
the
other
horses
behind
him.

Bran’s
cloak
billowed
out,
rippling
in
the
wind,
and
the
snow
seemed
to
rush
at
his
face.
Robb
was
well
ahead,
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
Bran
and
the
others
were
following.
He
snapped
the
reins
again.
Smooth
as
silk,
Dancer
slid
into
a
gallop.
The
distance
closed.
By
the
time
he
caught
Robb
on
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood,
two
miles
beyond
the
winter
town,
they
had
left
the
others
well
behind.
“I
can
ride!”
Bran
shouted,
grinning.
It
felt
almost
as
good
as
flying.

“I’d
race
you,
but
I
fear
you’d
win.”
Robb’s
tone
was
light
and
joking,
yet
Bran
could
tell
that
something
was
troubling
his
brother
underneath
the
smile.

“I
don’t
want
to
race.”
Bran
looked
around
for
the
direwolves.
Both
had
vanished
into
the
wood.
“Did
you
hear
Summer
howling
last
night?”

“Grey
Wind
was
restless
too,”
Robb
said.
His
auburn
hair
had
grown
shaggy
and
unkempt,
and
a
reddish
stubble
covered
his
jaw,
making
him
look
older
than
his
fifteen
years.
“Sometimes
I
think
they
know
things…
sense
things…”
Robb
sighed.
“I
never
know
how
much
to
tell
you,
Bran.
I
wish
you
were
older.”

“I’m
eight
now!”
Bran
said.
“Eight
isn’t
so
much
younger
than
fifteen,
and
I’m
the
heir
to
Winterfell,
after
you.”

“So
you
are.”
Robb
sounded
sad,
and
even
a
little
scared.
“Bran,
I
need
to
tell
you
something.
There
was
a
bird
last
night.
From
King’s
Landing.
Maester
Luwin
woke
me.”

Bran
felt
a
sudden
dread.
Dark
wings,
dark
words,
Old
Nan
always
said,
and
of
late
the
messenger
ravens
had
been
proving
the
truth
of
the
proverb.
When
Robb
wrote
to
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
the
bird
that
came
back
brought
word
that
Uncle
Benjen
was
still
missing.
Then
a
message
had
arrived
from
the
Eyrie,
from
Mother,
but
that
had
not
been
good
news
either.
She
did
not
say
when
she
meant
to
return,
only
that
she
had
taken
the
Imp
as
prisoner.
Bran
had
sort
of
liked
the
little
man,
yet
the
name
Lannister
sent
cold
fingers
creeping
up
his
spine.
There
was
something
about
the
Lannisters,
something
he
ought
to
remember,
but
when
he
tried
to
think
what,
he
felt
dizzy
and
his
stomach
clenched
hard
as
a
stone.
Robb
spent
most
of
that
day
locked
behind
closed
doors
with
Maester
Luwin,
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
Hallis
Mollen.
Afterward,
riders
were
sent
out
on
fast
horses,
carrying
Robb’s
commands
throughout
the
north.
Bran
heard
talk
of
Moat
Cailin,
the
ancient
stronghold
the
First
Men
had
built
at
the
top
of
the
Neck.
No
one
ever
told
him
what
was
happening,
yet
he
knew
it
was
not
good.

And
now
another
raven,
another
message.
Bran
clung
to
hope.
“Was
the
bird
from
Mother?
Is
she
coming
home?”

“The
message
was
from
Alyn
in
King’s
Landing.
Jory
Cassel
is
dead.
And
Wyl
and
Heward
as
well.
Murdered
by
the
Kingslayer.”
Robb
lifted
his
face
to
the
snow,
and
the
flakes
melted
on
his
cheeks.
“May
the
gods
give
them
rest.”

Bran
did
not
know
what
to
say.
He
felt
as
if
he’d
been
punched.
Jory
had
been
captain
of
the
household
guard
at
Winterfell
since
before
Bran
was
born.
“They
killed
Jory?”
He
remembered
all
the
times
Jory
had
chased
him
over
the
roofs.
He
could
picture
him
striding
across
the
yard
in
mail
and
plate,
or
sitting
at
his
accustomed
place
on
the
bench
in
the
Great
Hall,
joking
as
he
ate.
“Why
would
anyone
kill
Jory?”

Robb
shook
his
head
numbly,
the
pain
plain
in
his
eyes.
“I
don’t
know,
and…
Bran,
that’s
not
the
worst
of
it.
Father
was
caught
beneath
a
falling
horse
in
the
fight.
Alyn
says
his
leg
was
shattered,
and…
Maester
Pycelle
has
given
him
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
but
they
aren’t
sure
when…
when
he…”
The
sound
of
hoofbeats
made
him
glance
down
the
road,
to
where
Theon
and
the
others
were
coming
up.
“When
he
will
wake,”
Robb
finished.
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword
then,
and
went
on
in
the
solemn
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord.
“Bran,
I
promise
you,
whatever
might
happen,
I
will
not
let
this
be
forgotten.”

Something
in
his
tone
made
Bran
even
more
fearful.
“What
will
you
do?”
he
asked
as
Theon
Greyjoy
reined
in
beside
them.

“Theon
thinks
I
should
call
the
banners,”
Robb
said.

“Blood
for
blood.”
For
once
Greyjoy
did
not
smile.
His
lean,
dark
face
had
a
hungry
look
to
it,
and
black
hair
fell
down
across
his
eyes.

“Only
the
lord
can
call
the
banners,”
Bran
said
as
the
snow
drifted
down
around
them.

“If
your
father
dies,”
Theon
said,
“Robb
will
be
Lord
of
Winterfell.”

“He
won’t
die!”
Bran
screamed
at
him.

Robb
took
his
hand.
“He
won’t
die,
not
Father,”
he
said
calmly.
“Still…
the
honor
of
the
north
is
in
my
hands
now.
When
our
lord
father
took
his
leave
of
us,
he
told
me
to
be
strong
for
you
and
for
Rickon.
I’m
almost
a
man
grown,
Bran.”

Bran
shivered.
“I
wish
Mother
was
back,”
he
said
miserably.
He
looked
around
for
Maester
Luwin;
his
donkey
was
visible
in
the
far
distance,
trotting
over
a
rise.
“Does
Maester
Luwin
say
to
call
the
banners
too?”

“The
maester
is
timid
as
an
old
woman,”
said
Theon.

“Father
always
listened
to
his
counsel,”
Bran
reminded
his
brother.
“Mother
too.”

“I
listen
to
him,”
Robb
insisted.
“I
listen
to
everyone.”

The
joy
Bran
had
felt
at
the
ride
was
gone,
melted
away
like
the
snowflakes
on
his
face.
Not
so
long
ago,
the
thought
of
Robb
calling
the
banners
and
riding
off
to
war
would
have
filled
him
with
excitement,
but
now
he
felt
only
dread.
“Can
we
go
back
now?”
he
asked.
“I’m
cold.”

Robb
glanced
around.
“We
need
to
find
the
wolves.
Can
you
stand
to
go
a
bit
longer?”

“I
can
go
as
long
as
you
can.”
Maester
Luwin
had
warned
him
to
keep
the
ride
short,
for
fear
of
saddle
sores,
but
Bran
would
not
admit
to
weakness
in
front
of
his
brother.
He
was
sick
of
the
way
everyone
was
always
fussing
over
him
and
asking
how
he
was.

“Let’s
hunt
down
the
hunters,
then,”
Robb
said.
Side
by
side,
they
urged
their
mounts
off
the
kingsroad
and
struck
out
into
the
wolfswood.
Theon
dropped
back
and
followed
well
behind
them,
talking
and
joking
with
the
guardsmen.

It
was
nice
under
the
trees.
Bran
kept
Dancer
to
a
walk,
holding
the
reins
lightly
and
looking
all
around
him
as
they
went.
He
knew
this
wood,
but
he
had
been
so
long
confined
to
Winterfell
that
he
felt
as
though
he
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time.
The
smells
filled
his
nostrils;
the
sharp
fresh
tang
of
pine
needles,
the
earthy
odor
of
wet
rotting
leaves,
the
hints
of
animal
musk
and
distant
cooking
fires.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
squirrel
moving
through
the
snow-covered
branches
of
an
oak,
and
paused
to
study
the
silvery
web
of
an
empress
spider.

Theon
and
the
others
fell
farther
and
farther
behind,
until
Bran
could
no
longer
hear
their
voices.
From
ahead
came
the
faint
sound
of
rushing
waters.
It
grew
louder
until
they
reached
the
stream.
Tears
stung
his
eyes.

“Bran?”
Robb
asked.
“What’s
wrong?”

Bran
shook
his
head.
“I
was
just
remembering,”
he
said.
“Jory
brought
us
here
once,
to
fish
for
trout.
You
and
me
and
Jon.
Do
you
remember?”

“I
remember,”
Robb
said,
his
voice
quiet
and
sad.

“I
didn’t
catch
anything,”
Bran
said,
“but
Jon
gave
me
his
fish
on
the
way
back
to
Winterfell.
Will
we
ever
see
Jon
again?”

“We
saw
Uncle
Benjen
when
the
king
came
to
visit,”
Robb
pointed
out.
“Jon
will
visit
too,
you’ll
see.”

The
stream
was
running
high
and
fast.
Robb
dismounted
and
led
his
gelding
across
the
ford.
In
the
deepest
part
of
the
crossing,
the
water
came
up
to
midthigh.
He
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
on
the
far
side,
and
waded
back
across
for
Bran
and
Dancer.
The
current
foamed
around
rock
and
root,
and
Bran
could
feel
the
spray
on
his
face
as
Robb
led
him
over.
It
made
him
smile.
For
a
moment
he
felt
strong
again,
and
whole.
He
looked
up
at
the
trees
and
dreamed
of
climbing
them,
right
up
to
the
very
top,
with
the
whole
forest
spread
out
beneath
him.

They
were
on
the
far
side
when
they
heard
the
howl,
a
long
rising
wail
that
moved
through
the
trees
like
a
cold
wind.
Bran
raised
his
head
to
listen.
“Summer,”
he
said.
No
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
a
second
voice
joined
the
first.

“They’ve
made
a
kill,”
Robb
said
as
he
remounted.
“I’d
best
go
and
bring
them
back.
Wait
here,
Theon
and
the
others
should
be
along
shortly.”

“I
want
to
go
with
you,”
Bran
said.

“I’ll
find
them
faster
by
myself.”
Robb
spurred
his
gelding
and
vanished
into
the
trees.

Once
he
was
gone,
the
woods
seemed
to
close
in
around
Bran.
The
snow
was
falling
more
heavily
now.
Where
it
touched
the
ground
it
melted,
but
all
about
him
rock
and
root
and
branch
wore
a
thin
blanket
of
white.
As
he
waited,
he
was
conscious
of
how
uncomfortable
he
felt.
He
could
not
feel
his
legs,
hanging
useless
in
the
stirrups,
but
the
strap
around
his
chest
was
tight
and
chafing,
and
the
melting
snow
had
soaked
through
his
gloves
to
chill
his
hands.
He
wondered
what
was
keeping
Theon
and
Maester
Luwin
and
Joseth
and
the
rest.

When
he
heard
the
rustle
of
leaves,
Bran
used
the
reins
to
make
Dancer
turn,
expecting
to
see
his
friends,
but
the
ragged
men
who
stepped
out
onto
the
bank
of
the
stream
were
strangers.

“Good
day
to
you,”
he
said
nervously.
One
look,
and
Bran
knew
they
were
neither
foresters
nor
farmers.
He
was
suddenly
conscious
of
how
richly
he
was
dressed.
His
surcoat
was
new,
dark
grey
wool
with
silver
buttons,
and
a
heavy
silver
pin
fastened
his
fur-trimmed
cloak
at
the
shoulders.
His
boots
and
gloves
were
lined
with
fur
as
well.

“All
alone,
are
you?”
said
the
biggest
of
them,
a
bald
man
with
a
raw
windburnt
face.
“Lost
in
the
wolfswood,
poor
lad.”

“I’m
not
lost.”
Bran
did
not
like
the
way
the
strangers
were
looking
at
him.
He
counted
four,
but
when
he
turned
his
head,
he
saw
two
others
behind
him.
“My
brother
rode
off
just
a
moment
ago,
and
my
guard
will
be
here
shortly.”

“Your
guard,
is
it?”
a
second
man
said.
Grey
stubble
covered
his
gaunt
face.
“And
what
would
they
be
guarding,
my
little
lord?
Is
that
a
silver
pin
I
see
there
on
your
cloak?”

“Pretty,”
said
a
woman’s
voice.
She
scarcely
looked
like
a
woman;
tall
and
lean,
with
the
same
hard
face
as
the
others,
her
hair
hidden
beneath
a
bowl-shaped
halfhelm.
The
spear
she
held
was
eight
feet
of
black
oak,
tipped
in
rusted
steel.

“Let’s
have
a
look,”
said
the
big
bald
man.

Bran
watched
him
anxiously.
The
man’s
clothes
were
filthy,
fallen
almost
to
pieces,
patched
here
with
brown
and
here
with
blue
and
there
with
a
dark
green,
and
faded
everywhere
to
grey,
but
once
that
cloak
might
have
been
black.
The
grey
stubbly
man
wore
black
rags
too,
he
saw
with
a
sudden
start.
Suddenly
Bran
remembered
the
oathbreaker
his
father
had
beheaded,
the
day
they
had
found
the
wolf
pups;
that
man
had
worn
black
as
well,
and
Father
said
he
had
been
a
deserter
from
the
Night’s
Watch.
No
man
is
more
dangerous,
he
remembered
Lord
Eddard
saying.
The
deserter
knows
his
life
is
forfeit
if
he
is
taken,
so
he
will
not
flinch
from
any
crime,
no
matter
how
vile
or
cruel.

“The
pin,
lad,”
the
big
man
said.
He
held
out
his
hand.

“We’ll
take
the
horse
too,”
said
another
of
them,
a
woman
shorter
than
Robb,
with
a
broad
fiat
face
and
lank
yellow
hair.
“Get
down,
and
be
quick
about
it.”
A
knife
slid
from
her
sleeve
into
her
hand,
its
edge
jagged
as
a
saw.

“No,”
Bran
blurted.
“I
can’t…”

The
big
man
grabbed
his
reins
before
Bran
could
think
to
wheel
Dancer
around
and
gallop
off.
“You
can,
lordling…
and
will,
if
you
know
what’s
good
for
you.”

“Stiv,
look
how
he’s
strapped
on.”
The
tall
woman
pointed
with
her
spear.
“Might
be
it’s
the
truth
he’s
telling.”

“Straps,
is
it?”
Stiv
said.
He
drew
a
dagger
from
a
sheath
at
his
belt.
“There’s
ways
to
deal
with
straps.”

“You
some
kind
of
cripple?”
asked
the
short
woman.

Bran
flared.
“I’m
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
you
better
let
go
of
my
horse,
or
I’ll
see
you
all
dead.”

The
gaunt
man
with
the
grey
stubbled
face
laughed.
“The
boy’s
a
Stark,
true
enough.
Only
a
Stark
would
be
fool
enough
to
threaten
where
smarter
men
would
beg.”

“Cut
his
little
cock
off
and
stuff
it
in
his
mouth,”
suggested
the
short
woman.
“That
should
shut
him
up.”

“You’re
as
stupid
as
you
are
ugly,
Hali,”
said
the
tall
woman.
“The
boy’s
worth
nothing
dead,
but
alive…
gods
be
damned,
think
what
Mance
would
give
to
have
Benjen
Stark’s
own
blood
to
hostage!”

“Mance
be
damned,”
the
big
man
cursed.
“You
want
to
go
back
there,
Osha?
More
fool
you.
Think
the
white
walkers
will
care
if
you
have
a
hostage?”
He
turned
back
to
Bran
and
slashed
at
the
strap
around
his
thigh.
The
leather
parted
with
a
sigh.

The
stroke
had
been
quick
and
careless,
biting
deep.
Looking
down,
Bran
glimpsed
pale
flesh
where
the
wool
of
his
leggings
had
parted.
Then
the
blood
began
to
flow.
He
watched
the
red
stain
spread,
feeling
light-headed,
curiously
apart;
there
had
been
no
pain,
not
even
a
hint
of
feeling.
The
big
man
grunted
in
surprise.

“Put
down
your
steel
now,
and
I
promise
you
shall
have
a
quick
and
painless
death,”
Robb
called
out.

Bran
looked
up
in
desperate
hope,
and
there
he
was.
The
strength
of
the
words
were
undercut
by
the
way
his
voice
cracked
with
strain.
He
was
mounted,
the
bloody
carcass
of
an
elk
slung
across
the
back
of
his
horse,
his
sword
in
a
gloved
hand.

“The
brother,”
said
the
man
with
the
grey
stubbly
face.

“He’s
a
fierce
one,
he
is,”
mocked
the
short
woman.
Hali,
they
called
her.
“You
mean
to
fight
us,
boy?”

“Don’t
be
a
fool,
lad.
You’re
one
against
six.”
The
tall
woman,
Osha,
leveled
her
spear.
“Off
the
horse,
and
throw
down
the
sword.
We’ll
thank
you
kindly
for
the
mount
and
for
the
venison,
and
you
and
your
brother
can
be
on
your
way.”

Robb
whistled.
They
heard
the
faint
sound
of
soft
feet
on
wet
leaves.
The
undergrowth
parted,
low-hanging
branches
giving
up
their
accumulation
of
snow,
and
Grey
Wind
and
Summer
emerged
from
the
green.
Summer
sniffed
the
air
and
growled.

“Wolves,”
gasped
Hali.

“Direwolves,”
Bran
said.
Still
half-grown,
they
were
as
large
as
any
wolf
he
had
ever
seen,
but
the
differences
were
easy
to
spot,
if
you
knew
what
to
look
for.
Maester
Luwin
and
Farlen
the
kennelmaster
had
taught
him.
A
direwolf
had
a
bigger
head
and
longer
legs
in
proportion
to
its
body,
and
its
snout
and
jaw
were
markedly
leaner
and
more
pronounced.
There
was
something
gaunt
and
terrible
about
them
as
they
stood
there
amid
the
gently
falling
snow.
Fresh
blood
spotted
Grey
Wind’s
muzzle.

“Dogs,”
the
big
bald
man
said
contemptuously.
“Yet
I’m
told
there’s
nothing
like
a
wolfskin
cloak
to
warm
a
man
by
night.”
He
made
a
sharp
gesture.
“Take
them.”

Robb
shouted,
“Winterfell!”
and
kicked
his
horse.
The
gelding
plunged
down
the
bank
as
the
ragged
men
closed.
A
man
with
an
axe
rushed
in,
shouting
and
heedless.
Robb’s
sword
caught
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
sickening
crunch
and
a
spray
of
bright
blood.
The
man
with
the
gaunt
stubbly
face
made
a
grab
for
the
reins,
and
for
half
a
second
he
had
them…
and
then
Grey
Wind
was
on
him,
bearing
him
down.
He
fell
back
into
the
stream
with
a
splash
and
a
shout,
flailing
wildly
with
his
knife
as
his
head
went
under.
The
direwolf
plunged
in
after
him,
and
the
white
water
turned
red
where
they
had
vanished.

Robb
and
Osha
matched
blows
in
midstream.
Her
long
spear
was
a
steel-headed
serpent,
flashing
out
at
his
chest,
once,
twice,
three
times,
but
Robb
parried
every
thrust
with
his
longsword,
turning
the
point
aside.
On
the
fourth
or
fifth
thrust,
the
tall
woman
overextended
herself
and
lost
her
balance,
just
for
a
second.
Robb
charged,
riding
her
down.

A
few
feet
away,
Summer
darted
in
and
snapped
at
Hali.
The
knife
bit
at
his
flank.
Summer
slid
away,
snarling,
and
came
rushing
in
again.
This
time
his
jaws
closed
around
her
calf.
Holding
the
knife
with
both
hands,
the
small
woman
stabbed
down,
but
the
direwolf
seemed
to
sense
the
blade
coming.
He
pulled
free
for
an
instant,
his
mouth
full
of
leather
and
cloth
and
bloody
flesh.
When
Hali
stumbled
and
fell,
he
came
at
her
again,
slamming
her
backward,
teeth
tearing
at
her
belly.

The
sixth
man
ran
from
the
carnage…
but
not
far.
As
he
went
scrambling
up
the
far
side
of
the
bank,
Grey
Wind
emerged
from
the
stream,
dripping
wet.
He
shook
the
water
off
and
bounded
after
the
running
man,
hamstringing
him
with
a
single
snap
of
his
teeth,
and
going
for
the
throat
as
the
screaming
man
slid
back
down
toward
the
water.

And
then
there
was
no
one
left
but
the
big
man,
Stiv.
He
slashed
at
Bran’s
chest
strap,
grabbed
his
arm,
and
yanked.
Suddenly
Bran
was
falling.
He
sprawled
on
the
ground,
his
legs
tangled
under
him,
one
foot
in
the
stream.
He
could
not
feel
the
cold
of
the
water,
but
he
felt
the
steel
when
Stiv
pressed
his
dagger
to
his
throat.
“Back
away,”
the
man
warned,
“or
I’ll
open
the
boy’s
windpipe,
I
swear
it.”

Robb
reined
his
horse
in,
breathing
hard.
The
fury
went
out
of
his
eyes,
and
his
sword
arm
dropped.

In
that
moment
Bran
saw
everything.
Summer
was
savaging
Hali,
pulling
glistening
blue
snakes
from
her
belly.
Her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring.
Bran
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
alive
or
dead.
The
grey
stubbly
man
and
the
one
with
the
axe
lay
unmoving,
but
Osha
was
on
her
knees,
crawling
toward
her
fallen
spear.
Grey
Wind
padded
toward
her,
dripping
wet.
“Call
him
off!”
the
big
man
shouted.
“Call
them
both
off,
or
the
cripple
boy
dies
now!”

“Grey
Wind,
Summer,
to
me,”
Robb
said.

The
direwolves
stopped,
turned
their
heads.
Grey
Wind
loped
back
to
Robb.
Summer
stayed
where
he
was,
his
eyes
on
Bran
and
the
man
beside
him.
He
growled.
His
muzzle
was
wet
and
red,
but
his
eyes
burned.

Osha
used
the
butt
end
of
her
spear
to
lever
herself
back
to
her
feet.
Blood
leaked
from
a
wound
on
the
upper
arm
where
Robb
had
cut
her.
Bran
could
see
sweat
trickling
down
the
big
man’s
face.
Stiv
was
as
scared
as
he
was,
he
realized.
“Starks,”
the
man
muttered,
“bloody
Starks.”
He
raised
his
voice.
“Osha,
kill
the
wolves
and
get
his
sword.”

“Kill
them
yourself,”
she
replied.
“I’ll
not
be
getting
near
those
monsters.”

For
a
moment
Stiv
was
at
a
loss.
His
hand
trembled;
Bran
felt
a
trickle
of
blood
where
the
knife
pressed
against
his
neck.
The
stench
of
the
man
filled
his
nose;
he
smelled
of
fear.
“You,”
he
called
out
to
Robb.
“You
have
a
name?”

“I
am
Robb
Stark,
the
heir
to
Winterfell.”

“This
is
your
brother?”

“Yes.”

“You
want
him
alive,
you
do
what
I
say.
Off
the
horse.”

Robb
hesitated
a
moment.
Then,
slowly
and
deliberately,
he
dismounted
and
stood
with
his
sword
in
hand.

“Now
kill
the
wolves.”

Robb
did
not
move.

“You
do
it.
The
wolves
or
the
boy.”

“No!”
Bran
screamed.
If
Robb
did
as
they
asked,
Stiv
would
kill
them
both
anyway,
once
the
direwolves
were
dead.

The
bald
man
took
hold
of
his
hair
with
his
free
hand
and
twisted
it
cruelly,
till
Bran
sobbed
in
pain.
“You
shut
your
mouth,
cripple,
you
hear
me?”
He
twisted
harder.
“You
hear
me?”

A
low
thrum
came
from
the
woods
behind
them.
Stiv
gave
a
choked
gasp
as
a
half
foot
of
razor-tipped
broadhead
suddenly
exploded
out
of
his
chest.
The
arrow
was
bright
red,
as
if
it
had
been
painted
in
blood.

The
dagger
fell
away
from
Bran’s
throat.
The
big
man
swayed
and
collapsed,
facedown
in
the
stream.
The
arrow
broke
beneath
him.
Bran
watched
his
life
go
swirling
off
in
the
water.

Osha
glanced
around
as
Father’s
guardsmen
appeared
from
beneath
the
trees,
steel
in
hand.
She
threw
down
her
spear.
“Mercy,
m’lord,”
she
called
to
Robb.

The
guardsmen
had
a
strange,
pale
look
to
their
faces
as
they
took
in
the
scene
of
slaughter.
They
eyed
the
wolves
uncertainly,
and
when
Summer
returned
to
Hali’s
corpse
to
feed,
Joseth
dropped
his
knife
and
scrambled
for
the
bush,
heaving.
Even
Maester
Luwin
seemed
shocked
as
he
stepped
from
behind
a
tree,
but
only
for
an
instant.
Then
he
shook
his
head
and
waded
across
the
stream
to
Bran’s
side.
“Are
you
hurt?”

“He
cut
my
leg,”
Bran
said,
“but
I
couldn’t
feel
it.”

As
the
maester
knelt
to
examine
the
wound,
Bran
turned
his
head.
Theon
Greyjoy
stood
beside
a
sentinel
tree,
his
bow
in
hand.
He
was
smiling.
Ever
smiling.
A
half-dozen
arrows
were
thrust
into
the
soft
ground
at
his
feet,
but
it
had
taken
only
one.
“A
dead
enemy
is
a
thing
of
beauty,”
he
announced.

“Jon
always
said
you
were
an
ass,
Greyjoy,”
Robb
said
loudly.
“I
ought
to
chain
you
up
in
the
yard
and
let
Bran
take
a
few
practice
shots
at
you.”

“You
should
be
thanking
me
for
saving
your
brother’s
life.”

“What
if
you
had
missed
the
shot?”
Robb
said.
“What
if
you’d
only
wounded
him?
What
if
you
had
made
his
hand
jump,
or
hit
Bran
instead?
For
all
you
knew,
the
man
might
have
been
wearing
a
breastplate,
all
you
could
see
was
the
back
of
his
cloak.
What
would
have
happened
to
my
brother
then?
Did
you
ever
think
of
that,
Greyjoy?”

Theon’s
smile
was
gone.
He
gave
a
sullen
shrug
and
began
to
pull
his
arrows
from
the
ground,
one
by
one.

Robb
glared
at
his
guardsmen.
“Where
were
you?”
he
demanded
of
them.
“I
was
sure
you
were
close
behind
us.”

The
men
traded
unhappy
glances.
“We
were
following,
m’lord,”
said
Quent,
the
youngest
of
them,
his
beard
a
soft
brown
fuzz.
“Only
first
we
waited
for
Maester
Luwin
and
his
ass,
begging
your
pardons,
and
then,
well,
as
it
were…”
He
glanced
over
at
Theon
and
quickly
looked
away,
abashed.

“I
spied
a
turkey,”
Theon
said,
annoyed
by
the
question.
“How
was
I
to
know
that
you’d
leave
the
boy
alone?”

Robb
turned
his
head
to
look
at
Theon
once
more.
Bran
had
never
seen
him
so
angry,
yet
he
said
nothing.
Finally
he
knelt
beside
Maester
Luwin.
“How
badly
is
my
brother
wounded?”

“No
more
than
a
scratch,”
the
maester
said.
He
wet
a
cloth
in
the
stream
to
clean
the
cut.
“Two
of
them
wear
the
black,”
he
told
Robb
as
he
worked.

Robb
glanced
over
at
where
Stiv
lay
sprawled
in
the
stream,
his
ragged
black
cloak
moving
fitfully
as
the
rushing
waters
tugged
at
it.
“Deserters
from
the
Night’s
Watch,”
he
said
grimly.
“They
must
have
been
fools,
to
come
so
close
to
Winterfell.”

“Folly
and
desperation
are
ofttimes
hard
to
tell
apart,”
said
Maester
Luwin.

“Shall
we
bury
them,
m’lord?”
asked
Quent.

“They
would
not
have
buried
us,”
Robb
said.
“Hack
off
their
heads,
we’ll
send
them
back
to
the
Wall.
Leave
the
rest
for
the
carrion
crows.”

“And
this
one?”
Quent
jerked
a
thumb
toward
Osha.

Robb
walked
over
to
her.
She
was
a
head
taller
than
he
was,
but
she
dropped
to
her
knees
at
his
approach.
“Give
me
my
life,
m’lord
of
Stark,
and
I
am
yours.”

“Mine?
What
would
I
do
with
an
oathbreaker?”

“I
broke
no
oaths.
Stiv
and
Wallen
flew
down
off
the
Wall,
not
me.
The
black
crows
got
no
place
for
women.”

Theon
Greyjoy
sauntered
closer.
“Give
her
to
the
wolves,”
he
urged
Robb.
The
woman’s
eyes
went
to
what
was
left
of
Hali,
and
just
as
quickly
away.
She
shuddered.
Even
the
guardsmen
looked
queasy.

“She’s
a
woman,”
Robb
said.

“A
wildling,”
Bran
told
him.
“She
said
they
should
keep
me
alive
so
they
could
take
me
to
Mance
Rayder.”

“Do
you
have
a
name?”
Robb
asked
her.

“Osha,
as
it
please
the
lord,”
she
muttered
sourly.

Maester
Luwin
stood.
“We
might
do
well
to
question
her.”

Bran
could
see
the
relief
on
his
brother’s
face.
“As
you
say,
Maester.
Wayn,
bind
her
hands.
She’ll
come
back
to
Winterfell
with
us…
and
live
or
die
by
the
truths
she
gives
us.”





TYRION

“You
want
eat?”
Mord
asked,
glowering.
He
had
a
plate
of
oiled
beans
in
one
thick,
stub-fingered
hand.

Tyrion
Lannister
was
starved,
but
he
refused
to
let
this
brute
see
him
cringe.
“A
leg
of
lamb
would
be
pleasant,”
he
said,
from
the
heap
of
soiled
straw
in
the
corner
of
his
cell.
“Perhaps
a
dish
of
peas
and
onions,
some
fresh
baked
bread
with
butter,
and
a
flagon
of
mulled
wine
to
wash
it
down.
Or
beer,
if
that’s
easier.
I
try
not
to
be
overly
particular.”

“Is
beans,”
Mord
said.
“Here.”
He
held
out
the
plate.

Tyrion
sighed.
The
turnkey
was
twenty
stone
of
gross
stupidity,
with
brown
rotting
teeth
and
small
dark
eyes.
The
left
side
of
his
face
was
slick
with
scar
where
an
axe
had
cut
off
his
ear
and
part
of
his
cheek.
He
was
as
predictable
as
he
was
ugly,
but
Tyrion
was
hungry.
He
reached
up
for
the
plate.

Mord
jerked
it
away,
grinning.
“Is
here,”
he
said,
holding
it
out
beyond
Tyrion’s
reach.

The
dwarf
climbed
stiffly
to
his
feet,
every
joint
aching.
“Must
we
play
the
same
fool’s
game
with
every
meal?”
He
made
another
grab
for
the
beans.

Mord
shambled
backward,
grinning
through
his
rotten
teeth.
“Is
here,
dwarf
man.”
He
held
the
plate
out
at
arm’s
length,
over
the
edge
where
the
cell
ended
and
the
sky
began.
“You
not
want
eat?
Here.
Come
take.”

Tyrion’s
arms
were
too
short
to
reach
the
plate,
and
he
was
not
about
to
step
that
close
to
the
edge.
All
it
would
take
would
be
a
quick
shove
of
Mord’s
heavy
white
belly,
and
he
would
end
up
a
sickening
red
splotch
on
the
stones
of
Sky,
like
so
many
other
prisoners
of
the
Eyrie
over
the
centuries.
“Come
to
think
on
it,
I’m
not
hungry
after
all,”
he
declared,
retreating
to
the
corner
of
his
cell.

Mord
grunted
and
opened
his
thick
fingers.
The
wind
took
the
plate,
flipping
it
over
as
it
fell.
A
handful
of
beans
sprayed
back
at
them
as
the
food
tumbled
out
of
sight.
The
turnkey
laughed,
his
gut
shaking
like
a
bowl
of
pudding.

Tyrion
felt
a
pang
of
rage.
“You
fucking
son
of
a
pox-ridden
ass,”
he
spat.
“I
hope
you
die
of
a
bloody
flux.”

For
that,
Mord
gave
him
a
kick,
driving
a
steel-toed
boot
hard
into
Tyrion’s
ribs
on
the
way
out.
“I
take
it
back!”
he
gasped
as
he
doubled
over
on
the
straw.
“I’ll
kill
you
myself,
I
swear
it!”
The
heavy
iron-bound
door
slammed
shut.
Tyrion
heard
the
rattle
of
keys.

For
a
small
man,
he
had
been
cursed
with
a
dangerously
big
mouth,
he
reflected
as
he
crawled
back
to
his
corner
of
what
the
Arryns
laughably
called
their
dungeon.
He
huddled
beneath
the
thin
blanket
that
was
his
only
bedding,
staring
out
at
a
blaze
of
empty
blue
sky
and
distant
mountains
that
seemed
to
go
on
forever,
wishing
he
still
had
the
shadowskin
cloak
he’d
won
from
Marillion
at
dice,
after
the
singer
had
stolen
it
off
the
body
of
that
brigand
chief.
The
skin
had
smelled
of
blood
and
mold,
but
it
was
warm
and
thick.
Mord
had
taken
it
the
moment
he
laid
eyes
on
it.

The
wind
tugged
at
his
blanket
with
gusts
sharp
as
talons.
His
cell
was
miserably
small,
even
for
a
dwarf.
Not
five
feet
away,
where
a
wall
ought
to
have
been,
where
a
wall
would
be
in
a
proper
dungeon,
the
floor
ended
and
the
sky
began.
He
had
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine,
and
the
moon
and
stars
by
night,
but
Tyrion
would
have
traded
it
all
in
an
instant
for
the
dankest,
gloomiest
pit
in
the
bowels
of
the
Casterly
Rock.

“You
fly,”
Mord
had
promised
him,
when
he’d
shoved
him
into
the
cell.
“Twenty
day,
thirty,
fifty
maybe.
Then
you
fly.”

The
Arryns
kept
the
only
dungeon
in
the
realm
where
the
prisoners
were
welcome
to
escape
at
will.
That
first
day,
after
girding
up
his
courage
for
hours,
Tyrion
had
lain
flat
on
his
stomach
and
squirmed
to
the
edge,
to
poke
out
his
head
and
look
down.
Sky
was
six
hundred
feet
below,
with
nothing
between
but
empty
air.
If
he
craned
his
neck
out
as
far
as
it
could
go,
he
could
see
other
cells
to
his
right
and
left
and
above
him.
He
was
a
bee
in
a
stone
honeycomb,
and
someone
had
torn
off
his
wings.

It
was
cold
in
the
cell,
the
wind
screamed
night
and
day,
and
worst
of
all,
the
floor
sloped.
Ever
so
slightly,
yet
it
was
enough.
He
was
afraid
to
close
his
eyes,
afraid
that
he
might
roll
over
in
his
steep
and
wake
in
sudden
terror
as
he
went
sliding
off
the
edge.
Small
wonder
the
sky
cells
drove
men
mad.

Gods
save
me,
some
previous
tenant
had
written
on
the
wall
in
something
that
looked
suspiciously
like
blood,
the
blue
is
calling.
At
first
Tyrion
wondered
who
he’d
been,
and
what
had
become
of
him;
later,
he
decided
that
he
would
rather
not
know.

If
only
he
had
shut
his
mouth…

The
wretched
boy
had
started
it,
looking
down
on
him
from
a
throne
of
carved
weirwood
beneath
the
moon-and-falcon
banners
of
House
Arryn.
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
looked
down
on
all
his
life,
but
seldom
by
rheumy-eyed
six-year-olds
who
needed
to
stuff
fat
cushions
under
their
cheeks
to
lift
them
to
the
height
of
a
man.
“Is
he
the
bad
man?”
the
boy
had
asked,
clutching
his
doll.

“He
is,”
the
Lady
Lysa
had
said
from
the
lesser
throne
beside
him.
She
was
all
in
blue,
powdered
and
perfumed
for
the
suitors
who
filled
her
court.

“He’s
so
small,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
said,
giggling.

“This
is
Tyrion
the
Imp,
of
House
Lannister,
who
murdered
your
father.”
She
raised
her
voice
so
it
carried
down
the
length
of
High
Hall
of
the
Eyrie,
ringing
off
the
milk-white
walls
and
the
slender
pillars,
so
every
man
could
hear
it.
“He
slew
the
Hand
of
the
King!”

“Oh,
did
I
kill
him
too?”
Tyrion
had
said,
like
a
fool.

That
would
have
been
a
very
good
time
to
have
kept
his
mouth
closed
and
his
head
bowed.
He
could
see
that
now;
seven
hells,
he
had
seen
it
then.
The
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns
was
long
and
austere,
with
a
forbidding
coldness
to
its
walls
of
blue-veined
white
marble,
but
the
faces
around
him
had
been
colder
by
far.
The
power
of
Casterly
Rock
was
far
away,
and
there
were
no
friends
of
the
Lannisters
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn.
Submission
and
silence
would
have
been
his
best
defenses.

But
Tyrion’s
mood
had
been
too
foul
for
sense.
To
his
shame,
he
had
faltered
during
the
last
leg
of
their
day-long
climb
up
to
the
Eyrie,
his
stunted
legs
unable
to
take
him
any
higher.
Bronn
had
carried
him
the
rest
of
the
way,
and
the
humiliation
poured
oil
on
the
flames
of
his
anger.
“It
would
seem
I’ve
been
a
busy
little
fellow,”
he
said
with
bitter
sarcasm.
“I
wonder
when
I
found
the
time
to
do
all
this
slaying
and
murdering.”

He
ought
to
have
remembered
who
he
was
dealing
with.
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
half-sane
weakling
son
had
not
been
known
at
court
for
their
love
of
wit,
especially
when
it
was
directed
at
them.

“Imp,”
Lysa
said
coldly,
“you
will
guard
that
mocking
tongue
of
yours
and
speak
to
my
son
politely,
or
I
promise
you
will
have
cause
to
regret
it.
Remember
where
you
are.
This
is
the
Eyrie,
and
these
are
knights
of
the
Vale
you
see
around
you,
true
men
who
loved
Jon
Arryn
well.
Every
one
of
them
would
die
for
me.”

“Lady
Arryn,
should
any
harm
come
to
me,
my
brother
Jaime
will
be
pleased
to
see
that
they
do.”
Even
as
he
spat
out
the
words,
Tyrion
knew
they
were
folly.

“Can
you
fly,
my
lord
of
Lannister?”
Lady
Lysa
asked.
“Does
a
dwarf
have
wings?
If
not,
you
would
be
wiser
to
swallow
the
next
threat
that
comes
to
mind.”

“I
made
no
threats,”
Tyrion
said.
“That
was
a
promise.”

Little
Lord
Robert
hopped
to
his
feet
at
that,
so
upset
he
dropped
his
doll.
“You
can’t
hurt
us,”
he
screamed.
“No
one
can
hurt
us
here.
Tell
him,
Mother,
tell
him
he
can’t
hurt
us
here.”
The
boy
began
to
twitch.

“The
Eyrie
is
impregnable,”
Lysa
Arryn
declared
calmly.
She
drew
her
son
close,
holding
him
safe
in
the
circle
of
her
plump
white
arms.
“The
Imp
is
trying
to
frighten
us,
sweet
baby.
The
Lannisters
are
all
liars.
No
one
will
hurt
my
sweet
boy.”

The
hell
of
it
was,
she
was
no
doubt
right.
Having
seen
what
it
took
to
get
here,
Tyrion
could
well
imagine
how
it
would
be
for
a
knight
trying
to
fight
his
way
up
in
armor,
while
stones
and
arrows
poured
down
from
above
and
enemies
contested
with
him
for
every
step.
Nightmare
did
not
begin
to
describe
it.
Small
wonder
the
Eyrie
had
never
been
taken.

Still,
Tyrion
had
been
unable
to
silence
himself.
“Not
impregnable,”
he
said,
“merely
inconvenient.”

Young
Robert
pointed
down,
his
hand
trembling.
“You’re
a
liar.
Mother,
I
want
to
see
him
fly.”
Two
guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
seized
Tyrion
by
the
arms,
lifting
him
off
his
floor.

The
gods
only
know
what
might
have
happened
then
were
it
not
for
Catelyn
Stark.
“Sister,”
she
called
out
from
where
she
stood
below
the
thrones,
“I
beg
you
to
remember,
this
man
is
my
prisoner.
I
will
not
have
him
harmed.”

Lysa
Arryn
glanced
at
her
sister
coolly
for
a
moment,
then
rose
and
swept
down
on
Tyrion,
her
long
skirts
trailing
after
her.
For
an
instant
he
feared
she
would
strike
him,
but
instead
she
commanded
them
to
release
him.
Her
men
shoved
him
to
the
floor,
his
legs
went
out
from
under
him,
and
Tyrion
fell.

He
must
have
made
quite
a
sight
as
he
struggled
to
his
knees,
only
to
feel
his
right
leg
spasm,
sending
him
sprawling
once
more.
Laughter
boomed
up
and
down
the
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns.

“My
sister’s
little
guest
is
too
weary
to
stand,”
Lady
Lysa
announced.
“Ser
Vardis,
take
him
down
to
the
dungeon.
A
rest
in
one
of
our
sky
cells
will
do
him
much
good.”

The
guardsmen
jerked
him
upright.
Tyrion
Lannister
dangled
between
them,
kicking
feebly,
his
face
red
with
shame.
“I
will
remember
this,”
he
told
them
all
as
they
carried
him
off.

And
so
he
did,
for
all
the
good
it
did
him.

At
first
he
had
consoled
himself
that
this
imprisonment
could
not
last
long.
Lysa
Arryn
wanted
to
humble
him,
that
was
all.
She
would
send
for
him
again,
and
soon.
If
not
her,
then
Catelyn
Stark
would
want
to
question
him.
This
time
he
would
guard
his
tongue
more
closely.
They
dare
not
kill
him
out
of
hand;
he
was
still
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
if
they
shed
his
blood,
it
would
mean
war.
Or
so
he
had
told
himself.

Now
he
was
not
so
certain.

Perhaps
his
captors
only
meant
to
let
him
rot
here,
but
he
feared
he
did
not
have
the
strength
to
rot
for
long.
He
was
growing
weaker
every
day,
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
Mord’s
kicks
and
blows
did
him
serious
harm,
provided
the
gaoler
did
not
starve
him
to
death
first.
A
few
more
nights
of
cold
and
hunger,
and
the
blue
would
start
calling
to
him
too.

He
wondered
what
was
happening
beyond
the
walls
(such
as
they
were)
of
his
cell.
Lord
Tywin
would
surely
have
sent
out
riders
when
the
word
reached
him.
Jaime
might
be
leading
a
host
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
even
now…
unless
he
was
riding
north
against
Winterfell
instead.
Did
anyone
outside
the
Vale
even
suspect
where
Catelyn
Stark
had
taken
him?
He
wondered
what
Cersei
would
do
when
she
heard.
The
king
could
order
him
freed,
but
would
Robert
listen
to
his
queen
or
his
Hand?
Tyrion
had
no
illusions
about
the
king’s
love
for
his
sister.

If
Cersei
kept
her
wits
about
her,
she
would
insist
the
king
sit
in
judgment
of
Tyrion
himself.
Even
Ned
Stark
could
scarcely
object
to
that,
not
without
impugning
the
honor
of
the
king.
And
Tyrion
would
be
only
too
glad
to
take
his
chances
in
a
trial.
Whatever
murders
they
might
lay
at
his
door,
the
Starks
had
no
proof
of
anything
so
far
as
he
could
see.
Let
them
make
their
case
before
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
lords
of
the
land.
It
would
be
the
end
of
them.
If
only
Cersei
were
clever
enough
to
see
that…

Tyrion
Lannister
sighed.
His
sister
was
not
without
a
certain
low
cunning,
but
her
pride
blinded
her.
She
would
see
the
insult
in
this,
not
the
opportunity.
And
Jaime
was
even
worse,
rash
and
headstrong
and
quick
to
anger.
His
brother
never
untied
a
knot
when
he
could
slash
it
in
two
with
his
sword.

He
wondered
which
of
them
had
sent
the
footpad
to
silence
the
Stark
boy,
and
whether
they
had
truly
conspired
at
the
death
of
Lord
Arryn.
If
the
old
Hand
had
been
murdered,
it
was
deftly
and
subtly
done.
Men
of
his
age
died
of
sudden
illness
all
the
time.
In
contrast,
sending
some
oaf
with
a
stolen
knife
after
Brandon
Stark
struck
him
as
unbelievably
clumsy.
And
wasn’t
that
peculiar,
come
to
think
on
it…

Tyrion
shivered.
Now
there
was
a
nasty
suspicion.
Perhaps
the
direwolf
and
the
lion
were
not
the
only
beasts
in
the
woods,
and
if
that
was
true,
someone
was
using
him
as
a
catspaw.
Tyrion
Lannister
hated
being
used.

He
would
have
to
get
out
of
here,
and
soon.
His
chances
of
overpowering
Mord
were
small
to
none,
and
no
one
was
about
to
smuggle
him
a
six-hundred-foot-long
rope,
so
he
would
have
to
talk
himself
free.
His
mouth
had
gotten
him
into
this
cell;
it
could
damn
well
get
him
out.

Tyrion
pushed
himself
to
his
feet,
doing
his
best
to
ignore
the
slope
of
the
floor
beneath
him,
with
its
ever-so-subtle
tug
toward
the
edge.
He
hammered
on
the
door
with
a
fist.
“Mord!”
he
shouted.
“Turnkey!
Mord,
I
want
you!”
He
had
to
keep
it
up
a
good
ten
minutes
before
he
heard
footsteps.
Tyrion
stepped
back
an
instant
before
the
door
opened
with
a
crash.

“Making
noise,”
Mord
growled,
with
blood
in
his
eyes.
Dangling
from
one
meaty
hand
was
a
leather
strap,
wide
and
thick,
doubled
over
in
his
fist.

Never
show
them
you’re
afraid,
Tyrion
reminded
himself.
“How
would
you
like
to
be
rich?”
he
asked.

Mord
hit
him.
He
swung
the
strap
backhand,
lazily,
but
the
leather
caught
Tyrion
high
on
the
arm.
The
force
of
it
staggered
him,
and
the
pain
made
him
grit
his
teeth.
“No
mouth,
dwarf
man,”
Mord
warned
him.

“Gold,”
Tyrion
said,
miming
a
smile.
“Casterly
Rock
is
full
of
gold…
ahhhh…”
This
time
the
blow
was
a
forehand,
and
Mord
put
more
of
his
arm
into
the
swing,
making
the
leather
crack
and
jump.
It
caught
Tyrion
in
the
ribs
and
dropped
him
to
his
knees,
wimpering.
He
forced
himself
to
look
up
at
the
gaoler.
“As
rich
as
the
Lannisters,”
he
wheezed.
“That’s
what
they
say,
Mord—”

Mord
grunted.
The
strap
whistled
through
the
air
and
smashed
Tyrion
full
in
the
face.
The
pain
was
so
bad
he
did
not
remember
falling,
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
was
on
the
floor
of
his
cell.
His
ear
was
ringing,
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood.
He
groped
for
purchase,
to
push
himself
up,
and
his
fingers
brushed
against…
nothing.
Tyrion
snatched
his
hand
back
as
fast
as
if
it
had
been
scalded,
and
tried
his
best
to
stop
breathing.
He
had
fallen
right
on
the
edge,
inches
from
the
blue.

“More
to
say?”
Mord
held
the
strap
between
his
fists
and
gave
it
a
sharp
pull.
The
snap
made
Tyrion
jump.
The
turnkey
laughed.

He
won’t
push
me
over,
Tyrion
told
himself
desperately
as
he
crawled
away
from
the
edge.
Catelyn
Stark
wants
me
alive,
he
doesn’t
dare
kill
me.
He
wiped
the
blood
off
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand,
grinned,
and
said,
“That
was
a
stiff
one,
Mord.”
The
gaoler
squinted
at
him,
trying
to
decide
if
he
was
being
mocked.
“I
could
make
good
use
of
a
strong
man
like
you.”
The
strap
flew
at
him,
but
this
time
Tyrion
was
able
to
cringe
away
from
it.
He
took
a
glancing
blow
to
the
shoulder,
nothing
more.
“Gold,”
he
repeated,
scrambling
backward
like
a
crab,
“more
gold
than
you’ll
see
here
in
a
lifetime.
Enough
to
buy
land,
women,
horses…
you
could
be
a
lord.
Lord
Mord.”
Tyrion
hawked
up
a
glob
of
blood
and
phlegm
and
spat
it
out
into
the
sky.

“Is
no
gold,”
Mord
said.

He’s
listening!
Tyrion
thought.
“They
relieved
me
of
my
purse
when
they
captured
me,
but
the
gold
is
still
mine.
Catelyn
Stark
might
take
a
man
prisoner,
but
she’d
never
stoop
to
rob
him.
That
wouldn’t
be
honorable.
Help
me,
and
all
the
gold
is
yours.”
Mord’s
strap
licked
out,
but
it
was
a
halfhearted,
desultory
swing,
slow
and
contemptuous.
Tyrion
caught
the
leather
in
his
hand
and
held
it
prisoned.
“There
will
be
no
risk
to
you.
All
you
need
do
is
deliver
a
message.”

The
gaoler
yanked
his
leather
strap
free
of
Tyrion’s
grasp.
“Message,”
he
said,
as
if
he
had
never
heard
the
word
before.
His
frown
made
deep
creases
in
his
brow.

“You
heard
me,
my
lord.
Only
carry
my
word
to
your
lady.
Tell
her…”
What?
What
would
possibly
make
Lysa
Anyn
relent?
The
inspiration
came
to
Tyrion
Lannister
suddenly.
“…tell
her
that
I
wish
to
confess
my
crimes.”

Mord
raised
his
arm
and
Tyrion
braced
himself
for
another
blow,
but
the
turnkey
hesitated.
Suspicion
and
greed
warred
in
his
eyes.
He
wanted
that
gold,
yet
he
feared
a
trick;
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
often
been
tricked.
“Is
lie,”
he
muttered
darkly.
“Dwarf
man
cheat
me.”

“I
will
put
my
promise
in
writing,”
Tyrion
vowed.

Some
illiterates
held
writing
in
disdain;
others
seemed
to
have
a
superstitious
reverence
for
the
written
word,
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic.
Fortunately,
Mord
was
one
of
the
latter.
The
turnkey
lowered
the
strap.
“Writing
down
gold.
Much
gold.”

“Oh,
much
gold,”
Tyrion
assured
him.
“The
purse
is
just
a
taste,
my
friend.
My
brother
wears
armor
of
solid
gold
plate.”
In
truth,
Jaime’s
armor
was
gilded
steel,
but
this
oaf
would
never
know
the
difference.

Mord
fingered
his
strap
thoughtfully,
but
in
the
end,
he
relented
and
went
to
fetch
paper
and
ink.
When
the
letter
was
written,
the
gaoler
frowned
at
it
suspiciously.
“Now
deliver
my
message,”
Tyrion
urged.

He
was
shivering
in
his
sleep
when
they
came
for
him,
late
that
night.
Mord
opened
the
door
but
kept
his
silence.
Ser
Vardis
Egen
woke
Tyrion
with
the
point
of
his
boot.
“On
your
feet,
Imp.
My
lady
wants
to
see
you.”

Tyrion
rubbed
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
and
put
on
a
grimace
he
scarcely
felt.
“No
doubt
she
does,
but
what
makes
you
think
I
wish
to
see
her?”

Ser
Vardis
frowned.
Tyrion
remembered
him
well
from
the
years
he
had
spent
at
King’s
Landing
as
the
captain
of
the
Hand’s
household
guard.
A
square,
plain
face,
silver
hair,
a
heavy
build,
and
no
humor
whatsoever.
“Your
wishes
are
not
my
concern.
On
your
feet,
or
I’ll
have
you
carried.”

Tyrion
clambered
awkwardly
to
his
feet.
“A
cold
night,”
he
said
casually,
“and
the
High
Hall
is
so
drafty.
I
don’t
wish
to
catch
a
chill.
Mord,
if
you
would
be
so
good,
fetch
my
cloak.”

The
gaoler
squinted
at
him,
face
dull
with
suspicion.

“My
cloak,”
Tyrion
repeated.
“The
shadowskin
you
took
from
me
for
safekeeping.
You
recall.”

“Get
him
the
damnable
cloak,”
Ser
Vardis
said.

Mord
did
not
dare
grumble.
He
gave
Tyrion
a
glare
that
promised
future
retribution,
yet
he
went
for
the
cloak.
When
he
draped
it
around
his
prisoner’s
neck,
Tyrion
smiled.
“My
thanks.
I
shall
think
of
you
whenever
I
wear
it.”
He
flung
the
trailing
end
of
the
long
fur
over
his
right
shoulder,
and
felt
warm
for
the
first
time
in
days.
“Lead
on,
Ser
Vardis.”

The
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns
was
aglow
with
the
light
of
fifty
torches,
burning
in
the
sconces
along
the
walls.
The
Lady
Lysa
wore
black
silk,
with
the
moon-and-falcon
sewn
on
her
breast
in
pearls.
Since
she
did
not
look
the
sort
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch,
Tyrion
could
only
imagine
that
she
had
decided
mourning
clothes
were
appropriate
garb
for
a
confession.
Her
long
auburn
hair,
woven
into
an
elaborate
braid,
fell
across
her
left
shoulder.
The
taller
throne
beside
her
was
empty;
no
doubt
the
little
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
was
off
shaking
in
his
sleep.
Tyrion
was
thankful
for
that
much,
at
least.

He
bowed
deeply
and
took
a
moment
to
glance
around
the
hall.
Lady
Arryn
had
summoned
her
knights
and
retainers
to
hear
his
confession,
as
he
had
hoped.
He
saw
Ser
Brynden
Tully’s
craggy
face
and
Lord
Nestor
Royce’s
bluff
one.
Beside
Nestor
stood
a
younger
man
with
fierce
black
side-whiskers
who
could
only
be
his
heir,
Ser
Albar.
Most
of
the
principal
houses
of
the
Vale
were
represented.
Tyrion
noted
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
slender
as
a
sword,
Lord
Hunter
with
his
gouty
legs,
the
widowed
Lady
Waynwood
surrounded
by
her
sons.
Others
sported
sigils
he
did
not
know;
broken
lance,
green
viper,
burning
tower,
winged
chalice.

Among
the
lords
of
the
Vale
were
several
of
his
companions
from
the
high
road;
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,
pale
from
half-healed
wounds,
stood
with
Ser
Willis
Wode
beside
him.
Marillion
the
singer
had
found
a
new
woodharp.
Tyrion
smiled;
whatever
happened
here
tonight,
he
did
not
wish
it
to
happen
in
secret,
and
there
was
no
one
like
a
singer
for
spreading
a
story
near
and
far.

In
the
rear
of
the
hall,
Bronn
lounged
beneath
a
pillar.
The
freerider’s
black
eyes
were
fixed
on
Tyrion,
and
his
hand
lay
lightly
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
Tyrion
gave
him
a
long
look,
wondering…

Catelyn
Stark
spoke
first.
“You
wish
to
confess
your
crimes,
we
are
told.”

“I
do,
my
lady,”
Tyrion
answered.

Lysa
Arryn
smiled
at
her
sister.
“The
sky
cells
always
break
them.
The
gods
can
see
them
there,
and
there
is
no
darkness
to
hide
in.”

“He
does
not
look
broken
to
me,”
Lady
Catelyn
said.

Lady
Lysa
paid
her
no
mind.
“Say
what
you
will,”
she
commanded
Tyrion.

And
now
to
roll
the
dice,
he
thought
with
another
quick
glance
back
at
Bronn.
“Where
to
begin?
I
am
a
vile
little
man,
I
confess
it.
My
crimes
and
sins
are
beyond
counting,
my
lords
and
ladies.
I
have
lain
with
whores,
not
once
but
hundreds
of
times.
I
have
wished
my
own
lord
father
dead,
and
my
sister,
our
gracious
queen,
as
well.”
Behind
him,
someone
chuckled.
“I
have
not
always
treated
my
servants
with
kindness.
I
have
gambled.
I
have
even
cheated,
I
blush
to
admit.
I
have
said
many
cruel
and
malicious
things
about
the
noble
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court.”
That
drew
outright
laughter.
“Once
I—”

“Silence!”
Lysa
Arryn’s
pale
round
face
had
turned
a
burning
pink.
“What
do
you
imagine
you
are
doing,
dwarf?”

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
to
one
side.
“Why,
confessing
my
crimes,
my
lady—”

Catelyn
Stark
took
a
step
forward.
“You
are
accused
of
sending
a
hired
knife
to
slay
my
son
Bran
in
his
bed,
and
of
conspiring
to
murder
Lord
Jon
Arryn,
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

Tyrion
gave
a
helpless
shrug.
“Those
crimes
I
cannot
confess,
I
fear.
I
know
nothing
of
any
murders.”

Lady
Lysa
rose
from
her
weirwood
throne.
“I
will
not
be
made
mock
of.
You
have
had
your
little
jape,
Imp.
I
trust
you
enjoyed
it.
Ser
Vardis,
take
him
back
to
the
dungeon…
but
this
time
find
him
a
smaller
cell,
with
a
floor
more
sharply
sloped.”

“Is
this
how
justice
is
done
in
the
Vale?”
Tyrion
roared,
so
loudly
that
Ser
Vardis
froze
for
an
instant.
“Does
honor
stop
at
the
Bloody
Gate?
You
accuse
me
of
crimes,
I
deny
them,
so
you
throw
me
into
an
open
cell
to
freeze
and
starve.”
He
lifted
his
head,
to
give
them
all
a
good
look
at
the
bruises
Mord
had
left
on
his
face.
“Where
is
the
king’s
justice?
Is
the
Eyrie
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms?
I
stand
accused,
you
say.
Very
well.
I
demand
a
trial!
Let
me
speak,
and
let
my
truth
or
falsehood
be
judged
openly,
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

A
low
murmuring
filled
the
High
Hall.
He
had
her,
Tyrion
knew.
He
was
highborn,
the
son
of
the
most
powerful
lord
in
the
realm,
the
brother
of
the
queen.
He
could
not
be
denied
a
trial.
Guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
had
started
toward
Tyrion,
but
Ser
Vardis
bid
them
halt
and
looked
to
Lady
Lysa.

Her
small
mouth
twitched
in
a
petulant
smile.
“If
you
are
tried
and
found
to
be
guilty
of
the
crimes
for
which
you
stand
accused,
then
by
the
king’s
own
laws,
you
must
pay
with
your
life’s
blood.
We
keep
no
headsman
in
the
Eyrie,
my
lord
of
Lannister.
Open
the
Moon
Door.”

The
press
of
spectators
parted.
A
narrow
weirwood
door
stood
between
two
slender
marble
pillars,
a
crescent
moon
carved
in
the
white
wood.
Those
standing
closest
edged
backward
as
a
pair
of
guardsmen
marched
through.
One
man
removed
the
heavy
bronze
bars;
the
second
pulled
the
door
inward.
Their
blue
cloaks
rose
snapping
from
their
shoulders,
caught
in
the
sudden
gust
of
wind
that
came
howling
through
the
open
door.
Beyond
was
the
emptiness
of
the
night
sky,
speckled
with
cold
uncaring
stars.

“Behold
the
king’s
justice,”
Lysa
Arryn
said.
Torch
flames
fluttered
like
pennons
along
the
walls,
and
here
and
there
the
odd
torch
guttered
out.

“Lysa,
I
think
this
unwise,”
Catelyn
Stark
said
as
the
black
wind
swirled
around
the
hall.

Her
sister
ignored
her.
“You
want
a
trial,
my
lord
of
Lannister.
Very
well,
a
trial
you
shall
have.
My
son
will
listen
to
whatever
you
care
to
say,
and
you
shall
hear
his
judgment.
Then
you
may
leave…
by
one
door
or
the
other.”

She
looked
so
pleased
with
herself,
Tyrion
thought,
and
small
wonder.
How
could
a
trial
threaten
her,
when
her
weakling
son
was
the
lord
judge?
Tyrion
glanced
at
her
Moon
Door.
Mother,
I
want
to
see
him
fly!
the
boy
had
said.
How
many
men
had
the
snot-nosed
little
wretch
sent
through
that
door
already?

“I
thank
you,
my
good
lady,
but
I
see
no
need
to
trouble
Lord
Robert,”
Tyrion
said
politely.
“The
gods
know
the
truth
of
my
innocence.
I
will
have
their
verdict,
not
the
judgment
of
men.
I
demand
trial
by
combat.”

A
storm
of
sudden
laughter
filled
the
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns.
Lord
Nestor
Royce
snorted,
Ser
Willis
chuckled,
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
guffawed,
and
others
threw
back
their
heads
and
howled
until
tears
ran
down
their
faces.
Marillion
clumsily
plucked
a
gay
note
on
his
new
woodharp
with
the
fingers
of
his
broken
hand.
Even
the
wind
seemed
to
whistle
with
derision
as
it
came
skirling
through
the
Moon
Door.

Lysa
Arryn’s
watery
blue
eyes
looked
uncertain.
He
had
caught
her
off
balance.
“You
have
that
right,
to
be
sure.”

The
young
knight
with
the
green
viper
embroidered
on
his
surcoat
stepped
forward
and
went
to
one
knee.
“My
lady,
I
beg
the
boon
of
championing
your
cause.”

“The
honor
should
be
mine,”
old
Lord
Hunter
said.
“For
the
love
I
bore
your
lord
husband,
let
me
avenge
his
death.”

“My
father
served
Lord
Jon
faithfully
as
High
Steward
of
the
Vale,”
Ser
Albar
Royce
boomed.
“Let
me
serve
his
son
in
this.”

“The
gods
favor
the
man
with
the
just
cause,”
said
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
“yet
often
that
turns
out
to
be
the
man
with
the
surest
sword.
We
all
know
who
that
is.”
He
smiled
modestly.

A
dozen
other
men
all
spoke
at
once,
clamoring
to
be
heard.
Tyrion
found
it
disheartening
to
realize
so
many
strangers
were
eager
to
kill
him.
Perhaps
this
had
not
been
such
a
clever
plan
after
all.

Lady
Lysa
raised
a
hand
for
silence.
“I
thank
you,
my
lords,
as
I
know
my
son
would
thank
you
if
he
were
among
us.
No
men
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
as
bold
and
true
as
the
knights
of
the
Vale.
Would
that
I
could
grant
you
all
this
honor.
Yet
I
can
choose
only
one.”
She
gestured.
“Ser
Vardis
Egen,
you
were
ever
my
lord
husband’s
good
right
hand.
You
shall
be
our
champion.”

Ser
Vardis
had
been
singularly
silent.
“My
lady,”
he
said
gravely,
sinking
to
one
knee,
“pray
give
this
burden
to
another,
I
have
no
taste
for
it.
The
man
is
no
warrior.
Look
at
him.
A
dwarf,
half
my
size
and
lame
in
the
legs.
It
would
be
shameful
to
slaughter
such
a
man
and
call
it
justice.”

Oh,
excellent,
Tyrion
thought.
“I
agree.”

Lysa
glared
at
him.
“You
demanded
a
trial
by
combat.”

“And
now
I
demand
a
champion,
such
as
you
have
chosen
for
yourself.
My
brother
Jaime
will
gladly
take
my
part,
I
know.”

“Your
precious
Kingslayer
is
hundreds
of
leagues
from
here,”
snapped
Lysa
Arryn.

“Send
a
bird
for
him.
I
will
gladly
await
his
arrival.”

“You
will
face
Ser
Vardis
on
the
morrow.”

“Singer,”
Tyrion
said,
turning
to
Marillion,
“when
you
make
a
ballad
of
this,
be
certain
you
tell
them
how
Lady
Arryn
denied
the
dwarf
the
right
to
a
champion,
and
sent
him
forth
lame
and
bruised
and
hobbling
to
face
her
finest
knight.”

“I
deny
you
nothing!”
Lysa
Arryn
said,
her
voice
peeved
and
shrill
with
irritation.
“Name
your
champion,
Imp…
if
you
think
you
can
find
a
man
to
die
for
you.”

“If
it
is
all
the
same
to
you,
I’d
sooner
find
one
to
kill
for
me.”
Tyrion
looked
over
the
long
hall.
No
one
moved.
For
a
long
moment
he
wondered
if
it
had
all
been
a
colossal
blunder.

Then
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
rear
of
the
chamber.
“I’ll
stand
for
the
dwarf,”
Bronn
called
out.





EDDARD

He
dreamt
an
old
dream,
of
three
knights
in
white
cloaks,
and
a
tower
long
fallen,
and
Lyanna
in
her
bed
of
blood.

In
the
dream
his
friends
rode
with
him,
as
they
had
in
life.
Proud
Martyn
Cassel,
Jory’s
father;
faithful
Theo
Wull;
Ethan
Glover,
who
had
been
Brandon’s
squire;
Ser
Mark
Ryswell,
soft
of
speech
and
gentle
of
heart;
the
crannogman,
Howland
Reed;
Lord
Dustin
on
his
great
red
stallion.
Ned
had
known
their
faces
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
once,
but
the
years
leech
at
a
man’s
memories,
even
those
he
has
vowed
never
to
forget.
In
the
dream
they
were
only
shadows,
grey
wraiths
on
horses
made
of
mist.

They
were
seven,
facing
three.
In
the
dream
as
it
had
been
in
life.
Yet
these
were
no
ordinary
three.
They
waited
before
the
round
tower,
the
red
mountains
of
Dorne
at
their
backs,
their
white
cloaks
blowing
in
the
wind.
And
these
were
no
shadows;
their
faces
burned
clear,
even
now.
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
had
a
sad
smile
on
his
lips.
The
hilt
of
the
greatsword
Dawn
poked
up
over
his
right
shoulder.
Ser
Oswell
Whent
was
on
one
knee,
sharpening
his
blade
with
a
whetstone.
Across
his
white-enameled
helm,
the
black
bat
of
his
House
spread
its
wings.
Between
them
stood
fierce
old
Ser
Gerold
Hightower,
the
White
Bull,
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.

“I
looked
for
you
on
the
Trident,”
Ned
said
to
them.

“We
were
not
there,”
Ser
Gerold
answered.

“Woe
to
the
Usurper
if
we
had
been,”
said
Ser
Oswell.

“When
King’s
Landing
fell,
Ser
Jaime
slew
your
king
with
a
golden
sword,
and
I
wondered
where
you
were.”

“Far
away,”
Ser
Gerold
said,
“or
Aerys
would
yet
sit
the
Iron
Throne,
and
our
false
brother
would
burn
in
seven
hells.”

“I
came
down
on
Storm’s
End
to
lift
the
siege,”
Ned
told
them,
“and
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
dipped
their
banners,
and
all
their
knights
bent
the
knee
to
pledge
us
fealty.
I
was
certain
you
would
be
among
them.”

“Our
knees
do
not
bend
easily,”
said
Ser
Arthur
Dayne.

“Ser
Willem
Darry
is
fled
to
Dragonstone,
with
your
queen
and
Prince
Viserys.
I
thought
you
might
have
sailed
with
him.”

“Ser
Willem
is
a
good
man
and
true,”
said
Ser
Oswell.

“But
not
of
the
Kingsguard,”
Ser
Gerold
pointed
out.
“The
Kingsguard
does
not
flee.”

“Then
or
now,”
said
Ser
Arthur.
He
donned
his
helm.

“We
swore
a
vow,”
explained
old
Ser
Gerold.

Ned’s
wraiths
moved
up
beside
him,
with
shadow
swords
in
hand.
They
were
seven
against
three.

“And
now
it
begins,”
said
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
He
unsheathed
Dawn
and
held
it
with
both
hands.
The
blade
was
pale
as
milkglass,
alive
with
light.

“No,”
Ned
said
with
sadness
in
his
voice.
“Now
it
ends.”
As
they
came
together
in
a
rush
of
steel
and
shadow,
he
could
hear
Lyanna
screaming.
“Eddard!”
she
called.
A
storm
of
rose
petals
blew
across
a
blood-streaked
sky,
as
blue
as
the
eyes
of
death.

“Lord
Eddard,”
Lyanna
called
again.

“I
promise,”
he
whispered.
“Lya,
I
promise…”

“Lord
Eddard,”
a
man
echoed
from
the
dark.

Groaning,
Eddard
Stark
opened
his
eyes.
Moonlight
streamed
through
the
tall
windows
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

“Lord
Eddard?”
A
shadow
stood
over
the
bed.

“How…
how
long?”
The
sheets
were
tangled,
his
leg
splinted
and
plastered.
A
dull
throb
of
pain
shot
up
his
side.

“Six
days
and
seven
nights.”
The
voice
was
Vayon
Poole’s.
The
steward
held
a
cup
to
Ned’s
lips.
“Drink,
my
lord.”

“What…?”

“Only
water.
Maester
Pycelle
said
you
would
be
thirsty.”

Ned
drank.
His
lips
were
parched
and
cracked.
The
water
tasted
sweet
as
honey.

“The
king
left
orders,”
Vayon
Poole
told
him
when
the
cup
was
empty.
“He
would
speak
with
you,
my
lord.”

“On
the
morrow,”
Ned
said.
“When
I
am
stronger.”
He
could
not
face
Robert
now.
The
dream
had
left
him
weak
as
a
kitten.

“My
lord,”
Poole
said,
“he
commanded
us
to
send
you
to
him
the
moment
you
opened
your
eyes.”
The
steward
busied
himself
lighting
a
bedside
candle.

Ned
cursed
softly.
Robert
was
never
known
for
his
patience.
“Tell
him
I’m
too
weak
to
come
to
him.
If
he
wishes
to
speak
with
me,
I
should
be
pleased
to
receive
him
here.
I
hope
you
wake
him
from
a
sound
sleep.
And
summon…”
He
was
about
to
say
Jory
when
he
remembered.
“Summon
the
captain
of
my
guard.”

Alyn
stepped
into
the
bedchamber
a
few
moments
after
the
steward
had
taken
his
leave.
“My
lord.”

“Poole
tells
me
it
has
been
six
days,”
Ned
said.
“I
must
know
how
things
stand.”

“The
Kingslayer
is
fled
the
city,”
Alyn
told
him.
“The
talk
is
he’s
ridden
back
to
Casterly
Rock
to
join
his
father.
The
story
of
how
Lady
Catelyn
took
the
Imp
is
on
every
lip.
I
have
put
on
extra
guards,
if
it
please
you.”

“It
does,”
Ned
assured
him.
“My
daughters?”

“They
have
been
with
you
every
day,
my
lord.
Sansa
prays
quietly,
but
Arya…”
He
hesitated.
“She
has
not
said
a
word
since
they
brought
you
back.
She
is
a
fierce
little
thing,
my
lord.
I
have
never
seen
such
anger
in
a
girl.”

“Whatever
happens,”
Ned
said,
“I
want
my
daughters
kept
safe.
I
fear
this
is
only
the
beginning.”

“No
harm
will
come
to
them,
Lord
Eddard,”
Alyn
said.
“I
stake
my
life
on
that.”

“Jory
and
the
others…”

“I
gave
them
over
to
the
silent
sisters,
to
be
sent
north
to
Winterfell.
Jory
would
want
to
lie
beside
his
grandfather.”

It
would
have
to
be
his
grandfather,
for
Jory’s
father
was
buried
far
to
the
south.
Martyn
Cassel
had
perished
with
the
rest.
Ned
had
pulled
the
tower
down
afterward,
and
used
its
bloody
stones
to
build
eight
cairns
upon
the
ridge.
It
was
said
that
Rhaegar
had
named
that
place
the
tower
of
joy,
but
for
Ned
it
was
a
bitter
memory.
They
had
been
seven
against
three,
yet
only
two
had
lived
to
ride
away;
Eddard
Stark
himself
and
the
little
crannogman,
Howland
Reed.
He
did
not
think
it
omened
well
that
he
should
dream
that
dream
again
after
so
many
years.

“You’ve
done
well,
Alyn,”
Ned
was
saying
when
Vayon
Poole
returned.
The
steward
bowed
low.
“His
Grace
is
without,
my
lord,
and
the
queen
with
him.”

Ned
pushed
himself
up
higher,
wincing
as
his
leg
trembled
with
pain.
He
had
not
expected
Cersei
to
come.
It
did
not
bode
well
that
she
had.
“Send
them
in,
and
leave
us.
What
we
have
to
say
should
not
go
beyond
these
walls.”
Poole
withdrew
quietly.

Robert
had
taken
time
to
dress.
He
wore
a
black
velvet
doublet
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
worked
upon
the
breast
in
golden
thread,
and
a
golden
mantle
with
a
cloak
of
black
and
gold
squares.
A
flagon
of
wine
was
in
his
hand,
his
face
already
flushed
from
drink.
Cersei
Lannister
entered
behind
him,
a
jeweled
tiara
in
her
hair.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
said.
“Your
pardons.
I
cannot
rise.”

“No
matter,”
the
king
said
gruffly.
“Some
wine?
From
the
Arbor.
A
good
vintage.”

“A
small
cup,”
Ned
said.
“My
head
is
still
heavy
from
the
milk
of
the
poppy.”

“A
man
in
your
place
should
count
himself
fortunate
that
his
head
is
still
on
his
shoulders,”
the
queen
declared.

“Quiet,
woman,”
Robert
snapped.
He
brought
Ned
a
cup
of
wine.
“Does
the
leg
still
pain
you?”

“Some,”
Ned
said.
His
head
was
swimming,
but
it
would
not
do
to
admit
to
weakness
>>>>>>> asd

the
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
horses.
Catelyn
jerked
her
reins
hard
to
avoid
him,
glancing
about
in
dismay.
Hundreds
of
smallfolk
had
been
admitted
to
the
castle,
and
allowed
to
erect
crude
shelters
against
the
walls.
Their
children
were
everywhere
underfoot,
and
the
yard
teemed
with
their
cows,
sheep,
and
chickens.
“Who
are
all
these
folk?”

“My
people,”
Edmure
answered.
“They
were
afraid.”

Only
my
sweet
brother
would
crowd
all
these
useless
mouths
into
a
castle
that
might
soon
be
under
siege.
Catelyn
knew
that
Edmure
had
a
soft
heart;
sometimes
she
thought
his
head
was
even
softer.
She
loved
him
for
it,
yet
still…

“Can
Robb
be
reached
by
raven?”

“He’s
in
the
field,
my
lady,”
Ser
Desmond
replied.
“The
bird
would
have
no
way
to
find
him.”

Utherydes
Wayn
coughed.
“Before
he
left
us,
the
young
king
instructed
us
to
send
you
on
to
the
Twins
upon
your
return,
Lady
Stark.
He
asks
that
you
learn
more
of
Lord
Walder’s
daughters,
to
help
him
select
his
bride
when
the
time
comes.”

“We’ll
provide
you
with
fresh
mounts
and
provisions,”
her
brother
promised.
“You’ll
want
to
refresh
yourself
before—”

“I’ll
want
to
stay,”
Catelyn
said,
dismounting.
She
had
no
intention
of
leaving
Riverrun
and
her
dying
father
to
pick
Robb’s
wife
for
him.
Robb
wants
me
safe,
I
cannot
fault
him
for
that,
but
his
pretext
is
growing
threadbare.
“Boy,”
she
called,
and
an
urchin
from
the
stables
ran
out
to
take
the
reins
of
her
horse.

Edmure
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
He
was
a
head
taller
than
she
was,
but
he
would
always
be
her
little
brother.
“Cat,”
he
said
unhappily,
“Lord
Tywin
is
coming—”

“He
is
making
for
the
west,
to
defend
his
own
lands.
If
we
close
our
gates
and
shelter
behind
the
walls,
we
can
watch
him
pass
with
safety.”

“This
is
Tully
land,”
Edmure
declared.
“If
Tywin
Lannister
thinks
to
cross
it
unbloodied,
I
mean
to
teach
him
a
hard
lesson.”

The
same
lesson
you
taught
his
son?
Her
brother
could
be
stubborn
as
river
rock
when
his
pride
was
touched,
but
neither
of
them
was
likely
to
forget
how
Ser
Jaime
had
cut
Edmure’s
host
to
bloody
pieces
the
last
time
he
had
offered
battle.
“We
have
nothing
to
gain
and
everything
to
lose
by
meeting
Lord
Tywin
in
the
field,”
Catelyn
said
tactfully.

“The
yard
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
my
battle
plans.”

“As
you
will.
Where
shall
we
go?”

Her
brother’s
face
darkened.
For
a
moment
she
thought
he
was
about
to
lose
his
temper
with
her,
but
finally
he
snapped,
“The
godswood.
If
you
will
insist.”

She
followed
him
along
a
gallery
to
the
godswood
gate.
Edmure’s
anger
had
always
been
a
sulky,
sullen
thing.
Catelyn
was
sorry
she
had
wounded
him,
but
the
matter
was
too
important
for
her
to
concern
herself
with
his
pride.
When
they
were
alone
beneath
the
trees,
Edmure
turned
to
face
her.

“You
do
not
have
the
strength
to
meet
the
Lannisters
in
the
field,”
she
said
bluntly.

“When
all
my
strength
is
marshaled,
I
should
have
eight
thousand
foot
and
three
thousand
horse,”
Edmure
said.

“Which
means
Lord
Tywin
will
have
near
twice
your
numbers.”

“Robb’s
won
his
battles
against
worse
odds,”
Edmure
replied,
“and
I
have
a
plan.
You’ve
forgotten
Roose
Bolton.
Lord
Tywin
defeated
him
on
the
Green
Fork,
but
failed
to
pursue.
When
Lord
Tywin
went
to
Harrenhal,
Bolton
took
the
ruby
ford
and
the
crossroads.
He
has
ten
thousand
men.
I’ve
sent
word
to
Helman
Tallhart
to
join
him
with
the
garrison
Robb
left
at
the
Twins—”

“Edmure,
Robb
left
those
men
to
hold
the
Twins
and
make
certain
Lord
Walder
keeps
faith
with
us.”

“He
has,”
Edmure
said
stubbornly.
“The
Freys
fought
bravely
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
old
Ser
Stevron
died
at
Oxcross,
we
hear.
Ser
Ryman
and
Black
Walder
and
the
rest
are
with
Robb
in
the
west,
Martyn
has
been
of
great
service
scouting,
and
Ser
Perwyn
helped
see
you
safe
to
Renly.
Gods
be
good,
how
much
more
can
we
ask
of
them?
Robb’s
betrothed
to
one
of
Lord
Walder’s
daughters,
and
Roose
Bolton
wed
another,
I
hear.
And
haven’t
you
taken
two
of
his
grandsons
to
be
fostered
at
Winterfell?”

“A
ward
can
easily
become
a
hostage,
if
need
be.”
She
had
not
known
that
Ser
Stevron
was
dead,
nor
of
Bolton’s
marriage.

“If
we’re
two
hostages
to
the
good,
all
the
more
reason
Lord
Walder
dare
not
play
us
false.
Bolton
needs
Frey’s
men,
and
Ser
Helman’s
as
well.
I’ve
commanded
him
to
retake
Harrenhal.”

“That’s
like
to
be
a
bloody
business.”

“Yes,
but
once
the
castle
falls,
Lord
Tywin
will
have
no
safe
retreat.
My
own
levies
will
defend
the
fords
of
Red
Fork
against
his
crossing.
If
he
attacks
across
the
river,
he’ll
end
as
Rhaegar
did
when
he
tried
to
cross
the
Trident.
If
he
holds
back,
he’ll
be
caught
between
Riverrun
and
Harrenhal,
and
when
Robb
returns
from
the
west
we
can
finish
him
for
good
and
all.”

Her
brother’s
voice
was
full
of
brusque
confidence,
but
Catelyn
found
herself
wishing
that
Robb
had
not
taken
her
uncle
Brynden
west
with
him.
The
Blackfish
was
the
veteran
of
half
a
hundred
battles;
Edmure
was
the
veteran
of
one,
and
that
one
lost.

“The
plan’s
a
good
one,”
he
concluded.
“Lord
Tytos
says
so,
and
Lord
Jonos
as
well.
When
did
Blackwood
and
Bracken
agree
about
anything
that
was
not
certain,
I
ask
you?”

“Be
that
as
it
may.”
She
was
suddenly
weary.
Perhaps
she
was
wrong
to
oppose
him.
Perhaps
it
was
a
splendid
plan,
and
her
misgivings
only
a
woman’s
fears.
She
wished
Ned
were
here,
or
her
uncle
Brynden,
or…“Have
you
asked
Father
about
this?”

“Father
is
in
no
state
to
weigh
strategies.
Two
days
ago
he
was
making
plans
for
your
marriage
to
Brandon
Stark!
Go
see
him
yourself
if
you
do
not
believe
me.
This
plan
will
work,
Cat,
you’ll
see.”

“I
hope
so,
Edmure.
I
truly
do.”
She
kissed
him
on
the
cheek,
to
let
him
know
she
meant
it,
and
went
to
find
her
father.

Lord
Hoster
Tully
was
much
as
she
had
left
him—abed,
haggard,
flesh
pale
and
clammy.
The
room
smelled
of
sickness,
a
cloying
odor
made
up
in
equal
parts
of
stale
sweat
and
medicine.
When
she
pulled
back
the
drapes,
her
father
gave
a
low
moan,
and
his
eyes
fluttered
open.
He
stared
at
her
as
if
he
could
not
comprehend
who
she
was
or
what
she
wanted.

“Father.”
She
kissed
him.
“I
am
returned.”

He
seemed
to
know
her
then.
“You’ve
come,”
he
whispered
faintly,
lips
barely
moving.

“Yes,”
she
said.
“Robb
sent
me
south,
but
I
hurried
back.”

“South…
where…
is
the
Eyrie
south,
sweetling?
I
don’t
recall…
oh,
dear
heart,
I
was
afraid…
have
you
forgiven
me,
child?”
Tears
ran
down
his
cheeks.

“You’ve
done
nothing
that
needs
forgiveness,
Father.”
She
stroked
his
limp
white
hair
and
felt
his
brow.
The
fever
still
burned
him
from
within,
despite
all
the
maester’s
potions.

“It
was
best,”
her
father
whispered.
“Jon’s
a
good
man,
good…
strong,
kind…
take
care
of
you…
he
will…
and
well
born,
listen
to
me,
you
must,
I’m
your
father…
your
father…
you’ll
wed
when
Cat
does,
yes
you
will…”

He
thinks
I’m
Lysa,
Catelyn
realized.
Gods
be
good,
he
talks
as
if
we
were
not
married
yet.

Her
father’s
hands
clutched
at
hers,
fluttering
like
two
frightened
white
birds.
“That
stripling…
wretched
boy…
not
speak
that
name
to
me,
your
duty…
your
mother,
she
would…”
Lord
Hoster
cried
as
a
spasm
of
pain
washed
over
him.
“Oh,
gods
forgive
me,
forgive
me,
forgive
me.
My
medicine…”

And
then
Maester
Vyman
was
there,
holding
a
cup
to
his
lips.
Lord
Hoster
sucked
at
the
thick
white
potion
as
eager
as
a
babe
at
the
breast,
and
Catelyn
could
see
peace
settle
over
him
once
more.
“He’ll
sleep
now,
my
lady,”
the
maester
said
when
the
cup
was
empty.
The
milk
of
the
poppy
had
left
a
thick
white
film
around
her
father’s
mouth.
Maester
Vyman
wiped
it
away
with
a
sleeve.

Catelyn
could
watch
no
more.
Hoster
Tully
had
been
a
strong
man,
and
proud.
It
hurt
her
to
see
him
reduced
to
this.
She
went
out
to
the
terrace.
The
yard
below
was
crowded
with
refugees
and
chaotic
with
their
noises,
but
beyond
the
walls
the
rivers
flowed
clean
and
pure
and
endless.
Those
are
his
rivers,
and
soon
he
will
return
to
them
for
his
last
voyage.

Maester
Vyman
had
followed
her
out.
“My
lady,”
he
said
softly,
“I
cannot
keep
the
end
at
bay
much
longer.
We
ought
send
a
rider
after
his
brother.
Ser
Brynden
would
wish
to
be
here.”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
said,
her
voice
thick
with
her
grief.

“And
the
Lady
Lysa
as
well,
perhaps?”

“Lysa
will
not
come.”

“If
you
wrote
her
yourself,
perhaps…”

“I
will
put
some
words
to
paper,
if
that
please
you.”
She
wondered
who
Lysa’s
“wretched
stripling”
had
been.
Some
young
squire
or
hedge
knight,
like
as
not…
though
by
the
vehemence
with
which
Lord
Hoster
had
opposed
him,
he
might
have
been
a
tradesman’s
son
or
baseborn
apprentice,
even
a
singer.
Lysa
had
always
been
too
fond
of
singers.
I
must
not
blame
her.
Jon
Arryn
was
twenty
years
older
than
our
father,
however
noble.

The
tower
her
brother
had
set
aside
for
her
use
was
the
very
same
that
she
and
Lysa
had
shared
as
maids.
It
would
feel
good
to
sleep
on
a
featherbed
again,
with
a
warm
fire
in
the
hearth;
when
she
was
rested
the
world
would
seem
less
bleak.

But
outside
her
chambers
she
found
Utherydes
Wayn
waiting
with
two
women
clad
in
grey,
their
faces
cowled
save
for
their
eyes.
Catelyn
knew
at
once
why
they
were
here.
“Ned?”

The
sisters
lowered
their
gaze.
Utherydes
said,
“Ser
Cleos
brought
him
from
King’s
Landing,
my
lady.”

“Take
me
to
him,”
she
commanded.

They
had
laid
him
out
on
a
trestle
table
and
covered
him
with
a
banner,
the
white
banner
of
House
Stark
with
its
grey
direwolf
sigil.
“I
would
look
on
him,”
Catelyn
said.

“Only
the
bones
remain,
my
lady.”

“I
would
look
on
him,”
she
repeated.

One
of
the
silent
sisters
turned
down
the
banner.

Bones,
Catelyn
thought.
This
is
not
Ned,
this
is
not
the
man
I
loved,
the
father
of
my
children.
His
hands
were
clasped
together
over
his
chest,
skeletal
fingers
curled
about
the
hilt
of
some
longsword,
but
they
were
not
Ned’s
hands,
so
strong
and
full
of
life.
They
had
dressed
the
bones
in
Ned’s
surcoat,
the
fine
white
velvet
with
the
direwolf
badge
over
the
heart,
but
nothing
remained
of
the
warm
flesh
that
had
pillowed
her
head
so
many
nights,
the
arms
that
had
held
her.
The
head
had
been
rejoined
to
the
body
with
fine
silver
wire,
but
one
skull
looks
much
like
another,
and
in
those
empty
hollows
she
found
no
trace
of
her
lord’s
dark
grey
eyes,
eyes
that
could
be
soft
as
a
fog
or
hard
as
stone.
They
gave
his
eyes
to
crows,
she
remembered.

Catelyn
turned
away.
“That
is
not
his
sword.”

“Ice
was
not
returned
to
us,
my
lady,”
Utherydes
said.
“Only
Lord
Eddard’s
bones.”

“I
suppose
I
must
thank
the
queen
for
even
that
much.”

“Thank
the
Imp,
my
lady.
It
was
his
doing.”

One
day
I
will
thank
them
all.
“I
am
grateful
for
your
service,
sisters,”
Catelyn
said,
“but
I
must
lay
another
task
upon
you.
Lord
Eddard
was
a
Stark,
and
his
bones
must
be
laid
to
rest
beneath
Winterfell.”
They
will
make
a
statue
of
him,
a
stone
likeness
that
will
sit
in
the
dark
with
a
direwolf
at
his
feet
and
a
sword
across
his
knees.
“Make
certain
the
sisters
have
fresh
horses,
and
aught
else
they
need
for
the
journey,”
she
told
Utherydes
Wayn.
“Hal
Mollen
will
escort
them
back
to
Winterfell,
it
is
his
place
as
captain
of
guards.”
She
gazed
down
at
the
bones
that
were
all
that
remained
of
her
lord
and
love.
“Now
leave
me,
all
of
you.
I
would
be
alone
with
Ned
tonight.”

The
women
in
grey
bowed
their
heads.
The
silent
sisters
do
not
speak
to
the
living,
Catelyn
remembered
dully,
but
some
say
they
can
talk
to
the
dead.
And
how
she
envied
that…





DAENERYS

The
drapes
kept
out
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
streets,
but
they
could
not
keep
out
disappointment.
Dany
climbed
inside
wearily,
glad
for
the
refuge
from
the
sea
of
Qartheen
eyes.
“Make
way,”
Jhogo
shouted
at
the
crowd
from
horseback,
snapping
his
whip,
“make
way,
make
way
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons.”

Reclining
on
cool
satin
cushions,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
poured
ruby-red
wine
into
matched
goblets
of
jade
and
gold,
his
hands
sure
and
steady
despite
the
sway
of
the
palanquin.
“I
see
a
deep
sadness
written
upon
your
face,
my
light
of
love.”
He
offered
her
a
goblet.
“Could
it
be
the
sadness
of
a
lost
dream?”

“A
dream
delayed,
no
more.”
Dany’s
tight
silver
collar
was
chafing
against
her
throat.
She
unfastened
it
and
flung
it
aside.
The
collar
was
set
with
an
enchanted
amethyst
that
Xaro
swore
would
ward
her
against
all
poisons.
The
Pureborn
were
notorious
for
offering
poisoned
wine
to
those
they
thought
dangerous,
but
they
had
not
given
Dany
so
much
as
a
cup
of
water.
They
never
saw
me
for
a
queen,
she
thought
bitterly.
I
was
only
an
afternoon’s
amusement,
a
horse
girl
with
a
curious
pet.

Rhaegal
hissed
and
dug
sharp
black
claws
into
her
bare
shoulder
as
Dany
stretched
out
a
hand
for
the
wine.
Wincing,
she
shifted
him
to
her
other
shoulder,
where
he
could
claw
her
gown
instead
of
her
skin.
She
was
garbed
after
the
Qartheen
fashion.
Xaro
had
warned
her
that
the
Enthroned
would
never
listen
to
a
Dothraki,
so
she
had
taken
care
to
go
before
them
in
flowing
green
samite
with
one
breast
bared,
silvered
sandals
on
her
feet,
with
a
belt
of
black-and-white
pearls
about
her
waist.
For
all
the
help
they
offered,
I
could
have
gone
naked.
Perhaps
I
should
have.
She
drank
deep.

Descendants
of
the
ancient
kings
and
queens
of
Qarth,
the
Pureborn
commanded
the
Civic
Guard
and
the
fleet
of
ornate
galleys
that
ruled
the
straits
between
the
seas.
Daenerys
Targaryen
had
wanted
that
fleet,
or
part
of
it,
and
some
of
their
soldiers
as
well.
She
made
the
traditional
sacrifice
in
the
Temple
of
Memory,
offered
the
traditional
bribe
to
the
Keeper
of
the
Long
List,
sent
the
traditional
persimmon
to
the
Opener
of
the
Door,
and
finally
received
the
traditional
blue
silk
slippers
summoning
her
to
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones.

The
Pureborn
heard
her
pleas
from
the
great
wooden
seats
of
their
ancestors,
rising
in
curved
tiers
from
a
marble
floor
to
a
high-domed
ceiling
painted
with
scenes
of
Qarth’s
vanished
glory.
The
chairs
were
immense,
fantastically
carved,
bright
with
goldwork
and
studded
with
amber,
onyx,
lapis,
and
jade,
each
one
different
from
all
the
others,
and
each
striving
to
be
the
most
fabulous.
Yet
the
men
who
sat
in
them
seemed
so
listless
and
world-weary
that
they
might
have
been
asleep.
They
listened,
but
they
did
not
hear,
or
care,
she
thought.
They
are
Milk
Men
indeed.
They
never
meant
to
help
me.
They
came
because
they
were
curious.
They
came
because
they
were
bored,
and
the
dragon
on
my
shoulder
interested
them
more
than
I
did.

“Tell
me
the
words
of
the
Pureborn,”
prompted
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.
“Tell
me
what
they
said
to
sadden
the
queen
of
my
heart.”

“They
said
no.”
The
wine
tasted
of
pomegranates
and
hot
summer
days.
“They
said
it
with
great
courtesy,
to
be
sure,
but
under
all
the
lovely
words,
it
was
still
no.”

“Did
you
flatter
them?”

“Shamelessly.”

“Did
you
weep?”

“The
blood
of
the
dragon
does
not
weep,”
she
said
testily.

Xaro
sighed.
“You
ought
to
have
wept.”
The
Qartheen
wept
often
and
easily;
it
was
considered
a
mark
of
the
civilized
man.
“The
men
we
bought,
what
did
they
say?”

“Mathos
said
nothing.
Wendello
praised
the
way
I
spoke.
The
Exquisite
refused
me
with
the
rest,
but
he
wept
afterward.”

“Alas,
that
Qartheen
should
be
so
faithless.”
Xaro
was
not
himself
of
the
Pureborn,
but
he
had
told
her
whom
to
bribe
and
how
much
to
offer.
“Weep,
weep,
for
the
treachery
of
men.”

Dany
would
sooner
have
wept
for
her
gold.
The
bribes
she’d
tendered
to
Mathos
Mallarawan,
Wendello
Qar
Deeth,
and
Egon
Emeros
the
Exquisite
might
have
bought
her
a
ship,
or
hired
a
score
of
sellswords.
“Suppose
I
sent
Ser
Jorah
to
demand
the
return
of
my
gifts?”
she
asked.

“Suppose
a
Sorrowful
Man
came
to
my
palace
one
night
and
killed
you
as
you
slept,”
said
Xaro.
The
Sorrowful
Men
were
an
ancient
sacred
guild
of
assassins,
so
named
because
they
always
whispered,
“I
am
so
sorry,”
to
their
victims
before
they
killed
them.
The
Qartheen
were
nothing
if
not
polite.
“It
is
wisely
said
that
it
is
easier
to
milk
the
Stone
Cow
of
Faros
than
to
wring
gold
from
the
Pureborn.”

Dany
did
not
know
where
Faros
was,
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
Qarth
was
full
of
stone
cows.
The
merchant
princes,
grown
vastly
rich
off
the
trade
between
the
seas,
were
divided
into
three
jealous
factions:
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers,
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood,
and
the
Thirteen,
to
which
Xaro
belonged.
Each
vied
with
the
others
for
dominance,
and
all
three
contended
endlessly
with
the
Pureborn.
And
brooding
over
all
were
the
warlocks,
with
their
blue
lips
and
dread
powers,
seldom
seen
but
much
feared.

She
would
have
been
lost
without
Xaro.
The
gold
that
she
had
squandered
to
open
the
doors
of
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones
was
largely
a
product
of
the
merchant’s
generosity
and
quick
wits.
As
the
rumor
of
living
dragons
had
spread
through
the
east,
ever
more
seekers
had
come
to
learn
if
the
tale
was
true—and
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
saw
to
it
that
the
great
and
the
humble
alike
offered
some
token
to
the
Mother
of
Dragons.

The
trickle
he
started
soon
swelled
to
a
flood.
Trader
captains
brought
lace
from
Myr,
chests
of
saffron
from
Yi
Ti,
amber
and
dragonglass
out
of
Asshai.
Merchants
offered
bags
of
coin,
silversmiths
rings
and
chains.
Pipers
piped
for
her,
tumblers
tumbled,
and
jugglers
juggled,
while
dyers
draped
her
in
colors
she
had
never
known
existed.
A
pair
of
Jogos
Nhai
presented
her
with
one
of
their
striped
zorses,
black
and
white
and
fierce.
A
widow
brought
the
dried
corpse
of
her
husband,
covered
with
a
crust
of
silvered
leaves;
such
remnants
were
believed
to
have
great
power,
especially
if
the
deceased
had
been
a
sorcerer,
as
this
one
had.
And
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood
pressed
on
her
a
crown
wrought
in
the
shape
of
a
three-headed
dragon;
the
coils
were
yellow
gold,
the
wings
silver,
the
heads
carved
from
jade,
ivory,
and
onyx.

The
crown
was
the
only
offering
she’d
kept.
The
rest
she
sold,
to
gather
the
wealth
she
had
wasted
on
the
Pureborn.
Xaro
would
have
sold
the
crown
too—the
Thirteen
would
see
that
she
had
a
much
finer
one,
he
swore—but
Dany
forbade
it.
“Viserys
sold
my
mother’s
crown,
and
men
called
him
a
beggar.
I
shall
keep
this
one,
so
men
will
call
me
a
queen.”
And
so
she
did,
though
the
weight
of
it
made
her
neck
ache.

Yet
even
crowned,
I
am
a
beggar
still,
Dany
thought.
I
have
become
the
most
splendid
beggar
in
the
world,
but
a
beggar
all
the
same.
She
hated
it,
as
her
brother
must
have.
All
those
years
of
running
from
city
to
city
one
step
ahead
of
the
Usurper’s
knives,
pleading
for
help
from
archons
and
princes
and
magisters,
buying
our
food
with
flattery.
He
must
have
known
how
they
mocked
him.
Small
wonder
he
turned
so
angry
and
bitter.
In
the
end
it
had
driven
him
mad.
It
will
do
the
same
to
me
if
I
let
it.
Part
of
her
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
lead
her
people
back
to
Vaes
Tolorro,
and
make
the
dead
city
bloom.
No,
that
is
defeat.
I
have
something
Viserys
never
had.
I
have
the
dragons.
The
dragons
are
all
the
difference.

She
stroked
Rhaegal.
The
green
dragon
closed
his
teeth
around
the
meat
of
her
hand
and
nipped
hard.
Outside,
the
great
city
murmured
and
thrummed
and
seethed,
all
its
myriad
voices
blending
into
one
low
sound
like
the
surge
of
the
sea.
“Make
way,
you
Milk
Men,
make
way
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons,”
Jhogo
cried,
and
the
Qartheen
moved
aside,
though
perhaps
the
oxen
had
more
to
do
with
that
than
his
voice.
Through
the
swaying
draperies,
Dany
caught
glimpses
of
him
astride
his
grey
stallion.
From
time
to
time
he
gave
one
of
the
oxen
a
flick
with
the
silver-handled
whip
she
had
given
him.
Aggo
guarded
on
her
other
side,
while
Rakharo
rode
behind
the
procession,
watching
the
faces
in
the
crowd
for
any
sign
of
danger.
Ser
Jorah
she
had
left
behind
today,
to
guard
her
other
dragons;
the
exile
knight
had
been
opposed
to
this
folly
from
the
start.
He
distrusts
everyone,
she
reflected,
and
perhaps
for
good
reason.

As
Dany
lifted
her
goblet
to
drink,
Rhaegal
sniffed
at
the
wine
and
drew
his
head
back,
hissing.
“Your
dragon
has
a
good
nose.”
Xaro
wiped
his
lips.
“The
wine
is
ordinary.
It
is
said
that
across
the
Jade
Sea
they
make
a
golden
vintage
so
fine
that
one
sip
makes
all
other
wines
taste
like
vinegar.
Let
us
take
my
pleasure
barge
and
go
in
search
of
it,
you
and
I.”

“The
Arbor
makes
the
best
wine
in
the
world,”
Dany
declared.
Lord
Redwyne
had
fought
for
her
father
against
the
Usurper,
she
remembered,
one
of
the
few
to
remain
true
to
the
last.
Will
he
fight
for
me
as
well?
There
was
no
way
to
be
certain
after
so
many
years.
“Come
with
me
to
the
Arbor,
Xaro,
and
you’ll
have
the
finest
vintages
you
ever
tasted.
But
we’ll
need
to
go
in
a
warship,
not
a
pleasure
barge.”

“I
have
no
warships.
War
is
bad
for
trade.
Many
times
I
have
told
you,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
is
a
man
of
peace.”

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
is
a
man
of
gold,
she
thought,
and
gold
will
buy
me
all
the
ships
and
swords
I
need.
“I
have
not
asked
you
to
take
up
a
sword,
only
to
lend
me
your
ships.”

He
smiled
modestly.
“Of
trading
ships
I
have
a
few,
that
is
so.
Who
can
say
how
many?
One
may
be
sinking
even
now,
in
some
stormy
corner
of
the
Summer
Sea.
On
the
morrow,
another
will
fall
afoul
of
corsairs.
The
next
day,
one
of
my
captains
may
look
at
the
wealth
in
his
hold
and
think,
All
this
should
belong
to
me.
Such
are
the
perils
of
trade.
Why,
the
longer
we
talk,
the
fewer
ships
I
am
likely
to
have.
I
grow
poorer
by
the
instant.”

“Give
me
ships,
and
I
will
make
you
rich
again.”

“Marry
me,
bright
light,
and
sail
the
ship
of
my
heart.
I
cannot
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
of
your
beauty.”

Dany
smiled.
Xaro’s
flowery
protestations
of
passion
amused
her,
but
his
manner
was
at
odds
with
his
words.
While
Ser
Jorah
had
scarcely
been
able
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
bare
breast
when
he’d
helped
her
into
the
palanquin,
Xaro
hardly
deigned
to
notice
it,
even
in
these
close
confines.
And
she
had
seen
the
beautiful
boys
who
surrounded
the
merchant
prince,
flitting
through
his
palace
halls
in
wisps
of
silk.
“You
speak
sweetly,
Xaro,
but
under
your
words
I
hear
another
no.”

“This
Iron
Throne
you
speak
of
sounds
monstrous
cold
and
hard.
I
cannot
bear
the
thought
of
jagged
barbs
cutting
your
sweet
skin.”
The
jewels
in
Xaro’s
nose
gave
him
the
aspect
of
some
strange
glittery
bird.
His
long,
elegant
fingers
waved
dismissal.
“Let
this
be
your
kingdom,
most
exquisite
of
queens,
and
let
me
be
your
king.
I
will
give
you
a
throne
of
gold,
if
you
like.
When
Qarth
begins
to
pall,
we
can
journey
round
Yi
Ti
and
search
for
the
dreaming
city
of
the
poets,
to
sip
the
wine
of
wisdom
from
a
dead
man’s
skull.”

“I
mean
to
sail
to
Westeros,
and
drink
the
wine
of
vengeance
from
the
skull
of
the
Usurper.”
She
scratched
Rhaegal
under
one
eye,
and
his
jade-green
wings
unfolded
for
a
moment,
stirring
the
still
air
in
the
palanquin.

A
single
perfect
tear
ran
down
the
cheek
of
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.
“Will
nothing
turn
you
from
this
madness?”

“Nothing,”
she
said,
wishing
she
was
as
certain
as
she
sounded.
“If
each
of
the
Thirteen
would
lend
me
ten
ships—”

“You
would
have
one
hundred
thirty
ships,
and
no
crew
to
sail
them.
The
justice
of
your
cause
means
naught
to
the
common
men
of
Qarth.
Why
should
my
sailors
care
who
sits
upon
the
throne
of
some
kingdom
at
the
edge
of
the
world?”

“I
will
pay
them
to
care.”

“With
what
coin,
sweet
star
of
my
heaven?”

“With
the
gold
the
seekers
bring.”

“That
you
may
do,”
Xaro
acknowledged,
“but
so
much
caring
will
cost
dear.
You
will
need
to
pay
them
far
more
than
I
do,
and
all
of
Qarth
laughs
at
my
ruinous
generosity.”

“If
the
Thirteen
will
not
aid
me,
perhaps
I
should
ask
the
Guild
of
Spicers
or
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood?”

Xaro
gave
a
languid
shrug.
“They
will
give
you
nothing
but
flattery
and
lies.
The
Spicers
are
dissemblers
and
braggarts
and
the
Brotherhood
is
full
of
pirates.”

“Then
I
must
heed
Pyat
Pree,
and
go
to
the
warlocks.”

The
merchant
prince
sat
up
sharply.
“Pyat
Pree
has
blue
lips,
and
it
is
truly
said
that
blue
lips
speak
only
lies.
Heed
the
wisdom
of
one
who
loves
you.
Warlocks
are
bitter
creatures
who
eat
dust
and
drink
of
shadows.
They
will
give
you
naught.
They
have
naught
to
give.”

“I
would
not
need
to
seek
sorcerous
help
if
my
friend
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
give
me
what
I
ask.”

“I
have
given
you
my
home
and
heart,
do
they
mean
nothing
to
you?
I
have
given
you
perfume
and
pomegranates,
tumbling
monkeys
and
spitting
snakes,
scrolls
from
lost
Valyria,
an
idol’s
head
and
a
serpent’s
foot.
I
have
given
you
this
palanquin
of
ebony
and
gold,
and
a
matched
set
of
bullocks
to
bear
it,
one
white
as
ivory
and
one
black
as
jet,
with
horns
inlaid
with
jewels.”

“Yes,”
Dany
said.
“But
it
was
ships
and
soldiers
I
wanted.”

“Did
I
not
give
you
an
army,
sweetest
of
women?
A
thousand
knights,
each
in
shining
armor.”

The
armor
had
been
made
of
silver
and
gold,
the
knights
of
jade
and
beryl
and
onyx
and
tourmaline,
of
amber
and
opal
and
amethyst,
each
as
tall
as
her
little
finger.
“A
thousand
lovely
knights,”
she
said,
“but
not
the
sort
my
enemies
need
fear.
And
my
bullocks
cannot
carry
me
across
the
water,
I—why
are
we
stopping?”
The
oxen
had
slowed
notably.

“Khaleesi,”
Aggo
called
through
the
drapes
as
the
palanquin
jerked
to
a
sudden
halt.
Dany
rolled
onto
an
elbow
to
lean
out.
They
were
on
the
fringes
of
the
bazaar,
the
way
ahead
blocked
by
a
solid
wall
of
people.
“What
are
they
looking
at?”

Jhogo
rode
back
to
her.
“A
firemage,
Khaleesi.”

“I
want
to
sec.”

“Then
you
must.”
The
Dothraki
offered
a
hand
down.
When
she
took
it,
he
pulled
her
up
onto
his
horse
and
sat
her
in
front
of
him,
where
she
could
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd.
The
firemage
had
conjured
a
ladder
in
the
air,
a
crackling
orange
ladder
of
swirling
flame
that
rose
unsupported
from
the
floor
of
the
bazaar,
reaching
toward
the
high
latticed
roof.

Most
of
the
spectators,
she
noticed,
were
not
of
the
city:
she
saw
sailors
off
trading
ships,
merchants
come
by
caravan,
dusty
men
out
of
the
red
waste,
wandering
soldiers,
craftsmen,
slavers.
Jhogo,
slid
one
hand
about
her
waist
and
leaned
close.
“The
Milk
Men
shun
him.
Khaleesi,
do
you
see
the
girl
in
the
felt
hat?
There,
behind
the
fat
priest.
She
is
a—”

“—cutpurse,”
finished
Dany.
She
was
no
pampered
lady,
blind
to
such
things.
She
had
seen
cutpurses
aplenty
in
the
streets
of
the
Free
Cities,
during
the
years
she’d
spent
with
her
brother,
running
from
the
Usurper’s
hired
knives.

The
mage
was
gesturing,
urging
the
flames
higher
and
higher
with
broad
sweeps
of
his
arms.
As
the
watchers
craned
their
necks
upward,
the
cutpurses
squirmed
through
the
press,
small
blades
hidden
in
their
palms.
They
relieved
the
prosperous
of
their
coin
with
one
hand
while
pointing
upward
with
the
other.

When
the
fiery
ladder
stood
forty
feet
high,
the
mage
leapt
forward
and
began
to
climb
it,
scrambling
up
hand
over
hand
as
quick
as
a
monkey.
Each
rung
he
touched
dissolved
behind
him,
leaving
no
more
than
a
wisp
of
silver
smoke.
When
he
reached
the
top,
the
ladder
was
gone
and
so
was
he.

“A
fine
trick,”
announced
Jhogo
with
admiration.

“No
trick,”
a
woman
said
in
the
Common
Tongue.

Dany
had
not
noticed
Quaithe
in
the
crowd,
yet
there
she
stood,
eyes
wet
and
shiny
behind
the
implacable
red
lacquer
mask.
“What
mean
you,
my
lady?”

“Half
a
year
gone,
that
man
could
scarcely
wake
fire
from
dragonglass.
He
had
some
small
skill
with
powders
and
wildfire,
sufficient
to
entrance
a
crowd
while
his
cutpurses
did
their
work.
He
could
walk
across
hot
coals
and
make
burning
roses
bloom
in
the
air,
but
he
could
no
more
aspire
to
climb
the
fiery
ladder
than
a
common
fisherman
could
hope
to
catch
a
kraken
in
his
nets.”

Dany
looked
uneasily
at
where
the
ladder
had
stood.
Even
the
smoke
was
gone
now,
and
the
crowd
was
breaking
up,
each
man
going
about
his
business.
In
a
moment
more
than
a
few
would
find
their
purses
flat
and
empty.
“And
now?”

“And
now
his
powers
grow,
Khaleesi.
And
you
are
the
cause
of
it.”

“Me?”
She
laughed.
“How
could
that
be?”

The
woman
stepped
closer
and
lay
two
fingers
on
Dany’s
wrist.
“You
are
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
are
you
not?”

“She
is,
and
no
spawn
of
shadows
may
touch
her.”
Jhogo
brushed
Quaithe’s
fingers
away
with
the
handle
of
his
whip.

The
woman
took
a
step
backward.
“You
must
leave
this
city
soon,
Daenerys
Targaryen,
or
you
will
never
be
permitted
to
leave
it
at
all.”

Dany’s
wrist
still
tingled
where
Quaithe
had
touched
her.
“Where
would
you
have
me
go?”
she
asked.

“To
go
north,
you
must
journey
south.
To
reach
the
west,
you
must
go
east.
To
go
forward
you
must
go
back,
and
to
touch
the
light
you
must
pass
beneath
the
shadow.”

Asshai,
Dany
thought.
She
would
have
me
go
to
Asshai.
“Will
the
Asshai’i
give
me
an
army?”
she
demanded.
“Will
there
be
gold
for
me
in
Asshai?
Will
there
be
ships?
What
is
there
in
Asshai
that
I
will
not
find
in
Qarth?”

“Truth,”
said
the
woman
in
the
mask.
And
bowing,
she
faded
back
into
the
crowd.

Rakharo
snorted
contempt
through
his
drooping
black
mustachios.
“Khaleesi,
better
a
man
should
swallow
scorpions
than
trust
in
the
spawn
of
shadows,
who
dare
not
show
their
face
beneath
the
sun.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
Aggo
agreed.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
had
watched
the
whole
exchange
from
his
cushions.
When
Dany
climbed
back
into
the
palanquin
beside
him,
he
said,
“Your
savages
are
wiser
than
they
know.
Such
truths
as
the
Asshai’i
hoard
are
not
like
to
make
you
smile.”
Then
he
pressed
another
cup
of
wine
on
her,
and
spoke
of
love
and
lust
and
other
trifles
all
the
way
back
to
his
manse.

In
the
quiet
of
her
chambers,
Dany
stripped
off
her
finery
and
donned
a
loose
robe
of
purple
silk.
Her
dragons
were
hungry,
so
she
chopped
up
a
snake
and
charred
the
pieces
over
a
brazier.
They
are
growing,
she
realized
as
she
watched
them
snap
and
squabble
over
the
blackened
flesh.
They
must
weigh
twice
what
they
had
in
Vaes
Tolorro.
Even
so,
it
would
be
years
before
they
were
large
enough
to
take
to
war.
And
they
must
be
trained
as
well,
or
they
will
lay
my
kingdom
waste.
For
all
her
Targaryen
blood,
Dany
had
not
the
least
idea
of
how
to
train
a
dragon.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
came
to
her
as
the
sun
was
going
down.
“The
Pureborn
refused
you?”

“As
you
said
they
would.
Come,
sit,
give
me
your
counsel.”
Dany
drew
him
down
to
the
cushions
beside
her,
and
Jhiqui
brought
them
a
bowl
of
purple
olives
and
onions
drowned
in
wine.

“You
will
get
no
help
in
this
city,
Khaleesi.”
Ser
Jorah
took
an
onion
between
thumb
and
forefinger.
“Each
day
I
am
more
convinced
of
that
than
the
day
before.
The
Pureborn
see
no
farther
than
the
walls
of
Qarth,
and
Xaro…”

“He
asked
me
to
marry
him
again.”

“Yes,
and
I
know
why.”
When
the
knight
frowned,
his
heavy
black
brows
joined
together
above
his
deep-set
eyes.

“He
dreams
of
me,
day
and
night.”
She
laughed.

“Forgive
me,
my
queen,
but
it
is
your
dragons
he
dreams
of.”

“Xaro
assures
me
that
in
Qarth,
man
and
woman
each
retain
their
own
property
after
they
are
wed.
The
dragons
are
mine.”
She
smiled
as
Drogon
came
hopping
and
flapping
across
the
marble
floor
to
crawl
up
on
the
cushion
beside
her.

“He
tells
it
true
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
there’s
one
thing
he
failed
to
mention.
The
Qartheen
have
a
curious
wedding
custom,
my
queen.
On
the
day
of
their
union,
a
wife
may
ask
a
token
of
love
from
her
husband.
Whatsoever
she
desires
of
his
worldly
goods,
he
must
grant.
And
he
may
ask
the
same
of
her.
One
thing
only
may
be
asked,
but
whatever
is
named
may
not
be
denied.”

“One
thing,”
she
repeated.
“And
it
may
not
be
denied?”

“With
one
dragon,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
rule
this
city,
but
one
ship
will
further
our
cause
but
little.”

Dany
nibbled
at
an
onion
and
reflected
ruefully
on
the
faithlessness
of
men.
“We
passed
through
the
bazaar
on
our
way
back
from
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones,”
she
told
Ser
Jorah.
“Quaithe
was
there.”
She
told
him
of
the
firemage
and
the
fiery
ladder,
and
what
the
woman
in
the
red
mask
had
told
her.

“I
would
be
glad
to
leave
this
city,
if
truth
be
told,”
the
knight
said
when
she
was
done.
“But
not
for
Asshai.”

“Where,
then?”

“East,”
he
said.

“I
am
half
a
world
away
from
my
kingdom
even
here.
If
I
go
any
farther
east
I
may
never
find
my
way
home
to
Westeros.”

“If
you
go
west,
you
risk
your
life.”

“House
Targaryen
has
friends
in
the
Free
Cities,”
she
reminded
him.
“Truer
friends
than
Xaro
or
the
Pureborn.”

“If
you
mean
Illyrio
Mopatis,
I
wonder.
For
sufficient
gold,
Illyrio
would
sell
you
as
quickly
as
he
would
a
slave.”

“My
brother
and
I
were
guests
in
Illyrio’s
manse
for
half
a
year.
If
he
meant
to
sell
us,
he
could
have
done
it
then.”

“He
did
sell
you,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“To
Khal
Drogo.”

Dany
flushed.
He
had
the
truth
of
it,
but
she
did
not
like
the
sharpness
with
which
he
put
it.
“Illyrio
protected
us
from
the
Usurper’s
knives,
and
he
believed
in
my
brother’s
cause.”

“Illyrio
believes
in
no
cause
but
Illyrio.
Gluttons
are
greedy
men
as
a
rule,
and
magisters
are
devious.
Illyrio
Mopatis
is
both.
What
do
you
truly
know
of
him?”

“I
know
that
he
gave
me
my
dragon
eggs.”

He
snorted.
“If
he’d
known
they
were
like
to
hatch,
he’d
would
have
sat
on
them
himself.”

That
made
her
smile
despite
herself.
“Oh,
I
have
no
doubt
of
that,
ser.
I
know
Illyrio
better
than
you
think.
I
was
a
child
when
I
left
his
manse
in
Pentos
to
wed
my
sun-and-stars,
but
I
was
neither
deaf
nor
blind.
And
I
am
no
child
now.”

“Even
if
Illyrio
is
the
friend
you
think
him,”
the
knight
said
stubbornly,
“he
is
not
powerful
enough
to
enthrone
you
by
himself,
no
more
than
he
could
your
brother.”

“He
is
rich,”
she
said.
“Not
so
rich
as
Xaro,
perhaps,
but
rich
enough
to
hire
ships
for
me,
and
men
as
well.”

“Sellswords
have
their
uses,”
Ser
Jorah
admitted,
“but
you
will
not
win
your
father’s
throne
with
sweepings
from
the
Free
Cities.
Nothing
knits
a
broken
realm
together
so
quick
as
an
invading
army
on
its
soil.”

“I
am
their
rightful
queen,”
Dany
protested.

“You
are
a
stranger
who
means
to
land
on
their
shores
with
an
army
of
outlanders
who
cannot
even
speak
the
Common
Tongue.
The
lords
of
Westeros
do
not
know
you,
and
have
every
reason
to
fear
and
mistrust
you.
You
must
win
them
over
before
you
sail.
A
few
at
least.”

“And
how
am
I
to
do
that,
if
I
go
east
as
you
counsel?”

He
ate
an
olive
and
spit
out
the
pit
into
his
palm.
“I
do
not
know,
Your
Grace,”
he
admitted,
“but
I
do
know
that
the
longer
you
remain
in
one
place,
the
easier
it
will
be
for
your
enemies
to
find
you.
The
name
Targaryen
still
frightens
them,
so
much
so
that
they
sent
a
man
to
murder
you
when
they
heard
you
were
with
child.
What
will
they
do
when
they
learn
of
your
dragons?”

Drogon
was
curled
up
beneath
her
arm,
as
hot
as
a
stone
that
has
soaked
all
day
in
the
blazing
sun.
Rhaegal
and
Viserion
were
fighting
over
a
scrap
of
meat,
buffeting
each
other
with
their
wings
as
smoke
hissed
from
their
nostrils.
My
furious
children,
she
thought.
They
must
not
come
to
harm.
“The
comet
led
me
to
Qarth
for
a
reason.
I
had
hoped
to
find
my
army
here,
but
it
seems
that
will
not
be.
What
else
remains,
I
ask
myself?”
I
am
afraid,
she
realized,
but
I
must
be
brave.
“Come
the
morrow,
you
must
go
to
Pyat
Pree.”





TYRION

The
girl
never
wept.
Young
as
she
was,
Myrcella
Baratheon
was
a
princess
born.
And
a
Lannister,
despite
her
name,
Tyrion
reminded
himself,
as
much
Jaime’s
blood
as
Cersei’s.

To
be
sure,
her
smile
was
a
shade
tremulous
when
her
brothers
took
their
leave
of
her
on
the
deck
of
the
Seaswift,
but
the
girl
knew
the
proper
words
to
say,
and
she
said
them
with
courage
and
dignity.
When
the
time
came
to
part,
it
was
Prince
Tommen
who
cried,
and
Myrcella
who
gave
him
comfort.

Tyrion
looked
down
upon
the
farewells
from
the
high
deck
of
King
Robert’s
Hammer,
a
great
war
galley
of
four
hundred
oars.
Rob’s
Hammer,
as
her
oarsmen
called
her,
would
form
the
main
strength
of
Myrcella’s
escort.
Lionstar,
Bold
Wind,
and
Lady
Lyanna
would
sail
with
her
as
well.

It
made
Tyrion
more
than
a
little
uneasy
to
detach
so
great
a
part
of
their
already
inadequate
fleet,
depleted
as
it
was
by
the
loss
of
all
those
ships
that
had
sailed
with
Lord
Stannis
to
Dragonstone
and
never
returned,
but
Cersei
would
hear
of
nothing
less.
Perhaps
she
was
wise.
If
the
girl
was
captured
before
she
reached
Sunspear,
the
Dornish
alliance
would
fall
to
pieces.
So
far
Doran
Martell
had
done
no
more
than
call
his
banners.
Once
Myrcella
was
safe
in
Braavos,
he
had
pledged
to
move
his
strength
to
the
high
passes,
where
the
threat
might
make
some
of
the
Marcher
lords
rethink
their
loyalties
and
give
Stannis
pause
about
marching
north.
It
was
purely
a
feint,
however.
The
Martells
would
not
commit
to
actual
battle
unless
Dorne
itself
was
attacked,
and
Stannis
was
not
so
great
a
fool.
Though
some
of
his
bannermen
may
be,
Tyrion
reflected.
I
should
think
on
that.

He
cleared
his
throat.
“You
know
your
orders,
Captain.”

“I
do,
my
lord.
We
are
to
follow
the
coast,
staying
always
in
sight
of
land,
until
we
reach
Crackclaw
Point.
From
there
we
are
to
strike
out
across
the
narrow
sea
for
Braavos.
On
no
account
are
we
to
sail
within
sight
of
Dragonstone.”

“And
if
our
foes
should
chance
upon
you
nonetheless?”

“If
a
single
ship,
we
are
to
run
them
off
or
destroy
them.
If
there
are
more,
the
Bold
Wind
will
cleave
to
the
Seaswift
to
protect
her
while
the
rest
of
the
fleet
does
battle.”

Tyrion
nodded.
If
the
worst
happened,
the
little
Seaswift
ought
to
be
able
to
outrun
pursuit.
A
small
ship
with
big
sails,
she
was
faster
than
any
warship
afloat,
or
so
her
captain
had
claimed.
Once
Myrcella
reached
Braavos,
she
ought
to
be
safe.
He
was
sending
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
as
her
sworn
shield,
and
had
engaged
the
Braavosi
to
bring
her
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Sunspear.
Even
Lord
Stannis
would
hesitate
to
wake
the
anger
of
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
of
the
Free
Cities.
Traveling
from
King’s
Landing
to
Dorne
by
way
of
Braavos
was
scarcely
the
most
direct
of
routes,
but
it
was
the
safest…
or
so
he
hoped.

If
Lord
Stannis
knew
of
this
sailing,
he
could
not
choose
a
better
time
to
send
his
fleet
against
us.
Tyrion
glanced
back
to
where
the
Rush
emptied
out
into
Blackwater
Bay
and
was
relieved
to
see
no
signs
of
sails
on
the
wide
green
horizon.
At
last
report,
the
Baratheon
fleet
still
lay
off
Storm’s
End,
where
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
continued
to
defy
the
besiegers
in
dead
Renly’s
name.
Meanwhile,
Tyrion’s
winch
towers
stood
three-quarters
complete.
Even
now
men
were
hoisting
heavy
blocks
of
stone
into
place,
no
doubt
cursing
him
for
making
them
work
through
the
festivities.
Let
them
curse.
Another
fortnight,
Stannis,
that’s
all
I
require.
Another
fortnight
and
it
will
be
done.

Tyrion
watched
his
niece
kneel
before
the
High
Septon
to
receive
his
blessing
on
her
voyage.
Sunlight
caught
in
his
crystal
crown
and
spilled
rainbows
across
Myrcella’s
upturned
face.
The
noise
from
the
riverside
made
it
impossible
to
hear
the
prayers.
He
hoped
the
gods
had
sharper
ears.
The
High
Septon
was
as
fat
as
a
house,
and
more
pompous
and
long
of
wind
than
even
Pycelle.
Enough,
old
man,
make
an
end
to
it,
Tyrion
thought
irritably.
The
gods
have
better
things
to
do
than
listen
to
you,
and
so
do
I.

When
at
last
the
droning
and
mumbling
was
done,
Tyrion
took
his
farewell
of
the
captain
of
Rob’s
Hammer.
“Deliver
my
niece
safely
to
Braavos,
and
there
will
be
a
knighthood
waiting
for
you
on
your
return,”
he
promised.

As
he
made
his
way
down
the
steep
plank
to
the
quay,
Tyrion
could
feel
unkind
eyes
upon
him.
The
galley
rocked
gently
and
the
movement
underfoot
made
his
waddle
worse
than
ever.
I’ll
wager
they’d
love
to
snigger.
No
one
dared,
not
openly,
though
he
heard
mutterings
mingled
with
the
creak
of
wood
and
rope
and
the
rush
of
the
river
around
the
pilings.
They
do
not
love
me,
he
thought.
Well,
small
wonder.
I’m
well
fed
and
ugly,
and
they
are
starving.

Bronn
escorted
him
through
the
crowd
to
join
his
sister
and
her
sons.
Cersei
ignored
him,
preferring
to
lavish
her
smiles
on
their
cousin.
He
watched
her
charming
Lancel
with
eyes
as
green
as
the
rope
of
emeralds
around
her
slim
white
throat,
and
smiled
a
small
sly
smile
to
himself.
I
know
your
secret,
Cersei,
he
thought.
His
sister
had
oft
called
upon
the
High
Septon
of
late,
to
seek
the
blessings
of
the
gods
in
their
coming
struggle
with
Lord
Stannis…
or
so
she
would
have
him
believe.
In
truth,
after
a
brief
call
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
Cersei
would
don
a
plain
brown
traveler’s
cloak
and
steal
off
to
meet
a
certain
hedge
knight
with
the
unlikely
name
of
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack,
and
his
equally
unsavory
brothers
Osney
and
Osfryd.
Lancel
had
told
him
all
about
them.
Cersei
meant
to
use
the
Kettleblacks
to
buy
her
own
force
of
sellswords.

Well,
let
her
enjoy
her
plots.
She
was
much
sweeter
when
she
thought
she
was
outwitting
him.
The
Kettleblacks
would
charm
her,
take
her
coin,
and
promise
her
anything
she
asked,
and
why
not,
when
Bronn
was
matching
every
copper
penny,
coin
for
coin?
Amiable
rogues
all
three,
the
brothers
were
in
truth
much
more
skilled
at
deceit
than
they’d
ever
been
at
bloodletting.
Cersei
had
managed
to
buy
herself
three
hollow
drums;
they
would
make
all
the
fierce
booming
sounds
she
required,
but
there
was
nothing
inside.
It
amused
Tyrion
no
end.

Horns
blew
fanfares
as
Lionstar
and
Lady
Lyanna
pushed
out
from
shore,
moving
downriver
to
clear
the
way
for
Seaswift.
A
few
cheers
went
up
from
the
crush
along
the
banks,
as
thin
and
ragged
as
the
clouds
scuttling
overhead.
Myrcella
smiled
and
waved
from
the
deck.
Behind
her
stood
Arys
Oakheart,
his
white
cloak
streaming.
The
captain
ordered
lines
cast
off,
and
oars
pushed
the
Seaswift
out
into
the
lusty
current
of
the
Blackwater
Rush,
where
her
sails
blossomed
in
the
wind—common
white
sails,
as
Tyrion
had
insisted,
not
sheets
of
Lannister
crimson.
Prince
Tommen
sobbed.
“You
mew
like
a
suckling
babe,”
his
brother
hissed
at
him.
“Princes
aren’t
supposed
to
cry.”

“Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
cried
the
day
Princess
Naerys
wed
his
brother
Aegon,”
Sansa
Stark
said,
“and
the
twins
Ser
Arryk
and
Ser
Erryk
died
with
tears
on
their
cheeks
after
each
had
given
the
other
a
mortal
wound.”

“Be
quiet,
or
I’ll
have
Ser
Meryn
give
you
a
mortal
wound,”
Joffrey
told
his
betrothed.
Tyrion
glanced
at
his
sister,
but
Cersei
was
engrossed
in
something
Ser
Balon
Swann
was
telling
her.
Can
she
truly
be
so
blind
as
to
what
he
is?
he
wondered.

Out
on
the
river,
Bold
Wind
unshipped
her
oars
and
glided
downstream
in
the
wake
of
Seaswift.
Last
came
King
Robert’s
Hammer,
the
might
of
the
royal
fleet…
or
at
least
that
portion
that
had
not
fled
to
Dragonstone
last
year
with
Stannis.
Tyrion
had
chosen
the
ships
with
care,
avoiding
any
whose
captains
might
be
of
doubtful
loyalty,
according
to
Varys…
but
as
Varys
himself
was
of
doubtful
loyalty,
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
remained.
I
rely
too
much
on
Varys,
he
reflected.
I
need
my
own
informers.
Not
that
I’d
trust
them
either.
Trust
would
get
you
killed.

He
wondered
again
about
Littlefinger.
There
had
been
no
word
from
Petyr
Baelish
since
he
had
ridden
off
for
Bitterbridge.
That
might
mean
nothing—or
everything.
Even
Varys
could
not
say.
The
eunuch
had
suggested
that
perhaps
Littlefinger
had
met
some
misfortune
on
the
roads.
He
might
even
be
slain.
Tyrion
had
snorted
in
derision.
“If
Littlefinger
is
dead,
then
I’m
a
giant.”
More
likely,
the
Tyrells
were
balking
at
the
proposed
marriage.
Tyrion
could
scarcely
blame
them.
If
I
were
Mace
Tyrell,
I
would
sooner
have
Joffrey’s
head
on
a
pike
than
his
cock
in
my
daughter.

The
little
fleet
was
well
out
into
the
bay
when
Cersei
indicated
that
it
was
time
to
go.
Bronn
brought
Tyrion’s
horse
and
helped
him
mount.
That
was
Podrick
Payne’s
task,
but
they
had
left
Pod
back
at
the
Red
Keep.
The
gaunt
sellsword
made
for
a
much
more
reassuring
presence
than
the
boy
would
have.

The
narrow
streets
were
lined
by
men
of
the
City
Watch,
holding
back
the
crowd
with
the
shafts
of
their
spears.
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
went
in
front,
heading
a
wedge
of
mounted
lancers
in
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks.
Behind
him
came
Ser
Aron
Santagar
and
Ser
Balon
Swann,
bearing
the
king’s
banners,
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon.

King
Joffrey
followed
on
a
tall
grey
palfrey,
a
golden
crown
set
upon
his
golden
curls.
Sansa
Stark
rode
a
chesnut
mare
at
his
side,
looking
neither
right
nor
left,
her
thick
auburn
hair
flowing
to
her
shoulders
beneath
a
net
of
moonstones.
Two
of
the
Kingsguard
flanked
the
couple,
the
Hound
on
the
king’s
right
hand
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
to
the
left
of
the
Stark
girl.

Next
came
Tommen,
snuffling,
with
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
in
his
white
armor
and
cloak,
and
then
Cersei,
accompanied
by
Ser
Lancel
and
protected
by
Meryn
Trant
and
Boros
Blount.
Tyrion
fell
in
with
his
sister.
After
them
followed
the
High
Septon
in
his
litter,
and
a
long
tail
of
other
courtiers—Ser
Horas
Redwyne,
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughter,
Jalabhar
Xho,
Lord
Gyles
Rosby,
and
the
rest.
A
double
column
of
guardsmen
brought
up
the
rear.

The
unshaven
and
the
unwashed
stared
at
the
riders
with
dull
resentment
from
behind
the
line
of
spears.
I
like
this
not
one
speck,
Tyrion
thought.
Bronn
had
a
score
of
sellswords
scattered
through
the
crowd
with
orders
to
stop
any
trouble
before
it
started.
Perhaps
Cersei
had
similarly
disposed
her
Kettleblacks.
Somehow
Tyrion
did
not
think
it
would
help
much.
If
the
fire
was
too
hot,
you
could
hardly
keep
the
pudding
from
scorching
by
tossing
a
handful
of
raisins
in
the
pot.

They
crossed
Fishmonger’s
Square
and
rode
along
Muddy
Way
before
turning
onto
the
narrow,
curving
Hook
to
begin
their
climb
up
Aegon’s
High
Hill.
A
few
voices
raised
a
cry
of
“Joffrey!
All
hail,
all
hail!”
as
the
young
king
rode
by,
but
for
every
man
who
picked
up
the
shout,
a
hundred
kept
their
silence.
The
Lannisters
moved
through
a
sea
of
ragged
men
and
hungry
women,
breasting
a
tide
of
sullen
eyes.
Just
ahead
of
him,
Cersei
was
laughing
at
something
Lancel
had
said,
though
he
suspected
her
merriment
was
feigned.
She
could
not
be
oblivious
to
the
unrest
around
them,
but
his
sister
always
believed
in
putting
on
the
brave
show.

Halfway
along
the
route,
a
wailing
woman
forced
her
way
between
two
watchmen
and
ran
out
into
the
street
in
front
of
the
king
and
his
companions,
holding
the
corpse
of
her
dead
baby
above
her
head.
It
was
blue
and
swollen,
grotesque,
but
the
real
horror
was
the
mother’s
eyes.
Joffrey
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
he
meant
to
ride
her
down,
but
Sansa
Stark
leaned
over
and
said
something
to
him.
The
king
fumbled
in
his
purse,
and
flung
the
woman
a
silver
stag.
The
coin
bounced
off
the
child
and
rolled
away,
under
the
legs
of
the
gold
cloaks
and
into
the
crowd,
where
a
dozen
men
began
to
fight
for
it.
The
mother
never
once
blinked.
Her
skinny
arms
were
trembling
from
the
dead
weight
of
her
son.

“Leave
her,
Your
Grace,”
Cersei
called
out
to
the
king,
“she’s
beyond
our
help,
poor
thing.”

The
mother
heard
her.
Somehow
the
queen’s
voice
cut
through
the
woman’s
ravaged
wits.
Her
slack
face
twisted
in
loathing.
“Whore!”
she
shrieked.
“Kingslayer’s
whore!
Brotherfucker!”
Her
dead
child
dropped
from
her
arms
like
a
sack
of
flour
as
she
pointed
at
Cersei.
“Brotherfucker
brotherfucker
brotherfucker.”

Tyrion
never
saw
who
threw
the
dung.
He
only
heard
Sansa’s
gasp
and
Joffrey’s
bellowed
curse,
and
when
he
turned
his
head,
the
king
was
wiping
brown
filth
from
his
cheek.
There
was
more
caked
in
his
golden
hair
and
spattered
over
Sansa’s
legs.

“Who
threw
that?”
Joffrey
screamed.
He
pushed
his
fingers
into
his
hair,
made
a
furious
face,
and
flung
away
another
handful
of
dung.
“I
want
the
man
who
threw
that!”
he
shouted.
“A
hundred
golden
dragons
to
the
man
who
gives
him
up.”

“He
was
up
there!”
someone
shouted
from
the
crowd.
The
king
wheeled
his
horse
in
a
circle
to
survey
the
rooftops
and
open
balconies
above
them.
In
the
crowd
people
were
pointing,
shoving,
cursing
one
another
and
the
king.

“Please,
Your
Grace,
let
him
go,”
Sansa
pleaded.

The
king
paid
her
no
heed.
“Bring
me
the
man
who
flung
that
filth!”
Joffrey
commanded.
“He’ll
lick
it
off
me
or
I’ll
have
his
head.
Dog,
you
bring
him
here!”

Obedient,
Sandor
Clegane
swung
down
from
his
saddle,
but
there
was
no
way
through
that
wall
of
flesh,
let
alone
to
the
roof.
Those
closest
to
him
began
to
squirm
and
shove
to
get
away,
while
others
pushed
forward
to
see.
Tyrion
smelled
disaster.
“Clegane,
leave
off,
the
man
is
long
fled.”

“I
want
him!”
Joffrey
pointed
at
the
roof.
“He
was
up
there!
Dog,
cut
through
them
and
bring—”

A
tumult
of
sound
drowned
his
last
words,
a
rolling
thunder
of
rage
and
fear
and
hatred
that
engulfed
them
from
all
sides.
“Bastard!”
someone
screamed
at
Joffrey,
“bastard
monster.”
Other
voices
flung
calls
of
“Whore”
and
“Brotherfucker”
at
the
queen,
while
Tyrion
was
pelted
with
shouts
of
“Freak”
and
“Halfman.”
Mixed
in
with
the
abuse,
he
heard
a
few
cries
of
“Justice”
and
“Robb,
King
Robb,
the
Young
Wolf,”
of
“Stannis!”
and
even
“Renly!”
From
both
sides
of
the
street,
the
crowd
surged
against
the
spear
shafts
while
the
gold
cloaks
struggled
to
hold
the
line.
Stones
and
dung
and
fouler
things
whistled
overhead.
“Feed
us!”
a
woman
shrieked.
“Bread!”
boomed
a
man
behind
her.
“We
want
bread,
bastard!”
In
a
heartbeat,
a
thousand
voices
took
up
the
chant.
King
Joffrey
and
King
Robb
and
King
Stannis
were
forgotten,
and
King
Bread
ruled
alone.
“Bread,”
they
clamored.
“Bread,
bread!”

Tyrion
spurred
to
his
sister’s
side,
yelling,
“Back
to
the
castle.
Now.”
Cersei
gave
a
curt
nod,
and
Ser
Lancel
unsheathed
his
sword.
Ahead
of
the
column,
Jacelyn
Bywater
was
roaring
commands.
His
riders
lowered
their
lances
and
drove
forward
in
a
wedge.
The
king
was
wheeling
his
palfrey
around
in
anxious
circles
while
hands
reached
past
the
line
of
gold
cloaks,
grasping
for
him.
One
managed
to
get
hold
of
his
leg,
but
only
for
an
instant.
Ser
Mandon’s
sword
slashed
down,
parting
hand
from
wrist.
“Ride!”
Tyrion
shouted
at
his
nephew,
giving
the
horse
a
sharp
smack
on
the
rump.
The
animal
reared,
trumpeting,
and
plunged
ahead,
the
press
shattering
before
him.

Tyrion
drove
into
the
gap
hard
on
the
king’s
hooves.
Bronn
kept
pace,
sword
in
hand.
A
jagged
rock
flew
past
his
head
as
he
rode,
and
a
rotten
cabbage
exploded
against
Ser
Mandon’s
shield.
To
their
left,
three
gold
cloaks
went
down
under
the
surge,
and
then
the
crowd
was
rushing
forward,
trampling
the
fallen
men.
The
Hound
had
vanished
behind,
though
his
riderless
horse
galloped
beside
them.
Tyrion
saw
Aron
Santagar
pulled
from
the
saddle,
the
gold-and-black
Baratheon
stag
torn
from
his
grasp.
Ser
Balon
Swann
dropped
the
Lannister
lion
to
draw
his
longsword.
He
slashed
right
and
left
as
the
fallen
banner
was
ripped
apart,
the
thousand
ragged
pieces
swirling
away
like
crimson
leaves
in
a
stormwind.
In
an
instant
they
were
gone.
Someone
staggered
in
front
of
Joffrey’s
horse
and
shrieked
as
the
king
rode
him
down.
Whether
it
had
been
man,
woman,
or
child
Tyrion
could
not
have
said.
Joffrey
was
galloping
at
his
side,
whey-faced,
with
Ser
Mandon
Moore
a
white
shadow
on
his
left.

And
suddenly
the
madness
was
behind
and
they
were
clattering
across
the
cobbled
square
that
fronted
on
the
castle
barbican.
A
line
of
spearmen
held
the
gates.
Ser
Jacelyn
was
wheeling
his
lances
around
for
another
charge.
The
spears
parted
to
let
the
king’s
party
pass
under
the
portcullis.
Pale
red
walls
loomed
up
about
them,
reassuringly
high
and
aswarm
with
crossbowmen.

Tyrion
did
not
recall
dismounting.
Ser
Mandon
was
helping
the
shaken
king
off
his
horse
when
Cersei,
Tommen,
and
Lancel
rode
through
the
gates
with
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Boros
close
behind.
Boros
had
blood
smeared
along
his
blade,
while
Meryn’s
white
cloak
had
been
torn
from
his
back.
Ser
Balon
Swann
rode
in
helmetless,
his
mount
lathered
and
bleeding
at
the
mouth.
Horas
Redwyne
brought
in
Lady
Tanda,
half
crazed
with
fear
for
her
daughter
Lollys,
who
had
been
knocked
from
the
saddle
and
left
behind.
Lord
Gyles,
more
grey
of
face
than
ever,
stammered
out
a
tale
of
seeing
the
High
Septon
spilled
from
his
litter,
screeching
prayers
as
the
crowd
swept
over
him.
Jalabhar
Xho
said
he
thought
he’d
seen
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
of
the
Kingsguard
riding
back
toward
the
High
Septon’s
overturned
litter,
but
he
was
not
certain.

Tyrion
was
dimly
aware
of
a
maester
asking
if
he
was
injured.
He
pushed
his
way
across
the
yard
to
where
his
nephew
stood,
his
dung-encrusted
crown
askew.
“Traitors,”
Joffrey
was
babbling
excitedly,
“I’ll
have
all
their
heads,
I’ll—”

The
dwarf
slapped
his
flushed
face
so
hard
the
crown
flew
from
Joffrey’s
head.
Then
he
shoved
him
with
both
hands
and
knocked
him
sprawling.
“You
blind
bloody
fool.”

“They
were
traitors,”
Joffrey
squealed
from
the
ground.
“They
called
me
names
and
attacked
me!”

“You
set
your
dog
on
them!
What
did
you
imagine
they
would
do,
bend
the
knee
meekly
while
the
Hound
lopped
off
some
limbs?
You
spoiled
witless
little
boy,
you’ve
killed
Clegane
and
gods
know
how
many
more,
and
yet
you
come
through
unscratched.
Damn
you!”
And
he
kicked
him.
It
felt
so
good
he
might
have
done
more,
but
Ser
Mandon
Moore
pulled
him
off
as
Joffrey
howled,
and
then
Bronn
was
there
to
take
him
in
hand.
Cersei
knelt
over
her
son,
while
Ser
Balon
Swann
restrained
Ser
Lancel.
Tyrion
wrenched
free
of
Bronn’s
grip.
“How
many
are
still
out
there?”
he
shouted
to
no
one
and
everyone.

“My
daughter,”
cried
Lady
Tanda.
“Please,
someone
must
go
back
for
Lollys…”

“Ser
Preston
is
not
returned,”
Ser
Boros
Blount
reported,
“nor
Aron
Santagar.”

“Nor
Wet
Nurse,”
said
Ser
Horas
Redwyne.
That
was
the
mocking
name
the
other
squires
had
hung
on
young
Tyrek
Lannister.

Tyrion
glanced
round
the
yard.
“Where’s
the
Stark
girl?”

For
a
moment
no
one
answered.
Finally
Joffrey
said,
“She
was
riding
by
me.
I
don’t
know
where
she
went.”

Tyrion
pressed
blunt
fingers
into
his
throbbing
temples.
If
Sansa
Stark
had
come
to
harm,
Jaime
was
as
good
as
dead.
“Ser
Mandon,
you
were
her
shield.”

Ser
Mandon
Moore
remained
untroubled.
“When
they
mobbed
the
Hound,
I
thought
first
of
the
king.”

“And
rightly
so,”
Cersei
put
in.
“Boros,
Meryn,
go
back
and
find
the
girl.”

“And
my
daughter,”
Lady
Tanda
sobbed.
“Please,
sers…”

Ser
Boros
did
not
look
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
safety
of
the
castle.
“Your
Grace,”
he
told
the
queen,
“the
sight
of
our
white
cloaks
might
enrage
the
mob.”

Tyrion
had
stomached
all
he
cared
to.
“The
Others
take
your
fucking
cloaks!
Take
them
off
if
you’re
afraid
to
wear
them,
you
bloody
oaf…
but
find
me
Sansa
Stark
or
I
swear,
I’ll
have
Shagga
split
that
ugly
head
of
yours
in
two
to
see
if
there’s
anything
inside
but
black
pudding.”

Ser
Boros
went
purple
with
rage.
“You
would
call
me
ugly,
you?”
He
started
to
raise
the
bloody
sword
still
clutched
in
his
mailed
fist.
Bronn
shoved
Tyrion
unceremoniously
behind
him.

“Stop
it!”
Cersei
snapped.
“Boros,
you’ll
do
as
you’re
bid,
or
we’ll
find
someone
else
to
wear
that
cloak.
Your
oath—”

“There
she
is!”
Joffrey
shouted,
pointing.

Sandor
Clegane
cantered
briskly
through
the
gates
astride
Sansa’s
chestnut
courser.
The
girl
was
seated
behind,
both
arms
tight
around
the
Hound’s
chest.

Tyrion
called
to
her.
“Are
you
hurt,
Lady
Sansa?”

Blood
was
trickling
down
Sansa’s
brow
from
a
deep
gash
on
her
scalp.
“They…
they
were
throwing
things…
rocks
and
filth,
eggs…
I
tried
to
tell
them,
I
had
no
bread
to
give
them.
A
man
tried
to
pull
me
from
the
saddle.
The
Hound
killed
him,
I
think…
his
arm…”
Her
eyes
widened
and
she
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth.
“He
cut
off
his
arm.”

Clegane
lifted
her
to
the
ground.
His
white
cloak
was
torn
and
stained,
and
blood
seeped
through
a
jagged
tear
in
his
left
sleeve.
“The
little
bird’s
bleeding.
Someone
take
her
back
to
her
cage
and
see
to
that
cut.”
Maester
Frenken
scurried
forward
to
obey.
“They
did
for
Santagar,”
the
Hound
continued.
“Four
men
held
him
down
and
took
turns
bashing
at
his
head
with
a
cobblestone.
I
gutted
one,
not
that
it
did
Ser
Aron
much
good.”

Lady
Tanda
approached
him.
“My
daughter—”

“Never
saw
her.”
The
Hound
glanced
around
the
yard,
scowling.
“Where’s
my
horse?
If
anything’s
happened
to
that
horse,
someone’s
going
to
pay.”

“He
was
running
with
us
for
a
time,”
Tyrion
said,
“but
I
don’t
know
what
became
of
him
after
that.”

“Fire!”
a
voice
screamed
down
from
atop
the
barbican.
“My
lords,
there’s
smoke
in
the
city.
Flea
Bottom’s
afire.”

Tyrion
was
inutterably
weary,
but
there
was
no
time
for
despair.
“Bronn,
take
as
many
men
as
you
need
and
see
that
the
water
wagons
are
not
molested,”
Gods
be
good,
the
wildfire,
if
any
blaze
should
reach
that…“We
can
lose
all
of
Flea
Bottom
if
we
must,
but
on
no
account
must
the
fire
reach
the
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists,
is
that
understood?
Clegane,
you’ll
go
with
him.”

For
half
a
heartbeat,
Tyrion
thought
he
glimpsed
fear
in
the
Hound’s
dark
eyes.
Fire,
he
realized.
The
Others
take
me,
of
course
he
hates
flre,
he’s
tasted
it
too
well.
The
look
was
gone
in
an
instant,
replaced
by
Clegane’s
familiar
scowl.
“I’ll
go,”
he
said,
“though
not
by
your
command.
I
need
to
find
that
horse.”

Tyrion
turned
to
the
three
remaining
knights
of
the
Kingsguard.
“Each
of
you
will
ride
escort
to
a
herald.
Command
the
people
to
return
to
their
homes.
Any
man
found
on
the
streets
after
the
last
peal
of
the
evenfall
bell
will
be
killed.”

“Our
place
is
beside
the
king,”
Ser
Meryn
said,
complacent.

Cersei
reared
up
like
a
viper.
“Your
place
is
where
my
brother
says
it
is,”
she
spit.
“The
Hand
speaks
with
the
king’s
own
voice,
and
disobedience
is
treason.”

Boros
and
Meryn
exchanged
a
look.
“Should
we
wear
our
cloaks,
Your
Grace?”
Ser
Boros
asked.

“Go
naked
for
all
I
care.
It
might
remind
the
mob
that
you’re
men.
They’re
like
to
have
forgotten
after
seeing
the
way
you
behaved
out
there
in
the
street.”

Tyrion
let
his
sister
rage.
His
head
was
throbbing.
He
thought
he
could
smell
smoke,
though
perhaps
it
was
just
the
scent
of
his
nerves
fraying.

Two
of
the
Stone
Crows
guarded
the
door
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“Find
me
Timett
son
of
Timett.”

“Stone
Crows
do
not
run
squeaking
after
Burned
Men,”
one
of
the
wildlings
informed
him
haughtily.

For
a
moment
Tyrion
had
forgotten
who
he
was
dealing
with.
“Then
find
me
Shagga.”

“Shagga
sleeps.”

It
was
an
effort
not
to
scream.
“Wake.
Him.”

“It
is
no
easy
thing
to
wake
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,”
the
man
complained.
“His
wrath
is
fearsome.”
He
went
off
grumbling.

The
clansman
wandered
in
yawning
and
scratching.
“Half
the
city
is
rioting,
the
other
half
is
burning,
and
Shagga
lies
snoring,”
Tyrion
said.

“Shagga
mislikes
your
muddy
water
here,
so
he
must
drink
your
weak
ale
and
sour
wine,
and
after
his
head
hurts.”

“I
have
Shae
in
a
manse
near
the
Iron
Gate.
I
want
you
to
go
to
her
and
keep
her
safe,
whatever
may
come.”

The
huge
man
smiled,
his
teeth
a
yellow
crevasse
in
the
hairy
wilderness
of
his
beard.
“Shagga
will
fetch
her
here.”

“Just
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
her.
Tell
her
I
will
come
to
her
as
soon
as
I
may.
This
very
night,
perhaps,
or
on
the
morrow
for
a
certainty.”

Yet
by
evenfall
the
city
was
still
in
turmoil,
though
Bronn
reported
that
the
fires
were
quenched
and
most
of
the
roving
mobs
dispersed.
Much
as
Tyrion
yearned
for
the
comfort
of
Shae’s
arms,
he
realized
he
would
go
nowhere
that
night.

Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
delivered
the
butcher’s
bill
as
he
was
supping
on
a
cold
capon
and
brown
bread
in
the
gloom
of
his
solar.
Dusk
had
faded
to
darkness
by
then,
but
when
his
servants
came
to
light
his
candles
and
start
a
fire
in
the
hearth,
Tyrion
had
roared
at
them
and
sent
them
running.
His
mood
was
as
black
as
the
chamber,
and
Bywater
said
nothing
to
lighten
it.

The
list
of
the
slain
was
topped
by
the
High
Septon,
ripped
apart
as
he
squealed
to
his
gods
for
mercy.
Starving
men
take
a
hard
view
of
priests
too
fat
to
walk,
Tyrion
reflected.

Ser
Preston’s
corpse
had
been
overlooked
at
first;
the
gold
cloaks
had
been
searching
for
a
knight
in
white
armor,
and
he
had
been
stabbed
and
hacked
so
cruelly
that
he
was
red-brown
from
head
to
heel.

Ser
Aron
Santagar
had
been
found
in
a
gutter,
his
head
a
red
pulp
inside
a
crushed
helm.

Lady
Tanda’s
daughter
had
surrendered
her
maidenhood
to
half
a
hundred
shouting
men
behind
a
tanner’s
shop.
The
gold
cloaks
found
her
wandering
naked
on
Sowbelly
Row.

Tyrek
was
still
missing,
as
was
the
High
Septon’s
crystal
crown.
Nine
gold
cloaks
had
been
slain,
two
score
wounded.
No
one
had
troubled
to
count
how
many
of
the
mob
had
died.

“I
want
Tyrek
found,
alive
or
dead,”
Tyrion
said
curtly
when
Bywater
was
done.
“He’s
no
more
than
a
boy.
Son
to
my
late
uncle
Tygett.
His
father
was
always
kind
to
me.”

“We’ll
find
him.
The
septon’s
crown
as
well.”

“The
Others
can
bugger
each
other
with
the
septon’s
crown,
for
all
I
care.”

“When
you
named
me
to
command
the
Watch,
you
told
me
you
wanted
plain
truth,
always.”

“Somehow
I
have
a
feeling
I
am
not
going
to
like
whatever
you’re
about
to
say,”
Tyrion
said
gloomily.

“We
held
the
city
today,
my
lord,
but
I
make
no
promises
for
the
morrow.
The
kettle
is
close
to
boiling.
So
many
thieves
and
murderers
are
abroad
that
no
man’s
house
is
safe,
the
bloody
flux
is
spreading
in
the
stews
along
Pisswater
Bend,
there’s
no
food
to
be
had
for
copper
nor
silver.
Where
before
you
heard
only
mutterings
from
the
gutter,
now
there’s
open
talk
of
treason
in
guildhalls
and
markets.”

“Do
you
need
more
men?”

“I
do
not
trust
half
the
men
I
have
now.
Slynt
tripled
the
size
of
the
Watch,
but
it
takes
more
than
a
gold
cloak
to
make
a
watchman.
There
are
good
men
and
loyal
among
the
new
recruits,
but
also
more
brutes,
sots,
cravens,
and
traitors
than
you’d
care
to
know.
They’re
half-trained
and
undisciplined,
and
what
loyalty
they
have
is
to
their
own
skins.
If
it
comes
to
battle,
they’ll
not
hold,
I
fear.”

“I
never
expected
them
to,”
said
Tyrion.
“Once
our
walls
are
breeched,
we
are
lost,
I’ve
known
that
from
the
start.”

“My
men
are
largely
drawn
from
the
smallfolk.
They
walk
the
same
streets,
drink
in
the
same
winesinks,
spoon
down
their
bowls
of
brown
in
the
same
pot-shops.
Your
eunuch
must
have
told
you,
there
is
small
love
for
the
Lannisters
in
King’s
Landing.
Many
still
remember
how
your
lord
father
sacked
the
city,
when
Aerys
opened
the
gates
to
him.
They
whisper
that
the
gods
are
punishing
us
for
the
sins
of
your
House—for
your
brother’s
murder
of
King
Aerys,
for
the
butchery
of
Rhaegar’s
children,
for
the
execution
of
Eddard
Stark
and
the
savagery
of
Joffrey’s
justice.
Some
talk
openly
of
how
much
better
things
were
when
Robert
was
king,
and
hint
that
times
would
be
better
again
with
Stannis
on
the
throne.
In
pot-shops
and
winesinks
and
brothels,
you
hear
these
things—and
in
the
barracks
and
guardhalls
as
well,
I
fear.”

“They
hate
my
family,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?”

“Aye…
and
will
turn
on
them,
if
the
chance
comes.”

“Me
as
well?”

“Ask
your
eunuch.”

“I’m
asking
you.”

Bywater’s
deep-set
eyes
met
the
dwarf’s
mismatched
ones,
and
did
not
blink.
“You
most
of
all,
my
lord.”

“Most
of
all?”
The
injustice
was
like
to
choke
him.
“It
was
Joffrey
who
told
them
to
eat
their
dead,
Joffrey
who
set
his
dog
on
them.
How
could
they
blame
me?”

“His
Grace
is
but
a
boy.
In
the
streets,
it
is
said
that
he
has
evil
councillors.
The
queen
has
never
been
known
as
a
friend
to
the
commons,
nor
is
Lord
Varys
called
the
Spider
out
of
love…
but
it
is
you
they
blame
most.
Your
sister
and
the
eunuch
were
here
when
times
were
better
under
King
Robert,
but
you
were
not.
They
say
that
you’ve
filled
the
city
with
swaggering
sellswords
and
unwashed
savages,
brutes
who
take
what
they
want
and
follow
no
laws
but
their
own.
They
say
you
exiled
Janos
Slynt
because
you
found
him
too
bluff
and
honest
for
your
liking.
They
say
you
threw
wise
and
gentle
Pycelle
into
the
dungeons
when
he
dared
raise
his
voice
against
you.
Some
even
claim
that
you
mean
to
seize
the
Iron
Throne
for
your
own.”

“Yes,
and
I
am
a
monster
besides,
hideous
and
misshapen,
never
forget
that.”
His
hand
coiled
into
a
fist.
“I’ve
heard
enough.
We
both
have
work
to
attend
to.
Leave
me.”

Perhaps
my
lord
father
was
right
to
despise
me
all
these
years,
if
this
is
the
best
I
can
achieve,
Tyrion
thought
when
he
was
alone.
He
stared
down
at
the
remains
of
his
supper,
his
belly
roiling
at
the
sight
of
the
cold
greasy
capon.
Disgusted,
he
pushed
it
away,
shouted
for
Pod,
and
sent
the
boy
running
to
summon
Varys
and
Bronn.
My
most
trusted
advisers
are
a
eunuch
and
a
sellsword,
and
my
lady’s
a
whore.
What
does
that
say
of
me?

Bronn
complained
of
the
gloom
when
he
arrived,
and
insisted
on
a
fire
in
the
hearth.
It
was
blazing
by
the
time
Varys
made
his
appearance.
“Where
have
you
been?”
Tyrion
demanded.

“About
the
king’s
business,
my
sweet
lord.”

“Ah,
yes,
the
king,”
Tyrion
muttered.
“My
nephew
is
not
fit
to
sit
a
privy,
let
alone
the
Iron
Throne.”

Varys
shrugged.
“An
apprentice
must
be
taught
his
trade.”

“Half
the
’prentices
on
Reeking
Lane
could
rule
better
than
this
king
of
yours.”
Bronn
seated
himself
across
the
table
and
pulled
a
wing
off
the
capon.

Tyrion
had
made
a
practice
of
ignoring
the
sellsword’s
frequent
insolences,
but
tonight
he
found
it
galling.
“I
don’t
recall
giving
you
leave
to
finish
my
supper.”

“You
didn’t
look
to
be
eating
it,”
Bronn
said
through
a
mouthful
of
meat.
“City’s
starving,
it’s
a
crime
to
waste
food.
You
have
any
wine?”

Next
he’ll
want
me
to
pour
it
for
him,
Tyrion
thought
darkly.
“You
go
too
far,”
he
warned.

“And
you
never
go
far
enough.”
Bronn
tossed
the
wingbone
to
the
rushes.
“Ever
think
how
easy
life
would
be
if
the
other
one
had
been
born
first?”
He
thrust
his
fingers
inside
the
capon
and
tore
off
a
handful
of
breast.
“The
weepy
one,
Tommen.
Seems
like
he’d
do
whatever
he
was
told,
as
a
good
king
should.”

A
chill
crept
down
Tyrion’s
spine
as
he
realized
what
the
sellsword
was
hinting
at.
If
Tommen
was
king…

There
was
only
one
way
Tommen
would
become
king.
No,
he
could
not
even
think
it.
Joffrey
was
his
own
blood,
and
Jaime’s
son
as
much
as
Cersei’s.
“I
could
have
your
head
off
for
saying
that,”
he
told
Bronn,
but
the
sellsword
only
laughed.

“Friends,”
said
Varys,
“quarreling
will
not
serve
us.
I
beg
you
both,
take
heart.”

“Whose?”
asked
Tyrion
sourly.
He
could
think
of
several
tempting
choices.





DAVOS

Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
wore
no
armor.
He
sat
a
sorrel
stallion,
his
standard-bearer
a
dapple
grey.
Above
them
flapped
Baratheon’s
crowned
stag
and
the
crossed
quills
of
Penrose,
white
on
a
russet
field.
Ser
Cortnay’s
spade-shaped
beard
was
russet
as
well,
though
he’d
gone
wholly
bald
on
top.
If
the
size
and
splendor
of
the
king’s
party
impressed
him,
it
did
not
show
on
that
weathered
face.

They
trotted
up
with
much
clinking
of
chain
and
rattle
of
plate.
Even
Davos
wore
mail,
though
he
could
not
have
said
why;
his
shoulders
and
lower
back
ached
from
the
unaccustomed
weight.
It
made
him
feel
cumbered
and
foolish,
and
he
wondered
once
more
why
he
was
here.
It
is
not
for
me
to
question
the
king’s
commands,
and
yet…

Every
man
of
the
party
was
of
better
birth
and
higher
station
than
Davos
Seaworth,
and
the
great
lords
glittered
in
the
morning
sun.
Silvered
steel
and
gold
inlay
brightened
their
armor,
and
their
warhelms
were
crested
in
a
riot
of
silken
plumes,
feathers,
and
cunningly
wrought
heraldic
beasts
with
gemstone
eyes.
Stannis
himself
looked
out
of
place
in
this
rich
and
royal
company.
Like
Davos,
the
king
was
plainly
garbed
in
wool
and
boiled
leather,
though
the
circlet
of
red
gold
about
his
temples
lent
him
a
certain
grandeur.
Sunlight
flashed
off
its
flame-shaped
points
whenever
he
moved
his
head.

This
was
the
closest
Davos
had
come
to
His
Grace
in
the
eight
days
since
Black
Betha
had
joined
the
rest
of
the
fleet
off
Storm’s
End.
He’d
sought
an
audience
within
an
hour
of
his
arrival,
only
to
be
told
that
the
king
was
occupied.
The
king
was
often
occupied,
Davos
learned
from
his
son
Devan,
one
of
the
royal
squires.
Now
that
Stannis
Baratheon
had
come
into
his
power,
the
lordlings
buzzed
around
him
like
flies
round
a
corpse.
He
looks
half
a
corpse
too,
years
older
than
when
I
left
Dragonstone.
Devan
said
the
king
scarcely
slept
of
late.
“Since
Lord
Renly
died,
he
has
been
troubled
by
terrible
nightmares,”
the
boy
had
confided
to
his
father.
“Maester’s
potions
do
not
touch
them.
Only
the
Lady
Melisandre
can
soothe
him
to
sleep.”

Is
that
why
she
shares
his
pavilion
now?
Davos
wondered.
To
pray
with
him?
Or
does
she
have
another
way
to
soothe
him
to
sleep?
it
was
an
unworthy
question,
and
one
he
dared
not
ask,
even
of
his
own
son.
Devan
was
a
good
boy,
but
he
wore
the
flaming
heart
proudly
on
his
doublet,
and
his
father
had
seen
him
at
the
nightfires
as
dusk
fell,
beseeching
the
Lord
of
Light
to
bring
the
dawn.
He
is
the
king’s
squire,
he
told
himself,
it
is
only
to
be
expected
that
he
would
take
the
king’s
god.

Davos
had
almost
forgotten
how
high
and
thick
the
walls
of
Storm’s
End
loomed
up
close.
King
Stannis
halted
beneath
them,
a
few
feet
from
Ser
Cortnay
and
his
standard-bearer.
“Ser,”
he
said
with
stiff
courtesy.
He
made
no
move
to
dismount.

“My
lord.”
That
was
less
courteous,
but
not
unexpected.

“It
is
customary
to
grant
a
king
the
style
Your
Grace,”
announced
Lord
Florent.
A
red
gold
fox
poked
its
shining
snout
out
from
his
breastplate
through
a
circle
of
lapis
lazuli
flowers.
Very
tall,
very
courtly,
and
very
rich,
the
Lord
of
Brightwater
Keep
had
been
the
first
of
Renly’s
bannermen
to
declare
for
Stannis,
and
the
first
to
renounce
his
old
gods
and
take
up
the
Lord
of
Light.
Stannis
had
left
his
queen
on
Dragonstone
along
with
her
uncle
Axell,
but
the
queen’s
men
were
more
numerous
and
powerful
than
ever,
and
Alester
Florent
was
the
foremost.

Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
ignored
him,
preferring
to
address
Stannis.
“This
is
a
notable
company.
The
great
lords
Estermont,
Errol,
and
Varner.
Ser
Jon
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways
and
Ser
Bryan
of
the
red.
Lord
Caron
and
Ser
Guyard
of
King
Renly’s
Rainbow
Guard…
and
the
puissant
Lord
Alester
Florent
of
Brightwater,
to
be
sure.
Is
that
your
Onion
Knight
I
spy
to
the
rear?
Well
met,
Ser
Davos.
I
fear
I
do
not
know
the
lady.”

“I
am
named
Melisandre,
ser.”
She
alone
came
unarmored,
but
for
her
flowing
red
robes.
At
her
throat
the
great
ruby
drank
the
daylight.
“I
serve
your
king,
and
the
Lord
of
Light.”

“I
wish
you
well
of
them,
my
lady,”
Ser
Cortnay
answered,
“but
I
bow
to
other
gods,
and
a
different
king.”

“There
is
but
one
true
king,
and
one
true
god,”
announced
Lord
Florent.

“Are
we
here
to
dispute
theology,
my
lord?
Had
I
known,
I
would
have
brought
a
septon.”

“You
know
full
well
why
we
are
here,”
said
Stannis.
“You
have
had
a
fortnight
to
consider
my
offer.
You
sent
your
ravens.
No
help
has
come.
Nor
will
it.
Storm’s
End
stands
alone,
and
I
am
out
of
patience.
One
last
time,
ser,
I
command
you
to
open
your
gates,
and
deliver
me
that
which
is
mine
by
rights.”

“And
the
terms?”
asked
Ser
Cortnay.

“Remain
as
before,”
said
Stannis.
“I
will
pardon
you
for
your
treason,
as
I
have
pardoned
these
lords
you
see
behind
me.
The
men
of
your
garrison
will
be
free
to
enter
my
service
or
to
return
unmolested
to
their
homes.
You
may
keep
your
weapons
and
as
much
property
as
a
man
can
carry.
I
will
require
your
horses
and
pack
animals,
however.”

“And
what
of
Edric
Storm?”

“My
brother’s
bastard
must
be
surrendered
to
me.”

“Then
my
answer
is
still
no,
my
lord.”

The
king
clenched
his
jaw.
He
said
nothing.

Melisandre
spoke
instead.
“May
the
Lord
of
Light
protect
you
in
your
darkness,
Ser
Cortnay.”

“May
the
Others
bugger
your
Lord
of
Light,”
Penrose
spat
back,
“and
wipe
his
arse
with
that
rag
you
bear.”

Lord
Alester
Florent
cleared
his
throat.
“Ser
Cortnay,
mind
your
tongue.
His
Grace
means
the
boy
no
harm.
The
child
is
his
own
blood,
and
mine
as
well.
My
niece
Delena
was
the
mother,
as
all
men
know.
If
you
will
not
trust
to
the
king,
trust
to
me.
You
know
me
for
a
man
of
honor—”

“I
know
you
for
a
man
of
ambition,”
Ser
Cortnay
broke
in.
“A
man
who
changes
kings
and
gods
the
way
I
change
my
boots.
As
do
these
other
turncloaks
I
see
before
me.”

An
angry
clamor
went
up
from
the
king’s
men.
He
is
not
far
wrong,
Davos
thought.
Only
a
short
time
before,
the
Fossoways,
Guyard
Morrigen,
and
the
Lords
Caron,
Varner,
Errol,
and
Estermont
had
all
belonged
to
Renly.
They
had
sat
in
his
pavilion,
helped
him
make
his
battle
plans,
plotted
how
Stannis
might
be
brought
low.
And
Lord
Florent
had
been
with
them—he
might
be
Queen
Selyse’s
own
uncle,
but
that
had
not
kept
the
Lord
of
Brightwater
from
bending
his
knee
to
Renly
when
Renly’s
star
was
rising.

Bryce
Caron
walked
his
horse
forward
a
few
paces,
his
long
rainbow-striped
cloak
twisting
in
the
wind
off
the
bay.
“No
man
here
is
a
turncloak,
ser.
My
fealty
belongs
to
Storm’s
End,
and
King
Stannis
is
its
rightful
lord…
and
our
true
king.
He
is
the
last
of
House
Baratheon,
Robert’s
heir
and
Renly’s.”

“If
that
is
so,
why
is
the
Knight
of
Flowers
not
among
you?
And
where
is
Mathis
Rowan?
Randyll
Tarly?
Lady
Oakheart?
Why
are
they
not
here
in
your
company,
they
who
loved
Renly
best?
Where
is
Brienne
of
Tarth,
I
ask
you?”

“That
one?”
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
laughed
harshly.
“She
ran.
As
well
she
might.
Hers
was
the
hand
that
slew
the
king.”

“A
lie,”
Ser
Cortnay
said.
“I
knew
Brienne
when
she
was
no
more
than
a
girl
playing
at
her
father’s
feet
in
Evenfall
Hall,
and
I
knew
her
still
better
when
the
Evenstar
sent
her
here
to
Storm’s
End.
She
loved
Renly
Baratheon
from
the
first
moment
she
laid
eyes
on
him,
a
blind
man
could
see
it.”

“To
be
sure,”
declared
Lord
Florent
airily,
“and
she
would
scarcely
be
the
first
maid
maddened
to
murder
by
a
man
who
spurned
her.
Though
for
my
own
part,
I
believe
it
was
Lady
Stark
who
slew
the
king.
She
had
journeyed
all
the
way
from
Riverrun
to
plead
for
an
alliance,
and
Renly
had
refused
her.
No
doubt
she
saw
him
as
a
danger
to
her
son,
and
so
removed
him.”

“It
was
Brienne,”
insisted
Lord
Caron.
“Ser
Emmon
Cuy
swore
as
much
before
he
died.
You
have
my
oath
on
that,
Ser
Cortnay.”

Contempt
thickened
Ser
Cortnay’s
voice.
“And
what
is
that
worth?
You
wear
your
cloak
of
many
colors,
I
see.
The
one
Renly
gave
you
when
you
swore
your
oath
to
protect
him.
If
he
is
dead,
how
is
it
you
are
not?”
He
turned
his
scorn
on
Guyard
Morrigen.
“I
might
ask
the
same
of
you,
ser.
Guyard
the
Green,
yes?
Of
the
Rainbow
Guard?
Sworn
to
give
his
own
life
for
his
king’s?
if
I
had
such
a
cloak,
I
would
be
ashamed
to
wear
it.”

Morrigen
bristled.
“Be
glad
this
is
a
parley,
Penrose,
or
I
would
have
your
tongue
for
those
words.”

“And
cast
it
in
the
same
fire
where
you
left
your
manhood?”

“Enough!”
Stannis
said.
“The
Lord
of
Light
willed
that
my
brother
die
for
his
treason.
Who
did
the
deed
matters
not.”

“Not
to
you,
perhaps,”
said
Ser
Cortnay.
“I
have
heard
your
proposal,
Lord
Stannis.
Now
here
is
mine.”
He
pulled
off
his
glove
and
flung
it
full
in
the
king’s
face.
“Single
combat.
Sword,
lance,
or
any
weapon
you
care
to
name.
Or
if
you
fear
to
hazard
your
magic
sword
and
royal
skin
against
an
old
man,
name
you
a
champion,
and
I
shall
do
the
same.”
He
gave
Guyard
Morrigen
and
Bryce
Caron
a
scathing
look.
“Either
of
these
pups
would
do
nicely,
I
should
think.”

Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
grew
dark
with
fury.
“I
will
take
up
the
gage,
if
it
please
the
king.”

“As
would
I.”
Bryce
Caron
looked
to
Stannis.

The
king
ground
his
teeth.
“No.”

Ser
Cortnay
did
not
seem
surprised.
“Is
it
the
justice
of
your
cause
you
doubt,
my
lord,
or
the
strength
of
your
arm?
Are
you
afraid
I’ll
piss
on
your
burning
sword
and
put
it
out?”

“Do
you
take
me
for
an
utter
fool,
ser?”
asked
Stannis.
“I
have
twenty
thousand
men.
You
are
besieged
by
land
and
sea.
Why
would
I
choose
single
combat
when
my
eventual
victory
is
certain?”
The
king
pointed
a
finger
at
him.
“I
give
you
fair
warning.
If
you
force
me
to
take
my
castle
by
storm,
you
may
expect
no
mercy.
I
will
hang
you
for
traitors,
every
one
of
you.”

“As
the
gods
will
it.
Bring
on
your
storm,
my
lord—and
recall,
if
you
do,
the
name
of
this
castle.”
Ser
Cortnay
gave
a
pull
on
his
reins
and
rode
back
toward
the
gate.

Stannis
said
no
word,
but
turned
his
horse
around
and
started
back
toward
his
camp.
The
others
followed.
“If
we
storm
these
walls
thousands
will
die,”
fretted
ancient
Lord
Estermont,
who
was
the
king’s
grandfather
on
his
mother’s
side.
“Better
to
hazard
but
a
single
life,
surely?
Our
cause
is
righteous,
so
the
gods
must
surely
bless
our
champion’s
arms
with
victory.”

God,
old
man,
thought
Davos.
You
forget,
we
have
only
one
now,
Melisandre’s
Lord
of
Light.

Ser
Jon
Fossoway
said,
“I
would
gladly
take
this
challenge
myself,
though
I’m
not
half
the
swordsman
Lord
Caron
is,
or
Ser
Guyard.
Renly
left
no
notable
knights
at
Storm’s
End.
Garrison
duty
is
for
old
men
and
green
boys.”

Lord
Caron
agreed.
“An
easy
victory,
to
be
sure.
And
what
glory,
to
win
Storm’s
End
with
a
single
stroke!”

Stannis
raked
them
all
with
a
look.
“You
chatter
like
magpies,
and
with
less
sense.
I
will
have
quiet.”
The
king’s
eyes
fell
on
Davos.
“Ser.
Ride
with
me.”
He
spurred
his
horse
away
from
his
followers.
Only
Melisandre
kept
pace,
bearing
the
great
standard
of
the
fiery
heart
with
the
crowned
stag
within.
As
if
it
had
been
swallowed
whole.

Davos
saw
the
looks
that
passed
between
the
lordlings
as
he
rode
past
them
to
join
the
king.
These
were
no
onion
knights,
but
proud
men
from
houses
whose
names
were
old
in
honor.
Somehow
he
knew
that
Renly
had
never
chided
them
in
such
a
fashion.
The
youngest
of
the
Baratheons
had
been
born
with
a
gift
for
easy
courtesy
that
his
brother
sadly
lacked.

He
eased
back
to
a
slow
trot
when
his
horse
came
up
beside
the
king’s.
“Your
Grace.”
Seen
at
close
hand,
Stannis
looked
worse
than
Davos
had
realized
from
afar.
His
face
had
grown
haggard,
and
he
had
dark
circles
under
his
eyes.

“A
smuggler
must
be
a
fair
judge
of
men,”
the
king
said.
“What
do
you
make
of
this
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose?”

“A
stubborn
man,”
said
Davos
carefully.

“Hungry
for
death,
I
call
it.
He
throws
my
pardon
in
my
face.
Aye,
and
throws
his
life
away
in
the
bargain,
and
the
lives
of
every
man
inside
those
walls.
Single
combat?”
The
king
snorted
in
derision.
“No
doubt
he
mistook
me
for
Robert.”

“More
like
he
was
desperate.
What
other
hope
does
he
have?”

“None.
The
castle
will
fall.
But
how
to
do
it
quickly?”
Stannis
brooded
on
that
for
a
moment.
Under
the
steady
clop-clop
of
hooves,
Davos
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
the
king
grinding
his
teeth.
“Lord
Alester
urges
me
to
bring
old
Lord
Penrose
here.
Ser
Cortnay’s
father.
You
know
the
man,
I
believe?”

“When
I
came
as
your
envoy,
Lord
Penrose
received
me
more
courteously
than
most,”
Davos
said.
“He
is
an
old
done
man,
sire.
Sickly
and
failing.”

“Florent
would
have
him
fail
more
visibly.
In
his
son’s
sight,
with
a
noose
about
his
neck.”

It
was
dangerous
to
oppose
the
queen’s
men,
but
Davos
had
vowed
always
to
tell
his
king
the
truth.
“I
think
that
would
be
ill
done,
my
liege.
Ser
Cortnay
will
watch
his
father
die
before
he
would
ever
betray
his
trust.
It
would
gain
us
nothing,
and
bring
dishonor
to
our
cause.”

“What
dishonor?”
Stannis
bristled.
“Would
you
have
me
spare
the
lives
of
traitors?”

“You
have
spared
the
lives
of
those
behind
us.”

“Do
you
scold
me
for
that,
smuggler?”

“It
is
not
my
place.”
Davos
feared
he
had
said
too
much.

The
king
was
relentless.
“You
esteem
this
Penrose
more
than
you
do
my
lords
bannermen.
Why?”

“He
keeps
faith.”

“A
misplaced
faith
in
a
dead
usurper.”

“Yes,”
Davos
admitted,
“but
still,
he
keeps
faith.”

“As
those
behind
us
do
not?”

Davos
had
come
too
far
with
Stannis
to
play
coy
now.
“Last
year
they
were
Robert’s
men.
A
moon
ago
they
were
Renly’s.
This
morning
they
are
yours.
Whose
will
they
be
on
the
morrow?”

And
Stannis
laughed.
A
sudden
gust,
rough
and
full
of
scorn.
“I
told
you,
Melisandre,”
he
said
to
the
red
woman,
“my
Onion
Knight
tells
me
the
truth.”

“I
see
you
know
him
well,
Your
Grace,”
the
red
woman
said.

“Davos,
I
have
missed
you
sorely,”
the
king
said.
“Aye,
I
have
a
tail
of
traitors,
your
nose
does
not
deceive
you.
My
lords
bannermen
are
inconstant
even
in
their
treasons.
I
need
them,
but
you
should
know
how
it
sickens
me
to
pardon
such
as
these
when
I
have
punished
better
men
for
lesser
crimes.
You
have
every
right
to
reproach
me,
Ser
Davos.”

“You
reproach
yourself
more
than
I
ever
could,
Your
Grace.
You
must
have
these
great
lords
to
win
your
throne—”

“Fingers
and
all,
it
seems.”
Stannis
smiled
grimly.

Unthinking,
Davos
raised
his
maimed
hand
to
the
pouch
at
his
throat,
and
felt
the
fingerbones
within.
Luck.

The
king
saw
the
motion.
“Are
they
still
there,
Onion
Knight?
You
have
not
lost
them?”

“No.”

“Why
do
you
keep
them?
I
have
often
wondered.”

“They
remind
me
of
what
I
was.
Where
I
came
from.
They
remind
me
of
your
justice,
my
liege.”

“It
was
justice,”
Stannis
said.
“A
good
act
does
not
wash
out
the
bad,
nor
a
bad
act
the
good.
Each
should
have
its
own
reward.
You
were
a
hero
and
a
smuggler.”
He
glanced
behind
at
Lord
Florent
and
the
others,
rainbow
knights
and
turncloaks,
who
were
following
at
a
distance.
“These
pardoned
lords
would
do
well
to
reflect
on
that.
Good
men
and
true
will
fight
for
Joffrey,
wrongly
believing
him
the
true
king.
A
northman
might
even
say
the
same
of
Robb
Stark.
But
these
lords
who
flocked
to
my
brother’s
banners
knew
him
for
a
usurper.
They
turned
their
backs
on
their
rightful
king
for
no
better
reason
than
dreams
of
power
and
glory,
and
I
have
marked
them
for
what
they
are.
Pardoned
them,
yes.
Forgiven.
But
not
forgotten.”
He
fell
silent
for
a
moment,
brooding
on
his
plans
for
justice.
And
then,
abruptly,
he
said,
“What
do
the
smallfolk
say
of
Renly’s
death?”

“They
grieve.
Your
brother
was
well
loved.”

“Fools
love
a
fool,”
grumbled
Stannis,
“but
I
grieve
for
him
as
well.
For
the
boy
he
was,
not
the
man
he
grew
to
be.”
He
was
silent
for
a
time,
and
then
he
said,
“How
did
the
commons
take
the
news
of
Cersei’s
incest?”

“While
we
were
among
them
they
shouted
for
King
Stannis.
I
cannot
speak
for
what
they
said
once
we
had
sailed.”

“So
you
do
not
think
they
believed?”

“When
I
was
smuggling,
I
learned
that
some
men
believe
everything
and
some
nothing.
We
met
both
sorts.
And
there
is
another
tale
being
spread
as
well—”

“Yes.”
Stannis
bit
off
the
word.
“Selyse
has
given
me
horns,
and
tied
a
fool’s
bells
to
the
end
of
each.
My
daughter
fathered
by
a
halfwit
jester!
A
tale
as
vile
as
it
is
absurd.
Renly
threw
it
in
my
teeth
when
we
met
to
parley.
You
would
need
to
be
as
mad
as
Patchface
to
believe
such
a
thing.”

“That
may
be
so,
my
liege…
but
whether
they
believe
the
story
or
no,
they
delight
to
tell
it.”
In
many
places
it
had
come
before
them,
poisoning
the
well
for
their
own
true
tale.

“Robert
could
piss
in
a
cup
and
men
would
call
it
wine,
but
I
offer
them
pure
cold
water
and
they
squint
in
suspicion
and
mutter
to
each
other
about
how
queer
it
tastes.”
Stannis
ground
his
teeth.
“If
someone
said
I
had
magicked
myself
into
a
boar
to
kill
Robert,
likely
they
would
believe
that
as
well.”

“You
cannot
stop
them
talking,
my
liege,”
Davos
said,
“but
when
you
take
your
vengeance
on
your
brothers’
true
killers,
the
realm
will
know
such
tales
for
lies.”

Stannis
only
seemed
to
half
hear
him.
“I
have
no
doubt
that
Cersei
had
a
hand
in
Robert’s
death.
I
will
have
justice
for
him.
Aye,
and
for
Ned
Stark
and
Jon
Arryn
as
well.”

“And
for
Renly?”
The
words
were
out
before
Davos
could
stop
to
consider
them.

For
a
long
time
the
king
did
not
speak.
Then,
very
softly,
he
said,
“I
dream
of
it
sometimes.
Of
Renly’s
dying.
A
green
tent,
candles,
a
woman
screaming.
And
blood.”
Stannis
looked
down
at
his
hands.
“I
was
still
abed
when
he
died.
Your
Devan
will
tell
you.
He
tried
to
wake
me.
Dawn
was
nigh
and
my
lords
were
waiting,
fretting.
I
should
have
been
ahorse,
armored.
I
knew
Renly
would
attack
at
break
of
day.
Devan
says
I
thrashed
and
cried
out,
but
what
does
it
matter?
It
was
a
dream.
I
was
in
my
tent
when
Renly
died,
and
when
I
woke
my
hands
were
clean.”

Ser
Davos
Seaworth
could
feel
his
phantom
fingertips
start
to
itch.
Something
is
wrong
here,
the
onetime
smuggler
thought.
Yet
he
nodded
and
said,
“I
see.”

“Renly
offered
me
a
peach.
At
our
parley.
Mocked
me,
defied
me,
threatened
me,
and
offered
me
a
peach.
I
thought
he
was
drawing
a
blade
and
went
for
mine
own.
Was
that
his
purpose,
to
make
me
show
fear?
Or
was
it
one
of
his
pointless
jests?
When
he
spoke
of
how
sweet
the
peach
was,
did
his
words
have
some
hidden
meaning?”
The
king
gave
a
shake
of
his
head,
like
a
dog
shaking
a
rabbit
to
snap
its
neck.
“Only
Renly
could
vex
me
so
with
a
piece
of
fruit.
He
brought
his
doom
on
himself
with
his
treason,
but
I
did
love
him,
Davos.
I
know
that
now.
I
swear,
I
will
go
to
my
grave
thinking
of
my
brother’s
peach.”

By
then
they
were
in
amongst
the
camp,
riding
past
the
ordered
rows
of
tents,
the
blowing
banners,
and
the
stacks
of
shields
and
spears.
The
stink
of
horse
dung
was
heavy
in
the
air,
mingled
with
the
woodsmoke
and
the
smell
of
cooking
meat.
Stannis
reined
up
long
enough
to
bark
a
brusque
dismissal
to
Lord
Florent
and
the
others,
commanding
them
to
attend
him
in
his
pavilion
one
hour
hence
for
a
council
of
war.
They
bowed
their
heads
and
dispersed,
while
Davos
and
Melisandre
rode
to
the
king’s
pavilion.

The
tent
had
to
be
large,
since
it
was
there
his
lords
bannermen
came
to
council.
Yet
there
was
nothing
grand
about
it.
It
was
a
soldier’s
tent
of
heavy
canvas,
dyed
the
dark
yellow
that
sometimes
passed
for
gold.
Only
the
royal
banner
that
streamed
atop
the
center
pole
marked
it
as
a
king’s.
That,
and
the
guards
without;
queen’s
men
leaning
on
tall
spears,
with
the
badge
of
the
fiery
heart
sewn
over
their
own.

Grooms
came
up
to
help
them
dismount.
One
of
the
guards
relieved
Melisandre
of
her
cumbersome
standard,
driving
the
staff
deep
into
the
soft
ground.
Devan
stood
to
one
side
of
the
door,
waiting
to
lift
the
flap
for
the
king.
An
older
squire
waited
beside
him.
Stannis
took
off
his
crown
and
handed
it
to
Devan.
“Cold
water,
cups
for
two.
Davos,
attend
me.
My
lady,
I
shall
send
for
you
when
I
require
you.”

“As
the
king
commands.”
Melisandre
bowed.

After
the
brightness
of
the
morning,
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
seemed
cool
and
dim.
Stannis
seated
himself
on
a
plain
wooden
camp
stool
and
waved
Davos
to
another.
“One
day
I
may
make
you
a
lord,
smuggler.
If
only
to
irk
Celtigar
and
Florent.
You
will
not
thank
me,
though.
It
will
mean
you
must
suffer
through
these
councils,
and
feign
interest
in
the
braying
of
mules.”

“Why
do
you
have
them,
if
they
serve
no
purpose?”

“The
mules
love
the
sound
of
their
own
braying,
why
else?
And
I
need
them
to
haul
my
cart.
Oh,
to
be
sure,
once
in
a
great
while
some
useful
notion
is
put
forth.
But
not
today,
I
think—ah,
here’s
your
son
with
our
water.”

Devan
set
the
tray
on
the
table
and
filled
two
clay
cups.
The
king
sprinkled
a
pinch
of
salt
in
his
cup
before
he
drank;
Davos
took
his
water
straight,
wishing
it
were
wine.
“You
were
speaking
of
your
council?”

“Let
me
tell
you
how
it
will
go.
Lord
Velaryon
will
urge
me
to
storm
the
castle
walls
at
first
light,
grapnels
and
scaling
ladders
against
arrows
and
boiling
oil.
The
young
mules
will
think
this
a
splendid
notion.
Estermont
will
favor
settling
down
to
starve
them
out,
as
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
once
tried
with
me.
That
might
take
a
year,
but
old
mules
are
patient.
And
Lord
Caron
and
the
others
who
like
to
kick
will
want
to
take
up
Ser
Cortnay’s
gauntlet
and
hazard
all
upon
a
single
combat.
Each
one
imagining
he
will
be
my
champion
and
win
undying
fame.”
The
king
finished
his
water.
“What
would
you
have
me
do,
smuggler?”

Davos
considered
a
moment
before
he
answered.
“Strike
for
King’s
Landing
at
once.”

The
king
snorted.
“And
leave
Storm’s
End
untaken?”

“Ser
Cortnay
does
not
have
the
power
to
harm
you.
The
Lannisters
do.
A
siege
would
take
too
long,
single
combat
is
too
chancy,
and
an
assault
would
cost
thousands
of
lives
with
no
certainty
of
success.
And
there
is
no
need.
Once
you
dethrone
Joffrey
this
castle
must
come
to
you
with
all
the
rest.
It
is
said
about
the
camp
that
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
rushes
west
to
rescue
Lannisport
from
the
vengeance
of
the
northmen…”

“You
have
a
passing
clever
father,
Devan,”
the
king
told
the
boy
standing
by
his
elbow.
“He
makes
me
wish
I
had
more
smugglers
in
my
service.
And
fewer
lords.
Though
you
are
wrong
in
one
respect,
Davos.
There
is
a
need.
If
I
leave
Storm’s
End
untaken
in
my
rear,
it
will
be
said
I
was
defeated
here.
And
that
I
cannot
permit.
Men
do
not
love
me
as
they
loved
my
brothers.
They
follow
me
because
they
fear
me…
and
defeat
is
death
to
fear.
The
castle
must
fall.”
His
jaw
ground
side
to
side.
“Aye,
and
quickly.
Doran
Martell
has
called
his
banners
and
fortified
the
mountain
passes.
His
Dornishmen
are
poised
to
sweep
down
onto
the
Marches.
And
Highgarden
is
far
from
spent.
My
brother
left
the
greater
part
of
his
power
at
Bitterbridge,
near
sixty
thousand
foot.
I
sent
my
wife’s
brother
Ser
Errol
with
Ser
Parmen
Crane
to
take
them
under
my
command,
but
they
have
not
returned.
I
fear
that
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
reached
Bitterbridge
before
my
envoys,
and
took
that
host
for
his
own.”

“All
the
more
reason
to
take
King’s
Landing
as
soon
as
we
may.
Salladhor
Saan
told
me—”

“Salladhor
Saan
thinks
only
of
gold!”
Stannis
exploded.
“His
head
is
full
of
dreams
of
the
treasure
he
fancies
lies
under
the
Red
Keep,
so
let
us
hear
no
more
of
Salladhor
Saan.
The
day
I
need
military
counsel
from
a
Lysene
brigand
is
the
day
I
put
off
my
crown
and
take
the
black.”
The
king
made
a
fist.
“Are
you
here
to
serve
me,
smuggler?
Or
to
vex
me
with
arguments?”

“I
am
yours,”
Davos
said.

“Then
hear
me.
Ser
Cortnay’s
lieutenant
is
cousin
to
the
Fossoways.
Lord
Meadows,
a
green
boy
of
twenty.
Should
some
ill
chance
strike
down
Penrose,
command
of
Storm’s
End
would
pass
to
this
stripling,
and
his
cousins
believe
he
would
accept
my
terms
and
yield
up
the
castle.”

“I
remember
another
stripling
who
was
given
command
of
Storm’s
End.
He
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
twenty.”

“Lord
Meadows
is
not
as
stonehead
stubborn
as
I
was.”

“Stubborn
or
craven,
what
does
it
matter?
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
seemed
hale
and
hearty
to
me.”

“So
did
my
brother,
the
day
before
his
death.
The
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors,
Davos.”

Davos
Seaworth
felt
the
small
hairs
rising
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
“My
lord,
I
do
not
understand
you.”

“I
do
not
require
your
understanding.
Only
your
service.
Ser
Cortnay
will
be
dead
within
the
day.
Melisandre
has
seen
it
in
the
flames
of
the
future.
His
death
and
the
manner
of
it.
He
will
not
die
in
knightly
combat,
needless
to
say.”
Stannis
held
out
his
cup,
and
Devan
filled
it
again
from
the
flagon.
“Her
flames
do
not
lie.
She
saw
Renly’s
doom
as
well.
On
Dragonstone
she
saw
it,
and
told
Selyse.
Lord
Velaryon
and
your
friend
Salladhor
Saan
would
have
had
me
sail
against
Joffrey,
but
Melisandre
told
me
that
if
I
went
to
Storm’s
End,
I
would
win
the
best
part
of
my
brother’s
power,
and
she
was
right.”

“B-but,”
Davos
stammered,
“Lord
Renly
only
came
here
because
you
had
laid
siege
to
the
castle.
He
was
marching
toward
King’s
Landing
before,
against
the
Lannisters,
he
would
have—”

Stannis
shifted
in
his
seat,
frowning.
“Was,
would
have,
what
is
that?
He
did
what
he
did.
He
came
here
with
his
banners
and
his
peaches,
to
his
doom…
and
it
was
well
for
me
he
did.
Melisandre
saw
another
day
in
her
flames
as
well.
A
morrow
where
Renly
rode
out
of
the
south
in
his
green
armor
to
smash
my
host
beneath
the
walls
of
King’s
Landing.
Had
I
met
my
brother
there,
it
might
have
been
me
who
died
in
place
of
him.”

“Or
you
might
have
joined
your
strength
to
his
to
bring
down
the
Lannisters,”
Davos
protested.
“Why
not
that?
If
she
saw
two
futures,
well…
both
cannot
be
true.”

King
Stannis
pointed
a
finger.
“There
you
err,
Onion
Knight.
Some
lights
cast
more
than
one
shadow.
Stand
before
the
nightfire
and
you’ll
see
for
yourself.
The
flames
shift
and
dance,
never
still.
The
shadows
grow
tall
and
short,
and
every
man
casts
a
dozen.
Some
are
fainter
than
others,
that’s
all.
Well,
men
cast
their
shadows
across
the
future
as
well.
One
shadow
or
many.
Melisandre
sees
them
all.

“You
do
not
love
the
woman.
I
know
that,
Davos,
I
am
not
blind.
My
lords
mislike
her
too.
Estermont
thinks
the
flaming
heart
ill-chosen
and
begs
to
fight
beneath
the
crowned
stag
as
of
old.
Ser
Guyard
says
a
woman
should
not
be
my
standard-bearer.
Others
whisper
that
she
has
no
place
in
my
war
councils,
that
I
ought
to
send
her
back
to
Asshai,
that
it
is
sinful
to
keep
her
in
my
tent
of
a
night.
Aye,
they
whisper…
while
she
serves.”

“Serves
how?”
Davos
asked,
dreading
the
answer.

“As
needed.”
The
king
looked
at
him.
“And
you?”

“I…”
Davos
licked
his
lips.
“I
am
yours
to
command.
What
would
you
have
me
do?”

“Nothing
you
have
not
done
before.
Only
land
a
boat
beneath
the
castle,
unseen,
in
the
black
of
night.
Can
you
do
that?”

“Yes.
Tonight?”

The
king
gave
a
curt
nod.
“You
will
need
a
small
boat.
Not
Black
Betha.
No
one
must
know
what
you
do.”

Davos
wanted
to
protest.
He
was
a
knight
now,
no
longer
a
smuggler,
and
he
had
never
been
an
assassin.
Yet
when
he
opened
his
mouth,
the
words
would
not
come.
This
was
Stannis,
his
just
lord,
to
whom
he
owed
all
he
was.
And
he
had
his
sons
to
consider
as
well.
Gods
be
good,
what
has
she
done
to
him?

“You
are
quiet,”
Stannis
observed.

And
should
remain
so,
Davos
told
himself,
yet
instead
he
said,
“My
liege,
you
must
have
the
castle,
I
see
that
now,
but
surely
there
are
other
ways.
Cleaner
ways.
Let
Ser
Cortnay
keep
the
bastard
boy
and
he
may
well
yield.”

“I
must
have
the
boy,
Davos.
Must.
Melisandre
has
seen
that
in
the
flames
as
well.”

Davos
groped
for
some
other
answer.
“Storm’s
End
holds
no
knight
who
can
match
Ser
Guyard
or
Lord
Caron,
or
any
of
a
hundred
others
sworn
to
your
service.
This
single
combat…
could
it
be
that
Ser
Cortnay
seeks
for
a
way
to
yield
with
honor?
Even
if
it
means
his
own
life?”

A
troubled
look
crossed
the
king’s
face
like
a
passing
cloud.
“More
like
he
plans
some
treachery.
There
will
be
no
combat
of
champions.
Ser
Cortnay
was
dead
before
he
ever
threw
that
glove.
The
flames
do
not
lie,
Davos.”

Yet
they
require
me
to
make
them
true,
he
thought.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
Davos
Seaworth
felt
so
sad.

And
so
it
was
that
he
found
himself
once
more
crossing
Shipbreaker
Bay
in
the
dark
of
night,
steering
a
tiny
boat
with
a
black
sail.
The
sky
was
the
same,
and
the
sea.
The
same
salt
smell
was
in
the
air,
and
the
water
chuckling
against
the
hull
was
just
as
he
remembered
it.
A
thousand
flickering
campfires
burned
around
the
castle,
as
the
fires
of
the
Tyrells
and
Redwynes
had
sixteen
years
before.
But
all
the
rest
was
different.

The
last
time
it
was
life
I
brought
to
Storm’s
End,
shaped
to
look
like
onions.
This
time
it
is
death,
in
the
shape
of
Melisandre
of
Asshai.
Sixteen
years
ago,
the
sails
had
cracked
and
snapped
with
every
shift
of
wind,
until
he’d
pulled
them
down
and
gone
on
with
muffled
oars.
Even
so,
his
heart
had
been
in
his
gullet.
The
men
on
the
Redwyne
galleys
had
grown
lax
after
so
long,
however,
and
they
had
slipped
through
the
cordon
smooth
as
black
satin.
This
time,
the
only
ships
in
sight
belonged
to
Stannis,
and
the
only
danger
would
come
from
watchers
on
the
castle
walls.
Even
so,
Davos
was
taut
as
a
bowstring.

Melisandre
huddled
upon
a
thwart,
lost
in
the
folds
of
a
dark
red
cloak
that
covered
her
from
head
to
heels,
her
face
a
paleness
beneath
the
cowl.
Davos
loved
the
water.
He
slept
best
when
he
had
a
deck
rocking
beneath
him,
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
his
rigging
was
a
sweeter
sound
to
him
than
any
a
singer
could
make
with
his
harp
strings.
Even
the
sea
brought
him
no
comfort
tonight,
though.
“I
can
smell
the
fear
on
you,
ser
knight,”
the
red
woman
said
softly.

“Someone
once
told
me
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.
And
tonight
I
am
no
knight.
Tonight
I
am
Davos
the
smuggler
again.
Would
that
you
were
an
onion.”

She
laughed.
“Is
it
me
you
fear?
Or
what
we
do?”

“What
you
do.
I’ll
have
no
part
of
it.”

“Your
hand
raised
the
sail.
Your
hand
holds
the
tiller.”

Silent,
Davos
tended
to
his
course.
The
shore
was
a
snarl
of
rocks,
so
he
was
taking
them
well
out
across
the
bay.
He
would
wait
for
the
tide
to
turn
before
coming
about.
Storm’s
End
dwindled
behind
them,
but
the
red
woman
seemed
unconcerned.
“Are
you
a
good
man,
Davos
Seaworth?”
she
asked.

Would
a
good
man
be
doing
this?
“I
am
a
man,”
he
said.
“I
am
kind
to
my
wife,
but
I
have
known
other
women.
I
have
tried
to
be
a
father
to
my
sons,
to
help
make
them
a
place
in
this
world.
Aye,
I’ve
broken
laws,
but
I
never
felt
evil
until
tonight.
I
would
say
my
parts
are
mixed,
m’lady.
Good
and
bad.”

“A
grey
man,”
she
said.
“Neither
white
nor
black,
but
partaking
of
both.
Is
that
what
you
are,
Ser
Davos?”

“What
if
I
am?
It
seems
to
me
that
most
men
are
grey.”

“If
half
of
an
onion
is
black
with
rot,
it
is
a
rotten
onion.
A
man
is
good,
or
he
is
evil.”

The
fires
behind
them
had
melted
into
one
vague
glow
against
the
black
sky,
and
the
land
was
almost
out
of
sight.
It
was
time
to
come
about.
“Watch
your
head,
my
lady.”
He
pushed
on
the
tiller,
and
the
small
boat
threw
up
a
curl
of
black
water
as
she
turned.
Melisandre
leaned
under
the
swinging
yard,
one
hand
on
the
gunwale,
calm
as
ever.
Wood
creaked,
canvas
cracked,
and
water
splashed,
so
loudly
a
man
might
swear
the
castle
was
sure
to
hear.
Davos
knew
better.
The
endless
crash
of
wave
on
rock
was
the
only
sound
that
ever
penetrated
the
massive
seaward
walls
of
Storm’s
End,
and
that
but
faintly.

A
rippling
wake
spread
out
behind
as
they
swung
back
toward
the
shore.
“You
speak
of
men
and
onions,”
Davos
said
to
Melisandre.
“What
of
women?
Is
it
not
the
same
for
them?
Are
you
good
or
evil,
my
lady?”

That
made
her
chuckle.
“Oh,
good.
I
am
a
knight
of
sorts
myself,
sweet
ser.
A
champion
of
light
and
life.”

“Yet
you
mean
to
kill
a
man
tonight,”
he
said.
“As
you
killed
Maester
Cressen.”

“Your
maester
poisoned
himself.
He
meant
to
poison
me,
but
I
was
protected
by
a
greater
power
and
he
was
not.”

“And
Renly
Baratheon?
Who
was
it
who
killed
him?”

Her
head
turned.
Beneath
the
shadow
of
the
cowl,
her
eyes
burned
like
pale
red
candle
flames.
“Not
I.”

“Liar.”
Davos
was
certain
now.

Melisandre
laughed
again.
“You
are
lost
in
darkness
and
confusion,
Ser
Davos.”

“And
a
good
thing.”
Davos
gestured
at
the
distant
lights
flickering
along
the
walls
of
Storm’s
End.
“Feel
how
cold
the
wind
is?
The
guards
will
huddle
close
to
those
torches.
A
little
warmth,
a
little
light,
they’re
a
comfort
on
a
night
like
this.
Yet
that
will
blind
them,
so
they
will
not
see
us
pass.”
I
hope.
“The
god
of
darkness
protects
us
now,
my
lady.
Even
you.”

The
flames
of
her
eyes
seemed
to
burn
a
little
brighter
at
that.
“Speak
not
that
name,
ser.
Lest
you
draw
his
black
eye
upon
us.
He
protects
no
man,
I
promise
you.
He
is
the
enemy
of
all
that
lives.
It
is
the
torches
that
hide
us,
you
have
said
so
yourself.
Fire.
The
bright
gift
of
the
Lord
of
Light.”

“Have
it
your
way.”

“His
way,
rather.”

The
wind
was
shifting,
Davos
could
feel
it,
see
it
in
the
way
the
black
canvas
rippled.
He
reached
for
the
halyards.
“Help
me
bring
in
the
sail.
I’ll
row
us
the
rest
of
the
way.”

Together
they
tied
off
the
sail
as
the
boat
rocked
beneath
them.
As
Davos
unshipped
the
oars
and
slid
them
into
the
choppy
black
water,
he
said,
“Who
rowed
you
to
Renly?”

“There
was
no
need,”
she
said.
“He
was
unprotected.
But
here…
this
Storm’s
End
is
an
old
place.
There
are
spells
woven
into
the
stones.
Dark
walls
that
no
shadow
can
pass—ancient,
forgotten,
yet
still
in
place.”

“Shadow?”
Davos
felt
his
flesh
prickling.
“A
shadow
is
a
thing
of
darkness.”

“You
are
more
ignorant
than
a
child,
ser
knight.
There
are
no
shadows
in
the
dark.
Shadows
are
the
servants
of
light,
the
children
of
fire.
The
brightest
flame
casts
the
darkest
shadows.”

Frowning,
Davos
hushed
her
then.
They
were
coming
close
to
shore
once
more,
and
voices
carried
across
the
water.
He
rowed,
the
faint
sound
of
his
oars
lost
in
the
rhythm
of
the
waves.
The
seaward
side
of
Storm’s
End
perched
upon
a
pale
white
cliff,
the
chalky
stone
sloping
up
steeply
to
half
again
the
height
of
the
massive
curtain
wall.
A
mouth
yawned
in
the
cliff,
and
it
was
that
Davos
steered
for,
as
he
had
sixteen
years
before.
The
tunnel
opened
on
a
cavern
under
the
castle,
where
the
storm
lords
of
old
had
built
their
landing.

The
passage
was
navigable
only
during
high
tide,
and
was
never
less
than
treacherous,
but
his
smuggler’s
skills
had
not
deserted
him.
Davos
threaded
their
way
deftly
between
the
jagged
rocks
until
the
cave
mouth
loomed
up
before
them.
He
let
the
waves
carry
them
inside.
They
crashed
around
him,
slamming
the
boat
this
way
and
that
and
soaking
them
to
the
skin.
A
half-seen
finger
of
rock
came
rushing
up
out
of
the
gloom,
snarling
foam,
and
Davos
barely
kept
them
off
it
with
an
oar.

Then
they
were
past,
engulfed
in
darkness,
and
the
waters
smoothed.

The
little
boat
slowed
and
swirled.
The
sound
of
their
breathing
echoed
until
it
seemed
to
surround
them.
Davos
had
not
expected
the
blackness.
The
last
time,
torches
had
burned
all
along
the
tunnel,
and
the
eyes
of
starving
men
had
peered
down
through
the
murder
holes
in
the
ceiling.
The
portcullis
was
somewhere
ahead,
he
knew.
Davos
used
the
oars
to
slow
them,
and
they
drifted
against
it
almost
gently.

“This
is
as
far
as
we
go,
unless
you
have
a
man
inside
to
lift
the
gate
for
us.”
His
whispers
scurried
across
the
lapping
water
like
a
line
of
mice
on
soft
pink
feet.

“Have
we
passed
within
the
walls?”

“Yes.
Beneath.
But
we
can
go
no
farther.
The
portcullis
goes
all
the
way
to
the
bottom.
And
the
bars
are
too
closely
spaced
for
even
a
child
to
squeeze
through.”

There
was
no
answer
but
a
soft
rustling.
And
then
a
light
bloomed
amidst
the
darkness.

Davos
raised
a
hand
to
shield
his
eyes,
and
his
breath
caught
in
his
throat.
Melisandre
had
thrown
back
her
cowl
and
shrugged
out
of
the
smothering
robe.
Beneath,
she
was
naked,
and
huge
with
child.
Swollen
breasts
hung
heavy
against
her
chest,
and
her
belly
bulged
as
if
near
to
bursting.
“Gods
preserve
us,”
he
whispered,
and
heard
her
answering
laugh,
deep
and
throaty.
Her
eyes
were
hot
coals,
and
the
sweat
that
dappled
her
skin
seemed
to
glow
with
a
light
of
its
own.
Melisandre
shone.

Panting,
she
squatted
and
spread
her
legs.
Blood
ran
down
her
thighs,
black
as
ink.
Her
cry
might
have
been
agony
or
ecstasy
or
both.
And
Davos
saw
the
crown
of
the
child’s
head
push
its
way
out
of
her.
Two
arms
wriggled
free,
grasping,
black
fingers
coiling
around
Melisandre’s
straining
thighs,
pushing,
until
the
whole
of
the
shadow
slid
out
into
the
world
and
rose
taller
than
Davos,
tall
as
the
tunnel,
towering
above
the
boat.
He
had
only
an
instant
to
look
at
it
before
it
was
gone,
twisting
between
the
bars
of
the
portcullis
and
racing
across
the
surface
of
the
water,
but
that
instant
was
long
enough.

He
knew
that
shadow.
As
he
knew
the
man
who’d
cast
it.
=======
queen.

“Pycelle
swears
it
will
heal
clean.”
Robert
frowned.
“I
take
it
you
know
what
Catelyn
has
done?”

“I
do.”
Ned
took
a
small
swallow
of
wine.
“My
lady
wife
is
blameless,
Your
Grace.
All
she
did
she
did
at
my
command.”

“I
am
not
pleased,
Ned,”
Robert
grumbled.

“By
what
right
do
you
dare
lay
hands
on
my
blood?”
Cersei
demanded.
“Who
do
you
think
you
are?”

“The
Hand
of
the
King,”
Ned
told
her
with
icy
courtesy.
“Charged
by
your
own
lord
husband
to
keep
the
king’s
peace
and
enforce
the
king’s
justice.”

“You
were
the
Hand,”
Cersei
began,
“but
now—”

“Silence!”
the
king
roared.
“You
asked
him
a
question
and
he
answered
it.”
Cersei
subsided,
cold
with
anger,
and
Robert
turned
back
to
Ned.
“Keep
the
king’s
peace,
you
say.
Is
this
how
you
keep
my
peace,
Ned?
Seven
men
are
dead…”

“Eight,”
the
queen
corrected.
“Tregar
died
this
morning,
of
the
blow
Lord
Stark
gave
him.”

“Abductions
on
the
kingsroad
and
drunken
slaughter
in
my
streets,”
the
king
said.
“I
will
not
have
it,
Ned.”

“Catelyn
had
good
reason
for
taking
the
Imp—”

“I
said,
I
will
not
have
it!
To
hell
with
her
reasons.
You
will
command
her
to
release
the
dwarf
at
once,
and
you
will
make
your
peace
with
Jaime.”

“Three
of
my
men
were
butchered
before
my
eyes,
because
Jaime
Lannister
wished
to
chasten
me.
Am
I
to
forget
that?”

“My
brother
was
not
the
cause
of
this
quarrel,”
Cersei
told
the
king.
“Lord
Stark
was
returning
drunk
from
a
brothel.
His
men
attacked
Jaime
and
his
guards,
even
as
his
wife
attacked
Tyrion
on
the
kingsroad.”

“You
know
me
better
than
that,
Robert,”
Ned
said.
“Ask
Lord
Baelish
if
you
doubt
me.
He
was
there.”

“I’ve
talked
to
Littlefinger,”
Robert
said.
“He
claims
he
rode
off
to
bring
the
gold
cloaks
before
the
fighting
began,
but
he
admits
you
were
returning
from
some
whorehouse.”

“Some
whorehouse?
Damn
your
eyes,
Robert,
I
went
there
to
have
a
look
at
your
daughter!
Her
mother
has
named
her
Barra.
She
looks
like
that
first
girl
you
fathered,
when
we
were
boys
together
in
the
Vale.”
He
watched
the
queen
as
he
spoke;
her
face
was
a
mask,
still
and
pale,
betraying
nothing.

Robert
flushed.
“Barra,”
he
grumbled.
“Is
that
supposed
to
please
me?
Damn
the
girl.
I
thought
she
had
more
sense.”

“She
cannot
be
more
than
fifteen,
and
a
whore,
and
you
thought
she
had
sense?”
Ned
said,
incredulous.
His
leg
was
beginning
to
pain
him
sorely.
It
was
hard
to
keep
his
temper.
“The
fool
child
is
in
love
with
you,
Robert.”

The
king
glanced
at
Cersei.
“This
is
no
fit
subject
for
the
queen’s
ears.”

“Her
Grace
will
have
no
liking
for
anything
I
have
to
say,”
Ned
replied.
“I
am
told
the
Kingslayer
has
fled
the
city.
Give
me
leave
to
bring
him
back
to
justice.”

The
king
swirled
the
wine
in
his
cup,
brooding.
He
took
a
swallow.
“No,”
he
said.
“I
want
no
more
of
this.
Jaime
slew
three
of
your
men,
and
you
five
of
his.
Now
it
ends.”

“Is
that
your
notion
of
justice?”
Ned
flared.
“If
so,
I
am
pleased
that
I
am
no
longer
your
Hand.”

The
queen
looked
to
her
husband.
“If
any
man
had
dared
speak
to
a
Targaryen
as
he
has
spoken
to
you—”

“Do
you
take
me
for
Aerys?”
Robert
interrupted.

“I
took
you
for
a
king.
Jaime
and
Tyrion
are
your
own
brothers,
by
all
the
laws
of
marriage
and
the
bonds
we
share.
The
Starks
have
driven
off
the
one
and
seized
the
other.
This
man
dishonors
you
with
every
breath
he
takes,
and
yet
you
stand
there
meekly,
asking
if
his
leg
pains
him
and
would
he
like
some
wine.”

Robert’s
face
was
dark
with
anger.
“How
many
times
must
I
tell
you
to
hold
your
tongue,
woman?”

Cersei’s
face
was
a
study
in
contempt.
“What
a
jape
the
gods
have
made
of
us
two,”
she
said.
“By
all
rights,
you
ought
to
be
in
skirts
and
me
in
mail.”

Purple
with
rage,
the
king
lashed
out,
a
vicious
backhand
blow
to
the
side
of
the
head.
She
stumbled
against
the
table
and
fell
hard,
yet
Cersei
Lannister
did
not
cry
out.
Her
slender
fingers
brushed
her
cheek,
where
the
pale
smooth
skin
was
already
reddening.
On
the
morrow
the
bruise
would
cover
half
her
face.
“I
shall
wear
this
as
a
badge
of
honor,”
she
announced.

“Wear
it
in
silence,
or
I’ll
honor
you
again,”
Robert
vowed.
He
shouted
for
a
guard.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
stepped
into
the
room,
tall
and
somber
in
his
white
armor.
“The
queen
is
tired.
See
her
to
her
bedchamber.”
The
knight
helped
Cersei
to
her
feet
and
led
her
out
without
a
word.

Robert
reached
for
the
flagon
and
refilled
his
cup.
“You
see
what
she
does
to
me,
Ned.”
The
king
seated
himself,
cradling
his
wine
cup.
“My
loving
wife.
The
mother
of
my
children.”
The
rage
was
gone
from
him
now;
in
his
eyes
Ned
saw
something
sad
and
scared.
“I
should
not
have
hit
her.
That
was
not…
that
was
not
kingly.”
He
stared
down
at
his
hands,
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
they
were.
“I
was
always
strong…
no
one
could
stand
before
me,
no
one.
How
do
you
fight
someone
if
you
can’t
hit
them?”
Confused,
the
king
shook
his
head.
“Rhaegar…
Rhaegar
won,
damn
him.
I
killed
him,
Ned,
I
drove
the
spike
right
through
that
black
armor
into
his
black
heart,
and
he
died
at
my
feet.
They
made
up
songs
about
it.
Yet
somehow
he
still
won.
He
has
Lyanna
now,
and
I
have
her.”
The
king
drained
his
cup.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
Stark
said,
“we
must
talk…”

Robert
pressed
his
fingertips
against
his
temples.
“I
am
sick
unto
death
of
talk.
On
the
morrow
I’m
going
to
the
kingswood
to
hunt.
Whatever
you
have
to
say
can
wait
until
I
return.”

“If
the
gods
are
good,
I
shall
not
be
here
on
your
return.
You
commanded
me
to
return
to
Winterfell,
remember?”

Robert
stood
up,
grasping
one
of
the
bedposts
to
steady
himself.
“The
gods
are
seldom
good,
Ned.
Here,
this
is
yours.”
He
pulled
the
heavy
silver
hand
clasp
from
a
pocket
in
the
lining
of
his
cloak
and
tossed
it
on
the
bed.
“Like
it
or
not,
you
are
my
Hand,
damn
you.
I
forbid
you
to
leave.”

Ned
picked
up
the
silver
clasp.
He
was
being
given
no
choice,
it
seemed.
His
leg
throbbed,
and
he
felt
as
helpless
as
a
child.
“The
Targaryen
girl—”

The
king
groaned.
“Seven
hells,
don’t
start
with
her
again.
That’s
done,
I’ll
hear
no
more
of
it.”

“Why
would
you
want
me
as
your
Hand,
if
you
refuse
to
listen
to
my
counsel?”

“Why?”
Robert
laughed.
“Why
not?
Someone
has
to
rule
this
damnable
kingdom.
Put
on
the
badge,
Ned.
It
suits
you.
And
if
you
ever
throw
it
in
my
face
again,
I
swear
to
you,
I’ll
pin
the
damned
thing
on
Jaime
Lannister.”





CATELYN

The
eastern
sky
was
rose
and
gold
as
the
sun
broke
over
the
Vale
of
Arryn.
Catelyn
Stark
watched
the
light
spread,
her
hands
resting
on
the
delicate
carved
stone
of
the
balustrade
outside
her
window.
Below
her
the
world
turned
from
black
to
indigo
to
green
as
dawn
crept
across
fields
and
forests.
Pale
white
mists
rose
off
Alyssa’s
Tears,
where
the
ghost
waters
plunged
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
to
begin
their
long
tumble
down
the
face
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
Catelyn
could
feel
the
faint
touch
of
spray
on
her
face.

Alyssa
Arryn
had
seen
her
husband,
her
brothers,
and
all
her
children
slain,
and
yet
in
life
she
had
never
shed
a
tear.
So
in
death,
the
gods
had
decreed
that
she
would
know
no
rest
until
her
weeping
watered
the
black
earth
of
the
Vale,
where
the
men
she
had
loved
were
buried.
Alyssa
had
been
dead
six
thousand
years
now,
and
still
no
drop
of
the
torrent
had
ever
reached
the
valley
floor
far
below.
Catelyn
wondered
how
large
a
waterfall
her
own
tears
would
make
when
she
died.
“Tell
me
the
rest
of
it,”
she
said.

“The
Kingslayer
is
massing
a
host
at
Casterly
Rock,”
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
answered
from
the
room
behind
her.
“Your
brother
writes
that
he
has
sent
riders
to
the
Rock,
demanding
that
Lord
Tywin
proclaim
his
intent,
but
he
has
had
no
answer.
Edmure
has
commanded
Lord
Vance
and
Lord
Piper
to
guard
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth.
He
vows
to
you
that
he
will
yield
no
foot
of
Tully
land
without
first
watering
it
with
Lannister
blood.”

Catelyn
turned
away
from
the
sunrise.
Its
beauty
did
little
to
lighten
her
mood;
it
seemed
cruel
for
a
day
to
dawn
so
fair
and
end
so
foul
as
this
one
promised
to.
“Edmure
has
sent
riders
and
made
vows,”
she
said,
“but
Edmure
is
not
the
Lord
of
Riverrun.
What
of
my
lord
father?”

“The
message
made
no
mention
of
Lord
Hoster,
my
lady.”
Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
They
had
grown
in
white
as
snow
and
bristly
as
a
thornbush
while
he
was
recovering
from
his
wounds;
he
looked
almost
himself
again.

“My
father
would
not
have
given
the
defense
of
Riverrun
over
to
Edmure
unless
he
was
very
sick,”
she
said,
worried.
“I
should
have
been
woken
as
soon
as
this
bird
arrived.”

“Your
lady
sister
thought
it
better
to
let
you
sleep,
Maester
Colemon
told
me.”

“I
should
have
been
woken,”
she
insisted.

“The
maester
tells
me
your
sister
planned
to
speak
with
you
after
the
combat,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

“Then
she
still
plans
to
go
through
with
this
mummer’s
farce?”
Catelyn
grimaced.
“The
dwarf
has
played
her
like
a
set
of
pipes,
and
she
is
too
deaf
to
hear
the
tune.
Whatever
happens
this
morning,
Ser
Rodrik,
it
is
past
time
we
took
our
leave.
My
place
is
at
Winterfell
with
my
sons.
If
you
are
strong
enough
to
travel,
I
shall
ask
Lysa
for
an
escort
to
see
us
to
Gulltown.
We
can
take
ship
from
there.”

“Another
ship?”
Ser
Rodrik
looked
a
shade
green,
yet
he
managed
not
to
shudder.
“As
you
say,
my
lady.”

The
old
knight
waited
outside
her
door
as
Catelyn
summoned
the
servants
Lysa
had
given
her.
If
she
spoke
to
her
sister
before
the
duel,
perhaps
she
could
change
her
mind,
she
thought
as
they
dressed
her.
Lysa’s
policies
varied
with
her
moods,
and
her
moods
changed
hourly.
The
shy
girl
she
had
known
at
Riverrun
had
grown
into
a
woman
who
was
by
turns
proud,
fearful,
cruel,
dreamy,
reckless,
timid,
stubborn,
vain,
and,
above
all,
inconstant.

When
that
vile
turnkey
of
hers
had
come
crawling
to
tell
them
that
Tyrion
Lannister
wished
to
confess,
Catelyn
had
urged
Lysa
to
have
the
dwarf
brought
to
them
privately,
but
no,
nothing
would
do
but
that
her
sister
must
make
a
show
of
him
before
half
the
Vale.
And
now
this…

“Lannister
is
my
prisoner,”
she
told
Ser
Rodrik
as
they
descended
the
tower
stairs
and
made
their
way
through
the
Eyrie’s
cold
white
halls.
Catelyn
wore
plain
grey
wool
with
a
silvered
belt.
“My
sister
must
be
reminded
of
that.”

At
the
doors
to
Lysa’s
apartments,
they
met
her
uncle
storming
out.
“Going
to
join
the
fool’s
festival?”
Ser
Brynden
snapped.
“I’d
tell
you
to
slap
some
sense
into
your
sister,
if
I
thought
it
would
do
any
good,
but
you’d
only
bruise
your
hand.”

“There
was
a
bird
from
Riverrun,”
Catelyn
began,
“a
letter
from
Edmure…”

“I
know,
child.”
The
black
fish
that
fastened
his
cloak
was
Brynden’s
only
concession
to
ornament.
“I
had
to
hear
it
from
Maester
Colemon.
I
asked
your
sister
for
leave
to
take
a
thousand
seasoned
men
and
ride
for
Riverrun
with
all
haste.
Do
you
know
what
she
told
me?
The
Vale
cannot
spare
a
thousand
swords,
nor
even
one,
Uncle,
she
said.
You
are
the
Knight
of
the
Gate.
Your
place
is
here.”
A
gust
of
childish
laughter
drifted
through
the
open
doors
behind
him,
and
her
uncle
glanced
darkly
over
his
shoulder.
“Well,
I
told
her
she
could
bloody
well
find
herself
a
new
Knight
of
the
Gate.
Black
fish
or
no,
I
am
still
a
Tully.
I
shall
leave
for
Riverrun
by
evenfall.”

Catelyn
could
not
pretend
to
surprise.
“Alone?
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
you
will
never
survive
the
high
road.
Ser
Rodrik
and
I
are
returning
to
Winterfell.
Come
with
us,
Uncle.
I
will
give
you
your
thousand
men.
Riverrun
will
not
fight
alone.”

Brynden
thought
a
moment,
then
nodded
a
brusque
agreement.
“As
you
say.
It’s
the
long
way
home,
but
I’m
more
like
to
get
there.
I’ll
wait
for
you
below.”
He
went
striding
off,
his
cloak
swirling
behind
him.

Catelyn
exchanged
a
look
with
Ser
Rodrik.
They
went
through
the
doors
to
the
high,
nervous
sound
of
a
child’s
giggles.

Lysa’s
apartments
opened
over
a
small
garden,
a
circle
of
dirt
and
grass
planted
with
blue
flowers
and
ringed
on
all
sides
by
tall
white
towers.
The
builders
had
intended
it
as
a
godswood,
but
the
Eyrie
rested
on
the
hard
stone
of
the
mountain,
and
no
matter
how
much
soil
was
hauled
up
from
the
Vale,
they
could
not
get
a
weirwood
to
take
root
here.
So
the
Lords
of
the
Eyrie
planted
grass
and
scattered
statuary
amidst
low,
flowering
shrubs.
It
was
there
the
two
champions
would
meet
to
place
their
lives,
and
that
of
Tyrion
Lannister,
into
the
hands
of
the
gods.

Lysa,
freshly
scrubbed
and
garbed
in
cream
velvet
with
a
rope
of
sapphires
and
moonstones
around
her
milk-white
neck,
was
holding
court
on
the
terrace
overlooking
the
scene
of
the
combat,
surrounded
by
her
knights,
retainers,
and
lords
high
and
low.
Most
of
them
still
hoped
to
wed
her,
bed
her,
and
rule
the
Vale
of
Arryn
by
her
side.
From
what
Catelyn
had
seen
during
her
stay
at
the
Eyrie,
it
was
a
vain
hope.

A
wooden
platform
had
been
built
to
elevate
Robert’s
chair;
there
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
sat,
giggling
and
clapping
his
hands
as
a
humpbacked
puppeteer
in
blue-and-white
motley
made
two
wooden
knights
hack
and
slash
at
each
other.
Pitchers
of
thick
cream
and
baskets
of
blackberries
had
been
set
out,
and
the
guests
were
sipping
a
sweet
orange-scented
wine
from
engraved
silver
cups.
A
fool’s
festival,
Brynden
had
called
it,
and
small
wonder.

Across
the
terrace,
Lysa
laughed
gaily
at
some
jest
of
Lord
Hunter’s,
and
nibbled
a
blackberry
from
the
point
of
Ser
Lyn
Corbray’s
dagger.
They
were
the
suitors
who
stood
highest
in
Lysa’s
favor…
today,
at
least.
Catelyn
would
have
been
hard-pressed
to
say
which
man
was
more
unsuitable.
Eon
Hunter
was
even
older
than
Jon
Arryn
had
been,
half-crippled
by
gout,
and
cursed
with
three
quarrelsome
sons,
each
more
grasping
than
the
last.
Ser
Lyn
was
a
different
sort
of
folly;
lean
and
handsome,
heir
to
an
ancient
but
impoverished
house,
but
vain,
reckless,
hot-tempered…
and,
it
was
whispered,
notoriously
uninterested
in
the
intimate
charms
of
women.

When
Lysa
espied
Catelyn,
she
welcomed
her
with
a
sisterly
embrace
and
a
moist
kiss
on
the
cheek.
“Isn’t
it
a
lovely
morning?
The
gods
are
smiling
on
us.
Do
try
a
cup
of
the
wine,
sweet
sister.
Lord
Hunter
was
kind
enough
to
send
for
it,
from
his
own
cellars.”

“Thank
you,
no.
Lysa,
we
must
talk.”

“After,”
her
sister
promised,
already
beginning
to
turn
away
from
her.

“Now.”
Catelyn
spoke
more
loudly
than
she’d
intended.
Men
were
turning
to
look.
“Lysa,
you
cannot
mean
to
go
ahead
with
this
folly.
Alive,
the
Imp
has
value.
Dead,
he
is
only
food
for
crows.
And
if
his
champion
should
prevail
here—”

“Small
chance
of
that,
my
lady,”
Lord
Hunter
assured
her,
patting
her
shoulder
with
a
liver-spotted
hand.
“Ser
Vardis
is
a
doughty
fighter.
He
will
make
short
work
of
the
sellsword.”

“Will
he,
my
lord?”
Catelyn
said
coolly.
“I
wonder.”
She
had
seen
Bronn
fight
on
the
high
road;
it
was
no
accident
that
he
had
survived
the
journey
while
other
men
had
died.
He
moved
like
a
panther,
and
that
ugly
sword
of
his
seemed
a
part
of
his
arm.

Lysa’s
suitors
were
gathering
around
them
like
bees
round
a
blossom.
“Women
understand
little
of
these
things,”
Ser
Morton
Waynwood
said.
“Ser
Vardis
is
a
knight,
sweet
lady.
This
other
fellow,
well,
his
sort
are
all
cowards
at
heart.
Useful
enough
in
a
battle,
with
thousands
of
their
fellows
around
them,
but
stand
them
up
alone
and
the
manhood
leaks
right
out
of
them.”

“Say
you
have
the
truth
of
it,
then,”
Catelyn
said
with
a
courtesy
that
made
her
mouth
ache.
“What
will
we
gain
by
the
dwarf’s
death?
Do
you
imagine
that
Jaime
will
care
a
fig
that
we
gave
his
brother
a
trial
before
we
flung
him
off
a
mountain?”

“Behead
the
man,”
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
suggested.
“When
the
Kingslayer
receives
the
Imp’s
head,
it
will
be
a
warning
to
him,”

Lysa
gave
an
impatient
shake
of
her
waist-long
auburn
hair.
“Lord
Robert
wants
to
see
him
fly,”
she
said,
as
if
that
settled
the
matter.
“And
the
Imp
has
only
himself
to
blame.
It
was
he
who
demanded
a
trial
by
combat.”

“Lady
Lysa
had
no
honorable
way
to
deny
him,
even
if
she’d
wished
to,”
Lord
Hunter
intoned
ponderously.

Ignoring
them
all,
Catelyn
turned
all
her
force
on
her
sister.
“I
remind
you,
Tyrion
Lannister
is
my
prisoner.”

“And
I
remind
you,
the
dwarf
murdered
my
lord
husband!”
Her
voice
rose.
“He
poisoned
the
Hand
of
the
King
and
left
my
sweet
baby
fatherless,
and
now
I
mean
to
see
him
pay!”
Whirling,
her
skirts
swinging
around
her,
Lysa
stalked
across
the
terrace.
Ser
Lyn
and
Ser
Morton
and
the
other
suitors
excused
themselves
with
cool
nods
and
trailed
after
her.

“Do
you
think
he
did?”
Ser
Rodrik
asked
her
quietly
when
they
were
alone
again.
“Murder
Lord
Jon,
that
is?
The
Imp
still
denies
it,
and
most
fiercely…”

“I
believe
the
Lannisters
murdered
Lord
Arryn,”
Catelyn
replied,
“but
whether
it
was
Tyrion,
or
Ser
Jaime,
or
the
queen,
or
all
of
them
together,
I
could
not
begin
to
say.”
Lysa
had
named
Cersei
in
the
letter
she
had
sent
to
Winterfell,
but
now
she
seemed
certain
that
Tyrion
was
the
killer…
perhaps
because
the
dwarf
was
here,
while
the
queen
was
safe
behind
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
hundreds
of
leagues
to
the
south.
Catelyn
almost
wished
she
had
burned
her
sister’s
letter
before
reading
it.

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
“Poison,
well…
that
could
be
the
dwarf’s
work,
true
enough.
Or
Cersei’s.
It’s
said
poison
is
a
woman’s
weapon,
begging
your
pardons,
my
lady.
The
Kingslayer,
now…
I
have
no
great
liking
for
the
man,
but
he’s
not
the
sort.
Too
fond
of
the
sight
of
blood
on
that
golden
sword
of
his.
Was
it
poison,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
frowned,
vaguely
uneasy.
“How
else
could
they
make
it
look
a
natural
death?”
Behind
her,
Lord
Robert
shrieked
with
delight
as
one
of
the
puppet
knights
sliced
the
other
in
half,
spilling
a
flood
of
red
sawdust
onto
the
terrace.
She
glanced
at
her
nephew
and
sighed.
“The
boy
is
utterly
without
discipline.
He
will
never
be
strong
enough
to
rule
unless
he
is
taken
away
from
his
mother
for
a
time.”

“His
lord
father
agreed
with
you,”
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow.
She
turned
to
behold
Maester
Colemon,
a
cup
of
wine
in
his
hand.
“He
was
planning
to
send
the
boy
to
Dragonstone
for
fostering,
you
know…
oh,
but
I’m
speaking
out
of
turn.”
The
apple
of
his
throat
bobbed
anxiously
beneath
the
loose
maester’s
chain.
“I
fear
I’ve
had
too
much
of
Lord
Hunter’s
excellent
wine.
The
prospect
of
bloodshed
has
my
nerves
all
a-fray…”

“You
are
mistaken,
Maester,”
Catelyn
said.
“It
was
Casterly
Rock,
not
Dragonstone,
and
those
arrangements
were
made
after
the
Hand’s
death,
without
my
sister’s
consent.”

The
maester’s
head
jerked
so
vigorously
at
the
end
of
his
absurdly
long
neck
that
he
looked
half
a
puppet
himself.
“No,
begging
your
forgiveness,
my
lady,
but
it
was
Lord
Jon
who—”

A
bell
tolled
loudly
below
them.
High
lords
and
serving
girls
alike
broke
off
what
they
were
doing
and
moved
to
the
balustrade.
Below,
two
guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
led
forth
Tyrion
Lannister.
The
Eyrie’s
plump
septon
escorted
him
to
the
statue
in
the
center
of
the
garden,
a
weeping
woman
carved
in
veined
white
marble,
no
doubt
meant
to
be
Alyssa.

“The
bad
little
man,”
Lord
Robert
said,
giggling.
“Mother,
can
I
make
him
fly?
I
want
to
see
him
fly.”

“Later,
my
sweet
baby,”
Lysa
promised
him.

“Trial
first,”
drawled
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
“then
execution.”

A
moment
later
the
two
champions
appeared
from
opposite
sides
of
the
garden.
The
knight
was
attended
by
two
young
squires,
the
sellsword
by
the
Eyrie’s
master-at-arms.

Ser
Vardis
Egen
was
steel
from
head
to
heel,
encased
in
heavy
plate
armor
over
mail
and
padded
surcoat.
Large
circular
rondels,
enameled
cream-and-blue
in
the
moon-and-falcon
sigil
of
House
Arryn,
protected
the
vulnerable
juncture
of
arm
and
breast.
A
skirt
of
lobstered
metal
covered
him
from
waist
to
midthigh,
while
a
solid
gorget
encircled
his
throat.
Falcon’s
wings
sprouted
from
the
temples
of
his
helm,
and
his
visor
was
a
pointed
metal
beak
with
a
narrow
slit
for
vision.

Bronn
was
so
lightly
armored
he
looked
almost
naked
beside
the
knight.
He
wore
only
a
shirt
of
black
oiled
ringmail
over
boiled
leather,
a
round
steel
halfhelm
with
a
noseguard,
and
a
mail
coif.
High
leather
boots
with
steel
shinguards
gave
some
protection
to
his
legs,
and
discs
of
black
iron
were
sewn
into
the
fingers
of
his
gloves.
Yet
Catelyn
noted
that
the
sellsword
stood
half
a
hand
taller
than
his
foe,
with
a
longer
reach…
and
Bronn
was
fifteen
years
younger,
if
she
was
any
judge.

They
knelt
in
the
grass
beneath
the
weeping
woman,
facing
each
other,
with
Lannister
between
them.
The
septon
removed
a
faceted
crystal
sphere
from
the
soft
cloth
bag
at
his
waist.
He
lifted
it
high
above
his
head,
and
the
light
shattered.
Rainbows
danced
across
the
Imp’s
face.
In
a
high,
solemn,
singsong
voice,
the
septon
asked
the
gods
to
look
down
and
bear
witness,
to
find
the
truth
in
this
man’s
soul,
to
grant
him
life
and
freedom
if
he
was
innocent,
death
if
he
was
guilty.
His
voice
echoed
off
the
surrounding
towers.

When
the
last
echo
had
died
away,
the
septon
lowered
his
crystal
and
made
a
hasty
departure.
Tyrion
leaned
over
and
whispered
something
in
Bronn’s
ear
before
the
guardsmen
led
him
away.
The
sellsword
rose
laughing
and
brushed
a
blade
of
grass
from
his
knee.

Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale,
was
fidgeting
impatiently
in
his
elevated
chair.
“When
are
they
going
to
fight?”
he
asked
plaintively.

Ser
Vardis
was
helped
back
to
his
feet
by
one
of
his
squires.
The
other
brought
him
a
triangular
shield
almost
four
feet
tall,
heavy
oak
dotted
with
iron
studs.
They
strapped
it
to
his
left
forearm.
When
Lysa’s
master-at-arms
offered
Bronn
a
similar
shield,
the
sellsword
spat
and
waved
it
away.
Three
days
growth
of
coarse
black
beard
covered
his
jaw
and
cheeks,
but
if
he
did
not
shave
it
was
not
for
want
of
a
razor;
the
edge
of
his
sword
had
the
dangerous
glimmer
of
steel
that
had
been
honed
every
day
for
hours,
until
it
was
too
sharp
to
touch.

Ser
Vardis
held
out
a
gauntleted
hand,
and
his
squire
placed
a
handsome
double-edged
longsword
in
his
grasp.
The
blade
was
engraved
with
a
delicate
silver
tracery
of
a
mountain
sky;
its
pommel
was
a
falcon’s
head,
its
crossguard
fashioned
into
the
shape
of
wings.
“I
had
that
sword
crafted
for
Jon
in
King’s
Landing,”
Lysa
told
her
guests
proudly
as
they
watched
Ser
Vardis
try
a
practice
cut.
“He
wore
it
whenever
he
sat
the
Iron
Throne
in
King
Robert’s
place.
Isn’t
it
a
lovely
thing?
I
thought
it
only
fitting
that
our
champion
avenge
Jon
with
his
own
blade.”

The
engraved
silver
blade
was
beautiful
beyond
a
doubt,
but
it
seemed
to
Catelyn
that
Ser
Vardis
might
have
been
more
comfortable
with
his
own
sword.
Yet
she
said
nothing;
she
was
weary
of
futile
arguments
with
her
sister.

“Make
them
fight!”
Lord
Robert
called
out.

Ser
Vardis
faced
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
lifted
his
sword
in
salute.
“For
the
Eyrie
and
the
Vale!”

Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
seated
on
a
balcony
across
the
garden,
flanked
by
his
guards.
It
was
to
him
that
Bronn
turned
with
a
cursory
salute.

“They
await
your
command,”
Lady
Lysa
said
to
her
lord
son.

“Fight!”
the
boy
screamed,
his
arms
trembling
as
they
clutched
at
his
chair.

Ser
Vardis
swiveled,
bringing
up
his
heavy
shield.
Bronn
turned
to
face
him.
Their
swords
rang
together,
once,
twice,
a
testing.
The
sellsword
backed
off
a
step.
The
knight
came
after,
holding
his
shield
before
him.
He
tried
a
slash,
but
Bronn
jerked
back,
just
out
of
reach,
and
the
silver
blade
cut
only
air.
Bronn
circled
to
his
right.
Ser
Vardis
turned
to
follow,
keeping
his
shield
between
them.
The
knight
pressed
forward,
placing
each
foot
carefully
on
the
uneven
ground.
The
sellsword
gave
way,
a
faint
smile
playing
over
his
lips.
Ser
Vardis
attacked,
slashing,
but
Bronn
leapt
away
from
him,
hopping
lightly
over
a
low,
moss-covered
stone.
Now
the
sellsword
circled
left,
away
from
the
shield,
toward
the
knight’s
unprotected
side.
Ser
Vardis
tried
a
hack
at
his
legs,
but
he
did
not
have
the
reach.
Bronn
danced
farther
to
his
left.
Ser
Vardis
turned
in
place.

“The
man
is
craven,”
Lord
Hunter
declared.
“Stand
and
fight,
coward!”
Other
voices
echoed
the
sentiment.

Catelyn
looked
to
Ser
Rodrik.
Her
master-at-arms
gave
a
curt
shake
of
his
head.
“He
wants
to
make
Ser
Vardis
chase
him.
The
weight
of
armor
and
shield
will
tire
even
the
strongest
man.”

She
had
seen
men
practice
at
their
swordplay
near
every
day
of
her
life,
had
viewed
half
a
hundred
tourneys
in
her
time,
but
this
was
something
different
and
deadlier:
a
dance
where
the
smallest
misstep
meant
death.
And
as
she
watched,
the
memory
of
another
duel
in
another
time
came
back
to
Catelyn
Stark,
as
vivid
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday.

They
met
in
the
lower
bailey
of
Riverrun.
When
Brandon
saw
that
Petyr
wore
only
helm
and
breastplate
and
mail,
he
took
off
most
of
his
armor.
Petyr
had
begged
her
for
a
favor
he
might
wear,
but
she
had
turned
him
away.
Her
lord
father
promised
her
to
Brandon
Stark,
and
so
it
was
to
him
that
she
gave
her
token,
a
pale
blue
handscarf
she
had
embroidered
with
the
leaping
trout
of
Riverrun.
As
she
pressed
it
into
his
hand,
she
pleaded
with
him.
“He
is
only
a
foolish
boy,
but
I
have
loved
him
like
a
brother.
It
would
grieve
me
to
see
him
die.”
And
her
betrothed
looked
at
her
with
the
cool
grey
eyes
of
a
Stark
and
promised
to
spare
the
boy
who
loved
her.

That
fight
was
over
almost
as
soon
as
it
began.
Brandon
was
a
man
grown,
and
he
drove
Littlefinger
all
the
way
across
the
bailey
and
down
the
water
stair,
raining
steel
on
him
with
every
step,
until
the
boy
was
staggering
and
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds.
“Yield!”
he
called,
more
than
once,
but
Petyr
would
only
shake
his
head
and
fight
on,
grimly.
When
the
river
was
lapping
at
their
ankles,
Brandon
finally
ended
it,
with
a
brutal
backhand
cut
that
bit
through
Petyr’s
rings
and
leather
into
the
soft
flesh
below
the
ribs,
so
deep
that
Catelyn
was
certain
that
the
wound
was
mortal.
He
looked
at
her
as
he
fell
and
murmured
“Cat”
as
the
bright
blood
came
flowing
out
between
his
mailed
fingers.
She
thought
she
had
forgotten
that.

That
was
the
last
time
she
had
seen
his
face…
until
the
day
she
was
brought
before
him
in
King’s
Landing.

A
fortnight
passed
before
Littlefinger
was
strong
enough
to
leave
Riverrun,
but
her
lord
father
forbade
her
to
visit
him
in
the
tower
where
he
lay
abed.
Lysa
helped
their
maester
nurse
him;
she
had
been
softer
and
shyer
in
those
days.
Edmure
had
called
on
him
as
well,
but
Petyr
had
sent
him
away.
Her
brother
had
acted
as
Brandon’s
squire
at
the
duel,
and
Littlefinger
would
not
forgive
that.
As
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
to
be
moved,
Lord
Hoster
Tully
sent
Petyr
Baelish
away
in
a
closed
litter,
to
finish
his
healing
on
the
Fingers,
upon
the
windswept
jut
of
rock
where
he’d
been
born.

The
ringing
clash
of
steel
on
steel
jarred
Catelyn
back
to
the
present.
Ser
Vardis
was
coming
hard
at
Bronn,
driving
into
him
with
shield
and
sword.
The
sellsword
scrambled
backward,
checking
each
blow,
stepping
lithely
over
rock
and
root,
his
eyes
never
leaving
his
foe.
He
was
quicker,
Catelyn
saw;
the
knight’s
silvered
sword
never
came
near
to
touching
him,
but
his
own
ugly
grey
blade
hacked
a
notch
from
Ser
Vardis’s
shoulder
plate.

The
brief
flurry
of
fighting
ended
as
swiftly
as
it
had
begun
when
Bronn
sidestepped
and
slid
behind
the
statue
of
the
weeping
woman.
Ser
Vardis
lunged
at
where
he
had
been,
striking
a
spark
off
the
pale
marble
of
Alyssa’s
thigh.

“They’re
not
fighting
good,
Mother,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
complained.
“I
want
them
to
fight.”

“They
will,
sweet
baby,”
his
mother
soothed
him.
“The
sellsword
can’t
run
all
day.”

Some
of
the
lords
on
Lysa’s
terrace
were
making
wry
jests
as
they
refilled
their
wine
cups,
but
across
the
garden,
Tyrion
Lannister’s
mismatched
eyes
watched
the
champions
dance
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
the
world.

Bronn
came
out
from
behind
the
statue
hard
and
fast,
still
moving
left,
aiming
a
two-handed
cut
at
the
knight’s
unshielded
right
side.
Ser
Vardis
blocked,
but
clumsily,
and
the
sellsword’s
blade
flashed
upward
at
his
head.
Metal
rang,
and
a
falcon’s
wing
collapsed
with
a
crunch.
Ser
Vardis
took
a
half
step
back
to
brace
himself,
raised
his
shield.
Oak
chips
flew
as
Bronn’s
sword
hacked
at
the
wooden
wall.
The
sellsword
stepped
left
again,
away
from
the
shield,
and
caught
Ser
Vardis
across
the
stomach,
the
razor
edge
of
his
blade
leaving
a
bright
gash
when
it
bit
into
the
knight’s
plate.

Ser
Vardis
drove
forward
off
his
back
foot,
his
own
silver
blade
descending
in
a
savage
arc.
Bronn
slammed
it
aside
and
danced
away.
The
knight
crashed
into
the
weeping
woman,
rocking
her
on
her
plinth.
Staggered,
he
stepped
backward,
his
head
turning
this
way
and
that
as
he
searched
for
his
foe.
The
slit
visor
of
his
helm
narrowed
his
vision.

“Behind
you,
ser!”
Lord
Hunter
shouted,
too
late.
Bronn
brought
his
sword
down
with
both
hands,
catching
Ser
Vardis
in
the
elbow
of
his
sword
arm.
The
thin
lobstered
metal
that
protected
the
joint
crunched.
The
knight
grunted,
turning,
wrenching
his
weapon
up.
This
time
Bronn
stood
his
ground.
The
swords
flew
at
each
other,
and
their
steel
song
filled
the
garden
and
rang
off
the
white
towers
of
the
Eyrie.

“Ser
Vardis
is
hurt,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
his
voice
grave.

Catelyn
did
not
need
to
be
told;
she
had
eyes,
she
could
see
the
bright
finger
of
blood
running
along
the
knight’s
forearm,
the
wetness
inside
the
elbow
joint.
Every
parry
was
a
little
slower
and
a
little
lower
than
the
one
before.
Ser
Vardis
turned
his
side
to
his
foe,
trying
to
use
his
shield
to
block
instead,
but
Bronn
slid
around
him,
quick
as
a
cat.
The
sellsword
seemed
to
be
getting
stronger.
His
cuts
were
leaving
their
marks
now.
Deep
shiny
gashes
gleamed
all
over
the
knight’s
armor,
on
his
right
thigh,
his
beaked
visor,
crossing
on
his
breastplate,
a
long
one
along
the
front
of
his
gorget.
The
moon-and-falcon
rondel
over
Ser
Vardis’s
right
arm
was
sheared
clean
in
half,
hanging
by
its
strap.
They
could
hear
his
labored
breath,
rattling
through
the
air
holes
in
his
visor.

Blind
with
arrogance
as
they
were,
even
the
knights
and
lords
of
the
Vale
could
see
what
was
happening
below
them,
yet
her
sister
could
not.
“Enough,
Ser
Vardis!”
Lady
Lysa
called
down.
“Finish
him
now,
my
baby
is
growing
tired.”

And
it
must
be
said
of
Ser
Vardis
Egen
that
he
was
true
to
his
lady’s
command,
even
to
the
last.
One
moment
he
was
reeling
backward,
half-crouched
behind
his
scarred
shield;
the
next
he
charged.
The
sudden
bull
rush
caught
Bronn
off
balance.
Ser
Vardis
crashed
into
him
and
slammed
the
lip
of
his
shield
into
the
sellsword’s
face.
Almost,
almost,
Bronn
lost
his
feet…
he
staggered
back,
tripped
over
a
rock,
and
caught
hold
of
the
weeping
woman
to
keep
his
balance.
Throwing
aside
his
shield,
Ser
Vardis
lurched
after
him,
using
both
hands
to
raise
his
sword.
His
right
arm
was
blood
from
elbow
to
fingers
now,
yet
his
last
desperate
blow
would
have
opened
Bronn
from
neck
to
navel…
if
the
sellsword
had
stood
to
receive
it.

But
Bronn
jerked
back.
Jon
Arryn’s
beautiful
engraved
silver
sword
glanced
off
the
marble
elbow
of
the
weeping
woman
and
snapped
clean
a
third
of
the
way
up
the
blade.
Bronn
put
his
shoulder
into
the
statue’s
back.
The
weathered
likeness
of
Alyssa
Arryn
tottered
and
fell
with
a
great
crash,
and
Ser
Vardis
Egen
went
down
beneath
her.

Bronn
was
on
him
in
a
heartbeat,
kicking
what
was
left
of
his
shattered
rondel
aside
to
expose
the
weak
spot
between
arm
and
breastplate.
Ser
Vardis
was
lying
on
his
side,
pinned
beneath
the
broken
torso
of
the
weeping
woman.
Catelyn
heard
the
knight
groan
as
the
sellsword
lifted
his
blade
with
both
hands
and
drove
it
down
and
in
with
all
his
weight
behind
it,
under
the
arm
and
through
the
ribs.
Ser
Vardis
Egen
shuddered
and
lay
still.

Silence
hung
over
the
Eyrie.
Bronn
yanked
off
his
halfhelm
and
let
it
fall
to
the
grass.
His
lip
was
smashed
and
bloody
where
the
shield
had
caught
him,
and
his
coal-black
hair
was
soaked
with
sweat.
He
spit
out
a
broken
tooth.

“Is
it
over,
Mother?”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
asked.

No,
Catelyn
wanted
to
tell
him,
it’s
only
now
beginning.

“Yes,”
Lysa
said
glumly,
her
voice
as
cold
and
dead
as
the
captain
of
her
guard.

“Can
I
make
the
little
man
fly
now?”

Across
the
garden,
Tyrion
Lannister
got
to
his
feet.
“Not
this
little
man,”
he
said.
“This
little
man
is
going
down
in
the
turnip
hoist,
thank
you
very
much.”

“You
presume—”
Lysa
began.

“I
presume
that
House
Arryn
remembers
its
own
words,”
the
Imp
said.
“As
High
as
Honor.”

“You
promised
I
could
make
him
fly,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
screamed
at
his
mother.
He
began
to
shake.

Lady
Lysa’s
face
was
flushed
with
fury.
“The
gods
have
seen
fit
to
proclaim
him
innocent,
child.
We
have
no
choice
but
to
free
him.”
She
lifted
her
voice.
“Guards.
Take
my
lord
of
Lannister
and
his…
creature
here
out
of
my
sight.
Escort
them
to
the
Bloody
Gate
and
set
them
free.
See
that
they
have
horses
and
supplies
sufficient
to
reach
the
Trident,
and
make
certain
all
their
goods
and
weapons
are
returned
to
them.
They
shall
need
them
on
the
high
road.”

“The
high
road,”
Tyrion
Lannister
said.
Lysa
allowed
herself
a
faint,
satisfied
smile.
It
was
another
sort
of
death
sentence,
Catelyn
realized.
Tyrion
Lannister
must
know
that
as
well.
Yet
the
dwarf
favored
Lady
Arryn
with
a
mocking
bow.
“As
you
command,
my
lady,”
he
said.
“I
believe
we
know
the
way.”





JON

“You
are
as
hopeless
as
any
boys
I
have
ever
trained,”
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
announced
when
they
had
all
assembled
in
the
yard.
“Your
hands
were
made
for
manure
shovels,
not
for
swords,
and
if
it
were
up
to
me,
the
lot
of
you
would
be
set
to
herding
swine.
But
last
night
I
was
told
that
Gueren
is
marching
five
new
boys
up
the
kingsroad.
One
or
two
may
even
be
worth
the
price
of
piss.
To
make
room
for
them,
I
have
decided
to
pass
eight
of
you
on
to
the
Lord
Commander
to
do
with
as
he
will.”
He
called
out
the
names
one
by
one.
“Toad.
Stone
Head.
Aurochs.
Lover.
Pimple.
Monkey.
Ser
Loon.”
Last,
he
looked
at
Jon.
“And
the
Bastard.”

Pyp
let
fly
a
whoop
and
thrust
his
sword
into
the
air.
Ser
Alliser
fixed
him
with
a
reptile
stare.
“They
will
call
you
men
of
Night’s
Watch
now,
but
you
are
bigger
fools
than
the
Mummer’s
Monkey
here
if
you
believe
that.
You
are
boys
still,
green
and
stinking
of
summer,
and
when
the
winter
comes
you
will
die
like
flies.”
And
with
that,
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
took
his
leave
of
them.

The
other
boys
gathered
round
the
eight
who
had
been
named,
laughing
and
cursing
and
offering
congratulations.
Halder
smacked
Toad
on
the
butt
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
shouted,
“Toad,
of
the
Night’s
Watch!”
Yelling
that
a
black
brother
needed
a
horse,
Pyp
leapt
onto
Grenn’s
shoulders,
and
they
tumbled
to
the
ground,
rolling
and
punching
and
hooting.
Dareon
dashed
inside
the
armory
and
returned
with
a
skin
of
sour
red.
As
they
passed
the
wine
from
hand
to
hand,
grinning
like
fools,
Jon
noticed
Samwell
Tarly
standing
by
himself
beneath
a
bare
dead
tree
in
the
corner
of
the
yard.
Jon
offered
him
the
skin.
“A
swallow
of
wine?”

Sam
shook
his
head.
“No
thank
you,
Jon.”

“Are
you
well?”

“Very
well,
truly,”
the
fat
boy
lied.
“I
am
so
happy
for
you
all.”
His
round
face
quivered
as
he
forced
a
smile.
“You
will
be
First
Ranger
someday,
just
as
your
uncle
was.”

“Is,”
Jon
corrected.
He
would
not
accept
that
Benjen
Stark
was
dead.
Before
he
could
say
more,
Haider
cried,
“Here,
you
planning
to
drink
that
all
yourself?”
Pyp
snatched
the
skin
from
his
hand
and
danced
away,
laughing.
While
Grenn
seized
his
arm,
Pyp
gave
the
skin
a
squeeze,
and
a
thin
stream
of
red
squirted
Jon
in
the
face.
Haider
howled
in
protest
at
the
waste
of
good
wine.
Jon
sputtered
and
struggled.
Matthar
and
Jeren
climbed
the
wall
and
began
pelting
them
all
with
snowballs.

By
the
time
he
wrenched
free,
with
snow
in
his
hair
and
wine
stains
on
his
surcoat,
Samwell
Tarly
had
gone.

That
night,
Three-Finger
Hobb
cooked
the
boys
a
special
meal
to
mark
the
occasion.
When
Jon
arrived
at
the
common
hall,
the
Lord
Steward
himself
led
him
to
the
bench
near
the
fire.
The
older
men
clapped
him
on
the
arm
in
passing.
The
eight
soon-to-be
brothers
feasted
on
rack
of
lamb
baked
in
a
crust
of
garlic
and
herbs,
garnished
with
sprigs
of
mint,
and
surrounded
by
mashed
yellow
turnips
swimming
in
butter.
“From
the
Lord
Commander’s
own
table,”
Bowen
Marsh
told
them.
There
were
salads
of
spinach
and
chickpeas
and
turnip
greens,
and
afterward
bowls
of
iced
blueberries
and
sweet
cream.

“Do
you
think
they’ll
keep
us
together?”
Pyp
wondered
as
they
gorged
themselves
happily.

Toad
made
a
face.
“I
hope
not.
I’m
sick
of
looking
at
those
ears
of
yours.”

“Ho,”
said
Pyp.
“Listen
to
the
crow
call
the
raven
black.
You’re
certain
to
be
a
ranger,
Toad.
They’ll
want
you
as
far
from
the
castle
as
they
can.
If
Mance
Rayder
attacks,
lift
your
visor
and
show
your
face,
and
he’ll
run
off
screaming.”

Everyone
laughed
but
Grenn.
“I
hope
I’m
a
ranger.”

“You
and
everyone
else,”
said
Matthar.
Every
man
who
wore
the
black
walked
the
Wall,
and
every
man
was
expected
to
take
up
steel
in
its
defense,
but
the
rangers
were
the
true
fighting
heart
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
It
was
they
who
dared
ride
beyond
the
Wall,
sweeping
through
the
haunted
forest
and
the
icy
mountain
heights
west
of
the
Shadow
Tower,
fighting
wildlings
and
giants
and
monstrous
snow
bears.

“Not
everyone,”
said
Halder.
“It’s
the
builders
for
me.
What
use
would
rangers
be
if
the
Wall
fell
down?”

The
order
of
builders
provided
the
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
keeps
and
towers,
the
miners
to
dig
tunnels
and
crush
stone
for
roads
and
footpaths,
the
woodsmen
to
clear
away
new
growth
wherever
the
forest
pressed
too
close
to
the
Wall.
Once,
it
was
said,
they
had
quarried
immense
blocks
of
ice
from
frozen
lakes
deep
in
the
haunted
forest,
dragging
them
south
on
sledges
so
the
Wall
might
be
raised
ever
higher.
Those
days
were
centuries
gone,
however;
now,
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
ride
the
Wall
from
Eastwatch
to
the
Shadow
Tower,
watching
for
cracks
or
signs
of
melt
and
making
what
repairs
they
could.

“The
Old
Bear’s
no
fool,”
Dareon
observed.
“You’re
certain
to
be
a
builder,
and
Jon’s
certain
to
be
a
ranger.
He’s
the
best
sword
and
the
best
rider
among
us,
and
his
uncle
was
the
First
before
he…”
His
voice
trailed
off
awkwardly
as
he
realized
what
he
had
almost
said.

“Benjen
Stark
is
still
First
Ranger,”
Jon
Snow
told
him,
toying
with
his
bowl
of
blueberries.
The
rest
might
have
given
up
all
hope
of
his
uncle’s
safe
return,
but
not
him.
He
pushed
away
the
berries,
scarcely
touched,
and
rose
from
the
bench.

“Aren’t
you
going
to
eat
those?”
Toad
asked.

“They’re
yours.”
Jon
had
hardly
tasted
Hobb’s
great
feast.
“I
could
not
eat
another
bite.”
He
took
his
cloak
from
its
hook
near
the
door
and
shouldered
his
way
out.

Pyp
followed
him.
“Jon,
what
is
it?”

“Sam,”
he
admitted.
“He
was
not
at
table
tonight.”

“It’s
not
like
him
to
miss
a
meal,”
Pyp
said
thoughtfully.
“Do
you
suppose
he’s
taken
ill?”

“He’s
frightened.
We’re
leaving
him.”
He
remembered
the
day
he
had
left
Winterfell,
all
the
bittersweet
farewells;
Bran
lying
broken,
Robb
with
snow
in
his
hair,
Arya
raining
kisses
on
him
after
he’d
given
her
Needle.
“Once
we
say
our
words,
we’ll
all
have
duties
to
attend
to.
Some
of
us
may
be
sent
away,
to
Eastwatch
or
the
Shadow
Tower.
Sam
will
remain
in
training,
with
the
likes
of
Rast
and
Cuger
and
these
new
boys
who
are
coming
up
the
kingsroad.
Gods
only
know
what
they’ll
be
like,
but
you
can
bet
Ser
Alliser
will
send
them
against
him,
first
chance
he
gets.”

Pyp
made
a
grimace.
“You
did
all
you
could.”

“All
we
could
wasn’t
enough,”
Jon
said.

A
deep
restlessness
was
on
him
as
he
went
back
to
Hardin’s
Tower
for
Ghost.
The
direwolf
walked
beside
him
to
the
stables.
Some
of
the
more
skittish
horses
kicked
at
their
stalls
and
laid
back
their
ears
as
they
entered.
Jon
saddled
his
mare,
mounted,
and
rode
out
from
Castle
Black,
south
across
the
moonlit
night.
Ghost
raced
ahead
of
him,
flying
over
the
ground,
gone
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
Jon
let
him
go.
A
wolf
needed
to
hunt.

He
had
no
destination
in
mind.
He
wanted
only
to
ride.
He
followed
the
creek
for
a
time,
listening
to
the
icy
trickle
of
water
over
rock,
then
cut
across
the
fields
to
the
kingsroad.
It
stretched
out
before
him,
narrow
and
stony
and
pocked
with
weeds,
a
road
of
no
particular
promise,
yet
the
sight
of
it
filled
Jon
Snow
with
a
vast
longing.
Winterfell
was
down
that
road,
and
beyond
it
Riverrun
and
King’s
Landing
and
the
Eyrie
and
so
many
other
places;
Casterly
Rock,
the
Isle
of
Faces,
the
red
mountains
of
Dorne,
the
hundred
islands
of
Braavos
in
the
sea,
the
smoking
ruins
of
old
Valyria.
All
the
places
that
Jon
would
never
see.
The
world
was
down
that
road…
and
he
was
here.

Once
he
swore
his
vow,
the
Wall
would
be
his
home
until
he
was
old
as
Maester
Aemon.
“I
have
not
sworn
yet,”
he
muttered.
He
was
no
outlaw,
bound
to
take
the
black
or
pay
the
penalty
for
his
crimes.
He
had
come
here
freely,
and
he
might
leave
freely…
until
he
said
the
words.
He
need
only
ride
on,
and
he
could
leave
it
all
behind.
By
the
time
the
moon
was
full
again,
he
would
be
back
in
Winterfell
with
his
brothers.

Your
half
brothers,
a
voice
inside
reminded
him.
And
Lady
Stark,
who
will
not
welcome
you.
There
was
no
place
for
him
in
Winterfell,
no
place
in
King’s
Landing
either.
Even
his
own
mother
had
not
had
a
place
for
him.
The
thought
of
her
made
him
sad.
He
wondered
who
she
had
been,
what
she
had
looked
like,
why
his
father
had
left
her.
Because
she
was
a
whore
or
an
adulteress,
fool.
Something
dark
and
dishonorable,
or
else
why
was
Lord
Eddard
too
ashamed
to
speak
of
her?

Jon
Snow
turned
away
from
the
kingsroad
to
look
behind
him.
The
fires
of
Castle
Black
were
hidden
behind
a
hill,
but
the
Wall
was
there,
pale
beneath
the
moon,
vast
and
cold,
running
from
horizon
to
horizon.

He
wheeled
his
horse
around
and
started
for
home.

Ghost
returned
as
he
crested
a
rise
and
saw
the
distant
glow
of
lamplight
from
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower.
The
direwolf
s
muzzle
was
red
with
blood
as
he
trotted
beside
the
horse.
Jon
found
himself
thinking
of
Samwell
Tarly
again
on
the
ride
back.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
stables,
he
knew
what
he
must
do.

Maester
Aemon’s
apartments
were
in
a
stout
wooden
keep
below
the
rookery.
Aged
and
frail,
the
maester
shared
his
chambers
with
two
of
the
younger
stewards,
who
tended
to
his
needs
and
helped
him
in
his
duties.
The
brothers
joked
that
he
had
been
given
the
two
ugliest
men
in
the
Night’s
Watch;
being
blind,
he
was
spared
having
to
look
at
them.
Clydas
was
short,
bald,
and
chinless,
with
small
pink
eyes
like
a
mole.
Chett
had
a
wen
on
his
neck
the
size
of
a
pigeon’s
egg,
and
a
face
red
with
boils
and
pimples.
Perhaps
that
was
why
he
always
seemed
so
angry.

It
was
Chett
who
answered
Jon’s
knock.
“I
need
to
speak
to
Maester
Aemon,”
Jon
told
him.

“The
maester
is
abed,
as
you
should
be.
Come
back
on
the
morrow
and
maybe
he’ll
see
you.”
He
began
to
shut
the
door.

Jon
jammed
it
open
with
his
boot.
“I
need
to
speak
to
him
now.
The
morning
will
be
too
late.”

Chett
scowled.
“The
maester
is
not
accustomed
to
being
woken
in
the
night.
Do
you
know
how
old
he
is?”

“Old
enough
to
treat
visitors
with
more
courtesy
than
you,”
Jon
said.
“Give
him
my
pardons.
I
would
not
disturb
his
rest
if
it
were
not
important.”

“And
if
I
refuse?”

Jon
had
his
boot
wedged
solidly
in
the
door.
“I
can
stand
here
all
night
if
I
must.”

The
black
brother
made
a
disgusted
noise
and
opened
the
door
to
admit
him.
“Wait
in
the
library.
There’s
wood.
Start
a
fire.
I
won’t
have
the
maester
catching
a
chill
on
account
of
you.”

Jon
had
the
logs
crackling
merrily
by
the
time
Chett
led
in
Maester
Aemon.
The
old
man
was
clad
in
his
bed
robe,
but
around
his
throat
was
the
chain
collar
of
his
order.
A
maester
did
not
remove
it
even
to
sleep.
“The
chair
beside
the
fire
would
be
pleasant,”
he
said
when
he
felt
the
warmth
on
his
face.
When
he
was
settled
comfortably,
Chett
covered
his
legs
with
a
fur
and
went
to
stand
by
the
door.

“I
am
sorry
to
have
woken
you,
Maester,”
Jon
Snow
said.

“You
did
not
wake
me,”
Maester
Aemon
replied.
“I
find
I
need
less
sleep
as
I
grow
older,
and
I
am
grown
very
old.
I
often
spend
half
the
night
with
ghosts,
remembering
times
fifty
years
past
as
if
they
were
yesterday.
The
mystery
of
a
midnight
visitor
is
a
welcome
diversion.
So
tell
me,
Jon
Snow,
why
have
you
come
calling
at
this
strange
hour?”

“To
ask
that
Samwell
Tarly
be
taken
from
training
and
accepted
as
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”

“This
is
no
concern
of
Maester
Aemon,”
Chett
complained.

“Our
Lord
Commander
has
given
the
training
of
recruits
into
the
hands
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne,”
the
maester
said
gently.
“Only
he
may
say
when
a
boy
is
ready
to
swear
his
vow,
as
you
surely
know.
Why
then
come
to
me?”

“The
Lord
Commander
listens
to
you,”
Jon
told
him.
“And
the
wounded
and
the
sick
of
the
Night’s
Watch
are
in
your
charge.”

“And
is
your
friend
Samwell
wounded
or
sick?”

“He
will
be,”
Jon
promised,
“unless
you
help.”

He
told
them
all
of
it,
even
the
part
where
he’d
set
Ghost
at
Rast’s
throat.
Maester
Aemon
listened
silently,
blind
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire,
but
Chett’s
face
darkened
with
each
word.
“Without
us
to
keep
him
safe,
Sam
will
have
no
chance,”
Jon
finished.
“He’s
hopeless
with
a
sword.
My
sister
Arya
could
tear
him
apart,
and
she’s
not
yet
ten.
If
Ser
Alliser
makes
him
fight,
it’s
only
a
matter
of
time
before
he’s
hurt
or
killed.”

Chett
could
stand
no
more.
“I’ve
seen
this
fat
boy
in
the
common
hall,”
he
said.
“He
is
a
pig,
and
a
hopeless
craven
as
well,
if
what
you
say
is
true.”

“Maybe
it
is
so,”
Maester
Aemon
said.
“Tell
me,
Chett,
what
would
you
have
us
do
with
such
a
boy?”

“Leave
him
where
he
is,”
Chett
said.
“The
Wall
is
no
place
for
the
weak.
Let
him
train
until
he
is
ready,
no
matter
how
many
years
that
takes.
Ser
Alliser
shall
make
a
man
of
him
or
kill
him,
as
the
gods
will.”

“That’s
stupid,”
Jon
said.
He
took
a
deep
breath
to
gather
his
thoughts.
“I
remember
once
I
asked
Maester
Luwin
why
he
wore
a
chain
around
his
throat.”

Maester
Aemon
touched
his
own
collar
lightly,
his
bony,
wrinkled
finger
stroking
the
heavy
metal
links.
“Go
on.”

“He
told
me
that
a
maester’s
collar
is
made
of
chain
to
remind
him
that
he
is
sworn
to
serve,”
Jon
said,
remembering.
“I
asked
why
each
link
was
a
different
metal.
A
silver
chain
would
look
much
finer
with
his
grey
robes,
I
said.
Maester
Luwin
laughed.
A
maester
forges
his
chain
with
study,
he
told
me.
The
different
metals
are
each
a
different
kind
of
learning,
gold
for
the
study
of
money
and
accounts,
silver
for
healing,
iron
for
warcraft.
And
he
said
there
were
other
meanings
as
well.
The
collar
is
supposed
to
remind
a
maester
of
the
realm
he
serves,
isn’t
that
so?
Lords
are
gold
and
knights
steel,
but
two
links
can’t
make
a
chain.
You
also
need
silver
and
iron
and
lead,
tin
and
copper
and
bronze
and
all
the
rest,
and
those
are
farmers
and
smiths
and
merchants
and
the
like.
A
chain
needs
all
sorts
of
metals,
and
a
land
needs
all
sorts
of
people.”

Maester
Aemon
smiled.
“And
so?”

“The
Night’s
Watch
needs
all
sorts
too.
Why
else
have
rangers
and
stewards
and
builders?
Lord
Randyll
couldn’t
make
Sam
a
warrior,
and
Ser
Alliser
won’t
either.
You
can’t
hammer
tin
into
iron,
no
matter
how
hard
you
beat
it,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
tin
is
useless.
Why
shouldn’t
Sam
be
a
steward?”

Chett
gave
an
angry
scowl.
“I’m
a
steward.
You
think
it’s
easy
work,
fit
for
cowards?
The
order
of
stewards
keeps
the
Watch
alive.
We
hunt
and
farm,
tend
the
horses,
milk
the
cows,
gather
firewood,
cook
the
meals.
Who
do
you
think
makes
your
clothing?
Who
brings
up
supplies
from
the
south?
The
stewards.”

Maester
Aemon
was
gentler.
“Is
your
friend
a
hunter?”

“He
hates
hunting,”
Jon
had
to
admit.

“Can
he
plow
a
field?”
the
maester
asked.
“Can
he
drive
a
wagon
or
sail
a
ship?
Could
he
butcher
a
cow?”

“No.”

Chett
gave
a
nasty
laugh.
“I’ve
seen
what
happens
to
soft
lordlings
when
they’re
put
to
work.
Set
them
to
churning
butter
and
their
hands
blister
and
bleed.
Give
them
an
axe
to
split
logs,
and
they
cut
off
their
own
foot.”

“I
know
one
thing
Sam
could
do
better
than
anyone.”

“Yes?”
Maester
Aemon
prompted.

Jon
glanced
warily
at
Chett,
standing
beside
the
door,
his
boils
red
and
angry.
“He
could
help
you,”
he
said
quickly.
“He
can
do
sums,
and
he
knows
how
to
read
and
write.
I
know
Chett
can’t
read,
and
Clydas
has
weak
eyes.
Sam
read
every
book
in
his
father’s
library.
He’d
be
good
with
the
ravens
too.
Animals
seem
to
like
him.
Ghost
took
to
him
straight
off.
There’s
a
lot
he
could
do,
besides
fighting.
The
Night’s
Watch
needs
every
man.
Why
kill
one,
to
no
end?
Make
use
of
him
instead.”

Maester
Aemon
closed
his
eyes,
and
for
a
brief
moment
Jon
was
afraid
that
he
had
gone
to
sleep.
Finally
he
said,
“Maester
Luwin
taught
you
well,
Jon
Snow.
Your
mind
is
as
deft
as
your
blade,
it
would
seem.”

“Does
that
mean…”

“It
means
I
shall
think
on
what
you
have
said,”
the
maester
told
him
firmly.
“And
now,
I
believe
I
am
ready
to
sleep.
Chett,
show
our
young
brother
to
the
door.”





TYRION

They
had
taken
shelter
beneath
a
copse
of
aspens
just
off
the
high
road.
Tyrion
was
gathering
deadwood
while
their
horses
took
water
from
a
mountain
stream.
He
stooped
to
pick
up
a
splintered
branch
and
examined
it
critically.
“Will
this
do?
I
am
not
practiced
at
starting
fires.
Morrec
did
that
for
me.”

“A
fire?”
Bronn
said,
spitting.
“Are
you
so
hungry
to
die,
dwarf?
Or
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses?
A
fire
will
bring
the
clansmen
down
on
us
from
miles
around.
I
mean
to
survive
this
journey,
Lannister.”

“And
how
do
you
hope
to
do
that?”
Tyrion
asked.
He
tucked
the
branch
under
his
arm
and
poked
around
through
the
sparse
undergrowth,
looking
for
more.
His
back
ached
from
the
effort
of
bending;
they
had
been
riding
since
daybreak,
when
a
stone-faced
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
had
ushered
them
through
the
Bloody
Gate
and
commanded
them
never
to
return.

“We
have
no
chance
of
fighting
our
way
back,”
Bronn
said,
“but
two
can
cover
more
ground
than
ten,
and
attract
less
notice.
The
fewer
days
we
spend
in
these
mountains,
the
more
like
we
are
to
reach
the
riverlands.
Ride
hard
and
fast,
I
say.
Travel
by
night
and
hole
up
by
day,
avoid
the
road
where
we
can,
make
no
noise
and
light
no
fires.”

Tyrion
Lannister
sighed.
“A
splendid
plan,
Bronn.
Try
it,
as
you
like…
and
forgive
me
if
I
do
not
linger
to
bury
you.”

“You
think
to
outlive
me,
dwarf?”
The
sellsword
grinned.
He
had
a
dark
gap
in
his
smile
where
the
edge
of
Ser
Vardis
Egen’s
shield
had
cracked
a
tooth
in
half.

Tyrion
shrugged.
“Riding
hard
and
fast
by
night
is
a
sure
way
to
tumble
down
a
mountain
and
crack
your
skull.
I
prefer
to
make
my
crossing
slow
and
easy.
I
know
you
love
the
taste
of
horse,
Bronn,
but
if
our
mounts
die
under
us
this
time,
we’ll
be
trying
to
saddle
shadowcats…
and
if
truth
be
told,
I
think
the
clans
will
find
us
no
matter
what
we
do.
Their
eyes
are
all
around
us.”
He
swept
a
gloved
hand
over
the
high,
wind-carved
crags
that
surrounded
them.

Bronn
grimaced.
“Then
we’re
dead
men,
Lannister.”

“If
so,
I
prefer
to
die
comfortable,”
Tyrion
replied.
“We
need
a
fire.
The
nights
are
cold
up
here,
and
hot
food
will
warm
our
bellies
and
lift
our
spirits.
Do
you
suppose
there’s
any
game
to
be
had?
Lady
Lysa
has
kindly
provided
us
with
a
veritable
feast
of
salt
beef,
hard
cheese,
and
stale
bread,
but
I
would
hate
to
break
a
tooth
so
far
from
the
nearest
maester.”

“I
can
find
meat.”
Beneath
a
fall
of
black
hair,
Bronn’s
dark
eyes
regarded
Tyrion
suspiciously.
“I
should
leave
you
here
with
your
fool’s
fire.
If
I
took
your
horse,
I’d
have
twice
the
chance
to
make
it
through.
What
would
you
do
then,
dwarf?”

“Die,
most
like.”
Tyrion
stooped
to
get
another
stick.

“You
don’t
think
I’d
do
it?”

“You’d
do
it
in
an
instant,
if
it
meant
your
life.
You
were
quick
enough
to
silence
your
friend
Chiggen
when
he
caught
that
arrow
in
his
belly.”
Bronn
had
yanked
back
the
man’s
head
by
the
hair
and
driven
the
point
of
his
dirk
in
under
the
ear,
and
afterward
told
Catelyn
Stark
that
the
other
sellsword
had
died
of
his
wound.

“He
was
good
as
dead,”
Bronn
said,
“and
his
moaning
was
bringing
them
down
on
us.
Chiggen
would
have
done
the
same
for
me…
and
he
was
no
friend,
only
a
man
I
rode
with.
Make
no
mistake,
dwarf.
I
fought
for
you,
but
I
do
not
love
you.”

“It
was
your
blade
I
needed,”
Tyrion
said,
“not
your
love.”
He
dumped
his
armful
of
wood
on
the
ground.

Bronn
grinned.
“You’re
bold
as
any
sellsword,
I’ll
give
you
that.
How
did
you
know
I’d
take
your
part?”

“Know?”
Tyrion
squatted
awkwardly
on
his
stunted
legs
to
build
the
fire.
“I
tossed
the
dice.
Back
at
the
inn,
you
and
Chiggen
helped
take
me
captive.
Why?
The
others
saw
it
as
their
duty,
for
the
honor
of
the
lords
they
served,
but
not
you
two.
You
had
no
lord,
no
duty,
and
precious
little
honor,
so
why
trouble
to
involve
yourselves?”
He
took
out
his
knife
and
whittled
some
thin
strips
of
bark
off
one
of
the
sticks
he’d
gathered,
to
serve
as
kindling.
“Well,
why
do
sellswords
do
anything?
For
gold.
You
were
thinking
Lady
Catelyn
would
reward
you
for
your
help,
perhaps
even
take
you
into
her
service.
Here,
that
should
do,
I
hope.
Do
you
have
a
flint?”

Bronn
slid
two
fingers
into
the
pouch
at
his
belt
and
tossed
down
a
flint.
Tyrion
caught
it
in
the
air.

“My
thanks,”
he
said.
“The
thing
is,
you
did
not
know
the
Starks.
Lord
Eddard
is
a
proud,
honorable,
and
honest
man,
and
his
lady
wife
is
worse.
Oh,
no
doubt
she
would
have
found
a
coin
or
two
for
you
when
this
was
all
over,
and
pressed
it
in
your
hand
with
a
polite
word
and
a
look
of
distaste,
but
that’s
the
most
you
could
have
hoped
for.
The
Starks
look
for
courage
and
loyalty
and
honor
in
the
men
they
choose
to
serve
them,
and
if
truth
be
told,
you
and
Chiggen
were
lowborn
scum.”
Tyrion
struck
the
flint
against
his
dagger,
trying
for
a
spark.
Nothing.

Bronn
snorted.
“You
have
a
bold
tongue,
little
man.
One
day
someone
is
like
to
cut
it
out
and
make
you
eat
it.”

“Everyone
tells
me
that.”
Tyrion
glanced
up
at
the
sellsword.
“Did
I
offend
you?
My
pardons…
but
you
are
scum,
Bronn,
make
no
mistake.
Duty,
honor,
friendship,
what’s
that
to
you?
No,
don’t
trouble
yourself,
we
both
know
the
answer.
Still,
you’re
not
stupid.
Once
we
reached
the
Vale,
Lady
Stark
had
no
more
need
of
you…
but
I
did,
and
the
one
thing
the
Lannisters
have
never
lacked
for
is
gold.
When
the
moment
came
to
toss
the
dice,
I
was
counting
on
your
being
smart
enough
to
know
where
your
best
interest
lay.
Happily
for
me,
you
did.”
He
slammed
stone
and
steel
together
again,
fruitlessly.

“Here,”
said
Bronn,
squatting,
“I’ll
do
it.”
He
took
the
knife
and
flint
from
Tyrion’s
hands
and
struck
sparks
on
his
first
try.
A
curl
of
bark
began
to
smolder.

“Well
done,”
Tyrion
said.
“Scum
you
may
be,
but
you’re
undeniably
useful,
and
with
a
sword
in
your
hand
you’re
almost
as
good
as
my
brother
Jaime.
What
do
you
want,
Bronn?
Gold?
Land?
Women?
Keep
me
alive,
and
you’ll
have
it.”

Bronn
blew
gently
on
the
fire,
and
the
flames
leapt
up
higher.
“And
if
you
die?”

“Why
then,
I’ll
have
one
mourner
whose
grief
is
sincere,”
Tyrion
said,
grinning.
“The
gold
ends
when
I
do.”

The
fire
was
blazing
up
nicely.
Bronn
stood,
tucked
the
flint
back
into
his
pouch,
and
tossed
Tyrion
his
dagger.
“Fair
enough,”
he
said.
“My
sword’s
yours,
then…
but
don’t
go
looking
for
me
to
bend
the
knee
and
m’lord
you
every
time
you
take
a
shit.
I’m
no
man’s
toady.”

“Nor
any
man’s
friend,”
Tyrion
said.
“I’ve
no
doubt
you’d
betray
me
as
quick
as
you
did
Lady
Stark,
if
you
saw
a
profit
in
it.
If
the
day
ever
comes
when
you’re
tempted
to
sell
me
out,
remember
this,
Bronn—I’ll
match
their
price,
whatever
it
is.
I
like
living.
And
now,
do
you
think
you
could
do
something
about
finding
us
some
supper?”

“Take
care
of
the
horses,”
Bronn
said,
unsheathing
the
long
dirk
he
wore
at
his
hip.
He
strode
into
the
trees.

An
hour
later
the
horses
had
been
rubbed
down
and
fed,
the
fire
was
crackling
away
merrily,
and
a
haunch
of
a
young
goat
was
turning
above
the
flames,
spitting
and
hissing.
“All
we
lack
now
is
some
good
wine
to
wash
down
our
kid,”
Tyrion
said.

“That,
a
woman,
and
another
dozen
swords,”
Bronn
said.
He
sat
cross-legged
beside
the
fire,
honing
the
edge
of
his
longsword
with
an
oilstone.
There
was
something
strangely
reassuring
about
the
rasping
sound
it
made
when
he
drew
it
down
the
steel.
“It
will
be
full
dark
soon,”
the
sellsword
pointed
out.
“I’ll
take
first
watch…
for
all
the
good
it
will
do
us.
It
might
be
kinder
to
let
them
kill
us
in
our
sleep.”

“Oh,
I
imagine
they’ll
be
here
long
before
it
comes
to
sleep.”
The
smell
of
the
roasting
meat
made
Tyrion’s
mouth
water.

Bronn
watched
him
across
the
fire.
“You
have
a
plan,”
he
said
flatly,
with
a
scrape
of
steel
on
stone.

“A
hope,
call
it,”
Tyrion
said.
“Another
toss
of
the
dice.”

“With
our
lives
as
the
stake?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“What
choice
do
we
have?”
He
leaned
over
the
fire
and
sawed
a
thin
slice
of
meat
from
the
kid.
“Ahhhh,”
he
sighed
happily
as
he
chewed.
Grease
ran
down
his
chin.
“A
bit
tougher
than
I’d
like,
and
in
want
of
spicing,
but
I’ll
not
complain
too
loudly.
If
I
were
back
at
the
Eyrie,
I’d
be
dancing
on
a
precipice
in
hopes
of
a
boiled
bean.”

“And
yet
you
gave
the
turnkey
a
purse
of
gold,”
Bronn
said.

“A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts.”

Even
Mord
had
scarcely
believed
it
when
Tyrion
tossed
him
the
leather
purse.
The
gaoler’s
eyes
had
gone
big
as
boiled
eggs
as
he
yanked
open
the
drawstring
and
beheld
the
glint
of
gold.
“I
kept
the
silver,”
Tyrion
had
told
him
with
a
crooked
smile,
“but
you
were
promised
the
gold,
and
there
it
is.”
It
was
more
than
a
man
like
Mord
could
hope
to
earn
in
a
lifetime
of
abusing
prisoners.
“And
remember
what
I
said,
this
is
only
a
taste.
If
you
ever
grow
tired
of
Lady
Arryn’s
service,
present
yourself
at
Casterly
Rock,
and
I’ll
pay
you
the
rest
of
what
I
owe
you.”
With
golden
dragons
spilling
out
of
both
hands,
Mord
had
fallen
to
his
knees
and
promised
that
he
would
do
just
that.

Bronn
yanked
out
his
dirk
and
pulled
the
meat
from
the
fire.
He
began
to
carve
thick
chunks
of
charred
meat
off
the
bone
as
Tyrion
hollowed
out
two
heels
of
stale
bread
to
serve
as
trenchers.
“If
we
do
reach
the
river,
what
will
you
do
then?”
the
sellsword
asked
as
he
cut.

“Oh,
a
whore
and
a
featherbed
and
a
flagon
of
wine,
for
a
start.”
Tyrion
held
out
his
trencher,
and
Bronn
filled
it
with
meat.
“And
then
to
Casterly
Rock
or
King’s
Landing,
I
think.
I
have
some
questions
that
want
answering,
concerning
a
certain
dagger.”

The
sellsword
chewed
and
swallowed.
“So
you
were
telling
it
true?
It
was
not
your
knife?”

Tyrion
smiled
thinly.
“Do
I
look
a
liar
to
you?”

By
the
time
their
bellies
were
full,
the
stars
had
come
out
and
a
halfmoon
was
rising
over
the
mountains.
Tyrion
spread
his
shadowskin
cloak
on
the
ground
and
stretched
out
with
his
saddle
for
a
pillow.
“Our
friends
are
taking
their
sweet
time.”

“If
I
were
them,
I’d
fear
a
trap,”
Bronn
said.
“Why
else
would
we
be
so
open,
if
not
to
lure
them
in?”

Tyrion
chuckled.
“Then
we
ought
to
sing
and
send
them
fleeing
in
terror.”
He
began
to
whistle
a
tune.

“You’re
mad,
dwarf,”
Bronn
said
as
he
cleaned
the
grease
out
from
under
his
nails
with
his
dirk.

“Where’s
your
love
of
music,
Bronn?”

“If
it
was
music
you
wanted,
you
should
have
gotten
the
singer
to
champion
you.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“That
would
have
been
amusing.
I
can
just
see
him
fending
off
Ser
Vardis
with
his
woodharp.”
He
resumed
his
whistling.
“Do
you
know
this
song?”
he
asked.

“You
hear
it
here
and
there,
in
inns
and
whorehouses.”

“Myrish.
‘The
Seasons
of
My
Love.’
Sweet
and
sad,
if
you
understand
the
words.
The
first
girl
I
ever
bedded
used
to
sing
it,
and
I’ve
never
been
able
to
put
it
out
of
my
head.”
Tyrion
gazed
up
at
the
sky.
It
was
a
clear
cold
night
and
the
stars
shone
down
upon
the
mountains
as
bright
and
merciless
as
truth.
“I
met
her
on
a
night
like
this,”
he
heard
himself
saying.
“Jaime
and
I
were
riding
back
from
Lannisport
when
we
heard
a
scream,
and
she
came
running
out
into
the
road
with
two
men
dogging
her
heels,
shouting
threats.
My
brother
unsheathed
his
sword
and
went
after
them,
while
I
dismounted
to
protect
the
girl.
She
was
scarcely
a
year
older
than
I
was,
dark-haired,
slender,
with
a
face
that
would
break
your
heart.
It
certainly
broke
mine.
Lowborn,
half-starved,
unwashed…
yet
lovely.
They’d
torn
the
rags
she
was
wearing
half
off
her
back,
so
I
wrapped
her
in
my
cloak
while
Jaime
chased
the
men
into
the
woods.
By
the
time
he
came
trotting
back,
I’d
gotten
a
name
out
of
her,
and
a
story.
She
was
a
crofter’s
child,
orphaned
when
her
father
died
of
fever,
on
her
way
to…
well,
nowhere,
really.

“Jaime
was
all
in
a
lather
to
hunt
down
the
men.
It
was
not
often
outlaws
dared
prey
on
travelers
so
near
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
he
took
it
as
an
insult.
The
girl
was
too
frightened
to
send
off
by
herself,
though,
so
I
offered
to
take
her
to
the
closest
inn
and
feed
her
while
my
brother
rode
back
to
the
Rock
for
help.

“She
was
hungrier
than
I
would
have
believed.
We
finished
two
whole
chickens
and
part
of
a
third,
and
drank
a
flagon
of
wine,
talking.
I
was
only
thirteen,
and
the
wine
went
to
my
head,
I
fear.
The
next
thing
I
knew,
I
was
sharing
her
bed.
If
she
was
shy,
I
was
shyer.
I’ll
never
know
where
I
found
the
courage.
When
I
broke
her
maidenhead,
she
wept,
but
afterward
she
kissed
me
and
sang
her
little
song,
and
by
morning
I
was
in
love.”

“You?”
Bronn’s
voice
was
amused.

“Absurd,
isn’t
it?”
Tyrion
began
to
whistle
the
song
again.
“I
married
her,”
he
finally
admitted.

“A
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock
wed
to
a
crofter’s
daughter,”
Bronn
said.
“How
did
you
manage
that?”

“Oh,
you’d
be
astonished
at
what
a
boy
can
make
of
a
few
lies,
fifty
pieces
of
silver,
and
a
drunken
septon.
I
dared
not
bring
my
bride
home
to
Casterly
Rock,
so
I
set
her
up
in
a
cottage
of
her
own,
and
for
a
fortnight
we
played
at
being
man
and
wife.
And
then
the
septon
sobered
and
confessed
all
to
my
lord
father.”
Tyrion
was
surprised
at
how
desolate
it
made
him
feel
to
say
it,
even
after
all
these
years.
Perhaps
he
was
just
tired.
“That
was
the
end
of
my
marriage.”
He
sat
up
and
stared
at
the
dying
fire,
blinking
at
the
light.

“He
sent
the
girl
away?”

“He
did
better
than
that,”
Tyrion
said.
“First
he
made
my
brother
tell
me
the
truth.
The
girl
was
a
whore,
you
see.
Jaime
arranged
the
whole
affair,
the
road,
the
outlaws,
all
of
it.
He
thought
it
was
time
I
had
a
woman.
He
paid
double
for
a
maiden,
knowing
it
would
be
my
first
time.

“After
Jaime
had
made
his
confession,
to
drive
home
the
lesson,
Lord
Tywin
brought
my
wife
in
and
gave
her
to
his
guards.
They
paid
her
fair
enough.
A
silver
for
each
man,
how
many
whores
command
that
high
a
price?
He
sat
me
down
in
the
corner
of
the
barracks
and
bade
me
watch,
and
at
the
end
she
had
so
many
silvers
the
coins
were
slipping
through
her
fingers
and
rolling
on
the
floor,
she…”
The
smoke
was
stinging
his
eyes.
Tyrion
cleared
his
throat
and
turned
away
from
the
fire,
to
gaze
out
into
darkness.
“Lord
Tywin
had
me
go
last,”
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice.
“And
he
gave
me
a
gold
coin
to
pay
her,
because
I
was
a
Lannister,
and
worth
more.”

After
a
time
he
heard
the
noise
again,
the
rasp
of
steel
on
stone
as
Bronn
sharpened
his
sword.
“Thirteen
or
thirty
or
three,
I
would
have
killed
the
man
who
did
that
to
me.”

Tyrion
swung
around
to
face
him.
“You
may
get
that
chance
one
day.
Remember
what
I
told
you.
A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts.”
He
yawned.
“I
think
I
will
try
and
sleep.
Wake
me
if
we’re
about
to
die.”

He
rolled
himself
up
in
the
shadowskin
and
shut
his
eyes.
The
ground
was
stony
and
cold,
but
after
a
time
Tyrion
Lannister
did
sleep.
He
dreamt
of
the
sky
cell.
This
time
he
was
the
gaoler,
not
the
prisoner,
big,
with
a
strap
in
his
hand,
and
he
was
hitting
his
father,
driving
him
back,
toward
the
abyss…

“Tyrion.”
Bronn’s
warning
was
low
and
urgent.

Tyrion
was
awake
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
The
fire
had
burned
down
to
embers,
and
the
shadows
were
creeping
in
all
around
them.
Bronn
had
raised
himself
to
one
knee,
his
sword
in
one
hand
and
his
dirk
in
the
other.
Tyrion
held
up
a
hand:
stay
still,
it
said.
“Come
share
our
fire,
the
night
is
cold,”
he
called
out
to
the
creeping
shadows.
“I
fear
we’ve
no
wine
to
offer
you,
but
you’re
welcome
to
some
of
our
goat.”

All
movement
stopped.
Tyrion
saw
the
glint
of
moonlight
on
metal.
“Our
mountain,”
a
voice
called
out
from
the
trees,
deep
and
hard
and
unfriendly.
“Our
goat.”

“Your
goat,”
Tyrion
agreed.
“Who
are
you?”

“When
you
meet
your
gods,”
a
different
voice
replied,
“say
it
was
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn
of
the
Stone
Crows
who
sent
you
to
them.”
A
branch
cracked
underfoot
as
he
stepped
into
the
light;
a
thin
man
in
a
horned
helmet,
armed
with
a
long
knife.

“And
Shagga
son
of
Dolf.”
That
was
the
first
voice,
deep
and
deadly.
A
boulder
shifted
to
their
left,
and
stood,
and
became
a
man.
Massive
and
slow
and
strong
he
seemed,
dressed
all
in
skins,
with
a
club
in
his
right
hand
and
an
axe
in
his
left.
He
smashed
them
together
as
he
lumbered
closer.

Other
voices
called
other
names,
Conn
and
Torrek
and
Jaggot
and
more
that
Tyrion
forgot
the
instant
he
heard
them;
ten
at
least.
A
few
had
swords
and
knives;
others
brandished
pitchforks
and
scythes
and
wooden
spears.
He
waited
until
they
were
done
shouting
out
their
names
before
he
gave
them
answer.
“I
am
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin,
of
the
Clan
Lannister,
the
Lions
of
the
Rock.
We
will
gladly
pay
you
for
the
goat
we
ate.”

“What
do
you
have
to
give
us,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?”
asked
the
one
who
named
himself
Gunthor,
who
seemed
to
be
their
chief.

“There
is
silver
in
my
purse,”
Tyrion
told
them.
“This
hauberk
I
wear
is
large
for
me,
but
it
should
fit
Conn
nicely,
and
the
battle-axe
I
carry
would
suit
Shagga’s
mighty
hand
far
better
than
that
wood-axe
he
holds.”

“The
halfman
would
pay
us
with
our
own
coin,”
said
Conn.

“Conn
speaks
truly,”
Gunthor
said.
“Your
silver
is
ours.
Your
horses
are
ours.
Your
hauberk
and
your
battle-axe
and
the
knife
at
your
belt,
those
are
ours
too.
You
have
nothing
to
give
us
but
your
lives.
How
would
you
like
to
die,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?”

“In
my
own
bed,
with
a
belly
full
of
wine
and
a
maiden’s
mouth
around
my
cock,
at
the
age
of
eighty,”
he
replied.

The
huge
one,
Shagga,
laughed
first
and
loudest.
The
others
seemed
less
amused.
“Conn,
take
their
horses,”
Gunthor
commanded.
“Kill
the
other
and
seize
the
halfinan.
He
can
milk
the
goats
and
make
the
mothers
laugh.”

Bronn
sprang
to
his
feet.
“Who
dies
first?”

“No!”
Tyrion
said
sharply.
“Gunthor
son
of
Gurn,
hear
me.
My
House
is
rich
and
powerful.
If
the
Stone
Crows
will
see
us
safely
through
these
mountains,
my
lord
father
will
shower
you
with
gold.”

“The
gold
of
a
lowland
lord
is
as
worthless
as
a
halfman’s
promises,”
Gunthor
said.

“Half
a
man
I
may
be,”
Tyrion
said,
“yet
I
have
the
courage
to
face
my
enemies.
What
do
the
Stone
Crows
do,
but
hide
behind
rocks
and
shiver
with
fear
as
the
knights
of
the
Vale
ride
by?”

Shagga
gave
a
roar
of
anger
and
clashed
club
against
axe.
Jaggot
poked
at
Tyrion’s
face
with
the
fire-hardened
point
of
a
long
wooden
spear.
He
did
his
best
not
to
flinch.
“Are
these
the
best
weapons
you
could
steal?”
he
said.
“Good
enough
for
killing
sheep,
perhaps…
if
the
sheep
do
not
fight
back.
My
father’s
smiths
shit
better
steel.”

“Little
boyman,”
Shagga
roared,
“will
you
mock
my
axe
after
I
chop
off
your
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats?”

But
Gunthor
raised
a
hand.
“No.
I
would
hear
his
words.
The
mothers
go
hungry,
and
steel
fills
more
mouths
than
gold.
What
would
you
give
us
for
your
lives,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?
Swords?
Lances?
Mail?”

“All
that,
and
more,
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied,
smiling.
“I
will
give
you
the
Vale
of
Arryn.”





EDDARD

Through
the
high
narrow
windows
of
the
Red
Keep’s
cavernous
throne
room,
the
light
of
sunset
spilled
across
the
floor,
laying
dark
red
stripes
upon
the
walls
where
the
heads
of
dragons
had
once
hung.
Now
the
stone
was
covered
with
hunting
tapestries,
vivid
with
greens
and
browns
and
blues,
and
yet
still
it
seemed
to
Ned
Stark
that
the
only
color
in
the
hall
was
the
red
of
blood.

He
sat
high
upon
the
immense
ancient
seat
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror,
an
ironwork
monstrosity
of
spikes
and
jagged
edges
and
grotesquely
twisted
metal.
It
was,
as
Robert
had
warned
him,
a
hellishly
uncomfortable
chair,
and
never
more
so
than
now,
with
his
shattered
leg
throbbing
more
sharply
every
minute.
The
metal
beneath
him
had
grown
harder
by
the
hour,
and
the
fanged
steel
behind
made
it
impossible
to
lean
back.
A
king
should
never
sit
easy,
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
said,
when
he
commanded
his
armorers
to
forge
a
great
seat
from
the
swords
laid
down
by
his
enemies.
Damn
Aegon
for
his
arrogance,
Ned
thought
sullenly,
and
damn
Robert
and
his
hunting
as
well.

“You
are
quite
certain
these
were
more
than
brigands?”
Varys
asked
softly
from
the
council
table
beneath
the
throne.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stirred
uneasily
beside
him,
while
Littlefinger
toyed
with
a
pen.
They
were
the
only
councillors
in
attendance.
A
white
hart
had
been
sighted
in
the
kingswood,
and
Lord
Renly
and
Ser
Barristan
had
joined
the
king
to
hunt
it,
along
with
Prince
Joffrey,
Sandor
Clegane,
Balon
Swann,
and
half
the
court.
So
Ned
must
needs
sit
the
Iron
Throne
in
his
absence.

At
least
he
could
sit.
Save
the
council,
the
rest
must
stand
respectfully,
or
kneel.
The
petitioners
clustered
near
the
tall
doors,
the
knights
and
high
lords
and
ladies
beneath
the
tapestries,
the
smallfolk
in
the
gallery,
the
mailed
guards
in
their
cloaks,
gold
or
grey:
all
stood.

The
villagers
were
kneeling:
men,
women,
and
children,
alike
tattered
and
bloody,
their
faces
drawn
by
fear.
The
three
knights
who
had
brought
them
here
to
bear
witness
stood
behind
them.

“Brigands,
Lord
Varys?”
Ser
Raymun
Darry’s
voice
dripped
scorn.
“Oh,
they
were
brigands,
beyond
a
doubt.
Lannister
brigands.”

Ned
could
feel
the
unease
in
the
hall,
as
high
lords
and
servants
alike
strained
to
listen.
He
could
not
pretend
to
surprise.
The
west
had
been
a
tinderbox
since
Catelyn
had
seized
Tyrion
Lannister.
Both
Riverrun
and
Casterly
Rock
had
called
their
banners,
and
armies
were
massing
in
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth.
It
had
only
been
a
matter
of
time
until
the
blood
began
to
flow.
The
sole
question
that
remained
was
how
best
to
stanch
the
wound.

Sad-eyed
Ser
Karyl
Vance,
who
would
have
been
handsome
but
for
the
winestain
birthmark
that
discolored
his
face,
gestured
at
the
kneeling
villagers.
“This
is
all
the
remains
of
the
holdfast
of
Sherrer,
Lord
Eddard.
The
rest
are
dead,
along
with
the
people
of
Wendish
Town
and
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

“Rise,”
Ned
commanded
the
villagers.
He
never
trusted
what
a
man
told
him
from
his
knees.
“All
of
you,
up.”

In
ones
and
twos,
the
holdfast
of
Sherrer
struggled
to
its
feet.
One
ancient
needed
to
be
helped,
and
a
young
girl
in
a
bloody
dress
stayed
on
her
knees,
staring
blankly
at
Ser
Arys
Oakheart,
who
stood
by
the
foot
of
the
throne
in
the
white
armor
of
the
Kingsguard,
ready
to
protect
and
defend
the
king…
or,
Ned
supposed,
the
King’s
Hand.

“Joss,”
Ser
Raymun
Darry
said
to
a
plump
balding
man
in
a
brewer’s
apron.
“Tell
the
Hand
what
happened
at
Sherrer.”

Joss
nodded.
“If
it
please
His
Grace—”

“His
Grace
is
hunting
across
the
Blackwater,”
Ned
said,
wondering
how
a
man
could
live
his
whole
life
a
few
days
ride
from
the
Red
Keep
and
still
have
no
notion
what
his
king
looked
like.
Ned
was
clad
in
a
white
linen
doublet
with
the
direwolf
of
Stark
on
the
breast;
his
black
wool
cloak
was
fastened
at
the
collar
by
his
silver
hand
of
office.
Black
and
white
and
grey,
all
the
shades
of
truth.
“I
am
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
the
King’s
Hand.
Tell
me
who
you
are
and
what
you
know
of
these
raiders.”

“I
keep…
I
kept…
I
kept
an
alehouse,
m’lord,
in
Sherrer,
by
the
stone
bridge.
The
finest
ale
south
of
the
Neck,
everyone
said
so,
begging
your
pardons,
m’lord.
It’s
gone
now
like
all
the
rest,
m’lord.
They
come
and
drank
their
fill
and
spilled
the
rest
before
they
fired
my
roof,
and
they
would
of
spilled
my
blood
too,
if
they’d
caught
me.
M’lord.”

“They
burnt
us
out,”
a
farmer
beside
him
said.
“Come
riding
in
the
dark,
up
from
the
south,
and
fired
the
fields
and
the
houses
alike,
killing
them
as
tried
to
stop
them.
They
weren’t
no
raiders,
though,
m’lord.
They
had
no
mind
to
steal
our
stock,
not
these,
they
butchered
my
milk
cow
where
she
stood
and
left
her
for
the
flies
and
the
crows.”

“They
rode
down
my
’prentice
boy,”
said
a
squat
man
with
a
smith’s
muscles
and
a
bandage
around
his
head.
He
had
put
on
his
finest
clothes
to
come
to
court,
but
his
breeches
were
patched,
his
cloak
travel-stained
and
dusty.
“Chased
him
back
and
forth
across
the
fields
on
their
horses,
poking
at
him
with
their
lances
like
it
was
a
game,
them
laughing
and
the
boy
stumbling
and
screaming
till
the
big
one
pierced
him
clean
through.”

The
girl
on
her
knees
craned
her
head
up
at
Ned,
high
above
her
on
the
throne.
“They
killed
my
mother
too,
Your
Grace.
And
they…
they…”
Her
voice
trailed
off,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
she
was
about
to
say.
She
began
to
sob.

Ser
Raymun
Darry
took
up
the
tale.
“At
Wendish
Town,
the
people
sought
shelter
in
their
holdfast,
but
the
walls
were
timbered.
The
raiders
piled
straw
against
the
wood
and
burnt
them
all
alive.
When
the
Wendish
folk
opened
their
gates
to
flee
the
fire,
they
shot
them
down
with
arrows
as
they
came
running
out,
even
women
with
suckling
babes.”

“Oh,
dreadful,”
murmured
Varys.
“How
cruel
can
men
be?”

“They
would
of
done
the
same
for
us,
but
the
Sherrer
holdfast’s
made
of
stone,”
Joss
said.
“Some
wanted
to
smoke
us
out,
but
the
big
one
said
there
was
riper
fruit
upriver,
and
they
made
for
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

Ned
could
feel
cold
steel
against
his
fingers
as
he
leaned
forward.
Between
each
finger
was
a
blade,
the
points
of
twisted
swords
fanning
out
like
talons
from
arms
of
the
throne.
Even
after
three
centuries,
some
were
still
sharp
enough
to
cut.
The
Iron
Throne
was
full
of
traps
for
the
unwary.
The
songs
said
it
had
taken
a
thousand
blades
to
make
it,
heated
white-hot
in
the
furnace
breath
of
Balerion
the
Black
Dread.
The
hammering
had
taken
fifty-nine
days.
The
end
of
it
was
this
hunched
black
beast
made
of
razor
edges
and
barbs
and
ribbons
of
sharp
metal;
a
chair
that
could
kill
a
man,
and
had,
if
the
stories
could
be
believed.

What
Eddard
Stark
was
doing
sitting
there
he
would
never
comprehend,
yet
there
he
sat,
and
these
people
looked
to
him
for
justice.
“What
proof
do
you
have
that
these
were
Lannisters?”
he
asked,
trying
to
keep
his
fury
under
control.
“Did
they
wear
crimson
cloaks
or
fly
a
lion
banner?”

“Even
Lannisters
are
not
so
blind
stupid
as
that,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
snapped.
He
was
a
swaggering
bantam
rooster
of
a
youth,
too
young
and
too
hot-blooded
for
Ned’s
taste,
though
a
fast
friend
of
Catelyn’s
brother,
Edmure
Tully.

“Every
man
among
them
was
mounted
and
mailed,
my
lord,”
Ser
Karyl
answered
calmly.
“They
were
armed
with
steel-tipped
lances
and
longswords,
with
battle-axes
for
the
butchering.”
He
gestured
toward
one
of
the
ragged
survivors.
“You.
Yes,
you,
no
one’s
going
to
hurt
you.
Tell
the
Hand
what
you
told
me.”

The
old
man
bobbed
his
head.
“Concerning
their
horses,”
he
said,
“it
were
warhorses
they
rode.
Many
a
year
I
worked
in
old
Ser
Willum’s
stables,
so
I
knows
the
difference.
Not
a
one
of
these
ever
pulled
a
plow,
gods
bear
witness
if
I’m
wrong.”

“Well-mounted
brigands,”
observed
Littlefinger.
“Perhaps
they
stole
the
horses
from
the
last
place
they
raided.”

“How
many
men
were
there
in
this
raiding
party?”
Ned
asked.

“A
hundred,
at
the
least,”
Joss
answered,
in
the
same
instant
as
the
bandaged
smith
said,
“Fifty,”
and
the
grandmother
behind
him,
“Hunnerds
and
hunnerds,
m’lord,
an
army
they
was.”

“You
are
more
right
than
you
know,
goodwoman,”
Lord
Eddard
told
her.
“You
say
they
flew
no
banners.
What
of
the
armor
they
wore?
Did
any
of
you
note
ornaments
or
decorations,
devices
on
shield
or
helm?”

The
brewer,
Joss,
shook
his
head.
“It
grieves
me,
m’lord,
but
no,
the
armor
they
showed
us
was
plain,
only…
the
one
who
led
them,
he
was
armored
like
the
rest,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
all
the
same.
It
was
the
size
of
him,
m’lord.
Those
as
say
the
giants
are
all
dead
never
saw
this
one,
I
swear.
Big
as
an
ox
he
was,
and
a
voice
like
stone
breaking.”

“The
Mountain!”
Ser
Marq
said
loudly.
“Can
any
man
doubt
it?
This
was
Gregor
Clegane’s
work.”

Ned
heard
muttering
from
beneath
the
windows
and
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
Even
in
the
galley,
nervous
whispers
were
exchanged.
High
lords
and
smallfolk
alike
knew
what
it
could
mean
if
Ser
Marq
was
proved
right.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
stood
bannerman
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister.

He
studied
the
frightened
faces
of
the
villagers.
Small
wonder
they
had
been
so
fearful;
they
had
thought
they
were
being
dragged
here
to
name
Lord
Tywin
a
red-handed
butcher
before
a
king
who
was
his
son
by
marriage.
He
wondered
if
the
knights
had
given
them
a
choice.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
rose
ponderously
from
the
council
table,
his
chain
of
office
clinking.
“Ser
Marq,
with
respect,
you
cannot
know
that
this
outlaw
was
Ser
Gregor.
There
are
many
large
men
in
the
realm.”

“As
large
as
the
Mountain
That
Rides?”
Ser
Karyl
said.
“I
have
never
met
one.”

“Nor
has
any
man
here,”
Ser
Raymun
added
hotly.
“Even
his
brother
is
a
pup
beside
him.
My
lords,
open
your
eyes.
Do
you
need
to
see
his
seal
on
the
corpses?
It
was
Gregor.”

“Why
should
Ser
Gregor
turn
brigand?”
Pycelle
asked.
“By
the
grace
of
his
liege
lord,
he
holds
a
stout
keep
and
lands
of
his
own.
The
man
is
an
anointed
knight.”

“A
false
knight!”
Ser
Marq
said.
“Lord
Tywin’s
mad
dog.”

“My
lord
Hand,”
Pycelle
declared
in
a
stiff
voice,
“I
urge
you
to
remind
this
good
knight
that
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
is
the
father
of
our
own
gracious
queen.”

“Thank
you,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,”
Ned
said.
“I
fear
we
might
have
forgotten
that
if
you
had
not
pointed
it
out.”

From
his
vantage
point
atop
the
throne,
he
could
see
men
slipping
out
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
Hares
going
to
ground,
he
supposed…
or
rats
off
to
nibble
the
queen’s
cheese.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
Septa
Mordane
in
the
gallery,
with
his
daughter
Sansa
beside
her.
Ned
felt
a
flash
of
anger;
this
was
no
place
for
a
girl.
But
the
septa
could
not
have
known
that
today’s
court
would
be
anything
but
the
usual
tedious
business
of
hearing
petitions,
settling
disputes
between
rival
holdfasts,
and
adjudicating
the
placement
of
boundary
stones.

At
the
council
table
below,
Petyr
Baelish
lost
interest
in
his
quill
and
leaned
forward.
“Ser
Marq,
Ser
Karyl,
Ser
Raymun—perhaps
I
might
ask
you
a
question?
These
holdfasts
were
under
your
protection.
Where
were
you
when
all
this
slaughtering
and
burning
was
going
on?”

Ser
Karyl
Vance
answered.
“I
was
attending
my
lord
father
in
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth,
as
was
Ser
Marq.
When
the
word
of
these
outrages
reached
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
he
sent
word
that
we
should
take
a
small
force
of
men
to
find
what
survivors
we
could
and
bring
them
to
the
king.”

Ser
Raymun
Darry
spoke
up.
“Ser
Edmure
had
summoned
me
to
Riverrun
with
all
my
strength.
I
was
camped
across
the
river
from
his
walls,
awaiting
his
commands,
when
the
word
reached
me.
By
the
time
I
could
return
to
my
own
lands,
Clegane
and
his
vermin
were
back
across
the
Red
Fork,
riding
for
Lannister’s
hills.”

Littlefinger
stroked
the
point
of
his
beard
thoughtfully.
“And
if
they
come
again,
ser?”

“If
they
come
again,
we’ll
use
their
blood
to
water
the
fields
they
burnt,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
declared
hotly.

“Ser
Edmure
has
sent
men
to
every
village
and
holdfast
within
a
day’s
ride
of
the
border,”
Ser
Karyl
explained.
“The
next
raider
will
not
have
such
an
easy
time
of
it.”

And
that
may
be
precisely
what
Lord
Tywin
wants,
Ned
thought
to
himself,
to
bleed
off
strength
from
Riverrun,
goad
the
boy
into
scattering
his
swords.
His
wife’s
brother
was
young,
and
more
gallant
than
wise.
He
would
try
to
hold
every
inch
of
his
soil,
to
defend
every
man,
woman,
and
child
who
named
him
lord,
and
Tywin
Lannister
was
shrewd
enough
to
know
that.

“If
your
fields
and
holdfasts
are
safe
from
harm,”
Lord
Petyr
was
saying,
“what
then
do
you
ask
of
the
throne?”

“The
lords
of
the
Trident
keep
the
king’s
peace,”
Ser
Raymun
Darry
said.
“The
Lannisters
have
broken
it.
We
ask
leave
to
answer
them,
steel
for
steel.
We
ask
justice
for
the
smallfolk
of
Sherrer
and
Wendish
Town
and
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

“Edmure
agrees,
we
must
pay
Gregor
Clegane
back
his
bloody
coin,”
Ser
Marq
declared,
“but
old
Lord
Hoster
commanded
us
to
come
here
and
beg
the
king’s
leave
before
we
strike.”

Thank
the
gods
for
old
Lord
Hoster,
then.
Tywin
Lannister
was
as
much
fox
as
lion.
If
indeed
he’d
sent
Ser
Gregor
to
burn
and
pillage—and
Ned
did
not
doubt
that
he
had—he’d
taken
care
to
see
that
he
rode
under
cover
of
night,
without
banners,
in
the
guise
of
a
common
brigand.
Should
Riverrun
strike
back,
Cersei
and
her
father
would
insist
that
it
had
been
the
Tullys
who
broke
the
king’s
peace,
not
the
Lannisters.
The
gods
only
knew
what
Robert
would
believe.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
on
his
feet
again.
“My
lord
Hand,
if
these
good
folk
believe
that
Ser
Gregor
has
forsaken
his
holy
vows
for
plunder
and
rape,
let
them
go
to
his
liege
lord
and
make
their
complaint.
These
crimes
are
no
concern
of
the
throne.
Let
them
seek
Lord
Tywin’s
justice.”

“It
is
all
the
king’s
justice,”
Ned
told
him.
“North,
south,
east,
or
west,
all
we
do
we
do
in
Robert’s
name.”

“The
king’s
justice,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“So
it
is,
and
so
we
should
defer
this
matter
until
the
king—”

“The
king
is
hunting
across
the
river
and
may
not
return
for
days,”
Lord
Eddard
said.
“Robert
bid
me
to
sit
here
in
his
place,
to
listen
with
his
ears,
and
to
speak
with
his
voice.
I
mean
to
do
just
that…
though
I
agree
that
he
must
be
told.”
He
saw
a
familiar
face
beneath
the
tapestries.
“Ser
Robar.”

Ser
Robar
Royce
stepped
forward
and
bowed.
“My
lord.”

“Your
father
is
hunting
with
the
king,”
Ned
said.
“Will
you
bring
them
word
of
what
was
said
and
done
here
today?”

“At
once,
my
lord.”

“Do
we
have
your
leave
to
take
our
vengeance
against
Ser
Gregor,
then?”
Marq
Piper
asked
the
throne.

“Vengeance?”
Ned
said.
“I
thought
we
were
speaking
of
justice.
Burning
Clegane’s
fields
and
slaughtering
his
people
will
not
restore
the
king’s
peace,
only
your
injured
pride.”
He
glanced
away
before
the
young
knight
could
voice
his
outraged
protest,
and
addressed
the
villagers.
“People
of
Sherrer,
I
cannot
give
you
back
your
homes
or
your
crops,
nor
can
I
restore
your
dead
to
life.
But
perhaps
I
can
give
you
some
small
measure
of
justice,
in
the
name
of
our
king,
Robert.”

Every
eye
in
the
hall
was
fixed
on
him,
waiting.
Slowly
Ned
struggled
to
his
feet,
pushing
himself
up
from
the
throne
with
the
strength
of
his
arms,
his
shattered
leg
screaming
inside
its
cast.
He
did
his
best
to
ignore
the
pain;
it
was
no
moment
to
let
them
see
his
weakness.
“The
First
Men
believed
that
the
judge
who
called
for
death
should
wield
the
sword,
and
in
the
north
we
hold
to
that
still.
I
mislike
sending
another
to
do
my
killing…
yet
it
seems
I
have
no
choice.”
He
gestured
at
his
broken
leg.

“Lord
Eddard!”
The
shout
came
from
the
west
side
of
the
hall
as
a
handsome
stripling
of
a
boy
strode
forth
boldly.
Out
of
his
armor,
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
looked
even
younger
than
his
sixteen
years.
He
wore
pale
blue
silk,
his
belt
a
linked
chain
of
golden
roses,
the
sigil
of
his
House.
“I
beg
you
the
honor
of
acting
in
your
place.
Give
this
task
to
me,
my
lord,
and
I
swear
I
shall
not
fail
you.”

Littlefinger
chuckled.
“Ser
Loras,
if
we
send
you
off
alone,
Ser
Gregor
will
send
us
back
your
head
with
a
plum
stuffed
in
that
pretty
mouth
of
yours.
The
Mountain
is
not
the
sort
to
bend
his
neck
to
any
man’s
justice.”

“I
do
not
fear
Gregor
Clegane,”
Ser
Loras
said
haughtily.

Ned
eased
himself
slowly
back
onto
the
hard
iron
seat
of
Aegon’s
misshapen
throne.
His
eyes
searched
the
faces
along
the
wall.
“Lord
Beric,”
he
called
out.
“Thoros
of
Myr.
Ser
Gladden.
Lord
Lothar.”
The
men
named
stepped
forward
one
by
one.
“Each
of
you
is
to
assemble
twenty
men,
to
bring
my
word
to
Gregor’s
keep.
Twenty
of
my
own
guards
shall
go
with
you.
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion,
you
shall
have
the
command,
as
befits
your
rank.”

The
young
lord
with
the
red-gold
hair
bowed.
“As
you
command,
Lord
Eddard.”

Ned
raised
his
voice,
so
it
carried
to
the
far
end
of
the
throne
room.
“In
the
name
of
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
by
the
word
of
Eddard
of
the
House
Stark,
his
Hand,
I
charge
you
to
ride
to
the
westlands
with
all
haste,
to
cross
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident
under
the
king’s
flag,
and
there
bring
the
king’s
justice
to
the
false
knight
Gregor
Clegane,
and
to
all
those
who
shared
in
his
crimes.
I
denounce
him,
and
attaint
him,
and
strip
him
of
all
rank
and
titles,
of
all
lands
and
incomes
and
holdings,
and
do
sentence
him
to
death.
May
the
gods
take
pity
on
his
soul.”

When
the
echo
of
his
words
had
died
away,
the
Knight
of
Flowers
seemed
perplexed.
“Lord
Eddard,
what
of
me?”

Ned
looked
down
on
him.
From
on
high,
Loras
Tyrell
seemed
almost
as
young
as
Robb.
“No
one
doubts
your
valor,
Ser
Loras,
but
we
are
about
justice
here,
and
what
you
seek
is
vengeance.”
He
looked
back
to
Lord
Beric.
“Ride
at
first
light.
These
things
are
best
done
quickly.”
He
held
up
a
hand.
“The
throne
will
hear
no
more
petitions
today.”

Alyn
and
Porther
climbed
the
steep
iron
steps
to
help
him
back
down.
As
they
made
their
descent,
he
could
feel
Loras
Tyrell’s
sullen
stare,
but
the
boy
had
stalked
away
before
Ned
reached
the
floor
of
the
throne
room.

At
the
base
of
the
Iron
Throne,
Varys
was
gathering
papers
from
the
council
table.
Littlefinger
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
already
taken
their
leave.
“You
are
a
bolder
man
than
I,
my
lord,”
the
eunuch
said
softly.

“How
so,
Lord
Varys?”
Ned
asked
brusquely.
His
leg
was
throbbing,
and
he
was
in
no
mood
for
word
games.

“Had
it
been
me
up
there,
I
should
have
sent
Ser
Loras.
He
so
wanted
to
go…
and
a
man
who
has
the
Lannisters
for
his
enemies
would
do
well
to
make
the
Tyrells
his
friends.”

“Ser
Loras
is
young,”
said
Ned.
“I
daresay
he
will
outgrow
the
disappointment.”

“And
Ser
Ilyn?”
The
eunuch
stroked
a
plump,
powdered
cheek.
“He
is
the
King’s
Justice,
after
all.
Sending
other
men
to
do
his
office…
some
might
construe
that
as
a
grave
insult.”

“No
slight
was
intended.”
In
truth,
Ned
did
not
trust
the
mute
knight,
though
perhaps
that
was
only
because
he
misliked
executioners.
“I
remind
you,
the
Paynes
are
bannermen
to
House
Lannister.
I
thought
it
best
to
choose
men
who
owed
Lord
Tywin
no
fealty.”

“Very
prudent,
no
doubt,”
Varys
said.
“Still,
I
chanced
to
see
Ser
Ilyn
in
the
back
of
the
hall,
staring
at
us
with
those
pale
eyes
of
his,
and
I
must
say,
he
did
not
look
pleased,
though
to
be
sure
it
is
hard
to
tell
with
our
silent
knight.
I
hope
he
outgrows
his
disappointment
as
well.
He
does
so
love
his
work…”





SANSA

“He
wouldn’t
send
Ser
Loras,”
Sansa
told
Jeyne
Poole
that
night
as
they
shared
a
cold
supper
by
lamplight.
“I
think
it
was
because
of
his
leg.”

Lord
Eddard
had
taken
his
supper
in
his
bedchamber
with
Alyn,
Harwin,
and
Vayon
Poole,
the
better
to
rest
his
broken
leg,
and
Septa
Mordane
had
complained
of
sore
feet
after
standing
in
the
gallery
all
day.
Arya
was
supposed
to
join
them,
but
she
was
late
coming
back
from
her
dancing
lesson.

“His
leg?”
Jeyne
said
uncertainly.
She
was
a
pretty,
dark-haired
girl
of
Sansa’s
own
age.
“Did
Ser
Loras
hurt
his
leg?”

“Not
his
leg,”
Sansa
said,
nibbling
delicately
at
a
chicken
leg.
“Father’s
leg,
silly.
It
hurts
him
ever
so
much,
it
makes
him
cross.
Otherwise
I’m
certain
he
would
have
sent
Ser
Loras.”

Her
father’s
decision
still
bewildered
her.
When
the
Knight
of
Flowers
had
spoken
up,
she’d
been
sure
she
was
about
to
see
one
of
Old
Nan’s
stories
come
to
life.
Ser
Gregor
was
the
monster
and
Ser
Loras
the
true
hero
who
would
slay
him.
He
even
looked
a
true
hero,
so
slim
and
beautiful,
with
golden
roses
around
his
slender
waist
and
his
rich
brown
hair
tumbling
down
into
his
eyes.
And
then
Father
had
refused
him!
It
had
upset
her
more
than
she
could
tell.
She
had
said
as
much
to
Septa
Mordane
as
they
descended
the
stairs
from
the
gallery,
but
the
septa
had
only
told
her
it
was
not
her
place
to
question
her
lord
father’s
decisions.

That
was
when
Lord
Baelish
had
said,
“Oh,
I
don’t
know,
Septa.
Some
of
her
lord
father’s
decisions
could
do
with
a
bit
of
questioning.
The
young
lady
is
as
wise
as
she
is
lovely.”
He
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
Sansa,
so
deep
she
was
not
quite
sure
if
she
was
being
complimented
or
mocked.

Septa
Mordane
had
been
very
upset
to
realize
that
Lord
Baelish
had
overheard
them.
“The
girl
was
just
talking,
my
lord,”
she’d
said.
“Foolish
chatter.
She
meant
nothing
by
the
comment.”

Lord
Baelish
stroked
his
little
pointed
beard
and
said,
“Nothing?
Tell
me,
child,
why
would
you
have
sent
Ser
Loras?”

Sansa
had
no
choice
but
to
explain
about
heroes
and
monsters.
The
king’s
councillor
smiled.
“Well,
those
are
not
the
reasons
I’d
have
given,
but…”
He
had
touched
her
cheek,
his
thumb
lightly
tracing
the
line
of
a
cheekbone.
“Life
is
not
a
song,
sweetling.
You
may
learn
that
one
day
to
your
sorrow.”

Sansa
did
not
feel
like
telling
all
that
to
Jeyne,
however;
it
made
her
uneasy
just
to
think
back
on
it.

“Ser
Ilyn’s
the
King’s
Justice,
not
Ser
Loras,”
Jcyne
said.
“Lord
Eddard
should
have
sent
him.”

Sansa
shuddered.
Every
time
she
looked
at
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
she
shivered.
He
made
her
feel
as
though
something
dead
were
slithering
over
her
naked
skin.
“Ser
Ilyn’s
almost
like
a
second
monster.
I’m
glad
Father
didn’t
pick
him.”

“Lord
Beric
is
as
much
a
hero
as
Ser
Loras.
He’s
ever
so
brave
and
gallant.”

“I
suppose,”
Sansa
said
doubtfully.
Beric
Dondarrion
was
handsome
enough,
but
he
was
awfully
old,
almost
twenty-two;
the
Knight
of
Flowers
would
have
been
much
better.
Of
course,
Jeyne
had
been
in
love
with
Lord
Beric
ever
since
she
had
first
glimpsed
him
in
the
lists.
Sansa
thought
she
was
being
silly;
Jeyne
was
only
a
steward’s
daughter,
after
all,
and
no
matter
how
much
she
mooned
after
him,
Lord
Beric
would
never
look
at
someone
so
far
beneath
him,
even
if
she
hadn’t
been
half
his
age.

It
would
have
been
unkind
to
say
so,
however,
so
Sansa
took
a
sip
of
milk
and
changed
the
subject.
“I
had
a
dream
that
Joffrey
would
be
the
one
to
take
the
white
hart,”
she
said.
It
had
been
more
of
a
wish,
actually,
but
it
sounded
better
to
call
it
a
dream.
Everyone
knew
that
dreams
were
prophetic.
White
harts
were
supposed
to
be
very
rare
and
magical,
and
in
her
heart
she
knew
her
gallant
prince
was
worthier
than
his
drunken
father.

“A
dream?
Truly?
Did
Prince
Joffrey
just
go
up
to
it
and
touch
it
with
his
bare
hand
and
do
it
no
harm?”

“No,”
Sansa
said.
“He
shot
it
with
a
golden
arrow
and
brought
it
back
for
me.”
In
the
songs,
the
knights
never
killed
magical
beasts,
they
just
went
up
to
them
and
touched
them
and
did
them
no
harm,
but
she
knew
Joffrey
liked
hunting,
especially
the
killing
part.
Only
animals,
though.
Sansa
was
certain
her
prince
had
no
part
in
murdering
Jory
and
those
other
poor
men;
that
had
been
his
wicked
uncle,
the
Kingslayer.
She
knew
her
father
was
still
angry
about
that,
but
it
wasn’t
fair
to
blame
Joff.
That
would
be
like
blaming
her
for
something
that
Arya
had
done.

“I
saw
your
sister
this
afternoon,”
Jeyne
blurted
out,
as
if
she’d
been
reading
Sansa’s
thoughts.
“She
was
walking
through
the
stables
on
her
hands.
Why
would
she
do
a
thing
like
that?”

“I’m
sure
I
don’t
know
why
Arya
does
anything.”
Sansa
hated
stables,
smelly
places
full
of
manure
and
flies.
Even
when
she
went
riding,
she
liked
the
boy
to
saddle
the
horse
and
bring
it
to
her
in
the
yard.
“Do
you
want
to
hear
about
the
court
or
not?”

“I
do,”
Jeyne
said.

“There
was
a
black
brother,”
Sansa
said,
“begging
men
for
the
Wall,
only
he
was
kind
of
old
and
smelly.”
She
hadn’t
liked
that
at
all.
She
had
always
imagined
the
Night’s
Watch
to
be
men
like
Uncle
Benjen.
In
the
songs,
they
were
called
the
black
knights
of
the
Wall.
But
this
man
had
been
crookbacked
and
hideous,
and
he
looked
as
though
he
might
have
lice.
If
this
was
what
the
Night’s
Watch
was
truly
like,
she
felt
sorry
for
her
bastard
half
brother,
Jon.
“Father
asked
if
there
were
any
knights
in
the
hall
who
would
do
honor
to
their
houses
by
taking
the
black,
but
no
one
came
forward,
so
he
gave
this
Yoren
his
pick
of
the
king’s
dungeons
and
sent
him
on
his
way.
And
later
these
two
brothers
came
before
him,
freeriders
from
the
Dornish
Marches,
and
pledged
their
swords
to
the
service
of
the
king.
Father
accepted
their
oaths…”

Jeyne
yawned.
“Are
there
any
lemon
cakes?”

Sansa
did
not
like
being
interrupted,
but
she
had
to
admit,
lemon
cakes
sounded
more
interesting
than
most
of
what
had
gone
on
in
the
throne
room.
“Let’s
see,”
she
said.

The
kitchen
yielded
no
lemon
cakes,
but
they
did
find
half
of
a
cold
strawberry
pie,
and
that
was
almost
as
good.
They
ate
it
on
the
tower
steps,
giggling
and
gossiping
and
sharing
secrets,
and
Sansa
went
to
bed
that
night
feeling
almost
as
wicked
as
Arya.

The
next
morning
she
woke
before
first
light
and
crept
sleepily
to
her
window
to
watch
Lord
Beric
form
up
his
men.
They
rode
out
as
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
city,
with
three
banners
going
before
them;
the
crowned
stag
of
the
king
flew
from
the
high
staff,
the
direwolf
of
Stark
and
Lord
Beric’s
own
forked
lightning
standard
from
shorter
poles.
It
was
all
so
exciting,
a
song
come
to
life;
the
clatter
of
swords,
the
flicker
of
torchlight,
banners
dancing
in
the
wind,
horses
snorting
and
whinnying,
the
golden
glow
of
sunrise
slanting
through
the
bars
of
the
portcullis
as
it
jerked
upward.
The
Winterfell
men
looked
especially
fine
in
their
silvery
mail
and
long
grey
cloaks.

Alyn
carried
the
Stark
banner.
When
she
saw
him
rein
in
beside
Lord
Beric
to
exchange
words,
it
made
Sansa
feel
ever
so
proud.
Alyn
was
handsomer
than
Jory
had
been;
he
was
going
to
be
a
knight
one
day.

The
Tower
of
the
Hand
seemed
so
empty
after
they
left
that
Sansa
was
even
pleased
to
see
Arya
when
she
went
down
to
break
her
fast.
“Where
is
everyone?”
her
sister
wanted
to
know
as
she
ripped
the
skin
from
a
blood
orange.
“Did
Father
send
them
to
hunt
down
Jaime
Lannister?”

Sansa
sighed.
“They
rode
with
Lord
Beric,
to
behead
Ser
Gregor
Clegane.”
She
turned
to
Septa
Mordane,
who
was
eating
porridge
with
a
wooden
spoon.
“Septa,
will
Lord
Beric
spike
Ser
Gregor’s
head
on
his
own
gate
or
bring
it
back
here
for
the
king?”
She
and
Jeyne
Poole
had
been
arguing
over
that
last
night.

The
septa
was
horror-struck.
“A
lady
does
not
discuss
such
things
over
her
porridge.
Where
are
your
courtesies,
Sansa?
I
swear,
of
late
you’ve
been
near
as
bad
as
your
sister.”

“What
did
Gregor
do?”
Arya
asked.

“He
burned
down
a
holdfast
and
murdered
a
lot
of
people,
women
and
children
too.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face
in
a
scowl.
“Jaime
Lannister
murdered
Jory
and
Heward
and
Wyl,
and
the
Hound
murdered
Mycah.
Somebody
should
have
beheaded
them.”

“It’s
not
the
same,”
Sansa
said.
“The
Hound
is
Joffrey’s
sworn
shield.
Your
butcher’s
boy
attacked
the
prince.”

“Liar,”
Arya
said.
Her
hand
clenched
the
blood
orange
so
hard
that
red
juice
oozed
between
her
fingers.

“Go
ahead,
call
me
all
the
names
you
want,”
Sansa
said
airily.
“You
won’t
dare
when
I’m
married
to
Joffrey.
You’ll
have
to
bow
to
me
and
call
me
Your
Grace.”
She
shrieked
as
Arya
flung
the
orange
across
the
table.
It
caught
her
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
with
a
wet
squish
and
plopped
down
into
her
lap.

“You
have
juice
on
your
face,
Your
Grace,”
Arya
said.

It
was
running
down
her
nose
and
stinging
her
eyes.
Sansa
wiped
it
away
with
a
napkin.
When
she
saw
what
the
fruit
in
her
lap
had
done
to
her
beautiful
ivory
silk
dress,
she
shrieked
again.
“You’re
horrible,”
she
screamed
at
her
sister.
“They
should
have
killed
you
instead
of
Lady!”

Septa
Mordane
came
lurching
to
her
feet.
“Your
lord
father
will
hear
of
this!
Go
to
your
chambers,
at
once.
At
once!”

“Me
too?”
Tears
welled
in
Sansa’s
eyes.
“That’s
not
fair.”

“The
matter
is
not
subject
to
discussion.
Go!”

Sansa
stalked
away
with
her
head
up.
She
was
to
be
a
queen,
and
queens
did
not
cry.
At
least
not
where
people
could
see.
When
she
reached
her
bedchamber,
she
barred
the
door
and
took
off
her
dress.
The
blood
orange
had
left
a
blotchy
red
stain
on
the
silk.
“I
hate
her!”
she
screamed.
She
balled
up
the
dress
and
flung
it
into
the
cold
hearth,
on
top
of
the
ashes
of
last
night’s
fire.
When
she
saw
that
the
stain
had
bled
through
onto
her
underskirt,
she
began
to
sob
despite
herself.
She
ripped
off
the
rest
of
her
clothes
wildly,
threw
herself
into
bed,
and
cried
herself
back
to
sleep.

It
was
midday
when
Septa
Mordane
knocked
upon
her
door.
“Sansa.
Your
lord
father
will
see
you
now.”

Sansa
sat
up.
“Lady,”
she
whispered.
For
a
moment
it
was
as
if
the
direwolf
was
there
in
the
room,
looking
at
her
with
those
golden
eyes,
sad
and
knowing.
She
had
been
dreaming,
she
realized.
Lady
was
with
her,
and
they
were
running
together,
and…
and…
trying
to
remember
was
like
trying
to
catch
the
rain
with
her
fingers.
The
dream
faded,
and
Lady
was
dead
again.

“Sansa.”
The
rap
came
again,
sharply.
“Do
you
hear
me?”

“Yes,
Septa,”
she
called
out.
“Might
I
have
a
moment
to
dress,
please?”
Her
eyes
were
red
from
crying,
but
she
did
her
best
to
make
herself
beautiful.

Lord
Eddard
was
bent
over
a
huge
leather-bound
book
when
Septa
Mordane
marched
her
into
the
solar,
his
plaster-wrapped
leg
stiff
beneath
the
table.
“Come
here,
Sansa,”
he
said,
not
unkindly,
when
the
septa
had
gone
for
her
sister.
“Sit
beside
me.”
He
closed
the
book.

Septa
Mordane
returned
with
Arya
squirming
in
her
grasp.
Sansa
had
put
on
a
lovely
pale
green
damask
gown
and
a
look
of
remorse,
but
her
sister
was
still
wearing
the
ratty
leathers
and
roughspun
she’d
worn
at
breakfast.
“Here
is
the
other
one,”
the
septa
announced.

“My
thanks,
Septa
Mordane.
I
would
talk
to
my
daughters
alone,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”
The
septa
bowed
and
left.

“Arya
started
it,”
Sansa
said
quickly,
anxious
to
have
the
first
word.
“She
called
me
a
liar
and
threw
an
orange
at
me
and
spoiled
my
dress,
the
ivory
silk,
the
one
Queen
Cersei
gave
me
when
I
was
betrothed
to
Prince
Joffrey.
She
hates
that
I’m
going
to
marry
the
prince.
She
tries
to
spoil
everything,
Father,
she
can’t
stand
for
anything
to
be
beautiful
or
nice
or
splendid.”

“Enough,
Sansa.”
Lord
Eddard’s
voice
was
sharp
with
impatience.

Arya
raised
her
eyes.
“I’m
sorry,
Father.
I
was
wrong
and
I
beg
my
sweet
sister’s
forgiveness.”

Sansa
was
so
startled
that
for
a
moment
she
was
speechless.
Finally
she
found
her
voice.
“What
about
my
dress?”

“Maybe…
I
could
wash
it,”
Arya
said
doubtfully.

“Washing
won’t
do
any
good,”
Sansa
said.
“Not
if
you
scrubbed
all
day
and
all
night.
The
silk
is
ruined.”

“Then
I’ll…
make
you
a
new
one,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
threw
back
her
head
in
disdain.
“You?
You
couldn’t
sew
a
dress
fit
to
clean
the
pigsties.”

Their
father
sighed.
“I
did
not
call
you
here
to
talk
of
dresses.
I’m
sending
you
both
back
to
Winterfell.”

For
the
second
time
Sansa
found
herself
too
stunned
for
words.
She
felt
her
eyes
grow
moist
again.

“You
can’t,”
Arya
said.

“Please,
Father,”
Sansa
managed
at
last.
“Please
don’t.”

Eddard
Stark
favored
his
daughters
with
a
tired
smile.
“At
last
we’ve
found
something
you
agree
on.”

“I
didn’t
do
anything
wrong,”
Sansa
pleaded
with
him.
“I
don’t
want
to
go
back.”
She
loved
Mng’s
Landing;
the
pagaentry
of
the
court,
the
high
lords
and
ladies
in
their
velvets
and
silks
and
gemstones,
the
great
city
with
all
its
people.
The
tournament
had
been
the
most
magical
time
of
her
whole
life,
and
there
was
so
much
she
had
not
seen
yet,
harvest
feasts
and
masked
balls
and
mummer
shows.
She
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
losing
it
all.
“Send
Arya
away,
she
started
it,
Father,
I
swear
it.
I’ll
be
good,
you’ll
see,
just
let
me
stay
and
I
promise
to
be
as
fine
and
noble
and
courteous
as
the
queen.”

Father’s
mouth
twitched
strangely.
“Sansa,
I’m
not
sending
you
away
for
fighting,
though
the
gods
know
I’m
sick
of
you
two
squabbling.
I
want
you
back
in
Winterfell
for
your
own
safety.
Three
of
my
men
were
cut
down
like
dogs
not
a
league
from
where
we
sit,
and
what
does
Robert
do?
He
goes
hunting.”

Arya
was
chewing
at
her
lip
in
that
disgusting
way
she
had.
“Can
we
take
Syrio
back
with
us?”

“Who
cares
about
your
stupid
dancing
master?”
Sansa
flared.
“Father,
I
only
just
now
remembered,
I
can’t
go
away,
I’m
to
marry
Prince
Joffrey.”
She
tried
to
smile
bravely
for
him.
“I
love
him,
Father,
I
truly
truly
do,
I
love
him
as
much
as
Queen
Naerys
loved
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
as
much
as
Jonquil
loved
Ser
Florian.
I
want
to
be
his
queen
and
have
his
babies.”

“Sweet
one,”
her
father
said
gently,
“listen
to
me.
When
you’re
old
enough,
I
will
make
you
a
match
with
a
high
lord
who’s
worthy
of
you,
someone
brave
and
gentle
and
strong.
This
match
with
Joffrey
was
a
terrible
mistake.
That
boy
is
no
Prince
Aemon,
you
must
believe
me.”

“He
is!”
Sansa
insisted.
“I
don’t
want
someone
brave
and
gentle,
I
want
him.
We’ll
be
ever
so
happy,
just
like
in
the
songs,
you’ll
see.
I’ll
give
him
a
son
with
golden
hair,
and
one
day
he’ll
be
the
king
of
all
the
realm,
the
greatest
king
that
ever
was,
as
brave
as
the
wolf
and
as
proud
as
the
lion.”

Arya
made
a
face.
“Not
if
Joffrey’s
his
father,”
she
said.
“He’s
a
liar
and
a
craven
and
anyhow
he’s
a
stag,
not
a
lion.”

Sansa
felt
tears
in
her
eyes.
“He
is
not!
He’s
not
the
least
bit
like
that
old
drunken
king,”
she
screamed
at
her
sister,
forgetting
herself
in
her
grief.

Father
looked
at
her
strangely.
“Gods,”
he
swore
softly,
“out
of
the
mouth
of
babes…”
He
shouted
for
Septa
Mordane.
To
the
girls
he
said,
“I
am
looking
for
a
fast
trading
galley
to
take
you
home.
These
days,
the
sea
is
safer
than
the
kingsroad.
You
will
sail
as
soon
as
I
can
find
a
proper
ship,
with
Septa
Mordane
and
a
complement
of
guards…
and
yes,
with
Syrio
Forel,
if
he
agrees
to
enter
my
service.
But
say
nothing
of
this.
It’s
better
if
no
one
knows
of
our
plans.
We’ll
talk
again
tomorrow.”

Sansa
cried
as
Septa
Mordane
marched
them
down
the
steps.
They
were
going
to
take
it
all
away;
the
tournaments
and
the
court
and
her
prince,
everything,
they
were
going
to
send
her
back
to
the
bleak
grey
walls
of
Winterfell
and
lock
her
up
forever.
Her
life
was
over
before
it
had
begun.

“Stop
that
weeping,
child,”
Septa
Mordane
said
sternly.
“I
am
certain
your
lord
father
knows
what
is
best
for
you.”

“It
won’t
be
so
bad,
Sansa,”
Arya
said.
“We’re
going
to
sail
on
a
galley.
It
will
be
an
adventure,
and
then
we’ll
be
with
Bran
and
Robb
again,
and
Old
Nan
and
Hodor
and
the
rest.”
She
touched
her
on
the
arm.

“Hodor!”
Sansa
yelled.
“You
ought
to
marry
Hodor,
you’re
just
like
him,
stupid
and
hairy
and
ugly!”
She
wrenched
away
from
her
sister’s
hand,
stormed
into
her
bedchamber,
and
barred
the
door
behind
her.

JON

The
call
came
drifting
through
the
black
of
night.
Jon
pushed
himself
onto
an
elbow,
his
hand
reaching
for
Longclaw
by
force
of
habit
as
the
camp
began
to
stir.
The
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
he
thought.

The
long
low
note
lingered
at
the
edge
of
hearing.
The
sentries
at
the
ringwall
stood
still
in
their
footsteps,
breath
frosting
and
heads
turned
toward
the
west.
As
the
sound
of
the
horn
faded,
even
the
wind
ceased
to
blow.
Men
rolled
from
their
blankets
and
reached
for
spears
and
swordbelts,
moving
quietly,
listening.
A
horse
whickered
and
was
hushed.
For
a
heartbeat
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
forest
were
holding
its
breath.
The
brothers
of
the
Night’s
Watch
waited
for
a
second
blast,
praying
they
should
not
hear
it,
fearing
that
they
would.

When
the
silence
had
stretched
unbearably
long
and
the
men
knew
at
last
that
the
horn
would
not
wind
again,
they
grinned
at
one
another
sheepishly,
as
if
to
deny
that
they
had
been
anxious.
Jon
Snow
fed
a
few
sticks
to
the
fire,
buckled
on
his
swordbelt,
pulled
on
his
boots,
shook
the
dirt
and
dew
from
the
cloak,
and
fastened
it
around
his
shoulders.
The
flames
blazed
up
beside
him,
welcome
heat
beating
against
his
face
as
he
dressed.
He
could
hear
the
Lord
Commander
moving
inside
the
tent.
After
a
moment
Mormont
lifted
the
flap.
“One
blast?”
On
his
shoulder,
his
raven
sat
fluffed
and
silent,
looking
miserable.

“One,
my
lord,”
Jon
agreed.
“Brothers
returning.”

Mormont
moved
to
the
fire.
“The
Halfhand.
And
past
time.”
He
had
grown
more
restive
every
day
they
waited;
much
longer
and
he
would
have
been
fit
to
whelp
cubs.
“See
that
there’s
hot
food
for
the
men
and
fodder
for
the
horses.
I’ll
see
Qhorin
at
once.”

“I’ll
bring
him,
my
lord.”
The
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower
had
been
expected
days
ago.
When
they
had
not
appeared,
the
brothers
had
begun
to
wonder.
Jon
had
heard
gloomy
mutterings
around
the
cookfire,
and
not
just
from
Dolorous
Edd.
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
was
for
retreating
to
Castle
Black
as
soon
as
possible.
Ser
Mallador
Locke
would
strike
for
the
Shadow
Tower,
hoping
to
pick
up
Qhorin’s
trail
and
learn
what
had
befallen
him.
And
Thoren
Smallwood
wanted
to
push
on
into
the
mountains.
“Mance
Rayder
knows
he
must
battle
the
Watch,”
Thoren
had
declared,
“but
he
will
never
look
for
us
so
far
north.
If
we
ride
up
the
Milkwater,
we
can
take
him
unawares
and
cut
his
host
to
ribbons
before
he
knows
we
are
on
him.”

“The
numbers
would
be
greatly
against
us,”
Ser
Ottyn
had
objected.
“Craster
said
he
was
gathering
a
great
host.
Many
thousands.
Without
Qhorin,
we
are
only
two
hundred.”

“Send
two
hundred
wolves
against
ten
thousand
sheep,
ser,
and
see
what
happens,”
said
Smallwood
confidently.

“There
are
goats
among
these
sheep,
Thoren,”
warned
Jarman
Buckwell.
“Aye,
and
maybe
a
few
lions.
Rattleshirt,
Harma
the
Dogshead,
Alfyn
Crowkiller…”

“I
know
them
as
well
as
you
do,
Buckwell,”
Thoren
Smallwood
snapped
back.
“And
I
mean
to
have
their
heads,
every
one.
These
are
wildlings.
No
soldiers.
A
few
hundred
heroes,
drunk
most
like,
amidst
a
great
horde
of
women,
children,
and
thralls.
We
will
sweep
over
them
and
send
them
howling
back
to
their
hovels.”

They
had
argued
for
many
hours,
and
reached
no
agreement.
The
Old
Bear
was
too
stubborn
to
retreat,
but
neither
would
he
rush
headlong
up
the
Milkwater,
seeking
battle.
In
the
end,
nothing
had
been
decided
but
to
wait
a
few
more
days
for
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower,
and
talk
again
if
they
did
not
appear.

And
now
they
had,
which
meant
that
the
decision
could
be
delayed
no
longer.
Jon
was
glad
of
that
much,
at
least.
If
they
must
battle
Mance
Rayder,
let
it
be
soon.

He
found
Dolorous
Edd
at
the
fire,
complaining
about
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
sleep
when
people
insisted
on
blowing
horns
in
the
woods.
Jon
gave
him
something
new
to
complain
about.
Together
they
woke
Hake,
who
received
the
Lord
Commander’s
orders
with
a
stream
of
curses,
but
got
up
all
the
same
and
soon
had
a
dozen
brothers
cutting
roots
for
a
soup.

Sam
came
puffing
up
as
Jon
crossed
the
camp.
Under
the
black
hood
his
face
was
as
pale
and
round
as
the
moon.
“I
heard
the
horn.
Has
your
uncle
come
back?”

“It’s
only
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower.”
It
was
growing
harder
to
cling
to
the
hope
of
Benjen
Stark’s
safe
return.
The
cloak
he
had
found
beneath
the
Fist
could
well
have
belonged
to
his
uncle
or
one
of
his
men,
even
the
Old
Bear
admitted
as
much,
though
why
they
would
have
buried
it
there,
wrapped
around
the
cache
of
dragonglass,
no
one
could
say.
“Sam,
I
have
to
go.”

At
the
ringwall,
he
found
the
guards
sliding
spikes
from
the
half-frozen
earth
to
make
an
opening.
It
was
not
long
until
the
first
of
the
brothers
from
the
Shadow
Tower
began
wending
their
way
up
the
slope.
All
in
leather
and
fur
they
were,
with
here
and
there
a
bit
of
steel
or
bronze;
heavy
beards
covered
hard
lean
faces,
and
made
them
look
as
shaggy
as
their
garrons.
Jon
was
surprised
to
see
some
of
them
were
riding
two
to
a
horse.
When
he
looked
more
closely,
it
was
plain
that
many
of
them
were
wounded.
There
has
been
trouble
on
the
way.

Jon
knew
Qhorin
Halfhand
the
instant
he
saw
him,
though
they
had
never
met.
The
big
ranger
was
half
a
legend
in
the
Watch;
a
man
of
slow
words
and
swift
action,
tall
and
straight
as
a
spear,
long-limbed
and
solemn.
Unlike
his
men,
he
was
clean-shaven.
His
hair
fell
from
beneath
his
helm
in
a
heavy
braid
touched
with
hoarfrost,
and
the
blacks
he
wore
were
so
faded
they
might
have
been
greys.
Only
thumb
and
forefinger
remained
on
the
hand
that
held
the
reins;
the
other
fingers
had
been
sheared
off
catching
a
wildling’s
axe
that
would
otherwise
have
split
his
skull.
It
was
told
that
he
had
thrust
his
maimed
fist
into
the
face
of
the
axeman
so
the
blood
spurted
into
his
eyes,
and
slew
him
while
he
was
blind.
Since
that
day,
the
wildlings
beyond
the
Wall
had
known
no
foe
more
implacable.

Jon
hailed
him.
“Lord
Commander
Mormont
would
see
you
at
once.
I’ll
show
you
to
his
tent.”

Qhorin
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
“My
men
are
hungry,
and
our
horses
require
tending.”

“They’ll
all
be
seen
to.”

The
ranger
gave
his
horse
into
the
care
of
one
of
his
men
and
followed.
“You
are
Jon
Snow.
You
have
your
father’s
look.”

“Did
you
know
him,
my
lord?”

“I
am
no
lordling.
Only
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
I
knew
Lord
Eddard,
yes.
And
his
father
before
him.”

Jon
had
to
hurry
his
steps
to
keep
up
with
Qhorin’s
long
strides.
“Lord
Rickard
died
before
I
was
born.”

“He
was
a
friend
to
the
Watch.”
Qhorin
glanced
behind.
“It
is
said
that
a
direwolf
runs
with
you.”

“Ghost
should
be
back
by
dawn.
He
hunts
at
night.”

They
found
Dolorous
Edd
frying
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
boiling
a
dozen
eggs
in
a
kettle
over
the
Old
Bear’s
cookfire.
Mormont
sat
in
his
wood-and-leather
camp
chair.
“I
had
begun
to
fear
for
you.
Did
you
meet
with
trouble?”

“We
met
with
Alfyn
Crowkiller.
Mance
had
sent
him
to
scout
along
the
Wall,
and
we
chanced
on
him
returning.”
Qhorin
removed
his
helm.
“Alfyn
will
trouble
the
realm
no
longer,
but
some
of
his
company
escaped
us.
We
hunted
down
as
many
as
we
could,
but
it
may
be
that
a
few
will
win
back
to
the
mountains.”

“And
the
cost?”

“Four
brothers
dead.
A
dozen
wounded.
A
third
as
many
as
the
foe.
And
we
took
captives.
One
died
quickly
from
his
wounds,
but
the
other
lived
long
enough
to
be
questioned.”

“Best
talk
of
this
inside.
Jon
will
fetch
you
a
horn
of
ale.
Or
would
you
prefer
hot
spiced
wine?”

“Boiled
water
will
suffice.
An
egg
and
a
bite
of
bacon.”

“As
you
wish.”
Mormont
lifted
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
stooped
and
stepped
through.

Edd
stood
over
the
kettle
swishing
the
eggs
about
with
a
spoon.
“I
envy
those
eggs,”
he
said.
“I
could
do
with
a
bit
of
boiling
about
now.
If
the
kettle
were
larger,
I
might
jump
in.
Though
I
would
sooner
it
were
wine
than
water.
There
are
worse
ways
to
die
than
warm
and
drunk.
I
knew
a
brother
drowned
himself
in
wine
once.
It
was
a
poor
vintage,
though,
and
his
corpse
did
not
improve
it.”

“You
drank
the
wine?”

“It’s
an
awful
thing
to
find
a
brother
dead.
You’d
have
need
of
a
drink
as
well,
Lord
Snow.”
Edd
stirred
the
kettle
and
added
a
pinch
more
nutmeg.

Restless,
Jon
squatted
by
the
fire
and
poked
at
it
with
a
stick.
He
could
hear
the
Old
Bear’s
voice
inside
the
tent,
punctuated
by
the
raven’s
squawks
and
Qhorin
Halfhand’s
quieter
tones,
but
he
could
not
make
out
the
words.
Alfyn
Crowkiller
dead,
that’s
good.
He
was
one
of
the
bloodiest
of
the
wildling
raiders,
taking
his
name
from
the
black
brothers
he’d
slain.
So
why
does
Qhorin
sound
so
grave,
after
such
a
victory?

Jon
had
hoped
that
the
arrival
of
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower
would
lift
the
spirits
in
the
camp.
Only
last
night,
he
was
coming
back
through
the
dark
from
a
piss
when
he
heard
five
or
six
men
talking
in
low
voices
around
the
embers
of
a
fire.
When
he
heard
Chett
muttering
that
it
was
past
time
they
turned
back,
Jon
stopped
to
listen.
“It’s
an
old
man’s
folly,
this
ranging,”
he
heard.
“We’ll
find
nothing
but
our
graves
in
them
mountains.”

“There’s
giants
in
the
Frostfangs,
and
wargs,
and
worse
things,”
said
Lark
the
Sisterman.

“I’ll
not
be
going
there,
I
promise
you.”

“The
Old
Bear’s
not
like
to
give
you
a
choice.”

“Might
be
we
won’t
give
him
one,”
said
Chett.

Just
then
one
of
the
dogs
had
raised
his
head
and
growled,
and
he
had
to
move
away
quickly,
before
he
was
seen.
I
was
not
meant
to
hear
that,
he
thought.
He
considered
taking
the
tale
to
Mormont,
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
inform
on
his
brothers,
even
brothers
such
as
Chett
and
the
Sisterman.
It
was
just
empty
talk,
he
told
himself.
They
are
cold
and
afraid,
we
all
are.
It
was
hard
waiting
here,
perched
on
the
stony
summit
above
the
forest,
wondering
what
the
morrow
might
bring.
The
unseen
enemy
is
always
the
most
fearsome.

Jon
slid
his
new
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
studied
the
flames
as
they
played
against
the
shiny
black
glass.
He
had
fashioned
the
wooden
hilt
himself,
and
wound
hempen
twine
around
it
to
make
a
grip.
Ugly,
but
it
served.
Dolorous
Edd
opined
that
glass
knives
were
about
as
useful
as
nipples
on
a
knight’s
breastplate,
but
Jon
was
not
so
certain.
The
dragonglass
blade
was
sharper
than
steel,
albeit
far
more
brittle.

It
must
have
been
buried
for
a
reason.

He
had
made
a
dagger
for
Grenn
as
well,
and
another
for
the
Lord
Commander.
The
warhorn
he
had
given
to
Sam.
On
closer
examination
the
horn
had
proved
cracked,
and
even
after
he
had
cleaned
all
the
dirt
out,
Jon
had
been
unable
to
get
any
sound
from
it.
The
rim
was
chipped
as
well,
but
Sam
liked
old
things,
even
worthless
old
things.
“Make
a
drinking
horn
out
of
it,”
Jon
told
him,
“and
every
time
you
take
a
drink
you’ll
remember
how
you
ranged
beyond
the
Wall,
all
the
way
to
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men.”
He
gave
Sam
a
spearhead
and
a
dozen
arrowheads
as
well,
and
passed
the
rest
out
among
his
other
friends
for
luck.

The
Old
Bear
had
seemed
pleased
by
the
dagger,
but
he
preferred
a
steel
knife
at
his
belt,
Jon
had
noticed.
Mormont
could
offer
no
answers
as
to
who
might
have
buried
the
cloak
or
what
it
might
mean.
Perhaps
Qhorin
will
know.
The
Halfhand
had
ventured
deeper
into
the
wild
than
any
other
living
man.

“You
want
to
serve,
or
shall
I?”

Jon
sheathed
the
dagger.
“I’ll
do
it.”
He
wanted
to
hear
what
they
were
saying.

Edd
cut
three
thick
slices
off
a
stale
round
of
oat
bread,
stacked
them
on
a
wooden
platter,
covered
them
with
bacon
and
bacon
drippings,
and
filled
a
bowl
with
hard-cooked
eggs.
Jon
took
the
bowl
in
one
hand
and
the
platter
in
the
other
and
backed
into
the
Lord
Commander’s
tent.

Qhorin
was
seated
cross-legged
on
the
floor,
his
spine
as
straight
as
a
spear.
Candlelight
flickered
against
the
hard
flat
planes
of
his
cheeks
as
he
spoke.
“…Rattleshirt,
the
Weeping
Man,
and
every
other
chief
great
and
small,”
he
was
saying.
“They
have
wargs
as
well,
and
mammoths,
and
more
strength
than
we
would
have
dreamed.
Or
so
he
claimed.
I
will
not
swear
as
to
the
truth
of
it.
Ebben
believes
the
man
was
telling
us
tales
to
make
his
life
last
a
little
longer.”

“True
or
false,
the
Wall
must
be
warned,”
the
Old
Bear
said
as
Jon
placed
the
platter
between
them.
“And
the
king.”

“Which
king?”

“All
of
them.
The
true
and
the
false
alike.
If
they
would
claim
the
realm,
let
them
defend
it.”

The
Halfhand
helped
himself
to
an
egg
and
cracked
it
on
the
edge
of
the
bowl.
“These
kings
will
do
what
they
will,”
he
said,
peeling
away
the
shell.
“Likely
it
will
be
little
enough.
The
best
hope
is
Winterfell.
The
Starks
must
rally
the
north.”

“Yes.
To
be
sure.”
The
Old
Bear
unrolled
a
map,
frowned
at
it,
tossed
it
aside,
opened
another.
He
was
pondering
where
the
hammer
would
fall,
Jon
could
see
it.
The
Watch
had
once
manned
seventeen
castles
along
the
hundred
leagues
of
the
Wall,
but
they
had
been
abandoned
one
by
one
as
the
brotherhood
dwindled.
Only
three
were
now
garrisoned,
a
fact
that
Mance
Rayder
knew
as
well
as
they
did.
“Ser
Alliser
Thorne
will
bring
back
fresh
levies
from
King’s
Landing,
we
can
hope.
If
we
man
Greyguard
from
the
Shadow
Tower
and
the
Long
Barrow
from
Eastwatch…”

“Greyguard
has
largely
collapsed.
Stonedoor
would
serve
better,
if
the
men
could
be
found.
Icemark
and
Deep
Lake
as
well,
mayhaps.
With
daily
patrols
along
the
battlements
between.”

“Patrols,
aye.
Twice
a
day,
if
we
can.
The
Wall
itself
is
a
formidable
obstacle.
Undefended,
it
cannot
stop
them,
yet
it
will
delay
them.
The
larger
the
host,
the
longer
they’ll
require.
From
the
emptiness
they’ve
left
behind,
they
must
mean
to
bring
their
women
with
them.
Their
young
as
well,
and
beasts…
have
you
ever
seen
a
goat
climb
a
ladder?
A
rope?
They
will
need
to
build
a
stair,
or
a
great
ramp…
it
will
take
a
moon’s
turn
at
the
least,
perhaps
longer.
Mance
will
know
his
best
chance
is
to
pass
beneath
the
Wall.
Through
a
gate,
or…”

“A
breach.”

Mormont’s
head
came
up
sharply.
“What?”

“They
do
not
plan
to
climb
the
Wall
nor
to
burrow
beneath
it,
my
lord.
They
plan
to
break
it.”

“The
Wall
is
seven
hundred
feet
high,
and
so
thick
at
the
base
that
it
would
take
a
hundred
men
a
year
to
cut
through
it
with
picks
and
axes.”

“Even
so.”

Mormont
plucked
at
his
beard,
frowning.
“How?”

“How
else?
Sorcery.”
Qhorin
bit
the
egg
in
half.
“Why
else
would
Mance
choose
to
gather
his
strength
in
the
Frostfangs?
Bleak
and
hard
they
are,
and
a
long
weary
march
from
the
Wall.”

“I’d
hoped
he
chose
the
mountains
to
hide
his
muster
from
the
eyes
of
my
rangers.”

“Perhaps,”
said
Qhorin,
finishing
the
egg,
“but
there
is
more,
I
think.
He
is
seeking
something
in
the
high
cold
places.
He
is
searching
for
something
he
needs.”

“Something?”
Mormont’s
raven
lifted
its
head
and
screamed.
The
sound
was
sharp
as
a
knife
in
the
closeness
of
the
tent.

“Some
power.
What
it
is,
our
captive
could
not
say.
He
was
questioned
perhaps
too
sharply,
and
died
with
much
unsaid.
I
doubt
he
knew
in
any
case.”

Jon
could
hear
the
wind
outside.
It
made
a
high
thin
sound
as
it
shivered
through
the
stones
of
the
ringwall
and
tugged
at
the
tent
ropes.
Mormont
rubbed
his
mouth
thoughtfully.
“Some
power,”
he
repeated.
“I
must
know.”

“Then
you
must
send
scouts
into
the
mountains.”

“I
am
loath
to
risk
more
men.”

“We
can
only
die.
Why
else
do
we
don
these
black
cloaks,
but
to
die
in
defense
of
the
realm?
I
would
send
fifteen
men,
in
three
parties
of
five.
One
to
probe
the
Milkwater,
one
the
Skirling
Pass,
one
to
climb
the
Giant’s
Stair.
Jarman
Buckwell,
Thoren
Smallwood,
and
myself
to
command.
To
learn
what
waits
in
those
mountains.”

“Waits,”
the
raven
cried.
“Waits.”

Lord
Commander
Mormont
sighed
deep
in
his
chest.
“I
see
no
other
choice,”
he
conceded,
“but
if
you
do
not
return…”

“Someone
will
come
down
out
of
the
Frostfangs,
my
lord,”
the
ranger
said.
“If
us,
all
well
and
good.
If
not,
it
will
be
Mance
Rayder,
and
you
sit
square
in
his
path.
He
cannot
march
south
and
leave
you
behind,
to
follow
and
harry
his
rear.
He
must
attack.
This
is
a
strong
place.”

“Not
that
strong,”
said
Mormont.

“Belike
we
shall
all
die,
then.
Our
dying
will
buy
time
for
our
brothers
on
the
Wall.
Time
to
garrison
the
empty
castles
and
freeze
shut
the
gates,
time
to
summon
lords
and
kings
to
their
aid,
time
to
hone
their
axes
and
repair
their
catapults.
Our
lives
will
be
coin
well
spent.”

“Die,”
the
raven
muttered,
pacing
along
Mormont’s
shoulders.
“Die,
die,
die,
die.”
The
old
Bear
sat
slumped
and
silent,
as
if
the
burden
of
speech
had
grown
too
heavy
for
him
to
bear.
But
at
last
he
said,
“May
the
gods
forgive
me.
Choose
your
men.”

Qhorin
Halfhand
turned
his
head.
His
eyes
met
Jon’s,
and
held
them
for
a
long
moment.
“Very
well.
I
choose
Jon
Snow.”

Mormont
blinked.
“He
is
hardly
more
than
a
boy.
And
my
steward
besides.
Not
even
a
ranger.”

“Tollett
can
care
for
you
as
well,
my
lord.”
Qhorin
lifted
his
maimed,
two-fingered
hand.
“The
old
gods
are
still
strong
beyond
the
Wall.
The
gods
of
the
First
Men…
and
the
Starks.”

Mormont
looked
at
Jon.
“What
is
your
will
in
this?”

“To
go,”
he
said
at
once.

The
old
man
smiled
sadly.
“I
thought
it
might
be.”

Dawn
had
broken
when
Jon
stepped
from
the
tent
beside
Qhorin
Halfhand.
The
wind
swirled
around
them,
stirring
their
black
cloaks
and
sending
a
scatter
of
red
cinders
flying
from
the
fire.

“We
ride
at
noon,”
the
ranger
told
him.
“Best
find
that
wolf
of
yours.”
=======
EDDARD

“Pain
is
a
gift
from
the
gods,
Lord
Eddard,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
told
him.
“It
means
the
bone
is
knitting,
the
flesh
healing
itself.
Be
thankful.”

“I
will
be
thankful
when
my
leg
stops
throbbing.”

Pycelle
set
a
stoppered
flask
on
the
table
by
the
bed.
“The
milk
of
the
poppy,
for
when
the
pain
grows
too
onerous.”

“I
sleep
too
much
already.”

“Sleep
is
the
great
healer.”

“I
had
hoped
that
was
you.”

Pycelle
smiled
wanly.
“It
is
good
to
see
you
in
such
a
fierce
humor,
my
lord.”
He
leaned
close
and
lowered
his
voice.
“There
was
a
raven
this
morning,
a
letter
for
the
queen
from
her
lord
father.
I
thought
you
had
best
know.”

“Dark
wings,
dark
words,”
Ned
said
grimly.
“What
of
it?”

“Lord
Tywin
is
greatly
wroth
about
the
men
you
sent
after
Ser
Gregor
Clegane,”
the
maester
confided.
“I
feared
he
would
be.
You
will
recall,
I
said
as
much
in
council.”

“Let
him
be
wroth,”
Ned
said.
Every
time
his
leg
throbbed,
he
remembered
Jaime
Lannister’s
smile,
and
Jory
dead
in
his
arms.
“Let
him
write
all
the
letters
to
the
queen
he
likes.
Lord
Beric
rides
beneath
the
king’s
own
banner.
If
Lord
Tywin
attempts
to
interfere
with
the
king’s
justice,
he
will
have
Robert
to
answer
to.
The
only
thing
His
Grace
enjoys
more
than
hunting
is
making
war
on
lords
who
defy
him.”

Pycelle
pulled
back,
his
maester’s
chain
jangling.
“As
you
say.
I
shall
visit
again
on
the
morrow.”
The
old
man
hurriedly
gathered
up
his
things
and
took
his
leave.
Ned
had
little
doubt
that
he
was
bound
straight
for
the
royal
apartments,
to
whisper
at
the
queen.
I
thought
you
had
best
know,
indeed…
as
if
Cersei
had
not
instructed
him
to
pass
along
her
father’s
threats.
He
hoped
his
response
rattled
those
perfect
teeth
of
hers.
Ned
was
not
near
as
confident
of
Robert
as
he
pretended,
but
there
was
no
reason
Cersei
need
know
that.

When
Pycelle
was
gone,
Ned
called
for
a
cup
of
honeyed
wine.
That
clouded
the
mind
as
well,
yet
not
as
badly.
He
needed
to
be
able
to
think.
A
thousand
times,
he
asked
himself
what
Jon
Arryn
might
have
done,
had
he
lived
long
enough
to
act
on
what
he’d
learned.
Or
perhaps
he
had
acted,
and
died
for
it.

It
was
queer
how
sometimes
a
child’s
innocent
eyes
can
see
things
that
grown
men
are
blind
to.
Someday,
when
Sansa
was
grown,
he
would
have
to
tell
her
how
she
had
made
it
all
come
clear
for
him.
He’s
not
the
least
bit
like
that
old
drunken
king,
she
had
declared,
angry
and
unknowing,
and
the
simple
truth
of
it
had
twisted
inside
him,
cold
as
death.
This
was
the
sword
that
killed
Jon
Arryn,
Ned
thought
then,
and
it
will
kill
Robert
as
well,
a
slower
death
but
full
as
certain.
Shattered
legs
may
heal
in
time,
but
some
betrayals
fester
and
poison
the
soul.

Littlefinger
came
calling
an
hour
after
the
Grand
Maester
had
left,
clad
in
a
plum-colored
doublet
with
a
mockingbird
embroidered
on
the
breast
in
black
thread,
and
a
striped
cloak
of
black
and
white.
“I
cannot
visit
long,
my
lord,”
he
announced.
“Lady
Tanda
expects
me
to
lunch
with
her.
No
doubt
she
will
roast
me
a
fatted
calf.
If
it’s
near
as
fatted
as
her
daughter,
I’m
like
to
rupture
and
die.
And
how
is
your
leg?”

“Inflamed
and
painful,
with
an
itch
that
is
driving
me
mad.”

Littlefinger
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“In
future,
try
not
to
let
any
horses
fall
on
it.
I
would
urge
you
to
heal
quickly.
The
realm
grows
restive.
Varys
has
heard
ominous
whispers
from
the
west.
Freeriders
and
sellswords
have
been
flocking
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
not
for
the
thin
pleasure
of
Lord
Tywin’s
conversation.”

“Is
there
word
of
the
king?”
Ned
demanded.
“Just
how
long
does
Robert
intend
to
hunt?”

“Given
his
preferences,
I
believe
he’d
stay
in
the
forest
until
you
and
the
queen
both
die
of
old
age,”
Lord
Petyr
replied
with
a
faint
smile.
“Lacking
that,
I
imagine
he’ll
return
as
soon
as
he’s
killed
something.
They
found
the
white
hart,
it
seems…
or
rather,
what
remained
of
it.
Some
wolves
found
it
first,
and
left
His
Grace
scarcely
more
than
a
hoof
and
a
horn.
Robert
was
in
a
fury,
until
he
heard
talk
of
some
monstrous
boar
deeper
in
the
forest.
Then
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
have
it.
Prince
Joffrey
returned
this
morning,
with
the
Royces,
Ser
Balon
Swann,
and
some
twenty
others
of
the
party.
The
rest
are
still
with
the
king.”

“The
Hound?”
Ned
asked,
frowning.
Of
all
the
Lannister
party,
Sandor
Clegane
was
the
one
who
concerned
him
the
most,
now
that
Ser
Jaime
had
fled
the
city
to
join
his
father.

“Oh,
returned
with
Joffrey,
and
went
straight
to
the
queen.”
Littlefinger
smiled.
“I
would
have
given
a
hundred
silver
stags
to
have
been
a
roach
in
the
rushes
when
he
learned
that
Lord
Beric
was
off
to
behead
his
brother.”

“Even
a
blind
man
could
see
the
Hound
loathed
his
brother.”

“Ah,
but
Gregor
was
his
to
loathe,
not
yours
to
kill.
Once
Dondarrion
lops
the
summit
off
our
Mountain,
the
Clegane
lands
and
incomes
will
pass
to
Sandor,
but
I
wouldn’t
hold
my
water
waiting
for
his
thanks,
not
that
one.
And
now
you
must
forgive
me.
Lady
Tanda
awaits
with
her
fatted
calves.”

On
the
way
to
the
door,
Lord
Petyr
spied
Grand
Maester
Malleon’s
massive
tome
on
the
table
and
paused
to
idly
flip
open
the
cover.
“The
Lineages
and
Histories
of
the
Great
Houses
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
With
Descriptions
of
Many
High
Lords
and
Noble
Ladies
and
Their
Children,”
he
read.
“Now
there
is
tedious
reading
if
ever
I
saw
it.
A
sleeping
potion,
my
lord?”

For
a
brief
moment
Ned
considered
telling
him
all
of
it,
but
there
was
something
in
Littlefinger’s
japes
that
irked
him.
The
man
was
too
clever
by
half,
a
mocking
smile
never
far
from
his
lips.
“Jon
Arryn
was
studying
this
volume
when
he
was
taken
sick,”
Ned
said
in
a
careful
tone,
to
see
how
he
might
respond.

And
he
responded
as
he
always
did:
with
a
quip.
“In
that
case,”
he
said,
“death
must
have
come
as
a
blessed
relief.”
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
bowed
and
took
his
leave.

Eddard
Stark
allowed
himself
a
curse.
Aside
from
his
own
retainers,
there
was
scarcely
a
man
in
this
city
he
trusted.
Littlefinger
had
concealed
Catelyn
and
helped
Ned
in
his
inquiries,
yet
his
haste
to
save
his
own
skin
when
Jaime
and
his
swords
had
come
out
of
the
rain
still
rankled.
Varys
was
worse.
For
all
his
protestations
of
loyalty,
the
eunuch
knew
too
much
and
did
too
little.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
seemed
more
Cersei’s
creature
with
every
passing
day,
and
Ser
Barristan
was
an
old
man,
and
rigid.
He
would
tell
Ned
to
do
his
duty.

Time
was
perilously
short.
The
king
would
return
from
his
hunt
soon,
and
honor
would
require
Ned
to
go
to
him
with
all
he
had
learned.
Vayon
Poole
had
arranged
for
Sansa
and
Arya
to
sail
on
the
Wind
Witch
out
of
Braavos,
three
days
hence.
They
would
be
back
at
Winterfell
before
the
harvest.
Ned
could
no
longer
use
his
concern
for
their
safety
to
excuse
his
delay.

Yet
last
night
he
had
dreamt
of
Rhaegar’s
children.
Lord
Tywin
had
laid
the
bodies
beneath
the
Iron
Throne,
wrapped
in
the
crimson
cloaks
of
his
house
guard.
That
was
clever
of
him;
the
blood
did
not
show
so
badly
against
the
red
cloth.
The
little
princess
had
been
barefoot,
still
dressed
in
her
bed
gown,
and
the
boy…
the
boy…

Ned
could
not
let
that
happen
again.
The
realm
could
not
withstand
a
second
mad
king,
another
dance
of
blood
and
vengeance.
He
must
find
some
way
to
save
the
children.

Robert
could
be
merciful.
Ser
Barristan
was
scarcely
the
only
man
he
had
pardoned.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
Varys
the
Spider,
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy;
each
had
been
counted
an
enemy
to
Robert
once,
and
each
had
been
welcomed
into
friendship
and
allowed
to
retain
honors
and
office
for
a
pledge
of
fealty.
So
long
as
a
man
was
brave
and
honest,
Robert
would
treat
him
with
all
the
honor
and
respect
due
a
valiant
enemy.

This
was
something
else:
poison
in
the
dark,
a
knife
thrust
to
the
soul.
This
he
could
never
forgive,
no
more
than
he
had
forgiven
Rhaegar.
He
will
kill
them
all,
Ned
realized.

And
yet,
he
knew
he
could
not
keep
silent.
He
had
a
duty
to
Robert,
to
the
realm,
to
the
shade
of
Jon
Arryn…
and
to
Bran,
who
surely
must
have
stumbled
on
some
part
of
the
truth.
Why
else
would
they
have
tried
to
slay
him?

Late
that
afternoon
he
summoned
Tomard,
the
portly
guardsman
with
the
ginger-colored
whiskers
his
children
called
Fat
Tom.
With
Jory
dead
and
Alyn
gone,
Fat
Tom
had
command
of
his
household
guard.
The
thought
filled
Ned
with
vague
disquiet.
Tomard
was
a
solid
man;
affable,
loyal,
tireless,
capable
in
a
limited
way,
but
he
was
near
fifty,
and
even
in
his
youth
he
had
never
been
energetic.
Perhaps
Ned
should
not
have
been
so
quick
to
send
off
half
his
guard,
and
all
his
best
swords
among
them.

“I
shall
require
your
help,”
Ned
said
when
Tomard
appeared,
looking
faintly
apprehensive,
as
he
always
did
when
called
before
his
lord.
“Take
me
to
the
godswood.”

“Is
that
wise,
Lord
Eddard?
With
your
leg
and
all?”

“Perhaps
not.
But
necessary.”

Tomard
summoned
Varly.
With
one
arm
around
each
man’s
shoulders,
Ned
managed
to
descend
the
steep
tower
steps
and
hobble
across
the
bailey.
“I
want
the
guard
doubled,”
he
told
Fat
Tom.
“No
one
enters
or
leaves
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
without
my
leave.”

Tom
blinked.
“M’lord,
with
Alyn
and
the
others
away,
we
are
hard-pressed
already—”

“It
will
only
be
a
short
while.
Lengthen
the
watches.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord,”
Tom
answered.
“Might
I
ask
why—”

“Best
not,”
Ned
answered
crisply.

The
godswood
was
empty,
as
it
always
was
here
in
this
citadel
of
the
southron
gods.
Ned’s
leg
was
screaming
as
they
lowered
him
to
the
grass
beside
the
heart
tree.
“Thank
you.”
He
drew
a
paper
from
his
sleeve,
sealed
with
the
sigil
of
his
House.
“Kindly
deliver
this
at
once.”

Tomard
looked
at
the
name
Ned
had
written
on
the
paper
and
licked
his
lips
anxiously.
“My
lord…”

“Do
as
I
bid
you,
Tom,”
Ned
said.

How
long
he
waited
in
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
he
could
not
say.
It
was
peaceful
here.
The
thick
walls
shut
out
the
clamor
of
the
castle,
and
he
could
hear
birds
singing,
the
murmur
of
crickets,
leaves
rustling
in
a
gentle
wind.
The
heart
tree
was
an
oak,
brown
and
faceless,
yet
Ned
Stark
still
felt
the
presence
of
his
gods.
His
leg
did
not
seem
to
hurt
so
much.

She
came
to
him
at
sunset,
as
the
clouds
reddened
above
the
walls
and
towers.
She
came
alone,
as
he
had
bid
her.
For
once
she
was
dressed
simply,
in
leather
boots
and
hunting
greens.
When
she
drew
back
the
hood
of
her
brown
cloak,
he
saw
the
bruise
where
the
king
had
struck
her.
The
angry
plum
color
had
faded
to
yellow,
and
the
swelling
was
down,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
but
what
it
was.

“Why
here?”
Cersei
Lannister
asked
as
she
stood
over
him.

“So
the
gods
can
see.”

She
sat
beside
him
on
the
grass.
Her
every
move
was
graceful.
Her
curling
blond
hair
moved
in
the
wind,
and
her
eyes
were
green
as
the
leaves
of
summer.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
Ned
Stark
had
seen
her
beauty,
but
he
saw
it
now.
“I
know
the
truth
Jon
Arryn
died
for,”
he
told
her.

“Do
you?”
The
queen
watched
his
face,
wary
as
a
cat.
“Is
that
why
you
called
me
here,
Lord
Stark?
To
pose
me
riddles?
Or
is
it
your
intent
to
seize
me,
as
your
wife
seized
my
brother?”

“If
you
truly
believed
that,
you
would
never
have
come.”
Ned
touched
her
cheek
gently.
“Has
he
done
this
before?”

“Once
or
twice.”
She
shied
away
from
his
hand.
“Never
on
the
face
before.
Jaime
would
have
killed
him,
even
if
it
meant
his
own
life.”
Cersei
looked
at
him
defiantly.
“My
brother
is
worth
a
hundred
of
your
friend.”

“Your
brother?”
Ned
said.
“Or
your
lover?”

“Both.”
She
did
not
flinch
from
the
truth.
“Since
we
were
children
together.
And
why
not?
The
Targaryens
wed
brother
to
sister
for
three
hundred
years,
to
keep
the
bloodlines
pure.
And
Jaime
and
I
are
more
than
brother
and
sister.
We
are
one
person
in
two
bodies.
We
shared
a
womb
together.
He
came
into
this
world
holding
my
foot,
our
old
maester
said.
When
he
is
in
me,
I
feel…
whole.”
The
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
over
her
lips.

“My
son
Bran…”

To
her
credit,
Cersei
did
not
look
away.
“He
saw
us.
You
love
your
children,
do
you
not?”

Robert
had
asked
him
the
very
same
question,
the
morning
of
the
melee.
He
gave
her
the
same
answer.
“With
all
my
heart.”

“No
less
do
I
love
mine.”

Ned
thought,
If
it
came
to
that,
the
life
of
some
child
I
did
not
know,
against
Robb
and
Sansa
and
Arya
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
what
would
I
do?
Even
more
so,
what
would
Catelyn
do,
if
it
were
Jon’s
life,
against
the
children
of
her
body?
He
did
not
know.
He
prayed
he
never
would.

“All
three
are
Jaime’s,”
he
said.
It
was
not
a
question.

“Thank
the
gods.”

The
seed
is
strong,
Jon
Arryn
had
cried
on
his
deathbed,
and
so
it
was.
All
those
bastards,
all
with
hair
as
black
as
night.
Grand
Maester
Malleon
recorded
the
last
mating
between
stag
and
lion,
some
ninety
years
ago,
when
Tya
Lannister
wed
Gowen
Baratheon,
third
son
of
the
reigning
lord.
Their
only
issue,
an
unnamed
boy
described
in
Malleon’s
tome
as
a
large
and
lusty
lad
born
with
a
full
head
of
black
hair,
died
in
infancy.
Thirty
years
before
that
a
male
Lannister
had
taken
a
Baratheon
maid
to
wife.
She
had
given
him
three
daughters
and
a
son,
each
black-haired.
No
matter
how
far
back
Ned
searched
in
the
brittle
yellowed
pages,
always
he
found
the
gold
yielding
before
the
coal.

“A
dozen
years,”
Ned
said.
“How
is
it
that
you
have
had
no
children
by
the
king?”

She
lifted
her
head,
defiant.
“Your
Robert
got
me
with
child
once,”
she
said,
her
voice
thick
with
contempt.
“My
brother
found
a
woman
to
cleanse
me.
He
never
knew.
If
truth
be
told,
I
can
scarcely
bear
for
him
to
touch
me,
and
I
have
not
let
him
inside
me
for
years.
I
know
other
ways
to
pleasure
him,
when
he
leaves
his
whores
long
enough
to
stagger
up
to
my
bedchamber.
Whatever
we
do,
the
king
is
usually
so
drunk
that
he’s
forgotten
it
all
by
the
next
morning.”

How
could
they
have
all
been
so
blind?
The
truth
was
there
in
front
of
them
all
the
time,
written
on
the
children’s
faces.
Ned
felt
sick.
“I
remember
Robert
as
he
was
the
day
he
took
the
throne,
every
inch
a
king,”
he
said
quietly.
“A
thousand
other
women
might
have
loved
him
with
all
their
hearts.
What
did
he
do
to
make
you
hate
him
so?”

Her
eyes
burned,
green
fire
in
the
dusk,
like
the
lioness
that
was
her
sigil.
“The
night
of
our
wedding
feast,
the
first
time
we
shared
a
bed,
he
called
me
by
your
sister’s
name.
He
was
on
top
of
me,
in
me,
stinking
of
wine,
and
he
whispered
Lyanna.”

Ned
Stark
thought
of
pale
blue
roses,
and
for
a
moment
he
wanted
to
weep.
“I
do
not
know
which
of
you
I
pity
most.”

The
queen
seemed
amused
by
that.
“Save
your
pity
for
yourself,
Lord
Stark.
I
want
none
of
it.”

“You
know
what
I
must
do.”

“Must?”
She
put
her
hand
on
his
good
leg,
just
above
the
knee.
“A
true
man
does
what
he
will,
not
what
he
must.”
Her
fingers
brushed
lightly
against
his
thigh,
the
gentlest
of
promises.
“The
realm
needs
a
strong
Hand.
Joff
will
not
come
of
age
for
years.
No
one
wants
war
again,
least
of
all
me.”
Her
hand
touched
his
face,
his
hair.
“If
friends
can
turn
to
enemies,
enemies
can
become
friends.
Your
wife
is
a
thousand
leagues
away,
and
my
brother
has
fled.
Be
kind
to
me,
Ned.
I
swear
to
you,
you
shall
never
regret
it.”

“Did
you
make
the
same
offer
to
Jon
Arryn?”

She
slapped
him.

“I
shall
wear
that
as
a
badge
of
honor,”
Ned
said
dryly.

“Honor,”
she
spat.
“How
dare
you
play
the
noble
lord
with
me!
What
do
you
take
me
for?
You’ve
a
bastard
of
your
own,
I’ve
seen
him.
Who
was
the
mother,
I
wonder?
Some
Dornish
peasant
you
raped
while
her
holdfast
burned?
A
whore?
Or
was
it
the
grieving
sister,
the
Lady
Ashara?
She
threw
herself
into
the
sea,
I’m
told.
Why
was
that?
For
the
brother
you
slew,
or
the
child
you
stole?
Tell
me,
my
honorable
Lord
Eddard,
how
are
you
any
different
from
Robert,
or
me,
or
Jaime?”

“For
a
start,”
said
Ned,
“I
do
not
kill
children.
You
would
do
well
to
listen,
my
lady.
I
shall
say
this
only
once.
When
the
king
returns
from
his
hunt,
I
intend
to
lay
the
truth
before
him.
You
must
be
gone
by
then.
You
and
your
children,
all
three,
and
not
to
Casterly
Rock.
If
I
were
you,
I
should
take
ship
for
the
Free
Cities,
or
even
farther,
to
the
Summer
Isles
or
the
Port
of
Ibben.
As
far
as
the
winds
blow.”

“Exile,”
she
said.
“A
bitter
cup
to
drink
from.”

“A
sweeter
cup
than
your
father
served
Rhaegar’s
children,”
Ned
said,
“and
kinder
than
you
deserve.
Your
father
and
your
brothers
would
do
well
to
go
with
you.
Lord
Tywin’s
gold
will
buy
you
comfort
and
hire
swords
to
keep
you
safe.
You
shall
need
them.
I
promise
you,
no
matter
where
you
flee,
Robert’s
wrath
will
follow
you,
to
the
back
of
beyond
if
need
be.”

The
queen
stood.
“And
what
of
my
wrath,
Lord
Stark?”
she
asked
softly.
Her
eyes
searched
his
face.
“You
should
have
taken
the
realm
for
yourself.
It
was
there
for
the
taking.
Jaime
told
me
how
you
found
him
on
the
Iron
Throne
the
day
King’s
Landing
fell,
and
made
him
yield
it
up.
That
was
your
moment.
All
you
needed
to
do
was
climb
those
steps,
and
sit.
Such
a
sad
mistake.”

“I
have
made
more
mistakes
than
you
can
possibly
imagine,”
Ned
said,
“but
that
was
not
one
of
them.”

“Oh,
but
it
was,
my
lord,”
Cersei
insisted.
“When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die.
There
is
no
middle
ground.”

She
turned
up
her
hood
to
hide
her
swollen
face
and
left
him
there
in
the
dark
beneath
the
oak,
amidst
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
under
a
blue-black
sky.
The
stars
were
coming
out.

TYRION

“The
queen
intends
to
send
Prince
Tommen
away.”
They
knelt
alone
in
the
hushed
dimness
of
the
sept,
surrounded
by
shadows
and
flickering
candles,
but
even
so
Lancel
kept
his
voice
low.
“Lord
Gyles
will
take
him
to
Rosby,
and
conceal
him
there
in
the
guise
of
a
page.
They
plan
to
darken
his
hair
and
tell
everyone
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
hedge
knight.”

“Is
it
the
mob
she
fears?
Or
me?”

“Both,”
said
Lancel.

“Ah.”
Tyrion
had
known
nothing
of
this
ploy.
Had
Varys’s
little
birds
failed
him
for
once?
Even
spiders
must
nod,
he
supposed…
or
was
the
eunuch
playing
a
deeper
and
more
subtle
game
than
he
knew?
“You
have
my
thanks,
ser.”

“Will
you
grant
me
the
boon
I
asked
of
you?”

“Perhaps.”
Lancel
wanted
his
own
command
in
the
next
battle.
A
splendid
way
to
die
before
he
finished
growing
that
mustache,
but
young
knights
always
think
themselves
invincible.

Tyrion
lingered
after
his
cousin
had
slipped
away.
At
the
Warrior’s
altar,
he
used
one
candle
to
light
another.
Watch
over
my
brother,
you
bloody
bastard,
he’s
one
of
yours.
He
lit
a
second
candle
to
the
Stranger,
for
himself.

That
night,
when
the
Red
Keep
was
dark,
Bronn
arrived
to
find
him
sealing
a
letter.
“Take
this
to
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater.”
The
dwarf
dribbled
hot
golden
wax
down
onto
the
parchment.

“What
does
it
say?”
Bronn
could
not
read,
so
he
asked
impudent
questions.

“That
he’s
to
take
fifty
of
his
best
swords
and
scout
the
roseroad.”
Tyrion
pressed
his
seal
into
the
soft
wax.

“Stannis
is
more
like
to
come
up
the
kingsroad.”

“Oh,
I
know.
Tell
Bywater
to
disregard
what’s
in
the
letter
and
take
his
men
north.
He’s
to
lay
a
trap
along
the
Rosby
road.
Lord
Gyles
will
depart
for
his
castle
in
a
day
or
two,
with
a
dozen
men-at-arms,
some
servants,
and
my
nephew.
Prince
Tommen
may
be
dressed
as
a
page.”

“You
want
the
boy
brought
back,
is
that
it?”

“No.
I
want
him
taken
on
to
the
castle.”
Removing
the
boy
from
the
city
was
one
of
his
sister’s
better
notions,
Tyrion
had
decided.
At
Rosby,
Tommen
would
be
safe
from
the
mob,
and
keeping
him
apart
from
his
brother
also
made
things
more
difficult
for
Stannis;
even
if
he
took
King’s
Landing
and
executed
Joffrey,
he’d
still
have
a
Lannister
claimant
to
contend
with.
“Lord
Gyles
is
too
sickly
to
run
and
too
craven
to
fight.
He’ll
command
his
castellan
to
open
the
gates.
Once
inside
the
walls,
Bywater
is
to
expel
the
garrison
and
hold
Tommen
there
safe.
Ask
him
how
he
likes
the
sound
of
Lord
Bywater.”

“Lord
Bronn
would
sound
better.
I
could
grab
the
boy
for
you
just
as
well.
I’ll
dandle
him
on
my
knee
and
sing
him
nursery
songs
if
there’s
a
lordship
in
it.”

“I
need
you
here,”
said
Tyrion.
And
I
don’t
trust
you
with
my
nephew.
Should
any
ill
befall
Joffrey,
the
Lannister
claim
to
the
Iron
Throne
would
rest
on
Tommen’s
young
shoulders.
Ser
Jacelyn’s
gold
cloaks
would
defend
the
boy;
Bronn’s
sellswords
were
more
apt
to
sell
him
to
his
enemies.

“What
should
the
new
lord
do
with
the
old
one?”

“Whatever
he
pleases,
so
long
as
he
remembers
to
feed
him.
I
don’t
want
him
dying.”
Tyrion
pushed
away
from
the
table.
“My
sister
will
send
one
of
the
Kingsguard
with
the
prince.”

Bronn
was
not
concerned.
“The
Hound
is
Joffrey’s
dog,
he
won’t
leave
him.
Ironhand’s
gold
cloaks
should
be
able
to
handle
the
others
easy
enough.”

“If
it
comes
to
killing,
tell
Ser
Jacelyn
I
won’t
have
it
done
in
front
of
Tommen.”
Tyrion
donned
a
heavy
cloak
of
dark
brown
wool.
“My
nephew
is
tender-hearted.”

“Are
you
certain
he’s
a
Lannister?”

“I’m
certain
of
nothing
but
winter
and
battle,”
he
said.
“Come.
I’m
riding
with
you
part
of
the
way.”

“Chataya’s?”

“You
know
me
too
well.”

They
left
through
a
postern
gate
in
the
north
wall.
Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
clattered
down
Shadowblack
Lane.
A
few
furtive
shapes
darted
into
alleys
at
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
on
the
cobbles,
but
no
one
dared
accost
them.
The
council
had
extended
his
curfew;
it
was
death
to
be
taken
on
the
streets
after
the
evenfall
bells
had
sung.
The
measure
had
restored
a
degree
of
peace
to
King’s
Landing
and
quartered
the
number
of
corpses
found
in
the
alleys
of
a
morning,
yet
Varys
said
the
people
cursed
him
for
it.
They
should
be
thankful
they
have
the
breath
to
curse.
A
pair
of
gold
cloaks
confronted
them
as
they
were
making
their
way
along
Coppersmith’s
Wynd,
but
when
they
realized
whom
they’d
challenged
they
begged
the
Hand’s
pardons
and
waved
them
on.
Bronn
turned
south
for
the
Mud
Gate
and
they
parted
company.

Tyrion
rode
on
toward
Chataya’s,
but
suddenly
his
patience
deserted
him.
He
twisted
in
the
saddle,
scanning
the
street
behind.
There
were
no
signs
of
followers.
Every
window
was
dark
or
tightly
shuttered.
He
heard
nothing
but
the
wind
swirling
down
the
alleys.
If
Cersei
has
someone
stalking
me
tonight,
he
must
be
disguised
as
a
rat.
“Bugger
it
all,”
he
muttered.
He
was
sick
of
caution.
Wheeling
his
horse
around,
he
dug
in
his
spurs.
If
anyone’s
after
me,
we’ll
see
how
well
they
ride.
He
flew
through
the
moonlight
streets,
clattering
over
cobbles,
darting
down
narrow
alleys
and
up
twisty
wynds,
racing
to
his
love.

As
he
hammered
on
the
gate
he
heard
music
wafting
faintly
over
the
spiked
stone
walls.
One
of
the
Ibbenese
ushered
him
inside.
Tyrion
gave
the
man
his
horse
and
said,
“Who
is
that?”
The
diamond-shaped
panes
of
the
longhall
windows
shone
with
yellow
light,
and
he
could
hear
a
man
singing.

The
Ibbenese
shrugged.
“Fatbelly
singer.”

The
sound
swelled
as
he
walked
from
the
stable
to
the
house.
Tyrion
had
never
been
fond
of
singers,
and
he
liked
this
one
even
less
than
the
run
of
the
breed,
sight
unseen.
When
he
pushed
open
the
door,
the
man
broke
off.
“My
lord
Hand.”
He
knelt,
balding
and
kettle-bellied,
murmuring,
“An
honor,
an
honor.”

“M’lord.”
Shae
smiled
at
the
sight
of
him.
He
liked
that
smile,
the
quick
unthinking
way
it
came
to
her
pretty
face.
The
girl
wore
her
purple
silk,
belted
with
a
cloth-of-silver
sash.
The
colors
favored
her
dark
hair
and
the
smooth
cream
of
her
skin.

“Sweetling,”
he
called
her.
“And
who
is
this?”

The
singer
raised
his
eyes.
“I
am
called
Symon
Silver
Tongue,
my
lord.
A
player,
a
singer,
a
taleteller—”

“And
a
great
fool,”
Tyrion
finished.
“What
did
you
call
me,
when
I
entered?”

“Call?
I
only…”
The
silver
in
Symon’s
tongue
seemed
to
have
turned
to
lead.
“My
lord
Hand,
I
said,
an
honor…”

“A
wiser
man
would
have
pretended
not
to
recognize
me.
Not
that
I
would
have
been
fooled,
but
you
ought
to
have
tried.
What
am
I
to
do
with
you
now?
You
know
of
my
sweet
Shae,
you
know
where
she
dwells,
you
know
that
I
visit
by
night
alone.”

“I
swear,
I’ll
tell
no
one…”

“On
that
much
we
agree.
Good
night
to
you.”
Tyrion
led
Shae
up
the
stairs.

“My
singer
may
never
sing
again
now,”
she
teased.
“You’ve
scared
the
voice
from
him.”

“A
little
fear
will
help
him
reach
those
high
notes.”

She
closed
the
door
to
their
bedchamber.
“You
won’t
hurt
him,
will
you?”
She
lit
a
scented
candle
and
knelt
to
pull
off
his
boots.
“His
songs
cheer
me
on
the
nights
you
don’t
come.”

“Would
that
I
could
come
every
night,”
he
said
as
she
rubbed
his
bare
feet.
“How
well
does
he
sing?”

“Better
than
some.
Not
so
good
as
others.”

Tyrion
opened
her
robe
and
buried
his
face
between
her
breasts.
She
always
smelled
clean
to
him,
even
in
this
reeking
sty
of
a
city.
“Keep
him
if
you
like,
but
keep
him
close.
I
won’t
have
him
wandering
the
city
spreading
tales
in
pot-shops.”

“He
won’t—”
she
started.

Tyrion
covered
her
mouth
with
his
own.
He’d
had
talk
enough;
he
needed
the
sweet
simplicity
of
the
pleasure
he
found
between
Shae’s
thighs.
Here,
at
least,
he
was
welcome,
wanted.

Afterward,
he
eased
his
arm
out
from
under
her
head,
slipped
on
his
tunic,
and
went
down
to
the
garden.
A
half-moon
silvered
the
leaves
of
the
fruit
trees
and
shone
on
the
surface
of
the
stone
bathing
pond.
Tyrion
seated
himself
beside
the
water.
Somewhere
off
to
his
right
a
cricket
was
chirping,
a
curiously
homey
sound.
It
is
peaceful
here,
he
thought,
but
for
how
long?

A
whiff
of
something
rank
made
him
turn
his
head.
Shae
stood
in
the
door
behind
him,
dressed
in
the
silvery
robe
he’d
given
her.
I
loved
a
maid
as
white
as
winter,
with
moonglow
in
her
hair.
Behind
her
stood
one
of
the
begging
brothers,
a
portly
man
in
filthy
patched
robes,
his
bare
feet
crusty
with
dirt,
a
bowl
hung
about
his
neck
on
a
leather
thong
where
a
septon
would
have
worn
a
crystal.
The
smell
of
him
would
have
gagged
a
rat.

“Lord
Varys
has
come
to
see
you,”
Shae
announced.

The
begging
brother
blinked
at
her,
astonished.
Tyrion
laughed.
“To
be
sure.
How
is
it
you
knew
him
when
I
did
not?”

She
shrugged.
“It’s
still
him.
Only
dressed
different.”

“A
different
look,
a
different
smell,
a
different
way
of
walking,”
said
Tyrion.
“Most
men
would
be
deceived.”

“And
most
women,
maybe.
But
not
whores.
A
whore
learns
to
see
the
man,
not
his
garb,
or
she
turns
up
dead
in
an
alley.”

Varys
looked
pained,
and
not
because
of
the
false
scabs
on
his
feet.
Tyrion
chuckled.
“Shae,
would
you
bring
us
some
wine?”
He
might
need
a
drink.
Whatever
brought
the
eunuch
here
in
the
dead
of
night
was
not
like
to
be
good.

“I
almost
fear
to
tell
you
why
I’ve
come,
my
lord,”
Varys
said
when
Shae
had
left
them.
“I
bring
dire
tidings.”

“You
ought
to
dress
in
black
feathers,
Varys,
you’re
as
bad
an
omen
as
any
raven.”
Awkwardly,
Tyrion
pushed
to
his
feet,
half
afraid
to
ask
the
next
question.
“Is
it
Jaime?”
If
they
have
harmed
him,
nothing
will
save
them.

“No,
my
lord.
A
different
matter.
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
dead.
Storm’s
End
has
opened
its
gates
to
Stannis
Baratheon.”

Dismay
drove
all
other
thoughts
from
Tyrion’s
mind.
When
Shae
returned
with
the
wine,
he
took
one
sip
and
flung
the
cup
away
to
explode
against
the
side
of
the
house.
She
raised
a
hand
to
shield
herself
from
the
shards
as
the
wine
ran
down
the
stones
in
long
fingers,
black
in
the
moonlight.
“Damn
him!”
Tyrion
said.

Varys
smiled,
showing
a
mouth
full
of
rotted
teeth.
“Who,
my
lord?
Ser
Cortnay
or
Lord
Stannis?”

“Both
of
them.”
Storm’s
End
was
strong,
it
should
have
been
able
to
hold
out
for
half
a
year
or
more…
time
enough
for
his
father
to
finish
with
Robb
Stark.
“How
did
this
happen?”

Varys
glanced
at
Shae.
“My
lord,
must
we
trouble
your
sweet
lady’s
sleep
with
such
grim
and
bloody
talk?”

“A
lady
might
be
afraid,”
said
Shae,
“but
I’m
not.”

“You
should
be,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“With
Storm’s
End
fallen,
Stannis
will
soon
turn
his
attention
toward
King’s
Landing.”
He
regretted
flinging
away
that
wine
now.
“Lord
Varys,
give
us
a
moment,
and
I’ll
ride
back
to
the
castle
with
you.”

“I
shall
wait
in
the
stables.”
He
bowed
and
stomped
off.

Tyrion
drew
Shae
down
beside
him.
“You
are
not
safe
here.”

“I
have
my
walls,
and
the
guards
you
gave
me.”

“Sellswords,”
Tyrion
said.
“They
like
my
gold
well
enough,
but
will
they
die
for
it?
As
for
these
walls,
a
man
could
stand
on
another’s
shoulders
and
be
over
in
a
heartbeat.
A
manse
much
like
this
one
was
burned
during
the
riots.
They
killed
the
goldsmith
who
owned
it
for
the
crime
of
having
a
full
larder,
just
as
they
tore
the
High
Septon
to
pieces,
raped
Lollys
half
a
hundred
times,
and
smashed
Ser
Aron’s
skull
in.
What
do
you
think
they
would
do
if
they
got
their
hands
on
the
Hand’s
lady?”

“The
Hand’s
whore,
you
mean?”
She
looked
at
him
with
those
big
bold
eyes
of
hers.
“Though
I
would
be
your
lady,
m’lord.
I’d
dress
in
all
the
beautiful
things
you
gave
me,
in
satin
and
samite
and
cloth-of-gold,
and
I’d
wear
your
jewels
and
hold
your
hand
and
sit
by
you
at
feasts.
I
could
give
you
sons,
I
know
I
could…
and
I
vow
I’d
never
shame
you.”

My
love
for
you
shames
me
enough.
“A
sweet
dream,
Shae.
Now
put
it
aside,
I
beg
you.
It
can
never
be.”

“Because
of
the
queen?
I’m
not
afraid
of
her
either.”

“I
am.”

“Then
kill
her
and
be
done
with
it.
It’s
not
as
if
there
was
any
love
between
you.”

Tyrion
sighed.
“She’s
my
sister.
The
man
who
kills
his
own
blood
is
cursed
forever
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.
Moreover,
whatever
you
and
I
may
think
of
Cersei,
my
father
and
brother
hold
her
dear.
I
can
scheme
with
any
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
the
gods
have
not
equipped
me
to
face
Jaime
with
swords
in
hand.”

“The
Young
Wolf
and
Lord
Stannis
have
swords
and
they
don’t
scare
you.”

How
little
you
know,
sweetling.
“Against
them
I
have
all
the
power
of
House
Lannister.
Against
Jaime
or
my
father,
I
have
no
more
than
a
twisted
back
and
a
pair
of
stunted
legs.”

“You
have
me.”
Shae
kissed
him,
her
arms
sliding
around
his
neck
as
she
pressed
her
body
to
his.

The
kiss
aroused
him,
as
her
kisses
always
did,
but
this
time
Tyrion
gently
disentangled
himself.
“Not
now.
Sweetling,
I
have…
well,
call
it
the
seed
of
a
plan.
I
think
I
might
be
able
to
bring
you
into
the
castle
kitchens.”

Shae’s
face
went
still.
“The
kitchens?”

“Yes.
If
I
act
through
Varys,
no
one
will
be
the
wiser.”

She
giggled.
“M’lord,
I’d
poison
you.
Every
man
who’s
tasted
my
cooking
has
told
me
what
a
good
whore
I
am.”

“The
Red
Keep
has
sufficient
cooks.
Butchers
and
bakers
too.
You’d
need
to
pose
as
a
scullion.”

“A
pot
girl,”
she
said,
“in
scratchy
brown
roughspun.
Is
that
how
m’lord
wants
to
see
me?”

“M’lord
wants
to
see
you
alive,”
Tyrion
said.
“You
can
scarcely
scour
pots
in
silk
and
velvet.”

“Has
m’lord
grown
tired
of
me?”
She
reached
a
hand
under
his
tunic
and
found
his
cock.
In
two
quick
strokes
she
had
it
hard.
“He
still
wants
me.”
She
laughed.
“Would
you
like
to
fuck
your
kitchen
wench,
m’lord?
You
can
dust
me
with
flour
and
suck
gravy
off
my
titties
if
you…”

“Stop
it.”
The
way
she
was
acting
reminded
him
of
Dancy,
who
had
tried
so
hard
to
win
her
wager.
He
yanked
her
hand
away
to
keep
her
from
further
mischief.
“This
is
not
the
time
for
bed
sport,
Shae.
Your
life
may
be
at
stake.”

Her
grin
was
gone.
“If
I’ve
displeased
m’lord,
I
never
meant
it,
only…
couldn’t
you
just
give
me
more
guards?”

Tyrion
breathed
a
deep
sigh.
Remember
how
young
she
is,
he
told
himself.
He
took
her
hand.
“Your
gems
can
be
replaced,
and
new
gowns
can
be
sewn
twice
as
lovely
as
the
old.
To
me,
you’re
the
most
precious
thing
within
these
walls.
The
Red
Keep
is
not
safe
either,
but
it’s
a
deal
safer
than
here.
I
want
you
there.”

“In
the
kitchens.”
Her
voice
was
flat.
“Scouring
pots.”

“For
a
short
while.”

“My
father
made
me
his
kitchen
wench,”
she
said,
her
mouth
twisting.
“That
was
why
I
ran
off.”

“You
told
me
you
ran
off
because
your
father
made
you
his
whore,”
he
reminded
her.

“That
too.
I
didn’t
like
scouring
his
pots
no
more
than
I
liked
his
cock
in
me.”
She
tossed
her
head.
“Why
can’t
you
keep
me
in
your
tower?
Half
the
lords
at
court
keep
bedwarmers.”

“I
was
expressly
forbidden
to
take
you
to
court.”

“By
your
stupid
father.”
Shae
pouted.
“You’re
old
enough
to
keep
all
the
whores
you
want.
Does
he
take
you
for
a
beardless
boy?
What
could
he
do,
spank
you?”

He
slapped
her.
Not
hard,
but
hard
enough.
“Damn
you,”
he
said.
“Damn
you.
Never
mock
me.
Not
you.”

For
a
moment
Shae
did
not
speak.
The
only
sound
was
the
cricket,
chirping,
chirping.
“Beg
pardon,
m’lord,”
she
said
at
last,
in
a
heavy
wooden
voice.
“I
never
meant
to
be
impudent.”

And
I
never
meant
to
strike
you.
Gods
be
good,
am
I
turning
into
Cersei?
“That
was
ill
done,”
he
said.
“On
both
our
parts.
Shae,
you
do
not
understand.”
Words
he
had
never
meant
to
speak
came
tumbling
out
of
him
like
mummers
from
a
hollow
horse.
“When
I
was
thirteen,
I
wed
a
crofter’s
daughter.
Or
so
I
thought
her.
I
was
blind
with
love
for
her,
and
thought
she
felt
the
same
for
me,
but
my
father
rubbed
my
face
in
the
truth.
My
bride
was
a
whore
Jaime
had
hired
to
give
me
my
first
taste
of
manhood.”
And
I
believed
all
of
it,
fool
that
I
was.
“To
drive
the
lesson
home,
Lord
Tywin
gave
my
wife
to
a
barracks
of
his
guardsmen
to
use
as
they
pleased,
and
commanded
me
to
watch.”
And
to
take
her
one
last
time,
after
the
rest
were
done.
One
last
time,
with
no
trace
of
love
or
tenderness
remaining.
“So
you
will
remember
her
as
she
truly
is,”
he
said,
and
I
should
have
defied
him,
but
my
cock
betrayed
me,
and
I
did
as
I
was
bid.
“After
he
was
done
with
her,
my
father
had
the
marriage
undone.
It
was
as
if
we
had
never
been
wed,
the
septons
said.”
He
squeezed
her
hand.
“Please,
let’s
have
no
more
talk
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
You
will
be
in
the
kitchens
only
a
little
while.
Once
we’re
done
with
Stannis,
you’ll
have
another
manse,
and
silks
as
soft
as
your
hands.”

Shae’s
eyes
had
grown
large
but
he
could
not
read
what
lay
behind
them.
“My
hands
won’t
be
soft
if
I
clean
ovens
and
scrape
plates
all
day.
Will
you
still
want
them
touching
you
when
they’re
all
red
and
raw
and
cracked
from
hot
water
and
lye
soap?”

“More
than
ever,”
he
said.
“When
I
look
at
them,
they’ll
remind
me
how
brave
you
were.”

He
could
not
say
if
she
believed
him.
She
lowered
her
eyes.
“I
am
yours
to
command,
m’lord.”

It
was
as
much
acceptance
as
she
could
give
tonight,
he
saw
that
plain
enough.
He
kissed
her
cheek
where
he’d
struck
her,
to
take
some
sting
from
the
blow.
“I
will
send
for
you.”

Varys
was
waiting
in
the
stables,
as
promised.
His
horse
looked
spavined
and
half-dead.
Tyrion
mounted
up;
one
of
the
sellswords
opened
the
gates.
They
rode
out
in
silence.
Why
did
I
tell
her
about
Tysha,
gods
help
me?
he
asked
himself,
suddenly
afraid.
There
were
some
secrets
that
should
never
be
spoken,
some
shames
a
man
should
take
to
his
grave.
What
did
he
want
from
her,
forgiveness?
The
way
she
had
looked
at
him,
what
did
that
mean?
Did
she
hate
the
thought
of
scouring
pots
that
much,
or
was
it
his
confession?
How
could
I
tell
her
that
and
still
think
she
would
love
me?
part
of
him
said,
and
another
part
mocked,
saying,
Fool
of
a
dwarf,
it
is
only
the
gold
and
jewels
the
whore
loves.

His
scarred
elbow
was
throbbing,
jarred
every
time
the
horse
set
down
a
hoof.
Sometimes
he
could
almost
fancy
he
heard
the
bones
grinding
together
inside.
Perhaps
he
should
see
a
maester,
get
some
potion
for
the
pain…
but
since
Pycelle
had
revealed
himself
for
what
he
was,
Tyrion
Lannister
mistrusted
the
maesters.
The
gods
only
knew
who
they
were
conspiring
with,
or
what
they
had
mixed
in
those
potions
they
gave
you.
“Varys,”
he
said.
“I
need
to
bring
Shae
into
the
castle
without
Cersei
becoming
aware.”
Briefly,
he
sketched
out
his
kitchen
scheme.

When
he
was
done,
the
eunuch
made
a
little
clucking
sound.
“I
will
do
as
my
lord
commands,
of
course…
but
I
must
warn
you,
the
kitchens
are
full
of
eyes
and
ears.
Even
if
the
girl
falls
under
no
particular
suspicion,
she
will
be
subject
to
a
thousand
questions.
Where
was
she
born?
Who
were
her
parents?
How
did
she
come
to
King’s
Landing?
The
truth
will
never
do,
so
she
must
lie…
and
lie,
and
lie.”
He
glanced
down
at
Tyrion.
“And
such
a
pretty
young
kitchen
wench
will
incite
lust
as
well
as
curiosity.
She
will
be
touched,
pinched,
patted,
and
fondled.
Pot
boys
will
crawl
under
her
blankets
of
a
night.
Some
lonely
cook
may
seek
to
wed
her.
Bakers
will
knead
her
breasts
with
floured
hands.”

“I’d
sooner
have
her
fondled
than
stabbed,”
said
Tyrion.

Varys
rode
on
a
few
paces
and
said,
“It
might
be
that
there
is
another
way.
As
it
happens,
the
maidservant
who
attends
Lady
Tanda’s
daughter
has
been
filching
her
jewels.
Were
I
to
inform
Lady
Tanda,
she
would
be
forced
to
dismiss
the
girl
at
once.
And
the
daughter
would
require
a
new
maidservant.”

“I
see.”
This
had
possibilities,
Tyrion
saw
at
once.
A
lady’s
bedmaid
wore
finer
garb
than
a
scullion,
and
often
even
a
jewel
or
two.
Shae
should
be
pleased
by
that.
And
Cersei
thought
Lady
Tanda
tedious
and
hysterical,
and
Lollys
a
bovine
lackwit.
She
was
not
like
to
pay
them
any
friendly
calls.

“Lollys
is
timid
and
trusting,”
Varys
said.
“She
will
accept
any
tale
she
is
told.
Since
the
mob
took
her
maidenhood
she
is
afraid
to
leave
her
chambers,
so
Shae
will
be
out
of
sight…
but
conveniently
close,
should
you
have
need
of
comfort.”

“The
Tower
of
the
Hand
is
watched,
you
know
as
well
as
I.
Cersei
would
be
certain
to
grow
curious
if
Lollys’s
bedmaid
starting
paying
me
calls.”

“I
might
be
able
to
slip
the
child
into
your
bedchamber
unseen.
Chataya’s
is
not
the
only
house
to
boast
a
hidden
door.”

“A
secret
access?
To
my
chambers?”
Tyrion
was
more
annoyed
than
surprised.
Why
else
would
Maegor
the
Cruel
have
ordered
death
for
all
the
builders
who
had
worked
on
his
castle,
except
to
preserve
such
secrets?
“Yes,
I
suppose
there
would
be.
Where
will
I
find
the
door?
In
my
solar?
My
bedchamber?”

“My
friend,
you
would
not
force
me
to
reveal
all
my
little
secrets,
would
you?”

“Henceforth
think
of
them
as
our
little
secrets,
Varys.”
Tyrion
glanced
up
at
the
eunuch
in
his
smelly
mummer’s
garb.
“Assuming
you
are
on
my
side…”

“Can
you
doubt
it?”

“Why
no,
I
trust
you
implicitly.”
A
bitter
laugh
echoed
off
the
shuttered
windows.
“I
trust
you
like
one
of
my
own
blood,
in
truth.
Now
tell
me
how
Cortnay
Penrose
died.”

“It
is
said
that
he
threw
himself
from
a
tower.”

“Threw
himself?
No,
I
will
not
believe
that!”

“His
guards
saw
no
man
enter
his
chambers,
nor
did
they
find
any
within
afterward.”

“Then
the
killer
entered
earlier
and
hid
under
the
bed,”
Tyrion
suggested,
“or
he
climbed
down
from
the
roof
on
a
rope.
Perhaps
the
guards
are
lying.
Who’s
to
say
they
did
not
do
the
thing
themselves?”

“Doubtless
you
are
right,
my
lord.”

His
smug
tone
said
otherwise.
“But
you
do
not
think
so?
How
was
it
done,
then?”

For
a
long
moment
Varys
said
nothing.
The
only
sound
was
the
stately
clack
of
horseshoes
on
cobbles.
Finally
the
eunuch
cleared
his
throat.
“My
lord,
do
you
believe
in
the
old
powers?”

“Magic,
you
mean?”
Tyrion
said
impatiently.
“Bloodspells,
curses,
shapeshifting,
those
sorts
of
things?”
He
snorted.
“Do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
Ser
Cortnay
was
magicked
to
his
death?”

“Ser
Cortnay
had
challenged
Lord
Stannis
to
single
combat
on
the
morning
he
died.
I
ask
you,
is
this
the
act
of
a
man
lost
to
despair?
Then
there
is
the
matter
of
Lord
Renly’s
mysterious
and
most
fortuitous
murder,
even
as
his
battle
lines
were
forming
up
to
sweep
his
brother
from
the
field.”
The
eunuch
paused
a
moment.
“My
lord,
you
once
asked
me
how
it
was
that
I
was
cut.”

“I
recall,”
said
Tyrion.
“You
did
not
want
to
talk
of
it.”

“Nor
do
I,
but…”
This
pause
was
longer
than
the
one
before,
and
when
Varys
spoke
again
his
voice
was
different
somehow.
“I
was
an
orphan
boy
apprenticed
to
a
traveling
folly.
Our
master
owned
a
fat
little
cog
and
we
sailed
up
and
down
the
narrow
sea
performing
in
all
the
Free
Cities
and
from
time
to
time
in
Oldtown
and
King’s
Landing.

“One
day
at
Myr,
a
certain
man
came
to
our
folly.
After
the
performance,
he
made
an
offer
for
me
that
my
master
found
too
tempting
to
refuse.
I
was
in
terror.
I
feared
the
man
meant
to
use
me
as
I
had
heard
men
used
small
boys,
but
in
truth
the
only
part
of
me
he
had
need
of
was
my
manhood.
He
gave
me
a
potion
that
made
me
powerless
to
move
or
speak,
yet
did
nothing
to
dull
my
senses.
With
a
long
hooked
blade,
he
sliced
me
root
and
stem,
chanting
all
the
while.
I
watched
him
burn
my
manly
parts
on
a
brazier.
The
flames
turned
blue,
and
I
heard
a
voice
answer
his
call,
though
I
did
not
understand
the
words
they
spoke.

“The
mummers
had
sailed
by
the
time
he
was
done
with
me.
Once
I
had
served
his
purpose,
the
man
had
no
further
interest
in
me,
so
he
put
me
out.
When
I
asked
him
what
I
should
do
now,
he
answered
that
he
supposed
I
should
die.
To
spite
him,
I
resolved
to
live.
I
begged,
I
stole,
and
I
sold
what
parts
of
my
body
still
remained
to
me.
Soon
I
was
as
good
a
thief
as
any
in
Myr,
and
when
I
was
older
I
learned
that
often
the
contents
of
a
man’s
letters
are
more
valuable
than
the
contents
of
his
purse.

“Yet
I
still
dream
of
that
night,
my
lord.
Not
of
the
sorcerer,
nor
his
blade,
nor
even
the
way
my
manhood
shriveled
as
it
burned.
I
dream
of
the
voice.
The
voice
from
the
flames.
Was
it
a
god,
a
demon,
some
conjurer’s
trick?
I
could
not
tell
you,
and
I
know
all
the
tricks.
All
I
can
say
for
a
certainty
is
that
he
called
it,
and
it
answered,
and
since
that
day
I
have
hated
magic
and
all
those
who
practice
it.
If
Lord
Stannis
is
one
such,
I
mean
to
see
him
dead.”

When
he
was
done,
they
rode
in
silence
for
a
time.
Finally
Tyrion
said,
“A
harrowing
tale.
I’m
sorry.”

The
eunuch
sighed.
“You
are
sorry,
but
you
do
not
believe
me.
No,
my
lord,
no
need
to
apologize.
I
was
drugged
and
in
pain
and
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
and
far
across
the
sea.
No
doubt
I
dreamed
that
voice.
I’ve
told
myself
as
much
a
thousand
times.”

“I
believe
in
steel
swords,
gold
coins,
and
men’s
wits,”
said
Tyrion.
“And
I
believe
there
once
were
dragons.
I’ve
seen
their
skulls,
after
all.”

“Let
us
hope
that
is
the
worst
thing
you
ever
see,
my
lord.”

“On
that
we
agree.”
Tyrion
smiled.
“And
for
Ser
Cortnay’s
death,
well,
we
know
Stannis
hired
sellsails
from
the
Free
Cities.
Perhaps
he
bought
himself
a
skilled
assassin
as
well.”

“A
very
skilled
assassin.”

“There
are
such.
I
used
to
dream
that
one
day
I’d
be
rich
enough
to
send
a
Faceless
Man
after
my
sweet
sister.”

“Regardless
of
how
Ser
Cortnay
died,”
said
Varys,
“he
is
dead,
the
castle
fallen.
Stannis
is
free
to
march.”

“Any
chance
we
might
convince
the
Dornishmen
to
descend
on
the
Marches?”
asked
Tyrion.

“None.”

“A
pity.
Well,
the
threat
may
serve
to
keep
the
Marcher
lords
close
to
their
castles,
at
least.
What
news
of
my
father?”

“If
Lord
Tywin
has
won
across
the
Red
Fork,
no
word
has
reached
me
yet.
If
he
does
not
hasten,
he
may
be
trapped
between
his
foes.
The
Oakheart
leaf
and
the
Rowan
tree
have
been
seen
north
of
the
Mander.”

“No
word
from
Littlefinger?”

“Perhaps
he
never
reached
Bitterbridge.
Or
perhaps
he’s
died
there.
Lord
Tarly
has
seized
Renly’s
stores
and
put
a
great
many
to
the
sword;
Florents,
chiefly.
Lord
Caswell
has
shut
himself
up
in
his
castle.”

Tyrion
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed.

Varys
reined
up,
nonplussed.
“My
lord?”

“Don’t
you
see
the
jest,
Lord
Varys?”
Tyrion
waved
a
hand
at
the
shuttered
windows,
at
all
the
sleeping
city.
“Storm’s
End
is
fallen
and
Stannis
is
coming
with
fire
and
steel
and
the
gods
alone
know
what
dark
powers,
and
the
good
folk
don’t
have
Jaime
to
protect
them,
nor
Robert
nor
Renly
nor
Rhaegar
nor
their
precious
Knight
of
Flowers.
Only
me,
the
one
they
hate.”
He
laughed
again.
“The
dwarf,
the
evil
counselor,
the
twisted
little
monkey
demon.
I’m
all
that
stands
between
them
and
chaos.”





CATELYN

“Tell
Father
I
have
gone
to
make
him
proud.”
Her
brother
swung
up
into
his
saddle,
every
inch
the
lord
in
his
bright
mail
and
flowing
mud-and-water
cloak.
A
silver
trout
ornamented
the
crest
of
his
greathelm,
twin
to
the
one
painted
on
his
shield.

“He
was
always
proud
of
you,
Edmure.
And
he
loves
you
fiercely.
Believe
that.”

“I
mean
to
give
him
better
reason
than
mere
birth.”
He
wheeled
his
warhorse
about
and
raised
a
hand.
Trumpets
sounded,
a
drum
began
to
boom,
the
drawbridge
descended
in
fits
and
starts,
and
Ser
Edmure
Tully
led
his
men
out
from
Riverrun
with
lances
raised
and
banners
streaming.

I
have
a
greater
host
than
yours,
brother,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
watched
them
go.
A
host
of
doubts
and
fears.

Beside
her,
Brienne’s
misery
was
almost
palpable.
Catelyn
had
ordered
garments
sewn
to
her
measure,
handsome
gowns
to
suit
her
birth
and
sex,
yet
still
she
preferred
to
dress
in
oddments
of
mail
and
boiled
leather,
a
swordbelt
cinched
around
her
waist.
She
would
have
been
happier
riding
to
war
with
Edmure,
no
doubt,
but
even
walls
as
strong
as
Riverrun’s
required
swords
to
hold
them.
Her
brother
had
taken
every
able-bodied
man
for
the
fords,
leaving
Ser
Desmond
Grell
to
command
a
garrison
made
up
of
the
wounded,
the
old,
and
the
sick,
along
with
a
few
squires
and
some
untrained
peasant
boys
still
shy
of
manhood.
This,
to
defend
a
castle
crammed
full
of
women
and
children.

When
the
last
of
Edmure’s
foot
had
shuffled
under
the
portcullis,
Brienne
asked,
“What
shall
we
do
now,
my
lady?”

“Our
duty.”
Catelyn’s
face
was
drawn
as
she
started
across
the
yard.
I
have
always
done
my
duty,
she
thought.
Perhaps
that
was
why
her
lord
father
had
always
cherished
her
best
of
all
his
children.
Her
two
older
brothers
had
both
died
in
infancy,
so
she
had
been
son
as
well
as
daughter
to
Lord
Hoster
until
Edmure
was
born.
Then
her
mother
had
died
and
her
father
had
told
her
that
she
must
be
the
lady
of
Riverrun
now,
and
she
had
done
that
too.
And
when
Lord
Hoster
promised
her
to
Brandon
Stark,
she
had
thanked
him
for
making
her
such
a
splendid
match.

I
gave
Brandon
my
favor
to
wear,
and
never
comforted
Petyr
once
after
he
was
wounded,
nor
bid
him
farewell
when
Father
sent
him
off.
And
when
Brandon
was
murdered
and
Father
told
me
I
must
wed
his
brother,
I
did
so
gladly,
though
I
never
saw
Ned’s
face
until
our
wedding
day.
I
gave
my
maidenhood
to
this
solemn
stranger
and
sent
him
off
to
his
war
and
his
king
and
the
woman
who
bore
him
his
bastard,
because
I
always
did
my
duty.

Her
steps
took
her
to
the
sept,
a
seven-sided
sandstone
temple
set
amidst
her
mother’s
gardens
and
filled
with
rainbow
light.
It
was
crowded
when
they
entered;
Catelyn
was
not
alone
in
her
need
for
prayer.
She
knelt
before
the
painted
marble
image
of
the
Warrior
and
lit
a
scented
candle
for
Edmure
and
another
for
Robb
off
beyond
the
hills.
Keep
them
safe
and
help
them
to
victory,
she
prayed,
and
bring
peace
to
the
souls
of
the
slain
and
comfort
to
those
they
leave
behind.

The
septon
entered
with
his
censer
and
crystal
while
she
was
at
her
prayers,
so
Catelyn
lingered
for
the
celebration.
She
did
not
know
this
septon,
an
earnest
young
man
close
to
Edmure’s
age.
He
performed
his
office
well
enough,
and
his
voice
was
rich
and
pleasant
when
he
sang
the
praises
to
the
Seven,
but
Catelyn
found
herself
yearning
for
the
thin
quavering
tones
of
Septon
Osmynd,
long
dead.
Osmynd
would
have
listened
patiently
to
the
tale
of
what
she
had
seen
and
felt
in
Renly’s
pavilion,
and
he
might
have
known
what
it
meant
as
well,
and
what
she
must
do
to
lay
to
rest
the
shadows
that
stalked
her
dreams.
Osmynd,
my
father,
Uncle
Brynden,
old
Maester
Kym,
they
always
seemed
to
know
everything,
but
now
there
is
only
me,
and
it
seems
I
know
nothing,
not
even
my
duty.
How
can
I
do
my
duty
if
I
do
not
know
where
it
lies?

Catelyn’s
knees
were
stiff
by
the
time
she
rose,
though
she
felt
no
wiser.
Perhaps
she
would
go
to
the
godswood
tonight,
and
pray
to
Ned’s
gods
as
well.
They
were
older
than
the
Seven.

Outside,
she
found
song
of
a
very
different
sort.
Rymund
the
Rhymer
sat
by
the
brewhouse
amidst
a
circle
of
listeners,
his
deep
voice
ringing
as
he
sang
of
Lord
Deremond
at
the
Bloody
Meadow.

And
there
he
stood
with
sword
in
hand,

the
last
of
Darry’s
ten…

Brienne
paused
to
listen
for
a
moment,
broad
shoulders
hunched
and
thick
arms
crossed
against
her
chest.
A
mob
of
ragged
boys
raced
by,
screeching
and
flailing
at
each
other
with
sticks.
Why
do
boys
so
love
to
play
at
war?
Catelyn
wondered
if
Rymund
was
the
answer.
The
singer’s
voice
swelled
as
he
neared
the
end
of
his
song.

And
red
the
grass
beneath
his
feet,

and
red
his
banners
bright,

and
red
the
glow
of
setting
sun

that
bathed
him
in
its
light.

“Come
on,
come
on,”
the
great
lord
called,

“my
sword
is
hungry
still.”

And
with
a
cry
of
savage
rage,

They
swarmed
across
the
rill…

“Fighting
is
better
than
this
waiting,”
Brienne
said.
“You
don’t
feel
so
helpless
when
you
fight.
You
have
a
sword
and
a
horse,
sometimes
an
axe.
When
you’re
armored
it’s
hard
for
anyone
to
hurt
you.”

“Knights
die
in
battle,”
Catelyn
reminded
her.

Brienne
looked
at
her
with
those
blue
and
beautiful
eyes.
“As
ladies
die
in
childbed.
No
one
sings
songs
about
them.”

“Children
are
a
battle
of
a
different
sort.”
Catelyn
started
across
the
yard.
“A
battle
without
banners
or
warhorns,
but
no
less
fierce.
Carrying
a
child,
bringing
it
into
the
world…
your
mother
will
have
told
you
of
the
pain…”

“I
never
knew
my
mother,”
Brienne
said.
“My
father
had
ladies…
a
different
lady
every
year,
but…”

“Those
were
no
ladies,”
Catelyn
said.
“As
hard
as
birth
can
be,
Brienne,
what
comes
after
is
even
harder.
At
times
I
feel
as
though
I
am
being
torn
apart.
Would
that
there
were
five
of
me,
one
for
each
child,
so
I
might
keep
them
all
safe.”

“And
who
would
keep
you
safe,
my
lady?”

Her
smile
was
wan
and
tired.
“Why,
the
men
of
my
House.
Or
so
my
lady
mother
taught
me.
My
lord
father,
my
brother,
my
uncle,
my
husband,
they
will
keep
me
safe…
but
while
they
are
away
from
me,
I
suppose
you
must
fill
their
place,
Brienne.”

Brienne
bowed
her
head.
“I
shall
try,
my
lady.”

Later
that
day,
Maester
Vyman
brought
a
letter.
She
saw
him
at
once,
hoping
for
some
word
from
Robb,
or
from
Ser
Rodrik
in
Winterfell,
but
the
message
proved
to
be
from
one
Lord
Meadows,
who
named
himself
castellan
of
Storm’s
End.
It
was
addressed
to
her
father,
her
brother,
her
son,
“or
whoever
now
holds
Riverrun.”
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
was
dead,
the
man
wrote,
and
Storm’s
End
had
opened
its
gate
to
Stannis
Baratheon,
the
trueborn
and
rightful
heir.
The
castle
garrison
had
sworn
their
swords
to
his
cause,
one
and
all,
and
no
man
of
them
had
suffered
harm.

“Save
Cortnay
Penrose,”
Catelyn
murmured.
She
had
never
met
the
man,
yet
she
grieved
to
hear
of
his
passing.
“Robb
should
know
of
this
at
once,”
she
said.
“Do
we
know
where
he
is?”

“At
last
word
he
was
marching
toward
the
Crag,
the
seat
of
House
Westerling,”
said
Maester
Vyman.
“If
I
dispatched
a
raven
to
Ashemark,
it
may
be
that
they
could
send
a
rider
after
him.”

“Do
so.”

Catelyn
read
the
letter
again
after
the
maester
was
gone.
“Lord
Meadows
says
nothing
of
Robert’s
bastard,”
she
confided
to
Brienne.
“I
suppose
he
yielded
the
boy
with
the
rest,
though
I
confess,
I
do
not
understand
why
Stannis
wanted
him
so
badly.”

“Perhaps
he
fears
the
boy’s
claim.”

“A
bastard’s
claim?
No,
it’s
something
else…
what
does
this
child
look
like?”

“He
is
seven
or
eight,
comely,
with
black
hair
and
bright
blue
eyes.
Visitors
oft
thought
him
Lord
Renly’s
own
son.”

“And
Renly
favored
Robert.”
Catelyn
had
a
glimmer
of
understanding.
“Stannis
means
to
parade
his
brother’s
bastard
before
the
realm,
so
men
might
see
Robert
in
his
face
and
wonder
why
there
is
no
such
likeness
in
Joffrey.”

“Would
that
mean
so
much?”

“Those
who
favor
Stannis
will
call
it
proof.
Those
who
support
Joffrey
will
say
it
means
nothing.”
Her
own
children
had
more
Tully
about
them
than
Stark.
Arya
was
the
only
one
to
show
much
of
Ned
in
her
features.
And
Jon
Snow,
but
he
was
never
mine.
She
found
herself
thinking
of
Jon’s
mother,
that
shadowy
secret
love
her
husband
would
never
speak
of.
Does
she
grieve
for
Ned
as
I
do?
Or
did
she
hate
him
for
leaving
her
bed
for
mine?
Does
she
pray
for
her
son
as
I
have
prayed
for
mine?

They
were
uncomfortable
thoughts,
and
futile.
If
Jon
had
been
born
of
Ashara
Dayne
of
Starfall,
as
some
whispered,
the
lady
was
long
dead;
if
not,
Catelyn
had
no
clue
who
or
where
his
mother
might
be.
And
it
made
no
matter.
Ned
was
gone
now,
and
his
loves
and
his
secrets
had
all
died
with
him.

Still,
she
was
struck
again
by
how
strangely
men
behaved
when
it
came
to
their
bastards.
Ned
had
always
been
fiercely
protective
of
Jon,
and
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
had
given
up
his
life
for
this
Edric
Storm,
yet
Roose
Bolton’s
bastard
had
meant
less
to
him
than
one
of
his
dogs,
to
judge
from
the
tone
of
the
queer
cold
letter
Edmure
had
gotten
from
him
not
three
days
past.
He
had
crossed
the
Trident
and
was
marching
on
Harrenhal
as
commanded,
he
wrote.
“A
strong
castle,
and
well
garrisoned,
but
His
Grace
shall
have
it,
if
I
must
kill
every
living
soul
within
to
make
it
so.”
He
hoped
His
Grace
would
weigh
that
against
the
crimes
of
his
bastard
son,
whom
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
had
put
to
death.
“A
fate
he
no
doubt
earned,”
Bolton
had
written.
“Tainted
blood
is
ever
treacherous,
and
Ramsay’s
nature
was
sly,
greedy,
and
cruel.
I
count
myself
well
rid
of
him.
The
trueborn
sons
my
young
wife
has
promised
me
would
never
have
been
safe
while
he
lived.”

The
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
drove
the
morbid
thoughts
from
her
head.
Ser
Desmond’s
squire
dashed
panting
into
the
room
and
knelt.
“My
lady…
Lannisters…
across
the
river.”

“Take
a
long
breath,
lad,
and
tell
it
slowly.”

He
did
as
she
bid
him.
“A
column
of
armored
men,”
he
reported.
“Across
the
Red
Fork.
They
are
flying
a
purple
unicorn
below
the
lion
of
Lannister.”

Some
son
of
Lord
Brax.
Brax
had
come
to
Riverrun
once
when
she
was
a
girl,
to
propose
wedding
one
of
his
sons
to
her
or
Lysa.
She
wondered
whether
it
was
this
same
son
out
there
now,
leading
the
attack.

The
Lannisters
had
ridden
out
of
the
southeast
beneath
a
blaze
of
banners,
Ser
Desmond
told
her
when
she
ascended
to
the
battlements
to
join
him.
“A
few
outriders,
no
more,”
he
assured
her.
“The
main
strength
of
Lord
Tywin’s
host
is
well
to
the
south.
We
are
in
no
danger
here.”

South
of
the
Red
Fork
the
land
stretched
away
open
and
flat.
From
the
watchtower
Catelyn
could
see
for
miles.
Even
so,
only
the
nearest
ford
was
visible.
Edmure
had
entrusted
Lord
Jason
Mallister
with
its
defense,
as
well
as
that
of
three
others
farther
upriver.
The
Lannister
riders
were
milling
about
uncertainly
near
the
water,
crimson
and
silver
banners
flapping
in
the
wind.
“No
more
than
fifty,
my
lady,”
Ser
Desmond
estimated.

Catelyn
watched
the
riders
spread
out
in
a
long
line.
Lord
Jason’s
men
waited
to
receive
them
behind
rocks
and
grass
and
hillocks.
A
trumpet
blast
sent
the
horsemen
forward
at
a
ponderous
walk,
splashing
down
into
the
current.
For
a
moment
they
made
a
brave
show,
all
bright
armor
and
streaming
banners,
the
sun
flashing
off
the
points
of
their
lances.

“Now,”
she
heard
Brienne
mutter.

It
was
hard
to
make
out
what
was
happening,
but
the
screams
of
the
horses
seemed
loud
even
at
this
remove,
and
beneath
them
Catelyn
heard
the
fainter
clash
of
steel
on
steel.
A
banner
vanished
suddenly
as
its
bearer
was
swept
under,
and
soon
after
the
first
dead
man
drifted
past
their
walls,
borne
along
by
the
current.
By
then
the
Lannisters
had
pulled
back
in
confusion.
She
watched
as
they
re-formed,
conferred
briefly,
and
galloped
back
the
way
they
had
come.
The
men
on
the
walls
shouted
taunts
after
them,
though
they
were
already
too
far
off
to
hear.

Ser
Desmond
slapped
his
belly.
“Would
that
Lord
Hoster
could
have
seen
that.
It
would
have
made
him
dance.”

“My
father’s
dancing
days
are
past,
I
fear,”
Catelyn
said,
“and
this
fight
is
just
begun.
The
Lannisters
will
come
again.
Lord
Tywin
has
twice
my
brother’s
numbers.”

“He
could
have
ten
times
and
it
would
not
matter,”
Ser
Desmond
said.
“The
west
bank
of
the
Red
Fork
is
higher
than
the
east,
my
lady,
and
well
wooded.
Our
bowmen
have
good
cover,
and
a
clear
field
for
their
shafts…
and
should
any
breach
occur,
Edmure
will
have
his
best
knights
in
reserve,
ready
to
ride
wherever
they
are
most
sorely
needed.
The
river
will
hold
them.”

“I
pray
that
you
are
right,”
Catelyn
said
gravely.

That
night
they
came
again.
She
had
commanded
them
to
wake
her
at
once
if
the
enemy
returned,
and
well
after
midnight
a
serving
girl
touched
her
gently
by
the
shoulder.
Catelyn
sat
up
at
once.
“What
is
it?”

“The
ford
again,
my
lady.”

Wrapped
in
a
bedrobe,
Catelyn
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
keep.
From
there
she
could
see
over
the
walls
and
the
moonlit
river
to
where
the
battle
raged.
The
defenders
had
built
watchfires
along
the
bank,
and
perhaps
the
Lannisters
thought
to
find
them
night-blind
or
unwary.
If
so,
it
was
folly.
Darkness
was
a
chancy
ally
at
best.
As
they
waded
in
to
breast
their
way
across,
men
stepped
in
hidden
pools
and
went
down
splashing,
while
others
stumbled
over
stones
or
gashed
their
feet
on
the
hidden
caltrops.
The
Mallister
bowmen
sent
a
storm
of
fire
arrows
hissing
across
the
river,
strangely
beautiful
from
afar.
One
man,
pierced
through
a
dozen
times,
his
clothes
afire,
danced
and
whirled
in
the
knee-deep
water
until
at
last
he
fell
and
was
swept
downstream.
By
the
time
his
body
came
bobbing
past
Riverrun,
the
fires
and
his
life
had
both
been
extinguished.

A
small
victory,
Catelyn
thought
when
the
fighting
had
ended
and
the
surviving
foemen
had
melted
back
into
the
night,
yet
a
victory
nonetheless.
As
they
descended
the
winding
turret
steps,
Catelyn
asked
Brienne
for
her
thoughts.
“That
was
the
brush
of
Lord
Tywin’s
fingertip,
my
lady,”
the
girl
said.
“He
is
probing,
feeling
for
a
weak
point,
an
undefended
crossing.
If
he
does
not
find
one,
he
will
curl
all
his
fingers
into
a
fist
and
try
and
make
one.”
Brienne
hunched
her
shoulders.
“That’s
what
I’d
do.
Were
I
him.”
Her
hand
went
to
the
hilt
of
her
sword
and
gave
it
a
little
pat,
as
if
to
make
certain
it
was
still
there.

And
may
the
gods
help
us
then,
Catelyn
thought.
Yet
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
it.
That
was
Edmure’s
battle
out
there
on
the
river;
hers
was
here
inside
the
castle.

The
next
morning
as
she
broke
her
fast,
she
sent
for
her
father’s
aged
steward,
Utherydes
Wayn.
“Have
Ser
Cleos
Frey
brought
a
flagon
of
wine.
I
mean
to
question
him
soon,
and
I
want
his
tongue
well
loosened.”
=======
DAENERYS

The
heart
was
steaming
in
the
cool
evening
air
when
Khal
Drogo
set
it
before
her,
raw
and
bloody.
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow.
Behind
him,
his
bloodriders
knelt
on
the
sand
beside
the
corpse
of
the
wild
stallion,
stone
knives
in
their
hands.
The
stallion’s
blood
looked
black
in
the
flickering
orange
glare
of
the
torches
that
ringed
the
high
chalk
walls
of
the
pit.

Dany
touched
the
soft
swell
of
her
belly.
Sweat
beaded
her
skin
and
trickled
down
her
brow.
She
could
feel
the
old
women
watching
her,
the
ancient
crones
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
with
eyes
that
shone
dark
as
polished
flint
in
their
wrinkled
faces.
She
must
not
flinch
or
look
afraid.
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself
as
she
took
the
stallion’s
heart
in
both
hands,
lifted
it
to
her
mouth,
and
plunged
her
teeth
into
the
tough,
stringy
flesh.

Warm
blood
filled
her
mouth
and
ran
down
over
her
chin.
The
taste
threatened
to
gag
her,
but
she
made
herself
chew
and
swallow.
The
heart
of
a
stallion
would
make
her
son
strong
and
swift
and
fearless,
or
so
the
Dothraki
believed,
but
only
if
the
mother
could
eat
it
all.
If
she
choked
on
the
blood
or
retched
up
the
flesh,
the
omens
were
less
favorable;
the
child
might
be
stillborn,
or
come
forth
weak,
deformed,
or
female.

Her
handmaids
had
helped
her
ready
herself
for
the
ceremony.
Despite
the
tender
mother’s
stomach
that
had
afflicted
her
these
past
two
moons,
Dany
had
dined
on
bowls
of
half-clotted
blood
to
accustom
herself
to
the
taste,
and
Irri
made
her
chew
strips
of
dried
horseflesh
until
her
jaws
were
aching.
She
had
starved
herself
for
a
day
and
a
night
before
the
ceremony
in
the
hopes
that
hunger
would
help
her
keep
down
the
raw
meat.

The
wild
stallion’s
heart
was
all
muscle,
and
Dany
had
to
worry
it
with
her
teeth
and
chew
each
mouthful
a
long
time.
No
steel
was
permitted
within
the
sacred
confines
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Mother
of
Mountains;
she
had
to
rip
the
heart
apart
with
teeth
and
nails.
Her
stomach
roiled
and
heaved,
yet
she
kept
on,
her
face
smeared
with
the
heartsblood
that
sometimes
seemed
to
explode
against
her
lips.

Khal
Drogo
stood
over
her
as
she
ate,
his
face
as
hard
as
a
bronze
shield.
His
long
black
braid
was
shiny
with
oil.
He
wore
gold
rings
in
his
mustache,
gold
bells
in
his
braid,
and
a
heavy
belt
of
solid
gold
medallions
around
his
waist,
but
his
chest
was
bare.
She
looked
at
him
whenever
she
felt
her
strength
failing;
looked
at
him,
and
chewed
and
swallowed,
chewed
and
swallowed,
chewed
and
swallowed.
Toward
the
end,
Dany
thought
she
glimpsed
a
fierce
pride
in
his
dark,
almond-shaped
eyes,
but
she
could
not
be
sure.
The
khal’s
face
did
not
often
betray
the
thoughts
within.

And
finally
it
was
done.
Her
cheeks
and
fingers
were
sticky
as
she
forced
down
the
last
of
it.
Only
then
did
she
turn
her
eyes
back
to
the
old
women,
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen.

“Khalakka
dothrae
mr’anha!”
she
proclaimed
in
her
best
Dothraki.
A
prince
rides
inside
me!
She
had
practiced
the
phrase
for
days
with
her
handmaid
Jhiqui.

The
oldest
of
the
crones,
a
bent
and
shriveled
stick
of
a
woman
with
a
single
black
eye,
raised
her
arms
on
high.
“Khalakka
dothrae!”
she
shrieked.
The
prince
is
riding!

“He
is
riding!”
the
other
women
answered.
“Rakh!
Rakh!
Rakh
haj!”
they
proclaimed.
A
boy,
a
boy,
a
strong
boy.

Bells
rang,
a
sudden
clangor
of
bronze
birds.
A
deep-throated
warhorn
sounded
its
long
low
note.
The
old
women
began
to
chant.
Underneath
their
painted
leather
vests,
their
withered
dugs
swayed
back
and
forth,
shiny
with
oil
and
sweat.
The
eunuchs
who
served
them
threw
bundles
of
dried
grasses
into
a
great
bronze
brazier,
and
clouds
of
fragrant
smoke
rose
up
toward
the
moon
and
the
stars.
The
Dothraki
believed
the
stars
were
horses
made
of
fire,
a
great
herd
that
galloped
across
the
sky
by
night.

As
the
smoke
ascended,
the
chanting
died
away
and
the
ancient
crone
closed
her
single
eye,
the
better
to
peer
into
the
future.
The
silence
that
fell
was
complete.
Dany
could
hear
the
distant
call
of
night
birds,
the
hiss
and
crackle
of
the
torches,
the
gentle
lapping
of
water
from
the
lake.
The
Dothraki
stared
at
her
with
eyes
of
night,
waiting.

Khal
Drogo
laid
his
hand
on
Dany’s
arm.
She
could
feel
the
tension
in
his
fingers.
Even
a
khal
as
mighty
as
Drogo
could
know
fear
when
the
dosh
khaleen
peered
into
smoke
of
the
future.
At
her
back,
her
handmaids
fluttered
anxiously.

Finally
the
crone
opened
her
eye
and
lifted
her
arms.
“I
have
seen
his
face,
and
heard
the
thunder
of
his
hooves,”
she
proclaimed
in
a
thin,
wavery
voice.

“The
thunder
of
his
hooves!”
the
others
chorused.

“As
swift
as
the
wind
he
rides,
and
behind
him
his
khalasar
covers
the
earth,
men
without
number,
with
arakhs
shining
in
their
hands
like
blades
of
razor
grass.
Fierce
as
a
storm
this
prince
will
be.
His
enemies
will
tremble
before
him,
and
their
wives
will
weep
tears
of
blood
and
rend
their
flesh
in
grief.
The
bells
in
his
hair
will
sing
his
coming,
and
the
milk
men
in
the
stone
tents
will
fear
his
name.”
The
old
woman
trembled
and
looked
at
Dany
almost
as
if
she
were
afraid.
“The
prince
is
riding,
and
he
shall
be
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”

“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world!”
the
onlookers
cried
in
echo,
until
the
night
rang
to
the
sound
of
their
voices.

The
one-eyed
crone
peered
at
Dany.
“What
shall
he
be
called,
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world?”

She
stood
to
answer.
“He
shall
be
called
Rhaego,”
she
said,
using
the
words
that
Jhiqui
had
taught
her.
Her
hands
touched
the
swell
beneath
her
breasts
protectively
as
a
roar
went
up
from
the
Dothraki.
“Rhaego,”
they
screamed.
“Rhaego,
Rhaego,
Rhaego!”

The
name
was
still
ringing
in
her
ears
as
Khal
Drogo
led
her
from
the
pit.
His
bloodriders
fell
in
behind
them.
A
procession
followed
them
out
onto
the
godsway,
the
broad
grassy
road
that
ran
through
the
heart
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
from
the
horse
gate
to
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
The
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
came
first,
with
their
eunuchs
and
slaves.
Some
supported
themselves
with
tall
carved
staffs
as
they
struggled
along
on
ancient,
shaking
legs,
while
others
walked
as
proud
as
any
horselord.
Each
of
the
old
women
had
been
a
khaleesi
once.
When
their
lord
husbands
died
and
a
new
khal
took
his
place
at
the
front
of
his
riders,
with
a
new
khaleesi
mounted
beside
him,
they
were
sent
here,
to
reign
over
the
vast
Dothraki
nation.
Even
the
mightiest
of
khals
bowed
to
the
wisdom
and
authority
of
the
dosh
khaleen.
Still,
it
gave
Dany
the
shivers
to
think
that
one
day
she
might
be
sent
to
join
them,
whether
she
willed
it
or
no.

Behind
the
wise
women
came
the
others;
Khal
Ogo
and
his
son,
the
khalakka
Fogo,
Khal
Jommo
and
his
wives,
the
chief
men
of
Drogo’s
khalasar,
Dany’s
handmaids,
the
khal’s
servants
and
slaves,
and
more.
Bells
rang
and
drums
beat
a
stately
cadence
as
they
marched
along
the
godsway.
Stolen
heroes
and
the
gods
of
dead
peoples
brooded
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
road.
Alongside
the
procession,
slaves
ran
lightly
through
the
grass
with
torches
in
their
hands,
and
the
flickering
flames
made
the
great
monuments
seem
almost
alive.

“What
is
meaning,
name
Rhaego?”
Khal
Drogo
asked
as
they
walked,
using
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
She
had
been
teaching
him
a
few
words
when
she
could.
Drogo
was
quick
to
learn
when
he
put
his
mind
to
it,
though
his
accent
was
so
thick
and
barbarous
that
neither
Ser
Jorah
nor
Viserys
could
understand
a
word
he
said.

“My
brother
Rhaegar
was
a
fierce
warrior,
my
sun-and-stars,”
she
told
him.
“He
died
before
I
was
born.
Ser
Jorah
says
that
he
was
the
last
of
the
dragons.”

Khal
Drogo
looked
down
at
her.
His
face
was
a
copper
mask,
yet
under
the
long
black
mustache,
drooping
beneath
the
weight
of
its
gold
rings,
she
thought
she
glimpsed
the
shadow
of
a
smile.
“Is
good
name,
Dan
Ares
wife,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
said.

They
rode
to
the
lake
the
Dothraki
called
the
Womb
of
the
World,
surrounded
by
a
fringe
of
reeds,
its
water
still
and
calm.
A
thousand
thousand
years
ago,
Jhiqui
told
her,
the
first
man
had
emerged
from
its
depths,
riding
upon
the
back
of
the
first
horse.

The
procession
waited
on
the
grassy
shore
as
Dany
stripped
and
let
her
soiled
clothing
fall
to
the
ground.
Naked,
she
stepped
gingerly
into
the
water.
Irri
said
the
lake
had
no
bottom,
but
Dany
felt
soft
mud
squishing
between
her
toes
as
she
pushed
through
the
tall
reeds.
The
moon
floated
on
the
still
black
waters,
shattering
and
re-forming
as
her
ripples
washed
over
it.
Goose
pimples
rose
on
her
pale
skin
as
the
coldness
crept
up
her
thighs
and
kissed
her
lower
lips.
The
stallion’s
blood
had
dried
on
her
hands
and
around
her
mouth.
Dany
cupped
her
fingers
and
lifted
the
sacred
waters
over
her
head,
cleansing
herself
and
the
child
inside
her
while
the
khal
and
the
others
looked
on.
She
heard
the
old
women
of
the
dosh
khaleen
muttering
to
each
other
as
they
watched,
and
wondered
what
they
were
saying.

When
she
emerged
from
the
lake,
shivering
and
dripping,
her
handmaid
Doreah
hurried
to
her
with
a
robe
of
painted
sandsilk,
but
Khal
Drogo
waved
her
away.
He
was
looking
on
her
swollen
breasts
and
the
curve
of
her
belly
with
approval,
and
Dany
could
see
the
shape
of
his
manhood
pressing
through
his
horsehide
trousers,
below
the
heavy
gold
medallions
of
his
belt.
She
went
to
him
and
helped
him
unlace.
Then
her
huge
khal
took
her
by
the
hips
and
lifted
her
into
the
air,
as
he
might
lift
a
child.
The
bells
in
his
hair
rang
softly.

Dany
wrapped
her
arms
around
his
shoulders
and
pressed
her
face
against
his
neck
as
he
thrust
himself
inside
her.
Three
quick
strokes
and
it
was
done.
“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world,”
Drogo
whispered
hoarsely.
His
hands
still
smelled
of
horse
blood.
He
bit
at
her
throat,
hard,
in
the
moment
of
his
pleasure,
and
when
he
lifted
her
off,
his
seed
filled
her
and
trickled
down
the
inside
of
her
thighs.
Only
then
was
Doreah
permitted
to
drape
her
in
the
scented
sandsilk,
and
Irri
to
fit
soft
slippers
to
her
feet.

Khal
Drogo
laced
himself
up
and
spoke
a
command,
and
horses
were
brought
to
the
lakeshore.
Cohollo
had
the
honor
of
helping
the
khaleesi
onto
her
silver.
Drogo
spurred
his
stallion,
and
set
off
down
the
godsway
beneath
the
moon
and
stars.
On
her
silver,
Dany
easily
kept
pace.

The
silk
tenting
that
roofed
Khal
Drogo’s
hall
had
been
rolled
up
tonight,
and
the
moon
followed
them
inside.
Flames
leapt
ten
feet
in
the
air
from
three
huge
stone-lined
firepits.
The
air
was
thick
with
the
smells
of
roasting
meat
and
curdled,
fermented
mare’s
milk.
The
hall
was
crowded
and
noisy
when
they
entered,
the
cushions
packed
with
those
whose
rank
and
name
were
not
sufficient
to
allow
them
at
the
ceremony.
As
Dany
rode
beneath
the
arched
entry
and
up
the
center
aisle,
every
eye
was
on
her.
The
Dothraki
screamed
out
comments
on
her
belly
and
her
breasts,
hailing
the
life
within
her.
She
could
not
understand
all
they
shouted,
but
one
phrase
came
clear.
“The
stallion
that
mounts
the
world,”
she
heard,
bellowed
in
a
thousand
voices.

The
sounds
of
drums
and
horns
swirled
up
into
the
night.
Half-clothed
women
spun
and
danced
on
the
low
tables,
amid
joints
of
meat
and
platters
piled
high
with
plums
and
dates
and
pomegranates.
Many
of
the
men
were
drunk
on
clotted
mare’s
milk,
yet
Dany
knew
no
arakhs
would
clash
tonight,
not
here
in
the
sacred
city,
where
blades
and
bloodshed
were
forbidden.

Khal
Drogo
dismounted
and
took
his
place
on
the
high
bench.
Khal
Jommo
and
Khal
Ogo,
who
had
been
in
Vaes
Dothrak
with
their
khalasars
when
they
arrived,
were
given
seats
of
high
honor
to
Drogo’s
right
and
left.
The
bloodriders
of
the
three
khals
sat
below
them,
and
farther
down
Khal
Jommo’s
four
wives.

Dany
climbed
off
her
silver
and
gave
the
reins
to
one
of
the
slaves.
As
Doreah
and
Irri
arranged
her
cushions,
she
searched
for
her
brother.
Even
across
the
length
of
the
crowded
hall,
Viserys
should
have
been
conspicuous
with
his
pale
skin,
silvery
hair,
and
beggar’s
rags,
but
she
did
not
see
him
anywhere.

Her
glance
roamed
the
crowded
tables
near
the
walls,
where
men
whose
braids
were
even
shorter
than
their
manhoods
sat
on
frayed
rugs
and
flat
cushions
around
the
low
tables,
but
all
the
faces
she
saw
had
black
eyes
and
copper
skin.
She
spied
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
near
the
center
of
the
hall,
close
to
the
middle
firepit.
It
was
a
place
of
respect,
if
not
high
honor;
the
Dothraki
esteemed
the
knight’s
prowess
with
a
sword.
Dany
sent
Jhiqui
to
bring
him
to
her
table.
Mormont
came
at
once,
and
went
to
one
knee
before
her.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said,
“I
am
yours
to
command.”

She
patted
the
stuffed
horsehide
cushion
beside
her.
“Sit
and
talk
with
me.”

“You
honor
me.”
The
knight
seated
himself
cross-legged
on
the
cushion.
A
slave
knelt
before
him,
offering
a
wooden
platter
full
of
ripe
figs.
Ser
Jorah
took
one
and
bit
it
in
half.

“Where
is
my
brother?”
Dany
asked.
“He
ought
to
have
come
by
now,
for
the
feast.”

“I
saw
His
Grace
this
morning,”
he
told
her.
“He
told
me
he
was
going
to
the
Western
Market,
in
search
of
wine.”

“Wine?”
Dany
said
doubtfully.
Viserys
could
not
abide
the
taste
of
the
fermented
mare’s
milk
the
Dothraki
drank,
she
knew
that,
and
he
was
oft
at
the
bazaars
these
days,
drinking
with
the
traders
who
came
in
the
great
caravans
from
east
and
west.
He
seemed
to
find
their
company
more
congenial
than
hers.

“Wine,”
Ser
Jorah
confirmed,
“and
he
has
some
thought
to
recruit
men
for
his
army
from
the
sellswords
who
guard
the
caravans.”
A
serving
girl
laid
a
blood
pie
in
front
of
him,
and
he
attacked
it
with
both
hands.

“Is
that
wise?”
she
asked.
“He
has
no
gold
to
pay
soldiers.
What
if
he’s
betrayed?”
Caravan
guards
were
seldom
troubled
much
by
thoughts
of
honor,
and
the
Usurper
in
King’s
Landing
would
pay
well
for
her
brother’s
head.
“You
ought
to
have
gone
with
him,
to
keep
him
safe.
You
are
his
sworn
sword.”

“We
are
in
Vaes
Dothrak,”
he
reminded
her.
“No
one
may
carry
a
blade
here
or
shed
a
man’s
blood.”

“Yet
men
die,”
she
said.
“Jhogo
told
me.
Some
of
the
traders
have
eunuchs
with
them,
huge
men
who
strangle
thieves
with
wisps
of
silk.
That
way
no
blood
is
shed
and
the
gods
are
not
angered.”

“Then
let
us
hope
your
brother
will
be
wise
enough
not
to
steal
anything.”
Ser
Jorah
wiped
the
grease
off
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
leaned
close
over
the
table.
“He
had
planned
to
take
your
dragon’s
eggs,
until
I
warned
him
that
I’d
cut
off
his
hand
if
he
so
much
as
touched
them.”

For
a
moment
Dany
was
so
shocked
she
had
no
words.
“My
eggs…
but
they’re
mine,
Magister
Illyrio
gave
them
to
me,
a
bride
gift,
why
would
Viserys
want…
they’re
only
stones…”

“The
same
could
be
said
of
rubies
and
diamonds
and
fire
opals,
Princess…
and
dragon’s
eggs
are
rarer
by
far.
Those
traders
he’s
been
drinking
with
would
sell
their
own
manhoods
for
even
one
of
those
stones,
and
with
all
three
Viserys
could
buy
as
many
sellswords
as
he
might
need.”

Dany
had
not
known,
had
not
even
suspected.
“Then…
he
should
have
them.
He
does
not
need
to
steal
them.
He
had
only
to
ask.
He
is
my
brother…
and
my
true
king.”

“He
is
your
brother,”
Ser
Jorah
acknowledged.

“You
do
not
understand,
ser,”
she
said.
“My
mother
died
giving
me
birth,
and
my
father
and
my
brother
Rhaegar
even
before
that.
I
would
never
have
known
so
much
as
their
names
if
Viserys
had
not
been
there
to
tell
me.
He
was
the
only
one
left.
The
only
one.
He
is
all
I
have.”

“Once,”
said
Ser
Jorah.
“No
longer,
Khaleesi.
You
belong
to
the
Dothraki
now.
In
your
womb
rides
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”
He
held
out
his
cup,
and
a
slave
filled
it
with
fermented
mare’s
milk,
sour-smelling
and
thick
with
clots.

Dany
waved
her
away.
Even
the
smell
of
it
made
her
feel
ill,
and
she
would
take
no
chances
of
bringing
up
the
horse
heart
she
had
forced
herself
to
eat.
“What
does
it
mean?”
she
asked.
“What
is
this
stallion?
Everyone
was
shouting
it
at
me,
but
I
don’t
understand.”

“The
stallion
is
the
khal
of
khals
promised
in
ancient
prophecy,
child.
He
will
unite
the
Dothraki
into
a
single
khalasar
and
ride
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,
or
so
it
was
promised.
All
the
people
of
the
world
will
be
his
herd.”

“Oh,”
Dany
said
in
a
small
voice.
Her
hand
smoothed
her
robe
down
over
the
swell
of
her
stomach.
“I
named
him
Rhaego.”

“A
name
to
make
the
Usurper’s
blood
run
cold.”

Suddenly
Doreah
was
tugging
at
her
elbow.
“My
lady,”
the
handmaid
whispered
urgently,
“your
brother…”

Dany
looked
down
the
length
of
the
long,
roofless
hall
and
there
he
was,
striding
toward
her.
From
the
lurch
in
his
step,
she
could
tell
at
once
that
Viserys
had
found
his
wine…
and
something
that
passed
for
courage.

He
was
wearing
his
scarlet
silks,
soiled
and
travel-stained.
His
cloak
and
gloves
were
black
velvet,
faded
from
the
sun.
His
boots
were
dry
and
cracked,
his
silver-blond
hair
matted
and
tangled.
A
longsword
swung
from
his
belt
in
a
leather
scabbard.
The
Dothraki
eyed
the
sword
as
he
passed;
Dany
heard
curses
and
threats
and
angry
muttering
rising
all
around
her,
like
a
tide.
The
music
died
away
in
a
nervous
stammering
of
drums.

A
sense
of
dread
closed
around
her
heart.
“Go
to
him,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.
“Stop
him.
Bring
him
here.
Tell
him
he
can
have
the
dragon’s
eggs
if
that
is
what
he
wants.”
The
knight
rose
swiftly
to
his
feet.

“Where
is
my
sister?”
Viserys
shouted,
his
voice
thick
with
wine.
“I’ve
come
for
her
feast.
How
dare
you
presume
to
eat
without
me?
No
one
eats
before
the
king.
Where
is
she?
The
whore
can’t
hide
from
the
dragon.”

He
stopped
beside
the
largest
of
the
three
firepits,
peering
around
at
the
faces
of
the
Dothraki.
There
were
five
thousand
men
in
the
hall,
but
only
a
handful
who
knew
the
Common
Tongue.
Yet
even
if
his
words
were
incomprehensible,
you
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
know
that
he
was
drunk.

Ser
Jorah
went
to
him
swiftly,
whispered
something
in
his
ear,
and
took
him
by
the
arm,
but
Viserys
wrenched
free.
“Keep
your
hands
off
me!
No
one
touches
the
dragon
without
leave.”

Dany
glanced
anxiously
up
at
the
high
bench.
Khal
Drogo
was
saying
something
to
the
other
khals
beside
him.
Khal
Jommo
grinned,
and
Khal
Ogo
began
to
guffaw
loudly.

The
sound
of
laughter
made
Viserys
lift
his
eyes.
“Khal
Drogo,”
he
said
thickly,
his
voice
almost
polite.
“I’m
here
for
the
feast.”
He
staggered
away
from
Ser
Jorah,
making
to
join
the
three
khals
on
the
high
bench.

Khal
Drogo
rose,
spat
out
a
dozen
words
in
Dothraki,
faster
than
Dany
could
understand,
and
pointed.
“Khal
Drogo
says
your
place
is
not
on
the
high
bench,”
Ser
Jorah
translated
for
her
brother.
“Khal
Drogo
says
your
place
is
there.”

Viserys
glanced
where
the
khal
was
pointing.
At
the
back
of
the
long
hall,
in
a
corner
by
the
wall,
deep
in
shadow
so
better
men
would
not
need
to
look
on
them,
sat
the
lowest
of
the
low;
raw
unblooded
boys,
old
men
with
clouded
eyes
and
stiff
joints,
the
dim-witted
and
the
maimed.
Far
from
the
meat,
and
farther
from
honor.
“That
is
no
place
for
a
king,”
her
brother
declared.

“Is
place,”
Khal
Drogo
answered,
in
the
Common
Tongue
that
Dany
had
taught
him,
“for
Sorefoot
King.”
He
clapped
his
hands
together.
“A
cart!
Bring
cart
for
Khal
Rhaggat!”

Five
thousand
Dothraki
began
to
laugh
and
shout.
Ser
Jorah
was
standing
beside
Viserys,
screaming
in
his
ear,
but
the
roar
in
the
hall
was
so
thunderous
that
Dany
could
not
hear
what
he
was
saying.
Her
brother
shouted
back
and
the
two
men
grappled,
until
Mormont
knocked
Viserys
bodily
to
the
floor.

Her
brother
drew
his
sword.

The
bared
steel
shone
a
fearful
red
in
the
glare
from
the
firepits.
“Keep
away
from
me!”
Viserys
hissed.
Ser
Jorah
backed
off
a
step,
and
her
brother
climbed
unsteadily
to
his
feet.
He
waved
the
sword
over
his
head,
the
borrowed
blade
that
Magister
Illyrio
had
given
him
to
make
him
seem
more
kingly.
Dothraki
were
shrieking
at
him
from
all
sides,
screaming
vile
curses.

Dany
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
terror.
She
knew
what
a
drawn
sword
meant
here,
even
if
her
brother
did
not.

Her
voice
made
Viserys
turn
his
head,
and
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time.
“There
she
is,”
he
said,
smiling.
He
stalked
toward
her,
slashing
at
the
air
as
if
to
cut
a
path
through
a
wall
of
enemies,
though
no
one
tried
to
bar
his
way.

“The
blade…
you
must
not,”
she
begged
him.
“Please,
Viserys.
It
is
forbidden.
Put
down
the
sword
and
come
share
my
cushions.
There’s
drink,
food…
is
it
the
dragon’s
eggs
you
want?
You
can
have
them,
only
throw
away
the
sword.”

“Do
as
she
tells
you,
fool,”
Ser
Jorah
shouted,
“before
you
get
us
all
killed.”

Viserys
laughed.
“They
can’t
kill
us.
They
can’t
shed
blood
here
in
the
sacred
city…
but
I
can.”
He
laid
the
point
of
his
sword
between
Daenerys’s
breasts
and
slid
it
downward,
over
the
curve
of
her
belly.
“I
want
what
I
came
for,”
he
told
her.
“I
want
the
crown
he
promised
me.
He
bought
you,
but
he
never
paid
for
you.
Tell
him
I
want
what
I
bargained
for,
or
I’m
taking
you
back.
You
and
the
eggs
both.
He
can
keep
his
bloody
foal.
I’ll
cut
the
bastard
out
and
leave
it
for
him.”
The
sword
point
pushed
through
her
silks
and
pricked
at
her
navel.
Viserys
was
weeping,
she
saw;
weeping
and
laughing,
both
at
the
same
time,
this
man
who
had
once
been
her
brother.

Distantly,
as
from
far
away,
Dany
heard
her
handmaid
Jhiqui
sobbing
in
fear,
pleading
that
she
dared
not
translate,
that
the
khal
would
bind
her
and
drag
her
behind
his
horse
all
the
way
up
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
She
put
her
arm
around
the
girl.
“Don’t
be
afraid,”
she
said.
“I
shall
tell
him.”

She
did
not
know
if
she
had
enough
words,
yet
when
she
was
done
Khal
Drogo
spoke
a
few
brusque
sentences
in
Dothraki,
and
she
knew
he
understood.
The
sun
of
her
life
stepped
down
from
the
high
bench.
“What
did
he
say?”
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother
asked
her,
flinching.

It
had
grown
so
silent
in
the
hall
that
she
could
hear
the
bells
in
Khal
Drogo’s
hair,
chiming
softly
with
each
step
he
took.
His
bloodriders
followed
him,
like
three
copper
shadows.
Daenerys
had
gone
cold
all
over.
“He
says
you
shall
have
a
splendid
golden
crown
that
men
shall
tremble
to
behold.”

Viserys
smiled
and
lowered
his
sword.
That
was
the
saddest
thing,
the
thing
that
tore
at
her
afterward…
the
way
he
smiled.
“That
was
all
I
wanted,”
he
said.
“What
was
promised.”

When
the
sun
of
her
life
reached
her,
Dany
slid
an
arm
around
his
waist.
The
khal
said
a
word,
and
his
bloodriders
leapt
forward.
Qotho
seized
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother
by
the
arms.
Haggo
shattered
his
wrist
with
a
single,
sharp
twist
of
his
huge
hands.
Cohollo
pulled
the
sword
from
his
limp
fingers.
Even
now
Viserys
did
not
understand.
“No,”
he
shouted,
“you
cannot
touch
me,
I
am
the
dragon,
the
dragon,
and
I
will
be
crowned!”

Khal
Drogo
unfastened
his
belt.
The
medallions
were
pure
gold,
massive
and
ornate,
each
one
as
large
as
a
man’s
hand.
He
shouted
a
command.
Cook
slaves
pulled
a
heavy
iron
stew
pot
from
the
firepit,
dumped
the
stew
onto
the
ground,
and
returned
the
pot
to
the
flames.
Drogo
tossed
in
the
belt
and
watched
without
expression
as
the
medallions
turned
red
and
began
to
lose
their
shape.
She
could
see
fires
dancing
in
the
onyx
of
his
eyes.
A
slave
handed
him
a
pair
of
thick
horsehair
mittens,
and
he
pulled
them
on,
never
so
much
as
looking
at
the
man.

Viserys
began
to
scream
the
high,
wordless
scream
of
the
coward
facing
death.
He
kicked
and
twisted,
whimpered
like
a
dog
and
wept
like
a
child,
but
the
Dothraki
held
him
tight
between
them.
Ser
Jorah
had
made
his
way
to
Dany’s
side.
He
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder.
“Turn
away,
my
princess,
I
beg
you.”

“No.”
She
folded
her
arms
across
the
swell
of
her
belly,
protectively.

At
the
last,
Viserys
looked
at
her.
“Sister,
please…
Dany,
tell
them…
make
them…
sweet
sister…”

When
the
gold
was
half-melted
and
starting
to
run,
Drogo
reached
into
the
flames,
snatched
out
the
pot.
“Crown!”
he
roared.
“Here.
A
crown
for
Cart
King!”
And
upended
the
pot
over
the
head
of
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother.

The
sound
Viserys
Targaryen
made
when
that
hideous
iron
helmet
covered
his
face
was
like
nothing
human.
His
feet
hammered
a
frantic
beat
against
the
dirt
floor,
slowed,
stopped.
Thick
globs
of
molten
gold
dripped
down
onto
his
chest,
setting
the
scarlet
silk
to
smoldering…
yet
no
drop
of
blood
was
spilled.

He
was
no
dragon,
Dany
thought,
curiously
calm.
Fire
cannot
kill
a
dragon.





EDDARD

He
was
walking
through
the
crypts
beneath
Winterfell,
as
he
he
had
walked
a
thousand
times
before.
The
Kings
of
Winter
watched
him
pass
with
eyes
of
ice,
and
the
direwolves
at
their
feet
turned
their
great
stone
heads
and
snarled.
Last
of
all,
he
came
to
the
tomb
where
his
father
slept,
with
Brandon
and
Lyanna
beside
him.
“Promise
me,
Ned,”
Lyanna’s
statue
whispered.
She
wore
a
garland
of
pale
blue
roses,
and
her
eyes
wept
blood.

Eddard
Stark
jerked
upright,
his
heart
racing,
the
blankets
tangled
around
him.
The
room
was
black
as
pitch,
and
someone
was
hammering
on
the
door.
“Lord
Eddard,”
a
voice
called
loudly.

“A
moment.”
Groggy
and
naked,
he
stumbled
his
way
across
the
darkened
chamber.
When
he
opened
the
door,
he
found
Tomard
with
an
upraised
fist,
and
Cayn
with
a
taper
in
hand.
Between
them
stood
the
king’s
own
steward.

The
man’s
face
might
have
been
carved
of
stone,
so
little
did
it
show.
“My
lord
Hand,”
he
intoned.
“His
Grace
the
King
commands
your
presence.
At
once.”

So
Robert
had
returned
from
his
hunt.
It
was
long
past
time.
“I
shall
need
a
few
moments
to
dress.”
Ned
left
the
man
waiting
without.
Cayn
helped
him
with
his
clothes;
white
linen
tunic
and
grey
cloak,
trousers
cut
open
down
his
plaster-sheathed
leg,
his
badge
of
office,
and
last
of
all
a
belt
of
heavy
silver
links.
He
sheathed
the
Valyrian
dagger
at
his
waist.

The
Red
Keep
was
dark
and
still
as
Cayn
and
Tomard
escorted
him
across
the
inner
bailey.
The
moon
hung
low
over
the
walls,
ripening
toward
full.
On
the
ramparts,
a
guardsman
in
a
gold
cloak
walked
his
rounds.

The
royal
apartments
were
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
a
massive
square
fortress
that
nestled
in
the
heart
of
the
Red
Keep
behind
walls
twelve
feet
thick
and
a
dry
moat
lined
with
iron
spikes,
a
castle-within-a-castle.
Ser
Boros
Blount
guarded
the
far
end
of
the
bridge,
white
steel
armor
ghostly
in
the
moonlight.
Within,
Ned
passed
two
other
knights
of
the
Kingsguard;
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps,
and
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
waited
at
the
door
of
the
king’s
bedchamber.
Three
men
in
white
cloaks,
he
thought,
remembering,
and
a
strange
chill
went
through
him.
Ser
Barristan’s
face
was
as
pale
as
his
armor.
Ned
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
know
that
something
was
dreadfully
wrong.
The
royal
steward
opened
the
door.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark,
the
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
announced.

“Bring
him
here,”
Robert’s
voice
called,
strangely
thick.

Fires
blazed
in
the
twin
hearths
at
either
end
of
the
bedchamber,
filling
the
room
with
a
sullen
red
glare.
The
heat
within
was
suffocating.
Robert
lay
across
the
canopied
bed.
At
the
bedside
hovered
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
while
Lord
Renly
paced
restlessly
before
the
shuttered
windows.
Servants
moved
back
and
forth,
feeding
logs
to
the
fire
and
boiling
wine.
Cersei
Lannister
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
beside
her
husband.
Her
hair
was
tousled,
as
if
from
sleep,
but
there
was
nothing
sleepy
in
her
eyes.
They
followed
Ned
as
Tomard
and
Cayn
helped
him
cross
the
room.
He
seemed
to
move
very
slowly,
as
if
he
were
still
dreaming.

The
king
still
wore
his
boots.
Ned
could
see
dried
mud
and
blades
of
grass
clinging
to
the
leather
where
Robert’s
feet
stuck
out
beneath
the
blanket
that
covered
him,
A
green
doublet
lay
on
the
floor,
slashed
open
and
discarded,
the
cloth
crusted
with
red-brown
stains.
The
room
smelled
of
smoke
and
blood
and
death.

“Ned,”
the
king
whispered
when
he
saw
him.
His
face
was
pale
as
milk.
“Come…
closer.”

His
men
brought
him
close.
Ned
steadied
himself
with
a
hand
on
the
bedpost.
He
had
only
to
look
down
at
Robert
to
know
how
bad
it
was.
“What…?”
he
began,
his
throat
clenched.

“A
boar.”
Lord
Renly
was
still
in
his
hunting
greens,
his
cloak
spattered
with
blood.

“A
devil,”
the
king
husked.
“My
own
fault.
Too
much
wine,
damn
me
to
hell.
Missed
my
thrust.”

“And
where
were
the
rest
of
you?”
Ned
demanded
of
Lord
Renly.
“Where
was
Ser
Barristan
and
the
Kingsguard?”

Renly’s
mouth
twitched.
“My
brother
commanded
us
to
stand
aside
and
let
him
take
the
boar
alone.”

Eddard
Stark
lifted
the
blanket.

They
had
done
what
they
could
to
close
him
up,
but
it
was
nowhere
near
enough.
The
boar
must
have
been
a
fearsome
thing.
It
had
ripped
the
king
from
groin
to
nipple
with
its
tusks.
The
wine-soaked
bandages
that
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
applied
were
already
black
with
blood,
and
the
smell
off
the
wound
was
hideous.
Ned’s
stomach
turned.
He
let
the
blanket
fall.

“Stinks,”
Robert
said.
“The
stink
of
death,
don’t
think
I
can’t
smell
it.
Bastard
did
me
good,
eh?
But
I…
I
paid
him
back
in
kind,
Ned.”
The
king’s
smile
was
as
terrible
as
his
wound,
his
teeth
red.
“Drove
a
knife
right
through
his
eye.
Ask
them
if
I
didn’t.
Ask
them.”

“Truly,”
Lord
Renly
murmured.
“We
brought
the
carcass
back
with
us,
at
my
brother’s
command.”

“For
the
feast,”
Robert
whispered.
“Now
leave
us.
The
lot
of
you.
I
need
to
speak
with
Ned.”

“Robert,
my
sweet
lord…”
Cersei
began.

“I
said
leave,”
Robert
insisted
with
a
hint
of
his
old
fierceness.
“What
part
of
that
don’t
you
understand,
woman?”

Cersei
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
her
dignity
and
led
the
way
to
the
door.
Lord
Renly
and
the
others
followed.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lingered,
his
hands
shaking
as
he
offered
the
king
a
cup
of
thick
white
liquid.
“The
milk
of
the
poppy,
Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“Drink.
For
your
pain.”

Robert
knocked
the
cup
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Away
with
you.
I’ll
sleep
soon
enough,
old
fool.
Get
out.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
gave
Ned
a
stricken
look
as
he
shuffled
from
the
room.

“Damn
you,
Robert,”
Ned
said
when
they
were
alone.
His
leg
was
throbbing
so
badly
he
was
almost
blind
with
pain.
Or
perhaps
it
was
grief
that
fogged
his
eyes.
He
lowered
himself
to
the
bed,
beside
his
friend.
“Why
do
you
always
have
to
be
so
headstrong?”

“Ah,
fuck
you,
Ned,”
the
king
said
hoarsely.
“I
killed
the
bastard,
didn’t
I?”
A
lock
of
matted
black
hair
fell
across
his
eyes
as
he
glared
up
at
Ned.
“Ought
to
do
the
same
for
you.
Can’t
leave
a
man
to
hunt
in
peace.
Ser
Robar
found
me.
Gregor’s
head.
Ugly
thought.
Never
told
the
Hound.
Let
Cersei
surprise
him.”
His
laugh
turned
into
a
grunt
as
a
spasm
of
pain
hit
him.
“Gods
have
mercy,”
he
muttered,
swallowing
his
agony.
“The
girl.
Daenerys.
Only
a
child,
you
were
right…
that’s
why,
the
girl…
the
gods
sent
the
boar…
sent
to
punish
me…”
The
king
coughed,
bringing
up
blood.
“Wrong,
it
was
wrong,
I…
only
a
girl…
Varys,
Littlefinger,
even
my
brother…
worthless…
no
one
to
tell
me
no
but
you,
Ned…
only
you…”
He
lifted
his
hand,
the
gesture
pained
and
feeble.
“Paper
and
ink.
There,
on
the
table.
Write
what
I
tell
you.”

Ned
smoothed
the
paper
out
across
his
knee
and
took
up
the
quill.
“At
your
command,
Your
Grace.”

“This
is
the
will
and
word
of
Robert
of
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
all
the
rest—put
in
the
damn
titles,
you
know
how
it
goes.
I
do
hereby
command
Eddard
of
House
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Hand
of
the
King,
to
serve
as
Lord
Regent
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
upon
my…
upon
my
death…
to
rule
in
my…
in
my
stead,
until
my
son
Joffrey
does
come
of
age…”

“Robert…”
Joffrey
is
not
your
son,
he
wanted
to
say,
but
the
words
would
not
come.
The
agony
was
written
too
plainly
across
Robert’s
face;
he
could
not
hurt
him
more.
So
Ned
bent
his
head
and
wrote,
but
where
the
king
had
said
“my
son
Joffrey,”
he
scrawled
“my
heir”
instead.
The
deceit
made
him
feel
soiled.
The
lies
we
tell
for
love,
he
thought.
May
the
gods
forgive
me.
“What
else
would
you
have
me
say?”

“Say…
whatever
you
need
to.
Protect
and
defend,
gods
old
and
new,
you
have
the
words.
Write.
I’ll
sign
it.
You
give
it
to
the
council
when
I’m
dead.”

“Robert,”
Ned
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
grief,
“you
must
not
do
this.
Don’t
die
on
me.
The
realm
needs
you.”

Robert
took
his
hand,
fingers
squeezing
hard.
“You
are…
such
a
bad
liar,
Ned
Stark,”
he
said
through
his
pain.
“The
realm…
the
realm
knows…
what
a
wretched
king
I’ve
been.
Bad
as
Aerys,
the
gods
spare
me.”

“No,”
Ned
told
his
dying
friend,
“not
so
bad
as
Aerys,
Your
Grace.
Not
near
so
bad
as
Aerys.”

Robert
managed
a
weak
red
smile.
“At
the
least,
they
will
say…
this
last
thing…
this
I
did
right.
You
won’t
fail
me.
You’ll
rule
now.
You’ll
hate
it,
worse
than
I
did…
but
you’ll
do
well.
Are
you
done
with
the
scribbling?”

“Yes,
Your
Grace.”
Ned
offered
Robert
the
paper.
The
king
scrawled
his
signature
blindly,
leaving
a
smear
of
blood
across
the
letter.
“The
seal
should
be
witnessed.”

“Serve
the
boar
at
my
funeral
feast,”
Robert
rasped.
“Apple
in
its
mouth,
skin
seared
crisp.
Eat
the
bastard.
Don’t
care
if
you
choke
on
him.
Promise
me,
Ned.”

“I
promise.”
Promise
me,
Ned,
Lyanna’s
voice
echoed.

“The
girl,”
the
king
said.
“Daenerys.
Let
her
live.
If
you
can,
if
it…
not
too
late…
talk
to
them…
Varys,
Littlefinger…
don’t
let
them
kill
her.
And
help
my
son,
Ned.
Make
him
be…
better
than
me.”
He
winced.
“Gods
have
mercy.”

“They
will,
my
friend,”
Ned
said.
“They
will.”

The
king
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
relax.
“Killed
by
a
pig,”
he
muttered.
“Ought
to
laugh,
but
it
hurts
too
much.”

Ned
was
not
laughing.
“Shall
I
call
them
back?”

Robert
gave
a
weak
nod.
“As
you
will.
Gods,
why
is
it
so
cold
in
here?”

The
servants
rushed
back
in
and
hurried
to
feed
the
fires.
The
queen
had
gone;
that
was
some
small
relief,
at
least.
If
she
had
any
sense,
Cersei
would
take
her
children
and
fly
before
the
break
of
day,
Ned
thought.
She
had
lingered
too
long
already.

King
Robert
did
not
seem
to
miss
her.
He
bid
his
brother
Renly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
stand
in
witness
as
he
pressed
his
seal
into
the
hot
yellow
wax
that
Ned
had
dripped
upon
his
letter.
“Now
give
me
something
for
the
pain
and
let
me
die.”

Hurriedly
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
mixed
him
another
draught
of
the
milk
of
the
poppy.
This
time
the
king
drank
deeply.
His
black
beard
was
beaded
with
thick
white
droplets
when
he
threw
the
empty
cup
aside.
“Will
I
dream?”

Ned
gave
him
his
answer.
“You
will,
my
lord.”

“Good,”
he
said,
smiling.
“I
will
give
Lyanna
your
love,
Ned.
Take
care
of
my
children
for
me.”

The
words
twisted
in
Ned’s
belly
like
a
knife.
For
a
moment
he
was
at
a
loss.
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
lie.
Then
he
remembered
the
bastards:
little
Barra
at
her
mother’s
breast,
Mya
in
the
Vale,
Gendry
at
his
forge,
and
all
the
others.
“I
shall…
guard
your
children
as
if
they
were
my
own,”
he
said
slowly.

Robert
nodded
and
closed
his
eyes.
Ned
watched
his
old
friend
sag
softly
into
the
pillows
as
the
milk
of
the
poppy
washed
the
pain
from
his
face.
Sleep
took
him.

Heavy
chains
jangled
softly
as
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
up
to
Ned.
“I
will
do
all
in
my
power,
my
lord,
but
the
wound
has
mortified.
It
took
them
two
days
to
get
him
back.
By
the
time
I
saw
him,
it
was
too
late.
I
can
lessen
His
Grace’s
suffering,
but
only
the
gods
can
heal
him
now.”

“How
long?”
Ned
asked.

“By
rights,
he
should
be
dead
already.
I
have
never
seen
a
man
cling
to
life
so
fiercely.”

“My
brother
was
always
strong,”
Lord
Renly
said.
“Not
wise,
perhaps,
but
strong.”
In
the
sweltering
heat
of
the
bedchamber,
his
brow
was
slick
with
sweat.
He
might
have
been
Robert’s
ghost
as
he
stood
there,
young
and
dark
and
handsome.
“He
slew
the
boar.
His
entrails
were
sliding
from
his
belly,
yet
somehow
he
slew
the
boar.”
His
voice
was
full
of
wonder.

“Robert
was
never
a
man
to
leave
the
battleground
so
long
as
a
foe
remained
standing,”
Ned
told
him.

Outside
the
door,
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
still
guarded
the
tower
stairs.
“Maester
Pycelle
has
given
Robert
the
milk
of
the
poppy,”
Ned
told
him.
“See
that
no
one
disturbs
his
rest
without
leave
from
me.”

“It
shall
be
as
you
command,
my
lord.”
Ser
Barristan
seemed
old
beyond
his
years.
“I
have
failed
my
sacred
trust.”

“Even
the
truest
knight
cannot
protect
a
king
against
himself,”
Ned
said.
“Robert
loved
to
hunt
boar.
I
have
seen
him
take
a
thousand
of
them.”
He
would
stand
his
ground
without
flinching,
his
legs
braced,
the
great
spear
in
his
hands,
and
as
often
as
not
he
would
curse
the
boar
as
it
charged,
and
wait
until
the
last
possible
second,
until
it
was
almost
on
him,
before
he
killed
it
with
a
single
sure
and
savage
thrust.
“No
one
could
know
this
one
would
be
his
death.”

“You
are
kind
to
say
so,
Lord
Eddard.”

“The
king
himself
said
as
much.
He
blamed
the
wine.”

The
white-haired
knight
gave
a
weary
nod.
“His
Grace
was
reeling
in
his
saddle
by
the
time
we
flushed
the
boar
from
his
lair,
yet
he
commanded
us
all
to
stand
aside.”

“I
wonder,
Ser
Barristan,”
asked
Varys,
so
quietly,
“who
gave
the
king
this
wine?”

Ned
had
not
heard
the
eunuch
approach,
but
when
he
looked
around,
there
he
stood.
He
wore
a
black
velvet
robe
that
brushed
the
floor,
and
his
face
was
freshly
powdered.

“The
wine
was
from
the
king’s
own
skin,”
Ser
Barristan
said.

“Only
one
skin?
Hunting
is
such
thirsty
work.”

“I
did
not
keep
count.
More
than
one,
for
a
certainty.
His
squire
would
fetch
him
a
fresh
skin
whenever
he
required
it.”

“Such
a
dutiful
boy,”
said
Varys,
“to
make
certain
His
Grace
did
not
lack
for
refreshment.”

Ned
had
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth.
He
recalled
the
two
fair-haired
boys
Robert
had
sent
chasing
after
a
breastplate
stretcher.
The
king
had
told
everyone
the
tale
that
night
at
the
feast,
laughing
until
he
shook.
“Which
squire?”

“The
elder,”
said
Ser
Barristan.
“Lancel.”

“I
know
the
lad
well,”
said
Varys.
“A
stalwart
boy,
Ser
Kevan
Lannister’s
son,
nephew
to
Lord
Tywin
and
cousin
to
the
queen.
I
hope
the
dear
sweet
lad
does
not
blame
himself.
Children
are
so
vulnerable
in
the
innocence
of
their
youth,
how
well
do
I
remember.”

Certainly
Varys
had
once
been
young.
Ned
doubted
that
he
had
ever
been
innocent.
“You
mention
children.
Robert
had
a
change
of
heart
concerning
Daenerys
Targaryen.
Whatever
arrangements
you
made,
I
want
unmade.
At
once.”

“Alas,”
said
Varys.
“At
once
may
be
too
late.
I
fear
those
birds
have
flown.
But
I
shall
do
what
I
can,
my
lord.
With
your
leave.”
He
bowed
and
vanished
down
the
steps,
his
soft-soled
slippers
whispering
against
the
stone
as
he
made
his
descent.

Cayn
and
Tomard
were
helping
Ned
across
the
bridge
when
Lord
Renly
emerged
from
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
“Lord
Eddard,”
he
called
after
Ned,
“a
moment,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

Ned
stopped.
“As
you
wish.”

Renly
walked
to
his
side.
“Send
your
men
away.”
They
met
in
the
center
of
the
bridge,
the
dry
moat
beneath
them.
Moonlight
silvered
the
cruel
edges
of
the
spikes
that
lined
its
bed.

Ned
gestured.
Tomard
and
Cayn
bowed
their
heads
and
backed
away
respectfully.
Lord
Renly
glanced
warily
at
Ser
Boros
on
the
far
end
of
the
span,
at
Ser
Preston
in
the
doorway
behind
them.
“That
letter.”
He
leaned
close.
“Was
it
the
regency?
Has
my
brother
named
you
Protector?”
He
did
not
wait
for
a
reply.
“My
lord,
I
have
thirty
men
in
my
personal
guard,
and
other
friends
beside,
knights
and
lords.
Give
me
an
hour,
and
I
can
put
a
hundred
swords
in
your
hand.”

“And
what
should
I
do
with
a
hundred
swords,
my
lord?”

“Strike!
Now,
while
the
castle
sleeps.”
Renly
looked
back
at
Ser
Boros
again
and
dropped
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper.
“We
must
get
Joffrey
away
from
his
mother
and
take
him
in
hand.
Protector
or
no,
the
man
who
holds
the
king
holds
the
kingdom.
We
should
seize
Myrcella
and
Tommen
as
well.
Once
we
have
her
children,
Cersei
will
not
dare
oppose
us.
The
council
will
confirm
you
as
Lord
Protector
and
make
Joffrey
your
ward.”

Ned
regarded
him
coldly.
“Robert
is
not
dead
yet.
The
gods
may
spare
him.
If
not,
I
shall
convene
the
council
to
hear
his
final
words
and
consider
the
matter
of
the
succession,
but
I
will
not
dishonor
his
last
hours
on
earth
by
shedding
blood
in
his
halls
and
dragging
frightened
children
from
their
beds.”

Lord
Renly
took
a
step
back,
taut
as
a
bowstring.
“Every
moment
you
delay
gives
Cersei
another
moment
to
prepare.
By
the
time
Robert
dies,
it
may
be
too
late…
for
both
of
us.”

“Then
we
should
pray
that
Robert
does
not
die.”

“Small
chance
of
that,”
said
Renly.

“Sometimes
the
gods
are
merciful.”

“The
Lannisters
are
not.”
Lord
Renly
turned
away
and
went
back
across
the
moat,
to
the
tower
where
his
brother
lay
dying.

By
the
time
Ned
returned
to
his
chambers,
he
felt
weary
and
heartsick,
yet
there
was
no
question
of
his
going
back
to
sleep,
not
now.
When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die,
Cersei
Lannister
had
told
him
in
the
godswood.
He
found
himself
wondering
if
he
had
done
the
right
thing
by
refusing
Lord
Renly’s
offer.
He
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues,
and
there
was
no
honor
in
threatening
children,
and
yet…
if
Cersei
elected
to
fight
rather
than
flee,
he
might
well
have
need
of
Renly’s
hundred
swords,
and
more
besides.

“I
want
Littlefinger,”
he
told
Cayn.
“If
he’s
not
in
his
chambers,
take
as
many
men
as
you
need
and
search
every
winesink
and
whorehouse
in
King’s
Landing
until
you
find
him.
Bring
him
to
me
before
break
of
day.”
Cayn
bowed
and
took
his
leave,
and
Ned
turned
to
Tomard.
“The
Wind
Witch
sails
on
the
evening
tide.
Have
you
chosen
the
escort?”

“Ten
men,
with
Porther
in
command.”

“Twenty,
and
you
will
command,”
Ned
said.
Porther
was
a
brave
man,
but
headstrong.
He
wanted
someone
more
solid
and
sensible
to
keep
watch
over
his
daughters.

“As
you
wish,
m’lord,”
Tom
said.
“Can’t
say
I’ll
be
sad
to
see
the
back
of
this
place.
I
miss
the
wife.”

“You
will
pass
near
Dragonstone
when
you
turn
north.
I
need
you
to
deliver
a
letter
for
me.”

Tom
looked
apprehensive.
“To
Dragonstone,
m’lord?”
The
island
fortress
of
House
Targaryen
had
a
sinister
repute.

“Tell
Captain
Qos
to
hoist
my
banner
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
sight
of
the
island.
They
may
be
wary
of
unexpected
visitors.
If
he
is
reluctant,
offer
him
whatever
it
takes.
I
will
give
you
a
letter
to
place
into
the
hand
of
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon.
No
one
else.
Not
his
steward,
nor
the
captain
of
his
guard,
nor
his
lady
wife,
but
only
Lord
Stannis
himself.”
>>>>>>> asd

“As
you
command,
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
my
lady.”

Not
long
after,
a
rider
with
the
Mallister
eagle
sewn
on
his
breast
arrived
with
a
message
from
Lord
Jason,
telling
of
another
skirmish
and
another
victory.
Ser
Flement
Brax
had
tried
to
force
a
crossing
at
a
different
ford
six
leagues
to
the
south.
This
time
the
Lannisters
shortened
their
lances
and
advanced
across
the
river
behind
on
foot,
but
the
Mallister
bowmen
had
rained
high
arcing
shots
down
over
their
shields,
while
the
scorpions
Edmure
had
mounted
on
the
riverbank
sent
heavy
stones
crashing
through
to
break
up
the
formation.
“They
left
a
dozen
dead
in
the
water,
only
two
reaching
the
shallows,
where
we
dealt
with
them
briskly,”
the
rider
reported.
He
also
told
of
fighting
farther
upstream,
where
Lord
Karyl
Vance
held
the
fords.
“Those
thrusts
too
were
turned
aside,
at
grievous
cost
to
our
foes.”

Perhaps
Edmure
was
wiser
than
I
knew,
Catelyn
thought.
His
lords
all
saw
the
sense
in
his
battle
plans,
why
was
I
so
blind?
My
brother
is
not
the
little
boy
I
remember,
no
more
than
Robb
is.

She
waited
until
evening
before
going
to
pay
her
call
upon
Ser
Cleos
Frey,
reasoning
that
the
longer
she
delayed,
the
drunker
he
was
likely
to
be.
As
she
entered
the
tower
cell,
Ser
Cleos
stumbled
to
his
knees.
“My
lady,
I
knew
naught
of
any
escape.
The
Imp
said
a
Lannister
must
needs
have
a
Lannister
escort,
on
my
oath
as
a
knight—”

“Arise,
ser.”
Catelyn
seated
herself.
“I
know
no
grandson
of
Walder
Frey
would
be
an
oathbreaker.”
Unless
it
served
his
purpose.
“You
brought
peace
terms,
my
brother
said.”

“I
did.”
Ser
Cleos
lurched
to
his
feet.
She
was
pleased
to
see
how
unsteady
he
was.

“Tell
me,”
she
commanded,
and
he
did.

=======
m’lord.”

When
Tomard
had
left
him,
Lord
Eddard
Stark
sat
staring
at
the
flame
of
the
candle
that
burned
beside
him
on
the
table.
For
a
moment
his
grief
overwhelmed
him.
He
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
seek
out
the
godswood,
to
kneel
before
the
heart
tree
and
pray
for
the
life
of
Robert
Baratheon,
who
had
been
more
than
a
brother
to
him.
Men
would
whisper
afterward
that
Eddard
Stark
had
betrayed
his
king’s
friendship
and
disinherited
his
sons;
he
could
only
hope
that
the
gods
would
know
better,
and
that
Robert
would
learn
the
truth
of
it
in
the
land
beyond
the
grave.

Ned
took
out
the
king’s
last
letter.
A
roll
of
crisp
white
parchment
sealed
with
golden
wax,
a
few
short
words
and
a
smear
of
blood.
How
small
the
difference
between
victory
and
defeat,
between
life
and
death.

He
drew
out
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
and
dipped
his
quill
in
the
inkpot.
To
His
Grace,
Stannis
of
the
House
Baratheon,
he
wrote.
By
the
time
you
receive
this
letter,
your
brother
Robert,
our
King
these
past
fifteen
years,
will
be
dead.
He
was
savaged
by
a
boar
whilst
hunting
in
the
kingswood…

The
letters
seemed
to
writhe
and
twist
on
the
paper
as
his
hand
trailed
to
a
stop.
Lord
Tywin
and
Ser
Jaime
were
not
men
to
suffer
disgrace
meekly;
they
would
fight
rather
than
flee.
No
doubt
Lord
Stannis
was
wary,
after
the
murder
of
Jon
Arryn,
but
it
was
imperative
that
he
sail
for
King’s
Landing
at
once
with
all
his
power,
before
the
Lannisters
could
march.

Ned
chose
each
word
with
care.
>>>>>>> asd
When
he
was
done,
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
Catelyn
sat
frowning.
Edmure
had
been
right,
these
were
no
terms
at
all,
except…“Lannister
will
exchange
Arya
and
Sansa
for
his
brother?”

“Yes.
He
sat
on
the
Iron
Throne
and
swore
it.”

“Before
witnesses?”

“Before
all
the
court,
my
lady.
And
the
gods
as
well.
I
said
as
much
to
Ser
Edmure,
but
he
told
me
it
was
not
possible,
that
His
Grace
Robb
would
never
consent.”

“He
told
you
true.”
She
could
not
even
say
that
Robb
was
wrong.
Arya
and
Sansa
were
children.
The
Kingslayer,
alive
and
free,
was
as
dangerous
as
any
man
in
the
realm.
That
road
led
nowhere.
“Did
you
see
my
girls?
Are
they
treated
well?”

Ser
Cleos
hesitated.
“I…
yes,
they
seemed…”

He
is
fumbling
for
a
lie,
Catelyn
realized,
but
the
wine
has
fuddled
his
wits.
“Ser
Cleos,”
she
said
coolly,
“you
forfeited
the
protection
of
your
peace
banner
when
your
men
played
us
false.
Lie
to
me,
and
you’ll
hang
from
the
walls
beside
them.
Believe
that.
I
shall
ask
you
once
more—did
you
see
my
daughters?”

His
brow
was
damp
with
sweat.
“I
saw
Sansa
at
the
court,
the
day
Tyrion
told
me
his
terms.
She
looked
most
beautiful,
my
lady.
Perhaps
a,
a
bit
wan.
Drawn,
as
it
were.”

Sansa,
but
not
Arya.
That
might
mean
anything.
Arya
had
always
been
harder
to
tame.
Perhaps
Cersei
was
reluctant
to
parade
her
in
open
court
for
fear
of
what
she
might
say
or
do.
They
might
have
her
locked
safely
out
of
sight.
Or
they
might
have
killed
her.
Catelyn
shoved
the
thought
away.
“His
terms,
you
said…
yet
Cersei
is
Queen
Regent.”

“Tyrion
spoke
for
both
of
them.
The
queen
was
not
there.
She
was
indisposed
that
day,
I
was
told.”

“Curious.”
Catelyn
thought
back
to
that
terrible
trek
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
and
the
way
Tyrion
Lannister
had
somehow
seduced
that
sellsword
from
her
service
to
his
own.
The
dwarf
is
too
clever
by
half.
She
could
not
imagine
how
he
had
survived
the
high
road
after
Lysa
had
sent
him
from
the
Vale,
yet
it
did
not
surprise
her.
He
had
no
part
in
Ned’s
murder,
at
the
least.
And
he
came
to
my
defense
when
the
clansmen
attacked
us.
If
I
could
trust
his
word…

She
opened
her
hands
to
look
down
at
the
scars
across
her
fingers.
His
dagger’s
marks,
she
reminded
herself.
His
dagger,
in
the
hand
of
the
killer
he
paid
to
open
Bran’s
throat.
Though
the
dwarf
denied
it,
to
be
sure.
Even
after
Lysa
locked
him
in
one
of
her
sky
cells
and
threatened
him
with
her
moon
door,
he
had
still
denied
it.
“He
lied,”
she
said,
rising
abruptly.
“The
Lannisters
are
liars
every
one,
and
the
dwarf
is
the
worst
of
them.
The
killer
was
armed
with
his
own
knife.”

Ser
Cleos
stared.
“I
know
nothing
of
any—”

“You
know
nothing,”
she
agreed,
sweeping
from
the
cell.
Brienne
fell
in
beside
her,
silent.
It
is
simpler
for
her,
Catelyn
thought
with
a
pang
of
envy.
She
was
like
a
man
in
that.
For
men
the
answer
was
always
the
same,
and
never
farther
away
than
the
nearest
sword.
For
a
woman,
a
mother,
the
way
was
stonier
and
harder
to
know.

She
took
a
late
supper
in
the
Great
Hall
with
her
garrison,
to
give
them
what
encouragement
she
could.
Rymund
the
Rhymer
sang
through
all
the
courses,
sparing
her
the
need
to
talk.
He
closed
with
the
song
he
had
written
about
Robb’s
victory
at
Oxcross.
“And
the
stars
in
the
night
were
the
eyes
of
his
wolves,
and
the
wind
itself
was
their
song.”
Between
the
verses,
Rymund
threw
back
his
head
and
howled,
and
by
the
end,
half
of
the
hall
was
howling
along
with
him,
even
Desmond
Grell,
who
was
well
in
his
cups.
Their
voices
rang
off
the
rafters.

Let
them
have
their
songs,
if
it
makes
them
brave,
Catelyn
thought,
toying
with
her
silver
goblet.

“There
was
always
a
singer
at
Evenfall
Hall
when
I
was
a
girl,”
Brienne
said
quietly.
“I
learned
all
the
songs
by
heart.”

“Sansa
did
the
same,
though
few
singers
ever
cared
to
make
the
long
journey
north
to
Winterfell.”
I
told
her
there
would
be
singers
at
the
king’s
court,
though.
I
told
her
she
would
hear
music
of
all
sorts,
that
her
father
could
find
some
master
to
help
her
learn
the
high
harp.
Oh,
gods
forgive
me…

Brienne
said,
“I
remember
a
woman…
she
came
from
some
place
across
the
narrow
sea.
I
could
not
even
say
what
language
she
sang
in,
but
her
voice
was
as
lovely
as
she
was.
She
had
eyes
the
color
of
plums
and
her
waist
was
so
tiny
my
father
could
put
his
hands
around
it.
His
hands
were
almost
as
big
as
mine.”
She
closed
her
long,
thick
fingers,
as
if
to
hide
them.

“Did
you
sing
for
your
father?”
Catelyn
asked.

Brienne
shook
her
head,
staring
down
at
her
trencher
as
if
to
find
some
answer
in
the
gravy.

“For
Lord
Renly?”

The
girl
reddened.
“Never,
I…
his
fool,
he
made
cruel
japes
sometimes,
and
I…”

“Someday
you
must
sing
for
me.”

“I…
please,
I
have
no
gift.”
Brienne
pushed
back
from
the
table.
“Forgive
me,
my
lady.
Do
I
have
your
leave
to
go?”

Catelyn
nodded.
The
tall,
ungainly
girl
left
the
hall
with
long
strides,
almost
unnoticed
amidst
the
revelry.
May
the
gods
go
with
her,
she
thought
as
she
returned
listlessly
to
her
supper.

It
was
three
days
later
when
the
hammer
blow
that
Brienne
had
foretold
fell,
and
five
days
before
they
heard
of
it.
Catelyn
was
sitting
with
her
father
when
Edmure’s
messenger
arrived.
The
man’s
armor
was
dinted,
his
boots
dusty,
and
he
had
a
ragged
hole
in
his
surcoat,
but
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
knelt
was
enough
to
tell
her
that
the
news
was
good.
“Victory,
my
lady.”
He
handed
her
Edmure’s
letter.
Her
hand
trembled
as
she
broke
the
seal.

Lord
Tywin
had
tried
to
force
a
crossing
at
a
dozen
different
fords,
her
brother
wrote,
but
every
thrust
had
been
thrown
back.
Lord
Lefford
had
been
drowned,
the
Crakehall
knight
called
Strongboar
taken
captive,
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
thrice
forced
to
retreat…
but
the
fiercest
battle
had
been
fought
at
Stone
Mill,
where
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
had
led
the
assault.
So
many
of
his
men
had
fallen
that
their
dead
horses
threatened
to
dam
the
flow.
In
the
end
the
Mountain
and
a
handful
of
his
best
had
gained
the
west
bank,
but
Edmure
had
thrown
his
reserve
at
them,
and
they
had
shattered
and
reeled
away
bloody
and
beaten.
Ser
Gregor
himself
had
lost
his
horse
and
staggered
back
across
the
Red
Fork
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds
while
a
rain
of
arrows
and
stones
fell
all
around
him.
“They
shall
not
cross,
Cat,”
Edmure
scrawled,
“Lord
Tywin
is
marching
to
the
southeast.
A
feint
perhaps,
or
full
retreat,
it
matters
not.
They
shall
not
cross.”

Ser
Desmond
Grell
had
been
elated.
“Oh,
if
only
I
might
have
been
with
him,”
the
old
knight
said
when
she
read
him
the
letter.
“Where
is
that
fool
Rymund?
There’s
a
song
in
this,
by
the
gods,
and
one
that
even
Edmure
will
want
to
hear.
The
mill
that
ground
the
Mountain
down,
I
could
almost
make
the
words
myself,
had
I
the
singer’s
gift.”

“I’ll
hear
no
songs
until
the
fighting’s
done,”
Catelyn
said,
perhaps
too
sharply.
Yet
she
allowed
Ser
Desmond
to
spread
the
word,
and
agreed
when
he
suggested
breaking
open
some
casks
in
honor
of
Stone
Mill.
The
mood
within
Riverrun
had
been
strained
and
somber;
they
would
all
be
better
for
a
little
drink
and
hope.

That
night
the
castle
rang
to
the
sounds
of
celebration.
“Riverrun!”
the
smallfolk
shouted,
and
“Tully!
Tully!”
They’d
come
frightened
and
helpless,
and
her
brother
had
taken
them
in
when
most
lords
would
have
closed
their
gates.
Their
voices
floated
in
through
the
high
windows,
and
seeped
under
the
heavy
redwood
doors.
Rymund
played
his
harp,
accompanied
by
a
pair
of
drummers
and
a
youth
with
a
set
of
reed
pipes.
Catelyn
listened
to
girlish
laughter,
and
the
excited
chatter
of
the
green
boys
her
brother
had
left
her
for
a
garrison.
Good
sounds…
and
yet
they
did
not
touch
her.
She
could
not
share
their
happiness.

In
her
father’s
solar
she
found
a
heavy
leatherbound
book
of
maps
and
opened
it
to
the
riverlands.
Her
eyes
found
the
path
of
the
Red
Fork
and
traced
it
by
flickering
candlelight.
Marching
to
the
southeast,
she
thought.
By
now
they
had
likely
reached
the
headwaters
of
the
Blackwater
Rush,
she
decided.

She
closed
the
book
even
more
uneasy
than
before.
The
gods
had
granted
them
victory
after
victory.
At
Stone
Mill,
at
Oxcross,
in
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
at
the
Whispering
Wood…

But
if
we
are
winning,
why
am
I
so
afraid?





BRAN

The
sound
was
the
faintest
of
clinks,
a
scraping
of
steel
over
stone.
He
lifted
his
head
from
his
paws,
listening,
sniffing
at
the
night.

The
evening’s
rain
had
woken
a
hundred
sleeping
smells
and
made
them
ripe
and
strong
again.
Grass
and
thorns,
blackberries
broken
on
the
ground,
mud,
worms,
rotting
leaves,
a
rat
creeping
through
the
bush.
He
caught
the
shaggy
black
scent
of
his
brother’s
coat
and
the
sharp
coppery
tang
of
blood
from
the
squirrel
he’d
killed.
Other
squirrels
moved
through
the
branches
above,
smelling
of
wet
fur
and
fear,
their
little
claws
scratching
at
the
bark.
The
noise
had
sounded
something
like
that.

And
he
heard
it
again,
clink
and
scrape.
It
brought
him
to
his
feet.
His
ears
pricked
and
his
tail
rose.
He
howled,
a
long
deep
shivery
cry,
a
howl
to
wake
the
sleepers,
but
the
piles
of
man-rock
were
dark
and
dead.
A
still
wet
night,
a
night
to
drive
men
into
their
holes.
The
rain
had
stopped,
but
the
men
still
hid
from
the
damp,
huddled
by
the
fires
in
their
caves
of
piled
stone.

His
brother
came
sliding
through
the
trees,
moving
almost
as
quiet
as
another
brother
he
remembered
dimly
from
long
ago,
the
white
one
with
the
eyes
of
blood.
This
brother’s
eyes
were
pools
of
shadow,
but
the
fur
on
the
back
of
his
neck
was
bristling.
He
had
heard
the
sounds
as
well,
and
known
they
meant
danger.

This
time
the
clink
and
scrape
were
followed
by
a
slithering
and
the
soft
swift
patter
of
skinfeet
on
stone.
The
wind
brought
the
faintest
whiff
of
a
man-smell
he
did
not
know.
Stranger.
Danger.
Death.

He
ran
toward
the
sound,
his
brother
racing
beside
him.
The
stone
dens
rose
before
them,
walls
slick
and
wet.
He
bared
his
teeth,
but
the
man-rock
took
no
notice.
A
gate
loomed
up,
a
black
iron
snake
coiled
tight
about
bar
and
post.
When
he
crashed
against
it,
the
gate
shuddered
and
the
snake
clanked
and
slithered
and
held.
Through
the
bars
he
could
look
down
the
long
stone
burrow
that
ran
between
the
walls
to
the
stony
field
beyond,
but
there
was
no
way
through.
He
could
force
his
muzzle
between
the
bars,
but
no
more.
Many
a
time
his
brother
had
tried
to
crack
the
black
bones
of
the
gate
between
his
teeth,
but
they
would
not
break.
They
had
tried
to
dig
under,
but
there
were
great
flat
stones
beneath,
half-covered
by
earth
and
blown
leaves.

Snarling,
he
paced
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
gate,
then
threw
himself
at
it
once
more.
It
moved
a
little
and
slammed
him
back.
Locked,
something
whispered.
Chained.
The
voice
he
did
not
hear,
the
scent
without
a
smell.
The
other
ways
were
closed
as
well.
Where
doors
opened
in
the
walls
of
man-rock,
the
wood
was
thick
and
strong.
There
was
no
way
out.

There
is,
the
whisper
came,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
see
the
shadow
of
a
great
tree
covered
in
needles,
slanting
up
out
of
the
black
earth
to
ten
times
the
height
of
a
man.
Yet
when
he
looked
about,
it
was
not
there.
The
other
side
of
the
godswood,
the
sentinel,
hurry,
hurry…

Through
the
gloom
of
night
came
a
muffled
shout,
cut
short.

Swiftly,
swiftly,
he
whirled
and
bounded
back
into
the
trees,
wet
leaves
rustling
beneath
his
paws,
branches
whipping
at
him
as
he
rushed
past.
He
could
hear
his
brother
following
close.
They
plunged
under
the
heart
tree
and
around
the
cold
pool,
through
the
blackberry
bushes,
under
a
tangle
of
oaks
and
ash
and
hawthorn
scrub,
to
the
far
side
of
the
wood…
and
there
it
was,
the
shadow
he’d
glimpsed
without
seeing,
the
slanting
tree
pointing
at
the
rooftops.
Sentinel,
came
the
thought.

He
remembered
how
it
was
to
climb
it
then.
The
needles
everywhere,
scratching
at
his
bare
face
and
falling
down
the
back
of
his
neck,
the
sticky
sap
on
his
hands,
the
sharp
piney
smell
of
it.
It
was
an
easy
tree
for
a
boy
to
climb,
leaning
as
it
did,
crooked,
the
branches
so
close
together
they
almost
made
a
ladder,
slanting
right
up
to
the
roof.

Growling,
he
sniffed
around
the
base
of
the
tree,
lifted
a
leg
and
marked
it
with
a
stream
of
urine.
A
low
branch
brushed
his
face,
and
he
snapped
at
it,
twisting
and
pulling
until
the
wood
cracked
and
tore.
His
mouth
was
full
of
needles
and
the
bitter
taste
of
the
sap.
He
shook
his
head
and
snarled.

His
brother
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
lifted
his
voice
in
a
ululating
howl,
his
song
black
with
mourning.
The
way
was
no
way.
They
were
not
squirrels,
nor
the
cubs
of
men,
they
could
not
wriggle
up
the
trunks
of
trees,
clinging
with
soft
pink
paws
and
clumsy
feet.
They
were
runners,
hunters,
prowlers.

Off
across
the
night,
beyond
the
stone
that
hemmed
them
close,
the
dogs
woke
and
began
to
bark.
One
and
then
another
and
then
all
of
them,
a
great
clamor.
They
smelled
it
too;
the
scent
of
foes
and
fear.

A
desperate
fury
filled
him,
hot
as
hunger.
He
sprang
away
from
the
wall
loped
off
beneath
the
trees,
the
shadows
of
branch
and
leaf
dappling
his
grey
fur…
and
then
he
turned
and
raced
back
in
a
rush.
His
feet
flew
kicking
up
wet
leaves
and
pine
needles,
and
for
a
little
time
he
was
a
hunter
and
an
antlered
stag
was
fleeing
before
him
and
he
could
see
it,
smell
it,
and
he
ran
full
out
in
pursuit.
The
smell
of
fear
made
his
heart
thunder
and
slaver
ran
from
his
jaws,
and
he
reached
the
falling
tree
in
stride
and
threw
himself
up
the
trunk,
claws
scrabbling
at
the
bark
for
purchase.
Upward
he
bounded,
up,
two
bounds,
three,
hardly
slowing,
until
he
was
among
the
lower
limbs.
Branches
tangled
his
feet
and
whipped
at
his
eyes,
grey-green
needles
scattered
as
he
shouldered
through
them,
snapping.
He
had
to
slow.
Something
snagged
at
his
foot
and
he
wrenched
it
free,
snarling.
The
trunk
narrowed
under
him,
the
slope
steeper,
almost
straight
up,
and
wet.
The
bark
tore
like
skin
when
he
tried
to
claw
at
it.
He
was
a
third
of
the
way
up,
halfway,
more,
the
roof
was
almost
within
reach…
and
then
he
put
down
a
foot
and
felt
it
slip
off
the
curve
of
wet
wood,
and
suddenly
he
was
sliding,
stumbling.
He
yowled
in
fear
and
fury,
falling,
falling,
and
twisted
around
while
the
ground
rushed
up
to
break
him…

And
then
Bran
was
back
abed
in
his
lonely
tower
room,
tangled
in
his
blankets,
his
breath
coming
hard.
“Summer,”
he
cried
aloud.
“Summer.”
His
shoulder
seemed
to
ache,
as
if
he
had
fallen
on
it,
but
he
knew
it
was
only
the
ghost
of
what
the
wolf
was
feeling.
Jojen
told
it
true.
I
am
a
beastling.
Outside
he
could
hear
the
faint
barking
of
dogs.
The
sea
has
come.
It’s
flowing
over
the
walls,
just
as
Jojen
saw.
Bran
grabbed
the
bar
overhead
and
pulled
himself
up,
shouting
for
help.
No
one
came,
and
after
a
moment
he
remembered
that
no
one
would.
They
had
taken
the
guard
off
his
door.
Ser
Rodrik
had
needed
every
man
of
fighting
age
he
could
lay
his
hands
on,
so
Winterfell
had
been
left
with
only
a
token
garrison.

The
rest
had
left
eight
days
past,
six
hundred
men
from
Winterfell
and
the
nearest
holdfasts.
Cley
Cerwyn
was
bringing
three
hundred
more
to
join
them
on
the
march,
and
Maester
Luwin
had
sent
ravens
before
them,
summoning
levies
from
White
Harbor
and
the
barrowlands
and
even
the
deep
places
inside
the
wolfswood.
Torrhen’s
Square
was
under
attack
by
some
monstrous
war
chief
named
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.
Old
Nan
said
he
couldn’t
be
killed,
that
once
a
foe
had
cut
his
head
in
two
with
an
axe,
but
Dagmer
was
so
fierce
he’d
just
pushed
the
two
halves
back
together
and
held
them
until
they
healed
up.
Could
Dagmer
have
won?
Torrhen’s
Square
was
many
days
from
Winterfell,
yet
still…

Bran
pulled
himself
from
the
bed,
moving
bar
to
bar
until
he
reached
the
windows.
His
fingers
fumbled
a
little
as
he
swung
back
the
shutters.
The
yard
was
empty,
and
all
the
windows
he
could
see
were
black.
Winterfell
slept.
“Hodor!”
he
shouted
down,
as
loud
as
he
could.
Hodor
would
be
asleep
above
the
stables,
but
maybe
if
he
yelled
loud
enough
he’d
hear,
or
somebody
would.
“Hodor,
come
fast!
Osha!
Meera,
Jojen,
anyone!”
Bran
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth.
“HOOOOODOOOOOR!”

But
when
the
door
crashed
open
behind
him,
the
man
who
stepped
through
was
no
one
Bran
knew.
He
wore
a
leather
jerkin
sewn
with
overlapping
iron
disks,
and
carried
a
dirk
in
one
hand
and
an
axe
strapped
to
his
back.
“What
do
you
want?”
Bran
demanded,
afraid.
“This
is
my
room.
You
get
out
of
here.”

Theon
Greyjoy
followed
him
into
the
bedchamber.
“We’re
not
here
to
harm
you,
Bran.”

“Theon?”
Bran
felt
dizzy
with
relief.
“Did
Robb
send
you?
Is
he
here
too?”

“Robb’s
far
away.
He
can’t
help
you
now.”

“Help
me?”
He
was
confused.
“Don’t
scare
me,
Theon.”

“I’m
Prince
Theon
now.
We’re
both
princes,
Bran.
Who
would
have
dreamed
it?
But
I’ve
taken
your
castle,
my
prince.”

“Winterfell?”
Bran
shook
his
head.
“No,
you
couldn’t.”

“Leave
us,
Werlag.”
The
man
with
the
dirk
withdrew.
Theon
seated
himself
on
the
bed.
“I
sent
four
men
over
the
walls
with
grappling
claws
and
ropes,
and
they
opened
a
postern
gate
for
the
rest
of
us.
My
men
are
dealing
with
yours
even
now.
I
promise
you,
Winterfell
is
mine.”

Bran
did
not
understand.
“But
you’re
Father’s
ward.”

“And
now
you
and
your
brother
are
my
wards.
As
soon
as
the
fighting’s
done,
my
men
will
be
bringing
the
rest
of
your
people
together
in
the
Great
Hall.
You
and
I
are
going
to
speak
to
them.
You’ll
tell
them
how
you’ve
yielded
Winterfell
to
me,
and
command
them
to
serve
and
obey
their
new
lord
as
they
did
the
old.”

“I
won’t,”
said
Bran.
“We’ll
fight
you
and
throw
you
out.
I
never
yielded,
you
can’t
make
me
say
I
did.”

“This
is
no
game,
Bran,
so
don’t
play
the
boy
with
me,
I
won’t
stand
for
it.
The
castle
is
mine,
but
these
people
are
still
yours.
If
the
prince
would
keep
them
safe,
he’d
best
do
as
he’s
told.”
He
rose
and
went
to
the
door.
“Someone
will
come
dress
you
and
carry
you
to
the
Great
Hall.
Think
carefully
on
what
you
want
to
say.”

The
waiting
made
Bran
feel
even
more
helpless
than
before.
He
sat
in
the
window
seat,
staring
out
at
dark
towers
and
walls
black
as
shadow.
Once
he
thought
he
heard
shouting
beyond
the
Guards
Hall,
and
something
that
might
have
been
the
clash
of
swords,
but
he
did
not
have
Summer’s
ears
to
hear,
nor
his
nose
to
smell.
Awake,
I
am
still
broken,
but
when
I
sleep,
when
I’m
Summer,
I
can
run
and
fight
and
hear
and
smell.

He
had
expected
that
Hodor
would
come
for
him,
or
maybe
one
of
the
serving
girls,
but
when
the
door
next
opened
it
was
Maester
Luwin,
carrying
a
candle.
“Bran,”
he
said,
“you…
know
what
has
happened?
You
have
been
told?”
The
skin
was
broken
above
his
left
eye,
and
blood
ran
down
that
side
of
his
face.

“Theon
came.
He
said
Winterfell
was
his
now.”

The
maester
set
down
the
candle
and
wiped
the
blood
off
his
cheek.
“They
swam
the
moat.
Climbed
the
walls
with
hook
and
rope.
Came
over
wet
and
dripping,
steel
in
hand.”
He
sat
on
the
chair
by
the
door,
as
fresh
blood
flowed.
“Alebelly
was
on
the
gate,
they
surprised
him
in
the
turret
and
killed
him.
Hayhead’s
wounded
as
well.
I
had
time
to
send
off
two
ravens
before
they
burst
in.
The
bird
to
White
Harbor
got
away,
but
they
brought
down
the
other
with
an
arrow.”
The
maester
stared
at
the
rushes.
“Ser
Rodrik
took
too
many
of
our
men,
but
I
am
to
blame
as
much
as
he
is.
I
never
saw
this
danger,
I
never…”

Jojen
saw
it,
Bran
thought.
“You
better
help
me
dress.”

“Yes,
that’s
so.”
In
the
heavy
ironbound
chest
at
the
foot
of
Bran’s
bed
the
maester
found
smallclothes,
breeches,
and
tunic.
“You
are
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,
and
Robb’s
heir.
You
must
look
princely.”
Together
they
garbed
him
as
befit
a
lord.

“Theon
wants
me
to
yield
the
castle,”
Bran
said
as
the
maester
was
fastening
the
cloak
with
his
favorite
wolf’s-head
clasp
of
silver
and
jet.

“There
is
no
shame
in
that.
A
lord
must
protect
his
smallfolk.
Cruel
places
breed
cruel
peoples,
Bran,
remember
that
as
you
deal
with
these
ironmen.
Your
lord
father
did
what
he
could
to
gentle
Theon,
but
I
fear
it
was
too
little
and
too
late.”

The
ironman
who
came
for
them
was
a
squat
thick-bodied
man
with
a
coal-black
beard
that
covered
half
his
chest.
He
bore
the
boy
easily
enough,
though
he
looked
none
too
happy
with
the
task.
Rickon’s
bedchamber
was
a
half
turn
down
the
steps.
The
four-year-old
was
cranky
at
being
woken.
“I
want
Mother,”
he
said.
“I
want
her.
And
Shaggydog
too.”

“Your
mother
is
far
away,
my
prince.”
Maester
Luwin
pulled
a
bedrobe
over
the
child’s
head.
“But
I’m
here,
and
Bran.”
He
took
Rickon
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out.

Below,
they
came
on
Meera
and
Jojen
being
herded
from
their
room
by
a
bald
man
whose
spear
was
three
feet
taller
than
he
was.
When
Jojen
looked
at
Bran,
his
eyes
were
green
pools
full
of
sorrow.
Other
ironmen
had
rousted
the
Freys.
“Your
brother’s
lost
his
kingdom,”
Little
Walder
told
Bran.
“You’re
no
prince
now,
just
a
hostage.”

“So
are
you,”
Jojen
said,
“and
me,
and
all
of
us.”

“No
one
was
talking
to
you,
frogeater.”

One
of
the
ironmen
went
before
them
carrying
a
torch,
but
the
rain
had
started
again
and
soon
drowned
it
out.
As
they
hurried
across
the
yard
they
could
hear
the
direwolves
howling
in
the
godswood.
I
hope
Summer
wasn’t
hurt
falling
from
the
tree.

Theon
Greyjoy
was
seated
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks.
He
had
taken
off
his
cloak.
Over
a
shirt
of
fine
mail
he
wore
a
black
surcoat
emblazoned
with
the
golden
kraken
of
his
House.
His
hands
rested
on
the
wolves’
heads
carved
at
the
ends
of
the
wide
stone
arms.
“Theon’s
sitting
in
Robb’s
chair,”
Rickon
said.

“Hush,
Rickon.”
Bran
could
feel
the
menace
around
them,
but
his
brother
was
too
young.
A
few
torches
had
been
lit,
and
a
fire
kindled
in
the
great
hearth,
but
most
of
the
hall
remained
in
darkness.
There
was
no
place
to
sit
with
the
benches
stacked
against
the
walls,
so
the
castle
folk
stood
in
small
groups,
not
daring
to
speak.
He
saw
Old
Nan,
her
toothless
mouth
opening
and
closing.
Hayhead
was
carried
in
between
two
of
the
other
guards,
a
bloodstained
bandage
wrapped
about
his
bare
chest.
Poxy
Tym
wept
inconsolably,
and
Beth
Cassel
cried
with
fear.

“What
have
we
here?”
Theon
asked
of
the
Reeds
and
Freys.

“These
are
Lady
Catelyn’s
wards,
both
named
Walder
Frey,”
Maester
Luwin
explained.
“And
this
is
Jojen
Reed
and
his
sister
Meera,
son
and
daughter
to
Howland
Reed
of
Greywater
Watch,
who
came
to
renew
their
oaths
of
fealty
to
Winterfell.”

“Some
might
call
that
ill-timed,”
said
Theon,
“though
not
for
me.
Here
you
are
and
here
you’ll
stay.”
He
vacated
the
high
seat.
“Bring
the
prince
here,
Lorren.”
The
black-bearded
man
dumped
Bran
onto
the
stone
as
if
he
were
a
sack
of
oats.

People
were
still
being
driven
into
the
Great
Hall,
prodded
along
with
shouts
and
the
butts
of
the
spears.
Gage
and
Osha
arrived
from
the
kitchens,
spotted
with
flour
from
making
the
morning
bread.
Mikken
they
dragged
in
cursing.
Farlen
entered
limping,
struggling
to
support
Palla.
Her
dress
had
been
ripped
in
two;
she
held
it
up
with
a
clenched
fist
and
walked
as
if
every
step
were
agony.
Septon
Chayle
rushed
to
lend
a
hand,
but
one
of
the
ironmen
knocked
him
to
the
floor.

The
last
man
marched
through
the
doors
was
the
prisoner
Reek,
whose
stench
preceded
him,
ripe
and
pungent.
Bran
felt
his
stomach
twist
at
the
smell
of
him.
“We
found
this
one
locked
in
a
tower
cell,”
announced
his
escort,
a
beardless
youth
with
ginger-colored
hair
and
sodden
clothing,
doubtless
one
of
those
who’d
swum
the
moat.
“He
says
they
call
him
Reek.”

“Can’t
think
why,”
Theon
said,
smiling.
“Do
you
always
smell
so
bad,
or
did
you
just
finish
fucking
a
pig?”

“Haven’t
fucked
no
one
since
they
took
me,
m’lord.
Heke’s
me
true
name.
I
was
in
service
to
the
Bastard
o’
the
Dreadfort
till
the
Starks
give
him
an
arrow
in
the
back
for
a
wedding
gift.”

Theon
found
that
amusing.
“Who
did
he
marry?”

“The
widow
o’
Hornwood,
m’lord.”

“That
crone?
Was
he
blind?
She
has
teats
like
empty
wineskins,
dry
and
withered.”

“It
wasn’t
her
teats
he
wed
her
for,
m’lord.”

The
ironmen
slammed
shut
the
tall
doors
at
the
foot
of
the
hall.
From
the
high
seat,
Bran
could
see
about
twenty
of
them.
He
probably
left
some
guards
on
the
gates
and
the
armory.
Even
so,
there
couldn’t
be
more
than
thirty.

Theon
raised
his
hands
for
quiet.
“You
all
know
me—”

“Aye,
we
know
you
for
a
sack
of
steaming
dung!”
shouted
Mikken,
before
the
bald
man
drove
the
butt
of
his
spear
into
his
gut,
then
smashed
him
across
the
face
with
the
shaft.
The
smith
stumbled
to
his
knees
and
spat
out
a
tooth.

“Mikken,
you
be
silent.”
Bran
tried
to
sound
stern
and
lordly,
the
way
Robb
did
when
he
made
a
command,
but
his
voice
betrayed
him
and
the
words
came
out
in
a
shrill
squeak.

“Listen
to
your
little
lordling,
Mikken,”
said
Theon.
“He
has
more
sense
than
you
do.”

A
good
lord
protects
his
people,
he
reminded
himself.
“I’ve
yielded
Winterfell
to
Theon.”

“Louder,
Bran.
And
call
me
prince.”

He
raised
his
voice.
“I
have
yielded
Winterfell
to
Prince
Theon.
All
of
you
should
do
as
he
commands
you.”

“Damned
if
I
will!”
bellowed
Mikken.

Theon
ignored
the
outburst.
“My
father
has
donned
the
ancient
crown
of
salt
and
rock,
and
declared
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands.
He
claims
the
north
as
well,
by
right
of
conquest.
You
are
all
his
subjects.”

“Bugger
that.”
Mikken
wiped
the
blood
from
his
mouth.
“I
serve
the
Starks,
not
some
treasonous
squid
of—aah.”
The
butt
of
the
spear
smashed
him
face
first
into
the
stone
floor.

“Smiths
have
strong
arms
and
weak
heads,”
observed
Theon.
“But
if
the
rest
of
you
serve
me
as
loyally
as
you
served
Ned
Stark,
you’ll
find
me
as
generous
a
lord
as
you
could
want.”
on
his
hands
and
knees,
Mikken
spat
blood.
Please
don’t,
Bran
wished
at
him,
but
the
blacksmith
shouted,
“If
you
think
you
can
hold
the
north
with
this
sorry
lot
o’—”

The
bald
man
drove
the
point
of
his
spear
into
the
back
of
Mikken’s
neck.
Steel
slid
through
flesh
and
came
out
his
throat
in
a
welter
of
blood.
A
woman
screamed,
and
Meera
wrapped
her
arms
around
Rickon.
It’s
blood
he
drowned
on,
Bran
thought
numbly.
His
own
blood.

“Who
else
has
something
to
say?”
asked
Theon
Greyjoy.

“Hodor
hodor
hodor
hodor,”
shouted
Hodor,
eyes
wide.

“Someone
kindly
shut
that
halfwit
up.”

Two
ironmen
began
to
beat
Hodor
with
the
butts
of
their
spears.
The
stableboy
dropped
to
the
floor,
trying
to
shield
himself
with
his
hands.

“I
will
be
as
good
a
lord
to
you
as
Eddard
Stark
ever
was.”
Theon
raised
his
voice
to
be
heard
above
the
smack
of
wood
on
flesh.
“Betray
me,
though,
and
you’ll
wish
you
hadn’t.
And
don’t
think
the
men
you
see
here
are
the
whole
of
my
power.
Torrhen’s
Square
and
Deepwood
Motte
will
soon
be
ours
as
well,
and
my
uncle
is
sailing
up
the
Saltspear
to
seize
Moat
Cailin.
If
Robb
Stark
can
stave
off
the
Lannisters,
he
may
reign
as
King
of
the
Trident
hereafter,
but
House
Greyjoy
holds
the
north
now.”

“Stark’s
lords
will
fight
you,”
the
man
Reek
called
out.
“That
bloated
pig
at
White
Harbor
for
one,
and
them
Umbers
and
Karstarks
too.
You’ll
need
men.
Free
me
and
I’m
yours.”

Theon
weighed
him
a
moment.
“You’re
cleverer
than
you
smell,
but
I
could
not
suffer
that
stench.”

“Well,”
said
Reek,
“I
could
wash
some.
If
I
was
free.”

“A
man
of
rare
good
sense.”
Theon
smiled.
“Bend
the
knee.”
one
of
the
ironmen
handed
Reek
a
sword,
and
he
laid
it
at
Theon’s
feet
and
swore
obedience
to
House
Greyjoy
and
King
Balon.
Bran
could
not
look.
The
green
dream
was
coming
true.

“M’lord
Greyjoy!”
Osha
stepped
past
Mikken’s
body.
“I
was
brought
here
captive
too.
You
were
there
the
day
I
was
taken.”

I
thought
you
were
a
friend,
Bran
thought,
hurt.

“I
need
fighters,”
Theon
declared,
“not
kitchen
sluts.”

“It
was
Robb
Stark
put
me
in
the
kitchens.
For
the
best
part
of
a
year,
I’ve
been
left
to
scour
kettles,
scrape
grease,
and
warm
the
straw
for
this
one.”
She
threw
a
look
at
Gage.
“I’ve
had
a
bellyful
of
it.
Put
a
spear
in
my
hand
again.”

“I
got
a
spear
for
you
right
here,”
said
the
bald
man
who’d
killed
Mikken.
He
grabbed
his
crotch,
grinning.

Osha
drove
her
bony
knee
up
between
his
legs.
“You
keep
that
soft
pink
thing.”
She
wrested
the
spear
from
him
and
used
the
butt
to
knock
him
off
his
feet.
“I’ll
have
me
the
wood
and
iron.”
The
bald
man
writhed
on
the
floor
while
the
other
reavers
sent
up
gales
of
laughter.

Theon
laughed
with
the
rest.
“You’ll
do,”
he
said.
“Keep
the
spear;
Stygg
can
find
another.
Now
bend
the
knee
and
swear.”

When
no
one
else
rushed
forward
to
pledge
service,
they
were
dismissed
with
a
warning
to
do
their
work
and
make
no
trouble.
Hodor
was
given
the
task
of
bearing
Bran
back
to
his
bed.
His
face
was
all
ugly
from
the
beating,
his
nose
swollen
and
one
eye
closed.
“Hodor,”
he
sobbed
between
cracked
lips
as
he
lifted
Bran
in
huge
strong
arms
and
bloody
hands
and
carried
him
back
out
into
the
rain.





ARYA

“There’s
ghosts,
I
know
there
is.”
Hot
Pie
was
kneading
bread,
his
arms
floured
up
to
his
elbows.
“Pia
saw
something
in
the
buttery
last
night.”

Arya
made
a
rude
noise.
Pia
was
always
seeing
things
in
the
buttery.
Usually
they
were
men.
“Can
I
have
a
tart?”
she
asked.
“You
baked
a
whole
tray.”

“I
need
a
whole
tray.
Ser
Amory
is
partial
to
them.”

She
hated
Ser
Amory.
“Let’s
spit
on
them.”

Hot
Pie
looked
around
nervously.
The
kitchens
were
full
of
shadows
and
echoes,
but
the
other
cooks
and
scullions
were
all
asleep
in
the
cavernous
lofts
above
the
ovens.
“He’ll
know.”

“He
will
not,”
Arya
said.
“You
can’t
taste
spit.”

“If
he
does,
it’s
me
they’ll
whip.”
Hot
Pie
stopped
his
kneading.
“You
shouldn’t
even
be
here.
It’s
the
black
of
night.”

It
was,
but
Arya
never
minded.
Even
in
the
black
of
night,
the
kitchens
were
never
still;
there
was
always
someone
rolling
dough
for
the
morning
bread,
stirring
a
kettle
with
a
long
wooden
spoon,
or
butchering
a
hog
for
Ser
Amory’s
breakfast
bacon.
Tonight
it
was
Hot
Pie.

“If
Pinkeye
wakes
and
finds
you
gone—”
Hot
Pie
said.

“Pinkeye
never
wakes.”
His
true
name
was
Mebble,
but
everyone
called
him
Pinkeye
for
his
runny
eyes.
“Not
once
he’s
passed
out.”
Each
morning
he
broke
his
fast
with
ale.
Each
evening
he
fell
into
a
drunken
sleep
after
supper,
wine-colored
spit
running
down
his
chin.
Arya
would
wait
until
she
heard
him
snoring,
then
creep
barefoot
up
the
servant’s
stair,
making
no
more
noise
than
the
mouse
she’d
been.
She
carried
neither
candle
nor
taper.
Syrio
had
told
her
once
that
darkness
could
be
her
friend,
and
he
was
right.
If
she
had
the
moon
and
the
stars
to
see
by,
that
was
enough.
“I
bet
we
could
escape,
and
Pinkeye
wouldn’t
even
notice
I
was
gone,”
she
told
Hot
Pie.

“I
don’t
want
to
escape.
It’s
better
here
than
it
was
in
them
woods.
I
don’t
want
to
eat
no
worms.
Here,
sprinkle
some
flour
on
the
board.”

Arya
cocked
her
head.
“What’s
that?”

“What?
I
don’t—”

“Listen
with
your
ears,
not
your
mouth.
That
was
a
warhorn.
Two
blasts,
didn’t
you
hear?
And
there,
that’s
the
portcullis
chains,
someone’s
going
out
or
coming
in.
Want
to
go
see?”
The
gates
of
Harrenhal
had
not
been
opened
since
the
morning
Lord
Tywin
had
marched
with
his
host.

“I’m
making
the
morning
bread,”
Hot
Pie
complained.
“Anyhow
I
don’t
like
it
when
it’s
dark,
I
told
you.”

“I’m
going.
I’ll
tell
you
after.
Can
I
have
a
tart?”

“No.”

She
filched
one
anyway,
and
ate
it
on
her
way
out.
It
was
stuffed
with
chopped
nuts
and
fruit
and
cheese,
the
crust
flaky
and
still
warm
from
the
oven.
Eating
Ser
Amory’s
tart
made
Arya
feel
daring.
Barefoot
surefoot
lightfoot,
she
sang
under
her
breath.
I
am
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal.

The
horn
had
stirred
the
castle
from
sleep;
men
were
coming
out
into
the
ward
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
about.
Arya
fell
in
with
the
others.
A
line
of
ox
carts
were
rumbling
under
the
portcullis.
Plunder,
she
knew
at
once.
The
riders
escorting
the
carts
spoke
in
a
babble
of
queer
tongues.
Their
armor
glinted
pale
in
the
moonlight,
and
she
saw
a
pair
of
striped
black-and-white
zorses.
The
Bloody
Mummers.
Arya
withdrew
a
little
deeper
into
the
shadows,
and
watched
as
a
huge
black
bear
rolled
by,
caged
in
the
back
of
a
wagon.
Other
carts
were
loaded
down
with
silver
plate,
weapons
and
shields,
bags
of
flour,
pens
of
squealing
hogs
and
scrawny
dogs
and
chickens.
Arya
was
thinking
how
long
it
had
been
since
she’d
had
a
slice
off
a
pork
roast
when
she
saw
the
first
of
the
prisoners.

By
his
bearing
and
the
proud
way
he
held
his
head,
he
must
have
been
a
lord.
She
could
see
mail
glinting
beneath
his
torn
red
surcoat.
At
first
Arya
took
him
for
a
Lannister,
but
when
he
passed
near
a
torch
she
saw
his
device
was
a
silver
fist,
not
a
lion.
His
wrists
were
bound
tightly,
and
a
rope
around
one
ankle
tied
him
to
the
man
behind
him,
and
him
to
the
man
behind
him,
so
the
whole
column
had
to
shuffle
along
in
a
lurching
lockstep.
Many
of
the
captives
were
wounded.
If
any
halted,
one
of
the
riders
would
trot
up
and
give
him
a
lick
of
the
whip
to
get
him
moving
again.
She
tried
to
judge
how
many
prisoners
there
were,
but
lost
count
before
she
got
to
fifty.
There
were
twice
that
many
at
least.
Their
clothing
was
stained
with
mud
and
blood,
and
in
the
torchlight
it
was
hard
to
make
out
all
their
badges
and
sigils,
but
some
of
those
Arya
glimpsed
she
recognized.
Twin
towers.
Sunburst.
Bloody
man.
Battle-axe.
The
battle-axe
is
for
Cerwyn,
and
the
white
sun
on
black
is
Karstark.
They’re
northmen.
My
father’s
men,
and
Robb’s.
She
didn’t
like
to
think
what
that
might
mean.

The
Bloody
Mummers
began
to
dismount.
Stableboys
emerged
sleepy
from
their
straw
to
tend
their
lathered
horses.
One
of
the
riders
was
shouting
for
ale.
The
noise
brought
Ser
Amory
Lorch
out
onto
the
covered
gallery
above
the
ward,
flanked
by
two
torchbearers.
Goat-helmed
Vargo
Hoat
reined
up
below
him.
“My
lord
cathellan,”
the
sellsword
said.
He
had
a
thick,
slobbery
voice,
as
if
his
tongue
was
too
big
for
his
mouth.

“What’s
all
this,
Hoat?”
Ser
Amory
demanded,
frowning.

“Captiths.
Rooth
Bolton
thought
to
croth
the
river,
but
my
Brafe
Companions
cut
his
van
to
pieceth.
Killed
many,
and
thent
Bolton
running.
Thith
ith
their
lord
commander,
Glover,
and
the
one
behind
ith
Ther
Aenyth
Frey.”

Ser
Amory
Lorch
stared
down
at
the
roped
captives
with
his
little
pig
eyes.
Arya
did
not
think
he
was
pleased.
Everyone
in
the
castle
knew
that
he
and
Vargo
Hoat
hated
each
other.
“Very
well,”
he
said.
“Ser
Cadwyn,
take
these
men
to
the
dungeons.”

The
lord
with
the
mailed
fist
on
his
surcoat
raised
his
eyes.
“We
were
promised
honorable
treatment—”
he
began.

“Silenth!”
Vargo
Hoat
screamed
at
him,
spraying
spittle.

Ser
Amory
addressed
the
captives.
“What
Hoat
promised
you
is
nothing
to
me.
Lord
Tywin
made
me
the
castellan
of
Harrenhal,
and
I
shall
do
with
you
as
I
please.”
He
gestured
to
his
guards.
“The
great
cell
under
the
Widow’s
Tower
ought
to
hold
them
all.
Any
who
do
not
care
to
go
are
free
to
die
here.”

As
his
men
herded
off
the
captives
at
spearpoint,
Arya
saw
Pinkeye
emerge
from
the
stairwell,
blinking
at
the
torchlight.
If
he
found
her
missing,
he
would
shout
and
threaten
to
whip
the
bloody
hide
off
her,
but
she
was
not
afraid.
He
was
no
Weese.
He
was
forever
threatening
to
whip
the
bloody
hide
off
this
one
or
that
one,
but
Arya
never
actually
knew
him
to
hit.
Still,
it
would
be
better
if
he
never
saw
her.
She
glanced
around.
The
oxen
were
being
unharnessed,
the
carts
unloaded,
while
the
Brave
Companions
clamored
for
drink
and
the
curious
gathered
around
the
caged
bear.
In
the
commotion,
it
was
not
hard
to
slip
off
unseen.
She
went
back
the
way
she
had
come,
wanting
to
be
out
of
sight
before
someone
noticed
her
and
thought
to
put
her
to
work.

Away
from
the
gates
and
the
stables,
the
great
castle
was
largely
deserted.
The
noise
dwindled
behind
her.
A
swirling
wind
gusted,
drawing
a
high
shivery
scream
from
the
cracks
in
the
Wailing
Tower.
Leaves
had
begun
to
fall
from
the
trees
in
the
godswood,
and
she
could
hear
them
moving
through
the
deserted
courtyards
and
between
the
empty
buildings,
making
a
faint
skittery
sound
as
the
wind
drove
them
across
the
stones.
Now
that
Harrenhal
was
near
empty
once
again,
sound
did
queer
things
here.
Sometimes
the
stones
seemed
to
drink
up
noise,
shrouding
the
yards
in
a
blanket
of
silence.
Other
times,
the
echoes
had
a
life
of
their
own,
so
every
footfall
became
the
tread
of
a
ghostly
army,
and
every
distant
voice
a
ghostly
feast.
The
funny
sounds
were
one
of
the
things
that
bothered
Hot
Pie,
but
not
Arya.

Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
flitted
across
the
middle
bailey,
around
the
Tower
of
Dread,
and
through
the
empty
mews,
where
people
said
the
spirits
of
dead
falcons
stirred
the
air
with
ghostly
wings.
She
could
go
where
she
would.
The
garrison
numbered
no
more
than
a
hundred
men,
so
small
a
troop
that
they
were
lost
in
Harrenhal.
The
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths
was
closed
off,
along
with
many
of
the
lesser
buildings,
even
the
Wailing
Tower.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
resided
in
the
castellan’s
chambers
in
Kingspyre,
themselves
as
spacious
as
a
lord’s,
and
Arya
and
the
other
servants
had
moved
to
the
cellars
beneath
him
so
they
would
be
close
at
hand.
While
Lord
Tywin
had
been
in
residence,
there
was
always
a
man-at-arms
wanting
to
know
your
business.
But
now
there
were
only
a
hundred
men
left
to
guard
a
thousand
doors,
and
no
one
seemed
to
know
who
should
be
where,
or
care
much.

As
she
passed
the
armory,
Arya
heard
the
ring
of
a
hammer.
A
deep
orange
glow
shone
through
the
high
windows.
She
climbed
to
the
roof
and
peeked
down.
Gendry
was
beating
out
a
breastplate.
When
he
worked,
nothing
existed
for
him
but
metal,
bellows,
fire.
The
hammer
was
like
part
of
his
arm.
She
watched
the
play
of
muscles
in
his
chest
and
listened
to
the
steel
music
he
made.
He’s
strong,
she
thought.
As
he
took
up
the
long-handled
tongs
to
dip
the
breastplate
into
the
quenching
trough,
Arya
slithered
through
the
window
and
leapt
down
to
the
floor
beside
him.

He
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
her.
“You
should
be
abed,
girl.”
The
breastplate
hissed
like
a
cat
as
he
dipped
it
in
the
cold
water.
“What
was
all
that
noise?”

“Vargo
Hoat’s
come
back
with
prisoners.
I
saw
their
badges.
There’s
a
Glover,
from
Deepwood
Motte,
he’s
my
father’s
man.
The
rest
too,
mostly.”
All
of
a
sudden,
Arya
knew
why
her
feet
had
brought
her
here.
“You
have
to
help
me
get
them
out.”

Gendry
laughed.
“And
how
do
we
do
that?”

“Ser
Amory
sent
them
down
to
the
dungeon.
The
one
under
the
Widow’s
Tower,
that’s
just
one
big
cell.
You
could
smash
the
door
open
with
your
hammer—”

“While
the
guards
watch
and
make
bets
on
how
many
swings
it
will
take
me,
maybe?”

Arya
chewed
her
lips.
“We’d
need
to
kill
the
guards.”

“How
are
we
supposed
to
do
that?”

“Maybe
there
won’t
be
a
lot
of
them.”

“If
there’s
two,
that’s
too
many
for
you
and
me.
You
never
learned
nothing
in
that
village,
did
you?
You
try
this
and
Vargo
Hoat
will
cut
off
your
hands
and
feet,
the
way
he
does.”
Gendry
took
up
the
tongs
again.

“You’re
afraid.”

“Leave
me
alone,
girl.”

“Gendry,
there’s
a
hundred
northmen.
Maybe
more,
I
couldn’t
count
them
all.
That’s
as
many
as
Ser
Amory
has.
Well,
not
counting
the
Bloody
Mummers.
We
just
have
to
get
them
out
and
we
can
take
over
the
castle
and
escape.”

“Well,
you
can’t
get
them
out,
no
more’n
you
could
save
Lommy.”
Gendry
turned
the
breastplate
with
the
tongs
to
look
at
it
closely.
“And
if
we
did
escape,
where
would
we
go?”

“Winterfell,”
she
said
at
once.
“I’d
tell
Mother
how
you
helped
me,
and
you
could
stay—”

“Would
m’lady
permit?
Could
I
shoe
your
horses
for
you,
and
make
swords
for
your
lordly
brothers?”

Sometimes
he
made
her
so
angry.
“You
stop
that!”

“Why
should
I
wager
my
feet
for
the
chance
to
sweat
in
Winterfell
in
place
of
Harrenhal?
You
know
old
Ben
Blackthumb?
He
came
here
as
a
boy.
Smithed
for
Lady
Whent
and
her
father
before
her
and
his
father
before
him,
and
even
for
Lord
Lothston
who
held
Harrenhal
before
the
Whents.
Now
he
smiths
for
Lord
Tywin,
and
you
know
what
he
says?
A
sword’s
a
sword,
a
helm’s
a
helm,
and
if
you
reach
in
the
fire
you
get
burned,
no
matter
who
you’re
serving.
Lucan’s
a
fair
enough
master.
I’ll
stay
here.”

“The
queen
will
catch
you,
then.
She
didn’t
send
gold
cloaks
after
Ben
Blackthumb!”

“Likely
it
wasn’t
even
me
they
wanted.”

“It
was
too,
you
know
it.
You’re
somebody.”

“I’m
a
’prentice
smith,
and
one
day
might
be
I’ll
make
a
master
armorer…
if
I
don’t
run
off
and
lose
my
feet
or
get
myself
killed.”
He
turned
away
from
her,
picked
up
his
hammer
once
more,
and
began
to
bang.

Arya’s
hands
curled
into
helpless
fists.
“The
next
helm
you
make,
put
mule’s
ears
on
it
in
place
of
bull’s
horns!”
She
had
to
flee,
or
else
she
would
have
started
hitting
him.
He
probably
wouldn’t
even
feel
it
if
I
did.
When
they
find
who
he
is
and
cut
off
his
stupid
mulehead,
he’ll
be
sorry
he
didn’t
help.
She
was
better
off
without
him
anyhow.
He
was
the
one
who
got
her
caught
at
the
village.

But
thinking
of
the
village
made
her
remember
the
march,
and
the
storeroom,
and
the
Tickler.
She
thought
of
the
little
boy
who’d
been
hit
in
the
face
with
the
mace,
of
stupid
old
All-for-Joffrey,
of
Lommy
Greenhands.
I
was
a
sheep,
and
then
I
was
a
mouse,
I
couldn’t
do
anything
but
hide.
Arya
chewed
her
lip
and
tried
to
think
when
her
courage
had
come
back.
Jaqen
made
me
brave
again.
He
made
me
a
ghost
instead
of
a
mouse.

She
had
been
avoiding
the
Lorathi
since
Weese’s
death.
Chiswyck
had
been
easy,
anyone
could
push
a
man
off
the
wallwalk,
but
Weese
had
raised
that
ugly
spotted
dog
from
a
pup,
and
only
some
dark
magic
could
have
turned
the
animal
against
him.
Yoren
found
Jaqen
in
a
black
cell,
the
same
as
Rorge
and
Biter,
she
remembered.
Jaqen
did
something
horrible
and
Yoren
knew,
that’s
why
he
kept
him
in
chains.
If
the
Lorathi
was
a
wizard,
Rorge
and
Biter
could
be
demons
he
called
up
from
some
hell,
not
men
at
all.

Jaqen
still
owed
her
one
death.
In
Old
Nan’s
stories
about
men
who
were
given
magic
wishes
by
a
grumkin,
you
had
to
be
especially
careful
with
the
third
wish,
because
it
was
the
last.
Chiswyck
and
Weese
hadn’t
been
very
important.
The
last
death
has
to
count,
Arya
told
herself
every
night
when
she
whispered
her
names.
But
now
she
wondered
if
that
was
truly
the
reason
she
had
hesitated.
So
long
as
she
could
kill
with
a
whisper,
Arya
need
not
be
afraid
of
anyone…
but
once
she
used
up
the
last
death,
she
would
only
be
a
mouse
again.

With
Pinkeye
awake,
she
dared
not
go
back
to
her
bed.
Not
knowing
where
else
to
hide,
she
made
for
the
godswood.
She
liked
the
sharp
smell
of
the
pines
and
sentinels,
the
feel
of
grass
and
dirt
between
her
toes,
and
the
sound
the
wind
made
in
the
leaves.
A
slow
little
stream
meandered
through
the
wood,
and
there
was
one
spot
where
it
had
eaten
the
ground
away
beneath
a
deadfall.

There,
beneath
rotting
wood
and
twisted
splintered
branches,
she
found
her
hidden
sword.

Gendry
was
too
stubborn
to
make
one
for
her,
so
she
had
made
her
own
by
breaking
the
bristles
off
a
broom.
Her
blade
was
much
too
light
and
had
no
proper
grip,
but
she
liked
the
sharp
jagged
splintery
end.

Whenever
she
had
a
free
hour
she
stole
away
to
work
at
the
drills
Syrio
had
taught
her,
moving
barefoot
over
the
fallen
leaves,
slashing
at
branches
and
whacking
down
leaves.
Sometimes
she
even
climbed
the
trees
and
danced
among
the
upper
branches,
her
toes
gripping
the
limbs
as
she
moved
back
and
forth,
teetering
a
little
less
every
day
as
her
balance
returned
to
her.
Night
was
the
best
time;
no
one
ever
bothered
her
at
night.

Arya
climbed.
Up
in
the
kingdom
of
the
leaves,
she
unsheathed
and
for
a
time
forgot
them
all,
Ser
Amory
and
the
Mummers
and
her
father’s
men
alike,
losing
herself
in
the
feel
of
rough
wood
beneath
the
soles
of
her
feet
and
the
swish
of
sword
through
air.
A
broken
branch
became
Joffrey.
She
struck
at
it
until
it
fell
away.
The
queen
and
Ser
Ilyn
and
Ser
Meryn
and
the
Hound
were
only
leaves,
but
she
killed
them
all
as
well,
slashing
them
to
wet
green
ribbons.
When
her
arm
grew
weary,
she
sat
with
her
legs
over
a
high
limb
to
catch
her
breath
in
the
cool
dark
air,
listening
to
the
squeak
of
bats
as
they
hunted.
Through
the
leafy
canopy
she
could
see
the
bone-white
branches
of
the
heart
tree.
It
looks
just
like
the
one
in
Winterfell
from
here.
If
only
it
had
been…
then
when
she
climbed
down
she
would
have
been
home
again,
and
maybe
find
her
father
sitting
under
the
weirwood
where
he
always
sat.

Shoving
her
sword
through
her
belt,
she
slipped
down
branch
to
branch
until
she
was
back
on
the
ground.
The
light
of
the
moon
painted
the
limbs
of
the
weirwood
silvery
white
as
she
made
her
way
toward
it,
but
the
five-pointed
red
leaves
turned
black
by
night.
Arya
stared
at
the
face
carved
into
its
trunk.
It
was
a
terrible
face,
its
mouth
twisted,
its
eyes
flaring
and
full
of
hate.
Is
that
what
a
god
looked
like?
Could
gods
be
hurt,
the
same
as
people?
I
should
pray,
she
thought
suddenly.

Arya
went
to
her
knees.
She
wasn’t
sure
how
she
should
begin.
She
clasped
her
hands
together.
Help
me,
you
old
gods,
she
prayed
silently.
Help
me
get
those
men
out
of
the
dungeon
so
we
can
kill
Ser
Amory,
and
bring
me
home
to
Winterfell.
Make
me
=======
he
signed
the
letter
Eddard
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell,
Hand
of
the
King,
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
blotted
the
paper,
folded
it
twice,
and
melted
the
sealing
wax
over
the
candle
flame.

His
regency
would
be
a
short
one,
he
reflected
as
the
wax
softened.
The
new
king
would
choose
his
own
Hand.
Ned
would
be
free
to
go
home.
The
thought
of
Winterfell
brought
a
wan
smile
to
his
face.
He
wanted
to
hear
Bran’s
laughter
once
more,
to
go
hawking
with
Robb,
to
watch
Rickon
at
play.
He
wanted
to
drift
off
to
a
dreamless
sleep
in
his
own
bed
with
his
arms
wrapped
tight
around
his
lady,
Catelyn.

Cayn
returned
as
he
was
pressing
the
direwolf
seal
down
into
the
soft
white
wax.
Desmond
was
with
him,
and
between
them
Littlefinger.
Ned
thanked
his
guards
and
sent
them
away.

Lord
Petyr
was
clad
in
a
blue
velvet
tunic
with
puffed
sleeves,
his
silvery
cape
patterned
with
mockingbirds.
“I
suppose
congratulations
are
in
order,”
he
said
as
he
seated
himself.

Ned
scowled.
“The
king
lies
wounded
and
near
to
death.”

“I
know,”
Littlefinger
said.
“I
also
know
that
Robert
has
named
you
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

Ned’s
eyes
flicked
to
the
king’s
letter
on
the
table
beside
him,
its
seal
unbroken.
“And
how
is
it
you
know
that,
my
lord?”

“Varys
hinted
as
much,”
Littlefinger
said,
“and
you
have
just
confirmed
it.”

Ned’s
mouth
twisted
in
anger.
“Damn
Varys
and
his
little
birds.
Catelyn
spoke
truly,
the
man
has
some
black
art.
I
do
not
trust
him.”

“Excellent.
You’re
learning.”
Littlefinger
leaned
forward.
“Yet
I’ll
wager
you
did
not
drag
me
here
in
the
black
of
night
to
discuss
the
eunuch.”

“No,”
Ned
admitted.
“I
know
the
secret
Jon
Arryn
was
murdered
to
protect.
Robert
will
leave
no
trueborn
son
behind
him.
Joffrey
and
Tommen
are
Jaime
Lannister’s
bastards,
born
of
his
incestuous
union
with
the
queen.”

Littlefinger
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Shocking,”
he
said
in
a
tone
that
suggested
he
was
not
shocked
at
all.
“The
girl
as
well?
No
doubt.
So
when
the
king
dies…”

“The
throne
by
rights
passes
to
Lord
Stannis,
the
elder
of
Robert’s
two
brothers.”

Lord
Petyr
stroked
his
pointed
beard
as
he
considered
the
matter.
“So
it
would
seem.
Unless…”

“Unless,
my
lord?
There
is
no
seeming
to
this.
Stannis
is
the
heir.
Nothing
can
change
that.”

“Stannis
cannot
take
the
throne
without
your
help.
If
you’re
wise,
you’ll
make
certain
Joffrey
succeeds.”

Ned
gave
him
a
stony
stare.
“Have
you
no
shred
of
honor?”

“Oh,
a
shred,
surely,”
Littlefinger
replied
negligently.
“Hear
me
out.
Stannis
is
no
friend
of
yours,
nor
of
mine.
Even
his
brothers
can
scarcely
stomach
him.
The
man
is
iron,
hard
and
unyielding.
He’ll
give
us
a
new
Hand
and
a
new
council,
for
a
certainty.
No
doubt
he’ll
thank
you
for
handing
him
the
crown,
but
he
won’t
love
you
for
it.
And
his
ascent
will
mean
war.
Stannis
cannot
rest
easy
on
the
throne
until
Cersei
and
her
bastards
are
dead.
Do
you
think
Lord
Tywin
will
sit
idly
while
his
daughter’s
head
is
measured
for
a
spike?
Casterly
Rock
will
rise,
and
not
alone.
Robert
found
it
in
him
to
pardon
men
who
served
King
Aerys,
so
long
as
they
did
him
fealty.
Stannis
is
less
forgiving.
He
will
not
have
forgotten
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End,
and
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
dare
not.
Every
man
who
fought
beneath
the
dragon
banner
or
rose
with
Balon
Greyjoy
will
have
good
cause
to
fear.
Seat
Stannis
on
the
Iron
Throne
and
I
promise
you,
the
realm
will
bleed.

“Now
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
Joffrey
is
but
twelve,
and
Robert
gave
you
the
regency,
my
lord.
You
are
the
Hand
of
the
King
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
The
power
is
yours,
Lord
Stark.
All
you
need
do
is
reach
out
and
take
it.
Make
your
peace
with
the
Lannisters.
Release
the
Imp.
Wed
Joffrey
to
your
Sansa.
Wed
your
younger
girl
to
Prince
Tommen,
and
your
heir
to
Myrcella.
It
will
be
four
years
before
Joffrey
comes
of
age.
By
then
he
will
look
to
you
as
a
second
father,
and
if
not,
well…
four
years
is
a
good
long
while,
my
lord.
Long
enough
to
dispose
of
Lord
Stannis.
Then,
should
Joffrey
prove
troublesome,
we
can
reveal
his
little
secret
and
put
Lord
Renly
on
the
throne.”

“We?”
Ned
repeated.

Littlefinger
gave
a
shrug.
“You’ll
need
someone
to
share
your
burdens.
I
assure
you,
my
price
would
be
modest.”

“Your
price.”
Ned’s
voice
was
ice.
“Lord
Baelish,
what
you
suggest
is
treason.”

“Only
if
we
lose.”

“You
forget,”
Ned
told
him.
“You
forget
Jon
Arryn.
You
forget
Jory
Cassel.
And
you
forget
this.”
He
drew
the
dagger
and
laid
it
on
the
table
between
them;
a
length
of
dragonbone
and
Valyrian
steel,
as
sharp
as
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong,
between
true
and
false,
between
life
and
death.
“They
sent
a
man
to
cut
my
son’s
throat,
Lord
Baelish.”

Littlefinger
sighed.
“I
fear
I
did
forget,
my
lord.
Pray
forgive
me.
For
a
moment
I
did
not
remember
that
I
was
talking
to
a
Stark.”
His
mouth
quirked.
“So
it
will
be
Stannis,
and
war?”

“It
is
not
a
choice.
Stannis
is
the
heir.”

“Far
be
it
from
me
to
dispute
the
Lord
Protector.
What
would
you
have
of
me,
then?
Not
my
wisdom,
for
a
certainty.”

“I
shall
do
my
best
to
forget
your…
wisdom,”
Ned
said
with
distaste.
“I
called
you
here
to
ask
for
the
help
you
promised
Catelyn.
This
is
a
perilous
hour
for
all
of
us.
Robert
has
named
me
Protector,
true
enough,
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
world,
Joffrey
is
still
his
son
and
heir.
The
queen
has
a
dozen
knights
and
a
hundred
men-at-arms
who
will
do
whatever
she
commands…
enough
to
overwhelm
what
remains
of
my
own
household
guard.
And
for
all
I
know,
her
brother
Jaime
may
be
riding
for
King’s
Landing
even
as
we
speak,
with
a
Lannister
host
at
his
back.”

“And
you
without
an
army.”
Littlefinger
toyed
with
the
dagger
on
the
table,
turning
it
slowly
with
a
finger.
“There
is
small
love
lost
between
Lord
Renly
and
the
Lannisters.
Bronze
Yohn
Royce,
Ser
Balon
Swann,
Ser
Loras,
Lady
Tanda,
the
Redwyne
twins…
each
of
them
has
a
retinue
of
knights
and
sworn
swords
here
at
court.”

“Renly
has
thirty
men
in
his
personal
guard,
the
rest
even
fewer.
It
is
not
enough,
even
if
I
could
be
certain
that
all
of
them
will
choose
to
give
me
their
allegiance.
I
must
have
the
gold
cloaks.
The
City
Watch
is
two
thousand
strong,
sworn
to
defend
the
castle,
the
city,
and
the
king’s
peace.”

“Ah,
but
when
the
queen
proclaims
one
king
and
the
Hand
another,
whose
peace
do
they
protect?”
Lord
Petyr
flicked
at
the
dagger
with
his
finger,
setting
it
spinning
in
place.
Round
and
round
it
went,
wobbling
as
it
turned.
When
at
last
it
slowed
to
a
stop,
the
blade
pointed
at
Littlefinger.
“Why,
there’s
your
answer,”
he
said,
smiling.
“They
follow
the
man
who
pays
them.”
He
leaned
back
and
looked
Ned
full
in
the
face,
his
grey-green
eyes
bright
with
mockery.
“You
wear
your
honor
like
a
suit
of
armor,
Stark.
You
think
it
keeps
you
safe,
but
all
it
does
is
weigh
you
down
and
make
it
hard
for
you
to
move.
Look
at
you
now.
You
know
why
you
summoned
me
here.
You
know
what
you
want
to
ask
me
to
do.
You
know
it
has
to
be
done…
but
it’s
not
honorable,
so
the
words
stick
in
your
throat.”

Ned’s
neck
was
rigid
with
tension.
For
a
moment
he
was
so
angry
that
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak.

Littlefinger
laughed.
“I
ought
to
make
you
say
it,
but
that
would
be
cruel…
so
have
no
fear,
my
good
lord.
For
the
sake
of
the
love
I
bear
for
Catelyn,
I
will
go
to
Janos
Slynt
this
very
hour
and
make
certain
that
the
City
Watch
is
yours.
Six
thousand
gold
pieces
should
do
it.
A
third
for
the
Commander,
a
third
for
the
officers,
a
third
for
the
men.
We
might
be
able
to
buy
them
for
half
that
much,
but
I
prefer
not
to
take
chances.”
Smiling,
he
plucked
up
the
dagger
and
offered
it
to
Ned,
hilt
first.





JON

Jon
was
breaking
his
fast
on
applecakes
and
blood
sausage
when
Samwell
Tarly
plopped
himself
down
on
the
bench.
“I’ve
been
summoned
to
the
sept,”
Sam
said
in
an
excited
whisper.
“They’re
passing
me
out
of
training.
I’m
to
be
made
a
brother
with
the
rest
of
you.
Can
you
believe
it?”

“No,
truly?”

“Truly.
I’m
to
assist
Maester
Aemon
with
the
library
and
the
birds.
He
needs
someone
who
can
read
and
write
letters.”

“You’ll
do
well
at
that,”
Jon
said,
smiling.

Sam
glanced
about
anxiously.
“Is
it
time
to
go?
I
shouldn’t
be
late,
they
might
change
their
minds.”
He
was
fairly
bouncing
as
they
crossed
the
weed-strewn
courtyard.
The
day
was
warm
and
sunny.
Rivulets
of
water
trickled
down
the
sides
of
the
Wall,
so
the
ice
seemed
to
sparkle
and
shine.

Inside
the
sept,
the
great
crystal
caught
the
morning
light
as
it
streamed
through
the
south-facing
window
and
spread
it
in
a
rainbow
on
the
altar.
Pyp’s
mouth
dropped
open
when
he
caught
sight
of
Sam,
and
Toad
poked
Grenn
in
the
ribs,
but
no
one
dared
say
a
word.
Septon
Celladar
was
swinging
a
censer,
filling
the
air
with
fragrant
incense
that
reminded
Jon
of
Lady
Stark’s
little
sept
in
Winterfell.
For
once
the
septon
seemed
sober.

The
high
officers
arrived
in
a
body;
Maester
Aemon
leaning
on
Clydas,
Ser
Alliser
cold-eyed
and
grim,
Lord
Commander
Mormont
resplendent
in
a
black
wool
doublet
with
silvered
bearclaw
fastenings.
Behind
them
came
the
senior
members
of
the
three
orders:
red-faced
Bowen
Marsh
the
Lord
Steward,
First
Builder
Othell
Yarwyck,
and
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
who
commanded
the
rangers
in
the
absence
of
Benjen
Stark.

Mormont
stood
before
the
altar,
the
rainbow
shining
on
his
broad
bald
head.
“You
came
to
us
outlaws,”
he
began,
“poachers,
rapers,
debtors,
killers,
and
thieves.
You
came
to
us
children.
You
came
to
us
alone,
in
chains,
with
neither
friends
nor
honor.
You
came
to
us
rich,
and
you
came
to
us
poor.
Some
of
you
bear
the
names
of
proud
houses.
Others
have
only
bastards’
names,
or
no
names
at
all.
It
makes
no
matter.
All
that
is
past
now.
On
the
Wall,
we
are
all
one
house.

“At
evenfall,
as
the
sun
sets
and
we
face
the
gathering
night,
you
shall
take
your
vows.
From
that
moment,
you
will
be
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Your
crimes
will
be
washed
away,
your
debts
forgiven.
So
too
you
must
wash
away
your
former
loyalties,
put
aside
your
grudges,
forget
old
wrongs
and
old
loves
alike.
Here
you
begin
anew.

“A
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
lives
his
life
for
the
realm.
Not
for
a
king,
nor
a
lord,
nor
the
honor
of
this
house
or
that
house,
neither
for
gold
nor
glory
nor
a
woman’s
love,
but
for
the
realm,
and
all
the
people
in
it.
A
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
wife
and
fathers
no
sons.
Our
wife
is
duty.
Our
mistress
is
honor.
And
you
are
the
only
sons
we
shall
ever
know.

“You
have
learned
the
words
of
the
vow.
Think
carefully
before
you
say
them,
for
once
you
have
taken
the
black,
there
is
no
turning
back.
The
penalty
for
desertion
is
death.”
The
Old
Bear
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
said,
“Are
there
any
among
you
who
wish
to
leave
our
company?
If
so,
go
now,
and
no
one
shall
think
the
less
of
you.”

No
one
moved.

“Well
and
good,”
said
Mormont.
“You
may
take
your
vows
here
at
evenfall,
before
Septon
Celladar
and
the
first
of
your
order.
Do
any
of
you
keep
to
the
old
gods?”

Jon
stood.
“I
do,
my
lord.”

“I
expect
you
will
want
to
say
your
words
before
a
heart
tree,
as
your
uncle
did,”
Mormont
said.

“Yes,
my
lord,”
Jon
said.
The
gods
of
the
sept
had
nothing
to
do
with
him;
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks.

He
heard
Grenn
whispering
behind
him.
“There’s
no
godswood
here.
Is
there?
I
never
saw
a
godswood.”

“You
wouldn’t
see
a
herd
of
aurochs
until
they
trampled
you
into
the
snow,”
Pyp
whispered
back.

“I
would
so,”
Grenn
insisted.
“I’d
see
them
a
long
way
off.”

Mormont
himself
confirmed
Grenn’s
doubts.
“Castle
Black
has
no
need
of
a
godswood.
Beyond
the
Wall
the
haunted
forest
stands
as
it
stood
in
the
Dawn
Age,
long
before
the
Andals
brought
the
Seven
across
the
narrow
sea.
You
will
find
a
grove
of
weirwoods
half
a
league
from
this
spot,
and
mayhap
your
gods
as
well.”

“My
lord.”
The
voice
made
Jon
glance
back
in
surprise.
Samwell
Tarly
was
on
his
feet.
The
fat
boy
wiped
his
sweaty
palms
against
his
tunic.
“Might
I…
might
I
go
as
well?
To
say
my
words
at
this
heart
tree?”

“Does
House
Tarly
keep
the
old
gods
too?”
Mormont
asked.

“No,
my
lord,”
Sam
replied
in
a
thin,
nervous
voice.
The
high
officers
frightened
him,
Jon
knew,
the
Old
Bear
most
of
all.
“I
was
named
in
the
light
of
the
Seven
at
the
sept
on
Horn
Hill,
as
my
father
was,
and
his
father,
and
all
the
Tarlys
for
a
thousand
years.”

“Why
would
you
forsake
the
gods
of
your
father
and
your
House?”
wondered
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker.

“The
Night’s
Watch
is
my
House
now,”
Sam
said.
“The
Seven
have
never
answered
my
prayers.
Perhaps
the
old
gods
will.”

“As
you
wish,
boy,”
Mormont
said.
Sam
took
his
seat
again,
as
did
Jon.
“We
have
placed
each
of
you
in
an
order,
as
befits
our
need
and
your
own
strengths
and
skills.”
Bowen
Marsh
stepped
forward
and
handed
him
a
paper.
The
Lord
Commander
unrolled
it
and
began
to
read.
“Haider,
to
the
builders,”
he
began.
Haider
gave
a
stiff
nod
of
approval.
“Grenn,
to
the
rangers.
Albett,
to
the
builders.
Pypar,
to
the
rangers.”
Pyp
looked
over
at
Jon
and
wiggled
his
ears.
“Samwell,
to
the
stewards.”
Sam
sagged
with
relief,
mopping
at
his
brow
with,a
scrap
of
silk.
“Matthar,
to
the
rangers.
Dareon,
to
the
stewards.
Todder,
to
the
rangers.
Jon,
to
the
stewards.”

The
stewards?
For
a
moment
Jon
could
not
believe
what
he
had
heard.
Mormont
must
have
read
it
wrong.
He
started
to
rise,
to
open
his
mouth,
to
tell
them
there
had
been
a
mistake…
and
then
he
saw
Ser
Alliser
studying
him,
eyes
shiny
as
two
flakes
of
obsidian,
and
he
knew.

The
Old
Bear
rolled
up
the
paper.
“Your
firsts
will
instruct
you
in
your
duties.
May
all
the
gods
preserve
you,
brothers.”
The
Lord
Commander
favored
them
with
a
half
bow,
and
took
his
leave.
Ser
Alliser
went
with
him,
a
thin
smile
on
his
face.
Jon
had
never
seen
the
master-at-arms
took
quite
so
happy.

“Rangers
with
me,”
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
called
when
they
were
gone.
Pyp
was
staring
at
Jon
as
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet.
His
ears
were
red.
Grenn,
grinning
broadly,
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
anything
was
amiss.
Matt
and
Toad
fell
in
beside
them,
and
they
followed
Ser
Jaremy
from
the
sept.

“Builders,”
announced
lantern-jawed
Othell
Yarwyck.
Haider
and
Albett
trailed
out
after
him.

Jon
looked
around
him
in
sick
disbelief.
Maester
Aemon’s
blind
eyes
were
raised
toward
the
light
he
could
not
see.
The
septon
was
arranging
crystals
on
the
altar.
Only
Sam
and
Darcon
remained
on
the
benches;
a
fat
boy,
a
singer…
and
him.

Lord
Steward
Bowen
Marsh
rubbed
his
plump
hands
together.
“Samwell,
you
will
assist
Maester
Aemon
in
the
rookery
and
library.
Chett
is
going
to
the
kennels,
to
help
with
the
hounds.
You
shall
have
his
cell,
so
as
to
be
close
to
the
maester
night
and
day.
I
trust
you
will
take
good
care
of
him.
He
is
very
old
and
very
precious
to
us.

“Dareon,
I
am
told
that
you
sang
at
many
a
high
lord’s
table
and
shared
their
meat
and
mead.
We
are
sending
you
to
Eastwatch.
It
may
be
your
palate
will
be
some
help
to
Cotter
Pyke
when
merchant
galleys
come
trading.
We
are
paying
too
dear
for
salt
beef
and
pickled
fish,
and
the
quality
of
the
olive
oil
we’re
getting
has
been
frightful,
Present
yourself
to
Borcas
when
you
arrive,
he
will
keep
you
busy
between
ships.”

Marsh
turned
his
smile
on
Jon.
“Lord
Commander
Mormont
has
requested
you
for
his
personal
steward,
Jon.
You’ll
sleep
in
a
cell
beneath
his
chambers,
in
the
Lord
Commander’s
tower.”

“And
what
will
my
duties
be?”
Jon
asked
sharply.
“Will
I
serve
the
Lord
Commander’s
meals,
help
him
fasten
his
clothes,
fetch
hot
water
for
his
bath?”

“Certainly.”
Marsh
frowned
at
Jon’s
tone.
“And
you
will
run
his
messages,
keep
a
fire
burning
in
his
chambers,
change
his
sheets
and
blankets
daily,
and
do
all
else
that
the
Lord
Commander
might
require
of
you.”

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
servant?”

“No,”
Maester
Aemon
said,
from
the
back
of
the
sept.
Clydas
helped
him
stand.
“We
took
you
for
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch…
but
perhaps
we
were
wrong
in
that.”

It
was
all
Jon
could
do
to
stop
himself
from
walking
out.
Was
he
supposed
to
churn
butter
and
sew
doublets
like
a
girl
for
the
rest
of
his
days?
“May
I
go?”
he
asked
stiffly.

“As
you
wish,”
Bowen
Marsh
responded.

Dareon
and
Sam
left
with
him.
They
descended
to
the
yard
in
silence.
Outside,
Jon
looked
up
at
the
Wall
shining
in
the
sun,
the
melting
ice
creeping
down
its
side
in
a
hundred
thin
fingers.
Jon’s
rage
was
such
that
he
would
have
smashed
it
all
in
an
instant,
and
the
world
be
damned.

“Jon,”
Samwell
Tarly
said
excitedly.
“Wait.
Don’t
you
see
what
they’re
doing?”

Jon
turned
on
him
in
a
fury.
“I
see
Ser
Alliser’s
bloody
hand,
that’s
all
I
see.
He
wanted
to
shame
me,
and
he
has.”

Dareon
gave
him
a
look.
“The
stewards
are
fine
for
the
likes
of
you
and
me,
Sam,
but
not
for
Lord
Snow.”

“I’m
a
better
swordsman
and
a
better
rider
than
any
of
you,”
Jon
blazed
back.
“It’s
not
fair!”

“Fair?”
Dareon
sneered.
“The
girl
was
waiting
for
me,
naked
as
the
day
she
was
born.
She
pulled
me
through
the
window,
and
you
talk
to
me
of
fair?”
He
walked
off.

“There
is
no
shame
in
being
a
steward,”
Sam
said.

“Do
you
think
I
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
washing
an
old
man’s
smallclothes?”

“The
old
man
is
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Sam
reminded
him.
“You’ll
be
with
him
day
and
night.
Yes,
you’ll
pour
his
wine
and
see
that
his
bed
linen
is
fresh,
but
you’ll
also
take
his
letters,
attend
him
at
meetings,
squire
for
him
in
battle.
You’ll
be
as
close
to
him
as
his
shadow.
You’ll
know
everything,
be
a
part
of
everything…
and
the
Lord
Steward
said
Mormont
asked
for
you
himself!

“When
I
was
little,
my
father
used
to
insist
that
I
attend
him
in
the
audience
chamber
whenever
he
held
court.
When
he
rode
to
Highgarden
to
bend
his
knee
to
Lord
Tyrell,
he
made
me
come.
Later,
though,
he
started
to
take
Dickon
and
leave
me
at
home,
and
he
no
longer
cared
whether
I
sat
through
his
audiences,
so
long
as
Dickon
was
there.
He
wanted
his
heir
at
his
side,
don’t
you
see?
To
watch
and
listen
and
learn
from
all
he
did.
I’ll
wager
that’s
why
Lord
Mormont
requested
you,
Jon.
What
else
could
it
be?
He
wants
to
groom
you
for
command!”

Jon
was
taken
aback.
It
was
true,
Lord
Eddard
had
often
made
Robb
part
of
his
councils
back
at
Winterfell.
Could
Sam
be
right?
Even
a
bastard
could
rise
high
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
they
said.
“I
never
asked
for
this,”
he
said
stubbornly.

“None
of
us
are
here
for
asking,”
Sam
reminded
him.

And
suddenly
Jon
Snow
was
ashamed.

Craven
or
not,
Samwell
Tarly
had
found
the
courage
to
accept
his
fate
like
a
man.
On
the
Wall,
a
man
gets
only
what
he
earns,
Benjen
Stark
had
said
the
last
night
Jon
had
seen
him
alive.
You’re
no
ranger,
Jon,
only
a
green
boy
with
the
smell
of
summer
still
on
you.
He’d
heard
it
said
that
bastards
grow
up
faster
than
other
children;
on
the
Wall,
you
grew
up
or
you
died.

Jon
let
out
a
deep
sigh.
“You
have
the
right
of
it.
I
was
acting
the
boy.”

“Then
you’ll
stay
and
say
your
words
with
me?”

“The
old
gods
will
be
expecting
us.”
He
made
himself
smile.

They
set
out
late
that
afternoon.
The
Wall
had
no
gates
as
such,
neither
here
at
Castle
Black
nor
anywhere
along
its
three
hundred
miles.
They
led
their
horses
down
a
narrow
tunnel
cut
through
the
ice,
cold
dark
walls
pressing
in
around
them
as
the
passage
twisted
and
turned.
Three
times
their
way
was
blocked
by
iron
bars,
and
they
had
to
stop
while
Bowen
Marsh
drew
out
his
keys
and
unlocked
the
massive
chains
that
secured
them.
Jon
could
sense
the
vast
weight
pressing
down
on
him
as
he
waited
behind
the
Lord
Steward.
The
air
was
colder
than
a
tomb,
and
more
still.
He
felt
a
strange
relief
when
they
reemerged
into
the
afternoon
light
on
the
north
side
of
the
Wall.

Sam
blinked
at
the
sudden
glare
and
looked
around
apprehensively.
“The
wildlings…
they
wouldn’t…
they’d
never
dare
come
this
close
to
the
Wall.
Would
they?”

“They
never
have.”
Jon
climbed
into
his
saddle.
When
Bowen
Marsh
and
their
ranger
escort
had
mounted,
Jon
put
two
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
whistled.
Ghost
came
loping
out
of
the
tunnel.

The
Lord
Steward’s
garron
whickered
and
backed
away
from
the
direwolf.
“Do
you
mean
to
take
that
beast?”

“Yes,
my
lord,”
Jon
said.
Ghost’s
head
lifted.
He
seemed
to
taste
the
air.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye
he
was
off,
racing
across
the
broad,
weed-choked
field
to
vanish
in
the
trees.

Once
they
had
entered
the
forest,
they
were
in
a
different
world.
Jon
had
often
hunted
with
his
father
and
Jory
and
his
brother
Robb.
He
knew
the
wolfswood
around
Winterfell
as
well
as
any
man.
The
haunted
forest
was
much
the
same,
and
yet
the
feel
of
it
was
very
different.

Perhaps
it
was
all
in
the
knowing.
They
had
ridden
past
the
end
of
the
world;
somehow
that
changed
everything.
Every
shadow
seemed
darker,
every
sound
more
ominous.
The
trees
pressed
close
and
shut
out
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
A
thin
crust
of
snow
cracked
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
horses,
with
a
sound
like
breaking
bones.
When
the
wind
set
the
leaves
to
rustling,
it
was
like
a
chilly
finger
tracing
a
path
up
Jon’s
spine.
The
Wall
was
at
their
backs,
and
only
the
gods
knew
what
lay
ahead.

The
sun
was
sinking
below
the
trees
when
they
reached
their
destination,
a
small
clearing
in
the
deep
of
the
wood
where
nine
weirwoods
grew
in
a
rough
circle.
Jon
drew
in
a
breath,
and
he
saw
Sam
Tarly
staring.
Even
in
the
wolfswood,
you
never
found
more
than
two
or
three
of
the
white
trees
growing
together;
a
grove
of
nine
was
unheard
of.
The
forest
floor
was
carpeted
with
fallen
leaves,
bloodred
on
top,
black
rot
beneath.
The
wide
smooth
trunks
were
bone
pale,
and
nine
faces
stared
inward.
The
dried
sap
that
crusted
in
the
eyes
was
red
and
hard
as
ruby.
Bowen
Marsh
commanded
them
to
leave
their
horses
outside
the
circle.
“This
is
a
sacred
place,
we
will
not
defile
it.”

When
they
entered
the
grove,
Samwell
Tarly
turned
slowly
looking
at
each
face
in
turn.
No
two
were
quite
alike.
“They’re
watching
us,”
he
whispered.
“The
old
gods.”

“Yes.”
Jon
knelt,
and
Sam
knelt
beside
him.

They
said
the
words
together,
as
the
last
light
faded
in
the
west
and
grey
day
became
black
night.

“Hear
my
words,
and
bear
witness
to
my
vow,”
they
recited,
their
voices
filling
the
twilit
grove.
“Night
gathers,
and
now
my
watch
begins.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.
I
shall
take
no
wife,
hold
no
lands,
father
no
children.
I
shall
wear
no
crowns
and
win
no
glory.
I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post.
I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
I
am
the
watcher
on
the
walls.
I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.
I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
for
this
night
and
all
the
nights
to
come.”

The
woods
fell
silent.
“You
knelt
as
boys,”
Bowen
Marsh
intoned
solemnly.
“Rise
now
as
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Jon
held
out
a
hand
to
pull
Sam
back
to
his
feet.
The
rangers
gathered
round
to
offer
smiles
and
congratulations,
all
but
the
gnarled
old
forester
Dywen.
“Best
we
be
starting
back,
m’lord,”
he
said
to
Bowen
Marsh.
“Dark’s
falling,
and
there’s
something
in
the
smell
o’
the
night
that
I
mislike.”

And
suddenly
Ghost
was
back,
stalking
softly
between
two
weirwoods.
White
fur
and
red
eyes,
Jon
realized,
disquieted.
Like
the
trees…

The
wolf
had
something
in
his
jaws.
Something
black.
“What’s
he
got
there?”
asked
Bowen
Marsh,
frowning.

“To
me,
Ghost.”
Jon
knelt.
“Bring
it
here.”

The
direwolf
trotted
to
him.
Jon
heard
Samwell
Tarly’s
sharp
intake
of
breath.

“Gods
be
good,”
Dywen
muttered.
“That’s
a
hand.”





EDDARD

The
grey
light
of
dawn
was
streaming
through
his
window
when
the
thunder
of
hoofbeats
awoke
Eddard
Stark
from
his
brief,
exhausted
sleep.
He
lifted
his
head
from
the
table
to
look
down
into
the
yard.
Below,
men
in
mail
and
leather
and
crimson
cloaks
were
making
the
morning
ring
to
the
sound
of
swords,
and
riding
down
mock
warriors
stuffed
with
straw.
Ned
watched
Sandor
Clegane
gallop
across
the
hard-packed
ground
to
drive
an
iron-tipped
lance
through
a
dummy’s
head.
Canvas
ripped
and
straw
exploded
as
Lannister
guardsmen
joked
and
cursed.

Is
this
brave
show
for
my
benefit?
he
wondered.
If
so,
Cersei
was
a
greater
fool
than
he’d
imagined.
Damn
her,
he
thought,
why
is
the
woman
not
fled?
I
have
given
her
chance
after
chance…

The
morning
was
overcast
and
grim.
Ned
broke
his
fast
with
his
daughters
and
Septa
Mordane.
Sansa,
still
disconsolate,
stared
sullenly
at
her
food
and
refused
to
eat,
but
Arya
wolfed
down
everything
that
was
set
in
front
of
her.
“Syrio
says
we
have
time
for
one
last
lesson
before
we
take
ship
this
evening,”
she
said.
“Can
I,
Father?
All
my
things
are
packed.”

“A
short
lesson,
and
make
certain
you
leave
yourself
time
to
bathe
and
change.
I
want
you
ready
to
leave
by
midday,
is
that
understood?”

“By
midday,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
looked
up
from
her
food.
“If
she
can
have
a
dancing
lesson,
why
won’t
you
let
me
say
farewell
to
Prince
Joffrey?”

“I
would
gladly
go
with
her,
Lord
Eddard,”
Septa
Mordane
offered.
“There
would
be
no
question
of
her
missing
the
ship.”

“It
would
not
be
wise
for
you
to
go
to
Joffrey
right
now,
Sansa.
I’m
sorry.”

Sansa’s
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“But
why?”

“Sansa,
your
lord
father
knows
best,”
Septa
Mordane
said.
“You
are
not
to
question
his
decisions.”

“It’s
not
fair!”
Sansa
pushed
back
from
her
table,
knocked
over
her
chair,
and
ran
weeping
from
the
solar.

Septa
Mordane
rose,
but
Ned
gestured
her
back
to
her
seat.
“Let
her
go,
Septa.
I
will
try
to
make
her
understand
when
we
are
all
safely
back
in
Winterfell.”
The
septa
bowed
her
head
and
sat
down
to
finish
her
breakfast.

It
was
an
hour
later
when
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
to
Eddard
Stark
in
his
solar.
His
shoulders
slumped,
as
if
the
weight
of
the
great
maester’s
chain
around
his
neck
had
become
too
great
to
bear.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“King
Robert
is
gone.
The
gods
give
him
rest.”

“No,”
Ned
answered.
“He
hated
rest.
The
gods
give
him
love
and
laughter,
and
the
joy
of
righteous
battle.”
It
was
strange
how
empty
he
felt.
He
had
been
expecting
the
visit,
and
yet
with
those
words,
something
died
within
him.
He
would
have
given
all
his
titles
for
the
freedom
to
weep…
but
he
was
Robert’s
Hand,
and
the
hour
he
dreaded
had
come.
“Be
so
good
as
to
summon
the
members
of
the
council
here
to
my
solar,”
he
told
Pycelle.
The
Tower
of
the
Hand
was
as
secure
as
he
and
Tomard
could
make
it;
he
could
not
say
the
same
for
the
council
chambers.

“My
lord?”
Pycelle
blinked.
“Surely
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
will
keep
till
the
morrow,
when
our
grief
is
not
so
fresh.”

Ned
was
quiet
but
firm.
“I
fear
we
must
convene
at
once.”

Pycelle
bowed.
“As
the
Hand
commands.”
He
called
his
servants
and
sent
them
running,
then
gratefully
accepted
Ned’s
offer
of
a
chair
and
a
cup
of
sweet
beer.

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
was
the
first
to
answer
the
summons,
immaculate
in
white
cloak
and
enameled
scales.
“My
lords,”
he
said,
“my
place
is
beside
the
young
king
now.
Pray
give
me
leave
to
attend
him.”

“Your
place
is
here,
Ser
Barristan,”
Ned
told
him.

Littlefinger
came
next,
still
garbed
in
the
blue
velvets
and
silver
mockingbird
cape
he
had
worn
the
night
previous,
his
boots
dusty
from
riding.
“My
lords,”
he
said,
smiling
at
nothing
in
particular
before
he
turned
to
Ned.
“That
little
task
you
set
me
is
accomplished,
Lord
Eddard.”

Varys
entered
in
a
wash
of
lavender,
pink
from
his
bath,
his
plump
face
scrubbed
and
freshly
powdered,
his
soft
slippers
all
but
soundless.
“The
little
birds
sing
a
grievous
song
today,”
he
said
as
he
seated
himself.
“The
realm
weeps.
Shall
we
begin?”

“When
Lord
Renly
arrives,”
Ned
said.

Varys
gave
him
a
sorrowful
look.
“I
fear
Lord
Renly
has
left
the
city.”

“Left
the
city?”
Ned
had
counted
on
Renly’s
support.

“He
took
his
leave
through
a
postern
gate
an
hour
before
dawn,
accompanied
by
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
some
fifty
retainers,”
Varys
told
them.
“When
last
seen,
they
were
galloping
south
in
some
haste,
no
doubt
bound
for
Storm’s
End
or
Highgarden.”

So
much
for
Renly
and
his
hundred
swords.
Ned
did
not
like
the
smell
of
that,
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it.
He
drew
out
Robert’s
last
letter.
“The
king
called
me
to
his
side
last
night
and
commanded
me
to
record
his
final
words.
Lord
Renly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stood
witness
as
Robert
sealed
the
letter,
to
be
opened
by
the
council
after
his
death.
Ser
Barristan,
if
you
would
be
so
kind?”

The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
examined
the
paper.
“King
Robert’s
seal,
and
unbroken.”
He
opened
the
letter
and
read.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
herein
named
Protector
of
the
Realm,
to
rule
as
regent
until
the
heir
comes
of
age.”

And
as
it
happens,
he
is
of
age,
Ned
reflected,
but
he
did
not
give
voice
to
the
thought.
He
trusted
neither
Pycelle
nor
Varys,
and
Ser
Barristan
was
honor-bound
to
protect
and
defend
the
boy
he
thought
his
new
king.
The
old
knight
would
not
abandon
Joffrey
easily.
The
need
for
deceit
was
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth,
but
Ned
knew
he
must
tread
softly
here,
must
keep
his
counsel
and
play
the
game
until
he
was
firmly
established
as
regent.
There
would
be
time
enough
to
deal
with
the
succession
when
Arya
and
Sansa
were
safely
back
in
Winterfell,
and
Lord
Stannis
had
returned
to
King’s
Landing
with
all
his
power.

“I
would
ask
this
council
to
confirm
me
as
Lord
Protector,
as
Robert
wished,”
Ned
said,
watching
their
faces,
wondering
what
thoughts
hid
behind
Pycelle’s
half-closed
eyes,
Littlefinger’s
lazy
half-smile,
and
the
nervous
flutter
of
Varys’s
fingers.

The
door
opened.
Fat
Tom
stepped
into
the
solar.
“Pardon,
my
lords,
the
king’s
steward
insists…”

The
royal
steward
entered
and
bowed.
“Esteemed
lords,
the
king
demands
the
immediate
presence
of
his
small
council
in
the
throne
room.”

Ned
had
expected
Cersei
to
strike
quickly;
the
summons
came
as
no
surprise.
“The
king
is
dead,”
he
said,
“but
we
shall
go
with
you
nonetheless.
Tom,
assemble
an
escort,
if
you
would.”

Littlefinger
gave
Ned
his
arm
to
help
him
down
the
steps.
Varys,
Pycelle,
and
Ser
Barristan
followed
close
behind.
A
double
column
of
men-at-arms
in
chainmail
and
steel
helms
was
waiting
outside
the
tower,
eight
strong.
Grey
cloaks
snapped
in
the
wind
as
the
guardsmen
marched
them
across
the
yard.
There
was
no
Lannister
crimson
to
be
seen,
but
Ned
was
reassured
by
the
number
of
gold
cloaks
visible
on
the
ramparts
and
at
the
gates.

Janos
Slynt
met
them
at
the
door
to
the
throne
room,
armored
in
ornate
black-and-gold
plate,
with
a
high-crested
helm
under
one
arm.
The
Commander
bowed
stiffly.
His
men
pushed
open
the
great
oaken
doors,
twenty
feet
tall
and
banded
with
bronze.

The
royal
steward
led
them
in.
“All
hail
His
Grace,
Joffrey
of
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,”
he
sang
out.

It
was
a
long
walk
to
the
far
end
of
the
hall,
where
Joffrey
waited
atop
the
Iron
Throne.
Supported
by
Littlefinger,
Ned
Stark
slowly
limped
and
hopped
toward
the
boy
who
called
himself
king.
The
others
followed.
The
first
time
he
had
come
this
way,
he
had
been
on
horseback,
sword
in
hand,
and
the
Targaryen
dragons
had
watched
from
the
walls
as
he
forced
Jaime
Lannister
down
from
the
throne.
He
wondered
if
Joffrey
would
step
down
quite
so
easily.

Five
knights
of
the
Kingsguard—all
but
Ser
Jaime
and
Ser
Barristan—were
arrayed
in
a
crescent
around
the
base
of
the
throne.
They
were
in
full
armor,
enameled
steel
from
helm
to
heel,
long
pale
cloaks
over
their
shoulders,
shining
white
shields
strapped
to
their
left
arms.
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
two
younger
children
stood
behind
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn.
The
queen
wore
a
gown
of
sea-green
silk,
trimmed
with
Myrish
lace
as
pale
as
foam.
On
her
finger
was
a
golden
ring
with
an
emerald
the
size
of
a
pigeon’s
egg,
on
her
head
a
matching
tiara.

Above
them,
Prince
Joffrey
sat
amidst
the
barbs
and
spikes
in
a
cloth-of-gold
doublet
and
a
red
satin
cape.
Sandor
Clegane
was
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
throne’s
steep
narrow
stair.
He
wore
mail
and
soot-grey
plate
and
his
snarling
dog’s-head
helm.

Behind
the
throne,
twenty
Lannister
guardsmen
waited
with
longswords
hanging
from
their
belts.
Crimson
cloaks
draped
their
shoulders
and
steel
lions
crested
their
helms.
But
Littlefinger
had
kept
his
promise;
all
along
the
walls,
in
front
of
Robert’s
tapestries
with
their
scenes
of
hunt
and
battle,
the
gold-cloaked
ranks
of
the
City
Watch
stood
stiffly
to
attention,
each
man’s
hand
clasped
around
the
haft
of
an
eight-foot-long
spear
tipped
in
black
iron.
They
outnumbered
the
Lannisters
five
to
one.

Ned’s
leg
was
a
blaze
of
pain
by
the
time
he
stopped.
He
kept
a
hand
on
Littlefinger’s
shoulder
to
help
support
his
weight.

Joffrey
stood.
His
red
satin
cape
was
patterned
in
gold
thread;
fifty
roaring
lions
to
one
side,
fifty
prancing
stags
to
the
other.
“I
command
the
council
to
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
my
coronation,”
the
boy
proclaimed.
“I
wish
to
be
crowned
within
the
fortnight.
Today
I
shall
accept
oaths
of
fealty
from
my
loyal
councillors.”

Ned
produced
Robert’s
letter.
“Lord
Varys,
be
so
kind
as
to
show
this
to
my
lady
of
Lannister.”

The
eunuch
carried
the
letter
to
Cersei.
The
queen
glanced
at
the
words.
“Protector
of
the
Realm,”
she
read.
“Is
this
meant
to
be
your
shield,
my
lord?
A
piece
of
paper?”
She
ripped
the
letter
in
half,
ripped
the
halves
in
quarters,
and
let
the
pieces
flutter
to
the
floor.

“Those
were
the
king’s
words,”
Ser
Barristan
said,
shocked.

“We
have
a
new
king
now,”
Cersei
Lannister
replied.
“Lord
Eddard,
when
last
we
spoke,
you
gave
me
some
counsel.
Allow
me
to
return
the
courtesy.
Bend
the
knee,
my
lord.
Bend
the
knee
and
swear
fealty
to
my
son,
and
we
shall
allow
you
to
step
down
as
Hand
and
live
out
your
days
in
the
grey
waste
you
call
home.”

“Would
that
I
could,”
Ned
said
grimly.
If
she
was
so
determined
to
force
the
issue
here
and
now,
she
left
him
no
choice.
“Your
son
has
no
claim
to
the
throne
he
sits.
Lord
Stannis
is
Robert’s
true
heir.”

“Liar!”
Joffrey
screamed,
his
face
reddening.

“Mother,
what
does
he
mean?”
Princess
Myrcella
asked
the
queen
plaintively.
“Isn’t
Joff
the
king
now?”

“You
condemn
yourself
with
your
own
mouth,
Lord
Stark,”
said
Cersei
Lannister.
“Ser
Barristan,
seize
this
traitor.”

The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
hesitated.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye
he
was
surrounded
by
Stark
guardsmen,
bare
steel
in
their
mailed
fists.

“And
now
the
treason
moves
from
words
to
deeds,”
Cersei
said.
“Do
you
think
Ser
Barristan
stands
alone,
my
lord?”
With
an
ominous
rasp
of
metal
on
metal,
the
Hound
drew
his
longsword.
The
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
and
twenty
Lannister
guardsmen
in
crimson
cloaks
moved
to
support
him.

“Kill
him!”
the
boy
king
screamed
down
from
the
Iron
Throne.
“Kill
all
of
them,
I
command
it!”

“You
leave
me
no
choice,”
Ned
told
Cersei
Lannister.
He
called
out
to
Janos
Slynt.
“Commander,
take
the
queen
and
her
children
into
custody.
Do
them
no
harm,
but
escort
them
back
to
the
royal
apartments
and
keep
them
there,
under
guard.”

“Men
of
the
Watch!”
Janos
Slynt
shouted,
donning
his
helm.
A
hundred
gold
cloaks
leveled
their
spears
and
closed.

“I
want
no
bloodshed,”
Ned
told
the
queen.
“Tell
your
men
to
lay
down
their
swords,
and
no
one
need—”

With
a
single
sharp
thrust,
the
nearest
gold
cloak
drove
his
spear
into
Tomard’s
back.
Fat
Tom’s
blade
dropped
from
nerveless
fingers
as
the
wet
red
point
burst
out
through
his
ribs,
piercing
leather
and
mail.
He
was
dead
before
his
sword
hit
the
floor.

Ned’s
shout
came
far
too
late.
Janos
Slynt
himself
slashed
open
Varly’s
throat.
Cayn
whirled,
steel
flashing,
drove
back
the
nearest
spearman
with
a
flurry
of
blows;
for
an
instant
it
looked
as
though
he
might
cut
his
way
free.
Then
the
Hound
was
on
him.
Sandor
Clegane’s
first
cut
took
off
Cayn’s
sword
hand
at
the
wrist;
his
second
drove
him
to
his
knees
and
opened
him
from
shoulder
to
breastbone.

As
his
men
died
around
him,
Littlefinger
slid
Ned’s
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
shoved
it
up
under
his
chin.
His
smile
was
apologetic.
“I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me,
you
know.”





ARYA

“High,”
Syrio
Forel
called
out,
slashing
at
her
head.
The
stick
swords
clacked
as
Arya
parried.

“Left,”
he
shouted,
and
his
blade
came
whistling.
Hers
darted
to
meet
it.
The
clack
made
him
click
his
teeth
together.

“Right,”
he
said,
and
“Low,”
and
“Left,”
and
“Left”
again,
faster
and
faster,
moving
forward.
Arya
retreated
before
him,
checking
each
blow.

“Lunge,”
he
warned,
and
when
he
thrust
she
sidestepped,
swept
his
blade
away,
and
slashed
at
his
shoulder.
She
almost
touched
him,
almost,
so
close
it
made
her
grin.
A
strand
of
hair
dangled
in
her
eyes,
limp
with
sweat.
She
pushed
it
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand.

“Left,”
Syrio
sang
out.
“Low.”
His
sword
was
a
blur,
and
the
Small
Hall
echoed
to
the
clack
clack
clack.
“Left.
Left.
High.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Low.
Left!”

The
wooden
blade
caught
her
high
in
the
breast,
a
sudden
stinging
blow
that
hurt
all
the
more
because
it
came
from
the
wrong
side.
“Ow,”
she
cried
out.
She
would
have
a
fresh
bruise
there
by
the
time
she
went
to
sleep,
somewhere
out
at
sea.
A
bruise
is
a
lesson,
she
told
herself,
and
each
lesson
makes
us
better.

Syrio
stepped
back.
“You
are
dead
now.”

Arya
made
a
face.
“You
cheated,”
she
said
hotly.
“You
said
left
and
you
went
right.”

“Just
so.
And
now
you
are
a
dead
girl.”

“But
you
lied!”

“My
words
lied.
My
eyes
and
my
arm
shouted
out
the
truth,
but
you
were
not
seeing.”

“I
was
so,”
Arya
said.
“I
watched
you
every
second!”

“Watching
is
not
seeing,
dead
girl.
The
water
dancer
sees.
Come,
put
down
the
sword,
it
is
time
for
listening
now.”

She
followed
him
over
to
the
wall,
where
he
settled
onto
a
bench.
“Syrio
Forel
was
first
sword
to
the
Sealord
of
Braavos,
and
are
you
knowing
how
that
came
to
pass?”

“You
were
the
finest
swordsman
in
the
city.”

“Just
so,
but
why?
Other
men
were
stronger,
faster,
younger,
why
was
Syrio
Forel
the
best?
I
will
tell
you
now.”
He
touched
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
lightly
to
his
eyelid.
“The
seeing,
the
true
seeing,
that
is
the
heart
of
it.

“Hear
me.
The
ships
of
Braavos
sail
as
far
as
the
winds
blow,
to
lands
strange
and
wonderful,
and
when
they
return
their
captains
fetch
queer
animals
to
the
Sealord’s
menagerie.
Such
animals
as
you
have
never
seen,
striped
horses,
great
spotted
things
with
necks
as
long
as
stilts,
hairy
mouse-pigs
as
big
as
cows,
stinging
manticores,
tigers
that
carry
their
cubs
in
a
pouch,
terrible
walking
lizards
with
scythes
for
claws.
Syrio
Forel
has
seen
these
things.

“On
the
day
I
am
speaking
of,
the
first
sword
was
newly
dead,
and
the
Sealord
sent
for
me.
Many
bravos
had
come
to
him,
and
as
many
had
been
sent
away,
none
could
say
why.
When
I
came
into
his
presence,
he
was
seated,
and
in
his
lap
was
a
fat
yellow
cat.
He
told
me
that
one
of
his
captains
had
brought
the
beast
to
him,
from
an
island
beyond
the
sunrise.
‘Have
you
ever
seen
her
like?’
he
asked
of
me.

“And
to
him
I
said,
‘Each
night
in
the
alleys
of
Braavos
I
see
a
thousand
like
him,’
and
the
Sealord
laughed,
and
that
day
I
was
named
the
first
sword.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face.
“I
don’t
understand.”

Syrio
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“The
cat
was
an
ordinary
cat,
no
more.
The
others
expected
a
fabulous
beast,
so
that
is
what
they
saw.
How
large
it
was,
they
said.
It
was
no
larger
than
any
other
cat,
only
fat
from
indolence,
for
the
Sealord
fed
it
from
his
own
table.
What
curious
small
ears,
they
said.
Its
ears
had
been
chewed
away
in
kitten
fights.
And
it
was
plainly
a
tomcat,
yet
the
Sealord
said
‘her,’
and
that
is
what
the
others
saw.
Are
you
hearing?”

Arya
thought
about
it.
“You
saw
what
was
there.”

“Just
so.
Opening
your
eyes
is
all
that
is
needing.
The
heart
lies
and
the
head
plays
tricks
with
us,
but
the
eyes
see
true.
Look
with
your
eyes.
Hear
with
your
ears.
Taste
with
your
mouth.
Smell
with
your
nose.
Feel
with
your
skin.
Then
comes
the
thinking,
afterward,
and
in
that
way
knowing
the
truth.”

“Just
so,”
said
Arya,
grinning.

Syrio
Forel
allowed
himself
a
smile.
“I
am
thinking
that
when
we
are
reaching
this
Winterfell
of
yours,
it
will
be
time
to
put
this
needle
in
your
hand.”

“Yes!”
Arya
said
eagerly.
“Wait
till
I
show
Jon—”

Behind
her
the
great
wooden
doors
of
the
Small
Hall
flew
open
with
a
resounding
crash.
Arya
whirled.

A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
stood
beneath
the
arch
of
the
door
with
five
Lannister
guardsmen
arrayed
behind
him.
He
was
in
full
armor,
but
his
visor
was
up.
Arya
remembered
his
droopy
eyes
and
rustcolored
whiskers
from
when
he
had
come
to
Winterfell
with
the
king:
Ser
Meryn
Trant.
The
red
cloaks
wore
mail
shirts
over
boiled
leather
and
steel
caps
with
lion
crests.
“Arya
Stark,”
the
knight
said,
“come
with
us,
child.”

Arya
chewed
her
lip
uncertainly.
“What
do
you
want?”

“Your
father
wants
to
see
you.”

Arya
took
a
step
forward,
but
Syrio
Forel
held
her
by
the
arm.
“And
why
is
it
that
Lord
Eddard
is
sending
Lannister
men
in
the
place
of
his
own?
I
am
wondering.”

“Mind
your
place,
dancing
master,”
Ser
Meryn
said.
“This
is
no
concern
of
yours.”

“My
father
wouldn’t
send
you,”
Arya
said.
She
snatched
up
her
stick
sword.
The
Lannisters
laughed.

“Put
down
the
stick,
girl,”
Ser
Meryn
told
her.
“I
am
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Kingsguard,
the
White
Swords.”

“So
was
the
Kingslayer
when
he
killed
the
old
king,”
Arya
said.
“I
don’t
have
to
go
with
you
if
I
don’t
want.”

Ser
Meryn
Trant
ran
out
of
patience.
“Take
her,”
he
said
to
his
men.
He
lowered
the
visor
of
his
helm.

Three
of
them
started
forward,
chainmail
clinking
softly
with
each
step.
Arya
was
suddenly
afraid.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
told
herself,
to
slow
the
racing
of
her
heart.

Syrio
Forel
stepped
between
them,
tapping
his
wooden
sword
lightly
against
his
boot.
“You
will
be
stopping
there.
Are
you
men
or
dogs
that
you
would
threaten
a
child?”

“Out
of
the
way,
old
man,”
one
of
the
red
cloaks
said.

Syrio’s
stick
came
whistling
up
and
rang
against
his
helm.
“I
am
Syrio
Forel,
and
you
will
now
be
speaking
to
me
with
more
respect.”

“Bald
bastard.”
The
man
yanked
free
his
longsword.
The
stick
moved
again,
blindingly
fast.
Arya
heard
a
loud
crack
as
the
sword
went
clattering
to
the
stone
floor.
“My
hand,”
the
guardsman
yelped,
cradling
his
broken
fingers.

“You
are
quick,
for
a
dancing
master,”
said
Ser
Meryn.

“You
are
slow,
for
a
knight,”
Syrio
replied.

“Kill
the
Braavosi
and
bring
me
the
girl,”
the
knight
in
the
white
armor
commanded.

Four
Lannister
guardsmen
unsheathed
their
swords.
The
fifth,
with
the
broken
fingers,
spat
and
pulled
free
a
dagger
with
his
left
hand.

Syrio
Forel
clicked
his
teeth
together,
sliding
into
his
water
dancer’s
stance,
presenting
only
his
side
to
the
foe.
“Arya
child,”
he
called
out,
never
looking,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
Lannisters,
“we
are
done
with
dancing
for
the
day.
Best
you
are
going
now.
Run
to
your
father.”

Arya
did
not
want
to
leave
him,
but
he
had
taught
her
to
do
as
he
said.
“Swift
as
a
deer,”
she
whispered.

“Just
so,”
said
Syrio
Forel
as
the
Lannisters
closed.

Arya
retreated,
her
own
sword
stick
clutched
tightly
in
her
hand.
Watching
him
now,
she
realized
that
Syrio
had
only
been
toying
with
her
when
they
dueled.
The
red
cloaks
came
at
him
from
three
sides
with
steel
in
their
hands.
They
had
chainmail
over
their
chest
and
arms,
and
steel
codpieces
sewn
into
their
pants,
but
only
leather
on
their
legs.
Their
hands
were
bare,
and
the
caps
they
wore
had
noseguards,
but
no
visor
over
the
eyes.

Syrio
did
not
wait
for
them
to
reach
him,
but
spun
to
his
left.
Arya
had
never
seen
a
man
move
as
fast.
He
checked
one
sword
with
his
stick
and
whirled
away
from
a
second.
Off
balance,
the
second
man
lurched
into
the
first.
Syrio
put
a
boot
to
his
back
and
the
red
cloaks
went
down
together.
The
third
guard
came
leaping
over
them,
slashing
at
the
water
dancer’s
head.
Syrio
ducked
under
his
blade
and
thrust
upward.
The
guardsman
fell
screaming
as
blood
welled
from
the
wet
red
hole
where
his
left
eye
had
been.

The
fallen
men
were
getting
up.
Syrio
kicked
one
in
the
face
and
snatched
the
steel
cap
off
the
other’s
head.
The
dagger
man
stabbed
at
him.
Syrio
caught
the
thrust
in
the
helmet
and
shattered
the
man’s
kneecap
with
his
stick.
The
last
red
cloak
shouted
a
curse
and
charged,
hacking
down
with
both
hands
on
his
sword.
Syrio
rolled
right,
and
the
butcher’s
cut
caught
the
helmetless
man
between
neck
and
shoulder
as
he
struggled
to
his
knees.
The
longsword
crunched
through
mail
and
leather
and
flesh.
The
man
on
his
knees
shrieked.
Before
his
killer
could
wrench
free
his
blade,
Syrio
jabbed
him
in
the
apple
of
his
throat.
The
guardsman
gave
a
choked
cry
and
staggered
back,
clutching
at
his
neck,
his
face
blackening.

Five
men
were
down,
dead,
or
dying
by
the
time
Arya
reached
the
back
door
that
opened
on
the
kitchen.
She
heard
Ser
Meryn
Trant
curse.
“Bloody
oafs,”
he
swore,
drawing
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.

Syrio
Forel
resumed
his
stance
and
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“Arya
child,”
he
called
out,
never
looking
at
her,
“be
gone
now.”

Look
with
your
eyes,
he
had
said.
She
saw:
the
knight
in
his
pale
armor
head
to
foot,
legs,
throat,
and
hands
sheathed
in
metal,
eyes
hidden
behind
his
high
white
helm,
and
in
his
hand
cruel
steel.
Against
that:
Syrio,
in
a
leather
vest,
with
a
wooden
sword
in
his
hand.
“Syrio,
run,”
she
screamed.

“The
first
sword
of
Braavos
does
not
run,”
he
sang
as
Ser
Meryn
slashed
at
him.
Syrio
danced
away
from
his
cut,
his
stick
a
blur.
In
a
heartbeat,
he
had
bounced
blows
off
the
knight’s
temple,
elbow,
and
throat,
the
wood
ringing
against
the
metal
of
helm,
gauntlet,
and
gorget.
Arya
stood
frozen.
Ser
Meryn
advanced;
Syrio
backed
away.
He
checked
the
next
blow,
spun
away
from
the
second,
deflected
the
third.

The
fourth
sliced
his
stick
in
two,
splintering
the
wood
and
shearing
through
the
lead
core.

Sobbing,
Arya
spun
and
ran.

She
plunged
through
the
kitchens
and
buttery,
blind
with
panic,
weaving
between
cooks
and
potboys.
A
baker’s
helper
stepped
in
front
of
her,
holding
a
wooden
tray.
Arya
bowled
her
over,
scattering
fragrant
loaves
of
fresh-baked
bread
on
the
floor.
She
heard
shouting
behind
her
as
she
spun
around
a
portly
butcher
who
stood
gaping
at
her
with
a
cleaver
in
his
hands.
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow.

All
that
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her
went
racing
through
her
head.
Swift
as
a
deer.
Quiet
as
a
shadow.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Quick
as
a
snake.
Calm
as
still
water.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Strong
as
a
bear.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
The
man
who
fears
losing
has
already
lost.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
The
grip
of
her
wooden
sword
was
slick
with
sweat,
and
Arya
was
breathing
hard
when
she
reached
the
turret
stair.
For
an
instant
she
froze.
Up
or
down?
Up
would
take
her
to
the
covered
bridge
that
spanned
the
small
court
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
that
would
be
the
way
they’d
expect
her
to
go,
for
certain.
Never
do
what
they
expect,
Syrio
once
said.
Arya
went
down,
around
and
around,
leaping
over
the
narrow
stone
steps
two
and
three
at
a
time.
She
emerged
in
a
cavernous
vaulted
cellar,
surrounded
by
casks
of
ale
stacked
twenty
feet
tall.
The
only
light
came
through
narrow
slanting
windows
high
in
the
wall.

The
cellar
was
a
dead
end.
There
was
no
way
out
but
the
way
she
had
come
in.
She
dare
not
go
back
up
those
steps,
but
she
couldn’t
stay
here,
either.
She
had
to
find
her
father
and
tell
him
what
had
happened.
Her
father
would
protect
her.

Arya
thrust
her
wooden
sword
through
her
belt
and
began
to
climb,
leaping
from
cask
to
cask
until
she
could
reach
the
window.
Grasping
the
stone
with
both
hands,
she
pulled
herself
up.
The
wall
was
three
feet
thick,
the
window
a
tunnel
slanting
up
and
out.
Arya
wriggled
toward
daylight.
When
her
head
reached
ground
level,
she
peered
across
the
bailey
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

The
stout
wooden
door
hung
splintered
and
broken,
as
if
by
axes.
A
dead
man
sprawled
facedown
on
the
steps,
his
cloak
tangled
beneath
him,
the
back
of
his
mailed
shirt
soaked
red.
The
corpse’s
cloak
was
grey
wool
trimmed
with
white
satin,
she
saw
with
sudden
terror.
She
could
not
tell
who
he
was.

“No,”
she
whispered.
What
was
happening?
Where
was
her
father?
Why
had
the
red
cloaks
come
for
her?
She
remembered
what
the
man
with
the
yellow
beard
had
said,
the
day
she
had
found
the
monsters.
If
one
Hand
can
die,
why
not
a
second?
Arya
felt
tears
in
her
eyes.
She
held
her
breath
to
listen.
She
heard
the
sounds
of
fighting,
shouts,
screams,
the
clang
of
steel
on
steel,
coming
through
the
windows
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

She
could
not
go
back.
Her
father…

Arya
closed
her
eyes.
For
a
moment
she
was
too
frightened
to
move.
They
had
killed
Jory
and
Wyl
and
Heward,
and
that
guardsman
on
the
step,
whoever
he
had
been.
They
could
kill
her
father
too,
and
her
if
they
caught
her.
“Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,”
she
said
aloud,
but
it
was
no
good
pretending
to
be
a
water
dancer,
Syrio
had
been
>>>>>>> asd
a
water
dancer
and
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
a
wolf
and
not
afraid
again,
ever.

Was
that
enough?
Maybe
she
should
pray
aloud
if
she
wanted
the
old
gods
to
hear.
Maybe
she
should
pray
longer.
Sometimes
her
father
had
prayed
a
long
time,
she
remembered.
But
the
old
gods
had
never
helped
him.
Remembering
that
made
her
angry.
“You
should
have
saved
him,”
she
scolded
the
tree.
“He
prayed
to
you
all
the
time.
I
don’t
care
if
you
help
me
or
not.
I
don’t
think
you
could
even
if
you
wanted
to.”

“Gods
are
not
mocked,
girl.”

The
voice
startled
her.
She
leapt
to
her
feet
and
drew
her
wooden
sword.
Jaqen
H’ghar
stood
so
still
in
the
darkness
that
he
seemed
one
of
the
trees.
“A
man
comes
to
hear
a
name.
One
and
two
and
then
comes
three.
A
man
would
have
done.”

Arya
lowered
the
splintery
point
toward
the
ground.
“How
did
you
know
I
was
here?”

“A
man
sees.
A
man
hears.
A
man
knows.”

She
regarded
him
suspiciously.
Had
the
gods
sent
him?
“How’d
you
make
the
dog
kill
Weese?
Did
you
call
Rorge
and
Biter
up
from
hell?
Is
Jaqen
H’ghar
your
true
name?”

“Some
men
have
many
names.
Weasel.
Arry.
Arya.”

She
backed
away
from
him,
until
she
was
pressed
against
the
heart
tree.
“Did
Gendry
tell?”

“A
man
knows,”
he
said
again.
“My
lady
of
Stark.”

Maybe
the
gods
had
sent
him
in
answer
to
her
prayers.
“I
need
you
to
help
me
get
those
men
out
of
the
dungeons.
That
Glover
and
those
others,
all
of
them.
We
have
to
kill
the
guards
and
open
the
cell
somehow—”

“A
girl
forgets,”
he
said
quietly.
“Two
she
has
had,
three
were
owed.
If
a
guard
must
die,
she
needs
only
speak
his
name.”

“But
one
guard
won’t
be
enough,
we
need
to
kill
them
all
to
open
the
cell.”
Arya
bit
her
lip
hard
to
stop
from
crying.
“I
want
you
to
save
the
northmen
like
I
saved
you.”

He
looked
down
at
her
pitilessly.
“Three
lives
were
snatched
from
a
god.
Three
lives
must
be
repaid.
The
gods
are
not
mocked.”
His
voice
was
silk
and
steel.

“I
never
mocked.”
She
thought
for
a
moment.
“The
name…
can
I
name
anyone?
And
you’ll
kill
him?”

Jaqen
H’ghar
inclined
his
head.
“A
man
has
said.”

“Anyone?”
she
repeated.
“A
man,
a
woman,
a
little
baby,
or
Lord
Tywin,
or
the
High
Septon,
or
your
father?”

“A
man’s
sire
is
long
dead,
but
did
he
live,
and
did
you
know
his
name,
he
would
die
at
your
command.”

“Swear
it,”
Arya
said.
“Swear
it
by
the
gods.”

“By
all
the
gods
of
sea
and
air,
and
even
him
of
fire,
I
swear
it.”
He
placed
a
hand
in
the
mouth
of
the
weirwood.
“By
the
seven
new
gods
and
the
old
gods
beyond
count,
I
swear
it.”

He
has
sworn.
“Even
if
I
named
the
king…”

“Speak
the
name,
and
death
will
come.
On
the
morrow,
at
the
turn
of
the
moon,
a
year
from
this
day,
it
will
come.
A
man
does
not
fly
like
a
bird,
but
one
foot
moves
and
then
another
and
one
day
a
man
is
there,
and
a
king
dies.”
He
knelt
beside
her,
so
they
were
face-to-face,
“A
girl
whispers
if
she
fears
to
speak
aloud.
Whisper
it
now.
Is
it
Joffrey?”

Arya
put
her
lips
to
his
ear.
“It’s
Jaqen
H’ghar.”

Even
in
the
burning
barn,
with
walls
of
flame
towering
all
around
and
him
in
chains,
he
had
not
seemed
so
distraught
as
he
did
now.
“A
girl…
she
makes
a
jest.”

“You
swore.
The
gods
heard
you
swear.”

“The
gods
did
hear,”
There
was
a
knife
in
his
hand
suddenly,
its
blade
thin
as
her
little
finger.
Whether
it
was
meant
for
her
or
him,
Arya
could
not
say.
“A
girl
will
weep.
A
girl
will
lose
her
only
friend.”

“You’re
not
my
friend.
A
friend
would
help
me.”
She
stepped
away
from
him,
balanced
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
in
case
he
threw
his
knife.
“I’d
never
kill
a
friend.”

Jaqen’s
smile
came
and
went.
“A
girl
might…
name
another
name
then,
if
a
friend
did
help?”

“A
girl
might,”
she
said.
“If
a
friend
did
help.”

The
knife
vanished.
“Come.”

“Now?”
She
had
never
thought
he
would
act
so
quickly.

“A
man
hears
the
whisper
of
sand
in
a
glass.
A
man
will
not
sleep
until
a
girl
unsays
a
certain
name.
Now,
evil
child.”

I’m
not
an
evil
child,
she
thought,
I
am
a
direwolf,
and
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal.
She
put
her
broomstick
back
in
its
hiding
place
and
followed
him
from
the
godswood.

Despite
the
hour,
Harrenhal
stirred
with
fitful
life.
Vargo
Hoat’s
arrival
had
thrown
off
all
the
routines.
Ox
carts,
oxen,
and
horses
had
all
vanished
from
the
yard,
but
the
bear
cage
was
still
there.
It
had
been
hung
from
the
arched
span
of
the
bridge
that
divided
the
outer
and
middle
wards,
suspended
on
heavy
chains,
a
few
feet
off
the
ground.
A
ring
of
torches
bathed
the
area
in
light.
Some
of
the
boys
from
the
stables
were
tossing
stones
to
make
the
bear
roar
and
grumble.
Across
the
ward,
light
spilled
through
the
door
of
the
Barracks
Hall,
accompanied
by
the
clatter
of
tankards
and
men
calling
for
more
wine.
A
dozen
voices
took
up
a
song
in
a
guttural
tongue
strange
to
Arya’s
ears.

They’re
drinking
and
eating
before
they
sleep,
she
realized.
Pinkeye
would
have
sent
to
wake
me,
to
help
with
the
serving.
He’ll
know
I’m
not
abed.
But
likely
he
was
busy
pouring
for
the
Brave
Companions
and
those
of
Ser
Amory’s
garrison
who
had
joined
them.
The
noise
they
were
making
would
be
a
good
distraction.

“The
hungry
gods
will
feast
on
blood
tonight,
if
a
man
would
do
this
thing,”
Jaqen
said.
“Sweet
girl,
kind
and
gentle.
Unsay
one
name
and
say
another
and
cast
this
mad
dream
aside.”

“I
won’t.”

“Just
so.”
He
seemed
resigned.
“The
thing
will
be
done,
but
a
girl
must
obey.
A
man
has
no
time
for
talk.”

“A
girl
will
obey,”
Arya
said.
“What
should
I
do?”

“A
hundred
men
are
hungry,
they
must
be
fed,
the
lord
commands
hot
broth.
A
girl
must
run
to
the
kitchens
and
tell
her
pie
boy.”

“Broth,”
she
repeated.
“Where
will
you
be?”

“A
girl
will
help
make
broth,
and
wait
in
the
kitchens
until
a
man
comes
for
her.
Go.
Run.”

Hot
Pie
was
pulling
his
loaves
from
the
ovens
when
she
burst
into
the
kitchen,
but
he
was
no
longer
alone.
They’d
woken
the
cooks
to
feed
Vargo
Hoat
and
his
Bloody
Mummers.
Serving
men
were
carrying
off
baskets
of
Hot
Pie’s
bread
and
tarts,
the
chief
cook
was
carving
cold
slices
off
a
ham,
spit
boys
were
turning
rabbits
while
the
pot
girls
basted
them
with
honey,
women
were
chopping
onions
and
carrots.
“What
do
you
want,
Weasel?”
the
chief
cook
asked
when
he
saw
her.

“Broth,”
she
announced.
“My
lord
wants
broth.”

He
jerked
his
carving
knife
at
the
black
iron
kettles
hung
over
the
flames.
“What
do
you
think
that
is?
Though
I’d
soon
as
piss
in
it
as
serve
it
to
that
goat.
Can’t
even
let
a
man
have
a
night’s
sleep.”
He
spat.
“Well,
never
you
mind,
run
back
and
tell
him
a
kettle
can’t
be
hurried,”

“I’m
to
wait
here
until
it’s
done.”

“Then
stay
out
of
the
way.
Or
better
yet,
make
yourself
of
use.
Run
to
the
buttery;
his
goatship
will
be
wanting
butter
and
cheese.
Wake
up
Pia
and
tell
her
she’d
best
be
nimble
for
once,
if
she
wants
to
keep
both
of
her
feet.”

She
ran
as
fast
as
she
could.
Pia
was
awake
in
the
loft,
moaning
under
one
of
the
Mummers,
but
she
slipped
back
into
her
clothes
quick
enough
when
she
heard
Arya
shout.
She
filled
six
baskets
with
crocks
of
butter
and
big
wedges
of
stinky
cheese
wrapped
in
cloth.
“Here,
help
me
with
these,”
she
told
Arya.

“I
can’t.
But
you
better
hurry
or
Vargo
Hoat
will
chop
off
your
foot.”
She
darted
off
before
Pia
could
grab
her.
On
the
way
back,
she
wondered
why
none
of
the
captives
had
their
hands
or
feet
chopped
off.
Maybe
Vargo
Hoat
was
afraid
to
make
Robb
angry.
Though
he
didn’t
seem
the
sort
to
be
afraid
of
anyone.

Hot
Pie
was
stirring
the
kettles
with
a
long
wooden
spoon
when
Arya
returned
to
the
kitchens.
She
grabbed
up
a
second
spoon
and
started
to
help.
For
a
moment
she
thought
maybe
she
should
tell
him,
but
then
she
remembered
the
village
and
decided
not
to.
He’d
only
yield
again.

Then
she
heard
the
ugly
sound
of
Rorge’s
voice.
“Cook,”
he
shouted.
“We’ll
take
your
bloody
broth.”
Arya
let
go
of
the
spoon
in
dismay.
I
never
told
him
to
bring
them.
Rorge
wore
his
iron
helmet,
with
the
nasal
that
half
hid
his
missing
nose.
Jaqen
and
Biter
followed
him
into
the
kitchen.

“The
bloody
broth
isn’t
bloody
ready
yet,”
the
cook
said.
“It
needs
to
simmer.
We
only
now
put
in
the
onions
and—”

“Shut
your
hole,
or
I’ll
shove
a
spit
up
your
ass
and
we’ll
baste
you
for
a
turn
or
two.
I
said
broth
and
I
said
now.”

Hissing,
Biter
grabbed
a
handful
of
half-charred
rabbit
right
off
the
spit,
and
tore
into
it
with
his
pointed
teeth
while
honey
dripped
between
his
fingers.

The
cook
was
beaten.
“Take
your
bloody
broth,
then,
but
if
the
goat
asks
why
it
tastes
so
thin,
you
tell
him.”

Biter
licked
the
grease
and
honey
off
his
fingers
as
Jaqen
Hghar
donned
a
pair
of
heavy
padded
mitts.
He
gave
a
second
pair
to
Arya.
“A
weasel
will
help.”
The
broth
was
boiling
hot,
and
the
kettles
were
heavy.
Arya
and
Jaqen
wrestled
one
between
them,
Rorge
carried
one
by
himself,
and
Biter
grabbed
two
more,
hissing
in
pain
when
the
handles
burned
his
hands.
Even
so,
he
did
not
drop
them.
They
lugged
the
kettles
out
of
the
kitchens
and
across
the
ward.
Two
guards
had
been
posted
at
the
door
of
the
Widow’s
Tower.
“What’s
this?”
one
said
to
Rorge.

“A
pot
of
boiling
piss,
want
some?”

Jaqen
smiled
disarmingly.
“A
prisoner
must
eat
too.”

“No
one
said
nothing
about—”

Arya
cut
him
off.
“It’s
for
them,
not
you.”

The
second
guard
waved
them
past.
“Bring
it
down,
then.”

Inside
the
door
a
winding
stair
led
down
to
the
dungeons.
Rorge
led
the
way,
with
Jaqen
and
Arya
bringing
up
the
rear.
“A
girl
will
stay
out
of
the
way,”
he
told
her.

The
steps
opened
onto
a
dank
stone
vault,
long,
gloomy,
and
windowless.
A
few
torches
burned
in
sconces
at
the
near
end
where
a
group
of
Ser
Amory’s
guards
sat
around
a
scarred
wooden
table,
talking
and
playing
at
tiles.
Heavy
iron
bars
separated
them
from
where
the
captives
were
crowded
together
in
the
dark.
The
smell
of
the
broth
brought
many
up
to
the
bars.

Arya
counted
eight
guards.
They
smelled
the
broth
as
well.
“There’s
the
ugliest
serving
wench
I
ever
saw,”
their
captain
said
to
Rorge.
“What’s
in
the
kettle?”

“Your
cock
and
balls.
You
want
to
eat
or
not?”

One
of
the
guards
had
been
pacing,
one
standing
near
the
bars,
a
third
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
wall,
but
the
prospect
of
food
drew
all
of
them
to
the
table.

“About
bloody
time
they
fed
us.”

“That
onions
I
smell?”

“So
where’s
the
bread?”

“Fuck,
we
need
bowls,
cups,
spoons—”

“No
you
don’t.”
Rorge
heaved
the
scalding
hot
broth
across
the
table,
full
in
their
faces.
Jaqen
H’ghar
did
the
same.
Biter
threw
his
kettles
too,
swinging
them
underarm
so
they
spun
across
the
dungeon,
raining
soup.
One
caught
the
captain
in
the
temple
as
he
tried
to
rise.
He
went
down
like
a
sack
of
sand
and
lay
still.
The
rest
were
screaming
in
agony,
praying,
or
trying
to
crawl
off.

Arya
pressed
back
against
the
wall
as
Rorge
began
to
cut
throats.
Biter
preferred
to
grab
the
men
behind
the
head
and
under
the
chin
and
crack
their
necks
with
a
single
twist
of
his
huge
pale
hands.
Only
one
of
the
guards
managed
to
get
a
blade
out.
Jaqen
danced
away
from
his
slash,
drew
his
own
sword,
drove
the
man
back
into
a
corner
with
a
flurry
of
blows,
and
killed
him
with
a
thrust
to
the
heart.
The
Lorathi
brought
the
blade
to
Arya
still
red
with
heart’s
blood
and
wiped
it
clean
on
the
front
of
her
shift.
“A
girl
should
be
bloody
too.
This
is
her
work.”

The
key
to
the
cell
hung
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
above
the
table.
Rorge
took
it
down
and
opened
the
door.
The
first
man
through
was
the
lord
with
the
mailed
fist
on
his
surcoat.
“Well
done,”
he
said.
“I
am
Robett
Glover.”

“My
lord.”
Jaqen
gave
him
a
bow.

Once
freed,
the
captives
stripped
the
dead
guards
of
their
weapons
and
darted
up
the
steps
with
steel
in
hand.
Their
fellows
crowded
after
them,
bare-handed.
They
went
swiftly,
and
with
scarcely
a
word.
None
of
them
seemed
quite
so
badly
wounded
as
they
had
when
Vargo
Hoat
had
marched
them
through
the
gates
of
Harrenhal.
“This
of
the
soup,
that
was
clever,”
the
man
Glover
was
saying.
“I
did
not
expect
that.
Was
it
Lord
Hoat’s
idea?”

Rorge
began
to
laugh.
He
laughed
so
hard
that
snot
flew
out
the
hole
where
his
nose
had
been.
Biter
sat
on
top
of
one
of
the
dead
men,
holding
a
limp
hand
as
he
gnawed
at
the
fingers.
Bones
cracked
between
his
teeth.

“Who
are
you
men?”
A
crease
appeared
between
Robett
Glover’s
brows.
“You
were
not
with
Hoat
when
he
came
to
Lord
Bolton’s
encampment.
Are
you
of
the
Brave
Companions?”

Rorge
wiped
the
snot
off
his
chin
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“We
are
now.”

“This
man
has
the
honor
to
be
Jaqen
H’ghar,
once
of
the
Free
City
of
Lorath.
This
man’s
discourteous
companions
are
named
Rorge
and
Biter.
A
lord
will
know
which
is
Biter.”
He
waved
a
hand
toward
Arya.
“And
here—”

“I’m
Weasel,”
she
blurted,
before
he
could
tell
who
she
really
was.
She
did
not
want
her
name
said
here,
where
Rorge
might
hear,
and
Biter,
and
all
these
others
she
did
not
know.

She
saw
Glover
dismiss
her.
“Very
well,”
he
said.
“Let’s
make
an
end
to
this
bloody
business.”

When
they
climbed
back
up
the
winding
stair,
they
found
the
door
guards
lying
in
pools
of
their
own
blood.
Northmen
were
running
across
the
ward.
Arya
heard
shouts.
The
door
of
Barracks
Hall
burst
open
and
a
wounded
man
staggered
out
screaming.
Three
others
ran
after
him
and
silenced
him
with
spear
and
sword.
There
was
fighting
around
the
gatehouse
as
well.
Rorge
and
Biter
rushed
off
with
Glover,
but
Jaqen
H’ghar
knelt
beside
Arya.
“A
girl
does
not
understand?”

“Yes
I
do,”
she
said,
though
she
didn’t,
not
truly.

The
Lorathi
must
have
seen
it
on
her
face.
“A
goat
has
no
loyalty.
Soon
a
wolf
banner
is
raised
here,
I
think.
But
first
a
man
would
hear
a
certain
name
unsaid.”

“I
take
back
the
name.”
Arya
chewed
her
lip.
“Do
I
still
have
a
third
death?”

“A
girl
is
greedy.”
Jaqen
touched
one
of
the
dead
guards
and
showed
her
his
bloody
fingers.
“Here
is
three
and
there
is
four
and
eight
more
lie
dead
below.
The
debt
is
paid.”

“The
debt
is
paid,”
Arya
agreed
reluctantly.
She
felt
a
little
sad.
Now
she
was
just
a
mouse
again.

“A
god
has
his
due.
And
now
a
man
must
die.”
A
strange
smile
touched
the
lips
of
Jaqen
H’ghar.

“Die?”
she
said,
confused.
What
did
he
mean?
“But
I
unsaid
the
name.
You
don’t
need
to
die
now.”

“I
do.
My
time
is
done.”
Jaqen
passed
a
hand
down
his
face
from
forehead
to
chin,
and
where
it
went
he
changed.
His
cheeks
grew
fuller,
his
eyes
closer;
his
nose
hooked,
a
scar
appeared
on
his
right
cheek
where
no
scar
had
been
before.
And
when
he
shook
his
head,
his
long
straight
hair,
half
red
and
half
white,
dissolved
away
to
reveal
a
cap
of
tight
black
curls.

Arya’s
mouth
hung
open.
“Who
are
you?”
she
whispered,
too
astonished
to
be
afraid.
“How
did
you
do
that?
Was
it
hard?”

He
grinned,
revealing
a
shiny
gold
tooth.
“No
harder
than
taking
a
new
name,
if
you
know
the
way.”

“Show
me,”
she
blurted.
“I
want
to
do
it
too.”

“If
you
would
learn,
you
must
come
with
me.”

Arya
grew
hesitant.
“Where?”

“Far
and
away,
across
the
narrow
sea.”

“I
can’t.
I
have
to
go
home.
To
Winterfell.”

“Then
we
must
part,”
he
said,
“for
I
have
duties
too.”
He
lifted
her
hand
and
pressed
a
small
coin
into
her
palm.
“Here.”

“What
is
it?”

“A
coin
of
great
value.”

Arya
bit
it.
It
was
so
hard
it
could
only
be
iron.
“Is
it
worth
enough
to
buy
a
horse?”

“It
is
not
meant
for
the
buying
of
horses.”

“Then
what
good
is
it?”

“As
well
ask
what
good
is
life,
what
good
is
death?
If
the
day
comes
when
you
would
find
me
again,
give
that
coin
to
any
man
from
Braavos,
and
say
these
words
to
him—valar
morghulis.”

“Valar
morghulis,”
Arya
repeated.
It
wasn’t
hard.
Her
fingers
closed
tight
over
the
coin.
Across
the
yard,
she
could
hear
men
dying.
“Please
don’t
go,
Jaqen.”

“Jaqen
is
as
dead
as
Arry,”
he
said
sadly,
“and
I
have
promises
to
keep.
Valar
morghulis,
Arya
Stark.
Say
it
again.”

“Valar
morghulis,”
she
said
once
more,
and
the
stranger
in
Jaqen’s
clothes
bowed
to
her
and
stalked
off
through
the
darkness,
cloak
swirling.
She
was
alone
with
the
dead
men.
They
deserved
to
die,
Arya
told
herself,
remembering
all
those
Ser
Amory
Lorch
had
killed
at
the
holdfast
by
the
lake.

The
cellars
under
Kingspyre
were
empty
when
she
returned
to
her
bed
of
straw.
She
whispered
her
names
to
her
pillow,
and
when
she
was
done
she
added,
“Valar
morghulis,”
in
a
small
soft
voice,
wondering
what
it
meant.

Come
dawn,
Pinkeye
and
the
others
were
back,
all
but
one
boy
who’d
been
killed
in
the
fighting
for
no
reason
that
anyone
could
say.
Pinkeye
went
up
alone
to
see
how
matters
stood
by
light
of
day,
complaining
all
the
while
that
his
old
bones
could
not
abide
steps.
When
he
returned,
he
told
them
that
Harrenhal
had
been
taken.
“Them
Bloody
Mummers
killed
some
of
Ser
Amory’s
lot
in
their
beds,
and
the
rest
at
table
after
they
were
good
and
drunk.
The
new
lord
will
be
here
before
the
day’s
out,
with
his
whole
host.
He’s
from
the
wild
north
up
where
that
Wall
is,
and
they
say
he’s
a
hard
one.
This
lord
or
that
lord,
there’s
still
work
to
be
done.
Any
foolery
and
I’ll
whip
the
skin
off
your
back.”
He
looked
at
Arya
when
he
said
that,
but
never
said
a
word
to
her
about
where
she
had
been
the
night
before.

All
morning
she
watched
the
Bloody
Mummers
strip
the
dead
of
their
valuables
and
drag
the
corpses
to
the
Flowstone
Yard,
where
a
pyre
was
laid
to
dispose
of
them.
Shagwell
the
Fool
hacked
the
heads
off
two
dead
knights
and
pranced
about
the
castle
swinging
them
by
the
hair
and
making
them
talk.
“What
did
you
die
of?”
one
head
asked.
“Hot
weasel
soup,”
replied
the
second.

Arya
was
set
to
mopping
up
dried
blood.
No
one
said
a
word
to
her
beyond
the
usual,
but
every
so
often
she
would
notice
people
looking
at
her
strangely.
Robett
Glover
and
the
other
men
they’d
freed
must
have
talked
about
what
had
happened
down
in
the
dungeon,
and
then
Shagwell
and
his
stupid
talking
heads
started
in
about
the
weasel
soup.
She
would
have
told
him
to
shut
up,
but
she
was
scared
to.
The
fool
was
half-mad,
and
she’d
heard
that
he’d
once
killed
a
man
for
not
laughing
at
one
of
his
japes.
He
better
shut
his
mouth
or
I’ll
put
him
on
my
list
with
the
rest,
she
thought
as
she
scrubbed
at
a
reddish-brown
stain.
It
was
almost
evenfall
when
the
new
master
of
Harrenhal
arrived.
He
had
a
plain
face,
beardless
and
ordinary,
notable
only
for
his
queer
pale
eyes.
Neither
plump,
thin,
nor
muscular,
he
wore
black
ringmail
and
a
spotted
pink
cloak.
The
sigil
on
his
banner
looked
like
a
man
dipped
in
blood.
“On
your
knees
for
the
Lord
of
the
Dreadfort!”
shouted
his
squire,
a
boy
no
older
than
Arya,
and
Harrenhal
knelt.

Vargo
Hoat
came
forward.
“My
lord,
Harrenhal
ith
yourth.”

The
lord
gave
answer,
but
too
softly
for
Arya
to
hear.
Robett
Glover
and
Ser
Aenys
Frey,
freshly
bathed
and
clad
in
clean
new
doublets
and
cloaks,
came
up
to
join
them.
After
some
brief
talk,
Ser
Aenys
led
them
over
to
Rorge
and
Biter.
Arya
was
surprised
to
see
them
still
here;
somehow
she
would
have
expected
them
to
vanish
when
Jaqen
did.
Arya
heard
the
harsh
sound
of
Rorge’s
voice,
but
not
what
he
was
saying.
Then
Shagwell
pounced
on
her,
dragging
her
out
across
the
yard.
“My
lord,
my
lord,”
he
sang,
tugging
at
her
wrist,
“here’s
the
weasel
who
made
the
soup!”

“Let
go,”
Arya
said,
wriggling
out
of
his
grasp.

The
lord
regarded
her.
Only
his
eyes
moved;
they
were
very
pale,
the
color
of
ice.
“How
old
are
you,
child?”

She
had
to
think
for
a
moment
to
remember.
“Ten.”

“Ten,
my
lord,”
he
reminded
her.
“Are
you
fond
of
animals?”

“Some
kinds.
My
lord.”

A
thin
smile
twitched
across
his
lips.
“But
not
lions,
it
would
seem.
Nor
manticores.”

She
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that,
so
she
said
nothing.

“They
tell
me
you
are
called
Weasel.
That
will
not
serve.
What
name
did
your
mother
give
you?”

She
bit
her
lip,
groping
for
another
name.
Lommy
had
called
her
Lumpyhead,
Sansa
used
Horseface,
and
her
father’s
men
once
dubbed
her
Arya
Underfoot,
but
she
did
not
think
any
of
those
were
the
sort
of
name
he
wanted.

“Nymeria,”
she
said.
“Only
she
called
me
Nan
for
short.”

“You
will
call
me
my
lord
when
you
speak
to
me,
Nan,”
the
lord
said
mildly.
“You
are
too
young
to
be
a
Brave
Companion,
I
think,
and
of
the
wrong
sex.
Are
you
afraid
of
leeches,
child?”

“They’re
only
leeches.
My
lord.”

“My
squire
could
take
a
lesson
from
you,
it
would
seem.
Frequent
leechings
are
the
secret
of
a
long
life.
A
man
must
purge
himself
of
bad
blood.
You
will
do,
I
think.
For
so
long
as
I
remain
at
Harrenhal,
Nan,
you
shall
be
my
cupbearer,
and
serve
me
at
table
and
in
chambers.”

This
time
she
knew
better
than
to
say
that
she’d
sooner
work
in
the
stables.
“Yes,
your
lord.
I
mean,
my
lord.”

The
lord
waved
a
hand.
“Make
her
presentable,”
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular,
“and
make
certain
she
knows
how
to
pour
wine
without
spilling
it.”
Turning
away,
he
lifted
a
hand
and
said,
“Lord
Hoat,
see
to
those
banners
above
the
gatehouse.”

Four
Brave
Companions
climbed
to
the
ramparts
and
hauled
down
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
Ser
Amory’s
own
black
manticore.
In
their
place
they
raised
the
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort
and
the
direwolf
of
Stark.
And
that
evening,
a
page
named
Nan
poured
wine
for
Roose
Bolton
and
Vargo
Hoat
as
they
stood
on
the
gallery,
watching
the
Brave
Companions
parade
Ser
Amory
Lorch
naked
through
the
middle
ward.
Ser
Amory
pleaded
and
sobbed
and
clung
to
the
legs
of
his
captors,
until
Rorge
pulled
him
loose,
and
Shagwell
kicked
him
down
into
the
bear
pit.

The
bear
is
all
in
black,
Arya
thought.
Like
Yoren.
She
filled
Roose
Bolton’s
cup,
and
did
not
spill
a
drop.





DAENERYS

In
this
city
of
splendors,
Dany
had
expected
the
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
to
be
the
most
splendid
of
all,
but
she
emerged
from
her
palanquin
to
behold
a
grey
and
ancient
ruin.

Long
and
low,
without
towers
or
windows,
it
coiled
like
a
stone
serpent
through
a
grove
of
black-barked
trees
whose
inky
blue
leaves
made
the
stuff
of
the
sorcerous
drink
the
Qartheen
called
shade
of
the
evening.
No
other
buildings
stood
near.
Black
tiles
covered
the
palace
roof,
many
fallen
or
broken;
the
mortar
between
the
stones
was
dry
and
crumbling.
She
understood
now
why
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
called
it
the
Palace
of
Dust.
Even
Drogon
seemed
disquieted
by
the
sight
of
it.
The
black
dragon
hissed,
smoke
seeping
out
between
his
sharp
teeth.

“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Jhogo
said
in
Dothraki,
“this
is
an
evil
place,
a
haunt
of
ghosts
and
maegi.
See
how
it
drinks
the
morning
sun?
Let
us
go
before
it
drinks
us
as
well.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
came
up
beside
them.
“What
power
can
they
have
if
they
live
in
that?”

“Heed
the
wisdom
of
those
who
love
you
best,”
said
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos,
lounging
inside
the
palanquin.
“Warlocks
are
bitter
creatures
who
eat
dust
and
drink
of
shadows.
They
will
give
you
naught.
They
have
naught
to
give.”

Aggo
put
a
hand
on
his
arakh.
“Khaleesi,
it
is
said
that
many
go
into
the
Palace
of
Dust,
but
few
come
out.”

“It
is
said,”
Jhogo
agreed.

“We
are
blood
of
your
blood,”
said
Aggo,
“sworn
to
live
and
die
as
you
do.
Let
us
walk
with
you
in
this
dark
place,
to
keep
you
safe
from
harm.”

“Some
places
even
a
khal
must
walk
alone,”
Dany
said.

“Take
me,
then,”
Ser
Jorah
urged.
“The
risk—”

“Queen
Daenerys
must
enter
alone,
or
not
at
all.”
The
warlock
Pyat
Pree
stepped
out
from
under
the
trees.
Has
he
been
there
all
along?
Dany
wondered.
“Should
she
turn
away
now,
the
doors
of
wisdom
shall
be
closed
to
her
forevermore.”

“My
pleasure
barge
awaits,
even
now,”
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
called
out.
“Turn
away
from
this
folly,
most
stubborn
of
queens.
I
have
flutists
who
will
soothe
your
troubled
soul
with
sweet
music,
and
a
small
girl
whose
tongue
will
make
you
sigh
and
melt.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
gave
the
merchant
prince
a
sour
look.
“Your
Grace,
remember
Mirri
Maz
Duur.”

“I
do,”
Dany
said,
suddenly
decided.
“I
remember
that
she
had
knowledge.
And
she
was
only
a
maegi.”

Pyat
Pree
smiled
thinly.
“The
child
speaks
as
sagely
as
a
crone.
Take
my
arm,
and
let
me
lead
you.”

“I
am
no
child.”
Dany
took
his
arm
nonetheless.

It
was
darker
than
she
would
have
thought
under
the
black
trees,
and
the
way
was
longer.
Though
the
path
seemed
to
run
straight
from
the
street
to
the
door
of
the
palace,
Pyat
Pree
soon
turned
aside.
When
she
questioned
him,
the
warlock
said
only,
“The
front
way
leads
in,
but
never
out
again.
Heed
my
words,
my
queen.
The
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
was
not
made
for
mortal
men.
If
you
value
your
soul,
take
care
and
do
just
as
I
tell
you.”

“I
will
do
as
you
say,”
Dany
promised.

“When
you
enter,
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
room
with
four
doors:
the
one
you
have
come
through
and
three
others.
Take
the
door
to
your
right.
Each
time,
the
door
to
your
right.
If
you
should
come
upon
a
stairwell,
climb.
Never
go
down,
and
never
take
any
door
but
the
first
door
to
your
right.”

“The
door
to
my
right,”
Dany
repeated.
“I
understand.
And
when
I
leave,
the
opposite?”

“By
no
means,”
Pyat
Pree
said.
“Leaving
and
coming,
it
is
the
same.
Always
up.
Always
the
door
to
your
right.
Other
doors
may
open
to
you.
Within,
you
will
see
many
things
that
disturb
you.
Visions
of
loveliness
and
visions
of
horror,
wonders
and
terrors.
Sights
and
sounds
of
days
gone
by
and
days
to
come
and
days
that
never
were.
Dwellers
and
servitors
may
speak
to
you
as
you
go.
Answer
or
ignore
them
as
you
choose,
but
enter
no
room
until
you
reach
the
audience
chamber.”

“I
understand.”

“When
you
come
to
the
chamber
of
the
Undying,
be
patient.
Our
little
lives
are
no
more
than
a
flicker
of
a
moth’s
wing
to
them.
Listen
well,
and
write
each
word
upon
your
heart.”

When
they
reached
the
door—a
tall
oval
mouth,
set
in
a
wall
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
a
human
face—the
smallest
dwarf
Dany
had
ever
seen
was
waiting
on
the
threshold.
He
stood
no
higher
than
her
knee,
his
faced
pinched
and
pointed,
snoutish,
but
he
was
dressed
in
delicate
livery
of
purple
and
blue,
and
his
tiny
pink
hands
held
a
silver
tray.
Upon
it
rested
a
slender
crystal
glass
filled
with
a
thick
blue
liquid:
shade
of
the
evening,
the
wine
of
warlocks.
“Take
and
drink,”
urged
Pyat
Pree.

“Will
it
turn
my
lips
blue?”

“One
flute
will
serve
only
to
unstop
your
ears
and
dissolve
the
caul
from
off
your
eyes,
so
that
you
may
hear
and
see
the
truths
that
will
be
laid
before
you.”

Dany
raised
the
glass
to
her
lips.
The
first
sip
tasted
like
ink
and
spoiled
meat,
foul,
but
when
she
swallowed
it
seemed
to
come
to
life
within
her.
She
could
feel
tendrils
spreading
through
her
chest,
like
fingers
of
fire
coiling
around
her
heart,
and
on
her
tongue
was
a
taste
like
honey
and
anise
and
cream,
like
mother’s
milk
and
Drogo’s
seed,
like
red
meat
and
hot
blood
and
molten
gold.
It
was
all
the
tastes
she
had
ever
known,
and
none
of
them…
and
then
the
glass
was
empty.

“Now
you
may
enter,”
said
the
warlock.
Dany
put
the
glass
back
on
the
servitor’s
tray,
and
went
inside.

She
found
herself
in
a
stone
anteroom
with
four
doors,
one
on
each
wall.
With
never
a
hesitation,
she
went
to
the
door
on
her
right
and
stepped
through.
The
second
room
was
a
twin
to
the
first.
Again
she
turned
to
the
right-hand
door.
When
she
pushed
it
open
she
faced
yet
another
small
antechamber
with
four
doors.
I
am
in
the
presence
of
sorcery.

The
fourth
room
was
oval
rather
than
square
and
walled
in
worm-eaten
wood
in
place
of
stone.
Six
passages
led
out
from
it
in
place
of
four.
Dany
chose
the
rightmost,
and
entered
a
long,
dim,
high-ceilinged
hall.
Along
the
right
hand
was
a
row
of
torches
burning
with
a
smoky
orange
light,
but
the
only
doors
were
to
her
left.
Drogon
unfolded
wide
black
wings
and
beat
the
stale
air.
He
flew
twenty
feet
before
thudding
to
an
undignified
crash.
Dany
strode
after
him.

The
mold-eaten
carpet
under
her
feet
had
once
been
gorgeously
colored,
and
whorls
of
gold
could
still
be
seen
in
the
fabric,
glinting
broken
amidst
the
faded
grey
and
mottled
green.
What
remained
served
to
muffle
her
footfalls,
but
that
was
not
all
to
the
good.
Dany
could
hear
sounds
within
the
walls,
a
faint
scurrying
and
scrabbling
that
made
her
think
of
rats.
Drogon
heard
them
too.
His
head
moved
as
he
followed
the
sounds,
and
when
they
stopped
he
gave
an
angry
scream.
Other
sounds,
even
more
disturbing,
came
through
some
of
the
closed
doors.
One
shook
and
thumped,
as
if
someone
were
trying
to
break
through.
From
another
came
a
dissonant
piping
that
made
the
dragon
lash
his
tail
wildly
from
side
to
side.
Dany
hurried
quickly
past.

Not
all
the
doors
were
closed.
I
will
not
look,
Dany
told
herself,
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong.

In
one
room,
a
beautiful
woman
sprawled
naked
on
the
floor
while
four
little
men
crawled
over
her.
They
had
rattish
pointed
faces
and
tiny
pink
hands,
like
the
servitor
who
had
brought
her
the
glass
of
shade.
One
was
pumping
between
her
thighs.
Another
savaged
her
breasts,
worrying
at
the
nipples
with
his
wet
red
mouth,
tearing
and
chewing.

Farther
on
she
came
upon
a
feast
of
corpses.
Savagely
slaughtered,
the
feasters
lay
strewn
across
overturned
chairs
and
hacked
trestle
tables,
asprawl
in
pools
of
congealing
blood.
Some
had
lost
limbs,
even
heads.
Severed
hands
clutched
bloody
cups,
wooden
spoons,
roast
fowl,
heels
of
bread.
In
a
throne
above
them
sat
a
dead
man
with
the
head
of
a
wolf.
He
wore
an
iron
crown
and
held
a
leg
of
lamb
in
one
hand
as
a
king
might
hold
a
scepter,
and
his
eyes
followed
Dany
with
mute
appeal.

She
fled
from
him,
but
only
as
far
as
the
next
open
door.
I
know
this
room,
she
thought.
She
remembered
those
great
wooden
beams
and
the
carved
animal
faces
that
adorned
them.
And
there
outside
the
window,
a
lemon
tree!
The
sight
of
it
made
her
heart
ache
with
longing.
It
is
the
house
with
the
red
door,
the
house
in
Braavos.
No
sooner
had
she
thought
it
than
old
Ser
Willem
came
into
the
room,
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick.
“Little
princess,
there
you
are,”
he
said
in
his
gruff
kind
voice.
“Come,”
he
said,
“come
to
me,
my
lady,
you’re
home
now,
you’re
safe
now.”
His
big
wrinkled
hand
reached
for
her,
soft
as
old
leather,
and
Dany
wanted
to
take
it
and
hold
it
and
kiss
it,
she
wanted
that
as
much
as
she
had
ever
wanted
anything.
Her
foot
edged
forward,
and
then
she
thought,
He’s
dead,
he’s
dead,
the
sweet
old
bear,
he
died
a
long
time
ago.
She
backed
away
and
ran.

The
long
hall
went
on
and
on
and
on,
with
endless
doors
to
her
left
and
only
torches
to
her
right.
She
ran
past
more
doors
than
she
could
count,
closed
doors
and
open
ones,
doors
of
wood
and
doors
of
iron,
carved
doors
and
plain
ones,
doors
with
pulls
and
doors
with
locks
and
doors
with
knockers.
Drogon
lashed
against
her
back,
urging
her
on,
and
Dany
ran
until
she
could
run
no
more.

Finally
a
great
pair
of
bronze
doors
appeared
to
her
left,
grander
than
the
rest.
They
swung
open
as
she
neared,
and
she
had
to
stop
and
look.
Beyond
loomed
a
cavernous
stone
hall,
the
largest
she
had
ever
seen.
The
skulls
of
dead
dragons
looked
down
from
its
walls.
Upon
a
towering
barbed
throne
sat
an
old
man
in
rich
robes,
an
old
man
with
dark
eyes
and
long
silver-grey
hair.
“Let
him
be
king
over
charred
bones
and
cooked
meat,”
he
said
to
a
man
below
him.
“Let
him
be
the
king
of
ashes.”
Drogon
shrieked,
his
claws
digging
through
silk
and
skin,
but
the
king
on
his
throne
never
heard,
and
Dany
moved
on.

Viserys,
was
her
first
thought
the
next
time
she
paused,
but
a
second
glance
told
her
otherwise.
The
man
had
her
brother’s
hair,
but
he
was
taller,
and
his
eyes
were
a
dark
indigo
rather
than
lilac.
“Aegon,”
he
said
to
a
woman
nursing
a
newborn
babe
in
a
great
wooden
bed.
“What
better
name
for
a
king?”

“Will
you
make
a
song
for
him?”
the
woman
asked.

“He
has
a
song,”
the
man
replied.
“He
is
the
prince
that
was
promised,
and
his
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire.”
He
looked
up
when
he
said
it
and
his
eyes
met
Dany’s,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
saw
her
standing
there
beyond
the
door.
“There
must
be
one
more,”
he
said,
though
whether
he
was
speaking
to
her
or
the
woman
in
the
bed
she
could
not
say.
“The
dragon
has
three
heads.”
He
went
to
the
window
seat,
picked
up
a
harp,
and
ran
his
fingers
lightly
over
its
silvery
strings.
Sweet
sadness
filled
the
room
as
man
and
wife
and
babe
faded
like
the
morning
mist,
only
the
music
lingering
behind
to
speed
her
on
her
way.

It
seemed
as
though
she
walked
for
another
hour
before
the
long
hall
finally
ended
in
a
steep
stone
stair,
descending
into
darkness.
Every
door,
open
or
closed,
had
been
to
her
left.
Dany
looked
back
behind
her.
The
torches
were
going
out,
she
realized
with
a
start
of
fear.
Perhaps
twenty
still
burned.
Thirty
at
most.
One
more
guttered
out
even
as
she
watched,
and
the
darkness
came
a
little
farther
down
the
hall,
creeping
toward
her.
And
as
she
listened
it
seemed
as
if
she
heard
something
else
coming,
shuffling
and
dragging
itself
slowly
along
the
faded
carpet.
Terror
filled
her.
She
could
not
go
back
and
she
was
afraid
to
stay
here,
but
how
could
she
go
on?
There
was
no
door
on
her
right,
and
the
steps
went
down,
not
up.

Yet
another
torch
went
out
as
she
stood
pondering,
and
the
sounds
grew
faintly
louder.
Drogon’s
long
neck
snaked
out
and
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
steam
rising
from
between
his
teeth.
He
hears
it
too.
Dany
turned
to
the
blank
wall
once
more,
but
there
was
nothing.
Could
there
be
a
secret
door,
a
door
I
cannot
see?
Another
torch
went
out.
Another.
The
first
door
on
the
right,
he
said,
always
the
first
door
on
the
right.
The
first
door
on
the
right…

It
came
to
her
suddenly…
is
the
last
door
on
the
left!

She
flung
herself
through.
Beyond
was
another
small
room
with
four
doors.
To
the
right
she
went,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
until
she
was
dizzy
and
out
of
breath
once
more.

When
she
stopped,
she
found
herself
in
yet
another
dank
stone
chamber…
but
this
time
the
door
opposite
was
round,
shaped
like
an
open
mouth,
and
Pyat
Pree
stood
outside
in
the
grass
beneath
the
trees.
“Can
it
be
that
the
Undying
are
done
with
you
so
soon?”
he
asked
in
disbelief
when
he
saw
her.

“So
soon?”
she
said,
confused.
“I’ve
walked
for
hours,
and
still
not
found
them.”

“You
have
taken
a
wrong
turning.
Come,
I
will
lead
you.”
Pyat
Pree
held
out
his
hand.

Dany
hesitated.
There
was
a
door
to
her
right,
still
closed…

“That’s
not
the
way,”
Pyat
Pree
said
firmly,
his
blue
lips
prim
with
disapproval.
“The
Undying
Ones
will
not
wait
forever.”

“Our
little
lives
are
no
more
than
a
flicker
of
a
moth’s
wing
to
them,”
Dany
said,
remembering.

“Stubborn
child.
You
will
be
lost,
and
never
found.”

She
walked
away
from
him,
to
the
door
on
the
right.

“No,”
Pyat
screeched.
“No,
to
me,
come
to
me,
to
meeeeeee.”
His
face
crumbled
inward,
changing
to
something
pale
and
wormlike.

Dany
left
him
behind,
entering
a
stairwell.
She
began
to
climb.
Before
long
her
legs
were
aching.
She
recalled
that
the
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
had
seemed
to
have
no
towers.

Finally
the
stair
opened.
To
her
right,
a
set
of
wide
wooden
doors
had
been
thrown
open.
They
were
fashioned
of
ebony
and
weirwood,
the
black
and
white
grains
swirling
and
twisting
in
strange
interwoven
patterns.
They
were
very
beautiful,
yet
somehow
frightening.
The
blood
of
the
dragon
must
not
be
afraid.
Dany
said
a
quick
prayer,
begging
the
Warrior
for
courage
and
the
Dothraki
horse
god
for
strength.
She
made
herself
walk
forward.

Beyond
the
doors
was
a
great
hall
and
a
splendor
of
wizards.
Some
wore
sumptuous
robes
of
ermine,
ruby
velvet,
and
cloth
of
gold.
Others
fancied
elaborate
armor
studded
with
gemstones,
or
tall
pointed
hats
speckled
with
stars.
There
were
women
among
them,
dressed
in
gowns
of
surpassing
loveliness.
Shafts
of
sunlight
slanted
through
windows
of
stained
glass,
and
the
air
was
alive
with
the
most
beautiful
music
she
had
ever
heard.

A
kingly
man
in
rich
robes
rose
when
he
saw
her,
and
smiled.
“Daenerys
of
House
Targaryen,
be
welcome.
Come
and
share
the
food
of
forever.
We
are
the
Undying
of
Qarth.”

“Long
have
we
awaited
you,”
said
a
woman
beside
him,
clad
in
rose
and
silver.
The
breast
she
had
left
bare
in
the
Qartheen
fashion
was
as
perfect
as
a
breast
could
be.

“We
knew
you
were
to
come
to
us,”
the
wizard
king
said.
“A
thousand
years
ago
we
knew,
and
have
been
waiting
all
this
time.
We
sent
the
comet
to
show
you
the
way.”

“We
have
knowledge
to
share
with
you,”
said
a
warrior
in
shining
emerald
armor,
“and
magic
weapons
to
arm
you
with.
You
have
passed
every
trial.
Now
come
and
sit
with
us,
and
all
your
questions
shall
be
answered.”

She
took
a
step
forward.
But
then
Drogon
leapt
from
her
shoulder.
He
flew
to
the
top
of
the
ebony-and-weirwood
door,
perched
there,
and
began
to
bite
at
the
carved
wood.

“A
willful
beast,”
laughed
a
handsome
young
man.
“Shall
we
teach
you
the
secret
speech
of
dragonkind?
Come,
come.”

Doubt
seized
her.
The
great
door
was
so
heavy
it
took
all
of
Dany’s
strength
to
budge
it,
but
finally
it
began
to
move.
Behind
was
another
door,
hidden.
It
was
old
grey
wood,
splintery
and
plain…
but
it
stood
to
the
right
of
the
door
through
which
she’d
entered.
The
wizards
were
beckoning
her
with
voices
sweeter
than
song.
She
ran
from
them,
Drogon
flying
back
down
to
her.
Through
the
narrow
door
she
passed,
into
a
chamber
awash
in
gloom.

A
long
stone
table
filled
this
room.
Above
it
floated
a
human
heart,
swollen
and
blue
with
corruption,
yet
still
alive.
It
beat,
a
deep
ponderous
throb
of
sound,
and
each
pulse
sent
out
a
wash
of
indigo
light.
The
figures
around
the
table
were
no
more
than
blue
shadows.
As
Dany
walked
to
the
empty
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table,
they
did
not
stir,
nor
speak,
nor
turn
to
face
her.
There
was
no
sound
but
the
slow,
deep
beat
of
the
rotting
heart.

…mother
of
dragons…
came
a
voice,
part
whisper
and
part
moan…
dragons…
dragons…
dragons…
other
voices
echoed
in
the
gloom.
Some
were
male
and
some
female.
One
spoke
with
the
timbre
of
a
child.
The
floating
heart
pulsed
from
dimness
to
darkness.
It
was
hard
to
summon
the
will
to
speak,
to
recall
the
words
she
had
practiced
so
assiduously.
“I
am
Daenerys
Stormborn
of
House
Targaryen,
Queen
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros.”
Do
they
hear
me?
Why
don’t
they
move?
She
sat,
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap.
“Grant
me
your
counsel,
and
speak
to
me
with
the
wisdom
of
those
who
have
conquered
death.”

Through
the
indigo
murk,
she
could
make
out
the
wizened
features
of
the
Undying
One
to
her
right,
an
old
old
man,
wrinkled
and
hairless.
His
flesh
was
a
ripe
violet-blue,
his
lips
and
nails
bluer
still,
so
dark
they
were
almost
black.
Even
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
blue.
They
stared
unseeing
at
the
ancient
woman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table,
whose
gown
of
pale
silk
had
rotted
on
her
body.
One
withered
breast
was
left
bare
in
the
Qartheen
manner,
to
show
a
pointed
blue
nipple
hard
as
leather.

She
is
not
breathing.
Dany
listened
to
the
silence.
None
of
them
are
breathing,
and
they
do
not
move,
and
those
eyes
see
nothing.
Could
it
be
that
the
Undying
Ones
were
dead?

Her
answer
was
a
whisper
as
thin
as
a
mouse’s
whisker…
we
live…
live…
live…
it
sounded.
Myriad
other
voices
whispered
echoes…
And
know…
know…
know…
know…

“I
have
come
for
the
gift
of
truth,”
Dany
said.
“In
the
long
hall,
the
things
I
saw…
were
they
true
visions,
or
lies?
Past
things,
or
things
to
come?
What
did
they
mean?”

…the
shape
of
shadows…
morrows
not
yet
made…
drink
from
the
cup
of
ice…
drink
from
the
cup
of
fire…

…mother
of
dragons…
child
of
three…

“Three?”
She
did
not
understand.

…three
heads
has
the
dragon…
the
ghost
chorus
yarnmered
inside
her
skull
with
never
a
lip
moving,
never
a
breath
stirring
the
still
blue
air…
mother
of
dragons…
child
of
storm…
The
whispers
became
a
swirling
song…
three
fires
must
you
light…
one
for
life
and
one
for
death
and
one
to
love…
Her
own
heart
was
beating
in
unison
to
the
one
that
floated
before
her,
blue
and
corrupt…
three
mounts
must
you
ride…
one
to
bed
and
one
to
dread
and
one
to
love…
The
voices
were
growing
louder,
she
realized,
and
it
seemed
her
heart
was
slowing,
and
even
her
breath…
three
treasons
will
you
know…
once
for
blood
and
once
for
gold
and
once
for
love…

“I
don’t…”
Her
voice
was
no
more
than
a
whisper,
almost
as
faint
as
theirs.
What
was
happening
to
her?
“I
don’t
understand,”
she
said,
more
loudly.
Why
was
it
so
hard
to
talk
here?
“Help
me.
Show
me.”

…help
her…
the
whispers
mocked…
show
her…

Then
phantoms
shivered
through
the
murk,
images
in
indigo.
Viserys
screamed
as
the
molten
gold
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
filled
his
mouth.
A
tall
lord
with
copper
skin
and
silver-gold
hair
stood
beneath
the
banner
of
a
fiery
stallion,
a
burning
city
behind
him.
Rubies
flew
like
drops
of
blood
from
the
chest
of
a
dying
prince,
and
he
sank
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
with
his
last
breath
murmured
a
woman’s
name…
mother
of
dragons,
daughter
of
death…
Glowing
like
sunset,
a
red
sword
was
raised
in
the
hand
of
a
blue-eyed
king
who
cast
no
shadow.
A
cloth
dragon
swayed
on
poles
amidst
a
cheering
crowd.
From
a
smoking
tower,
a
great
stone
beast
took
wing,
breathing
shadow
fire…
mother
of
dragons,
slayer
of
lies…
Her
silver
was
trotting
through
the
grass,
to
a
darkling
stream
beneath
a
sea
of
stars.
A
corpse
stood
at
the
prow
of
a
ship,
eyes
bright
in
his
dead
face,
grey
lips
smiling
sadly.
A
blue
flower
grew
from
a
chink
in
a
wall
of
ice,
and
filled
the
air
with
sweetness…
mother
of
dragons,
bride
of
fire…

Faster
and
faster
the
visions
came,
one
after
the
other,
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
air
had
come
alive.
Shadows
whirled
and
danced
inside
a
tent,
boneless
and
terrible.
A
little
girl
ran
barefoot
toward
a
big
house
with
a
red
door.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
shrieked
in
the
flames,
a
dragon
bursting
from
her
brow.
Behind
a
silver
horse
the
bloody
corpse
of
a
naked
man
bounced
and
dragged.
A
white
lion
ran
through
grass
taller
than
a
man.
Beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
a
line
of
naked
crones
crept
from
a
great
lake
and
knelt
shivering
before
her,
their
grey
heads
bowed.
Ten
thousand
slaves
lifted
bloodstained
hands
as
she
raced
by
on
her
silver,
riding
like
the
wind.
“Mother!”
they
cried.
“Mother,
mother!”
They
were
reaching
for
her,
touching
her,
tugging
at
her
cloak,
the
hem
of
her
skirt,
her
foot,
her
leg,
her
breast.
They
wanted
her,
needed
her,
the
fire,
the
life,
and
Dany
gasped
and
opened
her
arms
to
give
herself
to
them…

But
then
black
wings
buffeted
her
round
the
head,
and
a
scream
of
fury
cut
the
indigo
air,
and
suddenly
the
visions
were
gone,
ripped
away,
and
Dany’s
gasp
turned
to
horror.
The
Undying
were
all
around
her,
blue
and
cold,
whispering
as
they
reached
for
her,
pulling,
stroking,
tugging
at
her
clothes,
touching
her
with
their
dry
cold
hands,
twining
their
fingers
through
her
hair.
All
the
strength
had
left
her
limbs.
She
could
not
move.
Even
her
heart
had
ceased
to
beat.
She
felt
a
hand
on
her
bare
breast,
twisting
her
nipple.
Teeth
found
the
soft
skin
of
her
throat.
A
mouth
descended
on
one
eye,
licking,
sucking,
biting…

Then
indigo
turned
to
orange,
and
whispers
turned
to
screams.
Her
heart
was
pounding,
racing,
the
hands
and
mouths
were
gone,
heat
washed
over
her
skin,
and
Dany
blinked
at
a
sudden
glare.
Perched
above
her,
the
dragon
spread
his
wings
and
tore
at
the
terrible
dark
heart,
ripping
the
rotten
flesh
to
ribbons,
and
when
his
head
snapped
forward,
fire
flew
from
his
open
jaws,
bright
and
hot.
She
could
hear
the
shrieks
of
the
Undying
as
they
burned,
their
high
thin
papery
voices
crying
out
in
tongues
long
dead.
Their
flesh
was
crumbling
parchment,
their
bones
dry
wood
soaked
in
tallow.
They
danced
as
the
flames
consumed
them;
they
staggered
and
writhed
and
spun
and
raised
blazing
hands
on
high,
their
fingers
bright
as
torches.

Dany
pushed
herself
to
her
feet
and
bulled
through
them.
They
were
light
as
air,
no
more
than
husks,
and
they
fell
at
a
touch.
The
whole
room
was
ablaze
by
the
time
she
reached
the
door.
“Drogon,”
she
called,
and
he
flew
to
her
through
the
fire.

Outside
a
long
dim
passageway
stretched
serpentine
before
her,
lit
by
the
flickering
orange
glare
from
behind.
Dany
ran,
searching
for
a
door,
a
door
to
her
right,
a
door
to
her
left,
any
door,
but
there
was
nothing,
only
twisty
stone
walls,
and
a
floor
that
seemed
to
move
slowly
under
her
feet,
writhing
as
if
to
trip
her.
She
kept
her
feet
and
ran
faster,
and
suddenly
the
door
was
there
ahead
of
her,
a
door
like
an
open
mouth.

When
she
spilled
out
into
the
sun,
the
bright
light
made
her
stumble.
Pyat
Pree
was
gibbering
in
some
unknown
tongue
and
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other.
When
Dany
looked
behind
her,
she
saw
thin
tendrils
of
smoke
forcing
their
way
through
cracks
in
the
ancient
stone
walls
of
the
Palace
of
Dust,
and
rising
from
between
the
black
tiles
of
the
roof.

Howling
curses,
Pyat
Pree
drew
a
knife
and
danced
toward
her,
but
Drogon
flew
at
his
face.
Then
she
heard
the
crack
of
Jhogo’s
whip,
and
never
was
a
sound
so
sweet.
The
knife
went
flying,
and
an
instant
later
Rakharo
was
slamming
Pyat
to
the
ground.
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
knelt
beside
Dany
in
the
cool
green
grass
and
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulder.





TYRION

“If
you
die
stupidly,
I’m
going
to
feed
your
body
to
the
goats,”
Tyrion
threatened
as
the
first
load
of
Stone
Crows
pushed
off
from
the
quay.

Shagga
laughed.
“The
Halfman
has
no
goats.”

“I’ll
get
some
just
for
you.”

Dawn
was
breaking,
and
pale
ripples
of
light
shimmered
on
the
surface
of
the
river,
shattering
under
the
poles
and
reforming
when
the
ferry
had
passed.
Timett
had
taken
his
Burned
Men
into
the
kingswood
two
days
before.
Yesterday
the
Black
Ears
and
Moon
Brothers
followed,
today
the
Stone
Crows.

“Whatever
you
do,
don’t
try
and
fight
a
battle,”
Tyrion
said.
“Strike
at
their
camps
and
baggage
train.
Ambush
their
scouts
and
hang
the
bodies
from
trees
ahead
of
their
line
of
march,
loop
around
and
cut
down
stragglers.
I
want
night
attacks,
so
many
and
so
sudden
that
they’ll
be
afraid
to
sleep—”

Shagga
laid
a
hand
atop
Tyrion’s
head.
“All
this
I
learned
from
Dolf
son
of
Holger
before
my
beard
had
grown.
This
is
the
way
of
war
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.”

“The
kingswood
is
not
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
and
you
won’t
be
fighting
Milk
Snakes
and
Painted
Dogs.
And
listen
to
the
guides
I’m
sending,
they
know
this
wood
as
well
as
you
know
your
mountains.
Heed
their
counsel
and
they’ll
serve
you
well.”

“Shagga
will
listen
to
the
Halfman’s
pets,”
the
clansman
promised
solemnly.
And
then
it
was
time
for
him
to
lead
his
garron
onto
the
ferry.
Tyrion
watched
them
push
off
and
pole
out
toward
the
center
of
the
Blackwater.
He
felt
a
queer
twinge
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
as
Shagga
faded
in
the
morning
mist.
He
was
going
to
feel
naked
without
his
clansmen.

He
still
had
Bronn’s
hirelings,
near
eight
hundred
of
them
now,
but
sellswords
were
notoriously
fickle.
Tyrion
had
done
what
he
could
to
buy
their
continued
loyalty,
promising
Bronn
and
a
dozen
of
his
best
men
lands
and
knighthoods
when
the
battle
was
won.
They’d
drunk
his
wine,
laughed
at
his
jests,
and
called
each
other
ser
until
they
were
all
staggering…
all
but
Bronn
himself,
who’d
only
smiled
that
insolent
dark
smile
of
his
and
afterward
said,
“They’ll
kill
for
that
knighthood,
but
don’t
ever
think
they’ll
die
for
it.”

Tyrion
had
no
such
delusion.

The
gold
cloaks
were
almost
as
uncertain
a
weapon.
Six
thousand
men
in
the
City
Watch,
thanks
to
Cersei,
but
only
a
quarter
of
them
could
be
relied
upon.
“There’s
few
out-and-out
traitors,
though
there’s
some,
even
your
spider
hasn’t
found
them
all,”
Bywater
had
warned
him.
“But
there’s
hundreds
greener
than
spring
grass,
men
who
joined
for
bread
and
ale
and
safety.
No
man
likes
to
look
craven
in
the
sight
of
his
fellows,
so
they’ll
fight
brave
enough
at
the
start,
when
it’s
all
warhorns
and
blowing
banners.
But
if
the
battle
looks
to
be
going
sour
they’ll
break,
and
they’ll
break
bad.
The
first
man
to
throw
down
his
spear
and
run
will
have
a
thousand
more
trodding
on
his
heels.”

To
be
sure,
there
were
seasoned
men
in
the
City
Watch,
the
core
of
two
thousand
who’d
gotten
their
gold
cloaks
from
Robert,
not
Cersei.
Yet
even
those…
a
watchman
was
not
truly
a
soldier,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
had
been
fond
of
saying.
Of
knights
and
squires
and
men-at-arms,
Tyrion
had
no
more
than
three
hundred.
Soon
enough,
he
must
test
the
truth
of
another
of
his
father’s
sayings:
One
man
on
a
wall
was
worth
ten
beneath
it.

Bronn
and
the
escort
were
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
quay,
amidst
swarming
beggars,
strolling
whores,
and
fishwives
crying
the
catch.
The
fishwives
did
more
business
than
all
the
rest
combined.
Buyers
flocked
around
the
barrels
and
stalls
to
haggle
over
winkles,
clams,
and
river
pike.
With
no
other
food
coming
into
the
city,
the
price
of
fish
was
ten
times
what
it
had
been
before
the
war,
and
still
rising.
Those
who
had
coin
came
to
the
riverfront
each
morning
and
each
evening,
in
hopes
of
bringing
home
an
eel
or
a
pot
of
red
crabs;
those
who
did
not
slipped
between
the
stalls
hoping
to
steal,
or
stood
gaunt
and
forlorn
beneath
the
walls.

The
gold
cloaks
cleared
a
path
through
the
press,
shoving
people
aside
with
the
shafts
of
their
spears.
Tyrion
ignored
the
muttered
curses
as
best
he
could.
A
fish
came
sailing
out
of
the
crowd,
slimy
and
rotten.
It
landed
at
his
feet
and
flew
to
pieces.
He
stepped
over
it
gingerly
and
climbed
into
his
saddle.
Children
with
swollen
bellies
were
already
fighting
over
pieces
of
the
stinking
fish.

Mounted,
he
gazed
along
the
riverfront.
Hammers
rang
in
the
morning
air
as
carpenters
swarmed
over
the
Mud
Gate,
extending
wooden
hoardings
from
the
battlements.
Those
were
coming
well.
He
was
a
deal
less
pleased
by
the
clutter
of
ramshackle
structures
that
had
been
allowed
to
grow
up
behind
the
quays,
attaching
themselves
to
the
city
walls
like
barnacles
on
the
hull
of
a
ship;
bait
shacks
and
pot-shops,
warehouses,
merchants’
stalls,
alehouses,
the
cribs
where
the
cheaper
sort
of
whores
spread
their
legs.
It
has
to
go,
every
bit
of
it.
As
it
was,
Stannis
would
hardly
need
scaling
ladders
to
storm
the
walls.

He
called
Bronn
to
his
side.
“Assemble
a
hundred
men
and
burn
everything
you
see
here
between
the
water’s
edge
and
the
city
walls.”
He
waved
his
stubby
fingers,
taking
in
all
the
waterfront
squalor.
“I
want
nothing
left
standing,
do
you
understand?”

The
black-haired
sellsword
turned
his
head,
considering
the
task.
“Them
as
own
all
this
won’t
like
that
much.”

“I
never
imagined
they
would.
So
be
it;
they’ll
have
something
else
to
curse
the
evil
monkey
demon
for.”

“Some
may
fight.”

“See
that
they
lose.”

“What
do
we
do
with
those
that
live
here?”

“Let
them
have
a
reasonable
time
to
remove
their
property,
and
then
move
them
out.
Try
not
to
kill
any
of
them,
they’re
not
the
enemy.
And
no
more
rapes!
Keep
your
men
in
line,
damn
it.”

“They’re
sellswords,
not
septons,”
said
Bronn.
“Next
you’ll
be
telling
me
you
want
them
sober.”

“It
couldn’t
hurt.”

Tyrion
only
wished
he
could
as
easily
make
city
walls
twice
as
tall
and
three
times
as
thick.
Though
perhaps
it
did
not
matter.
Massive
walls
and
tall
towers
had
not
saved
Storm’s
End,
nor
Harrenhal,
nor
even
Winterfell.

He
remembered
Winterfell
as
he
had
last
seen
it.
Not
as
grotesquely
huge
as
Harrenhal,
nor
as
solid
and
impregnable
to
look
at
as
Storm’s
End,
yet
there
had
been
a
great
strength
in
those
stones,
a
sense
that
within
those
walls
a
man
might
feel
safe.
The
news
of
the
castle’s
fall
had
come
as
a
wrenching
shock.
“The
gods
give
with
one
hand
and
take
with
the
other,”
he
muttered
under
his
breath
when
Varys
told
him.
They
had
given
the
Starks
Harrenhal
and
taken
Winterfell,
a
dismal
exchange.

No
doubt
he
should
be
rejoicing.
Robb
Stark
would
have
to
turn
north
now.
If
he
could
not
defend
his
own
home
and
hearth,
he
was
no
sort
of
king
at
all.
It
meant
reprieve
for
the
west,
for
House
Lannister,
and
yet…

Tyrion
had
only
the
vaguest
memory
of
Theon
Greyjoy
from
his
time
with
the
Starks.
A
callow
youth,
always
smiling,
skilled
with
a
bow;
it
was
hard
to
imagine
him
as
Lord
of
Winterfell.
The
Lord
of
Winterfell
would
always
be
a
Stark.

He
remembered
their
godswood;
the
tall
sentinels
armored
in
their
grey-green
needles,
the
great
oaks,
the
hawthorn
and
ash
and
soldier
pines,
and
at
the
center
the
heart
tree
standing
like
some
pale
giant
frozen
in
time.
He
could
almost
smell
the
place,
earthy
and
brooding,
the
smell
of
centuries,
and
he
remembered
how
dark
the
wood
had
been
even
by
day.
That
wood
was
Winterfell.
It
was
the
north.
I
never
felt
so
out
of
place
as
I
did
when
I
walked
there,
so
much
an
unwelcome
intruder.
He
wondered
if
the
Greyjoys
would
feel
it
too.
The
castle
might
well
be
theirs,
but
never
that
godswood.
Not
in
a
year,
or
ten,
or
fifty.

Tyrion
Lannister
walked
his
horse
slowly
toward
the
Mud
Gate.
Winterfell
is
nothing
to
you,
he
reminded
himself.
Be
glad
the
place
has
fallen,
and
look
to
your
own
walls.
The
gate
was
open.
Inside,
three
great
trebuchets
stood
side
by
side
in
the
market
square,
peering
over
the
battlements
like
three
huge
birds.
Their
throwing
arms
were
made
from
the
trunks
of
old
oaks,
and
banded
with
iron
to
keep
them
from
splitting.
The
gold
cloaks
had
named
them
the
Three
Whores,
because
they’d
be
giving
Lord
Stannis
such
a
lusty
welcome.
Or
so
we
hope.

Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
trotted
through
the
Mud
Gate,
breasting
the
human
tide.
Once
beyond
the
Whores,
the
press
grew
thinner
and
the
street
opened
up
around
him.

The
ride
back
to
the
Red
Keep
was
uneventful,
but
at
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
he
found
a
dozen
angry
trader
captains
waiting
in
his
audience
chamber
to
protest
the
seizure
of
their
ships.
He
gave
them
a
sincere
apology
and
promised
compensation
once
the
war
was
done.
That
did
little
to
appease
them.
“What
if
you
should
lose,
my
lord?”
one
Braavosi
asked.

“Then
apply
to
King
Stannis
for
your
compensation.”

By
the
time
he
rid
himself
of
them,
bells
were
ringing
and
Tyrion
knew
he
would
be
late
for
the
installation.
He
waddled
across
the
yard
almost
at
a
run
and
crowded
into
the
back
of
the
castle
sept
as
Joffrey
fastened
white
silk
cloaks
about
the
shoulders
of
the
two
newest
members
of
his
Kingsguard.
The
rite
seemed
to
require
that
everyone
stand,
so
Tyrion
saw
nothing
but
a
wall
of
courtly
arses.
On
the
other
hand,
once
the
new
High
Septon
was
finished
leading
the
two
knights
through
their
solemn
vows
and
anointing
them
in
the
names
of
the
Seven,
he
would
be
well
positioned
to
be
first
out
the
doors.

He
approved
of
his
sister’s
choice
of
Ser
Balon
Swann
to
take
the
place
of
the
slain
Preston
Greenfield.
The
Swanns
were
Marcher
lords,
proud,
powerful,
and
cautious.
Pleading
illness,
Lord
Gulian
Swann
had
remained
in
his
castle,
taking
no
part
in
the
war,
but
his
eldest
son
had
ridden
with
Renly
and
now
Stannis,
while
Balon,
the
younger,
served
at
King’s
Landing.
If
he’d
had
a
third
son,
Tyrion
suspected
he’d
be
off
with
Robb
Stark.
It
was
not
perhaps
the
most
honorable
course,
but
it
showed
good
sense;
whoever
won
the
iron
Throne,
the
Swanns
intended
to
survive.
In
addition
to
being
well
born,
young
Ser
Balon
was
valiant,
courtly,
and
skilled
at
arms;
good
with
a
lance,
better
with
a
morningstar,
superb
with
the
bow.
He
would
serve
with
honor
and
courage.

Alas,
Tyrion
could
not
say
the
same
for
Cersei’s
second
choice.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
looked
formidable
enough.
He
stood
six
feet
and
six
inches,
most
of
it
sinew
and
muscle,
and
his
hook
nose,
bushy
eyebrows,
and
spade-shaped
brown
beard
gave
his
face
a
fierce
aspect,
so
long
as
he
did
not
smile.
Lowborn,
no
more
than
a
hedge
knight,
Kettleblack
was
utterly
dependent
on
Cersei
for
his
advancement,
which
was
doubtless
why
she’d
picked
him.
“Ser
Osmund
is
as
loyal
as
he
is
brave,”
she’d
told
Joffrey
when
she
put
forward
his
name.
It
was
true,
unfortunately.
The
good
Ser
Osmund
had
been
selling
her
secrets
to
Bronn
since
the
day
she’d
hired
him,
but
Tyrion
could
scarcely
tell
her
that.

He
supposed
he
ought
not
complain.
The
appointment
gave
him
another
ear
close
to
the
king,
unbeknownst
to
his
sister.
And
even
if
Ser
Osmund
proved
an
utter
craven,
he
would
be
no
worse
than
Ser
Boros
Blount,
currently
residing
in
a
dungeon
at
Rosby.
Ser
Boros
had
been
escorting
Tommen
and
Lord
Gyles
when
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
and
his
gold
cloaks
had
surprised
them,
and
had
yielded
up
his
charge
with
an
alacrity
that
would
have
enraged
old
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
as
much
as
it
did
Cersei;
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
was
supposed
to
die
in
defense
of
the
king
and
royal
family.
His
sister
had
insisted
that
Joffrey
strip
Blount
of
his
white
cloak
on
the
grounds
of
treason
and
cowardice.
And
now
she
replaces
him
with
another
man
just
as
hollow.

The
praying,
vowing,
and
anointing
seemed
to
take
most
of
the
morning.
Tyrion’s
legs
soon
began
to
ache.
He
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other,
restless.
Lady
Tanda
stood
several
rows
up,
he
saw,
but
her
daughter
was
not
with
her.
He
had
been
half
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
Shae.
Varys
said
she
was
doing
well,
but
he
would
prefer
to
see
for
himself.

“Better
a
lady’s
maid
than
a
pot
girl,”
Shae
had
said
when
Tyrion
told
her
the
eunuch’s
scheme.
“Can
I
take
my
belt
of
silver
flowers
and
my
gold
collar
with
the
black
diamonds
you
said
looked
like
my
eyes?
I
won’t
wear
them
if
you
say
I
shouldn’t.”

Loath
as
he
was
to
disappoint
her,
Tyrion
had
to
point
out
that
while
Lady
Tanda
was
by
no
means
a
clever
woman,
even
she
might
wonder
if
her
daughter’s
bedmaid
seemed
to
own
more
jewelry
than
her
daughter.
“Choose
two
or
three
dresses,
no
more,”
he
commanded
her.
“Good
wool,
no
silk,
no
samite,
and
no
fur.
The
rest
I’ll
keep
in
my
own
chambers
for
when
you
visit
me.”
It
was
not
the
answer
Shae
had
wanted,
but
at
least
she
was
safe.

When
the
investiture
was
finally
done
Joffrey
marched
out
between
Ser
Balon
and
Ser
Osmund
in
their
new
white
cloaks,
while
Tyrion
lingered
for
a
word
with
the
new
High
Septon
(who
was
his
choice,
and
wise
enough
to
know
who
put
the
honey
on
his
bread).
“I
want
the
gods
on
our
side,”
Tyrion
told
him
bluntly.
“Tell
them
that
Stannis
has
vowed
to
burn
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.”

“Is
it
true,
my
lord?”
asked
the
High
Septon,
a
small,
shrewd
man
with
a
wispy
white
beard
and
wizened
face.

Tyrion
shrugged.
“It
may
be.
Stannis
burned
the
godswood
at
Storm’s
End
as
an
offering
to
the
Lord
of
Light.
If
he’d
offend
the
old
gods,
why
should
he
spare
the
new?
Tell
them
that.
Tell
them
that
any
man
who
thinks
to
give
aid
to
the
usurper
betrays
the
gods
as
well
as
his
rightful
king.”

“I
shall,
my
lord.
And
I
shall
command
them
to
pray
for
the
health
of
the
king
and
his
Hand
as
well.”

Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
was
waiting
on
him
when
Tyrion
returned
to
his
solar,
and
Maester
Frenken
had
brought
messages.
He
let
the
alchemist
wait
a
little
longer
while
he
read
what
the
ravens
had
brought
him.
There
was
an
old
letter
from
Doran
Martell,
warning
him
that
Storm’s
End
had
fallen,
and
a
much
more
intriguing
one
from
Balon
Greyjoy
on
Pyke,
who
styled
himself
King
of
the
Isles
and
the
North.
He
invited
King
Joffrey
to
send
an
envoy
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
fix
the
borders
between
their
realms
and
discuss
a
possible
alliance.

Tyrion
read
the
letter
three
times
and
set
it
aside.
Lord
Balon’s
longships
would
have
been
a
great
help
against
the
fleet
sailing
up
from
Storm’s
End,
but
they
were
thousands
of
leagues
away
on
the
wrong
side
of
Westeros,
and
Tyrion
was
far
from
certain
that
he
wanted
to
give
away
half
the
realm.
Perhaps
I
should
spill
this
one
in
Cersei’s
lap,
or
take
it
to
the
council.

Only
then
did
he
admit
Hallyne
with
the
latest
tallies
from
the
alchemists.
“This
cannot
be
true,”
said
Tyrion
as
he
pored
over
the
ledgers.
“Almost
thirteen
thousand
jars?
Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?
I’m
not
about
to
pay
the
king’s
gold
for
empty
jars
and
pots
of
sewage
sealed
with
wax,
I
warn
you.”

“No,
no,”
Hallyne
squeaked,
“the
sums
are
accurate,
I
swear.
We
have
been,
hmmm,
most
fortunate,
my
lord
Hand.
Another
cache
of
Lord
Rossart’s
was
found,
more
than
three
hundred
jars.
Under
the
Dragonpit!
Some
whores
have
been
using
the
ruins
to
entertain
their
patrons,
and
one
of
them
fell
through
a
patch
of
rotted
floor
into
a
cellar.
When
he
felt
the
jars,
he
mistook
them
for
wine.
He
was
so
drunk
he
broke
the
seal
and
drank
some.”

“There
was
a
prince
who
tried
that
once,”
said
Tyrion
dryly.
“I
haven’t
seen
any
dragons
rising
over
the
city,
so
it
would
seem
it
didn’t
work
this
time
either.”
The
Dragonpit
atop
the
hill
of
Rhaenys
had
been
abandoned
for
a
century
and
a
half.
He
supposed
it
was
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
store
wildfire,
and
better
than
most,
but
it
would
have
been
nice
if
the
late
Lord
Rossart
had
told
someone.
“Three
hundred
jars,
you
say?
That
still
does
not
account
for
these
totals.
You
are
several
thousand
jars
ahead
of
the
best
estimate
you
gave
me
when
last
we
met.”

“Yes,
yes,
that’s
so.”
Hallyne
mopped
at
his
pale
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
his
black-and-scarlet
robe.
“We
have
been
working
very
hard,
my
lord
Hand,
hmmm.”

“That
would
doubtless
explain
why
you
are
making
so
much
more
of
the
substance
than
before.”
Smiling,
Tyrion
fixed
the
pyromancer
with
his
mismatched
stare.
“Though
it
does
raise
the
question
of
why
you
did
not
begin
working
hard
until
now.”

Hallyne
had
the
complexion
of
a
mushroom,
so
it
was
hard
to
see
how
he
could
turn
any
paler,
yet
somehow
he
managed.
“We
were,
my
lord
Hand,
my
brothers
and
I
have
been
laboring
day
and
night
from
the
first,
I
assure
you.
It
is
only,
hmmm,
we
have
made
so
much
of
the
substance
that
we
have
become,
hmmm,
more
practiced
as
it
were,
and
also”—the
alchemist
shifted
uncomfortably—“certain
spells,
hmmm,
ancient
secrets
of
our
order,
very
delicate,
very
troublesome,
but
necessary
if
the
substance
is
to
be,
hmmm,
all
it
should
be…”

Tyrion
was
growing
impatient.
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
was
likely
here
by
now,
and
Ironhand
misliked
waiting.
“Yes,
you
have
secret
spells;
how
splendid.
What
of
them?”

“They,
hmmm,
seem
to
be
working
better
than
they
were.”
Hallyne
smiled
weakly.
“You
don’t
suppose
there
are
any
dragons
about,
do
you?”

“Not
unless
you
found
one
under
the
Dragonpit.
Why?”

“Oh,
pardon,
I
was
just
remembering
something
old
Wisdom
Pollitor
told
me
once,
when
I
was
an
acolyte.
I’d
asked
him
why
so
many
of
our
spells
seemed,
well,
not
as
effectual
as
the
scrolls
would
have
us
believe,
and
he
said
it
was
because
magic
had
begun
to
go
out
of
the
world
the
day
the
last
dragon
died.”

“Sorry
to
disappoint
you,
but
I’ve
seen
no
dragons.
I
have
noticed
the
King’s
Justice
lurking
about,
however.
Should
any
of
these
fruits
you’re
selling
me
turn
out
to
be
filled
with
anything
but
wildfire,
you’ll
be
seeing
him
as
well.”

Hallyne
fled
so
quickly
that
he
almost
bowled
over
Ser
Jacelyn—no,
Lord
Jacelyn,
he
must
remember
that.
Ironhand
was
mercifully
direct,
as
ever.
He’d
returned
from
Rosby
to
deliver
a
fresh
levy
of
spearmen
recruited
from
Lord
Gyles’s
estates
and
resume
his
command
of
the
City
Watch.
“How
does
my
nephew
fare?”
Tyrion
asked
when
they
were
done
discussing
the
city’s
defenses.

“Prince
Tommen
is
hale
and
happy,
my
lord.
He
has
adopted
a
fawn
some
of
my
men
brought
home
from
a
hunt.
He
had
one
once
before,
he
says,
but
Joffrey
skinned
her
for
a
jerkin.
He
asks
about
his
mother
sometimes,
and
often
begins
letters
to
the
Princess
Myrcella,
though
he
never
seems
to
finish
any.
His
brother,
however,
he
does
not
seem
to
miss
at
all.”

“You
have
made
suitable
arrangements
for
him,
should
the
battle
be
lost?”

“My
men
have
their
instructions.”

“Which
are?”

“You
commanded
me
to
tell
no
one,
my
lord.”

That
made
him
smile.
“I’m
pleased
you
remember.”
Should
King’s
Landing
fall,
he
might
well
be
taken
alive.
Better
if
he
did
not
know
where
Joffrey’s
heir
might
be
found.

Varys
appeared
not
long
after
Lord
Jacelyn
had
left.
“Men
are
such
faithless
creatures,”
he
said
by
way
of
greeting.

Tyrion
sighed.
“Who’s
the
traitor
today?”

The
eunuch
handed
him
a
scroll.
“So
much
villainy,
it
sings
a
sad
song
for
our
age.
Did
honor
die
with
our
fathers?”

“My
father
is
not
dead
yet.”
Tyrion
scanned
the
list.
“I
know
some
of
these
names.
These
are
rich
men.
Traders,
merchants,
craftsmen.
Why
should
they
conspire
against
us?”

“It
seems
they
believe
that
Lord
Stannis
must
win,
and
wish
to
share
his
victory.
They
call
themselves
the
Antler
Men,
after
the
crowned
stag.”

“Someone
should
tell
them
that
Stannis
changed
his
sigil.
Then
they
can
be
the
Hot
Hearts.”
It
was
no
matter
for
jests,
though;
it
appeared
that
these
Antler
Men
had
armed
several
hundred
followers,
to
seize
the
Old
Gate
once
battle
was
joined,
and
admit
the
enemy
to
the
city.
Among
the
names
on
the
list
was
the
master
armorer
Salloreon.
“I
suppose
this
means
I
won’t
be
getting
that
terrifying
helm
with
the
demon
horns,”
Tyrion
complained
as
he
scrawled
the
order
for
the
man’s
arrest.





THEON

One
moment
he
was
asleep;
the
next,
awake.

Kyra
nestled
against
him,
one
arm
draped
lightly
over
his,
her
breasts
brushing
his
back.
He
could
hear
her
breathing,
soft
and
steady.
The
sheet
was
tangled
about
them.
It
was
the
black
of
night.
The
bedchamber
was
dark
and
still.

What
is
it?
Did
I
hear
something?
Someone?

Wind
sighed
faintly
against
the
shutters.
Somewhere,
far
off,
he
heard
the
yowl
of
a
cat
in
heat.
Nothing
else.
Sleep,
Greyjoy,
he
told
himself.
The
castle
is
quiet,
and
you
have
guards
posted.
At
your
door,
at
the
gates,
on
the
armory.

He
might
have
put
it
down
to
a
bad
dream,
but
he
did
not
remember
dreaming.
Kyra
had
worn
him
out.
Until
Theon
had
sent
for
her,
she
had
lived
all
of
her
eighteen
years
in
the
winter
town
without
ever
setting
foot
inside
the
walls
of
the
castle.
She
came
to
him
wet
and
eager
and
lithe
as
a
weasel,
and
there
had
been
a
certain
undeniable
spice
to
fucking
a
common
tavern
wench
in
Lord
Eddard
Stark’s
own
bed.

She
murmured
sleepily
as
Theon
slid
out
from
under
her
arm
and
got
to
his
feet.
A
few
embers
still
smoldered
in
the
hearth.
Wex
slept
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
rolled
up
inside
his
cloak
and
dead
to
the
world.
Nothing
moved.
Theon
crossed
to
the
window
and
threw
open
the
shutters.
Night
touched
him
with
cold
fingers,
and
gooseprickles
rose
on
his
bare
skin.
He
leaned
against
the
stone
sill
and
looked
out
on
dark
towers,
empty
yards,
black
sky,
and
more
stars
than
a
man
could
ever
count
if
he
lived
to
be
a
hundred.
A
half-moon
floated
above
the
Bell
Tower
and
cast
its
reflection
on
the
roof
of
the
glass
gardens.
He
heard
no
alarms,
no
voices,
not
so
much
as
a
footfall.

All’s
well,
Greyjoy.
Hear
the
quiet?
You
ought
to
be
drunk
with
joy.
You
took
Winterfell
with
fewer
than
thirty
men,
a
feat
to
sing
of.
Theon
started
back
to
bed.
He’d
roll
Kyra
on
her
back
and
fuck
her
again,
that
ought
to
banish
these
phantoms.
Her
gasps
and
giggles
would
make
a
welcome
respite
from
this
silence.

He
stopped.
He
had
grown
so
used
to
the
howling
of
the
direwolves
that
he
scarcely
heard
it
anymore…
but
some
part
of
him,
some
hunter’s
instinct,
heard
its
absence.

Urzen
stood
outside
his
door,
a
sinewy
man
with
a
round
shield
slung
over
his
back.
“The
wolves
are
quiet,”
Theon
told
him.
“Go
see
what
they’re
doing,
and
come
straight
back.”
The
thought
of
the
direwolves
running
loose
gave
him
a
queasy
feeling.
He
remembered
the
day
in
the
wolfswood
when
the
wildlings
had
attacked
Bran.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
had
torn
them
to
pieces.

When
he
prodded
Wex
with
the
toe
of
his
boot,
the
boy
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes.
“Make
certain
Bran
Stark
and
his
little
brother
are
in
their
beds,
and
be
quick
about
it.”

“M’lord?”
Kyra
called
sleepily.

“Go
back
to
sleep,
this
does
not
concern
you.”
Theon
poured
himself
a
cup
of
wine
and
drank
it
down.
All
the
time
he
was
listening,
hoping
to
hear
a
howl.
Too
few
men,
he
thought
sourly.
I
have
too
few
men.
If
Asha
does
not
come…

Wex
returned
the
quickest,
shaking
his
head
side
to
side.
Cursing,
Theon
found
his
tunic
and
breeches
on
the
floor
where
he
had
dropped
them
in
his
haste
to
get
at
Kyra.
Over
the
tunic
he
donned
a
jerkin
of
iron-studded
leather,
and
he
belted
a
longsword
and
dagger
at
his
waist.
His
hair
was
wild
as
the
wood,
but
he
had
larger
concerns.

By
then
Urzen
was
back.
“The
wolves
be
gone.”

Theon
told
himself
he
must
be
as
cold
and
deliberate
as
Lord
Eddard.
“Rouse
the
castle,”
he
said.
“Herd
them
out
into
the
yard,
everyone,
we’ll
see
who’s
missing.
And
have
Lorren
make
a
round
of
the
gates.
Wex,
with
me.”

He
wondered
if
Stygg
had
reached
Deepwood
Motte
yet.
The
man
was
not
as
skilled
a
rider
as
he
claimed—none
of
the
ironmen
were
much
good
in
the
saddle—but
there’d
been
time
enough.
Asha
might
well
be
on
her
way.
And
if
she
learns
that
I
have
lost
the
Starks…
It
did
not
bear
thinking
about.

Bran’s
bedchamber
was
empty,
as
was
Rickon’s
half
a
turn
below.
Theon
cursed
himself.
He
should
have
kept
a
guard
on
them,
but
he’d
deemed
it
more
important
to
have
men
walking
the
walls
and
protecting
the
gates
than
to
nursemaid
a
couple
of
children,
one
a
cripple.

Outside
he
heard
sobbing
as
the
castle
folk
were
pulled
from
their
beds
and
driven
into
the
yard.
I’ll
give
them
reason
to
sob.
I’ve
used
them
gently,
and
this
is
how
they
repay
me.
He’d
even
had
two
of
his
own
men
whipped
bloody
for
raping
that
kennel
girl,
to
show
them
he
meant
to
be
just.
They
still
blame
me
for
the
rape,
though.
And
the
rest.
He
deemed
that
unfair.
Mikken
had
killed
himself
with
his
mouth,
just
as
Benfred
had.
As
for
Chayle,
he
had
to
give
someone
to
the
Drowned
God,
his
men
expected
it.
“I
bear
you
no
ill
will,”
he’d
told
the
septon
before
they
threw
him
down
the
well,
“but
you
and
your
gods
have
no
place
here
now.”
You’d
think
the
others
might
be
grateful
he
hadn’t
chosen
one
of
them,
but
no.
He
wondered
how
many
of
them
were
part
of
this
plot
against
him.

Urzen
returned
with
Black
Lorren.
“The
Hunter’s
Gate,”
Lorren
said.
“Best
come
see.”

The
Hunter’s
Gate
was
conveniently
sited
close
to
the
kennels
and
kitchens.
It
opened
directly
on
fields
and
forests,
allowing
riders
to
come
and
go
without
first
passing
through
the
winter
town,
and
so
was
favored
by
hunting
parties.
“Who
had
the
guard
here?”
Theon
demanded.

“Drennan
and
Squint.”

Drennan
was
one
of
the
men
who’d
raped
Palla.
“If
they’ve
let
the
boys
escape,
I’ll
have
more
than
a
little
skin
off
their
back
this
time,
I
swear
it.”

“No
need
for
that,”
Black
Lorren
said
curtly.

Nor
was
there.
They
found
Squint
floating
facedown
in
the
moat,
his
entrails
drifting
behind
him
like
a
nest
of
pale
snakes.
Drennan
lay
half
naked
in
the
gatehouse,
in
the
snug
room
where
the
drawbridge
was
worked.
His
throat
had
been
opened
ear
to
ear.
A
ragged
tunic
concealed
the
half-healed
scars
on
his
back,
but
his
boots
were
scattered
amidst
the
rushes,
and
his
breeches
tangled
about
his
feet.
There
was
cheese
on
a
small
table
near
the
door,
beside
an
empty
flagon.
And
two
cups.

Theon
picked
one
up
and
sniffed
at
the
dregs
of
wine
in
the
bottom.
“Squint
was
up
on
the
wallwalk,
no?”

“Aye,”
said
Lorren.

Theon
flung
the
cup
into
the
hearth.
“I’d
say
Drennan
was
pulling
down
his
breeches
to
stick
it
in
the
woman
when
she
stuck
it
in
him.
His
own
cheese
knife,
by
the
look
of
it.
Someone
find
a
pike
and
fish
the
other
fool
out
of
the
moat.”

The
other
fool
was
in
a
deal
worse
shape
than
Drennan.
When
Black
Lorren
drew
him
out
of
the
water,
they
saw
that
one
of
his
arms
had
been
wrenched
off
at
the
elbow,
half
of
his
neck
was
missing,
and
there
was
a
ragged
hole
where
his
navel
and
groin
once
had
been.
The
pike
tore
through
his
bowels
as
Lorren
was
pulling
him
in.
The
stench
was
awful.

“The
direwolves,”
Theon
said.
“Both
of
them,
at
a
guess.”
Disgusted,
he
walked
back
to
the
drawbridge.
Winterfell
was
encircled
by
two
massive
granite
walls,
with
a
wide
moat
between
them.
The
outer
wall
stood
eighty
feet
high,
the
inner
more
than
a
hundred.
Lacking
men,
Theon
had
been
forced
to
abandon
the
outer
defenses
and
post
his
guards
along
the
higher
inner
walls.
He
dared
not
risk
having
them
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
moat
should
the
castle
rise
against
him.

There
had
to
be
two
or
more,
he
decided.
While
the
woman
was
entertaining
Drennan,
the
others
freed
the
wolves.

Theon
called
for
a
torch
and
led
them
up
the
steps
to
the
wallwalk.
He
swept
the
flame
low
before
him,
looking
for…
there.
On
the
inside
of
the
rampart
and
in
the
wide
crenel
between
two
upthrust
merlons.
“Blood,”
he
announced,
“clumsily
mopped
up.
At
a
guess,
the
woman
killed
Drennan
and
lowered
the
drawbridge.
Squint
heard
the
clank
of
chains,
came
to
have
a
look,
and
got
this
far.
They
pushed
the
corpse
through
the
crenel
into
the
moat
so
he
wouldn’t
be
found
by
another
sentry.”

Urzen
peered
along
the
walls.
“The
other
watch
turrets
are
not
far.
I
see
torches
burning—”

“Torches,
but
no
guards,”
Theon
said
testily.
“Winterfell
has
more
turrets
than
I
have
men.”

“Four
guards
at
the
main
gate,”
said
Black
Lorren,
“and
five
walking
the
walls
beside
Squint.”

Urzen
said,
“If
he
had
sounded
his
horn—”

I
am
served
by
fools.
“Try
and
imagine
it
was
you
up
here,
Urzen.
It’s
dark
and
cold.
You
have
been
walking
sentry
for
hours,
looking
forward
to
the
end
of
your
watch.
Then
you
hear
a
noise
and
move
toward
the
gate,
and
suddenly
you
see
eyes
at
the
top
of
the
stair,
glowing
green
and
gold
in
the
torchlight.
Two
shadows
come
rushing
toward
you
faster
than
you
can
believe.
You
catch
a
glimpse
of
teeth,
start
to
level
your
spear,
and
they
slam
into
you
and
open
your
belly,
tearing
through
leather
as
if
it
were
cheesecloth.”
He
gave
Urzen
a
hard
shove.
“And
now
you’re
down
on
your
back,
your
guts
are
spilling
out,
and
one
of
them
has
his
teeth
around
your
neck.”
Theon
grabbed
the
man’s
scrawny
throat,
tightened
his
fingers,
and
smiled.
“Tell
me,
at
what
moment
during
all
of
this
do
you
stop
to
blow
your
fucking
horn?”
He
shoved
Urzen
away
roughly,
sending
him
stumbling
back
against
a
merlon.
The
man
rubbed
his
throat.
I
should
have
had
those
beasts
put
down
the
day
we
took
the
castle,
he
thought
angrily.
I’d
seen
them
kill,
I
knew
how
dangerous
they
were.

“We
must
go
after
them,”
Black
Lorren
said.

“Not
in
the
dark.”
Theon
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
chasing
direwolves
through
the
wood
by
night;
the
hunters
could
easily
become
the
hunted.
“We’ll
wait
for
daylight.
Until
then,
I
had
best
go
speak
with
my
loyal
subjects.”

Down
in
the
yard,
a
uneasy
crowd
of
men,
women,
and
children
had
been
pushed
up
against
the
wall.
Many
had
not
been
given
time
to
dress;
they
covered
themselves
with
woolen
blankets,
or
huddled
naked
under
cloaks
or
bedrobes.
A
dozen
ironmen
hemmed
them
in,
torches
in
one
hand
and
weapons
in
the
other.
The
wind
was
gusting,
and
the
flickering
orange
light
reflected
dully
off
steel
helms,
thick
beards,
and
unsmiling
eyes.

Theon
walked
up
and
down
before
the
prisoners,
studying
the
faces.
They
all
looked
guilty
to
him.
“How
many
are
missing?”

“Six.”
Reek
stepped
up
behind
him,
smelling
of
soap,
his
long
hair
moving
in
the
wind.
“Both
Starks,
that
bog
boy
and
his
sister,
the
halfwit
from
the
stables,
and
your
wildling
woman.”

Osha.
He
had
suspected
her
from
the
moment
he
saw
that
second
cup.
I
should
have
known
better
than
to
trust
that
one.
She’s
as
unnatural
as
Asha.
Even
their
names
sound
alike.

“Has
anyone
had
a
look
at
the
stables?”

“Aggar
says
no
horses
are
missing.”

“Dancer
is
still
in
his
stall?”

“Dancer?”
Reek
frowned.
“Aggar
says
the
horses
are
all
there.
Only
the
halfwit
is
missing.”

They’re
afoot,
then.
That
was
the
best
news
he’d
heard
since
he
woke.
Bran
would
be
riding
in
his
basket
on
Hodor’s
back,
no
doubt.
Osha
would
need
to
carry
Rickon;
his
little
legs
wouldn’t
take
him
far
on
their
own.
Theon
was
confident
that
he’d
soon
have
them
back
in
his
hands.
“Bran
and
Rickon
have
fled,”
he
told
the
castle
folk,
watching
their
eyes.
“Who
knows
where
they’ve
gone?”
No
one
answered.
“They
could
not
have
escaped
without
help,”
Theon
went
on.
“Without
food,
clothing,
weapons.”
He
had
locked
away
every
sword
and
axe
in
Winterfell,
but
no
doubt
some
had
been
hidden
from
him.
“I’ll
have
the
names
of
all
those
who
aided
them.
All
those
who
turned
a
blind
eye.”
The
only
sound
was
the
wind.
“Come
first
light,
I
mean
to
bring
them
back.”
He
hooked
his
thumbs
through
his
swordbelt.
“I
need
huntsmen.
Who
wants
a
nice
warm
wolfskin
to
see
them
through
the
winter?
Gage?”
The
cook
had
always
greeted
him
cheerfully
when
he
returned
from
the
hunt,
to
ask
whether
he’d
brought
anything
choice
for
the
table,
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
now.
Theon
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come,
searching
their
faces
for
the
least
sign
of
guilty
knowledge.
“The
wild
is
no
place
for
a
cripple.
And
Rickon,
young
as
he
is,
how
long
will
he
last
out
there?
Nan,
think
how
frightened
he
must
be.”
The
old
woman
had
nattered
at
him
for
ten
years,
telling
her
endless
stories,
but
now
she
gaped
at
him
as
if
he
were
some
stranger.
“I
might
have
killed
every
man
of
you
and
given
your
women
to
my
soldiers
for
their
pleasure,
but
instead
I
protected
you.
Is
this
the
thanks
you
offer?”
Joseth
who’d
groomed
his
horses,
Farlen
who’d
taught
him
all
he
knew
of
hounds,
Barth
the
brewer’s
wife
who’d
been
his
first—not
one
of
them
would
meet
his
eyes.
They
hate
me,
he
realized.

Reek
stepped
close.
“Strip
off
their
skins,”
he
urged,
his
thick
lips
glistening.
“Lord
Bolton,
he
used
to
say
a
naked
man
has
few
secrets,
but
a
flayed
man’s
got
none.”

The
flayed
man
was
the
sigil
of
House
Bolton,
Theon
knew;
ages
past,
certain
of
their
lords
had
gone
so
far
as
to
cloak
themselves
in
the
skins
of
dead
enemies.
A
number
of
Starks
had
ended
thus.
Supposedly
all
that
had
stopped
a
thousand
years
ago,
when
the
Boltons
had
bent
their
knees
to
Winterfell.
Or
so
they
say,
but
old
ways
die
hard,
as
well
I
know.

“There
will
be
no
flaying
in
the
north
so
long
as
I
rule
in
Winterfell,”
Theon
said
loudly.
I
am
your
only
protection
against
the
likes
of
him,
he
wanted
to
scream.
He
could
not
be
that
blatant,
but
perhaps
some
were
clever
enough
to
take
the
lesson.

The
sky
was
greying
over
the
castle
walls.
Dawn
could
not
be
far
off.
“Joseth,
saddle
Smiler
and
a
horse
for
yourself.
Murch,
Gariss,
Poxy
Tym,
you’ll
come
as
well.”
Murch
and
Gariss
were
the
best
huntsmen
in
the
castle,
and
Tym
was
a
fine
bowman.
“Aggar,
Rednose,
Gelmarr,
Reek,
Wex.”
He
needed
his
own
to
watch
his
back.
“Farlen,
I’ll
want
hounds,
and
you
to
handle
them.”

The
grizzled
kennelmaster
crossed
his
arms.
“And
why
would
I
care
to
hunt
down
my
own
trueborn
lords,
and
babes
at
that?”

Theon
moved
close.
“I
am
your
trueborn
lord
now,
and
the
man
who
keeps
Palla
safe.”

He
saw
the
defiance
die
in
Farlen’s
eyes.
“Aye,
m’lord.”

Stepping
back,
Theon
glanced
about
to
see
who
else
he
might
add.
“Maester
Luwin,”
he
announced.

“I
know
nothing
of
hunting.”

No,
but
I
don’t
trust
you
in
the
castle
in
my
absence.
“Then
it’s
past
time
you
learned.”

“Let
me
come
too.
I
want
that
wolfskin
cloak.”
A
boy
stepped
forward,
no
older
than
Bran.
It
took
Theon
a
moment
to
remember
him.
“I’ve
hunted
lots
of
times
before,”
Walder
Frey
said.
“Red
deer
and
elk,
and
even
boar.”

His
cousin
laughed
at
him.
“He
rode
on
a
boar
hunt
with
his
father,
but
they
never
let
him
near
the
boar.”

Theon
look
at
the
boy
doubtfully.
“Come
if
you
like,
but
if
you
can’t
keep
up,
don’t
think
that
I’ll
nurse
you
along.”
He
turned
back
to
Black
Lorren.
“Winterfell
is
yours
in
my
absence.
If
we
do
not
return,
do
with
it
as
you
will.”
That
bloody
well
ought
to
have
them
praying
for
my
success.

They
assembled
by
the
Hunter’s
Gate
as
the
first
pale
rays
of
the
sun
brushed
the
top
of
the
Bell
Tower,
their
breath
frosting
in
the
cold
morning
air.
Gelmarr
had
equipped
himself
with
a
longaxe
whose
reach
would
allow
him
to
strike
before
the
wolves
were
on
him.
The
blade
was
heavy
enough
to
kill
with
a
single
blow.
Aggar
wore
steel
greaves.
Reek
arrived
carrying
a
boar
spear
and
an
overstuffed
washerwoman’s
sack
bulging
with
god
knows
what.
Theon
had
his
bow;
he
needed
nothing
else.
Once
he
had
saved
Bran’s
life
with
an
arrow.
He
hoped
he
would
not
need
to
take
it
with
another,
but
if
it
came
to
that,
he
would.

Eleven
men,
two
boys,
and
a
dozen
dogs
crossed
the
moat.
Beyond
the
outer
wall,
the
tracks
were
plain
to
read
in
the
soft
ground;
the
pawprints
of
the
wolves,
Hodor’s
heavy
tread,
the
shallower
marks
left
by
the
feet
of
the
two
Reeds.
Once
under
the
trees,
the
stony
ground
and
fallen
leaves
made
the
trail
harder
to
see,
but
by
then
Farlen’s
red
bitch
had
the
scent.
The
rest
of
the
dogs
were
close
behind,
the
hounds
sniffing
and
barking,
a
pair
of
monstrous
mastiffs
bringing
up
the
rear.
Their
size
and
ferocity
might
make
the
difference
against
a
cornered
direwolf.

He’d
have
guessed
that
Osha
might
run
south
to
Ser
Rodrik,
but
the
trail
led
north
by
northwest,
into
the
very
heart
of
the
wolfswood.
Theon
did
not
like
that
one
bit.
It
would
be
a
bitter
irony
if
the
Starks
made
for
Deepwood
Motte
and
delivered
themselves
right
into
Asha’s
hands.
I’d
sooner
have
them
dead,
he
thought
bitterly.
It
is
better
to
be
seen
as
cruel
than
foolish.

Wisps
of
pale
mist
threaded
between
the
trees.
Sentinels
and
soldier
pines
grew
thick
about
here,
and
there
was
nothing
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
an
evergreen
forest.
The
ground
was
uneven,
and
the
fallen
needles
disguised
the
softness
of
the
turf
and
made
the
footing
treacherous
for
the
horses,
so
they
had
to
go
slowly.
Not
as
slowly
as
a
man
carrying
a
cripple,
though,
or
a
bony
harridan
with
a
four-year-old
on
her
back.
He
told
himself
to
be
patient.
He’d
have
them
before
the
day
was
out.

Maester
Luwin
trotted
up
to
him
as
they
were
following
a
game
trail
along
the
lip
of
a
ravine.
“Thus
far
hunting
seems
indistinguishable
from
riding
through
the
woods,
my
lord.”

Theon
smiled.
“There
are
similarities.
But
with
hunting,
there’s
blood
at
the
end.”

“Must
it
be
so?
This
flight
was
great
folly,
but
will
you
not
be
merciful?
These
are
your
foster
brothers
we
seek.”

“No
Stark
but
Robb
was
ever
brotherly
toward
me,
but
Bran
and
Rickon
have
more
value
to
me
living
than
dead.”

“The
same
is
true
of
the
Reeds.
Moat
Cailin
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
bogs.
Lord
Howland
can
make
your
uncle’s
occupation
a
visit
to
hell
if
he
chooses,
but
so
long
as
you
hold
his
heirs
he
must
stay
his
hand.”

Theon
had
not
considered
that.
In
truth,
he
had
scarcely
considered
the
mudmen
at
all,
beyond
eyeing
Meera
once
or
twice
and
wondering
if
she
was
still
a
maiden.
“You
may
be
right.
We
will
spare
them
if
we
can.”

“And
Hodor
too,
I
hope.
The
boy
is
simple,
you
know
that.
He
does
as
he
is
told.
How
many
times
has
he
groomed
your
horse,
soaped
your
saddle,
scoured
your
mail?”

Hodor
was
nothing
to
him.
“if
he
does
not
fight
us,
we
will
let
him
live.”
Theon
pointed
a
finger.
“But
say
one
word
about
sparing
the
wildling,
and
you
can
die
with
her.
She
swore
me
an
oath,
and
pissed
on
it.”

The
maester
inclined
his
head.
“I
make
no
apologies
for
oathbreakers.
Do
what
you
must.
I
thank
you
for
your
mercy.”

Mercy,
thought
Theon
as
Luwin
dropped
back.
There’s
a
bloody
trap.
Too
much
and
they
call
you
weak,
too
little
and
you’re
monstrous.
Yet
the
maester
had
given
him
good
counsel,
he
knew.
His
father
thought
only
in
terms
of
conquest,
but
what
good
was
it
to
take
a
kingdom
if
you
could
not
hold
it?
Force
and
fear
could
carry
you
only
so
far.
A
pity
Ned
Stark
had
taken
his
daughters
south;
elsewise
Theon
could
have
tightened
his
grip
on
Winterfell
by
marrying
one
of
them.
Sansa
was
a
pretty
little
thing
too,
and
by
now
likely
even
ripe
for
bedding.
But
she
=======
the
white
knight
had
probably
killed
him,
and
anyhow
she
was
only
a
little
girl
with
a
wooden
stick,
alone
and
afraid.

She
squirmed
out
into
the
yard,
glancing
around
warily
as
she
climbed
to
her
feet.
The
castle
seemed
deserted.
The
Red
Keep
was
never
deserted.
All
the
people
must
be
hiding
inside,
their
doors
barred.
Arya
glanced
up
longingly
at
her
bedchamber,
then
moved
away
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
keeping
close
to
the
wall
as
she
slid
from
shadow
to
shadow.
She
pretended
she
was
chasing
cats…
except
she
was
the
cat
now,
and
if
they
caught
her,
they
would
kill
her.

Moving
between
buildings
and
over
walls,
keeping
stone
to
her
back
wherever
possible
so
no
one
could
surprise
her,
Arya
reached
the
stables
almost
without
incident.
A
dozen
gold
cloaks
in
mail
and
plate
ran
past
as
she
was
edging
across
the
inner
bailey,
but
without
knowing
whose
side
they
were
on,
she
hunched
down
low
in
the
shadows
and
let
them
pass.

Hullen,
who
had
been
master
of
horse
at
Winterfell
as
long
as
Arya
could
remember,
was
slumped
on
the
ground
by
the
stable
door.
He
had
been
stabbed
so
many
times
it
looked
as
if
his
tunic
was
patterned
with
scarlet
flowers.
Arya
was
certain
he
was
dead,
but
when
she
crept
closer,
his
eyes
opened.
“Arya
Underfoot,”
he
whispered.
“You
must…
warn
your…
your
lord
father…”
Frothy
red
spittle
bubbled
from
his
mouth.
The
master
of
horse
closed
his
eyes
again
and
said
no
more.

Inside
were
more
bodies;
a
groom
she
had
played
with,
and
three
of
her
father’s
household
guard.
A
wagon,
laden
with
crates
and
chests,
stood
abandoned
near
the
door
of
the
stable.
The
dead
men
must
have
been
loading
it
for
the
trip
to
the
docks
when
they
were
attacked.
Arya
snuck
closer.
One
of
the
corpses
was
Desmond,
who’d
shown
her
his
longsword
and
promised
to
protect
her
father.
He
lay
on
his
back,
staring
blindly
at
the
ceiling
as
flies
crawled
across
his
eyes.
Close
to
him
was
a
dead
man
in
the
red
cloak
and
lion-crest
helm
of
the
Lannisters.
Only
one,
though.
Every
northerner
is
worth
ten
of
these
southron
swords,
Desmond
had
told
her.
“You
liar!”
she
said,
kicking
his
body
in
a
sudden
fury.

The
animals
were
restless
in
their
stalls,
whickering
and
snorting
at
the
scent
of
blood.
Arya’s
only
plan
was
to
saddle
a
horse
and
flee,
away
from
the
castle
and
the
city.
All
she
had
to
do
was
stay
on
the
kingsroad
and
it
would
take
her
back
to
Winterfell.
She
took
a
bridle
and
harness
off
the
wall.

As
she
crossed
in
back
of
the
wagon,
a
fallen
chest
caught
her
eye.
It
must
have
been
knocked
down
in
the
fight
or
dropped
as
it
was
being
loaded.
The
wood
had
split,
the
lid
opening
to
spill
the
chest’s
contents
across
the
ground.
Arya
recognized
silks
and
satins
and
velvets
she
never
wore.
She
might
need
warm
clothes
on
the
kingsroad,
though…
and
besides…

Arya
knelt
in
the
dirt
among
the
scattered
clothes.
She
found
a
heavy
woolen
cloak,
a
velvet
skirt
and
a
silk
tunic
and
some
smallclothes,
a
dress
her
mother
had
embroidered
for
her,
a
silver
baby
bracelet
she
might
sell.
Shoving
the
broken
lid
out
of
the
way,
she
groped
inside
the
chest
for
Needle.
She
had
hidden
it
way
down
at
the
bottom,
under
everything,
but
her
stuff
had
all
been
jumbled
around
when
the
chest
was
dropped.
For
a
moment
Arya
was
afraid
someone
had
found
the
sword
and
stolen
it.
Then
her
fingers
felt
the
hardness
of
metal
under
a
satin
gown.

“There
she
is,”
a
voice
hissed
close
behind
her.

Startled,
Arya
whirled.
A
stableboy
stood
behind
her,
a
smirk
on
his
face,
his
filthy
white
undertunic
peeking
out
from
beneath
a
soiled
jerkin.
His
boots
were
covered
with
manure,
and
he
had
a
pitchfork
in
one
hand.
“Who
are
you?”
she
asked.

“She
don’t
know
me,”
he
said,
“but
I
knows
her,
oh,
yes.
The
wolf
girl.”

“Help
me
saddle
a
horse,”
Arya
pleaded,
reaching
back
into
the
chest,
groping
for
Needle.
“My
father’s
the
Hand
of
the
King,
he’ll
reward
you.”

“Father’s
dead,”
the
boy
said.
He
shuffled
toward
her.
“It’s
the
queen
who’ll
be
rewarding
me.
Come
here,
girl.”

“Stay
away!”
Her
fingers
closed
around
Needle’s
hilt.

“I
says,
come.”
He
grabbed
her
arm,
hard.

Everything
Syrio
Forel
had
ever
taught
her
vanished
in
a
heartbeat.
In
that
instant
of
sudden
terror,
the
only
lesson
Arya
could
remember
was
the
one
Jon
Snow
had
given
her,
the
very
first.

She
stuck
him
with
the
pointy
end,
driving
the
blade
upward
with
a
wild,
hysterical
strength.

Needle
went
through
his
leather
jerkin
and
the
white
flesh
of
his
belly
and
came
out
between
his
shoulder
blades.
The
boy
dropped
the
pitchfork
and
made
a
soft
noise,
something
between
a
gasp
and
a
sigh.
His
hands
closed
around
the
blade.
“Oh,
gods,”
he
moaned,
as
his
undertunic
began
to
redden.
“Take
it
out.”

When
she
took
it
out,
he
died.

The
horses
were
screaming.
Arya
stood
over
the
body,
still
and
frightened
in
the
face
of
death.
Blood
had
gushed
from
the
boy’s
mouth
as
he
collapsed,
and
more
was
seeping
from
the
slit
in
his
belly,
pooling
beneath
his
body.
His
palms
were
cut
where
he’d
grabbed
at
the
blade.
She
backed
away
slowly,
Needle
red
in
her
hand.
She
had
to
get
away,
someplace
far
from
here,
someplace
safe
away
from
the
stableboy’s
accusing
eyes.

She
snatched
up
the
bridle
and
harness
again
and
ran
to
her
mare,
but
as
she
lifted
the
saddle
to
the
horse’s
back,
Arya
realized
with
a
sudden
sick
dread
that
the
castle
gates
would
be
closed.
Even
the
postern
doors
would
likely
be
guarded.
Maybe
the
guards
wouldn’t
recognize
her.
If
they
thought
she
was
a
boy,
perhaps
they’d
let
her…
no,
they’d
have
orders
not
to
let
anyone
out,
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
they
knew
her
or
not.

But
there
was
another
way
out
of
the
castle…

The
saddle
slipped
from
Arya’s
fingers
and
fell
to
the
dirt
with
a
thump
and
a
puff
of
dust.
Could
she
find
the
room
with
the
monsters
again?
She
wasn’t
certain,
yet
she
knew
she
had
to
try.

She
found
the
clothing
she’d
gathered
and
slipped
into
the
cloak,
concealing
Needle
beneath
its
folds.
The
rest
of
her
things
she
tied
in
a
roll.
With
the
bundle
under
her
arm,
she
crept
to
the
far
end
of
the
stable.
Unlatching
the
back
door,
she
peeked
out
anxiously.
She
could
hear
the
distant
sound
of
swordplay,
and
the
shivery
wail
of
a
man
screaming
in
pain
across
the
bailey.
She
would
need
to
go
down
the
serpentine
steps,
past
the
small
kitchen
and
the
pig
yard,
that
was
how
she’d
gone
last
time,
chasing
the
black
tomcat…
only
that
would
take
her
right
past
the
barracks
of
the
gold
cloaks.
She
couldn’t
go
that
way.
Arya
tried
to
think
of
another
way.
If
she
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
castle,
she
could
creep
along
the
river
wall
and
through
the
little
godswood…
but
first
she’d
have
to
cross
the
yard,
in
the
plain
view
of
the
guards
on
the
walls.

She
had
never
seen
so
many
men
on
the
walls.
Gold
cloaks,
most
of
them,
armed
with
spears.
Some
of
them
knew
her
by
sight.
What
would
they
do
if
they
saw
her
running
across
the
yard?
She’d
look
so
small
from
up
there,
would
they
be
able
to
tell
who
she
was?
Would
they
care?

She
had
to
leave
now,
she
told
herself,
but
when
the
moment
came,
she
was
too
frightened
to
move.

Calm
as
still
water,
a
small
voice
whispered
in
her
ear.
Arya
was
so
startled
she
almost
dropped
her
bundle.
She
looked
around
wildly,
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
stable
but
her,
and
the
horses,
and
the
dead
men.

Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
heard.
Was
it
her
own
voice,
or
Syrio’s?
She
could
not
tell,
yet
somehow
it
calmed
her
fears.

She
stepped
out
of
the
stable.

It
was
the
scariest
thing
she’d
ever
done.
She
wanted
to
run
and
hide,
but
she
made
herself
walk
across
the
yard,
slowly,
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
as
if
she
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
and
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
anyone.
She
thought
she
could
feel
their
eyes,
like
bugs
crawling
on
her
skin
under
her
clothes.
Arya
never
looked
up.
If
she
saw
them
watching,
all
her
courage
would
desert
her,
she
knew,
and
she
would
drop
the
bundle
of
clothes
and
run
and
cry
like
a
baby,
and
then
they
would
have
her.
She
kept
her
gaze
on
the
ground.
By
the
time
she
reached
the
shadow
of
the
royal
sept
on
the
far
side
of
the
yard,
Arya
was
cold
with
sweat,
but
no
one
had
raised
the
hue
and
cry.

The
sept
was
open
and
empty.
Inside,
half
a
hundred
prayer
candles
burned
in
a
fragrant
silence.
Arya
figured
the
gods
would
never
miss
two.
She
stuffed
them
up
her
sleeves,
and
left
by
a
back
window.
Sneaking
back
to
the
alley
where
she
had
cornered
the
one-eared
tom
was
easy,
but
after
that
she
got
lost.
She
crawled
in
and
out
of
windows,
hopped
over
walls,
and
felt
her
way
through
dark
cellars,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Once
she
heard
a
woman
weeping.
It
took
her
more
than
an
hour
to
find
the
low
narrow
window
that
slanted
down
to
the
dungeon
where
the
monsters
waited.

She
tossed
her
bundle
through
and
doubled
back
to
light
her
candle.
That
was
chancy;
the
fire
she’d
remembered
seeing
had
burnt
down
to
embers,
and
she
heard
voices
as
she
was
blowing
on
the
coals.
Cupping
her
fingers
around
the
flickering
candle,
she
went
out
the
window
as
they
were
coming
in
the
door,
without
ever
getting
a
glimpse
of
who
it
was.

This
time
the
monsters
did
not
frighten
her.
They
seemed
almost
old
friends.
Arya
held
the
candle
over
her
head.
With
each
step
she
took,
the
shadows
moved
against
the
walls,
as
if
they
were
turning
to
watch
her
pass.
“Dragons,”
she
whispered.
She
slid
Needle
out
from
under
her
cloak.
The
slender
blade
seemed
very
small
and
the
dragons
very
big,
yet
somehow
Arya
felt
better
with
steel
in
her
hand.

The
long
windowless
hall
beyond
the
door
was
as
black
as
she
remembered.
She
held
Needle
in
her
left
hand,
her
sword
hand,
the
candle
in
her
right
fist.
Hot
wax
ran
down
across
her
knuckles.
The
entrance
to
the
well
had
been
to
the
left,
so
Arya
went
right.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
run,
but
she
was
afraid
of
snuffing
out
her
candle.
She
heard
the
faint
squeaking
of
rats
and
glimpsed
a
pair
of
tiny
glowing
eyes
on
the
edge
of
the
light,
but
rats
did
not
scare
her.
Other
things
did.
It
would
be
so
easy
to
hide
here,
as
she
had
hidden
from
the
wizard
and
the
man
with
the
forked
beard.
She
could
almost
see
the
stableboy
standing
against
the
wall,
his
hands
curled
into
claws
with
the
blood
still
dripping
from
the
deep
gashes
in
his
palms
where
Needle
had
cut
him.
He
might
be
waiting
to
grab
her
as
she
passed.
He
would
see
her
candle
coming
a
long
way
off.
Maybe
she
would
be
better
off
without
the
light…

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
the
quiet
voice
inside
her
whispered.
Suddenly
Arya
remembered
the
crypts
at
Winterfell.
They
were
a
lot
scarier
than
this
place,
she
told
herself.
She’d
been
just
a
little
girl
the
first
time
she
saw
them.
Her
brother
Robb
had
taken
them
down,
her
and
Sansa
and
baby
Bran,
who’d
been
no
bigger
than
Rickon
was
now.
They’d
only
had
one
candle
between
them,
and
Bran’s
eyes
had
gotten
as
big
as
saucers
as
he
stared
at
the
stone
faces
of
the
Kings
of
Winter,
with
their
wolves
at
their
feet
and
their
iron
swords
across
their
laps.

Robb
took
them
all
the
way
down
to
the
end,
past
Grandfather
and
Brandon
and
Lyanna,
to
show
them
their
own
tombs.
Sansa
kept
looking
at
the
stubby
little
candle,
anxious
that
it
might
go
out.
Old
Nan
had
told
her
there
were
spiders
down
here,
and
rats
as
big
as
dogs.
Robb
smiled
when
she
said
that.
“There
are
worse
things
than
spiders
and
rats,”
he
whispered.
“This
is
where
the
dead
walk.”
That
was
when
they
heard
the
sound,
low
and
deep
and
shivery.
Baby
Bran
had
clutched
at
Arya’s
hand.

When
the
spirit
stepped
out
of
the
open
tomb,
pale
white
and
moaning
for
blood,
Sansa
ran
shrieking
for
the
stairs,
and
Bran
wrapped
himself
around
Robb’s
leg,
sobbing.
Arya
stood
her
ground
and
gave
the
spirit
a
punch.
It
was
only
Jon,
covered
with
flour.
“You
stupid,”
she
told
him,
“you
scared
the
baby,”
but
Jon
and
Robb
just
laughed
and
laughed,
and
pretty
soon
Bran
and
Arya
were
laughing
too.

The
memory
made
Arya
smile,
and
after
that
the
darkness
held
no
more
terrors
for
her.
The
stableboy
was
dead,
she’d
killed
him,
and
if
he
jumped
out
at
her
she’d
kill
him
again.
She
was
going
home.
Everything
would
be
better
once
she
was
home
again,
safe
behind
Winterfell’s
grey
granite
walls.

Her
footsteps
sent
soft
echoes
hurrying
ahead
of
her
as
Arya
plunged
deeper
into
the
darkness.





SANSA

They
came
for
Sansa
on
the
third
day.

She
chose
a
simple
dress
of
dark
grey
wool,
plainly
cut
but
richly
embroidered
around
the
collar
and
sleeves.
Her
fingers
felt
thick
and
clumsy
as
she
struggled
with
the
silver
fastenings
without
the
benefit
of
servants.
Jeyne
Poole
had
been
confined
with
her,
but
Jeyne
was
useless.
Her
face
was
puffy
from
all
her
crying,
and
she
could
not
seem
to
stop
sobbing
about
her
father.

“I’m
certain
your
father
is
well,”
Sansa
told
her
when
she
had
finally
gotten
the
dress
buttoned
right.
“I’ll
ask
the
queen
to
let
you
see
him.”
She
thought
that
kindness
might
lift
Jeyne’s
spirits,
but
the
other
girl
just
looked
at
her
with
red,
swollen
eyes
and
began
to
cry
all
the
harder.
She
was
such
a
child.

Sansa
had
wept
too,
the
first
day.
Even
within
the
stout
walls
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
with
her
door
closed
and
barred,
it
was
hard
not
to
be
terrified
when
the
killing
began.
She
had
grown
up
to
the
sound
of
steel
in
the
yard,
and
scarcely
a
day
of
her
life
had
passed
without
hearing
the
clash
of
sword
on
sword,
yet
somehow
knowing
that
the
fighting
was
real
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
She
heard
it
as
she
had
never
heard
it
before,
and
there
were
other
sounds
as
well,
grunts
of
pain,
angry
curses,
shouts
for
help,
and
the
moans
of
wounded
and
dying
men.
In
the
songs,
the
knights
never
screamed
nor
begged
for
mercy.

So
she
wept,
pleading
through
her
door
for
them
to
tell
her
what
was
happening,
calling
for
her
father,
for
Septa
Mordane,
for
the
king,
for
her
gallant
prince.
If
the
men
guarding
her
heard
her
pleas,
they
gave
no
answer.
The
only
time
the
door
opened
was
late
that
night,
when
they
thrust
Jeyne
Poole
inside,
bruised
and
shaking.
“They’re
killing
everyone,”
the
steward’s
daughter
had
shrieked
at
her.
She
went
on
and
on.
The
Hound
had
broken
down
her
door
with
a
warhammer,
she
said.
There
were
bodies
on
the
stair
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
and
the
steps
were
slick
with
blood.
Sansa
dried
her
own
tears
as
she
struggled
to
comfort
her
friend.
They
went
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed,
cradled
in
each
other’s
arms
like
sisters.

The
second
day
was
even
worse.
The
room
where
Sansa
had
been
confined
was
at
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
From
its
window,
she
could
see
that
the
heavy
iron
portcullis
in
the
gatehouse
was
down,
and
the
drawbridge
drawn
up
over
the
deep
dry
moat
that
separated
the
keep-within-a-keep
from
the
larger
castle
that
surrounded
it.
Lannister
guardsmen
prowled
the
walls
with
spears
and
crossbows
to
hand.
The
fighting
was
over,
and
the
silence
of
the
grave
had
settled
over
the
Red
Keep.
The
only
sounds
were
Jeyne
Poole’s
endless
whimpers
and
sobs.

They
were
fed—hard
cheese
and
fresh-baked
bread
and
milk
to
break
their
fast,
roast
chicken
and
greens
at
midday,
and
a
late
supper
of
beef
and
barley
stew—but
the
servants
who
brought
the
meals
would
not
answer
Sansa’s
questions.
That
evening,
some
women
brought
her
clothes
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
and
some
of
Jeyne’s
things
as
well,
but
they
seemed
nearly
as
frightened
as
Jeyne,
and
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
them,
they
fled
from
her
as
if
she
had
the
grey
plague.
The
guards
outside
the
door
still
refused
to
let
them
leave
the
room.

“Please,
I
need
to
speak
to
the
queen
again,”
Sansa
told
them,
as
she
told
everyone
she
saw
that
day.
“She’ll
want
to
talk
to
me,
I
know
she
will.
Tell
her
I
want
to
see
her,
please.
If
not
the
queen,
then
Prince
Joffrey,
if
you’d
be
so
kind.
We’re
to
marry
when
we’re
older.”

At
sunset
on
the
second
day,
a
great
bell
began
to
ring.
Its
voice
was
deep
and
sonorous,
and
the
long
slow
clanging
filled
Sansa
with
a
sense
of
dread.
The
ringing
went
on
and
on,
and
after
a
while
they
heard
other
bells
answering
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
Visenya’s
Hill.
The
sound
rumbled
across
the
city
like
thunder,
warning
of
the
storm
to
come.

“What
is
it?”
Jeyne
asked,
covering
her
ears.
“Why
are
they
ringing
the
bells?”

“The
king
is
dead.”
Sansa
could
not
say
how
she
knew
it,
yet
she
did.
The
slow,
endless
clanging
filled
their
room,
as
mournful
as
a
dirge.
Had
some
enemy
stormed
the
castle
and
murdered
King
Robert?
Was
that
the
meaning
of
the
fighting
they
had
heard?

She
went
to
sleep
wondering,
restless,
and
fearful.
Was
her
beautiful
Joffrey
the
king
now?
Or
had
they
killed
him
too?
She
was
afraid
for
him,
and
for
her
father.
If
only
they
would
tell
her
what
was
happening…

That
night
Sansa
dreamt
of
Joffrey
on
the
throne,
with
herself
seated
beside
him
in
a
gown
of
woven
gold.
She
had
a
crown
on
her
head,
and
everyone
she
had
ever
known
came
before
her,
to
bend
the
knee
and
say
their
courtesies.

The
next
morning,
the
morning
of
the
third
day,
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard
came
to
escort
her
to
the
queen.

Ser
Boros
was
an
ugly
man
with
a
broad
chest
and
short,
bandy
legs.
His
nose
was
flat,
his
cheeks
baggy
with
jowls,
his
hair
grey
and
brittle.
Today
he
wore
white
velvet,
and
his
snowy
cloak
was
fastened
with
a
lion
brooch.
The
beast
had
the
soft
sheen
of
gold,
and
his
eyes
were
tiny
rubies.
“You
look
very
handsome
and
splendid
this
morning,
Ser
Boros,”
Sansa
told
him.
A
lady
remembered
her
courtesies,
and
she
was
resolved
to
be
a
lady
no
matter
what.

“And
you,
my
lady,”
Ser
Boros
said
in
a
flat
voice.
“Her
Grace
awaits.
Come
with
me.”

There
were
guards
outside
her
door,
Lannister
men-at-arms
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms.
Sansa
made
herself
smile
at
them
pleasantly
and
bid
them
a
good
morning
as
she
passed.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
allowed
outside
the
chamber
since
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
had
led
her
there
two
mornings
past.
“To
keep
you
safe,
my
sweet
one,”
Queen
Cersei
had
told
her.
“Joffrey
would
never
forgive
me
if
anything
happened
to
his
precious.”

Sansa
had
expected
that
Ser
Boros
would
escort
her
to
the
royal
apartments,
but
instead
he
led
her
out
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
The
bridge
was
down
again.
Some
workmen
were
lowering
a
man
on
ropes
into
the
depths
of
the
dry
moat.
When
Sansa
peered
down,
she
saw
a
body
impaled
on
the
huge
iron
spikes
below.
She
averted
her
eyes
quickly,
afraid
to
ask,
afraid
to
look
too
long,
afraid
he
might
be
someone
she
knew.

They
found
Queen
Cersei
in
the
council
chambers,
seated
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
littered
with
papers,
candles,
and
blocks
of
sealing
wax.
The
room
was
as
splendid
as
any
that
Sansa
had
ever
seen.
She
stared
in
awe
at
the
carved
wooden
screen
and
the
twin
sphinxes
that
sat
beside
the
door.

“Your
Grace,”
Ser
Boros
said
when
they
were
ushered
inside
by
another
of
the
Kingsguard,
Ser
Mandon
of
the
curiously
dead
face,
“I’ve
brought
the
girl.”

Sansa
had
hoped
Joffrey
might
be
with
her.
Her
prince
was
not
there,
but
three
of
the
king’s
councillors
were.
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
sat
on
the
queen’s
left
hand,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
at
the
end
of
the
table,
while
Lord
Varys
hovered
over
them,
smelling
flowery.
All
of
them
were
clad
in
black,
she
realized
with
a
feeling
of
dread.
Mourning
clothes…

The
queen
wore
a
high-collared
black
silk
gown,
with
a
hundred
dark
red
rubies
sewn
into
her
bodice,
covering
her
from
neck
to
bosom.
They
were
cut
in
the
shape
of
teardrops,
as
if
the
queen
were
weeping
blood.
Cersei
smiled
to
see
her,
and
Sansa
thought
it
was
the
sweetest
and
saddest
smile
she
had
ever
seen.
“Sansa,
my
sweet
child,”
she
said,
“I
know
you’ve
been
asking
for
me.
I’m
sorry
that
I
could
not
send
for
you
sooner.
Matters
have
been
very
unsettled,
and
I
have
not
had
a
moment.
I
trust
my
people
have
been
taking
good
care
of
you?”

“Everyone
has
been
very
sweet
and
pleasant,
Your
Grace,
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
asking,”
Sansa
said
politely.
“Only,
well,
no
one
will
talk
to
us
or
tell
us
what’s
happened…”

“Us?”
Cersei
seemed
puzzled.

“We
put
the
steward’s
girl
in
with
her,”
Ser
Boros
said.
“We
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
her.”

The
queen
frowned.
“Next
time,
you
will
ask,”
she
said,
her
voice
sharp.
“The
gods
only
know
what
sort
of
tales
she’s
been
filling
Sansa’s
head
with.”

“Jeyne’s
scared,”
Sansa
said.
“She
won’t
stop
crying.
I
promised
her
I’d
ask
if
she
could
see
her
father.”

Old
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lowered
his
eyes.

“Her
father
is
well,
isn’t
he?”
Sansa
said
anxiously.
She
knew
there
had
been
fighting,
but
surely
no
one
would
harm
a
steward.
Vayon
Poole
did
not
even
wear
a
sword.

Queen
Cersei
looked
at
each
of
the
councillors
in
turn.
“I
won’t
have
Sansa
fretting
needlessly.
What
shall
we
do
with
this
little
friend
of
hers,
my
lords?”

Lord
Petyr
leaned
forward.
“I’ll
find
a
place
for
her.”

“Not
in
the
city,”
said
the
queen.

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?”

The
queen
ignored
that.
“Ser
Boros,
escort
this
girl
to
Lord
Petyr’s
apartments
and
instruct
his
people
to
keep
her
there
until
he
comes
for
her.
Tell
her
that
Littlefinger
will
be
taking
her
to
see
her
father,
that
ought
to
calm
her
down.
I
want
her
gone
before
Sansa
returns
to
her
chamber.”

“As
you
command,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Boros
said.
He
bowed
deeply,
spun
on
his
heel,
and
took
his
leave,
his
long
white
cloak
stirring
the
air
behind
him.

Sansa
was
confused.
“I
don’t
understand,”
she
said.
“Where
is
Jeyne’s
father?
Why
can’t
Ser
Boros
take
her
to
him
instead
of
Lord
Petyr
having
to
do
it?”
She
had
promised
herself
she
would
be
a
lady,
gentle
as
the
queen
and
as
strong
as
her
mother,
the
Lady
Catelyn,
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
scared
again.
For
a
second
she
thought
she
might
cry.
“Where
are
you
sending
her?
She
hasn’t
done
anything
wrong,
she’s
a
good
girl.”

“She’s
upset
you,”
the
queen
said
gently.
“We
can’t
be
having
that.
Not
another
word,
now.
Lord
Baelish
will
see
that
Jeyne’s
well
taken
care
of,
I
promise
you.”
She
patted
the
chair
beside
her.
“Sit
down,
Sansa.
I
want
to
talk
to
you.”

Sansa
seated
herself
beside
the
queen.
Cersei
smiled
again,
but
that
did
not
make
her
feel
any
less
anxious.
Varys
was
wringing
his
soft
hands
together,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
kept
his
sleepy
eyes
on
the
papers
in
front
of
him,
but
she
could
feel
Littlefinger
staring.
Something
about
the
way
the
small
man
looked
at
her
made
Sansa
feel
as
though
she
had
no
clothes
on.
Goose
bumps
pimpled
her
skin.

“Sweet
Sansa,”
Queen
Cersei
said,
laying
a
soft
hand
on
her
wrist.
“Such
a
beautiful
child.
I
do
hope
you
know
how
much
Joffrey
and
I
love
you.”

“You
do?”
Sansa
said,
breathless.
Littlefinger
was
forgotten.
Her
prince
loved
her.
Nothing
else
mattered.

The
queen
smiled.
“I
think
of
you
almost
as
my
own
daughter.
And
I
know
the
love
you
bear
for
Joffrey.”
She
gave
a
weary
shake
of
her
head.
“I
am
afraid
we
have
some
grave
news
about
your
lord
father.
You
must
be
brave,
child.”

Her
quiet
words
gave
Sansa
a
chill.
“What
is
it?”

“Your
father
is
a
traitor,
dear,”
Lord
Varys
said.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lifted
his
ancient
head.
“With
my
own
ears,
I
heard
Lord
Eddard
swear
to
our
beloved
King
Robert
that
he
would
protect
the
young
princes
as
if
they
were
his
own
sons.
And
yet
the
moment
the
king
was
dead,
he
called
the
small
council
together
to
steal
Prince
Joffrey’s
rightful
throne.”

“No,”
Sansa
blurted.
“He
wouldn’t
do
that.
He
wouldn’t!”

The
queen
picked
up
a
letter.
The
paper
was
torn
and
stiff
with
dried
blood,
but
the
broken
seal
was
her
father’s,
the
direwolf
stamped
in
pale
wax.
“We
found
this
on
the
captain
of
your
household
guard,
Sansa.
It
is
a
letter
to
my
late
husband’s
brother
Stannis,
inviting
him
to
take
the
crown.”

“Please,
Your
Grace,
there’s
been
a
mistake.”
Sudden
panic
made
her
dizzy
and
faint.
“Please,
send
for
my
father,
he’ll
tell
you,
he
would
never
write
such
a
letter,
the
king
was
his
friend.”

“Robert
thought
so,”
said
the
queen.
“This
betrayal
would
have
broken
his
heart.
The
gods
are
kind,
that
he
did
not
live
to
see
it.”
She
sighed.
“Sansa,
sweetling,
you
must
see
what
a
dreadful
position
this
has
left
us
in.
You
are
innocent
of
any
wrong,
we
all
know
that,
and
yet
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
traitor.
How
can
I
allow
you
to
marry
my
son?”

“But
I
love
him,”
Sansa
wailed,
confused
and
frightened.
What
did
they
mean
to
do
to
her?
What
had
they
done
to
her
father?
It
was
not
supposed
to
happen
this
way.
She
had
to
wed
Joffrey,
they
were
betrothed,
he
was
promised
to
her,
she
had
even
dreamed
about
it.
It
wasn’t
fair
to
take
him
away
from
her
on
account
of
whatever
her
father
might
have
done.

“How
well
I
know
that,
child,”
Cersei
said,
her
voice
so
kind
and
sweet.
“Why
else
should
you
have
come
to
me
and
told
me
of
your
father’s
plan
to
send
you
away
from
us,
if
not
for
love?”

“It
was
for
love,”
Sansa
said
in
a
rush.
“Father
wouldn’t
even
give
me
leave
to
say
farewell.”
She
was
the
good
girl,
the
obedient
girl,
but
she
had
felt
as
wicked
as
Arya
that
morning,
sneaking
away
from
Septa
Mordane,
defying
her
lord
father.
She
had
never
done
anything
so
willful
before,
and
she
would
never
have
done
it
then
if
she
hadn’t
loved
Joffrey
as
much
as
she
did.
“He
was
going
to
take
me
back
to
Winterfell
and
marry
me
to
some
hedge
knight,
even
though
it
was
Joff
I
wanted.
I
told
him,
but
he
wouldn’t
listen.”
The
king
had
been
her
last
hope.
The
king
could
command
Father
to
let
her
stay
in
King’s
Landing
and
marry
Prince
Joffrey,
Sansa
knew
he
could,
but
the
king
had
always
frightened
her.
He
was
loud
and
rough-voiced
and
drunk
as
often
as
not,
and
he
would
probably
have
just
sent
her
back
to
Lord
Eddard,
if
they
even
let
her
see
him.
So
she
went
to
the
queen
instead,
and
poured
out
her
heart,
and
Cersei
had
listened
and
thanked
her
sweetly…
only
then
Ser
Arys
had
escorted
her
to
the
high
room
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast
and
posted
guards,
and
a
few
hours
later,
the
fighting
had
begun
outside.
“Please,”
she
finished,
“you
have
to
let
me
marry
Joffrey,
I’ll
be
ever
so
good
a
wife
to
him,
you’ll
see.
I’ll
be
a
queen
just
like
you,
I
promise.”

Queen
Cersei
looked
to
the
others.
“My
lords
of
the
council,
what
do
you
say
to
her
plea?”

“The
poor
child,”
murmured
Varys.
“A
love
so
true
and
innocent,
Your
Grace,
it
would
be
cruel
to
deny
it…
and
yet,
what
can
we
do?
Her
father
stands
condemned.”
His
soft
hands
washed
each
other
in
a
gesture
of
helpless
distress.

“A
child
born
of
traitor’s
seed
will
find
that
betrayal
comes
naturally
to
her,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“She
is
a
sweet
thing
now,
but
in
ten
years,
who
can
say
what
treasons
she
may
hatch?”

“No,”
Sansa
said,
horrified.
“I’m
not,
I’d
never…
I
wouldn’t
betray
Joffrey,
I
love
him,
I
swear
it,
I
do.”

“Oh,
so
poignant,”
said
Varys.
“And
yet,
it
is
truly
said
that
blood
runs
truer
than
oaths.”

“She
reminds
me
of
the
mother,
not
the
father,”
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
said
quietly.
“Look
at
her.
The
hair,
the
eyes.
She
is
the
very
image
of
Cat
at
the
same
age.”

The
queen
looked
at
her,
troubled,
and
yet
Sansa
could
see
kindness
in
her
clear
green
eyes.
“Child,”
she
said,
“if
I
could
truly
believe
that
you
were
not
like
your
father,
why
nothing
should
please
me
more
than
to
see
you
wed
to
my
Joffrey.
I
know
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart.”
She
sighed.
“And
yet,
I
fear
that
Lord
Varys
and
the
Grand
Maester
have
the
right
of
it.
The
blood
will
tell.
I
have
only
to
remember
how
your
sister
set
her
wolf
on
my
son.”

“I’m
not
like
Arya,”
Sansa
blurted.
“She
has
the
traitor’s
blood,
not
me.
I’m
good,
ask
Septa
Mordane,
she’ll
tell
you,
I
only
want
to
be
Joffrey’s
loyal
and
loving
wife.”

She
felt
the
weight
of
Cersei’s
eyes
as
the
queen
studied
her
face.
“I
believe
you
mean
it,
child.”
She
turned
to
face
the
others.
“My
lords,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
rest
of
her
kin
were
to
remain
loyal
in
this
terrible
time,
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
laying
our
fears
to
rest.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stroked
his
huge
soft
beard,
his
wide
brow
furrowed
in
thought.
“Lord
Eddard
has
three
sons.”

“Mere
boys,”
Lord
Petyr
said
with
a
shrug.
“I
should
be
more
concerned
with
Lady
Catelyn
and
the
Tullys.”

The
queen
took
Sansa’s
hand
in
both
of
hers.
“Child,
do
you
know
your
letters?”

Sansa
nodded
nervously.
She
could
read
and
write
better
than
any
of
her
brothers,
although
she
was
hopeless
at
sums.

“I
am
pleased
to
hear
that.
Perhaps
there
is
hope
for
you
and
Joffrey
still…”

“What
do
you
want
me
to
do?”

“You
must
write
your
lady
mother,
and
your
brother,
the
eldest…
what
is
his
name?”

“Robb,”
Sansa
said.

“The
word
of
your
lord
father’s
treason
will
no
doubt
reach
them
soon.
Better
that
it
should
come
from
you.
You
must
tell
them
how
Lord
Eddard
betrayed
his
king.”

Sansa
wanted
Joffrey
desperately,
but
she
did
not
think
she
had
the
courage
to
do
as
the
queen
was
asking.
“But
he
never…
I
don’t…
Your
Grace,
I
wouldn’t
know
what
to
say…”

The
queen
patted
her
hand.
“We
will
tell
you
what
to
write,
child.
The
important
thing
is
that
you
urge
Lady
Catelyn
and
your
brother
to
keep
the
king’s
peace.”

“It
will
go
hard
for
them
if
they
don’t,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“By
the
love
you
bear
them,
you
must
urge
them
to
walk
the
path
of
wisdom.”

“Your
lady
mother
will
no
doubt
fear
for
you
dreadfully,”
the
queen
said.
“You
must
tell
her
that
you
are
well
and
in
our
care,
that
we
are
treating
you
gently
and
seeing
to
your
every
want.
Bid
them
to
come
to
King’s
Landing
and
pledge
their
fealty
to
Joffrey
when
he
takes
his
throne.
If
they
do
that…
why,
then
we
shall
know
that
there
is
no
taint
in
your
blood,
and
when
you
come
into
the
flower
of
your
womanhood,
you
shall
wed
the
king
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
before
the
eyes
of
gods
and
men.”

…wed
the
king…
The
words
made
her
breath
come
faster,
yet
still
Sansa
hesitated.
“Perhaps…
if
I
might
see
my
father,
talk
to
him
about…”

“Treason?”
Lord
Varys
hinted.

“You
disappoint
me,
Sansa,”
the
queen
said,
with
eyes
gone
hard
as
stones.
“We’ve
told
you
of
your
father’s
crimes.
If
you
are
truly
as
loyal
as
you
say,
why
should
you
want
to
see
him?”

“I…
I
only
meant…”
Sansa
felt
her
eyes
grow
wet.
“He’s
not…
please,
he
hasn’t
been…
hurt,
or…
or…”

“Lord
Eddard
has
not
been
harmed,”
the
queen
said.

“But…
what’s
to
become
of
him?”

“That
is
a
matter
for
the
king
to
decide,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
announced
ponderously.

The
king!
Sansa
blinked
back
her
tears.
Joffrey
was
the
king
now,
she
thought.
Her
gallant
prince
would
never
hurt
her
father,
no
matter
what
he
might
have
done.
If
she
went
to
him
and
pleaded
for
mercy,
she
was
certain
he’d
listen.
He
had
to
listen,
he
loved
her,
even
the
queen
said
so.
Joff
would
need
to
punish
Father,
the
lords
would
expect
it,
but
perhaps
he
could
send
him
back
to
Winterfell,
or
exile
him
to
one
of
the
Free
Cities
across
the
narrow
sea.
It
would
only
have
to
be
for
a
few
years.
By
then
she
and
Joffrey
would
be
married.
Once
she
was
queen,
she
could
persuade
Joff
to
bring
Father
back
and
grant
him
a
pardon.

Only…
if
Mother
or
Robb
did
anything
treasonous,
called
the
banners
or
refused
to
swear
fealty
or
anything,
it
would
all
go
wrong.
Her
Joffrey
was
good
and
kind,
she
knew
it
in
her
heart,
but
a
king
had
to
be
stern
with
rebels.
She
had
to
make
them
understand,
she
had
to!

“I’ll…
I’ll
write
the
letters,”
Sansa
told
them.

With
a
smile
as
warm
as
the
sunrise,
Cersei
Lannister
leaned
close
and
kissed
her
gently
on
the
cheek.
“I
knew
you
would.
Joffrey
will
be
so
proud
when
I
tell
him
what
courage
and
good
sense
you’ve
shown
here
today.”

In
the
end,
she
wrote
four
letters.
To
her
mother,
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark,
and
to
her
brothers
at
Winterfell,
and
to
her
aunt
and
her
grandfather
as
well,
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
of
the
Eyrie,
and
Lord
Hoster
Tully
of
Riverrun.
By
the
time
she
had
done,
her
fingers
were
cramped
and
stiff
and
stained
with
ink.
Varys
had
her
father’s
seal.
She
warmed
the
pale
white
beeswax
over
a
candle,
poured
it
carefully,
and
watched
as
the
eunuch
stamped
each
letter
with
the
direwolf
of
House
Stark.

Jeyne
Poole
and
all
her
things
were
gone
when
Ser
Mandon
Moore
returned
Sansa
to
the
high
tower
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
No
more
weeping,
she
thought
gratefully.
Yet
somehow
it
seemed
colder
with
Jeyne
gone,
even
after
she’d
built
a
fire.
She
pulled
a
chair
close
to
the
hearth,
took
down
one
of
her
favorite
books,
and
lost
herself
in
the
stories
of
Florian
and
Jonquil,
of
Lady
Shella
and
the
Rainbow
Knight,
of
valiant
Prince
Aemon
and
his
doomed
love
for
his
brother’s
queen.

It
was
not
until
later
that
night,
as
she
was
drifting
off
to
sleep,
that
Sansa
realized
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
about
her
sister.





JON

“Othor,”
announced
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
“beyond
a
doubt.
And
this
one
was
Jafer
Flowers.”
He
turned
the
corpse
over
with
his
foot,
and
the
dead
white
face
stared
up
at
the
overcast
sky
with
blue,
blue
eyes.
“They
were
Ben
Stark’s
men,
both
of
them.”

My
uncle’s
men,
Jon
thought
numbly.
He
remembered
how
he’d
pleaded
to
ride
with
them.
Gods,
I
was
such
a
green
boy.
If
he
had
taken
me,
it
might
be
me
lying
here…

Jafer’s
right
wrist
ended
in
the
ruin
of
torn
flesh
and
splintered
bone
left
by
Ghost’s
jaws.
His
right
hand
was
floating
in
a
jar
of
vinegar
back
in
Maester
Aemon’s
tower.
His
left
hand,
still
at
the
end
of
his
arm,
was
as
black
as
his
cloak.

“Gods
have
mercy,”
the
Old
Bear
muttered.
He
swung
down
from
his
garron,
handing
his
reins
to
Jon.
The
morning
was
unnaturally
warm;
beads
of
sweat
dotted
the
Lord
Commander’s
broad
forehead
like
dew
on
a
melon.
His
horse
was
nervous,
rolling
her
eyes,
backing
away
from
the
dead
men
as
far
as
her
lead
would
allow.
Jon
led
her
off
a
few
paces,
fighting
to
keep
her
from
bolting.
The
horses
did
not
like
the
feel
of
this
place.
For
that
matter,
neither
did
Jon.

The
dogs
liked
it
least
of
all.
Ghost
had
led
the
party
here;
the
pack
of
hounds
had
been
useless.
When
Bass
the
kennelmaster
had
tried
to
get
them
to
take
the
scent
from
the
severed
hand,
they
had
gone
wild,
yowling
and
barking,
fighting
to
get
away.
Even
now
they
were
snarling
and
whimpering
by
turns,
pulling
at
their
leashes
while
Chett
cursed
them
for
curs.

It
is
only
a
wood,
Jon
told
himself,
and
they’re
only
dead
men.
He
had
seen
dead
men
before…

Last
night
he
had
dreamt
the
Winterfell
dream
again.
He
was
wandering
the
empty
castle,
searching
for
his
father,
descending
into
the
crypts.
Only
this
time
the
dream
had
gone
further
than
before.
In
the
dark
he’d
heard
the
scrape
of
stone
on
stone.
When
he
turned
he
saw
that
the
vaults
were
opening,
one
after
the
other.
As
the
dead
kings
came
stumbling
from
their
cold
black
graves,
Jon
had
woken
in
pitch-dark,
his
heart
hammering.
Even
when
Ghost
leapt
up
on
the
bed
to
nuzzle
at
his
face,
he
could
not
shake
his
deep
sense
of
terror.
He
dared
not
go
back
to
sleep.
Instead
he
had
climbed
the
Wall
and
walked,
restless,
until
he
saw
the
light
of
the
dawn
off
to
the
cast.
It
was
only
a
dream.
I
am
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
now,
not
a
frightened
boy.

Samwell
Tarly
huddled
beneath
the
trees,
half-hidden
behind
the
horses.
His
round
fat
face
was
the
color
of
curdled
milk.
So
far
he
had
not
lurched
off
to
the
woods
to
retch,
but
he
had
not
so
much
as
glanced
at
the
dead
men
either.
“I
can’t
look,”
he
whispered
miserably.

“You
have
to
look,”
Jon
told
him,
keeping
his
voice
low
so
the
others
would
not
hear.
“Maester
Aemon
sent
you
to
be
his
eyes,
didn’t
he?
What
good
are
eyes
if
they’re
shut?”

“Yes,
but…
I’m
such
a
coward,
Jon.”

Jon
put
a
hand
on
Sam’s
shoulder.
“We
have
a
dozen
rangers
with
us,
and
the
dogs,
even
Ghost.
No
one
will
hurt
you,
Sam.
Go
ahead
and
look.
The
first
look
is
the
hardest.”

Sam
gave
a
tremulous
nod,
working
up
his
courage
with
a
visible
effort.
Slowly
he
swiveled
his
head.
His
eyes
widened,
but
Jon
held
his
arm
so
he
could
not
turn
away.

“Ser
Jaremy,”
the
Old
Bear
asked
gruffly,
“Ben
Stark
had
six
men
with
him
when
he
rode
from
the
Wall.
Where
are
the
others?”

Ser
Jaremy
shook
his
head.
“Would
that
I
knew.”

Plainly
Mormont
was
not
pleased
with
that
answer.
“Two
of
our
brothers
butchered
almost
within
sight
of
the
Wall,
yet
your
rangers
heard
nothing,
saw
nothing.
Is
this
what
the
Night’s
Watch
has
fallen
to?
Do
we
still
sweep
these
woods?”

“Yes,
my
lord,
but—”

“Do
we
still
mount
watches?”

“We
do,
but—”

“This
man
wears
a
hunting
horn.”
Mormont
pointed
at
Othor.
“Must
I
suppose
that
he
died
without
sounding
it?
Or
have
your
rangers
all
gone
deaf
as
well
as
blind?”

Ser
Jaremy
bristled,
his
face
taut
with
anger.
“No
horn
was
blown,
my
lord,
or
my
rangers
would
have
heard
it.
I
do
not
have
sufficient
men
to
mount
as
many
patrols
as
I
should
like…
and
since
Benjen
was
lost,
we
have
stayed
closer
to
the
Wall
than
we
were
wont
to
do
before,
by
your
own
command.”

The
Old
Bear
grunted.
“Yes.
Well.
Be
that
as
it
may.”
He
made
an
impatient
gesture.
“Tell
me
how
they
died.”

Squatting
beside
the
dead
man
he
had
named
Jafer
Flowers,
Ser
Jaremy
grasped
his
head
by
the
scalp.
The
hair
came
out
between
his
fingers,
brittle
as
straw.
The
knight
cursed
and
shoved
at
the
face
with
the
heel
of
his
hand.
A
great
gash
in
the
side
of
the
corpse’s
neck
opened
like
a
mouth,
crusted
with
dried
blood.
Only
a
few
ropes
of
pale
tendon
still
attached
the
head
to
the
neck.
“This
was
done
with
an
axe.”

“Aye,”
muttered
Dywen,
the
old
forester.
“Belike
the
axe
that
Othor
carried,
m’lord.”

Jon
could
feel
his
breakfast
churning
in
his
belly,
but
he
pressed
his
lips
together
and
made
himself
look
at
the
second
body.
Othor
had
been
a
big
ugly
man,
and
he
made
a
big
ugly
corpse.
No
axe
was
in
evidence.
Jon
remembered
Othor;
he
had
been
the
one
bellowing
the
bawdy
song
as
the
rangers
rode
out.
His
singing
days
were
done.
His
flesh
was
blanched
white
as
milk,
everywhere
but
his
hands.
His
hands
were
black
like
Jafer’s.
Blossoms
of
hard
cracked
blood
decorated
the
mortal
wounds
that
covered
him
like
a
rash,
breast
and
groin
and
throat.
Yet
his
eyes
were
still
open.
They
stared
up
at
the
sky,
blue
as
sapphires.

Ser
Jaremy
stood.
“The
wildlings
have
axes
too.”

Mormont
rounded
on
him.
“So
you
believe
this
is
Mance
Rayder’s
work?
This
close
to
the
Wall?”

“Who
else,
my
lord?”

Jon
could
have
told
him.
He
knew,
they
all
knew,
yet
no
man
of
them
would
say
the
words.
The
Others
are
only
a
story,
a
tale
to
make
children
shiver.
If
they
ever
lived
at
all,
they
are
gone
eight
thousand
years.
Even
the
thought
made
him
feel
foolish;
he
was
a
man
grown
now,
a
black
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
not
the
boy
who’d
once
sat
at
Old
Nan’s
feet
with
Bran
and
Robb
and
Arya.

Yet
Lord
Commander
Mormont
gave
a
snort.
“If
Ben
Stark
had
come
under
wildling
attack
a
half
day’s
ride
from
Castle
Black,
he
would
have
returned
for
more
men,
chased
the
killers
through
all
seven
hells
and
brought
me
back
their
heads.”

“Unless
he
was
slain
as
well,”
Ser
Jaremy
insisted.

The
words
hurt,
even
now.
It
had
been
so
long,
it
seemed
folly
to
cling
to
the
hope
that
Ben
Stark
was
still
alive,
but
Jon
Snow
was
nothing
if
not
stubborn.

“It
has
been
close
on
half
a
year
since
Benjen
left
us,
my
lord,”
Ser
Jaremy
went
on.
“The
forest
is
vast.
The
wildlings
might
have
fallen
on
him
anywhere.
I’d
wager
these
two
were
the
last
survivors
of
his
party,
on
their
way
back
to
us…
but
the
enemy
caught
them
before
they
could
reach
the
safety
of
the
Wall.
The
corpses
are
still
fresh,
these
men
cannot
have
been
dead
more
than
a
day…”

“No,”
Samwell
Tarly
squeaked.

Jon
was
startled.
Sam’s
nervous,
high-pitched
voice
was
the
last
he
would
have
expected
to
hear.
The
fat
boy
was
frightened
of
the
officers,
and
Ser
Jaremy
was
not
known
for
his
patience.

“I
did
not
ask
for
your
views,
boy,”
Rykker
said
coldly.

“Let
him
speak,
ser,”
Jon
blurted.

Mormont’s
eyes
flicked
from
Sam
to
Jon
and
back
again.
“If
the
lad
has
something
to
say,
I’ll
hear
him
out.
Come
closer,
boy.
We
can’t
see
you
behind
those
horses.”

Sam
edged
past
Jon
and
the
garrons,
sweating
profusely.
“My
lord,
it…
it
can’t
be
a
day
or…
look…
the
blood…”

“Yes?”
Mormont
growled
impatiently.
“Blood,
what
of
it?”

“He
soils
his
smallclothes
at
the
sight
of
it,”
Chett
shouted
out,
and
the
rangers
laughed.

Sam
mopped
at
the
sweat
on
his
brow.
“You…
you
can
see
where
Ghost…
Jon’s
direwolf…
you
can
see
where
he
tore
off
that
man’s
hand,
and
yet…
the
stump
hasn’t
bled,
look…”
He
waved
a
hand.
“My
father…
L-lord
Randyll,
he,
he
made
me
watch
him
dress
animals
sometimes,
when…
after…”
Sam
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side,
his
chins
quivering.
Now
that
he
had
looked
at
the
bodies,
he
could
not
seem
to
look
away.
“A
fresh
kill…
the
blood
would
still
flow,
my
lords.
Later…
later
it
would
be
clotted,
like
a…
a
jelly,
thick
and…
and…”
He
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
be
sick.
“This
man…
look
at
the
wrist,
it’s
all…
crusty…
dry…
like…”

Jon
saw
at
once
what
Sam
meant.
He
could
see
the
torn
veins
in
the
dead
man’s
wrist,
iron
worms
in
the
pale
flesh.
His
blood
was
a
black
dust.
Yet
Jaremy
Rykker
was
unconvinced.
“If
they’d
been
dead
much
longer
than
a
day,
they’d
be
ripe
by
now,
boy.
They
don’t
even
smell.”

Dywen,
the
gnarled
old
forester
who
liked
to
boast
that
he
could
smell
snow
coming
on,
sidled
closer
to
the
corpses
and
took
a
whiff.
“Well,
they’re
no
pansy
flowers,
but…
m’lord
has
the
truth
of
it.
There’s
no
corpse
stink.”

“They…
they
aren’t
rotting.”
Sam
pointed,
his
fat
finger
shaking
only
a
little.
“Look,
there’s…
there’s
no
maggots
or…
or…
worms
or
anything…
they’ve
been
lying
here
in
the
woods,
but
they…
they
haven’t
been
chewed
or
eaten
by
animals…
only
Ghost…
otherwise
they’re…
they’re…”

“Untouched,”
Jon
said
softly.
“And
Ghost
is
different.
The
dogs
and
the
horses
won’t
go
near
them.”

The
rangers
exchanged
glances;
they
could
see
it
was
true,
every
man
of
them.
Mormont
frowned,
glancing
from
the
corpses
to
the
dogs.
“Chett,
bring
the
hounds
closer.”

Chett
tried,
cursing,
yanking
on
the
leashes,
giving
one
animal
a
lick
of
his
boot.
Most
of
the
dogs
just
whimpered
and
planted
their
feet.
He
tried
dragging
one.
The
bitch
resisted,
growling
and
squirming
as
if
to
escape
her
collar.
Finally
she
lunged
at
him.
Chett
dropped
the
leash
and
stumbled
backward.
The
dog
leapt
over
him
and
bounded
off
into
the
trees.

“This…
this
is
all
wrong,”
Sam
Tarly
said
earnestly.
“The
blood…
there’s
bloodstains
on
their
clothes,
and…
and
their
flesh,
dry
and
hard,
but…
there’s
none
on
the
ground,
or…
anywhere.
With
those…
those…
those…”
Sam
made
himself
swallow,
took
a
deep
breath.
“With
those
wounds…
terrible
wounds…
there
should
be
blood
all
over.
Shouldn’t
there?”

Dywen
sucked
at
his
wooden
teeth.
“Might
be
they
didn’t
die
here.
Might
be
someone
brought
’em
and
left
’em
for
us.
A
warning,
as
like.”
The
old
forester
peered
down
suspiciously.
“And
might
be
I’m
a
fool,
but
I
don’t
know
that
Othor
never
had
no
blue
eyes
afore.”

Ser
Jaremy
looked
startled.
“Neither
did
Flowers,”
he
blurted,
turning
to
stare
at
the
dead
man.

A
silence
fell
over
the
wood.
For
a
moment
all
they
heard
was
Sam’s
heavy
breathing
and
the
wet
sound
of
Dywen
sucking
on
his
teeth.
Jon
squatted
beside
Ghost.

“Burn
them,”
someone
whispered.
One
of
the
rangers;
Jon
could
not
have
said
who.
“Yes,
burn
them,”
a
second
voice
urged.

The
Old
Bear
gave
a
stubborn
shake
of
his
head.
“Not
yet.
I
want
Maester
Aemon
to
have
a
look
at
them.
We’ll
bring
them
back
to
the
Wall.”

Some
commands
are
more
easily
given
than
obeyed.
They
wrapped
the
dead
men
in
cloaks,
but
when
Hake
and
Dywen
tried
to
tie
one
onto
a
horse,
the
animal
went
mad,
screaming
and
rearing,
lashing
out
with
its
hooves,
even
biting
at
Ketter
when
he
ran
to
help.
The
rangers
had
no
better
luck
with
the
other
garrons;
not
even
the
most
placid
wanted
any
part
of
these
burdens.
In
the
end
they
were
forced
to
hack
off
branches
and
fashion
crude
slings
to
carry
the
corpses
back
on
foot.
It
was
well
past
midday
by
the
time
they
started
back.

“I
will
have
these
woods
searched,”
Mormont
commanded
Ser
Jaremy
as
they
set
out.
“Every
tree,
every
rock,
every
bush,
and
every
foot
of
muddy
ground
within
ten
leagues
of
here.
Use
all
the
men
you
have,
and
if
you
do
not
have
enough,
borrow
hunters
and
foresters
from
the
stewards.
If
Ben
and
the
others
are
out
here,
dead
or
alive,
I
will
have
them
found.
And
if
there
is
anyone
else
in
these
woods,
I
will
know
of
it.
You
are
to
track
them
and
take
them,
alive
if
possible.
Is
that
understood?”

“It
is,
my
lord,”
Ser
Jaremy
said.
“It
will
be
done.”

After
that,
Mormont
rode
in
silence,
brooding.
Jon
followed
close
behind
him;
as
the
Lord
Commander’s
steward,
that
was
his
place.
The
day
was
grey,
damp,
overcast,
the
sort
of
day
that
made
you
wish
for
rain.
No
wind
stirred
the
wood;
the
air
hung
humid
and
heavy,
and
Jon’s
clothes
clung
to
his
skin.
It
was
warm.
Too
warm.
The
Wall
was
weeping
copiously,
had
been
weeping
for
days,
and
sometimes
Jon
even
imagined
it
was
shrinking.

The
old
men
called
this
weather
spirit
summer,
and
said
it
meant
the
season
was
giving
up
its
ghosts
at
last.
After
this
the
cold
would
come,
they
warned,
and
a
long
summer
always
meant
a
long
winter.
This
summer
had
lasted
ten
years.
Jon
had
been
a
babe
in
arms
when
it
began.

Ghost
ran
with
them
for
a
time
and
then
vanished
among
the
trees.
Without
the
direwolf,
Jon
felt
almost
naked.
He
found
himself
glancing
at
every
shadow
with
unease.
Unbidden,
he
thought
back
on
the
tales
that
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
them,
when
he
was
a
boy
at
Winterfell.
He
could
almost
hear
her
voice
again,
and
the
click-click-click
of
her
needles.
In
that
darkness,
the
Others
came
riding,
she
used
to
say,
dropping
her
voice
lower
and
lower.
Cold
and
dead
they
were,
and
they
hated
iron
and
fire
and
the
touch
of
the
sun,
and
every
living
creature
with
hot
blood
in
its
veins.
Holdfasts
and
cities
and
kingdoms
of
men
all
fell
before
them,
as
they
moved
south
on
pale
dead
horses,
leading
hosts
of
the
slain.
They
fed
their
dead
servants
on
the
flesh
of
human
children…

When
he
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
the
Wall
looming
above
the
tops
of
an
ancient
gnarled
oak,
Jon
was
vastly
relieved.
Mormont
reined
up
suddenly
and
turned
in
his
saddle.
“Tarly,”
he
barked,
“come
here.”

Jon
saw
the
start
of
fright
on
Sam’s
face
as
he
lumbered
up
on
his
mare;
doubtless
he
thought
he
was
in
trouble.
“You’re
fat
but
you’re
not
stupid,
boy,”
the
Old
Bear
said
gruffly.
“You
did
well
back
there.
And
you,
Snow.”

Sam
blushed
a
vivid
crimson
and
tripped
over
his
own
tongue
as
he
tried
to
stammer
out
a
courtesy.
Jon
had
to
smile.

When
they
emerged
from
under
the
trees,
Mormont
spurred
his
tough
little
garron
to
a
trot.
Ghost
came
streaking
out
from
the
woods
to
meet
them,
licking
his
chops,
his
muzzle
red
from
prey.
High
above,
the
men
on
the
Wall
saw
the
column
approaching.
Jon
heard
the
deep,
throaty
call
of
the
watchman’s
great
horn,
calling
out
across
the
miles;
a
single
long
blast
that
shuddered
through
the
trees
and
echoed
off
the
ice.

UUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo.

The
sound
faded
slowly
to
silence.
One
blast
meant
rangers
returning,
and
Jon
thought,
I
was
a
ranger
for
one
day,
at
least.
Whatever
may
come,
they
cannot
take
that
away
from
me.

Bowen
Marsh
was
waiting
at
the
first
gate
as
they
led
their
garrons
through
the
icy
tunnel.
The
Lord
Steward
was
red-faced
and
agitated.
“My
lord,”
he
blurted
at
Mormont
as
he
swung
open
the
iron
bars,
“there’s
been
a
bird,
you
must
come
at
once.”

“What
is
it,
man?”
Mormont
said
gruffly.

Curiously,
Marsh
glanced
at
Jon
before
he
answered.
“Maester
Aemon
has
the
letter.
He’s
waiting
in
your
solar.”

“Very
well.
Jon,
see
to
my
horse,
and
tell
Ser
Jaremy
to
put
the
dead
men
in
a
storeroom
until
the
maester
is
ready
for
them.”
Mormont
strode
away
grumbling.

As
they
led
their
horses
back
to
the
stable,
Jon
was
uncomfortably
aware
that
people
were
watching
him.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
drilling
his
boys
in
the
yard,
but
he
broke
off
to
stare
at
Jon,
a
faint
half
smile
on
his
lips.
One-armed
Donal
Noye
stood
in
the
door
of
the
armory.
“The
gods
be
with
you,
Snow,”
he
called
out.

Something’s
wrong,
Jon
thought.
Something’s
very
wrong.

The
dead
men
were
carried
to
one
of
the
storerooms
along
the
base
of
the
Wall,
a
dark
cold
cell
chiseled
from
the
ice
and
used
to
keep
meat
and
grain
and
sometimes
even
beer.
Jon
saw
that
Mormont’s
horse
was
fed
and
watered
and
groomed
before
he
took
care
of
his
own.
Afterward
he
sought
out
his
friends.
Grenn
and
Toad
were
on
watch,
but
he
found
Pyp
in
the
common
hall.
“What’s
happened?”
he
asked.

Pyp
lowered
his
voice.
“The
king’s
dead.”

Jon
was
stunned.
Robert
Baratheon
had
looked
old
and
fat
when
he
visited
Winterfell,
yet
he’d
seemed
hale
enough,
and
there’d
been
no
talk
of
illness.
“How
can
you
know?”

“One
of
the
guards
overheard
Clydas
reading
the
letter
to
Maester
Aemon.”
Pyp
leaned
close.
“Jon,
I’m
sorry.
He
was
your
father’s
friend,
wasn’t
he?”

“They
were
as
close
as
brothers,
once.”
Jon
wondered
if
Joffrey
would
keep
his
father
as
the
King’s
Hand.
It
did
not
seem
likely.
That
might
mean
Lord
Eddard
would
return
to
Winterfell,
and
his
sisters
as
well.
He
might
even
be
allowed
to
visit
them,
with
Lord
Mormont’s
permission.
It
would
be
good
to
see
Arya’s
grin
again
and
to
talk
with
his
father.
I
will
ask
him
about
my
mother,
he
resolved.
I
am
a
man
now,
it
is
past
time
he
told
me.
Even
if
she
was
a
whore,
I
don’t
care,
I
want
to
know.

“I
heard
Hake
say
the
dead
men
were
your
uncle’s,”
Pyp
said.

“Yes,”
Jon
replied.
“Two
of
the
six
he
took
with
him.
They’d
been
dead
a
long
time,
only…
the
bodies
are
queer.”

“Queer?”
Pyp
was
all
curiosity.
“How
queer?”

“Sam
will
tell
you.”
Jon
did
not
want
to
talk
of
it.
“I
should
see
if
the
Old
Bear
has
need
of
me.”

He
walked
to
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower
alone,
with
a
curious
sense
of
apprehension.
The
brothers
on
guard
eyed
him
solemnly
as
he
approached.
“The
Old
Bear’s
in
his
solar,”
one
of
them
announced.
“He
was
asking
for
you.”

Jon
nodded.
He
should
have
come
straight
from
the
stable.
He
climbed
the
tower
steps
briskly.
He
wants
wine
or
a
fire
in
his
hearth,
that’s
all,
he
told
himself.

When
he
entered
the
solar,
Mormont’s
raven
screamed
at
him.
“Corn!”
the
bird
shrieked.
“Corn!
Corn!
Corn!”

“Don’t
you
believe
it,
I
just
fed
him,”
the
Old
Bear
growled.
He
was
seated
by
the
window,
reading
a
letter.
“Bring
me
a
cup
of
wine,
and
pour
one
for
yourself.”

“For
myself,
my
lord?”

Mormont
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
letter
to
stare
at
Jon.
There
was
pity
in
that
look;
he
could
taste
it.
“You
heard
me.”

Jon
poured
with
exaggerated
care,
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
drawing
out
the
act.
When
the
cups
were
filled,
he
would
have
no
choice
but
to
face
whatever
was
in
that
letter.
Yet
all
too
soon,
they
were
filled.
“Sit,
boy,”
Mormont
commanded
him.
“Drink.”

Jon
remained
standing.
“It’s
my
father,
isn’t
it?”

The
Old
Bear
tapped
the
letter
with
a
finger.
“Your
father
and
the
king,”
he
rumbled.
“I
won’t
lie
to
you,
it’s
grievous
news.
I
never
thought
to
see
another
king,
not
at
my
age,
with
Robert
half
my
years
and
strong
as
a
bull.”
He
took
a
gulp
of
wine.
“They
say
the
king
loved
to
hunt.
The
things
we
love
destroy
us
every
time,
lad.
Remember
that.
My
son
loved
that
young
wife
of
his.
Vain
woman.
If
not
for
her,
he
would
never
have
thought
to
sell
those
poachers.”

Jon
could
scarcely
follow
what
he
was
saying.
“My
lord,
I
don’t
understand.
What’s
happened
to
my
father?”

“I
told
you
to
sit,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“Sit,”
the
raven
screamed.
“And
have
a
drink,
damn
you.
That’s
a
command,
Snow.”

Jon
sat,
and
took
a
sip
of
wine.

“Lord
Eddard
has
been
imprisoned.
He
is
charged
with
treason.
It
is
said
he
plotted
with
Robert’s
brothers
to
deny
the
throne
to
Prince
Joffrey.”

“No,”
Jon
said
at
once.
“That
couldn’t
be.
My
father
would
never
betray
the
king!”

“Be
that
as
it
may,”
said
Mormont.
“It
is
not
for
me
to
say.
Nor
for
you.”

“But
it’s
a
lie,”
Jon
insisted.
How
could
they
think
his
father
was
a
traitor,
had
they
all
gone
mad?
Lord
Eddard
Stark
would
never
dishonor
himself…
would
he?

He
fathered
a
bastard,
a
small
voice
whispered
inside
him.
Where
was
the
honor
in
that?
And
your
mother,
what
of
her?
He
will
not
even
speak
her
name.

“My
lord,
what
will
happen
to
him?
Will
they
kill
him?”

“As
to
that,
I
cannot
say,
lad.
I
mean
to
send
a
letter.
I
knew
some
of
the
king’s
councillors
in
my
youth.
Old
Pycelle,
Lord
Stannis,
Ser
Barristan…
Whatever
your
father
has
done,
or
hasn’t
done,
he
is
a
great
lord.
He
must
be
allowed
to
take
the
black
and
join
us
here.
Gods
knows,
we
need
men
of
Lord
Eddard’s
ability.”

Jon
knew
that
other
men
accused
of
treason
had
been
allowed
to
redeem
their
honor
on
the
Wall
in
days
past.
Why
not
Lord
Eddard?
His
father
here.
That
was
a
strange
thought,
and
strangely
uncomfortable.
It
would
be
a
monstrous
injustice
to
strip
him
of
Winterfell
and
force
him
to
take
the
black,
and
yet
if
it
meant
his
life…

And
would
Joffrey
allow
it?
He
remembered
the
prince
at
Winterfell,
the
way
he’d
mocked
Robb
and
Ser
Rodrik
in
the
yard.
Jon
himself
he
had
scarcely
even
noticed;
bastards
were
beneath
even
his
contempt.
“My
lord,
will
the
king
listen
to
you?”

The
Old
Bear
shrugged.
“A
boy
king…
I
imagine
he’ll
listen
to
his
mother.
A
pity
the
dwarf
isn’t
with
them.
He’s
the
lad’s
uncle,
and
he
saw
our
need
when
he
visited
us.
It
was
a
bad
thing,
your
lady
mother
taking
him
captive—”

“Lady
Stark
is
not
my
mother,”
Jon
reminded
him
sharply.
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
a
friend
to
him.
If
Lord
Eddard
was
killed,
she
would
be
as
much
to
blame
as
the
queen.
“My
lord,
what
of
my
sisters?
Arya
and
Sansa,
they
were
with
my
father,
do
you
know—”

“Pycelle
makes
no
mention
of
them,
but
doubtless
they’ll
be
treated
gently.
I
will
ask
about
them
when
I
write.”
Mormont
shook
his
head.
“This
could
not
have
happened
at
a
worse
time.
If
ever
the
realm
needed
a
strong
king…
there
are
dark
days
and
cold
nights
ahead,
I
feel
it
in
my
bones…”
He
gave
Jon
a
long
shrewd
look.
“I
hope
you
are
not
thinking
of
doing
anything
stupid,
boy.”

He’s
my
father,
Jon
wanted
to
say,
but
he
knew
that
Mormont
would
not
want
to
hear
it.
His
throat
was
dry.
He
made
himself
take
another
sip
of
wine.

“Your
duty
is
here
now,”
the
Lord
Commander
reminded
him.
“Your
old
life
ended
when
you
took
the
black.”
His
bird
made
a
raucous
echo.
“Black.”
Mormont
took
no
notice.
“Whatever
they
do
in
King’s
Landing
is
none
of
our
concern.”
When
Jon
did
not
answer,
the
old
man
finished
his
wine
and
said,
“You’re
free
to
go.
I’ll
have
no
further
need
of
you
today.
On
the
morrow
you
can
help
me
write
that
letter.”

Jon
did
not
remember
standing
or
leaving
the
solar.
The
next
he
knew,
he
was
descending
the
tower
steps,
thinking,
This
is
my
father,
my
sisters,
how
can
it
be
none
of
my
concern?

Outside,
one
of
the
guards
looked
at
him
and
said,
“Be
strong,
boy.
The
gods
are
cruel.”

They
know,
Jon
realized.
“My
father
is
no
traitor,”
he
said
hoarsely.
Even
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat,
as
if
to
choke
him.
The
wind
was
rising,
and
it
seemed
colder
in
the
yard
than
it
had
when
he’d
gone
in.
Spirit
summer
was
drawing
to
an
end.

The
rest
of
the
afternoon
passed
as
if
in
a
dream.
Jon
could
not
have
said
where
he
walked,
what
he
did,
who
he
spoke
with.
Ghost
was
with
him,
he
knew
that
much.
The
silent
presence
of
the
direwolf
gave
him
comfort.
The
girls
do
not
even
have
that
much,
he
thought.
Their
wolves
might
have
kept
them
safe,
but
Lady
is
dead
and
Nymeria’s
lost,
they’re
all
alone.

A
north
wind
had
begun
to
blow
by
the
time
the
sun
went
down.
Jon
could
hear
it
skirling
against
the
Wall
and
over
the
icy
battlements
as
he
went
to
the
common
hall
for
the
evening
meal.
Hobb
had
cooked
up
a
venison
stew,
thick
with
barley,
onions,
and
carrots.
When
he
spooned
an
extra
portion
onto
Jon’s
plate
and
gave
him
the
crusty
heel
of
the
bread,
he
knew
what
it
meant.
He
knows.
He
looked
around
the
hall,
saw
heads
turn
quickly,
eyes
politely
averted.
They
all
know.

His
friends
rallied
to
him.
“We
asked
the
septon
to
light
a
candle
for
your
father,”
Matthar
told
him.
“It’s
a
lie,
we
all
know
it’s
a
lie,
even
Grenn
knows
it’s
a
lie,”
Pyp
chimed
in.
Grenn
nodded,
and
Sam
clasped
Jon’s
hand,
“You’re
my
brother
now,
so
he’s
my
father
too,”
the
fat
boy
said.
“If
you
want
to
go
out
to
the
weirwoods
and
pray
to
the
old
gods,
I’ll
go
with
you.”

The
weirwoods
were
beyond
the
Wall,
yet
he
knew
Sam
meant
what
he
said.
They
are
my
brothers,
he
thought.
As
much
as
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon…

And
then
he
heard
the
laughter,
sharp
and
cruel
as
a
whip,
and
the
voice
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.
“Not
only
a
bastard,
but
a
traitor’s
bastard,”
he
was
telling
the
men
around
him.

In
the
blink
of
an
eye,
Jon
had
vaulted
onto
the
table,
dagger
in
his
hand.
Pyp
made
a
grab
for
him,
but
he
wrenched
his
leg
away,
and
then
he
was
sprinting
down
the
table
and
kicking
the
bowl
from
Ser
Alliser’s
hand.
Stew
went
flying
everywhere,
spattering
the
brothers.
Thorne
recoiled.
People
were
shouting,
but
Jon
Snow
did
not
hear
them.
He
lunged
at
Ser
Alliser’s
face
with
the
dagger,
slashing
at
those
cold
onyx
eyes,
but
Sam
threw
himself
between
them
and
before
Jon
could
get
around
him,
Pyp
was
on
his
back
clinging
like
a
monkey,
and
Grenn
was
grabbing
his
arm
while
Toad
wrenched
the
knife
from
his
fingers.

Later,
much
later,
after
they
had
marched
him
back
to
his
sleeping
cell,
Mormont
came
down
to
see
him,
raven
on
his
shoulder.
“I
told
you
not
to
do
anything
stupid,
boy,”
the
Old
Bear
said.
“Boy,”
the
bird
chorused.
Mormont
shook
his
head,
disgusted.
“And
to
think
I
had
high
hopes
for
you.”

They
took
his
knife
and
his
sword
and
told
him
he
was
not
to
leave
his
cell
until
the
high
officers
met
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
with
him.
And
then
they
placed
a
guard
outside
his
door
to
make
certain
he
obeyed.
His
friends
were
not
allowed
to
see
him,
but
the
Old
Bear
did
relent
and
permit
him
Ghost,
so
he
was
not
utterly
alone.

“My
father
is
no
traitor,”
he
told
the
direwolf
when
the
rest
had
gone.
Ghost
looked
at
him
in
silence.
Jon
slumped
against
the
wall,
hands
around
his
knees,
and
stared
at
the
candle
on
the
table
beside
his
narrow
bed.
The
flame
flickered
and
swayed,
the
shadows
moved
around
him,
the
room
seemed
to
grow
darker
and
colder.
I
will
not
sleep
tonight,
Jon
thought.

Yet
he
must
have
dozed.
When
he
woke,
his
legs
were
stiff
and
cramped
and
the
candle
had
long
since
burned
out.
Ghost
stood
on
his
hind
legs,
scrabbling
at
the
door.
Jon
was
startled
to
see
how
tall
he’d
grown.
“Ghost,
what
is
it?”
he
called
softly.
The
direwolf
turned
his
head
and
looked
down
at
him,
baring
his
fangs
in
a
silent
snarl.
Has
he
gone
mad?
Jon
wondered.
“It’s
me,
Ghost,”
he
murmured,
trying
not
to
sound
afraid.
Yet
he
was
trembling,
violently.
When
had
it
gotten
so
cold?

Ghost
backed
away
from
the
door.
There
were
deep
gouges
where
he’d
raked
the
wood.
Jon
watched
him
with
mounting
disquiet.
“There’s
someone
out
there,
isn’t
there?”
he
whispered.
Crouching,
the
direwolf
crept
backward,
white
fur
rising
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
The
guard,
he
thought,
they
left
a
man
to
guard
my
door,
Ghost
smells
him
through
the
door,
that’s
all
it
is.

Slowly,
Jon
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
shivering
uncontrollably,
wishing
he
still
had
a
sword.
Three
quick
steps
brought
him
to
the
door.
He
grabbed
the
handle
and
pulled
it
inward.
The
creak
of
the
hinges
almost
made
him
jump.

His
guard
was
sprawled
bonelessly
across
the
narrow
steps,
looking
up
at
him.
Looking
up
at
him,
even
though
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach.
His
head
had
been
twisted
completely
around.

It
can’t
be,
Jon
told
himself.
This
is
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower,
it’s
guarded
day
and
night,
this
couldn’t
happen,
it’s
a
dream,
I’m
having
a
nightmare.

Ghost
slid
past
him,
out
the
door.
The
wolf
started
up
the
steps,
stopped,
looked
back
at
Jon.
That
was
when
he
heard
it;
the
soft
scrape
of
a
boot
on
stone,
the
sound
of
a
latch
turning.
The
sounds
came
from
above.
From
the
Lord
Commander’s
chambers.

A
nightmare
this
might
be,
yet
it
was
no
dream.

The
guard’s
sword
was
in
its
sheath.
Jon
knelt
and
worked
it
free.
The
heft
of
steel
in
his
fist
made
him
bolder.
He
moved
up
the
steps,
Ghost
padding
silently
before
him.
Shadows
lurked
in
every
turn
of
the
stair.
Jon
crept
up
warily,
probing
any
suspicious
darkness
with
the
point
of
his
sword.

Suddenly
he
heard
the
shriek
of
Mormont’s
raven.
“Corn,”
the
bird
was
screaming.
“Corn,
corn,
corn,
corn,
corn,
corn.”
Ghost
bounded
ahead,
and
Jon
came
scrambling
after.
The
door
to
Mormont’s
solar
was
wide
open.
The
direwolf
plunged
through.
Jon
stopped
in
the
doorway,
blade
in
hand,
giving
his
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust.
Heavy
drapes
had
been
pulled
across
the
windows,
and
the
darkness
was
black
as
ink.
“Who’s
there?”
he
called
out.

Then
he
saw
it,
a
shadow
in
the
shadows,
sliding
toward
the
inner
door
that
led
to
Mormont’s
sleeping
cell,
a
man-shape
all
in
black,
cloaked
and
hooded…
but
beneath
the
hood,
its
eyes
shone
with
an
icy
blue
radiance…

Ghost
leapt.
Man
and
wolf
went
down
together
with
neither
scream
nor
snarl,
rolling,
smashing
into
a
chair,
knocking
over
a
table
laden
with
papers.
Mormont’s
raven
was
flapping
overhead,
screaming,
“Corn,
corn,
corn,
corn.”
Jon
felt
as
blind
as
Maester
Aemon.
Keeping
the
wall
to
his
back,
he
slid
toward
the
window
and
ripped
down
the
curtain.
Moonlight
flooded
the
solar.
He
glimpsed
black
hands
buried
in
white
fur,
swollen
dark
fingers
tightening
around
his
direwolf’s
throat.
Ghost
was
twisting
and
snapping,
legs
flailing
in
the
air,
but
he
could
not
break
free.

Jon
had
no
time
to
be
afraid.
He
threw
himself
forward,
shouting,
bringing
down
the
longsword
with
all
his
weight
behind
it.
Steel
sheared
through
sleeve
and
skin
and
bone,
yet
the
sound
was
wrong
somehow.
The
smell
that
engulfed
him
was
so
queer
and
cold
he
almost
gagged.
He
saw
arm
and
hand
on
the
floor,
black
fingers
wriggling
in
a
pool
of
moonlight.
Ghost
wrenched
free
of
the
other
hand
and
crept
away,
red
tongue
lolling
from
his
mouth.

The
hooded
man
lifted
his
pale
moon
face,
and
Jon
slashed
at
it
without
hesitation.
The
sword
laid
the
intruder
open
to
the
bone,
taking
off
half
his
nose
and
opening
a
gash
cheek
to
cheek
under
those
eyes,
eyes,
eyes
like
blue
stars
burning.
Jon
knew
that
face.
Othor,
he
thought,
reeling
back.
Gods,
he’s
dead,
he’s
dead,
I
saw
him
dead.

He
felt
something
scrabble
at
his
ankle.
Black
fingers
clawed
at
his
calf.
The
arm
was
crawling
up
his
leg,
ripping
at
wool
and
flesh.
Shouting
with
revulsion,
Jon
pried
the
fingers
off
his
leg
with
the
point
of
his
sword
and
flipped
the
thing
away.
It
lay
writhing,
fingers
opening
and
closing.

The
corpse
lurched
forward.
There
was
no
blood.
One-armed,
face
cut
near
in
half,
it
seemed
to
feel
nothing.
Jon
held
the
longsword
before
him.
“Stay
away!”
he
commanded,
his
voice
gone
shrill.
“Corn,”
screamed
the
raven,
“corn,
corn.”
The
severed
arm
was
wriggling
out
of
its
torn
sleeve,
a
pale
snake
with
a
black
five-fingered
head.
Ghost
pounced
and
got
it
between
his
teeth.
Finger
bones
crunched.
Jon
hacked
at
the
corpse’s
neck,
felt
the
steel
bite
deep
and
hard.

Dead
Othor
slammed
into
him,
knocking
him
off
his
feet.

Jon’s
breath
went
out
of
him
as
the
fallen
table
caught
him
between
his
shoulder
blades.
The
sword,
where
was
the
sword?
He’d
lost
the
damned
sword!
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
the
wight
jammed
its
black
corpse
fingers
into
Jon’s
mouth.
Gagging,
he
tried
to
shove
it
off,
but
the
dead
man
was
too
heavy.
Its
hand
forced
itself
farther
down
his
throat,
icy
cold,
choking
him.
Its
face
was
against
his
own,
filling
the
world.
Frost
covered
its
eyes,
sparkling
blue.
Jon
raked
cold
flesh
with
his
nails
and
kicked
at
the
thing’s
legs.
He
tried
to
bite,
tried
to
punch,
tried
to
breathe…

And
suddenly
the
corpse’s
weight
was
gone,
its
fingers
ripped
from
his
throat.
It
was
all
Jon
could
do
to
roll
over,
retching
and
shaking.

Ghost
had
it
again.
He
watched
as
the
direwolf
buried
his
teeth
in
the
wight’s
gut
and
began
to
rip
and
tear.
He
watched,
only
half
conscious,
for
a
long
moment
before
he
finally
remembered
to
look
for
his
sword…

…
and
saw
Lord
Mormont,
naked
and
groggy
from
sleep,
standing
in
the
doorway
with
an
oil
lamp
in
hand.
Gnawed
and
fingerless,
the
arm
thrashed
on
the
floor,
wriggling
toward
him.

Jon
tried
to
shout,
but
his
voice
was
gone.
Staggering
to
his
feet,
he
kicked
the
arm
away
and
snatched
the
lamp
from
the
Old
Bear’s
fingers.
The
flame
flickered
and
almost
died.
“Burn!”
the
raven
cawed.
“Burn,
burn,
burn!”

Spinning,
Jon
saw
the
drapes
he’d
ripped
from
the
window.
He
flung
the
lamp
into
the
puddled
cloth
with
both
hands.
Metal
crunched,
glass
shattered,
oil
spewed,
and
the
hangings
went
up
in
a
great
whoosh
of
flame.
The
heat
of
it
on
his
face
was
sweeter
than
any
kiss
Jon
had
ever
known.
“Ghost!”
he
shouted.

The
direwolf
wrenched
free
and
came
to
him
as
the
wight
struggled
to
rise,
dark
snakes
spilling
from
the
great
wound
in
its
belly.
Jon
plunged
his
hand
into
the
flames,
grabbed
a
fistful
of
the
burning
drapes,
and
whipped
them
at
the
dead
man.
Let
it
burn,
he
prayed
as
the
cloth
smothered
the
corpse,
gods,
please,
please,
let
it
burn.





BRAN

The
Karstarks
came
in
on
a
cold
windy
morning,
bringing
three
hundred
horsemen
and
near
two
thousand
foot
from
their
castle
at
Karhold.
The
steel
points
of
their
pikes
winked
in
the
pale
sunlight
as
the
column
approached.
A
man
went
before
them,
pounding
out
a
slow,
deep-throated
marching
rhythm
on
a
drum
that
was
bigger
than
he
was,
boom,
boom,
boom.

Bran
watched
them
come
from
a
guard
turret
atop
the
outer
wall,
peering
through
Maester
Luwin’s
bronze
far-eye
while
perched
on
Hodor’s
shoulders.
Lord
Rickard
himself
led
them,
his
sons
Harrion
and
Eddard
and
Torrhen
riding
beside
him
beneath
night-black
banners
emblazoned
with
the
white
sunburst
of
their
House.
Old
Nan
said
they
had
Stark
blood
in
them,
going
back
hundreds
of
years,
but
they
did
not
look
like
Starks
to
Bran.
They
were
big
men,
and
fierce,
faces
covered
with
thick
beards,
hair
worn
loose
past
the
shoulders.
Their
cloaks
were
made
of
skins,
the
pelts
of
bear
and
seal
and
wolf.

They
were
the
last,
he
knew.
The
other
lords
were
already
here,
with
their
hosts.
Bran
yearned
to
ride
out
among
them,
to
see
the
winter
houses
full
to
bursting,
the
jostling
crowds
in
the
market
square
every
morning,
the
streets
rutted
and
torn
by
wheel
and
hoof.
But
Robb
had
forbidden
him
to
leave
the
castle.
“We
have
no
men
to
spare
to
guard
you,”
his
brother
had
explained.

“I’ll
take
Summer,”
Bran
argued.

“Don’t
act
the
boy
with
me,
Bran,”
Robb
said.
“You
know
better
than
that.
Only
two
days
ago
one
of
Lord
Bolton’s
men
knifed
one
of
Lord
Cerwyn’s
at
the
Smoking
Log.
Our
lady
mother
would
skin
me
for
a
pelt
if
I
let
you
put
yourself
at
risk.”
He
was
using
the
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord
when
he
said
it;
Bran
knew
that
meant
there
was
no
appeal.

It
was
because
of
what
had
happened
in
the
wolfswood,
he
knew.
The
memory
still
gave
him
bad
dreams.
He
had
been
as
helpless
as
a
baby,
no
more
able
to
defend
himself
than
Rickon
would
have
been.
Less,
even…
Rickon
would
have
kicked
them,
at
the
least.
It
shamed
him.
He
was
only
a
few
years
younger
than
Robb;
if
his
brother
was
almost
a
man
grown,
so
was
he.
He
should
have
been
able
to
protect
himself.

A
year
ago,
before,
he
would
have
visited
the
town
even
if
it
meant
climbing
over
the
walls
by
himself.
In
those
days
he
could
run
down
stairs,
get
on
and
off
his
pony
by
himself,
and
wield
a
wooden
sword
good
enough
to
knock
Prince
Tommen
in
the
dirt.
Now
he
could
only
watch,
peering
out
through
Maester
Luwin’s
lens
tube.
The
maester
had
taught
him
all
the
banners:
the
mailed
fist
of
the
Glovers,
silver
on
scarlet;
Lady
Mormont’s
black
bear;
the
hideous
flayed
man
that
went
before
Roose
Bolton
of
the
Dreadfort;
a
bull
moose
for
the
Hornwoods;
a
battle-axe
for
the
Cerwyns;
three
sentinel
trees
for
the
Tallharts;
and
the
fearsome
sigil
of
House
Umber,
a
roaring
giant
in
shattered
chains.

And
soon
enough
he
learned
the
faces
too,
when
the
lords
and
their
sons
and
knights
retainer
came
to
Winterfell
to
feast.
Even
the
Great
Hall
was
not
large
enough
to
seat
all
of
them
at
once,
so
Robb
hosted
each
of
the
principal
bannermen
in
turn.
Bran
was
always
given
the
place
of
honor
at
his
brother’s
right
hand.
Some
of
the
lords
bannermen
gave
him
queer
hard
stares
as
he
sat
there,
as
if
they
wondered
by
what
right
a
green
boy
should
be
placed
above
them,
and
him
a
cripple
too.

“How
many
is
it
now?”
Bran
asked
Maester
Luwin
as
Lord
Karstark
and
his
sons
rode
through
the
gates
in
the
outer
wall.

“Twelve
thousand
men,
or
near
enough
as
makes
no
matter.”

“How
many
knights?”

“Few
enough,”
the
maester
said
with
a
touch
of
impatience.
“To
be
a
knight,
you
must
stand
your
vigil
in
a
sept,
and
be
anointed
with
the
seven
oils
to
consecrate
your
vows.
In
the
north,
only
a
few
of
the
great
houses
worship
the
Seven.
The
rest
honor
the
old
gods,
and
name
no
knights…
but
those
lords
and
their
sons
and
sworn
swords
are
no
less
fierce
or
loyal
or
honorable.
A
man’s
worth
is
not
marked
by
a
ser
before
his
name.
As
I
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
before.”

“Still,”
said
Bran,
“how
many
knights?”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“Three
hundred,
perhaps
four…
among
three
thousand
armored
lances
who
are
not
knights.”

“Lord
Karstark
is
the
last,”
Bran
said
thoughtfully.
“Robb
will
feast
him
tonight.”

“No
doubt
he
will.”

“How
long
before…
before
they
go?”

“He
must
march
soon,
or
not
at
all,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“The
winter
town
is
full
to
bursting,
and
this
army
of
his
will
eat
the
countryside
clean
if
it
camps
here
much
longer.
Others
are
waiting
to
join
him
all
along
the
kingsroad,
barrow
knights
and
crannogmen
and
the
Lords
Manderly
and
Flint.
The
fighting
has
begun
in
the
riverlands,
and
your
brother
has
many
leagues
to
go.”

“I
know.”
Bran
felt
as
miserable
as
he
sounded.
He
handed
the
bronze
tube
back
to
the
maester,
and
noticed
how
thin
Luwin’s
hair
had
grown
on
top.
He
could
see
the
pink
of
scalp
showing
through.
It
felt
queer
to
look
down
on
him
this
way,
when
he’d
spent
his
whole
life
looking
up
at
him,
but
when
you
sat
on
Hodor’s
back
you
looked
down
on
everyone.
“I
don’t
want
to
watch
anymore.
Hodor,
take
me
back
to
the
keep.”

“Hodor,”
said
Hodor.

Maester
Luwin
tucked
the
tube
up
his
sleeve.
“Bran,
your
lord
brother
will
not
have
time
to
see
you
now.
He
must
greet
Lord
Karstark
and
his
sons
and
make
them
welcome.”

“I
won’t
trouble
Robb.
I
want
to
visit
the
godswood.”
He
put
his
hand
on
Hodor’s
shoulder.
“Hodor.”

A
series
of
chisel-cut
handholds
made
a
ladder
in
the
granite
of
the
tower’s
inner
wall.
Hodor
hummed
tunelessly
as
he
went
down
hand
under
hand,
Bran
bouncing
against
his
back
in
the
wicker
seat
that
Maester
Luwin
had
fashioned
for
him.
Luwin
had
gotten
the
idea
from
the
baskets
the
women
used
to
carry
firewood
on
their
backs;
after
that
it
had
been
a
simple
matter
of
cutting
legholes
and
attaching
some
new
straps
to
spread
Bran’s
weight
more
evenly.
It
was
not
as
good
as
riding
Dancer,
but
there
were
places
Dancer
could
not
go,
and
this
did
not
shame
Bran
the
way
it
did
when
Hodor
carried
him
in
his
arms
like
a
baby.
Hodor
seemed
to
like
it
too,
though
with
Hodor
it
was
hard
to
tell.
The
only
tricky
part
was
doors.
Sometimes
Hodor
forgot
that
he
had
Bran
on
his
back,
and
that
could
be
painful
when
he
went
through
a
door.

For
near
a
fortnight
there
had
been
so
many
comings
and
goings
that
Robb
ordered
both
portcullises
kept
up
and
the
drawbridge
down
between
them,
even
in
the
dead
of
night.
A
long
column
of
armored
lancers
was
crossing
the
moat
between
the
walls
when
Bran
emerged
from
the
tower;
Karstark
men,
following
their
lords
into
the
castle.
They
wore
black
iron
halfhelms
and
black
woolen
cloaks
patterned
with
the
white
sunburst.
Hodor
trotted
along
beside
them,
smiling
to
himself,
his
boots
thudding
against
the
wood
of
the
drawbridge.
The
riders
gave
them
queer
looks
as
they
went
by,
and
once
Bran
heard
someone
guffaw.
He
refused
to
let
it
trouble
him.
“Men
will
look
at
you,”
Maester
Luwin
had
warned
him
the
first
time
they
had
strapped
the
wicker
basket
around
Hodor’s
chest.
“They
will
look,
and
they
will
talk,
and
some
will
mock
you.”
Let
them
mock,
Bran
thought.
No
one
mocked
him
in
his
bedchamber,
but
he
would
not
live
his
life
in
bed.

As
they
passed
beneath
the
gatehouse
portcullis,
Bran
put
two
fingers
into
his
mouth
and
whistled.
Summer
came
loping
across
the
yard.
Suddenly
the
Karstark
lancers
were
fighting
for
control,
as
their
horses
rolled
their
eyes
and
whickered
in
dismay.
One
stallion
reared,
screaming,
his
rider
cursing
and
hanging
on
desperately.
The
scent
of
the
direwolves
sent
horses
into
a
frenzy
of
fear
if
they
were
not
accustomed
to
it,
but
they’d
quiet
soon
enough
once
Summer
was
gone.
“The
godswood,”
Bran
reminded
Hodor.

Even
Winterfell
itself
was
crowded.
The
yard
rang
to
the
sound
of
sword
and
axe,
the
rumble
of
wagons,
and
the
barking
of
dogs.
The
armory
doors
were
open,
and
Bran
glimpsed
Mikken
at
his
forge,
his
hammer
ringing
as
sweat
dripped
off
his
bare
chest.
Bran
had
never
seen
as
many
strangers
in
all
his
years,
not
even
when
King
Robert
had
come
to
visit
Father.

He
tried
not
to
flinch
as
Hodor
ducked
through
a
low
door.
They
walked
down
a
long
dim
hallway,
Summer
padding
easily
beside
them.
The
wolf
glanced
up
from
time
to
time,
eyes
smoldering
like
liquid
gold.
Bran
would
have
liked
to
touch
him,
but
he
was
riding
too
high
for
his
hand
to
reach.

The
godswood
was
an
island
of
peace
in
the
sea
of
chaos
that
Winterfell
had
become.
Hodor
made
his
way
through
the
dense
stands
of
oak
and
ironwood
and
sentinels,
to
the
still
pool
beside
the
heart
tree.
He
stopped
under
the
gnarled
limbs
of
the
weirwood,
humming.
Bran
reached
up
over
his
head
and
pulled
himself
out
of
his
seat,
drawing
the
dead
weight
of
his
legs
up
through
the
holes
in
the
wicker
basket.
He
hung
for
a
moment,
dangling,
the
dark
red
leaves
brushing
against
his
face,
until
Hodor
lifted
him
and
lowered
him
to
the
smooth
stone
beside
the
water.
“I
want
to
be
by
myself
for
a
while,”
he
said.
“You
go
soak.
Go
to
the
pools.”

“Hodor.”
Hodor
stomped
through
the
trees
and
vanished.
Across
the
godswood,
beneath
the
windows
of
the
Guest
House,
an
underground
hot
spring
fed
three
small
ponds.
Steam
rose
from
the
water
day
and
night,
and
the
wall
that
loomed
above
was
thick
with
moss.
Hodor
hated
cold
water,
and
would
fight
like
a
treed
wildcat
when
threatened
with
soap,
but
he
would
happily
immerse
himself
in
the
hottest
pool
and
sit
for
hours,
giving
a
loud
burp
to
echo
the
spring
whenever
a
bubble
rose
from
the
murky
green
depths
to
break
upon
the
surface.

Summer
lapped
at
the
water
and
settled
down
at
Bran’s
side.
He
rubbed
the
wolf
under
the
jaw,
and
for
a
moment
boy
and
beast
both
felt
at
peace.
Bran
had
always
liked
the
godswood,
even
before,
but
of
late
he
found
himself
drawn
to
it
more
and
more.
Even
the
heart
tree
no
longer
scared
him
the
way
it
used
to.
The
deep
red
eyes
carved
into
the
pale
trunk
still
watched
him,
yet
somehow
he
took
comfort
from
that
now.
The
gods
were
looking
over
him,
he
told
himself;
the
old
gods,
gods
of
the
Starks
and
the
First
Men
and
the
children
of
the
forest,
his
father’s
gods.
He
felt
safe
in
their
sight,
and
the
deep
silence
of
the
trees
helped
him
think.
Bran
had
been
thinking
a
lot
since
his
fall;
thinking,
and
dreaming,
and
talking
with
the
gods.

“Please
make
it
so
Robb
won’t
go
away,”
he
prayed
softly.
He
moved
his
hand
through
the
cold
water,
sending
ripples
across
the
pool.
“Please
make
him
stay.
Or
if
he
has
to
go,
bring
him
home
safe,
with
Mother
and
Father
and
the
girls.
And
make
it…
make
it
so
Rickon
understands.”

His
baby
brother
had
been
wild
as
a
winter
storm
since
he
learned
Robb
was
riding
off
to
war,
weeping
and
angry
by
turns.
He’d
refused
to
eat,
cried
and
screamed
for
most
of
a
night,
even
punched
Old
Nan
when
she
tried
to
sing
him
to
sleep,
and
the
next
day
he’d
vanished.
Robb
had
set
half
the
castle
searching
for
him,
and
when
at
last
they’d
found
him
down
in
the
crypts,
Rickon
had
slashed
at
them
with
a
rusted
iron
sword
he’d
snatched
from
a
dead
king’s
hand,
and
Shaggydog
had
come
slavering
out
of
the
darkness
like
a
green-eyed
demon.
The
wolf
was
near
as
wild
as
Rickon;
he’d
bitten
Gage
on
the
arm
and
torn
a
chunk
of
flesh
from
Mikken’s
thigh.
It
had
taken
Robb
himself
and
Grey
Wind
to
bring
him
to
bay.
Farlen
had
the
black
wolf
chained
up
in
the
kennels
now,
and
Rickon
cried
all
the
more
for
being
without
him.

Maester
Luwin
counseled
Robb
to
remain
at
Winterfell,
and
Bran
pleaded
with
him
too,
for
his
own
sake
as
much
as
Rickon’s,
but
his
brother
only
shook
his
head
stubbornly
and
said,
“I
don’t
want
to
go.
I
have
to.”

It
was
only
half
a
lie.
Someone
had
to
go,
to
hold
the
Neck
and
help
the
Tullys
against
the
Lannisters,
Bran
could
understand
that,
but
it
did
not
have
to
be
Robb.
His
brother
might
have
given
the
command
to
Hal
Mollen
or
Theon
Greyjoy,
or
to
one
of
his
lords
bannermen.
Maester
Luwin
urged
him
to
do
just
that,
but
Robb
would
not
hear
of
it.
“My
lord
father
would
never
have
sent
men
off
to
die
while
he
huddled
like
a
craven
behind
the
walls
of
Winterfell,”
he
said,
all
Robb
the
Lord.

Robb
seemed
half
a
stranger
to
Bran
now,
transformed,
a
lord
in
truth,
though
he
had
not
yet
seen
his
sixteenth
name
day.
Even
their
father’s
bannermen
seemed
to
sense
it.
Many
tried
to
test
him,
each
in
his
own
way.
Roose
Bolton
and
Robett
Glover
both
demanded
the
honor
of
battle
command,
the
first
brusquely,
the
second
with
a
smile
and
a
jest.
Stout,
grey-haired
Maege
Mormont,
dressed
in
mail
like
a
man,
told
Robb
bluntly
that
he
was
young
enough
to
be
her
grandson,
and
had
no
business
giving
her
commands…
but
as
it
happened,
she
had
a
granddaughter
she
would
be
willing
to
have
him
marry.
Soft-spoken
Lord
Cerwyn
had
actually
brought
his
daughter
with
him,
a
plump,
homely
maid
of
thirty
years
who
sat
at
her
father’s
left
hand
and
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
plate.
Jovial
Lord
Hornwood
had
no
daughters,
but
he
did
bring
gifts,
a
horse
one
day,
a
haunch
of
venison
the
next,
a
silver-chased
hunting
horn
the
day
after,
and
he
asked
nothing
in
return…
nothing
but
a
certain
holdfast
taken
from
his
grandfather,
and
hunting
rights
north
of
a
certain
ridge,
and
leave
to
dam
the
White
Knife,
if
it
please
the
lord.

Robb
answered
each
of
them
with
cool
courtesy,
much
as
Father
might
have,
and
somehow
he
bent
them
to
his
will.

And
when
Lord
Umber,
who
was
called
the
Greatjon
by
his
men
and
stood
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
twice
as
wide,
threatened
to
take
his
forces
home
if
he
was
placed
behind
the
Hornwoods
or
the
Cerwyns
in
the
order
of
march,
Robb
told
him
he
was
welcome
to
do
so.
“And
when
we
are
done
with
the
Lannisters,”
he
promised,
scratching
Grey
Wind
behind
the
ear,
“we
will
march
back
north,
root
you
out
of
your
keep,
and
hang
you
for
an
oathbreaker.”
Cursing,
the
Greatjon
flung
a
flagon
of
ale
into
the
fire
and
bellowed
that
Robb
was
so
green
he
must
piss
grass.
When
Hallis
Mollen
moved
to
restrain
him,
he
knocked
him
to
the
floor,
kicked
over
a
table,
and
unsheathed
the
biggest,
ugliest
greatsword
that
Bran
had
ever
seen.
All
along
the
benches,
his
sons
and
brothers
and
sworn
swords
leapt
to
their
feet,
grabbing
for
their
steel.

Yet
Robb
only
said
a
quiet
word,
and
in
a
snarl
and
the
blink
of
an
eye
Lord
Umber
was
on
his
back,
his
sword
spinning
on
the
floor
three
feet
away
and
his
hand
dripping
blood
where
Grey
Wind
had
bitten
off
two
fingers.
“My
lord
father
taught
me
that
it
was
death
to
bare
steel
against
your
liege
lord,”
Robb
said,
“but
doubtless
you
only
meant
to
cut
my
meat.”
Bran’s
bowels
went
to
water
as
the
Greatjon
struggled
to
rise,
sucking
at
the
red
stumps
of
fingers…
but
then,
astonishingly,
the
huge
man
laughed.
“Your
meat,”
he
roared,
“is
bloody
tough.”

And
somehow
after
that
the
Greatjon
became
Robb’s
right
hand,
his
staunchest
champion,
loudly
telling
all
and
sundry
that
the
boy
lord
was
a
Stark
after
all,
and
they’d
damn
well
better
bend
their
knees
if
they
didn’t
fancy
having
them
chewed
off.

Yet
that
very
night,
his
brother
came
to
Bran’s
bedchamber
pale
and
shaken,
after
the
fires
had
burned
low
in
the
Great
Hall.
“I
thought
he
was
going
to
kill
me,”
Robb
confessed.
“Did
you
see
the
way
he
threw
down
Hal,
like
he
was
no
bigger
than
Rickon?
Gods,
I
was
so
scared.
And
the
Greatjon’s
not
the
worst
of
them,
only
the
loudest.
Lord
Roose
never
says
a
word,
he
only
looks
at
me,
and
all
I
can
think
of
is
that
room
they
have
in
the
Dreadfort,
where
the
Boltons
hang
the
skins
of
their
enemies.”

“That’s
just
one
of
Old
Nan’s
stories,”
Bran
said.
A
note
of
doubt
crept
into
his
voice.
“Isn’t
it?”

“I
don’t
know.”
He
gave
a
weary
shake
of
his
head.
“Lord
Cerwyn
means
to
take
his
daughter
south
with
us.
To
cook
for
him,
he
says.
Theon
is
certain
I’ll
find
the
girl
in
my
bedroll
one
night.
I
wish…
I
wish
Father
was
here…”

That
was
the
one
thing
they
could
agree
on,
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb
the
Lord;
they
all
wished
Father
was
here.
But
Lord
Eddard
>>>>>>> asd
was
a
thousand
leagues
away,
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
in
the
clutches
of
the
Lannisters.
A
shame.

The
wood
grew
ever
wilder.
The
pines
and
sentinels
gave
way
to
huge
dark
oaks.
Tangles
of
hawthorn
concealed
treacherous
gullies
and
cuts.
Stony
hills
rose
and
fell.
They
passed
a
crofter’s
cottage,
deserted
and
overgown,
and
skirted
a
flooded
quarry
where
the
still
water
had
a
sheen
as
grey
as
steel.
When
the
dogs
began
to
bay,
Theon
figured
the
fugitives
were
near
at
hand.
He
spurred
Smiler
and
followed
at
a
trot,
but
what
he
found
was
only
the
carcass
of
a
young
elk…
or
what
remained
of
it.

He
dismounted
for
a
closer
look.
The
kill
was
still
fresh,
and
plainly
the
work
of
wolves.
The
dogs
sniffed
round
it
eagerly,
and
one
of
the
mastiffs
buried
his
teeth
in
a
haunch
until
Farlen
shouted
him
off.
No
part
of
this
animal
has
been
butchered,
Theon
realized.
The
wolves
ate,
but
not
the
men.
Even
if
Osha
did
not
want
to
risk
a
fire,
she
ought
to
have
cut
them
a
few
steaks.
It
made
no
sense
to
leave
so
much
good
meat
to
rot.
“Farlen,
are
you
certain
we’re
on
the
right
trail?”
he
demanded.
“Could
your
dogs
be
chasing
the
wrong
wolves?”

“My
bitch
knows
the
smell
of
Summer
and
Shaggy
well
enough.”

“I
hope
so.
For
your
sake.”

Less
than
an
hour
later,
the
trail
led
down
a
slope
toward
a
muddy
brook
swollen
by
the
recent
rains.
It
was
there
the
dogs
lost
the
scent.
Farlen
and
Wex
waded
across
with
the
hounds
and
came
back
shaking
their
heads
while
the
animals
ranged
up
and
down
the
far
bank,
sniffing.
“They
went
in
here,
m’lord,
but
I
can’t
see
where
they
come
out,”
the
kennelmaster
said.

Theon
dismounted
and
knelt
beside
the
stream.
He
dipped
a
hand
in
it.
The
water
was
cold.
“They
won’t
have
stayed
long
in
this,”
he
said.
“Take
half
the
dogs
downstream,
I’ll
go
up—”

Wex
clapped
his
hands
together
loudly.

“What
is
it?”
Theon
said.

The
mute
boy
pointed.

The
ground
near
the
water
was
sodden
and
muddy.
The
tracks
the
wolves
had
left
were
plain
enough.
“Pawprints,
yes.
So?”

Wex
drove
his
heel
into
the
mud,
and
pivoted
his
foot
this
way
and
that.
It
left
a
deep
gouge.

Joseth
understood.
“A
man
the
size
of
Hodor
ought
to
have
left
a
deep
print
in
this
mud,”
he
said.
“More
so
with
the
weight
of
a
boy
on
his
back.
Yet
the
only
boot
prints
here
are
our
own.
See
for
yourself.”

Appalled,
Theon
saw
it
was
true.
The
wolves
had
gone
into
the
turgid
brown
water
alone.
“Osha
must
have
turned
aside
back
of
us.
Before
the
elk,
most
likely.
She
sent
the
wolves
on
by
themselves,
hoping
we’d
chase
after
them.”
He
rounded
on
his
huntsmen.
“If
you
two
have
played
me
false—”

“There’s
been
only
the
one
trail,
my
lord,
I
swear
it,”
said
Gariss
defensively.
“And
the
direwolves
would
never
have
parted
from
them
boys.
Not
for
long.”

That’s
so,
Theon
thought.
Summer
and
Shaggydog
might
have
gone
off
to
hunt,
but
soon
or
late
they
would
return
to
Bran
and
Rickon.
“Gariss,
Murch,
take
four
dogs
and
double
back,
find
where
we
lost
them.
Aggar,
you
watch
them,
I’ll
have
no
trickery.
Farlen
and
I
will
follow
the
direwolves.
Give
a
blast
on
the
horn
when
you
pick
up
the
trail.
Two
blasts
if
you
catch
sight
of
the
beasts
themselves.
Once
we
find
where
they
went,
they’ll
lead
us
back
to
their
masters.”

He
took
Wex,
the
Frey
boy,
and
Gynir
Rednose
to
search
upstream.
He
and
Wex
rode
on
one
side
of
the
brook,
Rednose
and
Walder
Frey
on
the
other,
each
with
a
pair
of
hounds.
The
wolves
might
have
come
out
on
either
bank.
Theon
kept
an
eye
out
for
tracks,
spoor,
broken
branches,
any
hint
as
to
where
the
direwolves
might
have
left
the
water.
He
spied
the
prints
of
deer,
elk,
and
badger
easily
enough.
Wex
surprised
a
vixen
drinking
at
the
stream,
and
Walder
flushed
three
rabbits
from
the
underbrush
and
managed
to
put
an
arrow
in
one.
They
saw
the
claw
marks
where
a
bear
had
shredded
the
bark
of
a
tall
birch.
But
of
the
direwolves
there
was
no
sign.

A
little
farther,
Theon
told
himself.
Past
that
oak,
over
that
rise,
past
the
next
bend
of
the
stream,
we’ll
find
something
there.
He
pressed
on
long
after
he
knew
he
should
turn
back,
a
growing
sense
of
anxiety
gnawing
at
his
belly.
It
was
midday
when
he
wrenched
Smiler’s
head
round
in
disgust
and
gave
up.

Somehow
Osha
and
the
wretched
boys
were
eluding
him.
It
should
not
have
been
possible,
not
on
foot,
burdened
with
a
cripple
and
a
young
child.
Every
passing
hour
increased
the
likelihood
that
they
would
make
good
their
escape.
If
they
reach
a
village…
The
people
of
the
north
would
never
deny
Ned
Stark’s
sons,
Robb’s
brothers.
They’d
have
mounts
to
speed
them
on
their
way,
food.
Men
would
fight
for
the
honor
of
protecting
them.
The
whole
bloody
north
would
rally
around
them.

The
wolves
went
downstream,
that’s
all.
He
clung
to
that
thought.
That
red
bitch
will
sniff
where
they
came
out
of
the
water
and
we’ll
be
after
them
again.

But
when
they
joined
up
with
Farlen’s
party,
one
look
at
the
kennelmaster’s
face
smashed
all
of
Theon’s
hopes
to
shards.
“The
only
thing
those
dogs
are
fit
for
is
a
bear
baiting,”
he
said
angrily.
“Would
that
I
had
a
bear.”

“The
dogs
are
not
at
fault.”
Farlen
knelt
between
a
mastiff
and
his
precious
red
bitch,
a
hand
on
each.
“Running
water
don’t
hold
no
scents,
m’lord.”

“The
wolves
had
to
come
out
of
the
stream
somewhere.”

“No
doubt
they
did.
Upstream
or
down.
We
keep
on,
we’ll
find
the
place,
but
which
way?”

“I
never
knew
a
wolf
to
run
up
a
streambed
for
miles,”
said
Reek.
“A
man
might.
If
he
knew
he
was
being
hunted,
he
might.
But
a
wolf?”

Yet
Theon
wondered.
These
beasts
were
not
as
other
wolves.
I
should
have
skinned
the
cursed
things.

It
was
the
same
tale
all
over
again
when
they
rejoined
Gariss,
Murch,
and
Aggar.
The
huntsmen
had
retraced
their
steps
halfway
to
Winterfell
without
finding
any
sign
of
where
the
Starks
might
have
parted
company
with
the
direwolves.
Farlen’s
hounds
seemed
as
frustrated
as
their
masters,
sniffing
forlornly
at
trees
and
rocks
and
snapping
irritably
at
each
other.

Theon
dared
not
admit
defeat.
“We’ll
return
to
the
brook.
Search
again.
This
time
we’ll
go
as
far
as
we
must.”

“We
won’t
find
them,”
the
Frey
boy
said
suddenly.
“Not
so
long
as
the
frogeaters
are
with
them.
Mudmen
are
sneaks,
they
won’t
fight
like
decent
folks,
they
skulk
and
use
poison
arrows,
You
never
see
them,
but
they
see
you.
Those
who
go
into
the
bogs
after
them
get
lost
and
never
come
out.
Their
houses
move,
even
the
castles
like
Greywater
Watch.”
He
glanced
nervously
at
greenery
that
encircled
them
on
all
sides.
“They
might
be
out
there
right
now,
listening
to
everything
we
say.”

Farlen
laughed
to
show
what
he
thought
of
that
notion.
“My
dogs
would
smell
anything
in
them
bushes.
Be
all
over
them
before
you
could
break
wind,
boy.”

“Frogeaters
don’t
smell
like
men,”
Frey
insisted.
“They
have
a
boggy
stink,
like
frogs
and
trees
and
scummy
water.
Moss
grows
under
their
arms
in
place
of
hair,
and
they
can
live
with
nothing
to
eat
but
mud
and
breathe
swamp
water.”

Theon
was
about
to
tell
him
what
he
ought
to
do
with
his
wet
nurse’s
fable
when
Maester
Luwin
spoke
up.
“The
histories
say
the
crannogmen
grew
close
to
the
children
of
the
forest
in
the
days
when
the
greenseers
tried
to
bring
the
hammer
of
the
waters
down
upon
the
Neck.
It
may
be
that
they
have
secret
knowledge.”

Suddenly
the
wood
seemed
a
deal
darker
than
it
had
a
moment
before,
as
if
a
cloud
had
passed
before
the
sun.
It
was
one
thing
to
have
some
fool
boy
spouting
folly,
but
maesters
were
supposed
to
be
wise.
“The
only
children
that
concern
me
are
Bran
and
Rickon,”
Theon
said.
“Back
to
the
stream.
Now.”

For
a
moment
he
did
not
think
they
were
going
to
obey,
but
in
the
end
old
habit
asserted
itself.
They
followed
sullenly,
but
they
followed.
The
Frey
boy
was
as
jumpy
as
those
rabbits
he’d
flushed
earlier.
Theon
put
men
on
either
bank
and
followed
the
current.
They
rode
for
miles,
going
slow
and
careful,
dismounting
to
lead
the
horses
over
treacherous
ground,
letting
the
good-for-bear-bait
hounds
sniff
at
every
bush.
Where
a
fallen
tree
dammed
the
flow,
the
hunters
were
forced
to
loop
around
a
deep
green
pool,
but
if
the
direwolves
had
done
the
same
they’d
left
neither
print
nor
spoor.
The
beasts
had
taken
to
swimming,
it
seemed.
When
I
catch
them,
they’ll
have
all
the
swimming
they
can
stomach.
I’ll
give
them
both
to
the
Drowned
God.

When
the
woods
began
to
darken,
Theon
Greyjoy
knew
he
was
beaten.
Either
the
crannogmen
did
know
the
magic
of
the
children
of
the
forest,
or
else
Osha
had
deceived
them
with
some
wildling
trick.
He
made
them
press
on
through
the
dusk,
but
when
the
last
light
faded
Joseth
finally
worked
up
the
courage
to
say,
“This
is
fruitless,
my
lord.
We
will
lame
a
horse,
break
a
leg.”

“Joseth
has
the
right
of
it,”
said
Maester
Luwin.
“Groping
through
the
woods
by
torchlight
will
avail
us
nothing.”

Theon
could
taste
bile
at
the
back
of
his
throat,
and
his
stomach
was
a
nest
of
snakes
twining
and
snapping
at
each
other.
If
he
crept
back
to
Winterfell
empty-handed,
he
might
as
well
dress
in
motley
henceforth
and
wear
a
pointed
hat;
the
whole
north
would
know
him
for
a
fool.
And
when
my
father
hears,
and
Asha…

“M’lord
prince.”
Reek
urged
his
horse
near.
“Might
be
them
Starks
never
came
this
way.
If
I
was
them,
I
would
have
gone
north
and
east,
maybe.
To
the
Umbers.
Good
Stark
men,
they
are.
But
their
lands
are
a
long
way.
The
boys
will
shelter
someplace
nearer.
Might
be
I
know
where.”

Theon
looked
at
him
suspiciously.
“Tell
me.”

“You
know
that
old
mill,
sitting
lonely
on
the
Acorn
Water?
We
stopped
there
when
I
was
being
dragged
to
Winterfell
a
captive.
The
miller’s
wife
sold
us
hay
for
our
horses
while
that
old
knight
clucked
over
her
brats.
Might
be
the
Starks
are
hiding
there.”

Theon
knew
the
mill.
He
had
even
tumbled
the
miller’s
wife
a
time
or
two.
There
was
nothing
special
about
it,
or
her.
“Why
there?
There
are
a
dozen
villages
and
holdfasts
just
as
close.”

Amusement
shone
in
those
pale
eyes.
“Why?
Now
that’s
past
knowing.
But
they’re
there,
I
have
a
feeling.”

He
was
growing
sick
of
the
man’s
sly
answers.
His
lips
look
like
two
worms
fucking.
“What
are
you
saying?
If
you’ve
kept
some
knowledge
from
me—”

“M’lord
prince?”
Reek
dismounted,
and
beckoned
Theon
to
do
the
same.
When
they
were
both
afoot,
he
pulled
open
the
cloth
sack
he’d
fetched
from
Winterfell.
“Have
a
look
here.”

It
was
growing
hard
to
see.
Theon
thrust
his
hand
into
the
sack
impatiently,
groping
amongst
soft
fur
and
rough
scratchy
wool.
A
sharp
point
pricked
his
skin,
and
his
fingers
closed
around
something
cold
and
hard.
He
drew
out
a
wolf’s-head
brooch,
silver
and
jet.
Understanding
came
suddenly.
His
hand
closed
into
a
fist.
“Gelmarr,”
he
said,
wondering
whom
he
could
trust.
None
of
them.
“Aggar.
Rednose.
With
us.
The
rest
of
you
may
return
to
Winterfell
with
the
hounds.
I’ll
have
no
further
need
of
them.
I
know
where
Bran
and
Rickon
are
hiding
now.”

“Prince
Theon,”
Maester
Luwin
entreated,
“you
will
remember
your
promise?
Mercy,
you
said.”

“Mercy
was
for
this
morning,”
said
Theon.
It
is
better
to
be
feared
than
laughed
at.
“Before
they
made
me
angry.”





JON

They
could
see
the
fire
in
the
night,
glimmering
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
like
a
fallen
star.
It
burned
redder
than
the
other
stars,
and
did
not
twinkle,
though
sometimes
it
flared
up
bright
and
sometimes
dwindled
down
to
no
more
than
a
distant
spark,
dull
and
faint.

Half
a
mile
ahead
and
two
thousand
feet
up,
Jon
judged,
and
perfectly
placed
to
see
anything
moving
in
the
pass
below.

“Watchers
in
the
Skirling
Pass,”
wondered
the
oldest
among
them.
In
the
spring
of
his
youth,
he
had
been
squire
to
a
king,
so
the
black
brothers
still
called
him
Squire
Dalbridge.
“What
is
it
Mance
Rayder
fears,
I
wonder?”

“If
he
knew
they’d
lit
a
fire,
he’d
flay
the
poor
bastards,”
said
Ebben,
a
squat
bald
man
muscled
like
a
bag
of
rocks.

“Fire
is
life
up
here,”
said
Qhorin
Halfhand,
“but
it
can
be
death
as
well.”
By
his
command,
they’d
risked
no
open
flames
since
entering
the
mountains.
They
ate
cold
salt
beef,
hard
bread,
and
harder
cheese,
and
slept
clothed
and
huddled
beneath
a
pile
of
cloaks
and
furs,
grateful
for
each
other’s
warmth.
It
made
Jon
remember
cold
nights
long
ago
at
Winterfell,
when
he’d
shared
a
bed
with
his
brothers.
These
men
were
brothers
too,
though
the
bed
they
shared
was
stone
and
earth.

“They’ll
have
a
horn,”
said
Stonesnake.

The
Halfhand
said,
“A
horn
they
must
not
blow.”

“That’s
a
long
cruel
climb
by
night,”
Ebben
said
as
he
eyed
the
distant
spark
through
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
that
sheltered
them.
The
sky
was
cloudless,
the
jagged
mountains
rising
black
on
black
until
the
very
top,
where
their
cold
crowns
of
snow
and
ice
shone
palely
in
the
moonlight.

“And
a
longer
fall,”
said
Qhorin
Halfhand.
“Two
men,
I
think.
There
are
like
to
be
two
up
there,
sharing
the
watch.”

“Me.”
The
ranger
they
called
Stonesnake
had
already
shown
that
he
was
the
best
climber
among
them.
It
would
have
to
be
him.

“And
me,”
said
Jon
Snow.

Qhorin
Halfhand
looked
at
him.
Jon
could
hear
the
wind
keening
as
it
shivered
through
the
high
pass
above
them.
One
of
the
garrons
whickered
and
pawed
at
the
thin
stony
soil
of
the
hollow
where
they
had
taken
shelter.
“The
wolf
will
remain
with
us,”
Qhorin
said.
“White
fur
is
seen
too
easily
by
moonlight.”
He
turned
to
Stonesnake.
“When
it’s
done,
throw
down
a
burning
brand.
We’ll
come
when
we
see
it
fall.”

“No
better
time
to
start
than
now,”
said
Stonesnake.

They
each
took
a
long
coil
of
rope.
Stonesnake
carried
a
bag
of
iron
spikes
as
well,
and
a
small
hammer
with
its
head
wrapped
in
thick
felt.
Their
garrons
they
left
behind,
along
with
their
helms,
mail,
and
Ghost.
Jon
knelt
and
let
the
direwolf
nuzzle
him
before
they
set
off.
“Stay,”
he
commanded.
“I’ll
be
back
for
you.”

Stonesnake
took
the
lead.
He
was
a
short
wiry
man,
near
fifty
and
grey
of
beard
but
stronger
than
he
seemed,
and
he
had
the
best
night
eyes
of
anyone
Jon
had
ever
known.
He
needed
them
tonight.
By
day
the
mountains
were
blue-grey,
brushed
with
frost,
but
once
the
sun
vanished
behind
the
jagged
peaks
they
turned
black.
Now
the
rising
moon
had
linmed
them
in
white
and
silver.

The
black
brothers
moved
through
black
shadows
amidst
black
rocks,
working
their
way
up
a
steep,
twisting
trail
as
their
breath
frosted
in
the
black
air.
Jon
felt
almost
naked
without
his
mail,
but
he
did
not
miss
its
weight.
This
was
hard
going,
and
slow.
To
hurry
here
was
to
risk
a
broken
ankle
or
worse.
Stonesnake
seemed
to
know
where
to
put
his
feet
as
if
by
instinct,
but
Jon
needed
to
be
more
careful
on
the
broken,
uneven
ground.

The
Skirling
Pass
was
really
a
series
of
passes,
a
long
twisting
course
that
went
up
around
a
succession
of
icy
wind-carved
peaks
and
down
through
hidden
valleys
that
seldom
saw
the
sun.
Apart
from
his
companions,
Jon
had
glimpsed
no
living
man
since
they’d
left
the
wood
behind
and
begun
to
make
their
way
upward.
The
Frostfangs
were
as
cruel
as
any
place
the
gods
had
made,
and
as
inimical
to
men.
The
wind
cut
like
a
knife
up
here,
and
shrilled
in
the
night
like
a
mother
mourning
her
slain
children.
What
few
trees
they
saw
were
stunted,
grotesque
things
growing
sideways
out
of
cracks
and
fissures.
Tumbled
shelves
of
rock
often
overhung
the
trail,
fringed
with
hanging
icicles
that
looked
like
long
white
teeth
from
a
distance.

Yet
even
so,
Jon
Snow
was
not
sorry
he
had
come.
There
were
wonders
here
as
well.
He
had
seen
sunlight
flashing
on
icy
thin
waterfalls
as
they
plunged
over
the
lips
of
sheer
stone
cliffs,
and
a
mountain
meadow
full
of
autumn
wildflowers,
blue
coldsnaps
and
bright
scarlet
frostfires
and
stands
of
piper’s
grass
in
russet
and
gold.
He
had
peered
down
ravines
so
deep
and
black
they
seemed
certain
to
end
in
some
hell,
and
he
had
ridden
his
garron
over
a
wind-eaten
bridge
of
natural
stone
with
nothing
but
sky
to
either
side.
Eagles
nested
in
the
heights
and
came
down
to
hunt
the
valleys,
circling
effortlessly
on
great
blue-grey
wings
that
seemed
almost
part
of
the
sky.
Once
he
had
watched
a
shadowcat
stalk
a
ram,
flowing
down
the
mountainside
like
liquid
smoke
until
it
was
ready
to
pounce.

Now
it
is
our
turn
to
pounce.
He
wished
he
could
move
as
sure
and
silent
as
that
shadowcat,
and
kill
as
quickly.
Longclaw
was
sheathed
across
his
back,
but
he
might
not
have
room
to
use
it.
He
carried
dirk
and
dagger
for
closer
work.
They
will
have
weapons
as
well,
and
I
am
not
armored.
He
wondered
who
would
prove
the
shadowcat
by
night’s
end,
and
who
the
ram.

For
a
long
way
they
stayed
to
the
trail,
following
its
twists
and
turns
as
it
snaked
along
the
side
of
the
mountain,
upward,
ever
upward.
Sometimes
the
mountain
folded
back
on
itself
and
they
lost
sight
of
the
fire,
but
soon
or
late
it
would
always
reappear.
The
path
Stonesnake
chose
would
never
have
served
for
the
horses.
In
places
Jon
had
to
put
his
back
to
the
cold
stone
and
shuffle
along
sideways
like
a
crab,
inch
by
inch.
Even
where
the
track
widened
it
was
treacherous;
there
were
cracks
big
enough
to
swallow
a
man’s
leg,
rubble
to
stumble
over,
hollow
places
where
the
water
pooled
by
day
and
froze
hard
by
night.
One
step
and
then
another,
Jon
told
himself.
One
step
and
then
another,
and
I
will
not
fall.

He
had
not
shaved
since
leaving
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men,
and
the
hair
on
his
lip
was
soon
stiff
with
frost.
Two
hours
into
the
climb,
the
wind
kicked
up
so
fiercely
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hunch
down
and
cling
to
the
rock,
praying
he
would
not
be
blown
off
the
mountain.
One
step
and
then
another,
he
resumed
when
the
gale
subsided.
One
step
and
then
another,
and
I
will
not
fall.

Soon
they
were
high
enough
so
that
looking
down
was
best
not
considered.
There
was
nothing
below
but
yawning
blackness,
nothing
above
but
moon
and
stars.
“The
mountain
is
your
mother,”
Stonesnake
had
told
him
during
an
easier
climb
a
few
days
past.
“Cling
to
her,
press
your
face
up
against
her
teats,
and
she
won’t
drop
you.”
Jon
had
made
a
joke
of
it,
saying
how
he’d
always
wondered
who
his
mother
was,
but
never
thought
to
find
her
in
the
Frostfangs.
It
did
not
seem
nearly
so
amusing
now.
One
step
and
then
another,
he
thought,
clinging
tight.

The
narrow
track
ended
abruptly
where
a
massive
shoulder
of
black
granite
thrust
out
from
the
side
of
the
mountain.
After
the
bright
moonlight,
its
shadow
was
so
black
that
it
felt
like
stepping
into
a
cave.
“Straight
up
here,”
the
ranger
said
in
a
quiet
voice.
“We
want
to
get
above
them.”
He
peeled
off
his
gloves,
tucked
them
through
his
belt,
tied
one
end
of
his
rope
around
his
waist,
the
other
end
around
Jon.
“Follow
me
when
the
rope
grows
taut.”
The
ranger
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
started
at
once,
moving
upward
with
fingers
and
feet,
faster
than
Jon
would
have
believed.
The
long
rope
unwound
slowly.
Jon
watched
him
closely,
making
note
of
how
he
went,
and
where
he
found
each
handhold,
and
when
the
last
loop
of
hemp
uncoiled,
he
took
off
his
own
gloves
and
followed,
much
more
slowly.

Stonesnake
had
passed
the
rope
around
the
smooth
spike
of
rock
he
was
waiting
on,
but
as
soon
as
Jon
reached
him
he
shook
it
loose
and
was
off
again.
This
time
there
was
no
convenient
cleft
when
he
reached
the
end
of
their
tether,
so
he
took
out
his
felt-headed
hammer
and
drove
a
spike
deep
into
a
crack
in
the
stone
with
a
series
of
gentle
taps.
Soft
as
the
sounds
were,
they
echoed
off
the
stone
so
loudly
that
Jon
winced
with
every
blow,
certain
that
the
wildlings
must
hear
them
too.
When
the
spike
was
secure,
Stonesnake
secured
the
rope
to
it,
and
Jon
started
after
him.
Suck
on
the
mountain’s
teat,
he
reminded
himself.
Don’t
look
down.
Keep
your
weight
above
your
feet.
Don’t
look
down.
Look
at
the
rock
in
front
of
you.
There’s
a
good
handhold,
yes.
Don’t
look
down.
I
can
catch
a
breath
on
that
ledge
there,
all
I
need
to
do
is
reach
it.
Never
look
down.

Once
his
foot
slipped
as
he
put
his
weight
on
it
and
his
heart
stopped
in
his
chest,
but
the
gods
were
good
and
he
did
not
fall.
He
could
feel
the
cold
seeping
off
the
rock
into
his
fingers,
but
he
dared
not
don
his
gloves;
gloves
would
slip,
no
matter
how
tight
they
seemed,
cloth
and
fur
moving
between
skin
and
stone,
and
up
here
that
could
kill
him.
His
burned
hand
was
stiffening
up
on
him,
and
soon
it
began
to
ache.
Then
he
ripped
open
his
thumbnail
somehow,
and
after
that
he
left
smears
of
blood
wherever
he
put
his
hand.
He
hoped
he
still
had
all
his
fingers
by
the
end
of
the
climb.

Up
they
went,
and
up,
and
up,
black
shadows
creeping
across
the
moonlit
wall
of
rock.
Anyone
down
on
the
floor
of
the
pass
could
have
seen
them
easily,
but
the
mountain
hid
them
from
the
view
of
the
wildlings
by
their
fire.
They
were
close
now,
though.
Jon
could
sense
it.
Even
so,
he
did
not
think
of
the
foes
who
were
waiting
for
him,
all
unknowing,
but
of
his
brother
at
Winterfell.
Bran
used
to
love
to
climb.
I
wish
I
had
a
tenth
part
of
his
courage.

The
wall
was
broken
two-thirds
of
the
way
up
by
a
crooked
fissure
of
icy
stone.
Stonesnake
reached
down
a
hand
to
help
him
up.
He
had
donned
his
gloves
again,
so
Jon
did
the
same.
The
ranger
moved
his
head
to
the
left,
and
the
two
of
them
crawled
along
the
shelf
three
hundred
yards
or
more,
until
they
could
see
the
dull
orange
glow
beyond
the
lip
of
the
cliff.

The
wildlings
had
built
their
watchfire
in
a
shallow
depression
above
the
narrowest
part
of
the
pass,
with
a
sheer
drop
below
and
rock
behind
to
shelter
them
from
the
worst
of
the
wind.
That
same
windbreak
allowed
the
black
brothers
to
crawl
within
a
few
feet
of
them,
creeping
along
on
their
bellies
until
they
were
looking
down
on
the
men
they
must
kill.

One
was
asleep,
curled
up
tight
and
buried
beneath
a
great
mound
of
skins.
Jon
could
see
nothing
of
him
but
his
hair,
bright
red
in
the
firelight.
The
second
sat
close
to
the
flames,
feeding
them
twigs
and
branches
and
complaining
of
the
wind
in
a
querulous
tone.
The
third
watched
the
pass,
though
there
was
little
to
see,
only
a
vast
bowl
of
darkness
ringed
by
the
snowy
shoulders
of
the
mountains.
It
was
the
watcher
who
wore
the
horn.

Three.
For
a
moment
Jon
was
uncertain.
There
was
only
supposed
to
be
two.
One
was
asleep,
though.
And
whether
there
was
two
or
three
or
twenty,
he
still
must
do
what
he
had
come
to
do.
Stonesnake
touched
his
arm,
pointed
at
the
wildling
with
the
horn.
Jon
nodded
toward
the
one
by
the
fire.
It
felt
queer,
picking
a
man
to
kill.
Half
the
days
of
his
life
had
been
spent
with
sword
and
shield,
training
for
this
moment.
Did
Robb
feel
this
way
before
his
first
battle?
he
wondered,
but
there
was
no
time
to
ponder
the
question.
Stonesnake
moved
as
fast
as
his
namesake,
leaping
down
on
the
wildlings
in
a
rain
of
pebbles.
Jon
slid
Longclaw
from
its
sheath
and
followed.

It
all
seemed
to
happen
in
a
heartbeat.
Afterward
Jon
could
admire
the
courage
of
the
wildling
who
reached
first
for
his
horn
instead
of
his
blade.
He
got
it
to
his
lips,
but
before
he
could
sound
it
Stonesnake
knocked
the
horn
aside
with
a
swipe
of
his
shortsword.
Jon’s
man
leapt
to
his
feet,
thrusting
at
his
face
with
a
burning
brand.
He
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
flames
as
he
flinched
back.
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
he
saw
the
sleeper
stirring,
and
knew
he
must
finish
his
man
quick.
When
the
brand
swung
again,
he
bulled
into
it,
swinging
the
bastard
sword
with
both
hands.
The
Valyrian
steel
sheared
through
leather,
fur,
wool,
and
flesh,
but
when
the
wildling
fell
he
twisted,
ripping
the
sword
from
Jon’s
grasp.
On
the
ground
the
sleeper
sat
up
beneath
his
furs.
Jon
slid
his
dirk
free,
grabbing
the
man
by
the
hair
and
jamming
the
point
of
the
knife
up
under
his
chin
as
he
reached
for
his—no,
her—

His
hand
froze.
“A
girl.”

“A
watcher,”
said
Stonesnake.
“A
wildling.
Finish
her.”

Jon
could
see
fear
and
fire
in
her
eyes.
Blood
ran
down
her
white
throat
from
where
the
point
of
his
dirk
had
pricked
her.
One
thrust
and
it’s
done,
he
told
himself.
He
was
so
close
he
could
smell
onion
on
her
breath.
She
is
no
older
than
I
am.
Something
about
her
made
him
think
of
Arya,
though
they
looked
nothing
at
all
alike.
“Will
you
yield?”
he
asked,
giving
the
dirk
a
half
turn.
And
if
she
doesn’t?

“I
yield.”
Her
words
steamed
in
the
cold
air.

“You’re
our
captive,
then.”
He
pulled
the
dirk
away
from
the
soft
skin
of
her
throat.

“Qhorin
said
nothing
of
taking
captives,”
said
Stonesnake.

“He
never
said
not
to.”
Jon
let
go
his
grip
on
the
girl’s
hair,
and
she
scuttled
backward,
away
from
them.

“She’s
a
spearwife.”
Stonesnake
gestured
at
the
long-hafted
axe
that
lay
beside
her
sleeping
furs.
“She
was
reaching
for
that
when
you
grabbed
her.
Give
her
half
a
chance
and
she’ll
bury
it
between
your
eyes.”

“I
won’t
give
her
half
a
chance.”
Jon
kicked
the
axe
well
out
of
the
girl’s
reach.
“Do
you
have
a
name?”

“Ygritte.”
Her
hand
rubbed
at
her
throat
and
came
away
bloody.
She
stared
at
the
wetness.

Sheathing
his
dirk,
he
wrenched
Longclaw
free
from
the
body
of
the
man
he’d
killed.
“You
are
my
captive,
Ygritte.”

“I
gave
you
my
name.”

“I’m
Jon
Snow.”

She
flinched.
“An
evil
name.”

“A
bastard
name,”
he
said.
“My
father
was
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell.”

The
girl
watched
him
warily,
but
Stonesnake
gave
a
mordant
chuckle.
“It’s
the
captive
supposed
to
tell
things,
remember?”
The
ranger
thrust
a
long
branch
into
the
fire.
“Not
that
she
will.
I’ve
known
wildlings
to
bite
off
their
own
tongues
before
they’d
answer
a
question.”
When
the
end
of
the
branch
was
blazing
merrily,
he
took
two
steps
and
flung
it
out
over
the
pass.
It
fell
through
the
night
spinning
until
it
was
lost
to
sight.

“You
ought
to
burn
them
you
killed,”
said
Ygritte.

“Need
a
bigger
fire
for
that,
and
big
fires
burn
bright.”
Stonesnake
turned,
his
eyes
scanning
the
black
distance
for
any
spark
of
light.
“Are
there
more
wildlings
close
by,
is
that
it?”

“Burn
them,”
the
girl
repeated
stubbornly,
“or
it
might
be
you’ll
need
them
swords
again.”

Jon
remembered
dead
Othor
and
his
cold
black
hands.
“Maybe
we
should
do
as
she
says.”

“There
are
other
ways.”
Stonesnake
knelt
beside
the
man
he’d
slain,
stripped
him
of
cloak
and
boots
and
belt
and
vest,
then
hoisted
the
body
over
one
thin
shoulder
and
carried
it
to
the
edge.
He
grunted
as
he
tossed
it
over.
A
moment
later
they
heard
a
wet,
heavy
smack
well
below
them.
By
then
the
ranger
had
the
second
body
down
to
the
skin
and
was
dragging
it
by
the
arms.
Jon
took
the
feet
and
together
they
flung
the
dead
man
out
in
the
blackness
of
the
night.

Ygritte
watched
and
said
nothing.
She
was
older
than
he’d
thought
at
first,
Jon
realized;
maybe
as
old
as
twenty,
but
short
for
her
age,
bandy-legged,
with
a
round
face,
small
hands,
and
a
pug
nose.
Her
shaggy
mop
of
red
hair
stuck
out
in
all
directions.
She
looked
plump
as
she
crouched
there,
but
most
of
that
was
layers
of
fur
and
wool
and
leather.
Underneath
all
that
she
could
be
as
skinny
as
Arya.

“Were
you
sent
to
watch
for
us?”
Jon
asked
her.

“You,
and
others.”

Stonesnake
warmed
his
hands
over
the
fire.
“What
waits
beyond
the
pass?”

“The
free
folk.”

“How
many?”

“Hundreds
and
thousands.
More
than
you
ever
saw,
crow.”
She
smiled.
Her
teeth
were
crooked,
but
very
white.

She
doesn’t
know
how
many.
“Why
come
here?”

Ygritte
fell
silent.

“What’s
in
the
Frostfangs
that
your
king
could
want?
You
can’t
stay
here,
there’s
no
food.”

She
turned
her
face
away
from
him.

“Do
you
mean
to
march
on
the
Wall?
When?”

She
stared
at
the
flames
as
if
she
could
not
hear
him.

“Do
you
know
anything
of
my
uncle,
Benjen
Stark?”

Ygritte
ignored
him.
Stonesnake
laughed.
“if
she
spits
out
her
tongue,
don’t
say
I
didn’t
warn
you.”

A
low
rumbling
growl
echoed
off
the
rock.
Shadowcat,
Jon
knew
at
once.
As
he
rose
he
heard
another,
closer
at
hand.
He
pulled
his
sword
and
turned,
listening.

“They
won’t
trouble
us,”
Ygritte
said.
“It’s
the
dead
they’ve
come
for.
Cats
can
smell
blood
six
miles
off.
They’ll
stay
near
the
bodies
till
they’ve
eaten
every
last
stringy
shred
o’
meat,
and
cracked
the
bones
for
the
marrow.”

Jon
could
hear
the
sounds
of
their
feeding
echoing
off
the
rocks.
It
gave
him
an
uneasy
feeling.
The
warmth
of
the
fire
made
him
realize
how
bone-tired
he
was,
but
he
dared
not
sleep.
He
had
taken
a
captive,
and
it
was
on
him
to
guard
her.
“Were
they
your
kin?”
he
asked
her
quietly.
“The
two
we
killed?”

“No
more
than
you
are.”

“Me?”
He
frowned.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“You
said
you
were
the
Bastard
o’
Winterfell.”

“I
am.”

“Who
was
your
mother?”

“Some
woman.
Most
of
them
are.”
Someone
had
said
that
to
him
once.
He
did
not
remember
who.

She
smiled
again,
a
flash
of
white
teeth.
“And
she
never
sung
you
the
song
o’
the
winter
rose?”

“I
never
knew
my
mother.
Or
any
such
song.”

“Bael
the
Bard
made
it,”
said
Ygritte.
“He
was
King-beyond-the-Wall
a
long
time
back.
All
the
free
folk
know
his
songs,
but
might
be
you
don’t
sing
them
in
the
south.”

“Winterfell’s
not
in
the
south,”
Jon
objected.

“Yes
it
is.
Everything
below
the
Wall’s
south
to
us.”

He
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
“I
suppose
it’s
all
in
where
you’re
standing.”

“Aye,”
Ygritte
agreed.
“It
always
is.”

“Tell
me,”
Jon
urged
her.
It
would
be
hours
before
Qhorin
came
up,
and
a
story
would
help
keep
him
awake.
“I
want
to
hear
this
tale
of
yours.”

“Might
be
you
won’t
like
it
much.”

“I’ll
hear
it
all
the
same.”

“Brave
black
crow,”
she
mocked.
“Well,
long
before
he
was
king
over
the
free
folk,
Bael
was
a
great
raider.”

Stonesnake
gave
a
snort.
“A
murderer,
robber,
and
raper,
is
what
you
mean.”

“That’s
all
in
where
you’re
standing
too,”
Ygritte
said.
“The
Stark
in
Winterfell
wanted
Bael’s
head,
but
never
could
take
him,
and
the
taste
o’
failure
galled
him.
One
day
in
his
bitterness
he
called
Bael
a
craven
who
preyed
only
on
the
weak.
When
word
o’
that
got
back,
Bael
vowed
to
teach
the
lord
a
lesson.
So
he
scaled
the
Wall,
skipped
down
the
kingsroad,
and
walked
into
Winterfell
one
winter’s
night
with
harp
in
hand,
naming
himself
Sygerrik
of
Skagos.
Sygerrik
means
‘deceiver’
in
the
Old
Tongue,
that
the
First
Men
spoke,
and
the
giants
still
speak.

“North
or
south,
singers
always
find
a
ready
welcome,
so
Bael
ate
at
Lord
Stark’s
own
table,
and
played
for
the
lord
in
his
high
seat
until
half
the
night
was
gone.
The
old
songs
he
played,
and
new
ones
he’d
made
himself,
and
he
played
and
sang
so
well
that
when
he
was
done,
the
lord
offered
to
let
him
name
his
own
reward.
‘All
I
ask
is
a
flower,’
Bael
answered,
‘the
fairest
flower
that
blooms
in
the
gardens
o’
Winterfell.’

“Now
as
it
happened
the
winter
roses
had
only
then
come
into
bloom,
and
no
flower
is
so
rare
nor
precious.
So
the
Stark
sent
to
his
glass
gardens
and
commanded
that
the
most
beautiful
o’
the
winter
roses
be
plucked
for
the
singer’s
payment.
And
so
it
was
done.
But
when
morning
come,
the
singer
had
vanished…
and
so
had
Lord
Brandon’s
maiden
daughter.
Her
bed
they
found
empty,
but
for
the
pale
blue
rose
that
Bael
had
left
on
the
pillow
where
her
head
had
lain.”

Jon
had
never
heard
this
tale
before.
“Which
Brandon
was
this
supposed
to
be?
Brandon
the
Builder
lived
in
the
Age
of
Heroes,
thousands
of
years
before
Bael.
There
was
Brandon
the
Burner
and
his
father
Brandon
the
Shipwright,
but—”

“This
was
Brandon
the
Daughterless,”
Ygritte
said
sharply.
“Would
you
hear
the
tale,
or
no?”

He
scowled.
“Go
on.”

“Lord
Brandon
had
no
other
children.
At
his
behest,
the
black
crows
flew
forth
from
their
castles
in
the
hundreds,
but
nowhere
could
they
find
any
sign
o’
Bael
or
this
maid.
For
most
a
year
they
searched,
till
the
lord
lost
heart
and
took
to
his
bed,
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
line
o’
Starks
was
at
its
end.
But
one
night
as
he
lay
waiting
to
die,
Lord
Brandon
heard
a
child’s
cry.
He
followed
the
sound
and
found
his
daughter
back
in
her
bedchamber,
asleep
with
a
babe
at
her
breast.”

“Bael
had
brought
her
back?”

“No.
They
had
been
in
Winterfell
all
the
time,
hiding
with
the
dead
beneath
the
castle.
The
maid
loved
Bael
so
dearly
she
bore
him
a
son,
the
song
says…
though
if
truth
be
told,
all
the
maids
love
Bael
in
them
songs
he
wrote.
Be
that
as
it
may,
what’s
certain
is
that
Bael
left
the
child
in
payment
for
the
rose
he’d
plucked
unasked,
and
that
the
boy
grew
to
be
the
next
Lord
Stark.
So
there
it
is—you
have
Bael’s
blood
in
you,
same
as
me.”

“It
never
happened,”
Jon
said.

She
shrugged.
“Might
be
it
did,
might
be
it
didn’t.
It
is
a
good
song,
though.
My
mother
used
to
sing
it
to
me.
She
was
a
woman
too,
Jon
Snow.
Like
yours.”
She
rubbed
her
throat
where
his
dirk
had
cut
her.
“The
song
ends
when
they
find
the
babe,
but
there
is
a
darker
end
to
the
story.
Thirty
years
later,
when
Bael
was
King-beyond-the-Wall
and
led
the
free
folk
south,
it
was
young
Lord
Stark
who
met
him
at
the
Frozen
Ford…
and
killed
him,
for
Bael
would
not
harm
his
own
son
when
they
met
sword
to
sword.”

“So
the
son
slew
the
father
instead,”
said
Jon.

“Aye,”
she
said,
“but
the
gods
hate
kinslayers,
even
when
they
kill
unknowing.
When
Lord
Stark
returned
from
the
battle
and
his
mother
saw
Bael’s
head
upon
his
spear,
she
threw
herself
from
a
tower
in
her
grief.
Her
son
did
not
long
outlive
her.
One
o’
his
lords
peeled
the
skin
off
him
and
wore
him
for
a
cloak.”

“Your
Bael
was
a
liar,”
he
told
her,
certain
now.

“No,”
Ygritte
said,
“but
a
bard’s
truth
is
different
than
yours
or
mine.
Anyway,
you
asked
for
the
story,
so
I
told
it.”
She
turned
away
from
him,
closed
her
eyes,
and
seemed
to
sleep.

Dawn
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
arrived
together.
The
black
stones
had
turned
to
grey
and
the
eastern
sky
had
gone
indigo
when
Stonesnake
spied
the
rangers
below,
wending
their
way
upward.
Jon
woke
his
captive
and
held
her
by
the
arm
as
they
descended
to
meet
them.
Thankfully,
there
was
another
way
off
the
mountain
to
the
north
and
west,
along
paths
much
gentler
than
the
one
that
had
brought
them
up
here.
They
were
waiting
in
a
narrow
defile
when
their
brothers
appeared,
leading
their
garrons.
Ghost
raced
ahead
at
first
scent
of
them.
Jon
squatted
to
let
the
direwolf
close
his
jaws
around
his
wrist,
tugging
his
hand
back
and
forth.
It
was
a
game
they
played.
But
when
he
glanced
up,
he
saw
Ygritte
watching
with
eyes
as
wide
and
white
as
hen’s
eggs.

Qhorin
Halfhand
made
no
comment
when
he
saw
the
prisoner.
“There
were
three,”
Stonesnake
told
him.
No
more
than
that.

“We
passed
two,”
Ebben
said,
“or
what
the
cats
had
left
of
them.”
He
eyed
the
girl
sourly,
suspicion
plain
on
his
face.

“She
yielded,”
Jon
felt
compelled
to
say.

Qhorin’s
face
was
impassive.
“Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“Qhorin
Halfhand.”
The
girl
looked
half
a
child
beside
him,
but
she
faced
him
boldly.

“Tell
me
true.
If
I
fell
into
the
hands
of
your
people
and
yielded
myself,
what
would
it
win
me?”

“A
slower
death
than
elsewise.”

The
big
ranger
looked
to
Jon.
“We
have
no
food
to
feed
her,
nor
can
we
spare
a
man
to
watch
her.”

“The
way
before
us
is
perilous
enough,
lad,”
said
Squire
Dalbridge.
“One
shout
when
we
need
silence,
and
every
man
of
us
is
doomed.”

Ebben
drew
his
dagger.
“A
steel
kiss
will
keep
her
quiet.”

Jon’s
throat
was
raw.
He
looked
at
them
all
helplessly.
“She
yielded
herself
to
me.”

“Then
you
must
do
what
needs
be
done,”
Qhorin
Halfhand
said.
“You
are
the
blood
of
Winterfell
and
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”
He
looked
at
the
others.
“Come,
brothers.
Leave
him
to
it.
It
will
go
easier
for
him
if
we
do
not
watch.”
And
he
led
them
up
the
steep
twisting
trail
toward
the
pale
pink
glow
of
the
sun
where
it
broke
through
a
mountain
cleft,
and
before
very
long
only
Jon
and
Ghost
remained
with
the
wildling
girl.

He
thought
Ygritte
might
try
to
run,
but
she
only
stood
there,
waiting,
looking
at
him.
“You
never
killed
a
woman
before,
did
you?”
When
he
shook
his
head,
she
said,
“We
die
the
same
as
men.
But
you
don’t
need
to
do
it.
Mance
would
take
you,
I
know
he
would.
There’s
secret
ways.
Them
crows
would
never
catch
us.”

“I’m
as
much
a
crow
as
they
are,”
Jon
said.

She
nodded,
resigned.
“Will
you
burn
me,
after?”

“I
can’t.
The
smoke
might
be
seen.”

“That’s
so.”
She
shrugged.
“Well,
there’s
worse
places
to
end
up
than
the
belly
of
a
shadowcat.”

He
pulled
Longclaw
over
a
shoulder.
“Aren’t
you
afraid?”

“Last
night
I
was,”
she
admitted.
“But
now
the
sun’s
up.”
She
pushed
her
hair
aside
to
bare
her
neck,
and
knelt
before
him.
“Strike
hard
and
true,
crow,
or
I’ll
come
back
and
haunt
you.”

Longclaw
was
not
so
long
or
heavy
a
sword
as
his
father’s
Ice,
but
it
was
Valyrian
steel
all
the
same.
He
touched
the
edge
of
the
blade
to
mark
where
the
blow
must
fall,
and
Ygritte
shivered.
“That’s
cold,”
she
said.
“Go
on,
be
quick
about
it.”

He
raised
Longclaw
over
his
head,
both
hands
tight
around
the
grip.
One
cut,
with
all
my
weight
behind
it.
He
could
give
her
a
quick
clean
death,
at
least.
He
was
his
father’s
son.
Wasn’t
he?
Wasn’t
he?

“Do
it,”
she
urged
him
after
a
moment.
“Bastard.
Do
it.
I
can’t
stay
brave
forever.”
When
the
blow
did
not
fall
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him.

Jon
lowered
his
sword.
“Go,”
he
muttered.

Ygritte
stared.

“Now,”
he
said,
“before
my
wits
return.
Go.”

She
went.
=======
a
captive
in
some
dungeon,
a
hunted
fugitive
running
for
his
life,
or
even
dead.
No
one
seemed
to
know
for
certain;
every
traveler
told
a
different
tale,
each
more
terrifying
than
the
last.
The
heads
of
Father’s
guardsmen
were
rotting
on
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
impaled
on
spikes.
King
Robert
was
dead
at
Father’s
hands.
The
Baratheons
had
laid
siege
to
King’s
Landing.
Lord
Eddard
had
fled
south
with
the
king’s
wicked
brother
Renly.
Arya
and
Sansa
had
been
murdered
by
the
Hound.
Mother
had
killed
Tyrion
the
Imp
and
hung
his
body
from
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
marching
on
the
Eyrie,
burning
and
slaughtering
as
he
went.
One
wine-sodden
taleteller
even
claimed
that
Rhaegar
Targaryen
had
returned
from
the
dead
and
was
marshaling
a
vast
host
of
ancient
heroes
on
Dragonstone
to
reclaim
his
father’s
throne.

When
the
raven
came,
bearing
a
letter
marked
with
Father’s
own
seal
and
written
in
Sansa’s
hand,
the
cruel
truth
seemed
no
less
incredible.
Bran
would
never
forget
the
look
on
Robb’s
face
as
he
stared
at
their
sister’s
words.
“She
says
Father
conspired
at
treason
with
the
king’s
brothers,”
he
read.
“King
Robert
is
dead,
and
Mother
and
I
are
summoned
to
the
Red
Keep
to
swear
fealty
to
Joffrey.
She
says
we
must
be
loyal,
and
when
she
marries
Joffrey
she
will
plead
with
him
to
spare
our
lord
father’s
life.”
His
fingers
closed
into
a
fist,
crushing
Sansa’s
letter
between
them.
“And
she
says
nothing
of
Arya,
nothing,
not
so
much
as
a
word.
Damn
her!
What’s
wrong
with
the
girl?”

Bran
felt
all
cold
inside.
“She
lost
her
wolf,”
he
said,
weakly,
remembering
the
day
when
four
of
his
father’s
guardsmen
had
returned
from
the
south
with
Lady’s
bones.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
and
Shaggydog
had
begun
to
howl
before
they
crossed
the
drawbridge,
in
voices
drawn
and
desolate.
Beneath
the
shadow
of
the
First
Keep
was
an
ancient
lichyard,
its
headstones
spotted
with
pale
lichen,
where
the
old
Kings
of
Winter
had
laid
their
faithful
servants.
It
was
there
they
buried
Lady,
while
her
brothers
stalked
between
the
graves
like
restless
shadows.
She
had
gone
south,
and
only
her
bones
had
returned.

Their
grandfather,
old
Lord
Rickard,
had
gone
as
well,
with
his
son
Brandon
who
was
Father’s
brother,
and
two
hundred
of
his
best
men.
None
had
ever
returned.
And
Father
had
gone
south,
with
Arya
and
Sansa,
and
Jory
and
Hullen
and
Fat
Tom
and
the
rest,
and
later
Mother
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
gone,
and
they
hadn’t
come
back
either.
And
now
Robb
meant
to
go.
Not
to
King’s
Landing
and
not
to
swear
fealty,
but
to
Riverrun,
with
a
sword
in
his
hand.
And
if
their
lord
father
were
truly
a
prisoner,
that
could
mean
his
death
for
a
certainty.
It
frightened
Bran
more
than
he
could
say.

“If
Robb
has
to
go,
watch
over
him,”
Bran
entreated
the
old
gods,
as
they
watched
him
with
the
heart
tree’s
red
eyes,
“and
watch
over
his
men,
Hal
and
Quent
and
the
rest,
and
Lord
Umber
and
Lady
Mormont
and
the
other
lords.
And
Theon
too,
I
suppose.
Watch
them
and
keep
them
safe,
if
it
please
you,
gods.
Help
them
defeat
the
Lannisters
and
save
Father
and
bring
them
home.”

A
faint
wind
sighed
through
the
godswood
and
the
red
leaves
stirred
and
whispered.
Summer
bared
his
teeth.
“You
hear
them,
boy?”
a
voice
asked.

Bran
lifted
his
head.
Osha
stood
across
the
pool,
beneath
an
ancient
oak,
her
face
shadowed
by
leaves.
Even
in
irons,
the
wildling
moved
quiet
as
a
cat.
Summer
circled
the
pool,
sniffed
at
her.
The
tall
woman
flinched.

“Summer,
to
me,”
Bran
called.
The
direwolf
took
one
final
sniff,
spun,
and
bounded
back.
Bran
wrapped
his
arms
around
him.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”
He
had
not
seen
Osha
since
they’d
taken
her
captive
in
the
wolfswood,
though
he
knew
she’d
been
set
to
working
in
the
kitchens.

“They
are
my
gods
too,”
Osha
said.
“Beyond
the
Wall,
they
are
the
only
gods.”
Her
hair
was
growing
out,
brown
and
shaggy.
It
made
her
look
more
womanly,
that
and
the
simple
dress
of
brown
roughspun
they’d
given
her
when
they
took
her
mail
and
leather.
“Gage
lets
me
have
my
prayers
from
time
to
time,
when
I
feel
the
need,
and
I
let
him
do
as
he
likes
under
my
skirt,
when
he
feels
the
need.
It’s
nothing
to
me.
I
like
the
smell
of
flour
on
his
hands,
and
he’s
gentler
than
Stiv.”
She
gave
an
awkward
bow.
“I’ll
leave
you.
There’s
pots
that
want
scouring.”

“No,
stay,”
Bran
commanded
her.
“Tell
me
what
you
meant,
about
hearing
the
gods.”

Osha
studied
him.
“You
asked
them
and
they’re
answering.
Open
your
ears,
listen,
you’ll
hear.”

Bran
listened.
“It’s
only
the
wind,”
he
said
after
a
moment,
uncertain.
“The
leaves
are
rustling.”

“Who
do
you
think
sends
the
wind,
if
not
the
gods?”
She
seated
herself
across
the
pool
from
him,
clinking
faintly
as
she
moved.
Mikken
had
fixed
iron
manacles
to
her
ankles,
with
a
heavy
chain
between
them;
she
could
walk,
so
long
as
she
kept
her
strides
small,
but
there
was
no
way
for
her
to
run,
or
climb,
or
mount
a
horse.
“They
see
you,
boy.
They
hear
you
talking.
That
rustling,
that’s
them
talking
back.”

“What
are
they
saying?”

“They’re
sad.
Your
lord
brother
will
get
no
help
from
them,
not
where
he’s
going.
The
old
gods
have
no
power
in
the
south.
The
weirwoods
there
were
all
cut
down,
thousands
of
years
ago.
How
can
they
watch
your
brother
when
they
have
no
eyes?”

Bran
had
not
thought
of
that.
It
frightened
him.
If
even
the
gods
could
not
help
his
brother,
what
hope
was
there?
Maybe
Osha
wasn’t
hearing
them
right.
He
cocked
his
head
and
tried
to
listen
again.
He
thought
he
could
hear
the
sadness
now,
but
nothing
more
than
that.

The
rustling
grew
louder.
Bran
heard
muffled
footfalls
and
a
low
humming,
and
Hodor
came
blundering
out
of
the
trees,
naked
and
smiling.
“Hodor!”

“He
must
have
heard
our
voices,”
Bran
said.
“Hodor,
you
forgot
your
clothes.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
agreed.
He
was
dripping
wet
from
the
neck
down,
steaming
in
the
chill
air.
His
body
was
covered
with
brown
hair,
thick
as
a
pelt.
Between
his
legs,
his
manhood
swung
long
and
heavy.

Osha
eyed
him
with
a
sour
smile.
“Now
there’s
a
big
man,”
she
said.
“He
has
giant’s
blood
in
him,
or
I’m
the
queen.”

“Maester
Luwin
says
there
are
no
more
giants.
He
says
they’re
all
dead,
like
the
children
of
the
forest.
All
that’s
left
of
them
are
old
bones
in
the
earth
that
men
turn
up
with
plows
from
time
to
time.”

“Let
Maester
Luwin
ride
beyond
the
Wall,”
Osha
said.
“He’ll
find
giants
then,
or
they’ll
find
him.
My
brother
killed
one.
Ten
foot
tall
she
was,
and
stunted
at
that.
They’ve
been
known
to
grow
big
as
twelve
and
thirteen
feet.
Fierce
things
they
are
too,
all
hair
and
teeth,
and
the
wives
have
beards
like
their
husbands,
so
there’s
no
telling
them
apart.
The
women
take
human
men
for
lovers,
and
it’s
from
them
the
half
bloods
come.
It
goes
harder
on
the
women
they
catch.
The
men
are
so
big
they’ll
rip
a
maid
apart
before
they
get
her
with
child.”
She
grinned
at
him.
“But
you
don’t
know
what
I
mean,
do
you,
boy?”

“Yes
I
do,”
Bran
insisted.
He
understood
about
mating;
he
had
seen
dogs
in
the
yard,
and
watched
a
stallion
mount
a
mare.
But
talking
about
it
made
him
uncomfortable.
He
looked
at
Hodor.
“Go
back
and
bring
your
clothes,
Hodor,”
he
said.
“Go
dress.”

“Hodor.”
He
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come,
ducking
under
a
low-hanging
tree
limb.

He
was
awfully
big,
Bran
thought
as
he
watched
him
go.
“Are
there
truly
giants
beyond
the
Wall?”
he
asked
Osha,
uncertainly.

“Giants
and
worse
than
giants,
Lordling.
I
tried
to
tell
your
brother
when
he
asked
his
questions,
him
and
your
maester
and
that
smiley
boy
Greyjoy.
The
cold
winds
are
rising,
and
men
go
out
from
their
fires
and
never
come
back…
or
if
they
do,
they’re
not
men
no
more,
but
only
wights,
with
blue
eyes
and
cold
black
hands.
Why
do
you
think
I
run
south
with
Stiv
and
Hali
and
the
rest
of
them
fools?
Mance
thinks
he’ll
fight,
the
brave
sweet
stubborn
man,
like
the
white
walkers
were
no
more
than
rangers,
but
what
does
he
know?
He
can
call
himself
King-beyond-the-Wall
all
he
likes,
but
he’s
still
just
another
old
black
crow
who
flew
down
from
the
Shadow
Tower.
He’s
never
tasted
winter.
I
was
born
up
there,
child,
like
my
mother
and
her
mother
before
her
and
her
mother
before
her,
born
of
the
Free
Folk.
We
remember.”
Osha
stood,
her
chains
rattling
together.
“I
tried
to
tell
your
lordling
brother.
Only
yesterday,
when
I
saw
him
in
the
yard.
‘M’lord
Stark,’
I
called
to
him,
respectful
as
you
please,
but
he
looked
through
me,
and
that
sweaty
oaf
Greatjon
Umber
shoves
me
out
of
the
path.
So
be
it.
I’ll
wear
my
irons
and
hold
my
tongue.
A
man
who
won’t
listen
can’t
hear.”

“Tell
me.
Robb
will
listen
to
me,
I
know
he
will.”

“Will
he
now?
We’ll
see.
You
tell
him
this,
m’lord.
You
tell
him
he’s
bound
on
marching
the
wrong
way.
It’s
north
he
should
be
taking
his
swords.
North,
not
south.
You
hear
me?”

Bran
nodded.
“I’ll
tell
him.”

But
that
night,
when
they
feasted
in
the
Great
Hall,
Robb
was
not
with
them.
He
took
his
meal
in
the
solar
instead,
with
Lord
Rickard
and
the
Greatjon
and
the
other
lords
bannermen,
to
make
the
final
plans
for
the
long
march
to
come.
It
was
left
to
Bran
to
fill
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
table,
and
act
the
host
to
Lord
Karstark’s
sons
and
honored
friends.
They
were
already
at
their
places
when
Hodor
carried
Bran
into
the
hall
on
his
back,
and
knelt
beside
the
high
seat.
Two
of
the
serving
men
helped
lift
him
from
his
basket.
Bran
could
feel
the
eyes
of
every
stranger
in
the
hall.
It
had
grown
quiet.
“My
lords,”
Hallis
Mollen
announced,
“Brandon
Stark,
of
Winterfell.”

“I
welcome
you
to
our
fires,”
Bran
said
stiffly,
“and
offer
you
meat
and
mead
in
honor
of
our
friendship.”

Harrion
Karstark,
the
oldest
of
Lord
Rickard’s
sons,
bowed,
and
his
brothers
after
him,
yet
as
they
settled
back
in
their
places
he
heard
the
younger
two
talking
in
low
voices,
over
the
clatter
of
wine
cups.
“…sooner
die
than
live
like
that,”
muttered
one,
his
father’s
namesake
Eddard,
and
his
brother
Torrhen
said
likely
the
boy
was
broken
inside
as
well
as
out,
too
craven
to
take
his
own
life.

Broken,
Bran
thought
bitterly
as
he
clutched
his
knife.
Is
that
what
he
was
now?
Bran
the
Broken?
“I
don’t
want
to
be
broken,”
he
whispered
fiercely
to
Maester
Luwin,
who’d
been
seated
to
his
right.
“I
want
to
be
a
knight.”

“There
are
some
who
call
my
order
the
knights
of
the
mind,”
Luwin
replied.
“You
are
a
surpassing
clever
boy
when
you
work
at
it,
Bran.
Have
you
ever
thought
that
you
might
wear
a
maester’s
chain?
There
is
no
limit
to
what
you
might
learn.”

“I
want
to
learn
magic,”
Bran
told
him.
“The
crow
promised
that
I
would
fly.”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“I
can
teach
you
history,
healing,
herblore.
I
can
teach
you
the
speech
of
ravens,
and
how
to
build
a
castle,
and
the
way
a
sailor
steers
his
ship
by
the
stars.
I
can
teach
you
to
measure
the
days
and
mark
the
seasons,
and
at
the
Citadel
in
Oldtown
they
can
teach
you
a
thousand
things
more.
But,
Bran,
no
man
can
teach
you
magic.”

“The
children
could,”
Bran
said.
“The
children
of
the
forest.”
That
reminded
him
of
the
promise
he
had
made
to
Osha
in
the
godswood,
so
he
told
Luwin
what
she
had
said.

The
maester
listened
politely.
“The
wildling
woman
could
give
Old
Nan
lessons
in
telling
tales,
I
think,”
he
said
when
Bran
was
done.
“I
will
talk
with
her
again
if
you
like,
but
it
would
be
best
if
you
did
not
trouble
your
brother
with
this
folly.
He
has
more
than
enough
to
concern
him
without
fretting
over
giants
and
dead
men
in
the
woods.
It’s
the
Lannisters
who
hold
your
lord
father,
Bran,
not
the
children
of
the
forest.”
He
put
a
gentle
hand
on
Bran’s
arm.
“Think
on
what
I
said,
child.”

And
two
days
later,
as
a
red
dawn
broke
across
a
windswept
sky,
Bran
found
himself
in
the
yard
beneath
the
gatehouse,
strapped
atop
Dancer
as
he
said
his
farewells
to
his
brother.

“You
are
the
lord
in
Winterfell
now,”
Robb
told
him.
He
was
mounted
on
a
shaggy
grey
stallion,
his
shield
hung
from
the
horse’s
side;
wood
banded
with
iron,
white
and
grey,
and
on
it
the
snarling
face
of
a
direwolf.
His
brother
wore
grey
chainmail
over
bleached
leathers,
sword
and
dagger
at
his
waist,
a
fur-trimmed
cloak
across
his
shoulders.
“You
must
take
my
place,
as
I
took
Father’s,
until
we
come
home.”

“I
know,”
Bran
replied
miserably.
He
had
never
felt
so
little
or
alone
or
scared.
He
did
not
know
how
to
be
a
lord.

“Listen
to
Maester
Luwin’s
counsel,
and
take
care
of
Rickon.
Tell
him
that
I’ll
be
back
as
soon
as
the
fighting
is
done.”

Rickon
had
refused
to
come
down.
He
was
up
in
his
chamber,
redeyed
and
defiant.
“No!”
he’d
screamed
when
Bran
had
asked
if
he
didn’t
want
to
say
farewell
to
Robb.
“NO
farewell!”

“I
told
him,”
Bran
said.
“He
says
no
one
ever
comes
back.”

“He
can’t
be
a
baby
forever.
He’s
a
Stark,
and
near
four.”
Robb
sighed.
“Well,
Mother
will
be
home
soon.
And
I’ll
bring
back
Father,
I
promise.”

He
wheeled
his
courser
around
and
trotted
away.
Grey
Wind
followed,
loping
beside
the
warhorse,
lean
and
swift.
Hallis
Mollen
went
before
them
through
the
gate,
carrying
the
rippling
white
banner
of
House
Stark
atop
a
high
standard
of
grey
ash.
Theon
Greyjoy
and
the
Greatjon
fell
in
on
either
side
of
Robb,
and
their
knights
formed
up
in
a
double
column
behind
them,
steel-tipped
lances
glinting
in
the
sun.

Uncomfortably,
he
remembered
Osha’s
words.
He’s
marching
the
wrong
way,
he
thought.
For
an
instant
he
wanted
to
gallop
after
him
and
shout
a
warning,
but
when
Robb
vanished
beneath
the
portcullis,
the
moment
was
gone.

Beyond
the
castle
walls,
a
roar
of
sound
went
up.
The
foot
soldiers
and
townsfolk
were
cheering
Robb
as
he
rode
past,
Bran
knew;
cheering
for
Lord
Stark,
for
the
Lord
of
Winterfell
on
his
great
stallion,
with
his
cloak
streaming
and
Grey
Wind
racing
beside
him.
They
would
never
cheer
for
him
that
way,
he
realized
with
a
dull
ache.
He
might
be
the
lord
in
Winterfell
while
his
brother
and
father
were
gone,
but
he
was
still
Bran
the
Broken.
He
could
not
even
get
off
his
own
horse,
except
to
fall.

When
the
distant
cheers
had
faded
to
silence
and
the
yard
was
empty
at
last,
Winterfell
seemed
deserted
and
dead.
Bran
looked
around
at
the
faces
of
those
who
remained,
women
and
children
and
old
men…
and
Hodor.
The
huge
stableboy
had
a
lost
and
frightened
look
to
his
face.
“Hodor?”
he
said
sadly.

“Hodor,”
Bran
agreed,
wondering
what
it
meant.





DAENERYS

When
he
had
taken
his
pleasure,
Khal
Drogo
rose
from
their
sleeping
mats
to
tower
above
her.
His
skin
shone
dark
as
bronze
in
the
ruddy
light
from
the
brazier,
the
faint
lines
of
old
scars
visible
on
his
broad
chest.
Ink-black
hair,
loose
and
unbound,
cascaded
over
his
shoulders
and
down
his
back,
well
past
his
waist.
His
manhood
glistened
wetly.
The
khal’s
mouth
twisted
in
a
frown
beneath
the
droop
of
his
long
mustachio.
“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
has
no
need
of
iron
chairs.”

Dany
propped
herself
on
an
elbow
to
look
up
at
him,
so
tall
and
magnificent.
She
loved
his
hair
especially.
It
had
never
been
cut;
he
had
never
known
defeat.
“It
was
prophesied
that
the
stallion
will
ride
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,”
she
said.

“The
earth
ends
at
the
black
salt
sea,”
Drogo
answered
at
once.
He
wet
a
cloth
in
a
basin
of
warm
water
to
wipe
the
sweat
and
oil
from
his
skin.
“No
horse
can
cross
the
poison
water.”

“In
the
Free
Cities,
there
are
ships
by
the
thousand,”
Dany
told
him,
as
she
had
told
him
before.
“Wooden
horses
with
a
hundred
legs,
that
fly
across
the
sea
on
wings
full
of
wind.”

Khal
Drogo
did
not
want
to
hear
it.
“We
will
speak
no
more
of
wooden
horses
and
iron
chairs.”
He
dropped
the
cloth
and
began
to
dress.
“This
day
I
will
go
to
the
grass
and
hunt,
woman
wife,”
he
announced
as
he
shrugged
into
a
painted
vest
and
buckled
on
a
wide
belt
with
heavy
medallions
of
silver,
gold,
and
bronze.

“Yes,
my
sun-and-stars,”
Dany
said.
Drogo
would
take
his
bloodriders
and
ride
in
search
of
hrakkar,
the
great
white
lion
of
the
plains.
If
they
returned
triumphant,
her
lord
husband’s
joy
would
be
fierce,
and
he
might
be
willing
to
hear
her
out.

Savage
beasts
he
did
not
fear,
nor
any
man
who
had
ever
drawn
breath,
but
the
sea
was
a
different
matter.
To
the
Dothraki,
water
that
a
horse
could
not
drink
was
something
foul;
the
heaving
grey-green
plains
of
the
ocean
filled
them
with
superstitious
loathing.
Drogo
was
a
bolder
man
than
the
other
horselords
in
half
a
hundred
ways,
she
had
found…
but
not
in
this.
If
only
she
could
get
him
onto
a
ship…

After
the
khal
and
his
bloodriders
had
ridden
off
with
their
bows,
Dany
summoned
her
handmaids.
Her
body
felt
so
fat
and
ungainly
now
that
she
welcomed
the
help
of
their
strong
arms
and
deft
hands,
whereas
before
she
had
often
been
uncomfortable
with
the
way
they
fussed
and
fluttered
about
her.
They
scrubbed
her
clean
and
dressed
her
in
sandsilk,
loose
and
flowing.
As
Doreah
combed
out
her
hair,
she
sent
Jhiqui
to
find
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.

The
knight
came
at
once.
He
wore
horsehair
leggings
and
painted
vest,
like
a
rider.
Coarse
black
hair
covered
his
thick
chest
and
muscular
arms.
“My
princess.
How
may
I
serve
you?”

“You
must
talk
to
my
lord
husband,”
Dany
said.
“Drogo
says
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
will
have
all
the
lands
of
the
earth
to
rule,
and
no
need
to
cross
the
poison
water.
He
talks
of
leading
his
khalasar
east
after
Rhaego
is
born,
to
plunder
the
lands
around
the
Jade
Sea.”

The
knight
looked
thoughtful.
“The
khal
has
never
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
he
said.
“They
are
nothing
to
him.
If
he
thinks
of
them
at
all,
no
doubt
he
thinks
of
islands,
a
few
small
cities
clinging
to
rocks
in
the
manner
of
Lorath
or
Lys,
surrounded
by
stormy
seas.
The
riches
of
the
east
must
seem
a
more
tempting
prospect.”

“But
he
must
ride
west,”
Dany
said,
despairing.
“Please,
help
me
make
him
understand.”
She
had
never
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms
either,
no
more
than
Drogo,
yet
she
felt
as
though
she
knew
them
from
all
the
tales
her
brother
had
told
her.
Viserys
had
promised
her
a
thousand
times
that
he
would
take
her
back
one
day,
but
he
was
dead
now
and
his
promises
had
died
with
him.

“The
Dothraki
do
things
in
their
own
time,
for
their
own
reasons,”
the
knight
answered.
“Have
patience,
Princess.
Do
not
make
your
brother’s
mistake.
We
will
go
home,
I
promise
you.”

Home?
The
word
made
her
feel
sad.
Ser
Jorah
had
his
Bear
Island,
but
what
was
home
to
her?
A
few
tales,
names
recited
as
solemnly
as
the
words
of
a
prayer,
the
fading
memory
of
a
red
door…
was
Vaes
Dothrak
to
be
her
home
forever?
When
she
looked
at
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen,
was
she
looking
at
her
future?

Ser
Jorah
must
have
seen
the
sadness
on
her
face.
“A
great
caravan
arrived
during
the
night,
Khaleesi.
Four
hundred
horses,
from
Pentos
by
way
of
Norvos
and
Qohor,
under
the
command
of
Merchant
Captain
Byan
Votyris.
Illyrio
may
have
sent
a
letter.
Would
you
care
to
visit
the
Western
Market?”

Dany
stirred.
“Yes,”
she
said.
“I
would
like
that.”
The
markets
came
alive
when
a
caravan
had
come
in.
You
could
never
tell
what
treasures
the
traders
might
bring
this
time,
and
it
would
be
good
to
hear
men
speaking
Valyrian
again,
as
they
did
in
the
Free
Cities.
“Irri,
have
them
prepare
a
litter.”

“I
shall
tell
your
khas,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
withdrawing.

If
Khal
Drogo
had
been
with
her,
Dany
would
have
ridden
her
silver.
Among
the
Dothraki,
mothers
stayed
on
horseback
almost
up
to
the
moment
of
birth,
and
she
did
not
want
to
seem
weak
in
her
husband’s
eyes.
But
with
the
khal
off
hunting,
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
back
on
soft
cushions
and
be
carried
across
Vaes
Dothrak,
with
red
silk
curtains
to
shield
her
from
the
sun.
Ser
Jorah
saddled
up
and
rode
beside
her,
with
the
four
young
men
of
her
khas
and
her
handmaids.

The
day
was
warm
and
cloudless,
the
sky
a
deep
blue.
When
the
wind
blew,
she
could
smell
the
rich
scents
of
grass
and
earth.
As
her
litter
passed
beneath
the
stolen
monuments,
she
went
from
sunlight
to
shadow
and
back
again.
Dany
swayed
along,
studying
the
faces
of
dead
heroes
and
forgotten
kings.
She
wondered
if
the
gods
of
burned
cities
could
still
answer
prayers.

If
I
were
not
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
thought
wistfully,
this
could
be
my
home.
She
was
khaleesi,
she
had
a
strong
man
and
a
swift
horse,
handmaids
to
serve
her,
warriors
to
keep
her
safe,
an
honored
place
in
the
dosh
khaleen
awaiting
her
when
she
grew
old…
and
in
her
womb
grew
a
son
who
would
one
day
bestride
the
world.
That
should
be
enough
for
any
woman…
but
not
for
the
dragon.
With
Viserys
gone,
Daenerys
was
the
last,
the
very
last.
She
was
the
seed
of
kings
and
conquerors,
and
so
too
the
child
inside
her.
She
must
not
forget.

The
Western
Market
was
a
great
square
of
beaten
earth
surrounded
by
warrens
of
mud-baked
brick,
animal
pens,
whitewashed
drinking
halls.
Hummocks
rose
from
the
ground
like
the
backs
of
great
subterranean
beasts
breaking
the
surface,
yawning
black
mouths
leading
down
to
cool
and
cavernous
storerooms
below.
The
interior
of
the
square
was
a
maze
of
stalls
and
crookback
aisles,
shaded
by
awnings
of
woven
grass.

A
hundred
merchants
and
traders
were
unloading
their
goods
and
setting
up
in
stalls
when
they
arrived,
yet
even
so
the
great
market
seemed
hushed
and
deserted
compared
to
the
teeming
bazaars
that
Dany
remembered
from
Pentos
and
the
other
Free
Cities.
The
caravans
made
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
from
east
and
west
not
so
much
to
sell
to
the
Dothraki
as
to
trade
with
each
other,
Ser
Jorah
had
explained.
The
riders
let
them
come
and
go
unmolested,
so
long
as
they
observed
the
peace
of
the
sacred
city,
did
not
profane
the
Mother
of
Mountains
or
the
Womb
of
the
World,
and
honored
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
with
the
traditional
gifts
of
salt,
silver,
and
seed.
The
Dothraki
did
not
truly
comprehend
this
business
of
buying
and
selling.

Dany
liked
the
strangeness
of
the
Eastern
Market
too,
with
all
its
queer
sights
and
sounds
and
smells.
She
often
spent
her
mornings
there,
nibbling
tree
eggs,
locust
pie,
and
green
noodles,
listening
to
the
high
ululating
voices
of
the
spellsingers,
gaping
at
manticores
in
silver
cages
and
immense
grey
elephants
and
the
striped
black-and-white
horses
of
the
Jogos
Nhai.
She
enjoyed
watching
all
the
people
too:
dark
solemn
Asshai’i
and
tall
pale
Qartheen,
the
bright-eyed
men
of
Yi
Ti
in
monkey-tail
hats,
warrior
maids
from
Bayasabhad,
Shamyriana,
and
Kayakayanaya
with
iron
rings
in
their
nipples
and
rubies
in
their
cheeks,
even
the
dour
and
frightening
Shadow
Men,
who
covered
their
arms
and
legs
and
chests
with
tattoos
and
hid
their
faces
behind
masks.
The
Eastern
Market
was
a
place
of
wonder
and
magic
for
Dany.

But
the
Western
Market
smelled
of
home.

As
Irri
and
Jhiqui
helped
her
from
her
litter,
she
sniffed,
and
recognized
the
sharp
odors
of
garlic
and
pepper,
scents
that
reminded
Dany
of
days
long
gone
in
the
alleys
of
Tyrosh
and
Myr
and
brought
a
fond
smile
to
her
face.
Under
that
she
smelled
the
heady
sweet
perfumes
of
Lys.
She
saw
slaves
carrying
bolts
of
intricate
Myrish
lace
and
fine
wools
in
a
dozen
rich
colors.
Caravan
guards
wandered
among
the
aisles
in
copper
helmets
and
knee-length
tunics
of
quilted
yellow
cotton,
empty
scabbards
swinging
from
their
woven
leather
belts.
Behind
one
stall
an
armorer
displayed
steel
breastplates
worked
with
gold
and
silver
in
ornate
patterns,
and
helms
hammered
in
the
shapes
of
fanciful
beasts.
Next
to
him
was
a
pretty
young
woman
selling
Lannisport
goldwork,
rings
and
brooches
and
torcs
and
exquisitely
wrought
medallions
suitable
for
belting.
A
huge
eunuch
guarded
her
stall,
mute
and
hairless,
dressed
in
sweat-stained
velvets
and
scowling
at
anyone
who
came
close.
Across
the
aisle,
a
fat
cloth
trader
from
Yi
Ti
was
haggling
with
a
Pentoshi
over
the
price
of
some
green
dye,
the
monkey
tail
on
his
hat
swaying
back
and
forth
as
he
shook
his
head.

“When
I
was
a
little
girl,
I
loved
to
play
in
the
bazaar,”
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah
as
they
wandered
down
the
shady
aisle
between
the
stalls.
“It
was
so
alive
there,
all
the
people
shouting
and
laughing,
so
many
wonderful
things
to
look
at…
though
we
seldom
had
enough
coin
to
buy
anything…
well,
except
for
a
sausage
now
and
again,
or
honeyfingers…
do
they
have
honeyfingers
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
the
kind
they
bake
in
Tyrosh?”

“Cakes,
are
they?
I
could
not
say,
Princess.”
The
knight
bowed.
“If
you
would
pardon
me
for
a
time,
I
will
seek
out
the
captain
and
see
if
he
has
letters
for
us.”

“Very
well.
I’ll
help
you
find
him.”

“There
is
no
need
for
you
to
trouble
yourself.”
Ser
Jorah
glanced
away
impatiently.
“Enjoy
the
market.
I
will
rejoin
you
when
my
business
is
concluded.”

Curious,
Dany
thought
as
she
watched
him
stride
off
through
the
throngs.
She
didn’t
see
why
she
should
not
go
with
him.
Perhaps
Ser
Jorah
meant
to
find
a
woman
after
he
met
with
the
merchant
captain.
Whores
frequently
traveled
with
the
caravans,
she
knew,
and
some
men
were
queerly
shy
about
their
couplings.
She
gave
a
shrug.
“Come,”
she
told
the
others.

Her
handmaids
trailed
along
as
Dany
resumed
her
stroll
through
the
market.
“Oh,
look,”
she
exclaimed
to
Doreah,
“those
are
the
kind
of
sausages
I
meant.”
She
pointed
to
a
stall
where
a
wizened
little
woman
was
grilling
meat
and
onions
on
a
hot
firestone.
“They
make
them
with
lots
of
garlic
and
hot
peppers.”
Delighted
with
her
discovery,
Dany
insisted
the
others
join
her
for
a
sausage.
Her
handmaids
wolfed
theirs
down
giggling
and
grinning,
though
the
men
of
her
khas
sniffed
at
the
grilled
meat
suspiciously.
“They
taste
different
than
I
remember,”
Dany
said
after
her
first
few
bites.

“In
Pentos,
I
make
them
with
pork,”
the
old
woman
said,
“but
all
my
pigs
died
on
the
Dothraki
sea.
These
are
made
of
horsemeat,
Khaleesi,
but
I
spice
them
the
same.”

“Oh.”
Dany
felt
disappointed,
but
Quaro
liked
his
sausage
so
well
he
decided
to
have
another
one,
and
Rakharo
had
to
outdo
him
and
eat
three
more,
belching
loudly.
Dany
giggled.

“You
have
not
laughed
since
your
brother
the
Khal
Rhaggat
was
crowned
by
Drogo,”
said
Irri.
“It
is
good
to
see,
Khaleesi.”

Dany
smiled
shyly.
It
was
sweet
to
laugh.
She
felt
half
a
girl
again.

They
wandered
for
half
the
morning.
She
saw
a
beautiful
feathered
cloak
from
the
Summer
Isles,
and
took
it
for
a
gift.
In
return,
she
gave
the
merchant
a
silver
medallion
from
her
belt.
That
was
how
it
was
done
among
the
Dothraki.
A
birdseller
taught
a
green-and-red
parrot
to
say
her
name,
and
Dany
laughed
again,
yet
still
refused
to
take
him.
What
would
she
do
with
a
green-and-red
parrot
in
a
khalasar?
She
did
take
a
dozen
flasks
of
scented
oils,
the
perfumes
of
her
childhood;
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
sniff
them
and
she
could
see
the
big
house
with
the
red
door
once
more.
When
Doreah
looked
longingly
at
a
fertility
charm
at
a
magician’s
booth,
Dany
took
that
too
and
gave
it
to
the
handmaid,
thinking
that
now
she
should
find
something
for
Irri
and
Jhiqui
as
well.

Turning
a
corner,
they
came
upon
a
wine
merchant
offering
thimble-sized
cups
of
his
wares
to
the
passersby.
“Sweet
reds,”
he
cried
in
fluent
Dothraki,
“I
have
sweet
reds,
from
Lys
and
Volantis
and
the
Arbor.
Whites
from
Lys,
Tyroshi
pear
brandy,
firewine,
pepperwine,
the
pale
green
nectars
of
Myr.
Smokeberry
browns
and
Andalish
sours,
I
have
them,
I
have
them.”
He
was
a
small
man,
slender
and
handsome,
his
flaxen
hair
curled
and
perfumed
after
the
fashion
of
Lys.
When
Dany
paused
before
his
stall,
he
bowed
low.
“A
taste
for
the
khaleesi?
I
have
a
sweet
red
from
Dorne,
my
lady,
it
sings
of
plums
and
cherries
and
rich
dark
oak.
A
cask,
a
cup,
a
swallow?
One
taste,
and
you
will
name
your
child
after
me.”

Dany
smiled.
“My
son
has
his
name,
but
I
will
try
your
summerwine,”
she
said
in
Valyrian,
Valyrian
as
they
spoke
it
in
the
Free
Cities.
The
words
felt
strange
on
her
tongue,
after
so
long.
“Just
a
taste,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

The
merchant
must
have
taken
her
for
Dothraki,
with
her
clothes
and
her
oiled
hair
and
sun-browned
skin.
When
she
spoke,
he
gaped
at
her
in
astonishment.
“My
lady,
you
are…
Tyroshi?
Can
it
be
so?”

“My
speech
may
be
Tyroshi,
and
my
garb
Dothraki,
but
I
am
of
Westeros,
of
the
Sunset
Kingdoms,”
Dany
told
him.

Doreah
stepped
up
beside
her.
“You
have
the
honor
to
address
Daenerys
of
the
House
Targaryen,
Daenerys
Stormborn,
khaleesi
of
the
riding
men
and
princess
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”

The
wine
merchant
dropped
to
his
knees.
“Princess,”
he
said,
bowing
his
head.

“Rise,”
Dany
commanded
him.
“I
would
still
like
to
taste
that
summerwine
you
spoke
of.”

The
man
bounded
to
his
feet.
“That?
Dornish
swill.
It
is
not
worthy
of
a
princess.
I
have
a
dry
red
from
the
Arbor,
crisp
and
delectable.
Please,
let
me
give
you
a
cask.”

Khal
Drogo’s
visits
to
the
Free
Cities
had
given
him
a
taste
for
good
wine,
and
Dany
knew
that
such
a
noble
vintage
would
please
him.
“You
honor
me,
ser,”
she
murmured
sweetly.

“The
honor
is
mine.”
The
merchant
rummaged
about
in
the
back
of
his
stall
and
produced
a
small
oaken
cask.
Burned
into
the
wood
was
a
cluster
of
grapes.
“The
Redwyne
sigil,”
he
said,
pointing,
“for
the
Arbor.
There
is
no
finer
drink.”

“Khal
Drogo
and
I
will
share
it
together.
Aggo,
take
this
back
to
my
litter,
if
you’d
be
so
kind.”
The
wineseller
beamed
as
the
Dothraki
hefted
the
cask.

She
did
not
realize
that
Ser
Jorah
had
returned
until
she
heard
the
knight
say,
“No.”
His
voice
was
strange,
brusque.
“Aggo,
put
down
that
cask.”

Aggo
looked
at
Dany.
She
gave
a
hesitant
nod.
“Ser
Jorah,
is
something
wrong?”

“I
have
a
thirst.
Open
it,
wineseller.”

The
merchant
frowned.
“The
wine
is
for
the
khaleesi,
not
for
the
likes
of
you,
ser.”

Ser
Jorah
moved
closer
to
the
stall.
“If
you
don’t
open
it,
I’ll
crack
it
open
with
your
head.”
He
carried
no
weapons
here
in
the
sacred
city,
save
his
hands—yet
his
hands
were
enough,
big,
hard,
dangerous,
his
knuckles
covered
with
coarse
dark
hairs.
The
wineseller
hesitated
a
moment,
then
took
up
his
hammer
and
knocked
the
plug
from
the
cask.

“Pour,”
Ser
Jorah
commanded.
The
four
young
warriors
of
Dany’s
khas
arrayed
themselves
behind
him,
frowning,
watching
with
their
dark,
almond-shaped
eyes.

“It
would
be
a
crime
to
drink
this
rich
a
wine
without
letting
it
breathe.”
The
wineseller
had
not
put
his
hammer
down.

Jhogo
reached
for
the
whip
coiled
at
his
belt,
but
Dany
stopped
him
with
a
light
touch
on
the
arm.
“Do
as
Ser
Jorah
says,”
she
said.
People
were
stopping
to
watch.

The
man
gave
her
a
quick,
sullen
glance.
“As
the
princess
commands.”
He
had
to
set
aside
his
hammer
to
lift
the
cask.
He
filled
two
thimble-sized
tasting
cups,
pouring
so
deftly
he
did
not
spill
a
drop.

Ser
Jorah
lifted
a
cup
and
sniffed
at
the
wine,
frowning.

“Sweet,
isn’t
it?”
the
wineseller
said,
smiling.
“Can
you
smell
the
fruit,
ser?
The
perfume
of
the
Arbor.
Taste
it,
my
lord,
and
tell
me
it
isn’t
the
finest,
richest
wine
that’s
ever
touched
your
tongue.”

Ser
Jorah
offered
him
the
cup.
“You
taste
it
first.”

“Me?”
The
man
laughed.
“I
am
not
worthy
of
this
vintage,
my
lord.
And
it’s
a
poor
wine
merchant
who
drinks
up
his
own
wares.”
His
smile
was
amiable,
yet
she
could
see
the
sheen
of
sweat
on
his
brow.

“You
will
drink,”
Dany
said,
cold
as
ice.
“Empty
the
cup,
or
I
will
tell
them
to
hold
you
down
while
Ser
Jorah
pours
the
whole
cask
down
your
throat.”

The
wineseller
shrugged,
reached
for
the
cup…
and
grabbed
the
cask
instead,
flinging
it
at
her
with
both
hands.
Ser
Jorah
bulled
into
her,
knocking
her
out
of
the
way.
The
cask
bounced
off
his
shoulder
and
smashed
open
on
the
ground.
Dany
stumbled
and
lost
her
feet.
“No,”
she
screamed,
thrusting
her
hands
out
to
break
her
fall…
and
Doreah
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
wrenched
her
backward,
so
she
landed
on
her
legs
and
not
her
belly.

The
trader
vaulted
over
the
stall,
darting
between
Aggo
and
Rakharo.
Quaro
reached
for
an
arakh
that
was
not
there
as
the
blond
man
slammed
him
aside.
He
raced
down
the
aisle.
Dany
heard
the
snap
of
Jhogo’s
whip,
saw
the
leather
lick
out
and
coil
around
the
wineseller’s
leg.
The
man
sprawled
face
first
in
the
dirt.

A
dozen
caravan
guards
had
come
running.
With
them
was
the
master
himself,
Merchant
Captain
Byan
Votyris,
a
diminutive
Norvoshi
with
skin
like
old
leather
and
a
bristling
blue
mustachio
that
swept
up
to
his
ears.
He
seemed
to
know
what
had
happened
without
a
word
being
spoken.
“Take
this
one
away
to
await
the
pleasure
of
the
khal,”
he
commanded,
gesturing
at
the
man
on
the
ground.
Two
guards
hauled
the
wineseller
to
his
feet.
“His
goods
I
gift
to
you
as
well,
Princess,”
the
merchant
captain
went
on.
“Small
token
of
regret,
that
one
of
mine
would
do
this
thing.”

Doreah
and
Jhiqui
helped
Dany
back
to
her
feet.
The
poisoned
wine
was
leaking
from
the
broken
cask
into
the
dirt.
“How
did
you
know?”
she
asked
Ser
Jorah,
trembling.
“How?”

“I
did
not
know,
Khaleesi,
not
until
the
man
refused
to
drink,
but
once
I
read
Magister
Illyrio’s
letter,
I
feared.”
His
dark
eyes
swept
over
the
faces
of
the
strangers
in
the
market.
“Come.
Best
not
to
talk
of
it
here.”

Dany
was
near
tears
as
they
carried
her
back.
The
taste
in
her
mouth
was
one
she
had
known
before:
fear.
For
years
she
had
lived
in
terror
of
Viserys,
afraid
of
waking
the
dragon.
This
was
even
worse.
It
was
not
just
for
herself
that
she
feared
now,
but
for
her
baby.
He
must
have
sensed
her
fright,
for
he
moved
restlessly
inside
her.
Dany
stroked
the
swell
of
her
belly
gently,
wishing
she
could
reach
him,
touch
him,
soothe
him.
“You
are
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
little
one,”
she
whispered
as
her
litter
swayed
along,
curtains
drawn
tight.
“You
are
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
and
the
dragon
does
not
fear.”

Under
the
hollow
hummock
of
earth
that
was
her
home
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
Dany
ordered
them
to
leave
her—all
but
Ser
Jorah.
“Tell
me,”
she
commanded
as
she
lowered
herself
onto
her
cushions.
“Was
it
the
Usurper?”

“Yes.”
The
knight
drew
out
a
folded
parchment.
“A
letter
to
Viserys,
from
Magister
Illyrio.
Robert
Baratheon
offers
lands
and
lordships
for
your
death,
or
your
brother’s.”

“My
brother?”
Her
sob
was
half
a
laugh.
“He
does
not
know
yet,
does
he?
The
Usurper
owes
Drogo
a
lordship.”
This
time
her
laugh
was
half
a
sob.
She
hugged
herself
protectively.
“And
me,
you
said.
Only
me?”

“You
and
the
child,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
grim.

“No.
He
cannot
have
my
son.”
She
would
not
weep,
she
decided.
She
would
not
shiver
with
fear.
The
Usurper
has
woken
the
dragon
now,
she
told
herself…
and
her
eyes
went
to
the
dragon’s
eggs
resting
in
their
nest
of
dark
velvet.
The
shifting
lamplight
limned
their
stony
scales,
and
shimmering
motes
of
jade
and
scarlet
and
gold
swam
in
the
air
around
them,
like
courtiers
around
a
king.

Was
it
madness
that
seized
her
then,
born
of
fear?
Or
some
strange
wisdom
buried
in
her
blood?
Dany
could
not
have
said.
She
heard
her
own
voice
saying,
“Ser
Jorah,
light
the
brazier.”

“Khaleesi?”
The
knight
looked
at
her
strangely.
“It
is
so
hot.
Are
you
certain?”

She
had
never
been
so
certain.
“Yes.
I…
I
have
a
chill.
Light
the
brazier.”

He
bowed.
“As
you
command.”

When
the
coals
were
afire,
Dany
sent
Ser
Jorah
from
her.
She
had
to
be
alone
to
do
what
she
must
do.
This
is
madness,
she
told
herself
as
she
lifted
the
black-and-scarlet
egg
from
the
velvet.
It
will
only
crack
and
burn,
and
it’s
so
beautiful,
Ser
Jorah
will
call
me
a
fool
if
I
ruin
it,
and
yet,
and
yet…

Cradling
the
egg
with
both
hands,
she
carried
it
to
the
fire
and
pushed
it
down
amongst
the
burning
coals.
The
black
scales
seemed
to
glow
as
they
drank
the
heat.
Flames
licked
against
the
stone
with
small
red
tongues.
Dany
placed
the
other
two
eggs
beside
the
black
one
in
the
fire.
As
she
stepped
back
from
the
brazier,
the
breath
trembled
in
her
throat.

She
watched
until
the
coals
had
turned
to
ashes.
Drifting
sparks
floated
up
and
out
of
the
smokehole.
Heat
shimmered
in
waves
around
the
dragon’s
eggs.
And
that
was
all.

Your
brother
Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,
Ser
Jorah
had
said.
Dany
gazed
at
her
eggs
sadly.
What
had
she
expected?
A
thousand
thousand
years
ago
they
had
been
alive,
but
now
they
were
only
pretty
rocks.
They
could
not
make
a
dragon.
A
dragon
was
air
and
fire.
Living
flesh,
not
dead
stone.

The
brazier
was
cold
again
by
the
time
Khal
Drogo
returned.
Cohollo
was
leading
a
packhorse
behind
him,
with
the
carcass
of
a
great
white
lion
slung
across
its
back.
Above,
the
stars
were
coming
out.
The
khal
laughed
as
he
swung
down
off
his
stallion
and
showed
her
the
scars
on
his
leg
where
the
hrakkar
had
raked
him
through
his
leggings.
“I
shall
make
you
a
cloak
of
its
skin,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
swore.

When
Dany
told
him
what
had
happened
at
the
market,
all
laughter
stopped,
and
Khal
Drogo
grew
very
quiet.

“This
poisoner
was
the
first,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
warned
him,
“but
he
will
not
be
the
last.
Men
will
risk
much
for
a
lordship.”

Drogo
was
silent
for
a
time.
Finally
he
said,
“This
seller
of
poisons
ran
from
the
moon
of
my
life.
Better
he
should
run
after
her.
So
he
will.
Jhogo,
Jorah
the
Andal,
to
each
of
you
I
say,
choose
any
horse
you
wish
from
my
herds,
and
it
is
yours.
Any
horse
save
my
red
and
the
silver
that
was
my
bride
gift
to
the
moon
of
my
life.
I
make
this
gift
to
you
for
what
you
did.

“And
to
Rhaego
son
of
Drogo,
the
stallion
who
will
mount
the
world,
to
him
I
also
pledge
a
gift.
To
him
I
will
give
this
iron
chair
his
mother’s
father
sat
in.
I
will
give
him
Seven
Kingdoms.
I,
Drogo,
khal,
will
do
this
thing.”
His
voice
rose,
and
he
lifted
his
fist
to
the
sky.
“I
will
take
my
khalasar
west
to
where
the
world
ends,
and
ride
the
wooden
horses
across
the
black
salt
water
as
no
khal
has
done
before.
I
will
kill
the
men
in
the
iron
suits
and
tear
down
their
stone
houses.
I
will
rape
their
women,
take
their
children
as
slaves,
and
bring
their
broken
gods
back
to
Vaes
Dothrak
to
bow
down
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
This
I
vow,
I,
Drogo
son
of
Bharbo.
This
I
swear
before
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
as
the
stars
look
down
in
witness.”

His
khalasar
left
Vaes
Dothrak
two
days
later,
striking
south
and
west
across
the
plains.
Khal
Drogo
led
them
on
his
great
red
stallion,
with
Daenerys
beside
him
on
her
silver.
The
wineseller
hurried
behind
them,
naked,
on
foot,
chained
at
throat
and
wrists.
His
chains
were
fastened
to
the
halter
of
Dany’s
silver.
As
she
rode,
he
ran
after
her,
barefoot
and
stumbling.
No
harm
would
come
to
him…
so
long
as
he
kept
up.

SANSA

The
southern
sky
was
black
with
smoke.
It
rose
swirling
off
a
hundred
distant
fires,
its
sooty
fingers
smudging
out
the
stars.
Across
the
Blackwater
Rush,
a
line
of
flame
burned
nightly
from
horizon
to
horizon,
while
on
this
side
the
Imp
had
fired
the
whole
riverfront:
docks
and
warehouses,
homes
and
brothels,
everything
outside
the
city
walls.

Even
in
the
Red
Keep,
the
air
tasted
of
ashes.
When
Sansa
found
Ser
Dontos
in
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
he
asked
if
she’d
been
crying.
“It’s
only
from
the
smoke,”
she
lied.
“It
looks
as
though
half
the
kingswood
is
burning.”

“Lord
Stannis
wants
to
smoke
out
the
Imp’s
savages.”
Dontos
swayed
as
he
spoke,
one
hand
on
the
trunk
of
a
chestnut
tree.
A
wine
stain
discolored
the
red-and-yellow
motley
of
his
tunic.
“They
kill
his
scouts
and
raid
his
baggage
train.
And
the
wildlings
have
been
lighting
fires
too.
The
Imp
told
the
queen
that
Stannis
had
better
train
his
horses
to
eat
ash,
since
he
would
find
no
blade
of
grass.
I
heard
him
say
so.
I
hear
all
sorts
of
things
as
a
fool
that
I
never
heard
when
I
was
a
knight.
They
talk
as
though
I
am
not
there,
and”—he
leaned
close,
breathing
his
winey
breath
right
in
her
face—“the
Spider
pays
in
gold
for
any
little
trifle.
I
think
Moon
Boy
has
been
his
for
years.”

He
is
drunk
again.
My
poor
Florian
he
names
himself,
and
so
he
is.
But
he
is
all
I
have.
“Is
it
true
Lord
Stannis
burned
the
godswood
at
Storm’s
End?”

Dontos
nodded.
“He
made
a
great
pyre
of
the
trees
as
an
offering
to
his
new
god.
The
red
priestess
made
him
do
it.
They
say
she
rules
him
now,
body
and
soul.
He’s
vowed
to
burn
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
too,
if
he
takes
the
city.”

“Let
him.”
When
Sansa
had
first
beheld
the
Great
Sept
with
its
marble
walls
and
seven
crystal
towers,
she’d
thought
it
was
the
most
beautiful
building
in
the
world,
but
that
had
been
before
Joffrey
beheaded
her
father
on
its
steps.
“I
want
it
burned.”

“Hush,
child,
the
gods
will
hear
you.”

“Why
should
they?
They
never
hear
my
prayers.”

“Yes
they
do.
They
sent
me
to
you,
didn’t
they?”

Sansa
picked
at
the
bark
of
a
tree.
She
felt
light-headed,
almost
feverish.
“They
sent
you,
but
what
good
have
you
done?
You
promised
you
would
take
me
home,
but
I’m
still
here.”

Dontos
patted
her
arm.
“I’ve
spoken
to
a
certain
man
I
know,
a
good
friend
to
me…
and
you,
my
lady.
He
will
hire
a
swift
ship
to
take
us
to
safety,
when
the
time
is
right.”

“The
time
is
right
now,”
Sansa
insisted,
“before
the
fighting
starts.
They’ve
forgotten
about
me.
I
know
we
could
slip
away
if
we
tried.”

“Child,
child.”
Dontos
shook
his
head.
“Out
of
the
castle,
yes,
we
could
do
that,
but
the
city
gates
are
more
heavily
guarded
than
ever,
and
the
Imp
has
even
closed
off
the
river.”

It
was
true.
The
Blackwater
Rush
was
as
empty
as
Sansa
had
ever
seen
it.
All
the
ferries
had
been
withdrawn
to
the
north
bank,
and
the
trading
galleys
had
fled
or
been
seized
by
the
Imp
to
be
made
over
for
battle.
The
only
ships
to
be
seen
were
the
king’s
war
galleys.
They
rowed
endlessly
up
and
down,
staying
to
the
deep
water
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
exchanging
flights
of
arrows
with
Stannis’s
archers
on
the
south
shore.

Lord
Stannis
himself
was
still
on
the
march,
but
his
vanguard
had
appeared
two
nights
ago
during
the
black
of
the
moon.
King’s
Landing
had
woken
to
the
sight
of
their
tents
and
banners.
They
were
five
thousand,
Sansa
had
heard,
near
as
many
as
all
the
gold
cloaks
in
the
city.
They
flew
the
red
or
green
apples
of
House
Fossoway,
the
turtle
of
Estermont,
and
the
fox-and-flowers
of
Florent,
and
their
commander
was
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen,
a
famous
southron
knight
who
men
now
called
Guyard
the
Green.
His
standard
showed
a
crow
in
flight,
its
black
wings
spread
wide
against
a
storm-green
sky.
But
it
was
the
pale
yellow
banners
that
worried
the
city.
Long
ragged
tails
streamed
behind
them
like
flickering
flames,
and
in
place
of
a
lord’s
sigil
they
bore
the
device
of
a
god:
the
burning
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light.

“When
Stannis
comes,
he’ll
have
ten
times
as
many
men
as
Joffrey
does,
everyone
says
so.”

Dontos
squeezed
her
shoulder.
“The
size
of
his
host
does
not
matter,
sweetling,
so
long
as
they
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river.
Stannis
cannot
cross
without
ships.”

“He
has
ships.
More
than
Joffrey.”

“It’s
a
long
sail
from
Storm’s
End,
the
fleet
will
need
to
come
up
Massey’s
Hook
and
through
the
Gullet
and
across
Blackwater
Bay.
Perhaps
the
good
gods
will
send
a
storm
to
sweep
them
from
the
seas.”
Dontos
gave
a
hopeful
smile.
“It
is
not
easy
for
you,
I
know.
You
must
be
patient,
child.
When
my
friend
returns
to
the
city,
we
shall
have
our
ship.
Have
faith
in
your
Florian,
and
try
not
to
be
afraid.”

Sansa
dug
her
nails
into
her
hand.
She
could
feel
the
fear
in
her
tummy,
twisting
and
pinching,
worse
every
day.
Nightmares
of
the
day
Princess
Myrcella
had
sailed
still
troubled
her
sleep;
dark
suffocating
dreams
that
woke
her
in
the
black
of
night,
struggling
for
breath.
She
could
hear
the
people
screaming
at
her,
screaming
without
words,
like
animals.
They
had
hemmed
her
in
and
thrown
filth
at
her
and
tried
to
pull
her
off
her
horse,
and
would
have
done
worse
if
the
Hound
had
not
cut
his
way
to
her
side.
They
had
torn
the
High
Septon
to
pieces
and
smashed
in
Ser
Aron’s
head
with
a
rock.
Try
not
to
be
afraid!
he
said.

The
whole
city
was
afraid.
Sansa
could
see
it
from
the
castle
walls.
The
smallfolk
were
hiding
themselves
behind
closed
shutters
and
barred
doors
as
if
that
would
keep
them
safe.
The
last
time
King’s
Landing
had
fallen,
the
Lannisters
looted
and
raped
as
they
pleased
and
put
hundreds
to
the
sword,
even
though
the
city
had
opened
its
gates.
This
time
the
Imp
meant
to
fight,
and
a
city
that
fought
could
expect
no
mercy
at
all.

Dontos
was
prattling
on.
“If
I
were
still
a
knight,
I
should
have
to
put
on
armor
and
man
the
walls
with
the
rest.
I
ought
to
kiss
King
Joffrey’s
feet
and
thank
him
sweetly.”

“If
you
thanked
him
for
making
you
a
fool,
he’d
make
you
a
knight
again,”
Sansa
said
sharply.

Dontos
chuckled.
“My
Jonquil’s
a
clever
girl,
isn’t
she?”

“Joffrey
and
his
mother
say
I’m
stupid.”

“Let
them.
You’re
safer
that
way,
sweetling.
Queen
Cersei
and
the
Imp
and
Lord
Varys
and
their
like,
they
all
watch
each
other
keen
as
hawks,
and
pay
this
one
and
that
one
to
spy
out
what
the
others
are
doing,
but
no
one
ever
troubles
themselves
about
Lady
Tanda’s
daughter,
do
they?”
Dontos
covered
his
mouth
to
stifle
a
burp.
“Gods
preserve
you,
my
little
Jonquil.”
He
was
growing
weepy.
The
wine
did
that
to
him.
“Give
your
Florian
a
little
kiss
now.
A
kiss
for
luck.”
He
swayed
toward
her.

Sansa
dodged
the
wet
groping
lips,
kissed
him
lightly
on
an
unshaven
cheek,
and
bid
him
good
night.
It
took
all
her
strength
not
to
weep.
She
had
been
weeping
too
much
of
late.
It
was
unseemly,
she
knew,
but
she
could
not
seem
to
help
herself;
the
tears
would
come,
sometimes
over
a
trifle,
and
nothing
she
did
could
hold
them
back.

The
drawbridge
to
Maegor’s
Holdfast
was
unguarded.
The
Imp
had
moved
most
of
the
gold
cloaks
to
the
city
walls,
and
the
white
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
had
duties
more
important
than
dogging
her
heels.
Sansa
could
go
where
she
would
so
long
as
she
did
not
try
to
leave
the
castle,
but
there
was
nowhere
she
wanted
to
go.

She
crossed
over
the
dry
moat
with
its
cruel
iron
spikes
and
made
her
way
up
the
narrow
turnpike
stair,
but
when
she
reached
the
door
of
her
bedchamber
she
could
not
bear
to
enter.
The
very
walls
of
the
room
made
her
feel
trapped;
even
with
the
window
opened
wide
it
felt
as
though
there
were
no
air
to
breathe.

Turning
back
to
the
stair,
Sansa
climbed.
The
smoke
blotted
out
the
stars
and
the
thin
crescent
of
moon,
so
the
roof
was
dark
and
thick
with
shadows.
Yet
from
here
she
could
see
everything:
the
Red
Keep’s
tall
towers
and
great
cornerforts,
the
maze
of
city
streets
beyond,
to
south
and
west
the
river
running
black,
the
bay
to
the
east,
the
columns
of
smoke
and
cinders,
and
fires,
fires
everywhere.
Soldiers
crawled
over
the
city
walls
like
ants
with
torches,
and
crowded
the
hoardings
that
had
sprouted
from
the
ramparts.
Down
by
the
Mud
Gate,
outlined
against
the
drifting
smoke,
she
could
make
out
the
vague
shape
of
the
three
huge
catapults,
the
biggest
anyone
had
ever
seen,
overtopping
the
walls
by
a
good
twenty
feet.
Yet
none
of
it
made
her
feel
less
fearful.
A
stab
went
through
her,
so
sharp
that
Sansa
sobbed
and
clutched
at
her
belly.
She
might
have
fallen,
but
a
shadow
moved
suddenly,
and
strong
fingers
grabbed
her
arm
and
steadied
her.

She
grabbed
a
merlon
for
support,
her
fingers
scrabbling
at
the
rough
stone.
“Let
go
of
me,”
she
cried.
“Let
go.”

“The
little
bird
thinks
she
has
wings,
does
she?
Or
do
you
mean
to
end
up
crippled
like
that
brother
of
yours?”

Sansa
twisted
in
his
grasp.
“I
wasn’t
going
to
fall.
It
was
only…
you
startled
me,
that’s
all.”

“You
mean
I
scared
you.
And
still
do.”

She
took
a
deep
breath
to
calm
herself.
“I
thought
I
was
alone,
I…”
She
glanced
away.

“The
little
bird
still
can’t
bear
to
look
at
me,
can
she?”
The
Hound
released
her.
“You
were
glad
enough
to
see
my
face
when
the
mob
had
you,
though.
Remember?”

Sansa
remembered
all
too
well.
She
remembered
the
way
they
had
howled,
the
feel
of
the
blood
running
down
her
cheek
from
where
the
stone
had
struck
her,
and
the
garlic
stink
on
the
breath
of
the
man
who
had
tried
to
pull
her
from
her
horse.
She
could
still
feel
the
cruel
pinch
of
fingers
on
her
wrist
as
she
lost
her
balance
and
began
to
fall.

She’d
thought
she
was
going
to
die
then,
but
the
fingers
had
twitched,
all
five
at
once,
and
the
man
had
shrieked
loud
as
a
horse.
When
his
hand
fell
away,
another
hand,
stronger,
shoved
her
back
into
her
saddle.
The
man
with
the
garlicky
breath
was
on
the
ground,
blood
pumping
out
the
stump
of
his
arm,
but
there
were
others
all
around,
some
with
clubs
in
hand.
The
Hound
leapt
at
them,
his
sword
a
blur
of
steel
that
trailed
a
red
mist
as
it
swung.
When
they
broke
and
ran
before
him
he
had
laughed,
his
terrible
burned
face
for
a
moment
transformed.

She
made
herself
look
at
that
face
now,
really
look.
It
was
only
courteous,
and
a
lady
must
never
forget
her
courtesies.
The
scars
are
not
the
worst
part,
nor
even
the
way
his
mouth
twitches.
It’s
his
eyes.
She
had
never
seen
eyes
so
full
of
anger.
“I…
I
should
have
come
to
you
after,”
she
said
haltingly.
“To
thank
you,
for…
for
saving
me…
you
were
so
brave.”

“Brave?”
His
laugh
was
half
a
snarl.
“A
dog
doesn’t
need
courage
to
chase
off
rats.
They
had
me
thirty
to
one,
and
not
a
man
of
them
dared
face
me.”

She
hated
the
way
he
talked,
always
so
harsh
and
angry.
“Does
it
give
you
joy
to
scare
people?”

“No,
it
gives
me
joy
to
kill
people.”
His
mouth
twitched.
“Wrinkle
up
your
face
all
you
like,
but
spare
me
this
false
piety.
You
were
a
high
lord’s
get.
Don’t
tell
me
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell
never
killed
a
man.”

“That
was
his
duty.
He
never
liked
it.”

“Is
that
what
he
told
you?”
Clegane
laughed
again.
“Your
father
lied.
Killing
is
the
sweetest
thing
there
is.”
He
drew
his
longsword.
“Here’s
your
truth.
Your
precious
father
found
that
out
on
Baelor’s
steps.
Lord
of
Winterfell,
Hand
of
the
King,
Warden
of
the
North,
the
mighty
Eddard
Stark,
of
a
line
eight
thousand
years
old…
but
Ilyn
Payne’s
blade
went
through
his
neck
all
the
same,
didn’t
it?
Do
you
remember
the
dance
he
did
when
his
head
came
off
his
shoulders?”

Sansa
hugged
herself,
suddenly
cold.
“Why
are
you
always
so
hateful?
I
was
thanking
you…”

“Just
as
if
I
was
one
of
those
true
knights
you
love
so
well,
yes.
What
do
you
think
a
knight
is
for,
girl?
You
think
it’s
all
taking
favors
from
ladies
and
looking
fine
in
gold
plate?
Knights
are
for
killing.”
He
laid
the
edge
of
his
longsword
against
her
neck,
just
under
her
ear.
Sansa
could
feel
the
sharpness
of
the
steel.
“I
killed
my
first
man
at
twelve.
I’ve
lost
count
of
how
many
I’ve
killed
since
then.
High
lords
with
old
names,
fat
rich
men
dressed
in
velvet,
knights
puffed
up
like
bladders
with
their
honors,
yes,
and
women
and
children
too—they’re
all
meat,
and
I’m
the
butcher.
Let
them
have
their
lands
and
their
gods
and
their
gold.
Let
them
have
their
sers.”
Sandor
Clegane
spat
at
her
feet
to
show
what
he
thought
of
that.
“So
long
as
I
have
this,”
he
said,
lifting
the
sword
from
her
throat,
“there’s
no
man
on
earth
I
need
fear.”

Except
your
brother,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
had
better
sense
than
to
say
it
aloud.
He
is
a
dog,
just
as
he
says.
A
half-wild,
mean-tempered
dog
that
bites
any
hand
that
tries
to
pet
him,
and
yet
will
savage
any
man
who
tries
to
hurt
his
masters.
“Not
even
the
men
across
the
river?”

Clegane’s
eyes
turned
toward
the
distant
fires.
“All
this
burning.”
He
sheathed
his
sword.
“Only
cowards
fight
with
fire.”

“Lord
Stannis
is
no
coward.”

“He’s
not
the
man
his
brother
was
either.
Robert
never
let
a
little
thing
like
a
river
stop
him.”

“What
will
you
do
when
he
crosses?”

“Fight.
Kill.
Die,
maybe.”

“Aren’t
you
afraid?
The
gods
might
send
you
down
to
some
terrible
hell
for
all
the
evil
you’ve
done.”

“What
evil?”
He
laughed.
“What
gods?”

“The
gods
who
made
us
all.”

“All?”
he
mocked.
“Tell
me,
little
bird,
what
kind
of
god
makes
a
monster
like
the
Imp,
or
a
halfwit
like
Lady
Tanda’s
daughter?
If
there
are
gods,
they
made
sheep
so
wolves
could
eat
mutton,
and
they
made
the
weak
for
the
strong
to
play
with.”

“True
knights
protect
the
weak.”

He
snorted.
“There
are
no
true
knights,
no
more
than
there
are
gods.
If
you
can’t
protect
yourself,
die
and
get
out
of
the
way
of
those
who
can.
Sharp
steel
and
strong
arms
rule
this
world,
don’t
ever
believe
any
different.”

Sansa
backed
away
from
him.
“You’re
awful.”

“I’m
honest.
It’s
the
world
that’s
awful.
Now
fly
away,
little
bird,
I’m
sick
of
you
peeping
at
me.”

Wordless,
she
fled.
She
was
afraid
of
Sandor
Clegane…
and
yet,
some
part
of
her
wished
that
Ser
Dontos
had
a
little
of
the
Hound’s
ferocity.
There
are
gods,
she
told
herself,
and
there
are
true
knights
too.
All
the
stories
can’t
be
lies.

That
night
Sansa
dreamed
of
the
riot
again.
The
mob
surged
around
her,
shrieking,
a
maddened
beast
with
a
thousand
faces.
Everywhere
she
turned
she
saw
faces
twisted
into
monstrous
inhuman
masks.
She
wept
and
told
them
she
had
never
done
them
hurt,
yet
they
dragged
her
from
her
horse
all
the
same.
“No,”
she
cried,
“no,
please,
don’t,
don’t,”
but
no
one
paid
her
any
heed.
She
shouted
for
Ser
Dontos,
for
her
brothers,
for
her
dead
father
and
her
dead
wolf,
for
gallant
Ser
Loras
who
had
given
her
a
red
rose
once,
but
none
of
them
came.
She
called
for
the
heroes
from
the
songs,
for
Florian
and
Ser
Ryam
Redwyne
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
but
no
one
heard.
Women
swarmed
over
her
like
weasels,
pinching
her
legs
and
kicking
her
in
the
belly,
and
someone
hit
her
in
the
face
and
she
felt
her
teeth
shatter.
Then
she
saw
the
bright
glimmer
of
steel.
The
knife
plunged
into
her
belly
and
tore
and
tore
and
tore,
until
there
was
nothing
left
of
her
down
there
but
shiny
wet
ribbons.

When
she
woke,
the
pale
light
of
morning
was
slanting
through
her
window,
yet
she
felt
as
sick
and
achy
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at
all.
There
was
something
sticky
on
her
thighs.
When
she
threw
back
the
blanket
and
saw
the
blood,
all
she
could
think
was
that
her
dream
had
somehow
come
true.
She
remembered
the
knives
inside
her,
twisting
and
ripping.
She
squirmed
away
in
horror,
kicking
at
the
sheets
and
falling
to
the
floor,
breathing
raggedly,
naked,
bloodied,
and
afraid.

But
as
she
crouched
there,
on
her
hands
and
knees,
understanding
came.
“No,
please,”
Sansa
whimpered,
“please,
no.”
She
didn’t
want
this
happening
to
her,
not
now,
not
here,
not
now,
not
now,
not
now,
not
now.

Madness
took
hold
of
her.
Pulling
herself
up
by
the
bedpost,
she
went
to
the
basin
and
washed
between
her
legs,
scrubbing
away
all
the
stickiness.
By
the
time
she
was
done,
the
water
was
pink
with
blood.
When
her
maidservants
saw
it
they
would
know.
Then
she
remembered
the
bedclothes.
She
rushed
back
to
the
bed
and
stared
in
horror
at
the
dark
red
stain
and
the
tale
it
told.
All
she
could
think
was
that
she
had
to
get
rid
of
it,
or
else
they’d
see.
She
couldn’t
let
them
see,
or
they’d
marry
her
to
Joffrey
and
make
her
lay
with
him.

Snatching
up
her
knife,
Sana
hacked
at
the
sheet,
cutting
out
the
stain.
If
they
ask
me
about
the
hole,
what
will
I
say?
Tears
ran
down
her
face.
She
pulled
the
torn
sheet
from
the
bed,
and
the
stained
blanket
as
well.
I’ll
have
to
burn
them.
She
balled
up
the
evidence,
stuffed
it
in
the
fireplace,
drenched
it
in
oil
from
her
bedside
lamp,
and
lit
it
afire.
Then
she
realized
that
the
blood
had
soaked
through
the
sheet
into
the
featherbed,
so
she
bundled
that
up
as
well,
but
it
was
big
and
cumbersome,
hard
to
move.
Sansa
could
get
only
half
of
it
into
the
fire.
She
was
on
her
knees,
struggling
to
shove
the
mattress
into
the
flames
as
thick
grey
smoke
eddied
around
her
and
filled
the
room,
when
the
door
burst
open
and
she
heard
her
maid
gasp.

In
the
end
it
took
three
of
them
to
pull
her
away.
And
it
was
all
for
nothing.
The
bedclothes
were
burnt,
but
by
the
time
they
carried
her
off
her
thighs
were
bloody
again.
It
was
as
if
her
own
body
had
betrayed
her
to
Joffrey,
unfurling
a
banner
of
Lannister
crimson
for
all
the
world
to
see.

When
the
fire
was
out,
they
carried
off
the
singed
featherbed,
fanned
away
the
worst
of
the
smoke,
and
brought
up
a
tub.
Women
came
and
went,
muttering
and
looking
at
her
strangely.
They
filled
the
tub
with
scalding
hot
water,
bathed
her
and
washed
her
hair
and
gave
her
a
cloth
to
wear
between
her
legs.
By
then
Sansa
was
calm
again,
and
ashamed
for
her
folly.
The
smoke
had
ruined
most
of
her
clothing.
One
of
the
women
went
away
and
came
back
with
a
green
wool
shift
that
was
almost
her
size.
“It’s
not
as
pretty
as
your
own
things,
but
it
will
serve,”
she
announced
when
she’d
pulled
it
down
over
Sansa’s
head.
“Your
shoes
weren’t
burned,
so
at
least
you
won’t
need
to
go
barefoot
to
the
queen.”

Cersei
Lannister
was
breaking
her
fast
when
Sansa
was
ushered
into
her
solar.
“You
may
sit,”
the
queen
said
graciously.
“Are
you
hungry?”
She
gestured
at
the
table.
There
was
porridge,
honey,
milk,
boiled
eggs,
and
crisp
fried
fish.

The
sight
of
the
food
made
Sansa
feel
ill.
Her
tummy
was
tied
in
a
knot.
“No,
thank
you,
Your
Grace.”

“I
don’t
blame
you.
Between
Tyrion
and
Lord
Stannis,
everything
I
eat
tastes
of
ash.
And
now
you’re
setting
fires
as
well.
What
did
you
hope
to
accomplish?”

Sansa
lowered
her
head.
“The
blood
frightened
me.”

“The
blood
is
the
seal
of
your
womanhood.
Lady
Catelyn
might
have
prepared
you.
You’ve
had
your
first
flowering,
no
more.”

Sansa
had
never
felt
less
flowery.
“My
lady
mother
told
me,
but
I…
I
thought
it
would
be
different.”

“Different
how?”

“I
don’t
know.
Less…
less
messy,
and
more
magical.”

Queen
Cersei
laughed.
“Wait
until
you
birth
a
child,
Sansa.
A
woman’s
life
is
nine
parts
mess
to
one
part
magic,
you’ll
learn
that
soon
enough…
and
the
parts
that
look
like
magic
often
turn
out
to
be
messiest
of
all.”
She
took
a
sip
of
milk.
“So
now
you
are
a
woman.
Do
you
have
the
least
idea
of
what
that
means?”

“It
means
that
I
am
now
fit
to
be
wedded
and
bedded,”
said
Sansa,
“and
to
bear
children
for
the
king.”

The
queen
gave
a
wry
smile.
“A
prospect
that
no
longer
entices
you
as
it
once
did,
I
can
see.
I
will
not
fault
you
for
that.
Joffrey
has
always
been
difficult.
Even
his
birth…
I
labored
a
day
and
a
half
to
bring
him
forth.
You
cannot
imagine
the
pain,
Sansa.
I
screamed
so
loudly
that
I
fancied
Robert
might
hear
me
in
the
kingswood.”

“His
Grace
was
not
with
you?”

“Robert?
Robert
was
hunting.
That
was
his
custom.
Whenever
my
time
was
near,
my
royal
husband
would
flee
to
the
trees
with
his
huntsmen
and
hounds.
When
he
returned
he
would
present
me
with
some
pelts
or
a
stag’s
head,
and
I
would
present
him
with
a
baby.

“Not
that
I
wanted
him
to
stay,
mind
you.
I
had
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
and
an
army
of
midwives,
and
I
had
my
brother.
When
they
told
Jaime
he
was
not
allowed
in
the
birthing
room,
he
smiled
and
asked
which
of
them
proposed
to
keep
him
out.

“Joffrey
will
show
you
no
such
devotion,
I
fear.
You
could
thank
your
sister
for
that,
if
she
weren’t
dead.
He’s
never
been
able
to
forget
that
day
on
the
Trident
when
you
saw
her
shame
him,
so
he
shames
you
in
turn.
You’re
stronger
than
you
seem,
though.
I
expect
you’ll
survive
a
bit
of
humiliation.
I
did.
You
may
never
love
the
king,
but
you’ll
love
his
children.”

“I
love
His
Grace
with
all
my
heart,”
Sansa
said.

The
queen
sighed.
“You
had
best
learn
some
new
lies,
and
quickly.
Lord
Stannis
will
not
like
that
one,
I
promise
you.”

“The
new
High
Septon
said
that
the
gods
will
never
permit
Lord
Stannis
to
win,
since
Joffrey
is
the
rightful
king.”

A
half
smile
flickered
across
the
queen’s
face.
“Robert’s
trueborn
son
and
heir.
Though
Joff
would
cry
whenever
Robert
picked
him
up.
His
Grace
did
not
like
that.
His
bastards
had
always
gurgled
at
him
happily,
and
sucked
his
finger
when
he
put
it
in
their
little
baseborn
mouths.
Robert
wanted
smiles
and
cheers,
always,
so
he
went
where
he
found
them,
to
his
friends
and
his
whores.
Robert
wanted
to
be
loved.
My
brother
Tyrion
has
the
same
disease.
Do
you
want
to
be
loved,
Sansa?”

“Everyone
wants
to
be
loved.”

“I
see
flowering
hasn’t
made
you
any
brighter,”
said
Cersei.
“Sansa,
permit
me
to
share
a
bit
of
womanly
wisdom
with
you
on
this
very
special
day.
Love
is
poison.
A
sweet
poison,
yes,
but
it
will
kill
you
all
the
same.”
=======
CATELYN

It
was
too
far
to
make
out
the
banners
clearly,
but
even
through
the
drifting
fog
she
could
see
that
they
were
white,
with
a
dark
smudge
in
their
center
that
could
only
be
the
direwolf
of
Stark,
grey
upon
its
icy
field.
When
she
saw
it
with
her
own
eyes,
Catelyn
reined
up
her
horse
and
bowed
her
head
in
thanks.
The
gods
were
good.
She
was
not
too
late.

“They
await
our
coming,
my
lady,”
Ser
Wylis
Manderly
said,
“as
my
lord
father
swore
they
would.”

“Let
us
not
keep
them
waiting
any
longer,
ser.”
Ser
Brynden
Tully
put
the
spurs
to
his
horse
and
trotted
briskly
toward
the
banners.
Catelyn
rode
beside
him.

Ser
Wylis
and
his
brother
Ser
Wendel
followed,
leading
their
levies,
near
fifteen
hundred
men:
some
twenty-odd
knights
and
as
many
squires,
two
hundred
mounted
lances,
swordsmen,
and
freeriders,
and
the
rest
foot,
armed
with
spears,
pikes
and
tridents.
Lord
Wyman
had
remained
behind
to
see
to
the
defenses
of
White
Harbor.
A
man
of
near
sixty
years,
he
had
grown
too
stout
to
sit
a
horse.
“If
I
had
thought
to
see
war
again
in
my
lifetime,
I
should
have
eaten
a
few
less
eels,”
he’d
told
Catelyn
when
he
met
her
ship,
slapping
his
massive
belly
with
both
hands.
His
fingers
were
fat
as
sausages.
“My
boys
will
see
you
safe
to
your
son,
though,
have
no
fear.”

His
“boys”
were
both
older
than
Catelyn,
and
she
might
have
wished
that
they
did
not
take
after
their
father
quite
so
closely.
Ser
Wylis
was
only
a
few
eels
short
of
not
being
able
to
mount
his
own
horse;
she
pitied
the
poor
animal.
Ser
Wendel,
the
younger
boy,
would
have
been
the
fattest
man
she’d
ever
known,
had
she
only
neglected
to
meet
his
father
and
brother.
Wylis
was
quiet
and
formal,
Wendel
loud
and
boisterous;
both
had
ostentatious
walrus
mustaches
and
heads
as
bare
as
a
baby’s
bottom;
neither
seemed
to
own
a
single
garment
that
was
not
spotted
with
food
stains.
Yet
she
liked
them
well
enough;
they
had
gotten
her
to
Robb,
as
their
father
had
vowed,
and
nothing
else
mattered.

She
was
pleased
to
see
that
her
son
had
sent
eyes
out,
even
to
the
east.
The
Lannisters
would
come
from
the
south
when
they
came,
but
it
was
good
that
Robb
was
being
careful.
My
son
is
leading
a
host
to
war,
she
thought,
still
only
half
believing
it.
She
was
desperately
afraid
for
him,
and
for
Winterfell,
yet
she
could
not
deny
feeling
a
certain
pride
as
well.
A
year
ago
he
had
been
a
boy.
What
was
he
now?
she
wondered.

Outriders
spied
the
Manderly
banners—the
white
merman
with
trident
in
hand,
rising
from
a
blue-green
sea—and
hailed
them
warmly.
They
were
led
to
a
spot
of
high
ground
dry
enough
for
a
camp.
Ser
Wylis
called
a
halt
there,
and
remained
behind
with
his
men
to
see
the
fires
laid
and
the
horses
tended,
while
his
brother
Wendel
rode
on
with
Catelyn
and
her
uncle
to
present
their
father’s
respects
to
their
liege
lord.

The
ground
under
their
horses’
hooves
was
soft
and
wet.
It
fell
away
slowly
beneath
them
as
they
rode
past
smoky
peat
fires,
lines
of
horses,
and
wagons
heavy-laden
with
hardbread
and
salt
beef.
On
a
stony
outcrop
of
land
higher
than
the
surrounding
country,
they
passed
a
lord’s
pavilion
with
walls
of
heavy
sailcloth.
Catelyn
recognized
the
banner,
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods,
brown
on
its
dark
orange
field.

Just
beyond,
through
the
mists,
she
glimpsed
the
walls
and
towers
of
Moat
Cailin…
or
what
remained
of
them.
Immense
blocks
of
black
basalt,
each
as
large
as
a
crofter’s
cottage,
lay
scattered
and
tumbled
like
a
child’s
wooden
blocks,
half-sunk
in
the
soft
boggy
soil.
Nothing
else
remained
of
a
curtain
wall
that
had
once
stood
as
high
as
Winterfell’s.
The
wooden
keep
was
gone
entirely,
rotted
away
a
thousand
years
past,
with
not
so
much
as
a
timber
to
mark
where
it
had
stood.
All
that
was
left
of
the
great
stronghold
of
the
First
Men
were
three
towers…
three
where
there
had
once
been
twenty,
if
the
taletellers
could
be
believed.

The
Gatehouse
Tower
looked
sound
enough,
and
even
boasted
a
few
feet
of
standing
wall
to
either
side
of
it.
The
Drunkard’s
Tower,
off
in
the
bog
where
the
south
and
west
walls
had
once
met,
leaned
like
a
man
about
to
spew
a
bellyful
of
wine
into
the
gutter.
And
the
tall,
slender
Children’s
Tower,
where
legend
said
the
children
of
the
forest
had
once
called
upon
their
nameless
gods
to
send
the
hammer
of
the
waters,
had
lost
half
its
crown.
It
looked
as
if
some
great
beast
had
taken
a
bite
out
of
the
crenellations
along
the
tower
top,
and
spit
the
rubble
across
the
bog.
All
three
towers
were
green
with
moss.
A
tree
was
growing
out
between
the
stones
on
the
north
side
of
the
Gatehouse
Tower,
its
gnarled
limbs
festooned
with
ropy
white
blankets
of
ghostskin.

“Gods
have
mercy,”
Ser
Brynden
exclaimed
when
he
saw
what
lay
before
them.
“This
is
Moat
Cailin?
It’s
no
more
than
a—”

“—death
trap,”
Catelyn
finished.
“I
know
how
it
looks,
Uncle.
I
thought
the
same
the
first
time
I
saw
it,
but
Ned
assured
me
that
this
ruin
is
more
formidable
than
it
seems.
The
three
surviving
towers
command
the
causeway
from
all
sides,
and
any
enemy
must
pass
between
them.
The
bogs
here
are
impenetrable,
full
of
quicksands
and
suckholes
and
teeming
with
snakes.
To
assault
any
of
the
towers,
an
army
would
need
to
wade
through
waist-deep
black
muck,
cross
a
moat
full
of
lizard-lions,
and
scale
walls
slimy
with
moss,
all
the
while
exposing
themselves
to
fire
from
archers
in
the
other
towers.”
She
gave
her
uncle
a
grim
smile.
“And
when
night
falls,
there
are
said
to
be
ghosts,
cold
vengeful
spirits
of
the
north
who
hunger
for
southron
blood.”

Ser
Brynden
chuckled.
“Remind
me
not
to
linger
here.
Last
I
looked,
I
was
southron
myself.”

Standards
had
been
raised
atop
all
three
towers.
The
Karstark
sunburst
hung
from
the
Drunkard’s
Tower,
beneath
the
direwolf;
on
the
Children’s
Tower
it
was
the
Greatjon’s
giant
in
shattered
chains.
But
on
the
Gatehouse
Tower,
the
Stark
banner
flew
alone.
That
was
where
Robb
had
made
his
seat.
Catelyn
made
for
it,
with
Ser
Brynden
and
Ser
Wendel
behind
her,
their
horses
stepping
slowly
down
the
log-and-plank
road
that
had
been
laid
across
the
green-and-black
fields
of
mud.

She
found
her
son
surrounded
by
his
father’s
lords
bannermen,
in
a
drafty
hall
with
a
peat
fire
smoking
in
a
black
hearth.
He
was
seated
at
a
massive
stone
table,
a
pile
of
maps
and
papers
in
front
of
him,
talking
intently
with
Roose
Bolton
and
the
Greatjon.
At
first
he
did
not
notice
her…
but
his
wolf
did.
The
great
grey
beast
was
lying
near
the
fire,
but
when
Catelyn
entered
he
lifted
his
head,
and
his
golden
eyes
met
hers.
The
lords
fell
silent
one
by
one,
and
Robb
looked
up
at
the
sudden
quiet
and
saw
her.
“Mother?”
he
said,
his
voice
thick
with
emotion.

Catelyn
wanted
to
run
to
him,
to
kiss
his
sweet
brow,
to
wrap
him
in
her
arms
and
hold
him
so
tightly
that
he
would
never
come
to
harm…
but
here
in
front
of
his
lords,
she
dared
not.
He
was
playing
a
man’s
part
now,
and
she
would
not
take
that
away
from
him.
So
she
held
herself
at
the
far
end
of
the
basalt
slab
they
were
using
for
a
table.
The
direwolf
got
to
his
feet
and
padded
across
the
room
to
where
she
stood.
It
seemed
bigger
than
a
wolf
ought
to
be.
“You’ve
grown
a
beard,”
she
said
to
Robb,
while
Grey
Wind
sniffed
her
hand.

He
rubbed
his
stubbled
jaw,
suddenly
awkward.
“Yes.”
His
chin
hairs
were
redder
than
the
ones
on
his
head.

“I
like
it.”
Catelyn
stroked
the
wolfs
head,
gently.
“It
makes
you
look
like
my
brother
Edmure.”
Grey
Wind
nipped
at
her
fingers,
playful,
and
trotted
back
to
his
place
by
the
fire.

Ser
Helman
Tallhart
was
the
first
to
follow
the
direwolf
across
the
room
to
pay
his
respects,
kneeling
before
her
and
pressing
his
brow
to
her
hand.
“Lady
Catelyn,”
he
said,
“you
are
fair
as
ever,
a
welcome
sight
in
troubled
times.”
The
Glovers
followed,
Galbart
and
Robett,
and
Greatjon
Umber,
and
the
rest,
one
by
one.
Theon
Greyjoy
was
the
last.
“I
had
not
looked
to
see
you
here,
my
lady,”
he
said
as
he
knelt.

“I
had
not
thought
to
be
here,”
Catelyn
said,
“until
I
came
ashore
at
White
Harbor,
and
Lord
Wyman
told
me
that
Robb
had
called
the
banners.
You
know
his
son,
Ser
Wendel.”
Wendel
Manderly
stepped
forward
and
bowed
as
low
as
his
girth
would
allow.
“And
my
uncle,
Ser
Brynden
Tully,
who
has
left
my
sister’s
service
for
mine.”

“The
Blackfish,”
Robb
said.
“Thank
you
for
joining
us,
ser.
We
need
men
of
your
courage.
And
you,
Ser
Wendel,
I
am
glad
to
have
you
here.
Is
Ser
Rodrik
with
you
as
well,
Mother?
I’ve
missed
him.”

“Ser
Rodrik
is
on
his
way
north
from
White
Harbor.
I
have
named
him
castellan
and
commanded
him
to
hold
Winterfell
till
our
return.
Maester
Luwin
is
a
wise
counsellor,
but
unskilled
in
the
arts
of
war.”

“Have
no
fear
on
that
count,
Lady
Stark,”
the
Greatjon
told
her
in
his
bass
rumble.
“Winterfell
is
safe.
We’ll
shove
our
swords
up
Tywin
Lannister’s
bunghole
soon
enough,
begging
your
pardons,
and
then
it’s
on
to
the
Red
Keep
to
free
Ned.”

“My
lady,
a
question,
as
it
please
you.”
Roose
Bolton,
Lord
of
the
Dreadfort,
had
a
small
voice,
yet
when
he
spoke
larger
men
quieted
to
listen.
His
eyes
were
curiously
pale,
almost
without
color,
and
his
look
disturbing.
“It
is
said
that
you
hold
Lord
Tywin’s
dwarf
son
as
captive.
Have
you
brought
him
to
us?
I
vow,
we
should
make
good
use
of
such
a
hostage.”

“I
did
hold
Tyrion
Lannister,
but
no
longer,”
Catelyn
was
forced
to
admit.
A
chorus
of
consternation
greeted
the
news.
“I
was
no
more
pleased
than
you,
my
lords.
The
gods
saw
fit
to
free
him,
with
some
help
from
my
fool
of
a
sister.”
She
ought
not
to
be
so
open
in
her
contempt,
she
knew,
but
her
parting
from
the
Eyrie
had
not
been
pleasant.
She
had
offered
to
take
Lord
Robert
with
her,
to
foster
him
at
Winterfell
for
a
few
years.
The
company
of
other
boys
would
do
him
good,
she
had
dared
to
suggest.
Lysa’s
rage
had
been
frightening
to
behold.
“Sister
or
no,”
she
had
replied,
“if
you
try
to
steal
my
son,
you
will
leave
by
the
Moon
Door.”
After
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said.

The
lords
were
anxious
to
question
her
further,
but
Catelyn
raised
a
hand.
“No
doubt
we
will
have
time
for
all
this
later,
but
my
journey
has
fatigued
me.
I
would
speak
with
my
son
alone.
I
know
you
will
forgive
me,
my
lords.”
She
gave
them
no
choice;
led
by
the
ever-obliging
Lord
Hornwood,
the
bannermen
bowed
and
took
their
leave.
“And
you,
Theon,”
she
added
when
Greyjoy
lingered.
He
smiled
and
left
them.

There
was
ale
and
cheese
on
the
table.
Catelyn
tilled
a
horn,
sat,
sipped,
and
studied
her
son.
He
seemed
taller
than
when
she’d
left,
and
the
wisps
of
beard
did
make
him
look
older.
“Edmure
was
sixteen
when
he
grew
his
first
whiskers.”

“I
will
be
sixteen
soon
enough,”
Robb
said.

“And
you
are
fifteen
now.
Fifteen,
and
leading
a
host
to
battle.
Can
you
understand
why
I
might
fear,
Robb?”

His
look
grew
stubborn.
“There
was
no
one
else.”

“No
one?”
she
said.
“Pray,
who
were
those
men
I
saw
here
a
moment
ago?
Roose
Bolton,
Rickard
Karstark,
Galbart
and
Robett
Glover,
the
Greatjon,
Helman
Tallhart…
you
might
have
given
the
command
to
any
of
them.
Gods
be
good,
you
might
even
have
sent
Theon,
though
he
would
not
be
my
choice.”

“They
are
not
Starks,”
he
said.

“They
are
men,
Robb,
seasoned
in
battle.
You
were
fighting
with
wooden
swords
less
than
a
year
past.”

She
saw
anger
in
his
eyes
at
that,
but
it
was
gone
as
quick
as
it
came,
and
suddenly
he
was
a
boy
again.
“I
know,”
he
said,
abashed.
“Are
you…
are
you
sending
me
back
to
Winterfell?”

Catelyn
sighed.
“I
should.
You
ought
never
have
left.
Yet
I
dare
not,
not
now.
You
have
come
too
far.
Someday
these
lords
will
look
to
you
as
their
liege.
If
I
pack
you
off
now,
like
a
child
being
sent
to
bed
without
his
supper,
they
will
remember,
and
laugh
about
it
in
their
cups.
The
day
will
come
when
you
need
them
to
respect
you,
even
fear
you
a
little.
Laughter
is
poison
to
fear.
I
will
not
do
that
to
you,
much
as
I
might
wish
to
keep
you
safe.”

“You
have
my
thanks,
Mother,”
he
said,
his
relief
obvious
beneath
the
formality.

She
reached
across
his
table
and
touched
his
hair.
“You
are
my
firstborn,
Robb.
I
have
only
to
look
at
you
to
remember
the
day
you
came
into
the
world,
red-faced
and
squalling.”

He
rose,
clearly
uncomfortable
with
her
touch,
and
walked
to
the
hearth.
Grey
Wind
rubbed
his
head
against
his
leg.
“You
know…
about
Father?”

“Yes.”
The
reports
of
Robert’s
sudden
death
and
Ned’s
fall
had
frightened
Catelyn
more
than
she
could
say,
but
she
would
not
let
her
son
see
her
fear.
“Lord
Manderly
told
me
when
I
landed
at
White
Harbor.
Have
you
had
any
word
of
your
sisters?”

“There
was
a
letter,”
Robb
said,
scratching
his
direwolf
under
the
jaw.
“One
for
you
as
well,
but
it
came
to
Winterfell
with
mine.”
He
went
to
the
table,
rummaged
among
some
maps
and
papers,
and
returned
with
a
crumpled
parchment.
“This
is
the
one
she
wrote
me,
I
never
thought
to
bring
yours.”

Something
in
Robb’s
tone
troubled
her.
She
smoothed
out
the
paper
and
read.
Concern
gave
way
to
disbelief,
then
to
anger,
and
lastly
to
fear.
“This
is
Cersei’s
letter,
not
your
sister’s,”
she
said
when
she
was
done.
“The
real
message
is
in
what
Sansa
does
not
say.
All
this
about
how
kindly
and
gently
the
Lannisters
are
treating
her…
I
know
the
sound
of
a
threat,
even
whispered.
They
have
Sansa
hostage,
and
they
mean
to
keep
her.”

“There’s
no
mention
of
Arya,”
Robb
pointed
out,
miserable.

“No.”
Catelyn
did
not
want
to
think
what
that
might
mean,
not
now,
not
here.

“I
had
hoped…
if
you
still
held
the
Imp,
a
trade
of
hostages…”
He
took
Sansa’s
letter
and
crumpled
it
in
his
fist,
and
she
could
tell
from
the
way
he
did
it
that
it
was
not
the
first
time.
“Is
there
word
from
the
Eyrie?
I
wrote
to
Aunt
Lysa,
asking
help.
Has
she
called
Lord
Arryn’s
banners,
do
you
know?
Will
the
knights
of
the
Vale
come
join
us?”

“Only
one,”
she
said,
“the
best
of
them,
my
uncle…
but
Brynden
Blackfish
was
a
Tully
first.
My
sister
is
not
about
to
stir
beyond
her
Bloody
Gate.”

Robb
took
it
hard.
“Mother,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
I
brought
this
whole
army
together,
eighteen
thousand
men,
but
I
don’t…
I’m
not
certain…”
He
looked
to
her,
his
eyes
shining,
the
proud
young
lord
melted
away
in
an
instant,
and
quick
as
that
he
was
a
child
again,
a
fifteen-year-old
boy
looking
to
his
mother
for
answers.

It
would
not
do.

“What
are
you
so
afraid
of,
Robb?”
she
asked
gently.

“I…”
He
turned
his
head
away,
to
hide
the
first
tear.
“If
we
march…
even
if
we
win…
the
Lannisters
hold
Sansa,
and
Father.
They’ll
kill
them,
won’t
they?”

“They
want
us
to
think
so.”

“You
mean
they’re
lying?”

“I
do
not
know,
Robb.
What
I
do
know
is
that
you
have
no
choice.
If
you
go
to
King’s
Landing
and
swear
fealty,
you
will
never
be
allowed
to
leave.
If
you
turn
your
tail
and
retreat
to
Winterfell,
your
lords
will
lose
all
respect
for
you.
Some
may
even
go
over
to
the
Lannisters.
Then
the
queen,
with
that
much
less
to
fear,
can
do
as
she
likes
with
her
prisoners.
Our
best
hope,
our
only
true
hope,
is
that
you
can
defeat
the
foe
in
the
field.
If
you
should
chance
to
take
Lord
Tywin
or
the
Kingslayer
captive,
why
then
a
trade
might
very
well
be
possible,
but
that
is
not
the
heart
of
it.
So
long
as
you
have
power
enough
that
they
must
fear
you,
Ned
and
your
sister
should
be
safe.
Cersei
is
wise
enough
to
know
that
she
may
need
them
to
make
her
peace,
should
the
fighting
go
against
her.”

“What
if
the
fighting
doesn’t
go
against
her?”
Robb
asked.
“What
if
it
goes
against
us?”

Catelyn
took
his
hand.
“Robb,
I
will
not
soften
the
truth
for
you.
If
you
lose,
there
is
no
hope
for
any
of
us.
They
say
there
is
naught
but
stone
at
the
heart
of
Casterly
Rock.
Remember
the
fate
of
Rhaegar’s
children.”

She
saw
the
fear
in
his
young
eyes
then,
but
there
was
a
strength
as
well.
“Then
I
will
not
lose,”
he
vowed.

“Tell
me
what
you
know
of
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands,”
she
said.
She
had
to
learn
if
he
was
truly
ready.

“Less
than
a
fortnight
past,
they
fought
a
battle
in
the
hills
below
the
Golden
Tooth,”
Robb
said.
“Uncle
Edmure
had
sent
Lord
Vance
and
Lord
Piper
to
hold
the
pass,
but
the
Kingslayer
descended
on
them
and
put
them
to
flight.
Lord
Vance
was
slain.
The
last
word
we
had
was
that
Lord
Piper
was
falling
back
to
join
your
brother
and
his
other
bannermen
at
Riverrun,
with
Jaime
Lannister
on
his
heels.
That’s
not
the
worst
of
it,
though.
All
the
time
they
were
battling
in
the
pass,
Lord
Tywin
was
bringing
a
second
Lannister
army
around
from
the
south.
It’s
said
to
be
even
larger
than
Jaime’s
host.

“Father
must
have
known
that,
because
he
sent
out
some
men
to
oppose
them,
under
the
king’s
own
banner.
He
gave
the
command
to
some
southron
lordling,
Lord
Erik
or
Derik
or
something
like
that,
but
Ser
Raymun
Darry
rode
with
him,
and
the
letter
said
there
were
other
knights
as
well,
and
a
force
of
Father’s
own
guardsmen.
Only
it
was
a
trap.
Lord
Derik
had
no
sooner
crossed
the
Red
Fork
than
the
Lannisters
fell
upon
him,
the
king’s
banner
be
damned,
and
Gregor
Clegane
took
them
in
the
rear
as
they
tried
to
pull
back
across
the
Mummer’s
Ford.
This
Lord
Derik
and
a
few
others
may
have
escaped,
no
one
is
certain,
but
Ser
Raymun
was
killed,
and
most
of
our
men
from
Winterfell.
Lord
Tywin
has
closed
off
the
kingsroad,
it’s
said,
and
now
he’s
marching
north
toward
Harrenhal,
burning
as
he
goes.”

Grim
and
grimmer,
thought
Catelyn.
It
was
worse
than
she’d
imagined.
“You
mean
to
meet
him
here?”
she
asked.

“If
he
comes
so
far,
but
no
one
thinks
he
will,”
Robb
said.
“I’ve
sent
word
to
Howland
Reed,
Father’s
old
friend
at
Greywater
Watch.
If
the
Lannisters
come
up
the
Neck,
the
crannogmen
will
bleed
them
every
step
of
the
way,
but
Galbart
Glover
says
Lord
Tywin
is
too
smart
for
that,
and
Roose
Bolton
agrees.
He’ll
stay
close
to
the
Trident,
they
believe,
taking
the
castles
of
the
river
lords
one
by
one,
until
Riverrun
stands
alone.
We
need
to
march
south
to
meet
him.”

The
very
idea
of
it
chilled
Catelyn
to
the
bone.
What
chance
would
a
fifteen-year-old
boy
have
against
seasoned
battle
commanders
like
Jaime
and
Tywin
Lannister?
“Is
that
wise?
You
are
strongly
placed
here.
It’s
said
that
the
old
Kings
in
the
North
could
stand
at
Moat
Cailin
and
throw
back
hosts
ten
times
the
size
of
their
own.”

“Yes,
but
our
food
and
supplies
are
running
low,
and
this
is
not
land
we
can
live
off
easily.
We’ve
been
waiting
for
Lord
Manderly,
but
now
that
his
sons
have
joined
us,
we
need
to
march.”

She
was
hearing
the
lords
bannermen
speaking
with
her
son’s
voice,
she
realized.
Over
the
years,
she
had
hosted
many
of
them
at
Winterfell,
and
been
welcomed
with
Ned
to
their
own
hearths
and
tables.
She
knew
what
sorts
of
men
they
were,
each
one.
She
wondered
if
Robb
did.

And
yet
there
was
sense
in
what
they
said.
This
host
her
son
had
assembled
was
not
a
standing
army
such
as
the
Free
Cities
were
accustomed
to
maintain,
nor
a
force
of
guardsmen
paid
in
coin.
Most
of
them
were
smallfolk:
crofters,
fieldhands,
fishermen,
sheepherders,
the
sons
of
innkeeps
and
traders
and
tanners,
leavened
with
a
smattering
of
sellswords
and
freeriders
hungry
for
plunder.
When
their
lords
called,
they
came…
but
not
forever.
“Marching
is
all
very
well,”
she
said
to
her
son,
“but
where,
and
to
what
purpose?
What
do
you
mean
to
do?”

Robb
hesitated.
“The
Greatjon
thinks
we
should
take
the
battle
to
Lord
Tywin
and
surprise
him,”
he
said,
“but
the
Glovers
and
the
Karstarks
feel
we’d
be
wiser
to
go
around
his
army
and
join
up
with
Uncle
Ser
Edmure
against
the
Kingslayer.”
He
ran
his
fingers
through
his
shaggy
mane
of
auburn
hair,
looking
unhappy.
“Though
by
the
time
we
reach
Riverrun…
I’m
not
certain…”

“Be
certain,”
Catelyn
told
her
son,
“or
go
home
and
take
up
that
wooden
sword
again.
You
cannot
afford
to
seem
indecisive
in
front
of
men
like
Roose
Bolton
and
Rickard
Karstark.
Make
no
mistake,
Robb—these
are
your
bannermen,
not
your
friends.
You
named
yourself
battle
commander.
Command.”

Her
son
looked
at
her,
startled,
as
if
he
could
not
credit
what
he
was
hearing.
“As
you
say,
Mother.”

“I’ll
ask
you
again.
What
do
you
mean
to
do?”

Robb
drew
a
map
across
the
table,
a
ragged
piece
of
old
leather
covered
with
lines
of
faded
paint.
One
end
curled
up
from
being
rolled;
he
weighed
it
down
with
his
dagger.
“Both
plans
have
virtues,
but…
look,
if
we
try
to
swing
around
Lord
Tywin’s
host,
we
take
the
risk
of
being
caught
between
him
and
the
Kingslayer,
and
if
we
attack
him…
by
all
reports,
he
has
more
men
than
I
do,
and
a
lot
more
armored
horse.
The
Greatjon
says
that
won’t
matter
if
we
catch
him
with
his
breeches
down,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
who
has
fought
as
many
battles
as
Tywin
Lannister
won’t
be
so
easily
surprised.”

“Good,”
she
said.
She
could
hear
echoes
of
Ned
in
his
voice,
as
he
sat
there,
puzzling
over
the
map.
“Tell
me
more.”

“I’d
leave
a
small
force
here
to
hold
Moat
Cailin,
archers
mostly,
and
march
the
rest
down
the
causeway,”
he
said,
“but
once
we’re
below
the
Neck,
I’d
split
our
host
in
two.
The
foot
can
continue
down
the
kingsroad,
while
our
horsemen
cross
the
Green
Fork
at
the
Twins.”
He
pointed.
“When
Lord
Tywin
gets
word
that
we’ve
come
south,
he’ll
march
north
to
engage
our
main
host,
leaving
our
riders
free
to
hurry
down
the
west
bank
to
Riverrun.”
Robb
sat
back,
not
quite
daring
to
smile,
but
pleased
with
himself
and
hungry
for
her
praise.

Catelyn
frowned
down
at
the
map.
“You’d
put
a
river
between
the
two
parts
of
your
army.”

“And
between
Jaime
and
Lord
Tywin,”
he
said
eagerly.
The
smile
came
at
last.
“There’s
no
crossing
on
the
Green
Fork
above
the
ruby
ford,
where
Robert
won
his
crown.
Not
until
the
Twins,
all
the
way
up
here,
and
Lord
Frey
controls
that
bridge.
He’s
your
father’s
bannerman,
isn’t
that
so?”

The
Late
Lord
Frey,
Catelyn
thought.
“He
is,”
she
admitted,
“but
my
father
has
never
trusted
him.
Nor
should
you.”

“I
won’t,”
Robb
promised.
“What
do
you
think?”

She
was
impressed
despite
herself.
He
looks
like
a
Tully,
she
thought,
yet
he’s
still
his
father’s
son,
and
Ned
taught
him
well.
“Which
force
would
you
command?”

“The
horse,”
he
answered
at
once.
Again
like
his
father;
Ned
would
always
take
the
more
dangerous
task
himself.

“And
the
other?”

“The
Greatjon
is
always
saying
that
we
should
smash
Lord
Tywin.
I
thought
I’d
give
him
the
honor.”

It
was
his
first
misstep,
but
how
to
make
him
see
it
without
wounding
his
fledgling
confidence?
“Your
father
once
told
me
that
the
Greatjon
was
as
fearless
as
any
man
he
had
ever
known.”

Robb
grinned.
“Grey
Wind
ate
two
of
his
fingers,
and
he
laughed
about
it.
So
you
agree,
then?”

“Your
father
is
not
fearless,”
Catelyn
pointed
out.
“He
is
brave,
but
that
is
very
different.”

Her
son
considered
that
for
a
moment.
“The
eastern
host
will
be
all
that
stands
between
Lord
Tywin
and
Winterfell,”
he
said
thoughtfully.
“Well,
them
and
whatever
few
bowmen
I
leave
here
at
the
Moat.
So
I
don’t
want
someone
fearless,
do
I?”

“No.
You
want
cold
cunning,
I
should
think,
not
courage.”

“Roose
Bolton,”
Robb
said
at
once.
“That
man
scares
me.”

“Then
let
us
pray
he
will
scare
Tywin
Lannister
as
well.”

Robb
nodded
and
rolled
up
the
map.
“I’ll
give
the
commands,
and
assemble
an
escort
to
take
you
home
to
Winterfell.”

Catelyn
had
fought
to
keep
herself
strong,
for
Ned’s
sake
and
for
this
stubborn
brave
son
of
theirs.
She
had
put
despair
and
fear
aside,
as
if
they
were
garments
she
did
not
choose
to
wear…
but
now
she
saw
that
she
had
donned
them
after
all.

“I
am
not
going
to
Winterfell,”
she
heard
herself
say,
surprised
at
the
sudden
rush
of
tears
that
blurred
her
vision.
“My
father
may
be
dying
behind
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
My
brother
is
surrounded
by
foes.
I
must
go
to
them.”

JON

It
was
dark
in
the
Skirling
Pass.
The
great
stone
flanks
of
the
mountains
hid
the
sun
for
most
of
the
day,
so
they
rode
in
shadow,
the
breath
of
man
and
horse
steaming
in
the
cold
air.
Icy
fingers
of
water
trickled
down
from
the
snowpack
above
into
small
frozen
pools
that
cracked
and
broke
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
garrons.
Sometimes
they
would
see
a
few
weeds
struggling
from
some
crack
in
the
rock
or
a
splotch
of
pale
lichen,
but
there
was
no
grass,
and
they
were
above
the
trees
now.

The
track
was
as
steep
as
it
was
narrow,
wending
its
way
ever
upward.
Where
the
pass
was
so
constricted
that
rangers
had
to
go
single
file,
Squire
Dalbridge
would
take
the
lead,
scanning
the
heights
as
he
went,
his
longbow
ever
close
to
hand.
It
was
said
he
had
the
keenest
eyes
in
the
Night’s
Watch.

Ghost
padded
restlessly
by
Jon’s
side.
From
time
to
time
he
would
stop
and
turn,
his
ears
pricked,
as
if
he
heard
something
behind
them.
Jon
did
not
think
the
shadowcats
would
attack
living
men,
not
unless
they
were
starving,
but
he
loosened
Longclaw
in
its
scabbard
even
so.

A
wind-carved
arch
of
grey
stone
marked
the
highest
point
of
the
pass.
Here
the
way
broadened
as
it
began
its
long
descent
toward
the
valley
of
the
Milkwater.
Qhorin
decreed
that
they
would
rest
here
until
the
shadows
began
to
grow
again.
“Shadows
are
friends
to
men
in
black,”
he
said.

Jon
saw
the
sense
of
that.
It
would
be
pleasant
to
ride
in
the
light
for
a
time,
to
let
the
bright
mountain
sun
soak
through
their
cloaks
and
chase
the
chill
from
their
bones,
but
they
dared
not.
Where
there
were
three
watchers
there
might
be
others,
waiting
to
sound
the
alarm.

Stonesnake
curled
up
under
his
ragged
fur
cloak
and
was
asleep
almost
at
once.
Jon
shared
his
salt
beef
with
Ghost
while
Ebben
and
Squire
Dalbridge
fed
the
horses.
Qhorin
Halfhand
sat
with
his
back
to
a
rock,
honing
the
edge
of
his
longsword
with
long
slow
strokes.
Jon
watched
the
ranger
for
a
few
moments,
then
summoned
his
courage
and
went
to
him.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“you
never
asked
me
how
it
went.
With
the
girl.”

“I
am
no
lord,
Jon
Snow.”
Qhorin
slid
the
stone
smoothly
along
the
steel
with
his
two-fingered
hand.

“She
told
me
Mance
would
take
me,
if
I
ran
with
her.”

“She
told
you
true.”

“She
even
claimed
we
were
kin.
She
told
me
a
story…”

“…of
Bael
the
Bard
and
the
rose
of
Winterfell.
So
Stonesnake
told
me.
It
happens
I
know
the
song.
Mance
would
sing
it
of
old,
when
he
came
back
from
a
ranging.
He
had
a
passion
for
wildling
music.
Aye,
and
for
their
women
as
well.”

“You
knew
him?”

“We
all
knew
him.”
His
voice
was
sad.

They
were
friends
as
well
as
brothers,
Jon
realized,
and
now
they
are
sworn
foes.
“Why
did
he
desert?”

“For
a
wench,
some
say.
For
a
crown,
others
would
have
it.”
Qhorin
tested
the
edge
of
his
sword
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb.
“He
liked
women,
Mance
did,
and
he
was
not
a
man
whose
knees
bent
easily,
that’s
true.
But
it
was
more
than
that.
He
loved
the
wild
better
than
the
Wall.
It
was
in
his
blood.
He
was
wildling
born,
taken
as
a
child
when
some
raiders
were
put
to
the
sword.
When
he
left
the
Shadow
Tower
he
was
only
going
home
again.”

“Was
he
a
good
ranger?”

“He
was
the
best
of
us,”
said
the
Halfhand,
“and
the
worst
as
well.
Only
fools
like
Thoren
Smallwood
despise
the
wildlings.
They
are
as
brave
as
we
are,
Jon.
As
strong,
as
quick,
as
clever.
But
they
have
no
discipline.
They
name
themselves
the
free
folk,
and
each
one
thinks
himself
as
good
as
a
king
and
wiser
than
a
maester.
Mance
was
the
same.
He
never
learned
how
to
obey.”

“No
more
than
me,”
said
Jon
quietly.

Qhorin’s
shrewd
grey
eyes
seemed
to
see
right
through
him.
“So
you
let
her
go?”
He
did
not
sound
the
least
surprised.

“You
know?”

“Now.
Tell
me
why
you
spared
her.”

It
was
hard
to
put
into
words.
“My
father
never
used
a
headsman.
He
said
he
owed
it
to
men
he
killed
to
look
into
their
eyes
and
hear
their
last
words.
And
when
I
looked
into
Ygritte’s
eyes,
I…”
Jon
stared
down
at
his
hands
helplessly.
“I
know
she
was
an
enemy,
but
there
was
no
evil
in
her.”

“No
more
than
in
the
other
two.”

“It
was
their
lives
or
ours
Jon
said.
“If
they
had
seen
us,
if
they
had
sounded
that
horn…”

“The
wildlings
would
hunt
us
down
and
slay
us,
true
enough.”

“Stonesnake
has
the
horn
now,
though,
and
we
took
Ygritte’s
knife
and
axe.
She’s
behind
us,
afoot,
unarmed…”

“And
not
like
to
be
a
threat,”
Qhorin
agreed.
“If
I
had
needed
her
dead,
I
would
have
left
her
with
Ebben,
or
done
the
thing
myself.”

“Then
why
did
you
command
it
of
me?”

“I
did
not
command
it.
I
told
you
to
do
what
needed
to
be
done,
and
left
you
to
decide
what
that
would
be.”
Qhorin
stood
and
slid
his
longsword
back
into
its
scabbard.
“When
I
want
a
mountain
scaled,
I
call
on
Stonesnake.
Should
I
need
to
put
an
arrow
through
the
eye
of
some
foe
across
a
windy
battlefield,
I
summon
Squire
Dalbridge.
Ebben
can
make
any
man
give
up
his
secrets.
To
lead
men
you
must
know
them,
Jon
Snow.
I
know
more
of
you
now
than
I
did
this
morning.”

“And
if
I
had
slain
her?”
asked
Jon.

“She
would
be
dead,
and
I
would
know
you
better
than
I
had
before.
But
enough
talk.
You
ought
be
sleeping.
We
have
leagues
to
go,
and
dangers
to
face.
You
will
need
your
strength.”

Jon
did
not
think
sleep
would
come
easily,
but
he
knew
the
Halfhand
was
right.
He
found
a
place
out
of
the
wind,
beneath
an
overhang
of
rock,
and
took
off
his
cloak
to
use
it
for
a
blanket.
“Ghost,”
he
called.
“Here.
To
me.”
He
always
slept
better
with
the
great
white
wolf
beside
him;
there
was
comfort
in
the
smell
of
him,
and
welcome
warmth
in
that
shaggy
pale
fur.
This
time,
though,
Ghost
did
no
more
than
look
at
him.
Then
he
turned
away
and
padded
around
the
garrons,
and
quick
as
that
he
was
gone.
He
wants
to
hunt,
Jon
thought.
Perhaps
there
were
goats
in
these
mountains.
The
shadowcats
must
live
on
something.
“Just
don’t
try
and
bring
down
a
’cat,”
he
muttered.
Even
for
a
direwolf,
that
would
be
dangerous.
He
tugged
his
cloak
over
him
and
stretched
out
beneath
the
rock.

When
he
closed
his
eyes,
he
dreamed
of
direwolves.

There
were
five
of
them
when
there
should
have
been
six,
and
they
were
scattered,
each
apart
from
the
others.
He
felt
a
deep
ache
of
emptiness,
a
sense
of
incompleteness.
The
forest
was
vast
and
cold,
and
they
were
so
small,
so
lost.
His
brothers
were
out
there
somewhere,
and
his
sister,
but
he
had
lost
their
scent.
He
sat
on
his
haunches
and
lifted
his
head
to
the
darkening
sky,
and
his
cry
echoed
through
the
forest,
a
long
lonely
mournful
sound.
As
it
died
away,
he
pricked
up
his
ears,
listening
for
an
answer,
but
the
only
sound
was
the
sigh
of
blowing
snow.

Jon?

The
call
came
from
behind
him,
softer
than
a
whisper,
but
strong
too.
Can
a
shout
be
silent?
He
turned
his
head,
searching
for
his
brother,
for
a
glimpse
of
a
lean
grey
shape
moving
beneath
the
trees,
but
there
was
nothing,
only…

A
weirwood.

It
seemed
to
sprout
from
solid
rock,
its
pale
roots
twisting
up
from
a
myriad
of
fissures
and
hairline
cracks.
The
tree
was
slender
compared
to
other
weirwoods
he
had
seen,
no
more
than
a
sapling,
yet
it
was
growing
as
he
watched,
its
limbs
thickening
as
they
reached
for
the
sky.
Wary,
he
circled
the
smooth
white
trunk
until
he
came
to
the
face.
Red
eyes
looked
at
him.
Fierce
eyes
they
were,
yet
glad
to
see
him.
The
weirwood
had
his
brother’s
face.
Had
his
brother
always
had
three
eyes?

Not
always,
came
the
silent
shout.
Not
before
the
crow.

He
sniffed
at
the
bark,
smelled
wolf
and
tree
and
boy,
but
behind
that
there
were
other
scents,
the
rich
brown
smell
of
warm
earth
and
the
hard
grey
smell
of
stone
and
something
else,
something
terrible.
Death,
he
knew.
He
was
smelling
death.
He
cringed
back,
his
hair
bristling,
and
bared
his
fangs.

Don’t
be
afraid,
I
like
it
in
the
dark.
No
one
can
see
you,
but
you
can
see
them.
But
first
you
have
to
open
your
eyes.
See?
Like
this.
And
the
tree
reached
down
and
touched
him.

And
suddenly
he
was
back
in
the
mountains,
his
paws
sunk
deep
in
a
drift
of
snow
as
he
stood
upon
the
edge
of
a
great
precipice.
Before
him
the
Skirling
Pass
opened
up
into
airy
emptiness,
and
a
long
vee-shaped
valley
lay
spread
beneath
him
like
a
quilt,
awash
in
all
the
colors
of
an
autumn
afternoon.

A
vast
blue-white
wall
plugged
one
end
of
the
vale,
squeezing
between
the
mountains
as
if
it
had
shouldered
them
aside,
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
dreamed
himself
back
to
Castle
Black.
Then
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
a
river
of
ice
several
thousand
feet
high.
Under
that
glittering
cold
cliff
was
a
great
lake,
its
deep
cobalt
waters
reflecting
the
snowcapped
peaks
that
ringed
it.
There
were
men
down
in
the
valley,
he
saw
now;
many
men,
thousands,
a
huge
host.
Some
were
tearing
great
holes
in
the
half-frozen
ground,
while
others
trained
for
war.
He
watched
as
a
swarming
mass
of
riders
charged
a
shield
wall,
astride
horses
no
larger
than
ants.
The
sound
of
their
mock
battle
was
a
rustling
of
steel
leaves,
drifting
faintly
on
the
wind.
Their
encampment
had
no
plan
to
it;
he
saw
no
ditches,
no
sharpened
stakes,
no
neat
rows
of
horse
lines.
Everywhere
crude
earthen
shelters
and
hide
tents
sprouted
haphazardly,
like
a
pox
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
He
spied
untidy
mounds
of
hay,
smelled
goats
and
sheep,
horses
and
pigs,
dogs
in
great
profusion.
Tendrils
of
dark
smoke
rose
from
a
thousand
cookfires.

This
is
no
army,
no
more
than
it
is
a
town.
This
is
a
whole
people
come
together.

Across
the
long
lake,
one
of
the
mounds
moved.
He
watched
it
more
closely
and
saw
that
it
was
not
dirt
at
all,
but
alive,
a
shaggy
lumbering
beast
with
a
snake
for
a
nose
and
tusks
larger
than
those
of
the
greatest
boar
that
had
ever
lived.
And
the
thing
riding
it
was
huge
as
well,
and
his
shape
was
wrong,
too
thick
in
the
leg
and
hips
to
be
a
man.

Then
a
sudden
gust
of
cold
made
his
fur
stand
up,
and
the
air
thrilled
to
the
sound
of
wings.
As
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
ice-white
mountain
heights
above,
a
shadow
plummeted
out
of
the
sky.
A
shrill
scream
split
the
air.
He
glimpsed
blue-grey
pinions
spread
wide,
shutting
out
the
sun…

“Ghost!”
Jon
shouted,
sitting
up.
He
could
still
feel
the
talons,
the
pain.
“Ghost,
to
me!”

Ebben
appeared,
grabbed
him,
shook
him.
“Quiet!
You
mean
to
bring
the
wildlings
down
on
us?
What’s
wrong
with
you,
boy?”

“A
dream,”
said
Jon
feebly.
“I
was
Ghost,
I
was
on
the
edge
of
the
mountain
looking
down
on
a
frozen
river,
and
something
attacked
me.
A
bird…
an
eagle,
I
think…”

Squire
Dalbridge
smiled.
“It’s
always
pretty
women
in
my
dreams.
Would
that
I
dreamed
more
often.”

Qhorin
came
up
beside
him.
“A
frozen
river,
you
say?”

“The
Milkwater
flows
from
a
great
lake
at
the
foot
of
a
glacier,”
Stonesnake
put
in.

“There
was
a
tree
with
my
brother’s
face.
The
wildlings…
there
were
thousands,
more
than
I
ever
knew
existed.
And
giants
riding
mammoths.”
From
the
way
the
light
had
shifted,
Jon
judged
that
he
had
been
asleep
for
four
or
five
hours.
His
head
ached,
and
the
back
of
his
neck
where
the
talons
had
burned
through
him.
But
that
was
in
the
dream.

“Tell
me
all
that
you
remember,
from
first
to
last,”
said
Qhorin
Halfhand.

Jon
was
confused.
“It
was
only
a
dream.”

“A
wolf
dream,”
the
Halfhand
said.
“Craster
told
the
Lord
Commander
that
the
wildlings
were
gathering
at
the
source
of
the
Milkwater.
That
may
be
why
you
dreamed
it.
Or
it
may
be
that
you
saw
what
waits
for
us,
a
few
hours
farther
on.
Tell
me.”
It
made
him
feel
half
a
fool
to
talk
of
such
things
to
Qhorin
and
the
other
rangers,
but
he
did
as
he
was
commanded.
None
of
the
black
brothers
laughed
at
him,
however.
By
the
time
he
was
done,
even
Squire
Dalbridge
was
no
longer
smiling.

“Skinchanger?”
said
Ebben
grimly,
looking
at
the
Halfhand.
Does
he
mean
the
eagle?
Jon
wondered.
Or
me?
Skinchangers
and
wargs
belonged
in
Old
Nan’s
stories,
not
in
the
world
he
had
lived
in
all
his
life.
Yet
here,
in
this
strange
bleak
wilderness
of
rock
and
ice,
it
was
not
hard
to
believe.

“The
cold
winds
are
rising.
Mormont
feared
as
much.
Benjen
Stark
felt
it
as
well.
Dead
men
walk
and
the
trees
have
eyes
again.
Why
should
we
balk
at
wargs
and
giants?”

“Does
this
mean
my
dreams
are
true
as
well?”
asked
Squire
Dalbridge.
“Lord
Snow
can
keep
his
mammoths,
I
want
my
women.”

“Man
and
boy
I’ve
served
the
Watch,
and
ranged
as
far
as
any,”
said
Ebben.
“I’ve
seen
the
bones
of
giants,
and
heard
many
a
queer
tale,
but
no
more.
I
want
to
see
them
with
my
own
eyes.”

“Be
careful
they
don’t
see
you,
Ebben,”
Stonesnake
said.

Ghost
did
not
reappear
as
they
set
out
again.
The
shadows
covered
the
floor
of
the
pass
by
then,
and
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
toward
the
jagged
twin
peaks
of
the
huge
mountain
the
rangers
named
Forktop.
If
the
dream
was
true…
Even
the
thought
scared
him.
Could
the
eagle
have
hurt
Ghost,
or
knocked
him
off
the
precipice?
And
what
about
the
weirwood
with
his
brother’s
face,
that
smelled
of
death
and
darkness?

The
last
ray
of
sun
vanished
behind
the
peaks
of
Forktop.
Twilight
filled
the
Skirling
Pass.
It
seemed
to
grow
colder
almost
at
once.
They
were
no
longer
climbing.
In
fact,
the
ground
had
begun
to
descend,
though
as
yet
not
sharply.
It
was
littered
with
cracks
and
broken
boulders
and
tumbled
heaps
of
rock.
It
will
be
dark
soon,
and
still
no
sight
of
Ghost.
It
was
tearing
Jon
apart,
yet
he
dare
not
shout
for
the
direwolf
as
he
would
have
liked.
Other
things
might
be
listening
as
well.

“Qhorin,”
Squire
Dalbridge
called
softly.
“There.
Look.”

The
eagle
was
perched
on
a
spine
of
rock
far
above
them,
outlined
against
the
darkening
sky.
We’ve
seen
other
eagles,
Jon
thought.
That
need
not
be
the
one
I
dreamed
of.

Even
so,
Ebben
would
have
loosed
a
shaft
at
it,
but
the
squire
stopped
him.
“The
bird’s
well
out
of
bowshot.”

“I
don’t
like
it
watching
us.”

The
squire
shrugged.
“Nor
me,
but
you
won’t
stop
it.
Only
waste
a
good
arrow.”

Qhorin
sat
in
his
saddle,
studying
the
eagle
for
a
long
time.
“We
press
on,”
he
finally
said.
The
rangers
resumed
their
descent.

Ghost,
Jon
wanted
to
shout,
where
are
you?

He
was
about
to
follow
Qhorin
and
the
others
when
he
glimpsed
a
flash
of
white
between
two
boulders.
A
patch
of
old
snow,
he
thought,
until
he
saw
it
stir.
He
was
off
his
horse
at
once.
As
he
went
to
his
knees,
Ghost
lifted
his
head.
His
neck
glistened
wetly,
but
he
made
no
sound
when
Jon
peeled
off
a
glove
and
touched
him.
The
talons
had
torn
a
bloody
path
through
fur
and
flesh,
but
the
bird
had
not
been
able
to
snap
his
neck.

Qhorin
Halfhand
was
standing
over
him.
“How
bad?”

As
if
in
answer,
Ghost
struggled
to
his
feet.

“The
wolf
is
strong,”
the
ranger
said.
“Ebben,
water.
Stonesnake,
your
skin
of
wine.
Hold
him
still,
Jon.”

Together
they
washed
the
caked
blood
from
the
direwolf’s
fur.
Ghost
struggled
and
bared
his
teeth
when
Qhorin
poured
the
wine
into
the
ragged
red
gashes
the
eagle
had
left
him,
but
Jon
wrapped
his
arms
around
him
and
murmured
soothing
words,
and
soon
enough
the
wolf
quieted.
By
the
time
they’d
ripped
a
strip
from
Jon’s
cloak
to
wrap
the
wounds,
full
dark
had
settled.
Only
a
dusting
of
stars
set
the
black
of
sky
apart
from
the
black
of
stone.
“Do
we
press
on?”
Stonesnake
wanted
to
know.

Qhorin
went
to
his
garron.
“Back,
not
on.”

“Back?”
Jon
was
taken
by
surprise.

“Eagles
have
sharper
eyes
than
men.
We
are
seen.
So
now
we
run.”
The
Halfhand
wound
a
long
black
scarf
around
his
face
and
swung
up
into
the
saddle.

The
other
rangers
exchanged
a
look,
but
no
man
thought
to
argue.
One
by
one
they
mounted
and
turned
their
mounts
toward
home.
“Ghost,
come,”
he
called,
and
the
direwolf
followed,
a
pale
shadow
moving
through
the
night.

All
night
they
rode,
feeling
their
way
up
the
twisting
pass
and
through
the
stretches
of
broken
ground.
The
wind
grew
stronger.
Sometimes
it
was
so
dark
that
they
dismounted
and
went
ahead
on
foot,
each
man
leading
his
garron.
Once
Ebben
suggested
that
some
torches
might
serve
them
well,
but
Qhorin
said,
“No
fire,”
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
They
reached
the
stone
bridge
at
the
summit
and
began
to
descend
again.
Off
in
the
darkness
a
shadowcat
screamed
in
fury,
its
voice
bouncing
off
the
rocks
so
it
seemed
as
though
a
dozen
other
’cats
were
giving
answer.
Once
Jon
thought
he
saw
a
pair
of
glowing
eyes
on
a
ledge
overhead,
as
big
as
harvest
moons.

In
the
black
hour
before
dawn,
they
stopped
to
let
the
horses
drink
and
fed
them
each
a
handful
of
oats
and
a
twist
or
two
of
hay.
“We
are
not
far
from
the
place
the
wildlings
died,”
said
Qhorin.
“From
there,
one
man
could
hold
a
hundred.
The
right
man.”
He
looked
at
Squire
Dalbridge.

The
squire
bowed
his
head.
“Leave
me
as
many
arrows
as
you
can
spare,
brothers.”
He
stroked
his
longbow.
“And
see
my
garron
has
an
apple
when
you’re
home.
He’s
earned
it,
poor
beastie.”

He’s
staying
to
die,
Jon
realized.

Qhorin
clasped
the
squire’s
forearm
with
a
gloved
hand.
“If
the
eagle
flies
down
for
a
look
at
you…”

“…he’ll
sprout
some
new
feathers.”

The
last
Jon
saw
of
Squire
Dalbridge
was
his
back
as
he
clambered
up
the
narrow
path
to
the
heights.

When
dawn
broke,
Jon
looked
up
into
a
cloudless
sky
and
saw
a
speck
moving
through
the
blue.
Ebben
saw
it
too,
and
cursed,
but
Qhorin
told
him
to
be
quiet.
“Listen.”

Jon
held
his
breath,
and
heard
it.
Far
away
and
behind
them,
the
call
of
a
hunting
horn
echoed
against
the
mountains.

“And
now
they
come,”
said
Qhorin.





TYRION

Pod
dressed
him
for
his
ordeal
in
a
plush
velvet
tunic
of
Lannister
crimson
and
brought
him
his
chain
of
office.
Tyrion
left
it
on
the
bedside
table.
His
sister
misliked
being
reminded
that
he
was
the
King’s
Hand,
and
he
did
not
wish
to
inflame
the
relations
between
them
any
further.

Varys
caught
up
with
him
as
he
was
crossing
the
yard.
=======
TYRION

Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
of
the
Black
Ears
had
gone
ahead
to
scout,
and
it
was
she
who
brought
back
word
of
the
army
at
the
crossroads.
“By
their
fires
I
call
them
twenty
thousand
strong,”
she
said.
“Their
banners
are
red,
with
a
golden
lion.”

“Your
father?”
Bronn
asked.

“Or
my
brother
Jaime,”
Tyrion
said.
“We
shall
know
soon
enough.”
He
surveyed
his
ragged
band
of
brigands:
near
three
hundred
Stone
Crows,
Moon
Brothers,
Black
Ears,
and
Burned
Men,
and
those
just
the
seed
of
the
army
he
hoped
to
grow.
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn
was
raising
the
other
clans
even
now.
He
wondered
what
his
lord
father
would
make
of
them
in
their
skins
and
bits
of
stolen
steel.
If
truth
be
told,
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
them
himself.
Was
he
their
commander
or
their
captive?
Most
of
the
time,
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
of
both.
“It
might
be
best
if
I
rode
down
alone,”
he
suggested.

“Best
for
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin,”
said
Ulf,
who
spoke
for
the
Moon
Brothers.

Shagga
glowered,
a
fearsome
sight
to
see.
“Shagga
son
of
Dolf
likes
this
not.
Shagga
will
go
with
the
boyman,
and
if
the
boyman
lies,
Shagga
will
chop
off
his
manhood—”

“—and
feed
it
to
the
goats,
yes,”
Tyrion
said
wearily.
“Shagga,
I
give
you
my
word
as
a
Lannister,
I
will
return.”

“Why
should
we
trust
your
word?”
Chella
was
a
small
hard
woman,
flat
as
a
boy,
and
no
fool.
“Lowland
lords
have
lied
to
the
clans
before.”

“You
wound
me,
Chella,”
Tyrion
said.
“Here
I
thought
we
had
become
such
friends.
But
as
you
will.
You
shall
ride
with
me,
and
Shagga
and
Conn
for
the
Stone
Crows,
Ulf
for
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
Timett
son
of
Timett
for
the
Burned
Men.”
The
clansmen
exchanged
wary
looks
as
he
named
them.
“The
rest
shall
wait
here
until
I
send
for
you.
Try
not
to
kill
and
maim
each
other
while
I’m
gone.”

He
put
his
heels
to
his
horse
and
trotted
off,
giving
them
no
choice
but
to
follow
or
be
left
behind.
Either
was
fine
with
him,
so
long
as
they
did
not
sit
down
to
talk
for
a
day
and
a
night.
That
was
the
trouble
with
the
clans;
they
had
an
absurd
notion
that
every
man’s
voice
should
be
heard
in
council,
so
they
argued
about
everything,
endlessly.
Even
their
women
were
allowed
to
speak.
Small
wonder
that
it
had
been
hundreds
of
years
since
they
last
threatened
the
Vale
with
anything
beyond
an
occasional
raid.
Tyrion
meant
to
change
that.

Brorm
rode
with
him.
Behind
them—after
a
quick
bit
of
grumbling—the
five
clansmen
followed
on
their
undersize
garrons,
scrawny
things
that
looked
like
ponies
and
scrambled
up
rock
walls
like
goats.

The
Stone
Crows
rode
together,
and
Chella
and
Ulf
stayed
close
as
well,
as
the
Moon
Brothers
and
Black
Ears
had
strong
bonds
between
them.
Timett
son
of
Timett
rode
alone.
Every
clan
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
feared
the
Burned
Men,
who
mortified
their
flesh
with
fire
to
prove
their
courage
and
(the
others
said)
roasted
babies
at
their
feasts.
And
even
the
other
Burned
Men
feared
Timett,
who
had
put
out
his
own
left
eye
with
a
white-hot
knife
when
he
reached
the
age
of
manhood.
Tyrion
gathered
that
it
was
more
customary
for
a
boy
to
burn
off
a
nipple,
a
finger,
or
(if
he
was
truly
brave,
or
truly
mad)
an
ear.
Timett’s
fellow
Burned
Men
were
so
awed
by
his
choice
of
an
eye
that
they
promptly
named
him
a
red
hand,
which
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
a
war
chief.

“I
wonder
what
their
king
burned
off,”
Tyrion
said
to
Bronn
when
he
heard
the
tale.
Grinning,
the
sellsword
had
tugged
at
his
crotch…
but
even
Bronn
kept
a
respectful
tongue
around
Timett.
If
a
man
was
mad
enough
to
put
out
his
own
eye,
he
was
unlikely
to
be
gentle
to
his
enemies.

Distant
watchers
peered
down
from
towers
of
unmortared
stone
as
the
party
descended
through
the
foothills,
and
once
Tyrion
saw
a
raven
take
wing.
Where
the
high
road
twisted
between
two
rocky
outcrops,
they
came
to
the
first
strong
point.
A
low
earthen
wall
four
feet
high
closed
off
the
road,
and
a
dozen
crossbowmen
manned
the
heights.
Tyrion
halted
his
followers
out
of
range
and
rode
to
the
wall
alone.
“Who
commands
here?”
he
shouted
up.

The
captain
was
quick
to
appear,
and
even
quicker
to
give
them
an
escort
when
he
recognized
his
lord’s
son.
They
trotted
past
blackened
fields
and
burned
holdfasts,
down
to
the
riverlands
and
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Tyrion
saw
no
bodies,
but
the
air
was
full
of
ravens
and
carrion
crows;
there
had
been
fighting
here,
and
recently.

Half
a
league
from
the
crossroads,
a
barricade
of
sharpened
stakes
had
been
erected,
manned
by
pikemen
and
archers.
Behind
the
line,
the
camp
spread
out
to
the
far
distance.
Thin
fingers
of
smoke
rose
from
hundreds
of
cookfires,
mailed
men
sat
under
trees
and
honed
their
blades,
and
familiar
banners
fluttered
from
staffs
thrust
into
the
muddy
ground.

A
party
of
mounted
horsemen
rode
forward
to
challenge
them
as
they
approached
the
stakes.
The
knight
who
led
them
wore
silver
armor
inlaid
with
amethysts
and
a
striped
purple-and-silver
cloak.
His
shield
bore
a
unicorn
sigil,
and
a
spiral
horn
two
feet
long
jutted
up
from
the
brow
of
his
horsehead
helm.
Tyrion
reined
up
to
greet
him.
“Ser
Flement.”

Ser
Flement
Brax
lifted
his
visor.
“Tyrion,”
he
said
in
astonishment.
“My
lord,
we
all
feared
you
dead,
or…”
He
looked
at
the
clansmen
uncertainly.
“These…
companions
of
yours…”

“Bosom
friends
and
loyal
retainers,”
Tyrion
said.
“Where
will
I
find
my
lord
father?”

“He
has
taken
the
inn
at
the
crossroads
for
his
quarters.”

Tyrion
laughed.
The
inn
at
the
crossroads!
Perhaps
the
gods
were
just
after
all.
“I
will
see
him
at
once.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Ser
Flement
wheeled
his
horse
about
and
shouted
commands.
Three
rows
of
stakes
were
pulled
from
the
ground
to
make
a
hole
in
the
line.
Tyrion
led
his
party
through.

Lord
Tywin’s
camp
spread
over
leagues.
Chella’s
estimate
of
twenty
thousand
men
could
not
be
far
wrong.
The
common
men
camped
out
in
the
open,
but
the
knights
had
thrown
up
tents,
and
some
of
the
high
lords
had
erected
pavilions
as
large
as
houses.
Tyrion
spied
the
red
ox
of
the
Presters,
Lord
Crakehall’s
brindled
boar,
the
burning
tree
of
Marbrand,
the
badger
of
Lydden.
Knights
called
out
to
him
as
he
cantered
past,
and
men-at-arms
gaped
at
the
clansmen
in
open
astonishment.

Shagga
was
gaping
back;
beyond
a
certainty,
he
had
never
seen
so
many
men,
horses,
and
weapons
in
all
his
days.
The
rest
of
the
mountain
brigands
did
a
better
job
of
guarding
their
faces,
but
Tyrion
had
no
doubts
that
they
were
full
as
much
in
awe.
Better
and
better.
The
more
impressed
they
were
with
the
power
of
the
Lannisters,
the
easier
they
would
be
to
command.

The
inn
and
its
stables
were
much
as
he
remembered,
though
little
more
than
tumbled
stones
and
blackened
foundations
remained
where
the
rest
of
the
village
had
stood.
A
gibbet
had
been
erected
in
the
yard,
and
the
body
that
swung
there
was
covered
with
ravens.
At
Tyrion’s
approach
they
took
to
the
air,
squawking
and
flapping
their
black
wings.
He
dismounted
and
glanced
up
at
what
remained
of
the
corpse.
The
birds
had
eaten
her
lips
and
eyes
and
most
of
her
cheeks,
baring
her
stained
red
teeth
in
a
hideous
smile.
“A
room,
a
meal,
and
a
flagon
of
wine,
that
was
all
I
asked,”
he
reminded
her
with
a
sigh
of
reproach.

Boys
emerged
hesitantly
from
the
stables
to
see
to
their
horses.
Shagga
did
not
want
to
give
his
up.
“The
lad
won’t
steal
your
mare,”
Tyrion
assured
him.
“He
only
wants
to
give
her
some
oats
and
water
and
brush
out
her
coat.”
Shagga’s
coat
could
have
used
a
good
brushing
too,
but
it
would
have
been
less
than
tactful
to
mention
it.
“You
have
my
word,
the
horse
will
not
be
harmed.”

Glaring,
Shagga
let
go
his
grip
on
the
reins.
“This
is
the
horse
of
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,”
he
roared
at
the
stableboy.

“If
he
doesn’t
give
her
back,
chop
off
his
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats,”
Tyrion
promised.
“Provided
you
can
find
some.”

A
pair
of
house
guards
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms
stood
under
the
inn’s
sign,
on
either
side
of
the
door.
Tyrion
recognized
their
captain.
“My
father?”

“In
the
common
room,
m’lord.”

“My
men
will
want
meat
and
mead,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“See
that
they
get
it.”
He
entered
the
inn,
and
there
was
Father.

Tywin
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Warden
of
the
West,
was
in
his
middle
fifties,
yet
hard
as
a
man
of
twenty.
Even
seated,
he
was
tall,
with
long
legs,
broad
shoulders,
a
flat
stomach.
His
thin
arms
were
corded
with
muscle.
When
his
once-thick
golden
hair
had
begun
to
recede,
he
had
commanded
his
barber
to
shave
his
head;
Lord
Tywin
did
not
believe
in
half
measures.
He
razored
his
lip
and
chin
as
well,
but
kept
his
side-whiskers,
two
great
thickets
of
wiry
golden
hair
that
covered
most
of
his
cheeks
from
ear
to
jaw.
His
eyes
were
a
pale
green,
flecked
with
gold.
A
fool
more
foolish
than
most
had
once
jested
that
even
Lord
Tywin’s
shit
was
flecked
with
gold.
Some
said
the
man
was
still
alive,
deep
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock.

Ser
Kevan
Lannister,
his
father’s
only
surviving
brother,
was
sharing
a
flagon
of
ale
with
Lord
Tywin
when
Tyrion
entered
the
common
room.
His
uncle
was
portly
and
balding,
with
a
close-cropped
yellow
beard
that
followed
the
line
of
his
massive
jaw.
Ser
Kevan
saw
him
first.
“Tyrion,”
he
said
in
surprise.

“Uncle,”
Tyrion
said,
bowing.
“And
my
lord
father.
What
a
pleasure
to
find
you
here.”

Lord
Tywin
did
not
stir
from
his
chair,
but
he
did
give
his
dwarf
son
a
long,
searching
look.
“I
see
that
the
rumors
of
your
demise
were
unfounded.”

“Sorry
to
disappoint
you,
Father,”
Tyrion
said.
“No
need
to
leap
up
and
embrace
me,
I
wouldn’t
want
you
to
strain
yourself.”
He
crossed
the
room
to
their
table,
acutely
conscious
of
the
way
his
stunted
legs
made
him
waddle
with
every
step.
Whenever
his
father’s
eyes
were
on
him,
he
became
uncomfortably
aware
of
all
his
deformities
and
shortcomings.
“Kind
of
you
to
go
to
war
for
me,”
he
said
as
he
climbed
into
a
chair
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
his
father’s
ale.

“By
my
lights,
it
was
you
who
started
this,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“Your
brother
Jaime
would
never
have
meekly
submitted
to
capture
at
the
hands
of
a
woman.”

“That’s
one
way
we
differ,
Jaime
and
I.
He’s
taller
as
well,
you
may
have
noticed.”

His
father
ignored
the
sally.
“The
honor
of
our
House
was
at
stake.
I
had
no
choice
but
to
ride.
No
man
sheds
Lannister
blood
with
impunity.”

“Hear
Me
Roar,”
Tyrion
said,
grinning.
The
Lannister
words.
“Truth
be
told,
none
of
my
blood
was
actually
shed,
although
it
was
a
close
thing
once
or
twice.
Morrec
and
Jyck
were
killed.”

“I
suppose
you
will
be
wanting
some
new
men.”

“Don’t
trouble
yourself,
Father,
I’ve
acquired
a
few
of
my
own.”
He
tried
a
swallow
of
the
ale.
It
was
brown
and
yeasty,
so
thick
you
could
almost
chew
it.
Very
fine,
in
truth.
A
pity
his
father
had
hanged
the
innkeep.
“How
is
your
war
going?”

His
uncle
answered.
“Well
enough,
for
the
nonce.
Ser
Edmure
had
scattered
small
troops
of
men
along
his
borders
to
stop
our
raiding,
and
your
lord
father
and
I
were
able
to
destroy
most
of
them
piecemeal
before
they
could
regroup.”

“Your
brother
has
been
covering
himself
with
glory,”
his
father
said.
“He
smashed
the
Lords
Vance
and
Piper
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
and
met
the
massed
power
of
the
Tullys
under
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
The
lords
of
the
Trident
have
been
put
to
rout.
Ser
Edmure
Tully
was
taken
captive,
with
many
of
his
knights
and
bannermen.
Lord
Blackwood
led
a
few
survivors
back
to
Riverrun,
where
Jaime
has
them
under
siege.
The
rest
fled
to
their
own
strongholds.”

“Your
father
and
I
have
been
marching
on
each
in
turn,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“With
Lord
Blackwood
gone,
Raventree
fell
at
once,
and
Lady
Whent
yielded
Harrenhal
for
want
of
men
to
defend
it.
Ser
Gregor
burnt
out
the
Pipers
and
the
Brackens…”

“Leaving
you
unopposed?”
Tyrion
said.

“Not
wholly,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“The
Mallisters
still
hold
Seagard
and
Walder
Frey
is
marshaling
his
levies
at
the
Twins.”

“No
matter,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“Frey
only
takes
the
field
when
the
scent
of
victory
is
in
the
air,
and
all
he
smells
now
is
ruin.
And
Jason
Mallister
lacks
the
strength
to
fight
alone.
Once
Jaime
takes
Riverrun,
they
will
both
be
quick
enough
to
bend
the
knee.
Unless
the
Starks
and
the
Arryns
come
forth
to
oppose
us,
this
war
is
good
as
won.”

“I
would
not
fret
overmuch
about
the
Arryns
if
I
were
you,”
Tyrion
said.
“The
Starks
are
another
matter.
Lord
Eddard—”

“—is
our
hostage,”
his
father
said.
“He
will
lead
no
armies
while
he
rots
in
a
dungeon
under
the
Red
Keep.”

“No,”
Ser
Kevan
agreed,
“but
his
son
has
called
the
banners
and
sits
at
Moat
Cailin
with
a
strong
host
around
him.”

“No
sword
is
strong
until
it’s
been
tempered,”
Lord
Tywin
declared.
“The
Stark
boy
is
a
child.
No
doubt
he
likes
the
sound
of
warhorns
well
enough,
and
the
sight
of
his
banners
fluttering
in
the
wind,
but
in
the
end
it
comes
down
to
butcher’s
work.
I
doubt
he
has
the
stomach
for
it.”

Things
had
gotten
interesting
while
he’d
been
away,
Tyrion
reflected.
“And
what
is
our
fearless
monarch
doing
whilst
all
this
‘butcher’s
work’
is
being
done?”
he
wondered.
“How
has
my
lovely
and
persuasive
sister
gotten
Robert
to
agree
to
the
imprisonment
of
his
dear
friend
Ned?”

“Robert
Baratheon
is
dead,”
his
father
told
him.
“Your
nephew
reigns
in
King’s
Landing.”

That
did
take
Tyrion
aback.
“My
sister,
you
mean.”
He
took
another
gulp
of
ale.
The
realm
would
be
a
much
different
place
with
Cersei
ruling
in
place
of
her
husband.

“If
you
have
a
mind
to
make
yourself
of
use,
I
will
give
you
a
command,”
his
father
said.
“Marq
Piper
and
Karyl
Vance
are
loose
in
our
rear,
raiding
our
lands
across
the
Red
Fork.”

Tyrion
made
a
tsking
sound.
“The
gall
of
them,
fighting
back.
Ordinarily
I’d
be
glad
to
punish
such
rudeness,
Father,
but
the
truth
is,
I
have
pressing
business
elsewhere.”

“Do
you?”
Lord
Tywin
did
not
seem
awed.
“We
also
have
a
pair
of
Ned
Stark’s
afterthoughts
making
a
nuisance
of
themselves
by
harassing
my
foraging
parties.
Beric
Dondarrion,
some
young
lordling
with
delusions
of
valor.
He
has
that
fat
jape
of
a
priest
with
him,
the
one
who
likes
to
set
his
sword
on
fire.
Do
you
think
you
might
be
able
to
deal
with
them
as
you
scamper
off?
Without
making
too
much
a
botch
of
it?”

Tyrion
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
smiled.
“Father,
it
warms
my
heart
to
think
that
you
might
entrust
me
with…
what,
twenty
men?
Fifty?
Are
you
sure
you
can
spare
so
many?
Well,
no
matter.
If
I
should
come
across
Thoros
and
Lord
Beric,
I
shall
spank
them
both.”
He
climbed
down
from
his
chair
and
waddled
to
the
sideboard,
where
a
wheel
of
veined
white
cheese
sat
surrounded
by
fruit.
“First,
though,
I
have
some
promises
of
my
own
to
keep,”
he
said
as
he
sliced
off
a
wedge.
“I
shall
require
three
thousand
helms
and
as
many
hauberks,
plus
swords,
pikes,
steel
spearheads,
maces,
battleaxes,
gauntlets,
gorgets,
greaves,
breastplates,
wagons
to
carry
all
this—”

The
door
behind
him
opened
with
a
crash,
so
violently
that
Tyrion
almost
dropped
his
cheese.
Ser
Kevan
leapt
up
swearing
as
the
captain
of
the
guard
went
flying
across
the
room
to
smash
against
the
hearth.
As
he
tumbled
down
into
the
cold
ashes,
his
lion
helm
askew,
Shagga
snapped
the
man’s
sword
in
two
over
a
knee
thick
as
a
tree
trunk,
threw
down
the
pieces,
and
lumbered
into
the
common
room.
He
was
preceded
by
his
stench,
riper
than
the
cheese
and
overpowering
in
the
closed
space.
“Little
redcape,”
he
snarled,
“when
next
you
bare
steel
on
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,
I
will
chop
off
your
manhood
and
roast
it
in
the
fire.”

“What,
no
goats?”
Tyrion
said,
taking
a
bite
of
cheese.

The
other
clansmen
followed
Shagga
into
the
common
room,
Bronn
with
them.
The
sellsword
gave
Tyrion
a
rueful
shrug.

“Who
might
you
be?”
Lord
Tywin
asked,
cool
as
snow.

“They
followed
me
home,
Father,”
Tyrion
explained.
“May
I
keep
them?
They
don’t
eat
much.”

No
one
was
smiling.
“By
what
right
do
you
savages
intrude
on
our
councils?”
demanded
Ser
Kevan.

“Savages,
lowlander?”
Conn
might
have
been
handsome
if
you
washed
him.
“We
are
free
men,
and
free
men
by
rights
sit
on
all
war
councils.”

“Which
one
is
the
lion
lord?”
Chella
asked.

“They
are
both
old
men,”
announced
Timett
son
of
Timett,
who
had
yet
to
see
his
twentieth
year.

Ser
Kevan’s
hand
went
to
his
sword
hilt,
but
his
brother
placed
two
fingers
on
his
wrist
and
held
him
fast.
Lord
Tywin
seemed
unperturbed.
“Tyrion,
have
you
forgotten
your
courtesies?
Kindly
acquaint
us
with
our…
honored
guests.”

Tyrion
licked
his
fingers.
“With
pleasure,”
he
said.
“The
fair
maid
is
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
of
the
Black
Ears.”

“I’m
no
maid,”
Chella
protested.
“My
sons
have
taken
fifty
ears
among
them.”

“May
they
take
fifty
more.”
Tyrion
waddled
away
from
her.
“This
is
Conn
son
of
Coratt.
Shagga
son
of
Dolf
is
the
one
who
looks
like
Casterly
Rock
with
hair.
They
are
Stone
Crows.
Here
is
Ulf
son
of
Umar
of
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
here
Timett
son
of
Timett,
a
red
hand
of
the
Burned
Men.
And
this
is
Bronn,
a
sellsword
of
no
particular
allegiance.
He
has
already
changed
sides
twice
in
the
short
time
I’ve
known
him,
you
and
he
ought
to
get
on
famously,
Father.”
To
Bronn
and
the
clansmen
he
said,
“May
I
present
my
lord
father,
Tywin
son
of
Tytos
of
House
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock,
Warden
of
the
West,
Shield
of
Lannisport,
and
once
and
future
Hand
of
the
King.”

Lord
Tywin
rose,
dignified
and
correct.
“Even
in
the
west,
we
know
the
prowess
of
the
warrior
clans
of
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
What
brings
you
down
from
your
strongholds,
my
lords?”

“Horses,”
said
Shagga.

“A
promise
of
silk
and
steel,”
said
Timett
son
of
Timett.

Tyrion
was
about
to
tell
his
lord
father
how
he
proposed
to
reduce
the
Vale
of
Arryn
to
a
smoking
wasteland,
but
he
was
never
given
the
chance.
The
door
banged
open
again.
The
messenger
gave
Tyrion’s
clansmen
a
quick,
queer
look
as
he
dropped
to
one
knee
before
Lord
Tywin.
>>>>>>> asd
“My
lord,”
he
said,
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
a
little
out
of
breath.
“You
had
best
read
this
at
once.”
He
held
out
a
parchment
in
a
soft
white
hand.
“A
report
from
the
north.”

“Good
news
or
bad?”
Tyrion
asked.

“That
is
not
for
me
to
judge.”

Tyrion
unrolled
the
parchment.
He
had
to
squint
to
read
the
words
in
the
torchlit
yard.
“Gods
be
good,”
he
said
softly.
“Both
of
them?”

“I
fear
so,
my
lord.
It
is
so
sad.
So
grievous
sad.
And
them
so
young
and
innocent.”

Tyrion
remembered
how
the
wolves
had
howled
when
the
Stark
boy
had
fallen.
Are
they
howling
now,
I
wonder?
“Have
you
told
anyone
else?”
he
asked.

“Not
as
yet,
though
of
course
I
must.”

He
rolled
up
the
letter.
“I’ll
tell
my
sister.”
He
wanted
to
see
how
she
took
the
news.
He
wanted
that
very
much.

The
queen
looked
especially
lovely
that
night.
She
wore
a
low-cut
gown
of
deep
green
velvet
that
brought
out
the
color
of
her
eyes.
Her
golden
hair
tumbled
across
her
bare
shoulders,
and
around
her
waist
was
a
woven
belt
studded
with
emeralds.
Tyrion
waited
until
he
had
been
seated
and
served
a
cup
of
wine
before
thrusting
the
letter
at
her.
He
said
not
a
word.
Cersei
blinked
at
him
innocently
and
took
the
parchment
from
his
hand.

“I
trust
you’re
pleased,”
he
said
as
she
read.
“You
wanted
the
Stark
boy
dead,
I
believe.”

Cersei
made
a
sour
face.
“It
was
Jaime
who
threw
him
from
that
window,
not
me.
For
love,
he
said,
as
if
that
would
please
me.
It
was
a
stupid
thing
to
do,
and
dangerous
besides,
but
when
did
our
sweet
brother
ever
stop
to
think?”

“The
boy
saw
you,”
Tyrion
pointed
out.

“He
was
a
child.
I
could
have
frightened
him
into
silence.”
She
looked
at
the
letter
thoughtfully.
“Why
must
I
suffer
accusations
every
time
some
Stark
stubs
his
toe?
This
was
Greyjoy’s
work,
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.”

“Let
us
hope
Lady
Catelyn
believes
that.”

Her
eyes
widened.
“She
wouldn’t—”

“—kill
Jaime?
Why
not?
What
would
you
do
if
Joffrey
and
Tommen
were
murdered?”

“I
still
hold
Sansa!”
the
queen
declared.

“We
still
hold
Sansa,”
he
corrected
her,
“and
we
had
best
take
good
care
of
her.
Now
where
is
this
supper
you’ve
promised
me,
sweet
sister?”

Cersei
set
a
tasty
table,
that
could
not
be
denied.
They
started
with
a
creamy
chestnut
soup,
crusty
hot
bread,
and
greens
dressed
with
apples
and
pine
nuts.
Then
came
lamprey
pie,
honeyed
ham,
buttered
carrots,
white
beans
and
bacon,
and
roast
swan
stuffed
with
mushrooms
and
oysters.
Tyrion
was
exceedingly
courteous;
he
offered
his
sister
the
choice
portions
of
every
dish,
and
made
certain
he
ate
only
what
she
did.
Not
that
he
truly
thought
she’d
poison
him,
but
it
never
hurt
to
be
careful.

The
news
about
the
Starks
had
soured
her,
he
could
see.
“We’ve
had
no
word
from
Bitterbridge?”
she
asked
anxiously
as
she
speared
a
bit
of
apple
on
the
point
of
her
dagger
and
ate
it
with
small,
delicate
bites.

“None.”

“I’ve
never
trusted
Littlefinger.
For
enough
coin,
he’d
go
over
to
Stannis
in
a
heartbeat.”

“Stannis
Baratheon
is
too
bloody
righteous
to
buy
men.
Nor
would
he
make
a
comfortable
lord
for
the
likes
of
Petyr.
This
war
has
made
for
some
queer
bedfellows,
I
agree,
but
those
two?
No.”

As
he
carved
some
slices
off
the
ham,
she
said,
“We
have
Lady
Tanda
to
thank
for
the
pig.”

“A
token
of
her
love?”

“A
bribe.
She
begs
leave
to
return
to
her
castle.
Your
leave
as
well
as
mine.
I
suspect
she
fears
you’ll
arrest
her
on
the
road,
as
you
did
Lord
Gyles.”

“Does
she
plan
to
make
off
with
the
heir
to
the
throne?”
Tyrion
served
his
sister
a
cut
of
ham
and
took
one
for
himself.
“I’d
sooner
she
remain.
If
she
wants
to
feel
safe,
tell
her
to
bring
down
her
garrison
from
Stokeworth.
As
many
men
as
she
has.”

“If
we
need
men
so
badly,
why
did
you
send
away
your
savages?”
A
certain
testiness
crept
into
Cersei’s
voice.

“It
was
the
best
use
I
could
have
made
of
them,”
he
told
her
truthfully.
“They’re
fierce
warriors,
but
not
soldiers.
In
formal
battle,
discipline
is
more
important
than
courage.
They’ve
already
done
us
more
good
in
the
kingswood
than
they
would
ever
have
done
us
on
the
city
walls.”

As
the
swan
was
being
served,
the
queen
questioned
him
about
the
conspiracy
of
the
Antler
Men.
She
seemed
more
annoyed
than
afraid.
“Why
are
we
plagued
with
so
many
treasons?
What
injury
has
House
Lannister
ever
done
these
wretches?”

“None,”
said
Tyrion,
“but
they
think
to
be
on
the
winning
side…
which
makes
them
fools
as
well
as
traitors.”

“Are
you
certain
you’ve
found
them
all?”

“Varys
says
so.”
The
swan
was
too
rich
for
his
taste.

A
line
appeared
on
Cersei’s
pale
white
brow,
between
those
lovely
eyes.
“You
put
too
much
trust
in
that
eunuch.”

“He
serves
me
well.”

“Or
so
he’d
have
you
believe.
You
think
you’re
the
only
one
he
whispers
secrets
to?
He
gives
each
of
us
just
enough
to
convince
us
that
we’d
be
helpless
without
him.
He
played
the
same
game
with
me,
when
I
first
wed
Robert.
For
years,
I
was
convinced
I
had
no
truer
friend
at
court,
but
now…”
She
studied
his
face
for
a
moment.
“He
says
you
mean
to
take
the
Hound
from
Joffrey.”

Damn
Varys.
“I
need
Clegane
for
more
important
duties.”

“Nothing
is
more
important
than
the
life
of
the
king.”

“The
life
of
the
king
is
not
at
risk.
Joff
will
have
brave
Ser
Osmund
guarding
him,
and
Meryn
Trant
as
well.”
They’re
good
for
nothing
better.
“I
need
Balon
Swann
and
the
Hound
to
lead
sorties,
to
make
certain
Stannis
gets
no
toehold
on
our
side
of
the
Blackwater.”

“Jaime
would
lead
the
sorties
himself.”

“From
Riverrun?
That’s
quite
a
sortie.”

“Joff’s
only
a
boy.”

“A
boy
who
wants
to
be
part
of
this
battle,
and
for
once
he’s
showing
some
sense.
I
don’t
intend
to
put
him
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting,
but
he
needs
to
be
seen.
Men
fight
more
fiercely
for
a
king
who
shares
their
peril
than
one
who
hides
behind
his
mother’s
skirts.”

“He’s
thirteen,
Tyrion.”

“Remember
Jaime
at
thirteen?
If
you
want
the
boy
to
be
his
father’s
son,
let
him
play
the
part.
Joff
wears
the
finest
armor
gold
can
buy,
and
he’ll
have
a
dozen
gold
cloaks
around
him
at
all
times.
If
the
city
looks
to
be
in
the
least
danger
of
falling,
I’ll
have
him
escorted
back
to
the
Red
Keep
at
once.”

He
had
thought
that
might
reassure
her,
but
he
saw
no
sign
of
pleasure
in
those
green
eyes.
“Will
the
city
fall?”

“No.”
But
if
it
does,
pray
that
we
can
hold
the
Red
Keep
long
enough
for
our
lord
father
to
march
to
our
relief.

“You’ve
lied
to
me
before,
Tyrion.”

“Always
with
good
reason,
sweet
sister.
I
want
amity
between
us
as
much
as
you
do.
I’ve
decided
to
release
Lord
Gyles.”
He
had
kept
Gyles
safe
for
just
this
gesture.
“You
can
have
Ser
Boros
Blount
back
as
well.”

The
queen’s
mouth
tightened.
“Ser
Boros
can
rot
at
Rosby,”
she
said,
“but
Tommen—”

“—stays
where
he
is.
He’s
safer
under
Lord
Jacelyn’s
protection
than
he
would
ever
have
been
with
Lord
Gyles.”

Serving
men
cleared
away
the
swan,
hardly
touched.
Cersei
beckoned
for
the
sweet.
“I
hope
you
like
blackberry
tarts.”

“I
love
all
sorts
of
tarts.”

“Oh,
I’ve
known
that
a
long
while.
Do
you
know
why
Varys
is
so
dangerous?”

“Are
we
playing
at
riddles
now?
No.”

“He
doesn’t
have
a
cock.”

“Neither
do
you.”
And
don’t
you
just
hate
that,
Cersei?

“Perhaps
I’m
dangerous
too.
You,
on
the
other
hand,
are
as
big
a
fool
as
every
other
man.
That
worm
between
your
legs
does
half
your
thinking.”

Tyrion
licked
the
crumbs
off
his
fingers.
He
did
not
like
his
sister’s
smile.
“Yes,
and
just
now
my
worm
is
thinking
that
perhaps
it
is
time
I
took
my
leave.”

“Are
you
unwell,
brother?”
She
leaned
forward,
giving
him
a
good
look
at
the
top
of
her
breasts.
“Suddenly
you
appear
somewhat
flustered.”

“Flustered?”
Tyrion
glanced
at
the
door.
He
thought
he’d
heard
something
outside.
He
was
beginning
to
regret
coming
here
alone.
“You’ve
never
shown
much
interest
in
my
cock
before.”

“It’s
not
your
cock
that
interests
me,
so
much
as
what
you
stick
it
in.
I
don’t
depend
on
the
eunuch
for
everything,
as
you
do.
I
have
my
own
ways
of
finding
out
things…
especially
things
that
people
don’t
want
me
to
know.”

“What
are
you
trying
to
say?”

“Only
this—I
have
your
little
whore.”

Tyrion
reached
for
his
wine
cup,
buying
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts.
“I
thought
men
were
more
to
your
taste.”

“You’re
such
a
droll
little
fellow.
Tell
me,
have
you
married
this
one
yet?”
When
he
gave
her
no
answer
she
laughed
and
said,
“Father
will
be
ever
so
relieved.”

His
belly
felt
as
if
it
were
full
of
eels.
How
had
she
found
Shae?
Had
Varys
betrayed
him?
Or
had
all
his
precautions
been
undone
by
his
impatience
the
night
he
rode
directly
to
the
manse?
“Why
should
you
care
who
I
choose
to
warm
my
bed?”

“A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts,”
she
said.
“You’ve
been
scheming
against
me
since
the
day
you
came
to
King’s
Landing.
You
sold
Myrcella,
stole
Tommen,
and
now
you
plot
to
have
Joff
killed.
You
want
him
dead
so
you
can
rule
through
Tommen.”

Well,
I
can’t
say
the
notion
isn’t
tempting.
“This
is
madness,
Cersei.
Stannis
will
be
here
in
days.
You
need
me.”

“For
what?
Your
great
prowess
in
battle?”

“Bronn’s
sellswords
will
never
fight
without
me,”
he
lied.

“Oh,
I
think
they
will.
It’s
your
gold
they
love,
not
your
impish
wit.
Have
no
fear,
though,
they
won’t
be
without
you.
I
won’t
say
I
haven’t
thought
of
slitting
your
throat
from
time
to
time,
but
Jaime
would
never
forgive
me
if
I
did.”

“And
the
whore?”
He
would
not
call
her
by
name.
If
I
can
convince
her
Shae
means
nothing
to
me,
perhaps…

“She’ll
be
treated
gently
enough,
so
long
as
no
harm
comes
to
my
sons.
If
Joff
should
be
killed,
however,
or
if
Tommen
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies,
your
little
cunt
will
die
more
painfully
than
you
can
possibly
imagine.”

She
truly
believes
I
mean
to
kill
my
own
nephew.
“The
boys
are
safe,”
he
promised
her
wearily.
“Gods
be
good,
Cersei,
they’re
my
own
blood!
What
sort
of
man
do
you
take
me
for?”

“A
small
and
twisted
one.”

Tyrion
stared
at
the
dregs
on
the
bottom
of
his
wine
cup.
What
would
Jaime
do
in
my
place?
Kill
the
bitch,
most
likely,
and
worry
about
the
consequences
afterward.
But
Tyrion
did
not
have
a
golden
sword,
nor
the
skill
to
wield
one.
He
loved
his
brother’s
reckless
wrath,
but
it
was
their
lord
father
he
must
try
and
emulate.
Stone,
I
must
be
stone,
I
must
be
Casterly
Rock,
hard
and
unmovable.
If
I
fail
this
test,
I
had
as
lief
seek
out
the
nearest
grotesquerie.
“For
all
I
know,
you’ve
killed
her
already,”
he
said.

“Would
you
like
to
see
her?
I
thought
you
might.”
Cersei
crossed
the
room
and
threw
open
the
heavy
oaken
door.
“Bring
in
my
brother’s
whore.”

Ser
Osmund’s
brothers
Osney
and
Osfryd
were
peas
from
the
same
pod,
tall
men
with
hooked
noses,
dark
hair,
and
cruel
smiles.
She
hung
between
them,
eyes
wide
and
white
in
her
dark
face.
Blood
trickled
from
her
broken
lip,
and
he
could
see
bruises
through
her
torn
clothing.
Her
hands
were
bound
with
rope,
and
they’d
gagged
her
so
she
could
not
speak.

“You
said
she
wouldn’t
be
hurt.”

“She
fought.”
Unlike
his
brothers,
Osney
Kettleblack
was
clean-shaven,
so
the
scratches
showed
plainly
on
his
bare
cheeks.
“Got
claws
like
a
shadowcat,
this
one.”

“Bruises
heal,”
said
Cersei
in
a
bored
tone.
“The
whore
will
live.
So
long
as
Joff
does.”

Tyrion
wanted
to
laugh
at
her.
It
would
have
been
so
sweet,
so
very
very
sweet,
but
it
would
have
given
the
game
away.
You’ve
lost,
Cersei,
and
the
Kettleblacks
are
even
bigger
fools
than
Bronn
claimed.
All
he
needed
to
do
was
say
the
words.

Instead
he
looked
at
the
girl’s
face
and
said,
“You
swear
you’ll
release
her
after
the
battle?”

“If
you
release
Tommen,
yes.”

He
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
“Keep
her
then,
but
keep
her
safe.
If
these
animals
think
they
can
use
her…
well,
sweet
sister,
let
me
point
out
that
a
scale
tips
two
ways.”
His
tone
was
calm,
flat,
uncaring;
he’d
reached
for
his
father’s
voice,
and
found
it.
“Whatever
happens
to
her
happens
to
Tommen
as
well,
and
that
includes
the
beatings
and
rapes.”
If
she
thinks
me
such
a
monster,
I’ll
play
the
part
for
her.

Cersei
had
not
expected
that.
“You
would
not
dare.”

Tyrion
made
himself
smile,
slow
and
cold.
Green
and
black,
his
eyes
laughed
at
her.
“Dare?
I’ll
do
it
myself.”

His
sister’s
hand
flashed
at
his
face,
but
he
caught
her
wrist
and
bent
it
back
until
she
cried
out.
Osfryd
moved
to
her
rescue.
“One
more
step
and
I’ll
break
her
arm,”
the
dwarf
warned
him.
The
man
stopped.
“You
remember
when
I
said
you’d
never
hit
me
again,
Cersei?”
He
shoved
her
to
the
floor
and
turned
back
to
the
Kettleblacks.
“Untie
her
and
remove
that
gag.”

The
rope
had
been
so
tight
as
to
cut
off
the
blood
to
her
hands.
She
cried
out
in
pain
as
the
circulation
returned.
Tyrion
massaged
her
fingers
gently
until
feeling
returned.
“Sweetling,”
he
said,
“you
must
be
brave.
I
am
sorry
they
hurt
you.”

“I
know
you’ll
free
me,
my
lord.”

“I
will,”
he
promised,
and
Alayaya
bent
over
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow.
Her
broken
lips
left
a
smear
of
blood
on
his
forehead.
A
bloody
kiss
is
more
than
I
deserve,
Tyrion
thought.
She
would
never
have
been
hurt
but
for
me.

Her
blood
still
marked
him
as
he
looked
down
at
the
queen.
“I
have
never
liked
you,
Cersei,
but
you
were
my
own
sister,
so
I
never
did
you
harm.
You’ve
ended
that.
I
will
hurt
you
for
this.
I
don’t
know
how
yet,
but
give
me
time.
A
day
will
come
when
you
think
yourself
safe
and
happy,
and
suddenly
your
joy
will
turn
to
ashes
in
your
mouth,
and
you’ll
know
the
debt
is
paid.”
In
war,
his
father
had
told
him
once,
the
battle
is
over
in
the
instant
one
army
breaks
and
flees.
No
matter
that
they’re
as
numerous
as
they
were
a
moment
before,
still
armed
and
armored;
once
they
had
run
before
you
they
would
not
turn
to
fight
again.
So
it
was
with
Cersei.
“Get
out!”
was
all
the
answer
she
could
summon.
“Get
out
of
my
sight!”

Tyrion
bowed.
“Good
night,
then.
And
pleasant
dreams.”

He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
with
a
thousand
armored
feet
marching
through
his
skull.
I
ought
to
have
seen
this
coming
the
first
time
I
slipped
through
the
back
of
Chataya’s
wardrobe.
Perhaps
he
had
not
wanted
to
see.
His
legs
were
aching
badly
by
the
time
he
had
made
the
climb.
He
sent
Pod
for
a
flagon
of
wine
and
pushed
his
way
into
his
bedchamber.

Shae
sat
cross-legged
in
the
canopied
bed,
nude
but
for
the
heavy
golden
chain
that
looped
across
the
swell
of
her
breasts:
a
chain
of
linked
golden
hands,
each
clasping
the
next.

Tyrion
had
not
expected
her.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”

Laughing,
she
stroked
the
chain.
“I
wanted
some
hands
on
my
titties…
but
these
little
gold
ones
are
cold.”

For
a
moment
he
did
know
what
to
say.
How
could
he
tell
her
that
another
woman
had
taken
the
beating
meant
for
her,
and
might
well
die
in
her
place
should
some
mischance
of
battle
fell
Joffrey?
He
wiped
Alayaya’s
blood
from
his
brow
with
the
heel
of
his
hand.
“The
Lady
Lollys—”

“She’s
asleep.
Sleep’s
all
she
ever
wants
to
do,
the
great
cow.
She
sleeps
and
she
eats.
Sometimes
she
falls
asleep
while
she’s
eating.
The
food
falls
under
the
blankets
and
she
rolls
in
it,
and
I
have
to
clean
her.”
She
made
a
disgusted
face.
“All
they
did
was
fuck
her.”

“Her
mother
says
she’s
sick.”

“She
has
a
baby
in
her
belly,
that’s
all.”

Tyrion
gazed
around
the
room.
Everything
seemed
much
as
he
left
it.
“How
did
you
enter?
Show
me
the
hidden
door.”

She
gave
a
shrug.
“Lord
Varys
made
me
wear
a
hood.
I
couldn’t
see,
except…
there
was
one
place,
I
got
a
peep
at
the
floor
out
the
bottom
of
the
hood.
It
was
all
tiles,
you
know,
the
kind
that
make
a
picture?”

“A
mosaic?”

Shae
nodded.
“They
were
colored
red
and
black.
I
think
the
picture
was
a
dragon.
Otherwise,
everything
was
dark.
We
went
down
a
ladder
and
walked
a
long
ways,
until
I
was
all
twisted
around.
Once
we
stopped
so
he
could
unlock
an
iron
gate.
I
brushed
against
it
when
we
went
through.
The
dragon
was
past
the
gate.
Then
we
went
up
another
ladder,
with
a
tunnel
at
the
top.
I
had
to
stoop,
and
I
think
Lord
Varys
was
crawling.”

Tyrion
made
a
round
of
the
bedchamber.
One
of
the
sconces
looked
loose.
He
stood
on
his
toes
and
tried
to
turn
it.
It
revolved
slowly,
scraping
against
the
stone
wall.
When
it
was
upside
down,
the
stub
of
the
candle
fell
out.
The
rushes
scattered
across
the
cold
stone
floor
did
not
show
any
particular
disturbance.
“Doesn’t
m’lord
want
to
bed
me?”
asked
Shae.

“In
a
moment.”
Tyrion
threw
open
his
wardrobe,
shoved
the
clothing
aside,
and
pushed
against
the
rear
panel.
What
worked
for
a
whorehouse
might
work
for
a
castle
as
well…
but
no,
the
wood
was
solid,
unyielding.
A
stone
beside
the
window
seat
drew
his
eye,
but
all
his
tugging
and
prodding
went
for
naught.
He
returned
to
the
bed
frustrated
and
annoyed.

Shae
undid
his
laces
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck.
“Your
shoulders
feel
as
hard
as
rocks,”
she
murmured.
“Hurry,
I
want
to
feel
you
inside
me.”
Yet
as
her
legs
locked
around
his
waist,
his
manhood
left
him.
When
she
felt
him
go
soft,
Shae
slid
down
under
the
sheets
and
took
him
in
her
mouth,
but
even
that
could
not
rouse
him.

After
a
few
moments
he
stopped
her.
“What’s
wrong?”
she
asked.
All
the
sweet
innocence
of
the
world
was
written
there
in
the
lines
of
her
young
face.

Innocence?
Fool,
she’s
a
whore,
Cersei
was
right,
you
think
with
your
cock,
fool,
fool.

“Just
go
to
sleep,
sweetling,”
he
urged,
stroking
her
hair.
Yet
long
after
Shae
had
taken
his
advice,
Tyrion
himself
still
lay
awake,
his
fingers
cupped
over
one
small
breast
as
he
listened
to
her
breathing.





CATELYN

The
Great
Hall
of
Riverrun
was
a
lonely
place
for
two
to
sit
to
supper.
Deep
shadows
draped
the
walls.
One
of
the
torches
had
guttered
out,
leaving
only
three.
Catelyn
sat
staring
into
her
wine
goblet.
The
vintage
tasted
thin
and
sour
on
her
tongue.
Brienne
was
across
from
her.
Between
them,
her
father’s
high
seat
was
as
empty
as
the
rest
of
the
hall.
Even
the
servants
were
gone.
She
had
given
them
leave
to
join
the
celebration.

The
walls
of
the
keep
were
thick,
yet
even
so,
they
could
hear
the
muffled
sounds
of
revelry
from
the
yard
outside.
Ser
Desmond
had
brought
twenty
casks
up
from
the
cellars,
and
the
smallfolk
were
celebrating
Edmure’s
imminent
return
and
Robb’s
conquest
of
the
Crag
by
hoisting
horns
of
nut-brown
ale.

I
cannot
blame
them,
Catelyn
thought.
They
do
not
know.
And
if
they
did,
why
should
they
care?
They
never
knew
my
sons.
Never
watched
Bran
climb
with
their
hearts
in
their
throats,
pride
and
terror
so
mingled
they
seemed
as
one,
never
heard
him
laugh,
never
smiled
to
see
Rickon
trying
so
fiercely
to
be
like
his
older
brothers.
She
stared
at
the
supper
set
before
her:
trout
wrapped
in
bacon,
salad
of
turnip
greens
and
red
fennel
and
sweetgrass,
pease
and
onions
and
hot
bread.
Brienne
was
eating
methodically,
as
if
supper
were
another
chore
to
be
accomplished.
I
am
become
a
sour
woman,
Catelyn
thought.
I
take
no
joy
in
mead
nor
meat,
and
song
and
laughter
have
become
suspicious
strangers
to
me.
I
am
a
creature
of
grief
and
dust
and
bitter
longings.
There
is
an
empty
place
within
me
where
my
heart
was
once.

The
sound
of
the
other
woman’s
eating
had
become
intolerable
to
her.
“Brienne,
I
am
no
fit
company.
Go
join
the
revels,
if
you
would.
Drink
a
horn
of
ale
and
dance
to
Rymund’s
harping.”

“I
am
not
made
for
revels,
my
lady.”
Her
big
hands
tore
apart
a
heel
of
black
bread.
Brienne
stared
at
the
chunks
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
they
were.
“If
you
command
it,
I…”

Catelyn
could
sense
her
discomfort.
“I
only
thought
you
might
enjoy
happier
company
than
mine.”

“I’m
well
content.”
The
girl
used
the
bread
to
sop
up
some
of
the
bacon
grease
the
trout
had
been
fried
in.

“There
was
another
bird
this
morning.”
Catelyn
did
not
know
why
she
said
it.
“The
maester
woke
me
at
once.
That
was
dutiful,
but
not
kind.
Not
kind
at
all.”
She
had
not
meant
to
tell
Brienne.
No
one
knew
but
her
and
Maester
Vyman,
and
she
had
meant
to
keep
it
that
way
until…
until…

Until
what?
Foolish
woman,
will
holding
it
secret
in
your
heart
make
it
any
less
true?
If
you
never
tell,
never
speak
of
it,
will
it
become
only
a
dream,
less
than
a
dream,
a
nightmare
half-remembered?
Oh,
if
only
the
gods
would
be
so
good.

“Is
it
news
of
King’s
Landing?”
asked
Brienne.

“Would
that
it
was.
The
bird
came
from
Castle
Cerwyn,
from
Ser
Rodrik,
my
castellan.”
Dark
wings,
dark
words.
“He
has
gathered
what
power
he
could
and
is
marching
on
Winterfell,
to
take
the
castle
back.”
How
unimportant
all
that
sounded
now.
“But
he
said…
he
wrote…
he
told
me,
he…”

“My
lady,
what
is
it?
Is
it
some
news
of
your
sons?”

Such
a
simple
question
that
was;
would
that
the
answer
could
be
as
simple.
When
Catelyn
tried
to
speak,
the
words
caught
in
her
throat.
“I
have
no
sons
but
Robb.”
She
managed
those
terrible
words
without
a
sob,
and
for
that
much
she
was
glad.

Brienne
looked
at
her
with
horror.
“My
lady?”

“Bran
and
Rickon
tried
to
escape,
but
were
taken
at
a
mill
on
the
Acorn
Water.
Theon
Greyjoy
has
mounted
their
heads
on
the
walls
of
Winterfell.
Theon
Greyjoy,
who
ate
at
my
table
since
he
was
a
boy
of
ten.”
I
have
said
it,
gods
forgive
me.
I
have
said
it
and
made
it
true.

Brienne’s
face
was
a
watery
blur.
She
reached
across
the
table,
but
her
fingers
stopped
short
of
Catelyn’s,
as
if
the
touch
might
be
unwelcome.
“I…
there
are
no
words,
my
lady.
My
good
lady.
Your
sons,
they…
they’re
with
the
gods
now.”

“Are
they?”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“What
god
would
let
this
happen?
Rickon
was
only
a
baby.
How
could
he
deserve
such
a
death?
And
Bran…
when
I
left
the
north,
he
had
not
opened
his
eyes
since
his
fall.
I
had
to
go
before
he
woke.
Now
I
can
never
return
to
him,
or
hear
him
laugh
again.”
She
showed
Brienne
her
palms,
her
fingers.
“These
scars…
they
sent
a
man
to
cut
Bran’s
throat
as
he
lay
sleeping.
He
would
have
died
then,
and
me
with
him,
but
Bran’s
wolf
tore
out
the
man’s
throat.”
That
gave
her
a
moment’s
pause.
“I
suppose
Theon
killed
the
wolves
too.
He
must
have,
elsewise…
I
was
certain
the
boys
would
be
safe
so
long
as
the
direwolves
were
with
them.
Like
Robb
with
his
Grey
Wind.
But
my
daughters
have
no
wolves
now.”

The
abrupt
shift
of
topic
left
Brienne
bewildered.
“Your
daughters…”

“Sansa
was
a
lady
at
three,
always
so
courteous
and
eager
to
please.
She
loved
nothing
so
well
as
tales
of
knightly
valor.
Men
would
say
she
had
my
look,
but
she
will
grow
into
a
woman
far
more
beautiful
than
I
ever
was,
you
can
see
that.
I
often
sent
away
her
maid
so
I
could
brush
her
hair
myself.
She
had
auburn
hair,
lighter
than
mine,
and
so
thick
and
soft…
the
red
in
it
would
catch
the
light
of
the
torches
and
shine
like
copper.

“And
Arya,
well…
Ned’s
visitors
would
oft
mistake
her
for
a
stableboy
if
they
rode
into
the
yard
unannounced.
Arya
was
a
trial,
it
must
be
said.
Half
a
boy
and
half
a
wolf
pup.
Forbid
her
anything
and
it
became
her
heart’s
desire.
She
had
Ned’s
long
face,
and
brown
hair
that
always
looked
as
though
a
bird
had
been
nesting
in
it.
I
despaired
of
ever
making
a
lady
of
her.
She
collected
scabs
as
other
girls
collect
dolls,
and
would
say
anything
that
came
into
her
head.
I
think
she
must
be
dead
too.”
When
she
said
that,
it
felt
as
though
a
giant
hand
were
squeezing
her
chest.
“I
want
them
all
dead,
Brienne.
Theon
Greyjoy
first,
then
Jaime
Lannister
and
Cersei
and
the
Imp,
every
one,
every
one.
But
my
girls…
my
girls
will…”

“The
queen…
she
has
a
little
girl
of
her
own,”
Brienne
said
awkwardly.
“And
sons
too,
of
an
age
with
yours.
When
she
hears,
perhaps
she…
she
may
take
pity,
and…”

“Send
my
daughters
back
unharmed?”
Catelyn
smiled
sadly.
“There
is
a
sweet
innocence
about
you,
child.
I
could
wish…
but
no.
Robb
will
avenge
his
brothers.
Ice
can
kill
as
dead
as
fire.
Ice
was
Ned’s
greatsword.
Valyrian
steel,
marked
with
the
ripples
of
a
thousand
foldings,
so
sharp
I
feared
to
touch
it.
Robb’s
blade
is
dull
as
a
cudgel
compared
to
Ice.
It
will
not
be
easy
for
him
to
get
Theon’s
head
off,
I
fear.
The
Starks
do
not
use
headsmen.
Ned
always
said
that
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
blade,
though
he
never
took
any
joy
in
the
duty.
But
I
would,
oh,
yes.”
She
stared
at
her
scarred
hands,
opened
and
closed
them,
then
slowly
raised
her
eyes.
“I’ve
sent
him
wine.”

“Wine?”
Brienne
was
lost.
“Robb?
Or…
Theon
Greyjoy?”

“The
Kingslayer.”
The
ploy
had
served
her
well
with
Cleos
Frey.
I
hope
you’re
thirsty,
Jaime.
I
hope
your
throat
is
dry
and
tight.
“I
would
like
you
to
come
with
me.”

“I
am
yours
to
command,
my
lady.”

“Good.”
Catelyn
rose
abruptly.
“Stay,
finish
your
meal
in
peace.
I
will
send
for
you
later.
At
midnight.”

“So
late,
my
lady?”

“The
dungeons
are
windowless.
One
hour
is
much
like
another
down
there,
and
for
me,
all
hours
are
midnight.”
Her
footsteps
rang
hollowly
when
Catelyn
left
the
hall.
As
she
climbed
to
Lord
Hoster’s
solar,
she
could
hear
them
outside,
shouting,
“Tully!”
and
“A
cup!
A
cup
to
the
brave
young
lord!”
My
father
is
not
dead,
she
wanted
to
shout
down
at
them.
My
sons
are
dead,
but
my
father
lives,
damn
you
all,
and
he
is
your
lord
still.

Lord
Hoster
was
deep
in
sleep.
“He
had
a
cup
of
drearnwine
not
so
long
ago,
my
lady,”
Maester
Vyman
said.
“For
the
pain.
He
will
not
know
you
are
here.”

“It
makes
no
matter,”
Catelyn
said.
He
is
more
dead
than
alive,
yet
more
alive
than
my
poor
sweet
sons.

“My
lady,
is
there
aught
I
might
do
for
you?
A
sleeping
draught,
perhaps?”

“Thank
you,
Maester,
but
no.
I
will
not
sleep
away
my
grief.
Bran
and
Rickon
deserve
better
from
me.
Go
and
join
the
celebration,
I
will
sit
with
my
father
for
a
time.”

“As
you
will,
my
lady.”
Vyman
bowed
and
left
her.

Lord
Hoster
lay
on
his
back,
mouth
open,
his
breath
a
faint
whistling
sigh.
One
hand
hung
over
the
edge
of
the
mattress,
a
pale
frail
fleshless
thing,
but
warm
when
she
touched
it.
She
slid
her
fingers
through
his
and
closed
them.
No
matter
how
tightly
I
hold
him,
I
cannot
keep
him
here,
she
thought
sadly.
Let
him
go.
Yet
her
fingers
would
not
seem
to
unbend.

“I
have
no
one
to
talk
with,
Father,”
she
told
him.
“I
pray,
but
the
gods
do
not
answer.”
Lightly
she
kissed
his
hand.
The
skin
was
warm,
blue
veins
branching
like
rivers
beneath
his
pale
translucent
skin.
Outside
the
greater
rivers
flowed,
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone,
and
they
would
flow
forever,
but
not
so
the
rivers
in
her
father’s
hand.
Too
soon
that
current
would
grow
still.
“Last
night
I
dreamed
of
that
time
Lysa
and
I
got
lost
while
riding
back
from
Seagard.
Do
you
remember?
That
strange
fog
came
up
and
we
fell
behind
the
rest
of
the
party.
Everything
was
grey,
and
I
could
not
see
a
foot
past
the
nose
of
my
horse.
We
lost
the
road.
The
branches
of
the
trees
were
like
long
skinny
arms
reaching
out
to
grab
us
as
we
passed.
Lysa
started
to
cry,
and
when
I
shouted
the
fog
seemed
to
swallow
the
sound.
But
Petyr
knew
where
we
were,
and
he
rode
back
and
found
us…

“But
there’s
no
one
to
find
me
now,
is
there?
This
time
I
have
to
find
our
own
way,
and
it
is
hard,
so
hard.

“I
keep
remembering
the
Stark
words.
Winter
has
come,
Father.
For
me.
For
me.
Robb
must
fight
the
Greyjoys
now
as
well
as
the
Lannisters,
and
for
what?
For
a
gold
hat
and
an
iron
chair?
Surely
the
land
has
bled
enough.
I
want
my
girls
back,
I
want
Robb
to
lay
down
his
sword
and
pick
some
homely
daughter
of
Walder
Frey
to
make
him
happy
and
give
him
sons.
I
want
Bran
and
Rickon
back,
I
want…”
Catelyn
hung
her
head.
“I
want,”
she
said
once
more,
and
then
her
words
were
gone.

After
a
time
the
candle
guttered
and
went
out.
Moonlight
slanted
between
the
slats
of
the
shutters,
laying
pale
silvery
bars
across
her
father’s
face.
She
could
hear
the
soft
whisper
of
his
labored
breathing,
the
endless
rush
of
waters,
the
faint
chords
of
some
love
song
drifting
up
from
the
yard,
so
sad
and
sweet.
“I
loved
a
maid
as
red
as
autumn,”
Rymund
sang,
“with
sunset
in
her
hair.”

Catelyn
never
noticed
when
the
singing
ended.
Hours
had
passed,
yet
it
seemed
only
a
heartbeat
before
Brienne
was
at
the
door.
“My
lady,”
she
announced
softly.
“Midnight
has
come.”

Midnight
has
come,
Father,
she
thought,
and
I
must
do
my
duty.
She
let
go
of
his
hand.
=======
“Ser
Addam
bid
me
tell
you
that
the
Stark
host
is
moving
down
the
causeway.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
did
not
smile.
Lord
Tywin
never
smiled,
but
Tyrion
had
learned
to
read
his
father’s
pleasure
all
the
same,
and
it
was
there
on
his
face.
“So
the
wolfling
is
leaving
his
den
to
play
among
the
lions,”
he
said
in
a
voice
of
quiet
satisfaction.
“Splendid.
Return
to
Ser
Addam
and
tell
him
to
fall
back.
He
is
not
to
engage
the
northerners
until
we
arrive,
but
I
want
him
to
harass
their
flanks
and
draw
them
farther
south.”

“It
will
be
as
you
command.”
The
rider
took
his
leave.

“We
are
well
situated
here,”
Ser
Kevan
pointed
out.
“Close
to
the
ford
and
ringed
by
pits
and
spikes.
If
they
are
coming
south,
I
say
let
them
come,
and
break
themselves
against
us.”

“The
boy
may
hang
back
or
lose
his
courage
when
he
sees
our
numbers,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“The
sooner
the
Starks
are
broken,
the
sooner
I
shall
be
free
to
deal
with
Stannis
Baratheon.
Tell
the
drummers
to
beat
assembly,
and
send
word
to
Jaime
that
I
am
marching
against
Robb
Stark.”

“As
you
will,”
Ser
Kevan
said.

Tyrion
watched
with
a
grim
fascination
as
his
lord
father
turned
next
to
the
half-wild
clansmen.
“It
is
said
that
the
men
of
the
mountain
clans
are
warriors
without
fear.”

“It
is
said
truly,”
Conn
of
the
Stone
Crows
answered.

“And
the
women,”
Chella
added.

“Ride
with
me
against
my
enemies,
and
you
shall
have
all
my
son
promised
you,
and
more,”
Lord
Tywin
told
them.

“Would
you
pay
us
with
our
own
coin?”
Ulf
son
of
Umar
said.
“Why
should
we
need
the
father’s
promise,
when
we
have
the
son’s?”

“I
said
nothing
of
need,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“My
words
were
courtesy,
nothing
more.
You
need
not
join
us.
The
men
of
the
winterlands
are
made
of
iron
and
ice,
and
even
my
boldest
knights
fear
to
face
them.”

Oh,
deftly
done,
Tyrion
thought,
smiling
crookedly.

“The
Burned
Men
fear
nothing.
Timett
son
of
Timett
will
ride
with
the
lions.”

“Wherever
the
Burned
Men
go,
the
Stone
Crows
have
been
there
first,”
Conn
declared
hotly.
“We
ride
as
well.”

“Shagga
son
of
Dolf
will
chop
off
their
manhoods
and
feed
them
to
the
crows.”

“We
will
ride
with
you,
lion
lord,”
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
agreed,
“but
only
if
your
halfman
son
goes
with
us.
He
has
bought
his
breath
with
promises.
Until
we
hold
the
steel
he
has
pledged
us,
his
life
is
ours.”

Lord
Tywin
turned
his
gold-flecked
eyes
on
his
son.

“Joy,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
resigned
smile.





SANSA

The
walls
of
the
throne
room
had
been
stripped
bare,
the
hunting
tapestries
that
King
Robert
loved
taken
down
and
stacked
in
the
corner
in
an
untidy
heap.

Ser
Mandon
Moore
went
to
take
his
place
under
the
throne
beside
two
of
his
fellows
of
the
Kingsguard.
Sansa
hovered
by
the
door,
for
once
unguarded.
The
queen
had
given
her
freedom
of
the
castle
as
a
reward
for
being
good,
yet
even
so,
she
was
escorted
everywhere
she
went.
“Honor
guards
for
my
daughter-to-be,”
the
queen
called
them,
but
they
did
not
make
Sansa
feel
honored.

“Freedom
of
the
castle”
meant
that
she
could
go
wherever
she
chose
within
the
Red
Keep
so
long
as
she
promised
not
to
go
beyond
the
walls,
a
promise
Sansa
had
been
more
than
willing
to
give.
She
couldn’t
have
gone
beyond
the
walls
anyway.
The
gates
were
watched
day
and
night
by
Janos
Slynt’s
gold
cloaks,
and
Lannister
house
guards
were
always
about
as
well.
Besides,
even
if
she
could
leave
the
castle,
where
would
she
go?
It
was
enough
that
she
could
walk
in
the
yard,
pick
flowers
in
Myrcella’s
garden,
and
visit
the
sept
to
pray
for
her
father.
Sometimes
she
prayed
in
the
godswood
as
well,
since
the
Starks
kept
the
old
gods.

This
was
the
first
court
session
of
Joffrey’s
reign,
so
Sansa
looked
about
nervously.
A
line
of
Lannister
house
guards
stood
beneath
the
western
windows,
a
line
of
gold-cloaked
City
Watchmen
beneath
the
east.
Of
smallfolk
and
commoners,
she
saw
no
sign,
but
under
the
gallery
a
cluster
of
lords
great
and
small
milled
restlessly.
There
were
no
more
than
twenty,
where
a
hundred
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
upon
King
Robert.

Sansa
slipped
in
among
them,
murmuring
greetings
as
she
worked
her
way
toward
the
front.
She
recognized
black-skinned
Jalabhar
Xho,
gloomy
Ser
Aron
Santagar,
the
Redwyne
twins
Horror
and
Slobber…
only
none
of
them
seemed
to
recognize
her.
Or
if
they
did,
they
shied
away
as
if
she
had
the
grey
plague.
Sickly
Lord
Gyles
covered
his
face
at
her
approach
and
feigned
a
fit
of
coughing,
and
when
funny
drunken
Ser
Dontos
started
to
hail
her,
Ser
Balon
Swann
whispered
in
his
ear
and
he
turned
away.

And
so
many
others
were
missing.
Where
had
the
rest
of
them
gone?
Sansa
wondered.
Vainly,
she
searched
for
friendly
faces.
Not
one
of
them
would
meet
her
eyes.
It
was
as
if
she
had
become
a
ghost,
dead
before
her
time.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
seated
alone
at
the
council
table,
seemingly
asleep,
his
hands
clasped
together
atop
his
beard.
She
saw
Lord
Varys
hurry
into
the
hall,
his
feet
making
no
sound.
A
moment
later
Lord
Baelish
entered
through
the
tall
doors
in
the
rear,
smiling.
He
chatted
amiably
with
Ser
Balon
and
Ser
Dontos
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
front.
Butterflies
fluttered
nervously
in
Sansa’s
stomach.
I
shouldn’t
be
afraid,
she
told
herself.
I
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of,
it
will
all
come
out
well,
Joff
loves
me
and
the
queen
does
too,
she
said
so.

A
herald’s
voice
rang
out.
“All
hail
His
Grace,
Joffrey
of
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
All
hail
his
lady
mother,
Cersei
of
House
Lannister,
Queen
Regent,
Light
of
the
West,
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
resplendent
in
white
plate,
led
them
in.
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
escorted
the
queen,
while
Ser
Boros
Blount
walked
beside
Joffrey,
so
six
of
the
Kingsguard
were
now
in
the
hall,
all
the
White
Swords
save
Jaime
Lannister
alone.
Her
prince—no,
her
king
now!—took
the
steps
of
the
Iron
Throne
two
at
a
time,
while
his
mother
was
seated
with
the
council.
Joff
wore
plush
black
velvets
slashed
with
crimson,
a
shimmering
cloth-of-gold
cape
with
a
high
collar,
and
on
his
head
a
golden
crown
crusted
with
rubies
and
black
diamonds.

When
Joffrey
turned
to
look
out
over
the
hall,
his
eye
caught
Sansa’s.
He
smiled,
seated
himself,
and
spoke.
“It
is
a
king’s
duty
to
punish
the
disloyal
and
reward
those
who
are
true.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
I
command
you
to
read
my
decrees.”

Pycelle
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
clad
in
a
magnificent
robe
of
thick
red
velvet,
with
an
ermine
collar
and
shiny
gold
fastenings.
From
a
drooping
sleeve,
heavy
with
gilded
scrollwork,
he
drew
a
parchment,
unrolled
it,
and
began
to
read
a
long
list
of
names,
commanding
each
in
the
name
of
king
and
council
to
present
themselves
and
swear
their
fealty
to
Joffrey.
Failing
that,
they
would
be
adjudged
traitors,
their
lands
and
titles
forfeit
to
the
throne.

The
names
he
read
made
Sansa
hold
her
breath.
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon,
his
lady
wife,
his
daughter.
Lord
Renly
Baratheon.
Both
Lord
Royces
and
their
sons.
Ser
Loras
Tyrell.
Lord
Mace
Tyrell,
his
brothers,
uncles,
sons.
The
red
priest,
Thoros
of
Myr.
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion.
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son,
the
little
Lord
Robert.
Lord
Hoster
Tully,
his
brother
Ser
Brynden,
his
son
Ser
Edmure.
Lord
Jason
Mallister.
Lord
Bryce
Caron
of
the
Marches.
Lord
Tytos
Blackwood.
Lord
Walder
Frey
and
his
heir
Ser
Stevron.
Lord
Karyl
Vance.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken.
Lady
Sheila
Whent.
Doran
Martell,
Prince
of
Dorne,
and
all
his
sons.
So
many,
she
thought
as
Pycelle
read
on
and
on,
it
will
take
a
whole
flock
of
ravens
to
send
out
these
commands.

And
at
the
end,
near
last,
came
the
names
Sansa
had
been
dreading.
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.
Robb
Stark.
Brandon
Stark,
Rickon
Stark,
Arya
Stark.
Sansa
stifled
a
gasp.
Arya.
They
wanted
Arya
to
present
herself
and
swear
an
oath…
it
must
mean
her
sister
had
fled
on
the
galley,
she
must
be
safe
at
Winterfell
by
now…

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
rolled
up
the
list,
tucked
it
up
his
left
sleeve,
and
pulled
another
parchment
from
his
right.
He
cleared
his
throat
and
resumed.
“In
the
place
of
the
traitor
Eddard
Stark,
it
is
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
Tywin
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Warden
of
the
West,
take
up
the
office
of
Hand
of
the
King,
to
speak
with
his
voice,
lead
his
armies
against
his
enemies,
and
carry
out
his
royal
will.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.

“In
the
place
of
the
traitor
Stannis
Baratheon,
it
is
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
his
lady
mother,
the
Queen
Regent
Cersei
Lannister,
who
has
ever
been
his
staunchest
support,
be
seated
upon
his
small
council,
that
she
may
help
him
rule
wisely
and
with
justice.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.”

Sansa
heard
a
soft
murmuring
from
the
lords
around
her,
but
it
was
quickly
stilled.
Pycelle
continued.

“It
is
also
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
his
loyal
servant,
Janos
Slynt,
Commander
of
the
City
Watch
of
King’s
Landing,
be
at
once
raised
to
the
rank
of
lord
and
granted
the
ancient
seat
of
Harrenhal
with
all
its
attendant
lands
and
incomes,
and
that
his
sons
and
grandsons
shall
hold
these
honors
after
him
until
the
end
of
time.
It
is
moreover
his
command
that
Lord
Slynt
be
seated
immediately
upon
his
small
council,
to
assist
in
the
governance
of
the
realm.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.”

Sansa
glimpsed
motion
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
as
Janos
Slynt
made
his
entrance.
This
time
the
muttering
was
louder
and
angrier.
Proud
lords
whose
houses
went
back
thousands
of
years
made
way
reluctantly
for
the
balding,
frog-faced
commoner
as
he
marched
past.
Golden
scales
had
been
sewn
onto
the
black
velvet
of
his
doublet
and
rang
together
softly
with
each
step.
His
cloak
was
checked
black-and-gold
satin.
Two
ugly
boys
who
must
have
been
his
sons
went
before
him,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
a
heavy
metal
shield
as
tall
as
they
were.
For
his
sigil
he
had
taken
a
bloody
spear,
gold
on
a
night-black
field.
The
sight
of
it
raised
goose
prickles
up
and
down
Sansa’s
arms.

As
Lord
Slynt
took
his
place,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
resumed.
“Lastly,
in
these
times
of
treason
and
turmoil,
with
our
beloved
Robert
so
lately
dead,
it
is
the
view
of
the
council
that
the
life
and
safety
of
King
Joffrey
is
of
paramount
importance…”
He
looked
to
the
queen.

Cersei
stood.
“Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
stand
forth.”

Ser
Barristan
had
been
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne,
as
still
as
any
statue,
but
now
he
went
to
one
knee
and
bowed
his
head.
“Your
Grace,
I
am
yours
to
command.”

“Rise,
Ser
Barristan,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
“You
may
remove
your
helm.”

“My
lady?”
Standing,
the
old
knight
took
off
his
high
white
helm,
though
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
why.

“You
have
served
the
realm
long
and
faithfully,
good
ser,
and
every
man
and
woman
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
owes
you
thanks.
Yet
now
I
fear
your
service
is
at
an
end.
It
is
the
wish
of
king
and
council
that
you
lay
down
your
heavy
burden.”

“My…
burden?
I
fear
I…
I
do
not…”

The
new-made
lord,
Janos
Slynt,
spoke
up,
his
voice
heavy
and
blunt.
“Her
Grace
is
trying
to
tell
you
that
you
are
relieved
as
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.”

The
tall,
white-haired
knight
seemed
to
shrink
as
he
stood
there,
scarcely
breathing.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said
at
last.
“The
Kingsguard
is
a
Sworn
Brotherhood.
Our
vows
are
taken
for
life.
Only
death
may
relieve
the
Lord
Commander
of
his
sacred
trust.”

“Whose
death,
Ser
Barristan?”
The
queen’s
voice
was
soft
as
silk,
but
her
words
carried
the
whole
length
of
the
hall.
“Yours,
or
your
king’s?”

“You
let
my
father
die,”
Joffrey
said
accusingly
from
atop
the
Iron
Throne.
“You’re
too
old
to
protect
anybody.”

Sansa
watched
as
the
knight
peered
up
at
his
new
king.
She
had
never
seen
him
look
his
years
before,
yet
now
he
did.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“I
was
chosen
for
the
White
Swords
in
my
twenty-third
year.
It
was
all
I
had
ever
dreamed,
from
the
moment
I
first
took
sword
in
hand.
I
gave
up
all
claim
to
my
ancestral
keep.
The
girl
I
was
to
wed
married
my
cousin
in
my
place,
I
had
no
need
of
land
or
sons,
my
life
would
be
lived
for
the
realm.
Ser
Gerold
Hightower
himself
heard
my
vows…
to
ward
the
king
with
all
my
strength…
to
give
my
blood
for
his…
I
fought
beside
the
White
Bull
and
Prince
Lewyn
of
Dorne…
beside
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
Before
I
served
your
father,
I
helped
shield
King
Aerys,
and
his
father
Jaehaerys
before
him…
three
kings…”

“And
all
of
them
dead,”
Littlefinger
pointed
out.

“Your
time
is
done,”
Cersei
Lannister
announced.
“Joffrey
requires
men
around
him
who
are
young
and
strong.
The
council
has
determined
that
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
will
take
your
place
as
the
Lord
Commander
of
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
White
Swords.”

“The
Kingslayer,”
Ser
Barristan
said,
his
voice
hard
with
contempt.
“The
false
knight
who
profaned
his
blade
with
the
blood
of
the
king
he
had
sworn
to
defend.”

“Have
a
care
for
your
words,
ser,”
the
queen
warned.
“You
are
speaking
of
our
beloved
brother,
your
king’s
own
blood.”

Lord
Varys
spoke,
gentler
than
the
others.
“We
are
not
unmindful
of
your
service,
good
ser.
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
has
generously
agreed
to
grant
you
a
handsome
tract
of
land
north
of
Lannisport,
beside
the
sea,
with
gold
and
men
sufficient
to
build
you
a
stout
keep,
and
servants
to
see
to
your
every
need.”

Ser
Barristan
looked
up
sharply.
“A
hall
to
die
in,
and
men
to
bury
me.
I
thank
you,
my
lords…
but
I
spit
upon
your
pity.”
He
reached
up
and
undid
the
clasps
that
held
his
cloak
in
place,
and
the
heavy
white
garment
slithered
from
his
shoulders
to
fall
in
a
heap
on
the
floor.
His
helmet
dropped
with
a
clang.
“I
am
a
knight,”
he
told
them.
He
opened
the
silver
fastenings
of
his
breastplate
and
let
that
fall
as
well.
“I
shall
die
a
knight.”

“A
naked
knight,
it
would
seem,”
quipped
Littlefinger.

They
all
laughed
then,
Joffrey
on
his
throne,
and
the
lords
standing
attendance,
Janos
Slynt
and
Queen
Cersei
and
Sandor
Clegane
and
even
the
other
men
of
the
Kingsguard,
the
five
who
had
been
his
brothers
until
a
moment
ago.
Surely
that
must
have
hurt
the
most,
Sansa
thought.
Her
heart
went
out
to
the
gallant
old
man
as
he
stood
shamed
and
red-faced,
too
angry
to
speak.
Finally
he
drew
his
sword.

Sansa
heard
someone
gasp.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
moved
forward
to
confront
him,
but
Ser
Barristan
froze
them
in
place
with
a
look
that
dripped
contempt.
“Have
no
fear,
sers,
your
king
is
safe…
no
thanks
to
you.
Even
now,
I
could
cut
through
the
five
of
you
as
easy
as
a
dagger
cuts
cheese.
If
you
would
serve
under
the
Kingslayer,
not
a
one
of
you
is
fit
to
wear
the
white.”
He
flung
his
sword
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne.
“Here,
boy.
Melt
it
down
and
add
it
to
the
others,
if
you
like.
It
will
do
you
more
good
than
the
swords
in
the
hands
of
these
five.
Perhaps
Lord
Stannis
will
chance
to
sit
on
it
when
he
takes
your
throne.”

He
took
the
long
way
out,
his
steps
ringing
loud
against
the
floor
and
echoing
off
the
bare
stone
walls.
Lords
and
ladies
parted
to
let
him
pass.
Not
until
the
pages
had
closed
the
great
oak-and-bronze
doors
behind
him
did
Sansa
hear
sounds
again:
soft
voices,
uneasy
stirrings,
the
shuffle
of
papers
from
the
council
table.
“He
called
me
boy,”
Joffrey
said
peevishly,
sounding
younger
than
his
years.
“He
talked
about
my
uncle
Stannis
too.”

“Idle
talk,”
said
Varys
the
eunuch.
“Without
meaning…”

“He
could
be
making
plots
with
my
uncles.
I
want
him
seized
and
questioned.”
No
one
moved.
Joffrey
raised
his
voice.
“I
said,
I
want
him
seized!”

Janos
Slynt
rose
from
the
council
table.
“My
gold
cloaks
will
see
to
it,
Your
Grace.”

“Good,”
said
King
Joffrey.
Lord
Janos
strode
from
the
hall,
his
ugly
sons
double-stepping
to
keep
up
as
they
lugged
the
great
metal
shield
with
the
arms
of
House
Slynt.

“Your
Grace,”
Littlefinger
reminded
the
king.
“If
we
might
resume,
the
seven
are
now
six.
We
find
ourselves
in
need
of
a
new
sword
for
your
Kingsguard.”

Joffrey
smiled.
“Tell
them,
Mother.”

“The
king
and
council
have
determined
that
no
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
more
fit
to
guard
and
protect
His
Grace
than
his
sworn
shield,
Sandor
Clegane.”

“How
do
you
like
that,
dog?”
King
Joffrey
asked.

The
Hound’s
scarred
face
was
hard
to
read.
He
took
a
long
moment
to
consider.
“Why
not?
I
have
no
lands
nor
wife
to
forsake,
and
who’d
care
if
I
did?”
The
burned
side
of
his
mouth
twisted.
“But
I
warn
you,
I’ll
say
no
knight’s
vows.”

“The
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
Kingsguard
have
always
been
knights,”
Ser
Boros
said
firmly.

“Until
now,”
the
Hound
said
in
his
deep
rasp,
and
Ser
Boros
fell
silent.

When
the
king’s
herald
moved
forward,
Sansa
realized
the
moment
was
almost
at
hand.
She
smoothed
down
the
cloth
of
her
skirt
nervously.
She
was
dressed
in
mourning,
as
a
sign
of
respect
for
the
dead
king,
but
she
had
taken
special
care
to
make
herself
beautiful.
Her
gown
was
the
ivory
silk
that
the
queen
had
given
her,
the
one
Arya
had
ruined,
but
she’d
had
them
dye
it
black
and
you
couldn’t
see
the
stain
at
all.
She
had
fretted
over
her
jewelry
for
hours
and
finally
decided
upon
the
elegant
simplicity
of
a
plain
silver
chain.

The
herald’s
voice
boomed
out.
“If
any
man
in
this
hall
has
other
matters
to
set
before
His
Grace,
let
him
speak
now
or
go
forth
and
hold
his
silence.”

Sansa
quailed.
Now,
she
told
herself,
I
must
do
it
now.
Gods
give
me
courage.
She
took
one
step,
then
another.
Lords
and
knights
stepped
aside
silently
to
let
her
pass,
and
she
felt
the
weight
of
their
eyes
on
her.
I
must
be
as
strong
as
my
lady
mother.
“Your
Grace,”
she
called
out
in
a
soft,
tremulous
voice.

The
height
of
the
Iron
Throne
gave
Joffrey
a
better
vantage
point
than
anyone
else
in
the
hall.
He
was
the
first
to
see
her.
“Come
forward,
my
lady,”
he
called
out,
smiling.

His
smile
emboldened
her,
made
her
feel
beautiful
and
strong.
He
does
love
me,
he
does.
Sansa
lifted
her
head
and
walked
toward
him,
not
too
slow
and
not
too
fast.
She
must
not
let
them
see
how
nervous
she
was.

“The
Lady
Sansa,
of
House
Stark,”
the
herald
cried.

She
stopped
under
the
throne,
at
the
spot
where
Ser
Barristan’s
white
cloak
lay
puddled
on
the
floor
beside
his
helm
and
breastplate.
“Do
you
have
some
business
for
king
and
council,
Sansa?”
the
queen
asked
from
the
council
table.

“I
do.”
She
knelt
on
the
cloak,
so
as
not
to
spoil
her
gown,
and
looked
up
at
her
prince
on
his
fearsome
black
throne.
“As
it
please
Your
Grace,
I
ask
mercy
for
my
father,
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
who
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.”
She
had
practiced
the
words
a
hundred
times.

The
queen
sighed.
“Sansa,
you
disappoint
me.
What
did
I
tell
you
about
traitor’s
blood?”

“Your
father
has
committed
grave
and
terrible
crimes,
my
lady,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
intoned.

“Ah,
poor
sad
thing,”
sighed
Varys.
“She
is
only
a
babe,
my
lords,
she
does
not
know
what
she
asks.”

Sansa
had
eyes
only
for
Joffrey.
He
must
listen
to
me,
he
must,
she
thought.
The
king
shifted
on
his
seat,
“Let
her
speak,”
he
commanded.
“I
want
to
hear
what
she
says.”

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace.”
Sansa
smiled,
a
shy
secret
smile,
just
for
him.
He
was
listening.
She
knew
he
would.

“Treason
is
a
noxious
weed,”
Pycelle
declared
solemnly.
“It
must
be
torn
up,
root
and
stem
and
seed,
lest
new
traitors
sprout
from
every
roadside.”

“Do
you
deny
your
father’s
crime?”
Lord
Baelish
asked.

“No,
my
lords.”
Sansa
knew
better
than
that.
“I
know
he
must
be
punished.
All
I
ask
is
mercy.
I
know
my
lord
father
must
regret
what
he
did.
He
was
King
Robert’s
friend
and
he
loved
him,
you
all
know
he
loved
him.
He
never
wanted
to
be
Hand
until
the
king
asked
him.
They
must
have
lied
to
him.
Lord
Renly
or
Lord
Stannis
or…
or
somebody,
they
must
have
lied,
otherwise…”

King
Joffrey
leaned
forward,
hands
grasping
the
arms
of
the
throne.
Broken
sword
points
fanned
out
between
his
fingers.
“He
said
I
wasn’t
the
king.
Why
did
he
say
that?”

“His
leg
was
broken,”
Sansa
replied
eagerly.
“It
hurt
ever
so
much,
Maester
Pycelle
was
giving
him
milk
of
the
poppy,
and
they
say
that
milk
of
the
poppy
fills
your
head
with
clouds.
Otherwise
he
would
never
have
said
it.”

Varys
said,
“A
child’s
faith…
such
sweet
innocence…
and
yet,
they
say
wisdom
oft
comes
from
the
mouths
of
babes.”

“Treason
is
treason,”
Pycelle
replied
at
once.

Joffrey
rocked
restlessly
on
the
throne.
“Mother?”

Cersei
Lannister
considered
Sansa
thoughtfully.
“If
Lord
Eddard
were
to
confess
his
crime,”
she
said
at
last,
“we
would
know
he
had
repented
his
folly.”

Joffrey
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
Please,
Sansa
thought,
please,
please,
be
the
king
I
know
you
are,
good
and
kind
and
noble,
please.
“Do
you
have
any
more
to
say?”
he
asked
her.

“Only…
that
as
you
love
me,
you
do
me
this
kindness,
my
prince,”
Sansa
said.

King
Joffrey
looked
her
up
and
down.
“Your
sweet
words
have
moved
me,”
he
said
gallantly,
nodding,
as
if
to
say
all
would
be
well.
“I
shall
do
as
you
ask…
but
first
your
father
has
to
confess.
He
has
to
confess
and
say
that
I’m
the
king,
or
there
will
be
no
mercy
for
him.”

“He
will,”
Sansa
said,
heart
soaring.
“Oh,
I
know
he
will.”





EDDARD

The
straw
on
the
floor
stank
of
urine.
There
was
no
window,
no
bed,
not
even
a
slop
bucket.
He
remembered
walls
of
pale
red
stone
festooned
with
patches
of
nitre,
a
grey
door
of
splintered
wood,
four
inches
thick
and
studded
with
iron.
He
had
seen
them,
briefly,
a
quick
glimpse
as
they
shoved
him
inside.
Once
the
door
had
slammed
shut,
he
had
seen
no
more.
The
dark
was
absolute.
He
had
as
well
been
blind.

Or
dead.
Buried
with
his
king.
“Ah,
Robert,”
he
murmured
as
his
groping
hand
touched
a
cold
stone
wall,
his
leg
throbbing
with
every
motion.
He
remembered
the
jest
the
king
had
shared
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell,
as
the
Kings
of
Winter
looked
on
with
cold
stone
eyes.
The
king
eats,
Robert
had
said,
and
the
Hand
takes
the
shit.
How
he
had
laughed.
Yet
he
had
gotten
it
wrong.
The
king
dies,
Ned
Stark
thought,
and
the
Hand
is
buried.

The
dungeon
was
under
the
Red
Keep,
deeper
than
he
dared
imagine.
He
remembered
the
old
stories
about
Maegor
the
Cruel,
who
murdered
all
the
masons
who
labored
on
his
castle,
so
they
might
never
reveal
its
secrets.

He
damned
them
all:
Littlefinger,
Janos
Slynt
and
his
gold
cloaks,
the
queen,
the
Kingslayer,
Pycelle
and
Varys
and
Ser
Barristan,
even
Lord
Renly,
Robert’s
own
blood,
who
had
run
when
he
was
needed
most.
Yet
in
the
end
he
blamed
himself.
“Fool,”
he
cried
to
the
darkness,
“thrice-damned
blind
fool.”

Cersei
Lannister’s
face
seemed
to
float
before
him
in
the
darkness.
Her
hair
was
full
of
sunlight,
but
there
was
mockery
in
her
smile.
“When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die,”
she
whispered.
Ned
had
played
and
lost,
and
his
men
had
paid
the
price
of
his
folly
with
their
life’s
blood.

When
he
thought
of
his
daughters,
he
would
have
wept
gladly,
but
the
tears
would
not
come.
Even
now,
he
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
his
grief
and
his
rage
froze
hard
inside
him.

When
he
kept
very
still,
his
leg
did
not
hurt
so
much,
so
he
did
his
best
to
lie
unmoving.
For
how
long
he
could
not
say.
There
was
no
sun
and
no
moon.
He
could
not
see
to
mark
the
walls.
Ned
closed
his
eyes
and
opened
them;
it
made
no
difference.
He
slept
and
woke
and
slept
again.
He
did
not
know
which
was
more
painful,
the
waking
or
the
sleeping.
When
he
slept,
he
dreamed:
dark
disturbing
dreams
of
blood
and
broken
promises.
When
he
woke,
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
think,
and
his
waking
thoughts
were
worse
than
nightmares.
The
thought
of
Cat
was
as
painful
as
a
bed
of
nettles.
He
wondered
where
she
was,
what
she
was
doing.
He
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
see
her
again.

Hours
turned
to
days,
or
so
it
seemed.
He
could
feel
a
dull
ache
in
his
shattered
leg,
an
itch
beneath
the
plaster.
When
he
touched
his
thigh,
the
flesh
was
hot
to
his
fingers.
The
only
sound
was
his
breathing.
After
a
time,
he
began
to
talk
aloud,
just
to
hear
a
voice.
He
made
plans
to
keep
himself
sane,
built
castles
of
hope
in
the
dark.
Robert’s
brothers
were
out
in
the
world,
raising
armies
at
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End.
Alyn
and
Harwin
would
return
to
King’s
Landing
with
the
rest
of
his
household
guard
once
they
had
dealt
with
Ser
Gregor.
Catelyn
would
raise
the
north
when
the
word
reached
her,
and
the
lords
of
river
and
mountain
and
Vale
would
join
her.

He
found
himself
thinking
of
Robert
more
and
more.
He
saw
the
king
as
he
had
been
in
the
flower
of
his
youth,
tall
and
handsome,
his
great
antlered
helm
on
his
head,
his
warhammer
in
hand,
sitting
his
horse
like
a
horned
god.
He
heard
his
laughter
in
the
dark,
saw
his
eyes,
blue
and
clear
as
mountain
lakes.
“Look
at
us,
Ned,”
Robert
said.
“Gods,
how
did
we
come
to
this?
You
here,
and
me
killed
by
a
pig.
We
won
a
throne
together…”

I
failed
you,
Robert,
Ned
thought.
He
could
not
say
the
words.
I
lied
to
you,
hid
the
truth.
I
let
them
kill
you.

The
king
heard
him.
“You
stiff-necked
fool,”
he
muttered,
“too
proud
to
listen.
Can
you
eat
pride,
Stark?
Will
honor
shield
your
children?”
Cracks
ran
down
his
face,
fissures
opening
in
the
flesh,
and
he
reached
up
and
ripped
the
mask
away.
It
was
not
Robert
at
all;
it
was
Littlefinger,
grinning,
mocking
him.
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
his
lies
turned
to
pale
grey
moths
and
took
wing.

Ned
was
half-asleep
when
the
footsteps
came
down
the
hall.
At
first
he
thought
he
dreamt
them;
it
had
been
so
long
since
he
had
heard
anything
but
the
sound
of
his
own
voice.
Ned
was
feverish
by
then,
his
leg
a
dull
agony,
his
lips
parched
and
cracked.
When
the
heavy
wooden
door
creaked
open,
the
sudden
light
was
painful
to
his
eyes.

A
gaoler
thrust
a
jug
at
him.
The
clay
was
cool
and
beaded
with
moisture.
Ned
grasped
it
with
both
hands
and
gulped
eagerly.
Water
ran
from
his
mouth
and
dripped
down
through
his
beard.
He
drank
until
he
thought
he
would
be
sick.
“How
long…?”
he
asked
weakly
when
he
could
drink
no
more.
>>>>>>> asd

The
gaoler
was
a
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
furtive
little
man
with
broken
veins
in
his
nose.
They
found
him
bent
over
a
tankard
of
ale
and
the
remains
of
a
pigeon
pie,
more
than
a
little
drunk.
He
squinted
at
them
suspiciously.
“Begging
your
forgiveness,
m’lady,
but
Lord
Edmure
says
no
one
is
to
see
the
Kingslayer
without
a
writing
from
him,
with
his
seal
upon
it.”

“Lord
Edmure?
Has
my
father
died,
and
no
one
told
me?”

The
gaoler
licked
his
lips.
“No,
m’lady,
not
as
I
knows.”

“You
will
open
the
cell,
or
you
will
come
with
me
to
Lord
Hoster’s
solar
and
tell
him
why
you
saw
fit
to
defy
me.”

His
eyes
fell.
“As
m’lady
says.”
The
keys
were
chained
to
the
studded
leather
belt
that
girdled
his
waist.
He
muttered
under
his
breath
as
he
sorted
through
them,
until
he
found
the
one
that
fit
the
door
to
the
Kingslayer’s
cell.

“Go
back
to
your
ale
and
leave
us,”
she
commanded.
An
oil
lamp
hung
from
a
hook
on
the
low
ceiling.
Catelyn
took
it
down
and
turned
up
the
flame.
“Brienne,
see
that
I
am
not
disturbed.”

Nodding,
Brienne
took
up
a
position
just
outside
the
cell,
her
hand
resting
on
the
pommel
of
her
sword.
“My
lady
will
call
if
she
has
need
of
me.”

Catelyn
shouldered
aside
the
heavy
wood-and-iron
door
and
stepped
into
foul
darkness.
This
was
the
bowels
of
Riverrun,
and
smelled
the
part.
Old
straw
crackled
underfoot.
The
walls
were
discolored
with
patches
of
nitre.
Through
the
stone,
she
could
hear
the
faint
rush
of
the
Tumblestone.
The
lamplight
revealed
a
pail
overflowing
with
feces
in
one
corner
and
a
huddled
shape
in
another.
The
flagon
of
wine
stood
beside
the
door,
untouched.
So
much
for
that
ploy.
I
ought
to
be
thankful
that
the
gaoler
did
not
drink
it
himself,
I
suppose.

Jaime
raised
his
hands
to
cover
his
face,
the
chains
around
his
wrists
clanking.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said,
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
disuse.
“I
fear
I
am
in
no
condition
to
receive
you.”

“Look
at
me,
ser.”

“The
light
hurts
my
eyes.
A
moment,
if
you
would.”
Jaime
Lannister
had
been
allowed
no
razor
since
the
night
he
was
taken
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
a
shaggy
beard
covered
his
face,
once
so
like
the
queen’s.
Glinting
gold
in
the
lamplight,
the
whiskers
made
him
look
like
some
great
yellow
beast,
magnificent
even
in
chains.
His
unwashed
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders
in
ropes
and
tangles,
the
clothes
were
rotting
on
his
body,
his
face
was
pale
and
wasted…
and
even
so,
the
power
and
the
beauty
of
the
man
were
still
apparent.

“I
see
you
had
no
taste
for
the
wine
I
sent
you.”

“Such
sudden
generosity
seemed
somewhat
suspect.”

“I
can
have
your
head
off
anytime
I
want.
Why
would
I
need
to
poison
you?”

“Death
by
poison
can
seem
natural.
Harder
to
claim
that
my
head
simply
fell
off.”
He
squinted
up
from
the
floor,
his
cat-green
eyes
slowly
becoming
accustomed
to
the
light.
“I’d
invite
you
to
sit,
but
your
brother
has
neglected
to
provide
me
a
chair.”

“I
can
stand
well
enough.”

“Can
you?
You
look
terrible,
I
must
say.
Though
perhaps
it’s
just
the
light
in
here.”
He
was
fettered
at
wrist
and
ankle,
each
cuff
chained
to
the
others,
so
he
could
neither
stand
nor
lie
comfortably.
The
ankle
chains
were
bolted
to
the
wall.
“Are
my
bracelets
heavy
enough
for
you,
or
did
you
come
to
add
a
few
more?
I’ll
rattle
them
prettily
if
you
like.”

“You
brought
this
on
yourself,”
she
reminded
him.
“We
granted
you
the
comfort
of
a
tower
cell
befitting
your
birth
and
station.
You
repaid
us
by
trying
to
escape.”

“A
cell
is
a
cell.
Some
under
Casterly
Rock
make
this
one
seem
a
sunlit
garden.
One
day
perhaps
I’ll
show
them
to
you.”

If
he
is
cowed,
he
hides
it
well,
Catelyn
thought.
“A
man
chained
hand
and
foot
should
keep
a
more
courteous
tongue
in
his
mouth,
ser.
I
did
not
come
here
to
be
threatened.”

“No?
Then
surely
it
was
to
have
your
pleasure
of
me?
It’s
said
that
widows
grow
weary
of
their
empty
beds.
We
of
the
Kingsguard
vow
never
to
wed,
but
I
suppose
I
could
still
service
you
if
that’s
what
you
need.
Pour
us
some
of
that
wine
and
slip
out
of
that
gown
and
we’ll
see
if
I’m
up
to
it.”

Catelyn
stared
down
at
him
in
revulsion.
Was
there
ever
a
man
as
beautiful
or
as
vile
as
this
one?
“If
you
said
that
in
my
son’s
hearing,
he
would
kill
you
for
it.”

“Only
so
long
as
I
was
wearing
these.”
Jaime
Lannister
rattled
his
chains
at
her.
“We
both
know
the
boy
is
afraid
to
face
me
in
single
combat.”

“My
son
may
be
young,
but
if
you
take
him
for
a
fool,
you
are
sadly
mistaken…
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
not
so
quick
to
make
challenges
when
you
had
an
army
at
your
back.”

“Did
the
old
Kings
of
Winter
hide
behind
their
mothers’
skirts
as
well?”

“I
grow
weary
of
this,
ser.
There
are
things
I
must
know.”

“Why
should
I
tell
you
anything?”

“To
save
your
life.”

“You
think
I
fear
death?”
That
seemed
to
amuse
him.

“You
should.
Your
crimes
will
have
earned
you
a
place
of
torment
in
the
deepest
of
the
seven
hells,
if
the
gods
are
just.”

“What
gods
are
those,
Lady
Catelyn?
The
trees
your
husband
prayed
to?
How
well
did
they
serve
him
when
my
sister
took
his
head
off?”
Jaime
gave
a
chuckle.
“If
there
are
gods,
why
is
the
world
so
full
of
pain
and
injustice?”

“Because
of
men
like
you.”

“There
are
no
men
like
me.
There’s
only
me.”

There
is
nothing
here
but
arrogance
and
pride,
and
the
empty
courage
of
a
madman.
I
am
wasting
my
breath
with
this
one.
If
there
was
ever
a
spark
of
honor
in
him,
it
is
long
dead.
“If
you
will
not
speak
with
me,
so
be
it.
Drink
the
wine
or
piss
in
it,
ser,
it
makes
no
matter
to
me.”

Her
hand
was
at
the
door
pull
when
he
said,
“Lady
Stark.”
She
turned,
waited.
“Things
go
to
rust
in
this
damp,”
Jaime
went
on.
“Even
a
man’s
courtesies.
Stay,
and
you
shall
have
your
answers…
for
a
price.”

He
has
no
shame.
“Captives
do
not
set
prices.”

“Oh,
you’ll
find
mine
modest
enough.
Your
turnkey
tells
me
nothing
but
vile
lies,
and
he
cannot
even
keep
them
straight.
One
day
he
says
Cersei
has
been
flayed,
and
the
next
it’s
my
father.
Answer
my
questions
and
I’ll
answer
yours.”

“Truthfully?”

“Oh,
it’s
truth
you
want?
Be
careful,
my
lady.
Tyrion
says
that
people
often
claim
to
hunger
for
truth,
but
seldom
like
the
taste
when
it’s
served
up.”

“I
am
strong
enough
to
hear
anything
you
care
to
say.”

“As
you
will,
then.
But
first,
if
you’d
be
so
kind…
the
wine.
My
throat
is
raw.”

Catelyn
hung
the
lamp
from
the
door
and
moved
the
cup
and
flagon
closer.
Jaime
sloshed
the
wine
around
his
mouth
before
he
swallowed.
“Sour
and
vile,”
he
said,
“but
it
will
do.”
He
put
his
back
to
the
wall,
drew
his
knees
up
to
his
chest,
and
stared
at
her.
“Your
first
question,
Lady
Catelyn?”

Not
knowing
how
long
this
game
might
continue,
Catelyn
wasted
no
time.
“Are
you
Joffrey’s
father?”

“You
would
never
ask
unless
you
knew
the
answer.”

“I
want
it
from
your
own
lips.”

He
shrugged.
“Joffrey
is
mine.
As
are
the
rest
of
Cersei’s
brood,
I
suppose.”

“You
admit
to
being
your
sister’s
lover?”

“I’ve
always
loved
my
sister,
and
you
owe
me
two
answers.
Do
all
my
kin
still
live?”

“Ser
Stafford
Lannister
was
slain
at
Oxcross,
I
am
told.”

Jaime
was
unmoved.
“Uncle
Dolt,
my
sister
called
him.
it’s
Cersei
and
Tyrion
who
concern
me.
As
well
as
my
lord
father.”

“They
live,
all
three.”
But
not
long,
if
the
gods
are
good.

Jaime
drank
some
more
wine.
“Ask
your
next.”

Catelyn
wondered
if
he
would
dare
answer
her
next
question
with
anything
but
a
lie.
“How
did
my
son
Bran
come
to
fall?”

“I
flung
him
from
a
window.”

The
easy
way
he
said
it
took
her
voice
away
for
an
instant.
If
I
had
a
knife,
I
would
kill
him
now,
she
thought,
until
she
remembered
the
girls.
Her
throat
constricted
as
she
said,
“You
were
a
knight,
sworn
to
defend
the
weak
and
innocent.”

“He
was
weak
enough,
but
perhaps
not
so
innocent.
He
was
spying
on
us.”

“Bran
would
not
spy.”

“Then
blame
those
precious
gods
of
yours,
who
brought
the
boy
to
our
window
and
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
something
he
was
never
meant
to
see.”

“Blame
the
gods?”
she
said,
incredulous.
“Yours
was
the
hand
that
threw
him.
You
meant
for
him
to
die.”

His
chains
chinked
softly.
“I
seldom
fling
children
from
towers
to
improve
their
health.
Yes,
I
meant
for
him
to
die.”

“And
when
he
did
not,
you
knew
your
danger
was
worse
than
ever,
so
you
gave
your
catspaw
a
bag
of
silver
to
make
certain
Bran
would
never
wake.”

“Did
I
now?”
Jaime
lifted
his
cup
and
took
a
long
swallow.
“I
won’t
deny
we
talked
of
it,
but
you
were
with
the
boy
day
and
night,
your
maester
and
Lord
Eddard
attended
him
frequently,
and
there
were
guards,
even
those
damned
direwolves…
it
would
have
required
cutting
my
way
through
half
of
Winterfell.
And
why
bother,
when
the
boy
seemed
like
to
die
of
his
own
accord?”

“If
you
lie
to
me,
this
session
is
at
an
end.”
Catelyn
held
out
her
hands,
to
show
him
her
fingers
and
palms.
“The
man
who
came
to
slit
Bran’s
throat
gave
me
these
scars.
You
swear
you
had
no
part
in
sending
him?”

“On
my
honor
as
a
Lannister.”

“Your
honor
as
a
Lannister
is
worth
less
than
this.”
She
kicked
over
the
waste
pail.
Foul-smelling
brown
ooze
crept
across
the
floor
of
the
cell,
soaking
into
the
straw.

Jaime
Lannister
backed
away
from
the
spill
as
far
as
his
chains
would
allow.
“I
may
indeed
have
shit
for
honor,
I
won’t
deny
it,
but
I
have
never
yet
hired
anyone
to
do
my
killing.
Believe
what
you
will,
Lady
Stark,
but
if
I
had
wanted
your
Bran
dead
I
would
have
slain
him
myself.”

Gods
be
merciful,
he’s
telling
the
truth.
“If
you
did
not
send
the
killer,
your
sister
did.”

“If
so,
I’d
know.
Cersei
keeps
no
secrets
from
me.”

“Then
it
was
the
Imp.”

“Tyrion
is
as
innocent
as
your
Bran.
He
wasn’t
climbing
around
outside
of
anyone’s
window,
spying.”

“Then
why
did
the
assassin
have
his
dagger?”

“What
dagger
was
this?”

“It
was
so
long,”
she
said,
holding
her
hands
apart,
“plain,
but
finely
made,
with
a
blade
of
Valyrian
steel
and
a
dragonbone
hilt.
Your
brother
won
it
from
Lord
Baelish
at
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day.”

Lannister
poured,
drank,
poured,
and
stared
into
his
wine
cup.
“This
wine
seems
to
be
improving
as
I
drink
it.
Imagine
that.
I
seem
to
remember
that
dagger,
now
that
you
describe
it.
Won
it,
you
say?
How?”

“Wagering
on
you
when
you
tilted
against
the
Knight
of
Flowers.”
Yet
when
she
heard
her
own
words
Catelyn
knew
she
had
gotten
it
wrong.
“No…
was
it
the
other
way?”

“Tyrion
always
backed
me
in
the
lists,”
Jaime
said,
“but
that
day
Ser
Loras
unhorsed
me.
A
mischance,
I
took
the
boy
too
lightly,
but
no
matter.
Whatever
my
brother
wagered,
he
lost…
but
that
dagger
did
change
hands,
I
recall
it
now.
Robert
showed
it
to
me
that
night
at
the
feast.
His
Grace
loved
to
salt
my
wounds,
especially
when
drunk.
And
when
was
he
not
drunk?”

Tyrion
Lannister
had
said
much
the
same
thing
as
they
rode
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
Catelyn
remembered.
She
had
refused
to
believe
him.
Petyr
had
sworn
otherwise,
Petyr
who
had
been
almost
a
brother,
Petyr
who
loved
her
so
much
he
fought
a
duel
for
her
hand…
and
yet
if
Jaime
and
Tyrion
told
the
same
tale,
what
did
that
mean?
The
brothers
had
not
seen
each
other
since
departing
Winterfell
more
than
a
year
ago.
“Are
you
trying
to
deceive
me?”
Somewhere
there
was
a
trap
here.

“I’ve
admitted
to
shoving
your
precious
urchin
out
a
window,
what
would
it
gain
me
to
lie
about
this
knife?”
He
tossed
down
another
cup
of
wine.
“Believe
what
you
will,
I’m
past
caring
what
people
say
of
me.
And
it’s
my
turn.
Have
Robert’s
brothers
taken
the
field?”

“They
have.”

“Now
there’s
a
niggardly
response.
Give
me
more
than
that,
or
your
next
answer
will
be
as
poor.”

“Stannis
marches
against
King’s
Landing,”
she
said
grudgingly.
“Renly
is
dead,
murdered
at
Bitterbridge
by
his
brother,
through
some
black
art
I
do
not
understand.”

“A
pity,”
Jaime
said.
“I
rather
liked
Renly,
though
Stannis
is
quite
another
tale.
What
side
have
the
Tyrells
taken?”

“Renly,
at
first.
Now,
I
could
not
say.”

“Your
boy
must
be
feeling
lonely.”

“Robb
was
sixteen
a
few
days
past…
a
man
grown,
and
a
king.
He’s
won
every
battle
he’s
fought.
The
last
word
we
had
from
him,
he
had
taken
the
Crag
from
the
Westerlings.”

“He
hasn’t
faced
my
father
yet,
has
he?”

“When
he
does,
he’ll
defeat
him.
As
he
did
you.”

“He
took
me
unawares.
A
craven’s
trick.”

“You
dare
talk
of
tricks?
Your
brother
Tyrion
sent
us
cutthroats
in
envoy’s
garb,
under
a
peace
banner.”

“If
it
were
one
of
your
sons
in
this
cell,
wouldn’t
his
brothers
do
as
much
for
him?”

My
son
has
no
brothers,
she
thought,
but
she
would
not
share
her
pain
with
a
creature
such
as
this.

Jaime
drank
some
more
wine.
“What’s
a
brother’s
life
when
honor
is
at
stake,
eh?”
Another
sip.
“Tyrion
is
clever
enough
to
realize
that
your
son
will
never
consent
to
ransom
me.”

Catelyn
could
not
deny
it.
“Robb’s
bannermen
would
sooner
see
you
dead.
Rickard
Karstark
in
particular.
You
slew
two
of
his
sons
in
the
Whispering
Wood.”

“The
two
with
the
white
sunburst,
were
they?”
Jaime
gave
a
shrug.
“If
truth
be
told,
it
was
your
son
that
I
was
trying
to
slay.
The
others
got
in
my
way.
I
killed
them
in
fair
fight,
in
the
heat
of
battle.
Any
other
knight
would
have
done
the
same.”

“How
can
you
still
count
yourself
a
knight,
when
you
have
forsaken
every
vow
you
ever
swore?”

Jaime
reached
for
the
flagon
to
refill
his
cup.
“So
many
vows…
they
make
you
swear
and
swear.
Defend
the
king.
Obey
the
king.
Keep
his
secrets.
Do
his
bidding.
Your
life
for
his.
But
obey
your
father.
Love
your
sister.
Protect
the
innocent.
Defend
the
weak.
Respect
the
gods.
Obey
the
laws.
It’s
too
much.
No
matter
what
you
do,
you’re
forsaking
one
vow
or
the
other.”
He
took
a
healthy
swallow
of
wine
and
closed
his
eyes
for
an
instant,
leaning
his
head
back
against
the
patch
of
nitre
on
the
wall.
“I
was
the
youngest
man
ever
to
wear
the
white
cloak.”

“And
the
youngest
to
betray
all
it
stood
for,
Kingslayer.”

“Kingslayer,”
he
pronounced
carefully.
“And
such
a
king
he
was!”
He
lifted
his
cup.
“To
Aerys
Targaryen,
the
Second
of
His
Name,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
And
to
the
sword
that
opened
his
throat.
A
golden
sword,
don’t
you
know.
Until
his
blood
ran
red
down
the
blade.
Those
are
the
Lannister
colors,
red
and
gold.”

As
he
laughed,
she
realized
the
wine
had
done
its
work;
Jaime
had
drained
most
of
the
flagon,
and
he
was
drunk.
“Only
a
man
like
you
would
be
proud
of
such
an
act.”

“I
told
you,
there
are
no
men
like
me.
Answer
me
this,
Lady
Stark—did
your
Ned
ever
tell
you
the
manner
of
his
father’s
death?
Or
his
brother’s?”

“They
strangled
Brandon
while
his
father
watched,
and
then
killed
Lord
Rickard
as
well.”
An
ugly
tale,
and
sixteen
years
old.
Why
was
he
asking
about
it
now?

“Killed,
yes,
but
how?”

“The
cord
or
the
axe,
I
suppose.”

Jaime
took
a
swallow,
wiped
his
mouth.
“No
doubt
Ned
wished
to
spare
you.
His
sweet
young
bride,
if
not
quite
a
maiden.
Well,
you
wanted
truth.
Ask
me.
We
made
a
bargain,
I
can
deny
you
nothing.
Ask.”

“Dead
is
dead.”
I
do
not
want
to
know
this.

“Brandon
was
different
from
his
brother,
wasn’t
he?
He
had
blood
in
his
veins
instead
of
cold
water.
More
like
me.”

“Brandon
was
nothing
like
you.”

“If
you
say
so.
You
and
he
were
to
wed.”

“He
was
on
his
way
to
Riverrun
when…”
Strange,
how
telling
it
still
made
her
throat
grow
tight,
after
all
these
years.
“…when
he
heard
about
Lyanna,
and
went
to
King’s
Landing
instead.
It
was
a
rash
thing
to
do.”
She
remembered
how
her
own
father
had
raged
when
the
news
had
been
brought
to
Riverrun.
The
gallant
fool,
was
what
he
called
Brandon.

Jaime
poured
the
last
half
cup
of
wine.
“He
rode
into
the
Red
Keep
with
a
few
companions,
shouting
for
Prince
Rhaegar
to
come
out
and
die.
But
Rhaegar
wasn’t
there.
Aerys
sent
his
guards
to
arrest
them
all
for
plotting
his
son’s
murder.
The
others
were
lords’
sons
too,
it
seems
to
me.”

“Ethan
Glover
was
Brandon’s
squire,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
was
the
only
one
to
survive.
The
others
were
Jeffory
Mallister,
Kyle
Royce,
and
Elbert
Arryn,
Jon
Arryn’s
nephew
and
heir.”
It
was
queer
how
she
still
remembered
the
names,
after
so
many
years.
“Aerys
accused
them
of
treason
and
summoned
their
fathers
to
court
to
answer
the
charge,
with
the
sons
as
hostages.
When
they
came,
he
had
them
murdered
without
trial.
Fathers
and
sons
both.”

“There
were
trials.
Of
a
sort.
Lord
Rickard
demanded
trial
by
combat,
and
the
king
granted
the
request.
Stark
armored
himself
as
for
battle,
thinking
to
duel
one
of
the
Kingsguard.
Me,
perhaps.
Instead
they
took
him
to
the
throne
room
and
suspended
him
from
the
rafters
while
two
of
Aerys’s
pyromancers
kindled
a
blaze
beneath
him.
The
king
told
him
that
fire
was
the
champion
of
House
Targaryen.
So
all
Lord
Rickard
needed
to
do
to
prove
himself
innocent
of
treason
was…
well,
not
burn.

“When
the
fire
was
blazing,
Brandon
was
brought
in.
His
hands
were
chained
behind
his
back,
and
around
his
neck
was
a
wet
leathern
cord
attached
to
a
device
the
king
had
brought
from
Tyrosh.
His
legs
were
left
free,
though,
and
his
longsword
was
set
down
just
beyond
his
reach.

“The
pyromancers
roasted
Lord
Rickard
slowly,
banking
and
fanning
that
fire
carefully
to
get
a
nice
even
heat.
His
cloak
caught
first,
and
then
his
surcoat,
and
soon
he
wore
nothing
but
metal
and
ashes.
Next
he
would
start
to
cook,
Aerys
promised…
unless
his
son
could
free
him.
Brandon
tried,
but
the
more
he
struggled,
the
tighter
the
cord
constricted
around
his
throat.
In
the
end
he
strangled
himself.

“As
for
Lord
Rickard,
the
steel
of
his
breastplate
turned
cherry-red
before
the
end,
and
his
gold
melted
off
his
spurs
and
dripped
down
into
the
fire.
I
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne
in
my
white
armor
and
white
cloak,
filling
my
head
with
thoughts
of
Cersei.
After,
Gerold
Hightower
himself
took
me
aside
and
said
to
me,
‘You
swore
a
vow
to
guard
the
king,
not
to
judge
him.’
That
was
the
White
Bull,
loyal
to
the
end
and
a
better
man
than
me,
all
agree.”

“Aerys…”
Catelyn
could
taste
bile
at
the
back
of
her
throat.
The
story
was
so
hideous
she
suspected
it
had
to
be
true.
“Aerys
was
mad,
the
whole
realm
knew
it,
but
if
you
would
have
me
believe
you
slew
him
to
avenge
Brandon
Stark…”

“I
made
no
such
claim.
The
Starks
were
nothing
to
me.
I
will
say,
I
think
it
passing
odd
that
I
am
loved
by
one
for
a
kindness
I
never
did,
and
reviled
by
so
many
for
my
finest
act.
At
Robert’s
coronation,
I
was
made
to
kneel
at
the
royal
feet
beside
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
and
Varys
the
eunuch,
so
that
he
might
forgive
us
our
crimes
before
he
took
us
into
his
service.
As
for
your
Ned,
he
should
have
kissed
the
hand
that
slew
Aerys,
but
he
preferred
to
scorn
the
arse
he
found
sitting
on
Robert’s
throne.
I
think
Ned
Stark
loved
Robert
better
than
he
ever
loved
his
brother
or
his
father…
or
even
you,
my
lady.
He
was
never
unfaithful
to
Robert,
was
he?”
Jaime
gave
a
drunken
laugh.
“Come,
Lady
Stark,
don’t
you
find
this
all
terribly
amusing?”

“I
find
nothing
about
you
amusing,
Kingslayer.”

“That
name
again.
I
don’t
think
I’ll
fuck
you
after
all,
Littlefinger
had
you
first,
didn’t
he?
I
never
eat
off
another
man’s
trencher.
Besides,
you’re
not
half
so
lovely
as
my
sister.”
His
smile
cut.
“I’ve
never
lain
with
any
woman
but
Cersei.
In
my
own
way,
I
have
been
truer
than
your
Ned
ever
was.
Poor
old
dead
Ned.
So
who
has
shit
for
honor
now,
I
ask
you?
What
was
the
name
of
that
bastard
he
fathered?”

Catelyn
took
a
step
backward.
“Brienne.”

“No,
that
wasn’t
it.”
Jaime
Lannister
upended
the
flagon.
A
trickle
ran
down
onto
his
face,
bright
as
blood.
“Snow,
that
was
the
one.
Such
a
white
name…
like
the
pretty
cloaks
they
give
us
in
the
Kingsguard
when
we
swear
our
pretty
oaths.”

Brienne
pushed
open
the
door
and
stepped
inside
the
cell.
“You
called,
my
lady?”

“Give
me
your
sword.”
Catelyn
held
out
her
hand.





THEON

The
sky
was
a
gloom
of
cloud,
the
woods
dead
and
frozen.
Roots
grabbed
at
Theon’s
feet
as
he
ran,
and
bare
branches
lashed
his
face,
leaving
thin
stripes
of
blood
across
his
cheeks.
He
crashed
through
heedless,
breathless,
icicles
flying
to
pieces
before
him.
Mercy,
he
sobbed.
From
behind
came
a
shuddering
howl
that
curdled
his
blood.
Mercy,
mercy.
When
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
them
coming,
great
wolves
the
size
of
horses
with
the
heads
of
small
children.
Oh,
mercy,
mercy.
Blood
dripped
from
their
mouths
black
as
pitch,
burning
holes
in
the
snow
where
it
fell.
Every
stride
brought
them
closer.
Theon
tried
to
run
faster,
but
his
legs
would
not
obey.
The
trees
all
had
faces,
and
they
were
laughing
at
him,
laughing,
and
the
howl
came
again.
He
could
smell
the
hot
breath
of
the
beasts
behind
him,
a
stink
of
brimstone
and
corruption.
They’re
dead,
dead,
I
saw
them
killed,
he
tried
to
shout,
I
saw
their
heads
dipped
in
tar,
but
when
he
opened
his
mouth
only
a
moan
emerged,
and
then
something
touched
him
and
he
whirled,
shouting…

…flailing
for
the
dagger
he
kept
by
his
bedside
and
managing
only
to
knock
it
to
the
floor.
Wex
danced
away
from
him.
Reek
stood
behind
the
mute,
his
face
lit
from
below
by
the
candle
he
carried.
“What?”
Theon
cried.
Mercy.
“What
do
you
want?
Why
are
you
in
my
bedchamber?
Why?”

“My
lord
prince,”
said
Reek,
“your
sister
has
come
to
Winterfell.
You
asked
to
be
informed
at
once
if
she
arrived.”

“Past
time,”
Theon
muttered,
pushing
his
fingers
through
his
hair.
He
had
begun
to
fear
that
Asha
meant
to
leave
him
to
his
fate.
Mercy.
He
glanced
outside
the
window,
where
the
first
vague
light
of
dawn
was
just
brushing
the
towers
of
Winterfell.
“Where
is
she?”

“Lorren
took
her
and
her
men
to
the
Great
Hall
to
break
their
fast.
Will
you
see
her
now?”

“Yes.”
Theon
pushed
off
the
blankets.
The
fire
had
burned
down
to
embers.
“Wex,
hot
water.”
He
could
not
let
Asha
see
him
disheveled
and
soaked
with
sweat.
Wolves
with
children’s
faces…
He
shivered.
“Close
the
shutters.”
The
bedchamber
felt
as
cold
as
the
dream
forest
had
been.

All
his
dreams
had
been
cold
of
late,
and
each
more
hideous
than
the
one
before.
Last
night
he
had
dreamed
himself
back
in
the
mill
again,
on
his
knees
dressing
the
dead.
Their
limbs
were
already
stiffening,
so
they
seemed
to
resist
sullenly
as
he
fumbled
at
them
with
half-frozen
fingers,
tugging
up
breeches
and
knotting
laces,
yanking
fur-trimmed
boots
over
hard
unbending
feet,
buckling
a
studded
leather
belt
around
a
waist
no
bigger
than
the
span
of
his
hands.
“This
was
never
what
I
wanted,”
he
told
them
as
he
worked.
“They
gave
me
no
choice.”
The
corpses
made
no
answer,
but
only
grew
colder
and
heavier.

The
night
before,
it
had
been
the
miller’s
wife.
Theon
had
forgotten
her
name,
but
he
remembered
her
body,
soft
pillowy
breasts
and
stretch
marks
on
her
belly,
the
way
she
clawed
his
back
when
he
fucked
her.
Last
night
in
his
dream
he
had
been
in
bed
with
her
once
again,
but
this
time
she
had
teeth
above
and
below,
and
she
tore
out
his
throat
even
as
she
was
gnawing
off
his
manhood.
It
was
madness.
He’d
seen
her
die
too.
Gelmarr
had
cut
her
down
with
one
blow
of
his
axe
as
she
cried
to
Theon
for
mercy.
Leave
me,
woman.
It
was
him
who
killed
you,
not
me.
And
he’s
dead
as
well.
At
least
Gelmarr
did
not
haunt
Theon’s
sleep.

The
dream
had
receded
by
the
time
Wex
returned
with
the
water.
Theon
washed
the
sweat
and
sleep
from
his
body
and
took
his
own
good
time
dressing.
Asha
had
let
him
wait
long
enough;
now
it
was
her
turn.
He
chose
a
satin
tunic
striped
black
and
gold
and
a
fine
leather
jerkin
with
silver
studs…
and
only
then
remembered
that
his
wretched
sister
put
more
stock
in
blades
than
beauty.
Cursing,
he
tore
off
the
clothes
and
dressed
again,
in
felted
black
wool
and
ringmail.
Around
his
waist
he
buckled
sword
and
dagger,
remembering
the
night
she
had
humiliated
him
at
his
own
father’s
table.
Her
sweet
suckling
babe,
yes.
Well,
I
have
a
knife
too,
and
know
how
to
use
it.

Last
of
all,
he
donned
his
crown,
a
band
of
cold
iron
slim
as
a
finger,
set
with
heavy
chunks
of
black
diamond
and
nuggets
of
gold.
It
was
misshapen
and
ugly,
but
there
was
no
help
for
that.
Mikken
lay
buried
in
the
lichyard,
and
the
new
smith
was
capable
of
little
more
than
nails
and
horseshoes.
Theon
consoled
himself
with
the
reminder
that
it
was
only
a
prince’s
crown.
He
would
have
something
much
finer
when
he
was
crowned
king.

Outside
his
door,
Reek
waited
with
Urzen
and
Kromm.
Theon
fell
in
with
them.
These
days,
he
took
guards
with
him
everywhere
he
went,
even
to
the
privy.
Winterfell
wanted
him
dead.
The
very
night
they
had
returned
from
Acorn
Water,
Gelmarr
the
Grim
had
tumbled
down
some
steps
and
broken
his
back.
The
next
day,
Aggar
turned
up
with
his
throat
slit
ear
to
ear.
Gynir
Rednose
became
so
wary
that
he
shunned
wine,
took
to
sleeping
in
byrnie,
coif,
and
helm,
and
adopted
the
noisiest
dog
in
the
kennels
to
give
him
warning
should
anyone
try
to
steal
up
on
his
sleeping
place.
All
the
same,
one
morning
the
castle
woke
to
the
sound
of
the
little
dog
barking
wildly.
They
found
the
pup
racing
around
the
well,
and
Rednose
floating
in
it,
drowned.

He
could
not
let
the
killings
go
unpunished.
Farlen
was
as
likely
a
suspect
as
any,
so
Theon
sat
in
judgment,
called
him
guilty,
and
condemned
him
to
death.
Even
that
went
sour.
As
he
knelt
to
the
block,
the
kennelmaster
said,
“M’lord
Eddard
always
did
his
own
killings.”
Theon
had
to
take
the
axe
himself
or
look
a
weakling.
His
hands
were
sweating,
so
the
shaft
twisted
in
his
grip
as
he
swung
and
the
first
blow
landed
between
Farlen’s
shoulders.
It
took
three
more
cuts
to
hack
through
all
that
bone
and
muscle
and
sever
the
head
from
the
body,
and
afterward
he
was
sick,
remembering
all
the
times
they’d
sat
over
a
cup
of
mead
talking
of
hounds
and
hunting.
I
had
no
choice,
he
wanted
to
scream
at
the
corpse.
The
ironborn
can’t
keep
secrets,
they
had
to
die,
and
someone
had
to
take
the
blame
for
it.
He
only
wished
he
had
killed
him
cleaner.
Ned
Stark
had
never
needed
more
than
a
single
blow
to
take
a
man’s
head.

The
killings
stopped
after
Farlen’s
death,
but
even
so
his
men
continued
sullen
and
anxious.
“They
fear
no
foe
in
open
battle,”
Black
Lorren
told
him,
“but
it
is
another
thing
to
dwell
among
enemies,
never
knowing
if
the
washerwoman
means
to
kiss
you
or
kill
you,
or
whether
the
serving
boy
is
filling
your
cup
with
ale
or
bale.
We
would
do
well
to
leave
this
place.”

“I
am
the
Prince
of
Winterfell!”
Theon
had
shouted.
“This
is
my
seat,
no
man
will
drive
me
from
it.
No,
nor
woman
either!”

Asha.
It
was
her
doing.
My
own
sweet
sister,
may
the
Others
bugger
her
with
a
sword.
She
wanted
him
dead,
so
she
could
steal
his
place
as
their
father’s
heir.
That
was
why
she
had
let
him
languish
here,
ignoring
the
urgent
commands
he
had
sent
her.

He
found
her
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks,
ripping
a
capon
apart
with
her
fingers.
The
hall
rang
with
the
voices
of
her
men,
sharing
stories
with
Theon’s
own
as
they
drank
together.
They
were
so
loud
that
his
entrance
went
all
but
unnoticed.
“Where
are
the
rest?”
he
demanded
of
Reek.
There
were
no
more
than
fifty
men
at
the
trestle
tables,
most
of
them
his.
Winterfell’s
Great
Hall
could
have
seated
ten
times
the
number.

“This
is
the
whole
o’
the
company,
m’lord
prince.”

“The
whole—how
many
men
did
she
bring?”

“Twenty,
by
my
count.”

Theon
Greyjoy
strode
to
where
his
sister
was
sprawled.
Asha
was
laughing
at
something
one
of
her
men
had
said,
but
broke
off
at
his
approach.
“Why,
’tis
the
Prince
of
Winterfell.”
She
tossed
a
bone
to
one
of
the
dogs
sniffing
about
the
hall.
Under
that
hawk’s
beak
of
a
nose,
her
wide
mouth
twisted
in
a
mocking
grin.
“Or
is
it
Prince
of
Fools?”

“Envy
ill
becomes
a
maid.”

Asha
sucked
grease
from
her
fingers.
A
lock
of
black
hair
fell
across
her
eyes.
Her
men
were
shouting
for
bread
and
bacon.
They
made
a
deal
of
noise,
as
few
as
they
were.
“Envy,
Theon?”

“What
else
would
you
call
it?
With
thirty
men,
I
captured
Winterfell
in
a
night.
You
needed
a
thousand
and
a
moon’s
turn
to
take
Deepwood
Motte.”

“Well,
I’m
no
great
warrior
like
you,
brother,”
She
quaffed
half
a
horn
of
ale
and
wiped
her
mouth
with
the
back
of
her
hand.
“I
saw
the
heads
above
your
gates.
Tell
me
true,
which
one
gave
you
the
fiercest
fight,
the
cripple
or
the
babe?”

Theon
could
feel
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face.
He
took
no
joy
from
those
heads,
no
more
than
he
had
in
displaying
the
headless
bodies
of
the
children
before
the
castle.
Old
Nan
stood
with
her
soft
toothless
mouth
opening
and
closing
soundlessly,
and
Farlen
threw
himself
at
Theon,
snarling
like
one
of
his
hounds.
Urzen
and
Cadwyl
had
to
beat
him
senseless
with
the
butts
of
their
spears.
How
did
I
come
to
this?
he
remembered
thinking
as
he
stood
over
the
fly-speckled
bodies.

Only
Maester
Luwin
had
the
stomach
to
come
near.
Stone-faced,
the
small
grey
man
had
begged
leave
to
sew
the
boys’
heads
back
onto
their
shoulders,
so
they
might
be
laid
in
the
crypts
below
with
the
other
Stark
dead.

“No,”
Theon
had
told
him.
“Not
the
crypts.”

“But
why,
my
lord?
Surely
they
cannot
harm
you
now.
It
is
where
they
belong.
All
the
bones
of
the
Starks—”

“I
said
no.”
He
needed
the
heads
for
the
wall,
but
he
had
burned
the
headless
bodies
that
very
day,
in
all
their
finery.
Afterward
he
had
knelt
amongst
the
bones
and
ashes
to
retrieve
a
slag
of
melted
silver
and
cracked
jet,
all
that
remained
of
the
wolf’s-head
brooch
that
had
once
been
Bran’s.
He
had
it
still.

“I
treated
Bran
and
Rickon
generously,”
he
told
his
sister.
“They
brought
their
fate
on
themselves.”

“As
do
we
all,
little
brother.”

His
patience
was
at
an
end.
“How
do
you
expect
me
to
hold
Winterfell
if
you
bring
me
only
twenty
men?”

“Ten,”
Asha
corrected.
“The
others
return
with
me.
You
wouldn’t
want
your
own
sweet
sister
to
brave
the
dangers
of
the
wood
without
an
escort,
would
you?
There
are
direwolves
prowling
the
dark.”
She
uncoiled
from
the
great
stone
seat
and
rose
to
her
feet.
“Come,
let
us
go
somewhere
we
can
speak
more
privily.”

She
was
right,
he
knew,
though
it
galled
him
that
she
would
make
that
decision.
I
should
never
have
come
to
the
hall,
he
realized
belatedly.
I
should
have
summoned
her
to
me.

It
was
too
late
for
that
now,
however.
Theon
had
no
choice
but
to
lead
Asha
to
Ned
Stark’s
solar.
There,
before
the
ashes
of
a
dead
fire,
he
blurted,
“Dagmer’s
lost
the
fight
at
Torrhen’s
Square—”

“The
old
castellan
broke
his
shield
wall,
yes,”
Asha
said
calmly.
“What
did
you
expect?
This
Ser
Rodrik
knows
the
land
intimately,
as
the
Cleftjaw
does
not,
and
many
of
the
northmen
were
mounted.
The
ironborn
lack
the
discipline
to
stand
a
charge
of
armored
horse.
Dagmer
lives,
be
grateful
for
that
much.
He’s
leading
the
survivors
back
toward
the
Stony
Shore.”

She
knows
more
than
I
do,
Theon
realized.
That
only
made
him
angrier.
“The
victory
has
given
Leobald
Tallhart
the
courage
to
come
out
from
behind
his
walls
and
join
Ser
Rodrik.
And
I’ve
had
reports
that
Lord
Manderly
has
sent
a
dozen
barges
upriver
packed
with
knights,
warhorses,
and
siege
engines.
The
Umbers
are
gathering
beyond
the
Last
River
as
well.
I’ll
have
an
army
at
my
gates
before
the
moon
turns,
and
you
bring
me
only
ten
men?”

“I
need
not
have
brought
you
any.”

“I
commanded
you—”

“Father
commanded
me
to
take
Deepwood
Motte,”
she
snapped.
“He
said
nothing
of
me
having
to
rescue
my
little
brother.”

“Bugger
Deepwood,”
he
said.
“It’s
a
wooden
pisspot
on
a
hill.
Winterfell
is
the
heart
of
the
land,
but
how
am
I
to
hold
it
without
a
garrison?”

“You
might
have
thought
of
that
before
you
took
it.
Oh,
it
was
cleverly
done,
I’ll
grant
you.
If
only
you’d
had
the
good
sense
to
raze
the
castle
and
carry
the
two
little
princelings
back
to
Pyke
as
hostages,
you
might
have
won
the
war
in
a
stroke.”

“You’d
like
that,
wouldn’t
you?
To
see
my
prize
reduced
to
ruins
and
ashes.”

“Your
prize
will
be
the
doom
of
you.
Krakens
rise
from
the
sea,
Theon,
or
did
you
forget
that
during
your
years
among
the
wolves?
Our
strength
is
in
our
longships.
My
wooden
pisspot
sits
close
enough
to
the
sea
for
supplies
and
fresh
men
to
reach
me
whenever
they
are
needful.
But
Winterfell
is
hundreds
of
leagues
inland,
ringed
by
woods,
hills,
and
hostile
holdfasts
and
castles.
And
every
man
in
a
thousand
leagues
is
your
enemy
now,
make
no
mistake.
You
made
certain
of
that
when
you
mounted
those
heads
on
your
gatehouse.”
Asha
shook
her
head.
“How
could
you
be
such
a
bloody
fool?
Children…”

“They
defied
me!”
he
shouted
in
her
face.
“And
it
was
blood
for
blood
besides,
two
sons
of
Eddard
Stark
to
pay
for
Rodrik
and
Maron.”
The
words
tumbled
out
heedlessly,
but
Theon
knew
at
once
that
his
father
would
approve.
“I’ve
laid
my
brothers’
ghosts
to
rest.”

“Our
brothers,”
Asha
reminded
him,
with
a
half
smile
that
suggested
she
took
his
talk
of
vengeance
well
salted.
“Did
you
bring
their
ghosts
from
Pyke,
brother?
And
here
I
thought
they
haunted
only
Father.”

“When
has
a
maid
ever
understood
a
man’s
need
for
revenge?”
Even
if
his
father
did
not
appreciate
the
gift
of
Winterfell,
he
must
approve
of
Theon
avenging
his
brothers!

Asha
snorted
back
a
laugh.
“This
Ser
Rodrik
may
well
feel
the
same
manly
need,
did
you
think
of
that?
You
are
blood
of
my
blood,
Theon,
whatever
else
you
may
be.
For
the
sake
of
the
mother
who
bore
us
both,
return
to
Deepwood
Motte
with
me.
Put
Winterfell
to
the
torch
and
fall
back
while
you
still
can.”

“No.”
Theon
adjusted
his
crown.
“I
took
this
castle
and
I
mean
to
hold
it.”

His
sister
looked
at
him
a
long
time.
“Then
hold
it
you
shall,”
she
said,
“for
the
rest
of
your
life.”
She
sighed.
“I
say
it
tastes
like
folly,
but
what
would
a
shy
maid
know
of
such
things?”
At
the
door
she
gave
him
one
last
mocking
smile.
“You
ought
to
know,
that’s
the
ugliest
crown
I’ve
ever
laid
eyes
on.
Did
you
make
it
yourself?”

She
left
him
fuming,
and
lingered
no
longer
than
was
needful
to
feed
and
water
her
horses.
Half
the
men
she’d
brought
returned
with
her
as
threatened,
riding
out
the
same
Hunter’s
Gate
that
Bran
and
Rickon
had
used
for
their
escape.

Theon
watched
them
go
from
atop
the
wall.
As
his
sister
vanished
into
the
mists
of
the
wolfswood
he
found
himself
wondering
why
he
had
not
listened
and
gone
with
her.

“Gone,
has
she?”
Reek
was
at
his
elbow.

Theon
had
not
heard
him
approach,
nor
smelled
him
either.
He
could
not
think
of
anyone
he
wanted
to
see
less.
It
made
him
uneasy
to
see
the
man
walking
around
breathing,
with
what
he
knew.
I
should
have
had
him
killed
after
he
did
the
others,
he
reflected,
but
the
notion
made
him
nervous.
Unlikely
as
it
seemed,
Reek
could
read
and
write,
and
he
was
possessed
of
enough
base
cunning
to
have
hidden
an
account
of
what
they’d
done.

“M’lord
prince,
if
you’ll
pardon
me
saying,
it’s
not
right
for
her
to
abandon
you.
And
ten
men,
that
won’t
be
near
enough.”

“I
am
well
aware
of
that,”
Theon
said.
So
was
Asha.

“Well,
might
be
I
could
help
you,”
said
Reek.
“Give
me
a
horse
and
bag
o’
coin,
and
I
could
find
you
some
good
fellows.”

Theon
narrowed
his
eyes.
“How
many?”

“A
hundred,
might
be.
Two
hundred.
Maybe
more.”
He
smiled,
his
pale
eyes
glinting.
“I
was
born
up
north
here.
I
know
many
a
man,
and
many
a
man
knows
Reek.”

Two
hundred
men
were
not
an
army,
but
you
didn’t
need
thousands
to
hold
a
castle
as
strong
as
Winterfell.
So
long
as
they
could
learn
which
end
of
a
spear
did
the
killing,
they
might
make
all
the
difference.
“Do
as
you
say
and
you’ll
not
find
me
ungrateful.
You
can
name
your
own
reward.”

“Well,
m’lord,
I
haven’t
had
no
woman
since
I
was
with
Lord
Ramsay,”
Reek
said.
“I’ve
had
my
eye
on
that
Palla,
and
I
hear
she’s
already
been
had,
so…”

He
had
gone
too
far
with
Reek
to
turn
back
now.
“Two
hundred
men
and
she’s
yours.
But
a
man
less
and
you
can
go
back
to
fucking
pigs.”

Reek
was
gone
before
the
sun
went
down,
carrying
a
bag
of
Stark
silver
and
the
last
of
Theon’s
hopes.
Like
as
not,
I’ll
never
see
the
wretch
again,
he
thought
bitterly,
but
even
so
the
chance
had
to
be
taken.

That
night
he
dreamed
of
the
feast
Ned
Stark
had
thrown
when
King
Robert
came
to
Winterfell.
The
hall
rang
with
music
and
laughter,
though
the
cold
winds
were
rising
outside.
At
first
it
was
all
wine
and
roast
meat,
and
Theon
was
making
japes
and
eyeing
the
serving
girls
and
having
himself
a
fine
time…
until
he
noticed
that
the
room
was
growing
darker.
The
music
did
not
seem
so
jolly
then;
he
heard
discords
and
strange
silences,
and
notes
that
hung
in
the
air
bleeding.
Suddenly
the
wine
turned
bitter
in
his
mouth,
and
when
he
looked
up
from
his
cup
he
saw
that
he
was
dining
with
the
dead.

King
Robert
sat
with
his
guts
spilling
out
on
the
table
from
the
great
gash
in
his
belly,
and
Lord
Eddard
was
headless
beside
him.
Corpses
lined
the
benches
below,
grey-brown
flesh
sloughing
off
their
bones
as
they
raised
their
cups
to
toast,
worms
crawling
in
and
out
of
the
holes
that
were
their
eyes.
He
knew
them,
every
one;
Jory
Cassel
and
Fat
Tom,
Porther
and
Cayn
and
Hullen
the
master
of
horse,
and
all
the
others
who
had
ridden
south
to
King’s
Landing
never
to
return.
Mikken
and
Chayle
sat
together,
one
dripping
blood
and
the
other
water.
Benfred
Tallhart
and
his
Wild
Hares
filled
most
of
a
table.
The
miller’s
wife
was
there
as
well,
and
Farlen,
even
the
wildling
Theon
had
killed
in
the
wolfswood
the
day
he
had
saved
Bran’s
life.

But
there
were
others
with
faces
he
had
never
known
in
life,
faces
he
had
seen
only
in
stone.
The
slim,
sad
girl
who
wore
a
crown
of
pale
blue
roses
and
a
white
gown
spattered
with
gore
could
only
be
Lyanna.
Her
brother
Brandon
stood
beside
her,
and
their
father
Lord
Rickard
just
behind.
Along
the
walls
figures
half-seen
moved
through
the
shadows,
pale
shades
with
long
grim
faces.
The
sight
of
them
sent
fear
shivering
through
Theon
sharp
as
a
knife.
And
then
the
tall
doors
opened
with
a
crash,
and
a
freezing
gale
blew
down
the
hall,
and
Robb
came
walking
out
of
the
night.
Grey
Wind
stalked
beside,
eyes
burning,
and
man
and
wolf
alike
bled
from
half
a
hundred
savage
wounds.

Theon
woke
with
a
scream,
startling
Wex
so
badly
that
the
boy
ran
naked
from
the
room.
When
his
guards
burst
in
with
drawn
swords,
he
ordered
them
to
bring
him
the
maester.
By
the
time
Luwin
arrived
rumpled
and
sleepy,
a
cup
of
wine
had
steadied
Theon’s
hands,
and
he
was
feeling
ashamed
of
his
panic.
“A
dream,”
he
muttered,
“that
was
all
it
was.
It
meant
nothing.”

“Nothing,”
Luwin
agreed
solemnly.
He
left
a
sleeping
draught,
but
Theon
poured
it
down
the
privy
shaft
the
moment
he
was
gone.
Luwin
was
a
man
as
well
as
a
maester,
and
the
man
had
no
love
for
him.
He
wants
me
to
sleep,
yes…
to
sleep
and
never
wake.
He’d
like
that
as
much
as
Asha
would.

He
sent
for
Kyra,
kicked
shut
the
door,
climbed
on
top
of
her,
and
fucked
the
wench
with
a
fury
he’d
never
known
was
in
him,
By
the
time
he
finished,
she
was
sobbing,
her
neck
and
breasts
covered
with
bruises
and
bite
marks.
Theon
shoved
her
from
the
bed
and
threw
her
a
blanket.
“Get
out.”

Yet
even
then,
he
could
not
sleep.

Come
dawn,
he
dressed
and
went
outside,
to
walk
along
the
outer
walls.
A
brisk
autumn
wind
was
swirling
through
the
battlements.
It
reddened
his
cheeks
and
stung
his
eyes.
He
watched
the
forest
go
from
grey
to
green
below
him
as
light
filtered
through
the
silent
trees.
On
his
left
he
could
see
tower
tops
above
the
inner
wall,
their
roofs
gilded
by
the
rising
sun.
The
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
were
a
blaze
of
flame
among
the
green.
Ned
Stark’s
tree,
he
thought,
and
Stark’s
wood,
Stark’s
castle,
Stark’s
sword,
Stark’s
gods.
This
is
their
place,
not
mine.
I
am
a
Greyjoy
of
Pyke,
born
to
paint
a
kraken
on
my
shield
and
sail
the
great
salt
sea.
I
should
have
gone
with
Asha.

On
their
iron
spikes
atop
the
gatehouse,
the
heads
waited.

Theon
gazed
at
them
silently
while
the
wind
tugged
on
his
cloak
with
small
ghostly
hands.
The
miller’s
boys
had
been
of
an
age
with
Bran
and
Rickon,
alike
in
size
and
coloring,
and
once
Reek
had
flayed
the
skin
from
their
faces
and
dipped
their
heads
in
tar,
it
was
easy
to
see
familiar
features
in
those
misshapen
lumps
of
rotting
flesh.
People
were
such
fools.
If
we’d
said
they
were
rams’
heads,
they
would
have
seen
horns.





SANSA

They
had
been
singing
in
the
sept
all
morning,
since
the
first
report
of
enemy
sails
had
reached
the
castle.
The
sound
of
their
voices
mingled
with
the
whicker
of
horses,
the
clank
of
steel,
and
the
groaning
hinges
of
the
great
bronze
gates
to
make
a
strange
and
fearful
music.
In
the
sept
they
sing
for
the
Mother’s
mercy
but
on
the
walls
it’s
the
Warrior
they
pray
to,
and
all
in
silence.
She
remembered
how
Septa
Mordane
used
to
tell
them
that
the
Warrior
and
the
Mother
were
only
two
faces
of
the
same
great
god.
But
if
there
is
only
one,
whose
prayers
will
be
heard?

Ser
Meryn
Trant
held
the
blood
bay
for
Joffrey
to
mount.
Boy
and
horse
alike
wore
gilded
mail
and
enameled
crimson
plate,
with
matching
golden
lions
on
their
heads.
The
pale
sunlight
flashed
off
the
golds
and
reds
every
time
Joff
moved.
Bright,
shining,
and
empty,
Sansa
thought.

The
Imp
was
mounted
on
a
red
stallion,
armored
more
plainly
than
the
king
in
battle
gear
that
made
him
look
like
a
little
boy
dressed
up
in
his
father’s
clothes.
But
there
was
nothing
childish
about
the
battle-axe
slung
below
his
shield.
Ser
Mandon
Moore
rode
at
his
side,
white
steel
icy
bright.
When
Tyrion
saw
her
he
turned
his
horse
her
way.
“Lady
Sansa,”
he
called
from
the
saddle,
“surely
my
sister
has
asked
you
to
join
the
other
highborn
ladies
in
Maegor’s?”

“She
has,
my
lord,
but
King
Joffrey
sent
for
me
to
see
him
off.
I
mean
to
visit
the
sept
as
well,
to
pray.”

“I
won’t
ask
for
whom.”
His
mouth
twisted
oddly;
if
that
was
a
smile,
it
was
the
queerest
she
had
ever
seen.
“This
day
may
change
all.
For
you
as
well
as
for
House
Lannister.
I
ought
to
have
sent
you
off
with
Tommen,
now
that
I
think
on
it.
Still,
you
should
be
safe
enough
in
Maegor’s,
so
long
as—”

“Sansa!”
The
boyish
shout
rang
across
the
yard;
Joffrey
had
seen
her.
“Sansa,
here!”

He
calls
me
as
if
he
were
calling
a
dog,
she
thought.

“His
Grace
has
need
of
you,”
Tyrion
Lannister
observed.
“We’ll
talk
again
after
the
battle,
if
the
gods
permit.”

Sansa
threaded
her
way
through
the
file
of
gold-cloaked
spearmen
as
Joffrey
beckoned
her
closer.
“It
will
be
battle
soon,
everyone
says
so.”

“May
the
gods
have
mercy
on
us
all.”

“My
uncle’s
the
one
who
will
need
mercy,
but
I
won’t
give
him
any.”
Joffrey
drew
his
sword.
The
pommel
was
a
ruby
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
heart,
set
between
a
lion’s
jaws.
Three
fullers
were
deeply
incised
in
the
blade.
“My
new
blade,
Hearteater.”

He’d
owned
a
sword
named
Lion’s
Tooth
once,
Sansa
remembered.
Arya
had
taken
it
from
him
and
thrown
it
in
a
river.
I
hope
Stannis
does
the
same
with
this
one.
“It
is
beautifully
wrought,
Your
Grace.”

“Bless
my
steel
with
a
kiss.”
He
extended
the
blade
down
to
her.
“Go
on,
kiss
it.”

He
had
never
sounded
more
like
a
stupid
little
boy.
Sansa
touched
her
lips
to
the
metal,
thinking
that
she
would
kiss
any
number
of
swords
sooner
than
Joffrey.
The
gesture
seemed
to
please
him,
though.
He
sheathed
the
blade
with
a
flourish.
“You’ll
kiss
it
again
when
I
return,
and
taste
my
uncle’s
blood.”

Only
if
one
of
your
Kingsguard
kills
him
for
you.
Three
of
the
White
Swords
would
go
with
Joffrey
and
his
uncle:
Ser
Meryn,
Ser
Mandon,
and
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack.
“Will
you
lead
your
knights
into
battle?”
Sansa
asked,
hoping.

“I
would,
but
my
uncle
the
Imp
says
my
uncle
Stannis
will
never
cross
the
river.
I’ll
command
the
Three
Whores,
though.
I’m
going
to
see
to
the
traitors
myself.”
The
prospect
made
Joff
smile.
His
plump
pink
lips
always
made
him
look
pouty.
Sansa
had
liked
that
once,
but
now
it
made
her
sick.

“They
say
my
brother
Robb
always
goes
where
the
fighting
is
thickest,”
she
said
recklessly.
“Though
he’s
older
than
Your
Grace,
to
be
sure.
A
man
grown.”

That
made
him
frown.
“I’ll
deal
with
your
brother
after
I’m
done
with
my
traitor
uncle.
I’ll
gut
him
with
Hearteater,
you’ll
see.”
He
wheeled
his
horse
about
and
spurred
toward
the
gate.
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Osmund
fell
in
to
his
right
and
left,
the
gold
cloaks
following
four
abreast.
The
Imp
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
brought
up
the
rear.
The
guards
saw
them
off
with
off
with
shouts
and
cheers.
When
the
last
was
gone,
a
sudden
stillness
settled
over
the
yard,
like
the
hush
before
a
storm.

Through
the
quiet,
the
singing
pulled
at
her.
Sansa
turned
toward
the
sept.
Two
stableboys
followed,
and
one
of
the
guards
whose
watch
was
ended.
Others
fell
in
behind
them.

Sansa
had
never
seen
the
sept
so
crowded,
nor
so
brightly
lit;
great
shafts
of
rainbow-colored
sunlight
slanted
down
through
the
crystals
in
the
high
windows,
and
candles
burned
on
every
side,
their
little
flames
twinkling
like
stars.
The
Mother’s
altar
and
the
Warrior’s
swam
in
light,
but
Smith
and
Crone
and
Maid
and
Father
had
their
worshipers
as
well,
and
there
were
even
a
few
flames
dancing
below
the
Stranger’s
half-human
face…
for
what
was
Stannis
Baratheon,
if
not
the
Stranger
come
to
judge
them?
Sansa
visited
each
of
the
Seven
in
turn,
lighting
a
candle
at
each
altar,
and
then
found
herself
a
place
on
the
benches
between
a
wizened
old
washer
woman
and
a
boy
no
older
than
Rickon,
dressed
in
the
fine
linen
tunic
of
a
knight’s
son.
The
old
woman’s
hand
was
bony
and
hard
with
callus,
the
boy’s
small
and
soft,
but
it
was
good
to
have
someone
to
hold
on
to.
The
air
was
hot
and
heavy,
smelling
of
incense
and
sweat,
crystal-kissed
and
candle-bright;
it
made
her
dizzy
to
breathe
it.

She
knew
the
hymn;
her
mother
had
taught
it
to
her
once,
a
long
time
ago
in
Winterfell.
She
joined
her
voice
to
theirs.

Gentle
Mother,
font
of
mercy,

save
our
sons
from
war,
we
pray,

stay
the
swords
and
stay
the
arrows,

let
them
know
a
better
day.

Gentle
Mother,
strength
of
women,

help
our
daughters
through
this
fray,

soothe
the
wrath
and
tame
the
fury,

teach
us
all
a
kinder
way.

Across
the
city,
thousands
had
jammed
into
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
Visenya’s
Hill,
and
they
would
be
singing
too,
their
voices
swelling
out
over
the
city,
across
the
river,
and
up
into
the
sky.
Surely
the
gods
must
hear
us,
she
thought.

Sansa
knew
most
of
the
hymns,
and
followed
along
on
those
she
did
not
know
as
best
she
could.
She
sang
along
with
grizzled
old
serving
men
and
anxious
young
wives,
with
serving
girls
and
soldiers,
cooks
and
falconers,
knights
and
knaves,
squires
and
spit
boys
and
nursing
mothers.
She
sang
with
those
inside
the
castle
walls
and
those
without,
sang
with
all
the
city.
She
sang
for
mercy,
for
the
living
and
the
dead
alike,
for
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb,
for
her
sister
Arya
and
her
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow,
away
off
on
the
Wall.
She
sang
for
her
mother
and
her
father,
for
her
grandfather
Lord
Hoster
and
her
uncle
Edmure
Tully,
for
her
friend
Jeyne
Poole,
for
old
drunken
King
Robert,
for
Septa
Mordane
and
Ser
Dontos
and
Jory
Cassel
and
Maester
Luwin,
for
all
the
brave
knights
and
soldiers
who
would
die
today,
and
for
the
children
and
the
wives
who
would
mourn
them,
and
finally,
toward
the
end,
she
even
sang
for
Tyrion
the
Imp
and
for
the
Hound.
He
is
no
true
knight
but
he
saved
me
all
the
same,
she
told
the
Mother.
Save
him
if
you
can,
and
gentle
the
rage
inside
him.

But
when
the
septon
climbed
on
high
and
called
upon
the
gods
to
protect
and
defend
their
true
and
noble
king,
Sansa
got
to
her
feet.
The
aisles
were
jammed
with
people.
She
had
to
shoulder
through
while
the
septon
called
upon
the
Smith
to
lend
strength
to
Joffrey’s
sword
and
shield,
the
Warrior
to
give
him
courage,
the
Father
to
defend
him
in
his
need.
Let
his
sword
break
and
his
shield
shatter,
Sansa
thought
coldly
as
she
shoved
out
through
the
doors,
let
his
courage
fail
him
and
every
man
desert
him.

A
few
guards
paced
along
on
the
gatehouse
battlements,
but
otherwise
the
castle
seemed
empty.
Sansa
stopped
and
listened.
Away
off,
she
could
hear
the
sounds
of
battle.
The
singing
almost
drowned
them
out,
but
the
sounds
were
there
if
you
had
the
ears
to
hear:
the
deep
moan
of
warhorns,
the
creak
and
thud
of
catapults
flinging
stones,
the
splashes
and
splinterings,
the
crackle
of
burning
pitch
and
thrum
of
scorpions
loosing
their
yard-long
iron-headed
shafts…
and
beneath
it
all,
the
cries
of
dying
men.

It
was
another
sort
of
song,
a
terrible
song.
Sansa
pulled
the
hood
of
her
cloak
up
over
her
ears,
and
hurried
toward
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
the
castle-within-a-castle
where
the
queen
had
promised
they
would
all
be
safe.
At
the
foot
of
the
drawbridge,
she
came
upon
Lady
Tanda
and
her
two
daughters.
Falyse
had
arrived
yesterday
from
Castle
Stokeworth
with
a
small
troop
of
soldiers.
She
was
trying
to
coax
her
sister
onto
the
bridge,
but
Lollys
clung
to
her
maid,
sobbing,
“I
don’t
want
to,
I
don’t
want
to,
I
don’t
want
to.”

“The
battle
is
begun,”
Lady
Tanda
said
in
a
brittle
voice.

“I
don’t
want
to,
I
don’t
want
to.”

There
was
no
way
Sansa
could
avoid
them.
She
greeted
them
courteously.
“May
I
be
of
help?”

Lady
Tanda
flushed
with
shame.
“No,
my
lady,
but
we
thank
you
kindly.
You
must
forgive
my
daughter,
she
has
not
been
well.”

“I
don’t
want
to.”
Lollys
clutched
at
her
maid,
a
slender,
pretty
girl
with
short
dark
hair
who
looked
as
though
she
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
shove
her
mistress
into
the
dry
moat,
onto
those
iron
spikes.
“Please,
please,
I
don’t
want
to.”

Sansa
spoke
to
her
gently.
“We’ll
all
be
thrice
protected
inside,
and
there’s
to
be
food
and
drink
and
song
as
well.”

Lollys
gaped
at
her,
mouth
open.
She
had
dull
brown
eyes
that
always
seemed
to
be
wet
with
tears.
“I
don’t
want
to.”

“You
have
to,”
her
sister
Falyse
said
sharply,
“and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
Shae,
help
me.”
They
each
took
an
elbow,
and
together
half
dragged
and
half
carried
Lollys
across
the
bridge.
Sansa
followed
with
their
mother.
“She’s
been
sick,”
Lady
Tanda
said.
If
a
babe
can
be
termed
a
sickness,
Sansa
thought.
It
was
common
gossip
that
Lollys
was
with
child.

The
two
guards
at
the
door
wore
the
lion-crested
helms
and
crimson
cloaks
of
House
Lannister,
but
Sansa
knew
they
were
only
dressed-up
sellswords.
Another
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
stair—a
real
guard
would
have
been
standing,
not
sitting
on
a
step
with
his
halberd
across
his
knees—but
he
rose
when
he
saw
them
and
opened
the
door
to
usher
them
inside.

The
Queen’s
Ballroom
was
not
a
tenth
the
size
of
the
castle’s
Great
Hall,
only
half
as
big
as
the
Small
Hall
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
it
could
still
seat
a
hundred,
and
it
made
up
in
grace
what
it
lacked
in
space.
Beaten
silver
mirrors
backed
every
wall
sconce,
so
the
torches
burned
twice
as
bright;
the
walls
were
paneled
in
richly
carved
wood,
and
sweet-smelling
rushes
covered
the
floors.
From
the
gallery
above
drifted
down
the
merry
strains
of
pipes
and
fiddle.
A
line
of
arched
windows
ran
along
the
south
wall,
but
they
had
been
closed
off
with
heavy
draperies.
Thick
velvet
hangings
admitted
no
thread
of
light,
and
would
muffle
the
sound
of
prayer
and
war
alike.
It
makes
no
matter,
Sansa
thought.
The
war
is
with
us.

Almost
every
highborn
woman
in
the
city
sat
at
the
long
trestle
tables,
along
with
a
handful
of
old
men
and
young
boys.
The
women
were
wives,
daughters,
mothers,
and
sisters.
Their
men
had
gone
out
to
fight
Lord
Stannis.
Many
would
not
return.
The
air
was
heavy
with
the
knowledge.
As
Joffrey’s
betrothed,
Sansa
had
the
seat
of
honor
on
the
queen’s
right
hand.
She
was
climbing
the
dais
when
she
saw
the
man
standing
in
the
shadows
by
the
back
wall.
He
wore
a
long
hauberk
of
oiled
black
mail,
and
held
his
sword
before
him:
her
father’s
greatsword,
Ice,
near
as
tall
as
he
was.
Its
point
rested
on
the
floor,
and
his
hard
bony
fingers
curled
around
the
crossguard
on
either
side
of
the
grip.
Sansa’s
breath
caught
in
her
throat.
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
seemed
to
sense
her
stare.
He
turned
his
gaunt,
pox-ravaged
face
toward
her.

“What
is
he
doing
here?”
she
asked
Osfryd
Kettleblack.
He
captained
the
queen’s
new
red
cloak
guard.

Osfryd
grinned.
“Her
Grace
expects
she’ll
have
need
of
him
before
the
night’s
done.”

Ser
Ilyn
was
the
King’s
Justice.
There
was
only
one
service
he
might
be
needed
for.
Whose
head
does
she
want?

“All
rise
for
Her
Grace,
Cersei
of
House
Lannister,
Queen
Regent
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,”
the
royal
steward
cried.

Cersei’s
gown
was
snowy
linen,
white
as
the
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard.
Her
long
dagged
sleeves
showed
a
lining
of
gold
satin.
Masses
of
bright
yellow
hair
tumbled
to
her
bare
shoulders
in
thick
curls.
Around
her
slender
neck
hung
a
rope
of
diamonds
and
emeralds.
The
white
made
her
look
strangely
innocent,
almost
maidenly,
but
there
were
points
of
color
on
her
cheeks.

“Be
seated,”
the
queen
said
when
she
had
taken
her
place
on
the
dais,
“and
be
welcome.”
Osfryd
Kettleblack
held
her
chair;
a
page
performed
the
same
service
for
Sansa.
“You
look
pale,
Sansa,”
Cersei
observed.
“Is
your
red
flower
still
blooming?”

“Yes.”

“How
apt.
The
men
will
bleed
out
there,
and
you
in
here.”
The
queen
signaled
for
the
first
course
to
be
served.

“Why
is
Ser
Ilyn
here?”
Sansa
blurted
out.

The
queen
glanced
at
the
mute
headsman.
“To
deal
with
treason,
and
to
defend
us
if
need
be.
He
was
a
knight
before
he
was
a
headsman.”
She
pointed
her
spoon
toward
the
end
of
the
hall,
where
the
tall
wooden
doors
had
been
closed
and
barred.
“When
the
axes
smash
down
those
doors,
you
may
be
glad
of
him.”

I
would
be
gladder
if
it
were
the
Hound,
Sansa
thought.
Harsh
as
he
was,
she
did
not
believe
Sandor
Clegane
would
let
any
harm
come
to
her.
“Won’t
your
guards
protect
us?”

“And
who
will
protect
us
from
my
guards?”
The
queen
gave
Osfryd
a
sideways
look.
“Loyal
sellswords
are
rare
as
virgin
whores.
If
the
battle
is
lost
my
guards
will
trip
on
those
crimson
cloaks
in
their
haste
to
rip
them
off.
They’ll
steal
what
they
can
and
flee,
along
with
the
serving
men,
washer
women,
and
stableboys,
all
out
to
save
their
own
worthless
hides.
Do
you
have
any
notion
what
happens
when
a
city
is
sacked,
Sansa?
No,
you
wouldn’t,
would
you?
All
you
know
of
life
you
learned
from
singers,
and
there’s
such
a
dearth
of
good
sacking
songs.”

“True
knights
would
never
harm
women
and
children.”
The
words
rang
hollow
in
her
ears
even
as
she
said
them.

“True
knights.”
The
queen
seemed
to
find
that
wonderfully
amusing.
“No
doubt
you’re
right.
So
why
don’t
you
just
eat
your
broth
like
a
good
girl
and
wait
for
Symeon
Star-Eyes
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
to
come
rescue
you,
sweetling.
I’m
sure
it
won’t
be
very
long
now.”





DAVOS

Blackwater
Bay
was
rough
and
choppy,
whitecaps
everywhere.
Black
Betha
rode
the
flood
tide,
her
sail
cracking
and
snapping
at
each
shift
of
wind.
Wraith
and
Lady
Marya
sailed
beside
her,
no
more
than
twenty
yards
between
their
hulls.
His
sons
could
keep
a
line.
Davos
took
pride
in
that.

Across
the
sea
warhorns
boomed,
deep
throaty
moans
like
the
calls
of
monstrous
serpents,
repeated
ship
to
ship.
“Bring
down
the
sail,”
Davos
commanded.
“Lower
mast.
Oarsmen
to
your
oars.”
His
son
Matthos
relayed
the
commands.
The
deck
of
Black
Betha
churned
as
crewmen
ran
to
their
tasks,
pushing
through
the
soldiers
who
always
seemed
to
be
in
the
way
no
matter
where
they
stood.
Ser
Imry
had
decreed
that
they
would
enter
the
river
on
oars
alone,
so
as
not
to
expose
their
sails
to
the
scorpions
and
spitfires
on
the
walls
of
King’s
Landing.

Davos
could
make
out
Fury
well
to
the
southeast,
her
sails
shimmering
golden
as
they
came
down,
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
blazoned
on
the
canvas.
From
her
decks
Stannis
Baratheon
had
commanded
the
assault
on
Dragonstone
sixteen
years
before,
but
this
time
he
had
chosen
to
ride
with
his
army,
trusting
Fury
and
the
command
of
his
fleet
to
his
wife’s
brother
Ser
Imry,
who’d
come
over
to
his
cause
at
Storm’s
End
with
Lord
Alester
and
all
the
other
Florents.

Davos
knew
Fury
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
ships.
Above
her
three
hundred
oars
was
a
deck
given
over
wholly
to
scorpions,
and
topside
she
mounted
catapults
fore
and
aft,
large
enough
to
fling
barrels
of
burning
pitch.
A
most
formidable
ship,
and
very
swift
as
well,
although
Ser
Imry
had
packed
her
bow
to
stern
with
armored
knights
and
men-at-arms,
at
some
cost
to
her
speed.

The
warhorns
sounded
again,
commands
drifting
back
from
the
Fury.
Davos
felt
a
tingle
in
his
missing
fingertips.
“Out
oars,”
he
shouted.
“Form
line.”
A
hundred
blades
dipped
down
into
the
water
as
the
oarmaster’s
drum
began
to
boom.
The
sound
was
like
the
beating
of
a
great
slow
heart,
and
the
oars
moved
at
every
stroke,
a
hundred
men
pulling
as
one.

Wooden
wings
had
sprouted
from
the
Wraith
and
Lady
Marya
as
well.
The
three
galleys
kept
pace,
their
blades
churning
the
water.
“Slow
cruise,”
Davos
called.
Lord
Velaryon’s
silver-hulled
Pride
of
Driftmark
had
moved
into
her
position
to
port
of
Wraith,
and
Bold
Laughter
was
coming
up
fast,
but
Harridan
was
only
now
getting
her
oars
into
the
water
and
Seahorse
was
still
struggling
to
bring
down
her
mast.
Davos
looked
astern.
Yes,
there,
far
to
the
south,
that
could
only
be
Swordfish,
lagging
as
ever.
She
dipped
two
hundred
oars
and
mounted
the
largest
ram
in
the
fleet,
though
Davos
had
grave
doubts
about
her
captain.

He
could
hear
soldiers
shouting
encouragement
to
each
other
across
the
water.
They’d
been
little
more
than
ballast
since
Storm’s
End,
and
were
eager
to
get
at
the
foe,
confident
of
victory.
In
that,
they
were
of
one
mind
with
their
admiral,
Lord
High
Captain
Ser
Imry
Florent.

Three
days
past,
he
had
summoned
all
his
captains
to
a
war
council
aboard
the
Fury
while
the
fleet
lay
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
the
Wendwater,
in
order
to
acquaint
them
with
his
dispositions.
Davos
and
his
sons
had
been
assigned
a
place
in
the
second
line
of
battle,
well
out
on
the
dangerous
starboard
wing.
“A
place
of
honor,”
Allard
had
declared,
well
satisfied
with
the
chance
to
prove
his
valor.
“A
place
of
peril,”
his
father
had
pointed
out.
His
sons
had
given
him
pitying
looks,
even
young
Maric.
The
Onion
Knight
has
become
an
old
woman,
he
could
hear
them
thinking,
still
a
smuggler
at
heart.

Well,
the
last
was
true
enough,
he
would
make
no
apologies
for
it.
Seaworth
had
a
lordly
ring
to
it,
but
down
deep
he
was
still
Davos
of
Flea
Bottom,
coming
home
to
his
city
on
its
three
high
hills.
He
knew
as
much
of
ships
and
sails
and
shores
as
any
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
had
fought
his
share
of
desperate
fights
sword
to
sword
on
a
wet
deck.
But
to
this
sort
of
battle
he
came
a
maiden,
nervous
and
afraid.
Smugglers
do
not
sound
warhorns
and
raise
banners.
When
they
smell
danger,
they
raise
sail
and
run
before
the
wind.

Had
he
been
admiral,
he
might
have
done
it
all
differently.
For
a
start,
he
would
have
sent
a
few
of
his
swiftest
ships
to
probe
upriver
and
see
what
awaited
them,
instead
of
smashing
in
headlong.
When
he
had
suggested
as
much
to
Ser
Imry,
the
Lord
High
Captain
had
thanked
him
courteously,
but
his
eyes
were
not
as
polite.
Who
is
this
lowborn
craven?
those
eyes
asked.
Is
he
the
one
who
bought
his
knighthood
with
an
onion?

With
four
times
as
many
ships
as
the
boy
king,
Ser
Imry
saw
no
need
for
caution
or
deceptive
tactics.
He
had
organized
the
fleet
into
ten
lines
of
battle,
each
of
twenty
ships.
The
first
two
lines
would
sweep
up
the
river
to
engage
and
destroy
Joffrey’s
little
fleet,
or
“the
boy’s
toys”
as
Ser
Imry
dubbed
them,
to
the
mirth
of
his
lordly
captains.
Those
that
followed
would
land
companies
of
archers
and
spearmen
beneath
the
city
walls,
and
only
then
join
the
fight
on
the
river.
The
smaller,
slower
ships
to
the
rear
would
ferry
over
the
main
part
of
Stannis’s
host
from
the
south
bank,
protected
by
Salladhor
Saan
and
his
Lyseni,
who
would
stand
out
in
the
bay
in
case
the
Lannisters
had
other
ships
hidden
up
along
the
coast,
poised
to
sweep
down
on
their
rear.

To
be
fair,
there
was
reason
for
Ser
Imry’s
haste.
The
winds
had
not
used
them
kindly
on
the
voyage
up
from
Storm’s
End.
They
had
lost
two
cogs
to
the
rocks
of
Shipbreaker
Bay
on
the
very
day
they
set
sail,
a
poor
way
to
begin.
One
of
the
Myrish
galleys
had
foundered
in
the
Straits
of
Tarth,
and
a
storm
had
overtaken
them
as
they
were
entering
the
Gullet,
scattering
the
fleet
across
half
the
narrow
sea.
All
but
twelve
ships
had
finally
regrouped
behind
the
sheltering
spine
of
Massey’s
Hook,
in
the
calmer
waters
of
Blackwater
Bay,
but
not
before
they
had
lost
considerable
time.

Stannis
would
have
reached
the
Rush
days
ago.
The
kingsroad
ran
from
Storm’s
End
straight
to
King’s
Landing,
a
much
shorter
route
than
by
sea,
and
his
host
was
largely
mounted;
near
twenty
thousand
knights,
light
horse,
and
freeriders,
Renly’s
unwilling
legacy
to
his
brother.
They
would
have
made
good
time,
but
armored
destriers
and
twelve-foot
lances
would
avail
them
little
against
the
deep
waters
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
and
the
high
stone
walls
of
the
city.
Stannis
would
be
camped
with
his
lords
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river,
doubtless
seething
with
impatience
and
wondering
what
Ser
Imry
had
done
with
his
fleet.

Off
Merling
Rock
two
days
before,
they
had
sighted
a
half-dozen
fishing
skiffs.
The
fisherfolk
had
fled
before
them,
but
one
by
one
they
had
been
overtaken
and
boarded.
“A
small
spoon
of
victory
is
just
the
thing
to
settle
the
stomach
before
battle,”
Ser
Imry
had
declared
happily.
“It
makes
the
men
hungry
for
a
larger
helping.”
But
Davos
had
been
more
interested
in
what
the
captives
had
to
say
about
the
defenses
at
King’s
Landing.
The
dwarf
had
been
busy
building
some
sort
of
boom
to
close
off
the
mouth
of
the
river,
though
the
fishermen
differed
as
to
whether
the
work
had
been
completed
or
not.
He
found
himself
wishing
it
had.
If
the
river
was
closed
to
them,
Ser
Imry
would
have
no
choice
but
to
pause
and
take
stock.

The
sea
was
full
of
sound:
shouts
and
calls,
warhorns
and
drums
and
the
trill
of
pipes,
the
slap
of
wood
on
water
as
thousands
of
oars
rose
and
fell.
“Keep
line,”
Davos
shouted.
A
gust
of
wind
tugged
at
his
old
green
cloak.
A
jerkin
of
boiled
leather
and
a
pothelm
at
his
feet
were
his
only
armor.
At
sea,
heavy
steel
was
as
like
to
cost
a
man
his
life
as
to
save
it,
he
believed.
Ser
Imry
and
the
other
highborn
captains
did
not
share
his
view;
they
glittered
as
they
paced
their
decks.

Harridan
and
Seahorse
had
slipped
into
their
places
now,
and
Lord
Celtigar’s
Red
Claw
beyond
them.
To
starboard
of
Allard’s
Lady
Marya
were
the
three
galleys
that
Stannis
had
seized
from
the
unfortunate
Lord
Sunglass,
Piety,
Prayer,
and
Devotion,
their
decks
crawling
with
archers.
Even
Swordfish
was
closing,
lumbering
and
rolling
through
a
thickening
sea
under
both
oars
and
sail.
A
ship
of
that
many
oars
ought
to
be
much
faster,
Davos
reflected
with
disapproval.
It’s
that
ram
she
carries,
it’s
too
big,
she
has
no
balance.

The
wind
was
gusting
from
the
south,
but
under
oars
it
made
no
matter.
They
would
be
sweeping
in
on
the
flood
tide,
but
the
Lannisters
would
have
the
river
current
to
their
favor,
and
the
Blackwater
Rush
flowed
strong
and
swift
where
it
met
the
sea.
The
first
shock
would
inevitably
favor
the
foe.
We
are
fools
to
meet
them
on
the
Blackwater,
Davos
thought.
In
any
encounter
on
the
open
sea,
their
battle
lines
would
envelop
the
enemy
fleet
on
both
flanks,
driving
them
inward
to
destruction.
On
the
river,
though,
the
numbers
and
weight
of
Ser
Imry’s
ships
would
count
for
less.
They
could
not
dress
more
than
twenty
ships
abreast,
lest
they
risk
tangling
their
oars
and
colliding
with
each
other.

Beyond
the
line
of
warships,
Davos
could
see
the
Red
Keep
up
on
Aegon’s
High
Hill,
dark
against
a
lemon
sky,
with
the
mouth
of
the
Rush
opening
out
below.
Across
the
river
the
south
shore
was
black
with
men
and
horses,
stirring
like
angry
ants
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
approaching
ships.
Stannis
would
have
kept
them
busy
building
rafts
and
fletching
arrows,
yet
even
so
the
waiting
would
have
been
a
hard
thing
to
bear.
Trumpets
sounded
from
among
them,
tiny
and
brazen,
soon
swallowed
by
the
roar
of
a
thousand
shouts.
Davos
closed
his
stubby
hand
around
the
pouch
that
held
his
fingerbones,
and
mouthed
a
silent
prayer
for
luck.

Fury
herself
would
center
the
first
line
of
battle,
flanked
by
the
Lord
Steffon
and
the
Stag
of
the
Sea,
each
of
two
hundred
oars.
On
the
port
and
starboard
wings
were
the
hundreds:
Lady
Harra,
Brightfish,
Laughing
Lord,
Sea
Demon,
Horned
Honor,
Ragged
Jenna,
Trident
Three,
Swift
Sword,
Princess
Rhaenys,
Dog’s
Nose,
Sceptre,
Faithful,
Red
Raven,
Queen
Alysanne,
Cat,
Courageous,
and
Dragonsbane.
From
every
stern
streamed
the
fiery
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light,
red
and
yellow
and
orange.
Behind
Davos
and
his
sons
came
another
line
of
hundreds
commanded
by
knights
and
lordly
captains,
and
then
the
smaller,
slower
Myrish
contingent,
none
dipping
more
than
eighty
oars.
Farther
back
would
come
the
sailed
ships,
carracks
and
lumbering
great
cogs,
and
last
of
all
Salladhor
Saan
in
his
proud
Valyrian,
a
towering
three-hundred,
paced
by
the
rest
of
his
galleys
with
their
distinctive
striped
hulls.
The
flamboyant
Lyseni
princeling
had
not
been
pleased
to
be
assigned
the
rear
guard,
but
it
was
clear
that
Ser
Imry
trusted
him
no
more
than
Stannis
did.
Too
many
complaints,
and
too
much
talk
of
the
gold
he
was
owed.
Davos
was
sorry
nonetheless.
Salladhor
Saan
was
a
resourceful
old
pirate,
and
his
crews
were
born
seamen,
fearless
in
a
fight.
They
were
wasted
in
the
rear.

Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
The
call
rolled
across
whitecaps
and
churning
oars
from
the
forecastle
of
the
Fury:
Ser
Imry
was
sounding
the
attack.
Ahoooooooooooooooooooo,
ahooooooooooooooooooooo.

Swordfish
had
joined
the
line
at
last,
though
she
still
had
her
sail
raised.
“Fast
cruise,”
Davos
barked.
The
drum
began
to
beat
more
quickly,
and
the
stroke
picked
up,
the
blades
of
the
oars
cutting
water,
splash-swoosh,
splash-swoosh,
splash-swoosh.
On
deck,
soldiers
banged
sword
against
shield,
while
archers
quietly
strung
their
bows
and
pulled
the
first
arrow
from
the
quivers
at
their
belts.
The
galleys
of
the
first
line
of
battle
obscured
his
vision,
so
Davos
paced
the
deck
searching
for
a
better
view.
He
saw
no
sign
of
any
boom;
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
open,
as
if
to
swallow
them
all.
Except…

In
his
smuggling
days,
Davos
had
often
jested
that
he
knew
the
waterfront
at
King’s
Landing
a
deal
better
than
the
back
of
his
hand,
since
he
had
not
spent
a
good
part
of
his
life
sneaking
in
and
out
of
the
back
of
his
hand.
The
squat
towers
of
raw
new
stone
that
stood
opposite
one
another
at
the
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
might
mean
nothing
to
Ser
Imry
Florent,
but
to
him
it
was
as
if
two
extra
fingers
had
sprouted
from
his
knuckles.

Shading
his
eyes
against
the
westering
sun,
he
peered
at
those
towers
more
closely.
They
were
too
small
to
hold
much
of
a
garrison.
The
one
on
the
north
bank
was
built
against
the
bluff
with
the
Red
Keep
frowning
above;
its
counterpart
on
the
south
shore
had
its
footing
in
the
water.
They
dug
a
cut
through
the
bank,
he
knew
at
once.
That
would
make
the
tower
very
difficult
to
assault;
attackers
would
need
to
wade
through
the
water
or
bridge
the
little
channel.
Stannis
had
posted
bowmen
below,
to
fire
up
at
the
defenders
whenever
one
was
rash
enough
to
lift
his
head
above
the
ramparts,
but
otherwise
had
not
troubled.

Something
flashed
down
low
where
the
dark
water
swirled
around
the
base
of
the
tower.
It
was
sunlight
on
steel,
and
it
told
Davos
Seaworth
all
he
needed
to
know.
A
chain
boom…
and
yet
they
have
not
closed
the
river
against
us.
Why?

He
could
make
a
guess
at
that
as
well,
but
there
was
no
time
to
consider
the
question.
A
shout
went
up
from
the
ships
ahead,
and
the
warhorns
blew
again:
the
enemy
was
before
them.

Between
the
flashing
oars
of
Sceptre
and
Faithful,
Davos
saw
a
thin
line
of
galleys
drawn
across
the
river,
the
sun
glinting
off
the
gold
paint
that
marked
their
hulls.
He
knew
those
ships
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own.
When
he
had
been
a
smuggler,
he’d
always
felt
safer
knowing
whether
the
sail
on
the
horizon
marked
a
fast
ship
or
a
slow
one,
and
whether
her
captain
was
a
young
man
hungry
for
glory
or
an
old
one
serving
out
his
days.

Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,
the
warhorns
called.
“Battle
speed,”
Davos
shouted.
On
port
and
starboard
he
heard
Dale
and
Allard
giving
the
same
command.
Drums
began
to
beat
furiously,
oars
rose
and
fell,
and
Black
Betha
surged
forward.
When
he
glanced
toward
Wraith,
Dale
gave
him
a
salute.
Swordfish
was
lagging
once
more,
wallowing
in
the
wake
of
the
smaller
ships
to
either
side;
elsewise
the
line
was
straight
as
a
shield
wall.

The
river
that
had
seemed
so
narrow
from
a
distance
now
stretched
wide
as
a
sea,
but
the
city
had
grown
gigantic
as
well.
Glowering
down
from
Aegon’s
High
Hill,
the
Red
Keep
commanded
the
approaches.
Its
iron-crowned
battlements,
massive
towers,
and
thick
red
walls
gave
it
the
aspect
of
a
ferocious
beast
hunched
above
river
and
streets.
The
bluffs
on
which
it
crouched
were
steep
and
rocky,
spotted
with
lichen
and
gnarled
thorny
trees.
The
fleet
would
have
to
pass
below
the
castle
to
reach
the
harbor
and
city
beyond.

The
first
line
was
in
the
river
now,
but
the
enemy
galleys
were
backing
water.
They
mean
to
draw
us
in.
They
want
us
jammed
close,
constricted,
no
way
to
sweep
around
their
flanks…
and
with
that
boom
behind
us.
He
paced
his
deck,
craning
his
neck
for
a
better
look
at
Joffrey’s
fleet.
The
boy’s
toys
included
the
ponderous
Godsgrace,
he
saw,
the
old
slow
Prince
Aemon,
the
Lady
of
Silk
and
her
sister
Lady’s
Shame,
Wildwind,
Kingslander,
White
Hart,
Lance,
Seaflower.
But
where
was
the
Lionstar?
Where
was
the
beautiful
Lady
Lyanna
that
King
Robert
had
named
in
honor
of
the
maid
he’d
loved
and
lost?
And
where
was
King
Robert’s
Hammer?
She
was
the
largest
war
galley
in
the
royal
fleet,
four
hundred
oars,
the
only
warship
the
boy
king
owned
capable
of
overmatching
Fury.
By
rights
she
should
have
formed
the
heart
of
any
defense.

Davos
tasted
a
trap,
yet
he
saw
no
sign
of
any
foes
sweeping
in
behind
them,
only
the
great
fleet
of
Stannis
Baratheon
in
their
ordered
ranks,
stretching
back
to
the
watery
horizon.
Will
they
raise
the
chain
and
cut
us
in
two?
He
could
not
see
what
good
that
would
serve.
The
ships
left
out
in
the
bay
could
still
land
men
north
of
the
city;
a
slower
crossing,
but
safer.

A
flight
of
flickering
orange
birds
took
wing
from
the
castle,
twenty
or
thirty
of
them;
pots
of
burning
pitch,
arcing
out
over
the
river
trailing
threads
of
flame.
The
waters
ate
most,
but
a
few
found
the
decks
of
galleys
in
the
first
line
of
battle,
spreading
flame
when
they
shattered.
Men-at-arms
were
scrambling
on
Queen
Alysanne’s
deck,
and
he
could
see
smoke
rising
from
three
different
spots
on
Dragonsbane,
nearest
the
bank.
By
then
a
second
flight
was
on
its
way,
and
arrows
were
falling
as
well,
hissing
down
from
the
archers’
nests
that
studded
the
towers
above.
A
soldier
tumbled
over
Cat’s
gunwale,
crashed
off
the
oars,
and
sank.
The
first
man
to
die
today,
Davos
thought,
but
he
will
not
be
the
last.

Atop
the
Red
Keep’s
battlements
streamed
the
boy
king’s
banners:
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
on
its
gold
field,
the
lion
of
Lannister
on
crimson.
More
pots
of
pitch
came
flying.
Davos
heard
men
shriek
as
fire
spread
across
Courageous.
Her
oarsmen
were
safe
below,
protected
from
missiles
by
the
half
deck
that
sheltered
them,
but
the
men-at-arms
crowded
topside
were
not
so
fortunate.
The
starboard
wing
was
taking
all
the
damage,
as
he
had
feared.
It
will
be
our
turn
soon,
he
reminded
himself,
uneasy.
Black
Betha
was
well
in
range
of
the
firepots,
being
the
sixth
ship
out
from
the
north
bank.
To
starboard,
she
had
only
Allard’s
Lady
Marya,
the
ungainly
Swordfish—so
far
behind
now
that
she
was
nearer
the
third
line
than
the
second—and
Piety,
Prayer,
and
Devotion,
who
would
need
all
the
godly
intervention
they
could
get,
placed
as
vulnerably
as
they
were.

As
the
second
line
swept
past
the
twin
towers,
Davos
took
a
closer
look.
He
could
see
three
links
of
a
huge
chain
snaking
out
from
a
hole
no
bigger
than
a
man’s
head
and
disappearing
under
the
water.
The
towers
had
a
single
door,
set
a
good
twenty
feet
off
the
ground.
Bowmen
on
the
roof
of
the
northern
tower
were
firing
down
at
Prayer
and
Devotion.
The
archers
on
Devotion
fired
back,
and
Davos
heard
a
man
scream
as
the
arrows
found
him.

“Captain
ser.”
His
son
Matthos
was
at
his
elbow.
“Your
helm.”
Davos
took
it
with
both
hands
and
slid
it
over
his
head.
The
pothelm
was
visorless;
he
hated
having
his
vision
impeded.

By
then
the
pitch
pots
were
raining
down
around
them.
He
saw
one
shatter
on
the
deck
of
Lady
Marya,
but
Allard’s
crew
quickly
beat
it
out.
To
port,
warhorns
sounded
from
the
Pride
of
Driftmark.
The
oars
flung
up
sprays
of
water
with
every
stroke.
The
yard-long
shaft
of
a
scorpion
came
down
not
two
feet
from
Matthos
and
sank
into
the
wood
of
the
deck,
thrumming.
Ahead,
the
first
line
was
within
bowshot
of
the
enemy;
flights
of
arrows
flew
between
the
ships,
hissing
like
striking
snakes.

South
of
the
Blackwater,
Davos
saw
men
dragging
crude
rafts
toward
the
water
while
ranks
and
columns
formed
up
beneath
a
thousand
streaming
banners.
The
fiery
heart
was
everywhere,
though
the
tiny
black
stag
imprisoned
in
the
flames
was
too
small
to
make
out.
We
should
be
flying
the
crowned
stag,
he
thought.
The
stag
was
King
Robert’s
sigil,
the
city
would
rejoice
to
see
it.
This
stranger’s
standard
serves
only
to
set
men
against
us.

He
could
not
behold
the
fiery
heart
without
thinking
of
the
shadow
Melisandre
had
birthed
in
the
gloom
beneath
Storm’s
End.
At
least
we
fight
this
battle
in
the
light,
with
the
weapons
of
honest
men,
he
told
himself.
The
red
woman
and
her
dark
children
would
have
no
part
of
it.
Stannis
had
shipped
her
back
to
Dragonstone
with
his
bastard
nephew
Edric
Storm.
His
captains
and
bannermen
had
insisted
that
a
battlefield
was
no
place
for
a
woman.
Only
the
queen’s
men
had
dissented,
and
then
not
loudly.
All
the
same,
the
king
had
been
on
the
point
of
refusing
them
until
Lord
Bryce
Caron
said,
“Your
Grace,
if
the
sorceress
is
with
us,
afterward
men
will
say
it
was
her
victory,
not
yours.
They
will
say
you
owe
your
crown
to
her
spells.”
That
had
turned
the
tide.
Davos
himself
had
held
his
tongue
during
the
arguments,
but
if
truth
be
told,
he
had
not
been
sad
to
see
the
back
of
her.
He
wanted
no
part
of
Melisandre
or
her
god.

To
starboard,
Devotion
drove
toward
shore,
sliding
out
a
plank.
Archers
scrambled
into
the
shallows,
holding
their
bows
high
over
their
heads
to
keep
the
strings
dry.
They
splashed
ashore
on
the
narrow
strand
beneath
the
bluffs.
Rocks
came
bouncing
down
from
the
castle
to
crash
among
them,
and
arrows
and
spears
as
well,
but
the
angle
was
steep
and
the
missiles
seemed
to
do
little
damage.

Prayer
landed
two
dozen
yards
upstream
and
Piety
was
slanting
toward
the
bank
when
the
defenders
came
pounding
down
the
riverside,
the
hooves
of
their
warhorses
sending
up
gouts
of
water
from
the
shallows.
The
knights
fell
among
the
archers
like
wolves
among
chickens,
driving
them
back
toward
the
ships
and
into
the
river
before
most
could
notch
an
arrow.
Men-at-arms
rushed
to
defend
them
with
spear
and
axe,
and
in
three
heartbeats
the
scene
had
turned
to
blood-soaked
chaos.
Davos
recognized
the
dog’s-head
helm
of
the
Hound.
A
white
cloak
streamed
from
his
shoulders
as
he
rode
his
horse
up
the
plank
onto
the
deck
of
Prayer,
hacking
down
anyone
who
blundered
within
reach.

Beyond
the
castle,
King’s
Landing
rose
on
its
hills
behind
the
encircling
walls.
The
riverfront
was
a
blackened
desolation;
the
Lannisters
had
burned
everything
and
pulled
back
within
the
Mud
Gate.
The
charred
spars
of
sunken
hulks
sat
in
the
shallows,
forbidding
access
to
the
long
stone
quays.
We
shall
have
no
landing
there.
He
could
see
the
tops
of
three
huge
trebuchets
behind
the
Mud
Gate.
High
on
Visenya’s
Hill,
sunlight
blazed
off
the
seven
crystal
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.

Davos
never
saw
the
battle
joined,
but
he
heard
it;
a
great
rending
crash
as
two
galleys
came
together.
He
could
not
say
which
two.
Another
impact
echoed
over
the
water
an
instant
later,
and
then
a
third.
Beneath
the
screech
of
splintering
wood,
he
heard
the
deep
thrum-thump
of
the
Fury’s
fore
catapult.
Stag
of
the
Sea
split
one
of
Joffrey’s
galleys
clean
in
two,
but
Dog’s
Nose
was
afire
and
Queen
Alysanne
was
locked
between
Lady
of
Silk
and
Lady’s
Shame,
her
crew
fighting
the
boarders
rail-to-rail.

Directly
ahead,
Davos
saw
the
enemy’s
Kingslander
drive
between
Faithful
and
Sceptre.
The
former
slid
her
starboard
oars
out
of
the
way
before
impact,
but
Sceptre’s
portside
oars
snapped
like
so
much
kindling
as
Kingslander
raked
along
her
side.
“Loose,”
Davos
commanded,
and
his
bowmen
sent
a
withering
rain
of
shafts
across
the
water.
He
saw
Kingslander’s
captain
fall,
and
tried
to
recall
the
man’s
name.

Ashore,
the
arms
of
the
great
trebuchets
rose
one,
two,
three,
and
a
hundred
stones
climbed
high
into
the
yellow
sky.
Each
one
was
as
large
as
a
man’s
head;
when
they
fell
they
sent
up
great
gouts
of
water,
smashed
through
oak
planking,
and
turned
living
men
into
bone
and
pulp
and
gristle.
All
across
the
river
the
first
line
was
engaged.
Grappling
hooks
were
flung
out,
iron
rams
crashed
through
wooden
hulls,
boarders
swarmed,
flights
of
arrows
whispered
through
each
other
in
the
drifting
smoke,
and
men
died…
but
so
far,
none
of
his.

Black
Betha
swept
upriver,
the
sound
of
her
oarmaster’s
drum
thundering
in
her
captain’s
head
as
he
looked
for
a
likely
victim
for
her
ram.
The
beleaguered
Queen
Alysanne
was
trapped
between
two
Lannister
warships,
the
three
made
fast
by
hooks
and
lines.

“Ramming
speed!”
Davos
shouted.

The
drumbeats
blurred
into
a
long
fevered
hammering,
and
Black
Betha
flew,
the
water
turning
white
as
milk
as
it
parted
for
her
prow.
Allard
had
seen
the
same
chance;
Lady
Marya
ran
beside
them.
The
first
line
had
been
transformed
into
a
confusion
of
separate
struggles.
The
three
tangled
ships
loomed
ahead,
turning,
their
decks
a
red
chaos
as
men
hacked
at
each
other
with
sword
and
axe.
A
little
more,
Davos
Seaworth
beseeched
the
Warrior,
bring
her
around
a
little
more,
show
me
her
broadside.

The
Warrior
must
have
been
listening.
Black
Betha
and
Lady
Marya
slammed
into
the
side
of
Lady’s
Shame
within
an
instant
of
each
other,
ramming
her
fore
and
aft
with
such
force
that
men
were
thrown
off
the
deck
of
Lady
of
Silk
three
boats
away.
Davos
almost
bit
his
tongue
off
when
his
teeth
jarred
together.
He
spat
out
blood.
Next
time
close
your
mouth,
you
fool.
Forty
years
at
sea,
and
yet
this
was
the
first
time
he’d
rammed
another
ship.
His
archers
were
loosing
arrows
at
will.

“Back
water,”
he
commanded.
When
Black
Betha
reversed
her
oars,
the
river
rushed
into
the
splintered
hole
she
left,
and
Lady’s
Shame
fell
to
pieces
before
his
eyes,
spilling
dozens
of
men
into
the
river.
Some
of
the
living
swam;
some
of
the
dead
floated;
the
ones
in
heavy
mail
and
plate
sank
to
the
bottom,
the
quick
and
the
dead
alike.
The
pleas
of
drowning
men
echoed
in
his
ears.

A
flash
of
green
caught
his
eye,
ahead
and
off
to
port,
and
a
nest
of
writhing
emerald
serpents
rose
burning
and
hissing
from
the
stern
of
Queen
Alysanne.
An
instant
later
Davos
heard
the
dread
cry
of
“Wildfire!”

He
grimaced.
Burning
pitch
was
one
thing,
wildfire
quite
another.
Evil
stuff,
and
well-nigh
unquenchable.
Smother
it
under
a
cloak
and
the
cloak
took
fire;
slap
at
a
fleck
of
it
with
your
palm
and
your
hand
was
aflame.
“Piss
on
wildfire
and
your
cock
burns
off,”
old
seamen
liked
to
say.
Still,
Ser
Imry
had
warned
them
to
expect
a
taste
of
the
alchemists’
vile
substance.
Fortunately,
there
were
few
true
pyromancers
left.
They
will
soon
run
out,
Ser
Imry
had
assured
them.

Davos
reeled
off
commands;
one
bank
of
oars
pushed
off
while
the
other
backed
water,
and
the
galley
came
about.
Lady
Marya
had
won
clear
too,
and
a
good
thing;
the
fire
was
spreading
over
Queen
Alysanne
and
her
foes
faster
than
he
would
have
believed
possible.
Men
wreathed
in
green
flame
leapt
into
the
water,
shrieking
like
nothing
human.
On
the
walls
of
King’s
Landing,
spitfires
were
belching
death,
and
the
great
trebuchets
behind
the
Mud
Gate
were
throwing
boulders.
One
the
size
of
an
ox
crashed
down
between
Black
Betha
and
Wraith,
rocking
both
ships
and
soaking
every
man
on
deck.
Another,
not
much
smaller,
found
Bold
Laughter.
The
Velaryon
galley
exploded
like
a
child’s
toy
dropped
from
a
tower,
spraying
splinters
as
long
as
a
man’s
arm.

Through
black
smoke
and
swirling
green
fire,
Davos
glimpsed
a
swarm
of
small
boats
bearing
downriver:
a
confusion
of
ferries
and
wherries,
barges,
skiffs,
rowboats,
and
hulks
that
looked
too
rotten
to
float.
It
stank
of
desperation;
such
driftwood
could
not
turn
the
tide
of
a
fight,
only
get
in
the
way.
The
lines
of
battle
were
hopelessly
ensnarled,
he
saw.
Off
to
port,
Lord
Steffon,
Ragged
Jenna,
and
Swift
Sword
had
broken
through
and
were
sweeping
upriver.
The
starboard
wing
was
heavily
engaged,
however,
and
the
center
had
shattered
under
the
stones
of
those
trebuchets,
some
captains
turning
downstream,
others
veering
to
port,
anything
to
escape
that
crushing
rain.
Fury
had
swung
her
aft
catapult
to
fire
back
at
the
city,
but
she
lacked
the
range;
the
barrels
of
pitch
were
shattering
under
the
walls.
Sceptre
had
lost
most
of
her
oars,
and
Faithful
had
been
rammed
and
was
starting
to
list.
He
took
Black
Betha
between
them,
and
struck
a
glancing
blow
at
Queen
Cersei’s
ornate
carved-and-gilded
pleasure
barge,
laden
with
soldiers
instead
of
sweetmeats
now.
The
collision
spilled
a
dozen
of
them
into
the
river,
where
Betha’s
archers
picked
them
off
as
they
tried
to
stay
afloat.

Matthos’s
shout
alerted
him
to
the
danger
from
port;
one
of
the
Lannister
galleys
was
coming
about
to
ram.
“Hard
to
starboard,”
Davos
shouted.
His
men
used
their
oars
to
push
free
of
the
barge,
while
others
turned
the
galley
so
her
prow
faced
the
onrushing
White
Hart.
For
a
moment
he
feared
he’d
been
too
slow,
that
he
was
about
to
be
sunk,
but
the
current
helped
swing
Black
Betha,
and
when
the
impact
came
it
was
only
a
glancing
blow,
the
two
hulls
scraping
against
each
other,
both
ships
snapping
oars.
A
jagged
piece
of
wood
flew
past
his
head,
sharp
as
any
spear.
Davos
flinched.
“Board
her!”
he
shouted.
Grappling
lines
were
flung.
He
drew
his
sword
and
led
them
over
the
rail
himself.

The
crew
of
the
White
Hart
met
them
at
the
rail,
but
Black
Betha’s
men-at-arms
swept
over
them
in
a
screaming
steel
tide.
Davos
fought
through
the
press,
looking
for
the
other
captain,
but
the
man
was
dead
before
he
reached
him.
As
he
stood
over
the
body,
someone
caught
him
from
behind
with
an
axe,
but
his
helm
turned
the
blow,
and
his
skull
was
left
ringing
when
it
might
have
been
split.
Dazed,
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
roll.
His
attacker
charged
screaming.
Davos
grasped
his
sword
in
both
hands
and
drove
it
up
point
first
into
the
man’s
belly.

One
of
his
crewmen
pulled
him
back
to
his
feet.
“Captain
ser,
the
Hart
is
ours.”
It
was
true,
Davos
saw.
Most
of
the
enemy
were
dead,
dying,
or
yielded.
He
took
off
his
helm,
wiped
blood
from
his
face,
and
made
his
way
back
to
his
own
ship,
trodding
carefully
on
boards
slimy
with
men’s
guts.
Matthos
lent
him
a
hand
to
help
him
back
over
the
rail.

For
those
few
instants,
Black
Betha
and
White
Hart
were
the
calm
eye
in
the
midst
of
the
storm.
Queen
Alysanne
and
Lady
of
Silk,
still
locked
together,
were
a
ranging
green
inferno,
drifting
downriver
and
dragging
pieces
of
Lady’s
Shame.
One
of
the
Myrish
galleys
had
slammed
into
them
and
was
now
afire
as
well.
Cat
was
taking
on
men
from
the
fast-sinking
Courageous.
The
captain
of
Dragonsbane
had
driven
her
between
two
quays,
ripping
out
her
bottom;
her
crew
poured
ashore
with
the
archers
and
men-at-arms
to
join
the
assault
on
the
walls.
Red
Raven,
rammed,
was
slowly
listing.
Stag
of
the
Sea
was
fighting
fires
and
boarders
both,
but
the
fiery
heart
had
been
raised
over
Joffrey’s
Loyal
Man.
Fury,
her
proud
bow
smashed
in
by
a
boulder,
was
engaged
with
Godsgrace.
He
saw
Lord
Velaryon’s
Pride
of
Driftmark
crash
between
two
Lannister
river
runners,
overturning
one
and
lighting
the
other
up
with
fire
arrows.
On
the
south
bank,
knights
were
leading
their
mounts
aboard
the
cogs,
and
some
of
the
smaller
galleys
were
already
making
their
way
across,
laden
with
men-at-arms.
They
had
to
thread
cautiously
between
sinking
ships
and
patches
of
drifting
wildfire.
The
whole
of
King
Stannis’s
fleet
was
in
the
river
now,
save
for
Salladhor
Saan’s
Lyseni.
Soon
enough
they
would
control
the
Blackwater.
Ser
Imry
will
have
his
victory,
Davos
thought,
and
Stannis
will
bring
his
host
across,
but
gods
be
good,
the
cost
of
this…

“Captain
ser!”
Matthos
touched
his
shoulder.

It
was
Swordfish,
her
two
banks
of
oars
lifting
and
falling.
She
had
never
brought
down
her
sails,
and
some
burning
pitch
had
caught
in
her
rigging.
The
flames
spread
as
Davos
watched,
creeping
out
over
ropes
and
sails
until
she
trailed
a
head
of
yellow
flame.
Her
ungainly
iron
ram,
fashioned
after
the
likeness
of
the
fish
from
which
she
took
her
name,
parted
the
surface
of
the
river
before
her.
Directly
ahead,
drifting
toward
her
and
swinging
around
to
present
a
tempting
plump
target,
was
one
of
the
Lannister
hulks,
floating
low
in
the
water.
Slow
green
blood
was
leaking
out
between
her
boards.

When
he
saw
that,
Davos
Seaworth’s
heart
stopped
beating.

“No,”
he
said.
“No,
NOOOOOOOO!”
Above
the
roar
and
crash
of
battle,
no
one
heard
him
but
Matthos.
Certainly
the
captain
of
the
Swordfish
did
not,
intent
as
he
was
on
finally
spearing
something
with
his
ungainly
fat
sword.
The
Swordfish
went
to
battle
speed.
Davos
lifted
his
maimed
hand
to
clutch
at
the
leather
pouch
that
held
his
fingerbones.

With
a
grinding,
splintering,
tearing
crash,
Swordfish
split
the
rotted
hulk
asunder.
She
burst
like
an
overripe
fruit,
but
no
fruit
had
ever
screamed
that
shattering
wooden
scream.
From
inside
her
Davos
saw
green
gushing
from
a
thousand
broken
jars,
poison
from
the
entrails
of
a
dying
beast,
glistening,
shining,
spreading
across
the
surface
of
the
river…

“Back
water,”
he
roared.
“Away.
Get
us
off
her,
back
water,
back
water!”
The
grappling
lines
were
cut,
and
Davos
felt
the
deck
move
under
his
feet
as
Black
Betha
pushed
free
of
White
Hart.
Her
oars
slid
down
into
the
water.

Then
he
heard
a
short
sharp
woof,
as
if
someone
had
blown
in
his
ear.
Half
a
heartbeat
later
came
the
roar.
The
deck
vanished
beneath
him,
and
black
water
smashed
him
across
the
face,
filling
his
nose
and
mouth.
He
was
choking,
drowning.
Unsure
which
way
was
up,
Davos
wrestled
the
river
in
blind
panic
until
suddenly
he
broke
the
surface.
He
spat
out
water,
sucked
in
air,
grabbed
hold
of
the
nearest
chunk
of
debris,
and
held
on.

Swordfish
and
the
hulk
were
gone,
blackened
bodies
were
floating
downstream
beside
him,
and
choking
men
clinging
to
bits
of
smoking
wood.
Fifty
feet
high,
a
swirling
demon
of
green
flame
danced
upon
the
river.
It
had
a
dozen
hands,
in
each
a
whip,
and
whatever
they
touched
burst
into
fire.
He
saw
Black
Betha
burning,
and
White
Hart
and
Loyal
Man
to
either
side.
Piety,
Cat,
Courageous,
Sceptre,
Red
Raven,
Harridan,
Faithful,
Fury,
they
had
all
gone
up,
Kingslander
and
Godsgrace
as
well,
the
demon
was
eating
his
own.
Lord
Velaryon’s
shining
Pride
of
Driftmark
was
trying
to
turn,
but
the
demon
ran
a
lazy
green
finger
across
her
silvery
oars
and
they
flared
up
like
so
many
tapers.
For
an
instant
she
seemed
to
be
stroking
the
river
with
two
banks
of
long
bright
torches.

The
current
had
him
in
its
teeth
by
then,
spinning
him
around
and
around.
He
kicked
to
avoid
a
floating
patch
of
wildfire.
My
sons,
Davos
thought,
but
there
was
no
way
to
look
for
them
amidst
the
roaring
chaos.
Another
hulk
heavy
with
wildfire
went
up
behind
him.
The
Blackwater
itself
seemed
to
boil
in
its
bed,
and
burning
spars
and
burning
men
and
pieces
of
broken
ships
filled
the
air.

I’m
being
swept
out
into
the
bay.
It
wouldn’t
be
as
bad
there;
he
ought
to
be
able
to
make
shore,
he
was
a
strong
swimmer.
Salladhor
Saan’s
galleys
would
be
out
in
the
bay
as
well,
Ser
Imry
had
commanded
them
to
stand
off…

And
then
the
current
turned
him
about
again,
and
Davos
saw
what
awaited
him
downstream.

The
chain.
Gods
save
us,
they’ve
raised
the
chain.

Where
the
river
broadened
out
into
Blackwater
Bay,
the
boom
stretched
taut,
a
bare
two
or
three
feet
above
the
water.
Already
a
dozen
galleys
had
crashed
into
it,
and
the
current
was
pushing
others
against
them.
Almost
all
were
aflame,
and
the
rest
soon
would
be.
Davos
could
make
out
the
striped
hulls
of
Salladhor
Saan’s
ships
beyond,
but
he
knew
he
would
never
reach
them.
A
wall
of
red-hot
steel,
blazing
wood,
and
swirling
green
flame
stretched
before
him.
The
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
had
turned
into
the
mouth
of
hell.





TYRION

Motionless
as
a
gargoyle,
Tyrion
Lannister
hunched
on
one
knee
atop
a
merlon.
Beyond
the
Mud
Gate
and
the
desolation
that
had
once
been
the
fishmarket
and
wharves,
the
river
itself
seemed
to
have
taken
fire.
Half
of
Stannis’s
fleet
was
ablaze,
along
with
most
of
Joffrey’s.
The
kiss
of
wildfire
turned
proud
ships
into
funeral
pyres
and
men
into
living
torches.
The
air
was
full
of
smoke
and
arrows
and
screams.

Downstream,
commoners
and
highborn
captains
alike
could
see
the
hot
green
death
swirling
toward
their
rafts
and
carracks
and
ferries,
borne
on
the
current
of
the
Blackwater.
The
long
white
oars
of
the
Myrish
galleys
flashed
like
the
legs
of
maddened
centipedes
as
they
fought
to
come
about,
but
it
was
no
good.
The
centipedes
had
no
place
to
run.

A
dozen
great
fires
raged
under
the
city
walls,
where
casks
of
burning
pitch
had
exploded,
but
the
wildfire
reduced
them
to
no
more
than
candles
in
a
burning
house,
their
orange
and
scarlet
pennons
fluttering
insignificantly
against
the
jade
holocaust.
The
low
clouds
caught
the
color
of
the
burning
river
and
roofed
the
sky
in
shades
of
shifting
green,
eerily
beautiful.
A
terrible
beauty.
Like
dragonfire.
Tyrion
wondered
if
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
felt
like
this
as
he
flew
above
his
Field
of
Fire.

The
furnace
wind
lifted
his
crimson
cloak
and
beat
at
his
bare
face,
yet
he
could
not
turn
away.
He
was
dimly
aware
of
the
gold
cloaks
cheering
from
the
hoardings.
He
had
no
voice
to
join
them.
It
was
a
half
victory.
It
will
not
be
enough.

He
saw
another
of
the
hulks
he’d
stuffed
full
of
King
Aerys’s
fickle
fruits
engulfed
by
the
hungry
flames.
A
fountain
of
burning
jade
rose
from
the
river
the
blast
so
bright
he
had
to
shield
his
eyes.
Plumes
of
fire
thirty
and
forty
feet
high
danced
upon
the
waters,
crackling
and
hissing.
For
a
few
moments
they
washed
out
the
screams.
There
were
hundreds
in
the
water,
drowning
or
burning
or
doing
a
little
of
both.

Do
you
hear
them
shrieking,
Stannis?
Do
you
see
them
burning?
This
is
your
work
as
much
as
mine.
Somewhere
in
that
seething
mass
of
men
south
of
the
Blackwater,
Stannis
was
watching
too,
Tyrion
knew.
He’d
never
had
his
brother
Robert’s
thirst
for
battle.
He
would
command
from
the
rear,
from
the
reserve,
much
as
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
wont
to
do.
Like
as
not,
he
was
sitting
a
warhorse
right
now,
clad
in
bright
armor,
his
crown
upon
his
head.
A
crown
of
red
gold,
Varys
says,
its
points
fashioned
in
the
shapes
of
flames.

“My
ships.”
Joffrey’s
voice
cracked
as
he
shouted
up
from
the
wallwalk,
where
he
huddled
with
his
guards
behind
the
ramparts.
The
golden
circlet
of
kingship
adorned
his
battle
helm.
“My
Kingslander’s
burning,
Queen
Cersei,
Loyal
Man.
Look,
that’s
Seaflower,
there.”
He
pointed
with
his
new
sword,
out
to
where
the
green
flames
were
licking
at
Seaflower’s
golden
hull
and
creeping
up
her
oars.
Her
captain
had
turned
her
upriver,
but
not
quickly
enough
to
evade
the
wildfire.

She
was
doomed,
Tyrion
knew.
There
was
no
other
way.
If
we
had
not
come
forth
to
meet
them,
Stannis
would
have
sensed
the
trap.
An
arrow
could
be
aimed,
and
a
spear,
even
the
stone
from
a
catapult,
but
wildfire
had
a
will
of
its
own.
Once
loosed,
it
was
beyond
the
control
of
mere
men.
“It
could
not
be
helped,”
he
told
his
nephew.
“Our
fleet
was
doomed
in
any
case.”

Even
from
atop
the
merlon—he
had
been
too
short
to
see
over
the
ramparts,
so
he’d
had
them
boost
him
up—the
flames
and
smoke
and
chaos
of
battle
made
it
impossible
for
Tyrion
to
see
what
was
happening
downriver
under
the
castle,
but
he
had
seen
it
a
thousand
times
in
his
mind’s
eye.
Bronn
would
have
whipped
the
oxen
into
motion
the
moment
Stannis’s
flagship
passed
under
the
Red
Keep;
the
chain
was
ponderous
heavy,
and
the
great
winches
turned
but
slowly,
creaking
and
rumbling.
The
whole
of
the
usurper’s
fleet
would
have
passed
by
the
time
the
first
glimmer
of
metal
could
be
seen
beneath
the
water.
The
links
would
emerge
dripping
wet,
some
glistening
with
mud,
link
by
link
by
link,
until
the
whole
great
chain
stretched
taut.
King
Stannis
had
rowed
his
fleet
up
the
Blackwater,
but
he
would
not
row
out
again.

Even
so,
some
were
getting
away.
A
river’s
current
was
a
tricky
thing,
and
the
wildfire
was
not
spreading
as
evenly
as
he
had
hoped.
The
main
channel
was
all
aflame,
but
a
good
many
of
the
Myrmen
had
made
for
the
south
bank
and
looked
to
escape
unscathed,
and
at
least
eight
ships
had
landed
under
the
city
walls.
Landed
or
wrecked,
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
they’ve
put
men
ashore.
Worse,
a
good
part
of
the
south
wing
of
the
enemy’s
first
two
battle
lines
had
been
well
upstream
of
the
inferno
when
the
hulks
went
up.
Stannis
would
be
left
with
thirty
or
forty
galleys,
at
a
guess;
more
than
enough
to
bring
his
whole
host
across,
once
they
had
regained
their
courage.

That
might
take
a
bit
of
time;
even
the
bravest
would
be
dismayed
after
watching
a
thousand
or
so
of
his
fellows
consumed
by
wildfire.
Hallyne
said
that
sometimes
the
substance
burned
so
hot
that
flesh
melted
like
tallow.
Yet
even
so…

Tyrion
had
no
illusions
where
his
own
men
were
concerned.
If
the
battle
looks
to
be
going
sour
they’ll
break,
and
they’ll
break
bad,
Jacelyn
Bywater
had
warned
him,
so
the
only
way
to
win
was
to
make
certain
the
battle
stayed
sweet,
start
to
finish.

He
could
see
dark
shapes
moving
through
the
charred
ruins
of
the
riverfront
wharfs.
Time
for
another
sortie,
he
thought.
Men
were
never
so
vulnerable
as
when
they
first
staggered
ashore.
He
must
not
give
the
foe
time
to
form
up
on
the
north
bank.

He
scrambled
down
off
the
merlon.
“Tell
Lord
Jacelyn
we’ve
got
enemy
on
the
riverfront,”
he
said
to
one
of
the
runners
Bywater
had
assigned
him.
To
another
he
said,
“Bring
my
compliments
to
Ser
Arneld
and
ask
him
to
swing
the
Whores
thirty
degrees
west.”
The
angle
would
allow
them
to
throw
farther,
if
not
as
far
out
into
the
water.

“Mother
promised
I
could
have
the
Whores,”
Joffrey
said.
Tyrion
was
annoyed
to
see
that
the
king
had
lifted
the
visor
of
his
helm
again.
Doubtless
the
boy
was
cooking
inside
all
that
heavy
steel…
but
the
last
thing
he
needed
was
some
stray
arrow
punching
through
his
nephew’s
eye.

He
clanged
the
visor
shut.
“Keep
that
closed,
Your
Grace;
your
sweet
person
is
precious
to
us
all.”
And
you
don’t
want
to
spoil
that
pretty
face,
either.
“The
Whores
are
yours.”
It
was
as
good
a
time
as
any;
flinging
more
firepots
down
onto
burning
ships
seemed
pointless.
Joff
had
the
Antler
Men
trussed
up
naked
in
the
square
below,
antlers
nailed
to
their
heads.
When
they’d
been
brought
before
the
Iron
Throne
for
justice,
he
had
promised
to
send
them
to
Stannis.
A
man
was
not
as
heavy
as
a
boulder
or
a
cask
of
burning
pitch,
and
could
be
thrown
a
deal
farther.
Some
of
the
gold
cloaks
had
been
wagering
on
whether
the
traitors
would
fly
all
the
way
across
the
Blackwater.
“Be
quick
about
it,
Your
Grace,”
he
told
Joffrey.
“We’ll
want
the
trebuchets
throwing
stones
again
soon
enough.
Even
wildfire
does
not
burn
forever.”

Joffrey
hurried
off
happy,
escorted
by
Ser
Meryn,
but
Tyrion
caught
Ser
Osmund
by
the
wrist
before
he
could
follow.
“Whatever
happens,
keep
him
safe
and
keep
him
there,
is
that
understood?”

“As
you
command.”
Ser
Osmund
smiled
amiably.

Tyrion
had
warned
Trant
and
Kettleblack
what
would
happen
to
them
should
any
harm
come
to
the
king.
And
Joffrey
had
a
dozen
veteran
gold
cloaks
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
steps.
I’m
protecting
your
wretched
bastard
as
well
as
I
can,
Cersei,
he
thought
bitterly.
See
you
do
the
same
for
Alayaya.

No
sooner
was
Joff
off
than
a
runner
came
panting
up
the
steps.
“My
lord,
hurry!”
He
threw
himself
to
one
knee.
“They’ve
landed
men
on
the
tourney
grounds,
hundreds!
They’re
bringing
a
ram
up
to
the
King’s
Gate.”

Tyrion
cursed
and
made
for
the
steps
with
a
rolling
waddle.
Podrick
Payne
waited
below
with
their
horses.
They
galloped
off
down
River
Row,
Pod
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
coming
hard
behind
him.
The
shuttered
houses
were
steeped
in
green
shadow,
but
there
was
no
traffic
to
get
in
their
way;
Tyrion
had
commanded
that
the
street
be
kept
clear,
so
the
defenders
could
move
quickly
from
one
gate
to
the
next.
Even
so,
by
the
time
they
reached
the
King’s
Gate,
he
could
hear
a
booming
crash
of
wood
on
wood
that
told
him
the
battering
ram
had
been
brought
into
play.
The
groaning
of
the
great
hinges
sounded
like
the
moans
of
a
dying
giant.
The
gatehouse
square
was
littered
with
the
wounded,
but
he
saw
lines
of
horses
as
well,
not
all
of
them
hurt,
and
sellswords
and
gold
cloaks
enough
to
form
a
strong
column.
“Form
up,”
he
shouted
as
he
leapt
to
the
ground.
The
gate
moved
under
the
impact
of
another
blow.
“Who
commands
here?
You’re
going
out.”

“No.”
A
shadow
detached
itself
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall,
to
become
a
tall
man
in
dark
grey
armor.
Sandor
Clegane
wrenched
off
his
helm
with
both
hands
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
steel
was
scorched
and
dented,
the
left
ear
of
the
snarling
hound
sheared
off.
A
gash
above
one
eye
had
sent
a
wash
of
blood
down
across
the
Hound’s
old
burn
scars,
masking
half
his
face.

“Yes.”
Tyrion
faced
him.

Clegane’s
breath
came
ragged.
“Bugger
that.
And
you.”

A
sellsword
stepped
up
beside
him.
“We
been
out.
Three
times.
Half
our
men
are
killed
or
hurt.
Wildfire
bursting
all
around
us,
horses
screaming
like
men
and
men
like
horses—”

“Did
you
think
we
hired
you
to
fight
in
a
tourney?
Shall
I
bring
you
a
nice
iced
milk
and
a
bowl
of
raspberries?
No?
Then
get
on
your
fucking
horse.
You
too,
dog.”

The
blood
on
Clegane’s
face
glistened
red,
but
his
eyes
showed
white.
He
drew
his
longsword.

He
is
afraid,
Tyrion
realized,
shocked.
The
Hound
is
frightened.
He
tried
to
explain
their
need.
“They’ve
taken
a
ram
to
the
gate,
you
can
hear
them,
we
need
to
disperse
them—”

“Open
the
gates.
When
they
rush
inside,
surround
them
and
kill
them.”
The
Hound
thrust
the
point
of
his
longsword
into
the
ground
and
leaned
upon
the
pommel,
swaying.
“I’ve
lost
half
my
men.
Horse
as
well.
I’m
not
taking
more
into
that
fire.”

Ser
Mandon
Moore
moved
to
Tyrion’s
side,
immaculate
in
his
enameled
white
plate.
“The
King’s
Hand
commands
you.”

“Bugger
the
King’s
Hand.”
Where
the
Hound’s
face
was
not
sticky
with
blood,
it
was
pale
as
milk.
“Someone
bring
me
a
drink.”
A
gold
cloak
officer
handed
him
a
cup.
Clegane
took
a
swallow,
spit
it
out,
flung
the
cup
away.
“Water?
Fuck
your
water.
Bring
me
wine.”

He
is
dead
on
his
feet.
Tyrion
could
see
it
now.
The
wound,
the
fire…
he’s
done,
I
need
to
find
someone
else,
but
who?
Ser
Mandon?
He
looked
at
the
men
and
knew
it
would
not
do.
Clegane’s
fear
had
shaken
them.
Without
a
leader,
they
would
refuse
as
well,
and
Ser
Mandon…
a
dangerous
man,
Jaime
said,
yes,
but
not
a
man
other
men
would
follow.

In
the
distance
Tyrion
heard
another
great
crash.
Above
the
walls,
the
darkening
sky
was
awash
with
sheets
of
green
and
orange
light.
How
long
could
the
gate
hold?

This
is
madness,
he
thought,
but
sooner
madness
than
defeat.
Defeat
is
death
and
shame.
“Very
well,
I’ll
lead
the
sortie.”

If
he
thought
that
would
shame
the
Hound
back
to
valor,
he
was
wrong.
Clegane
only
laughed.
“You?”

Tyrion
could
see
the
disbelief
on
their
faces.
“Me.
Ser
Mandon,
you’ll
bear
the
king’s
banner.
Pod,
my
helm.”
The
boy
ran
to
obey.
The
Hound
leaned
on
that
notched
and
blood-streaked
sword
and
looked
at
him
with
those
wide
white
eyes.
Ser
Mandon
helped
Tyrion
mount
up
again.
“Form
up!”
he
shouted.

His
big
red
stallion
wore
crinet
and
chamfron.
Crimson
silk
draped
his
hindquarters,
over
a
coat
of
mail.
The
high
saddle
was
gilded.
Podrik
Payne
handed
up
helm
and
shield,
heavy
oak
emblazoned
with
a
golden
hand
on
red,
surrounded
by
small
golden
lions.
He
walked
his
horse
in
a
circle,
looking
at
the
little
force
of
men.
Only
a
handful
had
responded
to
his
command,
no
more
than
twenty.
They
sat
their
horses
with
eyes
as
white
as
the
Hound’s.
He
looked
contemptuously
at
the
others,
the
knights
and
sellswords
who
had
ridden
with
Clegane.
“They
say
I’m
half
a
man,”
he
said.
“What
does
that
make
the
lot
of
you?”

That
shamed
them
well
enough.
A
knight
mounted,
helmetless,
and
rode
to
join
the
others.
A
pair
of
sellswords
followed.
Then
more.
The
King’s
Gate
shuddered
again.
In
a
few
moments
the
size
of
Tyrion’s
command
had
doubled.
He
had
them
trapped.
If
I
fight,
they
must
do
the
same,
or
they
are
less
than
dwarfs.

“You
won’t
hear
me
shout
out
Joffrey’s
name,”
he
told
them.
“You
won’t
hear
me
yell
for
Casterly
Rock
either.
This
is
your
city
Stannis
means
to
sack,
and
that’s
your
gate
he’s
bringing
down.
So
come
with
me
and
kill
the
son
of
a
bitch!”
Tyrion
unsheathed
his
axe,
wheeled
the
stallion
around,
and
trotted
toward
the
sally
port.
He
thought
they
were
following,
but
never
dared
to
look.





SANSA

The
torches
shimmered
brightly
against
the
hammered
metal
of
the
wall
sconces,
filling
the
Queen’s
Ballroom
with
silvery
light.
Yet
there
was
still
darkness
in
that
hall.
Sansa
could
see
it
in
the
pale
eyes
of
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
who
stood
by
the
back
door
still
as
stone,
taking
neither
food
nor
wine.
She
could
hear
it
in
Lord
Gyles’s
racking
cough,
and
the
whispered
voice
of
Osney
Kettleblack
when
he
slipped
in
to
bring
Cersei
the
tidings.

Sansa
was
finishing
her
broth
when
he
came
the
first
time,
entering
through
the
back.
She
glimpsed
him
talking
to
his
brother
Osfryd.
Then
he
climbed
the
dais
and
knelt
beside
the
high
seat,
smelling
of
horse,
four
long
thin
scratches
on
his
cheek
crusted
with
scabs,
his
hair
falling
down
past
his
collar
and
into
his
eyes.
For
all
his
whispering,
Sansa
could
not
help
but
hear.
“The
fleets
are
locked
in
battle.
Some
archers
got
ashore,
but
the
Hound’s
cut
them
to
pieces,
Y’Grace.
Your
brother’s
raising
his
chain,
I
heard
the
signal.
Some
drunkards
down
to
Flea
Bottom
are
smashing
doors
and
climbing
through
windows.
Lord
Bywater’s
sent
the
gold
cloaks
to
deal
with
them.
Baelor’s
Sept
is
jammed
full,
everyone
praying.”

“And
my
son?”

“The
king
went
to
Baelor’s
to
get
the
High
Septon’s
blessing.
Now
he’s
walking
the
walls
with
the
Hand,
telling
the
men
to
be
brave,
lifting
their
spirits
as
it
were.”

Cersei
beckoned
to
her
page
for
another
cup
of
wine,
a
golden
vintage
from
the
Arbor,
fruity
and
rich.
The
queen
was
drinking
heavily,
but
the
wine
only
seemed
to
make
her
more
beautiful;
her
cheeks
were
flushed,
and
her
eyes
had
a
bright,
feverish
heat
to
them
as
she
looked
down
over
the
hall.
Eyes
of
wildfire,
Sansa
thought.

Musicians
played.
Jugglers
juggled.
Moon
Boy
lurched
about
the
hall
on
stilts
making
mock
of
everyone,
while
Ser
Dontos
chased
serving
girls
on
his
broomstick
horse.
The
guests
laughed,
but
it
was
a
joyless
laughter,
the
sort
of
laughter
that
can
turn
into
sobbing
in
half
a
heartbeat.
Their
bodies
are
here,
but
their
thoughts
are
on
the
city
walls,
and
their
hearts
as
well.

After
the
broth
came
a
salad
of
apples,
nuts,
and
raisins.
At
any
other
time,
it
might
have
made
a
tasty
dish,
but
tonight
all
the
food
was
flavored
with
fear.
Sansa
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
hall
without
an
appetite.
Lord
Gyles
was
coughing
more
than
he
was
eating,
Lollys
Stokeworth
sat
hunched
and
shivering,
and
the
young
bride
of
one
of
Ser
Lancel’s
knights
began
to
weep
uncontrollably.
The
queen
commanded
Maester
Frenken
to
put
her
to
bed
with
a
cup
of
dreamwine.
“Tears,”
she
said
scornfully
to
Sansa
as
the
woman
was
led
from
the
hall.
“The
woman’s
weapon,
my
lady
mother
used
to
call
them.
The
man’s
weapon
is
a
sword.
And
that
tells
us
all
you
need
to
know,
doesn’t
it?”

“Men
must
be
very
brave,
though,”
said
Sansa.
“To
ride
out
and
face
swords
and
axes,
everyone
trying
to
kill
you…”

“Jaime
told
me
once
that
he
only
feels
truly
alive
in
battle
and
in
bed.”
She
lifted
her
cup
and
took
a
long
swallow.
Her
salad
was
untouched.
“I
would
sooner
face
any
number
of
swords
than
sit
helpless
like
this,
pretending
to
enjoy
the
company
of
this
flock
of
frightened
hens.”

“You
asked
them
here,
Your
Grace.”

“Certain
things
are
expected
of
a
queen.
They
will
be
expected
of
you
should
you
ever
wed
Joffrey.
Best
learn.”
The
queen
studied
the
wives,
daughters,
and
mothers
who
filled
the
benches.
“Of
themselves
the
hens
are
nothing,
but
their
cocks
are
important
for
one
reason
or
another,
and
some
may
survive
this
battle.
So
it
behooves
me
to
give
their
women
my
protection.
If
my
wretched
dwarf
of
a
brother
should
somehow
manage
to
prevail,
they
will
return
to
their
husbands
and
fathers
full
of
tales
about
how
brave
I
was,
how
my
courage
inspired
them
and
lifted
their
spirits,
how
I
never
doubted
our
victory
even
for
a
moment.”

“And
if
the
castle
should
fall?”

“You’d
like
that,
wouldn’t
you?”
Cersei
did
not
wait
for
a
denial.
“If
I’m
not
betrayed
by
my
own
guards,
I
may
be
able
to
hold
here
for
a
time.
Then
I
can
go
to
the
walls
and
offer
to
yield
to
Lord
Stannis
in
person.
That
will
spare
us
the
worst.
But
if
Maegor’s
Holdfast
should
fall
before
Stannis
can
come
up,
why
then,
most
of
my
guests
are
in
for
a
bit
of
rape,
I’d
say.
And
you
should
never
rule
out
mutilation,
torture,
and
murder
at
times
like
these.”

Sansa
was
horrified.
“These
are
women,
unarmed,
and
gently
born.”

“Their
birth
protects
them,”
Cersei
admitted,
“though
not
as
much
as
you’d
think.
Each
one’s
worth
a
good
ransom,
but
after
the
madness
of
battle,
soldiers
often
seem
to
want
flesh
more
than
coin.
Even
so,
a
golden
shield
is
better
than
none.
Out
in
the
streets,
the
women
won’t
be
treated
near
as
tenderly.
Nor
will
our
servants.
Pretty
things
like
that
serving
wench
of
Lady
Tanda’s
could
be
in
for
a
lively
night,
but
don’t
imagine
the
old
and
the
infirm
and
the
ugly
will
be
spared.
Enough
drink
will
make
blind
washerwomen
and
reeking
pig
girls
seem
as
comely
as
you,
sweetling.

“Me?”

“Try
not
to
sound
so
like
a
mouse,
Sansa.
You’re
a
woman
now,
remember?
And
betrothed
to
my
firstborn.”
The
queen
sipped
at
her
wine.
“Were
it
anyone
else
outside
the
gates,
I
might
hope
to
beguile
him.
But
this
is
Stannis
Baratheon.
I’d
have
a
better
chance
of
seducing
his
horse.”
She
noticed
the
look
on
Sansa’s
face,
and
laughed.
“Have
I
shocked
you,
my
lady?”
She
leaned
close.
“You
little
fool.
Tears
are
not
a
woman’s
only
weapon.
You’ve
got
another
one
between
your
legs,
and
you’d
best
learn
to
use
it.
You’ll
find
men
use
their
swords
freely
enough.
Both
kinds
of
swords.”

Sansa
was
spared
the
need
to
reply
when
two
Kettleblacks
reentered
the
hall.
Ser
Osmund
and
his
brothers
had
become
great
favorites
about
the
castle;
they
were
always
ready
with
a
smile
and
a
jest,
and
got
on
with
grooms
and
huntsmen
as
well
as
they
did
with
knights
and
squires.
With
the
serving
wenches
they
got
on
best
of
all,
it
was
gossiped.
Of
late
Ser
Osmund
had
taken
Sandor
Clegane’s
place
by
Joffrey’s
side,
and
Sansa
had
heard
the
women
at
the
washing
well
saying
he
was
as
strong
as
the
Hound,
only
younger
and
faster.
If
that
was
so,
she
wondered
why
she
had
never
once
heard
of
these
Kettleblacks
before
Ser
Osmund
was
named
to
the
Kingsguard.

Osney
was
all
smiles
as
he
knelt
beside
the
queen.
“The
hulks
have
gone
up,
Y’Grace.
The
whole
Blackwater’s
awash
with
wildfire.
A
hundred
ships
burning,
maybe
more.”

“And
my
son?”

“He’s
at
the
Mud
Gate
with
the
Hand
and
the
Kingsguard,
Y’Grace.
He
spoke
to
the
archers
on
the
hoardings
before,
and
gave
them
a
few
tips
on
handling
a
crossbow,
he
did.
All
agree,
he’s
a
right
brave
boy.”

“He’d
best
remain
a
right
live
boy.”
Cersei
turned
to
his
brother
Osfryd,
who
was
taller,
sterner,
and
wore
a
drooping
black
mustache.
“Yes?”

Osfryd
had
donned
a
steel
halfhelm
over
his
long
black
hair,
and
the
look
on
his
face
was
grim,
“Y’Grace,”
he
said
quietly,
“the
boys
caught
a
groom
and
two
maidservants
trying
to
sneak
out
a
postern
with
three
of
the
king’s
horses.”

“The
night’s
first
traitors,”
the
queen
said,
“but
not
the
last,
I
fear.
Have
Ser
Ilyn
see
to
them,
and
put
their
heads
on
pikes
outside
the
stables
as
a
warning.”
As
they
left,
she
turned
to
Sansa.
“Another
lesson
you
should
learn,
if
you
hope
to
sit
beside
my
son.
Be
gentle
on
a
night
like
this
and
you’ll
have
treasons
popping
up
all
about
you
like
mushrooms
after
a
hard
rain.
The
only
way
to
keep
your
people
loyal
is
to
make
certain
they
fear
you
more
than
they
do
the
enemy.”

“I
will
remember,
Your
Grace,”
said
Sansa,
though
she
had
always
heard
that
love
was
a
surer
route
to
the
people’s
loyalty
than
fear.
If
I
am
ever
a
queen,
I’ll
make
them
love
me.

Crabclaw
pies
followed
the
salad.
Then
came
mutton
roasted
with
leeks
and
carrots,
served
in
trenchers
of
hollowed
bread.
Lollys
ate
too
fast,
got
sick,
and
retched
all
over
herself
and
her
sister.
Lord
Gyles
coughed,
drank,
coughed,
drank,
and
passed
out.
The
queen
gazed
down
in
disgust
to
where
he
sprawled
with
his
face
in
his
trencher
and
his
hand
in
a
puddle
of
wine.
“The
gods
must
have
been
mad
to
waste
manhood
on
the
likes
of
him,
and
I
must
have
been
mad
to
demand
his
release.”

Osfryd
Kettleblack
returned,
crimson
cloak
swirling.
“There’s
folks
gathering
in
the
square,
Y’Grace,
asking
to
take
refuge
in
the
castle.
Not
a
mob,
rich
merchants
and
the
like.”

“Command
them
to
return
to
their
homes,”
the
queen
said.
“If
they
won’t
go,
have
our
crossbowmen
kill
a
few.
No
sorties;
I
won’t
have
the
gates
opened
for
any
reason.”

“As
you
command.”
He
bowed
and
moved
off.

The
queen’s
face
was
hard
and
angry.
“Would
that
I
could
take
a
sword
to
their
necks
myself.”
Her
voice
was
starting
to
slur.
“When
we
were
little,
Jaime
and
I
were
so
much
alike
that
even
our
lord
father
could
not
tell
us
apart.
Sometimes
as
a
lark
we
would
dress
in
each
other’s
clothes
and
spend
a
whole
day
each
as
the
other.
Yet
even
so,
when
Jaime
was
given
his
first
sword,
there
was
none
for
me.
‘What
do
I
get?’
I
remember
asking.
We
were
so
much
alike,
I
could
never
understand
why
they
treated
us
so
differently.
Jaime
learned
to
fight
with
sword
and
lance
and
mace,
while
I
was
taught
to
smile
and
sing
and
please.
He
was
heir
to
Casterly
Rock,
while
I
was
to
be
sold
to
some
stranger
like
a
horse,
to
be
ridden
whenever
my
new
owner
liked,
beaten
whenever
he
liked,
and
cast
aside
in
time
for
a
younger
filly.
Jaime’s
lot
was
to
be
glory
and
power,
while
mine
was
birth
and
moonblood.”

“But
you
were
queen
of
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Sansa
said.

“When
it
comes
to
swords,
a
queen
is
only
a
woman
after
all.”

Cersei’s
wine
cup
was
empty.
The
page
moved
to
fill
it
again,
but
she
turned
it
over
and
shook
her
head.
“No
more.
I
must
keep
a
clear
head.”

The
last
course
was
goat
cheese
served
with
baked
apples.
The
scent
of
cinnamon
filled
the
hall
as
Osney
Kettleblack
slipped
in
to
kneel
once
more
between
them.
“Y’Grace,”
he
murmured.
“Stannis
has
landed
men
on
the
tourney
grounds,
and
there’s
more
coming
across.
The
Mud
Gate’s
under
attack,
and
they’ve
brought
a
ram
to
the
King’s
Gate.
The
Imp’s
gone
out
to
drive
them
off.”

“That
will
fill
them
with
fear,”
the
queen
said
dryly.
“He
hasn’t
taken
Joff,
I
hope.”

“No,
Y’Grace,
the
king’s
with
my
brother
at
the
Whores,
flinging
Antler
Men
into
the
river.”

“With
the
Mud
Gate
under
assault?
Folly.
Tell
Ser
Osmund
I
want
him
out
of
there
at
once,
it’s
too
dangerous.
Fetch
him
back
to
the
castle.”

“The
Imp
said—”

“It’s
what
I
said
that
ought
concern
you.”
Cersei’s
eyes
narrowed.
“Your
brother
will
do
as
he’s
told,
or
I’ll
see
to
it
that
he
leads
the
next
sortie
himself,
and
you’ll
go
with
him.”

After
the
meal
had
been
cleared
away,
many
of
the
guests
asked
leave
to
go
to
the
sept.
Cersei
graciously
granted
their
request.
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughters
were
among
those
who
fled.
For
those
who
remained,
a
singer
was
brought
forth
to
fill
the
hall
with
the
sweet
music
of
the
high
harp.
He
sang
of
Jonquil
and
Florian,
of
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
and
his
love
for
his
brother’s
queen,
of
Nymeria’s
ten
thousand
ships.
They
were
beautiful
songs,
but
terribly
sad.
Several
of
the
women
began
to
weep,
and
Sansa
felt
her
own
eyes
growing
moist.

“Very
good,
dear.”
The
queen
leaned
close.
“You
want
to
practice
those
tears.
You’ll
need
them
for
King
Stannis.”

Sansa
shifted
nervously.
“Your
Grace?”

“Oh,
spare
me
your
hollow
courtesies.
Matters
must
have
reached
a
desperate
strait
out
there
if
they
need
a
dwarf
to
lead
them,
so
you
might
as
well
take
off
your
mask.
I
know
all
about
your
little
treasons
in
the
godswood.”

“The
godswood?”
Don’t
look
at
Ser
Dontos,
don’t,
don’t,
Sansa
told
herself.
She
doesn’t
know,
no
one
knows,
Dontos
promised
me,
my
Florian
would
never
fail
me.
“I’ve
done
no
treasons.
I
only
visit
the
godswood
to
pray.”

“For
Stannis.
Or
your
brother,
it’s
all
the
same.
Why
else
seek
your
father’s
gods?
You’re
praying
for
our
defeat.
What
would
you
call
that,
if
not
treason?”

“I
pray
for
Joffrey,”
she
insisted
nervously.

“Why,
because
he
treats
you
so
sweetly?”
The
queen
took
a
flagon
of
sweet
plum
wine
from
a
passing
serving
girl
and
filled
Sansa’s
cup.
“Drink,”
she
commanded
coldly.
“Perhaps
it
will
give
you
the
courage
to
deal
with
truth
for
a
change.”

Sansa
lifted
the
cup
to
her
lips
and
took
a
sip.
The
wine
was
cloyingly
sweet,
but
very
strong.

“You
can
do
better
than
that,”
Cersei
said.
“Drain
the
cup,
Sansa.
Your
queen
commands
you.”
It
almost
gagged
her,
but
Sansa
emptied
the
cup,
gulping
down
the
thick
sweet
wine
until
her
head
was
swimming.

“More?”
Cersei
asked.

“No.
Please.”

The
queen
looked
displeased.
“When
you
asked
about
Ser
Ilyn
earlier,
I
lied
to
you.
Would
you
like
to
hear
the
truth,
Sansa?
Would
you
like
to
know
why
he’s
really
here?”

She
did
not
dare
answer,
but
it
did
not
matter.
The
queen
raised
a
hand
and
beckoned,
never
waiting
for
a
reply.
Sansa
had
not
even
seen
Ser
Ilyn
return
to
the
hall,
but
suddenly
there
he
was,
striding
from
the
shadows
behind
the
dais
as
silent
as
a
cat.
He
carried
Ice
unsheathed.
Her
father
had
always
cleaned
the
blade
in
the
godswood
after
he
took
a
man’s
head,
Sansa
recalled,
but
Ser
Ilyn
was
not
so
fastidious.
There
was
blood
drying
on
the
rippling
steel,
the
red
already
fading
to
brown.
“Tell
Lady
Sansa
why
I
keep
you
by
us,”
said
Cersei.

Ser
Ilyn
opened
his
mouth
and
emitted
a
choking
rattle.
His
pox-scarred
face
had
no
expression.

“He’s
here
for
us,
he
says,”
the
queen
said.
“Stannis
may
take
the
city
and
he
may
take
the
throne,
but
I
will
not
suffer
him
to
judge
me.
I
do
not
mean
for
him
to
have
us
alive.”

“Us?”

“You
heard
me.
So
perhaps
you
had
best
pray
again,
Sansa,
and
for
a
different
outcome.
The
Starks
will
have
no
joy
from
the
fall
of
House
Lannister,
I
promise
you.”
She
reached
out
and
touched
Sansa’s
hair,
brushing
it
lightly
away
from
her
neck.





TYRION

The
slot
in
his
helm
limited
Tyrion’s
vision
to
what
was
before
him,
but
when
he
turned
his
head
he
saw
three
galleys
beached
on
the
tourney
grounds,
and
a
fourth,
larger
than
the
others,
standing
well
out
into
the
river,
firing
barrels
of
burning
pitch
from
a
catapult.

“Wedge,”
Tyrion
commanded
as
his
men
streamed
out
of
the
sally
port.
They
formed
up
in
spearhead,
with
him
at
the
point.
Ser
Mandon
Moore
took
the
place
to
his
right,
flames
shimmering
against
the
white
enamel
of
his
armor,
his
dead
eyes
shining
passionlessly
through
his
helm.
He
rode
a
coal-black
horse
barded
all
in
white,
with
the
pure
white
shield
of
the
Kingsguard
strapped
to
his
arm.
On
the
left,
Tyrion
was
surprised
to
see
Podrick
Payne,
a
sword
in
his
hand.
“You’re
too
young,”
he
said
at
once.
“Go
back.”

“I’m
your
squire,
my
lord.”

Tyrion
could
spare
no
time
for
argument.
“With
me,
then.
Stay
close.”
He
kicked
his
horse
into
motion.

They
rode
knee
to
knee,
following
the
line
of
the
looming
walls.
Joffrey’s
standard
streamed
crimson
and
gold
from
Ser
Mandon’s
staff,
stag
and
lion
dancing
hoof
to
paw.
They
went
from
a
walk
to
a
trot,
wheeling
wide
around
the
base
of
the
tower.
Arrows
darted
from
the
city
walls
while
stones
spun
and
tumbled
overhead,
crashing
down
blindly
onto
earth
and
water,
steel
and
flesh.
Ahead
loomed
the
King’s
Gate
and
a
surging
mob
of
soldiers
wrestling
with
a
huge
ram,
a
shaft
of
black
oak
with
an
iron
head.
Archers
off
the
ships
surrounded
them,
loosing
their
shafts
at
whatever
defenders
showed
themselves
on
the
gatehouse
walls.
“Lances,”
Tyrion
commanded.
He
sped
to
a
canter.

The
ground
was
sodden
and
slippery,
equal
parts
mud
and
blood.
His
stallion
stumbled
over
a
corpse,
his
hooves
sliding
and
churning
the
earth,
and
for
an
instant
Tyrion
feared
his
charge
would
end
with
him
tumbling
from
the
saddle
before
he
even
reached
the
foe,
but
somehow
he
and
his
horse
both
managed
to
keep
their
balance.
Beneath
the
gate
men
were
turning,
hurriedly
trying
to
brace
for
the
shock.
Tyrion
lifted
his
axe
and
shouted,
“King’s
Landing!”
Other
voices
took
up
the
cry,
and
now
the
arrowhead
flew,
a
long
scream
of
steel
and
silk,
pounding
hooves
and
sharp
blades
kissed
by
fire.

Ser
Mandon
dropped
the
point
of
his
lance
at
the
last
possible
instant,
and
drove
Joffrey’s
banner
through
the
chest
of
a
man
in
a
studded
jerkin,
lifting
him
full
off
his
feet
before
the
shaft
snapped.
Ahead
of
Tyrion
was
a
knight
whose
surcoat
showed
a
fox
peering
through
a
ring
of
flowers.
Florent
was
his
first
thought,
but
helmless
ran
a
close
second.
He
smashed
the
man
in
the
face
with
all
the
weight
of
axe
and
arm
and
charging
horse,
taking
off
half
his
head.
The
shock
of
impact
numbed
his
shoulder.
Shagga
would
laugh
at
me,
he
thought,
riding
on.

A
spear
thudded
against
his
shield.
Pod
galloped
beside
him,
slashing
down
at
every
foe
they
passed.
Dimly,
he
heard
cheers
from
the
men
on
the
walls.
The
battering
ram
crashed
down
into
the
mud,
forgotten
in
an
instant
as
its
handlers
fled
or
turned
to
fight.
Tyrion
rode
down
an
archer,
opened
a
spearman
from
shoulder
to
armpit,
glanced
a
blow
off
a
swordfish-crested
helm.
At
the
ram
his
big
red
reared
but
the
black
stallion
leapt
the
obstacle
smoothly
and
Ser
Mandon
flashed
past
him,
death
in
snow-white
silk.
His
sword
sheared
off
limbs,
cracked
heads,
broke
shields
asunder—though
few
enough
of
the
enemy
had
made
it
across
the
river
with
shields
intact.

Tyrion
urged
his
mount
over
the
ram.
Their
foes
were
fleeing.
He
moved
his
head
right
to
left
and
back
again,
but
saw
no
sign
of
Podrick
Payne.
An
arrow
clattered
against
his
cheek,
missing
his
eye
slit
by
an
inch.
His
jolt
of
fear
almost
unhorsed
him.
If
I’m
to
sit
here
like
a
stump,
I
had
as
well
paint
a
target
on
my
breastplate.

He
spurred
his
horse
back
into
motion,
trotting
over
and
around
a
scatter
of
corpses.
Downriver,
the
Blackwater
was
jammed
with
the
hulks
of
burning
galleys.
Patches
of
wildfire
still
floated
atop
the
water,
sending
fiery
green
plumes
swirling
twenty
feet
into
the
air.
They
had
dispersed
the
men
on
the
battering
ram,
but
he
could
see
fighting
all
along
the
riverfront.
Ser
Balon
Swann’s
men,
most
like,
or
Lancel’s,
trying
to
throw
the
enemy
back
into
the
water
as
they
swarmed
ashore
off
the
burning
ships.
“We’ll
ride
for
the
Mud
Gate,”
he
commanded.

Ser
Mandon
shouted,
“The
Mud
Gate!”
And
they
were
off
again.
“King’s
Landing!”
his
men
cried
raggedly,
and
“Halfman!
Halfman!”
He
wondered
who
had
taught
them
that.
Through
the
steel
and
padding
of
his
helm,
he
heard
anguished
screams,
the
hungry
crackle
of
flame,
the
shuddering
of
warhorns,
and
the
brazen
blast
of
trumpets.
Fire
was
everywhere.
Gods
be
good,
no
wonder
the
Hound
was
frightened.
It’s
the
flames
he
fears…

A
splintering
crash
rang
across
the
Blackwater
as
a
stone
the
size
of
a
horse
landed
square
amidships
on
one
of
the
galleys.
Ours
or
theirs?
Through
the
roiling
smoke,
he
could
not
tell.
His
wedge
was
gone;
every
man
was
his
own
battle
now.
I
should
have
turned
back,
he
thought,
riding
on.

The
axe
was
heavy
in
his
fist.
A
handful
still
followed
him,
the
rest
dead
or
fled.
He
had
to
wrestle
his
stallion
to
keep
his
head
to
the
east.
The
big
destrier
liked
fire
no
more
than
Sandor
Clegane
had,
but
the
horse
was
easier
to
cow.

Men
were
crawling
from
the
river,
men
burned
and
bleeding,
coughing
up
water,
staggering,
most
dying.
He
led
his
troop
among
them,
delivering
quicker
cleaner
deaths
to
those
strong
enough
to
stand.
The
war
shrank
to
the
size
of
his
eye
slit.
Knights
twice
his
size
fled
from
him,
or
stood
and
died.
They
seemed
little
things,
and
fearful.
“Lannister!”
he
shouted,
slaying.
His
arm
was
red
to
the
elbow,
glistening
in
the
light
off
the
river.
When
his
horse
reared
again,
he
shook
his
axe
at
the
stars
and
heard
them
call
out
“Halfman!
Halfman!”
Tyrion
felt
drunk.

The
battle
fever.
He
had
never
thought
to
experience
it
himself,
though
Jaime
had
told
him
of
it
often
enough.
How
time
seemed
to
blur
and
slow
and
even
stop,
how
the
past
and
the
future
vanished
until
there
was
nothing
but
the
instant,
how
fear
fled,
and
thought
fled,
and
even
your
body.
“You
don’t
feel
your
wounds
then,
or
the
ache
in
your
back
from
the
weight
of
the
armor,
or
the
sweat
running
down
into
your
eyes.
You
stop
feeling,
you
stop
thinking,
you
stop
being
you,
there
is
only
the
fight,
the
foe,
this
man
and
then
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next,
and
you
know
they
are
afraid
and
tired
but
you’re
not,
you’re
alive,
and
death
is
all
around
you
but
their
swords
move
so
slowly,
you
can
dance
through
them
laughing.”
Battle
fever.
I
am
half
a
man
and
drunk
with
slaughter,
let
them
kill
me
if
they
can!

They
tried.
Another
spearman
ran
at
him.
Tyrion
lopped
off
the
head
of
his
spear,
then
his
hand,
then
his
arm,
trotting
around
him
in
a
circle.
An
archer,
bowless,
thrust
at
him
with
an
arrow,
holding
it
as
if
it
were
a
knife.
The
destrier
kicked
at
the
man’s
thigh
to
send
him
sprawling,
and
Tyrion
barked
laughter.
He
rode
past
a
banner
planted
in
the
mud,
one
of
Stannis’s
fiery
hearts,
and
chopped
the
staff
in
two
with
a
swing
of
his
axe.
A
knight
rose
up
from
nowhere
to
hack
at
his
shield
with
a
two-handed
greatsword,
again
and
again,
until
someone
thrust
a
dagger
under
his
arm.
One
of
Tyrion’s
men,
perhaps.
He
never
saw.

“I
yield,
ser,”
a
different
knight
called
out,
farther
down
the
river.
“Yield.
Ser
knight,
I
yield
to
you.
My
pledge,
here,
here.”
The
man
lay
in
a
puddle
of
black
water,
offering
up
a
lobstered
gauntlet
in
token
of
submission.
Tyrion
had
to
lean
down
to
take
it
from
him.
As
he
did,
a
pot
of
wildfire
burst
overhead,
spraying
green
flame.
In
the
sudden
stab
of
light
he
saw
that
the
puddle
was
not
black
but
red.
The
gauntlet
still
had
the
knight’s
hand
in
it.
He
flung
it
back.
“Yield,”
the
man
sobbed
hopelessly,
helplessly.
Tyrion
reeled
away.

A
man-at-arms
grabbed
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
thrust
at
Tyrion’s
face
with
a
dagger.
He
knocked
the
blade
aside
and
buried
the
axe
in
the
nape
of
the
man’s
neck.
As
he
was
wresting
it
free,
a
blaze
of
white
appeared
at
the
edge
of
his
vision.
Tyrion
turned,
thinking
to
find
Ser
Mandon
Moore
beside
him
again,
but
this
was
a
different
white
knight.
Ser
Balon
Swann
wore
the
same
armor,
but
his
horse
trappings
bore
the
battling
black-and-white
swans
of
his
House.
He’s
more
a
spotted
knight
than
a
white
one,
Tyrion
thought
inanely.
Every
bit
of
Ser
Balon
was
spattered
with
gore
and
smudged
by
smoke.
He
raised
his
mace
to
point
downriver.
Bits
of
brain
and
bone
clung
to
its
head.
“My
lord,
look.”

Tyrion
swung
his
horse
about
to
peer
down
the
Blackwater.
The
current
still
flowed
black
and
strong
beneath,
but
the
surface
was
a
roil
of
blood
and
flame.
The
sky
was
red
and
orange
and
garish
green.
“What?”
he
said.
Then
he
saw.

Steel-clad
men-at-arms
were
clambering
off
a
broken
galley
that
had
smashed
into
a
pier.
So
many,
where
are
they
coming
from?
Squinting
into
the
smoke
and
glare,
Tyrion
followed
them
back
out
into
the
river.
Twenty
galleys
were
jammed
together
out
there,
maybe
more,
it
was
hard
to
count.
Their
oars
were
crossed,
their
hulls
locked
together
with
grappling
lines,
they
were
impaled
on
each
other’s
rams,
tangled
in
webs
of
fallen
rigging.
One
great
hulk
floated
hull
up
between
two
smaller
ships.
Wrecks,
but
packed
so
closely
that
it
was
possible
to
leap
from
one
deck
to
the
other
and
so
cross
the
Blackwater.

Hundreds
of
Stannis
Baratheon’s
boldest
were
doing
just
that.
Tyrion
saw
one
great
fool
of
a
knight
trying
to
ride
across,
urging
a
terrified
horse
over
gunwales
and
oars,
across
tilting
decks
slick
with
blood
and
crackling
with
green
fire.
We
made
them
a
bloody
bridge,
he
thought
in
dismay.
Parts
of
the
bridge
were
sinking
and
other
parts
were
afire
and
the
whole
thing
was
creaking
and
shifting
and
like
to
burst
asunder
at
any
moment,
but
that
did
not
seem
to
stop
them.
“Those
are
brave
men,”
he
told
Ser
Balon
in
admiration.
“Let’s
go
kill
them.”

He
led
them
through
the
guttering
fires
and
the
soot
and
ash
of
the
riverfront,
pounding
down
a
long
stone
quay
with
his
own
men
and
Ser
Balon’s
behind
him.
Ser
Mandon
fell
in
with
them,
his
shield
a
ragged
ruin.
Smoke
and
cinders
swirled
through
the
air,
and
the
foe
broke
before
their
charge,
throwing
themselves
back
into
the
water,
knocking
over
other
men
as
they
fought
to
climb
up.
The
foot
of
the
bridge
was
a
half-sunken
enemy
galley
with
Dragonsbane
painted
on
her
prow,
her
bottom
ripped
out
by
one
of
the
sunken
hulks
Tyrion
had
placed
between
the
quays.
A
spearman
wearing
the
red
crab
badge
of
House
Celtigar
drove
the
point
of
his
weapon
up
through
the
chest
of
Balon
Swann’s
horse
before
he
could
dismount,
spilling
the
knight
from
the
saddle.
Tyrion
hacked
at
the
man’s
head
as
he
flashed
by,
and
by
then
it
was
too
late
to
rein
up.
His
stallion
leapt
from
the
end
of
the
quay
and
over
a
splintered
gunwale,
landing
with
a
splash
and
a
scream
in
ankle-deep
water.
Tyrion’s
axe
went
spinning,
followed
by
Tyrion
himself,
and
the
deck
rose
up
to
give
him
a
wet
smack.

Madness
followed.
His
horse
had
broken
a
leg
and
was
screaming
horribly.
Somehow
he
managed
to
draw
his
dagger,
and
slit
the
poor
creature’s
throat.
The
blood
gushed
out
in
a
scarlet
fountain,
drenching
his
arms
and
chest.
He
found
his
feet
again
and
lurched
to
the
rail,
and
then
he
was
fighting,
staggering
and
splashing
across
crooked
decks
awash
with
water.
Men
came
at
him.
Some
he
killed,
some
he
wounded,
and
some
went
away,
but
always
there
were
more.
He
lost
his
knife
and
gained
a
broken
spear,
he
could
not
have
said
how.
He
clutched
it
and
stabbed,
shrieking
curses.
Men
ran
from
him
and
he
ran
after
them,
clambering
up
over
the
rail
to
the
next
ship
and
then
the
next.
His
two
white
shadows
were
always
with
him;
Balon
Swann
and
Mandon
Moore,
beautiful
in
their
pale
plate.
Surrounded
by
a
circle
of
Velaryon
spearmen,
they
fought
back
to
back;
they
made
battle
as
graceful
as
a
dance.

His
own
killing
was
a
clumsy
thing.
He
stabbed
one
man
in
the
kidney
when
his
back
was
turned,
and
grabbed
another
by
the
leg
and
upended
him
into
the
river.
Arrows
hissed
past
his
head
and
clattered
off
his
armor;
one
lodged
between
shoulder
and
breastplate,
but
he
never
felt
it.
A
naked
man
fell
from
the
sky
and
landed
on
the
deck,
body
bursting
like
a
melon
dropped
from
a
tower.
His
blood
spattered
through
the
slit
of
Tyrion’s
helm.
Stones
began
to
plummet
down,
crashing
through
the
decks
and
turning
men
to
pulp,
until
the
whole
bridge
gave
a
shudder
and
twisted
violently
underfoot,
knocking
him
sideways.

Suddenly
the
river
was
pouring
into
his
helm.
He
ripped
it
off
and
crawled
along
the
listing
deck
until
the
water
was
only
neck
deep.
A
groaning
filled
the
air,
like
the
death
cries
of
some
enormous
beast,
The
ship,
he
had
time
to
think,
the
ship’s
about
to
tear
loose.
The
broken
galleys
were
ripping
apart,
the
bridge
breaking
apart.
No
sooner
had
he
come
to
that
realization
than
he
heard
a
sudden
crack,
loud
as
thunder,
the
deck
lurched
beneath
him,
and
he
slid
back
down
into
the
water.

The
list
was
so
steep
he
had
to
climb
back
up,
hauling
himself
along
a
snapped
line
inch
by
bloody
inch.
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
he
saw
the
hulk
they’d
been
tangled
with
drifting
downstream
with
the
current,
spinning
slowly
as
men
leapt
over
her
side.
Some
wore
Stannis’s
flaming
heart,
some
Joffrey’s
stag-and-lion,
some
other
badges,
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
matter.
Fires
were
burning
upstream
and
down.
On
one
side
of
him
was
a
raging
battle,
a
great
confusion
of
bright
banners
waving
above
a
sea
of
struggling
men,
shield
walls
forming
and
breaking,
mounted
knights
cutting
through
the
press,
dust
and
mud
and
blood
and
smoke.
On
the
other
side,
the
Red
Keep
loomed
high
on
its
hill,
spitting
fire.
They
were
on
the
wrong
sides,
though.
For
a
moment
Tyrion
thought
he
was
going
mad,
that
Stannis
and
the
castle
had
traded
places.
How
could
Stannis
cross
to
the
north
bank?
Belatedly
he
realized
that
the
deck
was
turning,
and
somehow
he
had
gotten
spun
about,
so
castle
and
battle
had
changed
sides.
Battle,
what
battle,
if
Stannis
hasn’t
crossed
who
is
he
fighting?
Tyrion
was
too
tired
to
make
sense
of
it.
His
shoulder
ached
horribly,
and
when
he
reached
up
to
rub
it
he
saw
the
arrow,
and
remembered.
I
have
to
get
off
this
ship.
Downstream
was
nothing
but
a
wall
of
fire,
and
if
the
wreck
broke
loose
the
current
would
take
him
right
into
it.

Someone
was
calling
his
name
faintly
through
the
din
of
battle.
Tyrion
tried
to
shout
back.
“Here!
Here,
I’m
here,
help
me!”
His
voice
sounded
so
thin
he
could
scarcely
hear
himself.
He
pulled
himself
up
the
slanting
deck,
and
grabbed
for
the
rail.
The
hull
slammed
into
the
next
galley
over
and
rebounded
so
violently
he
was
almost
knocked
into
the
water.
Where
had
all
his
strength
gone?
It
was
all
he
could
do
to
hang
on.

“MY
LORD!
TAKE
MY
HAND!
MY
LORD
TYRION!”

There
on
the
deck
of
the
next
ship,
across
a
widening
gulf
of
black
water,
stood
Ser
Mandon
Moore,
a
hand
extended.
Yellow
and
green
fire
shone
against
the
white
of
his
armor,
and
his
lobstered
gauntlet
was
sticky
with
blood,
but
Tyrion
reached
for
it
all
the
same,
wishing
his
arms
were
longer.
It
was
only
at
the
very
last,
as
their
fingers
brushed
across
the
gap,
that
something
niggled
at
him…
Ser
Mandon
was
holding
out
his
left
hand,
why…

Was
that
why
he
reeled
backward,
or
did
he
see
the
sword
after
all?
He
would
never
know.
The
point
slashed
just
beneath
his
eyes,
and
he
felt
its
cold
hard
touch
and
then
a
blaze
of
pain.
His
head
spun
around
as
if
he’d
been
slapped.
The
shock
of
the
cold
water
was
a
second
slap
more
jolting
than
the
first.
He
flailed
for
something
to
grab
on
to,
knowing
that
once
he
went
down
he
was
not
like
to
come
back
up.
Somehow
his
hand
found
the
splintered
end
of
a
broken
oar.
Clutching
it
tight
as
a
desperate
lover,
he
shinnied
up
foot
by
foot.
His
eyes
were
full
of
water,
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood,
and
his
head
throbbed
horribly.
Gods
give
me
strength
to
reach
the
deck…
There
was
nothing
else,
only
the
oar,
the
water,
the
deck.

Finally
he
rolled
over
the
side
and
lay
breathless
and
exhausted,
flat
on
his
back.
Balls
of
green
and
orange
flame
crackled
overhead,
leaving
streaks
between
the
stars.
He
had
a
moment
to
think
how
pretty
it
was
before
Ser
Mandon
blocked
out
the
view.
The
knight
was
a
white
steel
shadow,
his
eyes
shining
darkly
behind
his
helm.
Tyrion
had
no
more
strength
than
a
rag
doll.
Ser
Mandon
put
the
point
of
his
sword
to
the
hollow
of
his
throat
and
curled
both
hands
around
the
hilt.

And
suddenly
he
lurched
to
the
left,
staggering
into
the
rail.
Wood
split,
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
vanished
with
a
shout
and
a
splash.
An
instant
later,
the
hulls
came
slamming
together
again,
so
hard
the
deck
seemed
to
jump.
Then
someone
was
kneeling
over
him.
“Jaime?”
he
croaked,
almost
choking
on
the
blood
that
filled
his
mouth.
Who
else
would
save
him,
if
not
his
brother?

“Be
still,
my
lord,
you’re
hurt
bad.”
A
boy’s
voice,
that
makes
no
sense,
thought
Tyrion.
It
sounded
almost
like
Pod.





SANSA

When
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
told
the
queen
that
the
battle
was
lost,
she
turned
her
empty
wine
cup
in
her
hands
and
said,
“Tell
my
brother,
ser.”
Her
voice
was
distant,
as
if
the
news
were
of
no
great
interest
to
her.

“Your
brother’s
likely
dead.”
Ser
Lancel’s
surcoat
was
soaked
with
the
blood
seeping
out
under
his
arm.
When
he
had
arrived
in
the
hall,
the
sight
of
him
had
made
some
of
the
guests
scream.
“He
was
on
the
bridge
of
boats
when
it
broke
apart,
we
think.
Ser
Mandon’s
likely
gone
as
well,
and
no
one
can
find
the
Hound.
Gods
be
damned,
Cersei,
why
did
you
have
them
fetch
Joffrey
back
to
the
castle?
The
gold
cloaks
are
throwing
down
their
spears
and
running,
hundreds
of
them.
When
they
saw
the
king
leaving,
they
lost
all
heart.
The
whole
Blackwater’s
awash
with
wrecks
and
fire
and
corpses,
but
we
could
have
held
if—”

Osney
Kettleblack
pushed
past
him.
“There’s
fighting
on
both
sides
of
the
river
now,
Y’Grace.
It
may
be
that
some
of
Stannis’s
lords
are
fighting
each
other,
no
one’s
sure,
it’s
all
confused
over
there.
The
Hound’s
gone,
no
one
knows
where,
and
Ser
Balon’s
fallen
back
inside
the
city.
The
riverside’s
theirs.
They’re
ramming
at
the
King’s
Gate
again,
and
Ser
Lancel’s
right,
your
men
are
deserting
the
walls
and
killing
their
own
officers.
There’s
mobs
at
the
Iron
Gate
and
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
fighting
to
get
out,
and
Flea
Bottom’s
one
great
drunken
riot.”

Gods
be
good,
Sansa
thought,
it
is
happening,
Joffrey’s
lost
his
head
and
so
have
I.
She
looked
for
Ser
Ilyn,
but
the
King’s
Justice
was
not
to
be
seen.
I
can
feel
him,
though.
He’s
close,
I’ll
not
escape
him,
he’ll
have
my
head.

Strangely
calm,
the
queen
turned
to
his
brother
Osfryd.
“Raise
the
drawbridge
and
bar
the
doors.
No
one
enters
or
leaves
Maegor’s
without
my
leave.”

“What
about
them
women
who
went
to
pray?”

“They
chose
to
leave
my
protection.
Let
them
pray;
perhaps
the
gods
will
defend
them.
Where’s
my
son?”

“The
castle
gatehouse.
He
wanted
to
command
the
crossbowmen.
There’s
a
mob
howling
outside,
half
of
them
gold
cloaks
who
came
with
him
when
we
left
the
Mud
Gate.”

“Bring
him
inside
Maegor’s
now.”

“No!”
Lancel
was
so
angry
he
forgot
to
keep
his
voice
down.
Heads
turned
toward
them
as
he
shouted,
“We’ll
have
the
Mud
Gate
all
over
again.
Let
him
stay
where
he
is,
he’s
the
king—”

“He’s
my
son.”
Cersei
Lannister
rose
to
her
feet.
“You
claim
to
be
a
Lannister
as
well,
cousin,
prove
it.
Osfryd,
why
are
you
standing
there?
Now
means
today.”

Osfryd
Kettleblack
hurried
from
the
hall,
his
brother
with
him.
Many
of
the
guests
were
rushing
out
as
well.
Some
of
the
women
were
weeping,
some
praying.
Others
simply
remained
at
the
tables
and
called
for
more
wine.
“Cersei,”
Ser
Lancel
pleaded,
“if
we
lose
the
castle,
Joffrey
will
be
killed
in
any
case,
you
know
that.
Let
him
stay,
I’ll
keep
him
by
me,
I
swear—”

“Get
out
of
my
way.”
Cersei
slammed
her
open
palm
into
his
wound.
Ser
Lancel
cried
out
in
pain
and
almost
fainted
as
the
queen
swept
from
the
room.
She
spared
Sansa
not
so
much
as
a
glance.
She’s
forgotten
me.
Ser
Ilyn
will
kill
me
and
she
won’t
even
think
about
it.

“Oh,
gods,”
an
old
woman
wailed.
“We’re
lost,
the
battle’s
lost,
she’s
running.”
Several
children
were
crying.
They
can
smell
the
fear.
Sansa
found
herself
alone
on
the
dais.
Should
she
stay
here,
or
run
after
the
queen
and
plead
for
her
life?

She
never
knew
why
she
got
to
her
feet,
but
she
did.
“Don’t
be
afraid,”
she
told
them
loudly.
“The
queen
has
raised
the
drawbridge.
This
is
the
safest
place
in
the
city.
There’s
thick
walls,
the
moat,
the
spikes…”

“What’s
happened?”
demanded
a
woman
she
knew
slightly,
the
wife
of
a
lesser
lordling.
“What
did
Osney
tell
her?
Is
the
king
hurt,
has
the
city
fallen?”

“Tell
us,”
someone
else
shouted.
One
woman
asked
about
her
father,
another
her
son.

Sansa
raised
her
hands
for
quiet.
“Joffrey’s
come
back
to
the
castle.
He’s
not
hurt.
They’re
still
fighting,
that’s
all
I
know,
they’re
fighting
bravely.
The
queen
will
be
back
soon.”
The
last
was
a
lie,
but
she
had
to
soothe
them.
She
noticed
the
fools
standing
under
the
galley.
“Moon
Boy,
make
us
laugh.”

Moon
Boy
did
a
cartwheel,
and
vaulted
on
top
of
a
table.
He
grabbed
up
four
wine
cups
and
began
to
juggle
them.
Every
so
often
one
of
them
would
come
down
and
smash
him
in
the
head.
A
few
nervous
laughs
echoed
through
the
hall.
Sansa
went
to
Ser
Lancel
and
knelt
beside
him.
His
wound
was
bleeding
afresh
where
the
queen
had
struck
him.
“Madness,”
he
gasped.
“Gods,
the
Imp
was
right,
was
right…”

“Help
him,”
Sansa
commanded
two
of
the
serving
men.
One
just
looked
at
her
and
ran,
flagon
and
all.
Other
servants
were
leaving
the
hall
as
well,
but
she
could
not
help
that.
Together,
Sansa
and
the
serving
man
got
the
wounded
knight
back
on
his
feet.
“Take
him
to
Maester
Frenken.”
Lancel
was
one
of
them,
yet
somehow
she
still
could
not
bring
herself
to
wish
him
dead.
I
am
soft
and
weak
and
stupid,
just
as
Joffrey
says.
I
should
be
killing
him,
not
helping
him.

The
torches
had
begun
to
burn
low,
and
one
or
two
had
flickered
out.
No
one
troubled
to
replace
them.
Cersei
did
not
return.
Ser
Dontos
climbed
the
dais
while
all
eyes
were
on
the
other
fool.
“Go
back
to
your
bedchamber,
sweet
Jonquil,”
he
whispered.
“Lock
yourself
in,
you’ll
be
safer
there.
I’ll
come
for
you
when
the
battle’s
done.”

Someone
will
come
for
me,
Sansa
thought,
but
will
it
be
you,
or
will
it
be
Ser
Ilyn?
For
a
mad
moment
she
thought
of
begging
Dontos
to
defend
her.
He
had
been
a
knight
too,
trained
with
the
sword
and
sworn
to
defend
the
weak.
No.
He
has
not
the
courage,
or
the
skill.
I
would
only
be
killing
him
as
well.

It
took
all
the
strength
she
had
in
her
to
walk
slowly
from
the
Queen’s
Ballroom
when
she
wanted
so
badly
to
run.
When
she
reached
the
steps,
she
did
run,
up
and
around
until
she
was
breathless
and
dizzy.
One
of
the
guards
knocked
into
her
on
the
stair.
A
jeweled
wine
cup
and
a
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
spilled
out
of
the
crimson
cloak
he’d
wrapped
them
in
and
went
clattering
down
the
steps.
He
hurried
after
them,
paying
Sansa
no
mind
once
he
decided
she
was
not
going
to
try
and
take
his
loot.

Her
bedchamber
was
black
as
pitch.
Sansa
barred
the
door
and
fumbled
through
the
dark
to
the
window.
When
she
ripped
back
the
drapes,
her
breath
caught
in
her
throat.

The
southern
sky
was
aswirl
with
glowing,
shifting
colors,
the
reflections
of
the
great
fires
that
burned
below.
Baleful
green
tides
moved
against
the
bellies
of
the
clouds,
and
pools
of
orange
light
spread
out
across
the
heavens.
The
reds
and
yellows
of
common
flame
warred
against
the
emeralds
and
jades
of
wildfire,
each
color
flaring
and
then
fading,
birthing
armies
of
short-lived
shadows
to
die
again
an
instant
later.
Green
dawns
gave
way
to
orange
dusks
in
half
a
heartbeat.
The
air
itself
smelled
burnt,
the
way
a
soup
kettle
sometimes
smelled
if
it
was
left
on
the
fire
too
long
and
all
the
soup
boiled
away.
Embers
drifted
through
the
night
air
like
swarms
of
fireflies.

Sansa
backed
away
from
the
window,
retreating
toward
the
safety
of
her
bed.
I’ll
go
to
sleep,
she
told
herself,
and
when
I
wake
it
will
be
a
new
day,
and
the
sky
will
be
blue
again.
The
fighting
will
be
done
and
someone
will
tell
me
whether
I’m
to
live
or
die.
“Lady,”
she
whimpered
softly,
wondering
if
she
would
meet
her
wolf
again
when
she
was
dead.

Then
something
stirred
behind
her,
and
a
hand
reached
out
of
the
dark
and
grabbed
her
wrist.

Sansa
opened
her
mouth
to
scream,
but
another
hand
clamped
down
over
her
face,
smothering
her.
His
fingers
were
rough
and
callused,
and
sticky
with
blood.
“Little
bird.
I
knew
you’d
come.”
The
voice
was
a
drunken
rasp.

Outside,
a
swirling
lance
of
jade
light
spit
at
the
stars,
filling
the
room
with
green
glare.
She
saw
him
for
a
moment,
all
black
and
green,
the
blood
on
his
face
dark
as
tar,
his
eyes
glowing
like
a
dog’s
in
the
sudden
glare.
Then
the
light
faded
and
he
was
only
a
hulking
darkness
in
a
stained
white
cloak.

“If
you
scream
I’ll
kill
you.
Believe
that.”
He
took
his
hand
from
her
mouth.
Her
breath
was
coming
ragged.
The
Hound
had
a
flagon
of
wine
on
her
bedside
table.
He
took
a
long
pull.
“Don’t
you
want
to
ask
who’s
winning
the
battle,
little
bird?”

“Who?”
she
said,
too
frightened
to
defy
him.

The
Hound
laughed.
“I
only
know
who’s
lost.
Me.”

He
is
drunker
than
I’ve
ever
seen
him.
He
was
sleeping
in
my
bed.
What
does
he
want
here?
“What
have
you
lost?”

“All.”
The
burnt
half
of
his
face
was
a
mask
of
dried
blood.
“Bloody
dwarf.
Should
have
killed
him.
Years
ago.”

“He’s
dead,
they
say.”

“Dead?
No.
Bugger
that.
I
don’t
want
him
dead.”
He
cast
the
empty
flagon
aside.
“I
want
him
burned.
If
the
gods
are
good,
they’ll
burn
him,
but
I
won’t
be
here
to
see.
I’m
going.”

“Going?”
She
tried
to
wriggle
free,
but
his
grasp
was
iron.

“The
little
bird
repeats
whatever
she
hears.
Going,
yes.”

“Where
will
you
go?”

“Away
from
here.
Away
from
the
fires.
Go
out
the
Iron
Gate,
I
suppose.
North
somewhere,
anywhere.”

“You
won’t
get
out,”
Sansa
said.
“The
queen’s
closed
up
Maegor’s,
and
the
city
gates
are
shut
as
well.”

“Not
to
me.
I
have
the
white
cloak.
And
I
have
this.”
He
patted
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
“The
man
who
tries
to
stop
me
is
a
dead
man.
Unless
he’s
on
fire.”
He
laughed
bitterly.

“Why
did
you
come
here?”

“You
promised
me
a
song,
little
bird.
Have
you
forgotten?”

She
didn’t
know
what
he
meant.
She
couldn’t
sing
for
him
now,
here,
with
the
sky
aswirl
with
fire
and
men
dying
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands.
“I
can’t,”
she
said.
“Let
me
go,
you’re
scaring
me.”

“Everything
scares
you.
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me.”

The
blood
masked
the
worst
of
his
scars,
but
his
eyes
were
white
and
wide
and
terrifying.
The
burnt
corner
of
his
mouth
twitched
and
twitched
again.
Sansa
could
smell
him;
a
stink
of
sweat
and
sour
wine
and
stale
vomit,
and
over
it
all
the
reek
of
blood,
blood,
blood.

“I
could
keep
you
safe,”
he
rasped.
“They’re
all
afraid
of
me.
No
one
would
hurt
you
again,
or
I’d
kill
them.”
He
yanked
her
closer,
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
meant
to
kiss
her.
He
was
too
strong
to
fight.
She
closed
her
eyes,
wanting
it
to
be
over,
but
nothing
happened.
“Still
can’t
bear
to
look,
can
you?”
she
heard
him
say.
He
gave
her
arm
a
hard
wrench,
pulling
her
around
and
shoving
her
down
onto
the
bed.
“I’ll
have
that
song.
Florian
and
Jonquil,
you
said.”
His
dagger
was
out,
poised
at
her
throat.
“Sing,
little
bird.
Sing
for
your
little
life.”

Her
throat
was
dry
and
tight
with
fear,
and
every
song
she
had
ever
known
had
fled
from
her
mind.
Please
don’t
kill
me,
she
wanted
to
scream,
please
don’t.
She
could
feel
him
twisting
the
point,
pushing
it
into
her
throat,
and
she
almost
closed
her
eyes
again,
but
then
she
remembered.
It
was
not
the
song
of
Florian
and
Jonquil,
but
it
was
a
song.
Her
voice
sounded
small
and
thin
and
tremulous
in
her
ears.

Gentle
Mother,
font
of
mercy,

save
our
sons
from
war,
we
pray,

stay
the
swords
and
stay
the
arrows,

let
them
know
a
better
day.

Gentle
Mother,
strength
of
women,

help
our
daughters
through
this
fray,

soothe
the
wrath
and
tame
the
fury,

teach
us
all
a
kinder
way.

She
had
forgotten
the
other
verses.
When
her
voice
trailed
off,
she
feared
he
might
kill
her,
but
after
a
moment
the
Hound
took
the
blade
from
her
throat,
never
speaking.

Some
instinct
made
her
lift
her
hand
and
cup
his
cheek
with
her
fingers.
The
room
was
too
dark
for
her
to
see
him,
but
she
could
feel
the
stickiness
of
the
blood,
and
a
wetness
that
was
not
blood.
“Little
bird,”
he
said
once
more,
his
voice
raw
and
harsh
as
steel
on
stone.
Then
he
rose
from
the
bed.
Sansa
heard
cloth
ripping,
followed
by
the
softer
sound
of
retreating
footsteps.

When
she
crawled
out
of
bed,
long
moments
later,
she
was
alone.
She
found
his
cloak
on
the
floor,
twisted
up
tight,
the
white
wool
stained
by
blood
and
fire.
The
sky
outside
was
darker
by
then,
with
only
a
few
pale
green
ghosts
dancing
against
the
stars.
A
chill
wind
was
blowing,
banging
the
shutters.
Sansa
was
cold.
She
shook
out
the
torn
cloak
and
huddled
beneath
it
on
the
floor,
shivering.

How
long
she
stayed
there
she
could
not
have
said,
but
after
a
time
she
heard
a
bell
ringing,
far
off
across
the
city.
The
sound
was
a
deep-throated
bronze
booming,
coming
faster
with
each
knell.
Sansa
was
wondering
what
it
might
mean
when
a
second
bell
joined
in,
and
a
third,
their
voices
calling
across
the
hills
and
hollows,
the
alleys
and
towers,
to
every
corner
of
King’s
Landing.
She
threw
off
the
cloak
and
went
to
her
window.

The
first
faint
hint
of
dawn
was
visible
in
the
east,
and
the
Red
Keep’s
own
bells
were
ringing
now,
joining
in
the
swelling
river
of
sound
that
flowed
from
the
seven
crystal
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
They
had
rung
the
bells
when
King
Robert
died,
she
remembered,
but
this
was
different,
no
slow
dolorous
death
knell
but
a
joyful
thunder.
She
could
hear
men
shouting
in
the
streets
as
well,
and
something
that
could
only
be
cheers.

It
was
Ser
Dontos
who
brought
her
the
word.
He
staggered
through
her
open
door,
wrapped
her
in
his
flabby
arms,
and
whirled
her
around
and
around
the
room,
whooping
so
incoherently
that
Sansa
understood
not
a
word
of
it.
He
was
as
drunk
as
the
Hound
had
been,
but
in
him
it
was
a
dancing
happy
drunk.
She
was
breathless
and
dizzy
when
he
let
her
down.
“What
is
it?”
She
clutched
at
a
bedpost.
“What’s
happened?
Tell
me!”

“It’s
done!
Done!
Done!
The
city
is
saved.
Lord
Stannis
is
dead
,
Lord
Stannis
is
fled,
no
one
knows,
no
one
cares,
his
host
is
broken,
the
danger’s
done.
Slaughtered,
scattered,
or
gone
over,
they
say.
Oh,
the
bright
banners!
The
banners,
Jonquil,
the
banners!
Do
you
have
any
wine?
We
ought
to
drink
to
this
day,
yes.
It
means
you’re
safe,
don’t
you
see?”

“Tell
me
what’s
happened!”
Sansa
shook
him.

Ser
Dontos
laughed
and
hopped
from
one
leg
to
the
other,
almost
falling.
“They
came
up
through
the
ashes
while
the
river
was
burning.
The
river,
Stannis
was
neck
deep
in
the
river,
and
they
took
him
from
the
rear.
Oh,
to
be
a
knight
again,
to
have
been
part
of
it!
His
own
men
hardly
fought,
they
say.
Some
ran
but
more
bent
the
knee
and
went
over,
shouting
for
Lord
Renly!
What
must
Stannis
have
thought
when
he
heard
that?
I
had
it
from
Osney
Kettleblack
who
had
it
from
Ser
Osmund,
but
Ser
Balon’s
back
now
and
his
men
say
the
same,
and
the
gold
cloaks
as
well.
We’re
delivered,
sweetling!
They
came
up
the
roseroad
and
along
the
riverbank,
through
all
the
fields
Stannis
had
burned,
the
ashes
puffing
up
around
their
boots
and
turning
all
their
armor
grey,
but
oh!
the
banners
must
have
been
bright,
the
golden
rose
and
golden
lion
and
all
the
others,
the
Marbrand
tree
and
the
Rowan,
Tarly’s
huntsman
and
Redwyne’s
grapes
and
Lady
Oakheart’s
leaf.
All
the
westermen,
all
the
power
of
Highgarden
and
Casterly
Rock!
Lord
Tywin
himself
had
their
right
wing
on
the
north
side
of
the
river,
with
Randyll
Tarly
commanding
the
center
and
Mace
Tyrell
the
left,
but
the
vanguard
won
the
fight.
They
plunged
through
Stannis
like
a
lance
through
a
pumpkin,
every
man
of
them
howling
like
some
demon
in
steel.
And
do
you
know
who
led
the
vanguard?
Do
you?
Do
you?
Do
you?”

“Robb?”
It
was
too
much
to
be
hoped,
but…

“It
was
Lord
Renly!
Lord
Renly
in
his
green
armor,
with
the
fires
shimmering
off
his
golden
antlers!
Lord
Renly
with
his
tall
spear
in
his
hand!
They
say
he
killed
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
himself
in
single
combat,
and
a
dozen
other
great
knights
as
well.
It
was
Renly,
it
was
Renly,
it
was
Renly!
Oh!
the
banners,
darling
Sansa!
Oh!
to
be
a
knight!”





DAENERYS

She
was
breaking
her
fast
on
a
bowl
of
cold
shrimp-and-persimmon
soup
when
Irri
brought
her
a
Qartheen
gown,
an
airy
confection
of
ivory
samite
patterned
with
seed
pearls.
“Take
it
away,”
Dany
said.
“The
docks
are
no
place
for
lady’s
finery.”

If
the
Milk
Men
thought
her
such
a
savage,
she
would
dress
the
part
for
them.
When
she
went
to
the
stables,
she
wore
faded
sandsilk
pants
and
woven
grass
sandals.
Her
small
breasts
moved
freely
beneath
a
painted
Dothraki
vest,
and
a
curved
dagger
hung
from
her
medallion
belt.
Jhiqui
had
braided
her
hair
Dothraki
fashion,
and
fastened
a
silver
bell
to
the
end
of
the
braid.
“I
have
won
no
victories,”
she
tried
telling
her
handmaid
when
the
bell
tinkled
softly.

Jhiqui
disagreed.
“You
burned
the
maegi
in
their
house
of
dust
and
sent
their
souls
to
hell.”

That
was
Drogon’s
victory,
not
mine,
Dany
wanted
to
say,
but
she
held
her
tongue.
The
Dothraki
would
esteem
her
all
the
more
for
a
few
bells
in
her
hair.
She
chimed
as
she
mounted
her
silver
mare,
and
again
with
every
stride,
but
neither
Ser
Jorah
nor
her
bloodriders
made
mention
of
it.
To
guard
her
people
and
her
dragons
in
her
absence,
she
chose
Rakharo.
Jhogo
and
Aggo
would
ride
with
her
to
the
waterfront.

They
left
the
marble
palaces
and
fragrant
gardens
behind
and
made
their
way
through
a
poorer
part
of
the
city
where
modest
brick
houses
turned
blind
walls
to
the
street.
There
were
fewer
horses
and
camels
to
be
seen,
and
a
dearth
of
palanquins,
but
the
streets
teemed
with
children,
beggars,
and
skinny
dogs
the
color
of
sand.
Pale
men
in
dusty
linen
skirts
stood
beneath
arched
doorways
to
watch
them
pass.
They
know
who
I
am,
and
they
do
not
love
me.
Dany
could
tell
from
the
way
they
looked
at
her.

Ser
Jorah
would
sooner
have
tucked
her
inside
her
palanquin,
safely
hidden
behind
silken
curtains,
but
she
refused
him.
She
had
reclined
too
long
on
satin
cushions,
letting
oxen
bear
her
hither
and
yon.
At
least
when
she
rode
she
felt
as
though
she
was
getting
somewhere.

It
was
not
by
choice
that
she
sought
the
waterfront.
She
was
fleeing
again.
Her
whole
life
had
been
one
long
flight,
it
seemed.
She
had
begun
running
in
her
mother’s
womb,
and
never
once
stopped.
How
often
had
she
and
Viserys
stolen
away
in
the
black
of
night,
a
bare
step
ahead
of
the
Usurper’s
hired
knives?
But
it
was
run
or
die.
Xaro
had
learned
that
Pyat
Pree
was
gathering
the
surviving
warlocks
together
to
work
ill
on
her.

Dany
had
laughed
when
he
told
her.
“Was
it
not
you
who
told
me
warlocks
were
no
more
than
old
soldiers,
vainly
boasting
of
forgotten
deeds
and
lost
prowess?”

Xaro
looked
troubled.
“And
so
it
was,
then.
But
now?
I
am
less
certain.
It
is
said
that
the
glass
candles
are
burning
in
the
house
of
Urrathon
Night-Walker,
that
have
not
burned
in
a
hundred
years.
Ghost
grass
grows
in
the
Garden
of
Gehane,
phantom
tortoises
have
been
seen
carrying
messages
between
the
windowless
houses
on
Warlock’s
Way,
and
all
the
rats
in
the
city
are
chewing
off
their
tails.
The
wife
of
Mathos
Mallarawan,
who
once
mocked
a
warlock’s
drab
moth-eaten
robe,
has
gone
mad
and
will
wear
no
clothes
at
all.
Even
fresh-washed
silks
make
her
feel
as
though
a
thousand
insects
were
crawling
on
her
skin.
And
Blind
Sybassion
the
Eater
of
Eyes
can
see
again,
or
so
his
slaves
do
swear.
A
man
must
wonder.”
He
sighed.
“These
are
strange
times
in
Qarth.
And
strange
times
are
bad
for
trade.
It
grieves
me
to
say
so,
yet
it
might
be
best
if
you
left
Qarth
entirely,
and
sooner
rather
than
later.”
Xaro
stroked
her
fingers
reassuringly.
“You
need
not
go
alone,
though.
You
have
seen
dark
visions
in
the
Palace
of
Dust,
but
Xaro
has
dreamed
brighter
dreams.
I
see
you
happily
abed,
with
our
child
at
your
breast.
Sail
with
me
around
the
Jade
Sea,
and
we
can
yet
make
it
so!
It
is
not
too
late.
Give
me
a
son,
my
sweet
song
of
joy!”

Give
you
a
dragon,
you
mean.
“I
will
not
wed
you,
Xaro.”

His
face
had
grown
cold
at
that.
“Then
go.”

“But
where?”

“Somewhere
far
from
here.”

Well,
perhaps
it
was
time.
The
people
of
her
khalasar
had
welcomed
the
chance
to
recover
from
the
ravages
of
the
red
waste,
but
now
that
they
were
plump
and
rested
once
again,
they
began
to
grow
unruly.
Dothraki
were
not
accustomed
to
staying
long
in
one
place.
They
were
a
warrior
people,
not
made
for
cities.
Perhaps
she
had
lingered
in
Qarth
too
long,
seduced
by
its
comforts
and
its
beauties.
It
was
a
city
that
always
promised
more
than
it
would
give
you,
it
seemed
to
her,
and
her
welcome
here
had
turned
sour
since
the
House
of
the
Undying
had
collapsed
in
a
great
gout
of
smoke
and
flame.
Overnight
the
Qartheen
had
come
to
remember
that
dragons
were
dangerous.
No
longer
did
they
vie
with
each
other
to
give
her
gifts.
Instead
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood
had
called
openly
for
her
expulsion,
and
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers
for
her
death.
It
was
all
Xaro
could
do
to
keep
the
Thirteen
from
joining
them.

But
where
am
I
to
go?
Ser
Jorah
proposed
that
they
journey
farther
east,
away
from
her
enemies
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Her
bloodriders
would
sooner
have
returned
to
their
great
grass
sea,
even
if
it
meant
braving
the
red
waste
again.
Dany
herself
had
toyed
with
the
idea
of
settling
in
Vaes
Tolorro
until
her
dragons
grew
great
and
strong.
But
her
heart
was
full
of
doubts.
Each
of
these
felt
wrong,
somehow…
and
even
when
she
decided
where
to
go,
the
question
of
how
she
would
get
there
remained
troublesome.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
be
no
help
to
her,
she
knew
that
now.
For
all
his
professions
of
devotion,
he
was
playing
his
own
game,
not
unlike
Pyat
Pree.
The
night
he
asked
her
to
leave,
Dany
had
begged
one
last
favor
of
him.
“An
army,
is
it?”
Xaro
asked.
“A
kettle
of
gold?
A
galley,
perhaps?”

Dany
blushed.
She
hated
begging.
“A
ship,
yes.”

Xaro’s
eyes
had
glittered
as
brightly
as
the
jewels
in
his
nose.
“I
am
a
trader,
Khaleesi.
So
perhaps
we
should
speak
no
more
of
giving,
but
rather
of
trade.
For
one
of
your
dragons,
you
shall
have
ten
of
the
finest
ships
in
my
fleet.
You
need
only
say
that
one
sweet
word.”

“No,”
she
said.

“Alas,”
Xaro
sobbed,
“that
was
not
the
word
I
meant.”

“Would
you
ask
a
mother
to
sell
one
of
her
children?”

“Whyever
not?
They
can
always
make
more.
Mothers
sell
their
children
every
day.”

“Not
the
Mother
of
Dragons.”

“Not
even
for
twenty
ships?”

“Not
for
a
hundred.”

His
mouth
curled
downward.
“I
do
not
have
a
hundred.
But
you
have
three
dragons.
Grant
me
one,
for
all
my
kindnesses.
You
will
still
have
two
and
thirty
ships
as
well.”

Thirty
ships
would
be
enough
to
land
a
small
army
on
the
shore
of
Westeros.
But
I
do
not
have
a
small
army.
“How
many
ships
do
you
own,
Xaro?”

“Eighty-three,
if
one
does
not
count
my
pleasure
barge.”

“And
your
colleagues
in
the
Thirteen?”

“Among
us
all,
perhaps
a
thousand.”

“And
the
Spicers
and
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood?”

“Their
trifling
fleets
are
of
no
account.”

“Even
so,”
she
said,
“tell
me.”

“Twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
for
the
Spicers.
No
more
than
eight
hundred
for
the
Brotherhood.”

“And
the
Asshai’i,
the
Braavosi,
the
Summer
Islanders,
the
Ibbenese,
and
all
the
other
peoples
who
sail
the
great
salt
sea,
how
many
ships
do
they
have?
All
together?”

“Many
and
more,”
he
said
irritably.
“What
does
this
matter?”

“I
am
trying
to
set
a
price
on
one
of
the
three
living
dragons
in
the
world.”
Dany
smiled
at
him
sweetly.
“it
seems
to
me
that
one-third
of
all
the
ships
in
the
world
would
be
fair.”

Xaro’s
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
on
either
side
of
his
jewel-encrusted
nose.
“Did
I
not
warn
you
not
to
enter
the
Palace
of
Dust?
This
is
the
very
thing
I
feared.
The
whispers
of
the
warlocks
have
made
you
as
mad
as
Mallarawan’s
wife.
A
third
of
all
the
ships
in
the
world?
Pah.
Pah,
I
say.
Pah.”

Dany
had
not
seen
him
since.
His
seneschal
brought
her
messages,
each
cooler
than
the
last.
She
must
quit
his
house.
He
was
done
feeding
her
and
her
people.
He
demanded
the
return
of
his
gifts,
which
she
had
accepted
in
bad
faith.
Her
only
consolation
was
that
at
least
she’d
had
the
great
good
sense
not
to
marry
him.

The
warlocks
whispered
of
three
treasons…
once
for
blood
and
once
for
gold
and
once
for
love.
The
first
traitor
was
surely
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
who
had
murdered
Khal
Drogo
and
their
unborn
son
to
avenge
her
people.
Could
Pyat
Pree
and
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
be
the
second
and
the
third?
She
did
not
think
so.
What
Pyat
did
was
not
for
gold,
and
Xaro
had
never
truly
loved
her.

The
streets
grew
emptier
as
they
passed
through
a
district
given
over
to
gloomy
stone
warehouses.
Aggo
went
before
her
and
Jhogo
behind,
leaving
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
at
her
side.
Her
bell
rang
softly,
and
Dany
found
her
thoughts
returning
to
the
Palace
of
Dust
once
more,
as
the
tongue
returns
to
a
space
left
by
a
missing
tooth.
Child
of
three,
they
had
called
her,
daughter
of
death,
slayer
of
lies,
bride
of
fire.
So
many
threes.
Three
fires,
three
mounts
to
ride,
three
treasons.
“The
dragon
has
three
heads,”
she
sighed.
“Do
you
know
what
that
means,
Jorah?”

“Your
Grace?
The
sigil
of
House
Targaryen
is
a
three-headed
dragon,
red
on
black.”

“I
know
that.
But
there
are
no
three-headed
dragons.”

“The
three
heads
were
Aegon
and
his
sisters.”

“Visenya
and
Rhaenys,”
she
recalled.
“I
am
descended
from
Aegon
and
Rhaenys
through
their
son
Aenys
and
their
grandson
Jaehaerys.”

“Blue
lips
speak
only
lies,
isn’t
that
what
Xaro
told
you?
Why
do
you
care
what
the
warlocks
whispered?
All
they
wanted
was
to
suck
the
life
from
you,
you
know
that
now.”

“Perhaps,”
she
said
reluctantly.
“Yet
the
things
I
saw…”

“A
dead
man
in
the
prow
of
a
ship,
a
blue
rose,
a
banquet
of
blood…
what
does
any
of
it
mean,
Khaleesi?
A
mummer’s
dragon,
you
said.
What
is
a
mummer’s
dragon,
pray?”

“A
cloth
dragon
on
poles,”
Dany
explained.
“Mummers
use
them
in
their
follies,
to
give
the
heroes
something
to
fight.”

Ser
Jorah
frowned.

Dany
could
not
let
it
go.
“His
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire,
my
brother
said.
I’m
certain
it
was
my
brother.
Not
Viserys,
Rhaegar.
He
had
a
harp
with
silver
strings.”

Ser
Jorah’s
frown
deepened
until
his
eyebrows
came
together.
“Prince
Rhaegar
played
such
a
harp,”
he
conceded.
“You
saw
him?”

She
nodded.
“There
was
a
woman
in
a
bed
with
a
babe
at
her
breast.
My
brother
said
the
babe
was
the
prince
that
was
promised
and
told
her
to
name
him
Aegon.”

“Prince
Aegon
was
Rhaegar’s
heir
by
Elia
of
Dorne,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“But
if
he
was
this
prince
that
was
promised,
the
promise
was
broken
along
with
his
skull
when
the
Lannisters
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.”

“I
remember,”
Dany
said
sadly.
“They
murdered
Rhaegar’s
daughter
as
well,
the
little
princess.
Rhaenys,
she
was
named,
like
Aegon’s
sister.
There
was
no
Visenya,
but
he
said
the
dragon
has
three
heads.
What
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire?”

“It’s
no
song
I’ve
ever
heard.”

“I
went
to
the
warlocks
hoping
for
answers,
but
instead
they’ve
left
me
with
a
hundred
new
questions.”

By
then
there
were
people
in
the
streets
once
more.
“Make
way,”
Aggo
shouted,
while
Jhogo
sniffed
at
the
air
suspiciously.
“I
smell
it,
Khaleesi,”
he
called.
“The
poison
water.”
The
Dothraki
distrusted
the
sea
and
all
that
moved
upon
it.
Water
that
a
horse
could
not
drink
was
water
they
wanted
no
part
of.
They
will
learn,
Dany
resolved.
I
braved
their
sea
with
Khal
Drogo.
Now
they
can
brave
mine.

Qarth
was
one
of
the
world’s
great
ports,
its
great
sheltered
harbor
a
riot
of
color
and
clangor
and
strange
smells.
Winesinks,
warehouses,
and
gaming
dens
lined
the
streets,
cheek
by
jowl
with
cheap
brothels
and
the
temples
of
peculiar
gods.
Cutpurses,
cutthroats,
spellsellers,
and
moneychangers
mingled
with
every
crowd.
The
waterfront
was
one
great
marketplace
where
the
buying
and
selling
went
on
all
day
and
all
night,
and
goods
might
be
had
for
a
fraction
of
what
they
cost
at
the
bazaar,
if
a
man
did
not
ask
where
they
came
from.
Wizened
old
women
bent
like
hunchbacks
sold
flavored
waters
and
goat’s
milk
from
glazed
ceramic
jugs
strapped
to
their
shoulders.
Seamen
from
half
a
hundred
nations
wandered
amongst
the
stalls,
drinking
spiced
liquors
and
trading
jokes
in
queer-sounding
tongues.
The
air
smelled
of
salt
and
frying
fish,
of
hot
tar
and
honey,
of
incense
and
oil
and
sperm.

Aggo
gave
an
urchin
a
copper
for
a
skewer
of
honey-roasted
mice
and
nibbled
them
as
he
rode.
Jhogo
bought
a
handful
of
fat
white
cherries.
Elsewhere
they
saw
beautiful
bronze
daggers
for
sale,
dried
squids
and
carved
onyx,
a
potent
magical
elixir
made
of
virgin’s
milk
and
shade
of
the
evening,
even
dragon’s
eggs
which
looked
suspiciously
like
painted
rocks.

As
they
passed
the
long
stone
quays
reserved
for
the
ships
of
the
Thirteen,
she
saw
chests
of
saffron,
frankincense,
and
pepper
being
off-loaded
from
Xaro’s
ornate
Vermillion
Kiss.
Beside
her,
casks
of
wine,
bales
of
sourleaf,
and
pallets
of
striped
hides
were
being
trundled
up
the
gangplank
onto
the
Bride
in
Azure,
to
sail
on
the
evening
tide.
Farther
along,
a
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
Spicer
galley
Sunblaze
to
bid
on
slaves.
It
was
well
known
that
the
cheapest
place
to
buy
a
slave
was
right
off
the
ship,
and
the
banners
floating
from
her
masts
proclaimed
that
the
Sunblaze
had
just
arrived
from
Astapor
on
Slaver’s
Bay.

Dany
would
get
no
help
from
the
Thirteen,
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood,
or
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers.
She
rode
her
silver
past
several
miles
of
their
quays,
docks,
and
storehouses,
all
the
way
out
to
the
far
end
of
the
horseshoe-shaped
harbor
where
the
ships
from
the
Summer
Islands,
Westeros,
and
the
Nine
Free
Cities
were
permitted
to
dock.

She
dismounted
beside
a
gaming
pit
where
a
basilisk
was
tearing
a
big
red
dog
to
pieces
amidst
a
shouting
ring
of
sailors.
“Aggo,
Jhogo,
you
will
guard
the
horses
while
Ser
Jorah
and
I
speak
to
the
captains.”

“As
you
say,
Khaleesi.
We
will
watch
you
as
you
go.”

It
was
good
to
hear
men
speaking
Valyrian
once
more,
and
even
the
Common
Tongue,
Dany
thought
as
they
approached
the
first
ship.
Sailors,
dockworkers,
and
merchants
alike
gave
way
before
her,
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
slim
young
girl
with
silver-gold
hair
who
dressed
in
the
Dothraki
fashion
and
walked
with
a
knight
at
her
side.
Despite
the
heat
of
the
day,
Ser
Jorah
wore
his
green
wool
surcoat
over
chainmail,
the
black
bear
of
Mormont
sewn
on
his
chest.

But
neither
her
beauty
nor
his
size
and
strength
would
serve
with
the
men
whose
ships
they
needed.

“You
require
passage
for
a
hundred
Dothraki,
all
their
horses,
yourself
and
this
knight,
and
three
dragons?”
said
the
captain
of
the
great
cog
Ardent
Friend
before
he
walked
away
laughing.
When
she
told
a
Lyseni
on
the
Trumpeteer
that
she
was
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Queen
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
he
gave
her
a
deadface
look
and
said,
“Aye,
and
I’m
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
and
shit
gold
every
night.”
The
cargomaster
of
the
Myrish
galley
Silken
Spirit
opined
that
dragons
were
too
dangerous
at
sea,
where
any
stray
breath
of
flame
might
set
the
rigging
afire.
The
owner
of
Lord
Faro’s
Belly
would
risk
dragons,
but
not
Dothraki.
“I’ll
have
no
such
godless
savages
in
my
Belly,
I’ll
not.”
The
two
brothers
who
captained
the
sister
ships
Quicksilver
and
Greyhound
seemed
sympathetic
and
invited
them
into
the
cabin
for
a
glass
of
Arbor
red.
They
were
so
courteous
that
Dany
was
hopeful
for
a
time,
but
in
the
end
the
price
they
asked
was
far
beyond
her
means,
and
might
have
been
beyond
Xaro’s.
Pinchbottom
Petto
and
Sloe-Eyed
Maid
were
too
small
for
her
needs,
Bravo
was
bound
for
the
Jade
Sea,
and
Magister
Manolo
scarce
looked
seaworthy.

As
they
made
their
way
toward
the
next
quay,
Ser
Jorah
laid
a
hand
against
the
small
of
her
back.
“Your
Grace.
You
are
being
followed.
No,
do
not
turn.”
He
guided
her
gently
toward
a
brass-seller’s
booth.
“This
is
a
noble
work,
my
queen,”
he
proclaimed
loudly,
lifting
a
large
platter
for
her
inspection.
“See
how
it
shines
in
the
sun?”

The
brass
was
polished
to
a
high
sheen.
Dany
could
see
her
face
in
it…
and
when
Ser
Jorah
angled
it
to
the
right,
she
could
see
behind
her.
“I
see
a
fat
brown
man
and
an
older
man
with
a
staff.
Which
is
it?”

“Both
of
them,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“They
have
been
following
us
since
we
left
Quicksilver.”

The
ripples
in
the
brass
stretched
the
strangers
queerly,
making
one
man
seem
long
and
gaunt,
the
other
immensely
squat
and
broad.
“A
most
excellent
brass,
great
lady,”
the
merchant
exclaimed.
“Bright
as
the
sun!
And
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
only
thirty
honors.”

The
platter
was
worth
no
more
than
three.
“Where
are
my
guards?”
Dany
declared.
“This
man
is
trying
to
rob
me!”
For
Jorah,
she
lowered
her
voice
and
spoke
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“They
may
not
mean
me
ill.
Men
have
looked
at
women
since
time
began,
perhaps
it
is
no
more
than
that.”

The
brass-seller
ignored
their
whispers.
“Thirty?
Did
I
say
thirty?
Such
a
fool
I
am.
The
price
is
twenty
honors.”

“All
the
brass
in
this
booth
is
not
worth
twenty
honors,”
Dany
told
him
as
she
studied
the
reflections.
The
old
man
had
the
look
of
Westeros
about
him,
and
the
brown-skinned
one
must
weigh
twenty
stone.
The
Usurper
offered
a
lordship
to
the
man
who
kills
me,
and
these
two
are
far
from
home.
Or
could
they
be
creatures
of
the
warlocks,
meant
to
take
me
unawares?

“Ten,
Khaleesi,
because
you
are
so
lovely.
Use
it
for
a
looking
glass.
Only
brass
this
fine
could
capture
such
beauty.”

“It
might
serve
to
carry
nightsoil.
If
you
threw
it
away,
I
might
pick
it
up,
so
long
as
I
did
not
need
to
stoop.
But
pay
for
it?”
Dany
shoved
the
platter
back
into
his
hands.
“Worms
have
crawled
up
your
nose
and
eaten
your
wits.”

“Eight
honors,”
he
cried.
“My
wives
will
beat
me
and
call
me
fool,
but
I
am
a
helpless
child
in
your
hands.
Come,
eight,
that
is
less
than
it
is
worth.”

“What
do
I
need
with
dull
brass
when
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
feeds
me
off
plates
of
gold?”
As
she
turned
to
walk
off,
Dany
let
her
glance
sweep
over
the
strangers.
The
brown
man
was
near
as
wide
as
he’d
looked
in
the
platter,
with
a
gleaming
bald
head
and
the
smooth
cheeks
of
a
eunuch.
A
long
curving
arakh
was
thrust
through
the
sweat-stained
yellow
silk
of
his
bellyband.
Above
the
silk,
he
was
naked
but
for
an
absurdly
tiny
iron-studded
vest.
Old
scars
crisscrossed
his
tree-trunk
arms,
huge
chest,
and
massive
belly,
pale
against
his
nut-brown
skin.

The
other
man
wore
a
traveler’s
cloak
of
undyed
wool,
the
hood
thrown
back.
Long
white
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders,
and
a
silky
white
beard
covered
the
lower
half
of
his
face.
He
leaned
his
weight
on
a
hardwood
staff
as
tall
as
he
was.
Only
fools
would
stare
so
openly
if
they
meant
me
harm.
All
the
same,
it
might
be
prudent
to
head
back
toward
Jhogo
and
Aggo.
“The
old
man
does
not
wear
a
sword,”
she
said
to
Jorah
in
the
Common
Tongue
as
she
drew
him
away.

The
brass
merchant
came
hopping
after
them.
“Five
honors,
for
five
it
is
yours,
it
was
meant
for
you.”

Ser
Jorah
said,
“A
hardwood
staff
can
crack
a
skull
as
well
as
any
mace.”

“Four!
I
know
you
want
it!”
He
danced
in
front
of
them,
scampering
backward
as
he
thrust
the
platter
at
their
faces.

“Do
they
follow?”

“Lift
that
up
a
little
higher,”
the
knight
told
the
merchant.
“Yes.
The
old
man
pretends
to
linger
at
a
potter’s
stall,
but
the
brown
one
has
eyes
only
for
you.”

“Two
honors!
Two!
Two!”
The
merchant
was
panting
heavily
from
the
effort
of
running
backward.

“Pay
him
before
he
kills
himself,”
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah,
wondering
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
a
huge
brass
platter.
She
turned
back
as
he
reached
for
his
coins,
intending
to
put
an
end
to
this
mummer’s
farce.
The
blood
of
the
dragon
would
not
be
herded
through
the
bazaar
by
an
old
man
and
a
fat
eunuch.

A
Qartheen
stepped
into
her
path.
“Mother
of
Dragons,
for
you.”
He
knelt
and
thrust
a
jewel
box
into
her
face.

Dany
took
it
almost
by
reflex.
The
box
was
carved
wood,
its
mother-of-pearl
lid
inlaid
with
jasper
and
chalcedony.
“You
are
too
generous.”
She
opened
it.
Within
was
a
glittering
green
scarab
carved
from
onyx
and
emerald.
Beautiful,
she
thought.
This
will
help
pay
for
our
passage.
As
she
reached
inside
the
box,
the
man
said,
“I
am
so
sorry,”
but
she
hardly
heard.

The
scarab
unfolded
with
a
hiss.

Dany
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
malign
black
face,
almost
human,
and
an
arched
tail
dripping
venom…
and
then
the
box
flew
from
her
hand
in
pieces,
turning
end
over
end.
Sudden
pain
twisted
her
fingers.
As
she
cried
out
and
clutched
her
hand,
the
brass
merchant
let
out
a
shriek,
a
woman
screamed,
and
suddenly
the
Qartheen
were
shouting
and
pushing
each
other
aside.
Ser
Jorah
slammed
past
her,
and
Dany
stumbled
to
one
knee.
She
heard
the
hiss
again.
The
old
man
drove
the
butt
of
his
staff
into
the
ground,
Aggo
came
riding
through
an
eggseller’s
stall
and
vaulted
from
his
saddle,
Jhogo’s
whip
cracked
overhead,
Ser
Jorah
slammed
the
eunuch
over
the
head
with
the
brass
platter,
sailors
and
whores
and
merchants
were
fleeing
or
shouting
or
both…

“Your
Grace,
a
thousand
pardons.”
The
old
man
knelt.
“It’s
dead.
Did
I
break
your
hand?”

She
closed
her
fingers,
wincing.
“I
don’t
think
so.”

“I
had
to
knock
it
away,”
he
started,
but
her
bloodriders
were
on
him
before
he
could
finish.
Aggo
kicked
his
staff
away
and
Jhogo
seized
him
round
the
shoulders,
forced
him
to
his
knees,
and
pressed
a
dagger
to
his
throat.
“Khaleesi,
we
saw
him
strike
you.
Would
you
see
the
color
of
his
blood?”

“Release
him.”
Dany
climbed
to
her
feet.
“Look
at
the
bottom
of
his
staff,
blood
of
my
blood.”
Ser
Jorah
had
been
shoved
off
his
feet
by
the
eunuch.
She
ran
between
them
as
arakh
and
longsword
both
came
flashing
from
their
sheaths.
“Put
down
your
steel!
Stop
it!”

“Your
Grace?”
Mormont
lowered
his
sword
only
an
inch.
“These
men
attacked
you.”

“They
were
defending
me.”
Dany
snapped
her
hand
to
shake
the
sting
from
her
fingers.
“It
was
the
other
one,
the
Qartheen.”
When
she
looked
around
he
was
gone.
“He
was
a
Sorrowful
Man.
There
was
a
manticore
in
that
jewel
box
he
gave
me.
This
man
knocked
it
out
of
my
hand.”
The
brass
merchant
was
still
rolling
on
the
ground.
She
went
to
him
and
helped
him
to
his
feet.
“Were
you
stung?”

“No,
good
lady,”
he
said,
shaking,
“or
else
I
would
be
dead.
But
it
touched
me,
aieeee,
when
it
fell
from
the
box
it
landed
on
my
arm.”
He
had
soiled
himself,
she
saw,
and
no
wonder.

She
gave
him
a
silver
for
his
trouble
and
sent
him
on
his
way
before
she
turned
back
to
the
old
man
with
the
white
beard.
“Who
is
it
that
I
owe
my
life
to?”

“You
owe
me
nothing,
Your
Grace.
I
am
called
Arstan,
though
Belwas
named
me
Whitebeard
on
the
voyage
here.”
Though
Jhogo
had
released
him
the
old
man
remained
on
one
knee.
Aggo
picked
up
his
staff,
turned
it
over,
cursed
softly
in
Dothraki,
scraped
the
remains
of
the
manticore
off
on
a
stone,
and
handed
it
back.

“And
who
is
Belwas?”
she
asked.

The
huge
brown
eunuch
swaggered
forward,
sheathing
his
arakh.
“I
am
Belwas.
Strong
Belwas
they
name
me
in
the
fighting
pits
of
Meereen.
Never
did
I
lose.”
He
slapped
his
belly,
covered
with
scars.
“I
let
each
man
cut
me
once,
before
I
kill
him.
Count
the
cuts
and
you
will
know
how
many
Strong
Belwas
has
slain.”

Dany
had
no
need
to
count
his
scars;
there
were
many,
she
could
see
at
a
glance.
“And
why
are
you
here,
Strong
Belwas?”

“From
Meereen
I
am
sold
to
Qohor,
and
then
to
Pentos
and
the
fat
man
with
sweet
stink
in
his
hair.
He
it
was
who
send
Strong
Belwas
back
across
the
sea,
and
old
Whitebeard
to
serve
him.”

The
fat
man
with
sweet
stink
in
his
hair…“Illyrio?”
she
said.
“You
were
sent
by
Magister
Illyrio?”

“We
were,
Your
Grace,”
old
Whitebeard
replied.
“The
Magister
begs
your
kind
indulgence
for
sending
us
in
his
stead,
but
he
cannot
sit
a
horse
as
he
did
in
his
youth,
and
sea
travel
upsets
his
digestion.”
Earlier
he
had
spoken
in
the
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
but
now
he
changed
to
the
Common
Tongue.
“I
regret
if
we
caused
you
alarm.
If
truth
be
told,
we
were
not
certain,
we
expected
someone
more…
more…”

“Regal?”
Dany
laughed.
She
had
no
dragon
with
her,
and
her
raiment
was
hardly
queenly.
“You
speak
the
Common
Tongue
well,
Arstan.
Are
you
of
Westeros?”

“I
am.
I
was
born
on
the
Dornish
Marches,
Your
Grace.
As
a
boy
I
squired
for
a
knight
of
Lord
Swann’s
household.”
He
held
the
tall
staff
upright
beside
him
like
a
lance
in
need
of
a
banner.
“Now
I
squire
for
Belwas.”

“A
bit
old
for
such,
aren’t
you?”
Ser
Jorah
had
shouldered
his
way
to
her
side,
holding
the
brass
platter
awkwardly
under
his
arm.
Belwas’s
hard
head
had
left
it
badly
bent.

“Not
too
old
to
serve
my
liege,
Lord
Mormont.”

“You
know
me
as
well?”

“I
saw
you
fight
a
time
or
two.
At
Lannisport
where
you
near
unhorsed
the
Kingslayer.
And
on
Pyke,
there
as
well.
You
do
not
recall,
Lord
Mormont?”

Ser
Jorah
frowned.
“Your
face
seems
familiar,
but
there
were
hundreds
at
Lannisport
and
thousands
on
Pyke.
And
I
am
no
lord.
Bear
Island
was
taken
from
me.
I
am
but
a
knight.”

“A
knight
of
my
Queensguard.”
Dany
took
his
arm.
“And
my
true
friend
and
good
counselor.”
She
studied
Arstan’s
face.
He
had
a
great
dignity
to
him,
a
quiet
strength
she
liked.
“Rise,
Arstan
Whitebeard.
Be
welcome,
Strong
Belwas.
Ser
Jorah
you
know.
Ko
Aggo
and
Ko
Jhogo
are
blood
of
my
blood.
They
crossed
the
red
waste
with
me,
and
saw
my
dragons
born.”

“Horse
boys.”
Belwas
grinned
toothily.
“Belwas
has
killed
many
horse
boys
in
the
fighting
pits.
They
jingle
when
they
die.”

Aggo’s
arakh
leapt
to
his
hand.
“Never
have
I
killed
a
fat
brown
man.
Belwas
will
be
the
first.”

“Sheath
your
steel,
blood
of
my
blood,”
said
Dany,
“this
man
comes
to
serve
me.
Belwas,
you
will
accord
all
respect
to
my
people,
or
you
will
leave
my
service
sooner
than
you’d
wish,
and
with
more
scars
than
when
you
came.”

The
gap-toothed
smile
faded
from
the
giant’s
broad
brown
face,
replaced
by
a
confused
scowl.
Men
did
not
often
threaten
Belwas,
it
would
seem,
and
less
so
girls
a
third
his
size.

Dany
gave
him
a
smile,
to
take
a
bit
of
the
sting
from
the
rebuke.
“Now
tell
me,
what
would
Magister
Illyrio
have
of
me,
that
he
would
send
you
all
the
way
from
Pentos?”

“He
would
have
dragons,”
said
Belwas
gruffly,
“and
the
girl
who
makes
them.
He
would
have
you.”

“Belwas
has
the
truth
of
us,
Your
Grace,”
said
Arstan.
“We
were
told
to
find
you
and
bring
you
back
to
Pentos.
The
Seven
Kingdoms
have
need
of
you.
Robert
the
Usurper
is
dead,
and
the
realm
bleeds.
When
we
set
sail
from
Pentos
there
were
four
kings
in
the
land,
and
no
justice
to
be
had.”

Joy
bloomed
in
her
heart,
but
Dany
kept
it
from
her
face.
“I
have
three
dragons,”
she
said,
“and
more
than
a
hundred
in
my
khalasar,
with
all
their
goods
and
horses.”

“it
is
no
matter,”
boomed
Belwas.
“We
take
all.
The
fat
man
hires
three
ships
for
his
little
silverhair
queen.”

“It
is
so,
Your
Grace,”
Arstan
Whitebeard
said.
“The
great
cog
Saduleon
is
berthed
at
the
end
of
the
quay,
and
the
galleys
Summer
Sun
and
Joso’s
Prank
are
anchored
beyond
the
breakwater.”

Three
heads
has
the
dragon,
Dany
thought,
wondering.
“I
shall
tell
my
people
to
make
ready
to
depart
at
once.
But
the
ships
that
bring
me
home
must
bear
different
names.”

“As
you
wish,”
said
Arstan.
“What
names
would
you
prefer?”

“Vhagar,”
Daenerys
told
him.
“Meraxes.
And
Balerion.
Paint
the
names
on
their
hulls
in
golden
letters
three
feet
high,
Arstan.
I
want
every
man
who
sees
them
to
know
the
dragons
are
returned.”





ARYA

The
heads
had
been
dipped
in
tar
to
slow
the
rot.
Every
morning
when
Arya
went
to
the
well
to
draw
fresh
water
for
Roose
Bolton’s
basin,
she
had
to
pass
beneath
them.
They
faced
outward,
so
she
never
saw
their
faces,
but
she
liked
to
pretend
that
one
of
them
was
Joffrey’s.
She
tried
to
picture
how
his
pretty
face
would
look
dipped
in
tar.
If
I
was
a
crow
I
could
fly
down
and
peck
off
his
stupid
fat
pouty
lips.

The
heads
never
lacked
for
attendants.
The
carrion
crows
wheeled
about
the
gatehouse
in
raucous
unkindness
and
quarreled
upon
the
ramparts
over
every
eye,
screaming
and
cawing
at
each
other
and
taking
to
the
air
whenever
a
sentry
passed
along
the
battlements.
Sometimes
the
maester’s
ravens
joined
the
feast
as
well,
flapping
down
from
the
rookery
on
wide
black
wings.
When
the
ravens
came
the
crows
would
scatter,
only
to
return
the
moment
the
larger
birds
were
gone.

Do
the
ravens
remember
Maester
Tothmure?
Arya
wondered.
Are
they
sad
for
him?
When
they
quork
at
him,
do
they
wonder
why
he
doesn’t
answer?
Perhaps
the
dead
could
speak
to
them
in
some
secret
tongue
the
living
could
not
hear.

Tothmure
had
been
sent
to
the
axe
for
dispatching
birds
to
Casterly
Rock
and
King’s
Landing
the
night
Harrenhal
had
fallen,
Lucan
the
armorer
for
making
weapons
for
the
Lannisters,
Goodwife
Harra
for
telling
Lady
Whent’s
household
to
serve
them,
the
steward
for
giving
Lord
Tywin
the
keys
to
the
treasure
vault.
The
cook
was
spared
(some
said
because
he’d
made
the
weasel
soup),
but
stocks
were
hammered
together
for
pretty
Pia
and
the
other
women
who’d
shared
their
favors
with
Lannister
soldiers.
Stripped
and
shaved,
they
were
left
in
the
middle
ward
beside
the
bear
pit,
free
for
the
use
of
any
man
who
wanted
them.

Three
Frey
men-at-arms
were
using
them
that
morning
as
Arya
went
to
the
well.
She
tried
not
to
look,
but
she
could
hear
the
men
laughing.
The
pail
was
very
heavy
once
full.
She
was
turning
to
bring
it
back
to
Kingspyre
when
Goodwife
Amabel
seized
her
arm.
The
water
went
sloshing
over
the
side
onto
Amabel’s
legs.
“You
did
that
on
purpose,”
the
woman
screeched.

“What
do
you
want?”
Arya
squirmed
in
her
grasp.
Amabel
had
been
half-crazed
since
they’d
cut
Harra’s
head
off.

“See
there?”
Arnabel
pointed
across
the
yard
at
Pia.
“When
this
northman
falls
you’ll
be
where
she
is.”

“Let
me
go.”
She
tried
to
wrench
free,
but
Amabel
only
tightened
her
fingers.

“He
will
fall
too,
Harrenhal
pulls
them
all
down
in
the
end.
Lord
Tywin’s
won
now,
he’ll
be
marching
back
with
all
his
power,
and
then
it
will
be
his
turn
to
punish
the
disloyal.
And
don’t
think
he
won’t
know
what
you
did!”
The
old
woman
laughed.
“I
may
have
a
turn
at
you
myself.
Harra
had
an
old
broom,
I’ll
save
it
for
you.
The
handle’s
cracked
and
splintery—”

Arya
swung
the
bucket.
The
weight
of
the
water
made
it
turn
in
her
hands,
so
she
didn’t
smash
Amabel’s
head
in
as
she
wanted,
but
the
woman
let
go
of
her
anyway
when
the
water
came
out
and
drenched
her.
“Don’t
ever
touch
me,”
Arya
shouted,
“or
I’ll
kill
you.
You
get
away.”

Sopping,
Goodwife
Amabel
jabbed
a
thin
finger
at
the
flayed
man
on
the
front
of
Arya’s
tunic.
“You
think
you’re
safe
with
that
little
bloody
man
on
your
teat,
but
you’re
not!
The
Lannisters
are
coming!
See
what
happens
when
they
get
here.”

Three-quarters
of
the
water
had
splashed
out
on
the
ground,
so
Arya
had
to
return
to
the
well.
If
I
told
Lord
Bolton
what
she
said,
her
head
would
be
up
next
to
Harra’s
before
it
got
dark,
she
thought
as
she
drew
up
the
bucket
again.
She
wouldn’t,
though.

Once,
when
there
had
been
only
half
as
many
heads,
Gendry
had
caught
Arya
looking
at
them.
“Admiring
your
work?”
he
asked.

He
was
angry
because
he’d
liked
Lucan,
she
knew,
but
it
still
wasn’t
fair.
“It’s
Steelshanks
Walton’s
work,”
she
said
defensively.
“And
the
Mummers,
and
Lord
Bolton.”

“And
who
gave
us
all
them?
You
and
your
weasel
soup.”

Arya
punched
his
arm.
“It
was
just
hot
broth.
You
hated
Ser
Amory
too.”

“I
hate
this
lot
worse.
Ser
Amory
was
fighting
for
his
lord,
but
the
Mummers
are
sellswords
and
turncloaks.
Half
of
them
can’t
even
speak
the
Common
Tongue.
Septon
Utt
likes
little
boys,
Qyburn
does
black
magic,
and
your
friend
Biter
eats
people.”

The
worst
thing
was,
she
couldn’t
even
say
he
was
wrong.
The
Brave
Companions
did
most
of
the
foraging
for
Harrenhal,
and
Roose
Bolton
had
given
them
the
task
of
rooting
out
Lannisters.
Vargo
Hoat
had
divided
them
into
four
bands,
to
visit
as
many
villages
as
possible.
He
led
the
largest
group
himself,
and
gave
the
others
to
his
most
trusted
captains.
She
had
heard
Rorge
laughing
over
Lord
Vargo’s
way
of
finding
traitors.
All
he
did
was
return
to
places
he
had
visited
before
under
Lord
Tywin’s
banner
and
seize
those
who
had
helped
him.
Many
had
been
bought
with
Lannister
silver,
so
the
Mummers
often
returned
with
bags
of
coin
as
well
as
baskets
of
heads.
“A
riddle!”
Shagwell
would
shout
gleefully.
“If
Lord
Bolton’s
goat
eats
the
men
who
fed
Lord
Lannister’s
goat,
how
many
goats
are
there?”

“One,”
Arya
said
when
he
asked
her.

“Now
there’s
a
weasel
clever
as
a
goat!”
the
fool
tittered.

Rorge
and
Biter
were
as
bad
as
the
others.
Whenever
Lord
Bolton
took
a
meal
with
the
garrison,
Arya
would
see
them
there
among
the
rest.
Biter
gave
off
a
stench
like
bad
cheese,
so
the
Brave
Companions
made
him
sit
down
near
the
foot
of
the
table
where
he
could
grunt
and
hiss
to
himself
and
tear
his
meat
apart
with
fingers
and
teeth.
He
would
sniff
at
Arya
when
she
passed,
but
it
was
Rorge
who
scared
her
most.
He
sat
up
near
Faithful
Ursywck,
but
she
could
feel
his
eyes
crawling
over
her
as
she
went
about
her
duties.

Sometimes
she
wished
she
had
gone
off
across
the
narrow
sea
with
Jaqen
H’ghar.
She
still
had
the
stupid
coin
he’d
given
her,
a
piece
of
iron
no
larger
than
a
penny
and
rusted
along
the
rim.
One
side
had
writing
on
it,
queer
words
she
could
not
read.
The
other
showed
a
man’s
head,
but
so
worn
that
all
his
features
had
rubbed
off.
He
said
it
was
of
great
value,
but
that
was
probably
a
lie
too,
like
his
name
and
even
his
face.
That
made
her
so
angry
that
she
threw
the
coin
away,
but
after
an
hour
she
got
to
feeling
bad
and
went
and
found
it
again,
even
though
it
wasn’t
worth
anything.

She
was
thinking
about
the
coin
as
she
crossed
the
Flowstone
Yard,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
the
water
in
her
pail.
“Nan,”
a
voice
called
out.
“Put
down
that
pail
and
come
help
me.”

Elmar
Frey
was
no
older
than
she
was,
and
short
for
his
age
besides.
He
had
been
rolling
a
barrel
of
sand
across
the
uneven
stone,
and
was
red-faced
from
exertion.
Arya
went
to
help
him.
Together
they
pushed
the
barrel
all
=======
scarecrow
of
a
man
with
a
rat’s
face
and
frayed
beard,
clad
in
a
mail
shirt
and
a
leather
half
cape.
“No
talking,”
he
said
as
he
wrenched
the
jug
from
Ned’s
hands.

“Please,”
Ned
said,
“my
daughters…”
The
door
crashed
shut.
He
blinked
as
the
light
vanished,
lowered
his
head
to
his
chest,
and
curled
up
on
the
straw.
It
no
longer
stank
of
urine
and
shit.
It
no
longer
smelled
at
all.

He
could
no
longer
tell
the
difference
between
waking
and
sleeping.
The
memory
came
creeping
upon
him
in
the
darkness,
as
vivid
as
a
dream.
It
was
the
year
of
false
spring,
and
he
was
eighteen
again,
down
from
the
Eyrie
to
the
tourney
at
Harrenhal.
He
could
see
the
deep
green
of
the
grass,
and
smell
the
pollen
on
the
wind.
Warm
days
and
cool
nights
and
the
sweet
taste
of
wine.
He
remembered
Brandon’s
laughter,
and
Robert’s
berserk
valor
in
the
melee,
the
way
he
laughed
as
he
unhorsed
men
left
and
right.
He
remembered
Jaime
Lannister,
a
golden
youth
in
scaled
white
armor,
kneeling
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
king’s
pavilion
and
making
his
vows
to
protect
and
defend
King
Aerys.
Afterward,
Ser
Oswell
Whent
helped
Jaime
to
his
feet,
and
the
White
Bull
himself,
Lord
Commander
Ser
Gerold
Hightower,
fastened
the
snowy
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
about
his
shoulders.
All
six
White
Swords
were
there
to
welcome
their
newest
brother.

Yet
when
the
jousting
began,
the
day
belonged
to
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
The
crown
prince
wore
the
armor
he
would
die
in:
gleaming
black
plate
with
the
three-headed
dragon
of
his
House
wrought
in
rubies
on
the
breast.
A
plume
of
scarlet
silk
streamed
behind
him
when
he
rode,
and
it
seemed
no
lance
could
touch
him.
Brandon
fell
to
him,
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce,
and
even
the
splendid
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.

Robert
had
been
jesting
with
Jon
and
old
Lord
Hunter
as
the
prince
circled
the
field
after
unhorsing
Ser
Barristan
in
the
final
tilt
to
claim
the
champion’s
crown.
Ned
remembered
the
moment
when
all
the
smiles
died,
when
Prince
Rhaegar
Targaryen
urged
his
horse
past
his
own
wife,
the
Dornish
princess
Elia
Martell,
to
lay
the
queen
of
beauty’s
laurel
in
Lyanna’s
lap.
He
could
see
it
still:
a
crown
of
winter
roses,
blue
as
frost.

Ned
Stark
reached
out
his
hand
to
grasp
the
flowery
crown,
but
beneath
the
pale
blue
petals
the
thorns
lay
hidden.
He
felt
them
clawing
at
his
skin,
sharp
and
cruel,
saw
the
slow
trickle
of
blood
run
down
his
fingers,
and
woke,
trembling,
in
the
dark.

Promise
me,
Ned,
his
sister
had
whispered
from
her
bed
of
blood.
She
had
loved
the
scent
of
winter
roses.

“Gods
save
me,”
Ned
wept.
“I
am
going
mad.”

The
gods
did
not
deign
to
answer.

Each
time
the
turnkey
brought
him
water,
he
told
himself
another
day
had
passed.
At
first
he
would
beg
the
man
for
some
word
of
his
daughters
and
the
world
beyond
his
cell.
Grunts
and
kicks
were
his
only
replies.
Later,
when
the
stomach
cramps
began,
he
begged
for
food
instead.
It
made
no
matter;
he
was
not
fed.
Perhaps
the
Lannisters
meant
for
him
to
starve
to
death.
“No,”
he
told
himself.
If
Cersei
had
wanted
him
dead,
he
would
have
been
cut
down
in
the
throne
room
with
his
men.
She
wanted
him
alive.
Weak,
desperate,
yet
alive.
Catelyn
held
her
brother;
she
dare
not
kill
him
or
the
Imp’s
life
would
be
forfeit
as
well.

From
outside
his
cell
came
the
rattle
of
iron
chains.
As
the
door
creaked
open,
Ned
put
a
hand
to
the
damp
wall
and
pushed
himself
toward
the
light.
The
glare
of
a
torch
made
him
squint.
“Food,”
he
croaked.

“Wine,”
a
voice
answered.
It
was
not
the
rat-faced
man;
this
gaoler
was
stouter,
shorter,
though
he
wore
the
same
leather
half
cape
and
spiked
steel
cap.
“Drink,
Lord
Eddard.”
He
thrust
a
wineskin
into
Ned’s
hands.

The
voice
was
strangely
familiar,
yet
it
took
Ned
Stark
a
moment
to
place
it.
“Varys?”
he
said
groggily
when
it
came.
He
touched
the
man’s
face.
“I’m
not…
not
dreaming
this.
You’re
here.”
The
eunuch’s
plump
cheeks
were
covered
with
a
dark
stubble
of
beard.
Ned
felt
the
coarse
hair
with
his
fingers.
Varys
had
transformed
himself
into
a
grizzled
turnkey,
reeking
of
sweat
and
sour
wine.
“How
did
you…
what
sort
of
magician
are
you?”

“A
thirsty
one,”
Varys
said.
“Drink,
my
lord.”

Ned’s
hands
fumbled
at
the
skin.
“Is
this
the
same
poison
they
gave
Robert?”

“You
wrong
me,”
Varys
said
sadly.
“Truly,
no
one
loves
a
eunuch.
Give
me
the
skin.”
He
drank,
a
trickle
of
red
leaking
from
the
corner
of
his
plump
mouth.
“Not
the
equal
of
the
vintage
you
offered
me
the
night
of
the
tourney,
but
no
more
poisonous
than
most,”
he
concluded,
wiping
his
lips.
“Here.”

Ned
tried
a
swallow.
“Dregs.”
He
felt
as
though
he
were
about
to
bring
the
wine
back
up.

“All
men
must
swallow
the
sour
with
the
sweet.
High
lords
and
eunuchs
alike.
Your
hour
has
come,
my
lord.”

“My
daughters…”

“The
younger
girl
escaped
Ser
Meryn
and
fled,”
Varys
told
him.
“I
have
not
been
able
to
find
her.
Nor
have
the
Lannisters.
A
kindness,
there.
Our
new
king
loves
her
not.
Your
older
girl
is
still
betrothed
to
Joffrey.
Cersei
keeps
her
close.
She
came
to
court
a
few
days
ago
to
plead
that
you
be
spared.
A
pity
you
couldn’t
have
been
there,
you
would
have
been
touched.”
He
leaned
forward
intently.
“I
trust
you
realize
that
you
are
a
dead
man,
Lord
Eddard?”

“The
queen
will
not
kill
me,”
Ned
said.
His
head
swam;
the
wine
was
strong,
and
it
had
been
too
long
since
he’d
eaten.
“Cat…
Cat
holds
her
brother…”

“The
wrong
brother,”
Varys
sighed.
“And
lost
to
her,
in
any
case.
She
let
the
Imp
slip
through
her
fingers.
I
expect
he
is
dead
by
now,
somewhere
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.”

“If
that
is
true,
slit
my
throat
and
have
done
with
it.”
He
was
dizzy
from
the
wine,
tired
and
heartsick.

“Your
blood
is
the
last
thing
I
desire.”

Ned
frowned.
“When
they
slaughtered
my
guard,
you
stood
beside
the
queen
and
watched,
and
said
not
a
word.”

“And
would
again.
I
seem
to
recall
that
I
was
unarmed,
unarmored,
and
surrounded
by
Lannister
swords.”
The
eunuch
looked
at
him
curiously,
tilting
his
head.
“When
I
was
a
young
boy,
before
I
was
cut,
I
traveled
with
a
troupe
of
mummers
through
the
Free
Cities.
They
taught
me
that
each
man
has
a
role
to
play,
in
life
as
well
as
mummery.
So
it
is
at
court.
The
King’s
Justice
must
be
fearsome,
the
master
of
coin
must
be
frugal,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
must
be
valiant…
and
the
master
of
whisperers
must
be
sly
and
obsequious
and
without
scruple.
A
courageous
informer
would
be
as
useless
as
a
cowardly
knight.”
He
took
the
wineskin
back
and
drank.

Ned
studied
the
eunuch’s
face,
searching
for
truth
beneath
the
mummer’s
scars
and
false
stubble.
He
tried
some
more
wine.
This
time
it
went
down
easier.
“Can
you
free
me
from
this
pit?”

“I
could…
but
will
I?
No.
Questions
would
be
asked,
and
the
answers
would
lead
back
to
me.”

Ned
had
expected
no
more.
“You
are
blunt.”

“A
eunuch
has
no
honor,
and
a
spider
does
not
enjoy
the
luxury
of
scruples,
my
lord.”

“Would
you
at
least
consent
to
carry
a
message
out
for
me?”

“That
would
depend
on
the
message.
I
will
gladly
provide
you
with
paper
and
ink,
if
you
like.
And
when
you
have
written
what
you
will,
I
will
take
the
letter
and
read
it,
and
deliver
it
or
not,
as
best
serves
my
own
ends.”

“Your
own
ends.
What
ends
are
those,
Lord
Varys?”

“Peace,”
Varys
replied
without
hesitation.
“If
there
was
one
soul
in
King’s
Landing
who
was
truly
desperate
to
keep
Robert
Baratheon
alive,
it
was
me.”
He
sighed.
“For
fifteen
years
I
protected
him
from
his
enemies,
but
I
could
not
protect
him
from
his
friends.
What
strange
fit
of
madness
led
you
to
tell
the
queen
that
you
had
learned
the
truth
of
Joffrey’s
birth?”

“The
madness
of
mercy,”
Ned
admitted.

“Ah,”
said
Varys.
“To
be
sure.
You
are
an
honest
and
honorable
man,
Lord
Eddard.
Ofttimes
I
forget
that.
I
have
met
so
few
of
them
in
my
life.”
He
glanced
around
the
cell.
“When
I
see
what
honesty
and
honor
have
won
you,
I
understand
why.”

Ned
Stark
laid
his
head
back
against
the
damp
stone
wall
and
closed
his
eyes.
His
leg
was
throbbing.
“The
king’s
wine…
did
you
question
Lancel?”

“Oh,
indeed.
Cersei
gave
him
the
wineskins,
and
told
him
it
was
Robert’s
favorite
vintage.”
The
eunuch
shrugged.
“A
hunter
lives
a
perilous
life.
If
the
boar
had
not
done
for
Robert,
it
would
have
been
a
fall
from
a
horse,
the
bite
of
a
wood
adder,
an
arrow
gone
astray…
the
forest
is
the
abbatoir
of
the
gods.
It
was
not
wine
that
killed
the
king.
It
was
your
mercy.”

Ned
had
feared
as
much.
“Gods
forgive
me.”

“If
there
are
gods,”
Varys
said,
“I
expect
they
will.
The
queen
would
not
have
waited
long
in
any
case.
Robert
was
becoming
unruly,
and
she
needed
to
be
rid
of
him
to
free
her
hands
to
deal
with
his
brothers.
They
are
quite
a
pair,
Stannis
and
Renly.
The
iron
gauntlet
and
the
silk
glove.”
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“You
have
been
foolish,
my
lord.
You
ought
to
have
heeded
Littlefinger
when
he
urged
you
to
support
Joffrey’s
succession.”

“How…
how
could
you
know
of
that?”

Varys
smiled.
“I
know,
that’s
all
that
need
concern
you.
I
also
know
that
on
the
morrow
the
queen
will
pay
you
a
visit.”

Slowly
Ned
raised
his
eyes.
“Why?”

“Cersei
is
frightened
of
you,
my
lord…
but
she
has
other
enemies
she
fears
even
more.
Her
beloved
Jaime
is
fighting
the
river
lords
even
now.
Lysa
Arryn
sits
in
the
Eyrie,
ringed
in
stone
and
steel,
and
there
is
no
love
lost
between
her
and
the
queen.
In
Dorne,
the
Martells
still
brood
on
the
murder
of
Princess
Elia
and
her
babes.
And
now
your
son
marches
down
the
Neck
with
a
northern
host
at
his
back.”

“Robb
is
only
a
boy,”
Ned
said,
aghast.

“A
boy
with
an
army,”
Varys
said.
“Yet
only
a
boy,
as
you
say.
The
king’s
brothers
are
the
ones
giving
Cersei
sleepless
nights…
Lord
Stannis
in
particular.
His
claim
is
the
true
one,
he
is
known
for
his
prowess
as
a
battle
commander,
and
he
is
utterly
without
mercy.
There
is
no
creature
on
earth
half
so
terrifying
as
a
truly
just
man.
No
one
knows
what
Stannis
has
been
doing
on
Dragonstone,
but
I
will
wager
you
that
he’s
gathered
more
swords
than
seashells.
So
here
is
Cersei’s
nightmare:
while
her
father
and
brother
spend
their
power
battling
Starks
and
Tullys,
Lord
Stannis
will
land,
proclaim
himself
king,
and
lop
off
her
son’s
curly
blond
head…
and
her
own
in
the
bargain,
though
I
truly
believe
she
cares
more
about
the
boy.”

“Stannis
Baratheon
is
Robert’s
true
heir,”
Ned
said.
“The
throne
is
his
by
rights.
I
would
welcome
his
ascent.”

Varys
tsked.
“Cersei
will
not
want
to
hear
that,
I
promise
you.
Stannis
may
win
the
throne,
but
only
your
rotting
head
will
remain
to
cheer
unless
you
guard
that
tongue
of
yours.
Sansa
begged
so
sweetly,
it
would
be
a
shame
if
you
threw
it
all
away.
You
are
being
given
your
life
back,
if
you’ll
take
it.
Cersei
is
no
fool.
She
knows
a
tame
wolf
is
of
more
use
than
a
dead
one.”

“You
want
me
to
serve
the
woman
who
murdered
my
king,
butchered
my
men,
and
crippled
my
son?”
Ned’s
voice
was
thick
with
disbelief.

“I
want
you
to
serve
the
realm,”
Varys
said.
“Tell
the
queen
that
you
will
confess
your
vile
treason,
command
your
son
to
lay
down
his
sword,
and
proclaim
Joffrey
as
the
true
heir.
Offer
to
denounce
Stannis
and
Renly
as
faithless
usurpers.
Our
green-eyed
lioness
knows
you
are
a
man
of
honor.
If
you
will
give
her
the
peace
she
needs
and
the
time
to
deal
with
Stannis,
and
pledge
to
carry
her
secret
to
your
grave,
I
believe
she
will
allow
you
to
take
the
black
and
live
out
the
rest
of
your
days
on
the
Wall,
with
your
brother
and
that
baseborn
son
of
yours.”

The
thought
of
Jon
filled
Ned
with
a
sense
of
shame,
and
a
sorrow
too
deep
for
words.
If
only
he
could
see
the
boy
again,
sit
and
talk
with
him…
pain
shot
through
his
broken
leg,
beneath
the
filthy
grey
plaster
of
his
cast.
He
winced,
his
fingers
opening
and
closing
helplessly.
“Is
this
your
own
scheme,”
he
gasped
out
at
Varys,
“or
are
you
in
league
with
Littlefinger?”

That
seemed
to
amuse
the
eunuch.
“I
would
sooner
wed
the
Black
Goat
of
Qohor.
Littlefinger
is
the
second
most
devious
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Oh,
I
feed
him
choice
whispers,
sufficient
so
that
he
thinks
I
am
his…
just
as
I
allow
Cersei
to
believe
I
am
hers.”

“And
just
as
you
let
me
believe
that
you
were
mine.
Tell
me,
Lord
Varys,
who
do
you
truly
serve?”

Varys
smiled
thinly.
“Why,
the
realm,
my
good
lord,
how
ever
could
you
doubt
that?
I
swear
it
by
my
lost
manhood.
I
serve
the
realm,
and
the
realm
needs
peace.”
He
finished
the
last
swallow
of
wine,
and
tossed
the
empty
skin
aside.
“So
what
is
your
answer,
Lord
Eddard?
Give
me
your
word
that
you’ll
tell
the
queen
what
she
wants
to
hear
when
she
comes
calling.”

“If
I
did,
my
word
would
be
as
hollow
as
an
empty
suit
of
armor.
My
life
is
not
so
precious
to
me
as
that.”

“Pity.”
The
eunuch
stood.
“And
your
daughter’s
life,
my
lord?
How
precious
is
that?”

A
chill
pierced
Ned’s
heart.
“My
daughter…”

“Surely
you
did
not
think
I’d
forgotten
about
your
sweet
innocent,
my
lord?
The
queen
most
certainly
has
not.”

“No,”
Ned
pleaded,
his
voice
cracking.
“Varys,
gods
have
mercy,
do
as
you
like
with
me,
but
leave
my
daughter
out
of
your
schemes.
Sansa’s
no
more
than
a
child.”

“Rhaenys
was
a
child
too.
Prince
Rhaegar’s
daughter.
A
precious
little
thing,
younger
than
your
girls.
She
had
a
small
black
kitten
she
called
Balerion,
did
you
know?
I
always
wondered
what
happened
to
him.
Rhaenys
liked
to
pretend
he
was
the
true
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread
of
old,
but
I
imagine
the
Lannisters
taught
her
the
difference
between
a
kitten
and
a
dragon
quick
enough,
the
day
they
broke
down
her
door.”
Varys
gave
a
long
weary
sigh,
the
sigh
of
a
man
who
carried
all
the
sadness
of
the
world
in
a
sack
upon
his
shoulders.
“The
High
Septon
once
told
me
that
as
we
sin,
so
do
we
suffer.
If
that’s
true,
Lord
Eddard,
tell
me…
why
is
it
always
the
innocents
who
suffer
most,
when
you
high
lords
play
your
game
of
thrones?
Ponder
it,
if
you
would,
while
you
wait
upon
the
queen.
And
spare
a
thought
for
this
as
well:
The
next
visitor
who
calls
on
you
could
bring
you
bread
and
cheese
and
the
milk
of
the
poppy
for
your
pain…
or
he
could
bring
you
Sansa’s
head.

“The
choice,
my
dear
lord
Hand,
is
entirely
yours.”





CATELYN

As
the
host
trooped
down
the
causeway
through
the
black
bogs
of
the
Neck
and
spilled
out
into
the
riverlands
beyond,
Catelyn’s
apprehensions
grew.
She
masked
her
fears
behind
a
face
kept
still
and
stern,
yet
they
were
there
all
the
same,
growing
with
every
league
they
crossed.
Her
days
were
anxious,
her
nights
restless,
and
every
raven
that
flew
overhead
made
her
clench
her
teeth.

She
feared
for
her
lord
father,
and
wondered
at
his
ominous
silence.
She
feared
for
her
brother
Edmure,
and
prayed
that
the
gods
would
watch
over
him
if
he
must
face
the
Kingslayer
in
battle.
She
feared
for
Ned
and
her
girls,
and
for
the
sweet
sons
she
had
left
behind
at
Winterfell.
And
yet
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
any
of
them,
and
so
she
made
herself
put
all
thought
of
them
aside.
You
must
save
your
strength
for
Robb,
she
told
herself.
He
is
the
only
one
you
can
help.
You
must
be
as
fierce
and
hard
as
the
north,
Catelyn
Tully.
You
must
be
a
Stark
for
true
now,
like
your
son.

Robb
rode
at
the
front
of
the
column,
beneath
the
flapping
white
banner
of
Winterfell.
Each
day
he
would
ask
one
of
his
lords
to
join
him,
so
they
might
confer
as
they
marched;
he
honored
every
man
in
turn,
showing
no
favorites,
listening
as
his
lord
father
had
listened,
weighing
the
words
of
one
against
the
other.
He
has
learned
so
much
from
Ned,
she
thought
as
she
watched
him,
but
has
he
learned
enough?

The
Blackfish
had
taken
a
hundred
picked
men
and
a
hundred
swift
horses
and
raced
ahead
to
screen
their
movements
and
scout
the
way.
The
reports
Ser
Brynden’s
riders
brought
back
did
little
to
reassure
her.
Lord
Tywin’s
host
was
still
many
days
to
the
south…
but
Walder
Frey,
Lord
of
the
Crossing,
had
assembled
a
force
of
near
four
thousand
men
at
his
castles
on
the
Green
Fork.

“Late
again,”
Catelyn
murmured
when
she
heard.
It
was
the
Trident
all
over,
damn
the
man.
Her
brother
Edmure
had
called
the
banners;
by
rights,
Lord
Frey
should
have
gone
to
join
the
Tully
host
at
Riverrun,
yet
here
he
sat.

“Four
thousand
men,”
Robb
repeated,
more
perplexed
than
angry.
“Lord
Frey
cannot
hope
to
fight
the
Lannisters
by
himself.
Surely
he
means
to
join
his
power
to
ours.”

“Does
he?”
Catelyn
asked.
She
had
ridden
forward
to
join
Robb
and
Robett
Glover,
his
companion
of
the
day.
The
vanguard
spread
out
behind
them,
a
slow-moving
forest
of
lances
and
banners
and
spears.
“I
wonder.
Expect
nothing
of
Walder
Frey,
and
you
will
never
be
surprised.”

“He’s
your
father’s
bannerman.”

“Some
men
take
their
oaths
more
seriously
than
others,
Robb.
And
Lord
Walder
was
always
friendlier
with
Casterly
Rock
than
my
father
would
have
liked.
One
of
his
sons
is
wed
to
Tywin
Lannister’s
sister.
That
means
little
of
itself,
to
be
sure.
Lord
Walder
has
sired
a
great
many
children
over
the
years,
and
they
must
needs
marry
someone.
Still…”

“Do
you
think
he
means
to
betray
us
to
the
Lannisters,
my
lady?”
Robett
Glover
asked
gravely.

Catelyn
sighed.
“If
truth
be
told,
I
doubt
even
Lord
Frey
knows
what
Lord
Frey
intends
to
do.
He
has
an
old
man’s
caution
and
a
young
man’s
ambition,
and
has
never
lacked
for
cunning.”

“We
must
have
the
Twins,
Mother,”
Robb
said
heatedly.
“There
is
no
other
way
across
the
river.
You
know
that.”

“Yes.
And
so
does
Walder
Frey,
you
can
be
sure
of
that.”

That
night
they
made
camp
on
the
southern
edge
of
the
bogs,
halfway
between
the
kingsroad
and
the
river.
It
was
there
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
them
further
word
from
her
uncle.
“Ser
Brynden
says
to
tell
you
he’s
crossed
swords
with
the
Lannisters.
There
are
a
dozen
scouts
who
won’t
be
reporting
back
to
Lord
Tywin
anytime
soon.
Or
ever.”
He
grinned.
“Ser
Addam
Marbrand
commands
their
outriders,
and
he’s
pulling
back
south,
burning
as
he
goes.
He
knows
where
we
are,
more
or
less,
but
the
Blackfish
vows
he
will
not
know
when
we
split.”

“Unless
Lord
Frey
tells
him,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“Theon,
when
you
return
to
my
uncle,
tell
him
he
is
to
place
his
best
bowmen
around
the
Twins,
day
and
night,
with
orders
to
bring
down
any
raven
they
see
leaving
the
battlements.
I
want
no
birds
bringing
word
of
my
son’s
movements
to
Lord
Tywin.”

“Ser
Brynden
has
seen
to
it
already,
my
lady,”
Theon
replied
with
a
cocky
smile.
“A
few
more
blackbirds,
and
we
should
have
enough
to
bake
a
pie.
I’ll
save
you
their
feathers
for
a
hat.”

She
ought
to
have
known
that
Brynden
Blackfish
would
be
well
ahead
of
her.
“What
have
the
Freys
been
doing
while
the
Lannisters
burn
their
fields
and
plunder
their
holdfasts?”

“There’s
been
some
fighting
between
Ser
Addam’s
men
and
Lord
Walder’s,”
Theon
answered.
“Not
a
day’s
ride
from
here,
we
found
two
Lannister
scouts
feeding
the
crows
where
the
Freys
had
strung
them
up.
Most
of
Lord
Walder’s
strength
remains
massed
at
the
Twins,
though.”

That
bore
Walder
Frey’s
seal
beyond
a
doubt,
Catelyn
thought
bitterly;
hold
back,
wait,
watch,
take
no
risk
unless
forced
to
it.

“If
he’s
been
fighting
the
Lannisters,
perhaps
he
does
mean
to
hold
to
his
vows,”
Robb
said.

Catelyn
was
less
encouraged.
“Defending
his
own
lands
is
one
thing,
open
battle
against
Lord
Tywin
quite
another.”

Robb
turned
back
to
Theon
Greyjoy.
“Has
the
Blackfish
found
any
other
way
across
the
Green
Fork?”

Theon
shook
his
head.
“The
river’s
running
high
and
fast.
Ser
Brynden
says
it
can’t
be
forded,
not
this
far
north.”

“I
must
have
that
crossing!”
Robb
declared,
fuming.
“Oh,
our
horses
might
be
able
to
swim
the
river,
I
suppose,
but
not
with
armored
men
on
their
backs.
We’d
need
to
build
rafts
to
pole
our
steel
across,
helms
and
mail
and
lances,
and
we
don’t
have
the
trees
for
that.
Or
the
time.
Lord
Tywin
is
marching
north…”
He
balled
his
hand
into
a
fist.

“Lord
Frey
would
be
a
fool
to
try
and
bar
our
way,”
Theon
Greyjoy
said
with
his
customary
easy
confidence.
“We
have
five
times
his
numbers.
You
can
take
the
Twins
if
you
need
to,
Robb.”

“Not
easily,”
Catelyn
warned
them,
“and
not
in
time.
While
you
were
mounting
your
siege,
Tywin
Lannister
would
bring
up
his
host
and
assault
you
from
the
rear.”

Robb
glanced
from
her
to
Greyjoy,
searching
for
an
answer
and
finding
none.
For
a
moment
he
looked
even
younger
than
his
fifteen
years,
despite
his
mail
and
sword
and
the
stubble
on
his
cheeks.
“What
would
my
lord
father
do?”
he
asked
her.

“Find
a
way
across,”
she
told
him.
“Whatever
it
took.”

The
next
morning
it
was
Ser
Brynden
Tully
himself
who
rode
back
to
them.
He
had
put
aside
the
heavy
plate
and
helm
he’d
worn
as
the
Knight
of
the
Gate
for
the
lighter
leather-and-mail
of
an
outrider,
but
his
obsidian
fish
still
fastened
his
cloak.

Her
uncle’s
face
was
grave
as
he
swung
down
off
his
horse.
“There
has
been
a
battle
under
the
walls
of
Riverrun,”
he
said,
his
mouth
grim.
“We
had
it
from
a
Lannister
outrider
we
took
captive.
The
Kingslayer
has
destroyed
Edmure’s
host
and
sent
the
lords
of
the
Trident
reeling
in
flight.”

A
cold
hand
clutched
at
Catelyn’s
heart.
“And
my
brother?”

“Wounded
and
taken
prisoner,”
Ser
Brynden
said.
“Lord
Blackwood
and
the
other
survivors
are
under
siege
inside
Riverrun,
surrounded
by
Jaime’s
host.”

Robb
looked
fretful.
“We
must
get
across
this
accursed
river
if
we’re
to
have
any
hope
of
relieving
them
in
time.”

“That
will
not
be
easily
done,”
her
uncle
cautioned.
“Lord
Frey
has
pulled
his
whole
strength
back
inside
his
castles,
and
his
gates
are
closed
and
barred.”

“Damn
the
man,”
Robb
swore.
“If
the
old
fool
does
not
relent
and
let
me
cross,
he’ll
leave
me
no
choice
but
to
storm
his
walls.
I’ll
pull
the
Twins
down
around
his
ears
if
I
have
to,
we’ll
see
how
well
he
likes
that!”

“You
sound
like
a
sulky
boy,
Robb,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“A
child
sees
an
obstacle,
and
his
first
thought
is
to
run
around
it
or
knock
it
down.
A
lord
must
learn
that
sometimes
words
can
accomplish
what
swords
cannot.”

Robb’s
neck
reddened
at
the
rebuke.
“Tell
me
what
you
mean,
Mother,”
he
said
meekly.

“The
Freys
have
held
the
crossing
for
six
hundred
years,
and
for
six
hundred
years
they
have
never
failed
to
exact
their
toll.”

“What
toll?
What
does
he
want?”

She
smiled.
“That
is
what
we
must
discover.”

“And
what
if
I
do
not
choose
to
pay
this
toll?”

“Then
you
had
best
retreat
back
to
Moat
Cailin,
deploy
to
meet
Lord
Tywin
in
battle…
or
grow
wings.
I
see
no
other
choices.”
Catelyn
put
her
heels
to
her
horse
and
rode
off,
leaving
her
son
to
ponder
her
words.
It
would
not
do
to
make
him
feel
as
if
his
mother
were
usurping
his
place.
Did
you
teach
him
wisdom
as
well
as
valor,
Ned?
she
wondered.
Did
you
teach
him
how
to
kneel?
The
graveyards
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
full
of
brave
men
who
had
never
learned
that
lesson.

It
was
near
midday
when
their
vanguard
came
in
sight
of
the
Twins,
where
the
Lords
of
the
Crossing
had
their
seat.

The
Green
Fork
ran
swift
and
deep
here,
but
the
Freys
had
spanned
it
many
centuries
past
and
grown
rich
off
the
coin
men
paid
them
to
cross.
Their
bridge
was
a
massive
arch
of
smooth
grey
rock,
wide
enough
for
two
wagons
to
pass
abreast;
the
Water
Tower
rose
from
the
center
of
the
span,
commanding
both
road
and
river
with
its
arrow
slits,
murder
holes,
and
portcullises.
It
had
taken
the
Freys
three
generations
to
complete
their
bridge;
when
they
were
done
they’d
thrown
up
stout
timber
keeps
on
either
bank,
so
no
one
might
cross
without
their
leave.

The
timber
had
long
since
given
way
to
stone.
The
Twins—two
squat,
ugly,
formidable
castles,
identical
in
every
respect,
with
the
bridge
arching
between—had
guarded
the
crossing
for
centuries.
High
curtain
walls,
deep
moats,
and
heavy
oak-and-iron
gates
protected
the
approaches,
the
bridge
footings
rose
from
within
stout
inner
keeps,
there
was
a
barbican
and
portcullis
on
either
bank,
and
the
Water
Tower
defended
the
span
itself.

One
glance
was
sufficient
to
tell
Catelyn
that
the
castle
would
not
be
taken
by
storm.
The
battlements
bristled
with
spears
and
swords
and
scorpions,
there
was
an
archer
at
every
crenel
and
arrow
slit,
the
drawbridge
was
up,
the
portcullis
down,
the
gates
closed
and
barred.

The
Greatjon
began
to
curse
and
swear
as
soon
as
he
saw
what
awaited
them.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
glowered
in
silence.
“That
cannot
be
assaulted,
my
lords,”
Roose
Bolton
announced.

“Nor
can
we
take
it
by
siege,
without
an
army
on
the
far
bank
to
invest
the
other
castle,”
Helman
Tallhart
said
gloomily.
Across
the
deep-running
green
waters,
the
western
twin
stood
like
a
reflection
of
its
eastern
brother.
“Even
if
we
had
the
time.
Which,
to
be
sure,
we
do
not.”

As
the
northern
lords
studied
the
castle,
a
sally
port
opened,
a
plank
bridge
slid
across
the
moat,
and
a
dozen
knights
rode
forth
to
confront
them,
led
by
four
of
Lord
Walder’s
many
sons.
Their
banner
bore
twin
towers,
dark
blue
on
a
field
of
pale
silver-grey.
Ser
Stevron
Frey,
Lord
Walder’s
heir,
spoke
for
them.
The
Freys
all
looked
like
weasels;
Ser
Stevron,
past
sixty
with
grandchildren
of
his
own,
looked
like
an
especially
old
and
tired
weasel,
yet
he
was
polite
enough.
“My
lord
father
has
sent
me
to
greet
you,
and
inquire
as
to
who
leads
this
mighty
host.”

“I
do.”
Robb
spurred
his
horse
forward.
He
was
in
his
armor,
with
the
direwolf
shield
of
Winterfell
strapped
to
his
saddle
and
Grey
Wind
padding
by
his
side.

The
old
knight
looked
at
her
son
with
a
faint
flicker
of
amusement
in
his
watery
grey
eyes,
though
his
gelding
whickered
uneasily
and
sidled
away
from
the
direwolf.
“My
lord
father
would
be
most
honored
if
you
would
share
meat
and
mead
with
him
in
the
castle
and
explain
your
purpose
here.”

His
words
crashed
among
the
lords
bannermen
like
a
great
stone
from
a
catapult.
Not
one
of
them
approved.
They
cursed,
argued,
shouted
down
each
other.

“You
must
not
do
this,
my
lord,”
Galbart
Glover
pleaded
with
Robb.
“Lord
Walder
is
not
to
be
trusted.”

Roose
Bolton
nodded.
“Go
in
there
alone
and
you’re
his.
He
can
sell
you
to
the
Lannisters,
throw
you
in
a
dungeon,
or
slit
your
throat,
as
he
likes.”

“If
he
wants
to
talk
to
us,
let
him
open
his
gates,
and
we
will
all
share
his
meat
and
mead,”
declared
Ser
Wendel
Manderly.

“Or
let
him
come
out
and
treat
with
Robb
here,
in
plain
sight
of
his
men
and
ours,”
suggested
his
brother,
Ser
Wylis.

Catelyn
Stark
shared
all
their
doubts,
but
she
had
only
to
glance
at
Ser
Stevron
to
see
that
he
was
not
pleased
by
what
he
was
hearing.
A
few
more
words
and
the
chance
would
be
lost.
She
had
to
act,
and
quickly.
“I
will
go,”
she
said
loudly.

“You,
my
lady?”
The
Greatjon
furrowed
his
brow.

“Mother,
are
you
certain?”
Clearly,
Robb
was
not.

“Never
more,”
Catelyn
lied
glibly.
“Lord
Walder
is
my
father’s
bannerman.
I
have
known
him
since
I
was
a
girl.
He
would
never
offer
me
any
harm.”
Unless
he
saw
some
profit
in
it,
she
added
silently,
but
some
truths
did
not
bear
saying,
and
some
lies
were
necessary.

“I
am
certain
my
lord
father
would
be
pleased
to
speak
to
the
Lady
Catelyn,”
Ser
Stevron
said.
“To
vouchsafe
for
our
good
intentions,
my
brother
Ser
Perwyn
will
remain
here
until
she
is
safely
returned
to
you.”

“He
shall
be
our
honored
guest,”
said
Robb.
Ser
Perwyn,
the
youngest
of
the
four
Freys
in
the
party,
dismounted
and
handed
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
a
brother.
“I
require
my
lady
mother’s
return
by
evenfall,
Ser
Stevron,”
Robb
went
on.
“It
is
not
my
intent
to
linger
here
long.”

Ser
Stevron
Frey
gave
a
polite
nod.
“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Catelyn
spurred
her
horse
forward
and
did
not
look
back.
Lord
Walder’s
sons
and
envoys
fell
in
around
her.

Her
father
had
once
said
of
Walder
Frey
that
he
was
the
only
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
could
field
an
army
out
of
his
breeches.
When
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing
welcomed
Catelyn
in
the
great
hall
of
the
east
castle,
surrounded
by
twenty
living
sons
(minus
Ser
Perwyn,
who
would
have
made
twenty-one),
thirty-six
grandsons,
nineteen
great-grandsons,
and
numerous
daughters,
granddaughters,
bastards,
and
grandbastards,
she
understood
just
what
he
had
meant.

Lord
Walder
was
ninety,
a
wizened
pink
weasel
with
a
bald
spotted
head,
too
gouty
to
stand
unassisted.
His
newest
wife,
a
pale
frail
girl
of
sixteen
years,
walked
beside
his
litter
when
they
carried
him
in.
She
was
the
eighth
Lady
Frey.

“It
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
again
after
so
many
years,
my
lord,”
Catelyn
said.

The
old
man
squinted
at
her
suspiciously.
“Is
it?
I
doubt
that.
Spare
me
your
sweet
words,
Lady
Catelyn,
I
am
too
old.
Why
are
you
here?
Is
your
boy
too
proud
to
come
before
me
himself?
What
am
I
to
do
with
you?”

Catelyn
had
been
a
girl
the
last
time
she
had
visited
the
Twins,
but
even
then
Lord
Walder
had
been
irascible,
sharp
of
tongue,
and
blunt
of
manner.
Age
had
made
him
worse
than
ever,
it
would
seem.
She
would
need
to
choose
her
words
with
care,
and
do
her
best
to
take
no
offense
from
his.

“Father,”
Ser
Stevron
said
reproachfully,
“you
forget
yourself.
Lady
Stark
is
here
at
your
invitation.”

“Did
I
ask
you?
You
are
not
Lord
Frey
yet,
not
until
I
die.
Do
I
look
dead?
I’ll
hear
no
instructions
from
you.”

“This
is
no
way
to
speak
in
front
of
our
noble
guest,
Father,”
one
of
his
younger
sons
said.

“Now
my
bastards
presume
to
teach
me
courtesy,”
Lord
Walder
complained.
“I’ll
speak
any
way
I
like,
damn
you.
I’ve
had
three
kings
to
guest
in
my
life,
and
queens
as
well,
do
you
think
I
require
lessons
from
the
likes
of
you,
Ryger?
Your
mother
was
milking
goats
the
first
time
I
gave
her
my
seed.”
He
dismissed
the
red-faced
youth
with
a
flick
of
his
fingers
and
gestured
to
two
of
his
other
sons.
“Danwell,
Whalen,
help
me
to
my
chair.”

They
shifted
Lord
Walder
from
his
litter
and
carried
him
to
the
high
seat
of
the
Freys,
a
tall
chair
of
black
oak
whose
back
was
carved
in
the
shape
of
two
towers
linked
by
a
bridge.
His
young
wife
crept
up
timidly
and
covered
his
legs
with
a
blanket.
When
he
was
settled,
the
old
man
beckoned
Catelyn
forward
and
planted
a
papery
dry
kiss
on
her
hand.
“There,”
he
announced.
“Now
that
I
have
observed
the
courtesies,
my
lady,
perhaps
my
sons
will
do
me
the
honor
of
shutting
their
mouths.
Why
are
you
here?”

“To
ask
you
to
open
your
gates,
my
lord,”
Catelyn
replied
politely.
“My
son
and
his
lords
bannermen
are
most
anxious
to
cross
the
river
and
be
on
their
way.”

“To
Riverrun?”
He
sniggered.
“Oh,
no
need
to
tell
me,
no
need.
I’m
not
blind
yet.
The
old
man
can
still
read
a
map.”

“To
Riverrun,”
Catelyn
confirmed.
She
saw
no
reason
to
deny
it.
“Where
I
might
have
expected
to
find
you,
my
lord.
You
are
still
my
father’s
bannerman,
are
you
not?”

“Heh,”
said
Lord
Walder,
a
noise
halfway
between
a
laugh
and
a
grunt.
“I
called
my
swords,
yes
I
did,
here
they
are,
you
saw
them
on
the
walls.
It
was
my
intent
to
march
as
soon
as
all
my
strength
was
assembled.
Well,
to
send
my
sons.
I
am
well
past
marching
myself,
Lady
Catelyn.”
He
looked
around
for
likely
confirmation
and
pointed
to
a
tall,
stooped
man
of
fifty
years.
“Tell
her,
Jared.
Tell
her
that
was
my
intent.”

“It
was,
my
lady,”
said
Ser
Jared
Frey,
one
of
his
sons
by
his
second
wife.
“On
my
honor.”

“Is
it
my
fault
that
your
fool
brother
lost
his
battle
before
we
could
march?”
He
leaned
back
against
his
cushions
and
scowled
at
her,
as
if
challenging
her
to
dispute
his
version
of
events.
“I
am
told
the
Kingslayer
went
through
him
like
an
axe
through
ripe
cheese.
Why
should
my
boys
hurry
south
to
die?
All
those
who
did
go
south
are
running
north
again.”

Catelyn
would
gladly
have
spitted
the
querulous
old
man
and
roasted
him
over
a
fire,
but
she
had
only
till
evenfall
to
open
the
bridge.
Calmly,
she
said,
“All
the
more
reason
that
we
must
reach
Riverrun,
and
soon.
Where
can
we
go
to
talk,
my
lord?”

“We’re
talking
now,”
Lord
Frey
complained.
The
spotted
pink
head
snapped
around.
“What
are
you
all
looking
at?”
he
shouted
at
his
kin.
“Get
out
of
here.
Lady
Stark
wants
to
speak
to
me
in
private.
Might
be
she
has
designs
on
my
fidelity,
heh.
Go,
all
of
you,
find
something
useful
to
do.
Yes,
you
too,
woman.
Out,
out,
out.”
As
his
sons
and
grandsons
and
daughters
and
bastards
and
nieces
and
nephews
streamed
from
the
hall,
he
leaned
close
to
Catelyn
and
confessed,
“They’re
all
waiting
for
me
to
die.
Stevron’s
been
waiting
for
forty
years,
but
I
keep
disappointing
him.
Heh.
Why
should
I
die
just
so
he
can
be
a
lord?
I
ask
you.
I
won’t
do
it.”

“I
have
every
hope
that
you
will
live
to
be
a
hundred.”

“That
would
boil
them,
to
be
sure.
Oh,
to
be
sure.
Now,
what
do
you
want
to
say?”

“We
want
to
cross,”
Catelyn
told
him.

“Oh,
do
you?
That’s
blunt.
Why
should
I
let
you?”

For
a
moment
her
anger
flared.
“If
you
were
strong
enough
to
climb
your
own
battlements,
Lord
Frey,
you
would
see
that
my
son
has
twenty
thousand
men
outside
your
walls.”

“They’ll
be
twenty
thousand
fresh
corpses
when
Lord
Tywin
gets
here,”
the
old
man
shot
back.
“Don’t
you
try
and
frighten
me,
my
lady.
Your
husband’s
in
some
traitor’s
cell
under
the
Red
Keep,
your
father’s
sick,
might
be
dying,
and
Jaime
Lannister’s
got
your
brother
in
chains.
What
do
you
have
that
I
should
fear?
That
son
of
yours?
I’ll
match
you
son
for
son,
and
I’ll
still
have
eighteen
when
yours
are
all
dead.”

“You
swore
an
oath
to
my
father,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

He
bobbed
his
head
side
to
side,
smiling.
“Oh,
yes,
I
said
some
words,
but
I
swore
oaths
to
the
crown
too,
it
seems
to
me.
Joffrey’s
the
king
now,
and
that
makes
you
and
your
boy
and
all
those
fools
out
there
no
better
than
rebels.
If
I
had
the
sense
the
gods
gave
a
fish,
I’d
help
the
Lannisters
boil
you
all.”

“Why
don’t
you?”
she
challenged
him.

Lord
Walder
snorted
with
disdain.
“Lord
Tywin
the
proud
and
splendid,
Warden
of
the
West,
Hand
of
the
King,
oh,
what
a
great
man
that
one
is,
him
and
his
gold
this
and
gold
that
and
lions
here
and
lions
there.
I’ll
wager
you,
he
eats
too
many
beans,
he
breaks
wind
just
like
me,
but
you’ll
never
hear
him
admit
it,
oh,
no.
What’s
he
got
to
be
so
puffed
up
about
anyway?
Only
two
sons,
and
one
of
them’s
a
twisted
little
monster.
I’ll
match
him
son
for
son,
and
I’ll
still
have
nineteen
and
a
half
left
when
all
of
his
are
dead!”
He
cackled.
“If
Lord
Tywin
wants
my
help,
he
can
bloody
well
ask
for
it.”

That
was
all
Catelyn
needed
to
hear.
“I
am
asking
for
your
help,
my
lord,”
she
said
humbly.
“And
my
father
and
my
brother
and
my
lord
husband
and
my
sons
are
asking
with
my
voice.”

Lord
Walder
jabbed
a
bony
finger
at
her
face.
“Save
your
sweet
words,
my
lady.
Sweet
words
I
get
from
my
wife.
Did
you
see
her?
Sixteen
she
is,
a
little
flower,
and
her
honey’s
only
for
me.
I
wager
she
gives
me
a
son
by
this
time
next
year.
Perhaps
I’ll
make
him
heir,
wouldn’t
that
boil
the
rest
of
them?”

“I’m
certain
she
will
give
you
many
sons.”

His
head
bobbed
up
and
down.
“Your
lord
father
did
not
come
to
the
wedding.
An
insult,
as
I
see
it.
Even
if
he
is
dying.
He
never
came
to
my
last
wedding
either.
He
calls
me
the
Late
Lord
Frey,
you
know.
Does
he
think
I’m
dead?
I’m
not
dead,
and
I
promise
you,
I’ll
outlive
him
as
I
outlived
his
father.
Your
family
has
always
pissed
on
me,
don’t
deny
it,
don’t
lie,
you
know
it’s
true.
Years
ago,
I
went
to
your
father
and
suggested
a
match
between
his
son
and
my
daughter.
Why
not?
I
had
a
daughter
in
mind,
sweet
girl,
only
a
few
years
older
than
Edmure,
but
if
your
brother
didn’t
warm
to
her,
I
had
others
he
might
have
had,
young
ones,
old
ones,
virgins,
widows,
whatever
he
wanted.
No,
Lord
Hoster
would
not
hear
of
it.
Sweet
words
he
gave
me,
excuses,
but
what
I
wanted
was
to
get
rid
of
a
daughter.

“And
your
sister,
that
one,
she’s
full
as
bad.
It
was,
oh,
a
year
ago,
no
more,
Jon
Arryn
was
still
the
King’s
Hand,
and
I
went
to
the
city
to
see
my
sons
ride
in
the
tourney.
Stevron
and
Jared
are
too
old
for
the
lists
now,
but
Danwell
and
Hosteen
rode,
Perwyn
as
well,
and
a
couple
of
my
bastards
tried
the
melee.
If
I’d
known
how
they’d
shame
me,
I
would
never
have
troubled
myself
to
make
the
journey.
Why
did
I
need
to
ride
all
that
way
to
see
Hosteen
knocked
off
his
horse
by
that
Tyrell
whelp?
I
ask
you.
The
boy’s
half
his
age,
Ser
Daisy
they
call
him,
something
like
that.
And
Danwell
was
unhorsed
by
a
hedge
knight!
Some
days
I
wonder
if
those
two
are
truly
mine.
My
third
wife
was
a
Crakehall,
all
of
the
Crakehall
women
are
sluts.
Well,
never
mind
about
that,
she
died
before
you
were
born,
what
do
you
care?

“I
was
speaking
of
your
sister.
I
proposed
that
Lord
and
Lady
Arryn
foster
two
of
my
grandsons
at
court,
and
offered
to
take
their
own
son
to
ward
here
at
the
Twins.
Are
my
grandsons
unworthy
to
be
seen
at
the
king’s
court?
They
are
sweet
boys,
quiet
and
mannerly.
Walder
is
Merrett’s
son,
named
after
me,
and
the
other
one…
heh,
I
don’t
recall…
he
might
have
been
another
Walder,
they’re
always
naming
them
Walder
so
I’ll
favor
them,
but
his
father…
which
one
was
his
father
now?”
His
face
wrinkled
up.
“Well,
whoever
he
was,
Lord
Arryn
wouldn’t
have
him,
or
the
other
one,
and
I
blame
your
lady
sister
for
that.
She
frosted
up
as
if
I’d
suggested
selling
her
boy
to
a
mummer’s
show
or
making
a
eunuch
out
of
him,
and
when
Lord
Arryn
said
the
child
was
going
to
Dragonstone
to
foster
with
Stannis
Baratheon,
she
stormed
off
without
a
word
of
regrets
and
all
the
Hand
could
give
me
was
apologies.
What
good
are
apologies?
I
ask
you.”

Catelyn
frowned,
disquieted.
“I
had
understood
that
Lysa’s
boy
was
to
be
fostered
with
Lord
Tywin
at
Casterly
Rock.”

“No,
it
was
Lord
Stannis,”
Walder
Frey
said
irritably.
“Do
you
think
I
can’t
tell
Lord
Stannis
from
Lord
Tywin?
They’re
both
bungholes
who
think
they’re
too
noble
to
shit,
but
never
mind
about
that,
I
know
the
difference.
Or
do
you
think
I’m
so
old
I
can’t
remember?
I’m
ninety
and
I
remember
very
well.
I
remember
what
to
do
with
a
woman
too.
That
wife
of
mine
will
give
me
a
son
before
this
time
next
year,
I’ll
wager.
Or
a
daughter,
that
can’t
be
helped.
Boy
or
girl,
it
will
be
red,
wrinkled,
and
squalling,
and
like
as
not
she’ll
want
to
name
it
Walder
or
Walda.”

Catelyn
was
not
concerned
with
what
Lady
Frey
might
choose
to
name
her
child.
“Jon
Arryn
was
going
to
foster
his
son
with
Lord
Stannis,
you
are
quite
certain
of
that?”

“Yes,
yes,
yes,”
the
old
man
said.
“Only
he
died,
so
what
does
it
matter?
You
say
you
want
to
cross
the
river?”

“We
do.”

“Well,
you
can’t!”
Lord
Walder
announced
crisply.
“Not
unless
I
allow
it,
and
why
should
I?
The
Tullys
and
the
Starks
have
never
been
friends
of
mine.”
He
pushed
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
arms,
smirking,
waiting
for
her
answer.

The
rest
was
only
haggling.

A
swollen
red
sun
hung
low
against
the
western
hills
when
the
gates
of
the
castle
opened.
The
drawbridge
creaked
down,
the
portcullis
winched
up,
and
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
rode
forth
to
rejoin
her
son
and
his
lords
bannermen.
Behind
her
came
Ser
Jared
Frey,
Ser
Hosteen
Frey,
Ser
Danwell
Frey,
and
Lord
Walder’s
bastard
son
Ronel
Rivers,
leading
a
long
column
of
pikemen,
rank
on
rank
of
shuffling
men
in
blue
steel
ringmail
and
silvery
grey
cloaks.

Robb
galloped
out
to
meet
her,
with
Grey
Wind
racing
beside
his
stallion.
“It’s
done,”
she
told
him.
“Lord
Walder
will
grant
you
your
crossing.
His
swords
are
yours
as
well,
less
four
hundred
he
means
to
keep
back
to
hold
the
Twins.
I
suggest
that
you
leave
four
hundred
of
your
own,
a
mixed
force
of
archers
and
swordsmen.
He
can
scarcely
object
to
an
offer
to
augment
his
garrison…
but
make
certain
you
give
the
command
to
a
man
you
can
trust.
Lord
Walder
may
need
help
keeping
faith.”

“As
you
say,
Mother,”
Robb
answered,
gazing
at
the
ranks
of
pikemen.
“Perhaps…
Ser
Helman
Tallhart,
do
you
think?”

“A
fine
choice.”

“What…
what
did
he
want
of
us?”

“If
you
can
spare
a
few
of
your
swords,
I
need
some
men
to
escort
two
of
Lord
Frey’s
grandsons
north
to
Winterfell,”
she
told
him.
“I
have
agreed
to
take
them
as
wards.
They
are
young
boys,
aged
eight
years
and
seven.
It
would
seem
they
are
both
named
Walder.
Your
brother
Bran
will
welcome
the
companionship
of
lads
near
his
own
age,
I
should
think.”

“Is
that
all?
Two
fosterlings?
That’s
a
small
enough
price
to—”

“Lord
Frey’s
son
Olyvar
will
be
coming
with
us,”
she
went
on.
“He
is
to
serve
as
your
personal
squire.
His
father
would
like
to
see
him
knighted,
in
good
time.”

“A
squire.”
He
shrugged.
“Fine,
that’s
fine,
if
he’s—”

“Also,
if
your
sister
Arya
is
returned
to
us
safely,
it
is
agreed
that
she
will
marry
Lord
Walder’s
youngest
son,
Elmar,
when
the
two
of
them
come
of
age.”

Robb
looked
nonplussed.
“Arya
won’t
like
that
one
bit.”

“And
you
are
to
wed
one
of
his
daughters,
once
the
fighting
is
done,”
she
finished.
“His
lordship
has
graciously
consented
to
allow
you
to
choose
whichever
girl
you
prefer.
He
has
a
number
he
thinks
might
be
suitable.”

To
his
credit,
Robb
did
not
flinch.
“I
see.”

“Do
you
consent?”

“Can
I
refuse?”

“Not
if
you
wish
to
cross.”

“I
consent,”
Robb
said
solemnly.
He
had
never
seemed
more
manly
to
her
than
he
did
in
that
moment.
Boys
might
play
with
swords,
but
it
took
a
lord
to
make
a
marriage
pact,
knowing
what
it
meant.

They
crossed
at
evenfall
as
a
horned
moon
floated
upon
the
river.
The
double
column
wound
its
way
through
the
gate
of
the
eastern
twin
like
a
great
steel
snake,
slithering
across
the
courtyard,
into
the
keep
and
over
the
bridge,
to
issue
forth
once
more
from
the
second
castle
on
the
west
bank.

Catelyn
rode
at
the
head
of
the
serpent,
with
her
son
and
her
uncle
Ser
Brynden
and
Ser
Stevron
Frey.
Behind
followed
nine
tenths
of
their
horse;
knights,
lancers,
freeriders,
and
mounted
bowmen.
It
took
hours
for
them
all
to
cross.
Afterward,
Catelyn
would
remember
the
clatter
of
countless
hooves
on
the
drawbridge,
the
sight
of
Lord
Walder
Frey
in
his
litter
watching
them
pass,
the
glitter
of
eyes
peering
down
through
the
slats
of
the
murder
holes
in
the
ceiling
as
they
rode
through
the
Water
Tower.

The
larger
part
of
the
northern
host,
pikes
and
archers
and
great
masses
of
men-at-arms
on
foot,
remained
upon
the
east
bank
under
the
command
of
Roose
Bolton.
Robb
had
commanded
him
to
continue
the
march
south,
to
confront
the
huge
Lannister
army
coming
north
under
Lord
Tywin.

For
good
or
ill,
her
son
had
thrown
the
dice.





JON

“Are
you
well,
Snow?”
Lord
Mormont
asked,
scowling.

“Well,”
his
raven
squawked.
“Well.”

“I
am,
my
lord,”
Jon
lied…
loudly,
as
if
that
could
make
it
true.
“And
you?”

Mormont
frowned.
“A
dead
man
tried
to
kill
me.
How
well
could
I
be?”
He
scratched
under
his
chin.
His
shaggy
grey
beard
had
been
singed
in
the
fire,
and
he’d
hacked
it
off.
The
pale
stubble
of
his
new
whiskers
made
him
look
old,
disreputable,
and
grumpy.
“You
do
not
look
well.
How
is
your
hand?”

“Healing.”
Jon
flexed
his
bandaged
fingers
to
show
him.
He
had
burned
himself
more
badly
than
he
knew
throwing
the
flaming
drapes,
and
his
right
hand
was
swathed
in
silk
halfway
to
the
elbow.
At
the
time
he’d
felt
nothing;
the
agony
had
come
after.
His
cracked
red
skin
oozed
fluid,
and
fearsome
blood
blisters
rose
between
his
fingers,
big
as
roaches.
“The
maester
says
I’ll
have
scars,
but
otherwise
the
hand
should
be
as
good
as
it
was
before.”

“A
scarred
hand
is
nothing.
On
the
Wall,
you’ll
be
wearing
gloves
often
as
not.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
It
was
not
the
thought
of
scars
that
troubled
Jon;
it
was
the
rest
of
it.
Maester
Aemon
had
given
him
milk
of
the
poppy,
yet
even
so,
the
pain
had
been
hideous.
At
first
it
had
felt
as
if
his
hand
were
still
aflame,
burning
day
and
night.
Only
plunging
it
into
basins
of
snow
and
shaved
ice
gave
any
relief
at
all.
Jon
thanked
the
gods
that
no
one
but
Ghost
saw
him
writhing
on
his
bed,
whimpering
from
the
pain.
And
when
at
last
he
did
sleep,
he
dreamt,
and
that
was
even
worse.
In
the
dream,
the
corpse
he
fought
had
blue
eyes,
black
hands,
and
his
father’s
face,
but
he
dared
not
tell
Mormont
that.

“Dywen
and
Hake
returned
last
night,”
the
Old
Bear
said.
“They
found
no
sign
of
your
uncle,
no
more
than
the
others
did.”

“I
know.”
Jon
had
dragged
himself
to
the
common
hall
to
sup
with
his
friends,
and
the
failure
of
the
rangers’
search
had
been
all
the
men
had
been
talking
of.

“You
know,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“How
is
it
that
everyone
knows
everything
around
here?”
He
did
not
seem
to
expect
an
answer.
“It
would
seem
there
were
only
the
two
of…
of
those
creatures,
whatever
they
were,
I
will
not
call
them
men.
And
thank
the
gods
for
that.
Any
more
and…
well,
that
doesn’t
bear
thinking
of.
There
will
be
more,
though.
I
can
feel
it
in
these
old
bones
of
mine,
and
Maester
Aemon
agrees.
The
cold
winds
are
rising.
Summer
is
at
an
end,
and
a
winter
is
coming
such
as
this
world
has
never
seen.”

Winter
is
coming.
The
Stark
words
had
never
sounded
so
grim
or
ominous
to
Jon
as
they
did
now.
“My
lord,”
he
asked
hesitantly,
“it’s
said
there
was
a
bird
last
night…”

“There
was.
What
of
it?”

“I
had
hoped
for
some
word
of
my
father.”

“Father,”
taunted
the
old
raven,
bobbing
its
head
as
it
walked
across
Mormont’s
shoulders.
“Father.”

The
Lord
Commander
reached
up
to
pinch
its
beak
shut,
but
the
raven
hopped
up
on
his
head,
fluttered
its
wings,
and
flew
across
the
chamber
to
light
above
a
window.
“Grief
and
noise,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“That’s
all
they’re
good
for,
ravens.
Why
I
put
up
with
that
pestilential
bird…
if
there
was
news
of
Lord
Eddard,
don’t
you
think
I
would
have
sent
for
you?
Bastard
or
no,
you’re
still
his
blood.
The
message
concerned
Ser
Barristan
Selmy.
It
seems
he’s
been
removed
from
the
Kingsguard.
They
gave
his
place
to
that
black
dog
Clegane,
and
now
Selmy’s
wanted
for
treason.
The
fools
sent
some
watchmen
to
seize
him,
but
he
slew
two
of
them
and
escaped.”
Mormont
snorted,
leaving
no
doubt
of
his
view
of
men
who’d
send
gold
cloaks
against
a
knight
as
renowed
as
Barristan
the
Bold.
“We
have
white
shadows
in
the
woods
and
unquiet
dead
stalking
our
halls,
and
a
boy
sits
the
Iron
Throne,”
he
said
in
disgust.

The
raven
laughed
shrilly.
“Boy,
boy,
boy,
boy.”

Ser
Barristan
had
been
the
Old
Bear’s
best
hope,
Jon
remembered;
if
he
had
fallen,
what
chance
was
there
that
Mormont’s
letter
would
be
heeded?
He
curled
his
hand
into
a
fist.
Pain
shot
through
his
burned
fingers.
“What
of
my
sisters?”

“The
message
made
no
mention
of
Lord
Eddard
or
the
girls.”
He
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
“Perhaps
they
never
got
my
letter.
Aemon
sent
two
copies,
with
his
best
birds,
but
who
can
say?
More
like,
Pycelle
did
not
deign
to
reply.
It
would
not
be
the
first
time,
nor
the
last.
I
fear
we
count
for
less
than
nothing
in
King’s
Landing.
They
tell
us
what
they
want
us
to
know,
and
that’s
little
enough.”

And
you
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
know,
and
that’s
less,
Jon
thought
resentfully.
His
brother
Robb
had
called
the
banners
and
ridden
south
to
war,
yet
no
word
of
that
had
been
breathed
to
him…
save
by
Samwell
Tarly,
who’d
read
the
letter
to
Maester
Aemon
and
whispered
its
contents
to
Jon
that
night
in
secret,
all
the
time
saying
how
he
shouldn’t.
Doubtless
they
thought
his
brother’s
war
was
none
of
his
concern.
It
troubled
him
more
than
he
could
say.
Robb
was
marching
and
he
was
not.
No
matter
how
often
Jon
told
himself
that
his
place
was
here
now,
with
his
new
brothers
on
the
Wall,
he
still
felt
craven.

“Corn,”
the
raven
was
crying.
“Corn,
corn.”

“Oh,
be
quiet,”
the
Old
Bear
told
it.
“Snow,
how
soon
does
Maester
Aemon
say
you’ll
have
use
of
that
hand
back?”

“Soon,”
Jon
replied.

“Good.”
On
the
table
between
them,
Lord
Mormont
laid
a
large
sword
in
a
black
metal
scabbard
banded
with
silver.
“Here.
You’ll
be
ready
for
this,
then.”

The
raven
flapped
down
and
landed
on
the
table,
strutting
toward
the
sword,
head
cocked
curiously.
Jon
hesitated.
He
had
no
inkling
what
this
meant.
“My
lord?”

“The
fire
melted
the
silver
off
the
pommel
and
burnt
the
crossguard
and
grip.
Well,
dry
leather
and
old
wood,
what
could
you
expect?
The
blade,
now…
you’d
need
a
fire
a
hundred
times
as
hot
to
harm
the
blade.”
Mormont
shoved
the
scabbard
across
the
rough
oak
planks.
“I
had
the
rest
made
anew.
Take
it.”

“Take
it,”
echoed
his
raven,
preening.
“Take
it,
take
it.”

Awkwardly,
Jon
took
the
sword
in
hand.
His
left
hand;
his
bandaged
right
was
still
too
raw
and
clumsy.
Carefully
he
pulled
it
from
its
scabbard
and
raised
it
level
with
his
eyes.

The
pommel
was
a
hunk
of
pale
stone
weighted
with
lead
to
balance
the
long
blade.
It
had
been
carved
into
the
likeness
of
a
snarling
wolf’s
head,
with
chips
of
garnet
set
into
the
eyes.
The
grip
was
virgin
leather,
soft
and
black,
as
yet
unstained
by
sweat
or
blood.
The
blade
itself
was
a
good
half
foot
longer
than
those
Jon
was
used
to,
tapered
to
thrust
as
well
as
slash,
with
three
fullers
deeply
incised
in
the
metal.
Where
Ice
was
a
true
two-handed
greatsword,
this
was
a
hand-and-a-halfer,
sometimes
named
a
“bastard
sword.”
Yet
the
wolf
sword
actually
seemed
lighter
than
the
blades
he
had
wielded
before.
When
Jon
turned
it
sideways,
he
could
see
the
ripples
in
the
dark
steel
where
the
metal
had
been
folded
back
on
itself
again
and
again.
“This
is
Valyrian
steel,
my
lord,”
he
said
wonderingly.
His
father
had
let
him
handle
Ice
often
enough;
he
knew
the
look,
the
feel.

“It
is,”
the
Old
Bear
told
him.
“It
was
my
father’s
sword,
and
his
father’s
before
him.
The
Mormonts
have
carried
it
for
five
centuries.
I
wielded
it
in
my
day
and
passed
it
on
to
my
son
when
I
took
the
black.”

He
is
giving
me
his
son’s
sword.
Jon
could
scarcely
believe
it.
The
blade
was
exquisitely
balanced.
The
edges
glimmered
faintly
as
they
kissed
the
light.
“Your
son—”

“My
son
brought
dishonor
to
House
Mormont,
but
at
least
he
had
the
grace
to
leave
the
sword
behind
when
he
fled.
My
sister
returned
it
to
my
keeping,
but
the
very
sight
of
it
reminded
me
of
Jorah’s
shame,
so
I
put
it
aside
and
thought
no
more
of
it
until
we
found
it
in
the
ashes
of
my
bedchamber.
The
original
pommel
was
a
bear’s
head,
silver,
yet
so
worn
its
features
were
all
but
indistinguishable.
For
you,
I
thought
a
white
wolf
more
apt.
One
of
our
builders
is
a
fair
stonecarver.”

When
Jon
had
been
Bran’s
age,
he
had
dreamed
of
doing
great
deeds,
as
boys
always
did.
The
details
of
his
feats
changed
with
every
dreaming,
but
quite
often
he
imagined
saving
his
father’s
life.
Afterward
Lord
Eddard
would
declare
that
Jon
had
proved
himself
a
true
Stark,
and
place
Ice
in
his
hand.
Even
then
he
had
known
it
was
only
a
child’s
folly;
no
bastard
could
ever
hope
to
wield
a
father’s
sword.
Even
the
memory
shamed
him.
What
kind
of
man
stole
his
own
brother’s
birthright?
I
have
no
right
to
this,
he
thought,
no
more
than
to
Ice.
He
twitched
his
burned
fingers,
feeling
a
throb
of
pain
deep
under
the
skin.
“My
lord,
you
honor
me,
but—”

“Spare
me
your
but’s,
boy,”
Lord
Mormont
interrupted.
“I
would
not
be
sitting
here
were
it
not
for
you
and
that
beast
of
yours.
You
fought
bravely…
and
more
to
the
point,
you
thought
quickly.
Fire!
Yes,
damn
it.
We
ought
to
have
known.
We
ought
to
have
remembered.
The
Long
Night
has
come
before.
Oh,
eight
thousand
years
is
a
good
while,
to
be
sure…
yet
if
the
Night’s
Watch
does
not
remember,
who
will?”

“Who
will,”
chimed
the
talkative
raven.
“Who
will.”

Truly,
the
gods
had
heard
Jon’s
prayer
that
night;
the
fire
had
caught
in
the
dead
man’s
clothing
and
consumed
him
as
if
his
flesh
were
candle
wax
and
his
bones
old
dry
wood.
Jon
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
the
thing
staggering
across
the
solar,
crashing
against
the
furniture
and
flailing
at
the
flames.
It
was
the
face
that
haunted
him
most;
surrounded
by
a
nimbus
of
fire,
hair
blazing
like
straw,
the
dead
flesh
melting
away
and
sloughing
off
its
skull
to
reveal
the
gleam
of
bone
beneath.

Whatever
demonic
force
moved
Othor
had
been
driven
out
by
the
flames;
the
twisted
thing
they
had
found
in
the
ashes
had
been
no
more
than
cooked
meat
and
charred
bone.
Yet
in
his
nightmare
he
faced
it
again…
and
this
time
the
burning
corpse
wore
Lord
Eddard’s
features.
It
was
his
father’s
skin
that
burst
and
blackened,
his
father’s
eyes
that
ran
liquid
down
his
cheeks
like
jellied
tears.
Jon
did
not
understand
why
that
should
be
or
what
it
might
mean,
but
it
frightened
him
more
than
he
could
say.

“A
sword’s
small
payment
for
a
life,”
Mormont
concluded.
“Take
it,
I’ll
hear
no
more
of
it,
is
that
understood?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
The
soft
leather
gave
beneath
Jon’s
fingers,
as
if
the
sword
were
molding
itself
to
his
grip
already.
He
knew
he
should
be
honored,
and
he
was,
and
yet…

He
is
not
my
father.
The
thought
leapt
unbidden
to
Jon’s
mind.
Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
my
father.
I
will
not
forget
him,
no
matter
how
many
swords
they
give
me.
Yet
he
could
scarcely
tell
Lord
Mormont
that
it
was
another
man’s
sword
he
dreamt
of…

“I
want
no
courtesies
either,”
Mormont
said,
“so
thank
me
no
thanks.
Honor
the
steel
with
deeds,
not
words.”

Jon
nodded.
“Does
it
have
a
name,
my
lord?”

“It
did,
once.
Longclaw,
it
was
called.”

“Claw,”
the
raven
cried.
“Claw.”

“Longclaw
is
an
apt
name.”
Jon
tried
a
practice
cut.
He
was
clumsy
and
uncomfortable
with
his
left
hand,
yet
even
so
the
steel
seemed
to
flow
through
the
air,
as
if
it
had
a
will
of
its
own.
“Wolves
have
claws,
as
much
as
bears.”

The
Old
Bear
seemed
pleased
by
that.
“I
suppose
they
do.
You’ll
want
to
wear
that
over
the
shoulder,
I
imagine.
It’s
too
long
for
the
hip,
at
least
until
you’ve
put
on
a
few
inches.
And
you’ll
need
to
work
at
your
two-handed
strikes
as
well.
Ser
Endrew
can
show
you
some
moves,
when
your
burns
have
healed.”

“Ser
Endrew?”
Jon
did
not
know
the
name.

“Ser
Endrew
Tarth,
a
good
man.
He’s
on
his
way
from
the
Shadow
Tower
to
assume
the
duties
of
master-at-arms.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
left
yestermorn
for
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.”

Jon
lowered
the
sword.
“Why?”
he
said,
stupidly.

Mormont
snorted.
“Because
I
sent
him,
why
do
you
think?
He’s
bringing
the
hand
your
Ghost
tore
off
the
end
of
Jafer
Flowers’s
wrist.
I
have
commanded
him
to
take
ship
to
King’s
Landing
and
lay
it
before
this
boy
king.
That
should
get
young
Joffrey’s
attention,
I’d
think…
and
Ser
Alliser’s
a
knight,
highborn,
anointed,
with
old
friends
at
court,
altogether
harder
to
ignore
than
a
glorified
crow.”

“Crow.”
Jon
thought
the
raven
sounded
faintly
indignant.

“As
well,”
the
Lord
Commander
continued,
ignoring
the
bird’s
protest,
“it
puts
a
thousand
leagues
twixt
him
and
you
without
it
seeming
a
rebuke.”
He
jabbed
a
finger
up
at
Jon’s
face.
“And
don’t
think
this
means
I
approve
of
that
nonsense
in
the
common
hall.
Valor
makes
up
for
a
fair
amount
of
folly,
but
you’re
not
a
boy
anymore,
however
many
years
you’ve
seen.
That’s
a
man’s
sword
you
have
there,
and
it
will
take
a
man
to
wield
her.
I’ll
expect
you
to
act
the
part,
henceforth.”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
Jon
slid
the
sword
back
into
the
silver-banded
scabbard.
If
not
the
blade
he
would
have
chosen,
it
was
nonetheless
a
noble
gift,
and
freeing
him
from
Alliser
Thorne’s
malignance
was
nobler
still.

The
Old
Bear
scratched
at
his
chin.
“I
had
forgotten
how
much
a
new
beard
itches,”
he
said.
“Well,
no
help
for
that.
Is
that
hand
of
yours
healed
enough
to
resume
your
duties?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”

“Good.
The
night
will
be
cold,
I’ll
want
hot
spice
wine.
Find
me
a
flagon
of
red,
not
too
sour,
and
don’t
skimp
on
the
spices.
And
tell
Hobb
that
if
he
sends
me
boiled
mutton
again
I’m
like
to
boil
him.
That
last
haunch
was
grey.
Even
the
bird
wouldn’t
touch
it.”
He
stroked
the
raven’s
head
with
his
thumb,
and
the
bird
made
a
contented
quorking
sound.
“Away
with
you.
I’ve
work
to
do.”

The
guards
smiled
at
him
from
their
niches
as
he
wound
his
way
down
the
turret
stair,
carrying
the
sword
in
his
good
hand.
“Sweet
steel,”
one
man
said.
“You
earned
that,
Snow,”
another
told
him.
Jon
made
himself
smile
back
at
them,
but
his
heart
was
not
in
it.
He
knew
he
should
be
pleased,
yet
he
did
not
feel
it.
His
hand
ached,
and
the
taste
of
anger
was
in
his
mouth,
though
he
could
not
have
said
who
he
was
angry
with
or
why.

A
half
dozen
of
his
friends
were
lurking
outside
when
he
left
the
King’s
Tower,
where
Lord
Commander
Mormont
now
made
his
residence.
They’d
hung
a
target
on
the
granary
doors,
so
they
could
seem
to
be
honing
their
skills
as
archers,
but
he
knew
lurkers
when
he
saw
them.
No
sooner
did
he
emerge
than
Pyp
called
out,
“Well,
come
about,
let’s
have
a
look.”

“At
what?”
Jon
said.

Toad
sidled
close.
“Your
rosy
butt
cheeks,
what
else?”

“The
sword,”
Grenn
stated.
“We
want
to
see
the
sword.”

Jon
raked
them
with
an
accusing
look.
“You
knew.”

Pyp
grinned.
“We’re
not
all
as
dumb
as
Grenn.”

“You
are
so,”
insisted
Grenn.
“You’re
dumber.”

Halder
gave
an
apologetic
shrug.
“I
helped
Pate
carve
the
stone
for
the
pommel,”
the
builder
said,
“and
your
friend
Sam
bought
the
garnets
in
Mole’s
Town.”

“We
knew
even
before
that,
though,”
Grenn
said.
“Rudge
has
been
helping
Donal
Noye
in
the
forge.
He
was
there
when
the
Old
Bear
brought
him
the
burnt
blade.”

“The
sword!”
Matt
insisted.
The
others
took
up
the
chant.
“The
sword,
the
sword,
the
sword.”

Jon
unsheathed
Longclaw
and
showed
it
to
them,
turning
it
this
way
and
that
so
they
could
admire
it.
The
bastard
blade
glittered
in
the
pale
sunlight,
dark
and
deadly.
“Valyrian
steel,”
he
declared
solemnly,
trying
to
sound
as
pleased
and
proud
as
he
ought
to
have
felt.

“I
heard
of
a
man
who
had
a
razor
made
of
Valyrian
steel,”
declared
Toad.
“He
cut
his
head
off
trying
to
shave.”

Pyp
grinned.
“The
Night’s
Watch
is
thousands
of
years
old,”
he
said,
“but
I’ll
wager
Lord
Snow’s
the
first
brother
ever
honored
for
burning
down
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower.”

The
others
laughed,
and
even
Jon
had
to
smile.
The
fire
he’d
started
had
not,
in
truth,
burned
down
that
formidable
stone
tower,
but
it
had
done
a
fair
job
of
gutting
the
interior
of
the
top
two
floors,
where
the
Old
Bear
had
his
chambers.
No
one
seemed
to
mind
that
very
much,
since
it
had
also
destroyed
Othor’s
murderous
corpse.

The
other
wight,
the
one-handed
thing
that
had
once
been
a
ranger
named
Jafer
Flowers,
had
also
been
destroyed,
cut
near
to
pieces
by
a
dozen
swords…
but
not
before
it
had
slain
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
and
four
other
men.
Ser
Jaremy
had
finished
the
job
of
hacking
its
head
off,
yet
had
died
all
the
same
when
the
headless
corpse
pulled
his
own
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
buried
it
in
his
bowels.
Strength
and
courage
did
not
avail
much
against
foemen
who
would
not
fall
because
they
were
already
dead;
even
arms
and
armor
offered
small
protection.

That
grim
thought
soured
Jon’s
fragile
mood.
“I
need
to
see
Hobb
about
the
Old
Bear’s
supper,”
he
announced
brusquely,
sliding
Longclaw
back
into
its
scabbard.
His
friends
meant
well,
but
they
did
not
understand.
It
was
not
their
fault,
truly;
they
had
not
had
to
face
Othor,
they
had
not
seen
the
pale
glow
of
those
dead
blue
eyes,
had
not
felt
the
cold
of
those
dead
black
fingers.
Nor
did
they
know
of
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands.
How
could
they
hope
to
comprehend?
He
turned
away
from
them
abruptly
and
strode
off,
sullen.
Pyp
called
after
him,
but
Jon
paid
him
no
mind.

They
had
moved
him
back
to
his
old
cell
in
tumbledown
Hardin’s
Tower
after
the
fire,
and
it
was
there
he
returned.
Ghost
was
curled
up
asleep
beside
the
door,
but
he
lifted
his
head
at
the
sound
of
Jon’s
boots.
The
direwolf’s
red
eyes
were
darker
than
garnets
and
wiser
than
men.
Jon
knelt,
scratched
his
ear,
and
showed
him
the
pommel
of
the
sword.
“Look.
It’s
you.”

Ghost
sniffed
at
his
carved
stone
likeness
and
tried
a
lick.
Jon
smiled.
“You’re
the
one
deserves
an
honor,”
he
told
the
wolf…
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
remembering
how
he’d
found
him,
that
day
in
the
late
summer
snow.
They
had
been
riding
off
with
the
other
pups,
but
Jon
had
heard
a
noise
and
turned
back,
and
there
he
was,
white
fur
almost
invisible
against
the
drifts.
He
was
all
alone,
he
thought,
apart
from
the
others
in
the
litter.
He
was
different,
so
they
drove
him
out.

“Jon?”
He
looked
up.
Samwell
Tarly
stood
rocking
nervously
on
his
heels.
His
cheeks
were
red,
and
he
was
wrapped
in
a
heavy
fur
cloak
that
made
him
look
ready
for
hibernation.

“Sam.”
Jon
stood.
“What
is
it?
Do
you
want
to
see
the
sword?”
If
the
others
had
known,
no
doubt
Sam
did
too.

The
fat
boy
shook
his
head.
“I
was
heir
to
my
father’s
blade
once,”
he
said
mournfully.
“Heartsbane.
Lord
Randyll
let
me
hold
it
a
few
times,
but
it
always
scared
me.
It
was
Valyrian
steel,
beautiful
but
so
sharp
I
was
afraid
I’d
hurt
one
of
my
sisters.
Dickon
will
have
it
now.”
He
wiped
sweaty
hands
on
his
cloak.
“I
ah…
Maester
Aemon
wants
to
see
you.”

It
was
not
time
for
his
bandages
to
be
changed.
Jon
frowned
suspiciously.
“Why?”
he
demanded.
Sam
looked
miserable.
That
was
answer
enough.
“You
told
him,
didn’t
you?”
Jon
said
angrily.
“You
told
him
that
you
told
me.”

“I…
he…
Jon,
I
didn’t
want
to…
he
asked…
I
mean
I
think
he
knew,
he
sees
things
no
one
else
sees…”

“He’s
blind,”
Jon
pointed
out
forcefully,
disgusted.
“I
can
find
the
way
myself.”
He
left
Sam
standing
there,
openmouthed
and
quivering.

He
found
Maester
Aemon
up
in
the
rookery,
feeding
the
ravens.
Clydas
was
with
him,
carrying
a
bucket
of
chopped
meat
as
they
shuffled
from
cage
to
cage.
“Sam
said
you
wanted
me?”

The
maester
nodded.
“I
did
indeed.
Clydas,
give
Jon
the
bucket.
Perhaps
he
will
be
kind
enough
to
assist
me.”
The
hunched,
pink-eyed
brother
handed
Jon
the
bucket
and
scurried
down
the
ladder.
“Toss
the
meat
into
the
cages,”
Aemon
instructed
him.
“The
birds
will
do
the
rest.
“

Jon
shifted
the
bucket
to
his
right
hand
and
thrust
his
left
down
into
the
bloody
bits.
The
ravens
began
to
scream
noisily
and
fly
at
the
bars,
beating
at
the
metal
with
night-black
wings.
The
meat
had
been
chopped
into
pieces
no
larger
than
a
finger
joint.
He
filled
his
fist
and
tossed
the
raw
red
morsels
into
the
cage,
and
the
squawking
and
squabbling
grew
hotter.
Feathers
flew
as
two
of
the
larger
birds
fought
over
a
choice
piece.
Quickly
Jon
grabbed
a
second
handful
and
threw
it
in
after
the
first.
“Lord
Mormont’s
raven
likes
fruit
and
corn.”

“He
is
a
rare
bird,”
the
maester
said.
“Most
ravens
will
eat
grain,
but
they
prefer
flesh.
It
makes
them
strong,
and
I
fear
they
relish
the
taste
of
blood.
In
that
they
are
like
men…
and
like
men,
not
all
ravens
are
alike.”

Jon
had
nothing
to
say
to
that.
He
threw
meat,
wondering
why
he’d
been
summoned.
No
doubt
the
old
man
would
tell
him,
in
his
own
good
time.
Maester
Aemon
was
not
a
man
to
be
hurried.

“Doves
and
pigeons
can
also
be
trained
to
carry
messages,”
the
maester
went
on,
“though
the
raven
is
a
stronger
flyer,
larger,
bolder,
far
more
clever,
better
able
to
defend
itself
against
hawks…
yet
ravens
are
black,
and
they
eat
the
dead,
so
some
godly
men
abhor
them.
Baelor
the
Blessed
tried
to
replace
all
the
ravens
with
doves,
did
you
know?”
The
maester
turned
his
white
eyes
on
Jon,
smiling.
“The
Night’s
Watch
prefers
ravens.”

Jon’s
fingers
were
in
the
bucket,
blood
up
to
the
wrist.
“Dywen
says
the
wildlings
call
us
crows,”
he
said
uncertainty.

“The
crow
is
the
raven’s
poor
cousin.
They
are
both
beggars
in
black,
hated
and
misunderstood.”

Jon
wished
he
understood
what
they
were
talking
about,
and
why.
What
did
he
care
about
ravens
and
doves?
If
the
old
man
had
something
to
say
to
him,
why
couldn’t
he
just
say
it?

“Jon,
did
you
ever
wonder
why
the
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch
take
no
wives
and
father
no
children?”
Maester
Aemon
asked.

Jon
shrugged.
“No.”
He
scattered
more
meat.
The
fingers
of
his
left
hand
were
slimy
with
blood,
and
his
right
throbbed
from
the
weight
of
the
bucket.

“So
they
will
not
love,”
the
old
man
answered,
“for
love
is
the
bane
of
honor,
the
death
of
duty.”

That
did
not
sound
right
to
Jon,
yet
he
said
nothing.
The
maester
was
a
hundred
years
old,
and
a
high
officer
of
the
Night’s
Watch;
it
was
not
his
place
to
contradict
him.

The
old
man
seemed
to
sense
his
doubts.
“Tell
me,
Jon,
if
the
day
should
ever
come
when
your
lord
father
must
needs
choose
between
honor
on
the
one
hand
and
those
he
loves
on
the
other,
what
would
he
do?”

Jon
hesitated.
He
wanted
to
say
that
Lord
Eddard
would
never
dishonor
himself,
not
even
for
love,
yet
inside
a
small
sly
voice
whispered,
He
fathered
a
bastard,
where
was
the
honor
in
that?
And
your
mother,
what
of
his
duty
to
her,
he
will
not
even
say
her
name.
“He
would
do
whatever
was
right,”
he
said…
ringingly,
to
make
up
for
his
hesitation.
“No
matter
what.”

“Then
Lord
Eddard
is
a
man
in
ten
thousand.
Most
of
us
are
not
so
strong.
What
is
honor
compared
to
a
woman’s
love?
What
is
duty
against
the
feel
of
a
newborn
son
in
your
arms…
or
the
memory
of
a
brother’s
smile?
Wind
and
words.
Wind
and
words.
We
are
only
human,
and
the
gods
have
fashioned
us
for
love.
That
is
our
great
glory,
and
our
great
tragedy.

“The
men
who
formed
the
Night’s
Watch
knew
that
only
their
courage
shielded
the
realm
from
the
darkness
to
the
north.
They
knew
they
must
have
no
divided
loyalties
to
weaken
their
resolve.
So
they
vowed
they
would
have
no
wives
nor
children.

“Yet
brothers
they
had,
and
sisters.
Mothers
who
gave
them
birth,
fathers
who
gave
them
names.
They
came
from
a
hundred
quarrelsome
kingdoms,
and
they
knew
times
may
change,
but
men
do
not.
So
they
pledged
as
well
that
the
Night’s
Watch
would
take
no
part
in
the
battles
of
the
realms
it
guarded.

“They
kept
their
pledge.
When
Aegon
slew
Black
Harren
and
claimed
his
kingdom,
Harren’s
brother
was
Lord
Commander
on
the
Wall,
with
ten
thousand
swords
to
hand.
He
did
not
march.
In
the
days
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
seven
kingdoms,
not
a
generation
passed
that
three
or
four
of
them
were
not
at
war.
The
Watch
took
no
part.
When
the
Andals
crossed
the
narrow
sea
and
swept
away
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men,
the
sons
of
the
fallen
kings
held
true
to
their
vows
and
remained
at
their
posts.
So
it
has
always
been,
for
years
beyond
counting.
Such
is
the
price
of
honor.

“A
craven
can
be
as
brave
as
any
man,
when
there
is
nothing
to
fear.
And
we
all
do
our
duty,
when
there
is
no
cost
to
it.
How
easy
it
seems
then,
to
walk
the
path
of
honor.
Yet
soon
or
late
in
every
man’s
life
comes
a
day
when
it
is
not
easy,
a
day
when
he
must
choose.”

Some
of
the
ravens
were
still
eating,
long
stringy
bits
of
meat
dangling
from
their
beaks.
The
rest
seemed
to
be
watching
him.
Jon
could
feel
the
weight
of
all
those
tiny
black
eyes.
“And
this
is
my
day…
is
that
what
you’re
saying?”

Maester
Aemon
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
him
with
those
dead
white
eyes.
It
was
as
if
he
were
seeing
right
into
his
heart.
Jon
felt
naked
and
exposed.
He
took
the
bucket
in
both
hands
and
flung
the
rest
of
the
slops
through
the
bars.
Strings
of
meat
and
blood
flew
everywhere,
scattering
the
ravens.
They
took
to
the
air,
shrieking
wildly.
The
quicker
birds
snatched
morsels
on
the
wing
and
gulped
them
down
greedily.
Jon
let
the
empty
bucket
clang
to
the
floor.

The
old
man
laid
a
withered,
spotted
hand
on
his
shoulder.
“It
hurts,
boy,”
he
said
softly.
“Oh,
yes.
Choosing…
it
has
always
hurt.
And
always
will.
I
know.”

“You
don’t
know,”
Jon
said
bitterly.
“No
one
knows.
Even
if
I
am
his
bastard,
he’s
still
my
father…”

Maester
Aemon
sighed.
“Have
you
heard
nothing
I’ve
told
you,
Jon?
Do
you
think
you
are
the
first?”
He
shook
his
ancient
head,
a
gesture
weary
beyond
words.
“Three
times
the
gods
saw
fit
to
test
my
vows.
Once
when
I
was
a
boy,
once
in
the
fullness
of
my
manhood,
and
once
when
I
had
grown
old.
By
then
my
strength
was
fled,
my
eyes
grown
dim,
yet
that
last
choice
was
as
cruel
as
the
first.
My
ravens
would
bring
the
news
from
the
south,
words
darker
than
their
wings,
the
ruin
of
my
House,
the
death
of
my
kin,
disgrace
and
desolation.
What
could
I
have
done,
old,
blind,
frail?
I
was
helpless
as
a
suckling
babe,
yet
still
it
grieved
me
to
sit
forgotten
as
they
cut
down
my
brother’s
poor
grandson,
and
his
son,
and
even
the
little
children…”

Jon
was
shocked
to
see
the
shine
of
tears
in
the
old
man’s
eyes.
“Who
are
you?”
he
asked
quietly,
almost
in
dread.

A
toothless
smile
quivered
on
the
ancient
lips.
“Only
a
maester
of
the
Citadel,
bound
in
service
to
Castle
Black
and
the
Night’s
Watch.
In
my
order,
we
put
aside
our
house
names
when
we
take
our
vows
and
don
the
collar.”
The
old
man
touched
the
maester’s
chain
that
hung
loosely
around
his
thin,
fleshless
neck.
“My
father
was
Maekar,
the
First
of
his
Name,
and
my
brother
Aegon
reigned
after
him
in
my
stead.
My
grandfather
named
me
for
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
who
was
his
uncle,
or
his
father,
depending
on
which
tale
you
believe.
Aemon,
he
called
me…”

“Aemon…
Targaryen?”
Jon
could
scarcely
believe
it.

“Once,”
the
old
man
said.
“Once.
So
you
see,
Jon,
I
do
know…
and
knowing,
I
will
not
tell
you
stay
or
go.
You
must
make
that
choice
yourself,
and
live
with
it
all
the
rest
of
your
days.
As
I
have.”
His
voice
fell
to
a
whisper.
“As
I
have…”





DAENERYS

When
the
battle
was
done,
Dany
rode
her
silver
through
the
fields
of
the
dead.
Her
handmaids
and
the
men
of
her
khas
came
after,
smiling
and
jesting
among
themselves.

Dothraki
hooves
had
torn
the
earth
and
trampled
the
rye
and
lentils
into
the
ground,
while
arakhs
and
arrows
had
sown
a
terrible
new
crop
and
watered
it
with
blood.
Dying
horses
lifted
their
heads
and
screamed
at
her
as
she
rode
past.
Wounded
men
moaned
and
prayed.
Jaqqa
rhan
moved
among
them,
the
mercy
men
with
their
heavy
axes,
taking
a
harvest
of
heads
from
the
dead
and
dying
alike.
After
them
would
scurry
a
flock
of
small
girls,
pulling
arrows
from
the
corpses
to
fill
their
baskets.
Last
of
all
the
dogs
would
come
sniffing,
lean
and
hungry,
the
feral
pack
that
was
never
far
behind
the
khalasar.

The
sheep
had
been
dead
longest.
There
seemed
to
be
thousands
of
them,
black
with
flies,
arrow
shafts
bristling
from
each
carcass.
Khal
Ogo’s
riders
had
done
that,
Dany
knew;
no
man
of
Drogo’s
khalasar
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
waste
his
arrows
on
sheep
when
there
were
shepherds
yet
to
kill.

The
town
was
afire,
black
plumes
of
smoke
roiling
and
tumbling
as
they
rose
into
a
hard
blue
sky.
Beneath
broken
walls
of
dried
mud,
riders
galloped
back
and
forth,
swinging
their
long
whips
as
they
herded
the
survivors
from
the
smoking
rubble.
The
women
and
children
of
Ogo’s
khalasar
walked
with
a
sullen
pride,
even
in
defeat
and
bondage;
they
were
slaves
now,
but
they
seemed
not
to
fear
it.
It
was
different
with
the
townsfolk.
Dany
pitied
them;
she
remembered
what
terror
felt
like.
Mothers
stumbled
along
with
blank,
dead
faces,
pulling
sobbing
children
by
the
hand.
There
were
only
a
few
men
among
them,
cripples
and
cowards
and
grandfathers.

Ser
Jorah
said
the
people
of
this
country
named
themselves
the
Lhazareen,
but
the
Dothraki
called
them
haesh
rakhi,
the
Lamb
Men.
Once
Dany
might
have
taken
them
for
Dothraki,
for
they
had
the
same
copper
skin
and
almond-shaped
eyes.
Now
they
looked
alien
to
her,
squat
and
flat-faced,
their
black
hair
cropped
unnaturally
short.
They
were
herders
of
sheep
and
eaters
of
vegetables,
and
Khal
Drogo
said
they
belonged
south
of
the
river
bend.
The
grass
of
the
Dothraki
sea
was
not
meant
for
sheep.

Dany
saw
one
boy
bolt
and
run
for
the
river.
A
rider
cut
him
off
and
turned
him,
and
the
others
boxed
him
in,
cracking
their
whips
in
his
face,
running
him
this
way
and
that.
One
galloped
behind
him,
lashing
him
across
the
buttocks
until
his
thighs
ran
red
with
blood.
Another
snared
his
ankle
with
a
lash
and
sent
him
sprawling.
Finally,
when
the
boy
could
only
crawl,
they
grew
bored
of
the
sport
and
put
an
arrow
through
his
back.

Ser
Jorah
met
her
outside
the
shattered
gate.
He
wore
a
dark
green
surcoat
over
his
mail.
His
gauntlets,
greaves,
and
greathelm
were
dark
grey
steel.
The
Dothraki
had
mocked
him
for
a
coward
when
he
donned
his
armor,
but
the
knight
had
spit
insults
right
back
in
their
teeth,
tempers
had
flared,
longsword
had
clashed
with
arakh,
and
the
rider
whose
taunts
had
been
loudest
had
been
left
behind
to
bleed
to
death.

Ser
Jorah
lifted
the
visor
of
his
flat-topped
greathelm
as
he
rode
up.
“Your
lord
husband
awaits
you
within
the
town.”

“Drogo
took
no
harm?”

“A
few
cuts,”
Ser
Jorah
answered,
“nothing
of
consequence.
He
slew
two
khals
this
day.
Khal
Ogo
first,
and
then
the
son,
Fogo,
who
became
khal
when
Ogo
fell.
His
bloodriders
cut
the
bells
from
their
hair,
and
now
Khal
Drogo’s
every
step
rings
louder
than
before.”

Ogo
and
his
son
had
shared
the
high
bench
with
her
lord
husband
at
the
naming
feast
where
Viserys
had
been
crowned,
but
that
was
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
where
every
rider
was
a
brother
and
all
quarrels
were
put
aside.
It
was
different
out
in
the
grass.
Ogo’s
khalasar
had
been
attacking
the
town
when
Khal
Drogo
caught
him.
She
wondered
what
the
Lamb
Men
had
thought,
when
they
first
saw
the
dust
of
their
horses
from
atop
those
cracked-mud
walls.
Perhaps
a
few,
the
younger
and
more
foolish
who
still
believed
that
the
gods
heard
the
prayers
of
desperate
men,
took
it
for
deliverance.

Across
the
road,
a
girl
no
older
than
Dany
was
sobbing
in
a
high
thin
voice
as
a
rider
shoved
her
over
a
pile
of
corpses,
facedown,
and
thrust
himself
inside
her.
Other
riders
dismounted
to
take
their
turns.
That
was
the
sort
of
deliverance
the
Dothraki
brought
the
Lamb
Men.

I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
Daenerys
Targaryen
reminded
herself
as
she
turned
her
face
away.
She
pressed
her
lips
together
and
hardened
her
heart
and
rode
on
toward
the
gate.

“Most
of
Ogo’s
riders
fled,”
Ser
Jorah
was
saying.
“Still,
there
may
be
as
many
as
ten
thousand
captives.”

Slaves,
Dany
thought.
Khal
Drogo
would
drive
them
downriver
to
one
of
the
towns
on
Slaver’s
Bay.
She
wanted
to
cry,
but
she
told
herself
that
she
must
be
strong.
This
is
war,
this
is
what
it
looks
like,
this
is
the
price
of
the
Iron
Throne.

“I’ve
told
the
khal
he
ought
to
make
for
Meereen,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“They’ll
pay
a
better
price
than
he’d
get
from
a
slaving
caravan.
Illyrio
writes
that
they
had
a
plague
last
year,
so
the
brothels
are
paying
double
for
healthy
young
girls,
and
triple
for
boys
under
ten.
If
enough
children
survive
the
journey,
the
gold
will
buy
us
all
the
ships
we
need,
and
hire
men
to
sail
them.”

Behind
them,
the
girl
being
raped
made
a
heartrending
sound,
a
long
sobbing
wail
that
went
on
and
on
and
on.
Dany’s
hand
clenched
hard
around
the
reins,
and
she
turned
the
silver’s
head.
“Make
them
stop,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.

“Khaleesi?”
The
knight
sounded
perplexed.

“You
heard
my
words,”
she
said.
“Stop
them.”
She
spoke
to
her
khas
in
the
harsh
accents
of
Dothraki.
“Jhogo,
Quaro,
you
will
aid
Ser
Jorah.
I
want
no
rape.”

The
warriors
exchanged
a
baffled
look.

Jorah
Mormont
spurred
his
horse
closer.
“Princess,”
he
said,
“you
have
a
gentle
heart,
but
you
do
not
understand.
This
is
how
it
has
always
been.
Those
men
have
shed
blood
for
the
khal.
Now
they
claim
their
reward.”

Across
the
road,
the
girl
was
still
crying,
her
high
singsong
tongue
strange
to
Dany’s
ears.
The
first
man
was
done
with
her
now,
and
a
second
had
taken
his
place.

“She
is
a
lamb
girl,”
Quaro
said
in
Dothraki.
“She
is
nothing,
Khaleesi.
The
riders
do
her
honor.
The
Lamb
Men
lay
with
sheep,
it
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
her
handmaid
Irri
echoed.

“It
is
known,”
agreed
Jhogo,
astride
the
tall
grey
stallion
that
Drogo
had
given
him.
“If
her
wailing
offends
your
ears,
Khaleesi,
Jhogo
will
bring
you
her
tongue.”
He
drew
his
arakh.

“I
will
not
have
her
harmed,”
Dany
said.
“I
claim
her.
Do
as
I
command
you,
or
Khal
Drogo
will
know
the
reason
why.”

“Ai,
Khaleesi,”
Jhogo
replied,
kicking
his
horse.
Quaro
and
the
others
followed
his
lead,
the
bells
in
their
hair
chiming.

“Go
with
them,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.

“As
you
command.”
The
knight
gave
her
a
curious
look.
“You
are
your
brother’s
sister,
in
truth.”

“Viserys?”
She
did
not
understand.

“No,”
he
answered.
“Rhaegar.”
He
galloped
off.

Dany
heard
Jhogo
shout.
The
rapers
laughed
at
him.
One
man
shouted
back.
Jhogo’s
arakh
flashed,
and
the
man’s
head
went
tumbling
from
his
shoulders.
Laughter
turned
to
curses
as
the
horsemen
reached
for
weapons,
but
by
then
Quaro
and
Aggo
and
Rakharo
were
there.
She
saw
Aggo
point
across
the
road
to
where
she
sat
upon
her
silver.
The
riders
looked
at
her
with
cold
black
eyes.
One
spat.
The
others
scattered
to
their
mounts,
muttering.

All
the
while
the
man
atop
the
lamb
girl
continued
to
plunge
in
and
out
of
her,
so
intent
on
his
pleasure
that
he
seemed
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
around
him.
Ser
Jorah
dismounted
and
wrenched
him
off
with
a
mailed
hand.
The
Dothraki
went
sprawling
in
the
mud,
bounced
up
with
a
knife
in
hand,
and
died
with
Aggo’s
arrow
through
his
throat.
Mormont
pulled
the
girl
off
the
pile
of
corpses
and
wrapped
her
in
his
blood-spattered
cloak.
He
led
her
across
the
road
to
Dany.
“What
do
you
want
done
with
her?”

The
girl
was
trembling,
her
eyes
wide
and
vague.
Her
hair
was
matted
with
blood.
“Doreah,
see
to
her
hurts.
You
do
not
have
a
rider’s
look,
perhaps
she
will
not
fear
you.
The
rest,
with
me.”
She
urged
the
silver
through
the
broken
wooden
gate.

It
was
worse
inside
the
town.
Many
of
the
houses
were
afire,
and
the
jaqqa
rhan
had
been
about
their
grisly
work.
Headless
corpses
filled
the
narrow,
twisty
lanes.
They
passed
other
women
being
raped.
Each
time
Dany
reined
up,
sent
her
khas
to
make
an
end
to
it,
and
claimed
the
victim
as
slave.
One
of
them,
a
thick-bodied,
flat-nosed
woman
of
forty
years,
blessed
Dany
haltingly
in
the
Common
Tongue,
but
from
the
others
she
got
only
flat
black
stares.
They
were
suspicious
of
her,
she
realized
with
sadness;
afraid
that
she
had
saved
them
for
some
worse
fate.

“You
cannot
claim
them
all,
child,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
the
fourth
time
they
stopped,
while
the
warriors
of
her
khas
herded
her
new
slaves
behind
her.

“I
am
khaleesi,
heir
to
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
the
blood
of
the
dragon,”
Dany
reminded
him.
“It
is
not
for
you
to
tell
me
what
I
cannot
do.”
Across
the
city,
a
building
collapsed
in
a
great
gout
of
fire
and
smoke,
and
she
heard
distant
screams
and
the
wailing
of
frightened
children.

They
found
Khal
Drogo
seated
before
a
square
windowless
temple
with
thick
mud
walls
and
a
bulbous
dome
like
some
immense
brown
onion.
Beside
him
was
a
pile
of
heads
taller
than
he
was.
One
of
the
short
arrows
of
the
Lamb
Men
stuck
through
the
meat
of
his
upper
arm,
and
blood
covered
the
left
side
of
his
bare
chest
like
a
splash
of
paint.
His
three
bloodriders
were
with
him.

Jhiqui
helped
Dany
dismount;
she
had
grown
clumsy
as
her
belly
grew
larger
and
heavier.
She
knelt
before
the
khal.
“My
sun-and-stars
is
wounded.”
The
arakh
cut
was
wide
but
shallow;
his
left
nipple
was
gone,
and
a
flap
of
bloody
flesh
and
skin
dangled
from
his
chest
like
a
wet
rag.

“Is
scratch,
moon
of
life,
from
arakh
of
one
bloodrider
to
Khal
Ogo,”
Khal
Drogo
said
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“I
kill
him
for
it,
and
Ogo
too.”
He
turned
his
head,
the
bells
in
his
braid
ringing
softly.
“Is
Ogo
you
hear,
and
Fogo
his
khalakka,
who
was
khal
when
I
slew
him.”

“No
man
can
stand
before
the
sun
of
my
life,”
Dany
said,
“the
father
of
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”

A
mounted
warrior
rode
up
and
vaulted
from
his
saddle.
He
spoke
to
Haggo,
a
stream
of
angry
Dothraki
too
fast
for
Dany
to
understand.
The
huge
bloodrider
gave
her
a
heavy
look
before
he
turned
to
his
khal
“This
one
is
Mago,
who
rides
in
the
khas
of
Ko
Jhaqo.
He
says
the
khaleesi
has
taken
his
spoils,
a
daughter
of
the
lambs
who
was
his
to
mount.”

Khal
Drogo’s
face
was
still
and
hard,
but
his
black
eyes
were
curious
as
they
went
to
Dany.
“Tell
me
the
truth
of
this,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
commanded
in
Dothraki.

Dany
told
him
what
she
had
done,
in
his
own
tongue
so
the
khal
would
understand
her
better,
her
words
simple
and
direct.

When
she
was
done,
Drogo
was
frowning.
“This
is
the
way
of
war.
These
women
are
our
slaves
now,
to
do
with
as
we
please.”

“It
pleases
me
to
hold
them
safe,”
Dany
said,
wondering
if
she
had
dared
too
much.
“If
your
warriors
would
mount
these
women,
let
them
take
them
gently
and
keep
them
for
wives.
Give
them
places
in
the
khalasar
and
let
them
bear
you
sons.”

Qotho
was
ever
the
cruelest
of
the
bloodriders.
It
was
he
who
laughed.
“Does
the
horse
breed
with
the
sheep?”

Something
in
his
tone
reminded
her
of
Viserys.
Dany
turned
on
him
angrily.
“The
dragon
feeds
on
horse
and
sheep
alike.”

Khal
Drogo
smiled.
“See
how
fierce
she
grows!”
he
said.
“It
is
my
son
inside
her,
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world,
filling
her
with
his
fire.
Ride
slowly,
Qotho…
if
the
mother
does
not
burn
you
where
you
sit,
the
son
will
trample
you
into
the
mud.
And
you,
Mago,
hold
your
tongue
and
find
another
lamb
to
mount.
These
belong
to
my
khaleesi.”
He
started
to
reach
out
a
hand
to
Daenerys,
but
as
he
lifted
his
arm
Drogo
grimaced
in
sudden
pain
and
turned
his
head.

Dany
could
almost
feel
his
agony.
The
wounds
were
worse
than
Ser
Jorah
had
led
her
to
believe.
“Where
are
the
healers?”
she
demanded.
The
khalasar
had
two
sorts:
barren
women
and
eunuch
slaves.
The
herbwomen
dealt
in
potions
and
spells,
the
eunuchs
in
knife,
needle,
and
fire.
“Why
do
they
not
attend
the
khal?”

“The
khal
sent
the
hairless
men
away,
Khaleesi,”
old
Cohollo
assured
her.
Dany
saw
the
bloodrider
had
taken
a
wound
himself;
a
deep
gash
in
his
left
shoulder.

“Many
riders
are
hurt,”
Khal
Drogo
said
stubbornly.
“Let
them
be
healed
first.
This
arrow
is
no
more
than
the
bite
of
a
fly,
this
little
cut
only
a
new
scar
to
boast
of
to
my
son.”

Dany
could
see
the
muscles
in
his
chest
where
the
skin
had
been
cut
away.
A
trickle
of
blood
ran
from
the
arrow
that
pierced
his
arm.
“It
is
not
for
Khal
Drogo
to
wait,”
she
proclaimed.
“Jhogo,
seek
out
these
eunuchs
and
bring
them
here
at
once.”

“Silver
Lady,”
a
woman’s
voice
said
behind
her,
“I
can
help
the
Great
Rider
with
his
hurts.”

Dany
turned
her
head.
The
speaker
was
one
of
the
slaves
she
had
claimed,
the
heavy,
flat-nosed
woman
who
had
blessed
her.

“The
khal
needs
no
help
from
women
who
lie
with
sheep,”
barked
Qotho.
“Aggo,
cut
out
her
tongue.”

Aggo
grabbed
her
hair
and
pressed
a
knife
to
her
throat.

Dany
lifted
a
hand.
“No.
She
is
mine.
Let
her
speak.”

Aggo
looked
from
her
to
Qotho.
He
lowered
his
knife.

“I
meant
no
wrong,
fierce
riders.”
The
woman
spoke
Dothraki
well.
The
robes
she
wore
had
once
been
the
lightest
and
finest
of
woolens,
rich
with
embroidery,
but
now
they
were
mud-caked
and
bloody
and
ripped.
She
clutched
the
torn
cloth
of
her
bodice
to
her
heavy
breasts.
“I
have
some
small
skill
in
the
healing
arts.”

“Who
are
you?”
Dany
asked
her.

“I
am
named
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
I
am
godswife
of
this
temple.”

“Maegi,”
grunted
Haggo,
fingering
his
arakh.
His
look
was
dark.
Dany
remembered
the
word
from
a
terrifying
story
that
Jhiqui
had
told
her
one
night
by
the
cookfire.
A
maegi
was
a
woman
who
lay
with
demons
and
practiced
the
blackest
of
sorceries,
a
vile
thing,
evil
and
soulless,
who
came
to
men
in
the
dark
of
night
and
sucked
life
and
strength
from
their
bodies.

“I
am
a
healer,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said.

“A
healer
of
sheeps,”
sneered
Qotho.
“Blood
of
my
blood,
I
say
kill
this
maegi
and
wait
for
the
hairless
men.”

Dany
ignored
the
bloodrider’s
outburst.
This
old,
homely,
thickbodied
woman
did
not
look
like
a
maegi
to
her.
“Where
did
you
learn
your
healing,
Mirri
Maz
Duur?”

“My
mother
was
godswife
before
me,
and
taught
me
all
the
songs
and
spells
most
pleasing
to
the
Great
Shepherd,
and
how
to
make
the
sacred
smokes
and
ointments
from
leaf
and
root
and
berry.
When
I
was
younger
and
more
fair,
I
went
in
caravan
to
Asshai
by
the
Shadow,
to
learn
from
their
mages.
Ships
from
many
lands
come
to
Asshai,
so
I
lingered
long
to
study
the
healing
ways
of
distant
peoples.
A
moonsinger
of
the
Jogos
Nhai
gifted
me
with
her
birthing
songs,
a
woman
of
your
own
riding
people
taught
me
the
magics
of
grass
and
corn
and
horse,
and
a
maester
from
the
Sunset
Lands
opened
a
body
for
me
and
showed
me
all
the
secrets
that
hide
beneath
the
skin.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
spoke
up.
“A
maester?”

“Marwyn,
he
named
himself,”
the
woman
replied
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“From
the
sea.
Beyond
the
sea.
The
Seven
Lands,
he
said.
Sunset
Lands.
Where
men
are
iron
and
dragons
rule.
He
taught
me
this
speech.”

“A
maester
in
Asshai,”
Ser
Jorah
mused.
“Tell
me,
Godswife,
what
did
this
Marwyn
wear
about
his
neck?”

“A
chain
so
tight
it
was
like
to
choke
him,
Iron
Lord,
with
links
of
many
metals.”

The
knight
looked
at
Dany.
“Only
a
man
trained
in
the
Citadel
of
Oldtown
wears
such
a
chain,”
he
said,
“and
such
men
do
know
much
of
healing.”

“Why
should
you
want
to
help
my
khal?”

“All
men
are
one
flock,
or
so
we
are
taught,”
replied
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“The
Great
Shepherd
sent
me
to
earth
to
heal
his
lambs,
wherever
I
might
find
them.”

Qotho
gave
her
a
stinging
slap.
“We
are
no
sheep,
maegi.”

“Stop
it,”
Dany
said
angrily.
“She
is
mine.
I
will
not
have
her
harmed.”

Khal
Drogo
grunted.
“The
arrow
must
come
out,
Qotho.”

“Yes,
Great
Rider,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
answered,
touching
her
bruised
face.
“And
your
breast
must
be
washed
and
sewn,
lest
the
wound
fester.”

“Do
it,
then,”
Khal
Drogo
commanded.

“Great
Rider,”
the
woman
said,
“my
tools
and
potions
are
inside
the
god’s
house,
where
the
healing
powers
are
strongest.”

“I
will
carry
you,
blood
of
my
blood,”
Haggo
offered.

Khal
Drogo
waved
him
away.
“I
need
no
man’s
help,”
he
said,
in
a
voice
proud
and
hard.
He
stood,
unaided,
towering
over
them
all.
A
fresh
wave
of
blood
ran
down
his
breast,
from
where
Ogo’s
arakh
had
cut
off
his
nipple.
Dany
moved
quickly
to
his
side.
“I
am
no
man,”
she
whispered,
“so
you
may
lean
on
me.”
Drogo
put
a
huge
hand
on
her
shoulder.
She
took
some
of
his
weight
as
they
walked
toward
the
great
mud
temple.
The
three
bloodriders
followed.
Dany
commanded
Ser
Jorah
and
the
warriors
of
her
khas
to
guard
the
entrance
and
make
certain
no
one
set
the
building
afire
while
they
were
still
inside.

They
passed
through
a
series
of
anterooms,
into
the
high
central
chamber
under
the
onion.
Faint
light
shone
down
through
hidden
windows
above.
A
few
torches
burnt
smokily
from
sconces
on
the
walls.
Sheepskins
were
scattered
across
the
mud
floor.
“There,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said,
pointing
to
the
altar,
a
massive
blue-veined
stone
carved
with
images
of
shepherds
and
their
flocks.
Khal
Drogo
lay
upon
it.
The
old
woman
threw
a
handful
of
dried
leaves
onto
a
brazier,
filling
the
chamber
with
fragrant
smoke.
“Best
if
you
wait
outside,”
she
told
the
rest
of
them.

“We
are
blood
of
his
blood,”
Cohollo
said.
“Here
we
wait.”

Qotho
stepped
close
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“Know
this,
wife
of
the
Lamb
God.
Harm
the
khal
and
you
suffer
the
same.”
He
drew
his
skinning
knife
and
showed
her
the
blade.

“She
will
do
no
harm.”
Dany
felt
she
could
trust
this
old,
plainfaced
woman
with
her
flat
nose;
she
had
saved
her
from
the
hard
hands
of
her
rapers,
after
all.

“If
you
must
stay,
then
help,”
Mirri
told
the
bloodriders.
“The
Great
Rider
is
too
strong
for
me.
Hold
him
still
while
I
draw
the
arrow
from
his
flesh.”
She
let
the
rags
of
her
gown
fall
to
her
waist
as
she
opened
a
carved
chest,
and
busied
herself
with
bottles
and
boxes,
knives
and
needles.
When
she
was
ready,
she
broke
off
the
barbed
arrowhead
and
pulled
out
the
shaft,
chanting
in
the
singsong
tongue
of
the
Lhazareen.
She
heated
a
flagon
of
wine
to
boiling
on
the
brazier,
and
poured
it
over
his
wounds.
Khal
Drogo
cursed
her,
but
he
did
not
move.
She
bound
the
arrow
wound
with
a
plaster
of
wet
leaves
and
turned
to
the
gash
on
his
breast,
smearing
it
with
a
pale
green
paste
before
she
pulled
the
flap
of
skin
back
in
place.
The
khal
ground
his
teeth
together
and
swallowed
a
scream.
The
godswife
took
out
a
silver
needle
and
a
bobbin
of
silk
thread
and
began
to
close
the
flesh.
When
she
was
done
she
painted
the
skin
with
red
ointment,
covered
it
with
more
leaves,
and
bound
the
breast
in
a
ragged
piece
of
lambskin.
“You
must
say
the
prayers
I
give
you
and
keep
the
lambskin
in
place
for
ten
days
and
ten
nights,”
she
said.
“There
will
be
fever,
and
itching,
and
a
great
scar
when
the
healing
is
done.”

Khal
Drogo
sat,
bells
ringing.
“I
sing
of
my
scars,
sheep
woman.”
He
flexed
his
arm
and
scowled.

“Drink
neither
wine
nor
the
milk
of
the
poppy,”
she
cautioned
him.
“Pain
you
will
have,
but
you
must
keep
your
body
strong
to
fight
the
poison
spirits.”

“I
am
khal,”
Drogo
said.
“I
spit
on
pain
and
drink
what
I
like.
Cohollo,
bring
my
vest.”
The
older
man
hastened
off.

“Before,”
Dany
said
to
the
ugly
Lhazareen
woman,
“I
heard
you
speak
of
birthing
songs…”

“I
know
every
secret
of
the
bloody
bed,
Silver
Lady,
nor
have
I
ever
lost
a
babe,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
replied.

“My
time
is
near,”
Dany
said.
“I
would
have
you
attend
me
when
he
comes,
if
you
would.”

Khal
Drogo
laughed.
“Moon
of
my
life,
you
do
not
ask
a
slave,
you
tell
her.
She
will
do
as
you
command.”
He
jumped
down
from
the
altar.
“Come,
my
blood.
The
stallions
call,
this
place
is
ashes.
It
is
time
to
ride.”

Haggo
followed
the
khal
from
the
temple,
but
Qotho
lingered
long
enough
to
favor
Mirri
Maz
Duur
with
a
stare.
“Remember,
maegi,
as
the
khal
fares,
so
shall
you.”

“As
you
say,
rider,”
the
woman
answered
him,
gathering
up
her
jars
and
bottles.
“The
Great
Shepherd
guards
the
flock.”





TYRION

On
a
hill
overlooking
the
kingsroad,
a
long
trestle
table
of
rough-hewn
pine
had
been
erected
beneath
an
elm
tree
and
covered
with
a
golden
cloth.
There,
beside
his
pavilion,
Lord
Tywin
took
his
evening
meal
with
his
chief
knights
and
lords
bannermen,
his
great
crimson-and-gold
standard
waving
overhead
from
a
lofty
pike.

Tyrion
arrived
late,
saddlesore,
and
sour,
all
too
vividly
aware
of
how
amusing
he
must
look
as
he
waddled
up
the
slope
to
his
father.
The
day’s
march
had
been
long
and
tiring.
He
thought
he
might
get
quite
drunk
tonight.
It
was
twilight,
and
the
air
was
alive
with
drifting
fireflies.

The
cooks
were
serving
the
meat
course:
five
suckling
pigs,
skin
seared
and
crackling,
a
different
fruit
in
every
mouth.
The
smell
made
his
mouth
water.
“My
pardons,”
he
began,
taking
his
place
on
the
bench
beside
his
uncle.

“Perhaps
I’d
best
charge
you
with
burying
our
dead,
Tyrion,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“If
you
are
as
late
to
battle
as
you
are
to
table,
the
fighting
will
all
be
done
by
the
time
you
arrive.”

“Oh,
surely
you
can
save
me
a
peasant
or
two,
Father,”
Tyrion
replied.
“Not
too
many,
I
wouldn’t
want
to
be
greedy.”
He
filled
his
wine
cup
and
watched
a
serving
man
carve
into
the
pig.
The
crisp
skin
crackled
under
his
knife,
and
hot
juice
ran
from
the
meat.
It
was
the
loveliest
sight
Tyrion
had
seen
in
ages.

“Ser
Addam’s
outriders
say
the
Stark
host
has
moved
south
from
the
Twins,”
his
father
reported
as
his
trencher
was
filled
with
slices
of
pork.
“Lord
Frey’s
levies
have
joined
them.
They
are
likely
no
more
than
a
day’s
march
north
of
us.”

“Please,
Father,”
Tyrion
said.
“I’m
about
to
eat.”

“Does
the
thought
of
facing
the
Stark
boy
unman
you,
Tyrion?
Your
brother
Jaime
would
be
eager
to
come
to
grips
with
him.”

“I’d
sooner
come
to
grips
with
that
pig.
Robb
Stark
is
not
half
so
tender,
and
he
never
smelled
as
good.”

Lord
Lefford,
the
sour
bird
who
had
charge
of
their
stores
and
supplies,
leaned
forward.
“I
hope
your
savages
do
not
share
your
reluctance,
else
we’ve
wasted
our
good
steel
on
them.”

“My
savages
will
put
your
steel
to
excellent
use,
my
lord,”
Tyrion
replied.
When
he
had
told
Lefford
he
needed
arms
and
armor
to
equip
the
three
hundred
men
Ulf
had
fetched
down
out
of
the
foothills,
you
would
have
thought
he’d
asked
the
man
to
turn
his
virgin
daughters
over
to
their
pleasure.

Lord
Lefford
frowned.
“I
saw
that
great
hairy
one
today,
the
one
who
insisted
that
he
must
have
two
battle-axes,
the
heavy
black
steel
ones
with
twin
crescent
blades.”

“Shagga
likes
to
kill
with
either
hand,”
Tyrion
said
as
a
trencher
of
steaming
pork
was
laid
in
front
of
him.

“He
still
had
that
wood-axe
of
his
strapped
to
his
back.”

“Shagga
is
of
the
opinion
that
three
axes
are
even
better
than
two.”
Tyrion
reached
a
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
salt
dish,
and
sprinkled
a
healthy
pinch
over
his
meat.

Ser
Kevan
leaned
forward.
“We
had
a
thought
to
put
you
and
your
wildlings
in
the
vanguard
when
we
come
to
battle.”

Ser
Kevan
seldom
“had
a
thought”
that
Lord
Tywin
had
not
had
first.
Tyrion
had
skewered
a
chunk
of
meat
on
the
point
of
his
dagger
and
brought
it
to
his
mouth.
Now
he
lowered
it.
“The
vanguard?”
he
repeated
dubiously.
Either
his
lord
father
had
a
new
respect
for
Tyrion’s
abilities,
or
he’d
decided
to
rid
himself
of
his
embarrassing
get
for
good.
Tyrion
had
the
gloomy
feeling
he
knew
which.

“They
seem
ferocious
enough,”
Ser
Kevan
said.

“Ferocious?”
Tyrion
realized
he
was
echoing
his
uncle
like
a
trained
bird.
His
father
watched,
judging
him,
weighing
every
word.
“Let
me
tell
you
how
ferocious
they
are.
Last
night,
a
Moon
Brother
stabbed
a
Stone
Crow
over
a
sausage.
So
today
as
we
made
camp
three
Stone
Crows
seized
the
man
and
opened
his
throat
for
him.
Perhaps
they
were
hoping
to
get
the
sausage
back,
I
couldn’t
say.
Bronn
managed
to
keep
Shagga
from
chopping
off
the
dead
man’s
cock,
which
was
fortunate,
but
even
so
Ulf
is
demanding
blood
money,
which
Conn
and
Shagga
refuse
to
pay.”

“When
soldiers
lack
discipline,
the
fault
lies
with
their
lord
commander,”
his
father
said.

His
brother
Jaime
had
always
been
able
to
make
men
follow
him
eagerly,
and
die
for
him
if
need
be.
Tyrion
lacked
that
gift.
He
bought
loyalty
with
gold,
and
compelled
obedience
with
his
name.
“A
bigger
man
would
be
able
to
put
the
fear
in
them,
is
that
what
you’re
saying,
my
lord?”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
turned
to
his
brother.
“If
my
son’s
men
will
not
obey
his
commands,
perhaps
the
vanguard
is
not
the
place
for
him.
No
doubt
he
would
be
more
comfortable
in
the
rear,
guarding
our
baggage
train.”

“Do
me
no
kindnesses,
Father,”
he
said
angrily.
“If
you
have
no
other
command
to
offer
me,
I’ll
lead
your
van.”

Lord
Tywin
studied
his
dwarf
son.
“I
said
nothing
about
command.
You
will
serve
under
Ser
Gregor.”

Tyrion
took
one
bite
of
pork,
chewed
a
moment,
and
spit
it
out
angrily.
“I
find
I
am
not
hungry
after
all,”
he
said,
climbing
awkwardly
off
the
bench.
“Pray
excuse
me,
my
lords.”

Lord
Tywin
inclined
his
head,
dismissing
him.
Tyrion
turned
and
walked
away.
He
was
conscious
of
their
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
waddled
down
the
hill.
A
great
gust
of
laughter
went
up
from
behind
him,
but
he
did
not
look
back.
He
hoped
they
all
choked
on
their
suckling
pigs.

Dusk
had
settled,
turning
all
the
banners
black.
The
Lannister
camp
sprawled
for
miles
between
the
river
and
the
kingsroad.
In
amongst
the
men
and
the
horses
and
the
trees,
it
was
easy
to
get
lost,
and
Tyrion
did.
He
passed
a
dozen
great
pavilions
and
a
hundred
cookfires.
Fireflies
drifted
amongst
the
tents
like
wandering
stars.
He
caught
the
scent
of
garlic
sausage,
spiced
and
savory,
so
tempting
it
made
his
empty
stomach
growl.
Away
in
the
distance,
he
heard
voices
raised
in
some
bawdy
song.
A
giggling
woman
raced
past
him,
naked
beneath
a
dark
cloak,
her
drunken
pursuer
stumbling
over
tree
roots.
Farther
on,
two
spearmen
faced
each
other
across
a
little
trickle
of
a
stream,
practicing
their
thrust-and-parry
in
the
fading
light,
their
chests
bare
and
slick
with
sweat.

No
one
looked
at
him.
No
one
spoke
to
him.
No
one
paid
him
any
mind.
He
was
surrounded
by
men
sworn
to
House
Lannister,
a
vast
host
twenty
thousand
strong,
and
yet
he
was
alone.

When
he
heard
the
deep
rumble
of
Shagga’s
laughter
booming
through
the
dark,
he
followed
it
to
the
Stone
Crows
in
their
small
corner
of
the
night.
Conn
son
of
Coratt
waved
a
tankard
of
ale.
“Tyrion
Halfman!
Come,
sit
by
our
fire,
share
meat
with
the
Stone
Crows.
We
have
an
ox.”

“I
can
see
that,
Conn
son
of
Coratt.”
The
huge
red
carcass
was
suspended
over
a
roaring
fire,
skewered
on
a
spit
the
size
of
a
small
tree.
No
doubt
it
was
a
small
tree.
Blood
and
grease
dripped
down
into
the
flames
as
two
Stone
Crows
turned
the
meat.
“I
thank
you.
Send
for
me
when
the
ox
is
cooked.”
From
the
look
of
it,
that
might
even
be
before
the
battle.
He
walked
on.

Each
clan
had
its
own
cookfire;
Black
Ears
did
not
eat
with
Stone
Crows,
Stone
Crows
did
not
eat
with
Moon
Brothers,
and
no
one
ate
with
Burned
Men.
The
modest
tent
he
had
coaxed
out
of
Lord
Lefford’s
stores
had
been
erected
in
the
center
of
the
four
fires.
Tyrion
found
Bronn
sharing
a
skin
of
wine
with
the
new
servants.
Lord
Tywin
had
sent
him
a
groom
and
a
body
servant
to
see
to
his
needs,
and
even
insisted
he
take
a
squire.
They
were
seated
around
the
embers
of
a
small
cookfire.
A
girl
was
with
them;
slim,
dark-haired,
no
more
than
eighteen
by
the
look
of
her.
Tyrion
studied
her
face
for
a
moment,
before
he
spied
fishbones
in
the
ashes.
“What
did
you
eat?”

“Trout,
m’lord,”
said
his
groom.
“Bronn
caught
them.”

Trout,
he
thought.
Suckling
pig.
Damn
my
father.
He
stared
mournfully
at
the
bones,
his
belly
rumbling.

His
squire,
a
boy
with
the
unfortunate
name
of
Podrick
Payne,
swallowed
whatever
he
had
been
about
to
say.
The
lad
was
a
distant
cousin
to
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
the
king’s
headsman…
and
almost
as
quiet,
although
not
for
want
of
a
tongue.
Tyrion
had
made
him
stick
it
out
once,
just
to
be
certain.
“Definitely
a
tongue,”
he
had
said.
“Someday
you
must
learn
to
use
it.”

At
the
moment,
he
did
not
have
the
patience
to
try
and
coax
a
thought
out
of
the
lad,
whom
he
suspected
had
been
inflicted
on
him
as
a
cruel
jape.
Tyrion
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
girl.
“Is
this
her?”
he
asked
Bronn.

She
rose
gracefully
and
looked
down
at
him
from
the
lofty
height
of
five
feet
or
more.
“It
is,
m’lord,
and
she
can
speak
for
herself,
if
it
please
you.”

He
cocked
his
head
to
one
side.
“I
am
Tyrion,
of
House
Lannister.
Men
call
me
the
Imp.”

“My
mother
named
me
Shae.
Men
call
me…
often.”

Bronn
laughed,
and
Tyrion
had
to
smile.
“Into
the
tent,
Shae,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”
He
lifted
the
flap
and
held
it
for
her.
Inside,
he
knelt
to
light
a
candle.

The
life
of
a
soldier
was
not
without
certain
compensations.
Wherever
you
have
a
camp,
you
are
certain
to
have
camp
followers.
At
the
end
of
the
day’s
march,
Tyrion
had
sent
Bronn
back
to
find
him
a
likely
whore.
“I
would
prefer
one
who
is
reasonably
young,
with
as
pretty
a
face
as
you
can
find,”
he
had
said.
“If
she
has
washed
sometime
this
year,
I
shall
be
glad.
If
she
hasn’t,
wash
her.
Be
certain
that
you
tell
her
who
I
am,
and
warn
her
of
what
I
am.”
Jyck
had
not
always
troubled
to
do
that.
There
was
a
look
the
girls
got
in
their
eyes
sometimes
when
they
first
beheld
the
lordling
they’d
been
hired
to
pleasure…
a
took
that
Tyrion
Lannister
did
not
ever
care
to
see
again.

He
lifted
the
candle
and
looked
her
over.
Bronn
had
done
well
enough;
she
was
doe-eyed
and
slim,
with
small
firm
breasts
and
a
smile
that
was
by
turns
shy,
insolent,
and
wicked.
He
liked
that.
“Shall
I
take
my
gown
off,
m’lord?”
she
asked.

“In
good
time.
Are
you
a
maiden,
Shae?”

“If
it
please
you,
m’lord,”
she
said
demurely.

“What
would
please
me
would
be
the
truth
of
you,
girl.”

“Aye,
but
that
will
cost
you
double.”

Tyrion
decided
they
would
get
along
splendidly.
“I
am
a
Lannister.
Gold
I
have
in
plenty,
and
you’ll
find
me
generous…
but
I’ll
want
more
from
you
than
what
you’ve
got
between
your
legs,
though
I’ll
want
that
too.
You’ll
share
my
tent,
pour
my
wine,
laugh
at
my
jests,
rub
the
ache
from
my
legs
after
each
day’s
ride…
and
whether
I
keep
you
a
day
or
a
year,
for
so
long
as
we
are
together
you
will
take
no
other
men
into
your
bed.”

“Fair
enough.”
She
reached
down
to
the
hem
of
her
thin
roughspun
gown
and
pulled
it
up
over
her
head
in
one
smooth
motion,
tossing
it
aside.
There
was
nothing
underneath
but
Shae.
“If
he
don’t
put
down
that
candle,
m’lord
will
burn
his
fingers.”

Tyrion
put
down
the
candle,
took
her
hand
in
his,
and
pulled
her
gently
to
him.
She
bent
to
kiss
him.
Her
mouth
tasted
of
honey
and
cloves,
and
her
fingers
were
deft
and
practiced
as
they
found
the
fastenings
of
his
clothes.

When
he
entered
her,
she
welcomed
him
with
whispered
endearments
and
small,
shuddering
gasps
of
pleasure.
Tyrion
suspected
her
delight
was
feigned,
but
she
did
it
so
well
that
it
did
not
matter.
That
much
truth
he
did
not
crave.

He
had
needed
her,
Tyrion
realized
afterward,
as
she
lay
quietly
in
his
arms.
Her
or
someone
like
her.
It
had
been
nigh
on
a
year
since
he’d
lain
with
a
woman,
since
before
he
had
set
out
for
Winterfell
in
company
with
his
brother
and
King
Robert.
He
could
well
die
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after,
and
if
he
did,
he
would
sooner
go
to
his
grave
thinking
of
Shae
than
of
his
lord
father,
Lysa
Arryn,
or
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.

He
could
feel
the
softness
of
her
breasts
pressed
against
his
arm
as
she
lay
beside
him.
That
was
a
good
feeling.
A
song
filled
his
head.
Softly,
quietly,
he
began
to
whistle.

“What’s
that,
m’lord?”
Shae
murmured
against
him.

“Nothing,”
he
told
her.
“A
song
I
learned
as
a
boy,
that’s
all.
Go
to
sleep,
sweetling.”

When
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
breathing
deep
and
steady,
Tyrion
slid
out
from
beneath
her,
gently,
so
as
not
to
disturb
her
sleep.
Naked,
he
crawled
outside,
stepped
over
his
squire,
and
walked
around
behind
his
tent
to
make
water.

Bronn
was
seated
cross-legged
under
a
chestnut
tree,
near
where
they’d
tied
the
horses.
He
was
honing
the
edge
of
his
sword,
wide
awake;
the
sellsword
did
not
seem
to
sleep
like
other
men.
“Where
did
you
find
her?”
Tyrion
asked
him
as
he
pissed.

“I
took
her
from
a
knight.
The
man
was
loath
to
give
her
up,
but
your
name
changed
his
thinking
somewhat…
that,
and
my
dirk
at
his
throat.”

“Splendid,”
Tyrion
said
dryly,
shaking
off
the
last
drops.
“I
seem
to
recall
saying
find
me
a
whore,
not
make
me
an
enemy.”

“The
pretty
ones
were
all
claimed,”
Bronn
said.
“I’ll
be
pleased
to
take
her
back
if
you’d
prefer
a
toothless
drab.”

Tyrion
limped
closer
to
where
he
sat.
“My
lord
father
would
call
that
insolence,
and
send
you
to
the
mines
for
impertinence.”

“Good
for
me
you’re
not
your
father,”
Bronn
replied.
“I
saw
one
with
boils
all
over
her
nose.
Would
you
like
her?”

“What,
and
break
your
heart?”
Tyrion
shot
back.
“I
shall
keep
Shae.
Did
you
perchance
note
the
name
of
this
knight
you
took
her
from?
I’d
rather
not
have
him
beside
me
in
the
battle.”

Bronn
rose,
cat-quick
and
cat-graceful,
turning
his
sword
in
his
hand.
“You’ll
have
me
beside
you
in
the
battle,
dwarf.”

Tyrion
nodded.
The
night
air
was
warm
on
his
bare
skin.
“See
that
I
survive
this
battle,
and
you
can
name
your
reward.”

Bronn
tossed
the
longsword
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left,
and
tried
a
cut.
“Who’d
want
to
kill
the
likes
of
you?”

“My
lord
father,
for
one.
He’s
put
me
in
the
van.”

“I’d
do
the
same.
A
small
man
with
a
big
shield.
You’ll
give
the
archers
fits.”

“I
find
you
oddly
cheering,”
Tyrion
said.
“I
must
be
mad.”

Bronn
sheathed
his
sword.
“Beyond
a
doubt.”

When
Tyrion
returned
to
his
tent,
Shae
rolled
onto
her
elbow
and
murmured
sleepily,
“I
woke
and
m’lord
was
gone.”

“M’lord
is
back
now.”
He
slid
in
beside
her.

Her
hand
went
between
his
stunted
legs,
and
found
him
hard.
“Yes
he
is,”
she
whispered,
stroking
him.

He
asked
her
about
the
man
Bronn
had
taken
her
from,
and
she
named
the
minor
retainer
of
an
insignificant
lordling.
“You
need
not
fear
his
like,
m’lord,”
the
girl
said,
her
fingers
busy
at
his
cock.
“He
is
a
small
man.”

“And
what
am
I,
pray?”
Tyrion
asked
her.
“A
giant?”

“Oh,
yes,”
she
purred,
“my
giant
of
Lannister.”
She
mounted
him
then,
and
for
a
time,
she
almost
made
him
believe
it.
Tyrion
went
to
sleep
smiling…

…
and
woke
in
darkness
to
the
blare
of
trumpets.
Shae
was
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder.
“M’lord,”
she
whispered.
“Wake
up,
m’lord.
I’m
frightened.”

Groggy,
he
sat
up
and
threw
back
the
blanket.
The
horns
called
through
the
night,
wild
and
urgent,
a
cry
that
said
hurry
hurry
hurry.
He
heard
shouts,
the
clatter
of
spears,
the
whicker
of
horses,
though
nothing
yet
that
spoke
to
him
of
fighting.
“My
lord
father’s
trumpets,”
he
said.
“Battle
assembly.
I
thought
Stark
was
yet
a
day’s
march
away.”

Shae
shook
her
head,
lost.
Her
eyes
were
wide
and
white.

Groaning,
Tyrion
lurched
to
his
feet
and
pushed
his
way
outside,
shouting
for
his
squire.
Wisps
of
pale
fog
drifted
through
the
night,
long
white
fingers
off
the
river.
Men
and
horses
blundered
through
the
predawn
chill;
saddles
were
being
cinched,
wagons
loaded,
fires
extinguished.
The
trumpets
blew
again:
hurry
hurry
hurry.
Knights
vaulted
onto
snorting
coursers
while
men-at-arms
buckled
their
sword
belts
as
they
ran.
When
he
found
Pod,
the
boy
was
snoring
softly.
Tyrion
gave
him
a
sharp
poke
in
the
ribs
with
his
toe.
“My
armor,”
he
said,
“and
be
quick
about
it.”
Bronn
came
trotting
out
of
the
mists,
already
armored
and
ahorse,
wearing
his
battered
halfhelm.
“Do
you
know
what’s
happened?”
Tyrion
asked
him.

“The
Stark
boy
stole
a
march
on
us,”
Bronn
said.
“He
crept
down
the
kingsroad
in
the
night,
and
now
his
host
is
less
than
a
mile
north
of
here,
forming
up
in
battle
array.”

Hurry,
the
trumpets
called,
hurry
hurry
hurry.

“See
that
the
clansmen
are
ready
to
ride.”
Tyrion
ducked
back
inside
his
tent.
“Where
are
my
clothes?”
he
barked
at
Shae.
“There.
No,
the
leather,
damn
it.
Yes.
Bring
me
my
boots.”

By
the
time
he
was
dressed,
his
squire
had
laid
out
his
armor,
such
that
it
was.
Tyrion
owned
a
fine
suit
of
heavy
plate,
expertly
crafted
to
fit
his
misshapen
body.
Alas,
it
was
safe
at
Casterly
Rock,
and
he
was
not.
He
had
to
make
do
with
oddments
assembled
from
Lord
Lefford’s
wagons:
mail
hauberk
and
coif,
a
dead
knight’s
gorget,
lobstered
greaves
and
gauntlets
and
pointed
steel
boots.
Some
of
it
was
ornate,
some
plain;
not
a
bit
of
it
matched,
or
fit
as
it
should.
His
breastplate
was
meant
for
a
bigger
man;
for
his
oversize
head,
they
found
a
huge
bucket-shaped
greathelm
topped
with
a
foot-long
triangular
spike.

Shae
helped
Pod
with
the
buckles
and
clasps.
“If
I
die,
weep
for
me,”
Tyrion
told
the
whore.

“How
will
you
know?
You’ll
be
dead.”

“I’ll
know.”

“I
believe
you
would.”
Shae
lowered
the
greathelm
down
over
his
head,
and
Pod
fastened
it
to
his
gorget.
Tyrion
buckled
on
his
belt,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
shortsword
and
dirk.
By
then
his
groom
had
brought
up
his
mount,
a
formidable
brown
courser
armored
as
heavily
as
he
was.
He
needed
help
to
mount;
he
felt
as
though
he
weighed
a
thousand
stone.
Pod
handed
him
up
his
shield,
a
massive
slab
of
heavy
ironwood
banded
with
steel.
Lastly
they
gave
him
his
battle-axe.
Shae
stepped
back
and
looked
him
over.
“M’lord
looks
fearsome.”

“M’lord
looks
a
dwarf
in
mismatched
armor,”
Tyrion
answered
sourly,
“but
I
thank
you
for
the
kindness.
Podrick,
should
the
battle
go
against
us,
see
the
lady
safely
home.”
He
saluted
her
with
his
axe,
wheeled
his
horse
about,
and
trotted
off.
His
stomach
was
a
hard
knot,
so
tight
it
pained
him.
Behind,
his
servants
hurriedly
began
to
strike
his
tent.
Pale
crimson
fingers
fanned
out
to
the
east
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
broke
over
the
horizon.
The
western
sky
was
a
deep
purple,
speckled
with
stars.
Tyrion
wondered
whether
this
was
the
last
sunrise
he
would
ever
see…
and
whether
wondering
was
a
mark
of
cowardice.
Did
his
brother
Jaime
ever
contemplate
death
before
a
battle?

A
warhorn
sounded
in
the
far
distance,
a
deep
mournful
note
that
chilled
the
soul.
The
clansmen
climbed
onto
their
scrawny
mountain
horses,
shouting
curses
and
rude
jokes.
Several
appeared
to
be
drunk.
The
rising
sun
was
burning
off
the
drifting
tendrils
of
fog
as
Tyrion
led
them
off.
What
grass
the
horses
had
left
was
heavy
with
dew,
as
if
some
passing
god
had
scattered
a
bag
of
diamonds
over
the
earth.
The
mountain
men
fell
in
behind
him,
each
clan
arrayed
behind
its
own
leaders.

In
the
dawn
light,
the
army
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
unfolded
like
an
iron
rose,
thorns
gleaming.

His
uncle
would
lead
the
center.
Ser
Kevan
had
raised
his
standards
above
the
kingsroad.
Quivers
hanging
from
their
belts,
the
foot
archers
arrayed
themselves
into
three
long
lines,
to
east
and
west
of
the
road,
and
stood
calmly
stringing
their
bows.
Between
them,
pikemen
formed
squares;
behind
were
rank
on
rank
of
men-at-arms
with
spear
and
sword
and
axe.
Three
hundred
heavy
horse
surrounded
Ser
Kevan
and
the
lords
bannermen
Lefford,
Lydden,
and
Serrett
with
all
their
sworn
retainers.

The
right
wing
was
all
cavalry,
some
four
thousand
men,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
their
armor.
More
than
three
quarters
of
the
knights
were
there,
massed
together
like
a
great
steel
fist.
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
had
the
command.
Tyrion
saw
his
banner
unfurl
as
his
standardbearer
shook
it
out;
a
burning
tree,
orange
and
smoke.
Behind
him
flew
Ser
Flement’s
purple
unicorn,
the
brindled
boar
of
Crakehall,
the
bantam
rooster
of
Swyft,
and
more.

His
lord
father
took
his
place
on
the
hill
where
he
had
slept.
Around
him,
the
reserve
assembled;
a
huge
force,
half
mounted
and
half
foot,
five
thousand
strong.
Lord
Tywin
almost
always
chose
to
command
the
reserve;
he
would
take
the
high
ground
and
watch
the
battle
unfold
below
him,
committing
his
forces
when
and
where
they
were
needed
most.

Even
from
afar,
his
lord
father
was
resplendent.
Tywin
Lannister’s
battle
armor
put
his
son
Jaime’s
gilded
suit
to
shame.
His
greatcloak
was
sewn
from
countless
layers
of
cloth-of-gold,
so
heavy
that
it
barely
stirred
even
when
he
charged,
so
large
that
its
drape
covered
most
of
his
stallion’s
hindquarters
when
he
took
the
saddle.
No
ordinary
clasp
would
suffice
for
such
a
weight,
so
the
greatcloak
was
held
in
place
by
a
matched
pair
of
miniature
lionesses
crouching
on
his
shoulders,
as
if
poised
to
spring.
Their
mate,
a
male
with
a
magnificent
mane,
reclined
atop
Lord
Tywin’s
greathelm,
one
paw
raking
the
air
as
he
roared.
All
three
lions
were
wrought
in
gold,
with
ruby
eyes.
His
armor
was
heavy
steel
plate,
enameled
in
a
dark
crimson,
greaves
and
gauntlets
inlaid
with
ornate
gold
scrollwork.
His
rondels
were
golden
sunbursts,
all
his
fastenings
were
gilded,
and
the
red
steel
was
burnished
to
such
a
high
sheen
that
it
shone
like
fire
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun.

Tyrion
could
hear
the
rumble
of
the
foemen’s
drums
now.
He
remembered
Robb
Stark
as
he
had
last
seen
him,
in
his
father’s
high
seat
in
the
Great
Hall
of
Winterfell,
a
sword
naked
and
shining
in
his
hands.
He
remembered
how
the
direwolves
had
come
at
him
out
of
the
shadows,
and
suddenly
he
could
see
them
again,
snarling
and
snapping,
teeth
bared
in
his
face.
Would
the
boy
bring
his
wolves
to
war
with
him?
The
thought
made
him
uneasy.

The
northerners
would
be
exhausted
after
their
long
sleepless
march.
Tyrion
wondered
what
the
boy
had
been
thinking.
Did
he
think
to
take
them
unawares
while
they
slept?
Small
chance
of
that;
whatever
else
might
be
said
of
him,
Tywin
Lannister
was
no
man’s
fool.

The
van
was
massing
on
the
left.
He
saw
the
standard
first,
three
black
dogs
on
a
yellow
field.
Ser
Gregor
sat
beneath
it,
mounted
on
the
biggest
horse
Tyrion
had
ever
seen.
Bronn
took
one
look
at
him
and
grinned.
“Always
follow
a
big
man
into
battle.”

Tyrion
threw
him
a
hard
look.
“And
why
is
that?”

“They
make
such
splendid
targets.
That
one,
he’ll
draw
the
eyes
of
every
bowman
on
the
field.”

Laughing,
Tyrion
regarded
the
Mountain
with
fresh
eyes.
“I
confess,
I
had
not
considered
it
in
that
light.”

Clegane
had
no
splendor
about
him;
his
armor
was
steel
plate,
dull
grey,
scarred
by
hard
use
and
showing
neither
sigil
nor
ornament.
He
was
pointing
men
into
position
with
his
blade,
a
two-handed
greatsword
that
Ser
Gregor
waved
about
with
one
hand
as
a
lesser
man
might
wave
a
dagger.
“Any
man
runs,
I’ll
cut
him
down
myself,”
he
was
roaring
when
he
caught
sight
of
Tyrion.
“Imp!
Take
the
left.
Hold
the
river.
If
you
can.”

The
left
of
the
left.
To
turn
their
flank,
the
Starks
would
need
horses
that
could
run
on
water.
Tyrion
led
his
men
toward
the
riverbank.
“Look,”
he
shouted,
pointing
with
his
axe.
“The
river.”
A
blanket
of
pale
mist
still
clung
to
the
surface
of
the
water,
the
murky
green
current
swirling
past
underneath.
The
shallows
were
muddy
and
choked
with
reeds.
“That
river
is
ours.
Whatever
happens,
keep
close
to
the
water.
Never
lose
sight
of
it.
Let
no
enemy
come
between
us
and
our
river.
If
they
dirty
our
waters,
hack
off
their
cocks
and
feed
them
to
the
fishes.”

Shagga
had
an
axe
in
either
hand.
He
smashed
them
together
and
made
them
ring.
“Halfman!”
he
shouted.
Other
Stone
Crows
picked
up
the
cry,
and
the
Black
Ears
and
Moon
Brothers
as
well.
The
Burned
Men
did
not
shout,
but
they
rattled
their
swords
and
spears.
“Halfman!
Halfman!
Halfman!”

Tyrion
turned
his
courser
in
a
circle
to
look
over
the
field.
The
ground
was
rolling
and
uneven
here;
soft
and
muddy
near
the
river,
rising
in
a
gentle
slope
toward
the
kingsroad,
stony
and
broken
beyond
it,
to
the
cast.
A
few
trees
spotted
the
hillsides,
but
most
of
the
land
had
been
cleared
and
planted.
His
heart
pounded
in
his
chest
in
time
to
the
drums,
and
under
his
layers
of
leather
and
steel
his
brow
was
cold
with
sweat.
He
watched
Ser
Gregor
as
the
Mountain
rode
up
and
down
the
line,
shouting
and
gesticulating.
This
wing
too
was
all
cavalry,
but
where
the
right
was
a
mailed
fist
of
knights
and
heavy
lancers,
the
vanguard
was
made
up
of
the
sweepings
of
the
west:
mounted
archers
in
leather
jerkins,
a
swarming
mass
of
undisciplined
freeriders
and
sellswords,
fieldhands
on
plow
horses
armed
with
scythes
and
their
fathers’
rusted
swords,
half-trained
boys
from
the
stews
of
Lannisport…
and
Tyrion
and
his
mountain
clansmen.

“Crow
food,”
Bronn
muttered
beside
him,
giving
voice
to
what
Tyrion
had
left
unsaid.
He
could
only
nod.
Had
his
lord
father
taken
leave
of
his
senses?
No
pikes,
too
few
bowmen,
a
bare
handful
of
knights,
the
ill-armed
and
unarmored,
commanded
by
an
unthinking
brute
who
led
with
his
rage…
how
could
his
father
expect
this
travesty
of
a
battle
to
hold
his
left?

He
had
no
time
to
think
about
it.
The
drums
were
so
near
that
the
beat
crept
under
his
skin
and
set
his
hands
to
twitching.
Bronn
drew
his
longsword,
and
suddenly
the
enemy
was
there
before
them,
boiling
over
the
tops
of
the
hills,
advancing
with
measured
tread
behind
a
wall
of
shields
and
pikes.

Gods
be
damned,
look
at
them
all,
Tyrion
thought,
though
he
knew
his
father
had
more
men
on
the
field.
Their
captains
led
them
on
armored
warhorses,
standard-bearers
riding
alongside
with
their
banners.
He
glimpsed
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods,
the
Karstark
sunburst,
Lord
Cerwyn’s
battle-axe,
and
the
mailed
fist
of
the
Glovers…
and
the
twin
towers
of
Frey,
blue
on
grey.
So
much
for
his
father’s
certainty
that
Lord
Walder
would
not
bestir
himself.
The
white
of
House
Stark
was
seen
everywhere,
the
grey
direwolves
seeming
to
run
and
leap
as
the
banners
swirled
and
streamed
from
the
high
staffs.
Where
is
the
boy?
Tyrion
wondered.

A
warhorn
blew.
Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo,
it
cried,
its
voice
as
long
and
low
and
chilling
as
a
cold
wind
from
the
north.
The
Lannister
trumpets
answered,
da-DA
da-DA
da-DAAAAAAAAA,
brazen
and
defiant,
yet
it
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
they
sounded
somehow
smaller,
more
anxious.
He
could
feel
a
fluttering
in
his
bowels,
a
queasy
liquid
feeling;
he
hoped
he
was
not
going
to
die
sick.

As
the
horns
died
away,
a
hissing
filled
the
air;
a
vast
flight
of
arrows
arched
up
from
his
right,
where
the
archers
stood
flanking
the
road.
The
northerners
broke
into
a
run,
shouting
as
they
came,
but
the
Lannister
arrows
fell
on
them
like
hail,
hundreds
of
arrows,
thousands,
and
shouts
turned
to
screams
as
men
stumbled
and
went
down.
By
then
a
second
flight
was
in
the
air,
and
the
archers
were
fitting
a
third
arrow
to
their
bowstrings.

The
trumpets
blared
again,
da-DAAA
da-DAAA
da-DA
da-DA
da-DAAAAAAA.
Ser
Gregor
waved
his
huge
sword
and
bellowed
a
command,
and
a
thousand
other
voices
screamed
back
at
him.
Tyrion
put
his
spurs
to
his
horse
and
added
one
more
voice
to
the
cacophony,
and
the
van
surged
forward.
“The
river!”
he
shouted
at
his
clansmen
as
they
rode.
“Remember,
hew
to
the
river.”
He
was
still
leading
when
they
broke
a
canter,
until
Chella
gave
a
bloodcurdling
shriek
and
galloped
past
him,
and
Shagga
howled
and
followed.
The
clansmen
charged
after
them,
leaving
Tyrion
in
their
dust.

A
crescent
of
enemy
spearmen
had
formed
ahead,
a
double
hedgehog
bristling
with
steel,
waiting
behind
tall
oaken
shields
marked
with
the
sunburst
of
Karstark.
Gregor
Clegane
was
the
first
to
reach
them,
leading
a
wedge
of
armored
veterans.
Half
the
horses
shied
at
the
last
second,
breaking
their
charge
before
the
row
of
spears.
The
others
died,
sharp
steel
points
ripping
through
their
chests.
Tyrion
saw
a
dozen
men
go
down.
The
Mountain’s
stallion
reared,
lashing
out
with
iron-shod
hooves
as
a
barbed
spearhead
raked
across
his
neck.
Maddened,
the
beast
lunged
into
the
ranks.
Spears
thrust
at
him
from
every
side,
but
the
shield
wall
broke
beneath
his
weight.
The
northerners
stumbled
away
from
the
animal’s
death
throes.
As
his
horse
fell,
snorting
blood
and
biting
with
his
last
red
breath,
the
Mountain
rose
untouched,
laying
about
him
with
his
two-handed
greatsword.

Shagga
went
bursting
through
the
gap
before
the
shields
could
close,
other
Stone
Crows
hard
behind
him.
Tyrion
shouted,
“Burned
Men!
Moon
Brothers!
After
me!”
but
most
of
them
were
ahead
of
him.
He
glimpsed
Timett
son
of
Timett
vault
free
as
his
mount
died
under
him
in
full
stride,
saw
a
Moon
Brother
impaled
on
a
Karstark
spear,
watched
Conn’s
horse
shatter
a
man’s
ribs
with
a
kick.
A
flight
of
arrows
descended
on
them;
where
they
came
from
he
could
not
say,
but
they
fell
on
Stark
and
Lannister
alike,
rattling
off
armor
or
finding
flesh.
Tyrion
lifted
his
shield
and
hid
beneath
it.

The
hedgehog
was
crumbling,
the
northerners
reeling
back
under
the
impact
of
the
mounted
assault.
Tyrion
saw
Shagga
catch
a
spearman
full
in
the
chest
as
the
fool
came
on
at
a
run,
saw
his
axe
shear
through
mail
and
leather
and
muscle
and
lungs.
The
man
was
dead
on
his
feet,
the
axehead
lodged
in
his
breast,
yet
Shagga
rode
on,
cleaving
a
shield
in
two
with
his
left-hand
battle-axe
while
the
corpse
was
bouncing
and
stumbling
bonelessly
along
on
his
right.
Finally
the
dead
man
slid
off.
Shagga
smashed
the
two
axes
together
and
roared.

By
then
the
enemy
was
on
him,
and
Tyrion’s
battle
shrunk
to
the
few
feet
of
ground
around
his
horse.
A
man-at-arms
thrust
at
his
chest
and
his
axe
lashed
out,
knocking
the
spear
aside.
The
man
danced
back
for
another
try,
but
Tyrion
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
right
over
him.
Bronn
was
surrounded
by
three
foes,
but
he
lopped
the
head
off
the
first
spear
that
came
at
him,
and
raked
his
blade
across
a
second
man’s
face
on
his
backslash.

A
thrown
spear
came
hurtling
at
Tyrion
from
the
left
and
lodged
in
his
shield
with
a
woody
chunk.
He
wheeled
and
raced
after
the
thrower,
but
the
man
raised
his
own
shield
over
his
head.
Tyrion
circled
around
him,
raining
axe
blows
down
on
the
wood.
Chips
of
oak
went
flying,
until
the
northerner
lost
his
feet
and
slipped,
failing
flat
on
his
back
with
his
shield
on
top
of
him.
He
was
below
the
reach
of
Tyrion’s
axe
and
it
was
too
much
bother
to
dismount,
so
he
left
him
there
and
rode
after
another
man,
taking
him
from
behind
with
a
sweeping
downcut
that
sent
a
jolt
of
impact
up
his
arm.
That
won
him
a
moment’s
respite.
Reining
up,
he
looked
for
the
river.
There
it
was,
off
to
the
right.
Somehow
he
had
gotten
turned
around.

A
Burned
Man
rode
past,
slumped
against
his
horse.
A
spear
had
entered
his
belly
and
come
out
through
his
back.
He
was
past
any
help,
but
when
Tyrion
saw
one
of
the
northerners
run
up
and
make
a
grab
for
his
reins,
he
charged.

His
quarry
met
him
sword
in
hand.
He
was
tall
and
spare,
wearing
a
long
chainmail
hauberk
and
gauntlets
of
lobstered
steel,
but
he’d
lost
his
helm
and
blood
ran
down
into
his
eyes
from
a
gash
across
his
forehead.
Tyrion
aimed
a
swipe
at
his
face,
but
the
tall
man
slammed
it
aside.
“Dwarf,”
he
screamed.
“Die.”
He
turned
in
a
circle
as
Tyrion
rode
around
him,
hacking
at
his
head
and
shoulders.
Steel
rang
on
steel,
and
Tyrion
soon
realized
that
the
tall
man
was
quicker
and
stronger
than
he
was.
Where
in
the
seven
hells
was
Bronn?
“Die,”
the
man
grunted,
chopping
at
him
savagely.
Tyrion
barely
got
his
shield
up
in
time,
and
the
wood
seemed
to
explode
inward
under
the
force
of
the
blow.
The
shattered
pieces
fell
away
from
his
arm.
“Die!”
the
swordsman
bellowed,
shoving
in
close
and
whanging
Tyrion
across
the
temple
so
hard
his
head
rang.
The
blade
made
a
hideous
scraping
sound
as
he
drew
it
back
over
the
steel.
The
tall
man
grinned…
until
Tyrion’s
destrier
bit,
quick
as
a
snake,
laying
his
cheek
bare
to
the
bone.
Then
he
screamed.
Tyrion
buried
his
axe
in
his
head.
“You
die,”
he
told
him,
and
he
did.

As
he
wrenched
the
blade
free,
he
heard
a
shout.
‘Eddard!”
a
voice
rang
out.
“For
Eddard
and
Winterfell!”
The
knight
came
thundering
down
on
him,
swinging
the
spiked
ball
of
a
morningstar
around
his
head.
Their
warhorses
slammed
together
before
Tyrion
could
so
much
as
open
his
mouth
to
shout
for
Bronn.
His
right
elbow
exploded
with
pain
as
the
spikes
punched
through
the
thin
metal
around
the
joint.
His
axe
was
gone,
as
fast
as
that.
He
clawed
for
his
sword,
but
the
morningstar
was
circling
again,
coming
at
his
face.
A
sickening
crunch,
and
he
was
falling.
He
did
not
recall
hitting
the
ground,
but
when
he
looked
up
there
was
only
sky
above
him.
He
rolled
onto
his
side
and
tried
to
find
his
feet,
but
pain
shuddered
through
him
and
the
world
throbbed.
The
knight
who
had
felled
him
drew
up
above
him.
“Tyrion
the
Imp,”
he
boomed
down.
“You
are
mine.
Do
you
yield,
Lannister?”

Yes,
Tyrion
thought,
but
the
word
caught
in
his
throat.
He
made
a
croaking
sound
and
fought
his
way
to
his
knees,
fumbling
for
a
weapon.
His
sword,
his
dirk,
anything…

“Do
you
yield?”
The
knight
loomed
overhead
on
his
armored
warhorse.
Man
and
horse
both
seemed
immense.
The
spiked
ball
swung
in
a
lazy
circle.
Tyrion’s
hands
were
numb,
his
vision
blurred,
his
scabbard
empty.
“Yield
or
die,”
the
knight
declared,
his
flail
whirling
faster
and
faster.

Tyrion
lurched
to
his
feet,
driving
his
head
into
the
horse’s
belly.
The
animal
gave
a
hideous
scream
and
reared.
It
tried
to
twist
away
from
the
agony,
a
shower
of
blood
and
viscera
poured
down
over
Tyrion’s
face,
and
the
horse
fell
like
an
avalanche.
The
next
he
knew,
his
visor
was
packed
with
mud
and
something
was
crushing
his
foot.
He
wriggled
free,
his
throat
so
tight
he
could
scarce
talk.
“…yield…”
he
managed
to
croak
faintly.

“Yes,”
a
voice
moaned,
thick
with
pain.

Tyrion
scraped
the
mud
off
his
helm
so
he
could
see
again.
The
horse
had
fallen
away
from
him,
onto
its
rider.
The
knight’s
leg
was
trapped,
the
arm
he’d
used
to
break
his
fall
twisted
at
a
grotesque
angle.
“Yield,”
he
repeated.
Fumbling
at
his
belt
with
his
good
hand,
he
drew
a
sword
and
flung
it
at
Tyrion’s
feet.
“I
yield,
my
lord.”

Dazed,
the
dwarf
knelt
and
lifted
the
blade.
Pain
hammered
through
his
elbow
when
he
moved
his
arm.
The
battle
seemed
to
have
moved
beyond
him.
No
one
remained
on
his
part
of
the
field
save
a
large
number
of
corpses.
Ravens
were
already
circling
and
landing
to
feed.
He
saw
that
Ser
Kevan
had
brought
up
his
center
in
support
of
the
van;
his
huge
mass
of
pikemen
had
pushed
the
northerners
back
against
the
hills.
They
were
struggling
on
the
slopes,
pikes
thrusting
against
another
wall
of
shields,
these
oval
and
reinforced
with
iron
studs.
As
he
watched,
the
air
filled
with
arrows
again,
and
the
men
behind
the
oak
wall
crumbled
beneath
the
murderous
fire.
“I
believe
you
are
losing,
ser,”
he
told
the
knight
under
the
horse.
The
man
made
no
reply.

The
sound
of
hooves
coming
up
behind
him
made
him
whirl,
though
he
could
scarcely
lift
the
sword
he
held
for
the
agony
in
his
elbow.
Brorm
reined
up
and
looked
down
on
him.

“Small
use
you
turned
out
to
be,”
Tyrion
told
him.

“It
would
seem
you
did
well
enough
on
your
own,”
Bronn
answered.
“You’ve
lost
the
spike
off
your
helm,
though.”

Tyrion
groped
at
the
top
of
the
greathelm.
The
spike
had
snapped
off
clean.
“I
haven’t
lost
it.
I
know
just
where
it
is.
Do
you
see
my
horse?”

By
the
time
they
found
it,
the
trumpets
had
sounded
again
and
Lord
Tywin’s
reserve
came
sweeping
up
along
the
river.
Tyrion
watched
his
father
fly
past,
the
crimson-and-gold
banner
of
Lannister
rippling
over
his
head
as
he
thundered
across
the
field.
Five
hundred
knights
surrounded
him,
sunlight
flashing
off
the
points
of
their
lances.
The
remnants
of
the
Stark
lines
shattered
like
glass
beneath
the
hammer
of
their
charge.

With
his
elbow
swollen
and
throbbing
inside
his
armor,
Tyrion
made
no
attempt
to
join
the
slaughter.
He
and
Bronn
went
looking
for
his
men.
Many
he
found
among
the
dead.
Ulf
son
of
Umar
lay
in
a
pool
of
congealing
blood,
his
arm
gone
at
the
elbow,
a
dozen
of
his
Moon
Brothers
sprawled
around
him.
Shagga
was
slumped
beneath
a
tree,
riddled
with
arrows,
Conn’s
head
in
his
lap.
Tyrion
thought
they
were
both
dead,
but
as
he
dismounted,
Shagga
opened
his
eyes
and
said,
“They
have
killed
Conn
son
of
Coratt.”
Handsome
Conn
had
no
mark
but
for
the
red
stain
over
his
breast,
where
the
spear
thrust
had
killed
him.
When
Bronn
pulled
Shagga
to
his
feet,
the
big
man
seemed
to
notice
the
arrows
for
the
first
time.
He
plucked
them
out
one
by
one,
cursing
the
holes
they
had
made
in
his
layers
of
mail
and
leather,
and
yowling
like
a
babe
at
the
few
that
had
buried
themselves
in
his
flesh.
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
rode
up
as
they
were
yanking
arrows
out
of
Shagga,
and
showed
them
four
ears
she
had
taken.
Timett
they
discovered
looting
the
bodies
of
the
slain
with
his
Burned
Men.
Of
the
three
hundred
clansmen
who
had
ridden
to
battle
behind
Tyrion
Lannister,
perhaps
half
had
survived.

He
left
the
living
to
look
after
the
dead,
sent
Bronn
to
take
charge
of
his
captive
knight,
and
went
alone
in
search
of
his
father.
Lord
Tywin
was
seated
by
the
river,
sipping
wine
from
a
jeweled
cup
as
his
squire
undid
the
fastenings
on
his
breastplate.
“A
fine
victory,”
Ser
Kevan
said
when
he
saw
Tyrion.
“Your
wild
men
fought
well.”

His
father’s
eyes
were
on
him,
pale
green
flecked
with
gold,
so
cool
they
gave
Tyrion
a
chill.
“Did
that
surprise
you,
Father?”
he
asked.
“Did
it
upset
your
plans?
We
were
supposed
to
be
butchered,
were
we
not?”

Lord
Tywin
drained
his
cup,
his
face
expressionless.
“I
put
the
least
disciplined
men
on
the
left,
yes.
I
anticipated
that
they
would
break.
Robb
Stark
is
a
green
boy,
more
like
to
be
brave
than
wise.
I’d
hoped
that
if
he
saw
our
left
collapse,
he
might
plunge
into
the
gap,
eager
for
a
rout.
Once
he
was
fully
committed,
Ser
Kevan’s
pikes
would
wheel
and
take
him
in
the
flank,
driving
him
into
the
river
while
I
brought
up
the
reserve.”

“And
you
thought
it
best
to
place
me
in
the
midst
of
this
carnage,
yet
keep
me
ignorant
of
your
plans.”

“A
feigned
rout
is
less
convincing,”
his
father
said,
“and
I
am
not
inclined
to
trust
my
plans
to
a
man
who
consorts
with
sellswords
and
savages.”

“A
pity
my
savages
ruined
your
dance.”
Tyrion
pulled
off
his
steel
gauntlet
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground,
wincing
at
the
pain
that
stabbed
up
his
arm.

“The
Stark
boy
proved
more
cautious
than
I
expected
for
one
of
his
years,”
Lord
Tywin
admitted,
“but
a
victory
is
a
victory.
You
appear
to
be
wounded.”

Tyrion’s
right
arm
was
soaked
with
blood.
“Good
of
you
to
notice,
Father,”
he
said
through
clenched
teeth.
“Might
I
trouble
you
to
send
for
your
maesters?
Unless
you
relish
the
notion
of
having
a
one-armed
dwarf
for
a
son…”

An
urgent
shout
of
“Lord
Tywin!”
turned
his
father’s
head
before
he
could
reply.
Tywin
Lannister
rose
to
his
feet
as
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
leapt
down
off
his
courser.
The
horse
was
lathered
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth.
Ser
Addam
dropped
to
one
knee,
a
rangy
man
with
dark
copper
hair
that
fell
to
his
shoulders,
armored
in
burnished
bronzed
steel
with
the
fiery
tree
of
his
House
etched
black
on
his
breastplate.
“My
liege,
we
have
taken
some
of
their
commanders.
Lord
Cerwyn,
Ser
Wylis
Manderly,
Harrion
Karstark,
four
Freys.
Lord
Hornwood
is
dead,
and
I
fear
Roose
Bolton
has
escaped
us.”

“And
the
boy?”
Lord
Tywin
asked.

Ser
Addam
hesitated.
“The
Stark
boy
was
not
with
them,
my
lord.
They
say
he
crossed
at
the
Twins
with
the
great
part
of
his
horse,
riding
hard
for
Riverrun.”

A
green
boy,
Tyrion
remembered,
more
like
to
be
brave
than
wise.
He
would
have
laughed,
if
he
hadn’t
hurt
so
much.





CATELYN

The
woods
were
full
of
whispers.

Moonlight
winked
on
the
tumbling
waters
of
the
stream
below
as
it
wound
its
rocky
way
along
the
floor
of
the
valley.
Beneath
the
trees,
warhorses
whickered
softly
and
pawed
at
the
moist,
leafy
ground,
while
men
made
nervous
jests
in
hushed
voices.
Now
and
again,
she
heard
the
chink
of
spears,
the
faint
metallic
slither
of
chain
mail,
but
even
those
sounds
were
muffled.

“It
should
not
be
long
now,
my
lady,”
Hallis
Mollen
said.
He
had
asked
for
the
honor
of
protecting
her
in
the
battle
to
come;
it
was
his
right,
as
Winterfell’s
captain
of
guards,
and
Robb
had
not
refused
it
to
him.
She
had
thirty
men
around
her,
charged
to
keep
her
unharmed
and
see
her
safely
home
to
Winterfell
if
the
fighting
went
against
them.
Robb
had
wanted
fifty;
Catelyn
had
insisted
that
ten
would
be
enough,
that
he
would
need
every
sword
for
the
fight.
They
made
their
peace
at
thirty,
neither
happy
with
it.

“It
will
come
when
it
comes,”
Catelyn
told
him.
When
it
came,
she
knew
it
would
mean
death.
Hal’s
death
perhaps…
or
hers,
or
Robb’s.
No
one
was
safe.
No
life
was
certain.
Catelyn
was
content
to
wait,
to
listen
to
the
whispers
in
the
woods
and
the
faint
music
of
the
brook,
to
feel
the
warm
wind
in
her
hair.

She
was
no
stranger
to
waiting,
after
all.
Her
men
had
always
made
her
wait.
“Watch
for
me,
little
cat,”
her
father
would
always
tell
her,
when
he
rode
off
to
court
or
fair
or
battle.
And
she
would,
standing
patiently
on
the
battlements
of
Riverrun
as
the
waters
of
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone
flowed
by.
He
did
not
always
come
when
he
said
he
would,
and
days
would
ofttimes
pass
as
Catelyn
stood
her
vigil,
peering
out
between
crenels
and
through
arrow
loops
until
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
Lord
Hoster
on
his
old
brown
gelding,
trotting
along
the
rivershore
toward
the
landing.
“Did
you
watch
for
me?”
he’d
ask
when
he
bent
to
bug
her.
“Did
you,
little
cat?”

Brandon
Stark
had
bid
her
wait
as
well.
“I
shall
not
be
long,
my
lady,”
he
had
vowed.
“We
will
be
wed
on
my
return.”
Yet
when
the
day
came
at
last,
it
was
his
brother
Eddard
who
stood
beside
her
in
the
sept.

Ned
had
lingered
scarcely
a
fortnight
with
his
new
bride
before
he
too
had
ridden
off
to
war
with
promises
on
his
lips.
At
least
he
had
left
her
with
more
than
words;
he
had
given
her
a
son.
Nine
moons
had
waxed
and
waned,
and
Robb
had
been
born
in
Riverrun
while
his
father
still
warred
in
the
south.
She
had
brought
him
forth
in
blood
and
pain,
not
knowing
whether
Ned
would
ever
see
him.
Her
son.
He
had
been
so
small…

And
now
it
was
for
Robb
that
she
waited…
for
Robb,
and
for
Jaime
Lannister,
the
gilded
knight
who
men
said
had
never
learned
to
wait
at
all.
“The
Kingslayer
is
restless,
and
quick
to
anger,”
her
uncle
Brynden
had
told
Robb.
And
he
had
wagered
their
lives
and
their
best
hope
of
victory
on
the
truth
of
what
he
said.

If
Robb
was
frightened,
he
gave
no
sign
of
it.
Catelyn
watched
her
son
as
he
moved
among
the
men,
touching
one
on
the
shoulder,
sharing
a
jest
with
another,
helping
a
third
to
gentle
an
anxious
horse.
His
armor
clinked
softly
when
he
moved.
Only
his
head
was
bare.
Catelyn
watched
a
breeze
stir
his
auburn
hair,
so
like
her
own,
and
wondered
when
her
son
had
grown
so
big.
Fifteen,
and
near
as
tall
as
she
was.

Let
him
grow
taller,
she
asked
the
gods.
Let
him
know
sixteen,
and
twenty,
and
fifty.
Let
him
grow
as
tall
as
his
father,
and
hold
his
own
son
in
his
arms.
Please,
please,
please.
As
she
watched
him,
this
tall
young
man
with
the
new
beard
and
the
direwolf
prowling
at
his
heels,
all
she
could
see
was
the
babe
they
had
laid
at
her
breast
at
Riverrun,
so
long
ago.

The
night
was
warm,
but
the
thought
of
Riverrun
was
enough
to
make
her
shiver.
Where
are
they?
she
wondered.
Could
her
uncle
have
been
wrong?
So
much
rested
on
the
truth
of
what
he
had
told
them.
Robb
had
given
the
Blackfish
three
hundred
picked
men,
and
sent
them
ahead
to
screen
his
march.
“Jaime
does
not
know,”
Ser
Brynden
said
when
he
rode
back.
“I’ll
stake
my
life
on
that.
No
bird
has
reached
him,
my
archers
have
seen
to
that.
We’ve
seen
a
few
of
his
outriders,
but
those
that
saw
us
did
not
live
to
tell
of
it.
He
ought
to
have
sent
out
more.
He
does
not
know.”

“How
large
is
his
host?”
her
son
asked.

“Twelve
thousand
foot,
scattered
around
the
castle
in
three
separate
camps,
with
the
rivers
between,”
her
uncle
said,
with
the
craggy
smile
she
remembered
so
well.
“There
is
no
other
way
to
besiege
Riverrun,
yet
still,
that
will
be
their
undoing.
Two
or
three
thousand
horse.”

“The
Kingslayer
has
us
three
to
one,”
said
Galbart
Glover.

‘True
enough,”
Ser
Brynden
said,
“yet
there
is
one
thing
Ser
Jaime
lacks.”

“Yes?”
Robb
asked.

“Patience.”

Their
host
was
greater
than
it
had
been
when
they
left
the
Twins.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
had
brought
his
power
out
from
Seagard
to
join
them
as
they
swept
around
the
headwaters
of
the
Blue
Fork
and
galloped
south,
and
others
had
crept
forth
as
well,
hedge
knights
and
small
lords
and
masterless
men-at-arms
who
had
fled
north
when
her
brother
Edmure’s
army
was
shattered
beneath
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
They
had
driven
their
horses
as
hard
as
they
dared
to
reach
this
place
before
Jaime
Lannister
had
word
of
their
coming,
and
now
the
hour
was
at
hand.

Catelyn
watched
her
son
mount
up.
Olyvar
Frey
held
his
horse
for
him,
Lord
Walder’s
son,
two
years
older
than
Robb,
and
ten
years
younger
and
more
anxious.
He
strapped
Robb’s
shield
in
place
and
handed
up
his
helm.
When
he
lowered
it
over
the
face
she
loved
so
well,
a
tall
young
knight
sat
on
his
grey
stallion
where
her
son
had
been.
It
was
dark
among
the
trees,
where
the
moon
did
not
reach.
When
Robb
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her,
she
could
see
only
black
inside
his
visor.
“I
must
ride
down
the
line,
Mother,”
he
told
her.
“Father
says
you
should
let
the
men
see
you
before
a
battle.”

‘Go,
then,”
she
said.
“Let
them
see
you.”

‘It
will
give
them
courage,”
Robb
said.

And
who
will
give
me
courage?
she
wondered,
yet
she
kept
her
silence
and
made
herself
smile
for
him.
Robb
turned
the
big
grey
stallion
and
walked
him
slowly
away
from
her,
Grey
Wind
shadowing
his
steps.
Behind
him
his
battle
guard
formed
up.
When
he’d
forced
Catelyn
to
accept
her
protectors,
she
had
insisted
that
he
be
guarded
as
well,
and
the
lords
bannermen
had
agreed.
Many
of
their
sons
had
clamored
for
the
honor
of
riding
with
the
Young
Wolf,
as
they
had
taken
to
calling
him.
Torrhen
Karstark
and
his
brother
Eddard
were
among
his
thirty,
and
Patrek
Mallister,
Smalljon
Umber,
Daryn
Hornwood,
Theon
Greyjoy,
no
less
than
five
of
Walder
Frey’s
vast
brood,
along
with
older
men
like
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
and
Robin
Flint.
One
of
his
companions
was
even
a
woman:
Dacey
Mormont,
Lady
Maege’s
eldest
daughter
and
heir
to
Bear
Island,
a
lanky
six-footer
who
had
been
given
a
morningstar
at
an
age
when
most
girls
were
given
dolls.
Some
of
the
other
lords
muttered
about
that,
but
Catelyn
would
not
listen
to
their
complaints.
“This
is
not
about
the
honor
of
your
houses,”
she
told
them.
“This
is
about
keeping
my
son
alive
and
whole.”

And
if
it
comes
to
that,
she
wondered,
will
thirty
be
enough?
Will
six
thousand
be
enough?

A
bird
called
faintly
in
the
distance,
a
high
sharp
trill
that
felt
like
an
icy
hand
on
Catelyn’s
neck.
Another
bird
answered;
a
third,
a
fourth.
She
knew
their
call
well
enough,
from
her
years
at
Winterfell.
Snow
shrikes.
Sometimes
you
saw
them
in
the
deep
of
winter,
when
the
godswood
was
white
and
still.
They
were
northern
birds.

They
are
coming,
Catelyn
thought.

“They’re
coming,
my
lady,”
Hal
Mollen
whispered.
He
was
always
a
man
for
stating
the
obvious.
“Gods
be
with
us.”

She
nodded
as
the
woods
grew
still
around
them.
In
the
quiet
she
could
hear
them,
far
off
yet
moving
closer;
the
tread
of
many
horses,
the
rattle
of
swords
and
spears
and
armor,
the
murmur
of
human
voices,
with
here
a
laugh,
and
there
a
curse.

Eons
seemed
to
come
and
go.
The
sounds
grew
louder.
She
heard
more
laughter,
a
shouted
command,
splashing
as
they
crossed
and
recrossed
the
little
stream.
A
horse
snorted.
A
man
swore.
And
then
at
last
she
saw
him…
only
for
an
instant,
framed
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
as
she
looked
down
at
the
valley
floor,
yet
she
knew
it
was
him.
Even
at
a
distance,
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
was
unmistakable.
The
moonlight
had
silvered
his
armor
and
the
gold
of
his
hair,
and
turned
his
crimson
cloak
to
black.
He
was
not
wearing
a
helm.

He
was
there
and
he
was
gone
again,
his
silvery
armor
obscured
by
the
trees
once
more.
Others
came
behind
him,
long
columns
of
them,
knights
and
sworn
swords
and
freeriders,
three
quarters
of
the
Lannister
horse.

“He
is
no
man
for
sitting
in
a
tent
while
his
carpenters
build
siege
towers,”
Ser
Brynden
had
promised.
“He
has
ridden
out
with
his
knights
thrice
already,
to
chase
down
raiders
or
storm
a
stubborn
holdfast.”

Nodding,
Robb
had
studied
the
map
her
uncle
had
drawn
him.
Ned
had
taught
him
to
read
maps.
“Raid
him
here,”
he
said,
pointing.
“A
few
hundred
men,
no
more.
Tully
banners.
When
he
comes
after
you,
we
will
be
waiting”—his
finger
moved
an
inch
to
the
left—“here.”

Here
was
a
hush
in
the
night,
moonlight
and
shadows,
a
thick
carpet
of
dead
leaves
underfoot,
densely
wooded
ridges
sloping
gently
down
to
the
streambed,
the
underbrush
thinning
as
the
ground
fell
away.

Here
was
her
son
on
his
stallion,
glancing
back
at
her
one
last
time
and
lifting
his
sword
in
salute.

Here
was
the
call
of
Maege
Mormont’s
warhorn,
a
long
low
blast
that
rolled
down
the
valley
from
the
east,
to
tell
them
that
the
last
of
Jaime’s
riders
had
entered
the
trap.

And
Grey
Wind
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.

The
sound
seemed
to
go
right
through
Catelyn
Stark,
and
she
found
herself
shivering.
It
was
a
terrible
sound,
a
frightening
sound,
yet
there
was
music
in
it
too.
For
a
second
she
felt
something
like
pity
for
the
Lannisters
below.
So
this
is
what
death
sounds
like,
she
thought.

HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo
came
the
answer
from
the
far
ridge
as
the
Greatjon
winded
his
own
horn.
To
east
and
west,
the
trumpets
of
the
Mallisters
and
Freys
blew
vengeance.
North,
where
the
valley
narrowed
and
bent
like
a
cocked
elbow,
Lord
Karstark’s
warhorns
added
their
own
deep,
mournful
voices
to
the
dark
chorus.
Men
were
shouting
and
horses
rearing
in
the
stream
below.

The
whispering
wood
let
out
its
breath
all
at
once,
as
the
bowmen
Robb
had
hidden
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
let
fly
their
arrows
and
the
night
erupted
with
the
screams
of
men
and
horses.
All
around
her,
the
riders
raised
their
lances,
and
the
dirt
and
leaves
that
had
buried
the
cruel
bright
points
fell
away
to
reveal
the
gleam
of
sharpened
steel.
“Winterfell!”
she
heard
Robb
shout
as
the
arrows
sighed
again.
He
moved
away
from
her
at
a
trot,
leading
his
men
downhill.

Catelyn
sat
on
her
horse,
unmoving,
with
Hal
Mollen
and
her
guard
around
her,
and
she
waited
as
she
had
waited
before,
for
Brandon
and
Ned
and
her
father.
She
was
high
on
the
ridge,
and
the
trees
hid
most
of
what
was
going
on
beneath
her.
A
heartbeat,
two,
four,
and
suddenly
it
was
as
if
she
and
her
protectors
were
alone
in
the
wood.
The
rest
were
melted
away
into
the
green.

Yet
when
she
looked
across
the
valley
to
the
far
ridge,
she
saw
the
Greatjon’s
riders
emerge
from
the
darkness
beneath
the
trees.
They
were
in
a
long
line,
an
endless
line,
and
as
they
burst
from
the
wood
there
was
an
instant,
the
smallest
part
of
a
heartbeat,
when
all
Catelyn
saw
was
the
moonlight
on
the
points
of
their
lances,
as
if
a
thousand
willowisps
were
coming
down
the
ridge,
wreathed
in
silver
flame.

Then
she
blinked,
and
they
were
only
men,
rushing
down
to
kill
or
die.

Afterward,
she
could
not
claim
she
had
seen
the
battle.
Yet
she
could
hear,
and
the
valley
rang
with
echoes.
The
crack
of
a
broken
lance,
the
clash
of
swords,
the
cries
of
“Lannister”
and
“Winterfell”
and
“Tully!
Riverrun
and
Tully!”
When
she
realized
there
was
no
more
to
see,
she
closed
her
eyes
and
listened.
The
battle
came
alive
around
her.
She
heard
hoofbeats,
iron
boots
splashing
in
shallow
water,
the
woody
sound
of
swords
on
oaken
shields
and
the
scrape
of
steel
against
steel,
the
hiss
of
arrows,
the
thunder
of
drums,
the
terrified
screaming
of
a
thousand
horses.
Men
shouted
curses
and
begged
for
mercy,
and
got
it
(or
not),
and
lived
(or
died).
The
ridges
seemed
to
play
queer
tricks
with
sound.
Once
she
heard
Robb’s
voice,
as
clear
as
if
he’d
been
standing
at
her
side,
calling,
“To
me!
To
me!”
And
she
heard
his
direwolf,
snarling
and
growling,
heard
the
snap
of
those
long
teeth,
the
tearing
of
flesh,
shrieks
of
fear
and
pain
from
man
and
horse
alike.
Was
there
only
one
wolf?
It
was
hard
to
be
certain.

Little
by
little,
the
sounds
dwindled
and
died,
until
at
last
there
was
only
the
wolf.
As
a
red
dawn
broke
in
the
east,
Grey
Wind
began
to
howl
again.

Robb
came
back
to
her
on
a
different
horse,
riding
a
piebald
gelding
in
the
place
of
the
grey
stallion
he
had
taken
down
into
the
valley.
The
wolf’s
head
on
his
shield
was
slashed
half
to
pieces,
raw
wood
showing
where
deep
gouges
had
been
hacked
in
the
oak,
but
Robb
himself
seemed
unhurt.
Yet
when
he
came
closer,
Catelyn
saw
that
his
mailed
glove
and
the
sleeve
of
his
surcoat
were
black
with
blood.
“You’re
hurt,”
she
said.

Robb
lifted
his
hand,
opened
and
closed
his
fingers.
“No,”
he
said.
“This
is…
Torrhen’s
blood,
perhaps,
or…”
He
shook
his
head.
“I
do
not
know.”

A
mob
of
men
followed
him
up
the
slope,
dirty
and
dented
and
grinning,
with
Theon
and
the
Greatjon
at
their
head.
Between
them
they
dragged
Ser
Jaime
Lannister.
They
threw
him
down
in
front
of
her
horse.
“The
Kingslayer,”
Hal
announced,
unnecessarily.

Lannister
raised
his
head.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said
from
his
knees.
Blood
ran
down
one
cheek
from
a
gash
across
his
scalp,
but
the
pale
light
of
dawn
had
put
the
glint
of
gold
back
in
his
hair.
“I
would
offer
you
my
sword,
but
I
seem
to
have
mislaid
it.”

“It
is
not
your
sword
I
want,
ser,”
she
told
him.
“Give
me
my
father
and
my
brother
Edmure.
Give
me
my
daughters.
Give
me
my
lord
husband.”

“I
have
mislaid
them
as
well,
I
fear.”

“A
pity,”
Catelyn
said
coldly.

“Kill
him,
Robb,”
Theon
Greyjoy
urged.
“Take
his
head
off.”

“No,”
her
son
answered,
peeling
off
his
bloody
glove.
“He’s
more
use
alive
than
dead.
And
my
lord
father
never
condoned
the
murder
of
prisoners
after
a
battle.”

“A
wise
man,”
Jaime
Lannister
said,
“and
honorable.”

“Take
him
away
and
put
him
in
irons,”
Catelyn
said.

“Do
as
my
lady
mother
says,”
Robb
commanded,
“and
make
certain
there’s
a
strong
guard
around
him.
Lord
Karstark
will
want
his
head
on
a
pike.”

“That
he
will,”
the
Greatjon
agreed,
gesturing.
Lannister
was
led
away
to
be
bandaged
and
chained.

“Why
should
Lord
Karstark
want
him
dead?”
Catelyn
asked.

Robb
looked
away
into
the
woods,
with
the
same
brooding
look
that
Ned
often
got.
“He…
he
killed
them…”

“Lord
Karstark’s
sons,”
Galbart
Glover
explained.

“Both
of
them,”
said
Robb.
“Torrhen
and
Eddard.
And
Daryn
Hornwood
as
well.”

“No
one
can
fault
Lannister
on
his
courage,”
Glover
said.
“When
he
saw
that
he
was
lost,
he
rallied
his
retainers
and
fought
his
way
up
the
valley,
hoping
to
reach
Lord
Robb
and
cut
him
down.
And
almost
did.”

“He
mislaid
his
sword
in
Eddard
Karstark’s
neck,
after
he
took
Torrhen’s
hand
off
and
split
Daryn
Hornwood’s
skull
open,”
Robb
said.
“All
the
time
he
was
shouting
for
me.
If
they
hadn’t
tried
to
stop
him—”

“—I
should
then
be
mourning
in
place
of
Lord
Karstark,”
Catelyn
said.
“Your
men
did
what
they
were
sworn
to
do,
Robb.
They
died
protecting
their
liege
lord.
Grieve
for
them.
Honor
them
for
their
valor.
But
not
now.
You
have
no
time
for
grief.
You
may
have
lopped
the
head
off
the
snake,
but
three
quarters
of
the
body
is
still
coiled
around
my
father’s
castle.
We
have
won
a
battle,
not
a
war.”

“But
such
a
battle!”
said
Theon
Greyjoy
eagerly.
“My
lady,
the
realm
has
not
seen
such
a
victory
since
the
Field
of
Fire.
I
vow,
the
Lannisters
lost
ten
men
for
every
one
of
ours
that
fell.
We’ve
taken
close
to
a
hundred
knights
captive,
and
a
dozen
lords
bannermen.
Lord
Westerling,
Lord
Banefort,
Ser
Garth
Greenfield,
Lord
Estren,
Ser
Tytos
Brax,
Mallor
the
Dornishman…
and
three
Lannisters
besides
Jaime,
Lord
Tywin’s
own
nephews,
two
of
his
sister’s
sons
and
one
of
his
dead
brother’s…”

“And
Lord
Tywin?”
Catelyn
interrupted.
“Have
you
perchance
taken
Lord
Tywin,
Theon?”

“No,”
Greyjoy
answered,
brought
up
short.

“Until
you
do,
this
war
is
far
from
done.”

Robb
raised
his
head
and
pushed
his
hair
back
out
of
his
eyes.
“My
mother
is
right.
We
still
have
Riverrun.”





DAENERYS

The
flies
circled
Khal
Drogo
slowly,
their
wings
buzzing,
a
low
thrum
at
the
edge
of
hearing
that
filled
Dany
with
dread.

The
sun
was
high
and
pitiless.
Heat
shimmered
in
waves
off
the
stony
outcrops
of
low
hills.
A
thin
finger
of
sweat
trickled
slowly
between
Dany’s
swollen
breasts.
The
only
sounds
were
the
steady
clop
of
their
horses’
hooves,
the
rhythmic
tingle
of
the
bells
in
Drogo’s
hair,
and
the
distant
voices
behind
them.

Dany
watched
the
flies.

They
were
as
large
as
bees,
gross,
purplish,
glistening.
The
Dothraki
called
them
bloodflies.
They
lived
in
marshes
and
stagnant
pools,
sucked
blood
from
man
and
horse
alike,
and
laid
their
eggs
in
the
dead
and
dying.
Drogo
hated
them.
Whenever
one
came
near
him,
his
hand
would
shoot
out
quick
as
a
striking
snake
to
close
around
it.
She
had
never
seen
him
miss.
He
would
hold
the
fly
inside
his
huge
fist
long
enough
to
hear
its
frantic
buzzing.
Then
his
fingers
would
tighten,
and
when
he
opened
his
hand
again,
the
fly
would
be
only
a
red
smear
on
his
palm.

Now
one
crept
across
the
rump
of
his
stallion,
and
the
horse
gave
an
angry
flick
of
its
tail
to
brush
it
away.
The
others
flitted
about
Drogo,
closer
and
closer.
The
khal
did
not
react.
His
eyes
were
fixed
on
distant
brown
hills,
the
reins
loose
in
his
hands.
Beneath
his
painted
vest,
a
plaster
of
fig
leaves
and
caked
blue
mud
covered
the
wound
on
his
breast.
The
herbwomen
had
made
it
for
him.
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
poultice
had
itched
and
burned,
and
he
had
torn
it
off
six
days
ago,
cursing
her
for
a
maegi.
The
mud
plaster
was
more
soothing,
and
the
herbwomen
made
him
poppy
wine
as
well.
He’d
been
drinking
it
heavily
these
past
three
days;
when
it
was
not
poppy
wine,
it
was
fermented
mare’s
milk
or
pepper
beer.

Yet
he
scarcely
touched
his
food,
and
he
thrashed
and
groaned
in
the
night.
Dany
could
see
how
drawn
his
face
had
become.
Rhaego
was
restless
in
her
belly,
kicking
like
a
stallion,
yet
even
that
did
not
stir
Drogo’s
interest
as
it
had.
Every
morning
her
eyes
found
fresh
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
when
he
woke
from
his
troubled
sleep.
And
now
this
silence.
It
was
making
her
afraid.
Since
they
had
mounted
up
at
dawn,
he
had
said
not
a
word.
When
she
spoke,
she
got
no
answer
but
a
grunt,
and
not
even
that
much
since
midday.

One
of
the
bloodflies
landed
on
the
bare
skin
of
the
khal’s
shoulder.
Another,
circling,
touched
down
on
his
neck
and
crept
up
toward
his
mouth.
Khal
Drogo
swayed
in
the
saddle,
bells
ringing,
as
his
stallion
kept
onward
at
a
steady
walking
pace.

Dany
pressed
her
heels
into
her
silver
and
rode
closer.
“My
lord,”
she
said
softly.
“Drogo.
My
sun-and-stars.”

He
did
not
seem
to
hear.
The
bloodfly
crawled
up
under
his
drooping
mustache
and
settled
on
his
cheek,
in
the
crease
beside
his
nose.
Dany
gasped,
“Drogo.”
Clumsily
she
reached
over
and
touched
his
arm.

Khal
Drogo
reeled
in
the
saddle,
tilted
slowly,
and
fell
heavily
from
his
horse.
The
flies
scattered
for
a
heartbeat,
and
then
circled
back
to
settle
on
him
where
he
lay.

“No,”
Dany
said,
reining
up.
Heedless
of
her
belly
for
once,
she
scrambled
off
her
silver
and
ran
to
him.

The
grass
beneath
him
was
brown
and
dry.
Drogo
cried
out
in
pain
as
Dany
knelt
beside
him.
His
breath
rattled
harshly
in
his
throat,
and
he
looked
at
her
without
recognition.
“My
horse,”
he
gasped.
Dany
brushed
the
flies
off
his
chest,
smashing
one
as
he
would
have.
His
skin
burned
beneath
her
fingers.

The
khal’s
bloodriders
had
been
following
just
behind
them.
She
heard
Haggo
shout
as
they
galloped
up.
Cohollo
vaulted
from
his
horse.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
he
said
as
he
dropped
to
his
knees.
The
other
two
kept
to
their
mounts.

“No,”
Khal
Drogo
groaned,
struggling
in
Dany’s
arms.
“Must
ride.
Ride.
No.”

“He
fell
from
his
horse,”
Haggo
said,
staring
down.
His
broad
face
was
impassive,
but
his
voice
was
leaden.

“You
must
not
say
that,”
Dany
told
him.
“We
have
ridden
far
enough
today.
We
will
camp
here.”

“Here?”
Haggo
looked
around
them.
The
land
was
brown
and
sere,
inhospitable.
“This
is
no
camping
ground.”

“It
is
not
for
a
woman
to
bid
us
halt,”
said
Qotho,
“not
even
a
khaleesi.”

“We
camp
here,”
Dany
repeated.
“Haggo,
tell
them
Khal
Drogo
commanded
the
halt.
If
any
ask
why,
say
to
them
that
my
time
is
near
and
I
could
not
continue.
Cohollo,
bring
up
the
slaves,
they
must
put
up
the
khal’s
tent
at
once.
Qotho—”

“You
do
not
command
me,
Khaleesi,”
Qotho
said.

“Find
Mirri
Maz
Duur,”
she
told
him.
The
godswife
would
be
walking
among
the
other
Lamb
Men,
in
the
long
column
of
slaves.
“Bring
her
to
me,
with
her
chest.”

Qotho
glared
down
at
her,
his
eyes
hard
as
flint.
“The
maegi.”
He
spat.
“This
I
will
not
do.”

“You
will,”
Dany
said,
“or
when
Drogo
wakes,
he
will
hear
why
you
defied
me.”

Furious,
Qotho
wheeled
his
stallion
around
and
galloped
off
in
anger…
but
Dany
knew
he
would
return
with
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
however
little
he
might
like
it.
The
slaves
erected
Khal
Drogo’s
tent
beneath
a
jagged
outcrop
of
black
rock
whose
shadow
gave
some
relief
from
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
sun.
Even
so,
it
was
stifling
under
the
sandsilk
as
Irri
and
Doreah
helped
Dany
walk
Drogo
inside.
Thick
patterned
carpets
had
been
laid
down
over
the
ground,
and
pillows
scattered
in
the
corners.
Eroeh,
the
timid
girl
Dany
had
rescued
outside
the
mud
walls
of
the
Lamb
Men,
set
up
a
brazier.
They
stretched
Drogo
out
on
a
woven
mat.
“No,”
he
muttered
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“No,
no.”
It
was
all
he
said,
all
he
seemed
capable
of
saying.

Doreah
unhooked
his
medallion
belt
and
stripped
off
his
vest
and
leggings,
while
Jhiqui
knelt
by
his
feet
to
undo
the
laces
of
his
riding
sandals.
Irri
wanted
to
leave
the
tent
flaps
open
to
let
in
the
breeze,
but
Dany
forbade
it.
She
would
not
have
any
see
Drogo
this
way,
in
delirium
and
weakness.
When
her
khas
came
up,
she
posted
them
outside
at
guard.
“Admit
no
one
without
my
leave,”
she
told
Jhogo.
“No
one.”

Eroeh
stared
fearfully
at
Drogo
where
he
lay.
“He
dies,”
she
whispered.

Dany
slapped
her.
“The
khal
cannot
die.
He
is
the
father
of
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.
His
hair
has
never
been
cut.
He
still
wears
the
bells
his
father
gave
him.”

“Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
said,
“he
fell
from
his
horse.”

Trembling,
her
eyes
full
of
sudden
tears,
Dany
turned
away
from
them.
He
fell
from
his
horse!
It
was
so,
she
had
seen
it,
and
the
bloodriders,
and
no
doubt
her
handmaids
and
the
men
of
her
khas
as
well.
And
how
many
more?
They
could
not
keep
it
secret,
and
Dany
knew
what
that
meant.
A
khal
who
could
not
ride
could
not
rule,
and
Drogo
had
fallen
from
his
horse.

“We
must
bathe
him,”
she
said
stubbornly.
She
must
not
allow
herself
to
despair.
“Irri,
have
the
tub
brought
at
once.
Doreah,
Eroeh,
find
water,
cool
water,
he’s
so
hot.”
He
was
a
fire
in
human
skin.

The
slaves
set
up
the
heavy
copper
tub
in
the
corner
of
the
tent.
When
Doreah
brought
the
first
jar
of
water,
Dany
wet
a
length
of
silk
to
lay
across
Drogo’s
brow,
over
the
burning
skin.
His
eyes
looked
at
her,
but
he
did
not
see.
When
his
lips
opened,
no
words
escaped
them,
only
a
moan.
“Where
is
Mirri
Maz
Duur?”
she
demanded,
her
patience
rubbed
raw
with
fear.

“Qotho
will
find
her,”
Irri
said.

Her
handmaids
filled
the
tub
with
tepid
water
that
stank
of
sulfur,
sweetening
it
with
jars
of
bitter
oil
and
handfuls
of
crushed
mint
leaves.
While
the
bath
was
being
prepared,
Dany
knelt
awkwardly
beside
her
lord
husband,
her
belly
great
with
their
child
within.
She
undid
his
braid
with
anxious
fingers,
as
she
had
on
the
night
he’d
taken
her
for
the
first
time,
beneath
the
stars.
His
bells
she
laid
aside
carefully,
one
by
one.
He
would
want
them
again
when
he
was
well,
she
told
herself.

A
breath
of
air
entered
the
tent
as
Aggo
poked
his
head
through
the
silk.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said,
“the
Andal
is
come,
and
begs
leave
to
enter.”

“The
Andal”
was
what
the
Dothraki
called
Ser
Jorah.
“Yes,”
she
said,
rising
clumsily,
“send
him
in.”
She
trusted
the
knight.
He
would
know
what
to
do
if
anyone
did.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
ducked
through
the
door
flap
and
waited
a
moment
for
his
eyes
to
adjust
to
the
dimness.
In
the
fierce
heat
of
the
south,
he
wore
loose
trousers
of
mottled
sandsilk
and
open-toed
riding
sandals
that
laced
up
to
his
knee.
His
scabbard
hung
from
a
twisted
horsehair
belt.
Under
a
bleached
white
vest,
he
was
bare-chested,
skin
reddened
by
the
sun.
“Talk
goes
from
mouth
to
ear,
all
over
the
khalasar,”
he
said.
“It
is
said
Khal
Drogo
fell
from
his
horse.”

“Help
him,”
Dany
pleaded.
“For
the
love
you
say
you
bear
me,
help
him
now.”

The
knight
knelt
beside
her.
He
looked
at
Drogo
long
and
hard,
and
then
at
Dany.
“Send
your
maids
away.”

Wordlessly,
her
throat
tight
with
fear,
Dany
made
a
gesture.
Irri
herded
the
other
girls
from
the
tent.

When
they
were
alone,
Ser
Jorah
drew
his
dagger.
Deftly,
with
a
delicacy
surprising
in
such
a
big
man,
he
began
to
scrape
away
the
black
leaves
and
dried
blue
mud
from
Drogo’s
chest.
The
plaster
had
caked
hard
as
the
mud
walls
of
the
Lamb
Men,
and
like
those
walls
it
cracked
easily.
Ser
Jorah
broke
the
dry
mud
with
his
knife,
pried
the
chunks
from
the
flesh,
peeled
off
the
leaves
one
by
one.
A
foul,
sweet
smell
rose
from
the
wound,
so
thick
it
almost
choked
her.
The
leaves
were
crusted
with
blood
and
pus,
Drogo’s
breast
black
and
glistening
with
corruption.

“No,”
Dany
whispered
as
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks.
“No,
please,
gods
hear
me,
no.”

Khal
Drogo
thrashed,
fighting
some
unseen
enemy.
Black
blood
ran
slow
and
thick
from
his
open
wound.

“Your
khal
is
good
as
dead,
Princess.”

“No,
he
can’t
die,
he
mustn’t,
it
was
only
a
cut.”
Dany
took
his
large
callused
hand
in
her
own
small
ones,
and
held
it
tight
between
them.
“I
will
not
let
him
die…”

Ser
Jorah
gave
a
bitter
laugh.
“Khaleesi
or
queen,
that
command
is
beyond
your
power.
Save
your
tears,
child.
Weep
for
him
tomorrow,
or
a
year
from
now.
We
do
not
have
time
for
grief.
We
must
go,
and
quickly,
before
he
dies.”

Dany
was
lost.
“Go?
Where
should
we
go?”

“Asshai,
I
would
say.
It
lies
far
to
the
south,
at
the
end
of
the
known
world,
yet
men
say
it
is
a
great
port.
We
will
find
a
ship
to
take
us
back
to
Pentos.
It
will
be
a
hard
journey,
make
no
mistake.
Do
you
trust
your
khas?
Will
they
come
with
us?”

“Khal
Drogo
commanded
them
to
keep
me
safe,”
Dany
replied
uncertainly,
“but
if
he
dies…”
She
touched
the
swell
of
her
belly.
“I
don’t
understand.
Why
should
we
flee?
I
am
khaleesi.
I
carry
Drogo’s
heir.
He
will
be
khal
after
Drogo…”

Ser
Jorah
frowned.
“Princess,
hear
me.
The
Dothraki
will
not
follow
a
suckling
babe.
Drogo’s
strength
was
what
they
bowed
to,
and
only
that.
When
he
is
gone,
Jhaqo
and
Pono
and
the
other
kos
will
fight
for
his
place,
and
this
khalasar
will
devour
itself.
The
winner
will
want
no
more
rivals.
The
boy
will
be
taken
from
your
breast
the
moment
he
is
born.
They
will
give
him
to
the
dogs…”

Dany
hugged
herself.
“But
why?”
she
cried
plaintively.
“Why
should
they
kill
a
little
baby?”

“He
is
Drogo’s
son,
and
the
crones
say
he
will
be
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.
It
was
prophesied.
Better
to
kill
the
child
than
to
risk
his
fury
when
he
grows
to
manhood.”

The
child
kicked
inside
her,
as
if
he
had
heard.
Dany
remembered
the
story
Viserys
had
told
her,
of
what
the
Usurper’s
dogs
had
done
to
Rhaegar’s
children.
His
son
had
been
a
babe
as
well,
yet
they
had
ripped
him
from
his
mother’s
breast
and
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.
That
was
the
way
of
men.
“They
must
not
hurt
my
son!”
she
cried.
“I
will
order
my
khas
to
keep
him
safe,
and
Drogo’s
bloodriders
will—”

Ser
Jorah
held
her
by
the
shoulders.
“A
bloodrider
dies
with
his
khal.
You
know
that,
child.
They
will
take
you
to
Vaes
Dothrak,
to
the
crones,
that
is
the
last
duty
they
owe
him
in
life…
when
it
is
done,
they
will
join
Drogo
in
the
night
lands.”

Dany
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
Vaes
Dothrak
and
live
the
rest
of
her
life
among
those
terrible
old
women,
yet
she
knew
that
the
knight
spoke
the
truth.
Drogo
had
been
more
than
her
sun-and-stars;
he
had
been
the
shield
that
kept
her
safe.
“I
will
not
leave
him,”
she
said
stubbornly,
miserably.
She
took
his
hand
again.
“I
will
not.”

A
stirring
at
the
tent
flap
made
Dany
turn
her
head.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
entered,
bowing
low.
Days
on
the
march,
trailing
behind
the
khalasar,
had
left
her
limping
and
haggard,
with
blistered
and
bleeding
feet
and
hollows
under
her
eyes.
Behind
her
came
Qotho
and
Haggo,
carrying
the
godswife’s
chest
between
them.
When
the
bloodriders
caught
sight
of
Drogo’s
wound,
the
chest
slipped
from
Haggo’s
fingers
and
crashed
to
the
floor
of
the
tent,
and
Qotho
swore
an
oath
so
foul
it
seared
the
air.

Mirri
Maz
Duur
studied
Drogo,
her
face
still
and
dead.
“The
wound
has
festered.”

“This
is
your
work,
maegi,”
Qotho
said.
Haggo
laid
his
fist
across
Mirri’s
cheek
with
a
meaty
smack
that
drove
her
to
the
ground.
Then
he
kicked
her
where
she
lay.

“Stop
it!”
Dany
screamed.

Qotho
pulled
Haggo
away,
saying,
“Kicks
are
too
merciful
for
a
maegi.
Take
her
outside.
We
will
stake
her
to
the
earth,
to
be
the
mount
of
every
passing
man.
And
when
they
are
done
with
her,
the
dogs
will
use
her
as
well.
Weasels
will
tear
out
her
entrails
and
carrion
crows
feast
upon
her
eyes.
The
flies
off
the
river
shall
lay
their
eggs
in
her
womb
and
drink
pus
from
the
ruins
of
her
breasts…”
He
dug
iron-hard
fingers
into
the
soft,
wobbly
flesh
under
the
godswife’s
arm
and
hauled
her
to
her
feet.

“No,”
Dany
said.
“I
will
not
have
her
harmed.”

Qotho’s
lips
skinned
back
from
his
crooked
brown
teeth
in
a
terrible
mockery
of
a
smile.
“No?
You
say
me
no?
Better
you
should
pray
that
we
do
not
stake
you
out
beside
your
maegi.
You
did
this,
as
much
as
the
other.”

Ser
Jorah
stepped
between
them,
loosening
his
longsword
in
its
scabbard.
“Rein
in
your
tongue,
bloodrider.
The
princess
is
still
your
khaleesi.
“

“Only
while
the
blood-of-my-blood
still
lives,”
Qotho
told
the
knight.
“When
he
dies,
she
is
nothing.”

Dany
felt
a
tightness
inside
her.
“Before
I
was
khaleesi,
I
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
Ser
Jorah,
summon
my
khas.”

“No,”
said
Qotho.
“We
will
go.
For
now…
Khaleesi.”
Haggo
followed
him
from
the
tent,
scowling.

“That
one
means
you
no
good,
Princess,”
Mormont
said.
“The
Dothraki
say
a
man
and
his
bloodriders
share
one
life,
and
Qotho
sees
it
ending.
A
dead
man
is
beyond
fear.”

“No
one
has
died,”
Dany
said.
“Ser
Jorah,
I
may
have
need
of
your
blade.
Best
go
don
your
armor.”
She
was
more
frightened
than
she
dared
admit,
even
to
herself.

The
knight
bowed.
“As
you
say.”
He
strode
from
the
tent.

Dany
turned
back
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
The
woman’s
eyes
were
wary.
“So
you
have
saved
me
once
more.”

“And
now
you
must
save
him,”
Dany
said.
“Please…”

“You
do
not
ask
a
slave,”
Mirri
replied
sharply,
“you
tell
her.”
She
went
to
Drogo
burning
on
his
mat,
and
gazed
long
at
his
wound.
“Ask
or
tell,
it
makes
no
matter.
He
is
beyond
a
healer’s
skills.”
The
khal’s
eyes
were
closed.
She
opened
one
with
her
fingers.
“He
has
been
dulling
the
hurt
with
milk
of
the
poppy.”

“Yes,”
Dany
admitted.

“I
made
him
a
poultice
of
firepod
and
sting-me-not
and
bound
it
in
a
lambskin.”

“It
burned,
he
said.
He
tore
it
off.
The
herbwomen
made
him
a
new
one,
wet
and
soothing.”

“It
burned,
yes.
There
is
great
healing
magic
in
fire,
even
your
hairless
men
know
that.”

“Make
him
another
poultice,”
Dany
begged.
“This
time
I
will
make
certain
he
wears
it.”

“The
time
for
that
is
past,
my
lady,”
Mirri
said.
“All
I
can
do
now
is
ease
the
dark
road
before
him,
so
he
might
ride
painless
to
the
night
lands.
He
will
be
gone
by
morning.”

Her
words
were
a
knife
through
Dany’s
breast.
What
had
she
ever
done
to
make
the
gods
so
cruel?
She
had
finally
found
a
safe
place,
had
finally
tasted
love
and
hope.
She
was
finally
going
home.
And
now
to
lose
it
all…“No,”
she
pleaded.
“Save
him,
and
I
will
free
you,
I
swear
it.
You
must
know
a
way…
some
magic,
some…”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
sat
back
on
her
heels
and
studied
Daenerys
through
eyes
as
black
as
night.
“There
is
a
spell.”
Her
voice
was
quiet,
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper.
“But
it
is
hard,
lady,
and
dark.
Some
would
say
that
death
is
cleaner.
I
learned
the
way
in
Asshai,
and
paid
dear
for
the
lesson.
My
teacher
was
a
bloodmage
from
the
Shadow
Lands.”

Dany
went
cold
all
over.
“Then
you
truly
are
a
maegi…”

“Am
I?”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
smiled.
“Only
a
maegi
can
save
your
rider
now,
Silver
Lady.”

“Is
there
no
other
way?”

“No
other.”

Khal
Drogo
gave
a
shuddering
gasp.

“Do
it,”
Dany
blurted.
She
must
not
be
afraid;
she
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
“Save
him.”

“There
is
a
price,”
the
godswife
warned
her.

“You’ll
have
gold,
horses,
whatever
you
like.”

“It
is
not
a
matter
of
gold
or
horses.
This
is
bloodmagic,
lady.
Only
death
may
pay
for
life.”

“Death?”
Dany
wrapped
her
arms
around
herself
protectively,
rocked
back
and
forth
on
her
heels.
“My
death?”
She
told
herself
she
would
die
for
him,
if
she
must.
She
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
would
not
be
afraid.
Her
brother
Rhaegar
had
died
for
the
woman
he
loved.

“No,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
promised.
“Not
your
death,
Khaleesi.”

Dany
trembled
with
relief.
“Do
it.”

The
maegi
nodded
solemnly.
“As
you
speak,
so
it
shall
be
done.
Call
your
servants.”

Khal
Drogo
writhed
feebly
as
Rakharo
and
Quaro
lowered
him
into
the
bath.
“No,”
he
muttered,
“no.
Must
ride.”
Once
in
the
water,
all
the
strength
seemed
to
leak
out
of
him.

“Bring
his
horse,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
commanded,
and
so
it
was
done.
Jhogo
led
the
great
red
stallion
into
the
tent.
When
the
animal
caught
the
scent
of
death,
he
screamed
and
reared,
rolling
his
eyes.
It
took
three
men
to
subdue
him.

“What
do
you
mean
to
do?”
Dany
asked
her.

“We
need
the
blood,”
Mirri
answered.
“That
is
the
way.”

Jhogo
edged
back,
his
hand
on
his
arakh.
He
was
a
youth
of
sixteen
years,
whip-thin,
fearless,
quick
to
laugh,
with
the
faint
shadow
of
his
first
mustachio
on
his
upper
lip.
He
fell
to
his
knees
before
her.
“Khaleesi,”
he
pleaded,
“you
must
not
do
this
thing.
Let
me
kill
this
maegi.”

“Kill
her
and
you
kill
your
khal,”
Dany
said.

“This
is
bloodmagic,”
he
said.
“It
is
forbidden.”

“I
am
khaleesi,
and
I
say
it
is
not
forbidden.
In
Vaes
Dothrak,
Khal
Drogo
slew
a
stallion
and
I
ate
his
heart,
to
give
our
son
strength
and
courage.
This
is
the
same.
The
same.”

The
stallion
kicked
and
reared
as
Rakharo,
Quaro,
and
Aggo
pulled
him
close
to
the
tub
where
the
khal
floated
like
one
already
dead,
pus
and
blood
seeping
from
his
wound
to
stain
the
bathwaters.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
chanted
words
in
a
tongue
that
Dany
did
not
know,
and
a
knife
appeared
in
her
hand.
Dany
never
saw
where
it
came
from.
It
looked
old;
hammered
red
bronze,
leaf-shaped,
its
blade
covered
with
ancient
glyphs.
The
maegi
drew
it
across
the
stallion’s
throat,
under
the
noble
head,
and
the
horse
screamed
and
shuddered
as
the
blood
poured
out
of
him
in
a
red
rush.
He
would
have
collapsed,
but
the
men
of
her
khas
held
him
up.
“Strength
of
the
mount,
go
into
the
rider,”
Mirri
sang
as
horse
blood
swirled
into
the
waters
of
Drogo’s
bath.
“Strength
of
the
beast,
go
into
the
man.”

Jhogo
looked
terrified
as
he
struggled
with
the
stallion’s
weight,
afraid
to
touch
the
dead
flesh,
yet
afraid
to
let
go
as
well.
Only
a
horse,
Dany
thought.
If
she
could
buy
Drogo’s
life
with
the
death
of
a
horse,
she
would
pay
a
thousand
times
over.

When
they
let
the
stallion
fall,
the
bath
was
a
dark
red,
and
nothing
showed
of
Drogo
but
his
face.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
no
use
for
the
carcass.
“Burn
it,”
Dany
told
them.
It
was
what
they
did,
she
knew.
When
a
man
died,
his
mount
was
killed
and
placed
beneath
him
on
the
funeral
pyre,
to
carry
him
to
the
night
lands.
The
men
of
her
khas
dragged
the
carcass
from
the
tent.
The
blood
had
gone
everywhere.
Even
the
sandsilk
walls
were
spotted
with
red,
and
the
rugs
underfoot
were
black
and
wet.

Braziers
were
lit.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
tossed
a
red
powder
onto
the
coals.
It
gave
the
smoke
a
spicy
scent,
a
pleasant
enough
smell,
yet
Eroeh
fled
sobbing,
and
Dany
was
filled
with
fear.
But
she
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
now.
She
sent
her
handmaids
away.
“Go
with
them,
Silver
Lady,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
told
her.

“I
will
stay,”
Dany
said.
“The
man
took
me
under
the
stars
and
gave
life
to
the
child
inside
me.
I
will
not
leave
him.”

“You
must.
Once
I
begin
to
sing,
no
one
must
enter
this
tent.
My
song
will
wake
powers
old
and
dark.
The
dead
will
dance
here
this
night.
No
living
man
must
look
on
them.”

Dany
bowed
her
head,
helpless.
“No
one
will
enter.”
She
bent
over
the
tub,
over
Drogo
in
his
bath
of
blood,
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
brow.
“Bring
him
back
to
me,”
she
whispered
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur
before
she
fled.

Outside,
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon,
the
sky
a
bruised
red.
The
khalasar
had
made
camp.
Tents
and
sleeping
mats
were
scattered
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
A
hot
wind
blew.
Jhogo
and
Aggo
were
digging
a
firepit
to
burn
the
dead
stallion.
A
crowd
had
gathered
to
stare
at
Dany
with
hard
black
eyes,
their
faces
like
masks
of
beaten
copper.
She
saw
Ser
Jorah
Mormont,
wearing
mail
and
leather
now,
sweat
beading
on
his
broad,
balding
forehead.
He
pushed
his
way
through
the
Dothraki
to
Dany’s
side.
When
he
saw
the
scarlet
footprints
her
boots
had
left
on
the
ground,
the
color
seemed
to
drain
from
his
face.
“What
have
you
done,
you
little
fool?”
he
asked
hoarsely.

“I
had
to
save
him.”

“We
could
have
fled,”
he
said.
“I
would
have
seen
you
safe
to
Asshai,
Princess.
There
was
no
need…”

“Am
I
truly
your
princess?”
she
asked
him.

“You
know
you
are,
gods
save
us
both.”

“Then
help
me
now.”

Ser
Jorah
grimaced.
“Would
that
I
knew
how.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
rose
to
a
high,
ululating
wail
that
sent
a
shiver
down
Dany’s
back.
Some
of
the
Dothraki
began
to
mutter
and
back
away.
The
tent
was
aglow
with
the
light
of
braziers
within.
Through
the
blood-spattered
sandsilk,
she
glimpsed
shadows
moving.

Mirri
Maz
Duur
was
dancing,
and
not
alone.

Dany
saw
naked
fear
on
the
faces
of
the
Dothraki.
“This
must
not
be,”
Qotho
thundered.

She
had
not
seen
the
bloodrider
return.
Haggo
and
Cohollo
were
with
him.
They
had
brought
the
hairless
men,
the
eunuchs
who
healed
with
knife
and
needle
and
fire.

“This
will
be,”
Dany
replied.

“Maegi,”
Haggo
growled.
And
old
Cohollo—Cohollo
who
had
bound
his
life
to
Drogo’s
on
the
day
of
his
birth,
Cohollo
who
had
always
been
kind
to
her—Cohollo
spat
full
in
her
face.

“You
will
die,
maegi,”
Qotho
promised,
“but
the
other
must
die
first.”
He
drew
his
arakh
and
made
for
the
tent.

“No,”
she
shouted,
“you
mustn’t.”
She
caught
him
by
the
shoulder,
but
Qotho
shoved
her
aside.
Dany
fell
to
her
knees,
crossing
her
arms
over
her
belly
to
protect
the
child
within.
“Stop
him,”
she
commanded
her
khas,
“kill
him.”

Rakharo
and
Quaro
stood
beside
the
tent
flap.
Quaro
took
a
step
forward,
reaching
for
the
handle
of
his
whip,
but
Qotho
spun
graceful
as
a
dancer,
the
curved
arakh
rising.
It
caught
Quaro
low
under
the
arm,
the
bright
sharp
steel
biting
up
through
leather
and
skin,
through
muscle
and
rib
bone.
Blood
fountained
as
the
young
rider
reeled
backward,
gasping.

Qotho
wrenched
the
blade
free.
“Horselord,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
called.
“Try
me.”
His
longsword
slid
from
its
scabbard.

Qotho
whirled,
cursing.
The
arakh
moved
so
fast
that
Quaro’s
blood
flew
from
it
in
a
fine
spray,
like
rain
in
a
hot
wind.
The
longsword
caught
it
a
foot
from
Ser
Jorah’s
face,
and
held
it
quivering
for
an
instant
as
Qotho
howled
in
fury.
The
knight
was
clad
in
chainmail,
with
gauntlets
and
greaves
of
lobstered
steel
and
a
heavy
gorget
around
his
throat,
but
he
had
not
thought
to
don
his
helm.

Qotho
danced
backward,
arakh
whirling
around
his
head
in
a
shining
blur,
flickering
out
like
lightning
as
the
knight
came
on
in
a
rush.
Ser
Jorah
parried
as
best
he
could,
but
the
slashes
came
so
fast
that
it
seemed
to
Dany
that
Qotho
had
four
arakhs
and
as
many
arms.
She
heard
the
crunch
of
sword
on
mail,
saw
sparks
fly
as
the
long
curved
blade
glanced
off
a
gauntlet.
Suddenly
it
was
Mormont
stumbling
backward,
and
Qotho
leaping
to
the
attack.
The
left
side
of
the
knight’s
face
ran
red
with
blood,
and
a
cut
to
the
hip
opened
a
gash
in
his
mail
and
left
him
limping.
Qotho
screamed
taunts
at
him,
calling
him
a
craven,
a
milk
man,
a
eunuch
in
an
iron
suit.
“You
die
now!”
he
promised,
arakh
shivering
through
the
red
twilight.
Inside
Dany’s
womb,
her
son
kicked
wildly.
The
curved
blade
slipped
past
the
straight
one
and
bit
deep
into
the
knight’s
hip
where
the
mail
gaped
open.

Mormont
grunted,
stumbled.
Dany
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
her
belly,
a
wetness
on
her
thighs.
Qotho
shrieked
triumph,
but
his
arakh
had
found
bone,
and
for
half
a
heartbeat
it
caught.

It
was
enough.
Ser
Jorah
brought
his
longsword
down
with
all
the
strength
left
him,
through
flesh
and
muscle
and
bone,
and
Qotho’s
forearm
dangled
loose,
flopping
on
a
thin
cord
of
skin
and
sinew.
The
knight’s
next
cut
was
at
the
Dothraki’s
ear,
so
savage
that
Qotho’s
face
seemed
almost
to
explode.

The
Dothraki
were
shouting,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
wailing
inside
the
tent
like
nothing
human,
Quaro
pleading
for
water
as
he
died.
Dany
cried
out
for
help,
but
no
one
heard.
Rakharo
was
fighting
Haggo,
arakh
dancing
with
arakh
until
Jhogo’s
whip
cracked,
loud
as
thunder,
the
lash
coiling
around
Haggo’s
throat.
A
yank,
and
the
bloodrider
stumbled
backward,
losing
his
feet
and
his
sword.
Rakharo
sprang
forward,
howling,
swinging
his
arakh
down
with
both
hands
through
the
top
of
Haggo’s
head.
The
point
caught
between
his
eyes,
red
and
quivering.
Someone
threw
a
stone,
and
when
Dany
looked,
her
shoulder
was
torn
and
bloody.
“No,”
she
wept,
“no,
please,
stop
it,
it’s
too
high,
the
price
is
too
high.”
More
stones
came
flying.
She
tried
to
crawl
toward
the
tent,
but
Cohollo
caught
her.
Fingers
in
her
hair,
he
pulled
her
head
back
and
she
felt
the
cold
touch
of
his
knife
at
her
throat.
“My
baby,”
she
screamed,
and
perhaps
the
gods
heard,
for
as
quick
as
that,
Cohollo
was
dead.
Aggo’s
arrow
took
him
under
the
arm,
to
pierce
his
lungs
and
heart.

When
at
last
Daenerys
found
the
strength
to
raise
her
head,
she
saw
the
crowd
dispersing,
the
Dothraki
stealing
silently
back
to
their
tents
and
sleeping
mats.
Some
were
saddling
horses
and
riding
off.
The
sun
had
set.
Fires
burned
throughout
the
khalasar,
great
orange
blazes
that
crackled
with
fury
and
spit
embers
at
the
sky.
She
tried
to
rise,
and
agony
seized
her
and
squeezed
her
like
a
giant’s
fist.
The
breath
went
out
of
her;
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
gasp.
The
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
was
like
a
funeral
dirge.
Inside
the
tent,
the
shadows
whirled.

An
arm
went
under
her
waist,
and
then
Ser
Jorah
was
lifting
her
off
her
feet.
His
face
was
sticky
with
blood,
and
Dany
saw
that
half
his
ear
was
gone.
She
convulsed
in
his
arms
as
the
pain
took
her
again,
and
heard
the
knight
shouting
for
her
handmaids
to
help
him.
Are
they
all
so
afraid?
She
knew
the
answer.
Another
pain
grasped
her,
and
Dany
bit
back
a
scream.
It
felt
as
if
her
son
had
a
knife
in
each
hand,
as
if
he
were
hacking
at
her
to
cut
his
way
out.
“Doreah,
curse
you,”
Ser
Jorah
roared.
“Come
here.
Fetch
the
birthing
women.”

“They
will
not
come.
They
say
she
is
accursed.”

“They’ll
come
or
I’ll
have
their
heads.”

Doreah
wept.
“They
are
gone,
my
lord.”

“The
maegi,”
someone
else
said.
Was
that
Aggo?
“Take
her
to
the
maegi.”

No,
Dany
wanted
to
say,
no,
not
that,
you
mustn’t,
but
when
she
opened
her
mouth,
a
long
wail
of
pain
escaped,
and
the
sweat
broke
over
her
skin.
What
was
wrong
with
them,
couldn’t
they
see?
Inside
the
tent
the
shapes
were
dancing,
circling
the
brazier
and
the
bloody
bath,
dark
against
the
sandsilk,
and
some
did
not
look
human.
She
glimpsed
the
shadow
of
a
great
wolf,
and
another
like
a
man
wreathed
in
flames.

“The
Lamb
Woman
knows
the
secrets
of
the
birthing
bed,”
Irri
said.
“She
said
so,
I
heard
her.”

“Yes,”
Doreah
agreed,
“I
heard
her
too.”

No,
she
shouted,
or
perhaps
she
only
thought
it,
for
no
whisper
of
sound
escaped
her
lips.
She
was
being
carried.
Her
eyes
opened
to
gaze
up
at
a
flat
dead
sky,
black
and
bleak
and
starless.
Please,
no.
The
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
grew
louder,
until
it
filled
the
world.
The
shapes!
she
screamed.
The
dancers!

Ser
Jorah
carried
her
inside
the
tent.





ARYA

The
scent
of
hot
bread
drifting
from
the
shops
along
the
Street
of
Flour
was
sweeter
than
any
perfume
Arya
had
ever
smelled.
She
took
a
deep
breath
and
stepped
closer
to
the
pigeon.
It
was
a
plump
one,
speckled
brown,
busily
pecking
at
a
crust
that
had
fallen
between
two
cobblestones,
but
when
Arya’s
shadow
touched
it,
it
took
to
the
air.

Her
stick
sword
whistled
out
and
caught
it
two
feet
off
the
ground,
and
it
went
down
in
a
flurry
of
brown
feathers.
She
was
on
it
in
the
blink
of
an
eye,
grabbing
a
wing
as
the
pigeon
flapped
and
fluttered.
It
pecked
at
her
hand.
She
grabbed
its
neck
and
twisted
until
she
felt
the
bone
snap.

Compared
with
catching
cats,
pigeons
were
easy.

A
passing
septon
was
looking
at
her
askance.
“Here’s
the
best
place
to
find
pigeon,”
Arya
told
him
as
she
brushed
herself
off
and
picked
up
her
fallen
stick
sword.
“They
come
for
the
crumbs.”
He
hurried
away.

She
tied
the
pigeon
to
her
belt
and
started
down
the
street.
A
man
was
pushing
a
load
of
tarts
by
on
a
two-wheeled
cart;
the
smells
sang
of
blueberries
and
lemons
and
apricots.
Her
stomach
made
a
hollow
rumbly
noise.
“Could
I
have
one?”
she
heard
herself
say.
“A
lemon,
or…
or
any
kind.”

The
pushcart
man
looked
her
up
and
down.
Plainly
he
did
not
like
what
he
saw.
“Three
coppers.”

Arya
tapped
her
wooden
sword
against
the
side
of
her
boot.
“I’ll
trade
you
a
fat
pigeon,”
she
said.

“The
Others
take
your
pigeon,”
the
pushcart
man
said.

The
tarts
were
still
warm
from
the
oven.
The
smells
were
making
her
mouth
water,
but
she
did
not
have
three
coppers…
or
one.
She
gave
the
pushcart
man
a
look,
remembering
what
Syrio
had
told
her
about
seeing.
He
was
short,
with
a
little
round
belly,
and
when
he
moved
he
seemed
to
favor
his
left
leg
a
little.
She
was
just
thinking
that
if
she
snatched
a
tart
and
ran
he
would
never
be
able
to
catch
her
when
he
said,
“You
be
keepin’
your
filthy
hands
off.
The
gold
cloaks
know
how
to
deal
with
thieving
little
gutter
rats,
that
they
do.”

Arya
glanced
warily
behind
her.
Two
of
the
City
Watch
were
standing
at
the
mouth
of
an
alley.
Their
cloaks
hung
almost
to
the
ground,
the
heavy
wool
dyed
a
rich
gold;
their
mail
and
boots
and
gloves
were
black.
One
wore
a
longsword
at
his
hip,
the
other
an
iron
cudgel.
With
a
last
wistful
glance
at
the
tarts,
Arya
edged
back
from
the
cart
and
hurried
off.
The
gold
cloaks
had
not
been
paying
her
any
special
attention,
but
the
sight
of
them
tied
her
stomach
in
knots.
Arya
had
been
staying
as
far
from
the
castle
as
she
could
get,
yet
even
from
a
distance
she
could
see
the
heads
rotting
atop
the
high
red
walls.
Flocks
of
crows
squabbled
noisily
over
each
head,
thick
as
flies.
The
talk
in
Flea
Bottom
was
that
the
gold
cloaks
had
thrown
in
with
the
Lannisters,
their
commander
raised
to
a
lord,
with
lands
on
the
Trident
and
a
seat
on
the
king’s
council.

She
had
also
heard
other
things,
scary
things,
things
that
made
no
sense
to
her.
Some
said
her
father
had
murdered
King
Robert
and
been
slain
in
turn
by
Lord
Renly.
Others
insisted
that
Renly
had
killed
the
king
in
a
drunken
quarrel
between
brothers.
Why
else
should
he
have
fled
in
the
night
like
a
common
thief?
One
story
said
the
king
had
been
killed
by
a
boar
while
hunting,
another
that
he’d
died
eating
a
boar,
stuffing
himself
so
full
that
he’d
ruptured
at
the
table.
No,
the
king
had
died
at
table,
others
said,
but
only
because
Varys
the
Spider
poisoned
him.
No,
it
had
been
the
queen
who
poisoned
him.
No,
he
had
died
of
a
pox.
No,
he
had
choked
on
a
fish
bone.

One
thing
all
the
stories
agreed
on:
King
Robert
was
dead.
The
bells
in
the
seven
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
had
tolled
for
a
day
and
a
night,
the
thunder
of
their
grief
rolling
across
the
city
in
a
bronze
tide.
They
only
rang
the
bells
like
that
for
the
death
of
a
king,
a
tanner’s
boy
told
Arya.

All
she
wanted
was
to
go
home,
but
leaving
King’s
Landing
was
not
so
easy
as
she
had
hoped.
Talk
of
war
was
on
every
lip,
and
gold
cloaks
were
as
thick
on
the
city
walls
as
fleas
on…
well,
her,
for
one.
She
had
been
sleeping
in
Flea
Bottom,
on
rooftops
and
in
stables,
wherever
she
could
find
a
place
to
lie
down,
and
it
hadn’t
taken
her
long
to
learn
that
the
district
was
well
named.

Every
day
since
her
escape
from
the
Red
Keep,
Arya
had
visited
each
of
the
seven
city
gates
in
turn.
The
Dragon
Gate,
the
Lion
Gate,
and
the
Old
Gate
were
closed
and
barred.
The
Mud
Gate
and
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
were
open,
but
only
to
those
who
wanted
to
enter
the
city;
the
guards
let
no
one
out.
Those
who
were
allowed
to
leave
left
by
the
King’s
Gate
or
the
Iron
Gate,
but
Lannister
men-at-arms
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms
manned
the
guard
posts
there.
Spying
down
from
the
roof
of
an
inn
by
the
King’s
Gate,
Arya
saw
them
searching
wagons
and
carriages,
forcing
riders
to
open
their
saddlebags,
and
questioning
everyone
who
tried
to
pass
on
foot.

Sometimes
she
thought
about
swimming
the
river,
but
the
Blackwater
Rush
was
wide
and
deep,
and
everyone
agreed
that
its
currents
were
wicked
and
treacherous.
She
had
no
coin
to
pay
a
ferryman
or
take
passage
on
a
ship.

Her
lord
father
had
taught
her
never
to
steal,
but
it
was
growing
harder
to
remember
why.
If
she
did
not
get
out
soon,
she
would
have
to
take
her
chances
with
the
gold
cloaks.
She
hadn’t
gone
hungry
much
since
she
learned
to
knock
down
birds
with
her
stick
sword,
but
she
feared
so
much
pigeon
was
making
her
sick.
A
couple
she’d
eaten
raw,
before
she
found
Flea
Bottom.

In
the
Bottom
there
were
pot-shops
along
the
alleys
where
huge
tubs
of
stew
had
been
simmering
for
years,
and
you
could
trade
half
your
bird
for
a
heel
of
yesterday’s
bread
and
a
“bowl
o’
brown,”
and
they’d
even
stick
the
other
half
in
the
fire
and
crisp
it
up
for
you,
so
long
as
you
plucked
the
feathers
yourself.
Arya
would
have
given
anything
for
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
lemon
cake,
but
the
brown
wasn’t
so
bad.
It
usually
had
barley
in
it,
and
chunks
of
carrot
and
onion
and
turnip,
and
sometimes
even
apple,
with
a
film
of
grease
swimming
on
top.
Mostly
she
tried
not
to
think
about
the
meat.
Once
she
had
gotten
a
piece
of
fish.

The
only
thing
was,
the
pot-shops
were
never
empty,
and
even
as
she
bolted
down
her
food,
Arya
could
feel
them
watching.
Some
of
them
stared
at
her
boots
or
her
cloak,
and
she
knew
what
they
were
thinking.
With
others,
she
could
almost
feel
their
eyes
crawling
under
her
leathers;
she
didn’t
know
what
they
were
thinking,
and
that
scared
her
even
more.
A
couple
times,
she
was
followed
out
into
the
alleys
and
chased,
but
so
far
no
one
had
been
able
to
catch
her.

The
silver
bracelet
she’d
hoped
to
sell
had
been
stolen
her
first
night
out
of
the
castle,
along
with
her
bundle
of
good
clothes,
snatched
while
she
slept
in
a
burnt-out
house
off
Pig
Alley.
All
they
left
her
was
the
cloak
she
had
been
huddled
in,
the
leathers
on
her
back,
her
wooden
practice
sword…
and
Needle.
She’d
been
lying
on
top
of
Needle,
or
else
it
would
have
been
gone
too;
it
was
worth
more
than
all
the
rest
together.
Since
then
Arya
had
taken
to
walking
around
with
her
cloak
draped
over
her
right
arm,
to
conceal
the
blade
at
her
hip.
The
wooden
sword
she
carried
in
her
left
hand,
out
where
everybody
could
see
it,
to
scare
off
robbers,
but
there
were
men
in
the
pot-shops
who
wouldn’t
have
been
scared
off
if
she’d
had
a
battle-axe.
It
was
enough
to
make
her
lose
her
taste
for
pigeon
and
stale
bread.
Often
as
not,
she
went
to
bed
hungry
rather
than
risk
the
stares.

Once
she
was
outside
the
city,
she
would
find
berries
to
pick,
or
orchards
she
might
raid
for
apples
and
cherries.
Arya
remembered
seeing
some
from
the
kingsroad
on
the
journey
south.
And
she
could
dig
for
roots
in
the
forest,
even
run
down
some
rabbits.
In
the
city,
the
only
things
to
run
down
were
rats
and
cats
and
scrawny
dogs.
The
potshops
would
give
you
a
fistful
of
coppers
for
a
litter
of
pups,
she’d
heard,
but
she
didn’t
like
to
think
about
that.

Down
below
the
Street
of
Flour
was
a
maze
of
twisting
alleys
and
cross
streets.
Arya
scrambled
through
the
crowds,
trying
to
put
distance
between
her
and
the
gold
cloaks.
She
had
learned
to
keep
to
the
center
of
the
street.
Sometimes
she
had
to
dodge
wagons
and
horses,
but
at
least
you
could
see
them
coming.
If
you
walked
near
the
buildings,
people
grabbed
you.
In
some
alleys
you
couldn’t
help
but
brush
against
the
walls;
the
buildings
leaned
in
so
close
they
almost
met.

A
whooping
gang
of
small
children
went
running
past,
chasing
a
rolling
hoop.
Arya
stared
at
them
with
resentment,
remembering
the
times
she’d
played
at
hoops
with
Bran
and
Jon
and
their
baby
brother
Rickon.
She
wondered
how
big
Rickon
had
grown,
and
whether
Bran
was
sad.
She
would
have
given
anything
if
Jon
had
been
here
to
call
her
“little
sister”
and
muss
her
hair.
Not
that
it
needed
mussing.
She’d
seen
her
reflection
in
puddles,
and
she
didn’t
think
hair
got
any
more
mussed
than
hers.

She
had
tried
talking
to
the
children
she
saw
in
the
street,
hoping
to
make
a
friend
who
would
give
her
a
place
to
sleep,
but
she
must
have
talked
wrong
or
something.
The
little
ones
only
looked
at
her
with
quick,
wary
eyes
and
ran
away
if
she
came
too
close.
Their
big
brothers
and
sisters
asked
questions
Arya
couldn’t
answer,
called
her
names,
and
tried
to
steal
from
her.
Only
yesterday,
a
scrawny
barefoot
girl
twice
her
age
had
knocked
her
down
and
tried
to
pull
the
boots
off
her
feet,
but
Arya
gave
her
a
crack
on
her
ear
with
her
stick
sword
that
sent
her
off
sobbing
and
bleeding.

A
gull
wheeled
overhead
as
she
made
her
way
down
the
hill
toward
Flea
Bottom.
Arya
glanced
at
it
thoughtfully,
but
it
was
well
beyond
the
reach
of
her
stick.
It
made
her
think
of
the
sea.
Maybe
that
was
the
way
out.
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
stories
of
boys
who
stowed
away
on
trading
galleys
and
sailed
off
into
all
kinds
of
adventures.
Maybe
Arya
could
do
that
too.
She
decided
to
visit
the
riverfront.
It
was
on
>>>>>>> asd
the
way
to
the
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
wall
and
back
again,
then
stood
it
upright.

She
could
hear
the
sand
shifting
around
inside
as
Elmar
pried
open
the
lid
and
pulled
out
a
chainmail
hauberk.
“Do
you
think
it’s
clean
enough?”
As
Roose
Bolton’s
squire,
it
was
his
task
to
keep
his
mail
shiny
bright.

“You
need
to
shake
out
the
sand.
There’s
still
spots
of
rust.
See?”
She
pointed.
“You’d
best
do
it
again.”

“You
do
it.”
Elmar
could
be
friendly
when
he
needed
help,
but
afterward
he
would
always
remember
that
he
was
a
squire
and
she
was
only
a
serving
girl,
He
liked
to
boast
how
he
was
the
son
of
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing,
not
a
nephew
or
a
bastard
or
a
grandson
but
a
trueborn
son,
and
on
account
of
that
he
was
going
to
marry
a
princess.

Arya
didn’t
care
about
his
precious
princess,
and
didn’t
like
him
giving
her
commands.
“I
have
to
bring
m’lord
water
for
his
basin.
He’s
in
his
bedchamber
being
leeched.
Not
the
regular
black
leeches
but
the
big
pale
ones.”

Elmar’s
eyes
got
as
big
as
boiled
eggs.
Leeches
terrified
him,
especially
the
big
pale
ones
that
looked
like
jelly
until
they
filled
up
with
blood.
“I
forgot,
you’re
too
skinny
to
push
such
a
heavy
barrel.”

“I
forgot,
you’re
stupid.”
Arya
picked
up
the
pail.
“Maybe
you
should
get
leeched
too.
There’s
leeches
in
the
Neck
as
big
as
pigs.”
She
left
him
there
with
his
barrel.

The
lord’s
bedchamber
was
crowded
when
she
entered.
Qyburn
was
in
attendance,
and
dour
Walton
in
his
mail
shirt
and
greaves,
plus
a
dozen
Freys,
all
brothers,
half
brothers,
and
cousins.
Roose
Bolton
lay
abed,
naked.
Leeches
clung
to
the
inside
of
his
arms
and
legs
and
dotted
his
pallid
chest,
long
translucent
things
that
turned
a
glistening
pink
as
they
fed.
Bolton
paid
them
no
more
mind
than
he
did
Arya.

“We
must
not
allow
Lord
Tywin
to
trap
us
here
at
Harrenhal,”
Ser
Aenys
Frey
was
saying
as
Arya
filled
the
washbasin.
A
grey
stooped
giant
of
a
man
with
watery
red
eyes
and
huge
gnarled
hands,
Ser
Aenys
had
brought
fifteen
hundred
Frey
swords
south
to
Harrenhal,
yet
it
often
seemed
as
if
he
were
helpless
to
command
even
his
own
brothers.
“The
castle
is
so
large
it
requires
an
army
to
hold
it,
and
once
surrounded
we
cannot
feed
an
army.
Nor
can
we
hope
to
lay
in
sufficient
supplies.
The
country
is
ash,
the
villages
given
over
to
wolves,
the
harvest
burnt
or
stolen.
Autumn
is
on
us,
yet
there
is
no
food
in
store
and
none
being
planted.
We
live
on
forage,
and
if
the
Lannisters
deny
that
to
us,
we
will
be
down
to
rats
and
shoe
leather
in
a
moon’s
turn.”

“I
do
not
mean
to
be
besieged
here.”
Roose
Bolton’s
voice
was
so
soft
that
men
had
to
strain
to
hear
it,
so
his
chambers
were
always
strangely
hushed.

“What,
then?”
demanded
Ser
Jared
Frey,
who
was
lean,
balding,
and
pockmarked.
“Is
Edmure
Tully
so
drunk
on
his
victory
that
he
thinks
to
give
Lord
Tywin
battle
in
the
open
field?”

If
he
does
he’ll
beat
them,
Arya
thought.
He’ll
beat
them
as
he
did
on
the
Red
Fork,
you’ll
see.
Unnoticed,
she
went
to
stand
by
Qyburn.

“Lord
Tywin
is
many
leagues
from
here,”
Bolton
said
calmly.
“He
has
many
matters
yet
to
settle
at
King’s
Landing.
He
will
not
march
on
Harrenhal
for
some
time.”

Ser
Aenys
shook
his
head
stubbornly.
“You
do
not
know
the
Lannisters
as
we
do,
my
lord.
King
Stannis
thought
that
Lord
Tywin
was
a
thousand
leagues
away
as
well,
and
it
undid
him.”

The
pale
man
in
the
bed
smiled
faintly
as
the
leeches
nursed
of
his
blood.
“I
am
not
a
man
to
be
undone,
ser.”

“Even
if
Riverrun
marshals
all
its
strength
and
the
Young
Wolf
wins
back
from
the
west,
how
can
we
hope
to
match
the
numbers
Lord
Tywin
can
send
against
us?
When
he
comes,
he
will
come
with
far
more
power
than
he
commanded
on
the
Green
Fork.
Highgarden
has
joined
itself
to
Joffrey’s
cause,
I
remind
you!”

“I
had
not
forgotten.”

“I
have
been
Lord
Tywin’s
captive
once,”
said
Ser
Hosteen,
a
husky
man
with
a
square
face
who
was
said
to
be
the
strongest
of
the
Freys.
“I
have
no
wish
to
enjoy
Lannister
hospitality
again.”

Ser
Harys
Haigh,
who
was
a
Frey
on
his
mother’s
side,
nodded
vigorously.
“If
Lord
Tywin
could
defeat
a
seasoned
man
like
Stannis
Baratheon,
what
chance
will
our
boy
king
have
against
him?”
He
looked
round
to
his
brothers
and
cousins
for
support,
and
several
of
them
muttered
agreement.

“Someone
must
have
the
courage
to
say
it,”
Ser
Hosteen
said.
“The
war
is
lost.
King
Robb
must
be
made
to
see
that.”

Roose
Bolton
studied
him
with
pale
eyes.
“His
Grace
has
defeated
the
Lannisters
every
time
he
has
faced
them
in
battle.”

“He
has
lost
the
north,”
insisted
Hosteen
Frey.
“He
has
lost
Winterfell!
His
brothers
are
dead…”

For
a
moment
Arya
forgot
to
breathe.
Dead?
Bran
and
Rickon,
dead?
What
does
he
mean?
What
does
he
mean
about
Winterfell,
Joffrey
could
never
take
Winterfell,
never,
Robb
would
never
let
him.
Then
she
remembered
that
Robb
was
not
at
Winterfell.
He
was
away
in
the
west,
and
Bran
was
crippled,
and
Rickon
only
four.
It
took
all
her
strength
to
remain
still
and
silent,
the
way
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her,
to
stand
there
like
a
stick
of
furniture.
She
felt
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes,
and
willed
them
away.
It’s
not
true,
it
can’t
be
true,
it’s
just
some
Lannister
lie.

“Had
Stannis
won,
all
might
have
been
different,”
Ronel
Rivers
said
wistfully.
He
was
one
of
Lord
Walder’s
bastards.

“Stannis
lost,”
Ser
Hosteen
said
bluntly.
“Wishing
it
were
otherwise
will
not
make
it
so.
King
Robb
must
make
his
peace
with
the
Lannisters.
He
must
put
off
his
crown
and
bend
the
knee,
little
as
he
may
like
it.”

“And
who
will
tell
him
so?”
Roose
Bolton
smiled.
“It
is
a
fine
thing
to
have
so
many
valiant
brothers
in
such
troubled
times.
I
shall
think
on
all
you’ve
said.”

His
smile
was
dismissal.
The
Freys
made
their
courtesies
and
shuffled
out,
leaving
only
Qyburn,
Steelshanks
Walton,
and
Arya.
Lord
Bolton
beckoned
her
closer.
“I
am
bled
sufficiently.
Nan,
you
may
remove
the
leeches.”

“At
once,
my
lord.”
It
was
best
never
to
make
Roose
Bolton
ask
twice.
Arya
wanted
to
ask
him
what
Ser
Hosteen
had
meant
about
Winterfell,
but
she
dared
not.
I’ll
ask
Elmar,
she
thought.
Elmar
will
tell
me.
The
leeches
wriggled
slowly
between
her
fingers
as
she
plucked
them
carefully
from
the
lord’s
body,
their
pale
bodies
moist
to
the
touch
and
distended
with
blood.
They’re
only
leeches,
she
reminded
herself.
If
I
closed
my
hand,
they’d
squish
between
my
fingers.

“There
is
a
letter
from
your
lady
wife.”
Qyburn
pulled
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
sleeve.
Though
he
wore
maester’s
robes,
there
was
no
chain
about
his
neck;
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
lost
it
for
dabbling
in
necromancy.

“You
may
read
it,”
Bolton
said.

The
Lady
Walda
wrote
from
the
Twins
almost
every
day,
but
all
the
letters
were
the
same.
“I
pray
for
you
morn,
noon,
and
night,
my
sweet
lord,”
she
wrote,
“and
count
the
days
until
you
share
my
bed
again.
Return
to
me
soon,
and
I
will
give
you
many
trueborn
sons
to
take
the
place
of
your
dear
Domeric
and
rule
the
Dreadfort
after
you.”
Arya
pictured
a
plump
pink
baby
in
a
cradle,
covered
with
plump
pink
leeches.

She
brought
Lord
Bolton
a
damp
washcloth
to
wipe
down
his
soft
hairless
body.
“I
will
send
a
letter
of
my
own,”
he
told
the
onetime
maester.

“To
the
Lady
Walda?”

“To
Ser
Helman
Tallhart.”

A
rider
from
Ser
Helman
had
come
two
days
past.
Tallhart
men
had
taken
the
castle
of
the
Darrys,
accepting
the
surrender
of
its
Lannister
garrison
after
a
brief
siege.

“Tell
him
to
put
the
captives
to
the
sword
and
the
castle
to
the
torch,
by
command
of
the
king.
Then
he
is
to
join
forces
with
Robett
Glover
and
strike
east
toward
Duskendale.
Those
are
rich
lands,
and
hardly
touched
by
the
fighting.
It
is
time
they
had
a
taste.
Glover
has
lost
a
castle,
and
Tallhart
a
son.
Let
them
take
their
vengeance
on
Duskendale.”

“I
shall
prepare
the
message
for
your
seal,
my
lord.”

Arya
was
glad
to
hear
that
the
castle
of
the
Darrys
would
be
burned.
That
was
where
they’d
brought
her
when
she’d
been
caught
after
her
fight
with
Joffrey,
and
where
the
queen
had
made
her
father
kill
Sansa’s
wolf.
It
deserves
to
burn.
She
wished
that
Robett
Glover
and
Ser
Helman
Tallhart
would
come
back
to
Harrenhal,
though;
they
had
marched
too
quickly,
before
she’d
been
able
to
decide
whether
to
trust
them
with
her
secret.

“I
will
hunt
today,”
Roose
Bolton
announced
as
Qyburn
helped
him
into
a
quilted
jerkin.

“Is
it
safe,
my
lord?”
Qyburn
asked.
“Only
three
days
past,
Septon
Utt’s
men
were
attacked
by
wolves.
They
came
right
into
his
camp,
not
five
yards
from
the
fire,
and
killed
two
horses.”

“It
is
wolves
I
mean
to
hunt.
I
can
scarcely
sleep
at
night
for
the
howling.”
Bolton
buckled
on
his
belt,
adjusting
the
hang
of
sword
and
dagger.
“It’s
said
that
direwolves
once
roamed
the
north
in
great
packs
of
a
hundred
or
more,
and
feared
neither
man
nor
mammoth,
but
that
was
long
ago
and
in
another
land.
It
is
queer
to
see
the
common
wolves
of
the
south
so
bold.”

“Terrible
times
breed
terrible
things,
my
lord.”

Bolton
showed
his
teeth
in
something
that
might
have
been
a
smile.
“Are
these
times
so
terrible,
Maester?”

“Summer
is
gone
and
there
are
four
kings
in
the
realm.”

“One
king
may
be
terrible,
but
four?”
He
shrugged.
“Nan,
my
fur
cloak.”
She
brought
it
to
him.
“My
chambers
will
be
clean
and
orderly
upon
my
return,”
he
told
her
as
she
fastened
it.
“And
tend
to
Lady
Walda’s
letter.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”

The
lord
and
maester
swept
from
the
room,
giving
her
not
so
much
as
a
backward
glance.
When
they
were
gone,
Arya
took
the
letter
and
carried
it
to
the
hearth,
stirring
the
logs
with
a
poker
to
wake
the
flames
anew.
She
watched
the
parchment
twist,
blacken,
and
flare
up.
If
the
Lannisters
hurt
Bran
and
Rickon,
Robb
will
kill
them
every
one.
He’ll
never
bend
the
knee,
never,
never,
never.
He’s
not
afraid
of
any
of
them.
Curls
of
ash
floated
up
the
chimney.
Arya
squatted
beside
the
fire,
watching
them
rise
through
a
veil
of
hot
tears.
If
Winterfell
is
truly
gone,
is
this
my
home
now?
Am
I
still
Arya,
or
only
Nan
the
serving
girl,
for
forever
and
forever
and
forever?

She
spent
the
next
few
hours
tending
to
the
lord’s
chambers.
She
swept
out
the
old
rushes
and
scattered
fresh
sweet-smelling
ones,
laid
a
fresh
fire
in
the
hearth,
changed
the
linens
and
fluffed
the
featherbed,
emptied
the
chamber
pots
down
the
privy
shaft
and
scrubbed
them
out,
carried
an
armload
of
soiled
clothing
to
the
washerwomen,
and
brought
up
a
bowl
of
crisp
autumn
pears
from
the
kitchen.
When
she
was
done
with
the
bedchamber,
she
went
down
half
a
flight
of
stairs
to
do
the
same
in
the
great
solar,
a
spare
drafty
room
as
large
as
the
halls
of
many
a
smaller
castle.
The
candles
were
down
to
stubs,
so
Arya
changed
them
out.
Under
the
windows
was
a
huge
oaken
table
where
the
lord
wrote
his
letters.
She
stacked
the
books,
changed
the
candles,
put
the
quills
and
inks
and
sealing
wax
in
order.

A
large
ragged
sheepskin
was
tossed
across
the
papers.
Arya
had
started
to
roll
it
up
when
the
colors
caught
her
eye:
the
blue
of
lakes
and
rivers,
the
red
dots
where
castles
and
cities
could
be
found,
the
green
of
woods.
She
spread
it
out
instead.
THE
LANDS
OF
THE
TRIDENT,
said
the
ornate
script
beneath
the
map.
The
drawing
showed
everything
from
the
Neck
to
the
Blackwater
Rush.
There’s
Harrenhal
at
the
top
of
the
big
lake,
she
realized,
but
where’s
Riverrun?
Then
she
saw.
It’s
not
so
far…

The
afternoon
was
still
young
by
the
time
she
was
done,
so
Arya
took
herself
off
to
the
godswood.
Her
duties
were
lighter
as
Lord
Bolton’s
cupbearer
than
they
had
been
under
Weese
or
even
Pinkeye,
though
they
required
dressing
like
a
page
and
washing
more
than
she
liked.
The
hunt
would
not
return
for
hours,
so
she
had
a
little
time
for
her
needlework.

She
slashed
at
birch
leaves
till
the
splintery
point
of
the
broken
broomstick
was
green
and
sticky.
“Ser
Gregor,”
she
breathed.
“Dunsen,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.”
She
spun
and
leapt
and
balanced
on
the
balls
of
her
feet,
darting
this
way
and
that,
knocking
pinecones
flying.
“The
Tickler,”
she
called
out
one
time,
“the
Hound,”
the
next.
“Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.”
The
bole
of
an
oak
loomed
before
her,
and
she
lunged
to
drive
her
point
through
it,
grunting
“Joffrey,
Joffrey,
Joffrey.”
Her
arms
and
legs
were
dappled
by
sunlight
and
the
shadows
of
leaves.
A
sheen
of
sweat
covered
her
skin
by
the
time
she
paused.
The
heel
of
her
right
foot
was
bloody
where
she’d
skinned
it,
so
she
stood
one-legged
before
the
heart
tree
and
raised
her
sword
in
salute.
“Valar
morghulis,”
she
told
the
old
gods
of
the
north.
She
liked
how
the
words
sounded
when
she
said
them.

As
Arya
crossed
the
yard
to
the
bathhouse,
she
spied
a
raven
circling
down
toward
the
rookery,
and
wondered
where
it
had
come
from
and
what
message
it
carried.
Might
be
it’s
from
Robb,
come
to
say
it
wasn’t
true
about
Bran
and
Rickon.
She
chewed
on
her
lip,
hoping.
If
I
had
wings
I
could
fly
back
to
Winterfell
and
see
for
myself.
And
if
it
was
true,
I’d
just
fly
away,
fly
up
past
the
moon
and
the
shining
stars,
and
see
all
the
things
in
Old
Nan’s
stories,
dragons
and
sea
monsters
and
the
Titan
of
Braavos,
and
maybe
I
wouldn’t
ever
fly
back
unless
I
wanted
to.

The
hunting
party
returned
near
evenfall
with
nine
dead
wolves.
Seven
were
adults,
big
grey-brown
beasts,
savage
and
powerful,
their
mouths
drawn
back
over
long
yellow
teeth
by
their
dying
snarls.
But
the
other
two
had
only
been
pups.
Lord
Bolton
gave
orders
for
the
skins
to
be
sewn
into
a
blanket
for
his
bed.
“Cubs
still
have
that
soft
fur,
my
lord,”
one
of
his
men
pointed
out.
“Make
you
a
nice
warm
pair
of
gloves.”

Bolton
glanced
up
at
the
banners
waving
above
the
gatehouse
towers.
“As
the
Starks
are
wont
to
remind
us,
winter
is
coming.
Have
it
done.”
When
he
saw
Arya
looking
on,
he
said,
“Nan,
I’ll
want
a
flagon
of
hot
spice
wine,
I
took
a
chill
in
the
woods.
See
that
it
doesn’t
get
cold.
I’m
of
a
mind
to
sup
alone.
Barley
bread,
butter,
and
boar.”

“At
once,
my
lord.”
That
was
always
the
best
thing
to
say.

Hot
Pie
was
making
oatcakes
when
she
entered
the
kitchen.
Three
other
cooks
were
boning
fish,
while
a
spit
boy
turned
a
boar
over
the
flames.
“My
lord
wants
his
supper,
and
hot
spice
wine
to
wash
it
down,”
Arya
announced,
“and
he
doesn’t
want
it
cold.”
One
of
the
cooks
washed
his
hands,
took
out
a
kettle,
and
filled
it
with
a
heavy,
sweet
red.
Hot
Pie
was
told
to
crumble
in
the
spices
as
the
wine
heated.
Arya
went
to
help.

“I
can
do
it,”
he
said
sullenly.
“I
don’t
need
you
to
show
me
how
to
spice
wine.”

He
hates
me
too,
or
else
he’s
scared
of
me.
She
backed
away,
more
sad
than
angry.
When
the
food
was
ready,
the
cooks
covered
it
with
a
silver
cover
and
wrapped
the
flagon
in
a
thick
towel
to
keep
it
warm.
Dusk
was
settling
outside.
On
the
walls
the
crows
muttered
round
the
heads
like
courtiers
round
a
king.
One
of
the
guards
held
the
door
to
Kingspyre.
“Hope
that’s
not
weasel
soup,”
he
jested.

Roose
Bolton
was
seated
by
the
hearth
reading
from
a
thick
leatherbound
book
when
she
entered.
“Light
some
candles,”
he
commanded
her
as
he
turned
a
page.
“It
grows
gloomy
in
here.”

She
placed
the
food
at
his
elbow
and
did
as
he
bid
her,
filling
the
room
with
flickering
light
and
the
scent
of
cloves.
Bolton
turned
a
few
more
pages
with
his
finger,
then
closed
the
book
and
placed
it
carefully
in
the
fire.
He
watched
the
flames
consume
it,
pale
eyes
shining
with
reflected
light.
The
old
dry
leather
went
up
with
a
whoosh,
and
the
yellow
pages
stirred
as
they
burned,
as
if
some
ghost
were
reading
them.
“I
will
have
no
further
need
of
you
tonight,”
he
said,
never
looking
at
her.

She
should
have
gone,
silent
as
a
mouse,
but
something
had
hold
of
her.
“My
lord,”
she
asked,
“will
you
take
me
with
you
when
you
leave
Harrenhal?”

He
turned
to
stare
at
her,
and
from
the
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
his
supper
had
just
spoken
to
him.
“Did
I
give
you
leave
to
question
me,
Nan?”

“No,
my
lord.”
She
lowered
her
eyes.

“You
should
not
have
spoken,
then.
Should
you?”

“No.
My
lord.”

For
a
moment
he
looked
amused.
“I
will
answer
you,
just
this
once.
I
mean
to
give
Harrenhal
to
Lord
Vargo
when
I
return
to
the
north.
You
will
remain
here,
with
him.”

“But
I
don’t—”
=======
Mud
Gate
anyway,
and
she
hadn’t
checked
that
one
today.

The
wharfs
were
oddly
quiet
when
Arya
got
there.
She
spied
another
pair
of
gold
cloaks,
walking
side
by
side
through
the
fish
market,
but
they
never
so
much
as
looked
at
her.
Half
the
stalls
were
empty,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
were
fewer
ships
at
dock
than
she
remembered.
Out
on
the
Blackwater,
three
of
the
king’s
war
galleys
moved
in
formation,
gold-painted
hulls
splitting
the
water
as
their
oars
rose
and
fell.
Arya
watched
them
for
a
bit,
then
began
to
make
her
way
along
the
river.

When
she
saw
the
guardsmen
on
the
third
pier,
in
grey
woolen
cloaks
trimmed
with
white
satin,
her
heart
almost
stopped
in
her
chest.
The
sight
of
Winterfell’s
colors
brought
tears
to
her
eyes.
Behind
them,
a
sleek
three-banked
trading
galley
rocked
at
her
moorings.
Arya
could
not
read
the
name
painted
on
the
hull;
the
words
were
strange,
Myrish,
Braavosi,
perhaps
even
High
Valyrian.
She
grabbed
a
passing
longshoreman
by
the
sleeve.
“Please,”
she
said,
“what
ship
is
this?”

“She’s
the
Wind
Witch,
out
of
Myr,”
the
man
said.

“She’s
still
here,”
Arya
blurted.
The
longshoreman
gave
her
a
queer
look,
shrugged,
and
walked
away.
Arya
ran
toward
the
pier.
The
Wind
Witch
was
the
ship
Father
had
hired
to
take
her
home…
still
waiting!
She’d
imagined
it
had
sailed
ages
ago.

Two
of
the
guardsmen
were
dicing
together
while
the
third
walked
rounds,
his
hand
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
Ashamed
to
let
them
see
her
crying
like
a
baby,
she
stopped
to
rub
at
her
eyes.
Her
eyes
her
eyes
her
eyes,
why
did…

Look
with
your
eyes,
she
heard
Syrio
whisper.

Arya
looked.
She
knew
all
of
her
father’s
men.
The
three
in
the
grey
cloaks
were
strangers.
“You,”
the
one
walking
rounds
called
out.
“What
do
you
want
here,
boy?”
The
other
two
looked
up
from
their
dice.

It
was
all
Arya
could
do
not
to
bolt
and
run,
but
she
knew
that
if
she
did,
they
would
be
after
her
at
once.
She
made
herself
walk
closer.
They
were
looking
for
a
girl,
but
he
thought
she
was
a
boy.
She’d
be
a
boy,
then.
“Want
to
buy
a
pigeon?”
She
showed
him
the
dead
bird.

“Get
out
of
here,”
the
guardsman
said.

Arya
did
as
he
told
her.
She
did
not
have
to
pretend
to
be
frightened.
Behind
her,
the
men
went
back
to
their
dice.

She
could
not
have
said
how
she
got
back
to
Flea
Bottom,
but
she
was
breathing
hard
by
the
time
she
reached
the
narrow
crooked
unpaved
streets
between
the
hills.
The
Bottom
had
a
stench
to
it,
a
stink
of
pigsties
and
stables
and
tanner’s
sheds,
mixed
in
with
the
sour
smell
of
winesinks
and
cheap
whorehouses.
Arya
wound
her
way
through
the
maze
dully.
It
was
not
until
she
caught
a
whiff
of
bubbling
brown
coming
through
a
pot-shop
door
that
she
realized
her
pigeon
was
gone.
It
must
have
slipped
from
her
belt
as
she
ran,
or
someone
had
stolen
it
and
she’d
never
noticed.
For
a
moment
she
wanted
to
cry
again.
She’d
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
the
Street
of
Flour
to
find
another
one
that
plump.

Far
across
the
city,
bells
began
to
ring.

Arya
glanced
up,
listening,
wondering
what
the
ringing
meant
this
time.

“What’s
this
now?”
a
fat
man
called
from
the
pot-shop.

“The
bells
again,
gods
ha’mercy,”
wailed
an
old
woman.

A
red-haired
whore
in
a
wisp
of
painted
silk
pushed
open
a
second-story
window.
“Is
it
the
boy
king
that’s
died
now?”
she
shouted
down,
leaning
out
over
the
street.
“Ah,
that’s
a
boy
for
you,
they
never
last
long.”
As
she
laughed,
a
naked
man
slid
his
arms
around
her
from
behind,
biting
her
neck
and
rubbing
the
heavy
white
breasts
that
hung
loose
beneath
her
shift.

“Stupid
slut,”
the
fat
man
shouted
up.
“The
king’s
not
dead,
that’s
only
summoning
bells.
One
tower
tolling.
When
the
king
dies,
they
ring
every
bell
in
the
city.”

“Here,
quit
your
biting,
or
I’ll
ring
your
bells,”
the
woman
in
the
window
said
to
the
man
behind
her,
pushing
him
off
with
an
elbow.
“So
who
is
it
died,
if
not
the
king?”

“It’s
a
summoning,”
the
fat
man
repeated.

Two
boys
close
to
Arya’s
age
scampered
past,
splashing
through
a
puddle.
The
old
woman
cursed
them,
but
they
kept
right
on
going.
Other
people
were
moving
too,
heading
up
the
hill
to
see
what
the
noise
was
about.
Arya
ran
after
the
slower
boy.
“Where
you
going?”
she
shouted
when
she
was
right
behind
him.
“What’s
happening?”

He
glanced
back
without
slowing.
“The
gold
cloaks
is
carryin’
him
to
the
sept.”

“Who?”
she
yelled,
running
hard.

“The
Hand!
They’ll
be
taking
his
head
off,
Buu
says.”

A
passing
wagon
had
left
a
deep
rut
in
the
street.
The
boy
leapt
over,
but
Arya
never
saw
it.
She
tripped
and
fell,
face
first,
scraping
her
knee
open
on
a
stone
and
smashing
her
fingers
when
her
hands
hit
the
hard-packed
earth.
Needle
tangled
between
her
legs.
She
sobbed
as
she
struggled
to
her
knees.
The
thumb
of
her
left
hand
was
covered
with
blood.
When
she
sucked
on
it,
she
saw
that
half
the
thumbnail
was
gone,
ripped
off
in
her
fall.
Her
hands
throbbed,
and
her
knee
was
all
bloody
too.

“Make
way!”
someone
shouted
from
the
cross
street.
“Make
way
for
my
lords
of
Redwyne!”
It
was
all
Arya
could
do
to
get
out
of
the
road
before
they
ran
her
down,
four
guardsmen
on
huge
horses,
pounding
past
at
a
gallop.
They
wore
checked
cloaks,
blue-and-burgundy.
Behind
them,
two
young
lordlings
rode
side
by
side
on
a
pair
of
chestnut
mares
alike
as
peas
in
a
pod.
Arya
had
seen
them
in
the
bailey
a
hundred
times;
the
Redwyne
twins,
Ser
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber,
homely
youths
with
orange
hair
and
square,
freckled
faces.
Sansa
and
Jeyne
Poole
used
to
call
them
Ser
Horror
and
Ser
Slobber,
and
giggle
whenever
they
caught
sight
of
them.
They
did
not
look
funny
now.

Everyone
was
moving
in
the
same
direction,
all
in
a
hurry
to
see
what
the
ringing
was
all
about.
The
bells
seemed
louder
now,
clanging,
calling.
Arya
joined
the
stream
of
people.
Her
thumb
hurt
so
bad
where
the
nail
had
broken
that
it
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
cry.
She
bit
her
lip
as
she
limped
along,
listening
to
the
excited
voices
around
her.

“—the
King’s
Hand,
Lord
Stark.
They’re
carrying
him
up
to
Baelor’s
Sept.”

“I
heard
he
was
dead.”

“Soon
enough,
soon
enough.
Here,
I
got
me
a
silver
stag
says
they
lop
his
head
off.”

“Past
time,
the
traitor.”
The
man
spat.

Arya
struggled
to
find
a
voice.
“He
never—”
she
started,
but
she
was
only
a
child
and
they
talked
right
over
her.

“Fool!
They
ain’t
neither
going
to
lop
him.
Since
when
do
they
knick
traitors
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept?”

“Well,
they
don’t
mean
to
anoint
him
no
knight.
I
heard
it
was
Stark
killed
old
King
Robert.
Slit
his
throat
in
the
woods,
and
when
they
found
him,
he
stood
there
cool
as
you
please
and
said
it
was
some
old
boar
did
for
His
Grace.”

“Ah,
that’s
not
true,
it
was
his
own
brother
did
him,
that
Renly,
him
with
his
gold
antlers.”

“You
shut
your
lying
mouth,
woman.
You
don’t
know
what
you’re
saying,
his
lordship’s
a
fine
true
man.”

By
the
time
they
reached
the
Street
of
the
Sisters,
they
were
packed
in
shoulder
to
shoulder.
Arya
let
the
human
current
carry
her
along,
up
to
the
top
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
The
white
marble
plaza
was
a
solid
mass
of
people,
all
yammering
excitedly
at
each
other
and
straining
to
get
closer
to
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
The
bells
were
very
loud
here.

Arya
squirmed
through
the
press,
ducking
between
the
legs
of
horses
and
clutching
tight
to
her
sword
stick.
From
the
middle
of
the
crowd,
all
she
could
see
were
arms
and
legs
and
stomachs,
and
the
seven
slender
towers
of
the
sept
looming
overhead.
She
spotted
a
wood
wagon
and
thought
to
climb
up
on
the
back
where
she
might
be
able
to
see,
but
others
had
the
same
idea.
The
teamster
cursed
at
them
and
drove
them
off
with
a
crack
of
his
whip.

Arya
grew
frantic.
Forcing
her
way
to
the
front
of
the
crowd,
she
was
shoved
up
against
the
stone
of
a
plinth.
She
looked
up
at
Baelor
the
Blessed,
the
septon
king.
Sliding
her
stick
sword
through
her
belt,
Arya
began
to
climb.
Her
broken
thumbnail
left
smears
of
blood
on
the
painted
marble,
but
she
made
it
up,
and
wedged
herself
in
between
the
king’s
feet.

That
was
when
she
saw
her
father.

Lord
Eddard
stood
on
the
High
Septon’s
pulpit
outside
the
doors
of
the
sept,
supported
between
two
of
the
gold
cloaks.
He
was
dressed
in
a
rich
grey
velvet
doublet
with
a
white
wolf
sewn
on
the
front
in
beads,
and
a
grey
wool
cloak
trimmed
with
fur,
but
he
was
thinner
than
Arya
had
ever
seen
him,
his
long
face
drawn
with
pain.
He
was
not
standing
so
much
as
being
held
up;
the
cast
over
his
broken
leg
was
grey
and
rotten.

The
High
Septon
himself
stood
behind
him,
a
squat
man,
grey
with
age
and
ponderously
fat,
wearing
long
white
robes
and
an
immense
crown
of
spun
gold
and
crystal
that
wreathed
his
head
with
rainbows
whenever
he
moved.

Clustered
around
the
doors
of
the
sept,
in
front
of
the
raised
marble
pulpit,
were
a
knot
of
knights
and
high
lords.
Joffrey
was
prominent
among
them,
his
raiment
all
crimson,
silk
and
satin
patterned
with
prancing
stags
and
roaring
lions,
a
gold
crown
on
his
head.
His
queen
mother
stood
beside
him
in
a
black
mourning
gown
slashed
with
crimson,
a
veil
of
black
diamonds
in
her
hair.
Arya
recognized
the
Hound,
wearing
a
snowy
white
cloak
over
his
dark
grey
armor,
with
four
of
the
Kingsguard
around
him.
She
saw
Varys
the
eunuch
gliding
among
the
lords
in
soft
slippers
and
a
patterned
damask
robe,
and
she
thought
the
short
man
with
the
silvery
cape
and
pointed
beard
might
be
the
one
who
had
once
fought
a
duel
for
Mother.

And
there
in
their
midst
was
Sansa,
dressed
in
sky-blue
silk,
with
her
long
auburn
hair
washed
and
curled
and
silver
bracelets
on
her
wrists.
Arya
scowled,
wondering
what
her
sister
was
doing
here,
why
she
looked
so
happy.

A
long
line
of
gold-cloaked
spearmen
held
back
the
crowd,
commanded
by
a
stout
man
in
elaborate
armor,
all
black
lacquer
and
gold
filigree.
His
cloak
had
the
metallic
shimmer
of
true
cloth-of-gold.

When
the
bell
ceased
to
toll,
a
quiet
slowly
settled
across
the
great
plaza,
and
her
father
lifted
his
head
and
began
to
speak,
his
voice
so
thin
and
weak
she
could
scarcely
make
him
out.
People
behind
her
began
to
shout
out,
“What?”
and
“Louder!”
The
man
in
the
black-and-gold
armor
stepped
up
behind
Father
and
prodded
him
sharply.
You
leave
him
alone!
Arya
wanted
to
shout,
but
she
knew
no
one
would
listen.
She
chewed
her
lip.

Her
father
raised
his
voice
and
began
again.
“I
am
Eddard
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
said
more
loudly,
his
voice
carrying
across
the
plaza,
“and
I
come
before
you
to
confess
my
treason
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

“No,”
Arya
whimpered.
Below
her,
the
crowd
began
to
scream
and
shout.
Taunts
and
obscenities
filled
the
air.
Sansa
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands.

Her
father
raised
his
voice
still
higher,
straining
to
be
heard.
“I
betrayed
the
faith
of
my
king
and
the
trust
of
my
friend,
Robert,”
he
shouted.
“I
swore
to
defend
and
protect
his
children,
yet
before
his
blood
was
cold,
I
plotted
to
depose
and
murder
his
son
and
seize
the
throne
for
myself.
Let
the
High
Septon
and
Baelor
the
Beloved
and
the
Seven
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
I
say:
Joffrey
Baratheon
is
the
one
true
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne,
and
by
the
grace
of
all
the
gods,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

A
stone
came
sailing
out
of
the
crowd.
Arya
cried
out
as
she
saw
her
father
hit.
The
gold
cloaks
kept
him
from
falling.
Blood
ran
down
his
face
from
a
deep
gash
across
his
forehead.
More
stones
followed.
One
struck
the
guard
to
Father’s
left.
Another
went
clanging
off
the
breastplate
of
the
knight
in
the
black-and-gold
armor.
Two
of
the
Kingsguard
stepped
in
front
of
Joffrey
and
the
queen,
protecting
them
with
their
shields.

Her
hand
slid
beneath
her
cloak
and
found
Needle
in
its
sheath.
She
tightened
her
fingers
around
the
grip,
squeezing
as
hard
as
she
had
ever
squeezed
anything.
Please,
gods,
keep
him
safe,
she
prayed.
Don’t
let
them
hurt
my
father.

The
High
Septon
knelt
before
Joffrey
and
his
mother.
“As
we
sin,
so
do
we
suffer,”
he
intoned,
in
a
deep
swelling
voice
much
louder
than
Father’s.
“This
man
has
confessed
his
crimes
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men,
here
in
this
holy
place.”
Rainbows
danced
around
his
head
as
he
lifted
his
hands
in
entreaty.
“The
gods
are
just,
yet
Blessed
Baelor
taught
us
that
they
are
also
merciful.
What
shall
be
done
with
this
traitor,
Your
Grace?”

A
thousand
voices
were
screaming,
but
Arya
never
heard
them.
Prince
Joffrey…
no,
King
Joffrey…
stepped
out
from
behind
the
shields
of
his
Kingsguard.
“My
mother
bids
me
let
Lord
Eddard
take
the
black,
and
Lady
Sansa
has
begged
mercy
for
her
father.”
He
looked
straight
at
Sansa
then,
and
smiled,
and
for
a
moment
Arya
thought
that
the
gods
had
heard
her
prayer,
until
Joffrey
turned
back
to
the
crowd
and
said,
“But
they
have
the
soft
hearts
of
women.
So
long
as
I
am
your
king,
treason
shall
never
go
unpunished.
Ser
Ilyn,
bring
me
his
head!”

The
crowd
roared,
and
Arya
felt
the
statue
of
Baelor
rock
as
they
surged
against
it.
The
High
Septon
clutched
at
the
king’s
cape,
and
Varys
came
rushing
over
waving
his
arms,
and
even
the
queen
was
saying
something
to
him,
but
Joffrey
shook
his
head.
Lords
and
knights
moved
aside
as
he
stepped
through,
tall
and
fleshless,
a
skeleton
in
iron
mail,
the
King’s
Justice.
Dimly,
as
if
from
far
off,
Arya
heard
her
sister
scream.
Sansa
had
fallen
to
her
knees,
sobbing
hysterically.
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
climbed
the
steps
of
the
pulpit.

Arya
wriggled
between
Baelor’s
feet
and
threw
herself
into
the
crowd,
drawing
Needle.
She
landed
on
a
man
in
a
butcher’s
apron,
knocking
him
to
the
ground.
Immediately
someone
slammed
into
her
back
and
she
almost
went
down
herself.
Bodies
closed
in
around
her,
stumbling
and
pushing,
trampling
on
the
poor
butcher.
Arya
slashed
at
them
with
Needle.

High
atop
the
pulpit,
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
gestured
and
the
knight
in
black-and-gold
gave
a
command.
The
gold
cloaks
flung
Lord
Eddard
to
the
marble,
with
his
head
and
chest
out
over
the
edge.

“Here,
you!”
an
angry
voice
shouted
at
Arya,
but
she
bowled
past,
shoving
people
aside,
squirming
between
them,
slamming
into
anyone
in
her
way.
A
hand
fumbled
at
her
leg
and
she
hacked
at
it,
kicked
at
shins.
A
woman
stumbled
and
Arya
ran
up
her
back,
cutting
to
both
sides,
but
it
was
no
good,
no
good,
there
were
too
many
people,
no
sooner
did
she
make
a
hole
than
it
closed
again.
Someone
buffeted
her
aside.
She
could
still
hear
Sansa
screaming.

Ser
Ilyn
drew
a
two-handed
greatsword
from
the
scabbard
on
his
back.
As
he
lifted
the
blade
above
his
head,
sunlight
seemed
to
ripple
and
dance
down
the
dark
metal,
glinting
off
an
edge
sharper
than
any
razor.
Ice,
she
thought,
he
has
Ice!
Her
tears
streamed
down
her
face,
blinding
her.

And
then
a
hand
shot
out
of
the
press
and
closed
round
her
arm
like
a
wolf
trap,
so
hard
that
Needle
went
flying
from
her
hand.
Arya
was
wrenched
off
her
feet.
She
would
have
fallen
if
he
hadn’t
held
her
up,
as
easy
as
if
she
were
a
doll.
A
face
pressed
close
to
hers,
long
black
hair
and
tangled
beard
and
rotten
teeth.
“Don’t
look!”
a
thick
voice
snarled
at
her.

“I…
I…
I…”
Arya
sobbed.

The
old
man
shook
her
so
hard
her
teeth
rattled.
“Shut
your
mouth
and
close
your
eyes,
boy.”
Dimly,
as
if
from
far
away,
she
heard
a…
a
noise…
a
soft
sighing
sound,
as
if
a
million
people
had
let
out
their
breath
at
once.
The
old
man’s
fingers
dug
into
her
arm,
stiff
as
iron.
“Look
at
me.
Yes,
that’s
the
way
of
it,
at
me.”
Sour
wine
perfumed
his
breath.
“Remember,
boy?”

It
was
the
smell
that
did
it.
Arya
saw
the
matted
greasy
hair,
the
patched,
dusty
black
cloak
that
covered
his
twisted
shoulders,
the
hard
black
eyes
squinting
at
her.
And
she
remembered
the
black
brother
who
had
come
to
visit
her
father.

“Know
me
now,
do
you?
There’s
a
bright
boy.”
He
spat.
“They’re
done
here.
You’ll
be
coming
with
me,
and
you’ll
be
keeping
your
mouth
shut.”
When
she
started
to
reply,
he
shook
her
again,
even
harder.
“Shut,
I
said.”

The
plaza
was
beginning
to
empty.
The
press
dissolved
around
them
as
people
drifted
back
to
their
lives.
But
Arya’s
life
was
gone.
Numb,
she
trailed
along
beside…
Yoren,
yes,
his
name
is
Yoren.
She
did
not
recall
him
finding
Needle,
until
he
handed
the
sword
back
to
her.
“Hope
you
can
use
that,
boy.”

“I’m
not—”
>>>>>>> asd
she
started.

He
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
cut
her
off.
“I
am
not
in
the
habit
of
being
questioned
by
servants,
Nan.
Must
I
have
your
tongue
out?”

He
would
do
it
as
easily
as
another
man
might
cuff
a
dog,
she
knew.
“No,
my
lord.”

“Then
I’ll
hear
no
more
from
you?”

“No,
my
lord.”

“Go,
then.
I
shall
forget
this
insolence.”

Arya
went,
but
not
to
her
bed.
When
she
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
yard,
the
guard
on
the
door
nodded
at
her
and
said,
“Storm
coming.
Smell
the
air?”
The
wind
was
gusting,
flames
swirling
off
the
torches
mounted
atop
the
walls
beside
the
rows
of
heads.
On
her
way
to
the
godswood,
she
passed
the
Wailing
Tower
where
once
she
had
lived
in
fear
of
Weese.
The
Freys
had
taken
it
for
their
own
since
Harrenhal’s
fall.
She
could
hear
angry
voices
coming
from
a
window,
many
men
talking
and
arguing
all
at
once.
Elmar
was
sitting
on
the
steps
outside,
alone.

“What’s
wrong?”
Arya
asked
him
when
she
saw
the
tears
shining
on
his
cheeks.

“My
princess,”
he
sobbed.
“We’ve
been
dishonored,
Aenys
says.
There
was
a
bird
from
the
Twins.
My
lord
father
says
I’ll
need
to
marry
someone
else,
or
be
a
septon.”

A
stupid
princess,
she
thought,
that’s
nothing
to
cry
over.
“My
brothers
might
be
dead,”
she
confided.

Elmar
gave
her
a
scornful
look.
“No
one
cares
about
a
serving
girl’s
brothers.”

It
was
hard
not
to
hit
him
when
he
said
that.
“I
hope
your
princess
dies,”
she
said,
and
ran
off
before
he
could
grab
her.
In
the
godswood
she
found
her
broomstick
sword
where
she
had
left
it,
and
carried
it
to
the
heart
tree.
There
she
knelt.
Red
leaves
rustled.
Red
eyes
peered
inside
her.
The
eyes
of
the
gods.
“Tell
me
what
to
do,
you
gods,”
she
prayed.

For
a
long
moment
there
was
no
sound
but
the
wind
and
the
water
and
the
creak
of
leaf
and
limb.
And
then,
far
far
off,
beyond
the
godswood
and
the
haunted
towers
and
the
immense
stone
walls
of
Harrenhal,
from
somewhere
out
in
the
world,
came
the
long
lonely
howl
of
a
wolf.
Gooseprickles
rose
on
Arya’s
skin,
and
for
an
instant
she
felt
dizzy.
Then,
so
faintly,
it
seemed
as
if
she
heard
her
father’s
voice.
“When
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies,
but
the
pack
survives,”
he
said.

“But
there
is
no
pack,”
she
whispered
to
the
weirwood.
Bran
and
Rickon
were
dead,
the
Lannisters
had
Sansa,
Jon
had
gone
to
the
Wall.
“I’m
not
even
me
now,
I’m
Nan.”

“You
are
Arya
of
Winterfell,
daughter
of
the
north.
You
told
me
you
could
be
strong.
You
have
the
wolf
blood
in
you.”

“The
wolf
blood.”
Arya
remembered
now.
“I’ll
be
as
strong
as
Robb.
I
said
I
would.”
She
took
a
deep
breath,
then
lifted
the
broomstick
in
both
hands
and
brought
it
down
across
her
knee.
It
broke
with
a
loud
crack,
and
she
threw
the
pieces
aside.
I
am
a
direwolf,
and
done
with
wooden
teeth.

That
night
she
lay
in
her
narrow
bed
upon
the
scratchy
straw,
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
living
and
the
dead
whisper
and
argue
as
she
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise.
They
were
the
only
voices
she
trusted
anymore.
She
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
own
breath,
and
the
wolves
as
well,
a
great
pack
of
them
now.
They
are
closer
than
the
one
I
heard
in
the
godswood,
she
thought.
They
are
calling
to
me.

Finally
she
slipped
from
under
the
blanket,
wriggled
into
a
tunic,
and
padded
barefoot
down
the
stairs.
Roose
Bolton
was
a
cautious
man,
and
the
entrance
to
Kingspyre
was
guarded
day
and
night,
so
she
had
to
slip
out
of
a
narrow
cellar
window.
The
yard
was
still,
the
great
castle
lost
in
haunted
dreams.
Above,
the
wind
keened
through
the
Wailing
Tower.

At
the
forge
she
found
the
fires
extinguished
and
the
doors
closed
and
barred.
She
crept
in
a
window,
as
she
had
once
before.
Gendry
shared
a
mattress
with
two
other
apprentice
smiths.
She
crouched
in
the
loft
for
a
long
time
before
her
eyes
adjusted
enough
for
her
to
be
sure
that
he
was
the
one
on
the
end.
Then
she
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
and
pinched
him.
His
eyes
opened.
He
could
not
have
been
very
deeply
asleep.
“Please,”
she
whispered.
She
took
her
hand
off
his
mouth
and
pointed.

For
a
moment
she
did
not
think
he
understood,
but
then
he
slid
out
from
under
the
blankets.
Naked,
he
padded
across
the
room,
shrugged
into
a
loose
roughspun
tunic,
and
climbed
down
from
the
loft
after
her.
The
other
sleepers
did
not
stir.
“What
do
you
want
now?”
Gendry
said
in
a
low
angry
voice.

“A
sword.”

“Blackthumb
keeps
all
the
blades
locked
up,
I
told
you
that
a
hundred
times.
Is
this
for
Lord
Leech?”

“For
me.
Break
the
lock
with
your
hammer.”

“They’ll
break
my
hand,”
he
grumbled.
“Or
worse.”

“Not
if
you
run
off
with
me.”

“Run,
and
they’ll
catch
you
and
kill
you.”

“They’ll
do
you
worse.
Lord
Bolton
is
giving
Harrenhal
to
the
Bloody
Mummers,
he
told
me
so.”

Gendry
pushed
black
hair
out
of
his
eyes.
“So?”

She
looked
right
at
him,
fearless.
“So
when
Vargo
Hoat’s
the
lord,
he’s
going
to
cut
off
the
feet
of
all
the
servants
to
keep
them
from
running
away.
The
smiths
too.”

“That’s
only
a
story,”
he
said
scornfully.

“No,
it’s
true,
I
heard
Lord
Vargo
say
so,”
she
lied.
“He’s
going
to
cut
one
foot
off
everyone.
The
left
one.
Go
to
the
kitchens
and
wake
Hot
Pie,
he’ll
do
what
you
say.
We’ll
need
bread
or
oatcakes
or
something.
You
get
the
swords
and
I’ll
do
the
horses.
We’ll
meet
near
the
postern
in
the
east
wall,
behind
the
Tower
of
Ghosts.
No
one
ever
comes
there.”

“I
know
that
gate.
It’s
guarded,
same
as
the
rest.”

“So?
You
won’t
forget
the
swords?”

“I
never
said
I’d
come.”

“No.
But
if
you
do,
you
won’t
forget
the
swords?”

He
frowned.
“No,”
he
said
at
last.
“I
guess
I
won’t.”

Arya
reentered
Kingspyre
the
same
way
she
had
left
it,
and
stole
up
the
winding
steps
listening
for
footfalls.
In
her
cell,
she
stripped
to
the
skin
and
dressed
herself
carefully,
in
two
layers
of
smallclothes,
warm
stockings,
and
her
cleanest
tunic.
It
was
Lord
Bolton’s
livery.
On
the
breast
was
sewn
his
sigil,
the
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort.
She
tied
her
shoes,
threw
a
wool
cloak
over
her
skinny
shoulders,
and
knotted
it
under
her
throat.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
moved
back
down
the
stairs.
Outside
the
lord’s
solar
she
paused
to
listen
at
the
door,
easing
it
open
slowly
when
she
heard
only
silence.

The
sheepskin
map
was
on
the
table,
beside
the
remains
of
Lord
Bolton’s
supper.
She
rolled
it
up
tight
and
thrust
it
through
her
belt.
He’d
left
his
dagger
on
the
table
as
well,
so
she
took
that
too,
just
in
case
Gendry
lost
his
courage.

A
horse
neighed
softly
as
she
slipped
into
the
darkened
stables.
The
grooms
were
all
asleep.
She
prodded
one
with
her
toe
until
he
sat
up
groggily
and
said,
“Eh?
Whas?”

“Lord
Bolton
requires
three
horses
saddled
and
bridled.”

The
boy
got
to
his
feet,
pushing
straw
from
his
hair.
“Wha,
at
this
hour?
Horses,
you
say?”
He
blinked
at
the
sigil
on
her
tunic.
“Whas
he
want
horses
for,
in
the
dark?”

“Lord
Bolton
is
not
in
the
habit
of
being
questioned
by
servants.”
She
crossed
her
arms.

The
stableboy
was
still
looking
at
the
flayed
man.
He
knew
what
it
meant.
“Three,
you
say?”

“One
two
three.
Hunting
horses.
Fast
and
surefoot.”
Arya
helped
him
with
the
bridles
and
saddles,
so
he
would
not
need
to
wake
any
of
the
others.
She
hoped
they
would
not
hurt
him
afterward,
but
she
knew
they
probably
would.

Leading
the
horses
across
the
castle
was
the
worst
part.
She
stayed
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
wall
whenever
she
could,
so
the
sentries
walking
their
rounds
on
the
ramparts
above
would
have
needed
to
look
almost
straight
down
to
see
her.
And
if
they
do,
what
of
it?
I’m
my
lord’s
own
cupbearer.
It
was
a
chill
dank
autumn
night.
Clouds
were
blowing
in
from
the
west,
hiding
the
stars,
and
the
Wailing
Tower
screamed
mournfully
at
every
gust
of
wind.
It
smells
like
rain.
Arya
did
not
know
whether
that
would
be
good
or
bad
for
their
escape.

No
one
saw
her,
and
she
saw
no
one,
only
a
grey
and
white
cat
creeping
along
atop
the
godswood
wall.
It
stopped
and
spit
at
her,
waking
memories
of
the
Red
Keep
and
her
father
and
Syrio
Forel.
“I
could
catch
you
if
I
wanted,”
she
called
to
it
softly,
“but
I
have
to
go,
cat.”
The
cat
hissed
again
and
ran
off.

The
Tower
of
Ghosts
was
the
most
ruinous
of
Harrenhal’s
five
immense
towers.
It
stood
dark
and
desolate
behind
the
remains
of
a
collapsed
sept
where
only
rats
had
come
to
pray
for
near
three
hundred
years.
It
was
there
she
waited
to
see
if
Gendry
and
Hot
Pie
would
come.
It
seemed
as
though
she
waited
a
long
time.
The
horses
nibbled
at
the
weeds
that
grew
up
between
the
broken
stones
while
the
clouds
swallowed
the
last
of
the
stars.
Arya
took
out
the
dagger
and
sharpened
it
to
keep
her
hands
busy.
Long
smooth
strokes,
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her.
The
sound
calmed
her.

She
heard
them
coming
long
before
she
saw
them.
Hot
Pie
was
breathing
heavily,
and
once
he
stumbled
in
the
dark,
barked
his
shin,
and
cursed
loud
enough
to
wake
half
of
Harrenhal.
Gendry
was
quieter,
but
the
swords
he
was
carrying
rang
together
as
he
moved.
“Here
I
am.”
She
stood.
“Be
quiet
or
they’ll
hear
you.”

The
boys
picked
their
way
toward
her
over
tumbled
stones.
Gendry
was
wearing
oiled
chainmail
under
his
cloak,
she
saw,
and
he
had
his
blacksmith’s
hammer
slung
across
his
back.
Hot
Pie’s
red
round
face
peered
out
from
under
a
hood.
He
had
a
sack
of
bread
dangling
from
his
right
hand
and
a
big
wheel
of
cheese
under
his
left
arm.
“There’s
a
guard
on
that
postern,”
said
Gendry
quietly.
“I
told
you
there
would
be.”

“You
stay
here
with
the
horses,”
said
Arya.
“I’ll
get
rid
of
him.
Come
quick
when
I
call.”

Gendry
nodded.
Hot
Pie
said,
“Hoot
like
an
owl
when
you
want
us
to
come.”

“I’m
not
an
owl,”
said
Arya.
“I’m
a
wolf.
I’ll
howl.”

Alone,
she
slid
through
the
shadow
of
the
Tower
of
Ghosts.
She
walked
fast,
to
keep
ahead
of
her
fear,
and
it
felt
as
though
Syrio
Forel
walked
beside
her,
and
Yoren,
and
Jaqen
H’ghar,
and
Jon
Snow.
She
had
not
taken
the
sword
Gendry
had
brought
her,
not
yet.
For
this
the
dagger
would
be
better.
It
was
good
and
sharp.
This
postern
was
the
least
of
Harrenhal’s
gates,
a
narrow
door
of
stout
oak
studded
with
iron
nails,
set
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
beneath
a
defensive
tower.
Only
one
man
was
set
to
guard
it,
but
she
knew
there
would
be
sentries
up
in
that
tower
as
well,
and
others
nearby
walking
the
walls.
Whatever
happened,
she
must
be
quiet
as
a
shadow.
He
must
not
call
out.
A
few
scattered
raindrops
had
begun
to
fall.
She
felt
one
land
on
her
brow
and
run
slowly
down
her
nose.

She
made
no
effort
to
hide,
but
approached
the
guard
openly,
as
if
Lord
Bolton
himself
had
sent
her.
He
watched
her
come,
curious
as
to
what
might
bring
a
page
here
at
this
black
hour.
When
she
got
closer,
she
saw
that
he
was
a
northman,
very
tall
and
thin,
huddled
in
a
ragged
fur
cloak.
That
was
bad.
She
might
have
been
able
to
trick
a
Frey
or
one
of
the
Brave
Companions,
but
the
Dreadfort
men
had
served
Roose
Bolton
their
whole
life,
and
they
knew
him
better
than
she
did.
If
I
tell
him
I
am
Arya
Stark
and
command
him
to
stand
aside…
No,
she
dare
not.
He
was
a
northman,
but
not
a
Winterfell
man.
He
belonged
to
Roose
Bolton.

When
she
reached
him
she
pushed
back
her
cloak
so
he
would
see
the
flayed
man
on
her
breast.
“Lord
Bolton
sent
me.”

“At
this
hour?
Why
for?”

She
could
see
the
gleam
of
steel
under
the
fur,
and
she
did
not
know
if
she
was
strong
enough
to
drive
the
point
of
the
dagger
through
chainmail.
His
throat,
it
must
be
his
throat,
but
he’s
too
tall,
I’ll
never
reach
it.
For
a
moment
she
did
not
know
what
to
say.
For
a
moment
she
was
a
little
girl
again,
and
scared,
and
the
rain
on
her
face
felt
like
tears.

“He
told
me
to
give
all
his
guards
a
silver
piece,
for
their
good
service.”
The
words
seemed
to
come
out
of
nowhere.

“Silver,
you
say?”
He
did
not
believe
her,
but
he
wanted
to;
silver
was
silver,
after
all.
“Give
it
over,
then.”

Her
fingers
dug
down
beneath
her
tunic
and
came
out
clutching
the
coin
Jaqen
had
given
her.
In
the
dark
the
iron
could
pass
for
tarnished
silver.
She
held
it
out…
and
let
it
slip
through
her
fingers.

Cursing
her
softly,
the
man
went
to
a
knee
to
grope
for
the
coin
in
the
dirt
and
there
was
his
neck
right
in
front
of
her.
Arya
slid
her
dagger
out
and
drew
it
across
his
throat,
as
smooth
as
summer
silk.
His
blood
covered
her
hands
in
a
hot
gush
and
he
tried
to
shout
but
there
was
blood
in
his
mouth
as
well.

“Valar
morghulis,”
she
whispered
as
he
died.

When
he
stopped
moving,
she
picked
up
the
coin.
Outside
the
walls
of
Harrenhal,
a
wolf
howled
long
and
loud.
She
lifted
the
bar,
set
it
aside,
and
pulled
open
the
heavy
oak
door.
By
the
time
Hot
Pie
and
Gendry
came
up
with
the
horses,
the
rain
was
falling
hard.
“You
killed
him!”
Hot
Pie
gasped.

“What
did
you
think
I
would
do?”
Her
fingers
were
sticky
with
blood,
and
the
smell
was
making
her
mare
skittish.
It’s
no
matter,
she
thought,
swinging
up
into
the
saddle.
The
rain
will
wash
them
clean
again.





SANSA

The
throne
room
was
a
sea
of
jewels,
furs,
and
bright
fabrics.
Lords
and
ladies
filled
the
back
of
the
hall
and
stood
beneath
the
high
windows,
jostling
like
fishwives
on
a
dock.

The
denizens
of
Joffrey’s
court
had
striven
to
outdo
each
other
today.
Jalabhar
Xho
was
all
in
feathers,
a
plumage
so
fantastic
and
extravagant
that
he
seemed
like
to
take
flight.
The
High
Septon’s
crystal
crown
fired
rainbows
through
the
air
every
time
he
moved
his
head.
At
the
council
table,
Queen
Cersei
shimmered
in
a
cloth-of-gold
gown
slashed
in
burgundy
velvet,
while
beside
her
Varys
fussed
and
simpered
in
a
lilac
brocade.
Moon
Boy
and
Ser
Dontos
wore
new
suits
of
motley,
clean
as
a
spring
morning.
Even
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughters
looked
pretty
in
matching
gowns
of
turquoise
silk
and
vair,
and
Lord
Gyles
was
coughing
into
a
square
of
scarlet
silk
trimmed
with
golden
lace.
King
Joffrey
sat
above
them
all,
amongst
the
blades
and
barbs
of
the
Iron
Throne.
He
was
in
crimson
samite,
his
black
mantle
studded
with
rubies,
on
his
head
his
heavy
golden
crown.

Squirming
through
a
press
of
knights,
squires,
and
rich
townfolk,
Sansa
reached
the
front
of
the
gallery
just
as
a
blast
of
trumpets
announced
the
entry
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister.

He
rode
his
warhorse
down
the
length
of
the
hall
and
dismounted
before
the
Iron
Throne.
Sansa
had
never
seen
such
armor;
all
burnished
red
steel,
inlaid
with
golden
scrollwork
and
ornamentation.
His
rondels
were
sunbursts,
the
roaring
lion
that
crowned
his
helm
had
ruby
eyes,
and
a
lioness
on
each
shoulder
fastened
a
cloth-of-gold
cloak
so
long
and
heavy
that
it
draped
the
hindquarters
of
his
charger.
Even
the
horse’s
armor
was
gilded,
and
his
bardings
were
shimmering
crimson
silk
emblazoned
with
the
lion
of
Lannister.

The
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
made
such
an
impressive
figure
that
it
was
a
shock
when
his
destrier
dropped
a
load
of
dung
right
at
the
base
of
the
throne.
Joffrey
had
to
step
gingerly
around
it
as
he
descended
to
embrace
his
grandfather
and
proclaim
him
Savior
of
the
City.
Sansa
covered
her
mouth
to
hide
a
nervous
smile.

Joff
made
a
show
of
asking
his
grandfather
to
assume
governance
of
the
realm,
and
Lord
Tywin
solemnly
accepted
the
responsibility,
“until
Your
Grace
does
come
of
age.”
Then
squires
removed
his
armor
and
Joff
fastened
the
Hand’s
chain
of
office
around
his
neck.
Lord
Tywin
took
a
seat
at
the
council
table
beside
the
queen.
After
the
destrier
was
led
off
and
his
homage
removed,
Cersei
nodded
for
the
ceremonies
to
continue.

A
fanfare
of
brazen
trumpets
greeted
each
of
the
heroes
as
he
stepped
between
the
great
oaken
doors.
Heralds
cried
his
name
and
deeds
for
all
to
hear,
and
the
noble
knights
and
highborn
ladies
cheered
as
lustily
as
cutthroats
at
a
cockfight.
Pride
of
place
was
given
to
Mace
Tyrell,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden,
a
once-powerful
man
gone
to
fat,
yet
still
handsome.
His
sons
followed
him
in;
Ser
Loras
and
his
older
brother
Ser
Garlan
the
Gallant.
The
three
dressed
alike,
in
green
velvet
trimmed
with
sable.

The
king
descended
the
throne
once
more
to
greet
them,
a
great
honor.
He
fastened
about
the
throat
of
each
a
chain
of
roses
wrought
in
soft
yellow
gold,
from
which
hung
a
golden
disc
with
the
lion
of
Lannister
picked
out
in
rubies.
“The
roses
support
the
lion,
as
the
might
of
Highgarden
supports
the
realm,”
proclaimed
Joffrey.
“If
there
is
any
boon
you
would
ask
of
me,
ask
and
it
shall
be
yours.”

And
now
it
comes,
thought
Sansa.

“Your
Grace,”
said
Ser
Loras,
“I
beg
the
honor
of
serving
in
your
Kingsguard,
to
defend
you
against
your
enemies.”

Joffrey
drew
the
Knight
of
Flowers
to
his
feet
and
kissed
him
on
his
cheek.
“Done,
brother.”

Lord
Tyrell
bowed
his
head.
“There
is
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
serve
the
King’s
Grace.
If
I
was
deemed
worthy
to
join
your
royal
council,
you
would
find
none
more
loyal
or
true.”

Joff
put
a
hand
on
Lord
Tyrell’s
shoulder
and
kissed
him
when
he
stood.
“Your
wish
is
granted.”

Ser
Garlan
Tyrell,
five
years
senior
to
Ser
Loras,
was
a
taller
bearded
version
of
his
more
famous
younger
brother.
He
was
thicker
about
the
chest
and
broader
at
the
shoulders,
and
though
his
face
was
comely
enough,
he
lacked
Ser
Loras’s
startling
beauty.
“Your
Grace,”
Garlan
said
when
the
king
approached
him,
“I
have
a
maiden
sister,
Margaery,
the
delight
of
our
House.
She
was
wed
to
Renly
Baratheon,
as
you
know,
but
Lord
Renly
went
to
war
before
the
marriage
could
be
consummated,
so
she
remains
innocent.
Margaery
has
heard
tales
of
your
wisdom,
courage,
and
chivalry,
and
has
come
to
love
you
from
afar.
I
beseech
you
to
send
for
her,
to
take
her
hand
in
marriage,
and
to
wed
your
House
to
mine
for
all
time.”

King
Joffrey
made
a
show
of
looking
surprised.
“Ser
Garlan,
your
sister’s
beauty
is
famed
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
I
am
promised
to
another.
A
king
must
keep
his
word.”

Queen
Cersei
got
to
her
feet
in
a
rustle
of
skirts.
“Your
Grace,
in
the
judgment
of
your
small
council,
it
would
be
neither
proper
nor
wise
for
you
to
wed
the
daughter
of
a
man
beheaded
for
treason,
a
girl
whose
brother
is
in
open
rebellion
against
the
throne
even
now.
Sire,
your
councillors
beg
you,
for
the
good
of
your
realm,
set
Sansa
Stark
aside.
The
Lady
Margaery
will
make
you
a
far
more
suitable
queen.”

Like
a
pack
of
trained
dogs,
the
lords
and
ladies
in
the
hall
began
to
shout
their
pleasure.
“Margaery,”
they
called.
“Give
us
Margaery!”
and
“No
traitor
queens!
Tyrell!
Tyrell!”

Joffrey
raised
a
hand.
“I
would
like
to
heed
the
wishes
of
my
people,
Mother,
but
I
took
a
holy
vow.”

The
High
Septon
stepped
forward.
“Your
Grace,
the
gods
hold
bethrothal
solemn,
but
your
father,
King
Robert
of
blessed
memory,
made
this
pact
before
the
Starks
of
Winterfell
had
revealed
their
falseness.
Their
crimes
against
the
realm
have
freed
you
from
any
promise
you
might
have
made.
So
far
as
the
Faith
is
concerned,
there
is
no
valid
marriage
contract
’twixt
you
and
Sansa
Stark.”

A
tumult
of
cheering
filled
the
throne
room,
and
cries
of
“Margaery,
Margaery”
erupted
all
around
her.
Sansa
leaned
forward,
her
hands
tight
around
the
gallery’s
wooden
rail.
She
knew
what
came
next,
but
she
was
still
frightened
of
what
Joffrey
might
say,
afraid
that
he
would
refuse
to
release
her
even
now,
when
his
whole
kingdom
depended
upon
it.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
back
again
on
the
marble
steps
outside
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
waiting
for
her
prince
to
grant
her
father
mercy,
and
instead
hearing
him
command
Ilyn
Payne
to
strike
off
his
head.
Please,
she
prayed
fervently,
make
him
say
it,
make
him
say
it.

Lord
Tywin
was
looking
at
his
grandson.
Joff
gave
him
a
sullen
glance,
shifted
his
feet,
and
helped
Ser
Garlan
Tyrell
to
rise.
“The
gods
are
good.
I
am
free
to
heed
my
heart.
I
will
wed
your
sweet
sister,
and
gladly,
ser.”
He
kissed
Ser
Garlan
on
a
bearded
cheek
as
the
cheers
rose
all
around
them.

Sansa
felt
curiously
light-headed.
I
am
free.
She
could
feel
eyes
upon
her.
I
must
not
smile,
she
reminded
herself.
The
queen
had
warned
her;
no
matter
what
she
felt
inside,
the
face
she
showed
the
world
must
look
distraught.
“I
will
not
have
my
son
humiliated,”
Cersei
said.
“Do
you
hear
me?”

“Yes.
But
if
I’m
not
to
be
queen,
what
will
become
of
me?”

“That
will
need
to
be
determined.
For
the
moment,
you
shall
remain
here
at
court,
as
our
ward.”

“I
want
to
go
home.”

The
queen
was
irritated
by
that.
“You
should
have
learned
by
now,
none
of
us
get
the
things
we
want.”

I
have,
though,
Sansa
thought.
I
am
free
of
Joffrey.
I
will
not
have
to
kiss
him,
nor
give
him
my
maidenhood,
nor
bear
him
children.
Let
Margaery
Tyrell
have
all
that,
poor
girl.

By
the
time
the
outburst
died
down,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden
had
been
seated
at
the
council
table,
and
his
sons
had
joined
the
other
knights
and
lordlings
beneath
the
windows.
Sansa
tried
to
look
forlorn
and
abandoned
as
other
heroes
of
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
were
summoned
forth
to
receive
their
rewards.

Paxter
Redwyne,
Lord
of
the
Arbor,
marched
down
the
length
of
the
hall
flanked
by
his
twin
sons
Horror
and
Slobber,
the
former
limping
from
a
wound
taken
in
the
battle.
After
them
followed
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
in
a
snowy
doublet
with
a
great
tree
worked
upon
the
breast
in
gold
thread;
Lord
Randyll
Tarly,
lean
and
balding,
a
greatsword
across
his
back
in
a
jeweled
scabbard;
Ser
Kevan
Lannister,
a
thickset
balding
man
with
a
close-trimmed
beard;
Ser
Addam
Marbrand,
coppery
hair
streaming
to
his
shoulders;
the
great
western
lords
Lydden,
Crakehall,
and
Brax.

Next
came
four
of
lesser
birth
who
had
distinguished
themselves
in
the
fighting:
the
one-eyed
knight
Ser
Philip
Foote,
who
had
slain
Lord
Bryce
Caron
in
single
combat;
the
freerider
Lothor
Brune,
who’d
cut
his
way
through
half
a
hundred
Fossoway
men-at-arms
to
capture
Ser
Jon
of
the
green
apple
and
kill
Ser
Bryan
and
Ser
Edwyd
of
the
red,
thereby
winning
himself
the
name
Lothor
Apple-Eater;
Willit,
a
grizzled
man-atarms
in
the
service
of
Ser
Harys
Swyft,
who’d
pulled
his
master
from
beneath
his
dying
horse
and
defended
him
against
a
dozen
attackers;
and
a
downy-cheeked
squire
named
Josmyn
Peckledon,
who
had
killed
two
knights,
wounded
a
third,
and
captured
two
more,
though
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
fourteen.
Willit
was
borne
in
on
a
litter,
so
grievous
were
his
wounds.

Ser
Kevan
had
taken
a
seat
beside
his
brother
Lord
Tywin.
When
the
heralds
had
finished
telling
of
each
hero’s
deeds,
he
rose.
“It
is
His
Grace’s
wish
that
these
good
men
be
rewarded
for
their
valor.
By
his
decree,
Ser
Philip
shall
henceforth
be
Lord
Philip
of
House
Foote,
and
to
him
shall
go
all
the
lands,
rights,
and
incomes
of
House
Caron.
Lothor
Brune
to
be
raised
to
the
estate
of
knighthood,
and
granted
land
and
keep
in
the
riverlands
at
war’s
end.
To
Josmyn
Peckledon,
a
sword
and
suit
of
plate,
his
choice
of
any
warhorse
in
the
royal
stables,
and
knighthood
as
soon
as
he
shall
come
of
age.
And
lastly,
for
Goodman
Willit,
a
spear
with
a
silver-banded
haft,
a
hauberk
of
new-forged
ringmail,
and
a
full
helm
with
visor.
Further,
the
goodman’s
sons
shall
be
taken
into
the
service
of
House
Lannister
at
Casterly
Rock,
the
elder
as
a
squire
and
the
younger
as
a
page,
with
the
chance
to
advance
to
knighthood
if
they
serve
loyally
and
well.
To
all
this,
the
King’s
Hand
and
the
small
council
consent.”

The
captains
of
the
king’s
warships
Wildwind,
Prince
Aemon,
and
River
Arrow
were
honored
next,
along
with
some
under
officers
from
Godsgrace,
Lance,
Lady
of
Silk,
and
Ramshead.
As
near
as
Sansa
could
tell,
their
chief
accomplishment
had
been
surviving
the
battle
on
the
river,
a
feat
that
few
enough
could
boast.
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
and
the
masters
of
the
Alchemists’
Guild
received
the
king’s
thanks
as
well,
and
Hallyne
was
raised
to
the
style
of
lord,
though
Sansa
noted
that
neither
lands
nor
castle
accompanied
the
title,
which
made
the
alchemist
no
more
a
true
lord
than
Varys
was.
A
more
significant
lordship
by
far
was
granted
to
Ser
Lancel
Lannister.
Joffrey
awarded
him
the
lands,
castle,
and
rights
of
House
Darry,
whose
last
child
lord
had
perished
during
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands,
“leaving
no
trueborn
heirs
of
lawful
Darry
blood,
but
only
a
bastard
cousin.”

Ser
Lancel
did
not
appear
to
accept
the
title;
the
talk
was,
his
wound
might
cost
him
his
arm
or
even
his
life.
The
Imp
was
said
to
be
dying
as
well,
from
a
terrible
cut
to
the
head.

When
the
herald
called,
“Lord
Petyr
Baelish,”
he
came
forth
dressed
all
in
shades
of
rose
and
plum,
his
cloak
patterned
with
mockingbirds.
She
could
see
him
smiling
as
he
knelt
before
the
Iron
Throne.
He
looks
so
pleased.
Sansa
had
not
heard
of
Littlefinger
doing
anything
especially
heroic
during
the
battle,
but
it
seemed
he
was
to
be
rewarded
all
the
same.

Ser
Kevan
got
back
to
his
feet.
“It
is
the
wish
of
the
King’s
Grace
that
his
loyal
councillor
Petyr
Baelish
be
rewarded
for
faithful
service
to
crown
and
realm.
Be
it
known
that
Lord
Baelish
is
granted
the
castle
of
Harrenhal
with
all
its
attendant
lands
and
incomes,
there
to
make
his
seat
and
rule
henceforth
as
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident.
Petyr
Baelish
and
his
sons
and
grandsons
shall
hold
and
enjoy
these
honors
until
the
end
of
time,
and
all
the
lords
of
the
Trident
shall
do
him
homage
as
their
rightful
liege.
The
King’s
Hand
and
the
small
council
consent.”

On
his
knees,
Littlefinger
raised
his
eyes
to
King
Joffrey.
“I
thank
you
humbly,
Your
Grace.
I
suppose
this
means
I’ll
need
to
see
about
getting
some
sons
and
grandsons.”

Joffrey
laughed,
and
the
court
with
him.
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident,
Sansa
thought,
and
Lord
of
Harrenhal
as
well.
She
did
not
understand
why
that
should
make
him
so
happy;
the
honors
were
as
empty
as
the
title
granted
to
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer.
Harrenhal
was
cursed,
everyone
knew
that,
and
the
Lannisters
did
not
even
hold
it
at
present.
Besides,
the
lords
of
the
Trident
were
sworn
to
Riverrun
and
House
Tully,
and
to
the
King
in
the
North;
they
would
never
accept
Littlefinger
as
their
liege.
Unless
they
are
made
to.
Unless
my
brother
and
my
uncle
and
my
grandfather
are
all
cast
down
and
killed.
The
thought
made
Sansa
anxious,
but
she
told
herself
she
was
being
silly.
Robb
has
beaten
them
every
time.
He’ll
beat
Lord
Baelish
too,
if
he
must.

More
than
six
hundred
new
knights
were
made
that
day.
They
had
held
their
vigil
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
all
through
the
night
and
crossed
the
city
barefoot
that
morning
to
prove
their
humble
hearts.
Now
they
came
forward
dressed
in
shifts
of
undyed
wool
to
receive
their
knighthoods
from
the
Kingsguard.
It
took
a
long
time,
since
only
three
of
the
Brothers
of
the
White
Sword
were
on
hand
to
dub
them.
Mandon
Moore
had
perished
in
the
battle,
the
Hound
had
vanished,
Aerys
Oakheart
was
in
Dorne
with
Princess
Myrcella,
and
Jaime
Lannister
was
Robb’s
captive,
so
the
Kingsguard
had
been
reduced
to
Balon
Swann,
Meryn
Trant,
and
Osmund
Kettleblack.
Once
knighted,
each
man
rose,
buckled
on
his
swordbelt,
and
stood
beneath
the
windows.
Some
had
bloody
feet
from
their
walk
through
the
city,
but
they
stood
tall
and
proud
all
the
same,
it
seemed
to
Sansa.

By
the
time
all
the
new
knights
had
been
given
their
sers
the
hall
was
growing
restive,
and
none
more
so
than
Joffrey.
Some
of
those
in
the
gallery
had
begun
to
slip
quietly
away,
but
the
notables
on
the
floor
were
trapped,
unable
to
depart
without
the
king’s
leave.
Judging
by
the
way
he
was
fidgeting
atop
the
Iron
Throne,
Joff
would
willingly
have
granted
it,
but
the
day’s
work
was
far
from
done.
For
now
the
coin
was
turned
over,
and
the
captives
were
ushered
in.

There
were
great
lords
and
noble
knights
in
that
company
too:
sour
old
Lord
Celtigar,
the
Red
Crab;
Ser
Bonifer
the
Good;
Lord
Estermont,
more
ancient
even
than
Celtigar;
Lord
Varner,
who
hobbled
the
length
of
the
hall
on
a
shattered
knee,
but
would
accept
no
help;
Ser
Mark
Mullendore,
grey-faced,
his
left
arm
gone
to
the
elbow;
fierce
Red
Ronnet
of
Griffin
Roost;
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood;
Lord
Willurn
and
his
sons
Josua
and
Elyas;
Ser
Jon
Fossoway;
Ser
Timon
the
Scrapesword;
Aurane,
the
bastard
of
Driftmark;
Lord
Staedmon,
called
Pennylover;
hundreds
of
others.

Those
who
had
changed
their
allegiance
during
the
battle
needed
only
to
swear
fealty
to
Joffrey,
but
the
ones
who
had
fought
for
Stannis
until
the
bitter
end
were
compelled
to
speak.
Their
words
decided
their
fate.
If
they
begged
forgiveness
for
their
treasons
and
promised
to
serve
loyally
henceforth,
Joffrey
welcomed
them
back
into
the
king’s
peace
and
restored
them
to
all
their
lands
and
rights.
A
handful
remained
defiant,
however.
“Do
not
imagine
this
is
done,
boy,”
warned
one,
the
bastard
son
of
some
Florent
or
other.
“The
Lord
of
Light
protects
King
Stannis,
now
and
always.
All
your
swords
and
all
your
scheming
shall
not
save
you
when
his
hour
comes.”

“Your
hour
is
come
right
now.”
Joffrey
beckoned
to
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
to
take
the
man
out
and
strike
his
head
off.
But
no
sooner
had
that
one
been
dragged
away
than
a
knight
of
solemn
mien
with
a
fiery
heart
on
his
surcoat
shouted
out,
“Stannis
is
the
true
king!
A
monster
sits
the
Iron
Throne,
an
abomination
born
of
incest!”

“Be
silent,”
Ser
Kevan
Lannister
bellowed.

The
knight
raised
his
voice
instead.
“Joffrey
is
the
black
worm
eating
the
heart
of
the
realm!
Darkness
was
his
father,
and
death
his
mother!
Destroy
him
before
he
corrupts
you
all!
Destroy
them
all,
queen
whore
and
king
worm,
vile
dwarf
and
whispering
spider,
the
false
flowers.
Save
yourselves!”
One
of
the
gold
cloaks
knocked
the
man
off
his
feet,
but
he
continued
to
shout.
“The
scouring
fire
will
come!
King
Stannis
will
return!
“

Joffrey
lurched
to
his
feet.
“I’m
king!
Kill
him!
Kill
him
now!
I
command
it.”
He
chopped
down
with
his
hand,
a
furious,
angry
gesture…
and
screeched
in
pain
when
his
arm
brushed
against
one
of
the
sharp
metal
fangs
that
surrounded
him.
The
bright
crimson
samite
of
his
sleeve
turned
a
darker
shade
of
red
as
his
blood
soaked
through
it.
“Mother!”
he
wailed.

With
every
eye
on
the
king,
somehow
the
man
on
the
floor
wrested
a
spear
away
from
one
of
the
gold
cloaks,
and
used
it
to
push
himself
back
to
his
feet.
“The
throne
denies
him!”
he
cried.
“He
is
no
king!”

Cersei
was
running
toward
the
throne,
but
Lord
Tywin
remained
still
as
stone.
He
had
only
to
raise
a
finger,
and
Ser
Meryn
Trant
moved
forward
with
drawn
sword.
The
end
was
quick
and
brutal.
The
gold
cloaks
seized
the
knight
by
the
arms.
“No
king!”
he
cried
again
as
Ser
Meryn
drove
the
point
of
his
longsword
through
his
chest.

Joff
fell
into
his
mother’s
arms.
Three
maesters
came
hurrying
forward,
to
bundle
him
out
through
the
king’s
door.
Then
everyone
began
talking
at
once.
When
the
gold
cloaks
dragged
off
the
dead
man,
he
left
a
trail
of
bright
blood
across
the
stone
floor.
Lord
Baelish
stroked
his
beard
while
Varys
whispered
in
his
ear.
Will
they
dismiss
us
now?
Sansa
wondered.
A
score
of
captives
still
waited,
though
whether
to
pledge
fealty
or
shout
curses,
who
could
say?

Lord
Tywin
rose
to
his
feet.
“We
continue,”
he
said
in
a
clear
strong
voice
that
silenced
the
murmurs.
“Those
who
wish
to
ask
pardon
for
their
treasons
may
do
so.
We
will
have
no
more
follies.”
He
moved
to
the
Iron
Throne
and
there
seated
himself
on
a
step,
a
mere
three
feet
off
the
floor.

The
light
outside
the
windows
was
fading
by
the
time
the
session
drew
to
a
close.
Sansa
felt
limp
with
exhaustion
as
she
made
her
way
down
from
the
gallery.
She
wondered
how
badly
Joffrey
had
cut
himself.
They
say
the
Iron
Throne
can
be
perilous
cruel
to
those
who
were
not
meant
to
sit
it.

Back
in
the
safety
of
her
own
chambers,
she
hugged
a
pillow
to
her
face
to
muffle
a
squeal
of
joy.
Oh,
gods
be
good,
he
did
it,
he
put
me
aside
in
front
of
everyone.
When
a
serving
girl
brought
her
supper,
she
almost
kissed
her.
There
was
hot
bread
and
fresh-churned
butter,
a
thick
beef
soup,
capon
and
carrots,
and
peaches
in
honey.
Even
the
food
tastes
sweeter,
she
thought.

Come
dark,
she
slipped
into
a
cloak
and
left
for
the
godswood.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
was
guarding
the
drawbridge
in
his
white
armor.
Sansa
tried
her
best
to
sound
miserable
as
she
bid
him
a
good
evening.
From
the
way
he
leered
at
her,
she
was
not
sure
she
had
been
wholly
convincing.

Dontos
waited
in
the
leafy
moonlight.
“Why
so
sadface?”
Sansa
asked
him
gaily.
“You
were
there,
you
heard.
Joff
put
me
aside,
he’s
done
with
me,
he’s…”

He
took
her
hand.
“Oh,
Jonquil,
my
poor
Jonquil,
you
do
not
understand.
Done
with
you?
They’ve
scarcely
begun.”

Her
heart
sank.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“The
queen
will
never
let
you
go,
never.
You
are
too
valuable
a
hostage.
And
Joffrey…
sweetling,
he
is
still
king.
If
he
wants
you
in
his
bed,
he
will
have
you,
only
now
it
will
be
bastards
he
plants
in
your
womb
instead
of
trueborn
sons.”

“No,”
Sansa
said,
shocked.
“He
let
me
go,
he…”

Ser
Dontos
planted
a
slobbery
kiss
on
her
ear.
“Be
brave.
I
swore
to
see
you
home,
and
now
I
can.
The
day
has
been
chosen.”

“When?”
Sansa
asked.
“When
will
we
go?”

“The
night
of
Joffrey’s
wedding.
After
the
feast.
All
the
necessary
arrangements
have
been
made.
The
Red
Keep
will
be
full
of
strangers.
Half
the
court
will
be
drunk
and
the
other
half
will
be
helping
Joffrey
bed
his
bride.
For
a
little
while,
you
will
be
forgotten,
and
the
confusion
will
be
our
friend.”

“The
wedding
won’t
be
for
a
moon’s
turn
yet.
Margaery
Tyrell
is
at
Highgarden,
they’ve
only
now
sent
for
her.”

“You’ve
waited
so
long,
be
patient
awhile
longer.
Here,
I
have
something
for
you.”
Ser
Dontos
fumbled
in
his
pouch
and
drew
out
a
silvery
spiderweb,
dangling
it
between
his
thick
fingers.
It
was
a
hair
net
of
fine-spun
silver,
the
strands
so
thin
and
delicate
the
net
seemed
to
weigh
no
more
than
a
breath
of
air
when
Sansa
took
it
in
her
fingers.
Small
gems
were
set
wherever
two
strands
crossed,
so
dark
they
drank
the
moonlight.
“What
stones
are
these?”

“Black
amethysts
from
Asshai.
The
rarest
kind,
a
deep
true
purple
by
daylight.”

“It’s
very
lovely,”
Sansa
said,
thinking,
It
is
a
ship
I
need,
not
a
net
for
my
hair.

“Lovelier
than
you
know,
sweet
child.
It’s
magic,
you
see.
It’s
justice
you
hold.
It’s
vengeance
for
your
father.”
Dontos
leaned
close
and
kissed
her
again.
“It’s
home.”





THEON

Maester
Luwin
came
to
him
when
the
first
scouts
were
seen
outside
the
walls.
“My
lord
prince,”
he
said,
“you
must
yield.”

Theon
stared
at
the
platter
of
oakcakes,
honey,
and
blood
sausage
they’d
brought
him
to
break
his
fast.
Another
sleepless
night
had
left
his
nerves
raw,
and
the
very
sight
of
food
sickened
him.
“There
has
been
no
reply
from
my
uncle?”

“None,”
the
maester
said.
“Nor
from
your
father
on
Pyke.”

“Send
more
birds.”

“It
will
not
serve.
By
the
time
the
birds
reach—”

“Send
them!”
Knocking
the
platter
of
food
aside
with
a
swipe
of
his
arm,
he
pushed
off
the
blankets
and
rose
from
Ned
Stark’s
bed
naked
and
angry.
“Or
do
you
want
me
dead?
Is
that
it,
Luwin?
The
truth
now.”

The
small
grey
man
was
unafraid.
“My
order
serves.”

“Yes,
but
whom?”

“The
realm,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
“and
Winterfell.
Theon,
once
I
taught
you
sums
and
letters,
history
and
warcraft.
And
might
have
taught
you
more,
had
you
wished
to
learn.
I
will
not
claim
to
bear
you
any
great
love,
no,
but
I
cannot
hate
you
either.
Even
if
I
did,
so
long
as
you
hold
Winterfell
I
am
bound
by
oath
to
give
you
counsel.
So
now
I
counsel
you
to
yield.”

Theon
stooped
to
scoop
a
puddled
cloak
off
the
floor,
shook
off
the
rushes,
and
draped
it
over
his
shoulders.
A
fire,
I’ll
have
a
fire,
and
clean
garb.
Where’s
Wex?
I’ll
not
go
to
my
grave
in
dirty
clothes.

“You
have
no
hope
of
holding
here,”
the
maester
went
on.
“If
your
lord
father
meant
to
send
you
aid,
he
would
have
done
so
by
now.
It
is
the
Neck
that
concerns
him.
The
battle
for
the
north
will
be
fought
amidst
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin.”

“That
may
be
so,”
said
Theon.
“And
so
long
as
I
hold
Winterfell,
Ser
Rodrik
and
Stark’s
lords
bannermen
cannot
march
south
to
take
my
uncle
in
the
rear.”
I
am
not
so
innocent
of
warcraft
as
you
think,
old
man.
“I
have
food
enough
to
stand
a
year’s
siege,
if
need
be.”

“There
will
be
no
siege.
Perhaps
they
will
spend
a
day
or
two
fashioning
ladders
and
tying
grapnels
to
the
ends
of
ropes.
But
soon
enough
they
will
come
over
your
walls
in
a
hundred
places
at
once.
You
may
be
able
to
hold
the
keep
for
a
time,
but
the
castle
will
fall
within
the
hour.
You
would
do
better
to
open
your
gates
and
ask
for—”

“—mercy?
I
know
what
kind
of
mercy
they
have
for
me.”

“There
is
a
way.”

“I
am
ironborn,”
Theon
reminded
him.
“I
have
my
own
way.
What
choice
have
they
left
me?
No,
don’t
answer,
I’ve
heard
enough
of
your
counsel.
Go
and
send
those
birds
as
I
commanded,
and
tell
Lorren
I
want
to
see
him.
And
Wex
as
well.
I’ll
have
my
mail
scoured
clean,
and
my
garrison
assembled
in
the
yard.”

For
a
moment
he
thought
the
maester
was
going
to
defy
him.
But
finally
Luwin
bowed
stiffly.
“As
you
command.”

They
made
a
pitifully
small
assembly;
the
ironmen
were
few,
the
yard
large.
“The
northmen
will
be
on
us
before
nightfall,”
he
told
them.
“Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
and
all
the
lords
who
have
come
to
his
call.
I
will
not
run
from
them.
I
took
this
castle
and
I
mean
to
hold
it,
to
live
or
die
as
Prince
of
Winterfell.
But
I
will
not
command
any
man
to
die
with
me.
If
you
leave
now,
before
Ser
Rodrik’s
main
force
is
upon
us,
there’s
still
a
chance
you
may
win
free.”
He
unsheathed
his
longsword
and
drew
a
line
in
the
dirt.
“Those
who
would
stay
and
fight,
step
forward.”

No
one
spoke.
The
men
stood
in
their
mail
and
fur
and
boiled
leather,
as
still
as
if
they
were
made
of
stone.
A
few
exchanged
looks.
Urzen
shuffled
his
feet.
Dykk
Harlaw
hawked
and
spat.
A
finger
of
wind
ruffled
Endehar’s
long
fair
hair.

Theon
felt
as
though
he
were
drowning.
Why
am
I
surprised?
he
thought
bleakly.
His
father
had
forsaken
him,
his
uncles,
his
sister,
even
that
wretched
creature
Reek.
Why
should
his
men
prove
any
more
loyal?
There
was
nothing
to
say,
nothing
to
do.
He
could
only
stand
there
beneath
the
great
grey
walls
and
the
hard
white
sky,
sword
in
hand,
waiting,
waiting…

Wex
was
the
first
to
cross
the
line.
Three
quick
steps
and
he
stood
at
Theon’s
side,
slouching.
Shamed
by
the
boy,
Black
Lorren
followed,
all
scowls.
“Who
else?”
he
demanded.
Red
Rolfe
came
forward.
Kromm.
Werlag.
Tymor
and
his
brothers.
Ulf
the
Ill.
Harrag
Sheepstealer.
Four
Harlaws
and
two
Botleys.
Kenned
the
Whale
was
the
last.
Seventeen
in
all.

Urzen
was
among
those
who
did
not
move,
and
Stygg,
and
every
man
of
the
ten
that
Asha
had
brought
from
Deepwood
Motte.
“Go,
then,”
Theon
told
them.
“Run
to
my
sister.
She’ll
give
you
all
a
warm
welcome,
I
have
no
doubt.”

Stygg
had
the
grace
at
least
to
look
ashamed.
The
rest
moved
off
without
a
word.
Theon
turned
to
the
seventeen
who
remained.
“Back
to
the
walls.
If
the
gods
should
spare
us,
I
shall
remember
every
man
of
you.”

Black
Lorren
stayed
when
the
others
had
gone.
“The
castle
folk
will
turn
on
us
soon
as
the
fight
begins.”

“I
know
that.
What
would
you
have
me
do?”

“Put
them
out,”
said
Lorren.
“Every
one.”

Theon
shook
his
head.
“Is
the
noose
ready?”

“It
is.
You
mean
to
use
it?”

“Do
you
know
a
better
way?”

“Aye.
I’ll
take
my
axe
and
stand
on
that
drawbridge,
and
let
them
come
try
me.
One
at
a
time,
two,
three,
it
makes
no
matter.
None
will
pass
the
moat
while
I
still
draw
breath.”

He
means
to
die,
thought
Theon.
It’s
not
victory
he
wants,
it’s
an
end
worthy
of
a
song.
“We’ll
use
the
noose.”

“As
you
say,”
Lorren
replied,
contempt
in
his
eyes.

Wex
helped
garb
him
for
battle.
Beneath
his
black
surcoat
and
golden
mantle
was
a
shirt
of
well-oiled
ringmail,
and
under
that
a
layer
of
stiff
boiled
leather.
Once
armed
and
armored,
Theon
climbed
the
watchtower
at
the
angle
where
the
eastern
and
southern
walls
came
together
to
have
a
look
at
his
doom.
The
northmen
were
spreading
out
to
encircle
the
castle.
It
was
hard
to
judge
their
numbers.
A
thousand
at
least;
perhaps
twice
that
many.
Against
seventeen.
They’d
brought
catapults
and
scorpions.
He
saw
no
siege
towers
rumbling
up
the
kingsroad,
but
there
was
timber
enough
in
the
wolfswood
to
build
as
many
as
were
required.

Theon
studied
their
banners
through
Maester
Luwin’s
Myrish
lens
tube.
The
Cerwyn
battle-axe
flapped
bravely
wherever
he
looked,
and
there
were
Tallhart
trees
as
well,
and
mermen
from
White
Harbor.
Less
common
were
the
sigils
of
Flint
and
Karstark.
Here
and
there
he
even
saw
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods.
But
no
Glovers,
Asha
saw
to
them,
no
Boltons
from
the
Dreadfort,
no
Umbers
come
down
from
the
shadow
of
the
Wall.
Not
that
they
were
needed.
Soon
enough
the
boy
Cley
Cerwyn
appeared
before
the
gates
carrying
a
peace
banner
on
a
tall
staff,
to
announce
that
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
wished
to
parley
with
Theon
Turncloak.

Turncloak.
The
name
was
bitter
as
bile.
He
had
gone
to
Pyke
to
lead
his
father’s
longships
against
Lannisport,
he
remembered.
“I
shall
be
out
shortly,”
he
shouted
down.
“Alone.”

Black
Lorren
disapproved.
“Only
blood
can
wash
out
blood,”
he
declared.
“Knights
may
keep
their
truces
with
other
knights,
but
they
are
not
so
careful
of
their
honor
when
dealing
with
those
they
deem
outlaw.”

Theon
bristled.
“I
am
the
Prince
of
Winterfell
and
heir
to
the
Iron
Islands.
Now
go
find
the
girl
and
do
as
I
told
you.”

Black
Lorren
gave
him
a
murderous
look.
“Aye,
Prince.”

He’s
turned
against
me
too,
Theon
realized.
Of
late
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
very
stones
of
Winterfell
had
turned
against
him.
If
I
die,
I
die
friendless
and
abandoned.
What
choice
did
that
leave
him,
but
to
live?

He
rode
to
the
gatehouse
with
his
crown
on
his
head.
A
woman
was
drawing
water
from
the
well,
and
Gage
the
cook
stood
in
the
door
of
the
kitchens.
They
hid
their
hatred
behind
sullen
looks
and
faces
blank
as
slate,
yet
he
could
feel
it
all
the
same.

When
the
drawbridge
was
lowered,
a
chill
wind
sighed
across
the
moat.
The
touch
of
it
made
him
shiver.
It
is
the
cold,
nothing
more,
Theon
told
himself,
a
shiver,
not
a
tremble.
Even
brave
men
shiver.
Into
the
teeth
of
that
wind
he
rode,
under
the
portcullis,
over
the
drawbridge.
The
outer
gates
swung
open
to
let
him
pass.
As
he
emerged
beneath
the
walls,
he
could
sense
the
boys
watching
from
the
empty
sockets
where
their
eyes
had
been.

Ser
Rodrik
waited
in
the
market
astride
his
dappled
gelding.
Beside
him,
the
direwolf
of
Stark
flapped
from
a
staff
borne
by
young
Cley
Cerwyn.
They
were
alone
in
the
square,
though
Theon
could
see
archers
on
the
roofs
of
surrounding
houses,
spearmen
to
his
right,
and
to
his
left
a
line
of
mounted
knights
beneath
the
merman-and-trident
of
House
Manderly.
Every
one
of
them
wants
me
dead.
Some
were
boys
he’d
drunk
with,
diced
with,
even
wenched
with,
but
that
would
not
save
him
if
he
fell
into
their
hands.

“Ser
Rodrik.”
Theon
reined
to
a
halt.
“It
grieves
me
that
we
must
meet
as
foes.”

“My
own
grief
is
that
I
must
wait
a
while
to
hang
you.”
The
old
knight
spat
onto
the
muddy
ground.
“Theon
Turncloak.”

“I
am
a
Greyjoy
of
Pyke,”
Theon
reminded
him.
“The
cloak
my
father
swaddled
me
in
bore
a
kraken,
not
a
direwolf.”

“For
ten
years
you
have
been
a
ward
of
Stark.”

“Hostage
and
prisoner,
I
call
it.”

“Then
perhaps
Lord
Eddard
should
have
kept
you
chained
to
a
dungeon
wall.
Instead
he
raised
you
among
his
own
sons,
the
sweet
boys
you
have
butchered,
and
to
my
undying
shame
I
trained
you
in
the
arts
of
war.
Would
that
I
had
thrust
a
sword
through
your
belly
instead
of
placing
one
in
your
hand.”

“I
came
out
to
parley,
not
to
suffer
your
insults.
Say
what
you
have
to
say,
old
man.
What
would
you
have
of
me?”

“Two
things,”
the
old
man
said.
“Winterfell,
and
your
life.
Command
your
men
to
open
the
gates
and
lay
down
their
arms.
Those
who
murdered
no
children
shall
be
free
to
walk
away,
but
you
shall
be
held
for
King
Robb’s
justice.
May
the
gods
take
pity
on
you
when
he
returns.”

“Robb
will
never
look
on
Winterfell
again,”
Theon
promised.
“He
will
break
himself
on
Moat
Cailin,
as
every
southron
army
has
done
for
ten
thousand
years.
We
hold
the
north
now,
ser.”

“You
hold
three
castles,”
replied
Ser
Rodrik,
“and
this
one
I
mean
to
take
back,
Turncloak.”

Theon
ignored
that.
“Here
are
my
terms.
You
have
until
evenfall
to
disperse.
Those
who
swear
fealty
to
Balon
Greyjoy
as
their
king
and
to
myself
as
Prince
of
Winterfell
will
be
confirmed
in
their
rights
and
properties
and
suffer
no
harm.
Those
who
defy
us
will
be
destroyed.”

Young
Cerwyn
was
incredulous.
“Are
you
mad,
Greyjoy?”

Ser
Rodrik
shook
his
head.
“Only
vain,
lad.
Theon
has
always
had
too
lofty
an
opinion
of
himself,
I
fear.”
The
old
man
jabbed
a
finger
at
him.
“Do
not
imagine
that
I
need
wait
for
Robb
to
fight
his
way
up
the
Neck
to
deal
with
the
likes
of
you.
I
have
near
two
thousand
men
with
me…
and
if
the
tales
be
true,
you
have
no
more
than
fifty.”

Seventeen,
in
truth.
Theon
made
himself
smile.
“I
have
something
better
than
men.”
And
he
raised
a
fist
over
his
head,
the
signal
Black
Lorren
had
been
told
to
watch
for.

The
walls
of
Winterfell
were
behind
him,
but
Ser
Rodrik
faced
them
squarely
and
could
not
fail
to
see.
Theon
watched
his
face.
When
his
chin
quivered
under
those
stiff
white
whiskers,
he
knew
just
what
the
old
man
was
seeing.
He
is
not
surprised,
he
thought
with
sadness,
but
the
fear
is
there.

“This
is
craven,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“To
use
a
child
so…
this
is
despicable.”

“Oh,
I
know,”
said
Theon.
“It’s
a
dish
I
tasted
myself,
or
have
you
forgotten?
I
was
ten
when
I
was
taken
from
my
father’s
house,
to
make
certain
he
would
raise
no
more
rebellions.”

“It
is
not
the
same!”

Theon’s
face
was
impassive.
“The
noose
I
wore
was
not
made
of
hempen
rope,
that’s
true
enough,
but
I
felt
it
all
the
same.
And
it
chafed,
Ser
Rodrik.
It
chafed
me
raw.”
He
had
never
quite
realized
that
until
now,
but
as
the
words
came
spilling
out
he
saw
the
truth
of
them.

“No
harm
was
ever
done
you.”

“And
no
harm
will
be
done
your
Beth,
so
long
as
you—”

Ser
Rodrik
never
gave
him
the
chance
to
finish.
“Viper,”
the
knight
declared,
his
face
red
with
rage
beneath
those
white
whiskers.
“I
gave
you
the
chance
to
save
your
men
and
die
with
some
small
shred
of
honor,
Turncloak.
I
should
have
known
that
was
too
much
to
ask
of
a
childkiller.”
His
hand
went
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
“I
ought
cut
you
down
here
and
now
and
put
an
end
to
your
lies
and
deceits.
By
the
gods,
I
should.”

Theon
did
not
fear
a
doddering
old
man,
but
those
watching
archers
and
that
line
of
knights
were
a
different
matter.
If
the
swords
came
out
his
chances
of
getting
back
to
the
castle
alive
were
small
to
none.
“Forswear
your
oath
and
murder
me,
and
you
will
watch
your
little
Beth
strangle
at
the
end
of
a
rope.”

Ser
Rodrik’s
knuckles
had
gone
white,
but
after
a
moment
he
took
his
hand
off
the
swordhilt.
“Truly,
I
have
lived
too
long.”

“I
will
not
disagree,
ser.
Will
you
accept
my
terms?”

“I
have
a
duty
to
Lady
Catelyn
and
House
Stark.”

“And
your
own
House?
Beth
is
the
last
of
your
blood.”

The
old
knight
drew
himself
up
straight.
“I
offer
myself
in
my
daughter’s
place.
Release
her,
and
take
me
as
your
hostage.
Surely
the
castellan
of
Winterfell
is
worth
more
than
a
child.”

“Not
to
me.”
A
valiant
gesture,
old
man,
but
I
am
not
that
great
a
fool.
“Not
to
Lord
Manderly
or
Leobald
Tallhart
either,
I’d
wager.”
Your
sorry
old
skin
is
worth
no
more
to
them
than
any
other
man’s.
“No,
I’ll
keep
the
girl…
and
keep
her
safe,
so
long
as
you
do
as
I’ve
commanded
you.
Her
life
is
in
your
hands.”

“Gods
be
good,
Theon,
how
can
you
do
this?
You
know
I
must
attack,
have
sworn…”

“If
this
host
is
still
in
arms
before
my
gate
when
the
sun
sets,
Beth
will
hang,”
said
Theon.
“Another
hostage
will
follow
her
to
the
grave
at
first
light,
and
another
at
sunset.
Every
dawn
and
every
dusk
will
mean
a
death,
until
you
are
gone.
I
have
no
lack
of
hostages.”
He
did
not
wait
for
a
reply,
but
wheeled
Smiler
around
and
rode
back
toward
the
castle.
He
went
slowly
at
first,
but
the
thought
of
those
archers
at
his
back
soon
drove
him
to
a
canter.
The
small
heads
watched
him
come
from
their
spikes,
their
tarred
and
flayed
faces
looming
larger
with
every
yard;
between
them
stood
little
Beth
Cassel,
noosed
and
crying.
Theon
put
his
heel
into
Smiler
and
broke
into
a
hard
gallop.
Smiler’s
hooves
clattered
on
the
drawbridge,
like
drumbeats.

In
the
yard
he
dismounted
and
handed
his
reins
to
Wex.
“It
may
stay
them,”
he
told
Black
Lorren.
“We’ll
know
by
sunset.
Take
the
girl
in
till
then,
and
keep
her
somewhere
safe.”
Under
the
layers
of
leather,
steel,
and
wool,
he
was
slick
with
sweat.
“I
need
a
cup
of
wine.
A
vat
of
wine
would
do
even
better.”

A
fire
had
been
laid
in
Ned
Stark’s
bedchamber.
Theon
sat
beside
it
and
filled
a
cup
with
a
heavy-bodied
red
from
the
castle
vaults,
a
wine
as
sour
as
his
mood.
They
will
attack,
he
thought
gloomily,
staring
at
the
flames.
Ser
Rodrik
loves
his
daughter,
but
he
is
still
castellan,
and
most
of
all
a
knight.
Had
it
been
Theon
with
a
noose
around
his
neck
and
Lord
Balon
commanding
the
army
without,
the
warhorns
would
already
have
sounded
the
attack,
he
had
no
doubt.
He
should
thank
the
gods
that
Ser
Rodrik
was
not
ironborn.
The
men
of
the
green
lands
were
made
of
softer
stuff,
though
he
was
not
certain
they
would
prove
soft
enough.

If
not,
if
the
old
man
gave
the
command
to
storm
the
castle
regardless,
Winterfell
would
fall;
Theon
entertained
no
delusions
on
that
count.
His
seventeen
might
kill
three,
four,
five
times
their
own
number,
but
in
the
end
they
would
be
overwhelmed.

Theon
stared
at
the
flames
over
the
rim
of
his
wine
goblet,
brooding
on
the
injustice
of
it
all.
“I
rode
beside
Robb
Stark
in
the
Whispering
Wood,”
he
muttered.
He
had
been
frightened
that
night,
but
not
like
this.
It
was
one
thing
to
go
into
battle
surrounded
by
friends,
and
another
to
perish
alone
and
despised.
Mercy,
he
thought
miserably.

When
the
wine
brought
no
solace,
Theon
sent
Wex
to
fetch
his
bow
and
took
himself
to
the
old
inner
ward.
There
he
stood,
loosing
shaft
after
shaft
at
the
archery
butts
until
his
shoulders
ached
and
his
fingers
were
bloody,
pausing
only
long
enough
to
pull
the
arrows
from
the
targets
for
another
round.
I
saved
Bran’s
life
with
this
bow,
he
reminded
himself.
Would
that
I
could
save
my
own.
Women
came
to
the
well,
but
did
not
linger;
whatever
they
saw
on
Theon’s
face
sent
them
away
quickly.

Behind
him
the
broken
tower
stood,
its
summit
as
jagged
as
a
crown
where
fire
had
collapsed
the
upper
stories
long
ago.
As
the
sun
moved,
the
shadow
of
the
tower
moved
as
well,
gradually
lengthening,
a
black
arm
reaching
out
for
Theon
Greyjoy.
By
the
time
the
sun
touched
the
wall,
he
was
in
its
grasp.
If
I
hang
the
girl,
the
northmen
will
attack
at
once,
he
thought
as
he
loosed
a
shaft.
If
I
do
not
hang
her,
they
will
know
my
threats
are
empty.
He
knocked
another
arrow
to
his
bow.
There
is
no
way
out,
none.

“If
you
had
a
hundred
archers
as
good
as
yourself,
you
might
have
a
chance
to
hold
the
castle,”
a
voice
said
softly.

When
he
turned,
Maester
Luwin
was
behind
him.
“Go
away,”
Theon
told
him.
“I
have
had
enough
of
your
counsel.”

“And
life?
Have
you
had
enough
of
that,
my
lord
prince?”

He
raised
the
bow.
“One
more
word
and
I’ll
put
this
shaft
through
your
heart.”

“You
won’t.”

Theon
bent
the
bow,
drawing
the
grey
goose
feathers
back
to
his
cheek.
“Care
to
make
a
wager?”

“I
am
your
last
hope,
Theon.”

I
have
no
hope,
he
thought.
Yet
he
lowered
the
bow
half
an
inch
and
said,
“I
will
not
run.”

“I
do
not
speak
of
running.
Take
the
black.”

“The
Night’s
Watch?”
Theon
let
the
bow
unbend
slowly
and
pointed
the
arrow
at
the
ground.

“Ser
Rodrik
has
served
House
Stark
all
his
life,
and
House
Stark
has
always
been
a
friend
to
the
Watch.
He
will
not
deny
you.
Open
your
gates,
lay
down
your
arms,
accept
his
terms,
and
he
must
let
you
take
the
black.”

A
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
It
meant
no
crown,
no
sons,
no
wife…
but
it
meant
life,
and
life
with
honor.
Ned
Stark’s
own
brother
had
chosen
the
Watch,
and
Jon
Snow
as
well.

I
have
black
garb
aplenty,
once
I
tear
the
krakens
off.
Even
my
horse
is
black.
I
could
rise
high
in
the
Watch—chief
of
rangers,
likely
even
Lord
Commander.
Let
Asha
keep
the
bloody
islands,
they’re
as
dreary
as
she
is.
If
I
served
at
Eastwatch,
I
could
command
my
own
ship,
and
there’s
fine
hunting
beyond
the
Wall.
As
for
women,
what
wildling
woman
wouldn’t
want
a
prince
in
her
bed?
A
slow
smile
crept
across
his
face,
A
black
cloak
can’t
be
turned.
I’d
be
as
good
as
any
man…

“PRINCE
THEON!”
The
sudden
shout
shattered
his
daydream.
Kromm
was
loping
across
the
ward.
“The
northmen—”

He
felt
a
sudden
sick
sense
of
dread.
“Is
it
the
attack?”

Maester
Luwin
clutched
his
arm.
“There’s
still
time.
Raise
a
peace
banner—”

“They’re
fighting,”
Kromm
said
urgently.
“More
men
came
up,
hundreds
of
them,
and
at
first
they
made
to
join
the
others.
But
now
they’ve
fallen
on
them!”

“Is
it
Asha?”
Had
she
come
to
save
him
after
all?

But
Kromm
gave
a
shake
of
his
head.
“No.
These
are
northmen,
I
tell
you.
With
a
bloody
man
on
their
banner.”

The
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort.
Reek
had
belonged
to
the
Bastard
of
Bolton
before
his
capture,
Theon
recalled.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
a
vile
creature
like
him
could
sway
the
Boltons
to
change
their
allegiance,
but
nothing
else
made
sense.
“I’ll
see
this
for
myself,”
Theon
said.

Maester
Luwin
trailed
after
him.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
battlements,
dead
men
and
dying
horses
were
strewn
about
the
market
square
outside
the
gates.
He
saw
no
battle
lines,
only
a
swirling
chaos
of
banners
and
blades.
Shouts
and
screams
rang
through
the
cold
autumn
air.
Ser
Rodrik
seemed
to
have
the
numbers,
but
the
Dreadfort
men
were
better
led,
and
had
taken
the
others
unawares.
Theon
watched
them
charge
and
wheel
and
charge
again,
chopping
the
larger
force
to
bloody
pieces
every
time
they
tried
to
form
up
between
the
houses.
He
could
hear
the
crash
of
iron
axeheads
on
oaken
shields
over
the
terrified
trumpeting
of
a
maimed
horse.
The
inn
was
burning,
he
saw.

Black
Lorren
appeared
beside
him
and
stood
silently
for
a
time.
The
sun
was
low
in
the
west,
painting
the
fields
and
houses
all
a
glowing
red.
A
thin
wavering
cry
of
pain
drifted
over
the
walls,
and
a
warhorn
sounded
off
beyond
the
burning
houses.
Theon
watched
a
wounded
man
drag
himself
painfully
across
the
ground,
smearing
his
life’s
blood
in
the
dirt
as
he
struggled
to
reach
the
well
that
stood
at
the
center
of
the
market
square.
He
died
before
he
got
there.
He
wore
a
leather
jerkin
and
conical
halfhelm,
but
no
badge
to
tell
which
side
he’d
fought
on.

The
crows
came
in
the
blue
dust,
with
the
evening
stars.
“The
Dothraki
believe
the
stars
are
spirits
of
the
valiant
dead,”
Theon
said.
Maester
Luwin
had
told
him
that,
a
long
time
ago.

“Dothraki?”

“The
horselords
across
the
narrow
sea.”

“Oh.
Them.”
Black
Lorren
frowned
through
his
beard.
“Savages
believe
all
manner
of
foolish
things.”

As
the
night
grew
darker
and
the
smoke
spread
it
was
harder
to
make
out
what
was
happening
below,
but
the
din
of
steel
gradually
diminished
to
nothing,
and
the
shouts
and
warhorns
gave
way
to
moans
and
piteous
wailing.
Finally
a
column
of
mounted
men
rode
out
of
the
drifting
smoke.
At
their
head
was
a
knight
in
dark
armor.
His
rounded
helm
gleamed
a
sullen
red,
and
a
pale
pink
cloak
streamed
from
his
shoulders.
Outside
the
main
gate
he
reined
up,
and
one
of
his
men
shouted
for
the
castle
to
open.

“Are
you
friend
or
foe?”
Black
Lorren
bellowed
down.

“Would
a
foe
bring
such
fine
gifts?”
Red
Helm
waved
a
hand,
and
three
corpses
were
dumped
in
front
of
the
gates.
A
torch
was
waved
above
the
bodies,
so
the
defenders
upon
the
walls
might
see
the
faces
of
the
dead.

“The
old
castellan,”
said
Black
Lorren.

“With
Leobald
Tallhart
and
Cley
Cerwyn.”
The
boy
lord
had
taken
an
arrow
in
the
eye,
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
lost
his
left
arm
at
the
elbow.
Maester
Luwin
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
dismay,
turned
away
from
the
battlements,
and
fell
to
his
knees
sick.

“The
great
pig
Manderly
was
too
craven
to
leave
White
Harbor,
or
we
would
have
brought
him
as
well,”
shouted
Red
Helm.

I
am
saved,
Theon
thought.
So
why
did
he
feel
so
empty?
This
was
victory,
sweet
victory,
the
deliverance
he
had
prayed
for.
He
glanced
at
Maester
Luwin.
To
think
how
close
I
came
to
yielding,
and
taking
the
black…

“Open
the
gates
for
our
friends.”
Perhaps
tonight
Theon
would
sleep
without
fear
of
what
his
dreams
might
bring.

The
Dreadfort
men
made
their
way
across
the
moat
and
through
the
inner
gates.
Theon
descended
with
Black
Lorren
and
Maester
Luwin
to
meet
them
in
the
yard.
Pale
red
pennons
trailed
from
the
ends
of
a
few
lances,
but
many
more
carried
battle-axes
and
greatswords
and
shields
hacked
half
to
splinters.
“How
many
men
did
you
lose?”
Theon
asked
Red
Helm
as
he
dismounted.

“Twenty
or
thirty.”
The
torchlight
glittered
off
the
chipped
enamel
of
his
visor.
His
helm
and
gorget
were
wrought
in
the
shape
of
a
man’s
face
and
shoulders,
skinless
and
bloody,
mouth
open
in
a
silent
howl
of
anguish.

“Ser
Rodrik
had
you
five-to-one.”

“Aye,
but
he
thought
us
friends.
A
common
mistake.
When
the
old
fool
gave
me
his
hand,
I
took
half
his
arm
instead.
Then
I
let
him
see
my
face.”
The
man
put
both
hands
to
his
helm
and
lifted
it
off
his
head,
holding
it
in
the
crook
of
his
arm.

“Reek,”
Theon
said,
disquieted.
How
did
a
serving
man
get
such
fine
armor?

The
man
laughed.
“The
wretch
is
dead.”
He
stepped
closer.
“The
girl’s
fault.
If
she
had
not
run
so
far,
his
horse
would
not
have
lamed,
and
we
might
have
been
able
to
flee.
I
gave
him
mine
when
I
saw
the
riders
from
the
ridge.
I
was
done
with
her
by
then,
and
he
liked
to
take
his
turn
while
they
were
still
warm.
I
had
to
pull
him
off
her
and
shove
my
clothes
into
his
hands—calfskin
boots
and
velvet
doublet,
silver-chased
swordbelt,
even
my
sable
cloak.
Ride
for
the
Dreadfort,
I
told
him,
bring
all
the
help
you
can.
Take
my
horse,
he’s
swifter,
and
here,
wear
the
ring
my
father
gave
me,
so
they’ll
know
you
came
from
me.
He’d
learned
better
than
to
question
me.
By
the
time
they
put
that
arrow
through
his
back,
I’d
smeared
myself
with
the
girl’s
filth
and
dressed
in
his
rags.
They
might
have
hanged
me
anyway,
but
it
was
the
only
chance
I
saw.”
He
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth.
“And
now,
my
sweet
prince,
there
was
a
woman
promised
me,
if
I
brought
two
hundred
men.
Well,
I
brought
three
times
as
many,
and
no
green
boys
nor
fieldhands
neither,
but
my
father’s
own
garrison.”

Theon
had
given
his
word.
This
was
not
the
time
to
flinch.
Pay
him
his
pound
of
flesh
and
deal
with
him
later.
“Harrag,”
he
said,
“go
to
the
kennels
and
bring
Palla
out
for…?”

“Ramsay.”
There
was
a
smile
on
his
plump
lips,
but
none
in
those
pale
pale
eyes.
“Snow,
my
wife
called
me
before
she
ate
her
fingers,
but
I
say
Bolton.”
His
smile
curdled.
“So
you’d
offer
me
a
kennel
girl
for
my
good
service,
is
that
the
way
of
it?”

There
was
a
tone
in
his
voice
Theon
did
not
like,
no
more
than
he
liked
the
insolent
way
the
Dreadfort
men
were
looking
at
him.
“She
was
what
was
promised.”

“She
smells
of
dogshit.
I’ve
had
enough
of
bad
smells,
as
it
happens.
I
think
I’ll
have
your
bedwarmer
instead.
What
do
you
call
her?
Kyra?”

“Are
you
mad?”
Theon
said
angrily.
“I’ll
have
you—”

The
Bastard’s
backhand
caught
him
square,
and
his
cheekbone
shattered
with
a
sickening
crunch
beneath
the
lobstered
steel.
The
world
vanished
in
a
red
roar
of
pain.

Sometime
later,
Theon
found
himself
on
the
ground.
He
rolled
onto
his
stomach
and
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
blood.
Close
the
gates!
he
tried
to
shout,
but
it
was
too
late.
The
Dreadfort
men
had
cut
down
Red
Rolfe
and
Kenned,
and
more
were
pouring
through,
a
river
of
mail
and
sharp
swords.
There
was
a
ringing
in
his
ears,
and
horror
all
around
him.
Black
Lorren
had
his
sword
out,
but
there
were
already
four
of
them
pressing
in
on
him.
He
saw
Ulf
go
down
with
a
crossbow
bolt
through
the
belly
as
he
ran
for
the
Great
Hall.
Maester
Luwin
was
trying
to
reach
him
when
a
knight
on
a
warhorse
planted
a
spear
between
his
shoulders,
then
swung
back
to
ride
over
him.
Another
man
whipped
a
torch
round
and
round
his
head
and
then
lofted
it
toward
the
thatched
roof
of
the
stables.
“Save
me
the
Freys,”
the
Bastard
was
shouting
as
the
flames
roared
upward,
“and
burn
the
rest.
Burn
it,
burn
it
all.”

The
last
thing
Theon
Greyjoy
saw
was
Smiler,
kicking
free
of
the
burning
stables
with
his
mane
ablaze,
screaming,
rearing…
=======
shoved
her
into
a
doorway,
thrust
dirty
fingers
through
her
hair,
and
gave
it
a
twist,
yanking
her
head
back.
“—not
a
smart
boy,
that
what
you
mean
to
say?”

He
had
a
knife
in
his
other
hand.

As
the
blade
flashed
toward
her
face,
Arya
threw
herself
backward,
kicking
wildly,
wrenching
her
head
from
side
to
side,
but
he
had
her
by
the
hair,
so
strong,
she
could
feel
her
scalp
tearing,
and
on
her
lips
the
salt
taste
of
tears.





BRAN

The
oldest
were
men
grown,
seventeen
and
eighteen
years
from
the
day
of
their
naming.
One
was
past
twenty.
Most
were
younger,
sixteen
or
less.

Bran
watched
them
from
the
balcony
of
Maester
Luwin’s
turret,
listening
to
them
grunt
and
strain
and
curse
as
they
swung
their
staves
and
wooden
swords.
The
yard
was
alive
to
the
clack
of
wood
on
wood,
punctuated
all
too
often
by
thwacks
and
yowls
of
pain
when
a
blow
struck
leather
or
flesh.
Ser
Rodrik
strode
among
the
boys,
face
reddening
beneath
his
white
whiskers,
muttering
at
them
one
and
all.
Bran
had
never
seen
the
old
knight
look
so
fierce.
“No,”
he
kept
saying.
“No.
No.
No.”

“They
don’t
fight
very
well,”
Bran
said
dubiously.
He
scratched
Summer
idly
behind
the
ears
as
the
direwolf
tore
at
a
haunch
of
meat.
Bones
crunched
between
his
teeth.

“For
a
certainty,”
Maester
Luwin
agreed
with
a
deep
sigh.
The
maester
was
peering
through
his
big
Myrish
lens
tube,
measuring
shadows
and
noting
the
position
of
the
comet
that
hung
low
in
the
morning
sky.
“Yet
given
time…
Ser
Rodrik
has
the
truth
of
it,
we
need
men
to
walk
the
walls.
Your
lord
father
took
the
cream
of
his
guard
to
King’s
Landing,
and
your
brother
took
the
rest,
along
with
all
the
likely
lads
for
leagues
around.
Many
will
not
come
back
to
us,
and
we
must
needs
find
the
men
to
take
their
places.”

Bran
stared
resentfully
at
the
sweating
boys
below.
“If
I
still
had
my
legs,
I
could
beat
them
all.”
He
remembered
the
last
time
he’d
held
a
sword
in
his
hand,
when
the
king
had
come
to
Winterfell.
It
was
only
a
wooden
sword,
yet
he’d
knocked
Prince
Tommen
down
half
a
hundred
times.
“Ser
Rodrik
should
teach
me
to
use
a
poleaxe.
If
I
had
a
poleaxe
with
a
big
long
haft,
Hodor
could
be
my
legs.
We
could
be
a
knight
together.”

“I
think
that…
unlikely,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Bran,
when
a
man
fights,
his
arms
and
legs
and
thoughts
must
be
as
one.”

Below
in
the
yard,
Ser
Rodrik
was
yelling.
“You
fight
like
a
goose.
He
pecks
you
and
you
peck
him
harder.
Parry!
Block
the
blow.
Goose
fighting
will
not
suffice.
If
those
were
real
swords,
the
first
peck
would
take
your
arm
off!”
One
of
the
other
boys
laughed,
and
the
old
knight
rounded
on
him.
“You
laugh.
You.
Now
that
is
gall.
You
fight
like
a
hedgehog…”

“There
was
a
knight
once
who
couldn’t
see,”
Bran
said
stubbornly,
as
Ser
Rodrik
went
on
below.
“Old
Nan
told
me
about
him.
He
had
a
long
staff
with
blades
at
both
ends
and
he
could
spin
it
in
his
hands
and
chop
two
men
at
once.”

“Symeon
Star-Eyes,”
Luwin
said
as
he
marked
numbers
in
a
book.
“When
he
lost
his
eyes,
he
put
star
sapphires
in
the
empty
sockets,
or
so
the
singers
claim.
Bran,
that
is
only
a
story,
like
the
tales
of
Florian
the
Fool.
A
fable
from
the
Age
of
Heroes.”
The
maester
tsked.
“You
must
put
these
dreams
aside,
they
will
only
break
your
heart.”

The
mention
of
dreams
reminded
him.
“I
dreamed
about
the
crow
again
last
night.
The
one
with
three
eyes.
He
flew
into
my
bedchamber
and
told
me
to
come
with
him,
so
I
did.
We
went
down
to
the
crypts.
Father
was
there,
and
we
talked.
He
was
sad.”

“And
why
was
that?”
Luwin
peered
through
his
tube.

“It
was
something
to
do
about
Jon,
I
think.”
The
dream
had
been
deeply
disturbing,
more
so
than
any
of
the
other
crow
dreams.
“Hodor
won’t
go
down
into
the
crypts.”

The
maester
had
only
been
half
listening,
Bran
could
tell.
He
lifted
his
eye
from
the
tube,
blinking.
“Hodor
won’t…”

“Go
down
into
the
crypts.
When
I
woke,
I
told
him
to
take
me
down,
to
see
if
Father
was
truly
there.
At
first
he
didn’t
know
what
I
was
saying,
but
I
got
him
to
the
steps
by
telling
him
to
go
here
and
go
there,
only
then
he
wouldn’t
go
down.
He
just
stood
on
the
top
step
and
said
‘Hodor,’
like
he
was
scared
of
the
dark,
but
I
had
a
torch.
It
made
me
so
mad
I
almost
gave
him
a
swat
in
the
head,
like
Old
Nan
is
always
doing.”
He
saw
the
way
the
maester
was
frowning
and
hurriedly
added,
“I
didn’t,
though.”

“Good.
Hodor
is
a
man,
not
a
mule
to
be
beaten.”

“In
the
dream
I
flew
down
with
the
crow,
but
I
can’t
do
that
when
I’m
awake,”
Bran
explained.

“Why
would
you
want
to
go
down
to
the
crypts?”

“I
told
you.
To
look
for
Father.”

The
maester
tugged
at
the
chain
around
his
neck,
as
he
often
did
when
he
was
uncomfortable.
“Bran,
sweet
child,
one
day
Lord
Eddard
will
sit
below
in
stone,
beside
his
father
and
his
father’s
father
and
all
the
Starks
back
to
the
old
Kings
in
the
North…
but
that
will
not
be
for
many
years,
gods
be
good.
Your
father
is
a
prisoner
of
the
queen
in
King’s
Landing.
You
will
not
find
him
in
the
crypts.”

“He
was
there
last
night.
I
talked
to
him.”

“Stubborn
boy,”
the
maester
sighed,
setting
his
book
aside.
“Would
you
like
to
go
see?”

“I
can’t.
Hodor
won’t
go,
and
the
steps
are
too
narrow
and
twisty
for
Dancer.”

“I
believe
I
can
solve
that
difficulty.”

In
place
of
Hodor,
the
wildling
woman
Osha
was
summoned.
She
was
tall
and
tough
and
uncomplaining,
willing
to
go
wherever
she
was
commanded.
“I
lived
my
life
beyond
the
Wall,
a
hole
in
the
ground
won’t
fret
me
none,
m’lords,”
she
said.

“Summer,
come,”
Bran
called
as
she
lifted
him
in
wiry-strong
arms.
The
direwolf
left
his
bone
and
followed
as
Osha
carried
Bran
across
the
yard
and
down
the
spiral
steps
to
the
cold
vault
under
the
earth.
Maester
Luwin
went
ahead
with
a
torch.
Bran
did
not
even
mind—too
badly—that
she
carried
him
in
her
arms
and
not
on
her
back.
Ser
Rodrik
had
ordered
Osha’s
chain
struck
off,
since
she
had
served
faithfully
and
well
since
she
had
been
at
Winterfell.
She
still
wore
the
heavy
iron
shackles
around
her
ankles—a
sign
that
she
was
not
yet
wholly
trusted—but
they
did
not
hinder
her
sure
strides
down
the
steps.

Bran
could
not
recall
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
the
crypts.
It
had
been
before,
for
certain.
When
he
was
little,
he
used
to
play
down
here
with
Robb
and
Jon
and
his
sisters.

He
wished
they
were
here
now;
the
vault
might
not
have
seemed
so
dark
and
scary.
Summer
stalked
out
in
the
echoing
gloom,
then
stopped,
lifted
his
head,
and
sniffed
the
chill
dead
air.
He
bared
his
teeth
and
crept
backward,
eyes
glowing
golden
in
the
light
of
the
maester’s
torch.
Even
Osha,
hard
as
old
iron,
seemed
uncomfortable.
“Grim
folk,
by
the
look
of
them,”
she
said
as
she
eyed
the
long
row
of
granite
Starks
on
their
stone
thrones.

“They
were
the
Kings
of
Winter,”
Bran
whispered.
Somehow
it
felt
wrong
to
talk
too
loudly
in
this
place.

Osha
smiled.
“Winter’s
got
no
king.
If
you’d
seen
it,
you’d
know
that,
summer
boy.”

“They
were
the
Kings
in
the
North
for
thousands
of
years,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
lifting
the
torch
high
so
the
light
shone
on
the
stone
faces.
Some
were
hairy
and
bearded,
shaggy
men
fierce
as
the
wolves
that
crouched
by
their
feet.
Others
were
shaved
clean,
their
features
gaunt
and
sharp-edged
as
the
iron
longswords
across
their
laps.
“Hard
men
for
a
hard
time.
Come.”
He
strode
briskly
down
the
vault,
past
the
procession
of
stone
pillars
and
the
endless
carved
figures.
A
tongue
of
flame
trailed
back
from
the
upraised
torch
as
he
went.

The
vault
was
cavernous,
longer
than
Winterfell
itself,
and
Jon
had
told
him
once
that
there
were
other
levels
underneath,
vaults
even
deeper
and
darker
where
the
older
kings
were
buried.
It
would
not
do
to
lose
the
light.
Summer
refused
to
move
from
the
steps,
even
when
Osha
followed
the
torch,
Bran
in
her
arms.

“Do
you
recall
your
history,
Bran?”
the
maester
said
as
they
walked.
“Tell
Osha
who
they
were
and
what
they
did,
if
you
can.”

He
looked
at
the
passing
faces
and
the
tales
came
back
to
him.
The
maester
had
told
him
the
stories,
and
Old
Nan
had
made
them
come
alive.
“That
one
is
Jon
Stark.
When
the
sea
raiders
landed
in
the
east,
he
drove
them
out
and
built
the
castle
at
White
Harbor.
His
son
was
Rickard
Stark,
not
my
father’s
father
but
another
Rickard,
he
took
the
Neck
away
from
the
Marsh
King
and
married
his
daughter.
Theon
Stark’s
the
real
thin
one
with
the
long
hair
and
the
skinny
beard.
They
called
him
the
‘Hungry
Wolf,’
because
he
was
always
at
war.
That’s
a
Brandon,
the
tall
one
with
the
dreamy
face,
he
was
Brandon
the
Shipwright,
because
he
loved
the
sea.
His
tomb
is
empty.
He
tried
to
sail
west
across
the
Sunset
Sea
and
was
never
seen
again.
His
son
was
Brandon
the
Burner,
because
he
put
the
torch
to
all
his
father’s
ships
in
grief.
There’s
Rodrik
Stark,
who
won
Bear
Island
in
a
wrestling
match
and
gave
it
to
the
Mormonts.
And
that’s
Torrhen
Stark,
the
King
Who
Knelt.
He
was
the
last
King
in
the
North
and
the
first
Lord
of
Winterfell,
after
he
yielded
to
Aegon
the
Conqueror.
Oh,
there,
he’s
Cregan
Stark.
He
fought
with
Prince
Aemon
once,
and
the
Dragonknight
said
he’d
never
faced
a
finer
swordsman.”
They
were
almost
at
the
end
now,
and
Bran
felt
a
sadness
creeping
over
him.
“And
there’s
my
grandfather,
Lord
Rickard,
who
was
beheaded
by
Mad
King
Aerys.
His
daughter
Lyanna
and
his
son
Brandon
are
in
the
tombs
beside
him.
Not
me,
another
Brandon,
my
father’s
brother.
They’re
not
supposed
to
have
statues,
that’s
only
for
the
lords
and
the
kings,
but
my
father
loved
them
so
much
he
had
them
done.”

“The
maid’s
a
fair
one,”
Osha
said.

“Robert
was
betrothed
to
marry
her,
but
Prince
Rhaegar
carried
her
off
and
raped
her,”
Bran
explained.
“Robert
fought
a
war
to
win
her
back.
He
killed
Rhaegar
on
the
Trident
with
his
hammer,
but
Lyanna
died
and
he
never
got
her
back
at
all.”

“A
sad
tale,”
said
Osha,
“but
those
empty
holes
are
sadder.”

“Lord
Eddard’s
tomb,
for
when
his
time
comes,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Is
this
where
you
saw
your
father
in
your
dream,
Bran?”

“Yes.”
The
memory
made
him
shiver.
He
looked
around
the
vault
uneasily,
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
neck
bristling.
Had
he
heard
a
noise?
Was
there
someone
here?

Maester
Luwin
stepped
toward
the
open
sepulchre,
torch
in
hand.
“As
you
see,
he’s
not
here.
Nor
will
he
be,
for
many
a
year.
Dreams
are
only
dreams,
child.”
He
thrust
his
arm
into
the
blackness
inside
the
tomb,
as
into
the
mouth
of
some
great
beast.
“Do
you
see?
It’s
quite
empt—”

The
darkness
sprang
at
him,
snarling.

Bran
saw
eyes
like
green
fire,
a
flash
of
teeth,
fur
as
black
as
the
pit
around
them.
Maester
Luwin
yelled
and
threw
up
his
hands.
The
torch
went
flying
from
his
fingers,
caromed
off
the
stone
face
of
Brandon
Stark,
and
tumbled
to
the
statue’s
feet,
the
flames
licking
up
his
legs.
In
the
drunken
shifting
torchlight,
they
saw
Luwin
struggling
with
the
direwolf,
beating
at
his
muzzle
with
one
hand
while
the
jaws
closed
on
the
other.

“Summer!”
Bran
screamed.

And
Summer
came,
shooting
from
the
dimness
behind
them,
a
leaping
shadow.
He
slammed
into
Shaggydog
and
knocked
him
back,
and
the
two
direwolves
rolled
over
and
over
in
a
tangle
of
grey
and
black
fur,
snapping
and
biting
at
each
other,
while
Maester
Luwin
struggled
to
his
knees,
his
arm
torn
and
bloody.
Osha
propped
Bran
up
against
Lord
Rickard’s
stone
wolf
as
she
hurried
to
assist
the
maester.
In
the
light
of
the
guttering
torch,
shadow
wolves
twenty
feet
tall
fought
on
the
wall
and
roof.

“Shaggy,”
a
small
voice
called.
When
Bran
looked
up,
his
little
brother
was
standing
in
the
mouth
of
Father’s
tomb.
With
one
final
snap
at
Summer’s
face,
Shaggydog
broke
off
and
bounded
to
Rickon’s
side.
“You
let
my
father
be,”
Rickon
warned
Luwin.
“You
let
him
be.”

“Rickon,”
Bran
said
softly.
“Father’s
not
here.”

“Yes
he
is.
I
saw
him.”
Tears
glistened
on
Rickon’s
face.
“I
saw
him
last
night.”

“In
your
dream…?”

Rickon
nodded.
“You
leave
him.
You
leave
him
be.
He’s
coming
home
now,
like
he
promised.
He’s
coming
home.”

Bran
had
never
seen
Maester
Luwin
took
so
uncertain
before.
Blood
dripped
down
his
arm
where
Shaggydog
had
shredded
the
wool
of
his
sleeve
and
the
flesh
beneath.
“Osha,
the
torch,”
he
said,
biting
through
his
pain,
and
she
snatched
it
up
before
it
went
out.
Soot
stains
blackened
both
legs
of
his
uncle’s
likeness.
“That…
that
beast,”
Luwin
went
on,
“is
supposed
to
be
chained
up
in
the
kennels.”

Rickon
patted
Shaggydog’s
muzzle,
damp
with
blood.
“I
let
him
loose.
He
doesn’t
like
chains.”
He
licked
at
his
fingers.

“Rickon,”
Bran
said,
“would
you
like
to
come
with
me?”

“No.
I
like
it
here.”

“It’s
dark
here.
And
cold.”

“I’m
not
afraid.
I
have
to
wait
for
Father.”

“You
can
wait
with
me,”
Bran
said.
“We’ll
wait
together,
you
and
me
and
our
wolves.”
Both
of
the
direwolves
were
licking
wounds
now,
and
would
bear
close
watching.

“Bran,”
the
maester
said
firmly,
“I
know
you
mean
well,
but
Shaggydog
is
too
wild
to
run
loose.
I’m
the
third
man
he’s
savaged.
Give
him
the
freedom
of
the
castle
and
it’s
only
a
question
of
time
before
he
kills
someone.
The
truth
is
hard,
but
the
wolf
has
to
be
chained,
or…”
He
hesitated.

…or
killed,
Bran
thought,
but
what
he
said
was,
“He
was
not
made
for
chains.
We
will
wait
in
your
tower,
all
of
us.”

“That
is
quite
impossible,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

Osha
grinned.
“The
boy’s
the
lordling
here,
as
I
recall.”
She
handed
Luwin
back
his
torch
and
scooped
Bran
up
into
her
arms
again.
“The
maester’s
tower
it
is.”

“Will
you
come,
Rickon?”

His
brother
nodded.
“If
Shaggy
comes
too,”
he
said,
running
after
Osha
and
Bran,
and
there
was
nothing
Maester
Luwin
could
do
but
follow,
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
the
wolves.

Maester
Luwin’s
turret
was
so
cluttered
that
it
seemed
to
Bran
a
wonder
that
he
ever
found
anything.
Tottering
piles
of
books
covered
tables
and
chairs,
rows
of
stoppered
jars
lined
the
shelves,
candle
stubs
and
puddles
of
dried
wax
dotted
the
furniture,
the
bronze
Myrish
lens
tube
sat
on
a
tripod
by
the
terrace
door,
star
charts
hung
from
the
walls,
shadow
maps
lay
scattered
among
the
rushes,
papers,
quills,
and
pots
of
inks
were
everywhere,
and
all
of
it
was
spotted
with
droppings
from
the
ravens
in
the
rafters.
Their
strident
quorks
drifted
down
from
above
as
Osha
washed
and
cleaned
and
bandaged
the
maester’s
wounds,
under
Luwin’s
terse
instruction.
“This
is
folly,”
the
small
grey
man
said
while
she
dabbed
at
the
wolf
bites
with
a
stinging
ointment.
“I
agree
that
it
is
odd
that
both
you
boys
dreamed
the
same
dream,
yet
when
you
stop
to
consider
it,
it’s
only
natural.
You
miss
your
lord
father,
and
you
know
that
he
is
a
captive.
Fear
can
fever
a
man’s
mind
and
give
him
queer
thoughts.
Rickon
is
too
young
to
comprehend—”

“I’m
four
now,”
Rickon
said.
He
was
peeking
through
the
lens
tube
at
the
gargoyles
on
the
First
Keep.
The
direwolves
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
large
round
room,
licking
their
wounds
and
gnawing
on
bones.

“—too
young,
and—ooh,
seven
hells,
that
burns,
no,
don’t
stop,
more.
Too
young,
as
I
say,
but
you,
Bran,
you’re
old
enough
to
know
that
dreams
are
only
dreams.”

“Some
are,
some
aren’t.”
Osha
poured
pale
red
firemilk
into
a
long
gash.
Luwin
gasped.
“The
children
of
the
forest
could
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
dreaming.”

Tears
were
streaming
down
the
maester’s
face,
yet
he
shook
his
head
doggedly.
“The
children…
live
only
in
dreams.
Now.
Dead
and
gone.
Enough,
that’s
enough.
Now
the
bandages.
Pads
and
then
wrap,
and
make
it
tight,
I’ll
be
bleeding.”

“Old
Nan
says
the
children
knew
the
songs
of
the
trees,
that
they
could
fly
like
birds
and
swim
like
fish
and
talk
to
the
animals,”
Bran
said.
“She
says
that
they
made
music
so
beautiful
that
it
made
you
cry
like
a
little
baby
just
to
hear
it.”

“And
all
this
they
did
with
magic,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
distracted.
“I
wish
they
were
here
now.
A
spell
would
heal
my
arm
less
painfully,
and
they
could
talk
to
Shaggydog
and
tell
him
not
to
bite.”
He
gave
the
big
black
wolf
an
angry
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye.
“Take
a
lesson,
Bran.
The
man
who
trusts
in
spells
is
dueling
with
a
glass
sword.
As
the
children
did.
Here,
let
me
show
you
something.”
He
stood
abruptly,
crossed
the
room,
and
returned
with
a
green
jar
in
his
good
hand.
“Have
a
look
at
these,”
he
said
as
he
pulled
the
stopper
and
shook
out
a
handful
of
shiny
black
arrowheads.

Bran
picked
one
up.
“It’s
made
of
glass.”
Curious,
Rickon
drifted
closer
to
peer
over
the
table.

“Dragonglass,”
Osha
named
it
as
she
sat
down
beside
Luwin,
bandagings
in
hand.

“Obsidian,”
Maester
Luwin
insisted,
holding
out
his
wounded
arm.
“Forged
in
the
fires
of
the
gods,
far
below
the
earth.
The
children
of
the
forest
hunted
with
that,
thousands
of
years
ago.
The
children
worked
no
metal.
In
place
of
mail,
they
wore
long
shirts
of
woven
leaves
and
bound
their
legs
in
bark,
so
they
seemed
to
melt
into
the
wood.
In
place
of
swords,
they
carried
blades
of
obsidian.”

“And
still
do.”
Osha
placed
soft
pads
over
the
bites
on
the
maester’s
forearm
and
bound
them
tight
with
long
strips
of
linen.

Bran
held
the
arrowhead
up
close.
The
black
glass
was
slick
and
shiny.
He
thought
it
beautiful.
“Can
I
keep
one?”

“As
you
wish,”
the
maester
said.

“I
want
one
too,”
Rickon
said.
“I
want
four.
I’m
four.”

Luwin
made
him
count
them
out.
“Careful,
they’re
still
sharp.
Don’t
cut
yourself.”

“Tell
me
about
the
children,”
Bran
said.
It
was
important.

“What
do
you
wish
to
know?”

“Everything.”

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
chafed
against
his
neck.
“They
were
people
of
the
Dawn
Age,
the
very
first,
before
kings
and
kingdoms,”
he
said.
“In
those
days,
there
were
no
castles
or
holdfasts,
no
cities,
not
so
much
as
a
market
town
to
be
found
between
here
and
the
sea
of
Dorne.
There
were
no
men
at
all.
Only
the
children
of
the
forest
dwelt
in
the
lands
we
now
call
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

“They
were
a
people
dark
and
beautiful,
small
of
stature,
no
taller
than
children
even
when
grown
to
manhood.
They
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
wood,
in
caves
and
crannogs
and
secret
tree
towns.
Slight
as
they
were,
the
children
were
quick
and
graceful.
Male
and
female
hunted
together,
with
weirwood
bows
and
flying
snares.
Their
gods
were
the
gods
of
the
forest,
stream,
and
stone,
the
old
gods
whose
names
are
secret.
Their
wise
men
were
called
greenseers,
and
carved
strange
faces
in
the
weirwoods
to
keep
watch
on
the
woods.
How
long
the
children
reigned
here
or
where
they
came
from,
no
man
can
know.

“But
some
twelve
thousand
years
ago,
the
First
Men
appeared
from
the
east,
crossing
the
Broken
Arm
of
Dorne
before
it
was
broken.
They
came
with
bronze
swords
and
great
leathern
shields,
riding
horses.
No
horse
had
ever
been
seen
on
this
side
of
the
narrow
sea.
No
doubt
the
children
were
as
frightened
by
the
horses
as
the
First
Men
were
by
the
faces
in
the
trees.
As
the
First
Men
carved
out
holdfasts
and
farms,
they
cut
down
the
faces
and
gave
them
to
the
fire.
Horror-struck,
the
children
went
to
war.
The
old
songs
say
that
the
greenseers
used
dark
magics
to
make
the
seas
rise
and
sweep
away
the
land,
shattering
the
Arm,
but
it
was
too
late
to
close
the
door.
The
wars
went
on
until
the
earth
ran
red
with
blood
of
men
and
children
both,
but
more
children
than
men,
for
men
were
bigger
and
stronger,
and
wood
and
stone
and
obsidian
make
a
poor
match
for
bronze.
Finally
the
wise
of
both
races
prevailed,
and
the
chiefs
and
heroes
of
the
First
Men
met
the
greenseers
and
wood
dancers
amidst
the
weirwood
groves
of
a
small
island
in
the
great
lake
called
Gods
Eye.

“There
they
forged
the
Pact.
The
First
Men
were
given
the
coastlands,
the
high
plains
and
bright
meadows,
the
mountains
and
bogs,
but
the
deep
woods
were
to
remain
forever
the
children’s,
and
no
more
weirwoods
were
to
be
put
to
the
axe
anywhere
in
the
realm.
So
the
gods
might
bear
witness
to
the
signing,
every
tree
on
the
island
was
given
a
face,
and
afterward,
the
sacred
order
of
green
men
was
formed
to
keep
watch
over
the
Isle
of
Faces.

“The
Pact
began
four
thousand
years
of
friendship
between
men
and
children.
In
time,
the
First
Men
even
put
aside
the
gods
they
had
brought
with
them,
and
took
up
the
worship
of
the
secret
gods
of
the
wood.
The
signing
of
the
Pact
ended
the
Dawn
Age,
and
began
the
Age
of
Heroes.”

Bran’s
fist
curled
around
the
shiny
black
arrowhead.
“But
the
children
of
the
forest
are
all
gone
now,
you
said.”

“Here,
they
are,”
said
Osha,
as
she
bit
off
the
end
of
the
last
bandage
with
her
teeth.
“North
of
the
Wall,
things
are
different.
That’s
where
the
children
went,
and
the
giants,
and
the
other
old
races.”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“Woman,
by
rights
you
ought
to
be
dead
or
in
chains.
The
Starks
have
treated
you
more
gently
than
you
deserve.
It
is
unkind
to
repay
them
for
their
kindness
by
filling
the
boys’
heads
with
folly.”

“Tell
me
where
they
went,”
Bran
said.
“I
want
to
know.”

“Me
too,”
Rickon
echoed.

“Oh,
very
well,”
Luwin
muttered.
“So
long
as
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men
held
sway,
the
Pact
endured,
all
through
the
Age
of
Heroes
and
the
Long
Night
and
the
birth
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
yet
finally
there
came
a
time,
many
centuries
later,
when
other
peoples
crossed
the
narrow
sea.

“The
Andals
were
the
first,
a
race
of
tall,
fair-haired
warriors
who
came
with
steel
and
fire
and
the
seven-pointed
star
of
the
new
gods
painted
on
their
chests.
The
wars
lasted
hundreds
of
years,
but
in
the
end
the
six
southron
kingdoms
all
fell
before
them.
Only
here,
where
the
King
in
the
North
threw
back
every
army
that
tried
to
cross
the
Neck,
did
the
rule
of
the
First
Men
endure.
The
Andals
burnt
out
the
weirwood
groves,
hacked
down
the
faces,
slaughtered
the
children
where
they
found
them,
and
everywhere
proclaimed
the
triumph
of
the
Seven
over
the
old
gods.
So
the
children
fled
north—”

Summer
began
to
howl.

Maester
Luwin
broke
off,
startled.
When
Shaggydog
bounded
to
his
feet
and
added
his
voice
to
his
brother’s,
dread
clutched
at
Bran’s
heart.
“It’s
coming,”
he
whispered,
with
the
certainty
of
despair.
He
had
known
it
since
last
night,
he
realized,
since
the
crow
had
led
him
down
into
the
crypts
to
say
farewell.
He
had
known
it,
but
he
had
not
believed.
He
had
wanted
Maester
Luwin
to
be
right.
The
crow,
he
thought,
the
three-eyed
crow…

The
howling
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun.
Summer
padded
across
the
tower
floor
to
Shaggydog,
and
began
to
lick
at
a
mat
of
bloody
fur
on
the
back
of
his
brother’s
neck.
From
the
window
came
a
flutter
of
wings.

A
raven
landed
on
the
grey
stone
sill,
opened
its
beak,
and
gave
a
harsh,
raucous
rattle
of
distress.

Rickon
began
to
cry.
His
arrowheads
fell
from
his
hand
one
by
one
and
clattered
on
the
floor.
Bran
pulled
him
close
and
hugged
him.

Maester
Luwin
stared
at
the
black
bird
as
if
it
were
a
scorpion
with
feathers.
He
rose,
slow
as
a
sleepwalker,
and
moved
to
the
window.
When
he
whistled,
the
raven
hopped
onto
his
bandaged
forearm.
There
was
dried
blood
on
its
wings.
“A
hawk,”
Luwin
murmured,
“perhaps
an
owl.
Poor
thing,
a
wonder
it
got
through.”
He
took
the
letter
from
its
leg.

Bran
found
himself
shivering
as
the
maester
unrolled
the
paper.
“What
is
it?”
he
said,
holding
his
brother
all
the
harder.

“You
know
what
it
is,
boy,”
Osha
said,
not
unkindly.
She
put
her
hand
on
his
head.

Maester
Luwin
looked
up
at
them
numbly,
a
small
grey
man
with
blood
on
the
sleeve
of
his
grey
wool
robe
and
tears
in
his
bright
grey
eyes.
“My
lords,”
he
said
to
the
sons,
in
a
voice
gone
hoarse
and
shrunken,
“we…
we
shall
need
to
find
a
stonecarver
who
knew
his
likeness
well…”





SANSA

In
the
tower
room
at
the
heart
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
Sansa
gave
herself
to
the
darkness.

She
drew
the
curtains
around
her
bed,
slept,
woke
weeping,
and
slept
again.
When
she
could
not
sleep
she
lay
under
her
blankets
shivering
with
grief.
Servants
came
and
went,
bringing
meals,
but
the
sight
of
food
was
more
than
she
could
bear.
The
dishes
piled
up
on
the
table
beneath
her
window,
untouched
and
spoiling,
until
the
servants
took
them
away
again.

Sometimes
her
sleep
was
leaden
and
dreamless,
and
she
woke
from
it
more
tired
than
when
she
had
closed
her
eyes.
Yet
those
were
the
best
times,
for
when
she
dreamed,
she
dreamed
of
Father.
Waking
or
sleeping,
she
saw
him,
saw
the
gold
cloaks
fling
him
down,
saw
Ser
Ilyn
striding
forward,
unsheathing
Ice
from
the
scabbard
on
his
back,
saw
the
moment…
the
moment
when…
she
had
wanted
to
look
away,
she
had
wanted
to,
her
legs
had
gone
out
from
under
her
and
she
had
fallen
to
her
knees,
yet
somehow
she
could
not
turn
her
head,
and
all
the
people
were
screaming
and
shouting,
and
her
prince
had
smiled
at
her,
he’d
smiled
and
she’d
felt
safe,
but
only
for
a
heartbeat,
until
he
said
those
words,
and
her
father’s
legs…
that
was
what
she
remembered,
his
legs,
the
way
they’d
jerked
when
Ser
Ilyn…
when
the
sword…

Perhaps
I
will
die
too,
she
told
herself,
and
the
thought
did
not
seem
so
terrible
to
her.
If
she
flung
herself
from
the
window,
she
could
put
an
end
to
her
suffering,
and
in
the
years
to
come
the
singers
would
write
songs
of
her
grief.
Her
body
would
lie
on
the
stones
below,
broken
and
innocent,
shaming
all
those
who
had
betrayed
her.
Sansa
went
so
far
as
to
cross
the
bedchamber
and
throw
open
the
shutters…
but
then
her
courage
left
her,
and
she
ran
back
to
her
bed,
sobbing.

The
serving
girls
tried
to
talk
to
her
when
they
brought
her
meals,
but
she
never
answered
them.
Once
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
with
a
box
of
flasks
and
bottles,
to
ask
if
she
was
ill.
He
felt
her
brow,
made
her
undress,
and
touched
her
all
over
while
her
bedmaid
held
her
down.
When
he
left
he
gave
her
a
potion
of
honeywater
and
herbs
and
told
her
to
drink
a
swallow
every
night.
She
drank
it
all
right
then
and
went
back
to
sleep.

She
dreamt
of
footsteps
on
the
tower
stair,
an
ominous
scraping
of
leather
on
stone
as
a
man
climbed
slowly
toward
her
bedchamber,
step
by
step.
All
she
could
do
was
huddle
behind
her
door
and
listen,
trembling,
as
he
came
closer
and
closer.
It
was
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
she
knew,
coming
for
her
with
Ice
in
his
hand,
coming
to
take
her
head.
There
was
no
place
to
run,
no
place
to
hide,
no
way
to
bar
the
door.
Finally
the
footsteps
stopped
and
she
knew
he
was
just
outside,
standing
there
silent
with
his
dead
eyes
and
his
long
pocked
face.
That
was
when
she
realized
she
was
naked.
She
crouched
down,
trying
to
cover
herself
with
her
hands,
as
her
door
began
to
swing
open,
creaking,
the
point
of
the
greatsword
poking
through…

She
woke
murmuring,
“Please,
please,
I’ll
be
good,
I’ll
be
good,
please
don’t,”
but
there
was
no
one
to
hear.

When
they
finally
came
for
her
in
truth,
Sansa
never
heard
their
footsteps.
It
was
Joffrey
who
opened
her
door,
not
Ser
Ilyn
but
the
boy
who
had
been
her
prince.
She
was
in
bed,
curled
up
tight,
her
curtains
drawn,
and
she
could
not
have
said
if
it
was
noon
or
midnight.
The
first
thing
she
heard
was
the
slam
of
the
door.
Then
her
bed
hangings
were
yanked
back,
and
she
threw
up
a
hand
against
the
sudden
light
and
saw
them
standing
over
her.

“You
will
attend
me
in
court
this
afternoon,”
Joffrey
said.
“See
that
you
bathe
and
dress
as
befits
my
betrothed.”
Sandor
Clegane
stood
at
his
shoulder
in
a
plain
brown
doublet
and
green
mantle,
his
burned
face
hideous
in
the
morning
light.
Behind
them
were
two
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
in
long
white
satin
cloaks.

Sansa
drew
her
blanket
up
to
her
chin
to
cover
herself.
“No,”
she
whimpered,
“please…
leave
me
be.”

“If
you
won’t
rise
and
dress
yourself,
my
Hound
will
do
it
for
you,”
Joffrey
said.

“I
beg
of
you,
my
prince…”

“I’m
king
now.
Dog,
get
her
out
of
bed.”

Sandor
Clegane
scooped
her
up
around
the
waist
and
lifted
her
off
the
featherbed
as
she
struggled
feebly.
Her
blanket
fell
to
the
floor.
Underneath
she
had
only
a
thin
bedgown
to
cover
her
nakedness.
“Do
as
you’re
bid,
child,”
Clegane
said.
“Dress.”
He
pushed
her
toward
her
wardrobe,
almost
gently.

Sansa
backed
away
from
them.
“I
did
as
the
queen
asked,
I
wrote
the
letters,
I
wrote
what
she
told
me.
You
promised
you’d
be
merciful.
Please,
let
me
go
home.
I
won’t
do
any
treason,
I’ll
be
good,
I
swear
it,
I
don’t
have
traitor’s
blood,
I
don’t.
I
only
want
to
go
home.”
Remembering
her
courtesies,
she
lowered
her
head.
“As
it
please
you,”
she
finished
weakly.

“It
does
not
please
me,”
Joffrey
said.
“Mother
says
I’m
still
to
marry
you,
so
you’ll
stay
here,
and
you’ll
obey.”

“I
don’t
want
to
marry
you,”
Sansa
wailed.
“You
chopped
off
my
father’s
head!”

“He
was
a
traitor.
I
never
promised
to
spare
him,
only
that
I’d
be
merciful,
and
I
was.
If
he
hadn’t
been
your
father,
I
would
have
had
him
torn
or
flayed,
but
I
gave
him
a
clean
death.”

Sansa
stared
at
him,
seeing
him
for
the
first
time.
He
was
wearing
a
padded
crimson
doublet
patterned
with
lions
and
a
cloth-of-gold
cape
with
a
high
collar
that
framed
his
face.
She
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
thought
him
handsome.
His
lips
were
as
soft
and
red
as
the
worms
you
found
after
a
rain,
and
his
eyes
were
vain
and
cruel.
“I
hate
you,”
she
whispered.

King
Joffrey’s
face
hardened.
“My
mother
tells
me
that
it
isn’t
fitting
that
a
king
should
strike
his
wife.
Ser
Meryn.”

The
knight
was
on
her
before
she
could
think,
yanking
back
her
hand
as
she
tried
to
shield
her
face
and
backhanding
her
across
the
ear
with
a
gloved
fist.
Sansa
did
not
remember
failing,
yet
the
next
she
knew
she
was
sprawled
on
one
knee
amongst
the
rushes.
Her
head
was
ringing.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
stood
over
her,
with
blood
on
the
knuckles
of
his
white
silk
glove.

“Will
you
obey
now,
or
shall
I
have
him
chastise
you
again?”

Sansa’s
ear
felt
numb.
She
touched
it,
and
her
fingertips
came
away
wet
and
red.
“I…
as…
as
you
command,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
Joffrey
corrected
her.
“I
shall
look
for
you
in
court.”
He
turned
and
left.

Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Arys
followed
him
out,
but
Sandor
Clegane
lingered
long
enough
to
yank
her
roughly
to
her
feet.
“Save
yourself
some
pain,
girl,
and
give
him
what
he
wants.”

“What…
what
does
he
want?
Please,
tell
me.”

“He
wants
you
to
smile
and
smell
sweet
and
be
his
lady
love,”
the
Hound
rasped.
“He
wants
to
hear
you
recite
all
your
pretty
little
words
the
way
the
septa
taught
you.
He
wants
you
to
love
him…
and
fear
him.”

After
he
was
gone,
Sansa
sank
back
onto
the
rushes,
staring
at
the
wall
until
two
of
her
bedmaids
crept
timidly
into
the
chamber.
“I
will
need
hot
water
for
my
bath,
please,”
she
told
them,
“and
perfume,
and
some
powder
to
hide
this
bruise.”
The
right
side
of
her
face
was
swollen
and
beginning
to
ache,
but
she
knew
Joffrey
would
want
her
to
be
beautiful.

The
hot
water
made
her
think
of
Winterfell,
and
she
took
strength
from
that.
She
had
not
washed
since
the
day
her
father
died,
and
she
was
startled
at
how
filthy
the
water
became.
Her
maids
sluiced
the
blood
off
her
face,
scrubbed
the
dirt
from
her
back,
washed
her
hair
and
brushed
it
out
until
it
sprang
back
in
thick
auburn
curls.
Sansa
did
not
speak
to
them,
except
to
give
them
commands;
they
were
Lannister
servants,
not
her
own,
and
she
did
not
trust
them.
When
the
time
came
to
dress,
she
chose
the
green
silk
gown
that
she
had
worn
to
the
tourney.
She
recalled
how
gallant
Joff
had
been
to
her
that
night
at
the
feast.
Perhaps
it
would
make
him
remember
as
well,
and
treat
her
more
gently.

She
drank
a
glass
of
buttermilk
and
nibbled
at
some
sweet
biscuits
as
she
waited,
to
settle
her
stomach.
It
was
midday
when
Ser
Meryn
returned.
He
had
donned
his
white
armor;
a
shirt
of
enameled
scales
chased
with
gold,
a
tall
helm
with
a
golden
sunburst
crest,
greaves
and
gorget
and
gauntlet
and
boots
of
gleaming
plate,
a
heavy
wool
cloak
clasped
with
a
golden
lion.
His
visor
had
been
removed
from
his
helm,
to
better
show
his
dour
face;
pouchy
bags
under
his
eyes,
a
wide
sour
mouth,
rusty
hair
spotted
with
grey.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
bowing,
as
if
he
had
not
beaten
her
bloody
only
three
hours
past.
“His
Grace
has
instructed
me
to
escort
you
to
the
throne
room.”

“Did
he
instruct
you
to
hit
me
if
I
refused
to
come?”

“Are
you
refusing
to
come,
my
lady?”
The
look
he
gave
her
was
without
expression.
He
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
the
bruise
he
had
left
her.

He
did
not
hate
her,
Sansa
realized;
neither
did
he
love
her.
He
felt
nothing
for
her
at
all.
She
was
only
a…
a
thing
to
him.
“No,”
she
said,
rising.
She
wanted
to
rage,
to
hurt
him
as
he’d
hurt
her,
to
warn
him
that
when
she
was
queen
she
would
have
him
exiled
if
he
ever
dared
strike
her
again…
but
she
remembered
what
the
Hound
had
told
her,
so
all
she
said
was,
“I
shall
do
whatever
His
Grace
commands.”

“As
I
do,”
he
replied.

“Yes…
but
you
are
no
true
knight,
Ser
Meryn.”

Sandor
Clegane
would
have
laughed
at
that,
Sansa
knew.
Other
men
might
have
cursed
her,
warned
her
to
keep
silent,
even
begged
for
her
forgiveness.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
did
none
of
these.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
simply
did
not
care.

The
balcony
was
deserted
save
for
Sansa.
She
stood
with
her
head
bowed,
fighting
to
hold
back
her
tears,
while
below
Joffrey
sat
on
his
Iron
Throne
and
dispensed
what
it
pleased
him
to
call
justice.
Nine
cases
out
of
ten
seemed
to
bore
him;
those
he
allowed
his
council
to
handle,
squirming
restlessly
while
Lord
Baelish,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
or
Queen
Cersei
resolved
the
matter.
When
he
did
choose
to
make
a
ruling,
though,
not
even
his
queen
mother
could
sway
him.

A
thief
was
brought
before
him
and
he
had
Ser
Ilyn
chop
his
hand
off,
right
there
in
court.
Two
knights
came
to
him
with
a
dispute
about
some
land,
and
he
decreed
that
they
should
duel
for
it
on
the
morrow.
“To
the
death,”
he
added.
A
woman
fell
to
her
knees
to
plead
for
the
head
of
a
man
executed
as
a
traitor.
She
had
loved
him,
she
said,
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
decently
buried.
“If
you
loved
a
traitor,
you
must
be
a
traitor
too,”
Joffrey
said.
Two
gold
cloaks
dragged
her
off
to
the
dungeons.

Frog-faced
Lord
Slynt
sat
at
the
end
of
the
council
table
wearing
a
black
velvet
doublet
and
a
shiny
cloth-of-gold
cape,
nodding
with
approval
every
time
the
king
pronounced
a
sentence.
Sansa
stared
hard
at
his
ugly
face,
remembering
how
he
had
thrown
down
her
father
for
Ser
Ilyn
to
behead,
wishing
she
could
hurt
him,
wishing
that
some
hero
would
throw
him
down
and
cut
off
his
head.
But
a
voice
inside
her
whispered,
There
are
no
heroes,
and
she
remembered
what
Lord
Petyr
had
said
to
her,
here
in
this
very
hall.
“Life
is
not
a
song,
sweetling,”
he’d
told
her.
“You
may
learn
that
one
day
to
your
sorrow.”
In
life,
the
monsters
win,
she
told
herself,
and
now
it
was
the
Hound’s
voice
she
heard,
a
cold
rasp,
metal
on
stone.
“Save
yourself
some
pain,
girl,
and
give
him
what
he
wants.”

The
last
case
was
a
plump
tavern
singer,
accused
of
making
a
song
that
ridiculed
the
late
King
Robert.
Joff
commanded
them
to
fetch
his
woodharp
and
ordered
him
to
perform
the
song
for
the
court.
The
singer
wept
and
swore
he
would
never
sing
that
song
again,
but
the
king
insisted.
It
was
sort
of
a
funny
song,
all
about
Robert
fighting
with
a
pig.
The
pig
was
the
boar
who’d
killed
him,
Sansa
knew,
but
in
some
verses
it
almost
sounded
as
if
he
were
singing
about
the
queen.
When
the
song
was
done,
Joffrey
announced
that
he’d
decided
to
be
merciful.
The
singer
could
keep
either
his
fingers
or
his
tongue.
He
would
have
a
day
to
make
his
choice.
Janos
Slynt
nodded.

That
was
the
final
business
of
the
afternoon,
Sansa
saw
with
relief,
but
her
ordeal
was
not
yet
done.
When
the
herald’s
voice
dismissed
the
court,
she
fled
the
balcony,
only
to
find
Joffrey
waiting
for
her
at
the
base
of
the
curving
stairs.
The
Hound
was
with
him,
and
Ser
Meryn
as
well.
The
young
king
examined
her
critically,
top
to
bottom.
“You
look
much
better
than
you
did.”

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace,”
Sansa
said.
Hollow
words,
but
they
made
him
nod
and
smile.

“Walk
with
me,”
Joffrey
commanded,
offering
her
his
arm.
She
had
no
choice
but
to
take
it.
The
touch
of
his
hand
would
have
thrilled
her
once;
now
it
made
her
flesh
crawl.
“My
name
day
will
be
here
soon,”
Joffrey
said
as
they
slipped
out
the
rear
of
the
throne
room.
“There
will
be
a
great
feast,
and
gifts.
What
are
you
going
to
give
me?”

“I…
I
had
not
thought,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
he
said
sharply.
“You
truly
are
a
stupid
girl,
aren’t
you?
My
mother
says
so.”

“She
does?”
After
all
that
had
happened,
his
words
should
have
lost
their
power
to
hurt
her,
yet
somehow
they
had
not.
The
queen
had
always
been
so
kind
to
her.

“Oh,
yes.
She
worries
about
our
children,
whether
they’ll
be
stupid
like
you,
but
I
told
her
not
to
trouble
herself.”
The
king
gestured,
and
Ser
Meryn
opened
a
door
for
them.

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace,”
she
murmured.
The
Hound
was
right,
she
thought,
I
am
only
a
little
bird,
repeating
the
words
they
taught
me.
The
sun
had
fallen
below
the
western
wall,
and
the
stones
of
the
Red
Keep
glowed
dark
as
blood.

“I’ll
get
you
with
child
as
soon
as
you’re
able,”
Joffrey
said
as
he
escorted
her
across
the
practice
yard.
“If
the
first
one
is
stupid,
I’ll
chop
off
your
head
and
find
a
smarter
wife.
When
do
you
think
you’ll
be
able
to
have
children?”

Sansa
could
not
look
at
him,
he
shamed
her
so.
“Septa
Mordane
says
most…
most
highborn
girls
have
their
flowering
at
twelve
or
thirteen.”

Joffrey
nodded.
“This
way.”
He
led
her
into
the
gatehouse,
to
the
base
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
battlements.

Sansa
jerked
back
away
from
him,
trembling.
Suddenly
she
knew
where
they
were
going.
“No,”
she
said,
her
voice
a
frightened
gasp.
“Please,
no,
don’t
make
me,
I
beg
you…”

Joffrey
pressed
his
lips
together.
“I
want
to
show
you
what
happens
to
traitors.”

Sansa
shook
her
head
wildly.
“I
won’t.
I
won’t.”

“I
can
have
Ser
Meryn
drag
you
up,”
he
said.
“You
won’t
like
that.
You
had
better
do
what
I
say.”
Joffrey
reached
for
her,
and
Sansa
cringed
away
from
him,
backing
into
the
Hound.

“Do
it,
girl,”
Sandor
Clegane
told
her,
pushing
her
back
toward
the
king.
His
mouth
twitched
on
the
burned
side
of
his
face
and
Sansa
could
almost
hear
the
rest
of
it.
He’ll
have
you
up
there
no
matter
what,
so
give
him
what
he
wants.

She
forced
herself
to
take
King
Joffrey’s
hand.
The
climb
was
something
out
of
a
nightmare;
every
step
was
a
struggle,
as
if
she
were
pulling
her
feet
out
of
ankle-deep
mud,
and
there
were
more
steps
than
she
would
have
believed,
a
thousand
thousand
steps,
and
horror
waiting
on
the
ramparts.

From
the
high
battlements
of
the
gatehouse,
the
whole
world
spread
out
below
them.
Sansa
could
see
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
Visenya’s
hill,
where
her
father
had
died.
At
the
other
end
of
the
Street
of
the
Sisters
stood
the
fire-blackened
ruins
of
the
Dragonpit.
To
the
west,
the
swollen
red
sun
was
half-hidden
behind
the
Gate
of
the
Gods.
The
salt
sea
was
at
her
back,
and
to
the
south
was
the
fish
market
and
the
docks
and
the
swirling
torrent
of
the
Blackwater
Rush.
And
to
the
north…

She
turned
that
way,
and
saw
only
the
city,
streets
and
alleys
and
hills
and
bottoms
and
more
streets
and
more
alleys
and
the
stone
of
distant
walls.
Yet
she
knew
that
beyond
them
was
open
country,
farms
and
fields
and
forests,
and
beyond
that,
north
and
north
and
north
again,
stood
Winterfell.

“What
are
you
looking
at?”
Joffrey
said.
“This
is
what
I
wanted
you
to
see,
right
here.”

A
thick
stone
parapet
protected
the
outer
edge
of
the
rampart,
reaching
as
high
as
Sansa’s
chin,
with
crenellations
cut
into
it
every
five
feet
for
archers.
The
heads
were
mounted
between
the
crenels,
along
the
top
of
the
wall,
impaled
on
iron
spikes
so
they
faced
out
over
the
city.
Sansa
had
noted
them
the
moment
she’d
stepped
out
onto
the
wallwalk,
but
the
river
and
the
bustling
streets
and
the
setting
sun
were
ever
so
much
prettier.
He
can
make
me
look
at
the
heads,
she
told
herself,
but
he
can’t
make
me
see
them.

“This
one
is
your
father,”
he
said.
“This
one
here.
Dog,
turn
it
around
so
she
can
see
him.”

Sandor
Clegane
took
the
head
by
the
hair
and
turned
it.
The
severed
head
had
been
dipped
in
tar
to
preserve
it
longer.
Sansa
looked
at
it
calmly,
not
seeing
it
at
all.
It
did
not
really
look
like
Lord
Eddard,
she
thought;
it
did
not
even
look
real.
“How
long
do
I
have
to
look?”

Joffrey
seemed
disappointed.
“Do
you
want
to
see
the
rest?”
There
was
a
long
row
of
them.

“If
it
please
Your
Grace.”

Joffrey
marched
her
down
the
wallwalk,
past
a
dozen
more
heads
and
two
empty
spikes.
“I’m
saving
those
for
my
uncle
Stannis
and
my
uncle
Renly,”
he
explained.
The
other
heads
had
been
dead
and
mounted
much
longer
than
her
father.
Despite
the
tar,
most
were
long
past
being
recognizable.
The
king
pointed
to
one
and
said,
“That’s
your
septa
there,”
but
Sansa
could
not
even
have
told
that
it
was
a
woman.
The
jaw
had
rotted
off
her
face,
and
birds
had
eaten
one
ear
and
most
of
a
cheek.

Sansa
had
wondered
what
had
happened
to
Septa
Mordane,
although
she
supposed
she
had
known
all
along.
“Why
did
you
kill
her?”
she
asked.
“She
was
godsworn…”

“She
was
a
traitor.”
Joffrey
looked
pouty;
somehow
she
was
upsetting
him.
“You
haven’t
said
what
you
mean
to
give
me
for
my
name
day.
Maybe
I
should
give
you
something
instead,
would
you
like
that?”

“If
it
please
you,
my
lord,”
Sansa
said.

When
he
smiled,
she
knew
he
was
mocking
her.
“Your
brother
is
a
traitor
too,
you
know.”
He
turned
Septa
Mordane’s
head
back
around.
“I
remember
your
brother
from
Winterfell.
My
dog
called
him
the
lord
of
the
wooden
sword.
Didn’t
you,
dog?”

“Did
I?”
the
Hound
replied.
“I
don’t
recall.”

Joffrey
gave
a
petulant
shrug.
“Your
brother
defeated
my
uncle
Jaime.
My
mother
says
it
was
treachery
and
deceit.
She
wept
when
she
heard.
Women
are
all
weak,
even
her,
though
she
pretends
she
isn’t.
She
says
we
need
to
stay
in
King’s
Landing
in
case
my
other
uncles
attack,
but
I
don’t
care.
After
my
name
day
feast,
I’m
going
to
raise
a
host
and
kill
your
brother
myself.
That’s
what
I’ll
give
you,
Lady
Sansa.
Your
brother’s
head.”

A
kind
of
madness
took
over
her
then,
and
she
heard
herself
say,
“Maybe
my
brother
will
give
me
your
head.”

Joffrey
scowled.
“You
must
never
mock
me
like
that.
A
true
wife
does
not
mock
her
lord.
Ser
Meryn,
teach
her.”

This
time
the
knight
grasped
her
beneath
the
jaw
and
held
her
head
still
as
he
struck
her.
He
hit
her
twice,
left
to
right,
and
harder,
right
to
left.
Her
lip
split
and
blood
ran
down
her
chin,
to
mingle
with
the
salt
of
her
tears.

“You
shouldn’t
be
crying
all
the
time,”
Joffrey
told
her.
“You’re
more
pretty
when
you
smile
and
laugh.”

Sansa
made
herself
smile,
afraid
that
he
would
have
Ser
Meryn
hit
her
again
if
she
did
not,
but
it
was
no
good,
the
king
still
shook
his
head.
“Wipe
off
the
blood,
you’re
all
messy.”

The
outer
parapet
came
up
to
her
chin,
but
along
the
inner
edge
of
the
walk
was
nothing,
nothing
but
a
long
plunge
to
the
bailey
seventy
or
eighty
feet
below.
All
it
would
take
was
a
shove,
she
told
herself.
He
was
standing
right
there,
right
there,
smirking
at
her
with
those
fat
wormlips.
You
could
do
it,
she
told
herself.
You
could.
Do
it
right
now.
It
wouldn’t
even
matter
if
she
went
over
with
him.
It
wouldn’t
matter
at
all.

“Here,
girl.”
Sandor
Clegane
knelt
before
her,
between
her
and
Joffrey.
With
a
delicacy
surprising
in
such
a
big
man,
he
dabbed
at
the
blood
welling
from
her
broken
lip.

The
moment
was
gone.
Sansa
lowered
her
eyes.
“Thank
you,”
she
said
when
he
was
done.
She
was
a
good
girl,
and
always
remembered
her
courtesies.





DAENERYS

Wings
shadowed
her
fever
dreams.

“You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

She
was
walking
down
a
long
hall
beneath
high
stone
arches.
She
could
not
look
behind
her,
must
not
look
behind
her.
There
was
a
door
ahead
of
her,
tiny
with
distance,
but
even
from
afar,
she
saw
that
it
was
painted
red.
She
walked
faster,
and
her
bare
feet
left
bloody
footprints
on
the
stone.

“You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

She
saw
sunlight
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
the
living
plain,
rich
with
the
smells
of
earth
and
death.
Wind
stirred
the
grasses,
and
they
rippled
like
water.
Drogo
held
her
in
strong
arms,
and
his
hand
stroked
her
sex
and
opened
her
and
woke
that
sweet
wetness
that
was
his
alone,
and
the
stars
smiled
down
on
them,
stars
in
a
daylight
sky.
“Home,”
she
whispered
as
he
entered
her
and
filled
her
with
his
seed,
but
suddenly
the
stars
were
gone,
and
across
the
blue
sky
swept
the
great
wings,
and
the
world
took
flame.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

Ser
Jorah’s
face
was
drawn
and
sorrowful.
“Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,”
he
told
her.
He
warmed
translucent
hands
over
a
glowing
brazier
where
stone
eggs
smouldered
red
as
coals.
One
moment
he
was
there
and
the
next
he
was
fading,
his
flesh
colorless,
less
substantial
than
the
wind.
“The
last
dragon,”
he
whispered,
thin
as
a
wisp,
and
was
gone.
She
felt
the
dark
behind
her,
and
the
red
door
seemed
farther
away
than
ever.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

Viserys
stood
before
her,
screaming.
“The
dragon
does
not
beg,
slut.
You
do
not
command
the
dragon.
I
am
the
dragon,
and
I
will
be
crowned.”
The
molten
gold
trickled
down
his
face
like
wax,
burning
deep
channels
in
his
flesh.
“I
am
the
dragon
and
I
will
be
crowned!”
he
shrieked,
and
his
fingers
snapped
like
snakes,
biting
at
her
nipples,
pinching,
twisting,
even
as
his
eyes
burst
and
ran
like
jelly
down
seared
and
blackened
cheeks.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

The
red
door
was
so
far
ahead
of
her,
and
she
could
feel
the
icy
breath
behind,
sweeping
up
on
her.
If
it
caught
her
she
would
die
a
death
that
was
more
than
death,
howling
forever
alone
in
the
darkness.
She
began
to
run.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

She
could
feel
the
heat
inside
her,
a
terrible
burning
in
her
womb.
Her
son
was
tall
and
proud,
with
Drogo’s
copper
skin
and
her
own
silver-gold
hair,
violet
eyes
shaped
like
almonds.
And
he
smiled
for
her
and
began
to
lift
his
hand
toward
hers,
but
when
he
opened
his
mouth
the
fire
poured
out.
She
saw
his
heart
burning
through
his
chest,
and
in
an
instant
he
was
gone,
consumed
like
a
moth
by
a
candle,
turned
to
ash.
She
wept
for
her
child,
the
promise
of
a
sweet
mouth
on
her
breast,
but
her
tears
turned
to
steam
as
they
touched
her
skin.

“…want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

Ghosts
lined
the
hallway,
dressed
in
the
faded
raiment
of
kings.
In
their
hands
were
swords
of
pale
fire.
They
had
hair
of
silver
and
hair
of
gold
and
hair
of
platinum
white,
and
their
eyes
were
opal
and
amethyst,
tourmaline
and
jade.
“Faster,”
they
cried,
“faster,
faster.”
She
raced,
her
feet
melting
the
stone
wherever
they
touched.
“Faster!”
the
ghosts
cried
as
one,
and
she
screamed
and
threw
herself
forward.
A
great
knife
of
pain
ripped
down
her
back,
and
she
felt
her
skin
tear
open
and
smelled
the
stench
of
burning
blood
and
saw
the
shadow
of
wings.
And
Daenerys
Targaryen
flew.

“…wake
the
dragon…”

The
door
loomed
before
her,
the
red
door,
so
close,
so
close,
the
hall
was
a
blur
around
her,
the
cold
receding
behind.
And
now
the
stone
was
gone
and
she
flew
across
the
Dothraki
sea,
high
and
higher,
the
green
rippling
beneath,
and
all
that
lived
and
breathed
fled
in
terror
from
the
shadow
of
her
wings.
She
could
smell
home,
she
could
see
it,
there,
just
beyond
that
door,
green
fields
and
great
stone
houses
and
arms
to
keep
her
warm,
there.
She
threw
open
the
door.

“…the
dragon…”

And
saw
her
brother
Rhaegar,
mounted
on
a
stallion
as
black
as
his
armor.
Fire
glimmered
red
through
the
narrow
eye
slit
of
his
helm.
“The
last
dragon,”
Ser
Jorah’s
voice
whispered
faintly.
“The
last,
the
last.”
Dany
lifted
his
polished
black
visor.
The
face
within
was
her
own.

After
that,
for
a
long
time,
there
was
only
the
pain,
the
fire
within
her,
and
the
whisperings
of
stars.

She
woke
to
the
taste
of
ashes.

“No,”
she
moaned,
“no,
please.”

“Khaleesi?”
Jhiqui
hovered
over
her,
a
frightened
doe.

The
tent
was
drenched
in
shadow,
still
and
close.
Flakes
of
ash
drifted
upward
from
a
brazier,
and
Dany
followed
them
with
her
eyes
through
the
smoke
hole
above.
Flying,
she
thought.
I
had
wings,
I
was
flying.
But
it
was
only
a
dream.
“Help
me,”
she
whispered,
struggling
to
rise.
“Bring
me…”
Her
voice
was
raw
as
a
wound,
and
she
could
not
think
what
she
wanted.
Why
did
she
hurt
so
much?
It
was
as
if
her
body
had
been
torn
to
pieces
and
remade
from
the
scraps.
“I
want…”

“Yes,
Khaleesi.”
Quick
as
that
Jhiqui
was
gone,
bolting
from
the
tent,
shouting.
Dany
needed…
something…
someone…
what?
It
was
important,
she
knew.
It
was
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
mattered.
She
rolled
onto
her
side
and
got
an
elbow
under
her,
fighting
the
blanket
tangled
about
her
legs.
It
was
so
hard
to
move.
The
world
swam
dizzily.
I
have
to…

They
found
her
on
the
carpet,
crawling
toward
her
dragon
eggs.
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
back
to
her
sleeping
silks,
while
she
struggled
feebly
against
him.
Over
his
shoulder
she
saw
her
three
handmaids,
Jhogo
with
his
little
wisp
of
mustache,
and
the
flat
broad
face
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“I
must,”
she
tried
to
tell
them,
“I
have
to…”

“…sleep,
Princess,”
Ser
Jorah
said.

“No,”
Dany
said.
“Please.
Please.”

“Yes.”
He
covered
her
with
silk,
though
she
was
burning.
“Sleep
and
grow
strong
again,
Khaleesi.
Come
back
to
us.”
And
then
Mirri
Maz
Duur
was
there,
the
maegi,
tipping
a
cup
against
her
lips.
She
tasted
sour
milk,
and
something
else,
something
thick
and
bitter.
Warm
liquid
ran
down
her
chin.
Somehow
she
swallowed.
The
tent
grew
dimmer,
and
sleep
took
her
again.
This
time
she
did
not
dream.
She
floated,
serene
and
at
peace,
on
a
black
sea
that
knew
no
shore.

After
a
time—a
night,
a
day,
a
year,
she
could
not
say—she
woke
again.
The
tent
was
dark,
its
silken
walls
flapping
like
wings
when
the
wind
gusted
outside.
This
time
Dany
did
not
attempt
to
rise.
“Irri,”
she
called,
“Jhiqui.
Doreah.”
They
were
there
at
once.
“My
throat
is
dry,”
she
said,
“so
dry,”
and
they
brought
her
water.
It
was
warm
and
flat,
yet
Dany
drank
it
eagerly,
and
sent
Jhiqui
for
more.
Irri
dampened
a
soft
cloth
and
stroked
her
brow.
“I
have
been
sick,”
Dany
said.
The
Dothraki
girl
nodded.
“How
long?”
The
cloth
was
soothing,
but
Irri
seemed
so
sad,
it
frightened
her.
“Long,”
she
whispered.
When
Jhiqui
returned
with
more
water,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
came
with
her,
eyes
heavy
from
sleep.
“Drink,”
she
said,
lifting
Dany’s
head
to
the
cup
once
more,
but
this
time
it
was
only
wine.
Sweet,
sweet
wine.
Dany
drank,
and
lay
back,
listening
to
the
soft
sound
of
her
own
breathing.
She
could
feel
the
heaviness
in
her
limbs,
as
sleep
crept
in
to
fill
her
up
once
more.
“Bring
me…”
she
murmured,
her
voice
slurred
and
drowsy.
“Bring…
I
want
to
hold…”

“Yes?”
the
maegi
asked.
“What
is
it
you
wish,
Khaleesi?”

“Bring
me…
egg…
dragon’s
egg…
please…”
Her
lashes
turned
to
lead,
and
she
was
too
weary
to
hold
them
up.

When
she
woke
the
third
time,
a
shaft
of
golden
sunlight
was
pouring
through
the
smoke
hole
of
the
tent,
and
her
arms
were
wrapped
around
a
dragon’s
egg.
It
was
the
pale
one,
its
scales
the
color
of
butter
cream,
veined
with
whorls
of
gold
and
bronze,
and
Dany
could
feel
the
heat
of
it.
Beneath
her
bedsilks,
a
fine
sheen
of
perspiration
covered
her
bare
skin.
Dragondew,
she
thought.
Her
fingers
trailed
lightly
across
the
surface
of
the
shell,
tracing
the
wisps
of
gold,
and
deep
in
the
stone
she
felt
something
twist
and
stretch
in
response.
It
did
not
frighten
her.
All
her
fear
was
gone,
burned
away.

Dany
touched
her
brow.
Under
the
film
of
sweat,
her
skin
was
cool
to
the
touch,
her
fever
gone.
She
made
herself
sit.
There
was
a
moment
of
dizziness,
and
the
deep
ache
between
her
thighs.
Yet
she
felt
strong.
Her
maids
came
running
at
the
sound
of
her
voice.
“Water,”
she
told
them,
“a
flagon
of
water,
cold
as
you
can
find
it.
And
fruit,
I
think.
Dates.”

“As
you
say,
Khaleesi.”

“I
want
Ser
Jorah,”
she
said,
standing.
Jhiqui
brought
a
sandsilk
robe
and
draped
it
over
her
shoulders.
“And
a
warm
bath,
and
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
and…”
Memory
came
back
to
her
all
at
once,
and
she
faltered.
“Khal
Drogo,”
she
forced
herself
to
say,
watching
their
faces
with
dread.
“Is
he—?”

“The
khal
lives,”
Irri
answered
quietly…
yet
Dany
saw
a
darkness
in
her
eyes
when
she
said
the
words,
and
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
she
rushed
away
to
fetch
water.

She
turned
to
Doreah.
“Tell
me.”

“I…
I
shall
bring
Ser
Jorah,”
the
Lysene
girl
said,
bowing
her
head
and
fleeing
the
tent.

Jhiqui
would
have
run
as
well,
but
Dany
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
held
her
captive.
“What
is
it?
I
must
know.
Drogo…
and
my
child.”
Why
had
she
not
remembered
the
child
until
now?
“My
son…
Rhaego…
where
is
he?
I
want
him.”

Her
handmaid
lowered
her
eyes.
“The
boy…
he
did
not
live,
Khaleesi.”
Her
voice
was
a
frightened
whisper.

Dany
released
her
wrist.
My
son
is
dead,
she
thought
as
Jhiqui
left
the
tent.
She
had
known
somehow.
She
had
known
since
she
woke
the
first
time
to
Jhiqui’s
tears.
No,
she
had
known
before
she
woke.
Her
dream
came
back
to
her,
sudden
and
vivid,
and
she
remembered
the
tall
man
with
the
copper
skin
and
long
silver-gold
braid,
bursting
into
flame.

She
should
weep,
she
knew,
yet
her
eyes
were
dry
as
ash.
She
had
wept
in
her
dream,
and
the
tears
had
turned
to
steam
on
her
cheeks.
All
the
grief
has
been
burned
out
of
me,
she
told
herself.
She
felt
sad,
and
yet…
she
could
feel
Rhaego
receding
from
her,
as
if
he
had
never
been.

Ser
Jorah
and
Mirri
Maz
Duur
entered
a
few
moments
later,
and
found
Dany
standing
over
the
other
dragon’s
eggs,
the
two
still
in
their
chest.
It
seemed
to
her
that
they
felt
as
hot
as
the
one
she
had
slept
with,
which
was
passing
strange.
“Ser
Jorah,
come
here,”
she
said.
She
took
his
hand
and
placed
it
on
the
black
egg
with
the
scarlet
swirls.
“What
do
you
feel?”

“Shell,
hard
as
rock.”
The
knight
was
wary.
“Scales.”

“Heat?”

“No.
Cold
stone.”
He
took
his
hand
away.
“Princess,
are
you
well?
Should
you
be
up,
weak
as
you
are?”

“Weak?
I
am
strong,
Jorah.”
To
please
him,
she
reclined
on
a
pile
of
cushions.
“Tell
me
how
my
child
died.”

“He
never
lived,
my
princess.
The
women
say…”
He
faltered,
and
Dany
saw
how
the
flesh
hung
loose
on
him,
and
the
way
he
limped
when
he
moved.

“Tell
me.
Tell
me
what
the
women
say.”

He
turned
his
face
away.
His
eyes
were
haunted.
“They
say
the
child
was…”

She
waited,
but
Ser
Jorah
could
not
say
it.
His
face
grew
dark
with
shame.
He
looked
half
a
corpse
himself.

“Monstrous,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
finished
for
him.
The
knight
was
a
powerful
man,
yet
Dany
understood
in
that
moment
that
the
maegi
was
stronger,
and
crueler,
and
infinitely
more
dangerous.
“Twisted.
I
drew
him
forth
myself.
He
was
scaled
like
a
lizard,
blind,
with
the
stub
of
a
tail
and
small
leather
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
bat.
When
I
touched
him,
the
flesh
sloughed
off
the
bone,
and
inside
he
was
full
of
graveworms
and
the
stink
of
corruption.
He
had
been
dead
for
years.”

Darkness,
Dany
thought.
The
terrible
darkness
sweeping
up
behind
to
devour
her.
If
she
looked
back
she
was
lost.
“My
son
was
alive
and
strong
when
Ser
Jorah
carried
me
into
this
tent,”
she
said.
“I
could
feel
him
kicking,
fighting
to
be
born.”

“That
may
be
as
it
may
be,”
answered
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
“yet
the
creature
that
came
forth
from
your
womb
was
as
I
said.
Death
was
in
that
tent,
Khaleesi.”

“Only
shadows,”
Ser
Jorah
husked,
but
Dany
could
hear
the
doubt
in
his
voice.
“I
saw,
maegi.
I
saw
you,
alone,
dancing
with
the
shadows.
“

“The
grave
casts
long
shadows,
Iron
Lord,”
Mirri
said.
“Long
and
dark,
and
in
the
end
no
light
can
hold
them
back.”

Ser
Jorah
had
killed
her
son,
Dany
knew.
He
had
done
what
he
did
for
love
and
loyalty,
yet
he
had
carried
her
into
a
place
no
living
man
should
go
and
fed
her
baby
to
the
darkness.
He
knew
it
too;
the
grey
face,
the
hollow
eyes,
the
limp.
“The
shadows
have
touched
you
too,
Ser
Jorah,”
she
told
him.
The
knight
made
no
reply.
Dany
turned
to
the
godswife.
“You
warned
me
that
only
death
could
pay
for
life.
I
thought
you
meant
the
horse.”

“No,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said.
“That
was
a
lie
you
told
yourself.
You
knew
the
price.”

Had
she?
Had
she?
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“The
price
was
paid,”
Dany
said.
“The
horse,
my
child,
Quaro
and
Qotho,
Haggo
and
Cohollo.
The
price
was
paid
and
paid
and
paid.”
She
rose
from
her
cushions.
“Where
is
Khal
Drogo?
Show
him
to
me,
godswife,
maegi,
bloodmage,
whatever
you
are.
Show
me
Khal
Drogo.
Show
me
what
I
bought
with
my
son’s
life.”

“As
you
command,
Khaleesi,”
the
old
woman
said.
“Come,
I
will
take
you
to
him.”

Dany
was
weaker
than
she
knew.
Ser
Jorah
slipped
an
arm
around
her
and
helped
her
stand.
“Time
enough
for
this
later,
my
princess,”
he
said
quietly.

“I
would
see
him
now,
Ser
Jorah.”

After
the
dimness
of
the
tent,
the
world
outside
was
blinding
bright.
The
sun
burned
like
molten
gold,
and
the
land
was
seared
and
empty.
Her
handmaids
waited
with
fruit
and
wine
and
water,
and
Jhogo
moved
close
to
help
Ser
Jorah
support
her.
Aggo
and
Rakharo
stood
behind.
The
glare
of
sun
on
sand
made
it
hard
to
see
more,
until
Dany
raised
her
hand
to
shade
her
eyes.
She
saw
the
ashes
of
a
fire,
a
few
score
horses
milling
listlessly
and
searching
for
a
bite
of
grass,
a
scattering
of
tents
and
bedrolls.
A
small
crowd
of
children
had
gathered
to
watch
her,
and
beyond
she
glimpsed
women
going
about
their
work,
and
withered
old
men
staring
at
the
flat
blue
sky
with
tired
eyes,
swatting
feebly
at
bloodflies.
A
count
might
show
a
hundred
people,
no
more.
Where
the
other
forty
thousand
had
made
their
camp,
only
the
wind
and
dust
lived
now.

“Drogo’s
khalasar
is
gone,”
she
said.

“A
khal
who
cannot
ride
is
no
khal,”
said
Jhogo.

“The
Dothraki
follow
only
the
strong,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“I
am
sorry,
my
princess.
There
was
no
way
to
hold
them.
Ko
Pono
left
first,
naming
himself
Khal
Pono,
and
many
followed
him.
Jhaqo
was
not
long
to
do
the
same.
The
rest
slipped
away
night
by
night,
in
large
bands
and
small.
There
are
a
dozen
new
khalasars
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
where
once
there
was
only
Drogo’s.”

“The
old
remain,”
said
Aggo.
“The
frightened,
the
weak,
and
the
sick.
And
we
who
swore.
We
remain.”

“They
took
Khal
Drogo’s
herds,
Khaleesi,”
Rakharo
said.
“We
were
too
few
to
stop
them.
It
is
the
right
of
the
strong
to
take
from
the
weak.
They
took
many
slaves
as
well,
the
khal’s
and
yours,
yet
they
left
some
few.”

“Eroeh?”
asked
Dany,
remembering
the
frightened
child
she
had
saved
outside
the
city
of
the
Lamb
Men.

“Mago
seized
her,
who
is
Khal
Jhaqo’s
bloodrider
now,”
said
Jhogo.
“He
mounted
her
high
and
low
and
gave
her
to
his
khal,
and
Jhaqo
gave
her
to
his
other
bloodriders.
They
were
six.
When
they
were
done
with
her,
they
cut
her
throat.”

“It
was
her
fate,
Khaleesi,”
said
Aggo.

If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“It
was
a
cruel
fate,”
Dany
said,
“yet
not
so
cruel
as
Mago’s
will
be.
I
promise
you
that,
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new,
by
the
lamb
god
and
the
horse
god
and
every
god
that
lives.
I
swear
it
by
the
Mother
of
Mountains
and
the
Womb
of
the
World.
Before
I
am
done
with
them,
Mago
and
Ko
Jhaqo
will
plead
for
the
mercy
they
showed
Eroeh.”

The
Dothraki
exchanged
uncertain
glances.
“Khaleesi,”
the
handmaid
Irri
explained,
as
if
to
a
child,
“Jhaqo
is
a
khal
now,
with
twenty
thousand
riders
at
his
back.”

She
lifted
her
head.
“And
I
am
Daenerys
Stormhorn,
Daenerys
of
House
Targaryen,
of
the
blood
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
and
Maegor
the
Cruel
and
old
Valyria
before
them.
I
am
the
dragon’s
daughter,
and
I
swear
to
you,
these
men
will
die
screaming.
Now
bring
me
to
Khal
Drogo.”

He
was
lying
on
the
bare
red
earth,
staring
up
at
the
sun.

A
dozen
bloodflies
had
settled
on
his
body,
though
he
did
not
seem
to
feel
them.
Dany
brushed
them
away
and
knelt
beside
him.
His
eyes
were
wide
open
but
did
not
see,
and
she
knew
at
once
that
he
was
blind.
When
she
whispered
his
name,
he
did
not
seem
to
hear.
The
wound
on
his
breast
was
as
healed
as
it
would
ever
be,
the
scar
that
covered
it
grey
and
red
and
hideous.

“Why
is
he
out
here
alone,
in
the
sun?”
she
asked
them.

“He
seems
to
like
the
warmth,
Princess,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“His
eyes
follow
the
sun,
though
he
does
not
see
it.
He
can
walk
after
a
fashion.
He
will
go
where
you
lead
him,
but
no
farther.
He
will
eat
if
you
put
food
in
his
mouth,
drink
if
you
dribble
water
on
his
lips.”

Dany
kissed
her
sun-and-stars
gently
on
the
brow,
and
stood
to
face
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“Your
spells
are
costly,
maegi.”

“He
lives,”
said
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“You
asked
for
life.
You
paid
for
life.”

“This
is
not
life,
for
one
who
was
as
Drogo
was.
His
life
was
laughter,
and
meat
roasting
over
a
firepit,
and
a
horse
between
his
legs.
His
life
was
an
arakh
in
his
hand
and
his
bells
ringing
in
his
hair
as
he
rode
to
meet
an
enemy.
His
life
was
his
bloodriders,
and
me,
and
the
son
I
was
to
give
him.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
made
no
reply.

“When
will
he
be
as
he
was?”
Dany
demanded.

“When
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
and
sets
in
the
east,”
said
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“When
the
seas
go
dry
and
mountains
blow
in
the
wind
like
leaves.
When
your
womb
quickens
again,
and
you
bear
a
living
child.
Then
he
will
return,
and
not
before.”

Dany
gestured
at
Ser
Jorah
and
the
others.
“Leave
us.
I
would
speak
with
this
maegi
alone.”
Mormont
and
the
Dothraki
withdrew.
“You
knew,”
Dany
said
when
they
were
gone.
She
ached,
inside
and
out,
but
her
fury
gave
her
strength.
“You
knew
what
I
was
buying,
and
you
knew
the
price,
and
yet
you
let
me
pay
it.”

“It
was
wrong
of
them
to
burn
my
temple,”
the
heavy,
flat-nosed
woman
said
placidly.
“That
angered
the
Great
Shepherd.”

“This
was
no
god’s
work,”
Dany
said
coldly.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“You
cheated
me.
You
murdered
my
child
within
me.”

“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
will
burn
no
cities
now.
His
khalasar
shall
trample
no
nations
into
dust.”

“I
spoke
for
you,”
she
said,
anguished.
“I
saved
you.”

“Saved
me?”
The
Lhazareen
woman
spat.
“Three
riders
had
taken
me,
not
as
a
man
takes
a
woman
but
from
behind,
as
a
dog
takes
a
bitch.
The
fourth
was
in
me
when
you
rode
past.
How
then
did
you
save
me?
I
saw
my
god’s
house
burn,
where
I
had
healed
good
men
beyond
counting.
My
home
they
burned
as
well,
and
in
the
street
I
saw
piles
of
heads.
I
saw
the
head
of
a
baker
who
made
my
bread.
I
saw
the
head
of
a
boy
I
had
saved
from
deadeye
fever,
only
three
moons
past.
I
heard
children
crying
as
the
riders
drove
them
off
with
their
whips.
Tell
me
again
what
you
saved.”

“Your
life.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
laughed
cruelly.
“Look
to
your
khal
and
see
what
life
is
worth,
when
all
the
rest
is
gone.”

Dany
called
out
for
the
men
of
her
khas
and
bid
them
take
Mirri
Maz
Duur
and
bind
her
hand
and
foot,
but
the
maegi
smiled
at
her
as
they
carried
her
off,
as
if
they
shared
a
secret.
A
word,
and
Dany
could
have
her
head
off…
yet
then
what
would
she
have?
A
head?
If
life
was
worthless,
what
was
death?

They
led
Khal
Drogo
back
to
her
tent,
and
Dany
commanded
them
to
fill
a
tub,
and
this
time
there
was
no
blood
in
the
water.
She
bathed
him
herself,
washing
the
dirt
and
the
dust
from
his
arms
and
chest,
cleaning
his
face
with
a
soft
cloth,
soaping
his
long
black
hair
and
combing
the
knots
and
tangles
from
it
till
it
shone
again
as
she
remembered.
It
was
well
past
dark
before
she
was
done,
and
Dany
was
exhausted.
She
stopped
for
drink
and
food,
but
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
nibble
at
a
fig
and
keep
down
a
mouthful
of
water.
Sleep
would
have
been
a
release,
but
she
had
slept
enough…
too
long,
in
truth.
She
owed
this
night
to
Drogo,
for
all
the
nights
that
had
been,
and
yet
might
be.

The
memory
of
their
first
ride
was
with
her
when
she
led
him
out
into
the
darkness,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.
She
told
herself
that
there
were
powers
stronger
than
hatred,
and
spells
older
and
truer
than
any
the
maegi
had
learned
in
Asshai.
The
night
was
black
and
moonless,
but
overhead
a
million
stars
burned
bright.
She
took
that
for
an
omen.

No
soft
blanket
of
grass
welcomed
them
here,
only
the
hard
dusty
ground,
bare
and
strewn
with
stones.
No
trees
stirred
in
the
wind,
and
there
was
no
stream
to
soothe
her
fears
with
the
gentle
music
of
water.
Dany
told
herself
that
the
stars
would
be
enough.
“Remember,
Drogo,”
she
whispered.
“Remember
our
first
ride
together,
the
day
we
wed.
Remember
the
night
we
made
Rhaego,
with
the
khalasar
all
around
us
and
your
eyes
on
my
face.
Remember
how
cool
and
clean
the
water
was
in
the
Womb
of
the
World.
Remember,
my
sun-and-stars.
Remember,
and
come
back
to
me.”

The
birth
had
left
her
too
raw
and
torn
to
take
him
inside
of
her,
as
she
would
have
wanted,
but
Doreah
had
taught
her
other
ways.
Dany
used
her
hands,
her
mouth,
her
breasts.
She
raked
him
with
her
nails
and
covered
him
with
kisses
and
whispered
and
prayed
and
told
him
stories,
and
by
the
end
she
had
bathed
him
with
her
tears.
Yet
Drogo
did
not
feel,
or
speak,
or
rise.

And
when
the
bleak
dawn
broke
over
an
empty
horizon,
Dany
knew
that
he
was
truly
lost
to
her.
“When
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
and
sets
in
the
east,”
she
said
sadly.
“When
the
seas
go
dry
and
mountains
blow
in
the
wind
like
leaves.
When
my
womb
quickens
again,
and
I
bear
a
living
child.
Then
you
will
return,
my
sun-and-stars,
and
not
before.”

Never,
the
darkness
cried,
never
never
never.

Inside
the
tent
Dany
found
a
cushion,
soft
silk
stuffed
with
feathers.
She
clutched
it
to
her
breasts
as
she
walked
back
out
to
Drogo,
to
her
sun-and-stars.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
It
hurt
even
to
walk,
and
she
wanted
to
sleep,
to
sleep
and
not
to
dream.

She
knelt,
kissed
Drogo
on
the
lips,
and
pressed
the
cushion
down
across
his
face.

TYRION

<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
He
dreamed
of
a
cracked
stone
ceiling
and
the
smells
of
blood
and
shit
and
burnt
flesh.
The
air
was
full
of
acrid
smoke.
Men
were
groaning
and
whimpering
all
around
him,
and
from
time
to
time
a
scream
would
pierce
the
air,
thick
with
pain.
When
he
tried
to
move,
he
found
that
he
had
fouled
his
own
bedding.
The
smoke
in
the
air
made
his
eyes
water.
Am
I
crying?
He
must
not
let
his
father
see.
He
was
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock.
A
lion,
I
must
be
a
lion,
live
a
lion,
die
a
lion.
He
hurt
so
much,
though.
Too
weak
to
groan,
he
lay
in
his
own
filth
and
shut
his
eyes.
Nearby
someone
was
cursing
the
gods
in
a
heavy,
monotonous
voice.
He
listened
to
the
blasphemies
and
wondered
if
he
was
dying.
After
a
time
the
room
faded.

He
found
himself
outside
the
city,
walking
through
a
world
without
color.
Ravens
soared
through
a
grey
sky
on
wide
black
wings,
while
carrion
crows
rose
from
their
feasts
in
furious
clouds
wherever
he
set
his
steps.
White
maggots
burrowed
through
black
corruption.
The
wolves
were
grey,
and
so
were
the
silent
sisters;
together
they
stripped
the
flesh
from
the
fallen.
There
were
corpses
strewn
all
over
the
tourney
fields.
The
sun
was
a
hot
white
penny,
shining
down
upon
the
grey
river
as
it
rushed
around
the
charred
bones
of
sunken
ships.
From
the
pyres
of
the
dead
rose
black
columns
of
smoke
and
white-hot
ashes.
My
work,
thought
Tyrion
Lannister.
They
died
at
my
command.

At
first
there
was
no
sound
in
the
world,
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
dead,
soft
and
terrible.
They
wept
and
moaned,
they
begged
for
an
end
to
pain,
they
cried
for
help
and
wanted
their
mothers.
Tyrion
had
never
known
his
mother.
He
wanted
Shae,
but
she
was
not
there.
He
walked
alone
amidst
grey
shadows,
trying
to
remember…

The
silent
sisters
were
stripping
the
dead
men
of
their
armor
and
clothes.
All
the
bright
dyes
had
leached
out
from
the
surcoats
of
the
slain;
they
were
garbed
in
shades
of
white
and
grey,
and
their
blood
was
black
and
crusty.
He
watched
their
naked
bodies
lifted
by
arm
and
leg,
to
be
carried
swinging
to
the
pyres
to
join
their
fellows.
Metal
and
cloth
were
thrown
in
the
back
of
a
white
wooden
wagon,
pulled
by
two
tall
black
horses.

So
many
dead,
so
very
many.
Their
corpses
hung
limply,
their
faces
slack
or
stiff
or
swollen
with
gas,
unrecognizable,
hardly
human.
The
garments
the
sisters
took
from
them
were
decorated
with
black
hearts,
grey
lions,
dead
flowers,
and
pale
ghostly
stags.
Their
armor
was
all
dented
and
gashed,
the
chainmail
riven,
broken,
slashed.
Why
did
I
kill
them
all?
He
had
known
once,
but
somehow
he
had
forgotten.

He
would
have
asked
one
of
the
silent
sisters,
but
when
he
tried
to
speak
he
found
he
had
no
mouth.
Smooth
seamless
skin
covered
his
teeth.
The
discovery
terrified
him.
How
could
he
live
without
a
mouth?
He
began
to
run.
The
city
was
not
far.
He
would
be
safe
inside
the
city,
away
from
all
these
dead.
He
did
not
belong
with
the
dead.
He
had
no
mouth,
but
he
was
still
a
living
man.
No,
a
lion,
a
lion,
and
alive.
But
when
he
reached
the
city
walls,
the
gates
were
shut
against
him.

It
was
dark
when
he
woke
again.
At
first
he
could
see
nothing,
but
after
a
time
the
vague
outlines
of
a
bed
appeared
around
him.
The
drapes
were
drawn,
but
he
could
see
the
shape
of
carved
bedposts,
and
the
droop
of
the
velvet
canopy
over
his
head.
Under
him
was
the
yielding
softness
of
a
featherbed,
and
the
pillow
beneath
his
head
was
goose
down.
My
own
bed,
I
am
in
my
own
bed,
in
my
own
bedchamber.

It
was
warm
inside
the
drapes,
under
the
great
heap
of
furs
and
blankets
that
covered
him.
He
was
sweating.
Fever,
he
thought
groggily.
He
felt
so
weak,
and
the
pain
stabbed
through
him
when
he
struggled
to
lift
his
hand.
He
gave
up
the
effort.
His
head
felt
enormous,
as
big
as
the
bed,
too
heavy
to
raise
from
the
pillow.
His
body
he
could
scarcely
feel
at
all.
How
did
I
come
here?
He
tried
to
remember.
The
battle
came
back
in
fits
and
flashes.
The
fight
along
the
river,
the
knight
who’d
offered
up
his
gauntlet,
the
bridge
of
ships…

Ser
Mandon.
He
saw
the
dead
empty
eyes,
the
reaching
hand,
the
green
fire
shining
against
the
white
enamel
plate.
Fear
swept
over
him
in
a
cold
rush;
beneath
the
sheets
he
could
feel
his
bladder
letting
go.
He
would
have
cried
out,
if
he’d
had
a
mouth.
No,
that
was
the
dream,
he
thought,
his
head
pounding.
Help
me,
someone
help
me.
Jaime,
Shae,
Mother,
someone…
Tysha…

No
one
heard.
No
one
came.
Alone
in
the
dark,
he
fell
back
into
piss-scented
sleep.
He
dreamed
his
sister
was
standing
over
his
bed,
with
their
lord
father
beside
her,
frowning.
It
had
to
be
a
dream,
since
Lord
Tywin
was
a
thousand
leagues
away,
fighting
Robb
Stark
in
the
west.
Others
came
and
went
as
well.
Varys
looked
down
on
him
and
sighed,
but
Littlefinger
made
a
quip.
Bloody
treacherous
bastard,
Tyrion
thought
venomously,
we
sent
you
to
Bitterbridge
and
you
never
came
back.
Sometimes
he
could
hear
them
talking
to
one
another,
but
he
did
not
understand
the
words.
Their
voices
buzzed
in
his
ears
like
wasps
muffled
in
thick
felt.

He
wanted
to
ask
if
they’d
won
the
battle.
We
must
have,
else
I’d
be
a
head
on
a
spike
somewhere.
If
I
live,
we
won.
He
did
not
know
what
pleased
him
more:
the
victory,
or
the
fact
he
had
been
able
to
reason
it
out.
His
wits
were
coming
back
to
him,
however
slowly.
That
was
good.
His
wits
were
all
he
had.

The
next
time
he
woke,
the
draperies
had
been
pulled
back,
and
Podrick
Payne
stood
over
him
with
a
candle.
When
he
saw
Tyrion
open
his
eyes
he
ran
off.
No,
don’t
go,
help
me,
help,
he
tried
to
call,
but
the
best
he
could
do
was
a
muffled
moan.
I
have
no
mouth.
He
raised
a
hand
to
his
face,
his
every
movement
pained
and
fumbling.
His
fingers
found
stiff
cloth
where
they
should
have
found
flesh,
lips,
teeth.
Linen.
The
lower
half
of
his
face
was
bandaged
tightly,
a
mask
of
hardened
plaster
with
holes
for
breathing
and
feeding.

A
short
while
later
Pod
reappeared.
This
time
a
stranger
was
with
him,
a
maester
chained
and
robed.
“My
lord,
you
must
be
still,”
the
man
murmured.
“You
are
grievous
hurt.
You
will
do
yourself
great
injury.
Are
you
thirsty?”

He
managed
an
awkward
nod.
The
maester
inserted
a
curved
copper
funnel
through
the
feeding
hole
over
his
mouth
and
poured
a
slow
trickle
down
his
throat.
Tyrion
swallowed,
scarcely
tasting.
Too
late
he
realized
the
liquid
was
milk
of
the
poppy.
By
the
time
the
maester
removed
the
funnel
from
his
mouth,
he
was
already
spiraling
back
to
sleep.

This
time
he
dreamed
he
was
at
a
feast,
a
victory
feast
in
some
great
hall.
He
had
a
high
seat
on
the
dais,
and
men
were
lifting
their
goblets
and
hailing
him
as
hero.
Marillion
was
there,
the
singer
who’d
journeyed
with
them
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
He
played
his
woodharp
and
sang
of
the
Imp’s
daring
deeds.
Even
his
father
was
smiling
with
approval.
When
the
song
was
over,
Jaime
rose
from
his
place,
commanded
Tyrion
to
kneel,
and
touched
him
first
on
one
shoulder
and
then
on
the
other
with
his
golden
sword,
and
he
rose
up
a
knight.
Shae
was
waiting
to
embrace
him.
She
took
him
by
the
hand,
laughing
and
teasing,
calling
him
her
giant
of
Lannister.

He
woke
in
darkness
to
a
cold
empty
room.
The
draperies
had
been
drawn
again.
Something
felt
wrong,
turned
around,
though
he
could
not
have
said
what.
He
was
alone
once
more.
Pushing
back
the
blankets,
he
tried
to
sit,
but
the
pain
was
too
much
and
he
soon
subsided,
breathing
raggedly.
His
face
was
the
least
part
of
it.
His
right
side
was
one
huge
ache,
and
a
stab
of
pain
went
through
his
chest
whenever
he
lifted
his
arm.
What’s
happened
to
me?
Even
the
battle
seemed
half
a
dream
when
he
tried
to
think
back
on
it.
I
was
hurt
more
badly
than
I
knew.
Ser
Mandon…

The
memory
frightened
him,
but
Tyrion
made
himself
hold
it,
turn
it
in
his
head,
stare
at
it
hard.
He
tried
to
kill
me,
no
mistake.
That
part
was
not
a
dream.
He
would
have
cut
me
in
half
if
Pod
had
not…
Pod,
where’s
Pod?

Gritting
his
teeth,
he
grabbed
hold
of
the
bed
hangings
and
yanked.
The
drapes
ripped
free
of
the
canopy
overhead
and
tumbled
down,
half
on
the
rushes
and
half
on
him.
Even
that
small
effort
had
dizzied
him.
The
room
whirled
around
him,
all
bare
walls
and
dark
shadows,
with
a
single
narrow
window.
He
saw
a
chest
he’d
owned,
an
untidy
pile
of
his
clothing,
his
battered
armor.
This
is
not
my
bedchamber,
he
realized.
Not
even
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
Someone
had
moved
him.
His
shout
of
anger
came
out
as
a
muffled
moan.
They
have
moved
me
here
to
die,
he
thought
as
he
gave
up
the
struggle
and
closed
his
eyes
once
more.
The
room
was
dank
and
cold,
and
he
was
burning.

He
dreamed
of
a
better
place,
a
snug
little
cottage
by
the
sunset
sea.
The
walls
were
lopsided
and
cracked
and
the
floor
had
been
made
of
packed
earth,
but
he
had
always
been
warm
there,
even
when
they
let
the
fire
go
out.
She
used
to
tease
me
about
that,
he
remembered.
I
never
thought
to
feed
the
fire,
that
had
always
been
a
servant’s
task.
“We
have
no
servants,”
she
would
remind
me,
and
I
would
say,
“You
have
me,
I’m
your
servant,”
and
she
would
say,
“A
lazy
servant.
What
do
they
do
with
lazy
servants
in
Casterly
Rock,
my
lord?”
and
he
would
tell
her,
“They
kiss
them.”
That
would
always
make
her
giggle.
“They
do
not
neither.
They
beat
them,
I
bet,”
she
would
say,
but
he
would
insist,
“No,
they
kiss
them,
just
like
this.”
He
would
show
her
how.
“They
kiss
their
fingers
first,
every
one,
and
they
kiss
their
wrists,
yes,
and
inside
their
elbows.
Then
they
kiss
their
funny
ears,
all
our
servants
have
funny
ears.
Stop
laughing!
And
they
kiss
their
cheeks
and
they
kiss
their
noses
with
the
little
bump
in
them,
there,
so,
like
that,
and
they
kiss
their
sweet
brows
and
their
hair
and
their
lips,
their…
mmmm…
mouths…
so…”

They
would
kiss
for
hours,
and
spend
whole
days
doing
no
more
than
lolling
in
bed,
listening
to
the
waves,
and
touching
each
other.
Her
body
was
a
wonder
to
him,
and
she
seemed
to
find
delight
in
his.
Sometimes
she
would
sing
to
him.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
with
sunlight
in
her
hair.
“I
love
you,
Tyrion,”
she
would
whisper
before
they
went
to
sleep
at
night.
“I
love
your
lips.
I
love
your
voice,
and
the
words
you
say
to
me,
and
how
you
treat
me
gentle.
I
love
your
face.”

“My
face?”

“Yes.
Yes.
I
love
your
hands,
and
how
you
touch
me.
Your
cock,
I
love
your
cock,
I
love
how
it
feels
when
it’s
in
me.”

“It
loves
you
too,
my
lady.”

“I
love
to
say
your
name.
Tyrion
Lannister.
It
goes
with
mine.
Not
the
Lannister,
t’other
part.
Tyrion
and
Tysha.
Tysha
and
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
My
lord
Tyrion…”

Lies,
he
thought,
all
feigned,
all
for
gold,
she
was
a
whore,
Jaime’s
whore,
Jaime’s
gift,
my
lady
of
the
lie.
Her
face
seemed
to
fade
away,
dissolving
behind
a
veil
of
tears,
but
even
after
she
was
gone
he
could
still
hear
the
faint,
far-off
sound
of
her
voice,
calling
his
name.
“…my
lord,
can
you
hear
me?
My
lord?
Tyrion?
My
lord?
My
lord?”

Through
a
haze
of
poppied
sleep,
he
saw
a
soft
pink
face
leaning
over
him.
He
was
back
in
the
dank
room
with
the
torn
bed
hangings,
and
the
face
was
wrong,
not
hers,
too
round,
with
a
brown
fringe
of
beard.
“Do
you
thirst,
my
lord?
I
have
your
milk,
your
good
milk.
You
must
not
fight,
no,
don’t
try
to
move,
you
need
your
rest.”
He
had
the
copper
funnel
in
one
damp
pink
hand
and
a
flask
in
the
other.

As
the
man
leaned
close,
Tyrion’s
fingers
slid
underneath
his
chain
of
many
metals,
grabbed,
pulled.
The
maester
dropped
the
flask,
spilling
milk
of
the
poppy
all
over
the
blanket.
Tyrion
twisted
until
he
could
feel
the
links
digging
into
the
flesh
of
the
man’s
fat
neck.
“No.
More,”
he
croaked,
so
hoarse
he
was
not
certain
he
had
even
spoken.
But
he
must
have,
for
the
maester
choked
out
a
reply.
“Unhand,
please,
my
lord…
need
your
milk,
the
pain…
the
chain,
don’t,
unhand,
no…”

The
pink
face
was
beginning
to
purple
when
Tyrion
let
go.
The
maester
reeled
back,
sucking
in
air.
His
reddened
throat
showed
deep
white
gouges
where
the
links
had
pressed.
His
eyes
were
white
too.
Tyrion
raised
a
hand
to
his
face
and
made
a
ripping
motion
over
the
hardened
mask.
And
again.
And
again.

“You…
you
want
the
bandages
off,
is
that
it?”
the
maester
said
at
last.
“But
I’m
not
to…
that
would
be…
be
most
unwise,
my
lord.
You
are
not
yet
healed,
the
queen
would…”

The
mention
of
his
sister
made
Tyrion
growl.
Are
you
one
of
hers,
then?
He
pointed
a
finger
at
the
maester,
then
coiled
his
hand
into
a
fist.
Crushing,
choking,
a
promise,
unless
the
fool
did
as
he
was
bid.

Thankfully,
he
understood.
“I…
I
will
do
as
my
lord
commands,
to
be
sure,
but…
this
is
unwise,
your
wounds…”

“Do.
It.”
Louder
that
time.

Bowing,
the
man
left
the
room,
only
to
return
a
few
moments
later,
bearing
a
long
knife
with
a
slender
sawtooth
blade,
a
basin
of
water,
a
pile
of
soft
cloths,
and
several
flasks.
By
then
Tyrion
had
managed
to
squirm
backward
a
few
inches,
so
he
was
half
sitting
against
his
pillow.
The
maester
bade
him
be
very
still
as
he
slid
the
tip
of
the
knife
in
under
his
chin,
beneath
the
mask.
A
slip
of
the
hand
here,
and
Cersei
will
be
free
of
me,
he
thought.
He
could
feel
the
blade
sawing
through
the
stiffened
linen,
only
inches
above
his
throat.

Fortunately
this
soft
pink
man
was
not
one
of
his
sister’s
braver
creatures.
After
a
moment
he
felt
cool
air
on
his
cheeks.
There
was
pain
as
well,
but
he
did
his
best
to
ignore
that.
The
maester
discarded
the
bandages,
still
crusty
with
potion.
“Be
still
now,
I
must
wash
out
the
wound.”
His
touch
was
gentle,
the
water
warm
and
soothing.
The
wound,
Tyrion
thought,
remembering
a
sudden
flash
of
bright
silver
that
seemed
to
pass
just
below
his
eyes.
“This
is
like
to
sting
some,”
the
maester
warned
as
he
wet
a
cloth
with
wine
that
smelled
of
crushed
herbs.
It
did
more
than
sting.
It
traced
a
line
of
fire
all
the
way
across
Tyrion’s
face,
and
twisted
a
burning
poker
up
his
nose.
His
fingers
clawed
the
bedclothes
and
he
sucked
in
his
breath,
but
somehow
he
managed
not
to
scream.
The
maester
was
clucking
like
an
old
hen.
“It
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
the
mask
in
place
until
the
flesh
had
knit,
my
lord.
Still,
it
looks
clean,
good,
good.
When
we
found
you
down
in
that
cellar
among
the
dead
and
dying,
your
wounds
were
filthy.
One
of
your
ribs
was
broken,
doubtless
you
can
feel
it,
the
blow
of
some
mace
perhaps,
or
a
fall,
it’s
hard
to
say.
And
you
took
an
arrow
in
the
arm,
there
where
it
joins
the
shoulder.
It
showed
signs
of
mortification,
and
for
a
time
I
feared
you
might
lose
the
limb,
but
we
treated
it
with
boiling
wine
and
maggots,
and
now
it
seems
to
be
healing
clean…”

“Name,”
Tyrion
breathed
up
at
him.
“Name.”

The
maester
blinked.
“Why,
you
are
Tyrion
Lannister,
my
lord.
Brother
to
the
queen.
Do
you
remember
the
battle?
Sometimes
with
head
wounds—”

“Your
name.”
His
throat
was
raw,
and
his
tongue
had
forgotten
how
to
shape
the
words.

“I
am
Maester
Ballabar.”

“Ballabar,”
Tyrion
repeated.
“Bring
me.
Looking
glass.”

“My
lord,”
the
maester
said,
“I
would
not
counsel…
that
might
be,
ah,
unwise,
as
it
were…
your
wound…”

“Bring
it,”
he
had
to
say.
His
mouth
was
stiff
and
sore,
as
if
a
punch
had
split
his
lip.
“And
drink.
Wine.
No
poppy.”

The
maester
rose
flush-faced
and
hurried
off.
He
came
back
with
a
flagon
of
pale
amber
wine
and
a
small
silvered
looking
glass
in
an
ornate
golden
frame.
Sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed,
he
poured
half
a
cup
of
wine
and
held
it
to
Tyrion’s
swollen
lips.
The
trickle
went
down
cool,
though
he
could
hardly
taste
it.
“More,”
he
said
when
the
cup
was
empty.
Maester
Ballabar
poured
again.
By
the
end
of
the
second
cup,
Tyrion
Lannister
felt
strong
enough
to
face
his
face.

He
turned
over
the
glass,
and
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry.
The
gash
was
long
and
crooked,
starting
a
hair
under
his
left
eye
and
ending
on
the
right
side
of
his
jaw.
Three-quarters
of
his
nose
was
gone,
and
a
chunk
of
his
lip.
Someone
had
sewn
the
torn
flesh
together
with
catgut,
and
their
clumsy
stitches
were
still
in
place
across
the
seam
of
raw,
red,
half-healed
flesh.
“Pretty,”
he
croaked,
flinging
the
glass
aside.

He
remembered
now.
The
bridge
of
boats,
Ser
Mandon
Moore,
a
hand,
a
sword
coming
at
his
face.
If
I
had
not
pulled
back,
that
cut
would
have
taken
off
the
top
of
my
head.
Jaime
had
always
said
that
Ser
Mandon
was
the
most
dangerous
of
the
Kingsguard,
because
his
dead
empty
eyes
gave
no
hint
to
his
intentions.
I
should
never
have
trusted
any
of
them.
He’d
known
that
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Boros
were
his
sister’s,
and
Ser
Osmund
later,
but
he
had
let
himself
believe
that
the
others
were
not
wholly
lost
to
honor.
Cersei
must
have
paid
him
to
see
that
I
never
came
back
from
the
battle.
Why
else?
I
never
did
Ser
Mandon
any
harm
that
I
know
of.
Tyrion
touched
his
face,
plucking
at
the
proud
flesh
with
blunt
thick
fingers.
Another
gift
from
my
sweet
sister.

The
maester
stood
beside
the
bed
like
a
goose
about
to
take
flight.
“My
lord,
there,
there
will
most
like
be
a
scar…”

“Most
like?”
His
snort
of
laughter
turned
into
a
wince
of
pain.
There
would
be
a
scar,
to
be
sure.
Nor
was
it
likely
that
his
nose
would
be
growing
back
anytime
soon.
It
was
not
as
if
his
face
had
ever
been
fit
to
look
at.
“Teach
me,
not
to,
play
with,
axes.”
His
grin
felt
tight.
“Where,
are
we?
What,
what
place?”
It
hurt
to
talk,
but
Tyrion
had
been
too
long
in
silence.

“Ah,
you
are
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
my
lord.
A
chamber
over
the
Queen’s
Ballroom.
Her
Grace
wanted
you
kept
close,
so
she
might
watch
over
you
herself.”

I’ll
wager
she
did.
“Return
me,”
Tyrion
commanded.
“Own
bed.
Own
chambers.”
Where
I
will
have
my
own
men
about
me,
and
my
own
maester
too,
if
I
find
one
I
can
trust.

“Your
own…
my
lord,
that
would
not
be
possible.
The
King’s
Hand
has
taken
up
residence
in
your
former
chambers.”

“I.
Am.
King’s
Hand.”
He
was
growing
exhausted
by
the
effort
of
speaking,
and
confused
by
what
he
was
hearing.

Maester
Ballabar
looked
distressed.
“No,
my
lord,
I…
you
were
wounded,
near
death.
Your
lord
father
has
taken
up
those
duties
now.
Lord
Tywin,
he…”

“Here?”

“Since
the
night
of
the
battle.
Lord
Tywin
saved
us
all.
The
smallfolk
say
it
was
King
Renly’s
ghost,
but
wiser
men
know
better.
It
was
your
father
and
Lord
Tyrell,
with
the
Knight
of
Flowers
and
Lord
Littlefinger.
They
rode
through
the
ashes
and
took
the
usurper
Stannis
in
the
rear.
It
was
a
great
victory,
and
now
Lord
Tywin
has
settled
into
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
to
help
His
Grace
set
the
realm
to
rights,
gods
be
praised.”

“Gods
be
praised,”
Tyrion
repeated
hollowly.
His
bloody
father
and
bloody
Littlefinger
and
Renly’s
ghost?
“I
want…”
Who
do
I
want?
He
could
not
tell
pink
Ballabar
to
fetch
him
Shae.
Who
could
he
send
for,
who
could
he
trust?
Varys?
Bronn?
Ser
Jacelyn?
“…my
squire,”
he
finished.
“Pod.
Payne.”
It
was
Pod
on
the
bridge
of
boats,
the
lad
saved
my
life.

“The
boy?
The
odd
boy?”

“Odd
boy.
Podrick.
Payne.
You
go.
Send
him.”

“As
you
will,
my
lord.”
Maester
Ballabar
bobbed
his
head
and
hurried
out.
Tyrion
could
feel
the
strength
seeping
out
of
him
as
he
waited.
He
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
here,
asleep.
Cersei
would
have
me
sleep
forever,
but
I
won’t
be
so
obliging.

Podrick
Payne
entered
the
bedchamber
timid
as
a
mouse.
“My
lord?”
He
crept
close
to
the
bed.
How
can
a
boy
so
bold
in
battle
be
so
frightened
in
a
sickroom?
Tyrion
wondered.
“I
meant
to
stay
by
you,
but
the
maester
sent
me
away.”

“Send
him
away.
Hear
me.
Talk’s
hard.
Need
dreamwine.
Dreamwine,
not
milk
of
the
poppy.
Go
to
Frenken.
Frenken,
not
Ballabar.
Watch
him
make
it.
Bring
it
here.”
Pod
stole
a
glance
at
Tyrion’s
face,
and
just
as
quickly
averted
his
eyes.
Well,
I
cannot
blame
him
for
that.
“I
want,”
Tyrion
went
on,
“mine
own.
Guard.
Bronn.
Where’s
Bronn?”

“They
made
him
a
knight.”

Even
frowning
hurt.
“Find
him.
Bring
him.”

“As
you
say.
My
lord.
Bronn.”

Tyrion
seized
the
lad’s
wrist.
“Ser
Mandon?”

The
boy
flinched.
“I
n-never
meant
to
k-k-k-k—”

“Dead?
You’re,
certain?
Dead?”

He
shuffled
his
feet,
sheepish.
“Drowned.”

“Good.
Say
nothing.
Of
him.
Of
me.
Any
of
it.
Nothing.”

By
the
time
his
squire
left,
the
last
of
Tyrion’s
strength
was
gone
as
well.
He
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes.
Perhaps
he
would
dream
of
Tysha
again.
I
wonder
how
she’d
like
my
face
now,
he
thought
bitterly.





JON

When
Qhorin
Halfhand
told
him
to
find
some
brush
for
a
fire,
Jon
knew
their
end
was
near.

It
will
be
good
to
feel
warm
again,
if
only
for
a
little
while,
he
told
himself
while
he
hacked
bare
branches
from
the
trunk
of
a
dead
tree.
Ghost
sat
on
his
haunches
watching,
silent
as
ever.
Will
he
howl
for
me
when
I’m
dead,
as
Bran’s
wolf
howled
when
he
fell?
Jon
wondered.
Will
Shaggydog
howl,
far
off
in
Winterfell,
and
Grey
Wind
and
Nymeria,
wherever
they
might
be?

The
moon
was
rising
behind
one
mountain
and
the
sun
sinking
behind
another
as
Jon
struck
sparks
from
flint
and
dagger,
until
finally
a
wisp
of
smoke
appeared.
Qhorin
came
and
stood
over
him
as
the
first
flame
rose
up
flickering
from
the
shavings
of
bark
and
dead
dry
pine
needles.
“As
shy
as
a
maid
on
her
wedding
night,”
the
big
ranger
said
in
a
soft
voice,
“and
near
as
fair.
Sometimes
a
man
forgets
how
pretty
a
fire
can
be.”

He
was
not
a
man
you’d
expect
to
speak
of
maids
and
wedding
nights.
So
far
as
Jon
knew,
Qhorin
had
spent
his
whole
life
in
the
Watch.
Did
he
ever
love
a
maid
or
have
a
wedding?
He
could
not
ask.
Instead
he
fanned
the
fire.
When
the
blaze
was
all
acrackle,
he
peeled
off
his
stiff
gloves
to
warm
his
hands,
and
sighed,
wondering
if
ever
a
kiss
had
felt
as
good.
The
warmth
spread
through
his
fingers
like
melting
butter.

The
Halfhand
eased
himself
to
the
ground
and
sat
cross-legged
by
the
fire,
the
flickering
light
playing
across
the
hard
planes
of
his
face.
Only
the
two
of
them
remained
of
the
five
rangers
who
had
fled
the
Skirling
Pass,
back
into
the
blue-grey
wilderness
of
the
Frostfangs.

At
first
Jon
had
nursed
the
hope
that
Squire
Dalbridge
would
keep
the
wildlings
bottled
up
in
the
pass.
But
when
they’d
heard
the
call
of
a
far-off
horn
every
man
of
them
knew
the
squire
had
fallen.
Later
they
spied
the
eagle
soaring
through
the
dusk
on
great
blue-grey
wings
and
Stonesnake
unslung
his
bow,
but
the
bird
flew
out
of
range
before
he
could
so
much
as
string
it.
Ebben
spat
and
muttered
darkly
of
wargs
and
skinchangers.

They
glimpsed
the
eagle
twice
more
the
day
after,
and
heard
the
hunting
horn
behind
them
echoing
against
the
mountains.
Each
time
it
seemed
a
little
louder,
a
little
closer.
When
night
fell,
the
Halfhand
told
Ebben
to
take
the
squire’s
garron
as
well
as
his
own,
and
ride
east
for
Mormont
with
all
haste,
back
the
way
they
had
come.
The
rest
of
them
would
draw
off
the
pursuit.
“Send
Jon,”
Ebben
had
urged.
“He
can
ride
as
fast
as
me.”

“Jon
has
a
different
part
to
play.”

“He
is
half
a
boy
still.”

“No,”
said
Qhorin,
“he
is
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”

When
the
moon
rose,
Ebben
parted
from
them.
Stonesnake
went
east
with
him
a
short
way,
then
doubled
back
to
obscure
their
tracks,
and
the
three
who
remained
set
off
toward
the
southwest.

After
that
the
days
and
nights
blurred
one
into
the
other.
They
slept
in
their
saddles
and
stopped
only
long
enough
to
feed
and
water
the
garrons,
then
mounted
up
again.
Over
bare
rock
they
rode,
through
gloomy
pine
forests
and
drifts
of
old
snow,
over
icy
ridges
and
across
shallow
rivers
that
had
no
names.
Sometimes
Qhorin
or
Stonesnake
would
loop
back
to
sweep
away
their
tracks,
but
it
was
a
futile
gesture.
They
were
watched.
At
every
dawn
and
every
dusk
they
saw
the
eagle
soaring
between
the
peaks,
no
more
than
a
speck
in
the
vastness
of
the
sky.

They
were
scaling
a
low
ridge
between
two
snowcapped
peaks
when
a
shadowcat
came
snarling
from
its
lair,
not
ten
yards
away.
The
beast
was
gaunt
and
half-starved,
but
the
sight
of
it
sent
Stonesnake’s
mare
into
a
panic;
she
reared
and
ran,
and
before
the
ranger
could
get
her
back
under
control
she
had
stumbled
on
the
steep
slope
and
broken
a
leg.

Ghost
ate
well
that
day,
and
Qhorin
insisted
that
the
rangers
mix
some
of
the
garron’s
blood
with
their
oats,
to
give
them
strength.
The
taste
of
that
foul
porridge
almost
choked
Jon,
but
he
forced
it
down.
They
each
cut
a
dozen
strips
of
raw
stringy
meat
from
the
carcass
to
chew
on
as
they
rode,
and
left
the
rest
for
the
shadowcats.

There
was
no
question
of
riding
double.
Stonesnake
offered
to
lay
in
wait
for
the
pursuit
and
surprise
them
when
they
came.
Perhaps
he
could
take
a
few
of
them
with
him
down
to
hell.
Qhorin
refused.
“If
any
man
in
the
Night’s
Watch
can
make
it
through
the
Frostfangs
alone
and
afoot,
it
is
you,
brother.
You
can
go
over
mountains
that
a
horse
must
go
around.
Make
for
the
Fist.
Tell
Mormont
what
Jon
saw,
and
how.
Tell
him
that
the
old
powers
are
waking,
that
he
faces
giants
and
wargs
and
worse.
Tell
him
that
the
trees
have
eyes
again.”

He
has
no
chance,
Jon
thought
when
he
watched
Stonesnake
vanish
over
a
snow-covered
ridge,
a
tiny
black
bug
crawling
across
a
rippling
expanse
of
white.

After
that,
every
night
seemed
colder
than
the
night
before,
and
more
lonely.
Ghost
was
not
always
with
them,
but
he
was
never
far
either.
Even
when
they
were
apart,
Jon
sensed
his
nearness.
He
was
glad
for
that.
The
Halfhand
was
not
the
most
companionable
of
men.
Qhorin’s
long
grey
braid
swung
slowly
with
the
motion
of
his
horse.
Often
they
would
ride
for
hours
without
a
word
spoken,
the
only
sounds
the
soft
scrape
of
horseshoes
on
stone
and
the
keening
of
the
wind,
which
blew
endlessly
through
the
heights.
When
he
slept,
he
did
not
dream;
not
of
wolves,
nor
his
brothers,
nor
anything.
Even
dreams
cannot
live
up
here,
he
told
himself.

“Is
your
sword
sharp,
Jon
Snow?”
asked
Qhorin
Halfhand
across
the
flickering
fire.

“My
sword
is
Valyrian
steel.
The
Old
Bear
gave
it
to
me.”

“Do
you
remember
the
words
of
your
vow?”

“Yes.”
They
were
not
words
a
man
was
like
to
forget.
Once
said,
they
could
never
be
unsaid.
They
changed
your
life
forever.

“Say
them
again
with
me,
Jon
Snow.”

“If
you
like.”
Their
voices
blended
as
one
beneath
the
rising
moon,
while
Ghost
listened
and
the
mountains
themselves
bore
witness.
“Night
gathers,
and
now
my
watch
begins.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.
I
shall
take
no
wife,
hold
no
lands,
father
no
children.
I
shall
wear
no
crowns
and
win
no
glory.
I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post.
I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
I
am
the
watcher
on
the
walls.
I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.
I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
for
this
night
and
all
the
nights
to
come.”

When
they
were
done,
there
was
no
sound
but
the
faint
crackle
of
the
flames
and
a
distant
sigh
of
wind.
Jon
opened
and
closed
his
burnt
fingers,
holding
tight
to
the
words
in
his
mind,
praying
that
his
father’s
gods
would
give
him
the
strength
to
die
bravely
when
his
hour
came.
It
would
not
be
long
now.
The
garrons
were
near
the
end
of
their
strength.
Qhorin’s
mount
would
not
last
another
day,
Jon
suspected.

The
flames
were
burning
low
by
then,
the
warmth
fading.
“The
fire
will
soon
go
out,”
Qhorin
said,
“but
if
the
Wall
should
ever
fall,
all
the
fires
will
go
out.”

There
was
nothing
Jon
could
say
to
that.
He
nodded.

“We
may
escape
them
yet,”
the
ranger
said.
“Or
not.”

“I’m
not
afraid
to
die.”
It
was
only
half
a
lie.

“It
may
not
be
so
easy
as
that,
Jon.”

He
did
not
understand.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“If
we
are
taken,
you
must
yield.”

“Yield?”
He
blinked
in
disbelief.
The
wildlings
did
not
make
captives
of
the
men
they
called
the
crows.
They
killed
them,
except
for…“They
only
spare
oathbreakers.
Those
who
join
them,
like
Mance
Rayder.”

“And
you.”

“No.”
He
shook
his
head.
“Never.
I
won’t.”

“You
will.
I
command
it
of
you.”

“Command
it?
But…”

“Our
honor
means
no
more
than
our
lives,
so
long
as
the
realm
is
safe.
Are
you
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch?”

“Yes,
but—”

“There
is
no
but,
Jon
Snow.
You
are,
or
you
are
not.”

Jon
sat
up
straight.
“I
am.”

“Then
hear
me.
If
we
are
taken,
you
will
go
over
to
them,
as
the
wildling
girl
you
captured
once
urged
you.
They
may
demand
that
you
cut
your
cloak
to
ribbons,
that
you
swear
them
an
oath
on
your
father’s
grave,
that
you
curse
your
brothers
and
your
Lord
Commander.
You
must
not
balk,
whatever
is
asked
of
you.
Do
as
they
bid
you…
but
in
your
heart,
remember
who
and
what
you
are.
Ride
with
them,
eat
with
them,
fight
with
them,
for
as
long
as
it
takes.
And
watch.”

“For
what?”
Jon
asked.

“Would
that
I
knew,”
said
Qhorin.
“Your
wolf
saw
their
diggings
in
the
valley
of
the
Milkwater.
What
did
they
seek,
in
such
a
bleak
and
distant
place?
Did
they
find
it?
That
is
what
you
must
learn,
before
you
return
to
Lord
Mormont
and
your
brothers.
That
is
the
duty
I
lay
on
you,
Jon
Snow.”

“I’ll
do
as
you
say,”
Jon
said
reluctantly,
“but…
you
will
tell
them,
won’t
you?
The
Old
Bear,
at
least?
You’ll
tell
him
that
I
never
broke
my
oath.”

Qhorin
Halfhand
gazed
at
him
across
the
fire,
his
eyes
lost
in
pools
of
shadow.
“When
I
see
him
next.
I
swear
it.”
He
gestured
at
the
fire.
“More
wood.
I
want
it
bright
and
hot.”

Jon
went
to
cut
more
branches,
snapping
each
one
in
two
before
tossing
it
into
the
flames.
The
tree
had
been
dead
a
long
time,
but
it
seemed
to
live
again
in
the
fire,
as
fiery
dancers
woke
within
each
stick
of
wood
to
whirl
and
spin
in
their
glowing
gowns
of
yellow,
red,
and
orange.

“Enough,”
Qhorin
said
abruptly.
“Now
we
ride.”

“Ride?”
It
was
dark
beyond
the
fire,
and
the
night
was
cold.
“Ride
where?”

“Back.”
Qhorin
mounted
his
weary
garron
one
more
time.
“The
fire
will
draw
them
past,
I
hope.
Come,
brother.”

Jon
pulled
on
his
gloves
again
and
raised
his
hood.
Even
the
horses
seemed
reluctant
to
leave
the
fire.
The
sun
was
long
gone,
and
only
the
cold
silver
shine
of
the
half-moon
remained
to
light
their
way
over
the
treacherous
ground
that
lay
behind
them.
He
did
not
know
what
Qhorin
had
in
mind,
but
perhaps
it
was
a
chance.
He
hoped
so.
I
do
not
want
to
play
the
oathbreaker,
even
for
good
reason.

They
went
cautiously,
moving
as
silent
as
man
and
horse
could
move,
retracing
their
steps
until
they
reached
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
defile
where
an
icy
little
stream
emerged
from
between
two
mountains.
Jon
remembered
the
place.
They
had
watered
the
horses
here
before
the
sun
went
down.

“The
water’s
icing
up,”
Qhorin
observed
as
he
turned
aside,
“else
we’d
ride
in
the
streambed.
But
if
we
break
the
ice,
they
are
like
to
see.
Keep
close
to
the
cliffs.
There’s
a
crook
a
half
mile
on
that
will
hide
us.”
He
rode
into
the
defile.
Jon
gave
one
last
wistful
look
to
their
distant
fire,
and
followed.

The
farther
in
they
went,
the
closer
the
cliffs
pressed
to
either
side.
They
followed
the
moonlit
ribbon
of
stream
back
toward
its
source.
Icicles
bearded
its
stony
banks,
but
Jon
could
still
hear
the
sound
of
rushing
water
beneath
the
thin
hard
crust.

A
great
jumble
of
fallen
rock
blocked
their
way
partway
up,
where
a
section
of
the
cliff
face
had
fallen,
but
the
surefooted
little
garrons
were
able
to
pick
their
way
through.
Beyond,
the
walls
pinched
in
sharply,
and
the
stream
led
them
to
the
foot
of
a
tall
twisting
waterfall.
The
air
was
full
of
mist,
like
the
breath
of
some
vast
cold
beast.
The
tumbling
waters
shone
silver
in
the
moonlight.
Jon
looked
about
in
dismay.
There
is
no
way
out.
He
and
Qhorin
might
be
able
to
climb
the
cliffs,
but
not
with
the
horses.
He
did
not
think
they
would
last
long
afoot.

“Quickly
now,”
the
Halfhand
commanded.
The
big
man
on
the
small
horse
rode
over
the
ice-slick
stones,
right
into
the
curtain
of
water,
and
vanished.
When
he
did
not
reappear,
Jon
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
went
after.
His
garron
did
his
best
to
shy
away.
The
falling
water
slapped
at
them
with
frozen
fists,
and
the
shock
of
the
cold
seemed
to
stop
Jon’s
breath.

Then
he
was
through;
drenched
and
shivering,
but
through.

The
cleft
in
the
rock
was
barely
large
enough
for
man
and
horse
to
pass,
but
beyond,
the
walls
opened
up
and
the
floor
turned
to
soft
sand.
Jon
could
feel
the
spray
freezing
in
his
beard.
Ghost
burst
through
the
waterfall
in
an
angry
rush,
shook
droplets
from
his
fur,
sniffed
at
the
darkness
suspiciously,
then
lifted
a
leg
against
one
rocky
wall.
Qhorin
had
already
dismounted.
Jon
did
the
same.
“You
knew
this
place
was
here.”

“When
I
was
no
older
than
you,
I
heard
a
brother
tell
how
he
followed
a
shadowcat
through
these
falls.”
He
unsaddled
his
horse,
removed
her
bit
and
bridle,
and
ran
his
fingers
through
her
shaggy
mane.
“There
is
a
way
through
the
heart
of
the
mountain.
Come
dawn,
if
they
have
not
found
us,
we
will
press
on.
The
first
watch
is
mine,
brother.”
Qhorin
seated
himself
on
the
sand,
his
back
to
a
wall,
no
more
than
a
vague
black
shadow
in
the
gloom
of
the
cave.
Over
the
rush
of
falling
waters,
Jon
heard
a
soft
sound
of
steel
on
leather
that
could
only
mean
that
the
Halfhand
had
drawn
his
sword.

He
took
off
his
wet
cloak,
but
it
was
too
cold
and
damp
here
to
strip
down
any
further.
Ghost
stretched
out
beside
him
and
licked
his
glove
before
curling
up
to
sleep.
Jon
was
grateful
for
his
warmth.
He
wondered
if
the
fire
was
still
burning
outside,
or
if
it
had
gone
out
by
now.
If
the
Wall
should
ever
fall,
all
the
fires
will
go
out.
The
moon
shone
through
the
curtain
of
falling
water
to
lay
a
shimmering
pale
stripe
across
the
sand,
but
after
a
time
that
too
faded
and
went
dark.

Sleep
came
at
last,
and
with
it
nightmares.
He
dreamed
of
burning
castles
and
dead
men
rising
unquiet
from
their
graves.
It
was
still
dark
when
Qhorin
woke
him.
While
the
Halfhand
slept,
Jon
sat
with
his
back
to
the
cave
wall,
listening
to
the
water
and
waiting
for
the
dawn.

At
break
of
day,
they
each
chewed
a
half-frozen
strip
of
horsemeat,
then
saddled
their
garrons
once
again,
and
fastened
their
black
cloaks
around
their
shoulders.
During
his
watch
the
Halfhand
had
made
a
half-dozen
torches,
soaking
bundles
of
dry
moss
with
the
oil
he
carried
in
his
saddlebag.
He
lit
the
first
one
now
and
led
the
way
down
into
the
dark,
holding
the
pale
flame
up
before
him.
Jon
followed
with
the
horses.
The
stony
path
twisted
and
turned,
first
down,
then
up,
then
down
more
steeply.
In
spots
it
grew
so
narrow
it
was
hard
to
convince
the
garrons
they
could
squeeze
through.
By
the
time
we
come
out
we
will
have
lost
them,
he
told
himself
as
they
went.
Not
even
an
eagle
can
see
through
solid
stone.
We
will
have
lost
them,
and
we
will
ride
hard
for
the
Fist,
and
tell
the
Old
Bear
all
we
know.

But
when
they
emerged
back
into
the
light
long
hours
later,
the
eagle
was
waiting
for
them,
perched
on
a
dead
tree
a
hundred
feet
up
the
slope.
Ghost
went
bounding
up
the
rocks
after
it,
but
the
bird
flapped
its
wings
and
took
to
the
air.

Qhorin’s
mouth
tightened
as
he
followed
its
flight
with
his
eyes.

“Here
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
make
a
stand,”
he
declared.
“The
mouth
of
the
cave
shelters
us
from
above,
and
they
cannot
get
behind
us
without
passing
through
the
mountain.
Is
your
sword
sharp,
Jon
Snow?”

“Yes,”
he
said.

“We’ll
feed
the
horses.
They’ve
served
us
bravely,
poor
beasts.”

Jon
gave
his
garron
the
last
of
the
oats
and
stroked
his
shaggy
mane
while
Ghost
prowled
restlessly
amongst
the
rocks.
He
pulled
his
gloves
on
tighter
and
flexed
his
burnt
fingers.
I
am
=======
“They
have
my
son,”
Tywin
Lannister
said.

“They
do,
my
lord.”
The
messenger’s
voice
was
dulled
by
exhaustion.
On
the
breast
of
his
torn
surcoat,
the
brindled
boar
of
Crakehall
was
half-obscured
by
dried
blood.

One
of
your
sons,
Tyrion
thought.
He
took
a
sip
of
wine
and
said
not
a
word,
thinking
of
Jaime.
When
he
lifted
his
arm,
pain
shot
through
his
elbow,
reminding
him
of
his
own
brief
taste
of
battle.
He
loved
his
brother,
but
he
would
not
have
wanted
to
be
with
him
in
the
Whispering
Wood
for
all
the
gold
in
Casterly
Rock.

His
lord
father’s
assembled
captains
and
bannermen
had
fallen
very
quiet
as
the
courier
told
his
tale.
The
only
sound
was
the
crackle
and
hiss
of
the
log
burning
in
the
hearth
at
the
end
of
the
long,
drafty
common
room.

After
the
hardships
of
the
long
relentless
drive
south,
the
prospect
of
even
a
single
night
in
an
inn
had
cheered
Tyrion
mightily…
though
he
rather
wished
it
had
not
been
this
inn
again,
with
all
its
memories.
His
father
had
set
a
grueling
pace,
and
it
had
taken
its
toll.
Men
wounded
in
the
battle
kept
up
as
best
they
could
or
were
abandoned
to
fend
for
themselves.
Every
morning
they
left
a
few
more
by
the
roadside,
men
who
went
to
sleep
never
to
wake.
Every
afternoon
a
few
more
collapsed
along
the
way.
And
every
evening
a
few
more
deserted,
stealing
off
into
the
dusk.
Tyrion
had
been
half-tempted
to
go
with
them.

He
had
been
upstairs,
enjoying
the
comfort
of
a
featherbed
and
the
warmth
of
Shae’s
body
beside
him,
when
his
squire
had
woken
him
to
say
that
a
rider
had
arrived
with
dire
news
of
Riverrun.
So
it
had
all
been
for
nothing.
The
rush
south,
the
endless
forced
marches,
the
bodies
left
beside
the
road…
all
for
naught.
Robb
Stark
had
reached
Riverrun
days
and
days
ago.

“How
could
this
happen?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
moaned.
“How?
Even
after
the
Whispering
Wood,
you
had
Riverrun
ringed
in
iron,
surrounded
by
a
great
host…
what
madness
made
Ser
Jaime
decide
to
split
his
men
into
three
separate
camps?
Surely
he
knew
how
vulnerable
that
would
leave
them?”

Better
than
you,
you
chinless
craven,
Tyrion
thought.
Jaime
might
have
lost
Riverrun,
but
it
angered
him
to
hear
his
brother
slandered
by
the
likes
of
Swyft,
a
shameless
lickspittle
whose
greatest
accomplishment
was
marrying
his
equally
chinless
daughter
to
Ser
Kevan,
and
thereby
attaching
himself
to
the
Lannisters.

“I
would
have
done
the
same,”
his
uncle
responded,
a
good
deal
more
calmly
than
Tyrion
might
have.
“You
have
never
seen
Riverrun,
Ser
Harys,
or
you
would
know
that
Jaime
had
little
choice
in
the
matter.
The
castle
is
situated
at
the
end
of
the
point
of
land
where
the
Tumblestone
flows
into
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident.
The
rivers
form
two
sides
of
a
triangle,
and
when
danger
threatens,
the
Tullys
open
their
sluice
gates
upstream
to
create
a
wide
moat
on
the
third
side,
turning
Riverrun
into
an
island.
The
walls
rise
sheer
from
the
water,
and
from
their
towers
the
defenders
have
a
commanding
view
of
the
opposite
shores
for
many
leagues
around.
To
cut
off
all
the
approaches,
a
besieger
must
needs
place
one
camp
north
of
the
Tumblestone,
one
south
of
the
Red
Fork,
and
a
third
between
the
rivers,
west
of
the
moat.
There
is
no
other
way,
none.”

“Ser
Kevan
speaks
truly,
my
lords,”
the
courier
said.
“We’d
built
palisades
of
sharpened
stakes
around
the
camps,
yet
it
was
not
enough,
not
with
no
warning
and
the
rivers
cutting
us
off
from
each
other.
They
came
down
on
the
north
camp
first.
No
one
was
expecting
an
attack.
Marq
Piper
had
been
raiding
our
supply
trains,
but
he
had
no
more
than
fifty
men.
Ser
Jaime
had
gone
out
to
deal
with
them
the
night
before…
well,
with
what
we
thought
was
them.
We
were
told
the
Stark
host
was
east
of
the
Green
Fork,
marching
south…”

“And
your
outriders?”
Ser
Gregor
Clegane’s
face
might
have
been
hewn
from
rock.
The
fire
in
the
hearth
gave
a
somber
orange
cast
to
his
skin
and
put
deep
shadows
in
the
hollows
of
his
eyes.
“They
saw
nothing?
They
gave
you
no
warning?”

The
bloodstained
messenger
shook
his
head.
“Our
outriders
had
been
vanishing.
Marq
Piper’s
work,
we
thought.
The
ones
who
did
come
back
had
seen
nothing.”

“A
man
who
sees
nothing
has
no
use
for
his
eyes,”
the
Mountain
declared.
“Cut
them
out
and
give
them
to
your
next
outrider.
Tell
him
you
hope
that
four
eyes
might
see
better
than
two…
and
if
not,
the
man
after
him
will
have
six.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
turned
his
face
to
study
Ser
Gregor.
Tyrion
saw
a
glimmer
of
gold
as
the
light
shone
off
his
father’s
pupils,
but
he
could
not
have
said
whether
the
look
was
one
of
approval
or
disgust.
Lord
Tywin
was
oft
quiet
in
council,
preferring
to
listen
before
he
spoke,
a
habit
Tyrion
himself
tried
to
emulate.
Yet
this
silence
was
uncharacteristic
even
for
him,
and
his
wine
was
untouched.

“You
said
they
came
at
night,”
Ser
Kevan
prompted.

The
man
gave
a
weary
nod.
“The
Blackfish
led
the
van,
cutting
down
our
sentries
and
clearing
away
the
palisades
for
the
main
assault.
By
the
time
our
men
knew
what
was
happening,
riders
were
pouring
over
the
ditch
banks
and
galloping
through
the
camp
with
swords
and
torches
in
hand.
I
was
sleeping
in
the
west
camp,
between
the
rivers.
When
we
heard
the
fighting
and
saw
the
tents
being
fired,
Lord
Brax
led
us
to
the
rafts
and
we
tried
to
pole
across,
but
the
current
pushed
us
downstream
and
the
Tullys
started
flinging
rocks
at
us
with
the
catapults
on
their
walls.
I
saw
one
raft
smashed
to
kindling
and
three
others
overturned,
men
swept
into
the
river
and
drowned…
and
those
who
did
make
it
across
found
the
Starks
waiting
for
them
on
the
riverbanks.”

Ser
Flement
Brax
wore
a
silver-and-purple
tabard
and
the
look
of
a
man
who
cannot
comprehend
what
he
has
just
heard.
“My
lord
father—”

“Sorry,
my
lord,”
the
messenger
said.
“Lord
Brax
was
clad
in
plate-and-mail
when
his
raft
overturned.
He
was
very
gallant.”

He
was
a
fool,
Tyrion
thought,
swirling
his
cup
and
staring
down
into
the
winy
depths.
Crossing
a
river
at
night
on
a
crude
raft,
wearing
armor,
with
an
enemy
waiting
on
the
other
side—if
that
was
gallantry,
he
would
take
cowardice
every
time.
He
wondered
if
Lord
Brax
had
felt
especially
gallant
as
the
weight
of
his
steel
pulled
him
under
the
black
water.

“The
camp
between
the
rivers
was
overrun
as
well,”
the
messenger
was
saying.
“While
we
were
trying
to
cross,
more
Starks
swept
in
from
the
west,
two
columns
of
armored
horse.
I
saw
Lord
Umber’s
giant-in-chains
and
the
Mallister
eagle,
but
it
was
the
boy
who
led
them,
with
a
monstrous
wolf
running
at
his
side.
I
wasn’t
there
to
see,
but
it’s
said
the
beast
killed
four
men
and
ripped
apart
a
dozen
horses.
Our
spearmen
formed
up
a
shieldwall
and
held
against
their
first
charge,
but
when
the
Tullys
saw
them
engaged,
they
opened
the
gates
of
Riverrun
and
Tytos
Blackwood
led
a
sortie
across
the
drawbridge
and
took
them
in
the
rear.”

“Gods
save
us,”
Lord
Lefford
swore.

“Greatjon
Umber
fired
the
siege
towers
we
were
building,
and
Lord
Blackwood
found
Ser
Edmure
Tully
in
chains
among
the
other
captives,
and
made
off
with
them
all.
Our
south
camp
was
under
the
command
of
Ser
Forley
Prester.
He
retreated
in
good
order
when
he
saw
that
the
other
camps
were
lost,
with
two
thousand
spears
and
as
many
bowmen,
but
the
Tyroshi
sellsword
who
led
his
freeriders
struck
his
banners
and
went
over
to
the
foe.”

“Curse
the
man.”
His
uncle
Kevan
sounded
more
angry
than
surprised.
“I
warned
Jaime
not
to
trust
that
one.
A
man
who
fights
for
coin
is
loyal
only
to
his
purse.”

Lord
Tywin
wove
his
fingers
together
under
his
chin.
Only
his
eyes
moved
as
he
listened.
His
bristling
golden
side-whiskers
framed
a
face
so
still
it
might
have
been
a
mask,
but
Tyrion
could
see
tiny
beads
of
sweat
dappling
his
father’s
shaven
head.

“How
could
it
happen?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
wailed
again.
“Ser
Jaime
taken,
the
siege
broken…
this
is
a
catastrophe!”

Ser
Addam
Marbrand
said,
“I
am
sure
we
are
all
grateful
to
you
for
pointing
out
the
obvious,
Ser
Harys.
The
question
is,
what
shall
we
do
about
it?”

“What
can
we
do?
Jaime’s
host
is
all
slaughtered
or
taken
or
put
to
flight,
and
the
Starks
and
the
Tullys
sit
squarely
across
our
line
of
supply.
We
are
cut
off
from
the
west!
They
can
march
on
Casterly
Rock
if
they
so
choose,
and
what’s
to
stop
them?
My
lords,
we
are
beaten.
We
must
sue
for
peace.”

“Peace?”
Tyrion
swirled
his
wine
thoughtfully,
took
a
deep
draft,
and
hurled
his
empty
cup
to
the
floor,
where
it
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces.
“There’s
your
peace,
Ser
Harys.
My
sweet
nephew
broke
it
for
good
and
all
when
he
decided
to
ornament
the
Red
Keep
with
Lord
Eddard’s
head.
You’ll
have
an
easier
time
drinking
wine
from
that
cup
than
you
will
convincing
Robb
Stark
to
make
peace
now.
He’s
winning…
or
hadn’t
you
noticed?”

“Two
battles
do
not
make
a
war,”
Ser
Addam
insisted.
“We
are
far
from
lost.
I
should
welcome
the
chance
to
try
my
own
steel
against
this
Stark
boy.”

“Perhaps
they
would
consent
to
a
truce,
and
allow
us
to
trade
our
prisoners
for
theirs,”
offered
Lord
Lefford.

“Unless
they
trade
three-for-one,
we
still
come
out
light
on
those
scales,”
Tyrion
said
acidly.
“And
what
are
we
to
offer
for
my
brother?
Lord
Eddard’s
rotting
head?”

“I
had
heard
that
Queen
Cersei
has
the
Hand’s
daughters,”
Lefford
said
hopefully.
“If
we
give
the
lad
his
sisters
back…”

Ser
Addam
snorted
disdainfully.
“He
would
have
to
be
an
utter
ass
to
trade
Jaime
Lannister’s
life
for
two
girls.”

“Then
we
must
ransom
Ser
Jaime,
whatever
it
costs,”
Lord
Lefford
said.

Tyrion
rolled
his
eyes.
“If
the
Starks
feel
the
need
for
gold,
they
can
melt
down
Jaime’s
armor.”

“if
we
ask
for
a
truce,
they
will
think
us
weak,”
Ser
Addarn
argued.
“We
should
march
on
them
at
once.”

“Surely
our
friends
at
court
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
join
us
with
fresh
troops,”
said
Ser
Harys.
“And
someone
might
return
to
Casterly
Rock
to
raise
a
new
host.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
rose
to
his
feet.
“They
have
my
son,”
he
said
once
more,
in
a
voice
that
cut
through
the
babble
like
a
sword
through
suet.
“Leave
me.
All
of
you.”

Ever
the
soul
of
obedience,
Tyrion
rose
to
depart
with
the
rest,
but
his
father
gave
him
a
look.
“Not
you,
Tyrion.
Remain.
And
you
as
well,
Kevan.
The
rest
of
you,
out.”

Tyrion
eased
himself
back
onto
the
bench,
startled
into
speechlessness.
Ser
Kevan
crossed
the
room
to
the
wine
casks.
“Uncle,”
Tyrion
called,
“if
you
would
be
so
kind—”

“Here.”
His
father
offered
him
his
cup,
the
wine
untouched.

Now
Tyrion
truly
was
nonplussed.
He
drank.

Lord
Tywin
seated
himself.
“You
have
the
right
of
it
about
Stark.
Alive,
we
might
have
used
Lord
Eddard
to
forge
a
peace
with
Winterfell
and
Riverrun,
a
peace
that
would
have
given
us
the
time
we
need
to
deal
with
Robert’s
brothers.
Dead…”
His
hand
curled
into
a
fist.
“Madness.
Rank
madness.”

“Joff’s
only
a
boy,”
Tyrion
pointed
out.
“At
his
age,
I
committed
a
few
follies
of
my
own.”

His
father
gave
him
a
sharp
look.
“I
suppose
we
ought
to
be
grateful
that
he
has
not
yet
married
a
whore.”

Tyrion
sipped
at
his
wine,
wondering
how
Lord
Tywin
would
look
if
he
flung
the
cup
in
his
face.

“Our
position
is
worse
than
you
know,”
his
father
went
on.
“It
would
seem
we
have
a
new
king.”

Ser
Kevan
looked
poleaxed.
“A
new—who?
What
have
they
done
to
Joffrey?”

The
faintest
flicker
of
distaste
played
across
Lord
Tywin’s
thin
lips.
“Nothing…
yet.
My
grandson
still
sits
the
Iron
Throne,
but
the
eunuch
has
heard
whispers
from
the
south.
Renly
Baratheon
wed
Margaery
Tyrell
at
Highgarden
this
fortnight
past,
and
now
he
has
claimed
the
crown.
The
bride’s
father
and
brothers
have
bent
the
knee
and
sworn
him
their
swords.”

“Those
are
grave
tidings.”
When
Ser
Kevan
frowned,
the
furrows
in
his
brow
grew
deep
as
canyons.

“My
daughter
commands
us
to
ride
for
King’s
Landing
at
once,
to
defend
the
Red
Keep
against
King
Renly
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers.”
His
mouth
tightened.
“Commands
us,
mind
you.
In
the
name
of
the
king
and
council.”

“How
is
King
Joffrey
taking
the
news?”
Tyrion
asked
with
a
certain
black
amusement.

“Cersei
has
not
seen
fit
to
tell
him
yet,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“She
fears
he
might
insist
on
marching
against
Renly
himself.”

“With
what
army?”
Tyrion
asked.
“You
don’t
plan
to
give
him
this
one,
I
hope?”

“He
talks
of
leading
the
City
Watch,”
Lord
Tywin
said.

“If
he
takes
the
Watch,
he’ll
leave
the
city
undefended,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“And
with
Lord
Stannis
on
Dragonstone…”

“Yes.”
Lord
Tywin
looked
down
at
his
son.
“I
had
thought
you
were
the
one
made
for
motley,
Tyrion,
but
it
would
appear
that
I
was
wrong.”

“Why,
Father,”
said
Tyrion,
“that
almost
sounds
like
praise.”
He
leaned
forward
intently.
“What
of
Stannis?
He’s
the
elder,
not
Renly.
How
does
he
feel
about
his
brother’s
claim?”

His
father
frowned.
“I
have
felt
from
the
beginning
that
Stannis
was
a
greater
danger
than
all
the
others
combined.
Yet
he
does
nothing.
Oh,
Varys
hears
his
whispers.
Stannis
is
building
ships,
Stannis
is
hiring
sellswords,
Stannis
is
bringing
a
shadowbinder
from
Asshai.
What
does
it
mean?
Is
any
of
it
true?”
He
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
“Kevan,
bring
us
the
map.”

Ser
Kevan
did
as
he
was
bid.
Lord
Tywin
unrolled
the
leather,
smoothing
it
flat.
“Jaime
has
left
us
in
a
bad
way.
Roose
Bolton
and
the
remnants
of
his
host
are
north
of
us.
Our
enemies
hold
the
Twins
and
Moat
Cailin.
Robb
Stark
sits
to
the
west,
so
we
cannot
retreat
to
Lannisport
and
the
Rock
unless
we
choose
to
give
battle.
Jaime
is
taken,
and
his
army
for
all
purposes
has
ceased
to
exist.
Thoros
of
Myr
and
Beric
Dondarrion
continue
to
plague
our
foraging
parties.
To
our
east
we
have
the
Arryns,
Stannis
Baratheon
sits
on
Dragonstone,
and
in
the
south
Highgarden
and
Storm’s
End
are
calling
their
banners.”

Tyrion
smiled
crookedly.
“Take
heart,
Father.
At
least
Rhaegar
Targaryen
is
still
dead.”

“I
had
hoped
you
might
have
more
to
offer
us
than
japes,
Tyrion,”
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
said.

Ser
Kevan
frowned
over
the
map,
forehead
creasing.
“Robb
Stark
will
have
Edmure
Tully
and
the
lords
of
the
Trident
with
him
now.
Their
combined
power
may
exceed
our
own.
And
with
Roose
Bolton
behind
us…
Tywin,
if
we
remain
here,
I
fear
we
might
be
caught
between
three
armies.”

“I
have
no
intention
of
remaining
here.
We
must
finish
our
business
with
young
Lord
Stark
before
Renly
Baratheon
can
march
from
Highgarden.
Bolton
does
not
concern
me.
He
is
a
wary
man,
and
we
made
him
warier
on
the
Green
Fork.
He
will
be
slow
to
give
pursuit.
So…
on
the
morrow,
we
make
for
Harrenhal.
Kevan,
I
want
Ser
Addam’s
outriders
to
screen
our
movements.
Give
him
as
many
men
as
he
requires,
and
send
them
out
in
groups
of
four.
I
will
have
no
vanishings.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord,
but…
why
Harrenhal?
That
is
a
grim,
unlucky
place.
Some
call
it
cursed.”

“Let
them,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“Unleash
Ser
Gregor
and
send
him
before
us
with
his
reavers.
Send
forth
Vargo
Hoat
and
his
freeriders
as
well,
and
Ser
Amory
Lorch.
Each
is
to
have
three
hundred
horse.
Tell
them
I
want
to
see
the
riverlands
afire
from
the
Gods
Eye
to
the
Red
Fork.”

“They
will
burn,
my
lord,”
Ser
Kevan
said,
rising.
“I
shall
give
the
commands.”
He
bowed
and
made
for
the
door.

When
they
were
alone,
Lord
Tywin
glanced
at
Tyrion.
“Your
savages
might
relish
a
bit
of
rapine.
Tell
them
they
may
ride
with
Vargo
Hoat
and
plunder
as
they
like—goods,
stock,
women,
they
may
take
what
they
want
and
burn
the
rest.”

“Telling
Shagga
and
Timett
how
to
pillage
is
like
telling
a
rooster
how
to
crow,”
Tyrion
commented,
“but
I
should
prefer
to
keep
them
with
me.”
Uncouth
and
unruly
they
might
be,
yet
the
wildlings
were
his,
and
he
trusted
them
more
than
any
of
his
father’s
men.
He
was
not
about
to
hand
them
over.

“Then
you
had
best
learn
to
control
them.
I
will
not
have
the
city
plundered.”

“The
city?”
Tyrion
was
lost.
“What
city
would
that
be?”

“King’s
Landing.
I
am
sending
you
to
court.”

It
was
the
last
thing
Tyrion
Lannister
would
ever
have
anticipated.

He
reached
for
his
wine,
and
considered
for
a
moment
as
he
sipped.
“And
what
am
I
to
do
there?”

“Rule,”
his
father
said
curtly.

Tyrion
hooted
with
laughter.
“My
sweet
sister
might
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
that!”

“Let
her
say
what
she
likes.
Her
son
needs
to
be
taken
in
hand
before
he
ruins
us
all.
I
blame
those
jackanapes
on
the
council—our
friend
Petyr,
the
venerable
Grand
Maester,
and
that
cockless
wonder
Lord
Varys.
What
sort
of
counsel
are
they
giving
Joffrey
when
he
lurches
from
one
folly
to
the
next?
Whose
notion
was
it
to
make
this
Janos
Slynt
a
lord?
The
man’s
father
was
a
butcher,
and
they
grant
him
Harrenhal.
Harrenhal,
that
was
the
seat
of
kings!
Not
that
he
will
ever
set
foot
inside
it,
if
I
have
a
say.
I
am
told
he
took
a
bloody
spear
for
his
sigil.
A
bloody
cleaver
would
have
been
my
choice.”
His
father
had
not
raised
his
voice,
yet
Tyrion
could
see
the
anger
in
the
gold
of
his
eyes.
“And
dismissing
Selmy,
where
was
the
sense
in
that?
Yes,
the
man
was
old,
but
the
name
of
Barristan
the
Bold
still
has
meaning
in
the
realm.
He
lent
honor
to
any
man
he
served.
Can
anyone
say
the
same
of
the
Hound?
You
feed
your
dog
bones
under
the
table,
you
do
not
seat
him
beside
you
on
the
high
bench.”
He
pointed
a
finger
at
Tyrion’s
face.
“If
Cersei
cannot
curb
the
boy,
you
must.
And
if
these
councillors
are
playing
us
false…”

Tyrion
knew.
“Spikes,”
he
sighed.
“Heads.
Walls.”

“I
see
you
have
taken
a
few
lessons
from
me.”

“More
than
you
know,
Father,”
Tyrion
answered
quietly.
He
finished
his
wine
and
set
the
cup
aside,
thoughtful.
A
part
of
him
was
more
pleased
than
he
cared
to
admit.
Another
part
was
remembering
the
battle
upriver,
and
wondering
if
he
was
being
sent
to
hold
the
left
again.
“Why
me?”
he
asked,
cocking
his
head
to
one
side.
“Why
not
my
uncle?
Why
not
Ser
Addam
or
Ser
Flement
or
Lord
Serrett?
Why
not
a…
bigger
man?”

Lord
Tywin
rose
abruptly.
“You
are
my
son.”

That
was
when
he
knew.
You
have
given
him
up
for
lost,
he
thought.
You
bloody
bastard,
you
think
Jaime’s
good
as
dead,
so
I’m
all
you
have
left.
Tyrion
wanted
to
slap
him,
to
spit
in
his
face,
to
draw
his
dagger
and
cut
the
heart
out
of
him
and
see
if
it
was
made
of
old
hard
gold,
the
way
the
smallfolks
said.
Yet
he
sat
there,
silent
and
still.

The
shards
of
the
broken
cup
crunched
beneath
his
father’s
heels
as
Lord
Tywin
crossed
the
room.
“One
last
thing,”
he
said
at
the
door.
“You
will
not
take
the
whore
to
court.”

Tyrion
sat
alone
in
the
common
room
for
a
long
while
after
his
father
was
gone.
Finally
he
climbed
the
steps
to
his
cozy
garret
beneath
the
bell
tower.
The
ceiling
was
low,
but
that
was
scarcely
a
drawback
for
a
dwarf.
From
the
window,
he
could
see
the
gibbet
his
father
had
erected
in
the
yard.
The
innkeep’s
body
turned
slowly
on
its
rope
whenever
the
night
wind
gusted.
Her
flesh
had
grown
as
thin
and
ragged
as
Lannister
hopes.

Shae
murmured
sleepily
and
rolled
toward
him
when
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
featherbed.
He
slid
his
hand
under
the
blanket
and
cupped
a
soft
breast,
and
her
eyes
opened.
“M’lord,”
she
said
with
a
drowsy
smile.

When
he
felt
her
nipple
stiffen,
Tyrion
kissed
her.
“I
have
a
mind
to
take
you
to
King’s
Landing,
sweetling,”
he
whispered.





JON

The
mare
whickered
softly
as
Jon
Snow
tightened
the
cinch.
“Easy,
sweet
lady,”
he
said
in
a
soft
voice,
quieting
her
with
a
touch.
Wind
whispered
through
the
stable,
a
cold
dead
breath
on
his
face,
but
Jon
paid
it
no
mind.
He
strapped
his
roll
to
the
saddle,
his
scarred
fingers
stiff
and
clumsy.
“Ghost,”
he
called
softly,
“to
me.”
And
the
wolf
was
there,
eyes
like
embers.

“Jon,
please.
You
must
not
do
this.”

He
mounted,
the
reins
in
his
hand,
and
wheeled
the
horse
around
to
face
the
night.
Samwell
Tarly
stood
in
the
stable
door,
a
full
moon
peering
over
his
shoulder.
He
threw
a
giant’s
shadow,
immense
and
black.
“Get
out
of
my
way,
Sam.”

“Jon,
you
can’t,”
Sam
said.
“I
won’t
let
you.”

“I
would
sooner
not
hurt
you,”
Jon
told
him.
“Move
aside,
Sam,
or
I’ll
ride
you
down.”

“You
won’t.
You
have
to
listen
to
me.
Please…”

Jon
put
his
spurs
to
horseflesh,
and
the
mare
bolted
for
the
door.
For
an
instant
Sam
stood
his
ground,
his
face
as
round
and
pale
as
the
moon
behind
him,
his
mouth
a
widening
O
of
surprise.
At
the
last
moment,
when
they
were
almost
on
him,
he
jumped
aside
as
Jon
had
known
he
would,
stumbled,
and
fell.
The
mare
leapt
over
him,
out
into
the
night.

Jon
raised
the
hood
of
his
heavy
cloak
and
gave
the
horse
her
head.
Castle
Black
was
silent
and
still
as
he
rode
out,
with
Ghost
racing
at
his
side.
Men
watched
from
the
Wall
behind
him,
he
knew,
but
their
eyes
were
turned
north,
not
south.
No
one
would
see
him
go,
no
one
but
Sam
Tarly,
struggling
back
to
his
feet
in
the
dust
of
the
old
stables.
He
hoped
Sam
hadn’t
hurt
himself,
falling
like
that.
He
was
so
heavy
and
so
ungainly,
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
break
a
wrist
or
twist
his
ankle
getting
out
of
the
way.
“I
warned
him,”
Jon
said
aloud.
“It
was
nothing
to
do
with
him,
anyway.”
He
flexed
his
burned
hand
as
he
rode,
opening
and
closing
the
scarred
fingers.
They
still
pained
him,
but
it
felt
good
to
have
the
wrappings
off.

Moonlight
silvered
the
hills
as
he
followed
the
twisting
ribbon
of
the
kingsroad.
He
needed
to
get
as
far
from
the
Wall
as
he
could
before
they
realized
he
was
gone.
On
the
morrow
he
would
leave
the
road
and
strike
out
overland
through
field
and
bush
and
stream
to
throw
off
pursuit,
but
for
the
moment
speed
was
more
important
than
deception.
It
was
not
as
though
they
would
not
guess
where
he
was
going.

The
Old
Bear
was
accustomed
to
rise
at
first
light,
so
Jon
had
until
dawn
to
put
as
many
leagues
as
he
could
between
him
and
the
Wall…
if
Sam
Tarly
did
not
betray
him.
The
fat
boy
was
dutiful
and
easily
frightened,
but
he
loved
Jon
like
a
brother.
If
questioned,
Sam
would
doubtless
tell
them
the
truth,
but
Jon
could
not
imagine
him
braving
the
guards
in
front
of
the
King’s
Tower
to
wake
Mormont
from
sleep.

When
Jon
did
not
appear
to
fetch
the
Old
Bear’s
breakfast
from
the
kitchen,
they’d
look
in
his
cell
and
find
Longclaw
on
the
bed.
It
had
been
hard
to
abandon
it,
but
Jon
was
not
so
lost
to
honor
as
to
take
it
with
him.
Even
Jorah
Mormont
had
not
done
that,
when
he
fled
in
disgrace.
Doubtless
Lord
Mormont
would
find
someone
more
worthy
of
the
blade.
Jon
felt
bad
when
he
thought
of
the
old
man.
He
knew
his
desertion
would
be
salt
in
the
still-raw
wound
of
his
son’s
disgrace.
That
seemed
a
poor
way
to
repay
him
for
his
trust,
but
it
couldn’t
be
helped.
No
matter
what
he
did,
Jon
felt
as
though
he
were
betraying
someone.

Even
now,
he
did
not
know
if
he
was
doing
the
honorable
thing.
The
southron
had
it
easier.
They
had
their
septons
to
talk
to,
someone
to
tell
them
the
gods’
will
and
help
sort
out
right
from
wrong.
But
the
Starks
worshiped
the
old
gods,
the
nameless
gods,
and
if
the
heart
trees
heard,
they
did
not
speak.

When
the
last
lights
of
Castle
Black
vanished
behind
him,
Jon
slowed
his
mare
to
a
walk.
He
had
a
long
journey
ahead
and
only
the
one
horse
to
see
him
through.
There
were
holdfasts
and
farming
villages
along
the
road
south
where
he
might
be
able
to
trade
the
mare
for
a
fresh
mount
when
he
needed
one,
but
not
if
she
were
injured
or
blown.

He
would
need
to
find
new
clothes
soon;
most
like,
he’d
need
to
steal
them.
He
was
clad
in
black
from
head
to
heel;
high
leather
riding
boots,
roughspun
breeches
and
tunic,
sleeveless
leather
jerkin,
and
heavy
wool
cloak.
His
longsword
and
dagger
were
sheathed
in
black
moleskin,
and
the
hauberk
and
coif
in
his
saddlebag
were
black
ringmail.
Any
bit
of
it
could
mean
his
death
if
he
were
taken.
A
stranger
wearing
black
was
viewed
with
cold
suspicion
in
every
village
and
holdfast
north
of
the
Neck,
and
men
would
soon
be
watching
for
him.
Once
Maester
Aemon’s
ravens
took
flight,
Jon
knew
he
would
find
no
safe
haven.
Not
even
at
Winterfell.
Bran
might
want
to
let
him
in,
but
Maester
Luwin
had
better
sense.
He
would
bar
the
gates
and
send
Jon
away,
as
he
should.
Better
not
to
call
there
at
all.

Yet
he
saw
the
castle
clear
in
his
mind’s
eye,
as
if
he
had
left
it
only
yesterday;
the
towering
granite
walls,
the
Great
Hall
with
its
smells
of
smoke
and
dog
and
roasting
meat,
his
father’s
solar,
the
turret
room
where
he
had
slept.
Part
of
him
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
hear
Bran
laugh
again,
to
sup
on
one
of
Gage’s
beef-and-bacon
pies,
to
listen
to
Old
Nan
tell
her
tales
of
the
children
of
the
forest
and
Florian
the
Fool.

But
he
had
not
left
the
Wall
for
that;
he
had
left
because
he
was
after
all
his
father’s
son,
and
Robb’s
brother.
The
gift
of
a
sword,
even
a
sword
as
fine
as
Longclaw,
did
not
make
him
a
Mormont.
Nor
was
he
Aemon
Targaryen.
Three
times
the
old
man
had
chosen,
and
three
times
he
had
chosen
honor,
but
that
was
him.
Even
now,
Jon
could
not
decide
whether
the
maester
had
stayed
because
he
was
weak
and
craven,
or
because
he
was
strong
and
true.
Yet
he
understood
what
the
old
man
had
meant,
about
the
pain
of
choosing;
he
understood
that
all
too
well.

Tyrion
Lannister
had
claimed
that
most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it,
but
Jon
was
done
with
denials.
He
was
who
he
was;
Jon
Snow,
bastard
and
oathbreaker,
motherless,
friendless,
and
damned.
For
the
rest
of
his
life—however
long
that
might
be—he
would
be
condemned
to
be
an
outsider,
the
silent
man
standing
in
the
shadows
who
dares
not
speak
his
true
name.
Wherever
he
might
go
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
he
would
need
to
live
a
lie,
lest
every
man’s
hand
be
raised
against
him.
But
it
made
no
matter,
so
long
as
he
lived
long
enough
to
take
his
place
by
his
brother’s
side
and
help
avenge
his
father.

He
remembered
Robb
as
he
had
last
seen
him,
standing
in
the
yard
with
snow
melting
in
his
auburn
hair.
Jon
would
have
to
come
to
him
in
secret,
disguised.
He
tried
to
imagine
the
look
on
Robb’s
face
when
he
revealed
himself.
His
brother
would
shake
his
head
and
smile,
and
he’d
say…
he’d
say…

He
could
not
see
the
smile.
Hard
as
he
tried,
he
could
not
see
it.
He
found
himself
thinking
of
the
deserter
his
father
had
beheaded
the
day
they’d
found
the
direwolves.
“You
said
the
words,”
Lord
Eddard
had
told
him.
“You
took
a
vow,
before
your
brothers,
before
the
old
gods
and
the
new.”
Desmond
and
Fat
Tom
had
dragged
the
man
to
the
stump.
Bran’s
eyes
had
been
wide
as
saucers,
and
Jon
had
to
remind
him
to
keep
his
pony
in
hand.
He
remembered
the
look
on
Father’s
face
when
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
forth
Ice,
the
spray
of
blood
on
the
snow,
the
way
Theon
had
kicked
the
head
when
it
came
rolling
at
his
feet.

He
wondered
what
Lord
Eddard
might
have
done
if
the
deserter
had
been
his
brother
Benjen
instead
of
that
ragged
stranger.
Would
it
have
been
any
different?
It
must,
surely,
surely…
and
Robb
would
welcome
him,
for
a
certainty.
He
had
to,
or
else…

It
did
not
bear
thinking
about.
Pain
throbbed,
deep
in
his
fingers,
as
he
clutched
the
reins.
Jon
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
broke
into
a
gallop,
racing
down
the
kingsroad,
as
if
to
outrun
his
doubts.
Jon
was
not
afraid
of
death,
but
he
did
not
want
to
die
like
that,
trussed
and
bound
and
beheaded
like
a
common
brigand.
If
he
must
perish,
let
it
be
with
a
sword
in
his
hand,
fighting
his
father’s
killers.
He
was
no
true
Stark,
had
never
been
one…
but
he
could
die
like
one.
Let
them
say
that
Eddard
Stark
had
fathered
four
sons,
not
three.

Ghost
kept
pace
with
them
for
almost
half
a
mile,
red
tongue
lolling
from
his
mouth.
Man
and
horse
alike
lowered
their
heads
as
he
asked
the
mare
for
more
speed.
The
wolf
slowed,
stopped,
watching,
his
eyes
glowing
red
in
the
moonlight.
He
vanished
behind,
but
Jon
knew
he
would
follow,
at
his
own
pace.

Scattered
lights
flickered
through
the
trees
ahead
of
him,
on
both
sides
of
the
road:
Mole’s
Town.
A
dog
barked
as
he
rode
through,
and
he
heard
a
mule’s
raucous
haw
from
the
stable,
but
otherwise
the
village
was
still.
Here
and
there
the
glow
of
hearth
fires
shone
through
shuttered
windows,
leaking
between
wooden
slats,
but
only
a
few.

Mole’s
Town
was
bigger
than
it
seemed,
but
three
quarters
of
it
was
under
the
ground,
in
deep
warm
cellars
connected
by
a
maze
of
tunnels.
Even
the
whorehouse
was
down
there,
nothing
on
the
surface
but
a
wooden
shack
no
bigger
than
a
privy,
with
a
red
lantern
hung
over
the
door.
On
the
Wall,
he’d
heard
men
call
the
whores
“buried
treasures.”
He
wondered
whether
any
of
his
brothers
in
black
were
down
there
tonight,
mining.
That
was
oathbreaking
too,
yet
no
one
seemed
to
care.

Not
until
he
was
well
beyond
the
village
did
Jon
slow
again.
By
then
both
he
and
the
mare
were
damp
with
sweat.
He
dismounted,
shivering,
his
burned
hand
aching.
A
bank
of
melting
snow
lay
under
the
trees,
bright
in
the
moonlight,
water
trickling
off
to
form
small
shallow
pools.
Jon
squatted
and
brought
his
hands
together,
cupping
the
runoff
between
his
fingers.
The
snowmelt
was
icy
cold.
He
drank,
and
splashed
some
on
his
face,
until
his
cheeks
tingled.
His
fingers
were
throbbing
worse
than
they
had
in
days,
and
his
head
was
pounding
too.
I
am
doing
the
right
thing,
he
told
himself,
so
why
do
I
feel
so
bad?

The
horse
was
well
lathered,
so
Jon
took
the
lead
and
walked
her
for
a
while.
The
road
was
scarcely
wide
enough
for
two
riders
to
pass
abreast,
its
surface
cut
by
tiny
streams
and
littered
with
stone.
That
run
had
been
truly
stupid,
an
invitation
to
a
broken
neck.
Jon
wondered
what
had
gotten
into
him.
Was
he
in
such
a
great
rush
to
die?

Off
in
the
trees,
the
distant
scream
of
some
frightened
animal
made
him
look
up.
His
mare
whinnied
nervously.
Had
his
wolf
found
some
prey?
He
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth.
“Ghost!”
he
shouted.
“Ghost,
to
me.”
The
only
answer
was
a
rush
of
wings
behind
him
as
an
owl
took
flight.

Frowning,
Jon
continued
on
his
way.
He
led
the
mare
for
half
an
hour,
until
she
was
dry.
Ghost
did
not
appear.
Jon
wanted
to
mount
up
and
ride
again,
but
he
was
concerned
about
his
missing
wolf.
“Ghost,”
he
called
again.
“Where
are
you?
To
me!
Ghost!”
Nothing
in
these
woods
could
trouble
a
direwolf,
even
a
half-grown
direwolf,
unless…
no,
Ghost
was
too
smart
to
attack
a
bear,
and
if
there
was
a
wolf
pack
anywhere
close
Jon
would
have
surely
heard
them
howling.

He
should
eat,
he
decided.
Food
would
settle
his
stomach
and
give
Ghost
the
chance
to
catch
up.
There
was
no
danger
yet;
Castle
Black
still
slept.
In
his
saddlebag,
he
found
a
biscuit,
a
piece
of
cheese,
and
a
small
withered
brown
apple.
He’d
brought
salt
beef
as
well,
and
a
rasher
of
bacon
he’d
filched
from
the
kitchens,
but
he
would
save
the
meat
for
the
morrow.
After
it
was
gone
he’d
need
to
hunt,
and
that
would
slow
him.

Jon
sat
under
the
trees
and
ate
his
biscuit
and
cheese
while
his
mare
grazed
along
the
kingsroad.
He
kept
the
apple
for
last.
It
had
gone
a
little
soft,
but
the
flesh
was
still
tart
and
juicy.
He
was
down
to
the
core
when
he
heard
the
sounds:
horses,
and
from
the
north.
Quickly
Jon
leapt
up
and
strode
to
his
mare.
Could
he
outrun
them?
No,
they
were
too
close,
they’d
hear
him
for
a
certainty,
and
if
they
were
from
Castle
Black…

He
led
the
mare
off
the
road,
behind
a
thick
stand
of
grey-green
sentinels.
“Ouiet
now,”
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice,
crouching
down
to
peer
through
the
branches.
If
the
gods
were
kind,
the
riders
would
pass
by.
Likely
as
not,
they
were
only
smallfolk
from
Mole’s
Town,
farmers
on
their
way
to
their
fields,
although
what
they
were
doing
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night…

He
listened
to
the
sound
of
hooves
growing
steadily
louder
as
they
trotted
briskly
down
the
kingsroad.
From
the
sound,
there
were
five
or
six
of
them
at
the
least.
Their
voices
drifted
through
the
trees.

“…certain
he
came
this
way?”

“We
can’t
be
certain.”

“He
could
have
ridden
east,
for
all
you
know.
Or
left
the
road
to
cut
through
the
woods.
That’s
what
I’d
do.”

“In
the
dark?
Stupid.
If
you
didn’t
fall
off
your
horse
and
break
your
neck,
you’d
get
lost
and
wind
up
back
at
the
Wall
when
the
sun
came
up.”

“I
would
not.”
Grenn
sounded
peeved.
“I’d
just
ride
south,
you
can
tell
south
by
the
stars.”

“What
if
the
sky
was
cloudy?”
Pyp
asked.

“Then
I
wouldn’t
go.”

Another
voice
broke
in.
“You
know
where
I’d
be
if
it
was
me?
I’d
be
in
Mole’s
Town,
digging
for
buried
treasure.”
Toad’s
shrill
laughter
boomed
through
the
trees.
Jon’s
mare
snorted.

“Keep
quiet,
all
of
you,”
Haider
said.
“I
thought
I
heard
something.”

“Where?
I
didn’t
hear
anything.”
The
horses
stopped.

“You
can’t
hear
yourself
fart.”

“I
can
too,”
Grenn
insisted.

“Quiet!”

They
all
fell
silent,
listening.
Jon
found
himself
holding
his
breath.
Sam,
he
thought.
He
hadn’t
gone
to
the
Old
Bear,
but
he
hadn’t
gone
to
bed
either,
he’d
woken
the
other
boys.
Damn
them
all.
Come
dawn,
if
they
were
not
in
their
beds,
they’d
be
named
deserters
too.
What
did
they
think
they
were
doing?

The
hushed
silence
seemed
to
stretch
on
and
on.
From
where
Jon
crouched,
he
could
see
the
legs
of
their
horses
through
the
branches.
Finally
Pyp
spoke
up.
“What
did
you
hear?”

“I
don’t
know,”
Haider
admitted.
“A
sound,
I
thought
it
might
have
been
a
horse
but…”

“There’s
nothing
here.”

Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
Jon
glimpsed
a
pale
shape
moving
through
the
trees.
Leaves
rustled,
and
Ghost
came
bounding
out
of
the
shadows,
so
suddenly
that
Jon’s
mare
started
and
gave
a
whinny.
“There!”
Halder
shouted.

“I
heard
it
too!”

“Traitor,”
Jon
told
the
direwolf
as
he
swung
up
into
the
saddle.
He
turned
the
mare’s
head
to
slide
off
through
the
trees,
but
they
were
on
him
before
he
had
gone
ten
feet.

“Jon!”
Pyp
shouted
after
him.

“Pull
up,”
Grenn
said.
“You
can’t
outrun
us
all.”

Jon
wheeled
around
to
face
them,
drawing
his
sword.
“Get
back.
I
don’t
wish
to
hurt
you,
but
I
will
if
I
have
to.”

“One
against
seven?”
Halder
gave
a
signal.
The
boys
spread
out,
surrounding
him.

“What
do
you
want
with
me?”
Jon
demanded.

“We
want
to
take
you
back
where
you
belong,”
Pyp
said.

“I
belong
with
my
brother.”

“We’re
your
brothers
now,”
Grenn
said.

“They’ll
cut
off
your
head
if
they
catch
you,
you
know,”
Toad
put
in
with
a
nervous
laugh.
“This
is
so
stupid,
it’s
like
something
the
Aurochs
would
do.”

“I
would
not,”
Grenn
said.
“I’m
no
oathbreaker.
I
said
the
words
and
I
meant
them.”

“So
did
I,”
Jon
told
them.
“Don’t
you
understand?
They
murdered
my
father.
It’s
war,
my
brother
Robb
is
fighting
in
the
riverlands—”

“We
know,”
said
Pyp
solemnly.
“Sam
told
us
everything.”

“We’re
sorry
about
your
father,”
Grenn
said,
“but
it
doesn’t
matter.
Once
you
say
the
words,
you
can’t
leave,
no
matter
what.”

“I
have
to,”
Jon
said
fervently.

“You
said
the
words,”
Pyp
reminded
him.
“Now
my
watch
begins,
you
said
it.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.”

“I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post,”
Grenn
added,
nodding.

“You
don’t
have
to
tell
me
the
words,
I
know
them
as
well
as
you
do.”
He
was
angry
now.
Why
couldn’t
they
let
him
go
in
peace?
They
were
only
making
it
harder.

“I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness,”
Halder
intoned.

“The
watcher
on
the
walls,”
piped
Toad.

Jon
cursed
them
all
to
their
faces.
They
took
no
notice.
Pyp
spurred
his
horse
closer,
reciting,
“I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
>>>>>>> asd
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
men.

A
hunting
horn
echoed
through
the
mountains,
and
a
moment
later
Jon
heard
the
baying
of
hounds.
“They
will
be
with
us
soon,”
announced
Qhorin.
“Keep
your
wolf
in
hand.”

“Ghost,
to
me,”
Jon
called.
The
direwolf
returned
reluctantly
to
his
side,
tail
held
stiffly
behind
him.

The
wildlings
came
boiling
over
a
ridge
not
half
a
mile
away.
Their
hounds
ran
before
them,
snarling
grey-brown
beasts
with
more
than
a
little
wolf
in
their
blood.
Ghost
bared
his
teeth,
his
fur
bristling.
“Easy,”
Jon
murmured.
“Stay.”
Overhead
he
heard
a
rustle
of
wings.
The
eagle
landed
on
an
outcrop
of
rock
and
screamed
in
triumph.

The
hunters
approached
warily,
perhaps
fearing
arrows.
Jon
counted
fourteen,
with
eight
dogs.
Their
large
round
shields
were
made
of
skins
stretched
over
woven
wicker
and
painted
with
skulls.
About
half
of
them
hid
their
faces
behind
crude
helms
of
wood
and
boiled
leather.
On
either
wing,
archers
notched
shafts
to
the
strings
of
small
wood-and-horn
bows,
but
did
not
loose.
The
rest
seemed
to
be
armed
with
spears
and
mauls.
One
had
a
chipped
stone
axe.
They
wore
only
what
bits
of
armor
they
had
looted
from
dead
rangers
or
stolen
during
raids.
Wildlings
did
not
mine
or
smelt,
and
there
were
few
smiths
and
fewer
forges
north
of
the
Wall.

Qhorin
drew
his
longsword.
The
tale
of
how
he
had
taught
himself
to
fight
with
his
left
hand
after
losing
half
of
his
right
was
part
of
his
legend;
it
was
said
that
he
handled
a
blade
better
now
than
he
ever
had
before.
Jon
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
big
ranger
and
pulled
Longclaw
from
its
sheath.
Despite
the
chill
in
the
air,
sweat
stung
his
eyes.

Ten
yards
below
the
cave
mouth
the
hunters
halted.
Their
leader
came
on
alone,
riding
a
beast
that
seemed
more
goat
than
horse,
from
the
surefooted
way
it
climbed
the
uneven
slope.
As
man
and
mount
grew
nearer
Jon
could
hear
them
clattering;
both
were
armored
in
bones.
Cow
bones,
sheep
bones,
the
bones
of
goats
and
aurochs
and
elk,
the
great
bones
of
the
hairy
mammoths…
and
human
bones
as
well.

“Rattleshirt,”
Qhorin
called
down,
icy-polite.

“To
crows
I
be
the
Lord
o’
Bones.”
The
rider’s
helm
was
made
from
the
broken
skull
of
a
giant,
and
all
up
and
down
his
arms
bearclaws
had
been
sewn
to
his
boiled
leather.

Qhorin
snorted.
“I
see
no
lord.
Only
a
dog
dressed
in
chickenbones,
who
rattles
when
he
rides.”

The
wildling
hissed
in
anger,
and
his
mount
reared.
He
did
rattle,
Jon
could
hear
it;
the
bones
were
strung
together
loosely,
so
they
clacked
and
clattered
when
he
moved.
“It’s
your
bones
I’ll
be
rattling
soon,
Halfhand.
I’ll
boil
the
flesh
off
you
and
make
a
byrnie
from
your
ribs.
I’ll
carve
your
teeth
to
cast
me
runes,
and
eat
me
oaten
porridge
from
your
skull.”

“If
you
want
my
bones,
come
get
them.”

That,
Rattleshirt
seemed
reluctant
to
do.
His
numbers
meant
little
in
the
close
confines
of
the
rocks
where
the
black
brothers
had
taken
their
stand;
to
winkle
them
out
of
the
cave
the
wildlings
would
need
to
come
up
two
at
a
time.
But
another
of
his
company
edged
a
horse
up
beside
him,
one
of
the
fighting
women
called
spearwives.
“We
are
four-and-ten
to
two,
crows,
and
eight
dogs
to
your
wolf,”
she
called.
“Fight
or
run,
you
are
ours.”

“Show
them,”
commanded
Rattleshirt.

The
woman
reached
into
a
bloodstained
sack
and
drew
out
a
trophy.
Ebben
had
been
bald
as
an
egg,
so
she
dangled
the
head
by
an
ear.
“He
died
brave,”
she
said.

“But
he
died,”
said
Rattleshirt,
“same
like
you.”
He
freed
his
battleaxe,
brandishing
it
above
his
head.
Good
steel
it
was,
with
a
wicked
gleam
to
both
blades;
Ebben
was
never
a
man
to
neglect
his
weapons.
The
other
wildlings
crowded
forward
beside
him,
yelling
taunts.
A
few
chose
Jon
for
their
mockery.
“Is
that
your
wolf,
boy?”
a
skinny
youth
called,
unlimbering
a
stone
flail.
“He’ll
be
my
cloak
before
the
sun
is
down.”
On
the
other
side
of
the
line,
another
spearwife
opened
her
ragged
furs
to
show
Jon
a
heavy
white
breast.
“Does
the
baby
want
his
momma?
Come,
have
a
suck
o’
this,
boy.”
The
dogs
were
barking
too.

“They
would
shame
us
into
folly.”
Qhorin
gave
Jon
a
long
look.
“Remember
your
orders.”

“Belike
we
need
to
flush
the
crows,”
Rattleshirt
bellowed
over
the
clamor.
“Feather
them!”

“No!”
The
word
burst
from
Jon’s
lips
before
the
bowmen
could
loose.
He
took
two
quick
steps
forward.
“We
yield!”

“They
warned
me
bastard
blood
was
craven,”
he
heard
Qhorin
Halfhand
say
coldly
behind
him.
“I
see
it
is
so.
Run
to
your
new
masters,
coward.”

Face
reddening,
Jon
descended
the
slope
to
where
Rattleshirt
sat
his
horse.
The
wildling
stared
at
him
through
the
eyeholes
of
his
helm,
and
said,
“The
free
folk
have
no
need
of
cravens.”

“He
is
no
craven.”
One
of
the
archers
pulled
off
her
sewn
sheepskin
helm
and
shook
out
a
head
of
shaggy
red
hair.
“This
is
the
Bastard
o’
Winterfell,
who
spared
me.
Let
him
live.”

Jon
met
Ygritte’s
eyes,
and
had
no
words.

“Let
him
die,”
insisted
the
Lord
of
Bones.
“The
black
crow
is
a
tricksy
bird.
I
trust
him
not.”

On
a
rock
above
them,
the
eagle
flapped
its
wings
and
split
the
air
with
a
scream
of
fury.

“The
bird
hates
you,
Jon
Snow,”
said
Ygritte.
“And
well
he
might.
He
was
a
man,
before
you
killed
him.”

“I
did
not
know,”
said
Jon
truthfully,
trying
to
remember
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
slain
in
the
pass.
“You
told
me
Mance
would
take
me.”

“And
he
will,”
Ygritte
said.

“Mance
is
not
here,”
said
Rattleshirt.
“Ragwyle,
gut
him.”

The
big
spearwife
narrowed
her
eyes
and
said,
“If
the
crow
would
join
the
free
folk,
let
him
show
us
his
prowess
and
prove
the
truth
of
him.”

“I’ll
do
whatever
you
ask.”
The
words
came
hard,
but
Jon
said
them.

Rattleshirt’s
bone
armor
clattered
loudly
as
he
laughed.
“Then
kill
the
Halfhand,
bastard.”

“As
if
he
could,”
said
Qhorin.
“Turn,
Snow,
and
die.”

And
then
Qhorin’s
sword
was
coming
at
him
and
somehow
Longclaw
leapt
upward
to
block.
The
force
of
impact
almost
knocked
the
bastard
blade
from
Jon’s
hand,
and
sent
him
staggering
backward.
You
must
not
balk,
whatever
is
asked
of
you.
He
shifted
to
a
two-hand
grip,
quick
enough
to
deliver
a
stroke
of
his
own,
but
the
big
ranger
brushed
it
aside
with
contemptuous
ease.
Back
and
forth
they
went,
black
cloaks
swirling,
the
youth’s
quickness
against
the
savage
strength
of
Qhorin’s
left-hand
cuts.
The
Halfhand’s
longsword
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once,
raining
down
from
one
side
and
then
the
other,
driving
him
where
he
would,
keeping
him
off
balance.
Already
he
could
feel
his
arms
growing
numb.

Even
when
Ghost’s
teeth
closed
savagely
around
the
ranger’s
calf,
somehow
Qhorin
kept
his
feet.
But
in
that
instant,
as
he
twisted,
the
opening
was
there.
Jon
planted
and
pivoted.
The
ranger
was
leaning
away,
and
for
an
instant
it
seemed
that
Jon’s
slash
had
not
touched
him.
Then
a
string
of
red
tears
appeared
across
the
big
man’s
throat,
bright
as
a
ruby
necklace,
and
the
blood
gushed
out
of
him,
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
fell.

Ghost’s
muzzle
was
dripping
red,
but
only
the
point
of
the
bastard
blade
was
stained,
the
last
half
inch.
Jon
pulled
the
direwolf
away
and
knelt
with
one
arm
around
him.
The
light
was
already
fading
in
Qhorin’s
eyes.
“…sharp,”
he
said,
lifting
his
maimed
fingers.
Then
his
hand
fell,
and
he
was
gone.

He
knew,
he
thought
numbly.
He
knew
what
they
would
ask
of
me.
He
thought
of
Samwell
Tarly
then,
of
Grenn
and
Dolorous
Edd,
of
Pyp
and
Toad
back
at
Castle
Black.
Had
he
lost
them
all,
as
he
had
lost
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb?
Who
was
he
now?
What
was
he?

“Get
him
up.”
Rough
hands
dragged
him
to
his
feet.
Jon
did
not
resist.
“Do
you
have
a
name?”

Ygritte
answered
for
him.
“His
name
is
Jon
Snow.
He
is
Eddard
Stark’s
blood,
of
Winterfell.”

Ragwyle
laughed.
“Who
would
have
thought
it?
Qhorin
Halfhand
slain
by
some
lordling’s
byblow.”

“Gut
him.”
That
was
Rattleshirt,
still
ahorse.
The
eagle
flew
to
him
and
perched
atop
his
bony
helm,
screeching.

“He
yielded,”
Ygritte
reminded
them.

“Aye,
and
slew
his
brother,”
said
a
short
homely
man
in
a
rust-eaten
iron
halfhelm.

Rattleshirt
rode
closer,
bones
clattering.
“The
wolf
did
his
work
for
him.
It
were
foully
done.
The
Halfhand’s
death
was
mine.”

“We
all
saw
how
eager
you
were
to
take
it,”
mocked
Ragwyle.

“He
is
a
warg,”
said
the
Lord
of
Bones,
“and
a
crow.
I
like
him
not.”

“A
warg
he
may
be,”
Ygritte
said,
“but
that
has
never
frightened
us.”
Others
shouted
agreement.
Behind
the
eyeholes
of
his
yellowed
skull
Rattleshirt’s
stare
was
malignant,
but
he
yielded
grudgingly.
These
are
a
free
folk
indeed,
thought
Jon.

They
burned
Qhorin
Halfhand
where
he’d
fallen,
on
a
pyre
made
of
pine
needles,
brush,
and
broken
branches.
Some
of
the
wood
was
still
green,
and
it
burned
slow
and
smoky,
sending
a
black
plume
up
into
the
bright
hard
blue
of
the
sky.
Afterward
Rattleshirt
claimed
some
charred
bones,
while
the
others
threw
dice
for
the
ranger’s
gear.
Ygritte
won
his
cloak.

“Will
we
return
by
the
Skirling
Pass?”
Jon
asked
her.
He
did
not
know
if
he
could
face
those
heights
again,
or
if
his
garron
could
survive
a
second
crossing.

“No,”
she
said.
“There’s
nothing
behind
us.”
The
look
she
gave
him
was
sad.
“By
now
Mance
is
well
down
the
Milkwater,
marching
on
your
Wall.”
=======
men.”

“Stay
back,”
Jon
warned
him,
brandishing
his
sword.
“I
mean
it,
Pyp.”
They
weren’t
even
wearing
armor,
he
could
cut
them
to
pieces
if
he
had
to.

Matthar
had
circled
behind
him.
He
joined
the
chorus.
“I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Jon
kicked
his
mare,
spinning
her
in
a
circle.
The
boys
were
all
around
him
now,
closing
from
every
side.

“For
this
night…”
Halder
trotted
in
from
the
left.

“…and
all
the
nights
to
come,”
finished
Pyp.
He
reached
over
for
Jon’s
reins.
“So
here
are
your
choices.
Kill
me,
or
come
back
with
me.”

Jon
lifted
his
sword…
and
lowered
it,
helpless.
“Damn
you,”
he
said.
“Damn
you
all.”

“Do
we
have
to
bind
your
hands,
or
will
you
give
us
your
word
you’ll
ride
back
peaceful?”
asked
Halder.

“I
won’t
run,
if
that’s
what
you
mean.”
Ghost
moved
out
from
under
the
trees
and
Jon
glared
at
him.
“Small
help
you
were,”
he
said.
The
deep
red
eyes
looked
at
him
knowingly.

“We
had
best
hurry,”
Pyp
said.
“If
we’re
not
back
before
first
light,
the
Old
Bear
will
have
all
our
heads.”

Of
the
ride
back,
Jon
Snow
remembered
little.
It
seemed
shorter
than
the
journey
south,
perhaps
because
his
mind
was
elsewhere.
Pyp
set
the
pace,
galloping,
walking,
trotting,
and
then
breaking
into
another
gallop.
Mole’s
Town
came
and
went,
the
red
lantern
over
the
brothel
long
extinguished.
They
made
good
time.
Dawn
was
still
an
hour
off
when
Jon
glimpsed
the
towers
of
Castle
Black
ahead
of
them,
dark
against
the
pale
immensity
of
the
Wall.
It
did
not
seem
like
home
this
time.

They
could
take
him
back,
Jon
told
himself,
but
they
could
not
make
him
stay.
The
war
would
not
end
on
the
morrow,
or
the
day
after,
and
his
friends
could
not
watch
him
day
and
night.
He
would
bide
his
time,
make
them
think
he
was
content
to
remain
here…
and
then,
when
they
had
grown
lax,
he
would
be
off
again.
Next
time
he
would
avoid
the
kingsroad.
He
could
follow
the
Wall
east,
perhaps
all
the
way
to
the
sea,
a
longer
route
but
a
safer
one.
Or
even
west,
to
the
mountains,
and
then
south
over
the
high
passes.
That
was
the
wildling’s
way,
hard
and
perilous,
but
at
least
no
one
wouid
follow
him.
He
wouldn’t
stray
within
a
hundred
leagues
of
Winterfell
or
the
kingsroad.

Samwell
Tarly
awaited
them
in
the
old
stables,
slumped
on
the
ground
against
a
bale
of
hay,
too
anxious
to
sleep.
He
rose
and
brushed
himself
off.
“I…
I’m
glad
they
found
you,
Jon.”

“I’m
not,”
Jon
said,
dismounting.

Pyp
hopped
off
his
horse
and
looked
at
the
lightening
sky
with
disgust.
“Give
us
a
hand
bedding
down
the
horses,
Sam,”
the
small
boy
said.
“We
have
a
long
day
before
us,
and
no
sleep
to
face
it
on,
thanks
to
Lord
Snow.”

When
day
broke,
Jon
walked
to
the
kitchens
as
he
did
every
dawn.
Three-Finger
Hobb
said
nothing
as
he
gave
him
the
Old
Bear’s
breakfast.
Today
it
was
three
brown
eggs
boiled
hard,
with
fried
bread
and
ham
steak
and
a
bowl
of
wrinkled
plums.
Jon
carried
the
food
back
to
the
King’s
Tower.
He
found
Mormont
at
the
window
seat,
writing.
His
raven
was
walking
back
and
forth
across
his
shoulders,
muttering,
“Corn,
corn,
corn.”
The
bird
shrieked
when
Jon
entered.
“Put
the
food
on
the
table,”
the
Old
Bear
said,
glancing
up.
“I’ll
have
some
beer.”

Jon
opened
a
shuttered
window,
took
the
flagon
of
beer
off
the
outside
ledge,
and
filled
a
horn.
Hobb
had
given
him
a
lemon,
still
cold
from
the
Wall.
Jon
crushed
it
in
his
fist.
The
juice
trickled
through
his
fingers.
Mormont
drank
lemon
in
his
beer
every
day,
and
claimed
that
was
why
he
still
had
his
own
teeth.

“Doubtless
you
loved
your
father,”
Mormont
said
when
Jon
brought
him
his
horn.
“The
things
we
love
destroy
us
every
time,
lad.
Remember
when
I
told
you
that?”

“I
remember,”
Jon
said
sullenly.
He
did
not
care
to
talk
of
his
father’s
death,
not
even
to
Mormont.

“See
that
you
never
forget
it.
The
hard
truths
are
the
ones
to
hold
tight.
Fetch
me
my
plate.
Is
it
ham
again?
So
be
it.
You
look
weary.
Was
your
moonlight
ride
so
tiring?”

Jon’s
throat
was
dry.
“You
know?”

“Know,”
the
raven
echoed
from
Mormont’s
shoulder.
“Know.”

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
“Do
you
think
they
chose
me
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch
because
I’m
dumb
as
a
stump,
Snow?
Aemon
told
me
you’d
go.
I
told
him
you’d
be
back.
I
know
my
men…
and
my
boys
too.
Honor
set
you
on
the
kingsroad…
and
honor
brought
you
back.”

“My
friends
brought
me
back,”
Jon
said.

“Did
I
say
it
was
your
honor?”
Mormont
inspected
his
plate.

“They
killed
my
father.
Did
you
expect
me
to
do
nothing?”

“If
truth
be
told,
we
expected
you
to
do
just
as
you
did.”
Mormont
tried
a
plum,
spit
out
the
pit.
“I
ordered
a
watch
kept
over
you.,
You
were
seen
leaving.
If
your
brothers
had
not
fetched
you
back,
you
would
have
been
taken
along
the
way,
and
not
by
friends.
Unless
you
have
a
horse
with
wings
like
a
raven.
Do
you?”

“No.”
Jon
felt
like
a
fool.

“Pity,
we
could
use
a
horse
like
that.”

Jon
stood
tall.
He
told
himself
that
he
would
die
well;
that
much
he
could
do,
at
the
least.
“I
know
the
penalty
for
desertion,
my
lord.
I’m
not
afraid
to
die.”

“Die!”
the
raven
cried.

“Nor
live,
I
hope,”
Mormont
said,
cutting
his
ham
with
a
dagger
and
feeding
a
bite
to
the
bird.
“You
have
not
deserted—yet.
Here
you
stand.
If
we
beheaded
every
boy
who
rode
to
Mole’s
Town
in
the
night,
only
ghosts
would
guard
the
Wall.
Yet
maybe
you
mean
to
flee
again
on
the
morrow,
or
a
fortnight
from
now.
Is
that
it?
Is
that
your
hope,
boy?”

Jon
kept
silent.

“I
thought
so.”
Mormont
peeled
the
shell
off
a
boiled
egg.
“Your
father
is
dead,
lad.
Do
you
think
you
can
bring
him
back?”

“No,”
he
answered,
sullen.

“Good,”
Mormont
said.
“We’ve
seen
the
dead
come
back,
you
and
me,
and
it’s
not
something
I
care
to
see
again.”
He
ate
the
egg
in
two
bites
and
flicked
a
bit
of
shell
out
from
between
his
teeth.
“Your
brother
is
in
the
field
with
all
the
power
of
the
north
behind
him.
Any
one
of
his
lords
bannermen
commands
more
swords
than
you’ll
find
in
all
the
Night’s
Watch.
Why
do
you
imagine
that
they
need
your
help?
Are
you
such
a
mighty
warrior,
or
do
you
carry
a
grumkin
in
your
pocket
to
magic
up
your
sword?”

Jon
had
no
answer
for
him.
The
raven
was
pecking
at
an
egg,
breaking
the
shell.
Pushing
his
beak
through
the
hole,
he
pulled
out
morsels
of
white
and
yoke.

The
Old
Bear
sighed.
“You
are
not
the
only
one
touched
by
this
war.
Like
as
not,
my
sister
is
marching
in
your
brother’s
host,
her
and
those
daughters
of
hers,
dressed
in
men’s
mail.
Maege
is
a
hoary
old
snark,
stubborn,
short-tempered,
and
willful.
Truth
be
told,
I
can
hardly
stand
to
be
around
the
wretched
woman,
but
that
does
not
mean
my
love
for
her
is
any
less
than
the
love
you
bear
your
half
sisters.”
Frowning,
Mormont
took
his
last
egg
and
squeezed
it
in
his
fist
until
the
shell
crunched.
“Or
perhaps
it
does.
Be
that
as
it
may,
I’d
still
grieve
if
she
were
slain,
yet
you
don’t
see
me
running
off.
I
said
the
words,
just
as
you
did.
My
place
is
here…
where
is
yours,
boy?”

I
have
no
place,
Jon
wanted
to
say,
I’m
a
bastard,
I
have
no
rights,
no
name,
no
mother,
and
now
not
even
a
father.
The
words
would
not
come.
“I
don’t
know.”

“I
do,”
said
Lord
Commander
Mormont.
“The
cold
winds
are
rising,
Snow.
Beyond
the
Wall,
the
shadows
lengthen.
Cotter
Pyke
writes
of
vast
herds
of
elk,
streaming
south
and
east
toward
the
sea,
and
mammoths
as
well.
He
says
one
of
his
men
discovered
huge,
misshapen
footprints
not
three
leagues
from
Eastwatch.
Rangers
from
the
Shadow
Tower
have
found
whole
villages
abandoned,
and
at
night
Ser
Denys
says
they
see
fires
in
the
mountains,
huge
blazes
that
burn
from
dusk
till
dawn.
Quorin
Halfhand
took
a
captive
in
the
depths
of
the
Gorge,
and
the
man
swears
that
Mance
Rayder
is
massing
all
his
people
in
some
new,
secret
stronghold
he’s
found,
to
what
end
the
gods
only
know.
Do
you
think
your
uncle
Benjen
was
the
only
ranger
we’ve
lost
this
past
year?”

“Ben
Jen,”
the
raven
squawked,
bobbing
its
head,
bits
of
egg
dribbling
from
its
beak.
“Ben
Jen.
Ben
Jen.”

“No,”
Jon
said.
There
had
been
others.
Too
many.

“Do
you
think
your
brother’s
war
is
more
important
than
ours?”
the
old
man
barked.

Jon
chewed
his
lip.
The
raven
flapped
its
wings
at
him.
“War,
war,
war,
war,”
it
sang.

“It’s
not,”
Mormont
told
him.
“Gods
save
us,
boy,
you’re
not
blind
and
you’re
not
stupid.
When
dead
men
come
hunting
in
the
night,
do
you
think
it
matters
who
sits
the
Iron
Throne?”

“No.”
Jon
had
not
thought
of
it
that
way.

“Your
lord
father
sent
you
to
us,
Jon.
Why,
who
can
say?”

“Why?
Why?
Why?”
the
raven
called.

“All
I
know
is
that
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks.
The
First
Men
built
the
Wall,
and
it’s
said
they
remember
things
otherwise
forgotten.
And
that
beast
of
yours…
he
led
us
to
the
wights,
warned
you
of
the
dead
man
on
the
steps.
Ser
Jaremy
would
doubtless
call
that
happenstance,
yet
Ser
Jaremy
is
dead
and
I’m
not.”
Lord
Mormont
stabbed
a
chunk
of
ham
with
the
point
of
his
dagger.
“I
think
you
were
meant
to
be
here,
and
I
want
you
and
that
wolf
of
yours
with
us
when
we
go
beyond
the
Wall.”

His
words
sent
a
chill
of
excitement
down
Jon’s
back.
“Beyond
the
Wall?”

“You
heard
me.
I
mean
to
find
Ben
Stark,
alive
or
dead.”
He
chewed
and
swallowed.
“I
will
not
sit
here
meekly
and
wait
for
the
snows
and
the
ice
winds.
We
must
know
what
is
happening.
This
time
the
Night’s
Watch
will
ride
in
force,
against
the
King-beyond-the-Wall,
the
Others,
and
anything
else
that
may
be
out
there.
I
mean
to
command
them
myself.”
He
pointed
his
dagger
at
Jon’s
chest.
“By
custom,
the
Lord
Commander’s
steward
is
his
squire
as
well…
but
I
do
not
care
to
wake
every
dawn
wondering
if
you’ve
run
off
again.
So
I
will
have
an
answer
from
you,
Lord
Snow,
and
I
will
have
it
now.
Are
you
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch…
or
only
a
bastard
boy
who
wants
to
play
at
war?”

Jon
Snow
straightened
himself
and
took
a
long
deep
breath.
Forgive
me,
Father.
Robb,
Arya,
Bran…
forgive
me,
I
cannot
help
you.
He
has
the
truth
of
it.
This
is
my
place.
“I
am…
yours,
my
lord.
Your
man.
I
swear
it.
I
will
not
run
again.”

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
“Good.
Now
go
put
on
your
sword.”

BRAN

The
ashes
fell
like
a
soft
grey
snow.

He
padded
over
dry
needles
and
brown
leaves,
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
the
pines
grew
thin.
Beyond
the
open
fields
he
could
see
the
great
piles
of
man-rock
stark
against
the
swirling
flames.
The
wind
blew
hot
and
rich
with
the
smell
of
blood
and
burnt
meat,
so
strong
he
began
to
slaver.

Yet
as
one
smell
drew
them
onward,
others
warned
them
back.
He
sniffed
at
the
drifting
smoke.
Men,
many
men,
many
horses,
and
fire,
fire,
fire.
No
smell
was
more
dangerous,
not
even
the
hard
cold
smell
of
iron,
the
stuff
of
man-claws
and
hardskin.
The
smoke
and
ash
clouded
his
eyes,
and
in
the
sky
he
saw
a
great
winged
snake
whose
roar
was
a
river
of
flame.
He
bared
his
teeth,
but
then
the
snake
was
gone.
Behind
the
cliffs
tall
fires
were
eating
up
the
stars.

All
through
the
night
the
fires
crackled,
and
once
there
was
a
great
roar
and
a
crash
that
made
the
earth
jump
under
his
feet.
Dogs
barked
and
whined
and
horses
screamed
in
terror.
Howls
shuddered
through
the
night;
the
howls
of
the
man-pack,
wails
of
fear
and
wild
shouts,
laughter
and
screams.
No
beast
was
as
noisy
as
man.
He
pricked
up
his
ears
and
listened,
and
his
brother
growled
at
every
sound.
They
prowled
under
the
trees
as
a
piney
wind
blew
ashes
and
embers
through
the
sky.
In
time
the
flames
began
to
dwindle,
and
then
they
were
gone.
The
sun
rose
grey
and
smoky
that
morning.

Only
then
did
he
leave
the
trees,
stalking
slow
across
the
fields.
His
brother
ran
with
him,
drawn
to
the
smell
of
blood
and
death.
They
padded
silent
through
the
dens
the
men
had
built
of
wood
and
grass
and
mud.
Many
and
more
were
burned
and
many
and
more
were
collapsed;
others
stood
as
they
had
before.
Yet
nowhere
did
they
see
or
scent
a
living
man.
Crows
blanketed
the
bodies
and
leapt
into
the
air
screeching
when
his
brother
and
he
came
near.
The
wild
dogs
slunk
away
before
them.

Beneath
the
great
grey
cliffs
a
horse
was
dying
noisily,
struggling
to
rise
on
a
broken
leg
and
screaming
when
he
fell.
His
brother
circled
round
him,
then
tore
out
his
throat
while
the
horse
kicked
feebly
and
rolled
his
eyes.
When
he
approached
the
carcass
his
brother
snapped
at
him
and
laid
back
his
ears,
and
he
cuffed
him
with
a
forepaw
and
bit
his
leg.
They
fought
amidst
the
grass
and
dirt
and
falling
ashes
beside
the
dead
horse,
until
his
brother
rolled
on
his
back
in
submission,
tail
tucked
low.
One
more
bite
at
his
upturned
throat;
then
he
fed,
and
let
his
brother
feed,
and
licked
the
blood
off
his
black
fur.

The
dark
place
was
pulling
at
him
by
then,
the
house
of
whispers
where
all
men
were
blind.
He
could
feel
its
cold
fingers
on
him.
The
stony
smell
of
it
was
a
whisper
up
the
nose.
He
struggled
against
the
pull.
He
did
not
like
the
darkness.
He
was
wolf.
He
was
hunter
and
stalker
and
slayer,
and
he
belonged
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
deep
woods,
running
free
beneath
a
starry
sky.
He
sat
on
his
haunches,
raised
his
head,
and
howled.
I
will
not
go,
he
cried.
I
am
wolf,
I
will
not
go.
Yet
even
so
the
darkness
thickened,
until
it
covered
his
eyes
and
filled
his
nose
and
stopped
his
ears,
so
he
could
not
see
or
smell
or
hear
or
run,
and
the
grey
cliffs
were
gone
and
the
dead
horse
was
gone
and
his
brother
was
gone
and
all
was
black
and
still
and
black
and
cold
and
black
and
dead
and
black…

“Bran,”
a
voice
was
whispering
softly.
“Bran,
come
back.
Come
back
now,
Bran.
Bran…”

He
closed
his
third
eye
and
opened
the
other
two,
the
old
two,
the
blind
two.
In
the
dark
place
all
men
were
blind.
But
someone
was
holding
him.
He
could
feel
arms
around
him,
the
warmth
of
a
body
snuggled
close.
He
could
hear
Hodor
singing
“Hodor,
hodor,
hodor,”
quietly
to
himself.

“Bran?”
It
was
Meera’s
voice.
“You
were
thrashing,
making
terrible
noises.
What
did
you
see?”

“Winterfell.”
His
tongue
felt
strange
and
thick
in
his
mouth.
One
day
when
I
come
back
I
won’t
know
how
to
talk
anymore.
“It
was
Winterfell.
It
was
all
on
fire.
There
were
horse
smells,
and
steel,
and
blood.
They
killed
everyone,
Meera.”

He
felt
her
hand
on
his
face,
stroking
back
his
hair.
“You’re
all
sweaty,”
she
said.
“Do
you
need
a
drink?”

“A
drink,”
he
agreed.
She
held
a
skin
to
his
lips,
and
Bran
swallowed
so
fast
the
water
ran
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth.
He
was
always
weak
and
thirsty
when
he
came
back.
And
hungry
too.
He
remembered
the
dying
horse,
the
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth,
the
smell
of
burnt
flesh
in
the
morning
air.
“How
long?”

“Three
days,”
said
Jojen.
The
boy
had
come
up
softfoot,
or
perhaps
he
had
been
there
all
along;
in
this
blind
black
world,
Bran
could
not
have
said.
“We
were
afraid
for
you.”

“I
was
with
Summer,”
Bran
said.

“Too
long.
You’ll
starve
yourself.
Meera
dribbled
a
little
water
down
your
throat,
and
we
smeared
honey
on
your
mouth,
but
it
is
not
enough.”

“I
ate,”
said
Bran.
“We
ran
down
an
elk
and
had
to
drive
off
a
treecat
that
tried
to
steal
him.”
The
cat
had
been
tan-and-brown,
only
half
the
size
of
the
direwolves,
but
fierce.
He
remembered
the
musky
smell
of
him,
and
the
way
he
had
snarled
down
at
them
from
the
limb
of
the
oak.

“The
wolf
ate,”
Jojen
said.
“Not
you.
Take
care,
Bran.
Remember
who
you
are.”

He
remembered
who
he
was
all
too
well;
Bran
the
boy,
Bran
the
broken.
Better
Bran
the
beastling.
Was
it
any
wonder
he
would
sooner
dream
his
Summer
dreams,
his
wolf
dreams?
Here
in
the
chill
damp
darkness
of
the
tomb
his
third
eye
had
finally
opened.
He
could
reach
Summer
whenever
he
wanted,
and
once
he
had
even
touched
Ghost
and
talked
to
Jon.
Though
maybe
he
had
only
dreamed
that.
He
could
not
understand
why
Jojen
was
always
trying
to
pull
him
back
now.
Bran
used
the
strength
of
his
arms
to
squirm
to
a
sitting
position.
“I
have
to
tell
Osha
what
I
saw.
Is
she
here?
Where
did
she
go?”

The
wildling
woman
herself
gave
answer.
“Nowhere,
m’lord.
I’ve
had
my
fill
o’
blundering
in
the
black.”
He
heard
the
scrape
of
a
heel
on
stone,
turned
his
head
toward
the
sound,
but
saw
nothing.
He
thought
he
could
smell
her,
but
he
wasn’t
sure.
All
of
them
stank
alike,
and
he
did
not
have
Summer’s
nose
to
tell
one
from
the
other.
“Last
night
I
pissed
on
a
king’s
foot,”
Osha
went
on.
“Might
be
it
was
morning,
who
can
say?
I
was
sleeping,
but
now
I’m
not.”
They
all
slept
a
lot,
not
only
Bran.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
Sleep
and
eat
and
sleep
again,
and
sometimes
talk
a
little…
but
not
too
much,
and
only
in
whispers,
just
to
be
safe.
Osha
might
have
liked
it
better
if
they
had
never
talked
at
all,
but
there
was
no
way
to
quiet
Rickon,
or
to
stop
Hodor
from
muttering,
“Hodor,
hodor,
hodor,”
endlessly
to
himself.

“Osha,”
Bran
said,
“I
saw
Winterfell
burning.”
Off
to
his
left,
he
could
hear
the
soft
sound
of
Rickon’s
breathing.

“A
dream,”
said
Osha.

“A
wolf
dream,”
said
Bran.
“I
smelled
it
too.
Nothing
smells
like
fire,
or
blood.”

“Whose
blood?”

“Men,
horses,
dogs,
everyone.
We
have
to
go
see.”

“This
scrawny
skin
of
mine’s
the
only
one
I
got,”
said
Osha.
“That
squid
prince
catches
hold
o’
me,
they’ll
strip
it
off
my
back
with
a
whip.”

Meera’s
hand
found
Bran’s
in
the
darkness
and
gave
his
fingers
a
squeeze.
“I’ll
go
if
you’re
afraid.”

Bran
heard
fingers
fumbling
at
leather,
followed
by
the
sound
of
steel
on
flint.
Then
again.
A
spark
flew,
caught.
Osha
blew
softly.
A
long
pale
flame
awoke,
stretching
upward
like
a
girl
on
her
toes.
Osha’s
face
floated
above
it.
She
touched
the
flame
with
the
head
of
a
torch.
Bran
had
to
squint
as
the
pitch
began
to
burn,
filling
the
world
with
orange
glare.
The
light
woke
Rickon,
who
sat
up
yawning.

When
the
shadows
moved,
it
looked
for
an
instant
as
if
the
dead
were
rising
as
well.
Lyanna
and
Brandon,
Lord
Rickard
Stark
their
father,
Lord
Edwyle
his
father,
Lord
Willam
and
his
brother
Artos
the
Implacable,
Lord
Donnor
and
Lord
Beron
and
Lord
Rodwell,
one-eyed
Lord
Jonnel,
Lord
Barth
and
Lord
Brandon
and
Lord
Cregan
who
had
fought
the
Dragonknight.
On
their
stone
chairs
they
sat
with
stone
wolves
at
their
feet.
This
was
where
they
came
when
the
warmth
had
seeped
out
of
their
bodies;
this
was
the
dark
hall
of
the
dead,
where
the
living
feared
to
tread.

And
in
the
mouth
of
the
empty
tomb
that
waited
for
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
beneath
his
stately
granite
likeness,
the
six
fugitives
huddled
round
their
little
cache
of
bread
and
water
and
dried
meat.
“Little
enough
left,”
Osha
muttered
as
she
blinked
down
on
their
stores.
“I’d
need
to
go
up
soon
to
steal
food
in
any
case,
or
we’d
be
down
to
eating
Hodor.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
said,
grinning
at
her.

“Is
it
day
or
night
up
there?”
Osha
wondered.
“I’ve
lost
all
count
o’
such.”

“Day,”
Bran
told
her,
“but
it’s
dark
from
all
the
smoke.”

“M’lord
is
certain?”

Never
moving
his
broken
body,
he
reached
out
all
the
same,
and
for
an
instant
he
was
seeing
double.
There
stood
Osha
holding
the
torch,
and
Meera
and
Jojen
and
Hodor,
and
the
double
row
of
tall
granite
pillars
and
long
dead
lords
behind
them
stretching
away
into
darkness…
but
there
was
Winterfell
as
well,
grey
with
drifting
smoke,
the
massive
oak-and-iron
gates
charred
and
askew,
the
drawbridge
down
in
a
tangle
of
broken
chains
and
missing
planks.
Bodies
floated
in
the
moat,
islands
for
the
crows.

“Certain,”
he
declared.

Osha
chewed
on
that
a
moment.
“I’ll
risk
a
look
then.
I
want
the
lot
o’
you
close
behind.
Meera,
get
Bran’s
basket.”

“Are
we
going
home?”
Rickon
asked
excitedly.
“I
want
my
horse.
And
I
want
applecakes
and
butter
and
honey,
and
Shaggy.
Are
we
going
where
Shaggydog
is?”

“Yes,”
Bran
promised,
“but
you
have
to
be
quiet.”

Meera
strapped
the
wicker
basket
to
Hodor’s
back
and
helped
lift
Bran
into
it,
easing
his
useless
legs
through
the
holes.
He
had
a
queer
flutter
in
his
belly.
He
knew
what
awaited
them
above,
but
that
did
not
make
it
any
less
fearful.
As
they
set
off,
he
turned
to
give
his
father
one
last
look,
and
it
seemed
to
Bran
that
there
was
a
sadness
in
Lord
Eddard’s
eyes,
as
if
he
did
not
want
them
to
go.
We
have
to,
he
thought.
It’s
time.

Osha
carried
her
long
oaken
spear
in
one
hand
and
the
torch
in
the
other.
A
naked
sword
hung
down
her
back,
one
of
the
last
to
bear
Mikken’s
mark.
He
had
forged
it
for
Lord
Eddard’s
tomb,
to
keep
his
ghost
at
rest.
But
with
Mikken
slain
and
the
ironmen
guarding
the
armory,
good
steel
had
been
hard
to
resist,
even
if
it
meant
grave-robbing.
Meera
had
claimed
Lord
Rickard’s
blade,
though
she
complained
that
it
was
too
heavy.
Brandon
took
his
namesake’s,
the
sword
made
for
the
uncle
he
had
never
known.
He
knew
he
would
not
be
much
use
in
a
fight,
but
even
so
the
blade
felt
good
in
his
hand.

But
it
was
only
a
game,
and
Bran
knew
it.

Their
footsteps
echoed
through
the
cavernous
crypts.
The
shadows
behind
them
swallowed
his
father
as
the
shadows
ahead
retreated
to
unveil
other
statues;
no
mere
lords,
these,
but
the
old
Kings
in
the
North.
On
their
brows
they
wore
stone
crowns.
Torrhen
Stark,
the
King
Who
Knelt.
Edwyn
the
Spring
King.
Theon
Stark,
the
Hungry
Wolf.
Brandon
the
Burner
and
Brandon
the
Shipwright.
Jorah
and
Jonos,
Brandon
the
Bad,
Walton
the
Moon
King,
Edderion
the
Bridegroom,
Eyron,
Benjen
the
Sweet
and
Benjen
the
Bitter,
King
Edrick
Snowbeard.
Their
faces
were
stern
and
strong,
and
some
of
them
had
done
terrible
things,
but
they
were
Starks
every
one,
and
Bran
knew
all
their
tales.
He
had
never
feared
the
crypts;
they
were
part
of
his
home
and
who
he
was,
and
he
had
always
known
that
one
day
he
would
lie
here
too.

But
now
he
was
not
so
certain.
If
I
go
up,
will
I
ever
come
back
down?
Where
will
I
go
when
I
die?

“Wait,”
Osha
said
when
they
reached
the
twisting
stone
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
surface,
and
down
to
the
deeper
levels
where
kings
more
ancient
still
sat
their
dark
thrones.
She
handed
Meera
the
torch.
“I’ll
grope
my
way
up.”
For
a
time
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
footfalls,
but
they
grew
softer
and
softer
until
they
faded
away
entirely.
“Hodor,”
said
Hodor
nervously.

Bran
had
told
himself
a
hundred
times
how
much
he
hated
hiding
down
here
in
the
dark,
how
much
he
wanted
to
see
the
sun
again,
to
ride
his
horse
through
wind
and
rain.
But
now
that
the
moment
was
upon
him,
he
was
afraid.
He’d
felt
safe
in
the
darkness;
when
you
could
not
even
find
your
own
hand
in
front
of
your
face,
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
no
enemies
could
ever
find
you
either.
And
the
stone
lords
had
given
him
courage.
Even
when
he
could
not
see
them,
he
had
known
they
were
there.

It
seemed
a
long
while
before
they
heard
anything
again.
Bran
had
begun
to
fear
that
something
had
happened
to
Osha.
His
brother
was
squirming
restlessly.
“I
want
to
go
home!”
he
said
loudly.
Hodor
bobbed
his
head
and
said,
“Hodor.”
Then
they
heard
the
footsteps
again,
growing
louder,
and
after
a
few
minutes
Osha
emerged
into
the
light,
looking
grim.
“Something
is
blocking
the
door.
I
can’t
move
it.”

“Hodor
can
move
anything,”
said
Bran.

Osha
gave
the
huge
stableboy
an
appraising
look.
“Might
be
he
can.
Come
on,
then.”

The
steps
were
narrow,
so
they
had
to
climb
in
single
file.
Osha
led.
Behind
came
Hodor,
with
Bran
crouched
low
on
his
back
so
his
head
wouldn’t
hit
the
ceiling.
Meera
followed
with
the
torch,
and
Jojen
brought
up
the
rear,
leading
Rickon
by
the
hand.
Around
and
around
they
went,
and
up
and
up.
Bran
thought
he
could
smell
smoke
now,
but
perhaps
that
was
only
the
torch.

The
door
to
the
crypts
was
made
of
ironwood.
It
was
old
and
heavy,
and
lay
at
a
slant
to
the
ground.
Only
one
person
could
approach
it
at
a
time.
Osha
tried
once
more
when
she
reached
it,
but
Bran
could
see
that
it
was
not
budging.
“Let
Hodor
try.”

They
had
to
pull
Bran
from
his
basket
first,
so
he
would
not
get
squished.
Meera
squatted
beside
him
on
the
steps,
one
arm
thrown
protectively
across
his
shoulders,
as
Osha
and
Hodor
traded
places.
“Open
the
door,
Hodor,”
Bran
said.

The
huge
stableboy
put
both
hands
flat
on
the
door,
pushed,
and
grunted.
“Hodor?”
He
slammed
a
fist
against
the
wood,
and
it
did
not
so
much
as
jump.
“Hodor.”

“Use
your
back,”
urged
Bran.
“And
your
legs.”

Turning,
Hodor
put
his
back
to
the
wood
and
shoved.
Again.
Again.
“Hodor!”
He
put
one
foot
on
a
higher
step
so
he
was
bent
under
the
slant
of
the
door
and
tried
to
rise.
This
time
the
wood
groaned
and
creaked.
“Hodor!”
The
other
foot
came
up
a
step,
and
Hodor
spread
his
legs
apart,
braced,
and
straightened.
His
face
turned
red,
and
Bran
could
see
cords
in
his
neck
bulging
as
he
strained
against
the
weight
above
him.
“Hodor
hodor
hodor
hodor
hodor
HODOR!”
From
above
came
a
dull
rumble.
Then
suddenly
the
door
jerked
upward
and
a
shaft
of
daylight
fell
across
Bran’s
face,
blinding
him
for
a
moment.
Another
shove
brought
the
sound
of
shifting
stone,
and
then
the
way
was
open.
Osha
poked
her
spear
through
and
slid
out
after
it,
and
Rickon
squirmed
through
Meera’s
legs
to
follow.
Hodor
shoved
the
door
open
all
the
way
and
stepped
to
the
surface.
The
Reeds
had
to
carry
Bran
up
the
last
few
steps.

The
sky
was
a
pale
grey,
and
smoke
eddied
all
around
them.
They
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
First
Keep,
or
what
remained
of
it.
One
whole
side
of
the
building
had
torn
loose
and
fallen
away.
Stone
and
shattered
gargoyles
lay
strewn
across
the
yard.
They
fell
just
where
I
did,
Bran
thought
when
he
saw
them.
Some
of
the
gargoyles
had
broken
into
so
many
pieces
it
made
him
wonder
how
he
was
alive
at
all.
Nearby
some
crows
were
pecking
at
a
body
crushed
beneath
the
tumbled
stone,
but
he
lay
facedown
and
Bran
could
not
say
who
he
was.

The
First
Keep
had
not
been
used
for
many
hundreds
of
years,
but
now
it
was
more
of
a
shell
than
ever.
The
floors
had
burned
inside
it,
and
all
the
beams.
Where
the
wall
had
fallen
away,
they
could
see
right
into
the
rooms,
even
into
the
privy.
Yet
behind,
the
broken
tower
still
stood,
no
more
burned
than
before.
Jojen
Reed
was
coughing
from
the
smoke.
“Take
me
home!”
Rickon
demanded.
“I
want
to
be
home!”
Hodor
stomped
in
a
circle.
“Hodor,”
he
whimpered
in
a
small
voice.
They
stood
huddled
together
with
ruin
and
death
all
around
them.

“We
made
noise
enough
to
wake
a
dragon,”
Osha
said,
“but
there’s
no
one
come.
The
castle’s
dead
and
burned,
just
as
Bran
dreamed,
but
we
had
best—”
She
broke
off
suddenly
at
a
noise
behind
them,
and
whirled
with
her
spear
at
the
ready.

Two
lean
dark
shapes
emerged
from
behind
the
broken
tower,
padding
slowly
through
the
rubble.
Rickon
gave
a
happy
shout
of
“Shaggy!”
and
the
black
direwolf
came
bounding
toward
him.
Summer
advanced
more
slowly,
rubbed
his
head
up
against
Bran’s
arm,
and
licked
his
face.

“We
should
go,”
said
Jojen.
“So
much
death
will
bring
other
wolves
besides
Summer
and
Shaggydog,
and
not
all
on
four
feet.”

“Aye,
soon
enough,”
Osha
agreed,
“but
we
need
food,
and
there
may
be
some
survived
this,
Stay
together.
Meera,
keep
your
shield
up
and
guard
our
backs.”

It
took
the
rest
of
the
morning
to
make
a
slow
circuit
of
the
castle.
The
great
granite
walls
remained,
blackened
here
and
there
by
fire
but
otherwise
untouched.
But
within,
all
was
death
and
destruction.
The
doors
of
the
Great
Hall
were
charred
and
smoldering,
and
inside
the
rafters
had
given
way
and
the
whole
roof
had
crashed
down
onto
the
floor.
The
green
and
yellow
panes
of
the
glass
gardens
were
all
in
shards,
the
trees
and
fruits
and
flowers
torn
up
or
left
exposed
to
die.
Of
the
stables,
made
of
wood
and
thatch,
nothing
remained
but
ashes,
embers,
and
dead
horses.
Bran
thought
of
his
Dancer,
and
wanted
to
weep.
There
was
a
shallow
steaming
lake
beneath
the
Library
Tower,
and
hot
water
gushing
from
a
crack
in
its
side.
The
bridge
between
the
Bell
Tower
and
the
rookery
had
collapsed
into
the
yard
below,
and
Maester
Luwin’s
turret
was
gone.
They
saw
a
dull
red
glow
shining
up
through
the
narrow
cellar
windows
beneath
the
Great
Keep,
and
a
second
fire
still
burning
in
one
of
the
storehouses.

Osha
called
softly
through
the
blowing
smoke
as
they
went,
but
no
one
answered.
They
saw
one
dog
worrying
at
a
corpse,
but
he
ran
when
he
caught
the
scents
of
the
direwolves;
the
rest
had
been
slain
in
the
kennels.
The
maester’s
ravens
were
paying
court
to
some
of
the
corpses,
while
the
crows
from
the
broken
tower
attended
others.
Bran
recognized
Poxy
Tym,
even
though
someone
had
taken
an
axe
to
his
face.
One
charred
corpse,
outside
the
ashen
shell
of
Mother’s
sept,
sat
with
his
arms
drawn
up
and
his
hands
balled
into
hard
black
fists,
as
if
to
punch
anyone
who
dared
approach
him.
“If
the
gods
are
good,”
Osha
said
in
a
low
angry
voice,
“the
Others
will
take
them
that
did
this
work.”

“It
was
Theon,”
Bran
said
blackly.

“No.
Look.”
She
pointed
across
the
yard
with
her
spear.
“That’s
one
of
his
ironmen.
And
there.
And
that’s
Greyjoy’s
warhorse,
see?
The
black
one
with
the
arrows
in
him.”
She
moved
among
the
dead,
frowning.
“And
here’s
Black
Lorren.”
He
had
been
hacked
and
cut
so
badly
that
his
beard
looked
a
reddish-brown
now.
“Took
a
few
with
him,
he
did.”
Osha
turned
over
one
of
the
other
corpses
with
her
foot.
“There’s
a
badge.
A
little
man,
all
red.”

“The
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort,”
said
Bran.

Summer
howled,
and
darted
away.

“The
godswood.”
Meera
Reed
ran
after
the
direwolf,
her
shield
and
frog
spear
to
hand.
The
rest
of
them
trailed
after,
threading
their
way
through
smoke
and
fallen
stones.
The
air
was
sweeter
under
the
trees.
A
few
pines
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
had
been
scorched,
but
deeper
in
the
damp
soil
and
green
wood
had
defeated
the
flames.
“There
is
a
power
in
living
wood,”
said
Jojen
Reed,
almost
as
if
he
knew
what
Bran
was
thinking,
“a
power
strong
as
fire.”

On
the
edge
of
the
black
pool,
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
heart
tree,
Maester
Luwin
lay
on
his
belly
in
the
dirt.
A
trail
of
blood
twisted
back
through
damp
leaves
where
he
had
crawled.
Summer
stood
over
him,
and
Bran
thought
he
was
dead
at
first,
but
when
Meera
touched
his
throat,
the
maester
moaned.
“Hodor?”
Hodor
said
mournfully.
“Hodor?”

Gently,
they
eased
Luwin
onto
his
back.
He
had
grey
eyes
and
grey
hair,
and
once
his
robes
had
been
grey
as
well,
but
they
were
darker
now
where
the
blood
had
soaked
through.
“Bran,”
he
said
softly
when
he
saw
him
sitting
tall
on
Hodor’s
back.
“And
Rickon
too.”
He
smiled.
“The
gods
are
good.
I
knew…”

“Knew?”
said
Bran
uncertainly.

“The
legs,
I
could
tell…
the
clothes
fit,
but
the
muscles
in
his
legs…
poor
lad…”
He
coughed,
and
blood
came
up
from
inside
him.
“You
vanished…
in
the
woods…
how,
though?”

“We
never
went,”
said
Bran.
“Well,
only
to
the
edge,
and
then
doubled
back.
I
sent
the
wolves
on
to
make
a
trail,
but
we
hid
in
Father’s
tomb.”

“The
crypts.”
Luwin
chuckled,
a
froth
of
blood
on
his
lips.
When
the
maester
tried
to
move,
he
gave
a
sharp
gasp
of
pain.

Tears
filled
Bran’s
eyes.
When
a
man
was
hurt
you
took
him
to
the
maester,
but
what
could
you
do
when
your
maester
was
hurt?

“We’ll
need
to
make
a
litter
to
carry
him,”
said
Osha.

“No
use,”
said
Luwin.
“I’m
dying,
woman.”

“You
can’t,”
said
Rickon
angrily.
“No
you
can’t.”
Beside
him,
Shaggydog
bared
his
teeth
and
growled.

The
maester
smiled.
“Hush
now,
child,
I’m
much
older
than
you.
I
can…
die
as
I
please.”

“Hodor,
down,”
said
Bran.
Hodor
went
to
his
knees
beside
the
maester.

“Listen,”
Luwin
said
to
Osha,
“the
princes…
Robb’s
heirs.
Not…
not
together…
do
you
hear?”

The
wildling
woman
leaned
on
her
spear.
“Aye.
Safer
apart.
But
where
to
take
them?
I’d
thought,
might
be
these
Cerwyns…”

Maester
Luwin
shook
his
head,
though
it
was
plain
to
see
what
the
effort
cost
him.
“Cerwyn
boy’s
dead.
Ser
Rodrik,
Leobald
Tallhart,
Lady
Hornwood…
all
slain.
Deepwood
fallen,
Moat
Cailin,
soon
Torrhen’s
Square.
Ironmen
on
the
Stony
Shore.
And
east,
the
Bastard
of
Bolton.”

“Then
where?”
asked
Osha.

“White
Harbor…
the
Umbers…
I
do
not
know…
war
everywhere…
each
man
against
his
neighbor,
and
winter
coming…
such
folly,
such
black
mad
folly…”
Maester
Luwin
reached
up
and
grasped
Bran’s
forearm,
his
fingers
closing
with
a
desperate
strength.
“You
must
be
strong
now.
Strong.”

“I
will
be,”
Bran
said,
though
it
was
hard.
Ser
Rodrik
killed
and
Maester
Luwin,
everyone,
everyone…

“Good,”
the
maester
said.
“A
good
boy.
Your…
your
father’s
son,
Bran.
Now
go.”

Osha
gazed
up
at
the
weirwood,
at
the
red
face
carved
in
the
pale
trunk.
“And
leave
you
for
the
gods?”

“I
beg…”
The
maester
swallowed.
“A…
a
drink
of
water,
and…
another
boon.
If
you
would…”

“Aye.”
She
turned
to
Meera.
“Take
the
boys.”

Jojen
and
Meera
led
Rickon
out
between
them.
Hodor
followed.
Low
branches
whipped
at
Bran’s
face
as
they
pushed
between
the
trees,
and
the
leaves
brushed
away
his
tears.
Osha
joined
them
in
the
yard
a
few
moments
later.
She
said
no
word
of
Maester
Luwin.
“Hodor
must
stay
with
Bran,
to
be
his
legs,”
the
wildling
woman
said
briskly.
“I
will
take
Rickon
with
me.”

“We’ll
go
with
Bran,”
said
Jojen
Reed.

“Aye,
I
thought
you
might,”
said
Osha.
“Believe
I’ll
try
the
East
Gate,
and
follow
the
kingsroad
a
ways.”

“We’ll
take
the
Hunter’s
Gate,”
said
Meera.

“Hodor,”
said
Hodor.

They
stopped
at
the
kitchens
first.
Osha
found
some
loaves
of
burned
bread
that
were
still
edible,
and
even
a
cold
roast
fowl
that
she
ripped
in
half.
Meera
unearthed
a
crock
of
honey
and
a
big
sack
of
apples.
Outside,
they
made
their
farewells.
Rickon
sobbed
and
clung
to
Hodor’s
leg
until
Osha
gave
him
a
smack
with
the
butt
end
of
her
spear.
Then
he
followed
her
quick
enough.
Shaggydog
stalked
after
them.
The
last
Bran
saw
of
them
was
the
direwolf’s
tail
as
it
vanished
behind
the
broken
tower.

The
iron
portcullis
that
closed
the
Hunter’s
Gate
had
been
warped
so
badly
by
heat
it
could
not
be
raised
more
than
a
foot.
They
had
to
squeeze
beneath
its
spikes,
one
by
one.

“Will
we
go
to
your
lord
father?”
Bran
asked
as
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
between
the
walls.
“To
Greywater
Watch?”

Meera
looked
to
her
brother
for
the
answer.
“Our
road
is
north,”
Jojen
announced.

At
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood,
Bran
turned
in
his
basket
for
one
last
glimpse
of
the
castle
that
had
been
his
life.
Wisps
of
smoke
still
rose
into
the
grey
sky,
but
no
more
than
might
have
risen
from
Winterfell’s
chimneys
on
a
cold
autumn
afternoon.
Soot
stains
marked
some
of
the
arrow
loops,
and
here
and
there
a
crack
or
a
missing
merlon
could
be
seen
in
the
curtain
wall,
but
it
seemed
little
enough
from
this
distance.
Beyond,
the
tops
of
the
keeps
and
towers
still
stood
as
they
had
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
that
the
castle
had
been
sacked
and
burned
at
all.
The
stone
is
strong,
Bran
told
himself,
the
roots
of
the
trees
go
deep,
and
under
the
ground
the
Kings
of
Winter
sit
their
thrones.
So
long
as
those
remained,
Winterfell
remained.
It
was
not
dead,
just
broken.
Like
me,
he
thought.
I’m
not
dead
either.

CATELYN

It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
that
Catelyn
Stark
had
carried
her
infant
son
out
of
Riverrun,
crossing
the
Tumblestone
in
a
small
boat
to
begin
their
journey
north
to
Winterfell.
And
it
was
across
the
Tumblestone
that
they
came
home
now,
though
the
boy
wore
plate
and
mail
in
place
of
swaddling
clothes.

Robb
sat
in
the
bow
with
Grey
Wind,
his
hand
resting
on
his
direwolf
s
head
as
the
rowers
pulled
at
their
oars.
Theon
Greyjoy
was
with
him.
Her
uncle
Brynden
would
come
behind
in
the
second
boat,
with
the
Greatjon
and
Lord
Karstark.

Catelyn
took
a
place
toward
the
stern.
They
shot
down
the
Tumblestone,
letting
the
strong
current
push
them
past
the
looming
Wheel
Tower.
The
splash
and
rumble
of
the
great
waterwheel
within
was
a
sound
from
her
girlhood
that
brought
a
sad
smile
to
Catelyn’s
face.
From
the
sandstone
walls
of
the
castle,
soldiers
and
servants
shouted
down
her
name,
and
Robb’s,
and
“Winterfell!”
From
every
rampart
waved
the
banner
of
House
Tully:
a
leaping
trout,
silver,
against
a
rippling
blue-and-red
field.
It
was
a
stirring
sight,
yet
it
did
not
lift
her
heart.
She
wondered
if
indeed
her
heart
would
ever
lift
again.
Oh,
Ned…

Below
the
Wheel
Tower,
they
made
a
wide
turn
and
knifed
through
the
churning
water.
The
men
put
their
backs
into
it.
The
wide
arch
of
the
Water
Gate
came
into
view,
and
she
heard
the
creak
of
heavy
chains
as
the
great
iron
portcullis
was
winched
upward.
It
rose
slowly
as
they
approached,
and
Catelyn
saw
that
the
lower
half
of
it
was
red
with
rust.
The
bottom
foot
dripped
brown
mud
on
them
as
they
passed
underneath,
the
barbed
spikes
mere
inches
above
their
heads.
Catelyn
gazed
up
at
the
bars
and
wondered
how
deep
the
rust
went
and
how
well
the
portcullis
would
stand
up
to
a
ram
and
whether
it
ought
to
be
replaced.
Thoughts
like
that
were
seldom
far
from
her
mind
these
days.

They
passed
beneath
the
arch
and
under
the
walls,
moving
from
sunlight
to
shadow
and
back
into
sunlight.
Boats
large
and
small
were
tied
up
all
around
them,
secured
to
iron
rings
set
in
the
stone.
Her
father’s
guards
waited
on
the
water
stair
with
her
brother.
Ser
Edmure
Tully
was
a
stocky
young
man
with
a
shaggy
head
of
auburn
hair
and
a
fiery
beard.
His
breastplate
was
scratched
and
dented
from
battle,
his
blue-and-red
cloak
stained
by
blood
and
smoke.
At
his
side
stood
the
Lord
Tytos
Blackwood,
a
hard
pike
of
a
man
with
close-cropped
salt-and-pepper
whiskers
and
a
hook
nose.
His
bright
yellow
armor
was
inlaid
with
jet
in
elaborate
vine-and-leaf
patterns,
and
a
cloak
sewn
from
raven
feathers
draped
his
thin
shoulders.
It
had
been
Lord
Tytos
who
led
the
sortie
that
plucked
her
brother
from
the
Lannister
camp.

“Bring
them
in,”
Ser
Edmure
commanded.
Three
men
scrambled
down
the
stairs
knee-deep
in
the
water
and
pulled
the
boat
close
with
long
hooks.
When
Grey
Wind
bounded
out,
one
of
them
dropped
his
pole
and
lurched
back,
stumbling
and
sitting
down
abruptly
in
the
river.
The
others
laughed,
and
the
man
got
a
sheepish
look
on
his
face.
Theon
Greyjoy
vaulted
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
lifted
Catelyn
by
the
waist,
setting
her
on
a
dry
step
above
him
as
water
lapped
around
his
boots.

Edmure
came
down
the
steps
to
embrace
her.
“Sweet
sister,”
he
murmured
hoarsely.
He
had
deep
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
made
for
smiles,
but
he
was
not
smiling
now.
He
looked
worn
and
tired,
battered
by
battle
and
haggard
from
strain.
His
neck
was
bandaged
where
he
had
taken
a
wound.
Catelyn
hugged
him
fiercely.

“Your
grief
is
mine,
Cat,”
he
said
when
they
broke
apart.
“When
we
heard
about
Lord
Eddard…
the
Lannisters
will
pay,
I
swear
it,
you
will
have
your
vengeance.”

“Will
that
bring
Ned
back
to
me?”
she
said
sharply.
The
wound
was
still
too
fresh
for
softer
words.
She
could
not
think
about
Ned
now.
She
would
not.
It
would
not
do.
She
had
to
be
strong.
“All
that
will
keep.
I
must
see
Father.”

“He
awaits
you
in
his
solar,”
Edmure
said.

“Lord
Hoster
is
bedridden,
my
lady,”
her
father’s
steward
explained.
When
had
that
good
man
grown
so
old
and
grey?
“He
instructed
me
to
bring
you
to
him
at
once.”

“I’ll
take
her.”
Edmure
escorted
her
up
the
water
stair
and
across
the
lower
bailey,
where
Petyr
Baelish
and
Brandon
Stark
had
once
crossed
swords
for
her
favor.
The
massive
sandstone
walls
of
the
keep
loomed
above
them.
As
they
pushed
through
a
door
between
two
guardsmen
in
fish-crest
helms,
she
asked,
“How
bad
is
he?”
dreading
the
answer
even
as
she
said
the
words.

Edmure’s
look
was
somber.
“He
will
not
be
with
us
long,
the
maesters
say.
The
pain
is…
constant,
and
grievous.”

A
blind
rage
filled
her,
a
rage
at
all
the
world;
at
her
brother
Edmure
and
her
sister
Lysa,
at
the
Lannisters,
at
the
maesters,
at
Ned
and
her
father
and
the
monstrous
gods
who
would
take
them
both
away
from
her.
“You
should
have
told
me,”
she
said.
“You
should
have
sent
word
as
soon
as
you
knew.”

“He
forbade
it.
He
did
not
want
his
enemies
to
know
that
he
was
dying.
With
the
realm
so
troubled,
he
feared
that
if
the
Lannisters
suspected
how
frail
he
was…”

“…they
might
attack?”
Catelyn
finished,
hard.
It
was
your
doing,
yours,
a
voice
whispered
inside
her.
If
you
had
not
taken
it
upon
yourself
to
seize
the
dwarf…

They
climbed
the
spiral
stair
in
silence.

The
keep
was
three-sided,
like
Riverrun
itself,
and
Lord
Hoster’s
solar
was
triangular
as
well,
with
a
stone
balcony
that
jutted
out
to
the
east
like
the
prow
of
some
great
sandstone
ship.
From
there
the
lord
of
the
castle
could
look
down
on
his
walls
and
battlements,
and
beyond,
to
where
the
waters
met.
They
had
moved
her
father’s
bed
out
onto
the
balcony.
“He
likes
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
watch
the
rivers,”
Edmure
explained.
“Father,
see
who
I’ve
brought.
Cat
has
come
to
see
you…”

Hoster
Tully
had
always
been
a
big
man;
tall
and
broad
in
his
youth,
portly
as
he
grew
older.
Now
he
seemed
shrunken,
the
muscle
and
meat
melted
off
his
bones.
Even
his
face
sagged.
The
last
time
Catelyn
had
seen
him,
his
hair
and
beard
had
been
brown,
well
streaked
with
grey.
Now
they
had
gone
white
as
snow.

His
eyes
opened
to
the
sound
of
Edmure’s
voice.
“Little
cat,”
he
murmured
in
a
voice
thin
and
wispy
and
wracked
by
pain.
“My
little
cat.”
A
tremulous
smile
touched
his
face
as
his
hand
groped
for
hers.
“I
watched
for
you…”

“I
shall
leave
you
to
talk,”
her
brother
said,
kissing
their
lord
father
gently
on
the
brow
before
he
withdrew.

Catelyn
knelt
and
took
her
father’s
hand
in
hers.
It
was
a
big
hand,
but
fleshless
now,
the
bones
moving
loosely
under
the
skin,
all
the
strength
gone
from
it.
“You
should
have
told
me,”
she
said.
“A
rider,
a
raven…”

“Riders
are
taken,
questioned,”
he
answered.
“Ravens
are
brought
down…”
A
spasm
of
pain
took
him,
and
his
fingers
clutched
hers
hard.
“The
crabs
are
in
my
belly…
pinching,
always
pinching.
Day
and
night.
They
have
fierce
claws,
the
crabs.
Maester
Vyman
makes
me
dreamwine,
milk
of
the
poppy…
I
sleep
a
lot…
but
I
wanted
to
be
awake
to
see
you,
when
you
came.
I
was
afraid…
when
the
Lannisters
took
your
brother,
the
camps
all
around
us…
was
afraid
I
would
go,
before
I
could
see
you
again…
I
was
afraid…”

“I’m
here,
Father,”
she
said.
“With
Robb,
my
son.
He’ll
want
to
see
you
too.”

“Your
boy,”
he
whispered.
“He
had
my
eyes,
I
remember…”

“He
did,
and
does.
And
we’ve
brought
you
Jaime
Lannister,
in
irons.
Riverrun
is
free
again,
Father.”

Lord
Hoster
smiled.
“I
saw.
Last
night,
when
it
began,
I
told
them…
had
to
see.
They
carried
me
to
the
gatehouse…
watched
from
the
battlements.
Ah,
that
was
beautiful…
the
torches
came
in
a
wave,
I
could
hear
the
cries
floating
across
the
river…
sweet
cries…
when
that
siege
tower
went
up,
gods…
would
have
died
then,
and
glad,
if
only
I
could
have
seen
you
children
first.
Was
it
your
boy
who
did
it?
Was
it
your
Robb?”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
said,
fiercely
proud.
“It
was
Robb…
and
Brynden.
Your
brother
is
here
as
well,
my
lord.”

“Him.”
Her
father’s
voice
was
a
faint
whisper.
“The
Blackfish…
came
back?
From
the
Vale?”

“Yes.”

“And
Lysa?”
A
cool
wind
moved
through
his
thin
white
hair.
“Gods
be
good,
your
sister…
did
she
come
as
well?”

He
sounded
so
full
of
hope
and
yearning
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
truth.
“No.
I’m
sorry…”

“Oh.”
His
face
fell,
and
some
light
went
out
of
his
eyes.
“I’d
hoped
I
would
have
liked
to
see
her,
before…”

“She’s
with
her
son,
in
the
Eyrie.”

Lord
Hoster
gave
a
weary
nod.
“Lord
Robert
now,
poor
Arryn’s
gone…
I
remember…
why
did
she
not
come
with
you?”

“She
is
frightened,
my
lord.
In
the
Eyrie
she
feels
safe.”
She
kissed
his
wrinkled
brow.
“Robb
will
be
waiting.
Will
you
see
him?
And
Brynden?”

“Your
son,”
he
whispered.
“Yes.
Cat’s
child…
he
had
my
eyes,
I
remember.
When
he
was
born.
Bring
him…
yes.”

“And
your
brother?”

Her
father
glanced
out
over
the
rivers.
“Blackfish,”
he
said.
“Has
he
wed
yet?
Taken
some…
girl
to
wife?”

Even
on
his
deathbed,
Catelyn
thought
sadly.
“He
has
not
wed.
You
know
that,
Father.
Nor
will
he
ever.”

“I
told
him…
commanded
him.
Marry!
I
was
his
lord.
He
knows.
My
right,
to
make
his
match.
A
good
match.
A
Redwyne.
Old
House.
Sweet
girl,
pretty…
freckles…
Bethany,
yes.
Poor
child.
Still
waiting.
Yes.
Still…”

“Bethany
Redwyne
wed
Lord
Rowan
years
ago,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.
“She
has
three
children
by
him.”

“Even
so,”
Lord
Hoster
muttered.
“Even
so.
Spit
on
the
girl.
The
Redwynes.
Spit
on
me.
His
lord,
his
brother…
that
Blackfish.
I
had
other
offers.
Lord
Bracken’s
girl.
Walder
Frey…
any
of
three,
he
said…
Has
he
wed?
Anyone?
Anyone?”

“No
one,”
Catelyn
said,
“yet
he
has
come
many
leagues
to
see
you,
fighting
his
way
back
to
Riverrun.
I
would
not
be
here
now,
if
Ser
Brynden
had
not
helped
us.”

“He
was
ever
a
warrior,”
her
father
husked.
“That
he
could
do.
Knight
of
the
Gate,
yes.”
He
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes,
inutterably
weary.
“Send
him.
Later.
I’ll
sleep
now.
Too
sick
to
fight.
Send
him
up
later,
the
Blackfish…”

Catelyn
kissed
him
gently,
smoothed
his
hair,
and
left
him
there
in
the
shade
of
his
keep,
with
his
rivers
flowing
beneath.
He
was
asleep
before
she
left
the
solar.

When
she
returned
to
the
lower
bailey,
Ser
Brynden
Tully
stood
on
the
water
stairs
with
wet
boots,
talking
with
the
captain
of
Riverrun’s
guards.
He
came
to
her
at
once.
“Is
he—”

“Dying,”
she
said.
“As
we
feared.”

Her
uncle’s
craggy
face
showed
his
pain
plain.
He
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
grey
hair.
“Will
he
see
me?”

She
nodded.
“He
says
he
is
too
sick
to
fight.”

Brynden
Blackfish
chuckled.
“I
am
too
old
a
soldier
to
believe
that.
Hoster
will
be
chiding
me
about
the
Redwyne
girl
even
as
we
light
his
funeral
pyre,
damn
his
bones.”

Catelyn
smiled,
knowing
it
was
true.
“I
do
not
see
Robb.”

“He
went
with
Greyjoy
to
the
hall,
I
believe.”

Theon
Greyjoy
was
seated
on
a
bench
in
Riverrun’s
Great
Hall,
enjoying
a
horn
of
ale
and
regaling
her
father’s
garrison
with
an
account
of
the
slaughter
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
“Some
tried
to
flee,
but
we’d
pinched
the
valley
shut
at
both
ends,
and
we
rode
out
of
the
darkness
with
sword
and
lance.
The
Lannisters
must
have
thought
the
Others
themselves
were
on
them
when
that
wolf
of
Robb’s
got
in
among
them.
I
saw
him
tear
one
man’s
arm
from
his
shoulder,
and
their
horses
went
mad
at
the
scent
of
him.
I
couldn’t
tell
you
how
many
men
were
thrown—”

“Theon,”
she
interrupted,
“where
might
I
find
my
son?”

“Lord
Robb
went
to
visit
the
godswood,
my
lady.”

It
was
what
Ned
would
have
done.
He
is
his
father’s
son
as
much
as
mine,
I
must
remember.
Oh,
gods,
Ned…

She
found
Robb
beneath
the
green
canopy
of
leaves,
surrounded
by
tall
redwoods
and
great
old
elms,
kneeling
before
the
heart
tree,
a
slender
weirwood
with
a
face
more
sad
than
fierce.
His
longsword
was
before
him,
the
point
thrust
in
the
earth,
his
gloved
hands
clasped
around
the
hilt.
Around
him
others
knelt:
Greatjon
Umber,
Rickard
Karstark,
Maege
Mormont,
Galbart
Glover,
and
more.
Even
Tytos
Blackwood
was
among
them,
the
great
raven
cloak
fanned
out
behind
him.
These
are
the
ones
who
keep
the
old
gods,
she
realized.
She
asked
herself
what
gods
she
kept
these
days,
and
could
not
find
an
answer.

It
would
not
do
to
disturb
them
at
their
prayers.
The
gods
must
have
their
due…
even
cruel
gods
who
would
take
Ned
from
her,
and
her
lord
father
as
well.
So
Catelyn
waited.
The
river
wind
moved
through
the
high
branches,
and
she
could
see
the
Wheel
Tower
to
her
right,
ivy
crawling
up
its
side.
As
she
stood
there,
all
the
memories
came
flooding
back
to
her.
Her
father
had
taught
her
to
ride
amongst
these
trees,
and
that
was
the
elm
that
Edmure
had
fallen
from
when
he
broke
his
arm,
and
over
there,
beneath
that
bower,
she
and
Lysa
had
played
at
kissing
with
Petyr.

She
had
not
thought
of
that
in
years.
How
young
they
all
had
been—she
no
older
than
Sansa,
Lysa
younger
than
Arya,
and
Petyr
younger
still,
yet
eager.
The
girls
had
traded
him
between
them,
serious
and
giggling
by
turns.
It
came
back
to
her
so
vividly
she
could
almost
feel
his
sweaty
fingers
on
her
shoulders
and
taste
the
mint
on
his
breath.
There
was
always
mint
growing
in
the
godswood,
and
Petyr
had
liked
to
chew
it.
He
had
been
such
a
bold
little
boy,
always
in
trouble.
“He
tried
to
put
his
tongue
in
my
mouth,”
Catelyn
had
confessed
to
her
sister
afterward,
when
they
were
alone.
“He
did
with
me
too,”
Lysa
had
whispered,
shy
and
breathless.
“I
liked
it.”

Robb
got
to
his
feet
slowly
and
sheathed
his
sword,
and
Catelyn
found
herself
wondering
whether
her
son
had
ever
kissed
a
girl
in
the
godswood.
Surely
he
must
have.
She
had
seen
Jeyne
Poole
giving
him
moist-eyed
glances,
and
some
of
the
serving
girls,
even
ones
as
old
as
eighteen…
he
had
ridden
in
battle
and
killed
men
with
a
sword,
surely
he
had
been
kissed.
There
were
tears
in
her
eyes.
She
wiped
them
away
angrily.

“Mother,”
Robb
said
when
he
saw
her
standing
there.
“We
must
call
a
council.
There
are
things
to
be
decided.”

“Your
grandfather
would
like
to
see
you,”
she
said.
“Robb,
he’s
very
sick.”

“Ser
Edmure
told
me.
I
am
sorry,
Mother…
for
Lord
Hoster
and
for
you.
Yet
first
we
must
meet.
We’ve
had
word
from
the
south.
Renly
Baratheon
has
claimed
his
brother’s
crown.”

“Renly?”
she
said,
shocked.
“I
had
thought,
surely
it
would
be
Lord
Stannis…”

“So
did
we
all,
my
lady,”
Galbart
Glover
said.

The
war
council
convened
in
the
Great
Hall,
at
four
long
trestle
tables
arranged
in
a
broken
square.
Lord
Hoster
was
too
weak
to
attend,
asleep
on
his
balcony,
dreaming
of
the
sun
on
the
rivers
of
his
youth.
Edmure
sat
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Tullys,
with
Brynden
Blackfish
at
his
side,
and
his
father’s
bannermen
arrayed
to
right
and
left
and
along
the
side
tables.
Word
of
the
victory
at
Riverrun
had
spread
to
the
fugitive
lords
of
the
Trident,
drawing
them
back.
Karyl
Vance
came
in,
a
lord
now,
his
father
dead
beneath
the
Golden
Tooth.
Ser
Marq
Piper
was
with
him,
and
they
brought
a
Darry,
Ser
Raymun’s
son,
a
lad
no
older
than
Bran.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
arrived
from
the
ruins
of
Stone
Hedge,
glowering
and
blustering,
and
took
a
seat
as
far
from
Tytos
Blackwood
as
the
tables
would
permit.

The
northern
lords
sat
opposite,
with
Catelyn
and
Robb
facing
her
brother
across
the
tables.
They
were
fewer.
The
Greatjon
sat
at
Robb’s
left
hand,
and
then
Theon
Greyjoy;
Galbart
Glover
and
Lady
Mormont
were
to
the
right
of
Catelyn.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark,
gaunt
and
hollow-eyed
in
his
grief,
took
his
seat
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare,
his
long
beard
uncombed
and
unwashed.
He
had
left
two
sons
dead
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
there
was
no
word
of
the
third,
his
eldest,
who
had
led
the
Karstark
spears
against
Tywin
Lannister
on
the
Green
Fork.

The
arguing
raged
on
late
into
the
night.
Each
lord
had
a
right
to
speak,
and
speak
they
did…
and
shout,
and
curse,
and
reason,
and
cajole,
and
jest,
and
bargain,
and
slam
tankards
on
the
table,
and
threaten,
and
walk
out,
and
return
sullen
or
smiling.
Catelyn
sat
and
listened
to
it
all.

Roose
Bolton
had
re-formed
the
battered
remnants
of
their
other
host
at
the
mouth
of
the
causeway.
Ser
Helman
Tallhart
and
Walder
Frey
still
held
the
Twins.
Lord
Tywin’s
army
had
crossed
the
Trident,
and
was
making
for
Harrenhal.
And
there
were
two
kings
in
the
realm.
Two
kings,
and
no
agreement.

Many
of
the
lords
bannermen
wanted
to
march
on
Harrenhal
at
once,
to
meet
Lord
Tywin
and
end
Lannister
power
for
all
time.
Young,
hot-tempered
Marq
Piper
urged
a
strike
west
at
Casterly
Rock
instead.
Still
others
counseled
patience.
Riverrun
sat
athwart
the
Lannister
supply
lines,
Jason
Mallister
pointed
out;
let
them
bide
their
time,
denying
Lord
Tywin
fresh
levies
and
provisions
while
they
strengthened
their
defenses
and
rested
their
weary
troops.
Lord
Blackwood
would
have
none
of
it.
They
should
finish
the
work
they
began
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
March
to
Harrenhal
and
bring
Roose
Bolton’s
army
down
as
well.
What
Blackwood
urged,
Bracken
opposed,
as
ever;
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
rose
to
insist
they
ought
pledge
their
fealty
to
King
Renly,
and
move
south
to
join
their
might
to
his.

“Renly
is
not
the
king,”
Robb
said.
It
was
the
first
time
her
son
had
spoken.
Like
his
father,
he
knew
how
to
listen.

“You
cannot
mean
to
hold
to
Joffrey,
my
lord,”
Galbart
Glover
said.
“He
put
your
father
to
death.”

“That
makes
him
evil,”
Robb
replied.
“I
do
not
know
that
it
makes
Renly
king.
Joffrey
is
still
Robert’s
eldest
trueborn
son,
so
the
throne
is
rightfully
his
by
all
the
laws
of
the
realm.
Were
he
to
die,
and
I
mean
to
see
that
he
does,
he
has
a
younger
brother.
Tommen
is
next
in
line
after
Joffrey.”

“Tommen
is
no
less
a
Lannister,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
snapped.

“As
you
say,”
said
Robb,
troubled.
“Yet
if
neither
one
is
king,
still,
how
could
it
be
Lord
Renly?
He’s
Robert’s
younger
brother.
Bran
can’t
be
Lord
of
Winterfell
before
me,
and
Renly
can’t
be
king
before
Lord
Stannis.”

Lady
Mormont
agreed.
“Lord
Stannis
has
the
better
claim.”

“Renly
is
crowned,”
said
Marq
Piper.
“Highgarden
and
Storm’s
End
support
his
claim,
and
the
Dornishmen
will
not
be
laggardly.
If
Winterfell
and
Riverrun
add
their
strength
to
his,
he
will
have
five
of
the
seven
great
houses
behind
him.
Six,
if
the
Arryns
bestir
themselves!
Six
against
the
Rock!
My
lords,
within
the
year,
we
will
have
all
their
heads
on
pikes,
the
queen
and
the
boy
king,
Lord
Tywin,
the
Imp,
the
Kingslayer,
Ser
Kevan,
all
of
them!
That
is
what
we
shall
win
if
we
join
with
King
Renly.
What
does
Lord
Stannis
have
against
that,
that
we
should
cast
it
all
aside?”

“The
right,”
said
Robb
stubbornly.
Catelyn
thought
he
sounded
eerily
like
his
father
as
he
said
it.

“So
you
mean
us
to
declare
for
Stannis?”
asked
Edmure.

“I
don’t
know,”
said
Robb.
“I
prayed
to
know
what
to
do,
but
the
gods
did
not
answer.
The
Lannisters
killed
my
father
for
a
traitor,
and
we
know
that
was
a
lie,
but
if
Joffrey
is
the
lawful
king
and
we
fight
against
him,
we
will
be
traitors.”

“My
lord
father
would
urge
caution,”
aged
Ser
Stevron
said,
with
the
weaselly
smile
of
a
Frey.
“Wait,
let
these
two
kings
play
their
game
of
thrones.
When
they
are
done
fighting,
we
can
bend
our
knees
to
the
victor,
or
oppose
him,
as
we
choose.
With
Renly
arming,
likely
Lord
Tywin
would
welcome
a
truce…
and
the
safe
return
of
his
son.
Noble
lords,
allow
me
to
go
to
him
at
Harrenhal
and
arrange
good
terms
and
ransoms…”

A
roar
of
outrage
drowned
out
his
voice.
“Craven!”
the
Greatjon
thundered.
“Begging
for
a
truce
will
make
us
seem
weak,”
declared
Lady
Mormont.
“Ransoms
be
damned,
we
must
not
give
up
the
Kingslayer,”
shouted
Rickard
Karstark.

“Why
not
a
peace?”
Catelyn
asked.

The
lords
looked
at
her,
but
it
was
Robb’s
eyes
she
felt,
his
and
his
alone.
“My
lady,
they
murdered
my
lord
father,
your
husband,”
he
said
grimly.
He
unsheathed
his
longsword
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
him,
the
bright
steel
on
the
rough
wood.
“This
is
the
only
peace
I
have
for
Lannisters.”

The
Greatjon
bellowed
his
approval,
and
other
men
added
their
voices,
shouting
and
drawing
swords
and
pounding
their
fists
on
the
table.
Catelyn
waited
until
they
had
quieted.
“My
lords,”
she
said
then,
“Lord
Eddard
was
your
liege,
but
I
shared
his
bed
and
bore
his
children.
Do
you
think
I
love
him
any
less
than
you?”
Her
voice
almost
broke
with
her
grief,
but
Catelyn
took
a
long
breath
and
steadied
herself.
“Robb,
if
that
sword
could
bring
him
back,
I
should
never
let
you
sheathe
it
until
Ned
stood
at
my
side
once
more…
but
he
is
gone,
and
hundred
Whispering
Woods
will
not
change
that.
Ned
is
gone,
and
Daryn
Hornwood,
and
Lord
Karstark’s
valiant
sons,
and
many
other
good
men
besides,
and
none
of
them
will
return
to
us.
Must
we
have
more
deaths
still?”

“You
are
a
woman,
my
lady,”
the
Greatjon
rumbled
in
his
deep
voice.
“Women
do
not
understand
these
things.”

“You
are
the
gentle
sex,”
said
Lord
Karstark,
with
the
lines
of
grief
fresh
on
his
face.
“A
man
has
a
need
for
vengeance.”

“Give
me
Cersei
Lannister,
Lord
Karstark,
and
you
would
see
how
gentle
a
woman
can
be,”
Catelyn
replied.
“Perhaps
I
do
not
understand
tactics
and
strategy…
but
I
understand
futility.
We
went
to
war
when
Lannister
armies
were
ravaging
the
riverlands,
and
Ned
was
a
prisoner,
falsely
accused
of
treason.
We
fought
to
defend
ourselves,
and
to
win
my
lord’s
freedom.

“Well,
the
one
is
done,
and
the
other
forever
beyond
our
reach.
I
will
mourn
for
Ned
until
the
end
of
my
days,
but
I
must
think
of
the
living.
I
want
my
daughters
back,
and
the
queen
holds
them
still.
If
I
must
trade
our
four
Lannisters
for
their
two
Starks,
I
will
call
that
a
bargain
and
thank
the
gods.
I
want
you
safe,
Robb,
ruling
at
Winterfell
from
your
father’s
seat.
I
want
you
to
live
your
life,
to
kiss
a
girl
and
wed
a
woman
and
father
a
son.
I
want
to
write
an
end
to
this.
I
want
to
go
home,
my
lords,
and
weep
for
my
husband.”

The
hall
was
very
quiet
when
Catelyn
finished
speaking.

“Peace,”
said
her
uncle
Brynden.
“Peace
is
sweet,
my
lady…
but
on
what
terms?
It
is
no
good
hammering
your
sword
into
a
plowshare
if
you
must
forge
it
again
on
the
morrow.”

“What
did
Torrhen
and
my
Eddard
die
for,
if
I
am
to
return
to
Karhold
with
nothing
but
their
bones?”
asked
Rickard
Karstark.

“Aye,”
said
Lord
Bracken.
“Gregor
Clegane
laid
waste
to
my
fields,
slaughtered
my
smallfolk,
and
left
Stone
Hedge
a
smoking
ruin.
Am
I
now
to
bend
the
knee
to
the
ones
who
sent
him?
What
have
we
fought
for,
if
we
are
to
put
all
back
as
it
was
before?”

Lord
Blackwood
agreed,
to
Catelyn’s
surprise
and
dismay.
“And
if
we
do
make
peace
with
King
Joffrey,
are
we
not
then
traitors
to
King
Renly?
What
if
the
stag
should
prevail
against
the
lion,
where
would
that
leave
us?”

“Whatever
you
may
decide
for
yourselves,
I
shall
never
call
a
Lannister
my
king,”
declared
Marq
Piper.

“Nor
I!”
yelled
the
little
Darry
boy.
“I
never
will!”

Again
the
shouting
began.
Catelyn
sat
despairing.
She
had
come
so
close,
she
thought.
They
had
almost
listened,
almost…
but
the
moment
was
gone.
There
would
be
no
peace,
no
chance
to
heal,
no
safety.
She
looked
at
her
son,
watched
him
as
he
listened
to
the
lords
debate,
frowning,
troubled,
yet
wedded
to
his
war.
He
had
pledged
himself
to
marry
a
daughter
of
Walder
Frey,
but
she
saw
his
true
bride
plain
before
her
now:
the
sword
he
had
laid
on
the
table.

Catelyn
was
thinking
of
her
girls,
wondering
if
she
would
ever
see
them
again,
when
the
Greatjon
lurched
to
his
feet.

“MY
LORDS!”
he
shouted,
his
voice
booming
off
the
rafters.
“Here
is
what
I
say
to
these
two
kings!”
He
spat.
“Renly
Baratheon
is
nothing
to
me,
nor
Stannis
neither.
Why
should
they
rule
over
me
and
mine,
from
some
flowery
seat
in
Highgarden
or
Dorne?
What
do
they
know
of
the
Wall
or
the
wolfswood
or
the
barrows
of
the
First
Men?
Even
their
gods
are
wrong.
The
Others
take
the
Lannisters
too,
I’ve
had
a
bellyful
of
them.”
He
reached
back
over
his
shoulder
and
drew
his
immense
two-handed
greatsword.
“Why
shouldn’t
we
rule
ourselves
again?
It
was
the
dragons
we
married,
and
the
dragons
are
all
dead!”
He
pointed
at
Robb
with
the
blade.
“There
sits
the
only
king
I
mean
to
bow
my
knee
to,
m’lords,”
he
thundered.
“The
King
in
the
North!”

And
he
knelt,
and
laid
his
sword
at
her
son’s
feet.

“I’ll
have
peace
on
those
terms,”
Lord
Karstark
said.
“They
can
keep
their
red
castle
and
their
iron
chair
as
well.”
He
eased
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.
“The
King
in
the
North!”
he
said,
kneeling
beside
the
Greatjon.

Maege
Mormont
stood.
“The
King
of
Winter!”
she
declared,
and
laid
her
spiked
mace
beside
the
swords.
And
the
river
lords
were
rising
too,
Blackwood
and
Bracken
and
Mallister,
houses
who
had
never
been
ruled
from
Winterfell,
yet
Catelyn
watched
them
rise
and
draw
their
blades,
bending
their
knees
and
shouting
the
old
words
that
had
not
been
heard
in
the
realm
for
more
than
three
hundred
years,
since
Aegon
the
Dragon
had
come
to
make
the
Seven
Kingdoms
one…
yet
now
were
heard
again,
ringing
from
the
timbers
of
her
father’s
hall:

“The
King
in
the
North!”

“The
King
in
the
North!”

“THE
KING
IN
THE
NORTH!”





DAENERYS

The
land
was
red
and
dead
and
parched,
and
good
wood
was
hard
to
come
by.
Her
foragers
returned
with
gnarled
cottonwoods,
purple
brush,
sheaves
of
brown
grass.
They
took
the
two
straightest
trees,
hacked
the
limbs
and
branches
from
them,
skinned
off
their
bark,
and
split
them,
laying
the
logs
in
a
square.
Its
center
they
filled
with
straw,
brush,
bark
shavings,
and
bundles
of
dry
grass.
Rakharo
chose
a
stallion
from
the
small
herd
that
remained
to
them;
he
was
not
the
equal
of
Khal
Drogo’s
red,
but
few
horses
were.
In
the
center
of
the
square,
Aggo
fed
him
a
withered
apple
and
dropped
him
in
an
instant
with
an
axe
blow
between
the
eyes.

Bound
hand
and
foot,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
watched
from
the
dust
with
disquiet
in
her
black
eyes.
“It
is
not
enough
to
kill
a
horse,”
she
told
Dany.
“By
itself,
the
blood
is
nothing.
You
do
not
have
the
words
to
make
a
spell,
nor
the
wisdom
to
find
them.
Do
you
think
bloodmagic
is
a
game
for
children?
You
call
me
maegi
as
if
it
were
a
curse,
but
all
it
means
is
wise.
You
are
a
child,
with
a
child’s
ignorance.
Whatever
you
mean
to
do,
it
will
not
work.
Loose
me
from
these
bonds
and
I
will
help
you.”

“I
am
tired
of
the
maegi’s
braying,”
Dany
told
Jhogo.
He
took
his
whip
to
her,
and
after
that
the
godswife
kept
silent.

Over
the
carcass
of
the
horse,
they
built
a
platform
of
hewn
logs;
trunks
of
smaller
trees
and
limbs
from
the
greater,
and
the
thickest
straightest
branches
they
could
find.
They
laid
the
wood
east
to
west,
from
sunrise
to
sunset.
On
the
platform
they
piled
Khal
Drogo’s
treasures:
his
great
tent,
his
painted
vests,
his
saddles
and
harness,
the
whip
his
father
had
given
him
when
he
came
to
manhood,
the
arakh
he
had
used
to
slay
Khal
Ogo
and
his
son,
a
mighty
dragonbone
bow.
Aggo
would
have
added
the
weapons
Drogo’s
bloodriders
had
given
Dany
for
bride
gifts
as
well,
but
she
forbade
it.
“Those
are
mine,”
she
told
him,
“and
I
mean
to
keep
them.”
Another
layer
of
brush
was
piled
about
the
khal’s
treasures,
and
bundles
of
dried
grass
scattered
over
them.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
drew
her
aside
as
the
sun
was
creeping
toward
its
zenith.
“Princess…”
he
began.

“Why
do
you
call
me
that?”
Dany
challenged
him.
“My
brother
Viserys
was
your
king,
was
he
not?”

“He
was,
my
lady.”

“Viserys
is
dead.
I
am
his
heir,
the
last
blood
of
House
Targaryen.
Whatever
was
his
is
mine
now.”

“My…
queen,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
going
to
one
knee.
“My
sword
that
was
his
is
yours,
Dacnerys.
And
my
heart
as
well,
that
never
belonged
to
your
brother.
I
am
only
a
knight,
and
I
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
exile,
but
I
beg
you,
hear
me.
Let
Khal
Drogo
go.
You
shall
not
be
alone.
I
promise
you,
no
man
shall
take
you
to
Vaes
Dothrak
unless
you
wish
to
go.
You
need
not
join
the
dosh
khaleen.
Come
east
with
me.
Yi
Ti,
Qarth,
the
Jade
Sea,
Asshai
by
the
Shadow.
We
will
see
all
the
wonders
yet
unseen,
and
drink
what
wines
the
gods
see
fit
to
serve
us.
Please,
Khaleesi.
I
know
what
you
intend.
Do
not.
Do
not.”

“I
must,”
Dany
told
him.
She
touched
his
face,
fondly,
sadly.
“You
do
not
understand.”

“I
understand
that
you
loved
him,”
Ser
Jorah
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
despair.
“I
loved
my
lady
wife
once,
yet
I
did
not
die
with
her.
You
are
my
queen,
my
sword
is
yours,
but
do
not
ask
me
to
stand
aside
as
you
climb
on
Drogo’s
pyre.
I
will
not
watch
you
burn.”

“Is
that
what
you
fear?”
Dany
kissed
him
lightly
on
his
broad
forehead.
“I
am
not
such
a
child
as
that,
sweet
ser.”

“You
do
not
mean
to
die
with
him?
You
swear
it,
my
queen?”

“I
swear
it,”
she
said
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
that
by
rights
were
hers.

The
third
level
of
the
platform
was
woven
of
branches
no
thicker
than
a
finger,
and
covered
with
dry
leaves
and
twigs.
They
laid
them
north
to
south,
from
ice
to
fire,
and
piled
them
high
with
soft
cushions
and
sleeping
silks.
The
sun
had
begun
to
lower
toward
the
west
by
the
time
they
were
done.
Dany
called
the
Dothraki
around
her.
Fewer
than
a
hundred
were
left.
How
many
had
Aegon
started
with?
she
wondered.
It
did
not
matter.

“You
will
be
my
khalasar,”
she
told
them.
“I
see
the
faces
of
slaves.
I
free
you.
Take
off
your
collars.
Go
if
you
wish,
no
one
shall
harm
you.
If
you
stay,
it
will
be
as
brothers
and
sisters,
husbands
and
wives.”
The
black
eyes
watched
her,
wary,
expressionless.
“I
see
the
children,
women,
the
wrinkled
faces
of
the
aged.
I
was
a
child
yesterday.
Today
I
am
a
woman.
Tomorrow
I
will
be
old.
To
each
of
you
I
say,
give
me
your
hands
and
your
hearts,
and
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
you.”
She
turned
to
the
three
young
warriors
of
her
khas.
“Jhogo,
to
you
I
give
the
silver-handled
whip
that
was
my
bride
gift,
and
name
you
ko,
and
ask
your
oath,
that
you
will
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

Jhogo
took
the
whip
from
her
hands,
but
his
face
was
confused.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said
hesitantly,
“this
is
not
done.
It
would
shame
me,
to
be
bloodrider
to
a
woman.”

“Aggo,”
Dany
called,
paying
no
heed
to
Jhogo’s
words.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“To
you
I
give
the
dragonbone
bow
that
was
my
bride
gift.”
It
was
double-curved,
shiny
black
and
exquisite,
taller
than
she
was.
“I
name
you
ko,
and
ask
your
oath,
that
you
should
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

Aggo
accepted
the
bow
with
lowered
eyes.
“I
cannot
say
these
words.
Only
a
man
can
lead
a
khalasar
or
name
a
ko.”

“Rakharo,”
Dany
said,
turning
away
from
the
refusal,
“you
shall
have
the
great
arakh
that
was
my
bride
gift,
with
hilt
and
blade
chased
in
gold.
And
you
too
I
name
my
ko,
and
ask
that
you
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

“You
are
khaleesi,”
Rakharo
said,
taking
the
arakh.
“I
shall
ride
at
your
side
to
Vaes
Dothrak
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
and
keep
you
safe
from
harm
until
you
take
your
place
with
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen.
No
more
can
I
promise.”

She
nodded,
as
calmly
as
if
she
had
not
heard
his
answer,
and
turned
to
the
last
of
her
champions.
“Ser
Jorah
Mormont,”
she
said,
“first
and
greatest
of
my
knights,
I
have
no
bride
gift
to
give
you,
but
I
swear
to
you,
one
day
you
shall
have
from
my
hands
a
longsword
like
none
the
world
has
ever
seen,
dragon-forged
and
made
of
Valyrian
steel.
And
I
would
ask
for
your
oath
as
well.”

“You
have
it,
my
queen,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
kneeling
to
lay
his
sword
at
her
feet.
“I
vow
to
serve
you,
to
obey
you,
to
die
for
you
if
need
be.”

“Whatever
may
come?”

“Whatever
may
come.”

“I
shall
hold
you
to
that
oath.
I
pray
you
never
regret
the
giving
of
it.”
Dany
lifted
him
to
his
feet.
Stretching
on
her
toes
to
reach
his
lips,
she
kissed
the
knight
gently
and
said,
“You
are
the
first
of
my
Queensguard.”

She
could
feel
the
eyes
of
the
khalasar
on
her
as
she
entered
her
tent.
The
Dothraki
were
muttering
and
giving
her
strange
sideways
looks
from
the
corners
of
their
dark
almond
eyes.
They
thought
her
mad,
Dany
realized.
Perhaps
she
was.
She
would
know
soon
enough.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.

Her
bath
was
scalding
hot
when
Irri
helped
her
into
the
tub,
but
Dany
did
not
flinch
or
cry
aloud.
She
liked
the
heat.
It
made
her
feel
clean.
Jhiqui
had
scented
the
water
with
the
oils
she
had
found
in
the
market
in
Vaes
Dothrak;
the
steam
rose
moist
and
fragrant.
Doreah
washed
her
hair
and
combed
it
out,
working
loose
the
mats
and
tangles.
Irri
scrubbed
her
back.
Dany
closed
her
eyes
and
let
the
smell
and
the
warmth
enfold
her.
She
could
feel
the
heat
soaking
through
the
soreness
between
her
thighs.
She
shuddered
when
it
entered
her,
and
her
pain
and
stiffness
seemed
to
dissolve.
She
floated.

When
she
was
clean,
her
handmaids
helped
her
from
the
water.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
fanned
her
dry,
while
Doreah
brushed
her
hair
until
it
fell
like
a
river
of
liquid
silver
down
her
back.
They
scented
her
with
spiceflower
and
cinnamon;
a
touch
on
each
wrist,
behind
her
ears,
on
the
tips
of
her
milk-heavy
breasts.
The
last
dab
was
for
her
sex.
Irri’s
finger
felt
as
light
and
cool
as
a
lover’s
kiss
as
it
slid
softly
up
between
her
lips.

Afterward,
Dany
sent
them
all
away,
so
she
might
prepare
Khal
Drogo
for
his
final
ride
into
the
night
lands.
She
washed
his
body
clean
and
brushed
and
oiled
his
hair,
running
her
fingers
through
it
for
the
last
time,
feeling
the
weight
of
it,
remembering
the
first
time
she
had
touched
it,
the
night
of
their
wedding
ride.
His
hair
had
never
been
cut.
How
many
men
could
die
with
their
hair
uncut?
She
buried
her
face
in
it
and
inhaled
the
dark
fragrance
of
the
oils.
He
smelled
like
grass
and
warm
earth,
like
smoke
and
semen
and
horses.
He
smelled
like
Drogo.
Forgive
me,
sun
of
my
life,
she
thought.
Forgive
me
for
all
I
have
done
and
all
I
must
do.
I
paid
the
price,
my
star,
but
it
was
too
high,
too
high…

Dany
braided
his
hair
and
slid
the
silver
rings
onto
his
mustache
and
hung
his
bells
one
by
one.
So
many
bells,
gold
and
silver
and
bronze.
Bells
so
his
enemies
would
hear
him
coming
and
grow
weak
with
fear.
She
dressed
him
in
horsehair
leggings
and
high
boots,
buckling
a
belt
heavy
with
gold
and
silver
medallions
about
his
waist.
Over
his
scarred
chest
she
slipped
a
painted
vest,
old
and
faded,
the
one
Drogo
had
loved
best.
For
herself
she
chose
loose
sandsilk
trousers,
sandals
that
laced
halfway
up
her
legs,
and
a
vest
like
Drogo’s.

The
sun
was
going
down
when
she
called
them
back
to
carry
his
body
to
the
pyre.
The
Dothraki
watched
in
silence
as
Jhogo
and
Aggo
bore
him
from
the
tent.
Dany
walked
behind
them.
They
laid
him
down
on
his
cushions
and
silks,
his
head
toward
the
Mother
of
Mountains
far
to
the
northeast.

“Oil,”
she
commanded,
and
they
brought
forth
the
jars
and
poured
them
over
the
pyre,
soaking
the
silks
and
the
brush
and
the
bundles
of
dry
grass,
until
the
oil
trickled
from
beneath
the
logs
and
the
air
was
rich
with
fragrance.
“Bring
my
eggs,”
Dany
commanded
her
handmaids.
Something
in
her
voice
made
them
run.

Ser
Jorah
took
her
arm.
“My
queen,
Drogo
will
have
no
use
for
dragon’s
eggs
in
the
night
lands.
Better
to
sell
them
in
Asshai.
Sell
one
and
we
can
buy
a
ship
to
take
us
back
to
the
Free
Cities.
Sell
all
three
and
you
will
be
a
wealthy
woman
all
your
days.”

“They
were
not
given
to
me
to
sell,”
Dany
told
him.

She
climbed
the
pyre
herself
to
place
the
eggs
around
her
sun-and-stars.
The
black
beside
his
heart,
under
his
arm.
The
green
beside
his
head,
his
braid
coiled
around
it.
The
cream-and-gold
down
between
his
legs.
When
she
kissed
him
for
the
last
time,
Dany
could
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
oil
on
his
lips.

As
she
climbed
down
off
the
pyre,
she
noticed
Mirri
Maz
Duur
watching
her.
“You
are
mad,”
the
godswife
said
hoarsely.

“Is
it
so
far
from
madness
to
wisdom?”
Dany
asked.
“Ser
Jorah,
take
this
maegi
and
bind
her
to
the
pyre.”

“To
the…
my
queen,
no,
hear
me…”

“Do
as
I
say.”
Still
he
hesitated,
until
her
anger
flared.
“You
swore
to
obey
me,
whatever
might
come.
Rakharo,
help
him.”

The
godswife
did
not
cry
out
as
they
dragged
her
to
Khal
Drogo’s
pyre
and
staked
her
down
amidst
his
treasures.
Dany
poured
the
oil
over
the
woman’s
head
herself.
“I
thank
you,
Mirri
Maz
Duur,”
she
said,
“for
the
lessons
you
have
taught
me.”

“You
will
not
hear
me
scream,”
Mirri
responded
as
the
oil
dripped
from
her
hair
and
soaked
her
clothing.

“I
will,”
Dany
said,
“but
it
is
not
your
screams
I
want,
only
your
life.
I
remember
what
you
told
me.
Only
death
can
pay
for
life.”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
opened
her
mouth,
but
made
no
reply.
As
she
stepped
away,
Dany
saw
that
the
contempt
was
gone
from
the
maegi’s
flat
black
eyes;
in
its
place
was
something
that
might
have
been
fear.
Then
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
watch
the
sun
and
look
for
the
first
star.

When
a
horselord
dies,
his
horse
is
slain
with
him,
so
he
might
ride
proud
into
the
night
lands.
The
bodies
are
burned
beneath
the
open
sky,
and
the
khal
rises
on
his
fiery
steed
to
take
his
place
among
the
stars.
The
more
fiercely
the
man
burned
in
life,
the
brighter
his
star
will
shine
in
the
darkness.

Jhogo
spied
it
first.
“There,”
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice.
Dany
looked
and
saw
it,
low
in
the
east.
The
first
star
was
a
comet,
burning
red.
Bloodred;
fire
red;
the
dragon’s
tail.
She
could
not
have
asked
for
a
stronger
sign.

Dany
took
the
torch
from
Aggo’s
hand
and
thrust
it
between
the
logs.
The
oil
took
the
fire
at
once,
the
brush
and
dried
grass
a
heartbeat
later.
Tiny
flames
went
darting
up
the
wood
like
swift
red
mice,
skating
over
the
oil
and
leaping
from
bark
to
branch
to
leaf.
A
rising
heat
puffed
at
her
face,
soft
and
sudden
as
a
lover’s
breath,
but
in
seconds
it
had
grown
too
hot
to
bear.
Dany
stepped
backward.
The
wood
crackled,
louder
and
louder.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
began
to
sing
in
a
shrill,
ululating
voice.
The
flames
whirled
and
writhed,
racing
each
other
up
the
platform.
The
dusk
shimmered
as
the
air
itself
seemed
to
liquefy
from
the
heat.
Dany
heard
logs
spit
and
crack.
The
fires
swept
over
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
Her
song
grew
louder,
shriller…
then
she
gasped,
again
and
again,
and
her
song
became
a
shuddering
wail,
thin
and
high
and
full
of
agony.

And
now
the
flames
reached
her
Drogo,
and
now
they
were
all
around
him.
His
clothing
took
fire,
and
for
an
instant
the
khal
was
clad
in
wisps
of
floating
orange
silk
and
tendrils
of
curling
smoke,
grey
and
greasy.
Dany’s
lips
parted
and
she
found
herself
holding
her
breath.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
go
to
him
as
Ser
Jorah
had
feared,
to
rush
into
the
flames
to
beg
for
his
forgiveness
and
take
him
inside
her
one
last
time,
the
fire
melting
the
flesh
from
their
bones
until
they
were
as
one,
forever.

She
could
smell
the
odor
of
burning
flesh,
no
different
than
horseflesh
roasting
in
a
firepit.
The
pyre
roared
in
the
deepening
dusk
like
some
great
beast,
drowning
out
the
fainter
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
screaming
and
sending
up
long
tongues
of
flame
to
lick
at
the
belly
of
the
night.
As
the
smoke
grew
thicker,
the
Dothraki
backed
away,
coughing.
Huge
orange
gouts
of
fire
unfurled
their
banners
in
that
hellish
wind,
the
logs
hissing
and
cracking,
glowing
cinders
rising
on
the
smoke
to
float
away
into
the
dark
like
so
many
newborn
fireflies.
The
heat
beat
at
the
air
with
great
red
wings,
driving
the
Dothraki
back,
driving
off
even
Mormont,
but
Dany
stood
her
ground.
She
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
and
the
fire
was
in
her.

She
had
sensed
the
truth
of
it
long
ago,
Dany
thought
as
she
took
a
step
closer
to
the
conflagration,
but
the
brazier
had
not
been
hot
enough.
The
flames
writhed
before
her
like
the
women
who
had
danced
at
her
wedding,
whirling
and
singing
and
spinning
their
yellow
and
orange
and
crimson
veils,
fearsome
to
behold,
yet
lovely,
so
lovely,
alive
with
heat.
Dany
opened
her
arms
to
them,
her
skin
flushed
and
glowing.
This
is
a
wedding,
too,
she
thought.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
fallen
silent.
The
godswife
thought
her
a
child,
but
children
grow,
and
children
learn.

Another
step,
and
Dany
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
sand
on
the
soles
of
her
feet,
even
through
her
sandals.
Sweat
ran
down
her
thighs
and
between
her
breasts
and
in
rivulets
over
her
cheeks,
where
tears
had
once
run.
Ser
Jorah
was
shouting
behind
her,
but
he
did
not
matter
anymore,
only
the
fire
mattered.
The
flames
were
so
beautiful,
the
loveliest
things
she
had
ever
seen,
each
one
a
sorcerer
robed
in
yellow
and
orange
and
scarlet,
swirling
long
smoky
cloaks.
She
saw
crimson
firelions
and
great
yellow
serpents
and
unicorns
made
of
pale
blue
flame;
she
saw
fish
and
foxes
and
monsters,
wolves
and
bright
birds
and
flowering
trees,
each
more
beautiful
than
the
last.
She
saw
a
horse,
a
great
grey
stallion
limned
in
smoke,
its
flowing
mane
a
nimbus
of
blue
flame.
Yes,
my
love,
my
sun-and-stars,
yes,
mount
now,
ride
now.

Her
vest
had
begun
to
smolder,
so
Dany
shrugged
it
off
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
painted
leather
burst
into
sudden
flame
as
she
skipped
closer
to
the
fire,
her
breasts
bare
to
the
blaze,
streams
of
milk
flowing
from
her
red
and
swollen
nipples.
Now,
she
thought,
now,
and
for
an
instant
she
glimpsed
Khal
Drogo
before
her,
mounted
on
his
smoky
stallion,
a
flaming
lash
in
his
hand.
He
smiled,
and
the
whip
snaked
down
at
the
pyre,
hissing.

She
heard
a
crack,
the
sound
of
shattering
stone.
The
platform
of
wood
and
brush
and
grass
began
to
shift
and
collapse
in
upon
itself.
Bits
of
burning
wood
slid
down
at
her,
and
Dany
was
showered
with
ash
and
cinders.
And
something
else
came
crashing
down,
bouncing
and
rolling,
to
land
at
her
feet;
a
chunk
of
curved
rock,
pale
and
veined
with
gold,
broken
and
smoking.
The
roaring
filled
the
world,
yet
dimly
through
the
firefall
Dany
heard
women
shriek
and
children
cry
out
in
wonder.

Only
death
can
pay
for
life.

And
there
came
a
second
crack,
loud
and
sharp
as
thunder,
and
the
smoke
stirred
and
whirled
around
her
and
the
pyre
shifted,
the
logs
exploding
as
the
fire
touched
their
secret
hearts.
She
heard
the
screams
of
frightened
horses,
and
the
voices
of
the
Dothraki
raised
in
shouts
of
fear
and
terror,
and
Ser
Jorah
calling
her
name
and
cursing.
No,
she
wanted
to
shout
to
him,
no,
my
good
knight,
do
not
fear
for
me.
The
fire
is
mine.
I
am
Daenerys
Stormborn,
daughter
of
dragons,
bride
of
dragons,
mother
of
dragons,
don’t
you
see?
Don’t
you
SEE?
With
a
belch
of
flame
and
smoke
that
reached
thirty
feet
into
the
sky,
the
pyre
collapsed
and
came
down
around
her.
Unafraid,
Dany
stepped
forward
into
the
firestorm,
calling
to
her
children.

The
third
crack
was
as
loud
and
sharp
as
the
breaking
of
the
world.

When
the
fire
died
at
last
and
the
ground
became
cool
enough
to
walk
upon,
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
found
her
amidst
the
ashes,
surrounded
by
blackened
logs
and
bits
of
glowing
ember
and
the
burnt
bones
of
man
and
woman
and
stallion.
She
was
naked,
covered
with
soot,
her
clothes
turned
to
ash,
her
beautiful
hair
all
crisped
away…
yet
she
was
unhurt.

The
cream-and-gold
dragon
was
suckling
at
her
left
breast,
the
green-and-bronze
at
the
right.
Her
arms
cradled
them
close.
The
black-and-scarlet
beast
was
draped
across
her
shoulders,
its
long
sinuous
neck
coiled
under
her
chin.
When
it
saw
Jorah,
it
raised
its
head
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
as
red
as
coals.

Wordless,
the
knight
fell
to
his
knees.
The
men
of
her
khas
came
up
behind
him.
Jhogo
was
the
first
to
lay
his
arakh
at
her
feet.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
he
murmured,
pushing
his
face
to
the
smoking
earth.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
she
heard
Aggo
echo.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Rakharo
shouted.

And
after
them
came
her
handmaids,
and
then
the
others,
all
the
Dothraki,
men
and
women
and
children,
and
Dany
had
only
to
look
at
their
eyes
to
know
that
they
were
hers
now,
today
and
tomorrow
and
forever,
hers
as
they
had
never
been
Drogo’s.

As
Daenerys
Targaryen
rose
to
her
feet,
her
black
hissed,
pale
smoke
venting
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils.
The
other
two
pulled
away
from
her
breasts
and
added
their
voices
to
the
call,
translucent
wings
unfolding
and
stirring
the
air,
and
for
the
first
time
in
hundreds
of
years,
the
night
came
alive
with
the
music
of
dragons.

Its

Orys

Aegon

brother.
Orys
rose
through

ranks

commanders.
When
he
defeated
and
slew
Argilac
the
Arrogant,
the
last
Storm
King,
Aegon
rewarded
him
with
Argilac’s
castle,
lands,
and
daughter.
Orys
took
the

and
adopted
the
banner,

Powerful,

and
numerous,
the

are

Tully,
their
swords
sworn

of
Riverrun,

they
have
not

When
Robert

on

Trident,
the

did
not
arrive
until
the

thereafter
Lord
Hoster
Tully
always
called
Lord
Walder
“the
Late

Frey.”
Lord
Frey
agreed

agreed

Walder

HOUSE
TULLY

The
Tullys
never
reigned
as
kings,
though
they
held
rich
lands
and
the
great
castle
at
Riverrun
for
a
thousand
years.
During
the
Wars
of
Conquest,
the
riverlands
belonged
to
Harren
the
Black,
King
of
the
Isles.
Harren’s
grandfather,
King
Harwyn
Hardhand,
had
taken
the
Trident
from
Arrec
the
Storm
King,
whose
ancestors
had
conquered
all
the
way
to
the
Neck
three
hundred
years
earlier,
slaying
the
last
of
the
old
River
Kings.
A
vain
and
bloody
tyrant,
Harren
the
Black
was
little
loved
by
those
he
ruled,
and
many
of
the
river
lords
deserted
him
to
join
Aegon’s
army.
First
among
those
was
Edmyn
Tully
of
Riverrun.
When
Harren
and
his
line
perished
in
the
burning
of
Harrenhal,
Aegon
rewarded
House
Tully
by
raising
Lord
Edmyn
to
dominion
over
the
lands
of
the
Trident
and
requiring
the
other
river
lords
to
swear
him
fealty.
The
Tully
sigil
is
a
leaping
trout,
silver,
on
a
field
of
rippling
blue
and
red.
The
Tully
words
are
Family,
Duty,
Honor.

HOUSE
GREYJOY

The
Greyjoys
of
Pyke
claim
descent
from
the
Grey
King
of
the
Age
of
Heroes.
Legend
says
the
Grey
King
ruled
not
only
the
western
isles
but
the
sea
itself,
and
took
a
mermaid
to
wife.



For
thousands
of
years,
raiders
from
the
Iron
Islands—called
“ironmen”
by
those
they
plundered—were
the
terrors
of
the
seas,
sailing
as
far
as
the
Port
of
Ibben
and
the
Summer
Isles.
They
prided
themselves
on
their
fierceness
in
battle
and
their
sacred
freedoms.
Each
island
had
its
own
“salt
king”
and
“rock
king.”
The
High
King
of
the
Isles
was
chosen
from
among
their
number,
until
King
Urron
made
the
throne
hereditary
by
murdering
the
other
kings
when
they
assembled
for
a
choosing.
Urron’s
own
line
was
extinguished
a
thousand
years
later
when
the
Andals
swept
over
the
islands.
The
Greyjoys,
like
other
island
lords,
intermarried
with
the
conquerors.



The
Iron
Kings
extended
their
rule
far
beyond
the
isles
themselves,
carving
kingdoms
out
of
the
mainland
with
fire
and
sword.
King
Qhored
could
truthfully
boast
that
his
writ
ran
“wherever
men
can
smell
salt
water
or
hear
the
crash
of
waves.”
In
later
centuries,
Qhored’s
descendants
lost
the
Arbor,
Oldtown,
Bear
Island,
and
much
of
the
western
shore.
Still,
come
the
Wars
of
Conquest,
King
Harren
the
Black
ruled
all
the
lands
between
the
mountains,
from
the
Neck
to
the
Blackwater
Rush.
When
Harren
and
his
sons
perished
in
the
fall
of
Harrenhal,
Aegon
Targaryen
granted
the
riverlands
to
House
Tully,
and
allowed
the
surviving
lords
of
the
Iron
Islands
to
revive
their
ancient
custom
and
choose
who
should
have
the
primacy
among
them.
They
chose
Lord
Vickon
Greyjoy
of
Pyke.

HOUSE
MARTELL

Dorne
was
the
last
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
swear
fealty
to
the
Iron
Throne.
Blood,
custom,
and
history
all
set
the
Dornishmen
apart
from
the
other
kingdoms.
When
the
war
of
succession
broke
out,
the
Prince
of
Dorne
kept
his
silence
and
took
no
part.



=======
MARTELL

Nymeria,
the
warrior
queen
of
the
Rhoyne,
brought
her
ten
thousand
ships
to
land
in
Dorne,
the
southernmost
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
took
Lord
Mors
Martell
to
husband.
With
her
help,
he
vanquished
his
rivals
to
rule
all
Dorne.
The
Rhoynar
influence
remains
strong.
Thus
Dornish
rulers
style
themselves
“Prince”
rather
than
“King.”
Under
Dornish
law,
lands
and
titles
pass
to
the
eldest
child,
not
the
eldest
male.
Dorne,
alone
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
was
never
conquered
by
Aegon
the
Dragon.
It
was
not
permanently
joined
to
the
realm
until
two
hundred
years
later,
and
then
by
marriage
and
treaty,
not
the
sword.
Peaceable
King
Daeron
II
succeeded
where
the
warriors
had
failed
by
wedding
the
Dornish
princess
Myriah
and
giving
his
own
sister
in
marriage
to
the
reigning
Prince
of
Dorne.

THE
OLD
DYNASTY

HOUSE
TARGARYEN

The
Targaryens
are
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
descended
from
the
high
lords
of
the
ancient
Freehold
of
Valyria,
their
heritage
proclaimed
in
a
striking
(some
say
inhuman)
beauty,
with
lilac
or
indigo
or
violet
eyes
and
hair
of
silver-gold
or
platinum
white.



Aegon
the
Dragon’s
ancestors
escaped
the
Doom
of
Valyria
and
the
chaos
and
slaughter
that
followed
to
settle
on
Dragonstone,
a
rocky
island
in
the
narrow
sea.
It
was
from
there
that
Aegon
and
his
sisters
sailed
to
conquer
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
To
preserve
the
blood
royal
and
keep
it
pure,
House
Targaryen
has
often
followed
the
Valyrian
custom
of
wedding
brother
to
sister.
Aegon
himself
took
both
his
sisters
to
wife,
and
fathered
sons
on
each.
The
Targaryen
banner
is
a
three-headed
dragon,
red
on
black,
the
three
heads
representing
Aegon
and
his
sisters.
The
Targaryen
words
are
Fire
and
Blood.
