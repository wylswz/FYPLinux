articles judith light joe gebbia and more on mistakes              after i had finished who   s the boss   my manager came up with an idea for a tv series for me  so we did seven episodes  but it didn   t go beyond that  i was also doing movies  but eventually things just sort of stopped  my manager told me that i needed to go back to the theater  here comes along this wonderful play about   you   re going to laugh   an aging sitcom star  he said it was perfect for me  i had started in the theater  but i was scared  i didn   t think i had the chops  i went to a yoga camp and meditated and finally called him  but by that point they had already cast it  so i told myself     the next thing that comes up  i   ll go for it     it was this play  wit  i had to shave my head and get naked onstage   i could have done a play with my clothes on  but it changed my life  i had to face the critics  i had dragged my feet because i was afraid of making a mistake  but what came out of it enabled me to learn something valuable       light stars in the amazon series transparent    i   m from los angeles  when i was young  i hung out with gangsters  my mom lived in a crip neighborhood  and my dad lived in a blood neighborhood  i used to walk from one neighborhood to the other every day  i had a friend who was a blood  but he went to a crip school  he wanted me to walk with him because i knew both crips and bloods  he had a gun that he used to keep  we would play street fighter and then walk to inglewood  that was a mistake that i used to make daily  i wish i could have slapped myself on the back of my head and said     what are you doing     but it was a mentality  living in that part of the city didn   t affect me  i didn   t let it scare me  i was fortunate  though  in that those mistakes didn   t end up hitting me too hard  you learn quite a lot from your mistakes  especially those that you make coming from a good place       washington is a jazz musician    arrogance is a mistake that many people make when they   re younger  i went to princeton and graduated summa cum laude   i thought i   d be one of those    year old hot young things with a book deal  but my first job out of college was as an education reporter at this small daily paper in central pennsylvania  part of my job was typing the lunch menus for five school districts  every monday  i   d be typing     hot dog in bun  milk     i was so mad   i wanted desperately to be in new york city working at a magazine  but  honest to god  it taught me humility  i was in a different part of the country outside of my comfort zone  i had to find stories to tell  i couldn   t be snotty about who i thought was interesting and who wasn   t  in retrospect  i   m so glad that i was    and not    when my first book came out  because i would not have handled it well       weiner is a novelist whose memoir  hungry heart  is out this month    i was born in seoul in       before the war  my father had worked at a trade firm  and i thought that after university i might go into banking or work at a trade firm  but when i took the entrance exam for prospective economics and law majors at the university of tokyo  i failed  the following year  i decided instead to try the entrance exam for science and engineering majors   i passed  i wanted to become an engineer after graduation but my academic results were poor  which led me toward an architecture course with mr  kenzo tange  it was an inspiring experience   he was working on the yoyogi national gymnasium project at the time  i cannot imagine how my life would have turned out had i not encountered academic failure  life can change its course at many small yet critical points  even if one thinks they have failed  that failure may open up another path for that person   s life       ito is an architect    i genuinely don   t believe that mistakes are truly mistakes   i know  it   s very      and crunchy  but anything that i   ve perceived to be a mistake has invariably  at some point down the line  given rise to something else wonderful  i made a movie that was a very difficult experience for everybody  cast and crew  it was nine months in    million gallons of water   it wasn   t fun  the movie didn   t do well  it didn   t further my career  it didn   t do all the things it was supposed to do  but i couldn   t call it a mistake  because so many good things came out of it  i met people during filming whom i   m still friends with today  you have to be aware of the alchemy of life  i think we   re too harsh with ourselves about what we consider to be mistakes  the only mistake is looking at your life myopically and not appreciating the vastness of experience       driver is an actress who stars in the new abc series speechless    the fear of mistakes is the fast track to irrelevance  of course airbnb made mistakes the first year  some came from our own preconceptions  when we started  we designed our interface for ourselves  internet savvy twentysomethings  we never considered the role of good eyesight in our interface   font size  vernacular  it all matters  the fastest growing group of airbnb hosts in the united states is seniors  the second fastest growing group is people in their   s  so we learned our lesson  on a recent mother   s day we invited our moms to visit the company  and we encouraged them to use the website in front of us  we were able to witness firsthand if something didn   t work for them  but it   s important to remember that the failure itself is not an event  it   s the relationship that you choose to have with an event   how you react to it   that matters       gebbia is co founder and chief product officer of airbnb
