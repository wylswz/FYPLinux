 have learned  the glare of wall street certainly adds pressure to any fledgling digital advertising business  those challenges might be heading the way of snap inc  ceo evan spiegel as the wall street journal reported  snap inc   the parent of snapchat  is working on an initial public offering that could take place as early as late march at a valuation of     billion or more with that long rumored event potentially on the horizon  snapchat has been attempting to ramp up its capabilities to perform the kind of digital ad targeting brands have come to expect from digital platforms  all the while maintaining mr  spiegel   s well documented desire to not become    creepy    for consumers investors in the public markets would potentially be looking for snap inc  to pull any lever to drive ad revenue growth  creepy or otherwise  of course  the best lever is simply to add more users  snapchat  which boasts     million daily active users  will have to meet wall street   s expectations that hot social platforms keep growing and growing just ask twitter  its stock has been punished quarter after quarter as investors saw anemic user growth  the company also suffered miscues on specific ad products     for example  the effectiveness of its direct response ads were blamed for a bad quarter last year  facebook learned its own lessons  in the run up to its infamous ipo  facebook announced a revenue decline and marketers openly wondered if advertising on the site actually drove sales  but let   s not get ahead of ourselves  here are the big advertising questions hanging over snap inc  as it weighs an ipo  how is snapchat   s approach to advertising evolving  up until recently  brands advertising on snapchat were targeting consumers based on age or gender  and marketers wanted more than those fairly rudimentary categories  last month  snapchat rolled out three new targeting options  such as a feature where marketers can take their existing list of email addresses and anonymously match that with snapchat   s own data  marketers can also push ads to people who watch certain types of videos  like sports that kind of targeting is commonplace elsewhere on the internet  but it marked a big step for snapchat  more recently  as recode reported  snapchat launched its new advertising application program interface  or api  joining platforms like facebook and twitter in allowing third parties to sell snapchat ads  that should in theory help accelerate its advertising business by allowing ads to be sold in a more automated fashion  can snapchat pull in tv dollars  with web video consumption surging and young people cutting the cable tv cord  companies like facebook and youtube are vying for tv ad dollars  snapchat is no exception  earlier this year  the company signed an advertising sales deal with tv giant  viacom

   and then took things a step further by hiring viacom   s ad sales chief  jeff lucas to head up global sales mr  lucas  a veteran of television   s annual    upfront    ad sales marketplace  has deep relationships with the kinds of big brand marketers from which snapchat wants to secure large commitments  his task will be to set up the kind of sales operation that enables snapchat to do so  can snapchat measure up  advertisers are hypersensitive to the measurement issue in digital media these days  most recently evidenced by the uproar after facebook apologized for overestimating a key video metric for two years  in short  marketers want third party proof that people are actually watching their ads     and then buying their products     and a platform   s word just isn   t good enough for its part  snapchat has hired top measurement executives  and signed measurement deals with companies like nielsen and moat so marketers can independently verify their campaigns  but whether snapchat can distinguish its measurement chops from other companies largely remains to be seen  write to steven perlberg at steven perlberg wsj com
