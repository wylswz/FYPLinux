          the buzz index uses an analytics model that deploys artificial intelligence and algorithms intended to understand the tone of a conversation   even including sarcasm  the index is reset every month  and a company must have a market cap of at least    billion to be included  though the stocks being talked about online tend to belong to the largest companies anyway  says  jamie wise  the founder of buzz indexes buz   s managers won   t intervene  even if a stock appears in the index that they don   t personally rate    that collective group decision making is better than any one individual   s ability to pick a stock  and so we   re not going to insert ourselves on top of that process     says mr  wise the use of social media data to inform investments is part of a broader trend toward exploiting big data  or very large sets of information that can be used to identify patterns or trends   blackrock inc

   s scientific active equity team uses big data analysis in a number of its funds  says  jeff shen  co head of investments in the sae group and the head of emerging markets at the company  for example  individual investors dominate the chinese stock market  and it can be difficult to figure out what they are thinking about  he says  the sae group gathers information from the most popular social media sites in the country in a bid to gain insight into a market that has been historically difficult to gauge    when there are a lot of people talking about one particular stock  it will probably give you a sense of the retail attention in that particular name or particular sector     says mr  shen other funds seek to gather data directly   crowdinvest wisdom etf  wize  tracks an index of    stocks that are selected every month based on data gathered from an ios app  it can be thought of as tinder  a location based dating app  for investing  says crowdinvest chief executive  annie wyatt  users rate stocks as bullish or bearish  and the most favored stocks are placed into the index the app is based on    wisdom of the crowd    theory  ms  wyatt and her colleagues place no restrictions on who can download the app and vote  meaning a newcomer will be given the same power as an experienced long term investor  the idea is that the group beats the wisdom of an individual    we want to make sure that people from all walks of life are coming into the app and voting and expressing their opinions  and we don   t ask for any reason why they   re expressing these opinions     she says the potential of all that data is one of the attractions for investors when it comes to social media companies themselves  says  jay jacobs  director of research at global x  whose  social media index etf  socl  tracks the performance of the solactive social media total return index    there are a lot of different uses for that data  and it is a big component of revenues for these companies  so it should not be overlooked as an area of growth     he says   purefunds ise big data etf  bigd  aims to track the companies that are mining and analyzing the data  the fund was launched in july       with the aim of tapping into the growing industry  say purefunds ceo  andrew chanin    i think people are going to become aware of how big this industry is     if you   re watching the financial news  it is tough to go an hour without hearing companies promoting their big data solutions or analysts talking about the space or companies in the space     he says still  the use of social media data and big data more broadly has its critics  while social media can be an important source of information and can capture trends in the market  it will prompt most serious investors to carry out their own research  rather than relying on it directly for making an investment decision  says  neena mishra  director of etf research at zacks investment research    i don   t think these can supplant the human analyst  at least not in the near term     she says     true  machines can process and analyze data much quicker compared with humans  but the challenge lies in deciding the importance of each piece of information in the investment decision      kiril nikolaev  a financial analyst at etfdb com  also believes that while big data analysis is increasingly important  it has potential drawbacks  for example  if everyone starts using the same or similar models to analyze information  the advantage will soon be    crowded out     he says  mr  cowan is a writer in london  he can be reached at reports wsj com
