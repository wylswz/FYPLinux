you   re going to own a virtual reality headset one day yes  you   re going to put those funny looking goggles on your face and your eyes won   t be rolling at me like they are right now i   ve been there  my interest in gaming stops at monopoly  the promise of virtual reality meant little more to me than a funny photo opp  but the buzz  it   s the future  they say  so i went on a journey to find virtual reality   s practical uses you can take a class of fifth graders across the world without needing permission slips  you can inspect the countertops in that dream house you   ve been eyeing  you can feel your heart pound as you practice your big speech in front of a room of people who aren   t actually there it   s hard to believe how powerful it is until you   ve put on the headset and replaced your current reality  with that in mind  i created a     degree video  it   s best viewed with vr goggles  or at least google   s cheap cardboard phone holder   we   ll get to that  by visiting places in the real world that i   d already seen in vr  i came to realize that these silly headsets can be magical  they also have a dark side  it   s easy to end up nauseous  and   more frighteningly   virtual experiences can sometimes get too real  more often than i imagined  the line between the two realities starts to blur i   m walking into the master bath of a     m penthouse that just hit the market  the blue tub that backs up to a stunning view of downtown san francisco is perfect  while examining the square showerhead  i feel something i never have before  a newfangled sort of d  j   vu  though my physical body has never been here  i remember it  in my office just two days ago  i was staring at the same brass spigot  via a vr headset the first person you try vr with could be a realtor rather than a

       gear vr headset in his car     i   ve locked in showings just after having a client put on the headset     he says  sales gimmick or no  when i set foot in that house  i knew exactly how to get to that bathroom  virtual tours are made by capturing   d images using a        camera and special software sold by a startup called matterport  you can click around an interactive model on a website  but it   s nothing like viewing it in matterport   s gear vr app  where you can tilt your head up to inspect the molding  then down to appreciate the stair runner   here   s the exact matterport model of the house i visited  though the images are still  you can move from one point to another  just stare for a second at the spot you want to go to  sound convenient  it   s like being thrown onto a fast moving train  in vr  when roaming from room to room  i needed dramamine  in the real house  i just wanted chardonnay i   m in a real classroom full of real fifth graders   though not for long  we all raise our google cardboard smartphone holders to our faces and behold the great sphinx     now look over there to the left     the teacher robin says to us     remember we read about mastabas    we were on a google expedition  where the company provides android phones  cardboard holders and     degree photos to classrooms  using a tablet  teachers guide and point out what students should focus on   should being the key word     do you see that car down there     one child yelled     they didn   t have cars in ancient egypt     replied another after their egyptian tour  students were more engaged with the teacher   s questions and each other  the biggest lesson  while virtual reality runs a real risk of isolating us more  it can also connect people in a clever new way much of the expedition proceeds without headsets on  however  partly  that   s to ensure the teacher can maintain students    focus  it   s also out of caution for children   s use of vr  makers of some systems  such as 





          sony



       and oculus  dissuade users under    or     google says children should be over   and have adult supervision looking at the comfort and engagement  it   s easy to imagine students eventually attending class inside their headsets  but before anyone young or old can go in for longer hauls  the experience has to be gentler on our equilibriums for the most sensitive  even relatively passive vr experiences can bring on nausea  a few of my young friends mentioned feeling dizzy  even though google   s images weren   t moving  children might have trouble self regulating symptoms like nausea and eyestrain  and the larger psychological impact has yet to be studied there   s also the issue of endurance  i generally don   t have a problem  though last week  after i spent    minutes lost in the gear vr headset   by far the longest i   d kept it on   i felt like i   d just ridden the cyclone at coney island down on the ice  madison square garden doesn   t feel as gigantic  but the rangers    goal seems really big when you   re trying to defend it  i skate out in front of the net to where   i know from virtual practice   i   ll have better luck blocking shots  looking out at the empty seats  i have that d  j   vu again  this time  at least  real rangers aren   t taking     mph slap shots at me not even the most amazing

       film can provide the holy wow i   m really here sensation of a vr headset  it   s unlocking sports and entertainment experiences most of us would otherwise never have the rangers goalie tryout  available at the garden  is the best example yet  instead of donning a helmet and pads  you step into an area with motion sensors  put on an htc vive headset and grab controllers  you wave your arms  blocking and shifting position  as hulking hockey players take shots on you  the whole experience was put together by a vr startup called strivr while strivr is focused mainly on pro training simulations  the nfl  nhl  nba  pga and other leagues are starting to capture games in     degree video  while they could possibly stream them one day  viewers now tend to get stuck in one place while the action moves elsewhere  games are also long  and could cause headset fatigue if  like me  you   d prefer a front row ticket to a show  you   ll be happy to hear that the vr revolution is hitting broadway  too

       these sorts of strange things can happen  you can be standing in a room when the floor falls away  leaving you terrified  on a skinny plank  you can appear before an audience of people who listen to your voice and follow your every move their goal is to shape our psyches or social perspectives with experiences we wouldn   t normally have  experiencing prejudice can produce empathy  prof  bailenson says  the crowd simulation is used to help overcome public speaking anxiety    the brain hasn   t evolved to differentiate a compelling virtual reality experience from something that would happen in the physical world     prof  bailenson says  that   s the scariest thing about this technology  i was put into a first person train heist game during an oculus demo at the consumer electronics show in january  firing the gun felt so real  i put it down and refused to fight  instead  i just looked out the window and enjoyed the scenery in the next few weeks  gamer focused systems like the      oculus rift and      htc vive will begin shipping  these high end headsets provide the best experience  but require you be tethered to a powerful desktop computer  with motion trackers marking your gaming space  stepping down means sacrificing graphics   and losing a lot of the magic  decent midlevel options include the      samsung gear vr and a coming lg headset designed to work with its new g  phone  vr dabblers can start super cheap  with a google cardboard plus some vr apps like vrse and jaunt we   ll all find our own uses for virtual reality  just like we did with
