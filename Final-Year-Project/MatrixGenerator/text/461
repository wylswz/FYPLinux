 playstation vr it   s the best way to bring virtual reality home right now  it   s also the funkiest  strap on these light up goggles and glow sticks  and you look like a character from    tron     sold in a      kit  the neon gear   s real purpose is helping any old playstation   to track your head and hands   so you can literally be in the middle of a game  look through the goggles  and you   re batman reaching for a grappling hook that   s actually at your hip  load a vr movie  and you   re playing director just by moving your head  sure  nobody   s going to confuse sony   s virtual reality with actual reality  you   re still wearing goggles  and you   ve got a long cord slithering down your back  but it offers some of the most fun i   ve had with videogames since my first virtual tennis match with the nintendo wii  playstation vr   s ability to put you in the action is a significant upgrade from standard console games and from the     degree experiences you might have tried on a smartphone  like google cardboard and samsung   s gear vr this isn   t a story about better tech  sony   s much hyped rivals  oculus rift and htc vive  which must be connected to powerful pcs  offer more sophisticated virtual reality experiences   vive remains my favorite tech demo of the year   it can fill an entire room with a virtual whale   but sony has wisely traded technical capability for something vr needs much more right now  broader appeal  playstation vr moves it out of the realm of expensive geek tech  and into something that fits in an actual family room i   ve been sharing a test playstation vr with my colleague nathan olivarez giles for the past week  while vr has many potential uses  playstation vr really is just for entertainment  titles available when the headset launches next week include    games plus seven mini movies and other experiences  that   s fewer than the     titles that exist for oculus rift  although no doubt sony will be drawing on all those years of game and big budget movie experience  nathan and i both loved the movie and casual games that test your coordination and puzzle solving skills  he got sucked into games like    until dawn  rush of blood     where you shoot demonic clowns while riding on a roller coaster  you can read his gamer   s take on the starting lineup of titles here  playstation vr   s family friendly appeal begins with the fact that it works with any ps   there are already    million ps s in homes around the globe  and a new one sets you back as little as       in addition to the full      kit  there is a pared down      psvr setup for people who already own the camera and move sticks unwrap a few new pieces of psvr hardware  swap around a few plugs on your existing ps   and you   re set up in under    minutes   with the rift and vive  i regretted not getting an engineering degree  you need to connect them to a high end pc  with special graphics cards and drivers   the hardest part was figuring out where to put the camera that tracks you and your gear  sony suggests hanging it off the top of the tv  but it can   t be too high or too low  and if it   s pointing straight out a window  it could become confused by the sunlight playstation vr works in the space between your tv and your barcalounger  technically  it allows you to roam around a virtual space up to   feet wide by    feet deep   but most of the games sony made available for us to try were designed to be used while seated or standing pretty still  when you go outside of the psvr   s range  a box pops up with a warning to back up that pared down space is both curse and blessing  the out of bounds warnings are annoying  leaving game developers less to work with when creating immersive worlds  that likely means no living room wide doubles tennis matches  yet we saw plenty of creativity in the games we tested  one of my favorites  a     title called    thumper     makes you feel like you   re a beetle sliding through an alien highway   or is it a blood vessel  here the vr serves to make a traditional game style more intense rather than becoming a new way to operate the game  you can use psvr without remodeling your house   or designating a spotter to ensure you don   t chip a tooth on the coffee table  and that may be playstation vr   s greatest feature  instead of requiring you to fire up a windows pc then creep around furniture  it   s just sitting there  ready for a rainy day escape or fun with friends sony made some practical choices so its vr goggles are less annoying to wear  while the sony headset weighs about as much as the oculus headset  it felt less heavy because of how it rests on your head  flaps along the edges allow for air flow and block ambient light  though some people may still see some  i wore it for    minute stretches without steaming up the lenses or having my face feel hot  a warning message says playstation vr isn   t recommended for children    and under   the lenses are too far apart for very young heads  sony advises everyone to take a    minute break every hour inside the headgear  you   ve got about a     degree field of view  which is just narrow enough that it   s hard to forget you   re wearing goggles  but sony   s lenses and displays   which contain three    subpixels    for each of its more than   million pixels   do a better job than competitors at erasing the feeling that you   re looking through a screen door  the displays also use a very fast refresh rate   up to     hz   so looking at them while moving around left me feeling less queasy than oculus rift audio helps playstation vr move you  it can deliver audio  either to the included headphones or to your own favorite pair  that is specific to where you are in the virtual world  in the free    minute movie    allumette     an animated o  henry style story you watch from the clouds  at one point i heard some muffled sniffles that made me move around to find a hidden character     allumette    was the first vr experience that made me tear up as with standard playstation   titles  vr developers are all free to invent their own rules for interacting with games  that can be confusing  because there are infinitely more choices in vr  where you can interact with virtual worlds and in   d  with both a standard dualshock controller and move magic wands  for example  how do you move around batman   s cave in the        batman  arkham vr      turns out  like batman  you have to pull a grappling hook out of your belt and shoot it where you want to go   thankfully  many titles show you a virtual representation of the controllers when you are inside the goggles  so you don   t have to memorize the location of all the buttons there is just one more problem with the actual reality of vr  it   s just awful being a bystander while some goggle wearing geek gropes at digital dimensions you can   t see  but sony has some ideas on how to make things more collaborative   without two headsets  playstation vr comes with a    social screen    option  which lets friends  and annoying little brothers  watch what   s happening inside the vr goggles on the nearby tv sharing the playstation vr with me over lunch  nathan jeered when he saw my virtual batman appear on the tv   and fail to incapacitate the penguin   s henchmen in time  we passed the headset back and forth with ease  unlike competitors    headset designs  playstation   s doesn   t involve adjustable velcro straps for different head sizes  the psvr headset pulls apart with tension  instantly fitting different sized heads and noses  a knob in back tightens the whole thing they weren   t available to test  but sony has also promised games that will have an interactive element for people in the room who aren   t wearing goggles  one  called    keep talking and nobody explodes     traps the person wearing the headset in a virtual room with a bomb they must defuse  everyone else on the couch shouts instructions  which they get by deciphering what they see on the tv screen until vr rigs actually work like teleporters  any system that wants to earn a spot in my home has to fit in there  later this week   facebook

   s oculus is expected to unveil improvements to the rift system that could broaden its appeal  but sony has decades more experience making tech for living rooms  if oculus rift is the      product you hope your neighbor buys  playstation vr is the first virtual reality rig you   re likely to keep using  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
