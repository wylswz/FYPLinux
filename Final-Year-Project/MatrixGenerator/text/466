articles n c wyeths deeper aspirations            rockland  maine i can   t remember the last time i heard a screenwriter  a mystery novelist or a show tune composer express regret for having embraced so    lowly    a calling  nowadays  popular artists know that what they do is valuable in its own right  it hardly seems possible that when  aaron copland went to hollywood in      to score  lewis milestone   s film version of  john steinbeck   s    of mice and men     many of his fellow highbrows were sure that he was finished as a classical composer  today  they   d ask him for a letter of recommendation   n c  wyeth  painter    farnsworth art museum   through dec      i thought of copland   s film scores when i went to see    n c  wyeth  painter     an exhibition on display through dec     at the farnsworth art museum in rockland  maine  wyeth  who died in       was the father of  andrew wyeth  perhaps the most famous and beloved american painter of the   th century  in his lifetime  though  n c  was equally famous   though not as a maker of what we stubbornly continue to call    fine art     he was  rather  the most highly paid commercial illustrator of his day  while wyeth is now mainly known for having illustrated such children   s classics as    robinson crusoe        treasure island    and    the yearling     his work also appeared on the covers of mass circulation magazines like ladies    home journal and the saturday evening post  and in ads for cream of wheat and lucky strike cigarettes  in those days  the mass reproduction of photographs was an imperfect science  an artist who knew how to make bold  appealing illustrations was always in demand  and nobody did it better than wyeth  when he painted a cowboy on a bronco  you could hear the spurs jingling but wyeth believed that he was squandering his great gifts  unable to regard illustration as anything more than    the art of journalism  to be rendered in the manner of painting     he dreamed of being praised as    a painter who has shaken the dust of the illustrator from his heels      so he spent his spare time working on landscapes  portraits and studies of life in coastal maine  where he spent his summers  he saw these paintings  which bear such homely titles as    the harbor herring gut    and    fisherman   s family     as    the beginning of more important self expression     and they were intended not for magazines but galleries   and  eventually  museums  by the end of his life  he had accumulated several hundred of them  and     mostly dating from the late      s and      s  are on view at the farnsworth art critics and historians haven   t had much to say about wyeth   s    serious    work   david michaelis  author of    n c  wyeth     an excellent      biography which argues that his illustrations deserve to be taken very seriously indeed   a point of view now generally accepted by scholars   wrote off wyeth   s    independent    paintings in a single curt sentence     he deliberately intended these paintings to be taken as statements of his most personal feelings  yet he left out or deflated the very pictorial elements that made his canvases most his own    to visit the farnsworth  however  is to realize that mr  michaelis got it almost exactly wrong  these burgeoningly vital  at times near primitive paintings  whose bold swashes of magenta and turquoise recall the fauvism of  andr   derain and  henri matisse  make andrew look prim  even more to the point  they appear to have been strongly influenced by such early american modern painters as  marsden hartley and  maurice prendergast  whose names go unmentioned in mr  michaelis   s book  it amazed me to learn that an artist best remembered for his nostalgic magazine covers seems to have known so much about the art of his time   and was eager to incorporate it into his own work  it   s as if  norman rockwell had decided to take up color field painting in his old age the more i think about wyeth  the more i find myself thinking not only of copland  but of bert lahr   s celebrated performance as estragon in the      broadway premiere of  samuel beckett   s    waiting for godot     the most influential avant garde play of the   th century  who knew that the cowardly lion of    the wizard of oz    had such immortal longings in him   or that the well paid illustrator who painted steaming bowls of cream of wheat was also capable of turning out excitingly modern canvases i hope that an expanded version of this show will travel to other museums  not least because it offers so timely a reminder of the value of artistic ambition  yes  n c  wyeth   s illustrations are marvelous in their own right  i wish he   d known how good they were  but he was old fashioned enough to believe that he had an obligation to aim higher  and because he did  we have    the harbor herring gut     like bert lahr  he thought there was more in him than mere popularity   and he was right  mr
