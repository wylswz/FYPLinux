articles sb                                         when we think about brilliant u s  foreign policy minds  we don t usually think of  abraham lincoln   and he didn t either   i don t know anything about diplomacy   he told one foreign envoy at the start of his first term   i will be very apt to make blunders   the most ambitious foreign trip he ever took was a jaunt to the canadian side of niagara falls  shortly before his assassination  he had delighted his wife mary by promising her that they would visit europe for the first time after his presidency was over  he spoke no foreign languages and couldn t even read a menu in french  the   th century language of diplomacy   hold on there   he once begged a more cosmopolitan waiter in a new york french restaurant   beans  i know beans   but despite his rough hewed background  the backwoods lawyer turned out to be a surprisingly supple  sophisticated and successful diplomat  presidents of every stripe invoke lincoln to address problems of every shade  but the   th president s shrewd foreign policy has been virtually forgotten  so what lessons from lincoln s diplomacy can we apply to our own seemingly intractable foreign policy dilemmas  first  resist the temptation to withdraw from the world   and get up to speed about it quickly  green though he was about world politics when he entered the white house  lincoln swiftly realized that he couldn t ignore them  he was besieged almost as soon as he took office with bellicose european statesmen  hawkish confederate expansionists   and occasionally his own hotheaded secretary of state   william h  seward  lincoln felt the pressures of the world so acutely that he could sometimes not get out of bed  and yet he got the job done   and then some  above all  he kept britain and france out of the conflict  thereby snipping potential life lines that might have saved the confederacy or prolonged the civil war   no battle  not gettysburg  not the wilderness  was more important than the contest waged in the diplomatic arena   the historian  allan nevins observed  second  recognize the fine line between reactive paralysis and shrewd restraint  lincoln was a master of the latter  patience  his personal secretary  john hay once remarked  was  one of the cardinal elements of his character   lincoln  like many of today s foreign policy realists  believed that nurturing the u s  economy   not embarking on overseas adventures   would prove the more effective method of husbanding and expanding u s  power  the whig party  which lincoln joined as he grew into adulthood  did  not believe in enlarging our field   he later explained   but in keeping our fences where they are and cultivating our present possession  making it a garden  lincoln was an exceptionalist  believing profoundly in the importance of the american experiment  but he wasn t a crusader  he remained a lifelong skeptic of grand foreign exploits   resisting imprudent calls for military action abroad and preventing diplomatic donnybrooks from morphing into war  the rail splitter  his law partner recalled  was  a realist as opposed to an idealist   he had to be  the mid   th century world  like our own multipolar planet  was an unforgiving place  the era produced merciless titans such as prussia s  otto von bismarck and britain s lord palmerston  who famously argued that british foreign policy should be guided by national interests alone  not mushy notions of international friendship  in both eras  rash overextension could prove fatal  lincoln liked to use homey metaphors to describe his reluctance to intervene in disputes he considered none of his business   i learned a great many years ago   he once explained   that in a fight between man and wife  a third party should never get between the woman s skillet and the man s ax helve   even modest gestures   such as shipping weapons to dubious allies   gave lincoln pause  he feared that they might fall into the wrong hands  once  when asked to send arms to unofficial union supporters in virginia  lincoln explained that the proposal would be like giving a stranger an ax to cut down a tree  the tree might well fall  but the man wielding his new hatchet might later  turn round and brain you with it   this restraint permeated lincoln s diplomacy  when some advisers wanted to take a confrontational line during an      diplomatic showdown with the british  lincoln gently replied   one war at a time   when a lengthy civil conflict erupted in the dominican republic between local militiamen and their spanish overlords  some of lincoln s allies urged him to publicly support the freedom fighters  lincoln  wary of antagonizing the spanish government in the midst of the civil war  ignored their pleas  to explain his position  lincoln told a yarn about a man who went to see his preacher for advice  the clergyman  in lincoln s telling  told his parishioner that two roads lay before the man   one that went  straight to hell   another that went  right to damnation   if those were the only options  the advice seeker replied  he would take a third route   i shall go through the woods   lincoln too explained that he wanted to  take to the woods    and remain neutral on the dominican conflict  beyond lincoln s skepticism about involvement in foreign flashpoints  his era should also remind us to keep an eye on rising powers  the u s  of the mid   th century was itself what we would now call an emerging market   the china of its day  in fact  full of economic promise but with a less certain political future  lincoln s victory at home led directly to u s  ascension abroad  we can draw a straight line from lincoln s triumph in the civil war to the rise of the u s  as a world power in the decades that followed above all  lincoln s statesmanship should remind us of the virtue of humility  even lincoln probably wouldn t have been any more successful than we are at solving our most delicate foreign policy worries  indeed  most aren t problems that can truly be  solved   lincoln was keenly aware of the difference between wars that must be won and crises that should be managed  we should be too    mr  peraino is the author of  lincoln in the world  the making of a statesman and the dawn of american power   recently published by crown
