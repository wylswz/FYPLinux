articles sb                  like the cinderella figure she plays in disney s  enchanted   amy adams spreads a contagion of delight  the movie is great fun  but she s enchanting  this is one of those performances that announces  in the fullest sense of the term  the arrival of a star the announcement is made initially via animation  the story begins as a seemingly classic hand painted disney cartoon  but with a cantering spirit of self parody that the director  kevin lima  reins in safely this side of camp  amy adams is the voice of giselle  a commoner singing  ever so tremulously and snow whitely  about true love to a twittering audience of forest animals that includes her favorite chipmunk  pip  already ms  adams s performance is audacious in its fruitcake ardor  yet that s only a token of what s to come when giselle  on the day she s to marry a charming prince  is banished by his stepmother  a wicked queen  to a place where there are no happy ever afters  i e  live action manhattan  which she enters as an extralegal alien through a con ed steam tunnel beneath times square the film plays each of its worlds against the other  it s lovely to see a hitherto animated about to be princess plunked down    or  rather  hurtled up    into what passes for urban reality  where she natters on about how her silkworm friends made her voluminous wedding gown  though the rabbits did help with the sewing  but the conceit succeeds as well as it does    almost totally    because the star sustains it with a tonal delicacy and poise worthy of the young julie andrews  who made a pretty popular picture for disney a while ago  and who provides the narrator s voice in this one  giselle thinks indoor plumbing is magical  i thought the movie was magical when giselle  having chanced to meet robert  a handsome single father and about to be married divorce lawyer played by patrick dempsey  summons an animated battalion of local animals for a thorough cleaning of his riverside drive apartment  and for a gleeful variation on the theme of  whistle while you work    or when she strolls with him through central park  bursts uncontrollably into song    alan menken and stephen schwartz did the original score    and soon has the park s human population singing and dancing with her ms  adams s triumph won t come as a complete surprise to those  few  who saw  junebug   a small  distinctive film in which she played  with heartbreaking eloquence  a pregnant young woman lost in a bad marriage and foolish dreams  still  that performance could not have predicted the variety and electrifying energy of this one  any more than mr  lima s direction of disney s      animated feature  tarzan  could have predicted the verve and confidence of his live action work here   he directed from an original screenplay by bill kelly  and  enchanted   for all of its amiable borrowings and occasional stumbles  truly is alive  the film doesn t feel corporate  formulaic or machine made  except for a hyperventilating climax with an overwrought dragon   and for robert s needlessly unpleasant fianc eacute e    and giselle s rival    played by idina menzel   a striking departure from disney s conventional calibrations  this family entertainment treats the subject of love and marriage with sophisticated wit  at one point there s even a brief discussion of irony  but the key word is striking    contemporary audiences will find the film refreshingly new  movie lovers with longer memories may find affecting resonances between wide eyed giselle  trying to figure out the love game s suddenly revised rules  and josh  the bewildered boy in a man s body played by tom hanks in  big   or jeff daniels s befuddled tom baxter  the explorer who steps out of the movie screen in  the purple rose of cairo  the prince of the piece  edward  is played by james marsden  for a while i wondered if he d be able to hold his own in a role that isn t fully written  edward leaves animation land to find his fianc eacute e  only to run into a succession of real life troubles that often depend on slapstick  but the actor is consistently likable  and it s perfectly fine that edward functions mainly as a hunky buffoon  susan sarandon gives evil her best    and very funny    shot as the voice of the wicked queen  while nathaniel  the prince s servant  is played by timothy spall  a virtuoso of the grotesque  mr  spall looks animated in the flesh one of the revelations of  no direction home   martin scorsese s documentary about bob dylan  was the extent to which the young dylan internalized the persona and the milieu  as well as the music  of woody guthrie  todd haynes s counterpart to that film   i m not there   takes a surreal approach to extending the observation    that dylan has internalized many artists and many of their qualities in the course of his remarkable career  there s literally no dylan on screen in this dylan film  though the sound track abounds in his songs  because some of the singer s salient qualities    not just influences  but essences    are represented by six different actors  including christian bale  richard gere  heath ledger and cate blanchett  it s an intriguing stunt  and ambitious in its effort to speak to the mystery of identity  but a stunt nevertheless  one that wears out its welcome with sluggish pacing  excessive length and some secondary performances of surprising clumsiness  there s nothing clumsy  though  about edward lachman s cinematography    it s revelatory from start to finish nicole kidman plays a psyche killer in  margot at the wedding   a new film by noah baumbach  his debut feature was  the squid and the whale   ms  kidman is margot zeller  an acerbic writer who shows up by surprise at the wedding of her estranged sister pauline  jennifer jason leigh  and promptly lays waste to everyone around her  maybe margot has a borderline personality disorder  maybe not  but she observes no boundaries in her infinite narcissism  and she s come to the right place  since pauline  who s about to marry a petulant  corpulent child  played cheerlessly by jack black   can give as bad as she gets when it comes to sibling rivalry  mr  baumbach s concern is  as in his previous film  the family romance and mutual need  but  margot  is unsparing  and ultimately punishing  in its insistence on the psychodynamics of dysfunction  it s not as if this gifted filmmaker is running on empty  you just wish he d find an alternative fuel dvd tip  julianne moore is the anguished isolate carol white in todd haynes s  safe          a surreal drama of suburbia that could be called  i m almost not there   carol thinks her problems stem from the environment  that she s a victim of fumes and noise and toxic substances  the movie suggests that it s deeper than that  a case of contemporary anomie that can t be cured by filters or new age retreats  i didn t much like  safe  when it came out  but the film has stuck in my mind  i should take my own recommendation and see it again write to joe morgenstern at joe morgenstern wsj com
