articles invisible bugs are falling from the trees in kansas cityand they bite           kansas city  mo    a midwestern metropolis is under attack from an unseen enemy  with victims pouring into doctors    offices and pharmacies with telltale wounds    right now i don   t even want to go outside to get the paper     said    year old chuck heinz  a retired manufacturing manager whose upper torso is peppered with dozens of welts megan kinser  who has been attacked at least two dozen times  goes out only when she has to     it makes me nervous     said the    year old pharmacy assistant the culprit  pyemotes herfsi  otherwise known as the oak leaf itch mite the eight legged pest causes intense itching in humans  researchers believe the bug  native to central europe  made its u s  debut in the     s in kansas city and has since spread to many parts of the midwest  with outbreaks happening every three to eight years  nearly invisible to the eye at      th of an inch  the mites are back in full force    you can   t see them  they   re microscopic and before you know it they   re under your skin     said jared mayberry  marketing director of ryan lawn   tree in overland park  kan people are being told to wear hats and cover most of their skin when they go out and to jump in the shower as soon as they go inside  and to avoid walking under red oaks  particularly pin oaks  but with at least     million pin and other red oak trees in the greater kansas city area  according to a      estimate by the agriculture department  that may be easier said than done the arachnid becomes of most concern to humans in the fall  after it spends all summer feasting on the larvae of a gall midge  a fly that nests in oak leaves  the itch mites eventually tumble to earth this time of year   as many as         a day per tree the problem for humans  experts say  is that the itch mites fall on anyone who happens to be passing by and can even be blown by the wind into homes  where they are small enough to fit through a screen window  they bite anything they touch  but the victims don   t realize it until hours later when they experience itching that some have described as worse than poison ivy and can last a week or more    the worst part is at night when you dig at the bites     said dr  anthony healy  an itch bite victim and family practitioner at shawnee mission primary care in shawnee mission  kan   who estimates one fifth of his    or so daily patients complain of being bitten avoiding the itch mites is so difficult that in       the centers for disease control and prevention estimated about half the        residents of crawford county  kan   succumbed to bites  outbreaks have been reported from cleveland to chicago  and last year tulsa  okla   was in the crosshairs outbreaks usually end with the first hard freeze  when researchers say the tiny parasites die out in       researchers at kansas state university first documented oak leaf itch mites when a rash of mysterious bug bites swept through the kansas city area  chiggers   common mites in the midwest that inhabit the grass   were believed responsible but they usually only bite ankles and other lower extremities   not the head  back and other parts of the upper body which were under attack  said rick miller  a kansas state agriculture extension agent in olathe  kan    we had no clue what the bites were     mr  miller said closer examination of kansas city   s oaks revealed many of their leaves bore scars called galls  which the midge makes to lay eggs  and they were crawling with oak leaf itch mites    see these puffy growth areas around the vein     mr  miller said  pointing to some galls on an oak leaf near his office recently     i   m thinking there are some mites in them     two days later  mr  miller noticed some welts on his arm that he said were from bites he evidently received handling that leaf in       the mites hit places such as the university of kansas in nearby lawrence  jill hummels  communications manager for the provost   s office there  said she noticed a large bite on her right arm     i had never seen anything like it before   like the size of a dollar coin and red  and itchy     said ms  hummels      who figures she was attacked walking under the campus   s many pin oaks dr  douglas dechairo  director and chief of staff of ku   s watkins health services  said   to    students a day sought treatment for itch mite bites last autumn and more are doing so this year  k    schools are busy treating students  too     the weather   s beautiful so everybody wants to go outside     said sharon morris  district nurse for the blue valley school district in johnson county  kan     that   s the worst of it    perhaps the creepiest part is how little can be done  spraying pesticide on a tree or yard won   t work  because the mites can float in from non treated trees  said dennis patton  a kansas state horticulture extension agent  bug repellents aren   t very effective  either  because the itch mites aren   t seeking out humans   they just bite what they land on  he said    there really isn   t a fix to this     mr  patton said  to help cope  kansas citians have tried a hodgepodge of remedies and protection measures  mark tobin  who runs a lawn care service in the kansas city area  soaks his exposed skin in a lemon scented oil repellent called    whup a bug        i   m feeling like this is the bomb     said mr  tobin      his arms glistening as he operated a weed whacker recently patricia marken uses benadryl gel   after chilling it in her refrigerator     it   s like a little ice cube when you put it on     said ms  marken  a pharmacist from leawood  kan ms  kinser  who has suffered allergic reactions to the bites  said she walks her doberman  dillon  down the middle of her street in overland park to avoid oaks   and itch mites     they like me     she said in oak grove  mo   laci harris has bug spray bottles to try to protect her    month old son  truman  in her purse  diaper bag  car cup holder and on the shelf beside her front door  truman has suffered numerous bites  she said    he knows when he wants to go outside to play we have to spray first     said ms  harris      an administrative assistant     however  there have been times we walk out the door and go straight to the car and he   ll get a bite     is there any way to go bite proof in kansas city     i guess you could put on a body suit from top to bottom  like you   re handling toxic waste     mr  patton said     that would do it     write to
