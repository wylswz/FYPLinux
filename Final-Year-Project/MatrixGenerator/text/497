 the bombshell news from sweden   






        bob dylan


       winning the nobel prize in literature   would seem to be the last word in a debate that has swirled around the songwriter since he was pegged as the voice of a generation in the     s  do songs such as    my back pages    and    subterranean homesick blues    transcend pop music to qualify as great literature  for the nobel committee  apparently lyrics like    i was so much older then  i   m younger than that now    and    you don   t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows    put mr  dylan on par with

       and other american nobel laureates  he is the first musician to receive the award in its     year history     if you look far back        years or so  you discover homer and

       they wrote poetic texts that were meant to be listened to and performed  often together with instruments  and it   s the same way for bob dylan     said 






        sara danius 


       the permanent secretary of the swedish academy  in announcing the award  it   s a vindication for literary scholars who have sought to elevate his work  including

       an former oxford professor who compared the bard from hibbing  minn   to 






        keats 




        yeats


       and other great poets  others who have done line by line analysis have noted mr  dylan   s debt to english and scottish balladry  the song    a hard rain   s a gonna fall     for instance  borrows from the centuries old ballad

         the nobel news riled some writers who objected to literature   s highest honor going to a musician  regardless of his unofficial stature as    poet laureate of rock    n    roll

        saladin ahmed 


       a detroit based author of    throne of the crescent moon     an arabian inspired fantasy novel  questioned why mr  dylan was the first musician to get the nobel     what makes him more worthy of this or more fitting to be recognized as literary  as opposed to the god knows how many troubadours in god knows how many languages that have preceded him

       saw when he was growing up  i think you could trace what i do back that far     he said last year while accepting an award from the charity arm of the grammy awards mr  dylan  who has written books and stories as well as more than     songs  has often defined himself first and foremost as a musician  he was scheduled to perform thursday night at the cosmopolitan casino in las vegas before a second engagement this weekend at the desert trip festival in indio  calif   where he shares the bill with

        neil young


       and other giants of classic rock  mr  dylan has performed more than       shows since       according to pollstar  more than three times as many concerts as any other desert trip headliner  as with the workmanlike schedule of his so called    never ending tour     mr  dylan refers to himself as a tradesman in terms of writing  one who deals with mythic themes that go beyond folk music     it   s called tradition  and that   s what i deal in  traditional  with a capital t     he said in a      interview with rolling stone  among other songwriters  mr  dylan has always differentiated himself by the breadth of his influences  vacuuming up writings from the bible to rimbaud  chekhov to fellow nobel recipient

         not to mention more direct influences in music  from country blues singer

        sean wilentz 


       a princeton american history professor and author of    dylan in america     british music historian 






        clinton heylin 


       the author of several books on the artist  said he participated in a conference a few years ago which debated whether or not mr  dylan   s work merited the nobel  he argued yes     his influence is so overarching     he says     you do have to start saying  well who exactly is it that you   re thinking of picking first     citing beat writers including 






        jack kerouac


       and 






        allen ginsberg


        who was a friend of mr  dylan   s   mr  heylin says     something like    hard rain   s a gonna fall    could not exist without the beats     he said     it   s to do with the line structure and the rat a tat tat of imagery    author ron rosenbaum  who has written about mr  dylan extensively  says mr  dylan managed to    mine and undermine language  speech and emotion  crystallize feelings in a way that remains still mysterious and magical   i think he   s had a kind of subtle effect on language  on the deadpan  put on  sarcastic way we talk     mr  dylan   s odds of winning have been an annual source of speculation for bookmakers and music nerds  always eager to debate his place in the pantheon   






        gordon ball 


       an english professor at washington and lee university who first submitted mr  dylan as a nobel candidate in       described his mission in an article published in the journal oral tradition     i cited the almost unlimited dimensions of dylan   s work  how it has permeated the globe and affected history     in an interview  mr  ball added that he has sent in at least a dozen more bids to the swedish academy over the years in    long letters with updated perspectives    some who criticized dylan   s laureate status pointed to his habit of borrowing the words of others and repurposing them as his own  among other appropriations  mr  dylan was accused of lifting lines from 






        jack london


       for his    chronicles  volume one    memoir  lines from a japanese novelist  junichi saga  showed up in songs from the      album    love and theft     in       mr  dylan told rolling stone magazine     in folk and jazz  quotation is a rich and enriching tradition   it has to do with melody and rhythm  and then after that  anything goes  you make everything yours  we all do it    
   if you   re a    music    fan  look it up in the dictionary  then    literature     compare and contrast    
mr  wilentz goes further     people are confusing art with a term paper  it shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what artists do  why single him out  he   s no more a plagiarist than 






        t s  eliot


       or 






        thelonious monk 


          seeming to acknowledge mr  dylan   s artistic cutting and pasting  ms  danius of the nobel organization referred to him    a wonderful sampler    exhibit a in the case for mr  dylan as a literary lion is the archive of his work coming together at the university of tulsa  trucks full of manuscripts  notebooks  photographs and audio visual recordings have been arriving there since the bob dylan archive was announced last march  the career spanning collection of       items was bought by the university and the george kaiser family foundation  and is expected to open to researchers by spring       it   s no coincidence that the university  which offers an undergraduate course on mr  dylan   s work  also hosts the papers of the songwriter   s most important musical and literary inspiration  






        woody guthrie 


       for dylan scholars who have had to make their own subjective studies of his lyrics  the archive beckons as a fount of primary source material     it should turn a lot of dylan studies on their head and open up an entirely new continent in terms of his writing     says 






        michael chaiken 


       the archivist in charge of processing the collection  he cites mr  dylan   s continuous stream of writing and    ruthless self editing    as evidence that he   s more than just a lyricist  the songwriter filled a quarter of a notebook alone with drafts of    tangled up in blue     a song on the album    blood on the tracks     the      release  which heralded an artistic rebirth  might have been what mr  dylan was referring to in his    chronicles    book as    an entire album based on chekhov stories   critics thought it was autobiographical   that was fine     he didn   t name the album  an indian writer  rabindranath tagore  won the nobel prize in literature in       although he won for poetry  he also wrote songs the nobel prize will only heighten the interest of scholars  who are lining up for a peek at the archives  with the collection on his home turf  university of tulsa english department chair
