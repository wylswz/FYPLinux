articles harmonizing a diverse lineup at eaux claires            eau claire  wis  curated by local resident  justin vernon  best known as the leader of bon iver  and the national   s  aaron dessner  the second annual eaux claires music   arts festival  held here this past weekend  provided a superior experience  concertgoers could see erykah badu  beach house   james blake  jon hopkins  mavis staples  vince staples  melvins and  shabazz palaces   all headliners in their genres   and about    other acts on six stages   bruce hornsby and his band performed his      multi platinum album    the way it is    and cornelius  the working name of japanese musician  keigo oyamada  revived his       experimental rock and pop disc    fantasma     mr  dessner and his twin brother  bryce  also of the national  led a cadre of musicians through a review of songs that appear on    day of the dead     a surprisingly fine      album they produced of songs associated with the grateful dead  francis and the lights previewed its forthcoming album  reportedly titled    farewell  starlite    but the most anticipated set was the unveiling of new music by bon iver  which hasn   t released an album of original material since       the first public performance of        a million    was thoroughly engaging and occasionally thrilling  it is solidly in line with bon iver   s familiar blend of folk and electronica  and yet it is more aggressive at times and more deeply set in experimentalism and post dubstep  on friday night  bon iver featured eight saxophonists who provided mr  vernon   s layered voice with forceful  highly textured support heightened by explosive when necessary percussion         a million    will be released officially on sept     the bon iver performance capped a day of extraordinary music that seemed interconnected  attributable not only to the messrs  dessner and vernon   s expert curating  but to the spirit of partnership among the musicians  with three members of ymusic   clarinetist hideaki aomori  trumpeter cj camerieri and flautist  alex sopp   sitting in with her band my brightest diamond   shara worden performed new material that fit well with her recent smart funk  on another stage  irish folk singer  lisa hannigan  with aaron dessner on guitar  played wispy songs  including some from her new album     at swim     out on friday  a trio of sisters from england  the staves were supported by ymusic as they married folk and contemporary chamber music  as a steady rain fell on the vast  woody pitch  eighth blackbird and members of ymusic and so percussion joined to perform a reading of  steve reich   s pulitzer prize winning    double sextet     in this context  james blake   s quietly exhilarating set of airy  soulful electronica displayed its chamber music roots  mr  blake is also influenced by bon iver   s earlier recordings  in turn  when mr  vernon and bon iver followed mr  blake   s set  it became equally clear that        a million    is influenced by mr  blake   s inventive use of synthesized sounds that sort of artistic symbiosis was prevalent throughout eaux claires  on sunny saturday  ms  worden sang with so percussion  the staves appeared with  jenny lewis  and holly laessig and  jess wolfe of lucius joined mavis staples  who gave a moving reading of mr  vernon   s    dedicated     which appears on her      album    livin    on a high note     a gracious  grateful host  mr  vernon performed with his former band mate  phil cook of megafaun and  along with unannounced guest chance the rapper  sang and danced with francis and the lights  mr  hornsby   s friday evening performances of    the way it is    was a treat in itself  and his band  the noisemakers  was in a mischievous mood  mr  hornsby dedicated a song to the band   s  levon helm and then  as he was set to move on to the album   s title track  his keyboardist  j t  thomas interjected a quote from the band   s    chest fever     the classically trained mr  hornsby discarded his hit   s notable introduction  and his band adapted instantly more than a dozen artists who played their own sets at eaux claires participated in saturday   s    day of the dead    celebration with members of the national proving support  from the stage  aaron dessner said     it   s not easy to play the songs of the grateful dead that we all revere     but the musicians moved effortless through the    minute concert  easing up on the reverence and offering instead a performance somewhere between a challenge and a lark  ballads worked best     black muddy river    sang by messrs  hornsby and vernon     if i had the world to give    by  will oldham aka bonnie    prince    billy  and    standing on the moon    by  matthew houck  who performs as phosphorescent  the baritone voice of the national   s lead singer  matt berninger was ideal for a dark take on    morning dew     the revelation of new music by bon iver will be the second eaux claires   s most memorial takeaway   and rightfully so  but the event   s inclusive approach to programming and the eagerness to collaborate shared by the gifted  progressive musicians gave the boutique festival a memorable sense of   lan  for two days  it seemed curators dessner and vernon had created in wisconsin a kind of musical paradise  mr  fusilli is the journal   s rock and pop music
