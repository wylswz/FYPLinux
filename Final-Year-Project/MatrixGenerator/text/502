 serena williams does not consider herself a morning person      not at all     she says with a distressed look   but if she could wake up one morning and not be a globally famous tennis champion  here   s what she would do  go to an amusement park  or shop at the grocery store     ordinary things     she says     i   d go to the mall  i never go to the mall    it   s early spring  and williams is sitting on an outdoor couch near the pool at her handsome two story home in palm beach gardens  florida  chip  williams   s energetic yorkshire terrier  and lorelei  her maltese  roll on the cushion between us  williams is dressed post training casual  purple nike headband  white top  shorts  her feet are bare    i ask williams who she thinks she would be right now if she hadn   t ever picked up a tennis racket    i think i would be in california     she says     maybe i would be married  maybe i would have kids  i would like to believe i would  i would have probably gone into some kind of science  i love animals     she rubs lorelei on her pink  white haired belly     maybe i would have become a veterinarian    williams did pick up a tennis racket  of course  and the rest is a history well known and remarkable  in a few hours  williams will get into a car for miami  heading to the airport and europe and a clay court season that will conclude in paris at the      french open  where she is the defending women   s singles champion  at the end of june comes wimbledon  where williams is also the defending champion   she has won six times  entering this year   s french open  williams had captured    women   s singles grand slam titles in her tennis career  putting her at the doorstep of margaret court      and steffi graf       she had also won    additional slams in doubles and two more in mixed doubles  along with her four olympic gold medals  at     she is the oldest women   s tennis player to ever be ranked no      one could make a compelling case that williams is the greatest women   s player of all time   expert voices like chris evert now freely pronounce williams the best ever  but the story of how she got here   with her sister venus  african american champions from compton  california  schooled by an eccentric and prescient father  richard   is so dazzling and improbable it   s almost fable like  today 






        serena williams


       is at once a symbol of female and african american power  a philanthropist  social media influencer  fashion designer and celebrity unlike anyone in women   s sports  who can stand shoulder to shoulder with any icon of her era  when williams recently showed up in a video for beyonc     s new album  lemonade   dancing alongside the beguiling pop queen in a louisiana plantation home   her appearance felt both surprising and perfectly natural  beyonc    serena  of course     i   ve known bey for a long time     williams says  she also confesses     i got really sore from dancing    williams has been a superstar in full view for nearly two decades but still inhabits a complicated relationship with the public  i should come clean here  i think a lot of the griping about serena williams over the years has been utter nonsense  she   s had her unfortunate episodes   most memorably  a pair of verbal outbursts at the u s  open  which  while regrettable  hardly crack the upper echelon of antisocial moments in tennis history   meanwhile  john mcenroe  who routinely menaced umpires  and jimmy connors  a habitual crotch grabber  are celebrated as raffish antiheroes   only a fool would fail to see the obstacles and biases williams has overcome  which she noted last december after winning sports illustrated   s sportsperson of the year        i   ve had people put me down because i didn   t look like them     williams said in a speech captured in her documentary  serena  which arrived on epix june        i   ve had people look past me because of the color of my skin  i   ve had people overlook me because i was a woman     i   m still going    she is very much still going  when she is playing at her best  she remains unstoppable  at an age when tennis players are often years retired  she is rewriting the books  elite athletes who have breathed similar success cede to serena   s greatness     you can   t talk about women   s sports without first thinking of serena williams     says

       the recently retired u s  women   s soccer star who won two olympic golds and a world cup  to wambach  williams embodies    power  strength  beauty and confidence    or  to put it another way     what it means to be a badass female anything     last year  i watched williams stand in the hot afternoon sun in new york and hit serves for an hour and a half  just serves  one after the next  she had won an early round match at the u s  open  but her serve had been rocky  and the match wound up narrower than it should have been  minutes after leaving the arthur ashe stadium court  williams walked out to the practice area with her coach  patrick mouratoglou  and began to serve  a crowd quickly gathered   serena williams  williams kept serving  the crowd grew  williams kept serving  and serving  after a while  the crowd got a little bored and began to thin  williams kept serving and serving  she stayed until she felt she   d gotten it right there   s often an assumption with sports superstars that once they   ve ascended to the top  the hardest work ends  but the opposite is usually true  whether it   s steph curry with his three point jump shots or

       throwing spirals  the greatest seem to work harder once they   ve been recognized as great  as if that status is perpetually under attack  williams is the same  behind the scenes she is known as one of the hardest workers in the sport     the number of hours is one thing  but  more  impressive is the effort     says mouratoglou     she expects the best from herself    to be a champion today requires an obsessive attention to detail  i ask williams what she thinks tv announcers miss during tennis matches   what they don   t talk about but should     i don   t think they talk enough about the lifestyle and what it   s  become  in the past    years     she says     players used to have their parents  or a coach  but now you wake up  sleep  eat   everything is tennis  the gym is tennis  nutrition  physio    in williams   s living room  next to the clean white couch and a pod chair that hangs from the ceiling     i saw it on pinterest     williams says proudly   is perhaps the home   s most important piece of furniture  a massage table  at this point in her career  nagging aches and pains should be constant  but williams says her body feels good when she wakes up   williams is an unapologetic night owl   it   s not uncommon for her to stay awake until   or   a m  working on her various projects     i try to skip the mornings     despite those extra practice serves  williams did not win the      u s  open  losing in a semifinal shocker to the unseeded italian veteran roberta vinci  a defeat that was immediately categorized as one of the biggest sports upsets ever  though williams admitted the loss was painful and hard to put behind her  some perspective is useful  at that point  williams had already won the      open and then the      australian open  french open and wimbledon all in a row  the only thing denied was a fifth straight major and the symmetry of a    calendar    grand slam  there is not a tennis player in the world who wouldn   t take that kind of run  it was not exactly a disaster  williams would move on     there are very few champions on this planet  and they share things in common     says mouratoglou     one of those things is the ability to forget the past     they never look behind  always ahead    after the open  williams put down her racket for a while  she immediately threw herself into new york fashion week with a show for the serena williams signature statement line she sells on hsn  unveiling a line of fringe inspired evening dresses and weekend wear  vogue editor

       and williams   s then rumored paramour  drake  sat in the front row  after an upset loss  a lot of people would want to lie in bed and eat a tub of h  agen dazs  instead there was williams  walking down the runway  trading one pressurized centrifuge for another williams   s interest in fashion has long passed the point where it could be considered a part time hobby  both she and venus  a designer herself  attended fashion school amid their tennis careers  and serena obsesses over details like model casting and hair and makeup even as she plays in tournaments  whereas a lot of celebrity collections are simply stars signing off on other people   s work  williams considers it a point of pride that she knows    how garments work  fabrics work  how patterns are conceived       sometimes people just put their name on something and turn up at the event  and that   s it     says wintour     serena has the passion and the drive to make it her own  which is so different from many of these celebrities    williams was once criticized for having interests outside of tennis  both she and venus heard it  they   re not focused  they   re not serious enough  fashion school  you   ve got to be kidding me  over time  however  it   s become apparent that those departures probably extended the careers of both sisters  tennis is a game rife with early burnout  the byproduct of childhoods and adolescences devoted exclusively to one thing  caring about something besides tennis isn   t bad  it   s healthy    i think it was great that they did that     says 






        billie jean king 


       the women   s tennis legend who played singles until she was nearly    and doubles even longer     why not  people should have the journey that they want    today  williams   s off court passions are part of what fans love about her  it   s where they get to see the other serena  who   s more relaxed and a bit of a goof     she   s really funny     says her close friend and tennis competitor 






        caroline wozniacki 


          we both think we   re hilarious and could be comedians    by now everyone in tennis knows that serena williams is a karaoke warrior     that   s her thing     says wozniacki   but she also continues to be fascinated with dance  each year  she and venus host a competition called the williams invitational in which teams compete in  among other events  dance routines  then there was williams   s appearance in beyonc     s    sorry    video  which serena had to keep confidential for months    if you tell me     don   t say anything     i won   t say anything     williams says    she really kept it a secret     says wozniacki  who didn   t know about the video until she saw it    sorry    is an edgy hit  but williams   s favorite dance song is more of a vintage choice     conga     by gloria estefan and miami sound machine  her favorite tv show  the golden girls   yes  i will point out that both    conga    and the golden girls debuted in       when williams was a toddler   she has never watched game of thrones     i saw the first five minutes  and i was like     this is waaaaay too much for me          she wishes she got out more     i am too much of a hermit     she admits     i go through phases   i was going out to dinner a lot  but i   ve  reverted  to my old  staying home thing    if serena williams could spend a day following one person  who would it be     elon musk     she says     i   d follow him to see what he   s doing with all his innovations  all of the stuff he   s creating  i   d love to figure out where he   s going     williams   s      did not begin like her steamroller       in january  she lost the australian open final in three sets to germany   s angelique kerber  then in the indian wells final to victoria azarenka  she finally won her first tournament in mid may at the italian open  a few days after a bizarre incident in which she snacked on some of chip   s hotel room service dog food and got an upset stomach  an episode discussed in detail on snapchat     not as great as i want it to be     says williams  assessing her year so far     i could do better  but honestly  that   s how i felt about         just to clarify  in       serena williams went        when i ask what she   s most proud of in her career  she doesn   t mention a medal or a slam  she says she   s most proud of her return to indian wells  the california tournament she and venus shunned for nearly a decade and a half after serena was mercilessly booed in the      final  a couple of days after venus had withdrawn from their semifinal match with an injury     i don   t blame them for not playing there     says billie jean king     people treated them horribly  i was there  i think it   s great she went back       to be forgiving     williams says     i am proud of that    oddly  williams found herself drawn into another indian wells controversy at this year   s tournament  when the event   s ceo  raymond moore  made a series of tin eared remarks on the topic of equal pay in the sport  claiming  among other things  that if he were a    lady player    he would    go down every night on my knees and thank god 






        roger federer


       and rafa nadal were born  because they have carried this sport       we  as women  have come a long way     williams said at a tournament press conference shortly before moore would resign under pressure     we shouldn   t have to drop to our knees at any point    even as an ensconced world no     williams cannot avoid questions about her tennis mortality  mouratoglou says that at this point  williams is in it for the slams      i do not think that her ranking is important to her      and thinks she will stop only when she does not believe she can win major tournaments  williams does not have a reliable nemesis on tour  the women   s game   s second most decorated player  






        maria sharapova 


       is currently serving a suspension for taking a banned prescription drug  but sharapova is hardly a rival   she hasn   t beaten williams in more than    years king thinks williams has plenty left     there are lots of records to break  if she wants it     she says     when you get to her age  you have to decide how much you   re willing to invest physically  emotionally  if the return on investment is worth the effort  and the effort is more as you get older  not less       i think it will hit me     williams says     i   ll just have the feeling of    i don   t want to do it anymore        the end does not appear to be imminent  as for williams   s post tennis life  there   s her fashion business  which she hopes to expand  there are her philanthropic efforts  like the schools she sponsors in kenya and jamaica  when i ask williams if she could see herself in a tv booth during a tennis match  she won   t rule it out   the only idea she gives a stern no to is coaching     she has so many avenues open to her i can   t imagine her being defined by one choice     says wintour     you give up your life to go on that circuit  i imagine she   ll enjoy the freedom after tennis       being a mom would be fun     williams says  how many children    twelve     she says  deadpan     a baker   s dozen     she continues  laughing williams   s life remains such a whirlwind that she fantasizes mostly about taking a break  a perfect day off  she says  would be sitting at home on the couch watching netflix and investigation discovery  and maybe taking a dance class  but such days almost never happen  those ordinary things like amusement parks  grocery stores and trips to the mall that williams sometimes craves still feel far away  they might not happen for a long while  because serena williams picked up that tennis racket and built an extraordinary life  write to jason gay at jason gay wsj com serena williams finally unleashed the fury  wsj tom perrotta june         so let   s get this straight she smashes her racket  throws it into the
