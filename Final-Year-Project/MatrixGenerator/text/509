articles is harlem new york citys next art enclave            for the hard charging art dealer elizabeth dee  even a leisurely bike ride is a business opportunity  after buying an apartment in harlem four years ago  she pedaled around    asset mapping    the neighborhood  with the lease on her chelsea gallery set to expire in early        dee  was hunting for a new space when she cycled past an abandoned building with two sun filled floors on fifth avenue at    th street  right next to the national black theatre  through a chat with a local merchant  she found her way to the owner and signed a new lease   on a hot summer morning months later   dee      is trying her best to be heard over the banging of construction workers who are readying the new gallery for its late september debut     by the time i left chelsea it had become   th street     she says  referring to the manhattan retail haven  in harlem     you still have mom and pop stores  there   s the familiarity of a village  the economic and social diversity is radical in relationship to chelsea    contemporary art gallery gavin brown   s enterprise moved from the west village to    th street earlier this year  and the studio museum in harlem  which  coincidentally  had its first home in  dee   s new space  is planning a major expansion with noted architect david adjaye  many artists  including julie mehretu and ugo rondinone and his partner  john giorno  whom dee represents   have already migrated north  dee is confident other galleries will follow  whether big operations in search of satellite spaces or smaller ones like her own that are getting priced out of downtown by taking on an impressive        square feet far from the art world   s central arteries   chelsea  the upper east side and the lower east side   dee  may have finally found a match for her outsize ambitions   but it   s not the first time she has plunged into a risky endeavor  in       amid the global financial meltdown  she put together x initiative  a yearlong not for profit series of projects  the following year  underwhelmed by the mall like aesthetic of art fairs   dee  co founded independent  which now stages annual fairs in new york and brussels  where it also boasts an exhibition space she has also taken chances in her gallery program  often showing art by virtually unknown artists that was not obviously commercial  in       ryan mcnamara  for instance  hung every    artwork    he   d made since early childhood and gave tours of his personal art history   dee  managed to sell the performance piece  comprising mcnamara   s future performances of it along with the archive  to prominent collectors philip and shelley fox aarons  in mcnamara   s next show  dee sold hundreds of small pieces decoupaged with photos he   d taken of gallery visitors  each for a few thousand dollars      so now hundreds of collectors have something by ryan mcnamara in their collections     she says     that   s game changing    chelsea had its advantages in the aughts  being what  dee  calls a    cultural campus     pre   high line and condo frenzy  but when she wanted to mount a comprehensive exhibition of the work of seminal african american conceptual artist adrian piper in       she had to rent an entire floor of dia   s old building because her quarters were so cramped  fast rising real estate prices  driven in part by behemoths such as gagosian  david zwirner  pace and hauser   wirth  made expansion prohibitive in harlem   dee  has increased her space sixfold  she now has the luxury of staging multiple exhibits simultaneously and is christening the gallery with a group show  as well as the first of a series she has dubbed research  this periodic series is meant to bridge the gap between a gallery show of new work and a scholarly museum retrospective by focusing on a single key period for an artist  works may not even be for sale  the inaugural subject is mixed media artist annette lemieux  research shows on piper and on joan wallace are upcoming     these are not emerging artists      dee  says     this is a way to go deep    at the end of this month   dee  will unveil every future has a price     years after infotainment  a redux and expansion of the      survey infotainment  which introduced a generation of artists focused on appropriation and popular culture  including  dee artists julia wachtel and joel otterson  to audiences in half a dozen american and european cities but never ran in new york   dee  also is planning multiple programs and collaborations with organizations ranging from local nonprofits to columbia university through her days at michigan   s cranbrook schools and then at mount holyoke college in massachusetts  dee  nursed ambitions to be an artist  but after graduating  she landed a job at daniel weinberg gallery in san francisco  where she noticed that weinberg   s stable of stars  from jeff koons to sherrie levine  held him in great esteem  that respect persuaded her to become a dealer instead     that generation of artists understood how important the gallery was for getting their art seen      dee  says     you could see how significant dan   s role was  and i started to think of that as a potential art practice    the self assured dee  jump started her own collection by offering to pay weinberg artist barry le va for a drawing in monthly installments  she was earning         a year at the time      i wrote a check for     or       put it in the mail     she says  the following week a package arrived containing a black and white rorschach like piece   and her check     the note said     keep your f   ing money  love  barry        after two years in san francisco  she moved to new york  where she worked for luhring augustine gallery and  in       launched an experimental gallery in a soho loft  in       she opened officially in chelsea  where she exhibited artists such as enoc perez  josephine meckseper and mika tajima  the artist to whom  dee  has been most closely linked is experimental filmmaker ryan trecartin  whom she helped become a breakout star of the mid aughts  his edgy  frenetic  videos became widely shown in museums and sold for          apiece  trecartin broke with dee in      and joined andrea rosen gallery the following year   dee  admits to heartbreak when an artist leaves  but  she says     it   s a sign of success  if other galleries do not want your artists  maybe you   re not doing enough for them     she is also philosophical     it is a business relationship  it   s a lot of pressure on both artist and dealer to presume that forever should be the only goal  i   m much more interested in setting concrete goals  what our involvement will yield together  to our mutual benefit    she cites the rising profile and prices for wachtel   s whimsical but incisive paintings     when i first took her on  she was selling her work for under              dee  says     i said     no  your value needs to be on a par with your female   and male   peers  we   re talking         to         for your current work  over          for your      s work     we got there  within two years    wachtel  for her part  has cottoned to  dee   s old school approach dictating that a dealer   s job is not simply to sell art but to see to the near complete care and feeding of her artists     if i said i can   t get the dry cleaning  they would     wachtel says     there   s a kind of unconditional love   i   m sure it   s conditional at some point   but you   re certainly meant to feel that    as for the move to harlem  dee says she   s already noticed a change in her clients    demeanors when they make the trip uptown     the conversations are more in depth     she says     it   s not     i   ve gotta go to zwirner  then anton kern  then            she   s quick to caution that she doesn   t expect the area to become overrun with galleries     you have to consider what harlem is     she says     it   s vast  it   s as if we put stuyvesant town  alphabet city  the east village  soho  greenwich village and the west village together and called it one neighborhood
