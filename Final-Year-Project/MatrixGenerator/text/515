articles musicians meld traditions of two continents           the grammy award winning singer and clawhammer style banjo player  abigail washburn fell in love with appalachian music and chinese culture at roughly the same time  more than    years ago  she never figured the two would combine in career changing ways   wu fei  a master of the    stringed guzheng  a chinese zither  was groomed for greatness in her native country   s traditional music  she hardly expected to end up living in nashville  tenn   playing the instrument in wildly untraditional contexts in duet at symphony space monday  these musicians will showcase an innovative approach to cross cultural exchange   and a friendship that has crisscrossed the globe  they will perform as part of acoustic planet tales  a series running oct     to     curated by and featuring the widest ranging of banjo players  b  la fleck  who is ms  washburn   s husband the symphony space engagement represents the two women   s first full concert together  yet listeners can find them collaborating online  in one youtube video  from a brief performance last summer at vermont   s middlebury college  they combine    wusuli boat song     from the hezhe ethnic group  and    the water is wide     an american folk classic of scottish origin  the effect is less a mashup or medley than a simultaneous expression of melodies  languages and sentiments in natural harmony that performance reminded ms  washburn of her first meeting with ms  wu  in          fei began playing and singing folk songs from the sichuan province     ms  washburn said in an interview     and then i played folk tunes i knew  something clicked    ms  wu also felt a sudden charge  ms  washburn   s clawhammer playing reminded her of the three stringed sanxian  the chinese lute her father played     she unlocked something inside of me     ms  wu said     we knew we had to make more music    that didn   t happen until       once ms  wu had moved back to beijing and ms  washburn began touring regularly in china  they settled into a duo in       after ms  wu settled in nashville  they haven   t yet recorded an album  but for the past year they have been    building steam     ms  washburn said  through informal coffee shop performances and  lately  through a project with nashville schools showcasing their unique music and stories of cross cultural communion reaching across borders has proved remarkably smooth for this duo  in part because their instruments are naturally consonant and they are both bilingual  ms  washburn  who is    years old  had first visited china while in college and later  made plans to attend law school in beijing  but music interfered  inspired by folk master  doc watson  she bought a banjo  later  an impromptu audition during a bluegrass festival led to a record deal  as her music career blossomed  so did her engagement with china  in       she completed a month long tour of china   s silk road with support from the u s  embassy in beijing    i ended up finding an amazing way to connect with chinese people by making music     she said     one far deeper than i ever would have found through law    ms  wu      was on a clear path of chinese tradition until she moved to the u s  to study at mills college  where she encountered guitarist  fred frith  one of the many adventurous improvisers she has since worked with    my first lesson with fred was a reality check     she said     he told me that i needed to cut clean from my past  let things flow naturally  no one had ever told me that music was something i could do for myself     working with ms  washburn has furthered that feeling  she said  helping her embrace her roots on her own terms  for example  after doing some research  ms  wu wrote new lyrics for    wusuli boat song    to avoid the propagandist version popularized in china     and with abby     she said     i can share an innovative side of my culture that maybe isn   t well known     the acoustic planet tales series represents a homecoming for its curator  mr  fleck  he first picked up a banjo while growing up in an upper west side apartment  not far from symphony space     the stereotypes around the instrument didn   t relate to me     he said     i didn   t grow up in a rural setting  and i thought that banjo players could make any kind of music they pleased     his career to date  which includes    grammy awards while spanning several genres  proves that point mr  fleck will begin his series on friday  performing in a rare duet with the bassist of his flecktones band   victor wooten  he will close it on oct      sitting in a circle with  tony trischka  seamus egan and don vappie  for a    banjo roundtable    that embraces many styles and influences for mr  fleck  what makes such connections click  beyond masterly technique  are broad mindedness and intimacy  ms  washburn agrees  the magic of her collaboration with ms  wu  she said  results    partly from open tunings  but mostly from open minds   and the feeling of trust in a true friend
