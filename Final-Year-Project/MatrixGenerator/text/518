articles one driver can prevent a traffic jam           when you   re caught in a traffic jam  you feel powerless  what you may not know is that you can actually have a big effect on the traffic around you  there is a growing body of research finding that an individual driver  by preventing bottlenecks and maintaining a steady speed  can sometimes single handedly ease or break up a traffic jam  the techniques are simple  though some of them   such as leaving a large gap between your car and the one in front and freely letting other drivers cut in   feel counterintuitive to most drivers  seattle engineer  william beaty  a leading proponent of jam busting techniques for individual drivers  illustrated some of them on a ride through rush hour traffic  commuters in seattle spend an average    hours a year stuck in traffic  making it one of    u s  cities with the worst traffic  according to inrix  a transportation analytics company  traffic congestion is getting worse in many cities  even as desperate drivers take more active steps to avoid it with apps such as waze and google maps  as mr  beaty merges onto a crowded stretch of seattle   s i    he drives at a steady speed  keeping a space of several car lengths in front of him     as merging cars come in  i don   t have to slow down  which means that nobody behind me has to slow down     he says  as he nears an exit  two drivers on his left merge smoothly into the lane in front of him and exit without hitting the brakes meanwhile  the car behind him is just a few feet away     that   s the tailgating philosophy     he says     you push ahead  and you think if everybody would just push ahead  then everyone would go faster     he says  in fact     it just turns the road into a parking lot    as mr  beaty approaches a left hand exit into downtown seattle  the center lane is backed up as a few cars struggle to cross over to the exit     this jam is created by just a few drivers    getting trapped     he says     this is one of the places where an individual driver can wipe out a gigantic jam    by allowing cars to accelerate freely into your lane  he says mr  beaty  a    year old electrical engineer  has honed his techniques by trial and error  testing various maneuvers on his commute  but researchers at three chinese universities tested mr  beaty   s methods  which they labeled    jam absorption driving     and found they can prevent waves of congestion from forming in moving traffic  according to a study published in august  a separate study published last year by japanese researchers also found mr  beaty   s techniques could prevent jams under some conditions  mr  beaty   s recommendations  which he has posted on a website  trafficwaves org  have been cited in five peer reviewed academic studies  seattle residents who have seen his youtube videos frequently stop him in the street and ask     aren   t you the traffic wave guy     conducting experiments in physics  holography  biology and other fields is a favorite pastime for mr  beaty  a former science exhibit designer who has built robotic dinosaurs and earthquake simulators for museums  he has created his own lab  a rented space filled with half assembled gadgets  near his home in the funky georgetown area of seattle  mr  beaty says he has gotten as many as         hits a week on his main website  science hobbyist  his work is a popular source of project ideas among physics students and teachers  says  dan macisaac  an associate professor of physics at buffalo state college  part of the state university of new york  mr  beaty stresses that his observations about traffic aren   t new     these are things that traffic experts and long haul truckers have known forever     he says  formerly afflicted with road rage himself  he began experimenting with jam busting techniques years ago  during his    minute commute to his job as an engineer on the support staff at the university of washington   s chemistry department   his traffic research is unrelated to his day job   he noticed that traffic congestion forms in waves  like sand or water  and the smallest obstruction  such as one driver swerving or slowing briefly  could trigger a chain reaction of drivers hitting the brakes by trying various maneuvers  he found he could sometimes have the opposite effect  allowing backups to drain away     i saw the jams evaporate     he says  his techniques won   t work if you   re already locked in bumper to bumper traffic and can   t find anywhere to open a gap  mr  beaty says  also  some congestion is irreducible  when the volume of traffic exceeds the capacity of the road  it takes a while for his techniques to feel natural  mr  beaty acknowledges  and some drivers never see the point  he has been flamed on youtube and his own website by drivers who insist his techniques are wrong  on the highway  aggressive drivers sometimes race around him and fill the spaces he creates     your gut tells you you   re supposed to push ahead     he says  some scientists say mr  beaty   s observations are too imprecise to be useful  when a driver tries to maintain a gap between his car and the one ahead     there   s no way to predict exactly what will happen in the next minute  so you don   t know how much space you need     says  martin treiber  chair of the traffic modeling  econometrics and statistics department at germany   s dresden university of technology and a developer of traffic flow models illustrating causes and solutions for congestion  experts agree  however  that lane weavers   who force others to slam on the brakes   rubberneckers who pause to gawk at roadside distractions and tailgaters can single handedly back up traffic for miles     these are some of the really stupid reasons for traffic being bad     says  steven shladover  a manager at the partners for advanced transportation technology program at the university of california  berkeley  as traffic congestion gets worse  some government regulators are embracing traffic control tools based on the same principles as mr  beaty   s techniques  on ramp stop and go lights on some state highways force drivers to leave spaces in front of their cars  for example  and    zipper merge    rules require drivers in construction zones to open gaps in front of their cars so others can take turns merging smoothly like many traffic experts  dr  shladover uses some of mr  beaty   s techniques intuitively to smooth traffic flow  but he   s skeptical that many other drivers could be persuaded to do the same     selfishness takes hold  and people don   t necessarily think much about the common good     he says  eventually  if large numbers of self driving cars equipped to maintain uniform speeds and distances between cars take the road  he says     hopefully most of that nonsense will go away     driver education schools try to train students to stop tailgating  leave wide gaps between cars and take turns when merging  but    people have to unlearn what they   ve been taught    about standing in line  says  dave muma  president of the driving school association of the americas  a trade group     kids are trained at a very young age that they have to get in line and not let people cut in front of you      rules that work well on the playground but cause gridlock on the highway  says mr  muma  owner of a holland  mich   driver education company mr  beaty says seeing oneself as a jam buster has its own rewards     you   re above it all     he says     if you maintain big empty spaces  all these options open up  and you   re actually the superior driver     free to    be the person who holds the door open for others      write to sue shellenbarger at sue
