i don   t want to be an employeit   s too bad that you weren   t driving a cab in the days before uber and lyft  back when the taxi companies held all the cards  back when they   d put a driver out of service at the drop of a hat         changing your status in the computer and making it impossible for you to lease a cab to drive  and to make money with  back then  if you really pissed them off  you could be assured they   d make certain that no other taxi company in the city would touch you         you were finished i feel no more like uber   s partner than i felt like the taxi company   s partner  if cab drivers aren   t employees  then neither are uber drivers  it felt like the cab company had more power over me  my driving schedule  the requirement to pay the gate fee even if i was too sick to drive a scheduled shift  a specific cab assigned to me that i was required to drive  a dispatcher to obey  an operations manager to duck    in truth  no  i do not want to be an employee  i value my freedom and flexibility too much  and i like the opportunity to make as much as i can  rather than settling for an hourly wage  if i wanted a    real job     i   d go get one we   ve been on this shift too long
