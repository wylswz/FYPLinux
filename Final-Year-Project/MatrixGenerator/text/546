york     managers at u s companies tend to claim that they encourage workers to use their allotted vacation time but there s a widening gap between what managers say in what they actually do about

twenty two million at the     airport that had to go in there     it there     i found it     all employees working at the pursell volunteers for their players that are really are no winners and     their vacation     what is behind all this is and isn t an anti vacation culture built up bike gilts or pressure     and that is actually     kyle and i don t think an intentional thing i think it sort of happened organically over time     we don t talk about the kids in the workplace     or simply sitting next to nothing about it     and     when     the film that i lived     here during friday he left and that s what we ve done is it okay why not share     them there and had caution and over time     become     even though most people that we interview look at their managers returning to her incredibly positive thinking     but are believed to have fairly aligned with their behavior     what research was a study based on how many workers are managers did you interview were were interviewed     though the     anti vatican compare that to a seven hundred and we ll talk a lot of twelve hundred managers     typically     let s talk about managers for the study found

ten twelve am on the table though their above average in their new     the case and     i m going to be fired     and that we really are seeing that the thinking a little bit more pressure and continue to perform a decree     not only giving them and certainly attending a powerful message to their employees     and senior leaders katie of those caught between the c suite the rest of the company     were they the worst offenders they really feel the pressure of the workplace more than top executives     yet absolutely the concentration of her hair we identify a very good that the senior leaders to people with that     in obp senior director at the height of the report are in the week     begins where we can log jam of the year     they are more much more likely that a lot of filling up at anyone of you were the ability     to think of all you know issue completely and     for all of the     whole people that they feel really strongly     and when they re coming after only     have a trickle down to the rest of the company     was illegal and are some reasons why executives managers and non managers choose not to take time off     needed to understand where we live in an era where the work they can no longer play it at the state of being     we are on it     anytime you can always hear email thanking sometime get more of an innocent bystander indication of the green potentially try not to do     i think it s more something that he had a calendar held up to that     a really cool it would take time you almost can t because they can to protect the collector that don t     working     with an executive leadership group     if you don t take vacation and agreed that the picking and     let s take a minute left here which is     very thick african currently typing keynote the light that killed some of the pressures of the fears that the senior leaders are feeling really strong link     but they are making time in years to complete the continue     link and the kiddo to know what we don t talk about it     i can and should you care that people here really nothing about it     between the behavior of the queue and if you re in your leadership is not taking the keys and a half of the very powerful message to the rest of the employee pay     the senior leaders really feel the pressure more than half of them     cited one reason non are taking time off a fear of returning to a mountain of work     right that men and the     other thing that you can see it happening in real time on your phone you know you re going to have a lot to go back to     why didn t you before you leave enough trouble with the most important time for it to take them off     or having even when you get back     what are the more interesting perspective completely concrete inter korean     won and that to it     helping the year     here he was one of the people that look like a panic attack them and the connected and then ultimately you need to stop worrying and start testing your teen that he s not completely concur that can you believe that our protective and loving care that it could be     in life the occasion     you can help it enter perspective to come     back and think about the big picture     what s really important you making sure that we re still driving to the media before work     the report also highlighted the best practices for companies that understand in utilize vacation     and its impacts on company finances     i guess you mention to lloyd what about starbucks was in starbucks another company     the that with the little that of an apparently hadn t heard that one before but     what happened with the help of the the the the the the the mean time for leisure well here in italy     that the nineteen eighty three weeks older and have a copy of the craftsmanship of the of protecting the community of like the kind of haircut living room feel     any of that that that that could lead to the tothe to really     the modern day visitors about the quinoa today     with something they wouldn t buy here that i have a trip to europe in italy     he was just the big takeaway from this how can     the majority of companies who are struggling with this issue follow these companies like starbucks and eloise that have really set a good example is far is using vacation time     a tremendously powerful rule if a company to use it     to the hugely important that in the territory     the great american power to give them a competitive advantage     i think you know that we need to create a medical compared to
