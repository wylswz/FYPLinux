articles the birth of a nation review a struggle to match its fiery subject           movies can   t be viewed in a vacuum and few filmmakers  ordinarily  would want them to be  take  nate parker   s    the birth of a nation     an ambitious  rage fueled historical drama  it relies to a great extent on a viewer   s familiarity with  nat turner  the antebellum embodiment of existential white terror  the slave whose      rebellion left an estimated    white virginians dead  and     blacks slain by whites in retaliation   the movie   s considerable tension relies on a knowledge and fear that there is slaughter to come  its title   especially for those aware it   s been lifted from  d w  griffith   s notorious      masterpiece   is an advertisement of the film   s defiance  irony and implicit critique of hollywood   s dismal race history  many viewers will know all this  the director hoped they would they   ll also know that mr  parker won the two top awards at the sundance film festival this year  where his film sold for an unheard of       million to distributor fox searchlight  and they   ll likely be aware that  along with a movie  searchlight bought itself a pile of trouble  rape   which not only fuels but justifies much of the anger behind the film   s retributive violence   is the same crime of which mr  parker was accused some years ago  when he was a student athlete at penn state university for the marketing people  it   s a catastrophe  for armchair psychologists  it   s christmas and new year   s  and for some ticket buyers  it will means a moral quandary  mr  parker was  after all  acquitted of the alleged attack  though his    birth of a nation    writing partner   jean mcgianni celestin  was imprisoned following a conviction for sexual assault  a conviction later overturned   their accuser  after what reportedly were some troubled years  killed herself in      no  the movie can   t escape its maelstrom of bad pr  and reviews aren   t written in a vacuum either  but lest the point get lost  what mr  parker has committed to the screen is a righteously indignant  kinetic and well acted film   mr  parker  as turner  delivers a fierce  complex performance  at the same time  his film is remarkably conventional  the framing and the camera movements are all very routine  even dated  one would have said it looks like television  before television gained its current lustre  mr  parker   s approach to narrative development is to gallop through sequences with his viewer hanging from the back of the figurative buckboard no one wants to be distracted from the core turner story by a lot of cinematic flamboyance  of course  but some stylistic coherence would have been welcome   more welcome  certainly  than  henry jackman   s score  which doesn   t lead a viewer by the hand as much as it drags him along by the ankle    the birth of a nation    is more restrained in its re creation of bloody barbarity than  say        years a slave     in his refashioning of the turner story  mr  parker seems to have gone to  thomas r  gray   s         confessions of nat turner     not the      pulitzer winner by  william styron   seeking parallels to contemporary race relations  and creating characters whose reactions to the horrors around them are more like our own than those of people for whom slavery was a daily reality but this doesn   t conflict with what seems mr  parker   s main objective  a measuring of the intellectual leap slave holding interests had to make in justifying an unholy institution  while using religion to do it in this  mr  parker falls a bit short  in his gripping confession from jail  the real life turner reputedly told gray he was visited by divine voices     the spirit that spoke to the prophets in former days      in the film  he is recognized while still a child   tony espinosa  as having intellectual and spiritual gifts  elizabeth turner   penelope ann miller   the mother of nat   s owner  samuel turner  armie hammer   detects genius in the boy and brings him into the house  it will be turner   s familiarity with the gospels  his talents as a preacher and his relatively sheltered upbringing that lead to his epiphanies hard times prompt samuel to hire out the adult nat as a preacher for pay   his job is to mollify local slaves with scripture     slaves  obey your earthly masters with respect and fear  and with sincerity of heart  just as you would obey christ     ephesians        it   s a fatal error  on one plantation  nat sees workers literally being starved to death  on another  a hunger striker has his teeth chiseled out to facilitate a force feeding  as the slave   s mouth is pried open  so are nat   s eyes  he perceives for the first time not only the hypocrisy of using the bible to sanctify violence  but the futility of words themselves it   s a critical aspect of turner   s evolution   another is the rape of his wife  cherry  aja  naomi king   which occurs  mercifully  off screen at the hands of a gang led by a terrifying slave hunter   jackie earle haley   but mr  parker   s spiritual disillusionment is not quite pursued  or at least explained  the fact that turner will use inflated  biblical language to justify himself   as he unleashes his bloodthirsty band on those sleeping virginians   renders the movie   s thinking opaque what makes mr  parker   s turner a perfectly dramatic hero  though  is the fact that he is both victim and avenger  the educator and educated  his enlightenment includes the recognition of his own exploitation  for all the flaws in the film  it   s important to know about nat turner  to have him on screen  it   s important to be reminded  now and then  that humans are capable of resisting monolithic evil  what   s unfortunate  of course  is that at a time when race and sex are such a contentious factors in american cinema  the few virtues of    the birth of a nation    will be all but buried in bad press the less than enlightened  woodrow wilson described it as    writing history with lightning     but d w  griffith   s landmark silent film is very much about d w  griffith   his southern heritage  his inherited loathing of black emancipation  his distorted view of the ku klux klan  but it   s also a seminal work of cinema  and one whose cast included a number of directors to be   among them  john ford  raoul walsh and  jules white  the three stooges   mr  anderson is a critic in new york  joe morgenstern is on vacation
