articles okeeffe stettheimer torr zorach women modernists in new york review            west palm beach  fla   and portland  maine  why devote an exhibition to    women    modernists  for centuries  female artists have fought to be taken seriously as just    artists     without any modifier that could be seen as limiting     o   keeffe  stettheimer  torr  zorach  women modernists in new york     organized by the norton museum of art in west palm beach  fla   and now on view at the portland museum of art in maine  is premised on the view that gender limited the careers of these four   deemed    some of the most significant modernists in american history      and attempts to provide the exposure that might lift them into the western art canon  the show presents about    works  dated      through       when the rise of modernism gave artists license to experiment with new styles and vocabularies   florine stettheimer               helen torr               marguerite zorach             and georgia o   keeffe             knew one another  lived for a time in the same city  had overlapping careers and faced many of the same obstacles as other women of their day  but the exhibition doesn   t quite work as advertised or intended  the talents and personal situations of the four vary vastly  and that affected their reputations as much as the prejudices held against them  and all difficulties aside  o   keeffe is today a household name  while stettheimer   s reputation has been rising ever since her      retrospective at the whitney museum  the other two are known mainly within the art world  partly because of their own choices  so showing these four together doesn   t illuminate much about art history  at the norton  after an introductory gallery  each artist was showcased in her own gallery  providing little incentive for viewers to compare and contrast  portland  working in a different space  reshuffled the works thematically   juxtaposing domestic scenes by all four  floral scenes  landscapes and the like to show the many faces of modernism   but that didn   t help  o   keeffe and torr explored similar ground  but it was torr   s brilliant husband   arthur dove  who maintained a dialogue with o   keeffe that led to their imaginative  lyrical strain of modernism   ellen e  roberts  the norton curator who originated the exhibition  sees torr as a partner in that exchange   but there is little documentation to back her up  meanwhile  stettheimer forged her own  very idiosyncratic style  and the talented zorach seems more in sync with french colleagues  zorach  having moved to paris in       when fauvism was all the rage  was among the first americans to experiment with its bold colors and forms  here    les baux           captures the drama of a landscape rather than its precise features  in    untitled     c        she turns abstract circles  diagonal rays and tree trunks into an enchanted forest     provincetown  sunrise and moonset           is a resplendent mix of expressionism  cubism and futurism  she also painted daring nudes and flat  patterned figurative works  but zorach had not devised a singular style when  two years after paintings by her in the      armory show were noted for their    extreme modernity     she started a family  with little time to paint   and putting the career of her artist husband  william  first   she turned to embroidery and other textile arts  they are worthy and  this exhibition declares  a contribution to modernism  but they are still mostly viewed by art historians as women   s art  what zorach might have accomplished  had she not curtailed her painting  is unknowable  making it hard to accept the exhibition   s bullish claim for her  torr might not have had a career at all were it not for dove  who worked side by side with her on their houseboat and boosted her confidence  their work   meditations on the natural world   is similar  though torr is a bit more figurative than her husband  as seen in    oyster stakes            which shows two markers in a sea whose waves mimic the clouds  if only she had created more works like    purple and green leaves            an oil abstraction painted on copper that shimmers with luminosity  stettheimer is the most eccentric of this group  independently wealthy  she never married but still resented the social obligations that stole time from her painting  her humorous  flowing style played with perspective  mixed bright colors with unexpected pastels  and sometimes referred to other artists     jenny and genevieve     c        portrays a bored woman moping at a table and attended by a black maid   a nod to  manet   s    olympia    set in a decorative background worthy of  matisse she is most appreciated for her witty narratives  like    picnic at bedford hills            which depicts her and her sisters sprawling on a yellow lawn   parasols askew   attended by  marcel duchamp and the sculptor  elie nadelman  in    spring sale at bendel   s            she satirizes upper middle class shoppers  who vie for bargains  practically leaping over one another  always  her details   a fat chicken  the veiled hats   are delicious o   keeffe   s works offer the fewest revelations   just a well chosen array of flower  cityscape  landscape and skull paintings  plus a charcoal drawing     special no                that was among those prompting  alfred stieglitz  later her husband  to say    finally a woman on paper     as the most important modern dealer of his day  he gave her entr  e to the art world  yet it   s worth noting that o   keeffe  who has secured a place in art history  most clearly fought back against the gender stereotypes imposed on her by art critics  she freed herself to concentrate on art by moving to new mexico  away from them  stettheimer held herself back  hesitating to exhibit her work  and until recently paid a price for that reticence  this exhibition will reinforce her rise  zorach and torr  both products of their era  seem likely to remain minor figures in the canon  even after this new exposure  despite the array of interesting  even fascinating  paintings here  the history of american modernism remains unchanged     ms  dobrzynski writes about culture for many publications and blogs at www artsjournal com realcleararts
