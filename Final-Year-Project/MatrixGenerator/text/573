bret stephens and mary kissel     well welcome back to another edition of foreign edition and bret stephens in new york city in our studios     in the chair where mary kissel usually sets     there s nobody because she is joining me on the line from little rock     where she continues to pursue     our investigation into the whitewater scandal mary we will never let you will never let go of this     were were were now on volume set     that s right i m investigating whitewater     when an applicant s allegation and etiquette cheese crackers with     i have successfully found that to happen to think that it would never     be a demented season practice first whitewater second in the meantime     let s     let s take stock of some of the big international stories     of the week     by far the biggest it seems to me mary was     the rejection     the surprise rejection on sunday     by the people of colombia     least the voters in colombia     of the peace deal     that     presidents on its hosts had     over the space of four years meticulously negotiated     with the leaders of the far the     holdout marxist narco terrorists     guerrilla movement     that has terrorized the colombian people since nineteen sixty four     contributed to the deaths of close to two hundred and fifty thousand people     this deal was arranged i think in august     in the was concluded in august     polls     showed the dead     on     colombians would vote in favor of the deal despite some     misgivings about the concessions that it made     an lol the pools were     dead wrong by a narrow margin of fifty thousand votes fifty point two percent     of colombians     led by the former president of the early read it     said no to the deal it said is um     i think it s pretty much the end of this article said ministrations although he vows to     continue trying to negotiate something     aam but     did colombians choose wisely     well i don t think it could split the vote they can     be i think it with the boat that can be that     the deal     issued the colombian had it not that old but a giveaway that the top of the demonstration     which willing to fork over     to the car and i m glad he cited some of the numbers because     he can get in the long running terrorist that war     i think human polls     and colombian simply were not willing to be     kept amnesty for many of the bikers     i e in their legislative body     i in in other parts of the deal which simply i think in the minds of many of them went too far in you know and the poll     but the thing that     popped up during property     ay ay eu eu can never under estimate the wisdom of the average worker     in a democracy and the ivy read the account     except in primaries that so     it     can help     i think that the voters are we really need something in in in the in the referendum     and what they re telling you in colombia     is that there s no if they want     to     but that are     primed to the park committed     it is not the right deal     and they were persuaded by the argument that the rebate     and i don t know if it can go back to the people in pension if they do i think they probably need a new government to do it the harder one from just a sort of some bring our     audience up to speed     the     yield on the stocks     at the beginning of this     century     one had made major advances in colombia he was killing people     in the streets of major colombian cities it wasn t just in the jungles     thanks to     a plan colombia     which was initiated by the clinton ministrations     and then pursued by the     bush administration and thinks above all to the leadership of president lee the former president of the the     columbia managed to deal so of the year military blows to the far can bring it will eat the edge     of i m feeling certainly to shrink its footprint in the colombian jungle     school fraction of what they had once     been and it was from that position of strength the president s articles     assumed office     and began to negotiate     this agreement under the auspices of the castro regime in havana which tells you something but the deal     it took four long years and among the concessions that the cycles government made     was to promise that it would not     put rank and file far     i m fighters into jail     that its leaders would be sentenced to no more than community     community service not to long     prison set     of     sentences     that fark leaders would also have     a a an allotment of seats     in the colombian congress that this is a guaranteed seats irrespective of     of the vote     having many colombians     basically says to borrow a phrase no justice no peace     were these no justice no peace deal become the fark and had wrecked such terrible violence against colombian people     kidnap so many people murdered so many people that were so many relatives of their victims in colombia     that the column interesting hey you know we ve basically won this war     and yet there to know when this peace deal     because our president is so eager     not the words and is now but so eager for the nobel peace prize     that he s willing to     first sake the     those grievances of of his own people for the sake of this hastily arranged oh     and by the way you know as with all these guerrilla movements that will negotiate     their way into government     there s always some breakaway group     that s willing     to not accept a deal     i continue with the guerrilla warfare continue with the terrorist tactics while their former comrades take advantage of the levers of government     and our colleague mary o grady pointed out that this was something that happened     effectively in     el salvador and central america in the nineteen nineties     and now all salvador as president as a former leader of their own     version of the fark their own     marxist     terrorist guerrilla group     so     cohen has i think what he wants to turn this to the question now is is you put it     mary     where do we go     from     here i don t think the fark is going to take up arms     but there does have to be a new government in me even need     to be some lessons learned     about the perils     of     trying to bring terrorists it s a government trying to make them     legitimate     on the basis of promises are not entirely sure the gimmicky     and all but a day or two about what the are at fault in it which is basically a programming group yet to make money and vacation in cuba     i and you know it opposed it and you know some of the revolutionary guard but that that really not what they are     and in     the truck     and in all that i m glad you brought up the heat comparison with other latin american country     i d i d i think we should all to know what happened in peru with their care for patients     have     been through basically     up on it it s not that i m advocating for columbia     but take a break them out a candle     that it did that     it just goes to show that you are a     play     on the i m not advocating that and it s just that     aam but the company to you you do need to go into the area     and if they re not going away     the turnover their arms     um in in aachen and negotiate i can hear you hafta take stronger measures     and i think that that     summing it all mean to     pick her     delta don t think that they re going to come to any other time to heal     without everyday and its allies     somehow being part of it because i think that     but in the bowl a large part of what it was all the headlines     on the top ten     and a weak support and     everyone in the line is somewhere     in the field helping negotiate if the teacher is the key     to improve human samples instructed not least because     of the peruvian economy has been a bright     star in south america ever since they     destroyed     the fark     one     of the story you mention in terms of them in the government this would be the biggest fujimori government back in the nineteen nineties     our main     arming the people     isn t so much said that it s it s injustice which can often be     which can often not can be no justice at all     but it does illustrate the point     that contrary to the claims it s in their own mean or so to speak     for the indigenous     or rural parts of the peruvian population     the terrorists     those parts of the population they terrorize those parts of the population     and     will was so effective     um     about     the     of what fujimori dead     is that he     gave the line politically to send their elaine also xclaim signing announced plans     to being the     voice of the people they were anything     they were anything but that     um and i think it s the same is true with a far as you put that     these people are revolutionaries     these people are     drug gangsters     with     avis stitch all     marxist rhetoric     which     hides their     high in the     commercially developed     and clearly developed markets     so that women take a break     and will come back with um other defeats     diplomatic and     more     um     ok the max     love this show check out of is by visiting wsj dot com slashed podcast fear full selection and or programs     from the opinion pages of wall street journal     this is     for an edition     now from our studios in new york     bret stephens and mary kissel     welcome back to foreign edition     john kerry     who was mary kissel s favorite secretary snow     i     john kerry has announced     that he did that the united states     will not     be you     are trying to bring russia     going with russia in trying to arrange a diplomatic solution in syria     this is after the russians continued to press     their advantage     militarily in the siege of aleppo where there are two hundred and seventy five     fouls and civilians     trapped     under fire     um     the us of course small     deal anything else for syria are america s policy in the country is now     having officially     as much     a shambles as much a wreck as the city of aleppo itself     but we re no longer can be taught him to the russian so there     just goes to show those russians that i m     that kind of bad behavior isn t going to get you into a nice dinner time conversation john kerry     a mansion and that the feeling in the kremlin and in the russian foreign ministry     must be one of complete relief     and exaltation and     that they don t     have to     receive john kerry     perhaps never again as secretary of state     going for as long as you     go in     there and take it it it carefully in a while     aam very     very good film the     day     when the winning the     toss the russian in any kind of dialogue     in the first place     um let s recall how many years ago now it why is that     it     started invading his neighbor s     eye toward ukraine and     the cyberattack and the baltic     i it might be at the time i know who was coming into the area     at the non an actor     would always read if you live on it today     and so i came up with gary is doing by walking away from the people     in its perspective     he     is trying to rescue the court     will likely be whatever remained black     guy named steve upright at the with the people i would strongly to the perman principle     of course is     complete bull     because the very really had a principal     he would have quit when he made the case for forcing the red line in syria     back in twenty     oh     the     he didn t     not being a mouthpiece for the impala policy     now he finds himself     and at brick wall that was entirely predictable     and the trying to paint it did in no time turning it that you can sign of     weakness i love the word scramble to slow the mines they are very favorite words and     and along with the words cyclists it s wanna have so many occasions to use when describing the obama administration s     foreign     policy     you know     kerry was     quoted     to have a conversation last month on the edges of the un     the un has the     conference here in new york     and he had a conversation with some syrian dissidents humanitarian relief workers     in which he said you know i was one of those guys who was really arguing for     military for some and lost that argument so really i m on your side it s a scary     doing something     that terry watchers are familiar with     basically telling     audiences privately that he is privately on     their side     which is     a lie that tends to catch up     to people very quickly but it s important to remember     that when     the obama administration have an unofficial     policy of quarantining     russia     after it is that given the silent edward snowden after it and sees crimea and then invaded ukraine     he was carrying coup in may of twenty fifteen     aam broke a quarantine i believe that she to the annoyance of the white house     flying to sochi to     have a discussion with live roth and live near sergei lavrov foreign minister and flatten your     putin s     it was kerry who kept pushing for a cease fire one in january it quickly fell apart than the one     that fell apart in sydney last year     he was kerry who pushed the pentagon to share sensitive     targeting intelligence with the russia     as a condition of the cease fire or part of the ceasefire     and now carries the one who says well i knew all all all along that the russians that     can be trusted     the other thing that infuriates me know he     is     audience members of a longer memory will     remember     that the shots and had no better friend in washington     then     senator john f kerry     when he sat on as the ranking member in fact as the head     of the senate foreign relations committee     all the way up until january twenty thirteen     and remember to     get it would appear in a     um you mad at god and why on the cover     of     american magazine show     them who left broadly thank you anna wintour     a anna wintour in     their shares     on an a and in it he he he can     get to     know the whole     of god that this regime why     to wit and knowledge is power power range     there are     now minority groups around them so you know in a figurehead position in government that terrorized in general in the popular     and how you know it     the key     largely patients in the group     one of the revolution started     um it lifted the kind of     extremists them on to the tide on the shia side     inordinately to the birth of i the     eye the the dropper a straight line     from the syrian     uprising and in the a side crackdown     the disorder in the middle east can write to write this     i tube     i don t think you would of had it to such degree     were it not for the chaos in syria and it is on the phone and it s it s on obama said the sun sure john kerry s     and mary     it will be remembered as the signature legacy     of the obama administration s foreign policy     aleppo     is to the obama administration and why um the city of     way is     to the times has made in the administration it is a monument     to     their failure     um     actually it s worse because we we took one     in nineteen sixty one never can retake     or take a look     but some     let s finish the year by talking about     our last defeat of the day     um     and and really really as swear after the election folks were going to     where to find positive things to talk about maybe not     maybe it will have to wait another     twenty years     um     the new secretary general of the united     nations there s been an election to replace     the ban ki moon the largely     colorless south korean diplomat     who has occupied the position since two thousand and     two thousand and seven     and     after a long boat we had advocated strongly for serbia s former foreign minister who euro mitch     who     was the only guy there who seem to believe in     the     administrative reform and     democracy     instead we re going to get on the twenty oh one terrorists the former prime minister socialist prime minister of portugal     who     in recent more more recently has been     the u n s     high commissioner for refugees running that     side of the un agency     um     could of been worse     oh boy am     i     the only way i have been worse if you ve got to go back and it lagged in reno     on top     simply because they wanted     a woman in arabic that they haven t had a woman and i wanted to back up     the symbolic return but but but today i think that that that that that s respect for the united nations     and when you click here and     in any form are socialistic portuguese leader     aam     who did     very little to help the growth and prosperity that home country     and did very little to help the cause of reform     in the united nations securely at the head     of the rescue kitty each of the week     my understanding that maybe you can jump in here     aam was a pretty poorly managed and i think that that     what s interesting here is that it     was only earlier this year that the un zone in them     internal     the inspector general whatever other observers inspector general s     too well this tv report about the management of     the     it s of the refugee agency this is this is the un of course as     two agencies for refugees one of which deals exclusively with palestinians on rock     and the other is an agency for every other refugee in the world of very typical of the un     he was in that     larger agency and there was this scathing report about the fact that the agency had     no financial controls didn t know really where the money was going had     had dubious relationships with outside vendors who did     not     vetted properly like you re saying to yourself hmm     so you can have these reports     of course nobody is going to read them except for maybe it s a few cranky editorial writers that the wall street journal who have nothing better to do than     spend the late evenings reading you when     you when     documents     and didn t elevate him to make a secretary general of an organization that is infamous     for its     weak internal controls and bureaucratic mismanagement     an infamous tool for being a     an agent     of opposition to free markets capitalism democracy     and everything else that makes the world a better     place     this seems to me totally mad more than     you know the you when you still buy by principle of     regional rotation in terms of where it s secretary general s     came from     so     they had to um you know the ban ki moon because     the was asia s turn to have a secretary general     before that they had to secretary general s kofi an on     and his     predecessor butchers pietro s golly representing     africa before that     south american improving diplomatic so forth and so on     they violated the principle in order to get     a guy whose name recommendation was having mismanaged     his last     big     post and it shows that that there is     no interests are having the obama administration to handle things on the part of anyone at the one     to actually have a properly administered organization so in the same year that the un admits that its own peacekeepers     killed     thousands of people in the team by creating a cholera epidemic in the wake of the two thousand and ten     earthquake women desperately need a better run organization     they re gonna put him and that the joke was     that that in the top job     was no obvious qualifications for the people also forget that i m the secretary general     is not to swan around in international meetings and give his blessings to this or that bad the steel like a     secular poll     the job is to be the chief administrative officer of the is a very large and often lavishly funded organization     he i knew mentioned on a pony     tail wind to the killing of all the people in haiti the     heat to serving the mass in the united nations today     on the former head of     the cattle stomach     but it would under would be prosecuted or brought until he killed the dog in the back peddling away to enact     some months ago     back at the heart of the it ministrations of the un     all the oil for food scandal that our editorial page covered at length     aam which was just the beginning of human problems     aam you have to go to the lack of any kind of protection with a minute you keep the organization you have an allocation of     real atrocities rape     looking in all of the rat     who did not to the dominican administration of the united nations because it could top that     urgently     need a reformer     and i in it i m i m very disappointed that     the computer air america she said     at that period last year the guy who actually had the courage to come out and say     what people     are not broken     and i d like to worry about how to fix the problems in     years     the list of the forty or fifty items that i m proposing to do     it even had a made up to a professional     the finder it with you when your carriers open to all     i     for tickle     i went to

agreement is that old phones were     in the us     um it s not the theory     that not a serious person in the end i     don t think even if he wanted to     heat up to the chaos     that require great now if you want the un     to survive     the utensils in the us     rbs     with that we re gonna be agu     due     thanks for tuning     into this     foreign edition     for more podcast
