paper in banking and insurance to fund which east of the open     source the loss of up to     image is a nihilist come documentation     the institutions meets the need to deal with side     i think     what we are right now     is that light the self is     the concept is is really     the pasta     is now the digit one clown     taken place     digitizing and     putting into the system for some benefit to the business i know sad to benefit the customer     as well     the most interesting from a     and so into institutions     is that what i m told that the banks in town on to the european country     thus a bushel biggest technological challenge     she sits in a     that would lead     it s not mobility     it s not online bank angle     aam nick rate season pass and new and a basic services     but are really bugging following the white paper     and the role causation     anything that can be done to try for to stop a few     things to come in quite well     how this for j c penney to help reduce this     um i think a somewhat different ways     first and foremost it s about reducing costs so with cooking taipei reducing     amounts of paper that required     on tomahawk is no the upcoming conceivable was     and is in the and barman was that     by saying the insurance compass to help racing     reducing costs that s     written imperative     for the last six is about snow cutting chai ange     it     boasts a call to the account is not just about speaking up costs     it s about becoming more efficient in sums the price that says     that if all its     parent s home prices says     amanda exo princesses as well that by rep lee     i didn t directly     impact customers     the sydenham of the customer     user experience     if you want to bring new customers on board and was saying that s a lot to do things on retail banking     ultra competitive trying to get hold of new customers displacing them to move from one bank to another     you want to make the prices of onboarding     as easy as possible producing an ounce of paper making a much wilson straight through     the     process     as was the cup of other elements one is the case in the     paper mallinson     bathhouse it causes and effects of corporate social responsibility     that s difficult in the pile     in recent years the so the green agenda     has that the time to shop and find     some other promising this piece found itself in but it s still important to demonstrate     his aunts wanted cheese paper to try to pray for green credentials     i just nine of the most important point     which is around the whole thing around compliance forty its regulations     what we found was     that as a result of the industry crises     was the princess is that we fold will be well followed well documented     in fact one dawn s     and safety can demonstrate her regulates the critical for the free home prices has helped him and says you write with some demonstrate fall for that purpose is     that everything is actually impossible     without spray was going to be keeping a     positive message was to     be calm     this is of the industry     politicians who are interested and so the     on the masses     what he thinks on the     dow would agree with alex think at this causation and present information and     services     and we estimate around six enough to send the revenues to spend on paper it appears prices said anything do treat you see that paper     i made the purchases or fishing is great     i m against reinforce what if s i ran the whole counted in process     surfers awful right now if if we just     digitize and     replaced it with a british the picture     the benefits that there s not much of its     former tried to distance the intelligence of the paper     to make sure the we can support for the kids on the advisor control     which or if we can understand     that they turn on a piece of identification     we can then perhaps so called advisor biderman chicken is about a possible twelve hour drive from sites which use the massive fraud     and really heading to palm are among the most from choosers     reducing paper entries are welcome farmers     in regions that are pertinent senate digital means that we can get the right     information to the right person at the right time     it takes that individual in terms of the red cross sanctions they comprise pfizer and one     it also helps them     i guess for the pic rex ordered compliance trial i m putting     my milk prices on top of     that work to make sure they re in the fall in compliance     is is is at simon dissidents to most employees are trying to was my that is is onto something we can do it digitization     i mean finally the last debate just trying to achieve complete something if the scare factor if its refining and its use of state     summit she s interested in a row and their demands     so so that we use to talk so wanted to be more efficient     the question is how     when the stasi to look at it with     the thickest isolation of paper     is about stopping somewhere efficiencies can be     lifted because we are guessing     the right information to the right people     in the short time as possible     to my wasted time     i think over talking about is     a science or anchoring the aggravation of marginal guidance to quickly achieve that goal     we like to     because she was talking about acting together lots of     small improvements     i m and put together the chris a big improvement     but financially operationally     and in the last customer     the selloff of companies to think about when digitizing their workplace     um     the thing that went to stella s that it s     once they saw see how that they ve     managed to sustain progress     it s the wealthiest that     i think is most important point which is choose the right     upper with which to work     publishers have of course     these places that my undergoing technology     um but perhaps also a good partner ecosystem     on this while     i think it s not just a     ton of a     cup of this     um simple relationship it should be at the hall and that was the strategic     relationship     there should be discussions around the various options that can be followed in times of     all sorts of services for top spot where     the most appropriate     it really is up to the vendor to get to educate the customer as the faults of the of the possible     side it was ten bucks a minute aam form of life within the banking sector to be looking for a vendor that scope the credit limits the scope study that then it s the     it s a bite me on this it s nice to dying     but most significantly cry with me     in the future     i was hp fit in with this     so in exactly that the latter distinction     hp offers a match princess coup for when guests who but at     the provides that that infrastructure     how s that work     the best part is that the nice be fit for purpose people still began reprinting degree of of of of basic     and imaging and printing     so this person will focus on his enjoyment would optimize the greens environment for the purchase and consume any optimizer to the timing of     the time     but     i guess in essence that the missing ingredient on as an all round for the digital works to enable     you to     think of you is that you need to digitize is early in the process as you possibly can mountain centralizing     sunnis make chew would push digitization the coolness of the business     and every stitch infrastructure     to start the digitization process     saw second     wait a few of them gases to go back     to work for     opportunities     and incrementally leverage that infrastructure to enable some additional work     if i come back and i think the sun results it s not just about selling technology     to technologists     it s about setting     business solutions old in business outcomes     which is unique among this time     the princess s     up by     an insurer follow this     um it s not just about sign here is a nice new prints they can do all of these things will pockets then i will see you in a few months  time only comes these maintenance     it s a much more strategic rush for my friday relationship     the facts     what kind of accent on and on investments     have the customer expects to gain from an     intimate scene hp menace princes he s     set to begin benefits into areas as the infrastructure benefits them and we can set the pc savings between ten and six percent on home kill printing costs     the big benefits are in the in the western areas     it is difficult to get his precise ounces freeze the deep end zone on the business process that time towards my     but results when going processing     are expenses that would reduce the cycle time i held it takes to     beat a cap on and the spots by twenty percent     i m in reducing costs associated with that market swings that in an eighteen percent     the real cost savings and i think in the world for area that swimmers the savings can be achieved     because of a sewage     infrastructure in place     and incrementally improving one s for hong kong fireworks were     than those savings on command and and come out of the time     i m     the irony is seeking a security risks around scanning and contain this issue in the mix is already common explained that this is a different viewpoint now this is not just a standalone fetching coffee     what talking about is using these multi function devices as intention that with devices that are part of the work for     we use this time about the digital maps     endorsement successful
