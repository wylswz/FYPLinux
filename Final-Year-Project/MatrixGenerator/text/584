 when meryl streep steps from her limousine onto the red carpet in london   s leicester square  everything about her comportment   as she strikes poses with castmates hugh grant and simon helberg  greets fans along the stanchions and hugs past co stars like stanley tucci who   ve turned out for her   announces that she   s been here before     it   s quite a scene  isn   t it     she later says about the glittery film premiere     it doesn   t get old  i mean  who gets to see a movie with       people    with her hair in an elegant but simple updo  streep confidently strides the red carpet in a black silk jumpsuit  heeled ankle boots and a long  beaded statement necklace  as she reaches the entrance to the theater  the emcee for the event introduces the star of florence foster jenkins to a cheering crowd  he then asks her     we know you can sing  because we heard you sing in mamma mia  so how difficult is it to sing badly    she smiles     surprisingly easy    streep does not hit a false note at the premiere   until the film rolls  inside the theater  the crowd watches as the actress appears on screen bedecked in jewels  fur and a tiara as florence foster jenkins  an eccentric socialite who fancied herself an opera singer and whose peculiar career culminated in a legendary      performance at carnegie hall that sold out within two hours when i sit down with streep and the film   s director  stephen frears  later at a photo studio in london   s camden town  streep describes jenkins   s pursuit of her dream in noble  artistic terms     there   s that great vincent van gogh quote     i am seeking  i am striving  i am in it with all my heart     that   s the aspiration     the self styled soprano had another thing in common with the dutch painter  she famously lacked an ear   she also lacked rhythm  tone and any self awareness about her singing ability   history remembers jenkins   s screeching  caterwauling voice in superlative terms     the world   s worst singer     even so  many who snickered or guffawed upon hearing jenkins would come around to applaud her     she seems to have known the pleasure people got     frears says of jenkins     there was laughter  and she seems not to have minded    both streep and frears  the    year old director of my beautiful laundrette  dangerous liaisons and philomena  proudly point out that florence foster jenkins is an homage to studio pictures from the      s and      s  yet there was something undeniably viral  or proto viral  about jenkins   s popularity in her day  her singing has the infectious exuberance of today   s amateur renditions of adele   s    hello    or the    evolution of dance    videos on youtube  where jenkins   s few extant recordings   including a sublime massacre of mozart   s queen of the night aria and a dumbfounding version of    adele   s laughing song    from strauss   s die fledermaus   can be heard today jenkins was born in       in wilkes barre  pennsylvania  to a family of means   her father made his fortune in railroads and banking  forbidden from pursuing a career in music by her father  she rebelled  eloping with dr  frank thornton jenkins  the union didn   t last long  but its aftereffects   he gave her syphilis   colored the rest of her life  in       the same year jenkins   s father died and she came into her inheritance  she met st  clair bayfield  a shakespearean actor from england who became her common law husband as well as her publicist and manager  jenkins launched her singing career in her   s  using her wealth to underwrite her passion    she had this need for attention     says donald collup  who wrote and produced the      documentary florence foster jenkins  a world of her own     she had to be the focus     this was true as she staged  with bayfield   s help  a series of recitals   many under the auspices of the verdi club  a private organization she founded   that became must see events for new york society  according to a newspaper clipping about one of jenkins   s      performances     the audience  as mrs  jenkins    audiences invariably do  behaved very badly  in the back of the hall men and women in full evening dress made no attempt to control their laughter     jenkins   s performances were  according to collup  akin to    the first rounds of american idol  where performers who have no business singing get up and think they   re great and make fools of themselves  the general public always watches those rounds   because they   re funny    frears   s film synthesizes the last several years of jenkins   s life  initially  she   s insulated from critical reviews as bayfield  portrayed with poker faced aplomb by hugh grant  handpicks her audience and pays reporters to write sycophantic reviews  but after one of her recordings becomes unexpectedly popular and finds its way onto the radio  jenkins decides to stage a concert for her adoring public  her fans eventually included cole porter and enrico caruso   the movie traces the singer   s growing desire to seek out the spotlight  set against bayfield   s increasingly tortuous efforts to keep her from being scorched by it   culminating in the carnegie hall concert  where she   s greeted with hails of laughter and repeated curtain calls in the decades following her death one month after the concert  jenkins amassed a cult following  among her admirers  barbra streisand and david bowie   jenkins   s performance remains one of the most requested from the concert hall   s archives   except it was never recorded     you get asked about benny goodman  the beatles  judy garland   florence is right up there with them     says gino francesconi  director of the archives and rose museum at carnegie hall     all the things she did in her life led up to this  she was    and making her carnegie hall debut  why didn   t she record or photograph the concert  it   s so odd    it   s easy to see jenkins   s need to perform as an expression of her ego  or even narcissism  her given name was narcissa florence foster   too easy  according to streep  who views jenkins as deeply insecure  not simply overcome with delusions of grandeur   though she grants the latter might be part of jenkins   s appeal     it   s also our prurient interest in other people   s vanity     streep says     imagining that it has nothing to do with our own    as played by streep  jenkins is driven by a force more powerful than vanity  as if her entire life   simultaneously privileged and tragic  with the specter of death a constant companion   was animated by the joy of singing     her personal challenges     streep says of her alter ego     what was stalking her in her life  made her make a decision to live every second deeply  intensely and to her joy    that  in turn  drove streep   s decision to make this movie     to choose the one that chooses joy   and there are a lot of reasons to go and to explore the endless dystopian vortex into nihilism   is saying     music matters  love matters     what   s the value in being alive right now  it   s saying     there is value     that   s in there     and in some ways the film ultimately functions as an expression of streep   s outlook on life and art   the spiritual child of mamma mia and the hours  and the apotheosis of the devil wears prada star   s devil may care period  it   s telling that streep calls florence foster jenkins    one of the most fun things i   ve ever done  without question     and makes no excuses about having chosen the project simply because it would be enjoyable     seems like a pretty damn good reason    when i ask the    year old actress if she enjoyed the london premiere  she nods eagerly and lights up     it   s really nice to hear a whole place just rollicking  isn   t it    i talked to stanley     streep says of her friend and former co star stanley tucci     he brought the teenagers  and they loved it   that   s even more important than what stanley thought  frankly    as pleased as she is that jenkins   s story resonates with young people  streep is also somewhat incredulous at her own status as social media meme     i don   t even know what that means     streep says with a laugh  she is at a loss as to how to explain taste of streep  a buzzy instagram account that features image after image of the actress emerging from or melded into various foods     people have too much time on their hands     she says     we need to create more jobs    and yet streep recognizes the power of more curious forms of entertainment   whether in wildly off key singing or her own face photoshopped onto fast food  she throws her arms up and laughs loudly at the absurdity     my head is coming out of a chimichanga  can you imagine    although florence foster jenkins is streep and frears   s first film together  they already knew each other socially  and when frears called to say he had a script for her  streep signed on without even reading it  the trust carried over to filming  as frears rarely gave his star notes  when he did  frears delivered them with great care     if you   re stupid  she   ll let you know     he says    i   m a diva   is that what you   re saying     she says with a laugh  later she adds     you would just look at me like      she raises an eyebrow      and i would say     ok  i   ll do it again  i   ll do it again  let me do it again  let me do it again        during production  which took place in the u k   frears would invoke a well known film world witticism     we   re making a movie together   let   s hope it   s the same one     as it turned out  they discovered they had a simple  shared vision  to entertain    i thought this would give pleasure     says frears    i put that high on the list     says streep much of that relied on pacing  says frears     this film depends on lightness   like a souffl      despite wrestling with some weighty themes  the creation achieves the desired lift     we actually talked about how it was somewhere between chekhov and the marx brothers     says helberg  who plays jenkins   s young piano accompanist  cosm   mcmoon  it   s through his eyes that our view of jenkins evolves from that of a deluded warbler to something deeper  more sympathetic  as her accompanist  he shares an intimate connection with jenkins  supporting her through her cringe worthy yet oddly compelling concerts    there was this beautiful relationship that you can find in the music  in the transcriptions  too     helberg says     you   d hear him pause because she forgot the lyric or give her a note that she forgot  or she   d skip a bar and he   d compensate or he   d change keys because she couldn   t hit the last note    in one particularly poignant scene  jenkins visits mcmoon   s apartment and they play a chopin prelude together  he with his left hand  she with her right  as badly as she sings  jenkins was a piano prodigy as a child  but the ravages of syphilis and mercury poisoning   used to treat the disease   withered her left arm and ended any hopes of a career as a concert pianist  after they wrapped that emotionally taxing scene  helberg recalls saying     here   s to giving up     streep corrected him     no  no  no  here   s to giving in     it was a koan about life in the guise of acting advice that her co star took to heart     i thought  oh  that   s what it is     helberg recalls     giving in to these doubts and these fears that everybody has  including the person considered the best actor ever to live    while streep  who has racked up a record    academy award acting nominations  receives such praise with grace  when she says she is merely happy to be acting she is not simply being modest     on a certain level you don   t have any choice   you   re unhappy if you   re not doing it  so you   re compelled in a certain way  and if you   re lucky you can keep working     she says     but everybody has troughs and dismal times   every single person  i remember as i was hovering around     i thought each movie would be my last  really  and all the evidence of other    year old women at that time   this is    years ago   would lead you to believe it was over     those anxieties help explain why streep is pleased to be as prolific as at any time in her nearly    year film career  but they also remind us that her later success was not preordained  streep points to a number of other impressive actresses who are her peers  but many of them followed her lead after she shattered the glass ceiling for over    actresses  since that milestone  streep has been nominated for an oscar    times   far more than any actor at that age or during that time  the most any other actor has received is     one of the more meaningful accolades streep ever received is a letter from her idol  bette davis  shortly before she died in       in it  the legendary actress praised her younger counterpart  actors who work with streep today likewise regard her with a certain degree of awe     her process does not exclude     says helberg     it   s like she sees in     degrees  and so she   s including everybody and every single thing that is happening in the moment  once she gets onto the set  it   s really about being present  and i just kind of watched her  sometimes i would just end up  you know  f   ing up because i was watching her    she   s an enigma to most people  obviously     the big bang theory star continues     she   s also so highly revered that it was impossible for me to even imagine being in a room with her  as soon as i was  she kind of called that out  it   s like she comes into the room and takes her crown off and puts it on you   which she actually did with my daughter    in london  while recording the notoriously challenging queen of the night aria from the magic flute  helberg brought his   year old to the studio     addie had seen some of these clips from mamma mia  so she   s very excited and calling for mewylstreet  mewylstreet     helberg recalls     meryl came in wearing a tiara florence had worn when she had performed  and she sat down on the floor so she could be eye to eye with my daughter  she took off her tiara  put it onto addie and said     hello  i   m meryl streep         fidelity is a theme woven through florence foster jenkins  outwardly  there   s the faithfulness and the devotion of bayfield  who also keeps a mistress at a pied    terre paid for by jenkins  and the hard won loyalty of helberg   s mcmoon  who at first is mortified by the prospect of performing in public with her   to be true to her  they had to be untrue   telling white lies and perpetuating deceptions to preserve jenkins   s self regard  the same went for the music     to get it just perfectly wrong was very challenging  you have to get to right first  and then you have to hit it with a hammer     says helberg  who is a trained jazz pianist    my biggest anxiety was that i couldn   t sing as high as she did     streep says     she hit an f above high c  do you know how high that is  it   s just insane     authenticity was paramount for streep  who tried to match jenkins note for gloriously awful note     florence sang in a particular way   i mean  the way she went wrong was particular to her  it didn   t really have rhyme or reason to it    the degree of verisimilitude streep achieved is impressive  even to a jenkins scholar like collup     it   s a carbon copy     the documentarian says     the tonal quality of her singing  the bad diction  the wavering pitch  the attempt to sing high notes and just not really making it   it   s uncanny     as streep took to the task of simulating the world   s worst singer  the rigors of rehearsal and recording took their toll     a real person  a real diva  doesn   t sing the queen of the night more than twice a week  ever     she says     and i was going to sing it three or four times a day  that was very hard  i actually lost my voice    we have gotten accustomed to seeing streep   s love of song play out on screen  there is her musical movie oeuvre   mamma mia  into the woods  ricki and the flash   and  all told  streep sings in    films  but opera is a different discipline altogether streep knows this better than most   and not just from playing jenkins  at     she began studying voice with estelle liebling  who trained beverly sills when she was still a rising star  as well as many other sopranos with the metropolitan opera  streep traveled to new york each saturday from her home in northern new jersey and labored for four years in liebling   s studio  close to carnegie hall  initially with the hope of joining a company  possibly even the met  having seen sills perform  however  streep eventually realized that  despite having a lovely voice  she wasn   t good enough to be a professional diva  and though she sang plenty  streep left her dreams of singing opera behind  until florence foster jenkins    yeah  there were moments when you   d say     sing worse         streep says to frears     you were quite close     frears responds  referring to jenkins   s idiosyncratic intonation as streep pauses in appreciation  i   m reminded of a moment late in the film  stripped of her wildly outlandish attire  jenkins delivers a line that resounds like a credo     they may say i can   t sing  but they can never say i didn   t sing     this may be true for streep  who like jenkins is striving with all her heart  though she holds herself to a higher standard  her own    at the end  i sort of thought  well  that was good     streep says  nodding     i thought i   d done well  sounded good     she pauses and adds with a laugh     i also thought i looked good  someone should have told me    all three main actors should get an oscar nomination  the movie is a riot of laughter as well as a revealing and touching movie that shows the relationship
