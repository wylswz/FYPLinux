      design by democracy might not always work  but it   s important to listen       
despite all the finery  louboutin is not precious  nor does he work with a decorator  his common areas are lived in   the large desk in his atelier is flanked by baby furniture  in the living room  a taxidermied tiger given to him by a friend sits proudly by a vintage brazilian coffee table next to needlepoint tapestries by alexander calder  if someone has any better ideas  louboutin is open to them     my trainer from paris was spending his holiday nearby and came to have lunch  he looked at the living room chandelier and said     it doesn   t make sense to have it here  you   ll hit your head         and so it was moved several feet back  requiring less than pristine housing for the wires     design by democracy might not always work     louboutin says     but it   s important to listen    a massive deck joins three of the structures  making louboutin   s bedroom easily accessible from the living room and kitchen  social life at the compound revolves around this outdoor space  where a long table seats    on rush wrapped chairs  midcentury designs attributed to t h  robsjohn gibbings     you remember the  marilyn monroe movie how to marry a millionaire  they have that table and those exact chairs in the kitchen     says louboutin  his cook reigns over the outdoor grill  preparing local fish such as whole dorade  wide steps lead down the hill from the deck  creating bleachers whose sole purpose is to make it possible to observe the changing colors of nature with the architect tarek shamma  who designed louboutin   s madrid and luxembourg boutiques  he is also adding a fifth structure  called la folly  a few hundred yards from the existing compound  on a separate plot of land nearer to the main road  in the steel rod and cement block phase now  it will become a       square foot observation deck inspired by the stepwells of jaipur  india  in the center of the structure will be a fire pit  with views visible through a series of small windows above     what   s nice about this spot is it   s very close to the water     says shamma     so all the rice fields become a lagoon in the winter  christian didn   t want another house  but he didn   t want to miss this opportunity  he runs here every morning and walks in the afternoon  so he had the idea to do something where he could stop and just be      to hear louboutin speak about his life  it has been a series of picaresque adventures  growing up in the   th arrondissement of paris the son of a cabinetmaker and a housewife  he was bright and capable but expelled from school after school  other students called him le m  tis  or    mixed race     which caused him to wonder if he was secretly adopted   three years ago he discovered he was the product of an affair his mother had with an egyptian man   louboutin was allowed to come and go when he pleased  and before he was old enough to drive  he was living part time with an older man  his closest school friend  eva ionesco  now an actress and filmmaker  was the subject of a national scandal due to provocative photographs taken by her artist mother when she was a young girl     louis malle   s poster for pretty baby was a copy of her photograph  they called her baby porno  she was so sweet that i had to protect her     he says   ionesco  now married to the novelist simon liberati  is lounging poolside  shaded by a pergola imported from rajasthan   with ionesco  louboutin became an adolescent fixture at the glamorously dissolute nightclub le palace  which resembled new york   s studio    in its high low mix of socialites  punk urchins  famous designers and rock stars  and in the enthusiastic consumption of substances of all kinds  a nomad at heart  louboutin would periodically run off to egypt or india     my favorite game as a kid was to play travel agent in my bedroom     he says     ok  so i   m traveling for three months  i want to start in the middle east and then go to india  i   m going to take this plane  arriving at six o   clock  by the time i   m out of the airport  at nine o   clock  i   ll be in the hotel     in his childhood fantasy he sent money ahead to each destination  today he is accompanied everywhere by his butler at     louboutin got his first real job working backstage as a gofer at paris   s folies berg  re  where his notebooks full of the outrageous shoes he had been sketching since he was a schoolboy failed to find any takers  looking at his dramatic designs today  with their crystal studded stilettos  exposed toe cleavage  vertiginously high heels and exotic motifs  it   s easy to trace their aesthetic roots back to that immersion in the burlesque  their spirit  too  louboutin   s shoes have always been bold and sexy  mischievous and joyful  the optimistic product of someone who went looking for himself and liked what he found  with no formal training  louboutin used those same sketches to help land a job as a design assistant at the french shoe company charles jourdan  he went on to freelance for shoe designer maud frizon and chanel  but when a temporary job for his idol roger vivier ended  louboutin believed he had experienced the best he ever would and decided to leave the business  he pursued his other passion  gardening  and started working as a landscaper then  one afternoon  when he was looking at a lamp he wanted to acquire from his friend  the dealer eric philippe  now a prominent purveyor of midcentury design  philippe pointed out an empty shop across the way in the arcade galerie v  ro dodat in the first arrondissement     he said     why don   t you do your own shoes  you just take a store         two days later  over dinner with his old friend henri seydoux and chambelland  then his romantic partner  louboutin brought up the idea  and chambelland jumped on it  helping to fund it with seydoux  the timing might have seemed fraught   it was       and the global mood was bleak   but louboutin was unfazed     most people would say it was crazy to start a business then     he says     but i don   t think there is a correct moment anyway    chambelland  who ran the business side  knew to keep the worst details away from louboutin  especially during the first few years  when    the money was bleeding     he says  luckily  american shoppers soon took interest after a fashion journalist spotted princess caroline of monaco at the store  soon  chambelland and louboutin could open wholesale accounts overseas as well as more of their own stores  expanding to new york  los angeles  london  moscow and hong kong  louboutin didn   t advertise then and still doesn   t  in the immediate aftermath of      and the subsequent cratering of the u s  luxury market  it was his geographic diversity   asia and europe were strong markets even if america wasn   t   and the rising importance of celebrities that helped him stay afloat  those red soles were always so easy to spot in paparazzi pictures  cameron diaz  oprah winfrey and rihanna brought attention to the brand just by being seen in louboutin   s wares by       the company   s growth was starting to outpace louboutin   s bandwidth  forcing him to make too many business decisions     i started to become nervous and irritable  i had changed   i couldn   t concentrate anymore     knowing they needed help  chambelland and louboutin found alexis mourot  who had worked for  marc jacobs  after an almost four hour interview  mourot came on as chief operating officer and general manager  and the business has grown    fold since  says mourot     it   s about  christian has a feeling or an idea  and how do we work to make sure it   s well managed operationally    with mourot onboard  strategic expansion became possible  though louboutin continues to work on instinct  he launched handbags in       men   s shoes  launched in       came about only because louboutin   s friend  the singer mika  wanted him to make him something he could wear on tour  today they account for    percent of sales  nail polish came next  mostly because louboutin wanted something to complement open toe models in his marketing lookbooks  but it also made sense  given that louboutin   s famous red sole was first created  in       by painting the bottom of a shoe with red nail polish  in       louboutin formed a joint venture with the private label company batallure beauty  today there are    colors of nail polish  ranging from sea foam green to dark gray to  of course  louboutin rouge  and    hues of lipsticks over the years  companies have come to him proposing licenses  including for eyewear and fashion lines  he has refused them all     legitimacy is a big thing for me     he says     and i want to work on the product  my goal is to do something i   m proud of  as long as you drive something to the end and do it your way  you   ll always be proud  if it   s successful  even better     take  for example  his packaging for his cosmetics  if the efficient packing of shipping crates makes a difference to the bottom line  then what to do with the oversize spikes on louboutin   s nail polishes  and lipstick tubes with pointed bottoms  some are covered in scales  making them look like sea creatures topped with jeweled crowns  instead of coming in classic boxes  they are nestled into cushioned jewelry style cases     we don   t make a huge margin     louboutin says     so if we need to raise the price  we raise the price     sephora stocks both lip and nail lines   with products selling for     and      respectively  as of this month     of louboutin   s own boutiques will sell the perfume  for       and nail polish lines 
      as long as you drive something to the end and do it your way  you   ll always be proud       
perfume  that great engine of profit  was the next logical step  still  mourot says this new perfume will be available in fewer than     points of sale worldwide  because    we don   t want to lose control of our distribution     to create the scent  they put out briefs to    perfumers  and louboutin ultimately winnowed down the     samples  an unusually large number to choose from  to three  the results are as maximalist as everything else louboutin has done  the hyperfeminine scents explode out of colorful glass bottles designed by thomas heatherwick    i thought the bottle should be designed by an architect     louboutin says  the late oscar niemeyer  whose drawings decorate louboutin   s melides bedroom  was his first choice to design packaging for the lipsticks and the perfume     i went to see him about the project  and he was so sweet  he was already     years old     i   m completely busy     he said     but i would love to do it if you can wait     i told him     of course i   ll wait     and then he died    heatherwick   s connection to the project was casual at first  the two chatted during a series of friendly encounters that began in london and continued during social visits with mutual friends in umbria  italy  and appointments in new york whenever their travel plans overlapped     i had never worked on designing a bottle  and didn   t expect to  and wasn   t even sure if i was interested at first  but i enjoyed bouncing ideas around with christian     heatherwick says     we were exploring everything  what color the liquid should be  if it should be a liquid at all  how you apply things to your body and the relationship of body and fragrance  finally he asked if i   d consider designing the bottle     the result resembles    a pastry where they put a slit in the middle and twist it inside out on itself     says heatherwick     the idea evolved from making a simple rectilinear bottle and turning it inside out so it still has a square top and bottom   something that played with both geometry and softness    it   s no surprise that louboutin   s scents are big     i   m a believer in the strength of people in general     he says     and beauty is a way for women to decide how they want to express themselves     unlike some designers  who have an official house muse on the payroll  louboutin has an ad hoc arrangement with a group of women who help inspire him  he counts among them ionesco and elisa sednaoui  his goddaughter  who poses in the marketing visuals for the perfume  as well as fashion fixture farida khelfa and l  a seydoux  who is a daughter of his co founder     it   s not about their looks     louboutin says  as ionesco emerges from the pool in a picture hat and a one piece black bandeau  her dark gray eye shadow smudged languorously     it   s definitely about their attitude  people who are around me  that i know  are survivors  they   re in charge of their own destiny  of themselves
