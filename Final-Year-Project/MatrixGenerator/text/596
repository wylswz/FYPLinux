going through right now was country     i what we could     just     be the voice and porsche and co     area     i work i returned her apropos     to book a week and the country to the     u s and its     allies were     more intriguing i m     in violation of     international law in iraq     in march two thousand and three     all the twilight of empire responsive to occupational cares about it     the story     with her now owned     by iraqi by american commanders at that time and we just put out with a new pulpit and cements the original one at a forward by howard and     the man with a cat     i don t think actually that     content     one of its rankings     as it is that it s not     an ideological is not a political movie     although not in the first and came into mind to go to     the     great typically go with     a liberal     utopia     walton one of them appears in her     room her stomach     and then     am i going to be up against conservative frozen obstacles but not in the story of the little that you have to look at all     on the one on the story     that     more questions than it enters     the flow of thought provoking     new free relay its doors in front     it does make me think about times when they come in     the tiny     green in     it     fremantle     eighteen     or i     might not think it just     we have this     i am a wall and all will think of them as on the media tv that i m a lot to reaction to the tone poem     you know it s not     that     i wanna know where     it     echoes the very real costs that we have     in this country is going to communicate     i don t i don t     think this polarized camps     in     the seventies really     it to the miami capital for four years for the     second thing i think now it s     one of the period of     polarization more people are kitchener can t speak     for a     total economic     banning     religion regional differences     what have you and i think the     momentum i     just on that     and speak to the importance of communicating with plenty of     indian themed but     often realizing it     the family unit     or community or an entire nation     in     a democracy     it has been a     the continual process randall and rebound in the uk happening in the family     in the end it s about learning how to communicate better how to make some adjustment     you cannot     or your way     the function of the greater community huntsman to democracy     and i think we expect our politicians     are more     careful     of course for any kind of course we have to do that herself to borrow from the movie while not ideological i m going to     make me think that i think it s very much money at that time only     you know a little movie that good     our turns to move the story     it actually called truly     that thing around     on the pulse of what s what s going on right now what unintentional can     change     and on and     also     still     lee is off to clear this is the before     on the social media greeted you go to the     i don t think given its current page of any sort     and yet its local law is though some some hollywood actors

lot of an actor in a little more often and actors again     i had enough attention to last week s roller times already don t     trade more attention     more media exposure     i have     i do the best they can to communicate with an action she physically     my family and friends     the best they can enact     a struggle with doing enough     maintaining communication     i don t have any need to get more attention or threatening hundred thousand     hundreds of thousands of people that i am i to communicate with its own seminars and inherited     not to return to people but my work as
