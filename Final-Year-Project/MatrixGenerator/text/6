Religion
Religion
(from
O.Fr.
religion
"religious
community",
from
L.
religionem
(nom.
religio)
"respect
for
what
is
sacred,
reverence
for
the
gods",[11]
"obligation,
the
bond
between
man
and
the
gods"[12])
is
derived
from
the
Latin
religio,
the
ultimate
origins
of
which
are
obscure.
One
possible
interpretation
traced
to
Cicero,
connects
lego
"read",
i.e.
re
(again)
with
lego
in
the
sense
of
"choose",
"go
over
again"
or
"consider
carefully".
Modern
scholars
such
as
Tom
Harpur
and
Joseph
Campbell
favor
the
derivation
from
ligare
"bind,
connect",
probably
from
a
prefixed
re-ligare,
i.e.
re
(again)
+
ligare
or
"to
reconnect",
which
was
made
prominent
by
St.
Augustine,
following
the
interpretation
of
Lactantius.[13][14]
The
medieval
usage
alternates
with
order
in
designating
bonded
communities
like
those
of
monastic
orders:
"we
hear
of
the
'religion'
of
the
Golden
Fleece,
of
a
knight
'of
the
religion
of
Avys'".[15]

In
the
ancient
and
medieval
world,
the
etymological
Latin
root
religio
was
understood
as
an
individual
virtue
of
worship,
never
as
doctrine,
practice,
or
actual
source
of
knowledge.[16]
The
modern
concept
of
"religion"
as
an
abstraction
which
entails
distinct
sets
of
beliefs
or
doctrines
is
a
recent
invention
in
the
English
language
since
such
usage
began
with
texts
from
the
17th
century
due
to
the
splitting
of
Christendom
during
the
Protestant
Reformation
and
more
prevalent
colonization
or
globalization
in
the
age
of
exploration
which
involved
contact
with
numerous
foreign
and
indigenous
cultures
with
non-European
languages.[16]
It
was
in
the
17th
century
that
the
concept
of
"religion"
received
its
modern
shape
despite
the
fact
that
ancient
texts
like
the
Bible,
the
Quran,
and
other
ancient
sacred
texts
did
not
have
a
concept
of
religion
in
the
original
languages
and
neither
did
the
people
or
the
cultures
in
which
these
sacred
texts
were
written.[17]
For
example,
the
Greek
word
threskeia,
which
was
used
by
Greek
writers
such
as
Herodotus
and
Josephus
and
is
found
in
texts
like
the
New
Testament,
is
sometimes
translated
as
"religion"
today,
however,
the
term
was
understood
as
"worship"
well
into
the
medieval
period.[17]
In
the
Quran,
the
Arabic
word
din
is
often
translated
as
"religion"
in
modern
translations,
but
up
to
the
mid-1600s
translators
expressed
din
as
"law".[17]
Even
in
the
1st
century
AD,
Josephus
had
used
the
Greek
term
ioudaismos,
which
some
translate
as
"Judaism"
today,
even
though
he
used
it
as
an
ethnic
term,
not
one
linked
to
modern
abstract
concepts
of
religion
as
a
set
of
beliefs.[17]
It
was
in
the
19th
century
that
the
terms
"Buddhism",
"Hinduism",
"Taoism",
and
"Confucianism"
first
emerged.[16][18]
Throughout
its
long
history,
Japan
had
no
concept
of
"religion"
since
there
was
no
corresponding
Japanese
word,
nor
anything
close
to
its
meaning,
but
when
American
warships
appeared
off
the
coast
of
Japan
in
1853
and
forced
the
Japanese
government
to
sign
treaties
demanding,
among
other
things,
freedom
of
religion,
the
country
had
to
contend
with
this
Western
idea.[18]

According
to
the
philologist
Max
Mьller
in
the
19th
century,
the
root
of
the
English
word
"religion",
the
Latin
religio,
was
originally
used
to
mean
only
"reverence
for
God
or
the
gods,
careful
pondering
of
divine
things,
piety"
(which
Cicero
further
derived
to
mean
"diligence").[19][20]
Max
Mьller
characterized
many
other
cultures
around
the
world,
including
Egypt,
Persia,
and
India,
as
having
a
similar
power
structure
at
this
point
in
history.
What
is
called
ancient
religion
today,
they
would
have
only
called
"law".[21]

Some
languages
have
words
that
can
be
translated
as
"religion",
but
they
may
use
them
in
a
very
different
way,
and
some
have
no
word
for
religion
at
all.
For
example,
the
Sanskrit
word
dharma,
sometimes
translated
as
"religion",
also
means
law.
Throughout
classical
South
Asia,
the
study
of
law
consisted
of
concepts
such
as
penance
through
piety
and
ceremonial
as
well
as
practical
traditions.
Medieval
Japan
at
first
had
a
similar
union
between
"imperial
law"
and
universal
or
"Buddha
law",
but
these
later
became
independent
sources
of
power.[22][23]

There
is
no
precise
equivalent
of
"religion"
in
Hebrew,
and
Judaism
does
not
distinguish
clearly
between
religious,
national,
racial,
or
ethnic
identities.[24]
One
of
its
central
concepts
is
"halakha",
meaning
the
"walk"
or
"path"
sometimes
translated
as
"law",
which
guides
religious
practice
and
belief
and
many
aspects
of
daily
life.[25]

Faith
The
word
religion
is
sometimes
used
interchangeably
with
faith
or
set
of
duties;[26]
however,
in
the
words
of
Йmile
Durkheim,
religion
differs
from
private
belief
in
that
it
is
"something
eminently
social".[27]

Other
terms
The
use
of
other
terms,
such
as
obedience
to
God
or
Islam
are
likewise
grounded
in
particular
histories
and
vocabularies.[28]

Definition
of
religion
Religion
as
modern
western
construct
An
increasing
number
of
scholars
have
expressed
reservations
about
ever
defining
the
"essence"
of
religion.[29]
They
observe
that
the
way
we
use
the
concept
today
is
a
particularly
modern
construct
that
would
not
have
been
understood
through
much
of
history
and
in
many
cultures
outside
the
West
(or
even
in
the
West
until
after
the
Peace
of
Westphalia).[30]
The
MacMIllan
Encyclopedia
of
Religions
states:

The
very
attempt
to
define
religion,
to
find
some
distinctive
or
possibly
unique
essence
or
set
of
qualities
that
distinguish
the
"religious"
from
the
remainder
of
human
life,
is
primarily
a
Western
concern.
The
attempt
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
Western
speculative,
intellectualistic,
and
scientific
disposition.
It
is
also
the
product
of
the
dominant
Western
religious
mode,
what
is
called
the
Judeo-Christian
climate
or,
more
accurately,
the
theistic
inheritance
from
Judaism,
Christianity,
and
Islam.
The
theistic
form
of
belief
in
this
tradition,
even
when
downgraded
culturally,
is
formative
of
the
dichotomous
Western
view
of
religion.
That
is,
the
basic
structure
of
theism
is
essentially
a
distinction
between
a
transcendent
deity
and
all
else,
between
the
creator
and
his
creation,
between
God
and
man.[31]

Classical
definitions

Urarina
shaman,
Peru,
1988
Friedrich
Schleiermacher
in
the
late
18th
century
defined
religion
as
das
schlechthinnige
Abhдngigkeitsgefьhl,
commonly
translated
as
"a
feeling
of
absolute
dependence".[32]

His
contemporary
Hegel
disagreed
thoroughly,
defining
religion
as
"the
Divine
Spirit
becoming
conscious
of
Himself
through
the
finite
spirit."[33]

Edward
Burnett
Tylor
defined
religion
in
1871
as
"the
belief
in
spiritual
beings".[34]
He
argued
that
narrowing
the
definition
to
mean
the
belief
in
a
supreme
deity
or
judgment
after
death
or
idolatry
and
so
on,
would
exclude
many
peoples
from
the
category
of
religious,
and
thus
"has
the
fault
of
identifying
religion
rather
with
particular
developments
than
with
the
deeper
motive
which
underlies
them".
He
also
argued
that
the
belief
in
spiritual
beings
exists
in
all
known
societies.

In
his
book
The
Varieties
of
Religious
Experience,
the
psychologist
William
James
defined
religion
as
"the
feelings,
acts,
and
experiences
of
individual
men
in
their
solitude,
so
far
as
they
apprehend
themselves
to
stand
in
relation
to
whatever
they
may
consider
the
divine".[2]
By
the
term
"divine"
James
meant
"any
object
that
is
godlike,
whether
it
be
a
concrete
deity
or
not"[35]
to
which
the
individual
feels
impelled
to
respond
with
solemnity
and
gravity.[36]

The
sociologist
Durkheim,
in
his
seminal
book
The
Elementary
Forms
of
the
Religious
Life,
defined
religion
as
a
"unified
system
of
beliefs
and
practices
relative
to
sacred
things".[3]
By
sacred
things
he
meant
things
"set
apart
and
forbidden—beliefs
and
practices
which
unite
into
one
single
moral
community
called
a
Church,
all
those
who
adhere
to
them".
Sacred
things
are
not,
however,
limited
to
gods
or
spirits.[note
1]
On
the
contrary,
a
sacred
thing
can
be
"a
rock,
a
tree,
a
spring,
a
pebble,
a
piece
of
wood,
a
house,
in
a
word,
anything
can
be
sacred".[37]
Religious
beliefs,
myths,
dogmas
and
legends
are
the
representations
that
express
the
nature
of
these
sacred
things,
and
the
virtues
and
powers
which
are
attributed
to
them.[38]

Echoes
of
James'
and
Durkheim's
definitions
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of,
for
example,
Frederick
Ferrй
who
defined
religion
as
"one's
way
of
valuing
most
comprehensively
and
intensively".[39]
Similarly,
for
the
theologian
Paul
Tillich,
faith
is
"the
state
of
being
ultimately
concerned",[4]
which
"is
itself
religion.
Religion
is
the
substance,
the
ground,
and
the
depth
of
man's
spiritual
life."[40]

When
religion
is
seen
in
terms
of
"sacred",
"divine",
intensive
"valuing",
or
"ultimate
concern",
then
it
is
possible
to
understand
why
scientific
findings
and
philosophical
criticisms
(e.g.
Richard
Dawkins)
do
not
necessarily
disturb
its
adherents.[41]

Modern
definitions
The
anthropologist
Clifford
Geertz
defined
religion
as
a

...system
of
symbols
which
acts
to
establish
powerful,
pervasive,
and
long-lasting
moods
and
motivations
in
men
by
formulating
conceptions
of
a
general
order
of
existence
and
clothing
these
conceptions
with
such
an
aura
of
factuality
that
the
moods
and
motivations
seem
uniquely
realistic."[1]

Alluding
perhaps
to
Tylor's
"deeper
motive",
Geertz
remarked
that

...we
have
very
little
idea
of
how,
in
empirical
terms,
this
particular
miracle
is
accomplished.
We
just
know
that
it
is
done,
annually,
weekly,
daily,
for
some
people
almost
hourly;
and
we
have
an
enormous
ethnographic
literature
to
demonstrate
it".[42]

The
theologian
Antoine
Vergote
took
the
term
"supernatural"
simply
to
mean
whatever
transcends
the
powers
of
nature
or
human
agency.
He
also
emphasized
the
"cultural
reality"
of
religion,
which
he
defined
as

...the
entirety
of
the
linguistic
expressions,
emotions
and,
actions
and
signs
that
refer
to
a
supernatural
being
or
supernatural
beings.[5]

Peter
Mandaville
and
Paul
James
intended
to
get
away
from
the
modernist
dualisms
or
dichotomous
understandings
of
immanence/transcendence,
spirituality/materialism,
and
sacredness/secularity.
They
define
religion
as

...a
relatively-bounded
system
of
beliefs,
symbols
and
practices
that
addresses
the
nature
of
existence,
and
in
which
communion
with
others
and
Otherness
is
lived
as
if
it
both
takes
in
and
spiritually
transcends
socially-grounded
ontologies
of
time,
space,
embodiment
and
knowing.[6]

According
to
the
MacMillan
Encyclopedia
of
Religions,
there
is
an
experiential
aspect
to
religion
which
can
be
found
in
almost
every
culture:

..."almost
every
known
culture
[has]
a
depth
dimension
in
cultural
experiences
[...]
toward
some
sort
of
ultimacy
and
transcendence
that
will
provide
norms
and
power
for
the
rest
of
life.
When
more
or
less
distinct
patterns
of
behavior
are
built
around
this
depth
dimension
in
a
culture,
this
structure
constitutes
religion
in
its
historically
recognizable
form.
Religion
is
the
organization
of
life
around
the
depth
dimensions
of
experience—varied
in
form,
completeness,
and
clarity
in
accordance
with
the
environing
culture.[43]

have
sacred
histories,
narratives,
and
mythologies
which
may
be
preserved
in
sacred

Religious
beliefs
Main
article:
Religious
beliefs
Traditionally,
faith,
in
addition
to
reason,
has
been
considered
a
source
of
religious
beliefs.
The
interplay
between
faith
and
reason,
and
their
use
as
actual
or
perceived
support
for
religious
beliefs,
have
been
a
subject
of
interest
to
philosophers
and
theologians.[7]

Mythology
Main
article:
Mythology
The
word
myth
has
several
meanings.

A
traditional
story
of
ostensibly
historical
events
that
serves
to
unfold
part
of
the
world
view
of
a
people
or
explain
a
practice,
belief,
or
natural
phenomenon;
A
person
or
thing
having
only
an
imaginary
or
unverifiable
existence;
or
A
metaphor
for
the
spiritual
potentiality
in
the
human
being.[45]
Ancient
polytheistic
religions,
such
as
those
of
Greece,
Rome,
and
Scandinavia,
are
usually
categorized
under
the
heading
of
mythology.
Religions
of
pre-industrial
peoples,
or
cultures
in
development,
are
similarly
called
"myths"
in
the
anthropology
of
religion.
The
term
"myth"
can
be
used
pejoratively
by
both
religious
and
non-religious
people.
By
defining
another
person's
religious
stories
and
beliefs
as
mythology,
one
implies
that
they
are
less
real
or
true
than
one's
own
religious
stories
and
beliefs.
Joseph
Campbell
remarked,
"Mythology
is
often
thought
of
as
other
people's
religions,
and
religion
can
be
defined
as
mis-interpreted
mythology."[46]

In
sociology,
however,
the
term
myth
has
a
non-pejorative
meaning.
There,
myth
is
defined
as
a
story
that
is
important
for
the
group
whether
or
not
it
is
objectively
or
provably
true.[47]
Examples
include
the
resurrection
of
their
real-life
founder
Jesus,
which,
to
Christians,
explains
the
means
by
which
they
are
freed
from
sin,
is
symbolic
of
the
power
of
life
over
death,
and
is
also
said
to
be
a
historical
event.
But
from
a
mythological
outlook,
whether
or
not
the
event
actually
occurred
is
unimportant.
Instead,
the
symbolism
of
the
death
of
an
old
"life"
and
the
start
of
a
new
"life"
is
what
is
most
significant.
Religious
believers
may
or
may
not
accept
such
symbolic
interpretations.

Social
organisation
Religions
have
a
societal
basis,
either
as
a
living
tradition
which
is
carried
by
lay
participants,
or
with
an
organized
clergy,
and
a
definition
of
what
constitutes
adherence
or
membership.

History
of
religions

A
map
of
major
denominations
and
religions
of
the
world
In
the
19th
and
20th
centuries,
the
academic
practice
of
comparative
religion
divided
religious
belief
into
philosophically
defined
categories
called
"world
religions."
Some
academics
studying
the
subject
have
divided
religions
into
three
broad
categories:

world
religions,
a
term
which
refers
to
transcultural,
international
faiths;
indigenous
religions,
which
refers
to
smaller,
culture-specific
or
nation-specific
religious
groups;
and
new
religious
movements,
which
refers
to
recently
developed
faiths.[48]
Some
recent
scholarship
has
argued
that
not
all
types
of
religion
are
necessarily
separated
by
mutually
exclusive
philosophies,
and
furthermore
that
the
utility
of
ascribing
a
practice
to
a
certain
philosophy,
or
even
calling
a
given
practice
religious,
rather
than
cultural,
political,
or
social
in
nature,
is
limited.[49][50][51]
The
current
state
of
psychological
study
about
the
nature
of
religiousness
suggests
that
it
is
better
to
refer
to
religion
as
a
largely
invariant
phenomenon
that
should
be
distinguished
from
cultural
norms
(i.e.
"religions").[52]

Some
scholars
classify
religions
as
either
universal
religions

Abrahamic
religions
are
monotheistic
religions
which
believe
they
descend
from
Abraham.

Judaism

The
Torah
is
the
primary
sacred
text
of
Judaism.
Judaism
is
the
oldest
Abrahamic
religion,
originating
in
the
people
of
ancient
Israel
and
Judea.
The
Torah
is
its
foundational
text,
and
is
part
of
the
larger
text
known
as
the
Tanakh
or
Hebrew
Bible.
It
is
supplemented
by
oral
tradition,
set
down
in
written
form
in
later
texts
such
as
the
Midrash
and
the
Talmud.
Judaism
includes
a
wide
corpus
of
texts,
practices,
theological
positions,
and
forms
of
organization.
Within
Judaism
there
are
a
variety
of
movements,
most
of
which
emerged
from
Rabbinic
Judaism,
which
holds
that
God
revealed
his
laws
and
commandments
to
Moses
on
Mount
Sinai
in
the
form
of
both
the
Written
and
Oral
Torah;
historically,
this
assertion
was
challenged
by
various
groups.
The
Jewish
people
were
scattered
after
the
destruction
of
the
Temple
in
Jerusalem
in
70
CE.
Today
there
are
about
13
million
Jews,
about
40
per
cent
living
in
Israel
and
40
per
cent
in
the
United
States.[65]
The
largest
Jewish
religious
movements
are
Orthodox
Judaism
(Haredi
Judaism
and
Modern
Orthodox
Judaism),
Conservative
Judaism
and
Reform
Judaism.

Christianity

Jesus
is
the
central
figure
of
Christianity.
Christianity
is
based
on
the
life
and
teachings
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
(1st
century)
as
presented
in
the
New
Testament.
The
Christian
faith
is
essentially
faith
in
Jesus
as
the
Christ,
the
Son
of
God,
and
as
Savior
and
Lord.
Almost
all
Christians
believe
in
the
Trinity,
which
teaches
the
unity
of
Father,
Son
(Jesus
Christ),
and
Holy
Spirit
as
three
persons
in
one
Godhead.
Most
Christians
can
describe
their
faith
with
the
Nicene
Creed.
As
the
religion
of
Byzantine
Empire
in
the
first
millennium
and
of
Western
Europe
during
the
time
of
colonization,
Christianity
has
been
propagated
throughout
the
world.
The
main
divisions
of
Christianity
are,
according
to
the
number
of
adherents:

Catholic
Church,
headed
by
the
Pope
in
Rome,
is
a
communion
of
the
Western
church
and
22
Eastern
Catholic
churches.
Eastern
Christianity,
which
include
Eastern
Orthodoxy,
Oriental
Orthodoxy,
and
the
Church
of
the
East.
Protestantism,
separated
from
the
Catholic
Church
in
the
16th-century
Reformation
and
is
split
into
many
denominations.
There
are
also
smaller
groups,
including:

Restorationism,
the
belief
that
Christianity
should
be
restored
(as
opposed
to
reformed)
along
the
lines
of
what
is
known
about
the
apostolic
early
church.
Latter
Day
Saint
movement,
founded
by
Joseph
Smith
in

Shia
Islam
is
the

Indian
religions
are
practiced
or
were
founded
in
the
Indian
subcontinent.
They
are
sometimes
classified
as
the
dharmic

as
they
all
feature
dharma,
the
specific
law
of
reality
and
duties
expected
according

Hinduism
is
a
synecdoche
describing
the
similar
philosophies
of
Vaishnavism,
Shaivism,
and
related
groups
practiced
or
founded
in
the
Indian

Concepts
most
of
them
share

include
karma,

Hinduism
is
the
most
ancient
of
still-active
religions,[67][68]
with
origins
perhaps
as
far
back
as
prehistoric
times.[69]
Hinduism
is
not
a
monolithic
religion
but
a
religious
category
containing
dozens
of
separate
philosophies
amalgamated
as
Sanatana
Dharma,
which
is
the
name
by
which
Hinduism
has
been
known
throughout
history
by
its
followers.

Jainism,
taught
primarily
by
Parsva
(9th
century
BCE)
and
Mahavira
(6th
century
BCE),
is
an
ancient
Indian
religion
that
prescribes
a
path
of
non-violence
for
all
forms
of
living
beings
in
this
world.
Jains
are
found
mostly
in
India.

Buddhism
was
founded
by
Siddhattha
Gotama
in
the
6th
century
BCE.
Buddhists
generally
agree
that
Gotama
aimed
to
help
sentient
beings
end
their
suffering
(dukkha)
by
understanding
the
true
nature
of
phenomena,
thereby
escaping
the
cycle
of
suffering
and
rebirth
(sa?sara),
that
is,
achieving
nirvana.

Theravada
Buddhism,
which
is
practiced
mainly
in
Sri
Lanka
and
Southeast
Asia
alongside
folk
religion,
shares
some
characteristics
of
Indian
religions.
It
is
based
in
a
large
collection
of
texts
called
the
Pali
Canon.
Mahayana
Buddhism
(or
the
"Great

under
which
are
a
multitude
of

China
and
are
still
relevant
in
Vietnam,
Korea,
Japan
and
to
a
lesser
extent
in
Europe
and
the
United
States.
Mahayana
Buddhism
includes
such
disparate
teachings
as
Zen,
Pure
Land,
and
Soka
Gakkai.
Vajrayana
Buddhism
first
appeared
in
India
in
the
3rd
century
CE.[70]
It
is
currently
most
prominent
in
the
Himalaya
regions[71]
and
extends
across
all
of
Asia[72]
(cf.

It
is
the
fifth-largest
organized
religion
in
the
world,
with
approximately
30
million

have
control
over
one's
internal
vices
and
be
able
to

phrase

Interfaith
cooperation
Because
religion
continues
to
be
recognized
in
Western
thought
as
a
universal
impulse,
many
religious
practitioners
have
aimed
to
band
together
in
interfaith
dialogue,
cooperation,
and
religious
peacebuilding.
The
first
major
dialogue
was
the
Parliament
of
the
World's
Religions
at
the
1893
Chicago
World's
Fair,
which
remains
notable
even
today
both
in
affirming
"universal
values"
and
recognition
of
the
diversity
of
practices
among
different
cultures.
The
20th
century
has
been
especially
fruitful
in
use
of
interfaith
dialogue
as
a
means
of
solving
ethnic,
political,

Comparative

Main

Comparative
religion
Nicholas
de
Lange,
Professor
of
Hebrew
and
Jewish
Studies
at
Cambridge
University,
says
that

The
comparative
study
of
religions
is
an
academic
discipline
which
has
been
developed
within
Christian
theology
faculties,
and
it
has
a
tendency
to
force
widely
differing
phenomena
into
a
kind
of
strait-jacket
cut
to
a
Christian
pattern.
The
problem
is
not
only
that
other
'religions'
may
have
little
or
nothing
to
say
about
questions
which
are
of
burning
importance
for
Christianity,
but
that
they
may
not
even
see
themselves
as
religions
in
precisely
the
same
way
in
which
Christianity
sees
itself
as
a
religion.[85]

Origins
and

The
Yazilikaya
sanctuary
in
Turkey,
with
the
twelve
gods
of
the
underworld
The
origin
of
religion
is
uncertain.
There
are
a
number
of
theories
regarding
the
subsequent
origins
of
religious
practices.

According
to
anthropologists
John
Monaghan
and
Peter
Just,
"Many
of
the
great
world
religions
appear
to
have
begun
as
revitalization
movements
of
some
sort,
as
the
vision
of
a
charismatic
prophet
fires
the
imaginations
of
people
seeking
a
more
comprehensive
answer
to
their
problems
than
they
feel
is
provided
by
everyday
beliefs.
Charismatic
individuals
have
emerged
at
many
times
and
places
in
the
world.
It
seems
that
the
key
to
long-term
success
–
and
many
movements
come
and
go
with
little
long-term
effect
–
has
relatively
little
to
do
with
the
prophets,
who
appear
with
surprising
regularity,
but
more
to
do
with
the
development
of
a
group
of
supporters
who
are
able
to
institutionalize
the
movement."[86]

The
development
of
religion
has
taken
different
forms
in
different
cultures.
Some
religions
place
an
emphasis
on
belief,
while
others
emphasize
practice.
Some
religions
focus
on
the
subjective
experience
of
the
religious
individual,
while
others
consider
the
activities
of
the
religious
community
to
be
most
important.
Some
religions
claim
to
be
universal,
believing
their
laws
and
cosmology
to
be
binding
for
everyone,
while
others
are
intended
to
be
practiced
only
by
a
closely
defined
or
localized
group.
In
many
places
religion
has
been
associated
with
public
institutions
such
as
education,
hospitals,
the
family,
government,
and
political
hierarchies.[87]

Anthropologists
John
Monoghan
and
Peter
Just
state
that,
"it
seems
apparent
that
one
thing
religion
or
belief
helps
us
do
is
deal
with
problems
of
human
life
that
are
significant,
persistent,
and
intolerable.
One
important
way
in
which
religious
beliefs
accomplish
this
is
by
providing
a
set
of
ideas
about
how
and
why
the
world
is
put
together
that
allows
people
to
accommodate
anxieties
and
deal
with
misfortune."[87]

Cultural
system
While
religion
is
difficult
to
define,
one
standard
model
of
religion,
used
in
religious
studies
courses,
was
proposed
by
Clifford
Geertz,
who
simply
called
it
a
"cultural
system".[88]
A
critique
of
Geertz's
model
by
Talal
Asad
categorized
religion
as
"an
anthropological
category".[89]
Richard
Niebuhr's
(1894-1962)
five-fold
classification
of
the
relationship
between
Christ
and
culture,
however,
indicates
that
religion
and
culture
can
be
seen
as
two
separate
systems,
though
not
without
some
interplay.[90]

Social
constructionism
Main
article:
Social
constructionism
One
modern
academic
theory
of
religion,
social
constructionism,
says
that
religion
is
a
modern
concept
that
suggests
all
spiritual
practice
and
worship
follows
a
model
similar
to
the
Abrahamic
religions
as
an
orientation
system
that
helps
to
interpret
reality
and
define
human
beings.[91]
Among
the
main
proponents
of
this
theory
of
religion
are
Daniel
Dubuisson,
Timothy
Fitzgerald,
Talal
Asad,
and
Jason
Ananda
Josephson.
The
social
constructionists
argue
that
religion
is
a
modern
concept
that
developed
from
Christianity
and
was
then
applied
inappropriately
to
non-Western
cultures.

Law
Main
article:
Law
and
religion
The
study
of
law
and
religion
is
a
relatively
new
field,
with
several
thousand
scholars
involved
in
law
schools,
and
academic
departments
including
political
science,
religion,
and
history
since
1980.[92]
Scholars
in
the
field
are
not
only
focused
on
strictly
legal
issues
about
religious
freedom
or
non-establishment,
but
also
study
religions
as
they
are
qualified
through
judicial
discourses
or
legal
understanding
of
religious
phenomena.
Exponents
look
at
canon
law,
natural
law,
and
state
law,
often
in
a
comparative
perspective.[93][94]
Specialists
have
explored
themes
in
western
history
regarding
Christianity
and
justice
and
mercy,
rule
and
equity,
and
discipline
and
love.[95]
Common
topics
of
interest
include
marriage
and
the
family[96]
and
human
rights.[97]
Outside
of
Christianity,
scholars
have
looked
at
law
and
religion
links
in
the
Muslim
Middle
East[98]
and
pagan
Rome.[99]

Studies
have
focused
on
secularization.[100][101]
In
particular
the
issue
of
wearing
religious
symbols
in
public,
such
as
headscarves
that
are
banned
in
French
schools,
have
received
scholarly
attention
in
the
context
of
human
rights
and
feminism.[102]

Related
aspects
Reason
and
science
Main
articles:
Faith
and
rationality,
Relationship
between
religion
and
science
and
Epistemology
Science
acknowledges
reason,
empiricism,
and
evidence;
and
religions
include
revelation,
faith
and
sacredness
whilst
also
acknowledging
philosophical
and
metaphysical
explanations
with
regard
to
the
study
of
the
universe.
Both
science
and
religion
are
not
monolithic,
timeless,
or
static
because
both
are
complex
social
and
cultural
endeavors
that
have
changed
through
time
across
languages
and
cultures.[103]

The
concepts
of
"science"
and
"religion"
are
a
recent
invention:
"religion"
emerged
in
the
17th
century
in
the
midst
of
colonization
and
globalization
and
the
Protestant
Reformation,[16][17]
"science"
emerged
in
the
19th
century
in
the
midst
of
attempts
to
narrowly
define
those
who
studied
nature,[16][104][105]
and
the
phrase
"religion
and
science"
emerged
in
the
19th
century
due
to
the
reification
of
both
concepts.[16]
It
was
in
the
19th
century
that
the
terms
"Buddhism",
"Hinduism",
"Taoism",
and
"Confucianism"
first
emerged.[16]
In
the
ancient
and
medieval
world,
the
etymological
Latin
roots
of
both
science
(scientia)
and
religion
(religio)
were
understood
as
inner
qualities
of
the
individual
or
virtues,
never
as
doctrines,
practices,
or
actual
sources
of
knowledge.[16]

In
general
the
scientific
method
gains
knowledge
by
testing
hypotheses
to
develop
theories
through
elucidation
of
facts
or
evaluation
by
experiments
and
thus
only
answers
cosmological
questions
about
the
universe
that
can
be
observed
and
measured.
It
develops
theories
of
the
world
which
best
fit
physically
observed
evidence.
All
scientific
knowledge
is
subject
to
later
refinement,
or
even
rejection,
in
the
face
of
additional
evidence.
Scientific
theories
that
have
an
overwhelming
preponderance
of
favorable
evidence
are
often
treated
as
de
facto
verities
in
general
parlance,
such
as
the
theories
of
general
relativity
and
natural
selection
to
explain
respectively
the
mechanisms
of
gravity
and
evolution.

Religion
does
not
have
a
method
per
se
partly
because
religions
emerge
through
time
from
diverse
cultures
and
it
is
an
attempt
to
find
meaning
in
the
world,
and
to
explain
humanity's
place
in
it
and
relationship
to
it
and
to
any
posited
entities.
In
terms
of
Christian
theology
and
ultimate
truths,
people
rely
on
reason,
experience,
scripture,
and
tradition
to
test
and
gauge
what
they
experience
and
what
they
should
believe.
Furthermore,
religious
models,
understanding,
and
metaphors
are
also
revisable,
as
are
scientific
models.[106]

Regarding
religion
and
science,
Albert
Einstein
states
(1940):
"For
science
can
only
ascertain
what
is,
but
not
what
should
be,
and
outside
of
its
domain
value
judgments
of
all
kinds
remain
necessary.
Religion,
on
the
other
hand,
deals
only
with
evaluations
of
human
thought
and
action;
it
cannot
justifiably
speak
of
facts
and
relationships
between
facts…Now,
even
though
the
realms
of
religion
and
science
in
themselves
are
clearly
marked
off
from
each
other,
nevertheless
there
exist
between
the
two
strong
reciprocal
relationships
and
dependencies.
Though
religion
may
be
that
which
determine
the
goals,
it
has,
nevertheless,
learned
from
science,
in
the
broadest
sense,
what
means
will
contribute
to
the
attainment
of
the
goals
it
has
set
up."

Economics

The
national
income
of
countries
correlates
negatively
with
their
how
much
they
call
themselves
"religious".[59]
Main
article:
Economics
of
religion
Further
information:
Religion
and

and
Wealth
and
religion
One
study
has
found
there
is
a
negative
correlation
between
self-defined
religiosity
and
the
wealth
of
nations.[108]
However
many
people
identify
themselves
as
part
of
a
religion
(not
irreligion)
but
do
not
self-identify
as
"religious".
For
example,
in
China
only
about
10%
self-identify
as
"religious"[108]
but
only
12%
self-identify
as
atheist.[109]

In
other
words,
the
richer
a
nation
is,
the
less
likely
its
inhabitants
to
call
themselves
"religious",[108]
whatever
this
may
mean
to
them.

Sociologist
and
political
economist
Max
Weber
has
argued
that
Protestant
Christian
countries
are
wealthier
because
of
their
Protestant
work
ethic.[110]

Politics
Religion
has
a
significant
impact
on
the
political
system
in
many
countries.
Notably,
most
Muslim-majority
countries
adopt
various
aspects
of
sharia,
the
Islamic
law.
Some
countries
even
define
themselves
in
religious
terms,
such
as
The
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran.
The
sharia
thus
affects
up
to
23%
of
the
global
population,
or
1.57
billion
people
who
are
Muslims.
However,
religion
also
affects
political
decisions
in
many
western
countries.
For
instance,
in
the
United
States,
51%
of
voters
would
be
less
likely
to
vote
for
a
presidential
candidate
who
did
not
believe
in
God,
and
only
6%
more
likely.[111]
In
most
European
countries,
however,
religion
has
a
much
smaller
influence
on
politics[112]
although
it
used
to
be
much
more
important.
For
instance,
same-sex
marriage
and
abortion
were
illegal
in
many
European
countries
until
recently,
following
Christian
(usually
Catholic)
doctrine.
Several
European
leaders
are
atheists
(e.g.
France’s
president
Francois
Hollande
or
Greece's
prime
minister
Alexis
Tsipras).
In
Asia,
the
role
of
religion
differs
widely
between
countries.
For
instance,
India
is
still
one
of
the
most
religious
countries
and
religion
still
has
a
strong
impact
on
politics,
given
that
Hindu
nationalists
have
been
targeting
minorities
like
the
Muslims
and
the
Christians,
who
historically
belonged
to
the
lower
castes.[113]
By
contrast,
countries
such
as
China
or
Japan
are
largely
secular
and
thus
religion
has
a
much
smaller
impact
on
politics.

Health
Main

Mayo

researchers
examined
the
association
between
religious
involvement
and
spirituality,
and
physical
health,
mental
health,
health-related
quality
of
life,
and
other
health
outcomes.
The
authors
reported
that:
"Most
studies
have
shown
that
religious
involvement
and
spirituality
are
associated
with
better
health
outcomes,
including
greater
longevity,
coping
skills,
and
health-related
quality
of

(even
during
terminal

and
less
anxiety,
depression,
and
suicide."[114]

The
authors
of
a
subsequent
study
concluded
that
the
influence
of
religion
on
health
is
"largely
beneficial",
based
on
a
review
of
related
literature.[115]
According
to
academic
James
W.
Jones,
several
studies
have
discovered
"positive
correlations
between
religious
belief
and
practice
and
mental
and
physical
health
and
longevity."
[116]

An
analysis
of
data
from
the
1998
US
General
Social
Survey,
whilst
broadly
confirming
that
religious
activity
was
associated
with
better
health
and
well-being,
also
suggested
that
the
role
of
different
dimensions
of
spirituality/religiosity
in
health
is
rather
more
complicated.
The
results
suggested
"that
it
may
not
be
appropriate
to
generalize
findings
about
the
relationship
between
spirituality/religiosity
and
health
from
one
form
of
spirituality/religiosity
to
another,
across
denominations,

Superstition
Further

Superstition,

Superstition
has
been
described
as
"the
incorrect
establishment
of
cause
and
effect"
or
a
false
conception
of
causation.[118]
Religion
is
more
complex
and
is
mostly
composed
of
social
institutions
and
morality.
But
some
religions
may
include
superstitions
or
make
use
of
magical
thinking.
Adherents
of
one
religion
sometimes
think
of
other
religions
as
superstition.[119][120]
Some
atheists,
deists,
and
skeptics
regard
religious
belief
as
superstition.

Greek
and
Roman
pagans,
who
saw
their
relations
with
the
gods
in
political
and
social
terms,
scorned
the
man
who
constantly
trembled
with
fear
at
the
thought
of
the
gods
(deisidaimonia),
as
a
slave
might
fear
a
cruel
and
capricious
master.
The
Romans
called
such
fear
of
the
gods
superstitio.[121]

Ancient
greek
historian
Polybius
described
superstition
in
Ancient
Rome
as
an
instrumentum
regni,
an
instrument
of
maintaining
the
cohesion
of
the
Empire.[122]

The
Roman
Catholic
Church
considers
superstition
to
be
sinful
in
the
sense
that
it
denotes
a
lack
of
trust
in
the
divine
providence
of
God
and,
as
such,
is
a
violation
of
the
first
of
the
Ten
Commandments.
The
Catechism
of
the
Catholic
Church
states
that
superstition
"in
some
sense
represents
a
perverse
excess
of
religion"
(para.
#2110).
"Superstition,"
it
says,
"is
a
deviation
of
religious
feeling
and
of
the
practices
this
feeling
imposes.
It
can
even
affect
the
worship
we
offer
the
true
God,
e.g.,
when
one
attributes
an
importance
in
some
way
magical
to
certain
practices
otherwise
lawful
or
necessary.
To
attribute
the
efficacy
of
prayers
or
of
sacramental
signs
to
their
mere
external
performance,
apart
from
the
interior
dispositions
that
they
demand
is
to
fall
into
superstition.
Cf.
Matthew
23:16-22"

Morality
and
religion
Main
article:
Morality
and
religion
Many
religions
have
value
frameworks
regarding
personal
behavior
meant
to
guide
adherents
in
determining
between
right
and
wrong.
These
include
the
Triple
Jems
of
Jainism,
Judaism's
Halacha,
Islam's
Sharia,
Catholicism's
Canon
Law,
Buddhism's
Eightfold
Path,
and
Zoroastrianism's
"good
thoughts,
good
words,
and
good
deeds"
concept,
among
others.[123]
Religion
and
morality
are
not
synonymous.
Morality
does
not
necessarily
depend
upon
religion
although
this
is
"an
almost
automatic
assumption."[124]
According
to
The
Westminster
Dictionary
of
Christian
Ethics,
religion
and
morality
"are
to
be
defined
differently
and
have
no
definitional
connections
with
each
other.
Conceptually
and
in
principle,
morality
and
a
religious
value
system
are
two
distinct
kinds
of
value
systems
or
action
guides."[125]

According
to
global
research
done
by
Gallup
on
people
from
145
countries,
adherents
of
all
the
major
world
religions
who
attended
religious
services
in
the
past
week
have
higher
rates
of
generosity
such
as
donating
money,
volunteering,
and
helping
a
stranger
than
do
their
coreligionists
who
did
not
attend
services
(non-attenders).
Even
for
people
who
were
nonreligious,
those
who
said
they
attended
religious
services
in
the
past
week
exhibited
more
generous
behaviors.[126]
Another
global
study
by
Gallup
on
people
from
140
countries
showed
that
highly
religious
people
are
more
likely
to
help
others
in
terms
of
donating
money,
volunteering,
and
helping
strangers
despite
them
having,
on
average,
lower
incomes
than
those
who
are
less
religious
or
nonreligious.[127]

A
comprehensive
study
by
Harvard
University
professor
Robert
Putnam
found
that
religious
people
are
more
charitable
than
their
irreligious
counterparts.[128][129]
The
study
revealed
that
forty
percent
of
worship
service
attending
Americans
volunteer
regularly
to
help
the
poor
and
elderly
as
opposed
to
15%
of
Americans
who
never
attend
services.[128]
Moreover,
religious
individuals
are
more
likely
than
non-religious
individuals
to
volunteer
for
school
and
youth
programs
(36%
vs.
15%),
a
neighborhood
or
civic
group
(26%
vs.
13%),
and
for
health
care
(21%
vs.
13%).[128]
Other
research
has
shown
similar
correlations
between
religiosity
and
giving.[130]

Religious
belief
appears
to
be
the
strongest
predictor
of
charitable
giving.[131][132][133][134][135]
One
study
found
that
average
charitable
giving
in
2000
by
religious
individuals
($2,210)
was
over
three
times
that
of
secular
individuals
($642).
Giving
to
non-religious
charities
by
religious
individuals
was
$88
higher.
Religious
individuals
are
also
more
likely
to
volunteer
time,
donate
blood,
and
give
back
money
when
accidentally
given
too
much
change.[133]
A
2007
study
by
the
The
Barna
Group
found
that
"active-faith"
individuals
(those
who
had
attended
a
church
service
in
the
past
week)
reported
that
they
had
given
on
average
$1,500
in
2006,
while
"no-faith"
individuals
reported
that
they
had
given
on
average
$200.
"Active-faith"
adults
claimed
to
give
twice
as
much
to
non-church-related
charities
as
"no-faith"
individuals
claimed
to
give.
They
were
also
more
likely
to
report
that
they
were
registered
to
vote,
that
they
volunteered,
that
they
personally
helped
someone
who
was
homeless,
and
to
describe
themselves
as
"active
in
the
community."[136]

Some
scientific
studies
show
that
the
degree
of
religiosity
is
generally
found
to
be
associated
with
higher
ethical
attitudes[137][138][139][140]
—
for
example,
surveys
suggesting
a
positive
connection
between
faith
and
altruism.[141]
Survey
research
suggests
that
believers
do
tend
to
hold
different
views
than
non-believers
on
a
variety
of
social,
ethical
and
moral
questions.
According
to
a
2003
survey
conducted
in
the
United
States
by
The
Barna
Group,
those
who
described
themselves
as
believers
were
less
likely
than
those
describing
themselves
as
atheists
or
agnostics
to
consider
the
following
behaviors
morally
acceptable:
cohabitating
with
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
outside
of
marriage,
enjoying
sexual
fantasies,
having
an
abortion,
sexual
relationships
outside
of
marriage,
gambling,
looking
at
pictures
of
nudity
or
explicit
sexual
behavior,
getting
drunk,
and
"having
a
sexual
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex."[142]

PROLOGUE

The
cometвЂ™s
tail
spread
across
the
dawn,
a
red
slash
that
bled
above
the
crags
of
Dragonstone
like
a
wound
in
the
pink
and
purple
sky.

The
maester
stood
on
the
windswept
balcony
outside
his
chambers.
It
was
here
the
ravens
came,
after
long
flight.
Their
droppings
speckled
the
gargoyles
that
rose
twelve
feet
tall
on
either
side
of
him,
a
hellhound
and
a
wyvern,
two
of
the
thousand
that
brooded
over
the
walls
of
the
ancient
fortress.
When
first
he
came
to
Dragonstone,
the
army
of
stone
grotesques
had
made
him
uneasy,
but
as
the
years
passed
he
had
grown
used
to
them.
Now
he
thought
of
them
as
old
friends.
The
three
of
them
watched
the
sky
together
with
foreboding.

The
maester
did
not
believe
in
omens.
And
yetвЂ¦
old
as
he
was,
Cressen
had
never
seen
a
comet
half
so
bright,
nor
yet
that
color,
that
terrible
color,
the
color
of
blood
and
flame
and
sunsets.
He
wondered
if
his
gargoyles
had
ever
seen
its
like.
They
had
been
here
so
much
longer
than
he
had,
and
would
still
be
here
long
after
he
was
gone.
If
stone
tongues
could
speakвЂ¦

Such
folly.
He
leaned
against
the
battlement,
the
sea
crashing
beneath
him,
the
black
stone
rough
beneath
his
fingers.
Talking
gargoyles
and
prophecies
in
the
sky.
I
am
an
old
done
man,
grown
giddy
as
a
child
again.
Had
a
lifetimeвЂ™s
hard-won
wisdom
fled
him
along
with
his
health
and
strength?
He
was
a
maester,
trained
and
chained
in
the
great
Citadel
of
Oldtown.
What
had
he
come
to,
when
superstition
filled
his
head
as
if
he
were
an
ignorant
fieldhand?

And
yetвЂ¦
and
yetвЂ¦
the
comet
burned
even
by
day
now,
while
pale
grey
steam
rose
from
the
hot
vents
of
Dragonmont
behind
the
castle,
and
yestermorn
a
white
raven
had
brought
word
from
the
Citadel
itself,
word
long-expected
but
no
less
fearful
for
all
that,
word
of
summerвЂ™s
end.
Omens,
all.
Too
many
to
deny.
What
does
it
all
mean?
he
wanted
to
cry.

вЂњMaester
Cressen,
we
have
visitors.вЂќ
Pylos
spoke
softly,
as
if
loath
to
disturb
CressenвЂ™s
solemn
meditations.
Had
he
known
what
drivel
filled
his
head,
he
would
have
shouted.
вЂњThe
princess
would
see
the
white
raven.вЂќ
Ever
correct,
Pylos
called
her
princess
now,
as
her
lord
father
was
a
king.
King
of
a
smoking
rock
in
the
great
salt
sea,
yet
a
king
nonetheless.
вЂњHer
fool
is
with
her.вЂќ

The
old
man
turned
away
from
the
dawn,
keeping
a
hand
on
his
wyvern
to
steady
himself.
вЂњHelp
me
to
my
chair
and
show
them
in.вЂќ

Taking
his
arm,
Pylos
led
him
inside.
In
his
youth,
Cressen
had
walked
briskly,
but
he
was
not
far
from
his
eightieth
name
day
now,
and
his
legs
were
frail
and
unsteady.
Two
years
past,
he
had
fallen
and
shattered
a
hip,
and
it
had
never
mended
properly.
Last
year
when
he
took
ill,
the
Citadel
had
sent
Pylos
out
from
Oldtown,
mere
days
before
Lord
Stannis
had
closed
the
isleвЂ¦
to
help
him
in
his
labors,
it
was
said,
but
Cressen
knew
the
truth.
Pylos
had
come
to
replace
him
when
he
died.
He
did
not
mind.
Someone
must
take
his
place,
and
sooner
than
he
would
likeвЂ¦

He
let
the
younger
man
settle
him
behind
his
books
and
papers.
вЂњGo
bring
her.
It
is
ill
to
keep
a
lady
waiting.вЂќ
He
waved
a
hand,
a
feeble
gesture
of
haste
from
a
man
no
longer
capable
of
hastening.
His
flesh
was
wrinkled
and
spotted,
the
skin
so
papery
thin
that
he
could
see
the
web
of
veins
and
the
shape
of
bones
beneath.
And
how
they
trembled,
these
hands
of
his
that
had
once
been
so
sure
and
deftвЂ¦

When
Pylos
returned
the
girl
came
with
him,
shy
as
ever.
Behind
her,
shuffling
and
hopping
in
that
queer
sideways
walk
of
his,
came
her
fool.
On
his
head
was
a
mock
helm
fashioned
from
an
old
tin
bucket,
with
a
rack
of
deer
antlers
strapped
to
the
crown
and
hung
with
cowbells.
With
his
every
lurching
step,
the
bells
rang,
each
with
a
different
voice,
clang-a-dang
bong-dong
ring-a-ling
clong
clong
clong.

вЂњWho
comes
to
see
us
so
early,
Pylos?вЂќ
Cressen
said.

вЂњItвЂ™s
me
and
Patches,
Maester.вЂќ
Guileless
blue
eyes
blinked
at
him.
Hers
was
not
a
pretty
face,
alas.
The
child
had
her
lord
fatherвЂ™s
square
jut
of
jaw
and
her
motherвЂ™s
unfortunate
ears,
along
with
a
disfigurement
all
her
own,
the
legacy
of
the
bout
of
greyscale
that
had
almost
claimed
her
in
the
crib.
Across
half
one
cheek
and
well
down
her
neck,
her
flesh
was
stiff
and
dead,
the
skin
cracked
and
flaking,
mottled
black
and
grey
and
stony
to
the
touch.
вЂњPylos
said
we
might
see
the
white
raven.вЂќ

вЂњIndeed
you
may,вЂќ
Cressen
answered.
As
if
he
would
ever
deny
her.
She
had
been
denied
too
often
in
her
time.
Her
name
was
Shireen.
She
would
be
ten
on
her
next
name
day,
and
she
was
the
saddest
child
that
Maester
Cressen
had
ever
known.
Her
sadness
is
my
shame,
the
old
man
thought,
another
mark
of
my
failure.
вЂњMaester
Pylos,
do
me
a
kindness
and
bring
the
bird
down
from
the
rookery
for
the
Lady
Shireen.вЂќ

вЂњIt
would
be
my
pleasure.вЂќ
Pylos
was
a
polite
youth,
no
more
than
five-and-twenty,
yet
solemn
as
a
man
of
sixty.
If
only
he
had
more
humor,
more
life
in
him;
that
was
what
was
needed
here.
Grim
places
needed
lightening,
not
solemnity,
and
Dragonstone
was
grim
beyond
a
doubt,
a
lonely
citadel
in
the
wet
waste
surrounded
by
storm
and
salt,
with
the
smoking
shadow
of
the
mountain
at
its
back.
A
maester
must
go
where
he
is
sent,
so
Cressen
had
come
here
with
his
lord
some
twelve
years
past,
and
he
had
served,
and
served
well.
Yet
he
had
never
loved
Dragonstone,
nor
ever
felt
truly
at
home
here.
Of
late,
when
he
woke
from
restless
dreams
in
which
the
red
woman
figured
disturbingly,
he
often
did
not
know
where
he
was.

The
fool
turned
his
patched
and
piebald
head
to
watch
Pylos
climb
the
steep
iron
steps
to
the
rookery.
His
bells
rang
with
the
motion.
вЂњUnder
the
sea,
the
birds
have
scales
for
feathers,вЂќ
he
said,
clang-a-langing.
вЂњI
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

Even
for
a
fool,
Patchface
was
a
sorry
thing.
Perhaps
once
he
could
evoke
gales
of
laughter
with
a
quip,
but
the
sea
had
taken
that
power
from
him,
along
with
half
his
wits
and
all
his
memory.
He
was
soft
and
obese,
subject
to
twitches
and
trembles,
incoherent
as
often
as
not.
The
girl
was
the
only
one
who
laughed
at
him
now,
the
only
one
who
cared
if
he
lived
or
died.

An
ugly
little
girl
and
a
sad
fool,
and
maester
makes
threeвЂ¦
now
there
is
a
tale
to
make
men
weep.
вЂњSit
with
me,
child.вЂќ
Cressen
beckoned
her
closer.
вЂњThis
is
early
to
come
calling,
scarce
past
dawn.
You
should
be
snug
in
your
bed.вЂќ

вЂњI
had
bad
dreams,вЂќ
Shireen
told
him.
вЂњAbout
the
dragons.
They
were
coming
to
eat
me.вЂќ

The
child
had
been
plagued
by
nightmares
as
far
back
as
Maester
Cressen
could
recall.
вЂњWe
have
talked
of
this
before,вЂќ
he
said
gently.
вЂњThe
dragons
cannot
come
to
life.
They
are
carved
of
stone,
child.
In
olden
days,
our
island
was
the
westernmost
outpost
of
the
great
Freehold
of
Valyria.
It
was
the
Valyrians
who
raised
this
citadel,
and
they
had
ways
of
shaping
stone
since
lost
to
us.
A
castle
must
have
towers
wherever
two
walls
meet
at
an
angle,
for
defense.
The
Valyrians
fashioned
these
towers
in
the
shape
of
dragons
to
make
their
fortress
seem
more
fearsome,
just
as
they
crowned
their
walls
with
a
thousand
gargoyles
instead
of
simple
crenellations.вЂќ
He
took
her
small
pink
hand
in
his
own
frail
spotted
one
and
gave
it
a
gentle
squeeze.
вЂњSo
you
see,
there
is
nothing
to
fear.
вЂњ

Shireen
was
unconvinced.
вЂњWhat
about
the
thing
in
the
sky?
Dalla
and
Matrice
were
talking
by
the
well,
and
Dalla
said
she
heard
the
red
woman
tell
Mother
that
it
was
dragonsbreath.
If
the
dragons
are
breathing,
doesnвЂ™t
that
mean
they
are
coming
to
life?вЂќ

The
red
woman,
Maester
Cressen
thought
sourly.
Ill
enough
that
sheвЂ™s
filled
the
head
of
the
mother
with
her
madness,
must
she
poison
the
daughterвЂ™s
dreams
as
well?
He
would
have
a
stern
word
with
Dalla,
warn
her
not
to
spread
such
tales.
вЂњThe
thing
in
the
sky
is
a
comet,
sweet
child.
A
star
with
a
tail,
lost
in
the
heavens.
It
will
be
gone
soon
enough,
never
to
be
seen
again
in
our
lifetimes.
Watch
and
see.вЂќ

Shireen
gave
a
brave
little
nod.
вЂњMother
said
the
white
raven
means
itвЂ™s
not
summer
anymore.вЂќ

вЂњThat
is
so,
my
lady.
The
white
ravens
fly
only
from
the
Citadel.вЂќ
CressenвЂ™s
fingers
went
to
the
chain
about
his
neck,
each
link
forged
from
a
different
metal,
each
symbolizing
his
mastery
of
another
branch
of
learning;
the
maesterвЂ™s
collar,
mark
of
his
order.
In
the
pride
of
his
youth,
he
had
worn
it
easily,
but
now
it
seemed
heavy
to
him,
the
metal
cold
against
his
skin.
вЂњThey
are
larger
than
other
ravens,
and
more
clever,
bred
to
carry
only
the
most
important
messages.
This
one
came
to
tell
us
that
the
Conclave
has
met,
considered
the
reports
and
measurements
made
by
maesters
all
over
the
realm,
and
declared
this
great
summer
done
at
last.
Ten
years,
two
turns,
and
sixteen
days
it
lasted,
the
longest
summer
in
living
memory.вЂќ

вЂњWill
it
get
cold
now?вЂќ
Shireen
was
a
summer
child,
and
had
never
known
true
cold.

вЂњIn
time,вЂќ
Cressen
replied.
вЂњIf
the
gods
are
good,
they
will
grant
us
a
warm
autumn
and
bountiful
harvests,
so
we
might
prepare
for
the
winter
to
come.вЂќ
The
smallfolk
said
that
a
long
summer
meant
an
even
longer
winter,
but
the
maester
saw
no
reason
to
frighten
the
child
with
such
tales.

Patchface
rang
his
bells.
вЂњIt
is
always
summer
under
the
sea,вЂќ
he
intoned.
вЂњThe
merwives
wear
nennymoans
in
their
hair
and
weave
gowns
of
silver
seaweed.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

Shireen
giggled.
вЂњI
should
like
a
gown
of
silver
seaweed.вЂќ

вЂњUnder
the
sea,
it
snows
up,вЂќ
said
the
fool,
вЂњand
the
rain
is
dry
as
bone.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

вЂњWill
it
truly
snow?вЂќ
the
child
asked.

вЂњIt
will,вЂќ
Cressen
said.
But
not
for
years
yet,
I
pray,
and
then
not
for
long.
вЂњAh,
here
is
Pylos
with
the
bird.вЂќ

Shireen
gave
a
cry
of
delight.
Even
Cressen
had
to
admit
the
bird
made
an
impressive
sight,
white
as
snow
and
larger
than
any
hawk,
with
the
bright
black
eyes
that
meant
it
was
no
mere
albino,
but
a
truebred
white
raven
of
the
Citadel.
вЂњHere,вЂќ
he
called.
The
raven
spread
its
wings,
leapt
into
the
air,
and
flapped
noisily
across
the
room
to
land
on
the
table
beside
him.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
see
to
your
breakfast
now,вЂќ
Pylos
announced.
Cressen
nodded.
вЂњThis
is
the
Lady
Shireen,вЂќ
he
told
the
raven.
The
bird
bobbed
its
pale
head
up
and
down,
as
if
it
were
bowing.
вЂњLady,вЂќ
it
croaked.
вЂњLady.вЂќ

The
childвЂ™s
mouth
gaped
open.
вЂњIt
talks!вЂќ

вЂњA
few
words.
As
I
said,
they
are
clever,
these
birds.вЂќ

вЂњClever
bird,
clever
man,
clever
clever
fool,вЂќ
said
Patchface,
jangling.
вЂњOh,
clever
clever
clever
fool.вЂќ
He
began
to
sing.
вЂњThe
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,вЂќ
he
sang,
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
back
again.
вЂњThe
shadows
come
to
stay,
my
lord,
stay
my
lord,
stay
my
lord.вЂќ
He
jerked
his
head
with
each
word,
the
bells
in
his
antlers
sending
up
a
clangor.

The
white
raven
screamed
and
went
flapping
away
to
perch
on
the
iron
railing
of
the
rookery
stairs.
Shireen
seemed
to
grow
smaller.
вЂњHe
sings
that
all
the
time.
I
told
him
to
stop
but
he
wonвЂ™t.
It
makes
me
scared.
Make
him
stop.вЂќ

And
how
do
I
do
that?
the
old
man
wondered.
Once
I
might
have
silenced
him
forever,
but
nowвЂ¦

Patchface
had
come
to
them
as
a
boy.
Lord
Steffon
of
cherished
memory
had
found
him
in
Volantis,
across
the
narrow
sea.
The
kingвЂ”the
old
king,
Aerys
II
Targaryen,
who
had
not
been
quite
so
mad
in
those
daysвЂ”had
sent
his
lordship
to
seek
a
bride
for
Prince
Rhaegar,
who
had
no
sisters
to
wed.
вЂњWe
have
found
the
most
splendid
fool,вЂќ
he
wrote
Cressen,
a
fortnight
before
he
was
to
return
home
from
his
fruitless
mission.
вЂњOnly
a
boy,
yet
nimble
as
a
monkey
and
witty
as
a
dozen
courtiers.
He
juggles
and
riddles
and
does
magic,
and
he
can
sing
prettily
in
four
tongues.
We
have
bought
his
freedom
and
hope
to
bring
him
home
with
us.
Robert
will
be
delighted
with
him,
and
perhaps
in
time
he
will
even
teach
Stannis
how
to
laugh.вЂќ

It
saddened
Cressen
to
remember
that
letter.
No
one
had
ever
taught
Stannis
how
to
laugh,
least
of
all
the
boy
Patchface.
The
storm
came
up
suddenly,
howling,
and
Shipbreaker
Bay
proved
the
truth
of
its
name.
The
lordвЂ™s
two-masted
galley
Windproud
broke
up
within
sight
of
his
castle.
From
its
parapets
his
two
eldest
sons
had
watched
as
their
fatherвЂ™s
ship
was
smashed
against
the
rocks
and
swallowed
by
the
waters.
A
hundred
oarsmen
and
sailors
went
down
with
Lord
Steffon
Baratheon
and
his
lady
wife,
and
for
days
thereafter
every
tide
left
a
fresh
crop
of
swollen
corpses
on
the
strand
below
StormвЂ™s
End.

The
boy
washed
up
on
the
third
day.
Maester
Cressen
had
come
down
with
the
rest,
to
help
put
names
to
the
dead.
When
they
found
the
fool
he
was
naked,
his
skin
white
and
wrinkled
and
powdered
with
wet
sand.
Cressen
had
thought
him
another
corpse,
but
when
Jommy
grabbed
his
ankles
to
drag
him
off
to
the
burial
wagon,
the
boy
coughed
water
and
sat
up.
To
his
dying
day,
Jommy
had
sworn
that
PatchfaceвЂ™s
flesh
was
clammy
cold.

No
one
ever
explained
those
two
days
the
fool
had
been
lost
in
the
sea.
The
fisherfolk
liked
to
say
a
mermaid
had
taught
him
to
breathe
water
in
return
for
his
seed.
Patchface
himself
had
said
nothing.
The
witty,
clever
lad
that
Lord
Steffon
had
written
of
never
reached
StormвЂ™s
End;
the
boy
they
found
was
someone
else,
broken
in
body
and
mind,
hardly
capable
of
speech,
much
less
of
wit.
Yet
his
foolвЂ™s
face
left
no
doubt
of
who
he
was.
It
was
the
fashion
in
the
Free
City
of
Volantis
to
tattoo
the
faces
of
slaves
and
servants;
from
neck
to
scalp
the
boyвЂ™s
skin
had
been
patterned
in
squares
of
red
and
green
motley.

вЂњThe
wretch
is
mad,
and
in
pain,
and
no
use
to
anyone,
least
of
all
himself,вЂќ
declared
old
Ser
Harbert,
the
castellan
of
StormвЂ™s
End
in
those
years.
вЂњThe
kindest
thing
you
could
do
for
that
one
is
fill
his
cup
with
the
milk
of
the
poppy.
A
painless
sleep,
and
thereвЂ™s
an
end
to
it.
HeвЂ™d
bless
you
if
he
had
the
wit
for
it.вЂќ
But
Cressen
had
refused,
and
in
the
end
he
had
won.
Whether
Patchface
had
gotten
any
joy
of
that
victory
he
could
not
say,
not
even
today,
so
many
years
later.

вЂњThe
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,вЂќ
the
fool
sang
on,
swinging
his
head
and
making
his
bells
clang
and
clatter.
Bong
dong,
ring-a-ling,
bong
dong.

вЂњLord,вЂќ
the
white
raven
shrieked.
вЂњLord,
lord,
lord.вЂќ

вЂњA
fool
sings
what
he
will,вЂќ
the
maester
told
his
anxious
princess.
вЂњYou
must
not
take
his
words
to
heart.
On
the
morrow
he
may
remember
another
song,
and
this
one
will
never
be
heard
again.вЂќ
He
can
sing
prettily
in
four
tongues,
Lord
Steffon
had
writtenвЂ¦

Pylos
strode
through
the
door.
вЂњMaester,
pardons.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
forgotten
the
porridge,вЂќ
Cressen
said,
amused.
That
was
most
unlike
Pylos.

вЂњMaester,
Ser
Davos
returned
last
night.
They
were
talking
of
it
in
the
kitchen.
I
thought
you
would
want
to
know
at
once.вЂќ

вЂњDavosвЂ¦
last
night,
you
say?
Where
is
he?вЂќ

вЂњWith
the
king.
They
have
been
together
most
of
the
night.вЂќ

There
was
a
time
when
Lord
Stannis
would
have
woken
him,
no
matter
the
hour,
to
have
him
there
to
give
his
counsel.
вЂњI
should
have
been
told,вЂќ
Cressen
complained.
вЂњI
should
have
been
woken.вЂќ
He
disentangled
his
fingers
from
ShireenвЂ™s.
вЂњPardons,
my
lady,
but
I
must
speak
with
your
lord
father.
Pylos,
give
me
your
arm.
There
are
too
many
steps
in
this
castle,
and
it
seems
to
me
they
add
a
few
every
night,
just
to
vex
me.вЂќ

Shireen
and
Patchface
followed
them
out,
but
the
child
soon
grew
restless
with
the
old
manвЂ™s
creeping
pace
and
dashed
ahead,
the
fool
lurching
after
her
with
his
cowbells
clanging
madly.

Castles
are
not
friendly
places
for
the
frail,
Cressen
was
reminded
as
he
descended
the
turnpike
stairs
of
Sea
Dragon
Tower.
Lord
Stannis
would
be
found
in
the
Chamber
of
the
Painted
Table,
atop
the
Stone
Drum,
DragonstoneвЂ™s
central
keep,
so
named
for
the
way
its
ancient
walls
boomed
and
rumbled
during
storms.
To
reach
him
they
must
cross
the
gallery,
pass
through
the
middle
and
inner
walls
with
their
guardian
gargoyles
and
black
iron
gates,
and
ascend
more
steps
than
Cressen
cared
to
contemplate.
Young
men
climbed
steps
two
at
a
time;
for
old
men
with
bad
hips,
every
one
was
a
torment.
But
Lord
Stannis
would
not
think
to
come
to
him,
so
the
maester
resigned
himself
to
the
ordeal.
He
had
Pylos
to
help
him,
at
the
least,
and
for
that
he
was
grateful.

Shuffling
along
the
gallery,
they
passed
before
a
row
of
tall
arched
windows
with
commanding
views
of
the
outer
bailey,
the
curtain
wall,
and
the
fishing
village
beyond.
In
the
yard,
archers
were
firing
at
practice
butts
to
the
call
of
вЂњNotch,
draw,
loose.вЂќ
Their
arrows
made
a
sound
like
a
flock
of
birds
taking
wing.
Guardsmen
strode
the
wallwalks,
peering
between
the
gargoyles
on
the
host
camped
without.
The
morning
air
was
hazy
with
the
smoke
of
cookfires,
as
three
thousand
men
sat
down
to
break
their
fasts
beneath
the
banners
of
their
lords.
Past
the
sprawl
of
the
camp,
the
anchorage
was
crowded
with
ships.
No
craft
that
had
come
within
sight
of
Dragonstone
this
past
half
year
had
been
allowed
to
leave
again.
Lord
StannisвЂ™s
Fury,
a
triple-decked
war
galley
of
three
hundred
oars,
looked
almost
small
beside
some
of
the
big-bellied
carracks
and
cogs
that
surrounded
her.

The
guardsmen
outside
the
Stone
Drum
knew
the
maesters
by
sight,
and
passed
them
through.
вЂњWait
here,вЂќ
Cressen
told
Pylos,
within.
вЂњItвЂ™s
best
I
see
him
alone.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
a
long
climb,
Maester.вЂќ

Cressen
smiled.
вЂњYou
think
I
have
forgotten?
I
have
climbed
these
steps
so
often
I
know
each
one
by
name.вЂќ

Halfway
up,
he
regretted
his
decision.
He
had
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
and
ease
the
pain
in
his
hip
when
he
heard
the
scuff
of
boots
on
stone,
and
came
face-to-face
with
Ser
Davos
Seaworth,
descending.

Davos
was
a
slight
man,
his
low
birth
written
plain
upon
a
common
face.
A
well-worn
green
cloak,
stained
by
salt
and
spray
and
faded
from
the
sun,
draped
his
thin
shoulders,
over
brown
doublet
and
breeches
that
matched
brown
eyes
and
hair.
About
his
neck
a
pouch
of
worn
leather
hung
from
a
thong.
His
small
beard
was
well
peppered
with
grey,
and
he
wore
a
leather
glove
on
his
maimed
left
hand.
When
he
saw
Cressen,
he
checked
his
descent.

вЂњSer
Davos,вЂќ
the
maester
said.
вЂњWhen
did
you
return?вЂќ

вЂњIn
the
black
of
morning.
My
favorite
time.вЂќ
It
was
said
that
no
one
had
ever
handled
a
ship
by
night
half
so
well
as
Davos
Shorthand.
Before
Lord
Stannis
had
knighted
him,
he
had
been
the
most
notorious
and
elusive
smuggler
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

вЂњAnd?вЂќ

The
man
shook
his
head.
вЂњIt
is
as
you
warned
him.
They
will
not
rise,
Maester.
Not
for
him.
They
do
not
love
him.вЂќ

No,
Cressen
thought.
Nor
will
they
ever.
He
is
strong,
able,
justвЂ¦
aye,
just
past
the
point
of
wisdomвЂ¦
yet
it
is
not
enough.
It
has
never
been
enough.
вЂњYou
spoke
to
them
all?вЂќ

вЂњAll?
No.
Only
those
that
would
see
me.
They
do
not
love
me
either,
these
highborns.
To
them
IвЂ™ll
always
be
the
Onion
Knight.вЂќ
His
left
hand
closed,
stubby
fingers
locking
into
a
fist;
Stannis
had
hacked
the
ends
off
at
the
last
joint,
all
but
the
thumb.
вЂњI
broke
bread
with
Gulian
Swann
and
old
Penrose,
and
the
Tarths
consented
to
a
midnight
meeting
in
a
grove.
The
othersвЂ”well,
Beric
Dondarrion
is
gone
missing,
some
say
dead,
and
Lord
Caron
is
with
Renly.
Bryce
the
Orange,
of
the
Rainbow
Guard.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Rainbow
Guard?вЂќ

вЂњRenlyвЂ™s
made
his
own
Kingsguard,вЂќ
the
onetime
smuggler
explained,
вЂњbut
these
seven
donвЂ™t
wear
white.
Each
one
has
his
own
color.
Loras
TyrellвЂ™s
their
Lord
Commander.вЂќ

It
was
just
the
sort
of
notion
that
would
appeal
to
Renly
Baratheon;
a
splendid
new
order
of
knighthood,
with
gorgeous
new
raiment
to
proclaim
it.
Even
as
a
boy,
Renly
had
loved
bright
colors
and
rich
fabrics,
and
he
had
loved
his
games
as
well.
вЂњLook
at
me!вЂќ
he
would
shout
as
he
ran
laughing
through
the
halls
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
вЂњLook
at
me,
IвЂ™m
a
dragon,вЂќ
or
вЂњLook
at
me,
IвЂ™m
a
wizard,вЂќ
or
вЂњLook
at
me,
look
at
me,
IвЂ™m
the
rain
god.вЂќ

The
bold
little
boy
with
wild
black
hair
and
laughing
eyes
was
a
man
grown
now,
one-and-twenty,
and
still
he
played
his
games.
Look
at
me,
IвЂ™m
a
king,
Cressen
thought
sadly.
Oh,
Renly,
Renly,
dear
sweet
child,
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing?
And
would
you
care
if
you
did?
Is
there
anyone
who
cares
for
him
but
me?
вЂњWhat
reasons
did
the
lords
give
for
their
refusals?вЂќ
he
asked
Ser
Davos.

вЂњWell,
as
to
that,
some
gave
me
soft
words
and
some
blunt,
some
made
excuses,
some
promises,
some
only
lied.вЂќ
He
shrugged.
вЂњIn
the
end
words
are
just
wind.вЂќ

вЂњYou
could
bring
him
no
hope?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
the
false
sort,
and
IвЂ™d
not
do
that,вЂќ
Davos
said.
вЂњHe
had
the
truth
from
me.вЂќ

Maester
Cressen
remembered
the
day
Davos
had
been
knighted,
after
the
siege
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
Lord
Stannis
and
a
small
garrison
had
held
the
castle
for
close
to
a
year,
against
the
great
host
of
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne.
Even
the
sea
was
closed
against
them,
watched
day
and
night
by
Redwyne
galleys
flying
the
burgundy
banners
of
the
Arbor.
Within
StormвЂ™s
End,
the
horses
had
long
since
been
eaten,
the
dogs
and
cats
were
gone,
and
the
garrison
was
down
to
roots
and
rats.
Then
came
a
night
when
the
moon
was
new
and
black
clouds
hid
the
stars.
Cloaked
in
that
darkness,
Davos
the
smuggler
had
dared
the
Redwyne
cordon
and
the
rocks
of
Shipbreaker
Bay
alike.
His
little
ship
had
a
black
hull,
black
sails,
black
oars,
and
a
hold
crammed
with
onions
and
salt
fish.
Little
enough,
yet
it
had
kept
the
garrison
alive
long
enough
for
Eddard
Stark
to
reach
StormвЂ™s
End
and
break
the
siege.

Lord
Stannis
had
rewarded
Davos
with
choice
lands
on
Cape
Wrath,
a
small
keep,
and
a
knightвЂ™s
honorsвЂ¦
but
he
had
also
decreed
that
he
lose
a
joint
of
each
finger
on
his
left
hand,
to
pay
for
all
his
years
of
smuggling.
Davos
had
submitted,
on
the
condition
that
Stannis
wield
the
knife
himself;
he
would
accept
no
punishment
from
lesser
hands.
The
lord
had
used
a
butcherвЂ™s
cleaver,
the
better
to
cut
clean
and
true.
Afterward,
Davos
had
chosen
the
name
Seaworth
for
his
new-made
house,
and
he
took
for
his
banner
a
black
ship
on
a
pale
grey
fieldвЂ”with
an
onion
on
its
sails.
The
onetime
smuggler
was
fond
of
saying
that
Lord
Stannis
had
done
him
a
boon,
by
giving
him
four
less
fingernails
to
clean
and
trim.

No,
Cressen
thought,
a
man
like
that
would
give
no
false
hope,
nor
soften
a
hard
truth.
вЂњSer
Davos,
truth
can
be
a
bitter
draught,
even
for
a
man
like
Lord
Stannis.
He
thinks
only
of
returning
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
in
the
fullness
of
his
power,
to
tear
down
his
enemies
and
claim
what
is
rightfully
his.
Yet
nowвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњIf
he
takes
this
meager
host
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
it
will
be
only
to
die.
He
does
not
have
the
numbers.
I
told
him
as
much,
but
you
know
his
pride.вЂќ
Davos
held
up
his
gloved
hand.
вЂњMy
fingers
will
grow
back
before
that
man
bends
to
sense.вЂќ

The
old
man
sighed.
вЂњYou
have
done
all
you
could.
Now
I
must
add
my
voice
to
yours.вЂќ
Wearily,
he
resumed
his
climb.

Lord
Stannis
BaratheonвЂ™s
refuge
was
a
great
round
room
with
walls
of
bare
black
stone
and
four
tall
narrow
windows
that
looked
out
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass.
In
the
center
of
the
chamber
was
the
great
table
from
which
it
took
its
name,
a
massive
slab
of
carved
wood
fashioned
at
the
command
of
Aegon
Targaryen
in
the
days
before
the
Conquest.
The
Painted
Table
was
more
than
fifty
feet
long,
perhaps
half
that
wide
at
its
widest
point,
but
less
than
four
feet
across
at
its
narrowest.
AegonвЂ™s
carpenters
had
shaped
it
after
the
land
of
Westeros,
sawing
out
each
bay
and
peninsula
until
the
table
nowhere
ran
straight.
On
its
surface,
darkened
by
near
three
hundred
years
of
varnish,
were
painted
the
Seven
Kingdoms
as
they
had
been
in
AegonвЂ™s
day;
rivers
and
mountains,
castles
and
cities,
lakes
and
forests.

There
was
a
single
chair
in
the
room,
carefully
positioned
in
the
precise
place
that
Dragonstone
occupied
off
the
coast
of
Westeros,
and
raised
up
to
give
a
good
view
of
the
tabletop.
Seated
in
the
chair
was
a
man
in
a
tight-laced
leather
jerkin
and
breeches
of
roughspun
brown
wool.
When
Maester
Cressen
entered,
he
glanced
up.
вЂњI
knew
you
would
come,
old
man,
whether
I
summoned
you
or
no.вЂќ
There
was
no
hint
of
warmth
in
his
voice;
there
seldom
was.

Stannis
Baratheon,
Lord
of
Dragonstone
and
by
the
grace
of
the
gods
rightful
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros,
was
broad
of
shoulder
and
sinewy
of
limb,
with
a
tightness
to
his
face
and
flesh
that
spoke
of
leather
cured
in
the
sun
until
it
was
as
tough
as
steel.
Hard
was
the
word
men
used
when
they
spoke
of
Stannis,
and
hard
he
was.
Though
he
was
not
yet
five-and-thirty,
only
a
fringe
of
thin
black
hair
remained
on
his
head,
circling
behind
his
ears
like
the
shadow
of
a
crown.
His
brother,
the
late
King
Robert,
had
grown
a
beard
in
his
final
years.
Maester
Cressen
had
never
seen
it,
but
they
said
it
was
a
wild
thing,
thick
and
flerce.
As
if
in
answer,
Stannis
kept
his
own
whiskers
cropped
tight
and
short.
They
lay
like
a
blue-black
shadow
across
his
square
jaw
and
the
bony
hollows
of
his
cheeks.
His
eyes
were
open
wounds
beneath
his
heavy
brows,
a
blue
as
dark
as
the
sea
by
night.
His
mouth
would
have
given
despair
to
even
the
drollest
of
fools;
it
was
a
mouth
made
for
frowns
and
scowls
and
sharply
worded
commands,
all
thin
pale
lips
and
clenched
muscles,
a
mouth
that
had
forgotten
how
to
smile
and
had
never
known
how
to
laugh.
Sometimes
when
the
world
grew
very
still
and
silent
of
a
night,
Maester
Cressen
fancied
he
could
hear
Lord
Stannis
grinding
his
teeth
half
a
castle
away.

вЂњOnce
you
would
have
woken
me,вЂќ
the
old
man
said.

вЂњOnce
you
were
young.
Now
you
are
old
and
sick,
and
need
your
sleep.вЂќ
Stannis
had
never
learned
to
soften
his
speech,
to
dissemble
or
flatter;
he
said
what
he
thought,
and
those
that
did
not
like
it
could
be
damned.
вЂњI
knew
youвЂ™d
learn
what
Davos
had
to
say
soon
enough.
You
always
do,
donвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

вЂњI
would
be
of
no
help
to
you
if
I
did
not,вЂќ
Cressen
said.
вЂњI
met
Davos
on
the
stair.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
he
told
all,
I
suppose?
I
should
have
had
the
manвЂ™s
tongue
shortened
along
with
his
fingers.вЂќ

вЂњHe
would
have
made
you
a
poor
envoy
then.вЂќ

вЂњHe
made
me
a
poor
envoy
in
any
case.
The
storm
lords
will
not
rise
for
me.
It
seems
they
do
not
like
me,
and
the
justice
of
my
cause
means
nothing
to
them.
The
cravenly
ones
will
sit
behind
their
walls
waiting
to
see
how
the
wind
rises
and
who
is
likely
to
triumph.
The
bold
ones
have
already
declared
for
Renly.
For
Renly!вЂќ
He
spat
out
the
name
like
poison
on
his
tongue.

вЂњYour
brother
has
been
the
Lord
of
StormвЂ™s
End
these
past
thirteen
years.
These
lords
are
his
sworn
bannermenвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHis,вЂќ
Stannis
broke
in,
вЂњwhen
by
rights
they
should
be
mine.
I
never
asked
for
Dragonstone.
I
never
wanted
it.
I
took
it
because
RobertвЂ™s
enemies
were
here
and
he
commanded
me
to
root
them
out.
I
built
his
fleet
and
did
his
work,
dutiful
as
a
younger
brother
should
be
to
an
elder,
as
Renly
should
be
to
me.
And
what
was
RobertвЂ™s
thanks?
He
names
me
Lord
of
Dragonstone,
and
gives
StormвЂ™s
End
and
its
incomes
to
Renly.
StormвЂ™s
End
belonged
to
House
Baratheon
for
three
hundred
years;
by
rights
it
should
have
passed
to
me
when
Robert
took
the
Iron
Throne.вЂќ

It
was
an
old
grievance,
deeply
felt,
and
never
more
so
than
now.
Here
was
the
heart
of
his
lordвЂ™s
weakness;
for
Dragonstone,
old
and
strong
though
it
was,
commanded
the
allegiance
of
only
a
handful
of
lesser
lords,
whose
stony
island
holdings
were
too
thinly
peopled
to
yield
up
the
men
that
Stannis
needed.
Even
with
the
sellswords
he
had
brought
across
the
narrow
sea
from
the
Free
Cities
of
Myr
and
Lys,
the
host
camped
outside
his
walls
was
far
too
small
to
bring
down
the
power
of
House
Lannister.

вЂњRobert
did
you
an
injustice,вЂќ
Maester
Cressen
replied
carefully,
вЂњyet
he
had
sound
reasons.
Dragonstone
had
long
been
the
seat
of
House
Targaryen.
He
needed
a
manвЂ™s
strength
to
rule
here,
and
Renly
was
but
a
child.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
a
child
still,вЂќ
Stannis
declared,
his
anger
ringing
loud
in
the
empty
hall,
вЂњa
thieving
child
who
thinks
to
snatch
the
crown
off
my
brow.
What
has
Renly
ever
done
to
earn
a
throne?
He
sits
in
council
and
jests
with
Littlefinger,
and
at
tourneys
he
dons
his
splendid
suit
of
armor
and
allows
himself
to
be
knocked
off
his
horse
by
a
better
man.
That
is
the
sum
of
my
brother
Renly,
who
thinks
he
ought
to
be
a
king.
I
ask
you,
why
did
the
gods
inflict
me
with
brothers?вЂќ

вЂњI
cannot
answer
for
the
gods.вЂќ

вЂњYou
seldom
answer
at
all
these
days,
it
seems
to
me.
Who
maesters
for
Renly?
Perchance
I
should
send
for
him,
I
might
like
his
counsel
better.
What
do
you
think
this
maester
said
when
my
brother
decided
to
steal
my
crown?
What
counsel
did
your
colleague
offer
to
this
traitor
blood
of
mine?вЂќ

вЂњIt
would
surprise
me
if
Lord
Renly
sought
counsel,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
The
youngest
of
Lord
SteffonвЂ™s
three
sons
had
grown
into
a
man
bold
but
heedless,
who
acted
from
impulse
rather
than
calculation.
In
that,
as
in
so
much
else,
Renly
was
like
his
brother
Robert,
and
utterly
unlike
Stannis.

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Stannis
repeated
bitterly.
вЂњYou
mock
me
with
a
kingвЂ™s
style,
yet
what
am
I
king
of?
Dragonstone
and
a
few
rocks
in
the
narrow
sea,
there
is
my
kingdom.вЂќ
He
descended
the
steps
of
his
chair
to
stand
before
the
table,
his
shadow
falling
across
the
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
and
the
painted
forest
where
KingвЂ™s
Landing
now
stood.
There
he
stood,
brooding
over
the
realm
he
sought
to
claim,
so
near
at
hand
and
yet
so
far
away.
вЂњTonight
I
am
to
sup
with
my
lords
bannermen,
such
as
they
are.
Celtigar,
Velaryon,
Bar
Emmon,
the
whole
paltry
lot
of
them.
A
poor
crop,
if
truth
be
told,
but
they
are
what
my
brothers
have
left
me.
That
Lysene
pirate
Salladhor
Saan
will
be
there
with
the
latest
tally
of
what
I
owe
him,
and
Morosh
the
Myrman
will
caution
me
with
talk
of
tides
and
autumn
gales,
while
Lord
Sunglass
mutters
piously
of
the
will
of
the
Seven.
Celtigar
will
want
to
know
which
storm
lords
are
joining
us.
Velaryon
will
threaten
to
take
his
levies
home
unless
we
strike
at
once.
What
am
I
to
tell
them?
What
must
I
do
now?вЂќ

вЂњYour
true
enemies
are
the
Lannisters,
my
lord,вЂќ
Maester
Cressen
answered.
вЂњIf
you
and
your
brother
were
to
make
common
cause
against
themвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
will
not
treat
with
Renly,вЂќ
Stannis
answered
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
argument.
вЂњNot
while
he
calls
himself
a
king.вЂќ

вЂњNot
Renly,
then,вЂќ
the
maester
yielded.
His
lord
was
stubborn
and
proud;
when
he
had
set
his
mind,
there
was
no
changing
it.
вЂњOthers
might
serve
your
needs
as
well.
Eddard
StarkвЂ™s
son
has
been
proclaimed
King
in
the
North,
with
all
the
power
of
Winterfell
and
Riverrun
behind
him.вЂќ

вЂњA
green
boy,вЂќ
said
Stannis,
вЂњand
another
false
king.
Am
I
to
accept
a
broken
realm?вЂќ

вЂњSurely
half
a
kingdom
is
better
than
none,вЂќ
Cressen
said,
вЂњand
if
you
help
the
boy
avenge
his
fatherвЂ™s
murderвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
I
avenge
Eddard
Stark?
The
man
was
nothing
to
me.
Oh,
Robert
loved
him,
to
be
sure.
Loved
him
as
a
brother,
how
often
did
I
hear
that?
I
was
his
brother,
not
Ned
Stark,
but
you
would
never
have
known
it
by
the
way
he
treated
me.
I
held
StormвЂ™s
End
for
him,
watching
good
men
starve
while
Mace
Tyrell
and
Paxter
Redwyne
feasted
within
sight
of
my
walls.
Did
Robert
thank
me?
No.
He
thanked
Stark,
for
lifting
the
siege
when
we
were
down
to
rats
and
radishes.
I
built
a
fleet
at
RobertвЂ™s
command,
took
Dragonstone
in
his
name.
Did
he
take
my
hand
and
say,
Well
done,
brother,
whatever
should
I
do
without
you?
No,
he
blamed
me
for
letting
Willem
Darry
steal
away
Viserys
and
the
babe,
as
if
I
could
have
stopped
it.
I
sat
on
his
council
for
fifteen
years,
helping
Jon
Arryn
rule
his
realm
while
Robert
drank
and
whored,
but
when
Jon
died,
did
my
brother
name
me
his
Hand?
No,
he
went
galloping
off
to
his
dear
friend
Ned
Stark,
and
offered
him
the
honor.
And
small
good
it
did
either
of
them.
вЂњ

вЂњBe
that
as
it
may,
my
lord,вЂќ
Maester
Cressen
said
gently.
вЂњGreat
wrongs
have
been
done
you,
but
the
past
is
dust.
The
future
may
yet
be
won
if
you
join
with
the
Starks.
There
are
others
you
might
sound
out
as
well.
What
of
Lady
Arryn?
If
the
queen
murdered
her
husband,
surely
she
will
want
justice
for
him.
She
has
a
young
son,
Jon
ArrynвЂ™s
heir.
If
you
were
to
betroth
Shireen
to
himвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThe
boy
is
weak
and
sickly,вЂќ
Lord
Stannis
objected.
вЂњEven
his
father
saw
how
it
was,
when
he
asked
me
to
foster
him
on
Dragonstone.
Service
as
a
page
might
have
done
him
good,
but
that
damnable
Lannister
woman
had
Lord
Arryn
poisoned
before
it
could
be
done,
and
now
Lysa
hides
him
in
the
Eyrie.
SheвЂ™ll
never
part
with
the
boy,
I
promise
you
that.
вЂњ

вЂњThen
you
must
send
Shireen
to
the
Eyrie,вЂќ
the
maester
urged.
вЂњDragonstone
is
a
grim
home
for
a
child.
Let
her
fool
go
with
her,
so
she
will
have
a
familiar
face
about
her.вЂќ

вЂњFamiliar
and
hideous.вЂќ
Stannis
furrowed
his
brow
in
thought.
вЂњStillвЂ¦
perhaps
it
is
worth
the
tryingвЂ¦

вЂњMust
the
rightful
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
beg
for
help
from
widow
women
and
usurpers?вЂќ
a
womanвЂ™s
voice
asked
sharply.

Maester
Cressen
turned
sand
bowed
his
head.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
he
said,
chagrined
that
he
had
not
heard
her
enter.

Lord
Stannis
scowled.
вЂњI
do
not
beg.
Of
anyone.
Mind
you
remember
that,
woman.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
pleased
to
hear
it,
my
lord.вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
was
as
tall
as
her
husband,
thin
of
body
and
thin
of
face,
with
prominent
ears,
a
sharp
nose,
and
the
faintest
hint
of
a
mustache
on
her
upper
lip.
She
plucked
it
daily
and
cursed
it
regularly,
yet
it
never
failed
to
return.
Her
eyes
were
pale,
her
mouth
stern,
her
voice
a
whip.
She
cracked
it
now.
вЂњLady
Arryn
owes
you
her
allegiance,
as
do
the
Starks,
your
brother
Renly,
and
all
the
rest.
You
are
their
one
true
king.
It
would
not
be
fitting
to
plead
and
bargain
with
them
for
what
is
rightfully
yours
by
the
grace
of
god.вЂќ

God,
she
said,
not
gods.
The
red
woman
had
won
her,
heart
and
soul,
turning
her
from
the
gods
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
both
old
and
new,
to
worship
the
one
they
called
the
Lord
of
Light.

вЂњYour
god
can
keep
his
grace,вЂќ
said
Lord
Stannis,
who
did
not
share
his
wifeвЂ™s
fervent
new
faith.
вЂњItвЂ™s
swords
I
need,
not
blessings.
Do
you
have
an
army
hidden
somewhere
that
youвЂ™ve
not
told
me
of?вЂќ
There
was
no
affection
in
his
tone.
Stannis
had
always
been
uncomfortable
around
women,
even
his
own
wife.
When
he
had
gone
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
to
sit
on
RobertвЂ™s
council,
he
had
left
Selyse
on
Dragonstone
with
their
daughter.
His
letters
had
been
few,
his
visits
fewer;
he
did
his
duty
in
the
marriage
bed
once
or
twice
a
year,
but
took
no
joy
in
it,
and
the
sons
he
had
once
hoped
for
had
never
come.

вЂњMy
brothers
and
uncles
and
cousins
have
armies,вЂќ
she
told
him.
вЂњHouse
Florent
will
rally
to
your
banner.вЂќ

вЂњHouse
Florent
can
field
two
thousand
swords
at
best.вЂќ
It
was
said
that
Stannis
knew
the
strength
of
every
house
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
вЂњAnd
you
have
a
deal
more
faith
in
your
brothers
and
uncles
than
I
do,
my
lady.
The
Florent
lands
lie
too
close
to
Highgarden
for
your
lord
uncle
to
risk
Mace
TyrellвЂ™s
wrath.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
another
way.вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
moved
closer.
вЂњLook
out
your
windows,
my
lord.
There
is
the
sign
you
have
waited
for,
blazoned
on
the
sky.
Red,
it
is,
the
red
of
flame,
red
for
the
fiery
heart
of
the
true
god.
it
is
his
bannerвЂ”and
yours!
See
how
it
unfurls
across
the
heavens
like
a
dragonвЂ™s
hot
breath,
and
you
the
Lord
of
Dragonstone.
It
means
your
time
has
come,
Your
Grace.
Nothing
is
more
certain.
You
are
meant
to
sail
from
this
desolate
rock
as
Aegon
the
Conqueror
once
sailed,
to
sweep
all
before
you
as
he
did.
Only
say
the
word,
and
embrace
the
power
of
the
Lord
of
Light.вЂќ

вЂњHow
many
swords
will
the
Lord
of
Light
put
into
my
hand?вЂќ
Stannis
demanded
again.

вЂњAll
you
need,вЂќ
his
wife
promised,
вЂњThe
swords
of
StormвЂ™s
End
and
Highgarden
for
a
start,
and
all
their
lords
bannermen.вЂќ

вЂњDavos
would
tell
you
different,вЂќ
Stannis
said.
вЂњThose
swords
are
sworn
to
Renly.
They
love
my
charming
young
brother,
as
they
once
loved
RobertвЂ¦
and
as
they
have
never
loved
me.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
she
answered,
вЂњbut
if
Renly
should
dieвЂ¦вЂќ

Stannis
looked
at
his
lady
with
narrowed
eyes,
until
Cressen
could
not
hold
his
tongue.
вЂњIt
is
not
to
be
thought.
Your
Grace,
whatever
follies
Renly
has
committedвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњFollies?
I
call
them
treasons.вЂќ
Stannis
turned
back
to
his
wife.
вЂњMy
brother
is
young
and
strong,
and
he
has
a
vast
host
around
him,
and
these
rainbow
knights
of
his.вЂќ

вЂњMelisandre
has
gazed
into
the
flames,
and
seen
him
dead.вЂќ

Cressen
was
horrorstruck.
вЂњFratricideвЂ¦
my
lord,
this
is
evil,
unthinkableвЂ¦
please,
listen
to
me.вЂќ

Lady
Selyse
gave
him
a
measured
look.
вЂњAnd
what
will
you
tell
him,
Maester?
How
he
might
win
half
a
kingdom
if
he
goes
to
the
Starks
on
his
knees
and
sells
our
daughter
to
Lysa
Arryn?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
heard
your
counsel,
Cressen,вЂќ
Lord
Stannis
said.
вЂњNow
I
will
hear
hers.
You
are
dismissed.вЂќ

Maester
Cressen
bent
a
stiff
knee.
He
could
feel
Lady
SelyseвЂ™s
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
shuffled
slowly
across
the
room.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
stand
erect.
вЂњHelp
me,вЂќ
he
said
to
Pylos.

When
he
was
safe
back
in
his
own
rooms,
Cressen
sent
the
younger
man
away
and
limped
to
his
balcony
once
more,
to
stand
between
his
gargoyles
and
stare
out
to
sea.
One
of
Salladhor
SaanвЂ™s
warships
was
sweeping
past
the
castle,
her
gaily
striped
hull
slicing
through
the
grey-green
waters
as
her
oars
rose
and
fell.
He
watched
until
she
vanished
behind
a
headland.
Would
that
my
fears
could
vanish
so
easily.
Had
he
lived
so
long
for
this?

When
a
maester
donned
his
collar,
he
put
aside
the
hope
of
children,
yet
Cressen
had
oft
felt
a
father
nonetheless.
Robert,
Stannis,
RenlyвЂ¦
three
sons
he
had
raised
after
the
angry
sea
claimed
Lord
Steffon.
Had
he
done
so
ill
that
now
he
must
watch
one
kill
the
other?
He
could
not
allow
it,
would
not
allow
it.

The
woman
was
the
heart
of
it.
Not
the
Lady
Selyse,
the
other
one.
The
red
woman,
the
servants
had
named
her,
afraid
to
speak
her
name.
вЂњI
will
speak
her
name,вЂќ
Cressen
told
his
stone
hellhound.
вЂњMelisandre.
Her.вЂќ
Melisandre
of
Asshai,
sorceress,
shadowbinder,
and
priestess
to
RвЂ™hllor,
the
Lord
of
Light,
the
Heart
of
Fire,
the
God
of
Flame
and
Shadow.
Melisandre,
whose
madness
must
not
be
allowed
to
spread
beyond
Dragonstone.

His
chambers
seemed
dim
and
gloomy
after
the
brightness
of
the
morning.
With
fumbling
hands,
the
old
man
lit
a
candle
and
carried
it
to
the
workroom
beneath
the
rookery
stair,
where
his
ointments,
potions,
and
medicines
stood
neatly
on
their
shelves.
On
the
bottom
shelf
behind
a
row
of
salves
in
squat
clay
jars
he
found
a
vial
of
indigo
glass,
no
larger
than
his
little
finger.
It
rattled
when
he
shook
it.
Cressen
blew
away
a
layer
of
dust
and
carried
it
back
to
his
table.
Collapsing
into
his
chair,
he
pulled
the
stopper
and
spilled
out
the
vialвЂ™s
contents.
A
dozen
crystals,
no
larger
than
seeds,
rattled
across
the
parchment
heвЂ™d
been
reading.
They
shone
like
jewels
in
the
candlelight,
so
purple
that
the
maester
found
himself
thinking
that
he
had
never
truly
seen
the
color
before.

The
chain
around
his
throat
felt
very
heavy.
He
touched
one
of
the
crystals
lightly
with
the
tip
of
his
little
finger.
Such
a
small
thing
to
hold
the
power
of
life
and
death.
It
was
made
from
a
certain
plant
that
grew
only
on
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
half
a
world
away.
The
leaves
had
to
be
aged,
and
soaked
in
a
wash
of
limes
and
sugar
water
and
certain
rare
spices
from
the
Summer
Isles.
Afterward
they
could
be
discarded,
but
the
potion
must
be
thickened
with
ash
and
allowed
to
crystallize.
The
process
was
slow
and
difficult,
the
necessaries
costly
and
hard
to
acquire.
The
alchemists
of
Lys
knew
the
way
of
it,
though,
and
the
Faceless
Men
of
BraavosвЂ¦
and
the
maesters
of
his
order
as
well,
though
it
was
not
something
talked
about
beyond
the
walls
of
the
Citadel.
All
the
world
knew
that
a
maester
forged
his
silver
link
when
he
learned
the
art
of
healingвЂ”but
the
world
preferred
to
forget
that
men
who
knew
how
to
heal
also
knew
how
to
kill.

Cressen
no
longer
recalled
the
name
the
AsshaiвЂ™i
gave
the
leaf,
or
the
Lysene
poisoners
the
crystal.
In
the
Citadel,
it
was
simply
called
the
strangler.
Dissolved
in
wine,
it
would
make
the
muscles
of
a
manвЂ™s
throat
clench
tighter
than
any
fist,
shutting
off
his
windpipe.
They
said
a
victimвЂ™s
face
turned
as
purple
as
the
little
crystal
seed
from
which
his
death
was
grown,
but
so
too
did
a
man
choking
on
a
morsel
of
food.

And
this
very
night
Lord
Stannis
would
feast
his
bannermen,
his
lady
wifeвЂ¦
and
the
red
woman,
Melisandre
of
Asshai.

I
must
rest,
Maester
Cressen
told
himself.
I
must
have
all
my
strength
come
dark.
My
hands
must
not
shake,
nor
my
courage
flag.
It
is
a
dreadful
thing
I
do,
yet
it
must
be
done.
If
there
are
gods,
surely
they
will
forgive
me.
He
had
slept
so
poorly
of
late.
A
nap
would
refresh
him
for
the
ordeal
ahead.
Wearily,
he
tottered
off
to
his
bed.
Yet
when
he
closed
his
eyes,
he
could
still
see
the
light
of
the
comet,
red
and
flery
and
vividly
alive
amidst
the
darkness
of
his
dreams.
Perhaps
it
is
my
comet,
he
thought
drowsily
at
the
last,
just
before
sleep
took
him.
An
omen
of
blood,
foretelling
murderвЂ¦
yesвЂ¦

When
he
woke
it
was
full
dark,
his
bedchamber
was
black,
and
every
joint
in
his
body
ached.
Cressen
pushed
himself
up,
his
head
throbbing.
Clutching
for
his
cane,
he
rose
unsteady
to
his
feet.
So
late,
he
thought.
They
did
not
summon
me.
He
was
always
summoned
for
feasts,
seated
near
the
salt,
close
to
Lord
Stannis.
His
lordвЂ™s
face
swam
up
before
him,
not
the
man
he
was
but
the
boy
he
had
been,
standing
cold
in
the
shadows
while
the
sun
shone
on
his
elder
brother.
Whatever
he
did,
Robert
had
done
first,
and
better.
Poor
boyвЂ¦
he
must
hurry,
for
his
sake.

The
maester
found
the
crystals
where
he
had
left
them,
and
scooped
them
off
the
parchment.
Cressen
owned
no
hollow
rings,
such
as
the
poisoners
of
Lys
were
said
to
favor,
but
a
myriad
of
pockets
great
and
small
were
sewn
inside
the
loose
sleeves
of
his
robe.
He
secreted
the
strangler
seeds
in
one
of
them,
threw
open
his
door,
and
called,
вЂњPylos?
Where
are
you?вЂќ
When
he
heard
no
reply,
he
called
again,
louder.
вЂњPylos,
I
need
help.вЂќ
Still
there
came
no
answer.
That
was
queer;
the
young
maester
had
his
cell
only
a
half
turn
down
the
stair,
within
easy
earshot.

In
the
end,
Cressen
had
to
shout
for
the
servants.
вЂњMake
haste,вЂќ
he
told
them.
вЂњI
have
slept
too
long.
They
will
be
feasting
by
nowвЂ¦
drinkingвЂ¦
I
should
have
been
woken.вЂќ
What
had
happened
to
Maester
Pylos?
Truly,
he
did
not
understand.

Again
he
had
to
cross
the
long
gallery.
A
night
wind
whispered
through
the
great
windows,
sharp
with
the
smell
of
the
sea.
Torches
flickered
along
the
walls
of
Dragonstone,
and
in
the
camp
beyond,
he
could
see
hundreds
of
cookfires
burning,
as
if
a
field
of
stars
had
fallen
to
the
earth.
Above,
the
comet
blazed
red
and
malevolent.
I
am
too
old
and
wise
to
fear
such
things,
the
maester
told
himself.

The
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
were
set
in
the
mouth
of
a
stone
dragon.
He
told
the
servants
to
leave
him
outside.
It
would
be
better
to
enter
alone;
he
must
not
appear
feeble.
Leaning
heavily
on
his
cane,
Cressen
climbed
the
last
few
steps
and
hobbled
beneath
the
gateway
teeth.
A
pair
of
guardsmen
opened
the
heavy
red
doors
before
him,
unleashing
a
sudden
blast
of
noise
and
light.
Cressen
stepped
down
into
the
dragonвЂ™s
maw.

Over
the
clatter
of
knife
and
plate
and
the
low
mutter
of
table
talk,
he
heard
Patchface
singing,
вЂњвЂ¦dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,вЂќ
to
the
accompaniment
of
jangling
cowbells.
The
same
dreadful
song
heвЂ™d
sung
this
morning.
вЂњThe
shadows
come
to
stay,
my
lord,
stay
my
lord,
stay
my
lord.вЂќ
The
lower
tables
were
crowded
with
knights,
archers,
and
sellsword
captains,
tearing
apart
loaves
of
black
bread
to
soak
in
their
fish
stew.
Here
there
was
no
loud
laughter,
no
raucous
shouting
such
as
marred
the
dignity
of
other
menвЂ™s
feasts;
Lord
Stannis
did
not
permit
such.

Cressen
made
his
way
toward
the
raised
platform
where
the
lords
sat
with
the
king.
He
had
to
step
wide
around
Patchface.
Dancing,
his
bells
ringing,
the
fool
neither
saw
nor
heard
his
approach.
As
he
hopped
from
one
leg
to
the
other,
Patchface
lurched
into
Cressen,
knocking
his
cane
out
from
under
him.
They
went
crashing
down
together
amidst
the
rushes
in
a
tangle
of
arms
and
legs,
while
a
sudden
gale
of
laughter
went
up
around
them.
No
doubt
it
was
a
comical
sight.

Patchface
sprawled
half
on
top
of
him,
motley
foolвЂ™s
face
pressed
close
to
his
own.
He
had
lost
his
tin
helm
with
its
antlers
and
bells.
вЂњUnder
the
sea,
you
fall
up,вЂќ
he
declared.
вЂњI
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ
Giggling,
the
fool
rolled
off,
bounded
to
his
feet,
and
did
a
little
dance.

Trying
to
make
the
best
of
it,
the
maester
smiled
feebly
and
struggled
to
rise,
but
his
hip
was
in
such
pain
that
for
a
moment
he
was
half
afraid
that
he
had
broken
it
all
over
again.
He
felt
strong
hands
grasp
him
under
the
arms
and
lift
him
back
to
his
feet.
вЂњThank
you,
ser,вЂќ
he
murmured,
turning
to
see
which
knight
had
come
to
his
aidвЂ¦

вЂњMaester,вЂќ
said
Lady
Melisandre,
her
deep
voice
flavored
with
the
music
of
the
Jade
Sea.
вЂњYou
ought
take
more
care.вЂќ
As
ever,
she
wore
red
head
to
heel,
a
long
loose
gown
of
flowing
silk
as
bright
as
fire,
with
dagged
sleeves
and
deep
slashes
in
the
bodice
that
showed
glimpses
of
a
darker
bloodred
fabric
beneath.
Around
her
throat
was
a
red
gold
choker
tighter
than
any
maesterвЂ™s
chain,
ornamented
with
a
single
great
ruby.

Her
hair
was
not
the
orange
or
strawberry
color
of
common
red-haired
men,
but
a
deep
burnished
copper
that
shone
in
the
light
of
the
torches.
Even
her
eyes
were
redвЂ¦
but
her
skin
was
smooth
and
white,
unblemished,
pale
as
cream.
Slender
she
was,
graceful,
taller
than
most
knights,
with
full
breasts
and
narrow
waist
and
a
heart-shaped
face.
MenвЂ™s
eyes
that
once
found
her
did
not
quickly
look
away,
not
even
a
maesterвЂ™s
eyes.
Many
called
her
beautiful.
She
was
not
beautiful.
She
was
red,
and
terrible,
and
red.

вЂњIвЂ¦
thank
you,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
your
age
must
look
to
where
he
steps,вЂќ
Melisandre
said
courteously.
вЂњThe
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.вЂќ

He
knew
the
phrase,
some
prayer
of
her
faith.
It
makes
no
matter,
I
have
a
faith
of
my
own.
вЂњOnly
children
fear
the
dark,вЂќ
he
told
her.
Yet
even
as
he
said
the
words,
he
heard
Patchface
take
up
his
song
again.
вЂњThe
shadows
come
to
dance,
my
lord,
dance
my
lord,
dance
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњNow
here
is
a
riddle,вЂќ
Melisandre
said.
вЂњA
clever
fool
and
a
foolish
wise
man.вЂќ
Bending,
she
picked
up
PatchfaceвЂ™s
helm
from
where
it
had
fallen
and
set
it
on
CressenвЂ™s
head.
The
cowbells
rang
softly
as
the
tin
bucket
slid
down
over
his
ears.
вЂњA
crown
to
match
your
chain,
Lord
Maester,вЂќ
she
announced.
All
around
them,
men
were
laughing.

Cressen
pressed
his
lips
together
and
fought
to
still
his
rage.
She
thought
he
was
feeble
and
helpless,
but
she
would
learn
otherwise
before
the
night
was
done.
Old
he
might
be,
yet
he
was
still
a
maester
of
the
Citadel.
вЂњI
need
no
crown
but
truth,вЂќ
he
told
her,
removing
the
foolвЂ™s
helm
from
his
head.

вЂњThere
are
truths
in
this
world
that
are
not
taught
at
Oldtown.вЂќ
Melisandre
turned
from
him
in
a
swirl
of
red
silk
and
made
her
way
back
to
the
high
table,
where
King
Stannis
and
his
queen
were
seated.
Cressen
handed
the
antlered
tin
bucket
back
to
Patchface,
and
made
to
follow.

Maester
Pylos
sat
in
his
place.

The
old
man
could
only
stop
and
stare.
вЂњMaester
Pylos,вЂќ
he
said
at
last.
вЂњYouвЂ¦
you
did
not
wake
me.вЂќ

вЂњHis
Grace
commanded
me
to
let
you
rest.вЂќ
Pylos
had
at
least
the
grace
to
blush.
вЂњHe
told
me
you
were
not
needed
here.вЂќ

Cressen
looked
over
the
knights
and
captains
and
lords
sitting
silent.
Lord
Celtigar,
aged
and
sour,
wore
a
mantle
patterned
with
red
crabs
picked
out
in
garnets.
Handsome
Lord
Velaryon
chose
sea-green
silk,
the
white
gold
seahorse
at
his
throat
matching
his
long
fair
hair.
Lord
Bar
Emmon,
that
plump
boy
of
fourteen,
was
swathed
in
purple
velvet
trimmed
with
white
seal,
Ser
Axell
Florent
remained
homely
even
in
russet
and
fox
fur,
pious
Lord
Sunglass
wore
moonstones
at
throat
and
wrist
and
finger,
and
the
Lysene
captain
Salladhor
Saan
was
a
sunburst
of
scarlet
satin,
gold,
and
jewels.
Only
Ser
Davos
dressed
simply,
in
brown
doublet
and
green
wool
mantle,
and
only
Ser
Davos
met
his
gaze,
with
pity
in
his
eyes.

вЂњYou
are
too
ill
and
too
confused
to
be
of
use
to
me,
old
man.вЂќ
It
sounded
so
like
Lord
StannisвЂ™s
voice,
but
it
could
not
be,
it
could
not.
вЂњPylos
will
counsel
me
henceforth.
Already
he
works
with
the
ravens,
since
you
can
no
longer
climb
to
the
rookery.
I
will
not
have
you
kill
yourself
in
my
service.вЂќ

Maester
Cressen
blinked.
Stannis,
my
lord,
my
sad
sullen
boy,
son
I
never
had,
you
must
not
do
this,
donвЂ™t
you
know
how
I
have
cared
for
you,
lived
for
you,
loved
you
despite
all?
Yes,
loved
you,
better
than
Robert
even,
or
Renly,
for
you
were
the
one
unloved,
the
one
who
needed
me
most.
Yet
all
he
said
was,
вЂњAs
you
command,
my
lord,
butвЂ¦
but
I
am
hungry.
Might
not
I
have
a
place
at
your
table?вЂќ
At
your
side,
I
belong
at
your
sideвЂ¦

Ser
Davos
rose
from
the
bench.
вЂњI
should
be
honored
if
the
maester
would
sit
here
beside
me,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.вЂќ
Lord
Stannis
turned
away
to
say
something
to
Melisandre,
who
had
seated
herself
at
his
right
hand,
in
the
place
of
high
honor.
Lady
Selyse
was
on
his
left,
flashing
a
smile
as
bright
and
brittle
as
her
jewels.

Too
far,
Cressen
thought
dully,
looking
at
where
Ser
Davos
was
seated.
Half
of
the
lords
bannermen
were
between
the
smuggler
and
the
high
table.
I
must
be
closer
to
her
if
I
am
to
get
the
strangler
into
her
cup,
yet
how?

Patchface
was
capering
about
as
the
maester
made
his
slow
way
around
the
table
to
Davos
Seaworth.
вЂњHere
we
eat
fish,вЂќ
the
fool
declared
happily,
waving
a
cod
about
like
a
scepter.
вЂњUnder
the
sea,
the
fish
eat
us.
I
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

Ser
Davos
moved
aside
to
make
room
on
the
bench.
вЂњWe
all
should
be
in
motley
tonight,вЂќ
he
said
gloomily
as
Cressen
seated
himself,
вЂњfor
this
is
foolвЂ™s
business
weвЂ™re
about.
The
red
woman
has
seen
victory
in
her
flames,
so
Stannis
means
to
press
his
claim,
no
matter
what
the
numbers.
Before
sheвЂ™s
done
weвЂ™re
all
like
to
see
what
Patchface
saw,
I
fearвЂ”the
bottom
of
the
sea.вЂќ

Cressen
slid
his
hands
up
into
his
sleeves
as
if
for
warmth.
His
fingers
found
the
hard
lumps
the
crystals
made
in
the
wool.
вЂњLord
Stannis.вЂќ

Stannis
turned
from
the
red
woman,
but
it
was
Lady
Selyse
who
replied.
вЂњKing
Stannis.
You
forget
yourself,
Maester.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
old,
his
mind
wanders,вЂќ
the
king
told
her
gruffly.
вЂњWhat
is
it,
Cressen?
Speak
your
mind.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
intend
to
sail,
it
is
vital
that
you
make
common
cause
with
Lord
Stark
and
Lady
ArrynвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
make
common
cause
with
no
one,вЂќ
Stannis
Baratheon
said.

вЂњNo
more
than
light
makes
common
cause
with
darkness.вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
took
his
hand.

Stannis
nodded.
вЂњThe
Starks
seek
to
steal
half
my
kingdom,
even
as
the
Lannisters
have
stolen
my
throne
and
my
own
sweet
brother
the
swords
and
service
and
strongholds
that
are
mine
by
rights.
They
are
all
usurpers,
and
they
are
all
my
enemies.вЂќ

I
have
lost
him,
Cressen
thought,
despairing.
If
only
he
could
somehow
approach
Melisandre
unseenвЂ¦
he
needed
but
an
instantвЂ™s
access
to
her
cup.
вЂњYou
are
the
rightful
heir
to
your
brother
Robert,
the
true
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,вЂќ
he
said
desperately,
вЂњbut
even
so,
you
cannot
hope
to
triumph
without
allies.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has
an
ally,вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
said.
вЂњRвЂ™hllor,
the
Lord
of
Light,
the
Heart
of
Fire,
the
God
of
Flame
and
Shadow.вЂќ

вЂњGods
make
uncertain
allies
at
best,вЂќ
the
old
man
insisted,
вЂњand
that
one
has
no
power
here.вЂќ

вЂњYou
think
not?вЂќ
The
ruby
at
MelisandreвЂ™s
throat
caught
the
light
as
she
turned
her
head,
and
for
an
instant
it
seemed
to
glow
bright
as
the
comet.
вЂњIf
you
will
speak
such
folly,
Maester,
you
ought
to
wear
your
crown
again.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
agreed.
вЂњPatchesвЂ™s
helm.
It
suits
you
well,
old
man.
Put
it
on
again,
I
command
you.вЂќ

вЂњUnder
the
sea,
no
one
wears
hats,вЂќ
Patchface
said.
вЂњI
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

Lord
StannisвЂ™s
eyes
were
shadowed
beneath
his
heavy
brow,
his
mouth
tight
as
his
jaw
worked
silently.
He
always
ground
his
teeth
when
he
was
angry.
вЂњFool,вЂќ
he
growled
at
last,
вЂњmy
lady
wife
commands.
Give
Cressen
your
helm.вЂќ

No,
the
old
maester
thought,
this
is
not
you,
not
your
way,
you
were
always
just,
always
hard
yet
never
cruel,
never,
you
did
not
understand
mockery,
no
more
than
you
understood
laughter.

Patchface
danced
closer,
his
cowbells
ringing,
clang-a-lang,
ding-ding,
clink-clank-clink-clank.
The
maester
sat
silent
while
the
fool
set
the
antlered
bucket
on
his
brow.
Cressen
bowed
his
head
beneath
the
weight.
His
bells
clanged.
вЂњPerhaps
he
ought
sing
his
counsel
henceforth,вЂќ
Lady
Selyse
said.

вЂњYou
go
too
far,
woman,вЂќ
Lord
Stannis
said.
вЂњHe
is
an
old
man,
and
heвЂ™s
served
me
well.вЂќ

And
I
will
serve
you
to
the
last,
my
sweet
lord,
my
poor
lonely
son,
Cressen
thought,
for
suddenly
he
saw
the
way.
Ser
DavosвЂ™s
cup
was
before
him,
still
half-full
of
sour
red.
He
found
a
hard
flake
of
crystal
in
his
sleeve,
held
it
tight
between
thumb
and
forefinger
as
he
reached
for
the
cup.
Smooth
motions,
deft,
I
must
not
fumble
now,
he
prayed,
and
the
gods
were
kind.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye,
his
fingers
were
empty.
His
hands
had
not
been
so
steady
for
years,
nor
half
so
fluid.
Davos
saw,
but
no
one
else,
he
was
certain.
Cup
in
hand,
he
rose
to
his
feet.
вЂњMayhaps
I
have
been
a
fool.
Lady
Melisandre,
will
you
share
a
cup
of
wine
with
me?
A
cup
in
honor
of
your
god,
your
Lord
of
Light?
A
cup
to
toast
his
power?
вЂњ

The
red
woman
studied
him.
вЂњIf
you
wish.вЂќ

He
could
feel
them
all
watching
him.
Davos
clutched
at
him
as
he
left
the
bench,
catching
his
sleeve
with
the
fingers
that
Lord
Stannis
had
shortened.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing?вЂќ
he
whispered.

вЂњA
thing
that
must
be
done,вЂќ
Maester
Cressen
answered,
вЂњfor
the
sake
of
the
realm,
and
the
soul
of
my
lord.вЂќ
He
shook
off
DavosвЂ™s
hand,
spilling
a
drop
of
wine
on
the
rushes.

She
met
him
beneath
the
high
table
with
every
manвЂ™s
eyes
upon
them.
But
Cressen
saw
only
her.
Red
silk,
red
eyes,
the
ruby
red
at
her
throat,
red
lips
curled
in
a
faint
smile
as
she
put
her
hand
atop
his
own,
around
the
cup.
Her
skin
felt
hot,
feverish.
вЂњIt
is
not
too
late
to
spill
the
wine,
Maester.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
whispered
hoarsely.
вЂњNo.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.вЂќ
Melisandre
of
Asshai
took
the
cup
from
his
hands
and
drank
long
and
deep.
There
was
only
half
a
swallow
of
wine
remaining
when
she
offered
it
back
to
him.
вЂњAnd
now
you.вЂќ

His
hands
were
shaking,
but
he
made
himself
be
strong.
A
maester
of
the
Citadel
must
not
be
afraid.
The
wine
was
sour
on
his
tongue.
He
let
the
empty
cup
drop
from
his
fingers
to
shatter
on
the
floor.
вЂњHe
does
have
power
here,
my
lord,вЂќ
the
woman
said.
вЂњAnd
fire
cleanses.вЂќ
At
her
throat,
the
ruby
shimmered
redly.

Cressen
tried
to
reply,
but
his
words
caught
in
his
throat.
His
cough
became
a
terrible
thin
whistle
as
he
strained
to
suck
in
air.
Iron
fingers
tightened
round
his
neck.
As
he
sank
to
his
knees,
still
he
shook
his
head,
denying
her,
denying
her
power,
denying
her
magic,
denying
her
god.
And
the
cowbells
peeled
in
his
antlers,
singing
fool,
fool,
fool
while
the
red
woman
looked
down
on
him
in
pity,
the
candle
flames
dancing
in
her
red
red
eyes.





ARYA

At
Winterfell
they
had
called
her
вЂњArya
HorsefaceвЂќ
and
sheвЂ™d
thought
nothing
could
be
worse,
but
that
was
before
the
orphan
boy
Lommy
Greenhands
had
named
her
вЂњLumpyhead.вЂќ

Her
head
felt
lumpy
when
she
touched
it.
When
Yoren
had
dragged
her
into
that
alley
sheвЂ™d
thought
he
meant
to
kill
her,
but
the
sour
old
man
had
only
held
her
tight,
sawing
through
her
mats
and
tangles
with
his
dagger.
She
remembered
how
the
breeze
sent
the
fistfuls
of
dirty
brown
hair
skittering
across
the
paving
stones,
toward
the
sept
where
her
father
had
died.
вЂњIвЂ™m
taking
men
and
boys
from
the
city,вЂќ
Yoren
growled
as
the
sharp
steel
scraped
at
her
head.
вЂњNow
you
hold
still,
boy.вЂќ
By
the
time
he
had
finished,
her
scalp
was
nothing
but
tufts
and
stubble.

Afterward
he
told
her
that
from
there
to
Winterfell
sheвЂ™d
be
Arry
the
orphan
boy.
вЂњGate
shouldnвЂ™t
be
hard,
but
the
roadвЂ™s
another
matter.
You
got
a
long
way
to
go
in
bad
company.
I
got
thirty
this
time,
men
and
boys
all
bound
for
the
Wall,
and
donвЂ™t
be
thinking
theyвЂ™re
like
that
bastard
brother
oвЂ™
yours.вЂќ
He
shook
her.
вЂњLord
Eddard
gave
me
pick
oвЂ™
the
dungeons,
and
I
didnвЂ™t
find
no
little
lordlings
down
there.
This
lot,
half
oвЂ™
them
would
turn
you
over
to
the
queen
quick
as
spit
for
a
pardon
and
maybe
a
few
silvers.
The
other
halfвЂ™d
do
the
same,
only
theyвЂ™d
rape
you
first.
So
you
keep
to
yourself
and
make
your
water
in
the
woods,
alone.
ThatвЂ™ll
be
the
hardest
part,
the
pissing,
so
donвЂ™t
drink
no
moreвЂ™n
you
need.вЂќ

Leaving
KingвЂ™s
Landing
was
easy,
just
like
heвЂ™d
said.
The
Lannister
guardsmen
on
the
gate
were
stopping
everyone,
but
Yoren
called
one
by
name
and
their
wagons
were
waved
through.
No
one
spared
Arya
a
glance.
They
were
looking
for
a
highborn
girl,
daughter
of
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand,
not
for
a
skinny
boy
with
his
hair
chopped
off.
Arya
never
looked
back.
She
wished
the
Rush
would
rise
and
wash
the
whole
city
away,
Flea
Bottom
and
the
Red
Keep
and
the
Great
Sept
and
everything,
and
everyone
too,
especially
Prince
Joffrey
and
his
mother.
But
she
knew
it
wouldnвЂ™t,
and
anyhow
Sansa
was
still
in
the
city
and
would
wash
away
too.
When
she
remembered
that,
Arya
decided
to
wish
for
Winterfell
instead.

Yoren
was
wrong
about
the
pissing,
though.
That
wasnвЂ™t
the
hardest
part
at
all;
Lommy
Greenhands
and
Hot
Pie
were
the
hardest
part.
Orphan
boys.
Yoren
had
plucked
some
from
the
streets
with
promises
of
food
for
their
bellies
and
shoes
for
their
feet.
The
rest
heвЂ™d
found
in
chains.
вЂњThe
Watch
needs
good
men,вЂќ
he
told
them
as
they
set
out,
вЂњbut
you
lot
will
have
to
do.вЂќ

Yoren
had
taken
grown
men
from
the
dungeons
as
well,
thieves
and
poachers
and
rapers
and
the
like.
The
worst
were
the
three
heвЂ™d
found
in
the
black
cells
who
must
have
scared
even
him,
because
he
kept
them
fettered
hand
and
foot
in
the
back
of
a
wagon,
and
vowed
theyвЂ™d
stay
in
irons
all
the
way
to
the
Wall.
One
had
no
nose,
only
the
hole
in
his
face
where
it
had
been
cut
off,
and
the
gross
fat
bald
one
with
the
pointed
teeth
and
the
weeping
sores
on
his
cheeks
had
eyes
like
nothing
human.

They
took
five
wagons
out
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
laden
with
supplies
for
the
Wall:
hides
and
bolts
of
cloth,
bars
of
pig
iron,
a
cage
of
ravens,
books
and
paper
and
ink,
a
bale
of
sourleaf,
jars
of
oil,
and
chests
of
medicine
and
spices.
Teams
of
plow
horses
pulled
the
wagons,
and
Yoren
had
bought
two
coursers
and
a
half-dozen
donkeys
for
the
boys.
Arya
would
have
preferred
a
real
horse,
but
the
donkey
was
better
than
riding
on
a
wagon.

The
men
paid
her
no
mind,
but
she
was
not
so
lucky
with
the
boys.
She
was
two
years
younger
than
the
youngest
orphan,
not
to
mention
smaller
and
skinnier,
and
Lommy
and
Hot
Pie
took
her
silence
to
mean
she
was
scared,
or
stupid,
or
deaf.
вЂњLook
at
that
sword
LumpyheadвЂ™s
got
there,вЂќ
Lommy
said
one
morning
as
they
made
their
plodding
way
past
orchards
and
wheat
fields.
HeвЂ™d
been
a
dyerвЂ™s
apprentice
before
he
was
caught
stealing,
and
his
arms
were
mottled
green
to
the
elbow.
When
he
laughed
he
brayed
like
the
donkeys
they
were
riding.
вЂњWhereвЂ™s
a
gutter
rat
like
Lumpyhead
get
him
a
sword?вЂќ

Arya
chewed
her
lip
sullenly.
She
could
see
the
back
of
YorenвЂ™s
faded
black
cloak
up
ahead
of
the
wagons,
but
she
was
determined
not
to
go
crying
to
him
for
help.

вЂњMaybe
heвЂ™s
a
little
squire,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
put
in.
His
mother
had
been
a
baker
before
she
died,
and
heвЂ™d
pushed
her
cart
through
the
streets
all
day,
shouting
вЂњHot
pies!
Hot
pies!вЂќ
вЂњSome
lordy
lordвЂ™s
little
squire
boy,
thatвЂ™s
it.вЂќ

вЂњHe
ainвЂ™t
no
squire,
look
at
him.
I
bet
thatвЂ™s
not
even
a
real
sword.
I
bet
itвЂ™s
just
some
play
sword
made
of
tin.вЂќ

Arya
hated
them
making
fun
of
Needle.
вЂњItвЂ™s
castle-forged
steel,
you
stupid,вЂќ
she
snapped,
turning
in
the
saddle
to
glare
at
them,
вЂњand
you
better
shut
your
mouth.вЂќ

The
orphan
boys
hooted.
вЂњWhereвЂ™d
you
get
a
blade
like
that,
Lumpyface?вЂќ
Hot
Pie
wanted
to
know.

вЂњLumpyhead,вЂќ
corrected
Lommy.
вЂњHe
probвЂ™ly
stole
it.вЂќ

вЂњI
did
not!вЂќ
she
shouted.
Jon
Snow
had
given
her
Needle.
Maybe
she
had
to
let
them
call
her
Lumpyhead,
but
she
wasnвЂ™t
going
to
let
them
call
Jon
a
thief.

вЂњIf
he
stole
it,
we
could
take
it
off
him,вЂќ
said
Hot
Pie.
вЂњItвЂ™s
not
his
anyhow.
I
could
use
me
a
sword
like
that.вЂќ

Lommy
egged
him
on.
вЂњGo
on,
take
it
off
him,
I
dare
you.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
kicked
his
donkey,
riding
closer.
вЂњHey,
Lumpyface,
you
gimme
that
sword.вЂќ
His
hair
was
the
color
of
straw,
his
fat
face
all
sunburnt
and
peeling.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
know
how
to
use
it.вЂќ

Yes
I
do,
Arya
could
have
said.
I
killed
a
boy,
a
fat
boy
like
you,
I
stabbed
him
in
the
belly
and
he
died,
and
IвЂ™ll
kill
you
too
if
you
donвЂ™t
let
me
alone.
Only
she
did
not
dare.
Yoren
didnвЂ™t
know
about
the
stableboy,
but
she
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
if
he
found
out.
Arya
was
pretty
sure
that
some
of
the
other
men
were
killers
too,
the
three
in
the
manacles
for
sure,
but
the
queen
wasnвЂ™t
looking
for
them,
so
it
wasnвЂ™t
the
same.

вЂњLook
at
him,вЂќ
brayed
Lommy
Greenhands.
вЂњI
bet
heвЂ™s
going
to
cry
now.
You
want
to
cry,
Lumpyhead?вЂќ

She
had
cried
in
her
sleep
the
night
before,
dreaming
of
her
father.
Come
morning,
sheвЂ™d
woken
red-eyed
and
dry,
and
could
not
have
shed
another
tear
if
her
life
had
hung
on
it.

вЂњHeвЂ™s
going
to
wet
his
pants,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
suggested.

вЂњLeave
him
be,вЂќ
said
the
boy
with
the
shaggy
black
hair
who
rode
behind
them.
Lommy
had
named
him
the
Bull,
on
account
of
this
horned
helm
he
had
that
he
polished
all
the
time
but
never
wore.
Lommy
didnвЂ™t
dare
mock
the
Bull.
He
was
older,
and
big
for
his
age,
with
a
broad
chest
and
strong-looking
arms.

вЂњYou
better
give
Hot
Pie
the
sword,
Arry,вЂќ
Lommy
said.
вЂњHot
Pie
wants
it
bad.
He
kicked
a
boy
to
death.
HeвЂ™ll
do
the
same
to
you,
I
bet.вЂќ

вЂњI
knocked
him
down
and
I
kicked
him
in
the
balls,
and
I
kept
kicking
him
there
until
he
was
dead,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
boasted.
вЂњI
kicked
him
all
to
pieces.
His
balls
were
broke
open
and
bloody
and
his
cock
turned
black.
You
better
gimme
the
sword.вЂќ

Arya
slid
her
practice
sword
from
her
belt.
вЂњYou
can
have
this
one,вЂќ
she
told
Hot
Pie,
not
wanting
to
fight.

вЂњThatвЂ™s
just
some
stick.вЂќ
He
rode
nearer
and
tried
to
reach
over
for
NeedleвЂ™s
hilt.

Arya
made
the
stick
whistle
as
she
laid
the
wood
across
his
donkeyвЂ™s
hindquarters.
The
animal
hawed
and
bucked,
dumping
Hot
Pie
on
the
ground.
She
vaulted
off
her
own
donkey
and
poked
him
in
the
gut
as
he
tried
to
get
up
and
he
sat
back
down
with
a
grunt.
Then
she
whacked
him
across
the
face
and
his
nose
made
a
crack
like
a
branch
breaking.
Blood
dribbled
from
his
nostrils.
When
Hot
Pie
began
to
wail,
Arya
whirled
toward
Lommy
Greenhands,
who
was
sitting
on
his
donkey
openmouthed.
вЂњYou
want
some
sword
too?вЂќ
she
yelled,
but
he
didnвЂ™t.
He
raised
dyed
green
hands
in
front
of
his
face
and
squealed
at
her
to
get
away.

The
Bull
shouted,
вЂњBehind
you,вЂќ
and
Arya
spun.
Hot
Pie
was
on
his
knees,
his
fist
closing
around
a
big
jagged
rock.
She
let
him
throw
it,
ducking
her
head
as
it
sailed
past.
Then
she
flew
at
him.
He
raised
a
hand
and
she
hit
it,
and
then
his
cheek,
and
then
his
knee.
He
grabbed
for
her,
and
she
danced
aside
and
bounced
the
wood
off
the
back
of
his
head.
He
fell
down
and
got
up
and
stumbled
after
her,
his
red
face
all
smeared
with
dirt
and
blood.
Arya
slid
into
a
water
dancerвЂ™s
stance
and
waited.
When
he
came
close
enough,
she
lunged,
right
between
his
legs,
so
hard
that
if
her
wooden
sword
had
had
a
point
it
would
have
come
out
between
his
butt
cheeks.

By
the
time
Yoren
pulled
her
off
him,
Hot
Pie
was
sprawled
out
on
the
ground
with
his
breeches
brown
and
smelly,
crying
as
Arya
whapped
him
over
and
over
and
over.
вЂњEnough,вЂќ
the
black
brother
roared,
prying
the
stick
sword
from
her
fingers,
вЂњyou
want
to
kill
the
fool?вЂќ
When
Lommy
and
some
others
started
to
squeal,
the
old
man
turned
on
them
too.
вЂњShut
your
mouths,
or
IвЂ™ll
be
shutting
them
for
you.
Any
more
oвЂ™
this,
IвЂ™ll
tie
you
lot
behind
the
wagons
and
drag
you
to
the
Wall.вЂќ
He
spat.
вЂњAnd
that
goes
twice
for
you,
Arry.
You
come
with
me,
boy.
Now.вЂќ

They
were
all
looking
at
her,
even
the
three
chained
and
manacled
in
the
back
of
the
wagon.
The
fat
one
snapped
his
pointy
teeth
together
and
hissed,
but
Arya
ignored
him.

The
old
man
dragged
her
well
off
the
road
into
a
tangle
of
trees,
cursing
and
muttering
all
the
while.
вЂњIf
I
had
a
thimble
oвЂ™
sense,
I
wouldвЂ™ve
left
you
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
You
hear
me,
boy?вЂќ
He
always
snarled
that
word,
putting
a
bite
in
it
so
she
would
be
certain
to
hear.
вЂњUnlace
your
breeches
and
pull
вЂem
down.
Go
on,
thereвЂ™s
no
one
here
to
see.
Do
it.вЂќ

Sullenly,
Arya
did
as
he
said.
вЂњOver
there,
against
the
oak.
Yes,
like
that.вЂќ
She
wrapped
her
arms
around
the
trunk
and
pressed
her
face
to
the
rough
wood.
вЂњYou
scream
now.
You
scream
loud.вЂќ

I
wonвЂ™t,
Arya
thought
stubbornly,
but
when
Yoren
laid
the
wood
against
the
back
of
her
bare
thighs,
the
shriek
burst
out
of
her
anyway.
вЂњThink
that
hurt?вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњTry
this
one.вЂќ
The
stick
came
whistling.
Arya
shrieked
again,
clutching
the
tree
to
keep
from
falling.
вЂњOne
more.вЂќ
She
held
on
tight,
chewing
her
lip,
flinching
when
she
heard
it
coming.
The
stroke
made
her
jump
and
howl.
I
wonвЂ™t
cry,
she
thought,
I
wonвЂ™t
do
that.
IвЂ™m
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
our
sigil
is
the
direwolf,
direwolves
donвЂ™t
cry.
She
could
feel
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
running
down
her
left
leg.
Her
thighs
and
cheeks
were
ablaze
with
pain.
вЂњMight
be
I
got
your
attention
now,вЂќ
Yoren
said.
вЂњNext
time
you
take
that
stick
to
one
of
your
brothers,
youвЂ™ll
get
twice
what
you
give,
you
hear
me?
Now
cover
yourself.вЂќ

TheyвЂ™re
not
my
brothers,
Arya
thought
as
she
bent
to
yank
up
her
breeches,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
say
so.
Her
hands
fumbled
with
her
belt
and
laces.

Yoren
was
looking
at
her.
вЂњYou
hurt?вЂќ

Calm
as
still
water,
she
told
herself,
the
way
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her.
вЂњSome.вЂќ

He
spat.
вЂњThat
pie
boyвЂ™s
hurting
worse.
It
wasnвЂ™t
him
as
killed
your
father,
girl,
nor
that
thieving
Lommy
neither.
Hitting
them
wonвЂ™t
bring
him
back.вЂќ

вЂњI
know,вЂќ
Arya
muttered
sullenly.

вЂњHereвЂ™s
something
you
donвЂ™t
know.
It
wasnвЂ™t
supposed
to
happen
like
it
did.
I
was
set
to
leave,
wagons
bought
and
loaded,
and
a
man
comes
with
a
boy
for
me,
and
a
purse
of
coin,
and
a
message,
never
mind
who
itвЂ™s
from.
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
to
take
the
black,
he
says
to
me,
wait,
heвЂ™ll
be
going
with
you.
Why
dвЂ™you
think
I
was
there?
Only
something
went
queer.вЂќ

вЂњJoffrey,вЂќ
Arya
breathed.
вЂњSomeone
should
kill
him!вЂќ

вЂњSomeone
will,
but
it
wonвЂ™t
be
me,
nor
you
neither.вЂќ
Yoren
tossed
back
her
stick
sword.
вЂњGot
sourleaf
back
at
the
wagons,вЂќ
he
said
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
road.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
chew
some,
itвЂ™ll
help
with
the
sting.вЂќ

It
did
help,
some,
though
the
taste
of
it
was
foul
and
it
made
her
spit
look
like
blood.
Even
so,
she
walked
for
the
rest
of
that
day,
and
the
day
after,
and
the
day
after
that,
too
raw
to
sit
a
donkey.
Hot
Pie
was
worse
off;
Yoren
had
to
shift
some
barrels
around
so
he
could
lie
in
the
back
of
a
wagon
on
some
sacks
of
barley,
and
he
whimpered
every
time
the
wheels
hit
a
rock.
Lommy
Greenhands
wasnвЂ™t
even
hurt,
yet
he
stayed
as
far
away
from
Arya
as
he
could
get.
вЂњEvery
time
you
look
at
him,
he
twitches,вЂќ
the
Bull
told
her
as
she
walked
beside
his
donkey.
She
did
not
answer.
It
seemed
safer
not
to
talk
to
anyone.

That
night
she
lay
upon
her
thin
blanket
on
the
hard
ground,
staring
up
at
the
great
red
comet.
The
comet
was
splendid
and
scary
all
at
once.
вЂњThe
Red
Sword,вЂќ
the
Bull
named
it;
he
claimed
it
looked
like
a
sword,
the
blade
still
red-hot
from
the
forge.
When
Arya
squinted
the
right
way
she
could
see
the
sword
too,
only
it
wasnвЂ™t
a
new
sword,
it
was
Ice,
her
fatherвЂ™s
greatsword,
all
ripply
Valyrian
steel,
and
the
red
was
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
blood
on
the
blade
after
Ser
Ilyn
the
KingвЂ™s
Justice
had
cut
off
his
head.
Yoren
had
made
her
look
away
when
it
happened,
yet
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
comet
looked
like
Ice
must
have,
after.

When
at
last
she
slept,
she
dreamed
of
home.
The
kingsroad
wound
its
way
past
Winterfell
on
its
way
to
the
Wall,
and
Yoren
had
promised
heвЂ™d
leave
her
there
with
no
one
any
wiser
about
who
sheвЂ™d
been.
She
yearned
to
see
her
mother
again,
and
Robb
and
Bran
and
RickonвЂ¦
but
it
was
Jon
Snow
she
thought
of
most.
She
wished
somehow
they
could
come
to
the
Wall
before
Winterfell,
so
Jon
might
muss
up
her
hair
and
call
her
вЂњlittle
sister.вЂќ
SheвЂ™d
tell
him,
вЂњI
missed
you,вЂќ
and
heвЂ™d
say
it
too
at
the
very
same
moment,
the
way
they
always
used
to
say
things
together.
She
would
have
liked
that.
She
would
have
liked
that
better
than
anything.





SANSA

The
morning
of
King
JoffreyвЂ™s
name
day
dawned
bright
and
windy,
with
the
long
tail
of
the
great
comet
visible
through
the
high
scuttling
clouds.
Sansa
was
watching
it
from
her
tower
window
when
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
arrived
to
escort
her
down
to
the
tourney
grounds.
вЂњWhat
do
you
think
it
means?вЂќ
she
asked
him.

вЂњGlory
to
your
betrothed,вЂќ
Ser
Arys
answered
at
once.
вЂњSee
how
it
flames
across
the
sky
today
on
His
GraceвЂ™s
name
day,
as
if
the
gods
themselves
had
raised
a
banner
in
his
honor.
The
smallfolk
have
named
it
King
JoffreyвЂ™s
Comet.вЂќ

Doubtless
that
was
what
they
told
Joffrey;
Sansa
was
not
so
sure.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
heard
servants
calling
it
the
DragonвЂ™s
Tail.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Joffrey
sits
where
Aegon
the
Dragon
once
sat,
in
the
castle
built
by
his
son,вЂќ
Ser
Arys
said.
вЂњHe
is
the
dragonвЂ™s
heirвЂ”and
crimson
is
the
color
of
House
Lannister,
another
sign.
This
comet
is
sent
to
herald
JoffreyвЂ™s
ascent
to
the
throne,
I
have
no
doubt.
It
means
that
he
will
triumph
over
his
enemies.вЂќ

Is
it
true?
she
wondered.
Would
the
gods
be
so
cruel?
Her
mother
was
one
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
enemies
now,
her
brother
Robb
another.
Her
father
had
died
by
the
kingвЂ™s
command.
Must
Robb
and
her
lady
mother
die
next?
The
comet
was
red,
but
Joffrey
was
Baratheon
as
much
as
Lannister,
and
their
sigil
was
a
black
stag
on
a
golden
field.
ShouldnвЂ™t
the
gods
have
sent
Joff
a
golden
comet?

Sansa
closed
the
shutters
and
turned
sharply
away
from
the
window.
вЂњYou
look
very
lovely
today,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Arys
said.

вЂњThank
you,
ser.вЂќ
Knowing
that
Joffrey
would
require
her
to
attend
the
tourney
in
his
honor,
Sansa
had
taken
special
care
with
her
face
and
clothes.
She
wore
a
gown
of
pale
purple
silk
and
a
moonstone
hair
net
that
had
been
a
gift
from
Joffrey.
The
gown
had
long
sleeves
to
hide
the
bruises
on
her
arms.
Those
were
JoffreyвЂ™s
gifts
as
well.
When
they
told
him
that
Robb
had
been
proclaimed
King
in
the
North,
his
rage
had
been
a
fearsome
thing,
and
he
had
sent
Ser
Boros
to
beat
her.

вЂњShall
we
go?вЂќ
Ser
Arys
offered
his
arm
and
she
let
him
lead
her
from
her
chamber.
If
she
must
have
one
of
the
Kingsguard
dogging
her
steps,
Sansa
preferred
that
it
be
him.
Ser
Boros
was
short-tempered,
Ser
Meryn
cold,
and
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
strange
dead
eyes
made
her
uneasy,
while
Ser
Preston
treated
her
like
a
lackwit
child.
Arys
Oakheart
was
courteous,
and
would
talk
to
her
cordially.
Once
he
even
objected
when
Joffrey
commanded
him
to
hit
her.
He
did
hit
her
in
the
end,
but
not
hard
as
Ser
Meryn
or
Ser
Boros
might
have,
and
at
least
he
had
argued.
The
others
obeyed
without
questionвЂ¦
except
for
the
Hound,
but
Joff
never
asked
the
Hound
to
punish
her.
He
used
the
other
five
for
that.

Ser
Arys
had
light
brown
hair
and
a
face
that
was
not
unpleasant
to
look
upon.
Today
he
made
quite
the
dashing
figure,
with
his
white
silk
cloak
fastened
at
the
shoulder
by
a
golden
leaf,
and
a
spreading
oak
tree
worked
upon
the
breast
of
his
tunic
in
shining
gold
thread.
вЂњWho
do
you
think
will
win
the
dayвЂ™s
honors?вЂќ
Sansa
asked
as
they
descended
the
steps
arm
in
arm.

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
Ser
Arys
answered,
smiling.
вЂњYet
I
fear
the
triumph
will
have
no
savor.
This
will
be
a
small
field,
and
poor.
No
more
than
two
score
will
enter
the
lists,
including
squires
and
freeriders.
There
is
small
honor
in
unhorsing
green
boys.вЂќ

The
last
tourney
had
been
different,
Sansa
reflected.
King
Robert
had
staged
it
in
her
fatherвЂ™s
honor.
High
lords
and
fabled
champions
had
come
from
all
over
the
realm
to
compete,
and
the
whole
city
had
turned
out
to
watch.
She
remembered
the
splendor
of
it:
the
field
of
pavilions
along
the
river
with
a
knightвЂ™s
shield
hung
before
each
door,
the
long
rows
of
silken
pennants
waving
in
the
wind,
the
gleam
of
sunlight
on
bright
steel
and
gilded
spurs.
The
days
had
rung
to
the
sounds
of
trumpets
and
pounding
hooves,
and
the
nights
had
been
full
of
feasts
and
song.
Those
had
been
the
most
magical
days
of
her
life,
but
they
seemed
a
memory
from
another
age
now.
Robert
Baratheon
was
dead,
and
her
father
as
well,
beheaded
for
a
traitor
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
Now
there
were
three
kings
in
the
land,
and
war
raged
beyond
the
Trident
while
the
city
filled
with
desperate
men.
Small
wonder
that
they
had
to
hold
JoffвЂ™s
tournament
behind
the
thick
stone
walls
of
the
Red
Keep.

вЂњWill
the
queen
attend,
do
you
think?вЂќ
Sansa
always
felt
safer
when
Cersei
was
there
to
restrain
her
son.

вЂњI
fear
not,
my
lady.
The
council
is
meeting,
some
urgent
business.вЂќ
Ser
Arys
dropped
his
voice.
вЂњLord
Tywin
has
gone
to
ground
at
Harrenhal
instead
of
bringing
his
army
to
the
city
as
the
queen
commanded.
Her
Grace
is
furious.вЂќ
He
fell
silent
as
a
column
of
Lannister
guardsmen
marched
past,
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms.
Ser
Arys
was
fond
of
gossip,
but
only
when
he
was
certain
that
no
one
was
listening.

The
carpenters
had
erected
a
gallery
and
lists
in
the
outer
bailey.
It
was
a
poor
thing
indeed,
and
the
meager
throng
that
had
gathered
to
watch
filled
but
half
the
seats.
Most
of
the
spectators
were
guardsmen
in
the
gold
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch
or
the
crimson
of
House
Lannister;
of
lords
and
ladies
there
were
but
a
paltry
few,
the
handful
that
remained
at
court.
Grey-faced
Lord
Gyles
Rosby
was
coughing
into
a
square
of
pink
silk.
Lady
Tanda
was
bracketed
by
her
daughters,
placid
dull
Lollys
and
acid-tongued
Falyse.
Ebon-skinned
Jalabhar
Xho
was
an
exile
who
had
no
other
refuge,
Lady
Ermesande
a
babe
seated
on
her
wet
nurseвЂ™s
lap.
The
talk
was
she
would
soon
be
wed
to
one
of
the
queenвЂ™s
cousins,
so
the
Lannisters
might
claim
her
lands.

The
king
was
shaded
beneath
a
crimson
canopy,
one
leg
thrown
negligently
over
the
carved
wooden
arm
of
his
chair.
Princess
Myrcella
and
Prince
Tommen
sat
behind
him.
In
the
back
of
the
royal
box,
Sandor
Clegane
stood
at
guard,
his
hands
resting
on
his
swordbelt.
The
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
was
draped
over
his
broad
shoulders
and
fastened
with
a
jeweled
brooch,
the
snowy
cloth
looking
somehow
unnatural
against
his
brown
roughspun
tunic
and
studded
leather
jerkin.
вЂњLady
Sansa,вЂќ
the
Hound
announced
curtly
when
he
saw
her.
His
voice
was
as
rough
as
the
sound
of
a
saw
on
wood.
The
burn
scars
on
his
face
and
throat
made
one
side
of
his
mouth
twitch
when
he
spoke.

Princess
Myrcella
nodded
a
shy
greeting
at
the
sound
of
SansaвЂ™s
name,
but
plump
little
Prince
Tommen
jumped
up
eagerly.
вЂњSansa,
did
you
hear?
IвЂ™m
to
ride
in
the
tourney
today.
Mother
said
I
could.вЂќ
Tommen
was
all
of
eight.
He
reminded
her
of
her
own
little
brother,
Bran.
They
were
of
an
age.
Bran
was
back
at
Winterfell,
a
cripple,
yet
safe.

Sansa
would
have
given
anything
to
be
with
him.
вЂњI
fear
for
the
life
of
your
foeman,вЂќ
she
told
Tommen
solemnly.

вЂњHis
foeman
will
be
stuffed
with
straw,вЂќ
Joff
said
as
he
rose.
The
king
was
clad
in
a
gilded
breastplate
with
a
roaring
lion
engraved
upon
its
chest,
as
if
he
expected
the
war
to
engulf
them
at
any
moment.
He
was
thirteen
today,
and
tall
for
his
age,
with
the
green
eyes
and
golden
hair
of
the
Lannisters.

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
she
said,
dipping
in
a
curtsy.

Ser
Arys
bowed.
вЂњPray
pardon
me,
Your
Grace.
I
must
equip
myself
for
the
lists.вЂќ

Joffrey
waved
a
curt
dismissal
while
he
studied
Sansa
from
head
to
heels.
вЂњIвЂ™m
pleased
you
wore
my
stones.вЂќ

So
the
king
had
decided
to
play
the
gallant
today.
Sansa
was
relieved.
вЂњI
thank
you
for
themвЂ¦
and
for
your
tender
words.
I
pray
you
a
lucky
name
day,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњSit,вЂќ
Joff
commanded,
gesturing
her
to
the
empty
seat
beside
his
own.
вЂњHave
you
heard?
The
Beggar
King
is
dead.вЂќ

вЂњWho?вЂќ
For
a
moment
Sansa
was
afraid
he
meant
Robb.

вЂњViserys.
The
last
son
of
Mad
King
Aerys.
HeвЂ™s
been
going
about
the
Free
Cities
since
before
I
was
born,
calling
himself
a
king.
Well,
Mother
says
the
Dothraki
finally
crowned
him.
With
molten
gold.вЂќ
He
laughed.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
funny,
donвЂ™t
you
think?
The
dragon
was
their
sigil.
ItвЂ™s
almost
as
good
as
if
some
wolf
killed
your
traitor
brother.
Maybe
IвЂ™ll
feed
him
to
wolves
after
IвЂ™ve
caught
him.
Did
I
tell
you,
I
intend
to
challenge
him
to
single
combat?вЂќ

вЂњI
should
like
to
see
that,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
More
than
you
know.
Sansa
kept
her
tone
cool
and
polite,
yet
even
so
JoffreyвЂ™s
eyes
narrowed
as
he
tried
to
decide
whether
she
was
mocking
him.
вЂњWill
you
enter
the
lists
today?вЂќ
she
asked
quickly.

The
king
frowned.
вЂњMy
lady
mother
said
it
was
not
fitting,
since
the
tourney
is
in
my
honor.
Otherwise
I
would
have
been
champion.
IsnвЂ™t
that
so,
dog?вЂќ

The
HoundвЂ™s
mouth
twitched.
вЂњAgainst
this
lot?
Why
not?вЂќ

He
had
been
the
champion
in
her
fatherвЂ™s
tourney,
Sansa
remembered.
вЂњWill
you
joust
today,
my
lord?вЂќ
she
asked
him.

CleganeвЂ™s
voice
was
thick
with
contempt.
вЂњWouldnвЂ™t
be
worth
the
bother
of
arming
myself.
This
is
a
tournament
of
gnats.вЂќ

The
king
laughed.
вЂњMy
dog
has
a
fierce
bark.
Perhaps
I
should
command
him
to
fight
the
dayвЂ™s
champion.
To
the
death.вЂќ
Joffrey
was
fond
of
making
men
fight
to
the
death.

вЂњYouвЂ™d
be
one
knight
the
poorer.вЂќ
The
Hound
had
never
taken
a
knightвЂ™s
vows.
His
brother
was
a
knight,
and
he
hated
his
brother.

A
blare
of
trumpets
sounded.
The
king
settled
back
in
his
seat
and
took
SansaвЂ™s
hand.
Once
that
would
have
set
her
heart
to
pounding,
but
that
was
before
he
had
answered
her
plea
for
mercy
by
presenting
her
with
her
fatherвЂ™s
head.
His
touch
filled
her
with
revulsion
now,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
show
it.
She
made
herself
sit
very
still.

вЂњSer
Meryn
Trant
of
the
Kingsguard,вЂќ
a
herald
called.

Ser
Meryn
entered
from
the
west
side
of
the
yard,
clad
in
gleaming
white
plate
chased
with
gold
and
mounted
on
a
milk-white
charger
with
a
flowing
grey
mane.
His
cloak
streamed
behind
him
like
a
field
of
snow.
He
carried
a
twelve-foot
lance.

вЂњSer
Hobber
of
House
Redwyne,
of
the
Arbor,вЂќ
the
herald
sang.
Ser
Hobber
trotted
in
from
the
east,
riding
a
black
stallion
caparisoned
in
burgundy
and
blue.
His
lance
was
striped
in
the
same
colors,
and
his
shield
bore
the
grape
cluster
sigil
of
his
House.
The
Redwyne
twins
were
the
queenвЂ™s
unwilling
guests,
even
as
Sansa
was.
She
wondered
whose
notion
it
had
been
for
them
to
ride
in
JoffreyвЂ™s
tourney.
Not
their
own,
she
thought.

At
a
signal
from
the
master
of
revels,
the
combatants
couched
their
lances
and
put
their
spurs
to
their
mounts.
There
were
shouts
from
the
watching
guardsmen
and
the
lords
and
ladies
in
the
gallery.
The
knights
came
together
in
the
center
of
the
yard
with
a
great
shock
of
wood
and
steel.
The
white
lance
and
the
striped
one
exploded
in
splinters
within
a
second
of
each
other.
Hobber
Redwyne
reeled
at
the
impact,
yet
somehow
managed
to
keep
his
seat.
Wheeling
their
horses
about
at
the
far
end
of
the
lists,
the
knights
tossed
down
their
broken
lances
and
accepted
replacements
from
the
squires.
Ser
Horas
Redwyne,
Ser
HobberвЂ™s
twin,
shouted
encouragement
to
his
brother.

But
on
their
second
pass
Ser
Meryn
swung
the
point
of
his
lance
to
strike
Ser
Hobber
in
the
chest,
driving
him
from
the
saddle
to
crash
resoundingly
to
the
earth.
Ser
Horas
cursed
and
ran
out
to
help
his
battered
brother
from
the
field.

вЂњPoorly
ridden,вЂќ
declared
King
Joffrey.

вЂњSer
Balon
Swann,
of
Stonehelm
in
the
Red
Watch,вЂќ
came
the
heraldвЂ™s
cry.
Wide
white
wings
ornamented
Ser
BalonвЂ™s
greathelm,
and
black
and
white
swans
fought
on
his
shield.
вЂњMorros
of
House
Slynt,
heir
to
Lord
Janos
of
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњLook
at
that
upjumped
oaf,вЂќ
Joff
hooted,
loud
enough
for
half
the
yard
to
hear.
Morros,
a
mere
squire
and
a
new-made
squire
at
that,
was
having
difficulty
managing
lance
and
shield.
The
lance
was
a
knightвЂ™s
weapon,
Sansa
knew,
the
Slynts
lowborn.
Lord
Janos
had
been
no
more
than
commander
of
the
City
Watch
before
Joffrey
had
raised
him
to
Harrenhal
and
the
council.

I
hope
he
falls
and
shames
himself,
she
thought
bitterly.
I
hope
Ser
Balon
kills
him.
When
Joffrey
proclaimed
her
fatherвЂ™s
death,
it
had
been
Janos
Slynt
who
seized
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
severed
head
by
the
hair
and
raised
it
on
high
for
king
and
crowd
to
behold,
while
Sansa
wept
and
screamed.

Morros
wore
a
checkered
black-and-gold
cloak
over
black
armor
inlaid
with
golden
scrollwork.
On
his
shield
was
the
bloody
spear
his
father
had
chosen
as
the
sigil
of
their
new-made
house.
But
he
did
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
the
shield
as
he
urged
his
horse
forward,
and
Ser
BalonвЂ™s
point
struck
the
blazon
square.
Morros
dropped
his
lance,
fought
for
balance,
and
lost.
One
foot
caught
in
a
stirrup
as
he
fell,
and
the
runaway
charger
dragged
the
youth
to
the
end
of
the
lists,
head
bouncing
against
the
ground.
Joff
hooted
derision.
Sansa
was
appalled,
wondering
if
the
gods
had
heard
her
vengeful
prayer.
But
when
they
disentangled
Morros
Slynt
from
his
horse,
they
found
him
bloodied
but
alive.
вЂњTommen,
we
picked
the
wrong
foe
for
you,вЂќ
the
king
told
his
brother.
вЂњThe
straw
knight
jousts
better
than
that
one.вЂќ

Next
came
Ser
Horas
RedwyneвЂ™s
turn.
He
fared
better
than
his
twin,
vanquishing
an
elderly
knight
whose
mount
was
bedecked
with
silver
griffins
against
a
striped
blue-and-white
field.
Splendid
as
he
looked,
the
old
man
made
a
poor
contest
of
it.
Joffrey
curled
his
lip.
вЂњThis
is
a
feeble
show.вЂќ

вЂњI
warned
you,вЂќ
said
the
Hound.
вЂњGnats.вЂќ

The
king
was
growing
bored.
It
made
Sansa
anxious.
She
lowered
her
eyes
and
resolved
to
keep
quiet,
no
matter
what.
When
Joffrey
BaratheonвЂ™s
mood
darkened,
any
chance
word
might
set
off
one
of
his
rages.

вЂњLothor
Brune,
freerider
in
the
service
of
Lord
Baelish,вЂќ
cried
the
herald.
вЂњSer
Dontos
the
Red,
of
House
Hollard.
вЂњ

The
freerider,
a
small
man
in
dented
plate
without
device,
duly
appeared
at
the
west
end
of
the
yard,
but
of
his
opponent
there
was
no
sign.
Finally
a
chestnut
stallion
trotted
into
view
in
a
swirl
of
crimson
and
scarlet
silks,
but
Ser
Dontos
was
not
on
it.
The
knight
appeared
a
moment
later,
cursing
and
staggering,
clad
in
breastplate
and
plumed
helm
and
nothing
else.
His
legs
were
pale
and
skinny,
and
his
manhood
flopped
about
obscenely
as
he
chased
after
his
horse.
The
watchers
roared
and
shouted
insults.
Catching
his
horse
by
the
bridle,
Ser
Dontos
tried
to
mount,
but
the
animal
would
not
stand
still
and
the
knight
was
so
drunk
that
his
bare
foot
kept
missing
the
stirrup.

By
then
the
crowd
was
howling
with
laughterвЂ¦
all
but
the
king.
Joffrey
had
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
Sansa
remembered
well,
the
same
look
heвЂ™d
had
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
the
day
he
pronounced
death
on
Lord
Eddard
Stark.
Finally
Ser
Dontos
the
Red
gave
it
up
for
a
bad
job,
sat
down
in
the
dirt,
and
removed
his
plumed
helm.
вЂњI
lose,вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњFetch
me
some
wine.вЂќ

The
king
stood.
вЂњA
cask
from
the
cellars!
IвЂ™ll
see
him
drowned
in
it.вЂќ

Sansa
heard
herself
gasp.
вЂњNo,
you
canвЂ™t.вЂќ

Joffrey
turned
his
head.
вЂњWhat
did
you
say?вЂќ

Sansa
could
not
believe
she
had
spoken.
Was
she
mad?
To
tell
him
no
in
front
of
half
the
court?
She
hadnвЂ™t
meant
to
say
anything,
onlyвЂ¦
Ser
Dontos
was
drunk
and
silly
and
useless,
but
he
meant
no
harm.

вЂњDid
you
say
I
canвЂ™t?
Did
you?вЂќ

вЂњPlease,вЂќ
Sansa
said,
вЂњI
only
meantвЂ¦
it
would
be
ill
luck,
Your
GraceвЂ¦
to,
to
kill
a
man
on
your
name
day.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
lying,вЂќ
Joffrey
said.
вЂњI
ought
to
drown
you
with
him,
if
you
care
for
him
so
much.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
care
for
him,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
The
words
tumbled
out
desperately.
вЂњDrown
him
or
have
his
head
off,
onlyвЂ¦
kill
him
on
the
morrow,
if
you
like,
but
pleaseвЂ¦
not
today,
not
on
your
name
day.
I
couldnвЂ™t
bear
for
you
to
have
ill
luckвЂ¦
terrible
luck,
even
for
kings,
the
singers
all
say
soвЂ¦вЂќ

Joffrey
scowled.
He
knew
she
was
lying,
she
could
see
it.
He
would
make
her
bleed
for
this.

вЂњThe
girl
speaks
truly,вЂќ
the
Hound
rasped.
вЂњWhat
a
man
sows
on
his
name
day,
he
reaps
throughout
the
year.вЂќ
His
voice
was
flat,
as
if
he
did
not
care
a
whit
whether
the
king
believed
him
or
no.
Could
it
be
true?
Sansa
had
not
known.
It
was
just
something
sheвЂ™d
said,
desperate
to
avoid
punishment.

Unhappy,
Joffrey
shifted
in
his
seat
and
flicked
his
fingers
at
Ser
Dontos.
вЂњTake
him
away.
IвЂ™ll
have
him
killed
on
the
morrow,
the
fool.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is,вЂќ
Sansa
said.
вЂњA
fool.
YouвЂ™re
so
clever,
to
see
it.
HeвЂ™s
better
fitted
to
be
a
fool
than
a
knight,
isnвЂ™t
he?
You
ought
to
dress
him
in
motley
and
make
him
clown
for
you.
He
doesnвЂ™t
deserve
the
mercy
of
a
quick
death.вЂќ

The
king
studied
her
a
moment.
вЂњPerhaps
youвЂ™re
not
so
stupid
as
Mother
says.вЂќ
He
raised
his
voice.
вЂњDid
you
hear
my
lady,
Dontos?
From
this
day
on,
youвЂ™re
my
new
fool.
You
can
sleep
with
Moon
Boy
and
dress
in
motley.вЂќ

Ser
Dontos,
sobered
by
his
near
brush
with
death,
crawled
to
his
knees.
вЂњThank
you,
Your
Grace.
And
you,
my
lady.
Thank
you.вЂќ

As
a
brace
of
Lannister
guardsmen
led
him
off,
the
master
of
revels
approached
the
box.
вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњshall
I
summon
a
new
challenger
for
Brune,
or
proceed
with
the
next
tilt?вЂќ

вЂњNeither.
These
are
gnats,
not
knights.
IвЂ™d
have
them
all
put
to
death,
only
itвЂ™s
my
name
day.
The
tourney
is
done.
Get
them
all
out
of
my
sight.вЂќ

The
master
of
revels
bowed,
but
Prince
Tommen
was
not
so
obedient.
вЂњIвЂ™m
supposed
to
ride
against
the
straw
man.вЂќ

вЂњNot
today.вЂќ

вЂњBut
I
want
to
ride!вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
care
what
you
want.вЂќ

вЂњMother
said
I
could
ride.вЂќ

вЂњShe
said,вЂќ
Princess
Myrcella
agreed.

вЂњMother
said,вЂќ
mocked
the
king.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
be
childish.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™re
children,вЂќ
Myrcella
declared
haughtily.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
supposed
to
be
childish.вЂќ

The
Hound
laughed.
вЂњShe
has
you
there.вЂќ

Joffrey
was
beaten.
вЂњVery
well.
Even
my
brother
couldnвЂ™t
tilt
any
worse
than
these
others.
Master,
bring
out
the
quintain,
Tommen
wants
to
be
a
gnat.вЂќ

Tommen
gave
a
shout
of
joy
and
ran
off
to
be
readied,
his
chubby
little
legs
pumping
hard.
вЂњLuck,вЂќ
Sansa
called
to
him.

They
set
up
the
quintain
at
the
far
end
of
the
lists
while
the
princeвЂ™s
pony
was
being
saddled.
TommenвЂ™s
opponent
was
a
child-sized
leather
warrior
stuffed
with
straw
and
mounted
on
a
pivot,
with
a
shield
in
one
hand
and
a
padded
mace
in
the
other.
Someone
had
fastened
a
pair
of
antlers
to
the
knightвЂ™s
head.
JoffreyвЂ™s
father
King
Robert
had
worn
antlers
on
his
helm,
Sansa
rememberedвЂ¦
but
so
did
his
uncle
Lord
Renly,
RobertвЂ™s
brother,
who
had
turned
traitor
and
crowned
himself
king.

A
pair
of
squires
buckled
the
prince
into
his
ornate
silver-and-crimson
armor.
A
tall
plume
of
red
feathers
sprouted
from
the
crest
of
his
helm,
and
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
frolicked
together
on
his
shield.
The
squires
helped
him
mount,
and
Ser
Aron
Santagar,
the
Red
KeepвЂ™s
master-at-arms,
stepped
forward
and
handed
Tommen
a
blunted
silver
longsword
with
a
leaf-shaped
blade,
crafted
to
fit
an
eight-year-old
hand.

Tommen
raised
the
blade
high.
вЂњCasterly
Rock!вЂќ
he
shouted
in
a
high
boyish
voice
as
he
put
his
heels
into
his
pony
and
started
across
the
hard-packed
dirt
at
the
quintain.
Lady
Tanda
and
Lord
Gyles
started
a
ragged
cheer,
and
Sansa
added
her
voice
to
theirs.
The
king
brooded
in
silence.

Tommen
got
his
pony
up
to
a
brisk
trot,
waved
his
sword
vigorously,
and
struck
the
knightвЂ™s
shield
a
solid
blow
as
he
went
by.
The
quintain
spun,
the
padded
mace
flying
around
to
give
the
prince
a
mighty
whack
in
the
back
of
his
head.
Tommen
spilled
from
the
saddle,
his
new
armor
rattling
like
a
bag
of
old
pots
as
he
hit
the
ground.
His
sword
went
flying,
his
pony
cantered
away
across
the
bailey,
and
a
great
gale
of
derision
went
up.
King
Joffrey
laughed
longest
and
loudest
of
all.

вЂњOh,вЂќ
Princess
Myrcella
cried.
She
scrambled
out
of
the
box
and
ran
to
her
little
brother.

Sansa
found
herself
possessed
of
a
queer
giddy
courage.
вЂњYou
should
go
with
her,вЂќ
she
told
the
king.
вЂњYour
brother
might
be
hurt.вЂќ

Joffrey
shrugged.
вЂњWhat
if
he
is?вЂќ

вЂњYou
should
help
him
up
and
tell
him
how
well
he
rode.вЂќ
Sansa
could
not
seem
to
stop
herself.

вЂњHe
got
knocked
off
his
horse
and
fell
in
the
dirt,вЂќ
the
king
pointed
out.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
not
riding
well.вЂќ

вЂњLook,вЂќ
the
Hound
interrupted.
вЂњThe
boy
has
courage.
HeвЂ™s
going
to
try
again.вЂќ

They
were
helping
Prince
Tommen
mount
his
pony.
If
only
Tommen
were
the
elder
instead
of
Joffrey,
Sansa
thought.
I
wouldnвЂ™t
mind
marrying
Tommen.

The
sounds
from
the
gatehouse
took
them
by
surprise.
Chains
rattled
as
the
portcullis
was
drawn
upward,
and
the
great
gates
opened
to
the
creak
of
iron
hinges.
вЂњWho
told
them
to
open
the
gate?вЂќ
Joff
demanded.
With
the
troubles
in
the
city,
the
gates
of
the
Red
Keep
had
been
closed
for
days.

A
column
of
riders
emerged
from
beneath
the
portcullis
with
a
clink
of
steel
and
a
clatter
of
hooves.
Clegane
stepped
close
to
the
king,
one
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
longsword.
The
visitors
were
dinted
and
haggard
and
dusty,
yet
the
standard
they
carried
was
the
lion
of
Lannister,
golden
on
its
crimson
field.
A
few
wore
the
red
cloaks
and
mail
of
Lannister
men-at-arms,
but
more
were
freeriders
and
sellswords,
armored
in
oddments
and
bristling
with
sharp
steelвЂ¦
and
there
were
others,
monstrous
savages
out
of
one
of
Old
NanвЂ™s
tales,
the
scary
ones
Bran
used
to
love.
They
were
clad
in
shabby
skins
and
boiled
leather,
with
long
hair
and
fierce
beards.
Some
wore
bloodstained
bandages
over
their
brows
or
wrapped
around
their
hands,
and
others
were
missing
eyes,
ears,
and
fingers.

In
their
midst,
riding
on
a
tall
red
horse
in
a
strange
high
saddle
that
cradled
him
back
and
front,
was
the
queenвЂ™s
dwarf
brother
Tyrion
Lannister,
the
one
they
called
the
Imp.
He
had
let
his
beard
grow
to
cover
his
pushed-in
face,
until
it
was
a
bristly
tangle
of
yellow
and
black
hair,
coarse
as
wire.
Down
his
back
flowed
a
shadowskin
cloak,
black
fur
striped
with
white.
He
held
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
carried
his
right
arm
in
a
white
silk
sling,
but
otherwise
looked
as
grotesque
as
Sansa
remembered
from
when
he
had
visited
Winterfell.
With
his
bulging
brow
and
mismatched
eyes,
he
was
still
the
ugliest
man
she
had
ever
chanced
to
look
upon.

Yet
Tommen
put
his
spurs
into
his
pony
and
galloped
headlong
across
the
yard,
shouting
with
glee.
One
of
the
savages,
a
huge
shambling
man
so
hairy
that
his
face
was
all
but
lost
beneath
his
whiskers,
scooped
the
boy
out
of
his
saddle,
armor
and
all,
and
deposited
him
on
the
ground
beside
his
uncle.
TommenвЂ™s
breathless
laughter
echoed
off
the
walls
as
Tyrion
clapped
him
on
the
backplate,
and
Sansa
was
startled
to
see
that
the
two
were
of
a
height.
Myrcella
came
running
after
her
brother,
and
the
dwarf
picked
her
up
by
the
waist
and
spun
her
in
a
circle,
squealing.

When
he
lowered
her
back
to
the
ground,
the
little
man
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
brow
and
came
waddling
across
the
yard
toward
Joffrey.
Two
of
his
men
followed
close
behind
him;
a
black-haired
black-eyed
sellsword
who
moved
like
a
stalking
cat,
and
a
gaunt
youth
with
an
empty
socket
where
one
eye
should
have
been.
Tommen
and
Myrcella
trailed
after
them.

The
dwarf
went
to
one
knee
before
the
king.
вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњYou,вЂќ
Joffrey
said.

вЂњMe,вЂќ
the
Imp
agreed,
вЂњalthough
a
more
courteous
greeting
might
be
in
order,
for
an
uncle
and
an
elder.вЂќ

вЂњThey
said
you
were
dead,вЂќ
the
Hound
said.

The
little
man
gave
the
big
one
a
look.
One
of
his
eyes
was
green,
one
was
black,
and
both
were
cool.
вЂњI
was
speaking
to
the
king,
not
to
his
cur.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
glad
youвЂ™re
not
dead,вЂќ
said
Princess
Myrcella.

вЂњWe
share
that
view,
sweet
child.вЂќ
Tyrion
turned
to
Sansa.
вЂњMy
lady,
I
am
sorry
for
your
losses.
Truly,
the
gods
are
cruel.вЂќ

Sansa
could
not
think
of
a
word
to
say
to
him.
How
could
he
be
sorry
for
her
losses?
Was
he
mocking
her?
It
wasnвЂ™t
the
gods
whoвЂ™d
been
cruel,
it
was
Joffrey.

вЂњI
am
sorry
for
your
loss
as
well,
Joffrey,вЂќ
the
dwarf
said.

вЂњWhat
loss?вЂќ

вЂњYour
royal
father?
A
large
fierce
man
with
a
black
beard;
youвЂ™ll
recall
him
if
you
try.
He
was
king
before
you.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
him.
Yes,
it
was
very
sad,
a
boar
killed
him.вЂќ

вЂњIs
that
what
вЂtheyвЂ™
say,
Your
Grace?вЂќ

Joffrey
frowned.
Sansa
felt
that
she
ought
to
say
something.
What
was
it
that
Septa
Mordane
used
to
tell
her?
A
ladyвЂ™s
armor
is
courtesy,
that
was
it.
She
donned
her
armor
and
said,
вЂњIвЂ™m
sorry
my
lady
mother
took
you
captive,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњA
great
many
people
are
sorry
for
that,вЂќ
Tyrion
replied,
вЂњand
before
I
am
done,
some
may
be
a
deal
sorrierвЂ¦
yet
I
thank
you
for
the
sentiment.
Joffrey,
where
might
I
find
your
mother?вЂќ

вЂњSheвЂ™s
with
my
council,вЂќ
the
king
answered.
вЂњYour
brother
Jaime
keeps
losing
battles.вЂќ
He
gave
Sansa
an
angry
look,
as
if
it
were
her
fault.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
been
taken
by
the
Starks
and
weвЂ™ve
lost
Riverrun
and
now
her
stupid
brother
is
calling
himself
a
king.вЂќ

The
dwarf
smiled
crookedly.
вЂњAll
sorts
of
people
are
calling
themselves
kings
these
days.вЂќ

Joff
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
that,
though
he
looked
suspicious
and
out
of
sorts.
вЂњYes.
Well.
I
am
pleased
youвЂ™re
not
dead,
Uncle.
Did
you
bring
me
a
gift
for
my
name
day?вЂќ

вЂњI
did.
My
wits.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
have
Robb
StarkвЂ™s
head,вЂќ
Joff
said
with
a
sly
glance
at
Sansa.
вЂњTommen,
Myrcella,
come.вЂќ

Sandor
Clegane
lingered
behind
a
moment.
вЂњIвЂ™d
guard
that
tongue
of
yours,
little
man,вЂќ
he
warned,
before
he
strode
off
after
his
liege.

Sansa
was
left
with
the
dwarf
and
his
monsters.
She
tried
to
think
of
what
else
she
might
say.
вЂњYou
hurt
your
arm,вЂќ
she
managed
at
last.

вЂњOne
of
your
northmen
hit
me
with
a
morningstar
during
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork.
I
escaped
him
by
falling
off
my
horse.вЂќ
His
grin
turned
into
something
softer
as
he
studied
her
face.
вЂњIs
it
grief
for
your
lord
father
that
makes
you
so
sad?вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
was
a
traitor,вЂќ
Sansa
said
at
once.
вЂњAnd
my
brother
and
lady
mother
are
traitors
as
well.вЂќ
That
reflex
she
had
learned
quickly.
вЂњI
am
loyal
to
my
beloved
Joffrey.вЂќ

вЂњNo
doubt.
As
loyal
as
a
deer
surrounded
by
wolves.вЂќ

вЂњLions,вЂќ
she
whispered,
without
thinking.
She
glanced
about
nervously,
but
there
was
no
one
close
enough
to
hear.

Lannister
reached
out
and
took
her
hand,
and
gave
it
a
squeeze.
вЂњI
am
only
a
little
lion,
child,
and
I
vow,
I
shall
not
savage
you.вЂќ
Bowing,
he
said
вЂњBut
now
you
must
excuse
me.
I
have
urgent
business
with
queen
and
council.вЂќ

Sansa
watched
him
walk
off,
his
body
swaying
heavily
from
side
to
side
with
every
step,
like
something
from
a
grotesquerie.
He
speaks
more
gently
than
Joffrey,
she
thought,
but
the
queen
spoke
to
me
gently
too.
HeвЂ™s
still
a
Lannister,
her
brother
and
JoffвЂ™s
uncle,
and
no
friend.
Once
she
had
loved
Prince
Joffrey
with
all
her
heart,
and
admired
and
trusted
his
mother,
the
queen.
They
had
repaid
that
love
and
trust
with
her
fatherвЂ™s
head.
Sansa
would
never
make
that
mistake
again.





TYRION

In
the
chilly
white
raiment
of
the
Kingsguard,
Ser
Mandon
Moore
looked
like
a
corpse
in
a
shroud.
вЂњHer
Grace
left
orders,
the
council
in
session
is
not
to
be
disturbed.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
be
only
a
small
disturbance,
ser.вЂќ
Tyrion
slid
the
parchment
from
his
sleeve.
вЂњI
bear
a
letter
from
my
father,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
the
Hand
of
the
King.
There
is
his
seal.вЂќ

вЂњHer
Grace
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed,вЂќ
Ser
Mandon
repeated
slowly,
as
if
Tyrion
were
a
dullard
who
had
not
heard
him
the
first
time.

Jaime
had
once
told
him
that
Moore
was
the
most
dangerous
of
the
KingsguardвЂ”excepting
himself,
alwaysвЂ”because
his
face
gave
no
hint
as
what
he
might
do
next.
Tyrion
would
have
welcomed
a
hint.
Bronn
and
Timett
could
likely
kill
the
knight
if
it
came
to
swords,
but
it
would
scarcely
bode
well
if
he
began
by
slaying
one
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
protectors.
Yet
if
he
let
the
man
turn
him
away,
where
was
his
authority?
He
made
himself
smile.
вЂњSer
Mandon,
you
have
not
met
my
companions.
This
is
Timett
son
of
Timett,
a
red
hand
of
the
Burned
Men.
And
this
is
Bronn.
Perchance
you
recall
Ser
Vardis
Egen,
who
was
captain
of
Lord
ArrynвЂ™s
household
guard?вЂќ

вЂњI
know
the
man.вЂќ
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
eyes
were
pale
grey,
oddly
flat
and
lifeless.

вЂњKnew,вЂќ
Bronn
corrected
with
a
thin
smile.

Ser
Mandon
did
not
deign
to
show
that
he
had
heard
that.

вЂњBe
that
as
it
may,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
lightly,
вЂњI
truly
must
see
my
sister
and
present
my
letter,
ser.
If
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
open
the
door
for
us?вЂќ

The
white
knight
did
not
respond.
Tyrion
was
almost
at
the
point
of
trying
to
force
his
way
past
when
Ser
Mandon
abruptly
stood
aside.
вЂњYou
may
enter.
They
may
not.вЂќ

A
small
victory,
he
thought,
but
sweet.
He
had
passed
his
first
test.
Tyrion
Lannister
shouldered
through
the
door,
feeling
almost
tall.
Five
members
of
the
kingвЂ™s
small
council
broke
off
their
discussion
suddenly.
вЂњYou,вЂќ
his
sister
Cersei
said
in
a
tone
that
was
equal
parts
disbelief
and
distaste.

вЂњI
can
see
where
Joffrey
learned
his
courtesies.вЂќ
Tyrion
paused
to
admire
the
pair
of
Valyrian
sphinxes
that
guarded
the
door,
affecting
an
air
of
casual
confidence.
Cersei
could
smell
weakness
the
way
a
dog
smells
fear.

вЂњWhat
are
you
doing
here?вЂќ
His
sisterвЂ™s
lovely
green
eyes
studied
him
without
the
least
hint
of
affection.

вЂњDelivering
a
letter
from
our
lord
father.вЂќ
He
sauntered
to
the
table
and
placed
the
tightly
rolled
parchment
between
them.

The
eunuch
Varys
took
the
letter
and
turned
it
in
his
delicate
powdered
hands.
вЂњHow
kind
of
Lord
Tywin.
And
his
scaling
wax
is
such
a
lovely
shade
of
gold.вЂќ
Varys
gave
the
seal
a
close
inspection.
вЂњIt
gives
every
appearance
of
being
genuine.вЂќ

вЂњOf
course
itвЂ™s
genuine.вЂќ
Cersei
snatched
it
out
of
his
hands.
She
broke
the
wax
and
unrolled
the
parchment.

Tyrion
watched
her
read.
His
sister
had
taken
the
kingвЂ™s
seat
for
herselfвЂ”he
gathered
Joffrey
did
not
often
trouble
to
attend
council
meetings,
no
more
than
Robert
hadвЂ”so
Tyrion
climbed
up
into
the
HandвЂ™s
chair.
it
seemed
only
appropriate.

вЂњThis
is
absurd,вЂќ
the
queen
said
at
last.
вЂњMy
lord
father
has
sent
my
brother
to
sit
in
his
place
in
this
council.
He
bids
us
accept
Tyrion
as
the
Hand
of
the
King,
until
such
time
as
he
himself
can
join
us.вЂќ

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stroked
his
flowing
white
beard
and
nodded
ponderously.
вЂњIt
would
seem
that
a
welcome
is
in
order.вЂќ

вЂњIndeed.вЂќ
Jowly,
balding
Janos
Slynt
looked
rather
like
a
frog,
a
smug
frog
who
had
gotten
rather
above
himself.
вЂњWe
have
sore
need
of
you,
my
lord.
Rebellion
everywhere,
this
grim
omen
in
the
sky,
rioting
in
the
city
streetsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAnd
whose
fault
is
that,
Lord
Janos?вЂќ
Cersei
lashed
out.
вЂњYour
gold
cloaks
are
charged
with
keeping
order.
As
to
you,
Tyrion,
you
could
better
serve
us
on
the
field
of
battle.вЂќ

He
laughed.
вЂњNo,
IвЂ™m
done
with
fields
of
battle,
thank
you.
I
sit
a
chair
better
than
a
horse,
and
IвЂ™d
sooner
hold
a
wine
goblet
than
a
battle-axe.
All
that
about
the
thunder
of
the
drums,
sunlight
flashing
on
armor,
magnificent
destriers
snorting
and
prancing?
Well,
the
drums
gave
me
headaches,
the
sunlight
flashing
on
my
armor
cooked
me
up
like
a
harvest
day
goose,
and
those
magnificent
destriers
shit
everywhere.
Not
that
I
am
complaining.
Compared
to
the
hospitality
I
enjoyed
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
drums,
horseshit,
and
fly
bites
are
my
favorite
things.вЂќ

Littlefinger
laughed.
вЂњWell
said,
Lannister.
A
man
after
my
own
heart.вЂќ

Tyrion
smiled
at
him,
remembering
a
certain
dagger
with
a
dragonbone
hilt
and
a
Valyrian
steel
blade.
We
must
have
a
talk
about
that,
and
soon.
He
wondered
if
Lord
Petyr
would
find
that
subject
amusing
as
well.
вЂњPlease,вЂќ
he
told
them,
вЂњdo
let
me
be
of
service,
in
whatever
small
way
I
can.вЂќ

Cersei
read
the
letter
again.
вЂњHow
many
men
have
you
brought
with
you?
вЂњ

вЂњA
few
hundred.
My
own
men,
chiefly.
Father
was
loath
to
part
with
any
of
his.
He
is
fighting
a
war,
after
all.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
use
will
your
few
hundred
men
be
if
Renly
marches
on
the
city,
or
Stannis
sails
from
Dragonstone?
I
ask
for
an
army
and
my
father
sends
me
a
dwarf.
The
king
names
the
Hand,
with
the
consent
of
council.
Joffrey
named
our
lord
father.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
our
lord
father
named
me.вЂќ

вЂњHe
cannot
do
that.
Not
without
JoffвЂ™s
consent.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Tywin
is
at
Harrenhal
with
his
host,
if
youвЂ™d
care
to
take
it
up
with
him,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
politely.
вЂњMy
lords,
perchance
you
would
permit
me
a
private
word
with
my
sister?вЂќ

Varys
slithered
to
his
feet,
smiling
in
that
unctuous
way
he
had.
вЂњHow
you
must
have
yearned
for
the
sound
of
your
sweet
sisterвЂ™s
voice.
My
lords,
please,
let
us
give
them
a
few
moments
together.
The
woes
of
our
troubled
realm
shall
keep.вЂќ

Janos
Slynt
rose
hesitantly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
ponderously,
yet
they
rose.
Littlefinger
was
the
last.
вЂњShall
I
tell
the
steward
to
prepare
chambers
in
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast?вЂќ

вЂњMy
thanks,
Lord
Petyr,
but
I
will
be
taking
Lord
StarkвЂ™s
former
quarters
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.вЂќ

Littlefinger
laughed.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
a
braver
man
than
me,
Lannister.
You
do
know
the
fate
of
our
last
two
Hands?вЂќ

вЂњTwo?
If
you
mean
to
frighten
me,
why
not
say
four?вЂќ

вЂњFour?вЂќ
Littlefinger
raised
an
eyebrow.
вЂњDid
the
Hands
before
Lord
Arryn
meet
some
dire
end
in
the
Tower?
IвЂ™m
afraid
I
was
too
young
to
pay
them
much
mind.вЂќ

вЂњAerys
TargaryenвЂ™s
last
Hand
was
killed
during
the
Sack
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
though
I
doubt
heвЂ™d
had
time
to
settle
into
the
Tower.
He
was
only
Hand
for
a
fortnight.
The
one
before
him
was
burned
to
death.
And
before
them
came
two
others
who
died
landless
and
penniless
in
exile,
and
counted
themselves
lucky.
I
believe
my
lord
father
was
the
last
Hand
to
depart
KingвЂ™s
Landing
with
his
name,
properties,
and
parts
all
intact.вЂќ

вЂњFascinating,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger.
вЂњAnd
all
the
more
reason
IвЂ™d
sooner
bed
down
in
the
dungeon.вЂќ

Perhaps
youвЂ™ll
get
that
wish,
Tyrion
thought,
but
he
said,
вЂњCourage
and
folly
are
cousins,
or
so
IвЂ™ve
heard.
Whatever
curse
may
linger
over
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
I
pray
IвЂ™m
small
enough
to
escape
its
notice.вЂќ

Janos
Slynt
laughed,
Littlefinger
smiled,
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
followed
them
both
out,
bowing
gravely.

вЂњI
hope
Father
did
not
send
you
all
this
way
to
plague
us
with
history
lessons,вЂќ
his
sister
said
when
they
were
alone.

вЂњHow
I
have
yearned
for
the
sound
of
your
sweet
voice,вЂќ
Tyrion
sighed
to
her.

вЂњHow
I
have
yearned
to
have
that
eunuchвЂ™s
tongue
pulled
out
with
hot
pincers,вЂќ
Cersei
replied.
вЂњHas
father
lost
his
senses?
Or
did
you
forge
this
letter?вЂќ
She
read
it
once
more,
with
mounting
annoyance.
вЂњWhy
would
he
inflict
you
on
me?
I
wanted
him
to
come
himself.вЂќ
She
crushed
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
letter
in
her
fingers.
вЂњI
am
JoffreyвЂ™s
regent,
and
I
sent
him
a
royal
command!вЂќ

вЂњAnd
he
ignored
you,вЂќ
Tyrion
pointed
out.
вЂњHe
has
quite
a
large
army,
he
can
do
that.
Nor
is
he
the
first.
Is
he?вЂќ

CerseiвЂ™s
mouth
tightened.
He
could
see
her
color
rising.
вЂњIf
I
name
this
letter
a
forgery
and
tell
them
to
throw
you
in
a
dungeon,
no
one
will
ignore
that,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

He
was
walking
on
rotten
ice
now,
Tyrion
knew.
One
false
step
and
he
would
plunge
through.
вЂњNo
one,вЂќ
he
agreed
amiably,
вЂњleast
of
all
our
father.
The
one
with
the
army.
But
why
should
you
want
to
throw
me
into
a
dungeon,
sweet
sister,
when
IвЂ™ve
come
all
this
long
way
to
help
you?
вЂњ

вЂњI
do
not
require
your
help.
It
was
our
fatherвЂ™s
presence
that
I
commanded.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
he
said
quietly,
вЂњbut
itвЂ™s
Jaime
you
want.вЂќ

His
sister
fancied
herself
subtle,
but
he
had
grown
up
with
her.
He
could
read
her
face
like
one
of
his
favorite
books,
and
what
he
read
now
was
rage,
and
fear,
and
despair.
вЂњJaimeвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”is
my
brother
no
less
than
yours,вЂќ
Tyrion
interrupted.
вЂњGive
me
your
support
and
I
promise
you,
we
will
have
Jaime
freed
and
returned
to
us
unharmed.вЂќ

вЂњHow?вЂќ
Cersei
demanded.
вЂњThe
Stark
boy
and
his
mother
are
not
like
to
forget
that
we
beheaded
Lord
Eddard.вЂќ

вЂњTrue,вЂќ
Tyrion
agreed,
вЂњyet
you
still
hold
his
daughters,
donвЂ™t
you?
I
saw
the
older
girl
out
in
the
yard
with
Joffrey.вЂќ

вЂњSansa,вЂќ
the
queen
said.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
given
it
out
that
I
have
the
younger
brat
as
well,
but
itвЂ™s
a
lie.
I
sent
Meryn
Trant
to
take
her
in
hand
when
Robert
died,
but
her
wretched
dancing
master
interfered
and
the
girl
fled.
No
one
has
seen
her
since.
Likely
sheвЂ™s
dead.
A
great
many
people
died
that
day.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
hoped
for
both
Stark
girls,
but
he
supposed
one
would
have
to
do.
вЂњTell
me
about
our
friends
on
the
council.вЂќ

His
sister
glanced
at
the
door.
вЂњWhat
of
them?вЂќ

вЂњFather
seems
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
them.
When
I
left
him,
he
was
wondering
how
their
heads
might
look
on
the
wall
beside
Lord
StarkвЂ™s.вЂќ
He
leaned
forward
across
the
table.
вЂњAre
you
certain
of
their
loyalty?
Do
you
trust
them?вЂќ

вЂњI
trust
no
one,вЂќ
Cersei
snapped.
вЂњI
need
them.
Does
Father
believe
they
are
playing
us
false?вЂќ

вЂњSuspects,
rather.вЂќ

вЂњWhy?
What
does
he
know?вЂќ

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњHe
knows
that
your
sonвЂ™s
short
reign
has
been
a
long
parade
of
follies
and
disasters.
That
suggests
that
someone
is
giving
Joffrey
some
very
bad
counsel.вЂќ

Cersei
gave
him
a
searching
look.
вЂњJoff
has
had
no
lack
of
good
counsel.
HeвЂ™s
always
been
strong-willed.
Now
that
heвЂ™s
king,
he
believes
he
should
do
as
he
pleases,
not
as
heвЂ™s
bid.вЂќ

вЂњCrowns
do
queer
things
to
the
heads
beneath
them,вЂќ
Tyrion
agreed.
вЂњThis
business
with
Eddard
StarkвЂ¦
JoffreyвЂ™s
work?вЂќ

The
queen
grimaced.
вЂњHe
was
instructed
to
pardon
Stark,
to
allow
him
to
take
the
black.
The
man
would
have
been
out
of
our
way
forever,
and
we
might
have
made
peace
with
that
son
of
his,
but
Joff
took
it
upon
himself
to
give
the
mob
a
better
show.
What
was
I
to
do?
He
called
for
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
head
in
front
of
half
the
city.
And
Janos
Slynt
and
Ser
Ilyn
went
ahead
blithely
and
shortened
the
man
without
a
word
from
me!вЂќ
Her
hand
tightened
into
a
fist.
вЂњThe
High
Septon
claims
we
profaned
BaelorвЂ™s
Sept
with
blood,
after
lying
to
him
about
our
intent.вЂќ

вЂњIt
would
seem
he
has
a
point,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњSo
this
Lord
Slynt,
he
was
part
of
it,
was
he?
Tell
me,
whose
fine
notion
was
it
to
grant
him
Harrenhal
and
name
him
to
the
council?вЂќ

вЂњLittlefinger
made
the
arrangements.
We
needed
SlyntвЂ™s
gold
cloaks.
Eddard
Stark
was
plotting
with
Renly
and
heвЂ™d
written
to
Lord
Stannis,
offering
him
the
throne.
We
might
have
lost
all.
Even
so,
it
was
a
close
thing.
If
Sansa
hadnвЂ™t
come
to
me
and
told
me
all
her
fatherвЂ™s
plansвЂ¦вЂќ

Tyrion
was
surprised.
вЂњTruly?
His
own
daughter?вЂќ
Sansa
had
always
seemed
such
a
sweet
child,
tender
and
courteous.

вЂњThe
girl
was
wet
with
love.
She
would
have
done
anything
for
Joffrey,
until
he
cut
off
her
fatherвЂ™s
head
and
called
it
mercy.
That
put
an
end
to
that.вЂќ

вЂњHis
Grace
has
a
unique
way
of
winning
the
hearts
of
his
subjects,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
with
a
crooked
smile.
вЂњWas
it
JoffreyвЂ™s
wish
to
dismiss
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
from
his
Kingsguard
too?вЂќ

Cersei
sighed.
вЂњJoff
wanted
someone
to
blame
for
RobertвЂ™s
death.
Varys
suggested
Ser
Barristan.
Why
not?
It
gave
Jaime
command
of
the
Kingsguard
and
a
seat
on
the
small
council,
and
allowed
Joff
to
throw
a
bone
to
his
dog.
He
is
very
fond
of
Sandor
Clegane.
We
were
prepared
to
offer
Selmy
some
land
and
a
towerhouse,
more
than
the
useless
old
fool
deserved.вЂќ

вЂњI
hear
that
useless
old
fool
slew
two
of
SlyntвЂ™s
gold
cloaks
when
they
tried
to
seize
him
at
the
Mud
Gate.вЂќ

His
sister
looked
very
unhappy.
вЂњJanos
should
have
sent
more
men.
He
is
not
as
competent
as
might
be
wished.вЂќ

вЂњSer
Barristan
was
the
Lord
Commander
of
Robert
BaratheonвЂ™s
Kingsguard,вЂќ
Tyrion
reminded
her
pointedly.
вЂњHe
and
Jaime
are
the
only
survivors
of
Aerys
TargaryenвЂ™s
seven.
The
smallfolk
talk
of
him
in
the
same
way
they
talk
of
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight.
What
do
you
imagine
theyвЂ™ll
think
when
they
see
Barristan
the
Bold
riding
beside
Robb
Stark
or
Stannis
Baratheon?вЂќ

Cersei
glanced
away.
вЂњI
had
not
considered
that.вЂќ

вЂњFather
did,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњThat
is
why
he
sent
me.
To
put
an
end
to
these
follies
and
bring
your
son
to
heel.вЂќ

вЂњJoff
will
be
no
more
tractable
for
you
than
for
me.вЂќ

вЂњHe
might.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
he?вЂќ

вЂњHe
knows
you
would
never
hurt
him.вЂќ

CerseiвЂ™s
eyes
narrowed.
вЂњIf
you
believe
IвЂ™d
ever
allow
you
to
harm
my
son,
youвЂ™re
sick
with
fever.вЂќ

Tyrion
sighed.
SheвЂ™d
missed
the
point,
as
she
did
so
often.
вЂњJoffrey
is
as
safe
with
me
as
he
is
with
you,вЂќ
he
assured
her,
вЂњbut
so
long
as
the
boy
feels
threatened,
heвЂ™ll
be
more
inclined
to
listen.вЂќ
He
took
her
hand.
вЂњI
am
your
brother,
you
know.
You
need
me,
whether
you
care
to
admit
it
or
no.
Your
son
needs
me,
if
heвЂ™s
to
have
a
hope
of
retaining
that
ugly
iron
chair.вЂќ

His
sister
seemed
shocked
that
he
would
touch
her.
вЂњYou
have
always
been
cunning.вЂќ

вЂњIn
my
own
small
way.вЂќ
He
grinned.

вЂњIt
may
be
worth
the
tryingвЂ¦
but
make
no
mistake,
Tyrion.
If
I
accept
you,
you
shall
be
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand
in
name,
but
my
Hand
in
truth.
You
will
share
all
your
plans
and
intentions
with
me
before
you
act,
and
you
will
do
nothing
without
my
consent.
Do
you
understand?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
yes.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
agree?вЂќ

вЂњCertainly,вЂќ
he
lied.
вЂњI
am
yours,
sister.вЂќ
For
as
long
as
I
need
to
be.
вЂњSo,
now
that
we
are
of
one
purpose,
we
ought
have
no
more
secrets
between
us.
You
say
Joffrey
had
Lord
Eddard
killed,
Varys
dismissed
Ser
Barristan,
and
Littlefinger
gifted
us
with
Lord
Slynt.
Who
murdered
Jon
Arryn?
вЂњ

Cersei
yanked
her
hand
back.
вЂњHow
should
I
know?вЂќ

вЂњThe
grieving
widow
in
the
Eyrie
seems
to
think
it
was
me.
Where
did
she
come
by
that
notion,
I
wonder?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
sure
I
donвЂ™t
know.
That
fool
Eddard
Stark
accused
me
of
the
same
thing.
He
hinted
that
Lord
Arryn
suspected
orвЂ¦
well,
believedвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThat
you
were
fucking
our
sweet
Jaime?вЂќ

She
slapped
him.

вЂњDid
you
think
I
was
as
blind
as
Father?вЂќ
Tyrion
rubbed
his
cheek.
вЂњWho
you
lie
with
is
no
matter
to
meвЂ¦
although
it
doesnвЂ™t
seem
quite
just
that
you
should
open
your
legs
for
one
brother
and
not
the
other.вЂќ

She
slapped
him.

вЂњBe
gentle,
Cersei,
IвЂ™m
only
jesting
with
you.
If
truth
be
told,
IвЂ™d
sooner
have
a
nice
whore.
I
never
understood
what
Jaime
saw
in
you,
apart
from
his
own
reflection.вЂќ

She
slapped
him.

His
cheeks
were
red
and
burning,
yet
he
smiled.
вЂњIf
you
keep
doing
that,
I
may
get
angry.вЂќ

That
stayed
her
hand.
вЂњWhy
should
I
care
if
you
do?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
some
new
friends,вЂќ
Tyrion
confessed.
вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
like
them
at
all.
How
did
you
kill
Robert?вЂќ

вЂњHe
did
that
himself.
All
we
did
was
help.
When
Lancel
saw
that
Robert
was
going
after
boar,
he
gave
him
strongwine.
His
favorite
sour
red,
but
fortified,
three
times
as
potent
as
he
was
used
to.
The
great
stinking
fool
loved
it.
He
could
have
stopped
swilling
it
down
anytime
he
cared
to,
but
no,
he
drained
one
skin
and
told
Lancel
to
fetch
another.
The
boar
did
the
rest.
You
should
have
been
at
the
feast,
Tyrion.
There
has
never
been
a
boar
so
delicious.
They
cooked
it
with
mushrooms
and
apples,
and
it
tasted
like
triumph.вЂќ

вЂњTruly,
sister,
you
were
born
to
be
a
widow.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
rather
liked
Robert
Baratheon,
great
blustering
oaf
that
he
wasвЂ¦
doubtless
in
part
because
his
sister
loathed
him
so.
вЂњNow,
if
you
are
done
slapping
me,
I
will
be
off.вЂќ
He
twisted
his
legs
around
and
clambered
down
awkwardly
from
the
chair.

Cersei
frowned.
вЂњI
havenвЂ™t
given
you
leave
to
depart.
I
want
to
know
how
you
intend
to
free
Jaime.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
tell
you
when
I
know.
Schemes
are
like
fruit,
they
require
a
certain
ripening.
Right
now,
I
have
a
mind
to
ride
through
the
streets
and
take
the
measure
of
this
city.вЂќ
Tyrion
rested
his
hand
on
the
head
of
the
sphinx
beside
the
door.
вЂњOne
parting
request.
Kindly
make
certain
no
harm
comes
to
Sansa
Stark.
It
would
not
do
to
lose
both
the
daughters.вЂќ

Outside
the
council
chamber,
Tyrion
nodded
to
Ser
Mandon
and
made
his
way
down
the
long
vaulted
hall.
Bronn
fell
in
beside
him.
Of
Timett
son
of
Timett
there
was
no
sign.
вЂњWhereвЂ™s
our
red
hand?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked.

вЂњHe
felt
an
urge
to
explore.
His
kind
was
not
made
for
waiting
about
in
halls.вЂќ

вЂњI
hope
he
doesnвЂ™t
kill
anyone
important.вЂќ
The
clansmen
Tyrion
had
brought
down
from
their
fastnesses
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
were
loyal
in
their
own
fierce
way,
but
they
were
proud
and
quarrelsome
as
well,
prone
to
answer
insults
real
or
imagined
with
steel.
вЂњTry
to
find
him.
And
while
you
are
at
it,
see
that
the
rest
have
been
quartered
and
fed.
I
want
them
in
the
barracks
beneath
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
donвЂ™t
let
the
steward
put
the
Stone
Crows
near
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
tell
him
the
Burned
Men
must
have
a
hall
all
to
themselves.вЂќ

вЂњWhere
will
you
be?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
riding
back
to
the
Broken
Anvil.вЂќ

Bronn
grinned
insolently.
вЂњNeed
an
escort?
The
talk
is,
the
streets
are
dangerous.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
call
upon
the
captain
of
my
sisterвЂ™s
household
guard,
and
remind
him
that
I
am
no
less
a
Lannister
than
she
is.
He
needs
to
recall
that
his
oath
is
to
Casterly
Rock,
not
to
Cersei
or
Joffrey.вЂќ

An
hour
later,
Tyrion
rode
from
the
Red
Keep
accompanied
by
a
dozen
Lannister
guardsmen
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
halfhelms.
As
they
passed
beneath
the
portcullis,
he
noted
the
heads
mounted
atop
the
walls.
Black
with
rot
and
old
tar,
they
had
long
since
become
unrecognizable.
вЂњCaptain
Vylarr,вЂќ
he
called,
вЂњI
want
those
taken
down
on
the
morrow.
Give
them
to
the
silent
sisters
for
cleaning.вЂќ
It
would
be
hell
to
match
them
with
the
bodies,
he
supposed,
yet
it
must
be
done.
Even
in
the
midst
of
war
certain
decencies
needed
to
be
observed.

Vylarr
grew
hesitant.
вЂњHis
Grace
has
told
us
he
wishes
the
traitorsвЂ™
heads
to
remain
on
the
walls
until
he
fills
those
last
three
empty
spikes
there
on
the
end.вЂќ

вЂњLet
me
hazard
a
wild
stab.
One
is
for
Robb
Stark,
the
others
for
Lords
Stannis
and
Renly.
Would
that
be
right?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњMy
nephew
is
thirteen
years
old
today,
Vylarr.
Try
and
recall
that.
IвЂ™ll
have
the
heads
down
on
the
morrow,
or
one
of
those
empty
spikes
may
have
a
different
lodger.
Do
you
take
my
meaning,
Captain?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
see
that
theyвЂ™re
taken
down
myself,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњGood.вЂќ
Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
trotted
away,
leaving
the
red
cloaks
to
follow
as
best
they
could.

He
had
told
Cersei
he
intended
to
take
the
measure
of
the
city.
That
was
not
entirely
a
lie.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
pleased
by
much
of
what
he
saw.
The
streets
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing
had
always
been
teeming
and
raucous
and
noisy,
but
now
they
reeked
of
danger
in
a
way
that
he
did
not
recall
from
past
visits.
A
naked
corpse
sprawled
in
the
gutter
near
the
Street
of
Looms,
being
torn
at
by
a
pack
of
feral
dogs,
yet
no
one
seemed
to
care.
Watchmen
were
much
in
evidence,
moving
in
pairs
through
the
alleys
in
their
gold
cloaks
and
shirts
of
black
ringmail,
iron
cudgels
never
far
from
their
hands.
The
markets
were
crowded
with
ragged
men
selling
their
household
goods
for
any
price
they
could
getвЂ¦
and
conspicuously
empty
of
farmers
selling
food.
What
little
produce
he
did
see
was
three
times
as
costly
as
it
had
been
a
year
ago.
One
peddler
was
hawking
rats
roasted
on
a
skewer.
вЂњFresh
rats,вЂќ
he
cried
loudly,
вЂњfresh
rats.вЂќ
Doubtless
fresh
rats
were
to
be
preferred
to
old
stale
rotten
rats.
The
frightening
thing
was,
the
rats
looked
more
appetizing
than
most
of
what
the
butchers
were
selling.
On
the
Street
of
Flour,
Tyrion
saw
guards
at
every
other
shop
door.
When
times
grew
lean,
even
bakers
found
sellswords
cheaper
than
bread,
he
reflected.

вЂњThere
is
no
food
coming
in,
is
there?вЂќ
he
said
to
Vylarr.

вЂњLittle
enough,вЂќ
the
captain
admitted.
вЂњWith
the
war
in
the
riverlands
and
Lord
Renly
raising
rebels
in
Highgarden,
the
roads
are
closed
to
south
and
west.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
has
my
good
sister
done
about
this?вЂќ

вЂњShe
is
taking
steps
to
restore
the
kingвЂ™s
peace,вЂќ
Vylarr
assured
him.
вЂњLord
Slynt
has
tripled
the
size
of
the
City
Watch,
and
the
queen
has
put
a
thousand
craftsmen
to
work
on
our
defenses.
The
stonemasons
are
strengthening
the
walls,
carpenters
are
building
scorpions
and
catapults
by
the
hundred,
fletchers
are
making
arrows,
the
smiths
are
forging
blades,
and
the
AlchemistsвЂ™
Guild
has
pledged
ten
thousand
jars
of
wildfire.вЂќ

Tyrion
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
saddle.
He
was
pleased
that
Cersei
had
not
been
idle,
but
wildfire
was
treacherous
stuff,
and
ten
thousand
jars
were
enough
to
turn
all
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing
into
cinders.
вЂњWhere
has
my
sister
found
the
coin
to
pay
for
all
of
this?вЂќ
It
was
no
secret
that
King
Robert
had
left
the
crown
vastly
in
debt,
and
alchemists
were
seldom
mistaken
for
altruists.

вЂњLord
Littlefinger
always
finds
a
way,
my
lord.
He
has
imposed
a
tax
on
those
wishing
to
enter
the
city.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
that
would
work,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
thinking,
Clever.
Clever
and
cruel.
Tens
of
thousands
had
fled
the
fighting
for
the
supposed
safety
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
He
had
seen
them
on
the
kingsroad,
troupes
of
mothers
and
children
and
anxious
fathers
who
had
gazed
on
his
horses
and
wagons
with
covetous
eyes.
Once
they
reached
the
city
they
would
doubtless
pay
over
all
they
had
to
put
those
high
comforting
walls
between
them
and
the
warвЂ¦
though
they
might
think
twice
if
they
knew
about
the
wildfire.

The
inn
beneath
the
sign
of
the
broken
anvil
stood
within
sight
of
those
walls,
near
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
where
they
had
entered
that
morning.
As
they
rode
into
its
courtyard,
a
boy
ran
out
to
help
Tyrion
down
from
his
horse.
вЂњTake
your
men
back
to
the
castle,вЂќ
he
told
Vylarr.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
spending
the
night
here.вЂќ

The
captain
looked
dubious.
вЂњWill
you
be
safe,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњWell,
as
to
that,
Captain,
when
I
left
the
inn
this
morning
it
was
full
of
Black
Ears.
One
is
never
quite
safe
when
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
is
about.вЂќ
Tyrion
waddled
toward
the
door,
leaving
Vylarr
to
puzzle
at
his
meaning.

A
gust
of
merriment
greeted
him
as
he
shoved
into
the
innвЂ™s
common
room.
He
recognized
ChellaвЂ™s
throaty
chuckle
and
the
lighter
music
of
ShaeвЂ™s
laughter.
The
girl
was
seated
by
the
hearth,
sipping
wine
at
a
round
wooden
table
with
three
of
the
Black
Ears
heвЂ™d
left
to
guard
her
and
a
plump
man
whose
back
was
to
him.
The
innkeeper,
he
assumedвЂ¦
until
Shae
called
Tyrion
by
name
and
the
intruder
rose.
вЂњMy
good
lord,
I
am
so
pleased
to
see
you,вЂќ
he
gushed,
a
soft
eunuchвЂ™s
smile
on
his
powdered
face.

Tyrion
stumbled.
вЂњLord
Varys.
I
had
not
thought
to
see
you
here.вЂќ
The
Others
take
him,
how
did
he
find
them
so
quickly?

вЂњForgive
me
if
I
intrude,вЂќ
Varys
said.
вЂњI
was
taken
by
a
sudden
urge
to
meet
your
young
lady.вЂќ

вЂњYoung
lady,вЂќ
Shae
repeated,
savoring
the
words.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
half
right,
mвЂ™lord.
IвЂ™m
young.вЂќ

Eighteen,
Tyrion
thought.
Eighteen,
and
a
whore,
but
quick
of
wit,
nimble
as
a
cat
between
the
sheets,
with
large
dark
eyes
and
fine
black
hair
and
a
sweet,
soft,
hungry
little
mouthвЂ¦
and
mine!
Damn
you,
eunuch.
вЂњI
fear
IвЂ™m
the
intruder,
Lord
Varys,вЂќ
he
said
with
forced
courtesy.
вЂњWhen
I
came
in,
you
were
in
the
midst
of
some
merriment.вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord
Varys
complimented
Chella
on
her
ears
and
said
she
must
have
killed
many
men
to
have
such
a
fine
necklace,вЂќ
Shae
explained.
It
grated
on
him
to
hear
her
call
Varys
mвЂ™lord
in
that
tone;
that
was
what
she
called
him
in
their
pillow
play.
вЂњAnd
Chella
told
him
only
cowards
kill
the
vanquished.вЂќ

вЂњBraver
to
leave
the
man
alive,
with
a
chance
to
cleanse
his
shame
by
winning
back
his
ear,вЂќ
explained
Chella,
a
small
dark
woman
whose
grisly
neckware
was
hung
with
no
less
than
forty-six
dried,
wrinkled
ears.
Tyrion
had
counted
them
once.
вЂњOnly
so
can
you
prove
you
do
not
fear
your
enemies.вЂќ

Shae
hooted.
вЂњAnd
then
mвЂ™lord
says
if
he
was
a
Black
Ear
heвЂ™d
never
sleep,
for
dreams
of
one-eared
men.вЂќ

вЂњA
problem
I
will
never
need
face,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњIвЂ™m
terrified
of
my
enemies,
so
I
kill
them
all.вЂќ

Varys
giggled.
вЂњWill
you
take
some
wine
with
us,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
take
some
wine.вЂќ
Tyrion
seated
himself
beside
Shae.
He
understood
what
was
happening
here,
if
Chella
and
the
girl
did
not.
Varys
was
delivering
a
message.
When
he
said,
I
was
taken
by
a
sudden
urge
to
meet
your
young
lady,
what
he
meant
was,
You
tried
to
hide
her,
but
I
knew
where
she
was,
and
who
she
was,
and
here
I
am.
He
wondered
who
had
betrayed
him.
The
innkeeper,
that
boy
in
the
stable,
a
guard
on
the
gateвЂ¦
or
one
of
his
own?

вЂњI
always
like
to
return
to
the
city
through
the
Gate
of
the
Gods,вЂќ
Varys
told
Shae
as
he
filled
the
wine
cups.
вЂњThe
carvings
on
the
gatehouse
are
exquisite,
they
make
me
weep
each
time
I
see
them.
The
eyesвЂ¦
so
expressive,
donвЂ™t
you
think?
They
almost
seem
to
follow
you
as
you
ride
beneath
the
portcullis.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
noticed,
mвЂ™lord,вЂќ
Shae
replied.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
look
again
on
the
morrow,
if
it
please
you.вЂќ

DonвЂ™t
bother,
sweetling,
Tyrion
thought,
swirling
the
wine
in
the
cup.
He
cares
not
a
whit
about
carvings.
The
eyes
he
boasts
of
are
his
own.
What
he
means
is
that
he
was
watching,
that
he
knew
we
were
here
the
moment
we
passed
through
the
gates.

вЂњDo
be
careful,
child,вЂќ
Varys
urged.
вЂњKingвЂ™s
Landing
is
not
wholly
safe
these
days.
I
know
these
streets
well,
and
yet
I
almost
feared
to
come
today,
alone
and
unarmed
as
I
was.
Lawless
men
are
everywhere
in
this
dark
time,
oh,
yes.
Men
with
cold
steel
and
colder
hearts.вЂќ
Where
I
can
come
alone
and
unarmed,
others
can
come
with
swords
in
their
fists,
he
was
saying.

Shae
only
laughed.
вЂњIf
they
try
and
bother
me,
theyвЂ™ll
be
one
ear
short
when
Chella
runs
them
off.вЂќ

Varys
hooted
as
if
that
was
the
funniest
thing
he
had
ever
heard,
but
there
was
no
laughter
in
his
eyes
when
he
turned
them
on
Tyrion.
вЂњYour
young
lady
has
an
amiable
way
to
her.
I
should
take
very
good
care
of
her
if
I
were
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
intend
to.
Any
man
who
tries
to
harm
herвЂ”well,
IвЂ™m
too
small
to
be
a
Black
Ear,
and
I
make
no
claims
to
courage.вЂќ
See?
I
speak
the
same
tongue
you
do,
eunuch.
Hurt
her,
and
IвЂ™ll
have
your
head.

вЂњI
will
leave
you.вЂќ
Varys
rose.
вЂњI
know
how
weary
you
must
be.
I
only
wished
to
welcome
you,
my
lord,
and
tell
you
how
very
pleased
I
am
by
your
arrival.
We
have
dire
need
of
you
on
the
council.
Have
you
seen
the
comet?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
short,
not
blind,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
Out
on
the
kingsroad,
it
had
seemed
to
cover
half
the
sky,
outshining
the
crescent
moon.

вЂњIn
the
streets,
they
call
it
the
Red
Messenger,вЂќ
Varys
said.
вЂњThey
say
it
comes
as
a
herald
before
a
king,
to
warn
of
fire
and
blood
to
follow.вЂќ
The
eunuch
rubbed
his
powdered
hands
together.
вЂњMay
I
leave
you
with
a
bit
of
a
riddle,
Lord
Tyrion?вЂќ
He
did
not
wait
for
an
answer.
вЂњIn
a
room
sit
three
great
men,
a
king,
a
priest,
and
a
rich
man
with
his
gold.
Between
them
stands
a
sellsword,
a
little
man
of
common
birth
and
no
great
mind.
Each
of
the
great
ones
bids
him
slay
the
other
two.
вЂDo
itвЂ™
says
the
king,
вЂfor
I
am
your
lawful
ruler.вЂ™
вЂDo
itвЂ™
says
the
priest,
вЂfor
I
command
you
in
the
names
of
the
gods.вЂ™
вЂDo
itвЂ™
says
the
rich
man,
вЂand
all
this
gold
shall
be
yours.вЂ™
So
tell
meвЂ”who
lives
and
who
dies?вЂќ
Bowing
deeply,
the
eunuch
hurried
from
the
common
room
on
soft
slippered
feet.

When
he
was
gone,
Chella
gave
a
snort
and
Shae
wrinkled
up
her
pretty
face.
вЂњThe
rich
man
lives.
DoesnвЂ™t
he?вЂќ

Tyrion
sipped
at
his
wine,
thoughtful.
вЂњPerhaps.
Or
not.
That
would
depend
on
the
sellsword,
it
seems.вЂќ
He
set
down
his
cup.
вЂњCome,
letвЂ™s
go
upstairs.вЂќ

She
had
to
wait
for
him
at
the
top
of
the
steps,
for
her
legs
were
slim
and
supple
while
his
were
short
and
stunted
and
full
of
aches.
But
she
was
smiling
when
he
reached
her.
вЂњDid
you
miss
me?вЂќ
she
teased
as
she
took
his
hand.

вЂњDesperately,вЂќ
Tyrion
admitted.
Shae
only
stood
a
shade
over
five
feet,
yet
still
he
must
look
up
to
herвЂ¦
but
in
her
case
he
found
he
did
not
mind.
She
was
sweet
to
look
up
at.

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
miss
me
all
the
time
in
your
Red
Keep,вЂќ
she
said
as
she
led
him
to
her
room.
вЂњAll
alone
in
your
cold
bed
in
your
Tower
of
the
Hand.вЂќ

вЂњToo
true.вЂќ
Tyrion
would
gladly
have
kept
her
with
him,
but
his
lord
father
had
forbidden
it.
You
will
not
take
the
whore
to
court,
Lord
Tywin
had
commanded.
Bringing
her
to
the
city
was
as
much
defiance
as
he
dared.
All
his
authority
derived
from
his
father,
the
girl
had
to
understand
that.
вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
be
far,вЂќ
he
promised.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
have
a
house,
with
guards
and
servants,
and
IвЂ™ll
visit
as
often
as
IвЂ™m
able.вЂќ

Shae
kicked
shut
the
door.
Through
the
cloudy
panes
of
the
narrow
window,
he
could
make
out
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
crowning
VisenyaвЂ™s
Hill
but
Tyrion
was
distracted
by
a
different
sight.
Bending,
Shae
took
her
gown
by
the
hem,
drew
it
over
her
head,
and
tossed
it
aside.
She
did
not
believe
in
smallclothes.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
never
be
able
to
rest,вЂќ
she
said
as
she
stood
before
him,
pink
and
nude
and
lovely,
one
hand
braced
on
her
hip.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
think
of
me
every
time
you
go
to
bed.
Then
youвЂ™ll
get
hard
and
youвЂ™ll
have
no
one
to
help
you
and
youвЂ™ll
never
be
able
to
sleep
unless
youвЂќвЂ”she
grinned
that
wicked
grin
Tyrion
liked
so
wellвЂ”вЂњis
that
why
they
call
it
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
mвЂ™lord?вЂќ

вЂњBe
quiet
and
kiss
me,вЂќ
he
commanded.

He
could
taste
the
wine
on
her
lips,
and
feel
her
small
firm
breasts
pressed
against
him
as
her
fingers
moved
to
the
lacings
of
his
breeches.
вЂњMy
lion,вЂќ
she
whispered
when
he
broke
off
the
kiss
to
undress.
вЂњMy
sweet
lord,
my
giant
of
Lannister.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
her
toward
the
bed.
When
he
entered
her,
she
screamed
loud
enough
to
wake
Baelor
the
Blessed
in
his
tomb,
and
her
nails
left
gouges
in
his
back.
HeвЂ™d
never
had
a
pain
he
liked
half
so
well.

Fool,
he
thought
to
himself
afterward,
as
they
lay
in
the
center
of
the
sagging
mattress
amidst
the
rumpled
sheets.
Will
you
never
learn,
dwarf?
SheвЂ™s
a
whore,
damn
you,
itвЂ™s
your
coin
she
loves,
not
your
cock.
Remember
Tysha?
Yet
when
his
fingers
trailed
lightly
over
one
nipple,
it
stiffened
at
the
touch,
and
he
could
see
the
mark
on
her
breast
where
heвЂ™d
bitten
her
in
his
passion.

вЂњSo
what
will
you
do,
mвЂ™lord,
now
that
youвЂ™re
the
Hand
of
the
King?вЂќ
Shae
asked
him
as
he
cupped
that
warm
sweet
flesh.

вЂњSomething
Cersei
will
never
expect,вЂќ
Tyrion
murmured
softly
against
her
slender
neck.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
doвЂ¦
justice.вЂќ





BRAN

Bran
preferred
the
hard
stone
of
the
window
seat
to
the
comforts
of
his
featherbed
and
blankets.
Abed,
the
walls
pressed
close
and
the
ceiling
hung
heavy
above
him;
abed,
the
room
was
his
cell,
and
Winterfell
his
prison.
Yet
outside
his
window,
the
wide
world
still
called.

He
could
not
walk,
nor
climb
nor
hunt
nor
fight
with
a
wooden
sword
as
once
he
had,
but
he
could
still
look.
He
liked
to
watch
the
windows
begin
to
glow
all
over
Winterfell
as
candles
and
hearth
fires
were
lit
behind
the
diamond-shaped
panes
of
tower
and
hall,
and
he
loved
to
listen
to
the
direwolves
sing
to
the
stars.

Of
late,
he
often
dreamed
of
wolves.
They
are
talking
to
me,
brother
to
brother,
he
told
himself
when
the
direwolves
howled.
He
could
almost
understand
themвЂ¦
not
quite,
not
truly,
but
almostвЂ¦
as
if
they
were
singing
in
a
language
he
had
once
known
and
somehow
forgotten.
The
Walders
might
be
scared
of
them,
but
the
Starks
had
wolf
blood.
Old
Nan
told
him
so.
вЂњThough
it
is
stronger
in
some
than
in
others,вЂќ
she
warned.

SummerвЂ™s
howls
were
long
and
sad,
full
of
grief
and
longing.
ShaggydogвЂ™s
were
more
savage.
Their
voices
echoed
through
the
yards
and
halls
until
the
castle
rang
and
it
seemed
as
though
some
great
pack
of
direwolves
haunted
Winterfell,
instead
of
only
twoвЂ¦
two
where
there
had
once
been
six.
Do
they
miss
their
brothers
and
sisters
too?
Bran
wondered.
Are
they
calling
to
Grey
Wind
and
Ghost,
to
Nymeria
and
LadyвЂ™s
Shade?
Do
they
want
them
to
come
home
and
be
a
pack
together?

вЂњWho
can
know
the
mind
of
a
wolf?вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
said
when
Bran
asked
him
why
they
howled.
BranвЂ™s
lady
mother
had
named
him
castellan
of
Winterfell
in
her
absence,
and
his
duties
left
him
little
time
for
idle
questions.

вЂњItвЂ™s
freedom
theyвЂ™re
calling
for,вЂќ
declared
Farlen,
who
was
kennelmaster
and
had
no
more
love
for
the
direwolves
than
his
hounds
did.
вЂњThey
donвЂ™t
like
being
walled
up,
and
whoвЂ™s
to
blame
them?
Wild
things
belong
in
the
wild,
not
in
a
castle.вЂќ

вЂњThey
want
to
hunt,вЂќ
agreed
Gage
the
cook
as
he
tossed
cubes
of
suet
in
a
great
kettle
of
stew.
вЂњA
wolf
smells
betterвЂ™n
any
man.
Like
as
not,
theyвЂ™ve
caught
the
scent
oвЂ™
prey.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
did
not
think
so.
вЂњWolves
often
howl
at
the
moon.
These
are
howling
at
the
comet.
See
how
bright
it
is,
Bran?
Perchance
they
think
it
is
the
moon.вЂќ

When
Bran
repeated
that
to
Osha,
she
laughed
aloud.
вЂњYour
wolves
have
more
wit
than
your
maester,вЂќ
the
wildling
woman
said.
вЂњThey
know
truths
the
grey
man
has
forgotten.вЂќ
The
way
she
said
it
made
him
shiver,
and
when
he
asked
what
the
comet
meant,
she
answered,
вЂњBlood
and
fire,
boy,
and
nothing
sweet.вЂќ

Bran
asked
Septon
Chayle
about
the
comet
while
they
were
sorting
through
some
scrolls
snatched
from
the
library
fire.
вЂњIt
is
the
sword
that
slays
the
season,вЂќ
he
replied,
and
soon
after
the
white
raven
came
from
Oldtown
bringing
word
of
autumn,
so
doubtless
he
was
right.

Though
Old
Nan
did
not
think
so,
and
sheвЂ™d
lived
longer
than
any
of
them.
вЂњDragons,вЂќ
she
said,
lifting
her
head
and
sniffing.
She
was
near
blind
and
could
not
see
the
comet,
yet
she
claimed
she
could
smell
it.
вЂњIt
be
dragons,
boy,вЂќ
she
insisted.
Bran
got
no
princes
from
Nan,
no
more
than
he
ever
had.

Hodor
said
only,
вЂњHodor.вЂќ
That
was
all
he
ever
said.

And
still
the
direwolves
howled.
The
guards
on
the
walls
muttered
curses,
hounds
in
the
kennels
barked
furiously,
horses
kicked
at
their
stalls,
the
Walders
shivered
by
their
fire,
and
even
Maester
Luwin
complained
of
sleepless
nights.
Only
Bran
did
not
mind.
Ser
Rodrik
had
confined
the
wolves
to
the
godswood
after
Shaggydog
bit
Little
Walder,
but
the
stones
of
Winterfell
played
queer
tricks
with
sound,
and
sometimes
it
sounded
as
if
they
were
in
the
yard
right
below
BranвЂ™s
window.
Other
times
he
would
have
sworn
they
were
up
on
the
curtain
walls,
loping
round
like
sentries.
He
wished
that
he
could
see
them.

He
could
see
the
comet
hanging
above
the
Guards
Hall
and
the
Bell
Tower,
and
farther
back
the
First
Keep,
squat
and
round,
its
gargoyles
black
shapes
against
the
bruised
purple
dusk.
Once
Bran
had
known
every
stone
of
those
buildings,
inside
and
out;
he
had
climbed
them
all,
scampering
up
walls
as
easily
as
other
boys
ran
down
stairs.
Their
rooftops
had
been
his
secret
places,
and
the
crows
atop
the
broken
tower
his
special
friends.

And
then
he
had
fallen.

Bran
did
not
remember
falling,
yet
they
said
he
had,
so
he
supposed
it
must
be
true.
He
had
almost
died.
When
he
saw
the
weatherworn
gargoyles
atop
the
First
Keep
where
it
had
happened,
he
got
a
queer
tight
feeling
in
his
belly.
And
now
he
could
not
climb,
nor
walk
nor
run
nor
swordfight,
and
the
dreams
heвЂ™d
dreamed
of
knighthood
had
soured
in
his
head.

Summer
had
howled
the
day
Bran
had
fallen,
and
for
long
after
as
he
lay
broken
in
his
bed;
Robb
had
told
him
so
before
he
went
away
to
war.
Summer
had
mourned
for
him,
and
Shaggydog
and
Grey
Wind
had
joined
in
his
grief.
And
the
night
the
bloody
raven
had
brought
word
of
their
fatherвЂ™s
death,
the
wolves
had
known
that
too.
Bran
had
been
in
the
maesterвЂ™s
turret
with
Rickon
talking
of
the
children
of
the
forest
when
Summer
and
Shaggydog
had
drowned
out
Luwin
with
their
howls.

Who
are
they
mourning
now?
Had
some
enemy
slain
the
King
in
the
North,
who
used
to
be
his
brother
Robb?
Had
his
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow
fallen
from
the
Wall?
Had
his
mother
died,
or
one
of
his
sisters?
Or
was
this
something
else,
as
maester
and
septon
and
Old
Nan
seemed
to
think?

If
I
were
truly
a
direwolf,
I
would
understand
the
song,
he
thought
wistfully.
In
his
wolf
dreams,
he
could
race
up
the
sides
of
mountains,
jagged
icy
mountains
taller
than
any
tower,
and
stand
at
the
summit
beneath
the
full
moon
with
all
the
world
below
him,
the
way
it
used
to
be.

вЂњOooo,вЂќ
Bran
cried
tentatively.
He
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth
and
lifted
his
head
to
the
comet.
вЂњOoooooooooooooooooo,
ahooooooooooooooo,вЂќ
he
howled.
it
sounded
stupid,
high
and
hollow
and
quavering,
a
little
boyвЂ™s
howl,
not
a
wolfвЂ™s.
Yet
Summer
gave
answer,
his
deep
voice
drowning
out
BranвЂ™s
thin
one,
and
Shaggydog
made
it
a
chorus.
Bran
haroooed
again.
They
howled
together,
last
of
their
pack.

The
noise
brought
a
guard
to
his
door,
Hayhead
with
the
wen
on
his
nose.
He
peered
in,
saw
Bran
howling
out
the
window,
and
said,
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
this,
my
prince?вЂќ

It
made
Bran
feel
queer
when
they
called
him
prince,
though
he
was
RobbвЂ™s
heir,
and
Robb
was
King
in
the
North
now.
He
turned
his
head
to
howl
at
the
guard.
вЂњOooooooo.
Oo-oo-oooooooooooo.вЂќ

Hayhead
screwed
up
his
face.
вЂњNow
you
stop
that
there.вЂќ

вЂњOoo-ooo-Oooooo.
Ooo-Ooo-Ooooooooooooooooo.вЂќ

The
guardsman
retreated.
When
he
came
back,
Maester
Luwin
was
with
him,
all
in
grey,
his
chain
tight
about
his
neck.
вЂњBran,
those
beasts
make
sufficient
noise
without
your
help.вЂќ
He
crossed
the
room
and
put
his
hand
on
the
boyвЂ™s
brow.
вЂњThe
hour
grows
late,
you
ought
to
be
fast
asleep.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
talking
to
the
wolves.вЂќ
Bran
brushed
the
hand
away.

вЂњShall
I
have
Hayhead
carry
you
to
your
bed?вЂќ

вЂњI
can
get
to
bed
myself.вЂќ
Mikken
had
hammered
a
row
of
iron
bars
into
the
wall,
so
Bran
could
pull
himself
about
the
room
with
his
arms.
It
was
slow
and
hard
and
it
made
his
shoulders
ache,
but
he
hated
being
carried.
вЂњAnyway,
I
donвЂ™t
have
to
sleep
if
I
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ

вЂњAll
men
must
sleep,
Bran.
Even
princes.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
I
sleep
I
turn
into
a
wolf.вЂќ
Bran
turned
his
face
away
and
looked
back
out
into
the
night.
вЂњDo
wolves
dream?вЂќ

вЂњAll
creatures
dream,
I
think,
yet
not
as
men
do.вЂќ

вЂњDo
dead
men
dream?вЂќ
Bran
asked,
thinking
of
his
father.
In
the
dark
crypts
below
Winterfell,
a
stonemason
was
chiseling
out
his
fatherвЂ™s
likeness
in
granite.

вЂњSome
say
yes,
some
no,вЂќ
the
maester
answered.
вЂњThe
dead
themselves
are
silent
on
the
matter.вЂќ

вЂњDo
trees
dream?вЂќ

вЂњTrees?
NoвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThey
do,вЂќ
Bran
said
with
sudden
certainty.
вЂњThey
dream
tree
dreams.
I
dream
of
a
tree
sometimes.
A
weirwood,
like
the
one
in
the
godswood.
It
calls
to
me.
The
wolf
dreams
are
better.
I
smell
things,
and
sometimes
I
can
taste
the
blood.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
where
it
chafed
his
neck.
вЂњIf
you
would
only
spend
more
time
with
the
other
childrenвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
hate
the
other
children,вЂќ
Bran
said,
meaning
the
Walders.
вЂњI
commanded
you
to
send
them
away.вЂќ

Luwin
grew
stern.
вЂњThe
Freys
are
your
lady
motherвЂ™s
wards,
sent
here
to
be
fostered
at
her
express
command.
It
is
not
for
you
to
expel
them,
nor
is
it
kind.
If
we
turned
them
out,
where
would
they
go?вЂќ

вЂњHome.
ItвЂ™s
their
fault
you
wonвЂ™t
let
me
have
Summer.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Frey
boy
did
not
ask
to
be
attacked,вЂќ
the
maester
said,
вЂњno
more
than
I
did.вЂќ

вЂњThat
was
Shaggydog.вЂќ
RickonвЂ™s
big
black
wolf
was
so
wild
he
even
frightened
Bran
at
times.
вЂњSummer
never
bit
anyone.вЂќ

вЂњSummer
ripped
out
a
manвЂ™s
throat
in
this
very
chamber,
or
have
you
forgotten?
The
truth
is,
those
sweet
pups
you
and
your
brothers
found
in
the
snow
have
grown
into
dangerous
beasts.
The
Frey
boys
are
wise
to
be
wary
of
them.вЂќ

вЂњWe
should
put
the
Walders
in
the
godswood.
They
could
play
lord
of
the
crossing
all
they
want,
and
Summer
could
sleep
with
me
again.
If
IвЂ™m
the
prince,
why
wonвЂ™t
you
heed
me?
I
wanted
to
ride
Dancer,
but
Alebelly
wouldnвЂ™t
let
me
past
the
gate.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
rightly
so.
The
wolfswood
is
full
of
danger;
your
last
ride
should
have
taught
you
that.
Would
you
want
some
outlaw
to
take
you
captive
and
sell
you
to
the
Lannisters?вЂќ

вЂњSummer
would
save
me,вЂќ
Bran
insisted
stubbornly.
вЂњPrinces
should
be
allowed
to
sail
the
sea
and
hunt
boar
in
the
wolfswood
and
joust
with
lances.вЂќ

вЂњBran,
child,
why
do
you
torment
yourself
so?
One
day
you
may
do
some
of
these
things,
but
now
you
are
only
a
boy
of
eight.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
be
a
wolf.
Then
I
could
live
in
the
wood
and
sleep
when
I
wanted,
and
I
could
find
Arya
and
Sansa.
IвЂ™d
smell
where
they
were
and
go
save
them,
and
when
Robb
went
to
battle
IвЂ™d
fight
beside
him
like
Grey
Wind.
IвЂ™d
tear
out
the
KingslayerвЂ™s
throat
with
my
teeth,
rip,
and
then
the
war
would
be
over
and
everyone
would
come
back
to
Winterfell.
If
I
was
a
wolfвЂ¦вЂќ
He
howled.
вЂњOoo-ooo-oooooooooooo.вЂќ

Luwin
raised
his
voice.
вЂњA
true
prince
would
welcomeвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњAAHOOOOOOO,вЂќ
Bran
howled,
louder.
вЂњAAHOOOOOOOOOOOO.вЂќ

The
maester
surrendered.
вЂњAs
you
will,
child.вЂќ
With
a
look
that
was
part
grief
and
part
disgust,
he
left
the
bedchamber.

Howling
lost
its
savor
once
Bran
was
alone.
After
a
time
he
quieted.
I
did
welcome
them,
he
told
himself,
resentful.
I
was
the
lord
in
Winterfell,
a
true
lord,
he
canвЂ™t
say
I
wasnвЂ™t.
When
the
Walders
had
arrived
from
the
Twins,
it
had
been
Rickon
who
wanted
them
gone.
A
baby
of
four,
he
had
screamed
that
he
wanted
Mother
and
Father
and
Robb,
not
these
strangers.
It
had
been
up
to
Bran
to
soothe
him
and
bid
the
Freys
welcome.
He
had
offered
them
meat
and
mead
and
a
seat
by
the
fire,
and
even
Maester
Luwin
had
said
afterward
that
heвЂ™d
done
well.

Only
that
was
before
the
game.

The
game
was
played
with
a
log,
a
staff,
a
body
of
water,
and
a
great
deal
of
shouting.
The
water
was
the
most
important,
Walder
and
Walder
assured
Bran.
You
could
use
a
plank
or
even
a
series
of
stones,
and
a
branch
could
be
your
staff.
You
didnвЂ™t
have
to
shout.
But
without
water,
there
was
no
game.
As
Maester
Luwin
and
Ser
Rodrik
were
not
about
to
let
the
children
go
wandering
off
into
the
wolfswood
in
search
of
a
stream,
they
made
do
with
one
of
the
murky
pools
in
the
godswood.
Walder
and
Walder
had
never
seen
hot
water
bubbling
from
the
ground
before,
but
they
both
allowed
how
it
would
make
the
game
even
better.

Both
of
them
were
called
Walder
Frey.
Big
Walder
said
there
were
bunches
of
Walders
at
the
Twins,
all
named
after
the
boysвЂ™
grandfather,
Lord
Walder
Frey.
вЂњWe
have
our
own
names
at
Winterfell,вЂќ
Rickon
told
them
haughtily
when
he
heard
that.

The
way
their
game
was
played,
you
laid
the
log
across
the
water,
and
one
player
stood
in
the
middle
with
the
stick.
He
was
the
lord
of
the
crossing,
and
when
one
of
the
other
players
came
up,
he
had
to
say,
вЂњI
am
the
lord
of
the
crossing,
who
goes
there?вЂќ
And
the
other
player
had
to
make
up
a
speech
about
who
they
were
and
why
they
should
be
allowed
to
cross.
The
lord
could
make
them
swear
oaths
and
answer
questions.
They
didnвЂ™t
have
to
tell
the
truth,
but
the
oaths
were
binding
unless
they
said
вЂњMaybaps,вЂќ
so
the
trick
was
to
say
вЂњMayhapsвЂќ
so
the
lord
of
the
crossing
didnвЂ™t
notice.
Then
you
could
try
and
knock
the
lord
into
the
water
and
you
got
to
be
lord
of
the
crossing,
but
only
if
youвЂ™d
said
вЂњMayhaps.вЂќ
Otherwise
you
were
out
of
the
game.
The
lord
got
to
knock
anyone
in
the
water
anytime
he
pleased,
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
got
to
use
a
stick.

In
practice,
the
game
seemed
to
come
down
to
mostly
shoving,
hitting,
and
falling
into
the
water,
along
with
a
lot
of
loud
arguments
about
whether
or
not
someone
had
said
вЂњMayhaps.вЂќ
Little
Walder
was
lord
of
the
crossing
more
often
than
not.

He
was
Little
Walder
even
though
he
was
tall
and
stout,
with
a
red
face
and
a
big
round
belly.
Big
Walder
was
sharp-faced
and
skinny
and
half
a
foot
shorter.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
fifty-two
days
older
than
me,вЂќ
Little
Walder
explained,
вЂњso
he
was
bigger
at
first,
but
I
grew
faster.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™re
cousins,
not
brothers,вЂќ
added
Big
Walder,
the
little
one.
вЂњIвЂ™m
Walder
son
of
Jammos.
My
father
was
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
son
by
his
fourth
wife.
HeвЂ™s
Walder
son
of
Merrett.
His
grandmother
was
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
third
wife,
the
Crakehall.
HeвЂ™s
ahead
of
me
in
the
line
of
succession
even
though
IвЂ™m
older.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
by
fifty-two
days,вЂќ
Little
Walder
objected.
вЂњAnd
neither
of
us
will
ever
hold
the
Twins,
stupid.вЂќ

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
Big
Walder
declared.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
not
the
only
Walders
either.
Ser
Stevron
has
a
grandson,
Black
Walder,
heвЂ™s
fourth
in
line
of
succession,
and
thereвЂ™s
Red
Walder,
Ser
EmmonвЂ™s
son,
and
Bastard
Walder,
who
isnвЂ™t
in
the
line
at
all.
HeвЂ™s
called
Walder
Rivers
not
Walder
Frey.
Plus
thereвЂ™s
girls
named
Walda.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Tyr.
You
always
forget
Tyr.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
Waltyr,
not
Walder,вЂќ
Big
Walder
said
airily.
вЂњAnd
heвЂ™s
after
us,
so
he
doesnвЂ™t
matter.
Anyhow,
I
never
liked
him.вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
decreed
that
they
would
share
Jon
SnowвЂ™s
old
bedchamber,
since
Jon
was
in
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
and
never
coming
back.
Bran
hated
that;
it
made
him
feel
as
if
the
Freys
were
trying
to
steal
JonвЂ™s
place.

He
had
watched
wistfully
while
the
Walders
contested
with
Turnip
the
cookвЂ™s
boy
and
JosethвЂ™s
girls
Bandy
and
Shyra.
The
Walders
had
decreed
that
Bran
should
be
the
judge
and
decide
whether
or
not
people
had
said
вЂњMayhaps,вЂќ
but
as
soon
as
they
started
playing
they
forgot
all
about
him.

The
shouts
and
splashes
soon
drew
others:
Palla
the
kennel
girl,
CaynвЂ™s
boy
Calon,
Tom
Too
whose
father
Fat
Tom
had
died
with
BranвЂ™s
father
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Before
very
long,
every
one
of
them
was
soaked
and
muddy.
Palla
was
brown
from
head
to
heel,
with
moss
in
her
hair,
breathless
from
laughter.
Bran
had
not
heard
so
much
laughing
since
the
night
the
bloody
raven
came.
If
I
had
my
legs,
IвЂ™d
knock
all
of
them
into
the
water,
he
thought
bitterly.
No
one
would
ever
be
lord
of
the
crossing
but
me.

Finally
Rickon
came
running
into
the
godswood,
Shaggydog
at
his
heels.
He
watched
Turnip
and
Little
Walder
struggle
for
the
stick
until
Turnip
lost
his
footing
and
went
in
with
a
huge
splash,
arms
waving.
Rickon
yelled,
вЂњMe!
Me
now!
I
want
to
play!вЂќ
Little
Walder
beckoned
him
on,
and
Shaggydog
started
to
follow.
вЂњNo,
Shaggy,вЂќ
his
brother
commanded.
вЂњWolves
canвЂ™t
play.
You
stay
with
Bran.вЂќ
And
he
didвЂ¦

вЂ¦until
Little
Walder
had
smacked
Rickon
with
the
stick,
square
across
his
belly.
Before
Bran
could
blink,
the
black
wolf
was
flying
over
the
plank,
there
was
blood
in
the
water,
the
Walders
were
shrieking
red
murder,
Rickon
sat
in
the
mud
laughing,
and
Hodor
came
lumbering
in
shouting
вЂњHodor!
Hodor!
Hodor!вЂќ

After
that,
oddly,
Rickon
decided
he
liked
the
Walders.
They
never
played
lord
of
the
crossing
again,
but
they
played
other
gamesвЂ”monsters
and
maidens,
rats
and
cats,
come-into-my-castle,
all
sorts
of
things.
With
Rickon
by
their
side,
the
Walders
plundered
the
kitchens
for
pies
and
honeycombs,
raced
round
the
walls,
tossed
bones
to
the
pups
in
the
kennels,
and
trained
with
wooden
swords
under
Ser
RodrikвЂ™s
sharp
eye.
Rickon
even
showed
them
the
deep
vaults
under
the
earth
where
the
stonemason
was
carving
fatherвЂ™s
tomb.
вЂњYou
had
no
right!вЂќ
Bran
screamed
at
his
brother
when
he
heard.
вЂњThat
was
our
place,
a
Stark
place!вЂќ
But
Rickon
never
cared.

The
door
to
his
bedchamber
opened.
Maester
Luwin
was
carrying
a
green
jar,
and
this
time
Osha
and
Hayhead
came
with
him.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
made
you
a
sleeping
draught,
Bran.вЂќ

Osha
scooped
him
up
in
her
bony
arms.
She
was
very
tall
for
a
woman,
and
wiry
strong.
She
bore
him
effortlessly
to
his
bed.

вЂњThis
will
give
you
dreamless
sleep,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said
as
he
pulled
the
stopper
from
the
jar.
вЂњSweet,
dreamless
sleep.вЂќ

вЂњIt
will?вЂќ
Bran
said,
wanting
to
believe.

вЂњYes.
Drink.вЂќ

Bran
drank.
The
potion
was
thick
and
chalky,
but
there
was
honey
in
it
so
it
went
down
easy.

вЂњCome
the
morn,
youвЂ™ll
feel
better.вЂќ
Luwin
gave
Bran
a
smile
and
a
pat
as
he
took
his
leave.

Osha
lingered
behind.
вЂњIs
it
the
wolf
dreams
again?вЂќ

Bran
nodded.

вЂњYou
should
not
fight
so
hard,
boy.
I
see
you
talking
to
the
heart
tree.
Might
be
the
gods
are
trying
to
talk
back.вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods?вЂќ
he
murmured,
drowsy
already.
OshaвЂ™s
face
grew
blurry
and
grey.
Sweet,
dreamless
sleep,
Bran
thought.

Yet
when
the
darkness
closed
over
him,
he
found
himself
in
the
godswood,
moving
silently
beneath
green-grey
sentinels
and
gnarled
oaks
as
old
as
time.
I
am
walking,
he
thought,
exulting.
Part
of
him
knew
that
it
was
only
a
dream,
but
even
the
dream
of
walking
was
better
than
the
truth
of
his
bedchamber,
walls
and
ceiling
and
door.

It
was
dark
amongst
the
trees,
but
the
comet
lit
his
way,
and
his
feet
were
sure.
He
was
moving
on
four
good
legs,
strong
and
swift,
and
he
could
feel
the
ground
underfoot,
the
soft
crackling
of
fallen
leaves,
thick
roots
and
hard
stones,
the
deep
layers
of
humus.
It
was
a
good
feeling.

The
smells
filled
his
head,
alive
and
intoxicating;
the
green
muddy
stink
of
the
hot
pools,
the
perfume
of
rich
rotting
earth
beneath
his
paws,
the
squirrels
in
the
oaks.
The
scent
of
squirrel
made
him
remember
the
taste
of
hot
blood
and
the
way
the
bones
would
crack
between
his
teeth.
Slaver
filled
his
mouth.
He
had
eaten
no
more
than
half
a
day
past,
but
there
was
no
joy
in
dead
meat,
even
deer.
He
could
hear
the
squirrels
chittering
and
rustling
above
him,
safe
among
their
leaves,
but
they
knew
better
than
to
come
down
to
where
his
brother
and
he
were
prowling.

He
could
smell
his
brother
too,
a
familiar
scent,
strong
and
earthy,
his
scent
as
black
as
his
coat.
His
brother
was
loping
around
the
walls,
full
of
fury.
Round
and
round
he
went,
night
after
day
after
night,
tireless,
searchingвЂ¦
for
prey,
for
a
way
out,
for
his
mother,
his
littermates,
his
packвЂ¦
searching,
searching,
and
never
finding.

Behind
the
trees
the
walls
rose,
piles
of
dead
man-rock
that
loomed
all
about
this
speck
of
living
wood.
Speckled
grey
they
rose,
and
moss-spotted,
yet
thick
and
strong
and
higher
than
any
wolf
could
hope
to
leap.
Cold
iron
and
splintery
wood
closed
off
the
only
holes
through
the
piled
stones
that
hemmed
them
in.
His
brother
would
stop
at
every
hole
and
bare
his
fangs
in
rage,
but
the
ways
stayed
closed.

He
had
done
the
same
the
first
night,
and
learned
that
it
was
no
good.
Snarls
would
open
no
paths
here.
Circling
the
walls
would
not
push
them
back.
Lifting
a
leg
and
marking
the
trees
would
keep
no
men
away.
The
world
had
tightened
around
them,
but
beyond
the
walled
wood
still
stood
the
great
grey
caves
of
man-rock.
Winterfell,
he
remembered,
the
sound
coming
to
him
suddenly.
Beyond
its
sky-tall
man-cliffs
the
true
world
was
calling,
and
he
knew
he
must
answer
or
die.





ARYA

They
traveled
dawn
to
dusk,
past
woods
and
orchards
and
neatly
tended
fields,
through
small
villages,
crowded
market
towns,
and
stout
holdfasts.
Come
dark,
they
would
make
camp
and
eat
by
the
light
of
the
Red
Sword.
The
men
took
turns
standing
watch.
Arya
would
glimpse
firelight
flickering
through
the
trees
from
the
camps
of
other
travelers.
There
seemed
to
be
more
camps
every
night,
and
more
traffic
on
the
kingsroad
by
day.

Morn,
noon,
and
night
they
came,
old
folks
and
little
children,
big
men
and
small
ones,
barefoot
girls
and
women
with
babes
at
their
breasts.
Some
drove
farm
wagons
or
bumped
along
in
the
back
of
ox
carts.
More
rode:
draft
horses,
ponies,
mules,
donkeys,
anything
that
would
walk
or
run
or
roll.
One
woman
led
a
milk
cow
with
a
little
girl
on
its
back.
Arya
saw
a
smith
pushing
a
wheelbarrow
with
his
tools
inside,
hammers
and
tongs
and
even
an
anvil,
and
a
little
while
later
a
different
man
with
a
different
wheelbarrow,
only
inside
this
one
were
two
babies
in
a
blanket.
Most
came
on
foot,
with
their
goods
on
their
shoulders
and
weary,
wary
looks
upon
their
faces.
They
walked
south,
toward
the
city,
toward
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
and
only
one
in
a
hundred
spared
so
much
as
a
word
for
Yoren
and
his
charges,
traveling
north.
She
wondered
why
no
one
else
was
going
the
same
way
as
them.

Many
of
the
travelers
were
armed;
Arya
saw
daggers
and
dirks,
scythes
and
axes,
and
here
and
there
a
sword.
Some
had
made
clubs
from
tree
limbs,
or
carved
knobby
staffs.
They
fingered
their
weapons
and
gave
lingering
looks
at
the
wagons
as
they
rolled
by,
yet
in
the
end
they
let
the
column
pass.
Thirty
was
too
many,
no
matter
what
they
had
in
those
wagons.

Look
with
your
eyes,
Syrio
had
said,
listen
with
your
ears.

One
day
a
madwoman
began
to
scream
at
them
from
the
side
of
the
road.
вЂњFools!
TheyвЂ™ll
kill
you,
fools!вЂќ
She
was
scarecrow
thin,
with
hollow
eyes
and
bloody
feet.

The
next
morning,
a
sleek
merchant
on
a
grey
mare
reined
up
by
Yoren
and
offered
to
buy
his
wagons
and
everything
in
them
for
a
quarter
of
their
worth.
вЂњItвЂ™s
war,
theyвЂ™ll
take
what
they
want,
youвЂ™ll
do
better
selling
to
me,
my
friend.вЂќ
Yoren
turned
away
with
a
twist
of
his
crooked
shoulders,
and
spat.

Arya
noticed
the
first
grave
that
same
day;
a
small
mound
beside
the
road,
dug
for
a
child.
A
crystal
had
been
set
in
the
soft
earth,
and
Lommy
wanted
to
take
it
until
the
Bull
told
him
heвЂ™d
better
leave
the
dead
alone.
A
few
leagues
farther
on,
Praed
pointed
out
more
graves,
a
whole
row
freshly
dug.
After
that,
a
day
hardly
passed
without
one.

One
time
Arya
woke
in
the
dark,
frightened
for
no
reason
she
could
name.
Above,
the
Red
Sword
shared
the
sky
with
half
a
thousand
stars.
The
night
seemed
oddly
quiet
to
her,
though
she
could
hear
YorenвЂ™s
muttered
snores,
the
crackle
of
the
fire,
even
the
muffled
stirrings
of
the
donkeys.
Yet
somehow
it
felt
as
though
the
world
were
holding
its
breath,
and
the
silence
made
her
shiver.
She
went
back
to
sleep
clutching
Needle.

Come
morning,
when
Praed
did
not
awaken,
Arya
realized
that
it
had
been
his
coughing
she
had
missed.
They
dug
a
grave
of
their
own
then,
burying
the
sellsword
where
heвЂ™d
slept.
Yoren
stripped
him
of
his
valuables
before
they
threw
the
dirt
on
him.
One
man
claimed
his
boots,
another
his
dagger.
His
mail
shirt
and
helm
were
parceled
out.
His
longsword
Yoren
handed
to
the
Bull.
вЂњArms
like
yours,
might
be
you
can
learn
to
use
this,вЂќ
he
told
him.
A
boy
called
Tarber
tossed
a
handful
of
acorns
on
top
of
PraedвЂ™s
body,
so
an
oak
might
grow
to
mark
his
place.

That
evening
they
stopped
in
a
village
at
an
ivy-covered
inn.
Yoren
counted
the
coins
in
his
purse
and
decided
they
had
enough
for
a
hot
meal.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
sleep
outside,
same
as
ever,
but
they
got
a
bathhouse
here,
if
any
of
you
feels
the
need
oвЂ™
hot
water
and
a
lick
oвЂ™
soap.вЂќ

Arya
did
not
dare,
even
though
she
smelled
as
bad
as
Yoren
by
now,
all
sour
and
stinky.
Some
of
the
creatures
living
in
her
clothes
had
come
all
the
way
from
Flea
Bottom
with
her;
it
didnвЂ™t
seem
right
to
drown
them.
Tarber
and
Hot
Pie
and
the
Bull
joined
the
line
of
men
headed
for
the
tubs.
Others
settled
down
in
front
of
the
bathhouse.
The
rest
crowded
into
the
common
room.
Yoren
even
sent
Lommy
out
with
tankards
for
the
three
in
fetters,
whoвЂ™d
been
left
chained
up
in
the
back
of
their
wagon.

Washed
and
unwashed
alike
supped
on
hot
pork
pies
and
baked
apples.
The
innkeeper
gave
them
a
round
of
beer
on
the
house.
вЂњI
had
a
brother
took
the
black,
years
ago.
Serving
boy,
clever,
but
one
day
he
got
seen
filching
pepper
from
mвЂ™lordвЂ™s
table.
He
liked
the
taste
of
it,
is
all.
just
a
pinch
oвЂ™
pepper,
but
Ser
Malcolm
was
a
hard
man.
You
get
pepper
on
the
Wall?вЂќ
When
Yoren
shook
his
head,
the
man
sighed.
вЂњShame.
Lync
loved
that
pepper.вЂќ

Arya
sipped
at
her
tankard
cautiously,
between
spoonfuls
of
pie
still
warm
from
the
oven.
Her
father
sometimes
let
them
have
a
cup
of
beer,
she
remembered.
Sansa
used
to
make
a
face
at
the
taste
and
say
that
wine
was
ever
so
much
finer,
but
Arya
had
liked
it
well
enough.
it
made
her
sad
to
think
of
Sansa
and
her
father.

The
inn
was
full
of
people
moving
south,
and
the
common
room
erupted
in
scorn
when
Yoren
said
they
were
traveling
the
other
way.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
be
back
soon
enough,вЂќ
the
innkeeper
vowed.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
no
going
north.
Half
the
fields
are
burnt,
and
what
folks
are
left
are
walled
up
inside
their
holdfasts.
One
bunch
rides
off
at
dawn
and
another
one
shows
up
by
dusk.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
nothing
to
us,вЂќ
Yoren
insisted
stubbornly.
вЂњTully
or
Lannister,
makes
no
matter.
The
Watch
takes
no
part.вЂќ

Lord
Tully
is
my
grandfather,
Arya
thought.
It
mattered
to
her,
but
she
chewed
her
lip
and
kept
quiet,
listening.

вЂњItвЂ™s
more
than
Lannister
and
Tully,вЂќ
the
innkeeper
said.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
wild
men
down
from
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
try
telling
them
you
take
no
part.
And
the
Starks
are
in
it
too,
the
young
lordвЂ™s
come
down,
the
dead
HandвЂ™s
sonвЂ¦вЂќ

Arya
sat
up
straight,
straining
to
hear.
Did
he
mean
Robb?

вЂњI
heard
the
boy
rides
to
battle
on
a
wolf,вЂќ
said
a
yellow-haired
man
with
a
tankard
in
his
hand.

вЂњFoolвЂ™s
talk.вЂќ
Yoren
spat.

вЂњThe
man
I
heard
it
from,
he
saw
it
himself.
A
wolf
big
as
a
horse,
he
swore.вЂќ

вЂњSwearing
donвЂ™t
make
it
true,
Hod,вЂќ
the
innkeeper
said.
вЂњYou
keep
swearing
youвЂ™ll
pay
what
you
owe
me,
and
IвЂ™ve
yet
to
see
a
copper.вЂќ
The
common
room
erupted
in
laughter,
and
the
man
with
the
yellow
hair
turned
red.

вЂњItвЂ™s
been
a
bad
year
for
wolves,вЂќ
volunteered
a
sallow
man
in
a
travel-stained
green
cloak.
вЂњAround
the
Gods
Eye,
the
packs
have
grown
bolderвЂ™n
anyone
can
remember.
Sheep,
cows,
dogs,
makes
no
matter,
they
kill
as
they
like,
and
they
got
no
fear
of
men.
ItвЂ™s
worth
your
life
to
go
into
those
woods
by
night.вЂќ

вЂњAh,
thatвЂ™s
more
tales,
and
no
more
true
than
the
other.вЂќ

вЂњI
heard
the
same
thing
from
my
cousin,
and
sheвЂ™s
not
the
sort
to
lie,вЂќ
an
old
woman
said.
вЂњShe
says
thereвЂ™s
this
great
pack,
hundreds
of
them,
mankillers.
The
one
that
leads
them
is
a
she-wolf,
a
bitch
from
the
seventh
hell.вЂќ

A
she-wolf.
Arya
sloshed
her
beer,
wondering.
Was
the
Gods
Eye
near
the
Trident?
She
wished
she
had
a
map.
It
had
been
near
the
Trident
that
sheвЂ™d
left
Nymeria.
She
hadnвЂ™t
wanted
to,
but
Jory
said
they
had
no
choice,
that
if
the
wolf
came
back
with
them
sheвЂ™d
be
killed
for
biting
Joffrey,
even
though
heвЂ™d
deserved
it.
TheyвЂ™d
had
to
shout
and
scream
and
throw
stones,
and
it
wasnвЂ™t
until
a
few
of
AryaвЂ™s
stones
struck
home
that
the
direwolf
had
finally
stopped
following
them.
She
probably
wouldnвЂ™t
even
know
me
now,
Arya
thought.
Or
if
she
did,
sheвЂ™d
hate
me.

The
man
in
the
green
cloak
said,
вЂњI
heard
how
this
hellbitch
walked
into
a
village
one
dayвЂ¦
a
market
day,
people
everywhere,
and
she
walks
in
bold
as
you
please
and
tears
a
baby
from
his
motherвЂ™s
arms.
When
the
tale
reached
Lord
Mooton,
him
and
his
sons
swore
theyвЂ™d
put
an
end
to
her.
They
tracked
her
to
her
lair
with
a
pack
of
wolfhounds,
and
barely
escaped
with
their
skins.
Not
one
of
those
dogs
came
back,
not
one.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
just
a
story,вЂќ
Arya
blurted
out
before
she
could
stop
herself.
вЂњWolves
donвЂ™t
eat
babies.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
would
you
know
about
it,
lad?вЂќ
asked
the
man
in
the
green
cloak.

Before
she
could
think
of
an
answer,
Yoren
had
her
by
the
arm.
вЂњThe
boyвЂ™s
greensick
on
beer,
thatвЂ™s
all
it
is.вЂќ

вЂњNo
IвЂ™m
not.
They
donвЂ™t
eat
babiesвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOutside,
boyвЂ¦
and
see
that
you
stay
there
until
you
learn
to
shut
your
mouth
when
men
are
talking.вЂќ
He
gave
her
a
stiff
shove,
toward
the
side
door
that
led
back
to
the
stables.
вЂњGo
on
now.
See
that
the
stableboy
has
watered
our
horses.вЂќ

Arya
went
outside,
stiff
with
fury.
вЂњThey
donвЂ™t,вЂќ
she
muttered,
kicking
at
a
rock
as
she
stalked
off.
It
went
rolling
and
fetched
up
under
the
wagons.

вЂњBoy,вЂќ
a
friendly
voice
called
out.
вЂњLovely
boy.вЂќ

One
of
the
men
in
irons
was
talking
to
her.
Warily,
Arya
approached
the
wagon,
one
hand
on
NeedleвЂ™s
hilt.

The
prisoner
lifted
an
empty
tankard,
his
chains
rattling.
вЂњA
man
could
use
another
taste
of
beer.
A
man
has
a
thirst,
wearing
these
heavy
bracelets.вЂќ
He
was
the
youngest
of
the
three,
slender,
fine-featured,
always
smiling.
His
hair
was
red
on
one
side
and
white
on
the
other,
all
matted
and
filthy
from
cage
and
travel.
вЂњA
man
could
use
a
bath
too,вЂќ
he
said,
when
he
saw
the
way
Arya
was
looking
at
him.
вЂњA
boy
could
make
a
friend.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
friends,вЂќ
Arya
said.

вЂњNone
I
can
see,вЂќ
said
the
one
without
a
nose.
He
was
squat
and
thick,
with
huge
hands.
Black
hair
covered
his
arms
and
legs
and
chest,
even
his
back.
He
reminded
Arya
of
a
drawing
she
had
once
seen
in
a
book,
of
an
ape
from
the
Summer
Isles.
The
hole
in
his
face
made
it
hard
to
look
at
him
for
long.

The
bald
one
opened
his
mouth
and
hissed
like
some
immense
white
lizard.
When
Arya
flinched
back,
startled,
he
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
waggled
his
tongue
at
her,
only
it
was
more
a
stump
than
a
tongue.
вЂњStop
that,вЂќ
she
blurted.

вЂњA
man
does
not
choose
his
companions
in
the
black
cells,вЂќ
the
handsome
one
with
the
red-and-white
hair
said.
Something
about
the
way
he
talked
reminded
her
of
Syrio;
it
was
the
same,
yet
different
too.
вЂњThese
two,
they
have
no
courtesy.
A
man
must
ask
forgiveness.
You
are
called
Arry,
is
that
not
so?вЂќ

вЂњLumpyhead,вЂќ
said
the
noseless
one.
вЂњLumpyhead
Lumpyface
Stickboy.
Have
a
care,
Lorath,
heвЂ™ll
hit
you
with
his
stick.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
must
be
ashamed
of
the
company
he
keeps,
Arry,вЂќ
the
handsome
one
said.
вЂњThis
man
has
the
honor
to
be
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
once
of
the
Free
City
of
Lorath.
Would
that
he
were
home.
This
manвЂ™s
ill-bred
companions
in
captivity
are
named
RorgeвЂќвЂ”he
waved
his
tankard
at
the
noseless
manвЂ”вЂњand
Biter.вЂќ
Biter
hissed
at
her
again,
displaying
a
mouthful
of
yellowed
teeth
filed
into
points.
вЂњA
man
must
have
some
name,
is
that
not
so?
Biter
cannot
speak
and
Biter
cannot
write,
yet
his
teeth
are
very
sharp,
so
a
man
calls
him
Biter
and
he
smiles.
Are
you
charmed?вЂќ

Arya
backed
away
from
the
wagon.
вЂњNo.вЂќ
They
canвЂ™t
hurt
me,
she
told
herself,
theyвЂ™re
all
chained
up.

He
turned
his
tankard
upside
down.
вЂњA
man
must
weep.вЂќ

Rorge,
the
noseless
one,
flung
his
drinking
cup
at
her
with
a
curse.
His
manacles
made
him
clumsy,
yet
even
so
he
would
have
sent
the
heavy
pewter
tankard
crashing
into
her
head
if
Arya
hadnвЂ™t
leapt
aside.
вЂњYou
get
us
some
beer,
pimple.
Now!вЂќ

вЂњYou
shut
your
mouth!вЂќ
Arya
tried
to
think
what
Syrio
would
have
done.
She
drew
her
wooden
practice
sword.

вЂњCome
closer,вЂќ
Rorge
said,
вЂњand
IвЂ™ll
shove
that
stick
up
your
bunghole
and
fuck
you
bloody.вЂќ

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Arya
made
herself
approach
the
wagon.
Every
step
was
harder
than
the
one
before.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine,
calm
as
still
water.
The
words
sang
in
her
head.
Syrio
would
not
have
been
afraid.
She
was
almost
close
enough
to
touch
the
wheel
when
Biter
lurched
to
his
feet
and
grabbed
for
her,
his
irons
clanking
and
rattling.
The
manacles
brought
his
hands
up
short,
half
a
foot
from
her
face.
He
hissed.

She
hit
him.
Hard,
right
between
his
little
eyes.

Screaming,
Biter
reeled
back,
and
then
threw
all
his
weight
against
his
chains.
The
links
slithered
and
turned
and
grew
taut,
and
Arya
heard
the
creak
of
old
dry
wood
as
the
great
iron
rings
strained
against
the
floorboards
of
the
wagon.
Huge
pale
hands
groped
for
her
while
veins
bulged
along
BiterвЂ™s
arms,
but
the
bonds
held,
and
finally
the
man
collapsed
backward.
Blood
ran
from
the
weeping
sores
on
his
cheeks.

вЂњA
boy
has
more
courage
than
sense,вЂќ
the
one
who
had
named
himself
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
observed.

Arya
edged
backward
away
from
the
wagon.
When
she
felt
the
hand
on
her
shoulder,
she
whirled,
bringing
up
her
stick
sword
again,
but
it
was
only
the
Bull.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing?вЂќ

He
raised
his
hands
defensively.
вЂњYoren
said
none
of
us
should
go
near
those
three.вЂќ

вЂњThey
donвЂ™t
scare
me,вЂќ
Arya
said.

вЂњThen
youвЂ™re
stupid.
They
scare
me.вЂќ
The
BullвЂ™s
hand
fell
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword,
and
Rorge
began
to
laugh.
вЂњLetвЂ™s
get
away
from
them.вЂќ

Arya
scuffed
at
the
ground
with
her
foot,
but
she
let
the
Bull
lead
her
around
to
the
front
of
the
inn.
RorgeвЂ™s
laughter
and
BiterвЂ™s
hissing
followed
them.
вЂњWant
to
fight?вЂќ
she
asked
the
Bull.
She
wanted
to
hit
something.

He
blinked
at
her,
startled.
Strands
of
thick
black
hair,
still
wet
from
the
bathhouse,
fell
across
his
deep
blue
eyes.
вЂњIвЂ™d
hurt
you.вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
not.вЂќ

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
know
how
strong
I
am.вЂќ

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
know
how
quick
I
am.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
asking
for
it,
Arry.вЂќ
He
drew
PraedвЂ™s
longsword.
вЂњThis
is
cheap
steel,
but
itвЂ™s
a
real
sword.вЂќ

Arya
unsheathed
Needle.
вЂњThis
is
good
steel,
so
itвЂ™s
realer
than
yours.вЂќ

The
Bull
shook
his
head.
вЂњPromise
not
to
cry
if
I
cut
you?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
promise
if
you
will.вЂќ
She
turned
sideways,
into
her
water
dancerвЂ™s
stance,
but
the
Bull
did
not
move.
He
was
looking
at
something
behind
her.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
wrong?вЂќ

вЂњGold
cloaks.вЂќ
His
face
closed
up
tight.

It
couldnвЂ™t
be,
Arya
thought,
but
when
she
glanced
back,
they
were
riding
up
the
kingsroad,
six
in
the
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch.
One
was
an
officer;
he
wore
a
black
enamel
breastplate
ornamented
with
four
golden
disks.
They
drew
up
in
front
of
the
inn.
Look
with
your
eyes,
SyrioвЂ™s
voice
seemed
to
whisper.
Her
eyes
saw
white
lather
under
their
saddles;
the
horses
had
been
ridden
long
and
hard.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
took
the
Bull
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
back
behind
a
tall
flowering
hedge.

вЂњWhat
is
it?вЂќ
he
asked.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing?
Let
go.вЂќ

вЂњQuiet
as
a
shadow,вЂќ
she
whispered,
pulling
him
down.

Some
of
YorenвЂ™s
other
charges
were
sitting
in
front
of
the
bathhouse,
waiting
their
turn
at
a
tub.
вЂњYou
men,вЂќ
one
of
the
gold
cloaks
shouted.
вЂњYou
the
ones
left
to
take
the
black?вЂќ

вЂњWe
might
be,вЂќ
came
the
cautious
answer.

вЂњWeвЂ™d
rather
join
you
boys,вЂќ
old
Reysen
said.
вЂњWe
hear
itвЂ™s
cold
on
that
Wall.вЂќ

The
gold
cloak
officer
dismounted.
вЂњI
have
a
warrant
for
a
certain
boyвЂ”вЂќ

Yoren
stepped
out
of
the
inn,
fingering
his
tangled
black
beard.
вЂњWho
is
it
wants
this
boy?вЂќ

The
other
gold
cloaks
were
dismounting
to
stand
beside
their
horses.
вЂњWhy
are
we
hiding?вЂќ
the
Bull
whispered.

вЂњItвЂ™s
me
they
want,вЂќ
Arya
whispered
back.
His
ear
smelled
of
soap.
вЂњYou
be
quiet.вЂќ

вЂњThe
queen
wants
him,
old
man,
not
that
itвЂ™s
your
concern,вЂќ
the
officer
said,
drawing
a
ribbon
from
his
belt.
вЂњHere,
Her
GraceвЂ™s
seal
and
warrant.вЂќ

Behind
the
hedge,
the
Bull
shook
his
head
doubtfully.
вЂњWhy
would
the
queen
want
you,
Arry?вЂќ

She
punched
his
shoulder.
вЂњBe
quiet!вЂќ

Yoren
fingered
the
warrant
ribbon
with
its
blob
of
golden
wax.
вЂњPretty.вЂќ
He
spit.
вЂњThing
is,
the
boyвЂ™s
in
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
now.
What
he
done
back
in
the
city
donвЂ™t
mean
piss-all.вЂќ

вЂњThe
queenвЂ™s
not
interested
in
your
views,
old
man,
and
neither
am
I,вЂќ
the
officer
said.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
the
boy.вЂќ

Arya
thought
about
running,
but
she
knew
she
wouldnвЂ™t
get
far
on
her
donkey
when
the
gold
cloaks
had
horses.
And
she
was
so
tired
of
running.
SheвЂ™d
run
when
Ser
Meryn
came
for
her,
and
again
when
they
killed
her
father.
If
she
was
a
real
water
dancer,
she
would
go
out
there
with
Needle
and
kill
all
of
them,
and
never
run
from
anyone
ever
again.

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
have
no
one,вЂќ
Yoren
said
stubbornly.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
laws
on
such
things.вЂќ

The
gold
cloak
drew
a
shortsword.
вЂњHereвЂ™s
your
law.вЂќ

Yoren
looked
at
the
blade.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
no
law,
just
a
sword.
Happens
I
got
one
too.вЂќ

The
officer
smiled.
вЂњOld
fool.
I
have
five
men
with
me.вЂќ

Yoren
spat.
вЂњHappens
I
got
thirty.вЂќ

The
gold
cloak
laughed.
вЂњThis
lot?вЂќ
said
a
big
lout
with
a
broken
nose.
вЂњWhoвЂ™s
first?вЂќ
he
shouted,
showing
his
steel.

Tarber
plucked
a
pitchfork
out
of
a
bale
of
hay.
вЂњI
am.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
I
am,вЂќ
called
Cutjack,
the
plump
stonemason,
pulling
his
hammer
off
the
leather
apron
he
always
wore.

вЂњMe.вЂќ
Kurz
came
up
off
the
ground
with
his
skinning
knife
in
hand.

вЂњMe
and
him.вЂќ
Koss
strung
his
longbow.

вЂњAll
of
us,вЂќ
said
Reysen,
snatching
up
the
tall
hardwood
walking
staff
he
carried.

Dobber
stepped
naked
out
of
the
bathhouse
with
his
clothes
in
a
bundle,
saw
what
was
happening,
and
dropped
everything
but
his
dagger.
вЂњIs
it
a
fight?вЂќ
he
asked.

вЂњI
guess,вЂќ
said
Hot
Pie,
scrambling
on
all
fours
for
a
big
rock
to
throw.
Arya
could
not
believe
what
she
was
seeing.
She
hated
Hot
Pie!
Why
would
he
risk
himself
for
her?

The
one
with
the
broken
nose
still
thought
it
was
funny.
вЂњYou
girls
put
away
them
rocks
and
sticks
before
you
get
spanked.
None
of
you
knows
what
end
of
a
sword
to
hold.вЂќ

вЂњI
do!вЂќ
Arya
wouldnвЂ™t
let
them
die
for
her
like
Syrio.
She
wouldnвЂ™t!
Shoving
through
the
hedge
with
Needle
in
hand,
she
slid
into
a
water
dancerвЂ™s
stance.

Broken
Nose
guffawed.
The
officer
looked
her
up
and
down.
вЂњPut
the
blade
away,
little
girl,
no
one
wants
to
hurt
you.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
not
a
girl!вЂќ
she
yelled,
furious.
What
was
wrong
with
them?
They
rode
all
this
way
for
her
and
here
she
was
and
they
were
just
smiling
at
her.
вЂњIвЂ™m
the
one
you
want.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
the
one
we
want.вЂќ
The
officer
jabbed
his
shortsword
toward
the
Bull,
whoвЂ™d
come
forward
to
stand
beside
her,
PraedвЂ™s
cheap
steel
in
his
hand.

But
it
was
a
mistake
to
take
his
eyes
off
Yoren,
even
for
an
instant.
Quick
as
that,
the
black
brotherвЂ™s
sword
was
pressed
to
the
apple
of
the
officerвЂ™s
throat.
вЂњNeitherвЂ™s
the
one
you
get,
less
you
want
me
to
see
if
your
appleвЂ™s
ripe
yet.
I
got
me
ten,
fifteen
more
brothers
in
that
inn,
if
you
still
need
convincing.
I
was
you,
IвЂ™d
let
loose
of
that
gutcutter,
spread
my
cheeks
over
that
fat
little
horse,
and
gallop
on
back
to
the
city.вЂќ
He
spat,
and
poked
harder
with
the
point
of
his
sword.
вЂњNow.вЂќ

The
officerвЂ™s
fingers
uncurled.
His
sword
fell
in
the
dust.

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
just
keep
that,вЂќ
Yoren
said.
вЂњGood
steelвЂ™s
always
needed
on
the
Wall.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.
For
now.
Men.вЂќ
The
gold
cloaks
sheathed
and
mounted
up.
вЂњYouвЂ™d
best
scamper
up
to
that
Wall
of
yours
in
a
hurry,
old
man.
The
next
time
I
catch
you,
I
believe
IвЂ™ll
have
your
head
to
go
with
the
bastard
boyвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњBetter
men
than
you
have
tried.вЂќ
Yoren
slapped
the
rump
of
the
officerвЂ™s
horse
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
sent
him
reeling
off
down
the
kingsroad.
His
men
followed.

When
they
were
out
of
sight,
Hot
Pie
began
to
whoop,
but
Yoren
looked
angrier
than
ever.
вЂњFool!
You
think
heвЂ™s
done
with
us?
Next
time
he
wonвЂ™t
prance
up
and
hand
me
no
damn
ribbon.
Get
the
rest
out
oвЂ™
them
baths,
we
need
to
be
moving.
Ride
all
night,
maybe
we
can
stay
ahead
oвЂ™
them
for
a
bit.вЂќ
He
scooped
up
the
shortsword
the
officer
had
dropped.
вЂњWho
wants
this?вЂќ

вЂњMe!вЂќ
Hot
Pie
yelled.

вЂњDonвЂ™t
be
using
it
on
Arry.вЂќ
He
handed
the
boy
the
sword,
hilt
first,
and
walked
over
to
Arya,
but
it
was
the
Bull
he
spoke
to.
вЂњQueen
wants
you
bad,
boy.вЂќ

Arya
was
lost.
вЂњWhy
should
she
want
him?вЂќ

The
Bull
scowled
at
her.
вЂњWhy
should
she
want
you?
YouвЂ™re
nothing
but
a
little
gutter
rat!вЂќ

вЂњWell,
youвЂ™re
nothing
but
a
bastard
boy!вЂќ
Or
maybe
he
was
only
pretending
to
be
a
bastard
boy.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
your
true
name?вЂќ

вЂњGendry,вЂќ
he
said,
like
he
wasnвЂ™t
quite
sure.

вЂњDonвЂ™t
see
why
no
one
wants
neither
oвЂ™
you,вЂќ
Yoren
said,
вЂњbut
they
canвЂ™t
have
you
regardless.
You
ride
them
two
coursers.
First
sight
of
a
gold
cloak,
make
for
the
Wall
like
a
dragonвЂ™s
on
your
tail.
The
rest
oвЂ™
us
donвЂ™t
mean
spit
to
them.вЂќ

вЂњExcept
for
you,вЂќ
Arya
pointed
out.
вЂњThat
man
said
heвЂ™d
take
your
head
too.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
as
to
that,вЂќ
Yoren
said,
вЂњif
he
can
get
it
off
my
shoulders,
heвЂ™s
welcome
to
it.вЂќ





JON

вЂњSam?вЂќ
Jon
called
softly.

The
air
smelled
of
paper
and
dust
and
years.
Before
him,
tall
wooden
shelves
rose
up
into
dimness,
crammed
with
leatherbound
books
and
bins
of
ancient
scrolls.
A
faint
yellow
glow
filtered
through
the
stacks
from
some
hidden
lamp.
Jon
blew
out
the
taper
he
carried,
preferring
not
to
risk
an
open
flame
amidst
so
much
old
dry
paper.
Instead
he
followed
the
light,
wending
his
way
down
the
narrow
aisles
beneath
barrel-vaulted
ceilings.
All
in
black,
he
was
a
shadow
among
shadows,
dark
of
hair,
long
of
face,
grey
of
eye.
Black
moleskin
gloves
covered
his
hands;
the
right
because
it
was
burned,
the
left
because
a
man
felt
half
a
fool
wearing
only
one
glove.

Samwell
Tarly
sat
hunched
over
a
table
in
a
niche
carved
into
the
stone
of
the
wall.
The
glow
came
from
the
lamp
hung
over
his
head.
He
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
JonвЂ™s
steps.

вЂњHave
you
been
here
all
night?вЂќ

вЂњHave
I?вЂќ
Sam
looked
startled.

вЂњYou
didnвЂ™t
break
your
fast
with
us,
and
your
bed
hadnвЂ™t
been
slept
in.вЂќ
Rast
suggested
that
maybe
Sam
had
deserted,
but
Jon
never
believed
it.
Desertion
required
its
own
sort
of
courage,
and
Sam
had
little
enough
of
that.

вЂњIs
it
morning?
Down
here
thereвЂ™s
no
way
to
know.вЂќ

вЂњSam,
youвЂ™re
a
sweet
fool,вЂќ
Jon
said.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
miss
that
bed
when
weвЂ™re
sleeping
on
the
cold
hard
ground,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

Sam
yawned.
вЂњMaester
Aemon
sent
me
to
find
maps
for
the
Lord
Commander.
I
never
thoughtвЂ¦
Jon,
the
books,
have
you
ever
seen
their
like?
There
are
thousands!вЂќ

He
gazed
about
him.
вЂњThe
library
at
Winterfell
has
more
than
a
hundred.
Did
you
find
the
maps?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
yes.вЂќ
SamвЂ™s
hand
swept
over
the
table,
fingers
plump
as
sausages
indicating
the
clutter
of
books
and
scrolls
before
him.
вЂњA
dozen,
at
the
least.вЂќ
He
unfolded
a
square
of
parchment.
вЂњThe
paint
has
faded,
but
you
can
see
where
the
mapmaker
marked
the
sites
of
wildling
villages,
and
thereвЂ™s
another
bookвЂ¦
where
is
it
now?
I
was
reading
it
a
moment
ago.вЂќ
He
shoved
some
scrolls
aside
to
reveal
a
dusty
volume
bound
in
rotted
leather.
вЂњThis,вЂќ
he
said
reverently,
вЂњis
the
account
of
a
journey
from
the
Shadow
Tower
all
the
way
to
Lorn
Point
on
the
Frozen
Shore,
written
by
a
ranger
named
Redwyn.
ItвЂ™s
not
dated,
but
he
mentions
a
Dorren
Stark
as
King
in
the
North,
so
it
must
be
from
before
the
Conquest.
Jon,
they
fought
giants!
Redwyn
even
traded
with
the
children
of
the
forest,
itвЂ™s
all
here.вЂќ
Ever
so
delicately,
he
turned
pages
with
a
finger.
вЂњHe
drew
maps
as
well,
seeвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњMaybe
you
could
write
an
account
of
our
ranging,
Sam.вЂќ

HeвЂ™d
meant
to
sound
encouraging,
but
it
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say.
The
last
thing
Sam
needed
was
to
be
reminded
of
what
faced
them
on
the
morrow.
He
shuffled
the
scrolls
about
aimlessly.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
more
maps.
If
I
had
time
to
searchвЂ¦
everythingвЂ™s
a
jumble.
I
could
set
it
all
to
order,
though;
I
know
I
could,
but
it
would
take
timeвЂ¦
well,
years,
in
truth.вЂќ

вЂњMormont
wanted
those
maps
a
little
sooner
than
that.вЂќ
Jon
plucked
a
scroll
from
a
bin,
blew
off
the
worst
of
the
dust.
A
corner
flaked
off
between
his
fingers
as
he
unrolled
it.
вЂњLook,
this
one
is
crumbling,вЂќ
he
said,
frowning
over
the
faded
script.

вЂњBe
gentle.вЂќ
Sam
came
around
the
table
and
took
the
scroll
from
his
hand,
holding
it
as
if
it
were
a
wounded
animal.
вЂњThe
important
books
used
to
be
copied
over
when
they
needed
them.
Some
of
the
oldest
have
been
copied
half
a
hundred
times,
probably.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
donвЂ™t
bother
copying
that
one.
Twenty-three
barrels
of
pickled
cod,
eighteen
jars
of
fish
oil,
a
cask
of
saltвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAn
inventory,вЂќ
Sam
said,
вЂњor
perhaps
a
bill
of
sale.вЂќ

вЂњWho
cares
how
much
pickled
cod
they
ate
six
hundred
years
ago?вЂќ
Jon
wondered.

вЂњI
would.вЂќ
Sam
carefully
replaced
the
scroll
in
the
bin
from
which
Jon
had
plucked
it.
вЂњYou
can
learn
so
much
from
ledgers
like
that,
truly
you
can.
it
can
tell
you
how
many
men
were
in
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
then,
how
they
lived,
what
they
ateвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThey
ate
food,вЂќ
said
Jon,
вЂњand
they
lived
as
we
live.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
be
surprised.
This
vault
is
a
treasure,
Jon.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
say
so.вЂќ
Jon
was
doubtful.
Treasure
meant
gold,
silver,
and
jewels,
not
dust,
spiders,
and
rotting
leather.

вЂњI
do,вЂќ
the
fat
boy
blurted.
He
was
older
than
Jon,
a
man
grown
by
law,
but
it
was
hard
to
think
of
him
as
anything
but
a
boy.
вЂњI
found
drawings
of
the
faces
in
the
trees,
and
a
book
about
the
tongue
of
the
children
of
the
forestвЂ¦
works
that
even
the
Citadel
doesnвЂ™t
have,
scrolls
from
old
Valyria,
counts
of
the
seasons
written
by
maesters
dead
a
thousand
yearsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
books
will
still
be
here
when
we
return.вЂќ

вЂњIf
we
returnвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
Old
Bear
is
taking
two
hundred
seasoned
men,
three-quarters
of
them
rangers.
Qhorin
Halfhand
will
be
bringing
another
hundred
brothers
from
the
Shadow
Tower.
YouвЂ™ll
be
as
safe
as
if
you
were
back
in
your
lord
fatherвЂ™s
castle
at
Horn
Hill.вЂќ

Samwell
Tarly
managed
a
sad
little
smile.
вЂњI
was
never
very
safe
in
my
fatherвЂ™s
castle
either.вЂќ

The
gods
play
cruel
jests,
Jon
thought.
Pyp
and
Toad,
all
a
lather
to
be
a
part
of
the
great
ranging,
were
to
remain
at
Castle
Black.
It
was
Samwell
Tarly,
the
self-proclaimed
coward,
grossly
fat,
timid,
and
near
as
bad
a
rider
as
he
was
with
a
sword,
who
must
face
the
haunted
forest.
The
Old
Bear
was
taking
two
cages
of
ravens,
so
they
might
send
back
word
as
they
went.
Maester
Aemon
was
blind
and
far
too
frail
to
ride
with
them,
so
his
steward
must
go
in
his
place.
вЂњWe
need
you
for
the
ravens,
Sam.
And
someone
has
to
help
me
keep
Grenn
humble.вЂќ

SamвЂ™s
chins
quivered.
вЂњYou
could
care
for
the
ravens,
or
Grenn
could,
or
anyone,вЂќ
he
said
with
a
thin
edge
of
desperation
in
his
voice.
вЂњI
could
show
you
how.
You
know
your
letters
too,
you
could
write
down
Lord
MormontвЂ™s
messages
as
well
as
I.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
steward.
IвЂ™ll
need
to
squire
for
him,
tend
his
horse,
set
up
his
tent;
I
wonвЂ™t
have
time
to
watch
over
birds
as
well.
Sam,
you
said
the
words.
YouвЂ™re
a
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
now.вЂќ

вЂњA
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
shouldnвЂ™t
be
so
scared.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™re
all
scared.
WeвЂ™d
be
fools
if
we
werenвЂ™t.вЂќ
Too
many
rangers
had
been
lost
the
past
two
years,
even
Benjen
Stark,
JonвЂ™s
uncle.
They
had
found
two
of
his
uncleвЂ™s
men
in
the
wood,
slain,
but
the
corpses
had
risen
in
the
chill
of
night.
JonвЂ™s
burnt
fingers
twitched
as
he
remembered.
He
still
saw
the
wight
in
his
dreams,
dead
Othor
with
the
burning
blue
eyes
and
the
cold
black
hands,
but
that
was
the
last
thing
Sam
needed
to
be
reminded
of.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
no
shame
in
fear,
my
father
told
me,
what
matters
is
how
we
face
it.
Come,
IвЂ™ll
help
you
gather
up
the
maps.вЂќ

Sam
nodded
unhappily.
The
shelves
were
so
closely
spaced
that
they
had
to
walk
single
file
as
they
left.
The
vault
opened
onto
one
of
the
tunnels
the
brothers
called
the
wormwalks,
winding
subterranean
passages
that
linked
the
keeps
and
towers
of
Castle
Black
under
the
earth.
In
summer
the
wormwalks
were
seldom
used,
save
by
rats
and
other
vermin,
but
winter
was
a
different
matter.
When
the
snows
drifted
forty
and
fifty
feet
high
and
the
ice
winds
came
howling
out
of
the
north,
the
tunnels
were
all
that
held
Castle
Black
together.

Soon,
Jon
thought
as
they
climbed.
HeвЂ™d
seen
the
harbinger
that
had
come
to
Maester
Aemon
with
word
of
summerвЂ™s
end,
the
great
raven
of
the
Citadel,
white
and
silent
as
Ghost.
He
had
seen
a
winter
once,
when
he
was
very
young,
but
everyone
agreed
that
it
had
been
a
short
one,
and
mild.
This
one
would
be
different.
He
could
feel
it
in
his
bones.

The
steep
stone
steps
had
Sam
puffing
like
a
blacksmithвЂ™s
bellows
by
the
time
they
reached
the
surface.
They
emerged
into
a
brisk
wind
that
made
JonвЂ™s
cloak
swirl
and
snap.
Ghost
was
stretched
out
asleep
beneath
the
wattle-and-daub
wall
of
the
granary,
but
he
woke
when
Jon
appeared,
bushy
white
tail
held
stiffly
upright
as
he
trotted
to
them.

Sam
squinted
up
at
the
Wall.
It
loomed
above
them,
an
icy
cliff
seven
hundred
feet
high.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
Jon
almost
a
living
thing,
with
moods
of
its
own.
The
color
of
the
ice
was
wont
to
change
with
every
shift
of
the
light.
Now
it
was
the
deep
blue
of
frozen
rivers,
now
the
dirty
white
of
old
snow,
and
when
a
cloud
passed
before
the
sun
it
darkened
to
the
pale
grey
of
pitted
stone.
The
Wall
stretched
east
and
west
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see,
so
huge
that
it
shrunk
the
timbered
keeps
and
stone
towers
of
the
castle
to
insignificance.
It
was
the
end
of
the
world.

And
we
are
going
beyond
it.

The
morning
sky
was
streaked
by
thin
grey
clouds,
but
the
pale
red
line
was
there
behind
them.
The
black
brothers
had
dubbed
the
wanderer
MormontвЂ™s
Torch,
saying
(only
half
in
jest)
that
the
gods
must
have
sent
it
to
light
the
old
manвЂ™s
way
through
the
haunted
forest.

вЂњThe
cometвЂ™s
so
bright
you
can
see
it
by
day
now,вЂќ
Sam
said,
shading
his
eyes
with
a
fistful
of
books.

вЂњNever
mind
about
comets,
itвЂ™s
maps
the
Old
Bear
wants.вЂќ

Ghost
loped
ahead
of
them.
The
grounds
seemed
deserted
this
morning,
with
so
many
rangers
off
at
the
brothel
in
MoleвЂ™s
Town,
digging
for
buried
treasure
and
drinking
themselves
blind.
Grenn
had
gone
with
them.
Pyp
and
Halder
and
Toad
had
offered
to
buy
him
his
first
woman
to
celebrate
his
first
ranging.
TheyвЂ™d
wanted
Jon
and
Sam
to
come
as
well,
but
Sam
was
almost
as
frightened
of
whores
as
he
was
of
the
haunted
forest,
and
Jon
had
wanted
no
part
of
it.
вЂњDo
what
you
want,вЂќ
he
told
Toad,
вЂњI
took
a
vow.вЂќ

As
they
passed
the
sept,
he
heard
voices
raised
in
song.
Some
men
want
whores
on
the
eve
of
battle,
and
some
want
gods.
Jon
wondered
who
felt
better
afterward.
The
sept
tempted
him
no
more
than
the
brothel;
his
own
gods
kept
their
temples
in
the
wild
places,
where
the
weirwoods
spread
their
bone-white
branches.
The
Seven
have
no
power
beyond
the
Wall,
he
thought,
but
my
gods
will
be
waiting.

Outside
the
armory,
Ser
Endrew
Tarth
was
working
with
some
raw
recruits.
TheyвЂ™d
come
in
last
night
with
Conwy,
one
of
the
wandering
crows
who
roamed
the
Seven
Kingdoms
collecting
men
for
the
Wall.
This
new
crop
consisted
of
a
greybeard
leaning
on
a
staff,
two
blond
boys
with
the
look
of
brothers,
a
foppish
youth
in
soiled
satin,
a
raggy
man
with
a
clubfoot,
and
some
grinning
loon
who
must
have
fancied
himself
a
warrior.
Ser
Endrew
was
showing
him
the
error
of
that
presumption.
He
was
a
gentler
master-at-arms
than
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
had
been,
but
his
lessons
would
still
raise
bruises.
Sam
winced
at
every
blow,
but
Jon
Snow
watched
the
swordplay
closely.

вЂњWhat
do
you
make
of
them,
Snow?вЂќ
Donal
Noye
stood
in
the
door
of
his
armory,
bare-chested
under
a
leather
apron,
the
stump
of
his
left
arm
uncovered
for
once.
With
his
big
gut
and
barrel
chest,
his
flat
nose
and
bristly
black
jaw,
Noyc
did
not
make
a
pretty
sight,
but
he
was
a
welcome
one
nonetheless.
The
armorer
had
proved
himself
a
good
friend.

вЂњThey
smell
of
summer,вЂќ
Jon
said
as
Ser
Endrew
bullrushed
his
foe
and
knocked
him
sprawling.
вЂњWhere
did
Conwy
find
them?вЂќ

вЂњA
lordвЂ™s
dungeon
near
Gulltown,вЂќ
the
smith
replied.
вЂњA
brigand,
a
barber,
a
beggar,
two
orphans,
and
a
boy
whore.
With
such
do
we
defend
the
realms
of
men.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
do.вЂќ
Jon
gave
Sam
a
private
smile.
вЂњWe
did.вЂќ

Noye
drew
him
closer.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
heard
these
tidings
of
your
brother?вЂќ

вЂњLast
night.вЂќ
Conwy
and
his
charges
had
brought
the
news
north
with
them,
and
the
talk
in
the
common
room
had
been
of
little
else.
Jon
was
still
not
certain
how
he
felt
about
it.
Robb
a
king?
The
brother
heвЂ™d
played
with,
fought
with,
shared
his
first
cup
of
wine
with?
But
not
motherвЂ™s
milk,
no.
So
now
Robb
will
sip
summerwine
from
jeweled
goblets,
while
IвЂ™m
kneeling
beside
some
stream
sucking
snowmelt
from
cupped
hands.
вЂњRobb
will
make
a
good
king,вЂќ
he
said
loyally.

вЂњWill
he
now?вЂќ
The
smith
eyed
him
frankly.
вЂњI
hope
thatвЂ™s
so,
boy,
but
once
I
might
have
said
the
same
of
Robert.вЂќ

вЂњThey
say
you
forged
his
warhammer,вЂќ
Jon
remembered.

вЂњAye.
I
was
his
man,
a
Baratheon
man,
smith
and
armorer
at
StormвЂ™s
End
until
I
lost
the
arm.
IвЂ™m
old
enough
to
remember
Lord
Steffon
before
the
sea
took
him,
and
I
knew
those
three
sons
of
his
since
they
got
their
names.
I
tell
you
thisвЂ”Robert
was
never
the
same
after
he
put
on
that
crown.
Some
men
are
like
swords,
made
for
fighting.
Hang
them
up
and
they
go
to
rust.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
his
brothers?вЂќ
Jon
asked.

The
armorer
considered
that
a
moment.
вЂњRobert
was
the
true
steel.
Stannis
is
pure
iron,
black
and
hard
and
strong,
yes,
but
brittle,
the
way
iron
gets.
HeвЂ™ll
break
before
he
bends.
And
Renly,
that
one,
heвЂ™s
copper,
bright
and
shiny,
pretty
to
look
at
but
not
worth
all
that
much
at
the
end
of
the
day.вЂќ

And
what
metal
is
Robb?
Jon
did
not
ask.
Noye
was
a
Baratheon
man;
likely
he
thought
Joffrey
the
lawful
king
and
Robb
a
traitor.
Among
the
brotherhood
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch,
there
was
an
unspoken
pact
never
to
probe
too
deeply
into
such
matters.
Men
came
to
the
Wall
from
all
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
old
loves
and
loyalties
were
not
easily
forgotten,
no
matter
how
many
oaths
a
man
sworeвЂ¦
as
Jon
himself
had
good
reason
to
know.
Even
SamвЂ”his
fatherвЂ™s
House
was
sworn
to
Highgarden,
whose
Lord
Tyrell
supported
King
Renly.
Best
not
to
talk
of
such
things.
The
NightвЂ™s
Watch
took
no
sides.
вЂњLord
Mormont
awaits
us,вЂќ
Jon
said.

вЂњI
wonвЂ™t
keep
you
from
the
Old
Bear.вЂќ
Noye
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
smiled.
вЂњMay
the
gods
go
with
you
on
the
morrow,
Snow.
You
bring
back
that
uncle
of
yours,
you
hear?вЂќ

вЂњWe
will,вЂќ
Jon
promised
him.

Lord
Commander
Mormont
had
taken
up
residence
in
the
KingвЂ™s
Tower
after
the
fire
had
gutted
his
own.
Jon
left
Ghost
with
the
guards
outside
the
door.
вЂњMore
stairs,вЂќ
said
Sam
miserably
as
they
started
up.
вЂњI
hate
stairs.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
thatвЂ™s
one
thing
we
wonвЂ™t
face
in
the
wood.вЂќ

When
they
entered
the
solar,
the
raven
spied
them
at
once.
вЂњSnow!вЂќ
the
bird
shrieked.
Mormont
broke
off
his
conversation.
вЂњTook
you
long
enough
with
those
maps.вЂќ
He
pushed
the
remains
of
breakfast
out
of
the
way
to
make
room
on
the
table.
вЂњPut
them
here.
IвЂ™ll
have
a
look
at
them
later.вЂќ

Thoren
Smallwood,
a
sinewy
ranger
with
a
weak
chin
and
a
weaker
mouth
hidden
under
a
thin
scraggle
of
beard,
gave
Jon
and
Sam
a
cool
look.
He
had
been
one
of
Alliser
ThorneвЂ™s
henchmen,
and
had
no
love
for
either
of
them.
вЂњThe
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
place
is
at
Castle
Black,
lording
and
commanding,вЂќ
he
told
Mormont,
ignoring
the
newcomers,
вЂњit
seems
to
me.вЂќ

The
raven
flapped
big
black
wings.
вЂњMe,
me,
me.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
are
ever
Lord
Commander,
you
may
do
as
you
please,вЂќ
Mormont
told
the
ranger,
вЂњbut
it
seems
to
me
that
I
have
not
died
yet,
nor
have
the
brothers
put
you
in
my
place.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
First
Ranger
now,
with
Ben
Stark
lost
and
Ser
Jaremy
killed,вЂќ
Smallwood
said
stubbornly.
вЂњThe
command
should
be
mine.вЂќ

Mormont
would
have
none
of
it.
вЂњI
sent
out
Ben
Stark,
and
Ser
Waymar
before
him.
I
do
not
mean
to
send
you
after
them
and
sit
wondering
how
long
I
must
wait
before
I
give
you
up
for
lost
as
well.вЂќ
He
pointed.
вЂњAnd
Stark
remains
First
Ranger
until
we
know
for
a
certainty
that
he
is
dead.
Should
that
day
come,
it
will
be
me
who
names
his
successor,
not
you.
Now
stop
wasting
my
time.
We
ride
at
first
light,
or
have
you
forgotten?вЂќ

Smallwood
pushed
to
his
feet.
вЂњAs
my
lord
commands.вЂќ
On
the
way
out,
he
frowned
at
Jon,
as
if
it
were
somehow
his
fault.

вЂњFirst
Ranger!вЂќ
The
Old
BearвЂ™s
eyes
lighted
on
Sam.
вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
name
you
First
Ranger.
He
has
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
IвЂ™m
too
old
to
ride
with
him.
Do
I
look
old
to
you,
boy?вЂќ
The
hair
that
had
retreated
from
MormontвЂ™s
spotted
scalp
had
regrouped
beneath
his
chin
in
a
shaggy
grey
beard
that
covered
much
of
his
chest.
He
thumped
it
hard.
вЂњDo
I
look
frail?вЂќ

Sam
opened
his
mouth,
gave
a
little
squeak.
The
Old
Bear
terrified
him.
вЂњNo,
my
lord,вЂќ
Jon
offered
quickly.
вЂњYou
look
strong
as
aвЂ¦
aвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
cozen
me,
Snow,
you
know
I
wonвЂ™t
have
it.
Let
me
have
a
look
at
these
maps.вЂќ
Mormont
pawed
through
them
brusquely,
giving
each
no
more
than
a
glance
and
a
grunt.
вЂњWas
this
all
you
could
find?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦
m-m-my
lord,вЂќ
Sam
stammered,
вЂњthereвЂ¦
there
were
more,
b-b-butвЂ¦
the
dis-disorderвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThese
are
old,вЂќ
Mormont
complained,
and
his
raven
echoed
him
with
a
sharp
cry
of
вЂњOld,
old.вЂќ

вЂњThe
villages
may
come
and
go,
but
the
hills
and
rivers
will
be
in
the
same
places,вЂќ
Jon
pointed
out.

вЂњTrue
enough.
Have
you
chosen
your
ravens
yet,
Tarly?вЂќ

вЂњM-m-maester
Aemon
m-means
to
p-pick
them
come
evenfall,
after
the
f-f-feeding.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
his
best.
Smart
birds,
and
strong.вЂќ

вЂњStrong,вЂќ
his
own
bird
said,
preening.
вЂњStrong,
strong.вЂќ

вЂњIf
it
happens
that
weвЂ™re
all
butchered
out
there,
I
mean
for
my
successor
to
know
where
and
how
we
died.вЂќ

Talk
of
butchery
reduced
Samwell
Tarly
to
speechlessness.
Mormont
leaned
forward.
вЂњTarly,
when
I
was
a
lad
half
your
age,
my
lady
mother
told
me
that
if
I
stood
about
with
my
mouth
open,
a
weasel
was
like
to
mistake
it
for
his
lair
and
run
down
my
throat.
If
you
have
something
to
say,
say
it.
Otherwise,
beware
of
weasels.вЂќ
He
waved
a
brusque
dismissal.
вЂњOff
with
you,
IвЂ™m
too
busy
for
folly.
No
doubt
the
maester
has
some
work
you
can
do.вЂќ

Sam
swallowed,
stepped
back,
and
scurried
out
so
quickly
he
almost
tripped
over
the
rushes.

вЂњIs
that
boy
as
big
a
fool
as
he
seems?вЂќ
the
Lord
Commander
asked
when
heвЂ™d
gone.
вЂњFool,вЂќ
the
raven
complained.
Mormont
did
not
wait
for
Jon
to
answer.
вЂњHis
lord
father
stands
high
in
King
RenlyвЂ™s
councils,
and
I
had
half
a
notion
to
dispatch
himвЂ¦
no,
best
not.
Renly
is
not
like
to
heed
a
quaking
fat
boy.
IвЂ™ll
send
Ser
Arnell.
HeвЂ™s
a
deal
steadier,
and
his
mother
was
one
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways.вЂќ

вЂњIf
it
please
my
lord,
what
would
you
have
of
King
Renly?вЂќ

вЂњThe
same
things
IвЂ™d
have
of
all
of
them,
lad.
Men,
horses,
swords,
armor,
grain,
cheese,
wine,
wool,
nailsвЂ¦
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
is
not
proud,
we
take
what
is
offered.вЂќ
His
fingers
drummed
against
the
roughhewn
planks
of
the
table.
вЂњIf
the
winds
have
been
kind,
Ser
Alliser
should
reach
KingвЂ™s
Landing
by
the
turn
of
the
moon,
but
whether
this
boy
Joffrey
will
pay
him
any
heed,
I
do
not
know.
House
Lannister
has
never
been
a
friend
to
the
Watch.вЂќ

вЂњThorne
has
the
wightвЂ™s
hand
to
show
them.вЂќ
A
grisly
pale
thing
with
black
fingers,
it
was,
that
twitched
and
stirred
in
its
jar
as
if
it
were
still
alive.

вЂњWould
that
we
had
another
hand
to
send
to
Renly.вЂќ

вЂњDywen
says
you
can
find
anything
beyond
the
Wall.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
Dywen
says.
And
the
last
time
he
went
ranging,
he
says
he
saw
a
bear
fifteen
feet
tall.вЂќ
Mormont
snorted.
вЂњMy
sister
is
said
to
have
taken
a
bear
for
her
lover.
IвЂ™d
believe
that
before
IвЂ™d
believe
one
fifteen
feet
tall.
Though
in
a
world
where
dead
come
walkingвЂ¦
ah,
even
so,
a
man
must
believe
his
eyes.
I
have
seen
the
dead
walk.
IвЂ™ve
not
seen
any
giant
bears.вЂќ
He
gave
Jon
a
long,
searching
look.
вЂњBut
we
were
speaking
of
hands.
How
is
yours?вЂќ

вЂњBetter.вЂќ
Jon
peeled
off
his
moleskin
glove
and
showed
him.
Scars
covered
his
arm
halfway
to
the
elbow,
and
the
mottled
pink
flesh
still
felt
tight
and
tender,
but
it
was
healing.
вЂњIt
itches,
though.
Maester
Aemon
says
thatвЂ™s
good.
He
gave
me
a
salve
to
take
with
me
when
we
ride.вЂќ

вЂњYou
can
wield
Longclaw
despite
the
pain?вЂќ

вЂњWell
enough.вЂќ
Jon
flexed
his
fingers,
opening
and
closing
his
fist
the
way
the
maester
had
shown
him.
вЂњIвЂ™m
to
work
the
fingers
every
day
to
keep
them
nimble,
as
Maester
Aemon
said.вЂќ

вЂњBlind
he
may
be,
but
Aemon
knows
what
heвЂ™s
about.
I
pray
the
gods
let
us
keep
him
another
twenty
years.
Do
you
know
that
he
might
have
been
king?вЂќ

Jon
was
taken
by
surprise.
вЂњHe
told
me
his
father
was
king,
but
notвЂ¦
I
thought
him
perhaps
a
younger
son.вЂќ

вЂњSo
he
was.
His
fatherвЂ™s
father
was
Daeron
Targaryen,
the
Second
of
His
Name,
who
brought
Dorne
into
the
realm.
Part
of
the
pact
was
that
he
wed
a
Dornish
princess.
She
gave
him
four
sons.
AemonвЂ™s
father
Maekar
was
the
youngest
of
those,
and
Aemon
was
his
third
son.
Mind
you,
all
this
happened
long
before
I
was
born,
ancient
as
Smallwood
would
make
me.вЂќ

вЂњMaester
Aemon
was
named
for
the
Dragonknight.вЂќ

вЂњSo
he
was.
Some
say
Prince
Aemon
was
King
DaeronвЂ™s
true
father,
not
Aegon
the
Unworthy.
Be
that
as
it
may,
our
Aemon
lacked
the
DragonknightвЂ™s
martial
nature.
He
likes
to
say
he
had
a
slow
sword
but
quick
wits.
Small
wonder
his
grandfather
packed
him
off
to
the
Citadel.
He
was
nine
or
ten,
I
believeвЂ¦
and
ninth
or
tenth
in
the
line
of
succession
as
well.вЂќ

Maester
Aemon
had
counted
more
than
a
hundred
name
days,
Jon
knew.
Frail,
shrunken,
wizened,
and
blind,
it
was
hard
to
imagine
him
as
a
little
boy
no
older
than
Arya.

Mormont
continued.
вЂњAemon
was
at
his
books
when
the
eldest
of
his
uncles,
the
heir
apparent,
was
slain
in
a
tourney
mishap.
He
left
two
sons,
but
they
followed
him
to
the
grave
not
long
after,
during
the
Great
Spring
Sickness.
King
Daeron
was
also
taken,
so
the
crown
passed
to
DaeronвЂ™s
second
son,
Aerys.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Mad
King?вЂќ
Jon
was
confused.
Aerys
had
been
king
before
Robert,
that
wasnвЂ™t
so
long
ago.

вЂњNo,
this
was
Aerys
the
First.
The
one
Robert
deposed
was
the
second
of
that
name.вЂќ

вЂњHow
long
ago
was
this?вЂќ

вЂњEighty
years
or
close
enough,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
said,
вЂњand
no,
I
still
hadnвЂ™t
been
born,
though
Aemon
had
forged
half
a
dozen
links
of
his
maesterвЂ™s
chain
by
then.
Aerys
wed
his
own
sister,
as
the
Targaryens
were
wont
to
do,
and
reigned
for
ten
or
twelve
years.
Aemon
took
his
vows
and
left
the
Citadel
to
serve
at
some
lordlingвЂ™s
courtвЂ¦
until
his
royal
uncle
died
without
issue.
The
Iron
Throne
passed
to
the
last
of
King
DaeronвЂ™s
four
sons.
That
was
Maekar,
AemonвЂ™s
father.
The
new
king
summoned
all
his
sons
to
court
and
would
have
made
Aemon
part
of
his
councils,
but
he
refused,
saying
that
would
usurp
the
place
rightly
belonging
to
the
Grand
Maester.
Instead
he
served
at
the
keep
of
his
eldest
brother,
another
Daeron.
Well,
that
one
died
too,
leaving
only
a
feeble-witted
daughter
as
heir.
Some
pox
he
caught
from
a
whore,
I
believe.
The
next
brother
was
Aerion.вЂќ

вЂњAerion
the
Monstrous?вЂќ
Jon
knew
that
name.
вЂњThe
Prince
Who
Thought
He
Was
a
DragonвЂќ
was
one
of
Old
NanвЂ™s
more
gruesome
tales.
His
little
brother
Bran
had
loved
it.

вЂњThe
very
one,
though
he
named
himself
Aerion
Brightflame.
One
night,
in
his
cups,
he
drank
a
jar
of
wildfire,
after
telling
his
friends
it
would
transform
him
into
a
dragon,
but
the
gods
were
kind
and
it
transformed
him
into
a
corpse.
Not
quite
a
year
after,
King
Maekar
died
in
battle
against
an
outlaw
lord.вЂќ

Jon
was
not
entirely
innocent
of
the
history
of
the
realm;
his
own
maester
had
seen
to
that.
вЂњThat
was
the
year
of
the
Great
Council,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњThe
lords
passed
over
Prince
AerionвЂ™s
infant
son
and
Prince
DaeronвЂ™s
daughter
and
gave
the
crown
to
Aegon.вЂќ

вЂњYes
and
no.
First
they
offered
it,
quietly,
to
Aemon.
And
quietly
he
refused.
The
gods
meant
for
him
to
serve,
not
to
rule,
he
told
them.
He
had
sworn
a
vow
and
would
not
break
it,
though
the
High
Septon
himself
offered
to
absolve
him.
Well,
no
sane
man
wanted
any
blood
of
AerionвЂ™s
on
the
throne,
and
DaeronвЂ™s
girl
was
a
lackwit
besides
being
female,
so
they
had
no
choice
but
to
turn
to
AemonвЂ™s
younger
brotherвЂ”Aegon,
the
Fifth
of
His
Name.
Aegon
the
Unlikely,
they
called
him,
born
the
fourth
son
of
a
fourth
son.
Aemon
knew,
and
rightly,
that
if
he
remained
at
court
those
who
disliked
his
brotherвЂ™s
rule
would
seek
to
use
him,
so
he
came
to
the
Wall.
And
here
he
has
remained,
while
his
brother
and
his
brotherвЂ™s
son
and
his
son
each
reigned
and
died
in
turn,
until
Jaime
Lannister
put
an
end
to
the
line
of
the
Dragonkings.вЂќ

вЂњKing,вЂќ
croaked
the
raven.
The
bird
flapped
across
the
solar
to
land
on
MormontвЂ™s
shoulder.
вЂњKing,вЂќ
it
said
again,
strutting
back
and
forth.

вЂњHe
likes
that
word,вЂќ
Jon
said,
smiling.

вЂњAn
easy
word
to
say.
An
easy
word
to
like.вЂќ

вЂњKing,вЂќ
the
bird
said
again.

вЂњI
think
he
means
for
you
to
have
a
crown,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњThe
realm
has
three
kings
already,
and
thatвЂ™s
two
too
many
for
my
liking.вЂќ
Mormont
stroked
the
raven
under
the
beak
with
a
finger,
but
all
the
while
his
eyes
never
left
Jon
Snow.

It
made
him
feel
odd.
вЂњMy
lord,
why
have
you
told
me
this,
about
Maester
Aemon?вЂќ

вЂњMust
I
have
a
reason?вЂќ
Mormont
shifted
in
his
seat,
frowning.
вЂњYour
brother
Robb
has
been
crowned
King
in
the
North.
You
and
Aemon
have
that
in
common.
A
king
for
a
brother.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
this
too,вЂќ
said
Jon.
вЂњA
vow.вЂќ

The
Old
Bear
gave
a
loud
snort,
and
the
raven
took
flight,
flapping
in
a
circle
about
the
room,
вЂњGive
me
a
man
for
every
vow
IвЂ™ve
seen
broken
and
the
Wall
will
never
lack
for
defenders.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve
always
known
that
Robb
would
be
Lord
of
Winterfell.вЂќ

Mormont
gave
a
whistle,
and
the
bird
flew
to
him
again
and
settled
on
his
arm.
вЂњA
lordвЂ™s
one
thing,
a
kingвЂ™s
another.вЂќ
He
offered
the
raven
a
handful
of
corn
from
his
pocket.
вЂњThey
will
garb
your
brother
Robb
in
silks,
satins,
and
velvets
of
a
hundred
different
colors,
while
you
live
and
die
in
black
ringmail.
He
will
wed
some
beautiful
princess
and
father
sons
on
her.
YouвЂ™ll
have
no
wife,
nor
will
you
ever
hold
a
child
of
your
own
blood
in
your
arms.
Robb
will
rule,
you
will
serve.
Men
will
call
you
a
crow.
Him
theyвЂ™ll
call
Your
Grace.
Singers
will
praise
every
little
thing
he
does,
while
your
greatest
deeds
all
go
unsung.
Tell
me
that
none
of
this
troubles
you,
JonвЂ¦
and
IвЂ™ll
name
you
a
liar,
and
know
I
have
the
truth
of
it.вЂќ

Jon
drew
himself
up,
taut
as
a
bowstring.
вЂњAnd
if
it
did
trouble
me,
what
might
I
do,
bastard
as
I
am?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
will
you
do?вЂќ
Mormont
asked.
вЂњBastard
as
you
are?вЂќ

вЂњBe
troubled,вЂќ
said
Jon,
вЂњand
keep
my
vows.вЂќ





CATELYN

Her
sonвЂ™s
crown
was
fresh
from
the
forge,
and
it
seemed
to
Catelyn
Stark
that
the
weight
of
it
pressed
heavy
on
RobbвЂ™s
head.

The
ancient
crown
of
the
Kings
of
Winter
had
been
lost
three
centuries
ago,
yielded
up
to
Aegon
the
Conqueror
when
Torrhen
Stark
knelt
in
submission.
What
Aegon
had
done
with
it
no
man
could
say.
Lord
HosterвЂ™s
smith
had
done
his
work
well,
and
RobbвЂ™s
crown
looked
much
as
the
other
was
said
to
have
looked
in
the
tales
told
of
the
Stark
kings
of
old;
an
open
circlet
of
hammered
bronze
incised
with
the
runes
of
the
First
Men,
surmounted
by
nine
black
iron
spikes
wrought
in
the
shape
of
longswords.
Of
gold
and
silver
and
gemstones,
it
had
none;
bronze
and
iron
were
the
metals
of
winter,
dark
and
strong
to
fight
against
the
cold.

As
they
waited
in
RiverrunвЂ™s
Great
Hall
for
the
prisoner
to
be
brought
before
them,
she
saw
Robb
push
back
the
crown
so
it
rested
upon
the
thick
auburn
mop
of
his
hair;
moments
later,
he
moved
it
forward
again;
later
he
gave
it
a
quarter
turn,
as
if
that
might
make
it
sit
more
easily
on
his
brow.
It
is
no
easy
thing
to
wear
a
crown,
Catelyn
thought,
watching,
especially
for
a
boy
of
fifteen
years.

When
the
guards
brought
in
the
captive,
Robb
called
for
his
sword.
Olyvar
Frey
offered
it
up
hilt
first,
and
her
son
drew
the
blade
and
laid
it
bare
across
his
knees,
a
threat
plain
for
all
to
see.
вЂњYour
Grace,
here
is
the
man
you
asked
for,вЂќ
announced
Ser
Robin
Ryger,
captain
of
the
Tully
household
guard.

вЂњKneel
before
the
king,
Lannister!вЂќ
Theon
Greyjoy
shouted.
Ser
Robin
forced
the
prisoner
to
his
knees.

He
did
not
look
a
lion,
Catelyn
reflected.
This
Ser
Cleos
Frey
was
a
son
of
the
Lady
Genna
who
was
sister
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
but
he
had
none
of
the
fabled
Lannister
beauty,
the
fair
hair
and
green
eyes.
Instead
he
had
inherited
the
stringy
brown
locks,
weak
chin,
and
thin
face
of
his
sire,
Ser
Emmon
Frey,
old
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
second
son.
His
eyes
were
pale
and
watery
and
he
could
not
seem
to
stop
blinking,
but
perhaps
that
was
only
the
light.
The
cells
below
Riverrun
were
dark
and
dampвЂ¦
and
these
days
crowded
as
well.

вЂњRise,
Ser
Cleos.вЂќ
Her
sonвЂ™s
voice
was
not
as
icy
as
his
fatherвЂ™s
would
have
been,
but
he
did
not
sound
a
boy
of
fifteen
either.
War
had
made
a
man
of
him
before
his
time.
Morning
light
glimmered
faintly
against
the
edge
of
the
steel
across
his
knees.

Yet
it
was
not
the
sword
that
made
Ser
Cleos
Frey
anxious;
it
was
the
beast.
Grey
Wind,
her
son
had
named
him.
A
direwolf
large
as
any
elkhound,
lean
and
smoke-dark,
with
eyes
like
molten
gold.
When
the
beast
padded
forward
and
sniffed
at
the
captive
knight,
every
man
in
that
hall
could
smell
the
scent
of
fear.
Ser
Cleos
had
been
taken
during
the
battle
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
where
Grey
Wind
had
ripped
out
the
throats
of
half
a
dozen
men.

The
knight
scrambled
up,
edging
away
with
such
alacrity
that
some
of
the
watchers
laughed
aloud.
вЂњThank
you,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
barked
Lord
Umber,
the
Greatjon,
ever
the
loudest
of
RobbвЂ™s
northern
bannermenвЂ¦
and
the
truest
and
fiercest
as
well,
or
so
he
insisted.
He
had
been
the
first
to
proclaim
her
son
King
in
the
North,
and
he
would
brook
no
slight
to
the
honor
of
his
new-made
sovereign.

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
corrected
hastily.
вЂњPardons.вЂќ

He
is
not
a
bold
man,
this
one,
Catelyn
thought.
More
of
a
Frey
than
a
Lannister,
in
truth.
His
cousin
the
Kingslayer
would
have
been
a
much
different
matter.
They
would
never
have
gotten
that
honorific
through
Ser
Jaime
LannisterвЂ™s
perfect
teeth.

вЂњI
brought
you
from
your
cell
to
carry
my
message
to
your
cousin
Cersei
Lannister
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
YouвЂ™ll
travel
under
a
peace
banner,
with
thirty
of
my
best
men
to
escort
you.вЂќ

Ser
Cleos
was
visibly
relieved.
вЂњThen
I
should
be
most
glad
to
bring
His
GraceвЂ™s
message
to
the
queen.вЂќ

вЂњUnderstand,вЂќ
Robb
said,
вЂњI
am
not
giving
you
your
freedom.
Your
grandfather
Lord
Walder
pledged
me
his
support
and
that
of
House
Frey.
Many
of
your
cousins
and
uncles
rode
with
us
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
but
you
chose
to
fight
beneath
the
lion
banner.
That
makes
you
a
Lannister,
not
a
Frey.
I
want
your
pledge,
on
your
honor
as
a
knight,
that
after
you
deliver
my
message
youвЂ™ll
return
with
the
queenвЂ™s
reply,
and
resume
your
captivity.вЂќ

Ser
Cleos
answered
at
once.
вЂњI
do
so
vow.вЂќ

вЂњEvery
man
in
this
hall
has
heard
you,вЂќ
warned
CatelynвЂ™s
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
who
spoke
for
Riverrun
and
the
lords
of
the
Trident
in
the
place
of
their
dying
father.
вЂњIf
you
do
not
return,
the
whole
realm
will
know
you
forsworn.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
do
as
I
pledged,вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
replied
stiffly.
вЂњWhat
is
this
message?
вЂњ

вЂњAn
offer
of
peace.вЂќ
Robb
stood,
longsword
in
hand.
Grey
Wind
moved
to
his
side.
The
hall
grew
hushed.
вЂњTell
the
Queen
Regent
that
if
she
meets
my
terms,
I
will
sheath
this
sword,
and
make
an
end
to
the
war
between
us.вЂќ

In
the
back
of
the
hall,
Catelyn
glimpsed
the
tall,
gaunt
figure
of
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
shove
through
a
rank
of
guards
and
out
the
door.
No
one
else
moved.
Robb
paid
the
disruption
no
mind.
вЂњOlyvar,
the
paper,вЂќ
he
commanded.
The
squire
took
his
longsword
and
handed
up
a
rolled
parchment.

Robb
unrolled
it.
вЂњFirst,
the
queen
must
release
my
sisters
and
provide
them
with
transport
by
sea
from
KingвЂ™s
Landing
to
White
Harbor.
It
is
to
be
understood
that
SansaвЂ™s
betrothal
to
Joffrey
Baratheon
is
at
an
end.
When
I
receive
word
from
my
castellan
that
my
sisters
have
returned
unharmed
to
Winterfell,
I
will
release
the
queenвЂ™s
cousins,
the
squire
Willem
Lannister
and
your
brother
Tion
Frey,
and
give
them
safe
escort
to
Casterly
Rock
or
wheresoever
she
desires
them
delivered.вЂќ

Catelyn
Stark
wished
she
could
read
the
thoughts
that
hid
behind
each
face,
each
furrowed
brow
and
pair
of
tightened
lips.

вЂњSecondly,
my
lord
fatherвЂ™s
bones
will
be
returned
to
us,
so
he
may
rest
beside
his
brother
and
sister
in
the
crypts
beneath
Winterfell,
as
he
would
have
wished.
The
remains
of
the
men
of
his
household
guard
who
died
in
his
service
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing
must
also
be
returned.вЂќ

Living
men
had
gone
south,
and
cold
bones
would
return.
Ned
had
the
truth
of
it,
she
thought.
His
place
was
at
Winterfell,
he
said
as
much,
but
would
I
hear
him?
No.
Go,
I
told
him,
you
must
be
RobertвЂ™s
Hand,
for
the
good
of
our
House,
for
the
sake
of
our
childrenвЂ¦
my
doing,
mine,
no
otherвЂ¦

вЂњThird,
my
fatherвЂ™s
greatsword
Ice
will
be
delivered
to
my
hand,
here
at
Riverrun.вЂќ

She
watched
her
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully
as
he
stood
with
his
thumbs
hooked
over
his
swordbelt,
his
face
as
still
as
stone.

вЂњFourth,
the
queen
will
command
her
father
Lord
Tywin
to
release
those
knights
and
lords
bannermen
of
mine
that
he
took
captive
in
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Once
he
does
so,
I
shall
release
my
own
captives
taken
in
the
Whispering
Wood
and
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
save
Jaime
Lannister
alone,
who
will
remain
my
hostage
for
his
fatherвЂ™s
good
behavior.вЂќ

She
studied
Theon
GreyjoyвЂ™s
sly
smile,
wondering
what
it
meant.
That
young
man
had
a
way
of
looking
as
though
he
knew
some
secret
jest
that
only
he
was
privy
to;
Catelyn
had
never
liked
it.

вЂњLastly,
King
Joffrey
and
the
Queen
Regent
must
renounce
all
claims
to
dominion
over
the
north.
Henceforth
we
are
no
part
of
their
realm,
but
a
free
and
independent
kingdom,
as
of
old.
Our
domain
shall
include
all
the
Stark
lands
north
of
the
Neck,
and
in
addition
the
lands
watered
by
the
River
Trident
and
its
vassal
streams,
bounded
by
the
Golden
Tooth
to
the
west
and
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
in
the
east.вЂќ

вЂњTHE
KING
IN
THE
NORTH!вЂќ
boomed
Greatjon
Umber,
a
ham-sized
fist
hammering
at
the
air
as
he
shouted.
вЂњStark!
Stark!
The
King
in
the
North!вЂќ

Robb
rolled
up
the
parchment
again.
вЂњMaester
Vyman
has
drawn
a
map,
showing
the
borders
we
claim.
You
shall
have
a
copy
for
the
queen.
Lord
Tywin
must
withdraw
beyond
these
borders,
and
cease
his
raiding,
burning,
and
pillage.
The
Queen
Regent
and
her
son
shall
make
no
claims
to
taxes,
incomes,
nor
service
from
my
people,
and
shall
free
my
lords
and
knights
from
all
oaths
of
fealty,
vows,
pledges,
debts,
and
obligations
owed
to
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister.
Additionally,
the
Lannisters
shall
deliver
ten
highborn
hostages,
to
be
mutually
agreed
upon,
as
a
pledge
of
peace.
These
I
will
treat
as
honored
guests,
according
to
their
station.
So
long
as
the
terms
of
this
pact
are
abided
with
faithfully,
I
shall
release
two
hostages
every
year,
and
return
them
safely
to
their
families.вЂќ
Robb
tossed
the
rolled
parchment
at
the
knightвЂ™s
feet.
вЂњThere
are
the
terms.
If
she
meets
them,
IвЂ™ll
give
her
peace.
if
notвЂќвЂ”he
whistled,
and
Grey
Wind
moved
forward
snarlingвЂ”вЂњIвЂ™ll
give
her
another
Whispering
Wood.вЂќ

вЂњStark!вЂќ
the
Greatjon
roared
again,
and
now
other
voices
took
up
the
cry.
вЂњStark,
Stark,
King
in
the
North!вЂќ
The
direwolf
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.

Ser
Cleos
had
gone
the
color
of
curdled
milk.
вЂњThe
queen
shall
hear
your
message,
myвЂ”Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњGood,вЂќ
Robb
said.
вЂњSer
Robin,
see
that
he
has
a
good
meal
and
clean
clothing.
HeвЂ™s
to
ride
at
first
light.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
command,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Ser
Robin
Ryger
replied.

вЂњThen
we
are
done.вЂќ
The
assembled
knights
and
lords
bannermen
bent
their
knees
as
Robb
turned
to
leave,
Grey
Wind
at
his
heels.
Olyvar
Frey
scrambled
ahead
to
open
the
door.
Catelyn
followed
them
out,
her
brother
at
her
side.

вЂњYou
did
well,вЂќ
she
told
her
son
in
the
gallery
that
led
from
the
rear
of
the
hall,
вЂњthough
that
business
with
the
wolf
was
japery
more
befitting
a
boy
than
a
king.вЂќ

Robb
scratched
Grey
Wind
behind
the
ear.
вЂњDid
you
see
the
look
on
his
face,
Mother?вЂќ
he
asked,
smiling.

вЂњWhat
I
saw
was
Lord
Karstark,
walking
out.вЂќ

вЂњAs
did
I.вЂќ
Robb
lifted
off
his
crown
with
both
hands
and
gave
it
to
Olyvar.
вЂњTake
this
thing
back
to
my
bedchamber.вЂќ

вЂњAt
once,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
The
squire
hurried
off.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
wager
there
were
others
who
felt
the
same
as
Lord
Karstark,вЂќ
her
brother
Edmure
declared.
вЂњHow
can
we
talk
of
peace
while
the
Lannisters
spread
like
a
pestilence
over
my
fatherвЂ™s
domains,
stealing
his
crops
and
slaughtering
his
people?
I
say
again,
we
ought
to
be
marching
on
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњWe
lack
the
strength,вЂќ
Robb
said,
though
unhappily.

Edmure
persisted.
вЂњDo
we
grow
stronger
sitting
here?
Our
host
dwindles
every
day.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
whose
doing
is
that?вЂќ
Catelyn
snapped
at
her
brother.
It
had
been
at
EdmureвЂ™s
insistence
that
Robb
had
given
the
river
lords
leave
to
depart
after
his
crowning,
each
to
defend
his
own
lands.
Ser
Marq
Piper
and
Lord
Karyl
Vance
had
been
the
first
to
go.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
had
followed,
vowing
to
reclaim
the
burnt
shell
of
his
castle
and
bury
his
dead,
and
now
Lord
Jason
Mallister
had
announced
his
intent
to
return
to
his
seat
at
Seagard,
still
mercifully
untouched
by
the
fighting.

вЂњYou
cannot
ask
my
river
lords
to
remain
idle
while
their
fields
are
being
pillaged
and
their
people
put
to
the
sword,вЂќ
Ser
Edmure
said,
вЂњbut
Lord
Karstark
is
a
northman.
It
would
be
an
ill
thing
if
he
were
to
leave
us.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
speak
with
him,вЂќ
said
Robb.
вЂњHe
lost
two
sons
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
Who
can
blame
him
if
he
does
not
want
to
make
peace
with
their
killersвЂ¦
with
my
fatherвЂ™s
killersвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњMore
bloodshed
will
not
bring
your
father
back
to
us,
or
Lord
RickardвЂ™s
sons,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњAn
offer
had
to
be
madeвЂ”though
a
wiser
man
might
have
offered
sweeter
terms.вЂќ

вЂњAny
sweeter
and
I
would
have
gagged.вЂќ
Her
sonвЂ™s
beard
had
grown
in
redder
than
his
auburn
hair.
Robb
seemed
to
think
it
made
him
look
fierce,
royalвЂ¦
older.
But
bearded
or
no,
he
was
still
a
youth
of
fifteen,
and
wanted
vengeance
no
less
than
Rickard
Karstark.
it
had
been
no
easy
thing
to
convince
him
to
make
even
this
offer,
poor
as
it
was.

вЂњCersei
Lannister
will
never
consent
to
trade
your
sisters
for
a
pair
of
cousins.
ItвЂ™s
her
brother
sheвЂ™ll
want,
as
you
know
full
well.вЂќ
She
had
told
him
as
much
before,
but
Catelyn
was
finding
that
kings
do
not
listen
half
so
attentively
as
sons.

вЂњI
canвЂ™t
release
the
Kingslayer,
not
even
if
I
wanted
to.
My
lords
would
never
abide
it.вЂќ

вЂњYour
lords
made
you
their
king.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
can
unmake
me
just
as
easy.вЂќ

вЂњIf
your
crown
is
the
price
we
must
pay
to
have
Arya
and
Sansa
returned
safe,
we
should
pay
it
willingly.
Half
your
lords
would
like
to
murder
Lannister
in
his
cell.
If
he
should
die
while
heвЂ™s
your
prisoner,
men
will
sayвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”that
he
well
deserved
it,вЂќ
Robb
finished.

вЂњAnd
your
sisters?вЂќ
Catelyn
asked
sharply.
вЂњWill
they
deserve
their
deaths
as
well?
I
promise
you,
if
any
harm
comes
to
her
brother,
Cersei
will
pay
us
back
blood
for
bloodвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњLannister
wonвЂ™t
die,вЂќ
Robb
said.
вЂњNo
one
so
much
as
speaks
to
him
without
my
warrant.
He
has
food,
water,
clean
straw,
more
comfort
than
he
has
any
right
to.
But
I
wonвЂ™t
free
him,
not
even
for
Arya
and
Sansa.вЂќ

Her
son
was
looking
down
at
her,
Catelyn
realized.
Was
it
war
that
made
him
grow
so
fast,
she
wondered,
or
the
crown
they
had
put
on
his
head?
вЂњAre
you
afraid
to
have
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
field
again,
is
that
the
truth
of
it?вЂќ

Grey
Wind
growled,
as
if
he
sensed
RobbвЂ™s
anger,
and
Edmure
Tully
put
a
brotherly
hand
on
CatelynвЂ™s
shoulder.
вЂњCat,
donвЂ™t.
The
boy
has
the
right
of
this.вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
call
me
the
boy,вЂќ
Robb
said,
rounding
on
his
uncle,
his
anger
spilling
out
all
at
once
on
poor
Edmure,
who
had
only
meant
to
support
him.
вЂњIвЂ™m
almost
a
man
grown,
and
a
kingвЂ”your
king,
ser.
And
I
donвЂ™t
fear
Jaime
Lannister.
I
defeated
him
once,
IвЂ™ll
defeat
him
again
if
I
must,
onlyвЂ¦вЂќ
He
pushed
a
fall
of
hair
out
of
his
eyes
and
gave
a
shake
of
the
head.
вЂњI
might
have
been
able
to
trade
the
Kingslayer
for
Father,
butвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦but
not
for
the
girls?вЂќ
Her
voice
was
icy
quiet.
вЂњGirls
are
not
important
enough,
are
they?вЂќ

Robb
made
no
answer,
but
there
was
hurt
in
his
eyes.
Blue
eyes,
Tully
eyes,
eyes
she
had
given
him.
She
had
wounded
him,
but
he
was
too
much
his
fatherвЂ™s
son
to
admit
it.

That
was
unworthy
of
me,
she
told
herself.
Gods
be
good,
what
is
to
become
of
me?
He
is
doing
his
best,
trying
so
hard,
I
know
it,
I
see
it,
and
yetвЂ¦
I
have
lost
my
Ned,
the
rock
my
life
was
built
on,
I
could
not
bear
to
lose
the
girls
as
wellвЂ¦

вЂњIвЂ™ll
do
all
I
can
for
my
sisters,вЂќ
Robb
said.
вЂњIf
the
queen
has
any
sense,
sheвЂ™ll
accept
my
terms.
If
not,
IвЂ™ll
make
her
rue
the
day
she
refused
me.вЂќ

Plainly,
heвЂ™d
had
enough
of
the
subject.
вЂњMother,
are
you
certain
you
will
not
consent
to
go
to
the
Twins?
You
would
be
farther
from
the
fighting,
and
you
could
acquaint
yourself
with
Lord
FreyвЂ™s
daughters
to
help
me
choose
my
bride
when
the
war
is
done.вЂќ

He
wants
me
gone,
Catelyn
thought
wearily.
Kings
are
not
supposed
to
have
mothers,
it
would
seem,
and
I
tell
him
things
he
does
not
want
to
hear.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
old
enough
to
decide
which
of
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
girls
you
prefer
without
your
motherвЂ™s
help,
Robb.вЂќ

вЂњThen
go
with
Theon.
He
leaves
on
the
morrow.
HeвЂ™ll
help
the
Mallisters
escort
that
lot
of
captives
to
Seagard
and
then
take
ship
for
the
Iron
Islands.
You
could
find
a
ship
as
well,
and
be
back
at
Winterfell
with
a
moonвЂ™s
turn,
if
the
winds
are
kind.
Bran
and
Rickon
need
you.вЂќ

And
you
do
not,
is
that
what
you
mean
to
say?
вЂњMy
lord
father
has
little
enough
time
remaining
him.
So
long
as
your
grandfather
lives,
my
place
is
at
Riverrun
with
him.вЂќ

вЂњI
could
command
you
to
go.
As
king.
I
could.вЂќ

Catelyn
ignored
that.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
say
again,
I
would
sooner
you
sent
someone
else
to
Pyke,
and
kept
Theon
close
to
you.вЂќ

вЂњWho
better
to
treat
with
Balon
Greyjoy
than
his
son?вЂќ

вЂњJason
Mallister,вЂќ
offered
Catelyn.
вЂњTytos
Blackwood.
Stevron
Frey.
AnyoneвЂ¦
but
not
Theon.вЂќ

Her
son
squatted
beside
Grey
Wind,
ruffling
the
wolfвЂ™s
fur
and
incidentally
avoiding
her
eyes.
вЂњTheonвЂ™s
fought
bravely
for
us.
I
told
you
how
he
saved
Bran
from
those
wildlings
in
the
wolfswood.
If
the
Lannisters
wonвЂ™t
make
peace,
IвЂ™ll
have
need
of
Lord
GreyjoyвЂ™s
longships.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
have
them
sooner
if
you
keep
his
son
as
hostage.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
been
a
hostage
half
his
life.вЂќ

вЂњFor
good
reason,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњBalon
Greyjoy
is
not
a
man
to
be
trusted.
He
wore
a
crown
himself,
remember,
if
only
for
a
season.
He
may
aspire
to
wear
one
again.вЂќ

Robb
stood.
вЂњI
will
not
grudge
him
that.
If
IвЂ™m
King
in
the
North,
let
him
be
King
of
the
Iron
Islands,
if
thatвЂ™s
his
desire.
IвЂ™ll
give
him
a
crown
gladly,
so
long
as
he
helps
us
bring
down
the
Lannisters.вЂќ

вЂњRobbвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
sending
Theon.
Good
day,
Mother.
Grey
Wind,
come.вЂќ
Robb
walked
off
briskly,
the
direwolf
padding
beside
him.

Catelyn
could
only
watch
him
go.
Her
son
and
now
her
king.
How
queer
that
felt.
Command,
she
had
told
him
back
in
Moat
Cailin.
And
so
he
did.
вЂњI
am
going
to
visit
Father,вЂќ
she
announced
abruptly.
вЂњCome
with
me,
Edmure.вЂќ

вЂњI
need
to
have
a
word
with
those
new
bowmen
Ser
Desmond
is
training.
IвЂ™ll
visit
him
later.вЂќ

If
he
still
lives,
Catelyn
thought,
but
she
said
nothing.
Her
brother
would
sooner
face
battle
than
that
sickroom.

The
shortest
way
to
the
central
keep
where
her
father
lay
dying
was
through
the
godswood,
with
its
grass
and
wildflowers
and
thick
stands
of
elm
and
redwood.
A
wealth
of
rustling
leaves
still
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
trees,
all
ignorant
of
the
word
the
white
raven
had
brought
to
Riverrun
a
fortnight
past.
Autumn
had
come,
the
Conclave
had
declared,
but
the
gods
had
not
seen
fit
to
tell
the
winds
and
woods
as
yet.
For
that
Catelyn
was
duly
grateful.
Autumn
was
always
a
fearful
time,
with
the
specter
of
winter
looming
ahead.
Even
the
wisest
man
never
knew
whether
his
next
harvest
would
be
the
last.

Hoster
Tully,
Lord
of
Riverrun,
lay
abed
in
his
solar,
with
its
commanding
view
to
the
east
where
the
rivers
Tumblestone
and
Red
Fork
met
beyond
the
walls
of
his
castle.
He
was
sleeping
when
Catelyn
entered,
his
hair
and
beard
as
white
as
his
featherbed,
his
once
portly
frame
turned
small
and
frail
by
the
death
that
grew
within
him.

Beside
the
bed,
still
dressed
in
mail
hauberk
and
travel-stained
cloak,
sat
her
fatherвЂ™s
brother,
the
Blackfish.
His
boots
were
dusty
and
spattered
with
dried
mud.
вЂњDoes
Robb
know
you
are
returned,
Uncle?вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
Tully
was
RobbвЂ™s
eyes
and
ears,
the
commander
of
his
scouts
and
outriders.

вЂњNo.
I
came
here
straight
from
the
stables,
when
they
told
me
the
king
was
holding
court.
His
Grace
will
want
to
hear
my
tidings
in
private
first
IвЂ™d
think.вЂќ
The
Blackfish
was
a
tall,
lean
man,
grey
of
hair
and
precise
in
his
movements,
his
clean-shaven
face
lined
and
windburnt.
вЂњHow
is
he?вЂќ
he
asked,
and
she
knew
he
did
not
mean
Robb.

вЂњMuch
the
same.
The
maester
gives
him
dreamwine
and
milk
of
the
poppy
for
his
pain,
so
he
sleeps
most
of
the
time,
and
eats
too
little.
He
seems
weaker
with
each
day
that
passes.вЂќ

вЂњDoes
he
speak?вЂќ

вЂњYesвЂ¦
but
there
is
less
and
less
sense
to
the
things
he
says.
He
talks
of
his
regrets,
of
unfinished
tasks,
of
people
long
dead
and
times
long
past.
Sometimes
he
does
not
know
what
season
it
is,
or
who
I
am.
Once
he
called
me
by
MotherвЂ™s
name.вЂќ

вЂњHe
misses
her
still,вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
answered.
вЂњYou
have
her
face.
I
can
see
it
in
your
cheekbones,
and
your
jawвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
remember
more
of
her
than
I
do.
It
has
been
a
long
time.вЂќ
She
seated
herself
on
the
bed
and
brushed
away
a
strand
of
fine
white
hair
that
had
fallen
across
her
fatherвЂ™s
face.

вЂњEach
time
I
ride
out,
I
wonder
if
I
shall
find
him
alive
or
dead
on
my
return.вЂќ
Despite
their
quarrels,
there
was
a
deep
bond
between
her
father
and
the
brother
he
had
once
disowned.

вЂњAt
least
you
made
your
peace
with
him.вЂќ

They
sat
for
a
time
in
silence,
until
Catelyn
raised
her
head.
вЂњYou
spoke
of
tidings
that
Robb
needed
to
hear?вЂќ
Lord
Hoster
moaned
and
rolled
onto
his
side,
almost
as
if
he
had
heard.

Brynden
stood.
вЂњCome
outside.
Best
if
we
do
not
wake
him.вЂќ

She
followed
him
out
onto
the
stone
balcony
that
jutted
three-sided
from
the
solar
like
the
prow
of
a
ship.
Her
uncle
glanced
up,
frowning.
вЂњYou
can
see
it
by
day
now.
My
men
call
it
the
Red
MessengerвЂ¦
but
what
is
the
message?вЂќ

Catelyn
raised
her
eyes,
to
where
the
faint
red
line
of
the
comet
traced
a
path
across
the
deep
blue
sky
like
a
long
scratch
across
the
face
of
god.
вЂњThe
Greatjon
told
Robb
that
the
old
gods
have
unfurled
a
red
flag
of
vengeance
for
Ned.
Edmure
thinks
itвЂ™s
an
omen
of
victory
for
RiverrunвЂ”he
sees
a
fish
with
a
long
tail,
in
the
Tully
colors,
red
against
blue.вЂќ
She
sighed.
вЂњI
wish
I
had
their
faith.
Crimson
is
a
Lannister
color.вЂќ

вЂњThat
thingвЂ™s
not
crimson,вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
said.
вЂњNor
Tully
red,
the
mud
red
of
the
river.
ThatвЂ™s
blood
up
there,
child,
smeared
across
the
sky.вЂќ

вЂњOur
blood
or
theirs?вЂќ

вЂњWas
there
ever
a
war
where
only
one
side
bled?вЂќ
Her
uncle
gave
a
shake
of
the
head.
вЂњThe
riverlands
are
awash
in
blood
and
flame
all
around
the
Gods
Eye.
The
fighting
has
spread
south
to
the
Blackwater
and
north
across
the
Trident,
almost
to
the
Twins.
Marq
Piper
and
Karyl
Vance
have
won
some
small
victories,
and
this
southron
lordling
Beric
Dondarrion
has
been
raiding
the
raiders,
falling
upon
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
foraging
parties
and
vanishing
back
into
the
woods.
ItвЂ™s
said
that
Ser
Burton
Crakehall
was
boasting
that
heвЂ™d
slain
Dondarrion,
until
he
led
his
column
into
one
of
Lord
BericвЂ™s
traps
and
got
every
man
of
them
killed.вЂќ

вЂњSome
of
NedвЂ™s
guard
from
KingвЂ™s
Landing
are
with
this
Lord
Beric,вЂќ
Catelyn
recalled.
вЂњMay
the
gods
preserve
them.вЂќ

вЂњDondarrion
and
this
red
priest
who
rides
with
him
are
clever
enough
to
preserve
themselves,
if
the
tales
be
true,вЂќ
her
uncle
said,
вЂњbut
your
fatherвЂ™s
bannermen
make
a
sadder
tale.
Robb
should
never
have
let
them
go.
TheyвЂ™ve
scattered
like
quail,
each
man
trying
to
protect
his
own,
and
itвЂ™s
folly,
Cat,
folly.
Jonos
Bracken
was
wounded
in
the
fighting
amidst
the
ruins
of
his
castle,
and
his
nephew
Hendry
slain.
Tytos
BlackwoodвЂ™s
swept
the
Lannisters
off
his
lands,
but
they
took
every
cow
and
pig
and
speck
of
grain
and
left
him
nothing
to
defend
but
Raventree
Hall
and
a
scorched
desert.
Darry
men
recaptured
their
lordвЂ™s
keep
but
held
it
less
than
a
fortnight
before
Gregor
Clegane
descended
on
them
and
put
the
whole
garrison
to
the
sword,
even
their
lord.вЂќ

Catelyn
was
horrorstruck.
вЂњDarry
was
only
a
child.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
and
the
last
of
his
line
as
well.
The
boy
would
have
brought
a
fine
ransom,
but
what
does
gold
mean
to
a
frothing
dog
like
Gregor
Clegane?
That
beastвЂ™s
head
would
make
a
noble
gift
for
all
the
people
of
the
realm,
I
vow.вЂќ

Catelyn
knew
Ser
GregorвЂ™s
evil
reputation,
yet
stillвЂ¦вЂњDonвЂ™t
speak
to
me
of
heads,
Uncle.
Cersei
has
mounted
NedвЂ™s
on
a
spike
above
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
and
left
it
for
the
crows
and
flies.вЂќ
Even
now,
it
was
hard
for
her
to
believe
that
he
was
truly
gone.
Some
nights
she
would
wake
in
darkness,
half-asleep,
and
for
an
instant
expect
to
find
him
there
beside
her.
вЂњClegane
is
no
more
than
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
catspaw.вЂќ
For
Tywin
LannisterвЂ”Lord
of
Casterly
Rock,
Warden
of
the
West,
father
to
Queen
Cersei,
Ser
Jaime
the
Kingslayer,
and
Tyrion
the
Imp,
and
grandfather
to
Joffrey
Baratheon,
the
new-crowned
boy
kingвЂ”was
the
true
danger,
Catelyn
believed.

вЂњTrue
enough,вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
admitted.
вЂњAnd
Tywin
Lannister
is
no
manвЂ™s
fool.
He
sits
safe
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal,
feeding
his
host
on
our
harvest
and
burning
what
he
does
not
take.
Gregor
is
not
the
only
dog
heвЂ™s
loosed.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
is
in
the
field
as
well,
and
some
sellsword
out
of
Qohor
whoвЂ™d
sooner
maim
a
man
than
kill
him.
IвЂ™ve
seen
what
they
leave
behind
them.
Whole
villages
put
to
the
torch,
women
raped
and
mutilated,
butchered
children
left
unburied
to
draw
wolves
and
wild
dogsвЂ¦
it
would
sicken
even
the
dead.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
Edmure
hears
this,
he
will
rage.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
that
will
be
just
as
Lord
Tywin
desires.
Even
terror
has
its
purpose,
Cat.
Lannister
wants
to
provoke
us
to
battle.вЂќ

вЂњRobb
is
like
to
give
him
that
wish,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
fretful.
вЂњHe
is
restless
as
a
cat
sitting
here,
and
Edmure
and
the
Greatjon
and
the
others
will
urge
him
on.вЂќ
Her
son
had
won
two
great
victories,
smashing
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
Whispering
Wood
and
routing
his
leaderless
host
outside
the
walls
of
Riverrun
in
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
but
from
the
way
some
of
his
bannermen
spoke
of
him,
he
might
have
been
Aegon
the
Conqueror
reborn.

Brynden
Blackfish
arched
a
bushy
grey
eyebrow.
вЂњMore
fool
they.
My
first
rule
of
war,
CatвЂ”never
give
the
enemy
his
wish.
Lord
Tywin
would
like
to
fight
on
a
field
of
his
own
choosing.
He
wants
us
to
march
on
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњHarrenhal.вЂќ
Every
child
of
the
Trident
knew
the
tales
told
of
Harrenhal,
the
vast
fortress
that
King
Harren
the
Black
had
raised
beside
the
waters
of
Gods
Eye
three
hundred
years
past,
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
had
been
seven
kingdoms,
and
the
riverlands
were
ruled
by
the
ironmen
from
the
islands.
In
his
pride,
Harren
had
desired
the
highest
hall
and
tallest
towers
in
all
Westeros.
Forty
years
it
had
taken,
rising
like
a
great
shadow
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
while
HarrenвЂ™s
armies
plundered
his
neighbors
for
stone,
lumber,
gold,
and
workers.
Thousands
of
captives
died
in
his
quarries,
chained
to
his
sledges,
or
laboring
on
his
five
colossal
towers.
Men
froze
by
winter
and
sweltered
in
summer.
Weirwoods
that
had
stood
three
thousand
years
were
cut
down
for
beams
and
rafters.
Harren
had
beggared
the
riverlands
and
the
Iron
Islands
alike
to
ornament
his
dream.
And
when
at
last
Harrenhal
stood
complete,
on
the
very
day
King
Harren
took
up
residence,
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
come
ashore
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.

Catelyn
could
remember
hearing
Old
Nan
tell
the
story
to
her
own
children,
back
at
Winterfell.
вЂњAnd
King
Harren
learned
that
thick
walls
and
high
towers
are
small
use
against
dragons,вЂќ
the
tale
always
ended.
вЂњFor
dragons
fly.вЂќ
Harren
and
all
his
line
had
perished
in
the
fires
that
engulfed
his
monstrous
fortress,
and
every
house
that
held
Harrenhal
since
had
come
to
misfortune.
Strong
it
might
be,
but
it
was
a
dark
place,
and
cursed.

вЂњI
would
not
have
Robb
fight
a
battle
in
the
shadow
of
that
keep,вЂќ
Catelyn
admitted.
вЂњYet
we
must
do
something,
Uncle.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
soon,вЂќ
her
uncle
agreed.
вЂњI
have
not
told
you
the
worst
of
it,
child.
The
men
I
sent
west
have
brought
back
word
that
a
new
host
is
gathering
at
Casterly
Rock.вЂќ

Another
Lannister
army.
The
thought
made
her
ill.
вЂњRobb
must
be
told
at
once.
Who
will
command?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Stafford
Lannister,
itвЂ™s
said.вЂќ
He
turned
to
gaze
out
over
the
rivers,
his
red-and-blue
cloak
stirring
in
the
breeze.

вЂњAnother
nephew?вЂќ
The
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock
were
a
damnably
large
and
fertile
house.

вЂњCousin,вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
corrected.
вЂњBrother
to
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
late
wife,
so
twice
related.
An
old
man
and
a
bit
of
a
dullard,
but
he
has
a
son,
Ser
Daven,
who
is
more
formidable.вЂќ

вЂњThen
let
us
hope
it
is
the
father
and
not
the
son
who
takes
this
army
into
the
field.вЂќ

вЂњWe
have
some
time
yet
before
we
must
face
them.
This
lot
will
be
sellswords,
freeriders,
and
green
boys
from
the
stews
of
Lannisport.
Ser
Stafford
must
see
that
they
are
armed
and
drilled
before
he
dare
risk
battleвЂ¦
and
make
no
mistake,
Lord
Tywin
is
not
the
Kingslayer.
He
will
not
rush
in
heedless.
He
will
wait
patiently
for
Ser
Stafford
to
march
before
he
stirs
from
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњUnlessвЂ¦вЂќ
said
Catelyn.

вЂњYes?вЂќ
Ser
Brynden
prompted.

вЂњUnless
he
must
leave
Harrenhal,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњto
face
some
other
threat.вЂќ

Her
uncle
looked
at
her
thoughtfully.
вЂњLord
Renly.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Renly.вЂќ
If
she
would
ask
help
from
the
man,
she
would
need
to
grant
him
the
style
he
had
claimed
for
himself.

вЂњPerhaps.вЂќ
The
Blackfish
smiled
a
dangerous
smile.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
want
something,
though.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™ll
want
what
kings
always
want,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњHomage.вЂќ





TYRION

Janos
Slynt
was
a
butcherвЂ™s
son,
and
he
laughed
like
a
man
chopping
meat.
вЂњMore
wine?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked
him.

вЂњI
should
not
object,вЂќ
Lord
Janos
said,
holding
out
his
cup.
He
was
built
like
a
keg,
and
had
a
similar
capacity.
вЂњI
should
not
object
at
all.
ThatвЂ™s
a
fine
red.
From
the
Arbor?вЂќ

вЂњDornish.вЂќ
Tyrion
gestured,
and
his
serving
man
poured.
But
for
the
servants,
he
and
Lord
Janos
were
alone
in
the
Small
Hall,
at
a
small
candlelit
table
surrounded
by
darkness.
вЂњQuite
the
find.
Dornish
wines
are
not
often
so
rich.вЂќ

вЂњRich,вЂќ
said
the
big
frog-faced
man,
taking
a
healthy
gulp.
He
was
not
a
man
for
sipping,
Janos
Slynt.
Tyrion
had
made
note
of
that
at
once.
вЂњYes,
rich,
thatвЂ™s
the
very
word
I
was
searching
for,
the
very
word.
You
have
a
gift
for
words,
Lord
Tyrion,
if
I
might
say
so.
And
you
tell
a
droll
tale.
Droll,
yes.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
pleased
you
think
soвЂ¦
but
IвЂ™m
not
a
lord,
as
you
are.
A
simple
Tyrion
will
suffice
for
me,
Lord
Janos.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
wish.вЂќ
He
took
another
swallow,
dribbling
wine
on
the
front
of
his
black
satin
doublet.
He
was
wearing
a
cloth-of-gold
half
cape
fastened
with
a
miniature
spear,
its
point
enameled
in
dark
red.
And
he
was
well
and
truly
drunk.

Tyrion
covered
his
mouth
and
belched
politely.
Unlike
Lord
Janos
he
had
gone
easy
on
the
wine,
but
he
was
very
full.
The
first
thing
he
had
done
after
taking
up
residence
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
was
inquire
after
the
finest
cook
in
the
city
and
take
her
into
his
service.
This
evening
they
had
supped
on
oxtail
soup,
summer
greens
tossed
with
pecans,
grapes,
red
fennel,
and
crumbled
cheese,
hot
crab
pie,
spiced
squash,
and
quails
drowned
in
butter.
Each
dish
had
come
with
its
own
wine.
Lord
Janos
allowed
that
he
had
never
eaten
half
so
well.
вЂњNo
doubt
that
will
change
when
you
take
your
seat
in
Harrenhal,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.

вЂњFor
a
certainty.
Perhaps
I
should
ask
this
cook
of
yours
to
enter
my
service,
what
do
you
say?вЂќ

вЂњWars
have
been
fought
over
less,вЂќ
he
said,
and
they
both
had
a
good
long
laugh.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
a
bold
man
to
take
Harrenhal
for
your
seat.
Such
a
grim
place,
and
hugeвЂ¦
costly
to
maintain.
And
some
say
cursed
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњShould
I
fear
a
pile
of
stone?вЂќ
He
hooted
at
the
notion.
вЂњA
bold
man,
you
said.
You
must
be
bold,
to
rise.
As
I
have.
To
Harrenhal,
yes!
And
why
not?
You
know.
You
are
a
bold
man
too,
I
sense.
Small,
mayhap,
but
bold.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
too
kind.
More
wine?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
No,
truly,
IвЂ¦
oh,
gods
be
damned,
yes.
Why
not?
A
bold
man
drinks
his
fill!вЂќ

вЂњTruly.вЂќ
Tyrion
filled
Lord
SlyntвЂ™s
cup
to
the
brim.
вЂњI
have
been
glancing
over
the
names
you
put
forward
to
take
your
place
as
Commander
of
the
City
Watch.вЂќ

вЂњGood
men.
Fine
men.
Any
of
the
six
will
do,
but
IвЂ™d
choose
Allar
Deem.
My
right
arm.
Good
good
man.
Loyal.
Pick
him
and
you
wonвЂ™t
be
sorry.
If
he
pleases
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњTo
be
sure.вЂќ
Tyrion
took
a
small
sip
of
his
own
wine.
вЂњI
had
been
considering
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater.
HeвЂ™s
been
captain
on
the
Mud
Gate
for
three
years,
and
he
served
with
valor
during
Balon
GreyjoyвЂ™s
Rebellion.
King
Robert
knighted
him
at
Pyke.
And
yet
his
name
does
not
appear
on
your
list.вЂќ

Lord
Janos
Slynt
took
a
gulp
of
wine
and
sloshed
it
around
in
his
mouth
for
a
moment
before
swallowing.
вЂњBywater.
Well.
Brave
man,
to
be
sure,
yetвЂ¦
heвЂ™s
rigid,
that
one.
A
queer
dog.
The
men
donвЂ™t
like
him.
A
cripple
too,
lost
his
hand
at
Pyke,
thatвЂ™s
what
got
him
knighted.
A
poor
trade,
if
you
ask
me,
a
hand
for
a
ser.вЂќ
He
laughed.
вЂњSer
Jacelyn
thinks
overmuch
of
himself
and
his
honor,
as
I
see
it.
YouвЂ™ll
do
better
leaving
that
one
where
he
is,
my
lorвЂ”Tyrion.
Allar
DeemвЂ™s
the
man
for
you.вЂќ

вЂњDeem
is
little
loved
in
the
streets,
I
am
told.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
feared.
ThatвЂ™s
better.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
was
it
I
heard
of
him?
Some
trouble
in
a
brothel?вЂќ

вЂњThat.
Not
his
fault,
my
lorвЂ”Tyrion.
No.
He
never
meant
to
kill
the
woman,
that
was
her
own
doing.
He
warned
her
to
stand
aside
and
let
him
do
his
duty.вЂќ

вЂњStillвЂ¦
mothers
and
children,
he
might
have
expected
sheвЂ™d
try
to
save
the
babe.вЂќ
Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњHave
some
of
this
cheese,
it
goes
splendidly
with
the
wine.
Tell
me,
why
did
you
choose
Deem
for
that
unhappy
task?вЂќ

вЂњA
good
commander
knows
his
men,
Tyrion.
Some
are
good
for
one
job,
some
for
another.
Doing
for
a
babe,
and
her
still
on
the
tit,
that
takes
a
certain
sort.
Not
every
manвЂ™d
do
it.
Even
if
it
was
only
some
whore
and
her
whelp.вЂќ

вЂњI
suppose
thatвЂ™s
so,вЂќ
said
Tyrion,
hearing
only
some
whore
and
thinking
of
Shae,
and
Tysha
long
ago,
and
all
the
other
women
who
had
taken
his
coin
and
his
seed
over
the
years.

Slynt
went
on,
oblivious.
вЂњA
hard
man
for
a
hard
job,
is
Deem.
Does
as
heвЂ™s
told,
and
never
a
word
afterward.вЂќ
He
cut
a
slice
off
the
cheese.
вЂњThis
is
fine.
Sharp.
Give
me
a
good
sharp
knife
and
a
good
sharp
cheese
and
IвЂ™m
a
happy
man.вЂќ

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњEnjoy
it
while
you
can.
With
the
riverlands
in
flame
and
Renly
king
in
Highgarden,
good
cheese
will
soon
be
hard
to
come
by.
So
who
sent
you
after
the
whoreвЂ™s
bastard?вЂќ

Lord
Janos
gave
Tyrion
a
wary
look,
then
laughed
and
wagged
a
wedge
of
cheese
at
him.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
a
sly
one,
Tyrion.
Thought
you
could
trick
me,
did
you?
it
takes
more
than
wine
and
cheese
to
make
Janos
Slynt
tell
more
than
he
should.
I
pride
myself.
Never
a
question,
and
never
a
word
afterward,
not
with
me.вЂќ

вЂњAs
with
Deem.вЂќ

вЂњJust
the
same.
You
make
him
your
Commander
when
IвЂ™m
off
to
Harrenhal,
and
you
wonвЂ™t
regret
it.вЂќ

Tyrion
broke
off
a
nibble
of
the
cheese.
It
was
sharp
indeed,
and
veined
with
wine;
very
choice.
вЂњWhoever
the
king
names
will
not
have
an
easy
time
stepping
into
your
armor,
I
can
tell.
Lord
Mormont
faces
the
same
problem.вЂќ

Lord
Janos
looked
puzzled.
вЂњI
thought
she
was
a
lady.
Mormont.
Beds
down
with
bears,
thatвЂ™s
the
one?вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
her
brother
I
was
speaking
of.
Jeor
Mormont,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.
When
I
was
visiting
with
him
on
the
Wall,
he
mentioned
how
concerned
he
was
about
finding
a
good
man
to
take
his
place.
The
Watch
gets
so
few
good
men
these
days.вЂќ
Tyrion
grinned.
вЂњHeвЂ™d
sleep
easier
if
he
had
a
man
like
you,
I
imagine.
Or
the
valiant
Allar
Deem.вЂќ

Lord
Janos
roared.
вЂњSmall
chance
of
that!вЂќ

вЂњOne
would
think,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
вЂњbut
life
does
take
queer
turns.
Consider
Eddard
Stark,
my
lord.
I
donвЂ™t
suppose
he
ever
imagined
his
life
would
end
on
the
steps
of
BaelorвЂ™s
Sept.вЂќ

вЂњThere
were
damn
few
as
did,вЂќ
Lord
Janos
allowed,
chuckling.

Tyrion
chuckled
too.
вЂњA
pity
I
wasnвЂ™t
here
to
see
it.
They
say
even
Varys
was
surprised.вЂќ

Lord
Janos
laughed
so
hard
his
gut
shook.
вЂњThe
Spider,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњKnows
everything,
they
say.
Well,
he
didnвЂ™t
know
that.вЂќ

вЂњHow
could
he?вЂќ
Tyrion
put
the
first
hint
of
a
chill
in
his
tone.
вЂњHe
had
helped
persuade
my
sister
that
Stark
should
be
pardoned,
on
the
condition
that
he
take
the
black.вЂќ

вЂњEh?вЂќ
Janos
Slynt
blinked
vaguely
at
Tyrion.

вЂњMy
sister
Cersei,вЂќ
Tyrion
repeated,
a
shade
more
strongly,
in
case
the
fool
had
some
doubt
who
he
meant.
вЂњThe
Queen
Regent.вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
Slynt
took
a
swallow.
вЂњAs
to
that,
wellвЂ¦
the
king
commanded
it,
mвЂ™lord.
The
king
himself.вЂќ

вЂњThe
king
is
thirteen,вЂќ
Tyrion
reminded
him.

вЂњStill.
He
is
the
king.вЂќ
SlyntвЂ™s
jowls
quivered
when
he
frowned.
вЂњThe
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
one
or
two
of
them,
at
least,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
with
a
sour
smile.
вЂњMight
I
have
a
look
at
your
spear?вЂќ

вЂњMy
spear?вЂќ
Lord
Janos
blinked
in
confusion.

Tyrion
pointed.
вЂњThe
clasp
that
fastens
your
cape.вЂќ

Hesitantly,
Lord
Janos
drew
out
the
ornament
and
handed
it
to
Tyrion.

вЂњWe
have
goldsmiths
in
Lannisport
who
do
better
work,вЂќ
he
opined.
вЂњThe
red
enamel
blood
is
a
shade
much,
if
you
donвЂ™t
mind
my
saying.
Tell
me,
my
lord,
did
you
drive
the
spear
into
the
manвЂ™s
back
yourself,
or
did
you
only
give
the
command?вЂќ

вЂњI
gave
the
command,
and
IвЂ™d
give
it
again.
Lord
Stark
was
a
traitor.вЂќ
The
bald
spot
in
the
middle
of
SlyntвЂ™s
head
was
beet-red,
and
his
cloth-of-gold
cape
had
slithered
off
his
shoulders
onto
the
floor.
вЂњThe
man
tried
to
buy
me.вЂќ

вЂњLittle
dreaming
that
you
had
already
been
sold.вЂќ

Slynt
slammed
down
his
wine
cup.
вЂњAre
you
drunk?
If
you
think
I
will
sit
here
and
have
my
honor
questionedвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWhat
honor
is
that?
I
do
admit,
you
made
a
better
bargain
than
Ser
Jacelyn.
A
lordship
and
a
castle
for
a
spear
thrust
in
the
back,
and
you
didnвЂ™t
even
need
to
thrust
the
spear.вЂќ
He
tossed
the
golden
ornament
back
to
Janos
Slynt.
It
bounced
off
his
chest
and
clattered
to
the
floor
as
the
man
rose.

вЂњI
mislike
the
tone
of
your
voice,
my
loвЂ”Imp.
I
am
the
Lord
of
Harrenhal
and
a
member
of
the
kingвЂ™s
council,
who
are
you
to
chastise
me
like
this?вЂќ

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
sideways.
вЂњI
think
you
know
quite
well
who
I
am.
How
many
sons
do
you
have?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
are
my
sons
to
you,
dwarf?вЂќ

вЂњDwarf?вЂќ
His
anger
flashed.
вЂњYou
should
have
stopped
at
Imp.
I
am
Tyrion
of
House
Lannister,
and
someday,
if
you
have
the
sense
the
gods
gave
a
sea
slug,
you
will
drop
to
your
knees
in
thanks
that
it
was
me
you
had
to
deal
with,
and
not
my
lord
father.
Now,
how
many
sons
do
you
have?вЂќ

Tyrion
could
see
the
sudden
fear
in
Janos
SlyntвЂ™s
eyes.
вЂњThвЂ”three,
mвЂ™lord.
And
a
daughter.
Please,
mвЂ™lordвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњYou
need
not
beg.вЂќ
He
slid
off
his
chair.
вЂњYou
have
my
word,
no
harm
will
come
to
them.
The
younger
boys
will
be
fostered
out
as
squires.
If
they
serve
well
and
loyally,
they
may
be
knights
in
time.
Let
it
never
be
said
that
House
Lannister
does
not
reward
those
who
serve
it.
Your
eldest
son
will
inherit
the
title
Lord
Slynt,
and
this
appalling
sigil
of
yours.вЂќ
He
kicked
at
the
little
golden
spear
and
sent
it
skittering
across
the
floor.
вЂњLands
will
be
found
for
him,
and
he
can
build
a
seat
for
himself.
It
will
not
be
Harrenhal,
but
it
will
be
sufficient.
It
will
be
up
to
him
to
make
a
marriage
for
the
girl.вЂќ

Janos
SlyntвЂ™s
face
had
gone
from
red
to
white.
вЂњWh-whatвЂ¦
what
do
youвЂ¦?вЂќ
His
jowls
were
quivering
like
mounds
of
suet.

вЂњWhat
do
I
mean
to
do
with
you?вЂќ
Tyrion
let
the
oaf
tremble
for
a
moment
before
he
answered.
вЂњThe
carrack
SummerвЂ™s
Dream
sails
on
the
morning
tide.
Her
master
tells
me
she
will
call
at
Gulltown,
the
Three
Sisters,
the
isle
of
Skagos,
and
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
When
you
see
Lord
Commander
Mormont,
give
him
my
fond
regards,
and
tell
him
that
I
have
not
forgotten
the
needs
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.
I
wish
you
long
life
and
good
service,
my
lord.вЂќ

Once
Janos
Slynt
realized
he
was
not
to
be
summarily
executed,
color
returned
to
his
face.
He
thrust
his
jaw
out.
вЂњWe
will
see
about
this,
Imp.
Dwarf.
Perhaps
it
will
be
you
on
that
ship,
what
do
you
think
of
that?
Perhaps
it
will
be
you
on
the
Wall.вЂќ
He
gave
a
bark
of
anxious
laughter.
вЂњYou
and
your
threats,
well,
we
will
see.
I
am
the
kingвЂ™s
friend,
you
know.
We
shall
hear
what
Joffrey
has
to
say
about
this.
And
Littlefinger
and
the
queen,
oh,
yes.
Janos
Slynt
has
a
good
many
friends.
We
will
see
who
goes
sailing,
I
promise
you.
Indeed
we
will.вЂќ

Slynt
spun
on
his
heel
like
the
watchman
heвЂ™d
once
been,
and
strode
the
length
of
the
Small
Hall,
boots
ringing
on
the
stone.
He
clattered
up
the
steps,
threw
open
the
doorвЂ¦
and
came
face-to-face
with
a
tall,
lantern-jawed
man
in
black
breastplate
and
gold
cloak.
Strapped
to
the
stump
of
his
right
wrist
was
an
iron
hand.
вЂњJanos,вЂќ
he
said,
deep-set
eyes
glinting
under
a
prominent
brow
ridge
and
a
shock
of
salt-and-pepper
hair.
Six
gold
cloaks
moved
quietly
into
the
Small
Hall
behind
him
as
Janos
Slynt
backed
away.

вЂњLord
Slynt,вЂќ
Tyrion
called
out,
вЂњI
believe
you
know
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater,
our
new
Commander
of
the
City
Watch.вЂќ

вЂњWe
have
a
litter
waiting
for
you,
my
lord,вЂќ
Ser
Jacelyn
told
Slynt.
вЂњThe
docks
are
dark
and
distant,
and
the
streets
are
not
safe
by
night.
Men.вЂќ

As
the
gold
cloaks
ushered
out
their
onetime
commander,
Tyrion
called
Ser
Jacelyn
to
his
side
and
handed
him
a
roll
of
parchment.
вЂњItвЂ™s
a
long
voyage,
and
Lord
Slynt
will
want
for
company.
See
that
these
six
join
him
on
the
SummerвЂ™s
Dream.вЂќ

Bywater
glanced
over
the
names
and
smiled.
вЂњAs
you
will.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
one,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
quietly.
вЂњDeem.
Tell
the
captain
it
would
not
be
taken
amiss
if
that
one
should
happen
to
be
swept
overboard
before
they
reach
Eastwatch.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
told
those
northern
waters
are
very
stormy,
my
lord.вЂќ
Ser
Jacelyn
bowed
and
took
his
leave,
his
cloak
rippling
behind
him.
He
trod
on
SlyntвЂ™s
cloth-of-gold
cape
on
his
way.

Tyrion
sat
alone,
sipping
at
what
remained
of
the
fine
sweet
Dornish
wine.
Servants
came
and
went,
clearing
the
dishes
from
the
table.
He
told
them
to
leave
the
wine.
When
they
were
done,
Varys
came
gliding
into
the
hall,
wearing
flowing
lavender
robes
that
matched
his
smell.
вЂњOh
sweetly
done,
my
good
lord.вЂќ

вЂњThen
why
do
I
have
this
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth?вЂќ
He
pressed
his
fingers
into
his
temples.
вЂњI
told
them
to
throw
Allar
Deem
into
the
sea.
I
am
sorely
tempted
to
do
the
same
with
you.вЂќ

вЂњYou
might
be
disappointed
by
the
result,вЂќ
Varys
replied.
вЂњThe
storms
come
and
go,
the
waves
crash
overhead,
the
big
fish
eat
the
little
fish,
and
I
keep
on
paddling.
Might
I
trouble
you
for
a
taste
of
the
wine
that
Lord
Slynt
enjoyed
so
much?вЂќ

Tyrion
waved
at
the
flagon,
frowning.

Varys
filled
a
cup.
вЂњAh.
Sweet
as
summer.вЂќ
He
took
another
sip.
вЂњI
hear
the
grapes
singing
on
my
tongue.вЂќ

вЂњI
wondered
what
that
noise
was.
Tell
the
grapes
to
keep
still,
my
head
is
about
to
split.
It
was
my
sister.
That
was
what
the
oh-so-loyal
Lord
Janos
refused
to
say.
Cersei
sent
the
gold
cloaks
to
that
brothel.вЂќ

Varys
tittered
nervously.
So
he
had
known
all
along.

вЂњYou
left
that
part
out,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
accusingly.

вЂњYour
own
sweet
sister,вЂќ
Varys
said,
so
grief-stricken
he
looked
close
to
tears.
вЂњIt
is
a
hard
thing
to
tell
a
man,
my
lord.
I
was
fearful
how
you
might
take
it.
Can
you
forgive
me?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Tyrion
snapped.
вЂњDamn
you.
Damn
her.вЂќ
He
could
not
touch
Cersei,
he
knew.
Not
yet,
not
even
if
heвЂ™d
wanted
to,
and
he
was
far
from
certain
that
he
did.
Yet
it
rankled,
to
sit
here
and
make
a
mummerвЂ™s
show
of
justice
by
punishing
the
sorry
likes
of
Janos
Slynt
and
Allar
Deem,
while
his
sister
continued
on
her
savage
course.
вЂњIn
future,
you
will
tell
me
what
you
know,
Lord
Varys.
All
of
what
you
know.вЂќ

The
eunuchвЂ™s
smile
was
sly.
вЂњThat
might
take
rather
a
long
time,
my
good
lord.
I
know
quite
a
lot.вЂќ

вЂњNot
enough
to
save
this
child,
it
would
seem.вЂќ

вЂњAlas,
no.
There
was
another
bastard,
a
boy,
older.
I
took
steps
to
see
him
removed
from
harmвЂ™s
wayвЂ¦
but
I
confess,
I
never
dreamed
the
babe
would
be
at
risk.
A
baseborn
girl,
less
than
a
year
old,
with
a
whore
for
a
mother.
What
threat
could
she
pose?вЂќ

вЂњShe
was
RobertвЂ™s,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
bitterly.
вЂњThat
was
enough
for
Cersei,
it
would
seem.вЂќ

вЂњYes.
It
is
grievous
sad.
I
must
blame
myself
for
the
poor
sweet
babe
and
her
mother,
who
was
so
young
and
loved
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњDid
she?вЂќ
Tyrion
had
never
seen
the
dead
girlвЂ™s
face,
but
in
his
mind
she
was
Shae
and
Tysha
both.
вЂњCan
a
whore
truly
love
anyone,
I
wonder?
No,
donвЂ™t
answer.
Some
things
I
would
rather
not
know.вЂќ
He
had
settled
Shae
in
a
sprawling
stone-and-timber
manse,
with
its
own
well
and
stable
and
garden;
he
had
given
her
servants
to
see
to
her
wants,
a
white
bird
from
the
Summer
Isles
to
keep
her
company,
silks
and
silver
and
gemstones
to
adorn
her,
guards
to
protect
her.
And
yet
she
seemed
restive.
She
wanted
to
be
with
him
more,
she
told
him;
she
wanted
to
serve
him
and
help
him.
вЂњYou
help
me
most
here,
between
the
sheets,вЂќ
he
told
her
one
night
after
their
loving
as
he
lay
beside
her,
his
head
pillowed
against
her
breast,
his
groin
aching
with
a
sweet
soreness.
She
made
no
reply,
save
with
her
eyes.
He
could
see
there
that
it
was
not
what
sheвЂ™d
wanted
to
hear.

Sighing,
Tyrion
started
to
reach
for
the
wine
again,
then
remembered
Lord
Janos
and
pushed
the
flagon
away.
вЂњIt
does
seem
my
sister
was
telling
the
truth
about
StarkвЂ™s
death.
We
have
my
nephew
to
thank
for
that
madness.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Joffrey
gave
the
command.
Janos
Slynt
and
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
carried
it
out,
swiftly,
without
hesitationвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦almost
as
if
they
had
expected
it.
Yes,
we
have
been
over
this
ground
before,
without
profit.
A
folly.вЂќ

вЂњWith
the
City
Watch
in
hand,
my
lord,
you
are
well
placed
to
see
to
it
that
His
Grace
commits
no
furtherвЂ¦
follies?
To
be
sure,
there
is
still
the
queenвЂ™s
household
guard
to
considerвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
red
cloaks?вЂќ
Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњVylarrвЂ™s
loyalty
is
to
Casterly
Rock.
He
knows
I
am
here
with
my
fatherвЂ™s
authority.
Cersei
would
find
it
hard
to
use
his
men
against
meвЂ¦
besides,
they
are
only
a
hundred.
I
have
half
again
as
many
men
of
my
own.
And
six
thousand
gold
cloaks,
if
Bywater
is
the
man
you
claim.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
find
Ser
Jacelyn
to
be
courageous,
honorable,
obedientвЂ¦
and
most
grateful.вЂќ

вЂњTo
whom,
I
wonder?вЂќ
Tyrion
did
not
trust
Varys,
though
there
was
no
denying
his
value.
He
knew
things,
beyond
a
doubt.
вЂњWhy
are
you
so
helpful,
my
lord
Varys?вЂќ
he
asked,
studying
the
manвЂ™s
soft
hands,
the
bald
powdered
face,
the
slimy
little
smile.

вЂњYou
are
the
Hand.
I
serve
the
realm,
the
king,
and
you.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
served
Jon
Arryn
and
Eddard
Stark?вЂќ

вЂњI
served
Lord
Arryn
and
Lord
Stark
as
best
I
could.
I
was
saddened
and
horrified
by
their
most
untimely
deaths.вЂќ

вЂњThink
how
I
feel.
IвЂ™m
like
to
be
next.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
think
not,вЂќ
Varys
said,
swirling
the
wine
in
his
cup.
вЂњPower
is
a
curious
thing,
my
lord.
Perchance
you
have
considered
the
riddle
I
posed
you
that
day
in
the
inn?вЂќ

вЂњIt
has
crossed
my
mind
a
time
or
two,вЂќ
Tyrion
admitted.
вЂњThe
king,
the
priest,
the
rich
manвЂ”who
lives
and
who
dies?
Who
will
the
swordsman
obey?
ItвЂ™s
a
riddle
without
an
answer,
or
rather,
too
many
answers.
All
depends
on
the
man
with
the
sword.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
yet
he
is
no
one,вЂќ
Varys
said.
вЂњHe
has
neither
crown
nor
gold
nor
favor
of
the
gods,
only
a
piece
of
pointed
steel.вЂќ

вЂњThat
piece
of
steel
is
the
power
of
life
and
death.вЂќ

вЂњJust
soвЂ¦
yet
if
it
is
the
swordsmen
who
rule
us
in
truth,
why
do
we
pretend
our
kings
hold
the
power?
Why
should
a
strong
man
with
a
sword
ever
obey
a
child
king
like
Joffrey,
or
a
wine-sodden
oaf
like
his
father?
вЂњ

вЂњBecause
these
child
kings
and
drunken
oafs
can
call
other
strong
men,
with
other
swords.вЂќ

вЂњThen
these
other
swordsmen
have
the
true
power.
Or
do
they?
Whence
came
their
swords?
Why
do
they
obey?вЂќ
Varys
smiled.
вЂњSome
say
knowledge
is
power.
Some
tell
us
that
all
power
comes
from
the
gods.
Others
say
it
derives
from
law.
Yet
that
day
on
the
steps
of
BaelorвЂ™s
Sept,
our
godly
High
Septon
and
the
lawful
Queen
Regent
and
your
ever-so-knowledgeable
servant
were
as
powerless
as
any
cobbler
or
cooper
in
the
crowd.
Who
truly
killed
Eddard
Stark
do
you
think?
Joffrey,
who
gave
the
command?
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
who
swung
the
sword?
OrвЂ¦
another?
вЂњ

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
sideways.
вЂњDid
you
mean
to
answer
your
damned
riddle,
or
only
to
make
my
head
ache
worse?вЂќ

Varys
smiled.
вЂњHere,
then.
Power
resides
where
men
believe
it
resides.
No
more
and
no
less.вЂќ

вЂњSo
power
is
a
mummerвЂ™s
trick?вЂќ

вЂњA
shadow
on
the
wall,вЂќ
Varys
murmured,
вЂњyet
shadows
can
kill.
And
ofttimes
a
very
small
man
can
cast
a
very
large
shadow.вЂќ

Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњLord
Varys,
I
am
growing
strangely
fond
of
you.
I
may
kill
you
yet,
but
I
think
IвЂ™d
feel
sad
about
it.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
take
that
as
high
praise.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
are
you,
Varys?вЂќ
Tyrion
found
he
truly
wanted
to
know.
вЂњA
spider,
they
say.вЂќ

вЂњSpies
and
informers
are
seldom
loved,
my
lord.
I
am
but
a
loyal
servant
of
the
realm.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
eunuch.
Let
us
not
forget
that.вЂќ

вЂњI
seldom
do.вЂќ

вЂњPeople
have
called
me
a
halfman
too,
yet
I
think
the
gods
have
been
kinder
to
me.
I
am
small,
my
legs
are
twisted,
and
women
do
not
look
upon
me
with
any
great
yearningвЂ¦
yet
IвЂ™m
still
a
man.
Shae
is
not
the
first
to
grace
my
bed,
and
one
day
I
may
take
a
wife
and
sire
a
son.
If
the
gods
are
good,
heвЂ™ll
look
like
his
uncle
and
think
like
his
father.
You
have
no
such
hope
to
sustain
you.
Dwarfs
are
a
jape
of
the
godsвЂ¦
but
men
make
eunuchs.
Who
cut
you,
Varys?
When
and
why?
Who
are
you,
truly?вЂќ

The
eunuchвЂ™s
smile
never
flickered,
but
his
eyes
glittered
with
something
that
was
not
laughter.
вЂњYou
are
kind
to
ask,
my
lord,
but
my
tale
is
long
and
sad,
and
we
have
treasons
to
discuss.вЂќ
He
drew
a
parchment
from
the
sleeve
of
his
robe.
вЂњThe
master
of
the
KingвЂ™s
Galley
White
Hart
plots
to
slip
anchor
three
days
hence
to
offer
his
sword
and
ship
to
Lord
Stannis.вЂќ

Tyrion
sighed.
вЂњI
suppose
we
must
make
some
sort
of
bloody
lesson
out
of
the
man?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Jacelyn
could
arrange
for
him
to
vanish,
but
a
trial
before
the
king
would
help
assure
the
continued
loyalty
of
the
other
captains.вЂќ

And
keep
my
royal
nephew
occupied
as
well.
вЂњAs
you
say.
Put
him
down
for
a
dose
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
justice.вЂќ

Varys
made
a
mark
on
the
parchment.
вЂњSer
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber
Redwyne
have
bribed
a
guard
to
let
them
out
a
postern
gate,
the
night
after
next.
Arrangements
have
been
made
for
them
to
sail
on
the
Pentoshi
galley
Moonrunner,
disguised
as
oarsmen.вЂќ

вЂњCan
we
keep
them
on
those
oars
for
a
few
years,
see
how
they
fancy
it?вЂќ
He
smiled.
вЂњNo,
my
sister
would
be
distraught
to
lose
such
treasured
guests.
Inform
Ser
Jacelyn.
Seize
the
man
they
bribed
and
explain
what
an
honor
it
is
to
serve
as
a
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.
And
have
men
posted
around
the
Moonrunner,
in
case
the
Redwynes
find
a
second
guard
short
of
coin.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.вЂќ
Another
mark
on
the
parchment.
вЂњYour
man
Timett
slew
a
winesellerвЂ™s
son
this
evening,
at
a
gambling
den
on
the
Street
of
Silver.
He
accused
him
of
cheating
at
tiles.вЂќ

вЂњWas
it
true?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
beyond
a
doubt.вЂќ

вЂњThen
the
honest
men
of
the
city
owe
Timett
a
debt
of
gratitude.
I
shall
see
that
he
has
the
kingвЂ™s
thanks.вЂќ

The
eunuch
gave
a
nervous
giggle
and
made
another
mark.
вЂњWe
also
have
a
sudden
plague
of
holy
men.
The
comet
has
brought
forth
all
manner
of
queer
priests,
preachers,
and
prophets,
it
would
seem.
They
beg
in
the
winesinks
and
pot-shops
and
foretell
doom
and
destruction
to
anyone
who
stops
to
listen.вЂќ

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњWe
are
close
on
the
three
hundredth
year
since
AegonвЂ™s
Landing,
I
suppose
it
is
only
to
be
expected.
Let
them
rant.вЂќ

вЂњThey
are
spreading
fear,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњI
thought
that
was
your
job.вЂќ

Varys
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand.
вЂњYou
are
very
cruel
to
say
so.
One
last
matter.
Lady
Tanda
gave
a
small
supper
last
night.
I
have
the
menu
and
the
guest
list
for
your
inspection.
When
the
wine
was
poured,
Lord
Gyles
rose
to
lift
a
cup
to
the
king,
and
Ser
Balon
Swann
was
heard
to
remark,
вЂWeвЂ™ll
need
three
cups
for
that.вЂ™
Many
laughedвЂ¦вЂќ

Tyrion
raised
a
hand.
вЂњEnough.
Ser
Balon
made
a
jest.
I
am
not
interested
in
treasonous
table
talk,
Lord
Varys.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
as
wise
as
you
are
gentle,
my
lord.вЂќ
The
parchment
vanished
up
the
eunuchвЂ™s
sleeve.
вЂњWe
both
have
much
to
do.
I
shall
leave
you.вЂќ

When
the
eunuch
had
departed,
Tyrion
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
candle
and
wondering
how
his
sister
would
take
the
news
of
Janos
SlyntвЂ™s
dismissal.
Not
happily,
if
he
was
any
judge,
but
beyond
sending
an
angry
protest
to
Lord
Tywin
in
Harrenhal,
he
did
not
see
what
Cersei
could
hope
to
do
about
it.
Tyrion
had
the
City
Watch
now,
plus
a
hundred-and-a-half
fierce
clansmen
and
a
growing
force
of
sellswords
recruited
by
Bronn.
He
would
seem
well
protected.

Doubtless
Eddard
Stark
thought
the
same.

The
Red
Keep
was
dark
and
still
when
Tyrion
left
the
Small
Hall.
Bronn
was
waiting
in
his
solar.
вЂњSlynt?вЂќ
he
asked.

вЂњLord
Janos
will
be
sailing
for
the
Wall
on
the
morning
tide.
Varys
would
have
me
believe
that
I
have
replaced
one
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
men
with
one
of
my
own.
More
likely,
I
have
replaced
LittlefingerвЂ™s
man
with
one
belonging
to
Varys,
but
so
be
it.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
best
know,
Timett
killed
a
manвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњVarys
told
me.вЂќ

The
sellsword
seemed
unsurprised.
вЂњThe
fool
figured
a
one-eyed
man
would
be
easier
to
cheat.
Timett
pinned
his
wrist
to
the
table
with
a
dagger
and
ripped
out
his
throat
barehanded.
He
has
this
trick
where
he
stiffens
his
fingersвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSpare
me
the
grisly
details,
my
supper
is
sitting
badly
in
my
belly,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњHow
goes
your
recruiting?вЂќ

вЂњWell
enough.
Three
new
men
tonight.вЂќ

вЂњHow
do
you
know
which
ones
to
hire?вЂќ

вЂњI
look
them
over.
I
question
them,
to
learn
where
theyвЂ™ve
fought
and
how
well
they
lie.вЂќ
Bronn
smiled.
вЂњAnd
then
I
give
them
a
chance
to
kill
me,
while
I
do
the
same
for
them.вЂќ

вЂњHave
you
killed
any?вЂќ

вЂњNo
one
we
could
have
used.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
one
of
them
kills
you?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™ll
be
one
youвЂ™ll
want
to
hire.вЂќ

Tyrion
was
a
little
drunk,
and
very
tired.
вЂњTell
me,
Bronn.
If
I
told
you
to
kill
a
babeвЂ¦
an
infant
girl,
say,
still
at
her
motherвЂ™s
breastвЂ¦
would
you
do
it?
Without
question?вЂќ

вЂњWithout
question?
No.вЂќ
The
sellsword
rubbed
thumb
and
forefinger
together.
вЂњIвЂ™d
ask
how
much.вЂќ

And
why
would
I
ever
need
your
Allar
Deem,
Lord
Slynt?
Tyrion
thought.
I
have
a
hundred
of
my
own.
He
wanted
to
laugh;
he
wanted
to
weep;
most
of
all,
he
wanted
Shae.





ARYA

The
road
was
little
more
than
two
ruts
through
the
weeds.

The
good
part
was,
with
so
little
traffic
thereвЂ™d
be
no
one
to
point
the
finger
and
say
which
way
theyвЂ™d
gone.
The
human
flood
that
had
flowed
down
the
kingsroad
was
only
a
trickle
here.

The
bad
part
was,
the
road
wound
back
and
forth
like
a
snake,
tangling
with
even
smaller
trails
and
sometimes
seeming
to
vanish
entirely
only
to
reappear
half
a
league
farther
on
when
they
had
all
but
given
up
hope.
Arya
hated
it.
The
land
was
gentle
enough,
rolling
hills
and
terraced
fields
interspersed
with
meadows
and
woodlands
and
little
valleys
where
willows
crowded
close
to
slow
shallow
streams.
Even
so,
the
path
was
so
narrow
and
crooked
that
their
pace
had
dropped
to
a
crawl.

It
was
the
wagons
that
slowed
them,
lumbering
along,
axles
creaking
under
the
weight
of
their
heavy
loads.
A
dozen
times
a
day
they
had
to
stop
to
free
a
wheel
that
had
stuck
in
a
rut,
or
double
up
the
teams
to
climb
a
muddy
slope.
Once,
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
stand
of
oak,
they
came
face-to-face
with
three
men
pulling
a
load
of
firewood
in
an
ox
cart,
with
no
way
for
either
to
get
around.
There
had
been
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
while
the
foresters
unhitched
their
ox,
led
him
through
the
trees,
spun
the
cart,
hitched
the
ox
up
again,
and
started
back
the
way
theyвЂ™d
come.
The
ox
was
even
slower
than
the
wagons,
so
that
day
they
hardly
got
anywhere
at
all.

Arya
could
not
help
looking
over
her
shoulder,
wondering
when
the
gold
cloaks
would
catch
them.
At
night,
she
woke
at
every
noise
to
grab
for
NeedleвЂ™s
hilt.
They
never
made
camp
without
putting
out
sentries
now,
but
Arya
did
not
trust
them,
especially
the
orphan
boys.
They
might
have
done
well
enough
in
the
alleys
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
but
out
here
they
were
lost.
When
she
was
being
quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
could
sneak
past
all
of
them,
flitting
out
by
starlight
to
make
her
water
in
the
woods
where
no
one
would
see.
Once,
when
Lommy
Greenhands
had
the
watch,
she
shimmied
up
an
oak
and
moved
from
tree
to
tree
until
she
was
right
above
his
head,
and
he
never
saw
a
thing.
She
would
have
jumped
down
on
top
of
him,
but
she
knew
his
scream
would
wake
the
whole
camp,
and
Yoren
might
take
a
stick
to
her
again.

Lommy
and
the
other
orphans
all
treated
the
Bull
like
someone
special
now
because
the
queen
wanted
his
head,
though
he
would
have
none
of
it.
вЂњI
never
did
nothing
to
no
queen,вЂќ
he
said
angrily.
вЂњI
did
my
work,
is
all.
Bellows
and
tongs
and
fetch
and
carry.
I
was
sвЂ™posed
to
be
an
armorer,
and
one
day
Master
Mott
says
I
got
to
join
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch,
thatвЂ™s
all
I
know.вЂќ
Then
heвЂ™d
go
off
to
polish
his
helm.
It
was
a
beautiful
helm,
rounded
and
curved,
with
a
slit
visor
and
two
great
metal
bullвЂ™s
horns.
Arya
would
watch
him
polish
the
metal
with
an
oilcloth,
shining
it
so
bright
you
could
see
the
flames
of
the
cookfire
reflected
in
the
steel.
Yet
he
never
actually
put
it
on
his
head.

вЂњI
bet
heвЂ™s
that
traitorвЂ™s
bastard,вЂќ
Lommy
said
one
night,
in
a
hushed
voice
so
Gendry
would
not
hear.
вЂњThe
wolf
lord,
the
one
they
nicked
on
BaelorвЂ™s
steps.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
not,вЂќ
Arya
declared.
My
father
only
had
one
bastard,
and
thatвЂ™s
Jon.
She
stalked
off
into
the
trees,
wishing
she
could
just
saddle
her
horse
and
ride
home.
She
was
a
good
horse,
a
chestnut
mare
with
a
white
blaze
on
her
forehead.
And
Arya
had
always
been
a
good
rider.
She
could
gallop
off
and
never
see
any
of
them,
unless
she
wanted
to.
Only
then
sheвЂ™d
have
no
one
to
scout
ahead
of
her,
or
watch
behind,
or
stand
guard
while
she
napped,
and
when
the
gold
cloaks
caught
her,
sheвЂ™d
be
all
alone.
It
was
safer
to
stay
with
Yoren
and
the
others.

вЂњWeвЂ™re
not
far
from
Gods
Eye,вЂќ
the
black
brother
said
one
morning.
вЂњThe
kingsroad
wonвЂ™t
be
safe
till
weвЂ™re
across
the
Trident.
So
weвЂ™ll
come
up
around
the
lake
along
the
western
shore,
theyвЂ™re
not
like
to
look
for
us
there.вЂќ
At
the
next
spot
where
two
ruts
cut
cross
each
other,
he
turned
the
wagons
west.

Here
farmland
gave
way
to
forest,
the
villages
and
holdfasts
were
smaller
and
farther
apart,
the
hills
higher
and
the
valleys
deeper.
Food
grew
harder
to
come
by.
In
the
city,
Yoren
had
loaded
up
the
wagons
with
salt
fish,
hard
bread,
lard,
turnips,
sacks
of
beans
and
barley,
and
wheels
of
yellow
cheese,
but
every
bite
of
it
had
been
eaten.
Forced
to
live
off
the
land,
Yoren
turned
to
Koss
and
Kurz,
whoвЂ™d
been
taken
as
poachers.
He
would
send
them
ahead
of
the
column,
into
the
woods,
and
come
dusk
they
would
be
back
with
a
deer
slung
between
them
on
a
pole
or
a
brace
of
quail
swinging
from
their
belts.
The
younger
boys
would
be
set
to
picking
blackberries
along
the
road,
or
climbing
fences
to
fill
a
sack
with
apples
if
they
happened
upon
an
orchard.

Arya
was
a
skilled
climber
and
a
fast
picker,
and
she
liked
to
go
off
by
herself.
One
day
she
came
across
a
rabbit,
purely
by
happenstance.
It
was
brown
and
fat,
with
long
ears
and
a
twitchy
nose.
Rabbits
ran
faster
than
cats,
but
they
couldnвЂ™t
climb
trees
half
so
well.
She
whacked
it
with
her
stick
and
grabbed
it
by
its
ears,
and
Yoren
stewed
it
with
some
mushrooms
and
wild
onions.
Arya
was
given
a
whole
leg,
since
it
was
her
rabbit.
She
shared
it
with
Gendry.
The
rest
of
them
each
got
a
spoonful,
even
the
three
in
manacles.
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
thanked
her
politely
for
the
treat,
and
Biter
licked
the
grease
off
his
dirty
fingers
with
a
blissful
look,
but
Rorge,
the
noseless
one,
only
laughed
and
said,
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
hunter
now.
Lumpyface
Lumpyhead
Rabbitkiller.вЂќ

Outside
a
holdfast
called
Briarwhite,
some
fieldhands
surrounded
them
in
a
cornfield,
demanding
coin
for
the
ears
theyвЂ™d
taken.
Yoren
eyed
their
scythes
and
tossed
them
a
few
coppers.
вЂњTime
was,
a
man
in
black
was
feasted
from
Dorne
to
Winterfell,
and
even
high
lords
called
it
an
honor
to
shelter
him
under
their
roofs,вЂќ
he
said
bitterly.
вЂњNow
cravens
like
you
want
hard
coin
for
a
bite
of
wormy
apple.вЂќ
He
spat.

вЂњItвЂ™s
sweetcorn,
betterвЂ™n
a
stinking
old
black
bird
like
you
deserves,вЂќ
one
of
them
answered
roughly.
вЂњYou
get
out
of
our
field
now,
and
take
these
sneaks
and
stabbers
with
you,
or
weвЂ™ll
stake
you
up
in
the
corn
to
scare
the
other
crows
away.вЂќ

They
roasted
the
sweetcorn
in
the
husk
that
night,
turning
the
ears
with
long
forked
sticks,
and
ate
it
hot
right
off
the
cob.
Arya
thought
it
tasted
wonderful,
but
Yoren
was
too
angry
to
eat.
A
cloud
seemed
to
hang
over
him,
ragged
and
black
as
his
cloak.
He
paced
about
the
camp
restlessly,
muttering
to
himself.

The
next
day
Koss
came
racing
back
to
warn
Yoren
of
a
camp
ahead.
вЂњTwenty
or
thirty
men,
in
mail
and
halfhelms,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњSome
of
them
are
cut
up
bad,
and
oneвЂ™s
dying,
from
the
sound
of
him.
With
all
the
noise
he
was
making,
I
got
right
up
close.
They
got
spears
and
shields,
but
only
one
horse,
and
thatвЂ™s
lame.
I
think
they
been
there
awhile,
from
the
stink
of
the
place.вЂќ

вЂњSee
a
banner?вЂќ

вЂњSpotted
treecat,
yellow
and
black,
on
a
mud-brown
field.вЂќ

Yoren
folded
a
sourleaf
into
his
mouth
and
chewed.
вЂњCanвЂ™t
say,вЂќ
he
admitted.
вЂњMight
be
one
side,
might
be
tвЂ™other.
If
theyвЂ™re
hurt
that
bad,
likely
theyвЂ™d
take
our
mounts
no
matter
who
they
are.
Might
be
theyвЂ™d
take
more
than
that.
I
believe
weвЂ™ll
go
wide
around
them.вЂќ
It
took
them
miles
out
of
their
way,
and
cost
them
two
days
at
the
least,
but
the
old
man
said
it
was
cheap
at
the
price.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
have
time
enough
on
the
Wall.
The
rest
oвЂ™
your
lives,
most
like.
Seems
to
me
thereвЂ™s
no
rush
to
get
there.
вЂњ

Arya
saw
men
guarding
the
fields
more
and
more
when
they
turned
north
again.
Often
they
stood
silently
beside
the
road,
giving
a
cold
eye
to
anyone
who
passed.
Elsewhere
they
patrolled
on
horses,
riding
their
fence
lines
with
axes
strapped
to
their
saddles.
At
one
place,
she
spotted
a
man
perched
up
in
a
dead
tree,
with
a
bow
in
his
hand
and
a
quiver
hanging
from
the
branch
beside
him.
The
moment
he
spied
them,
he
notched
an
arrow
to
his
bowstring,
and
never
looked
away
until
the
last
wagon
was
out
of
sight.
All
the
while,
Yoren
cursed.
вЂњHim
in
his
tree,
letвЂ™s
see
how
well
he
likes
it
up
there
when
the
Others
come
to
take
him.
HeвЂ™ll
scream
for
the
Watch
then,
that
he
will.вЂќ

A
day
later
Dobber
spied
a
red
glow
against
the
evening
sky.
вЂњEither
this
road
went
and
turned
again,
or
that
sunвЂ™s
setting
in
the
north.вЂќ

Yoren
climbed
a
rise
to
get
a
better
look.
вЂњFire,вЂќ
he
announced.
He
licked
a
thumb
and
held
it
up.
вЂњWind
should
blow
it
away
from
us.
Still
bears
watching.вЂќ

And
watch
it
they
did.
As
the
world
darkened,
the
fire
seemed
to
grow
brighter
and
brighter,
until
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
north
was
ablaze.
From
time
to
time,
they
could
even
smell
the
smoke,
though
the
wind
held
steady
and
the
flames
never
got
any
closer.
By
dawn
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out,
but
none
of
them
slept
very
well
that
night.

It
was
midday
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
village
had
been.
The
fields
were
a
charred
desolation
for
miles
around,
the
houses
blackened
shells.
The
carcasses
of
burnt
and
butchered
animals
dotted
the
ground,
under
living
blankets
of
carrion
crows
that
rose,
cawing
furiously,
when
disturbed.
Smoke
still
drifted
from
inside
the
holdfast.
Its
timber
palisade
looked
strong
from
afar,
but
had
not
proved
strong
enough.

Riding
out
in
front
of
the
wagons
on
her
horse,
Arya
saw
burnt
bodies
impaled
on
sharpened
stakes
atop
the
walls,
their
hands
drawn
up
tight
in
front
of
their
faces
as
if
to
fight
off
the
flames
that
had
consumed
them.
Yoren
called
a
halt
when
they
were
still
some
distance
off,
and
told
Arya
and
the
other
boys
to
guard
the
wagons
while
he
and
Murch
and
Cutjack
went
in
on
foot.
A
flock
of
ravens
rose
from
inside
the
walls
when
they
climbed
through
the
broken
gate,
and
the
caged
ravens
in
their
wagons
called
out
to
them
with
quorks
and
raucous
shrieks.

вЂњShould
we
go
in
after
them?вЂќ
Arya
asked
Gendry
after
Yoren
and
the
others
had
been
gone
a
long
time.

вЂњYoren
said
wait.вЂќ
GendryвЂ™s
voice
sounded
hollow.
When
Arya
turned
to
look,
she
saw
that
he
was
wearing
his
helm,
all
shiny
steel
and
great
curving
horns.

When
they
finally
returned,
Yoren
had
a
little
girl
in
his
arms,
and
Murch
and
Cutjack
were
carrying
a
woman
in
a
sling
made
of
an
old
torn
quilt.
The
girl
was
no
older
than
two
and
she
cried
all
the
time,
a
whimpery
sound,
like
something
was
caught
in
her
throat.
Either
she
couldnвЂ™t
talk
yet
or
she
had
forgotten
how.
The
womanвЂ™s
right
arm
ended
in
a
bloody
stump
at
her
elbow,
and
her
eyes
didnвЂ™t
seem
to
see
anything,
even
when
she
was
looking
right
at
it.
She
talked,
but
she
only
said
one
thing.
вЂњPlease,вЂќ
she
cried,
over
and
over.
вЂњPlease.
Please.вЂќ
Rorge
thought
that
was
funny.
He
laughed
through
the
hole
in
his
face
where
his
nose
had
been,
and
Biter
started
laughing
too,
until
Murch
cursed
them
and
told
them
to
shut
up.

Yoren
had
them
fix
the
woman
a
place
in
the
back
of
a
wagon.
вЂњAnd
be
quick
about
it,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњCome
dark,
thereвЂ™ll
be
wolves
here,
and
worse.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
scared,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
murmured
when
he
saw
the
one-armed
woman
thrashing
in
the
wagon.

вЂњMe
too,вЂќ
Arya
confessed.

He
squeezed
her
shoulder.
вЂњI
never
truly
kicked
no
boy
to
death,
Arry.
I
just
sold
my
mommyвЂ™s
pies,
is
all.вЂќ

Arya
rode
as
far
ahead
of
the
wagons
as
she
dared,
so
she
wouldnвЂ™t
have
to
hear
the
little
girl
crying
or
listen
to
the
woman
whisper,
вЂњPlease.вЂќ
She
remembered
a
story
Old
Nan
had
told
once,
about
a
man
imprisoned
in
a
dark
castle
by
evil
giants.
He
was
very
brave
and
smart
and
he
tricked
the
giants
and
escapedвЂ¦
but
no
sooner
was
he
outside
the
castle
than
the
Others
took
him,
and
drank
his
hot
red
blood.
Now
she
knew
how
he
must
have
felt.

The
one-armed
woman
died
at
evenfall.
Gendry
and
Cutjack
dug
her
grave
on
a
hillside
beneath
a
weeping
willow.
When
the
wind
blew,
Arya
thought
she
could
hear
the
long
trailing
branches
whispering,
вЂњPlease.
Please.
Please.вЂќ
The
little
hairs
on
the
back
of
her
neck
rose,
and
she
almost
ran
from
the
graveside.

вЂњNo
fire
tonight,вЂќ
Yoren
told
them.
Supper
was
a
handful
of
wild
radishes
Koss
found,
a
cup
of
dry
beans,
water
from
a
nearby
brook.
The
water
had
a
funny
taste
to
it,
and
Lommy
told
them
it
was
the
taste
of
bodies,
rotting
someplace
upstream.
Hot
Pie
would
have
hit
him
if
old
Reysen
hadnвЂ™t
pulled
them
apart.

Arya
drank
too
much
water,
just
to
fill
her
belly
with
something.
She
never
thought
sheвЂ™d
be
able
to
sleep,
yet
somehow
she
did.
When
she
woke,
it
was
pitch-black
and
her
bladder
was
full
to
bursting.
Sleepers
huddled
all
around
her,
wrapped
in
blankets
and
cloaks.
Arya
found
Needle,
stood,
listened.
She
heard
the
soft
footfalls
of
a
sentry,
men
turning
in
restless
sleep,
RorgeвЂ™s
rattling
snores,
and
the
queer
hissing
sound
that
Biter
made
when
he
slept.
From
a
different
wagon
came
the
steady
rhythmic
scrape
of
steel
on
stone
as
Yoren
sat,
chewing
sourleaf
and
sharpening
the
edge
of
his
dirk.

Hot
Pie
was
one
of
the
boys
on
watch.
вЂњWhere
you
going?вЂќ
he
asked
when
he
saw
Arya
heading
for
the
trees.

Arya
waved
vaguely
at
the
woods.

вЂњNo
youвЂ™re
not,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said.
He
had
gotten
bolder
again
now
that
he
had
a
sword
on
his
belt,
even
though
it
was
just
a
shortsword
and
he
handled
it
like
a
cleaver.
вЂњThe
old
man
said
for
everyone
to
stay
close
tonight.вЂќ

вЂњI
need
to
make
water,вЂќ
Arya
explained.

вЂњWell,
use
that
tree
right
there.вЂќ
He
pointed.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
know
whatвЂ™s
out
there,
Arry.
I
heard
wolves
before.вЂќ

Yoren
wouldnвЂ™t
like
it
if
she
fought
with
him.
She
tried
to
look
afraid.
вЂњWolves?
For
true?вЂќ

вЂњI
heard,вЂќ
he
assured
her.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
think
I
need
to
go
after
all.вЂќ
She
went
back
to
her
blanket
and
pretended
to
sleep
until
she
heard
Hot
PieвЂ™s
footsteps
going
away.
Then
she
rolled
over
and
slipped
off
into
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
There
were
sentries
out
this
way
too,
but
Arya
had
no
trouble
avoiding
them.
Just
to
make
sure,
she
went
out
twice
as
far
as
usual.
When
she
was
sure
there
was
no
one
near,
she
skinned
down
her
breeches
and
squatted
to
do
her
business.

She
was
making
water,
her
clothing
tangled
about
her
ankles,
when
she
heard
rustling
from
under
the
trees.
Hot
Pie,
she
thought
in
panic,
he
followed
me.
Then
she
saw
the
eyes
shining
out
from
the
wood,
bright
with
reflected
moonlight.
Her
belly
clenched
tight
as
she
grabbed
for
Needle,
not
caring
if
she
pissed
herself,
counting
eyes,
two
four
eight
twelve,
a
whole
packвЂ¦

One
of
them
came
padding
out
from
under
the
trees.
He
stared
at
her,
and
bared
his
teeth,
and
all
she
could
think
was
how
stupid
sheвЂ™d
been
and
how
Hot
Pie
would
gloat
when
they
found
her
half-eaten
body
the
next
morning.
But
the
wolf
turned
and
raced
back
into
the
darkness,
and
quick
as
that
the
eyes
were
gone.
Trembling,
she
cleaned
herself
and
laced
up
and
followed
a
distant
scraping
sound
back
to
camp,
and
to
Yoren.
Arya
climbed
up
into
the
wagon
beside
him,
shaken.
вЂњWolves,вЂќ
she
whispered
hoarsely.
вЂњIn
the
woods.вЂќ

вЂњAye.
They
would
be.вЂќ
He
never
looked
at
her.

вЂњThey
scared
me.вЂќ

вЂњDid
they?вЂќ
He
spat.
вЂњSeems
to
me
your
kind
was
fond
oвЂ™
wolves.вЂќ

вЂњNymeria
was
a
direwolf.вЂќ
Arya
hugged
herself.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
different.
Anyhow,
sheвЂ™s
gone.
Jory
and
I
threw
rocks
at
her
until
she
ran
off,
or
else
the
queen
would
have
killed
her.вЂќ
It
made
her
sad
to
talk
about
it.
вЂњI
bet
if
sheвЂ™d
been
in
the
city,
she
wouldnвЂ™t
have
let
them
cut
off
FatherвЂ™s
head.вЂќ

вЂњOrphan
boys
got
no
fathers,вЂќ
Yoren
said,
вЂњor
did
you
forget
that?вЂќ
The
sourleaf
had
turned
his
spit
red,
so
it
looked
like
his
mouth
was
bleeding.
вЂњThe
only
wolves
we
got
to
fear
are
the
ones
wear
manskin,
like
those
who
done
for
that
village.вЂќ

вЂњI
wish
I
was
home,вЂќ
she
said
miserably.
She
tried
so
hard
to
be
brave,
to
be
fierce
as
a
wolverine
and
all,
but
sometimes
she
felt
like
she
was
just
a
little
girl
after
all.

The
black
brother
peeled
a
fresh
sourleaf
from
the
bale
in
the
wagon
and
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth.
вЂњMight
be
I
should
of
left
you
where
I
found
you,
boy.
All
of
you.
Safer
in
the
city,
seems
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
care.
I
want
to
go
home.вЂќ

вЂњBeen
bringing
men
to
the
Wall
for
close
on
thirty
years.вЂќ
Froth
shone
on
YorenвЂ™s
lips,
like
bubbles
of
blood.
вЂњAll
that
time,
I
only
lost
three.
Old
man
died
of
a
fever,
city
boy
got
snakebit
taking
a
shit,
and
one
fool
tried
to
kill
me
in
my
sleep
and
got
a
red
smile
for
his
trouble.вЂќ
He
drew
the
dirk
across
his
throat,
to
show
her.
вЂњThree
in
thirty
years.вЂќ
He
spat
out
the
old
sourleaf.
вЂњA
ship
now,
might
have
been
wiser.
No
chance
oвЂ™
finding
more
men
on
the
way,
but
stillвЂ¦
clever
man,
heвЂ™d
go
by
ship,
but
meвЂ¦
thirty
years
I
been
taking
this
kingsroad.вЂќ
He
sheathed
his
dirk.
вЂњGo
to
sleep,
boy.
Hear
me?вЂќ

She
did
try.
Yet
as
she
lay
under
her
thin
blanket,
she
could
hear
the
wolves
howlingвЂ¦
and
another
sound,
fainter,
no
more
than
a
whisper
on
the
wind,
that
might
have
been
screams.





DAVOS

The
morning
air
was
dark
with
the
smoke
of
burning
gods.

They
were
all
afire
now,
Maid
and
Mother,
Warrior
and
Smith,
the
Crone
with
her
pearl
eyes
and
the
Father
with
his
gilded
beard;
even
the
Stranger,
carved
to
look
more
animal
than
human.
The
old
dry
wood
and
countless
layers
of
paint
and
varnish
blazed
with
a
fierce
hungry
light.
Heat
rose
shimmering
through
the
chill
air;
behind,
the
gargoyles
and
stone
dragons
on
the
castle
walls
seemed
blurred,
as
if
Davos
were
seeing
them
through
a
veil
of
tears.
Or
as
if
the
beasts
were
trembling,
stirringвЂ¦

вЂњAn
ill
thing,вЂќ
Allard
declared,
though
at
least
he
had
the
sense
to
keep
his
voice
low.
Dale
muttered
agreement.

вЂњSilence,вЂќ
said
Davos.
вЂњRemember
where
you
are.вЂќ
His
sons
were
good
men,
but
young,
and
Allard
especially
was
rash.
Had
I
stayed
a
smuggler,
Allard
would
have
ended
on
the
Wall.
Stannis
spared
him
from
that
end,
something
else
I
owe
himвЂ¦

Hundreds
had
come
to
the
castle
gates
to
bear
witness
to
the
burning
of
the
Seven.
The
smell
in
the
air
was
ugly.
Even
for
soldiers,
it
was
hard
not
to
feel
uneasy
at
such
an
affront
to
the
gods
most
had
worshiped
all
their
lives.

The
red
woman
walked
round
the
fire
three
times,
praying
once
in
the
speech
of
Asshai,
once
in
High
Valyrian,
and
once
in
the
Common
Tongue.
Davos
understood
only
the
last.
вЂњRвЂ™hllor,
come
to
us
in
our
darkness,вЂќ
she
called.
вЂњLord
of
Light,
we
offer
you
these
false
gods,
these
seven
who
are
one,
and
him
the
enemy.
Take
them
and
cast
your
light
upon
us,
for
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.вЂќ
Queen
Selyse
echoed
the
words.
Beside
her,
Stannis
watched
impassively,
his
jaw
hard
as
stone
under
the
blue-black
shadow
of
his
tight-cropped
beard.
He
had
dressed
more
richly
than
was
his
wont,
as
if
for
the
sept.

DragonstoneвЂ™s
sept
had
been
where
Aegon
the
Conqueror
knelt
to
pray
the
night
before
he
sailed.
That
had
not
saved
it
from
the
queenвЂ™s
men.
They
had
overturned
the
altars,
pulled
down
the
statues,
and
smashed
the
stained
glass
with
warhammers.
Septon
Barre
could
only
curse
them,
but
Ser
Hubard
Rambton
led
his
three
sons
to
the
sept
to
defend
their
gods.
The
Rambtons
had
slain
four
of
the
queenвЂ™s
men
before
the
others
overwhelmed
them.
Afterward
Guncer
Sunglass,
mildest
and
most
pious
of
lords,
told
Stannis
he
could
no
longer
support
his
claim.
Now
he
shared
a
sweltering
cell
with
the
septon
and
Ser
HubardвЂ™s
two
surviving
sons.
The
other
lords
had
not
been
slow
to
take
the
lesson.

The
gods
had
never
meant
much
to
Davos
the
smuggler,
though
like
most
men
he
had
been
known
to
make
offerings
to
the
Warrior
before
battle,
to
the
Smith
when
he
launched
a
ship,
and
to
the
Mother
whenever
his
wife
grew
great
with
child.
He
felt
ill
as
he
watched
them
burn,
and
not
only
from
the
smoke.

Maester
Cressen
would
have
stopped
this.
The
old
man
had
challenged
the
Lord
of
Light
and
been
struck
down
for
his
impiety,
or
so
the
gossips
told
each
other.
Davos
knew
the
truth.
He
had
seen
the
maester
slip
something
into
the
wine
cup.
Poison.
What
else
could
it
be?
He
drank
a
cup
of
death
to
free
Stannis
from
Melisandre,
but
somehow
her
god
shielded
her.
He
would
gladly
have
killed
the
red
woman
for
that,
yet
what
chance
would
he
have
where
a
maester
of
the
Citadel
had
failed?
He
was
only
a
smuggler
raised
high,
Davos
of
Flea
Bottom,
the
Onion
Knight.

The
burning
gods
cast
a
pretty
light,
wreathed
in
their
robes
of
shifting
flame,
red
and
orange
and
yellow.
Septon
Barre
had
once
told
Davos
how
theyвЂ™d
been
carved
from
the
masts
of
the
ships
that
had
carried
the
first
Targaryens
from
Valyria.
Over
the
centuries,
they
had
been
painted
and
repainted,
gilded,
silvered,
jeweled.
вЂњTheir
beauty
will
make
them
more
pleasing
to
RвЂ™hllor,вЂќ
Melisandre
said
when
she
told
Stannis
to
pull
them
down
and
drag
them
out
the
castle
gates.

The
Maiden
lay
athwart
the
Warrior,
her
arms
widespread
as
if
to
embrace
him.
The
Mother
seemed
almost
to
shudder
as
the
flames
came
licking
up
her
face.
A
longsword
had
been
thrust
through
her
heart,
and
its
leather
grip
was
alive
with
flame.
The
Father
was
on
the
bottom,
the
first
to
fall.
Davos
watched
the
hand
of
the
Stranger
writhe
and
curl
as
the
fingers
blackened
and
fell
away
one
by
one,
reduced
to
so
much
glowing
charcoal.
Nearby,
Lord
Celtigar
coughed
fitfully
and
covered
his
wrinkled
face
with
a
square
of
linen
embroidered
in
red
crabs.
The
Myrmen
swapped
jokes
as
they
enjoyed
the
warmth
of
the
fire,
but
young
Lord
Bar
Emmon
had
turned
a
splotchy
grey,
and
Lord
Velaryon
was
watching
the
king
rather
than
the
conflagration.

Davos
would
have
given
much
to
know
what
he
was
thinking,
but
one
such
as
Velaryon
would
never
confide
in
him.
The
Lord
of
the
Tides
was
of
the
blood
of
ancient
Valyria,
and
his
House
had
thrice
provided
brides
for
Targaryen
princes;
Davos
Seaworth
stank
of
fish
and
onions.
It
was
the
same
with
the
other
lordlings.
He
could
trust
none
of
them,
nor
would
they
ever
include
him
in
their
private
councils.
They
scorned
his
sons
as
well.
My
grandsons
will
joust
with
theirs,
though,
and
one
day
their
blood
may
wed
with
mine.
In
time
my
little
black
ship
will
fly
as
high
as
VelaryonвЂ™s
seahorse
or
CeltigarвЂ™s
red
crabs.

That
is,
if
Stannis
won
his
throne.
If
he
lostвЂ¦

Everything
I
am,
I
owe
to
him.
Stannis
had
raised
him
to
knighthood.
He
had
given
him
a
place
of
honor
at
his
table,
a
war
galley
to
sail
in
place
of
a
smugglerвЂ™s
skiff.
Dale
and
Allard
captained
galleys
as
well,
Maric
was
oarmaster
on
the
Fury,
Matthos
served
his
father
on
Black
Betha,
and
the
king
had
taken
Devan
as
a
royal
squire.
One
day
he
would
be
knighted,
and
the
two
little
lads
as
well.
Marya
was
mistress
of
a
small
keep
on
Cape
Wrath,
with
servants
who
called
her
mвЂ™lady,
and
Davos
could
hunt
red
deer
in
his
own
woods.
All
this
he
had
of
Stannis
Baratheon,
for
the
price
of
a
few
finger
joints.
It
was
just,
what
he
did
to
me.
I
had
flouted
the
kingвЂ™s
laws
all
my
life.
He
has
earned
my
loyalty.
Davos
touched
the
little
pouch
that
hung
from
the
leather
thong
about
his
neck.
His
fingers
were
his
luck,
and
he
needed
luck
now.
As
do
we
all.
Lord
Stannis
most
of
all.

Pale
flames
licked
at
the
grey
sky.
Dark
smoke
rose,
twisting
and
curling.
When
the
wind
pushed
it
toward
them,
men
blinked
and
wept
and
rubbed
their
eyes.
Allard
turned
his
head
away,
coughing
and
cursing.
A
taste
of
things
to
come,
thought
Davos.
Many
and
more
would
burn
before
this
war
was
done.

Melisandre
was
robed
all
in
scarlet
satin
and
blood
velvet,
her
eyes
as
red
as
the
great
ruby
that
glistened
at
her
throat
as
if
it
too
were
afire.
вЂњIn
ancient
books
of
Asshai
it
is
written
that
there
will
come
a
day
after
a
long
summer
when
the
stars
bleed
and
the
cold
breath
of
darkness
falls
heavy
on
the
world.
In
this
dread
hour
a
warrior
shall
draw
from
the
fire
a
burning
sword.
And
that
sword
shall
be
Lightbringer,
the
Red
Sword
of
Heroes,
and
he
who
clasps
it
shall
be
Azor
Ahai
come
again,
and
the
darkness
shall
flee
before
him.вЂќ
She
lifted
her
voice,
so
it
carried
out
over
the
gathered
host.
вЂњAzor
Ahai,
beloved
of
RвЂ™hllor!
The
Warrior
of
Light,
the
Son
of
Fire!
Come
forth,
your
sword
awaits
you!
Come
forth
and
take
it
into
your
hand!вЂќ

Stannis
Baratheon
strode
forward
like
a
soldier
marching
into
battle.
His
squires
stepped
up
to
attend
him.
Davos
watched
as
his
son
Devan
pulled
a
long
padded
glove
over
the
kingвЂ™s
right
hand.
The
boy
wore
a
cream-colored
doublet
with
a
fiery
heart
sewn
on
the
breast.
Bryen
Farring
was
similarly
garbed
as
he
tied
a
stiff
leather
cape
around
His
GraceвЂ™s
neck.
Behind,
Davos
heard
a
faint
clank
and
clatter
of
bells.
вЂњUnder
the
sea,
smoke
rises
in
bubbles,
and
flames
burn
green
and
blue
and
black,вЂќ
Patchface
sang
somewhere.
вЂњI
know,
I
know,
oh,
oh,
oh.вЂќ

The
king
plunged
into
the
fire
with
his
teeth
clenched,
holding
the
leather
cloak
before
him
to
keep
off
the
flames.
He
went
straight
to
the
Mother,
grasped
the
sword
with
his
gloved
hand,
and
wrenched
it
free
of
the
burning
wood
with
a
single
hard
jerk.
Then
he
was
retreating,
the
sword
held
high,
jade-green
flames
swirling
around
cherry-red
steel.
Guards
rushed
to
beat
out
the
cinders
that
clung
to
the
kingвЂ™s
clothing.

вЂњA
sword
of
fire!вЂќ
shouted
Queen
Selyse.
Ser
Axell
Florent
and
the
other
queenвЂ™s
men
took
up
the
cry.
вЂњA
sword
of
fire!
It
burns!
It
burns!
A
sword
of
fire!вЂќ

Melisandre
lifted
her
hands
above
her
head.
вЂњBehold!
A
sign
was
promised,
and
now
a
sign
is
seen!
Behold
Lightbringer!
Azor
Ahai
has
come
again!
All
hail
the
Warrior
of
Light!
All
hail
the
Son
of
Fire!вЂќ

A
ragged
wave
of
shouts
gave
answer,
just
as
StannisвЂ™s
glove
began
to
smolder.
Cursing,
the
king
thrust
the
point
of
the
sword
into
the
damp
earth
and
beat
out
the
flames
against
his
leg.

вЂњLord,
cast
your
light
upon
us!вЂќ
Melisandre
called
out.

вЂњFor
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors,вЂќ
Selyse
and
her
queenвЂ™s
men
replied.
Should
I
speak
the
words
as
well?
Davos
wondered.
Do
I
owe
Stannis
that
much?
Is
this
fiery
god
truly
his
own?
His
shortened
fingers
twitched.

Stannis
peeled
off
the
glove
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
gods
in
the
pyre
were
scarcely
recognizable
anymore.
The
head
fell
off
the
Smith
with
a
puff
of
ash
and
embers.
Melisandre
sang
in
the
tongue
of
Asshai,
her
voice
rising
and
falling
like
the
tides
of
the
sea.
Stannis
untied
his
singed
leather
cape
and
listened
in
silence.
Thrust
in
the
ground,
Lightbringer
still
glowed
ruddy
hot,
but
the
flames
that
clung
to
the
sword
were
dwindling
and
dying.

By
the
time
the
song
was
done,
only
charwood
remained
of
the
gods,
and
the
kingвЂ™s
patience
had
run
its
course.
He
took
the
queen
by
the
elbow
and
escorted
her
back
into
Dragonstone,
leaving
Lightbringer
where
it
stood.
The
red
woman
remained
a
moment
to
watch
as
Devan
knelt
with
Byren
Farring
and
rolled
up
the
burnt
and
blackened
sword
in
the
kingвЂ™s
leather
cloak.
The
Red
Sword
of
Heroes
looks
a
proper
mess,
thought
Davos.

A
few
of
the
lords
lingered
to
speak
in
quiet
voices
upwind
of
the
fire.
They
fell
silent
when
they
saw
Davos
looking
at
them.
Should
Stannis
fall,
they
will
pull
me
down
in
an
instant.
Neither
was
he
counted
one
of
the
queenвЂ™s
men,
that
group
of
ambitious
knights
and
minor
lordlings
who
had
given
themselves
to
this
Lord
of
Light
and
so
won
the
favor
and
patronage
of
LadyвЂ”no,
Queen,
remember?вЂ”Selyse.

The
fire
had
started
to
dwindle
by
the
time
Melisandre
and
the
squires
departed
with
the
precious
sword.
Davos
and
his
sons
joined
the
crowd
making
its
way
down
to
the
shore
and
the
waiting
ships.
вЂњDevan
acquitted
himself
well,вЂќ
he
said
as
they
went.

вЂњHe
fetched
the
glove
without
dropping
it,
yes,вЂќ
said
Dale.

Allard
nodded.
вЂњThat
badge
on
DevanвЂ™s
doublet,
the
fiery
heart,
what
was
that?
The
Baratheon
sigil
is
a
crowned
stag.вЂќ

вЂњA
lord
can
choose
more
than
one
badge,вЂќ
Davos
said.

Dale
smiled.
вЂњA
black
ship
and
an
onion,
Father?вЂќ

Allard
kicked
at
a
stone.
вЂњThe
Others
take
our
onionвЂ¦
and
that
flaming
heart.
It
was
an
ill
thing
to
burn
the
Seven.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
did
you
grow
so
devout?вЂќ
Davos
said.
вЂњWhat
does
a
smugglerвЂ™s
son
know
of
the
doings
of
gods?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
a
knightвЂ™s
son,
Father.
If
you
wonвЂ™t
remember,
why
should
they?
вЂњ

вЂњA
knightвЂ™s
son,
but
not
a
knight,вЂќ
said
Davos.
вЂњNor
will
you
ever
be,
if
you
meddle
in
affairs
that
do
not
concern
you.
Stannis
is
our
rightful
king,
it
is
not
for
us
to
question
him.
We
sail
his
ships
and
do
his
bidding.
That
is
all.вЂќ

вЂњAs
to
that,
Father,вЂќ
Dale
said,
вЂњI
mislike
these
water
casks
theyвЂ™ve
given
me
for
Wraith.
Green
pine.
The
water
will
spoil
on
a
voyage
of
any
length.вЂќ

вЂњI
got
the
same
for
Lady
Marya,вЂќ
said
Allard.
вЂњThe
queenвЂ™s
men
have
laid
claim
to
all
the
seasoned
wood.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
speak
to
the
king
about
it,вЂќ
Davos
promised.
Better
it
come
from
him
than
from
Allard.
His
sons
were
good
fighters
and
better
sailors,
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
talk
to
lords.
They
were
lowborn,
even
as
I
was,
but
they
do
not
like
to
recall
that.
When
they
look
at
our
banner,
all
they
see
is
a
tall
black
ship
flying
on
the
wind.
They
close
their
eyes
to
the
onion.

The
port
was
as
crowded
as
Davos
had
ever
known
it.
Every
dock
teemed
with
sailors
loading
provisions,
and
every
inn
was
packed
with
soldiers
dicing
or
drinking
or
looking
for
a
whoreвЂ¦
a
vain
search,
since
Stannis
permitted
none
on
his
island.
Ships
lined
the
strand;
war
galleys
and
fishing
vessels,
stout
carracks
and
fat-bottomed
cogs.
The
best
berths
had
been
taken
by
the
largest
vessels:
StannisвЂ™s
flagship
Fury
rocking
between
Lord
Steffon
and
Stag
of
the
Sea,
Lord
VelaryonвЂ™s
silver-hulled
Pride
of
Driftmark
and
her
three
sisters,
Lord
CeltigarвЂ™s
ornate
Red
Claw,
the
ponderous
Swordfish
with
her
long
iron
prow.
Out
to
sea
at
anchor
rode
Salladhor
SaanвЂ™s
great
Valyrian
amongst
the
striped
hulls
of
two
dozen
smaller
Lysene
galleys.

A
weathered
little
inn
sat
on
the
end
of
the
stone
pier
where
Black
Betha,
Wraith,
and
Lady
Marya
shared
mooring
space
with
a
half-dozen
other
galleys
of
one
hundred
oars
or
less.
Davos
had
a
thirst.
He
took
his
leave
of
his
sons
and
turned
his
steps
toward
the
inn.
Out
front
squatted
a
waist-high
gargoyle,
so
eroded
by
rain
and
salt
that
his
features
were
all
but
obliterated.
He
and
Davos
were
old
friends,
though.
He
gave
a
pat
to
the
stone
head
as
he
went
in.
вЂњLuck,вЂќ
he
murmured.

Across
the
noisy
common
room,
Salladhor
Saan
sat
eating
grapes
from
a
wooden
bowl.
When
he
spied
Davos,
he
beckoned
him
closer.
вЂњSer
knight,
come
sit
with
me.
Eat
a
grape.
Eat
two.
They
are
marvelously
sweet.вЂќ
The
Lyseni
was
a
sleek,
smiling
man
whose
flamboyance
was
a
byword
on
both
sides
of
the
narrow
sea.
Today
he
wore
flashing
cloth-of-silver,
with
dagged
sleeves
so
long
the
ends
of
them
pooled
on
the
floor.
His
buttons
were
carved
jade
monkeys,
and
atop
his
wispy
white
curls
perched
a
jaunty
green
cap
decorated
with
a
fan
of
peacock
feathers.

Davos
threaded
his
way
through
the
tables
to
a
chair.
In
the
days
before
his
knighthood,
he
had
often
bought
cargoes
from
Salladhor
Saan.
The
Lyseni
was
a
smuggler
himself,
as
well
as
a
trader,
a
banker,
a
notorious
pirate,
and
the
self-styled
Prince
of
the
Narrow
Sea.
When
a
pirate
grows
rich
enough,
they
make
him
a
prince.
It
had
been
Davos
who
had
made
the
journey
to
Lys
to
recruit
the
old
rogue
to
Lord
StannisвЂ™s
cause.

вЂњYou
did
not
see
the
gods
burn,
my
lord?вЂќ
he
asked.

вЂњThe
red
priests
have
a
great
temple
on
Lys.
Always
they
are
burning
this
and
burning
that,
crying
out
to
their
RвЂ™hllor.
They
bore
me
with
their
fires.
Soon
they
will
bore
King
Stannis
too,
it
is
to
be
hoped.вЂќ
He
seemed
utterly
unconcerned
that
someone
might
overhear
him,
eating
his
grapes
and
dribbling
the
seeds
out
onto
his
lip,
flicking
them
off
with
a
finger.
вЂњMy
Bird
of
a
Thousand
Colors
came
in
yesterday,
good
ser.
She
is
not
a
warship,
no,
but
a
trader,
and
she
paid
a
call
on
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Are
you
sure
you
will
not
have
a
grape?
Children
go
hungry
in
the
city,
it
is
said.вЂќ
He
dangled
the
grapes
before
Davos
and
smiled.

вЂњItвЂ™s
ale
I
need,
and
news.вЂќ

вЂњThe
men
of
Westeros
are
ever
rushing,вЂќ
complained
Salladhor
Saan.
вЂњWhat
good
is
this,
I
ask
you?
He
who
hurries
through
life
hurries
to
his
grave.вЂќ
He
belched.
вЂњThe
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
has
sent
his
dwarf
to
see
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Perhaps
he
hopes
that
his
ugly
face
will
frighten
off
attackers,
eh?
Or
that
we
will
laugh
ourselves
dead
when
the
Imp
capers
on
the
battlements,
who
can
say?
The
dwarf
has
chased
off
the
lout
who
ruled
the
gold
cloaks
and
put
in
his
place
a
knight
with
an
iron
hand.вЂќ
He
plucked
a
grape,
and
squeezed
it
between
thumb
and
forefinger
until
the
skin
burst.
juice
ran
down
between
his
fingers.

A
serving
girl
pushed
her
way
through,
swatting
at
the
hands
that
groped
her
as
she
passed.
Davos
ordered
a
tankard
of
ale,
turned
back
to
Saan,
and
said,
вЂњHow
well
is
the
city
defended?вЂќ

The
other
shrugged.
вЂњThe
walls
are
high
and
strong,
but
who
will
man
them?
They
are
building
scorpions
and
spitfires,
oh,
yes,
but
the
men
in
the
golden
cloaks
are
too
few
and
too
green,
and
there
are
no
others.
A
swift
strike,
like
a
hawk
plummeting
at
a
hare,
and
the
great
city
will
be
ours.
Grant
us
wind
to
fill
our
sails,
and
your
king
could
sit
upon
his
Iron
Throne
by
evenfall
on
the
morrow.
We
could
dress
the
dwarf
in
motley
and
prick
his
little
cheeks
with
the
points
of
our
spears
to
make
him
dance
for
us,
and
mayhaps
your
goodly
king
would
make
me
a
gift
of
the
beautiful
Queen
Cersei
to
warm
my
bed
for
a
night.
I
have
been
too
long
away
from
my
wives,
and
all
in
his
service.вЂќ

вЂњPirate,вЂќ
said
Davos.
вЂњYou
have
no
wives,
only
concubines,
and
you
have
been
well
paid
for
every
day
and
every
ship.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
in
promises,вЂќ
said
Salladhor
Saan
mournfully.
вЂњGood
ser,
it
is
gold
I
crave,
not
words
on
papers.вЂќ
He
popped
a
grape
into
his
mouth.

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
have
your
gold
when
we
take
the
treasury
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
No
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
more
honorable
than
Stannis
Baratheon.
He
will
keep
his
word.вЂќ
Even
as
Davos
spoke,
he
thought,
This
world
is
twisted
beyond
hope,
when
lowborn
smugglers
must
vouch
for
the
honor
of
kings.

вЂњSo
he
has
said
and
said.
And
so
I
say,
let
us
do
this
thing.
Even
these
grapes
could
be
no
more
ripe
than
that
city,
my
old
friend.вЂќ

The
serving
girl
returned
with
his
ale.
Davos
gave
her
a
copper.
вЂњMight
be
we
could
take
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
as
you
say,вЂќ
he
said
as
he
lifted
the
tankard,
вЂњbut
how
long
would
we
hold
it?
Tywin
Lannister
is
known
to
be
at
Harrenhal
with
a
great
host,
and
Lord
RenlyвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAh,
yes,
the
young
brother,вЂќ
said
Salladhor
Saan.
вЂњThat
part
is
not
so
good,
my
friend.
King
Renly
bestirs
himself.
No,
here
he
is
Lord
Renly,
my
pardons.
So
many
kings,
my
tongue
grows
weary
of
the
word.
The
brother
Renly
has
left
Highgarden
with
his
fair
young
queen,
his
flowered
lords
and
shining
knights,
and
a
mighty
host
of
foot.
He
marches
up
your
road
of
roses
toward
the
very
same
great
city
we
were
speaking
of.вЂќ

вЂњHe
takes
his
bride?вЂќ

The
other
shrugged.
вЂњHe
did
not
tell
me
why.
Perhaps
he
is
loath
to
part
with
the
warm
burrow
between
her
thighs,
even
for
a
night.
Or
perhaps
he
is
that
certain
of
his
victory.вЂќ

вЂњThe
king
must
be
told.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
attended
to
it,
good
ser.
Though
His
Grace
frowns
so
whenever
he
does
see
me
that
I
tremble
to
come
before
him.
Do
you
think
he
would
like
me
better
if
I
wore
a
hair
shirt
and
never
smiled?
Well,
I
will
not
do
it.
I
am
an
honest
man,
he
must
suffer
me
in
silk
and
samite.
Or
else
I
shall
take
my
ships
where
I
am
better
loved.
That
sword
was
not
Lightbringer,
my
friend.вЂќ

The
sudden
shift
in
subject
left
Davos
uneasy.
вЂњSword?вЂќ

вЂњA
sword
plucked
from
fire,
yes.
Men
tell
me
things,
it
is
my
pleasant
smile.
How
shall
a
burnt
sword
serve
Stannis?вЂќ

вЂњA
burning
sword,вЂќ
corrected
Davos.

вЂњBurnt,вЂќ
said
Salladhor
Saan,
вЂњand
be
glad
of
that,
my
friend.
Do
you
know
the
tale
of
the
forging
of
Lightbringer?
I
shall
tell
it
to
you.
It
was
a
time
when
darkness
lay
heavy
on
the
world.
To
oppose
it,
the
hero
must
have
a
heroвЂ™s
blade,
oh,
like
none
that
had
ever
been.
And
so
for
thirty
days
and
thirty
nights
Azor
Ahai
labored
sleepless
in
the
temple,
forging
a
blade
in
the
sacred
fires.
Heat
and
hammer
and
fold,
heat
and
hammer
and
fold,
oh,
yes,
until
the
sword
was
done.
Yet
when
he
plunged
it
into
water
to
temper
the
steel
it
burst
asunder.

вЂњBeing
a
hero,
it
was
not
for
him
to
shrug
and
go
in
search
of
excellent
grapes
such
as
these,
so
again
he
began.
The
second
time
it
took
him
fifty
days
and
fifty
nights,
and
this
sword
seemed
even
finer
than
the
first.
Azor
Ahai
captured
a
lion,
to
temper
the
blade
by
plunging
it
through
the
beastвЂ™s
red
heart,
but
once
more
the
steel
shattered
and
split.
Great
was
his
woe
and
great
was
his
sorrow
then,
for
he
knew
what
he
must
do.

вЂњA
hundred
days
and
a
hundred
nights
he
labored
on
the
third
blade,
and
as
it
glowed
white-hot
in
the
sacred
fires,
he
summoned
his
wife.
вЂNissa
NissaвЂ™
he
said
to
her,
for
that
was
her
name,
вЂbare
your
breast,
and
know
that
I
love
you
best
of
all
that
is
in
this
world.вЂ™
She
did
this
thing,
why
I
cannot
say,
and
Azor
Ahai
thrust
the
smoking
sword
through
her
living
heart.
It
is
said
that
her
cry
of
anguish
and
ecstasy
left
a
crack
across
the
face
of
the
moon,
but
her
blood
and
her
soul
and
her
strength
and
her
courage
all
went
into
the
steel.
Such
is
the
tale
of
the
forging
of
Lightbringer,
the
Red
Sword
of
Heroes.

вЂњNow
do
you
see
my
meaning?
Be
glad
that
it
is
just
a
burnt
sword
that
His
Grace
pulled
from
that
fire.
Too
much
light
can
hurt
the
eyes,
my
friend,
and
fire
burns.вЂќ
Salladhor
Saan
finished
the
last
grape
and
smacked
his
lips.
вЂњWhen
do
you
think
the
king
will
bid
us
sail,
good
ser?
вЂњ

вЂњSoon,
I
think,вЂќ
said
Davos,
вЂњif
his
god
wills
it.вЂќ

вЂњHis
god,
ser
friend?
Not
yours?
Where
is
the
god
of
Ser
Davos
Seaworth,
knight
of
the
onion
ship?вЂќ

Davos
sipped
his
ale
to
give
himself
a
moment.
The
inn
is
crowded,
and
you
are
not
Salladhor
Saan,
he
reminded
himself.
Be
careful
how
you
answer.
вЂњKing
Stannis
is
my
god.
He
made
me
and
blessed
me
with
his
trust.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
remember.вЂќ
Salladhor
Saan
got
to
his
feet.
вЂњMy
pardons.
These
grapes
have
given
me
a
hunger,
and
dinner
awaits
on
my
Valyrian.
Minced
lamb
with
pepper
and
roasted
gull
stuffed
with
mushrooms
and
fennel
and
onion.
Soon
we
shall
eat
together
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
yes?
In
the
Red
Keep
we
shall
feast,
while
the
dwarf
sings
us
a
jolly
tune.
When
you
speak
to
King
Stannis,
mention
if
you
would
that
he
will
owe
me
another
thirty
thousand
dragons
come
the
black
of
the
moon.
He
ought
to
have
given
those
gods
to
me.
They
were
too
beautiful
to
burn,
and
might
have
brought
a
noble
price
in
Pentos
or
Myr.
Well,
if
he
grants
me
Queen
Cersei
for
a
night
I
shall
forgive
him.вЂќ
The
Lyseni
clapped
Davos
on
the
back,
and
swaggered
from
the
inn
as
if
he
owned
it.

Ser
Davos
Seaworth
lingered
over
his
tankard
for
a
good
while,
thinking.
A
year
ago,
he
had
been
with
Stannis
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
when
King
Robert
staged
a
tourney
for
Prince
JoffreyвЂ™s
name
day.
He
remembered
the
red
priest
Thoros
of
Myr,
and
the
flaming
sword
he
had
wielded
in
the
melee.
The
man
had
made
for
a
colorful
spectacle,
his
red
robes
flapping
while
his
blade
writhed
with
pale
green
flames,
but
everyone
knew
there
was
no
true
magic
to
it,
and
in
the
end
his
fire
had
guttered
out
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce
had
brained
him
with
a
common
mace.

A
true
sword
of
fire,
now,
that
would
be
a
wonder
to
behold.
Yet
at
such
a
costвЂ¦
When
he
thought
of
Nissa
Nissa,
it
was
his
own
Marya
he
pictured,
a
good-natured
plump
woman
with
sagging
breasts
and
a
kindly
smile,
the
best
woman
in
the
world.
He
tried
to
picture
himself
driving
a
sword
through
her,
and
shuddered.
I
am
not
made
of
the
stuff
of
heroes,
he
decided.
If
that
was
the
price
of
a
magic
sword,
it
was
more
than
he
cared
to
pay.

Davos
finished
his
ale,
pushed
away
the
tankard,
and
left
the
inn.
On
the
way
out
he
patted
the
gargoyle
on
the
head
and
muttered,
вЂњLuck.вЂќ
They
would
all
need
it.

It
was
well
after
dark
when
Devan
came
down
to
Black
Betha,
leading
a
snow-white
palfrey.
вЂњMy
lord
father,вЂќ
he
announced,
вЂњHis
Grace
commands
you
to
attend
him
in
the
Chamber
of
the
Painted
Table.
You
are
to
ride
the
horse
and
come
at
once.вЂќ

It
was
good
to
see
Devan
looking
so
splendid
in
his
squireвЂ™s
raiment,
but
the
summons
made
Davos
uneasy.
Will
he
bid
us
sail?
he
wondered.
Salladhor
Saan
was
not
the
only
captain
who
felt
that
KingвЂ™s
Landing
was
ripe
for
an
attack,
but
a
smuggler
must
learn
patience.
We
have
no
hope
of
victory.
I
said
as
much
to
Maester
Cressen,
the
day
I
returned
to
Dragonstone,
and
nothing
has
changed.
We
are
too
few,
the
foes
too
many.
ff
we
dip
our
oars,
we
die.
Nonetheless,
he
climbed
onto
the
horse.

When
Davos
arrived
at
the
Stone
Drum,
a
dozen
highborn
knights
and
great
bannermen
were
just
leaving.
Lords
Celtigar
and
Velaryon
each
gave
him
a
curt
nod
and
walked
on
while
the
others
ignored
him
utterly,
but
Ser
Axell
Florent
stopped
for
a
word.

Queen
SelyseвЂ™s
uncle
was
a
keg
of
a
man
with
thick
arms
and
bandy
legs.
He
had
the
prominent
ears
of
a
Florent,
even
larger
than
his
nieceвЂ™s.
The
coarse
hair
that
sprouted
from
his
did
not
stop
him
hearing
most
of
what
went
on
in
the
castle.
For
ten
years
Ser
Axell
had
served
as
castellan
of
Dragonstone
while
Stannis
sat
on
RobertвЂ™s
council
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
but
of
late
he
had
emerged
as
the
foremost
of
the
queenвЂ™s
men.
вЂњSer
Davos,
it
is
good
to
see
you,
as
ever,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњAnd
you,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњI
made
note
of
you
this
morning
as
well.
The
false
gods
burned
with
a
merry
light,
did
they
not?вЂќ

вЂњThey
burned
brightly.вЂќ
Davos
did
not
trust
this
man,
for
all
his
courtesy.
House
Florent
had
declared
for
Renly.

вЂњThe
Lady
Melisandre
tells
us
that
sometimes
RвЂ™hllor
permits
his
faithful
servants
to
glimpse
the
future
in
flames.
It
seemed
to
me
as
I
watched
the
fire
this
morning
that
I
was
looking
at
a
dozen
beautiful
dancers,
maidens
garbed
in
yellow
silk
spinning
and
swirling
before
a
great
king.
I
think
it
was
a
true
vision,
ser.
A
glimpse
of
the
glory
that
awaits
His
Grace
after
we
take
KingвЂ™s
Landing
and
the
throne
that
is
his
by
rights.вЂќ

Stannis
has
no
taste
for
such
dancing,
Davos
thought,
but
he
dared
not
offend
the
queenвЂ™s
uncle.
вЂњI
saw
only
fire,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbut
the
smoke
was
making
my
eyes
water.
You
must
pardon
me,
ser,
the
king
awaits.вЂќ
He
pushed
past,
wondering
why
Ser
Axell
had
troubled
himself.
He
is
a
queenвЂ™s
man
and
I
am
the
kingвЂ™s.

Stannis
sat
at
his
Painted
Table
with
Maester
Pylos
at
his
shoulder,
an
untidy
pile
of
papers
before
them.
вЂњSer,вЂќ
the
king
said
when
Davos
entered,
вЂњcome
have
a
look
at
this
letter.вЂќ

Obediently,
he
selected
a
paper
at
random.
вЂњIt
looks
handsome
enough,
Your
Grace,
but
I
fear
I
cannot
read
the
words.вЂќ
Davos
could
decipher
maps
and
charts
as
well
as
any,
but
letters
and
other
writings
were
beyond
his
powers.
But
my
Devan
has
learned
his
letters,
and
young
Steffon
and
Stannis
as
well.

вЂњIвЂ™d
forgotten.вЂќ
A
furrow
of
irritation
showed
between
the
kingвЂ™s
brows.
вЂњPylos,
read
it
to
him.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
The
maester
took
up
one
of
the
parchments
and
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњAll
men
know
me
for
the
trueborn
son
of
Steffon
Baratheon,
Lord
of
StormвЂ™s
End,
by
his
lady
wife
Cassana
of
House
Estermont.
I
declare
upon
the
honor
of
my
House
that
my
beloved
brother
Robert,
our
late
king,
left
no
trueborn
issue
of
his
body,
the
boy
Joffrey,
the
boy
Tommen,
and
the
girl
Myrcella
being
abominations
born
of
incest
between
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
brother
Jaime
the
Kingslayer.
By
right
of
birth
and
blood,
I
do
this
day
lay
claim
to
the
Iron
Throne
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros.
Let
all
true
men
declare
their
loyalty.
Done
in
the
Light
of
the
Lord,
under
the
sign
and
seal
of
Stannis
of
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
His
Name,
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.вЂќ
The
parchment
rustled
softly
as
Pylos
laid
it
down.

вЂњMake
it
Ser
Jaime
the
Kingslayer
henceforth,вЂќ
Stannis
said,
frowning.
вЂњWhatever
else
the
man
may
be,
he
remains
a
knight.
I
donвЂ™t
know
that
we
ought
to
call
Robert
my
beloved
brother
either.
He
loved
me
no
more
than
he
had
to,
nor
I
him.вЂќ

вЂњA
harmless
courtesy,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Pylos
said.

вЂњA
lie.
Take
it
out.вЂќ
Stannis
turned
to
Davos.
вЂњThe
maester
tells
me
that
we
have
one
hundred
seventeen
ravens
on
hand.
I
mean
to
use
them
all.
One
hundred
seventeen
ravens
will
carry
one
hundred
seventeen
copies
of
my
letter
to
every
corner
of
the
realm,
from
the
Arbor
to
the
Wall.
Perhaps
a
hundred
will
win
through
against
storm
and
hawk
and
arrow.
If
so,
a
hundred
maesters
will
read
my
words
to
as
many
lords
in
as
many
solars
and
bedchambersвЂ¦
and
then
the
letters
will
like
as
not
be
consigned
to
the
fire,
and
lips
pledged
to
silence.
These
great
lords
love
Joffrey,
or
Renly,
or
Robb
Stark.
I
am
their
rightful
king,
but
they
will
deny
me
if
they
can.
So
I
have
need
of
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
yours
to
command,
my
king.
As
ever.вЂќ

Stannis
nodded.
вЂњI
mean
for
you
to
sail
Black
Betha
north,
to
Gulltown,
the
Fingers,
the
Three
Sisters,
even
White
Harbor.
Your
son
Dale
will
go
south
in
Wraith,
past
Cape
Wrath
and
the
Broken
Arm,
all
along
the
coast
of
Dorne
as
far
as
the
Arbor.
Each
of
you
will
carry
a
chest
of
letters,
and
you
will
deliver
one
to
every
port
and
holdfast
and
fishing
village.
Nail
them
to
the
doors
of
septs
and
inns
for
every
man
to
read
who
can.вЂќ

Davos
said,
вЂњThat
will
be
few
enough.вЂќ

вЂњSer
Davos
speaks
truly,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
said
Maester
Pylos.
вЂњIt
would
be
better
to
have
the
letters
read
aloud.вЂќ

вЂњBetter,
but
more
dangerous,вЂќ
said
Stannis.
вЂњThese
words
will
not
be
kindly
received.вЂќ

вЂњGive
me
knights
to
do
the
reading,вЂќ
Davos
said.
вЂњThat
will
carry
more
weight
than
anything
I
might
say.вЂќ

Stannis
seemed
well
satisfied
with
that.
вЂњI
can
give
you
such
men,
yes.
I
have
a
hundred
knights
who
would
sooner
read
than
fight.
Be
open
where
you
can
and
stealthy
where
you
must.
Use
every
smugglerвЂ™s
trick
you
know,
the
black
sails,
the
hidden
coves,
whatever
it
requires.
If
you
run
short
of
letters,
capture
a
few
septons
and
set
them
to
copying
out
more.
I
mean
to
use
your
second
son
as
well.
He
will
take
Lady
Marya
across
the
narrow
sea,
to
Braavos
and
the
other
Free
Cities,
to
deliver
other
letters
to
the
men
who
rule
there.
The
world
will
know
of
my
claim,
and
of
CerseiвЂ™s
infamy.вЂќ

You
can
tell
them,
Davos
thought,
but
will
they
believe?
He
glanced
thoughtfully
at
Maester
Pylos.
The
king
caught
the
look.
вЂњMaester,
perhaps
you
ought
get
to
your
writing.
We
will
need
a
great
many
letters,
and
soon.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.вЂќ
Pylos
bowed,
and
took
his
leave.

The
king
waited
until
he
was
gone
before
he
said,
вЂњWhat
is
it
you
would
not
say
in
the
presence
of
my
maester,
Davos?вЂќ

вЂњMy
liege,
Pylos
is
pleasant
enough,
but
I
cannot
see
the
chain
about
his
neck
without
mourning
for
Maester
Cressen.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
his
fault
the
old
man
died?вЂќ
Stannis
glanced
into
the
fire.
вЂњI
never
wanted
Cressen
at
that
feast.
HeвЂ™d
angered
me,
yes,
heвЂ™d
given
me
bad
counsel,
but
I
did
not
want
him
dead.
IвЂ™d
hoped
he
might
be
granted
a
few
years
of
ease
and
comfort.
He
had
earned
that
much,
at
least,
butвЂќвЂ”he
ground
his
teeth
togetherвЂ”вЂњbut
he
died.
And
Pylos
serves
me
ably.вЂќ

вЂњPylos
is
the
least
of
it.
The
letterвЂ¦
What
did
your
lords
make
of
it,
I
wonder?вЂќ

Stannis
snorted.
вЂњCeltigar
pronounced
it
admirable.
If
I
showed
him
the
contents
of
my
privy,
he
would
declare
that
admirable
as
well.
The
others
bobbed
their
heads
up
and
down
like
a
flock
of
geese,
all
but
Velaryon,
who
said
that
steel
would
decide
the
matter,
not
words
on
parchment.
As
if
I
had
never
suspected.
The
Others
take
my
lords,
IвЂ™ll
hear
your
views.вЂќ

вЂњYour
words
were
blunt
and
strong.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
true.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
true.
Yet
you
have
no
proof.
Of
this
incest.
No
more
than
you
did
a
year
ago.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
proof
of
a
sort
at
StormвЂ™s
End.
RobertвЂ™s
bastard.
The
one
he
fathered
on
my
wedding
night,
in
the
very
bed
theyвЂ™d
made
up
for
me
and
my
bride.
Delena
was
a
Florent,
and
a
maiden
when
he
took
her,
so
Robert
acknowledged
the
babe.
Edric
Storm,
they
call
him.
He
is
said
to
be
the
very
image
of
my
brother.
If
men
were
to
see
him,
and
then
look
again
at
Joffrey
and
Tommen,
they
could
not
help
but
wonder,
I
would
think.вЂќ

вЂњYet
how
are
men
to
see
him,
if
he
is
at
StormвЂ™s
End?вЂќ

Stannis
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
Painted
Table.
вЂњIt
is
a
difficulty.
One
of
many.вЂќ
He
raised
his
eyes.
вЂњYou
have
more
to
say
about
the
letter.
Well,
get
on
with
it.
I
did
not
make
you
a
knight
so
you
could
learn
to
mouth
empty
courtesies.
I
have
my
lords
for
that.
Say
what
you
would
say,
Davos.вЂќ

Davos
bowed
his
head.
вЂњThere
was
a
phrase
at
the
end.
How
did
it
go?
Done
in
the
Light
of
the
LordвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
The
kingвЂ™s
jaw
was
clenched.

вЂњYour
people
will
mislike
those
words.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
did?вЂќ
said
Stannis
sharply.

вЂњIf
you
were
to
say
instead,
Done
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men,
or
By
the
grace
of
the
gods
old
and
newвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHave
you
gone
devout
on
me,
smuggler?вЂќ

вЂњThat
was
to
be
my
question
for
you,
my
liege.вЂќ

вЂњWas
it
now?
It
sounds
as
though
you
love
my
new
god
no
more
than
you
love
my
new
maester.вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
know
this
Lord
of
Light,вЂќ
Davos
admitted,
вЂњbut
I
knew
the
gods
we
burned
this
morning.
The
Smith
has
kept
my
ships
safe,
while
the
Mother
has
given
me
seven
strong
sons.вЂќ

вЂњYour
wife
has
given
you
seven
strong
sons.
Do
you
pray
to
her?
It
was
wood
we
burned
this
morning.вЂќ

вЂњThat
may
be
so,вЂќ
Davos
said,
вЂњbut
when
I
was
a
boy
in
Flea
Bottom
begging
for
a
copper,
sometimes
the
septons
would
feed
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
feed
you
now.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
given
me
an
honored
place
at
your
table.
And
in
return
I
give
you
truth.
Your
people
will
not
love
you
if
you
take
from
them
the
gods
they
have
always
worshiped,
and
give
them
one
whose
very
name
sounds
queer
on
their
tongues.вЂќ

Stannis
stood
abruptly.
вЂњRвЂ™hllor.
Why
is
that
so
hard?
They
will
not
love
me,
you
say?
When
have
they
ever
loved
me?
How
can
I
lose
something
I
have
never
owned?вЂќ
He
moved
to
the
south
window
to
gaze
out
at
the
moonlit
sea.
вЂњI
stopped
believing
in
gods
the
day
I
saw
the
Windproud
break
up
across
the
bay.
Any
gods
so
monstrous
as
to
drown
my
mother
and
father
would
never
have
my
worship,
I
vowed.
In
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
the
High
Septon
would
prattle
at
me
of
how
all
justice
and
goodness
flowed
from
the
Seven,
but
all
I
ever
saw
of
either
was
made
by
men.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
do
not
believe
in
godsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”why
trouble
with
this
new
one?вЂќ
Stannis
broke
in.
вЂњI
have
asked
myself
as
well.
I
know
little
and
care
less
of
gods,
but
the
red
priestess
has
power.вЂќ

Yes,
but
what
sort
of
power?
вЂњCressen
had
wisdom.вЂќ

вЂњI
trusted
in
his
wisdom
and
your
wiles,
and
what
did
they
avail
me,
smuggler?
The
storm
lords
sent
you
packing.
I
went
to
them
a
beggar
and
they
laughed
at
me.
Well,
there
will
be
no
more
begging,
and
no
more
laughing
either.
The
Iron
Throne
is
mine
by
rights,
but
how
am
I
to
take
it?
There
are
four
kings
in
the
realm,
and
three
of
them
have
more
men
and
more
gold
than
I
do.
I
have
shipsвЂ¦
and
I
have
her.
The
red
woman.
Half
my
knights
are
afraid
even
to
say
her
name,
did
you
know?
If
she
can
do
nothing
else,
a
sorceress
who
can
inspire
such
dread
in
grown
men
is
not
to
be
despised.
A
frightened
man
is
a
beaten
man.
And
perhaps
she
can
do
more.
I
mean
to
find
out.

вЂњWhen
I
was
a
lad
I
found
an
injured
goshawk
and
nursed
her
back
to
health.
Proudwing,
I
named
her.
She
would
perch
on
my
shoulder
and
flutter
from
room
to
room
after
me
and
take
food
from
my
hand,
but
she
would
not
soar.
Time
and
again
I
would
take
her
hawking,
but
she
never
flew
higher
than
the
treetops.
Robert
called
her
Weakwing.
He
owned
a
gyrfalcon
named
Thunderclap
who
never
missed
her
strike.
One
day
our
great-uncle
Ser
Harbert
told
me
to
try
a
different
bird.
I
was
making
a
fool
of
myself
with
Proudwing,
he
said,
and
he
was
right.вЂќ
Stannis
Baratheon
turned
away
from
the
window,
and
the
ghosts
who
moved
upon
the
southern
sea.
вЂњThe
Seven
have
never
brought
me
so
much
as
a
sparrow.
It
is
time
I
tried
another
hawk,
Davos.
A
red
hawk.вЂќ





THEON

There
was
no
safe
anchorage
at
Pyke,
but
Theon
Greyjoy
wished
to
look
on
his
fatherвЂ™s
castle
from
the
sea,
to
see
it
as
he
had
seen
it
last,
ten
years
before,
when
Robert
BaratheonвЂ™s
war
galley
had
borne
him
away
to
be
a
ward
of
Eddard
Stark.
On
that
day
he
had
stood
beside
the
rail,
listening
to
the
stroke
of
the
oars
and
the
pounding
of
the
masterвЂ™s
drum
while
he
watched
Pyke
dwindle
in
the
distance.
Now
he
wanted
to
see
it
grow
larger,
to
rise
from
the
sea
before
him.

Obedient
to
his
wishes,
the
Myraham
beat
her
way
past
the
point
with
her
sails
snapping
and
her
captain
cursing
the
wind
and
his
crew
and
the
follies
of
highborn
lordlings.
Theon
drew
the
hood
of
his
cloak
up
against
the
spray,
and
looked
for
home.

The
shore
was
all
sharp
rocks
and
glowering
cliffs,
and
the
castle
seemed
one
with
the
rest,
its
towers
and
walls
and
bridges
quarried
from
the
same
grey-black
stone,
wet
by
the
same
salt
waves,
festooned
with
the
same
spreading
patches
of
dark
green
lichen,
speckled
by
the
droppings
of
the
same
seabirds.
The
point
of
land
on
which
the
Greyjoys
had
raised
their
fortress
had
once
thrust
like
a
sword
into
the
bowels
of
the
ocean,
but
the
waves
had
hammered
at
it
day
and
night
until
the
land
broke
and
shattered,
thousands
of
years
past.
All
that
remained
were
three
bare
and
barren
islands
and
a
dozen
towering
stacks
of
rock
that
rose
from
the
water
like
the
pillars
of
some
sea
godвЂ™s
temple,
while
the
angry
waves
foamed
and
crashed
among
them.

Drear,
dark,
forbidding,
Pyke
stood
atop
those
islands
and
pillars,
almost
a
part
of
them,
its
curtain
wall
closing
off
the
headland
around
the
foot
of
the
great
stone
bridge
that
leapt
from
the
clifftop
to
the
largest
islet,
dominated
by
the
massive
bulk
of
the
Great
Keep.
Farther
out
were
the
Kitchen
Keep
and
the
Bloody
Keep,
each
on
its
own
island.
Towers
and
outbuildings
clung
to
the
stacks
beyond,
linked
to
each
other
by
covered
archways
when
the
pillars
stood
close,
by
long
swaying
walks
of
wood
and
rope
when
they
did
not.

The
Sea
Tower
rose
from
the
outmost
island
at
the
point
of
the
broken
sword,
the
oldest
part
of
the
castle,
round
and
tall,
the
sheer-sided
pillar
on
which
it
stood
half-eaten
through
by
the
endless
battering
of
the
waves.
The
base
of
the
tower
was
white
from
centuries
of
salt
spray,
the
upper
stories
green
from
the
lichen
that
crawled
over
it
like
a
thick
blanket,
the
jagged
crown
black
with
soot
from
its
nightly
watchfire.

Above
the
Sea
Tower
snapped
his
fatherвЂ™s
banner.
The
Myraham
was
too
far
off
for
Theon
to
see
more
than
the
cloth
itself,
but
he
knew
the
device
it
bore:
the
golden
kraken
of
House
Greyjoy,
arms
writhing
and
reaching
against
a
black
field.
The
banner
streamed
from
an
iron
mast,
shivering
and
twisting
as
the
wind
gusted,
like
a
bird
struggling
to
take
flight.
And
here
at
least
the
direwolf
of
Stark
did
not
fly
above,
casting
its
shadow
down
upon
the
Greyjoy
kraken.

Theon
had
never
seen
a
more
stirring
sight.
In
the
sky
behind
the
castle,
the
fine
red
tail
of
the
comet
was
visible
through
thin,
scuttling
clouds.
All
the
way
from
Riverrun
to
Seagard,
the
Mallisters
had
argued
about
its
meaning.
It
is
my
comet,
Theon
told
himself,
sliding
a
hand
into
his
fur-lined
cloak
to
touch
the
oilskin
pouch
snug
in
its
pocket.
Inside
was
the
letter
Robb
Stark
had
given
him,
paper
as
good
as
a
crown.

вЂњDoes
the
castle
look
as
you
remember
it,
milord?вЂќ
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
asked
as
she
pressed
herself
against
his
arm.

вЂњIt
looks
smaller,вЂќ
Theon
confessed,
вЂњthough
perhaps
that
is
only
the
distance.вЂќ
The
Myraham
was
a
fat-bellied
southron
merchanter
up
from
Oldtown,
carrying
wine
and
cloth
and
seed
to
trade
for
iron
ore.
Her
captain
was
a
fat-bellied
southron
merchanter
as
well,
and
the
stony
sea
that
foamed
at
the
feet
of
the
castle
made
his
plump
lips
quiver,
so
he
stayed
well
out,
farther
than
Theon
would
have
liked.
An
ironborn
captain
in
a
longship
would
have
taken
them
along
the
cliffs
and
under
the
high
bridge
that
spanned
the
gap
between
the
gatehouse
and
the
Great
Keep,
but
this
plump
Oldtowner
had
neither
the
craft,
the
crew,
nor
the
courage
to
attempt
such
a
thing.
So
they
sailed
past
at
a
safe
distance,
and
Theon
must
content
himself
with
seeing
Pyke
from
afar.
Even
so,
the
Myraham
had
to
struggle
mightily
to
keep
itself
off
those
rocks.

вЂњIt
must
be
windy
there,вЂќ
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
observed.

He
laughed.
вЂњWindy
and
cold
and
damp.
A
miserable
hard
place,
in
truthвЂ¦
but
my
lord
father
once
told
me
that
hard
places
breed
hard
men,
and
hard
men
rule
the
world.вЂќ

The
captainвЂ™s
face
was
as
green
as
the
sea
when
he
came
bowing
up
to
Theon
and
asked,
вЂњMay
we
make
for
port
now,
milord?вЂќ

вЂњYou
may,вЂќ
Theon
said,
a
faint
smile
playing
about
his
lips.
The
promise
of
gold
had
turned
the
Oldtowner
into
a
shameless
lickspittle.
It
would
have
been
a
much
different
voyage
if
a
longship
from
the
islands
had
been
waiting
at
Seagard
as
heвЂ™d
hoped.
Ironborn
captains
were
proud
and
willful,
and
did
not
go
in
awe
of
a
manвЂ™s
blood.
The
islands
were
too
small
for
awe,
and
a
longship
smaller
still.
If
every
captain
was
a
king
aboard
his
own
ship,
as
was
often
said,
it
was
small
wonder
they
named
the
islands
the
land
of
ten
thousand
kings.
And
when
you
have
seen
your
kings
shit
over
the
rail
and
turn
green
in
a
storm,
it
was
hard
to
bend
the
knee
and
pretend
they
were
gods.
вЂњThe
Drowned
God
makes
men,вЂќ
old
King
Urron
Redhand
had
once
said,
thousands
of
years
ago,
вЂњbut
itвЂ™s
men
who
make
crowns.вЂќ

A
longship
would
have
made
the
crossing
in
half
the
time
as
well.
The
Myraham
was
a
wallowing
tub,
if
truth
be
told,
and
he
would
not
care
to
be
aboard
her
in
a
storm.
Still,
Theon
could
not
be
too
unhappy.
He
was
here,
undrowned,
and
the
voyage
had
offered
certain
other
amusements.
He
put
an
arm
around
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter.
вЂњSummon
me
when
we
make
Lordsport,вЂќ
he
told
her
father.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
be
below,
in
my
cabin.вЂќ
He
led
the
girl
away
aft,
while
her
father
watched
them
go
in
sullen
silence.

The
cabin
was
the
captainвЂ™s,
in
truth,
but
it
had
been
turned
over
to
TheonвЂ™s
use
when
they
sailed
from
Seagard.
The
captainвЂ™s
daughter
had
not
been
turned
over
to
his
use,
but
she
had
come
to
his
bed
willingly
enough
all
the
same.
A
cup
of
wine,
a
few
whispers,
and
there
she
was.
The
girl
was
a
shade
plump
for
his
taste,
with
skin
as
splotchy
as
oatmeal,
but
her
breasts
filled
his
hands
nicely
and
she
had
been
a
maiden
the
first
time
he
took
her.
That
was
surprising
at
her
age,
but
Theon
found
it
diverting.
He
did
not
think
the
captain
approved,
and
that
was
amusing
as
well,
watching
the
man
struggle
to
swallow
his
outrage
while
performing
his
courtesies
to
the
high
lord,
the
rich
purse
of
gold
heвЂ™d
been
promised
never
far
from
his
thoughts.

As
Theon
shrugged
out
of
his
wet
cloak,
the
girl
said,
вЂњYou
must
be
so
happy
to
see
your
home
again,
milord.
How
many
years
have
you
been
away?
вЂњ

вЂњTen,
or
close
as
makes
no
matter,вЂќ
he
told
her.
вЂњI
was
a
boy
of
ten
when
I
was
taken
to
Winterfell.
as
a
ward
of
Eddard
Stark.вЂќ
A
ward
in
name,
a
hostage
in
truth.
Half
his
days
a
hostageвЂ¦
but
no
longer.
His
life
was
his
own
again,
and
nowhere
a
Stark
to
be
seen.
He
drew
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
close
and
kissed
her
on
her
ear.
вЂњTake
off
your
cloak.вЂќ

She
dropped
her
eyes,
suddenly
shy,
but
did
as
he
bid
her.
When
the
heavy
garment,
sodden
with
spray,
fell
from
her
shoulders
to
the
deck,
she
gave
him
a
little
bow
and
smiled
anxiously.
She
looked
rather
stupid
when
she
smiled,
but
he
had
never
required
a
woman
to
be
clever.
вЂњCome
here,вЂќ
he
told
her.

She
did.
вЂњI
have
never
seen
the
Iron
Islands.вЂќ

вЂњCount
yourself
fortunate.вЂќ
Theon
stroked
her
hair.
it
was
fine
and
dark,
though
the
wind
had
made
a
tangle
of
it.
вЂњThe
islands
are
stern
and
stony
places,
scant
of
comfort
and
bleak
of
prospect.
Death
is
never
far
here,
and
life
is
mean
and
meager.
Men
spend
their
nights
drinking
ale
and
arguing
over
whose
lot
is
worse,
the
fisherfolk
who
fight
the
sea
or
the
farmers
who
try
and
scratch
a
crop
from
the
poor
thin
soil.
If
truth
be
told,
the
miners
have
it
worse
than
either,
breaking
their
backs
down
in
the
dark,
and
for
what?
Iron,
lead,
tin,
those
are
our
treasures.
Small
wonder
the
ironmen
of
old
turned
to
raiding.вЂќ

The
stupid
girl
did
not
seem
to
be
listening.
вЂњI
could
go
ashore
with
you,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњI
would,
if
it
please
youвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
could
go
ashore,вЂќ
Theon
agreed,
squeezing
her
breast,
вЂњbut
not
with
me,
I
fear.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
work
in
your
castle,
milord.
I
can
clean
fish
and
bake
bread
and
churn
butter.
Father
says
my
peppercrab
stew
is
the
best
heвЂ™s
ever
tasted.
You
could
find
me
a
place
in
your
kitchens
and
I
could
make
you
peppercrab
stew.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
warm
my
bed
by
night?вЂќ
He
reached
for
the
laces
of
her
bodice
and
began
to
undo
them,
his
fingers
deft
and
practiced.
вЂњOnce
I
might
have
carried
you
home
as
a
prize,
and
kept
you
to
wife
whether
you
willed
it
or
no.
The
ironmen
of
old
did
such
things.
A
man
had
his
rock
wife,
his
true
bride,
ironborn
like
himself,
but
he
had
his
salt
wives
too,
women
captured
on
raids.вЂќ

The
girlвЂ™s
eyes
grew
wide,
and
not
because
he
had
bared
her
breasts.
вЂњI
would
be
your
salt
wife,
milord.вЂќ

вЂњI
fear
those
days
are
gone.вЂќ
TheonвЂ™s
finger
circled
one
heavy
teat,
spiraling
in
toward
the
fat
brown
nipple.
вЂњNo
longer
may
we
ride
the
wind
with
fire
and
sword,
taking
what
we
want.
Now
we
scratch
in
the
ground
and
toss
lines
in
the
sea
like
other
men,
and
count
ourselves
lucky
if
we
have
salt
cod
and
porridge
enough
to
get
us
through
a
winter.вЂќ
He
took
her
nipple
in
his
mouth,
and
bit
it
until
she
gasped.

вЂњYou
can
put
it
in
me
again,
if
it
please
you,вЂќ
she
whispered
in
his
ear
as
he
sucked.

When
he
raised
his
head
from
her
breast,
the
skin
was
dark
red
where
his
mouth
had
marked
her.
вЂњIt
would
please
me
to
teach
you
something
new.
Unlace
me
and
pleasure
me
with
your
mouth.вЂќ

вЂњWith
my
mouth?вЂќ

His
thumb
brushed
lightly
over
her
full
lips.
вЂњItвЂ™s
what
those
lips
were
made
for,
sweetling.
If
you
were
my
salt
wife,
youвЂ™d
do
as
I
command.вЂќ

She
was
timid
at
first,
but
learned
quickly
for
such
a
stupid
girl,
which
pleased
him.
Her
mouth
was
as
wet
and
sweet
as
her
cunt,
and
this
way
he
did
not
have
to
listen
to
her
mindless
prattle.
Once
I
would
have
kept
her
as
a
salt
wife
in
truth,
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
slid
his
fingers
through
her
tangled
hair.
Once.
When
we
still
kept
the
Old
Way,
lived
by
the
axe
instead
of
the
pick,
taking
what
we
would,
be
it
wealth,
women,
or
glory.
In
those
days,
the
ironborn
did
not
work
mines;
that
was
labor
for
the
captives
brought
back
from
the
hostings,
and
so
too
the
sorry
business
of
farming
and
tending
goats
and
sheep.
War
was
an
ironmanвЂ™s
proper
trade.
The
Drowned
God
had
made
them
to
reave
and
rape,
to
carve
out
kingdoms
and
write
their
names
in
fire
and
blood
and
song.

Aegon
the
Dragon
had
destroyed
the
Old
Way
when
he
burned
Black
Harren,
gave
HarrenвЂ™s
kingdom
back
to
the
weakling
rivermen,
and
reduced
the
Iron
Islands
to
an
insignificant
backwater
of
a
much
greater
realm.
Yet
the
old
red
tales
were
still
told
around
driftwood
fires
and
smoky
hearths
all
across
the
islands,
even
behind
the
high
stone
halls
of
Pyke.
TheonвЂ™s
father
numbered
among
his
titles
the
style
of
Lord
Reaper,
and
the
Greyjoy
words
boasted
that
We
Do
Not
Sow.

It
had
been
to
bring
back
the
Old
Way
more
than
for
the
empty
vanity
of
a
crown
that
Lord
Balon
had
staged
his
great
rebellion.
Robert
Baratheon
had
written
a
bloody
end
to
that
hope,
with
the
help
of
his
friend
Eddard
Stark,
but
both
men
were
dead
now.
Mere
boys
ruled
in
their
stead,
and
the
realm
that
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
forged
was
smashed
and
sundered.
This
is
the
season,
Theon
thought
as
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
slid
her
lips
up
and
down
the
length
of
him,
the
season,
the
year,
the
day,
and
I
am
the
man.
He
smiled
crookedly,
wondering
what
his
father
would
say
when
Theon
told
him
that
he,
the
last-born,
babe
and
hostage,
he
had
succeeded
where
Lord
Balon
himself
had
failed.

His
climax
came
on
him
sudden
as
a
storm,
and
he
filled
the
girlвЂ™s
mouth
with
his
seed.
Startled,
she
tried
to
pull
away,
but
Theon
held
her
tight
by
the
hair.
Afterward,
she
crawled
up
beside
him.
вЂњDid
I
please
milord?вЂќ

вЂњWell
enough,вЂќ
he
told
her.

вЂњIt
tasted
salty,вЂќ
she
murmured.

вЂњLike
the
sea?вЂќ

She
nodded.
вЂњI
have
always
loved
the
sea,
milord.вЂќ

вЂњAs
I
have,вЂќ
he
said,
rolling
her
nipple
idly
between
his
fingers.
It
was
true.
The
sea
meant
freedom
to
the
men
of
the
Iron
Islands.
He
had
forgotten
that
until
the
Myraham
had
raised
sail
at
Seagard.
The
sounds
brought
old
feelings
back;
the
creak
of
wood
and
rope,
the
captainвЂ™s
shouted
commands,
the
snap
of
the
sails
as
the
wind
filled
them,
each
as
familiar
as
the
beating
of
his
own
heart,
and
as
comforting.
I
must
remember
this,
Theon
vowed
to
himself.
I
must
never
go
far
from
the
sea
again.

вЂњTake
me
with
you,
milord,вЂќ
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
begged.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
need
to
go
to
your
castle.
I
can
stay
in
some
town,
and
be
your
salt
wife.вЂќ
She
reached
out
to
stroke
his
cheek.

Theon
Greyjoy
pushed
her
hand
aside
and
climbed
off
the
bunk.
вЂњMy
place
is
Pyke,
and
yours
is
on
this
ship.вЂќ

вЂњI
canвЂ™t
stay
here
now.вЂќ

He
laced
up
his
breeches.
вЂњWhy
not?вЂќ

вЂњMy
father,вЂќ
she
told
him.
вЂњOnce
youвЂ™re
gone,
heвЂ™ll
punish
me,
milord.
HeвЂ™ll
call
me
names
and
hit
me.вЂќ

Theon
swept
his
cloak
off
its
peg
and
over
his
shoulders.
вЂњFathers
are
like
that,вЂќ
he
admitted
as
he
pinned
the
folds
with
a
silver
clasp.
вЂњTell
him
he
should
be
pleased.
As
many
times
as
IвЂ™ve
fucked
you,
youвЂ™re
likely
with
child.
ItвЂ™s
not
every
man
who
has
the
honor
of
raising
a
kingвЂ™s
bastard.вЂќ
She
looked
at
him
stupidly,
so
he
left
her
there.

The
Myraham
was
rounding
a
wooded
point.
Below
the
pine-clad
bluffs,
a
dozen
fishing
boats
were
pulling
in
their
nets.
The
big
cog
stayed
well
out
from
them,
tacking.
Theon
moved
to
the
bow
for
a
better
view.
He
saw
the
castle
first,
the
stronghold
of
the
Botleys.
When
he
was
a
boy
it
had
been
timber
and
wattle,
but
Robert
Baratheon
had
razed
that
structure
to
the
ground.
Lord
Sawane
had
rebuilt
in
stone,
for
now
a
small
square
keep
crowned
the
hill.
Pale
green
flags
drooped
from
the
squat
corner
towers,
each
emblazoned
with
a
shoal
of
silvery
fish.

Beneath
the
dubious
protection
of
the
fish-ridden
little
castle
lay
the
village
of
Lordsport,
its
harbor
aswarm
with
ships.
When
last
heвЂ™d
seen
Lordsport,
it
had
been
a
smoking
wasteland,
the
skeletons
of
burnt
longships
and
smashed
galleys
littering
the
stony
shore
like
the
bones
of
dead
leviathans,
the
houses
no
more
than
broken
walls
and
cold
ashes.
After
ten
years,
few
traces
of
the
war
remained.
The
smallfolk
had
built
new
hovels
with
the
stones
of
the
old,
and
cut
fresh
sod
for
their
roofs.
A
new
inn
had
risen
beside
the
landing,
twice
the
size
of
the
old
one,
with
a
lower
story
of
cut
stone
and
two
upper
stories
of
timber.
The
sept
beyond
had
never
been
rebuilt,
though;
only
a
seven-sided
foundation
remained
where
it
had
stood.
Robert
BaratheonвЂ™s
fury
had
soured
the
ironmenвЂ™s
taste
for
the
new
gods,
it
would
seem.

Theon
was
more
interested
in
ships
than
gods.
Among
the
masts
of
countless
fishing
boats,
he
spied
a
Tyroshi
trading
galley
off-loading
beside
a
lumbering
Ibbenese
cog
with
her
black-tarred
hull.
A
great
number
of
longships,
fifty
or
sixty
at
the
least,
stood
out
to
sea
or
lay
beached
on
the
pebbled
shore
to
the
north.
Some
of
the
sails
bore
devices
from
the
other
islands;
the
blood
moon
of
Wynch,
Lord
GoodbrotherвЂ™s
banded
black
warhorn,
HarlawвЂ™s
silver
scythe.
Theon
searched
for
his
uncle
EuronвЂ™s
Silence.
Of
that
lean
and
terrible
red
ship
he
saw
no
sign,
but
his
fatherвЂ™s
Great
Kraken
was
there,
her
bow
ornamented
with
a
grey
iron
ram
in
the
shape
of
its
namesake.

Had
Lord
Balon
anticipated
him
and
called
the
Greyjoy
banners?
His
hand
went
inside
his
cloak
again,
to
the
oilskin
pouch.
No
one
knew
of
his
letter
but
Robb
Stark;
they
were
no
fools,
to
entrust
their
secrets
to
a
bird.
Still,
Lord
Balon
was
no
fool
either.
He
might
well
have
guessed
why
his
son
was
coming
home
at
long
last,
and
acted
accordingly.

The
thought
did
not
please
him.
His
fatherвЂ™s
war
was
long
done,
and
lost.
This
was
TheonвЂ™s
hourвЂ”his
plan,
his
glory,
and
in
time
his
crown.
Yet
if
the
longships
are
hostingвЂ¦

It
might
be
only
a
caution,
now
that
he
thought
on
it.
A
defensive
move,
lest
the
war
spill
out
across
the
sea.
Old
men
were
cautious
by
nature.
His
father
was
old
now,
and
so
too
his
uncle
Victarion,
who
commanded
the
Iron
Fleet.
His
uncle
Euron
was
a
different
song,
to
be
sure,
but
the
Silence
did
not
seem
to
be
in
port.
ItвЂ™s
all
for
the
good,
Theon
told
himself.
This
way,
I
shall
be
able
to
strike
all
the
more
quickly.

As
the
Myraham
made
her
way
landward,
Theon
paced
the
deck
restlessly,
scanning
the
shore.
He
had
not
thought
to
find
Lord
Balon
himself
at
quayside,
but
surely
his
father
would
have
sent
someone
to
meet
him.
Sylas
Sourmouth
the
steward,
Lord
Botley,
perhaps
even
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.
It
would
be
good
to
look
on
DagmerвЂ™s
hideous
old
face
again.
It
was
not
as
though
they
had
no
word
of
his
arrival.
Robb
had
sent
ravens
from
Riverrun,
and
when
theyвЂ™d
found
no
longship
at
Seagard,
Jason
Mallister
had
sent
his
own
birds
to
Pyke,
supposing
that
RobbвЂ™s
were
lost.

Yet
he
saw
no
familiar
faces,
no
honor
guard
waiting
to
escort
him
from
Lordsport
to
Pyke,
only
smallfolk
going
about
their
small
business.
Shorehands
rolled
casks
of
wine
off
the
Tyroshi
trader,
fisherfolk
cried
the
dayвЂ™s
catch,
children
ran
and
played.
A
priest
in
the
seawater
robes
of
the
Drowned
God
was
leading
a
pair
of
horses
along
the
pebbled
shore,
while
above
him
a
slattern
leaned
out
a
window
in
the
inn,
calling
out
to
some
passing
Ibbenese
sailors.

A
handful
of
Lordsport
merchants
had
gathered
to
meet
the
ship.
They
shouted
questions
as
the
Myraham
was
tying
up.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
out
of
Oldtown,вЂќ
the
captain
called
down,
вЂњbearing
apples
and
oranges,
wines
from
the
Arbor,
feathers
from
the
Summer
Isles.
I
have
pepper,
woven
leathers,
a
bolt
of
Myrish
lace,
mirrors
for
milady,
a
pair
of
Oldtown
woodharps
sweet
as
any
you
ever
heard.вЂќ
The
gangplank
descended
with
a
creak
and
a
thud.
вЂњAnd
IвЂ™ve
brought
your
heir
back
to
you.вЂќ

The
Lordsport
men
gazed
on
Theon
with
blank,
bovine
eyes,
and
he
realized
that
they
did
not
know
who
he
was.
It
made
him
angry.
He
pressed
a
golden
dragon
into
the
captainвЂ™s
palm.
вЂњHave
your
men
bring
my
things.вЂќ
Without
waiting
for
a
reply,
he
strode
down
the
gangplank.
вЂњInnkeeper,вЂќ
he
barked,
вЂњI
require
a
horse.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
mвЂ™lord,вЂќ
the
man
responded,
without
so
much
as
a
bow.
He
had
forgotten
how
bold
the
ironborn
could
be.
вЂњHappens
as
I
have
one
might
do.
Where
would
you
be
riding,
mвЂ™lord?вЂќ

вЂњPyke.вЂќ
The
fool
still
did
not
know
him.
He
should
have
worn
his
good
doublet,
with
the
kraken
embroidered
on
the
breast.

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
want
to
be
off
soon,
to
reach
Pyke
afore
dark,вЂќ
the
innkeeper
said.
вЂњMy
boy
will
go
with
you
and
show
you
the
way.вЂќ

вЂњYour
boy
will
not
be
needed,вЂќ
a
deep
voice
called,
вЂњnor
your
horse.
I
shall
see
my
nephew
back
to
his
fatherвЂ™s
house.вЂќ

The
speaker
was
the
priest
he
had
seen
leading
the
horses
along
the
shoreline.
As
the
man
approached,
the
smallfolk
bent
the
knee,
and
Theon
heard
the
innkeeper
murmur,
вЂњDamphair.вЂќ

Tall
and
thin,
with
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
beak
of
a
nose,
the
priest
was
garbed
in
mottled
robes
of
green
and
grey
and
blue,
the
swirling
colors
of
the
Drowned
God.
A
waterskin
hung
under
his
arm
on
a
leather
strap,
and
ropes
of
dried
seaweed
were
braided
through
his
waist-long
black
hair
and
untrimmed
beard.

A
memory
prodded
at
Theon.
in
one
of
his
rare
curt
letters,
Lord
Balon
had
written
of
his
youngest
brother
going
down
in
a
storm,
and
turning
holy
when
he
washed
up
safe
on
shore.
вЂњUncle
Aeron?вЂќ
he
said
doubtfully.

вЂњNephew
Theon,вЂќ
the
priest
replied.
вЂњYour
lord
father
bid
me
fetch
you.
Come.вЂќ

вЂњIn
a
moment,
Uncle.вЂќ
He
turned
back
to
the
Myraham.
вЂњMy
things,вЂќ
he
commanded
the
captain.

A
sailor
fetched
him
down
his
tall
yew
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows,
but
it
was
the
captainвЂ™s
daughter
who
brought
the
pack
with
his
good
clothing.
вЂњMilord.вЂќ
Her
eyes
were
red.
When
he
took
the
pack,
she
made
as
if
to
embrace
him,
there
in
front
of
her
own
father
and
his
priestly
uncle
and
half
the
island.

Theon
turned
deftly
aside.
вЂњYou
have
my
thanks.вЂќ

вЂњPlease,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњI
do
love
you
well,
milord.вЂќ

вЂњI
must
go.вЂќ
He
hurried
after
his
uncle,
who
was
already
well
down
the
pier.
Theon
caught
him
with
a
dozen
long
strides.
вЂњI
had
not
looked
for
you,
Uncle.
After
ten
years,
I
thought
perhaps
my
lord
father
and
lady
mother
might
come
themselves,
or
send
Dagmer
with
an
honor
guard.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
not
for
you
to
question
the
commands
of
the
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke.вЂќ
The
priestвЂ™s
manner
was
chilly,
most
unlike
the
man
Theon
remembered.
Aeron
Greyjoy
had
been
the
most
amiable
of
his
uncles,
feckless
and
quick
to
laugh,
fond
of
songs,
ale,
and
women.
вЂњAs
to
Dagmer,
the
Cleftjaw
is
gone
to
Old
Wyk
at
your
fatherвЂ™s
behest,
to
roust
the
Stonehouses
and
the
Drumms.вЂќ

вЂњTo
what
purpose?
Why
are
the
longships
hosting?вЂќ

вЂњWhy
have
longships
ever
hosted?вЂќ
His
uncle
had
left
the
horses
tied
up
in
front
of
the
waterside
inn.
When
they
reached
them,
he
turned
to
Theon.
вЂњTell
me
true,
nephew.
Do
you
pray
to
the
wolf
gods
now?вЂќ

Theon
seldom
prayed
at
all,
but
that
was
not
something
you
confessed
to
a
priest,
even
your
fatherвЂ™s
own
brother.
вЂњNed
Stark
prayed
to
a
tree.
No,
I
care
nothing
for
StarkвЂ™s
gods.вЂќ

вЂњGood.
Kneel.вЂќ

The
ground
was
all
stones
and
mud.
вЂњUncle,
IвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњKneel.
Or
are
you
too
proud
now,
a
lordling
of
the
green
lands
come
among
us?вЂќ

Theon
knelt.
He
had
a
purpose
here,
and
might
need
AeronвЂ™s
help
to
achieve
it.
A
crown
was
worth
a
little
mud
and
horseshit
on
his
breeches,
he
supposed.

вЂњBow
your
head.вЂќ
Lifting
the
skin,
his
uncle
pulled
the
cork
and
directed
a
thin
stream
of
seawater
down
upon
TheonвЂ™s
head.
It
drenched
his
hair
and
ran
over
his
forehead
into
his
eyes.
Sheets
washed
down
his
cheeks,
and
a
finger
crept
under
his
cloak
and
doublet
and
down
his
back,
a
cold
rivulet
along
his
spine.
The
salt
made
his
eyes
burn,
until
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
cry
out.
He
could
taste
the
ocean
on
his
lips.
вЂњLet
Theon
your
servant
be
born
again
from
the
sea,
as
you
were,вЂќ
Aeron
Greyjoy
intoned.
вЂњBless
him
with
salt,
bless
him
with
stone,
bless
him
with
steel.
Nephew,
do
you
still
know
the
words?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
is
dead
may
never
die,вЂќ
Theon
said,
remembering.

вЂњWhat
is
dead
may
never
die,вЂќ
his
uncle
echoed,
вЂњbut
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger.
Stand.вЂќ

Theon
stood,
blinking
back
tears
from
the
salt
in
his
eyes.
Wordless,
his
uncle
corked
the
waterskin,
untied
his
horse,
and
mounted.
Theon
did
the
same.
They
set
off
together,
leaving
the
inn
and
the
harbor
behind
them,
up
past
the
castle
of
Lord
Botley
into
the
stony
hills.
The
priest
ventured
no
further
word.

вЂњI
have
been
half
my
life
away
from
home,вЂќ
Theon
ventured
at
last.
вЂњWill
I
find
the
islands
changed?вЂќ

вЂњMen
fish
the
sea,
dig
in
the
earth,
and
die.
Women
birth
children
in
blood
and
pain,
and
die.
Night
follows
day.
The
winds
and
tides
remain.
The
islands
are
as
our
god
made
them.вЂќ

Gods,
he
has
grown
grim,
Theon
thought.
вЂњWill
I
find
my
sister
and
my
lady
mother
at
Pyke?вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
not.
Your
mother
dwells
on
Harlaw,
with
her
own
sister.
It
is
less
raw
there,
and
her
cough
troubles
her.
Your
sister
has
taken
Black
Wind
to
Great
Wyk,
with
messages
from
your
lord
father.
She
will
return
eвЂ™er
long,
you
may
be
sure.вЂќ

Theon
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
Black
Wind
was
AshaвЂ™s
longship.
He
had
not
seen
his
sister
in
ten
years,
but
that
much
he
knew
of
her.
Odd
that
she
would
call
it
that,
when
Robb
Stark
had
a
wolf
named
Grey
Wind.
вЂњStark
is
grey
and
GreyjoyвЂ™s
black,вЂќ
he
murmured,
smiling,
вЂњbut
it
seems
weвЂ™re
both
windy.вЂќ

The
priest
had
nothing
to
say
to
that.

вЂњAnd
what
of
you,
Uncle?вЂќ
Theon
asked.
вЂњYou
were
no
priest
when
I
was
taken
from
Pyke.
I
remember
how
you
would
sing
the
old
reaving
songs
standing
on
the
table
with
a
horn
of
ale
in
hand.вЂќ

вЂњYoung
I
was,
and
vain,вЂќ
Aeron
Greyjoy
said,
вЂњbut
the
sea
washed
my
follies
and
my
vanities
away.
That
man
drowned,
nephew.
His
lungs
filled
with
seawater,
and
the
fish
ate
the
scales
off
his
eyes.
When
I
rose
again,
I
saw
clearly.вЂќ

He
is
as
mad
as
he
is
sour.
Theon
had
liked
what
he
remembered
of
the
old
Aeron
Greyjoy.
вЂњUncle,
why
has
my
father
called
his
swords
and
sails?вЂќ

вЂњDoubtless
he
will
tell
you
at
Pyke.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
know
his
plans
now.вЂќ

вЂњFrom
me,
you
shall
not.
We
are
commanded
not
to
speak
of
this
to
any
man.вЂќ

вЂњEven
to
me?вЂќ
TheonвЂ™s
anger
flared.
HeвЂ™d
led
men
in
war,
hunted
with
a
king,
won
honor
in
tourney
melees,
ridden
with
Brynden
Blackfish
and
Greatjon
Umber,
fought
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
bedded
more
girls
than
he
could
name,
and
yet
this
uncle
was
treating
him
as
though
he
were
still
a
child
of
ten.
вЂњIf
my
father
makes
plans
for
war,
I
must
know
of
them.
I
am
not
вЂany
man,вЂ™
I
am
heir
to
Pyke
and
the
Iron
Islands.вЂќ

вЂњAs
to
that,вЂќ
his
uncle
said,
вЂњwe
shall
see.вЂќ

The
words
were
a
slap
in
the
face.
вЂњWe
shall
see?
My
brothers
are
both
dead.
I
am
my
lord
fatherвЂ™s
only
living
son.вЂќ

вЂњYour
sister
lives.вЂќ

Asha,
he
thought,
confounded.
She
was
three
years
older
than
Theon,
yet
stillвЂ¦вЂњA
woman
may
inherit
only
if
there
is
no
male
heir
in
the
direct
line,вЂќ
he
insisted
loudly.
вЂњI
will
not
be
cheated
of
my
rights,
I
warn
you.вЂќ

His
uncle
grunted.
вЂњYou
warn
a
servant
of
the
Drowned
God,
boy?
You
have
forgotten
more
than
you
know.
And
you
are
a
great
fool
if
you
believe
your
lord
father
will
ever
hand
these
holy
islands
over
to
a
Stark.
Now
be
silent.
The
ride
is
long
enough
without
your
magpie
chatterings.вЂќ

Theon
held
his
tongue,
though
not
without
struggle.
So
that
is
the
way
of
it,
he
thought.
As
if
ten
years
in
Winterfell
could
make
a
Stark.
Lord
Eddard
had
raised
him
among
his
own
children,
but
Theon
had
never
been
one
of
them.
The
whole
castle,
from
Lady
Stark
to
the
lowliest
kitchen
scullion,
knew
he
was
hostage
to
his
fatherвЂ™s
good
behavior,
and
treated
him
accordingly.
Even
the
bastard
Jon
Snow
had
been
accorded
more
honor
than
he
had.

Lord
Eddard
had
tried
to
play
the
father
from
time
to
time,
but
to
Theon
he
had
always
remained
the
man
whoвЂ™d
brought
blood
and
fire
to
Pyke
and
taken
him
from
his
home.
As
a
boy,
he
had
lived
in
fear
of
StarkвЂ™s
stern
face
and
great
dark
sword.
His
wife
was,
if
anything,
even
more
distant
and
suspicious.

As
for
their
children,
the
younger
ones
had
been
mewling
babes
for
most
of
his
years
at
Winterfell.
Only
Robb
and
his
baseborn
half
brother
Jon
Snow
had
been
old
enough
to
be
worth
his
notice.
The
bastard
was
a
sullen
boy,
quick
to
sense
a
slight,
jealous
of
TheonвЂ™s
high
birth
and
RobbвЂ™s
regard
for
him.
For
Robb
himself,
Theon
did
have
a
certain
affection,
as
for
a
younger
brotherвЂ¦
but
it
would
be
best
not
to
mention
that.
In
Pyke,
it
would
seem,
the
old
wars
were
still
being
fought.
That
ought
not
surprise
him.
The
Iron
Islands
lived
in
the
past;
the
present
was
too
hard
and
bitter
to
be
borne.
Besides,
his
father
and
uncles
were
old,
and
the
old
lords
were
like
that;
they
took
their
dusty
feuds
to
the
grave,
forgetting
nothing
and
forgiving
less.

It
had
been
the
same
with
the
Mallisters,
his
companions
on
the
ride
from
Riverrun
to
Seagard.
Patrek
Mallister
was
not
too
ill
a
fellow;
they
shared
a
taste
for
wenches,
wine,
and
hawking.
But
when
old
Lord
Jason
saw
his
heir
growing
overly
fond
of
TheonвЂ™s
company,
he
had
taken
Patrek
aside
to
remind
him
that
Seagard
had
been
built
to
defend
the
coast
against
reavers
from
the
Iron
islands,
the
Greyjoys
of
Pyke
chief
among
them.
Their
Booming
Tower
was
named
for
its
immense
bronze
bell,
rung
of
old
to
call
the
townsfolk
and
farmhands
into
the
castle
when
longships
were
sighted
on
the
western
horizon.

вЂњNever
mind
that
the
bell
has
been
rung
just
once
in
three
hundred
years,вЂќ
Patrek
had
told
Theon
the
day
after,
as
he
shared
his
fatherвЂ™s
cautions
and
a
jug
of
green-apple
wine.

вЂњWhen
my
brother
stormed
Seagard,вЂќ
Theon
said.
Lord
Jason
had
slain
Rodrik
Greyjoy
under
the
walls
of
the
castle,
and
thrown
the
ironmen
back
into
the
bay.
вЂњIf
your
father
supposes
I
bear
him
some
enmity
for
that,
itвЂ™s
only
because
he
never
knew
Rodrik.вЂќ

They
had
a
laugh
over
that
as
they
raced
ahead
to
an
amorous
young
millerвЂ™s
wife
that
Patrek
knew.
Would
that
Patrek
were
with
me
now.
Mallister
or
no,
he
was
a
more
amiable
riding
companion
than
this
sour
old
priest
that
his
uncle
Aeron
had
turned
into.

The
path
they
rode
wound
up
and
up,
into
bare
and
stony
hills.
Soon
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
sea,
though
the
smell
of
salt
still
hung
sharp
in
the
damp
air.
They
kept
a
steady
plodding
pace,
past
a
shepherdвЂ™s
croft
and
the
abandoned
workings
of
a
mine.
This
new,
holy
Aeron
Greyjoy
was
not
much
for
talk.
They
rode
in
a
gloom
of
silence.
Finally
Theon
could
suffer
it
no
longer.
вЂњRobb
Stark
is
Lord
of
Winterfell
now,вЂќ
he
said.

Aeron
rode
on.
вЂњOne
wolf
is
much
like
the
other.вЂќ

вЂњRobb
has
broken
fealty
with
the
Iron
Throne
and
crowned
himself
King
in
the
North.
ThereвЂ™s
war.вЂќ

вЂњThe
maesterвЂ™s
ravens
fly
over
salt
as
soon
as
rock.
This
news
is
old
and
cold.вЂќ

вЂњIt
means
a
new
day,
Uncle.вЂќ

вЂњEvery
morning
brings
a
new
day,
much
like
the
old.вЂќ

вЂњIn
Riverrun,
they
would
tell
you
different.
They
say
the
red
comet
is
a
herald
of
a
new
age.
A
messenger
from
the
gods.вЂќ

вЂњA
sign
it
is,вЂќ
the
priest
agreed,
вЂњbut
from
our
god,
not
theirs.
A
burning
brand
it
is,
such
as
our
people
carried
of
old.
It
is
the
flame
the
Drowned
God
brought
from
the
sea,
and
it
proclaims
a
rising
tide.
It
is
time
to
hoist
our
sails
and
go
forth
into
the
world
with
fire
and
sword,
as
he
did.вЂќ

Theon
smiled.
вЂњI
could
not
agree
more.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
agrees
with
god
as
a
raindrop
with
the
storm.вЂќ

This
raindrop
will
one
day
be
a
king,
old
man.
Theon
had
suffered
quite
enough
of
his
uncleвЂ™s
gloom.
He
put
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
trotted
on
ahead,
smiling.

It
was
nigh
on
sunset
when
they
reached
the
walls
of
Pyke,
a
crescent
of
dark
stone
that
ran
from
cliff
to
cliff,
with
the
gatehouse
in
the
center
and
three
square
towers
to
either
side.
Theon
could
still
make
out
the
scars
left
by
the
stones
of
Robert
BaratheonвЂ™s
catapults.
A
new
south
tower
had
risen
from
the
ruins
of
the
old,
its
stone
a
paler
shade
of
grey,
and
as
yet
unmarred
by
patches
of
lichen.
That
was
where
Robert
had
made
his
breach,
swarming
in
over
the
rubble
and
corpses
with
his
warharnmer
in
hand
and
Ned
Stark
at
his
side.
Theon
had
watched
from
the
safety
of
the
Sea
Tower,
and
sometimes
he
still
saw
the
torches
in
his
dreams,
and
heard
the
dull
thunder
of
the
collapse.

The
gates
stood
open
to
him,
the
rusted
iron
portcullis
drawn
up.
The
guards
atop
the
battlements
watched
with
strangersвЂ™
eyes
as
Theon
Greyjoy
came
home
at
last.

Beyond
the
curtain
wall
were
half
a
hundred
acres
of
headland
hard
against
the
sky
and
the
sea.
The
stables
were
here,
and
the
kennels,
and
a
scatter
of
other
outbuildings.
Sheep
and
swine
huddled
in
their
pens
while
the
castle
dogs
ran
free.
To
the
south
were
the
cliffs,
and
the
wide
stone
bridge
to
the
Great
Keep.
Theon
could
hear
the
crashing
of
waves
as
he
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
A
stableman
came
to
take
his
horse.
A
pair
of
gaunt
children
and
some
thralls
stared
at
him
with
dull
eyes,
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
lord
father,
nor
anyone
else
he
recalled
from
boyhood.
A
bleak
and
bitter
homecoming,
he
thought.

The
priest
had
not
dismounted.
вЂњWill
you
not
stay
the
night
and
share
our
meat
and
mead,
Uncle?вЂќ

вЂњBring
you,
I
was
told.
You
are
brought.
Now
I
return
to
our
godвЂ™s
business.вЂќ
Aeron
Greyjoy
turned
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
out
beneath
the
muddy
spikes
of
the
portcullis.

A
bentback
old
crone
in
a
shapeless
grey
dress
approached
him
warily.
вЂњMвЂ™lord,
I
am
sent
to
show
you
to
chambers.вЂќ

вЂњBy
whose
bidding?вЂќ

вЂњYour
lord
father,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

Theon
pulled
off
his
gloves.
вЂњSo
you
do
know
who
I
am.
Why
is
my
father
not
here
to
greet
me?вЂќ

вЂњHe
awaits
you
in
the
Sea
Tower,
mвЂ™lord.
When
you
are
rested
from
your
trip.вЂќ

And
I
thought
Ned
Stark
cold.
вЂњAnd
who
are
you?вЂќ

вЂњHelya,
who
keeps
this
castle
for
your
lord
father.вЂќ

вЂњSylas
was
steward
here.
They
called
him
Sourmouth.вЂќ
Even
now,
Theon
could
recall
the
winey
stench
of
the
old
manвЂ™s
breath.

вЂњDead
these
five
years,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
of
Maester
Qalen,
where
is
he?вЂќ

вЂњHe
sleeps
in
the
sea.
Wendamyr
keeps
the
ravens
now.вЂќ

It
is
as
if
I
were
a
stranger
here,
Theon
thought.
Nothing
has
changed,
and
yet
everything
has
changed.
вЂњShow
me
to
my
chambers,
woman,вЂќ
he
commanded.
Bowing
stiffly,
she
led
him
across
the
headland
to
the
bridge.
That
at
least
was
as
he
remembered;
the
ancient
stones
slick
with
spray
and
spotted
by
lichen,
the
sea
foaming
under
their
feet
like
some
great
wild
beast,
the
salt
wind
clutching
at
their
clothes.

Whenever
heвЂ™d
imagined
his
homecoming,
he
had
always
pictured
himself
returning
to
the
snug
bedchamber
in
the
Sea
Tower,
where
heвЂ™d
slept
as
a
child.
Instead
the
old
woman
led
him
to
the
Bloody
Keep.
The
halls
here
were
larger
and
better
furnished,
if
no
less
cold
nor
damp.
Theon
was
given
a
suite
of
chilly
rooms
with
ceilings
so
high
that
they
were
lost
in
gloom.
He
might
have
been
more
impressed
if
he
had
not
known
that
these
were
the
very
chambers
that
had
given
the
Bloody
Keep
its
name.
A
thousand
years
before,
the
sons
of
the
River
King
had
been
slaughtered
here,
hacked
to
bits
in
their
beds
so
that
pieces
of
their
bodies
might
be
sent
back
to
their
father
on
the
mainland.

But
Greyjoys
were
not
murdered
in
Pyke
except
once
in
a
great
while
by
their
brothers,
and
his
brothers
were
both
dead.
It
was
not
fear
of
ghosts
that
made
him
glance
about
with
distaste.
The
wall
hangings
were
green
with
mildew,
the
mattress
musty-smelling
and
sagging,
the
rushes
old
and
brittle.
Years
had
come
and
gone
since
these
chambers
had
last
been
opened.
The
damp
went
bone
deep.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
a
basin
of
hot
water
and
a
fire
in
this
hearth,вЂќ
he
told
the
crone.
вЂњSee
that
they
light
braziers
in
the
other
rooms
to
drive
out
some
of
the
chill.
And
gods
be
good,
get
someone
in
here
at
once
to
change
these
rushes.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
mвЂ™lord.
As
you
command.вЂќ
She
fled.

After
some
time,
they
brought
the
hot
water
he
had
asked
for.
It
was
only
tepid,
and
soon
cold,
and
seawater
in
the
bargain,
but
it
served
to
wash
the
dust
of
the
long
ride
from
his
face
and
hair
and
hands.
While
two
thralls
lit
his
braziers,
Theon
stripped
off
his
travel-stained
clothing
and
dressed
to
meet
his
father.
He
chose
boots
of
supple
black
leather,
soft
lambswool
breeches
of
silvery-grey,
a
black
velvet
doublet
with
the
golden
kraken
of
the
Greyjoys
embroidered
on
the
breast.
Around
his
throat
he
fastened
a
slender
gold
chain,
around
his
waist
a
belt
of
bleached
white
leather.
He
hung
a
dirk
at
one
hip
and
a
longsword
at
the
other,
in
scabbards
striped
black-and-gold.
Drawing
the
dirk,
he
tested
its
edge
with
his
thumb,
pulled
a
whetstone
from
his
belt
pouch,
and
gave
it
a
few
licks.
He
prided
himself
on
keeping
his
weapons
sharp.
вЂњWhen
I
return,
I
shall
expect
a
warm
room
and
clean
rushes,вЂќ
he
warned
the
thralls
as
he
drew
on
a
pair
of
black
gloves,
the
silk
decorated
with
a
delicate
scrollwork
tracery
in
golden
thread.

Theon
returned
to
the
Great
Keep
through
a
covered
stone
walkway,
the
echoes
of
his
footsteps
mingling
with
the
ceaseless
rumble
of
the
sea
below.
To
get
to
the
Sea
Tower
on
its
crooked
pillar,
he
had
to
cross
three
further
bridges,
each
narrower
than
the
one
before.
The
last
was
made
of
rope
and
wood,
and
the
wet
salt
wind
made
it
sway
underfoot
like
a
living
thing.
TheonвЂ™s
heart
was
in
his
mouth
by
the
time
he
was
halfway
across.
A
long
way
below,
the
waves
threw
up
tall
plumes
of
spray
as
they
crashed
against
the
rock.
As
a
boy,
he
used
to
run
across
this
bridge,
even
in
the
black
of
night.
Boys
believe
nothing
can
hurt
them,
his
doubt
whispered.
Grown
men
know
better.

The
door
was
grey
wood
studded
with
iron,
and
Theon
found
it
barred
from
the
inside.
He
hammered
on
it
with
a
fist,
and
cursed
when
a
splinter
snagged
the
fabric
of
his
glove.
The
wood
was
damp
and
moldy,
the
iron
studs
rusted.

After
a
moment
the
door
was
opened
from
within
by
a
guard
in
a
black
iron
breastplate
and
pothelm.
вЂњYou
are
the
son?вЂќ

вЂњOut
of
my
way,
or
youвЂ™ll
learn
who
I
am.вЂќ
The
man
stood
aside.
Theon
climbed
the
twisting
steps
to
the
solar.
He
found
his
father
seated
beside
a
brazier,
beneath
a
robe
of
musty
sealskins
that
covered
him
foot
to
chin.
At
the
sound
of
boots
on
stone,
the
Lord
of
the
Iron
Islands
lifted
his
eyes
to
behold
his
last
living
son.
He
was
smaller
than
Theon
remembered
him.
And
so
gaunt.
Balon
Greyjoy
had
always
been
thin,
but
now
he
looked
as
though
the
gods
had
put
him
in
a
cauldron
and
boiled
every
spare
ounce
of
flesh
from
his
bones,
until
nothing
remained
but
hair
and
skin.
Bone
thin
and
bone
hard
he
was,
with
a
face
that
might
have
been
chipped
from
flint.
His
eyes
were
flinty
too,
black
and
sharp,
but
the
years
and
the
salt
winds
had
turned
his
hair
the
grey
of
a
winter
sea,
flecked
with
whitecaps.
Unbound,
it
hung
past
the
small
of
the
back.

вЂњNine
years,
is
it?вЂќ
Lord
Balon
said
at
last.

вЂњTen,вЂќ
Theon
answered,
pulling
off
his
torn
gloves.

вЂњA
boy
they
took,вЂќ
his
father
said.
вЂњWhat
are
you
now?вЂќ

вЂњA
man,вЂќ
Theon
answered.
вЂњYour
blood
and
your
heir.вЂќ

Lord
Balon
grunted.
вЂњWe
shall
see.вЂќ

вЂњYou
shall,вЂќ
Theon
promised.

вЂњTen
years,
you
say.
Stark
had
you
as
long
as
I.
And
now
you
come
as
his
envoy.вЂќ

вЂњNot
his,вЂќ
Theon
said.
вЂњLord
Eddard
is
dead,
beheaded
by
the
Lannister
queen.вЂќ

вЂњThey
are
both
dead,
Stark
and
that
Robert
who
broke
my
walls
with
his
stones.
I
vowed
IвЂ™d
live
to
see
them
both
in
their
graves,
and
I
have.вЂќ
He
grimaced.
вЂњYet
the
cold
and
the
damp
still
make
my
joints
ache,
as
when
they
were
alive.
So
what
does
it
serve?вЂќ

вЂњIt
serves.вЂќ
Theon
moved
closer.
вЂњI
bring
a
letterвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDid
Ned
Stark
dress
you
like
that?вЂќ
his
father
interrupted,
squinting
up
from
beneath
his
robe.
вЂњWas
it
his
pleasure
to
garb
you
in
velvets
and
silks
and
make
you
his
own
sweet
daughter?вЂќ

Theon
felt
the
blood
rising
to
his
face.
вЂњI
am
no
manвЂ™s
daughter.
If
you
mislike
my
garb,
I
will
change
it.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will.вЂќ
Throwing
off
the
furs,
Lord
Balon
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
not
so
tall
as
Theon
remembered.
вЂњThat
bauble
around
your
neckвЂ”was
it
bought
with
gold
or
iron?вЂќ

Theon
touched
the
gold
chain.
He
had
forgotten.
It
has
been
so
longвЂ¦
In
the
Old
Way,
women
might
decorate
themselves
with
ornaments
bought
with
coin,
but
a
warrior
wore
only
the
jewelry
he
took
off
the
corpses
of
enemies
slain
by
his
own
hand.
Paying
the
iron
price,
it
was
called.

вЂњYou
blush
red
as
a
maid,
Theon.
A
question
was
asked.
Is
it
the
gold
price
you
paid,
or
the
iron?вЂќ

вЂњThe
gold,вЂќ
Theon
admitted.

His
father
slid
his
fingers
under
the
necklace
and
gave
it
a
yank
so
hard
it
was
like
to
take
TheonвЂ™s
head
off,
had
the
chain
not
snapped
first.
вЂњMy
daughter
has
taken
an
axe
for
a
lover,вЂќ
Lord
Balon
said.
вЂњI
will
not
have
my
son
bedeck
himself
like
a
whore.вЂќ
He
dropped
the
broken
chain
onto
the
brazier,
where
it
slid
down
among
the
coals.
вЂњIt
is
as
I
feared.
The
green
lands
have
made
you
soft,
and
the
Starks
have
made
you
theirs.
вЂњ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
wrong.
Ned
Stark
was
my
gaoler,
but
my
blood
is
still
salt
and
iron.вЂќ

Lord
Balon
turned
away
to
warm
his
bony
hands
over
the
brazier.
вЂњYet
the
Stark
pup
sends
you
to
me
like
a
well-trained
raven,
clutching
his
little
message.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
nothing
small
about
the
letter
I
bear,вЂќ
Theon
said,
вЂњand
the
offer
he
makes
is
one
I
suggested
to
him.вЂќ

вЂњThis
wolf
king
heeds
your
counsel,
does
he?вЂќ
The
notion
seemed
to
amuse
Lord
Balon.

вЂњHe
heeds
me,
yes.
IвЂ™ve
hunted
with
him,
trained
with
him,
shared
meat
and
mead
with
him,
warred
at
his
side.
I
have
earned
his
trust.
He
looks
on
me
as
an
older
brother,
heвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
His
father
jabbed
a
finger
at
his
face.
вЂњNot
here,
not
in
Pyke,
not
in
my
hearing,
you
will
not
name
him
brother,
this
son
of
the
man
who
put
your
true
brothers
to
the
sword.
Or
have
you
forgotten
Rodrik
and
Maron,
who
were
your
own
blood?вЂќ

вЂњI
forget
nothing.вЂќ
Ned
Stark
had
killed
neither
of
his
brothers,
in
truth.
Rodrik
had
been
slain
by
Lord
Jason
Mallister
at
Seagard,
Maron
crushed
in
the
collapse
of
the
old
south
towerвЂ¦
but
Stark
would
have
done
for
them
just
as
quick
had
the
tide
of
battle
chanced
to
sweep
them
together.
вЂњI
remember
my
brothers
very
well,вЂќ
Theon
insisted.
Chiefly
he
remembered
RodrikвЂ™s
drunken
cuffs
and
MaronвЂ™s
cruel
japes
and
endless
lies.
вЂњI
remember
when
my
father
was
a
king
too.вЂќ
He
took
out
RobbвЂ™s
letter
and
thrust
it
forward.
вЂњHere.
Read
itвЂ¦
Your
Grace.вЂќ

Lord
Balon
broke
the
seal
and
unfolded
the
parchment.
His
black
eyes
flicked
back
and
forth.
вЂњSo
the
boy
would
give
me
a
crown
again,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњand
all
I
need
do
is
destroy
his
enemies.вЂќ
His
thin
lips
twisted
in
a
smile.

вЂњBy
now
Robb
is
at
the
Golden
Tooth,вЂќ
Theon
said.
вЂњOnce
it
falls,
heвЂ™ll
be
through
the
hills
in
a
day.
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
host
is
at
Harrenhal,
cut
off
from
the
west.
The
Kingslayer
is
a
captive
at
Riverrun.
Only
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
and
the
raw
green
levies
heвЂ™s
been
gathering
remain
to
oppose
Robb
in
the
west.
Ser
Stafford
will
put
himself
between
RobbвЂ™s
army
and
Lannisport,
which
means
the
city
will
be
undefended
when
we
descend
on
it
by
sea.
If
the
gods
are
with
us,
even
Casterly
Rock
itself
may
fall
before
the
Lannisters
so
much
as
realize
that
we
are
upon
them.вЂќ

Lord
Balon
grunted.
вЂњCasterly
Rock
has
never
fallen.вЂќ

вЂњUntil
now.вЂќ
Theon
smiled.
And
how
sweet
that
will
be.

His
father
did
not
return
the
smile.
вЂњSo
this
is
why
Robb
Stark
sends
you
back
to
me,
after
so
long?
So
you
might
win
my
consent
to
this
plan
of
his?вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
my
plan,
not
RobbвЂ™s,вЂќ
Theon
said
proudly.
Mine,
as
the
victory
will
be
mine,
and
in
time
the
crown.
вЂњI
will
lead
the
attack
myself,
if
it
please
you.
As
my
reward
I
would
ask
that
you
grant
me
Casterly
Rock
for
my
own
seat,
once
we
have
taken
it
from
the
Lannisters.вЂќ
With
the
Rock,
he
could
hold
Lannisport
and
the
golden
lands
of
the
west.
It
would
mean
wealth
and
power
such
as
House
Greyjoy
had
never
known.

вЂњYou
reward
yourself
handsomely
for
a
notion
and
a
few
lines
of
scribbling.вЂќ
His
father
read
the
letter
again.
вЂњThe
pup
says
nothing
about
a
reward.
Only
that
you
speak
for
him,
and
I
am
to
listen,
and
give
him
my
sails
and
swords,
and
in
return
he
will
give
me
a
crown.вЂќ
His
flinty
eyes
lifted
to
meet
his
sonвЂ™s.
вЂњHe
will
give
me
a
crown,вЂќ
he
repeated,
his
voice
growing
sharp.

вЂњA
poor
choice
of
words,
what
is
meant
isвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhat
is
meant
is
what
is
said.
The
boy
will
give
me
a
crown.
And
what
is
given
can
be
taken
away.вЂќ
Lord
Balon
tossed
the
letter
onto
the
brazier,
atop
the
necklace.
The
parchment
curled,
blackened,
and
took
flame.

Theon
was
aghast.
вЂњHave
you
gone
mad?вЂќ

His
father
laid
a
stinging
backhand
across
his
cheek.
вЂњMind
your
tongue.
You
are
not
in
Winterfell
now,
and
I
am
not
Robb
the
Boy,
that
you
should
speak
to
me
so.
I
am
the
Greyjoy,
Lord
Reaper
of
Pyke,
King
of
Salt
and
Rock,
Son
of
the
Sea
Wind,
and
no
man
gives
me
a
crown.
I
pay
the
iron
price.
I
will
take
my
crown,
as
Urron
Redhand
did
five
thousand
years
ago.вЂќ

Theon
edged
backward,
away
from
the
sudden
fury
in
his
fatherвЂ™s
tone.
вЂњTake
it,
then,вЂќ
he
spat,
his
cheek
still
tingling.
вЂњCall
yourself
King
of
the
Iron
islands,
no
one
will
careвЂ¦
until
the
wars
are
over,
and
the
victor
looks
about
and
spies
the
old
fool
perched
off
his
shore
with
an
iron
crown
on
his
head.вЂќ

Lord
Balon
laughed.
вЂњWell,
at
the
least
you
are
no
craven.
No
more
than
IвЂ™m
a
fool.
Do
you
think
I
gather
my
ships
to
watch
them
rock
at
anchor?
I
mean
to
carve
out
a
kingdom
with
fire
and
swordвЂ¦
but
not
from
the
west,
and
not
at
the
bidding
of
King
Robb
the
Boy.
Casterly
Rock
is
too
strong,
and
Lord
Tywin
too
cunning
by
half.
Aye,
we
might
take
Lannisport,
but
we
should
never
keep
it.
No.
I
hunger
for
a
different
plumвЂ¦
not
so
juicy
sweet,
to
be
sure,
yet
it
hangs
there
ripe
and
undefended.вЂќ

Where?
Theon
might
have
asked,
but
by
then
he
knew.





DAENERYS

The
Dothraki
named
the
comet
shierak
qiya,
the
Bleeding
Star.
The
old
men
muttered
that
it
omened
ill,
but
Daenerys
Targaryen
had
seen
it
first
on
the
night
she
had
burned
Khal
Drogo,
the
night
her
dragons
had
awakened.
It
is
the
herald
of
my
coming,
she
told
herself
as
she
gazed
up
into
the
night
sky
with
wonder
in
her
heart.
The
gods
have
sent
it
to
show
me
the
way.

Yet
when
she
put
the
thought
into
words,
her
handmaid
Doreah
quailed.
вЂњThat
way
lies
the
red
lands,
Khaleesi.
A
grim
place
and
terrible,
the
riders
say.вЂќ

вЂњThe
way
the
comet
points
is
the
way
we
must
go,вЂќ
Dany
insistedвЂ¦
though
in
truth,
it
was
the
only
way
open
to
her.

She
dare
not
turn
north
onto
the
vast
ocean
of
grass
they
called
the
Dothraki
sea.
The
first
khalasar
they
met
would
swallow
up
her
ragged
band,
slaying
the
warriors
and
slaving
the
rest.
The
lands
of
the
Lamb
Men
south
of
the
river
were
likewise
closed
to
them.
They
were
too
few
to
defend
themselves
even
against
that
unwarlike
folk,
and
the
Lhazareen
had
small
reason
to
love
them.
She
might
have
struck
downriver
for
the
ports
at
Meereen
and
Yunkai
and
Astapor,
but
Rakharo
warned
her
that
PonoвЂ™s
khalasar
had
ridden
that
way,
driving
thousands
of
captives
before
them
to
sell
in
the
flesh
marts
that
festered
like
open
sores
on
the
shores
of
SlaverвЂ™s
Bay.
вЂњWhy
should
I
fear
Pono?вЂќ
Dany
objected.
вЂњHe
was
DrogoвЂ™s
ko,
and
always
spoke
me
gently.вЂќ

вЂњKo
Pono
spoke
you
gently,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said.
вЂњKhal
Pono
will
kill
you.
He
was
the
first
to
abandon
Drogo.
Ten
thousand
warriors
went
with
him.
You
have
a
hundred.вЂќ

No,
Dany
thought.
I
have
four.
The
rest
are
women,
old
sick
men
and
boys
whose
hair
has
never
been
braided.
вЂњI
have
the
dragons,вЂќ
she
pointed
out.

вЂњHatchlings,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said.
вЂњOne
swipe
from
an
arakh
would
put
an
end
to
them,
though
Porto
is
more
like
to
seize
them
for
himself.
Your
dragon
eggs
were
more
precious
than
rubies.
A
living
dragon
is
beyond
price.
In
all
the
world,
there
are
only
three.
Every
man
who
sees
them
will
want
them,
my
queen.вЂќ

вЂњThey
are
mine,вЂќ
she
said
fiercely.
They
had
been
born
from
her
faith
and
her
need,
given
life
by
the
deaths
of
her
husband
and
unborn
son
and
the
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
Dany
had
walked
into
the
flames
as
they
came
forth,
and
they
had
drunk
milk
from
her
swollen
breasts.
вЂњNo
man
will
take
them
from
me
while
I
live.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
not
live
long
should
you
meet
Khal
Pono.
Nor
Khal
Jhaqo,
nor
any
of
the
others.
You
must
go
where
they
do
not.вЂќ

Dany
had
named
him
the
first
of
her
QueensguardвЂ¦
and
when
MormontвЂ™s
gruff
counsel
and
the
omens
agreed,
her
course
was
clear.
She
called
her
people
together
and
mounted
her
silver
mare.
Her
hair
had
burned
away
in
DrogoвЂ™s
pyre,
so
her
handmaids
garbed
her
in
the
skin
of
the
hrakkar
Drogo
had
slain,
the
white
lion
of
the
Dothraki
sea.
Its
fearsome
head
made
a
hood
to
cover
her
naked
scalp,
its
pelt
a
cloak
that
flowed
across
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back.
The
cream-colored
dragon
sunk
sharp
black
claws
into
the
lionвЂ™s
mane
and
coiled
its
tail
around
her
arm,
while
Ser
Jorah
took
his
accustomed
place
by
her
side.

вЂњWe
follow
the
comet,вЂќ
Dany
told
her
khalasar.
Once
it
was
said,
no
word
was
raised
against
it.
They
had
been
DrogoвЂ™s
people,
but
they
were
hers
now.
The
Unburnt,
they
called
her,
and
Mother
of
Dragons.
Her
word
was
their
law.

They
rode
by
night,
and
by
day
took
refuge
from
the
sun
beneath
their
tents.
Soon
enough
Dany
learned
the
truth
of
DoreahвЂ™s
words.
This
was
no
kindly
country.
They
left
a
trail
of
dead
and
dying
horses
behind
them
as
they
went,
for
Pono,
Jhaqo,
and
the
others
had
seized
the
best
of
DrogoвЂ™s
herds,
leaving
to
Dany
the
old
and
the
scrawny,
the
sickly
and
the
lame,
the
broken
animals
and
the
ill-tempered.
It
was
the
same
with
the
people.
They
are
not
strong,
she
told
herself,
so
I
must
be
their
strength.
I
must
show
no
fear,
no
weakness,
no
doubt.
However
frightened
my
heart,
when
they
look
upon
my
face
they
must
see
only
DrogoвЂ™s
queen.
She
felt
older
than
her
fourteen
years.
If
ever
she
had
truly
been
a
girl,
that
time
was
done.

Three
days
into
the
march,
the
first
man
died.
A
toothless
oldster
with
cloudy
blue
eyes,
he
fell
exhausted
from
his
saddle
and
could
not
rise
again.
An
hour
later
he
was
done.
Blood
flies
swarmed
about
his
corpse
and
carried
his
ill
luck
to
the
living.
вЂњHis
time
was
past,вЂќ
her
handmaid
Irri
declared.
вЂњNo
man
should
live
longer
than
his
teeth.вЂќ
The
others
agreed.
Dany
bid
them
kill
the
weakest
of
their
dying
horses,
so
the
dead
man
might
go
mounted
into
the
night
lands.

Two
nights
later,
it
was
an
infant
girl
who
perished.
Her
motherвЂ™s
anguished
wailing
lasted
all
day,
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done.
The
child
had
been
too
young
to
ride,
poor
thing.
Not
for
her
the
endless
black
grasses
of
the
night
lands;
she
must
be
born
again.

There
was
little
forage
in
the
red
waste,
and
less
water.
It
was
a
sere
and
desolate
land
of
low
hills
and
barren
windswept
plains.
The
rivers
they
crossed
were
dry
as
dead
menвЂ™s
bones.
Their
mounts
subsisted
on
the
tough
brown
devilgrass
that
grew
in
clumps
at
the
base
of
rocks
and
dead
trees.
Dany
sent
outriders
ranging
ahead
of
the
column,
but
they
found
neither
wells
nor
springs,
only
bitter
pools,
shallow
and
stagnant,
shrinking
in
the
hot
sun.
The
deeper
they
rode
into
the
waste,
the
smaller
the
pools
became,
while
the
distance
between
them
grew.
If
there
were
gods
in
this
trackless
wilderness
of
stone
and
sand
and
red
clay,
they
were
hard
dry
gods,
deaf
to
prayers
for
rain.

Wine
gave
out
first,
and
soon
thereafter
the
clotted
mareвЂ™s
milk
the
horselords
loved
better
than
mead.
Then
their
stores
of
flatbread
and
dried
meat
were
exhausted
as
well.
Their
hunters
found
no
game,
and
only
the
flesh
of
their
dead
horses
filled
their
bellies.
Death
followed
death.
Weak
children,
wrinkled
old
women,
the
sick
and
the
stupid
and
the
heedless,
the
cruel
land
claimed
them
all.
Doreah
grew
gaunt
and
hollow-eyed,
and
her
soft
golden
hair
turned
brittle
as
straw.

Dany
hungered
and
thirsted
with
the
rest
of
them.
The
milk
in
her
breasts
dried
up,
her
nipples
cracked
and
bled,
and
the
flesh
fell
away
from
her
day
by
day
until
she
was
lean
and
hard
as
a
stick,
yet
it
was
her
dragons
she
feared
for.
Her
father
had
been
slain
before
she
was
born,
and
her
splendid
brother
Rhaegar
as
well.
Her
mother
had
died
bringing
her
into
the
world
while
the
storm
screamed
outside.
Gentle
Ser
Willem
Darry,
who
must
have
loved
her
after
a
fashion,
had
been
taken
by
a
wasting
sickness
when
she
was
very
young.
Her
brother
Viserys,
Khal
Drogo
who
was
her
sun-and-stars,
even
her
unborn
son,
the
gods
had
claimed
them
all.
They
will
not
have
my
dragons,
Dany
vowed.
They
will
not.

The
dragons
were
no
larger
than
the
scrawny
cats
she
had
once
seen
skulking
along
the
walls
of
Magister
IllyrioвЂ™s
estate
in
PentosвЂ¦
until
they
unfolded
their
wings.
Their
span
was
three
times
their
length,
each
wing
a
delicate
fan
of
translucent
skin,
gorgeously
colored,
stretched
taut
between
long
thin
bones.
When
you
looked
hard,
you
could
see
that
most
of
their
body
was
neck,
tail,
and
wing.
Such
little
things,
she
thought
as
she
fed
them
by
hand.
or
rather,
tried
to
feed
them,
for
the
dragons
would
not
eat.
They
would
hiss
and
spit
at
each
bloody
morsel
of
horsemeat,
steam
rising
from
their
nostrils,
yet
they
would
not
take
the
foodвЂ¦
until
Dany
recalled
something
Viserys
had
told
her
when
they
were
children.

Only
dragons
and
men
eat
cooked
meat,
he
had
said.

When
she
had
her
handmaids
char
the
horsemeat
black,
the
dragons
ripped
at
it
eagerly,
their
heads
striking
like
snakes.
So
long
as
the
meat
was
seared,
they
gulped
down
several
times
their
own
weight
every
day,
and
at
last
began
to
grow
larger
and
stronger.
Dany
marveled
at
the
smoothness
of
their
scales,
and
the
heat
that
poured
off
them,
so
palpable
that
on
cold
nights
their
whole
bodies
seemed
to
steam.

Each
evenfall
as
the
khalasar
set
out,
she
would
choose
a
dragon
to
ride
upon
her
shoulder.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
carried
the
others
in
a
cage
of
woven
wood
slung
between
their
mounts,
and
rode
close
behind
her,
so
Dany
was
never
out
of
their
sight.
It
was
the
only
way
to
keep
them
quiescent.

вЂњAegonвЂ™s
dragons
were
named
for
the
gods
of
Old
Valyria,вЂќ
she
told
her
bloodriders
one
morning
after
a
long
nightвЂ™s
journey.
вЂњVisenyaвЂ™s
dragon
was
Vhagar,
Rhaenys
had
Meraxes,
and
Aegon
rode
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread.
It
was
said
that
VhagarвЂ™s
breath
was
so
hot
that
it
could
melt
a
knightвЂ™s
armor
and
cook
the
man
inside,
that
Meraxes
swallowed
horses
whole,
and
BalerionвЂ¦
his
fire
was
as
black
as
his
scales,
his
wings
so
vast
that
whole
towns
were
swallowed
up
in
their
shadow
when
he
passed
overhead.вЂќ

The
Dothraki
looked
at
her
hatchlings
uneasily.
The
largest
of
her
three
was
shiny
black,
his
scales
slashed
with
streaks
of
vivid
scarlet
to
match
his
wings
and
horns.
вЂњKhaleesi,вЂќ
Aggo
murmured,
вЂњthere
sits
Balerion,
come
again.вЂќ

вЂњIt
may
be
as
you
say,
blood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
Dany
replied
gravely,
вЂњbut
he
shall
have
a
new
name
for
this
new
life.
I
would
name
them
all
for
those
the
gods
have
taken.
The
green
one
shall
be
Rhaegal,
for
my
valiant
brother
who
died
on
the
green
banks
of
the
Trident.
The
cream-and-gold
I
call
Viserion.
Viserys
was
cruel
and
weak
and
frightened,
yet
he
was
my
brother
still.
His
dragon
will
do
what
he
could
not.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
black
beast?вЂќ
asked
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.

вЂњThe
black,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњis
Drogon.вЂќ

Yet
even
as
her
dragons
prospered,
her
khalasar
withered
and
died.
Around
them
the
land
turned
ever
more
desolate.
Even
devilgrass
grew
scant;
horses
dropped
in
their
tracks,
leaving
so
few
that
some
of
her
people
must
trudge
along
on
foot.
Doreah
took
a
fever
and
grew
worse
with
every
league
they
crossed.
Her
lips
and
hands
broke
with
blood
blisters,
her
hair
came
out
in
clumps,
and
one
evenfall
she
lacked
the
strength
to
mount
her
horse.
Jhogo
said
they
must
leave
her
or
bind
her
to
her
saddle,
but
Dany
remembered
a
night
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
when
the
Lysene
girl
had
taught
her
secrets
so
that
Drogo
might
love
her
more.
She
gave
Doreah
water
from
her
own
skin,
cooled
her
brow
with
a
damp
cloth,
and
held
her
hand
until
she
died,
shivering.
Only
then
would
she
permit
the
khalasar
to
press
on.

They
saw
no
sign
of
other
travelers.
The
Dothraki
began
to
mutter
fearfully
that
the
comet
had
led
them
to
some
hell.
Dany
went
to
Ser
Jorah
one
morning
as
they
made
camp
amidst
a
jumble
of
black
windscoured
stones.
вЂњAre
we
lost?вЂќ
she
asked
him.
вЂњDoes
this
waste
have
no
end
to
it?вЂќ

вЂњIt
has
an
end,вЂќ
he
answered
wearily.
вЂњI
have
seen
the
maps
the
traders
draw,
my
queen.
Few
caravans
come
this
way,
that
is
so,
yet
there
are
great
kingdoms
to
the
east,
and
cities
full
of
wonders.
Yi
Ti,
Qarth,
Asshai
by
the
ShadowвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWill
we
live
to
see
them?вЂќ

вЂњI
will
not
lie
to
you.
The
way
is
harder
than
I
dared
think.вЂќ
The
knightвЂ™s
face
was
grey
and
exhausted.
The
wound
he
had
taken
to
his
hip
the
night
he
fought
Khal
DrogoвЂ™s
bloodriders
had
never
fully
healed;
she
could
see
how
he
grimaced
when
he
mounted
his
horse,
and
he
seemed
to
slump
in
his
saddle
as
they
rode.
вЂњPerhaps
we
are
doomed
if
we
press
onвЂ¦
but
I
know
for
a
certainty
that
we
are
doomed
if
we
turn
back.вЂќ

Dany
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
cheek.
It
heartened
her
to
see
him
smile.
I
must
be
strong
for
him
as
well,
she
thought
grimly.
A
knight
he
may
be,
but
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.

The
next
pool
they
found
was
scalding
hot
and
stinking
of
brimstone,
but
their
skins
were
almost
empty.
The
Dothraki
cooled
the
water
in
jars
and
pots
and
drank
it
tepid.
The
taste
was
no
less
foul,
but
water
was
water,
and
all
of
them
thirsted.
Dany
looked
at
the
horizon
with
despair.
They
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number,
and
still
the
waste
stretched
before
them,
bleak
and
red
and
endless.
The
comet
mocks
my
hopes,
she
thought,
lifting
her
eyes
to
where
it
scored
the
sky.
Have
I
crossed
half
the
world
and
seen
the
birth
of
dragons
only
to
die
with
them
in
this
hard
hot
desert?
She
would
not
believe
it.

The
next
day,
dawn
broke
as
they
were
crossing
a
cracked
and
fissured
plain
of
hard
red
earth.
Dany
was
about
to
command
them
to
make
camp
when
her
outriders
came
racing
back
at
a
gallop.
вЂњA
city,
Khaleesi,вЂќ
they
cried.
вЂњA
city
pale
as
the
moon
and
lovely
as
a
maid.
An
hourвЂ™s
ride,
no
more.вЂќ

вЂњShow
me,вЂќ
she
said.

When
the
city
appeared
before
her,
its
walls
and
towers
shimmering
white
behind
a
veil
of
heat,
it
looked
so
beautiful
that
Dany
was
certain
it
must
be
a
mirage.
вЂњDo
you
know
what
place
this
might
be?
Ser
Jorah.вЂќ

The
exile
knight
gave
a
weary
shake
of
the
head.
вЂњNo,
my
queen.
I
have
never
traveled
this
far
east.вЂќ

The
distant
white
walls
promised
rest
and
safety,
a
chance
to
heal
and
grow
strong,
and
Dany
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
rush
toward
them.
Instead
she
turned
to
her
bloodriders.
вЂњBlood
of
my
blood,
go
ahead
of
us
and
learn
the
name
of
this
city,
and
what
manner
of
welcome
we
should
expect.вЂќ

вЂњAi,
Khaleesi,вЂќ
said
Aggo.

Her
riders
were
not
long
in
returning.
Rakharo
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
From
his
medallion
belt
hung
the
great
curving
arakh
that
Dany
had
bestowed
on
him
when
she
named
him
bloodrider.
вЂњThis
city
is
dead,
Khaleesi.
Nameless
and
godless
we
found
it,
the
gates
broken,
only
wind
and
flies
moving
through
the
streets.вЂќ

Jhiqui
shuddered.
вЂњWhen
the
gods
are
gone,
the
evil
ghosts
feast
by
night.
Such
places
are
best
shunned.
It
is
known.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
known,вЂќ
Irri
agreed.

вЂњNot
to
me.вЂќ
Dany
put
her
heels
into
her
horse
and
showed
them
the
way,
trotting
beneath
the
shattered
arch
of
an
ancient
gate
and
down
a
silent
street.
Ser
Jorah
and
her
bloodriders
followed,
and
then,
more
slowly,
the
rest
of
the
Dothraki.

How
long
the
city
had
been
deserted
she
could
not
know,
but
the
white
walls,
so
beautiful
from
afar,
were
cracked
and
crumbling
when
seen
up
close.
Inside
was
a
maze
of
narrow
crooked
alleys.
The
buildings
pressed
close,
their
facades
blank,
chalky,
windowless.
Everything
was
white,
as
if
the
people
who
lived
here
had
known
nothing
of
color.
They
rode
past
heaps
of
sun-washed
rubble
where
houses
had
fallen
in,
and
elsewhere
saw
the
faded
scars
of
fire.
At
a
place
where
six
alleys
came
together,
Dany
passed
an
empty
marble
plinth.
Dothraki
had
visited
this
place
before,
it
would
seem.
Perhaps
even
now
the
missing
statue
stood
among
the
other
stolen
gods
in
Vaes
Dothrak.
She
might
have
ridden
past
it
a
hundred
times,
never
knowing.
On
her
shoulder,
Viserion
hissed.

They
made
camp
before
the
remnants
of
a
gutted
palace,
on
a
windswept
plaza
where
devilgrass
grew
between
the
paving
stones.
Dany
sent
out
men
to
search
the
ruins.
Some
went
reluctantly,
yet
they
wentвЂ¦
and
one
scarred
old
man
returned
a
brief
time
later,
hopping
and
grinning,
his
hands
overflowing
with
figs.
They
were
small,
withered
things,
yet
her
people
grabbed
for
them
greedily,
jostling
and
pushing
at
each
other,
stuffing
the
fruit
into
their
cheeks
and
chewing
blissfully.

Other
searchers
returned
with
tales
of
other
fruit
trees,
hidden
behind
closed
doors
in
secret
gardens.
Aggo
showed
her
a
courtyard
overgrown
with
twisting
vines
and
tiny
green
grapes,
and
Jhogo
discovered
a
well
where
the
water
was
pure
and
cold.
Yet
they
found
bones
too,
the
skulls
of
the
unburied
dead,
bleached
and
broken.
вЂњGhosts,вЂќ
Irri
muttered.
вЂњTerrible
ghosts.
We
must
not
stay
here,
Khaleesi,
this
is
their
place.вЂќ

вЂњI
fear
no
ghosts.
Dragons
are
more
powerful
than
ghosts.вЂќ
And
figs
are
more
important.
вЂњGo
with
Jhiqui
and
find
me
some
clean
sand
for
a
bath,
and
trouble
me
no
more
with
silly
talk.вЂќ

In
the
coolness
of
her
tent,
Dany
blackened
horsemeat
over
a
brazier
and
reflected
on
her
choices.
There
was
food
and
water
here
to
sustain
them,
and
enough
grass
for
the
horses
to
regain
their
strength.
How
pleasant
it
would
be
to
wake
every
day
in
the
same
place,
to
linger
among
shady
gardens,
eat
figs,
and
drink
cool
water,
as
much
as
she
might
desire.

When
Irri
and
Jhiqui
returned
with
pots
of
white
sand,
Dany
stripped
and
let
them
scrub
her
clean.
вЂњYour
hair
is
coming
back,
Khaleesi,вЂќ
Jhiqui
said
as
she
scraped
sand
off
her
back.
Dany
ran
a
hand
over
the
top
of
her
head,
feeling
the
new
growth.
Dothraki
men
wore
their
hair
in
long
oiled
braids,
and
cut
them
only
when
defeated.
Perhaps
I
should
do
the
same,
she
thought,
to
remind
them
that
DrogoвЂ™s
strength
lives
within
me
now.
Khal
Drogo
had
died
with
his
hair
uncut,
a
boast
few
men
could
make.

Across
the
tent,
Rhaegal
unfolded
green
wings
to
flap
and
flutter
a
half
foot
before
thumping
to
the
carpet.
When
he
landed,
his
tail
lashed
back
and
forth
in
fury,
and
he
raised
his
head
and
screamed.
If
I
had
wings,
I
would
want
to
fly
too,
Dany
thought.
The
Targaryens
of
old
had
ridden
upon
dragonback
when
they
went
to
war.
She
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
feel
like,
to
straddle
a
dragonвЂ™s
neck
and
soar
high
into
the
air.
It
would
be
like
standing
on
a
mountaintop,
only
better.
The
whole
world
would
be
spread
out
below
If
I
flew
high
enough,
I
could
even
see
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
reach
up
and
touch
the
comet.

Irri
broke
her
reverie
to
tell
her
that
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
was
outside,
awaiting
her
pleasure.
вЂњSend
him
in,вЂќ
Dany
commanded,
sand-scrubbed
skin
tingling.
She
wrapped
herself
in
the
lionskin.
The
hrakkar
had
been
much
bigger
than
Dany,
so
the
pelt
covered
everything
that
wanted
covering.

вЂњIвЂ™ve
brought
you
a
peach,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said,
kneeling.
It
was
so
small
she
could
almost
hide
it
in
her
palm,
and
overripe
too,
but
when
she
took
the
first
bite,
the
flesh
was
so
sweet
she
almost
cried.
She
ate
it
slowly,
savoring
every
mouthful,
while
Ser
Jorah
told
her
of
the
tree
it
had
been
plucked
from,
in
a
garden
near
the
western
wall.

вЂњFruit
and
water
and
shade,вЂќ
Dany
said,
her
cheeks
sticky
with
peach
juice.
вЂњThe
gods
were
good
to
bring
us
to
this
place.вЂќ

вЂњWe
should
rest
here
until
we
are
stronger,вЂќ
the
knight
urged.
вЂњThe
red
lands
are
not
kind
to
the
weak.вЂќ

вЂњMy
handmaids
say
there
are
ghosts
here.вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
ghosts
everywhere,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said
softly.
вЂњWe
carry
them
with
us
wherever
we
go.вЂќ

Yes,
she
thought.
Viserys,
Khal
Drogo,
my
son
Rhaego,
they
are
with
me
always.
вЂњTell
me
the
name
of
your
ghost,
Jorah.
You
know
all
of
mine.вЂќ

His
face
grew
very
still.
вЂњHer
name
was
Lynesse.вЂќ

вЂњYour
wife?вЂќ

вЂњMy
second
wife.вЂќ

It
pains
him
to
speak
of
her,
Dany
saw,
but
she
wanted
to
know
the
truth.
вЂњIs
that
all
you
would
say
of
her?вЂќ
The
lion
pelt
slid
off
one
shoulder
and
she
tugged
it
back
into
place.
вЂњWas
she
beautiful?вЂќ

вЂњVery
beautiful.вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
lifted
his
eyes
from
her
shoulder
to
her
face.
вЂњThe
first
time
I
beheld
her,
I
thought
she
was
a
goddess
come
to
earth,
the
Maid
herself
made
flesh.
Her
birth
was
far
above
my
own.
She
was
the
youngest
daughter
of
Lord
Leyton
Hightower
of
Oldtown.
The
White
Bull
who
commanded
your
fatherвЂ™s
Kingsguard
was
her
great-uncle.
The
Hightowers
are
an
ancient
family,
very
rich
and
very
proud.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
loyal,вЂќ
Dany
said.
вЂњI
remember,
Viserys
said
the
Hightowers
were
among
those
who
stayed
true
to
my
father.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
so,вЂќ
he
admitted.

вЂњDid
your
fathers
make
the
match?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњOur
marriageвЂ¦
that
makes
a
long
tale
and
a
dull
one,
Your
Grace.
I
would
not
trouble
you
with
it.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
nowhere
to
go,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњPlease.вЂќ

вЂњAs
my
queen
commands.вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
frowned.
вЂњMy
homeвЂ¦
you
must
understand
that
to
understand
the
rest.
Bear
Island
is
beautiful,
but
remote.
Imagine
old
gnarled
oaks
and
tall
pines,
flowering
thornbushes,
grey
stones
bearded
with
moss,
little
creeks
running
icy
down
steep
hillsides.
The
hall
of
the
Mormonts
is
built
of
huge
logs
and
surrounded
by
an
earthen
palisade.
Aside
from
a
few
crofters,
my
people
live
along
the
coasts
and
fish
the
seas.
The
island
lies
far
to
the
north,
and
our
winters
are
more
terrible
than
you
can
imagine,
Khaleesi.

вЂњStill,
the
island
suited
me
well
enough,
and
I
never
lacked
for
women.
I
had
my
share
of
fishwives
and
crofterвЂ™s
daughters,
before
and
after
I
was
wed.
I
married
young,
to
a
bride
of
my
fatherвЂ™s
choosing,
a
Glover
of
Deepwood
Motte.
Ten
years
we
were
wed,
or
near
enough
as
makes
no
matter.
She
was
a
plain-faced
woman,
but
not
unkind.
I
suppose
I
came
to
love
her
after
a
fashion,
though
our
relations
were
dutiful
rather
than
passionate.
Three
times
she
miscarried
while
trying
to
give
me
an
heir.
The
last
time
she
never
recovered.
She
died
not
long
after.вЂќ

Dany
put
her
hand
on
his
and
gave
his
fingers
a
squeeze.
вЂњI
am
sorry
for
you,
truly.вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
nodded.
вЂњBy
then
my
father
had
taken
the
black,
so
I
was
Lord
of
Bear
Island
in
my
own
right.
I
had
no
lack
of
marriage
offers,
but
before
I
could
reach
a
decision
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
Usurper,
and
Ned
Stark
called
his
banners
to
help
his
friend
Robert.
The
final
battle
was
on
Pyke.
When
RobertвЂ™s
stonethrowers
opened
a
breach
in
King
BalonвЂ™s
wall,
a
priest
from
Myr
was
the
first
man
through,
but
I
was
not
far
behind.
For
that
I
won
my
knighthood.

вЂњTo
celebrate
his
victory,
Robert
ordained
that
a
tourney
should
be
held
outside
Lannisport.
It
was
there
I
saw
Lynesse,
a
maid
half
my
age.
She
had
come
up
from
Oldtown
with
her
father
to
see
her
brothers
joust.
I
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
her.
In
a
fit
of
madness,
I
begged
her
favor
to
wear
in
the
tourney,
never
dreaming
she
would
grant
my
request,
yet
she
did.

вЂњI
fight
as
well
as
any
man,
Khaleesi,
but
I
have
never
been
a
tourney
knight.
Yet
with
LynesseвЂ™s
favor
knotted
round
my
arm,
I
was
a
different
man.
I
won
joust
after
joust.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
fell
before
me,
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce.
Ser
Ryman
Frey,
his
brother
Ser
Hosteen,
Lord
Whent,
Strongboar,
even
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard,
I
unhorsed
them
all.
In
the
last
match,
I
broke
nine
lances
against
Jaime
Lannister
to
no
result,
and
King
Robert
gave
me
the
championвЂ™s
laurel.
I
crowned
Lynesse
queen
of
love
and
beauty,
and
that
very
night
went
to
her
father
and
asked
for
her
hand.
I
was
drunk,
as
much
on
glory
as
on
wine.
By
rights
I
should
have
gotten
a
contemptuous
refusal,
but
Lord
Leyton
accepted
my
offer.
We
were
married
there
in
Lannisport,
and
for
a
fortnight
I
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
wide
world.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
a
fortnight?вЂќ
asked
Dany.
Even
I
was
given
more
happiness
than
that,
with
Drogo
who
was
my
sun-and-stars.

вЂњA
fortnight
was
how
long
it
took
us
to
sail
from
Lannisport
back
to
Bear
Island.
My
home
was
a
great
disappointment
to
Lynesse.
It
was
too
cold,
too
damp,
too
far
away,
my
castle
no
more
than
a
wooden
longhall.
We
had
no
masques,
no
mummer
shows,
no
balls
or
fairs.
Seasons
might
pass
without
a
singer
ever
coming
to
play
for
us,
and
thereвЂ™s
not
a
goldsmith
on
the
island.
Even
meals
became
a
trial.
My
cook
knew
little
beyond
his
roasts
and
stews,
and
Lynesse
soon
lost
her
taste
for
fish
and
venison.

вЂњI
lived
for
her
smiles,
so
I
sent
all
the
way
to
Oldtown
for
a
new
cook,
and
brought
a
harper
from
Lannisport.
Goldsmiths,
jewelers,
dressmakers,
whatever
she
wanted
I
found
for
her,
but
it
was
never
enough.
Bear
Island
is
rich
in
bears
and
trees,
and
poor
in
aught
else.
I
built
a
fine
ship
for
her
and
we
sailed
to
Lannisport
and
Oldtown
for
festivals
and
fairs,
and
once
even
to
Braavos,
where
I
borrowed
heavily
from
the
money-lenders.
It
was
as
a
tourney
champion
that
I
had
won
her
hand
and
heart,
so
I
entered
other
tourneys
for
her
sake,
but
the
magic
was
gone.
I
never
distinguished
myself
again,
and
each
defeat
meant
the
loss
of
another
charger
and
another
suit
of
jousting
armor,
which
must
needs
be
ransomed
or
replaced.
The
cost
could
not
be
borne.
Finally
I
insisted
we
return
home,
but
there
matters
soon
grew
even
worse
than
before.
I
could
no
longer
pay
the
cook
and
the
harper,
and
Lynesse
grew
wild
when
I
spoke
of
pawning
her
jewels.

вЂњThe
restвЂ¦
I
did
things
it
shames
me
to
speak
of.
For
gold.
So
Lynesse
might
keep
her
jewels,
her
harper,
and
her
cook.
In
the
end
it
cost
me
all.
When
I
heard
that
Eddard
Stark
was
coming
to
Bear
Island,
I
was
so
lost
to
honor
that
rather
than
stay
and
face
his
judgment,
I
took
her
with
me
into
exile.
Nothing
mattered
but
our
love,
I
told
myself.
We
fled
to
Lys,
where
I
sold
my
ship
for
gold
to
keep
us.вЂќ

His
voice
was
thick
with
grief,
and
Dany
was
reluctant
to
press
him
any
further,
yet
she
had
to
know
how
it
ended.
вЂњDid
she
die
there?вЂќ
she
asked
him
gently.

вЂњOnly
to
me,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњIn
half
a
year
my
gold
was
gone,
and
I
was
obliged
to
take
service
as
a
sellsword.
While
I
was
fighting
Braavosi
on
the
Rhoyne,
Lynesse
moved
into
the
manse
of
a
merchant
prince
named
Tregar
Ormollen.
They
say
she
is
his
chief
concubine
now,
and
even
his
wife
goes
in
fear
of
her.вЂќ

Dany
was
horrified.
вЂњDo
you
hate
her?вЂќ

вЂњAlmost
as
much
as
I
love
her,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
answered.
вЂњPray
excuse
me,
my
queen.
I
find
I
am
very
tired.вЂќ

She
gave
him
leave
to
go,
but
as
he
was
lifting
the
flap
of
her
tent,
she
could
not
stop
herself
calling
after
him
with
one
last
question.
вЂњWhat
did
she
look
like,
your
Lady
Lynesse?вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
smiled
sadly.
вЂњWhy,
she
looked
a
bit
like
you,
Daenerys.вЂќ
He
bowed
low.
вЂњSleep
well,
my
queen.вЂќ

Dany
shivered,
and
pulled
the
lionskin
tight
about
her.
She
looked
like
me.
It
explained
much
that
she
had
not
truly
understood.
He
wants
me,
she
realized.
He
loves
me
as
he
loved
her,
not
as
a
knight
loves
his
queen
but
as
a
man
loves
a
woman.
She
tried
to
imagine
herself
in
Ser
JorahвЂ™s
arms,
kissing
him,
pleasuring
him,
letting
him
enter
her.
It
was
no
good.
When
she
closed
her
eyes,
his
face
kept
changing
into
DrogoвЂ™s.

Khal
Drogo
had
been
her
sun-and-stars,
her
first,
and
perhaps
he
must
be
her
last.
The
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
sworn
she
should
never
bear
a
living
child,
and
what
man
would
want
a
barren
wife?
And
what
man
could
hope
to
rival
Drogo,
who
had
died
with
his
hair
uncut
and
rode
now
through
the
night
lands,
the
stars
his
khalasar?

She
had
heard
the
longing
in
Ser
JorahвЂ™s
voice
when
he
spoke
of
his
Bear
Island.
He
can
never
have
me,
but
one
day
I
can
give
him
back
his
home
and
honor.
That
much
I
can
do
for
him.

No
ghosts
troubled
her
sleep
that
night.
She
dreamed
of
Drogo
and
the
first
ride
they
had
taken
together
on
the
night
they
were
wed.
In
the
dream
it
was
not
horses
they
rode,
but
dragons.

The
next
morn,
she
summoned
her
bloodriders.
вЂњBlood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
she
told
the
three
of
them,
вЂњI
have
need
of
you.
Each
of
you
is
to
choose
three
horses,
the
hardiest
and
healthiest
that
remain
to
us.
Load
as
much
water
and
food
as
your
mounts
can
bear,
and
ride
forth
for
me.
Aggo
shall
strike
southwest,
Rakharo
due
south.
Jhogo,
you
are
to
follow
shierak
qiya
on
southeast.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
shall
we
seek,
Khaleesi?вЂќ
asked
Jhogo.

вЂњWhatever
there
is,вЂќ
Dany
answered.
вЂњSeek
for
other
cities,
living
and
dead.
Seek
for
caravans
and
people.
Seek
for
rivers
and
lakes
and
the
great
salt
sea.
Find
how
far
this
waste
extends
before
us,
and
what
lies
on
the
other
side.
When
I
leave
this
place,
I
do
not
mean
to
strike
out
blind
again.
I
will
know
where
I
am
bound,
and
how
best
to
get
there.вЂќ

And
so
they
went,
the
bells
in
their
hair
ringing
softly,
while
Dany
settled
down
with
her
small
band
of
survivors
in
the
place
they
named
Vaes
Tolorro,
the
city
of
bones.
Day
followed
night
followed
day.
Women
harvested
fruit
from
the
gardens
of
the
dead.
Men
groomed
their
mounts
and
mended
saddles,
stirrups,
and
shoes.
Children
wandered
the
twisty
alleys
and
found
old
bronze
coins
and
bits
of
purple
glass
and
stone
flagons
with
handles
carved
like
snakes.
One
woman
was
stung
by
a
red
scorpion,
but
hers
was
the
only
death.
The
horses
began
to
put
on
some
flesh.
Dany
tended
Ser
JorahвЂ™s
wound
herself,
and
it
began
to
heal.

Rakharo
was
the
first
to
return.
Due
south
the
red
waste
stretched
on
and
on,
he
reported,
until
it
ended
on
a
bleak
shore
beside
the
poison
water.
Between
here
and
there
lay
only
swirling
sand,
wind-scoured
rocks,
and
plants
bristly
with
sharp
thorns.
He
had
passed
the
bones
of
a
dragon,
he
swore,
so
immense
that
he
had
ridden
his
horse
through
its
great
black
jaws.
Other
than
that,
he
had
seen
nothing.

Dany
gave
him
charge
of
a
dozen
of
her
strongest
men,
and
set
them
to
pulling
up
the
plaza
to
get
to
the
earth
beneath.
If
devilgrass
could
grow
between
the
paving
stones,
other
grasses
would
grow
when
the
stones
were
gone.
They
had
wells
enough,
no
lack
of
water.
Given
seed,
they
could
make
the
plaza
bloom.

Aggo
was
back
next.
The
southwest
was
barren
and
burnt,
he
swore.
He
had
found
the
ruins
of
two
more
cities,
smaller
than
Vaes
Tolorro
but
otherwise
the
same.
One
was
warded
by
a
ring
of
skulls
mounted
on
rusted
iron
spears,
so
he
dared
not
enter,
but
he
had
explored
the
second
for
as
long
as
he
could.
He
showed
Dany
an
iron
bracelet
he
had
found,
set
with
a
uncut
fire
opal
the
size
of
her
thumb.
There
were
scrolls
as
well,
but
they
were
dry
and
crumbling
and
Aggo
had
left
them
where
they
lay.

Dany
thanked
him
and
told
him
to
see
to
the
repair
of
the
gates.
If
enemies
had
crossed
the
waste
to
destroy
these
cities
in
ancient
days,
they
might
well
come
again.
вЂњIf
so,
we
must
be
ready,вЂќ
she
declared.

Jhogo
was
gone
so
long
that
Dany
feared
him
lost,
but
finally
when
they
had
all
but
ceased
to
look
for
him,
he
came
riding
up
from
the
southeast.
One
of
the
guards
that
Aggo
had
posted
saw
him
first
and
gave
a
shout,
and
Dany
rushed
to
the
walls
to
see
for
herself.
It
was
true.
Jhogo
came,
yet
not
alone.
Behind
him
rode
three
queerly
garbed
strangers
atop
ugly
humped
creatures
that
dwarfed
any
horse.

They
drew
rein
before
the
city
gates,
and
looked
up
to
see
Dany
on
the
wall
above
them.
вЂњBlood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
Jhogo
called,
вЂњI
have
been
to
the
great
city
Qarth,
and
returned
with
three
who
would
look
on
you
with
their
own
eyes.вЂќ

Dany
stared
down
at
the
strangers.
вЂњHere
I
stand.
Look,
if
that
is
your
pleasureвЂ¦
but
first
tell
me
your
names.вЂќ

The
pale
man
with
the
blue
lips
replied
in
guttural
Dothraki,
вЂњI
am
Pyat
Pree,
the
great
warlock.вЂќ

The
bald
man
with
the
jewels
in
his
nose
answered
in
the
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
вЂњI
am
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
of
the
Thirteen,
a
merchant
prince
of
Qarth.вЂќ

The
woman
in
the
lacquered
wooden
mask
said
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
вЂњI
am
Quaithe
of
the
Shadow.
We
come
seeking
dragons.вЂќ

вЂњSeek
no
more,вЂќ
Daenerys
Targaryen
told
them.
вЂњYou
have
found
them.вЂќ





JON

Whitetree,
the
village
was
named
on
SamвЂ™s
old
maps.
Jon
did
not
think
it
much
of
a
village.
Four
tumbledown
one-room
houses
of
unmortared
stone
surrounded
an
empty
sheepfold
and
a
well.
The
houses
were
roofed
with
sod,
the
windows
shuttered
with
ragged
pieces
of
hide.
And
above
them
loomed
the
pale
limbs
and
dark
red
leaves
of
a
monstrous
great
weirwood.

It
was
the
biggest
tree
Jon
Snow
had
ever
seen,
the
trunk
near
eight
feet
wide,
the
branches
spreading
so
far
that
the
entire
village
was
shaded
beneath
their
canopy.
The
size
did
not
disturb
him
so
much
as
the
faceвЂ¦
the
mouth
especially,
no
simple
carved
slash,
but
a
jagged
hollow
large
enough
to
swallow
a
sheep.

Those
are
not
sheep
bones,
though.
Nor
is
that
a
sheepвЂ™s
skull
in
the
ashes.

вЂњAn
old
tree.вЂќ
Mormont
sat
his
horse,
frowning.
вЂњOld,вЂќ
his
raven
agreed
from
his
shoulder.
вЂњOld,
old,
old.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
powerful.вЂќ
Jon
could
feel
the
power.

Thoren
Smallwood
dismounted
beside
the
trunk,
dark
in
his
plate
and
mail.
вЂњLook
at
that
face.
Small
wonder
men
feared
them,
when
they
first
came
to
Westeros.
IвЂ™d
like
to
take
an
axe
to
the
bloody
thing
myself.вЂќ

Jon
said,
вЂњMy
lord
father
believed
no
man
could
tell
a
lie
in
front
of
a
heart
tree.
The
old
gods
know
when
men
are
lying.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
believed
the
same,вЂќ
said
the
Old
Bear.
вЂњLet
me
have
a
look
at
that
skull.вЂќ

Jon
dismounted.
Slung
across
his
back
in
a
black
leather
shoulder
sheath
was
Longclaw,
the
hand-and-a-half
bastard
blade
the
Old
Bear
had
given
him
for
saving
his
life.
A
bastard
sword
for
a
bastard,
the
men
joked.
The
hilt
had
been
fashioned
new
for
him,
adorned
with
a
wolfвЂ™s-head
pommel
in
pale
stone,
but
the
blade
itself
was
Valyrian
steel,
old
and
light
and
deadly
sharp.

He
knelt
and
reached
a
gloved
hand
down
into
the
maw.
The
inside
of
the
hollow
was
red
with
dried
sap
and
blackened
by
fire.
Beneath
the
skull
he
saw
another,
smaller,
the
jaw
broken
off.
It
was
half-buried
in
ash
and
bits
of
bone.

When
he
brought
the
skull
to
Mormont,
the
Old
Bear
lifted
it
in
both
hands
and
stared
into
the
empty
sockets.
вЂњThe
wildlings
burn
their
dead.
WeвЂ™ve
always
known
that.
Now
I
wished
IвЂ™d
asked
them
why,
when
there
were
still
a
few
around
to
ask.вЂќ

Jon
Snow
remembered
the
wight
rising,
its
eyes
shining
blue
in
the
pale
dead
face.
He
knew
why,
he
was
certain.

вЂњWould
that
bones
could
talk,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
grumbled.
вЂњThis
fellow
could
tell
us
much.
How
he
died.
Who
burned
him,
and
why.
Where
the
wildlings
have
gone.вЂќ
He
sighed.
вЂњThe
children
of
the
forest
could
speak
to
the
dead,
itвЂ™s
said.
But
I
canвЂ™t.вЂќ
He
tossed
the
skull
back
into
the
mouth
of
the
tree,
where
it
landed
with
a
puff
of
fine
ash.
вЂњGo
through
all
these
houses.
Giant,
get
to
the
top
of
this
tree,
have
a
look.
IвЂ™ll
have
the
hounds
brought
up
too.
Perchance
this
time
the
trail
will
be
fresher.вЂќ
His
tone
did
not
suggest
that
he
held
out
much
hope
of
the
last.

Two
men
went
through
each
house,
to
make
certain
nothing
was
missed.
Jon
was
paired
with
dour
Eddison
Tollett,
a
squire
grey
of
hair
and
thin
as
a
pike,
whom
the
other
brothers
called
Dolorous
Edd.
вЂњBad
enough
when
the
dead
come
walking,вЂќ
he
said
to
Jon
as
they
crossed
the
village,
вЂњnow
the
Old
Bear
wants
them
talking
as
well?
No
good
will
come
of
that,
IвЂ™ll
warrant.
And
whoвЂ™s
to
say
the
bones
wouldnвЂ™t
lie?
Why
should
death
make
a
man
truthful,
or
even
clever?
The
dead
are
likely
dull
fellows,
full
of
tedious
complaintsвЂ”the
groundвЂ™s
too
cold,
my
gravestone
should
be
larger,
why
does
he
get
more
worms
than
I
doвЂ¦вЂќ

Jon
had
to
stoop
to
pass
through
the
low
door.
Within
he
found
a
packed
dirt
floor.
There
were
no
furnishings,
no
sign
that
people
had
lived
here
but
for
some
ashes
beneath
the
smoke
hole
in
the
roof.
вЂњWhat
a
dismal
place
to
live,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњI
was
born
in
a
house
much
like
this,вЂќ
declared
Dolorous
Edd.
вЂњThose
were
my
enchanted
years.
Later
I
fell
on
hard
times.вЂќ
A
nest
of
dry
straw
bedding
filled
one
corner
of
the
room.
Edd
looked
at
it
with
longing.
вЂњIвЂ™d
give
all
the
gold
in
Casterly
Rock
to
sleep
in
a
bed
again.вЂќ

вЂњYou
call
that
a
bed?вЂќ

вЂњIf
itвЂ™s
softer
than
the
ground
and
has
a
roof
over
it,
I
call
it
a
bed.вЂќ
Dolorous
Edd
sniffed
the
air.
вЂњI
smell
dung.вЂќ

The
smell
was
very
faint.
вЂњOld
dung,вЂќ
said
Jon.
The
house
felt
as
though
it
had
been
empty
for
some
time.
Kneeling,
he
searched
through
the
straw
with
his
hands
to
see
if
anything
had
been
concealed
beneath,
then
made
a
round
of
the
walls.
It
did
not
take
very
long.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
nothing
here.вЂќ

Nothing
was
what
he
had
expected;
Whitetree
was
the
fourth
village
they
had
passed,
and
it
had
been
the
same
in
all
of
them.
The
people
were
gone,
vanished
with
their
scant
possessions
and
whatever
animals
they
may
have
had.
None
of
the
villages
showed
any
signs
of
having
been
attacked.
They
were
simplyвЂ¦
empty.
вЂњWhat
do
you
think
happened
to
them
all?вЂќ
Jon
asked.

вЂњSomething
worse
than
we
can
imagine,вЂќ
suggested
Dolorous
Edd.
вЂњWell,
I
might
be
able
to
imagine
it,
but
IвЂ™d
sooner
not.
Bad
enough
to
know
youвЂ™re
going
to
come
to
some
awful
end
without
thinking
about
it
aforetime.вЂќ

Two
of
the
hounds
were
sniffing
around
the
door
as
they
reemerged.
Other
dogs
ranged
through
the
village.
Chett
was
cursing
them
loudly,
his
voice
thick
with
the
anger
he
never
seemed
to
put
aside.
The
light
filtering
through
the
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
made
the
boils
on
his
face
look
even
more
inflamed
than
usual.
When
he
saw
Jon
his
eyes
narrowed;
there
was
no
love
lost
between
them.

The
other
houses
had
yielded
no
wisdom.
вЂњGone,вЂќ
cried
MormontвЂ™s
raven,
flapping
up
into
the
weirwood
to
perch
above
them.
вЂњGone,
gone,
gone.вЂќ

вЂњThere
were
wildlings
at
Whitetree
only
a
year
ago.вЂќ
Thoren
Smallwood
looked
more
a
lord
than
Mormont
did,
clad
in
Ser
Jaremy
RykkerвЂ™s
gleaming
black
mail
and
embossed
breastplate.
His
heavy
cloak
was
richly
trimmed
with
sable,
and
clasped
with
the
crossed
hammers
of
the
Rykkers,
wrought
in
silver.
Ser
JaremyвЂ™s
cloak,
onceвЂ¦
but
the
wight
had
claimed
Ser
Jaremy,
and
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
wasted
nothing.

вЂњA
year
ago
Robert
was
king,
and
the
realm
was
at
peace,вЂќ
declared
Jarman
Buckwell,
the
square
stolid
man
who
commanded
the
scouts.
вЂњMuch
can
change
in
a
yearвЂ™s
time.вЂќ

вЂњOne
thing
hasnвЂ™t
changed,вЂќ
Ser
Mallador
Locke
insisted.
вЂњFewer
wildlings
means
fewer
worries.
I
wonвЂ™t
mourn,
whateverвЂ™s
become
of
them.
Raiders
and
murderers,
the
lot
of
them.вЂќ

Jon
heard
a
rustling
from
the
red
leaves
above.
Two
branches
parted,
and
he
glimpsed
a
little
man
moving
from
limb
to
limb
as
easily
as
a
squirrel.
Bedwyck
stood
no
more
than
five
feet
tall,
but
the
grey
streaks
in
his
hair
showed
his
age.
The
other
rangers
called
him
Giant.
He
sat
in
a
fork
of
the
tree
over
their
heads
and
said,
вЂњThereвЂ™s
water
to
the
north.
A
lake,
might
be.
A
few
flint
hills
rising
to
the
west,
not
very
high.
Nothing
else
to
see,
my
lords.вЂќ

вЂњWe
might
camp
here
tonight,вЂќ
Smallwood
suggested.

The
Old
Bear
glanced
up,
searching
for
a
glimpse
of
sky
through
the
pale
limbs
and
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood.
вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
declared.
вЂњGiant,
how
much
daylight
remains
to
us?вЂќ

вЂњThree
hours,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
press
on
north,вЂќ
Mormont
decided.
вЂњIf
we
reach
this
lake,
we
can
make
camp
by
the
shore,
perchance
catch
a
few
fish.
Jon,
fetch
me
paper,
itвЂ™s
past
time
I
wrote
Maester
Aemon.вЂќ

Jon
found
parchment,
quill,
and
ink
in
his
saddlebag
and
brought
them
to
the
Lord
Commander.
At
Whitetree,
Mormont
scrawled.
The
fourth
village.
All
empty.
The
wildlings
are
gone.
вЂњFind
Tarly
and
see
that
he
gets
this
on
its
way,вЂќ
he
said
as
he
handed
Jon
the
message.
When
he
whistled,
his
raven
came
flapping
down
to
land
on
his
horseвЂ™s
head.
вЂњCorn,вЂќ
the
raven
suggested,
bobbing.
The
horse
whickered.

Jon
mounted
his
garron,
wheeled
him
about,
and
trotted
off.
Beyond
the
shade
of
the
great
weirwood
the
men
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
stood
beneath
lesser
trees,
tending
their
horses,
chewing
strips
of
salt
beef,
pissing,
scratching,
and
talking.
When
the
command
was
given
to
move
out
again,
the
talk
died,
and
they
climbed
back
into
their
saddles.
Jarman
BuckwellвЂ™s
scouts
rode
out
first,
with
the
vanguard
under
Thoren
Smallwood
heading
the
column
proper.
Then
came
the
Old
Bear
with
the
main
force,
Ser
Mallador
Locke
with
the
baggage
train
and
packhorses,
and
finally
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
and
the
rear
guard.
Two
hundred
men
all
told,
with
half
again
as
many
mounts.

By
day
they
followed
game
trails
and
streambeds,
the
вЂњrangerвЂ™s
roadsвЂќ
that
led
them
ever
deeper
into
the
wilderness
of
leaf
and
root.
At
night
they
camped
beneath
a
starry
sky
and
gazed
up
at
the
comet.
The
black
brothers
had
left
Castle
Black
in
good
spirits,
joking
and
trading
tales,
but
of
late
the
brooding
silence
of
the
wood
seemed
to
have
sombered
them
all.
Jests
had
grown
fewer
and
tempers
shorter.
No
one
would
admit
to
being
afraidвЂ”they
were
men
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch,
after
allвЂ”but
Jon
could
feel
the
unease.
Four
empty
villages,
no
wildlings
anywhere,
even
the
game
seemingly
fled.
The
haunted
forest
had
never
seemed
more
haunted,
even
veteran
rangers
agreed.

As
he
rode,
Jon
peeled
off
his
glove
to
air
his
burned
fingers.
Ugly
things.
He
remembered
suddenly
how
he
used
to
muss
AryaвЂ™s
hair.
His
little
stick
of
a
sister.
He
wondered
how
she
was
faring.
It
made
him
a
little
sad
to
think
that
he
might
never
muss
her
hair
again.
He
began
to
flex
his
hand,
opening
and
closing
the
fingers.
If
he
let
his
sword
hand
stiffen
and
grow
clumsy,
it
well
might
be
the
end
of
him,
he
knew.
A
man
needed
his
sword
beyond
the
Wall.

Jon
found
Samwell
Tarly
with
the
other
stewards,
watering
his
horses.
He
had
three
to
tend:
his
own
mount,
and
two
packhorses,
each
bearing
a
large
wire-and-wicker
cage
full
of
ravens.
The
birds
flapped
their
wings
at
JonвЂ™s
approach
and
screamed
at
him
through
the
bars.
A
few
shrieks
sounded
suspiciously
like
words.
вЂњHave
you
been
teaching
them
to
talk?вЂќ
he
asked
Sam.

вЂњA
few
words.
Three
of
them
can
say
snow.вЂќ

вЂњOne
bird
croaking
my
name
was
bad
enough,вЂќ
said
Jon,
вЂњand
snowвЂ™s
nothing
a
black
brother
wants
to
hear
about.вЂќ
Snow
often
meant
death
in
the
north.

вЂњWas
there
anything
in
Whitetree?вЂќ

вЂњBones,
ashes,
and
empty
houses.вЂќ
Jon
handed
Sam
the
roll
of
parchment.
вЂњThe
Old
Bear
wants
word
sent
back
to
Aemon.вЂќ

Sam
took
a
bird
from
one
of
the
cages,
stroked
its
feathers,
attached
the
message,
and
said,
вЂњFly
home
now,
brave
one.
Home.вЂќ
The
raven
quorked
something
unintelligible
back
at
him,
and
Sam
tossed
it
into
the
air.
Flapping,
it
beat
its
way
skyward
through
the
trees.
вЂњI
wish
he
could
carry
me
with
him.вЂќ

вЂњStill?вЂќ

вЂњWell,вЂќ
said
Sam,
вЂњyes,
butвЂ¦
IвЂ™m
not
as
frightened
as
I
was,
truly.
The
first
night,
every
time
I
heard
someone
getting
up
to
make
water,
I
thought
it
was
wildlings
creeping
in
to
slit
my
throat.
I
was
afraid
that
if
I
closed
my
eyes,
I
might
never
open
them
again,
onlyвЂ¦
wellвЂ¦
dawn
came
after
all.вЂќ
He
managed
a
wan
smile.
вЂњI
may
be
craven,
but
IвЂ™m
not
stupid.
IвЂ™m
sore
and
my
back
aches
from
riding
and
from
sleeping
on
the
ground,
but
IвЂ™m
hardly
scared
at
all.
Look.вЂќ
He
held
out
a
hand
for
Jon
to
see
how
steady
it
was.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
been
working
on
my
maps.вЂќ

The
world
is
strange,
Jon
thought.
Two
hundred
brave
men
had
left
the
Wall,
and
the
only
one
who
was
not
growing
more
fearful
was
Sam,
the
self-confessed
coward.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
make
a
ranger
of
you
yet,вЂќ
he
joked.
вЂњNext
thing,
youвЂ™ll
want
to
be
an
outrider
like
Grenn.
Shall
I
speak
to
the
Old
Bear?вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
you
dare!вЂќ
Sam
pulled
up
the
hood
of
his
enormous
black
cloak
and
clambered
awkwardly
back
onto
his
horse.
It
was
a
plow
horse,
big
and
slow
and
clumsy,
but
better
able
to
bear
his
weight
than
the
little
garrons
the
rangers
rode.
вЂњI
had
hoped
we
might
stay
the
night
in
the
village,вЂќ
he
said
wistfully.
вЂњIt
would
be
nice
to
sleep
under
a
roof
again.вЂќ

вЂњToo
few
roofs
for
all
of
us.вЂќ
Jon
mounted
again,
gave
Sam
a
parting
smile,
and
rode
off.
The
column
was
well
under
way,
so
he
swung
wide
around
the
village
to
avoid
the
worst
of
the
congestion.
He
had
seen
enough
of
Whitetree.

Ghost
emerged
from
the
undergrowth
so
suddenly
that
the
garron
shied
and
reared.
The
white
wolf
hunted
well
away
from
the
line
of
march,
but
he
was
not
having
much
better
fortune
than
the
foragers
Smallwood
sent
out
after
game.
The
woods
were
as
empty
as
the
villages,
Dywen
had
told
him
one
night
around
the
fire.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
a
large
party,вЂќ
Jon
had
said.
вЂњThe
gameвЂ™s
probably
been
frightened
away
by
all
the
noise
we
make
on
the
march.вЂќ

вЂњFrightened
away
by
something,
no
doubt,вЂќ
Dywen
said.

Once
the
horse
had
settled,
Ghost
loped
along
easily
beside
him.
Jon
caught
up
to
Mormont
as
he
was
wending
his
way
around
a
hawthorn
thicket.
вЂњIs
the
bird
away?вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
asked.

вЂњYes,
my
lord.
Sam
is
teaching
them
to
talk.вЂќ

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
regret
that.
Damned
things
make
a
lot
of
noise,
but
they
never
say
a
thing
worth
hearing.вЂќ

They
rode
in
silence,
until
Jon
said,
вЂњIf
my
uncle
found
all
these
villages
empty
as
wellвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”he
would
have
made
it
his
purpose
to
learn
why,вЂќ
Lord
Mormont
finished
for
him,
вЂњand
it
may
well
be
someone
or
something
did
not
want
that
known.
Well,
weвЂ™ll
be
three
hundred
when
Qhorin
joins
us.
Whatever
enemy
waits
out
here
will
not
find
us
so
easy
to
deal
with.
We
will
find
them,
Jon,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

Or
they
will
find
us,
thought
Jon.





ARYA

The
river
was
a
blue-green
ribbon
shining
in
the
morning
sun.
Reeds
grew
thick
in
the
shallows
along
the
banks,
and
Arya
saw
a
water
snake
skimming
across
the
surface,
ripples
spreading
out
behind
it
as
it
went.
Overhead
a
hawk
flew
in
lazy
circles.

It
seemed
a
peaceful
placeвЂ¦
until
Koss
spotted
the
dead
man.
вЂњThere,
in
the
reeds.вЂќ
He
pointed,
and
Arya
saw
it.
The
body
of
a
soldier,
shapeless
and
swollen.
His
sodden
green
cloak
had
hung
up
on
a
rotted
log,
and
a
school
of
tiny
silver
fishes
were
nibbling
at
his
face.
вЂњI
told
you
there
was
bodies,вЂќ
Lommy
announced.
вЂњI
could
taste
them
in
that
water.вЂќ

When
Yoren
saw
the
corpse,
he
spat.
вЂњDobber,
see
if
heвЂ™s
got
anything
worth
the
taking.
Mail,
knife,
a
bit
oвЂ™
coin,
what
have
you.вЂќ
He
spurred
his
gelding
and
rode
out
into
the
river,
but
the
horse
struggled
in
the
soft
mud
and
beyond
the
reeds
the
water
deepened.
Yoren
rode
back
angry,
his
horse
covered
in
brown
slime
up
to
the
knees.
вЂњWe
wonвЂ™t
be
crossing
here.
Koss,
youвЂ™ll
come
with
me
upriver,
look
for
a
ford.
Woth,
Gerren,
you
go
downstream.
The
rest
oвЂ™
you
wait
here.
Put
a
guard
out.вЂќ

Dobber
found
a
leather
purse
in
the
dead
manвЂ™s
belt.
Inside
were
four
coppers
and
a
little
hank
of
blond
hair
tied
up
with
a
red
ribbon.
Lommy
and
Tarber
stripped
naked
and
went
wading,
and
Lommy
scooped
up
handfuls
of
slimy
mud
and
threw
them
at
Hot
Pie,
shouting,
вЂњMud
Pie!
Mud
Pie!вЂќ
In
the
back
of
their
wagon,
Rorge
cursed
and
threatened
and
told
them
to
unchain
him
while
Yoren
was
gone,
but
no
one
paid
him
any
mind.
Kurz
caught
a
fish
with
his
bare
hands.
Arya
saw
how
he
did
it,
standing
over
a
shallow
pool,
calm
as
still
water,
his
hand
darting
out
quick
as
a
snake
when
the
fish
swam
near.
It
didnвЂ™t
look
as
hard
as
catching
cats.
Fish
didnвЂ™t
have
claws.

It
was
midday
when
the
others
returned.
Woth
reported
a
wooden
bridge
half
a
mile
downstream,
but
someone
had
burned
it
up.
Yoren
peeled
a
sourleaf
off
the
bale.
вЂњMight
be
we
could
swim
the
horses
over,
maybe
the
donkeys,
but
thereвЂ™s
no
way
weвЂ™ll
get
those
wagons
across.
And
thereвЂ™s
smoke
to
the
north
and
west,
more
fires,
could
be
this
side
oвЂ™
the
riverвЂ™s
the
place
we
want
to
be.вЂќ
He
picked
up
a
long
stick
and
drew
a
circle
in
the
mud,
a
line
trailing
down
from
it.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
Gods
Eye,
with
the
river
flowing
south.
WeвЂ™re
here.вЂќ
He
poked
a
hole
beside
the
line
of
the
river,
under
the
circle.
вЂњWe
canвЂ™t
go
round
west
of
the
lake,
like
I
thought.
East
takes
us
back
to
the
kingsroad.вЂќ
He
moved
the
stick
up
to
where
the
line
and
circle
met.
вЂњNear
as
I
recall,
thereвЂ™s
a
town
here.
The
holdfastвЂ™s
stone,
and
thereвЂ™s
a
lordling
got
his
seat
there
too,
just
a
towerhouse,
but
heвЂ™ll
have
a
guard,
might
be
a
knight
or
two.
We
follow
the
river
north,
should
be
there
before
dark.
TheyвЂ™ll
have
boats,
so
I
mean
to
sell
all
we
got
and
hire
us
one.вЂќ
He
drew
the
stick
up
through
the
circle
of
the
lake,
from
bottom
to
top.
вЂњGods
be
good,
weвЂ™ll
find
a
wind
and
sail
across
the
Gods
Eye
to
Harrentown.вЂќ
He
thrust
the
point
down
at
the
top
of
the
circle.
вЂњWe
can
buy
new
mounts
there,
or
else
take
shelter
at
Harrenhal.
ThatвЂ™s
Lady
WhentвЂ™s
seat,
and
sheвЂ™s
always
been
a
friend
oвЂ™
the
Watch.вЂќ

Hot
PieвЂ™s
eyes
got
wide.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
ghosts
in
HarrenhalвЂ¦вЂќ

Yoren
spat.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
for
your
ghosts.вЂќ
He
tossed
the
stick
down
in
the
mud.
вЂњMount
up.вЂќ

Arya
was
remembering
the
stories
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
of
Harrenhal.
Evil
King
Harren
had
walled
himself
up
inside,
so
Aegon
unleashed
his
dragons
and
turned
the
castle
into
a
pyre.
Nan
said
that
fiery
spirits
still
haunted
the
blackened
towers.
Sometimes
men
went
to
sleep
safe
in
their
beds
and
were
found
dead
in
the
morning,
all
burnt
up.
Arya
didnвЂ™t
really
believe
that,
and
anyhow
it
had
all
happened
a
long
time
ago.
Hot
Pie
was
being
silly;
it
wouldnвЂ™t
be
ghosts
at
Harrenhal,
it
would
be
knights.
Arya
could
reveal
herself
to
Lady
Whent,
and
the
knights
would
escort
her
home
and
keep
her
safe.
That
was
what
knights
did;
they
kept
you
safe,
especially
women.
Maybe
Lady
Whent
would
even
help
the
crying
girl.

The
river
track
was
no
kingsroad,
yet
it
was
not
half
bad
for
what
it
was,
and
for
once
the
wagons
rolled
along
smartly.
They
saw
the
first
house
an
hour
shy
of
evenfall,
a
snug
little
thatch-roofed
cottage
surrounded
by
fields
of
wheat.
Yoren
rode
out
ahead,
hallooing,
but
got
no
answer.
вЂњDead,
might
be.
Or
hiding.
Dobber,
Rey,
with
me.вЂќ
The
three
men
went
into
the
cottage.
вЂњPots
is
gone,
no
sign
oвЂ™
any
coin
laid
by,вЂќ
Yoren
muttered
when
they
returned.
вЂњNo
animals.
Run,
most
like.
Might
be
we
met
вЂem
on
the
kingsroad.вЂќ
At
least
the
house
and
field
had
not
been
burned,
and
there
were
no
corpses
about.
Tarber
found
a
garden
out
back,
and
they
pulled
some
onions
and
radishes
and
filled
a
sack
with
cabbages
before
they
went
on
their
way.

A
little
farther
up
the
road,
they
glimpsed
a
foresterвЂ™s
cabin
surrounded
by
old
trees
and
neatly
stacked
logs
ready
for
the
splitting,
and
later
a
ramshackle
stilt-house
leaning
over
the
river
on
poles
ten
feet
tall,
both
deserted.
They
passed
more
fields,
wheat
and
corn
and
barley
ripening
in
the
sun,
but
here
there
were
no
men
sitting
in
trees,
nor
walking
the
rows
with
scythes.
Finally
the
town
came
into
view;
a
cluster
of
white
houses
spread
out
around
the
walls
of
the
holdfast,
a
big
sept
with
a
shingled
wooden
roof,
the
lordвЂ™s
towerhouse
sitting
on
a
small
rise
to
the
westвЂ¦
and
no
sign
of
any
people,
anywhere.

Yoren
sat
on
his
horse,
frowning
through
his
tangle
of
beard.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
like
it,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbut
there
it
is.
WeвЂ™ll
go
have
us
a
look.
A
careful
look.
See
maybe
thereвЂ™s
some
folk
hiding.
Might
be
they
left
a
boat
behind,
or
some
weapons
we
can
use.вЂќ

The
black
brother
left
ten
to
guard
the
wagons
and
the
whimpery
little
girl,
and
split
the
rest
of
them
into
four
groups
of
five
to
search
the
town.
вЂњKeep
your
eyes
and
ears
open,вЂќ
he
warned
them,
before
he
rode
off
to
the
towerhouse
to
see
if
there
was
any
sign
of
the
lordling
or
his
guards.

Arya
found
herself
with
Gendry,
Hot
Pie,
and
Lommy.
Squat,
kettle-bellied
Woth
had
pulled
an
oar
on
a
galley
once,
which
made
him
the
next
best
thing
they
had
to
a
sailor,
so
Yoren
told
him
to
take
them
down
to
the
lakefront
and
see
if
they
could
find
a
boat.
As
they
rode
between
the
silent
white
houses,
gooseprickles
crawled
up
AryaвЂ™s
arms.
This
empty
town
frightened
her
almost
as
much
as
the
burnt
holdfast
where
theyвЂ™d
found
the
crying
girl
and
the
one-armed
woman.
Why
would
people
run
off
and
leave
their
homes
and
everything?
What
could
scare
them
so
much?

The
sun
was
low
to
the
west,
and
the
houses
cast
long
dark
shadows.
A
sudden
clap
of
sound
made
Arya
reach
for
Needle,
but
it
was
only
a
shutter
banging
in
the
wind.
After
the
open
river
shore,
the
closeness
of
the
town
unnerved
her.

When
she
glimpsed
the
lake
ahead
between
houses
and
trees,
Arya
put
her
knees
into
her
horse,
galloping
past
Woth
and
Gendry.
She
burst
out
onto
the
grassy
sward
beside
the
pebbled
shore.
The
setting
sun
made
the
tranquil
surface
of
the
water
shimmer
like
a
sheet
of
beaten
copper.
It
was
the
biggest
lake
she
had
ever
seen,
with
no
hint
of
a
far
shore.
She
saw
a
rambling
inn
to
her
left,
built
out
over
the
water
on
heavy
wooden
pilings.
To
her
right,
a
long
pier
jutted
into
the
lake,
and
there
were
other
docks
farther
east,
wooden
fingers
reaching
out
from
the
town.
But
the
only
boat
in
view
was
an
upside-down
rowboat
abandoned
on
the
rocks
beneath
the
inn,
its
bottom
thoroughly
rotted
out.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
gone,вЂќ
Arya
said,
dejected.
What
would
they
do
now?

вЂњThereвЂ™s
an
inn,вЂќ
Lommy
said,
when
the
others
rode
up.
вЂњDo
you
think
they
left
any
food?
Or
ale?вЂќ

вЂњLetвЂ™s
go
see,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
suggested.

вЂњNever
you
mind
about
no
inn,вЂќ
snapped
Woth.
вЂњYoren
said
weвЂ™re
to
find
a
boat.вЂќ

вЂњThey
took
the
boats.вЂќ
Somehow
Arya
knew
it
was
true;
they
could
search
the
whole
town,
and
theyвЂ™d
find
no
more
than
the
upside-down
rowboat.
Despondent,
she
climbed
off
her
horse
and
knelt
by
the
lake.
The
water
lapped
softly
around
her
legs.
A
few
lantern
bugs
were
coming
out,
their
little
lights
blinking
on
and
off.
The
green
water
was
warm
as
tears,
but
there
was
no
salt
in
it.
It
tasted
of
summer
and
mud
and
growing
things.
Arya
plunged
her
face
down
into
it
to
wash
off
the
dust
and
dirt
and
sweat
of
the
day.
When
she
leaned
back
the
trickles
ran
down
the
back
of
her
neck
and
under
her
collar.
They
felt
good.
She
wished
she
could
take
off
her
clothes
and
swim,
gliding
through
the
warm
water
like
an
skinny
pink
otter.
Maybe
she
could
swim
all
the
way
to
Winterfell.

Woth
was
shouting
at
her
to
help
search,
so
she
did,
peering
into
boathouses
and
sheds
while
her
horse
grazed
along
the
shore.
They
found
some
sails,
some
nails,
buckets
of
tar
gone
hard,
and
a
mother
cat
with
a
litter
of
new-born
kittens.
But
no
boats.

The
town
was
as
dark
as
any
forest
when
Yoren
and
the
others
reappeared.
вЂњTowerвЂ™s
empty,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњLordвЂ™s
gone
off
to
fight
maybe,
or
to
get
his
smallfolk
to
safety,
no
telling.
Not
a
horse
or
pig
left
in
town,
but
weвЂ™ll
eat.
Saw
a
goose
running
loose,
and
some
chickens,
and
thereвЂ™s
good
fish
in
the
Gods
Eye.вЂќ

вЂњThe
boats
are
gone,вЂќ
Arya
reported.

вЂњWe
could
patch
the
bottom
of
that
rowboat,вЂќ
said
Koss.

вЂњMight
do
for
four
oвЂ™
us,вЂќ
Yoren
said.

вЂњThereвЂ™s
nails,вЂќ
Lommy
pointed
out.
вЂњAnd
thereвЂ™s
trees
all
around.
We
could
build
us
all
boats.вЂќ

Yoren
spat.
вЂњYou
know
anything
вЂ™bout
boat-building,
dyerвЂ™s
boy?вЂќ
Lommy
looked
blank.

вЂњA
raft,вЂќ
suggested
Gendry.
вЂњAnyone
can
build
a
raft,
and
long
poles
for
pushing.вЂќ

Yoren
looked
thoughtful.
вЂњLakeвЂ™s
too
deep
to
pole
across,
but
if
we
stayed
to
the
shallows
near
shoreвЂ¦
itвЂ™d
mean
leaving
the
wagons.
Might
be
thatвЂ™s
best.
IвЂ™ll
sleep
on
it.вЂќ

вЂњCan
we
stay
at
the
inn?вЂќ
Lommy
asked.

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
stay
in
the
holdfast,
with
the
gates
barred,вЂќ
the
old
man
said.
вЂњI
like
the
feel
oвЂ™
stone
walls
about
me
when
I
sleep.вЂќ

Arya
could
not
keep
quiet.
вЂњWe
shouldnвЂ™t
stay
here,вЂќ
she
blurted.
вЂњThe
people
didnвЂ™t.
They
all
ran
off,
even
their
lord.вЂќ

вЂњArryвЂ™s
scared,вЂќ
Lommy
announced,
braying
laughter.

вЂњIвЂ™m
not,вЂќ
she
snapped
back,
вЂњbut
they
were.вЂќ

вЂњSmart
boy,вЂќ
said
Yoren.
вЂњThing
is,
the
folks
who
lived
here
were
at
war,
like
it
or
no.
WeвЂ™re
not.
NightвЂ™s
Watch
takes
no
part,
so
no
manвЂ™s
our
enemy.вЂќ

And
no
manвЂ™s
our
friend,
she
thought,
but
this
time
she
held
her
tongue.
Lommy
and
the
rest
were
looking
at
her,
and
she
did
not
want
to
seem
craven
in
front
of
them.

The
holdfast
gates
were
studded
with
iron
nails.
Within,
they
found
a
pair
of
iron
bars
the
size
of
saplings,
with
post
holes
in
the
ground
and
metal
brackets
on
the
gate.
When
they
slotted
the
bars
through
the
brackets,
they
made
a
huge
X
brace.
It
was
no
Red
Keep,
Yoren
announced
when
theyвЂ™d
explored
the
holdfast
top
to
bottom,
but
it
was
better
than
most,
and
should
do
for
a
night
well
enough.
The
walls
were
rough
unmortared
stone
ten
feet
high,
with
a
wooden
catwalk
inside
the
battlements.
There
was
a
postern
gate
to
the
north,
and
Gerren
discovered
a
trap
under
the
straw
in
the
old
wooden
barn,
leading
to
a
narrow,
winding
tunnel.
He
followed
it
a
long
way
under
the
earth
and
came
out
by
the
lake.
Yoren
had
them
roll
a
wagon
on
top
of
the
trap,
to
make
certain
no
one
came
in
that
way.
He
divided
them
into
three
watches,
and
sent
Tarber,
Kurz,
and
Cutjack
off
to
the
abandoned
towerhouse
to
keep
an
eye
out
from
on
high.
Kurz
had
a
hunting
horn
to
sound
if
danger
threatened.

They
drove
their
wagons
and
animals
inside
and
barred
the
gates
behind
them.
The
barn
was
a
ramshackle
thing,
large
enough
to
hold
half
the
animals
in
the
town.
The
haven,
where
the
townfolk
would
shelter
in
times
of
trouble,
was
even
larger,
low
and
long
and
built
of
stone,
with
a
thatched
roof.
Koss
went
out
the
postern
gate
and
brought
the
goose
back,
and
two
chickens
as
well,
and
Yoren
allowed
a
cookfire.
There
was
a
big
kitchen
inside
the
holdfast,
though
all
the
pots
and
kettles
had
been
taken.
Gendry,
Dobber,
and
Arya
drew
cook
duty.
Dobber
told
Arya
to
pluck
the
fowl
while
Gendry
split
wood.
вЂњWhy
canвЂ™t
I
split
the
wood?вЂќ
she
asked,
but
no
one
listened.
Sullenly,
she
set
to
plucking
a
chicken
while
Yoren
sat
on
the
end
of
the
bench
sharpening
the
edge
of
his
dirk
with
a
whetstone.

When
the
food
was
ready,
Arya
ate
a
chicken
leg
and
a
bit
of
onion.
No
one
talked
much,
not
even
Lommy.
Gendry
went
off
by
himself
afterward,
polishing
his
helm
with
a
look
on
his
face
like
he
wasnвЂ™t
even
there.
The
crying
girl
whimpered
and
wept,
but
when
Hot
Pie
offered
her
a
bit
of
goose
she
gobbled
it
down
and
looked
for
more.

Arya
drew
second
watch,
so
she
found
a
straw
pallet
in
the
haven.
Sleep
did
not
come
easy,
so
she
borrowed
YorenвЂ™s
stone
and
set
to
honing
Needle.
Syrio
Forel
had
said
that
a
dull
blade
was
like
a
lame
horse.
Hot
Pie
squatted
on
the
pallet
beside
her,
watching
her
work.
вЂњWhereвЂ™d
you
get
a
good
sword
like
that?вЂќ
he
asked.
When
he
saw
the
look
she
gave
him,
he
raised
his
hands
defensively.
вЂњI
never
said
you
stole
it,
I
just
wanted
to
know
where
you
got
it,
is
all.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brother
gave
it
to
me,вЂќ
she
muttered.

вЂњI
never
knew
you
had
no
brother.вЂќ

Arya
paused
to
scratch
under
her
shirt.
There
were
fleas
in
the
straw,
though
she
couldnвЂ™t
see
why
a
few
more
would
bother
her.
вЂњI
have
lots
of
brothers.вЂќ

вЂњYou
do?
Are
they
bigger
than
you,
or
littler?вЂќ

I
shouldnвЂ™t
be
talking
like
this.
Yoren
said
I
should
keep
my
mouth
shut.
вЂњBigger,вЂќ
she
lied.
вЂњThey
have
swords
too,
big
longswords,
and
they
showed
me
how
to
kill
people
who
bother
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
was
talking,
not
bothering.вЂќ
Hot
Pie
went
off
and
let
her
alone
and
Arya
curled
up
on
her
pallet.
She
could
hear
the
crying
girl
from
the
far
side
of
the
haven.
I
wish
sheвЂ™d
just
be
quiet.
Why
does
she
have
to
cry
all
the
time?

She
must
have
slept,
though
she
never
remembered
closing
her
eyes.
She
dreamed
a
wolf
was
howling,
and
the
sound
was
so
terrible
that
it
woke
her
at
once.
Arya
sat
up
on
her
pallet
with
her
heart
thumping.
вЂњHot
Pie,
wake
up.вЂќ
She
scrambled
to
her
feet.
вЂњWoth,
Gendry,
didnвЂ™t
you
hear?вЂќ
She
pulled
on
a
boot.

All
around
her,
men
and
boys
stirred
and
crawled
from
their
pallets.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
wrong?вЂќ
Hot
Pie
asked.
вЂњHear
what?вЂќ
Gendry
wanted
to
know.
вЂњArry
had
a
bad
dream,вЂќ
someone
else
said.

вЂњNo,
I
heard
it,вЂќ
she
insisted.
вЂњA
wolf.вЂќ

вЂњArry
has
wolves
in
his
head,вЂќ
sneered
Lommy.
вЂњLet
them
howl,вЂќ
Gerren
said,
вЂњtheyвЂ™re
out
there,
weвЂ™re
in
here.вЂќ
Woth
agreed.
вЂњNever
saw
no
wolf
could
storm
a
holdfast.вЂќ
Hot
Pie
was
saying,
вЂњI
never
heard
nothing.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
a
wolf,вЂќ
she
shouted
at
them
as
she
yanked
on
her
second
boot.
вЂњSomethingвЂ™s
wrong,
someoneвЂ™s
coming,
get
up!вЂќ

Before
they
could
hoot
her
down
again,
the
sound
came
shuddering
through
the
nightвЂ”only
it
was
no
wolf
this
time,
it
was
Kurz
blowing
his
hunting
horn,
sounding
danger.
In
a
heartbeat,
all
of
them
were
pulling
on
clothes
and
snatching
for
whatever
weapons
they
owned.
Arya
ran
for
the
gate
as
the
horn
sounded
again.
As
she
dashed
past
the
barn,
Biter
threw
himself
furiously
against
his
chains,
and
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
called
out
from
the
back
of
their
wagon.
вЂњBoy!
Sweet
boy!
Is
it
war,
red
war?
Boy,
free
us.
A
man
can
fight.
Boy!вЂќ
She
ignored
him
and
plunged
on.
By
then
she
could
hear
horses
and
shouts
beyond
the
wall.

She
scrambled
up
onto
the
catwalk.
The
parapets
were
a
bit
too
high
and
Arya
a
bit
too
short;
she
had
to
wedge
her
toes
into
the
holes
between
the
stones
to
see
over.
For
a
moment
she
thought
the
town
was
full
of
lantern
bugs.
Then
she
realized
they
were
men
with
torches,
galloping
between
the
houses.
She
saw
a
roof
go
up,
flames
licking
at
the
belly
of
the
night
with
hot
orange
tongues
as
the
thatch
caught.
Another
followed,
and
then
another,
and
soon
there
were
fires
blazing
everywhere.

Gendry
climbed
up
beside
her,
wearing
his
helm.
вЂњHow
many?вЂќ

Arya
tried
to
count,
but
they
were
riding
too
fast,
torches
spinning
through
the
air
as
they
flung
them.
вЂњA
hundred,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњTwo
hundred,
I
donвЂ™t
know.вЂќ
Over
the
roar
of
the
flames,
she
could
hear
shouts.
вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
come
for
us
soon.вЂќ

вЂњThere,вЂќ
Gendry
said,
pointing.

A
column
of
riders
moved
between
the
burning
buildings
toward
the
holdfast.
Firelight
glittered
off
metal
helms
and
spattered
their
mail
and
plate
with
orange
and
yellow
highlights.
One
carried
a
banner
on
a
tall
lance.
She
thought
it
was
red,
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
the
night,
with
the
fires
roaring
all
around.
Everything
seemed
red
or
black
or
orange.

The
fire
leapt
from
one
house
to
another.
Arya
saw
a
tree
consumed,
the
flames
creeping
across
its
branches
until
it
stood
against
the
night
in
robes
of
living
orange.
Everyone
was
awake
now,
manning
the
catwalks
or
struggling
with
the
frightened
animals
below.
She
could
hear
Yoren
shouting
commands.
Something
bumped
against
her
leg,
and
she
glanced
down
to
discover
the
crying
girl
clutching
her.
вЂњGet
away!вЂќ
She
wrenched
her
leg
free.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing
up
here?
Run
and
hide
someplace,
you
stupid.вЂќ
She
shoved
the
girl
away.

The
riders
reined
up
before
the
gates.
вЂњYou
in
the
holdfast!вЂќ
shouted
a
knight
in
a
tall
helm
with
a
spiked
crest.
вЂњOpen,
in
the
name
of
the
king!вЂќ

вЂњAye,
and
which
king
is
that?вЂќ
old
Reysen
yelled
back
down,
before
Woth
cuffed
him
into
silence.

Yoren
climbed
the
battlement
beside
the
gate,
his
faded
black
cloak
tied
to
a
wooden
staff.
вЂњYou
men
hold
down
here!вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњThe
townfolkвЂ™s
gone.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
who
are
you,
old
man?
One
of
Lord
BericвЂ™s
cravens?вЂќ
called
the
knight
in
the
spiked
helm.
вЂњIf
that
fat
fool
Thoros
is
in
there,
ask
him
how
he
likes
these
fires.вЂќ

вЂњGot
no
such
man
here,вЂќ
Yoren
shouted
back.
вЂњOnly
some
lads
for
the
Watch.
Got
no
part
oвЂ™
your
war.вЂќ
He
hoisted
up
the
staff,
so
they
could
all
see
the
color
of
his
cloak.
вЂњHave
a
look.
ThatвЂ™s
black,
for
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.вЂќ

вЂњOr
black
for
House
Dondarrion,вЂќ
called
the
man
who
bore
the
enemy
banner.
Arya
could
see
its
colors
more
clearly
now
in
the
light
of
the
burning
town:
a
golden
lion
on
red.
вЂњLord
BericвЂ™s
sigil
is
a
purple
lightning
bolt
on
a
black
field.вЂќ

Suddenly
Arya
remembered
the
morning
she
had
thrown
the
orange
in
SansaвЂ™s
face
and
gotten
juice
all
over
her
stupid
ivory
silk
gown.
There
had
been
some
southron
lordling
at
the
tourney,
her
sisterвЂ™s
stupid
friend
Jeyne
was
in
love
with
him.
He
had
a
lightning
bolt
on
his
shield
and
her
father
had
sent
him
out
to
behead
the
HoundвЂ™s
brother.
It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
now,
something
that
had
happened
to
a
different
person
in
a
different
lifeвЂ¦
to
Arya
Stark
the
HandвЂ™s
daughter,
not
Arry
the
orphan
boy.
How
would
Arry
know
lords
and
such?

вЂњAre
you
blind,
man?вЂќ
Yoren
waved
his
staff
back
and
forth,
making
the
cloak
ripple.
вЂњYou
see
a
bloody
lightning
bolt?вЂќ

вЂњBy
night
all
banners
look
black,вЂќ
the
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
observed.
вЂњOpen,
or
weвЂ™ll
know
you
for
outlaws
in
league
with
the
kingвЂ™s
enemies.вЂќ

Yoren
spat.
вЂњWhoвЂ™s
got
your
command?вЂќ

вЂњI
do.вЂќ
The
reflections
of
burning
houses
glimmered
dully
on
the
armor
of
his
warhorse
as
the
others
parted
to
let
him
pass.
He
was
a
stout
man
with
a
manticore
on
his
shield,
and
ornate
scrollwork
crawling
across
his
steel
breastplate.
Through
the
open
visor
of
his
helm,
a
face
pale
and
piggy
peered
up.
вЂњSer
Amory
Lorch,
bannerman
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
the
Hand
of
the
King.
The
true
king,
Joffrey.вЂќ
He
had
a
high,
thin
voice.
вЂњIn
his
name,
I
command
you
to
open
these
gates.вЂќ

All
around
them,
the
town
burned.
The
night
air
was
full
of
smoke,
and
the
drifting
red
embers
outnumbered
the
stars.
Yoren
scowled.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
see
the
need.
Do
what
you
want
to
the
town,
itвЂ™s
naught
to
me,
but
leave
us
be.
WeвЂ™re
no
foes
to
you.вЂќ

Look
with
your
eyes,
Arya
wanted
to
shout
at
the
men
below.
вЂњCanвЂ™t
they
see
weвЂ™re
no
lords
or
knights?вЂќ
she
whispered.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
think
they
care,
Arry,вЂќ
Gendry
whispered
back.

And
she
looked
at
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
face,
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her
to
look,
and
she
saw
that
he
was
right.

вЂњIf
you
are
no
traitors,
open
your
gates,вЂќ
Ser
Amory
called.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
make
certain
youвЂ™re
telling
it
true
and
be
on
our
way.вЂќ

Yoren
was
chewing
sourleaf.
вЂњTold
you,
no
one
here
but
us.
You
got
my
word
on
that.вЂќ

The
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
laughed.
вЂњThe
crow
gives
us
his
word.вЂќ

вЂњYou
lost,
old
man?вЂќ
mocked
one
of
the
spearmen.
вЂњThe
WallвЂ™s
a
long
way
north
oвЂ™
here.вЂќ

вЂњI
command
you
once
more,
in
King
JoffreyвЂ™s
name,
to
prove
the
loyalty
you
profess
and
open
these
gates,вЂќ
said
Ser
Amory.

For
a
long
moment
Yoren
considered,
chewing.
Then
he
spat.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
think
I
will.вЂќ

вЂњSo
be
it.
You
defy
the
kingвЂ™s
command,
and
so
proclaim
yourselves
rebels,
black
cloaks
or
no.вЂќ

вЂњGot
me
young
boys
in
here,вЂќ
Yoren
shouted
down.

вЂњYoung
boys
and
old
men
die
the
same.вЂќ
Ser
Amory
raised
a
lanquid
fist,
and
a
spear
came
hurtling
from
the
fire-bright
shadows
behind.
Yoren
must
have
been
the
target,
but
it
was
Woth
beside
him
who
was
hit.
The
spearhead
went
in
his
throat
and
exploded
out
the
back
of
his
neck,
dark
and
wet.
Woth
grabbed
at
the
shaft,
and
fell
boneless
from
the
walk.

вЂњStorm
the
walls
and
kill
them
all,вЂќ
Ser
Amory
said
in
a
bored
voice.
More
spears
flew.
Arya
yanked
down
Hot
Pie
by
the
back
of
his
tunic.
From
outside
came
the
rattle
of
armor,
the
scrape
of
swords
on
scabbards,
the
banging
of
spears
on
shields,
mingled
with
curses
and
the
hoofbeats
of
racing
horses.
A
torch
sailed
spinning
above
their
heads,
trailing
fingers
of
fire
as
it
thumped
down
in
the
dirt
of
the
yard.

вЂњBlades!вЂќ
Yoren
shouted.
вЂњSpread
apart,
defend
the
wall
wherever
they
hit.
Koss,
Urreg,
hold
the
postern.
Lommy,
pull
that
spear
out
of
Woth
and
get
up
where
he
was.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
dropped
his
shortsword
when
he
tried
to
unsheath
it.
Arya
shoved
the
blade
back
into
his
hand.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
know
how
to
swordfight,вЂќ
he
said,
white-eyed.

вЂњItвЂ™s
easy,вЂќ
Arya
said,
but
the
lie
died
in
her
throat
as
a
hand
grasped
the
top
of
the
parapet.
She
saw
it
by
the
light
of
the
burning
town,
so
clear
that
it
was
as
if
time
had
stopped.
The
fingers
were
blunt,
callused,
wiry
black
hairs
grew
between
the
knuckles,
there
was
dirt
under
the
nail
of
the
thumb.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
remembered
as
the
top
of
a
pothelm
loomed
up
behind
the
hand.

She
slashed
down
hard,
and
NeedleвЂ™s
castle-forged
steel
bit
into
the
grasping
fingers
between
the
knuckles.
вЂњWinterfell!вЂќ
she
screamed.
Blood
spurted,
fingers
flew,
and
the
helmed
face
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared.
вЂњBehind!вЂќ
Hot
Pie
yelled.
Arya
whirled.
The
second
man
was
bearded
and
helmetless,
his
dirk
between
his
teeth
to
leave
both
hands
free
for
climbing.
As
he
swung
his
leg
over
the
parapet,
she
drove
her
point
at
his
eyes.
Needle
never
touched
him;
he
reeled
backward
and
fell.
I
hope
he
falls
on
his
face
and
cuts
off
his
tongue.
вЂњWatch
them,
not
me!вЂќ
she
screamed
at
Hot
Pie.
The
next
time
someone
tried
to
climb
their
part
of
the
wall,
the
boy
hacked
at
his
hands
with
his
swordshort
until
the
man
dropped
away.

Ser
Amory
had
no
ladders,
but
the
holdfast
walls
were
rough-cut
and
unmortared,
easy
to
climb,
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
foes.
For
each
one
Arya
cut
or
stabbed
or
shoved
back,
another
was
coming
over
the
wall.
The
knight
in
the
spiked
helm
reached
the
rampart,
but
Yoren
tangled
his
black
banner
around
his
spike,
and
forced
the
point
of
his
dirk
through
his
armor
while
the
man
was
fighting
the
cloth.
Every
time
Arya
looked
up,
more
torches
were
flying,
trailing
long
tongues
of
flame
that
lingered
behind
her
eyes.
She
saw
a
gold
lion
on
a
red
banner
and
thought
of
Joffrey,
wishing
he
was
here
so
she
could
drive
Needle
through
his
sneery
face.
When
four
men
assaulted
the
gate
with
axes,
Koss
shot
them
down
with
arrows,
one
by
one.
Dobber
wrestled
a
man
off
the
walk,
and
Lommy
smashed
his
head
with
a
rock
before
he
could
rise,
and
hooted
until
he
saw
the
knife
in
DobberвЂ™s
belly
and
realized
he
wouldnвЂ™t
be
getting
up
either.
Arya
jumped
over
a
dead
boy
no
older
than
Jon,
lying
with
his
arm
cut
off.
She
didnвЂ™t
think
sheвЂ™d
done
it,
but
she
wasnвЂ™t
sure.
She
heard
Qyle
beg
for
mercy
before
a
knight
with
a
wasp
on
his
shield
smashed
his
face
in
with
a
spiked
mace.
Everything
smelled
of
blood
and
smoke
and
iron
and
piss,
but
after
a
time
it
seemed
like
that
was
only
one
smell.
She
never
saw
how
the
skinny
man
got
over
the
wall,
but
when
he
did
she
fell
on
him
with
Gendry
and
Hot
Pie.
GendryвЂ™s
sword
shattered
on
the
manвЂ™s
helm,
tearing
it
off
his
head.
Underneath
he
was
bald
and
scared-looking,
with
missing
teeth
and
a
speckly
grey
beard,
but
even
as
she
was
feeling
sorry
for
him
she
was
killing
him,
shouting,
вЂњWinterfell!
Winterfell!вЂќ
while
Hot
Pie
screamed
вЂњHot
Pie!вЂќ
beside
her
as
he
hacked
at
the
manвЂ™s
scrawny
neck.

When
the
skinny
man
was
dead,
Gendry
stole
his
sword
and
leapt
down
into
the
yard
to
fight
some
more.
Arya
looked
past
him,
and
saw
steel
shadows
running
through
the
holdfast,
firelight
shining
off
mail
and
blades,
and
she
knew
that
theyвЂ™d
gotten
over
the
wall
somewhere,
or
broken
through
at
the
postern.
She
jumped
down
beside
Gendry,
landing
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her.
The
night
rang
to
the
clash
of
steel
and
the
cries
of
the
wounded
and
dying.
For
a
moment
Arya
stood
uncertain,
not
knowing
which
way
to
go.
Death
was
all
around
her.

And
then
Yoren
was
there,
shaking
her,
screaming
in
her
face.
вЂњBoy!вЂќ
he
yelled,
the
way
he
always
yelled
it.
вЂњGet
out,
itвЂ™s
done,
weвЂ™ve
lost.
Herd
up
all
you
can,
you
and
him
and
the
others,
the
boys,
you
get
them
out.
Now!вЂќ

вЂњHow?вЂќ
Arya
said.

вЂњThat
trap,вЂќ
he
screamed.
вЂњUnder
the
barn.вЂќ

Quick
as
that
he
was
gone,
off
to
fight,
sword
in
hand.
Arya
grabbed
Gendry
by
the
arm.
вЂњHe
said
go,вЂќ
she
shouted,
вЂњthe
barn,
the
way
out.вЂќ
Through
the
slits
of
his
helm,
the
BullвЂ™s
eyes
shone
with
reflected
fire.
He
nodded.
They
called
Hot
Pie
down
from
the
wall
and
found
Lommy
Greenhands
where
he
lay
bleeding
from
a
spear
thrust
through
his
calf.
They
found
Gerren
too,
but
he
was
hurt
too
bad
to
move.
As
they
were
running
toward
the
barn,
Arya
spied
the
crying
girl
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
chaos,
surrounded
by
smoke
and
slaughter.
She
grabbed
her
by
the
hand
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
as
the
others
raced
ahead.
The
girl
wouldnвЂ™t
walk,
even
when
slapped.
Arya
dragged
her
with
her
right
hand
while
she
held
Needle
in
the
left.
Ahead,
the
night
was
a
sullen
red.
The
barnвЂ™s
on
fire,
she
thought.
Flames
were
licking
up
its
sides
from
where
a
torch
had
fallen
on
straw,
and
she
could
hear
the
screaming
of
the
animals
trapped
within.
Hot
Pie
stepped
out
of
the
barn.
вЂњArry,
come
on!
LommyвЂ™s
gone,
leave
her
if
she
wonвЂ™t
come!вЂќ

Stubbornly,
Arya
dragged
all
the
harder,
pulling
the
crying
girl
along.
Hot
Pie
scuttled
back
inside,
abandoning
themвЂ¦
but
Gendry
came
back,
the
fire
shining
so
bright
on
his
polished
helm
that
the
horns
seemed
to
glow
orange.
He
ran
to
them,
and
hoisted
the
crying
girl
up
over
his
shoulder.
вЂњRun!вЂќ

Rushing
through
the
barn
doors
was
like
running
into
a
furnace.
The
air
was
swirling
with
smoke,
the
back
wall
a
sheet
of
fire
ground
to
roof.
Their
horses
and
donkeys
were
kicking
and
rearing
and
screaming.
The
poor
animals,
Arya
thought.
Then
she
saw
the
wagon,
and
the
three
men
manacled
to
its
bed.
Biter
was
flinging
himself
against
the
chains,
blood
running
down
his
arms
from
where
the
irons
clasped
his
wrists.
Rorge
screamed
curses,
kicking
at
the
wood.
вЂњBoy!вЂќ
called
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar.
вЂњSweet
boy!вЂќ

The
open
trap
was
only
a
few
feet
ahead,
but
the
fire
was
spreading
fast,
consuming
the
old
wood
and
dry
straw
faster
than
she
would
have
believed.
Arya
remembered
the
HoundвЂ™s
horrible
burned
face.
вЂњTunnelвЂ™s
narrow,вЂќ
Gendry
shouted.
вЂњHow
do
we
get
her
through?вЂќ

вЂњPull
her,вЂќ
Arya
said.
вЂњPush
her.вЂќ

вЂњGood
boys,
kind
boys,вЂќ
called
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
coughing.

вЂњGet
these
fucking
chains
off!вЂќ
Rorge
screamed.

Gendry
ignored
them.
вЂњYou
go
first,
then
her,
then
me.
Hurry,
itвЂ™s
a
long
way.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
you
split
the
firewood,вЂќ
Arya
remembered,
вЂњwhere
did
you
leave
the
axe?вЂќ

вЂњOut
by
the
haven.вЂќ
He
spared
a
glance
for
the
chained
men.
вЂњIвЂ™d
save
the
donkeys
first.
ThereвЂ™s
no
time.вЂќ

вЂњYou
take
her!вЂќ
she
yelled.
вЂњYou
get
her
out!
You
do
it!вЂќ
The
fire
beat
at
her
back
with
hot
red
wings
as
she
fled
the
burning
barn.
It
felt
blessedly
cool
outside,
but
men
were
dying
all
around
her.
She
saw
Koss
throw
down
his
blade
to
yield,
and
she
saw
them
kill
him
where
he
stood.
Smoke
was
everywhere.
There
was
no
sign
of
Yoren,
but
the
axe
was
where
Gendry
had
left
it,
by
the
woodpile
outside
the
haven.
As
she
wrenched
it
free,
a
mailed
hand
grabbed
her
arm.
Spinning,
Arya
drove
the
head
of
the
axe
hard
between
his
legs.
She
never
saw
his
face,
only
the
dark
blood
seeping
between
the
links
of
his
hauberk.
Going
back
into
that
barn
was
the
hardest
thing
she
ever
did.
Smoke
was
pouring
out
the
open
door
like
a
writhing
black
snake,
and
she
could
hear
the
screams
of
the
poor
animals
inside,
donkeys
and
horses
and
men.
She
chewed
her
lip,
and
darted
through
the
doors,
crouched
low
where
the
smoke
wasnвЂ™t
quite
so
thick.

A
donkey
was
caught
in
a
ring
of
fire,
shrieking
in
terror
and
pain.
She
could
smell
the
stench
of
burning
hair.
The
roof
was
gone
up
too,
and
things
were
falling
down,
pieces
of
flaming
wood
and
bits
of
straw
and
hay.
Arya
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth
and
nose.
She
couldnвЂ™t
see
the
wagon
for
the
smoke,
but
she
could
still
hear
Biter
screaming.
She
crawled
toward
the
sound.

And
then
a
wheel
was
looming
over
her.
The
wagon
jumped
and
moved
a
half
foot
when
Biter
threw
himself
against
his
chains
again.
Jaqen
saw
her,
but
it
was
too
hard
to
breathe,
let
alone
talk.
She
threw
the
axe
into
the
wagon.
Rorge
caught
it
and
lifted
it
over
his
head,
rivers
of
sooty
sweat
pouring
down
his
noseless
face.
Arya
was
running,
coughing.
She
heard
the
steel
crash
through
the
old
wood,
and
again,
again.
An
instant
later
came
a
crack
as
loud
as
thunder,
and
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
came
ripping
loose
in
an
explosion
of
splinters.

Arya
rolled
headfirst
into
the
tunnel
and
dropped
five
feet.
She
got
dirt
in
her
mouth
but
she
didnвЂ™t
care,
the
taste
was
fine,
the
taste
was
mud
and
water
and
worms
and
life.
Under
the
earth
the
air
was
cool
and
dark.
Above
was
nothing
but
blood
and
roaring
red
and
choking
smoke
and
the
screams
of
dying
horses.
She
moved
her
belt
around
so
Needle
would
not
be
in
her
way,
and
began
to
crawl.
A
dozen
feet
down
the
tunnel
she
heard
the
sound,
like
the
roar
of
some
monstrous
beast,
and
a
cloud
of
hot
smoke
and
black
dust
came
billowing
up
behind
her,
smelling
of
hell.
Arya
held
her
breath
and
kissed
the
mud
on
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
and
cried.
For
whom,
she
could
not
say.





TYRION

The
queen
was
not
disposed
to
wait
on
Varys.
вЂњTreason
is
vile
enough,вЂќ
she
declared
furiously,
вЂњbut
this
is
barefaced
naked
villainy,
and
I
do
not
need
that
mincing
eunuch
to
tell
me
what
must
be
done
with
villains.вЂќ

Tyrion
took
the
letters
from
his
sisterвЂ™s
hand
and
compared
them
side
by
side.
There
were
two
copies,
the
words
exactly
alike,
though
they
had
been
written
by
different
hands.

вЂњMaester
Frenken
received
the
first
missive
at
Castle
Stokeworth,вЂќ
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
explained.
вЂњThe
second
copy
came
through
Lord
Gyles.вЂќ

Littlefinger
fingered
his
beard.
вЂњIf
Stannis
bothered
with
them,
itвЂ™s
past
certain
every
other
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
saw
a
copy
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњI
want
these
letters
burned,
every
one,вЂќ
Cersei
declared.
вЂњNo
hint
of
this
must
reach
my
sonвЂ™s
ears,
or
my
fatherвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњI
imagine
FatherвЂ™s
heard
rather
more
than
a
hint
by
now,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
dryly.
вЂњDoubtless
Stannis
sent
a
bird
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
another
to
Harrenhal.
As
for
burning
the
letters,
to
what
point?
The
song
is
sung,
the
wine
is
spilled,
the
wench
is
pregnant.
And
this
is
not
as
dire
as
it
seems,
in
truth.вЂќ

Cersei
turned
on
him
in
green-eyed
fury.
вЂњAre
you
utterly
witless?
Did
you
read
what
he
says?
The
boy
Joffrey,
he
calls
him.
And
he
dares
to
accuse
me
of
incest,
adultery,
and
treason!вЂќ

Only
because
youвЂ™re
guilty.
It
was
astonishing
to
see
how
angry
Cersei
could
wax
over
accusations
she
knew
perfectly
well
to
be
true.
If
we
lose
the
war,
she
ought
to
take
up
mummery,
she
has
a
gift
for
it.
Tyrion
waited
until
she
was
done
and
said,
вЂњStannis
must
have
some
pretext
to
justify
his
rebellion.
What
did
you
expect
him
to
write?
вЂJoffrey
is
my
brotherвЂ™s
trueborn
son
and
heir,
but
I
mean
to
take
his
throne
for
all
thatвЂ™?вЂќ

вЂњI
will
not
suffer
to
be
called
a
whore!вЂќ

Why,
sister,
he
never
claims
Jaime
paid
you.
Tyrion
made
a
show
of
glancing
over
the
writing
again.
There
had
been
some
niggling
phraseвЂ¦вЂњDone
in
the
Light
of
the
Lord,вЂќ
he
read.
вЂњA
queer
choice
of
words,
that.вЂќ

Pycelle
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњThese
words
often
appear
in
letters
and
documents
from
the
Free
Cities.
They
mean
no
more
than,
let
us
say,
written
in
the
sight
of
god.
The
god
of
the
red
priests.
It
is
their
usage,
I
do
believe.вЂќ

вЂњVarys
told
us
some
years
past
that
Lady
Selyse
had
taken
up
with
a
red
priest,вЂќ
Littlefinger
reminded
them.

Tyrion
tapped
the
paper.
вЂњAnd
now
it
would
seem
her
lord
husband
has
done
the
same.
We
can
use
that
against
him.
Urge
the
High
Septon
to
reveal
how
Stannis
has
turned
against
the
gods
as
well
as
his
rightful
kingвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYes,
yes,вЂќ
the
queen
said
impatiently,
вЂњbut
first
we
must
stop
this
filth
from
spreading
further.
The
council
must
issue
an
edict.
Any
man
heard
speaking
of
incest
or
calling
Joff
a
bastard
should
lose
his
tongue
for
it.вЂќ

вЂњA
prudent
measure,вЂќ
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
his
chain
of
office
clinking
as
he
nodded.

вЂњA
folly,вЂќ
sighed
Tyrion.
вЂњWhen
you
tear
out
a
manвЂ™s
tongue,
you
are
not
proving
him
a
liar,
youвЂ™re
only
telling
the
world
that
you
fear
what
he
might
say.вЂќ

вЂњSo
what
would
you
have
us
do?вЂќ
his
sister
demanded.

вЂњVery
little.
Let
them
whisper,
theyвЂ™ll
grow
bored
with
the
tale
soon
enough.
Any
man
with
a
thimble
of
sense
will
see
it
for
a
clumsy
attempt
to
justify
usurping
the
crown.
Does
Stannis
offer
proof?
How
could
he,
when
it
never
happened?вЂќ
Tyrion
gave
his
sister
his
sweetest
smile.

вЂњThatвЂ™s
so,вЂќ
she
had
to
say.
вЂњStillвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,
your
brother
has
the
right
of
this.вЂќ
Petyr
Baelish
steepled
his
fingers.
вЂњIf
we
attempt
to
silence
this
talk,
we
only
lend
it
credence.
Better
to
treat
it
with
contempt,
like
the
pathetic
lie
it
is.
And
meantime,
fight
fire
with
fire.вЂќ

Cersei
gave
him
a
measuring
look.
вЂњWhat
sort
of
fire?вЂќ

вЂњA
tale
of
somewhat
the
same
nature,
perhaps.
But
more
easily
believed.
Lord
Stannis
has
spent
most
of
his
marriage
apart
from
his
wife.
Not
that
I
fault
him,
IвЂ™d
do
the
same
were
I
married
to
Lady
Selyse.
Nonetheless,
if
we
put
it
about
that
her
daughter
is
baseborn
and
Stannis
a
cuckold,
wellвЂ¦
the
smallfolk
are
always
eager
to
believe
the
worst
of
their
lords,
particularly
those
as
stern,
sour,
and
prickly
proud
as
Stannis
Baratheon.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has
never
been
much
loved,
thatвЂ™s
true.вЂќ
Cersei
considered
a
moment.
вЂњSo
we
pay
him
back
in
his
own
coin.
Yes,
I
like
this.
Who
can
we
name
as
Lady
SelyseвЂ™s
lover?
She
has
two
brothers,
I
believe.
And
one
of
her
uncles
has
been
with
her
on
Dragonstone
all
this
timeвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSer
Axell
Florent
is
her
castellan.вЂќ
Loath
as
Tyrion
was
to
admit
it,
LittlefingerвЂ™s
scheme
had
promise.
Stannis
had
never
been
enamored
of
his
wife,
but
he
was
bristly
as
a
hedgehog
where
his
honor
was
concerned
and
mistrustful
by
nature.
If
they
could
sow
discord
between
him
and
his
followers,
it
could
only
help
their
cause.
вЂњThe
child
has
the
Florent
ears,
IвЂ™m
told.вЂќ

Littlefinger
gestured
languidly.
вЂњA
trade
envoy
from
Lys
once
observed
to
me
that
Lord
Stannis
must
love
his
daughter
very
well,
since
heвЂ™d
erected
hundreds
of
statues
of
her
all
along
the
walls
of
Dragonstone.
вЂMy
lordвЂ™
I
had
to
tell
him,
вЂthose
are
gargoyles.вЂ™вЂќ
He
chuckled.
вЂњSer
Axell
might
serve
for
ShireenвЂ™s
father,
but
in
my
experience,
the
more
bizarre
and
shocking
a
tale
the
more
apt
it
is
to
be
repeated.
Stannis
keeps
an
especially
grotesque
fool,
a
lackwit
with
a
tattooed
face.вЂќ

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
gaped
at
him,
aghast.
вЂњSurely
you
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
Lady
Selyse
would
bring
a
fool
into
her
bed?вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
have
to
be
a
fool
to
want
to
bed
Selyse
Florent,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger.
вЂњDoubtless
Patchface
reminded
her
of
Stannis.
And
the
best
lies
contain
within
them
nuggets
of
truth,
enough
to
give
a
listener
pause.
As
it
happens,
this
fool
is
utterly
devoted
to
the
girl
and
follows
her
everywhere.
They
even
look
somewhat
alike.
Shireen
has
a
mottled,
half-frozen
face
as
well.вЂќ

Pycelle
was
lost.
вЂњBut
that
is
from
the
greyscale
that
near
killed
her
as
a
babe,
poor
thing.вЂќ

вЂњI
like
my
tale
better,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger,
вЂњand
so
will
the
smallfolk.
Most
of
them
believe
that
if
a
woman
eats
rabbit
while
pregnant,
her
child
will
be
born
with
long
floppy
ears.вЂќ

Cersei
smiled
the
sort
of
smile
she
customarily
reserved
for
Jaime.
вЂњLord
Petyr,
you
are
a
wicked
creature.вЂќ

вЂњThank
you,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
most
accomplished
liar,вЂќ
Tyrion
added,
less
warmly.
This
one
is
more
dangerous
than
I
knew,
he
reflected.

LittlefingerвЂ™s
grey-green
eyes
met
the
dwarfвЂ™s
mismatched
stare
with
no
hint
of
unease.
вЂњWe
all
have
our
gifts,
my
lord.вЂќ

The
queen
was
too
caught
up
in
her
revenge
to
take
note
of
the
exchange.
вЂњCuckolded
by
a
halfwit
fool!
Stannis
will
be
laughed
at
in
every
winesink
this
side
of
the
narrow
sea.вЂќ

вЂњThe
story
should
not
come
from
us,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
вЂњor
it
will
be
seen
for
a
self-serving
lie.вЂќ
Which
it
is,
to
be
sure.

Once
more
Littlefinger
supplied
the
answer.
вЂњWhores
love
to
gossip,
and
as
it
happens
I
own
a
brothel
or
three.
And
no
doubt
Varys
can
plant
seeds
in
the
alehouses
and
pot-shops.вЂќ

вЂњVarys,вЂќ
Cersei
said,
frowning.
вЂњWhere
is
Varys?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
been
wondering
about
that
myself,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Spider
spins
his
secret
webs
day
and
night,вЂќ
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said
ominously.
вЂњI
mistrust
that
one,
my
lords.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
he
speaks
so
kindly
of
you.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
himself
off
his
chair.
As
it
happened,
he
knew
what
the
eunuch
was
about,
but
it
was
nothing
the
other
councillors
needed
to
hear.
вЂњPray
excuse
me,
my
lords.
Other
business
calls.вЂќ

Cersei
was
instantly
suspicious.
вЂњKingвЂ™s
business?вЂќ

вЂњNothing
you
need
trouble
yourself
about.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
the
judge
of
that.вЂќ

вЂњWould
you
spoil
my
surprise?вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњIвЂ™m
having
a
gift
made
for
Joffrey.
A
little
chain.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
does
he
need
with
another
chain?
He
has
gold
chains
and
silver,
more
than
he
can
wear.
If
you
think
for
a
moment
you
can
buy
JoffвЂ™s
love
with
giftsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhy,
surely
I
have
the
kingвЂ™s
love,
as
he
has
mine.
And
this
chain
I
believe
he
may
one
day
treasure
above
all
others.вЂќ
The
little
man
bowed
and
waddled
to
the
door.

Bronn
was
waiting
outside
the
council
chambers
to
escort
him
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
вЂњThe
smiths
are
in
your
audience
chamber,
waiting
your
pleasure,вЂќ
he
said
as
they
crossed
the
ward.

вЂњWaiting
my
pleasure.
I
like
the
ring
of
that,
Bronn.
You
almost
sound
a
proper
courtier.
Next
youвЂ™ll
be
kneeling.вЂќ

вЂњFuck
you,
dwarf.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
ShaeвЂ™s
task.вЂќ
Tyrion
heard
Lady
Tanda
calling
to
him
merrily
from
the
top
of
the
serpentine
steps.
Pretending
not
to
notice
her,
he
waddled
a
bit
faster.
вЂњSee
that
my
litter
is
readied,
IвЂ™ll
be
leaving
the
castle
as
soon
as
IвЂ™m
done
here.вЂќ
Two
of
the
Moon
Brothers
had
the
door
guard.
Tyrion
greeted
them
pleasantly,
and
grimaced
before
starting
up
the
stairs.
The
climb
to
his
bedchamber
made
his
legs
ache.

Within
he
found
a
boy
of
twelve
laying
out
clothing
on
the
bed;
his
squire,
such
that
he
was.
Podrick
Payne
was
so
shy
he
was
furtive.
Tyrion
had
never
quite
gotten
over
the
suspicion
that
his
father
had
inflicted
the
boy
on
him
as
a
joke.

вЂњYour
garb,
my
lord,вЂќ
the
boy
mumbled
when
Tyrion
entered,
staring
down
at
his
boots.
Even
when
he
worked
up
the
courage
to
speak,
Pod
could
never
quite
manage
to
look
at
you.
вЂњFor
the
audience.
And
your
chain.
The
HandвЂ™s
chain.вЂќ

вЂњVery
good.
Help
me
dress.вЂќ
The
doublet
was
black
velvet
covered
with
golden
studs
in
the
shape
of
lionsвЂ™
heads,
the
chain
a
loop
of
solid
gold
hands,
the
fingers
of
each
clasping
the
wrist
of
the
next.
Pod
brought
him
a
cloak
of
crimson
silk
fringed
in
gold,
cut
to
his
height.
On
a
normal
man,
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
half
cape.

The
HandвЂ™s
private
audience
chamber
was
not
so
large
as
the
kingвЂ™s,
nor
a
patch
on
the
vastness
of
the
throne
room,
but
Tyrion
liked
its
Myrish
rugs,
wall
hangings,
and
sense
of
intimacy.
As
he
entered,
his
steward
cried
out,
вЂњTyrion
Lannister,
Hand
of
the
King.вЂќ
He
liked
that
too.
The
gaggle
of
smiths,
armorers,
and
ironmongers
that
Bronn
had
collected
fell
to
their
knees.

He
hoisted
himself
up
into
the
high
seat
under
the
round
golden
window
and
bid
them
rise.
вЂњGoodmen,
I
know
you
are
all
busy,
so
I
will
be
succinct.
Pod,
if
you
please.вЂќ
The
boy
handed
him
a
canvas
sack.
Tyrion
yanked
the
drawstring
and
upended
the
bag.
Its
contents
spilled
onto
the
rug
with
a
muffled
thunk
of
metal
on
wool.
вЂњI
had
these
made
at
the
castle
forge.
I
want
a
thousand
more
just
like
them.вЂќ

One
of
the
smiths
knelt
to
inspect
the
object:
three
immense
steel
links,
twisted
together.
вЂњA
mighty
chain.вЂќ

вЂњMighty,
but
short,вЂќ
the
dwarf
replied.
вЂњSomewhat
like
me.
I
fancy
one
a
good
deal
longer.
Do
you
have
a
name?вЂќ

вЂњThey
call
me
Ironbelly,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ
The
smith
was
squat
and
broad,
plainly
dressed
in
wool
and
leather,
but
his
arms
were
as
thick
as
a
bullвЂ™s
neck.

вЂњI
want
every
forge
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
turned
to
making
these
links
and
joining
them.
All
other
work
is
to
be
put
aside.
I
want
every
man
who
knows
the
art
of
working
metal
set
to
this
task,
be
he
master,
journeyman,
or
apprentice.
When
I
ride
up
the
Street
of
Steel,
I
want
to
hear
hammers
ringing,
night
or
day.
And
I
want
a
man,
a
strong
man,
to
see
that
all
this
is
done.
Are
you
that
man,
Goodman
Ironbelly?вЂќ

вЂњMight
be
I
am,
mвЂ™lord.
But
what
of
the
mail
and
swords
the
queen
was
wanting?вЂќ

Another
smith
spoke
up.
вЂњHer
Grace
commanded
us
to
make
chainmail
and
armor,
swords
and
daggers
and
axes,
all
in
great
numbers.
For
arming
her
new
gold
cloaks,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

вЂњThat
work
can
wait,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњThe
chain
first.вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord,
begging
your
pardon,
Her
Grace
said
those
as
didnвЂ™t
meet
their
numbers
would
have
their
hands
crushed,вЂќ
the
anxious
Smith
persisted.
вЂњSmashed
on
their
own
anvils,
she
said.вЂќ

Sweet
Cersei,
always
striving
to
make
the
smallfolk
love
us.
вЂњNo
one
will
have
their
hands
smashed.
You
have
my
word
on
it.вЂќ

вЂњIron
is
grown
dear,вЂќ
Ironbelly
declared,
вЂњand
this
chain
will
be
needing
much
of
it,
and
coke
beside,
for
the
fires.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Baelish
will
see
that
you
have
coin
as
you
need
it,вЂќ
Tyrion
promised.
He
could
count
on
Littlefinger
for
that
much,
he
hoped.
вЂњI
will
command
the
City
Watch
to
help
you
find
iron.
Melt
down
every
horseshoe
in
this
city
if
you
must.вЂќ

An
older
man
moved
forward,
richly
dressed
in
a
damask
tunic
with
silver
fastenings
and
a
cloak
lined
with
foxfur.
He
knelt
to
examine
the
great
steel
links
Tyrion
had
dumped
on
the
floor.
вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
he
announced
gravely,
вЂњthis
is
crude
work
at
best.
There
is
no
art
to
it.
Suitable
labor
for
common
smiths,
no
doubt,
for
men
who
bend
horseshoes
and
hammer
out
kettles,
but
I
am
a
master
armorer,
as
it
please
my
lord.
This
is
no
work
for
me,
nor
my
fellow
masters.
We
make
swords
as
sharp
as
song,
armor
such
as
a
god
might
wear.
Not
this.вЂќ

Tyrion
tilted
his
head
to
the
side
and
gave
the
man
a
dose
of
his
mismatched
eyes.
вЂњWhat
is
your
name,
master
armorer?вЂќ

вЂњSalloreon,
as
it
please
my
lord.
If
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand
will
permit,
I
should
be
most
honored
to
forge
him
a
suit
of
armor
suitable
to
his
House
and
high
office.вЂќ
Two
of
the
others
sniggered,
but
Salloreon
plunged
ahead,
heedless.
вЂњPlate
and
scale,
I
think.
The
scales
gilded
bright
as
the
sun,
the
plate
enameled
a
deep
Lannister
crimson.
I
would
suggest
a
demonвЂ™s
head
for
a
helm,
crowned
with
tall
golden
horns.
When
you
ride
into
battle,
men
will
shrink
away
in
fear.вЂќ

A
demonвЂ™s
head,
Tyrion
thought
ruefully,
now
what
does
that
say
of
me?
вЂњMaster
Salloreon,
I
plan
to
fight
the
rest
of
my
battles
from
this
chair.
ItвЂ™s
links
I
need,
not
demon
horns.
So
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way.
You
will
make
chains,
or
you
will
wear
them.
The
choice
is
yours.вЂќ
He
rose,
and
took
his
leave
with
nary
a
backward
glance.

Bronn
was
waiting
by
the
gate
with
his
litter
and
an
escort
of
mounted
Black
Ears.
вЂњYou
know
where
weвЂ™re
bound,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
him.
He
accepted
a
hand
up
into
the
litter.
He
had
done
all
he
could
to
feed
the
hungry
cityвЂ”heвЂ™d
set
several
hundred
carpenters
to
building
fishing
boats
in
place
of
catapults,
opened
the
kingswood
to
any
hunter
who
dared
to
cross
the
river,
even
sent
gold
cloaks
foraging
to
the
west
and
southвЂ”yet
he
still
saw
accusing
eyes
everywhere
he
rode.
The
litterвЂ™s
curtains
shielded
him
from
that,
and
besides
gave
him
leisure
to
think.

As
they
wound
their
slow
way
down
twisty
Shadowblack
Lane
to
the
foot
of
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill,
Tyrion
reflected
on
the
events
of
the
morning.
His
sisterвЂ™s
ire
had
led
her
to
overlook
the
true
significance
of
Stannis
BaratheonвЂ™s
letter.
Without
proof,
his
accusations
were
nothing;
what
mattered
was
that
he
had
named
himself
a
king.
And
what
will
Renly
make
of
that?
They
could
not
both
sit
the
Iron
Throne.

Idly,
he
pushed
the
curtain
back
a
few
inches
to
peer
out
at
the
streets.
Black
Ears
rode
on
both
sides
of
him,
their
grisly
necklaces
looped
about
their
throats,
while
Bronn
went
in
front
to
clear
the
way.
He
watched
the
passersby
watching
him,
and
played
a
little
game
with
himself,
trying
to
sort
the
informers
from
the
rest.
The
ones
who
look
the
most
suspicious
are
likely
innocent,
he
decided.
ItвЂ™s
the
ones
who
look
innocent
I
need
to
beware.

His
destination
was
behind
the
hill
of
Rhaenys,
and
the
streets
were
crowded.
Almost
an
hour
had
passed
before
the
litter
swayed
to
a
stop.
Tyrion
was
dozing,
but
he
woke
abruptly
when
the
motion
ceased,
rubbed
the
sand
from
his
eyes,
and
accepted
BronnвЂ™s
hand
to
climb
down.

The
house
was
two
stories
tall,
stone
below
and
timber
above.
A
round
turret
rose
from
one
corner
of
the
structure.
Many
of
the
windows
were
leaded.
Over
the
door
swung
an
ornate
lamp,
a
globe
of
gilded
metal
and
scarlet
glass.

вЂњA
brothel,вЂќ
Bronn
said.
вЂњWhat
do
you
mean
to
do
here?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
does
one
usually
do
in
a
brothel?вЂќ

The
sellsword
laughed.
вЂњShaeвЂ™s
not
enough?вЂќ

вЂњShe
was
pretty
enough
for
a
camp
follower,
but
IвЂ™m
no
longer
in
camp.
Little
men
have
big
appetites,
and
IвЂ™m
told
the
girls
here
are
fit
for
a
king.вЂќ

вЂњIs
the
boy
old
enough?вЂќ

вЂњNot
Joffrey.
Robert.
This
house
was
a
great
favorite
of
his.вЂќ
Although
Joffrey
may
indeed
be
old
enough.
An
interesting
notion,
that.
вЂњIf
you
and
the
Black
Ears
care
to
amuse
yourselves,
feel
free,
but
ChatayaвЂ™s
girls
are
costly.
YouвЂ™ll
find
cheaper
houses
all
along
the
street.
Leave
one
man
here
whoвЂ™ll
know
where
to
find
the
others
when
I
wish
to
return.вЂќ

Bronn
nodded.
вЂњAs
you
say.вЂќ
The
Black
Ears
were
all
grins.

Inside
the
door,
a
tall
woman
in
flowing
silks
was
waiting
for
him.
She
had
ebon
skin
and
sandalwood
eyes.
вЂњI
am
Chataya,вЂќ
she
announced,
bowing
deeply.
вЂњAnd
you
areвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњLet
us
not
get
into
the
habit
of
names.
Names
are
dangerous.вЂќ
The
air
smelled
of
some
exotic
spice,
and
the
floor
beneath
his
feet
displayed
a
mosaic
of
two
women
entwined
in
love.
вЂњYou
have
a
pleasant
establishment.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
labored
long
to
make
it
so.
I
am
glad
the
Hand
is
pleased.вЂќ
Her
voice
was
flowing
amber,
liquid
with
the
accents
of
the
distant
Summer
Isles.

вЂњTitles
can
be
as
dangerous
as
names,вЂќ
Tyrion
warned.
вЂњShow
me
a
few
of
your
girls.вЂќ

вЂњIt
will
be
my
great
delight.
You
will
find
that
they
are
all
as
sweet
as
they
are
beautiful,
and
skilled
in
every
art
of
love.вЂќ
She
swept
off
gracefully,
leaving
Tyrion
to
waddle
after
as
best
he
could
on
legs
half
the
length
of
hers.

From
behind
an
ornate
Myrish
screen
carved
with
flowers
and
fancies
and
dreaming
maidens,
they
peered
unseen
into
a
common
room
where
an
old
man
was
playing
a
cheerful
air
on
the
pipes.
In
a
cushioned
alcove,
a
drunken
Tyroshi
with
a
purple
beard
dandled
a
buxom
young
wench
on
his
knee.
HeвЂ™d
unlaced
her
bodice
and
was
tilting
his
cup
to
pour
a
thin
trickle
of
wine
over
her
breasts
so
he
might
lap
it
off.
Two
other
girls
sat
playing
at
tiles
before
a
leaded
glass
window.
The
freckled
one
wore
a
chain
of
blue
flowers
in
her
honeyed
hair.
The
other
had
skin
as
smooth
and
black
as
polished
jet,
wide
dark
eyes,
small
pointed
breasts.
They
dressed
in
flowing
silks
cinched
at
the
waist
with
beaded
belts.
The
sunlight
pouring
through
the
colored
glass
outlined
their
sweet
young
bodies
through
the
thin
cloth,
and
Tyrion
felt
a
stirring
in
his
groin.
вЂњI
would
respectfully
suggest
the
dark-skinned
girl,вЂќ
said
Chataya.

вЂњSheвЂ™s
young.вЂќ

вЂњShe
has
sixteen
years,
my
lord.вЂќ

A
good
age
for
Joffrey,
he
thought,
remembering
what
Bronn
had
said.
His
first
had
been
even
younger.
Tyrion
remembered
how
shy
sheвЂ™d
seemed
as
he
drew
her
dress
up
over
her
head
the
first
time.
Long
dark
hair
and
blue
eyes
you
could
drown
in,
and
he
had.
So
long
agoвЂ¦
What
a
wretched
fool
you
are,
dwarf.
вЂњDoes
she
come
from
your
home
lands,
this
girl?вЂќ

вЂњHer
blood
is
the
blood
of
summer,
my
lord,
but
my
daughter
was
born
here
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing.вЂќ
His
surprise
must
have
shown
on
his
face,
for
Chataya
continued,
вЂњMy
people
hold
that
there
is
no
shame
to
be
found
in
the
pillow
house.
In
the
Summer
Isles,
those
who
are
skilled
at
giving
pleasure
are
greatly
esteemed.
Many
highborn
youths
and
maidens
serve
for
a
few
years
after
their
flowerings,
to
honor
the
gods.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
do
the
gods
have
to
do
with
it?вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods
made
our
bodies
as
well
as
our
souls,
is
it
not
so?
They
give
us
voices,
so
we
might
worship
them
with
song.
They
give
us
hands,
so
we
might
build
them
temples.
And
they
give
us
desire,
so
we
might
mate
and
worship
them
in
that
way.вЂќ

вЂњRemind
me
to
tell
the
High
Septon,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњIf
I
could
pray
with
my
cock,
IвЂ™d
be
much
more
religious.вЂќ
He
waved
a
hand.
вЂњI
will
gladly
accept
your
suggestion.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
summon
my
daughter.
Come.вЂќ

The
girl
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs.
Taller
than
Shae,
though
not
so
tall
as
her
mother,
she
had
to
kneel
before
Tyrion
could
kiss
her.
вЂњMy
name
is
Alayaya,вЂќ
she
said,
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
her
motherвЂ™s
accent.
вЂњCome,
my
lord.вЂќ
She
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
up
two
flights
of
stairs,
then
down
a
long
hall.
Gasps
and
shrieks
of
pleasure
were
coming
from
behind
one
of
the
closed
doors,
giggles
and
whispers
from
another.
TyrionвЂ™s
cock
pressed
against
the
lacings
of
his
breeches.
This
could
be
humiliating,
he
thought
as
he
followed
Alayaya
up
another
stair
to
the
turret
room.
There
was
only
one
door.
She
led
him
through
and
closed
it.
Within
the
room
was
a
great
canopied
bed,
a
tall
wardrobe
decorated
with
erotic
carvings,
and
a
narrow
window
of
leaded
glass
in
a
pattern
of
red
and
yellow
diamonds.

вЂњYou
are
very
beautiful,
Alayaya,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
her
when
they
were
alone.
вЂњFrom
head
to
heels,
every
part
of
you
is
lovely.
Yet
just
now
the
part
that
interests
me
most
is
your
tongue.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord
will
find
my
tongue
well
schooled.
When
I
was
a
girl
I
learned
when
to
use
it,
and
when
not.вЂќ

вЂњThat
pleases
me.вЂќ
Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњSo
what
shall
we
do
now?
Perchance
you
have
some
suggestion?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњIf
my
lord
will
open
the
wardrobe,
he
will
find
what
he
seeks.вЂќ

Tyrion
kissed
her
hand,
and
climbed
inside
the
empty
wardrobe.
Alayaya
closed
it
after
him.
He
groped
for
the
back
panel,
felt
it
slide
under
his
fingers,
and
pushed
it
all
the
way
aside.
The
hollow
space
behind
the
walls
was
pitch-black,
but
he
fumbled
until
he
felt
metal.
His
hand
closed
around
the
rung
of
a
ladder.
He
found
a
lower
rung
with
his
foot,
and
started
down.
Well
below
street
level,
the
shaft
opened
onto
a
slanting
earthen
tunnel,
where
he
found
Varys
waiting
with
candle
in
hand.

Varys
did
not
look
at
all
like
himself.
A
scarred
face
and
a
stubble
of
dark
beard
showed
under
his
spiked
steel
cap,
and
he
wore
mail
over
boiled
leather,
dirk
and
shortsword
at
his
belt.
вЂњWas
ChatayaвЂ™s
to
your
satisfaction,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњAlmost
too
much
so,вЂќ
admitted
Tyrion.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
certain
this
woman
can
be
relied
on?вЂќ

вЂњI
am
certain
of
nothing
in
this
fickle
and
treacherous
world,
my
lord.
Chataya
has
no
cause
to
love
the
queen,
though,
and
she
knows
that
she
has
you
to
thank
for
ridding
her
of
Allar
Deem.
Shall
we
go?вЂќ
He
started
down
the
tunnel.

Even
his
walk
is
different,
Tyrion
observed.
The
scent
of
sour
wine
and
garlic
clung
to
Varys
instead
of
lavender.
вЂњI
like
this
new
garb
of
yours,вЂќ
he
offered
as
they
went.

вЂњThe
work
I
do
does
not
permit
me
to
travel
the
streets
amid
a
column
of
knights.
So
when
I
leave
the
castle,
I
adopt
more
suitable
guises,
and
thus
live
to
serve
you
longer.вЂќ

вЂњLeather
becomes
you.
You
ought
to
come
like
this
to
our
next
council
session.вЂќ

вЂњYour
sister
would
not
approve,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњMy
sister
would
soil
her
smallclothes.вЂќ
He
smiled
in
the
dark.
вЂњI
saw
no
signs
of
any
of
her
spies
skulking
after
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
pleased
to
hear
it,
my
lord.
Some
of
your
sisterвЂ™s
hirelings
are
mine
as
well,
unbeknownst
to
her.
I
should
hate
to
think
they
had
grown
so
sloppy
as
to
be
seen.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
IвЂ™d
hate
to
think
I
was
climbing
through
wardrobes
and
suffering
the
pangs
of
frustrated
lust
all
for
naught.вЂќ

вЂњScarcely
for
naught,вЂќ
Varys
assured
him.
вЂњThey
know
you
are
here.
Whether
any
will
be
bold
enough
to
enter
ChatayaвЂ™s
in
the
guise
of
patrons
I
cannot
say,
but
I
find
it
best
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution.вЂќ

вЂњHow
is
it
a
brothel
happens
to
have
a
secret
entrance?вЂќ

вЂњThe
tunnel
was
dug
for
another
KingвЂ™s
Hand,
whose
honor
would
not
allow
him
to
enter
such
a
house
openly.
Chataya
has
closely
guarded
the
knowledge
of
its
existence.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
yet
you
knew
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњLittle
birds
fly
through
many
a
dark
tunnel.
Careful,
the
steps
are
steep.вЂќ

They
emerged
through
a
trap
at
the
back
of
a
stable,
having
come
perhaps
a
distance
of
three
blocks
under
RhaenysвЂ™s
Hill.
A
horse
whickered
in
his
stall
when
Tyrion
let
the
door
slam
shut.
Varys
blew
out
the
candle
and
set
it
on
a
beam
and
Tyrion
gazed
about.
A
mule
and
three
horses
occupied
the
stalls.
He
waddled
over
to
the
piebald
gelding
and
took
a
look
at
his
teeth.
вЂњOld,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњand
I
have
my
doubts
about
his
wind.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
not
a
mount
to
carry
you
into
battle,
true,вЂќ
Varys
replied,
вЂњbut
he
will
serve,
and
attract
no
notice.
As
will
the
others.
And
the
stableboys
see
and
hear
only
the
animals.вЂќ
The
eunuch
took
a
cloak
from
a
peg.
It
was
roughspun,
sun-faded,
and
threadbare,
but
very
ample
in
its
cut.
вЂњIf
you
will
permit
me.вЂќ
When
he
swept
it
over
TyrionвЂ™s
shoulders
it
enveloped
him
head
to
heel,
with
a
cowl
that
could
be
pulled
forward
to
drown
his
face
in
shadows.
вЂњMen
see
what
they
expect
to
see,вЂќ
Varys
said
as
he
fussed
and
pulled.
вЂњDwarfs
are
not
so
common
a
sight
as
children,
so
a
child
is
what
they
will
see.
A
boy
in
an
old
cloak
on
his
fatherвЂ™s
horse,
going
about
his
fatherвЂ™s
business.
Though
it
would
be
best
if
you
came
most
often
by
night.вЂќ

вЂњI
plan
toвЂ¦
after
today.
At
the
moment,
though,
Shae
awaits
me.вЂќ
He
had
put
her
up
in
a
walled
manse
at
the
far
northeast
corner
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
not
far
from
the
sea,
but
he
had
not
dared
visit
her
there
for
fear
of
being
followed.

вЂњWhich
horse
will
you
have?вЂќ

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњThis
one
will
do
well
enough.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
saddle
him
for
you.вЂќ
Varys
took
tack
and
saddle
down
from
a
peg.

Tyrion
adjusted
the
heavy
cloak
and
paced
restlessly.
вЂњYou
missed
a
lively
council.
Stannis
has
crowned
himself,
it
seems.вЂќ

вЂњI
know.вЂќ

вЂњHe
accuses
my
brother
and
sister
of
incest.
I
wonder
how
he
came
by
that
suspicion.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps
he
read
a
book
and
looked
at
the
color
of
a
bastardвЂ™s
hair,
as
Ned
Stark
did,
and
Jon
Arryn
before
him.
Or
perhaps
someone
whispered
it
in
his
ear.вЂќ
The
eunuchвЂ™s
laugh
was
not
his
usual
giggle,
but
deeper
and
more
throaty.

вЂњSomeone
like
you,
perchance?вЂќ

вЂњAm
I
suspected?
It
was
not
me.вЂќ

вЂњIf
it
had
been,
would
you
admit
it?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
But
why
should
I
betray
a
secret
I
have
kept
so
long?
It
is
one
thing
to
deceive
a
king,
and
quite
another
to
hide
from
the
cricket
in
the
rushes
and
the
little
bird
in
the
chimney.
Besides,
the
bastards
were
there
for
all
to
see.вЂќ

вЂњRobertвЂ™s
bastards?
What
of
them?вЂќ

вЂњHe
fathered
eight,
to
the
best
of
my
knowing,вЂќ
Varys
said
as
he
wrestled
with
the
saddle.
вЂњTheir
mothers
were
copper
and
honey,
chestnut
and
butter,
yet
the
babes
were
all
black
as
ravensвЂ¦
and
as
ill-omened,
it
would
seem.
So
when
Joffrey,
Myrcella,
and
Tommen
slid
out
between
your
sisterвЂ™s
thighs,
each
as
golden
as
the
sun,
the
truth
was
not
hard
to
glimpse.вЂќ

Tyrion
shook
his
head.
If
she
had
borne
only
one
child
for
her
husband,
it
would
have
been
enough
to
disarm
suspicionвЂ¦
but
then
she
would
not
have
been
Cersei.
вЂњIf
you
were
not
this
whisperer,
who
was?вЂќ

вЂњSome
traitor,
doubtless.вЂќ
Varys
tightened
the
cinch.

вЂњLittlefinger?вЂќ

вЂњI
named
no
name.вЂќ

Tyrion
let
the
eunuch
help
him
mount.
вЂњLord
Varys,вЂќ
he
said
from
the
saddle,
вЂњsometimes
I
feel
as
though
you
are
the
best
friend
I
have
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
and
sometimes
I
feel
you
are
my
worst
enemy.вЂќ

вЂњHow
odd.
I
think
quite
the
same
of
you.вЂќ





BRAN

Long
before
the
first
pale
fingers
of
light
pried
apart
BranвЂ™s
shutters,
his
eyes
were
open.

There
were
guests
in
Winterfell,
visitors
come
for
the
harvest
feast.
This
morning
they
would
be
tilting
at
quintains
in
the
yard.
Once
that
prospect
would
have
filled
him
with
excitement,
but
that
was
before.

Not
now.
The
Walders
would
break
lances
with
the
squires
of
Lord
ManderlyвЂ™s
escort,
but
Bran
would
have
no
part
of
it.
He
must
play
the
prince
in
his
fatherвЂ™s
solar.
вЂњListen,
and
it
may
be
that
you
will
learn
something
of
what
lordship
is
all
about,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
had
said.

Bran
had
never
asked
to
be
a
prince.
It
was
knighthood
he
had
always
dreamed
of;
bright
armor
and
streaming
banners,
lance
and
sword,
a
warhorse
between
his
legs.
Why
must
he
waste
his
days
listening
to
old
men
speak
of
things
he
only
half
understood?
Because
youвЂ™re
broken,
a
voice
inside
reminded
him.
A
lord
on
his
cushioned
chair
might
be
crippledвЂ”the
Walders
said
their
grandfather
was
so
feeble
he
had
to
be
carried
everywhere
in
a
litterвЂ”but
not
a
knight
on
his
destrier.
Besides,
it
was
his
duty.
вЂњYou
are
your
brotherвЂ™s
heir
and
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said,
reminding
him
of
how
Robb
used
to
sit
with
their
lord
father
when
his
bannermen
came
to
see
him.

Lord
Wyman
Manderly
had
arrived
from
White
Harbor
two
days
past,
traveling
by
barge
and
litter,
as
he
was
too
fat
to
sit
a
horse.
With
him
had
come
a
long
tail
of
retainers:
knights,
squires,
lesser
lords
and
ladies,
heralds,
musicians,
even
a
juggler,
all
aglitter
with
banners
and
surcoats
in
what
seemed
half
a
hundred
colors.
Bran
had
welcomed
them
to
Winterfell
from
his
fatherвЂ™s
high
stone
seat
with
the
direwolves
carved
into
the
arms,
and
afterward
Ser
Rodrik
had
said
heвЂ™d
done
well.
If
that
had
been
the
end
of
it,
he
would
not
have
minded.
But
it
was
only
the
beginning.

вЂњThe
feast
makes
a
pleasant
pretext,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
explained,
вЂњbut
a
man
does
not
cross
a
hundred
leagues
for
a
sliver
of
duck
and
a
sip
of
wine.
Only
those
who
have
matters
of
import
to
set
before
us
are
like
to
make
the
journey.вЂќ

Bran
gazed
up
at
the
rough
stone
ceiling
above
his
head.
Robb
would
tell
him
not
to
play
the
boy,
he
knew.
He
could
almost
hear
him,
and
their
lord
father
as
well.
Winter
is
coming,
and
you
are
almost
a
man
grown,
Bran.
You
have
a
duty.

When
Hodor
came
bustling
in,
smiling
and
humming
tunelessly,
he
found
the
boy
resigned
to
his
fate.
Together
they
got
him
washed
and
brushed.
вЂњThe
white
wool
doublet
today,вЂќ
Bran
commanded.
вЂњAnd
the
silver
brooch.
Ser
Rodrik
will
want
me
to
look
lordly.вЂќ
As
much
as
he
could,
Bran
preferred
to
dress
himself,
but
there
were
some
tasksвЂ”pulling
on
breeches,
lacing
his
bootsвЂ”that
vexed
him.
They
went
quicker
with
HodorвЂ™s
help.
Once
he
had
been
taught
to
do
something,
he
did
it
deftly.
His
hands
were
always
gentle,
though
his
strength
was
astonishing.
вЂњYou
could
have
been
a
knight
too,
I
bet,вЂќ
Bran
told
him.
вЂњIf
the
gods
hadnвЂ™t
taken
your
wits,
you
would
have
been
a
great
knight.вЂќ

вЂњHodor?вЂќ
Hodor
blinked
at
him
with
guileless
brown
eyes,
eyes
innocent
of
understanding.

вЂњYes,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњHodor.вЂќ
He
pointed.

On
the
wall
beside
the
door
hung
a
basket,
stoutly
made
of
wicker
and
leather,
with
holes
cut
for
BranвЂ™s
legs.
Hodor
slid
his
arms
through
the
straps
and
cinched
the
wide
belt
tight
around
his
chest,
then
knelt
beside
the
bed.
Bran
used
the
bars
sunk
into
the
wall
to
support
himself
as
he
swung
the
dead
weight
of
his
legs
into
the
basket
and
through
the
holes.

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
Hodor
said
again,
rising.
The
stableboy
stood
near
seven
feet
tall
all
by
himself;
on
his
back
BranвЂ™s
head
almost
brushed
the
ceiling.
He
ducked
low
as
they
passed
through
the
door.
One
time
Hodor
smelled
bread
baking
and
ran
to
the
kitchens,
and
Bran
got
such
a
crack
that
Maester
Luwin
had
to
sew
up
his
scalp.
Mikken
had
given
him
a
rusty
old
visorless
helm
from
the
armory,
but
Bran
seldom
troubled
to
wear
it.
The
Walders
laughed
whenever
they
saw
it
on
his
head.

He
rested
his
hands
on
HodorвЂ™s
shoulders
as
they
descended
the
winding
stair.
Outside,
the
sounds
of
sword
and
shield
and
horse
already
rang
through
the
yard.
It
made
a
sweet
music.
IвЂ™ll
just
have
a
look,
Bran
thought,
a
quick
look,
thatвЂ™s
all.

The
White
Harbor
lordlings
would
emerge
later
in
the
morning,
with
their
knights
and
men-at-arms.
Until
then,
the
yard
belonged
to
their
squires,
who
ranged
in
age
from
ten
to
forty.
Bran
wished
he
were
one
of
them
so
badly
that
his
stomach
hurt
with
the
wanting.

Two
quintains
had
been
erected
in
the
courtyard,
each
a
stout
post
supporting
a
spinning
crossbeam
with
a
shield
at
one
end
and
a
padded
butt
at
the
other.
The
shields
had
been
painted
red-and-gold,
though
the
Lannister
lions
were
lumpy
and
misshapen,
and
already
well
scarred
by
the
first
boys
to
take
a
tilt
at
them.

The
sight
of
Bran
in
his
basket
drew
stares
from
those
who
had
not
seen
it
before,
but
he
had
learned
to
ignore
stares.
At
least
he
had
a
good
view;
on
HodorвЂ™s
back,
he
towered
over
everyone.
The
Walders
were
mounting
up,
he
saw.
TheyвЂ™d
brought
fine
armor
up
from
the
Twins,
shining
silver
plate
with
enameled
blue
chasings.
Big
WalderвЂ™s
crest
was
shaped
like
a
castle,
while
Little
Walder
favored
streamers
of
blue
and
grey
silk.
Their
shields
and
surcoats
also
set
them
apart
from
each
other.
Little
Walder
quartered
the
twin
towers
of
Frey
with
the
brindled
boar
of
his
grandmotherвЂ™s
House
and
the
plowman
of
his
motherвЂ™s:
Crakehall
and
Darry,
respectively.
Big
WalderвЂ™s
quarterings
were
the
tree-and-ravens
of
House
Blackwood
and
the
twining
snakes
of
the
Paeges.
They
must
be
hungry
for
honor,
Bran
thought
as
he
watched
them
take
up
their
lances.
A
Stark
needs
only
the
direwolf.

Their
dappled
grey
coursers
were
swift,
strong,
and
beautifully
trained.
Side
by
side
they
charged
the
quintains.
Both
hit
the
shields
cleanly
and
were
well
past
before
the
padded
butts
came
spinning
around.
Little
Walder
struck
the
harder
blow,
but
Bran
thought
Big
Walder
sat
his
horse
better.
He
would
have
given
both
his
useless
legs
for
the
chance
to
ride
against
either.

Little
Walder
cast
his
splintered
lance
aside,
spied
Bran,
and
reined
up.
вЂњNow
thereвЂ™s
an
ugly
horse,вЂќ
he
said
of
Hodor.

вЂњHodorвЂ™s
no
horse,вЂќ
Bran
said.

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
said
Hodor.

Big
Walder
trotted
up
to
join
his
cousin.
вЂњWell,
heвЂ™s
not
as
smart
as
a
horse,
thatвЂ™s
for
certain.вЂќ
A
few
of
the
White
Harbor
lads
poked
each
other
and
laughed.

вЂњHodor.вЂќ
Beaming
genially,
Hodor
looked
from
one
Frey
to
the
other,
oblivious
to
their
taunting.
вЂњHodor
hodor?вЂќ

Little
WalderвЂ™s
mount
whickered.
вЂњSee,
theyвЂ™re
talking
to
each
other.
Maybe
hodor
means
вЂI
love
youвЂ™
in
horse.вЂќ

вЂњYou
shut
up,
Frey.вЂќ
Bran
could
feel
his
color
rising.

Little
Walder
spurred
his
horse
closer,
giving
Hodor
a
bump
that
pushed
him
backward.
вЂњWhat
will
you
do
if
I
donвЂ™t?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™ll
set
his
wolf
on
you,
cousin,вЂќ
warned
Big
Walder.

вЂњLet
him.
I
always
wanted
a
wolfskin
cloak.вЂќ

вЂњSummer
would
tear
your
fat
head
off,вЂќ
Bran
said.

Little
Walder
banged
a
mailed
fist
against
his
breastplate.
вЂњDoes
your
wolf
have
steel
teeth,
to
bite
through
plate
and
mail?вЂќ

вЂњEnough!вЂќ
Maester
LuwinвЂ™s
voice
cracked
through
the
clangor
of
the
yard
as
loud
as
a
thunderclap.
How
much
he
had
overheard,
Bran
could
not
sayвЂ¦
but
it
was
enough
to
anger
him,
clearly.
вЂњThese
threats
are
unseemly,
and
IвЂ™ll
hear
no
more
of
them.
Is
this
how
you
behave
at
the
Twins,
Walder
Frey?вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
want
to.вЂќ
Atop
his
courser,
Little
Walder
gave
Luwin
a
sullen
glare,
as
if
to
say,
You
are
only
a
maester,
who
are
you
to
reproach
a
Frey
of
the
Crossing?

вЂњWell,
it
is
not
how
Lady
StarkвЂ™s
wards
ought
behave
at
Winterfell.
WhatвЂ™s
at
the
root
of
this?вЂќ
The
maester
looked
at
each
boy
in
turn.
вЂњOne
of
you
will
tell
me,
I
swear,
orвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWe
were
having
a
jape
with
Hodor,вЂќ
confessed
Big
Walder.
вЂњI
am
sorry
if
we
offended
Prince
Bran.
We
only
meant
to
be
amusing.вЂќ
He
at
least
had
the
grace
to
look
abashed.

Little
Walder
only
looked
peevish.
вЂњAnd
me,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
was
only
being
amusing
too.вЂќ

The
bald
spot
atop
the
maesterвЂ™s
head
had
turned
red,
Bran
could
see;
if
anything,
Luwin
was
more
angry
than
before.
вЂњA
good
lord
comforts
and
protects
the
weak
and
helpless,вЂќ
he
told
the
Freys.
вЂњI
will
not
have
you
making
Hodor
the
butt
of
cruel
jests,
do
you
hear
me?
HeвЂ™s
a
goodhearted
lad,
dutiful
and
obedient,
which
is
more
than
I
can
say
for
either
of
you.вЂќ
The
maester
wagged
a
finger
at
Little
Walder.
вЂњAnd
you
will
stay
out
of
the
godswood
and
away
from
those
wolves,
or
answer
for
it.вЂќ
Sleeves
flapping,
he
turned
on
his
heels,
stalked
off
a
few
paces,
and
glanced
back.
вЂњBran.
Come.
Lord
Wyman
awaits.вЂќ

вЂњHodor,
go
with
the
maester,вЂќ
Bran
commanded.

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
said
Hodor.
His
long
strides
caught
up
with
the
maesterвЂ™s
furiously
pumping
legs
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Keep.
Maester
Luwin
held
the
door
open,
and
Bran
hugged
HodorвЂ™s
neck
and
ducked
as
they
went
through.

вЂњThe
WaldersвЂ”вЂќ
he
began.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
hear
no
more
of
that,
itвЂ™s
done.вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
looked
worn-out
and
frayed.
вЂњYou
were
right
to
defend
Hodor,
but
you
should
never
have
been
there.
Ser
Rodrik
and
Lord
Wyman
have
broken
their
fast
already
while
they
waited
for
you.
Must
I
come
myself
to
fetch
you,
as
if
you
were
a
little
child?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Bran
said,
ashamed.
вЂњIвЂ™m
sorry.
I
only
wantedвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
know
what
you
wanted,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said,
more
gently.
вЂњWould
that
it
could
be,
Bran.
Do
you
have
any
questions
before
we
begin
this
audience?вЂќ

вЂњWill
we
talk
of
the
war?вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
talk
of
naught.вЂќ
The
sharpness
was
back
in
LuwinвЂ™s
voice.
вЂњYou
are
still
a
child
of
eightвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAlmost
nine!вЂќ

вЂњEight,вЂќ
the
maester
repeated
firmly.
вЂњSpeak
nothing
but
courtesies
unless
Ser
Rodrik
or
Lord
Wyman
puts
you
a
question.вЂќ

Bran
nodded.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
remember.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
say
nothing
to
Ser
Rodrik
of
what
passed
between
you
and
the
Frey
boys.вЂќ

вЂњThank
you.вЂќ

They
put
Bran
in
his
fatherвЂ™s
oak
chair
with
the
grey
velvet
cushions,
behind
a
long
plank-and-trestle
table.
Ser
Rodrik
sat
on
his
right
hand
and
Maester
Luwin
to
his
left,
armed
with
quills
and
inkpots
and
a
sheaf
of
blank
parchment
to
write
down
all
that
transpired.
Bran
ran
a
hand
across
the
rough
wood
of
the
table
and
begged
Lord
WymanвЂ™s
pardons
for
being
late.

вЂњWhy,
no
prince
is
ever
late,вЂќ
the
Lord
of
White
Harbor
responded
amiably.
вЂњThose
who
arrive
before
him
have
come
early,
thatвЂ™s
all.вЂќ
Wyman
Manderly
had
a
great
booming
laugh.
it
was
small
wonder
he
could
not
sit
a
saddle;
he
looked
as
if
he
outweighed
most
horses.
As
windy
as
he
was
vast,
he
began
by
asking
Winterfell
to
confirm
the
new
customs
officers
he
had
appointed
for
White
Harbor.
The
old
ones
had
been
holding
back
silver
for
KingвЂ™s
Landing
rather
than
paying
it
over
to
the
new
King
in
the
North.
вЂњKing
Robb
needs
his
own
coinage
as
well,вЂќ
he
declared,
вЂњand
White
Harbor
is
the
very
place
to
mint
it.вЂќ
He
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
matter,
as
it
please
the
king,
and
went
from
that
to
speak
of
how
he
had
strengthened
the
portвЂ™s
defenses,
detailing
the
cost
of
every
improvement.

In
addition
to
a
mint,
Lord
Manderly
also
proposed
to
build
Robb
a
warfleet.
вЂњWe
have
had
no
strength
at
sea
for
hundreds
of
years,
since
Brandon
the
Burner
put
the
torch
to
his
fatherвЂ™s
ships.
Grant
me
the
gold
and
within
the
year
I
will
float
you
sufficient
galleys
to
take
Dragonstone
and
KingвЂ™s
Landing
both.вЂќ

BranвЂ™s
interest
pricked
up
at
talk
of
warships.
No
one
asked
him,
but
he
thought
Lord
WymanвЂ™s
notion
a
splendid
one.
In
his
mindвЂ™s
eye
he
could
see
them
already.
He
wondered
if
a
cripple
had
ever
commanded
a
warship.
But
Ser
Rodrik
promised
only
to
send
the
proposal
on
to
Robb
for
his
consideration,
while
Maester
Luwin
scratched
at
the
parchment.

Midday
came
and
went.
Maester
Luwin
sent
Poxy
Tym
down
to
the
kitchens,
and
they
dined
in
the
solar
on
cheese,
capons,
and
brown
oatbread.
While
tearing
apart
a
bird
with
fat
fingers,
Lord
Wyman
made
polite
inquiry
after
Lady
Hornwood,
who
was
a
cousin
of
his.
вЂњShe
was
born
a
Manderly,
you
know.
Perhaps,
when
her
grief
has
run
its
course,
she
would
like
to
be
a
Manderly
again,
eh?вЂќ
He
took
a
bite
from
a
wing,
and
smiled
broadly.
вЂњAs
it
happens,
I
am
a
widower
these
past
eight
years.
Past
time
I
took
another
wife,
donвЂ™t
you
agree,
my
lords?
A
man
does
get
lonely.вЂќ
Tossing
the
bones
aside,
he
reached
for
a
leg.
вЂњOr
if
the
lady
fancies
a
younger
lad,
well,
my
son
Wendel
is
unwed
as
well.
He
is
off
south
guarding
Lady
Catelyn,
but
no
doubt
he
will
wish
to
take
a
bride
on
his
return.
A
valiant
boy,
and
jolly.
just
the
man
to
teach
her
to
laugh
again,
eh?вЂќ
He
wiped
a
bit
of
grease
off
his
chin
with
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic.

Bran
could
hear
the
distant
clash
of
arms
through
the
windows.
He
cared
nothing
about
marriages.
I
wish
I
was
down
in
the
yard.

His
lordship
waited
until
the
table
had
been
cleared
before
he
raised
the
matter
of
a
letter
he
had
received
from
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
who
held
his
elder
son,
Ser
Wylis,
taken
captive
on
the
Green
Fork.
вЂњHe
offers
him
back
to
me
without
ransom,
provided
I
withdraw
my
levies
from
His
Grace
and
vow
to
fight
no
more.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
refuse
him,
of
course,вЂќ
said
Ser
Rodrik.

вЂњHave
no
fear
on
that
count,вЂќ
the
lord
assured
them.
вЂњKing
Robb
has
no
more
loyal
servant
than
Wyman
Manderly.
I
would
be
loath
to
see
my
son
languish
at
Harrenhal
any
longer
than
he
must,
however.
That
is
an
ill
place.
Cursed,
they
say.
Not
that
I
am
the
sort
to
swallow
such
tales,
but
still,
there
it
is.
Look
at
whatвЂ™s
befallen
this
Janos
Slynt.
Raised
up
to
Lord
of
Harrenhal
by
the
queen,
and
cast
down
by
her
brother.
Shipped
off
to
the
Wall,
they
say.
I
pray
some
equitable
exchange
of
captives
can
be
arranged
before
too
very
long.
I
know
Wylis
would
not
want
to
sit
out
the
rest
of
the
war.
Gallant,
that
son
of
mine,
and
fierce
as
a
mastiff.вЂќ

BranвЂ™s
shoulders
were
stiff
from
sitting
in
the
same
chair
by
the
time
the
audience
drew
to
a
close.
And
that
night,
as
he
sat
to
supper,
a
horn
sounded
to
herald
the
arrival
of
another
guest.
Lady
Donella
Hornwood
brought
no
tail
of
knights
and
retainers;
only
herself,
and
six
tired
men-at-arms
with
a
moosehead
badge
on
their
dusty
orange
livery.
вЂњWe
are
very
sorry
for
all
you
have
suffered,
my
lady,вЂќ
Bran
said
when
she
came
before
him
to
speak
her
words
of
greetings.
Lord
Hornwood
had
been
killed
in
the
battle
on
the
Green
Fork,
their
only
son
cut
down
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
вЂњWinterfell
will
remember.вЂќ

вЂњThat
is
good
to
know.вЂќ
She
was
a
pale
husk
of
a
woman,
every
line
of
her
face
etched
with
grief.
вЂњI
am
very
weary,
my
lord.
If
I
might
have
leave
to
rest,
I
should
be
thankful.вЂќ

вЂњTo
be
sure,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said.
вЂњThere
is
time
enough
for
talk
on
the
morrow.вЂќ

When
the
morrow
came,
most
of
the
morning
was
given
over
to
talk
of
grains
and
greens
and
salting
meat.
Once
the
maesters
in
their
Citadel
had
proclaimed
the
first
of
autumn,
wise
men
put
away
a
portion
of
each
harvestвЂ¦
though
how
large
a
portion
was
a
matter
that
seemed
to
require
much
talk.
Lady
Hornwood
was
storing
a
fifth
of
her
harvest.
At
Maester
LuwinвЂ™s
suggestion,
she
vowed
to
increase
that
to
a
quarter.

вЂњBoltonвЂ™s
bastard
is
massing
men
at
the
Dreadfort,вЂќ
she
warned
them.
вЂњI
hope
he
means
to
take
them
south
to
join
his
father
at
the
Twins,
but
when
I
sent
to
ask
his
intent,
he
told
me
that
no
Bolton
would
be
questioned
by
a
woman.
As
if
he
were
trueborn
and
had
a
right
to
that
name.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Bolton
has
never
acknowledged
the
boy,
so
far
as
I
know,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said.
вЂњI
confess,
I
do
not
know
him.вЂќ

вЂњFew
do,вЂќ
she
replied.
вЂњHe
lived
with
his
mother
until
two
years
past,
when
young
Domeric
died
and
left
Bolton
without
an
heir.
That
was
when
he
brought
his
bastard
to
the
Dreadfort.
The
boy
is
a
sly
creature
by
all
accounts,
and
he
has
a
servant
who
is
almost
as
cruel
as
he
is.
Reek,
they
call
the
man.
ItвЂ™s
said
he
never
bathes.
They
hunt
together,
the
Bastard
and
this
Reek,
and
not
for
deer.
IвЂ™ve
heard
tales,
things
I
can
scarce
believe,
even
of
a
Bolton.
And
now
that
my
lord
husband
and
my
sweet
son
have
gone
to
the
gods,
the
Bastard
looks
at
my
lands
hungrily.вЂќ

Bran
wanted
to
give
the
lady
a
hundred
men
to
defend
her
rights,
but
Ser
Rodrik
only
said,
вЂњHe
may
look,
but
should
he
do
more
I
promise
you
there
will
be
dire
retribution.
You
will
be
safe
enough,
my
ladyвЂ¦
though
perhaps
in
time,
when
your
grief
is
passed,
you
may
find
it
prudent
to
wed
again.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
past
my
childbearing
years,
what
beauty
I
had
long
fled,вЂќ
she
replied
with
a
tired
half
smile,
вЂњyet
men
come
sniffing
after
me
as
they
never
did
when
I
was
a
maid.вЂќ

вЂњYou
do
not
look
favorably
on
these
suitors?вЂќ
asked
Luwin.

вЂњI
shall
wed
again
if
His
Grace
commands
it,вЂќ
Lady
Hornwood
replied,
вЂњbut
Mors
Crowfood
is
a
drunken
brute,
and
older
than
my
father.
As
for
my
noble
cousin
of
Manderly,
my
lordвЂ™s
bed
is
not
large
enough
to
hold
one
of
his
majesty,
and
I
am
surely
too
small
and
frail
to
lie
beneath
him.вЂќ

Bran
knew
that
men
slept
on
top
of
women
when
they
shared
a
bed.
Sleeping
under
Lord
Manderly
would
be
like
sleeping
under
a
fallen
horse,
he
imagined.
Ser
Rodrik
gave
the
widow
a
sympathetic
nod.
вЂњYou
will
have
other
suitors,
my
lady.
We
shall
try
and
find
you
a
prospect
more
to
your
taste.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps
you
need
not
look
very
far,
ser.вЂќ

After
she
had
taken
her
leave,
Maester
Luwin
smiled.
вЂњSer
Rodrik,
I
do
believe
my
lady
fancies
you.вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
uncomfortable.

вЂњShe
was
very
sad,вЂќ
said
Bran.

Ser
Rodrik
nodded.
вЂњSad
and
gentle,
and
not
at
all
uncomely
for
a
woman
of
her
years,
for
all
her
modesty.
Yet
a
danger
to
the
peace
of
your
brotherвЂ™s
realm
nonetheless.вЂќ

вЂњHer?вЂќ
Bran
said,
astonished.

Maester
Luwin
answered.
вЂњWith
no
direct
heir,
there
are
sure
to
be
many
claimants
contending
for
the
Hornwood
lands.
The
Tallharts,
Flints,
and
Karstarks
all
have
ties
to
House
Hornwood
through
the
female
line,
and
the
Glovers
are
fostering
Lord
HarysвЂ™s
bastard
at
Deepwood
Motte.
The
Dreadfort
has
no
claim
that
I
know,
but
the
lands
adjoin,
and
Roose
Bolton
is
not
one
to
overlook
such
a
chance.вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
вЂњIn
such
cases,
her
liege
lord
must
find
her
a
suitable
match.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
canвЂ™t
you
marry
her?вЂќ
Bran
asked.
вЂњYou
said
she
was
comely,
and
Beth
would
have
a
mother.вЂќ

The
old
knight
put
a
hand
on
BranвЂ™s
arm.
вЂњA
kindly
thought,
my
prince,
but
I
am
only
a
knight,
and
besides
too
old.
I
might
hold
her
lands
for
a
few
years,
but
as
soon
as
I
died
Lady
Hornwood
would
find
herself
back
in
the
same
mire,
and
BethвЂ™s
prospects
might
be
perilous
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњThen
let
Lord
HornwoodвЂ™s
bastard
be
the
heir,вЂќ
Bran
said,
thinking
of
his
half
brother
Jon.

Ser
Rodrik
said,
вЂњThat
would
please
the
Glovers,
and
perhaps
Lord
HornwoodвЂ™s
shade
as
well,
but
I
do
not
think
Lady
Hornwood
would
love
us.
The
boy
is
not
of
her
blood.вЂќ

вЂњStill,вЂќ
said
Maester
Luwin,
вЂњit
must
be
considered.
Lady
Donella
is
past
her
fertile
years,
as
she
said
herself.
If
not
the
bastard,
who?вЂќ

вЂњMay
I
be
excused?вЂќ
Bran
could
hear
the
squires
at
their
swordplay
in
the
yard
below,
the
ring
of
steel
on
steel.

вЂњAs
you
will,
my
prince,вЂќ
said
Ser
Rodrik.
вЂњYou
did
well.вЂќ
Bran
flushed
with
pleasure.
Being
a
lord
was
not
so
tedious
as
he
had
feared,
and
since
Lady
Hornwood
had
been
so
much
briefer
than
Lord
Manderly,
he
even
had
a
few
hours
of
daylight
left
to
visit
with
Summer.
He
liked
to
spend
time
with
his
wolf
every
day,
when
Ser
Rodrik
and
the
maester
allowed
it.

No
sooner
had
Hodor
entered
the
godswood
than
Summer
emerged
from
under
an
oak,
almost
as
if
he
had
known
they
were
coming.
Bran
glimpsed
a
lean
black
shape
watching
from
the
undergrowth
as
well.
вЂњShaggy,вЂќ
he
called.
вЂњHere,
Shaggydog.
To
me.вЂќ
But
RickonвЂ™s
wolf
vanished
as
swiftly
as
heвЂ™d
appeared.

Hodor
knew
BranвЂ™s
favorite
place,
so
he
took
him
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
beneath
the
great
spread
of
the
heart
tree,
where
Lord
Eddard
used
to
kneel
to
pray.
Ripples
were
running
across
the
surface
of
the
water
when
they
arrived,
making
the
reflection
of
the
weirwood
shimmer
and
dance.
There
was
no
wind,
though.
For
an
instant
Bran
was
baffled.

And
then
Osha
exploded
up
out
of
the
pool
with
a
great
splash,
so
sudden
that
even
Summer
leapt
back,
snarling.
Hodor
jumped
away,
wailing
вЂњHodor,
HodorвЂќ
in
dismay
until
Bran
patted
his
shoulder
to
soothe
his
fears.
вЂњHow
can
you
swim
in
there?вЂќ
he
asked
Osha.
вЂњIsnвЂ™t
it
cold?вЂќ

вЂњAs
a
babe
I
suckled
on
icicles,
boy.
I
like
the
cold.вЂќ
Osha
swam
to
the
rocks
and
rose
dripping.
She
was
naked,
her
skin
bumpy
with
gooseprickles.
Summer
crept
close
and
sniffed
at
her.
вЂњI
wanted
to
touch
the
bottom.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
knew
there
was
a
bottom.вЂќ

вЂњMight
be
there
isnвЂ™t.вЂќ
She
grinned.
вЂњWhat
are
you
staring
at,
boy?
Never
seen
a
woman
before?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
so.вЂќ
Bran
had
bathed
with
his
sisters
hundreds
of
times
and
heвЂ™d
seen
serving
women
in
the
hot
pools
too.
Osha
looked
different,
though,
hard
and
sharp
instead
of
soft
and
curvy.
Her
legs
were
all
sinew,
her
breasts
flat
as
two
empty
purses.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
got
a
lot
of
scars.вЂќ

вЂњEvery
one
hard
earned.вЂќ
She
picked
up
her
brown
shift,
shook
some
leaves
off
of
it,
and
pulled
it
down
over
her
head.

вЂњFighting
giants?вЂќ
Osha
claimed
there
were
still
giants
beyond
the
Wall.
One
day
maybe
IвЂ™ll
even
see
oneвЂ¦

вЂњFighting
men.вЂќ
She
belted
herself
with
a
length
of
rope.
вЂњBlack
crows,
oft
as
not.
Killed
me
one
too,вЂќ
she
said,
shaking
out
her
hair.
It
had
grown
since
sheвЂ™d
come
to
Winterfell,
well
down
past
her
ears.
She
looked
softer
than
the
woman
who
had
once
tried
to
rob
and
kill
him
in
the
wolfswood.
вЂњHeard
some
yattering
in
the
kitchen
today
about
you
and
them
Freys.вЂќ

вЂњWho?
What
did
they
say?вЂќ

She
gave
him
a
sour
grin.
вЂњThat
itвЂ™s
a
fool
boy
who
mocks
a
giant,
and
a
mad
world
when
a
cripple
has
to
defend
him.вЂќ

вЂњHodor
never
knew
they
were
mocking
him,вЂќ
Bran
said.
вЂњAnyhow
he
never
fights.вЂќ
He
remembered
once
when
he
was
little,
going
to
the
market
square
with
his
mother
and
Septa
Mordane.
They
brought
Hodor
to
carry
for
them,
but
he
had
wandered
away,
and
when
they
found
him
some
boys
had
him
backed
into
an
alley,
poking
him
with
sticks.
вЂњHodor!вЂќ
he
kept
shouting,
cringing
and
covering
himself,
but
he
had
never
raised
a
hand
against
his
tormentors.
вЂњSepton
Chayle
says
he
has
a
gentle
spirit.вЂќ

вЂњAye,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњand
hands
strong
enough
to
twist
a
manвЂ™s
head
off
his
shoulders,
if
he
takes
a
mind
to.
All
the
same,
he
better
watch
his
back
around
that
Walder.
Him
and
you
both.
The
big
one
they
call
little,
it
comes
to
me
heвЂ™s
well
named.
Big
outside,
little
inside,
and
mean
down
to
the
bones.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™d
never
dare
hurt
me.
HeвЂ™s
scared
of
Summer,
no
matter
what
he
says.вЂќ

вЂњThen
might
be
heвЂ™s
not
so
stupid
as
he
seems.вЂќ
Osha
was
always
wary
around
the
direwolves.
The
day
she
was
taken,
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
between
them
had
torn
three
wildlings
to
bloody
pieces.
вЂњOr
might
be
he
is.
And
that
tastes
of
trouble
too.вЂќ
She
tied
up
her
hair.
вЂњYou
have
more
of
them
wolf
dreams?вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
He
did
not
like
to
talk
about
the
dreams.

вЂњA
prince
should
lie
better
than
that.вЂќ
Osha
laughed.
вЂњWell,
your
dreams
are
your
business.
MineвЂ™s
in
the
kitchens,
and
IвЂ™d
best
be
getting
back
before
Gage
starts
to
shouting
and
waving
that
big
wooden
spoon
of
his.
By
your
leave,
my
prince.вЂќ

She
should
never
have
talked
about
the
wolf
dreams,
Bran
thought
as
Hodor
carried
him
up
the
steps
to
his
bedchamber.
He
fought
against
sleep
as
long
as
he
could,
but
in
the
end
it
took
him
as
it
always
did.
On
this
night
he
dreamed
of
the
weirwood.
it
was
looking
at
him
with
its
deep
red
eyes,
calling
to
him
with
its
twisted
wooden
mouth,
and
from
its
pale
branches
the
three-eyed
crow
came
flapping,
pecking
at
his
face
and
crying
his
name
in
a
voice
as
sharp
as
swords.

The
blast
of
horns
woke
him.
Bran
pushed
himself
onto
his
side,
grateful
for
the
reprieve.
He
heard
horses
and
boisterous
shouting.
More
guests
have
come,
and
half-drunk
by
the
noise
of
them.
Grasping
his
bars
he
pulled
himself
from
the
bed
and
over
to
the
window
seat.
On
their
banner
was
a
giant
in
shattered
chains
that
told
him
that
these
were
Umber
men,
down
from
the
northlands
beyond
the
Last
River.

The
next
day
two
of
them
came
together
to
audience;
the
GreatjonвЂ™s
uncles,
blustery
men
in
the
winter
of
their
days
with
beards
as
white
as
the
bearskin
cloaks
they
wore.
A
crow
had
once
taken
Mors
for
dead
and
pecked
out
his
eye,
so
he
wore
a
chunk
of
dragonglass
in
its
stead.
As
Old
Nan
told
the
tale,
heвЂ™d
grabbed
the
crow
in
his
fist
and
bitten
its
head
off,
so
they
named
him
Crowfood.
She
would
never
tell
Bran
why
his
gaunt
brother
Hother
was
called
Whoresbane.

No
sooner
had
they
been
seated
than
Mors
asked
for
leave
to
wed
Lady
Hornwood.
вЂњThe
GreatjonвЂ™s
the
Young
WolfвЂ™s
strong
right
hand,
all
know
that
to
be
true.
Who
better
to
protect
the
widowвЂ™s
lands
than
an
Umber,
and
what
Umber
better
than
me?вЂќ

вЂњLady
Donella
is
still
grieving,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said.

вЂњI
have
a
cure
for
grief
under
my
furs.вЂќ
Mors
laughed.
Ser
Rodrik
thanked
him
courteously
and
promised
to
bring
the
matter
before
the
lady
and
the
king.

Hother
wanted
ships.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
wildlings
stealing
down
from
the
north,
more
than
IвЂ™ve
ever
seen
before.
They
cross
the
Bay
of
Seals
in
little
boats
and
wash
up
on
our
shores.
The
crows
in
Eastwatch
are
too
few
to
stop
them,
and
they
go
to
ground
quick
as
weasels.
ItвЂ™s
longships
we
need,
aye,
and
strong
men
to
sail
them.
The
Greatjon
took
too
many.
Half
our
harvest
is
gone
to
seed
for
want
of
arms
to
swing
the
scythes.вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
pulled
at
his
whiskers.
вЂњYou
have
forests
of
tall
pine
and
old
oak.
Lord
Manderly
has
shipwrights
and
sailors
in
plenty.
Together
you
ought
to
be
able
to
float
enough
longships
to
guard
both
your
coasts.вЂќ

вЂњManderly?вЂќ
Mors
Umber
snorted.
вЂњThat
great
waddling
sack
of
suet?
His
own
people
mock
him
as
Lord
Lamprey,
IвЂ™ve
heard.
The
man
can
scarce
walk.
If
you
stuck
a
sword
in
his
belly,
ten
thousand
eels
would
wriggle
out.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
fat,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
admitted,
вЂњbut
he
is
not
stupid.
You
will
work
with
him,
or
the
king
will
know
the
reason
why.вЂќ
And
to
BranвЂ™s
astonishment,
the
truculent
Umbers
agreed
to
do
as
he
commanded,
though
not
without
grumbling.

While
they
were
sitting
at
audience,
the
Glover
men
arrived
from
Deepwood
Motte,
and
a
large
party
of
Tallharts
from
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square.
Galbart
and
Robett
Glover
had
left
Deepwood
in
the
hands
of
RobettвЂ™s
wife,
but
it
was
their
steward
who
came
to
Winterfell.
вЂњMy
lady
begs
that
you
excuse
her
absence.
Her
babes
are
still
too
young
for
such
a
journey,
and
she
was
loath
to
leave
them.вЂќ
Bran
soon
realized
that
it
was
the
steward,
not
Lady
Glover,
who
truly
ruled
at
Deepwood
Motte.
The
man
allowed
that
he
was
at
present
setting
aside
only
a
tenth
of
his
harvest.
A
hedge
wizard
had
told
him
there
would
be
a
bountiful
spirit
summer
before
the
cold
set
in,
he
claimed.
Maester
Luwin
had
a
number
of
choice
things
to
say
about
hedge
wizards.
Ser
Rodrik
commanded
the
man
to
set
aside
a
fifth,
and
questioned
the
steward
closely
about
Lord
HornwoodвЂ™s
bastard,
the
boy
Larence
Snow.
In
the
north,
all
highborn
bastards
took
the
surname
Snow.
This
lad
was
near
twelve,
and
the
steward
praised
his
wits
and
courage.

вЂњYour
notion
about
the
bastard
may
have
merit,
Bran,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said
after.
вЂњOne
day
you
will
be
a
good
lord
for
Winterfell,
I
think.вЂќ

вЂњNo
I
wonвЂ™t.вЂќ
Bran
knew
he
would
never
be
a
lord,
no
more
than
he
could
be
a
knight.
вЂњRobbвЂ™s
to
marry
some
Frey
girl,
you
told
me
so
yourself,
and
the
Walders
say
the
same.
HeвЂ™ll
have
sons,
and
theyвЂ™ll
be
the
lords
of
Winterfell
after
him,
not
me.вЂќ

вЂњIt
may
be
so,
Bran,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said,
вЂњbut
I
was
wed
three
times
and
my
wives
gave
me
daughters.
Now
only
Beth
remains
to
me.
My
brother
Martyn
fathered
four
strong
sons,
yet
only
Jory
lived
to
be
a
man.
When
he
was
slain,
MartynвЂ™s
line
died
with
him.
When
we
speak
of
the
morrow
nothing
is
ever
certain.вЂќ

Leobald
Tallhart
had
his
turn
the
following
day.
He
spoke
of
weather
portents
and
the
slack
wits
of
smallfolk,
and
told
how
his
nephew
itched
for
battle.
вЂњBenfred
has
raised
his
own
company
of
lances.
Boys,
none
older
than
nineteen
years,
but
every
one
thinks
heвЂ™s
another
young
wolf.
When
I
told
them
they
were
only
young
rabbits,
they
laughed
at
me.
Now
they
call
themselves
the
Wild
Hares
and
gallop
about
the
country
with
rabbitskins
tied
to
the
ends
of
their
lances,
singing
songs
of
chivalry.вЂќ

Bran
thought
that
sounded
grand.
He
remembered
Benfred
Tallhart,
a
big
bluff
loud
boy
who
had
often
visited
Winterfell
with
his
father,
Ser
Helman,
and
had
been
friendly
with
Robb
and
with
Theon
Greyjoy.
But
Ser
Rodrik
was
clearly
displeased
by
what
he
heard.
вЂњIf
the
king
were
in
need
of
more
men,
he
would
send
for
them,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњInstruct
your
nephew
that
he
is
to
remain
at
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square,
as
his
lord
father
commanded.вЂќ

вЂњI
will,
ser,вЂќ
said
Leobald,
and
only
then
raised
the
matter
of
Lady
Hornwood.
Poor
thing,
with
no
husband
to
defend
her
lands
nor
son
to
inherit.
His
own
lady
wife
was
a
Hornwood,
sister
to
the
late
Lord
Halys,
doubtless
they
recalled.
вЂњAn
empty
hall
is
a
sad
one.
I
had
a
thought
to
send
my
younger
son
to
Lady
Donella
to
foster
as
her
own.
Beren
is
near
ten,
a
likely
lad,
and
her
own
nephew.
He
would
cheer
her,
I
am
certain,
and
perhaps
he
would
even
take
the
name
HornwoodвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњIf
he
were
named
heir?вЂќ
suggested
Maester
Luwin.

вЂњвЂ¦so
the
House
might
continue,вЂќ
finished
Leobald.

Bran
knew
what
to
say.
вЂњThank
you
for
the
notion,
my
lord,вЂќ
he
blurted
out
before
Ser
Rodrik
could
speak.
вЂњWe
will
bring
the
matter
to
my
brother
Robb.
Oh,
and
Lady
Hornwood.вЂќ

Leobald
seemed
surprised
that
he
had
spoken.
вЂњIвЂ™m
grateful,
my
prince,вЂќ
he
said,
but
Bran
saw
pity
in
his
pale
blue
eyes,
mingled
perhaps
with
a
little
gladness
that
the
cripple
was,
after
all,
not
his
son.
For
a
moment
he
hated
the
man.

Maester
Luwin
liked
him
better,
though.
вЂњBeren
Tallhart
may
well
be
our
best
answer,вЂќ
he
told
them
when
Leobald
had
gone.
вЂњBy
blood
he
is
half
Hornwood.
If
he
takes
his
uncleвЂ™s
nameвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦he
will
still
be
a
boy,вЂќ
said
Ser
Rodrik,
вЂњand
hard-pressed
to
hold
his
lands
against
the
likes
of
Mors
Umber
or
this
bastard
of
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s.
We
must
think
on
this
carefully.
Robb
should
have
our
best
counsel
before
he
makes
his
decision.вЂќ

вЂњIt
may
come
down
to
practicalities,вЂќ
said
Maester
Luwin.
вЂњWhich
lord
he
most
needs
to
court.
The
riverlands
are
part
of
his
realm,
he
may
wish
to
cement
the
alliance
by
wedding
Lady
Hornwood
to
one
of
the
lords
of
the
Trident.
A
Blackwood,
perhaps,
or
a
FreyвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњLady
Hornwood
can
have
one
of
our
Freys,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњShe
can
have
both
of
them
if
she
likes.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
not
kind,
my
prince,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
chided
gently.

Neither
are
the
Walders.
Scowling,
Bran
stared
down
at
the
table
and
said
nothing.

In
the
days
that
followed,
ravens
arrived
from
other
lordly
houses,
bearing
regrets.
The
bastard
of
the
Dreadfort
would
not
be
joining
them,
the
Mormonts
and
Karstarks
had
all
gone
south
with
Robb,
Lord
Locke
was
too
old
to
dare
the
journey,
Lady
Flint
was
heavy
with
child,
there
was
sickness
at
WidowвЂ™s
Watch.
Finally
all
of
the
principal
vassals
of
House
Stark
had
been
heard
from
save
for
Howland
Reed
the
crannogman,
who
had
not
set
foot
outside
his
swamps
for
many
a
year,
and
the
Cerwyns
whose
castle
lay
a
half
dayвЂ™s
ride
from
Winterfell.
Lord
Cerwyn
was
a
captive
of
the
Lannisters,
but
his
son,
a
lad
of
fourteen,
arrived
one
bright,
blustery
morning
at
the
head
of
two
dozen
lances.
Bran
was
riding
Dancer
around
the
yard
when
they
came
through
the
gate.
He
trotted
over
to
greet
them.
Cley
Cerwyn
had
always
been
a
friend
to
Bran
and
his
brothers.

вЂњGood
morrow,
Bran,вЂќ
Cley
called
out
cheerfully.
вЂњOr
must
I
call
you
Prince
Bran
now?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
if
you
want.вЂќ

Cley
laughed.
вЂњWhy
not?
Everyone
else
is
a
king
or
prince
these
days.
Did
Stannis
write
Winterfell
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњStannis?
I
donвЂ™t
know.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
a
king
now
too,вЂќ
Cley
confided.
вЂњHe
says
Queen
Cersei
bedded
her
brother,
so
Joffrey
is
a
bastard.вЂќ

вЂњJoffrey
the
Illborn,вЂќ
one
of
the
Cerwyn
knights
growled.
вЂњSmall
wonder
heвЂ™s
faithless,
with
the
Kingslayer
for
a
father.вЂќ

вЂњAye,вЂќ
said
another,
вЂњthe
gods
hate
incest.
Look
how
they
brought
down
the
Targaryens.вЂќ

For
a
moment
Bran
felt
as
though
he
could
not
breathe.
A
giant
hand
was
crushing
his
chest.
He
felt
as
though
he
was
falling,
and
clutched
desperately
at
DancerвЂ™s
reins.

His
terror
must
have
shown
on
his
face.
вЂњBran?вЂќ
Cley
Cerwyn
said.
вЂњAre
you
unwell?
ItвЂ™s
only
another
king.вЂќ

вЂњRobb
will
beat
him
too.вЂќ
He
turned
DancerвЂ™s
head
toward
the
stables,
oblivious
to
the
puzzled
stares
the
Cerwyns
gave
him.
His
blood
was
roaring
in
his
ears,
and
had
he
not
been
strapped
onto
his
saddle
he
might
well
have
fallen.

That
night
Bran
prayed
to
his
fatherвЂ™s
gods
for
dreamless
sleep.
If
the
gods
heard,
they
mocked
his
hopes,
for
the
nightmare
they
sent
was
worse
than
any
wolf
dream.

вЂњFly
or
die!вЂќ
cried
the
three-eyed
crow
as
it
pecked
at
him.
He
wept
and
pleaded
but
the
crow
had
no
pity.
It
put
out
his
left
eye
and
then
his
right,
and
when
he
was
blind
in
the
dark
it
pecked
at
his
brow,
driving
its
terrible
sharp
beak
deep
into
his
skull.
He
screamed
until
he
was
certain
his
lungs
must
burst.
The
pain
was
an
axe
splitting
his
head
apart,
but
when
the
crow
wrenched
out
its
beak
all
slimy
with
bits
of
bone
and
brain,
Bran
could
see
again.
What
he
saw
made
him
gasp
in
fear.
He
was
clinging
to
a
tower
miles
high,
and
his
fingers
were
slipping,
nails
scrabbling
at
the
stone,
his
legs
dragging
him
down,
stupid
useless
dead
legs.
вЂњHelp
me!вЂќ
he
cried.
A
golden
man
appeared
in
the
sky
above
him
and
pulled
him
up.
вЂњThe
things
I
do
for
love,вЂќ
he
murmured
softly
as
he
tossed
him
out
kicking
into
empty
air.





TYRION

вЂњI
do
not
sleep
as
I
did
when
I
was
younger,вЂќ
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
told
him,
by
way
of
apology
for
the
dawn
meeting.
вЂњI
would
sooner
be
up,
though
the
world
be
dark,
than
lie
restless
abed,
fretting
on
tasks
undone,вЂќ
he
saidвЂ”though
his
heavy-lidded
eyes
made
him
look
half-asleep
as
he
said
it.

In
the
airy
chambers
beneath
the
rookery,
his
girl
served
them
boiled
eggs,
stewed
plums,
and
porridge,
while
Pycelle
served
the
pontifications.
вЂњIn
these
sad
times,
when
so
many
hunger,
I
think
it
only
fitting
to
keep
my
table
spare.вЂќ

вЂњCommendable,вЂќ
Tyrion
admitted,
breaking
a
large
brown
egg
that
reminded
him
unduly
of
the
Grand
MaesterвЂ™s
bald
spotted
head.
вЂњI
take
a
different
view.
If
there
is
food
I
eat
it,
in
case
there
is
none
on
the
morrow.вЂќ
He
smiled.
вЂњTell
me,
are
your
ravens
early
risers
as
well?вЂќ

Pycelle
stroked
the
snowy
beard
that
flowed
down
his
chest.
вЂњTo
be
sure.
Shall
I
send
for
quill
and
ink
after
we
have
eaten?вЂќ

вЂњNo
need.вЂќ
Tyrion
laid
the
letters
on
the
table
beside
his
porridge,
twin
parchments
tightly
rolled
and
sealed
with
wax
at
both
ends.
вЂњSend
your
girl
away,
so
we
can
talk.вЂќ

вЂњLeave
us,
child,вЂќ
Pycelle
commanded.
The
serving
girl
hurried
from
the
room.
вЂњThese
letters,
nowвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњFor
the
eyes
of
Doran
Martell,
Prince
of
Dorne.вЂќ
Tyrion
peeled
the
cracked
shell
away
from
his
egg
and
took
a
bite.
It
wanted
salt.
вЂњOne
letter,
in
two
copies.
Send
your
swiftest
birds.
The
matter
is
of
great
import.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
dispatch
them
as
soon
as
we
have
broken
our
fast.вЂќ

вЂњDispatch
them
now.
Stewed
plums
will
keep.
The
realm
may
not.
Lord
Renly
is
leading
his
host
up
the
roseroad,
and
no
one
can
say
when
Lord
Stannis
will
sail
from
Dragonstone.вЂќ

Pycelle
blinked.
вЂњIf
my
lord
prefersвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHe
does.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
here
to
serve.вЂќ
The
maester
pushed
himself
ponderously
to
his
feet
his
chain
of
office
clinking
softly.
It
was
a
heavy
thing,
a
dozen
maesterвЂ™s
collars
threaded
around
and
through
each
other
and
ornamented
with
gemstones.
And
it
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
the
gold
and
silver
and
platinum
links
far
outnumbered
those
of
baser
metals.

Pycelle
moved
so
slowly
that
Tyrion
had
time
to
finish
his
egg
and
taste
the
plumsвЂ”overcooked
and
watery,
to
his
tasteвЂ”before
the
sound
of
wings
prompted
him
to
rise.
He
spied
the
raven,
dark
in
the
dawn
sky,
and
turned
briskly
toward
the
maze
of
shelves
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.

The
maesterвЂ™s
medicines
made
an
impressive
display;
dozens
of
pots
sealed
with
wax,
hundreds
of
stoppered
vials,
as
many
milkglass
bottles,
countless
jars
of
dried
herbs,
each
container
neatly
labeled
in
PycelleвЂ™s
precise
hand.
An
orderly
mind,
Tyrion
reflected,
and
indeed,
once
you
puzzled
out
the
arrangement,
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
potion
had
its
place.
And
such
interesting
things.
He
noted
sweetsleep
and
nightshade,
milk
of
the
poppy,
the
tears
of
Lys,
powdered
greycap,
wolfsbane
and
demonвЂ™s
dance,
basilisk
venom,
blindeye,
widowвЂ™s
bloodвЂ¦

Standing
on
his
toes
and
straining
upward,
he
managed
to
pull
a
small
dusty
bottle
off
the
high
shelf.
When
he
read
the
label,
he
smiled
and
slipped
it
up
his
sleeve.

He
was
back
at
the
table
peeling
another
egg
when
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
creeping
down
the
stairs.
вЂњIt
is
done,
my
lord.вЂќ
The
old
man
seated
himself.
вЂњA
matter
like
thisвЂ¦
best
done
promptly,
indeed,
indeedвЂ¦
of
great
import,
you
say?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
yes.вЂќ
The
porridge
was
too
thick,
Tyrion
felt,
and
wanted
butter
and
honey.
To
be
sure,
butter
and
honey
were
seldom
seen
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
of
late,
though
Lord
Gyles
kept
them
well
supplied
in
the
castle.
Half
of
the
food
they
ate
these
days
came
from
his
lands
or
Lady
TandaвЂ™s.
Rosby
and
Stokeworth
lay
near
the
city
to
the
north,
and
were
yet
untouched
by
war.

вЂњThe
Prince
of
Dorne,
himself.
Might
I
askвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњBest
not.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.вЂќ
PycelleвЂ™s
curiosity
was
so
ripe
that
Tyrion
could
almost
taste
it.
вЂњMayhapsвЂ¦
the
kingвЂ™s
councilвЂ¦вЂќ

Tyrion
tapped
his
wooden
spoon
against
the
edge
of
the
bowl.
вЂњThe
council
exists
to
advise
the
king,
Maester.вЂќ

вЂњJust
so,вЂќ
said
Pycelle,
вЂњand
the
kingвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”is
a
boy
of
thirteen.
I
speak
with
his
voice.вЂќ

вЂњSo
you
do.
Indeed.
The
KingвЂ™s
Own
Hand.
YetвЂ¦
your
most
gracious
sister,
our
Queen
Regent,
sheвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦bears
a
great
weight
upon
those
lovely
white
shoulders
of
hers.
I
have
no
wish
to
add
to
her
burdens.
Do
you?вЂќ
Tyrion
cocked
his
head
and
gave
the
Grand
Maester
an
inquiring
stare.

Pycelle
dropped
his
gaze
back
to
his
food.
Something
about
TyrionвЂ™s
mismatched
green-and-black
eyes
made
men
squirm;
knowing
that,
he
made
good
use
of
them.
вЂњAh,вЂќ
the
old
man
muttered
into
his
plums.
вЂњDoubtless
you
have
the
right
of
it,
my
lord.
It
is
most
considerate
of
you
toвЂ¦
spare
her
thisвЂ¦
burden.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
just
the
sort
of
fellow
I
am.вЂќ
Tyrion
returned
to
the
unsatisfactory
porridge.
вЂњConsiderate.
Cersei
is
my
own
sweet
sister,
after
all.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
woman,
to
be
sure,вЂќ
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
вЂњA
most
uncommon
woman,
and
yetвЂ¦
it
is
no
small
thing,
to
tend
to
all
the
cares
of
the
realm,
despite
the
frailty
of
her
sexвЂ¦вЂќ

Oh,
yes,
sheвЂ™s
a
frail
dove,
just
ask
Eddard
Stark.
вЂњIвЂ™m
pleased
you
share
my
concern.
And
I
thank
you
for
the
hospitality
of
your
table.
But
a
long
day
awaits.вЂќ
He
swung
his
legs
out
and
clambered
down
from
his
chair.
вЂњBe
so
good
as
to
inform
me
at
once
should
we
receive
a
reply
from
Dorne?
вЂњ

вЂњAs
you
say,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
only
me?вЂќ

вЂњAhвЂ¦
to
be
sure.вЂќ
PycelleвЂ™s
spotted
hand
was
clutching
at
his
beard
the
way
a
drowning
man
clutches
for
a
rope.
It
made
TyrionвЂ™s
heart
glad.
One,
he
thought.

He
waddled
out
into
the
lower
bailey;
his
stunted
legs
complained
of
the
steps.
The
sun
was
well
up
now,
and
the
castle
was
stirring.
Guardsmen
walked
the
walls,
and
knights
and
men-at-arms
were
training
with
blunted
weapons.
Nearby,
Bronn
sat
on
the
lip
of
a
well.
A
pair
of
comely
serving
girls
sauntered
past
carrying
a
wicker
basket
of
rushes
between
them,
but
the
sellsword
never
looked.
вЂњBronn,
I
despair
of
you.вЂќ
Tyrion
gestured
at
the
wenches.
вЂњWith
sweet
sights
like
that
before
you,
all
you
see
is
a
gaggle
of
louts
raising
a
clangor.вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
a
hundred
whorehouses
in
this
city
where
a
clipped
copper
will
buy
me
all
the
cunt
I
want,вЂќ
Bronn
answered,
вЂњbut
one
day
my
life
may
hang
on
how
close
IвЂ™ve
watched
your
louts.вЂќ
He
stood.
вЂњWhoвЂ™s
the
boy
in
the
checkered
blue
surcoat
with
the
three
eyes
on
his
shield?вЂќ

вЂњSome
hedge
knight.
Tallad,
he
names
himself.
Why?вЂќ

Bronn
pushed
a
fall
of
hair
from
his
eyes.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
the
best
of
them.
But
watch
him,
he
falls
into
a
rhythm,
delivering
the
same
strokes
in
the
same
order
each
time
he
attacks.вЂќ
He
grinned.
вЂњThat
will
be
the
death
of
him,
the
day
he
faces
me.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
pledged
to
Joffrey;
heвЂ™s
not
like
to
face
you.вЂќ
They
set
off
across
the
bailey,
Bronn
matching
his
long
stride
to
TyrionвЂ™s
short
one.
These
days
the
sellsword
was
looking
almost
respectable.
His
dark
hair
was
washed
and
brushed,
he
was
freshly
shaved,
and
he
wore
the
black
breastplate
of
an
officer
of
the
City
Watch.
From
his
shoulders
trailed
a
cloak
of
Lannister
crimson
patterned
with
golden
hands.
Tyrion
had
made
him
a
gift
of
it
when
he
named
him
captain
of
his
personal
guard.
вЂњHow
many
supplicants
do
we
have
today?вЂќ
he
inquired.

вЂњThirty
odd,вЂќ
answered
Bronn.
вЂњMost
with
complaints,
or
wanting
something,
as
ever.
Your
pet
was
back.вЂќ

He
groaned.
вЂњLady
Tanda?вЂќ

вЂњHer
page.
She
invites
you
to
sup
with
her
again.
ThereвЂ™s
to
be
a
haunch
of
venison,
she
says,
a
brace
of
stuffed
geese
sauced
with
mulberries,
andвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”her
daughter,вЂќ
Tyrion
finished
sourly.
Since
the
hour
he
had
arrived
in
the
Red
Keep,
Lady
Tanda
had
been
stalking
him,
armed
with
a
never-ending
arsenal
of
lamprey
pies,
wild
boars,
and
savory
cream
stews.
Somehow
she
had
gotten
the
notion
that
a
dwarf
lordling
would
be
the
perfect
consort
for
her
daughter
Lollys,
a
large,
soft,
dim-witted
girl
who
rumor
said
was
still
a
maid
at
thirty-and-three.
вЂњSend
her
my
regrets.вЂќ

вЂњNo
taste
for
stuffed
goose?вЂќ
Bronn
grinned
evilly.

вЂњPerhaps
you
should
eat
the
goose
and
marry
the
maid.
Or
better
still,
send
Shagga.вЂќ

вЂњShaggaвЂ™s
more
like
to
eat
the
maid
and
marry
the
goose,вЂќ
observed
Bronn.
вЂњAnyway,
Lollys
outweighs
him.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
that,вЂќ
Tyrion
admitted
as
they
passed
under
the
shadow
of
a
covered
walkway
between
two
towers.
вЂњWho
else
wants
me?вЂќ

The
sellsword
grew
more
serious.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
moneylender
from
Braavos,
holding
fancy
papers
and
the
like,
requests
to
see
the
king
about
payment
on
some
loan.вЂќ

вЂњAs
if
Joff
could
count
past
twenty.
Send
the
man
to
Littlefinger,
heвЂ™ll
find
a
way
to
put
him
off.
Next?вЂќ

вЂњA
lordling
down
from
the
Trident,
says
your
fatherвЂ™s
men
burned
his
keep,
raped
his
wife,
and
killed
all
his
peasants.вЂќ

вЂњI
believe
they
call
that
war.вЂќ
Tyrion
smelled
Gregor
CleganeвЂ™s
work,
or
that
of
Ser
Amory
Lorch
or
his
fatherвЂ™s
other
pet
hellhound,
the
Qohorik.
вЂњWhat
does
he
want
of
Joffrey?вЂќ

вЂњNew
peasants,вЂќ
Bronn
said.
вЂњHe
walked
all
this
way
to
sing
how
loyal
he
is
and
beg
for
recompense.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
make
time
for
him
on
the
morrow.вЂќ
Whether
truly
loyal
or
merely
desperate,
a
compliant
river
lord
might
have
his
uses.
вЂњSee
that
heвЂ™s
given
a
comfortable
chamber
and
a
hot
meal.
Send
him
a
new
pair
of
boots
as
well,
good
ones,
courtesy
of
King
Joffrey.вЂќ
A
show
of
generosity
never
hurt.

Bronn
gave
a
curt
nod.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
also
a
great
gaggle
of
bakers,
butchers,
and
greengrocers
clamoring
to
be
heard.вЂќ

вЂњI
told
them
last
time,
I
have
nothing
to
give
them.вЂќ
Only
a
thin
trickle
of
food
was
coming
into
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
most
of
it
earmarked
for
castle
and
garrison.
Prices
had
risen
sickeningly
high
on
greens,
roots,
flour,
and
fruit,
and
Tyrion
did
not
want
to
think
about
what
sorts
of
flesh
might
be
going
into
the
kettles
of
the
pot-shops
down
in
Flea
Bottom.
Fish,
he
hoped.
They
still
had
the
river
and
the
seaвЂ¦
at
least
until
Lord
Stannis
sailed.

вЂњThey
want
protection.
Last
night
a
baker
was
roasted
in
his
own
oven.
The
mob
claimed
he
charged
too
much
for
bread.вЂќ

вЂњDid
he?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
not
apt
to
deny
it.вЂќ

вЂњThey
didnвЂ™t
eat
him,
did
they?вЂќ

вЂњNot
that
IвЂ™ve
heard.вЂќ

вЂњNext
time
they
will,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
grimly.
вЂњI
give
them
what
protection
I
can.
The
gold
cloaksвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThey
claim
there
were
gold
cloaks
in
the
mob,вЂќ
Bronn
said.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
demanding
to
speak
to
the
king
himself.вЂќ

вЂњFools.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
sent
them
off
with
regrets;
his
nephew
would
send
them
off
with
whips
and
spears.
He
was
half-tempted
to
allow
itвЂ¦
but
no,
he
dare
not.
Soon
or
late,
some
enemy
would
march
on
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
and
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
willing
traitors
within
the
city
walls.
вЂњTell
them
King
Joffrey
shares
their
fears
and
will
do
all
he
can
for
them.вЂќ

вЂњThey
want
bread,
not
promises.вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
give
them
bread
today,
on
the
morrow
IвЂ™ll
have
twice
as
many
at
the
gates.
Who
else?вЂќ

вЂњA
black
brother
down
from
the
Wall.
The
steward
says
he
brought
some
rotted
hand
in
a
jar.вЂќ

Tyrion
smiled
wanly.
вЂњIвЂ™m
surprised
no
one
ate
it.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
see
him.
ItвЂ™s
not
Yoren,
perchance?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
Some
knight.
Thorne.вЂќ

вЂњSer
Alliser
Thorne?вЂќ
Of
all
the
black
brothers
heвЂ™d
met
on
the
Wall,
Tyrion
Lannister
had
liked
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
the
least.
A
bitter,
mean-spirited
man
with
too
great
a
sense
of
his
own
worth.
вЂњCome
to
think
on
it,
I
donвЂ™t
believe
I
care
to
see
Ser
Alliser
just
now.
Find
him
a
snug
cell
where
no
one
has
changed
the
rushes
in
a
year,
and
let
his
hand
rot
a
little
more.вЂќ

Bronn
snorted
laughter
and
went
his
way,
while
Tyrion
struggled
up
the
serpentine
steps.
As
he
limped
across
the
outer
yard,
he
heard
the
portcullis
rattling
up.
His
sister
and
a
large
party
were
waiting
by
the
main
gate.

Mounted
on
her
white
palfrey,
Cersei
towered
high
above
him,
a
goddess
in
green.
вЂњBrother,вЂќ
she
called
out,
not
warmly.
The
queen
had
not
been
pleased
by
the
way
heвЂ™d
dealt
with
Janos
Slynt.

вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
Tyrion
bowed
politely.
вЂњYou
look
lovely
this
morning.вЂќ
Her
crown
was
gold,
her
cloak
ermine.
Her
retinue
sat
their
mounts
behind
her:
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard,
wearing
white
scale
and
his
favorite
scowl;
Ser
Balon
Swann,
bow
slung
from
his
silver-inlay
saddle;
Lord
Gyles
Rosby,
his
wheezing
cough
worse
than
ever;
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
of
the
AlchemistsвЂ™
Guild;
and
the
queenвЂ™s
newest
favorite,
their
cousin
Ser
Lancel
Lannister,
her
late
husbandвЂ™s
squire
upjumped
to
knight
at
his
widowвЂ™s
insistence.
Vylarr
and
twenty
guardsmen
rode
escort.
вЂњWhere
are
you
bound
this
day,
sister?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked.

вЂњIвЂ™m
making
a
round
of
the
gates
to
inspect
the
new
scorpions
and
spitfires.
I
would
not
have
it
thought
that
all
of
us
are
as
indifferent
to
the
cityвЂ™s
defense
as
you
seem
to
be.вЂќ
Cersei
fixed
him
with
those
clear
green
eyes
of
hers,
beautiful
even
in
their
contempt.
вЂњI
am
informed
that
Renly
Baratheon
has
marched
from
Highgarden.
He
is
making
his
way
up
the
roseroad,
with
all
his
strength
behind
him.вЂќ

вЂњVarys
gave
me
the
same
report.вЂќ

вЂњHe
could
be
here
by
the
full
moon.вЂќ

вЂњNot
at
his
present
leisurely
pace,вЂќ
Tyrion
assured
her.
вЂњHe
feasts
every
night
in
a
different
castle,
and
holds
court
at
every
crossroads
he
passes.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
every
day,
more
men
rally
to
his
banners.
His
host
is
now
said
to
be
a
hundred
thousand
strong.вЂќ

вЂњThat
seems
rather
high.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has
the
power
of
StormвЂ™s
End
and
Highgarden
behind
him,
you
little
fool,вЂќ
Cersei
snapped
down
at
him.
вЂњAll
the
Tyrell
bannermen
but
for
the
Redwynes,
and
you
have
me
to
thank
for
that.
So
long
as
I
hold
those
poxy
twins
of
his,
Lord
Paxter
will
squat
on
the
Arbor
and
count
himself
fortunate
to
be
out
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњA
pity
you
let
the
Knight
of
Flowers
slip
through
your
pretty
fingers.
Still,
Renly
has
other
concerns
besides
us.
Our
father
at
Harrenhal,
Robb
Stark
at
RiverrunвЂ¦
were
I
he,
I
would
do
much
as
he
is
doing.
Make
my
progress,
flaunt
my
power
for
the
realm
to
see,
watch,
wait.
Let
my
rivals
contend
while
I
bide
my
own
sweet
time.
If
Stark
defeats
us,
the
south
will
fall
into
RenlyвЂ™s
hands
like
a
windfall
from
the
gods,
and
heвЂ™ll
not
have
lost
a
man.
And
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
he
can
descend
on
us
while
we
are
weakened.вЂќ

Cersei
was
not
appeased.
вЂњI
want
you
to
make
Father
bring
his
army
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing.вЂќ

Where
it
will
serve
no
purpose
but
to
make
you
feel
safe.
вЂњWhen
have
I
ever
been
able
to
make
Father
do
anything?вЂќ

She
ignored
the
question.
вЂњAnd
when
do
you
plan
to
free
Jaime?
HeвЂ™s
worth
a
hundred
of
you.вЂќ

Tyrion
grinned
crookedly.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
tell
Lady
Stark,
I
beg
you.
We
donвЂ™t
have
a
hundred
of
me
to
trade.вЂќ

вЂњFather
must
have
been
mad
to
send
you.
YouвЂ™re
worse
than
useless.вЂќ
The
queen
jerked
on
her
reins
and
wheeled
her
palfrey
around.
She
rode
out
the
gate
at
a
brisk
trot,
ermine
cloak
streaming
behind
her.
Her
retinue
hastened
after.

In
truth,
Renly
Baratheon
did
not
frighten
Tyrion
half
so
much
as
his
brother
Stannis
did.
Renly
was
beloved
of
the
commons,
but
he
had
never
before
led
men
in
war.
Stannis
was
otherwise:
hard,
cold,
inexorable.
if
only
they
had
some
way
of
knowing
what
was
happening
on
DragonstoneвЂ¦
but
not
one
of
the
fisherfolk
he
had
paid
to
spy
out
the
island
had
ever
returned,
and
even
the
informers
the
eunuch
claimed
to
have
placed
in
StannisвЂ™s
household
had
been
ominously
silent.
The
striped
hulls
of
Lysene
war
galleys
had
been
seen
offshore,
though,
and
Varys
had
reports
from
Myr
of
sellsail
captains
taking
service
with
Dragonstone.
If
Stannis
attacks
by
sea
while
his
brother
Renly
storms
the
gates,
theyвЂ™ll
soon
be
mounting
JoffreyвЂ™s
head
on
a
spike.
Worse,
mine
will
be
beside
him.
A
depressing
thought.
He
ought
to
make
plans
to
get
Shae
safely
out
of
the
city,
should
the
worst
seem
likely.

Podrick
Payne
stood
at
the
door
of
his
solar,
studying
the
floor.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
inside,вЂќ
he
announced
to
TyrionвЂ™s
belt
buckle.
вЂњYour
solar.
My
lord.
Sorry.вЂќ

Tyrion
sighed.
вЂњLook
at
me,
Pod.
It
unnerves
me
when
you
talk
to
my
codpiece,
especially
when
IвЂ™m
not
wearing
one.
Who
is
inside
my
solar?вЂќ

вЂњLord
Littlefinger.вЂќ
Podrick
managed
a
quick
look
at
his
face,
then
hastily
dropped
his
eyes.
вЂњI
meant,
Lord
Petyr.
Lord
Baelish.
The
master
of
coin.
вЂњ

вЂњYou
make
him
sound
a
crowd.вЂќ
The
boy
hunched
down
as
if
struck,
making
Tyrion
feel
absurdly
guilty.

Lord
Petyr
was
seated
on
his
window
seat,
languid
and
elegant
in
a
plush
plum-colored
doublet
and
a
yellow
satin
cape,
one
gloved
hand
resting
on
his
knee.
вЂњThe
king
is
fighting
hares
with
a
crossbow,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњThe
hares
are
winning.
Come
see.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
to
stand
on
his
toes
to
get
a
look.
A
dead
hare
lay
on
the
ground
below;
another,
long
ears
twitching,
was
about
to
expire
from
the
bolt
in
his
side.
Spent
quarrels
lay
strewn
across
the
hard-packed
earth
like
straws
scattered
by
a
storm.
вЂњNow!вЂќ
Joff
shouted.
The
gamesman
released
the
hare
he
was
holding,
and
he
went
bounding
off.
Joffrey
jerked
the
trigger
on
the
crossbow.
The
bolt
missed
by
two
feet.
The
hare
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
twitched
his
nose
at
the
king.
Cursing,
Joff
spun
the
wheel
to
winch
back
his
string,
but
the
animal
was
gone
before
he
was
loaded.
вЂњAnother!вЂќ
The
gamesman
reached
into
the
hutch.
This
one
made
a
brown
streak
against
the
stones,
while
JoffreyвЂ™s
hurried
shot
almost
took
Ser
Preston
in
the
groin.

Littlefinger
turned
away.
вЂњBoy,
are
you
fond
of
potted
hare?вЂќ
he
asked
Podrick
Payne.

Pod
stared
at
the
visitorвЂ™s
boots,
lovely
things
of
red-dyed
leather
ornamented
with
black
scrollwork.
вЂњTo
eat,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњInvest
in
pots,вЂќ
Littlefinger
advised.
вЂњHares
will
soon
overrun
the
castle.
WeвЂ™ll
be
eating
hare
thrice
a
day.вЂќ

вЂњBetter
than
rats
on
a
skewer,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњPod,
leave
us.
Unless
Lord
Petyr
would
care
for
some
refreshment?вЂќ

вЂњThank
you,
but
no.вЂќ
Littlefinger
flashed
his
mocking
smile.
вЂњDrink
with
the
dwarf,
itвЂ™s
said,
and
you
wake
up
walking
the
Wall.
Black
brings
out
my
unhealthy
pallor.вЂќ

Have
no
fear,
my
lord,
Tyrion
thought,
itвЂ™s
not
the
Wall
I
have
in
mind
for
you.
He
seated
himself
in
a
high
chair
piled
with
cushions
and
said,
вЂњYou
look
very
elegant
today,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
wounded.
I
strive
to
look
elegant
every
day.вЂќ

вЂњIs
the
doublet
new?вЂќ

вЂњIt
is.
YouвЂ™re
most
observant.вЂќ

вЂњPlum
and
yellow.
Are
those
the
colors
of
your
House?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
But
a
man
gets
bored
wearing
the
same
colors
day
in
and
day
out,
or
so
IвЂ™ve
found.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
a
handsome
knife
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it?вЂќ
There
was
mischief
in
LittlefingerвЂ™s
eyes.
He
drew
the
knife
and
glanced
at
it
casually,
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before.
вЂњValyrian
steel,
and
a
dragonbone
hilt.
A
trifle
plain,
though.
ItвЂ™s
yours,
if
you
would
like
it.вЂќ

вЂњMine?вЂќ
Tyrion
gave
him
a
long
look.
вЂњNo.
I
think
not.
Never
mine.вЂќ
He
knows,
the
insolent
wretch.
He
knows
and
he
knows
that
I
know,
and
he
thinks
that
I
cannot
touch
him.

If
ever
truly
a
man
had
armored
himself
in
gold,
it
was
Petyr
Baelish,
not
Jaime
Lannister.
JaimeвЂ™s
famous
armor
was
but
gilded
steel,
but
Littlefinger,
ahвЂ¦
Tyrion
had
learned
a
few
things
about
sweet
Petyr,
to
his
growing
disquiet.

Ten
years
ago,
Jon
Arryn
had
given
him
a
minor
sinecure
in
customs,
where
Lord
Petyr
had
soon
distinguished
himself
by
bringing
in
three
times
as
much
as
any
of
the
kingвЂ™s
other
collectors.
King
Robert
had
been
a
prodigious
spender.
A
man
like
Petyr
Baelish,
who
had
a
gift
for
rubbing
two
golden
dragons
together
to
breed
a
third,
was
invaluable
to
his
Hand.
LittlefingerвЂ™s
rise
had
been
arrow-swift.
Within
three
years
of
his
coming
to
court,
he
was
master
of
coin
and
a
member
of
the
small
council,
and
today
the
crownвЂ™s
revenues
were
ten
times
what
they
had
been
under
his
beleaguered
predecessorвЂ¦
though
the
crownвЂ™s
debts
had
grown
vast
as
well.
A
master
juggler
was
Petyr
Baelish.

Oh,
he
was
clever.
He
did
not
simply
collect
the
gold
and
lock
it
in
a
treasure
vault,
no.
He
paid
the
kingвЂ™s
debts
in
promises,
and
put
the
kingвЂ™s
gold
to
work.
He
bought
wagons,
shops,
ships,
houses.
He
bought
grain
when
it
was
plentiful
and
sold
bread
when
it
was
scarce.
He
bought
wool
from
the
north
and
linen
from
the
south
and
lace
from
Lys,
stored
it,
moved
it,
dyed
it,
sold
it.
The
golden
dragons
bred
and
multiplied,
and
Littlefinger
lent
them
out
and
brought
them
home
with
hatchlings.

And
in
the
process,
he
moved
his
own
men
into
place.
The
Keepers
of
the
Keys
were
his,
all
four.
The
KingвЂ™s
Counter
and
the
KingвЂ™s
Scales
were
men
heвЂ™d
named.
The
officers
in
charge
of
all
three
mints.
Harbormasters,
tax
farmers,
customs
sergeants,
wool
factors,
toll
collectors,
pursers,
wine
factors;
nine
of
every
ten
belonged
to
Littlefinger.
They
were
men
of
middling
birth,
by
and
large;
merchantsвЂ™
sons,
lesser
lordlings,
sometimes
even
foreigners,
but
judging
from
their
results,
far
more
able
than
their
highborn
predecessors.

No
one
had
ever
thought
to
question
the
appointments,
and
why
should
they?
Littlefinger
was
no
threat
to
anyone.
A
clever,
smiling,
genial
man,
everyoneвЂ™s
friend,
always
able
to
find
whatever
gold
the
king
or
his
Hand
required,
and
yet
of
such
undistinguished
birth,
one
step
up
from
a
hedge
knight,
he
was
not
a
man
to
fear.
He
had
no
banners
to
call,
no
army
of
retainers,
no
great
stronghold,
no
holdings
to
speak
of,
no
prospects
of
a
great
marriage.

But
do
I
dare
touch
him?
Tyrion
wondered.
Even
if
he
is
a
traitor?
He
was
not
at
all
certain
he
could,
least
of
all
now,
while
the
war
raged.
Given
time,
he
could
replace
LittlefingerвЂ™s
men
with
his
own
in
key
positions,
butвЂ¦

A
shout
rang
up
from
the
yard.
вЂњAh,
His
Grace
has
killed
a
hare,вЂќ
Lord
Baelish
observed.

вЂњNo
doubt
a
slow
one,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњMy
lord,
you
were
fostered
at
Riverrun.
IвЂ™ve
heard
it
said
that
you
grew
close
to
the
Tullys.вЂќ

вЂњYou
might
say
so.
The
girls
especially.вЂќ

вЂњHow
close?вЂќ

вЂњI
had
their
maidenhoods.
Is
that
close
enough?вЂќ

The
lieвЂ”Tyrion
was
fairly
certain
it
was
a
lieвЂ”was
delivered
with
such
an
air
of
nonchalance
that
one
could
almost
believe
it.
Could
it
have
been
Catelyn
Stark
who
lied?
About
her
defloration,
and
the
dagger
as
well?
The
longer
he
lived,
the
more
Tyrion
realized
that
nothing
was
simple
and
little
was
true.
вЂњLord
HosterвЂ™s
daughters
do
not
love
me,вЂќ
he
confessed.
вЂњI
doubt
they
would
listen
to
any
proposal
I
might
make.
Yet
coming
from
you,
the
same
words
might
fall
more
sweetly
on
their
ears.
вЂњ

вЂњThat
would
depend
on
the
words.
If
you
mean
to
offer
Sansa
in
return
for
your
brother,
waste
someone
elseвЂ™s
time.
Joffrey
will
never
surrender
his
plaything,
and
Lady
Catelyn
is
not
so
great
a
fool
as
to
barter
the
Kingslayer
for
a
slip
of
a
girl.вЂќ

вЂњI
mean
to
have
Arya
as
well.
I
have
men
searching.вЂќ

вЂњSearching
is
not
finding.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
keep
that
in
mind,
my
lord.
In
any
case,
it
was
Lady
Lysa
I
hoped
you
might
sway.
For
her,
I
have
a
sweeter
offer.вЂќ

вЂњLysa
is
more
tractable
than
Catelyn,
trueвЂ¦
but
also
more
fearful,
and
I
understand
she
hates
you.вЂќ

вЂњShe
believes
she
has
good
reason.
When
I
was
her
guest
in
the
Eyrie,
she
insisted
that
Id
murdered
her
husband
and
was
not
inclined
to
listen
to
denials.вЂќ
He
leaned
forward.
вЂњIf
I
gave
her
Jon
ArrynвЂ™s
true
killer,
she
might
think
more
kindly
of
me.вЂќ

That
made
Littlefinger
sit
up.
вЂњTrue
killer?
I
confess,
you
make
me
curious.
Who
do
you
propose?вЂќ

It
was
TyrionвЂ™s
turn
to
smile.
вЂњGifts
I
give
my
friends,
freely.
Lysa
Arryn
would
need
to
understand
that.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
her
friendship
you
require,
or
her
swords?вЂќ

вЂњBoth.вЂќ

Littlefinger
stroked
the
neat
spike
of
his
beard.
вЂњLysa
has
woes
of
her
own.
Clansmen
raiding
out
of
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
in
greater
numbers
than
ever
beforeвЂ¦
and
better
armed.вЂќ

вЂњDistressing,вЂќ
said
Tyrion
Lannister,
who
had
armed
them.
вЂњI
could
help
her
with
that.
A
word
from
meвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
would
this
word
cost
her?вЂќ

вЂњI
want
Lady
Lysa
and
her
son
to
acclaim
Joffrey
as
king,
to
swear
fealty,
and
toвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”make
war
on
the
Starks
and
Tullys?вЂќ
Littlefinger
shook
his
head.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
the
roach
in
your
pudding,
Lannister.
Lysa
will
never
send
her
knights
against
Riverrun.вЂќ

вЂњNor
would
I
ask
it.
We
have
no
lack
of
enemies.
IвЂ™ll
use
her
power
to
oppose
Lord
Renly,
or
Lord
Stannis,
should
he
stir
from
Dragonstone.
In
return,
I
will
give
her
justice
for
Jon
Arryn
and
peace
in
the
Vale.
I
will
even
name
that
appalling
child
of
hers
Warden
of
the
East,
as
his
father
was
before
him.вЂќ
I
want
to
see
him
fly,
a
boyвЂ™s
voice
whispered
faintly
in
memory.
вЂњAnd
to
seal
the
bargain,
I
will
give
her
my
niece.вЂќ

He
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
look
of
genuine
surprise
in
Petyr
BaelishвЂ™s
grey-green
eyes.
вЂњMyrcella?вЂќ

вЂњWhen
she
comes
of
age,
she
can
wed
little
Lord
Robert.
Until
such
time,
sheвЂ™ll
be
Lady
LysaвЂ™s
ward
at
the
Eyrie.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
does
Her
Grace
the
queen
think
of
this
ploy?вЂќ
When
Tyrion
shrugged,
Littlefinger
burst
into
laughter.
вЂњI
thought
not.
YouвЂ™re
a
dangerous
little
man,
Lannister.
Yes,
I
could
sing
this
song
to
Lysa.вЂќ
Again
the
sly
smile,
the
mischief
in
his
glance.
вЂњIf
I
cared
to.вЂќ

Tyrion
nodded,
waiting,
knowing
Littlefinger
could
never
abide
a
long
silence.

вЂњSo,вЂќ
Lord
Petyr
continued
after
a
pause,
utterly
unabashed,
вЂњwhatвЂ™s
in
your
pot
for
me?вЂќ

вЂњHarrenhal.вЂќ

It
was
interesting
to
watch
his
face.
Lord
PetyrвЂ™s
father
had
been
the
smallest
of
small
lords,
his
grandfather
a
landless
hedge
knight;
by
birth,
he
held
no
more
than
a
few
stony
acres
on
the
windswept
shore
of
the
Fingers.
Harrenhal
was
one
of
the
richest
plums
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
its
lands
broad
and
rich
and
fertile,
its
great
castle
as
formidable
as
any
in
the
realmвЂ¦
and
so
large
as
to
dwarf
Riverrun,
where
Petyr
Baelish
had
been
fostered
by
House
Tully,
only
to
be
brusquely
expelled
when
he
dared
raise
his
sights
to
Lord
HosterвЂ™s
daughter.

Littlefinger
took
a
moment
to
adjust
the
drape
of
his
cape,
but
Tyrion
had
seen
the
flash
of
hunger
in
those
sly
catвЂ™s
eyes.
I
have
him,
he
knew.
вЂњHarrenhal
is
cursed,вЂќ
Lord
Petyr
said
after
a
moment,
trying
to
sound
bored.

вЂњThen
raze
it
to
the
ground
and
build
anew
to
suit
yourself.
YouвЂ™ll
have
no
lack
of
coin.
I
mean
to
make
you
liege
lord
of
the
Trident.
These
river
lords
have
proven
they
cannot
be
trusted.
Let
them
do
you
fealty
for
their
lands.вЂќ

вЂњEven
the
Tullys?вЂќ

вЂњIf
there
are
any
Tullys
left
when
we
are
done.вЂќ

Littlefinger
looked
like
a
boy
who
had
just
taken
a
furtive
bite
from
a
honeycomb.
He
was
trying
to
watch
for
bees,
but
the
honey
was
so
sweet.
вЂњHarrenhal
and
all
its
lands
and
incomes,вЂќ
he
mused.
вЂњWith
a
stroke,
youвЂ™d
make
me
one
of
the
greatest
lords
in
the
realm.
Not
that
IвЂ™m
ungrateful,
my
lord,
butвЂ”why?вЂќ

вЂњYou
served
my
sister
well
in
the
matter
of
the
succession.вЂќ

вЂњAs
did
Janos
Slynt.
On
whom
this
same
castle
of
Harrenhal
was
quite
recently
bestowedвЂ”only
to
be
snatched
away
when
he
was
no
longer
of
use.вЂќ

Tyrion
laughed.
вЂњYou
have
me,
my
lord.
What
can
I
say?
I
need
you
to
deliver
the
Lady
Lysa.
I
did
not
need
Janos
Slynt.вЂќ
He
gave
a
crooked
shrug.
вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
have
you
seated
in
Harrenhal
than
Renly
seated
on
the
Iron
Throne.
What
could
be
plainer?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
indeed.
You
realize
that
I
may
need
to
bed
Lysa
Arryn
again
to
get
her
consent
to
this
marriage?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
little
doubt
youвЂ™ll
be
equal
to
the
task.вЂќ

вЂњI
once
told
Ned
Stark
that
when
you
find
yourself
naked
with
an
ugly
woman,
the
only
thing
to
do
is
close
your
eyes
and
get
on
with
it.вЂќ
Littlefinger
steepled
his
fingers
and
gazed
into
TyrionвЂ™s
mismatched
eyes.
вЂњGive
me
a
fortnight
to
conclude
my
affairs
and
arrange
for
a
ship
to
carry
me
to
Gulltown.вЂќ

вЂњThat
will
do
nicely.вЂќ

His
guest
rose.
вЂњThis
has
been
quite
the
pleasant
morning,
Lannister.
And
profitableвЂ¦
for
both
of
us,
I
trust.вЂќ
He
bowed,
his
cape
a
swirl
of
yellow
as
he
strode
out
the
door.

Two,
thought
Tyrion.

He
went
up
to
his
bedchamber
to
await
Varys,
who
would
soon
be
making
an
appearance.
Evenfall,
he
guessed.
Perhaps
as
late
as
moonrise,
though
he
hoped
not.
He
hoped
to
visit
Shae
tonight.
He
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
Galt
of
the
Stone
Crows
informed
him
not
an
hour
later
that
the
powdered
man
was
at
his
door.
вЂњYou
are
a
cruel
man,
to
make
the
Grand
Maester
squirm
so,вЂќ
the
eunuch
scolded.
вЂњThe
man
cannot
abide
a
secret.вЂќ

вЂњIs
that
a
crow
I
hear,
calling
the
raven
black?
Or
would
you
sooner
not
hear
what
IвЂ™ve
proposed
to
Doran
Martell?вЂќ

Varys
giggled.
вЂњPerhaps
my
little
birds
have
told
me.вЂќ

вЂњHave
they,
indeed?вЂќ
He
wanted
to
hear
this.
вЂњGo
on.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Dornishmen
thus
far
have
held
aloof
from
these
wars.
Doran
Martell
has
called
his
banners,
but
no
more.
His
hatred
for
House
Lannister
is
well
known,
and
it
is
commonly
thought
he
will
join
Lord
Renly.
You
wish
to
dissuade
him.вЂќ

вЂњAll
this
is
obvious,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.

вЂњThe
only
puzzle
is
what
you
might
have
offered
for
his
allegiance.
The
prince
is
a
sentimental
man,
and
he
still
mourns
his
sister
Elia
and
her
sweet
babe.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
once
told
me
that
a
lord
never
lets
sentiment
get
in
the
way
of
ambitionвЂ¦
and
it
happens
we
have
an
empty
seat
on
the
small
council,
now
that
Lord
Janos
has
taken
the
black.вЂќ

вЂњA
council
seat
is
not
to
be
despised,вЂќ
Varys
admitted,
вЂњyet
will
it
be
enough
to
make
a
proud
man
forget
his
sisterвЂ™s
murder?вЂќ

вЂњWhy
forget?вЂќ
Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
promised
to
deliver
his
sisterвЂ™s
killers,
alive
or
dead,
as
he
prefers.
After
the
war
is
done,
to
be
sure.вЂќ

Varys
gave
him
a
shrewd
look.
вЂњMy
little
birds
tell
me
that
Princess
Elia
cried
aвЂ¦
certain
nameвЂ¦
when
they
came
for
her.вЂќ

вЂњIs
a
secret
still
a
secret
if
everyone
knows
it?вЂќ
In
Casterly
Rock,
it
was
common
knowledge
that
Gregor
Clegane
had
killed
Elia
and
her
babe.
They
said
he
had
raped
the
princess
with
her
sonвЂ™s
blood
and
brains
still
on
his
hands.

вЂњThis
secret
is
your
lord
fatherвЂ™s
sworn
man.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
that
fifty
thousand
Dornishmen
are
worth
one
rabid
dog.вЂќ

Varys
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
вЂњAnd
if
Prince
Doran
demands
the
blood
of
the
lord
who
gave
the
command
as
well
as
the
knight
who
did
the
deedвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњRobert
Baratheon
led
the
rebellion.
All
commands
came
from
him,
in
the
end.вЂќ

вЂњRobert
was
not
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.вЂќ

вЂњNeither
was
Doran
Martell.вЂќ

вЂњSo.
Blood
for
his
pride,
a
chair
for
his
ambition.
Gold
and
land,
that
goes
without
saying.
A
sweet
offerвЂ¦
yet
sweets
can
be
poisoned.
If
I
were
the
prince,
something
more
would
I
require
before
I
should
reach
for
this
honeycomb.
Some
token
of
good
faith,
some
sure
safeguard
against
betrayal.вЂќ
Varys
smiled
his
slimiest
smile.
вЂњWhich
one
will
you
give
him,
I
wonder?вЂќ

Tyrion
sighed.
вЂњYou
know,
donвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

вЂњSince
you
put
it
that
wayвЂ”yes.
Tommen.
You
could
scarcely
offer
Myrcella
to
Doran
Martell
and
Lysa
Arryn
both.вЂќ

вЂњRemind
me
never
to
play
these
guessing
games
with
you
again.
You
cheat.
вЂњ

вЂњPrince
Tommen
is
a
good
boy.вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
pry
him
away
from
Cersei
and
Joffrey
while
heвЂ™s
still
young,
he
may
even
grow
to
be
a
good
man.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
good
king?вЂќ

вЂњJoffrey
is
king.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Tommen
is
heir,
should
anything
ill
befall
His
Grace.
Tommen,
whose
nature
is
so
sweet,
and
notablyвЂ¦
tractable.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
a
suspicious
mind,
Varys.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
take
that
as
a
tribute,
my
lord.
In
any
case,
Prince
Doran
will
hardly
be
insensible
of
the
great
honor
you
do
him.
Very
deftly
done,
I
would
sayвЂ¦
but
for
one
small
flaw.вЂќ

The
dwarf
laughed.
вЂњNamed
Cersei?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
avails
statecraft
against
the
love
of
a
mother
for
the
sweet
fruit
of
her
womb?
Perhaps,
for
the
glory
of
her
House
and
the
safety
of
the
realm,
the
queen
might
be
persuaded
to
send
away
Tommen
or
Myrcella.
But
both
of
them?
Surely
not.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
Cersei
does
not
know
will
never
hurt
me.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
Her
Grace
were
to
discover
your
intentions
before
your
plans
are
ripe?вЂќ

вЂњWhy,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњthen
I
would
know
the
man
who
told
her
to
be
my
certain
enemy.вЂќ
And
when
Varys
giggled,
he
thought,
Three.





SANSA

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

The
words
were
the
same
on
the
hundredth
reading
as
theyвЂ™d
been
on
the
first,
when
Sansa
had
discovered
the
folded
sheet
of
parchment
beneath
her
pillow.
She
did
not
know
how
it
had
gotten
there
or
who
had
sent
it.
The
note
was
unsigned,
unsealed,
and
the
hand
unfamiliar.
She
crushed
the
parchment
to
her
chest
and
whispered
the
words
to
herself.
вЂњCome
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home,вЂќ
she
breathed,
ever
so
faintly.

What
could
it
mean?
Should
she
take
it
to
the
queen
to
prove
that
she
was
being
good?
Nervously,
she
rubbed
her
stomach.
The
angry
purple
bruise
Ser
Meryn
had
given
her
had
faded
to
an
ugly
yellow,
but
still
hurt.
His
fist
had
been
mailed
when
he
hit
her.
It
was
her
own
fault.
She
must
learn
to
hide
her
feelings
better,
so
as
not
to
anger
Joffrey.
When
she
heard
that
the
Imp
had
sent
Lord
Slynt
to
the
Wall,
she
had
forgotten
herself
and
said,
вЂњI
hope
the
Others
get
him.вЂќ
The
king
had
not
been
pleased.

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

Sansa
had
prayed
so
hard.
Could
this
be
her
answer
at
last,
a
true
knight
sent
to
save
her?
Perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
Redwyne
twins,
or
bold
Ser
Balon
SwannвЂ¦
or
even
Beric
Dondarrion,
the
young
lord
her
friend
Jeyne
Poole
had
loved,
with
his
red-gold
hair
and
the
spray
of
stars
on
his
black
cloak.

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

What
if
it
was
some
cruel
jape
of
JoffreyвЂ™s,
like
the
day
he
had
taken
her
up
to
the
battlements
to
show
her
FatherвЂ™s
head?
Or
perhaps
it
was
some
subtle
snare
to
prove
she
was
not
loyal.
If
she
went
to
the
godswood,
would
she
find
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
waiting
for
her,
sitting
silent
under
the
heart
tree
with
Ice
in
his
hand,
his
pale
eyes
watching
to
see
if
sheвЂ™d
come?

Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.

When
the
door
opened,
she
hurriedly
stuffed
the
note
under
her
sheet
and
sat
on
it.
It
was
her
bedmaid,
the
mousy
one
with
the
limp
brown
hair.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want?вЂќ
Sansa
demanded.

вЂњWill
milady
be
wanting
a
bath
tonight?вЂќ

вЂњA
fire,
I
thinkвЂ¦
I
feel
a
chill.вЂќ
She
was
shivering,
though
the
day
had
been
hot.

вЂњAs
you
wish.вЂќ

Sansa
watched
the
girl
suspiciously.
Had
she
seen
the
note?
Had
she
put
it
under
the
pillow?
It
did
not
seem
likely;
she
seemed
a
stupid
girl,
not
one
youвЂ™d
want
delivering
secret
notes,
but
Sansa
did
not
know
her.
The
queen
had
her
servants
changed
every
fortnight,
to
make
certain
none
of
them
befriended
her.

When
a
fire
was
blazing
in
the
hearth,
Sansa
thanked
the
maid
curtly
and
ordered
her
out.
The
girl
was
quick
to
obey,
as
ever,
but
Sansa
decided
there
was
something
sly
about
her
eyes.
Doubtless,
she
was
scurrying
off
to
report
to
the
queen,
or
maybe
Varys.
All
her
maids
spied
on
her,
she
was
certain.

Once
alone,
she
thrust
the
note
in
the
flames,
watching
the
parchment
curl
and
blacken.
Come
to
the
godswood
tonight,
if
you
want
to
go
home.
She
drifted
to
her
window.
Below,
she
could
see
a
short
knight
in
moon-pale
armor
and
a
heavy
white
cloak
pacing
the
drawbridge.
From
his
height,
it
could
only
be
Ser
Preston
Greenfield.
The
queen
had
given
her
freedom
of
the
castle,
but
even
so,
he
would
want
to
know
where
she
was
going
if
she
tried
to
leave
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast
at
this
time
of
night.
What
was
she
to
tell
him?
Suddenly
she
was
glad
she
had
burned
the
note.

She
unlaced
her
gown
and
crawled
into
her
bed,
but
she
did
not
sleep.
Was
he
still
there?
she
wondered.
How
long
will
he
wait?
It
was
so
cruel,
to
send
her
a
note
and
tell
her
nothing.
The
thoughts
went
round
and
round
in
her
head.

If
only
she
had
someone
to
tell
her
what
to
do.
She
missed
Septa
Mordane,
and
even
more
Jeyne
Poole,
her
truest
friend.
The
septa
had
lost
her
head
with
the
rest,
for
the
crime
of
serving
House
Stark.
Sansa
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
Jeyne,
who
had
disappeared
from
her
rooms
afterward,
never
to
be
mentioned
again.
She
tried
not
to
think
of
them
too
often,
yet
sometimes
the
memories
came
unbidden,
and
then
it
was
hard
to
hold
back
the
tears.
Once
in
a
while,
Sansa
even
missed
her
sister.
By
now
Arya
was
safe
back
in
Winterfell,
dancing
and
sewing,
playing
with
Bran
and
baby
Rickon,
even
riding
through
the
winter
town
if
she
liked.
Sansa
was
allowed
to
go
riding
too,
but
only
in
the
bailey,
and
it
got
boring
going
round
in
a
circle
all
day.

She
was
wide
awake
when
she
heard
the
shouting.
Distant
at
first,
then
growing
louder.
Many
voices
yelling
together.
She
could
not
make
out
the
words.
And
there
were
horses
as
well,
and
pounding
feet,
shouts
of
command.
She
crept
to
her
window
and
saw
men
running
on
the
walls,
carrying
spears
and
torches.
Go
back
to
your
bed,
Sansa
told
herself,
this
is
nothing
that
concerns
you,
just
some
new
trouble
out
in
the
city.
The
talk
at
the
wells
had
all
been
of
troubles
in
the
city
of
late.
People
were
crowding
in,
running
from
the
war,
and
many
had
no
way
to
live
save
by
robbing
and
killing
each
other.
Go
to
bed.

But
when
she
looked,
the
white
knight
was
gone,
the
bridge
across
the
dry
moat
down
but
undefended.

Sansa
turned
away
without
thinking
and
ran
to
her
wardrobe.
Oh,
what
am
I
doing?
she
asked
herself
as
she
dressed.
This
is
madness.
She
could
see
the
lights
of
many
torches
on
the
curtain
walls.
Had
Stannis
and
Renly
come
at
last
to
kill
Joffrey
and
claim
their
brotherвЂ™s
throne?
If
so,
the
guards
would
raise
the
drawbridge,
cutting
off
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast
from
the
outer
castle.
Sansa
threw
a
plain
grey
cloak
over
her
shoulders
and
picked
up
the
knife
she
used
to
cut
her
meat.
If
it
is
some
trap,
better
that
I
die
than
let
them
hurt
me
more,
she
told
herself.
She
hid
the
blade
under
her
cloak.

A
column
of
red-cloaked
swordsmen
ran
past
as
she
slipped
out
into
the
night.
She
waited
until
they
were
well
past
before
she
darted
across
the
undefended
drawbridge.
In
the
yard,
men
were
buckling
on
swordbelts
and
cinching
the
saddles
of
their
horses.
She
glimpsed
Ser
Preston
near
the
stables
with
three
others
of
the
Kingsguard,
white
cloaks
bright
as
the
moon
as
they
helped
Joffrey
into
his
armor.
Her
breath
caught
in
her
throat
when
she
saw
the
king.
Thankfully,
he
did
not
see
her.
He
was
shouting
for
his
sword
and
crossbow.

The
noise
receded
as
she
moved
deeper
into
the
castle,
never
daring
to
look
back
for
fear
that
Joffrey
might
be
watchingвЂ¦
or
worse,
following.
The
serpentine
steps
twisted
ahead,
striped
by
bars
of
flickering
light
from
the
narrow
windows
above.
Sansa
was
panting
by
the
time
she
reached
the
top.
She
ran
down
a
shadowy
colonnade
and
pressed
herself
against
a
wall
to
catch
her
breath.
When
something
brushed
against
her
leg,
she
almost
jumped
out
of
her
skin,
but
it
was
only
a
cat,
a
ragged
black
tom
with
a
chewed-off
ear.
The
creature
spit
at
her
and
leapt
away.

By
the
time
she
reached
the
godswood,
the
noises
had
faded
to
a
faint
rattle
of
steel
and
a
distant
shouting.
Sansa
pulled
her
cloak
tighter.
The
air
was
rich
with
the
smells
of
earth
and
leaf.
Lady
would
have
liked
this
place,
she
thought.
There
was
something
wild
about
a
godswood;
even
here,
in
the
heart
of
the
castle
at
the
heart
of
the
city,
you
could
feel
the
old
gods
watching
with
a
thousand
unseen
eyes.

Sansa
had
favored
her
motherвЂ™s
gods
over
her
fatherвЂ™s.
She
loved
the
statues,
the
pictures
in
leaded
glass,
the
fragrance
of
burning
incense,
the
septons
with
their
robes
and
crystals,
the
magical
play
of
the
rainbows
over
altars
inlaid
with
mother-of-pearl
and
onyx
and
lapis
lazuli.
Yet
she
could
not
deny
that
the
godswood
had
a
certain
power
too.
Especially
by
night.
Help
me,
she
prayed,
send
me
a
friend,
a
true
knight
to
champion
meвЂ¦

She
moved
from
tree
to
tree,
feeling
the
roughness
of
the
bark
beneath
her
fingers.
Leaves
brushed
at
her
cheeks.
Had
she
come
too
late?
He
would
not
have
left
so
soon,
would
he?
Or
had
he
even
been
here?
Dare
she
risk
calling
out?
It
seemed
so
hushed
and
still
hereвЂ¦

вЂњI
feared
you
would
not
come,
child.вЂќ

Sansa
whirled.
A
man
stepped
out
of
the
shadows,
heavyset,
thick
of
neck,
shambling.
He
wore
a
dark
grey
robe
with
the
cowl
pulled
forward,
but
when
a
thin
sliver
of
moonlight
touched
his
cheek,
she
knew
him
at
once
by
the
blotchy
skin
and
web
of
broken
veins
beneath.
вЂњSer
Dontos,вЂќ
she
breathed,
heartbroken.
вЂњWas
it
you?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lady.вЂќ
When
he
moved
closer,
she
could
smell
the
sour
stench
of
wine
on
his
breath.
вЂњMe.вЂќ
He
reached
out
a
hand.

Sansa
shrank
back.
вЂњDonвЂ™t!вЂќ
She
slid
her
hand
under
her
cloak,
to
her
hidden
knife.
вЂњWhatвЂ¦
what
do
you
want
with
me?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
to
help
you,вЂќ
Dontos
said,
вЂњas
you
helped
me.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
drunk,
arenвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
one
cup
of
wine,
to
help
my
courage.
If
they
catch
me
now,
theyвЂ™ll
strip
the
skin
off
my
back.вЂќ

And
what
will
they
do
to
me?
Sansa
found
herself
thinking
of
Lady
again.
She
could
smell
out
falsehood,
she
could,
but
she
was
dead,
Father
had
killed
her,
on
account
of
Arya.
She
drew
the
knife
and
held
it
before
her
with
both
hands.

вЂњAre
you
going
to
stab
me?вЂќ
Dontos
asked.

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњTell
me
who
sent
you.вЂќ

вЂњNo
one,
sweet
lady.
I
swear
it
on
my
honor
as
a
knight.вЂќ

вЂњA
knight?вЂќ
Joffrey
had
decreed
that
he
was
to
be
a
knight
no
longer,
only
a
fool,
lower
even
than
Moon
Boy.
вЂњI
prayed
to
the
gods
for
a
knight
to
come
save
me,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњI
prayed
and
prayed.
Why
would
they
send
me
a
drunken
old
fool?вЂќ

вЂњI
deserve
that,
thoughвЂ¦
I
know
itвЂ™s
queer,
butвЂ¦
all
those
years
I
was
a
knight,
I
was
truly
a
fool,
and
now
that
I
am
a
fool
I
thinkвЂ¦
I
think
I
may
find
it
in
me
to
be
a
knight
again,
sweet
lady.
And
all
because
of
youвЂ¦
your
grace,
your
courage.
You
saved
me,
not
only
from
Joffrey,
but
from
myself.вЂќ
His
voice
dropped.
вЂњThe
singers
say
there
was
another
fool
once
who
was
the
greatest
knight
of
allвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњFlorian,вЂќ
Sansa
whispered.
A
shiver
went
through
her.

вЂњSweet
lady,
I
would
be
your
Florian,вЂќ
Dontos
said
humbly,
falling
to
his
knees
before
her.

Slowly,
Sansa
lowered
the
knife.
Her
head
seemed
terribly
light,
as
if
she
were
floating.
This
is
madness,
to
trust
myself
to
this
drunkard,
but
if
I
turn
away
will
the
chance
ever
come
again?
вЂњHowвЂ¦
how
would
you
do
it?
Get
me
away?вЂќ

Ser
Dontos
raised
his
face
to
her.
вЂњTaking
you
from
the
castle,
that
will
be
the
hardest.
Once
youвЂ™re
out,
there
are
ships
that
would
take
you
home.
IвЂ™d
need
to
find
the
coin
and
make
the
arrangements,
thatвЂ™s
all.вЂќ

вЂњCould
we
go
now?вЂќ
she
asked,
hardly
daring
to
hope.

вЂњThis
very
night?
No,
my
lady,
I
fear
not.
First
I
must
find
a
sure
way
to
get
you
from
the
castle
when
the
hour
is
ripe.
It
will
not
be
easy,
nor
quick.
They
watch
me
as
well.вЂќ
He
licked
his
lips
nervously.
вЂњWill
you
put
away
your
blade?вЂќ

Sansa
slipped
the
knife
beneath
her
cloak.
вЂњRise,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњThank
you,
sweet
lady.вЂќ
Ser
Dontos
lurched
clumsily
to
his
feet,
and
brushed
earth
and
leaves
from
his
knees.
вЂњYour
lord
father
was
as
true
a
man
as
the
realm
has
ever
known,
but
I
stood
by
and
let
them
slay
him.
I
said
nothing,
did
nothingвЂ¦
and
yet,
when
Joffrey
would
have
slain
me,
you
spoke
up.
Lady,
I
have
never
been
a
hero,
no
Ryam
Redwyne
or
Barristan
the
Bold.
IвЂ™ve
won
no
tourneys,
no
renown
in
warвЂ¦
but
I
was
a
knight
once,
and
you
have
helped
me
remember
what
that
meant.
My
life
is
a
poor
thing,
but
it
is
yours.вЂќ
Ser
Dontos
placed
a
hand
on
the
gnarled
bole
of
the
heart
tree.
He
was
shaking,
she
saw.
вЂњI
vow,
with
your
fatherвЂ™s
gods
as
witness,
that
I
shall
send
you
home.вЂќ

He
swore.
A
solemn
oath,
before
the
gods.
вЂњThenвЂ¦
I
will
put
myself
in
your
hands,
ser.
But
how
will
I
know,
when
it
is
time
to
go?
Will
you
send
me
another
note?вЂќ

Ser
Dontos
glanced
about
anxiously.
вЂњThe
risk
is
too
great.
You
must
come
here,
to
the
godswood.
As
often
as
you
can.
This
is
the
safest
place.
The
only
safe
place.
Nowhere
else.
Not
in
your
chambers
nor
mine
nor
on
the
steps
nor
in
the
yard,
even
if
it
seems
we
are
alone.
The
stones
have
ears
in
the
Red
Keep,
and
only
here
may
we
talk
freely.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
here,вЂќ
Sansa
said.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
remember.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
I
should
seem
cruel
or
mocking
or
indifferent
when
men
are
watching,
forgive
me,
child.
I
have
a
role
to
play,
and
you
must
do
the
same.
One
misstep
and
our
heads
will
adorn
the
walls
as
did
your
fatherвЂ™s.вЂќ

She
nodded.
вЂњI
understand.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
need
to
be
brave
and
strongвЂ¦
and
patient,
patient
above
all.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
be,вЂќ
she
promised,
вЂњbutвЂ¦
pleaseвЂ¦
make
it
as
soon
as
you
can.
IвЂ™m
afraidвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSo
am
I,вЂќ
Ser
Dontos
said,
smiling
wanly.
вЂњAnd
now
you
must
go,
before
you
are
missed.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
not
come
with
me?вЂќ

вЂњBetter
if
we
are
never
seen
together.вЂќ

Nodding,
Sansa
took
a
stepвЂ¦
then
spun
back,
nervous,
and
softly
laid
a
kiss
on
his
cheek,
her
eyes
closed.
вЂњMy
Florian,вЂќ
she
whispered.
вЂњThe
gods
heard
my
prayer.вЂќ

She
flew
along
the
river
walk,
past
the
small
kitchen,
and
through
the
pig
yard,
her
hurried
footsteps
lost
beneath
the
squealing
of
the
hogs
in
their
pens.
Home,
she
thought,
home,
he
is
going
to
take
me
home,
heвЂ™ll
keep
me
safe,
my
Florian.
The
songs
about
Florian
and
Jonquil
were
her
very
favorites.
Florian
was
homely
too,
though
not
so
old.

She
was
racing
headlong
down
the
serpentine
steps
when
a
man
lurched
out
of
a
hidden
doorway.
Sansa
caromed
into
him
and
lost
her
balance.
Iron
fingers
caught
her
by
the
wrist
before
she
could
fall,
and
a
deep
voice
rasped
at
her.
вЂњItвЂ™s
a
long
roll
down
the
serpentine,
little
bird.
Want
to
kill
us
both?вЂќ
His
laughter
was
rough
as
a
saw
on
stone.
вЂњMaybe
you
do.вЂќ

The
Hound.
вЂњNo,
my
lord,
pardons,
IвЂ™d
never.вЂќ
Sansa
averted
her
eyes
but
it
was
too
late,
heвЂ™d
seen
her
face.
вЂњPlease,
youвЂ™re
hurting
me.вЂќ
She
tried
to
wriggle
free.

вЂњAnd
whatвЂ™s
JoffвЂ™s
little
bird
doing
flying
down
the
serpentine
in
the
black
of
night?вЂќ
When
she
did
not
answer,
he
shook
her.
вЂњWhere
were
you?вЂќ

вЂњThe
g-g-godswood,
my
lord,вЂќ
she
said,
not
daring
to
lie.
вЂњPrayingвЂ¦
praying
for
my
father,
andвЂ¦
for
the
king,
praying
that
heвЂ™d
not
be
hurt.вЂќ

вЂњThink
IвЂ™m
so
drunk
that
IвЂ™d
believe
that?вЂќ
He
let
go
his
grip
on
her
arm,
swaying
slightly
as
he
stood,
stripes
of
light
and
darkness
falling
across
his
terrible
burnt
face.
вЂњYou
look
almost
a
womanвЂ¦
face,
teats,
and
youвЂ™re
taller
too,
almostвЂ¦
ah,
youвЂ™re
still
a
stupid
little
bird,
arenвЂ™t
you?
Singing
all
the
songs
they
taught
youвЂ¦
sing
me
a
song,
why
donвЂ™t
you?
Go
on.
Sing
to
me.
Some
song
about
knights
and
fair
maids.
You
like
knights,
donвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

He
was
scaring
her.
вЂњT-true
knights,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњTrue
knights,вЂќ
he
mocked.
вЂњAnd
IвЂ™m
no
lord,
no
more
than
IвЂ™m
a
knight.
Do
I
need
to
beat
that
into
you?вЂќ
Clegane
reeled
and
almost
fell.
вЂњGods,вЂќ
he
swore,
вЂњtoo
much
wine.
Do
you
like
wine,
little
bird?
True
wine?
A
flagon
of
sour
red,
dark
as
blood,
all
a
man
needs.
Or
a
woman.вЂќ
He
laughed,
shook
his
head.
вЂњDrunk
as
a
dog,
damn
me.
You
come
now.
Back
to
your
cage,
little
bird.
IвЂ™ll
take
you
there.
Keep
you
safe
for
the
king.вЂќ
The
Hound
gave
her
a
push,
oddly
gentle,
and
followed
her
down
the
steps.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom,
he
had
lapsed
back
into
a
brooding
silence,
as
if
he
had
forgotten
she
was
there.

When
they
reached
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast,
she
was
alarmed
to
see
that
it
was
Ser
Boros
Blount
who
now
held
the
bridge.
His
high
white
helm
turned
stiffly
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps.
Sansa
flinched
away
from
his
gaze.
Ser
Boros
was
the
worst
of
the
Kingsguard,
an
ugly
man
with
a
foul
temper,
all
scowls
and
jowls.

вЂњThat
one
is
nothing
to
fear,
girl.вЂќ
The
Hound
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder.
вЂњPaint
stripes
on
a
toad,
he
does
not
become
a
tiger.вЂќ

Ser
Boros
lifted
his
visor.
вЂњSer,
whereвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњFuck
your
ser,
Boros.
YouвЂ™re
the
knight,
not
me.
IвЂ™m
the
kingвЂ™s
dog,
remember?
вЂњ

вЂњThe
king
was
looking
for
his
dog
earlier.вЂќ

вЂњThe
dog
was
drinking.
It
was
your
night
to
shield
him,
ser.
You
and
my
other
brothers.вЂќ

Ser
Boros
turned
to
Sansa.
вЂњHow
is
it
you
are
not
in
your
chambers
at
this
hour,
lady?вЂќ

вЂњI
went
to
the
godswood
to
pray
for
the
safety
of
the
king.вЂќ
The
lie
sounded
better
this
time,
almost
true.

вЂњYou
expect
her
to
sleep
with
all
the
noise?вЂќ
Clegane
said.
вЂњWhat
was
the
trouble?вЂќ

вЂњFools
at
the
gate,вЂќ
Ser
Boros
admitted.
вЂњSome
loose
tongues
spread
tales
of
the
preparations
for
TyrekвЂ™s
wedding
feast,
and
these
wretches
got
it
in
their
heads
they
should
be
feasted
too.
His
Grace
led
a
sortie
and
sent
them
scurrying.вЂќ

вЂњA
brave
boy,вЂќ
Clegane
said,
mouth
twitching.

Let
us
see
how
brave
he
is
when
he
faces
my
brother,
Sansa
thought.
The
Hound
escorted
her
across
the
drawbridge.
As
they
were
winding
their
way
up
the
steps,
she
said,
вЂњWhy
do
you
let
people
call
you
a
dog?
You
wonвЂ™t
let
anyone
call
you
a
knight.вЂќ

вЂњI
like
dogs
better
than
knights.
My
fatherвЂ™s
father
was
kennelmaster
at
the
Rock.
One
autumn
year,
Lord
Tytos
came
between
a
lioness
and
her
prey.
The
lioness
didnвЂ™t
give
a
shit
that
she
was
LannisterвЂ™s
own
sigil.
Bitch
tore
into
my
lordвЂ™s
horse
and
would
have
done
for
my
lord
too,
but
my
grandfather
came
up
with
the
hounds.
Three
of
his
dogs
died
running
her
off.
My
grandfather
lost
a
leg,
so
Lannister
paid
him
for
it
with
lands
and
a
towerhouse,
and
took
his
son
to
squire.
The
three
dogs
on
our
banner
are
the
three
that
died,
in
the
yellow
of
autumn
grass.
A
hound
will
die
for
you,
but
never
lie
to
you.
And
heвЂ™ll
look
you
straight
in
the
face.вЂќ
He
cupped
her
under
the
jaw,
raising
her
chin,
his
fingers
pinching
her
painfully.
вЂњAnd
thatвЂ™s
more
than
little
birds
can
do,
isnвЂ™t
it?
I
never
got
my
song.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦
I
know
a
song
about
Florian
and
Jonquil.вЂќ

вЂњFlorian
and
Jonquil?
A
fool
and
his
cunt.
Spare
me.
But
one
day
IвЂ™ll
have
a
song
from
you,
whether
you
will
it
or
no.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
sing
it
for
you
gladly.вЂќ

Sandor
Clegane
snorted.
вЂњPretty
thing,
and
such
a
bad
liar.
A
dog
can
smell
a
lie,
you
know.
Look
around
you,
and
take
a
good
whiff.
TheyвЂ™re
all
liars
hereвЂ¦
and
every
one
better
than
you.вЂќ





ARYA

When
she
climbed
all
the
way
up
to
the
highest
branch,
Arya
could
see
chimneys
poking
through
the
trees.
Thatched
roofs
clustered
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
the
small
stream
that
emptied
into
it,
and
a
wooden
pier
jutted
out
into
the
water
beside
a
low
long
building
with
a
slate
roof.

She
skinnied
farther
out,
until
the
branch
began
to
sag
under
her
weight.
No
boats
were
tied
to
the
pier,
but
she
could
see
thin
tendrils
of
smoke
rising
from
some
of
the
chimneys,
and
part
of
a
wagon
jutting
out
behind
a
stable.

SomeoneвЂ™s
there.
Arya
chewed
her
lip.
All
the
other
places
theyвЂ™d
come
upon
had
been
empty
and
desolate.
Farms,
villages,
castles,
septs,
barns,
it
made
no
matter.
If
it
could
burn,
the
Lannisters
had
burned
it;
if
it
could
die,
theyвЂ™d
killed
it.
They
had
even
set
the
woods
ablaze
where
they
could,
though
the
leaves
were
still
green
and
wet
from
recent
rains,
and
the
fires
had
not
spread.
вЂњThey
would
have
burned
the
lake
if
they
could
have,вЂќ
Gendry
had
said,
and
Arya
knew
he
was
right.
On
the
night
of
their
escape,
the
flames
of
the
burning
town
had
shimmered
so
brightly
on
the
water
that
it
had
seemed
that
the
lake
was
afire.

When
they
finally
summoned
the
nerve
to
steal
back
into
the
ruins
the
next
night,
nothing
remained
but
blackened
stones,
the
hollow
shells
of
houses,
and
corpses.
In
some
places
wisps
of
pale
smoke
still
rose
from
the
ashes.
Hot
Pie
had
pleaded
with
them
not
to
go
back,
and
Lommy
called
them
fools
and
swore
that
Ser
Amory
would
catch
them
and
kill
them
too,
but
Lorch
and
his
men
had
long
gone
by
the
time
they
reached
the
holdfast.
They
found
the
gates
broken
down,
the
walls
partly
demolished,
and
the
inside
strewn
with
the
unburied
dead.
One
look
was
enough
for
Gendry.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
killed,
every
one,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњAnd
dogs
have
been
at
them
too,
look.вЂќ

вЂњOr
wolves.вЂќ

вЂњDogs,
wolves,
it
makes
no
matter.
ItвЂ™s
done
here.вЂќ

But
Arya
would
not
leave
until
they
found
Yoren.
They
couldnвЂ™t
have
killed
him,
she
told
herself,
he
was
too
hard
and
tough,
and
a
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
besides.
She
said
as
much
to
Gendry
as
they
searched
among
the
corpses.

The
axe
blow
that
had
killed
him
had
split
his
skull
apart,
but
the
great
tangled
beard
could
be
no
one
elseвЂ™s,
or
the
garb,
patched
and
unwashed
and
so
faded
it
was
more
grey
than
black.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
had
given
no
more
thought
to
burying
his
own
dead
than
to
those
he
had
murdered,
and
the
corpses
of
four
Lannister
men-at-arms
were
heaped
near
YorenвЂ™s.
Arya
wondered
how
many
it
had
taken
to
bring
him
down.

He
was
going
to
take
me
home,
she
thought
as
they
dug
the
old
manвЂ™s
hole.
There
were
too
many
dead
to
bury
them
all,
but
Yoren
at
least
must
have
a
grave,
Arya
had
insisted.
He
was
going
to
bring
me
safe
to
Winterfell,
he
promised.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
cry.
The
other
part
wanted
to
kick
him.

It
was
Gendry
who
thought
of
the
lordвЂ™s
towerhouse
and
the
three
that
Yoren
had
sent
to
hold
it.
They
had
come
under
attack
as
well,
but
the
round
tower
had
only
one
entry,
a
second-story
door
reached
by
a
ladder.
Once
that
had
been
pulled
inside,
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
men
could
not
get
at
them.
The
Lannisters
had
piled
brush
around
the
towerвЂ™s
base
and
set
it
afire,
but
the
stone
would
not
burn,
and
Lorch
did
not
have
the
patience
to
starve
them
out.
Cutjack
opened
the
door
at
GendryвЂ™s
shout,
and
when
Kurz
said
theyвЂ™d
be
better
pressing
on
north
than
going
back,
Arya
had
clung
to
the
hope
that
she
still
might
reach
Winterfell.

Well,
this
village
was
no
Winterfell,
but
those
thatched
roofs
promised
warmth
and
shelter
and
maybe
even
food,
if
they
were
bold
enough
to
risk
them.
Unless
itвЂ™s
Lorch
there.
He
had
horses;
he
would
have
traveled
faster
than
us.

She
watched
from
the
tree
for
a
long
time,
hoping
she
might
see
something;
a
man,
a
horse,
a
banner,
anything
that
would
help
her
know.
A
few
times
she
glimpsed
motion,
but
the
buildings
were
so
far
off
it
was
hard
to
be
certain.
Once,
very
clearly,
she
heard
the
whinny
of
a
horse.

The
air
was
full
of
birds,
crows
mostly.
From
afar,
they
were
no
larger
than
flies
as
they
wheeled
and
flapped
above
the
thatched
roofs.
To
the
east,
Gods
Eye
was
a
sheet
of
sun-hammered
blue
that
filled
half
the
world.
Some
days,
as
they
made
their
slow
way
up
the
muddy
shore
(Gendry
wanted
no
part
of
any
roads,
and
even
Hot
Pie
and
Lommy
saw
the
sense
in
that),
Arya
felt
as
though
the
lake
were
calling
her.
She
wanted
to
leap
into
those
placid
blue
waters,
to
feel
clean
again,
to
swim
and
splash
and
bask
in
the
sun.
But
she
dare
not
take
off
her
clothes
where
the
others
could
see,
not
even
to
wash
them.
At
the
end
of
the
day
she
would
often
sit
on
a
rock
and
dangle
her
feet
in
the
cool
water.
She
had
finally
thrown
away
her
cracked
and
rotted
shoes.
Walking
barefoot
was
hard
at
first,
but
the
blisters
had
finally
broken,
the
cuts
had
healed,
and
her
soles
had
turned
to
leather.
The
mud
was
nice
between
her
toes,
and
she
liked
to
feel
the
earth
underfoot
when
she
walked.

From
up
here,
she
could
see
a
small
wooded
island
off
to
the
northeast.
Thirty
yards
from
shore,
three
black
swans
were
gliding
over
the
water,
so
sereneвЂ¦
no
one
had
told
them
that
war
had
come,
and
they
cared
nothing
for
burning
towns
and
butchered
men.
She
stared
at
them
with
yearning.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
be
a
swan.
The
other
part
wanted
to
eat
one.
She
had
broken
her
fast
on
some
acorn
paste
and
a
handful
of
bugs.
Bugs
werenвЂ™t
so
bad
when
you
got
used
to
them.
Worms
were
worse,
but
still
not
as
bad
as
the
pain
in
your
belly
after
days
without
food.
Finding
bugs
was
easy,
all
you
had
to
do
was
kick
over
a
rock.
Arya
had
eaten
a
bug
once
when
she
was
little,
just
to
make
Sansa
screech,
so
she
hadnвЂ™t
been
afraid
to
eat
another.
Weasel
wasnвЂ™t
either,
but
Hot
Pie
retched
up
the
beetle
he
tried
to
swallow,
and
Lommy
and
Gendry
wouldnвЂ™t
even
try.
Yesterday
Gendry
had
caught
a
frog
and
shared
it
with
Lommy,
and,
a
few
days
before,
Hot
Pie
had
found
blackberries
and
stripped
the
bush
bare,
but
mostly
they
had
been
living
on
water
and
acorns.
Kurz
had
told
them
how
to
use
rocks
and
make
a
kind
of
acorn
paste.
it
tasted
awful.

She
wished
the
poacher
hadnвЂ™t
died.
HeвЂ™d
known
more
about
the
woods
than
all
the
rest
of
them
together,
but
heвЂ™d
taken
an
arrow
through
the
shoulder
pulling
in
the
ladder
at
the
towerhouse.
Tarber
had
packed
it
with
mud
and
moss
from
the
lake,
and
for
a
day
or
two
Kurz
swore
the
wound
was
nothing,
even
though
the
flesh
of
his
throat
was
turning
dark
while
angry
red
welts
crept
up
his
jaw
and
down
his
chest.
Then
one
morning
he
couldnвЂ™t
find
the
strength
to
get
up,
and
by
the
next
he
was
dead.

They
buried
him
under
a
mound
of
stones,
and
Cutjack
had
claimed
his
sword
and
hunting
horn,
while
Tarber
helped
himself
to
bow
and
boots
and
knife.
TheyвЂ™d
taken
it
all
when
they
left.
At
first
they
thought
the
two
had
just
gone
hunting,
that
theyвЂ™d
soon
return
with
game
and
feed
them
all.
But
they
waited
and
waited,
until
finally
Gendry
made
them
move
on.
Maybe
Tarber
and
Cutjack
figured
they
would
stand
a
better
chance
without
a
gaggle
of
orphan
boys
to
herd
along.
They
probably
would
too,
but
that
didnвЂ™t
stop
her
hating
them
for
leaving.

Beneath
her
tree,
Hot
Pie
barked
like
a
dog.
Kurz
had
told
them
to
use
animal
sounds
to
signal
to
each
other.
An
old
poacherвЂ™s
trick,
heвЂ™d
said,
but
heвЂ™d
died
before
he
could
teach
them
how
to
make
the
sounds
right.
Hot
PieвЂ™s
bird
calls
were
awful.
His
dog
was
better,
but
not
much.

Arya
hopped
from
the
high
branch
to
one
beneath
it,
her
hands
out
for
balance.
A
water
dancer
never
falls.
Lightfoot,
her
toes
curled
tight
around
the
branch,
she
walked
a
few
feet,
hopped
down
to
a
larger
limb,
then
swung
hand
over
hand
through
the
tangle
of
leaves
until
she
reached
the
trunk.
The
bark
was
rough
beneath
her
fingers,
against
her
toes.
She
descended
quickly,
jumping
down
the
final
six
feet,
rolling
when
she
landed.

Gendry
gave
her
a
hand
to
pull
her
up.
вЂњYou
were
up
there
a
long
time.
What
could
you
see?вЂќ

вЂњA
fishing
village,
just
a
little
place,
north
along
the
shore.
Twenty-six
thatch
roofs
and
one
slate,
I
counted.
I
saw
part
of
a
wagon.
SomeoneвЂ™s
there.вЂќ

At
the
sound
of
her
voice,
Weasel
came
creeping
out
from
the
bushes.
Lommy
had
named
her
that.
He
said
she
looked
like
a
weasel,
which
wasnвЂ™t
true,
but
they
couldnвЂ™t
keep
on
calling
her
the
crying
girl
after
she
finally
stopped
crying.
Her
mouth
was
filthy.
Arya
hoped
she
hadnвЂ™t
been
eating
mud
again.

вЂњDid
you
see
people?вЂќ
asked
Gendry.

вЂњMostly
just
roofs,вЂќ
Arya
admitted,
вЂњbut
some
chimneys
were
smoking,
and
I
heard
a
horse.вЂќ
The
Weasel
put
her
arms
around
her
leg,
clutching
tight.
Sometimes
she
did
that
now.

вЂњIf
thereвЂ™s
people,
thereвЂ™s
food,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said,
too
loudly.
Gendry
was
always
telling
him
to
be
more
quiet,
but
it
never
did
any
good.
вЂњMight
be
theyвЂ™d
give
us
some.вЂќ

вЂњMight
be
theyвЂ™d
kill
us
too,вЂќ
Gendry
said.

вЂњNot
if
we
yielded,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said
hopefully.

вЂњNow
you
sound
like
Lommy.вЂќ

Lommy
Greenhands
sat
propped
up
between
two
thick
roots
at
the
foot
of
an
oak.
A
spear
had
taken
him
through
his
left
calf
during
the
fight
at
the
holdfast.
By
the
end
of
the
next
day,
he
had
to
limp
along
one-legged
with
an
arm
around
Gendry,
and
now
he
couldnвЂ™t
even
do
that.
TheyвЂ™d
hacked
branches
off
trees
to
make
a
litter
for
him,
but
it
was
slow,
hard
work
carrying
him
along,
and
he
whimpered
every
time
they
jounced
him.

вЂњWe
have
to
yield,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
what
Yoren
should
have
done.
He
should
have
opened
the
gates
like
they
said.вЂќ

Arya
was
sick
of
Lommy
going
on
about
how
Yoren
should
have
yielded.
It
was
all
he
talked
about
when
they
carried
him,
that
and
his
leg
and
his
empty
belly.

Hot
Pie
agreed.
вЂњThey
told
Yoren
to
open
the
gates,
they
told
him
in
the
kingвЂ™s
name.
You
have
to
do
what
they
tell
you
in
the
kingвЂ™s
name.
It
was
that
stinky
old
manвЂ™s
fault.
If
heвЂ™d
of
yielded,
they
would
have
left
us
be.вЂќ

Gendry
frowned.
вЂњKnights
and
lordlings,
they
take
each
other
captive
and
pay
ransoms,
but
they
donвЂ™t
care
if
the
likes
of
you
yield
or
not.вЂќ
He
turned
to
Arya.
вЂњWhat
else
did
you
see?вЂќ

вЂњIf
itвЂ™s
a
fishing
village,
theyвЂ™d
sell
us
fish,
I
bet,вЂќ
said
Hot
Pie.
The
lake
teemed
with
fresh
fish,
but
they
had
nothing
to
catch
them
with.
Arya
had
tried
to
use
her
hands,
the
way
sheвЂ™d
seen
Koss
do,
but
fish
were
quicker
than
pigeons
and
the
water
played
tricks
on
her
eyes.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
know
about
fish.вЂќ
Arya
tugged
at
the
WeaselвЂ™s
matted
hair,
thinking
it
might
be
best
to
hack
it
off.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
crows
down
by
the
water.
SomethingвЂ™s
dead
there.вЂќ

вЂњFish,
washed
up
on
shore,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said.
вЂњIf
the
crows
eat
it,
I
bet
we
could.вЂќ

вЂњWe
should
catch
some
crows,
we
could
eat
them,вЂќ
said
Lommy.
вЂњWe
could
make
a
fire
and
roast
them
like
chickens.вЂќ

Gendry
looked
fierce
when
he
scowled.
His
beard
had
grown
in
thick
and
black
as
briar.
вЂњI
said,
no
fires.вЂќ

вЂњLommyвЂ™s
hungry,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
whined,
вЂњand
I
am
too.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™re
all
hungry,вЂќ
said
Arya.

вЂњYouвЂ™re
not,вЂќ
Lommy
spat
from
the
ground.
вЂњWorm
breath.вЂќ

Arya
could
have
kicked
him
in
his
wound.
вЂњI
said
IвЂ™d
dig
worms
for
you
too,
if
you
wanted.вЂќ

Lommy
made
a
disgusted
face.
вЂњIf
it
wasnвЂ™t
for
my
leg,
IвЂ™d
hunt
us
some
boars.вЂќ

вЂњSome
boars,вЂќ
she
mocked.
вЂњYou
need
a
boarspear
to
hunt
boars,
and
horses
and
dogs,
and
men
to
flush
the
boar
from
its
lair.вЂќ
Her
father
had
hunted
boar
in
the
wolfswood
with
Robb
and
Jon.
Once
he
even
took
Bran,
but
never
Arya,
even
though
she
was
older.
Septa
Mordane
said
boar
hunting
was
not
for
ladies,
and
Mother
only
promised
that
when
she
was
older
she
might
have
her
own
hawk.
She
was
older
now,
but
if
she
had
a
hawk
sheвЂ™d
eat
it.

вЂњWhat
do
you
know
about
hunting
boars?вЂќ
said
Hot
Pie.

вЂњMore
than
you.вЂќ

Gendry
was
in
no
mood
to
hear
it.
вЂњQuiet,
both
of
you,
I
need
to
think
what
to
do.вЂќ
He
always
looked
pained
when
he
tried
to
think,
like
it
hurt
him
something
fierce.

вЂњYield,вЂќ
Lommy
said.

вЂњI
told
you
to
shut
up
about
the
yielding.
We
donвЂ™t
even
know
whoвЂ™s
in
there.
Maybe
we
can
steal
some
food.вЂќ

вЂњLommy
could
steal,
if
it
wasnвЂ™t
for
his
leg,вЂќ
said
Hot
Pie.
вЂњHe
was
a
thief
in
the
city.вЂќ

вЂњA
bad
thief,вЂќ
Arya
said,
вЂњor
he
wouldnвЂ™t
have
got
caught.вЂќ

Gendry
squinted
up
at
the
sun.
вЂњEvenfall
will
be
the
best
time
to
sneak
in.
IвЂ™ll
go
scout
come
dark.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
IвЂ™ll
go,вЂќ
Arya
said.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
too
noisy.вЂќ

Gendry
got
that
look
on
his
face.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
both
go.вЂќ

вЂњArry
should
go,вЂќ
said
Lommy.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
sneakier
than
you
are.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
both
go,
I
said.вЂќ

вЂњBut
what
if
you
donвЂ™t
come
back?
Hot
Pie
canвЂ™t
carry
me
by
himself,
you
know
he
canвЂ™tвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAnd
thereвЂ™s
wolves,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said.
вЂњI
heard
them
last
night,
when
I
had
the
watch.
They
sounded
close.вЂќ

Arya
had
heard
them
too.
SheвЂ™d
been
asleep
in
the
branches
of
an
elm,
but
the
howling
had
woken
her.
SheвЂ™d
sat
awake
for
a
good
hour,
listening
to
them,
prickles
creeping
up
her
spine.

вЂњAnd
you
wonвЂ™t
even
let
us
have
a
fire
to
keep
them
off,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said.
вЂњItвЂ™s
not
right,
leaving
us
for
the
wolves.вЂќ

вЂњNo
one
is
leaving
you,вЂќ
Gendry
said
in
disgust.
вЂњLommy
has
his
spear
if
the
wolves
come,
and
youвЂ™ll
be
with
him.
WeвЂ™re
just
going
to
go
see,
thatвЂ™s
all;
weвЂ™re
coming
back.вЂќ

вЂњWhoever
it
is,
you
should
yield
to
them,вЂќ
Lommy
whined.
вЂњI
need
some
potion
for
my
leg,
it
hurts
bad.вЂќ

вЂњIf
we
see
any
leg
potion,
weвЂ™ll
bring
it,вЂќ
Gendry
said.
вЂњArry,
letвЂ™s
go,
I
want
to
get
near
before
the
sun
is
down.
Hot
Pie,
you
keep
Weasel
here,
I
donвЂ™t
want
her
following.вЂќ

вЂњLast
time
she
kicked
me.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
kick
you
if
you
donвЂ™t
keep
her
here.вЂќ
Without
waiting
for
an
answer,
Gendry
donned
his
steel
helm
and
walked
off.

Arya
had
to
scamper
to
keep
up.
Gendry
was
five
years
older
and
a
foot
taller
than
she
was,
and
long
of
leg
as
well.
For
a
while
he
said
nothing,
just
plowed
on
through
the
trees
with
an
angry
look
on
his
face,
making
too
much
noise.
But
finally
he
stopped
and
said,
вЂњI
think
LommyвЂ™s
going
to
die.вЂќ

She
was
not
surprised.
Kurz
had
died
of
his
wound,
and
heвЂ™d
been
a
lot
stronger
than
Lommy.
Whenever
it
was
AryaвЂ™s
turn
to
help
carry
him,
she
could
feel
how
warm
his
skin
was,
and
smell
the
stink
off
his
leg.
вЂњMaybe
we
could
find
a
maesterвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
only
find
maesters
in
castles,
and
even
if
we
found
one,
he
wouldnвЂ™t
dirty
his
hands
on
the
likes
of
Lommy.вЂќ
Gendry
ducked
under
a
low-hanging
limb.

вЂњThatвЂ™s
not
true.вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
would
have
helped
anyone
who
came
to
him,
she
was
certain.

вЂњHeвЂ™s
going
to
die,
and
the
sooner
he
does
it,
the
better
for
the
rest
of
us.
We
should
just
leave
him,
like
he
says.
If
it
was
you
or
me
hurt,
you
know
heвЂ™d
leave
us.вЂќ
They
scrambled
down
a
steep
cut
and
up
the
other
side,
using
roots
for
handholds.
вЂњIвЂ™m
sick
of
carrying
him,
and
IвЂ™m
sick
of
all
his
talk
about
yielding
too.
If
he
could
stand
up,
IвЂ™d
knock
his
teeth
in.
LommyвЂ™s
no
use
to
anyone.
That
crying
girlвЂ™s
no
use
either.вЂќ

вЂњYou
leave
Weasel
alone,
sheвЂ™s
just
scared
and
hungry
is
all.вЂќ
Arya
glanced
back,
but
the
girl
was
not
following
for
once.
Hot
Pie
must
have
grabbed
her,
like
Gendry
had
told
him.

вЂњSheвЂ™s
no
use,вЂќ
Gendry
repeated
stubbornly.
вЂњHer
and
Hot
Pie
and
Lommy,
theyвЂ™re
slowing
us
down,
and
theyвЂ™re
going
to
get
us
killed.
YouвЂ™re
the
only
one
of
the
bunch
whoвЂ™s
good
for
anything.
Even
if
you
are
a
girl.вЂќ

Arya
froze
in
her
steps.
вЂњIвЂ™m
not
a
girl!вЂќ

вЂњYes
you
are.
Do
you
think
IвЂ™m
as
stupid
as
they
are?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
youвЂ™re
stupider.
The
NightвЂ™s
Watch
doesnвЂ™t
take
girls,
everyone
knows
that.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
true.
I
donвЂ™t
know
why
Yoren
brought
you,
but
he
must
have
had
some
reason.
YouвЂ™re
still
a
girl.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
not!вЂќ

вЂњThen
pull
out
your
cock
and
take
a
piss.
Go
on.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
need
to
take
a
piss.
If
I
wanted
to
I
could.вЂќ

вЂњLiar.
You
canвЂ™t
take
out
your
cock
because
you
donвЂ™t
have
one.
I
never
noticed
before
when
there
were
thirty
of
us,
but
you
always
go
off
in
the
woods
to
make
your
water.
You
donвЂ™t
see
Hot
Pie
doing
that,
nor
me
neither.
If
youвЂ™re
not
a
girl,
you
must
be
some
eunuch.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
the
eunuch.вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
IвЂ™m
not.вЂќ
Gendry
smiled.
вЂњYou
want
me
to
take
out
my
cock
and
prove
it?
I
donвЂ™t
have
anything
to
hide.вЂќ

вЂњYes
you
do,вЂќ
Arya
blurted,
desperate
to
escape
the
subject
of
the
cock
she
didnвЂ™t
have.
вЂњThose
gold
cloaks
were
after
you
at
the
inn,
and
you
wonвЂ™t
tell
us
why.вЂќ

вЂњI
wish
I
knew.
I
think
Yoren
knew,
but
he
never
told
me.
Why
did
you
think
they
were
after
you,
though?вЂќ

Arya
bit
her
lip.
She
remembered
what
Yoren
had
said,
the
day
he
had
hacked
off
her
hair.
This
lot,
half
oвЂ™
them
would
turn
you
over
to
the
queen
quick
as
spit
for
a
pardon
and
maybe
a
few
silvers.
The
other
halfвЂ™d
do
the
same,
only
theyвЂ™d
rape
you
first.
Only
Gendry
was
different,
the
queen
wanted
him
too.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
tell
you
if
youвЂ™ll
tell
me,вЂќ
she
said
warily.

вЂњI
would
if
I
knew,
ArryвЂ¦
is
that
really
what
youвЂ™re
called,
or
do
you
have
some
girlвЂ™s
name?вЂќ

Arya
glared
at
the
gnarled
root
by
her
feet.
She
realized
that
the
pretense
was
done.
Gendry
knew,
and
she
had
nothing
in
her
pants
to
convince
him
otherwise.
She
could
draw
Needle
and
kill
him
where
he
stood,
or
else
trust
him.
She
wasnвЂ™t
certain
sheвЂ™d
be
able
to
kill
him,
even
if
she
tried;
he
had
his
own
sword,
and
he
was
a
lot
stronger.
All
that
was
left
was
the
truth.
вЂњLommy
and
Hot
Pie
canвЂ™t
know,вЂќ
she
said.

вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t,вЂќ
he
swore.
вЂњNot
from
me.вЂќ

вЂњArya.вЂќ
She
raised
her
eyes
to
his.
вЂњMy
name
is
Arya.
Of
House
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњOf
HouseвЂ¦вЂќ
It
took
him
a
moment
before
he
said,
вЂњThe
KingвЂ™s
Hand
was
named
Stark.
The
one
they
killed
for
a
traitor.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
never
a
traitor.
He
was
my
father.вЂќ

GendryвЂ™s
eyes
widened.
вЂњSo
thatвЂ™s
why
you
thoughtвЂ¦вЂќ

She
nodded.
вЂњYoren
was
taking
me
home
to
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦
youвЂ™re
highborn
then,
aвЂ¦
youвЂ™ll
be
a
ladyвЂ¦вЂќ

Arya
looked
down
at
her
ragged
clothes
and
bare
feet,
all
cracked
and
callused.
She
saw
the
dirt
under
her
nails,
the
scabs
on
her
elbows,
the
scratches
on
her
hands.
Septa
Mordane
wouldnвЂ™t
even
know
me,
I
bet.
Sansa
might,
but
sheвЂ™d
pretend
not
to.
вЂњMy
motherвЂ™s
a
lady,
and
my
sister,
but
I
never
was.вЂќ

вЂњYes
you
were.
You
were
a
lordвЂ™s
daughter
and
you
lived
in
a
castle,
didnвЂ™t
you?
And
youвЂ¦
gods
be
good,
I
neverвЂ¦вЂќ
All
of
a
sudden
Gendry
seemed
uncertain,
almost
afraid.
вЂњAll
that
about
cocks,
I
never
should
have
said
that.
And
I
been
pissing
in
front
of
you
and
everything,
IвЂ¦
I
beg
your
pardon,
mвЂ™lady.вЂќ

вЂњStop
that!вЂќ
Arya
hissed.
Was
he
mocking
her?

вЂњI
know
my
courtesies,
mвЂ™lady,вЂќ
Gendry
said,
stubborn
as
ever.
вЂњWhenever
highborn
girls
came
into
the
shop
with
their
fathers,
my
master
told
me
I
was
to
bend
the
knee,
and
speak
only
when
they
spoke
to
me,
and
call
them
mвЂ™lady.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
start
calling
me
mвЂ™lady,
even
Hot
Pie
is
going
to
notice.
And
you
better
keep
on
pissing
the
same
way
too.вЂќ

вЂњAs
mвЂ™lady
commands.вЂќ

Arya
slammed
his
chest
with
both
hands.
He
tripped
over
a
stone
and
sat
down
with
a
thump.
вЂњWhat
kind
of
lordвЂ™s
daughter
are
you?вЂќ
he
said,
laughing.

вЂњThis
kind.вЂќ
She
kicked
him
in
the
side,
but
it
only
made
him
laugh
harder.
вЂњYou
laugh
all
you
like.
IвЂ™m
going
to
see
whoвЂ™s
in
the
village.вЂќ
The
sun
had
already
fallen
below
the
trees;
dusk
would
be
on
them
in
no
time
at
all.
For
once
it
was
Gendry
who
had
to
hurry
after.
вЂњYou
smell
that?вЂќ
she
asked.

He
sniffed
the
air.
вЂњRotten
fish?вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
itвЂ™s
not.вЂќ

вЂњWe
better
be
careful.
IвЂ™ll
go
around
west,
see
if
thereвЂ™s
some
road.
There
must
be
if
you
saw
a
wagon.
You
take
the
shore.
If
you
need
help,
bark
like
a
dog.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
stupid.
If
I
need
help,
IвЂ™ll
shout
help.вЂќ
She
darted
away,
bare
feet
silent
in
the
grass.
When
she
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder,
he
was
watching
her
with
that
pained
look
on
his
face
that
meant
he
was
thinking.
HeвЂ™s
probably
thinking
that
he
shouldnвЂ™t
be
letting
mвЂ™lady
go
stealing
food.
Arya
just
knew
he
was
going
to
be
stupid
now.

The
smell
grew
stronger
as
she
got
closer
to
the
village.
It
did
not
smell
like
rotten
fish
to
her.
This
stench
was
ranker,
fouler.
She
wrinkled
her
nose.

Where
the
trees
began
to
thin,
she
used
the
undergrowth,
slipping
from
bush
to
bush
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Every
few
yards
she
stopped
to
listen.
The
third
time,
she
heard
horses,
and
a
manвЂ™s
voice
as
well.
And
the
smell
got
worse.
Dead
manвЂ™s
stink,
thatвЂ™s
what
it
is.
She
had
smelled
it
before,
with
Yoren
and
the
others.

A
dense
thicket
of
brambles
grew
south
of
the
village.
By
the
time
she
reached
it,
the
long
shadows
of
sunset
had
begun
to
fade,
and
the
lantern
bugs
were
coming
out.
She
could
see
thatched
roofs
just
beyond
the
hedge.
She
crept
along
until
she
found
a
gap
and
squirmed
through
on
her
belly,
keeping
well
hidden
until
she
saw
what
made
the
smell.

Beside
the
gently
lapping
waters
of
Gods
Eye,
a
long
gibbet
of
raw
green
wood
had
been
thrown
up,
and
things
that
had
once
been
men
dangled
there,
their
feet
in
chains,
while
crows
pecked
at
their
flesh
and
flapped
from
corpse
to
corpse.
For
every
crow
there
were
a
hundred
flies.
When
the
wind
blew
off
the
lake,
the
nearest
corpse
twisted
on
its
chain,
ever
so
slightly.
The
crows
had
eaten
most
of
its
face,
and
something
else
had
been
at
it
as
well,
something
much
larger.
Throat
and
chest
had
been
torn
apart,
and
glistening
green
entrails
and
ribbons
of
ragged
flesh
dangled
from
where
the
belly
had
been
opened.
one
arm
had
been
ripped
right
off
the
shoulder;
Arya
saw
the
bones
a
few
feet
away,
gnawed
and
cracked,
picked
clean
of
meat.

She
made
herself
look
at
the
next
man
and
the
one
beyond
him
and
the
one
beyond
him,
telling
herself
she
was
hard
as
a
stone.
Corpses
all,
so
savaged
and
decayed
that
it
took
her
a
moment
to
realize
they
had
been
stripped
before
they
were
hanged.
They
did
not
look
like
naked
people;
they
hardly
looked
like
people
at
all.
The
crows
had
eaten
their
eyes,
and
sometimes
their
faces.
Of
the
sixth
in
the
long
row,
nothing
remained
but
a
single
leg,
still
tangled
in
its
chains,
swaying
with
each
breeze.

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Dead
men
could
not
hurt
her,
but
whoever
had
killed
them
could.
Well
beyond
the
gibbet,
two
men
in
mail
hauberks
stood
leaning
on
their
spears
in
front
of
the
long
low
building
by
the
water,
the
one
with
the
slate
roof.
A
pair
of
tall
poles
had
been
driven
into
the
muddy
ground
in
front
of
it,
banners
drooping
from
each
staff.
One
looked
red
and
one
paler,
white
or
yellow
maybe,
but
both
were
limp
and
with
the
dusk
settling,
she
could
not
even
be
certain
that
red
one
was
Lannister
crimson.
I
donвЂ™t
need
to
see
the
lion,
I
can
see
all
the
dead
people,
who
else
would
it
be
but
Lannisters?

Then
there
was
a
shout.

The
two
spearmen
turned
at
the
cry,
and
a
third
man
came
into
view,
shoving
a
captive
before
him.
It
was
growing
too
dark
to
make
out
faces,
but
the
prisoner
was
wearing
a
shiny
steel
helm,
and
when
Arya
saw
the
horns
she
knew
it
was
Gendry.
You
stupid
stupid
stupid
STUPID!
she
thought.
If
heвЂ™d
been
here
she
would
have
kicked
him
again.

The
guards
were
talking
loudly,
but
she
was
too
far
away
to
make
out
the
words,
especially
with
the
crows
gabbling
and
flapping
closer
to
hand.
One
of
the
spearmen
snatched
the
helm
off
GendryвЂ™s
head
and
asked
him
a
question,
but
he
must
not
have
liked
the
answer,
because
he
smashed
him
across
the
face
with
the
butt
of
his
spear
and
knocked
him
down.
The
one
whoвЂ™d
captured
him
gave
him
a
kick,
while
the
second
spearman
was
trying
on
the
bullвЂ™s-head
helm.
Finally
they
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
marched
him
off
toward
the
storehouse.
When
they
opened
the
heavy
wooden
doors,
a
small
boy
darted
out,
but
one
of
the
guards
grabbed
his
arm
and
flung
him
back
inside.
Arya
heard
sobbing
from
inside
the
building,
and
then
a
shriek
so
loud
and
full
of
pain
that
it
made
her
bite
her
lip.

The
guards
shoved
Gendry
inside
with
the
boy
and
barred
the
doors
behind
them.
Just
then,
a
breath
of
wind
came
sighing
off
the
lake,
and
the
banners
stirred
and
lifted.
The
one
on
the
tall
staff
bore
the
golden
lion,
as
sheвЂ™d
feared.
On
the
other,
three
sleek
black
shapes
ran
across
a
field
as
yellow
as
butter.
Dogs,
she
thought.
Arya
had
seen
those
dogs
before,
but
where?

It
didnвЂ™t
matter.
The
only
thing
that
mattered
was
that
they
had
Gendry.
Even
if
he
was
stubborn
and
stupid,
she
had
to
get
him
out.
She
wondered
if
they
knew
that
the
queen
wanted
him.

One
of
the
guards
took
off
his
helm
and
donned
GendryвЂ™s
instead.
It
made
her
angry
to
see
him
wearing
it,
but
she
knew
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
to
stop
him.
She
thought
she
heard
more
screams
from
inside
the
windowless
storehouse,
muffled
by
the
masonry,
but
it
was
hard
to
be
certain.

She
stayed
long
enough
to
see
the
guard
changed,
and
much
more
besides.
Men
came
and
went.
They
led
their
horses
down
to
the
stream
to
drink.
A
hunting
party
returned
from
the
wood,
carrying
a
deerвЂ™s
carcass
slung
from
a
pole.
She
watched
them
clean
and
gut
it
and
build
a
cookfire
on
the
far
side
of
the
stream,
and
the
smell
of
cooking
meat
mingled
queerly
with
the
stench
of
corruption.
Her
empty
belly
roiled
and
she
thought
she
might
retch.
The
prospect
of
food
brought
other
men
out
of
the
houses,
near
all
of
them
wearing
bits
of
mail
or
boiled
leather.
When
the
deer
was
cooked,
the
choicest
portions
were
carried
to
one
of
the
houses.

She
thought
that
the
dark
might
let
her
crawl
close
and
free
Gendry,
but
the
guards
kindled
torches
off
the
cookfire.
A
squire
brought
meat
and
bread
to
the
two
guarding
the
storehouse,
and
later
two
more
men
joined
them
and
they
all
passed
a
skin
of
wine
from
hand
to
hand.
When
it
was
empty
the
others
left,
but
the
two
guards
remained,
leaning
on
their
spears.

AryaвЂ™s
arms
and
legs
were
stiff
when
she
finally
wriggled
out
from
under
the
briar
into
the
dark
of
the
wood.
It
was
a
black
night,
with
a
thin
sliver
of
moon
appearing
and
disappearing
as
the
clouds
blew
past.
Silent
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself
as
she
moved
through
the
trees.
In
this
darkness
she
dared
not
run,
for
fear
of
tripping
on
some
unseen
root
or
losing
her
way.
On
her
left
Gods
Eye
lapped
calmly
against
its
shores.
on
her
right
a
wind
sighed
through
the
branches,
and
leaves
rustled
and
stirred.
Far
off,
she
heard
the
howling
of
wolves.

Lommy
and
Hot
Pie
almost
shit
themselves
when
she
stepped
out
of
the
trees
behind
them.
вЂњQuiet,вЂќ
she
told
them,
putting
an
arm
around
Weasel
when
the
little
girl
came
running
up.

Hot
Pie
stared
at
her
with
big
eyes.
вЂњWe
thought
you
left
us.вЂќ
He
had
his
shortsword
in
hand,
the
one
Yoren
had
taken
off
the
gold
cloak.
вЂњI
was
scared
you
was
a
wolf.вЂќ

вЂњWhereвЂ™s
the
Bull?вЂќ
asked
Lommy.

вЂњThey
caught
him,вЂќ
Arya
whispered.
вЂњWe
have
to
get
him
out.
Hot
Pie,
you
got
to
help.
WeвЂ™ll
sneak
up
and
kill
the
guards,
and
then
IвЂ™ll
open
the
door.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
and
Lommy
exchanged
a
look.
вЂњHow
many?вЂќ

вЂњI
couldnвЂ™t
count,вЂќ
Arya
admitted.
вЂњTwenty
at
least,
but
only
two
on
the
door.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
cry.
вЂњWe
canвЂ™t
fight
twenty.вЂќ

вЂњYou
only
need
to
fight
one.
IвЂ™ll
do
the
other
and
weвЂ™ll
get
Gendry
out
and
run.вЂќ

вЂњWe
should
yield,вЂќ
Lommy
said.
вЂњJust
go
in
and
yield.вЂќ

Arya
shook
her
head
stubbornly.

вЂњThen
just
leave
him,
Arry,вЂќ
Lommy
pleaded.
вЂњThey
donвЂ™t
know
about
the
rest
of
us.
If
we
hide,
theyвЂ™ll
go
away,
you
know
they
will.
ItвЂ™s
not
our
fault
GendryвЂ™s
captured.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
stupid,
Lommy,вЂќ
Arya
said
angrily.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
die
if
we
donвЂ™t
get
Gendry
out.
WhoвЂ™s
going
to
carry
you?вЂќ

вЂњYou
and
Hot
Pie.вЂќ

вЂњAll
the
time,
with
no
one
else
to
help?
WeвЂ™ll
never
do
it.
Gendry
was
the
strong
one.
Anyhow,
I
donвЂ™t
care
what
you
say,
IвЂ™m
going
back
for
him.вЂќ
She
looked
at
Hot
Pie.
вЂњAre
you
coming?вЂќ

Hot
Pie
glanced
at
Lommy,
at
Arya,
at
Lommy
again.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
come,вЂќ
he
said
reluctantly.

вЂњLommy,
you
keep
Weasel
here.вЂќ

He
grabbed
the
little
girl
by
the
hand
and
pulled
her
close.
вЂњWhat
if
the
wolves
come?вЂќ

вЂњYield,вЂќ
Arya
suggested.

Finding
their
way
back
to
the
village
seemed
to
take
hours.
Hot
Pie
kept
stumbling
in
the
dark
and
losing
his
way,
and
Arya
had
to
wait
for
him
and
double
back.
Finally
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
along
through
the
trees.
вЂњJust
be
quiet
and
follow.вЂќ
When
they
could
make
out
the
first
faint
glow
of
the
village
fires
against
the
sky,
she
said,
вЂњThereвЂ™s
dead
men
hanging
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge,
but
theyвЂ™re
nothing
to
be
scared
of,
just
remember
fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
We
have
to
go
real
quiet
and
slow.вЂќ
Hot
Pie
nodded.

She
wriggled
under
the
briar
first
and
waited
for
him
on
the
far
side,
crouched
low.
Hot
Pie
emerged
pale
and
panting,
face
and
arms
bloody
with
long
scratches.
He
started
to
say
something,
but
Arya
put
a
finger
to
his
lips.
On
hands
and
knees,
they
crawled
along
the
gibbet,
beneath
the
swaying
dead.
Hot
Pie
never
once
looked
up,
nor
made
a
sound.

Until
the
crow
landed
on
his
back,
and
he
gave
a
muffled
gasp.
вЂњWhoвЂ™s
there?вЂќ
a
voice
boomed
suddenly
from
the
dark.

Hot
Pie
leapt
to
his
feet.
вЂњI
yield!вЂќ
He
threw
away
his
sword
as
dozens
of
crows
rose
shrieking
and
complaining
to
flap
about
the
corpses.
Arya
grabbed
his
leg
and
tried
to
drag
him
back
down,
but
he
wrenched
loose
and
ran
forward,
waving
his
arms.
вЂњI
yield,
I
yield.вЂќ

She
bounced
up
and
drew
Needle,
but
by
then
men
were
all
around
her.
Arya
slashed
at
the
nearest,
but
he
blocked
her
with
a
steel-clad
arm,
and
someone
else
slammed
into
her
and
dragged
her
to
the
ground,
and
a
third
man
wrenched
the
sword
from
her
grasp.
When
she
tried
to
bite,
her
teeth
snapped
shut
on
cold
dirty
chainmail.
вЂњOho,
a
fierce
one,вЂќ
the
man
said,
laughing.
The
blow
from
his
iron-clad
fist
near
knocked
her
head
off.

They
talked
over
her
as
she
lay
hurting,
but
Arya
could
not
seem
to
understand
the
words.
Her
ears
rang.
When
she
tried
to
crawl
off,
the
earth
moved
beneath
her.
They
took
Needle.
The
shame
of
that
hurt
worse
than
the
pain,
and
the
pain
hurt
a
lot.
Jon
had
given
her
that
sword.
Syrio
had
taught
her
to
use
it.

Finally
someone
grabbed
the
front
of
her
jerkin,
yanked
her
to
her
knees.
Hot
Pie
was
kneeling
too,
before
the
tallest
man
Arya
had
ever
seen,
a
monster
from
one
of
Old
NanвЂ™s
stories.
She
never
saw
where
the
giant
had
come
from.
Three
black
dogs
raced
across
his
faded
yellow
surcoat,
and
his
face
looked
as
hard
as
if
it
had
been
cut
from
stone.
Suddenly
Arya
knew
where
she
had
seen
those
dogs
before.
The
night
of
the
tourney
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
all
the
knights
had
hung
their
shields
outside
their
pavilions.
вЂњThat
one
belongs
to
the
HoundвЂ™s
brother,вЂќ
Sansa
had
confided
when
they
passed
the
black
dogs
on
the
yellow
field.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
even
bigger
than
Hodor,
youвЂ™ll
see.
They
call
him
the
Mountain
That
Rides.вЂќ

Arya
let
her
head
droop,
only
half
aware
of
what
was
going
on
around
her.
Hot
Pie
was
yielding
some
more.
The
Mountain
said,
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
lead
us
to
these
others,вЂќ
and
walked
off.
Next
she
was
stumbling
past
the
dead
men
on
their
gibbet,
while
Hot
Pie
told
their
captors
heвЂ™d
bake
them
pies
and
tarts
if
they
didnвЂ™t
hurt
him.
Four
men
went
with
them.
One
carried
a
torch,
one
a
longsword;
two
had
spears.

They
found
Lommy
where
theyвЂ™d
left
him,
under
the
oak.
вЂњI
yield,вЂќ
he
called
out
at
once
when
he
saw
them.
HeвЂ™d
flung
away
his
own
spear
and
raised
his
hands,
splotchy
green
with
old
dye.
вЂњI
yield.
Please.вЂќ

The
man
with
the
torch
searched
around
under
the
trees.
вЂњAre
you
the
last?
Baker
boy
said
there
was
a
girl.вЂќ

вЂњShe
ran
off
when
she
heard
you
coming,вЂќ
Lommy
said.
вЂњYou
made
a
lot
of
noise.вЂќ
And
Arya
thought,
Run,
Weasel,
run
as
far
as
you
can,
run
and
hide
and
never
come
back.

вЂњTell
us
where
we
can
find
that
whoreson
Dondarrion,
and
thereвЂ™ll
be
a
hot
meal
in
it
for
you.вЂќ

вЂњWho?вЂќ
said
Lommy
blankly.

вЂњI
told
you,
this
lot
donвЂ™t
know
no
more
than
those
cunts
in
the
village.
Waste
oвЂ™bloody
time.вЂќ

One
of
the
spearmen
drifted
over
to
Lommy.
вЂњSomething
wrong
with
your
leg,
boy?вЂќ

вЂњIt
got
hurt.вЂќ

вЂњCan
you
walk?вЂќ
He
sounded
concerned.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
said
Lommy.
вЂњYou
got
to
carry
me.вЂќ

вЂњThink
so?вЂќ
The
man
lifted
his
spear
casually
and
drove
the
point
through
the
boyвЂ™s
soft
throat.
Lommy
never
even
had
time
to
yield
again.
He
jerked
once,
and
that
was
all.
When
the
man
pulled
his
spear
loose,
blood
sprayed
out
in
a
dark
fountain.
вЂњCarry
him,
he
says,вЂќ
he
muttered,
chuckling.





TYRION

They
had
warned
him
to
dress
warmly.
Tyrion
Lannister
took
them
at
their
word.
He
was
garbed
in
heavy
quilted
breeches
and
a
woolen
doublet,
and
over
it
all
he
had
thrown
the
shadowskin
cloak
he
had
acquired
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
The
cloak
was
absurdly
long,
made
for
a
man
twice
his
height.
When
he
was
not
ahorse,
the
only
way
to
wear
the
thing
was
to
wrap
it
around
him
several
times,
which
made
him
look
like
a
ball
of
striped
fur.

Even
so,
he
was
glad
he
had
listened.
The
chill
in
the
long
dank
vault
went
bone
deep.
Timett
had
chosen
to
retreat
back
up
to
the
cellar
after
a
brief
taste
of
the
cold
below.
They
were
somewhere
under
the
hill
of
Rhaenys,
behind
the
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists.
The
damp
stone
walls
were
splotchy
with
nitre,
and
the
only
light
came
from
the
sealed
iron-and-glass
oil
lamp
that
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
carried
so
gingerly.

Gingerly
indeedвЂ¦
and
these
would
be
the
ginger
jars.
Tyrion
lifted
one
for
inspection.
It
was
round
and
ruddy,
a
fat
clay
grapefruit.
A
little
big
for
his
hand,
but
it
would
fit
comfortably
in
the
grip
of
a
normal
man,
he
knew.
The
pottery
was
thin,
so
fragile
that
even
he
had
been
warned
not
to
squeeze
too
tightly,
lest
he
crush
it
in
his
fist.
The
clay
felt
roughened,
pebbled.
Hallyne
told
him
that
was
intentional.
вЂњA
smooth
pot
is
more
apt
to
slip
from
a
manвЂ™s
grasp.вЂќ

The
wildfire
oozed
slowly
toward
the
lip
of
the
jar
when
Tyrion
tilted
it
to
peer
inside.
The
color
would
be
a
murky
green,
he
knew,
but
the
poor
light
made
that
impossible
to
confirm.
вЂњThick,вЂќ
he
observed.

вЂњThat
is
from
the
cold,
my
lord,вЂќ
said
Hallyne,
a
pallid
man
with
soft
damp
hands
and
an
obsequious
manner.
He
was
dressed
in
striped
black-and-scarlet
robes
trimmed
with
sable,
but
the
fur
looked
more
than
a
little
patchy
and
moth-eaten.
вЂњAs
it
warms,
the
substance
will
flow
more
easily,
like
lamp
oil.вЂќ

The
substance
was
the
pyromancersвЂ™
own
term
for
wildfire.
They
called
each
other
wisdom
as
well,
which
Tyrion
found
almost
as
annoying
as
their
custom
of
hinting
at
the
vast
secret
stores
of
knowledge
that
they
wanted
him
to
think
they
possessed.
Once
theirs
had
been
a
powerful
guild,
but
in
recent
centuries
the
maesters
of
the
Citadel
had
supplanted
the
alchemists
almost
everywhere.
Now
only
a
few
of
the
older
order
remained,
and
they
no
longer
even
pretended
to
transmute
metalsвЂ¦

вЂ¦but
they
could
make
wildfire.
вЂњWater
will
not
quench
it,
I
am
told.вЂќ

вЂњThat
is
so.
Once
it
takes
fire,
the
substance
will
burn
fiercely
until
it
is
no
more.
More,
it
will
seep
into
cloth,
wood,
leather,
even
steel,
so
they
take
fire
as
well.вЂќ

Tyrion
remembered
the
red
priest
Thoros
of
Myr
and
his
flaming
sword.
Even
a
thin
coating
of
wildfire
could
burn
for
an
hour.
Thoros
always
needed
a
new
sword
after
a
melee,
but
Robert
had
been
fond
of
the
man
and
ever
glad
to
provide
one.
вЂњWhy
doesnвЂ™t
it
seep
into
the
clay
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
but
it
does,вЂќ
said
Hallyne.
вЂњThere
is
a
vault
below
this
one
where
we
store
the
older
pots.
Those
from
King
AerysвЂ™s
day.
It
was
his
fancy
to
have
the
jars
made
in
the
shapes
of
fruits.
Very
perilous
fruits
indeed,
my
lord
Hand,
and,
hmmm,
riper
now
than
ever,
if
you
take
my
meaning.
We
have
sealed
them
with
wax
and
pumped
the
lower
vault
full
of
water,
but
even
soвЂ¦
by
rights
they
ought
to
have
been
destroyed,
but
so
many
of
our
masters
were
murdered
during
the
Sack
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
the
few
acolytes
who
remained
were
unequal
to
the
task.
And
much
of
the
stock
we
made
for
Aerys
was
lost.
Only
last
year,
two
hundred
jars
were
discovered
in
a
storeroom
beneath
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
No
one
could
recall
how
they
came
there,
but
IвЂ™m
sure
I
do
not
need
to
tell
you
that
the
High
Septon
was
beside
himself
with
terror.
I
myself
saw
that
they
were
safely
moved.
I
had
a
cart
filled
with
sand,
and
sent
our
most
able
acolytes.
We
worked
only
by
night,
weвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”did
a
splendid
job,
I
have
no
doubt.вЂќ
Tyrion
placed
the
jar
heвЂ™d
been
holding
back
among
its
fellows.
They
covered
the
table,
standing
in
orderly
rows
of
four
and
marching
away
into
the
subterranean
dimness.
And
there
were
other
tables
beyond,
many
other
tables.
вЂњThese,
ah,
fruits
of
the
late
King
Aerys,
can
they
still
be
used?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
yes,
most
certainlyвЂ¦
but
carefully,
my
lord,
ever
so
carefully.
As
it
ages,
the
substance
grows
ever
more,
hmmmm,
fickle,
let
us
say.
Any
flame
will
set
it
afire.
Any
spark.
Too
much
heat
and
jars
will
blaze
up
of
their
own
accord.
It
is
not
wise
to
let
them
sit
in
sunlight,
even
for
a
short
time.
Once
the
fire
begins
within,
the
heat
causes
the
substance
to
expand
violently,
and
the
jars
shortly
fly
to
pieces.
If
other
jars
should
happen
to
be
stored
in
the
same
vicinity,
those
go
up
as
well,
and
soвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHow
many
jars
do
you
have
at
present?вЂќ

вЂњThis
morning
the
Wisdom
Munciter
told
me
that
we
had
seven
thousand
eight
hundred
and
forty.
That
count
includes
four
thousand
jars
from
King
AerysвЂ™s
day,
to
be
sure.вЂќ

вЂњOur
overripe
fruits?вЂќ

Hallyne
bobbed
his
head.
вЂњWisdom
Malliard
believes
we
shall
be
able
to
provide
a
full
ten
thousand
jars,
as
was
promised
the
queen.
I
concur.вЂќ
The
pyromancer
looked
indecently
pleased
with
that
prospect.

Assuming
our
enemies
give
you
the
time.
The
pyromancers
kept
their
recipe
for
wildfire
a
closely
guarded
secret,
but
Tyrion
knew
that
it
was
a
lengthy,
dangerous,
and
time-consuming
process.
He
had
assumed
the
promise
of
ten
thousand
jars
was
a
wild
boast,
like
that
of
the
bannerman
who
vows
to
marshal
ten
thousand
swords
for
his
lord
and
shows
up
on
the
day
of
battle
with
a
hundred
and
two.
If
they
can
truly
give
us
ten
thousandвЂ¦

He
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
be
delighted
or
terrified.
Perhaps
a
smidge
of
both.
вЂњI
trust
that
your
guild
brothers
are
not
engaging
in
any
unseemly
haste,
Wisdom.
We
do
not
want
ten
thousand
jars
of
defective
wildfire,
nor
even
oneвЂ¦
and
we
most
certainly
do
not
want
any
mishaps.вЂќ

вЂњThere
will
be
no
mishaps,
my
lord
Hand.
The
substance
is
prepared
by
trained
acolytes
in
a
series
of
bare
stone
cells,
and
each
jar
is
removed
by
an
apprentice
and
carried
down
here
the
instant
it
is
ready.
Above
each
work
cell
is
a
room
filled
entirely
with
sand.
A
protective
spell
has
been
laid
on
the
floors,
hmmm,
most
powerful.
Any
fire
in
the
cell
below
causes
the
floors
to
fall
away,
and
the
sand
smothers
the
blaze
at
once.вЂќ

вЂњNot
to
mention
the
careless
acolyte.вЂќ
By
spell
Tyrion
imagined
Hallyne
meant
clever
trick.
He
thought
he
would
like
to
inspect
one
of
these
false-ceilinged
cells
to
see
how
it
worked,
but
this
was
not
the
time.
Perhaps
when
the
war
was
won.

вЂњMy
brethren
are
never
careless,вЂќ
Hallyne
insisted.
вЂњIf
I
may
be,
hmmmm,
frankвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOh,
do.вЂќ

вЂњThe
substance
flows
through
my
veins,
and
lives
in
the
heart
of
every
pyromancer.
We
respect
its
power.
But
the
common
soldier,
hmmmm,
the
crew
of
one
of
the
queenвЂ™s
spitfires,
say,
in
the
unthinking
frenzy
of
battleвЂ¦
any
little
mistake
can
bring
catastrophe.
That
cannot
be
said
too
often.
My
father
often
told
King
Aerys
as
much,
as
his
father
told
old
King
Jaehaerys.вЂќ

вЂњThey
must
have
listened,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњIf
they
had
burned
the
city
down,
someone
would
have
told
me.
So
your
counsel
is
that
we
had
best
be
careful?
вЂњ

вЂњBe
very
careful,вЂќ
said
Hallyne.
вЂњBe
very
very
careful.вЂќ

вЂњThese
clay
jarsвЂ¦
do
you
have
an
ample
supply?вЂќ

вЂњWe
do,
my
lord,
and
thank
you
for
asking.вЂќ

вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
mind
if
I
take
some,
then.
A
few
thousand.вЂќ

вЂњA
few
thousand?вЂќ

вЂњOr
however
many
your
guild
can
spare,
without
interfering
with
production.
ItвЂ™s
empty
pots
IвЂ™m
asking
for,
understand.
Have
them
sent
round
to
the
captains
on
each
of
the
city
gates.вЂќ

вЂњI
will,
my
lord,
but
whyвЂ¦?вЂќ

Tyrion
smiled
up
at
him.
вЂњWhen
you
tell
me
to
dress
warmly,
I
dress
warmly.
When
you
tell
me
to
be
careful,
wellвЂ¦вЂќ
He
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
seen
enough.
Perhaps
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
escort
me
back
up
to
my
litter?вЂќ

вЂњIt
would
be
my
great,
hmmm,
pleasure,
my
lord.вЂќ
Hallyne
lifted
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
stairs.
вЂњIt
was
good
of
you
to
visit
us.
A
great
honor,
hmmm.
It
has
been
too
long
since
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand
graced
us
with
his
presence.
Not
since
Lord
Rossart,
and
he
was
of
our
order.
That
was
back
in
King
AerysвЂ™s
day.
King
Aerys
took
a
great
interest
in
our
work.вЂќ

King
Aerys
used
you
to
roast
the
flesh
off
his
enemies.
His
brother
Jaime
had
told
him
a
few
stories
of
the
Mad
King
and
his
pet
pyromancers.
вЂњJoffrey
will
be
interested
as
well,
I
have
no
doubt.вЂќ
Which
is
why
IвЂ™d
best
keep
him
well
away
from
you.

вЂњIt
is
our
great
hope
to
have
the
king
visit
our
Guildhall
in
his
own
royal
person.
I
have
spoken
of
it
to
your
royal
sister.
A
great
feastвЂ¦вЂќ

It
was
growing
warmer
as
they
climbed.
вЂњHis
Grace
has
prohibited
all
feasting
until
such
time
as
the
war
is
won.вЂќ
At
my
insistence.
вЂњThe
king
does
not
think
it
fitting
to
banquet
on
choice
food
while
his
people
go
without
bread.вЂќ

вЂњA
most,
hmmm,
loving
gesture,
my
lord.
Perhaps
instead
some
few
of
us
might
call
upon
the
king
at
the
Red
Keep.
A
small
demonstration
of
our
powers,
as
it
were,
to
distract
His
Grace
from
his
many
cares
for
an
evening.
Wildfire
is
but
one
of
the
dread
secrets
of
our
ancient
order.
Many
and
wondrous
are
the
things
we
might
show
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
take
it
up
with
my
sister.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
no
objection
to
a
few
magic
tricks,
but
JoffвЂ™s
fondness
for
making
men
fight
to
the
death
was
trial
enough;
he
had
no
intention
of
allowing
the
boy
to
taste
the
possibilities
of
burning
them
alive.

When
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
steps,
Tyrion
shrugged
out
of
his
shadowskin
fur
and
folded
it
over
his
arm.
The
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists
was
an
imposing
warren
of
black
stone,
but
Hallyne
led
him
through
the
twists
and
turns
until
they
reached
the
Gallery
of
the
Iron
Torches,
a
long
echoing
chamber
where
columns
of
green
fire
danced
around
black
metal
columns
twenty
feet
tall.
Ghostly
flames
shimmered
off
the
polished
black
marble
of
the
walls
and
floor
and
bathed
the
hall
in
an
emerald
radiance.
Tyrion
would
have
been
more
impressed
if
he
hadnвЂ™t
known
that
the
great
iron
torches
had
only
been
lit
this
morning
in
honor
of
his
visit,
and
would
be
extinguished
the
instant
the
doors
closed
behind
him.
Wildfire
was
too
costly
to
squander.

They
emerged
atop
the
broad
curving
steps
that
fronted
on
the
Street
of
the
Sisters,
near
the
foot
of
VisenyaвЂ™s
Hill.
He
bid
Hallyne
farewell
and
waddled
down
to
where
Timett
son
of
Timett
waited
with
an
escort
of
Burned
Men.
Given
his
purpose
today,
it
had
seemed
a
singularly
appropriate
choice
for
his
guard.
Besides,
their
scars
struck
terror
in
the
hearts
of
the
city
rabble.
That
was
all
to
the
good
these
days.
Only
three
nights
past,
another
mob
had
gathered
at
the
gates
of
the
Red
Keep,
chanting
for
food.
Joff
had
unleashed
a
storm
of
arrows
against
them,
slaying
four,
and
then
shouted
down
that
they
had
his
leave
to
eat
their
dead.
Winning
us
still
more
friends.

Tyrion
was
surprised
to
see
Bronn
standing
beside
the
litter
as
well.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing
here?вЂќ

вЂњDelivering
your
messages,вЂќ
Bronn
said.
вЂњIronhand
wants
you
urgently
at
the
Gate
of
the
Gods.
He
wonвЂ™t
say
why.
And
youвЂ™ve
been
summoned
to
MaegorвЂ™s
too.вЂќ

вЂњSummoned?вЂќ
Tyrion
knew
of
only
one
person
who
would
presume
to
use
that
word.
вЂњAnd
what
does
Cersei
want
of
me?вЂќ

Bronn
shrugged.
вЂњThe
queen
commands
you
to
return
to
the
castle
at
once
and
attend
her
in
her
chambers.
That
stripling
cousin
of
yours
delivered
the
message.
Four
hairs
on
his
lip
and
he
thinks
heвЂ™s
a
man.вЂќ

вЂњFour
hairs
and
a
knighthood.
HeвЂ™s
Ser
Lancel
now,
never
forget.вЂќ
Tyrion
knew
that
Ser
Jacelyn
would
not
send
for
him
unless
the
matter
was
of
import.
вЂњIвЂ™d
best
see
what
Bywater
wants.
Inform
my
sister
that
I
will
attend
her
on
my
return.вЂќ

вЂњShe
wonвЂ™t
like
that,вЂќ
Bronn
warned.

вЂњGood.
The
longer
Cersei
waits,
the
angrier
sheвЂ™ll
become,
and
anger
makes
her
stupid.
I
much
prefer
angry
and
stupid
to
composed
and
cunning.вЂќ
Tyrion
tossed
his
folded
cloak
into
his
litter,
and
Timett
helped
him
up
after
it.

The
market
square
inside
the
Gate
of
the
Gods,
which
in
normal
times
would
have
been
thronged
with
farmers
selling
vegetables,
was
near
deserted
when
Tyrion
crossed
it.
Ser
Jacelyn
met
him
at
the
gate,
and
raised
his
iron
hand
in
brusque
salute.
вЂњMy
lord.
Your
cousin
Cleos
Frey
is
here,
come
from
Riverrun
under
a
peace
banner
with
a
letter
from
Robb
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњPeace
terms?вЂќ

вЂњSo
he
says.вЂќ

вЂњSweet
cousin.
Show
me
to
him.вЂќ

The
gold
cloaks
had
confined
Ser
Cleos
to
a
windowless
guardroom
in
the
gatehouse.
He
rose
when
they
entered.
вЂњTyrion,
you
are
a
most
welcome
sight.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
not
something
I
hear
often,
cousin.вЂќ

вЂњHas
Cersei
come
with
you?вЂќ

вЂњMy
sister
is
otherwise
occupied.
Is
this
StarkвЂ™s
letter?вЂќ
He
plucked
it
off
the
table.
вЂњSer
Jacelyn,
you
may
leave
us.вЂќ

Bywater
bowed
and
departed.
вЂњI
was
asked
to
bring
the
offer
to
the
Queen
Regent,вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
said
as
the
door
shut.

вЂњI
shall.вЂќ
Tyrion
glanced
over
the
map
that
Robb
Stark
had
sent
with
his
letter.
вЂњAll
in
good
time,
cousin.
Sit.
Rest.
You
look
gaunt
and
haggard.вЂќ
He
looked
worse
than
that,
in
truth.

вЂњYes.вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
lowered
himself
onto
a
bench.
вЂњIt
is
bad
in
the
riverlands,
Tyrion.
Around
the
Gods
Eye
and
along
the
kingsroad
especially.
The
river
lords
are
burning
their
own
crops
to
try
and
starve
us,
and
your
fatherвЂ™s
foragers
are
torching
every
village
they
take
and
putting
the
smallfolk
to
the
sword.вЂќ

That
was
the
way
of
war.
The
smallfolk
were
slaughtered,
while
the
highborn
were
held
for
ransom.
Remind
me
to
thank
the
gods
that
I
was
bom
a
Lannister.

Ser
Cleos
ran
a
hand
through
his
thin
brown
hair.
вЂњEven
with
a
peace
banner,
we
were
attacked
twice.
Wolves
in
mail,
hungry
to
savage
anyone
weaker
than
themselves.
The
gods
alone
know
what
side
they
started
on,
but
theyвЂ™re
on
their
own
side
now.
Lost
three
men,
and
twice
as
many
wounded.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
news
of
our
foe?вЂќ
Tyrion
turned
his
attention
back
to
StarkвЂ™s
terms.
The
boy
does
not
want
too
much.
Only
half
the
realm,
the
release
of
our
captives,
hostages,
his
fatherвЂ™s
swordвЂ¦
oh,
yes,
and
his
sisters.

вЂњThe
boy
sits
idle
at
Riverrun,вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
said.
вЂњI
think
he
fears
to
face
your
father
in
the
field.
His
strength
grows
less
each
day.
The
river
lords
have
departed,
each
to
defend
his
own
lands.вЂќ

Is
this
what
Father
intended?
Tyrion
rolled
up
StarkвЂ™s
map.
вЂњThese
terms
will
never
do.вЂќ

вЂњWill
you
at
least
consent
to
trade
the
Stark
girls
for
Tion
and
Willem?вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
asked
plaintively.

Tion
Frey
was
his
younger
brother,
Tyrion
recalled.
вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
said
gently,
вЂњbut
weвЂ™ll
propose
our
own
exchange
of
captives.
Let
me
consult
with
Cersei
and
the
council.
We
shall
send
you
back
to
Riverrun
with
our
terms.вЂќ

Clearly,
the
prospect
did
not
cheer
him.
вЂњMy
lord,
I
do
not
believe
Robb
Stark
will
yield
easily.
It
is
Lady
Catelyn
who
wants
this
peace,
not
the
boy.вЂќ

вЂњLady
Catelyn
wants
her
daughters.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
himself
down
from
the
bench,
letter
and
map
in
hand.
вЂњSer
Jacelyn
will
see
that
you
have
food
and
fire.
You
look
in
dire
need
of
sleep,
cousin.
I
will
send
for
you
when
we
know
more.вЂќ

He
found
Ser
Jacelyn
on
the
ramparts,
watching
several
hundred
new
recruits
drilling
in
the
field
below.
With
so
many
seeking
refuge
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
there
was
no
lack
of
men
willing
to
join
the
City
Watch
for
a
full
belly
and
a
bed
of
straw
in
the
barracks,
but
Tyrion
had
no
illusions
about
how
well
these
ragged
defenders
of
theirs
would
fight
if
it
came
to
battle.

вЂњYou
did
well
to
send
for
me,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњI
shall
leave
Ser
Cleos
in
your
hands.
He
is
to
have
every
hospitality.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
his
escort?вЂќ
the
commander
wanted
to
know.

вЂњGive
them
food
and
clean
garb,
and
find
a
maester
to
see
to
their
hurts.
They
are
not
to
set
foot
inside
the
city,
is
that
understood?вЂќ
It
would
never
do
to
have
the
truth
of
conditions
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
reach
Robb
Stark
in
Riverrun.

вЂњWell
understood,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
and
one
more
thing.
The
alchemists
will
be
sending
a
large
supply
of
clay
pots
to
each
of
the
city
gates.
YouвЂ™re
to
use
them
to
train
the
men
who
will
work
your
spitfires.
Fill
the
pots
with
green
paint
and
have
them
drill
at
loading
and
firing.
Any
man
who
spatters
should
be
replaced.
When
they
have
mastered
the
paint
pots,
substitute
lamp
oil
and
have
them
work
at
lighting
the
jars
and
firing
them
while
aflame.
Once
they
learn
to
do
that
without
burning
themselves,
they
may
be
ready
for
wildfire.вЂќ

Ser
Jacelyn
scratched
at
his
cheek
with
his
iron
hand.
вЂњWise
measures.
Though
I
have
no
love
for
that
alchemistвЂ™s
piss.вЂќ

вЂњNor
I,
but
I
use
what
IвЂ™m
given.вЂќ

Once
back
inside
his
litter,
Tyrion
Lannister
drew
the
curtains
and
plumped
a
cushion
under
his
elbow.
Cersei
would
be
displeased
to
learn
that
he
had
intercepted
StarkвЂ™s
letter,
but
his
father
had
sent
him
here
to
rule,
not
to
please
Cersei.

It
seemed
to
him
that
Robb
Stark
had
given
them
a
golden
chance.
Let
the
boy
wait
at
Riverrun
dreaming
of
an
easy
peace.
Tyrion
would
reply
with
terms
of
his
own,
giving
the
King
in
the
North
just
enough
of
what
he
wanted
to
keep
him
hopeful.
Let
Ser
Cleos
wear
out
his
bony
Frey
rump
riding
to
and
fro
with
offers
and
counters.
All
the
while,
their
cousin
Ser
Stafford
would
be
training
and
arming
the
new
host
heвЂ™d
raised
at
Casterly
Rock.
Once
he
was
ready,
he
and
Lord
Tywin
could
smash
the
Tullys
and
Starks
between
them.

Now
if
only
RobertвЂ™s
brothers
would
be
so
accommodating.
Glacial
as
his
progress
was,
still
Renly
Baratheon
crept
north
and
east
with
his
huge
southron
host,
and
scarcely
a
night
passed
that
Tyrion
did
not
dread
being
awakened
with
the
news
that
Lord
Stannis
was
sailing
his
fleet
up
the
Blackwater
Rush.
Well,
it
would
seem
I
have
a
goodly
stock
of
wildfire,
but
stillвЂ¦

The
sound
of
some
hubbub
in
the
street
intruded
on
his
worries.
Tyrion
peered
out
cautiously
between
the
curtains.
They
were
passing
through
CobblerвЂ™s
Square,
where
a
sizable
crowd
had
gathered
beneath
the
leather
awnings
to
listen
to
the
rantings
of
a
prophet.
A
robe
of
undyed
wool
belted
with
a
hempen
rope
marked
him
for
one
of
the
begging
brothers.

вЂњCorruption!вЂќ
the
man
cried
shrilly.
вЂњThere
is
the
warning!
Behold
the
FatherвЂ™s
scourge!вЂќ
He
pointed
at
the
fuzzy
red
wound
in
the
sky.
From
this
vantage,
the
distant
castle
on
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill
was
directly
behind
him,
with
the
comet
hanging
forebodingly
over
its
towers.
A
clever
choice
of
stage,
Tyrion
reflected.
вЂњWe
have
become
swollen,
bloated,
foul.
Brother
couples
with
sister
in
the
bed
of
kings,
and
the
fruit
of
their
incest
capers
in
his
palace
to
the
piping
of
a
twisted
little
monkey
demon.
Highborn
ladies
fornicate
with
fools
and
give
birth
to
monsters!
Even
the
High
Septon
has
forgotten
the
gods!
He
bathes
in
scented
waters
and
grows
fat
on
lark
and
lamprey
while
his
people
starve!
Pride
comes
before
prayer,
maggots
rule
our
castles,
and
gold
is
allвЂ¦
but
no
more!
The
Rotten
Summer
is
at
an
end,
and
the
Whoremonger
King
is
brought
low!
When
the
boar
did
open
him,
a
great
stench
rose
to
heaven
and
a
thousand
snakes
slid
forth
from
his
belly,
hissing
and
biting!вЂќ
He
jabbed
his
bony
finger
back
at
comet
and
castle.
вЂњThere
comes
the
Harbinger!
Cleanse
yourselves,
the
gods
cry
out,
lest
ye
be
cleansed!
Bathe
in
the
wine
of
righteousness,
or
you
shall
be
bathed
in
fire!
Fire!вЂќ

вЂњFire!вЂќ
other
voices
echoed,
but
the
hoots
of
derision
almost
drowned
them
out.
Tyrion
took
solace
from
that.
He
gave
the
command
to
continue,
and
the
litter
rocked
like
a
ship
on
a
rough
sea
as
the
Burned
Men
cleared
a
path.
Twisted
little
monkey
demon
indeed.
The
wretch
did
have
a
point
about
the
High
Septon,
to
be
sure.
What
was
it
that
Moon
Boy
had
said
of
him
the
other
day?
A
pious
man
who
worships
the
Seven
so
fervently
that
he
eats
a
meal
for
each
of
them
whenever
he
sits
to
table.
The
memory
of
the
foolвЂ™s
jape
made
Tyrion
smile.

He
was
pleased
to
reach
the
Red
Keep
without
further
incident.
As
he
climbed
the
steps
to
his
chambers,
Tyrion
felt
a
deal
more
hopeful
than
he
had
at
dawn.
Time,
thatвЂ™s
all
I
truly
need,
time
to
piece
it
all
together.
Once
the
chain
is
doneвЂ¦
He
opened
the
door
to
his
solar.

Cersei
turned
away
from
the
window,
her
skirts
swirling
around
her
slender
hips.
вЂњHow
dare
you
ignore
my
summons!вЂќ

вЂњWho
admitted
you
to
my
tower?вЂќ

вЂњYour
tower?
This
is
my
sonвЂ™s
royal
castle.вЂќ

вЂњSo
they
tell
me.вЂќ
Tyrion
was
not
amused.
Crawn
would
be
even
less
so;
his
Moon
Brothers
had
the
guard
today.
вЂњI
was
about
to
come
to
you,
as
it
happens.вЂќ

вЂњWere
you?вЂќ

He
swung
the
door
shut
behind
him.
вЂњYou
doubt
me?вЂќ

вЂњAlways,
and
with
good
reason.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
hurt.вЂќ
Tyrion
waddled
to
the
sideboard
for
a
cup
of
wine.
He
knew
no
surer
way
to
work
up
a
thirst
than
talking
with
Cersei.
вЂњIf
IвЂ™ve
given
you
offense,
I
would
know
how.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
a
disgusting
little
worm
you
are.
Myrcella
is
my
only
daughter.
Did
you
truly
imagine
that
I
would
allow
you
to
sell
her
like
a
bag
of
oats?
вЂњ

Myrcella,
he
thought.
Well,
that
egg
has
hatched.
LetвЂ™s
see
what
color
the
chick
is.
вЂњHardly
a
bag
of
oats.
Myrcella
is
a
princess.
Some
would
say
this
is
what
she
was
born
for.
Or
did
you
plan
to
marry
her
to
Tommen?вЂќ

Her
hand
lashed
out,
knocking
the
wine
cup
from
his
hand
to
spill
on
the
floor.
вЂњBrother
or
no,
I
should
have
your
tongue
out
for
that.
I
am
JoffreyвЂ™s
regent,
not
you,
and
I
say
that
Myrcella
will
not
be
shipped
off
to
this
Dornishman
the
way
I
was
shipped
to
Robert
Baratheon.вЂќ

Tyrion
shook
wine
off
his
fingers
and
sighed.
вЂњWhy
not?
SheвЂ™d
be
a
deal
safer
in
Dorne
than
she
is
here.вЂќ

вЂњAre
you
utterly
ignorant
or
simply
perverse?
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
the
Martells
have
no
cause
to
love
us.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Martells
have
every
cause
to
hate
us.
Nonetheless,
I
expect
them
to
agree.
Prince
DoranвЂ™s
grievance
against
House
Lannister
goes
back
only
a
generation,
but
the
Dornishmen
have
warred
against
StormвЂ™s
End
and
Highgarden
for
a
thousand
years,
and
Renly
has
taken
DorneвЂ™s
allegiance
for
granted.
Myrcella
is
nine,
Trystane
Martell
eleven.
I
have
proposed
they
wed
when
she
reaches
her
fourteenth
year.
Until
such
time,
she
would
be
an
honored
guest
at
Sunspear,
under
Prince
DoranвЂ™s
protection.вЂќ

вЂњA
hostage,вЂќ
Cersei
said,
mouth
tightening.

вЂњAn
honored
guest,вЂќ
Tyrion
insisted,
вЂњand
I
suspect
Martell
will
treat
Myrcella
more
kindly
than
Joffrey
has
treated
Sansa
Stark.
I
had
in
mind
to
send
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
with
her.
With
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
as
her
sworn
shield,
no
one
is
like
to
forget
who
or
what
she
is.вЂќ

вЂњSmall
good
Ser
Arys
will
do
her
if
Doran
Martell
decides
that
my
daughterвЂ™s
death
would
wash
out
his
sisterвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњMartell
is
too
honorable
to
murder
a
nine-year-old
girl,
particularly
one
as
sweet
and
innocent
as
Myrcella.
So
long
as
he
holds
her
he
can
be
reasonably
certain
that
weвЂ™ll
keep
faith
on
our
side,
and
the
terms
are
too
rich
to
refuse.
Myrcella
is
the
least
part
of
it.
IвЂ™ve
also
offered
him
his
sisterвЂ™s
killer,
a
council
seat,
some
castles
on
the
MarchesвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњToo
much.вЂќ
Cersei
paced
away
from
him,
restless
as
a
lioness,
skirts
swirling.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
offered
too
much,
and
without
my
authority
or
consent.вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
the
Prince
of
Dorne
we
are
speaking
of.
If
IвЂ™d
offered
less,
heвЂ™d
likely
spit
in
my
face.вЂќ

вЂњToo
much!вЂќ
Cersei
insisted,
whirling
back.

вЂњWhat
would
you
have
offered
him,
that
hole
between
your
legs?вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
his
own
anger
flaring.

This
time
he
saw
the
slap
coming.
His
head
snapped
around
with
a
crack.
вЂњSweet
sweet
sister,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњI
promise
you,
that
was
the
last
time
you
will
ever
strike
me.вЂќ

His
sister
laughed.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
threaten
me,
little
man.
Do
you
think
FatherвЂ™s
letter
keeps
you
safe?
A
piece
of
paper.
Eddard
Stark
had
a
piece
of
paper
too,
for
all
the
good
it
did
him.вЂќ

Eddard
Stark
did
not
have
the
City
Watch,
Tyrion
thought,
nor
my
clansmen,
nor
the
sellswords
that
Bronn
has
hired.
I
do.
Or
so
he
hoped.
Trusting
in
Varys,
in
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater,
in
Bronn.
Lord
Stark
had
probably
had
his
delusions
as
well.

Yet
he
said
nothing.
A
wise
man
did
not
pour
wildfire
on
a
brazier.
Instead
he
poured
a
fresh
cup
of
wine.
вЂњHow
safe
do
you
think
Myrcella
will
be
if
KingвЂ™s
Landing
falls?
Renly
and
Stannis
will
mount
her
head
beside
yours.вЂќ

And
Cersei
began
to
cry.

Tyrion
Lannister
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
if
Aegon
the
Conqueror
himself
had
burst
into
the
room,
riding
on
a
dragon
and
juggling
lemon
pies.
He
had
not
seen
his
sister
weep
since
they
were
children
together
at
Casterly
Rock.
Awkwardly,
he
took
a
step
toward
her.
When
your
sister
cries,
you
were
supposed
to
comfort
herвЂ¦
but
this
was
Cersei!
He
reached
a
tentative
hand
for
her
shoulder.

вЂњDonвЂ™t
touch
me,вЂќ
she
said,
wrenching
away.
It
should
not
have
hurt,
yet
it
did,
more
than
any
slap.
Red-faced,
as
angry
as
she
was
grief-stricken,
Cersei
struggled
for
breath.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
look
at
me,
notвЂ¦
not
like
thisвЂ¦
not
you.вЂќ

Politely,
Tyrion
turned
his
back.
вЂњI
did
not
mean
to
frighten
you.
I
promise
you,
nothing
will
happen
to
Myrcella.вЂќ

вЂњLiar,вЂќ
she
said
behind
him.
вЂњIвЂ™m
not
a
child,
to
be
soothed
with
empty
promises.
You
told
me
you
would
free
Jaime
too.
Well,
where
is
he?
вЂњ

вЂњIn
Riverrun,
I
should
imagine.
Safe
and
under
guard,
until
I
find
a
way
to
free
him.вЂќ

Cersei
sniffed.
вЂњI
should
have
been
born
a
man.
I
would
have
no
need
of
any
of
you
then.
None
of
this
would
have
been
allowed
to
happen.
How
could
Jaime
let
himself
be
captured
by
that
boy?
And
Father,
I
trusted
in
him,
fool
that
I
am,
but
where
is
he
now
that
heвЂ™s
wanted?
What
is
he
doing?вЂќ

вЂњMaking
war.вЂќ

вЂњFrom
behind
the
walls
of
Harrenhal?вЂќ
she
said
scornfully.
вЂњA
curious
way
of
fighting.
It
looks
suspiciously
like
hiding.вЂќ

вЂњLook
again.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
else
would
you
call
it?
Father
sits
in
one
castle,
and
Robb
Stark
sits
in
another,
and
no
one
does
anything.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
sitting
and
there
is
sitting,вЂќ
Tyrion
suggested.
вЂњEach
one
waits
for
the
other
to
move,
but
the
lion
is
still,
poised,
his
tail
twitching,
while
the
fawn
is
frozen
by
fear,
bowels
turned
to
jelly.
No
matter
which
way
he
bounds,
the
lion
will
have
him,
and
he
knows
it.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
youвЂ™re
quite
certain
that
Father
is
the
lion?вЂќ

Tyrion
grinned.
вЂњItвЂ™s
on
all
our
banners.вЂќ

She
ignored
the
jest.
вЂњIf
it
was
Father
whoвЂ™d
been
taken
captive,
Jaime
would
not
be
sitting
by
idly,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

Jaime
would
be
battering
his
host
to
bloody
bits
against
the
walls
of
Riverrun,
and
the
Others
take
their
chances.
He
never
did
have
any
patience,
no
more
than
you,
sweet
sister.
вЂњNot
all
of
us
can
be
as
bold
as
Jaime,
but
there
are
other
ways
to
win
wars.
Harrenhal
is
strong
and
well
situated.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
KingвЂ™s
Landing
is
not,
as
we
both
know
perfectly
well.
While
Father
plays
lion
and
fawn
with
the
Stark
boy,
Renly
marches
up
the
roseroad.
He
could
be
at
our
gates
any
day
now!вЂќ

вЂњThe
city
will
not
fall
in
a
day.
From
Harrenhal
it
is
a
straight,
swift
march
down
the
kingsroad.
Renly
will
scarce
have
unlimbered
his
siege
engines
before
Father
takes
him
in
the
rear.
His
host
will
be
the
hammer,
the
city
walls
the
anvil.
it
makes
a
lovely
picture.вЂќ

CerseiвЂ™s
green
eyes
bored
into
him,
wary,
yet
hungry
for
the
reassurance
he
was
feeding
her.
вЂњAnd
if
Robb
Stark
marches?вЂќ

вЂњHarrenhal
is
close
enough
to
the
fords
of
the
Trident
so
that
Roose
Bolton
cannot
bring
the
northern
foot
across
to
join
with
the
Young
WolfвЂ™s
horse.
Stark
cannot
march
on
KingвЂ™s
Landing
without
taking
Harrenhal
first,
and
even
with
Bolton
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
do
that.вЂќ
Tyrion
tried
his
most
winning
smile.
вЂњMeanwhile
Father
lives
off
the
fat
of
the
riverlands,
while
our
uncle
Stafford
gathers
fresh
levies
at
the
Rock.вЂќ

Cersei
regarded
him
suspiciously.
вЂњHow
could
you
know
all
this?
Did
Father
tell
you
his
intentions
when
he
sent
you
here?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
I
glanced
at
a
map.вЂќ

Her
look
turned
to
disdain.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
conjured
up
every
word
of
this
in
that
grotesque
head
of
yours,
havenвЂ™t
you,
Imp?вЂќ

Tyrion
tsked.
вЂњSweet
sister,
I
ask
you,
if
we
werenвЂ™t
winning,
would
the
Starks
have
sued
for
peace?вЂќ
He
drew
out
the
letter
that
Ser
Cleos
Frey
had
brought.
вЂњThe
Young
Wolf
has
sent
us
terms,
you
see.
Unacceptable
terms,
to
be
sure,
but
still,
a
beginning.
Would
you
care
to
see
them?вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
That
fast,
she
was
all
queen
again.
вЂњHow
do
you
come
to
have
them?
They
should
have
come
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
else
is
a
Hand
for,
if
not
to
hand
you
things?вЂќ
Tyrion
handed
her
the
letter.
His
cheek
still
throbbed
where
CerseiвЂ™s
hand
had
left
its
mark.
Let
her
flay
half
my
face,
it
will
be
a
small
price
to
pay
for
her
consent
to
the
Dornish
marriage.
He
would
have
that
now,
he
could
sense
it.

And
certain
knowledge
of
an
informer
tooвЂ¦
well,
that
was
the
plum
in
his
pudding.





BRAN

Dancer
was
draped
in
bardings
of
snowy
white
wool
emblazoned
with
the
grey
direwolf
of
House
Stark,
while
Bran
wore
grey
breeches
and
white
doublet,
his
sleeves
and
collar
trimmed
with
vair.
Over
his
heart
was
his
wolfвЂ™s-head
brooch
of
silver
and
polished
jet.
He
would
sooner
have
had
Summer
than
a
silver
wolf
on
his
breast,
but
Ser
Rodrik
had
been
unyielding.

The
low
stone
steps
balked
Dancer
only
for
a
moment.
When
Bran
urged
her
on,
she
took
them
easily.
Beyond
the
wide
oak-and-iron
doors,
eight
long
rows
of
trestle
tables
filled
WinterfellвЂ™s
Great
Hall,
four
on
each
side
of
the
center
aisle.
Men
crowded
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
the
benches.
вЂњStark!вЂќ
they
called
as
Bran
trotted
past,
rising
to
their
feet.
вЂњWinterfell!
Winterfell!вЂќ

He
was
old
enough
to
know
that
it
was
not
truly
him
they
shouted
forвЂ”it
was
the
harvest
they
cheered,
it
was
Robb
and
his
victories,
it
was
his
lord
father
and
his
grandfather
and
all
the
Starks
going
back
eight
thousand
years.
Still,
it
made
him
swell
with
pride.
For
so
long
as
it
took
him
to
ride
the
length
of
that
hall
he
forgot
that
he
was
broken.
Yet
when
he
reached
the
dais,
with
every
eye
upon
him,
Osha
and
Hodor
undid
his
straps
and
buckles,
lifted
him
off
DancerвЂ™s
back,
and
carried
him
to
the
high
seat
of
his
fathers.

Ser
Rodrik
was
seated
to
BranвЂ™s
left,
his
daughter
Beth
beside
him.
Rickon
was
to
his
right,
his
mop
of
shaggy
auburn
hair
grown
so
long
that
it
brushed
his
ermine
mantle.
He
had
refused
to
let
anyone
cut
it
since
their
mother
had
gone.
The
last
girl
to
try
had
been
bitten
for
her
efforts.
вЂњI
wanted
to
ride
too,вЂќ
he
said
as
Hodor
led
Dancer
away.
вЂњI
ride
better
than
you.вЂќ

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t,
so
hush
up,вЂќ
he
told
his
brother.
Ser
Rodrik
bellowed
for
quiet.
Bran
raised
his
voice.
He
bid
them
welcome
in
the
name
of
his
brother,
the
King
in
the
North,
and
asked
them
to
thank
the
gods
old
and
new
for
RobbвЂ™s
victories
and
the
bounty
of
the
harvest.
вЂњMay
there
be
a
hundred
more,вЂќ
he
finished,
raising
his
fatherвЂ™s
silver
goblet.

вЂњA
hundred
more!вЂќ
Pewter
tankards,
clay
cups,
and
iron-banded
drinking
horns
clashed
together.
BranвЂ™s
wine
was
sweetened
with
honey
and
fragrant
with
cinnamon
and
cloves,
but
stronger
than
he
was
used
to.
He
could
feel
its
hot
snaky
fingers
wriggling
through
his
chest
as
he
swallowed.
By
the
time
he
set
down
the
goblet,
his
head
was
swimming.

вЂњYou
did
well,
Bran,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
told
him.
вЂњLord
Eddard
would
have
been
most
proud.вЂќ
Down
the
table,
Maester
Luwin
nodded
his
agreement
as
the
servers
began
to
carry
in
the
food.

Such
food
Bran
had
never
seen;
course
after
course
after
course,
so
much
that
he
could
not
manage
more
than
a
bite
or
two
of
each
dish.
There
were
great
joints
of
aurochs
roasted
with
leeks,
venison
pies
chunky
with
carrots,
bacon,
and
mushrooms,
mutton
chops
sauced
in
honey
and
cloves,
savory
duck,
peppered
boar,
goose,
skewers
of
pigeon
and
capon,
beef-and-barley
stew,
cold
fruit
soup.
Lord
Wyman
had
brought
twenty
casks
of
fish
from
White
Harbor
packed
in
salt
and
seaweed;
whitefish
and
winkles,
crabs
and
mussels,
clams,
herring,
cod,
salmon,
lobster
and
lampreys.
There
was
black
bread
and
honeycakes
and
oaten
biscuits;
there
were
turnips
and
pease
and
beets,
beans
and
squash
and
huge
red
onions;
there
were
baked
apples
and
berry
tarts
and
pears
poached
in
strongwine.
Wheels
of
white
cheese
were
set
at
every
table,
above
and
below
the
salt,
and
flagons
of
hot
spice
wine
and
chilled
autumn
ale
were
passed
up
and
down
the
tables.

Lord
WymanвЂ™s
musicians
played
bravely
and
well,
but
harp
and
fiddle
and
horn
were
soon
drowned
beneath
a
tide
of
talk
and
laughter,
the
clash
of
cup
and
plate,
and
the
snarling
of
hounds
fighting
for
table
scraps.
The
singer
sang
good
songs,
вЂњIron
LancesвЂќ
and
вЂњThe
Burning
of
the
ShipsвЂќ
and
вЂњThe
Bear
and
the
Maiden
Fair,вЂќ
but
only
Hodor
seemed
to
be
listening.
He
stood
beside
the
piper,
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other.

The
noise
swelled
to
a
steady
rumbling
roar,
a
great
heady
stew
of
sound.
Ser
Rodrik
talked
with
Maester
Luwin
above
BethвЂ™s
curly
head,
while
Rickon
screamed
happily
at
the
Walders.
Bran
had
not
wanted
the
Freys
at
the
high
table,
but
the
maester
reminded
him
that
they
would
soon
be
kin.
Robb
was
to
marry
one
of
their
aunts,
and
Arya
one
of
their
uncles.
вЂњShe
never
will,вЂќ
Bran
said,
вЂњnot
Arya,вЂќ
but
Maester
Luwin
was
unyielding,
so
there
they
were
beside
Rickon.

The
serving
men
brought
every
dish
to
Bran
first,
that
he
might
take
the
lordвЂ™s
portion
if
he
chose.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
ducks,
he
could
eat
no
more.
After
that
he
nodded
approval
at
each
course
in
turn,
and
waved
it
away.
If
the
dish
smelled
especially
choice,
he
would
send
it
to
one
of
the
lords
on
the
dais,
a
gesture
of
friendship
and
favor
that
Maester
Luwin
told
him
he
must
make.
He
sent
some
salmon
down
to
poor
sad
Lady
Hornwood,
the
boar
to
the
boisterous
Umbers,
a
dish
of
goose-in-berries
to
Cley
Cerwyn,
and
a
huge
lobster
to
Joseth
the
master
of
horse,
who
was
neither
lord
nor
guest,
but
had
seen
to
DancerвЂ™s
training
and
made
it
possible
for
Bran
to
ride.
He
sent
sweets
to
Hodor
and
Old
Nan
as
well,
for
no
reason
but
he
loved
them.
Ser
Rodrik
reminded
him
to
send
something
to
his
foster
brothers,
so
he
sent
Little
Walder
some
boiled
beets
and
Big
Walder
the
buttered
turnips.

On
the
benches
below,
Winterfell
men
mixed
with
smallfolk
from
the
winter
town,
friends
from
the
nearer
holdfasts,
and
the
escorts
of
their
lordly
guests.
Some
faces
Bran
had
never
seen
before,
others
he
knew
as
well
as
his
own,
yet
they
all
seemed
equally
foreign
to
him.
He
watched
them
as
from
a
distance,
as
if
he
still
sat
in
the
window
of
his
bedchamber
looking
down
on
the
yard
below,
seeing
everything
yet
a
part
of
nothing.

Osha
moved
among
the
tables,
pouring
ale.
One
of
Leobald
TallhartвЂ™s
men
slid
a
hand
up
under
her
skirts
and
she
broke
the
flagon
over
his
head,
to
roars
of
laughter.
Yet
Mikken
had
his
hand
down
some
womanвЂ™s
bodice,
and
she
seemed
not
to
mind.
Bran
watched
Farlen
make
his
red
bitch
beg
for
bones
and
smiled
at
Old
Nan
plucking
at
the
crust
of
a
hot
pie
with
wrinkled
fingers.
On
the
dais,
Lord
Wyman
attacked
a
steaming
plate
of
lampreys
as
if
they
were
an
enemy
host.
He
was
so
fat
that
Ser
Rodrik
had
commanded
that
a
special
wide
chair
be
built
for
him
to
sit
in,
but
he
laughed
loud
and
often,
and
Bran
thought
he
liked
him.
Poor
wan
Lady
Hornwood
sat
beside
him,
her
face
a
stony
mask
as
she
picked
listlessly
at
her
food.
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
high
table,
Hothen
and
Mors
were
playing
a
drinking
game,
slamming
their
horns
together
as
hard
as
knights
meeting
in
joust.

It
is
too
hot
here,
and
too
noisy,
and
they
are
all
getting
drunk.
Bran
itched
under
his
grey
and
white
woolens,
and
suddenly
he
wished
he
were
anywhere
but
here.
It
is
cool
in
the
godswood
now.
Steam
is
rising
off
the
hot
pools,
and
the
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
are
rustling.
The
smells
are
richer
than
here,
and
before
long
the
moon
will
rise
and
my
brother
will
sing
to
it.

вЂњBran?вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said.
вЂњYou
do
not
eat.вЂќ

The
waking
dream
had
been
so
vivid,
for
a
moment
Bran
had
not
known
where
he
was.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
more
later,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњMy
bellyвЂ™s
full
to
bursting.вЂќ

The
old
knightвЂ™s
white
mustache
was
pink
with
wine.
вЂњYou
have
done
well,
Bran.
Here,
and
at
the
audiences.
You
will
be
an
especial
fine
lord
one
day,
I
think.вЂќ

I
want
to
be
a
knight.
Bran
took
another
sip
of
the
spiced
honey
wine
from
his
fatherвЂ™s
goblet,
grateful
for
something
to
clutch.
The
lifelike
head
of
a
snarling
direwolf
was
raised
on
the
side
of
the
cup.
He
felt
the
silver
muzzle
pressing
against
his
palm,
and
remembered
the
last
time
he
had
seen
his
lord
father
drink
from
this
goblet.

It
had
been
the
night
of
the
welcoming
feast,
when
King
Robert
had
brought
his
court
to
Winterfell.
Summer
still
reigned
then.
His
parents
had
shared
the
dais
with
Robert
and
his
queen,
with
her
brothers
beside
her.
Uncle
Benjen
had
been
there
too,
all
in
black.
Bran
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
sat
with
the
kingвЂ™s
children,
Joffrey
and
Tommen
and
Princess
Myrcella,
whoвЂ™d
spent
the
whole
meal
gazing
at
Robb
with
adoring
eyes.
Arya
made
faces
across
the
table
when
no
one
was
looking;
Sansa
listened
raptly
while
the
kingвЂ™s
high
harper
sang
songs
of
chivalry,
and
Rickon
kept
asking
why
Jon
wasnвЂ™t
with
them.
вЂњBecause
heвЂ™s
a
bastard,вЂќ
Bran
finally
had
to
whisper
to
him.

And
now
they
are
all
gone.
It
was
as
if
some
cruel
god
had
reached
down
with
a
great
hand
and
swept
them
all
away,
the
girls
to
captivity,
Jon
to
the
Wall,
Robb
and
Mother
to
war,
King
Robert
and
Father
to
their
graves,
and
perhaps
Uncle
Benjen
as
wellвЂ¦

Even
down
on
the
benches,
there
were
new
men
at
the
tables.
Jory
was
dead,
and
Fat
Tom,
and
Porther,
Alyn,
Desmond,
Hullen
who
had
been
master
of
horse,
Harwin
his
sonвЂ¦
all
those
who
had
gone
south
with
his
father,
even
Septa
Mordane
and
Vayon
Poole.
The
rest
had
ridden
to
war
with
Robb,
and
might
soon
be
dead
as
well
for
all
Bran
knew.
He
liked
Hayhead
and
Poxy
Tym
and
Skittrick
and
the
other
new
men
well
enough,
but
he
missed
his
old
friends.

He
looked
up
and
down
the
benches
at
all
the
faces
happy
and
sad,
and
wondered
who
would
be
missing
next
year
and
the
year
after.
He
might
have
cried
then,
but
he
couldnвЂ™t.
He
was
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,
his
fatherвЂ™s
son
and
his
brotherвЂ™s
heir,
and
almost
a
man
grown.

At
the
foot
of
the
hall,
the
doors
opened
and
a
gust
of
cold
air
made
the
torches
flame
brighter
for
an
instant.
Alebelly
led
two
new
guests
into
the
feast.
вЂњThe
Lady
Meera
of
House
Reed,вЂќ
the
rotund
guardsman
bellowed
over
the
clamor.
вЂњWith
her
brother,
Jojen,
of
Greywater
Watch.вЂќ

Men
looked
up
from
their
cups
and
trenchers
to
eye
the
newcomers.
Bran
heard
Little
Walder
mutter,
вЂњFrogeaters,вЂќ
to
Big
Walder
beside
him.
Ser
Rodrik
climbed
to
his
feet.
вЂњBe
welcome,
friends,
and
share
this
harvest
with
us.вЂќ
Serving
men
hurried
to
lengthen
the
table
on
the
dais,
fetching
trestles
and
chairs.

вЂњWho
are
they?вЂќ
Rickon
asked.

вЂњMudmen,вЂќ
answered
Little
Walder
disdainfully.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
thieves
and
cravens,
and
they
have
green
teeth
from
eating
frogs.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
crouched
beside
BranвЂ™s
seat
to
whisper
counsel
in
his
ear.
вЂњYou
must
greet
these
ones
warmly.
I
had
not
thought
to
see
them
here,
butвЂ¦
you
know
who
they
are?вЂќ

Bran
nodded.
вЂњCrannogmen.
From
the
Neck.вЂќ

вЂњHowland
Reed
was
a
great
friend
to
your
father,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
told
him.
вЂњThese
two
are
his,
it
would
seem.вЂќ

As
the
newcomers
walked
the
length
of
the
hall,
Bran
saw
that
one
was
indeed
a
girl,
though
he
would
never
have
known
it
by
her
dress.
She
wore
lambskin
breeches
soft
with
long
use,
and
a
sleeveless
jerkin
armored
in
bronze
scales.
Though
near
RobbвЂ™s
age,
she
was
slim
as
a
boy,
with
long
brown
hair
knotted
behind
her
head
and
only
the
barest
suggestion
of
breasts.
A
woven
net
hung
from
one
slim
hip,
a
long
bronze
knife
from
the
other;
under
her
arm
she
carried
an
old
iron
greathelm
spotted
with
rust;
a
frog
spear
and
round
leathern
shield
were
strapped
to
her
back.

Her
brother
was
several
years
younger
and
bore
no
weapons.
All
his
garb
was
green,
even
to
the
leather
of
his
boots,
and
when
he
came
closer
Bran
saw
that
his
eyes
were
the
color
of
moss,
though
his
teeth
looked
as
white
as
anyone
elseвЂ™s.
Both
Reeds
were
slight
of
build,
slender
as
swords
and
scarcely
taller
than
Bran
himself.
They
went
to
one
knee
before
the
dais.

вЂњMy
lords
of
Stark,вЂќ
the
girl
said.
вЂњThe
years
have
passed
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands
since
my
folk
first
swore
their
fealty
to
the
King
in
the
North.
My
lord
father
has
sent
us
here
to
say
the
words
again,
for
all
our
people.вЂќ

She
is
looking
at
me,
Bran
realized.
He
had
to
make
some
answer.
вЂњMy
brother
Robb
is
fighting
in
the
south,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbut
you
can
say
your
words
to
me,
if
you
like.вЂќ

вЂњTo
Winterfell
we
pledge
the
faith
of
Greywater,вЂќ
they
said
together.
вЂњHearth
and
heart
and
harvest
we
yield
up
to
you,
my
lord.
Our
swords
and
spears
and
arrows
are
yours
to
command.
Grant
mercy
to
our
weak,
help
to
our
helpless,
and
justice
to
all,
and
we
shall
never
fail
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
swear
it
by
earth
and
water,вЂќ
said
the
boy
in
green.

вЂњI
swear
it
by
bronze
and
iron,вЂќ
his
sister
said.

вЂњWe
swear
it
by
ice
and
fire,вЂќ
they
finished
together.

Bran
groped
for
words.
Was
he
supposed
to
swear
something
back
to
them?
Their
oath
was
not
one
he
had
been
taught.
вЂњMay
your
winters
be
short
and
your
summers
bountiful,вЂќ
he
said.
That
was
usually
a
good
thing
to
say.
вЂњRise.
IвЂ™m
Brandon
Stark.вЂќ

The
girl,
Meera,
got
to
her
feet
and
helped
her
brother
up.
The
boy
stared
at
Bran
all
the
while.
вЂњWe
bring
you
gifts
of
fish
and
frog
and
fowl,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњI
thank
you.вЂќ
Bran
wondered
if
he
would
have
to
eat
a
frog
to
be
polite.
вЂњI
offer
you
the
meat
and
mead
of
Winterfell.вЂќ
He
tried
to
recall
all
he
had
been
taught
of
the
crannogmen,
who
dwelt
amongst
the
bogs
of
the
Neck
and
seldom
left
their
wetlands.
They
were
a
poor
folk,
fishers
and
frog-hunters
who
lived
in
houses
of
thatch
and
woven
reeds
on
floating
islands
hidden
in
the
deeps
of
the
swamp.
It
was
said
that
they
were
a
cowardly
people
who
fought
with
poisoned
weapons
and
preferred
to
hide
from
foes
rather
than
face
them
in
open
battle.
And
yet
Howland
Reed
had
been
one
of
FatherвЂ™s
staunchest
companions
during
the
war
for
King
RobertвЂ™s
crown,
before
Bran
was
born.

The
boy,
Jojen,
looked
about
the
hall
curiously
as
he
took
his
seat.
вЂњWhere
are
the
direwolves?вЂќ

вЂњIn
the
godswood,вЂќ
Rickon
answered.
вЂњShaggy
was
bad.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brother
would
like
to
see
them,вЂќ
the
girl
said.

Little
Walder
spoke
up
loudly.
вЂњHeвЂ™d
best
watch
they
donвЂ™t
see
him,
or
theyвЂ™ll
take
a
bite
out
of
him.вЂќ

вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t
bite
if
IвЂ™m
there.вЂќ
Bran
was
pleased
that
they
wanted
to
see
the
wolves.
вЂњSummer
wonвЂ™t
anyway,
and
heвЂ™ll
keep
Shaggydog
away.вЂќ
He
was
curious
about
these
mudmen.
He
could
not
recall
ever
seeing
one
before.
His
father
had
sent
letters
to
the
Lord
of
Greywater
over
the
years,
but
none
of
the
crannogmen
had
ever
called
at
Winterfell.
He
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
them
more,
but
the
Great
Hall
was
so
noisy
that
it
was
hard
to
hear
anyone
who
wasnвЂ™t
right
beside
you.

Ser
Rodrik
was
right
beside
Bran.
вЂњDo
they
truly
eat
frogs?вЂќ
he
asked
the
old
knight.

вЂњAye,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said.
вЂњFrogs
and
fish
and
lizard-lions,
and
all
manner
of
birds.вЂќ

Maybe
they
donвЂ™t
have
sheep
and
cattle,
Bran
thought.
He
commanded
the
serving
men
to
bring
them
mutton
chops
and
a
slice
off
the
aurochs
and
fill
their
trenchers
with
beef-and-barley
stew.
They
seemed
to
like
that
well
enough.
The
girl
caught
him
staring
at
her
and
smiled.
Bran
blushed
and
looked
away.

Much
later,
after
all
the
sweets
had
been
served
and
washed
down
with
gallons
of
surnmerwine,
the
food
was
cleared
and
the
tables
shoved
back
against
the
walls
to
make
room
for
the
dancing.
The
music
grew
wilder,
the
drummers
joined
in,
and
Hother
Umber
brought
forth
a
huge
curved
warhorn
banded
in
silver.
When
the
singer
reached
the
part
in
вЂњThe
Night
That
EndedвЂќ
where
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
rode
forth
to
meet
the
Others
in
the
Battle
for
the
Dawn,
he
blew
a
blast
that
set
all
the
dogs
to
barking.

Two
Glover
men
began
a
spinning
skirl
on
bladder
and
woodharp.
Mors
Umber
was
the
first
on
his
feet.
He
seized
a
passing
serving
girl
by
the
arm,
knocking
the
flagon
of
wine
out
of
her
hands
to
shatter
on
the
floor.
Amidst
the
rushes
and
bones
and
bits
of
bread
that
littered
the
stone,
he
whirled
her
and
spun
her
and
tossed
her
in
the
air.
The
girl
squealed
with
laughter
and
turned
red
as
her
skirts
swirled
and
lifted.

Others
soon
joined
in.
Hodor
began
to
dance
all
by
himself,
while
Lord
Wyman
asked
little
Beth
Cassel
to
partner
him.
For
all
his
size,
he
moved
gracefully.
When
he
tired,
Cley
Cerwyn
danced
with
the
child
in
his
stead.
Ser
Rodrik
approached
Lady
Hornwood,
but
she
made
her
excuses
and
took
her
leave.
Bran
watched
long
enough
to
be
polite,
and
then
had
Hodor
summoned.
He
was
hot
and
tired,
flushed
from
the
wine,
and
the
dancing
made
him
sad.
it
was
something
else
he
could
never
do.
вЂњI
want
to
go.вЂќ

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
Hodor
shouted
back,
kneeling.
Maester
Luwin
and
Hayhead
lifted
him
into
his
basket.
The
folk
of
Winterfell
had
seen
this
sight
half
a
hundred
times,
but
doubtless
it
looked
queer
to
the
guests,
some
of
whom
were
more
curious
than
polite.
Bran
felt
the
stares.

They
went
out
the
rear
rather
than
walk
the
length
of
the
hall,
Bran
ducking
his
head
as
they
passed
through
the
lordвЂ™s
door.
In
the
dim-lit
gallery
outside
the
Great
Hall,
they
came
upon
Joseth
the
master
of
horse
engaged
in
a
different
sort
of
riding.
He
had
some
woman
Bran
did
not
know
shoved
up
against
the
wall,
her
skirts
around
her
waist.
She
was
giggling
until
Hodor
stopped
to
watch.
Then
she
screamed.
вЂњLeave
them
be,
Hodor,вЂќ
Bran
had
to
tell
him.
вЂњTake
me
to
my
bedchamber.вЂќ

Hodor
carried
him
up
the
winding
steps
to
his
tower
and
knelt
beside
one
of
the
iron
bars
that
Mikken
had
driven
into
the
wall.
Bran
used
the
bars
to
move
himself
to
the
bed,
and
Hodor
pulled
off
his
boots
and
breeches.
вЂњYou
can
go
back
to
the
feast
now,
but
donвЂ™t
go
bothering
Joseth
and
that
woman,вЂќ
Bran
said.

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
Hodor
replied,
bobbing
his
head.

When
he
blew
out
his
bedside
candle,
darkness
covered
him
like
a
soft,
familiar
blanket.
The
faint
sound
of
music
drifted
through
his
shuttered
window.

Something
his
father
had
told
him
once
when
he
was
little
came
back
to
him
suddenly.
He
had
asked
Lord
Eddard
if
the
Kingsguard
were
truly
the
finest
knights
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
вЂњNo
longer,вЂќ
he
answered,
вЂњbut
once
they
were
a
marvel,
a
shining
lesson
to
the
world.вЂќ

вЂњWas
there
one
who
was
best
of
all?вЂќ

вЂњThe
finest
knight
I
ever
saw
was
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
who
fought
with
a
blade
called
Dawn,
forged
from
the
heart
of
a
fallen
star.
They
called
him
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
and
he
would
have
killed
me
but
for
Howland
Reed.вЂќ
Father
had
gotten
sad
then,
and
he
would
say
no
more.
Bran
wished
he
had
asked
him
what
he
meant.

He
went
to
sleep
with
his
head
full
of
knights
in
gleaming
armor,
fighting
with
swords
that
shone
like
starfire,
but
when
the
dream
came
he
was
in
the
godswood
again.
The
smells
from
the
kitchen
and
the
Great
Hall
were
so
strong
that
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
never
left
the
feast.
He
prowled
beneath
the
trees,
his
brother
close
behind
him.
This
night
was
wildly
alive,
full
of
the
howling
of
the
man-pack
at
their
play.
The
sounds
made
him
restless.
He
wanted
to
run,
to
hunt,
he
wanted
toвЂ”

The
rattle
of
iron
made
his
ears
prick
up.
His
brother
heard
it
too.
They
raced
through
the
undergrowth
toward
the
sound.
Bounding
across
the
still
water
at
the
foot
of
the
old
white
one,
he
caught
the
scent
of
a
stranger,
the
man-smell
well
mixed
with
leather
and
earth
and
iron.

The
intruders
had
pushed
a
few
yards
into
the
wood
when
he
came
upon
them;
a
female
and
a
young
male,
with
no
taint
of
fear
to
them,
even
when
he
showed
them
the
white
of
his
teeth.
His
brother
growled
low
in
his
throat,
yet
still
they
did
not
run.

вЂњHere
they
come,вЂќ
the
female
said.
Meera,
some
part
of
him
whispered,
some
wisp
of
the
sleeping
boy
lost
in
the
wolf
dream.
вЂњDid
you
know
they
would
be
so
big?вЂќ

вЂњThey
will
be
bigger
still
before
they
are
grown,вЂќ
the
young
male
said,
watching
them
with
eyes
large,
green,
and
unafraid.
вЂњThe
black
one
is
full
of
fear
and
rage,
but
the
grey
is
strongвЂ¦
stronger
than
he
knowsвЂ¦
can
you
feel
him,
sister?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
she
said,
moving
a
hand
to
the
hilt
of
the
long
brown
knife
she
wore.
вЂњGo
careful,
Joien.вЂќ

вЂњHe
wonвЂ™t
hurt
me.
This
is
not
the
day
I
die.вЂќ
The
male
walked
toward
them,
unafraid,
and
reached
out
for
his
muzzle,
a
touch
as
light
as
a
summer
breeze.
Yet
at
the
brush
of
those
fingers
the
wood
dissolved
and
the
very
ground
turned
to
smoke
beneath
his
feet
and
swirled
away
laughing,
and
then
he
was
spinning
and
falling,
falling,
fallingвЂ¦





CATELYN

As
she
slept
amidst
the
rolling
grasslands,
Catelyn
dreamt
that
Bran
was
whole
again,
that
Arya
and
Sansa
held
hands,
that
Rickon
was
still
a
babe
at
her
breast.
Robb,
crownless,
played
with
a
wooden
sword,
and
when
all
were
safe
asleep,
she
found
Ned
in
her
bed,
smiling.

Sweet
it
was,
sweet
and
gone
too
soon.
Dawn
came
cruel,
a
dagger
of
light.
She
woke
aching
and
alone
and
weary;
weary
of
riding,
weary
of
hurting,
weary
of
duty.
I
want
to
weep,
she
thought.
I
want
to
be
comforted.
IвЂ™m
so
tired
of
being
strong.
I
want
to
be
foolish
and
frightened
for
once.
Just
for
a
small
while,
thatвЂ™s
allвЂ¦
a
dayвЂ¦
an
hourвЂ¦

Outside
her
tent,
men
were
stirring.
She
heard
the
whicker
of
horses,
Shadd
complaining
of
stiffness
in
his
back,
Ser
Wendel
calling
for
his
bow.
Catelyn
wished
they
would
all
go
away.
They
were
good
men,
loyal,
yet
she
was
tired
of
them
all.
It
was
her
children
she
yearned
after.
One
day,
she
promised
herself
as
she
lay
abed,
one
day
she
would
allow
herself
to
be
less
than
strong.

But
not
today.
It
could
not
be
today.

Her
fingers
seemed
more
clumsy
than
usual
as
she
fumbled
on
her
clothes.
She
supposed
she
ought
to
be
grateful
that
she
had
any
use
of
her
hands
at
all.
The
dagger
had
been
Valyrian
steel,
and
Valyrian
steel
bites
deep
and
sharp.
She
had
only
to
look
at
the
scars
to
remember.

Outside,
Shadd
was
stirring
oats
into
a
kettle,
while
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
sat
stringing
his
bow.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
he
said
when
Catelyn
emerged.
вЂњThere
are
birds
in
this
grass.
Would
you
fancy
a
roast
quail
to
break
your
fast
this
morning?вЂќ

вЂњOats
and
bread
are
sufficientвЂ¦
for
all
of
us,
I
think.
We
have
many
leagues
yet
to
ride,
Ser
Wendel.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will,
my
lady.вЂќ
The
knightвЂ™s
moon
face
looked
crestfallen,
the
tips
of
his
great
walrus
mustache
twitching
with
disappointment.
вЂњOats
and
bread,
and
what
could
be
better?вЂќ
He
was
one
of
the
fattest
men
Catelyn
had
ever
known,
but
howevermuch
he
loved
his
food,
he
loved
his
honor
more.

вЂњFound
some
nettles
and
brewed
a
tea,вЂќ
Shadd
announced.
вЂњWill
mвЂ™lady
take
a
cup?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
with
thanks.вЂќ

She
cradled
the
tea
in
her
scarred
hands
and
blew
on
it
to
cool
it.
Shadd
was
one
of
the
Winterfell
men.
Robb
had
sent
twenty
of
his
best
to
see
her
safely
to
Renly.
He
had
sent
five
lordlings
as
well,
whose
names
and
high
birth
would
add
weight
and
honor
to
her
mission.
As
they
made
their
way
south,
staying
well
clear
of
towns
and
holdfasts,
they
had
seen
bands
of
mailed
men
more
than
once,
and
glimpsed
smoke
on
the
eastern
horizon,
but
none
had
dared
molest
them.
They
were
too
weak
to
be
a
threat,
too
many
to
be
easy
prey.
Once
across
the
Blackwater,
the
worst
was
behind.
For
the
past
four
days,
they
had
seen
no
signs
of
war.

Catelyn
had
never
wanted
this.
She
had
told
Robb
as
much,
back
in
Riverrun.
вЂњWhen
last
I
saw
Renly,
he
was
a
boy
no
older
than
Bran.
I
do
not
know
him.
Send
someone
else.
My
place
is
here
with
my
father,
for
whatever
time
he
has
left.вЂќ

Her
son
had
looked
at
her
unhappily.
вЂњThere
is
no
one
else.
I
cannot
go
myself.
Your
fatherвЂ™s
too
ill.
The
Blackfish
is
my
eyes
and
ears,
I
dare
not
lose
him.
Your
brother
I
need
to
hold
Riverrun
when
we
marchвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњMarch?вЂќ
No
one
had
said
a
word
to
her
of
marching.

вЂњI
cannot
sit
at
Riverrun
waiting
for
peace.
It
makes
me
look
as
if
I
were
afraid
to
take
the
field
again.
When
there
are
no
battles
to
fight,
men
start
to
think
of
hearth
and
harvest,
Father
told
me
that.
Even
my
northmen
grow
restless.вЂќ

My
northmen,
she
thought.
He
is
even
starting
to
talk
like
a
king.
вЂњNo
one
has
ever
died
of
restlessness,
but
rashness
is
another
matter.
WeвЂ™ve
planted
seeds,
let
them
grow.вЂќ

Robb
shook
his
head
stubbornly.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
tossed
some
seeds
in
the
wind,
thatвЂ™s
all.
if
your
sister
Lysa
was
coming
to
aid
us,
we
would
have
heard
by
now.
How
many
birds
have
we
sent
to
the
Eyrie,
four?
I
want
peace
too,
but
why
should
the
Lannisters
give
me
anything
if
all
I
do
is
sit
here
while
my
army
melts
away
around
me
swift
as
summer
snow?вЂќ

вЂњSo
rather
than
look
craven,
you
will
dance
to
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
pipes?вЂќ
she
threw
back.
вЂњHe
wants
you
to
march
on
Harrenhal,
ask
your
uncle
Brynden
ifвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
said
nothing
of
Harrenhal,вЂќ
Robb
said.
вЂњNow,
will
you
go
to
Renly
for
me,
or
must
I
send
the
Greatjon?вЂќ

The
memory
brought
a
wan
smile
to
her
face.
Such
an
obvious
ploy,
that,
yet
deft
for
a
boy
of
fifteen.
Robb
knew
how
ill-suited
a
man
like
Greatjon
Umber
would
be
to
treat
with
a
man
like
Renly
Baratheon,
and
he
knew
that
she
knew
it
as
well.
What
could
she
do
but
accede,
praying
that
her
father
would
live
until
her
return?
Had
Lord
Hoster
been
well,
he
would
have
gone
himself,
she
knew.
Still,
that
leavetaking
was
hard,
hard.
He
did
not
even
know
her
when
she
came
to
say
farewell.
вЂњMinisa,вЂќ
he
called
her,
вЂњwhere
are
the
children?
My
little
Cat,
my
sweet
LysaвЂ¦вЂќ
Catelyn
had
kissed
him
on
the
brow
and
told
him
his
babes
were
well.
вЂњWait
for
me,
my
lord,вЂќ
she
said
as
his
eyes
closed.
вЂњI
waited
for
you,
oh,
so
many
times.
Now
you
must
wait
for
me.вЂќ

Fate
drives
me
south
and
south
again,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
sipped
the
astringent
tea,
when
it
is
north
I
should
be
going,
north
to
home.
She
had
written
to
Bran
and
Rickon,
that
last
night
at
Riverrun.
I
do
not
forget
you,
my
sweet
ones,
you
must
believe
that.
It
is
only
that
your
brother
needs
me
more.

вЂњWe
ought
to
reach
the
upper
Mander
today,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Wendel
announced
while
Shadd
spooned
out
the
porridge.
вЂњLord
Renly
will
not
be
far,
if
the
talk
be
true.вЂќ

And
what
do
I
tell
him
when
I
find
him?
That
my
son
holds
him
no
true
king?
She
did
not
relish
this
meeting.
They
needed
friends,
not
more
enemies,
yet
Robb
would
never
bend
the
knee
in
homage
to
a
man
he
felt
had
no
claim
to
the
throne.

Her
bowl
was
empty,
though
she
could
scarce
remember
tasting
the
porridge.
She
laid
it
aside.
вЂњIt
is
time
we
were
away.вЂќ
The
sooner
she
spoke
to
Renly,
the
sooner
she
could
turn
for
home.
She
was
the
first
one
mounted,
and
she
set
the
pace
for
the
column.
Hal
Mollen
rode
beside
her,
bearing
the
banner
of
House
Stark,
the
grey
direwolf
on
an
ice-white
field.

They
were
still
a
half
dayвЂ™s
ride
from
RenlyвЂ™s
camp
when
they
were
taken.
Robin
Flint
had
ranged
ahead
to
scout,
and
he
came
galloping
back
with
word
of
a
far-eyes
watching
from
the
roof
of
a
distant
windmill.
By
the
time
CatelynвЂ™s
party
reached
the
mill,
the
man
was
long
gone.
They
pressed
on,
covering
not
quite
a
mile
before
RenlyвЂ™s
outriders
came
swooping
down
on
them,
twenty
men
mailed
and
mounted,
led
by
a
grizzled
greybeard
of
a
knight
with
bluejays
on
his
surcoat.

When
he
saw
her
banners,
he
trotted
up
to
her
alone.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
he
called,
вЂњI
am
Ser
Colen
of
Greenpools,
as
it
please
you.
These
are
dangerous
lands
you
cross.вЂќ

вЂњOur
business
is
urgent,вЂќ
she
answered
him.
вЂњI
come
as
envoy
from
my
son,
Robb
Stark,
the
King
in
the
North,
to
treat
with
Renly
Baratheon,
the
King
in
the
South.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Renly
is
the
crowned
and
anointed
lord
of
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Colen
answered,
though
courteously
enough.
вЂњHis
Grace
is
encamped
with
his
host
near
Bitterbridge,
where
the
roseroad
crosses
the
Mander.
It
shall
be
my
great
honor
to
escort
you
to
him.вЂќ
The
knight
raised
a
mailed
hand,
and
his
men
formed
a
double
column
flanking
Catelyn
and
her
guard.
Escort
or
captor?
she
wondered.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
trust
in
Ser
ColenвЂ™s
honor,
and
Lord
RenlyвЂ™s.

They
saw
the
smoke
of
the
campвЂ™s
fires
when
they
were
still
an
hour
from
the
river.
Then
the
sound
came
drifting
across
farm
and
field
and
rolling
plain,
indistinct
as
the
murmur
of
some
distant
sea,
but
swelling
as
they
rode
closer.
By
the
time
they
caught
sight
of
the
ManderвЂ™s
muddy
waters
glinting
in
the
sun,
they
could
make
out
the
voices
of
men,
the
clatter
of
steel,
the
whinny
of
horses.
Yet
neither
sound
nor
smoke
prepared
them
for
the
host
itself.

Thousands
of
cookfires
filled
the
air
with
a
pale
smoky
haze.
The
horse
lines
alone
stretched
out
over
leagues.
A
forest
had
surely
been
felled
to
make
the
tall
staffs
that
held
the
banners.
Great
siege
engines
lined
the
grassy
verge
of
the
roseroad,
mangonels
and
trebuchets
and
rolling
rams
mounted
on
wheels
taller
than
a
man
on
horseback.
The
steel
points
of
pikes
flamed
red
with
sunlight,
as
if
already
blooded,
while
the
pavilions
of
the
knights
and
high
lords
sprouted
from
the
grass
like
silken
mushrooms.
She
saw
men
with
spears
and
men
with
swords,
men
in
steel
caps
and
mail
shirts,
camp
followers
strutting
their
charms,
archers
fletching
arrows,
teamsters
driving
wagons,
swineherds
driving
pigs,
pages
running
messages,
squires
honing
swords,
knights
riding
palfreys,
grooms
leading
ill-tempered
destriers.
вЂњThis
is
a
fearsome
lot
of
men,вЂќ
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
observed
as
they
crossed
the
ancient
stone
span
from
which
Bitterbridge
took
its
name.

вЂњThat
it
is,вЂќ
Catelyn
agreed.

Near
all
the
chivalry
of
the
south
had
come
to
RenlyвЂ™s
call,
it
seemed.
The
golden
rose
of
Highgarden
was
seen
everywhere:
sewn
on
the
right
breast
of
armsmen
and
servants,
flapping
and
fluttering
from
the
green
silk
banners
that
adorned
lance
and
pike,
painted
upon
the
shields
hung
outside
the
pavilions
of
the
sons
and
brothers
and
cousins
and
uncles
of
House
Tyrell.
As
well
Catelyn
spied
the
fox-and-flowers
of
House
Florent,
Fossoway
apples
red
and
green,
Lord
TarlyвЂ™s
striding
huntsman,
oak
leaves
for
Oakheart,
cranes
for
Crane,
a
cloud
of
black-and-orange
butterflies
for
the
Mullendores.

Across
the
Mander,
the
storm
lords
had
raised
their
standardsвЂ”RenlyвЂ™s
own
bannermen,
sworn
to
House
Baratheon
and
StormвЂ™s
End.
Catelyn
recognized
Bryce
CaronвЂ™s
nightingales,
the
Penrose
quills,
and
Lord
EstermontвЂ™s
sea
turtle,
green
on
green.
Yet
for
every
shield
she
knew,
there
were
a
dozen
strange
to
her,
borne
by
the
small
lords
sworn
to
the
bannermen,
and
by
hedge
knights
and
freeriders,
who
had
come
swarming
to
make
Renly
Baratheon
a
king
in
fact
as
well
as
name.

RenlyвЂ™s
own
standard
flew
high
over
all.
From
the
top
of
his
tallest
siege
tower,
a
wheeled
oaken
immensity
covered
with
rawhides,
streamed
the
largest
war
banner
that
Catelyn
had
ever
seenвЂ”a
cloth
big
enough
to
carpet
many
a
hall,
shimmering
gold,
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
black
upon
it,
prancing
proud
and
tall.

вЂњMy
lady,
do
you
hear
that
noise?вЂќ
asked
Hallis
Mollen,
trotting
close.
вЂњWhat
is
that?вЂќ

She
listened.
Shouts,
and
horses
screaming,
and
the
clash
of
steel,
andвЂ¦вЂњCheering,вЂќ
she
said.
They
had
been
riding
up
a
gentle
slope
toward
a
line
of
brightly
colored
pavilions
on
the
height.
As
they
passed
between
them,
the
press
of
men
grew
thicker,
the
sounds
louder.
And
then
she
saw.

Below,
beneath
the
stone-and-timber
battlements
of
a
small
castle,
a
melee
was
in
progress.

A
field
had
been
cleared
off,
fences
and
galleries
and
tilting
barriers
thrown
up.
Hundreds
were
gathered
to
watch,
perhaps
thousands.
From
the
looks
of
the
grounds,
torn
and
muddy
and
littered
with
bits
of
dinted
armor
and
broken
lances,
they
had
been
at
it
for
a
day
or
more,
but
now
the
end
was
near.
Fewer
than
a
score
of
knights
remained
ahorse,
charging
and
slashing
at
each
other
as
watchers
and
fallen
combatants
cheered
them
on.
She
saw
two
destriers
collide
in
full
armor,
going
down
in
a
tangle
of
steel
and
horseflesh.
вЂњA
tourney,вЂќ
Hal
Mollen
declared.
He
had
a
penchant
for
loudly
announcing
the
obvious.

вЂњOh,
splendid,вЂќ
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
said
as
a
knight
in
a
rainbow-striped
cloak
wheeled
to
deliver
a
backhand
blow
with
a
long-handled
axe
that
shattered
the
shield
of
the
man
pursuing
him
and
sent
him
reeling
in
his
stirrups.

The
press
in
front
of
them
made
further
progress
difficult.
вЂњLady
Stark,вЂќ
Ser
Colen
said,
вЂњif
your
men
would
be
so
good
as
to
wait
here,
IвЂ™ll
present
you
to
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.вЂќ
She
gave
the
command,
though
she
had
to
raise
her
voice
to
be
heard
above
the
tourney
din.
Ser
Colen
walked
his
horse
slowly
through
the
throngs,
with
Catelyn
riding
in
his
wake.
A
roar
went
up
from
the
crowd
as
a
helmetless
red-bearded
man
with
a
griffin
on
his
shield
went
down
before
a
big
knight
in
blue
armor.
His
steel
was
a
deep
cobalt,
even
the
blunt
morningstar
he
wielded
with
such
deadly
effect,
his
mount
barded
in
the
quartered
sun-and-moon
heraldry
of
House
Tarth.

вЂњRed
RonnetвЂ™s
down,
gods
be
damned,вЂќ
a
man
cursed.

вЂњLorasвЂ™ll
do
for
that
blueвЂ”вЂќ
a
companion
answered
before
a
roar
drowned
out
the
rest
of
his
words.

Another
man
was
fallen,
trapped
beneath
his
injured
horse,
both
of
them
screaming
in
pain.
Squires
rushed
out
to
aid
them.

This
is
madness,
Catelyn
thought.
Real
enemies
on
every
side
and
half
the
realm
in
flames,
and
Renly
sits
here
playing
at
war
like
a
boy
with
his
first
wooden
sword.

The
lords
and
ladies
in
the
gallery
were
as
engrossed
in
the
melee
as
the
men
on
the
ground.
Catelyn
marked
them
well.
Her
father
had
oft
treated
with
the
southron
lords,
and
not
a
few
had
been
guests
at
Riverrun.
She
recognized
Lord
Mathis
Rowan,
stouter
and
more
florid
than
ever,
the
golden
tree
of
his
House
spread
across
his
white
doublet.
Below
him
sat
Lady
Oakheart,
tiny
and
delicate,
and
to
her
left
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
of
Horn
Hill,
his
greatsword
Heartsbane
propped
up
against
the
back
of
his
seat.
Others
she
knew
only
by
their
sigils,
and
some
not
at
all.

In
their
midst,
watching
and
laughing
with
his
young
queen
by
his
side,
sat
a
ghost
in
a
golden
crown.

Small
wonder
the
lords
gather
around
him
with
such
fervor,
she
thought,
he
is
Robert
come
again.
Renly
was
handsome
as
Robert
had
been
handsome;
long
of
limb
and
broad
of
shoulder,
with
the
same
coal-black
hair,
fine
and
straight,
the
same
deep
blue
eyes,
the
same
easy
smile.
The
slender
circlet
around
his
brows
seemed
to
suit
him
well.
It
was
soft
gold,
a
ring
of
roses
exquisitely
wrought;
at
the
front
lifted
a
stagвЂ™s
head
of
dark
green
jade,
adorned
with
golden
eyes
and
golden
antlers.

The
crowned
stag
decorated
the
kingвЂ™s
green
velvet
tunic
as
well,
worked
in
gold
thread
upon
his
chest;
the
Baratheon
sigil
in
the
colors
of
Highgarden.
The
girl
who
shared
the
high
seat
with
him
was
also
of
Highgarden:
his
young
queen,
Margaery,
daughter
to
Lord
Mace
Tyrell.
Their
marriage
was
the
mortar
that
held
the
great
southron
alliance
together,
Catelyn
knew.
Renly
was
one-and-twenty,
the
girl
no
older
than
Robb,
very
pretty,
with
a
doeвЂ™s
soft
eyes
and
a
mane
of
curling
brown
hair
that
fell
about
her
shoulders
in
lazy
ringlets.
Her
smile
was
shy
and
sweet.

Out
in
the
field,
another
man
lost
his
seat
to
the
knight
in
the
rainbow-striped
cloak,
and
the
king
shouted
approval
with
the
rest.
вЂњLoras!вЂќ
she
heard
him
call.
вЂњLoras!
Highgarden!вЂќ
The
queen
clapped
her
hands
together
in
excitement.

Catelyn
turned
to
see
the
end
of
it.
Only
four
men
were
left
in
the
fight
now,
and
there
was
small
doubt
whom
king
and
commons
favored.
She
had
never
met
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
but
even
in
the
distant
north
one
heard
tales
of
the
prowess
of
the
young
Knight
of
Flowers.
Ser
Loras
rode
a
tall
white
stallion
in
silver
mail,
and
fought
with
a
long-handled
axe.
A
crest
of
golden
roses
ran
down
the
center
of
his
helm.

Two
of
the
other
survivors
had
made
common
cause.
They
spurred
their
mounts
toward
the
knight
in
the
cobalt
armor.
As
they
closed
to
either
side,
the
blue
knight
reined
hard,
smashing
one
man
full
in
the
face
with
his
splintered
shield
while
his
black
destrier
lashed
out
with
a
steel-shod
hoof
at
the
other.
In
a
blink,
one
combatant
was
unhorsed,
the
other
reeling.
The
blue
knight
let
his
broken
shield
drop
to
the
ground
to
free
his
left
arm,
and
then
the
Knight
of
Flowers
was
on
him.
The
weight
of
his
steel
seemed
to
hardly
diminish
the
grace
and
quickness
with
which
Ser
Loras
moved,
his
rainbow
cloak
swirling
about
him.

The
white
horse
and
the
black
one
wheeled
like
lovers
at
a
harvest
dance,
the
riders
throwing
steel
in
place
of
kisses.
Longaxe
flashed
and
morningstar
whirled.
Both
weapons
were
blunted,
yet
still
they
raised
an
awful
clangor.
Shieldless,
the
blue
knight
was
getting
much
the
worse
of
it.
Ser
Loras
rained
down
blows
on
his
head
and
shoulders,
to
shouts
of
вЂњHighgarden!вЂќ
from
the
throng.
The
other
gave
answer
with
his
morningstar,
but
whenever
the
ball
came
crashing
in,
Ser
Loras
interposed
his
battered
green
shield,
emblazoned
with
three
golden
roses.
When
the
longaxe
caught
the
blue
knightвЂ™s
hand
on
the
backswing
and
sent
the
morningstar
flying
from
his
grasp,
the
crowd
screamed
like
a
rutting
beast.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
raised
his
axe
for
the
final
blow.

The
blue
knight
charged
into
it.
The
stallions
slammed
together,
the
blunted
axehead
smashed
against
the
scarred
blue
breastplateвЂ¦
but
somehow
the
blue
knight
had
the
haft
locked
between
steel-gauntleted
fingers.
He
wrenched
it
from
Ser
LorasвЂ™s
hand,
and
suddenly
the
two
were
grappling
mount-to-mount,
and
an
instant
later
they
were
falling.
As
their
horses
pulled
apart,
they
crashed
to
the
ground
with
bone-jarring
force.
Loras
Tyrell,
on
the
bottom,
took
the
brunt
of
the
impact.
The
blue
knight
pulled
a
long
dirk
free
and
flicked
open
TyrellвЂ™s
visor.
The
roar
of
the
crowd
was
too
loud
for
Catelyn
to
hear
what
Ser
Loras
said,
but
she
saw
the
word
form
on
his
split,
bloody
lips.
Yield.

The
blue
knight
climbed
unsteady
to
his
feet,
and
raised
his
dirk
in
the
direction
of
Renly
Baratheon,
the
salute
of
a
champion
to
his
king.
Squires
dashed
onto
the
field
to
help
the
vanquished
knight
to
his
feet.
When
they
got
his
helm
off,
Catelyn
was
startled
to
see
how
young
he
was.
He
could
not
have
had
more
than
two
years
on
Robb.
The
boy
might
have
been
as
comely
as
his
sister,
but
the
broken
lip,
unfocused
eyes,
and
blood
trickling
through
his
matted
hair
made
it
hard
to
be
certain.

вЂњApproach,вЂќ
King
Renly
called
to
the
champion.

He
limped
toward
the
gallery.
At
close
hand,
the
brilliant
blue
armor
looked
rather
less
splendid;
everywhere
it
showed
scars,
the
dents
of
mace
and
warhammer,
the
long
gouges
left
by
swords,
chips
in
the
enameled
breastplate
and
helm.
His
cloak
hung
in
rags.
From
the
way
he
moved,
the
man
within
was
no
less
battered.
A
few
voices
hailed
him
with
cries
of
вЂњTarth!вЂќ
and,
oddly,
вЂњA
Beauty!
A
Beauty!вЂќ
but
most
were
silent.
The
blue
knight
knelt
before
the
king.
вЂњGrace,вЂќ
he
said,
his
voice
muffled
by
his
dented
greathelm.

вЂњYou
are
all
your
lord
father
claimed
you
were.вЂќ
RenlyвЂ™s
voice
carried
over
the
field.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
seen
Ser
Loras
unhorsed
once
or
twiceвЂ¦
but
never
quite
in
that
fashion.вЂќ

вЂњThat
were
no
proper
unhorsing,вЂќ
complained
a
drunken
archer
nearby,
a
Tyrell
rose
sewn
on
his
jerkin.
вЂњA
vile
trick,
pulling
the
lad
down.вЂќ

The
press
had
begun
to
open
up.
вЂњSer
Colen,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
to
her
escort,
вЂњwho
is
this
man,
and
why
do
they
mislike
him
so?вЂќ

Ser
Colen
frowned.
вЂњBecause
he
is
no
man,
my
lady.
ThatвЂ™s
Brienne
of
Tarth,
daughter
to
Lord
Selwyn
the
Evenstar.вЂќ

вЂњDaughter?вЂќ
Catelyn
was
horrified.

вЂњBrienne
the
Beauty,
they
name
herвЂ¦
though
not
to
her
face,
lest
they
be
called
upon
to
defend
those
words
with
their
bodies.вЂќ

She
heard
King
Renly
declare
the
Lady
Brienne
of
Tarth
the
victor
of
the
great
melee
at
Bitterbridge,
last
mounted
of
one
hundred
sixteen
knights.
вЂњAs
champion,
you
may
ask
of
me
any
boon
that
you
desire.
If
it
lies
in
my
power,
it
is
yours.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Brienne
answered,
вЂњI
ask
the
honor
of
a
place
among
your
Rainbow
Guard.
I
would
be
one
of
your
seven,
and
pledge
my
life
to
yours,
to
go
where
you
go,
ride
at
your
side,
and
keep
you
safe
from
all
hurt
and
harm.вЂќ

вЂњDone,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњRise,
and
remove
your
helm.вЂќ

She
did
as
he
bid
her.
And
when
the
greathelm
was
lifted,
Catelyn
understood
Ser
ColenвЂ™s
words.

Beauty,
they
called
herвЂ¦
mocking.
The
hair
beneath
the
visor
was
a
squirrelвЂ™s
nest
of
dirty
straw,
and
her
faceвЂ¦
BrienneвЂ™s
eyes
were
large
and
very
blue,
a
young
girlвЂ™s
eyes,
trusting
and
guileless,
but
the
restвЂ¦
her
features
were
broad
and
coarse,
her
teeth
prominent
and
crooked,
her
mouth
too
wide,
her
lips
so
plump
they
seemed
swollen.
A
thousand
freckles
speckled
her
cheeks
and
brow,
and
her
nose
had
been
broken
more
than
once.
Pity
filled
CatelynвЂ™s
heart.
Is
there
any
creature
on
earth
as
unfortunate
as
an
ugly
woman?

And
yet,
when
Renly
cut
away
her
torn
cloak
and
fastened
a
rainbow
in
its
place,
Brienne
of
Tarth
did
not
look
unfortunate.
Her
smile
lit
up
her
face,
and
her
voice
was
strong
and
proud
as
she
said,
вЂњMy
life
for
yours,
Your
Grace.
From
this
day
on,
I
am
your
shield,
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.вЂќ
The
way
she
looked
at
the
kingвЂ”looked
down
at
him,
she
was
a
good
hand
higher,
though
Renly
was
near
as
tall
as
his
brother
had
beenвЂ”was
painful
to
see.

вЂњYour
Grace!вЂќ
Ser
Colen
of
Greenpools
swung
down
off
his
horse
to
approach
the
gallery.
вЂњI
beg
your
leave.вЂќ
He
went
to
one
knee.
вЂњI
have
the
honor
to
bring
you
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark,
sent
as
envoy
by
her
son
Robb,
Lord
of
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњLord
of
Winterfell
and
King
in
the
North,
ser,вЂќ
Catelyn
corrected
him.
She
dismounted
and
moved
to
Ser
ColenвЂ™s
side.

King
Renly
looked
surprised.
вЂњLady
Catelyn?
We
are
most
pleased.вЂќ
He
turned
to
his
young
queen.
вЂњMargaery
my
sweet,
this
is
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
of
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
most
welcome
here,
Lady
Stark,вЂќ
the
girl
said,
all
soft
courtesy.
вЂњI
am
sorry
for
your
loss.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
kind,вЂќ
said
Catelyn.

вЂњMy
lady,
I
swear
to
you,
I
will
see
that
the
Lannisters
answer
for
your
husbandвЂ™s
murder,вЂќ
the
king
declared.
вЂњWhen
I
take
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
IвЂ™ll
send
you
CerseiвЂ™s
head.вЂќ

And
will
that
bring
my
Ned
back
to
me?
she
thought.
вЂњIt
will
be
enough
to
know
that
justice
has
been
done,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Brienne
the
Blue
corrected
sharply.
вЂњAnd
you
should
kneel
when
you
approach
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњThe
distance
between
a
lord
and
a
grace
is
a
small
one,
my
lady,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњLord
Renly
wears
a
crown,
as
does
my
son.
If
you
wish,
we
may
stand
here
in
the
mud
and
debate
what
honors
and
titles
are
rightly
due
to
each,
but
it
strikes
me
that
we
have
more
pressing
matters
to
consider.вЂќ

Some
of
RenlyвЂ™s
lords
bristled
at
that,
but
the
king
only
laughed.
вЂњWell
said,
my
lady.
There
will
be
time
enough
for
graces
when
these
wars
are
done.
Tell
me,
when
does
your
son
mean
to
march
against
Harrenhal?вЂќ

Until
she
knew
whether
this
king
was
friend
or
foe,
Catelyn
was
not
about
to
reveal
the
least
part
of
RobbвЂ™s
dispositions.
вЂњI
do
not
sit
on
my
sonвЂ™s
war
councils,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњSo
long
as
he
leaves
a
few
Lannisters
for
me,
IвЂ™ll
not
complain.
What
has
he
done
with
the
Kingslayer?вЂќ

вЂњJaime
Lannister
is
held
prisoner
at
Riverrun.вЂќ

вЂњStill
alive?вЂќ
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
seemed
dismayed.

Bemused,
Renly
said,
вЂњIt
would
seem
the
direwolf
is
gentler
than
the
lion.вЂќ

вЂњGentler
than
the
Lannisters,вЂќ
murmured
Lady
Oakheart
with
a
bitter
smile,
вЂњis
drier
than
the
sea.вЂќ

вЂњI
call
it
weak.вЂќ
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
had
a
short,
bristly
grey
beard
and
a
reputation
for
blunt
speech.
вЂњNo
disrespect
to
you,
Lady
Stark,
but
it
would
have
been
more
seemly
had
Lord
Robb
come
to
pay
homage
to
the
king
himself,
rather
than
hiding
behind
his
motherвЂ™s
skirts.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Robb
is
warring,
my
lord,вЂќ
Catelyn
replied
with
icy
courtesy,
вЂњnot
playing
at
tourney.вЂќ

Renly
grinned.
вЂњGo
softly,
Lord
Randyll,
I
fear
youвЂ™re
overmatched.вЂќ
He
summoned
a
steward
in
the
livery
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
вЂњFind
a
place
for
the
ladyвЂ™s
companions,
and
see
that
they
have
every
comfort.
Lady
Catelyn
shall
have
my
own
pavilion.
Since
Lord
Caswell
has
been
so
kind
as
to
give
me
use
of
his
castle,
I
have
no
need
of
it.
My
lady,
when
you
are
rested,
I
would
be
honored
if
you
would
share
our
meat
and
mead
at
the
feast
Lord
Caswell
is
giving
us
tonight.
A
farewell
feast.
I
fear
his
lordship
is
eager
to
see
the
heels
of
my
hungry
horde.вЂќ

вЂњNot
true,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
protested
a
wispy
young
man
who
must
have
been
Caswell.
вЂњWhat
is
mine
is
yours.вЂќ

вЂњWhenever
someone
said
that
to
my
brother
Robert,
he
took
them
at
their
word,вЂќ
Renly
said.
вЂњDo
you
have
daughters?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
Your
Grace.
Two.вЂќ

вЂњThen
thank
the
gods
that
I
am
not
Robert.
My
sweet
queen
is
all
the
woman
I
desire.вЂќ
Renly
held
out
his
hand
to
help
Margaery
to
her
feet.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
talk
again
when
youвЂ™ve
had
a
chance
to
refresh
yourself,
Lady
Catelyn.вЂќ

Renly
led
his
bride
back
toward
the
castle
while
his
steward
conducted
Catelyn
to
the
kingвЂ™s
green
silk
pavilion.
вЂњIf
you
have
need
of
anything,
you
have
only
to
ask,
my
lady.вЂќ

Catelyn
could
scarcely
imagine
what
she
might
need
that
had
not
already
been
provided.
The
pavilion
was
larger
than
the
common
rooms
of
many
an
inn
and
furnished
with
every
comfort:
feather
mattress
and
sleeping
furs,
a
wood-and-copper
tub
large
enough
for
two,
braziers,
to
keep
off
the
nightвЂ™s
chill,
slung
leather
camp
chairs,
a
writing
table
with
quills
and
inkpot,
bowls
of
peaches,
plums,
and
pears,
a
flagon
of
wine
with
a
set
of
matched
silver
cups,
cedar
chests
packed
full
of
RenlyвЂ™s
clothing,
books,
maps,
game
boards,
a
high
harp,
a
tall
bow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows,
a
pair
of
red-tailed
hunting
hawks,
a
vertible
armory
of
fine
weapons.
He
does
not
stint
himself,
this
Renly,
she
thought
as
she
looked
about.
Small
wonder
this
host
moves
so
slowly.

Beside
the
entrance,
the
kingвЂ™s
armor
stood
sentry;
a
suit
of
forest-green
plate,
its
fittings
chased
with
gold,
the
helm
crowned
by
a
great
rack
of
golden
antlers.
The
steel
was
polished
to
such
a
high
sheen
that
she
could
see
her
reflection
in
the
breastplate,
gazing
back
at
her
as
if
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
green
pond.
The
face
of
a
drowned
woman,
Catelyn
thought.
Can
you
drown
in
grief?
She
turned
away
sharply,
angry
with
her
own
frailty.
She
had
no
time
for
the
luxury
of
self-pity.
She
must
wash
the
dust
from
her
hair
and
change
into
a
gown
more
fitting
for
a
kingвЂ™s
feast.

Ser
Wendel
Manderly,
Lucas
Blackwood,
Ser
Perwyn
Frey,
and
the
rest
of
her
highborn
companions
accompanied
her
to
the
castle.
The
great
hall
of
Lord
CaswellвЂ™s
keep
was
great
only
by
courtesy,
yet
room
was
found
on
the
crowded
benches
for
CatelynвЂ™s
men,
amidst
RenlyвЂ™s
own
knights.
Catelyn
was
assigned
a
place
on
the
dais
between
red-faced
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
and
genial
Ser
Jon
Fossoway
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways.
Ser
Jon
made
jests,
while
Lord
Mathis
inquired
politely
after
the
health
of
her
father,
brother,
and
children.

Brienne
of
Tarth
had
been
seated
at
the
far
end
of
the
high
table.
She
did
not
gown
herself
as
a
lady,
but
chose
a
knightвЂ™s
finery
instead,
a
velvet
doublet
quartered
rose-and-azure,
breeches
and
boots
and
a
fine-tooled
swordbelt,
her
new
rainbow
cloak
flowing
down
her
back.
No
garb
could
disguise
her
plainness,
though;
the
huge
freckled
hands,
the
wide
flat
face,
the
thrust
of
her
teeth.
Out
of
armor,
her
body
seemed
ungainly,
broad
of
hip
and
thick
of
limb,
with
hunched
muscular
shoulders
but
no
bosom
to
speak
of.
And
it
was
clear
from
her
every
action
that
Brienne
knew
it,
and
suffered
for
it.
She
spoke
only
in
answer,
and
seldom
lifted
her
gaze
from
her
food.

Of
food
there
was
plenty.
The
war
had
not
touched
the
fabled
bounty
of
Highgarden.
While
singers
sang
and
tumblers
tumbled,
they
began
with
pears
poached
in
wine,
and
went
on
to
tiny
savory
fish
rolled
in
salt
and
cooked
crisp,
and
capons
stuffed
with
onions
and
mushrooms.
There
were
great
loaves
of
brown
bread,
mounds
of
turnips
and
sweetcorn
and
pease,
immense
hams
and
roast
geese
and
trenchers
dripping
full
of
venison
stewed
with
beer
and
barley.
For
the
sweet,
Lord
CaswellвЂ™s
servants
brought
down
trays
of
pastries
from
his
castle
kitchens,
cream
swans
and
spun-sugar
unicorns,
lemon
cakes
in
the
shape
of
roses,
spiced
honey
biscuits
and
blackberry
tarts,
apple
crisps
and
wheels
of
buttery
cheese.

The
rich
foods
made
Catelyn
queasy,
but
it
would
never
do
to
show
frailty
when
so
much
depended
on
her
strength.
She
ate
sparingly,
while
she
watched
this
man
who
would
be
king.
Renly
sat
with
his
young
bride
on
his
left
hand
and
her
brother
on
the
right.
Apart
from
the
white
linen
bandage
around
his
brow,
Ser
Loras
seemed
none
the
worse
for
the
dayвЂ™s
misadventures.
He
was
indeed
as
comely
as
Catelyn
had
suspected
he
might
be.
When
not
glazed,
his
eyes
were
lively
and
intelligent,
his
hair
an
artless
tumble
of
brown
locks
that
many
a
maid
might
have
envied.
He
had
replaced
his
tattered
tourney
cloak
with
a
new
one;
the
same
brilliantly
striped
silk
of
RenlyвЂ™s
Rainbow
Guard,
clasped
with
the
golden
rose
of
Highgarden.

From
time
to
time,
King
Renly
would
feed
Margaery
some
choice
morsel
off
the
point
of
his
dagger,
or
lean
over
to
plant
the
lightest
of
kisses
on
her
cheek,
but
it
was
Ser
Loras
who
shared
most
of
his
jests
and
confidences.
The
king
enjoyed
his
food
and
drink,
that
was
plain
to
see,
yet
he
seemed
neither
glutton
nor
drunkard.
He
laughed
often,
and
well,
and
spoke
amiably
to
highborn
lords
and
lowly
serving
wenches
alike.

Some
of
his
guests
were
less
moderate.
They
drank
too
much
and
boasted
too
loudly,
to
her
mind.
Lord
WillumвЂ™s
sons
Josua
and
Elyas
disputed
heatedly
about
who
would
be
first
over
the
walls
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Lord
Varner
dandled
a
serving
girl
on
his
lap,
nuzzling
at
her
neck
while
one
hand
went
exploring
down
her
bodice.
Guyard
the
Green,
who
fancied
himself
a
singer,
diddled
a
harp
and
gave
them
a
verse
about
tying
lionsвЂ™
tails
in
knots,
parts
of
which
rhymed.
Ser
Mark
Mullendore
brought
a
black-and-white
monkey
and
fed
him
morsels
from
his
own
plate,
while
Ser
Tanton
of
the
red-apple
Fossoways
climbed
on
the
table
and
swore
to
slay
Sandor
Clegane
in
single
combat.
The
vow
might
have
been
taken
more
solemnly
if
Ser
Tanton
had
not
had
one
foot
in
a
gravy
boat
when
he
made
it.

The
height
of
folly
was
reached
when
a
plump
fool
came
capering
out
in
gold-painted
tin
with
a
cloth
lionвЂ™s
head,
and
chased
a
dwarf
around
the
tables,
whacking
him
over
the
head
with
a
bladder.
Finally
King
Renly
demanded
to
know
why
he
was
beating
his
brother.
вЂњWhy,
Your
Grace,
IвЂ™m
the
Kinslayer,вЂќ
the
fool
said.

вЂњItвЂ™s
Kingslayer,
fool
of
a
fool,вЂќ
Renly
said,
and
the
hall
rang
with
laughter.

Lord
Rowan
beside
her
did
not
join
the
merriment.
вЂњThey
are
all
so
young,вЂќ
he
said.

It
was
true.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
could
not
have
reached
his
second
name
day
when
Robert
slew
Prince
Rhaegar
on
the
Trident.
Few
of
the
others
were
very
much
older.
They
had
been
babes
during
the
Sack
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
and
no
more
than
boys
when
Balon
Greyjoy
raised
the
Iron
Islands
in
rebellion.
They
are
still
unblooded,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
watched
Lord
Bryce
goad
Ser
Robar
into
juggling
a
brace
of
daggers.
It
is
all
a
game
to
them
still,
a
tourney
writ
large,
and
all
they
see
is
the
chance
for
glory
and
honor
and
spoils.
They
are
boys
drunk
on
song
and
story,
and
like
all
boys,
they
think
themselves
immortal.

вЂњWar
will
make
them
old,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
вЂњas
it
did
us.вЂќ
She
had
been
a
girl
when
Robert
and
Ned
and
Jon
Arryn
raised
their
banners
against
Aerys
Targaryen,
a
woman
by
the
time
the
fighting
was
done.
вЂњI
pity
them.вЂќ

вЂњWhy?вЂќ
Lord
Rowan
asked
her.
вЂњLook
at
them.
TheyвЂ™re
young
and
strong,
full
of
life
and
laughter.
And
lust,
aye,
more
lust
than
they
know
what
to
do
with.
There
will
be
many
a
bastard
bred
this
night,
I
promise
you.
Why
pity?вЂќ

вЂњBecause
it
will
not
last,вЂќ
Catelyn
answered,
sadly.
вЂњBecause
they
are
the
knights
of
summer,
and
winter
is
coming.вЂќ

вЂњLady
Catelyn,
you
are
wrong.вЂќ
Brienne
regarded
her
with
eyes
as
blue
as
her
armor.
вЂњWinter
will
never
come
for
the
likes
of
us.
Should
we
die
in
battle,
they
will
surely
sing
of
us,
and
itвЂ™s
always
summer
in
the
songs.
In
the
songs
all
knights
are
gallant,
all
maids
are
beautiful,
and
the
sun
is
always
shining.вЂќ

Winter
comes
for
all
of
us,
Catelyn
thought.
For
me,
it
came
when
Ned
died.
It
will
come
for
you
too,
child,
and
sooner
than
you
like.
She
did
not
have
the
heart
to
say
it.

The
king
saved
her.
вЂњLady
Catelyn,вЂќ
Renly
called
down.
вЂњI
feel
the
need
of
some
air.
Will
you
walk
with
me?вЂќ

Catelyn
stood
at
once.
вЂњI
should
be
honored.вЂќ

Brienne
was
on
her
feet
as
well.
вЂњYour
Grace,
give
me
but
a
moment
to
don
my
mail.
You
should
not
be
without
protection.вЂќ

King
Renly
smiled.
вЂњIf
I
am
not
safe
in
the
heart
of
Lord
CaswellвЂ™s
castle,
with
my
own
host
around
me,
one
sword
will
make
no
matterвЂ¦
not
even
your
sword,
Brienne.
Sit
and
eat.
If
I
have
need
of
you,
IвЂ™ll
send
for
you.вЂќ

His
words
seemed
to
strike
the
girl
harder
than
any
blow
she
had
taken
that
afternoon.
вЂњAs
you
will,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
Brienne
sat,
eyes
downcast.
Renly
took
CatelynвЂ™s
arm
and
led
her
from
the
hall,
past
a
slouching
guardsman
who
straightened
so
hurriedly
that
he
near
dropped
his
spear.
Renly
clapped
the
man
on
the
shoulder
and
made
a
jest
of
it.

вЂњThis
way,
my
lady.вЂќ
The
king
took
her
through
a
low
door
into
a
stair
tower.
As
they
started
up,
he
said,
вЂњPerchance,
is
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
with
your
son
at
Riverrun?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
she
answered,
puzzled.
вЂњIs
he
no
longer
with
Joffrey?
He
was
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.вЂќ

Renly
shook
his
head.
вЂњThe
Lannisters
told
him
he
was
too
old
and
gave
his
cloak
to
the
Hound.
IвЂ™m
told
he
left
KingвЂ™s
Landing
vowing
to
take
up
service
with
the
true
king.
That
cloak
Brienne
claimed
today
was
the
one
I
was
keeping
for
Selmy,
in
hopes
that
he
might
offer
me
his
sword.
When
he
did
not
turn
up
at
Highgarden,
I
thought
perhaps
he
had
gone
to
Riverrun
instead.вЂќ

вЂњWe
have
not
seen
him.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
old,
yes,
but
a
good
man
still.
I
hope
he
has
not
come
to
harm.
The
Lannisters
are
great
fools.вЂќ
They
climbed
a
few
more
steps.
вЂњOn
the
night
of
RobertвЂ™s
death,
I
offered
your
husband
a
hundred
swords
and
urged
him
to
take
Joffrey
into
his
power.
Had
he
listened,
he
would
be
regent
today,
and
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
me
to
claim
the
throne.вЂќ

вЂњNed
refused
you.вЂќ
She
did
not
have
to
be
told.

вЂњHe
had
sworn
to
protect
RobertвЂ™s
children,вЂќ
Renly
said.
вЂњI
lacked
the
strength
to
act
alone,
so
when
Lord
Eddard
turned
me
away,
I
had
no
choice
but
to
flee.
Had
I
stayed,
I
knew
the
queen
would
see
to
it
that
I
did
not
long
outlive
my
brother.вЂќ

Had
you
stayed,
and
lent
your
support
to
Ned,
he
might
still
be
alive,
Catelyn
thought
bitterly.

вЂњI
liked
your
husband
well
enough,
my
lady.
He
was
a
loyal
friend
to
Robert,
I
knowвЂ¦
but
he
would
not
listen
and
he
would
not
bend.
Here,
I
wish
to
show
you
something.вЂќ
They
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairwell.
Renly
pushed
open
a
wooden
door,
and
they
stepped
out
onto
the
roof.

Lord
CaswellвЂ™s
keep
was
scarcely
tall
enough
to
call
a
tower,
but
the
country
was
low
and
flat
and
Catelyn
could
see
for
leagues
in
all
directions.
Wherever
she
looked,
she
saw
fires.
They
covered
the
earth
like
fallen
stars,
and
like
the
stars
there
was
no
end
to
them.
вЂњCount
them
if
you
like,
my
lady,вЂќ
Renly
said
quietly.
вЂњYou
will
still
be
counting
when
dawn
breaks
in
the
east.
How
many
fires
burn
around
Riverrun
tonight,
I
wonder?вЂќ

Catelyn
could
hear
faint
music
drifting
from
the
Great
Hall,
seeping
out
into
the
night.
She
dare
not
count
the
stars.

вЂњIвЂ™m
told
your
son
crossed
the
Neck
with
twenty
thousand
swords
at
his
back,вЂќ
Renly
went
on.
вЂњNow
that
the
lords
of
the
Trident
are
with
him,
perhaps
he
commands
forty
thousand.вЂќ

No,
she
thought,
not
near
so
many,
we
have
lost
men
in
battle,
and
others
to
the
harvest.

вЂњI
have
twice
that
number
here,вЂќ
Renly
said,
вЂњand
this
is
only
part
of
my
strength.
Mace
Tyrell
remains
at
Highgarden
with
another
ten
thousand,
I
have
a
strong
garrison
holding
StormвЂ™s
End,
and
soon
enough
the
Dornishmen
will
join
me
with
all
their
power.
And
never
forget
my
brother
Stannis,
who
holds
Dragonstone
and
commands
the
lords
of
the
narrow
sea.вЂќ

вЂњIt
would
seem
that
you
are
the
one
who
has
forgotten
Stannis,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
more
sharply
than
sheвЂ™d
intended.

вЂњHis
claim,
you
mean?вЂќ
Renly
laughed.
вЂњLet
us
be
blunt,
my
lady.
Stannis
would
make
an
appalling
king.
Nor
is
he
like
to
become
one.
Men
respect
Stannis,
even
fear
him,
but
precious
few
have
ever
loved
him.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
still
your
elder
brother.
If
either
of
you
can
be
said
to
have
a
right
to
the
Iron
Throne,
it
must
be
Lord
Stannis.вЂќ

Renly
shrugged.
вЂњTell
me,
what
right
did
my
brother
Robert
ever
have
to
the
Iron
Throne?вЂќ
He
did
not
wait
for
an
answer.
вЂњOh,
there
was
talk
of
the
blood
ties
between
Baratheon
and
Targaryen,
of
weddings
a
hundred
years
past,
of
second
sons
and
elder
daughters.
No
one
but
the
maesters
care
about
any
of
it.
Robert
won
the
throne
with
his
warhammer.вЂќ
He
swept
a
hand
across
the
campfires
that
burned
from
horizon
to
horizon.
вЂњWell,
there
is
my
claim,
as
good
as
RobertвЂ™s
ever
was.
If
your
son
supports
me
as
his
father
supported
Robert,
heвЂ™ll
not
find
me
ungenerous.
I
will
gladly
confirm
him
in
all
his
lands,
titles,
and
honors.
He
can
rule
in
Winterfell
as
he
pleases.
He
can
even
go
on
calling
himself
King
in
the
North
if
he
likes,
so
long
as
he
bends
the
knee
and
does
me
homage
as
his
overlord.
King
is
only
a
word,
but
fealty,
loyalty,
serviceвЂ¦
those
I
must
have.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
he
will
not
give
them
to
you,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњI
mean
to
be
king,
my
lady,
and
not
of
a
broken
kingdom.
I
cannot
say
it
plainer
than
that.
Three
hundred
years
ago,
a
Stark
king
knelt
to
Aegon
the
Dragon,
when
he
saw
he
could
not
hope
to
prevail.
That
was
wisdom.
Your
son
must
be
wise
as
well.
Once
he
joins
me,
this
war
is
good
as
done.
WeвЂ”вЂќ
Renly
broke
off
suddenly,
distracted.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
this
now?вЂќ

The
rattle
of
chains
heralded
the
raising
of
the
portcullis.
Down
in
the
yard
below,
a
rider
in
a
winged
helm
urged
his
well-lathered
horse
under
the
spikes.
вЂњSummon
the
king!вЂќ
he
called.

Renly
vaulted
up
into
a
crenel.
вЂњIвЂ™m
here,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
The
rider
spurred
his
mount
closer.
вЂњI
came
swift
as
I
could.
From
StormвЂ™s
End.
We
are
besieged,
Your
Grace,
Ser
Cortnay
defies
them,
butвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњButвЂ¦
thatвЂ™s
not
possible.
I
would
have
been
told
if
Lord
Tywin
left
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњThese
are
no
Lannisters,
my
liege.
ItвЂ™s
Lord
Stannis
at
your
gates.
King
Stannis,
he
calls
himself
now.вЂќ





JON

A
blowing
rain
lashed
at
JonвЂ™s
face
as
he
spurred
his
horse
across
the
swollen
stream.
Beside
him,
Lord
Commander
Mormont
gave
the
hood
of
his
cloak
a
tug,
muttering
curses
on
the
weather.
His
raven
sat
on
his
shoulder,
feathers
ruffled,
as
soaked
and
grumpy
as
the
Old
Bear
himself.
A
gust
of
wind
sent
wet
leaves
flapping
round
them
like
a
flock
of
dead
birds.
The
haunted
forest,
Jon
thought
ruefully.
The
drowned
forest,
more
like
it.

He
hoped
Sam
was
holding
up,
back
down
the
column.
He
was
not
a
good
rider
even
in
fair
weather,
and
six
days
of
rain
had
made
the
ground
treacherous,
all
soft
mud
and
hidden
rocks.
When
the
wind
blew,
it
drove
the
water
right
into
their
eyes.
The
Wall
would
be
flowing
off
to
the
south,
the
melting
ice
mingling
with
warm
rain
to
wash
down
in
sheets
and
rivers.
Pyp
and
Toad
would
be
sitting
near
the
fire
in
the
common
room,
drinking
cups
of
mulled
wine
before
their
supper.
Jon
envied
them.
His
wet
wool
clung
to
him
sodden
and
itching,
his
neck
and
shoulders
ached
fiercely
from
the
weight
of
mail
and
sword,
and
he
was
sick
of
salt
cod,
salt
beef,
and
hard
cheese.

Up
ahead
a
hunting
horn
sounded
a
quavering
note,
half
drowned
beneath
the
constant
patter
of
the
rain.
вЂњBuckwellвЂ™s
horn,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
announced.
вЂњThe
gods
are
good;
CrasterвЂ™s
still
there.вЂќ
His
raven
gave
a
single
flap
of
his
big
wings,
croaked
вЂњCorn,вЂќ
and
ruffled
his
feathers
up
again.

Jon
had
often
heard
the
black
brothers
tell
tales
of
Craster
and
his
keep.
Now
he
would
see
it
with
his
own
eyes.
After
seven
empty
villages,
they
had
all
come
to
dread
finding
CrasterвЂ™s
as
dead
and
desolate
as
the
rest,
but
it
seemed
they
would
be
spared
that.
Perhaps
the
Old
Bear
will
finally
get
some
answers,
he
thought.
Anyway,
weвЂ™ll
be
out
of
the
rain.

Thoren
Smallwood
swore
that
Craster
was
a
friend
to
the
Watch,
despite
his
unsavory
reputation.
вЂњThe
manвЂ™s
half-mad,
I
wonвЂ™t
deny
it,вЂќ
heвЂ™d
told
the
Old
Bear,
вЂњbut
youвЂ™d
be
the
same
if
youвЂ™d
spent
your
life
in
this
cursed
wood.
Even
so,
heвЂ™s
never
turned
a
ranger
away
from
his
fire,
nor
does
he
love
Mance
Rayder.
HeвЂ™ll
give
us
good
counsel.вЂќ

So
long
as
he
gives
us
a
hot
meal
and
a
chance
to
dry
our
clothes,
IвЂ™ll
be
happy.
Dywen
said
Craster
was
a
kinslayer,
liar,
raper,
and
craven,
and
hinted
that
he
trafficked
with
slavers
and
demons.
вЂњAnd
worse,вЂќ
the
old
forester
would
add,
clacking
his
wooden
teeth.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
cold
smell
to
that
one,
there
is.вЂќ

вЂњJon,вЂќ
Lord
Mormont
commanded,
вЂњride
back
along
the
column
and
spread
the
word.
And
remind
the
officers
that
I
want
no
trouble
about
CrasterвЂ™s
wives.
The
men
are
to
mind
their
hands
and
speak
to
these
women
as
little
as
need
be.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
my
lord.вЂќ
Jon
turned
his
horse
back
the
way
theyвЂ™d
come.
It
was
pleasant
to
have
the
rain
out
of
his
face,
if
only
for
a
little
while.
Everyone
he
passed
seemed
to
be
weeping.
The
march
was
strung
out
through
half
a
mile
of
woods.

In
the
midst
of
the
baggage
train,
Jon
passed
Samwell
Tarly,
slumped
in
his
saddle
under
a
wide
floppy
hat.
He
was
riding
one
dray
horse
and
leading
the
others.
The
drumming
of
the
rain
against
the
hoods
of
their
cages
had
the
ravens
squawking
and
fluttering.
вЂњYou
put
a
fox
in
with
them?вЂќ
Jon
called
out.

Water
ran
off
the
brim
of
SamвЂ™s
hat
as
he
lifted
his
head.
вЂњOh,
hullo,
Jon.
No,
they
just
hate
the
rain,
the
same
as
us.вЂќ

вЂњHow
are
you
faring,
Sam?вЂќ

вЂњWetly.вЂќ
The
fat
boy
managed
a
smile.
вЂњNothing
has
killed
me
yet,
though.вЂќ

вЂњGood.
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep
is
just
ahead.
If
the
gods
are
good,
heвЂ™ll
let
us
sleep
by
his
fire.вЂќ

Sam
looked
dubious.
вЂњDolorous
Edd
says
CrasterвЂ™s
a
terrible
savage.
He
marries
his
daughters
and
obeys
no
laws
but
those
he
makes
himself.
And
Dywen
told
Grenn
heвЂ™s
got
black
blood
in
his
veins.
His
mother
was
a
wildling
woman
who
lay
with
a
ranger,
so
heвЂ™s
a
basвЂ¦вЂќ
Suddenly
he
realized
what
he
was
about
to
say.

вЂњA
bastard,вЂќ
Jon
said
with
a
laugh.
вЂњYou
can
say
it,
Sam.
IвЂ™ve
heard
the
word
before.вЂќ
He
put
the
spurs
to
his
surefooted
little
garron.
вЂњI
need
to
hunt
down
Ser
Ottyn.
Be
careful
around
CrasterвЂ™s
women.вЂќ
As
if
Samwell
Tarly
needed
warning
on
that
score.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
talk
later,
after
weвЂ™ve
made
camp.вЂќ

Jon
carried
the
word
back
to
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers,
plodding
along
with
the
rear
guard.
A
small
prune-faced
man
of
an
age
with
Mormont,
Ser
Ottyn
always
looked
tired,
even
at
Castle
Black,
and
the
rain
had
beaten
him
down
unmercifully.
вЂњWelcome
tidings,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњThis
wet
has
soaked
my
bones,
and
even
my
saddle
sores
complain
of
saddle
sores.вЂќ

On
his
way
back,
Jon
swung
wide
of
the
columnвЂ™s
line
of
march
and
took
a
shorter
path
through
the
thick
of
the
wood.
The
sounds
of
man
and
horse
diminished,
swallowed
up
by
the
wet
green
wild,
and
soon
enough
he
could
hear
only
the
steady
wash
of
rain
against
leaf
and
tree
and
rock.
It
was
midafternoon,
yet
the
forest
seemed
as
dark
as
dusk.
Jon
wove
a
path
between
rocks
and
puddles,
past
great
oaks,
grey-green
sentinels,
and
black-barked
ironwoods.
In
places
the
branches
wove
a
canopy
overhead
and
he
was
given
a
momentвЂ™s
respite
from
the
drumming
of
the
rain
against
his
head.
As
he
rode
past
a
lightning-blasted
chestnut
tree
overgrown
with
wild
white
roses,
he
heard
something
rustling
in
the
underbrush.
вЂњGhost,вЂќ
he
called
out.
вЂњGhost,
to
me.вЂќ

But
it
was
Dywen
who
emerged
from
the
greenery,
forking
a
shaggy
grey
garron
with
Grenn
ahorse
beside
him.
The
Old
Bear
had
deployed
outriders
to
either
side
of
the
main
column,
to
screen
their
march
and
warn
of
the
approach
of
any
enemies,
and
even
there
he
took
no
chances,
sending
the
men
out
in
pairs.

вЂњAh,
itвЂ™s
you,
Lord
Snow.вЂќ
Dywen
smiled
an
oaken
smile;
his
teeth
were
carved
of
wood,
and
fit
badly.
вЂњThought
me
and
the
boy
had
us
one
oвЂ™
them
Others
to
deal
with.
Lose
your
wolf?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
off
hunting.вЂќ
Ghost
did
not
like
to
travel
with
the
column,
but
he
would
not
be
far.
When
they
made
camp
for
the
night,
heвЂ™d
find
his
way
to
Jon
at
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
tent.

вЂњFishing,
IвЂ™d
call
it,
in
this
wet,вЂќ
Dywen
said.

вЂњMy
mother
always
said
rain
was
good
for
growing
crops,вЂќ
Grenn
put
in
hopefully.

вЂњAye,
a
good
crop
of
mildew,вЂќ
Dywen
said.
вЂњThe
best
thing
about
a
rain
like
this,
it
saves
a
man
from
taking
baths.вЂќ
He
made
a
clacking
sound
on
his
wooden
teeth.

вЂњBuckwellвЂ™s
found
Craster,вЂќ
Jon
told
them.

вЂњHad
he
lost
him?вЂќ
Dywen
chuckled.
вЂњSee
that
you
young
bucks
donвЂ™t
go
nosing
about
CrasterвЂ™s
wives,
you
hear?вЂќ

Jon
smiled.
вЂњWant
them
all
for
yourself,
Dywen?вЂќ

Dywen
clacked
his
teeth
some
more.
вЂњMight
be
I
do.
CrasterвЂ™s
got
ten
fingers
and
one
cock,
so
he
donвЂ™t
count
but
to
eleven.
HeвЂ™d
never
miss
a
couple.вЂќ

вЂњHow
many
wives
does
he
have,
truly?вЂќ
Grenn
asked.

вЂњMoreвЂ™n
you
ever
will,
brother.
Well,
itвЂ™s
not
so
hard
when
you
breed
your
own.
ThereвЂ™s
your
beast,
Snow.вЂќ

Ghost
was
trotting
along
beside
JonвЂ™s
horse
with
tail
held
high,
his
white
fur
ruffed
up
thick
against
the
rain.
He
moved
so
silently
Jon
could
not
have
said
just
when
he
appeared.
GrennвЂ™s
mount
shied
at
the
scent
of
him;
even
now,
after
more
than
a
year,
the
horses
were
uneasy
in
the
presence
of
the
direwolf.
вЂњWith
me,
Ghost.вЂќ
Jon
spurred
off
to
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep.

He
had
never
thought
to
find
a
stone
castle
on
the
far
side
of
the
Wall,
but
he
had
pictured
some
sort
of
motte-and-bailey
with
a
wooden
palisade
and
a
timber
tower
keep.
What
they
found
instead
was
a
midden
heap,
a
pigsty,
an
empty
sheepfold,
and
a
windowless
daub-and-wattle
hall
scarce
worthy
of
the
name.
It
was
long
and
low,
chinked
together
from
logs
and
roofed
with
sod.
The
compound
stood
atop
a
rise
too
modest
to
name
a
hill,
surrounded
by
an
earthen
dike.
Brown
rivulets
flowed
down
the
slope
where
the
rain
had
eaten
gaping
holes
in
the
defenses,
to
join
a
rushing
brook
that
curved
around
to
the
north,
its
thick
waters
turned
into
a
murky
torrent
by
the
rains.

On
the
southwest,
he
found
an
open
gate
flanked
by
a
pair
of
animal
skulls
on
high
poles:
a
bear
to
one
side,
a
ram
to
the
other.
Bits
of
flesh
still
clung
to
the
bear
skull,
Jon
noted
as
he
joined
the
line
riding
past.
Within,
Jarmen
BuckwellвЂ™s
scouts
and
men
from
Thoren
SmallwoodвЂ™s
van
were
setting
up
horse
lines
and
struggling
to
raise
tents.
A
host
of
piglets
rooted
about
three
huge
sows
in
the
sty.
Nearby,
a
small
girl
pulled
carrots
from
a
garden,
naked
in
the
rain,
while
two
women
tied
a
pig
for
slaughter.
The
animalвЂ™s
squeals
were
high
and
horrible,
almost
human
in
their
distress.
ChettвЂ™s
hounds
barked
wildly
in
answer,
snarling
and
snapping
despite
his
curses,
with
a
pair
of
CrasterвЂ™s
dogs
barking
back.
When
they
saw
Ghost,
some
of
the
dogs
broke
off
and
ran,
while
others
began
to
bay
and
growl.
The
direwolf
ignored
them,
as
did
Jon.

Well,
thirty
of
us
will
be
warm
and
dry,
Jon
thought
once
heвЂ™d
gotten
a
good
look
at
the
hall.
Perhaps
as
many
as
fifty.
The
place
was
much
too
small
to
sleep
two
hundred
men,
so
most
would
need
to
remain
outside.
And
where
to
put
them?
The
rain
had
turned
half
the
compound
yard
to
ankle-deep
puddles
and
the
rest
to
sucking
mud.
Another
dismal
night
was
in
prospect.

The
Lord
Commander
had
entrusted
his
mount
to
Dolorous
Edd.
He
was
cleaning
mud
out
of
the
horseвЂ™s
hooves
as
Jon
dismounted.
вЂњLord
MormontвЂ™s
in
the
hall,вЂќ
he
announced.
вЂњHe
said
for
you
to
join
him.
Best
leave
the
wolf
outside,
he
looks
hungry
enough
to
eat
one
of
CrasterвЂ™s
children.
Well,
truth
be
told,
IвЂ™m
hungry
enough
to
eat
one
of
CrasterвЂ™s
children,
so
long
as
he
was
served
hot.
Go
on,
IвЂ™ll
see
to
your
horse.
If
itвЂ™s
warm
and
dry
inside,
donвЂ™t
tell
me,
I
wasnвЂ™t
asked
in.вЂќ
He
flicked
a
glob
of
wet
mud
out
from
under
a
horseshoe.
вЂњDoes
this
mud
look
like
shit
to
you?
Could
it
be
that
this
whole
hill
is
made
of
CrasterвЂ™s
shit?вЂќ

Jon
smiled.
вЂњWell,
I
hear
heвЂ™s
been
here
a
long
time.вЂќ

вЂњYou
cheer
me
not.
Go
see
the
Old
Bear.вЂќ

вЂњGhost,
stay,вЂќ
he
commanded.
The
door
to
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep
was
made
of
two
flaps
of
deerhide.
Jon
shoved
between
them,
stooping
to
pass
under
the
low
lintel.
Two
dozen
of
the
chief
rangers
had
preceded
him,
and
were
standing
around
the
firepit
in
the
center
of
the
dirt
floor
while
puddles
collected
about
their
boots.
The
hall
stank
of
soot,
dung,
and
wet
dog.
The
air
was
heavy
with
smoke,
yet
somehow
still
damp.
Rain
leaked
through
the
smoke
hole
in
the
roof.
It
was
all
a
single
room,
with
a
sleeping
loft
above
reached
by
a
pair
of
splintery
ladders.

Jon
remembered
how
heвЂ™d
felt
the
day
they
had
left
the
Wall:
nervous
as
a
maiden,
but
eager
to
glimpse
the
mysteries
and
wonders
beyond
each
new
horizon.
Well,
hereвЂ™s
one
of
the
wonders,
he
told
himself,
gazing
about
the
squalid,
foul-smelling
hall.
The
acrid
smoke
was
making
his
eyes
water.
A
pity
that
Pyp
and
Toad
canвЂ™t
see
all
theyвЂ™re
missing.

Craster
sat
above
the
fire,
the
only
man
to
enjoy
his
own
chair.
Even
Lord
Commander
Mormont
must
seat
himself
on
the
common
bench,
with
his
raven
muttering
on
his
shoulder.
Jarman
Buckwell
stood
behind,
dripping
from
patched
mail
and
shiny
wet
leather,
beside
Thoren
Smallwood
in
the
late
Ser
JaremyвЂ™s
heavy
breastplate
and
sable-trimmed
cloak.

CrasterвЂ™s
sheepskin
jerkin
and
cloak
of
sewn
skins
made
a
shabby
contrast,
but
around
one
thick
wrist
was
a
heavy
ring
that
had
the
glint
of
gold.
He
looked
to
be
a
powerful
man,
though
well
into
the
winter
of
his
days
now,
his
mane
of
hair
grey
going
to
white.
A
flat
nose
and
a
drooping
mouth
gave
him
a
cruel
look,
and
one
of
his
ears
was
missing.
So
this
is
a
wildling.
Jon
remembered
Old
NanвЂ™s
tales
of
the
savage
folk
who
drank
blood
from
human
skulls.
Craster
seemed
to
be
drinking
a
thin
yellow
beer
from
a
chipped
stone
cup.
Perhaps
he
had
not
heard
the
stories.

вЂњIвЂ™ve
not
seen
Benjen
Stark
for
three
years,вЂќ
he
was
telling
Mormont.
вЂњAnd
if
truth
be
told,
I
never
once
missed
him.вЂќ
A
half-dozen
black
puppies
and
the
odd
pig
or
two
skulked
among
the
benches,
while
women
in
ragged
deerskins
passed
horns
of
beer,
stirred
the
fire,
and
chopped
carrots
and
onions
into
a
kettle.

вЂњHe
ought
to
have
passed
here
last
year,вЂќ
said
Thoren
Smallwood.
A
dog
came
sniffing
round
his
leg.
He
kicked
it
and
sent
it
off
yipping.

Lord
Mormont
said,
вЂњBen
was
searching
for
Ser
Waymar
Royce,
whoвЂ™d
vanished
with
Gared
and
young
Will.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
those
three
I
recall.
The
lordling
no
older
than
one
of
these
pups.
Too
proud
to
sleep
under
my
roof,
him
in
his
sable
cloak
and
black
steel.
My
wives
give
him
big
cow
eyes
all
the
same.вЂќ
He
turned
his
squint
on
the
nearest
of
the
women.
вЂњGared
says
they
were
chasing
raiders.
I
told
him,
with
a
commander
that
green,
best
not
catch
вЂ™em.
Gared
wasnвЂ™t
half-bad,
for
a
crow.
Had
less
ears
than
me,
that
one.
The
вЂ™bite
took
вЂ™em,
same
as
mine.вЂќ
Craster
laughed.
вЂњNow
I
hear
he
got
no
head
neither.
The
вЂ™bite
do
that
too?вЂќ

Jon
remembered
a
spray
of
red
blood
on
white
snow,
and
the
way
Theon
Greyjoy
had
kicked
the
dead
manвЂ™s
head.
The
man
was
a
deserter.
On
the
way
back
to
Winterfell,
Jon
and
Robb
had
raced,
and
found
six
direwolf
pups
in
the
snow.
A
thousand
years
ago.

вЂњWhen
Ser
Waymar
left
you,
where
was
he
bound?вЂќ

Craster
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњHappens
I
have
better
things
to
do
than
tend
to
the
comings
and
goings
of
crows.вЂќ
He
drank
a
pull
of
beer
and
set
the
cup
aside.
вЂњHad
no
good
southron
wine
up
here
for
a
bearвЂ™s
night.
I
could
use
me
some
wine,
and
a
new
axe.
MineвЂ™s
lost
its
bite,
canвЂ™t
have
that,
I
got
me
women
to
protect.вЂќ
He
gazed
around
at
his
scurrying
wives.

вЂњYou
are
few
here,
and
isolated,вЂќ
Mormont
said.
вЂњIf
you
like,
IвЂ™ll
detail
some
men
to
escort
you
south
to
the
Wall.вЂќ

The
raven
seemed
to
like
the
notion.
вЂњWall,вЂќ
it
screamed,
spreading
black
wings
like
a
high
collar
behind
MormontвЂ™s
head.

Their
host
gave
a
nasty
smile,
showing
a
mouthful
of
broken
brown
teeth.
вЂњAnd
what
would
we
do
there,
serve
you
at
supper?
WeвЂ™re
free
folk
here.
Craster
serves
no
man.вЂќ

вЂњThese
are
bad
times
to
dwell
alone
in
the
wild.
The
cold
winds
are
rising.вЂќ

вЂњLet
them
rise.
My
roots
are
sunk
deep.вЂќ
Craster
grabbed
a
passing
woman
by
the
wrist.
вЂњTell
him,
wife.
Tell
the
Lord
Crow
how
well
content
we
are.вЂќ

The
woman
licked
at
thin
lips.
вЂњThis
is
our
place.
Craster
keeps
us
safe.
Better
to
die
free
than
live
a
slave.вЂќ

вЂњSlave,вЂќ
muttered
the
raven.

Mormont
leaned
forward.
вЂњEvery
village
we
have
passed
has
been
abandoned.
Yours
are
the
first
living
faces
weвЂ™ve
seen
since
we
left
the
Wall.
The
people
are
goneвЂ¦
whether
dead,
fled,
or
taken,
I
could
not
say.
The
animals
as
well.
Nothing
is
left.
And
earlier,
we
found
the
bodies
of
two
of
Ben
StarkвЂ™s
rangers
only
a
few
leagues
from
the
Wall.
They
were
pale
and
cold,
with
black
hands
and
black
feet
and
wounds
that
did
not
bleed.
Yet
when
we
took
them
back
to
Castle
Black
they
rose
in
the
night
and
killed.
One
slew
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
and
the
other
came
for
me,
which
tells
me
that
they
remember
some
of
what
they
knew
when
they
lived,
but
there
was
no
human
mercy
left
in
them.вЂќ

The
womanвЂ™s
mouth
hung
open,
a
wet
pink
cave,
but
Craster
only
gave
a
snort.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
had
no
such
troubles
hereвЂ¦
and
IвЂ™ll
thank
you
not
to
tell
such
evil
tales
under
my
roof.
IвЂ™m
a
godly
man,
and
the
gods
keep
me
safe.
If
wights
come
walking,
IвЂ™ll
know
how
to
send
them
back
to
their
graves.
Though
I
could
use
me
a
sharp
new
axe.вЂќ
He
sent
his
wife
scurrying
with
a
slap
on
her
leg
and
a
shout
of
вЂњMore
beer,
and
be
quick
about
it.вЂќ

вЂњNo
trouble
from
the
dead,вЂќ
Jarmen
Buckwell
said,
вЂњbut
what
of
the
living,
my
lord?
What
of
your
king?вЂќ

вЂњKing!вЂќ
cried
MormontвЂ™s
raven.
вЂњKing,
king,
king.вЂќ

вЂњThat
Mance
Rayder?вЂќ
Craster
spit
into
the
fire.
вЂњKing-beyond-the-Wall.
What
do
free
folk
want
with
kings?вЂќ
He
turned
his
squint
on
Mormont.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
much
I
could
tell
you
oвЂ™
Rayder
and
his
doings,
if
I
had
a
mind.
This
oвЂ™
the
empty
villages,
thatвЂ™s
his
work.
You
would
have
found
this
hall
abandoned
as
well,
if
I
were
a
man
to
scrape
to
such.
He
sends
a
rider,
tells
me
I
must
leave
my
own
keep
to
come
grovel
at
his
feet.
I
sent
the
man
back,
but
kept
his
tongue.
ItвЂ™s
nailed
to
that
wall
there.вЂќ
He
pointed.
вЂњMight
be
that
I
could
tell
you
where
to
seek
Mance
Rayder.
If
I
had
a
mind.вЂќ
The
brown
smile
again.
вЂњBut
weвЂ™ll
have
time
enough
for
that.
YouвЂ™ll
be
wanting
to
sleep
beneath
my
roof,
belike,
and
eat
me
out
of
pigs.вЂќ

вЂњA
roof
would
be
most
welcome,
my
lord,вЂќ
Mormont
said.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
had
hard
riding,
and
too
much
wet.вЂќ

вЂњThen
youвЂ™ll
guest
here
for
a
night.
No
longer,
IвЂ™m
not
that
fond
oвЂ™
crows.
The
loftвЂ™s
for
me
and
mine,
but
youвЂ™ll
have
all
the
floor
you
like.
IвЂ™ve
meat
and
beer
for
twenty,
no
more.
The
rest
oвЂ™
your
black
crows
can
peck
after
their
own
corn.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ve
packed
in
our
own
supplies,
my
lord,вЂќ
said
the
Old
Bear.
вЂњWe
should
be
pleased
to
share
our
food
and
wine.вЂќ

Craster
wiped
his
drooping
mouth
with
the
back
of
a
hairy
hand.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
taste
your
wine,
Lord
Crow,
that
I
will.
One
more
thing.
Any
man
lays
a
hand
on
my
wives,
he
loses
the
hand.вЂќ

вЂњYour
roof,
your
rule,вЂќ
said
Thoren
Smallwood,
and
Lord
Mormont
nodded
stiffly,
though
he
looked
none
too
pleased.

вЂњThatвЂ™s
settled,
then.вЂќ
Craster
grudged
them
a
grunt.
вЂњDвЂ™ya
have
a
man
can
draw
a
map?вЂќ

вЂњSam
Tarly
can.вЂќ
Jon
pushed
forward.
вЂњSam
loves
maps.вЂќ

Mormont
beckoned
him
closer.
вЂњSend
him
here
after
heвЂ™s
eaten.
Have
him
bring
quill
and
parchment.
And
find
Tollett
as
well.
Tell
him
to
bring
my
axe.
A
guest
gift
for
our
host.вЂќ

вЂњWhoвЂ™s
this
one
now?вЂќ
Craster
said
before
Jon
could
go.
вЂњHe
has
the
look
of
a
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњMy
steward
and
squire,
Jon
Snow.вЂќ

вЂњA
bastard,
is
it?вЂќ
Craster
looked
Jon
up
and
down.
вЂњMan
wants
to
bed
a
woman,
seems
like
he
ought
to
take
her
to
wife.
ThatвЂ™s
what
I
do.вЂќ
He
shooed
Jon
off
with
a
wave.
вЂњWell,
run
and
do
your
service,
bastard,
and
see
that
axe
is
good
and
sharp
now,
IвЂ™ve
no
use
for
dull
steel.вЂќ

Jon
Snow
bowed
stiffly
and
took
his
leave.
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
was
coming
in
as
he
was
leaving,
and
they
almost
collided
at
the
deerhide
door.
Outside,
the
rain
seemed
to
have
slackened.
Tents
had
gone
up
all
over
the
compound.
Jon
could
see
the
tops
of
others
under
the
trees.

Dolorous
Edd
was
feeding
the
horses.
вЂњGive
the
wildling
an
axe,
why
not?вЂќ
He
pointed
out
MormontвЂ™s
weapon,
a
short-hafted
battle-axe
with
gold
scrollwork
inlaid
on
the
black
steel
blade.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
give
it
back,
I
vow.
Buried
in
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
skull,
like
as
not.
Why
not
give
him
all
our
axes,
and
our
swords
as
well?
I
mislike
the
way
they
clank
and
rattle
as
we
ride.
WeвЂ™d
travel
faster
without
them,
straight
to
hellвЂ™s
door.
Does
it
rain
in
hell,
I
wonder?
Perhaps
Craster
would
like
a
nice
hat
instead.вЂќ

Jon
smiled.
вЂњHe
wants
an
axe.
And
wine
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњSee,
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
clever.
If
we
get
the
wildling
well
and
truly
drunk,
perhaps
heвЂ™ll
only
cut
off
an
ear
when
he
tries
to
slay
us
with
that
axe.
I
have
two
ears
but
only
one
head.вЂќ

вЂњSmallwood
says
Craster
is
a
friend
to
the
Watch.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
know
the
difference
between
a
wildling
whoвЂ™s
a
friend
to
the
Watch
and
one
whoвЂ™s
not?вЂќ
asked
the
dour
squire.
вЂњOur
enemies
leave
our
bodies
for
the
crows
and
the
wolves.
Our
friends
bury
us
in
secret
graves.
I
wonder
how
long
that
bearвЂ™s
been
nailed
up
on
that
gate,
and
what
Craster
had
there
before
we
came
hallooing?вЂќ
Edd
looked
at
the
axe
doubtfully,
the
rain
running
down
his
long
face.
вЂњIs
it
dry
in
there?вЂќ

вЂњDrier
than
out
here.вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
lurk
about
after,
not
too
close
to
the
fire,
belike
theyвЂ™ll
take
no
note
of
me
till
morn.
The
ones
under
his
roof
will
be
the
first
he
murders,
but
at
least
weвЂ™ll
die
dry.вЂќ

Jon
had
to
laugh.
вЂњCrasterвЂ™s
one
man.
WeвЂ™re
two
hundred.
I
doubt
heвЂ™ll
murder
anyone.вЂќ

вЂњYou
cheer
me,вЂќ
said
Edd,
sounding
utterly
morose.
вЂњAnd
besides,
thereвЂ™s
much
to
be
said
for
a
good
sharp
axe.
IвЂ™d
hate
to
be
murdered
with
a
maul.
I
saw
a
man
hit
in
the
brow
with
a
maul
once.
Scarce
split
the
skin
at
all,
but
his
head
turned
mushy
and
swelled
up
big
as
a
gourd,
only
purply-red.
A
comely
man,
but
he
died
ugly.
ItвЂ™s
good
that
weвЂ™re
not
giving
them
mauls.вЂќ
Edd
walked
away
shaking
his
head,
his
sodden
black
cloak
shedding
rain
behind
him.

Jon
got
the
horses
fed
before
he
stopped
to
think
of
his
own
supper.
He
was
wondering
where
to
find
Sam
when
he
heard
a
shout
of
fear.
вЂњWolf!вЂќ
He
sprinted
around
the
hall
toward
the
cry,
the
earth
sucking
at
his
boots.
One
of
CrasterвЂ™s
women
was
backed
up
against
the
mud-spattered
wall
of
the
keep.
вЂњKeep
away,вЂќ
she
was
shouting
at
Ghost.
вЂњYou
keep
away!вЂќ
The
direwolf
had
a
rabbit
in
his
mouth
and
another
dead
and
bloody
on
the
ground
before
him.
вЂњGet
it
away,
mвЂ™lord,вЂќ
she
pleaded
when
she
saw
him.

вЂњHe
wonвЂ™t
hurt
you.вЂќ
He
knew
at
once
what
had
happened;
a
wooden
hutch,
its
slats
shattered,
lay
on
its
side
in
the
wet
grass.
вЂњHe
must
have
been
hungry.
We
havenвЂ™t
seen
much
game.вЂќ
Jon
whistled.
The
direwolf
bolted
down
the
rabbit,
crunching
the
small
bones
between
his
teeth,
and
padded
over
to
him.

The
woman
regarded
them
with
nervous
eyes.
She
was
younger
than
heвЂ™d
thought
at
first.
A
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years,
he
judged,
dark
hair
plastered
across
a
gaunt
face
by
the
falling
rain,
her
bare
feet
muddy
to
the
ankles.
The
body
under
the
sewn
skins
was
showing
in
the
early
turns
of
pregnancy.
вЂњAre
you
one
of
CrasterвЂ™s
daughters?вЂќ
he
asked.

She
put
a
hand
over
her
belly.
вЂњWife
now.вЂќ
Edging
away
from
the
wolf,
she
knelt
mournfully
beside
the
broken
hutch.
вЂњI
was
going
to
breed
them
rabbits.
ThereвЂ™s
no
sheep
left.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Watch
will
make
good
for
them.вЂќ
Jon
had
no
coin
of
his
own,
or
he
would
have
offered
it
to
herвЂ¦
though
he
was
not
sure
what
good
a
few
coppers
or
even
a
silver
piece
would
do
her
beyond
the
Wall.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
speak
to
Lord
Mormont
on
the
morrow.вЂќ

She
wiped
her
hands
on
her
skirt.
вЂњMвЂ™lordвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
no
lord.вЂќ

But
others
had
come
crowding
round,
drawn
by
the
womanвЂ™s
scream
and
the
crash
of
the
rabbit
hutch.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
you
believe
him,
girl,вЂќ
called
out
Lark
the
Sisterman,
a
ranger
mean
as
a
cur.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
Lord
Snow
himself.вЂќ

вЂњBastard
of
Winterfell
and
brother
to
kings,вЂќ
mocked
Chett,
whoвЂ™d
left
his
hounds
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
about.

вЂњThat
wolfвЂ™s
looking
at
you
hungry,
girl,вЂќ
Lark
said.
вЂњMight
be
it
fancies
that
tender
bit
in
your
belly.вЂќ

Jon
was
not
amused.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
scaring
her.вЂќ

вЂњWarning
her,
more
like.вЂќ
ChettвЂ™s
grin
was
as
ugly
as
the
boils
that
covered
most
of
his
face.

вЂњWeвЂ™re
not
to
talk
to
you,вЂќ
the
girl
remembered
suddenly.

вЂњWait,вЂќ
Jon
said,
too
late.
She
bolted,
ran.

Lark
made
a
grab
for
the
second
rabbit,
but
Ghost
was
quicker.
When
he
bared
his
teeth,
the
Sisterman
slipped
in
the
mud
and
went
down
on
his
bony
butt.
The
others
laughed.
The
direwolf
took
the
rabbit
in
his
mouth
and
brought
it
to
Jon.

вЂњThere
was
no
call
to
scare
the
girl,вЂќ
he
told
them.

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
hear
no
scolds
from
you,
bastard.вЂќ
Chett
blamed
Jon
for
the
loss
of
his
comfortable
position
with
Maester
Aemon,
and
not
without
justice.
If
he
had
not
gone
to
Aemon
about
Sam
Tarly,
Chett
would
still
be
tending
an
old
blind
man
instead
of
a
pack
of
ill-tempered
hunting
hounds.
вЂњYou
may
be
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
pet,
but
youвЂ™re
not
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ¦
and
you
wouldnвЂ™t
talk
so
bloody
bold
without
that
monster
of
yours
always
about.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
not
fight
a
brother
while
weвЂ™re
beyond
the
Wall,вЂќ
Jon
answered,
his
voice
cooler
than
he
felt.

Lark
got
to
one
knee.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
afraid
of
you,
Chett.
On
the
Sisters,
we
have
a
name
for
them
like
him.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
all
the
names.
Save
your
breath.вЂќ
He
walked
away,
Ghost
at
his
side.
The
rain
had
dwindled
to
a
thin
drizzle
by
the
time
he
reached
the
gate.
Dusk
would
be
on
them
soon,
followed
by
another
wet
dark
dismal
night.
The
clouds
would
hide
moon
and
stars
and
MormontвЂ™s
Torch,
turning
the
woods
black
as
pitch.
Every
piss
would
be
an
adventure,
if
not
quite
of
the
sort
Jon
Snow
had
once
envisioned.

Out
under
the
trees,
some
rangers
had
found
enough
duff
and
dry
wood
to
start
a
fire
beneath
a
slanting
ridge
of
slate.
Others
had
raised
tents
or
made
rude
shelters
by
stretching
their
cloaks
over
low
branches.
Giant
had
crammed
himself
inside
the
hollow
of
a
dead
oak.
вЂњHow
dвЂ™ye
like
my
castle,
Lord
Snow?вЂќ

вЂњIt
looks
snug.
You
know
where
Sam
is?вЂќ

вЂњKeep
on
the
way
you
were.
If
you
come
on
Ser
OttynвЂ™s
pavilion,
youвЂ™ve
gone
too
far.вЂќ
Giant
smiled.
вЂњUnless
SamвЂ™s
found
him
a
tree
too.
What
a
tree
that
would
be.вЂќ

It
was
Ghost
who
found
Sam
in
the
end.
The
direwolf
shot
ahead
like
a
quarrel
from
a
crossbow.
Under
an
outcrop
of
rock
that
gave
some
small
degree
of
shelter
from
the
rain,
Sam
was
feeding
the
ravens.
His
boots
squished
when
he
moved.
вЂњMy
feet
are
soaked
through,вЂќ
he
admitted
miserably.
вЂњWhen
I
climbed
off
my
horse,
I
stepped
in
a
hole
and
went
in
up
to
my
knees.вЂќ

вЂњTake
off
your
boots
and
dry
your
stockings.
IвЂ™ll
find
some
dry
wood.
If
the
groundвЂ™s
not
wet
under
the
rock,
we
might
be
able
to
get
a
fire
burning.вЂќ
Jon
showed
Sam
the
rabbit.
вЂњAnd
weвЂ™ll
feast.вЂќ

вЂњWonвЂ™t
you
be
attending
Lord
Mormont
in
the
hall?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
but
you
will.
The
Old
Bear
wants
you
to
map
for
him.
Craster
says
heвЂ™ll
find
Mance
Rayder
for
us.вЂќ

вЂњOh.вЂќ
Sam
did
not
look
anxious
to
meet
Craster,
even
if
it
meant
a
warm
fire.

вЂњHe
said
eat
first,
though.
Dry
your
feet.вЂќ
Jon
went
to
gather
fuel,
digging
down
under
deadfalls
for
the
drier
wood
beneath
and
peeling
back
layers
of
sodden
pine
needles
until
he
found
likely
kindling.
Even
then,
it
seemed
to
take
forever
for
a
spark
to
catch.
He
hung
his
cloak
from
the
rock
to
keep
the
rain
off
his
smoky
little
fire,
making
them
a
small
snug
alcove.

As
he
knelt
to
skin
the
rabbit,
Sam
pulled
off
his
boots.
вЂњI
think
thereвЂ™s
moss
growing
between
my
toes,вЂќ
he
declared
mournfully,
wriggling
the
toes
in
question.
вЂњThe
rabbit
will
taste
good.
I
donвЂ™t
even
mind
about
the
blood
and
all.вЂќ
He
looked
away.
вЂњWell,
only
a
littleвЂ¦вЂќ

Jon
spitted
the
carcass,
banked
the
fire
with
a
pair
of
rocks,
and
balanced
their
meal
atop
them.
The
rabbit
had
been
a
scrawny
thing,
but
as
it
cooked
it
smelled
like
a
kingвЂ™s
feast.
Other
rangers
gave
them
envious
looks.
Even
Ghost
looked
up
hungrily,
flames
shining
in
his
red
eyes
as
he
sniffed.
вЂњYou
had
yours
before,вЂќ
Jon
reminded
him.

вЂњIs
Craster
as
savage
as
the
rangers
say?вЂќ
Sam
asked.
The
rabbit
was
a
shade
underdone,
but
tasted
wonderful.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
his
castle
like?вЂќ

вЂњA
midden
heap
with
a
roof
and
a
firepit.вЂќ
Jon
told
Sam
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
in
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep.

By
the
time
the
telling
was
done,
it
was
dark
outside
and
Sam
was
licking
his
fingers.
вЂњThat
was
good,
but
now
IвЂ™d
like
a
leg
of
lamb.
A
whole
leg,
just
for
me,
sauced
with
mint
and
honey
and
cloves.
Did
you
see
any
lambs?вЂќ

вЂњThere
was
a
sheepfold,
but
no
sheep.вЂќ

вЂњHow
does
he
feed
all
his
men?вЂќ

вЂњI
didnвЂ™t
see
any
men.
Just
Craster
and
his
women
and
a
few
small
girls.
I
wonder
heвЂ™s
able
to
hold
the
place.
His
defenses
were
nothing
to
speak
of,
only
a
muddy
dike.
You
had
better
go
up
to
the
hall
and
draw
that
map.
Can
you
find
the
way?вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
donвЂ™t
fall
in
the
mud.вЂќ
Sam
struggled
back
into
his
boots,
collected
quill
and
parchment,
and
shouldered
out
into
the
night,
the
rain
pattering
down
on
his
cloak
and
floppy
hat.

Ghost
laid
his
head
on
his
paws
and
went
to
sleep
by
the
fire.
Jon
stretched
out
beside
him,
grateful
for
the
warmth.
He
was
cold
and
wet,
but
not
so
cold
and
wet
as
heвЂ™d
been
a
short
time
before.
Perhaps
tonight
the
Old
Bear
will
learn
something
that
will
lead
us
to
Uncle
Benjen.

He
woke
to
the
sight
of
his
own
breath
misting
in
the
cold
morning
air.
When
he
moved,
his
bones
ached.
Ghost
was
gone,
the
fire
burnt
out.
Jon
reached
to
pull
aside
the
cloak
heвЂ™d
hung
over
the
rock,
and
found
it
stiff
and
frozen.
He
crept
beneath
it
and
stood
up
in
a
forest
turned
to
crystal.

The
pale
pink
light
of
dawn
sparkled
on
branch
and
leaf
and
stone.
Every
blade
of
grass
was
carved
from
emerald,
every
drip
of
water
turned
to
diamond.
Flowers
and
mushrooms
alike
wore
coats
of
glass.
Even
the
mud
puddles
had
a
bright
brown
sheen.
Through
the
shimmering
greenery,
the
black
tents
of
his
brothers
were
encased
in
a
fine
glaze
of
ice.

So
there
is
magic
beyond
the
Wall
after
all.
He
found
himself
thinking
of
his
sisters,
perhaps
because
heвЂ™d
dreamed
of
them
last
night.
Sansa
would
call
this
an
enchantment,
and
tears
would
fill
her
eyes
at
the
wonder
of
it,
but
Arya
would
run
out
laughing
and
shouting,
wanting
to
touch
it
all.

вЂњLord
Snow?вЂќ
he
heard.
Soft
and
meek.
He
turned.

Crouched
atop
the
rock
that
had
sheltered
him
during
the
night
was
the
rabbit
keeper,
wrapped
in
a
black
cloak
so
large
it
drowned
her.
SamвЂ™s
cloak,
Jon
realized
at
once.
Why
is
she
wearing
SamвЂ™s
cloak?
вЂњThe
fat
one
told
me
IвЂ™d
find
you
here,
mвЂ™lord,вЂќ
she
said.

вЂњWe
ate
the
rabbit,
if
thatвЂ™s
what
you
came
for.вЂќ
The
admission
made
him
feel
absurdly
guilty.

вЂњOld
Lord
Crow,
him
with
the
talking
bird,
he
gave
Craster
a
crossbow
worth
a
hundred
rabbits.вЂќ
Her
arms
closed
over
the
swell
of
her
belly.
вЂњIs
it
true,
mвЂ™lord?
Are
you
brother
to
a
king?вЂќ

вЂњA
half
brother,вЂќ
he
admitted.
вЂњIвЂ™m
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
bastard.
My
brother
Robb
is
the
King
in
the
North.
Why
are
you
here?вЂќ

вЂњThe
fat
one,
that
Sam,
he
said
to
see
you.
He
give
me
his
cloak,
so
no
one
would
say
I
didnвЂ™t
belong.вЂќ

вЂњWonвЂ™t
Craster
be
angry
with
you?вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
drank
overmuch
of
the
Lord
CrowвЂ™s
wine
last
night.
HeвЂ™ll
sleep
most
of
the
day.вЂќ
Her
breath
frosted
the
air
in
small
nervous
puffs.
вЂњThey
say
the
king
gives
justice
and
protects
the
weak.вЂќ
She
started
to
climb
off
the
rock,
awkwardly,
but
the
ice
had
made
it
slippery
and
her
foot
went
out
from
under
her.
Jon
caught
her
before
she
could
fall,
and
helped
her
safely
down.
The
woman
knelt
on
the
icy
ground.
вЂњMвЂ™lord,
I
beg
youвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
beg
me
anything.
Go
back
to
your
hall,
you
shouldnвЂ™t
be
here.
We
were
commanded
not
to
speak
to
CrasterвЂ™s
women.вЂќ

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
have
to
speak
with
me,
mвЂ™lord.
Just
take
me
with
you,
when
you
go,
thatвЂ™s
all
I
ask.вЂќ

All
she
asks,
he
thought.
As
if
that
were
nothing.

вЂњIвЂ™llвЂ¦
IвЂ™ll
be
your
wife,
if
you
like.
My
father,
heвЂ™s
got
nineteen
now,
one
less
wonвЂ™t
hurt
him
none.вЂќ

вЂњBlack
brothers
are
sworn
never
to
take
wives,
donвЂ™t
you
know
that?
And
weвЂ™re
guests
in
your
fatherвЂ™s
hall
besides.вЂќ

вЂњNot
you,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњI
watched.
You
never
ate
at
his
board,
nor
slept
by
his
fire.
He
never
gave
you
guest-right,
so
youвЂ™re
not
bound
to
him.
ItвЂ™s
for
the
baby
I
have
to
go.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
even
know
your
name.вЂќ

вЂњGilly,
he
called
me.
For
the
gillyflower.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
pretty.вЂќ
He
remembered
Sansa
telling
him
once
that
he
should
say
that
whenever
a
lady
told
him
her
name.
He
could
not
help
the
girl,
but
perhaps
the
courtesy
would
please
her.
вЂњIs
it
Craster
who
frightens
you,
Gilly?вЂќ

вЂњFor
the
baby,
not
for
me.
If
itвЂ™s
a
girl,
thatвЂ™s
not
so
bad,
sheвЂ™ll
grow
a
few
years
and
heвЂ™ll
marry
her.
But
Nella
says
itвЂ™s
to
be
a
boy,
and
sheвЂ™s
had
six
and
knows
these
things.
He
gives
the
boys
to
the
gods.
Come
the
white
cold,
he
does,
and
of
late
it
comes
more
often.
ThatвЂ™s
why
he
started
giving
them
sheep,
even
though
he
has
a
taste
for
mutton.
Only
now
the
sheepвЂ™s
gone
too.
Next
it
will
be
dogs,
tillвЂ¦вЂќ
She
lowered
her
eyes
and
stroked
her
belly.

вЂњWhat
gods?вЂќ
Jon
was
remembering
that
theyвЂ™d
seen
no
boys
in
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep,
nor
men
either,
save
Craster
himself.

вЂњThe
cold
gods,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњThe
ones
in
the
night.
The
white
shadows.вЂќ

And
suddenly
Jon
was
back
in
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
Tower
again.
A
severed
hand
was
climbing
his
calf
and
when
he
pried
it
off
with
the
point
of
his
longsword,
it
lay
writhing,
fingers
opening
and
closing.
The
dead
man
rose
to
his
feet,
blue
eyes
shining
in
that
gashed
and
swollen
face.
Ropes
of
torn
flesh
hung
from
the
great
wound
in
his
belly,
yet
there
was
no
blood.

вЂњWhat
color
are
their
eyes?вЂќ
he
asked
her.

вЂњBlue.
As
bright
as
blue
stars,
and
as
cold.вЂќ

She
has
seen
them,
he
thought.
Craster
lied.

вЂњWill
you
take
me?
Just
so
far
as
the
WallвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWe
do
not
ride
for
the
Wall.
We
ride
north,
after
Mance
Rayder
and
these
Others,
these
white
shadows
and
their
wights.
We
seek
them,
Gilly.
Your
babe
would
not
be
safe
with
us.вЂќ

Her
fear
was
plain
on
her
face.
вЂњYou
will
come
back,
though.
When
your
warringвЂ™s
done,
youвЂ™ll
pass
this
way
again.вЂќ

вЂњWe
may.вЂќ
If
any
of
us
still
live.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
for
the
Old
Bear
to
say,
the
one
you
call
the
Lord
Crow.
IвЂ™m
only
his
squire.
I
do
not
choose
the
road
I
ride.вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
He
could
hear
the
defeat
in
her
voice.
вЂњSorry
to
be
of
trouble,
mвЂ™lord.
I
onlyвЂ¦
they
said
the
king
keeps
people
safe,
and
I
thoughtвЂ¦вЂќ
Despairing,
she
ran,
SamвЂ™s
cloak
flapping
behind
her
like
great
black
wings.

Jon
watched
her
go,
his
joy
in
the
morningвЂ™s
brittle
beauty
gone.
Damn
her,
he
thought
resentfully,
and
damn
Sam
twice
for
sending
her
to
me.
What
did
he
think
I
could
do
for
her?
WeвЂ™re
here
to
fight
wildlings,
not
save
them.

Other
men
were
crawling
from
their
shelters,
yawning
and
stretching.
The
magic
was
already
faded,
icy
brightness
turning
back
to
common
dew
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun.
Someone
had
gotten
a
fire
started;
he
could
smell
woodsmoke
drifting
through
the
trees,
and
the
smoky
scent
of
bacon.
Jon
took
down
his
cloak
and
snapped
it
against
the
rock,
shattering
the
thin
crust
of
ice
that
had
formed
in
the
night,
then
gathered
up
Longclaw
and
shrugged
an
arm
through
a
shoulder
strap.
A
few
yards
away
he
made
water
into
a
frozen
bush,
his
piss
steaming
in
the
cold
air
and
melting
the
ice
wherever
it
fell.
Afterward
he
laced
up
his
black
wool
breeches
and
followed
the
smells.

Grenn
and
Dywen
were
among
the
brothers
who
had
gathered
round
the
fire.
Hake
handed
Jon
a
hollow
heel
of
bread
filled
with
burnt
bacon
and
chunks
of
salt
fish
warmed
in
bacon
grease.
He
wolfed
it
down
while
listening
to
Dywen
boast
of
having
three
of
CrasterвЂ™s
women
during
the
night.

вЂњYou
did
not,вЂќ
Grenn
said,
scowling.
вЂњI
would
have
seen.вЂќ

Dywen
whapped
him
up
alongside
his
ear
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњYou?
Seen?
YouвЂ™re
blind
as
Maester
Aemon.
You
never
even
saw
that
bear.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
bear?
Was
there
a
bear?вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
always
a
bear,вЂќ
declared
Dolorous
Edd
in
his
usual
tone
of
gloomy
resignation.
вЂњOne
killed
my
brother
when
I
was
young.
Afterward
it
wore
his
teeth
around
its
neck
on
a
leather
thong.
And
they
were
good
teeth
too,
better
than
mine.
IвЂ™ve
had
nothing
but
trouble
with
my
teeth.вЂќ

вЂњDid
Sam
sleep
in
the
hall
last
night?вЂќ
Jon
asked
him.

вЂњIвЂ™d
not
call
it
sleeping.
The
ground
was
hard,
the
rushes
ill-smelling,
and
my
brothers
snore
frightfully.
Speak
of
bears
if
you
will,
none
ever
growled
so
fierce
as
Brown
Bernarr.
I
was
warm,
though.
Some
dogs
crawled
atop
me
during
the
night.
My
cloak
was
almost
dry
when
one
of
them
pissed
in
it.
Or
perhaps
it
was
Brown
Bernarr.
Have
you
noticed
that
the
rain
stopped
the
instant
I
had
a
roof
above
me?
It
will
start
again
now
that
IвЂ™m
back
out.
Gods
and
dogs
alike
delight
to
piss
on
me.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
best
go
see
to
Lord
Mormont,вЂќ
said
Jon.

The
rain
might
have
stopped,
but
the
compound
was
still
a
morass
of
shallow
lakes
and
slippery
mud.
Black
brothers
were
folding
their
tents,
feeding
their
horses,
and
chewing
on
strips
of
salt
beef.
Jarman
BuckwellвЂ™s
scouts
were
tightening
the
girths
on
their
saddles
before
setting
out.
вЂњJon,вЂќ
Buckwell
greeted
him
from
horseback.
вЂњKeep
a
good
edge
on
that
bastard
sword
of
yours.
WeвЂ™ll
be
needing
it
soon
enough.вЂќ

CrasterвЂ™s
hall
was
dim
after
daylight.
Inside,
the
nightвЂ™s
torches
had
burned
low,
and
it
was
hard
to
know
that
the
sun
had
risen.
Lord
MormontвЂ™s
raven
was
the
first
to
spy
him
enter.
Three
lazy
flaps
of
its
great
black
wings,
and
it
perched
atop
LongclawвЂ™s
hilt.
вЂњCorn?вЂќ
It
nipped
at
a
strand
of
JonвЂ™s
hair.

вЂњIgnore
that
wretched
beggar
bird,
Jon,
itвЂ™s
just
had
half
my
bacon.вЂќ
The
Old
Bear
sat
at
CrasterвЂ™s
board,
breaking
his
fast
with
the
other
officers
on
fried
bread,
bacon,
and
sheepgut
sausage.
CrasterвЂ™s
new
axe
was
on
the
table,
its
gold
inlay
gleaming
faintly
in
the
torchlight.
Its
owner
was
sprawled
unconscious
in
the
sleeping
loft
above,
but
the
women
were
all
up,
moving
about
and
serving.
вЂњWhat
sort
of
day
do
we
have?вЂќ

вЂњCold,
but
the
rain
has
stopped.вЂќ

вЂњVery
good.
See
that
my
horse
is
saddled
and
ready.
I
mean
for
us
to
ride
within
the
hour.
Have
you
eaten?
Craster
serves
plain
fare,
but
filling.вЂќ

I
will
not
eat
CrasterвЂ™s
food,
he
decided
suddenly.
вЂњI
broke
my
fast
with
the
men,
my
lord.вЂќ
Jon
shooed
the
raven
off
Longclaw.
The
bird
hopped
back
to
MormontвЂ™s
shoulder,
where
it
promptly
shat.
вЂњYou
might
have
done
that
on
Snow
instead
of
saving
it
for
me,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
grumbled.
The
raven
quorked.

He
found
Sam
behind
the
hall,
standing
with
Gilly
at
the
broken
rabbit
hutch.
She
was
helping
him
back
into
his
cloak,
but
when
she
saw
Jon
she
stole
away.
Sam
gave
him
a
look
of
wounded
reproach.
вЂњI
thought
you
would
help
her.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
how
was
I
to
do
that?вЂќ
Jon
said
sharply.
вЂњTake
her
with
us,
wrapped
up
in
your
cloak?
We
were
commanded
not
toвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
know,вЂќ
said
Sam
guiltily,
вЂњbut
she
was
afraid.
I
know
what
it
is
to
be
afraid.
I
told
herвЂ¦вЂќ
He
swallowed.

вЂњWhat?
That
weвЂ™d
take
her
with
us?вЂќ

SamвЂ™s
fat
face
blushed
a
deep
red.
вЂњOn
the
way
home.вЂќ
He
could
not
meet
JonвЂ™s
eyes.
вЂњSheвЂ™s
going
to
have
a
baby.вЂќ

вЂњSam,
have
you
taken
leave
of
all
your
sense?
We
may
not
even
return
this
way.
And
if
we
do,
do
you
think
the
Old
Bear
is
going
to
let
you
pack
off
one
of
CrasterвЂ™s
wives?вЂќ

вЂњI
thoughtвЂ¦
maybe
by
then
I
could
think
of
a
wayвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
have
no
time
for
this,
I
have
horses
to
groom
and
saddle.вЂќ
Jon
walked
away
as
confused
as
he
was
angry.
SamвЂ™s
heart
was
a
big
as
the
rest
of
him,
but
for
all
his
reading
he
could
be
as
thick
as
Grenn
at
times.
It
was
impossible,
and
dishonorable
besides.
So
why
do
I
feel
so
ashamed?

Jon
took
his
accustomed
position
at
MormontвЂ™s
side
as
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
streamed
out
past
the
skulls
on
CrasterвЂ™s
gate.
They
struck
off
north
and
west
along
a
crooked
game
trail.
Melting
ice
dripped
down
all
about
them,
a
slower
sort
of
rain
with
its
own
soft
music.
North
of
the
compound,
the
brook
was
in
full
spate,
choked
with
leaves
and
bits
of
wood,
but
the
scouts
had
found
where
the
ford
lay
and
the
column
was
able
to
splash
across.
The
water
ran
as
high
as
a
horseвЂ™s
belly.
Ghost
swam,
emerging
on
the
bank
with
his
white
fur
dripping
brown.
When
he
shook,
spraying
mud
and
water
in
all
directions,
Mormont
said
nothing,
but
on
his
shoulder
the
raven
screeched.

вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
Jon
said
quietly
as
the
wood
closed
in
around
them
once
more.
вЂњCraster
has
no
sheep.
Nor
any
sons.вЂќ

Mormont
made
no
answer.

вЂњAt
Winterfell
one
of
the
serving
women
told
us
stories,вЂќ
Jon
went
on.
вЂњShe
used
to
say
that
there
were
wildlings
who
would
lay
with
the
Others
to
birth
half-human
children.вЂќ

вЂњHearth
tales.
Does
Craster
seem
less
than
human
to
you?вЂќ

In
half
a
hundred
ways.
вЂњHe
gives
his
sons
to
the
wood.вЂќ

A
long
silence.
Then:
вЂњYes.вЂќ
And
вЂњYes,вЂќ
the
raven
muttered,
strutting.
вЂњYes,
yes,
yes.вЂќ

вЂњYou
knew?вЂќ

вЂњSmallwood
told
me.
Long
ago.
All
the
rangers
know,
though
few
will
talk
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњDid
my
uncle
know?вЂќ

вЂњAll
the
rangers,вЂќ
Mormont
repeated.
вЂњYou
think
I
ought
to
stop
him.
Kill
him
if
need
be.вЂќ
The
Old
Bear
sighed.
вЂњWere
it
only
that
he
wished
to
rid
himself
of
some
mouths,
IвЂ™d
gladly
send
Yoren
or
Conwys
to
collect
the
boys.
We
could
raise
them
to
the
black
and
the
Watch
would
be
that
much
the
stronger.
But
the
wildlings
serve
crueler
gods
than
you
or
I.
These
boys
are
CrasterвЂ™s
offerings.
His
prayers,
if
you
will.вЂќ

His
wives
must
offer
different
prayers,
Jon
thought.

вЂњHow
is
it
you
came
to
know
this?вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
asked
him.
вЂњFrom
one
of
CrasterвЂ™s
wives?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lord,вЂќ
Jon
confessed.
вЂњI
would
sooner
not
tell
you
which.
She
was
frightened
and
wanted
help.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wide
world
is
full
of
people
wanting
help,
Jon.
Would
that
some
could
find
the
courage
to
help
themselves.
Craster
sprawls
in
his
loft
even
now,
stinking
of
wine
and
lost
to
sense.
On
his
board
below
lies
a
sharp
new
axe.
Were
it
me,
IвЂ™d
name
it
вЂAnswered
PrayerвЂ™
and
make
an
end.вЂќ

Yes.
Jon
thought
of
Gilly.
She
and
her
sisters.
They
were
nineteen,
and
Craster
was
one,
butвЂ¦

вЂњYet
it
would
be
an
ill
day
for
us
if
Craster
died.
Your
uncle
could
tell
you
of
the
times
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep
made
the
difference
between
life
and
death
for
our
rangers.вЂќ

вЂњMy
fatherвЂ¦вЂќ
He
hesitated.

вЂњGo
on,
Jon.
Say
what
you
would
say.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
once
told
me
that
some
men
are
not
worth
having,вЂќ
Jon
finished.
вЂњA
bannerman
who
is
brutal
or
unjust
dishonors
his
liege
lord
as
well
as
himself.вЂќ

вЂњCraster
is
his
own
man.
He
has
sworn
us
no
vows.
Nor
is
he
subject
to
our
laws.
Your
heart
is
noble,
Jon,
but
learn
a
lesson
here.
We
cannot
set
the
world
to
rights.
That
is
not
our
purpose.
The
NightвЂ™s
Watch
has
other
wars
to
fight.вЂќ

Other
wars.
Yes.
I
must
remember.
вЂњJarman
Buckwell
said
I
might
have
need
of
my
sword
soon.вЂќ

вЂњDid
he?вЂќ
Mormont
did
not
seem
pleased.
вЂњCraster
said
much
and
more
last
night,
and
confirmed
enough
of
my
fears
to
condemn
me
to
a
sleepless
night
on
his
floor.
Mance
Rayder
is
gathering
his
people
together
in
the
Frostfangs.
ThatвЂ™s
why
the
villages
are
empty.
It
is
the
same
tale
that
Ser
Denys
Mallister
had
from
the
wildling
his
men
captured
in
the
Gorge,
but
Craster
has
added
the
where,
and
that
makes
all
the
difference.вЂќ

вЂњIs
he
making
a
city,
or
an
army?вЂќ

вЂњNow,
that
is
the
question.
How
many
wildlings
are
there?
How
many
men
of
fighting
age?
No
one
knows
with
certainty.
The
Frostfangs
are
cruel,
inhospitable,
a
wilderness
of
stone
and
ice.
They
will
not
long
sustain
any
great
number
of
people.
I
can
see
only
one
purpose
in
this
gathering.
Mance
Rayder
means
to
strike
south,
into
the
Seven
Kingdoms.вЂќ

вЂњWildlings
have
invaded
the
realm
before.вЂќ
Jon
had
heard
the
tales
from
Old
Nan
and
Maester
Luwin
both,
back
at
Winterfell.
вЂњRaymun
Redbeard
led
them
south
in
the
time
of
my
grandfatherвЂ™s
grandfather,
and
before
him
there
was
a
king
named
Bael
the
Bard.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
and
long
before
them
came
the
Horned
Lord
and
the
brother
kings
Gendel
and
Gorne,
and
in
ancient
days
Joramun,
who
blew
the
Horn
of
Winter
and
woke
giants
from
the
earth.
Each
man
of
them
broke
his
strength
on
the
Wall,
or
was
broken
by
the
power
of
Winterfell
on
the
far
sideвЂ¦
but
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
is
only
a
shadow
of
what
we
were,
and
who
remains
to
oppose
the
wildlings
besides
us?
The
Lord
of
Winterfell
is
dead,
and
his
heir
has
marched
his
strength
south
to
fight
the
Lannisters.
The
wildlings
may
never
again
have
such
a
chance
as
this.
I
knew
Mance
Rayder,
Jon.
He
is
an
oathbreaker,
yesвЂ¦
but
he
has
eyes
to
see,
and
no
man
has
ever
dared
to
name
him
faintheart.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
will
we
do?вЂќ
asked
Jon.

вЂњFind
him,вЂќ
said
Mormont.
вЂњFight
him.
Stop
him.вЂќ

Three
hundred,
thought
Jon,
against
the
fury
of
the
wild.
His
fingers
opened
and
closed.





THEON

She
was
undeniably
a
beauty.
But
your
first
is
always
beautiful,
Theon
Greyjoy
thought.

вЂњNow
thereвЂ™s
a
pretty
grin,вЂќ
a
womanвЂ™s
voice
said
behind
him.
вЂњThe
lordling
likes
the
look
of
her,
does
he?вЂќ

Theon
turned
to
give
her
an
appraising
glance.
He
liked
what
he
saw.
Ironborn,
he
knew
at
a
glance;
lean
and
longlegged,
with
black
hair
cut
short,
wind-chafed
skin,
strong
sure
hands,
a
dirk
at
her
belt.
Her
nose
was
too
big
and
too
sharp
for
her
thin
face,
but
her
smile
made
up
for
it.
He
judged
her
a
few
years
older
than
he
was,
but
no
more
than
five-and-twenty.
She
moved
as
if
she
were
used
to
a
deck
beneath
her
feet.

вЂњYes,
sheвЂ™s
a
sweet
sight,вЂќ
he
told
her,
вЂњthough
not
half
so
sweet
as
you.вЂќ

вЂњOho.вЂќ
She
grinned.
вЂњIвЂ™d
best
be
careful.
This
lordling
has
a
honeyed
tongue.вЂќ

вЂњTaste
it
and
see.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
that
way,
then?вЂќ
she
said,
eyeing
him
boldly.
There
were
women
on
the
Iron
IslandsвЂ”not
many,
but
a
fewвЂ”who
crewed
the
longships
along
with
their
men,
and
it
was
said
that
salt
and
sea
changed
them,
gave
them
a
manвЂ™s
appetites.
вЂњHave
you
been
that
long
at
sea,
lordling?
Or
were
there
no
women
where
you
came
from?вЂќ

вЂњWomen
enough,
but
none
like
you.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
how
would
you
know
what
IвЂ™m
like?вЂќ

вЂњMy
eyes
can
see
your
face.
My
ears
can
hear
your
laughter.
And
my
cockвЂ™s
gone
hard
as
a
mast
for
you.вЂќ

The
woman
stepped
close
and
pressed
a
hand
to
the
front
of
his
breeches.
вЂњWell,
youвЂ™re
no
liar,вЂќ
she
said,
giving
him
a
squeeze
through
the
cloth.
вЂњHow
bad
does
it
hurt?вЂќ

вЂњFiercely.вЂќ

вЂњPoor
lordling.вЂќ
She
released
him
and
stepped
back.
вЂњAs
it
happens,
IвЂ™m
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
child.вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods
are
good,вЂќ
Theon
said.
вЂњNo
chance
IвЂ™d
give
you
a
bastard
that
way.вЂќ

вЂњEven
so,
my
man
wouldnвЂ™t
thank
you.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
but
you
might.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
why
would
that
be?
IвЂ™ve
had
lords
before.
TheyвЂ™re
made
the
same
as
other
men.вЂќ

вЂњHave
you
ever
had
a
prince?вЂќ
he
asked
her.
вЂњWhen
youвЂ™re
wrinkled
and
grey
and
your
teats
hang
past
your
belly,
you
can
tell
your
childrenвЂ™s
children
that
once
you
loved
a
king.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
is
it
love
weвЂ™re
talking
now?
And
here
I
thought
it
was
just
cocks
and
cunts.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
love
you
fancy?вЂќ
HeвЂ™d
decided
that
he
liked
this
wench,
whoever
she
was;
her
sharp
wit
was
a
welcome
respite
from
the
damp
gloom
of
Pyke.
вЂњShall
I
name
my
longship
after
you,
and
play
you
the
high
harp,
and
keep
you
in
a
tower
room
in
my
castle
with
only
jewels
to
wear,
like
a
princess
in
a
song?вЂќ

вЂњYou
ought
to
name
your
ship
after
me,вЂќ
she
said,
ignoring
all
the
rest.
вЂњIt
was
me
who
built
her.вЂќ

вЂњSigrin
built
her.
My
lord
fatherвЂ™s
shipwright.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
Esgred.
AmbrodeвЂ™s
daughter,
and
wife
to
Sigrin.вЂќ

He
had
not
known
that
Ambrode
had
a
daughter,
or
Sigrin
a
wifeвЂ¦
but
heвЂ™d
met
the
younger
shipwright
only
once,
and
the
older
one
he
scarce
remembered.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
wasted
on
Sigrin.вЂќ

вЂњOho.
Sigrin
told
me
this
sweet
ship
is
wasted
on
you.вЂќ

Theon
bristled.
вЂњDo
you
know
who
I
am?вЂќ

вЂњPrince
Theon
of
House
Greyjoy.
Who
else?
Tell
me
true,
my
lord,
how
well
do
you
love
her,
this
new
maid
of
yours?
Sigrin
will
want
to
know.вЂќ

The
longship
was
so
new
that
she
still
smelled
of
pitch
and
resin.
His
uncle
Aeron
would
bless
her
on
the
morrow,
but
Theon
had
ridden
over
from
Pyke
to
get
a
look
at
her
before
she
was
launched.
She
was
not
so
large
as
Lord
BalonвЂ™s
own
Great
Kraken
or
his
uncle
VictarionвЂ™s
Iron
Victory,
but
she
looked
swift
and
sweet,
even
sitting
in
her
wooden
cradle
on
the
strand;
lean
black
hull
a
hundred
feet
long,
a
single
tall
mast,
fifty
long
oars,
deck
enough
for
a
hundred
menвЂ¦
and
at
the
prow,
the
great
iron
ram
in
the
shape
of
an
arrowhead.
вЂњSigrin
did
me
good
service,вЂќ
he
admitted.
вЂњIs
she
as
fast
as
she
looks?вЂќ

вЂњFasterвЂ”for
a
master
that
knows
how
to
handle
her.вЂќ

вЂњIt
has
been
a
few
years
since
I
sailed
a
ship.вЂќ
And
IвЂ™ve
never
captained
one,
if
truth
be
told.
вЂњStill,
IвЂ™m
a
Greyjoy,
and
an
ironman.
The
sea
is
in
my
blood.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
your
blood
will
be
in
the
sea,
if
you
sail
the
way
you
talk,вЂќ
she
told
him.

вЂњI
would
never
mistreat
such
a
fair
maiden.вЂќ

вЂњFair
maiden?вЂќ
She
laughed.
вЂњSheвЂ™s
a
sea
bitch,
this
one.вЂќ

вЂњThere,
and
now
youвЂ™ve
named
her.
Sea
Bitch.вЂќ

That
amused
her;
he
could
see
the
sparkle
in
her
dark
eyes.
вЂњAnd
you
said
youвЂ™d
name
her
after
me,вЂќ
she
said
in
a
voice
of
wounded
reproach.

вЂњI
did.вЂќ
He
caught
her
hand.
вЂњHelp
me,
my
lady.
In
the
green
lands,
they
believe
a
woman
with
child
means
good
fortune
for
any
man
who
beds
her.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
would
they
know
about
ships
in
the
green
lands?
Or
women,
for
that
matter?
Besides,
I
think
you
made
that
up.вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
confess,
will
you
still
love
me?вЂќ

вЂњStill?
When
have
I
ever
loved
you?вЂќ

вЂњNever,вЂќ
he
admitted,
вЂњbut
I
am
trying
to
repair
that
lack,
my
sweet
Esgred.
The
wind
is
cold.
Come
aboard
my
ship
and
let
me
warm
you.
On
the
morrow
my
uncle
Aeron
will
pour
seawater
over
her
prow
and
mumble
a
prayer
to
the
Drowned
God,
but
IвЂ™d
sooner
bless
her
with
the
milk
of
my
loins,
and
yours.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Drowned
God
might
not
take
that
kindly.вЂќ

вЂњBugger
the
Drowned
God.
If
he
troubles
us,
IвЂ™ll
drown
him
again.
WeвЂ™re
off
to
war
within
a
fortnight.
Would
you
send
me
into
battle
all
sleepless
with
longing?вЂќ

вЂњGladly.вЂќ

вЂњA
cruel
maid.
My
ship
is
well
named.
If
I
steer
her
onto
the
rocks
in
my
distraction,
youвЂ™ll
have
yourself
to
blame.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
plan
to
steer
with
this?вЂќ
Esgred
brushed
the
front
of
his
breeches
once
more,
and
smiled
as
a
finger
traced
the
iron
outline
of
his
manhood.

вЂњCome
back
to
Pyke
with
me,вЂќ
he
said
suddenly,
thinking,
What
will
Lord
Balon
say?
And
why
should
I
care?
I
am
a
man
grown,
if
I
want
to
bring
a
wench
to
bed
it
is
no
oneвЂ™s
business
but
my
own.

вЂњAnd
what
would
I
do
in
Pyke?вЂќ
Her
hand
stayed
where
it
was.

вЂњMy
father
will
feast
his
captains
tonight.вЂќ
He
had
them
to
feast
every
night,
while
he
waited
for
the
last
stragglers
to
arrive,
but
Theon
saw
no
need
to
tell
all
that.

вЂњWould
you
make
me
your
captain
for
the
night,
my
lord
prince?вЂќ
She
had
the
wickedest
smile
heвЂ™d
ever
seen
on
a
woman.

вЂњI
might.
If
I
knew
youвЂ™d
steer
me
safe
into
port.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
I
know
which
end
of
the
oar
goes
in
the
sea,
and
thereвЂ™s
no
one
better
with
ropes
and
knots.вЂќ
One-handed,
she
undid
the
lacing
of
his
breeches,
then
grinned
and
stepped
lightly
away
from
him.
вЂњA
pity
IвЂ™m
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
child.вЂќ

Flustered,
Theon
laced
himself
back
up.
вЂњI
need
to
start
back
to
the
castle.
if
you
do
not
come
with
me,
I
may
lose
my
way
for
grief,
and
all
the
islands
would
be
poorer.вЂќ

вЂњWe
couldnвЂ™t
have
thatвЂ¦
but
I
have
no
horse,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњYou
could
take
my
squireвЂ™s
mount.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
leave
your
poor
squire
to
walk
all
the
way
to
Pyke?вЂќ

вЂњShare
mine,
then.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
like
that
well
enough.вЂќ
The
smile
again.
вЂњNow,
would
I
be
behind
you,
or
in
front?вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
be
wherever
you
liked.вЂќ

вЂњI
like
to
be
on
top.вЂќ

Where
has
this
wench
been
all
my
life?
вЂњMy
fatherвЂ™s
hall
is
dim
and
dank.
It
needs
Esgred
to
make
the
fires
blaze.вЂќ

вЂњThe
lordling
has
a
honeyed
tongue.вЂќ

вЂњIsnвЂ™t
that
where
we
began?вЂќ

She
threw
up
her
hands.
вЂњAnd
where
we
end.
Esgred
is
yours,
sweet
prince.
Take
me
to
your
castle.
Let
me
see
your
proud
towers
rising
from
the
sea.вЂќ

вЂњI
left
my
horse
at
the
inn.
Come.вЂќ
They
walked
down
the
strand
together,
and
when
Theon
took
her
arm,
she
did
not
pull
away.
He
liked
the
way
she
walked;
there
was
a
boldness
to
it,
part
saunter
and
part
sway,
that
suggested
she
would
be
just
as
bold
beneath
the
blankets.

Lordsport
was
as
crowded
as
heвЂ™d
ever
seen
it,
swarming
with
the
crews
of
the
longships
that
lined
the
pebbled
shore
and
rode
at
anchor
well
out
past
the
breakwater.
Ironmen
did
not
bend
their
knees
often
nor
easily,
but
Theon
noted
that
oarsmen
and
townfolk
alike
grew
quiet
as
they
passed,
and
acknowledged
him
with
respectful
bows
of
the
head.
They
have
finally
learned
who
I
am,
he
thought.
And
past
time
too.

Lord
Goodbrother
of
Great
Wyk
had
come
in
the
night
before
with
his
main
strength,
near
forty
longships.
His
men
were
everywhere,
conspicuous
in
their
striped
goatвЂ™s
hair
sashes.
It
was
said
about
the
inn
that
Otter
GimpkneeвЂ™s
whores
were
being
fucked
bowlegged
by
beardless
boys
in
sashes.
The
boys
were
welcome
to
them
so
far
as
Theon
was
concerned.
A
poxier
den
of
slatterns
he
hoped
heвЂ™d
never
see.
His
present
companion
was
more
to
his
taste.
That
she
was
wed
to
his
fatherвЂ™s
shipwright
and
pregnant
to
boot
only
made
her
more
intriguing.

вЂњHas
my
lord
prince
begun
choosing
his
crew?вЂќ
Esgred
asked
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
stable.
вЂњHo,
Bluetooth,вЂќ
she
shouted
to
a
passing
seafarer,
a
tall
man
in
bearskin
vest
and
raven-winged
helm.
вЂњHow
fares
your
bride?вЂќ

вЂњFat
with
child,
and
talking
of
twins.вЂќ

вЂњSo
soon?вЂќ
Esgred
smiled
that
wicked
smile.
вЂњYou
got
your
oar
in
the
water
quickly.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
and
stroked
and
stroked
and
stroked,вЂќ
roared
the
man.

вЂњA
big
man,вЂќ
Theon
observed.
вЂњBluetooth,
was
it?
Should
I
choose
him
for
my
Sea
Bitch?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
if
you
mean
to
insult
him.
Bluetooth
has
a
sweet
ship
of
his
own.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
been
too
long
away
to
know
one
man
from
another,вЂќ
Theon
admitted.
HeвЂ™d
looked
for
a
few
of
the
friends
heвЂ™d
played
with
as
a
boy,
but
they
were
gone,
dead,
or
grown
into
strangers.
вЂњMy
uncle
Victarion
has
loaned
me
his
own
steersman.вЂќ

вЂњRymolf
Stormdrunk?
A
good
man,
so
long
as
heвЂ™s
sober.вЂќ
She
saw
more
faces
she
knew,
and
called
out
to
a
passing
trio,
вЂњUller,
Qarl.
WhereвЂ™s
your
brother,
Skyte?вЂќ

вЂњThe
Drowned
God
needed
a
strong
oarsman,
I
fear,вЂќ
replied
the
stocky
man
with
the
white
streak
in
his
beard.

вЂњWhat
he
means
is,
Eldiss
drank
too
much
wine
and
his
fat
belly
burst,вЂќ
said
the
pink-cheeked
youth
beside
him.

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
dead
may
never
die,вЂќ
Esgred
said.

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
dead
may
never
die.вЂќ

Theon
muttered
the
words
with
them.
вЂњYou
seem
well
known,вЂќ
he
said
to
the
woman
when
the
men
had
passed
on.

вЂњEvery
man
loves
the
shipwrightвЂ™s
wife.
He
had
better,
lest
he
wants
his
ship
to
sink.
If
you
need
men
to
pull
your
oars,
you
could
do
worse
than
those
three.вЂќ

вЂњLordsport
has
no
lack
of
strong
arms.вЂќ
Theon
had
given
the
matter
no
little
thought.
It
was
fighters
he
wanted,
and
men
who
would
be
loyal
to
him,
not
to
his
lord
father
or
his
uncles.
He
was
playing
the
part
of
a
dutiful
young
prince
for
the
moment,
while
he
waited
for
Lord
Balon
to
reveal
the
fullness
of
his
plans.
If
it
turned
out
that
he
did
not
like
those
plans
or
his
part
in
them,
however,
wellвЂ¦

вЂњStrength
is
not
enough.
A
longshipвЂ™s
oars
must
move
as
one
if
you
would
have
her
best
speed.
Choose
men
who
have
rowed
together
before,
if
youвЂ™re
wise.вЂќ

вЂњSage
counsel.
Perhaps
youвЂ™d
help
me
choose
them.вЂќ
Let
her
believe
I
want
her
wisdom,
women
fancy
that.

вЂњI
may.
If
you
treat
me
kindly.вЂќ

вЂњHow
else?вЂќ

Theon
quickened
his
stride
as
they
neared
the
Myraham,
rocking
high
and
empty
by
the
quay.
Her
captain
had
tried
to
sail
a
fortnight
past,
but
Lord
Balon
would
not
permit
it.
None
of
the
merchantmen
that
called
at
Lordsport
had
been
allowed
to
depart
again;
his
father
wanted
no
word
of
the
hosting
to
reach
the
mainland
before
he
was
ready
to
strike.

вЂњMilord,вЂќ
a
plaintive
voice
called
down
from
the
forecastle
of
the
merchanter.
The
captainвЂ™s
daughter
leaned
over
the
rail,
gazing
after
him.
Her
father
had
forbidden
her
to
come
ashore,
but
whenever
Theon
came
to
Lordsport
he
spied
her
wandering
forlornly
about
the
deck.
вЂњMilord,
a
moment,вЂќ
she
called
after
him.
вЂњAs
it
please
milordвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњDid
she?вЂќ
Esgred
asked
as
Theon
hurried
her
past
the
cog.
вЂњPlease
milord?вЂќ

He
saw
no
sense
in
being
coy
with
this
one.
вЂњFor
a
time.
Now
she
wants
to
be
my
salt
wife.вЂќ

вЂњOho.
Well,
sheвЂ™d
profit
from
some
salting,
no
doubt.
Too
soft
and
bland,
that
one.
Or
am
I
wrong?вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
not
wrong.вЂќ
Soft
and
bland.
Precisely.
How
had
she
known?

He
had
told
Wex
to
wait
at
the
inn.
The
common
room
was
so
crowded
that
Theon
had
to
push
his
way
through
the
door.
Not
a
seat
was
to
be
had
at
bench
nor
table.
Nor
did
he
see
his
squire.
вЂњWexвЂќ,
he
shouted
over
the
din
and
clatter.
If
heвЂ™s
up
with
one
of
those
poxy
whores,
IвЂ™ll
strip
the
hide
off
him,
he
was
thinking
when
he
finally
spied
the
boy,
dicing
near
the
hearthвЂ¦
and
winning
too,
by
the
look
of
the
pile
of
coins
before
him.

вЂњTime
to
go,вЂќ
Theon
announced.
When
the
boy
paid
him
no
mind,
he
seized
him
by
the
ear
and
pulled
him
from
the
game.
Wex
grabbed
up
a
fistful
of
coppers
and
came
along
without
a
word.
That
was
one
of
the
things
Theon
liked
best
about
him.
Most
squires
have
loose
tongues,
but
Wex
had
been
born
dumbвЂ¦
which
didnвЂ™t
seem
to
keep
him
from
being
clever
as
any
twelve-year-old
had
a
right
to
be.
He
was
a
baseborn
son
of
one
of
Lord
BotleyвЂ™s
half
brothers.
Taking
him
as
squire
had
been
part
of
the
price
Theon
had
paid
for
his
horse.

When
Wex
saw
Esgred,
his
eyes
went
round.
YouвЂ™d
think
heвЂ™d
never
seen
a
woman
before,
Theon
thought.
вЂњEsgred
will
be
riding
with
me
back
to
Pyke.
Saddle
the
horses,
and
be
quick
about
it.вЂќ

The
boy
had
ridden
in
on
a
scrawny
little
garron
from
Lord
BalonвЂ™s
stable,
but
TheonвЂ™s
mount
was
quite
another
sort
of
beast.
вЂњWhere
did
you
find
that
hellhorse?вЂќ
Esgred
asked
when
she
saw
him,
but
from
the
way
she
laughed
he
knew
she
was
impressed.

вЂњLord
Botley
bought
him
in
Lannisport
a
year
past,
but
he
proved
to
be
too
much
horse
for
him,
so
Botley
was
pleased
to
sell.вЂќ
The
Iron
Islands
were
too
sparse
and
rocky
for
breeding
good
horses.
Most
of
the
islanders
were
indifferent
riders
at
best,
more
comfortable
on
the
deck
of
a
longship
than
in
the
saddle.
Even
the
lords
rode
garrons
or
shaggy
Harlaw
ponies,
and
ox
carts
were
more
common
than
drays.
The
smallfolk
too
poor
to
own
either
one
pulled
their
own
plows
through
the
thin,
stony
soil.

But
Theon
had
spent
ten
years
in
Winterfell,
and
did
not
intend
to
go
to
war
without
a
good
mount
beneath
him.
Lord
BotleyвЂ™s
misjudgment
was
his
good
fortune:
a
stallion
with
a
temper
as
black
as
his
hide,
larger
than
a
courser
if
not
quite
so
big
as
most
destriers.
As
Theon
was
not
quite
so
big
as
most
knights,
that
suited
him
admirably.
The
animal
had
fire
in
his
eyes.
When
heвЂ™d
met
his
new
owner,
heвЂ™d
pulled
back
his
lips
and
tried
to
bite
off
his
face.

вЂњDoes
he
have
a
name?вЂќ
Esgred
asked
Theon
as
he
mounted.

вЂњSmiler.вЂќ
He
gave
her
a
hand,
and
pulled
her
up
in
front
of
him,
where
he
could
put
his
arms
around
her
as
they
rode.
вЂњI
knew
a
man
once
who
told
me
that
I
smiled
at
the
wrong
things.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
by
the
lights
of
those
who
smile
at
nothing.вЂќ
He
thought
of
his
father
and
his
uncle
Aeron.

вЂњAre
you
smiling
now,
my
lord
prince?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
yes.вЂќ
Theon
reached
around
her
to
take
the
reins.
She
was
almost
of
a
height
with
him.
Her
hair
could
have
used
a
wash
and
she
had
a
faded
pink
scar
on
her
pretty
neck,
but
he
liked
the
smell
of
her,
salt
and
sweat
and
woman.

The
ride
back
to
Pyke
promised
to
be
a
good
deal
more
interesting
than
the
ride
down
had
been.

When
they
were
well
beyond
Lordsport,
Theon
put
a
hand
on
her
breast.
Esgred
reached
up
and
plucked
it
away.
вЂњIвЂ™d
keep
both
hands
on
the
reins,
or
this
black
beast
of
yours
is
like
to
fling
us
both
off
and
kick
us
to
death.вЂќ

вЂњI
broke
him
of
that.вЂќ
Amused,
Theon
behaved
himself
for
a
while,
chatting
amiably
of
the
weather
(grey
and
overcast,
as
it
had
been
since
he
arrived,
with
frequent
rains)
and
telling
her
of
the
men
heвЂ™d
killed
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
When
he
reached
the
part
about
coming
that
close
to
the
Kingslayer
himself,
he
slid
his
hand
back
up
to
where
it
had
been.
Her
breasts
were
small,
but
he
liked
the
firmness
of
them.

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
want
to
do
that,
my
lord
prince.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
but
I
do.вЂќ
Theon
gave
her
a
squeeze.

вЂњYour
squire
is
watching
you.вЂќ

вЂњLet
him.
HeвЂ™ll
never
speak
of
it,
I
swear.вЂќ

Esgred
pried
his
fingers
off
her
breast.
This
time
she
kept
him
firmly
prisoned.
She
had
strong
hands.

вЂњI
like
a
woman
with
a
good
tight
grip.вЂќ

She
snorted.
вЂњIвЂ™d
not
have
thought
it,
by
that
wench
on
the
waterfront.вЂќ

вЂњYou
must
not
judge
me
by
her.
She
was
the
only
woman
on
the
ship.вЂќ

вЂњTell
me
of
your
father.
Will
he
welcome
me
kindly
to
his
castle?вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
he?
He
scarcely
welcomed
me,
his
own
blood,
the
heir
to
Pyke
and
the
Iron
Islands.вЂќ

вЂњAre
you?вЂќ
she
asked
mildly.
вЂњItвЂ™s
said
that
you
have
uncles,
brothers,
a
sister.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brothers
are
long
dead,
and
my
sisterвЂ¦
well,
they
say
AshaвЂ™s
favorite
gown
is
a
chainmail
hauberk
that
hangs
down
past
her
knees,
with
boiled
leather
smallclothes
beneath.
MenвЂ™s
garb
wonвЂ™t
make
her
a
man,
though.
IвЂ™ll
make
a
good
marriage
alliance
with
her
once
weвЂ™ve
won
the
war,
if
I
can
find
a
man
to
take
her.
As
I
recall,
she
had
a
nose
like
a
vultureвЂ™s
beak,
a
ripe
crop
of
pimples,
and
no
more
chest
than
a
boy.вЂќ

вЂњYou
can
marry
off
your
sister,вЂќ
Esgred
observed,
вЂњbut
not
your
uncles.вЂќ

вЂњMy
unclesвЂ¦вЂќ
TheonвЂ™s
claim
took
precedence
over
those
of
his
fatherвЂ™s
three
brothers,
but
the
woman
had
touched
on
a
sore
point
nonetheless.
in
the
islands
it
was
scarce
unheard
of
for
a
strong,
ambitious
uncle
to
dispossess
a
weak
nephew
of
his
rights,
and
usually
murder
him
in
the
bargain.
But
I
am
not
weak,
Theon
told
himself,
and
I
mean
to
be
stronger
yet
by
the
time
my
father
dies.
вЂњMy
uncles
pose
no
threat
to
me,вЂќ
he
declared.
вЂњAeron
is
drunk
on
seawater
and
sanctity.
He
lives
only
for
his
godвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHis
god?
Not
yours?вЂќ

вЂњMine
as
well.
What
is
dead
can
never
die.вЂќ
He
smiled
thinly.
вЂњIf
I
make
pious
noises
as
required,
Damphair
will
give
me
no
trouble.
And
my
uncle
VictarionвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњLord
Captain
of
the
Iron
Fleet,
and
a
fearsome
warrior.
I
have
heard
them
sing
of
him
in
the
alehouses.вЂќ

вЂњDuring
my
lord
fatherвЂ™s
rebellion,
he
sailed
into
Lannisport
with
my
uncle
Euron
and
burned
the
Lannister
fleet
where
it
lay
at
anchor,вЂќ
Theon
recalled.
вЂњThe
plan
was
EuronвЂ™s,
though.
Victarion
is
like
some
great
grey
bullock,
strong
and
tireless
and
dutiful,
but
not
like
to
win
any
races.
No
doubt,
heвЂ™ll
serve
me
as
loyally
as
he
has
served
my
lord
father.
He
has
neither
the
wits
nor
the
ambition
to
plot
betrayal.вЂќ

вЂњEuron
Croweye
has
no
lack
of
cunning,
though.
IвЂ™ve
heard
men
say
terrible
things
of
that
one.вЂќ

Theon
shifted
his
seat.
вЂњMy
uncle
Euron
has
not
been
seen
in
the
islands
for
close
on
two
years.
He
may
be
dead.вЂќ
If
so,
it
might
be
for
the
best.
Lord
BalonвЂ™s
eldest
brother
had
never
given
up
the
Old
Way,
even
for
a
day.
His
Silence,
with
its
black
sails
and
dark
red
hull,
was
infamous
in
every
port
from
Ibben
to
Asshai,
it
was
said.

вЂњHe
may
be
dead,вЂќ
Esgred
agreed,
вЂњand
if
he
lives,
why,
he
has
spent
so
long
at
sea,
heвЂ™d
be
half
a
stranger
here.
The
ironborn
would
never
seat
a
stranger
in
the
Seastone
Chair.вЂќ

вЂњI
suppose
not,вЂќ
Theon
replied,
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
some
would
call
him
a
stranger
as
well.
The
thought
made
him
frown.
Ten
years
is
a
long
while,
but
I
am
back
now,
and
my
father
is
far
from
dead.
I
have
time
to
prove
myself.

He
considered
fondling
EsgredвЂ™s
breast
again,
but
she
would
probably
only
take
his
hand
away,
and
all
this
talk
of
his
uncles
had
dampened
his
ardor
somewhat.
Time
enough
for
such
play
at
the
castle,
in
the
privacy
of
his
chambers.
вЂњI
will
speak
to
Helya
when
we
reach
Pyke,
and
see
that
you
have
an
honored
place
at
the
feast,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
must
sit
on
the
dais,
at
my
fatherвЂ™s
right
hand,
but
I
will
come
down
and
join
you
when
he
leaves
the
hall.
He
seldom
lingers
long.
He
has
no
belly
for
drink
these
days.вЂќ

вЂњA
grievous
thing
when
a
great
man
grows
old.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Balon
is
but
the
father
of
a
great
man.вЂќ

вЂњA
modest
lordling.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
a
fool
humbles
himself
when
the
world
is
so
full
of
men
eager
to
do
that
job
for
him.вЂќ
He
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
nape
of
her
neck.

вЂњWhat
shall
I
wear
to
this
great
feast?вЂќ
She
reached
back
and
pushed
his
face
away.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
ask
Helya
to
garb
you.
One
of
my
lady
motherвЂ™s
gowns
might
do.
She
is
off
on
Harlaw,
and
not
expected
to
return.вЂќ

вЂњThe
cold
winds
have
worn
her
away,
I
hear.
Will
you
not
go
see
her?
Harlaw
is
only
a
dayвЂ™s
sail,
and
surely
Lady
Greyjoy
yearns
for
a
last
sight
of
her
son.вЂќ

вЂњWould
that
I
could.
I
am
kept
too
busy
here.
My
father
relies
on
me,
now
that
I
am
returned.
Come
peace,
perhapsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYour
coming
might
bring
her
peace.вЂќ

вЂњNow
you
sound
a
woman,вЂќ
Theon
complained.

вЂњI
confess,
I
amвЂ¦
and
new
with
child.вЂќ

Somehow
that
thought
excited
him.
вЂњSo
you
say,
but
your
body
shows
no
signs
of
it.
How
shall
it
be
proven?
Before
I
believe
you,
I
shall
need
to
see
your
breasts
grow
ripe,
and
taste
your
motherвЂ™s
milk.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
will
my
husband
say
to
this?
Your
fatherвЂ™s
own
sworn
man
and
servant?вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
give
him
so
many
ships
to
build,
heвЂ™ll
never
know
youвЂ™ve
left
him.вЂќ

She
laughed.
вЂњItвЂ™s
a
cruel
lordling
whoвЂ™s
seized
me.
If
I
promise
you
that
one
day
you
may
watch
my
babe
get
suck,
will
you
tell
me
more
of
your
war,
Theon
of
House
Greyjoy?
There
are
miles
and
mountains
still
ahead
of
us,
and
I
would
hear
of
this
wolf
king
you
served,
and
the
golden
lions
he
fights.вЂќ

Ever
anxious
to
please
her,
Theon
obliged.
The
rest
of
the
long
ride
passed
swiftly
as
he
filled
her
pretty
head
with
tales
of
Winterfell
and
war.
Some
of
the
things
he
said
astonished
him.
She
is
easy
to
talk
to,
gods
praise
her,
he
reflected.
I
feel
as
though
IвЂ™ve
known
her
for
years.
If
the
wenchвЂ™s
pillow
play
is
half
the
equal
of
her
wit,
IвЂ™ll
need
to
keep
herвЂ¦
He
thought
of
Sigrin
the
Shipwright,
a
thick-bodied,
thick-witted
man,
flaxen
hair
already
receding
from
a
pimpled
brow,
and
shook
his
head.
A
waste.
A
most
tragic
waste.

It
seemed
scarcely
any
time
at
all
before
the
great
curtain
wall
of
Pyke
loomed
up
before
them.

The
gates
were
open.
Theon
put
his
heels
into
Smiler
and
rode
through
at
a
brisk
trot.
The
hounds
were
barking
wildly
as
he
helped
Esgred
dismount.
Several
came
bounding
up,
tails
wagging.
They
shot
straight
past
him
and
almost
bowled
the
woman
over,
leaping
all
around
her,
yapping
and
licking.
вЂњOff,вЂќ
Theon
shouted,
aiming
an
ineffectual
kick
at
one
big
brown
bitch,
but
Esgred
was
laughing
and
wrestling
with
them.

A
stableman
came
pounding
up
after
the
dogs.
вЂњTake
the
horse,вЂќ
Theon
commanded
him,
вЂњand
get
these
damn
dogs
awayвЂ”вЂќ

The
lout
paid
him
no
mind.
His
face
broke
into
a
huge
gap-toothed
smile
and
he
said,
вЂњLady
Asha.
YouвЂ™re
back.вЂќ

вЂњLast
night,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњI
sailed
from
Great
Wyk
with
Lord
Goodbrother,
and
spent
the
night
at
the
inn.
My
little
brother
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
ride
with
him
from
Lordsport.вЂќ
She
kissed
one
of
the
dogs
on
the
nose
and
grinned
at
Theon.

All
he
could
do
was
stand
and
gape
at
her.
Asha.
No.
She
cannot
be
Asha.
He
realized
suddenly
that
there
were
two
Ashas
in
his
head.
One
was
the
little
girl
he
had
known.
The
other,
more
vaguely
imagined,
looked
something
like
her
mother.
Neither
looked
a
bit
like
thisвЂ¦
thisвЂ¦
thisвЂ¦

вЂњThe
pimples
went
when
the
breasts
came,вЂќ
she
explained
while
she
tussled
with
a
dog,
вЂњbut
I
kept
the
vultureвЂ™s
beak.вЂќ

Theon
found
his
voice.
вЂњWhy
didnвЂ™t
you
tell
me?вЂќ

Asha
let
go
of
the
hound
and
straightened.
вЂњI
wanted
to
see
who
you
were
first.
And
I
did.вЂќ
She
gave
him
a
mocking
half
bow.
вЂњAnd
now,
little
brother,
pray
excuse
me.
I
need
to
bathe
and
dress
for
the
feast.
I
wonder
if
I
still
have
that
chainmail
gown
I
like
to
wear
over
my
boiled
leather
smallclothes?вЂќ
She
gave
him
that
evil
grin,
and
crossed
the
bridge
with
that
walk
heвЂ™d
liked
so
well,
half
saunter
and
half
sway.

When
Theon
turned
away,
Wex
was
smirking
at
him.
He
gave
the
boy
a
clout
on
the
ear.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
for
enjoying
this
so
much.вЂќ
And
another,
harder.
вЂњAnd
thatвЂ™s
for
not
warning
me.
Next
time,
grow
a
tongue.вЂќ

His
own
chambers
in
the
Guest
Keep
had
never
seemed
so
chilly,
though
the
thralls
had
left
a
brazier
burning.
Theon
kicked
his
boots
off,
let
his
cloak
fall
to
the
floor,
and
poured
himself
a
cup
of
wine,
remembering
a
gawky
girl
with
knob
knees
and
pimples.
She
unlaced
my
breeches,
he
thought,
outraged,
and
she
saidвЂ¦
oh,
gods,
and
I
saidвЂ¦
He
groaned.
He
could
not
possibly
have
made
a
more
appalling
fool
of
himself.

No,
he
thought
then.
She
was
the
one
who
made
me
a
fool.
The
evil
bitch
must
have
enjoyed
every
moment
of
it.
And
the
way
she
kept
reaching
for
my
cockвЂ¦

He
took
his
cup
and
went
to
the
window
seat,
where
he
sat
drinking
and
watching
the
sea
while
the
sun
darkened
over
Pyke.
I
have
no
place
here,
he
thought,
and
Asha
is
the
reason,
may
the
Others
take
her!
The
water
below
turned
from
green
to
grey
to
black.
By
then
he
could
hear
distant
music,
and
he
knew
it
was
time
to
change
for
the
feast.

Theon
chose
plain
boots
and
plainer
clothes,
somber
shades
of
black
and
grey
to
fit
his
mood.
No
ornament;
he
had
nothing
bought
with
iron.
I
might
have
taken
something
off
that
wildling
I
killed
to
save
Bran
Stark,
but
he
had
nothing
worth
the
taking.
ThatвЂ™s
my
cursed
luck,
I
kill
the
poor.

The
long
smoky
hall
was
crowded
with
his
fatherвЂ™s
lords
and
captains
when
Theon
entered,
near
four
hundred
of
them.
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
had
not
yet
returned
from
Old
Wyk
with
the
Stonehouses
and
Drumms,
but
all
the
rest
were
thereвЂ”Harlaws
from
Harlaw,
Blacktydes
from
Blacktyde,
Sparrs,
Merlyns,
and
Goodbrothers
from
Great
Wyk,
Saltcliffes
and
Sunderlies
from
Saltcliffe,
and
Botleys
and
Wynches
from
the
other
side
of
Pyke.
The
thralls
were
pouring
ale,
and
there
was
music,
fiddles
and
skins
and
drums.
Three
burly
men
were
doing
the
finger
dance,
spinning
short-hafted
axes
at
each
other.
The
trick
was
to
catch
the
axe
or
leap
over
it
without
missing
a
step.
It
was
called
the
finger
dance
because
it
usually
ended
when
one
of
the
dancers
lost
oneвЂ¦
or
two,
or
five.

Neither
the
dancers
nor
the
drinkers
took
much
note
of
Theon
Greyjoy
as
he
strode
to
the
dais.
Lord
Balon
occupied
the
Seastone
Chair,
carved
in
the
shape
of
a
great
kraken
from
an
immense
block
of
oily
black
stone.
Legend
said
that
the
First
Men
had
found
it
standing
on
the
shore
of
Old
Wyk
when
they
came
to
the
Iron
Islands.
To
the
left
of
the
high
seat
were
TheonвЂ™s
uncles.
Asha
was
ensconced
at
his
right
hand,
in
the
place
of
honor.
вЂњYou
come
late,
Theon,вЂќ
Lord
Balon
observed.

вЂњI
ask
your
pardon.вЂќ
Theon
took
the
empty
seat
beside
Asha.
Leaning
close,
he
hissed
in
her
ear,
вЂњYouвЂ™re
in
my
place.вЂќ

She
turned
to
him
with
innocent
eyes.
вЂњBrother,
surely
you
are
mistaken.
Your
place
is
at
Winterfell.вЂќ
Her
smile
cut.
вЂњAnd
where
are
all
your
pretty
clothes?
I
heard
you
fancied
silk
and
velvet
against
your
skin.вЂќ
She
was
in
soft
green
wool
herself,
simply
cut,
the
fabric
clinging
to
the
slender
lines
of
her
body.

вЂњYour
hauberk
must
have
rusted
away,
sister,вЂќ
he
threw
back.
вЂњA
great
pity.
IвЂ™d
like
to
see
you
all
in
iron.вЂќ

Asha
only
laughed.
вЂњYou
may
yet,
little
brotherвЂ¦
if
you
think
your
Sea
Bitch
can
keep
up
with
my
Black
Wind.вЂќ
One
of
their
fatherвЂ™s
thralls
came
near,
bearing
a
flagon
of
wine.
вЂњAre
you
drinking
ale
or
wine
tonight,
Theon?вЂќ
She
leaned
over
close.
вЂњOr
is
it
still
a
taste
of
my
motherвЂ™s
milk
you
thirst
for?вЂќ

He
flushed.
вЂњWine,вЂќ
he
told
the
thrall.
Asha
turned
away
and
banged
on
the
table,
shouting
for
ale.

Theon
hacked
a
loaf
of
bread
in
half,
hollowed
out
a
trencher,
and
summoned
a
cook
to
fill
it
with
fish
stew.
The
smell
of
the
thick
cream
made
him
a
little
ill,
but
he
forced
himself
to
eat
some.
HeвЂ™d
drunk
enough
wine
to
float
him
through
two
meals.
If
I
retch,
it
will
be
on
her.
вЂњDoes
Father
know
that
youвЂ™ve
married
his
shipwright?вЂќ
he
asked
his
sister.

вЂњNo
more
than
Sigrin
does.вЂќ
She
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњEsgred
was
the
first
ship
he
built.
He
named
her
after
his
mother.
I
would
be
hard-pressed
to
say
which
he
loves
best.вЂќ

вЂњEvery
word
you
spoke
to
me
was
a
lie.вЂќ

вЂњNot
every
word.
Remember
when
I
told
you
I
like
to
be
on
top?вЂќ
Asha
grinned.

That
only
made
him
angrier.
вЂњAll
that
about
being
a
woman
wed,
and
new
with
childвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOh,
that
part
was
true
enough.вЂќ
Asha
leapt
to
her
feet.
вЂњRolfe,
here,вЂќ
she
shouted
down
at
one
of
the
finger
dancers,
holding
up
a
hand.
He
saw
her,
spun,
and
suddenly
an
axe
came
flying
from
his
hand,
the
blade
gleaming
as
it
tumbled
end
over
end
through
the
torchlight.
Theon
had
time
for
a
choked
gasp
before
Asha
snatched
the
axe
from
the
air
and
slammed
it
down
into
the
table,
splitting
his
trencher
in
two
and
splattering
his
mantle
with
drippings.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
my
lord
husband.вЂќ
His
sister
reached
down
inside
her
gown
and
drew
a
dirk
from
between
her
breasts.
вЂњAnd
hereвЂ™s
my
sweet
suckling
babe.вЂќ

He
could
not
imagine
how
he
looked
at
that
moment,
but
suddenly
Theon
Greyjoy
realized
that
the
Great
Hall
was
ringing
with
laughter,
all
of
it
at
him.
Even
his
father
was
smiling,
gods
be
damned,
and
his
uncle
Victarion
chuckled
aloud.
The
best
response
he
could
summon
was
a
queasy
grin.
We
shall
see
who
is
laughing
when
all
this
is
done,
bitch.

Asha
wrenched
the
axe
out
of
the
table
and
flung
it
back
down
at
the
dancers,
to
whistles
and
loud
cheers.
вЂњYouвЂ™d
do
well
to
heed
what
I
told
you
about
choosing
a
crew.вЂќ
A
thrall
offered
them
a
platter,
and
she
stabbed
a
salted
fish
and
ate
it
off
the
end
of
her
dirk.
вЂњIf
you
had
troubled
to
learn
the
first
thing
of
Sigrin,
I
could
never
have
fooled
you.
Ten
years
a
wolf,
and
you
land
here
and
think
to
prince
about
the
islands,
but
you
know
nothing
and
no
one.
Why
should
men
fight
and
die
for
you?
вЂњ

вЂњI
am
their
lawful
prince,вЂќ
Theon
said
stiffly.

вЂњBy
the
laws
of
the
green
lands,
you
might
be.
But
we
make
our
own
laws
here,
or
have
you
forgotten?вЂќ

Scowling,
Theon
turned
to
contemplate
the
leaking
trencher
before
him.
He
would
have
stew
in
his
lap
before
long.
He
shouted
for
a
thrall
to
clean
it
up.
Half
my
life
I
have
waited
to
come
home,
and
for
what?
Mockery
and
disregard?
This
was
not
the
Pyke
he
remembered.
Or
did
he
remember?
He
had
been
so
young
when
they
took
him
away
to
hold
hostage.

The
feast
was
a
meager
enough
thing,
a
succession
of
fish
stews,
black
bread,
and
spiceless
goat.
The
tastiest
thing
Theon
found
to
eat
was
an
onion
pie.
Ale
and
wine
continued
to
flow
well
after
the
last
of
the
courses
had
been
cleared
away.

Lord
Balon
Greyjoy
rose
from
the
Seastone
Chair.
вЂњHave
done
with
your
drink
and
come
to
my
solar,вЂќ
he
commanded
his
companions
on
the
dais.
вЂњWe
have
plans
to
lay.вЂќ
He
left
them
with
no
other
word,
flanked
by
two
of
his
guards.
His
brothers
followed
in
short
order.
Theon
rose
to
go
after
them.

вЂњMy
little
brother
is
in
a
rush
to
be
off.вЂќ
Asha
raised
her
drinking
horn
and
beckoned
for
more
ale.

вЂњOur
lord
father
is
waiting.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
has,
for
many
a
year.
It
will
do
him
no
harm
to
wait
a
little
longerвЂ¦
but
if
you
fear
his
wrath,
scurry
after
him
by
all
means.
You
ought
to
have
no
trouble
catching
our
uncles.вЂќ
She
smiled.
вЂњOne
is
drunk
on
seawater,
after
all,
and
the
other
is
a
great
grey
bullock
so
dim
heвЂ™ll
probably
get
lost.вЂќ

Theon
sat
back
down,
annoyed.
вЂњI
run
after
no
man.вЂќ

вЂњNo
man,
but
every
woman?вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
not
me
who
grabbed
your
cock.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
have
one,
remember?
You
grabbed
every
other
bit
of
me
quick
enough.вЂќ

He
could
feel
the
flush
creeping
up
his
cheeks.
вЂњIвЂ™m
a
man
with
a
manвЂ™s
hungers.
What
sort
of
unnatural
creature
are
you?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
a
shy
maid.вЂќ
AshaвЂ™s
hand
darted
out
under
the
table
to
give
his
cock
a
squeeze.
Theon
nearly
jumped
from
his
chair.
вЂњWhat,
donвЂ™t
you
want
me
to
steer
you
into
port,
brother?вЂќ

вЂњMarriage
is
not
for
you,вЂќ
Theon
decided.
вЂњWhen
I
rule,
I
believe
I
will
pack
you
off
to
the
silent
sisters.вЂќ
He
lurched
to
his
feet
and
strode
off
unsteadily
to
find
his
father.

Rain
was
falling
by
the
time
he
reached
the
swaying
bridge
out
to
the
Sea
Tower.
His
stomach
was
crashing
and
churning
like
the
waves
below,
and
wine
had
unsteadied
his
feet.
Theon
gritted
his
teeth
and
gripped
the
rope
tightly
as
he
made
his
way
across,
pretending
that
it
was
AshaвЂ™s
neck
he
was
clutching.

The
solar
was
as
damp
and
drafty
as
ever.
Buried
under
his
sealskin
robes,
his
father
sat
before
the
brazier
with
his
brothers
on
either
side
of
him.
Victarion
was
talking
of
tides
and
winds
when
Theon
entered,
but
Lord
Balon
waved
him
silent.
вЂњI
have
made
my
plans.
It
is
time
you
heard
them.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
some
suggestionsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhen
I
require
your
counsel
I
shall
ask
for
it,вЂќ
his
father
said.
вЂњWe
have
had
a
bird
from
Old
Wyk.
Dagmer
is
bringing
the
Drumms
and
Stonehouses.
If
the
god
grants
us
good
winds,
we
will
sail
when
they
arriveвЂ¦
or
you
will.
I
mean
for
you
to
strike
the
first
blow,
Theon.
You
shall
take
eight
longships
northвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњEight?вЂќ
His
face
reddened.
вЂњWhat
can
I
hope
to
accomplish
with
only
eight
longships?вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
to
harry
the
Stony
Shore,
raiding
the
fishing
villages
and
sinking
any
ships
you
chance
to
meet.
It
may
be
that
you
will
draw
some
of
the
northern
lords
out
from
behind
their
stone
walls.
Aeron
will
accompany
you,
and
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.вЂќ

вЂњMay
the
Drowned
God
bless
our
swords,вЂќ
the
priest
said.

Theon
felt
as
if
heвЂ™d
been
slapped.
He
was
being
sent
to
do
reaverвЂ™s
work,
burning
fishermen
out
of
their
hovels
and
raping
their
ugly
daughters,
and
yet
it
seemed
Lord
Balon
did
not
trust
him
sufficiently
to
do
even
that
much.
Bad
enough
to
have
to
suffer
the
DamphairвЂ™s
scowls
and
chidings.
With
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
along
as
well,
his
command
would
be
purely
nominal.

вЂњAsha
my
daughter,вЂќ
Lord
Balon
went
on,
and
Theon
turned
to
see
that
his
sister
had
slipped
in
silently,
вЂњyou
shall
take
thirty
longships
of
picked
men
round
Sea
Dragon
Point.
Land
upon
the
tidal
flats
north
of
Deepwood
Motte.
March
quickly,
and
the
castle
may
fall
before
they
even
know
you
are
upon
them.вЂќ

Asha
smiled
like
a
cat
in
cream.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
always
wanted
a
castle,вЂќ
she
said
sweetly.

вЂњThen
take
one.вЂќ

Theon
had
to
bite
his
tongue.
Deepwood
Motte
was
the
stronghold
of
the
Glovers.
With
both
Robett
and
Galbart
warring
in
the
south,
it
would
be
lightly
held,
and
once
the
castle
fell
the
ironmen
would
have
a
secure
base
in
the
heart
of
the
north.
I
should
be
the
one
sent
to
take
Deepwood.
He
knew
Deepwood
Motte,
he
had
visited
the
Glovers
several
times
with
Eddard
Stark.

вЂњVictarion,вЂќ
Lord
Balon
said
to
his
brother,
вЂњthe
main
thrust
shall
fall
to
you.
When
my
sons
have
struck
their
blows,
Winterfell
must
respond.
You
should
meet
small
opposition
as
you
sail
up
Saltspear
and
the
Fever
River.
At
the
headwaters,
you
will
be
less
than
twenty
miles
from
Moat
Cailin.
The
Neck
is
the
key
to
the
kingdom.
Already
we
command
the
western
seas.
Once
we
hold
Moat
Cailin,
the
pup
will
not
be
able
to
win
back
to
the
northвЂ¦
and
if
he
is
fool
enough
to
try,
his
enemies
will
seal
the
south
end
of
the
causeway
behind
him,
and
Robb
the
boy
will
find
himself
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
bottle.вЂќ

Theon
could
keep
silent
no
longer.
вЂњA
bold
plan,
Father,
but
the
lords
in
their
castlesвЂ”вЂќ

Lord
Balon
rode
over
him.
вЂњThe
lords
are
gone
south
with
the
pup.
Those
who
remained
behind
are
the
cravens,
old
men,
and
green
boys.
They
will
yield
or
fall,
one
by
one.
Winterfell
may
defy
us
for
a
year,
but
what
of
it?
The
rest
shall
be
ours,
forest
and
field
and
hall,
and
we
shall
make
the
folk
our
thralls
and
salt
wives.вЂќ

Aeron
Damphair
raised
his
arms.
вЂњAnd
the
waters
of
wrath
will
rise
high,
and
the
Drowned
God
will
spread
his
dominion
across
the
green
lands!вЂќ

вЂњWhat
is
dead
can
never
die,вЂќ
Victarion
intoned.
Lord
Balon
and
Asha
echoed
his
words,
and
Theon
had
no
choice
but
to
mumble
along
with
them.
And
then
it
was
done.

Outside
the
rain
was
falling
harder
than
ever.
The
rope
bridge
twisted
and
writhed
under
his
feet.
Theon
Greyjoy
stopped
in
the
center
of
the
span
and
contemplated
the
rocks
below.
The
sound
of
the
waves
was
a
crashing
roar,
and
he
could
taste
the
salt
spray
on
his
lips.
A
sudden
gust
of
wind
made
him
lose
his
footing,
and
he
stumbled
to
his
knees.

Asha
helped
him
rise.
вЂњYou
canвЂ™t
hold
your
wine
either,
brother.вЂќ

Theon
leaned
on
her
shoulder
and
let
her
guide
him
across
the
rainslick
boards.
вЂњI
liked
you
better
when
you
were
Esgred,вЂќ
he
told
her
accusingly.

She
laughed.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
fair.
I
liked
you
better
when
you
were
nine.вЂќ





TYRION

Through
the
door
came
the
soft
sound
of
the
high
harp,
mingled
with
a
trilling
of
pipes.
The
singerвЂ™s
voice
was
muffled
by
the
thick
walls,
yet
Tyrion
knew
the
verse.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
he
remembered,
with
sunlight
in
her
hairвЂ¦

Ser
Meryn
Trant
guarded
the
queenвЂ™s
door
this
night.
His
muttered
вЂњMy
lordвЂќ
struck
Tyrion
as
a
tad
grudging,
but
he
opened
the
door
nonetheless.
The
song
broke
off
abruptly
as
he
strode
into
his
sisterвЂ™s
bedchamber.

Cersei
was
reclining
on
a
pile
of
cushions.
Her
feet
were
bare,
her
golden
hair
artfully
tousled,
her
robe
a
green-and-gold
samite
that
caught
the
light
of
the
candles
and
shimmered
as
she
looked
up.
вЂњSweet
sister,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
вЂњhow
beautiful
you
look
tonight.вЂќ
He
turned
to
the
singer.
вЂњAnd
you
as
well,
cousin.
I
had
no
notion
you
had
such
a
lovely
voice.вЂќ

The
compliment
made
Ser
Lancel
sulky;
perhaps
he
thought
he
was
being
mocked.
It
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
the
lad
had
grown
three
inches
since
being
knighted.
Lancel
had
thick
sandy
hair,
green
Lannister
eyes,
and
a
line
of
soft
blond
fuzz
on
his
upper
lip.
At
sixteen,
he
was
cursed
with
all
the
certainty
of
youth,
unleavened
by
any
trace
of
humor
or
self-doubt,
and
wed
to
the
arrogance
that
came
so
naturally
to
those
born
blond
and
strong
and
handsome.
His
recent
elevation
had
only
made
him
worse.
вЂњDid
Her
Grace
send
for
you?вЂќ
the
boy
demanded.

вЂњNot
that
I
recall,вЂќ
Tyrion
admitted.
вЂњIt
grieves
me
to
disturb
your
revels,
Lancel,
but
as
it
happens,
I
have
matters
of
import
to
discuss
with
my
sister.вЂќ

Cersei
regarded
him
suspiciously.
вЂњIf
you
are
here
about
those
begging
brothers,
Tyrion,
spare
me
your
reproaches.
I
wonвЂ™t
have
them
spreading
their
filthy
treasons
in
the
streets.
They
can
preach
to
each
other
in
the
dungeons.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
count
themselves
lucky
that
they
have
such
a
gentle
queen,вЂќ
added
Lancel.
вЂњI
would
have
had
their
tongues
out.вЂќ

вЂњOne
even
dared
to
say
that
the
gods
were
punishing
us
because
Jaime
murdered
the
rightful
king,вЂќ
Cersei
declared.
вЂњIt
will
not
be
borne,
Tyrion.
I
gave
you
ample
opportunity
to
deal
with
these
lice,
but
you
and
your
Ser
Jacelyn
did
nothing,
so
I
commanded
Vylarr
to
attend
to
the
matter.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
so
he
did.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
been
annoyed
when
the
red
cloaks
had
dragged
a
half
dozen
of
the
scabrous
prophets
down
to
the
dungeons
without
consulting
him,
but
they
were
not
important
enough
to
battle
over.
вЂњNo
doubt
we
will
all
be
better
off
for
a
little
quiet
in
the
streets.
That
is
not
why
I
came.
I
have
tidings
I
know
you
will
be
anxious
to
hear,
sweet
sister,
but
they
are
best
spoken
of
privily.вЂќ

вЂњVery
well.вЂќ
The
harpist
and
the
piper
bowed
and
hurried
out,
while
Cersei
kissed
her
cousin
chastely
on
the
cheek.
вЂњLeave
us,
Lancel.
My
brotherвЂ™s
harmless
when
heвЂ™s
alone.
If
heвЂ™d
brought
his
pets,
weвЂ™d
smell
them.вЂќ

The
young
knight
gave
his
cousin
a
baleful
glance
and
pulled
the
door
shut
forcefully
behind
him.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
you
know
I
make
Shagga
bathe
once
a
fortnight,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
when
he
was
gone.

вЂњYouвЂ™re
very
pleased
with
yourself,
arenвЂ™t
you?
Why?вЂќ

вЂњWhy
not?вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
Every
day,
every
night,
hammers
rang
along
the
Street
of
Steel,
and
the
great
chain
grew
longer.
He
hopped
up
onto
the
great
canopied
bed.
вЂњIs
this
the
bed
where
Robert
died?
IвЂ™m
surprised
you
kept
it.вЂќ

вЂњIt
gives
me
sweet
dreams,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњNow
spit
out
your
business
and
waddle
away,
Imp.вЂќ

Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњLord
Stannis
has
sailed
from
Dragonstone.вЂќ

Cersei
bolted
to
her
feet.
вЂњAnd
yet
you
sit
there
grinning
like
a
harvest-day
pumpkin?
Has
Bywater
called
out
the
City
Watch?
We
must
send
a
bird
to
Harrenhal
at
once.вЂќ
He
was
laughing
by
then.
She
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him.
вЂњStop
it.
Are
you
mad,
or
drunk?
Stop
it!вЂќ

It
was
all
he
could
do
to
get
out
the
words.
вЂњI
canвЂ™t,вЂќ
he
gasped.
вЂњItвЂ™s
tooвЂ¦
gods,
too
funnyвЂ¦
StannisвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWhat?вЂќ

вЂњHe
hasnвЂ™t
sailed
against
us,вЂќ
Tyrion
managed.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
laid
siege
to
StormвЂ™s
End.
Renly
is
riding
to
meet
him.вЂќ

His
sisterвЂ™s
nails
dug
painfully
into
his
arms.
For
a
moment
she
stared
incredulous,
as
if
he
had
begun
to
gibber
in
an
unknown
tongue.
вЂњStannis
and
Renly
are
fighting
each
other?вЂќ
When
he
nodded,
Cersei
began
to
chuckle.
вЂњGods
be
good,вЂќ
she
gasped,
вЂњIвЂ™m
starting
to
believe
that
Robert
was
the
clever
one.вЂќ

Tyrion
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
They
laughed
together.
Cersei
pulled
him
off
the
bed
and
whirled
him
around
and
even
hugged
him,
for
a
moment
as
giddy
as
a
girl.
By
the
time
she
let
go
of
him,
Tyrion
was
breathless
and
dizzy.
He
staggered
to
her
sideboard
and
put
out
a
hand
to
steady
himself.

вЂњDo
you
think
it
will
truly
come
to
battle
between
them?
If
they
should
come
to
some
accordвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњThey
are
too
different
and
yet
too
much
alike,
and
neither
could
ever
stomach
the
other.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Stannis
has
always
felt
he
was
cheated
of
StormвЂ™s
End,вЂќ
Cersei
said
thoughtfully.
вЂњThe
ancestral
seat
of
House
Baratheon,
his
by
rightsвЂ¦
if
you
knew
how
many
times
he
came
to
Robert
singing
that
same
dull
song
in
that
gloomy
aggrieved
tone
he
has.
When
Robert
gave
the
place
to
Renly,
Stannis
clenched
his
jaw
so
tight
I
thought
his
teeth
would
shatter.вЂќ

вЂњHe
took
it
as
a
slight.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
meant
as
a
slight,вЂќ
Cersei
said.

вЂњShall
we
raise
a
cup
to
brotherly
love?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
she
answered,
breathless.
вЂњOh,
gods,
yes.вЂќ

His
back
was
to
her
as
he
filled
two
cups
with
sweet
Arbor
red.
It
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
sprinkle
a
pinch
of
fine
powder
into
hers.
вЂњTo
Stannis!вЂќ
he
said
as
he
handed
her
the
wine.
Harmless
when
IвЂ™m
alone,
am
I?

вЂњTo
Renly!вЂќ
she
replied,
laughing.
вЂњMay
they
battle
long
and
hard,
and
the
Others
take
them
both!вЂќ

Is
this
the
Cersei
that
Jaime
sees?
When
she
smiled,
you
saw
how
beautiful
she
was,
truly.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
with
sunlight
in
her
hair.
He
almost
felt
sorry
for
poisoning
her.

It
was
the
next
morning
as
he
broke
his
fast
that
her
messenger
arrived.
The
queen
was
indisposed
and
would
not
be
able
to
leave
her
chambers.
Not
able
to
leave
her
privy,
more
like.
Tyrion
made
the
proper
sympathetic
noises
and
sent
word
to
Cersei
to
rest
easy,
he
would
treat
with
Ser
Cleos
as
theyвЂ™d
planned.

The
Iron
Throne
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
was
a
tangle
of
nasty
barbs
and
jagged
metal
teeth
waiting
for
any
fool
who
tried
to
sit
too
comfortably,
and
the
steps
made
his
stunted
legs
cramp
as
he
climbed
up
to
it,
all
too
aware
of
what
an
absurd
spectacle
he
must
be.
Yet
there
was
one
thing
to
be
said
for
it.
It
was
high.

Lannister
guardsmen
stood
silent
in
their
crimson
cloaks
and
lioncrested
halfhelms.
Ser
JacelynвЂ™s
gold
cloaks
faced
them
across
the
hall.
The
steps
to
the
throne
were
flanked
by
Bronn
and
Ser
Preston
of
the
Kingsguard.
Courtiers
filled
the
gallery
while
supplicants
clustered
near
the
towering
oak-and-bronze
doors.
Sansa
Stark
looked
especially
lovely
this
morning,
though
her
face
was
as
pale
as
milk.
Lord
Gyles
stood
coughing,
while
poor
cousin
Tyrek
wore
his
bridegroomвЂ™s
mantle
of
miniver
and
velvet.
Since
his
marriage
to
little
Lady
Ermesande
three
days
past,
the
other
squires
had
taken
to
calling
him
вЂњWet
NurseвЂќ
and
asking
him
what
sort
of
swaddling
clothes
his
bride
wore
on
their
wedding
night.

Tyrion
looked
down
on
them
all,
and
found
he
liked
it.
вЂњCall
forth
Ser
Cleos
Frey.вЂќ
His
voice
rang
off
the
stone
walls
and
down
the
length
of
the
hall.
He
liked
that
too.
A
pity
Shae
could
not
be
here
to
see
this,
he
reflected.
SheвЂ™d
asked
to
come,
but
it
was
impossible.

Ser
Cleos
made
the
long
walk
between
the
gold
cloaks
and
the
crimson,
looking
neither
right
nor
left.
As
he
knelt,
Tyrion
observed
that
his
cousin
was
losing
his
hair.

вЂњSer
Cleos,вЂќ
Littlefinger
said
from
the
council
table,
вЂњyou
have
our
thanks
for
bringing
us
this
peace
offer
from
Lord
Stark.вЂќ

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњThe
Queen
Regent,
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand,
and
the
small
council
have
considered
the
terms
offered
by
this
self-styled
King
in
the
North.
Sad
to
say,
they
will
not
do,
and
you
must
tell
these
northmen
so,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњHere
are
our
terms,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњRobb
Stark
must
lay
down
his
sword,
swear
fealty,
and
return
to
Winterfell.
He
must
free
my
brother
unharmed,
and
place
his
host
under
JaimeвЂ™s
command,
to
march
against
the
rebels
Renly
and
Stannis
Baratheon.
Each
of
StarkвЂ™s
bannermen
must
send
us
a
son
as
hostage.
A
daughter
will
suffice
where
there
is
no
son.
They
shall
be
treated
gently
and
given
high
places
here
at
court,
so
long
as
their
fathers
commit
no
new
treasons.вЂќ

Cleos
Frey
looked
ill.
вЂњMy
lord
Hand,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњLord
Stark
will
never
consent
to
these
terms.вЂќ

We
never
expected
he
would,
Cleos.
вЂњTell
him
that
we
have
raised
another
great
host
at
Casterly
Rock,
that
soon
it
will
march
on
him
from
the
west
while
my
lord
father
advances
from
the
east.
Tell
him
that
he
stands
alone,
without
hope
of
allies.
Stannis
and
Renly
Baratheon
war
against
each
other,
and
the
Prince
of
Dorne
has
consented
to
wed
his
son
Trystane
to
the
Princess
Myrcella.вЂќ
Murmurs
of
delight
and
consternation
alike
arose
from
the
gallery
and
the
back
of
the
hall.

вЂњAs
to
this
of
my
cousins,вЂќ
Tyrion
went
on,
вЂњwe
offer
Harrion
Karstark
and
Ser
Wylis
Manderly
for
Willem
Lannister,
and
Lord
Cerwyn
and
Ser
Donnel
Locke
for
your
brother
Tion.
Tell
Stark
that
two
Lannisters
are
worth
four
northmen
in
any
season.вЂќ
He
waited
for
the
laughter
to
die.
вЂњHis
fatherвЂ™s
bones
he
shall
have,
as
a
gesture
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
good
faith.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Stark
asked
for
his
sisters
and
his
fatherвЂ™s
sword
as
well,вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
reminded
him.

Ser
Ilyn
Payne
stood
mute,
the
hilt
of
Eddard
StarkвЂ™s
greatsword
rising
over
one
shoulder.
вЂњIce,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
have
that
when
he
makes
his
peace
with
us,
not
before.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.
And
his
sisters?вЂќ

Tyrion
glanced
toward
Sansa,
and
felt
a
stab
of
pity
as
he
said,
вЂњUntil
such
time
as
he
frees
my
brother
Jaime,
unharmed,
they
shall
remain
here
as
hostages.
How
well
they
are
treated
depends
on
him.вЂќ
And
if
the
gods
are
good,
Bywater
will
find
Arya
alive,
before
Robb
learns
sheвЂ™s
gone
missing.

вЂњI
shall
bring
him
your
message,
my
lord.вЂќ

Tyrion
plucked
at
one
of
the
twisted
blades
that
sprang
from
the
arm
of
the
throne.
And
now
the
thrust.
вЂњVylarr,вЂќ
he
called.

вЂњMy
lord.вЂќ

вЂњThe
men
Stark
sent
are
sufficient
to
protect
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
bones,
but
a
Lannister
should
have
a
Lannister
escort,вЂќ
Tyrion
declared.
вЂњSer
Cleos
is
the
queenвЂ™s
cousin,
and
mine.
We
shall
sleep
more
easily
if
you
would
see
him
safely
back
to
Riverrun.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
command.
How
many
men
should
I
take?вЂќ

вЂњWhy,
all
of
them.вЂќ

Vylarr
stood
like
a
man
made
of
stone.
It
was
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
who
rose,
gasping,
вЂњMy
lord
Hand,
that
cannotвЂ¦
your
father,
Lord
Tywin
himself,
he
sent
these
good
men
to
our
city
to
protect
Queen
Cersei
and
her
childrenвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
Kingsguard
and
the
City
Watch
protect
them
well
enough.
The
gods
speed
you
on
your
way,
Vylarr.вЂќ

At
the
council
table
Varys
smiled
knowingly,
Littlefinger
sat
feigning
boredom,
and
Pycelle
gaped
like
a
fish,
pale
and
confused.
A
herald
stepped
forward.
вЂњIf
any
man
has
other
matters
to
set
before
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand,
let
him
speak
now
or
go
forth
and
hold
his
silence.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
be
heard.вЂќ
A
slender
man
all
in
black
pushed
his
way
between
the
Redwyne
twins.

вЂњSer
Alliser!вЂќ
Tyrion
exclaimed.
вЂњWhy,
I
had
no
notion
that
youвЂ™d
come
to
court.
You
should
have
sent
me
word.вЂќ

вЂњI
have,
as
well
you
know.вЂќ
Thorne
was
as
prickly
as
his
name,
a
spare,
sharp-featured
man
of
fifty,
hard-eyed
and
hard-handed,
his
black
hair
streaked
with
grey.
вЂњI
have
been
shunned,
ignored,
and
left
to
wait
like
some
baseborn
servant.вЂќ

вЂњTruly?
Bronn,
this
was
not
well
done.
Ser
Alliser
and
I
are
old
friends.
We
walked
the
Wall
together.вЂќ

вЂњSweet
Ser
Alliser,вЂќ
murmured
Varys,
вЂњyou
must
not
think
too
harshly
of
us.
So
many
seek
our
JoffreyвЂ™s
grace,
in
these
troubled
and
tumultuous
times.вЂќ

вЂњMore
troubled
than
you
know,
eunuch.вЂќ

вЂњTo
his
face
we
call
him
Lord
Eunuch,вЂќ
quipped
Littlefinger.

вЂњHow
may
we
be
of
help
to
you,
good
brother?вЂќ
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
asked
in
soothing
tones.

вЂњThe
Lord
Commander
sent
me
to
His
Grace
the
king,вЂќ
Thorne
answered.
вЂњThe
matter
is
too
grave
to
be
left
to
servants.вЂќ

вЂњThe
king
is
playing
with
his
new
crossbow,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
Ridding
himself
of
Joffrey
had
required
only
an
ungainly
Myrish
crossbow
that
threw
three
quarrels
at
a
time,
and
nothing
would
do
but
that
he
try
it
at
once.
вЂњYou
can
speak
to
servants
or
hold
your
silence.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will,вЂќ
Ser
Alliser
said,
displeasure
in
every
word.
вЂњI
am
sent
to
tell
you
that
we
found
two
rangers,
long
missing.
They
were
dead,
yet
when
we
brought
the
corpses
back
to
the
Wall
they
rose
again
in
the
night.
One
slew
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
while
the
second
tried
to
murder
the
Lord
Commander.вЂќ

Distantly,
Tyrion
heard
someone
snigger.
Does
he
mean
to
mock
me
with
this
folly?
He
shifted
uneasily
and
glanced
down
at
Varys,
Littlefinger,
and
Pycelle,
wondering
if
one
of
them
had
a
role
in
this.
A
dwarf
enjoyed
at
best
a
tenuous
hold
on
dignity.
Once
the
court
and
kingdom
started
to
laugh
at
him,
he
was
doomed.
And
yetвЂ¦
and
yetвЂ¦

Tyrion
remembered
a
cold
night
under
the
stars
when
heвЂ™d
stood
beside
the
boy
Jon
Snow
and
a
great
white
wolf
atop
the
Wall
at
the
end
of
the
world,
gazing
out
at
the
trackless
dark
beyond.
He
had
feltвЂ”what?вЂ”something,
to
be
sure,
a
dread
that
had
cut
like
that
frigid
northern
wind.
A
wolf
had
howled
off
in
the
night,
and
the
sound
had
sent
a
shiver
through
him.

DonвЂ™t
be
a
fool,
he
told
himself.
A
wolf,
a
wind,
a
dark
forest,
it
meant
nothing.
And
yetвЂ¦
He
had
come
to
have
a
liking
for
old
Jeor
Mormont
during
his
time
at
Castle
Black.
вЂњI
trust
that
the
Old
Bear
survived
this
attack?вЂќ

вЂњHe
did.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
that
your
brothers
killed
these,
ah,
dead
men?вЂќ

вЂњWe
did.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
certain
that
they
are
dead
this
time?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked
mildly.
When
Bronn
choked
on
a
snort
of
laughter,
he
knew
how
he
must
proceed.
вЂњTruly
truly
dead?вЂќ

вЂњThey
were
dead
the
first
time,вЂќ
Ser
Alliser
snapped.
вЂњPale
and
cold,
with
black
hands
and
feet.
I
brought
JaredвЂ™s
hand,
torn
from
his
corpse
by
the
bastardвЂ™s
wolf.вЂќ

Littlefinger
stirred.
вЂњAnd
where
is
this
charming
token?вЂќ

Ser
Alliser
frowned
uncomfortably.
вЂњItвЂ¦
rotted
to
pieces
while
I
waited,
unheard.
ThereвЂ™s
naught
left
to
show
but
bones.вЂќ

Titters
echoed
through
the
hall.
вЂњLord
Baelish,вЂќ
Tyrion
called
down
to
Littlefinger,
вЂњbuy
our
brave
Ser
Alliser
a
hundred
spades
to
take
back
to
the
Wall
with
him.вЂќ

вЂњSpades?вЂќ
Ser
Alliser
narrowed
his
eyes
suspiciously.

вЂњIf
you
bury
your
dead,
they
wonвЂ™t
come
walking,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
him,
and
the
court
laughed
openly.
вЂњSpades
will
end
your
troubles,
with
some
strong
backs
to
wield
them.
Ser
Jacelyn,
see
that
the
good
brother
has
his
pick
of
the
city
dungeons.вЂќ

Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
said,
вЂњAs
you
will,
my
lord,
but
the
cells
are
near
empty.
Yoren
took
all
the
likely
men.вЂќ

вЂњArrest
some
more,
then,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
him.
вЂњOr
spread
the
word
that
thereвЂ™s
bread
and
turnips
on
the
Wall,
and
theyвЂ™ll
go
of
their
own
accord.вЂќ
The
city
had
too
many
mouths
to
feed,
and
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
a
perpetual
need
of
men.
At
TyrionвЂ™s
signal,
the
herald
cried
an
end,
and
the
hall
began
to
empty.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
not
so
easily
dismissed.
He
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
iron
Throne
when
Tyrion
descended.
вЂњDo
you
think
I
sailed
all
the
way
from
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea
to
be
mocked
by
the
likes
of
you?вЂќ
he
fumed,
blocking
the
way.
вЂњThis
is
no
jape.
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes.
I
tell
you,
the
dead
walk.вЂќ

вЂњYou
should
try
to
kill
them
more
thoroughly.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
past.
Ser
Alliser
made
to
grab
his
sleeve,
but
Preston
Greenfield
thrust
him
back.
вЂњNo
closer,
ser.вЂќ

Thorne
knew
better
than
to
challenge
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
вЂњYou
are
a
fool,
Imp,вЂќ
he
shouted
at
TyrionвЂ™s
back.

The
dwarf
turned
to
face
him.
вЂњMe?
Truly?
Then
why
were
they
laughing
at
you,
I
wonder?вЂќ
He
smiled
wanly.
вЂњYou
came
for
men,
did
you
not?вЂќ

вЂњThe
cold
winds
are
rising.
The
Wall
must
be
held.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
to
hold
it
you
need
men,
which
IвЂ™ve
given
youвЂ¦
as
you
might
have
noted,
if
your
ears
heard
anything
but
insults.
Take
them,
thank
me,
and
begone
before
IвЂ™m
forced
to
take
a
crab
fork
to
you
again.
Give
my
warm
regards
to
Lord
MormontвЂ¦
and
to
Jon
Snow
as
well.вЂќ
Bronn
seized
Ser
Alliser
by
the
elbow
and
marched
him
forcefully
from
the
hall.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
already
scuttled
off,
but
Varys
and
Littlefinger
had
watched
it
all,
start
to
finish.
вЂњI
grow
ever
more
admiring
of
you,
my
lord,вЂќ
confessed
the
eunuch.
вЂњYou
appease
the
Stark
boy
with
his
fatherвЂ™s
bones
and
strip
your
sister
of
her
protectors
in
one
swift
stroke.
You
give
that
black
brother
the
men
he
seeks,
rid
the
city
of
some
hungry
mouths,
yet
make
it
all
seem
mockery
so
none
may
say
that
the
dwarf
fears
snarks
and
grumkins.
Oh,
deftly
done.вЂќ

Littlefinger
stroked
his
beard.
вЂњDo
you
truly
mean
to
send
away
all
your
guards,
Lannister?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
I
mean
to
send
away
all
my
sisterвЂ™s
guards.вЂќ

вЂњThe
queen
will
never
allow
that.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
think
she
may.
I
am
her
brother,
and
when
youвЂ™ve
known
me
longer,
youвЂ™ll
learn
that
I
mean
everything
I
say.вЂќ

вЂњEven
the
lies?вЂќ

вЂњEspecially
the
lies.
Lord
Petyr,
I
sense
that
you
are
unhappy
with
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
love
you
as
much
as
I
ever
have,
my
lord.
Though
I
do
not
relish
being
played
for
a
fool.
if
Myrcella
weds
Trystane
Martell,
she
can
scarcely
wed
Robert
Arryn,
can
she?вЂќ

вЂњNot
without
causing
a
great
scandal,вЂќ
he
admitted.
вЂњI
regret
my
little
ruse,
Lord
Petyr,
but
when
we
spoke,
I
could
not
know
the
Dornishmen
would
accept
my
offer.вЂќ

Littlefinger
was
not
appeased.
вЂњI
do
not
like
being
lied
to,
my
lord.
Leave
me
out
of
your
next
deception.вЂќ

Only
if
youвЂ™ll
do
the
same
for
me,
Tyrion
thought,
glancing
at
the
dagger
sheathed
at
LittlefingerвЂ™s
hip.
вЂњIf
I
have
given
offense,
I
am
deeply
sorry.
All
men
know
how
much
we
love
you,
my
lord.
And
how
much
we
need
you.вЂќ

вЂњTry
and
remember
that.вЂќ
With
that
Littlefinger
left
them.

вЂњWalk
with
me,
Varys,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
They
left
through
the
kingвЂ™s
door
behind
the
throne,
the
eunuchвЂ™s
slippers
whisking
lightly
over
the
stone.

вЂњLord
Baelish
has
the
truth
of
it,
you
know.
The
queen
will
never
permit
you
to
send
away
her
guard.вЂќ

вЂњShe
will.
YouвЂ™ll
see
to
that.вЂќ

A
smile
flickered
across
VarysвЂ™s
plump
lips.
вЂњWill
I?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
for
a
certainty.
YouвЂ™ll
tell
her
it
is
part
of
my
scheme
to
free
Jaime.вЂќ

Varys
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
вЂњThis
would
doubtless
involve
the
four
men
your
man
Bronn
searched
for
so
diligently
in
all
the
low
places
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
A
thief,
a
poisoner,
a
mummer,
and
a
murderer.вЂќ

вЂњPut
them
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion
helms,
theyвЂ™ll
look
no
different
from
any
other
guardsmen.
I
searched
for
some
time
for
a
ruse
that
might
get
them
into
Riverrun
before
I
thought
to
hide
them
in
plain
sight.
TheyвЂ™ll
ride
in
by
the
main
gate,
flying
Lannister
banners
and
escorting
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
bones.вЂќ
He
smiled
crookedly.
вЂњFour
men
alone
would
be
watched
vigilantly.
Four
among
a
hundred
can
lose
themselves.
So
I
must
send
the
true
guardsmen
as
well
as
the
falseвЂ¦
as
youвЂ™ll
tell
my
sister.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
for
the
sake
of
her
beloved
brother,
she
will
consent,
despite
her
misgivings.вЂќ
They
made
their
way
down
a
deserted
colonnade.
вЂњStill,
the
loss
of
her
red
cloaks
will
surely
make
her
uneasy.вЂќ

вЂњI
like
her
uneasy,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.

Ser
Cleos
Frey
left
that
very
afternoon,
escorted
by
Vylarr
and
a
hundred
red-cloaked
Lannister
guardsmen.
The
men
Robb
Stark
had
sent
joined
them
at
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate
for
the
long
ride
west.

Tyrion
found
Timett
dicing
with
his
Burned
Men
in
the
barracks.
вЂњCome
to
my
solar
at
midnight.вЂќ
Timett
gave
him
a
hard
one-eyed
stare,
a
curt
nod.
He
was
not
one
for
long
speeches.

That
night
he
feasted
with
the
Stone
Crows
and
Moon
Brothers
in
the
Small
Hall,
though
he
shunned
the
wine
for
once.
He
wanted
all
his
wits
about
him.
вЂњShagga,
what
moon
is
this?вЂќ

ShaggaвЂ™s
frown
was
a
fierce
thing.
вЂњBlack,
I
think.вЂќ

вЂњIn
the
west,
they
call
that
a
traitorвЂ™s
moon.
Try
not
to
get
too
drunk
tonight,
and
see
that
your
axe
is
sharp.вЂќ

вЂњA
Stone
CrowвЂ™s
axe
is
always
sharp,
and
ShaggaвЂ™s
axes
are
sharpest
of
all.
Once
I
cut
off
a
manвЂ™s
head,
but
he
did
not
know
it
until
he
tried
to
brush
his
hair.
Then
it
fell
off.вЂќ

вЂњIs
that
why
you
never
brush
yours?вЂќ
The
Stone
Crows
roared
and
stamped
their
feet,
Shagga
hooting
loudest
of
all.

By
midnight,
the
castle
was
silent
and
dark.
Doubtless
a
few
gold
cloaks
on
the
walls
spied
them
leaving
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
no
one
raised
a
voice.
He
was
the
Hand
of
the
King,
and
where
he
went
was
his
own
affair.

The
thin
wooden
door
split
with
a
thunderous
crack
beneath
the
heel
of
ShaggaвЂ™s
boot.
Pieces
went
flying
inward,
and
Tyrion
heard
a
womanвЂ™s
gasp
of
fear.
Shagga
hacked
the
door
apart
with
three
great
blows
of
his
axe
and
kicked
his
way
through
the
ruins.
Timett
followed,
and
then
Tyrion,
stepping
gingerly
over
the
splinters.
The
fire
had
burned
down
a
few
glowing
embers,
and
shadows
lay
thick
across
the
bedchamber.
When
Timett
ripped
the
heavy
curtains
off
the
bed,
the
naked
serving
girl
stared
up
with
wide
white
eyes.
вЂњPlease,
my
lords,вЂќ
she
pleaded,
вЂњdonвЂ™t
hurt
me.вЂќ
She
cringed
away
from
Shagga,
flushed
and
fearful,
trying
to
cover
her
charms
with
her
hands
and
coming
up
a
hand
short.

вЂњGo,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
her.
вЂњItвЂ™s
not
you
we
want.вЂќ

вЂњShagga
wants
this
woman.вЂќ

вЂњShagga
wants
every
whore
in
this
city
of
whores,вЂќ
complained
Timett
son
of
Timett.

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Shagga
said,
unabashed.
вЂњShagga
would
give
her
a
strong
child.вЂќ

вЂњIf
she
wants
a
strong
child,
sheвЂ™ll
know
whom
to
seek,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњTimett,
see
her
outвЂ¦
gently,
if
you
would.вЂќ

The
Burned
Man
pulled
the
girl
from
the
bed
and
half
marched,
half
dragged
her
across
the
chamber.
Shagga
watched
them
go,
mournful
as
a
puppy.
The
girl
stumbled
over
the
shattered
door
and
out
into
the
hall,
helped
along
by
a
firm
shove
from
Timett.
Above
their
heads,
the
ravens
were
screeching.

Tyrion
dragged
the
soft
blanket
off
the
bed,
uncovering
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
beneath.
вЂњTell
me,
does
the
Citadel
approve
of
you
bedding
the
serving
wenches,
Maester?вЂќ

The
old
man
was
as
naked
as
the
girl,
though
he
made
a
markedly
less
attractive
sight.
For
once,
his
heavy-lidded
eyes
were
open
wide.
вЂњW-what
is
the
meaning
of
this?
I
am
an
old
man,
your
loyal
servantвЂ¦вЂќ

Tyrion
hoisted
himself
onto
the
bed.
вЂњSo
loyal
that
you
sent
only
one
of
my
letters
to
Doran
Martell.
The
other
you
gave
to
my
sister.вЂќ

вЂњN-no,вЂќ
squealed
Pycelle.
вЂњNo,
a
falsehood,
I
swear
it,
it
was
not
me.
Varys,
it
was
Varys,
the
Spider,
I
warned
youвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDo
all
maesters
lie
so
poorly?
I
told
Varys
that
I
was
giving
Prince
Doran
my
nephew
Tommen
to
foster.
I
told
Littlefinger
that
I
planned
to
wed
Myrcella
to
Lord
Robert
of
the
Eyrie.
I
told
no
one
that
I
had
offered
Myrcella
to
the
DornishвЂ¦
that
truth
was
only
in
the
letter
I
entrusted
to
you.вЂќ

Pycelle
clutched
for
a
corner
of
the
blanket.
вЂњBirds
are
lost,
messages
stolen
or
soldвЂ¦
it
was
Varys,
there
are
things
I
might
tell
you
of
that
eunuch
that
would
chill
your
bloodвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњMy
lady
prefers
my
blood
hot.вЂќ

вЂњMake
no
mistake,
for
every
secret
the
eunuch
whispers
in
your
ear,
he
holds
seven
back.
And
Littlefinger,
that
oneвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
know
all
about
Lord
Petyr.
HeвЂ™s
almost
as
untrustworthy
as
you.
Shagga,
cut
off
his
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats.вЂќ

Shagga
hefted
the
huge
double-bladed
axe.
вЂњThere
are
no
goats,
Halfman.вЂќ

вЂњMake
do.вЂќ

Roaring,
Shagga
leapt
forward.
Pycelle
shrieked
and
wet
the
bed,
urine
spraying
in
all
directions
as
he
tried
to
scramble
back
out
of
reach.
The
wildling
caught
him
by
the
end
of
his
billowy
white
beard
and
hacked
off
three-quarters
of
it
with
a
single
slash
of
the
axe.

вЂњTimett,
do
you
suppose
our
friend
will
be
more
forthcoming
without
those
whiskers
to
hide
behind?вЂќ
Tyrion
used
a
bit
of
the
sheet
to
wipe
the
piss
off
his
boots.

вЂњHe
will
tell
the
truth
soon.вЂќ
Darkness
pooled
in
the
empty
pit
of
TimettвЂ™s
burned
eye.
вЂњI
can
smell
the
stink
of
his
fear.вЂќ

Shagga
tossed
a
handful
of
hair
down
to
the
rushes,
and
seized
what
beard
was
left.
вЂњHold
still,
Maester,вЂќ
urged
Tyrion.
вЂњWhen
Shagga
gets
angry,
his
hands
shake.вЂќ

вЂњShaggaвЂ™s
hands
never
shake,вЂќ
the
huge
man
said
indignantly,
pressing
the
great
crescent
blade
under
PycelleвЂ™s
quivering
chin
and
sawing
through
another
tangle
of
beard.

вЂњHow
long
have
you
been
spying
for
my
sister?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked.

PycelleвЂ™s
breathing
was
rapid
and
shallow.
вЂњAll
I
did,
I
did
for
House
Lannister.вЂќ
A
sheen
of
sweat
covered
the
broad
dome
of
the
old
manвЂ™s
brow,
and
wisps
of
white
hair
clung
to
his
wrinkled
skin.
вЂњAlwaysвЂ¦
for
yearsвЂ¦
your
lord
father,
ask
him,
I
was
ever
his
true
servantвЂ¦вЂ™twas
I
who
bid
Aerys
open
his
gatesвЂ¦вЂќ

That
took
Tyrion
by
surprise.
He
had
been
no
more
than
an
ugly
boy
at
Casterly
Rock
when
the
city
fell.
вЂњSo
the
Sack
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing
was
your
work
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњFor
the
realm!
Once
Rhaegar
died,
the
war
was
done.
Aerys
was
mad,
Viserys
too
young,
Prince
Aegon
a
babe
at
the
breast,
but
the
realm
needed
a
kingвЂ¦
I
prayed
it
should
be
your
good
father,
but
Robert
was
too
strong,
and
Lord
Stark
moved
too
swiftlyвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHow
many
have
you
betrayed,
I
wonder?
Aerys,
Eddard
Stark,
meвЂ¦
King
Robert
as
well?
Lord
Arryn,
Prince
Rhaegar?
Where
does
it
begin,
Pycelle?вЂќ
He
knew
where
it
ended.

The
axe
scratched
at
the
apple
of
PycelleвЂ™s
throat
and
stroked
the
soft
wobbly
skin
under
his
jaw,
scraping
away
the
last
hairs.
вЂњYouвЂ¦
were
not
here,вЂќ
he
gasped
when
the
blade
moved
upward
to
his
cheeks.
вЂњRobertвЂ¦
his
woundsвЂ¦
if
you
had
seen
them,
smelled
them,
you
would
have
no
doubtвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
know
the
boar
did
your
work
for
youвЂ¦
but
if
heвЂ™d
left
the
job
half
done,
doubtless
you
would
have
finished
it.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
a
wretched
kingвЂ¦
vain,
drunken,
lecherousвЂ¦
he
would
have
set
your
sister
aside,
his
own
queenвЂ¦
pleaseвЂ¦
Renly
was
plotting
to
bring
the
Highgarden
maid
to
court,
to
entice
his
brotherвЂ¦
it
is
the
godsвЂ™
own
truthвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
was
Lord
Arryn
plotting?вЂќ

вЂњHe
knew,вЂќ
Pycelle
said.
вЂњAboutвЂ¦
aboutвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
know
what
he
knew
about,вЂќ
snapped
Tyrion,
who
was
not
anxious
for
Shagga
and
Timett
to
know
as
well.

вЂњHe
was
sending
his
wife
back
to
the
Eyrie,
and
his
son
to
be
fostered
on
DragonstoneвЂ¦
he
meant
to
actвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSo
you
poisoned
him
first.вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
Pycelle
struggled
feebly.
Shagga
growled
and
grabbed
his
head.
The
clansmanвЂ™s
hand
was
so
big
he
could
have
crushed
the
maesterвЂ™s
skull
like
an
eggshell
had
he
squeezed.

Tyrion
tsked
at
him.
вЂњI
saw
the
tears
of
Lys
among
your
potions.
And
you
sent
away
Lord
ArrynвЂ™s
own
maester
and
tended
him
yourself,
so
you
could
make
certain
that
he
died.вЂќ

вЂњA
falsehood!вЂќ

вЂњShave
him
closer,вЂќ
Tyrion
suggested.
вЂњThe
throat
again.вЂќ

The
axe
swept
back
down,
rasping
over
the
skin.
A
thin
film
of
spit
bubbled
on
PycelleвЂ™s
lips
as
his
mouth
trembled.
вЂњI
tried
to
save
Lord
Arryn.
I
vowвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњCareful
now,
Shagga,
youвЂ™ve
cut
him.вЂќ

Shagga
growled.
вЂњDolf
fathered
warriors,
not
barbers.вЂќ

When
he
felt
the
blood
trickling
down
his
neck
and
onto
his
chest,
the
old
man
shuddered,
and
the
last
strength
went
out
of
him.
He
looked
shrunken,
both
smaller
and
frailer
than
he
had
been
when
they
burst
in
on
him.
вЂњYes,вЂќ
he
wimpered,
вЂњyes,
Colemon
was
purging,
so
I
sent
him
away.
The
queen
needed
Lord
Arryn
dead,
she
did
not
say
so,
could
not,
Varys
was
listening,
always
listening,
but
when
I
looked
at
her
I
knew.
It
was
not
me
who
gave
him
the
poison,
though,
I
swear
it.вЂќ
The
old
man
wept.
вЂњVarys
will
tell
you,
it
was
the
boy,
his
squire,
Hugh
he
was
called,
he
must
surely
have
done
it,
ask
your
sister,
ask
her.вЂќ

Tyrion
was
disgusted.
вЂњBind
him
and
take
him
away,вЂќ
he
commanded.
вЂњThrow
him
down
in
one
of
the
black
cells.вЂќ

They
dragged
him
out
the
splintered
door.
вЂњLannister,вЂќ
he
moaned,
вЂњall
IвЂ™ve
done
has
been
for
LannisterвЂ¦вЂќ

When
he
was
gone,
Tyrion
made
a
leisurely
search
of
the
quarters
and
collected
a
few
more
small
jars
from
his
shelves.
The
ravens
muttered
above
his
head
as
he
worked,
a
strangely
peaceful
noise.
He
would
need
to
find
someone
to
tend
the
birds
until
the
Citadel
sent
a
man
to
replace
Pycelle.

He
was
the
one
IвЂ™d
hoped
to
trust.
Varys
and
Littlefinger
were
no
more
loyal,
he
suspectedвЂ¦
only
more
subtle,
and
thus
more
dangerous.
Perhaps
his
fatherвЂ™s
way
would
have
been
best:
summon
Ilyn
Payne,
mount
three
heads
above
the
gates,
and
have
done.
And
wouldnвЂ™t
that
be
a
pretty
sight,
he
thought.





ARYA

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
Arya
would
tell
herself,
but
that
did
not
make
the
fear
go
away.
It
was
as
much
a
part
of
her
days
as
stale
bread
and
the
blisters
on
her
toes
after
a
long
day
of
walking
the
hard,
rutted
road.

She
had
thought
she
had
known
what
it
meant
to
be
afraid,
but
she
learned
better
in
that
storehouse
beside
the
Gods
Eye.
Eight
days
she
had
lingered
there
before
the
Mountain
gave
the
command
to
march,
and
every
day
she
had
seen
someone
die.

The
Mountain
would
come
into
the
storehouse
after
he
had
broken
his
fast
and
pick
one
of
the
prisoners
for
questioning.
The
village
folk
would
never
look
at
him.
Maybe
they
thought
that
if
they
did
not
notice
him,
he
would
not
notice
themвЂ¦
but
he
saw
them
anyway
and
picked
whom
he
liked.
There
was
no
place
to
hide,
no
tricks
to
play,
no
way
to
be
safe.

One
girl
shared
a
soldierвЂ™s
bed
three
nights
running;
the
Mountain
picked
her
on
the
fourth
day,
and
the
soldier
said
nothing.

A
smiley
old
man
mended
their
clothing
and
babbled
about
his
son,
off
serving
in
the
gold
cloaks
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
вЂњA
kingвЂ™s
man,
he
is,вЂќ
he
would
say,
вЂњa
good
kingвЂ™s
man
like
me,
all
for
Joffrey.вЂќ
He
said
it
so
often
the
other
captives
began
to
call
him
All-for-Joffrey
whenever
the
guards
werenвЂ™t
listening.
All-for-Joffrey
was
picked
on
the
fifth
day.

A
young
mother
with
a
pox-scarred
face
offered
to
freely
tell
them
all
she
knew
if
theyвЂ™d
promise
not
to
hurt
her
daughter.
The
Mountain
heard
her
out;
the
next
morning
he
picked
her
daughter,
to
be
certain
sheвЂ™d
held
nothing
back.

The
ones
chosen
were
questioned
in
full
view
of
the
other
captives,
so
they
could
see
the
fate
of
rebels
and
traitors.
A
man
the
others
called
the
Tickler
asked
the
questions.
His
face
was
so
ordinary
and
his
garb
so
plain
that
Arya
might
have
thought
him
one
of
the
villagers
before
she
had
seen
him
at
his
work.
вЂњTickler
makes
them
howl
so
hard
they
piss
themselves,вЂќ
old
stoop-shoulder
Chiswyck
told
them.
He
was
the
man
sheвЂ™d
tried
to
bite,
whoвЂ™d
called
her
a
fierce
little
thing
and
smashed
her
head
with
a
mailed
fist.
Sometimes
he
helped
the
Tickler.
Sometimes
others
did
that.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
himself
would
stand
motionless,
watching
and
listening,
until
the
victim
died.

The
questions
were
always
the
same.
Was
there
gold
hidden
in
the
village?
Silver,
gems?
Was
there
more
food?
Where
was
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion?
Which
of
the
village
folk
had
aided
him?
When
he
rode
off,
where
did
he
go?
How
many
men
were
with
them?
How
many
knights,
how
many
bowmen,
how
many
men-at-arms?
How
were
they
armed?
How
many
were
horsed?
How
many
were
wounded?
What
other
enemy
had
they
seen?
How
many?
When?
What
banners
did
they
fly?
Where
did
they
go?
Was
there
gold
hidden
in
the
village?
Silver,
gems?
Where
was
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion?
How
many
men
were
with
him?
By
the
third
day,
Arya
could
have
asked
the
questions
herself.

They
found
a
little
gold,
a
little
silver,
a
great
sack
of
copper
pennies,
and
a
dented
goblet
set
with
garnets
that
two
soldiers
almost
came
to
blows
over.
They
learned
that
Lord
Beric
had
ten
starvelings
with
him,
or
else
a
hundred
mounted
knights;
that
he
had
ridden
west,
or
north,
or
south;
that
he
had
crossed
the
lake
in
a
boat;
that
he
was
strong
as
an
aurochs
or
weak
from
the
bloody
flux.
No
one
ever
survived
the
TicklerвЂ™s
questioning;
no
man,
no
woman,
no
child.
The
strongest
lasted
past
evenfall.
Their
bodies
were
hung
beyond
the
fires
for
the
wolves.

By
the
time
they
marched,
Arya
knew
she
was
no
water
dancer.
Syrio
Forel
would
never
have
let
them
knock
him
down
and
take
his
sword
away,
nor
stood
by
when
they
killed
Lommy
Greenhands.
Syrio
would
never
have
sat
silent
in
that
storehouse
nor
shuffled
along
meekly
among
the
other
captives.
The
direwolf
was
the
sigil
of
the
Starks,
but
Arya
felt
more
a
lamb,
surrounded
by
a
herd
of
other
sheep.
She
hated
the
villagers
for
their
sheepishness,
almost
as
much
as
she
hated
herself.

The
Lannisters
had
taken
everything:
father,
friends,
home,
hope,
courage.
One
had
taken
Needle,
while
another
had
broken
her
wooden
stick
sword
over
his
knee.
They
had
even
taken
her
stupid
secret.
The
storehouse
had
been
big
enough
for
her
to
creep
off
and
make
her
water
in
some
corner
when
no
one
was
looking,
but
it
was
different
on
the
road.
She
held
it
as
long
as
she
could,
but
finally
she
had
to
squat
by
a
bush
and
skin
down
her
breeches
in
front
of
all
of
them.
It
was
that
or
wet
herself.
Hot
Pie
gaped
at
her
with
big
moon
eyes,
but
no
one
else
even
troubled
to
look.
Girl
sheep
or
boy
sheep,
Ser
Gregor
and
his
men
did
not
seem
to
care.

Their
captors
permitted
no
chatter.
A
broken
lip
taught
Arya
to
hold
her
tongue.
Others
never
learned
at
all.
One
boy
of
three
would
not
stop
calling
for
his
father,
so
they
smashed
his
face
in
with
a
spiked
mace.
Then
the
boyвЂ™s
mother
started
screaming
and
Raff
the
Sweetling
killed
her
as
well.

Arya
watched
them
die
and
did
nothing.
What
good
did
it
do
you
to
be
brave?
One
of
the
women
picked
for
questioning
had
tried
to
be
brave,
but
she
had
died
screaming
like
all
the
rest.
There
were
no
brave
people
on
that
march,
only
scared
and
hungry
ones.
Most
were
women
and
children.
The
few
men
were
very
old
or
very
young;
the
rest
had
been
chained
to
that
gibbet
and
left
for
the
wolves
and
the
crows.
Gendry
was
only
spared
because
heвЂ™d
admitted
to
forging
the
horned
helm
himself;
smiths,
even
apprentice
smiths,
were
too
valuable
to
kill.

They
were
being
taken
to
serve
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
at
Harrenhal,
the
Mountain
told
them.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
traitors
and
rebels,
so
thank
your
gods
that
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
giving
you
this
chance.
ItвЂ™s
more
than
youвЂ™d
get
from
the
outlaws.
Obey,
serve,
and
live.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
not
just,
itвЂ™s
not,вЂќ
she
heard
one
wizened
old
woman
complain
to
another
when
they
had
bedded
down
for
the
night.
вЂњWe
never
did
no
treason,
the
others
come
in
and
took
what
they
wanted,
same
as
this
bunch.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Beric
did
us
no
hurt,
though,вЂќ
her
friend
whispered.
вЂњAnd
that
red
priest
with
him,
he
paid
for
all
they
took.вЂќ

вЂњPaid?
He
took
two
of
my
chickens
and
gave
me
a
bit
of
paper
with
a
mark
on
it.
Can
I
eat
a
bit
of
raggy
old
paper,
I
ask
you?
Will
it
give
me
eggs?вЂќ
She
looked
about
to
see
that
no
guards
were
near,
and
spat
three
times.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
for
the
Tullys
and
thereвЂ™s
for
the
Lannisters
and
thereвЂ™s
for
the
Starks.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
a
sin
and
a
shame,вЂќ
an
old
man
hissed.
вЂњWhen
the
old
king
was
still
alive,
heвЂ™d
not
have
stood
for
this.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Robert?вЂќ
Arya
asked,
forgetting
herself.

вЂњKing
Aerys,
gods
grace
him,вЂќ
the
old
man
said,
too
loudly.
A
guard
came
sauntering
over
to
shut
them
up.
The
old
man
lost
both
his
teeth,
and
there
was
no
more
talk
that
night.

Besides
his
captives,
Ser
Gregor
was
bringing
back
a
dozen
pigs,
a
cage
of
chickens,
a
scrawny
milk
cow,
and
nine
wagons
of
salt
fish.
The
Mountain
and
his
men
had
horses,
but
the
captives
were
all
afoot,
and
those
too
weak
to
keep
up
were
killed
out
of
hand,
along
with
anyone
foolish
enough
to
flee.
The
guards
took
women
off
into
the
bushes
at
night,
and
most
seemed
to
expect
it
and
went
along
meekly
enough.
One
girl,
prettier
than
the
others,
was
made
to
go
with
four
or
five
different
men
every
night,
until
finally
she
hit
one
with
a
rock.
Ser
Gregor
made
everyone
watch
while
he
took
off
her
head
with
a
sweep
of
his
massive
two-handed
greatsword.
вЂњLeave
the
body
for
the
wolves,вЂќ
he
commanded
when
the
deed
was
done,
handing
the
sword
to
his
squire
to
be
cleaned.

Arya
glanced
sidelong
at
Needle,
sheathed
at
the
hip
of
a
black-bearded,
balding
man-at-arms
called
Polliver.
ItвЂ™s
good
that
they
took
it
away,
she
thought.
Otherwise
she
would
have
tried
to
stab
Ser
Gregor,
and
he
would
have
cut
her
right
in
half,
and
the
wolves
would
eat
her
too.

Polliver
was
not
so
bad
as
some
of
the
others,
even
though
heвЂ™d
stolen
Needle.
The
night
she
was
caught,
the
Lannister
men
had
been
nameless
strangers
with
faces
as
alike
as
their
nasal
helms,
but
sheвЂ™d
come
to
know
them
all.
You
had
to
know
who
was
lazy
and
who
was
cruel,
who
was
smart
and
who
was
stupid.
You
had
to
learn
that
even
though
the
one
they
called
Shitmouth
had
the
foulest
tongue
sheвЂ™d
ever
heard,
heвЂ™d
give
you
an
extra
piece
of
bread
if
you
asked,
while
jolly
old
Chiswyck
and
soft-spoken
Raff
would
just
give
you
the
back
of
their
hand.

Arya
watched
and
listened
and
polished
her
hates
the
way
Gendry
had
once
polished
his
horned
helm.
Dunsen
wore
those
bullвЂ™s
horns
now,
and
she
hated
him
for
it.
She
hated
Polliver
for
Needle,
and
she
hated
old
Chiswyck
who
thought
he
was
funny.
And
Raff
the
Sweetling,
whoвЂ™d
driven
his
spear
through
LommyвЂ™s
throat,
she
hated
even
more.
She
hated
Ser
Amory
Lorch
for
Yoren,
and
she
hated
Ser
Meryn
Trant
for
Syrio,
the
Hound
for
killing
the
butcherвЂ™s
boy
Mycah,
and
Ser
Ilyn
and
Prince
Joffrey
and
the
queen
for
the
sake
of
her
father
and
Fat
Tom
and
Desmond
and
the
rest,
and
even
for
Lady,
SansaвЂ™s
wolf.
The
Tickler
was
almost
too
scary
to
hate.
At
times
she
could
almost
forget
he
was
still
with
them;
when
he
was
not
asking
questions,
he
was
just
another
soldier,
quieter
than
most,
with
a
face
like
a
thousand
other
men.

Every
night
Arya
would
say
their
names.
вЂњSer
Gregor,вЂќ
sheвЂ™d
whisper
to
her
stone
pillow.
вЂњDunsen,
Polliver,
Chiswyck,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.вЂќ
Back
in
Winterfell,
Arya
had
prayed
with
her
mother
in
the
sept
and
with
her
father
in
the
godswood,
but
there
were
no
gods
on
the
road
to
Harrenhal,
and
her
names
were
the
only
prayer
she
cared
to
remember.

Every
day
they
marched,
and
every
night
she
said
her
names,
until
finally
the
trees
thinned
and
gave
way
to
a
patchwork
landscape
of
rolling
hills,
meandering
streams,
and
sunlit
fields,
where
the
husks
of
burnt
holdfasts
thrust
up
black
as
rotten
teeth.
It
was
another
long
dayвЂ™s
march
before
they
glimpsed
the
towers
of
Harrenhal
in
the
distance,
hard
beside
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake.

It
would
be
better
once
they
got
to
Harrenhal,
the
captives
told
each
other,
but
Arya
was
not
so
certain.
She
remembered
Old
NanвЂ™s
stories
of
the
castle
built
on
fear.
Harren
the
Black
had
mixed
human
blood
in
the
mortar,
Nan
used
to
say,
dropping
her
voice
so
the
children
would
need
to
lean
close
to
hear,
but
AegonвЂ™s
dragons
had
roasted
Harren
and
all
his
sons
within
their
great
walls
of
stone.
Arya
chewed
her
lip
as
she
walked
along
on
feet
grown
hard
with
callus.
It
would
not
be
much
longer,
she
told
herself;
those
towers
could
not
be
more
than
a
few
miles
off.

Yet
they
walked
all
that
day
and
most
of
the
next
before
at
last
they
reached
the
fringes
of
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
army,
encamped
west
of
the
castle
amidst
the
scorched
remains
of
a
town.
Harrenhal
was
deceptive
from
afar,
because
it
was
so
huge.
Its
colossal
curtain
walls
rose
beside
the
lake,
sheer
and
sudden
as
mountain
cliffs,
while
atop
their
battlements
the
rows
of
wood-and-iron
scorpions
looked
as
small
as
the
bugs
for
which
they
were
named.

The
stink
of
the
Lannister
host
reached
Arya
well
before
she
could
make
out
the
devices
on
the
banners
that
sprouted
along
the
lakeshore,
atop
the
pavilions
of
the
westermen.
From
the
smell,
Arya
could
tell
that
Lord
Tywin
had
been
here
some
time.
The
latrines
that
ringed
the
encampment
were
overflowing
and
swarming
with
flies,
and
she
saw
faint
greenish
fuzz
on
many
of
the
sharpened
stakes
that
protected
the
perimeters.

HarrenhalвЂ™s
gatehouse,
itself
as
large
as
WinterfellвЂ™s
Great
Keep,
was
as
scarred
as
it
was
massive,
its
stones
fissured
and
discolored.
From
outside,
only
the
tops
of
five
immense
towers
could
be
seen
beyond
the
walls.
The
shortest
of
them
was
half
again
as
tall
as
the
highest
tower
in
Winterfell,
but
they
did
not
soar
the
way
a
proper
tower
did.
Arya
thought
they
looked
like
some
old
manвЂ™s
gnarled,
knuckly
fingers
groping
after
a
passing
cloud.
She
remembered
Nan
telling
how
the
stone
had
melted
and
flowed
like
candlewax
down
the
steps
and
in
the
windows,
glowing
a
sullen
searing
red
as
it
sought
out
Harren
where
he
hid.
Arya
could
believe
every
word;
each
tower
was
more
grotesque
and
misshapen
than
the
last,
lumpy
and
runneled
and
cracked.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to
go
there,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
squeaked
as
Harrenhal
opened
its
gates
to
them.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
ghosts
in
there.вЂќ

Chiswyck
heard
him,
but
for
once
he
only
smiled.
вЂњBaker
boy,
hereвЂ™s
your
choice.
Come
join
the
ghosts,
or
be
one.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
went
in
with
the
rest
of
them.

In
the
echoing
stone-and-timber
bathhouse,
the
captives
were
stripped
and
made
to
scrub
and
scrape
themselves
raw
in
tubs
of
scalding
hot
water.
Two
fierce
old
women
supervised
the
process,
discussing
them
as
bluntly
as
if
they
were
newly
acquired
donkeys.
When
AryaвЂ™s
turn
came
round,
Goodwife
Amabel
clucked
in
dismay
at
the
sight
of
her
feet,
while
Goodwife
Harra
felt
the
callus
on
her
fingers
that
long
hours
of
practice
with
Needle
had
earned
her.
вЂњGot
those
churning
butter,
IвЂ™ll
wager,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњSome
farmerвЂ™s
whelp,
are
you?
Well,
never
you
mind,
girl,
you
have
a
chance
to
win
a
higher
place
in
this
world
if
you
work
hard.
If
you
wonвЂ™t
work
hard,
youвЂ™ll
be
beaten.
And
what
do
they
call
you?вЂќ

Arya
dared
not
say
her
true
name,
but
Arry
was
no
good
either,
it
was
a
boyвЂ™s
name
and
they
could
see
she
was
no
boy.
вЂњWeasel,вЂќ
she
said,
naming
the
first
girl
she
could
think
of.
вЂњLommy
called
me
Weasel.вЂќ

вЂњI
can
see
why,вЂќ
sniffed
Goodwife
Amabel.
вЂњThat
hair
is
a
fright
and
a
nest
for
lice
as
well.
WeвЂ™ll
have
it
off,
and
then
youвЂ™re
for
the
kitchens.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
tend
the
horses.вЂќ
Arya
liked
horses,
and
maybe
if
she
was
in
the
stables
sheвЂ™d
be
able
to
steal
one
and
escape.

Goodwife
Harra
slapped
her
so
hard
that
her
swollen
lip
broke
open
all
over
again.
вЂњAnd
keep
that
tongue
to
yourself
or
youвЂ™ll
get
worse.
No
one
asked
your
views.вЂќ

The
blood
in
her
mouth
had
a
salty
metal
tang
to
it.
Arya
dropped
her
gaze
and
said
nothing.
If
I
still
had
Needle,
she
wouldnвЂ™t
dare
hit
me,
she
thought
sullenly.

вЂњLord
Tywin
and
his
knights
have
grooms
and
squires
to
tend
their
horses,
they
donвЂ™t
need
the
likes
of
you,вЂќ
Goodwife
Amabel
said.
вЂњThe
kitchens
are
snug
and
clean,
and
thereвЂ™s
always
a
warm
fire
to
sleep
by
and
plenty
to
eat.
You
might
have
done
well
there,
but
I
can
see
youвЂ™re
not
a
clever
girl.
Harra,
I
believe
we
should
give
this
one
to
Weese.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
think
so,
Amabel.вЂќ
They
gave
her
a
shift
of
grey
roughspun
wool
and
a
pair
of
ill-fitting
shoes,
and
sent
her
off.

Weese
was
understeward
for
the
Wailing
Tower,
a
squat
man
with
a
fleshy
carbuncle
of
a
nose
and
a
nest
of
angry
red
boils
near
one
corner
of
his
plump
lips.
Arya
was
one
of
six
sent
to
him.
He
looked
them
all
over
with
a
gimlet
eye.
вЂњThe
Lannisters
are
generous
to
those
as
serve
them
well,
an
honor
none
of
your
sort
deserve,
but
in
war
a
man
makes
do
with
whatвЂ™s
to
hand.
Work
hard
and
mind
your
place
and
might
be
one
day
youвЂ™ll
rise
as
high
as
me.
If
you
think
to
presume
on
his
lordshipвЂ™s
kindness,
though,
youвЂ™ll
find
me
waiting
after
mвЂ™lord
has
gone,
yвЂ™see.вЂќ
He
strutted
up
and
down
before
them,
telling
them
how
they
must
never
look
the
highborn
in
the
eye,
nor
speak
until
spoken
to,
nor
get
in
his
lordshipвЂ™s
way.
вЂњMy
nose
never
lies,вЂќ
he
boasted.
вЂњI
can
smell
defiance,
I
can
smell
pride,
I
can
smell
disobedience.
I
catch
a
whiff
of
any
such
stinks,
youвЂ™ll
answer
for
it.
When
I
sniff
you,
all
I
want
to
smell
is
fear.вЂќ





DAENERYS

On
the
walls
of
Qarth,
men
beat
gongs
to
herald
her
coming,
while
others
blew
curious
horns
that
encircled
their
bodies
like
great
bronze
snakes.
A
column
of
camelry
emerged
from
the
city
as
her
honor
guards.
The
riders
wore
scaled
copper
armor
and
snouted
helms
with
copper
tusks
and
long
black
silk
plumes,
and
sat
high
on
saddles
inlaid
with
rubies
and
garnets.
Their
camels
were
dressed
in
blankets
of
a
hundred
different
hues.

вЂњQarth
is
the
greatest
city
that
ever
was
or
ever
will
be,вЂќ
Pyat
Pree
had
told
her,
back
amongst
the
bones
of
Vaes
Tolorro.
вЂњIt
is
the
center
of
the
world,
the
gate
between
north
and
south,
the
bridge
between
east
and
west,
ancient
beyond
memory
of
man
and
so
magnificent
that
Saathos
the
Wise
put
out
his
eyes
after
gazing
upon
Qarth
for
the
first
time,
because
he
knew
that
all
he
saw
thereafter
should
look
squalid
and
ugly
by
comparison.вЂќ

Dany
took
the
warlockвЂ™s
words
well
salted,
but
the
magnificence
of
the
great
city
was
not
to
be
denied.
Three
thick
walls
encircled
Qarth,
elaborately
carved.
The
outer
was
red
sandstone,
thirty
feet
high
and
decorated
with
animals:
snakes
slithering,
kites
flying,
fish
swimming,
intermingled
with
wolves
of
the
red
waste
and
striped
zorses
and
monstrous
elephants.
The
middle
wall,
forty
feet
high,
was
grey
granite
alive
with
scenes
of
war:
the
clash
of
sword
and
shield
and
spear,
arrows
in
flight,
heroes
at
battle
and
babes
being
butchered,
pyres
of
the
dead.
The
innermost
wall
was
fifty
feet
of
black
marble,
with
carvings
that
made
Dany
blush
until
she
told
herself
that
she
was
being
a
fool.
She
was
no
maid;
if
she
could
look
on
the
grey
wallвЂ™s
scenes
of
slaughter,
why
should
she
avert
her
eyes
from
the
sight
of
men
and
women
giving
pleasure
to
one
another?

The
outer
gates
were
banded
with
copper,
the
middle
with
iron;
the
innermost
were
studded
with
golden
eyes.
All
opened
at
DanyвЂ™s
approach.
As
she
rode
her
silver
into
the
city,
small
children
rushed
out
to
scatter
flowers
in
her
path.
They
wore
golden
sandals
and
bright
paint,
no
more.

All
the
colors
that
had
been
missing
from
Vaes
Tolorro
had
found
their
way
to
Qarth;
buildings
crowded
about
her
fantastical
as
a
fever
dream
in
shades
of
rose,
violet,
and
umber.
She
passed
under
a
bronze
arch
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
two
snakes
mating,
their
scales
delicate
flakes
of
jade,
obsidian,
and
lapis
lazuli.
Slim
towers
stood
taller
than
any
Dany
had
ever
seen,
and
elaborate
fountains
filled
every
square,
wrought
in
the
shapes
of
griffins
and
dragons
and
manticores.

The
Qartheen
lined
the
streets
and
watched
from
delicate
balconies
that
looked
too
frail
to
support
their
weight.
They
were
tall
pale
folk
in
linen
and
samite
and
tiger
fur,
every
one
a
lord
or
lady
to
her
eyes.
The
women
wore
gowns
that
left
one
breast
bare,
while
the
men
favored
beaded
silk
skirts.
Dany
felt
shabby
and
barbaric
as
she
rode
past
them
in
her
lionskin
robe
with
black
Drogon
on
one
shoulder.
Her
Dothraki
called
the
Qartheen
вЂњMilk
MenвЂќ
for
their
paleness,
and
Khal
Drogo
had
dreamed
of
the
day
when
he
might
sack
the
great
cities
of
the
east.
She
glanced
at
her
bloodriders,
their
dark
almond-shaped
eyes
giving
no
hint
of
their
thoughts.
Is
it
only
the
plunder
they
see?
she
wondered.
How
savage
we
must
seem
to
these
Qartheen.

Pyrat
Pree
conducted
her
little
khalasar
down
the
center
of
a
great
arcade
where
the
cityвЂ™s
ancient
heroes
stood
thrice
life-size
on
columns
of
white
and
green
marble.
They
passed
through
a
bazaar
in
a
cavernous
building
whose
latticework
ceiling
was
home
to
a
thousand
gaily
colored
birds.
Trees
and
flowers
bloomed
on
the
terraced
walls
above
the
stalls,
while
below
it
seemed
as
if
everything
the
gods
had
put
into
the
world
was
for
sale.

Her
silver
shied
as
the
merchant
prince
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
rode
up
to
her;
the
horses
could
not
abide
the
close
presence
of
camels,
she
had
found.
вЂњIf
you
see
here
anything
that
you
would
desire,
O
most
beautiful
of
women,
you
have
only
to
speak
and
it
is
yours,вЂќ
Xaro
called
down
from
his
ornate
horned
saddle.

вЂњQarth
itself
is
hers,
she
has
no
need
of
baubles,вЂќ
blue-lipped
Pyat
Pree
sang
out
from
her
other
side.
вЂњIt
shall
be
as
I
promised,
Khaleesi.
Come
with
me
to
the
House
of
the
Undying,
and
you
shall
drink
of
truth
and
wisdom.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
she
need
your
Palace
of
Dust,
when
I
can
give
her
sunlight
and
sweet
water
and
silks
to
sleep
in?вЂќ
Xaro
said
to
the
warlock.
вЂњThe
Thirteen
shall
set
a
crown
of
black
jade
and
fire
opals
upon
her
lovely
head.вЂќ

вЂњThe
only
palace
I
desire
is
the
red
castle
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
my
lord
Pyat.вЂќ
Dany
was
wary
of
the
warlock;
the
maegi
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
soured
her
on
those
who
played
at
sorcery.
вЂњAnd
if
the
great
of
Qarth
would
give
me
gifts,
Xaro,
let
them
give
me
ships
and
swords
to
win
back
what
is
rightfully
mine.вЂќ

PyatвЂ™s
blue
lips
curled
upward
in
a
gracious
smile.
вЂњit
shall
be
as
you
command,
Khaleesi.вЂќ
He
moved
away,
swaying
with
his
camelвЂ™s
motion,
his
long
beaded
robes
trailing
behind.

вЂњThe
young
queen
is
wise
beyond
her
years,вЂќ
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
murmured
down
at
her
from
his
high
saddle.
вЂњThere
is
a
saying
in
Qarth.
A
warlockвЂ™s
house
is
built
of
bones
and
lies.вЂќ

вЂњThen
why
do
men
lower
their
voices
when
they
speak
of
the
warlocks
of
Qarth?
All
across
the
east,
their
power
and
wisdom
are
revered.вЂќ

вЂњOnce
they
were
mighty,вЂќ
Xaro
agreed,
вЂњbut
now
they
are
as
ludicrous
as
those
feeble
old
soldiers
who
boast
of
their
prowess
long
after
strength
and
skill
have
left
them.
They
read
their
crumbling
scrolls,
drink
shade-of-the-evening
until
their
lips
turn
blue,
and
hint
of
dread
powers,
but
they
are
hollow
husks
compared
to
those
who
went
before.
Pyat
PreeвЂ™s
gifts
will
turn
to
dust
in
your
hands,
I
warn
you.вЂќ
He
gave
his
camel
a
lick
of
his
whip
and
sped
away.

вЂњThe
crow
calls
the
raven
black,вЂќ
muttered
Ser
Jorah
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros.
The
exile
knight
rode
at
her
right
hand,
as
ever.
For
their
entrance
into
Qarth,
he
had
put
away
his
Dothraki
garb
and
donned
again
the
plate
and
mail
and
wool
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
half
a
world
away.
вЂњYou
would
do
well
to
avoid
both
those
men,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњThose
men
will
help
me
to
my
crown,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњXaro
has
vast
wealth,
and
Pyat
PreeвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”pretends
to
power,вЂќ
the
knight
said
brusquely.
On
his
dark
green
surcoat,
the
bear
of
House
Mormont
stood
on
its
hind
legs,
black
and
fierce.
Jorah
looked
no
less
ferocious
as
he
scowled
at
the
crowd
that
filled
the
bazaar.
вЂњI
would
not
linger
here
long,
my
queen.
I
mislike
the
very
smell
of
this
place.вЂќ

Dany
smiled.
вЂњPerhaps
itвЂ™s
the
camels
youвЂ™re
smelling.
The
Qartheen
themselves
seem
sweet
enough
to
my
nose.вЂќ

вЂњSweet
smells
are
sometimes
used
to
cover
foul
ones.вЂќ

My
great
bear,
Dany
thought.
I
am
his
queen,
but
I
will
always
be
his
cub
as
well,
and
he
will
always
guard
me.
It
made
her
feel
safe,
but
sad
as
well.
She
wished
she
could
love
him
better
than
she
did.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
had
offered
Dany
the
hospitality
of
his
home
while
she
was
in
the
city.
She
had
expected
something
grand.
She
had
not
expected
a
palace
larger
than
many
a
market
town.
It
makes
Magister
IllyrioвЂ™s
manse
in
Pentos
look
like
a
swineherdвЂ™s
hovel,
she
thought.
Xaro
swore
that
his
home
could
comfortably
house
all
of
her
people
and
their
horses
besides;
indeed,
it
swallowed
them.
An
entire
wing
was
given
over
to
her.
She
would
have
her
own
gardens,
a
marble
bathing
pool,
a
scrying
tower
and
warlockвЂ™s
maze.
Slaves
would
tend
her
every
need.
In
her
private
chambers,
the
floors
were
green
marble,
the
walls
draped
with
colorful
silk
hangings
that
shimmered
with
every
breath
of
air.
вЂњYou
are
too
generous,вЂќ
she
told
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.

вЂњFor
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
no
gift
is
too
great.вЂќ
Xaro
was
a
languid,
elegant
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
crusted
with
rubies,
opals,
and
flakes
of
jade.
вЂњOn
the
morrow,
you
shall
feast
upon
peacock
and
larkвЂ™s
tongue,
and
hear
music
worthy
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women.
The
Thirteen
will
come
to
do
you
homage,
and
all
the
great
of
Qarth.вЂќ

All
the
great
of
Qarth
will
come
to
see
my
dragons,
Dany
thought,
yet
she
thanked
Xaro
for
his
kindness
before
she
sent
him
on
his
way.
Pyat
Pree
took
his
leave
as
well,
vowing
to
petition
the
Undying
Ones
for
an
audience.
вЂњA
honor
rare
as
summer
snows.вЂќ
Before
he
left
he
kissed
her
bare
feet
with
his
pale
blue
lips
and
pressed
on
her
a
gift,
a
jar
of
ointment
that
he
swore
would
let
her
see
the
spirits
of
the
air.
Last
of
the
three
seekers
to
depart
was
Quaithe
the
shadowbinder.
From
her
Dany
received
only
a
warning.
вЂњBeware,вЂќ
the
woman
in
the
red
lacquer
mask
said.

вЂњOf
whom?вЂќ

вЂњOf
all.
They
shall
come
day
and
night
to
see
the
wonder
that
has
been
born
again
into
the
world,
and
when
they
see
they
shall
lust.
For
dragons
are
fire
made
flesh,
and
fire
is
power.вЂќ

When
Quaithe
too
was
gone,
Ser
Jorah
said,
вЂњShe
speaks
truly,
my
queenвЂ¦
though
I
like
her
no
more
than
the
others.вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
understand
her.вЂќ
Pyat
and
Xaro
had
showered
Dany
with
promises
from
the
moment
they
first
glimpsed
her
dragons,
declaring
themselves
her
loyal
servants
in
all
things,
but
from
Quaithe
she
had
gotten
only
the
rare
cryptic
word.
And
it
disturbed
her
that
she
had
never
seen
the
womanвЂ™s
face.
Remember
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
she
told
herself.
Remember
treachery.
She
turned
to
her
bloodriders.
вЂњWe
will
keep
our
own
watch
so
long
as
we
are
here.
See
that
no
one
enters
this
wing
of
the
palace
without
my
leave,
and
take
care
that
the
dragons
are
always
well
guarded.вЂќ

вЂњIt
shall
be
done,
Khaleesi,вЂќ
Aggo
said.

вЂњWe
have
seen
only
the
parts
of
Qarth
that
Pyat
Pree
wished
us
to
see,вЂќ
she
went
on.
вЂњRakharo,
go
forth
and
look
on
the
rest,
and
tell
me
what
you
find.
Take
good
men
with
youвЂ”and
women,
to
go
places
where
men
are
forbidden.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
I
do,
blood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
said
Rakharo.

вЂњSer
Jorah,
find
the
docks
and
see
what
manner
of
ships
lay
at
anchor.
It
has
been
half
a
year
since
I
last
heard
tidings
from
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Perhaps
the
gods
will
have
blown
some
good
captain
here
from
Westeros
with
a
ship
to
carry
us
home.вЂќ

The
knight
frowned.
вЂњThat
would
be
no
kindness.
The
Usurper
will
kill
you,
sure
as
sunrise.вЂќ
Mormont
hooked
his
thumbs
through
his
swordbelt.
вЂњMy
place
is
here
at
your
side.вЂќ

вЂњJhogo
can
guard
me
as
well.
You
have
more
languages
than
my
bloodriders,
and
the
Dothraki
mistrust
the
sea
and
those
who
sail
her.
Only
you
can
serve
me
in
this.
Go
among
the
ships
and
speak
to
the
crews,
learn
where
they
are
from
and
where
they
are
bound
and
what
manner
of
men
command
them.вЂќ

Reluctantly,
the
exile
nodded.
вЂњAs
you
say,
my
queen.вЂќ

When
all
the
men
had
gone,
her
handmaids
stripped
off
the
travel-stained
silks
she
wore,
and
Dany
padded
out
to
where
the
marble
pool
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
portico.
The
water
was
deliciously
cool,
and
the
pool
was
stocked
with
tiny
golden
fish
that
nibbled
curiously
at
her
skin
and
made
her
giggle.
It
felt
good
to
close
her
eyes
and
float,
knowing
she
could
rest
as
long
as
she
liked.
She
wondered
whether
AegonвЂ™s
Red
Keep
had
a
pool
like
this,
and
fragrant
gardens
full
of
lavender
and
mint.
It
must,
surely.
Viserys
always
said
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
more
beautiful
than
any
other
place
in
the
world.

The
thought
of
home
disquieted
her.
If
her
sun-and-stars
had
lived,
he
would
have
led
his
khalasar
across
the
poison
water
and
swept
away
her
enemies,
but
his
strength
had
left
the
world.
Her
bloodriders
remained,
sworn
to
her
for
life
and
skilled
in
slaughter,
but
only
in
the
ways
of
the
horselords.
The
Dothraki
sacked
cities
and
plundered
kingdoms,
they
did
not
rule
them.
Dany
had
no
wish
to
reduce
KingвЂ™s
Landing
to
a
blackened
ruin
full
of
unquiet
ghosts.
She
had
supped
enough
on
tears.
I
want
to
make
my
kingdom
beautiful,
to
fill
it
with
fat
men
and
pretty
maids
and
laughing
children.
I
want
my
people
to
smile
when
they
see
me
ride
by,
the
way
Viserys
said
they
smiled
for
my
father.

But
before
she
could
do
that
she
must
conquer.

The
Usurper
will
kill
you,
sure
as
sunrise,
Mormont
had
said.
Robert
had
slain
her
gallant
brother
Rhaegar,
and
one
of
his
creatures
had
crossed
the
Dothraki
sea
to
poison
her
and
her
unborn
son.
They
said
Robert
Baratheon
was
strong
as
a
bull
and
fearless
in
battle,
a
man
who
loved
nothing
better
than
war.
And
with
him
stood
the
great
lords
her
brother
had
named
the
UsurperвЂ™s
dogs,
cold-eyed
Eddard
Stark
with
his
frozen
heart,
and
the
golden
Lannisters,
father
and
son,
so
rich,
so
powerful,
so
treacherous.

How
could
she
hope
to
overthrow
such
men?
When
Khal
Drogo
had
lived,
men
trembled
and
made
him
gifts
to
stay
his
wrath.
If
they
did
not,
he
took
their
cities,
wealth
and
wives
and
all.
But
his
khalasar
had
been
vast,
while
hers
was
meager.
Her
people
had
followed
her
across
the
red
waste
as
she
chased
her
comet,
and
would
follow
her
across
the
poison
water
too,
but
they
would
not
be
enough.
Even
her
dragons
might
not
be
enough.
Viserys
had
believed
that
the
realm
would
rise
for
its
rightful
kingвЂ¦
but
Viserys
had
been
a
fool,
and
fools
believe
in
foolish
things.

Her
doubts
made
her
shiver.
Suddenly
the
water
felt
cold
to
her,
and
the
little
fish
prickling
at
her
skin
annoying.
Dany
stood
and
climbed
from
the
pool.
вЂњIrri,вЂќ
she
called,
вЂњJhiqui.вЂќ

As
the
handmaids
toweled
her
dry
and
wrapped
her
in
a
sandsilk
robe,
DanyвЂ™s
thoughts
went
to
the
three
who
had
sought
her
out
in
the
City
of
Bones.
The
Bleeding
Star
led
me
to
Qarth
for
a
purpose.
Here
I
will
find
what
I
need,
if
I
have
the
strength
to
take
what
is
offered,
and
the
wisdom
to
avoid
the
traps
and
snares.
If
the
gods
mean
for
me
to
conquer,
they
will
provide,
they
will
send
me
a
sign,
and
if
notвЂ¦
if
notвЂ¦

It
was
near
evenfall
and
Dany
was
feeding
her
dragons
when
Irri
stepped
through
the
silken
curtains
to
tell
her
that
Ser
Jorah
had
returned
from
the
docksвЂ¦
and
not
alone.
вЂњSend
him
in,
with
whomever
he
has
brought,вЂќ
she
said,
curious.

When
they
entered,
she
was
seated
on
a
mound
of
cushions,
her
dragons
all
about
her.
The
man
he
brought
with
him
wore
a
cloak
of
green
and
yellow
feathers
and
had
skin
as
black
as
polished
jet.
вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
the
knight
said,
вЂњI
bring
you
Quhuru
Mo,
captain
of
the
Cinnamon
Wind
out
of
Tall
Trees
Town.вЂќ

The
black
man
knelt.
вЂњI
am
greatly
honored,
my
queen,вЂќ
he
said;
not
in
the
tongue
of
the
Summer
Isles,
which
Dany
did
not
know,
but
in
the
liquid
Valyrian
of
the
Nine
Free
Cities.

вЂњThe
honor
is
mine,
Quhuru
Mo,вЂќ
said
Dany
in
the
same
language.
вЂњHave
you
come
from
the
Summer
Isles?вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
so,
Your
Grace,
but
before,
not
half
a
year
past,
we
called
at
Oldtown.
From
there
I
bring
you
a
wondrous
gift.вЂќ

вЂњA
gift?вЂќ

вЂњA
gift
of
news.
Dragonmother,
Stormborn,
I
tell
you
true,
Robert
Baratheon
is
dead.вЂќ

Outside
her
walls,
dusk
was
settling
over
Qarth,
but
a
sun
had
risen
in
DanyвЂ™s
heart.
вЂњDead?вЂќ
she
repeated.
In
her
lap,
black
Drogon
hissed,
and
pale
smoke
rose
before
her
face
like
a
veil.
вЂњYou
are
certain?
The
Usurper
is
dead?вЂќ

вЂњSo
it
is
said
in
Oldtown,
and
Dorne,
and
Lys,
and
all
the
other
ports
where
we
have
called.вЂќ

He
sent
me
poisoned
wine,
yet
I
live
and
he
is
gone.
вЂњWhat
was
the
manner
of
his
death?вЂќ
On
her
shoulder,
pale
Viserion
flapped
wings
the
color
of
cream,
stirring
the
air.

вЂњTorn
by
a
monstrous
boar
whilst
hunting
in
his
kingswood,
or
so
I
heard
in
Oldtown.
Others
say
his
queen
betrayed
him,
or
his
brother,
or
Lord
Stark
who
was
his
Hand.
Yet
all
the
tales
agree
in
this:
King
Robert
is
dead
and
in
his
grave.вЂќ

Dany
had
never
looked
upon
the
UsurperвЂ™s
face,
yet
seldom
a
day
had
passed
when
she
had
not
thought
of
him.
His
great
shadow
had
lain
across
her
since
the
hour
of
her
birth,
when
she
came
forth
amidst
blood
and
storm
into
a
world
where
she
no
longer
had
a
place.
And
now
this
ebony
stranger
had
lifted
that
shadow.

вЂњThe
boy
sits
the
Iron
Throne
now,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said.

вЂњKing
Joffrey
reigns,вЂќ
Quhuru
Mo
agreed,
вЂњbut
the
Lannisters
rule.
RobertвЂ™s
brothers
have
fled
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
The
talk
is,
they
mean
to
claim
the
crown.
And
the
Hand
has
fallen,
Lord
Stark
who
was
King
RobertвЂ™s
friend.
He
has
been
seized
for
treason.вЂќ

вЂњNed
Stark
a
traitor?вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
snorted.
вЂњNot
bloody
likely.
The
Long
Summer
will
come
again
before
that
one
would
besmirch
his
precious
honor.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
honor
could
he
have?вЂќ
Dany
said.
вЂњHe
was
a
traitor
to
his
true
king,
as
were
these
Lannisters.вЂќ
It
pleased
her
to
hear
that
the
UsurperвЂ™s
dogs
were
fighting
amongst
themselves,
though
she
was
unsurprised.
The
same
thing
happened
when
her
Drogo
died,
and
his
great
khalasar
tore
itself
to
pieces.
вЂњMy
brother
is
dead
as
well,
Viserys
who
was
the
true
king,вЂќ
she
told
the
Summer
Islander.
вЂњKhal
Drogo
my
lord
husband
killed
him
with
a
crown
of
molten
gold.вЂќ
Would
her
brother
have
been
any
wiser,
had
he
known
that
the
vengeance
he
had
prayed
for
was
so
close
at
hand?

вЂњThen
I
grieve
for
you,
Dragonmother,
and
for
bleeding
Westeros,
bereft
of
its
rightful
king.вЂќ

Beneath
DanyвЂ™s
gentle
fingers,
green
Rhaegal
stared
at
the
stranger
with
eyes
of
molten
gold.
When
his
mouth
opened,
his
teeth
gleamed
like
black
needles.
вЂњWhen
does
your
ship
return
to
Westeros,
Captain?вЂќ

вЂњNot
for
a
year
or
more,
I
fear.
From
here
the
Cinnamon
Wind
sails
east,
to
make
the
traderвЂ™s
circle
round
the
Jade
Sea.вЂќ

вЂњI
see,вЂќ
said
Dany,
disappointed.
вЂњI
wish
you
fair
winds
and
good
trading,
then.
You
have
brought
me
a
precious
gift.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
been
amply
repaid,
great
queen.вЂќ

She
puzzled
at
that.
вЂњHow
so?вЂќ

His
eyes
gleamed.
вЂњI
have
seen
dragons.вЂќ

Dany
laughed.
вЂњAnd
will
see
more
of
them
one
day,
I
hope.
Come
to
me
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
when
I
am
on
my
fatherвЂ™s
throne,
and
you
shall
have
a
great
reward.вЂќ

The
Summer
Islander
promised
he
would
do
so,
and
kissed
her
lightly
on
the
fingers
as
he
took
his
leave.
Jhiqui
showed
him
out,
while
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
remained.

вЂњKhaleesi,вЂќ
the
knight
said
when
they
were
alone,
вЂњI
should
not
speak
so
freely
of
your
plans,
if
I
were
you.
This
man
will
spread
the
tale
wherever
he
goes
now.вЂќ

вЂњLet
him,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњLet
the
whole
world
know
my
purpose.
The
Usurper
is
dead,
what
does
it
matter?вЂќ

вЂњNot
every
sailorвЂ™s
tale
is
true,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
cautioned,
вЂњand
even
if
Robert
be
truly
dead,
his
son
rules
in
his
place.
This
changes
nothing,
truly.вЂќ

вЂњThis
changes
everything.вЂќ
Dany
rose
abruptly.
Screeching,
her
dragons
uncoiled
and
spread
their
wings.
Drogon
flapped
and
clawed
up
to
the
lintel
over
the
archway.
The
others
skittered
across
the
floor,
wingtips
scrabbling
on
the
marble.
вЂњBefore,
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
like
my
DrogoвЂ™s
khalasar,
a
hundred
thousand
made
as
one
by
his
strength.
Now
they
fly
to
pieces,
even
as
the
khalasar
did
after
my
khal
lay
dead.вЂќ

вЂњThe
high
lords
have
always
fought.
Tell
me
whoвЂ™s
won
and
IвЂ™ll
tell
you
what
it
means.
Khaleesi,
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
not
going
to
fall
into
your
hands
like
so
many
ripe
peaches.
You
will
need
a
fleet,
gold,
armies,
alliancesвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњAll
this
I
know.вЂќ
She
took
his
hands
in
hers
and
looked
up
into
his
dark
suspicious
eyes.
Sometimes
he
thinks
of
me
as
a
child
he
must
protect,
and
sometimes
as
a
woman
he
would
like
to
bed,
but
does
he
ever
truly
see
me
as
his
queen?
вЂњI
am
not
the
frightened
girl
you
met
in
Pentos.
I
have
counted
only
fifteen
name
days,
trueвЂ¦
but
I
am
as
old
as
the
crones
in
the
dosh
khaleen
and
as
young
as
my
dragons,
Jorah.
I
have
borne
a
child,
burned
a
khal,
and
crossed
the
red
waste
and
the
Dothraki
sea.
Mine
is
the
blood
of
the
dragon.вЂќ

вЂњAs
was
your
brotherвЂ™s,вЂќ
he
said
stubbornly.

вЂњI
am
not
Viserys.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
admitted.
вЂњThere
is
more
of
Rhaegar
in
you,
I
think,
but
even
Rhaegar
could
be
slain.
Robert
proved
that
on
the
Trident,
with
no
more
than
a
warhammer.
Even
dragons
can
die.вЂќ

вЂњDragons
die.вЂќ
She
stood
on
her
toes
to
kiss
him
lightly
on
an
unshaven
cheek.
вЂњBut
so
do
dragonslayers.вЂќ





BRAN

Meera
moved
in
a
wary
circle,
her
net
dangling
loose
in
her
left
hand,
the
slender
three-pronged
frog
spear
poised
in
her
right.
Summer
followed
her
with
his
golden
eyes,
turning,
his
tail
held
stiff
and
tall.
Watching,
watchingвЂ¦

вЂњYai!вЂќ
the
girl
shouted,
the
spear
darting
out.
The
wolf
slid
to
the
left
and
leapt
before
she
could
draw
back
the
spear.
Meera
cast
her
net,
the
tangles
unfolding
in
the
air
before
her.
SummerвЂ™s
leap
carried
him
into
it.
He
dragged
it
with
him
as
he
slammed
into
her
chest
and
knocked
her
over
backward.
Her
spear
went
spinning
away.
The
damp
grass
cushioned
her
fall
but
the
breath
went
out
of
her
in
an
вЂњOof.вЂќ
The
wolf
crouched
atop
her.

Bran
hooted.
вЂњYou
lose.вЂќ

вЂњShe
wins,вЂќ
her
brother
Jojen
said.
вЂњSummerвЂ™s
snared.вЂќ

He
was
right,
Bran
saw.
Thrashing
and
growling
at
the
net,
trying
to
rip
free,
Summer
was
only
ensnaring
himself
worse.
Nor
could
he
bite
through.
вЂњLet
him
out.вЂќ

Laughing,
the
Reed
girl
threw
her
arms
around
the
tangled
wolf
and
rolled
them
both.
Summer
gave
a
piteous
whine,
his
legs
kicking
against
the
cords
that
bound
them.
Meera
knelt,
undid
a
twist,
pulled
at
a
corner,
tugged
deftly
here
and
there,
and
suddenly
the
direwolf
was
bounding
free.

вЂњSummer,
to
me.вЂќ
Bran
spread
his
arms.
вЂњWatch,вЂќ
he
said,
an
instant
before
the
wolf
bowled
into
him.
He
clung
with
all
his
strength
as
the
wolf
dragged
him
bumping
through
the
grass.
They
wrestled
and
rolled
and
clung
to
each
other,
one
snarling
and
yapping,
the
other
laughing.
In
the
end
it
was
Bran
sprawled
on
top,
the
mud-spattered
direwolf
under
him.
вЂњGood
wolf,вЂќ
he
panted.
Summer
licked
him
across
the
ear.

Meera
shook
her
head.
вЂњDoes
he
never
grow
angry?вЂќ

вЂњNot
with
me.вЂќ
Bran
grabbed
the
wolf
by
his
ears
and
Summer
snapped
at
him
fiercely,
but
it
was
all
in
play.
вЂњSometimes
he
tears
my
garb
but
heвЂ™s
never
drawn
blood.вЂќ

вЂњYour
blood,
you
mean.
If
heвЂ™d
gotten
past
my
netвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHe
wouldnвЂ™t
hurt
you.
He
knows
I
like
you.вЂќ
All
of
the
other
lords
and
knights
had
departed
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
harvest
feast,
but
the
Reeds
had
stayed
to
become
BranвЂ™s
constant
companions.
Jojen
was
so
solemn
that
Old
Nan
called
him
вЂњlittle
grandfather,вЂќ
but
Meera
reminded
Bran
of
his
sister
Arya.
She
wasnвЂ™t
scared
to
get
dirty,
and
she
could
run
and
fight
and
throw
as
good
as
a
boy.
She
was
older
than
Arya,
though;
almost
sixteen,
a
woman
grown.
They
were
both
older
than
Bran,
even
though
his
ninth
name
day
had
finally
come
and
gone,
but
they
never
treated
him
like
a
child.

вЂњI
wish
you
were
our
wards
instead
of
the
Walders.вЂќ
He
began
to
struggle
toward
the
nearest
tree.
His
dragging
and
wriggling
was
unseemly
to
watch,
but
when
Meera
moved
to
lift
him
he
said,
вЂњNo,
donвЂ™t
help
me.вЂќ
He
rolled
clumsily
and
pushed
and
squirmed
backward,
using
the
strength
of
his
arms,
until
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
trunk
of
a
tall
ash.
вЂњSee,
I
told
you.вЂќ
Summer
lay
down
with
his
head
in
BranвЂ™s
lap.
вЂњI
never
knew
anyone
who
fought
with
a
net
before,вЂќ
he
told
Meera
while
he
scratched
the
direwolf
between
the
ears.
вЂњDid
your
master-at-arms
teach
you
net-fighting?вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
taught
me.
We
have
no
knights
at
Greywater.
No
master-at-arms,
and
no
maester.вЂќ

вЂњWho
keeps
your
ravens?вЂќ

She
smiled.
вЂњRavens
canвЂ™t
find
Greywater
Watch,
no
more
than
our
enemies
can.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
not?вЂќ

вЂњBecause
it
moves,вЂќ
she
told
him.

Bran
had
never
heard
of
a
moving
castle
before.
He
looked
at
her
uncertainly,
but
he
couldnвЂ™t
tell
whether
she
was
teasing
him
or
not.
вЂњI
wish
I
could
see
it.
Do
you
think
your
lord
father
would
let
me
come
visit
when
the
war
is
over?вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
be
most
welcome,
my
prince.
Then
or
now.вЂќ

вЂњNow?вЂќ
Bran
had
spent
his
whole
life
at
Winterfell.
He
yearned
to
see
far
places.
вЂњI
could
ask
Ser
Rodrik
when
he
returns.вЂќ
The
old
knight
was
off
east,
trying
to
set
to
rights
the
trouble
there.
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
bastard
had
started
it
by
seizing
Lady
Hornwood
as
she
returned
from
the
harvest
feast,
marrying
her
that
very
night
even
though
he
was
young
enough
to
be
her
son.
Then
Lord
Manderly
had
taken
her
castle.
To
protect
the
Hornwood
holdings
from
the
Boltons,
he
had
written,
but
Ser
Rodrik
had
been
almost
as
angry
with
him
as
with
the
bastard.
вЂњSer
Rodrik
might
let
me
go.
Maester
Luwin
never
would.вЂќ

Sitting
cross-legged
under
the
weirwood,
Jojen
Reed
regarded
him
solemnly.
вЂњIt
would
be
good
if
you
left
Winterfell,
Bran.вЂќ

вЂњIt
would?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
And
sooner
rather
than
later.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brother
has
the
greensight,вЂќ
said
Meera.
вЂњHe
dreams
things
that
havenвЂ™t
happened,
but
sometimes
they
do.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
no
sometimes,
Meera.вЂќ
A
look
passed
between
them;
him
sad,
her
defiant.

вЂњTell
me
whatвЂ™s
going
to
happen,вЂќ
Bran
said.

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
said
Jojen,
вЂњif
youвЂ™ll
tell
me
about
your
dreams.вЂќ

The
godswood
grew
quiet.
Bran
could
hear
leaves
rustling,
and
HodorвЂ™s
distant
splashing
from
the
hot
pools.
He
thought
of
the
golden
man
and
the
three-eyed
crow,
remembered
the
crunch
of
bones
between
his
jaws
and
the
coppery
taste
of
blood.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
have
dreams.
Maester
Luwin
gives
me
sleeping
draughts.вЂќ

вЂњDo
they
help?вЂќ

вЂњSometimes.вЂќ

Meera
said,
вЂњAll
of
Winterfell
knows
you
wake
at
night
shouting
and
sweating,
Bran.
The
women
talk
of
it
at
the
well,
and
the
guards
in
their
hall.вЂќ

вЂњTell
us
what
frightens
you
so
much,вЂќ
said
Jojen.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to.
Anyway,
itвЂ™s
only
dreams.
Maester
Luwin
says
dreams
might
mean
anything
or
nothing.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brother
dreams
as
other
boys
do,
and
those
dreams
might
mean
anything,вЂќ
Meera
said,
вЂњbut
the
green
dreams
are
different.вЂќ

JojenвЂ™s
eyes
were
the
color
of
moss,
and
sometimes
when
he
looked
at
you
he
seemed
to
be
seeing
something
else.
Like
now.
вЂњI
dreamed
of
a
winged
wolf
bound
to
earth
with
grey
stone
chains,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњIt
was
a
green
dream,
so
I
knew
it
was
true.
A
crow
was
trying
to
peck
through
the
chains,
but
the
stone
was
too
hard
and
his
beak
could
only
chip
at
them.вЂќ

вЂњDid
the
crow
have
three
eyes?вЂќ

Jojen
nodded.

Summer
raised
his
head
from
BranвЂ™s
lap,
and
gazed
at
the
mudman
with
his
dark
golden
eyes.

вЂњWhen
I
was
little
I
almost
died
of
greywater
fever.
That
was
when
the
crow
came
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњHe
came
to
me
after
I
fell,вЂќ
Bran
blurted.
вЂњI
was
asleep
for
a
long
time.
He
said
I
had
to
fly
or
die,
and
I
woke
up,
only
I
was
broken
and
I
couldnвЂ™t
fly
after
all.вЂќ

вЂњYou
can
if
you
want
to.вЂќ
Picking
up
her
net,
Meera
shook
out
the
last
tangles
and
began
arranging
it
in
loose
folds.

вЂњYou
are
the
winged
wolf,
Bran,вЂќ
said
Jojen.
вЂњI
wasnвЂ™t
sure
when
we
first
came,
but
now
I
am.
The
crow
sent
us
here
to
break
your
chains.вЂќ

вЂњIs
the
crow
at
Greywater?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
The
crow
is
in
the
north.вЂќ

вЂњAt
the
Wall?вЂќ
Bran
had
always
wanted
to
see
the
Wall.
His
bastard
brother
Jon
was
there
now,
a
man
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.

вЂњBeyond
the
Wall.вЂќ
Meera
Reed
hung
the
net
from
her
belt.
вЂњWhen
Jojen
told
our
lord
father
what
heвЂ™d
dreamed,
he
sent
us
to
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњHow
would
I
break
the
chains,
Jojen?вЂќ
Bran
asked.

вЂњOpen
your
eye.вЂќ

вЂњThey
are
open
CanвЂ™t
you
see?вЂќ

вЂњTwo
are
open.вЂќ
Jojen
pointed.
вЂњOne,
two.вЂќ

вЂњI
only
have
two.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
three.
The
crow
gave
you
the
third,
but
you
will
not
open
it.вЂќ
He
had
a
slow
soft
way
of
speaking.
вЂњWith
two
eyes
you
see
my
face.
With
three
you
could
see
my
heart.
With
two
you
can
see
that
oak
tree
there.
With
three
you
could
see
the
acorn
the
oak
grew
from
and
the
stump
that
it
will
one
day
become.
With
two
you
see
no
farther
than
your
walls.
With
three
you
would
gaze
south
to
the
Summer
Sea
and
north
beyond
the
Wall.вЂќ

Summer
got
to
his
feet.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
need
to
see
so
far.вЂќ
Bran
made
a
nervous
smile.
вЂњIвЂ™m
tired
of
talking
about
crows.
LetвЂ™s
talk
about
wolves.
Or
lizard-lions.
Have
you
ever
hunted
one,
Meera?
We
donвЂ™t
have
them
here.вЂќ

Meera
plucked
her
frog
spear
out
of
the
bushes.
вЂњThey
live
in
the
water.
In
slow
streams
and
deep
swampsвЂ”вЂќ

Her
brother
interrupted.
вЂњDid
you
dream
of
a
lizard-lion?вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњI
told
you,
I
donвЂ™t
wantвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
dream
of
a
wolf?вЂќ

He
was
making
Bran
angry.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
have
to
tell
you
my
dreams.
IвЂ™m
the
prince.
IвЂ™m
the
Stark
in
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњWas
it
Summer?вЂќ

вЂњYou
be
quiet.вЂќ

вЂњThe
night
of
the
harvest
feast,
you
dreamed
you
were
Summer
in
the
godswood,
didnвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

вЂњStop
it!вЂќ
Bran
shouted.
Summer
slid
toward
the
weirwood,
his
white
teeth
bared.

Jojen
Reed
took
no
mind.
вЂњWhen
I
touched
Summer,
I
felt
you
in
him.
just
as
you
are
in
him
now.вЂќ

вЂњYou
couldnвЂ™t
have.
I
was
in
bed.
I
was
sleeping.вЂќ

вЂњYou
were
in
the
godswood,
all
in
grey.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
only
a
bad
dreamвЂ¦вЂќ

Jojen
stood.
вЂњI
felt
you.
I
felt
you
fall.
Is
that
what
scares
you,
the
falling?вЂќ

The
falling,
Bran
thought,
and
the
golden
man,
the
queenвЂ™s
brother,
he
scares
me
too,
but
mostly
the
falling.
He
did
not
say
it,
though.
How
could
he?
He
had
not
been
able
to
tell
Ser
Rodrik
or
Maester
Luwin,
and
he
could
not
tell
the
Reeds
either.
If
he
didnвЂ™t
talk
about
it,
maybe
he
would
forget.
He
had
never
wanted
to
remember.
It
might
not
even
be
a
true
remembering.

вЂњDo
you
fall
every
night,
Bran?вЂќ
Joien
asked
quietly.

A
low
rumbling
growl
rose
from
SummerвЂ™s
throat,
and
there
was
no
play
in
it.
He
stalked
forward,
all
teeth
and
hot
eyes.
Meera
stepped
between
the
wolf
and
her
brother,
spear
in
hand.
вЂњKeep
him
back,
Bran.вЂќ

вЂњJojen
is
making
him
angry.вЂќ

Meera
shook
out
her
net.

вЂњItвЂ™s
your
anger,
Bran,вЂќ
her
brother
said.
вЂњYour
fear.вЂќ

вЂњIt
isnвЂ™t.
IвЂ™m
not
a
wolf.вЂќ
Yet
heвЂ™d
howled
with
them
in
the
night,
and
tasted
blood
in
his
wolf
dreams.

вЂњPart
of
you
is
Summer,
and
part
of
Summer
is
you.
You
know
that,
Bran.вЂќ

Summer
rushed
forward,
but
Meera
blocked
him,
jabbing
with
the
three-pronged
spear.
The
wolf
twisted
aside,
circling,
stalking.
Meera
turned
to
face
him.
вЂњCall
him
back,
Bran.вЂќ

вЂњSummer!вЂќ
Bran
shouted.
вЂњTo
me,
Summer!вЂќ
He
slapped
an
open
palm
down
on
the
meat
of
his
thigh.
His
hand
tingled,
though
his
dead
leg
felt
nothing.

The
direwolf
lunged
again,
and
again
MeeraвЂ™s
spear
darted
out.
Summer
dodged,
circled
back.
The
bushes
rustled,
and
a
lean
black
shape
came
padding
from
behind
the
weirwood,
teeth
bared.
The
scent
was
strong;
his
brother
had
smelled
his
rage.
Bran
felt
hairs
rise
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
Meera
stood
beside
her
brother,
with
wolves
to
either
side.
вЂњBran,
call
them
off.вЂќ

вЂњI
canвЂ™t!вЂќ

вЂњJojen,
up
the
tree.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
no
need.
Today
is
not
the
day
I
die.вЂќ

вЂњDo
it!вЂќ
she
screamed,
and
her
brother
scrambled
up
the
trunk
of
the
weirwood,
using
the
face
for
his
handholds.
The
direwolves
closed.
Meera
abandoned
spear
and
net,
jumped
up,
and
grabbed
the
branch
above
her
head.
ShaggyвЂ™s
jaws
snapped
shut
beneath
her
ankle
as
she
swung
up
and
over
the
limb.
Summer
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
howled,
while
Shaggydog
worried
the
net,
shaking
it
in
his
teeth.

Only
then
did
Bran
remember
that
they
were
not
alone.
He
cupped
hands
around
his
mouth.
вЂњHodor!вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњHodor!
Hodor!вЂќ
He
was
badly
frightened
and
somehow
ashamed.
вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t
hurt
Hodor,вЂќ
he
assured
his
treed
friends.

A
few
moments
passed
before
they
heard
a
tuneless
humming.
Hodor
arrived
half-dressed
and
mud-spattered
from
his
visit
to
the
hot
pools,
but
Bran
had
never
been
so
glad
to
see
him.
вЂњHodor,
help
me.
Chase
off
the
wolves.
Chase
them
off.вЂќ

Hodor
went
to
it
gleefully,
waving
his
arms
and
stamping
his
huge
feet,
shouting
вЂњHodor,
Hodor,вЂќ
running
first
at
one
wolf
and
then
the
other.
Shaggydog
was
the
first
to
flee,
slinking
back
into
the
foliage
with
a
final
snarl.
When
Summer
had
enough,
he
came
back
to
Bran
and
lay
down
beside
him.

No
sooner
did
Meera
touch
ground
than
she
snatched
up
her
spear
and
net
again.
Jojen
never
took
his
eyes
off
Summer.
вЂњWe
will
talk
again,вЂќ
he
promised
Bran.

It
was
the
wolves,
it
wasnвЂ™t
me.
He
did
not
understand
why
theyвЂ™d
gotten
so
wild.
Maybe
Maester
Luwin
was
right
to
lock
them
in
the
godswood.
вЂњHodor,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbring
me
to
Maester
Luwin.вЂќ

The
maesterвЂ™s
turret
below
the
rookery
was
one
of
BranвЂ™s
favorite
places.
Luwin
was
hopelessly
untidy,
but
his
clutter
of
books
and
scrolls
and
bottles
was
as
familiar
and
comforting
to
Bran
as
his
bald
spot
and
the
flapping
sleeves
of
his
loose
grey
robes.
He
liked
the
ravens
too.

He
found
Luwin
perched
on
a
high
stool,
writing.
With
Ser
Rodrik
gone,
all
of
the
governance
of
the
castle
had
fallen
on
his
shoulders.
вЂњMy
prince,вЂќ
he
said
when
Hodor
entered,
вЂњyouвЂ™re
early
for
lessons
today.вЂќ
The
maester
spent
several
hours
every
afternoon
tutoring
Bran,
Rickon,
and
the
Walder
Freys.

вЂњHodor,
stand
still.вЂќ
Bran
grasped
a
wall
sconce
with
both
hands
and
used
it
to
pull
himself
up
and
out
of
the
basket.
He
hung
for
a
moment
by
his
arms
until
Hodor
carried
him
to
a
chair.
вЂњMeera
says
her
brother
has
the
greensight.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
scratched
at
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
writing
quill.
вЂњDoes
she
now?вЂќ

He
nodded.
вЂњYou
told
me
that
the
children
of
the
forest
had
the
greensight.
I
remember.вЂќ

вЂњSome
claimed
to
have
that
power.
Their
wise
men
were
called
greenseers.вЂќ

вЂњWas
it
magic?вЂќ

вЂњCall
it
that
for
want
of
a
better
word,
if
you
must.
At
heart
it
was
only
a
different
sort
of
knowledge.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
was
it?вЂќ

Luwin
set
down
his
quill.
вЂњNo
one
truly
knows,
Bran.
The
children
are
gone
from
the
world,
and
their
wisdom
with
them.
It
had
to
do
with
the
faces
in
the
trees,
we
think.
The
First
Men
believed
that
the
greenseers
could
see
through
the
eyes
of
the
weirwoods.
That
was
why
they
cut
down
the
trees
whenever
they
warred
upon
the
children.
Supposedly
the
greenseers
also
had
power
over
the
beasts
of
the
wood
and
the
birds
in
the
trees.
Even
fish.
Does
the
Reed
boy
claim
such
powers?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
I
donвЂ™t
think.
But
he
has
dreams
that
come
true
sometimes,
Meera
says.вЂќ

вЂњAll
of
us
have
dreams
that
come
true
sometimes.
You
dreamed
of
your
lord
father
in
the
crypts
before
we
knew
he
was
dead,
remember?вЂќ

вЂњRickon
did
too.
We
dreamed
the
same
dream.вЂќ

вЂњCall
it
greensight,
if
you
wishвЂ¦
but
remember
as
well
all
those
tens
of
thousands
of
dreams
that
you
and
Rickon
have
dreamed
that
did
not
come
true.
Do
you
perchance
recall
what
I
taught
you
about
the
chain
collar
that
every
maester
wears?вЂќ

Bran
thought
for
a
moment,
trying
to
remember.
вЂњA
maester
forges
his
chain
in
the
Citadel
of
Oldtown.
ItвЂ™s
a
chain
because
you
swear
to
serve,
and
itвЂ™s
made
of
different
metals
because
you
serve
the
realm
and
the
realm
has
different
sorts
of
people.
Every
time
you
learn
something
you
get
another
link.
Black
iron
is
for
ravenry,
silver
for
healing,
gold
for
sums
and
numbers.
I
donвЂ™t
remember
them
all.вЂќ

Luwin
slid
a
finger
up
under
his
collar
and
began
to
turn
it,
inch
by
inch.
He
had
a
thick
neck
for
a
small
man,
and
the
chain
was
tight,
but
a
few
pulls
had
it
all
the
way
around.
вЂњThis
is
Valyrian
steel,вЂќ
he
said
when
the
link
of
dark
grey
metal
lay
against
the
apple
of
his
throat.
вЂњOnly
one
maester
in
a
hundred
wears
such
a
link.
This
signifies
that
I
have
studied
what
the
Citadel
calls
the
higher
mysteriesвЂ”magic,
for
want
of
a
better
word.
A
fascinating
pursuit,
but
of
small
use,
which
is
why
so
few
maesters
trouble
themselves
with
it.

вЂњAll
those
who
study
the
higher
mysteries
try
their
own
hand
at
spells,
soon
or
late.
I
yielded
to
the
temptation
too,
I
must
confess
it.
Well,
I
was
a
boy,
and
what
boy
does
not
secretly
wish
to
find
hidden
powers
in
himself?
I
got
no
more
for
my
efforts
than
a
thousand
boys
before
me,
and
a
thousand
since.
Sad
to
say,
magic
does
not
work.вЂќ

вЂњSometimes
it
does,вЂќ
Bran
protested.
вЂњI
had
that
dream,
and
Rickon
did
too.
And
there
are
mages
and
warlocks
in
the
eastвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
men
who
call
themselves
mages
and
warlocks,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said.
вЂњI
had
a
friend
at
the
Citadel
who
could
pull
a
rose
out
of
your
ear,
but
he
was
no
more
magical
than
I
was.
Oh,
to
be
sure,
there
is
much
we
do
not
understand.
The
years
pass
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands,
and
what
does
any
man
see
of
life
but
a
few
summers,
a
few
winters?
We
look
at
mountains
and
call
them
eternal,
and
so
they
seemвЂ¦
but
in
the
course
of
time,
mountains
rise
and
fall,
rivers
change
their
courses,
stars
fall
from
the
sky,
and
great
cities
sink
beneath
the
sea.
Even
gods
die,
we
think.
Everything
changes.

вЂњPerhaps
magic
was
once
a
mighty
force
in
the
world,
but
no
longer.
What
little
remains
is
no
more
than
the
wisp
of
smoke
that
lingers
in
the
air
after
a
great
fire
has
burned
out,
and
even
that
is
fading.
Valyria
was
the
last
ember,
and
Valyria
is
gone.
The
dragons
are
no
more,
the
giants
are
dead,
the
children
of
the
forest
forgotten
with
all
their
lore.

вЂњNo,
my
prince.
Jojen
Reed
may
have
had
a
dream
or
two
that
he
believes
came
true,
but
he
does
not
have
the
greensight.
No
living
man
has
that
power.вЂќ

Bran
said
as
much
to
Meera
Reed
when
she
came
to
him
at
dusk
as
he
sat
in
his
window
seat
watching
the
lights
flicker
to
life.
вЂњIвЂ™m
sorry
for
what
happened
with
the
wolves.
Summer
shouldnвЂ™t
have
tried
to
hurt
Jojen,
but
Jojen
shouldnвЂ™t
have
said
all
that
about
my
dreams.
The
crow
lied
when
he
said
I
could
fly,
and
your
brother
lied
too.вЂќ

вЂњOr
perhaps
your
maester
is
wrong.вЂќ

вЂњHe
isnвЂ™t.
Even
my
father
relied
on
his
counsel.вЂќ

вЂњYour
father
listened,
I
have
no
doubt.
But
in
the
end,
he
decided
for
himself.
Bran,
will
you
let
me
tell
you
about
a
dream
Jojen
dreamed
of
you
and
your
fosterling
brothers?вЂќ

вЂњThe
Walders
arenвЂ™t
my
brothers.вЂќ

She
paid
that
no
heed.
вЂњYou
were
sitting
at
supper,
but
instead
of
a
servant,
Maester
Luwin
brought
you
your
food.
He
served
you
the
kingвЂ™s
cut
off
the
roast,
the
meat
rare
and
bloody,
but
with
a
savory
smell
that
made
everyoneвЂ™s
mouth
water.
The
meat
he
served
the
Freys
was
old
and
grey
and
dead.
Yet
they
liked
their
supper
better
than
you
liked
yours.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
understand.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will,
my
brother
says.
When
you
do,
weвЂ™ll
talk
again.вЂќ

Bran
was
almost
afraid
to
sit
to
supper
that
night,
but
when
he
did,
it
was
pigeon
pie
they
set
before
him.
Everyone
else
was
served
the
same,
and
he
couldnвЂ™t
see
that
anything
was
wrong
with
the
food
they
served
the
Walders.
Maester
Luwin
has
the
truth
of
it,
he
told
himself.
Nothing
bad
was
coming
to
Winterfell,
no
matter
what
Jojen
said.
Bran
was
relievedвЂ¦
but
disappointed
too.
So
long
as
there
was
magic,
anything
could
happen.
Ghosts
could
walk,
trees
could
talk,
and
broken
boys
could
grow
up
to
be
knights.
вЂњBut
there
isnвЂ™t,вЂќ
he
said
aloud
in
the
darkness
of
his
bed.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
no
magic,
and
the
stories
are
just
stories.вЂќ

And
he
would
never
walk,
nor
fly,
nor
be
a
knight.





TYRION

The
rushes
were
scratchy
under
the
soles
of
his
bare
feet.
вЂњMy
cousin
chooses
a
queer
hour
to
come
visiting,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
a
sleep-befuddled
Podrick
Payne,
whoвЂ™d
doubtless
expected
to
be
well
roasted
for
waking
him.
вЂњSee
him
to
my
solar
and
tell
him
IвЂ™ll
be
down
shortly.вЂќ

It
was
well
past
midnight,
he
judged
from
the
black
outside
the
window.
Does
Lancel
think
to
find
me
drowsy
and
slow
of
wit
at
this
hour?
he
wondered.
No,
Lancel
scarce
thinks
at
all,
this
is
CerseiвЂ™s
doing.
His
sister
would
be
disappointed.
Even
abed,
he
worked
well
into
the
morningвЂ”reading
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
candle,
scrutinizing
the
reports
of
VarysвЂ™s
whisperers,
and
poring
over
LittlefingerвЂ™s
books
of
accounts
until
the
columns
blurred
and
his
eyes
ached.

He
splashed
some
tepid
water
on
his
face
from
the
basin
beside
his
bed
and
took
his
time
squatting
in
the
garderobe,
the
night
air
cold
on
his
bare
skin.
Ser
Lancel
was
sixteen,
and
not
known
for
his
patience.
Let
him
wait,
and
grow
more
anxious
in
the
waiting.
When
his
bowels
were
empty,
Tyrion
slipped
on
a
bedrobe
and
roughed
his
thin
flaxen
hair
with
his
fingers,
all
the
more
to
look
as
if
he
had
wakened
from
sleep.

Lancel
was
pacing
before
the
ashes
of
the
hearth,
garbed
in
slashed
red
velvet
with
black
silk
undersleeves,
a
jeweled
dagger
and
a
gilded
scabbard
hanging
from
his
swordbelt.
вЂњCousin,вЂќ
Tyrion
greeted
him.
вЂњYour
visits
are
too
few.
To
what
do
I
owe
this
undeserved
pleasure?вЂќ

вЂњHer
Grace
the
Queen
Regent
has
sent
me
to
command
you
to
release
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.вЂќ
Ser
Lancel
showed
Tyrion
a
crimson
ribbon,
bearing
CerseiвЂ™s
lion
seal
impressed
in
golden
wax.
вЂњHere
is
her
warrant.вЂќ

вЂњSo
it
is.вЂќ
Tyrion
waved
it
away.
вЂњI
hope
my
sister
is
not
overtaxing
her
strength,
so
soon
after
her
illness.
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
she
were
to
suffer
a
relapse.вЂќ

вЂњHer
Grace
is
quite
recovered,вЂќ
Ser
Lancel
said
curtly.

вЂњMusic
to
my
ears.вЂќ
Though
not
a
tune
IвЂ™m
fond
of.
I
should
have
given
her
a
larger
dose.
Tyrion
had
hoped
for
a
few
more
days
without
CerseiвЂ™s
interference,
but
he
was
not
too
terribly
surprised
by
her
return
to
health.
She
was
JaimeвЂ™s
twin,
after
all.
He
made
himself
smile
pleasantly.
вЂњPod,
build
us
a
fire,
the
air
is
too
chilly
for
my
taste.
Will
you
take
a
cup
with
me,
Lancel?
I
find
that
mulled
wine
helps
me
sleep.вЂќ

вЂњI
need
no
help
sleeping,вЂќ
Ser
Lancel
said.
вЂњI
am
come
at
Her
GraceвЂ™s
behest,
not
to
drink
with
you,
Imp.вЂќ

Knighthood
had
made
the
boy
bolder,
Tyrion
reflectedвЂ”that,
and
the
sorry
part
he
had
played
in
murdering
King
Robert.
вЂњWine
does
have
its
dangers.вЂќ
He
smiled
as
he
poured.
вЂњAs
to
Grand
Maester
PycelleвЂ¦
if
my
sweet
sister
is
so
concerned
for
him,
I
would
have
thought
sheвЂ™d
come
herself.
Instead
she
sends
you.
What
am
I
to
make
of
that?вЂќ

вЂњMake
of
it
what
you
will,
so
long
as
you
release
your
prisoner.
The
Grand
Maester
is
a
staunch
friend
to
the
Queen
Regent,
and
under
her
personal
protection.вЂќ
A
hint
of
a
sneer
played
about
the
ladвЂ™s
lips;
he
was
enjoying
this.
He
takes
his
lessons
from
Cersei.
вЂњHer
Grace
will
never
consent
to
this
outrage.
She
reminds
you
that
she
is
JoffreyвЂ™s
regent.вЂќ

вЂњAs
I
am
JoffreyвЂ™s
Hand.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Hand
serves,вЂќ
the
young
knight
informed
him
airily.
вЂњThe
regent
rules
until
the
king
is
of
age.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps
you
ought
write
that
down
so
IвЂ™ll
remember
it
better.вЂќ
The
fire
was
crackling
merrily.
вЂњYou
may
leave
us,
Pod,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
his
squire.
Only
when
the
boy
was
gone
did
he
turn
back
to
Lancel.
вЂњThere
is
more?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
Her
Grace
bids
me
inform
you
that
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
defied
a
command
issued
in
the
kingвЂ™s
own
name.вЂќ

Which
means
that
Cersei
has
already
ordered
Bywater
to
release
Pycelle,
and
been
rebuffed.
вЂњI
see.вЂќ

вЂњShe
insists
that
the
man
be
removed
from
his
office
and
placed
under
arrest
for
treason.
I
warn
youвЂ”вЂќ

He
set
aside
his
wine
cup.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
hear
no
warnings
from
you,
boy.вЂќ

вЂњSer,вЂќ
Lancel
said
stiffly.
He
touched
his
sword,
perhaps
to
remind
Tyrion
that
he
wore
one.
вЂњHave
a
care
how
you
speak
to
me,
Imp.вЂќ
Doubtless
he
meant
to
sound
threatening,
but
that
absurd
wisp
of
a
mustache
ruined
the
effect.

вЂњOh,
unhand
your
sword.
One
cry
from
me
and
Shagga
will
burst
in
and
kill
you.
With
an
axe,
not
a
wineskin.вЂќ

Lancel
reddened;
was
he
such
a
fool
as
to
believe
his
part
in
RobertвЂ™s
death
had
gone
unnoted?
вЂњI
am
a
knightвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSo
IвЂ™ve
noted.
Tell
meвЂ”did
Cersei
have
you
knighted
before
or
after
she
took
you
into
her
bed?вЂќ

The
flicker
in
LancelвЂ™s
green
eyes
was
all
the
admission
Tyrion
needed.
So
Varys
told
it
true.
Well,
no
one
can
ever
claim
that
my
sister
does
not
love
her
family.
вЂњWhat,
nothing
to
say?
No
more
warnings
for
me,
ser?вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
withdraw
these
filthy
accusations
orвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњPlease.
Have
you
given
any
thought
to
what
Joffrey
will
do
when
I
tell
him
you
murdered
his
father
to
bed
his
mother?вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
not
like
that!вЂќ
Lancel
protested,
horrified.

вЂњNo?
What
was
it
like,
pray?вЂќ

вЂњThe
queen
gave
me
the
strongwine!
Your
own
father
Lord
Tywin,
when
I
was
named
the
kingвЂ™s
squire,
he
told
me
to
obey
her
in
everything.вЂќ

вЂњDid
he
tell
you
to
fuck
her
too?вЂќ
Look
at
him.
Not
quite
so
tall,
his
features
not
so
fine,
and
his
hair
is
sand
instead
of
spun
gold,
yet
stillвЂ¦
even
a
poor
copy
of
Jaime
is
sweeter
than
an
empty
bed,
I
suppose.
вЂњNo,
I
thought
not.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
meantвЂ¦
I
only
did
as
I
was
bid,
IвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦hated
every
instant
of
it,
is
that
what
you
would
have
me
believe?
A
high
place
at
court,
knighthood,
my
sisterвЂ™s
legs
opening
for
you
at
night,
oh,
yes,
it
must
have
been
terrible
for
you.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
вЂњWait
here.
His
Grace
will
want
to
hear
this.вЂќ

The
defiance
went
from
Lancel
all
at
once.
The
young
knight
fell
to
his
knees
a
frightened
boy.
вЂњMercy,
my
lord,
I
beg
you.вЂќ

вЂњSave
it
for
Joffrey.
He
likes
a
good
beg.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord,
it
was
your
sisterвЂ™s
bidding,
the
queen,
as
you
said,
but
His
GraceвЂ¦
heвЂ™d
never
understandвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWould
you
have
me
keep
the
truth
from
the
king?вЂќ

вЂњFor
my
fatherвЂ™s
sake!
IвЂ™ll
leave
the
city,
it
will
be
as
if
it
never
happened!
I
swear,
I
will
end
itвЂ¦вЂќ

It
was
hard
not
to
laugh.
вЂњI
think
not.вЂќ

Now
the
lad
looked
lost.
вЂњMy
lord?вЂќ

вЂњYou
heard
me.
My
father
told
you
to
obey
my
sister?
Very
well,
obey
her.
Stay
close
to
her
side,
keep
her
trust,
pleasure
her
as
often
as
she
requires
it.
No
one
need
ever
knowвЂ¦
so
long
as
you
keep
faith
with
me.
I
want
to
know
what
Cersei
is
doing.
Where
she
goes,
who
she
sees,
what
they
talk
of,
what
plans
she
is
hatching.
All.
And
you
will
be
the
one
to
tell
me,
wonвЂ™t
you?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lord.вЂќ
Lancel
spoke
without
a
momentвЂ™s
hesitation.
Tyrion
liked
that.
вЂњI
will.
I
swear
it.
As
you
command.вЂќ

вЂњRise.вЂќ
Tyrion
filled
the
second
cup
and
pressed
it
on
him.
вЂњDrink
to
our
understanding.
I
promise,
there
are
no
boars
in
the
castle
that
I
know
of.вЂќ
Lancel
lifted
the
cup
and
drank,
albeit
stiffly.
вЂњSmile,
cousin.
My
sister
is
a
beautiful
woman,
and
itвЂ™s
all
for
the
good
of
the
realm.
You
could
do
well
out
of
this.
Knighthood
is
nothing.
If
youвЂ™re
clever,
youвЂ™ll
have
a
lordship
from
me
before
youвЂ™re
done.вЂќ
Tyrion
swirled
the
wine
in
his
cup.
вЂњWe
want
Cersei
to
have
every
faith
in
you.
Go
back
and
tell
her
I
beg
her
forgiveness.
Tell
her
that
you
frightened
me,
that
I
want
no
conflict
between
us,
that
henceforth
I
shall
do
nothing
without
her
consent.вЂќ

вЂњButвЂ¦
her
demandsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOh,
IвЂ™ll
give
her
Pycelle.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will?вЂќ
Lancel
seemed
astonished.

Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
release
him
on
the
morrow.
I
could
swear
that
I
hadnвЂ™t
harmed
a
hair
on
his
head,
but
it
wouldnвЂ™t
be
strictly
true.
In
any
case,
heвЂ™s
well
enough,
though
I
wonвЂ™t
vouch
for
his
vigor.
The
black
cells
are
not
a
healthy
place
for
a
man
his
age.
Cersei
can
keep
him
as
a
pet
or
send
him
to
the
Wall,
I
donвЂ™t
care
which,
but
I
wonвЂ™t
have
him
on
the
council.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Ser
Jacelyn?вЂќ

вЂњTell
my
sister
you
believe
you
can
win
him
away
from
me,
given
time.
That
ought
to
content
her
for
a
while.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.вЂќ
Lancel
finished
his
wine.

вЂњOne
last
thing.
With
King
Robert
dead,
it
would
be
most
embarrassing
should
his
grieving
widow
suddenly
grow
great
with
child.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord,
IвЂ¦
weвЂ¦
the
queen
has
commanded
me
not
toвЂ¦вЂќ
His
ears
had
turned
Lannister
crimson.
вЂњI
spill
my
seed
on
her
belly,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњA
lovely
belly,
I
have
no
doubt.
Moisten
it
as
often
as
you
wishвЂ¦
but
see
that
your
dew
falls
nowhere
else.
I
want
no
more
nephews,
is
that
clear?вЂќ

Ser
Lancel
made
a
stiff
bow
and
took
his
leave.

Tyrion
allowed
himself
a
moment
to
feel
sorry
for
the
boy.
Another
fool,
and
a
weakling
as
well,
but
he
does
not
deserve
what
Cersei
and
I
are
doing
to
him.
It
was
a
kindness
that
his
uncle
Kevan
had
two
other
sons;
this
one
was
unlikely
to
live
out
the
year.
Cersei
would
have
him
killed
out
of
hand
if
she
learned
he
was
betraying
her,
and
if
by
some
grace
of
the
gods
she
did
not,
Lancel
would
never
survive
the
day
Jaime
Lannister
returned
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
The
only
question
would
be
whether
Jaime
cut
him
down
in
a
jealous
rage,
or
Cersei
murdered
him
first
to
keep
Jaime
from
finding
out.
TyrionвЂ™s
silver
was
on
Cersei.

A
restlessness
was
on
him,
and
Tyrion
knew
full
well
he
would
not
get
back
to
sleep
tonight.
Not
here,
in
any
case.
He
found
Podrick
Payne
asleep
in
a
chair
outside
the
door
of
the
solar,
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder.
вЂњSummon
Bronn,
and
then
run
down
to
the
stables
and
have
two
horses
saddled.вЂќ

The
squireвЂ™s
eyes
were
cloudy
with
sleep.
вЂњHorses.вЂќ

вЂњThose
big
brown
animals
that
love
apples,
IвЂ™m
sure
youвЂ™ve
seen
them.
Four
legs
and
a
tail.
But
Bronn
first.вЂќ

The
sellsword
was
not
long
in
appearing.
вЂњWho
pissed
in
your
soup?вЂќ
he
demanded.

вЂњCersei,
as
ever.
YouвЂ™d
think
IвЂ™d
be
used
to
the
taste
by
now,
but
never
mind.
My
gentle
sister
seems
to
have
mistaken
me
for
Ned
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњI
hear
he
was
taller.вЂќ

вЂњNot
after
Joff
took
off
his
head.
You
ought
to
have
dressed
more
warmly,
the
night
is
chill.вЂќ

вЂњAre
we
going
somewhere?вЂќ

вЂњAre
all
sellswords
as
clever
as
you?вЂќ

The
city
streets
were
dangerous,
but
with
Bronn
beside
him
Tyrion
felt
safe
enough.
The
guards
let
him
out
a
postern
gate
in
the
north
wall,
and
they
rode
down
Shadowblack
Lane
to
the
foot
of
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill,
and
thence
onto
Pigrun
Alley,
past
rows
of
shuttered
windows
and
tall
timber-and-stone
buildings
whose
upper
stories
leaned
out
so
far
over
the
street
they
almost
kissed.
The
moon
seemed
to
follow
them
as
they
went,
playing
peek-and-sneak
among
the
chimneys.
They
encountered
no
one
but
a
lone
old
crone,
carrying
a
dead
cat
by
the
tail.
She
gave
them
a
fearful
look,
as
if
she
were
afraid
they
might
try
to
steal
her
dinner,
and
slunk
off
into
the
shadows
without
a
word.

Tyrion
reflected
on
the
men
who
had
been
Hand
before
him,
who
had
proved
no
match
for
his
sisterвЂ™s
wiles.
How
could
they
be?
Men
like
thatвЂ¦
too
honest
to
live,
too
noble
to
shit,
Cersei
devours
such
fools
every
morning
when
she
breaks
her
fast.
The
only
way
to
defeat
my
sister
is
to
play
her
own
game,
and
that
was
something
the
Lords
Stark
and
Arryn
would
never
do.
Small
wonder
that
both
of
them
were
dead,
while
Tyrion
Lannister
had
never
felt
more
alive.
His
stunted
legs
might
make
him
a
comic
grotesque
at
a
harvest
ball,
but
this
dance
he
knew.

Despite
the
hour,
the
brothel
was
crowded.
Chataya
greeted
them
pleasantly
and
escorted
them
to
the
common
room.
Bronn
went
upstairs
with
a
dark-eyed
girl
from
Dorne,
but
Alayaya
was
busy
entertaining.
вЂњShe
will
be
so
pleased
to
know
youвЂ™ve
come,вЂќ
said
Chataya.
вЂњI
will
see
that
the
turret
room
is
made
ready
for
you.
Will
my
lord
take
a
cup
of
wine
while
he
waits?вЂќ

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
he
said.

The
wine
was
poor
stuff
compared
to
the
vintages
from
the
Arbor
the
house
normally
served.
вЂњYou
must
forgive
us,
my
lord,вЂќ
Chataya
said.
вЂњI
cannot
find
good
wine
at
any
price
of
late.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
not
alone
in
that,
I
fear.вЂќ

Chataya
commiserated
with
him
a
moment,
then
excused
herself
and
glided
off.
A
handsome
woman,
Tyrion
reflected
as
he
watched
her
go.
He
had
seldom
seen
such
elegance
and
dignity
in
a
whore.
Though
to
be
sure,
she
saw
herself
more
as
a
kind
of
priestess.
Perhaps
that
is
the
secret.
It
is
not
what
we
do,
so
much
as
why
we
do
it.
Somehow
that
thought
comforted
him.

A
few
of
the
other
patrons
were
giving
him
sideways
looks.
The
last
time
he
ventured
out,
a
man
had
spit
on
himвЂ¦
well,
had
tried
to.
Instead
heвЂ™d
spit
on
Bronn,
and
in
future
would
do
his
spitting
without
teeth.

вЂњIs
milord
feeling
unloved?вЂќ
Dancy
slid
into
his
lap
and
nibbled
at
his
ear.
вЂњI
have
a
cure
for
that.вЂќ

Smiling,
Tyrion
shook
his
head.
вЂњYou
are
too
beautiful
for
words,
sweetling,
but
IвЂ™ve
grown
fond
of
AlayayaвЂ™s
remedy.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ve
never
tried
mine.
Milord
never
chooses
anyone
but
вЂ™Yaya.
SheвЂ™s
good
but
IвЂ™m
better,
donвЂ™t
you
want
to
see?вЂќ

вЂњNext
time,
perhaps.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
no
doubt
that
Dancy
would
be
a
lively
handful.
She
was
pug-nosed
and
bouncy,
with
freckles
and
a
mane
of
thick
red
hair
that
tumbled
down
past
her
waist.
But
he
had
Shae
waiting
for
him
at
the
manse.

Giggling,
she
put
her
hand
between
his
thighs
and
squeezed
him
through
his
breeches.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
think
he
wants
to
wait
till
next
time,вЂќ
she
announced.
вЂњHe
wants
to
come
out
and
count
all
my
freckles,
I
think.вЂќ

вЂњDancy.вЂќ
Alayaya
stood
in
the
doorway,
dark
and
cool
in
gauzy
green
silk.
вЂњHis
lordship
is
come
to
visit
me.вЂќ

Tyrion
gently
disentangled
himself
from
the
other
girl
and
stood.
Dancy
did
not
seem
to
mind.
вЂњNext
time,вЂќ
she
reminded
him.
She
put
a
finger
in
her
mouth
and
sucked
it.

As
the
black-skinned
girl
led
him
up
the
stairs,
she
said,
вЂњPoor
Dancy.
She
has
a
fortnight
to
get
my
lord
to
choose
her.
Elsewise
she
loses
her
black
pearls
to
Marei.вЂќ

Marei
was
a
cool,
pale,
delicate
girl
Tyrion
had
noticed
once
or
twice.
Green
eyes
and
porcelain
skin,
long
straight
silvery
hair,
very
lovely,
but
too
solemn
by
half.
вЂњIвЂ™d
hate
to
have
the
poor
child
lose
her
pearls
on
account
of
me.вЂќ

вЂњThen
take
her
upstairs
next
time.вЂќ

вЂњMaybe
I
will.вЂќ

She
smiled.
вЂњI
think
not,
my
lord.вЂќ

SheвЂ™s
right,
Tyrion
thought,
I
wonвЂ™t.
Shae
may
be
only
a
whore,
but
I
am
faithful
to
her
after
my
fashion.

In
the
turret
room,
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
wardrobe,
he
looked
at
Alayaya
curiously.
вЂњWhat
do
you
do
while
IвЂ™m
gone?вЂќ

She
raised
her
arms
and
stretched
like
some
sleek
black
cat.
вЂњSleep.
I
am
much
better
rested
since
you
began
to
visit
us,
my
lord.
And
Marei
is
teaching
us
to
read,
perhaps
soon
I
will
be
able
to
pass
the
time
with
a
book.вЂќ

вЂњSleep
is
good,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњAnd
books
are
better.вЂќ
He
gave
her
a
quick
kiss
on
the
cheek.
Then
it
was
down
the
shaft
and
through
the
tunnel.

As
he
left
the
stable
on
his
piebald
gelding,
Tyrion
heard
the
sound
of
music
drifting
over
the
rooftops.
It
was
pleasant
to
think
that
men
still
sang,
even
in
the
midst
of
butchery
and
famine.
Remembered
notes
filled
his
head,
and
for
a
moment
he
could
almost
hear
Tysha
as
sheвЂ™d
sung
to
him
half
a
lifetime
ago.
He
reined
up
to
listen.
The
tune
was
wrong,
the
words
too
faint
to
hear.
A
different
song
then,
and
why
not?
His
sweet
innocent
Tysha
had
been
a
lie
start
to
finish,
only
a
whore
his
brother
Jaime
had
hired
to
make
him
a
man.

IвЂ™m
free
of
Tysha
now,
he
thought.
SheвЂ™s
haunted
me
half
my
life,
but
I
donвЂ™t
need
her
anymore,
no
more
than
I
need
Alayaya
or
Dancy
or
Marei,
or
the
hundreds
like
them
IвЂ™ve
bedded
with
over
the
years.
I
have
Shae
now.
Shae.

The
gates
of
the
manse
were
closed
and
barred.
Tyrion
pounded
until
the
ornate
bronze
eye
clacked
open.
вЂњItвЂ™s
me.вЂќ
The
man
who
admitted
him
was
one
of
VarysвЂ™s
prettier
finds,
a
Braavosi
daggerman
with
a
harelip
and
a
lazy
eye.
Tyrion
had
wanted
no
handsome
young
guardsmen
loitering
about
Shae
day
after
day.
вЂњFind
me
old,
ugly,
scarred
men,
preferably
impotent,вЂќ
he
had
told
the
eunuch.
вЂњMen
who
prefer
boys.
Or
men
who
prefer
sheep,
for
that
matter.вЂќ
Varys
had
not
managed
to
come
up
with
any
sheeplovers,
but
he
did
find
a
eunuch
strangler
and
a
pair
of
foulsmelling
Ibbenese
who
were
as
fond
of
axes
as
they
were
of
each
other.
The
others
were
as
choice
a
lot
of
mercenaries
as
ever
graced
a
dungeon,
each
uglier
than
the
last.
When
Varys
had
paraded
them
before
him,
Tyrion
had
been
afraid
heвЂ™d
gone
too
far,
but
Shae
had
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint.
And
why
would
she?
She
has
never
complained
of
me,
and
IвЂ™m
more
hideous
than
all
her
guards
together.
Perhaps
she
does
not
even
see
ugliness.

Even
so,
Tyrion
would
sooner
have
used
some
of
his
mountain
clansmen
to
guard
the
manse;
ChellaвЂ™s
Black
Ears
perhaps,
or
the
Moon
Brothers.
He
had
more
faith
in
their
iron
loyalties
and
sense
of
honor
than
in
the
greed
of
sellswords.
The
risk
was
too
great,
however.
All
KingвЂ™s
Landing
knew
the
wildlings
were
his.
If
he
sent
the
Black
Ears
here,
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
until
the
whole
city
knew
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand
was
keeping
a
concubine.

One
of
the
Ibbenese
took
his
horse.
вЂњHave
you
woken
her?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked
him.

вЂњNo,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

вЂњGood.вЂќ

The
fire
in
the
bedchamber
had
burned
down
to
embers,
but
the
room
was
still
warm.
Shae
had
kicked
off
her
blankets
and
sheets
as
she
slept.
She
lay
nude
atop
the
featherbed,
the
soft
curves
of
her
young
body
limned
in
the
faint
glow
from
the
hearth.
Tyrion
stood
in
the
door
and
drank
in
the
sight
of
her.
Younger
than
Marei,
sweeter
than
Dancy,
more
beautiful
than
Alayaya,
sheвЂ™s
all
I
need
and
more.
How
could
a
whore
look
so
clean
and
sweet
and
innocent,
he
wondered?

He
had
not
intended
to
disturb
her,
but
the
sight
of
her
was
enough
to
make
him
hard.
He
let
his
garments
fall
to
the
floor,
then
crawled
onto
the
bed
and
gently
pushed
her
legs
apart
and
kissed
her
between
the
thighs.
Shae
murmured
in
her
sleep.
He
kissed
her
again,
and
licked
at
her
secret
sweetness,
on
and
on
until
his
beard
and
her
cunt
were
both
soaked.
When
she
gave
a
soft
moan
and
shuddered,
he
climbed
up
and
thrust
himself
inside
her
and
exploded
almost
at
once.

Her
eyes
were
open.
She
smiled
and
stroked
his
head
and
whispered,
вЂњI
just
had
the
sweetest
dream,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

Tyrion
nipped
at
her
small
hard
nipple
and
nestled
his
head
on
her
shoulder.
He
did
not
pull
out
of
her;
would
that
he
never
had
to
pull
out
of
her.
вЂњThis
is
no
dream,вЂќ
he
promised
her.
It
is
real,
all
of
it,
he
thought,
the
wars,
the
intrigues,
the
great
bloody
game,
and
me
in
the
center
of
itвЂ¦
me,
the
dwarf,
the
monster,
the
one
they
scorned
and
laughed
at,
but
now
I
hold
it
all,
the
power,
the
city,
the
girl.
This
was
what
I
was
made
for,
and
gods
forgive
me,
but
I
do
love
itвЂ¦

And
her.
And
her.





ARYA

Whatever
names
Harren
the
Black
had
meant
to
give
his
towers
were
long
forgotten.
They
were
called
the
Tower
of
Dread,
the
WidowвЂ™s
Tower,
the
Wailing
Tower,
the
Tower
of
Ghosts,
and
Kingspyre
Tower.
Arya
slept
in
a
shallow
niche
in
the
cavernous
vaults
beneath
the
Wailing
Tower,
on
a
bed
of
straw.
She
had
water
to
wash
in
whenever
she
liked,
a
chunk
of
soap.
The
work
was
hard,
but
no
harder
than
walking
miles
every
day.
Weasel
did
not
need
to
find
worms
and
bugs
to
eat,
as
Arry
had;
there
was
bread
every
day,
and
barley
stews
with
bits
of
carrot
and
turnip,
and
once
a
fortnight
even
a
bite
of
meat.

Hot
Pie
ate
even
better;
he
was
where
he
belonged,
in
the
kitchens,
a
round
stone
building
with
a
domed
roof
that
was
a
world
unto
itself.
Arya
took
her
meals
at
a
trestle
table
in
the
undercroft
with
Weese
and
his
other
charges,
but
sometimes
she
would
be
chosen
to
help
fetch
their
food,
and
she
and
Hot
Pie
could
steal
a
moment
to
talk.
He
could
never
remember
that
she
was
now
Weasel
and
kept
calling
her
Arry,
even
though
he
knew
she
was
a
girl.
Once
he
tried
to
slip
her
a
hot
apple
tart,
but
he
made
such
a
clumsy
job
of
it
that
two
of
the
cooks
saw.
They
took
the
tart
away
and
beat
him
with
a
big
wooden
spoon.

Gendry
had
been
sent
to
the
forge;
Arya
seldom
saw
him.
As
for
those
she
served
with,
she
did
not
even
want
to
know
their
names.
That
only
made
it
hurt
worse
when
they
died.
Most
of
them
were
older
than
she
was
and
content
to
let
her
alone.

Harrenhal
was
vast,
much
of
it
far
gone
in
decay.
Lady
Whent
had
held
the
castle
as
bannerman
to
House
Tully,
but
sheвЂ™d
used
only
the
lower
thirds
of
two
of
the
five
towers,
and
let
the
rest
go
to
ruin.
Now
she
was
fled,
and
the
small
household
sheвЂ™d
left
could
not
begin
to
tend
the
needs
of
all
the
knights,
lords,
and
highborn
prisoners
Lord
Tywin
had
brought,
so
the
Lannisters
must
forage
for
servants
as
well
as
for
plunder
and
provender.
The
talk
was
that
Lord
Tywin
planned
to
restore
Harrenhal
to
glory,
and
make
it
his
new
seat
once
the
war
was
done.

Weese
used
Arya
to
run
messages,
draw
water,
and
fetch
food,
and
sometimes
to
serve
at
table
in
the
Barracks
Hall
above
the
armory,
where
the
men-at-arms
took
their
meals.
But
most
of
her
work
was
cleaning.
The
ground
floor
of
the
Wailing
Tower
was
given
over
to
storerooms
and
granaries,
and
two
floors
above
housed
part
of
the
garrison,
but
the
upper
stories
had
not
been
occupied
for
eighty
years.
Now
Lord
Tywin
had
commanded
that
they
be
made
fit
for
habitation
again.
There
were
floors
to
be
scrubbed,
grime
to
be
washed
off
windows,
broken
chairs
and
rotted
beds
to
be
carried
off.
The
topmost
story
was
infested
with
nests
of
the
huge
black
bats
that
House
Whent
had
used
for
its
sigil,
and
there
were
rats
in
the
cellars
as
wellвЂ¦
and
ghosts,
some
said,
the
spirits
of
Harren
the
Black
and
his
sons.

Arya
thought
that
was
stupid.
Harren
and
his
sons
had
died
in
Kingspyre
Tower,
that
was
why
it
had
that
name,
so
why
should
they
cross
the
yard
to
haunt
her?
The
Wailing
Tower
only
wailed
when
the
wind
blew
from
the
north,
and
that
was
just
the
sound
the
air
made
blowing
through
the
cracks
in
the
stones
where
they
had
fissured
from
the
heat.
if
there
were
ghosts
in
Harrenhal,
they
never
troubled
her.
It
was
the
living
men
she
feared,
Weese
and
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
and
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
himself,
who
kept
his
apartments
in
Kingspyre
Tower,
still
the
tallest
and
mightiest
of
all,
though
lopsided
beneath
the
weight
of
the
slagged
stone
that
made
it
look
like
some
giant
half-melted
black
candle.

She
wondered
what
Lord
Tywin
would
do
if
she
marched
up
to
him
and
confessed
to
being
Arya
Stark,
but
she
knew
sheвЂ™d
never
get
near
enough
to
talk
to
him,
and
anyhow
heвЂ™d
never
believe
her
if
she
did,
and
afterward
Weese
would
beat
her
bloody.

In
his
own
small
strutting
way,
Weese
was
nearly
as
scary
as
Ser
Gregor.
The
Mountain
swatted
men
like
flies,
but
most
of
the
time
he
did
not
even
seem
to
know
the
fly
was
there.
Weese
always
knew
you
were
there,
and
what
you
were
doing,
and
sometimes
what
you
were
thinking.
He
would
hit
at
the
slightest
provocation,
and
he
had
a
dog
who
was
near
as
bad
as
he
was,
an
ugly
spotted
bitch
that
smelled
worse
than
any
dog
Arya
had
ever
known.
Once
she
saw
him
set
the
dog
on
a
latrine
boy
whoвЂ™d
annoyed
him.
She
tore
a
big
chunk
out
of
the
boyвЂ™s
calf
while
Weese
laughed.

It
took
him
only
three
days
to
earn
the
place
of
honor
in
her
nightly
prayers.
вЂњWeese,вЂќ
she
would
whisper,
first
of
all.
вЂњDunsen,
Chiswyck,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.вЂќ
If
she
let
herself
forget
even
one
of
them,
how
would
she
ever
find
him
again
to
kill
him?

On
the
road
Arya
had
felt
like
a
sheep,
but
Harrenbal
turned
her
into
a
mouse.
She
was
grey
as
a
mouse
in
her
scratchy
wool
shift,
and
like
a
mouse
she
kept
to
the
crannies
and
crevices
and
dark
holes
of
the
castle,
scurrying
out
of
the
way
of
the
mighty.

Sometimes
she
thought
they
were
all
mice
within
those
thick
walls,
even
the
knights
and
the
great
lords.
The
size
of
the
castle
made
even
Gregor
Clegane
seem
small.
Harrenhal
covered
thrice
as
much
ground
as
Winterfell,
and
its
buildings
were
so
much
larger
they
could
scarcely
be
compared.
Its
stables
housed
a
thousand
horses,
its
godswood
covered
twenty
acres,
its
kitchens
were
as
large
as
WinterfellвЂ™s
Great
Hall,
and
its
own
great
hall,
grandly
named
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths
even
though
it
only
had
thirty
and
some
(Arya
had
tried
to
count
them,
twice,
but
she
came
up
with
thirty-three
once
and
thirty-five
the
other
time)
was
so
cavernous
that
Lord
Tywin
could
have
feasted
his
entire
host,
though
he
never
did.
Walls,
doors,
halls,
steps,
everything
was
built
to
an
inhuman
scale
that
made
Arya
remember
the
stories
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
of
the
giants
who
lived
beyond
the
Wall.

And
as
lords
and
ladies
never
notice
the
little
grey
mice
under
their
feet,
Arya
heard
all
sorts
of
secrets
just
by
keeping
her
ears
open
as
she
went
about
her
duties.
Pretty
Pia
from
the
buttery
was
a
slut
who
was
working
her
way
through
every
knight
in
the
castle.
The
wife
of
the
gaoler
was
with
child,
but
the
real
father
was
either
Ser
Alyn
Stackspear
or
a
singer
called
Whitesmile
Wat.
Lord
Lefford
made
mock
of
ghosts
at
table,
but
always
kept
a
candle
burning
by
his
bed.
Ser
DunaverвЂ™s
squire
Jodge
could
not
hold
his
water
when
he
slept.
The
cooks
despised
Ser
Harys
Swyft
and
spit
in
all
his
food.
once
she
even
overheard
Maester
TothmureвЂ™s
serving
girl
confiding
to
her
brother
about
some
message
that
said
Joffrey
was
a
bastard
and
not
the
rightful
king
at
all.
вЂњLord
Tywin
told
him
to
burn
the
letter
and
never
speak
such
filth
again,вЂќ
the
girl
whispered.

King
RobertвЂ™s
brothers
Stannis
and
Renly
had
joined
the
fighting,
she
heard.
вЂњAnd
both
of
them
kings
now,вЂќ
Weese
said.
вЂњRealmвЂ™s
got
more
kings
than
a
castleвЂ™s
got
rats.вЂќ
Even
Lannister
men
questioned
how
long
Joffrey
would
hold
the
Iron
Throne.
вЂњThe
ladвЂ™s
got
no
army
but
them
gold
cloaks,
and
heвЂ™s
ruled
by
a
eunuch,
a
dwarf,
and
a
woman,вЂќ
she
heard
a
lordling
mutter
in
his
cups.
вЂњWhat
good
will
the
likes
of
them
be
if
it
comes
to
battle?вЂќ
There
was
always
talk
of
Beric
Dondarrion.
A
fat
archer
once
said
the
Bloody
Mummers
had
slain
him,
but
the
others
only
laughed.
вЂњLorch
killed
the
man
at
Rushing
Falls,
and
the
MountainвЂ™s
slain
him
twice.
Got
me
a
silver
stag
says
he
donвЂ™t
stay
dead
this
time
neither.вЂќ

Arya
did
not
know
who
Bloody
Mummers
were
until
a
fortnight
later,
when
the
queerest
company
of
men
sheвЂ™d
ever
seen
arrived
at
Harrenhal.
Beneath
the
standard
of
a
black
goat
with
bloody
horns
rode
copper
men
with
bells
in
their
braids;
lancers
astride
striped
black-and-white
horses;
bowmen
with
powdered
cheeks;
squat
hairy
men
with
shaggy
shields;
brown-skinned
men
in
feathered
cloaks;
a
wispy
fool
in
green-and-pink
motley;
swordsmen
with
fantastic
forked
beards
dyed
green
and
purple
and
silver;
spearmen
with
colored
scars
that
covered
their
cheeks;
a
slender
man
in
septonвЂ™s
robes,
a
fatherly
one
in
maesterвЂ™s
grey,
and
a
sickly
one
whose
leather
cloak
was
fringed
with
long
blond
hair.

At
their
head
was
a
man
stick-thin
and
very
tall,
with
a
drawn
emaciated
face
made
even
longer
by
the
ropy
black
beard
that
grew
from
his
pointed
chin
nearly
to
his
waist.
The
helm
that
hung
from
his
saddle
horn
was
black
steel,
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
a
goatвЂ™s
head.
About
his
neck
he
wore
a
chain
made
of
linked
coins
of
many
different
sizes,
shapes,
and
metals,
and
his
horse
was
one
of
the
strange
black-and-white
ones.

вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
want
to
know
that
lot,
Weasel,вЂќ
Weese
said
when
he
saw
her
looking
at
the
goat-helmed
man.
Two
of
his
drinking
friends
were
with
him,
men-at-arms
in
service
to
Lord
Lefford.

вЂњWho
are
they?вЂќ
she
asked.

One
of
the
soldiers
laughed.
вЂњThe
Footmen,
girl.
Toes
of
the
Goat.
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
Bloody
Mummers.вЂќ

вЂњPease
for
wits.
You
get
her
flayed,
you
can
scrub
the
bloody
steps,вЂќ
said
Weese.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
sellswords,
Weasel
girl.
Call
themselves
the
Brave
Companions.
DonвЂ™t
use
them
other
names
where
they
can
hear,
or
theyвЂ™ll
hurt
you
bad.
The
goat-helmвЂ™s
their
captain,
Lord
Vargo
Hoat.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
no
fucking
lord,вЂќ
said
the
second
soldier.
вЂњI
heard
Ser
Amory
say
so.
HeвЂ™s
just
some
sellsword
with
a
mouth
full
of
slobber
and
a
high
opinion
of
hisself.вЂќ

вЂњAye,вЂќ
said
Weese,
вЂњbut
she
better
call
him
lord
if
she
wants
to
keep
all
her
parts.вЂќ

Arya
looked
at
Vargo
Hoat
again.
How
many
monsters
does
Lord
Tywin
have?

The
Brave
Companions
were
housed
in
the
WidowвЂ™s
Tower,
so
Arya
need
not
serve
them.
She
was
glad
of
that;
on
the
very
night
they
arrived,
fighting
broke
out
between
the
sellswords
and
some
Lannister
men.
Ser
Harys
SwyftвЂ™s
squire
was
stabbed
to
death
and
two
of
the
Bloody
Mummers
were
wounded.
The
next
morning
Lord
Tywin
hanged
them
both
from
the
gatehouse
walls,
along
with
one
of
Lord
LyddenвЂ™s
archers.
Weese
said
the
archer
had
started
all
the
trouble
by
taunting
the
sellswords
over
Beric
Dondarrion.
After
the
hanged
men
had
stopped
kicking,
Vargo
Hoat
and
Ser
Harys
embraced
and
kissed
and
swore
to
love
each
other
always
as
Lord
Tywin
looked
on.
Arya
thought
it
was
funny
the
way
Vargo
Hoat
lisped
and
slobbered,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
laugh.

The
Bloody
Mummers
did
not
linger
long
at
Harrenhal,
but
before
they
rode
out
again,
Arya
heard
one
of
them
saying
how
a
northern
army
under
Roose
Bolton
had
occupied
the
ruby
ford
of
the
Trident.
вЂњIf
he
crosses,
Lord
Tywin
will
smash
him
again
like
he
did
on
the
Green
Fork,вЂќ
a
Lannister
bowmen
said,
but
his
fellows
jeered
him
down.
вЂњBoltonвЂ™ll
never
cross,
not
till
the
Young
Wolf
marches
from
Riverrun
with
his
wild
northmen
and
all
them
wolves.вЂќ

Arya
had
not
known
her
brother
was
so
near.
Riverrun
was
much
closer
than
Winterfell,
though
she
was
not
certain
where
it
lay
in
relation
to
Harrenhal.
I
could
find
out
somehow,
I
know
I
could,
if
only
I
could
get
away.
When
she
thought
of
seeing
RobbвЂ™s
face
again
Arya
had
to
bite
her
lip.
And
I
want
to
see
Jon
too,
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
and
Mother.
Even
SansaвЂ¦
IвЂ™ll
kiss
her
and
beg
her
pardons
like
a
proper
lady,
sheвЂ™ll
like
that.

From
the
courtyard
talk
sheвЂ™d
learned
that
the
upper
chambers
of
the
Tower
of
Dread
housed
three
dozen
captives
taken
during
some
battle
on
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Most
had
been
given
freedom
of
the
castle
in
return
for
their
pledge
not
to
attempt
escape.
They
vowed
not
to
escape,
Arya
told
herself,
but
they
never
swore
not
to
help
me
escape.

The
captives
ate
at
their
own
table
in
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths,
and
could
often
be
seen
about
the
grounds.
Four
brothers
took
their
exercise
together
every
day,
fighting
with
staves
and
wooden
shields
in
the
Flowstone
Yard.
Three
of
them
were
Freys
of
the
Crossing,
the
fourth
their
bastard
brother.
They
were
only
there
a
short
time,
though;
one
morning
two
other
brothers
arrived
under
a
peace
banner
with
a
chest
of
gold,
and
ransomed
them
from
the
knights
whoвЂ™d
captured
them.
The
six
Freys
all
left
together.

No
one
ransomed
the
northmen,
though.
One
fat
lordling
haunted
the
kitchens,
Hot
Pie
told
her,
always
looking
for
a
morsel.
His
mustache
was
so
bushy
that
it
covered
his
mouth,
and
the
clasp
that
held
his
cloak
was
a
silver-and-sapphire
trident.
He
belonged
to
Lord
Tywin,
but
the
fierce,
bearded
young
man
who
liked
to
walk
the
battlements
alone
in
a
black
cloak
patterned
with
white
suns
had
been
taken
by
some
hedge
knight
who
meant
to
get
rich
off
him.
Sansa
would
have
known
who
he
was,
and
the
fat
one
too,
but
Arya
had
never
taken
much
interest
in
titles
and
sigils.
Whenever
Septa
Mordane
had
gone
on
about
the
history
of
this
house
and
that
house,
she
was
inclined
to
drift
and
dream
and
wonder
when
the
lesson
would
be
done.

She
did
remember
Lord
Cerwyn,
though.
His
lands
had
been
close
to
Winterfell,
so
he
and
his
son
Cley
had
often
visited.
Yet
as
fate
would
have
it,
he
was
the
only
captive
who
was
never
seen;
he
was
abed
in
a
tower
cell,
recovering
from
a
wound.
For
days
and
days
Arya
tried
to
work
out
how
she
might
steal
past
the
door
guards
to
see
him.
If
he
knew
her,
he
would
be
honor
bound
to
help
her.
A
lord
would
have
gold
for
a
certainty,
they
all
did;
perhaps
he
would
pay
some
of
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
own
sellswords
to
take
her
to
Riverrun.
Father
had
always
said
that
most
sellswords
would
betray
anyone
for
enough
gold.

Then
one
morning
she
spied
three
women
in
the
cowled
grey
robes
of
the
silent
sisters
loading
a
corpse
into
their
wagon.
The
body
was
sewn
into
a
cloak
of
the
finest
silk,
decorated
with
a
battle-axe
sigil.
When
Arya
asked
who
it
was,
one
of
the
guards
told
her
that
Lord
Cerwyn
had
died.
The
words
felt
like
a
kick
in
the
belly.
He
could
never
have
helped
you
anyway,
she
thought
as
the
sisters
drove
the
wagon
through
the
gate.
He
couldnвЂ™t
even
help
himself,
you
stupid
mouse.

After
that
it
was
back
to
scrubbing
and
scurrying
and
listening
at
doors.
Lord
Tywin
would
soon
march
on
Riverrun,
she
heard.
or
he
would
drive
south
to
Highgarden,
no
one
would
ever
expect
that.
No,
he
must
defend
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
Stannis
was
the
greatest
threat.
HeвЂ™d
sent
Gregor
Clegane
and
Vargo
Hoat
to
destroy
Roose
Bolton
and
remove
the
dagger
from
his
back.
HeвЂ™d
sent
ravens
to
the
Eyrie,
he
meant
to
wed
the
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
and
win
the
Vale.
HeвЂ™d
bought
a
ton
of
silver
to
forge
magic
swords
that
would
slay
the
Stark
wargs.
He
was
writing
Lady
Stark
to
make
a
peace,
the
Kingslayer
would
soon
be
freed.

Though
ravens
came
and
went
every
day,
Lord
Tywin
himself
spent
most
of
his
days
behind
closed
doors
with
his
war
council.
Arya
caught
glimpses
of
him,
but
always
from
afarвЂ”once
walking
the
walls
in
the
company
of
three
maesters
and
the
fat
captive
with
the
bushy
mustache,
once
riding
out
with
his
lords
bannermen
to
visit
the
encampments,
but
most
often
standing
in
an
arch
of
the
covered
gallery
watching
men
at
practice
in
the
yard
below.
He
stood
with
his
hands
locked
together
on
the
gold
pommel
of
his
longsword.
They
said
Lord
Tywin
loved
gold
most
of
all;
he
even
shit
gold,
she
heard
one
squire
jest.
The
Lannister
lord
was
strong-looking
for
an
old
man,
with
stiff
golden
whiskers
and
a
bald
head.
There
was
something
in
his
face
that
reminded
Arya
of
her
own
father,
even
though
they
looked
nothing
alike.
He
has
a
lordвЂ™s
face,
thatвЂ™s
all,
she
told
herself.
She
remembered
hearing
her
lady
mother
tell
Father
to
put
on
his
lordвЂ™s
face
and
go
deal
with
some
matter.
Father
had
laughed
at
that.
She
could
not
imagine
Lord
Tywin
ever
laughing
at
anything.

One
afternoon,
while
she
was
waiting
her
turn
to
draw
a
pail
of
water
from
the
well,
she
heard
the
hinges
of
the
east
gate
groaning.
A
party
of
men
rode
under
the
portcullis
at
a
walk.
When
she
spied
the
manticore
crawling
across
the
shield
of
their
leader,
a
stab
of
hate
shot
through
her.

In
the
light
of
day,
Ser
Amory
Lorch
looked
less
frightening
than
he
had
by
torchlight,
but
he
still
had
the
pigвЂ™s
eyes
she
recalled.
One
of
the
women
said
that
his
men
had
ridden
all
the
way
around
the
lake
chasing
Beric
Dondarrion
and
slaying
rebels.
We
werenвЂ™t
rebels,
Arya
thought.
We
were
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch;
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
takes
no
side.
Ser
Amory
had
fewer
men
than
she
remembered,
though,
and
many
wounded.
I
hope
their
wounds
fester.
I
hope
they
all
die.

Then
she
saw
the
three
near
the
end
of
the
column.

Rorge
had
donned
a
black
halfhelm
with
a
broad
iron
nasal
that
made
it
hard
to
see
that
he
did
not
have
a
nose.
Biter
rode
ponderously
beside
him
on
a
destrier
that
looked
ready
to
collapse
under
his
weight.
Half-healed
burns
covered
his
body,
making
him
even
more
hideous
than
before.

But
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
still
smiled.
His
garb
was
still
ragged
and
filthy,
but
he
had
found
time
to
wash
and
brush
his
hair.
It
streamed
down
across
his
shoulders,
red
and
white
and
shiny,
and
Arya
heard
the
girls
giggling
to
each
other
in
admiration.

I
should
have
let
the
fire
have
them.
Gendry
said
to,
I
should
have
listened.
If
she
hadnвЂ™t
thrown
them
that
axe
theyвЂ™d
all
be
dead.
For
a
moment
she
was
afraid,
but
they
rode
past
her
without
a
flicker
of
interest.
Only
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
so
much
as
glanced
in
her
direction,
and
his
eyes
passed
right
over
her.
He
does
not
know
me,
she
thought.
Arry
was
a
fierce
little
boy
with
a
sword,
and
IвЂ™m
just
a
grey
mouse
girl
with
a
pail.

She
spent
the
rest
of
that
day
scrubbing
steps
inside
the
Wailing
Tower.
By
evenfall
her
hands
were
raw
and
bleeding
and
her
arms
so
sore
they
trembled
when
she
lugged
the
pail
back
to
the
cellar.
Too
tired
even
for
food,
Arya
begged
WeeseвЂ™s
pardons
and
crawled
into
her
straw
to
sleep.
вЂњWeese,вЂќ
she
yawned.
вЂњDunsen,
Chiswyck,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.
The
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.вЂќ
She
thought
she
might
add
three
more
names
to
her
prayer,
but
she
was
too
tired
to
decide
tonight.

Arya
was
dreaming
of
wolves
running
wild
through
the
wood
when
a
strong
hand
clamped
down
over
her
mouth
like
smooth
warm
stone,
solid
and
unyielding.
She
woke
at
once,
squirming
and
struggling.
вЂњA
girl
says
nothing,вЂќ
a
voice
whispered
close
behind
her
ear.
вЂњA
girl
keeps
her
lips
closed,
no
one
hears,
and
friends
may
talk
in
secret.
Yes?вЂќ

Heart
pounding,
Arya
managed
the
tiniest
of
nods.

Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
took
his
hand
away.
The
cellar
was
black
as
pitch
and
she
could
not
see
his
face,
even
inches
away.
She
could
smell
him,
though;
his
skin
smelled
clean
and
soapy,
and
he
had
scented
his
hair.
вЂњA
boy
becomes
a
girl,вЂќ
he
murmured.

вЂњI
was
always
a
girl.
I
didnвЂ™t
think
you
saw
me.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
sees.
A
man
knows.вЂќ

She
remembered
that
she
hated
him.
вЂњYou
scared
me.
YouвЂ™re
one
of
them
now,
I
should
have
let
you
burn.
What
are
you
doing
here?
Go
away
or
IвЂ™ll
yell
for
Weese.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
pays
his
debts.
A
man
owes
three.вЂќ

вЂњThree?вЂќ

вЂњThe
Red
God
has
his
due,
sweet
girl,
and
only
death
may
pay
for
life.
This
girl
took
three
that
were
his.
This
girl
must
give
three
in
their
places.
Speak
the
names,
and
a
man
will
do
the
rest.вЂќ

He
wants
to
help
me,
Arya
realized
with
a
rush
of
hope
that
made
her
dizzy.
вЂњTake
me
to
Riverrun,
itвЂ™s
not
far,
if
we
stole
some
horses
we
couldвЂ”вЂќ

He
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips.
вЂњThree
lives
you
shall
have
of
me.
No
more,
no
less.
Three
and
we
are
done.
So
a
girl
must
ponder.вЂќ
He
kissed
her
hair
softly.
вЂњBut
not
too
long.вЂќ

By
the
time
Arya
lit
her
stub
of
a
candle,
only
a
faint
smell
remained
of
him,
a
whiff
of
ginger
and
cloves
lingering
in
the
air.
The
woman
in
the
next
niche
rolled
over
on
her
straw
and
complained
of
the
light,
so
Arya
blew
it
out.
When
she
closed
her
eyes,
she
saw
faces
swimming
before
her.
Joffrey
and
his
mother,
Ilyn
Payne
and
Meryn
Trant
and
Sandor
CleganeвЂ¦
but
they
were
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing
hundreds
of
miles
away,
and
Ser
Gregor
had
lingered
only
a
few
nights
before
departing
again
for
more
foraging,
taking
Raff
and
Chiswyck
and
the
Tickler
with
him.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
was
here,
though,
and
she
hated
him
almost
as
much.
DidnвЂ™t
she?
She
wasnвЂ™t
certain.
And
there
was
always
Weese.

She
thought
of
him
again
the
next
morning,
when
lack
of
sleep
made
her
yawn.
вЂњWeasel,вЂќ
Weese
purred,
вЂњnext
time
I
see
that
mouth
droop
open,
IвЂ™ll
pull
out
your
tongue
and
feed
it
to
my
bitch.вЂќ
He
twisted
her
ear
between
his
fingers
to
make
certain
sheвЂ™d
heard,
and
told
her
to
get
back
to
those
steps,
he
wanted
them
clean
down
to
the
third
landing
by
nightfall.

As
she
worked,
Arya
thought
about
the
people
she
wanted
dead.
She
pretended
she
could
see
their
faces
on
the
steps,
and
scrubbed
harder
to
wipe
them
away.
The
Starks
were
at
war
with
the
Lannisters
and
she
was
a
Stark,
so
she
should
kill
as
many
Lannisters
as
she
could,
that
was
what
you
did
in
wars.
But
she
didnвЂ™t
think
she
should
trust
Jaqen.
I
should
kill
them
myself.
Whenever
her
father
had
condemned
a
man
to
death,
he
did
the
deed
himself
with
Ice,
his
greatsword.
вЂњIf
you
would
take
a
manвЂ™s
life,
you
owe
it
to
him
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
hear
his
last
words,вЂќ
sheвЂ™d
heard
him
tell
Robb
and
Jon
once.

The
next
day
she
avoided
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
and
the
day
after
that.
It
was
not
hard.
She
was
very
small
and
Harrenhal
was
very
large,
full
of
places
where
a
mouse
could
hide.

And
then
Ser
Gregor
returned,
earlier
than
expected,
driving
a
herd
of
goats
this
time
in
place
of
a
herd
of
prisoners.
She
heard
heвЂ™d
lost
four
men
in
one
of
Lord
BericвЂ™s
night
raids,
but
those
Arya
hated
returned
unscathed
and
took
up
residence
on
the
second
floor
of
the
Wailing
Tower.
Weese
saw
that
they
were
well
supplied
with
drink.
вЂњThey
always
have
a
good
thirst,
that
lot,вЂќ
he
grumbled.
вЂњWeasel,
go
up
and
ask
if
theyвЂ™ve
got
any
clothes
that
need
mending,
IвЂ™ll
have
the
women
see
to
it.вЂќ

Arya
ran
up
her
well-scrubbed
steps.
No
one
paid
her
any
mind
when
she
entered.
Chiswyck
was
seated
by
the
fire
with
a
horn
of
ale
to
hand,
telling
one
of
his
funny
stories.
She
dared
not
interrupt,
unless
she
wanted
a
bloody
lip.

вЂњAfter
the
HandвЂ™s
tourney,
it
were,
before
the
war
come,вЂќ
Chiswyck
was
saying.
вЂњWe
were
on
our
ways
back
west,
seven
of
us
with
Ser
Gregor.
Raff
was
with
me,
and
young
Joss
Stilwood,
heвЂ™d
squired
for
Ser
in
the
lists.
Well,
we
come
on
this
pisswater
river,
running
high
on
account
thereвЂ™d
been
rains.
No
way
to
ford,
but
thereвЂ™s
an
alehouse
near,
so
there
we
repair.
Ser
rousts
the
brewer
and
tells
him
to
keep
our
horns
full
till
the
waters
fall,
and
you
should
see
the
manвЂ™s
pig
eyes
shine
at
the
sight
oвЂ™
silver.
So
heвЂ™s
fetching
us
ale,
him
and
his
daughter,
and
poor
thin
stuff
it
is,
no
moreвЂ™n
brown
piss,
which
donвЂ™t
make
me
any
happier,
nor
Ser
neither.
And
all
the
time
this
brewerвЂ™s
saying
how
glad
he
is
to
have
us,
custom
being
slow
on
account
oвЂ™
them
rains.
The
fool
wonвЂ™t
shut
his
yap,
not
him,
though
Ser
is
saying
not
a
word,
just
brooding
on
the
Knight
oвЂ™
Pansies
and
that
buggerвЂ™s
trick
he
played.
You
can
see
how
tight
his
mouth
sits,
so
me
and
the
other
lads
we
know
betterвЂ™n
to
say
a
squeak
to
him,
but
this
brewer
heвЂ™s
got
to
talk,
he
even
asks
how
mвЂ™lord
fared
in
the
jousting.
Ser
just
gave
him
this
look.вЂќ
Chiswyck
cackled,
quaffed
his
ale,
and
wiped
the
foam
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњMeanwhile,
this
daughter
of
his
has
been
fetching
and
pouring,
a
fat
little
thing,
eighteen
or
soвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThirteen,
more
like,вЂќ
Raff
the
Sweetling
drawled.

вЂњWell,
be
that
as
it
may,
sheвЂ™s
not
much
to
look
at,
but
EggonвЂ™s
been
drinking
and
gets
to
touching
her,
and
might
be
I
did
a
little
touching
meself,
and
RaffвЂ™s
telling
young
Stilwood
that
he
ought
tвЂ™
drag
the
girl
upstairs
and
make
hisself
a
man,
giving
the
lad
courage
as
it
were.
Finally
Joss
reaches
up
under
her
skirt,
and
she
shrieks
and
drops
her
flagon
and
goes
running
off
to
the
kitchen.
Well,
it
would
have
ended
right
there,
only
what
does
the
old
fool
do
but
he
goes
to
Ser
and
asks
him
to
make
us
leave
the
girl
alone,
him
being
an
anointed
knight
and
all
such.

вЂњSer
Gregor,
he
wasnвЂ™t
paying
no
mind
to
none
of
our
fun,
but
now
he
looks,
you
know
how
he
does,
and
he
commands
that
the
girl
be
brought
before
him.
Now
the
old
man
has
to
drag
her
out
of
the
kitchen,
and
no
one
to
blame
but
hisself.
Ser
looks
her
over
and
says,
вЂSo
this
is
the
whore
youвЂ™re
so
concerned
forвЂ™
and
this
besotted
old
fool
says,
вЂMy
LaynaвЂ™s
no
whore,
serвЂ™
right
to
GregorвЂ™s
face.
Ser,
he
never
blinks,
just
says,
вЂShe
is
nowвЂ™
tosses
the
old
man
another
silver,
rips
the
dress
off
the
wench,
and
takes
her
right
there
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
da,
her
flopping
and
wiggling
like
a
rabbit
and
making
these
noises.
The
look
on
the
old
manвЂ™s
face,
I
laughed
so
hard
ale
was
coming
out
me
nose.
Then
this
boy
hears
the
noise,
the
son
I
figure,
and
comes
rushing
up
from
the
cellar,
so
Raff
has
to
stick
a
dirk
in
his
belly.
By
then
SerвЂ™s
done,
so
he
goes
back
to
his
drinking
and
we
all
have
a
turn.
Tobbot,
you
know
how
he
is,
he
flops
her
over
and
goes
in
the
back
way.
The
girl
was
done
fighting
by
the
time
I
had
her,
maybe
sheвЂ™d
decided
she
liked
it
after
all,
though
to
tell
the
truth
I
wouldnвЂ™t
have
minded
a
little
wiggling.
And
now
hereвЂ™s
the
best
bitвЂ¦
when
itвЂ™s
all
done,
Ser
tells
the
old
man
that
he
wants
his
change.
The
girl
wasnвЂ™t
worth
a
silver,
he
saysвЂ¦
and
damned
if
that
old
man
didnвЂ™t
fetch
a
fistful
of
coppers,
beg
mвЂ™lordвЂ™s
pardon,
and
thank
him
for
the
custom!вЂќ

The
men
all
roared,
none
louder
than
Chiswyck
himself,
who
laughed
so
hard
at
his
own
story
that
snot
dribbled
from
his
nose
down
into
his
scraggy
grey
beard.
Arya
stood
in
the
shadows
of
the
stairwell
and
watched
him.
She
crept
back
down
to
the
cellars
without
saying
a
word.
When
Weese
found
that
she
hadnвЂ™t
asked
about
the
clothes,
he
yanked
down
her
breeches
and
caned
her
until
blood
ran
down
her
thighs,
but
Arya
closed
her
eyes
and
thought
of
all
the
sayings
Syrio
had
taught
her,
so
she
scarcely
felt
it.

Two
nights
later,
he
sent
her
to
the
Barracks
Hall
to
serve
at
table.
She
was
carrying
a
flagon
of
wine
and
pouring
when
she
glimpsed
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
at
his
trencher
across
the
aisle.
Chewing
her
lip,
Arya
glanced
around
warily
to
make
certain
Weese
was
not
in
sight.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
told
herself.

She
took
a
step,
and
another,
and
with
each
she
felt
less
a
mouse.
She
worked
her
way
down
the
bench,
filling
wine
cups.
Rorge
sat
to
JaqenвЂ™s
right,
deep
drunk,
but
he
took
no
note
of
her.
Arya
leaned
close
and
whispered,
вЂњChiswyck,вЂќ
right
in
JaqenвЂ™s
ear.
The
Lorathi
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
heard.

When
her
flagon
was
empty,
Arya
hurried
down
to
the
cellars
to
refill
it
from
the
cask,
and
quickly
returned
to
her
pouring.
No
one
had
died
of
thirst
while
she
was
gone,
nor
even
noted
her
brief
absence.

Nothing
happened
the
next
day,
nor
the
day
after,
but
on
the
third
day
Arya
went
to
the
kitchens
with
Weese
to
fetch
their
dinner.
вЂњOne
of
the
MountainвЂ™s
men
fell
off
a
wallwalk
last
night
and
broke
his
fool
neck,вЂќ
she
heard
Weese
tell
a
cook.

вЂњDrunk?вЂќ
the
woman
asked.

вЂњNo
moreвЂ™n
usual.
Some
are
saying
it
was
HarrenвЂ™s
ghost
flung
him
down.вЂќ
He
snorted
to
show
what
he
thought
of
such
notions.

It
wasnвЂ™t
Harren,
Arya
wanted
to
say,
it
was
me.
She
had
killed
Chiswyck
with
a
whisper,
and
she
would
kill
two
more
before
she
was
through.
IвЂ™m
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal,
she
thought.
And
that
night,
there
was
one
less
name
to
hate.





CATELYN

The
meeting
place
was
a
grassy
sward
dotted
with
pale
grey
mushrooms
and
the
raw
stumps
of
felled
trees.

вЂњWe
are
the
first,
my
lady,вЂќ
Hallis
Mollen
said
as
they
reined
up
amidst
the
stumps,
alone
between
the
armies.
The
direwolf
banner
of
House
Stark
flapped
and
fluttered
atop
the
lance
he
bore.
Catelyn
could
not
see
the
sea
from
here,
but
she
could
feel
how
close
it
was.
The
smell
of
salt
was
heavy
on
the
wind
gusting
from
the
east.

Stannis
BaratheonвЂ™s
foragers
had
cut
the
trees
down
for
his
siege
towers
and
catapults.
Catelyn
wondered
how
long
the
grove
had
stood,
and
whether
Ned
had
rested
here
when
he
led
his
host
south
to
lift
the
last
siege
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
He
had
won
a
great
victory
that
day,
all
the
greater
for
being
bloodless.

Gods
grant
that
I
shall
do
the
same,
Catelyn
prayed.
Her
own
liege
men
thought
she
was
mad
even
to
come.
вЂњThis
is
no
fight
of
ours,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
had
said.
вЂњI
know
the
king
would
not
wish
his
mother
to
put
herself
at
risk.вЂќ

вЂњWe
are
all
at
risk,вЂќ
she
told
him,
perhaps
too
sharply.
вЂњDo
you
think
I
wish
to
be
here,
ser?вЂќ
I
belong
at
Riverrun
with
my
dying
father,
at
Winterfell
with
my
sons.
вЂњRobb
sent
me
south
to
speak
for
him,
and
speak
for
him
I
shall.вЂќ
It
would
be
no
easy
thing
to
forge
a
peace
between
these
brothers,
Catelyn
knew,
yet
for
the
good
of
the
realm,
it
must
be
tried.

Across
rain-sodden
flelds
and
stony
ridges,
she
could
see
the
great
castle
of
StormвЂ™s
End
rearing
up
against
the
sky,
its
back
to
the
unseen
sea.
Beneath
that
mass
of
pale
grey
stone,
the
encircling
army
of
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon
looked
as
small
and
insignificant
as
mice
with
banners.

The
songs
said
that
StormвЂ™s
End
had
been
raised
in
ancient
days
by
Durran,
the
first
Storm
King,
who
had
won
the
love
of
the
fair
Elenei,
daughter
of
the
sea
god
and
the
goddess
of
the
wind.
On
the
night
of
their
wedding,
Elenei
had
yielded
her
maidenhood
to
a
mortalвЂ™s
love
and
thus
doomed
herself
to
a
mortalвЂ™s
death,
and
her
grieving
parents
had
unleashed
their
wrath
and
sent
the
winds
and
waters
to
batter
down
DurranвЂ™s
hold.
His
friends
and
brothers
and
wedding
guests
were
crushed
beneath
collapsing
walls
or
blown
out
to
sea,
but
Elenei
sheltered
Durran
within
her
arms
so
he
took
no
harm,
and
when
the
dawn
came
at
last
he
declared
war
upon
the
gods
and
vowed
to
rebuild.

Five
more
castles
he
built,
each
larger
and
stronger
than
the
last,
only
to
see
them
smashed
asunder
when
the
gale
winds
came
howling
up
Shipbreaker
Bay,
driving
great
walls
of
water
before
them.
His
lords
pleaded
with
him
to
build
inland;
his
priests
told
him
he
must
placate
the
gods
by
giving
Elenei
back
to
the
sea;
even
his
smallfolk
begged
him
to
relent.
Durran
would
have
none
of
it.
A
seventh
castle
he
raised,
most
massive
of
all.
Some
said
the
children
of
the
forest
helped
him
build
it,
shaping
the
stones
with
magic;
others
claimed
that
a
small
boy
told
him
what
he
must
do,
a
boy
who
would
grow
to
be
Bran
the
Builder.
No
matter
how
the
tale
was
told,
the
end
was
the
same.
Though
the
angry
gods
threw
storm
after
storm
against
it,
the
seventh
castle
stood
defiant,
and
Durran
Godsgrief
and
fair
Elenei
dwelt
there
together
until
the
end
of
their
days.

Gods
do
not
forget,
and
still
the
gales
came
raging
up
the
narrow
sea.
Yet
StormвЂ™s
End
endured,
through
centuries
and
tens
of
centuries,
a
castle
like
no
other.
Its
great
curtain
wall
was
a
hundred
feet
high,
unbroken
by
arrow
slit
or
postern,
everywhere
rounded,
curving,
smooth,
its
stones
fit
so
cunningly
together
that
nowhere
was
crevice
nor
angle
nor
gap
by
which
the
wind
might
enter.
That
wall
was
said
to
be
forty
feet
thick
at
its
narrowest,
and
near
eighty
on
the
seaward
face,
a
double
course
of
stones
with
an
inner
core
of
sand
and
rubble.
Within
that
mighty
bulwark,
the
kitchens
and
stables
and
yards
sheltered
safe
from
wind
and
wave.
Of
towers,
there
was
but
one,
a
colossal
drum
tower,
windowless
where
it
faced
the
sea,
so
large
that
it
was
granary
and
barracks
and
feast
hall
and
lordвЂ™s
dwelling
all
in
one,
crowned
by
massive
battlements
that
made
it
look
from
afar
like
a
spiked
flst
atop
an
upthrust
arm.

вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
Hal
Mollen
called.
Two
riders
had
emerged
from
the
tidy
little
camp
beneath
the
castle,
and
were
coming
toward
them
at
a
slow
walk.
вЂњThat
will
be
King
Stannis.вЂќ

вЂњNo
doubt.вЂќ
Catelyn
watched
them
come.
Stannis
it
must
be,
yet
that
is
not
the
Baratheon
banner.
It
was
a
bright
yellow,
not
the
rich
gold
of
RenlyвЂ™s
standards,
and
the
device
it
bore
was
red,
though
she
could
not
make
out
its
shape.

Renly
would
be
last
to
arrive.
He
had
told
her
as
much
when
she
set
out.
He
did
not
propose
to
mount
his
horse
until
he
saw
his
brother
well
on
his
way.
The
first
to
arrive
must
wait
on
the
other,
and
Renly
would
do
no
waiting.
It
is
a
sort
of
game
kings
play,
she
told
herself.
Well,
she
was
no
king,
so
she
need
not
play
it.
Catelyn
was
practiced
at
waiting.

As
he
neared,
she
saw
that
Stannis
wore
a
crown
of
red
gold
with
points
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
flames.
His
belt
was
studded
with
garnets
and
yellow
topaz,
and
a
great
square-cut
ruby
was
set
in
the
hilt
of
the
sword
he
wore.
Otherwise
his
dress
was
plain:
studded
leather
jerkin
over
quilted
doublet,
worn
boots,
breeches
of
brown
roughspun.
The
device
on
his
sun-yellow
banner
showed
a
red
heart
surrounded
by
a
blaze
of
orange
fire.
The
crowned
stag
was
there,
yesвЂ¦
shrunken
and
enclosed
within
the
heart.
Even
more
curious
was
his
standard
bearerвЂ”a
woman,
garbed
all
in
reds,
face
shadowed
within
the
deep
hood
of
her
scarlet
cloak.
A
red
priestess,
Catelyn
thought,
wondering.
The
sect
was
numerous
and
powerful
in
the
Free
Cities
and
the
distant
east,
but
there
were
few
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

вЂњLady
Stark,вЂќ
Stannis
Baratheon
said
with
chill
courtesy
as
he
reined
up.
He
inclined
his
head,
balder
than
she
remembered.

вЂњLord
Stannis,вЂќ
she
returned.

Beneath
the
tight-trimmed
beard
his
heavy
jaw
clenched
hard,
yet
he
did
not
hector
her
about
titles.
For
that
she
was
duly
grateful.
вЂњI
had
not
thought
to
find
you
at
StormвЂ™s
End.вЂќ

вЂњI
had
not
thought
to
be
here.вЂќ

His
deepset
eyes
regarded
her
uncomfortably.
This
was
not
a
man
made
for
easy
courtesies.
вЂњI
am
sorry
for
your
lordвЂ™s
death,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњthough
Eddard
Stark
was
no
friend
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
never
your
enemy,
my
lord.
When
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
held
you
prisoned
in
that
castle,
starving,
it
was
Eddard
Stark
who
broke
the
siege.вЂќ

вЂњAt
my
brotherвЂ™s
command,
not
for
love
of
me,вЂќ
Stannis
answered.
вЂњLord
Eddard
did
his
duty,
I
will
not
deny
it.
Did
I
ever
do
less?
I
should
have
been
RobertвЂ™s
Hand.вЂќ

вЂњThat
was
your
brotherвЂ™s
will.
Ned
never
wanted
it.вЂќ

вЂњYet
he
took
it.
That
which
should
have
been
mine.
Still,
I
give
you
my
word,
you
shall
have
justice
for
his
murder.вЂќ

How
they
loved
to
promise
heads,
these
men
who
would
be
king.
вЂњYour
brother
promised
me
the
same.
But
if
truth
be
told,
I
would
sooner
have
my
daughters
back,
and
leave
justice
to
the
gods.
Cersei
still
holds
my
Sansa,
and
of
Arya
there
has
been
no
word
since
the
day
of
RobertвЂ™s
death.вЂќ

вЂњIf
your
children
are
found
when
I
take
the
city,
they
shall
be
sent
to
you.вЂќ
Alive
or
dead,
his
tone
implied.

вЂњAnd
when
shall
that
be,
Lord
Stannis?
KingвЂ™s
Landing
is
close
to
your
Dragonstone,
but
I
find
you
here
instead.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
frank,
Lady
Stark.
Very
well,
IвЂ™ll
answer
you
frankly.
To
take
the
city,
I
need
the
power
of
these
southron
lords
I
see
across
the
field.
My
brother
has
them.
I
must
needs
take
them
from
him.вЂќ

вЂњMen
give
their
allegiance
where
they
will,
my
lord.
These
lords
swore
fealty
to
Robert
and
House
Baratheon.
If
you
and
your
brother
were
to
put
aside
your
quarrelвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
have
no
quarrel
with
Renly,
should
he
prove
dutiful.
I
am
his
elder,
and
his
king.
I
want
only
what
is
mine
by
rights.
Renly
owes
me
loyalty
and
obedience.
I
mean
to
have
it.
From
him,
and
from
these
other
lords.вЂќ
Stannis
studied
her
face.
вЂњAnd
what
cause
brings
you
to
this
field,
my
lady?
Has
House
Stark
cast
its
lot
with
my
brother,
is
that
the
way
of
it?вЂќ

This
one
will
never
bend,
she
thought,
yet
she
must
try
nonetheless.
Too
much
was
at
stake.
вЂњMy
son
reigns
as
King
in
the
North,
by
the
will
of
our
lords
and
people.
He
bends
the
knee
to
no
man,
but
holds
out
the
hand
of
friendship
to
all.вЂќ

вЂњKings
have
no
friends,вЂќ
Stannis
said
bluntly,
вЂњonly
subjects
and
enemies.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
brothers,вЂќ
a
cheerful
voice
called
out
behind
her.
Catelyn
glanced
over
her
shoulder
as
Lord
RenlyвЂ™s
palfrey
picked
her
way
through
the
stumps.
The
younger
Baratheon
was
splendid
in
his
green
velvet
doublet
and
satin
cloak
trimmed
in
vair.
The
crown
of
golden
roses
girded
his
temples,
jade
stagвЂ™s
head
rising
over
his
forehead,
long
black
hair
spilling
out
beneath.
jagged
chunks
of
black
diamond
studded
his
swordbelt,
and
a
chain
of
gold
and
emeralds
looped
around
his
neck.

Renly
had
chosen
a
woman
to
carry
his
banner
as
well,
though
Brienne
hid
face
and
form
behind
plate
armor
that
gave
no
hint
of
her
sex.
Atop
her
twelve-foot
lance,
the
crowned
stag
pranced
black-on-gold
as
the
wind
off
the
sea
rippled
the
cloth.

His
brotherвЂ™s
greeting
was
curt.
вЂњLord
Renly.вЂќ

вЂњKing
Renly.
Can
that
truly
be
you,
Stannis?вЂќ

Stannis
frowned.
вЂњWho
else
should
it
be?вЂќ

Renly
gave
an
easy
shrug.
вЂњWhen
I
saw
that
standard,
I
could
not
be
certain.
Whose
banner
do
you
bear?вЂќ

вЂњMine
own.вЂќ

The
red-clad
priestess
spoke
up.
вЂњThe
king
has
taken
for
his
sigil
the
fiery
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light.вЂќ

Renly
seemed
amused
by
that.
вЂњAll
for
the
good.
If
we
both
use
the
same
banner,
the
battle
will
be
terribly
confused.вЂќ

Catelyn
said,
вЂњLet
us
hope
there
will
be
no
battle.
We
three
share
a
common
foe
who
would
destroy
us
all.вЂќ

Stannis
studied
her,
unsmiling.
вЂњThe
Iron
Throne
is
mine
by
rights.
All
those
who
deny
that
are
my
foes.вЂќ

вЂњThe
whole
of
the
realm
denies
it,
brother,вЂќ
said
Renly.
вЂњOld
men
deny
it
with
their
death
rattle,
and
unborn
children
deny
it
in
their
mothersвЂ™wombs.
They
deny
it
in
Dorne
and
they
deny
it
on
the
Wall.
No
one
wants
you
for
their
king.
Sorry.вЂќ

Stannis
clenched
his
jaw,
his
face
taut.
вЂњI
swore
I
would
never
treat
with
you
while
you
wore
your
traitorвЂ™s
crown.
Would
that
I
had
kept
to
that
vow.вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
folly,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
sharply.
вЂњLord
Tywin
sits
at
Harrenhal
with
twenty
thousand
swords.
The
remnants
of
the
KingslayerвЂ™s
army
have
regrouped
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
another
Lannister
host
gathers
beneath
the
shadow
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
Cersei
and
her
son
hold
KingвЂ™s
Landing
and
your
precious
Iron
Throne.
You
each
name
yourself
king,
yet
the
kingdom
bleeds,
and
no
one
lifts
a
sword
to
defend
it
but
my
son.вЂќ

Renly
shrugged.
вЂњYour
son
has
won
a
few
battles.
I
shall
win
the
war.
The
Lannisters
can
wait
my
pleasure.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
have
proposals
to
make,
make
them,вЂќ
Stannis
said
brusquely,
вЂњor
I
will
be
gone.вЂќ

вЂњVery
well,вЂќ
said
Renly.
вЂњI
propose
that
you
dismount,
bend
your
knee,
and
swear
me
your
allegiance.вЂќ

Stannis
choked
back
rage.
вЂњThat
you
shall
never
have.вЂќ

вЂњYou
served
Robert,
why
not
me?вЂќ

вЂњRobert
was
my
elder
brother.
You
are
the
younger.вЂќ

вЂњYounger,
bolder,
and
far
more
comelyвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦and
a
thief
and
a
usurper
besides.вЂќ

Renly
shrugged.
вЂњThe
Targaryens
called
Robert
usurper.
He
seemed
to
be
able
to
bear
the
shame.
So
shall
I.вЂќ

This
will
not
do.
вЂњListen
to
yourselves!
If
you
were
sons
of
mine,
I
would
bang
your
heads
together
and
lock
you
in
a
bedchamber
until
you
remembered
that
you
were
brothers.вЂќ

Stannis
frowned
at
her.
вЂњYou
presume
too
much,
Lady
Stark.
I
am
the
rightful
king,
and
your
son
no
less
a
traitor
than
my
brother
here.
His
day
will
come
as
well.вЂќ

The
naked
threat
fanned
her
fury.
вЂњYou
are
very
free
to
name
others
traitor
and
usurper,
my
lord,
yet
how
are
you
any
different?
You
say
you
alone
are
the
rightful
king,
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
Robert
had
two
sons.
By
all
the
laws
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
Prince
Joffrey
is
his
rightful
heir,
and
Tornmen
after
himвЂ¦
and
we
are
all
traitors,
however
good
our
reasons.вЂќ

Renly
laughed.
вЂњYou
must
forgive
Lady
Catelyn,
Stannis.
SheвЂ™s
come
all
the
way
down
from
Riverrun,
a
long
way
ahorse.
I
fear
she
never
saw
your
little
letter.вЂќ

вЂњJoffrey
is
not
my
brotherвЂ™s
seed,вЂќ
Stannis
said
bluntly.
вЂњNor
is
Tommen.
They
are
bastards.
The
girl
as
well.
All
three
of
them
abominations
born
of
incest.вЂќ

Would
even
Cersei
be
so
mad?
Catelyn
was
speechless.

вЂњIsnвЂ™t
that
a
sweet
story,
my
lady?вЂќ
Renly
asked.
вЂњI
was
camped
at
Horn
Hill
when
Lord
Tarly
received
his
letter,
and
I
must
say,
it
took
my
breath
away.вЂќ
He
smiled
at
his
brother.
вЂњI
had
never
suspected
you
were
so
clever,
Stannis.
Were
it
only
true,
you
would
indeed
be
RobertвЂ™s
heir.вЂќ

вЂњWere
it
true?
Do
you
name
me
a
liar?вЂќ

вЂњCan
you
prove
any
word
of
this
fable?вЂќ

Stannis
ground
his
teeth.

Robert
could
never
have
known,
Catelyn
thought,
or
Cersei
would
have
lost
her
head
in
an
instant.
вЂњLord
Stannis,вЂќ
she
asked,
вЂњif
you
knew
the
queen
to
be
guilty
of
such
monstrous
crimes,
why
did
you
keep
silent?
вЂњ

вЂњI
did
not
keep
silent,вЂќ
Stannis
declared.
вЂњI
brought
my
suspicions
to
Jon
Arryn.вЂќ

вЂњRather
than
your
own
brother?вЂќ

вЂњMy
brotherвЂ™s
regard
for
me
was
never
more
than
dutiful,вЂќ
said
Stannis.
вЂњFrom
me,
such
accusations
would
have
seemed
peevish
and
self-serving,
a
means
of
placing
myself
first
in
the
line
of
succession.
I
believed
Robert
would
be
more
disposed
to
listen
if
the
charges
came
from
Lord
Arryn,
whom
he
loved.вЂќ

вЂњAh,вЂќ
said
Renly.
вЂњSo
we
have
the
word
of
a
dead
man.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
think
he
died
by
happenstance,
you
purblind
fool?
Cersei
had
him
poisoned,
for
fear
he
would
reveal
her.
Lord
Jon
had
been
gathering
certain
proofsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”which
doubtless
died
with
him.
How
inconvenient.вЂќ

Catelyn
was
remembering,
fitting
pieces
together.
вЂњMy
sister
Lysa
accused
the
queen
of
killing
her
husband
in
a
letter
she
sent
me
at
Winterfell,вЂќ
she
admitted.
вЂњLater,
in
the
Eyrie,
she
laid
the
murder
at
the
feet
of
the
queenвЂ™s
brother
Tyrion.вЂќ

Stannis
snorted.
вЂњIf
you
step
in
a
nest
of
snakes,
does
it
matter
which
one
bites
you
first?вЂќ

вЂњAll
this
of
snakes
and
incest
is
droll,
but
it
changes
nothing.
You
may
well
have
the
better
claim,
Stannis,
but
I
still
have
the
larger
army.вЂќ
RenlyвЂ™s
hand
slid
inside
his
cloak.
Stannis
saw,
and
reached
at
once
for
the
hilt
of
his
sword,
but
before
he
could
draw
steel
his
brother
producedвЂ¦
a
peach.
вЂњWould
you
like
one,
brother?вЂќ
Renly
asked,
smiling.
вЂњFrom
Highgarden.
YouвЂ™ve
never
tasted
anything
so
sweet,
I
promise
you.вЂќ
He
took
a
bite.
juice
ran
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth.

вЂњI
did
not
come
here
to
eat
fruit.вЂќ
Stannis
was
fuming.

вЂњMy
lords!вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњWe
ought
to
be
hammering
out
the
terms
of
an
alliance,
not
trading
taunts.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
should
never
refuse
to
taste
a
peach,вЂќ
Renly
said
as
he
tossed
the
stone
away.
вЂњHe
may
never
get
the
chance
again.
Life
is
short,
Stannis.
Remember
what
the
Starks
say.
Winter
is
coming.вЂќ
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.

вЂњI
did
not
come
here
to
be
threatened,
either.вЂќ

вЂњNor
were
you,вЂќ
Renly
snapped
back.
вЂњWhen
I
make
threats,
youвЂ™ll
know
it.
If
truth
be
told,
IвЂ™ve
never
liked
you,
Stannis,
but
you
are
my
own
blood,
and
I
have
no
wish
to
slay
you.
So
if
it
is
StormвЂ™s
End
you
want,
take
itвЂ¦
as
a
brotherвЂ™s
gift.
As
Robert
once
gave
it
to
me,
I
give
it
to
you.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
not
yours
to
give.
It
is
mine
by
rights.вЂќ

Sighing,
Renly
half
turned
in
the
saddle.
вЂњWhat
am
I
to
do
with
this
brother
of
mine,
Brienne?
He
refuses
my
peach,
he
refuses
my
castle,
he
even
shunned
my
weddingвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWe
both
know
your
wedding
was
a
mummerвЂ™s
farce.
A
year
ago
you
were
scheming
to
make
the
girl
one
of
RobertвЂ™s
whores.вЂќ

вЂњA
year
ago
I
was
scheming
to
make
the
girl
RobertвЂ™s
queen,вЂќ
Renly
said,
вЂњbut
what
does
it
matter?
The
boar
got
Robert
and
I
got
Margaery.
YouвЂ™ll
be
pleased
to
know
she
came
to
me
a
maid.вЂќ

вЂњIn
your
bed
sheвЂ™s
like
to
die
that
way.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
expect
IвЂ™ll
get
a
son
on
her
within
the
year.
Pray,
how
many
sons
do
you
have,
Stannis?
Oh,
yesвЂ”none.вЂќ
Renly
smiled
innocently.
вЂњAs
to
your
daughter,
I
understand.
If
my
wife
looked
like
yours,
IвЂ™d
send
my
fool
to
service
her
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњEnough!вЂќ
Stannis
roared.
вЂњI
will
not
be
mocked
to
my
face,
do
you
hear
me?
I
will
not!вЂќ
He
yanked
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.
The
steel
gleamed
strangely
bright
in
the
wan
sunlight,
now
red,
now
yellow,
now
blazing
white.
The
air
around
it
seemed
to
shimmer,
as
if
from
heat.

CatelynвЂ™s
horse
whinnied
and
backed
away
a
step,
but
Brienne
moved
between
the
brothers,
her
own
blade
in
hand.
вЂњPut
up
your
steel!вЂќ
she
shouted
at
Stannis.

Cersei
Lannister
is
laughing
herself
breathless,
Catelyn
thought
wearily.

Stannis
pointed
his
shining
sword
at
his
brother.
вЂњI
am
not
without
mercy,вЂќ
thundered
he
who
was
notoriously
without
mercy.
вЂњNor
do
I
wish
to
sully
Lightbringer
with
a
brotherвЂ™s
blood.
For
the
sake
of
the
mother
who
bore
us
both,
I
will
give
you
this
night
to
rethink
your
folly,
Renly.
Strike
your
banners
and
come
to
me
before
dawn,
and
I
will
grant
you
StormвЂ™s
End
and
your
old
seat
on
the
council
and
even
name
you
my
heir
until
a
son
is
born
to
me.
Otherwise,
I
shall
destroy
you.вЂќ

Renly
laughed.
вЂњStannis,
thatвЂ™s
a
very
pretty
sword,
IвЂ™ll
grant
you,
but
I
think
the
glow
off
it
has
ruined
your
eyes.
Look
across
the
fields,
brother.
Can
you
see
all
those
banners?вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
think
a
few
bolts
of
cloth
will
make
you
king?вЂќ

вЂњTyrell
swords
will
make
me
king.
Rowan
and
Tarly
and
Caron
will
make
me
king,
with
axe
and
mace
and
warhammer.
Tarth
arrows
and
Penrose
lances,
Fossoway,
Cuy,
Mullendore,
Estermont,
Selmy,
Hightower,
Oakheart,
Crane,
Caswell,
Blackbar,
Morrigen,
Beesbury,
Shermer,
Dunn,
FootlyвЂ¦
even
House
Florent,
your
own
wifeвЂ™s
brothers
and
uncles,
they
will
make
me
king.
All
the
chivalry
of
the
south
rides
with
me,
and
that
is
the
least
part
of
my
power.
My
foot
is
coming
behind,
a
hundred
thousand
swords
and
spears
and
pikes.
And
you
will
destroy
me?
With
what,
pray?
That
paltry
rabble
I
see
there
huddled
under
the
castle
walls?
IвЂ™ll
call
them
five
thousand
and
be
generous,
codfish
lords
and
onion
knights
and
sellswords.
Half
of
them
are
like
to
come
over
to
me
before
the
battle
starts.
You
have
fewer
than
four
hundred
horse,
my
scouts
tell
meвЂ”freeriders
in
boiled
leather
who
will
not
stand
an
instant
against
armored
lances.
I
do
not
care
how
seasoned
a
warrior
you
think
you
are,
Stannis,
that
host
of
yours
wonвЂ™t
survive
the
first
charge
of
my
vanguard.вЂќ

вЂњWe
shall
see,
brother.вЂќ
Some
of
the
light
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
world
when
Stannis
slid
his
sword
back
into
its
scabbard.
вЂњCome
the
dawn,
we
shall
see.вЂќ

вЂњI
hope
your
new
godвЂ™s
a
merciful
one,
brother.вЂќ

Stannis
snorted
and
galloped
away,
disdainful.
The
red
priestess
lingered
a
moment
behind.
вЂњLook
to
your
own
sins,
Lord
Renly,вЂќ
she
said
as
she
wheeled
her
horse
around.

Catelyn
and
Lord
Renly
returned
together
to
the
camp
where
his
thousands
and
her
few
waited
their
return.
вЂњThat
was
amusing,
if
not
terribly
profitable,вЂќ
he
commented.
вЂњI
wonder
where
I
can
get
a
sword
like
that?
Well,
doubtless
Loras
will
make
me
a
gift
of
it
after
the
battle.
it
grieves
me
that
it
must
come
to
this.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
a
cheerful
way
of
grieving,вЂќ
said
Catelyn,
whose
distress
was
not
feigned.

вЂњDo
I?вЂќ
Renly
shrugged.
вЂњSo
be
it.
Stannis
was
never
the
most
cherished
of
brothers,
I
confess.
Do
you
suppose
this
tale
of
his
is
true?
If
Joffrey
is
the
KingslayerвЂ™s
getвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”your
brother
is
the
lawful
heir.вЂќ

вЂњWhile
he
lives,вЂќ
Renly
admitted.
вЂњThough
itвЂ™s
a
foolвЂ™s
law,
wouldnвЂ™t
you
agree?
Why
the
oldest
son,
and
not
the
best-fitted?
The
crown
will
suit
me,
as
it
never
suited
Robert
and
would
not
suit
Stannis.
I
have
it
in
me
to
be
a
great
king,
strong
yet
generous,
clever,
just,
diligent,
loyal
to
my
friends
and
terrible
to
my
enemies,
yet
capable
of
forgiveness,
patientвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”humble?вЂќ
Catelyn
supplied.

Renly
laughed.
вЂњYou
must
allow
a
king
some
flaws,
my
lady.вЂќ

Catelyn
felt
very
tired.
It
had
all
been
for
nothing.
The
Baratheon
brothers
would
drown
each
other
in
blood
while
her
son
faced
the
Lannisters
alone,
and
nothing
she
could
say
or
do
would
stop
it.
It
is
past
time
I
went
back
to
Riverrun
to
close
my
fatherвЂ™s
eyes,
she
thought.
That
much
at
least
I
can
do.
I
may
be
a
poor
envoy,
but
I
am
a
good
mourner,
gods
save
me.

Their
camp
was
well
sited
atop
a
low
stony
ridge
that
ran
from
north
to
south.
It
was
far
more
orderly
than
the
sprawling
encampment
on
the
Mander,
though
only
a
quarter
as
large.
When
heвЂ™d
learned
of
his
brotherвЂ™s
assault
on
StormвЂ™s
End,
Renly
had
split
his
forces,
much
as
Robb
had
done
at
the
Twins.
His
great
mass
of
foot
he
had
left
behind
at
Bitterbridge
with
his
young
queen,
his
wagons,
carts,
draft
animals,
and
all
his
cumbersome
siege
machinery,
while
Renly
himself
led
his
knights
and
freeriders
in
a
swift
dash
east.

How
like
his
brother
Robert
he
was,
even
in
thatвЂ¦
only
Robert
had
always
had
Eddard
Stark
to
temper
his
boldness
with
caution.
Ned
would
surely
have
prevailed
upon
Robert
to
bring
up
his
whole
force,
to
encircle
Stannis
and
besiege
the
besiegers.
That
choice
Renly
had
denied
himself
in
his
headlong
rush
to
come
to
grips
with
his
brother.
He
had
outdistanced
his
supply
lines,
left
food
and
forage
days
behind
with
all
his
wagons
and
mules
and
oxen.
He
must
come
to
battle
soon,
or
starve.

Catelyn
sent
Hal
Mollen
to
tend
to
their
horses
while
she
accompanied
Renly
back
to
the
royal
pavilion
at
the
heart
of
the
encampment.
Inside
the
walls
of
green
silk,
his
captains
and
lords
bannermen
were
waiting
to
hear
word
of
the
parley.
вЂњMy
brother
has
not
changed,вЂќ
their
young
king
told
them
as
Brienne
unfastened
his
cloak
and
lifted
the
gold-and-jade
crown
from
his
brow.
вЂњCastles
and
courtesies
will
not
appease
him,
he
must
have
blood.
Well,
I
am
of
a
mind
to
grant
his
wish.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,
I
see
no
need
for
battle
here,вЂќ
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
put
in.
вЂњThe
castle
is
strongly
garrisoned
and
well
provisioned,
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
a
seasoned
commander,
and
the
trebuchet
has
not
been
built
that
could
breach
the
walls
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
Let
Lord
Stannis
have
his
siege.
He
will
find
no
joy
in
it,
and
whilst
he
sits
cold
and
hungry
and
profitless,
we
will
take
KingвЂ™s
Landing.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
have
men
say
I
feared
to
face
Stannis?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
fools
will
say
that,вЂќ
Lord
Mathis
argued.

Renly
looked
to
the
others.
вЂњWhat
say
you
all?вЂќ

вЂњI
say
that
Stannis
is
a
danger
to
you,вЂќ
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
declared.
вЂњLeave
him
unblooded
and
he
will
only
grow
stronger,
while
your
own
power
is
diminished
by
battle.
The
Lannisters
will
not
be
beaten
in
a
day.
By
the
time
you
are
done
with
them,
Lord
Stannis
may
be
as
strong
as
youвЂ¦
or
stronger.вЂќ

Others
chorused
their
agreement.
The
king
looked
pleased.
вЂњWe
shall
fight,
then.вЂќ

I
have
failed
Robb
as
I
failed
Ned,
Catelyn
thought.
вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
she
announced.
вЂњIf
you
are
set
on
battle,
my
purpose
here
is
done.
I
ask
your
leave
to
return
to
Riverrun.вЂќ

вЂњYou
do
not
have
it.вЂќ
Renly
seated
himself
on
a
camp
chair.

She
stiffened.
вЂњI
had
hoped
to
help
you
make
a
peace,
my
lord.
I
will
not
help
you
make
a
war.вЂќ

Renly
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњI
daresay
weвЂ™ll
prevail
without
your
five-and-twenty,
my
lady.
I
do
not
mean
for
you
to
take
part
in
the
battle,
only
to
watch
it.вЂќ

вЂњI
was
at
the
Whispering
Wood,
my
lord.
I
have
seen
enough
butchery.
I
came
here
an
envoyвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњAnd
an
envoy
you
shall
leave,вЂќ
Renly
said,
вЂњbut
wiser
than
you
came.
You
shall
see
what
befalls
rebels
with
your
own
eyes,
so
your
son
can
hear
it
from
your
own
lips.
WeвЂ™ll
keep
you
safe,
never
fear.вЂќ
He
turned
away
to
make
his
dispositions.
вЂњLord
Mathis,
you
shall
lead
the
center
of
my
main
battle.
Bryce,
youвЂ™ll
have
the
left.
The
right
is
mine.
Lord
Estermont,
you
shall
command
the
reserve.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
not
fail
you,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Lord
Estermont
replied.

Lord
Mathis
Rowan
spoke
up.
вЂњWho
shall
have
the
van?вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
said
Ser
Jon
Fossoway,
вЂњI
beg
the
honor.вЂќ

вЂњBeg
all
you
like,вЂќ
said
Ser
Guyard
the
Green,
вЂњby
rights
it
should
be
one
of
the
seven
who
strikes
the
first
blow.вЂќ

вЂњIt
takes
more
than
a
pretty
cloak
to
charge
a
shield
wall,вЂќ
Randyll
Tarly
announced.
вЂњI
was
leading
Mace
TyrellвЂ™s
van
when
you
were
still
sucking
on
your
motherвЂ™s
teat,
Guyard.вЂќ

A
clamor
filled
the
pavilion,
as
other
men
loudly
set
forth
their
claims.
The
knights
of
summer,
Catelyn
thought.
Renly
raised
a
hand.
вЂњEnough,
my
lords.
If
I
had
a
dozen
vans,
all
of
you
should
have
one,
but
the
greatest
glory
by
rights
belongs
to
the
greatest
knight.
Ser
Loras
shall
strike
the
first
blow.вЂќ

вЂњWith
a
glad
heart,
Your
Grace.вЂќ
The
Knight
of
Flowers
knelt
before
the
king.
вЂњGrant
me
your
blessing,
and
a
knight
to
ride
beside
me
with
your
banner.
Let
the
stag
and
rose
go
to
battle
side
by
side.вЂќ

Renly
glanced
about
him.
вЂњBrienne.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace?вЂќ
She
was
still
armored
in
her
blue
steel,
though
she
had
taken
off
her
helm.
The
crowded
tent
was
hot,
and
sweat
plastered
limp
yellow
hair
to
her
broad,
homely
face.
вЂњMy
place
is
at
your
side.
I
am
your
sworn
shieldвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOne
of
seven,вЂќ
the
king
reminded
her.
вЂњNever
fear,
four
of
your
fellows
will
be
with
me
in
the
fight.вЂќ

Brienne
dropped
to
her
knees.
вЂњIf
I
must
part
from
Your
Grace,
grant
me
the
honor
of
arming
you
for
battle.вЂќ

Catelyn
heard
someone
snigger
behind
her.
She
loves
him,
poor
thing,
she
thought
sadly.
SheвЂ™d
play
his
squire
just
to
touch
him,
and
never
care
how
great
a
fool
they
think
her.

вЂњGranted,вЂќ
Renly
said.
вЂњNow
leave
me,
all
of
you.
Even
kings
must
rest
before
a
battle.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
вЂњthere
was
a
small
sept
in
the
last
village
we
passed.
If
you
will
not
permit
me
to
depart
for
Riverrun,
grant
me
leave
to
go
there
and
pray.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.
Ser
Robar,
give
Lady
Stark
safe
escort
to
this
septвЂ¦
but
see
that
she
returns
to
us
by
dawn.вЂќ

вЂњYou
might
do
well
to
pray
yourself,вЂќ
Catelyn
added.

вЂњFor
victory?вЂќ

вЂњFor
wisdom.вЂќ

Renly
laughed.
вЂњLoras,
stay
and
help
me
pray.
ItвЂ™s
been
so
long
IвЂ™ve
quite
forgotten
how.
As
to
the
rest
of
you,
I
want
every
man
in
place
by
first
light,
armed,
armored,
and
horsed.
We
shall
give
Stannis
a
dawn
he
will
not
soon
forget.вЂќ

Dusk
was
falling
when
Catelyn
left
the
pavilion.
Ser
Robar
Royce
fell
in
beside
her.
She
knew
him
slightlyвЂ”one
of
Bronze
YohnвЂ™s
sons,
comely
in
a
rough-hewn
way,
a
tourney
warrior
of
some
renown.
Renly
had
gifted
him
with
a
rainbow
cloak
and
a
suit
of
blood
red
armor,
and
named
him
one
of
his
seven.
вЂњYou
are
a
long
way
from
the
Vale,
ser,вЂќ
she
told
him.

вЂњAnd
you
far
from
Winterfell,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
what
brought
me
here,
but
why
have
you
come?
This
is
not
your
battle,
no
more
than
it
is
mine.вЂќ

вЂњI
made
it
my
battle
when
I
made
Renly
my
king.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Royces
are
bannermen
to
House
Arryn.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord
father
owes
Lady
Lysa
fealty,
as
does
his
heir.
A
second
son
must
find
glory
where
he
can.вЂќ
Ser
Robar
shrugged.
вЂњA
man
grows
weary
of
tourneys.вЂќ

He
could
not
be
older
than
one-and-twenty,
Catelyn
thought,
of
an
age
with
his
kingвЂ¦
but
her
king,
her
Robb,
had
more
wisdom
at
fifteen
than
this
youth
had
ever
learned.
Or
so
she
prayed.

In
CatelynвЂ™s
small
corner
of
the
camp,
Shadd
was
slicing
carrots
into
a
kettle,
Hal
Mollen
was
dicing
with
three
of
his
Winterfell
men,
and
Lucas
Blackwood
sat
sharpening
his
dagger.
вЂњLady
Stark,вЂќ
Lucas
said
when
he
saw
her,
вЂњMollen
says
it
is
to
be
battle
at
dawn.вЂќ

вЂњHal
has
the
truth
of
it,вЂќ
she
answered.
And
a
loose
tongue
as
well,
it
would
seem.

вЂњDo
we
fight
or
flee?вЂќ

вЂњWe
pray,
Lucas,вЂќ
she
answered
him.
вЂњWe
pray.вЂќ





SANSA

вЂњThe
longer
you
keep
him
waiting,
the
worse
it
will
go
for
you,вЂќ
Sandor
Clegane
warned
her.

Sansa
tried
to
hurry,
but
her
fingers
fumbled
at
buttons
and
knots.
The
Hound
was
always
rough-tongued,
but
something
in
the
way
he
had
looked
at
her
filled
her
with
dread.
Had
Joffrey
found
out
about
her
meetings
with
Ser
Dontos?
Please
no,
she
thought
as
she
brushed
out
her
hair.
Ser
Dontos
was
her
only
hope.
I
have
to
look
pretty,
Joff
likes
me
to
look
pretty,
heвЂ™s
always
liked
me
in
this
gown,
this
color.
She
smoothed
the
cloth
down.
The
fabric
was
tight
across
her
chest.

When
she
emerged,
Sansa
walked
on
the
HoundвЂ™s
left,
away
from
the
burned
side
of
his
face.
вЂњTell
me
what
IвЂ™ve
done.вЂќ

вЂњNot
you.
Your
kingly
brother.вЂќ

вЂњRobbвЂ™s
a
traitor.вЂќ
Sansa
knew
the
words
by
rote.
вЂњI
had
no
part
in
whatever
he
did.вЂќ
Gods
be
good,
donвЂ™t
let
it
be
the
Kingslayer.
If
Robb
had
harmed
Jaime
Lannister,
it
would
mean
her
life.
She
thought
of
Ser
Ilyn,
and
how
those
terrible
pale
eyes
staring
pitilessly
out
of
that
gaunt
pockmarked
face.

The
Hound
snorted.
вЂњThey
trained
you
well,
little
bird.вЂќ
He
conducted
her
to
the
lower
bailey,
where
a
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
archery
butts.
Men
moved
aside
to
let
them
through.
She
could
hear
Lord
Gyles
coughing.
Loitering
stablehands
eyed
her
insolently,
but
Ser
Horas
Redwyne
averted
his
gaze
as
she
passed,
and
his
brother
Hobber
pretended
not
to
see
her.
A
yellow
cat
was
dying
on
the
ground,
mewling
piteously,
a
crossbow
quarrel
through
its
ribs.
Sansa
stepped
around
it,
feeling
ill.

Ser
Dontos
approached
on
his
broomstick
horse;
since
heвЂ™d
been
too
drunk
to
mount
his
destrier
at
the
tourney,
the
king
had
decreed
that
henceforth
he
must
always
go
horsed.
вЂњBe
brave,вЂќ
he
whispered,
squeezing
her
arm.

Joffrey
stood
in
the
center
of
the
throng,
winding
an
ornate
crossbow.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
were
with
him.
The
sight
of
them
was
enough
to
tie
her
insides
in
knots.

вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
She
fell
to
her
knees.

вЂњKneeling
wonвЂ™t
save
you
now,вЂќ
the
king
said.
вЂњStand
up.
YouвЂ™re
here
to
answer
for
your
brotherвЂ™s
latest
treasons.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,
whatever
my
traitor
brother
has
done,
I
had
no
part.
You
know
that,
I
beg
you,
pleaseвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњGet
her
up!вЂќ

The
Hound
pulled
her
to
her
feet,
not
ungently.

вЂњSer
Lancel,вЂќ
Joff
said,
вЂњtell
her
of
this
outrage.вЂќ

Sansa
had
always
thought
Lancel
Lannister
comely
and
well
spoken,
but
there
was
neither
pity
nor
kindness
in
the
look
he
gave
her.
вЂњUsing
some
vile
sorcery,
your
brother
fell
upon
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
with
an
army
of
wargs,
not
three
days
ride
from
Lannisport.
Thousands
of
good
men
were
butchered
as
they
slept,
without
the
chance
to
lift
sword.
After
the
slaughter,
the
northmen
feasted
on
the
flesh
of
the
slain.вЂќ

Horror
coiled
cold
hands
around
SansaвЂ™s
throat.

вЂњYou
have
nothing
to
say?вЂќ
asked
Joffrey.

вЂњYour
Grace,
the
poor
child
is
shocked
witless,вЂќ
murmured
Ser
Dontos.

вЂњSilence,
fool.вЂќ
Joffrey
lifted
his
crossbow
and
pointed
it
at
her
face.
вЂњYou
Starks
are
as
unnatural
as
those
wolves
of
yours.
IвЂ™ve
not
forgotten
how
your
monster
savaged
me.вЂќ

вЂњThat
was
AryaвЂ™s
wolf,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњLady
never
hurt
you,
but
you
killed
her
anyway.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
your
father
did,вЂќ
Joff
said,
вЂњbut
I
killed
your
father.
I
wish
IвЂ™d
done
it
myself.
I
killed
a
man
last
night
who
was
bigger
than
your
father.
They
came
to
the
gate
shouting
my
name
and
calling
for
bread
like
I
was
some
baker,
but
I
taught
them
better.
I
shot
the
loudest
one
right
through
the
throat.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
he
died?вЂќ
With
the
ugly
iron
head
of
the
quarrel
staring
her
in
the
face,
it
was
hard
to
think
what
else
to
say.

вЂњOf
course
he
died,
he
had
my
quarrel
in
his
throat.
There
was
a
woman
throwing
rocks,
I
got
her
as
well,
but
only
in
the
arm.вЂќ
Frowning,
he
lowered
the
crossbow.
вЂњIвЂ™d
shoot
you
too,
but
if
I
do
Mother
says
theyвЂ™d
kill
my
uncle
Jaime.
Instead
youвЂ™ll
just
be
punished
and
weвЂ™ll
send
word
to
your
brother
about
what
will
happen
to
you
if
he
doesnвЂ™t
yield.
Dog,
hit
her.вЂќ

вЂњLet
me
beat
her!вЂќ
Ser
Dontos
shoved
forward,
tin
armor
clattering.
He
was
armed
with
a
вЂњmorningstarвЂќ
whose
head
was
a
melon.
My
Florian.
She
could
have
kissed
him,
blotchy
skin
and
broken
veins
and
all.
He
trotted
his
broomstick
around
her,
shouting
вЂњTraitor,
traitorвЂќ
and
whacking
her
over
the
head
with
the
melon.
Sansa
covered
herself
with
her
hands,
staggering
every
time
the
fruit
pounded
her,
her
hair
sticky
by
the
second
blow.
People
were
laughing.
The
melon
flew
to
pieces.
Laugh,
Joffrey,
she
prayed
as
the
juice
ran
down
her
face
and
the
front
of
her
blue
silk
gown.
Laugh
and
be
satisfied.

Joffrey
did
not
so
much
as
snigger.
вЂњBoros.
Meryn.вЂќ

Ser
Meryn
Trant
seized
Dontos
by
the
arm
and
flung
him
brusquely
away.
The
red-faced
fool
went
sprawling,
broomstick,
melon,
and
all.
Ser
Boros
seized
Sansa.

вЂњLeave
her
face,вЂќ
Joffrey
commanded.
вЂњI
like
her
pretty.вЂќ

Boros
slammed
a
fist
into
SansaвЂ™s
belly,
driving
the
air
out
of
her.
When
she
doubled
over,
the
knight
grabbed
her
hair
and
drew
his
sword,
and
for
one
hideous
instant
she
was
certain
he
meant
to
open
her
throat.
As
he
laid
the
flat
of
the
blade
across
her
thighs,
she
thought
her
legs
might
break
from
the
force
of
the
blow.
Sansa
screamed.
Tears
welled
in
her
eyes.
It
will
be
over
soon.
She
soon
lost
count
of
the
blows.

вЂњEnough,вЂќ
she
heard
the
Hound
rasp.

вЂњNo
it
isnвЂ™t,вЂќ
the
king
replied.
вЂњBoros,
make
her
naked.вЂќ

Boros
shoved
a
meaty
hand
down
the
front
of
SansaвЂ™s
bodice
and
gave
a
hard
yank.
The
silk
came
tearing
away,
baring
her
to
the
waist.
Sansa
covered
her
breasts
with
her
hands.
She
could
hear
sniggers,
far
off
and
cruel.
вЂњBeat
her
bloody,вЂќ
Joffrey
said,
вЂњweвЂ™ll
see
how
her
brother
fanciesвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhat
is
the
meaning
of
this?вЂќ

The
ImpвЂ™s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip,
and
suddenly
Sansa
was
free.
She
stumbled
to
her
knees,
arms
crossed
over
her
chest,
her
breath
ragged.
вЂњIs
this
your
notion
of
chivalry,
Ser
Boros?вЂќ
Tyrion
Lannister
demanded
angrily.
His
pet
sellsword
stood
with
him,
and
one
of
his
wildlings,
the
one
with
the
burned
eye.
вЂњWhat
sort
of
knight
beats
helpless
maids?вЂќ

вЂњThe
sort
who
serves
his
king,
Imp.вЂќ
Ser
Boros
raised
his
sword,
and
Ser
Meryn
stepped
up
beside
him,
his
blade
scraping
clear
of
its
scabbard.

вЂњCareful
with
those,вЂќ
warned
the
dwarfвЂ™s
sellsword.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
want
to
get
blood
all
over
those
pretty
white
cloaks.вЂќ

вЂњSomeone
give
the
girl
something
to
cover
herself
with,вЂќ
the
Imp
said.
Sandor
Clegane
unfastened
his
cloak
and
tossed
it
at
her.
Sansa
clutched
it
against
her
chest,
fists
bunched
hard
in
the
white
wool.
The
coarse
weave
was
scratchy
against
her
skin,
but
no
velvet
had
ever
felt
so
fine.

вЂњThis
girlвЂ™s
to
be
your
queen,вЂќ
the
Imp
told
Joffrey.
вЂњHave
you
no
regard
for
her
honor?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
punishing
her.вЂќ

вЂњFor
what
crime?
She
did
not
fight
her
brotherвЂ™s
battle.вЂќ

вЂњShe
has
the
blood
of
a
wolf.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
you
have
the
wits
of
a
goose.вЂќ

вЂњYou
canвЂ™t
talk
to
me
that
way.
The
king
can
do
as
he
likes.вЂќ

вЂњAerys
Targaryen
did
as
he
liked.
Has
your
mother
ever
told
you
what
happened
to
him?вЂќ

Ser
Boros
Blount
harrumphed.
вЂњNo
man
threatens
His
Grace
in
the
presence
of
the
Kingsguard.вЂќ

Tyrion
Lannister
raised
an
eyebrow.
вЂњI
am
not
threatening
the
king,
ser,
I
am
educating
my
nephew.
Bronn,
Timett,
the
next
time
Ser
Boros
opens
his
mouth,
kill
him.вЂќ
The
dwarf
smiled.
вЂњNow
that
was
a
threat,
ser.
See
the
difference?вЂќ

Ser
Boros
turned
a
dark
shade
of
red.
вЂњThe
queen
will
hear
of
this!вЂќ

вЂњNo
doubt
she
will.
And
why
wait?
Joffrey,
shall
we
send
for
your
mother?
вЂњ

The
king
flushed.

вЂњNothing
to
say,
Your
Grace?вЂќ
his
uncle
went
on.
вЂњGood.
Learn
to
use
your
ears
more
and
your
mouth
less,
or
your
reign
will
be
shorter
than
I
am.
Wanton
brutality
is
no
way
to
win
your
peopleвЂ™s
loveвЂ¦
or
your
queenвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњFear
is
better
than
love,
Mother
says.вЂќ
Joffrey
pointed
at
Sansa.
вЂњShe
fears
me.вЂќ

The
Imp
sighed.
вЂњYes,
I
see.
A
pity
Stannis
and
Renly
arenвЂ™t
twelve-year-old
girls
as
well.
Bronn,
Timett,
bring
her.вЂќ

Sansa
moved
as
if
in
a
dream.
She
thought
the
ImpвЂ™s
men
would
take
her
back
to
her
bedchamber
in
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast,
but
instead
they
conducted
her
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
She
had
not
set
foot
inside
that
place
since
the
day
her
father
fell
from
grace,
and
it
made
her
feel
faint
to
climb
those
steps
again.

Some
serving
girls
took
charge
of
her,
mouthing
meaningless
comforts
to
stop
her
shaking.
One
stripped
off
the
ruins
of
her
gown
and
smallclothes,
and
another
bathed
her
and
washed
the
sticky
juice
from
her
face
and
her
hair.
As
they
scrubbed
her
down
with
soap
and
sluiced
warm
water
over
her
head,
all
she
could
see
were
the
faces
from
the
bailey.
Knights
are
sworn
to
defend
the
weak,
protect
women,
and
fight
for
the
right,
but
none
of
them
did
a
thing.
Only
Ser
Dontos
had
tried
to
help,
and
he
was
no
longer
a
knight,
no
more
than
the
Imp
was,
nor
the
HoundвЂ¦
the
Hound
hated
knightsвЂ¦
I
hate
them
too,
Sansa
thought.
They
are
no
true
knights,
not
one
of
them.

After
she
was
clean,
plump
ginger-headed
Maester
Frenken
came
to
see
her.
He
bid
her
lie
facedown
on
the
mattress
while
he
spread
a
salve
across
the
angry
red
welts
that
covered
the
backs
of
her
legs.
Afterward
he
mixed
her
a
draught
of
dreamwine,
with
some
honey
so
it
might
go
down
easier.
вЂњSleep
a
bit,
child.
When
you
wake,
all
this
will
seem
a
bad
dream.вЂќ

No
it
wonвЂ™t,
you
stupid
man,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
drank
the
drearnwine
anyway,
and
slept.

It
was
dark
when
she
woke
again,
not
quite
knowing
where
she
was,
the
room
both
strange
and
strangely
familiar.
As
she
rose,
a
stab
of
pain
went
through
her
legs
and
brought
it
all
back.
Tears
filled
her
eyes.
Someone
had
laid
out
a
robe
for
her
beside
the
bed.
Sansa
slipped
it
on
and
opened
the
door.
Outside
stood
a
hard-faced
woman
with
leathery
brown
skin,
three
necklaces
looped
about
her
scrawny
neck.
One
was
gold
and
one
was
silver
and
one
was
made
of
human
ears.
вЂњWhere
does
she
think
sheвЂ™s
going?вЂќ
the
woman
asked,
leaning
on
a
tall
spear.

вЂњThe
godswood.вЂќ
She
had
to
find
Ser
Dontos,
beg
him
to
take
her
home
now
before
it
was
too
late.

вЂњThe
halfman
said
youвЂ™re
not
to
leave,вЂќ
the
woman
said.
вЂњPray
here,
the
gods
will
hear.вЂќ

Meekly,
Sansa
dropped
her
eyes
and
retreated
back
inside.
She
realized
suddenly
why
this
place
seemed
so
familiar.
TheyвЂ™ve
put
me
in
AryaвЂ™s
old
bedchamber,
from
when
Father
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.
All
her
things
are
gone
and
the
furnishings
have
been
moved
around,
but
itвЂ™s
the
sameвЂ¦

A
short
time
later,
a
serving
girl
brought
a
platter
of
cheese
and
bread
and
olives,
with
a
flagon
of
cold
water.
вЂњTake
it
away,вЂќ
Sansa
commanded,
but
the
girl
left
the
food
on
a
table.
She
was
thirsty,
she
realized.
Every
step
sent
knives
through
her
thighs,
but
she
made
herself
cross
the
room.
She
drank
two
cups
of
water,
and
was
nibbling
on
an
olive
when
the
knock
came.

Anxiously,
she
turned
toward
the
door,
smoothed
down
the
folds
of
her
robe.
вЂњYes?вЂќ

The
door
opened,
and
Tyrion
Lannister
stepped
inside.
вЂњMy
lady.
I
trust
I
am
not
disturbing
you?вЂќ

вЂњAm
I
your
prisoner?вЂќ

вЂњMy
guest.вЂќ
He
was
wearing
his
chain
of
office,
a
necklace
of
linked
golden
hands.
вЂњI
thought
we
might
talk.вЂќ

вЂњAs
my
lord
commands.вЂќ
Sansa
found
it
hard
not
to
stare;
his
face
was
so
ugly
it
held
a
queer
fascination
for
her.

вЂњThe
food
and
garments
are
to
your
satisfaction?вЂќ
he
asked.
вЂњIf
there
is
anything
else
you
need,
you
have
only
to
ask.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
most
kind.
And
this
morningвЂ¦
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
help
me.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
a
right
to
know
why
Joffrey
was
so
wroth.
Six
nights
gone,
your
brother
fell
upon
my
uncle
Stafford,
encamped
with
his
host
at
a
village
called
Oxcross
not
three
days
ride
from
Casterly
Rock.
Your
northerners
won
a
crushing
victory.
We
received
word
only
this
morning.вЂќ

Robb
will
kill
you
all,
she
thought,
exulting.
вЂњItвЂ™sвЂ¦
terrible,
my
lord.
My
brother
is
a
vile
traitor.вЂќ

The
dwarf
smiled
wanly.
вЂњWell,
heвЂ™s
no
fawn,
heвЂ™s
made
that
clear
enough.вЂќ

вЂњSer
Lancel
said
Robb
led
an
army
of
wargsвЂ¦вЂќ

The
Imp
gave
a
disdainful
bark
of
laughter.
вЂњSer
LancelвЂ™s
a
wineskin
warrior
who
wouldnвЂ™t
know
a
warg
from
a
wart.
Your
brother
had
his
direwolf
with
him,
but
I
suspect
thatвЂ™s
as
far
as
it
went.
The
northmen
crept
into
my
uncleвЂ™s
camp
and
cut
his
horse
lines,
and
Lord
Stark
sent
his
wolf
among
them.
Even
war-trained
destriers
went
mad.
Knights
were
trampled
to
death
in
their
pavilions,
and
the
rabble
woke
in
terror
and
fled,
casting
aside
their
weapons
to
run
the
faster.
Ser
Stafford
was
slain
as
he
chased
after
a
horse.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
drove
a
lance
through
his
chest.
Ser
Rubert
Brax
is
also
dead,
along
with
Ser
Lymond
Vikary,
Lord
Crakehall,
and
Lord
Jast.
Half
a
hundred
more
have
been
taken
captive,
including
JastвЂ™s
sons
and
my
nephew
Martyn
Lannister.
Those
who
survived
are
spreading
wild
tales
and
swearing
that
the
old
gods
of
the
north
march
with
your
brother.вЂќ

вЂњThenвЂ¦
there
was
no
sorcery?вЂќ

Lannister
snorted.
вЂњSorcery
is
the
sauce
fools
spoon
over
failure
to
hide
the
flavor
of
their
own
incompetence.
My
mutton-headed
uncle
had
not
even
troubled
to
post
sentries,
it
would
seem.
His
host
was
rawвЂ”apprentice
boys,
miners,
fieldhands,
fisherfolk,
the
sweepings
of
Lannisport.
The
only
mystery
is
how
your
brother
reached
him.
Our
forces
still
hold
the
stronghold
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
and
they
swear
he
did
not
pass.вЂќ
The
dwarf
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
вЂњWell,
Robb
Stark
is
my
fatherвЂ™s
bane.
Joffrey
is
mine.
Tell
me,
what
do
you
feel
for
my
kingly
nephew?вЂќ

вЂњI
love
him
with
all
my
heart,вЂќ
Sansa
said
at
once.

вЂњTruly?вЂќ
He
did
not
sound
convinced.
вЂњEven
now?вЂќ

вЂњMy
love
for
His
Grace
is
greater
than
it
has
ever
been.вЂќ

The
Imp
laughed
aloud.
вЂњWell,
someone
has
taught
you
to
lie
well.
You
may
be
grateful
for
that
one
day,
child.
You
are
a
child
still,
are
you
not?
Or
have
you
flowered?вЂќ

Sansa
blushed.
It
was
a
rude
question,
but
the
shame
of
being
stripped
before
half
the
castle
made
it
seem
like
nothing.
вЂњNo,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
all
to
the
good.
If
it
gives
you
any
solace,
I
do
not
intend
that
you
ever
wed
Joffrey.
No
marriage
will
reconcile
Stark
and
Lannister
after
all
that
has
happened,
I
fear.
MoreвЂ™s
the
pity.
The
match
was
one
of
King
RobertвЂ™s
better
notions,
if
Joffrey
hadnвЂ™t
mucked
it
up.вЂќ

She
knew
she
ought
to
say
something,
but
the
words
caught
in
her
throat.

вЂњYou
grow
very
quiet,вЂќ
Tyrion
Lannister
observed.
вЂњIs
this
what
you
want?
An
end
to
your
betrothal?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦вЂќ
Sansa
did
not
know
what
to
say.
Is
it
a
trick?
Will
he
punish
me
if
I
tell
the
truth?
She
stared
at
the
dwarfвЂ™s
brutal
bulging
brow,
the
hard
black
eye
and
the
shrewd
green
one,
the
crooked
teeth
and
wiry
beard.
вЂњI
only
want
to
be
loyal.вЂќ

вЂњLoyal,вЂќ
the
dwarf
mused,
вЂњand
far
from
any
Lannisters.
I
can
scarce
blame
you
for
that.
When
I
was
your
age,
I
wanted
the
same
thing.вЂќ
He
smiled.
вЂњThey
tell
me
you
visit
the
godswood
every
day.
What
do
you
pray
for,
Sansa?вЂќ

I
pray
for
RobbвЂ™s
victory
and
JoffreyвЂ™s
deathвЂ¦
and
for
home.
For
Winterfell.
вЂњI
pray
for
an
end
to
the
fighting.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
have
that
soon
enough.
There
will
be
another
battle,
between
your
brother
Robb
and
my
lord
father,
and
that
will
settle
the
issue.вЂќ

Robb
will
beat
him,
Sansa
thought.
He
beat
your
uncle
and
your
brother
Jaime,
heвЂ™ll
beat
your
father
too.

It
was
as
if
her
face
were
an
open
book,
so
easily
did
the
dwarf
read
her
hopes.
вЂњDo
not
take
Oxcross
too
much
to
heart,
my
lady,вЂќ
he
told
her,
not
unkindly.
вЂњA
battle
is
not
a
war,
and
my
lord
father
is
assuredly
not
my
uncle
Stafford.
The
next
time
you
visit
the
godswood,
pray
that
your
brother
has
the
wisdom
to
bend
the
knee.
Once
the
north
returns
to
the
kingвЂ™s
peace,
I
mean
to
send
you
home.вЂќ
He
hopped
down
off
the
window
seat
and
said,
вЂњYou
may
sleep
here
tonight.
IвЂ™ll
give
you
some
of
my
own
men
as
a
guard,
some
Stone
Crows
perhapsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Sansa
blurted
out,
aghast.
If
she
was
locked
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
guarded
by
the
dwarfвЂ™s
men,
how
would
Ser
Dontos
ever
spirit
her
away
to
freedom?

вЂњWould
you
prefer
Black
Ears?
IвЂ™ll
give
you
Chella
if
a
woman
would
make
you
more
at
ease.вЂќ

вЂњPlease,
no,
my
lord,
the
wildlings
frighten
me.вЂќ

He
grinned.
вЂњMe
as
well.
But
more
to
the
point,
they
frighten
Joffrey
and
that
nest
of
sly
vipers
and
lickspittle
dogs
he
calls
a
Kingsguard.
With
Chella
or
Timett
by
your
side,
no
one
would
dare
offer
you
harm.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
sooner
return
to
my
own
bed.вЂќ
A
lie
came
to
her
suddenly,
but
it
seemed
so
right
that
she
blurted
it
out
at
once.
вЂњThis
tower
was
where
my
fatherвЂ™s
men
were
slain.
Their
ghosts
would
give
me
terrible
dreams,
and
I
would
see
their
blood
wherever
I
looked.вЂќ

Tyrion
Lannister
studied
her
face.
вЂњI
am
no
stranger
to
nightmares,
Sansa.
Perhaps
you
are
wiser
than
I
knew.
Permit
me
at
least
to
escort
you
safely
back
to
your
own
chambers.вЂќ





CATELYN

It
was
full
dark
before
they
found
the
village.
Catelyn
found
herself
wondering
if
the
place
had
a
name.
If
so,
its
people
had
taken
that
knowledge
with
them
when
they
fled,
along
with
all
they
owned,
down
to
the
candles
in
the
sept.
Ser
Wendel
lit
a
torch
and
led
her
through
the
low
door.

Within,
the
seven
walls
were
cracked
and
crooked.
God
is
one,
Septon
Osmynd
had
taught
her
when
she
was
a
girl,
with
seven
aspects,
as
the
sept
is
a
single
building,
with
seven
walls.
The
wealthy
septs
of
the
cities
had
statues
of
the
Seven
and
an
altar
to
each.
In
Winterfell,
Septon
Chayle
hung
carved
masks
from
each
wall.
Here
Catelyn
found
only
rough
charcoal
drawings.
Ser
Wendel
set
the
torch
in
a
sconce
near
the
door,
and
left
to
wait
outside
with
Robar
Royce.

Catelyn
studied
the
faces.
The
Father
was
bearded,
as
ever.
The
Mother
smiled,
loving
and
protective.
The
Warrior
had
his
sword
sketched
in
beneath
his
face,
the
Smith
his
hammer.
The
Maid
was
beautiful,
the
Crone
wizened
and
wise.

And
the
seventh
faceвЂ¦
the
Stranger
was
neither
male
nor
female,
yet
both,
ever
the
outcast,
the
wanderer
from
far
places,
less
and
more
than
human,
unknown
and
unknowable.
Here
the
face
was
a
black
oval,
a
shadow
with
stars
for
eyes.
It
made
Catelyn
uneasy.
She
would
get
scant
comfort
there.

She
knelt
before
the
Mother.
вЂњMy
lady,
look
down
on
this
battle
with
a
motherвЂ™s
eyes.
They
are
all
sons,
every
one.
Spare
them
if
you
can,
and
spare
my
own
sons
as
well.
Watch
over
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon.
Would
that
I
were
with
them.вЂќ

A
crack
ran
down
through
the
MotherвЂ™s
left
eye.
It
made
her
look
as
if
she
were
crying.
Catelyn
could
hear
Ser
WendelвЂ™s
booming
voice,
and
now
and
again
Ser
RobarвЂ™s
quiet
answers,
as
they
talked
of
the
coming
battle.
Otherwise
the
night
was
still.
Not
even
a
cricket
could
be
heard,
and
the
gods
kept
their
silence.
Did
your
old
gods
ever
answer
you,
Ned?
she
wondered.
When
you
knelt
before
your
heart
tree,
did
they
hear
you?

Flickering
torchlight
danced
across
the
walls,
making
the
faces
seem
half
alive,
twisting
them,
changing
them.
The
statues
in
the
great
septs
of
the
cities
wore
the
faces
the
stonemasons
had
given
them,
but
these
charcoal
scratchings
were
so
crude
they
might
be
anyone.
The
FatherвЂ™s
face
made
her
think
of
her
own
father,
dying
in
his
bed
at
Riverrun.
The
Warrior
was
Renly
and
Stannis,
Robb
and
Robert,
Jaime
Lannister
and
Jon
Snow.
She
even
glimpsed
Arya
in
those
lines,
just
for
an
instant.
Then
a
gust
of
wind
through
the
door
made
the
torch
sputter,
and
the
semblance
was
gone,
washed
away
in
orange
glare.

The
smoke
was
making
her
eyes
burn.
She
rubbed
at
them
with
the
heels
of
her
scarred
hands.
When
she
looked
up
at
the
Mother
again,
it
was
her
own
mother
she
saw.
Lady
Minisa
Tully
had
died
in
childbed,
trying
to
give
Lord
Hoster
a
second
son.
The
baby
had
perished
with
her,
and
afterward
some
of
the
life
had
gone
out
of
Father.
She
was
always
so
calm,
Catelyn
thought,
remembering
her
motherвЂ™s
soft
hands,
her
warm
smile.
If
she
had
lived,
how
different
our
lives
might
have
been.
She
wondered
what
Lady
Minisa
would
make
of
her
eldest
daughter,
kneeling
here
before
her.
I
have
come
so
many
thousands
of
leagues,
and
for
what?
Who
have
I
served?
I
have
lost
my
daughters,
Robb
does
not
want
me,
and
Bran
and
Rickon
must
surely
think
me
a
cold
and
unnatural
mother.
I
was
not
even
with
Ned
when
he
diedвЂ¦

Her
head
swam,
and
the
sept
seemed
to
move
around
her.
The
shadows
swayed
and
shifted,
furtive
animals
racing
across
the
cracked
white
walls.
Catelyn
had
not
eaten
today.
Perhaps
that
had
been
unwise.
She
told
herself
that
there
had
been
no
time,
but
the
truth
was
that
food
had
lost
its
savor
in
a
world
without
Ned.
When
they
took
his
head
off,
they
killed
me
too.

Behind
her
the
torch
spit,
and
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
her
sisterвЂ™s
face
on
the
wall,
though
the
eyes
were
harder
than
she
recalled,
not
LysaвЂ™s
eyes
but
CerseiвЂ™s.
Cersei
is
a
mother
too.
No
matter
who
fathered
those
children,
she
felt
them
kick
inside
her,
brought
them
forth
with
her
pain
and
blood,
nursed
them
at
her
breast.
If
they
are
truly
JaimeвЂ™sвЂ¦

вЂњDoes
Cersei
pray
to
you
too,
my
lady?вЂќ
Catelyn
asked
the
Mother.
She
could
see
the
proud,
cold,
lovely
features
of
the
Lannister
queen
etched
upon
the
wall.
The
crack
was
still
there;
even
Cersei
could
weep
for
her
children.
вЂњEach
of
the
Seven
embodies
all
of
the
Seven,вЂќ
Septon
Osmynd
had
told
her
once.
There
was
as
much
beauty
in
the
Crone
as
in
the
Maiden,
and
the
Mother
could
be
fiercer
than
the
Warrior
when
her
children
were
in
danger.
YesвЂ¦

She
had
seen
enough
of
Robert
Baratheon
at
Winterfell
to
know
that
the
king
did
not
regard
Joffrey
with
any
great
warmth.
If
the
boy
was
truly
JaimeвЂ™s
seed,
Robert
would
have
put
him
to
death
along
with
his
mother,
and
few
would
have
condemned
him.
Bastards
were
common
enough,
but
incest
was
a
monstrous
sin
to
both
old
gods
and
new,
and
the
children
of
such
wickedness
were
named
abominations
in
sept
and
godswood
alike.
The
dragon
kings
had
wed
brother
to
sister,
but
they
were
the
blood
of
old
Valyria
where
such
practices
had
been
common,
and
like
their
dragons
the
Targaryens
answered
to
neither
gods
nor
men.

Ned
must
have
known,
and
Lord
Arryn
before
him.
Small
wonder
that
the
queen
had
killed
them
both.
Would
I
do
any
less
for
my
own?
Catelyn
clenched
her
hands,
feeling
the
tightness
in
her
scarred
fingers
where
the
assassinвЂ™s
steel
had
cut
to
the
bone
as
she
fought
to
save
her
son.
вЂњBran
knows
too,вЂќ
she
whispered,
lowering
her
head.
Gods
be
good,
he
must
have
seen
something,
heard
something,
that
was
why
they
tried
to
kill
him
in
his
bed.

Lost
and
weary,
Catelyn
Stark
gave
herself
over
to
her
gods.
She
knelt
before
the
Smith,
who
fixed
things
that
were
broken,
and
asked
that
he
give
her
sweet
Bran
his
protection.
She
went
to
the
Maid
and
beseeched
her
to
lend
her
courage
to
Arya
and
Sansa,
to
guard
them
in
their
innocence.
To
the
Father,
she
prayed
for
justice,
the
strength
to
seek
it
and
the
wisdom
to
know
it,
and
she
asked
the
Warrior
to
keep
Robb
strong
and
shield
him
in
his
battles.
Lastly
she
turned
to
the
Crone,
whose
statues
often
showed
her
with
a
lamp
in
one
hand.
вЂњGuide
me,
wise
lady,вЂќ
she
prayed.
вЂњShow
me
the
path
I
must
walk,
and
do
not
let
me
stumble
in
the
dark
places
that
lie
ahead.вЂќ

Finally
there
were
footsteps
behind
her,
and
a
noise
at
the
door.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Robar
said
gently,
вЂњpardon,
but
our
time
is
at
an
end.
We
must
be
back
before
the
dawn
breaks.вЂќ

Catelyn
rose
stiffly.
Her
knees
ached,
and
she
would
have
given
much
for
a
featherbed
and
a
pillow
just
then.
вЂњThank
you,
ser.
I
am
ready.вЂќ

They
rode
in
silence
through
sparse
woodland
where
the
trees
leaned
drunkenly
away
from
the
sea.
The
nervous
whinny
of
horses
and
the
clank
of
steel
guided
them
back
to
RenlyвЂ™s
camp.
The
long
ranks
of
man
and
horse
were
armored
in
darkness,
as
black
as
if
the
Smith
had
hammered
night
itself
into
steel.
There
were
banners
to
her
right,
banners
to
her
left,
and
rank
on
rank
of
banners
before
her,
but
in
the
predawn
gloom,
neither
colors
nor
sigils
could
be
discerned.
A
grey
army,
Catelyn
thought.
Grey
men
on
grey
horses
beneath
grey
banners.
As
they
sat
their
horses
waiting,
RenlyвЂ™s
shadow
knights
pointed
their
lances
upward,
so
she
rode
through
a
forest
of
tall
naked
trees,
bereft
of
leaves
and
life.
Where
StormвЂ™s
End
stood
was
only
a
deeper
darkness,
a
wall
of
black
through
which
no
stars
could
shine,
but
she
could
see
torches
moving
across
the
fields
where
Lord
Stannis
had
made
his
camp.

The
candles
within
RenlyвЂ™s
pavilion
made
the
shimmering
silken
walls
seem
to
glow,
transforming
the
great
tent
into
a
magical
castle
alive
with
emerald
light.
Two
of
the
Rainbow
Guard
stood
sentry
at
the
door
to
the
royal
pavilion.
The
green
light
shone
strangely
against
the
purple
plums
of
Ser
ParmenвЂ™s
surcoat,
and
gave
a
sickly
hue
to
the
sunflowers
that
covered
every
inch
of
Ser
EmmonвЂ™s
enameled
yellow
plate.
Long
silken
plumes
flew
from
their
helms,
and
rainbow
cloaks
draped
their
shoulders.

Within,
Catelyn
found
Brienne
armoring
the
king
for
battle
while
the
Lords
Tarly
and
Rowan
spoke
of
dispositions
and
tactics.
It
was
pleasantly
warm
inside,
the
heat
shimmering
off
the
coals
in
a
dozen
small
iron
braziers.
вЂњI
must
speak
with
you,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
she
said,
granting
him
a
kingвЂ™s
style
for
once,
anything
to
make
him
heed
her.

вЂњIn
a
moment,
Lady
Catelyn,вЂќ
Renly
replied.
Brienne
fit
backplate
to
breastplate
over
his
quilted
tunic.
The
kingвЂ™s
armor
was
a
deep
green,
the
green
of
leaves
in
a
summer
wood,
so
dark
it
drank
the
candlelight.
Gold
highlights
gleamed
from
inlay
and
fastenings
like
distant
fires
in
that
wood,
winking
every
time
he
moved.
вЂњPray
continue,
Lord
Mathis.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Mathis
Rowan
said
with
a
sideways
glance
at
Catelyn.
вЂњAs
I
was
saying,
our
battles
are
well
drawn
up.
Why
wait
for
daybreak?
Sound
the
advance.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
have
it
said
that
I
won
by
treachery,
with
an
unchivalrous
attack?
Dawn
was
the
chosen
hour.вЂќ

вЂњChosen
by
Stannis,вЂќ
Randyll
Tarly
pointed
out.
вЂњHeвЂ™d
have
us
charge
into
the
teeth
of
the
rising
sun.
WeвЂ™ll
be
half-blind.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
until
first
shock,вЂќ
Renly
said
confidently.
вЂњSer
Loras
will
break
them,
and
after
that
it
will
be
chaos.вЂќ
Brienne
tightened
green
leather
straps
and
buckled
golden
buckles.
вЂњWhen
my
brother
falls,
see
that
no
insult
is
done
to
his
corpse.
He
is
my
own
blood,
I
will
not
have
his
head
paraded
about
on
a
spear.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
he
yields?вЂќ
Lord
Tarly
asked.

вЂњYields?вЂќ
Lord
Rowan
laughed.
вЂњWhen
Mace
Tyrell
laid
siege
to
StormвЂ™s
End,
Stannis
ate
rats
rather
than
open
his
gates.вЂќ

вЂњWell
I
remember.вЂќ
Renly
lifted
his
chin
to
allow
Brienne
to
fasten
his
gorget
in
place.
вЂњNear
the
end,
Ser
Gawen
Wylde
and
three
of
his
knights
tried
to
steal
out
a
postern
gate
to
surrender.
Stannis
caught
them
and
ordered
them
flung
from
the
walls
with
catapults.
I
can
still
see
GawenвЂ™s
face
as
they
strapped
him
down.
He
had
been
our
master-at-arms.вЂќ

Lord
Rowan
appeared
puzzled.
вЂњNo
men
were
hurled
from
the
walls.
I
would
surely
remember
that.вЂќ

вЂњMaester
Cressen
told
Stannis
that
we
might
be
forced
to
eat
our
dead,
and
there
was
no
gain
in
flinging
away
good
meat.вЂќ
Renly
pushed
back
his
hair.
Brienne
bound
it
with
a
velvet
tie
and
pulled
a
padded
cap
down
over
his
ears,
to
cushion
the
weight
of
his
helm.
вЂњThanks
to
the
Onion
Knight
we
were
never
reduced
to
dining
on
corpses,
but
it
was
a
close
thing.
Too
close
for
Ser
Gawen,
who
died
in
his
cell.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
Catelyn
had
waited
patiently,
but
time
grew
short.
вЂњYou
promised
me
a
word.вЂќ

Renly
nodded.
вЂњSee
to
your
battles,
my
lordsвЂ¦
oh,
and
if
Barristan
Selmy
is
at
my
brotherвЂ™s
side,
I
want
him
spared.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
been
no
word
of
Ser
Barristan
since
Joffrey
cast
him
out,вЂќ
Lord
Rowan
objected.

вЂњI
know
that
old
man.
He
needs
a
king
to
guard,
or
who
is
he?
Yet
he
never
came
to
me,
and
Lady
Catelyn
says
he
is
not
with
Robb
Stark
at
Riverrun.
Where
else
but
with
Stannis?вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
Your
Grace.
No
harm
will
come
to
him.вЂќ
The
lords
bowed
deeply
and
departed.

вЂњSay
your
say,
Lady
Stark,вЂќ
Renly
said.
Brienne
swept
his
cloak
over
his
broad
shoulders.
It
was
cloth-of-gold,
heavy,
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
picked
out
in
flakes
of
jet.

вЂњThe
Lannisters
tried
to
kill
my
son
Bran.
A
thousand
times
I
have
asked
myself
why.
Your
brother
gave
me
my
answer.
There
was
a
hunt
the
day
he
fell.
Robert
and
Ned
and
most
of
the
other
men
rode
out
after
boar,
but
Jaime
Lannister
remained
at
Winterfell,
as
did
the
queen.вЂќ

Renly
was
not
slow
to
take
the
implication.
вЂњSo
you
believe
the
boy
caught
them
at
their
incestвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
beg
you,
my
lord,
grant
me
leave
to
go
to
your
brother
Stannis
and
tell
him
what
I
suspect.вЂќ

вЂњTo
what
end?вЂќ

вЂњRobb
will
set
aside
his
crown
if
you
and
your
brother
will
do
the
same,вЂќ
she
said,
hoping
it
was
true.
She
would
make
it
true
if
she
must;
Robb
would
listen
to
her,
even
if
his
lords
would
not.
вЂњLet
the
three
of
you
call
for
a
Great
Council,
such
as
the
realm
has
not
seen
for
a
hundred
years.
We
will
send
to
Winterfell,
so
Bran
may
tell
his
tale
and
all
men
may
know
the
Lannisters
for
the
true
usurpers.
Let
the
assembled
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
choose
who
shall
rule
them.вЂќ

Renly
laughed.
вЂњTell
me,
my
lady,
do
direwolves
vote
on
who
should
lead
the
pack?вЂќ
Brienne
brought
the
kingвЂ™s
gauntlets
and
greathelm,
crowned
with
golden
antlers
that
would
add
a
foot
and
a
half
to
his
height.
вЂњThe
time
for
talk
is
done.
Now
we
see
who
is
stronger.вЂќ
Renly
pulled
a
lobstered
green-and-gold
gauntlet
over
his
left
hand,
while
Brienne
knelt
to
buckle
on
his
belt,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
longsword
and
dagger.

вЂњI
beg
you
in
the
name
of
the
Mother,вЂќ
Catelyn
began
when
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
flung
open
the
door
of
the
tent.
She
thought
she
glimpsed
movement,
but
when
she
turned
her
head,
it
was
only
the
kingвЂ™s
shadow
shifting
against
the
silken
walls.
She
heard
Renly
begin
a
jest,
his
shadow
moving,
lifting
its
sword,
black
on
green,
candles
guttering,
shivering,
something
was
queer,
wrong,
and
then
she
saw
RenlyвЂ™s
sword
still
in
its
scabbard,
sheathed
still,
but
the
shadowswordвЂ¦

вЂњCold,вЂќ
said
Renly
in
a
small
puzzled
voice,
a
heartbeat
before
the
steel
of
his
gorget
parted
like
cheesecloth
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
blade
that
was
not
there.
He
had
time
to
make
a
small
thick
gasp
before
the
blood
came
gushing
out
of
his
throat.

вЂњYour
GrвЂ”no!вЂќ
cried
Brienne
the
Blue
when
she
saw
that
evil
flow,
sounding
as
scared
as
any
little
girl.
The
king
stumbled
into
her
arms,
a
sheet
of
blood
creeping
down
the
front
of
his
armor,
a
dark
red
tide
that
drowned
his
green
and
gold.
More
candles
guttered
out.
Renly
tried
to
speak,
but
he
was
choking
on
his
own
blood.
His
legs
collapsed,
and
only
BrienneвЂ™s
strength
held
him
up.
She
threw
back
her
head
and
screamed,
wordless
in
her
anguish.

The
shadow.
Something
dark
and
evil
had
happened
here,
she
knew,
something
that
she
could
not
begin
to
understand.
Renly
never
cast
that
shadow.
Death
came
in
that
door
and
blew
the
life
out
of
him
as
swift
as
the
wind
snuffed
out
his
candles.

Only
a
few
instants
passed
before
Robar
Royce
and
Emmon
Cuy
came
bursting
in,
though
it
felt
like
half
the
night.
A
pair
of
men-at-arms
crowded
in
behind
with
torches.
When
they
saw
Renly
in
BrienneвЂ™s
arms,
and
her
drenched
with
the
kingвЂ™s
blood,
Ser
Robar
gave
a
cry
of
horror.
вЂњWicked
woman!вЂќ
screamed
Ser
Emmon,
he
of
the
sunflowered
steel.
вЂњAway
from
him,
you
vile
creature!вЂќ

вЂњGods
be
good,
Brienne,
why?вЂќ
asked
Ser
Robar.

Brienne
looked
up
from
her
kingвЂ™s
body.
The
rainbow
cloak
that
hung
from
her
shoulders
had
turned
red
where
the
kingвЂ™s
blood
had
soaked
into
the
cloth.
вЂњIвЂ¦
IвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
die
for
this.вЂќ
Ser
Emmon
snatched
up
a
long-handled
battleaxe
from
the
weapons
piled
near
the
door.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
pay
for
the
kingвЂ™s
life
with
your
own!вЂќ

вЂњNO!вЂќ
Catelyn
Stark
screamed,
finding
her
voice
at
last,
but
it
was
too
late,
the
blood
madness
was
on
them,
and
they
rushed
forward
with
shouts
that
drowned
her
softer
words.

Brienne
moved
faster
than
Catelyn
would
have
believed.
Her
own
sword
was
not
to
hand,
so
she
snatched
RenlyвЂ™s
from
its
scabbard
and
raised
it
to
catch
EmmonвЂ™s
axe
on
the
downswing.
A
spark
flashed
blue-white
as
steel
met
steel
with
a
rending
crash,
and
Brienne
sprang
to
her
feet,
the
body
of
the
dead
king
thrust
rudely
aside.
Ser
Emmon
stumbled
over
it
as
he
tried
to
close,
and
BrienneвЂ™s
blade
sheared
through
the
wooden
haft
to
send
his
axehead
spinning.
Another
man
thrust
a
flaming
torch
at
her
back,
but
the
rainbow
cloak
was
too
sodden
with
blood
to
burn.
Brienne
spun
and
cut,
and
torch
and
hand
went
flying.
Flames
crept
across
the
carpet.
The
maimed
man
began
to
scream.
Ser
Emmon
dropped
the
axe
and
fumbled
for
his
sword.
The
second
man-at-arms
lunged,
Brienne
parried,
and
their
swords
danced
and
clanged
against
each
other.
When
Emmon
Cuy
came
wading
back
in,
Brienne
was
forced
to
retreat,
yet
somehow
she
held
them
both
at
bay.
On
the
ground,
RenlyвЂ™s
head
rolled
sickeningly
to
one
side,
and
a
second
mouth
yawned
wide,
the
blood
coming
from
him
now
in
slow
pulses.

Ser
Robar
had
hung
back,
uncertain,
but
now
he
was
reaching
for
his
hilt.
вЂњRobar,
no,
listen.вЂќ
Catelyn
seized
his
arm.
вЂњYou
do
her
wrong,
it
was
not
her.
Help
her!
Hear
me,
it
was
Stannis.вЂќ
The
name
was
on
her
lips
before
she
could
think
how
it
got
there,
but
as
she
said
it,
she
knew
that
it
was
true.
вЂњI
swear
it,
you
know
me,
it
was
Stannis
killed
him.вЂќ

The
young
rainbow
knight
stared
at
this
madwoman
with
pale
and
frightened
eyes.
вЂњStannis?
How?вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
know.
Sorcery,
some
dark
magic,
there
was
a
shadow,
a
shadow.вЂќ
Her
own
voice
sounded
wild
and
crazed
to
her,
but
the
words
poured
out
in
a
rush
as
the
blades
continued
to
clash
behind
her.
вЂњA
shadow
with
a
sword,
I
swear
it,
I
saw.
Are
you
blind,
the
girl
loved
him!
Help
her!вЂќ
She
glanced
back,
saw
the
second
guardsman
fall,
his
blade
dropping
from
limp
fingers.
Outside
there
was
shouting.
More
angry
men
would
be
bursting
in
on
them
any
instant,
she
knew.
вЂњShe
is
innocent,
Robar.
You
have
my
word,
on
my
husbandвЂ™s
grave
and
my
honor
as
a
Stark!вЂќ

That
resolved
him.
вЂњI
will
hold
them,вЂќ
Ser
Robar
said.
вЂњGet
her
away.вЂќ
He
turned
and
went
out.

The
fire
had
reached
the
wall
and
was
creeping
up
the
side
of
the
tent.
Ser
Emmon
was
pressing
Brienne
hard,
him
in
his
enameled
yellow
steel
and
her
in
wool.
He
had
forgotten
Catelyn,
until
the
iron
brazier
came
crashing
into
the
back
of
his
head.
Helmed
as
he
was,
the
blow
did
no
lasting
harm,
but
it
sent
him
to
his
knees.
вЂњBrienne,
with
me,вЂќ
Catelyn
commanded.
The
girl
was
not
slow
to
see
the
chance.
A
slash,
and
the
green
silk
parted.
They
stepped
out
into
darkness
and
the
chill
of
dawn.
Loud
voices
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
pavilion.
вЂњThis
way,вЂќ
Catelyn
urged,
вЂњand
slowly.
We
must
not
run,
or
they
will
ask
why.
Walk
easy,
as
if
nothing
were
amiss.вЂќ

Brienne
thrust
her
sword
blade
through
her
belt
and
fell
in
beside
Catelyn.
The
night
air
smelled
of
rain.
Behind
them,
the
kingвЂ™s
pavilion
was
well
ablaze,
flames
rising
high
against
the
dark.
No
one
made
any
move
to
stop
them.
Men
rushed
past
them,
shouting
of
fire
and
murder
and
sorcery.
Others
stood
in
small
groups
and
spoke
in
low
voices.
A
few
were
praying,
and
one
young
squire
was
on
his
knees,
sobbing
openly.

RenlyвЂ™s
battles
were
already
coming
apart
as
the
rumors
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth.
The
nightfires
had
burned
low,
and
as
the
east
began
to
lighten
the
immense
mass
of
StormвЂ™s
End
emerged
like
a
dream
of
stone
while
wisps
of
pale
mist
raced
across
the
field,
flying
from
the
sun
on
wings
of
wind.
Morning
ghosts,
she
had
heard
Old
Nan
call
them
once,
spirits
returning
to
their
graves.
And
Renly
one
of
them
now,
gone
like
his
brother
Robert,
like
her
own
dear
Ned.

вЂњI
never
held
him
but
as
he
died,вЂќ
Brienne
said
quietly
as
they
walked
through
the
spreading
chaos.
Her
voice
sounded
as
if
she
might
break
at
any
instant.
вЂњHe
was
laughing
one
moment,
and
suddenly
the
blood
was
everywhereвЂ¦
my
lady,
I
do
not
understand.
Did
you
see,
did
youвЂ¦?вЂќ

вЂњI
saw
a
shadow.
I
thought
it
was
RenlyвЂ™s
shadow
at
the
first,
but
it
was
his
brotherвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Stannis?вЂќ

вЂњI
felt
him.
It
makes
no
sense,
I
knowвЂ¦вЂќ

It
made
sense
enough
for
Brienne.
вЂњI
will
kill
him,вЂќ
the
tall
homely
girl
declared.
вЂњWith
my
lordвЂ™s
own
sword,
I
will
kill
him.
I
swear
it.
I
swear
it.
I
swear
it.вЂќ

Hal
Mollen
and
the
rest
of
her
escort
were
waiting
with
the
horses.
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
was
all
in
a
lather
to
know
what
was
happening.
вЂњMy
lady,
the
camp
has
gone
mad,вЂќ
he
blurted
when
he
saw
them.
вЂњLord
Renly,
is
heвЂ”вЂќ
He
stopped
suddenly,
staring
at
Brienne
and
the
blood
that
drenched
her.

вЂњDead,
but
not
by
our
hands.вЂќ

вЂњThe
battleвЂ”вЂќ
Hal
Mollen
began.

вЂњThere
will
be
no
battle.вЂќ
Catelyn
mounted,
and
her
escort
formed
up
about
her,
with
Ser
Wendel
to
her
left
and
Ser
Perwyn
Frey
on
her
right.
вЂњBrienne,
we
brought
mounts
enough
for
twice
our
number.
Choose
one,
and
come
with
us.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
my
own
horse,
my
lady.
And
my
armorвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњLeave
them.
We
must
be
well
away
before
they
think
to
look
for
us.
We
were
both
with
the
king
when
he
was
killed.
That
will
not
be
forgotten.вЂќ
Wordless,
Brienne
turned
and
did
as
she
was
bid.
вЂњRide,вЂќ
Catelyn
commanded
her
escort
when
they
were
all
ahorse.
вЂњIf
any
man
tries
to
stop
us,
cut
him
down.вЂќ

As
the
long
fingers
of
dawn
fanned
across
the
fields,
color
was
returning
to
the
world.
Where
grey
men
had
sat
grey
horses
armed
with
shadow
spears,
the
points
of
ten
thousand
lances
now
glinted
silverly
cold,
and
on
the
myriad
flapping
banners
Catelyn
saw
the
blush
of
red
and
pink
and
orange,
the
richness
of
blues
and
browns,
the
blaze
of
gold
and
yellow.
All
the
power
of
StormвЂ™s
End
and
Highgarden,
the
power
that
had
been
RenlyвЂ™s
an
hour
ago.
They
belong
to
Stannis
now,
she
realized,
even
if
they
do
not
know
it
themselves
yet.
Where
else
are
they
to
turn,
if
not
to
the
last
Baratheon?
Stannis
has
won
all
with
a
single
evil
stroke.

I
am
the
rightful
king,
he
had
declared,
his
jaw
clenched
hard
as
iron,
and
your
son
no
less
a
traitor
than
my
brother
here.
His
day
will
come
as
well.

A
chill
went
through
her.





JON

The
hill
jutted
above
the
dense
tangle
of
forest,
rising
solitary
and
sudden,
its
windswept
heights
visible
from
miles
off.
The
wildlings
called
it
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men,
rangers
said.
It
did
look
like
a
fist,
Jon
Snow
thought,
punching
up
through
earth
and
wood,
its
bare
brown
slopes
knuckled
with
stone.

He
rode
to
the
top
with
Lord
Mormont
and
the
officers,
leaving
Ghost
below
under
the
trees.
The
direwolf
had
run
off
three
times
as
they
climbed,
twice
returning
reluctantly
to
JonвЂ™s
whistle.
The
third
time,
the
Lord
Commander
lost
patience
and
snapped,
вЂњLet
him
go,
boy.
I
want
to
reach
the
crest
before
dusk.
Find
the
wolf
later.вЂќ

The
way
up
was
steep
and
stony,
the
summit
crowned
by
a
chest-high
wall
of
tumbled
rocks.
They
had
to
circle
some
distance
west
before
they
found
a
gap
large
enough
to
admit
the
horses.
вЂњThis
is
good
ground,
Thoren,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
proclaimed
when
at
last
they
attained
the
top.
вЂњWe
could
scarce
hope
for
better.
WeвЂ™ll
make
our
camp
here
to
await
Halfhand.вЂќ
The
Lord
Commander
swung
down
off
his
saddle,
dislodging
the
raven
from
his
shoulder.
Complaining
loudly,
the
bird
took
to
the
air.

The
views
atop
the
hill
were
bracing,
yet
it
was
the
ringwall
that
drew
JonвЂ™s
eye,
the
weathered
grey
stones
with
their
white
patches
of
lichen,
their
beards
of
green
moss.
It
was
said
that
the
Fist
had
been
a
ringfort
of
the
First
Men
in
the
Dawn
Age.
вЂњAn
old
place,
and
strong,вЂќ
Thoren
Smallwood
said.

вЂњOld,вЂќ
MormontвЂ™s
raven
screamed
as
it
flapped
in
noisy
circles
about
their
heads.
вЂњOld,
old,
old.вЂќ

вЂњQuiet,вЂќ
Mormont
growled
up
at
the
bird.
The
Old
Bear
was
too
proud
to
admit
to
weakness,
but
Jon
was
not
deceived.
The
strain
of
keeping
up
with
younger
men
was
taking
its
toll.

вЂњThese
heights
will
be
easy
to
defend,
if
need
be,вЂќ
Thoren
pointed
out
as
he
walked
his
horse
along
the
ring
of
stones,
his
sable-trimmed
cloak
stirring
in
the
wind.

вЂњYes,
this
place
will
do.вЂќ
The
Old
Bear
lifted
a
hand
to
the
wind,
and
raven
landed
on
his
forearm,
claws
scrabbling
against
his
black
ringmail.

вЂњWhat
about
water,
my
lord?вЂќ
Jon
wondered.

вЂњWe
crossed
a
brook
at
the
foot
of
the
hill.вЂќ

вЂњA
long
climb
for
a
drink,вЂќ
Jon
pointed
out,
вЂњand
outside
the
ring
of
stones.вЂќ

Thoren
said,
вЂњAre
you
too
lazy
to
climb
a
hill,
boy?вЂќ

When
Lord
Mormont
said,
вЂњWeвЂ™re
not
like
to
find
another
place
as
strong.
WeвЂ™ll
carry
water,
and
make
certain
we
are
well
supplied,вЂќ
Jon
knew
better
than
to
argue.
So
the
command
was
given,
and
the
brothers
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
raised
their
camp
behind
the
stone
ring
the
First
Men
had
made.
Black
tents
sprouted
like
mushrooms
after
a
rain,
and
blankets
and
bedrolls
covered
the
bare
ground.
Stewards
tethered
the
garrons
in
long
lines,
and
saw
them
fed
and
watered.
Foresters
took
their
axes
to
the
trees
in
the
waning
afternoon
light
to
harvest
enough
wood
to
see
them
through
the
night.
A
score
of
builders
set
to
clearing
brush,
digging
latrines,
and
untying
their
bundles
of
fire-hardened
stakes.
вЂњI
will
have
every
opening
in
the
ringwall
ditched
and
staked
before
dark,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
had
commanded.

Once
heвЂ™d
put
up
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
tent
and
seen
to
their
horses,
Jon
Snow
descended
the
hill
in
search
of
Ghost.
The
direwolf
came
at
once,
all
in
silence.
One
moment
Jon
was
striding
beneath
the
trees,
whistling
and
shouting,
alone
in
the
green,
pinecones
and
fallen
leaves
under
his
feet;
the
next,
the
great
white
direwolf
was
walking
beside
him,
pale
as
morning
mist.

But
when
they
reached
the
ringfort,
Ghost
balked
again.
He
padded
forward
warily
to
sniff
at
the
gap
in
the
stones,
and
then
retreated,
as
if
he
did
not
like
what
heвЂ™d
smelled.
Jon
tried
to
grab
him
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
haul
him
bodily
inside
the
ring,
no
easy
task;
the
wolf
weighed
as
much
as
he
did,
and
was
stronger
by
far.
вЂњGhost,
whatвЂ™s
wrong
with
you?вЂќ
It
was
not
like
him
to
be
so
unsettled.
In
the
end
Jon
had
to
give
it
up.
вЂњAs
you
will,вЂќ
he
told
the
wolf.
вЂњGo,
hunt.вЂќ
The
red
eyes
watched
him
as
he
made
his
way
back
through
the
mossy
stones.

They
ought
to
be
safe
here.
The
hill
offered
commanding
views,
and
the
slopes
were
precipitous
to
the
north
and
west
and
only
slightly
more
gentle
to
the
east.
Yet
as
the
dusk
deepened
and
darkness
seeped
into
the
hollows
between
the
trees,
JonвЂ™s
sense
of
foreboding
grew.
This
is
the
haunted
forest,
he
told
himself.
Maybe
there
are
ghosts
here,
the
spirits
of
the
First
Men.
This
was
their
place,
once.

вЂњStop
acting
the
boy,вЂќ
he
told
himself.
Clambering
atop
the
piled
rocks,
Jon
gazed
off
toward
the
setting
sun.
He
could
see
the
light
shimmering
like
hammered
gold
off
the
surface
of
the
Milkwater
as
it
curved
away
to
the
south.
Upriver
the
land
was
more
rugged,
the
dense
forest
giving
way
to
a
series
of
bare
stony
hills
that
rose
high
and
wild
to
the
north
and
west.
On
the
horizon
stood
the
mountains
like
a
great
shadow,
range
on
range
of
them
receding
into
the
blue-grey
distance,
their
jagged
peaks
sheathed
eternally
in
snow.
Even
from
afar
they
looked
vast
and
cold
and
inhospitable.

Closer
at
hand,
it
was
the
trees
that
ruled.
To
south
and
east
the
wood
went
on
as
far
as
Jon
could
see,
a
vast
tangle
of
root
and
limb
painted
in
a
thousand
shades
of
green,
with
here
and
there
a
patch
of
red
where
a
weirwood
shouldered
through
the
pines
and
sentinels,
or
a
blush
of
yellow
where
some
broadleafs
had
begun
to
turn.
When
the
wind
blew,
he
could
hear
the
creak
and
groan
of
branches
older
than
he
was.
A
thousand
leaves
fluttered,
and
for
a
moment
the
forest
seemed
a
deep
green
sea,
storm-tossed
and
heaving,
eternal
and
unknowable.

Ghost
was
not
like
to
be
alone
down
there,
he
thought.
Anything
could
be
moving
under
that
sea,
creeping
toward
the
ringfort
through
the
dark
of
the
wood,
concealed
beneath
those
trees.
Anything.
How
would
they
ever
know?
He
stood
there
for
a
long
time,
until
the
sun
vanished
behind
the
saw-toothed
mountains
and
darkness
began
to
creep
through
the
forest.

вЂњJon?вЂќ
Samwell
Tarly
called
up.
вЂњI
thought
it
looked
like
you.
Are
you
well?вЂќ

вЂњWell
enough.вЂќ
Jon
hopped
down.
вЂњHow
did
you
fare
today?вЂќ

вЂњWell.
I
fared
well.
Truly.вЂќ

Jon
was
not
about
to
share
his
disquiet
with
his
friend,
not
when
Samwell
Tarly
was
at
last
beginning
to
find
his
courage.
вЂњThe
Old
Bear
means
to
wait
here
for
Qhorin
Halfhand
and
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower.вЂќ

вЂњIt
seems
a
strong
place,вЂќ
said
Sam.
вЂњA
ringfort
of
the
First
Men.
Do
you
think
there
were
battles
fought
here?вЂќ

вЂњNo
doubt.
YouвЂ™d
best
get
a
bird
ready.
Mormont
will
want
to
send
back
word.вЂќ

вЂњI
wish
I
could
send
them
all.
They
hate
being
caged.вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
too,
if
you
could
fly.вЂќ

вЂњIf
I
could
fly,
IвЂ™d
be
back
at
Castle
Black
eating
a
pork
pie,вЂќ
said
Sam.

Jon
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
with
his
burned
hand.
They
walked
back
through
the
camp
together.
Cookfires
were
being
lit
all
around
them.
Overhead,
the
stars
were
coming
out.
The
long
red
tail
of
MormontвЂ™s
Torch
burned
as
bright
as
the
moon.
Jon
heard
the
ravens
before
he
saw
them.
Some
were
calling
his
name.
The
birds
were
not
shy
when
it
came
to
making
noise.

They
feel
it
too.
вЂњIвЂ™d
best
see
to
the
Old
Bear,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњHe
gets
noisy
when
he
isnвЂ™t
fed
as
well.вЂќ

He
found
Mormont
talking
with
Thoren
Smallwood
and
half
a
dozen
other
officers.
вЂњThere
you
are,вЂќ
the
old
man
said
gruffly.
вЂњBring
us
some
hot
wine,
if
you
would.
The
night
is
chilly.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lord.вЂќ
Jon
built
a
cookfire,
claimed
a
small
cask
of
MormontвЂ™s
favorite
robust
red
from
stores,
and
poured
it
into
a
kettle.
He
hung
the
kettle
above
the
flames
while
he
gathered
the
rest
of
his
ingredients.
The
Old
Bear
was
particular
about
his
hot
spiced
wine.
So
much
cinnamon
and
so
much
nutmeg
and
so
much
honey,
not
a
drop
more.
Raisins
and
nuts
and
dried
berries,
but
no
lemon,
that
was
the
rankest
sort
of
southron
heresyвЂ”which
was
queer,
since
he
always
took
lemon
in
his
morning
beer.
The
drink
must
be
hot
to
warm
a
man
properly,
the
Lord
Commander
insisted,
but
the
wine
must
never
be
allowed
to
come
to
a
boil.
Jon
kept
a
careful
eye
on
the
kettle.

As
he
worked,
he
could
hear
the
voices
from
inside
the
tent.
Jarman
Buckwell
said,
вЂњThe
easiest
road
up
into
the
Frostfangs
is
to
follow
the
Milkwater
back
to
its
source.
Yet
if
we
go
that
path,
Rayder
will
know
of
our
approach,
certain
as
sunrise.вЂќ

вЂњThe
GiantвЂ™s
Stair
might
serve,вЂќ
said
Ser
Mallador
Locke,
вЂњor
the
Skirling
Pass,
if
itвЂ™s
clear.вЂќ

The
wine
was
steaming.
Jon
lifted
the
kettle
off
the
fire,
filled
eight
cups,
and
carried
them
into
the
tent.
The
Old
Bear
was
peering
at
the
crude
map
Sam
had
drawn
him
that
night
back
in
CrasterвЂ™s
Keep.
He
took
a
cup
from
JonвЂ™s
tray,
tried
a
swallow
of
wine,
and
gave
a
brusque
nod
of
approval.
His
raven
hopped
down
his
arm.
вЂњCorn,вЂќ
it
said.
вЂњCorn.
Corn.вЂќ

Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
waved
the
wine
away.
вЂњI
would
not
go
into
the
mountains
at
all,вЂќ
he
said
in
a
thin,
tired
voice.
вЂњThe
Frostfangs
have
a
cruel
bite
even
in
summer,
and
nowвЂ¦
if
we
should
be
caught
by
a
stormвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
mean
to
risk
the
Frostfangs
unless
I
must,вЂќ
said
Mormont.
вЂњWildlings
can
no
more
live
on
snow
and
stone
than
we
can.
They
will
emerge
from
the
heights
soon,
and
for
a
host
of
any
size,
the
only
route
is
along
the
Milkwater.
If
so,
we
are
strongly
placed
here.
They
cannot
hope
to
slip
by
us.вЂќ

вЂњThey
may
not
wish
to.
They
are
thousands,
and
we
will
be
three
hundred
when
the
Halfhand
reaches
us.вЂќ
Ser
Mallador
accepted
a
cup
from
Jon.

вЂњIf
it
comes
to
battle,
we
could
not
hope
for
better
ground
than
here,вЂќ
declared
Mormont.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
strengthen
the
defenses.
Pits
and
spikes,
caltrops
scattered
on
the
slopes,
every
breach
mended.
Jarman,
IвЂ™ll
want
your
sharpest
eyes
as
watchers.
A
ring
of
them,
all
around
us
and
along
the
river,
to
warn
of
any
approach.
Hide
them
up
in
trees.
And
we
had
best
start
bringing
up
water
too,
more
than
we
need.
WeвЂ™ll
dig
cisterns.
It
will
keep
the
men
occupied,
and
may
prove
needful
later.вЂќ

вЂњMy
rangersвЂ”вЂќ
started
Thoren
Smallwood.

вЂњYour
rangers
will
limit
their
ranging
to
this
side
of
the
river
until
the
Halfhand
reaches
us.
After
that,
weвЂ™ll
see.
I
will
not
lose
more
of
my
men.вЂќ

вЂњMance
Rayder
might
be
massing
his
host
a
dayвЂ™s
ride
from
here,
and
weвЂ™d
never
know,вЂќ
Smallwood
complained.

вЂњWe
know
where
the
wildlings
are
massing,вЂќ
Mormont
came
back.
вЂњWe
had
it
from
Craster.
I
mislike
the
man,
but
I
do
not
think
he
lied
to
us
in
this.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.вЂќ
Smallwood
took
a
sullen
leave.
The
others
finished
their
wine
and
followed,
more
courteously.

вЂњShall
I
bring
you
supper,
my
lord?вЂќ
Jon
asked.

вЂњCorn,вЂќ
the
raven
cried.
Mormont
did
not
answer
at
once.
When
he
did
he
said
only,
вЂњDid
your
wolf
find
game
today?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
not
back
yet.вЂќ

вЂњWe
could
do
with
fresh
meat.вЂќ
Mormont
dug
into
a
sack
and
offered
his
raven
a
handful
of
corn.
вЂњYou
think
IвЂ™m
wrong
to
keep
the
rangers
close?вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
not
for
me
to
say,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
if
youвЂ™re
asked.вЂќ

вЂњIf
the
rangers
must
stay
in
sight
of
the
Fist,
I
donвЂ™t
see
how
they
can
hope
to
find
my
uncle,вЂќ
Jon
admitted.

вЂњThey
canвЂ™t.вЂќ
The
raven
pecked
at
the
kernels
in
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
palm.
вЂњTwo
hundred
men
or
ten
thousand,
the
country
is
too
vast.вЂќ
The
corn
gone,
Mormont
turned
his
hand
over.

вЂњYou
would
not
give
up
the
search?вЂќ

вЂњMaester
Aemon
thinks
you
clever.вЂќ
Mormont
moved
the
raven
to
his
shoulder.
The
bird
tilted
its
head
to
one
side,
little
eyes
a-glitter.

The
answer
was
there.
вЂњIs
itвЂ¦
it
seems
to
me
that
it
might
be
easier
for
one
man
to
find
two
hundred
than
for
two
hundred
to
find
one.вЂќ

The
raven
gave
a
cackling
scream,
but
the
Old
Bear
smiled
through
the
grey
of
his
beard.
вЂњThis
many
men
and
horses
leave
a
trail
even
Aemon
could
follow.
On
this
hill,
our
fires
ought
to
be
visible
as
far
off
as
the
foothills
of
the
Frostfangs.
If
Ben
Stark
is
alive
and
free,
he
will
come
to
us,
I
have
no
doubt.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
said
Jon,
вЂњbutвЂ¦
what
ifвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦heвЂ™s
dead?вЂќ
Mormont
asked,
not
unkindly.

Jon
nodded,
reluctantly.

вЂњDead,вЂќ
the
raven
said.
вЂњDead.
Dead.вЂќ

вЂњHe
may
come
to
us
anyway,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
said.
вЂњAs
Othor
did,
and
Jafer
Flowers.
I
dread
that
as
much
as
you,
Jon,
but
we
must
admit
the
possibility.вЂќ

вЂњDead,вЂќ
his
raven
cawed,
ruffling
its
wings.
Its
voice
grew
louder
and
more
shrill.
вЂњDead.вЂќ

Mormont
stroked
the
birdвЂ™s
black
feathers,
and
stifled
a
sudden
yawn
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњI
will
forsake
supper,
I
believe.
Rest
will
serve
me
better.
Wake
me
at
first
light.вЂќ

вЂњSleep
well,
my
lord.вЂќ
Jon
gathered
up
the
empty
cups
and
stepped
outside.
He
heard
distant
laughter,
the
plaintive
sound
of
pipes.
A
great
blaze
was
crackling
in
the
center
of
the
camp,
and
he
could
smell
stew
cooking.
The
Old
Bear
might
not
be
hungry,
but
Jon
was.
He
drifted
over
toward
the
fire.

Dywen
was
holding
forth,
spoon
in
hand.
вЂњI
know
this
wood
as
well
as
any
man
alive,
and
I
tell
you,
I
wouldnвЂ™t
care
to
ride
through
it
alone
tonight.
CanвЂ™t
you
smell
it?вЂќ

Grenn
was
staring
at
him
with
wide
eyes,
but
Dolorous
Edd
said,
вЂњAll
I
smell
is
the
shit
of
two
hundred
horses.
And
this
stew.
Which
has
a
similar
aroma,
now
that
I
come
to
sniff
it.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve
got
your
similar
aroma
right
here.вЂќ
Hake
patted
his
dirk.
Grumbling,
he
filled
JonвЂ™s
bowl
from
the
kettle.

The
stew
was
thick
with
barley,
carrot,
and
onion,
with
here
and
there
a
ragged
shred
of
salt
beef,
softened
in
the
cooking.

вЂњWhat
is
it
you
smell,
Dywen?вЂќ
asked
Grenn.

The
forester
sucked
on
his
spoon
a
moment.
He
had
taken
out
his
teeth.
His
face
was
leathery
and
wrinkled,
his
hands
gnarled
as
old
roots.
вЂњSeems
to
me
like
it
smellsвЂ¦
wellвЂ¦
cold.вЂќ

вЂњYour
headвЂ™s
as
wooden
as
your
teeth,вЂќ
Hake
told
him.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
no
smell
to
cold.вЂќ

There
is,
thought
Jon,
remembering
the
night
in
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
chambers.
It
smells
like
death.
Suddenly
he
was
not
hungry
anymore.
He
gave
his
stew
to
Grenn,
who
looked
in
need
of
an
extra
supper
to
warm
him
against
the
night.

The
wind
was
blowing
briskly
when
he
left.
By
morning,
frost
would
cover
the
ground,
and
the
tent
ropes
would
be
stiff
and
frozen.
A
few
fingers
of
spiced
wine
sloshed
in
the
bottom
of
the
kettle.
Jon
fed
fresh
wood
to
the
fire
and
put
the
kettle
over
the
flames
to
reheat.
He
flexed
his
fingers
as
he
waited,
squeezing
and
spreading
until
the
hand
tingled.
The
first
watch
had
taken
up
their
stations
around
the
perimeter
of
the
camp.
Torches
flickered
all
along
the
ringwall.
The
night
was
moonless,
but
a
thousand
stars
shone
overhead.

A
sound
rose
out
of
the
darkness,
faint
and
distant,
but
unmistakable:
the
howling
of
wolves.
Their
voices
rose
and
fell,
a
chilly
song,
and
lonely.
It
made
the
hairs
rise
along
the
back
of
his
neck.
Across
the
fire,
a
pair
of
red
eyes
regarded
him
from
the
shadows.
The
light
of
the
flames
made
them
glow.

вЂњGhost,вЂќ
Jon
breathed,
surprised.
вЂњSo
you
came
inside
after
all,
eh?вЂќ
The
white
wolf
often
hunted
all
night;
he
had
not
expected
to
see
him
again
till
daybreak.
вЂњWas
the
hunting
so
bad?вЂќ
he
asked.
вЂњHere.
To
me,
Ghost.вЂќ

The
direwolf
circled
the
fire,
sniffing
Jon,
sniffing
the
wind,
never
still.
It
did
not
seem
as
if
he
were
after
meat
right
now.
When
the
dead
came
walking,
Ghost
knew.
He
woke
me,
warned
me.
Alarmed,
he
got
to
his
feet.
вЂњis
something
out
there?
Ghost,
do
you
have
a
scent?вЂќ
Dywen
said
he
smelled
cold.

The
direwolf
loped
off,
stopped,
looked
back.
He
wants
me
to
follow.
Pulling
up
the
hood
of
his
cloak,
Jon
walked
away
from
the
tents,
away
from
the
warmth
of
his
fire,
past
the
lines
of
shaggy
little
garrons.
One
of
the
horses
whickered
nervously
when
Ghost
padded
by.
Jon
soothed
him
with
a
word
and
paused
to
stroke
his
muzzle.
He
could
hear
the
wind
whistling
through
cracks
in
the
rocks
as
they
neared
the
ringwall.
A
voice
called
out
a
challenge.
Jon
stepped
into
the
torchlight.
вЂњI
need
to
fetch
water
for
the
Lord
Commander.вЂќ

вЂњGo
on,
then,вЂќ
the
guard
said.
вЂњBe
quick
about
it.вЂќ
Huddled
beneath
his
black
cloak,
with
his
hood
drawn
up
against
the
wind,
the
man
never
even
looked
to
see
if
he
had
a
bucket.

Jon
slipped
sideways
between
two
sharpened
stakes
while
Ghost
slid
beneath
them.
A
torch
had
been
thrust
down
into
a
crevice,
its
flames
flying
pale
orange
banners
when
the
gusts
came.
He
snatched
it
up
as
he
squeezed
through
the
gap
between
the
stones.
Ghost
went
racing
down
the
hill.
Jon
followed
more
slowly,
the
torch
thrust
out
before
him
as
he
made
his
descent.
The
camp
sounds
faded
behind
him.
The
night
was
black,
the
slope
steep,
stony,
and
uneven.
A
momentвЂ™s
inattention
would
be
a
sure
way
to
break
an
ankleвЂ¦
or
his
neck.
What
am
I
doing?
he
asked
himself
as
he
picked
his
way
down.

The
trees
stood
beneath
him,
warriors
armored
in
bark
and
leaf,
deployed
in
their
silent
ranks
awaiting
the
command
to
storm
the
hill.
Black,
they
seemedвЂ¦
it
was
only
when
his
torchlight
brushed
against
them
that
Jon
glimpsed
a
flash
of
green.
Faintly,
he
heard
the
sound
of
water
flowing
over
rocks.
Ghost
vanished
in
the
underbrush.
Jon
struggled
after
him,
listening
to
the
call
of
the
brook,
to
the
leaves
sighing
in
the
wind.
Branches
clutched
at
his
cloak,
while
overhead
thick
limbs
twined
together
and
shut
out
the
stars.

He
found
Ghost
lapping
from
the
stream.
вЂњGhost,вЂќ
he
called,
вЂњto
me.
Now.вЂќ
When
the
direwolf
raised
his
head,
his
eyes
glowed
red
and
baleful,
and
water
streamed
down
from
his
jaws
like
slaver.
There
was
something
fierce
and
terrible
about
him
in
that
instant.
And
then
he
was
off,
bounding
past
Jon,
racing
through
the
trees.
вЂњGhost,
no,
stay,вЂќ
he
shouted,
but
the
wolf
paid
no
heed.
The
lean
white
shape
was
swallowed
by
the
dark,
and
Jon
had
only
two
choicesвЂ”to
climb
the
hill
again,
alone,
or
to
follow.

He
followed,
angry,
holding
the
torch
out
low
so
he
could
see
the
rocks
that
threatened
to
trip
him
with
every
step,
the
thick
roots
that
seemed
to
grab
as
his
feet,
the
holes
where
a
man
could
twist
an
ankle.
Every
few
feet
he
called
again
for
Ghost,
but
the
night
wind
was
swirling
amongst
the
trees
and
it
drank
the
words.
This
is
madness,
he
thought
as
he
plunged
deeper
into
the
trees.
He
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
glimpsed
a
flash
of
white
off
ahead
and
to
the
right,
back
toward
the
hill.
He
jogged
after
it,
cursing
under
his
breath.

A
quarter
way
around
the
Fist
he
chased
the
wolf
before
he
lost
him
again.
Finally
he
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
amidst
the
scrub,
thorns,
and
tumbled
rocks
at
the
base
of
the
hill.
Beyond
the
torchlight,
the
dark
pressed
close.

A
soft
scrabbling
noise
made
him
turn.
Jon
moved
toward
the
sound,
stepping
carefully
among
boulders
and
thornbushes.
Behind
a
fallen
tree,
he
came
on
Ghost
again.
The
direwolf
was
digging
furiously,
kicking
up
dirt.

вЂњWhat
have
you
found?вЂќ
Jon
lowered
the
torch,
revealing
a
rounded
mound
of
soft
earth.
A
grave,
he
thought.
But
whose?

He
knelt,
jammed
the
torch
into
the
ground
beside
him.
The
soil
was
loose,
sandy.
Jon
pulled
it
out
by
the
fistful.
There
were
no
stones,
no
roots.
Whatever
was
here
had
been
put
here
recently.
Two
feet
down,
his
fingers
touched
cloth.
He
had
been
expecting
a
corpse,
fearing
a
corpse,
but
this
was
something
else.
He
pushed
against
the
fabric
and
felt
small,
hard
shapes
beneath,
unyielding.
There
was
no
smell,
no
sign
of
graveworms.
Ghost
backed
off
and
sat
on
his
haunches,
watching.

Jon
brushed
the
loose
soil
away
to
reveal
a
rounded
bundle
perhaps
two
feet
across.
He
jammed
his
fingers
down
around
the
edges
and
worked
it
loose.
When
he
pulled
it
free,
whatever
was
inside
shifted
and
clinked.
Treasure,
he
thought,
but
the
shapes
were
wrong
to
be
coins,
and
the
sound
was
wrong
for
metal.

A
length
of
frayed
rope
bound
the
bundle
together.
Jon
unsheathed
his
dagger
and
cut
it,
groped
for
the
edges
of
the
cloth,
and
pulled.
The
bundle
turned,
and
its
contents
spilled
out
onto
the
ground,
glittering
dark
and
bright.
He
saw
a
dozen
knives,
leaf-shaped
spearheads,
numerous
arrowheads.
Jon
picked
up
a
dagger
blade,
featherlight
and
shiny
black,
hiltless.
Torchlight
ran
along
its
edge,
a
thin
orange
line
that
spoke
of
razor
sharpness.
Dragonglass.
What
the
maesters
call
obsidian.
Had
Ghost
uncovered
some
ancient
cache
of
the
children
of
the
forest,
buried
here
for
thousands
of
years?
The
Fist
of
the
First
Men
was
an
old
place,
onlyвЂ¦

Beneath
the
dragonglass
was
an
old
warhorn,
made
from
an
aurochвЂ™s
horn
and
banded
in
bronze.
Jon
shook
the
dirt
from
inside
it,
and
a
stream
of
arrowheads
fell
out.
He
let
them
fall,
and
pulled
up
a
corner
of
the
cloth
the
weapons
had
been
wrapped
in,
rubbing
it
between
his
fingers.
Good
wool,
thick,
a
double
weave,
damp
but
not
rotted.
It
could
not
have
been
long
in
the
ground.
And
it
was
dark.
He
seized
a
handful
and
pulled
it
close
to
the
torch.
Not
dark.
Black.

Even
before
Jon
stood
and
shook
it
out,
he
knew
what
he
had:
the
black
cloak
of
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.





BRAN

Alebelly
found
him
in
the
forge,
working
the
bellows
for
Mikken.
вЂњMaester
wants
you
in
the
turret,
mвЂ™lord
prince.
ThereвЂ™s
been
a
bird
from
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњFrom
Robb?вЂќ
Excited,
Bran
did
not
wait
for
Hodor,
but
let
Alebelly
carry
him
up
the
steps.
He
was
a
big
man,
though
not
so
big
as
Hodor
and
nowhere
near
as
strong.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
maesterвЂ™s
turret
he
was
red-faced
and
puffing.
Rickon
was
there
before
them,
and
both
Walder
Freys
as
well.

Maester
Luwin
sent
Alebelly
away
and
closed
his
door.
вЂњMy
lords,вЂќ
he
said
gravely,
вЂњwe
have
had
a
message
from
His
Grace,
with
both
good
news
and
ill.
He
has
won
a
great
victory
in
the
west,
shattering
a
Lannister
army
at
a
place
named
Oxcross,
and
has
taken
several
castles
as
well.
He
writes
us
from
Ashemark,
formerly
the
stronghold
of
House
Marbrand.вЂќ

Rickon
tugged
at
the
maesterвЂ™s
robe.
вЂњIs
Robb
coming
home?вЂќ

вЂњNot
just
yet,
I
fear.
There
are
battles
yet
to
fight.вЂќ

вЂњWas
it
Lord
Tywin
he
defeated?вЂќ
asked
Bran.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
said
the
maester.
вЂњSer
Stafford
Lannister
commanded
the
enemy
host.
He
was
slain
in
the
battle.вЂќ

Bran
had
never
even
heard
of
Ser
Stafford
Lannister.
He
found
himself
agreeing
with
Big
Walder
when
he
said,
вЂњLord
Tywin
is
the
only
one
who
matters.вЂќ

вЂњTell
Robb
I
want
him
to
come
home,вЂќ
said
Rickon.
вЂњHe
can
bring
his
wolf
home
too,
and
Mother
and
Father.вЂќ
Though
he
knew
Lord
Eddard
was
dead,
sometimes
Rickon
forgotвЂ¦
willfully,
Bran
suspected.
His
little
brother
was
stubborn
as
only
a
boy
of
four
can
be.

Bran
was
glad
for
RobbвЂ™s
victory,
but
disquieted
as
well.
He
remembered
what
Osha
had
said
the
day
that
his
brother
had
led
his
army
out
Of
Winterfell.
HeвЂ™s
marching
the
wrong
way,
the
wildling
woman
had
insisted.

вЂњSadly,
no
victory
is
without
cost.вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
turned
to
the
Walders.
вЂњMy
lords,
your
uncle
Ser
Stevron
Frey
was
among
those
who
lost
their
lives
at
Oxcross.
He
took
a
wound
in
the
battle,
Robb
writes.
It
was
not
thought
to
be
serious,
but
three
days
later
he
died
in
his
tent,
asleep.вЂќ

Big
Walder
shrugged.
вЂњHe
was
very
old.
Five-and-sixty,
I
think.
Too
old
for
battles.
He
was
always
saying
he
was
tired.вЂќ

Little
Walder
hooted.
вЂњTired
of
waiting
for
our
grandfather
to
die,
you
mean.
Does
this
mean
Ser
EmmonвЂ™s
the
heir
now?вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
be
stupid,вЂќ
his
cousin
said.
вЂњThe
sons
of
the
first
son
come
before
the
second
son.
Ser
Ryman
is
next
in
line,
and
then
Edwyn
and
Black
Walder
and
Petyr
Pimple.
And
then
Aegon
and
all
his
sons.вЂќ

вЂњRyman
is
old
too,вЂќ
said
Little
Walder.
вЂњPast
forty,
I
bet.
And
he
has
a
bad
belly.
Do
you
think
heвЂ™ll
be
lord?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
lord.
I
donвЂ™t
care
if
he
is.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
cut
in
sharply.
вЂњYou
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
such
talk,
my
lords.
Where
is
your
grief?
Your
uncle
is
dead.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
said
Little
Walder.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
very
sad.вЂќ

They
werenвЂ™t,
though.
Bran
got
a
sick
feeling
in
his
belly.
They
like
the
taste
of
this
dish
better
than
I
do.
He
asked
Maester
Luwin
to
be
excused.

вЂњVery
well.вЂќ
The
maester
rang
for
help.
Hodor
must
have
been
busy
in
the
stables.
It
was
Osha
who
came.
She
was
stronger
than
Alebelly,
though,
and
had
no
trouble
lifting
Bran
in
her
arms
and
carrying
him
down
the
steps.

вЂњOsha,вЂќ
Bran
asked
as
they
crossed
the
yard.
вЂњDo
you
know
the
way
north?
To
the
Wall
andвЂ¦
and
even
past?вЂќ

вЂњThe
wayвЂ™s
easy.
Look
for
the
Ice
Dragon,
and
chase
the
blue
star
in
the
riderвЂ™s
eye.вЂќ
She
backed
through
a
door
and
started
up
the
winding
steps.

вЂњAnd
there
are
still
giants
there,
andвЂ¦
the
restвЂ¦
the
Others,
and
the
children
of
the
forest
too?вЂќ

вЂњThe
giants
IвЂ™ve
seen,
the
children
IвЂ™ve
heard
tell
of,
and
the
white
walkersвЂ¦
why
do
you
want
to
know?вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
ever
see
a
three-eyed
crow?вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
She
laughed.
вЂњAnd
I
canвЂ™t
say
IвЂ™d
want
to.вЂќ
Osha
kicked
open
the
door
to
his
bedchamber
and
set
him
in
his
window
seat,
where
he
could
watch
the
yard
below.

It
seemed
only
a
few
heartbeats
after
she
took
her
leave
that
the
door
opened
again,
and
Jojen
Reed
entered
unbidden,
with
his
sister
Meera
behind
him.
вЂњYou
heard
about
the
bird?вЂќ
Bran
asked.
The
other
boy
nodded.
вЂњIt
wasnвЂ™t
a
supper
like
you
said.
It
was
a
letter
from
Robb,
and
we
didnвЂ™t
eat
it,
butвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThe
green
dreams
take
strange
shapes
sometimes,вЂќ
Jojen
admitted.
вЂњThe
truth
of
them
is
not
always
easy
to
understand.вЂќ

вЂњTell
me
the
bad
thing
you
dreamed,вЂќ
Bran
said.
вЂњThe
bad
thing
that
is
coming
to
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњDoes
my
lord
prince
believe
me
now?
Will
he
trust
my
words,
no
matter
how
queer
they
sound
in
his
ears?вЂќ

Bran
nodded.

вЂњIt
is
the
sea
that
comes.вЂќ

вЂњThe
sea?вЂќ

вЂњI
dreamed
that
the
sea
was
lapping
all
around
Winterfell.
I
saw
black
waves
crashing
against
the
gates
and
towers,
and
then
the
salt
water
came
flowing
over
the
walls
and
filled
the
castle.
Drowned
men
were
floating
in
the
yard.
When
I
first
dreamed
the
dream,
back
at
Greywater,
I
didnвЂ™t
know
their
faces,
but
now
I
do.
That
Alebelly
is
one,
the
guard
who
called
our
names
at
the
feast.
Your
septonвЂ™s
another.
Your
smith
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњMikken?вЂќ
Bran
was
as
confused
as
he
was
dismayed.
вЂњBut
the
sea
is
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
leagues
away,
and
WinterfellвЂ™s
walls
are
so
high
the
water
couldnвЂ™t
get
in
even
if
it
did
come.вЂќ

вЂњIn
the
dark
of
night
the
salt
sea
will
flow
over
these
walls,вЂќ
said
Jojen.
вЂњI
saw
the
dead,
bloated
and
drowned.вЂќ

вЂњWe
have
to
tell
them,вЂќ
Bran
said.
вЂњAlebelly
and
Mikken,
and
Septon
Chayle.
Tell
them
not
to
drown.вЂќ

вЂњIt
will
not
save
them,вЂќ
replied
the
boy
in
green.

Meera
came
to
the
window
seat
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder.
вЂњThey
will
not
believe,
Bran.
No
more
than
you
did.вЂќ

Jojen
sat
on
BranвЂ™s
bed.
вЂњTell
me
what
you
dream.вЂќ

He
was
scared,
even
then,
but
he
had
sworn
to
trust
them,
and
a
Stark
of
Winterfell
keeps
his
sworn
word.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
different
kinds,вЂќ
he
said
slowly.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
the
wolf
dreams,
those
arenвЂ™t
so
bad
as
the
others.
I
run
and
hunt
and
kill
squirrels.
And
thereвЂ™s
dreams
where
the
crow
comes
and
tells
me
to
fly.
Sometimes
the
tree
is
in
those
dreams
too,
calling
my
name.
That
frightens
me.
But
the
worst
dreams
are
when
I
fall.вЂќ
He
looked
down
into
the
yard,
feeling
miserable.
вЂњI
never
used
to
fall
before.
When
I
climbed.
I
went
everyplace,
up
on
the
roofs
and
along
the
walls,
I
used
to
feed
the
crows
in
the
Burned
Tower.
Mother
was
afraid
that
I
would
fall
but
I
knew
I
never
would.
Only
I
did,
and
now
when
I
sleep
I
fall
all
the
time.вЂќ

Meera
gave
his
shoulder
a
squeeze.
вЂњIs
that
all?вЂќ

вЂњI
guess.вЂќ

вЂњWarg,вЂќ
said
Jojen
Reed.

Bran
looked
at
him,
his
eyes
wide.
вЂњWhat?вЂќ

вЂњWarg.
Shapechanger.
Beastling.
That
is
what
they
will
call
you,
if
they
should
ever
hear
of
your
wolf
dreams.вЂќ

The
names
made
him
afraid
again.
вЂњWho
will
call
me?вЂќ

вЂњYour
own
folk.
In
fear.
Some
will
hate
you
if
they
know
what
you
are.
Some
will
even
try
to
kill
you.вЂќ

Old
Nan
told
scary
stories
of
beastlings
and
shapechangers
sometimes.
In
the
stories
they
were
always
evil.
вЂњIвЂ™m
not
like
that,вЂќ
Bran
said.
вЂњIвЂ™m
not.
ItвЂ™s
only
dreams.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wolf
dreams
are
no
true
dreams.
You
have
your
eye
closed
tight
whenever
youвЂ™re
awake,
but
as
you
drift
off
it
flutters
open
and
your
soul
seeks
out
its
other
half.
The
power
is
strong
in
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
it.
I
want
to
be
a
knight.вЂќ

вЂњA
knight
is
what
you
want.
A
warg
is
what
you
are.
You
canвЂ™t
change
that,
Bran,
you
canвЂ™t
deny
it
or
push
it
away.
You
are
the
winged
wolf,
but
you
will
never
fly.вЂќ
Jojen
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window.
вЂњUnless
you
open
your
eye.вЂќ
He
put
two
fingers
together
and
poked
Bran
in
the
forehead,
hard.

When
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
spot,
Bran
felt
only
the
smooth
unbroken
skin.
There
was
no
eye,
not
even
a
closed
one.
вЂњHow
can
I
open
it
if
itвЂ™s
not
there?вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
never
find
the
eye
with
your
fingers,
Bran.
You
must
search
with
your
heart.вЂќ
Jojen
studied
BranвЂ™s
face
with
those
strange
green
eyes.
вЂњOr
are
you
afraid?вЂќ

вЂњMaester
Luwin
says
thereвЂ™s
nothing
in
dreams
that
a
man
need
fear.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is,вЂќ
said
Jojen.

вЂњWhat?вЂќ

вЂњThe
past.
The
future.
The
truth.вЂќ

They
left
him
more
muddled
than
ever.
When
he
was
alone,
Bran
tried
to
open
his
third
eye,
but
he
didnвЂ™t
know
how.
No
matter
how
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
and
poked
at
it,
he
couldnвЂ™t
see
any
different
than
heвЂ™d
done
before.
In
the
days
that
followed,
he
tried
to
warn
others
about
what
Jojen
had
seen,
but
it
didnвЂ™t
go
as
he
wanted.
Mikken
thought
it
was
funny.
вЂњThe
sea,
is
it?
Happens
I
always
wanted
to
see
the
sea.
Never
got
where
I
could
go
to
it,
though.
So
now
itвЂ™s
coming
to
me,
is
it?
The
gods
are
good,
to
take
such
trouble
for
a
poor
smith.вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods
will
take
me
when
they
see
fit,вЂќ
Septon
Chayle
said
quietly,
вЂњthough
I
scarcely
think
it
likely
that
IвЂ™ll
drown,
Bran.
I
grew
up
on
the
banks
of
the
White
Knife,
you
know.
IвЂ™m
quite
the
strong
swimmer.вЂќ

Alebelly
was
the
only
one
who
paid
the
warning
any
heed.
He
went
to
talk
to
Jojen
himself,
and
afterward
stopped
bathing
and
refused
to
go
near
the
well.
Finally
he
stank
so
bad
that
six
of
the
other
guards
threw
him
into
a
tub
of
scalding
water
and
scrubbed
him
raw
while
he
screamed
that
they
were
going
to
drown
him
like
the
frogboy
had
said.
Thereafter
he
scowled
whenever
he
saw
Bran
or
Jojen
about
the
castle,
and
muttered
under
his
breath.

It
was
a
few
days
after
AlebellyвЂ™s
bath
that
Ser
Rodrik
returned
to
Winterfell
with
his
prisoner,
a
fleshy
young
man
with
fat
moist
lips
and
long
hair
who
smelled
like
a
privy,
even
worse
than
Alebelly
had.
вЂњReek,
heвЂ™s
called,вЂќ
Hayhead
said
when
Bran
asked
who
it
was.
вЂњI
never
heard
his
true
name.
He
served
the
Bastard
of
Bolton
and
helped
him
murder
Lady
Hornwood,
they
say.вЂќ

The
Bastard
himself
was
dead,
Bran
learned
that
evening
over
supper.
Ser
RodrikвЂ™s
men
had
caught
him
on
Hornwood
land
doing
something
horrible
(Bran
wasnвЂ™t
quite
sure
what,
but
it
seemed
to
be
something
you
did
without
your
clothes)
and
shot
him
down
with
arrows
as
he
tried
to
ride
away.
They
came
too
late
for
poor
Lady
Hornwood,
though.
After
their
wedding,
the
Bastard
had
locked
her
in
a
tower
and
neglected
to
feed
her.
Bran
had
heard
men
saying
that
when
Ser
Rodrik
had
smashed
down
the
door
he
found
her
with
her
mouth
all
bloody
and
her
fingers
chewed
off.

вЂњThe
monster
has
tied
us
a
thorny
knot,вЂќ
the
old
knight
told
Maester
Luwin.
вЂњLike
it
or
no,
Lady
Hornwood
was
his
wife.
He
made
her
say
the
vows
before
both
septon
and
heart
tree,
and
bedded
her
that
very
night
before
witnesses.
She
signed
a
will
naming
him
as
heir
and
fixed
her
seal
to
it.вЂќ

вЂњVows
made
at
sword
point
are
not
valid,вЂќ
the
maester
argued.

вЂњRoose
Bolton
may
not
agree.
Not
with
land
at
issue.вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
looked
unhappy.
вЂњWould
that
I
could
take
this
serving
manвЂ™s
head
off
as
well,
heвЂ™s
as
bad
as
his
master.
But
I
fear
I
must
keep
him
alive
until
Robb
returns
from
his
wars.
He
is
the
only
witness
to
the
worst
of
the
BastardвЂ™s
crimes.
Perhaps
when
Lord
Bolton
hears
his
tale,
he
will
abandon
his
claim,
but
meantime
we
have
Manderly
knights
and
Dreadfort
men
killing
one
another
in
Hornwood
forests,
and
I
lack
the
strength
to
stop
them.вЂќ
The
old
knight
turned
in
his
seat
and
gave
Bran
a
stern
look.
вЂњAnd
what
have
you
been
about
while
IвЂ™ve
been
away,
my
lord
prince?
Commanding
our
guardsmen
not
to
wash?
Do
you
want
them
smelling
like
this
Reek,
is
that
it?вЂќ

вЂњThe
sea
is
coming
here,вЂќ
Bran
said.
вЂњJojen
saw
it
in
a
green
dream.
Alebelly
is
going
to
drown.вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
collar.
вЂњThe
Reed
boy
believes
he
sees
the
future
in
his
dreams,
Ser
Rodrik.
IвЂ™ve
spoken
to
Bran
about
the
uncertainty
of
such
prophecies,
but
if
truth
be
told,
there
is
trouble
along
the
Stony
Shore.
Raiders
in
longships,
plundering
fishing
villages.
Raping
and
burning.
Leobald
Tallhart
has
sent
his
nephew
Benfred
to
deal
with
them,
but
I
expect
theyвЂ™ll
take
to
their
ships
and
flee
at
the
first
sight
of
armed
men.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
and
strike
somewhere
else.
The
Others
take
all
such
cowards.
They
would
never
dare,
no
more
than
the
Bastard
of
Bolton,
if
our
main
strength
were
not
a
thousand
leagues
south.вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
looked
at
Bran.
вЂњWhat
else
did
the
lad
tell
you?вЂќ

вЂњHe
said
the
water
would
flow
over
our
walls.
He
saw
Alebelly
drowned,
and
Mikken
and
Septon
Chayle
too.вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
frowned.
вЂњWell,
should
it
happen
that
I
need
to
ride
against
these
raiders
myself,
I
shanвЂ™t
take
Alebelly,
then.
He
didnвЂ™t
see
me
drowned,
did
he?
No?
Good.вЂќ

It
heartened
Bran
to
hear
that.
Maybe
they
wonвЂ™t
drown,
then,
he
thought.
If
they
stay
away
from
the
sea.

Meera
thought
so
too,
later
that
night
when
she
and
Joien
met
Bran
in
his
room
to
play
a
three-sided
game
of
tiles,
but
her
brother
shook
his
head.
вЂњThe
things
I
see
in
green
dreams
canвЂ™t
be
changed.вЂќ

That
made
his
sister
angry.
вЂњWhy
would
the
gods
send
a
warning
if
we
canвЂ™t
heed
it
and
change
whatвЂ™s
to
come?вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
know,вЂќ
Joien
said
sadly.

вЂњIf
you
were
Alebelly,
youвЂ™d
probably
jump
into
the
well
to
have
done
with
it!
He
should
fight,
and
Bran
should
too.вЂќ

вЂњMe?вЂќ
Bran
felt
suddenly
afraid.
вЂњWhat
should
I
fight?
Am
I
going
to
drown
too?вЂќ

Meera
looked
at
him
guiltily.
вЂњI
shouldnвЂ™t
have
saidвЂ¦вЂќ

He
could
tell
that
she
was
hiding
something.
вЂњDid
you
see
me
in
a
green
dream?вЂќ
he
asked
Jojen
nervously.
вЂњWas
I
drowned?вЂќ

вЂњNot
drowned.вЂќ
Jojen
spoke
as
if
every
word
pained
him.
вЂњI
dreamed
of
the
man
who
came
today,
the
one
they
call
Reek.
You
and
your
brother
lay
dead
at
his
feet,
and
he
was
skinning
off
your
faces
with
a
long
red
blade.вЂќ

Meera
rose
to
her
feet.
вЂњIf
I
went
to
the
dungeon,
I
could
drive
a
spear
right
through
his
heart.
How
could
he
murder
Bran
if
he
was
dead?вЂќ

вЂњThe
gaolers
will
stop
you,вЂќ
Joien
said.
вЂњThe
guards.
And
if
you
tell
them
why
you
want
him
dead,
theyвЂ™ll
never
believe.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
guards
too,вЂќ
Bran
reminded
them.
вЂњAlebelly
and
Poxy
Tym
and
Hayhead
and
the
rest.вЂќ

JojenвЂ™s
mossy
eyes
were
full
of
pity.
вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t
be
able
to
stop
him,
Bran.
I
couldnвЂ™t
see
why,
but
I
saw
the
end
of
it.
I
saw
you
and
Rickon
in
your
crypts,
down
in
the
dark
with
all
the
dead
kings
and
their
stone
wolves.вЂќ

No,
Bran
thought.
No.
вЂњIf
I
went
awayвЂ¦
to
Greywater,
or
to
the
crow,
someplace
far
where
they
couldnвЂ™t
find
meвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњIt
will
not
matter.
The
dream
was
green,
Bran,
and
the
green
dreams
do
not
lie.вЂќ





TYRION

Vrys
stood
over
the
brazier,
warming
his
soft
hands.
вЂњIt
would
appear
Renly
was
murdered
most
fearfully
in
the
very
midst
of
his
army.
His
throat
was
opened
from
ear
to
ear
by
a
blade
that
passed
through
steel
and
bone
as
if
they
were
soft
cheese.вЂќ

вЂњMurdered
by
whose
hand?вЂќ
Cersei
demanded.

вЂњHave
you
ever
considered
that
too
many
answers
are
the
same
as
no
answer
at
all?
My
informers
are
not
always
as
highly
placed
as
we
might
like.
When
a
king
dies,
fancies
sprout
like
mushrooms
in
the
dark.
A
groom
says
that
Renly
was
slain
by
a
knight
of
his
own
Rainbow
Guard.
A
washerwoman
claims
Stannis
stole
through
the
heart
of
his
brotherвЂ™s
army
with
his
magic
sword.
Several
men-at-arms
believe
a
woman
did
the
fell
deed,
but
cannot
agree
on
which
woman.
A
maid
that
Renly
had
spurned,
claims
one.
A
camp
follower
brought
in
to
serve
his
pleasure
on
the
eve
of
battle,
says
a
second.
The
third
ventures
that
it
might
have
been
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.вЂќ

The
queen
was
not
pleased.
вЂњMust
you
waste
our
time
with
every
rumor
the
fools
care
to
tell?вЂќ

вЂњYou
pay
me
well
for
these
rumors,
my
gracious
queen.вЂќ

вЂњWe
pay
you
for
the
truth,
Lord
Varys.
Remember
that,
or
this
small
council
may
grow
smaller
still.вЂќ

Varys
tittered
nervously.
вЂњYou
and
your
noble
brother
will
leave
His
Grace
with
no
council
at
all
if
you
continue.вЂќ

вЂњI
daresay,
the
realm
could
survive
a
few
less
councillors,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger
with
a
smile.

вЂњDear
dear
Petyr,вЂќ
said
Varys,
вЂњare
you
not
concerned
that
yours
might
be
the
next
name
on
the
HandвЂ™s
little
list?вЂќ

вЂњBefore
you,
Varys?
I
should
never
dream
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњMayhaps
we
will
be
brothers
on
the
Wall
together,
you
and
I.вЂќ
Varys
giggled
again.

вЂњSooner
than
youвЂ™d
like,
if
the
next
words
out
of
your
mouth
are
not
something
useful,
eunuch.вЂќ
From
the
look
of
her
eyes,
Cersei
was
prepared
to
castrate
Varys
all
over
again.

вЂњMight
this
be
some
ruse?вЂќ
asked
Littlefinger.

вЂњIf
so,
it
is
a
ruse
of
surpassing
cleverness,вЂќ
said
Varys.
вЂњIt
has
certainly
hoodwinked
me.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
heard
enough.
вЂњJoff
will
be
so
disappointed,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњHe
was
saving
such
a
nice
spike
for
RenlyвЂ™s
head.
But
whoever
did
the
deed,
we
must
assume
Stannis
was
behind
it.
The
gain
is
clearly
his.вЂќ
He
did
not
like
this
news;
he
had
counted
on
the
brothers
Baratheon
decimating
each
other
in
bloody
battle.
He
could
feel
his
elbow
throbbing
where
the
morningstar
had
laid
it
open.
It
did
that
sometimes
in
the
damp.
He
squeezed
it
uselessly
in
his
hand
and
asked,
вЂњWhat
of
RenlyвЂ™s
host?вЂќ

вЂњThe
greater
part
of
his
foot
remains
at
Bitterbridge.вЂќ
Varys
abandoned
the
brazier
to
take
his
seat
at
the
table.
вЂњMost
of
the
lords
who
rode
with
Lord
Renly
to
StormвЂ™s
End
have
gone
over
banner-and-blade
to
Stannis,
with
all
their
chivalry.вЂќ

вЂњLed
by
the
Florents,
IвЂ™d
wager,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger.

Varys
gave
him
a
simpering
smile.
вЂњYou
would
win,
my
lord.
Lord
Alester
was
indeed
the
first
to
bend
the
knee.
Many
others
followed.вЂќ

вЂњMany,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
pointedly,
вЂњbut
not
all?вЂќ

вЂњNot
all,вЂќ
agreed
the
eunuch.
вЂњNot
Loras
Tyrell,
nor
Randyll
Tarly,
nor
Mathis
Rowan.
And
StormвЂ™s
End
itself
has
not
yielded.
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
holds
the
castle
in
RenlyвЂ™s
name,
and
will
not
believe
his
liege
is
dead.
He
demands
to
see
the
mortal
remains
before
he
opens
his
gates,
but
it
seems
that
RenlyвЂ™s
corpse
has
unaccountably
vanished.
Carried
away,
most
likely.
A
fifth
of
RenlyвЂ™s
knights
departed
with
Ser
Loras
rather
than
bend
the
knee
to
Stannis.
ItвЂ™s
said
the
Knight
of
Flowers
went
mad
when
he
saw
his
kingвЂ™s
body,
and
slew
three
of
RenlyвЂ™s
guards
in
his
wrath,
among
them
Emmon
Cuy
and
Robar
Royce.вЂќ

A
pity
he
stopped
at
three,
thought
Tyrion.

вЂњSer
Loras
is
likely
making
for
Bitterbridge,вЂќ
Varys
went
on.
вЂњHis
sister
is
there,
RenlyвЂ™s
queen,
as
well
as
a
great
many
soldiers
who
suddenly
find
themselves
kingless.
Which
side
will
they
take
now?
A
ticklish
question.
Many
serve
the
lords
who
remained
at
StormвЂ™s
End,
and
those
lords
now
belong
to
Stannis.вЂќ

Tyrion
leaned
forward.
вЂњThere
is
a
chance
here,
it
seems
to
me.
Win
Loras
Tyrell
to
our
cause
and
Lord
Mace
Tyrell
and
his
bannermen
might
join
us
as
well.
They
may
have
sworn
their
swords
to
Stannis
for
the
moment,
yet
they
cannot
love
the
man,
or
they
would
have
been
his
from
the
start.вЂќ

вЂњIs
their
love
for
us
any
greater?вЂќ
asked
Cersei.

вЂњScarcely,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњThey
loved
Renly,
clearly,
but
Renly
is
slain.
Perhaps
we
can
give
them
good
and
sufficient
reasons
to
prefer
Joffrey
to
StannisвЂ¦
if
we
move
quickly.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
sort
of
reasons
do
you
mean
to
give
them?вЂќ

вЂњGold
reasons,вЂќ
Littlefinger
suggested
at
once.

Varys
made
a
tsking
sound.
вЂњSweet
Petyr,
surely
you
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
these
puissant
lords
and
noble
knights
could
be
bought
like
so
many
chickens
in
the
market.вЂќ

вЂњHave
you
been
to
our
markets
of
late,
Lord
Varys?вЂќ
asked
Littlefinger.
вЂњYouвЂ™d
find
it
easier
to
buy
a
lord
than
a
chicken,
I
daresay.
Of
course,
lords
cluck
prouder
than
chickens,
and
take
it
ill
if
you
offer
them
coin
like
a
tradesman,
but
they
are
seldom
adverse
to
taking
giftsвЂ¦
honors,
lands,
castlesвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњBribes
might
sway
some
of
the
lesser
lords,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
вЂњbut
never
Highgarden.вЂќ

вЂњTrue,вЂќ
Littlefinger
admitted.
вЂњThe
Knight
of
Flowers
is
the
key
there.
Mace
Tyrell
has
two
older
sons,
but
Loras
has
always
been
his
favorite.
Win
him,
and
Highgarden
will
be
yours.вЂќ

Yes,
Tyrion
thought.
вЂњIt
seems
to
me
we
should
take
a
lesson
from
the
late
Lord
Renly.
We
can
win
the
Tyrell
alliance
as
he
did.
With
a
marriage.вЂќ

Varys
understood
the
quickest.
вЂњYou
think
to
wed
King
Joffrey
to
Margaery
Tyrell.вЂќ

вЂњI
do.вЂќ
RenlyвЂ™s
young
queen
was
no
more
than
fifteen,
sixteen,
he
seemed
to
recallвЂ¦
older
than
Joffrey,
but
a
few
years
were
nothing,
it
was
so
neat
and
sweet
he
could
taste
it.

вЂњJoffrey
is
betrothed
to
Sansa
Stark,вЂќ
Cersei
objected.

вЂњMarriage
contracts
can
be
broken.
What
advantage
is
there
in
wedding
the
king
to
the
daughter
of
a
dead
traitor?вЂќ

Littlefinger
spoke
up.
вЂњYou
might
point
out
to
His
Grace
that
the
Tyrells
are
much
wealthier
than
the
Starks,
and
that
Margaery
is
said
to
be
lovelyвЂ¦
and
beddable
besides.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
said
Tyrion,
вЂњJoff
ought
to
like
that
well
enough.вЂќ

вЂњMy
son
is
too
young
to
care
about
such
things.вЂќ

вЂњYou
think
so?вЂќ
asked
Tyrion.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
thirteen,
Cersei.
The
same
age
at
which
I
married.вЂќ

вЂњYou
shamed
us
all
with
that
sorry
episode.
Joffrey
is
made
of
finer
stuff.вЂќ

вЂњSo
fine
that
he
had
Ser
Boros
rip
off
SansaвЂ™s
gown.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
angry
with
the
girl.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
angry
with
that
cookвЂ™s
boy
who
spilled
the
soup
last
night
as
well,
but
he
didnвЂ™t
strip
him
naked.вЂќ

вЂњThis
was
not
a
matter
of
some
spilled
soupвЂ”вЂќ

No,
it
was
a
matter
of
some
pretty
teats.
After
that
business
in
the
yard,
Tyrion
had
spoken
with
Varys
about
how
they
might
arrange
for
Joffrey
to
visit
ChatayaвЂ™s.
A
taste
of
honey
might
sweeten
the
boy,
he
hoped.
He
might
even
be
grateful,
gods
forbid,
and
Tyrion
could
do
with
a
shade
more
gratitude
from
his
sovereign.
It
would
need
to
be
done
secretly,
of
course.
The
tricky
bit
would
be
parting
him
from
the
Hound.
вЂњThe
dog
is
never
far
from
his
masterвЂ™s
heels,вЂќ
heвЂ™d
observed
to
Varys,
вЂњbut
all
men
sleep.
And
some
gamble
and
whore
and
visit
winesinks
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Hound
does
all
these
things,
if
that
is
your
question.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњMy
question
is
when.вЂќ

Varys
had
laid
a
finger
on
his
cheek,
smiling
enigmatically.
вЂњMy
lord,
a
suspicious
man
might
think
you
wished
to
find
a
time
when
Sandor
Clegane
was
not
protecting
King
Joffrey,
the
better
to
do
the
boy
some
harm.вЂќ

вЂњSurely
you
know
me
better
than
that,
Lord
Varys,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњWhy,
all
I
want
is
for
Joffrey
to
love
me.вЂќ

The
eunuch
had
promised
to
look
into
the
matter.
The
war
made
its
own
demands,
though;
JoffreyвЂ™s
initiation
into
manhood
would
need
to
wait.
вЂњDoubtless
you
know
your
son
better
than
I
do,вЂќ
he
made
himself
tell
Cersei,
вЂњbut
regardless,
thereвЂ™s
still
much
to
be
said
for
a
Tyrell
marriage.
It
may
be
the
only
way
that
Joffrey
lives
long
enough
to
reach
his
wedding
night.вЂќ

Littlefinger
agreed.
вЂњThe
Stark
girl
brings
Joffrey
nothing
but
her
body,
sweet
as
that
may
be.
Margaery
Tyrell
brings
fifty
thousand
swords
and
all
the
strength
of
Highgarden.вЂќ

вЂњIndeed.вЂќ
Varys
laid
a
soft
hand
on
the
queenвЂ™s
sleeve.
вЂњYou
have
a
motherвЂ™s
heart,
and
I
know
His
Grace
loves
his
little
sweetling.
Yet
kings
must
learn
to
put
the
needs
of
the
realm
before
their
own
desires.
I
say
this
offer
must
be
made.вЂќ

The
queen
pulled
free
of
the
eunuchвЂ™s
touch.
вЂњYou
would
not
speak
so
if
you
were
women.
Say
what
you
will,
my
lords,
but
Joffrey
is
too
proud
to
settle
for
RenlyвЂ™s
leavings.
He
will
never
consent.вЂќ

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњWhen
the
king
comes
of
age
in
three
years,
he
may
give
or
withhold
his
consent
as
he
pleases.
Until
then,
you
are
his
regent
and
I
am
his
Hand,
and
he
will
marry
whomever
we
tell
him
to
marry.
Leavings
or
no.вЂќ

CerseiвЂ™s
quiver
was
empty.
вЂњMake
your
offer
then,
but
gods
save
you
all
if
Joff
does
not
like
this
girl.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
so
pleased
we
can
agree,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњNow,
which
of
us
shall
go
to
Bitterbridge?
We
must
reach
Ser
Loras
with
our
offer
before
his
blood
can
cool.вЂќ

вЂњYou
mean
to
send
one
of
the
council?вЂќ

вЂњI
can
scarcely
expect
the
Knight
of
Flowers
to
treat
with
Bronn
or
Shagga,
can
I?
The
Tyrells
are
proud.вЂќ

His
sister
wasted
no
time
trying
to
twist
the
situation
to
her
advantage.
вЂњSer
Jacelyn
Bywater
is
nobly
born.
Send
him.вЂќ

Tyrion
shook
his
head.
вЂњWe
need
someone
who
can
do
more
than
repeat
our
words
and
fetch
back
a
reply.
Our
envoy
must
speak
for
king
and
council
and
settle
the
matter
quickly.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Hand
speaks
with
the
kingвЂ™s
voice.вЂќ
Candlelight
gleamed
green
as
wildfire
in
CerseiвЂ™s
eyes.
вЂњIf
we
send
you,
Tyrion,
it
will
be
as
if
Joffrey
went
himself.
And
who
better,
You
wield
words
as
skillfully
as
Jaime
wields
a
sword.вЂќ

Are
you
that
eager
to
get
me
out
of
the
city,
Cersei?
вЂњYou
are
too
kind,
sister,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
boyвЂ™s
mother
is
better
fitted
to
arrange
his
marriage
than
any
uncle.
And
you
have
a
gift
for
winning
friends
that
I
could
never
hope
to
match.вЂќ

Her
eyes
narrowed.
вЂњJoff
needs
me
at
his
side.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace,
my
lord
Hand,вЂќ
said
Littlefinger,
вЂњthe
king
needs
both
of
you
here.
Let
me
go
in
your
stead.вЂќ

вЂњYou?вЂќ
What
gain
does
he
see
in
this?
Tyrion
wondered.

вЂњI
am
of
the
kingвЂ™s
council,
yet
not
the
kingвЂ™s
blood,
so
I
would
make
a
poor
hostage.
I
knew
Ser
Loras
passing
well
when
he
was
here
at
court,
and
gave
him
no
cause
to
mislike
me.
Mace
Tyrell
bears
me
no
enmity
that
I
know
of,
and
I
flatter
myself
that
I
am
not
unskilled
in
negotiation.вЂќ

He
has
us.
Tyrion
did
not
trust
Petyr
Baelish,
nor
did
he
want
the
man
out
of
his
sight,
yet
what
other
choice
was
left
him?
It
must
be
Littlefinger
or
Tyrion
himself,
and
he
knew
full
well
that
if
he
left
KingвЂ™s
Landing
for
any
length
of
time,
all
that
he
had
managed
to
accomplish
would
be
undone.
вЂњThere
is
fighting
between
here
and
Bitterbridge,вЂќ
he
said
cautiously.
вЂњAnd
you
can
be
past
certain
that
Lord
Stannis
will
be
dispatching
his
own
shepherds
to
gather
in
his
brotherвЂ™s
wayward
lambs.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve
never
been
frightened
of
shepherds.
ItвЂ™s
the
sheep
who
trouble
me.
Still,
I
suppose
an
escort
might
be
in
order.вЂќ

вЂњI
can
spare
a
hundred
gold
cloaks,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.

вЂњFive
hundred.вЂќ

вЂњThree
hundred.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
forty
moreвЂ”twenty
knights
with
as
many
squires.
If
I
arrive
without
a
knightly
tail,
the
Tyrells
will
think
me
of
small
account.вЂќ

That
was
true
enough.
вЂњAgreed.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
include
Horror
and
Slobber
in
my
party,
and
send
them
on
to
their
lord
father
afterward.
A
gesture
of
goodwill.
We
need
Paxter
Redwyne,
heвЂ™s
Mace
TyrellвЂ™s
oldest
friend,
and
a
great
power
in
his
own
right.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
traitor,вЂќ
the
queen
said,
balking.
вЂњThe
Arbor
would
have
declared
for
Renly
with
all
the
rest,
except
that
Redwyne
knew
full
well
his
whelps
would
suffer
for
it.вЂќ

вЂњRenly
is
dead,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Littlefinger
pointed
out,
вЂњand
neither
Stannis
nor
Lord
Paxter
will
have
forgotten
how
Redwyne
galleys
closed
the
sea
during
the
siege
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
Restore
the
twins
and
perchance
we
may
win
RedwyneвЂ™s
love.вЂќ

Cersei
remained
unconvinced.
вЂњThe
Others
can
keep
his
love,
I
want
his
swords
and
sails.
Holding
tight
to
those
twins
is
the
best
way
to
make
certain
that
weвЂ™ll
have
them.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
the
answer.
вЂњThen
let
us
send
Ser
Hobber
back
to
the
Arbor
and
keep
Ser
Horas
here.
Lord
Paxter
ought
to
be
clever
enough
to
riddle
out
the
meaning
of
that,
I
should
think.вЂќ

The
suggestion
was
carried
without
protest,
but
Littlefinger
was
not
done.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
want
horses.
Swift
and
strong.
The
fighting
will
make
remounts
hard
to
come
by.
A
goodly
supply
of
gold
will
also
be
needed,
for
those
gifts
we
spoke
of
earlier.вЂќ

вЂњTake
as
much
as
you
require.
If
the
city
falls,
Stannis
will
steal
it
all
anyway.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
want
my
commission
in
writing.
A
document
that
will
leave
Mace
Tyrell
in
no
doubt
as
to
my
authority,
granting
me
full
power
to
treat
with
him
concerning
this
match
and
any
other
arrangements
that
might
be
required,
and
to
make
binding
pledges
in
the
kingвЂ™s
name.
It
should
be
signed
by
Joffrey
and
every
member
of
this
council,
and
bear
all
our
seals.вЂќ

Tyrion
shifted
uncomfortably.
вЂњDone.
Will
that
be
all?
I
remind
you,
thereвЂ™s
a
long
road
between
here
and
Bitterbridge.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
riding
it
before
dawn
breaks.вЂќ
Littlefinger
rose.
вЂњI
trust
that
on
my
return,
the
king
will
see
that
I
am
suitably
rewarded
for
my
valiant
efforts
in
his
cause?вЂќ

Varys
giggled.
вЂњJoffrey
is
such
a
grateful
sovereign,
IвЂ™m
certain
you
will
have
no
cause
to
complain,
my
good
brave
lord.вЂќ

The
queen
was
more
direct.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want,
Petyr?вЂќ

Littlefinger
glanced
at
Tyrion
with
a
sly
smile.
вЂњI
shall
need
to
give
that
some
consideration.
No
doubt
IвЂ™ll
think
of
something.вЂќ
He
sketched
an
airy
bow
and
took
his
leave,
as
casual
as
if
he
were
off
to
one
of
his
brothels.

Tyrion
glanced
out
the
window.
The
fog
was
so
thick
that
he
could
not
even
see
the
curtain
wall
across
the
yard.
A
few
dim
lights
shone
indistinct
through
that
greyness.
A
foul
day
for
travel,
he
thought.
He
did
not
envy
Petyr
Baelish.
вЂњWe
had
best
see
to
drawing
up
those
documents.
Lord
Varys,
send
for
parchment
and
quill.
And
someone
will
need
to
wake
Joffrey.вЂќ

It
was
still
grey
and
dark
when
the
meeting
finally
ended.
Varys
scurried
off
alone,
his
soft
slippers
whisking
along
the
floor.
The
Lannisters
lingered
a
moment
by
the
door.
вЂњHow
comes
your
chain,
brother?вЂќ
the
queen
asked
as
Ser
Preston
fastened
a
vair-lined
cloth-of-silver
cloak
about
her
shoulders.

вЂњLink
by
link,
it
grows
longer.
We
should
thank
the
gods
that
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
as
stubborn
as
he
is.
Stannis
will
never
march
north
with
StormвЂ™s
End
untaken
in
his
rear.вЂќ

вЂњTyrion,
I
know
we
do
not
always
agree
on
policy,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
I
was
wrong
about
you.
You
are
not
so
big
a
fool
as
I
imagined.
In
truth,
I
realize
now
that
you
have
been
a
great
help.
For
that
I
thank
you.
You
must
forgive
me
if
I
have
spoken
to
you
harshly
in
the
past.вЂќ

вЂњMust
I?вЂќ
He
gave
her
a
shrug,
a
smile.
вЂњSweet
sister,
you
have
said
nothing
that
requires
forgiveness.вЂќ

вЂњToday,
you
mean?вЂќ
They
both
laughedвЂ¦
and
Cersei
leaned
over
and
planted
a
quick,
soft
kiss
on
his
brow.

Too
astonished
for
words,
Tyrion
could
only
watch
her
stride
off
down
the
hall,
Ser
Preston
at
her
side.
вЂњHave
I
lost
my
wits,
or
did
my
sister
just
kiss
me?вЂќ
he
asked
Bronn
when
she
was
gone.

вЂњWas
it
so
sweet?вЂќ

вЂњIt
wasвЂ¦
unanticipated.вЂќ
Cersei
had
been
behaving
queerly
of
late.
Tyrion
found
it
very
unsettling.
вЂњI
am
trying
to
recall
the
last
time
she
kissed
me.
I
could
not
have
been
more
than
six
or
seven.
Jaime
had
dared
her
to
do
it.вЂќ

вЂњThe
womanвЂ™s
finally
taken
note
of
your
charms.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњNo,
the
woman
is
hatching
something.
Best
find
out
what,
Bronn.
You
know
I
hate
surprises.вЂќ





THEON

Theon
wiped
the
spittle
off
his
cheek
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњRobb
will
gut
you,
Greyjoy,вЂќ
Benfred
Tallheart
screamed.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
feed
your
turncloakвЂ™s
heart
to
his
wolf,
you
piece
of
sheep
dung.вЂќ

Aeron
DamphairвЂ™s
voice
cut
through
the
insults
like
a
sword
through
cheese.
вЂњNow
you
must
kill
him.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
questions
for
him
first,вЂќ
said
Theon.

вЂњFuck
your
questions.вЂќ
Benfred
hung
bleeding
and
helpless
between
Stygg
and
Werlag.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
choke
on
them
before
you
get
any
answers
from
me,
craven.
Turncloak.вЂќ

Uncle
Aeron
was
relentless.
вЂњWhen
he
spits
on
you,
he
spits
on
all
of
us.
He
spits
on
the
Drowned
God.
He
must
die.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
gave
me
the
command
here,
Uncle.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
sent
me
to
counsel
you.вЂќ

And
to
watch
me.
Theon
dare
not
push
matters
too
far
with
his
uncle.
The
command
was
his,
yes,
but
his
men
had
a
faith
in
the
Drowned
God
that
they
did
not
have
in
him,
and
they
were
terrified
of
Aeron
Damphair.
I
cannot
fault
them
for
that.

вЂњYouвЂ™ll
lose
your
head
for
this,
Greyjoy.
The
crows
will
eat
the
jelly
of
your
eyes.вЂќ
Benfred
tried
to
spit
again,
but
only
managed
a
little
blood.
вЂњThe
Others
bugger
your
wet
god.вЂќ

Tallhart,
youвЂ™ve
spit
away
your
life,
Theon
thought.
вЂњStygg,
silence
him,вЂќ
he
said.

They
forced
Benfred
to
his
knees.
Werlag
tore
the
rabbitskin
off
his
belt
and
jammed
it
between
his
teeth
to
stop
his
shouting.
Stygg
unlimbered
his
axe.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Aeron
Damphair
declared.
вЂњHe
must
be
given
to
the
god.
The
old
way.вЂќ

What
does
it
matter?
Dead
is
dead.
вЂњTake
him,
then.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
come
as
well.
You
command
here.
The
offering
should
come
from
you.вЂќ

That
was
more
than
Theon
could
stomach.
вЂњYou
are
the
priest,
Uncle,
I
leave
the
god
to
you.
Do
me
the
same
kindness
and
leave
the
battles
to
me.вЂќ
He
waved
his
hand,
and
Werlag
and
Stygg
began
to
drag
their
captive
off
toward
the
shore.
Aeron
Damphair
gave
his
nephew
a
reproachful
look,
then
followed.
Down
to
the
pebbled
beach
they
would
go,
to
drown
Benfred
Tallhart
in
salt
water.
The
old
way.

Perhaps
itвЂ™s
a
kindness,
Theon
told
himself
as
he
stalked
off
in
the
other
direction.
Stygg
was
hardly
the
most
expert
of
headsmen,
and
Benfred
had
a
neck
thick
as
a
boarвЂ™s,
heavy
with
muscle
and
fat.
I
used
to
mock
him
for
it,
just
to
see
how
angry
I
could
make
him,
he
remembered.
That
had
been,
what,
three
years
past?
When
Ned
Stark
had
ridden
to
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
to
see
Ser
Helman,
Theon
had
accompanied
him
and
spent
a
fortnight
in
BenfredвЂ™s
company.

He
could
hear
the
rough
noises
of
victory
from
the
crook
in
the
road
where
the
battle
had
been
foughtвЂ¦
if
youвЂ™d
go
so
far
as
to
call
it
a
battle.
More
like
slaughtering
sheep,
if
truth
be
told.
Sheep
fleeced
in
steel,
but
sheep
nonetheless.

Climbing
a
jumble
of
stone,
Theon
looked
down
on
the
dead
men
and
dying
horses.
The
horses
had
deserved
better.
Tymor
and
his
brothers
had
gathered
up
what
mounts
had
come
through
the
fight
unhurt,
while
Urzen
and
Black
Lorren
silenced
the
animals
too
badly
wounded
to
be
saved.
The
rest
of
his
men
were
looting
the
corpses.
Gevin
Harlaw
knelt
on
a
dead
manвЂ™s
chest,
sawing
off
his
finger
to
get
at
a
ring.
Paying
the
iron
price.
My
lord
father
would
approve.
Theon
thought
of
seeking
out
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
heвЂ™d
slain
himself
to
see
if
they
had
any
jewelry
worth
the
taking,
but
the
notion
left
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth.
He
could
imagine
what
Eddard
Stark
would
have
said.
Yet
that
thought
made
him
angry
too.
Stark
is
dead
and
rotting,
and
naught
to
me,
he
reminded
himself.

Old
Botley,
who
was
called
Fishwhiskers,
sat
scowling
by
his
pile
of
plunder
while
his
three
sons
added
to
it.
One
of
them
was
in
a
shoving
match
with
a
fat
man
named
Todric,
who
was
reeling
among
the
slain
with
a
horn
of
ale
in
one
hand
and
an
axe
in
the
other,
clad
in
a
cloak
of
white
foxfur
only
slightly
stained
by
the
blood
of
its
previous
owner.
Drunk,
Theon
decided,
watching
him
bellow.
It
was
said
that
the
ironmen
of
old
had
oft
been
blood-drunk
in
battle,
so
berserk
that
they
felt
no
pain
and
feared
no
foe,
but
this
was
a
common
ale-drunk.

вЂњWex,
my
bow
and
quiver.вЂќ
The
boy
ran
and
fetched
them.
Theon
bent
the
bow
and
slipped
the
string
into
its
notches
as
Todric
knocked
down
the
Botley
boy
and
flung
ale
into
his
eyes.
Fishwhiskers
leapt
up
cursing,
but
Theon
was
quicker.
He
drew
on
the
hand
that
clutched
the
drinking
horn,
figuring
to
give
them
a
shot
to
talk
about,
but
Todric
spoiled
it
by
lurching
to
one
side
just
as
he
loosed.
The
arrow
took
him
through
the
belly.

The
looters
stopped
to
gape.
Theon
lowered
his
bow.
вЂњNo
drunkards,
I
said,
and
no
squabbles
over
plunder.вЂќ
On
his
knees,
Todric
was
dying
noisily.
вЂњBotley,
silence
him.вЂќ
Fishwhiskers
and
his
sons
were
quick
to
obey.
They
slit
TodricвЂ™s
throat
as
he
kicked
feebly,
and
were
stripping
him
of
cloak
and
rings
and
weapons
before
he
was
even
dead.

Now
they
know
I
mean
what
I
say.
Lord
Balon
might
have
given
him
the
command,
but
Theon
knew
that
some
of
his
men
saw
only
a
soft
boy
from
the
green
lands
when
they
looked
at
him.
вЂњAnyone
else
have
a
thirst?вЂќ
No
one
replied.
вЂњGood.вЂќ
He
kicked
at
BenfredвЂ™s
fallen
banner,
clutched
in
the
dead
hand
of
the
squire
whoвЂ™d
borne
it.
A
rabbitskin
had
been
tied
below
the
flag.
Why
rabbitskins?
he
had
meant
to
ask,
but
being
spat
on
had
made
him
forget
his
questions.
He
tossed
his
bow
back
to
Wex
and
strode
off,
remembering
how
elated
heвЂ™d
felt
after
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
wondering
why
this
did
not
taste
as
sweet.
Tallhart,
you
bloody
overproud
fool,
you
never
even
sent
out
a
scout.

TheyвЂ™d
been
joking
and
even
singing
as
theyвЂ™d
come
on,
the
three
trees
of
Tallhart
streaming
above
them
while
rabbitskins
flapped
stupidly
from
the
points
of
their
lances.
The
archers
concealed
behind
the
gorse
had
spoiled
the
song
with
a
rain
of
arrows,
and
Theon
himself
had
led
his
men-at-arms
out
to
finish
the
butcherвЂ™s
work
with
dagger,
axe,
and
warhammer.
He
had
ordered
their
leader
spared
for
questioning.

Only
he
had
not
expected
it
to
be
Benfred
Tallhart.

His
limp
body
was
being
dragged
from
the
surf
when
Theon
returned
to
his
Sea
Bitch.
The
masts
of
his
longships
stood
outlined
against
the
sky
along
the
pebbled
beach.
Of
the
fishing
village,
nothing
remained
but
cold
ashes
that
stank
when
it
rained.
The
men
had
been
put
to
the
sword,
all
but
a
handful
that
Theon
had
allowed
to
flee
to
bring
the
word
to
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square.
Their
wives
and
daughters
had
been
claimed
for
salt
wives,
those
who
were
young
enough
and
fair.
The
crones
and
the
ugly
ones
had
simply
been
raped
and
killed,
or
taken
for
thralls
if
they
had
useful
skills
and
did
not
seem
likely
to
cause
trouble.

Theon
had
planned
that
attack
as
well,
bringing
his
ships
up
to
the
shore
in
the
chill
darkness
before
the
dawn
and
leaping
from
the
prow
with
a
longaxe
in
his
hand
to
lead
his
men
into
the
sleeping
village.
He
did
not
like
the
taste
of
any
of
this,
but
what
choice
did
he
have?

His
thrice-damned
sister
was
sailing
her
Black
Wind
north
even
now,
sure
to
win
a
castle
of
her
own.
Lord
Balon
had
let
no
word
of
the
hosting
escape
the
Iron
Islands,
and
TheonвЂ™s
bloody
work
along
the
Stony
Shore
would
be
put
down
to
sea
raiders
out
for
plunder.
The
northmen
would
not
realize
their
true
peril,
not
until
the
hammers
fell
on
Deepwood
Motte
and
Moat
Cailin.
And
after
all
is
done
and
won,
they
will
make
songs
for
that
bitch
Asha,
and
forget
that
I
was
even
here.
That
is,
if
he
allowed
it.

Dagmer
Cleftjaw
stood
by
the
high
carved
prow
of
his
longship,
Foamdrinker.
Theon
had
assigned
him
the
task
of
guarding
the
ships;
otherwise
men
would
have
called
it
DagmerвЂ™s
victory,
not
his.
A
more
prickly
man
might
have
taken
that
for
a
slight,
but
the
Cleftjaw
had
only
laughed.

вЂњThe
day
is
won,вЂќ
Dagmer
called
down.
вЂњAnd
yet
you
do
not
smile,
boy.
The
living
should
smile,
for
the
dead
cannot.вЂќ
He
smiled
himself
to
show
how
it
was
done.
It
made
for
a
hideous
sight.
Under
a
snowy
white
mane
of
hair,
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
had
the
most
gut-churning
scar
Theon
had
ever
seen,
the
legacy
of
the
longaxe
that
had
near
killed
him
as
a
boy.
The
blow
had
splintered
his
jaw,
shattered
his
front
teeth,
and
left
him
four
lips
where
other
men
had
but
two.
A
shaggy
beard
covered
his
cheeks
and
neck,
but
the
hair
would
not
grow
over
the
scar,
so
a
shiny
seam
of
puckered,
twisted
flesh
divided
his
face
like
a
crevasse
through
a
snowfield.
вЂњWe
could
hear
them
singing,вЂќ
the
old
warrior
said.
вЂњIt
was
a
good
song,
and
they
sang
it
bravely.вЂќ

вЂњThey
sang
better
than
they
fought.
Harps
would
have
done
them
as
much
good
as
their
lances
did.вЂќ

вЂњHow
many
men
are
lost?вЂќ

вЂњOf
ours?вЂќ
Theon
shrugged.
вЂњTodric.
I
killed
him
for
getting
drunk
and
fighting
over
loot.вЂќ

вЂњSome
men
are
born
to
be
killed.вЂќ
A
lesser
man
might
have
been
afraid
to
show
a
smile
as
frightening
as
his,
yet
Dagmer
grinned
more
often
and
more
broadly
than
Lord
Balon
ever
had.

Ugly
as
it
was,
that
smile
brought
back
a
hundred
memories.
Theon
had
seen
it
often
as
a
boy,
when
heвЂ™d
jumped
a
horse
over
a
mossy
wall,
or
flung
an
axe
and
split
a
target
square.
HeвЂ™d
seen
it
when
he
blocked
a
blow
from
DagmerвЂ™s
sword,
when
he
put
an
arrow
through
a
seagull
on
the
wing,
when
he
took
the
tiller
in
hand
and
guided
a
longship
safely
through
a
snarl
of
foaming
rocks.
He
gave
me
more
smiles
than
my
father
and
Eddard
Stark
together.
Even
RobbвЂ¦
he
ought
to
have
won
a
smile
the
day
heвЂ™d
saved
Bran
from
that
wildling,
but
instead
heвЂ™d
gotten
a
scolding,
as
if
he
were
some
cook
whoвЂ™d
burned
the
stew.

вЂњYou
and
I
must
talk,
Uncle,вЂќ
Theon
said.
Dagmer
was
no
true
uncle,
only
a
sworn
man
with
perhaps
a
pinch
of
Greyjoy
blood
four
or
five
lives
back,
and
that
from
the
wrong
side
of
the
blanket.
Yet
Theon
had
always
called
him
uncle
nonetheless.

вЂњCome
onto
my
deck,
then.вЂќ
There
were
no
mвЂ™lords
from
Dagmer,
not
when
he
stood
on
his
own
deck.
On
the
Iron
Islands,
every
captain
was
a
king
aboard
his
own
ship.

He
climbed
the
plank
to
the
deck
of
the
Foamdrinker
in
four
long
strides,
and
Dagmer
led
him
back
to
the
cramped
aft
cabin,
where
the
old
man
poured
a
horn
of
sour
ale
and
offered
Theon
the
same.
He
declined.
вЂњWe
did
not
capture
enough
horses.
A
few,
butвЂ¦
well,
IвЂ™ll
make
do
with
what
I
have,
I
suppose.
Fewer
men
means
more
glory.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
need
do
we
have
of
horses?вЂќ
Like
most
ironmen,
Dagmer
preferred
to
fight
on
foot
or
from
the
deck
of
a
ship.
вЂњHorses
will
only
shit
on
our
decks
and
get
in
our
way.вЂќ

вЂњIf
we
sailed,
yes,вЂќ
Theon
admitted.
вЂњI
have
another
plan.вЂќ
He
watched
the
other
carefully
to
see
how
he
would
take
that.
Without
the
Cleftjaw
he
could
not
hope
to
succeed.
Command
or
no,
the
men
would
never
follow
him
if
both
Aeron
and
Dagmer
opposed
him,
and
he
had
no
hope
of
winning
over
the
sour-faced
priest.

вЂњYour
lord
father
commanded
us
to
harry
the
coast,
no
more.вЂќ
Eyes
pale
as
sea
foam
watched
Theon
from
under
those
shaggy
white
eyebrows.
Was
it
disapproval
he
saw
there,
or
a
spark
of
interest?
The
latter,
he
thoughtвЂ¦
hopedвЂ¦

вЂњYou
are
my
fatherвЂ™s
man.вЂќ

вЂњHis
best
man,
and
always
have
been.вЂќ

Pride,
Theon
thought.
He
is
proud,
I
must
use
that,
his
pride
will
be
the
key.
вЂњThere
is
no
man
in
the
Iron
Islands
half
so
skilled
with
spear
or
sword.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
been
too
long
away,
boy.
When
you
left,
it
was
as
you
say,
but
I
am
grown
old
in
Lord
GreyjoyвЂ™s
service.
The
singers
call
Andrik
best
now.
Andrik
the
Unsmiling,
they
name
him.
A
giant
of
a
man.
He
serves
Lord
Drumm
of
Old
Wyk.
And
Black
Lorren
and
Qarl
the
Maid
are
near
as
dread.вЂќ

вЂњThis
Andrik
may
be
a
great
fighter,
but
men
do
not
fear
him
as
they
fear
you.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
thatвЂ™s
so,вЂќ
Dagmer
said.
The
fingers
curled
around
the
drinking
horn
were
heavy
with
rings,
gold
and
silver
and
bronze,
set
with
chunks
of
sapphire
and
garnet
and
dragonglass.
He
had
paid
the
iron
price
for
every
one,
Theon
knew.

вЂњIf
I
had
a
man
like
you
in
my
service,
I
should
not
waste
him
on
this
childвЂ™s
business
of
harrying
and
burning.
This
is
no
work
for
Lord
BalonвЂ™s
best
manвЂ¦вЂќ

DagmerвЂ™s
grin
twisted
his
lips
apart
and
showed
the
brown
splinters
of
his
teeth.
вЂњNor
for
his
trueborn
son?вЂќ
He
hooted.
вЂњI
know
you
too
well,
Theon.
I
saw
you
take
your
first
step,
helped
you
bend
your
first
bow.
вЂ™Tis
not
me
who
feels
wasted.вЂќ

вЂњBy
rights
I
should
have
my
sisterвЂ™s
command,вЂќ
he
admitted,
uncomfortably
aware
of
how
peevish
that
sounded.

вЂњYou
take
this
business
too
hard,
boy.
It
is
only
that
your
lord
father
does
not
know
you.
With
your
brothers
dead
and
you
taken
by
the
wolves,
your
sister
was
his
solace.
He
learned
to
rely
on
her,
and
she
has
never
failed
him.вЂќ

вЂњNor
have
I.
The
Starks
knew
my
worth.
I
was
one
of
Brynden
BlackfishвЂ™s
picked
scouts,
and
I
charged
with
the
first
wave
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
I
was
that
close
to
crossing
swords
with
the
Kingslayer
himself.вЂќ
Theon
held
his
hands
two
feet
apart.
вЂњDaryn
Hornwood
came
between
us,
and
died
for
it.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
do
you
tell
me
this?вЂќ
Dagmer
asked.
вЂњIt
was
me
who
put
your
first
sword
in
your
hand.
I
know
you
are
no
craven.вЂќ

вЂњDoes
my
father?вЂќ

The
hoary
old
warrior
looked
as
if
he
had
bitten
into
something
he
did
not
like
the
taste
of.
вЂњIt
is
onlyвЂ¦
Theon,
the
Boy
Wolf
is
your
friend,
and
these
Starks
had
you
for
ten
years.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
no
Stark.вЂќ
Lord
Eddard
saw
to
that.
вЂњI
am
a
Greyjoy,
and
I
mean
to
be
my
fatherвЂ™s
heir.
How
can
I
do
that
unless
I
prove
myself
with
some
great
deed?вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
young.
Other
wars
will
come,
and
you
shall
do
your
great
deeds.
For
now,
we
are
commanded
to
harry
the
Stony
Shore.вЂќ

вЂњLet
my
uncle
Aeron
see
to
it.
IвЂ™ll
give
him
six
ships,
all
but
Foamdrinker
and
Sea
Bitch,
and
he
can
burn
and
drown
to
his
godвЂ™s
surfeit.вЂќ

вЂњThe
command
was
given
you,
not
Aeron
Damphair.вЂќ

вЂњSo
long
as
the
harrying
is
done,
what
does
it
matter?
No
priest
could
do
what
I
mean
to,
nor
what
I
ask
of
you.
I
have
a
task
that
only
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
can
accomplish.вЂќ

Dagmer
took
a
long
draught
from
his
horn.
вЂњTell
me.вЂќ

He
is
tempted,
Theon
thought.
He
likes
this
reaverвЂ™s
work
no
better
than
I
do.
вЂњIf
my
sister
can
take
a
castle,
so
can
I.вЂќ

вЂњAsha
has
four
or
five
times
the
men
we
do.вЂќ

Theon
allowed
himself
a
sly
smile.
вЂњBut
we
have
four
times
the
wits,
and
five
times
the
courage.вЂќ

вЂњYour
fatherвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”will
thank
me,
when
I
hand
him
his
kingdom.
I
mean
to
do
a
deed
that
the
harpers
will
sing
of
for
a
thousand
years.вЂќ

He
knew
that
would
give
Dagmer
pause.
A
singer
had
made
a
song
about
the
axe
that
cracked
his
jaw
in
half,
and
the
old
man
loved
to
hear
it.
Whenever
he
was
in
his
cups
he
would
call
for
a
reaving
song,
something
loud
and
stormy
that
told
of
dead
heroes
and
deeds
of
wild
valor.
His
hair
is
white
and
his
teeth
are
rotten,
but
he
still
has
a
taste
for
glory.

вЂњWhat
would
my
part
be
in
this
scheme
of
yours,
boy?вЂќ
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
asked
after
a
long
silence,
and
Theon
knew
he
had
won.

вЂњTo
strike
terror
into
the
heart
of
the
foe,
as
only
one
of
your
name
could
do.
YouвЂ™ll
take
the
great
part
of
our
force
and
march
on
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square.
Helman
Tallhart
took
his
best
men
south,
and
Benfred
died
here
with
their
sons.
His
uncle
Leobald
will
remain,
with
some
small
garrison.вЂќ
If
I
had
been
able
to
question
Benfred,
I
would
know
just
how
small.
вЂњMake
no
secret
of
your
approach.
Sing
all
the
brave
songs
you
like.
I
want
them
to
close
their
gates.вЂќ

вЂњIs
this
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
a
strong
keep?вЂќ

вЂњStrong
enough.
The
walls
are
stone,
thirty
feet
high,
with
square
towers
at
each
corner
and
a
square
keep
within.вЂќ

вЂњStone
walls
cannot
be
fired.
How
are
we
to
take
them?
We
do
not
have
the
numbers
to
storm
even
a
small
castle.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
make
camp
outside
their
walls
and
set
to
building
catapults
and
siege
engines.вЂќ

вЂњThat
is
not
the
Old
Way.
Have
you
forgotten?
Ironmen
fight
with
swords
and
axes,
not
by
flinging
rocks.
There
is
no
glory
in
starving
out
a
foeman.вЂќ

вЂњLeobald
will
not
know
that.
When
he
sees
you
raising
siege
towers,
his
old
womanвЂ™s
blood
will
run
cold,
and
he
will
bleat
for
help.
Stay
your
archers,
Uncle,
and
let
the
raven
fly.
The
castellan
at
Winterfell
is
a
brave
man,
but
age
has
stiffened
his
wits
as
well
as
his
limbs.
When
he
learns
that
one
of
his
kingвЂ™s
bannermen
is
under
attack
by
the
fearsome
Dagmer
Cleftjaw,
he
will
summon
his
strength
and
ride
to
TallhartвЂ™s
aid.
It
is
his
duty.
Ser
Rodrik
is
nothing
if
not
dutiful.вЂќ

вЂњAny
force
he
summons
will
be
larger
than
mine,вЂќ
Dagmer
said,
вЂњand
these
old
knights
are
more
cunning
than
you
think,
or
they
would
never
have
lived
to
see
their
first
grey
hair.
You
set
us
a
battle
we
cannot
hope
to
win,
Theon.
This
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
will
never
fall.вЂќ

Theon
smiled.
вЂњItвЂ™s
not
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
I
mean
to
take.вЂќ





ARYA

Confusion
and
clangor
ruled
the
castle.
Men
stood
on
the
beds
of
wagons
loading
casks
of
wine,
sacks
of
flour,
and
bundles
of
new-fletched
arrows.
Smiths
straightened
swords,
knocked
dents
from
breastplates,
and
shoed
destriers
and
pack
mules
alike.
Mail
shirts
were
tossed
in
barrels
of
sand
and
rolled
across
the
lumpy
surface
of
the
Flowstone
Yard
to
scour
them
clean.
WeeseвЂ™s
women
had
twenty
cloaks
to
mend,
a
hundred
more
to
wash.
The
high
and
humble
crowded
into
the
sept
together
to
pray.
Outside
the
walls,
tents
and
pavilions
were
coming
down.
Squires
tossed
pails
of
water
over
cookfires,
while
soldiers
took
out
their
oilstones
to
give
their
blades
one
last
good
lick.
The
noise
was
a
swelling
tide:
horses
blowing
and
whickering,
lords
shouting
commands,
men-at-arms
trading
curses,
camp
followers
squabbling.

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
marching
at
last.

Ser
Addam
Marbrand
was
the
first
of
the
captains
to
depart,
a
day
before
the
rest.
He
made
a
gallant
show
of
it,
riding
a
spirited
red
courser
whose
mane
was
the
same
copper
color
as
the
long
hair
that
streamed
past
Ser
AddamвЂ™s
shoulders.
The
horse
was
barded
in
bronze-colored
trappings
dyed
to
match
the
riderвЂ™s
cloak
and
emblazoned
with
the
burning
tree.
Some
of
the
castle
women
sobbed
to
see
him
go.
Weese
said
he
was
a
great
horseman
and
sword
fighter,
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
most
daring
commander.

I
hope
he
dies,
Arya
thought
as
she
watched
him
ride
out
the
gate,
his
men
streaming
after
him
in
a
double
column.
I
hope
they
all
die.
They
were
going
to
fight
Robb,
she
knew.
Listening
to
the
talk
as
she
went
about
her
work,
Arya
had
learned
that
Robb
had
won
some
great
victory
in
the
west.
HeвЂ™d
burned
Lannisport,
some
said,
or
else
he
meant
to
burn
it.
HeвЂ™d
captured
Casterly
Rock
and
put
everyone
to
the
sword,
or
he
was
besieging
the
Golden
ToothвЂ¦
but
something
had
happened,
that
much
was
certain.

Weese
had
her
running
messages
from
dawn
to
dusk.
Some
of
them
even
took
her
beyond
the
castle
walls,
out
into
the
mud
and
madness
of
the
camp.
I
could
flee,
she
thought
as
a
wagon
rumbled
past
her.
I
could
hop
on
the
back
of
a
wagon
and
hide,
or
fall
in
with
the
camp
followers,
no
one
would
stop
me.
She
might
have
done
it
if
not
for
Weese.
HeвЂ™d
told
them
more
than
once
what
heвЂ™d
do
to
anyone
who
tried
to
run
off
on
him.
вЂњIt
wonвЂ™t
be
no
beating,
oh,
no.
I
wonвЂ™t
lay
a
finger
on
you.
IвЂ™ll
just
save
you
for
the
Qohorik,
yes
I
will,
IвЂ™ll
save
you
for
the
Crippler.
Vargo
Hoat
his
name
is,
and
when
he
gets
back
heвЂ™ll
cut
off
your
feet.вЂќ
Maybe
if
Weese
were
dead,
Arya
thoughtвЂ¦
but
not
when
she
was
with
him.
He
could
look
at
you
and
smell
what
you
were
thinking,
he
always
said
so.

Weese
never
imagined
she
could
read,
though,
so
he
never
bothered
to
seal
the
messages
he
gave
her.
Arya
peeked
at
them
all,
but
they
were
never
anything
good,
just
stupid
stuff
sending
this
cart
to
the
granary
and
that
one
to
the
armory.
One
was
a
demand
for
payment
on
a
gambling
debt,
but
the
knight
she
gave
it
to
couldnвЂ™t
read.
When
she
told
him
what
it
said
he
tried
to
hit
her,
but
Arya
ducked
under
the
blow,
snatched
a
silver-banded
drinking
horn
off
his
saddle,
and
darted
away.
The
knight
roared
and
came
after
her,
but
she
slid
between
two
wayns,
wove
through
a
crowd
of
archers,
and
jumped
a
latrine
trench.
In
his
mail
he
couldnвЂ™t
keep
up.
When
she
gave
the
horn
to
Weese,
he
told
her
that
a
smart
little
Weasel
like
her
deserved
a
reward.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
got
my
eye
on
a
plump
crisp
capon
to
sup
on
tonight.
WeвЂ™ll
share
it,
me
and
you.
YouвЂ™ll
like
that.вЂќ

Everywhere
she
went,
Arya
searched
for
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
wanting
to
whisper
another
name
to
him
before
those
she
hated
were
all
gone
out
of
her
reach,
but
amidst
the
chaos
and
confusion
the
Lorathi
sellsword
was
not
to
be
found.
He
still
owed
her
two
deaths,
and
she
was
worried
she
would
never
get
them
if
he
rode
off
to
battle
with
the
rest.
Finally
she
worked
up
the
courage
to
ask
one
of
the
gate
guards
if
heвЂ™d
gone.
вЂњOne
of
LorchвЂ™s
men,
is
he?вЂќ
the
man
said.
вЂњHe
wonвЂ™t
be
going,
then.
His
lordshipвЂ™s
named
Ser
Amory
castellan
of
Harrenhal.
That
whole
lotвЂ™s
staying
right
here,
to
hold
the
castle.
The
Bloody
Mummers
will
be
left
as
well,
to
do
the
foraging.
That
goat
Vargo
Hoat
is
like
to
spit,
him
and
Lorch
have
always
hated
each
other.вЂќ

The
Mountain
would
be
leaving
with
Lord
Tywin,
though.
He
would
command
the
van
in
battle,
which
meant
that
Dunsen,
Polliver,
and
Raff
would
all
slip
between
her
fingers
unless
she
could
find
Jaqen
and
have
him
kill
one
of
them
before
they
left.

вЂњWeasel,вЂќ
Weese
said
that
afternoon.
вЂњGet
to
the
armory
and
tell
Lucan
that
Ser
Lyonel
notched
his
sword
in
practice
and
needs
a
new
one.
HereвЂ™s
his
mark.вЂќ
He
handed
her
a
square
of
paper.
вЂњBe
quick
about
it
now,
heвЂ™s
to
ride
with
Ser
Kevan
Lannister.вЂќ

Arya
took
the
paper
and
ran.
The
armory
adjoined
the
castle
smithy,
a
long
high-roofed
tunnel
of
a
building
with
twenty
forges
built
into
its
walls
and
long
stone
water
troughs
for
tempering
the
steel.
Half
of
the
forges
were
at
work
when
she
entered.
The
walls
rang
with
the
sound
of
hammers,
and
burly
men
in
leather
aprons
stood
sweating
in
the
sullen
heat
as
they
bent
over
bellows
and
anvils.
When
she
spied
Gendry,
his
bare
chest
was
slick
with
sweat,
but
the
blue
eyes
under
the
heavy
black
hair
had
the
stubborn
look
she
remembered.
Arya
didnвЂ™t
know
that
she
even
wanted
to
talk
to
him.
It
was
his
fault
theyвЂ™d
all
been
caught.
вЂњWhich
one
is
Lucan?вЂќ
She
thrust
out
the
paper.
вЂњIвЂ™m
to
get
a
new
sword
for
Ser
Lyonel.вЂќ

вЂњNever
mind
about
Ser
Lyonel.вЂќ
He
drew
her
aside
by
the
arm.
вЂњLast
night
Hot
Pie
asked
me
if
I
heard
you
yell
Winterfell
back
at
the
holdfast,
when
we
were
all
fighting
on
the
wall.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
did!вЂќ

вЂњYes
you
did.
I
heard
you
too.вЂќ

вЂњEveryone
was
yelling
stuff,вЂќ
Arya
said
defensively.
вЂњHot
Pie
yelled
hot
pie.
He
must
have
yelled
it
a
hundred
times.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
what
you
yelled
that
matters.
I
told
Hot
Pie
he
should
clean
the
wax
out
of
his
ears,
that
all
you
yelled
was
Go
to
hell!
If
he
asks
you,
you
better
say
the
same.вЂќ

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
she
said,
even
though
she
thought
go
to
hell
was
a
stupid
thing
to
yell.
She
didnвЂ™t
dare
tell
Hot
Pie
who
she
really
was.
Maybe
I
should
say
Hot
PieвЂ™s
name
to
Jaqen.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
get
Lucan,вЂќ
Gendry
said.

Lucan
grunted
at
the
writing
(though
Arya
did
not
think
he
could
read
it),
and
pulled
down
a
heavy
longsword.
вЂњThis
is
too
good
for
that
oaf,
and
you
tell
him
I
said
so,вЂќ
he
said
as
he
gave
her
the
blade.

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
she
lied.
If
she
did
any
such
thing,
Weese
would
beat
her
bloody.
Lucan
could
deliver
his
own
insults.

The
longsword
was
a
lot
heavier
than
Needle
had
been,
but
Arya
liked
the
feel
of
it.
The
weight
of
steel
in
her
hands
made
her
feel
stronger.
Maybe
IвЂ™m
not
a
water
dancer
yet,
but
IвЂ™m
not
a
mouse
either.
A
mouse
couldnвЂ™t
use
a
sword
but
I
can.
The
gates
were
open,
soldiers
coming
and
going,
drays
rolling
in
empty
and
going
out
creaking
and
swaying
under
their
loads.
She
thought
about
going
to
the
stables
and
telling
them
that
Ser
Lyonel
wanted
a
new
horse.
She
had
the
paper,
the
stableboys
wouldnвЂ™t
be
able
to
read
it
any
better
than
Lucan
had.
I
could
take
the
horse
and
the
sword
and
just
ride
out.
If
the
guards
tried
to
stop
me
IвЂ™d
show
them
the
paper
and
say
I
was
bringing
everything
to
Ser
Lyonel.
She
had
no
notion
what
Ser
Lyonel
looked
like
or
where
to
find
him,
though.
If
they
questioned
her,
theyвЂ™d
know,
and
then
WeeseвЂ¦
WeeseвЂ¦

As
she
chewed
her
lip,
trying
not
to
think
about
how
it
would
feel
to
have
her
feet
cut
off,
a
group
of
archers
in
leather
jerkins
and
iron
helms
went
past,
their
bows
slung
across
their
shoulders.
Arya
heard
snatches
of
their
talk.

вЂњвЂ¦giants
I
tell
you,
heвЂ™s
got
giants
twenty
foot
tall
come
down
from
beyond
the
Wall,
follow
him
like
dogsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦not
natural,
coming
on
them
so
fast,
in
the
night
and
all.
HeвЂ™s
more
wolf
than
man,
all
them
Starks
areвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦shit
on
your
wolves
and
giants,
the
boyвЂ™d
piss
his
pants
if
he
knew
we
was
coming.
He
wasnвЂ™t
man
enough
to
march
on
Harrenhal,
was
he?
Ran
tвЂ™other
way,
didnвЂ™t
he?
HeвЂ™d
run
now
if
he
knew
what
was
best
for
him.вЂќ

вЂњSo
you
say,
but
might
be
the
boy
knows
something
we
donвЂ™t,
maybe
itвЂ™s
us
ought
to
be
runвЂ¦вЂќ

Yes,
Arya
thought.
Yes,
itвЂ™s
you
who
ought
to
run,
you
and
Lord
Tywin
and
the
Mountain
and
Ser
Addam
and
Ser
Amory
and
stupid
Ser
Lyonel
whoever
he
is,
all
of
you
better
run
or
my
brother
will
kill
you,
heвЂ™s
a
Stark,
heвЂ™s
more
wolf
than
man,
and
so
am
I.

вЂњWeasel.вЂќ
WeeseвЂ™s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip.
She
never
saw
where
he
came
from,
but
suddenly
he
was
right
in
front
of
her.
вЂњGive
me
that.
Took
you
long
enough.вЂќ
He
snatched
the
sword
from
her
fingers,
and
dealt
her
a
stinging
slap
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњNext
time
be
quicker
about
it.вЂќ

For
a
moment
she
had
been
a
wolf
again,
but
WeeseвЂ™s
slap
took
it
all
away
and
left
her
with
nothing
but
the
taste
of
her
own
blood
in
her
mouth.
SheвЂ™d
bitten
her
tongue
when
he
hit
her.
She
hated
him
for
that.

вЂњYou
want
another?вЂќ
Weese
demanded.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
get
it
too.
IвЂ™ll
have
none
of
your
insolent
looks.
Get
down
to
the
brewhouse
and
tell
Tuffleberry
that
I
have
two
dozen
barrels
for
him,
but
he
better
send
his
lads
to
fetch
them
or
IвЂ™ll
find
someone
wants
вЂ™em
worse.вЂќ
Arya
started
off,
but
not
quick
enough
for
Weese.
вЂњYou
run
if
you
want
to
eat
tonight,вЂќ
he
shouted,
his
promises
of
a
plump
crisp
capon
already
forgotten.
вЂњAnd
donвЂ™t
be
getting
lost
again,
or
I
swear
IвЂ™ll
beat
you
bloody.вЂќ

You
wonвЂ™t,
Arya
thought.
You
wonвЂ™t
ever
again.
But
she
ran.
The
old
gods
of
the
north
must
have
been
guiding
her
steps.
Halfway
to
the
brewhouse,
as
she
passing
under
the
stone
bridge
that
arched
between
WidowвЂ™s
Tower
and
Kingspyre,
she
heard
harsh,
growling
laughter.
Rorge
came
around
a
corner
with
three
other
men,
the
manticore
badge
of
Ser
Amory
sewn
over
their
hearts.
When
he
saw
her,
he
stopped
and
grinned,
showing
a
mouthful
of
crooked
brown
teeth
under
the
leather
flap
he
wore
sometimes
to
cover
the
hole
in
his
face.
вЂњYorenвЂ™s
little
cunt,вЂќ
he
called
her.
вЂњGuess
we
know
why
that
black
bastard
wanted
you
on
the
Wall,
donвЂ™t
we?вЂќ
He
laughed
again,
and
the
others
laughed
with
him.
вЂњWhereвЂ™s
your
stick
now?вЂќ
Rorge
demanded
suddenly,
the
smile
gone
as
quick
as
it
had
come.
вЂњSeems
to
me
I
promised
to
fuck
you
with
it.вЂќ
He
took
a
step
toward
her.
Arya
edged
backward.
вЂњNot
so
brave
now
that
IвЂ™m
not
in
chains,
are
you?вЂќ

вЂњI
saved
you.вЂќ
She
kept
a
good
yard
between
them,
ready
to
run
quick
as
a
snake
if
he
made
a
grab
for
her.

вЂњOwe
you
another
fucking
for
that,
seems
like.
Did
Yoren
pump
your
cunny,
or
did
he
like
that
tight
little
ass
better?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
looking
for
Jaqen,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
message.вЂќ

Rorge
halted.
Something
in
his
eyesвЂ¦
could
it
be
that
he
was
scared
of
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar?
вЂњThe
bathhouse.
Get
out
of
my
way.вЂќ

Arya
whirled
and
ran,
swift
as
a
deer,
her
feet
flying
over
the
cobbles
all
the
way
to
the
bathhouse,
She
found
Jaqen
soaking
in
a
tub,
steam
rising
around
him
as
a
serving
girl
sluiced
hot
water
over
his
head.
His
long
hair,
red
on
one
side
and
white
on
the
other,
fell
down
across
his
shoulders,
wet
and
heavy.

She
crept
up
quiet
as
a
shadow,
but
he
opened
his
eyes
all
the
same.
вЂњShe
steals
in
on
little
mice
feet,
but
a
man
hears,вЂќ
he
said.
How
could
he
hear
me?
she
wondered,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
heard
that
as
well.
вЂњThe
scuff
of
leather
on
stone
sings
loud
as
warhorns
to
a
man
with
open
ears.
Clever
girls
go
barefoot.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
a
message.вЂќ
Arya
eyed
the
serving
girl
uncertainly.
When
she
did
not
seem
likely
to
go
away,
she
leaned
in
until
her
mouth
was
almost
touching
his
ear.
вЂњWeese,вЂќ
she
whispered.

Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
closed
his
eyes
again,
floating
languid,
half-asleep.
вЂњTell
his
lordship
a
man
shall
attend
him
at
his
leisure.вЂќ
His
hand
moved
suddenly,
splashing
hot
water
at
her,
and
Arya
had
to
leap
back
to
keep
from
getting
drenched.

When
she
told
Tuffleberry
what
Weese
had
said,
the
brewer
cursed
loudly.
вЂњYou
tell
Weese
my
lads
got
duties
to
attend
to,
and
you
tell
him
heвЂ™s
a
pox-ridden
bastard
too,
and
the
seven
hells
will
freeze
over
before
he
gets
another
horn
of
my
ale.
IвЂ™ll
have
them
barrels
within
the
hour
or
Lord
Tywin
will
hear
of
it,
see
if
he
donвЂ™t.вЂќ

Weese
cursed
too
when
Arya
brought
back
that
message,
even
though
she
left
out
the
pox-ridden
bastard
part.
He
fumed
and
threatened,
but
in
the
end
he
rounded
up
six
men
and
sent
them
off
grumbling
to
fetch
the
barrels
down
to
the
brewhouse.

Supper
that
evening
was
a
thin
stew
of
barley,
onion,
and
carrots,
with
a
wedge
of
stale
brown
bread.
One
of
the
women
had
taken
to
sleeping
in
WeeseвЂ™s
bed,
and
she
got
a
piece
of
ripe
blue
cheese
as
well,
and
a
wing
off
the
capon
that
Weese
had
spoken
of
that
morning.
He
ate
the
rest
himself,
the
grease
running
down
in
a
shiny
line
through
the
boils
that
festered
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth.
The
bird
was
almost
gone
when
he
glanced
up
from
his
trencher
and
saw
Arya
staring.
вЂњWeasel,
come
here.вЂќ

A
few
mouthfuls
of
dark
meat
still
clung
to
one
thigh.
He
forgot,
but
now
heвЂ™s
remembered,
Arya
thought.
It
made
her
feel
bad
for
telling
Jaqen
to
kill
him.
She
got
off
the
bench
and
went
to
the
head
of
the
table.

вЂњI
saw
you
looking
at
me.вЂќ
Weese
wiped
his
fingers
on
the
front
of
her
shift.
Then
he
grabbed
her
throat
with
one
hand
and
slapped
her
with
the
other.
вЂњWhat
did
I
tell
you?вЂќ
He
slapped
her
again,
backhand.
вЂњKeep
those
eyes
to
yourself,
or
next
time
IвЂ™ll
spoon
one
out
and
feed
it
to
my
bitch.вЂќ
A
shove
sent
her
stumbling
to
the
floor.
Her
hem
caught
on
a
loose
nail
in
the
splintered
wooden
bench
and
ripped
as
she
fell.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
mend
that
before
you
sleep,вЂќ
Weese
announced
as
he
pulled
the
last
bit
of
meat
off
the
capon.
When
he
was
finished
he
sucked
his
fingers
noisily,
and
threw
the
bones
to
his
ugly
spotted
dog.

вЂњWeese,вЂќ
Arya
whispered
that
night
as
she
bent
over
the
tear
in
her
shift.
вЂњDunsen,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling,вЂќ
she
said,
calling
a
name
every
time
she
pushed
the
bone
needle
through
the
undyed
wool.
вЂњThe
Tickler
and
the
Hound.
Ser
Gregor,
Ser
Amory,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
King
Joffrey,
Queen
Cersei.вЂќ
She
wondered
how
much
longer
she
would
have
to
include
Weese
in
her
prayer,
and
drifted
off
to
sleep
dreaming
that
on
the
morrow,
when
she
woke,
heвЂ™d
be
dead.

But
it
was
the
sharp
toe
of
WeeseвЂ™s
boot
that
woke
her,
as
ever.
The
main
strength
of
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
host
would
ride
this
day,
he
told
them
as
they
broke
their
fast
on
oatcakes.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
none
of
you
be
thinking
how
easy
itвЂ™ll
be
here
once
mвЂ™lord
of
Lannister
is
gone,вЂќ
he
warned.
вЂњThe
castle
wonвЂ™t
grow
no
smaller,
I
promise
you
that,
only
now
thereвЂ™ll
be
fewer
hands
to
tend
to
it.
You
lot
of
slugabeds
are
going
to
learn
what
work
is
now,
yes
you
are.вЂќ

Not
from
you.
Arya
picked
at
her
oaten
cake.
Weese
frowned
at
her,
as
if
he
smelled
her
secret.
Quickly
she
dropped
her
gaze
to
her
food,
and
dared
not
raise
her
eyes
again.

Pale
light
filled
the
yard
when
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
took
his
leave
of
Harrenhal.
Arya
watched
from
an
arched
window
halfway
up
the
Wailing
Tower.
His
charger
wore
a
blanket
of
enameled
crimson
scales
and
gilded
crinet
and
chamfron,
while
Lord
Tywin
himself
sported
a
thick
ermine
cloak.
His
brother
Ser
Kevan
looked
near
as
splendid.
No
less
than
four
standard-bearers
went
before
them,
carrying
huge
crimson
banners
emblazoned
with
the
golden
lion.
Behind
the
Lannisters
came
their
great
lords
and
captains.
Their
banners
flared
and
flapped,
a
pageant
of
color:
red
ox
and
golden
mountain,
purple
unicorn
and
bantam
rooster,
brindled
boar
and
badger,
a
silver
ferret
and
a
juggler
in
motley,
stars
and
sunbursts,
peacock
and
panther,
chevron
and
dagger,
black
hood
and
blue
beetle
and
green
arrow.

Last
of
all
came
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
in
his
grey
plate
steel,
astride
a
stallion
as
bad-tempered
as
his
rider.
Polliver
rode
beside
him,
with
the
black
dog
standard
in
his
hand
and
GendryвЂ™s
horned
helm
on
his
head.
He
was
a
tall
man,
but
he
looked
no
more
than
a
half-grown
boy
when
he
rode
in
his
masterвЂ™s
shadow.

A
shiver
crept
up
AryaвЂ™s
spine
as
she
watched
them
pass
under
the
great
iron
portcullis
of
Harrenhal.
Suddenly
she
knew
that
she
had
made
a
terrible
mistake.
IвЂ™m
so
stupid,
she
thought.
Weese
did
not
matter,
no
more
than
Chiswyck
had.
These
were
the
men
who
mattered,
the
ones
she
ought
to
have
killed.
Last
night
she
could
have
whispered
any
of
them
dead,
if
only
she
hadnвЂ™t
been
so
mad
at
Weese
for
hitting
her
and
lying
about
the
capon.
Lord
Tywin,
why
didnвЂ™t
I
say
Lord
Tywin?

Perhaps
it
was
not
too
late
to
change
her
mind.
Weese
was
not
killed
yet.
If
she
could
find
Jaqen,
tell
himвЂ¦

Hurriedly,
Arya
ran
down
the
twisting
steps,
her
chores
forgotten.
She
heard
the
rattle
of
chains
as
the
portcullis
was
slowly
lowered,
its
spikes
sinking
deep
into
the
groundвЂ¦
and
then
another
sound,
a
shriek
of
pain
and
fear.

A
dozen
people
got
there
before
her,
though
none
was
coming
any
too
close.
Arya
squirmed
between
them.
Weese
was
sprawled
across
the
cobbles,
his
throat
a
red
ruin,
eyes
gaping
sightlessly
up
at
a
bank
of
grey
cloud.
His
ugly
spotted
dog
stood
on
his
chest,
lapping
at
the
blood
pulsing
from
his
neck,
and
every
so
often
ripping
a
mouthful
of
flesh
out
of
the
dead
manвЂ™s
face.

Finally
someone
brought
a
crossbow
and
shot
the
spotted
dog
dead
while
she
was
worrying
at
one
of
WeeseвЂ™s
ears.

вЂњDamnedest
thing,вЂќ
she
heard
a
man
say.
вЂњHe
had
that
bitch
dog
since
she
was
a
pup.вЂќ

вЂњThis
place
is
cursed,вЂќ
the
man
with
the
crossbow
said.

вЂњItвЂ™s
HarrenвЂ™s
ghost,
thatвЂ™s
what
it
is,вЂќ
said
Goodwife
Amabel.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
not
sleep
here
another
night,
I
swear
it.вЂќ

Arya
lifted
her
gaze
from
the
dead
man
and
his
dead
dog.
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
was
leaning
up
against
the
side
of
the
Wailing
Tower.
When
he
saw
her
looking,
he
lifted
a
hand
to
his
face
and
laid
two
fingers
casually
against
his
cheek.





CATELYN

Two
days
ride
from
Riverrun,
a
scout
spied
them
watering
their
horses
beside
a
muddy
steam.
Catelyn
had
never
been
so
glad
to
see
the
twin
tower
badge
of
House
Frey.

When
she
asked
him
to
lead
them
to
her
uncle,
he
said,
вЂњThe
Blackfish
is
gone
west
with
the
king,
my
lady.
Martyn
Rivers
commands
the
outriders
in
his
stead.вЂќ

вЂњI
see.вЂќ
She
had
met
Rivers
at
the
Twins;
a
baseborn
son
of
Lord
Walder
Frey,
half
brother
to
Ser
Perwyn.
It
did
not
surprise
her
to
learn
that
Robb
had
struck
at
the
heart
of
Lannister
power;
clearly
he
had
been
contemplating
just
that
when
he
sent
her
away
to
treat
with
Renly.
вЂњWhere
is
Rivers
now?вЂќ

вЂњHis
camp
is
two
hours
ride,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњTake
us
to
him,вЂќ
she
commanded.
Brienne
helped
her
back
into
her
saddle,
and
they
set
out
at
once.

вЂњHave
you
come
from
Bitterbridge,
my
lady?вЂќ
the
scout
asked.

вЂњNo.вЂќ
She
had
not
dared.
With
Renly
dead,
Catelyn
had
been
uncertain
of
the
reception
she
might
receive
from
his
young
widow
and
her
protectors.
Instead
she
had
ridden
through
the
heart
of
the
war,
through
fertile
riverlands
turned
to
blackened
desert
by
the
fury
of
the
Lannisters,
and
each
night
her
scouts
brought
back
tales
that
made
her
ill.
вЂњLord
Renly
is
slain,вЂќ
she
added.

вЂњWeвЂ™d
hoped
that
tale
was
some
Lannister
lie,
orвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWould
that
it
were.
My
brother
commands
in
Riverrun?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
my
lady.
His
Grace
left
Ser
Edmure
to
hold
Riverrun
and
guard
his
rear.вЂќ

Gods
grant
him
the
strength
to
do
so,
Catelyn
thought.
And
the
wisdom
as
well.
вЂњIs
there
word
from
Robb
in
the
west?вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
not
heard?вЂќ
The
man
seemed
surprised.
вЂњHis
Grace
won
a
great
victory
at
Oxcross.
Ser
Stafford
Lannister
is
dead,
his
host
scattered.вЂќ

Ser
Wendel
Manderly
gave
a
whoop
of
pleasure,
but
Catelyn
only
nodded.
TomorrowвЂ™s
trials
concerned
her
more
than
yesterdayвЂ™s
triumphs.

Martyn
Rivers
had
made
his
camp
in
the
shell
of
a
shattered
holdfast,
beside
a
roofless
stable
and
a
hundred
fresh
graves.
He
went
to
one
knee
when
Catelyn
dismounted.
вЂњWell
met,
my
lady.
Your
brother
charged
us
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
your
party,
and
escort
you
back
to
Riverrun
in
all
haste
should
we
come
upon
you.вЂќ

Catelyn
scarce
liked
the
sound
of
that.
вЂњIs
it
my
father?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
my
lady.
Lord
Hoster
is
unchanged.вЂќ
Rivers
was
a
ruddy
man
with
scant
resemblance
to
his
half
brothers.
вЂњIt
is
only
that
we
feared
you
might
chance
upon
Lannister
scouts.
Lord
Tywin
has
left
Harrenhal
and
marches
west
with
all
his
power.вЂќ

вЂњRise,вЂќ
she
told
Rivers,
frowning.
Stannis
Baratheon
would
soon
be
on
the
march
as
well,
gods
help
them
all.
вЂњHow
long
until
Lord
Tywin
is
upon
us?вЂќ

вЂњThree
days,
perhaps
four,
it
is
hard
to
know.
We
have
eyes
out
along
all
the
roads,
but
it
would
be
best
not
to
linger.вЂќ

Nor
did
they.
Rivers
broke
his
camp
quickly
and
saddled
up
beside
her,
and
they
set
off
again,
near
fifty
strong
now,
flying
beneath
the
direwolf,
the
leaping
trout,
the
twin
towers.

Her
men
wanted
to
hear
more
of
RobbвЂ™s
victory
at
Oxcross,
and
Rivers
obliged.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
singer
come
to
Riverrun,
calls
himself
Rymund
the
Rhymer,
heвЂ™s
made
a
song
of
the
fight.
Doubtless
youвЂ™ll
hear
it
sung
tonight,
my
lady.
вЂWolf
in
the
NightвЂ™
this
Rymund
calls
it.вЂќ
He
went
on
to
tell
how
the
remnants
of
Ser
StaffordвЂ™s
host
had
fallen
back
on
Lannisport.
Without
siege
engines
there
was
no
way
to
storm
Casterly
Rock,
so
the
Young
Wolf
was
paying
the
Lannisters
back
in
kind
for
the
devastation
theyвЂ™d
inflicted
on
the
riverlands.
Lords
Karstark
and
Glover
were
raiding
along
the
coast,
Lady
Mormont
had
captured
thousands
of
cattle
and
was
driving
them
back
toward
Riverrun,
while
the
Greatjon
had
seized
the
gold
mines
at
Castamere,
NunnвЂ™s
Deep,
and
the
Pendric
Hills.
Ser
Wendel
laughed.
вЂњNothingвЂ™s
more
like
to
bring
a
Lannister
running
than
a
threat
to
his
gold.вЂќ

вЂњHow
did
the
king
ever
take
the
Tooth?вЂќ
Ser
Perwyn
Frey
asked
his
bastard
brother.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
a
hard
strong
keep,
and
it
commands
the
hill
road.вЂќ

вЂњHe
never
took
it.
He
slipped
around
it
in
the
night.
ItвЂ™s
said
the
direwolf
showed
him
the
way,
that
Grey
Wind
of
his.
The
beast
sniffed
out
a
goat
track
that
wound
down
a
defile
and
up
along
beneath
a
ridge,
a
crooked
and
stony
way,
yet
wide
enough
for
men
riding
single
file.
The
Lannisters
in
their
watchtowers
got
not
so
much
a
glimpse
of
them.вЂќ
Rivers
lowered
his
voice.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
some
say
that
after
the
battle,
the
king
cut
out
Stafford
LannisterвЂ™s
heart
and
fed
it
to
the
wolf.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
not
believe
such
tales,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
sharply.
вЂњMy
son
is
no
savage.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
my
lady.
Still,
itвЂ™s
no
more
than
the
beast
deserved.
That
is
no
common
wolf,
that
one.
The
GreatjonвЂ™s
been
heard
to
say
that
the
old
gods
of
the
north
sent
those
direwolves
to
your
children.вЂќ

Catelyn
remembered
the
day
when
her
boys
had
found
the
pups
in
the
late
summer
snows.
There
had
been
five,
three
male
and
two
female
for
the
five
trueborn
children
of
House
StarkвЂ¦
and
a
sixth,
white
of
fur
and
red
of
eye,
for
NedвЂ™s
bastard
son
Jon
Snow.
No
common
wolves,
she
thought.
No
indeed.

That
night
as
they
made
their
camp,
Brienne
sought
out
her
tent.
вЂњMy
lady,
you
are
safely
back
among
your
own
now,
a
dayвЂ™s
ride
from
your
brotherвЂ™s
castle.
Give
me
leave
to
go.вЂќ

Catelyn
should
not
have
been
surprised.
The
homely
young
woman
had
kept
to
herself
all
through
their
journey,
spending
most
of
her
time
with
the
horses,
brushing
out
their
coats
and
pulling
stones
from
their
shoes.
She
had
helped
Shadd
cook
and
clean
game
as
well,
and
soon
proved
that
she
could
hunt
as
well
as
any.
Any
task
Catelyn
asked
her
to
turn
her
hand
to,
Brienne
had
performed
deftly
and
without
complaint,
and
when
she
was
spoken
to
she
answered
politely,
but
she
never
chattered,
nor
wept,
nor
laughed.
She
had
ridden
with
them
every
day
and
slept
among
them
every
night
without
ever
truly
becoming
one
of
them.

It
was
the
same
when
she
was
with
Renly,
Catelyn
thought.
At
the
feast,
in
the
melee,
even
in
RenlyвЂ™s
pavilion
with
her
brothers
of
the
Rainbow
Guard.
There
are
walls
around
this
one
higher
than
WinterfellвЂ™s.

вЂњIf
you
left
us,
where
would
you
go?вЂќ
Catelyn
asked
her.

вЂњBack,вЂќ
Brienne
said.
вЂњTo
StormвЂ™s
End.вЂќ

вЂњAlone.вЂќ
It
was
not
a
question.

The
broad
face
was
a
pool
of
still
water,
giving
no
hint
of
what
might
live
in
the
depths
below.
вЂњYes.вЂќ

вЂњYou
mean
to
kill
Stannis.вЂќ

Brienne
closed
her
thick
callused
fingers
around
the
hilt
of
her
sword.

The
sword
that
had
been
his.
вЂњI
swore
a
vow.
Three
times
I
swore.
You
heard
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
did,вЂќ
Catelyn
admitted.
The
girl
had
kept
the
rainbow
cloak
when
she
discarded
the
rest
of
her
bloodstained
clothing,
she
knew.
BrienneвЂ™s
own
things
had
been
left
behind
during
their
flight,
and
she
had
been
forced
to
clothe
herself
in
odd
bits
of
Ser
WendelвЂ™s
spare
garb,
since
no
one
else
in
their
party
had
garments
large
enough
to
fit
her.
вЂњVows
should
be
kept,
I
agree,
but
Stannis
has
a
great
host
around
him,
and
his
own
guards
sworn
to
keep
him
safe.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
not
afraid
of
his
guards.
I
am
as
good
as
any
of
them.
I
should
never
have
fled.вЂќ

вЂњIs
that
what
troubles
you,
that
some
fool
might
call
you
craven?вЂќ
She
sighed.
вЂњRenlyвЂ™s
death
was
no
fault
of
youts.
You
served
him
valiantly,
but
when
you
seek
to
follow
him
into
the
earth,
you
serve
no
one.вЂќ
She
stretched
out
a
hand,
to
give
what
comfort
a
touch
could
give.
вЂњI
know
how
hard
it
isвЂ”вЂќ

Brienne
shook
off
her
hand.
вЂњNo
one
knows.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
wrong,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
sharply.
вЂњEvery
morning,
when
I
wake,
I
remember
that
Ned
is
gone.
I
have
no
skill
with
swords,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
I
do
not
dream
of
riding
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
and
wrapping
my
hands
around
Cersei
LannisterвЂ™s
white
throat
and
squeezing
until
her
face
turns
black.вЂќ

The
Beauty
raised
her
eyes,
the
only
part
of
her
that
was
truly
beautiful.
вЂњIf
you
dream
that,
why
would
you
seek
to
hold
me
back?
Is
it
because
of
what
Stannis
said
at
the
parley?вЂќ

Was
it?
Catelyn
glanced
across
the
camp.
Two
men
were
walking
sentry,
spears
in
hand.
вЂњI
was
taught
that
good
men
must
fight
evil
in
this
world,
and
RenlyвЂ™s
death
was
evil
beyond
all
doubt.
Yet
I
was
also
taught
that
the
gods
make
kings,
not
the
swords
of
men.
If
Stannis
is
our
rightful
kingвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
not.
Robert
was
never
the
rightful
king
either,
even
Renly
said
as
much.
Jaime
Lannister
murdered
the
rightful
king,
after
Robert
killed
his
lawful
heir
on
the
Trident.
Where
were
the
gods
then?
The
gods
donвЂ™t
care
about
men,
no
more
than
kings
care
about
peasants.вЂќ

вЂњA
good
king
does
care.вЂќ

вЂњLord
RenlyвЂ¦
His
Grace,
heвЂ¦
he
would
have
been
the
best
king,
my
lady,
he
was
so
good,
heвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
gone,
Brienne,вЂќ
she
said,
as
gently
as
she
could.
вЂњStannis
and
Joffrey
remainвЂ¦
and
so
does
my
son.вЂќ

вЂњHe
wouldnвЂ™tвЂ¦
youвЂ™d
never
make
a
peace
with
Stannis,
would
you?
Bend
the
knee?
You
wouldnвЂ™tвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
will
tell
you
true,
Brienne.
I
do
not
know.
My
son
may
be
a
king,
but
I
am
no
queenвЂ¦
only
a
mother
who
would
keep
her
children
safe,
however
she
could.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
not
made
to
be
a
mother.
I
need
to
fight.вЂќ

вЂњThen
fightвЂ¦
but
for
the
living,
not
the
dead.
RenlyвЂ™s
enemies
are
RobbвЂ™s
enemies
as
well.вЂќ

Brienne
stared
at
the
ground
and
shuffled
her
feet.
вЂњI
do
not
know
your
son,
my
lady.вЂќ
She
looked
up.
вЂњI
could
serve
you.
If
you
would
have
me.вЂќ

Catelyn
was
startled.
вЂњWhy
me?вЂќ

The
question
seemed
to
trouble
Brienne.
вЂњYou
helped
me.
In
the
pavilionвЂ¦
when
they
thought
that
I
hadвЂ¦
that
I
hadвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
were
innocent.вЂќ

вЂњEven
so,
you
did
not
have
to
do
that.
You
could
have
let
them
kill
me.
I
was
nothing
to
you.вЂќ

Perhaps
I
did
not
want
to
be
the
only
one
who
knew
the
dark
truth
of
what
had
happened
there,
Catelyn
thought.
вЂњBrienne,
I
have
taken
many
wellborn
ladies
into
my
service
over
the
years,
but
never
one
like
you.
I
am
no
battle
commander.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
but
you
have
courage.
Not
battle
courage
perhaps
butвЂ¦
I
donвЂ™t
knowвЂ¦
a
kind
of
womanвЂ™s
courage.
And
I
think,
when
the
time
comes,
you
will
not
try
and
hold
me
back.
Promise
me
that.
That
you
will
not
hold
me
back
from
Stannis.вЂќ

Catelyn
could
still
hear
Stannis
saying
that
RobbвЂ™s
turn
too
would
come
in
time.
It
was
like
a
cold
breath
on
the
back
of
her
neck.
вЂњWhen
the
time
comes,
I
will
not
hold
you
back.вЂќ

The
tall
girl
knelt
awkwardly,
unsheathed
RenlyвЂ™s
longsword,
and
laid
it
at
her
feet.
вЂњThen
I
am
yours,
my
lady.
Your
liege
man,
orвЂ¦
whatever
you
would
have
me
be.
I
will
shield
your
back
and
keep
your
counsel
and
give
my
life
for
yours,
if
need
be.
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
I
vow
that
you
shall
always
have
a
place
by
my
hearth
and
meat
and
mead
at
my
table,
and
pledge
to
ask
no
service
of
you
that
might
bring
you
into
dishonor.
I
swear
it
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new.
Arise.вЂќ
As
she
clasped
the
other
womanвЂ™s
hands
between
her
own,
Catelyn
could
not
help
but
smile.
How
many
times
did
I
watch
Ned
accept
a
manвЂ™s
oath
of
service?
She
wondered
what
he
would
think
if
he
could
see
her
now.

They
forded
the
Red
Fork
late
the
next
day,
upstream
of
Riverrun
where
the
river
made
a
wide
loop
and
the
waters
grew
muddy
and
shallow.
The
crossing
was
guarded
by
a
mixed
force
of
archers
and
pikemen
wearing
the
eagle
badge
of
the
Mallisters.
When
they
saw
CatelynвЂ™s
banners,
they
emerged
from
behind
their
sharpened
stakes
and
sent
a
man
over
from
the
far
bank
to
lead
her
party
across.
вЂњSlow
and
careful
like,
milady,вЂќ
he
warned
as
he
took
the
bridle
of
her
horse.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
planted
iron
spikes
under
the
water,
yвЂ™see,
and
thereвЂ™s
caltrops
scattered
among
them
rocks
there.
ItвЂ™s
the
same
on
all
the
fords,
by
your
brotherвЂ™s
command.вЂќ

Edmure
thinks
to
fight
here.
The
realization
gave
her
a
queasy
feeling
in
the
bowels,
but
she
held
her
tongue.

Between
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone,
they
joined
a
stream
of
smallfolk
making
for
the
safety
of
Riverrun.
Some
were
driving
animals
before
them,
others
pulling
wayns,
but
they
made
way
as
Catelyn
rode
past,
and
cheered
her
with
cries
of
вЂњTully!вЂќ
or
вЂњStark!вЂќ
Half
a
mile
from
the
castle,
she
passed
through
a
large
encampment
where
the
scarlet
banner
of
the
Blackwoods
waved
above
the
lordвЂ™s
tent.
Lucas
took
his
leave
of
her
there,
to
seek
out
his
father,
Lord
Tytos.
The
rest
rode
on.

Catelyn
spied
a
second
camp
strung
out
along
the
bank
north
of
the
Tumblestone,
familiar
standards
flapping
in
the
windвЂ”Marq
PiperвЂ™s
dancing
maiden,
DarryвЂ™s
plowman,
the
twining
red-and-white
snakes
of
the
Paeges.
They
were
all
her
fatherвЂ™s
bannermen,
lords
of
the
Trident.
Most
had
left
Riverrun
before
she
had,
to
defend
their
own
lands.
If
they
were
here
again,
it
could
only
mean
that
Edmure
had
called
them
back.
Gods
save
us,
itвЂ™s
true,
he
means
to
offer
battle
to
Lord
Tywin.

Something
dark
was
dangling
against
the
walls
of
Riverrun,
Catelyn
saw
from
a
distance.
When
she
rode
close,
she
saw
dead
men
hanging
from
the
battlements,
slumped
at
the
ends
of
long
ropes
with
hempen
nooses
tight
around
their
necks,
their
faces
swollen
and
black.
The
crows
had
been
at
them,
but
their
crimson
cloaks
still
showed
bright
against
the
sandstone
walls.

вЂњThey
have
hanged
some
Lannisters,вЂќ
Hal
Mollen
observed.

вЂњA
pretty
sight,вЂќ
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
said
cheerfully.

вЂњOur
friends
have
begun
without
us,вЂќ
Perwyn
Frey
jested.
The
others
laughed,
all
but
Brienne,
who
gazed
up
at
the
row
of
bodies
unblinking,
and
neither
spoke
nor
smiled.

If
they
have
slain
the
Kingslayer,
then
my
daughters
are
dead
as
well.
Catelyn
spurred
her
horse
to
a
canter.
Hal
Mollen
and
Robin
Flint
raced
past
at
a
gallop,
halooing
to
the
gatehouse.
The
guards
on
the
walls
had
doubtless
spied
her
banners
some
time
ago,
for
the
portcullis
was
up
as
they
approached.

Edmure
rode
out
from
the
castle
to
meet
her,
surrounded
by
three
of
her
fatherвЂ™s
sworn
menвЂ”great-bellied
Ser
Desmond
Grell
the
master-at-arms,
Utherydes
Wayn
the
steward,
and
Ser
Robin
Ryger,
RiverrunвЂ™s
big
bald
captain
of
guards.
They
were
all
three
of
an
age
with
Lord
Hoster,
men
who
had
spent
their
lives
in
her
fatherвЂ™s
service.
Old
men,
Catelyn
realized.

Edmure
wore
a
blue-and-red
cloak
over
a
tunic
embroidered
with
silver
fish.
From
the
look
of
him,
he
had
not
shaved
since
she
rode
south;
his
beard
was
a
fiery
bush.
вЂњCat,
it
is
good
to
have
you
safely
back.
When
we
heard
of
RenlyвЂ™s
death,
we
feared
for
your
life.
And
Lord
Tywin
is
on
the
march
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњSo
I
am
told.
How
fares
our
father?вЂќ

вЂњOne
day
he
seems
stronger,
the
nextвЂ¦вЂќ
He
shook
his
head.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
asked
for
you.
I
did
not
know
what
to
tell
him.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
go
to
him
soon,вЂќ
she
vowed.
вЂњHas
there
been
word
from
StormвЂ™s
End
since
Renly
died?
Or
from
Bitterbridge?вЂќ
No
ravens
came
to
men
on
the
road,
and
Catelyn
was
anxious
to
know
what
had
happened
behind
her.

вЂњNothing
from
Bitterbridge.
From
StormвЂ™s
End,
three
birds
from
the
castellan,
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose,
all
carrying
the
same
plea.
Stannis
has
him
surrounded
by
land
and
sea.
He
offers
his
allegiance
to
whatsoever
king
will
break
the
siege.
He
fears
for
the
boy,
he
says.
What
boy
would
that
be,
do
you
know?вЂќ

вЂњEdric
Storm,вЂќ
Brienne
told
them.
вЂњRobertвЂ™s
bastard
son.вЂќ

Edmure
looked
at
her
curiously.
вЂњStannis
has
sworn
that
the
garrison
might
go
free,
unharmed,
provided
they
yield
the
castle
within
the
fortnight
and
deliver
the
boy
into
his
hands,
but
Ser
Cortnay
will
not
consent.вЂќ

He
risks
all
for
a
baseborn
boy
whose
blood
is
not
even
his
own,
Catelyn
thought.
вЂњDid
you
send
him
an
answer?вЂќ

Edmure
shook
his
head.
вЂњWhy,
when
we
have
neither
help
nor
hope
to
offer?
And
Stannis
is
no
enemy
of
ours.вЂќ

Ser
Robin
Ryger
spoke.
вЂњMy
lady,
can
you
tell
us
the
manner
of
Lord
RenlyвЂ™s
death?
The
tales
weвЂ™ve
heard
have
been
queer.вЂќ

вЂњCat,вЂќ
her
brother
said,
вЂњsome
say
you
killed
Renly.
Others
claim
it
was
some
southron
woman.вЂќ
His
glance
lingered
on
Brienne.

вЂњMy
king
was
murdered,вЂќ
the
girl
said
quietly,
вЂњand
not
by
Lady
Catelyn.
I
swear
it
on
my
sword,
by
the
gods
old
and
new.вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
Brienne
of
Tarth,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Selwyn
the
Evenstar,
who
served
in
RenlyвЂ™s
Rainbow
Guard,вЂќ
Catelyn
told
them.
вЂњBrienne,
I
am
honored
to
acquaint
you
with
my
brother
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
heir
to
Riverrun.
His
steward
Utherydes
Wayn.
Ser
Robin
Ryger
and
Ser
Desmond
Grell.вЂќ

вЂњHonored,вЂќ
said
Ser
Desmond.
The
others
echoed
him.
The
girl
flushed,
embarrassed
even
at
this
commonplace
courtesy.
If
Edmure
thought
her
a
curious
sort
of
lady,
at
least
he
had
the
grace
not
to
say
so.

вЂњBrienne
was
with
Renly
when
he
was
killed,
as
was
I,вЂќ
said
Catelyn,
вЂњbut
we
had
no
part
in
his
death.вЂќ
She
did
not
care
to
speak
of
the
shadow,
here
in
the
open
with
men
all
around,
so
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
bodies.
вЂњWho
are
these
men
youвЂ™ve
hanged?вЂќ

Edmure
glanced
up
uncomfortably.
вЂњThey
came
with
Ser
Cleos
when
he
brought
the
queenвЂ™s
answer
to
our
peace
offer.вЂќ

Catelyn
was
shocked.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
killed
envoys?вЂќ

вЂњFalse
envoys,вЂќ
Edmure
declared.
вЂњThey
pledged
me
their
peace
and
surrendered
their
weapons,
so
I
allowed
them
freedom
of
the
castle,
and
for
three
nights
they
ate
my
meat
and
drank
my
mead
whilst
I
talked
with
Ser
Cleos.
On
the
fourth
night,
they
tried
to
free
the
Kingslayer.вЂќ
He
pointed
up.
вЂњThat
big
brute
killed
two
guards
with
naught
but
those
ham
hands
of
his,
caught
them
by
the
throats
and
smashed
their
skulls
together
while
that
skinny
lad
beside
him
was
opening
LannisterвЂ™s
cell
with
a
bit
of
wire,
gods
curse
him.
The
one
on
the
end
was
some
sort
of
damned
mummer.
He
used
my
own
voice
to
command
that
the
River
Gate
be
opened.
The
guardsmen
swear
to
it,
Enger
and
Delp
and
Long
Lew,
all
three.
If
you
ask
me,
the
man
sounded
nothing
like
me,
and
yet
the
oafs
were
raising
the
portcullis
all
the
same.вЂќ

This
was
the
ImpвЂ™s
work,
Catelyn
suspected;
it
stank
of
the
same
sort
of
cunning
he
had
displayed
at
the
Eyrie.
Once,
she
would
have
named
Tyrion
the
least
dangerous
of
the
Lannisters.
Now
she
was
not
so
certain.
вЂњHow
is
it
you
caught
them?вЂќ

вЂњAh,
as
it
happened,
I
was
not
in
the
castle.
IвЂ™d
crossed
the
Tumblestone
to,
ahвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
were
whoring
or
wenching.
Get
on
with
the
tale.вЂќ

EdmureвЂ™s
cheeks
flamed
as
red
as
his
beard.
вЂњIt
was
the
hour
before
dawn,
and
I
was
only
then
returning.
When
Long
Lew
saw
my
boat
and
recognized
me,
he
finally
thought
to
wonder
who
was
standing
below
barking
commands,
and
raised
a
cry.вЂќ

вЂњTell
me
the
Kingslayer
was
retaken.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
though
not
easily.
Jaime
got
hold
of
a
sword,
slew
Poul
Pernford
and
Ser
DesmondвЂ™s
squire
Myles,
and
wounded
Delp
so
badly
that
Maester
Vyman
fears
heвЂ™ll
soon
die
as
well.
It
was
a
bloody
mess.
At
the
sound
of
steel,
some
of
the
other
red
cloaks
rushed
to
join
him,
barehand
or
no.
I
hanged
those
beside
the
four
who
freed
him,
and
threw
the
rest
in
the
dungeons.
Jaime
too.
WeвЂ™ll
have
no
more
escapes
from
that
one.
HeвЂ™s
down
in
the
dark
this
time,
chained
hand
and
foot
and
bolted
to
the
wall.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Cleos
Frey?вЂќ

вЂњHe
swears
he
knew
naught
of
the
plot.
Who
can
say?
The
man
is
half
Lannister,
half
Frey,
and
all
liar.
I
put
him
in
JaimeвЂ™s
old
tower
cell.вЂќ

вЂњYou
say
he
brought
terms?вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
can
call
them
that.
YouвЂ™ll
like
them
no
more
than
I
did,
I
promise.вЂќ

вЂњCan
we
hope
for
no
help
from
the
south,
Lady
Stark?вЂќ
asked
Utherydes
Wayn,
her
fatherвЂ™s
steward.
вЂњThis
charge
of
incestвЂ¦
Lord
Tywin
does
not
suffer
such
slights
lightly.
He
will
seek
to
wash
the
stain
from
his
daughterвЂ™s
name
with
the
blood
of
her
accuser,
Lord
Stannis
must
see
that.
He
has
no
choice
but
to
make
common
cause
with
us.вЂќ

Stannis
has
made
common
cause
with
a
power
greater
and
darker.
вЂњLet
us
speak
of
these
matters
later.вЂќ
Catelyn
trotted
over
the
drawbridge,
putting
the
grisly
row
of
dead
Lannisters
behind
her.
Her
brother
kept
pace.
As
they
rode
out
into
the
bustle
of
RiverrunвЂ™s
upper
bailey,
a
naked
toddler
ran
in
front
of
the
horses.
Catelyn
jerked
her
reins
hard
to
avoid
him,
glancing
about
in
dismay.
Hundreds
of
smallfolk
had
been
admitted
to
the
castle,
and
allowed
to
erect
crude
shelters
against
the
walls.
Their
children
were
everywhere
underfoot,
and
the
yard
teemed
with
their
cows,
sheep,
and
chickens.
вЂњWho
are
all
these
folk?вЂќ

вЂњMy
people,вЂќ
Edmure
answered.
вЂњThey
were
afraid.вЂќ

Only
my
sweet
brother
would
crowd
all
these
useless
mouths
into
a
castle
that
might
soon
be
under
siege.
Catelyn
knew
that
Edmure
had
a
soft
heart;
sometimes
she
thought
his
head
was
even
softer.
She
loved
him
for
it,
yet
stillвЂ¦

вЂњCan
Robb
be
reached
by
raven?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
in
the
field,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Desmond
replied.
вЂњThe
bird
would
have
no
way
to
find
him.вЂќ

Utherydes
Wayn
coughed.
вЂњBefore
he
left
us,
the
young
king
instructed
us
to
send
you
on
to
the
Twins
upon
your
return,
Lady
Stark.
He
asks
that
you
learn
more
of
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
daughters,
to
help
him
select
his
bride
when
the
time
comes.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
provide
you
with
fresh
mounts
and
provisions,вЂќ
her
brother
promised.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
want
to
refresh
yourself
beforeвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
want
to
stay,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
dismounting.
She
had
no
intention
of
leaving
Riverrun
and
her
dying
father
to
pick
RobbвЂ™s
wife
for
him.
Robb
wants
me
safe,
I
cannot
fault
him
for
that,
but
his
pretext
is
growing
threadbare.
вЂњBoy,вЂќ
she
called,
and
an
urchin
from
the
stables
ran
out
to
take
the
reins
of
her
horse.

Edmure
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
He
was
a
head
taller
than
she
was,
but
he
would
always
be
her
little
brother.
вЂњCat,вЂќ
he
said
unhappily,
вЂњLord
Tywin
is
comingвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
making
for
the
west,
to
defend
his
own
lands.
If
we
close
our
gates
and
shelter
behind
the
walls,
we
can
watch
him
pass
with
safety.вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
Tully
land,вЂќ
Edmure
declared.
вЂњIf
Tywin
Lannister
thinks
to
cross
it
unbloodied,
I
mean
to
teach
him
a
hard
lesson.вЂќ

The
same
lesson
you
taught
his
son?
Her
brother
could
be
stubborn
as
river
rock
when
his
pride
was
touched,
but
neither
of
them
was
likely
to
forget
how
Ser
Jaime
had
cut
EdmureвЂ™s
host
to
bloody
pieces
the
last
time
he
had
offered
battle.
вЂњWe
have
nothing
to
gain
and
everything
to
lose
by
meeting
Lord
Tywin
in
the
field,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
tactfully.

вЂњThe
yard
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
my
battle
plans.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will.
Where
shall
we
go?вЂќ

Her
brotherвЂ™s
face
darkened.
For
a
moment
she
thought
he
was
about
to
lose
his
temper
with
her,
but
finally
he
snapped,
вЂњThe
godswood.
If
you
will
insist.вЂќ

She
followed
him
along
a
gallery
to
the
godswood
gate.
EdmureвЂ™s
anger
had
always
been
a
sulky,
sullen
thing.
Catelyn
was
sorry
she
had
wounded
him,
but
the
matter
was
too
important
for
her
to
concern
herself
with
his
pride.
When
they
were
alone
beneath
the
trees,
Edmure
turned
to
face
her.

вЂњYou
do
not
have
the
strength
to
meet
the
Lannisters
in
the
field,вЂќ
she
said
bluntly.

вЂњWhen
all
my
strength
is
marshaled,
I
should
have
eight
thousand
foot
and
three
thousand
horse,вЂќ
Edmure
said.

вЂњWhich
means
Lord
Tywin
will
have
near
twice
your
numbers.вЂќ

вЂњRobbвЂ™s
won
his
battles
against
worse
odds,вЂќ
Edmure
replied,
вЂњand
I
have
a
plan.
YouвЂ™ve
forgotten
Roose
Bolton.
Lord
Tywin
defeated
him
on
the
Green
Fork,
but
failed
to
pursue.
When
Lord
Tywin
went
to
Harrenhal,
Bolton
took
the
ruby
ford
and
the
crossroads.
He
has
ten
thousand
men.
IвЂ™ve
sent
word
to
Helman
Tallhart
to
join
him
with
the
garrison
Robb
left
at
the
TwinsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњEdmure,
Robb
left
those
men
to
hold
the
Twins
and
make
certain
Lord
Walder
keeps
faith
with
us.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has,вЂќ
Edmure
said
stubbornly.
вЂњThe
Freys
fought
bravely
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
old
Ser
Stevron
died
at
Oxcross,
we
hear.
Ser
Ryman
and
Black
Walder
and
the
rest
are
with
Robb
in
the
west,
Martyn
has
been
of
great
service
scouting,
and
Ser
Perwyn
helped
see
you
safe
to
Renly.
Gods
be
good,
how
much
more
can
we
ask
of
them?
RobbвЂ™s
betrothed
to
one
of
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
daughters,
and
Roose
Bolton
wed
another,
I
hear.
And
havenвЂ™t
you
taken
two
of
his
grandsons
to
be
fostered
at
Winterfell?вЂќ

вЂњA
ward
can
easily
become
a
hostage,
if
need
be.вЂќ
She
had
not
known
that
Ser
Stevron
was
dead,
nor
of
BoltonвЂ™s
marriage.

вЂњIf
weвЂ™re
two
hostages
to
the
good,
all
the
more
reason
Lord
Walder
dare
not
play
us
false.
Bolton
needs
FreyвЂ™s
men,
and
Ser
HelmanвЂ™s
as
well.
IвЂ™ve
commanded
him
to
retake
Harrenhal.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
like
to
be
a
bloody
business.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
but
once
the
castle
falls,
Lord
Tywin
will
have
no
safe
retreat.
My
own
levies
will
defend
the
fords
of
Red
Fork
against
his
crossing.
If
he
attacks
across
the
river,
heвЂ™ll
end
as
Rhaegar
did
when
he
tried
to
cross
the
Trident.
If
he
holds
back,
heвЂ™ll
be
caught
between
Riverrun
and
Harrenhal,
and
when
Robb
returns
from
the
west
we
can
finish
him
for
good
and
all.вЂќ

Her
brotherвЂ™s
voice
was
full
of
brusque
confidence,
but
Catelyn
found
herself
wishing
that
Robb
had
not
taken
her
uncle
Brynden
west
with
him.
The
Blackfish
was
the
veteran
of
half
a
hundred
battles;
Edmure
was
the
veteran
of
one,
and
that
one
lost.

вЂњThe
planвЂ™s
a
good
one,вЂќ
he
concluded.
вЂњLord
Tytos
says
so,
and
Lord
Jonos
as
well.
When
did
Blackwood
and
Bracken
agree
about
anything
that
was
not
certain,
I
ask
you?вЂќ

вЂњBe
that
as
it
may.вЂќ
She
was
suddenly
weary.
Perhaps
she
was
wrong
to
oppose
him.
Perhaps
it
was
a
splendid
plan,
and
her
misgivings
only
a
womanвЂ™s
fears.
She
wished
Ned
were
here,
or
her
uncle
Brynden,
orвЂ¦вЂњHave
you
asked
Father
about
this?вЂќ

вЂњFather
is
in
no
state
to
weigh
strategies.
Two
days
ago
he
was
making
plans
for
your
marriage
to
Brandon
Stark!
Go
see
him
yourself
if
you
do
not
believe
me.
This
plan
will
work,
Cat,
youвЂ™ll
see.вЂќ

вЂњI
hope
so,
Edmure.
I
truly
do.вЂќ
She
kissed
him
on
the
cheek,
to
let
him
know
she
meant
it,
and
went
to
find
her
father.

Lord
Hoster
Tully
was
much
as
she
had
left
himвЂ”abed,
haggard,
flesh
pale
and
clammy.
The
room
smelled
of
sickness,
a
cloying
odor
made
up
in
equal
parts
of
stale
sweat
and
medicine.
When
she
pulled
back
the
drapes,
her
father
gave
a
low
moan,
and
his
eyes
fluttered
open.
He
stared
at
her
as
if
he
could
not
comprehend
who
she
was
or
what
she
wanted.

вЂњFather.вЂќ
She
kissed
him.
вЂњI
am
returned.вЂќ

He
seemed
to
know
her
then.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
come,вЂќ
he
whispered
faintly,
lips
barely
moving.

вЂњYes,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњRobb
sent
me
south,
but
I
hurried
back.вЂќ

вЂњSouthвЂ¦
whereвЂ¦
is
the
Eyrie
south,
sweetling?
I
donвЂ™t
recallвЂ¦
oh,
dear
heart,
I
was
afraidвЂ¦
have
you
forgiven
me,
child?вЂќ
Tears
ran
down
his
cheeks.

вЂњYouвЂ™ve
done
nothing
that
needs
forgiveness,
Father.вЂќ
She
stroked
his
limp
white
hair
and
felt
his
brow.
The
fever
still
burned
him
from
within,
despite
all
the
maesterвЂ™s
potions.

вЂњIt
was
best,вЂќ
her
father
whispered.
вЂњJonвЂ™s
a
good
man,
goodвЂ¦
strong,
kindвЂ¦
take
care
of
youвЂ¦
he
willвЂ¦
and
well
born,
listen
to
me,
you
must,
IвЂ™m
your
fatherвЂ¦
your
fatherвЂ¦
youвЂ™ll
wed
when
Cat
does,
yes
you
willвЂ¦вЂќ

He
thinks
IвЂ™m
Lysa,
Catelyn
realized.
Gods
be
good,
he
talks
as
if
we
were
not
married
yet.

Her
fatherвЂ™s
hands
clutched
at
hers,
fluttering
like
two
frightened
white
birds.
вЂњThat
striplingвЂ¦
wretched
boyвЂ¦
not
speak
that
name
to
me,
your
dutyвЂ¦
your
mother,
she
wouldвЂ¦вЂќ
Lord
Hoster
cried
as
a
spasm
of
pain
washed
over
him.
вЂњOh,
gods
forgive
me,
forgive
me,
forgive
me.
My
medicineвЂ¦вЂќ

And
then
Maester
Vyman
was
there,
holding
a
cup
to
his
lips.
Lord
Hoster
sucked
at
the
thick
white
potion
as
eager
as
a
babe
at
the
breast,
and
Catelyn
could
see
peace
settle
over
him
once
more.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
sleep
now,
my
lady,вЂќ
the
maester
said
when
the
cup
was
empty.
The
milk
of
the
poppy
had
left
a
thick
white
film
around
her
fatherвЂ™s
mouth.
Maester
Vyman
wiped
it
away
with
a
sleeve.

Catelyn
could
watch
no
more.
Hoster
Tully
had
been
a
strong
man,
and
proud.
It
hurt
her
to
see
him
reduced
to
this.
She
went
out
to
the
terrace.
The
yard
below
was
crowded
with
refugees
and
chaotic
with
their
noises,
but
beyond
the
walls
the
rivers
flowed
clean
and
pure
and
endless.
Those
are
his
rivers,
and
soon
he
will
return
to
them
for
his
last
voyage.

Maester
Vyman
had
followed
her
out.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
he
said
softly,
вЂњI
cannot
keep
the
end
at
bay
much
longer.
We
ought
send
a
rider
after
his
brother.
Ser
Brynden
would
wish
to
be
here.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
her
voice
thick
with
her
grief.

вЂњAnd
the
Lady
Lysa
as
well,
perhaps?вЂќ

вЂњLysa
will
not
come.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
wrote
her
yourself,
perhapsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
will
put
some
words
to
paper,
if
that
please
you.вЂќ
She
wondered
who
LysaвЂ™s
вЂњwretched
striplingвЂќ
had
been.
Some
young
squire
or
hedge
knight,
like
as
notвЂ¦
though
by
the
vehemence
with
which
Lord
Hoster
had
opposed
him,
he
might
have
been
a
tradesmanвЂ™s
son
or
baseborn
apprentice,
even
a
singer.
Lysa
had
always
been
too
fond
of
singers.
I
must
not
blame
her.
Jon
Arryn
was
twenty
years
older
than
our
father,
however
noble.

The
tower
her
brother
had
set
aside
for
her
use
was
the
very
same
that
she
and
Lysa
had
shared
as
maids.
It
would
feel
good
to
sleep
on
a
featherbed
again,
with
a
warm
fire
in
the
hearth;
when
she
was
rested
the
world
would
seem
less
bleak.

But
outside
her
chambers
she
found
Utherydes
Wayn
waiting
with
two
women
clad
in
grey,
their
faces
cowled
save
for
their
eyes.
Catelyn
knew
at
once
why
they
were
here.
вЂњNed?вЂќ

The
sisters
lowered
their
gaze.
Utherydes
said,
вЂњSer
Cleos
brought
him
from
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњTake
me
to
him,вЂќ
she
commanded.

They
had
laid
him
out
on
a
trestle
table
and
covered
him
with
a
banner,
the
white
banner
of
House
Stark
with
its
grey
direwolf
sigil.
вЂњI
would
look
on
him,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.

вЂњOnly
the
bones
remain,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
look
on
him,вЂќ
she
repeated.

One
of
the
silent
sisters
turned
down
the
banner.

Bones,
Catelyn
thought.
This
is
not
Ned,
this
is
not
the
man
I
loved,
the
father
of
my
children.
His
hands
were
clasped
together
over
his
chest,
skeletal
fingers
curled
about
the
hilt
of
some
longsword,
but
they
were
not
NedвЂ™s
hands,
so
strong
and
full
of
life.
They
had
dressed
the
bones
in
NedвЂ™s
surcoat,
the
fine
white
velvet
with
the
direwolf
badge
over
the
heart,
but
nothing
remained
of
the
warm
flesh
that
had
pillowed
her
head
so
many
nights,
the
arms
that
had
held
her.
The
head
had
been
rejoined
to
the
body
with
fine
silver
wire,
but
one
skull
looks
much
like
another,
and
in
those
empty
hollows
she
found
no
trace
of
her
lordвЂ™s
dark
grey
eyes,
eyes
that
could
be
soft
as
a
fog
or
hard
as
stone.
They
gave
his
eyes
to
crows,
she
remembered.

Catelyn
turned
away.
вЂњThat
is
not
his
sword.вЂќ

вЂњIce
was
not
returned
to
us,
my
lady,вЂќ
Utherydes
said.
вЂњOnly
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
bones.вЂќ

вЂњI
suppose
I
must
thank
the
queen
for
even
that
much.вЂќ

вЂњThank
the
Imp,
my
lady.
It
was
his
doing.вЂќ

One
day
I
will
thank
them
all.
вЂњI
am
grateful
for
your
service,
sisters,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
вЂњbut
I
must
lay
another
task
upon
you.
Lord
Eddard
was
a
Stark,
and
his
bones
must
be
laid
to
rest
beneath
Winterfell.вЂќ
They
will
make
a
statue
of
him,
a
stone
likeness
that
will
sit
in
the
dark
with
a
direwolf
at
his
feet
and
a
sword
across
his
knees.
вЂњMake
certain
the
sisters
have
fresh
horses,
and
aught
else
they
need
for
the
journey,вЂќ
she
told
Utherydes
Wayn.
вЂњHal
Mollen
will
escort
them
back
to
Winterfell,
it
is
his
place
as
captain
of
guards.вЂќ
She
gazed
down
at
the
bones
that
were
all
that
remained
of
her
lord
and
love.
вЂњNow
leave
me,
all
of
you.
I
would
be
alone
with
Ned
tonight.вЂќ

The
women
in
grey
bowed
their
heads.
The
silent
sisters
do
not
speak
to
the
living,
Catelyn
remembered
dully,
but
some
say
they
can
talk
to
the
dead.
And
how
she
envied
thatвЂ¦





DAENERYS

The
drapes
kept
out
the
dust
and
heat
of
the
streets,
but
they
could
not
keep
out
disappointment.
Dany
climbed
inside
wearily,
glad
for
the
refuge
from
the
sea
of
Qartheen
eyes.
вЂњMake
way,вЂќ
Jhogo
shouted
at
the
crowd
from
horseback,
snapping
his
whip,
вЂњmake
way,
make
way
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons.вЂќ

Reclining
on
cool
satin
cushions,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
poured
ruby-red
wine
into
matched
goblets
of
jade
and
gold,
his
hands
sure
and
steady
despite
the
sway
of
the
palanquin.
вЂњI
see
a
deep
sadness
written
upon
your
face,
my
light
of
love.вЂќ
He
offered
her
a
goblet.
вЂњCould
it
be
the
sadness
of
a
lost
dream?вЂќ

вЂњA
dream
delayed,
no
more.вЂќ
DanyвЂ™s
tight
silver
collar
was
chafing
against
her
throat.
She
unfastened
it
and
flung
it
aside.
The
collar
was
set
with
an
enchanted
amethyst
that
Xaro
swore
would
ward
her
against
all
poisons.
The
Pureborn
were
notorious
for
offering
poisoned
wine
to
those
they
thought
dangerous,
but
they
had
not
given
Dany
so
much
as
a
cup
of
water.
They
never
saw
me
for
a
queen,
she
thought
bitterly.
I
was
only
an
afternoonвЂ™s
amusement,
a
horse
girl
with
a
curious
pet.

Rhaegal
hissed
and
dug
sharp
black
claws
into
her
bare
shoulder
as
Dany
stretched
out
a
hand
for
the
wine.
Wincing,
she
shifted
him
to
her
other
shoulder,
where
he
could
claw
her
gown
instead
of
her
skin.
She
was
garbed
after
the
Qartheen
fashion.
Xaro
had
warned
her
that
the
Enthroned
would
never
listen
to
a
Dothraki,
so
she
had
taken
care
to
go
before
them
in
flowing
green
samite
with
one
breast
bared,
silvered
sandals
on
her
feet,
with
a
belt
of
black-and-white
pearls
about
her
waist.
For
all
the
help
they
offered,
I
could
have
gone
naked.
Perhaps
I
should
have.
She
drank
deep.

Descendants
of
the
ancient
kings
and
queens
of
Qarth,
the
Pureborn
commanded
the
Civic
Guard
and
the
fleet
of
ornate
galleys
that
ruled
the
straits
between
the
seas.
Daenerys
Targaryen
had
wanted
that
fleet,
or
part
of
it,
and
some
of
their
soldiers
as
well.
She
made
the
traditional
sacrifice
in
the
Temple
of
Memory,
offered
the
traditional
bribe
to
the
Keeper
of
the
Long
List,
sent
the
traditional
persimmon
to
the
Opener
of
the
Door,
and
finally
received
the
traditional
blue
silk
slippers
summoning
her
to
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones.

The
Pureborn
heard
her
pleas
from
the
great
wooden
seats
of
their
ancestors,
rising
in
curved
tiers
from
a
marble
floor
to
a
high-domed
ceiling
painted
with
scenes
of
QarthвЂ™s
vanished
glory.
The
chairs
were
immense,
fantastically
carved,
bright
with
goldwork
and
studded
with
amber,
onyx,
lapis,
and
jade,
each
one
different
from
all
the
others,
and
each
striving
to
be
the
most
fabulous.
Yet
the
men
who
sat
in
them
seemed
so
listless
and
world-weary
that
they
might
have
been
asleep.
They
listened,
but
they
did
not
hear,
or
care,
she
thought.
They
are
Milk
Men
indeed.
They
never
meant
to
help
me.
They
came
because
they
were
curious.
They
came
because
they
were
bored,
and
the
dragon
on
my
shoulder
interested
them
more
than
I
did.

вЂњTell
me
the
words
of
the
Pureborn,вЂќ
prompted
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.
вЂњTell
me
what
they
said
to
sadden
the
queen
of
my
heart.вЂќ

вЂњThey
said
no.вЂќ
The
wine
tasted
of
pomegranates
and
hot
summer
days.
вЂњThey
said
it
with
great
courtesy,
to
be
sure,
but
under
all
the
lovely
words,
it
was
still
no.вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
flatter
them?вЂќ

вЂњShamelessly.вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
weep?вЂќ

вЂњThe
blood
of
the
dragon
does
not
weep,вЂќ
she
said
testily.

Xaro
sighed.
вЂњYou
ought
to
have
wept.вЂќ
The
Qartheen
wept
often
and
easily;
it
was
considered
a
mark
of
the
civilized
man.
вЂњThe
men
we
bought,
what
did
they
say?вЂќ

вЂњMathos
said
nothing.
Wendello
praised
the
way
I
spoke.
The
Exquisite
refused
me
with
the
rest,
but
he
wept
afterward.вЂќ

вЂњAlas,
that
Qartheen
should
be
so
faithless.вЂќ
Xaro
was
not
himself
of
the
Pureborn,
but
he
had
told
her
whom
to
bribe
and
how
much
to
offer.
вЂњWeep,
weep,
for
the
treachery
of
men.вЂќ

Dany
would
sooner
have
wept
for
her
gold.
The
bribes
sheвЂ™d
tendered
to
Mathos
Mallarawan,
Wendello
Qar
Deeth,
and
Egon
Emeros
the
Exquisite
might
have
bought
her
a
ship,
or
hired
a
score
of
sellswords.
вЂњSuppose
I
sent
Ser
Jorah
to
demand
the
return
of
my
gifts?вЂќ
she
asked.

вЂњSuppose
a
Sorrowful
Man
came
to
my
palace
one
night
and
killed
you
as
you
slept,вЂќ
said
Xaro.
The
Sorrowful
Men
were
an
ancient
sacred
guild
of
assassins,
so
named
because
they
always
whispered,
вЂњI
am
so
sorry,вЂќ
to
their
victims
before
they
killed
them.
The
Qartheen
were
nothing
if
not
polite.
вЂњIt
is
wisely
said
that
it
is
easier
to
milk
the
Stone
Cow
of
Faros
than
to
wring
gold
from
the
Pureborn.вЂќ

Dany
did
not
know
where
Faros
was,
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
Qarth
was
full
of
stone
cows.
The
merchant
princes,
grown
vastly
rich
off
the
trade
between
the
seas,
were
divided
into
three
jealous
factions:
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers,
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood,
and
the
Thirteen,
to
which
Xaro
belonged.
Each
vied
with
the
others
for
dominance,
and
all
three
contended
endlessly
with
the
Pureborn.
And
brooding
over
all
were
the
warlocks,
with
their
blue
lips
and
dread
powers,
seldom
seen
but
much
feared.

She
would
have
been
lost
without
Xaro.
The
gold
that
she
had
squandered
to
open
the
doors
of
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones
was
largely
a
product
of
the
merchantвЂ™s
generosity
and
quick
wits.
As
the
rumor
of
living
dragons
had
spread
through
the
east,
ever
more
seekers
had
come
to
learn
if
the
tale
was
trueвЂ”and
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
saw
to
it
that
the
great
and
the
humble
alike
offered
some
token
to
the
Mother
of
Dragons.

The
trickle
he
started
soon
swelled
to
a
flood.
Trader
captains
brought
lace
from
Myr,
chests
of
saffron
from
Yi
Ti,
amber
and
dragonglass
out
of
Asshai.
Merchants
offered
bags
of
coin,
silversmiths
rings
and
chains.
Pipers
piped
for
her,
tumblers
tumbled,
and
jugglers
juggled,
while
dyers
draped
her
in
colors
she
had
never
known
existed.
A
pair
of
Jogos
Nhai
presented
her
with
one
of
their
striped
zorses,
black
and
white
and
fierce.
A
widow
brought
the
dried
corpse
of
her
husband,
covered
with
a
crust
of
silvered
leaves;
such
remnants
were
believed
to
have
great
power,
especially
if
the
deceased
had
been
a
sorcerer,
as
this
one
had.
And
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood
pressed
on
her
a
crown
wrought
in
the
shape
of
a
three-headed
dragon;
the
coils
were
yellow
gold,
the
wings
silver,
the
heads
carved
from
jade,
ivory,
and
onyx.

The
crown
was
the
only
offering
sheвЂ™d
kept.
The
rest
she
sold,
to
gather
the
wealth
she
had
wasted
on
the
Pureborn.
Xaro
would
have
sold
the
crown
tooвЂ”the
Thirteen
would
see
that
she
had
a
much
finer
one,
he
sworeвЂ”but
Dany
forbade
it.
вЂњViserys
sold
my
motherвЂ™s
crown,
and
men
called
him
a
beggar.
I
shall
keep
this
one,
so
men
will
call
me
a
queen.вЂќ
And
so
she
did,
though
the
weight
of
it
made
her
neck
ache.

Yet
even
crowned,
I
am
a
beggar
still,
Dany
thought.
I
have
become
the
most
splendid
beggar
in
the
world,
but
a
beggar
all
the
same.
She
hated
it,
as
her
brother
must
have.
All
those
years
of
running
from
city
to
city
one
step
ahead
of
the
UsurperвЂ™s
knives,
pleading
for
help
from
archons
and
princes
and
magisters,
buying
our
food
with
flattery.
He
must
have
known
how
they
mocked
him.
Small
wonder
he
turned
so
angry
and
bitter.
In
the
end
it
had
driven
him
mad.
It
will
do
the
same
to
me
if
I
let
it.
Part
of
her
would
have
liked
nothing
more
than
to
lead
her
people
back
to
Vaes
Tolorro,
and
make
the
dead
city
bloom.
No,
that
is
defeat.
I
have
something
Viserys
never
had.
I
have
the
dragons.
The
dragons
are
all
the
difference.

She
stroked
Rhaegal.
The
green
dragon
closed
his
teeth
around
the
meat
of
her
hand
and
nipped
hard.
Outside,
the
great
city
murmured
and
thrummed
and
seethed,
all
its
myriad
voices
blending
into
one
low
sound
like
the
surge
of
the
sea.
вЂњMake
way,
you
Milk
Men,
make
way
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons,вЂќ
Jhogo
cried,
and
the
Qartheen
moved
aside,
though
perhaps
the
oxen
had
more
to
do
with
that
than
his
voice.
Through
the
swaying
draperies,
Dany
caught
glimpses
of
him
astride
his
grey
stallion.
From
time
to
time
he
gave
one
of
the
oxen
a
flick
with
the
silver-handled
whip
she
had
given
him.
Aggo
guarded
on
her
other
side,
while
Rakharo
rode
behind
the
procession,
watching
the
faces
in
the
crowd
for
any
sign
of
danger.
Ser
Jorah
she
had
left
behind
today,
to
guard
her
other
dragons;
the
exile
knight
had
been
opposed
to
this
folly
from
the
start.
He
distrusts
everyone,
she
reflected,
and
perhaps
for
good
reason.

As
Dany
lifted
her
goblet
to
drink,
Rhaegal
sniffed
at
the
wine
and
drew
his
head
back,
hissing.
вЂњYour
dragon
has
a
good
nose.вЂќ
Xaro
wiped
his
lips.
вЂњThe
wine
is
ordinary.
It
is
said
that
across
the
Jade
Sea
they
make
a
golden
vintage
so
fine
that
one
sip
makes
all
other
wines
taste
like
vinegar.
Let
us
take
my
pleasure
barge
and
go
in
search
of
it,
you
and
I.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Arbor
makes
the
best
wine
in
the
world,вЂќ
Dany
declared.
Lord
Redwyne
had
fought
for
her
father
against
the
Usurper,
she
remembered,
one
of
the
few
to
remain
true
to
the
last.
Will
he
fight
for
me
as
well?
There
was
no
way
to
be
certain
after
so
many
years.
вЂњCome
with
me
to
the
Arbor,
Xaro,
and
youвЂ™ll
have
the
finest
vintages
you
ever
tasted.
But
weвЂ™ll
need
to
go
in
a
warship,
not
a
pleasure
barge.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
no
warships.
War
is
bad
for
trade.
Many
times
I
have
told
you,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
is
a
man
of
peace.вЂќ

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
is
a
man
of
gold,
she
thought,
and
gold
will
buy
me
all
the
ships
and
swords
I
need.
вЂњI
have
not
asked
you
to
take
up
a
sword,
only
to
lend
me
your
ships.вЂќ

He
smiled
modestly.
вЂњOf
trading
ships
I
have
a
few,
that
is
so.
Who
can
say
how
many?
One
may
be
sinking
even
now,
in
some
stormy
corner
of
the
Summer
Sea.
On
the
morrow,
another
will
fall
afoul
of
corsairs.
The
next
day,
one
of
my
captains
may
look
at
the
wealth
in
his
hold
and
think,
All
this
should
belong
to
me.
Such
are
the
perils
of
trade.
Why,
the
longer
we
talk,
the
fewer
ships
I
am
likely
to
have.
I
grow
poorer
by
the
instant.вЂќ

вЂњGive
me
ships,
and
I
will
make
you
rich
again.вЂќ

вЂњMarry
me,
bright
light,
and
sail
the
ship
of
my
heart.
I
cannot
sleep
at
night
for
thinking
of
your
beauty.вЂќ

Dany
smiled.
XaroвЂ™s
flowery
protestations
of
passion
amused
her,
but
his
manner
was
at
odds
with
his
words.
While
Ser
Jorah
had
scarcely
been
able
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
bare
breast
when
heвЂ™d
helped
her
into
the
palanquin,
Xaro
hardly
deigned
to
notice
it,
even
in
these
close
confines.
And
she
had
seen
the
beautiful
boys
who
surrounded
the
merchant
prince,
flitting
through
his
palace
halls
in
wisps
of
silk.
вЂњYou
speak
sweetly,
Xaro,
but
under
your
words
I
hear
another
no.вЂќ

вЂњThis
Iron
Throne
you
speak
of
sounds
monstrous
cold
and
hard.
I
cannot
bear
the
thought
of
jagged
barbs
cutting
your
sweet
skin.вЂќ
The
jewels
in
XaroвЂ™s
nose
gave
him
the
aspect
of
some
strange
glittery
bird.
His
long,
elegant
fingers
waved
dismissal.
вЂњLet
this
be
your
kingdom,
most
exquisite
of
queens,
and
let
me
be
your
king.
I
will
give
you
a
throne
of
gold,
if
you
like.
When
Qarth
begins
to
pall,
we
can
journey
round
Yi
Ti
and
search
for
the
dreaming
city
of
the
poets,
to
sip
the
wine
of
wisdom
from
a
dead
manвЂ™s
skull.вЂќ

вЂњI
mean
to
sail
to
Westeros,
and
drink
the
wine
of
vengeance
from
the
skull
of
the
Usurper.вЂќ
She
scratched
Rhaegal
under
one
eye,
and
his
jade-green
wings
unfolded
for
a
moment,
stirring
the
still
air
in
the
palanquin.

A
single
perfect
tear
ran
down
the
cheek
of
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos.
вЂњWill
nothing
turn
you
from
this
madness?вЂќ

вЂњNothing,вЂќ
she
said,
wishing
she
was
as
certain
as
she
sounded.
вЂњIf
each
of
the
Thirteen
would
lend
me
ten
shipsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
have
one
hundred
thirty
ships,
and
no
crew
to
sail
them.
The
justice
of
your
cause
means
naught
to
the
common
men
of
Qarth.
Why
should
my
sailors
care
who
sits
upon
the
throne
of
some
kingdom
at
the
edge
of
the
world?вЂќ

вЂњI
will
pay
them
to
care.вЂќ

вЂњWith
what
coin,
sweet
star
of
my
heaven?вЂќ

вЂњWith
the
gold
the
seekers
bring.вЂќ

вЂњThat
you
may
do,вЂќ
Xaro
acknowledged,
вЂњbut
so
much
caring
will
cost
dear.
You
will
need
to
pay
them
far
more
than
I
do,
and
all
of
Qarth
laughs
at
my
ruinous
generosity.вЂќ

вЂњIf
the
Thirteen
will
not
aid
me,
perhaps
I
should
ask
the
Guild
of
Spicers
or
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood?вЂќ

Xaro
gave
a
languid
shrug.
вЂњThey
will
give
you
nothing
but
flattery
and
lies.
The
Spicers
are
dissemblers
and
braggarts
and
the
Brotherhood
is
full
of
pirates.вЂќ

вЂњThen
I
must
heed
Pyat
Pree,
and
go
to
the
warlocks.вЂќ

The
merchant
prince
sat
up
sharply.
вЂњPyat
Pree
has
blue
lips,
and
it
is
truly
said
that
blue
lips
speak
only
lies.
Heed
the
wisdom
of
one
who
loves
you.
Warlocks
are
bitter
creatures
who
eat
dust
and
drink
of
shadows.
They
will
give
you
naught.
They
have
naught
to
give.вЂќ

вЂњI
would
not
need
to
seek
sorcerous
help
if
my
friend
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
give
me
what
I
ask.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
given
you
my
home
and
heart,
do
they
mean
nothing
to
you?
I
have
given
you
perfume
and
pomegranates,
tumbling
monkeys
and
spitting
snakes,
scrolls
from
lost
Valyria,
an
idolвЂ™s
head
and
a
serpentвЂ™s
foot.
I
have
given
you
this
palanquin
of
ebony
and
gold,
and
a
matched
set
of
bullocks
to
bear
it,
one
white
as
ivory
and
one
black
as
jet,
with
horns
inlaid
with
jewels.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Dany
said.
вЂњBut
it
was
ships
and
soldiers
I
wanted.вЂќ

вЂњDid
I
not
give
you
an
army,
sweetest
of
women?
A
thousand
knights,
each
in
shining
armor.вЂќ

The
armor
had
been
made
of
silver
and
gold,
the
knights
of
jade
and
beryl
and
onyx
and
tourmaline,
of
amber
and
opal
and
amethyst,
each
as
tall
as
her
little
finger.
вЂњA
thousand
lovely
knights,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњbut
not
the
sort
my
enemies
need
fear.
And
my
bullocks
cannot
carry
me
across
the
water,
IвЂ”why
are
we
stopping?вЂќ
The
oxen
had
slowed
notably.

вЂњKhaleesi,вЂќ
Aggo
called
through
the
drapes
as
the
palanquin
jerked
to
a
sudden
halt.
Dany
rolled
onto
an
elbow
to
lean
out.
They
were
on
the
fringes
of
the
bazaar,
the
way
ahead
blocked
by
a
solid
wall
of
people.
вЂњWhat
are
they
looking
at?вЂќ

Jhogo
rode
back
to
her.
вЂњA
firemage,
Khaleesi.вЂќ

вЂњI
want
to
sec.вЂќ

вЂњThen
you
must.вЂќ
The
Dothraki
offered
a
hand
down.
When
she
took
it,
he
pulled
her
up
onto
his
horse
and
sat
her
in
front
of
him,
where
she
could
see
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd.
The
firemage
had
conjured
a
ladder
in
the
air,
a
crackling
orange
ladder
of
swirling
flame
that
rose
unsupported
from
the
floor
of
the
bazaar,
reaching
toward
the
high
latticed
roof.

Most
of
the
spectators,
she
noticed,
were
not
of
the
city:
she
saw
sailors
off
trading
ships,
merchants
come
by
caravan,
dusty
men
out
of
the
red
waste,
wandering
soldiers,
craftsmen,
slavers.
Jhogo,
slid
one
hand
about
her
waist
and
leaned
close.
вЂњThe
Milk
Men
shun
him.
Khaleesi,
do
you
see
the
girl
in
the
felt
hat?
There,
behind
the
fat
priest.
She
is
aвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”cutpurse,вЂќ
finished
Dany.
She
was
no
pampered
lady,
blind
to
such
things.
She
had
seen
cutpurses
aplenty
in
the
streets
of
the
Free
Cities,
during
the
years
sheвЂ™d
spent
with
her
brother,
running
from
the
UsurperвЂ™s
hired
knives.

The
mage
was
gesturing,
urging
the
flames
higher
and
higher
with
broad
sweeps
of
his
arms.
As
the
watchers
craned
their
necks
upward,
the
cutpurses
squirmed
through
the
press,
small
blades
hidden
in
their
palms.
They
relieved
the
prosperous
of
their
coin
with
one
hand
while
pointing
upward
with
the
other.

When
the
fiery
ladder
stood
forty
feet
high,
the
mage
leapt
forward
and
began
to
climb
it,
scrambling
up
hand
over
hand
as
quick
as
a
monkey.
Each
rung
he
touched
dissolved
behind
him,
leaving
no
more
than
a
wisp
of
silver
smoke.
When
he
reached
the
top,
the
ladder
was
gone
and
so
was
he.

вЂњA
fine
trick,вЂќ
announced
Jhogo
with
admiration.

вЂњNo
trick,вЂќ
a
woman
said
in
the
Common
Tongue.

Dany
had
not
noticed
Quaithe
in
the
crowd,
yet
there
she
stood,
eyes
wet
and
shiny
behind
the
implacable
red
lacquer
mask.
вЂњWhat
mean
you,
my
lady?вЂќ

вЂњHalf
a
year
gone,
that
man
could
scarcely
wake
fire
from
dragonglass.
He
had
some
small
skill
with
powders
and
wildfire,
sufficient
to
entrance
a
crowd
while
his
cutpurses
did
their
work.
He
could
walk
across
hot
coals
and
make
burning
roses
bloom
in
the
air,
but
he
could
no
more
aspire
to
climb
the
fiery
ladder
than
a
common
fisherman
could
hope
to
catch
a
kraken
in
his
nets.вЂќ

Dany
looked
uneasily
at
where
the
ladder
had
stood.
Even
the
smoke
was
gone
now,
and
the
crowd
was
breaking
up,
each
man
going
about
his
business.
In
a
moment
more
than
a
few
would
find
their
purses
flat
and
empty.
вЂњAnd
now?вЂќ

вЂњAnd
now
his
powers
grow,
Khaleesi.
And
you
are
the
cause
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњMe?вЂќ
She
laughed.
вЂњHow
could
that
be?вЂќ

The
woman
stepped
closer
and
lay
two
fingers
on
DanyвЂ™s
wrist.
вЂњYou
are
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
are
you
not?вЂќ

вЂњShe
is,
and
no
spawn
of
shadows
may
touch
her.вЂќ
Jhogo
brushed
QuaitheвЂ™s
fingers
away
with
the
handle
of
his
whip.

The
woman
took
a
step
backward.
вЂњYou
must
leave
this
city
soon,
Daenerys
Targaryen,
or
you
will
never
be
permitted
to
leave
it
at
all.вЂќ

DanyвЂ™s
wrist
still
tingled
where
Quaithe
had
touched
her.
вЂњWhere
would
you
have
me
go?вЂќ
she
asked.

вЂњTo
go
north,
you
must
journey
south.
To
reach
the
west,
you
must
go
east.
To
go
forward
you
must
go
back,
and
to
touch
the
light
you
must
pass
beneath
the
shadow.вЂќ

Asshai,
Dany
thought.
She
would
have
me
go
to
Asshai.
вЂњWill
the
AsshaiвЂ™i
give
me
an
army?вЂќ
she
demanded.
вЂњWill
there
be
gold
for
me
in
Asshai?
Will
there
be
ships?
What
is
there
in
Asshai
that
I
will
not
find
in
Qarth?вЂќ

вЂњTruth,вЂќ
said
the
woman
in
the
mask.
And
bowing,
she
faded
back
into
the
crowd.

Rakharo
snorted
contempt
through
his
drooping
black
mustachios.
вЂњKhaleesi,
better
a
man
should
swallow
scorpions
than
trust
in
the
spawn
of
shadows,
who
dare
not
show
their
face
beneath
the
sun.
It
is
known.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
known,вЂќ
Aggo
agreed.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
had
watched
the
whole
exchange
from
his
cushions.
When
Dany
climbed
back
into
the
palanquin
beside
him,
he
said,
вЂњYour
savages
are
wiser
than
they
know.
Such
truths
as
the
AsshaiвЂ™i
hoard
are
not
like
to
make
you
smile.вЂќ
Then
he
pressed
another
cup
of
wine
on
her,
and
spoke
of
love
and
lust
and
other
trifles
all
the
way
back
to
his
manse.

In
the
quiet
of
her
chambers,
Dany
stripped
off
her
finery
and
donned
a
loose
robe
of
purple
silk.
Her
dragons
were
hungry,
so
she
chopped
up
a
snake
and
charred
the
pieces
over
a
brazier.
They
are
growing,
she
realized
as
she
watched
them
snap
and
squabble
over
the
blackened
flesh.
They
must
weigh
twice
what
they
had
in
Vaes
Tolorro.
Even
so,
it
would
be
years
before
they
were
large
enough
to
take
to
war.
And
they
must
be
trained
as
well,
or
they
will
lay
my
kingdom
waste.
For
all
her
Targaryen
blood,
Dany
had
not
the
least
idea
of
how
to
train
a
dragon.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
came
to
her
as
the
sun
was
going
down.
вЂњThe
Pureborn
refused
you?вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
said
they
would.
Come,
sit,
give
me
your
counsel.вЂќ
Dany
drew
him
down
to
the
cushions
beside
her,
and
Jhiqui
brought
them
a
bowl
of
purple
olives
and
onions
drowned
in
wine.

вЂњYou
will
get
no
help
in
this
city,
Khaleesi.вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
took
an
onion
between
thumb
and
forefinger.
вЂњEach
day
I
am
more
convinced
of
that
than
the
day
before.
The
Pureborn
see
no
farther
than
the
walls
of
Qarth,
and
XaroвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHe
asked
me
to
marry
him
again.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
and
I
know
why.вЂќ
When
the
knight
frowned,
his
heavy
black
brows
joined
together
above
his
deep-set
eyes.

вЂњHe
dreams
of
me,
day
and
night.вЂќ
She
laughed.

вЂњForgive
me,
my
queen,
but
it
is
your
dragons
he
dreams
of.вЂќ

вЂњXaro
assures
me
that
in
Qarth,
man
and
woman
each
retain
their
own
property
after
they
are
wed.
The
dragons
are
mine.вЂќ
She
smiled
as
Drogon
came
hopping
and
flapping
across
the
marble
floor
to
crawl
up
on
the
cushion
beside
her.

вЂњHe
tells
it
true
as
far
as
it
goes,
but
thereвЂ™s
one
thing
he
failed
to
mention.
The
Qartheen
have
a
curious
wedding
custom,
my
queen.
On
the
day
of
their
union,
a
wife
may
ask
a
token
of
love
from
her
husband.
Whatsoever
she
desires
of
his
worldly
goods,
he
must
grant.
And
he
may
ask
the
same
of
her.
One
thing
only
may
be
asked,
but
whatever
is
named
may
not
be
denied.вЂќ

вЂњOne
thing,вЂќ
she
repeated.
вЂњAnd
it
may
not
be
denied?вЂќ

вЂњWith
one
dragon,
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
rule
this
city,
but
one
ship
will
further
our
cause
but
little.вЂќ

Dany
nibbled
at
an
onion
and
reflected
ruefully
on
the
faithlessness
of
men.
вЂњWe
passed
through
the
bazaar
on
our
way
back
from
the
Hall
of
a
Thousand
Thrones,вЂќ
she
told
Ser
Jorah.
вЂњQuaithe
was
there.вЂќ
She
told
him
of
the
firemage
and
the
fiery
ladder,
and
what
the
woman
in
the
red
mask
had
told
her.

вЂњI
would
be
glad
to
leave
this
city,
if
truth
be
told,вЂќ
the
knight
said
when
she
was
done.
вЂњBut
not
for
Asshai.вЂќ

вЂњWhere,
then?вЂќ

вЂњEast,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњI
am
half
a
world
away
from
my
kingdom
even
here.
If
I
go
any
farther
east
I
may
never
find
my
way
home
to
Westeros.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
go
west,
you
risk
your
life.вЂќ

вЂњHouse
Targaryen
has
friends
in
the
Free
Cities,вЂќ
she
reminded
him.
вЂњTruer
friends
than
Xaro
or
the
Pureborn.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
mean
Illyrio
Mopatis,
I
wonder.
For
sufficient
gold,
Illyrio
would
sell
you
as
quickly
as
he
would
a
slave.вЂќ

вЂњMy
brother
and
I
were
guests
in
IllyrioвЂ™s
manse
for
half
a
year.
If
he
meant
to
sell
us,
he
could
have
done
it
then.вЂќ

вЂњHe
did
sell
you,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said.
вЂњTo
Khal
Drogo.вЂќ

Dany
flushed.
He
had
the
truth
of
it,
but
she
did
not
like
the
sharpness
with
which
he
put
it.
вЂњIllyrio
protected
us
from
the
UsurperвЂ™s
knives,
and
he
believed
in
my
brotherвЂ™s
cause.вЂќ

вЂњIllyrio
believes
in
no
cause
but
Illyrio.
Gluttons
are
greedy
men
as
a
rule,
and
magisters
are
devious.
Illyrio
Mopatis
is
both.
What
do
you
truly
know
of
him?вЂќ

вЂњI
know
that
he
gave
me
my
dragon
eggs.вЂќ

He
snorted.
вЂњIf
heвЂ™d
known
they
were
like
to
hatch,
heвЂ™d
would
have
sat
on
them
himself.вЂќ

That
made
her
smile
despite
herself.
вЂњOh,
I
have
no
doubt
of
that,
ser.
I
know
Illyrio
better
than
you
think.
I
was
a
child
when
I
left
his
manse
in
Pentos
to
wed
my
sun-and-stars,
but
I
was
neither
deaf
nor
blind.
And
I
am
no
child
now.вЂќ

вЂњEven
if
Illyrio
is
the
friend
you
think
him,вЂќ
the
knight
said
stubbornly,
вЂњhe
is
not
powerful
enough
to
enthrone
you
by
himself,
no
more
than
he
could
your
brother.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
rich,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњNot
so
rich
as
Xaro,
perhaps,
but
rich
enough
to
hire
ships
for
me,
and
men
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњSellswords
have
their
uses,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
admitted,
вЂњbut
you
will
not
win
your
fatherвЂ™s
throne
with
sweepings
from
the
Free
Cities.
Nothing
knits
a
broken
realm
together
so
quick
as
an
invading
army
on
its
soil.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
their
rightful
queen,вЂќ
Dany
protested.

вЂњYou
are
a
stranger
who
means
to
land
on
their
shores
with
an
army
of
outlanders
who
cannot
even
speak
the
Common
Tongue.
The
lords
of
Westeros
do
not
know
you,
and
have
every
reason
to
fear
and
mistrust
you.
You
must
win
them
over
before
you
sail.
A
few
at
least.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
how
am
I
to
do
that,
if
I
go
east
as
you
counsel?вЂќ

He
ate
an
olive
and
spit
out
the
pit
into
his
palm.
вЂњI
do
not
know,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
he
admitted,
вЂњbut
I
do
know
that
the
longer
you
remain
in
one
place,
the
easier
it
will
be
for
your
enemies
to
find
you.
The
name
Targaryen
still
frightens
them,
so
much
so
that
they
sent
a
man
to
murder
you
when
they
heard
you
were
with
child.
What
will
they
do
when
they
learn
of
your
dragons?вЂќ

Drogon
was
curled
up
beneath
her
arm,
as
hot
as
a
stone
that
has
soaked
all
day
in
the
blazing
sun.
Rhaegal
and
Viserion
were
fighting
over
a
scrap
of
meat,
buffeting
each
other
with
their
wings
as
smoke
hissed
from
their
nostrils.
My
furious
children,
she
thought.
They
must
not
come
to
harm.
вЂњThe
comet
led
me
to
Qarth
for
a
reason.
I
had
hoped
to
find
my
army
here,
but
it
seems
that
will
not
be.
What
else
remains,
I
ask
myself?вЂќ
I
am
afraid,
she
realized,
but
I
must
be
brave.
вЂњCome
the
morrow,
you
must
go
to
Pyat
Pree.вЂќ





TYRION

The
girl
never
wept.
Young
as
she
was,
Myrcella
Baratheon
was
a
princess
born.
And
a
Lannister,
despite
her
name,
Tyrion
reminded
himself,
as
much
JaimeвЂ™s
blood
as
CerseiвЂ™s.

To
be
sure,
her
smile
was
a
shade
tremulous
when
her
brothers
took
their
leave
of
her
on
the
deck
of
the
Seaswift,
but
the
girl
knew
the
proper
words
to
say,
and
she
said
them
with
courage
and
dignity.
When
the
time
came
to
part,
it
was
Prince
Tommen
who
cried,
and
Myrcella
who
gave
him
comfort.

Tyrion
looked
down
upon
the
farewells
from
the
high
deck
of
King
RobertвЂ™s
Hammer,
a
great
war
galley
of
four
hundred
oars.
RobвЂ™s
Hammer,
as
her
oarsmen
called
her,
would
form
the
main
strength
of
MyrcellaвЂ™s
escort.
Lionstar,
Bold
Wind,
and
Lady
Lyanna
would
sail
with
her
as
well.

It
made
Tyrion
more
than
a
little
uneasy
to
detach
so
great
a
part
of
their
already
inadequate
fleet,
depleted
as
it
was
by
the
loss
of
all
those
ships
that
had
sailed
with
Lord
Stannis
to
Dragonstone
and
never
returned,
but
Cersei
would
hear
of
nothing
less.
Perhaps
she
was
wise.
If
the
girl
was
captured
before
she
reached
Sunspear,
the
Dornish
alliance
would
fall
to
pieces.
So
far
Doran
Martell
had
done
no
more
than
call
his
banners.
Once
Myrcella
was
safe
in
Braavos,
he
had
pledged
to
move
his
strength
to
the
high
passes,
where
the
threat
might
make
some
of
the
Marcher
lords
rethink
their
loyalties
and
give
Stannis
pause
about
marching
north.
It
was
purely
a
feint,
however.
The
Martells
would
not
commit
to
actual
battle
unless
Dorne
itself
was
attacked,
and
Stannis
was
not
so
great
a
fool.
Though
some
of
his
bannermen
may
be,
Tyrion
reflected.
I
should
think
on
that.

He
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњYou
know
your
orders,
Captain.вЂќ

вЂњI
do,
my
lord.
We
are
to
follow
the
coast,
staying
always
in
sight
of
land,
until
we
reach
Crackclaw
Point.
From
there
we
are
to
strike
out
across
the
narrow
sea
for
Braavos.
On
no
account
are
we
to
sail
within
sight
of
Dragonstone.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
our
foes
should
chance
upon
you
nonetheless?вЂќ

вЂњIf
a
single
ship,
we
are
to
run
them
off
or
destroy
them.
If
there
are
more,
the
Bold
Wind
will
cleave
to
the
Seaswift
to
protect
her
while
the
rest
of
the
fleet
does
battle.вЂќ

Tyrion
nodded.
If
the
worst
happened,
the
little
Seaswift
ought
to
be
able
to
outrun
pursuit.
A
small
ship
with
big
sails,
she
was
faster
than
any
warship
afloat,
or
so
her
captain
had
claimed.
Once
Myrcella
reached
Braavos,
she
ought
to
be
safe.
He
was
sending
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
as
her
sworn
shield,
and
had
engaged
the
Braavosi
to
bring
her
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Sunspear.
Even
Lord
Stannis
would
hesitate
to
wake
the
anger
of
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
of
the
Free
Cities.
Traveling
from
KingвЂ™s
Landing
to
Dorne
by
way
of
Braavos
was
scarcely
the
most
direct
of
routes,
but
it
was
the
safestвЂ¦
or
so
he
hoped.

If
Lord
Stannis
knew
of
this
sailing,
he
could
not
choose
a
better
time
to
send
his
fleet
against
us.
Tyrion
glanced
back
to
where
the
Rush
emptied
out
into
Blackwater
Bay
and
was
relieved
to
see
no
signs
of
sails
on
the
wide
green
horizon.
At
last
report,
the
Baratheon
fleet
still
lay
off
StormвЂ™s
End,
where
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
continued
to
defy
the
besiegers
in
dead
RenlyвЂ™s
name.
Meanwhile,
TyrionвЂ™s
winch
towers
stood
three-quarters
complete.
Even
now
men
were
hoisting
heavy
blocks
of
stone
into
place,
no
doubt
cursing
him
for
making
them
work
through
the
festivities.
Let
them
curse.
Another
fortnight,
Stannis,
thatвЂ™s
all
I
require.
Another
fortnight
and
it
will
be
done.

Tyrion
watched
his
niece
kneel
before
the
High
Septon
to
receive
his
blessing
on
her
voyage.
Sunlight
caught
in
his
crystal
crown
and
spilled
rainbows
across
MyrcellaвЂ™s
upturned
face.
The
noise
from
the
riverside
made
it
impossible
to
hear
the
prayers.
He
hoped
the
gods
had
sharper
ears.
The
High
Septon
was
as
fat
as
a
house,
and
more
pompous
and
long
of
wind
than
even
Pycelle.
Enough,
old
man,
make
an
end
to
it,
Tyrion
thought
irritably.
The
gods
have
better
things
to
do
than
listen
to
you,
and
so
do
I.

When
at
last
the
droning
and
mumbling
was
done,
Tyrion
took
his
farewell
of
the
captain
of
RobвЂ™s
Hammer.
вЂњDeliver
my
niece
safely
to
Braavos,
and
there
will
be
a
knighthood
waiting
for
you
on
your
return,вЂќ
he
promised.

As
he
made
his
way
down
the
steep
plank
to
the
quay,
Tyrion
could
feel
unkind
eyes
upon
him.
The
galley
rocked
gently
and
the
movement
underfoot
made
his
waddle
worse
than
ever.
IвЂ™ll
wager
theyвЂ™d
love
to
snigger.
No
one
dared,
not
openly,
though
he
heard
mutterings
mingled
with
the
creak
of
wood
and
rope
and
the
rush
of
the
river
around
the
pilings.
They
do
not
love
me,
he
thought.
Well,
small
wonder.
IвЂ™m
well
fed
and
ugly,
and
they
are
starving.

Bronn
escorted
him
through
the
crowd
to
join
his
sister
and
her
sons.
Cersei
ignored
him,
preferring
to
lavish
her
smiles
on
their
cousin.
He
watched
her
charming
Lancel
with
eyes
as
green
as
the
rope
of
emeralds
around
her
slim
white
throat,
and
smiled
a
small
sly
smile
to
himself.
I
know
your
secret,
Cersei,
he
thought.
His
sister
had
oft
called
upon
the
High
Septon
of
late,
to
seek
the
blessings
of
the
gods
in
their
coming
struggle
with
Lord
StannisвЂ¦
or
so
she
would
have
him
believe.
In
truth,
after
a
brief
call
at
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
Cersei
would
don
a
plain
brown
travelerвЂ™s
cloak
and
steal
off
to
meet
a
certain
hedge
knight
with
the
unlikely
name
of
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack,
and
his
equally
unsavory
brothers
Osney
and
Osfryd.
Lancel
had
told
him
all
about
them.
Cersei
meant
to
use
the
Kettleblacks
to
buy
her
own
force
of
sellswords.

Well,
let
her
enjoy
her
plots.
She
was
much
sweeter
when
she
thought
she
was
outwitting
him.
The
Kettleblacks
would
charm
her,
take
her
coin,
and
promise
her
anything
she
asked,
and
why
not,
when
Bronn
was
matching
every
copper
penny,
coin
for
coin?
Amiable
rogues
all
three,
the
brothers
were
in
truth
much
more
skilled
at
deceit
than
theyвЂ™d
ever
been
at
bloodletting.
Cersei
had
managed
to
buy
herself
three
hollow
drums;
they
would
make
all
the
fierce
booming
sounds
she
required,
but
there
was
nothing
inside.
It
amused
Tyrion
no
end.

Horns
blew
fanfares
as
Lionstar
and
Lady
Lyanna
pushed
out
from
shore,
moving
downriver
to
clear
the
way
for
Seaswift.
A
few
cheers
went
up
from
the
crush
along
the
banks,
as
thin
and
ragged
as
the
clouds
scuttling
overhead.
Myrcella
smiled
and
waved
from
the
deck.
Behind
her
stood
Arys
Oakheart,
his
white
cloak
streaming.
The
captain
ordered
lines
cast
off,
and
oars
pushed
the
Seaswift
out
into
the
lusty
current
of
the
Blackwater
Rush,
where
her
sails
blossomed
in
the
windвЂ”common
white
sails,
as
Tyrion
had
insisted,
not
sheets
of
Lannister
crimson.
Prince
Tommen
sobbed.
вЂњYou
mew
like
a
suckling
babe,вЂќ
his
brother
hissed
at
him.
вЂњPrinces
arenвЂ™t
supposed
to
cry.вЂќ

вЂњPrince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
cried
the
day
Princess
Naerys
wed
his
brother
Aegon,вЂќ
Sansa
Stark
said,
вЂњand
the
twins
Ser
Arryk
and
Ser
Erryk
died
with
tears
on
their
cheeks
after
each
had
given
the
other
a
mortal
wound.вЂќ

вЂњBe
quiet,
or
IвЂ™ll
have
Ser
Meryn
give
you
a
mortal
wound,вЂќ
Joffrey
told
his
betrothed.
Tyrion
glanced
at
his
sister,
but
Cersei
was
engrossed
in
something
Ser
Balon
Swann
was
telling
her.
Can
she
truly
be
so
blind
as
to
what
he
is?
he
wondered.

Out
on
the
river,
Bold
Wind
unshipped
her
oars
and
glided
downstream
in
the
wake
of
Seaswift.
Last
came
King
RobertвЂ™s
Hammer,
the
might
of
the
royal
fleetвЂ¦
or
at
least
that
portion
that
had
not
fled
to
Dragonstone
last
year
with
Stannis.
Tyrion
had
chosen
the
ships
with
care,
avoiding
any
whose
captains
might
be
of
doubtful
loyalty,
according
to
VarysвЂ¦
but
as
Varys
himself
was
of
doubtful
loyalty,
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
remained.
I
rely
too
much
on
Varys,
he
reflected.
I
need
my
own
informers.
Not
that
IвЂ™d
trust
them
either.
Trust
would
get
you
killed.

He
wondered
again
about
Littlefinger.
There
had
been
no
word
from
Petyr
Baelish
since
he
had
ridden
off
for
Bitterbridge.
That
might
mean
nothingвЂ”or
everything.
Even
Varys
could
not
say.
The
eunuch
had
suggested
that
perhaps
Littlefinger
had
met
some
misfortune
on
the
roads.
He
might
even
be
slain.
Tyrion
had
snorted
in
derision.
вЂњIf
Littlefinger
is
dead,
then
IвЂ™m
a
giant.вЂќ
More
likely,
the
Tyrells
were
balking
at
the
proposed
marriage.
Tyrion
could
scarcely
blame
them.
If
I
were
Mace
Tyrell,
I
would
sooner
have
JoffreyвЂ™s
head
on
a
pike
than
his
cock
in
my
daughter.

The
little
fleet
was
well
out
into
the
bay
when
Cersei
indicated
that
it
was
time
to
go.
Bronn
brought
TyrionвЂ™s
horse
and
helped
him
mount.
That
was
Podrick
PayneвЂ™s
task,
but
they
had
left
Pod
back
at
the
Red
Keep.
The
gaunt
sellsword
made
for
a
much
more
reassuring
presence
than
the
boy
would
have.

The
narrow
streets
were
lined
by
men
of
the
City
Watch,
holding
back
the
crowd
with
the
shafts
of
their
spears.
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
went
in
front,
heading
a
wedge
of
mounted
lancers
in
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks.
Behind
him
came
Ser
Aron
Santagar
and
Ser
Balon
Swann,
bearing
the
kingвЂ™s
banners,
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon.

King
Joffrey
followed
on
a
tall
grey
palfrey,
a
golden
crown
set
upon
his
golden
curls.
Sansa
Stark
rode
a
chesnut
mare
at
his
side,
looking
neither
right
nor
left,
her
thick
auburn
hair
flowing
to
her
shoulders
beneath
a
net
of
moonstones.
Two
of
the
Kingsguard
flanked
the
couple,
the
Hound
on
the
kingвЂ™s
right
hand
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
to
the
left
of
the
Stark
girl.

Next
came
Tommen,
snuffling,
with
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
in
his
white
armor
and
cloak,
and
then
Cersei,
accompanied
by
Ser
Lancel
and
protected
by
Meryn
Trant
and
Boros
Blount.
Tyrion
fell
in
with
his
sister.
After
them
followed
the
High
Septon
in
his
litter,
and
a
long
tail
of
other
courtiersвЂ”Ser
Horas
Redwyne,
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughter,
Jalabhar
Xho,
Lord
Gyles
Rosby,
and
the
rest.
A
double
column
of
guardsmen
brought
up
the
rear.

The
unshaven
and
the
unwashed
stared
at
the
riders
with
dull
resentment
from
behind
the
line
of
spears.
I
like
this
not
one
speck,
Tyrion
thought.
Bronn
had
a
score
of
sellswords
scattered
through
the
crowd
with
orders
to
stop
any
trouble
before
it
started.
Perhaps
Cersei
had
similarly
disposed
her
Kettleblacks.
Somehow
Tyrion
did
not
think
it
would
help
much.
If
the
fire
was
too
hot,
you
could
hardly
keep
the
pudding
from
scorching
by
tossing
a
handful
of
raisins
in
the
pot.

They
crossed
FishmongerвЂ™s
Square
and
rode
along
Muddy
Way
before
turning
onto
the
narrow,
curving
Hook
to
begin
their
climb
up
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill.
A
few
voices
raised
a
cry
of
вЂњJoffrey!
All
hail,
all
hail!вЂќ
as
the
young
king
rode
by,
but
for
every
man
who
picked
up
the
shout,
a
hundred
kept
their
silence.
The
Lannisters
moved
through
a
sea
of
ragged
men
and
hungry
women,
breasting
a
tide
of
sullen
eyes.
Just
ahead
of
him,
Cersei
was
laughing
at
something
Lancel
had
said,
though
he
suspected
her
merriment
was
feigned.
She
could
not
be
oblivious
to
the
unrest
around
them,
but
his
sister
always
believed
in
putting
on
the
brave
show.

Halfway
along
the
route,
a
wailing
woman
forced
her
way
between
two
watchmen
and
ran
out
into
the
street
in
front
of
the
king
and
his
companions,
holding
the
corpse
of
her
dead
baby
above
her
head.
It
was
blue
and
swollen,
grotesque,
but
the
real
horror
was
the
motherвЂ™s
eyes.
Joffrey
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
he
meant
to
ride
her
down,
but
Sansa
Stark
leaned
over
and
said
something
to
him.
The
king
fumbled
in
his
purse,
and
flung
the
woman
a
silver
stag.
The
coin
bounced
off
the
child
and
rolled
away,
under
the
legs
of
the
gold
cloaks
and
into
the
crowd,
where
a
dozen
men
began
to
fight
for
it.
The
mother
never
once
blinked.
Her
skinny
arms
were
trembling
from
the
dead
weight
of
her
son.

вЂњLeave
her,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Cersei
called
out
to
the
king,
вЂњsheвЂ™s
beyond
our
help,
poor
thing.вЂќ

The
mother
heard
her.
Somehow
the
queenвЂ™s
voice
cut
through
the
womanвЂ™s
ravaged
wits.
Her
slack
face
twisted
in
loathing.
вЂњWhore!вЂќ
she
shrieked.
вЂњKingslayerвЂ™s
whore!
Brotherfucker!вЂќ
Her
dead
child
dropped
from
her
arms
like
a
sack
of
flour
as
she
pointed
at
Cersei.
вЂњBrotherfucker
brotherfucker
brotherfucker.вЂќ

Tyrion
never
saw
who
threw
the
dung.
He
only
heard
SansaвЂ™s
gasp
and
JoffreyвЂ™s
bellowed
curse,
and
when
he
turned
his
head,
the
king
was
wiping
brown
filth
from
his
cheek.
There
was
more
caked
in
his
golden
hair
and
spattered
over
SansaвЂ™s
legs.

вЂњWho
threw
that?вЂќ
Joffrey
screamed.
He
pushed
his
fingers
into
his
hair,
made
a
furious
face,
and
flung
away
another
handful
of
dung.
вЂњI
want
the
man
who
threw
that!вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњA
hundred
golden
dragons
to
the
man
who
gives
him
up.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
up
there!вЂќ
someone
shouted
from
the
crowd.
The
king
wheeled
his
horse
in
a
circle
to
survey
the
rooftops
and
open
balconies
above
them.
In
the
crowd
people
were
pointing,
shoving,
cursing
one
another
and
the
king.

вЂњPlease,
Your
Grace,
let
him
go,вЂќ
Sansa
pleaded.

The
king
paid
her
no
heed.
вЂњBring
me
the
man
who
flung
that
filth!вЂќ
Joffrey
commanded.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
lick
it
off
me
or
IвЂ™ll
have
his
head.
Dog,
you
bring
him
here!вЂќ

Obedient,
Sandor
Clegane
swung
down
from
his
saddle,
but
there
was
no
way
through
that
wall
of
flesh,
let
alone
to
the
roof.
Those
closest
to
him
began
to
squirm
and
shove
to
get
away,
while
others
pushed
forward
to
see.
Tyrion
smelled
disaster.
вЂњClegane,
leave
off,
the
man
is
long
fled.вЂќ

вЂњI
want
him!вЂќ
Joffrey
pointed
at
the
roof.
вЂњHe
was
up
there!
Dog,
cut
through
them
and
bringвЂ”вЂќ

A
tumult
of
sound
drowned
his
last
words,
a
rolling
thunder
of
rage
and
fear
and
hatred
that
engulfed
them
from
all
sides.
вЂњBastard!вЂќ
someone
screamed
at
Joffrey,
вЂњbastard
monster.вЂќ
Other
voices
flung
calls
of
вЂњWhoreвЂќ
and
вЂњBrotherfuckerвЂќ
at
the
queen,
while
Tyrion
was
pelted
with
shouts
of
вЂњFreakвЂќ
and
вЂњHalfman.вЂќ
Mixed
in
with
the
abuse,
he
heard
a
few
cries
of
вЂњJusticeвЂќ
and
вЂњRobb,
King
Robb,
the
Young
Wolf,вЂќ
of
вЂњStannis!вЂќ
and
even
вЂњRenly!вЂќ
From
both
sides
of
the
street,
the
crowd
surged
against
the
spear
shafts
while
the
gold
cloaks
struggled
to
hold
the
line.
Stones
and
dung
and
fouler
things
whistled
overhead.
вЂњFeed
us!вЂќ
a
woman
shrieked.
вЂњBread!вЂќ
boomed
a
man
behind
her.
вЂњWe
want
bread,
bastard!вЂќ
In
a
heartbeat,
a
thousand
voices
took
up
the
chant.
King
Joffrey
and
King
Robb
and
King
Stannis
were
forgotten,
and
King
Bread
ruled
alone.
вЂњBread,вЂќ
they
clamored.
вЂњBread,
bread!вЂќ

Tyrion
spurred
to
his
sisterвЂ™s
side,
yelling,
вЂњBack
to
the
castle.
Now.вЂќ
Cersei
gave
a
curt
nod,
and
Ser
Lancel
unsheathed
his
sword.
Ahead
of
the
column,
Jacelyn
Bywater
was
roaring
commands.
His
riders
lowered
their
lances
and
drove
forward
in
a
wedge.
The
king
was
wheeling
his
palfrey
around
in
anxious
circles
while
hands
reached
past
the
line
of
gold
cloaks,
grasping
for
him.
One
managed
to
get
hold
of
his
leg,
but
only
for
an
instant.
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
sword
slashed
down,
parting
hand
from
wrist.
вЂњRide!вЂќ
Tyrion
shouted
at
his
nephew,
giving
the
horse
a
sharp
smack
on
the
rump.
The
animal
reared,
trumpeting,
and
plunged
ahead,
the
press
shattering
before
him.

Tyrion
drove
into
the
gap
hard
on
the
kingвЂ™s
hooves.
Bronn
kept
pace,
sword
in
hand.
A
jagged
rock
flew
past
his
head
as
he
rode,
and
a
rotten
cabbage
exploded
against
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
shield.
To
their
left,
three
gold
cloaks
went
down
under
the
surge,
and
then
the
crowd
was
rushing
forward,
trampling
the
fallen
men.
The
Hound
had
vanished
behind,
though
his
riderless
horse
galloped
beside
them.
Tyrion
saw
Aron
Santagar
pulled
from
the
saddle,
the
gold-and-black
Baratheon
stag
torn
from
his
grasp.
Ser
Balon
Swann
dropped
the
Lannister
lion
to
draw
his
longsword.
He
slashed
right
and
left
as
the
fallen
banner
was
ripped
apart,
the
thousand
ragged
pieces
swirling
away
like
crimson
leaves
in
a
stormwind.
In
an
instant
they
were
gone.
Someone
staggered
in
front
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
horse
and
shrieked
as
the
king
rode
him
down.
Whether
it
had
been
man,
woman,
or
child
Tyrion
could
not
have
said.
Joffrey
was
galloping
at
his
side,
whey-faced,
with
Ser
Mandon
Moore
a
white
shadow
on
his
left.

And
suddenly
the
madness
was
behind
and
they
were
clattering
across
the
cobbled
square
that
fronted
on
the
castle
barbican.
A
line
of
spearmen
held
the
gates.
Ser
Jacelyn
was
wheeling
his
lances
around
for
another
charge.
The
spears
parted
to
let
the
kingвЂ™s
party
pass
under
the
portcullis.
Pale
red
walls
loomed
up
about
them,
reassuringly
high
and
aswarm
with
crossbowmen.

Tyrion
did
not
recall
dismounting.
Ser
Mandon
was
helping
the
shaken
king
off
his
horse
when
Cersei,
Tommen,
and
Lancel
rode
through
the
gates
with
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Boros
close
behind.
Boros
had
blood
smeared
along
his
blade,
while
MerynвЂ™s
white
cloak
had
been
torn
from
his
back.
Ser
Balon
Swann
rode
in
helmetless,
his
mount
lathered
and
bleeding
at
the
mouth.
Horas
Redwyne
brought
in
Lady
Tanda,
half
crazed
with
fear
for
her
daughter
Lollys,
who
had
been
knocked
from
the
saddle
and
left
behind.
Lord
Gyles,
more
grey
of
face
than
ever,
stammered
out
a
tale
of
seeing
the
High
Septon
spilled
from
his
litter,
screeching
prayers
as
the
crowd
swept
over
him.
Jalabhar
Xho
said
he
thought
heвЂ™d
seen
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
of
the
Kingsguard
riding
back
toward
the
High
SeptonвЂ™s
overturned
litter,
but
he
was
not
certain.

Tyrion
was
dimly
aware
of
a
maester
asking
if
he
was
injured.
He
pushed
his
way
across
the
yard
to
where
his
nephew
stood,
his
dung-encrusted
crown
askew.
вЂњTraitors,вЂќ
Joffrey
was
babbling
excitedly,
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
all
their
heads,
IвЂ™llвЂ”вЂќ

The
dwarf
slapped
his
flushed
face
so
hard
the
crown
flew
from
JoffreyвЂ™s
head.
Then
he
shoved
him
with
both
hands
and
knocked
him
sprawling.
вЂњYou
blind
bloody
fool.вЂќ

вЂњThey
were
traitors,вЂќ
Joffrey
squealed
from
the
ground.
вЂњThey
called
me
names
and
attacked
me!вЂќ

вЂњYou
set
your
dog
on
them!
What
did
you
imagine
they
would
do,
bend
the
knee
meekly
while
the
Hound
lopped
off
some
limbs?
You
spoiled
witless
little
boy,
youвЂ™ve
killed
Clegane
and
gods
know
how
many
more,
and
yet
you
come
through
unscratched.
Damn
you!вЂќ
And
he
kicked
him.
It
felt
so
good
he
might
have
done
more,
but
Ser
Mandon
Moore
pulled
him
off
as
Joffrey
howled,
and
then
Bronn
was
there
to
take
him
in
hand.
Cersei
knelt
over
her
son,
while
Ser
Balon
Swann
restrained
Ser
Lancel.
Tyrion
wrenched
free
of
BronnвЂ™s
grip.
вЂњHow
many
are
still
out
there?вЂќ
he
shouted
to
no
one
and
everyone.

вЂњMy
daughter,вЂќ
cried
Lady
Tanda.
вЂњPlease,
someone
must
go
back
for
LollysвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSer
Preston
is
not
returned,вЂќ
Ser
Boros
Blount
reported,
вЂњnor
Aron
Santagar.вЂќ

вЂњNor
Wet
Nurse,вЂќ
said
Ser
Horas
Redwyne.
That
was
the
mocking
name
the
other
squires
had
hung
on
young
Tyrek
Lannister.

Tyrion
glanced
round
the
yard.
вЂњWhereвЂ™s
the
Stark
girl?вЂќ

For
a
moment
no
one
answered.
Finally
Joffrey
said,
вЂњShe
was
riding
by
me.
I
donвЂ™t
know
where
she
went.вЂќ

Tyrion
pressed
blunt
fingers
into
his
throbbing
temples.
If
Sansa
Stark
had
come
to
harm,
Jaime
was
as
good
as
dead.
вЂњSer
Mandon,
you
were
her
shield.вЂќ

Ser
Mandon
Moore
remained
untroubled.
вЂњWhen
they
mobbed
the
Hound,
I
thought
first
of
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
rightly
so,вЂќ
Cersei
put
in.
вЂњBoros,
Meryn,
go
back
and
find
the
girl.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
my
daughter,вЂќ
Lady
Tanda
sobbed.
вЂњPlease,
sersвЂ¦вЂќ

Ser
Boros
did
not
look
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
the
safety
of
the
castle.
вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
he
told
the
queen,
вЂњthe
sight
of
our
white
cloaks
might
enrage
the
mob.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
stomached
all
he
cared
to.
вЂњThe
Others
take
your
fucking
cloaks!
Take
them
off
if
youвЂ™re
afraid
to
wear
them,
you
bloody
oafвЂ¦
but
find
me
Sansa
Stark
or
I
swear,
IвЂ™ll
have
Shagga
split
that
ugly
head
of
yours
in
two
to
see
if
thereвЂ™s
anything
inside
but
black
pudding.вЂќ

Ser
Boros
went
purple
with
rage.
вЂњYou
would
call
me
ugly,
you?вЂќ
He
started
to
raise
the
bloody
sword
still
clutched
in
his
mailed
fist.
Bronn
shoved
Tyrion
unceremoniously
behind
him.

вЂњStop
it!вЂќ
Cersei
snapped.
вЂњBoros,
youвЂ™ll
do
as
youвЂ™re
bid,
or
weвЂ™ll
find
someone
else
to
wear
that
cloak.
Your
oathвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThere
she
is!вЂќ
Joffrey
shouted,
pointing.

Sandor
Clegane
cantered
briskly
through
the
gates
astride
SansaвЂ™s
chestnut
courser.
The
girl
was
seated
behind,
both
arms
tight
around
the
HoundвЂ™s
chest.

Tyrion
called
to
her.
вЂњAre
you
hurt,
Lady
Sansa?вЂќ

Blood
was
trickling
down
SansaвЂ™s
brow
from
a
deep
gash
on
her
scalp.
вЂњTheyвЂ¦
they
were
throwing
thingsвЂ¦
rocks
and
filth,
eggsвЂ¦
I
tried
to
tell
them,
I
had
no
bread
to
give
them.
A
man
tried
to
pull
me
from
the
saddle.
The
Hound
killed
him,
I
thinkвЂ¦
his
armвЂ¦вЂќ
Her
eyes
widened
and
she
put
a
hand
over
her
mouth.
вЂњHe
cut
off
his
arm.вЂќ

Clegane
lifted
her
to
the
ground.
His
white
cloak
was
torn
and
stained,
and
blood
seeped
through
a
jagged
tear
in
his
left
sleeve.
вЂњThe
little
birdвЂ™s
bleeding.
Someone
take
her
back
to
her
cage
and
see
to
that
cut.вЂќ
Maester
Frenken
scurried
forward
to
obey.
вЂњThey
did
for
Santagar,вЂќ
the
Hound
continued.
вЂњFour
men
held
him
down
and
took
turns
bashing
at
his
head
with
a
cobblestone.
I
gutted
one,
not
that
it
did
Ser
Aron
much
good.вЂќ

Lady
Tanda
approached
him.
вЂњMy
daughterвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњNever
saw
her.вЂќ
The
Hound
glanced
around
the
yard,
scowling.
вЂњWhereвЂ™s
my
horse?
If
anythingвЂ™s
happened
to
that
horse,
someoneвЂ™s
going
to
pay.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
running
with
us
for
a
time,вЂќ
Tyrion
said,
вЂњbut
I
donвЂ™t
know
what
became
of
him
after
that.вЂќ

вЂњFire!вЂќ
a
voice
screamed
down
from
atop
the
barbican.
вЂњMy
lords,
thereвЂ™s
smoke
in
the
city.
Flea
BottomвЂ™s
afire.вЂќ

Tyrion
was
inutterably
weary,
but
there
was
no
time
for
despair.
вЂњBronn,
take
as
many
men
as
you
need
and
see
that
the
water
wagons
are
not
molested,вЂќ
Gods
be
good,
the
wildfire,
if
any
blaze
should
reach
thatвЂ¦вЂњWe
can
lose
all
of
Flea
Bottom
if
we
must,
but
on
no
account
must
the
fire
reach
the
Guildhall
of
the
Alchemists,
is
that
understood?
Clegane,
youвЂ™ll
go
with
him.вЂќ

For
half
a
heartbeat,
Tyrion
thought
he
glimpsed
fear
in
the
HoundвЂ™s
dark
eyes.
Fire,
he
realized.
The
Others
take
me,
of
course
he
hates
flre,
heвЂ™s
tasted
it
too
well.
The
look
was
gone
in
an
instant,
replaced
by
CleganeвЂ™s
familiar
scowl.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
go,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњthough
not
by
your
command.
I
need
to
find
that
horse.вЂќ

Tyrion
turned
to
the
three
remaining
knights
of
the
Kingsguard.
вЂњEach
of
you
will
ride
escort
to
a
herald.
Command
the
people
to
return
to
their
homes.
Any
man
found
on
the
streets
after
the
last
peal
of
the
evenfall
bell
will
be
killed.вЂќ

вЂњOur
place
is
beside
the
king,вЂќ
Ser
Meryn
said,
complacent.

Cersei
reared
up
like
a
viper.
вЂњYour
place
is
where
my
brother
says
it
is,вЂќ
she
spit.
вЂњThe
Hand
speaks
with
the
kingвЂ™s
own
voice,
and
disobedience
is
treason.вЂќ

Boros
and
Meryn
exchanged
a
look.
вЂњShould
we
wear
our
cloaks,
Your
Grace?вЂќ
Ser
Boros
asked.

вЂњGo
naked
for
all
I
care.
It
might
remind
the
mob
that
youвЂ™re
men.
TheyвЂ™re
like
to
have
forgotten
after
seeing
the
way
you
behaved
out
there
in
the
street.вЂќ

Tyrion
let
his
sister
rage.
His
head
was
throbbing.
He
thought
he
could
smell
smoke,
though
perhaps
it
was
just
the
scent
of
his
nerves
fraying.

Two
of
the
Stone
Crows
guarded
the
door
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
вЂњFind
me
Timett
son
of
Timett.вЂќ

вЂњStone
Crows
do
not
run
squeaking
after
Burned
Men,вЂќ
one
of
the
wildlings
informed
him
haughtily.

For
a
moment
Tyrion
had
forgotten
who
he
was
dealing
with.
вЂњThen
find
me
Shagga.вЂќ

вЂњShagga
sleeps.вЂќ

It
was
an
effort
not
to
scream.
вЂњWake.
Him.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
no
easy
thing
to
wake
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,вЂќ
the
man
complained.
вЂњHis
wrath
is
fearsome.вЂќ
He
went
off
grumbling.

The
clansman
wandered
in
yawning
and
scratching.
вЂњHalf
the
city
is
rioting,
the
other
half
is
burning,
and
Shagga
lies
snoring,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.

вЂњShagga
mislikes
your
muddy
water
here,
so
he
must
drink
your
weak
ale
and
sour
wine,
and
after
his
head
hurts.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
Shae
in
a
manse
near
the
Iron
Gate.
I
want
you
to
go
to
her
and
keep
her
safe,
whatever
may
come.вЂќ

The
huge
man
smiled,
his
teeth
a
yellow
crevasse
in
the
hairy
wilderness
of
his
beard.
вЂњShagga
will
fetch
her
here.вЂќ

вЂњJust
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
her.
Tell
her
I
will
come
to
her
as
soon
as
I
may.
This
very
night,
perhaps,
or
on
the
morrow
for
a
certainty.вЂќ

Yet
by
evenfall
the
city
was
still
in
turmoil,
though
Bronn
reported
that
the
fires
were
quenched
and
most
of
the
roving
mobs
dispersed.
Much
as
Tyrion
yearned
for
the
comfort
of
ShaeвЂ™s
arms,
he
realized
he
would
go
nowhere
that
night.

Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
delivered
the
butcherвЂ™s
bill
as
he
was
supping
on
a
cold
capon
and
brown
bread
in
the
gloom
of
his
solar.
Dusk
had
faded
to
darkness
by
then,
but
when
his
servants
came
to
light
his
candles
and
start
a
fire
in
the
hearth,
Tyrion
had
roared
at
them
and
sent
them
running.
His
mood
was
as
black
as
the
chamber,
and
Bywater
said
nothing
to
lighten
it.

The
list
of
the
slain
was
topped
by
the
High
Septon,
ripped
apart
as
he
squealed
to
his
gods
for
mercy.
Starving
men
take
a
hard
view
of
priests
too
fat
to
walk,
Tyrion
reflected.

Ser
PrestonвЂ™s
corpse
had
been
overlooked
at
first;
the
gold
cloaks
had
been
searching
for
a
knight
in
white
armor,
and
he
had
been
stabbed
and
hacked
so
cruelly
that
he
was
red-brown
from
head
to
heel.

Ser
Aron
Santagar
had
been
found
in
a
gutter,
his
head
a
red
pulp
inside
a
crushed
helm.

Lady
TandaвЂ™s
daughter
had
surrendered
her
maidenhood
to
half
a
hundred
shouting
men
behind
a
tannerвЂ™s
shop.
The
gold
cloaks
found
her
wandering
naked
on
Sowbelly
Row.

Tyrek
was
still
missing,
as
was
the
High
SeptonвЂ™s
crystal
crown.
Nine
gold
cloaks
had
been
slain,
two
score
wounded.
No
one
had
troubled
to
count
how
many
of
the
mob
had
died.

вЂњI
want
Tyrek
found,
alive
or
dead,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
curtly
when
Bywater
was
done.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
no
more
than
a
boy.
Son
to
my
late
uncle
Tygett.
His
father
was
always
kind
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
find
him.
The
septonвЂ™s
crown
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Others
can
bugger
each
other
with
the
septonвЂ™s
crown,
for
all
I
care.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
you
named
me
to
command
the
Watch,
you
told
me
you
wanted
plain
truth,
always.вЂќ

вЂњSomehow
I
have
a
feeling
I
am
not
going
to
like
whatever
youвЂ™re
about
to
say,вЂќ
Tyrion
said
gloomily.

вЂњWe
held
the
city
today,
my
lord,
but
I
make
no
promises
for
the
morrow.
The
kettle
is
close
to
boiling.
So
many
thieves
and
murderers
are
abroad
that
no
manвЂ™s
house
is
safe,
the
bloody
flux
is
spreading
in
the
stews
along
Pisswater
Bend,
thereвЂ™s
no
food
to
be
had
for
copper
nor
silver.
Where
before
you
heard
only
mutterings
from
the
gutter,
now
thereвЂ™s
open
talk
of
treason
in
guildhalls
and
markets.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
need
more
men?вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
trust
half
the
men
I
have
now.
Slynt
tripled
the
size
of
the
Watch,
but
it
takes
more
than
a
gold
cloak
to
make
a
watchman.
There
are
good
men
and
loyal
among
the
new
recruits,
but
also
more
brutes,
sots,
cravens,
and
traitors
than
youвЂ™d
care
to
know.
TheyвЂ™re
half-trained
and
undisciplined,
and
what
loyalty
they
have
is
to
their
own
skins.
If
it
comes
to
battle,
theyвЂ™ll
not
hold,
I
fear.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
expected
them
to,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњOnce
our
walls
are
breeched,
we
are
lost,
IвЂ™ve
known
that
from
the
start.вЂќ

вЂњMy
men
are
largely
drawn
from
the
smallfolk.
They
walk
the
same
streets,
drink
in
the
same
winesinks,
spoon
down
their
bowls
of
brown
in
the
same
pot-shops.
Your
eunuch
must
have
told
you,
there
is
small
love
for
the
Lannisters
in
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Many
still
remember
how
your
lord
father
sacked
the
city,
when
Aerys
opened
the
gates
to
him.
They
whisper
that
the
gods
are
punishing
us
for
the
sins
of
your
HouseвЂ”for
your
brotherвЂ™s
murder
of
King
Aerys,
for
the
butchery
of
RhaegarвЂ™s
children,
for
the
execution
of
Eddard
Stark
and
the
savagery
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
justice.
Some
talk
openly
of
how
much
better
things
were
when
Robert
was
king,
and
hint
that
times
would
be
better
again
with
Stannis
on
the
throne.
In
pot-shops
and
winesinks
and
brothels,
you
hear
these
thingsвЂ”and
in
the
barracks
and
guardhalls
as
well,
I
fear.вЂќ

вЂњThey
hate
my
family,
is
that
what
you
are
telling
me?вЂќ

вЂњAyeвЂ¦
and
will
turn
on
them,
if
the
chance
comes.вЂќ

вЂњMe
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњAsk
your
eunuch.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
asking
you.вЂќ

BywaterвЂ™s
deep-set
eyes
met
the
dwarfвЂ™s
mismatched
ones,
and
did
not
blink.
вЂњYou
most
of
all,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњMost
of
all?вЂќ
The
injustice
was
like
to
choke
him.
вЂњIt
was
Joffrey
who
told
them
to
eat
their
dead,
Joffrey
who
set
his
dog
on
them.
How
could
they
blame
me?вЂќ

вЂњHis
Grace
is
but
a
boy.
In
the
streets,
it
is
said
that
he
has
evil
councillors.
The
queen
has
never
been
known
as
a
friend
to
the
commons,
nor
is
Lord
Varys
called
the
Spider
out
of
loveвЂ¦
but
it
is
you
they
blame
most.
Your
sister
and
the
eunuch
were
here
when
times
were
better
under
King
Robert,
but
you
were
not.
They
say
that
youвЂ™ve
filled
the
city
with
swaggering
sellswords
and
unwashed
savages,
brutes
who
take
what
they
want
and
follow
no
laws
but
their
own.
They
say
you
exiled
Janos
Slynt
because
you
found
him
too
bluff
and
honest
for
your
liking.
They
say
you
threw
wise
and
gentle
Pycelle
into
the
dungeons
when
he
dared
raise
his
voice
against
you.
Some
even
claim
that
you
mean
to
seize
the
Iron
Throne
for
your
own.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
and
I
am
a
monster
besides,
hideous
and
misshapen,
never
forget
that.вЂќ
His
hand
coiled
into
a
fist.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
heard
enough.
We
both
have
work
to
attend
to.
Leave
me.вЂќ

Perhaps
my
lord
father
was
right
to
despise
me
all
these
years,
if
this
is
the
best
I
can
achieve,
Tyrion
thought
when
he
was
alone.
He
stared
down
at
the
remains
of
his
supper,
his
belly
roiling
at
the
sight
of
the
cold
greasy
capon.
Disgusted,
he
pushed
it
away,
shouted
for
Pod,
and
sent
the
boy
running
to
summon
Varys
and
Bronn.
My
most
trusted
advisers
are
a
eunuch
and
a
sellsword,
and
my
ladyвЂ™s
a
whore.
What
does
that
say
of
me?

Bronn
complained
of
the
gloom
when
he
arrived,
and
insisted
on
a
fire
in
the
hearth.
It
was
blazing
by
the
time
Varys
made
his
appearance.
вЂњWhere
have
you
been?вЂќ
Tyrion
demanded.

вЂњAbout
the
kingвЂ™s
business,
my
sweet
lord.вЂќ

вЂњAh,
yes,
the
king,вЂќ
Tyrion
muttered.
вЂњMy
nephew
is
not
fit
to
sit
a
privy,
let
alone
the
Iron
Throne.вЂќ

Varys
shrugged.
вЂњAn
apprentice
must
be
taught
his
trade.вЂќ

вЂњHalf
the
вЂ™prentices
on
Reeking
Lane
could
rule
better
than
this
king
of
yours.вЂќ
Bronn
seated
himself
across
the
table
and
pulled
a
wing
off
the
capon.

Tyrion
had
made
a
practice
of
ignoring
the
sellswordвЂ™s
frequent
insolences,
but
tonight
he
found
it
galling.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
recall
giving
you
leave
to
finish
my
supper.вЂќ

вЂњYou
didnвЂ™t
look
to
be
eating
it,вЂќ
Bronn
said
through
a
mouthful
of
meat.
вЂњCityвЂ™s
starving,
itвЂ™s
a
crime
to
waste
food.
You
have
any
wine?вЂќ

Next
heвЂ™ll
want
me
to
pour
it
for
him,
Tyrion
thought
darkly.
вЂњYou
go
too
far,вЂќ
he
warned.

вЂњAnd
you
never
go
far
enough.вЂќ
Bronn
tossed
the
wingbone
to
the
rushes.
вЂњEver
think
how
easy
life
would
be
if
the
other
one
had
been
born
first?вЂќ
He
thrust
his
fingers
inside
the
capon
and
tore
off
a
handful
of
breast.
вЂњThe
weepy
one,
Tommen.
Seems
like
heвЂ™d
do
whatever
he
was
told,
as
a
good
king
should.вЂќ

A
chill
crept
down
TyrionвЂ™s
spine
as
he
realized
what
the
sellsword
was
hinting
at.
If
Tommen
was
kingвЂ¦

There
was
only
one
way
Tommen
would
become
king.
No,
he
could
not
even
think
it.
Joffrey
was
his
own
blood,
and
JaimeвЂ™s
son
as
much
as
CerseiвЂ™s.
вЂњI
could
have
your
head
off
for
saying
that,вЂќ
he
told
Bronn,
but
the
sellsword
only
laughed.

вЂњFriends,вЂќ
said
Varys,
вЂњquarreling
will
not
serve
us.
I
beg
you
both,
take
heart.вЂќ

вЂњWhose?вЂќ
asked
Tyrion
sourly.
He
could
think
of
several
tempting
choices.





DAVOS

Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
wore
no
armor.
He
sat
a
sorrel
stallion,
his
standard-bearer
a
dapple
grey.
Above
them
flapped
BaratheonвЂ™s
crowned
stag
and
the
crossed
quills
of
Penrose,
white
on
a
russet
field.
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
spade-shaped
beard
was
russet
as
well,
though
heвЂ™d
gone
wholly
bald
on
top.
If
the
size
and
splendor
of
the
kingвЂ™s
party
impressed
him,
it
did
not
show
on
that
weathered
face.

They
trotted
up
with
much
clinking
of
chain
and
rattle
of
plate.
Even
Davos
wore
mail,
though
he
could
not
have
said
why;
his
shoulders
and
lower
back
ached
from
the
unaccustomed
weight.
It
made
him
feel
cumbered
and
foolish,
and
he
wondered
once
more
why
he
was
here.
It
is
not
for
me
to
question
the
kingвЂ™s
commands,
and
yetвЂ¦

Every
man
of
the
party
was
of
better
birth
and
higher
station
than
Davos
Seaworth,
and
the
great
lords
glittered
in
the
morning
sun.
Silvered
steel
and
gold
inlay
brightened
their
armor,
and
their
warhelms
were
crested
in
a
riot
of
silken
plumes,
feathers,
and
cunningly
wrought
heraldic
beasts
with
gemstone
eyes.
Stannis
himself
looked
out
of
place
in
this
rich
and
royal
company.
Like
Davos,
the
king
was
plainly
garbed
in
wool
and
boiled
leather,
though
the
circlet
of
red
gold
about
his
temples
lent
him
a
certain
grandeur.
Sunlight
flashed
off
its
flame-shaped
points
whenever
he
moved
his
head.

This
was
the
closest
Davos
had
come
to
His
Grace
in
the
eight
days
since
Black
Betha
had
joined
the
rest
of
the
fleet
off
StormвЂ™s
End.
HeвЂ™d
sought
an
audience
within
an
hour
of
his
arrival,
only
to
be
told
that
the
king
was
occupied.
The
king
was
often
occupied,
Davos
learned
from
his
son
Devan,
one
of
the
royal
squires.
Now
that
Stannis
Baratheon
had
come
into
his
power,
the
lordlings
buzzed
around
him
like
flies
round
a
corpse.
He
looks
half
a
corpse
too,
years
older
than
when
I
left
Dragonstone.
Devan
said
the
king
scarcely
slept
of
late.
вЂњSince
Lord
Renly
died,
he
has
been
troubled
by
terrible
nightmares,вЂќ
the
boy
had
confided
to
his
father.
вЂњMaesterвЂ™s
potions
do
not
touch
them.
Only
the
Lady
Melisandre
can
soothe
him
to
sleep.вЂќ

Is
that
why
she
shares
his
pavilion
now?
Davos
wondered.
To
pray
with
him?
Or
does
she
have
another
way
to
soothe
him
to
sleep?
it
was
an
unworthy
question,
and
one
he
dared
not
ask,
even
of
his
own
son.
Devan
was
a
good
boy,
but
he
wore
the
flaming
heart
proudly
on
his
doublet,
and
his
father
had
seen
him
at
the
nightfires
as
dusk
fell,
beseeching
the
Lord
of
Light
to
bring
the
dawn.
He
is
the
kingвЂ™s
squire,
he
told
himself,
it
is
only
to
be
expected
that
he
would
take
the
kingвЂ™s
god.

Davos
had
almost
forgotten
how
high
and
thick
the
walls
of
StormвЂ™s
End
loomed
up
close.
King
Stannis
halted
beneath
them,
a
few
feet
from
Ser
Cortnay
and
his
standard-bearer.
вЂњSer,вЂќ
he
said
with
stiff
courtesy.
He
made
no
move
to
dismount.

вЂњMy
lord.вЂќ
That
was
less
courteous,
but
not
unexpected.

вЂњIt
is
customary
to
grant
a
king
the
style
Your
Grace,вЂќ
announced
Lord
Florent.
A
red
gold
fox
poked
its
shining
snout
out
from
his
breastplate
through
a
circle
of
lapis
lazuli
flowers.
Very
tall,
very
courtly,
and
very
rich,
the
Lord
of
Brightwater
Keep
had
been
the
first
of
RenlyвЂ™s
bannermen
to
declare
for
Stannis,
and
the
first
to
renounce
his
old
gods
and
take
up
the
Lord
of
Light.
Stannis
had
left
his
queen
on
Dragonstone
along
with
her
uncle
Axell,
but
the
queenвЂ™s
men
were
more
numerous
and
powerful
than
ever,
and
Alester
Florent
was
the
foremost.

Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
ignored
him,
preferring
to
address
Stannis.
вЂњThis
is
a
notable
company.
The
great
lords
Estermont,
Errol,
and
Varner.
Ser
Jon
of
the
green-apple
Fossoways
and
Ser
Bryan
of
the
red.
Lord
Caron
and
Ser
Guyard
of
King
RenlyвЂ™s
Rainbow
GuardвЂ¦
and
the
puissant
Lord
Alester
Florent
of
Brightwater,
to
be
sure.
Is
that
your
Onion
Knight
I
spy
to
the
rear?
Well
met,
Ser
Davos.
I
fear
I
do
not
know
the
lady.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
named
Melisandre,
ser.вЂќ
She
alone
came
unarmored,
but
for
her
flowing
red
robes.
At
her
throat
the
great
ruby
drank
the
daylight.
вЂњI
serve
your
king,
and
the
Lord
of
Light.вЂќ

вЂњI
wish
you
well
of
them,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Cortnay
answered,
вЂњbut
I
bow
to
other
gods,
and
a
different
king.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
but
one
true
king,
and
one
true
god,вЂќ
announced
Lord
Florent.

вЂњAre
we
here
to
dispute
theology,
my
lord?
Had
I
known,
I
would
have
brought
a
septon.вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
full
well
why
we
are
here,вЂќ
said
Stannis.
вЂњYou
have
had
a
fortnight
to
consider
my
offer.
You
sent
your
ravens.
No
help
has
come.
Nor
will
it.
StormвЂ™s
End
stands
alone,
and
I
am
out
of
patience.
One
last
time,
ser,
I
command
you
to
open
your
gates,
and
deliver
me
that
which
is
mine
by
rights.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
terms?вЂќ
asked
Ser
Cortnay.

вЂњRemain
as
before,вЂќ
said
Stannis.
вЂњI
will
pardon
you
for
your
treason,
as
I
have
pardoned
these
lords
you
see
behind
me.
The
men
of
your
garrison
will
be
free
to
enter
my
service
or
to
return
unmolested
to
their
homes.
You
may
keep
your
weapons
and
as
much
property
as
a
man
can
carry.
I
will
require
your
horses
and
pack
animals,
however.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
what
of
Edric
Storm?вЂќ

вЂњMy
brotherвЂ™s
bastard
must
be
surrendered
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњThen
my
answer
is
still
no,
my
lord.вЂќ

The
king
clenched
his
jaw.
He
said
nothing.

Melisandre
spoke
instead.
вЂњMay
the
Lord
of
Light
protect
you
in
your
darkness,
Ser
Cortnay.вЂќ

вЂњMay
the
Others
bugger
your
Lord
of
Light,вЂќ
Penrose
spat
back,
вЂњand
wipe
his
arse
with
that
rag
you
bear.вЂќ

Lord
Alester
Florent
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњSer
Cortnay,
mind
your
tongue.
His
Grace
means
the
boy
no
harm.
The
child
is
his
own
blood,
and
mine
as
well.
My
niece
Delena
was
the
mother,
as
all
men
know.
If
you
will
not
trust
to
the
king,
trust
to
me.
You
know
me
for
a
man
of
honorвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
know
you
for
a
man
of
ambition,вЂќ
Ser
Cortnay
broke
in.
вЂњA
man
who
changes
kings
and
gods
the
way
I
change
my
boots.
As
do
these
other
turncloaks
I
see
before
me.вЂќ

An
angry
clamor
went
up
from
the
kingвЂ™s
men.
He
is
not
far
wrong,
Davos
thought.
Only
a
short
time
before,
the
Fossoways,
Guyard
Morrigen,
and
the
Lords
Caron,
Varner,
Errol,
and
Estermont
had
all
belonged
to
Renly.
They
had
sat
in
his
pavilion,
helped
him
make
his
battle
plans,
plotted
how
Stannis
might
be
brought
low.
And
Lord
Florent
had
been
with
themвЂ”he
might
be
Queen
SelyseвЂ™s
own
uncle,
but
that
had
not
kept
the
Lord
of
Brightwater
from
bending
his
knee
to
Renly
when
RenlyвЂ™s
star
was
rising.

Bryce
Caron
walked
his
horse
forward
a
few
paces,
his
long
rainbow-striped
cloak
twisting
in
the
wind
off
the
bay.
вЂњNo
man
here
is
a
turncloak,
ser.
My
fealty
belongs
to
StormвЂ™s
End,
and
King
Stannis
is
its
rightful
lordвЂ¦
and
our
true
king.
He
is
the
last
of
House
Baratheon,
RobertвЂ™s
heir
and
RenlyвЂ™s.вЂќ

вЂњIf
that
is
so,
why
is
the
Knight
of
Flowers
not
among
you?
And
where
is
Mathis
Rowan?
Randyll
Tarly?
Lady
Oakheart?
Why
are
they
not
here
in
your
company,
they
who
loved
Renly
best?
Where
is
Brienne
of
Tarth,
I
ask
you?вЂќ

вЂњThat
one?вЂќ
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
laughed
harshly.
вЂњShe
ran.
As
well
she
might.
Hers
was
the
hand
that
slew
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњA
lie,вЂќ
Ser
Cortnay
said.
вЂњI
knew
Brienne
when
she
was
no
more
than
a
girl
playing
at
her
fatherвЂ™s
feet
in
Evenfall
Hall,
and
I
knew
her
still
better
when
the
Evenstar
sent
her
here
to
StormвЂ™s
End.
She
loved
Renly
Baratheon
from
the
first
moment
she
laid
eyes
on
him,
a
blind
man
could
see
it.вЂќ

вЂњTo
be
sure,вЂќ
declared
Lord
Florent
airily,
вЂњand
she
would
scarcely
be
the
first
maid
maddened
to
murder
by
a
man
who
spurned
her.
Though
for
my
own
part,
I
believe
it
was
Lady
Stark
who
slew
the
king.
She
had
journeyed
all
the
way
from
Riverrun
to
plead
for
an
alliance,
and
Renly
had
refused
her.
No
doubt
she
saw
him
as
a
danger
to
her
son,
and
so
removed
him.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
Brienne,вЂќ
insisted
Lord
Caron.
вЂњSer
Emmon
Cuy
swore
as
much
before
he
died.
You
have
my
oath
on
that,
Ser
Cortnay.вЂќ

Contempt
thickened
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
voice.
вЂњAnd
what
is
that
worth?
You
wear
your
cloak
of
many
colors,
I
see.
The
one
Renly
gave
you
when
you
swore
your
oath
to
protect
him.
If
he
is
dead,
how
is
it
you
are
not?вЂќ
He
turned
his
scorn
on
Guyard
Morrigen.
вЂњI
might
ask
the
same
of
you,
ser.
Guyard
the
Green,
yes?
Of
the
Rainbow
Guard?
Sworn
to
give
his
own
life
for
his
kingвЂ™s?
if
I
had
such
a
cloak,
I
would
be
ashamed
to
wear
it.вЂќ

Morrigen
bristled.
вЂњBe
glad
this
is
a
parley,
Penrose,
or
I
would
have
your
tongue
for
those
words.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
cast
it
in
the
same
fire
where
you
left
your
manhood?вЂќ

вЂњEnough!вЂќ
Stannis
said.
вЂњThe
Lord
of
Light
willed
that
my
brother
die
for
his
treason.
Who
did
the
deed
matters
not.вЂќ

вЂњNot
to
you,
perhaps,вЂќ
said
Ser
Cortnay.
вЂњI
have
heard
your
proposal,
Lord
Stannis.
Now
here
is
mine.вЂќ
He
pulled
off
his
glove
and
flung
it
full
in
the
kingвЂ™s
face.
вЂњSingle
combat.
Sword,
lance,
or
any
weapon
you
care
to
name.
Or
if
you
fear
to
hazard
your
magic
sword
and
royal
skin
against
an
old
man,
name
you
a
champion,
and
I
shall
do
the
same.вЂќ
He
gave
Guyard
Morrigen
and
Bryce
Caron
a
scathing
look.
вЂњEither
of
these
pups
would
do
nicely,
I
should
think.вЂќ

Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
grew
dark
with
fury.
вЂњI
will
take
up
the
gage,
if
it
please
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњAs
would
I.вЂќ
Bryce
Caron
looked
to
Stannis.

The
king
ground
his
teeth.
вЂњNo.вЂќ

Ser
Cortnay
did
not
seem
surprised.
вЂњIs
it
the
justice
of
your
cause
you
doubt,
my
lord,
or
the
strength
of
your
arm?
Are
you
afraid
IвЂ™ll
piss
on
your
burning
sword
and
put
it
out?вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
take
me
for
an
utter
fool,
ser?вЂќ
asked
Stannis.
вЂњI
have
twenty
thousand
men.
You
are
besieged
by
land
and
sea.
Why
would
I
choose
single
combat
when
my
eventual
victory
is
certain?вЂќ
The
king
pointed
a
finger
at
him.
вЂњI
give
you
fair
warning.
If
you
force
me
to
take
my
castle
by
storm,
you
may
expect
no
mercy.
I
will
hang
you
for
traitors,
every
one
of
you.вЂќ

вЂњAs
the
gods
will
it.
Bring
on
your
storm,
my
lordвЂ”and
recall,
if
you
do,
the
name
of
this
castle.вЂќ
Ser
Cortnay
gave
a
pull
on
his
reins
and
rode
back
toward
the
gate.

Stannis
said
no
word,
but
turned
his
horse
around
and
started
back
toward
his
camp.
The
others
followed.
вЂњIf
we
storm
these
walls
thousands
will
die,вЂќ
fretted
ancient
Lord
Estermont,
who
was
the
kingвЂ™s
grandfather
on
his
motherвЂ™s
side.
вЂњBetter
to
hazard
but
a
single
life,
surely?
Our
cause
is
righteous,
so
the
gods
must
surely
bless
our
championвЂ™s
arms
with
victory.вЂќ

God,
old
man,
thought
Davos.
You
forget,
we
have
only
one
now,
MelisandreвЂ™s
Lord
of
Light.

Ser
Jon
Fossoway
said,
вЂњI
would
gladly
take
this
challenge
myself,
though
IвЂ™m
not
half
the
swordsman
Lord
Caron
is,
or
Ser
Guyard.
Renly
left
no
notable
knights
at
StormвЂ™s
End.
Garrison
duty
is
for
old
men
and
green
boys.вЂќ

Lord
Caron
agreed.
вЂњAn
easy
victory,
to
be
sure.
And
what
glory,
to
win
StormвЂ™s
End
with
a
single
stroke!вЂќ

Stannis
raked
them
all
with
a
look.
вЂњYou
chatter
like
magpies,
and
with
less
sense.
I
will
have
quiet.вЂќ
The
kingвЂ™s
eyes
fell
on
Davos.
вЂњSer.
Ride
with
me.вЂќ
He
spurred
his
horse
away
from
his
followers.
Only
Melisandre
kept
pace,
bearing
the
great
standard
of
the
fiery
heart
with
the
crowned
stag
within.
As
if
it
had
been
swallowed
whole.

Davos
saw
the
looks
that
passed
between
the
lordlings
as
he
rode
past
them
to
join
the
king.
These
were
no
onion
knights,
but
proud
men
from
houses
whose
names
were
old
in
honor.
Somehow
he
knew
that
Renly
had
never
chided
them
in
such
a
fashion.
The
youngest
of
the
Baratheons
had
been
born
with
a
gift
for
easy
courtesy
that
his
brother
sadly
lacked.

He
eased
back
to
a
slow
trot
when
his
horse
came
up
beside
the
kingвЂ™s.
вЂњYour
Grace.вЂќ
Seen
at
close
hand,
Stannis
looked
worse
than
Davos
had
realized
from
afar.
His
face
had
grown
haggard,
and
he
had
dark
circles
under
his
eyes.

вЂњA
smuggler
must
be
a
fair
judge
of
men,вЂќ
the
king
said.
вЂњWhat
do
you
make
of
this
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose?вЂќ

вЂњA
stubborn
man,вЂќ
said
Davos
carefully.

вЂњHungry
for
death,
I
call
it.
He
throws
my
pardon
in
my
face.
Aye,
and
throws
his
life
away
in
the
bargain,
and
the
lives
of
every
man
inside
those
walls.
Single
combat?вЂќ
The
king
snorted
in
derision.
вЂњNo
doubt
he
mistook
me
for
Robert.вЂќ

вЂњMore
like
he
was
desperate.
What
other
hope
does
he
have?вЂќ

вЂњNone.
The
castle
will
fall.
But
how
to
do
it
quickly?вЂќ
Stannis
brooded
on
that
for
a
moment.
Under
the
steady
clop-clop
of
hooves,
Davos
could
hear
the
faint
sound
of
the
king
grinding
his
teeth.
вЂњLord
Alester
urges
me
to
bring
old
Lord
Penrose
here.
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
father.
You
know
the
man,
I
believe?вЂќ

вЂњWhen
I
came
as
your
envoy,
Lord
Penrose
received
me
more
courteously
than
most,вЂќ
Davos
said.
вЂњHe
is
an
old
done
man,
sire.
Sickly
and
failing.вЂќ

вЂњFlorent
would
have
him
fail
more
visibly.
In
his
sonвЂ™s
sight,
with
a
noose
about
his
neck.вЂќ

It
was
dangerous
to
oppose
the
queenвЂ™s
men,
but
Davos
had
vowed
always
to
tell
his
king
the
truth.
вЂњI
think
that
would
be
ill
done,
my
liege.
Ser
Cortnay
will
watch
his
father
die
before
he
would
ever
betray
his
trust.
It
would
gain
us
nothing,
and
bring
dishonor
to
our
cause.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
dishonor?вЂќ
Stannis
bristled.
вЂњWould
you
have
me
spare
the
lives
of
traitors?вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
spared
the
lives
of
those
behind
us.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
scold
me
for
that,
smuggler?вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
not
my
place.вЂќ
Davos
feared
he
had
said
too
much.

The
king
was
relentless.
вЂњYou
esteem
this
Penrose
more
than
you
do
my
lords
bannermen.
Why?вЂќ

вЂњHe
keeps
faith.вЂќ

вЂњA
misplaced
faith
in
a
dead
usurper.вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Davos
admitted,
вЂњbut
still,
he
keeps
faith.вЂќ

вЂњAs
those
behind
us
do
not?вЂќ

Davos
had
come
too
far
with
Stannis
to
play
coy
now.
вЂњLast
year
they
were
RobertвЂ™s
men.
A
moon
ago
they
were
RenlyвЂ™s.
This
morning
they
are
yours.
Whose
will
they
be
on
the
morrow?вЂќ

And
Stannis
laughed.
A
sudden
gust,
rough
and
full
of
scorn.
вЂњI
told
you,
Melisandre,вЂќ
he
said
to
the
red
woman,
вЂњmy
Onion
Knight
tells
me
the
truth.вЂќ

вЂњI
see
you
know
him
well,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
the
red
woman
said.

вЂњDavos,
I
have
missed
you
sorely,вЂќ
the
king
said.
вЂњAye,
I
have
a
tail
of
traitors,
your
nose
does
not
deceive
you.
My
lords
bannermen
are
inconstant
even
in
their
treasons.
I
need
them,
but
you
should
know
how
it
sickens
me
to
pardon
such
as
these
when
I
have
punished
better
men
for
lesser
crimes.
You
have
every
right
to
reproach
me,
Ser
Davos.вЂќ

вЂњYou
reproach
yourself
more
than
I
ever
could,
Your
Grace.
You
must
have
these
great
lords
to
win
your
throneвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњFingers
and
all,
it
seems.вЂќ
Stannis
smiled
grimly.

Unthinking,
Davos
raised
his
maimed
hand
to
the
pouch
at
his
throat,
and
felt
the
fingerbones
within.
Luck.

The
king
saw
the
motion.
вЂњAre
they
still
there,
Onion
Knight?
You
have
not
lost
them?вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
do
you
keep
them?
I
have
often
wondered.вЂќ

вЂњThey
remind
me
of
what
I
was.
Where
I
came
from.
They
remind
me
of
your
justice,
my
liege.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
justice,вЂќ
Stannis
said.
вЂњA
good
act
does
not
wash
out
the
bad,
nor
a
bad
act
the
good.
Each
should
have
its
own
reward.
You
were
a
hero
and
a
smuggler.вЂќ
He
glanced
behind
at
Lord
Florent
and
the
others,
rainbow
knights
and
turncloaks,
who
were
following
at
a
distance.
вЂњThese
pardoned
lords
would
do
well
to
reflect
on
that.
Good
men
and
true
will
fight
for
Joffrey,
wrongly
believing
him
the
true
king.
A
northman
might
even
say
the
same
of
Robb
Stark.
But
these
lords
who
flocked
to
my
brotherвЂ™s
banners
knew
him
for
a
usurper.
They
turned
their
backs
on
their
rightful
king
for
no
better
reason
than
dreams
of
power
and
glory,
and
I
have
marked
them
for
what
they
are.
Pardoned
them,
yes.
Forgiven.
But
not
forgotten.вЂќ
He
fell
silent
for
a
moment,
brooding
on
his
plans
for
justice.
And
then,
abruptly,
he
said,
вЂњWhat
do
the
smallfolk
say
of
RenlyвЂ™s
death?вЂќ

вЂњThey
grieve.
Your
brother
was
well
loved.вЂќ

вЂњFools
love
a
fool,вЂќ
grumbled
Stannis,
вЂњbut
I
grieve
for
him
as
well.
For
the
boy
he
was,
not
the
man
he
grew
to
be.вЂќ
He
was
silent
for
a
time,
and
then
he
said,
вЂњHow
did
the
commons
take
the
news
of
CerseiвЂ™s
incest?вЂќ

вЂњWhile
we
were
among
them
they
shouted
for
King
Stannis.
I
cannot
speak
for
what
they
said
once
we
had
sailed.вЂќ

вЂњSo
you
do
not
think
they
believed?вЂќ

вЂњWhen
I
was
smuggling,
I
learned
that
some
men
believe
everything
and
some
nothing.
We
met
both
sorts.
And
there
is
another
tale
being
spread
as
wellвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
Stannis
bit
off
the
word.
вЂњSelyse
has
given
me
horns,
and
tied
a
foolвЂ™s
bells
to
the
end
of
each.
My
daughter
fathered
by
a
halfwit
jester!
A
tale
as
vile
as
it
is
absurd.
Renly
threw
it
in
my
teeth
when
we
met
to
parley.
You
would
need
to
be
as
mad
as
Patchface
to
believe
such
a
thing.вЂќ

вЂњThat
may
be
so,
my
liegeвЂ¦
but
whether
they
believe
the
story
or
no,
they
delight
to
tell
it.вЂќ
In
many
places
it
had
come
before
them,
poisoning
the
well
for
their
own
true
tale.

вЂњRobert
could
piss
in
a
cup
and
men
would
call
it
wine,
but
I
offer
them
pure
cold
water
and
they
squint
in
suspicion
and
mutter
to
each
other
about
how
queer
it
tastes.вЂќ
Stannis
ground
his
teeth.
вЂњIf
someone
said
I
had
magicked
myself
into
a
boar
to
kill
Robert,
likely
they
would
believe
that
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњYou
cannot
stop
them
talking,
my
liege,вЂќ
Davos
said,
вЂњbut
when
you
take
your
vengeance
on
your
brothersвЂ™
true
killers,
the
realm
will
know
such
tales
for
lies.вЂќ

Stannis
only
seemed
to
half
hear
him.
вЂњI
have
no
doubt
that
Cersei
had
a
hand
in
RobertвЂ™s
death.
I
will
have
justice
for
him.
Aye,
and
for
Ned
Stark
and
Jon
Arryn
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
for
Renly?вЂќ
The
words
were
out
before
Davos
could
stop
to
consider
them.

For
a
long
time
the
king
did
not
speak.
Then,
very
softly,
he
said,
вЂњI
dream
of
it
sometimes.
Of
RenlyвЂ™s
dying.
A
green
tent,
candles,
a
woman
screaming.
And
blood.вЂќ
Stannis
looked
down
at
his
hands.
вЂњI
was
still
abed
when
he
died.
Your
Devan
will
tell
you.
He
tried
to
wake
me.
Dawn
was
nigh
and
my
lords
were
waiting,
fretting.
I
should
have
been
ahorse,
armored.
I
knew
Renly
would
attack
at
break
of
day.
Devan
says
I
thrashed
and
cried
out,
but
what
does
it
matter?
It
was
a
dream.
I
was
in
my
tent
when
Renly
died,
and
when
I
woke
my
hands
were
clean.вЂќ

Ser
Davos
Seaworth
could
feel
his
phantom
fingertips
start
to
itch.
Something
is
wrong
here,
the
onetime
smuggler
thought.
Yet
he
nodded
and
said,
вЂњI
see.вЂќ

вЂњRenly
offered
me
a
peach.
At
our
parley.
Mocked
me,
defied
me,
threatened
me,
and
offered
me
a
peach.
I
thought
he
was
drawing
a
blade
and
went
for
mine
own.
Was
that
his
purpose,
to
make
me
show
fear?
Or
was
it
one
of
his
pointless
jests?
When
he
spoke
of
how
sweet
the
peach
was,
did
his
words
have
some
hidden
meaning?вЂќ
The
king
gave
a
shake
of
his
head,
like
a
dog
shaking
a
rabbit
to
snap
its
neck.
вЂњOnly
Renly
could
vex
me
so
with
a
piece
of
fruit.
He
brought
his
doom
on
himself
with
his
treason,
but
I
did
love
him,
Davos.
I
know
that
now.
I
swear,
I
will
go
to
my
grave
thinking
of
my
brotherвЂ™s
peach.вЂќ

By
then
they
were
in
amongst
the
camp,
riding
past
the
ordered
rows
of
tents,
the
blowing
banners,
and
the
stacks
of
shields
and
spears.
The
stink
of
horse
dung
was
heavy
in
the
air,
mingled
with
the
woodsmoke
and
the
smell
of
cooking
meat.
Stannis
reined
up
long
enough
to
bark
a
brusque
dismissal
to
Lord
Florent
and
the
others,
commanding
them
to
attend
him
in
his
pavilion
one
hour
hence
for
a
council
of
war.
They
bowed
their
heads
and
dispersed,
while
Davos
and
Melisandre
rode
to
the
kingвЂ™s
pavilion.

The
tent
had
to
be
large,
since
it
was
there
his
lords
bannermen
came
to
council.
Yet
there
was
nothing
grand
about
it.
It
was
a
soldierвЂ™s
tent
of
heavy
canvas,
dyed
the
dark
yellow
that
sometimes
passed
for
gold.
Only
the
royal
banner
that
streamed
atop
the
center
pole
marked
it
as
a
kingвЂ™s.
That,
and
the
guards
without;
queenвЂ™s
men
leaning
on
tall
spears,
with
the
badge
of
the
fiery
heart
sewn
over
their
own.

Grooms
came
up
to
help
them
dismount.
One
of
the
guards
relieved
Melisandre
of
her
cumbersome
standard,
driving
the
staff
deep
into
the
soft
ground.
Devan
stood
to
one
side
of
the
door,
waiting
to
lift
the
flap
for
the
king.
An
older
squire
waited
beside
him.
Stannis
took
off
his
crown
and
handed
it
to
Devan.
вЂњCold
water,
cups
for
two.
Davos,
attend
me.
My
lady,
I
shall
send
for
you
when
I
require
you.вЂќ

вЂњAs
the
king
commands.вЂќ
Melisandre
bowed.

After
the
brightness
of
the
morning,
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
seemed
cool
and
dim.
Stannis
seated
himself
on
a
plain
wooden
camp
stool
and
waved
Davos
to
another.
вЂњOne
day
I
may
make
you
a
lord,
smuggler.
If
only
to
irk
Celtigar
and
Florent.
You
will
not
thank
me,
though.
It
will
mean
you
must
suffer
through
these
councils,
and
feign
interest
in
the
braying
of
mules.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
do
you
have
them,
if
they
serve
no
purpose?вЂќ

вЂњThe
mules
love
the
sound
of
their
own
braying,
why
else?
And
I
need
them
to
haul
my
cart.
Oh,
to
be
sure,
once
in
a
great
while
some
useful
notion
is
put
forth.
But
not
today,
I
thinkвЂ”ah,
hereвЂ™s
your
son
with
our
water.вЂќ

Devan
set
the
tray
on
the
table
and
filled
two
clay
cups.
The
king
sprinkled
a
pinch
of
salt
in
his
cup
before
he
drank;
Davos
took
his
water
straight,
wishing
it
were
wine.
вЂњYou
were
speaking
of
your
council?вЂќ

вЂњLet
me
tell
you
how
it
will
go.
Lord
Velaryon
will
urge
me
to
storm
the
castle
walls
at
first
light,
grapnels
and
scaling
ladders
against
arrows
and
boiling
oil.
The
young
mules
will
think
this
a
splendid
notion.
Estermont
will
favor
settling
down
to
starve
them
out,
as
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
once
tried
with
me.
That
might
take
a
year,
but
old
mules
are
patient.
And
Lord
Caron
and
the
others
who
like
to
kick
will
want
to
take
up
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
gauntlet
and
hazard
all
upon
a
single
combat.
Each
one
imagining
he
will
be
my
champion
and
win
undying
fame.вЂќ
The
king
finished
his
water.
вЂњWhat
would
you
have
me
do,
smuggler?вЂќ

Davos
considered
a
moment
before
he
answered.
вЂњStrike
for
KingвЂ™s
Landing
at
once.вЂќ

The
king
snorted.
вЂњAnd
leave
StormвЂ™s
End
untaken?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Cortnay
does
not
have
the
power
to
harm
you.
The
Lannisters
do.
A
siege
would
take
too
long,
single
combat
is
too
chancy,
and
an
assault
would
cost
thousands
of
lives
with
no
certainty
of
success.
And
there
is
no
need.
Once
you
dethrone
Joffrey
this
castle
must
come
to
you
with
all
the
rest.
It
is
said
about
the
camp
that
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
rushes
west
to
rescue
Lannisport
from
the
vengeance
of
the
northmenвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
a
passing
clever
father,
Devan,вЂќ
the
king
told
the
boy
standing
by
his
elbow.
вЂњHe
makes
me
wish
I
had
more
smugglers
in
my
service.
And
fewer
lords.
Though
you
are
wrong
in
one
respect,
Davos.
There
is
a
need.
If
I
leave
StormвЂ™s
End
untaken
in
my
rear,
it
will
be
said
I
was
defeated
here.
And
that
I
cannot
permit.
Men
do
not
love
me
as
they
loved
my
brothers.
They
follow
me
because
they
fear
meвЂ¦
and
defeat
is
death
to
fear.
The
castle
must
fall.вЂќ
His
jaw
ground
side
to
side.
вЂњAye,
and
quickly.
Doran
Martell
has
called
his
banners
and
fortified
the
mountain
passes.
His
Dornishmen
are
poised
to
sweep
down
onto
the
Marches.
And
Highgarden
is
far
from
spent.
My
brother
left
the
greater
part
of
his
power
at
Bitterbridge,
near
sixty
thousand
foot.
I
sent
my
wifeвЂ™s
brother
Ser
Errol
with
Ser
Parmen
Crane
to
take
them
under
my
command,
but
they
have
not
returned.
I
fear
that
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
reached
Bitterbridge
before
my
envoys,
and
took
that
host
for
his
own.вЂќ

вЂњAll
the
more
reason
to
take
KingвЂ™s
Landing
as
soon
as
we
may.
Salladhor
Saan
told
meвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSalladhor
Saan
thinks
only
of
gold!вЂќ
Stannis
exploded.
вЂњHis
head
is
full
of
dreams
of
the
treasure
he
fancies
lies
under
the
Red
Keep,
so
let
us
hear
no
more
of
Salladhor
Saan.
The
day
I
need
military
counsel
from
a
Lysene
brigand
is
the
day
I
put
off
my
crown
and
take
the
black.вЂќ
The
king
made
a
fist.
вЂњAre
you
here
to
serve
me,
smuggler?
Or
to
vex
me
with
arguments?вЂќ

вЂњI
am
yours,вЂќ
Davos
said.

вЂњThen
hear
me.
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
lieutenant
is
cousin
to
the
Fossoways.
Lord
Meadows,
a
green
boy
of
twenty.
Should
some
ill
chance
strike
down
Penrose,
command
of
StormвЂ™s
End
would
pass
to
this
stripling,
and
his
cousins
believe
he
would
accept
my
terms
and
yield
up
the
castle.вЂќ

вЂњI
remember
another
stripling
who
was
given
command
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
He
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
twenty.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Meadows
is
not
as
stonehead
stubborn
as
I
was.вЂќ

вЂњStubborn
or
craven,
what
does
it
matter?
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
seemed
hale
and
hearty
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњSo
did
my
brother,
the
day
before
his
death.
The
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors,
Davos.вЂќ

Davos
Seaworth
felt
the
small
hairs
rising
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
вЂњMy
lord,
I
do
not
understand
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
require
your
understanding.
Only
your
service.
Ser
Cortnay
will
be
dead
within
the
day.
Melisandre
has
seen
it
in
the
flames
of
the
future.
His
death
and
the
manner
of
it.
He
will
not
die
in
knightly
combat,
needless
to
say.вЂќ
Stannis
held
out
his
cup,
and
Devan
filled
it
again
from
the
flagon.
вЂњHer
flames
do
not
lie.
She
saw
RenlyвЂ™s
doom
as
well.
On
Dragonstone
she
saw
it,
and
told
Selyse.
Lord
Velaryon
and
your
friend
Salladhor
Saan
would
have
had
me
sail
against
Joffrey,
but
Melisandre
told
me
that
if
I
went
to
StormвЂ™s
End,
I
would
win
the
best
part
of
my
brotherвЂ™s
power,
and
she
was
right.вЂќ

вЂњB-but,вЂќ
Davos
stammered,
вЂњLord
Renly
only
came
here
because
you
had
laid
siege
to
the
castle.
He
was
marching
toward
KingвЂ™s
Landing
before,
against
the
Lannisters,
he
would
haveвЂ”вЂќ

Stannis
shifted
in
his
seat,
frowning.
вЂњWas,
would
have,
what
is
that?
He
did
what
he
did.
He
came
here
with
his
banners
and
his
peaches,
to
his
doomвЂ¦
and
it
was
well
for
me
he
did.
Melisandre
saw
another
day
in
her
flames
as
well.
A
morrow
where
Renly
rode
out
of
the
south
in
his
green
armor
to
smash
my
host
beneath
the
walls
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
Had
I
met
my
brother
there,
it
might
have
been
me
who
died
in
place
of
him.вЂќ

вЂњOr
you
might
have
joined
your
strength
to
his
to
bring
down
the
Lannisters,вЂќ
Davos
protested.
вЂњWhy
not
that?
If
she
saw
two
futures,
wellвЂ¦
both
cannot
be
true.вЂќ

King
Stannis
pointed
a
finger.
вЂњThere
you
err,
Onion
Knight.
Some
lights
cast
more
than
one
shadow.
Stand
before
the
nightfire
and
youвЂ™ll
see
for
yourself.
The
flames
shift
and
dance,
never
still.
The
shadows
grow
tall
and
short,
and
every
man
casts
a
dozen.
Some
are
fainter
than
others,
thatвЂ™s
all.
Well,
men
cast
their
shadows
across
the
future
as
well.
One
shadow
or
many.
Melisandre
sees
them
all.

вЂњYou
do
not
love
the
woman.
I
know
that,
Davos,
I
am
not
blind.
My
lords
mislike
her
too.
Estermont
thinks
the
flaming
heart
ill-chosen
and
begs
to
fight
beneath
the
crowned
stag
as
of
old.
Ser
Guyard
says
a
woman
should
not
be
my
standard-bearer.
Others
whisper
that
she
has
no
place
in
my
war
councils,
that
I
ought
to
send
her
back
to
Asshai,
that
it
is
sinful
to
keep
her
in
my
tent
of
a
night.
Aye,
they
whisperвЂ¦
while
she
serves.вЂќ

вЂњServes
how?вЂќ
Davos
asked,
dreading
the
answer.

вЂњAs
needed.вЂќ
The
king
looked
at
him.
вЂњAnd
you?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦вЂќ
Davos
licked
his
lips.
вЂњI
am
yours
to
command.
What
would
you
have
me
do?вЂќ

вЂњNothing
you
have
not
done
before.
Only
land
a
boat
beneath
the
castle,
unseen,
in
the
black
of
night.
Can
you
do
that?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
Tonight?вЂќ

The
king
gave
a
curt
nod.
вЂњYou
will
need
a
small
boat.
Not
Black
Betha.
No
one
must
know
what
you
do.вЂќ

Davos
wanted
to
protest.
He
was
a
knight
now,
no
longer
a
smuggler,
and
he
had
never
been
an
assassin.
Yet
when
he
opened
his
mouth,
the
words
would
not
come.
This
was
Stannis,
his
just
lord,
to
whom
he
owed
all
he
was.
And
he
had
his
sons
to
consider
as
well.
Gods
be
good,
what
has
she
done
to
him?

вЂњYou
are
quiet,вЂќ
Stannis
observed.

And
should
remain
so,
Davos
told
himself,
yet
instead
he
said,
вЂњMy
liege,
you
must
have
the
castle,
I
see
that
now,
but
surely
there
are
other
ways.
Cleaner
ways.
Let
Ser
Cortnay
keep
the
bastard
boy
and
he
may
well
yield.вЂќ

вЂњI
must
have
the
boy,
Davos.
Must.
Melisandre
has
seen
that
in
the
flames
as
well.вЂќ

Davos
groped
for
some
other
answer.
вЂњStormвЂ™s
End
holds
no
knight
who
can
match
Ser
Guyard
or
Lord
Caron,
or
any
of
a
hundred
others
sworn
to
your
service.
This
single
combatвЂ¦
could
it
be
that
Ser
Cortnay
seeks
for
a
way
to
yield
with
honor?
Even
if
it
means
his
own
life?вЂќ

A
troubled
look
crossed
the
kingвЂ™s
face
like
a
passing
cloud.
вЂњMore
like
he
plans
some
treachery.
There
will
be
no
combat
of
champions.
Ser
Cortnay
was
dead
before
he
ever
threw
that
glove.
The
flames
do
not
lie,
Davos.вЂќ

Yet
they
require
me
to
make
them
true,
he
thought.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
Davos
Seaworth
felt
so
sad.

And
so
it
was
that
he
found
himself
once
more
crossing
Shipbreaker
Bay
in
the
dark
of
night,
steering
a
tiny
boat
with
a
black
sail.
The
sky
was
the
same,
and
the
sea.
The
same
salt
smell
was
in
the
air,
and
the
water
chuckling
against
the
hull
was
just
as
he
remembered
it.
A
thousand
flickering
campfires
burned
around
the
castle,
as
the
fires
of
the
Tyrells
and
Redwynes
had
sixteen
years
before.
But
all
the
rest
was
different.

The
last
time
it
was
life
I
brought
to
StormвЂ™s
End,
shaped
to
look
like
onions.
This
time
it
is
death,
in
the
shape
of
Melisandre
of
Asshai.
Sixteen
years
ago,
the
sails
had
cracked
and
snapped
with
every
shift
of
wind,
until
heвЂ™d
pulled
them
down
and
gone
on
with
muffled
oars.
Even
so,
his
heart
had
been
in
his
gullet.
The
men
on
the
Redwyne
galleys
had
grown
lax
after
so
long,
however,
and
they
had
slipped
through
the
cordon
smooth
as
black
satin.
This
time,
the
only
ships
in
sight
belonged
to
Stannis,
and
the
only
danger
would
come
from
watchers
on
the
castle
walls.
Even
so,
Davos
was
taut
as
a
bowstring.

Melisandre
huddled
upon
a
thwart,
lost
in
the
folds
of
a
dark
red
cloak
that
covered
her
from
head
to
heels,
her
face
a
paleness
beneath
the
cowl.
Davos
loved
the
water.
He
slept
best
when
he
had
a
deck
rocking
beneath
him,
and
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
his
rigging
was
a
sweeter
sound
to
him
than
any
a
singer
could
make
with
his
harp
strings.
Even
the
sea
brought
him
no
comfort
tonight,
though.
вЂњI
can
smell
the
fear
on
you,
ser
knight,вЂќ
the
red
woman
said
softly.

вЂњSomeone
once
told
me
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.
And
tonight
I
am
no
knight.
Tonight
I
am
Davos
the
smuggler
again.
Would
that
you
were
an
onion.вЂќ

She
laughed.
вЂњIs
it
me
you
fear?
Or
what
we
do?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
you
do.
IвЂ™ll
have
no
part
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњYour
hand
raised
the
sail.
Your
hand
holds
the
tiller.вЂќ

Silent,
Davos
tended
to
his
course.
The
shore
was
a
snarl
of
rocks,
so
he
was
taking
them
well
out
across
the
bay.
He
would
wait
for
the
tide
to
turn
before
coming
about.
StormвЂ™s
End
dwindled
behind
them,
but
the
red
woman
seemed
unconcerned.
вЂњAre
you
a
good
man,
Davos
Seaworth?вЂќ
she
asked.

Would
a
good
man
be
doing
this?
вЂњI
am
a
man,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
am
kind
to
my
wife,
but
I
have
known
other
women.
I
have
tried
to
be
a
father
to
my
sons,
to
help
make
them
a
place
in
this
world.
Aye,
IвЂ™ve
broken
laws,
but
I
never
felt
evil
until
tonight.
I
would
say
my
parts
are
mixed,
mвЂ™lady.
Good
and
bad.вЂќ

вЂњA
grey
man,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњNeither
white
nor
black,
but
partaking
of
both.
Is
that
what
you
are,
Ser
Davos?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
if
I
am?
It
seems
to
me
that
most
men
are
grey.вЂќ

вЂњIf
half
of
an
onion
is
black
with
rot,
it
is
a
rotten
onion.
A
man
is
good,
or
he
is
evil.вЂќ

The
fires
behind
them
had
melted
into
one
vague
glow
against
the
black
sky,
and
the
land
was
almost
out
of
sight.
It
was
time
to
come
about.
вЂњWatch
your
head,
my
lady.вЂќ
He
pushed
on
the
tiller,
and
the
small
boat
threw
up
a
curl
of
black
water
as
she
turned.
Melisandre
leaned
under
the
swinging
yard,
one
hand
on
the
gunwale,
calm
as
ever.
Wood
creaked,
canvas
cracked,
and
water
splashed,
so
loudly
a
man
might
swear
the
castle
was
sure
to
hear.
Davos
knew
better.
The
endless
crash
of
wave
on
rock
was
the
only
sound
that
ever
penetrated
the
massive
seaward
walls
of
StormвЂ™s
End,
and
that
but
faintly.

A
rippling
wake
spread
out
behind
as
they
swung
back
toward
the
shore.
вЂњYou
speak
of
men
and
onions,вЂќ
Davos
said
to
Melisandre.
вЂњWhat
of
women?
Is
it
not
the
same
for
them?
Are
you
good
or
evil,
my
lady?вЂќ

That
made
her
chuckle.
вЂњOh,
good.
I
am
a
knight
of
sorts
myself,
sweet
ser.
A
champion
of
light
and
life.вЂќ

вЂњYet
you
mean
to
kill
a
man
tonight,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњAs
you
killed
Maester
Cressen.вЂќ

вЂњYour
maester
poisoned
himself.
He
meant
to
poison
me,
but
I
was
protected
by
a
greater
power
and
he
was
not.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Renly
Baratheon?
Who
was
it
who
killed
him?вЂќ

Her
head
turned.
Beneath
the
shadow
of
the
cowl,
her
eyes
burned
like
pale
red
candle
flames.
вЂњNot
I.вЂќ

вЂњLiar.вЂќ
Davos
was
certain
now.

Melisandre
laughed
again.
вЂњYou
are
lost
in
darkness
and
confusion,
Ser
Davos.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
good
thing.вЂќ
Davos
gestured
at
the
distant
lights
flickering
along
the
walls
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
вЂњFeel
how
cold
the
wind
is?
The
guards
will
huddle
close
to
those
torches.
A
little
warmth,
a
little
light,
theyвЂ™re
a
comfort
on
a
night
like
this.
Yet
that
will
blind
them,
so
they
will
not
see
us
pass.вЂќ
I
hope.
вЂњThe
god
of
darkness
protects
us
now,
my
lady.
Even
you.вЂќ

The
flames
of
her
eyes
seemed
to
burn
a
little
brighter
at
that.
вЂњSpeak
not
that
name,
ser.
Lest
you
draw
his
black
eye
upon
us.
He
protects
no
man,
I
promise
you.
He
is
the
enemy
of
all
that
lives.
It
is
the
torches
that
hide
us,
you
have
said
so
yourself.
Fire.
The
bright
gift
of
the
Lord
of
Light.вЂќ

вЂњHave
it
your
way.вЂќ

вЂњHis
way,
rather.вЂќ

The
wind
was
shifting,
Davos
could
feel
it,
see
it
in
the
way
the
black
canvas
rippled.
He
reached
for
the
halyards.
вЂњHelp
me
bring
in
the
sail.
IвЂ™ll
row
us
the
rest
of
the
way.вЂќ

Together
they
tied
off
the
sail
as
the
boat
rocked
beneath
them.
As
Davos
unshipped
the
oars
and
slid
them
into
the
choppy
black
water,
he
said,
вЂњWho
rowed
you
to
Renly?вЂќ

вЂњThere
was
no
need,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњHe
was
unprotected.
But
hereвЂ¦
this
StormвЂ™s
End
is
an
old
place.
There
are
spells
woven
into
the
stones.
Dark
walls
that
no
shadow
can
passвЂ”ancient,
forgotten,
yet
still
in
place.вЂќ

вЂњShadow?вЂќ
Davos
felt
his
flesh
prickling.
вЂњA
shadow
is
a
thing
of
darkness.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
more
ignorant
than
a
child,
ser
knight.
There
are
no
shadows
in
the
dark.
Shadows
are
the
servants
of
light,
the
children
of
fire.
The
brightest
flame
casts
the
darkest
shadows.вЂќ

Frowning,
Davos
hushed
her
then.
They
were
coming
close
to
shore
once
more,
and
voices
carried
across
the
water.
He
rowed,
the
faint
sound
of
his
oars
lost
in
the
rhythm
of
the
waves.
The
seaward
side
of
StormвЂ™s
End
perched
upon
a
pale
white
cliff,
the
chalky
stone
sloping
up
steeply
to
half
again
the
height
of
the
massive
curtain
wall.
A
mouth
yawned
in
the
cliff,
and
it
was
that
Davos
steered
for,
as
he
had
sixteen
years
before.
The
tunnel
opened
on
a
cavern
under
the
castle,
where
the
storm
lords
of
old
had
built
their
landing.

The
passage
was
navigable
only
during
high
tide,
and
was
never
less
than
treacherous,
but
his
smugglerвЂ™s
skills
had
not
deserted
him.
Davos
threaded
their
way
deftly
between
the
jagged
rocks
until
the
cave
mouth
loomed
up
before
them.
He
let
the
waves
carry
them
inside.
They
crashed
around
him,
slamming
the
boat
this
way
and
that
and
soaking
them
to
the
skin.
A
half-seen
finger
of
rock
came
rushing
up
out
of
the
gloom,
snarling
foam,
and
Davos
barely
kept
them
off
it
with
an
oar.

Then
they
were
past,
engulfed
in
darkness,
and
the
waters
smoothed.

The
little
boat
slowed
and
swirled.
The
sound
of
their
breathing
echoed
until
it
seemed
to
surround
them.
Davos
had
not
expected
the
blackness.
The
last
time,
torches
had
burned
all
along
the
tunnel,
and
the
eyes
of
starving
men
had
peered
down
through
the
murder
holes
in
the
ceiling.
The
portcullis
was
somewhere
ahead,
he
knew.
Davos
used
the
oars
to
slow
them,
and
they
drifted
against
it
almost
gently.

вЂњThis
is
as
far
as
we
go,
unless
you
have
a
man
inside
to
lift
the
gate
for
us.вЂќ
His
whispers
scurried
across
the
lapping
water
like
a
line
of
mice
on
soft
pink
feet.

вЂњHave
we
passed
within
the
walls?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
Beneath.
But
we
can
go
no
farther.
The
portcullis
goes
all
the
way
to
the
bottom.
And
the
bars
are
too
closely
spaced
for
even
a
child
to
squeeze
through.вЂќ

There
was
no
answer
but
a
soft
rustling.
And
then
a
light
bloomed
amidst
the
darkness.

Davos
raised
a
hand
to
shield
his
eyes,
and
his
breath
caught
in
his
throat.
Melisandre
had
thrown
back
her
cowl
and
shrugged
out
of
the
smothering
robe.
Beneath,
she
was
naked,
and
huge
with
child.
Swollen
breasts
hung
heavy
against
her
chest,
and
her
belly
bulged
as
if
near
to
bursting.
вЂњGods
preserve
us,вЂќ
he
whispered,
and
heard
her
answering
laugh,
deep
and
throaty.
Her
eyes
were
hot
coals,
and
the
sweat
that
dappled
her
skin
seemed
to
glow
with
a
light
of
its
own.
Melisandre
shone.

Panting,
she
squatted
and
spread
her
legs.
Blood
ran
down
her
thighs,
black
as
ink.
Her
cry
might
have
been
agony
or
ecstasy
or
both.
And
Davos
saw
the
crown
of
the
childвЂ™s
head
push
its
way
out
of
her.
Two
arms
wriggled
free,
grasping,
black
fingers
coiling
around
MelisandreвЂ™s
straining
thighs,
pushing,
until
the
whole
of
the
shadow
slid
out
into
the
world
and
rose
taller
than
Davos,
tall
as
the
tunnel,
towering
above
the
boat.
He
had
only
an
instant
to
look
at
it
before
it
was
gone,
twisting
between
the
bars
of
the
portcullis
and
racing
across
the
surface
of
the
water,
but
that
instant
was
long
enough.

He
knew
that
shadow.
As
he
knew
the
man
whoвЂ™d
cast
it.





JON

The
call
came
drifting
through
the
black
of
night.
Jon
pushed
himself
onto
an
elbow,
his
hand
reaching
for
Longclaw
by
force
of
habit
as
the
camp
began
to
stir.
The
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
he
thought.

The
long
low
note
lingered
at
the
edge
of
hearing.
The
sentries
at
the
ringwall
stood
still
in
their
footsteps,
breath
frosting
and
heads
turned
toward
the
west.
As
the
sound
of
the
horn
faded,
even
the
wind
ceased
to
blow.
Men
rolled
from
their
blankets
and
reached
for
spears
and
swordbelts,
moving
quietly,
listening.
A
horse
whickered
and
was
hushed.
For
a
heartbeat
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
forest
were
holding
its
breath.
The
brothers
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
waited
for
a
second
blast,
praying
they
should
not
hear
it,
fearing
that
they
would.

When
the
silence
had
stretched
unbearably
long
and
the
men
knew
at
last
that
the
horn
would
not
wind
again,
they
grinned
at
one
another
sheepishly,
as
if
to
deny
that
they
had
been
anxious.
Jon
Snow
fed
a
few
sticks
to
the
fire,
buckled
on
his
swordbelt,
pulled
on
his
boots,
shook
the
dirt
and
dew
from
the
cloak,
and
fastened
it
around
his
shoulders.
The
flames
blazed
up
beside
him,
welcome
heat
beating
against
his
face
as
he
dressed.
He
could
hear
the
Lord
Commander
moving
inside
the
tent.
After
a
moment
Mormont
lifted
the
flap.
вЂњOne
blast?вЂќ
On
his
shoulder,
his
raven
sat
fluffed
and
silent,
looking
miserable.

вЂњOne,
my
lord,вЂќ
Jon
agreed.
вЂњBrothers
returning.вЂќ

Mormont
moved
to
the
fire.
вЂњThe
Halfhand.
And
past
time.вЂќ
He
had
grown
more
restive
every
day
they
waited;
much
longer
and
he
would
have
been
fit
to
whelp
cubs.
вЂњSee
that
thereвЂ™s
hot
food
for
the
men
and
fodder
for
the
horses.
IвЂ™ll
see
Qhorin
at
once.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
bring
him,
my
lord.вЂќ
The
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower
had
been
expected
days
ago.
When
they
had
not
appeared,
the
brothers
had
begun
to
wonder.
Jon
had
heard
gloomy
mutterings
around
the
cookfire,
and
not
just
from
Dolorous
Edd.
Ser
Ottyn
Wythers
was
for
retreating
to
Castle
Black
as
soon
as
possible.
Ser
Mallador
Locke
would
strike
for
the
Shadow
Tower,
hoping
to
pick
up
QhorinвЂ™s
trail
and
learn
what
had
befallen
him.
And
Thoren
Smallwood
wanted
to
push
on
into
the
mountains.
вЂњMance
Rayder
knows
he
must
battle
the
Watch,вЂќ
Thoren
had
declared,
вЂњbut
he
will
never
look
for
us
so
far
north.
If
we
ride
up
the
Milkwater,
we
can
take
him
unawares
and
cut
his
host
to
ribbons
before
he
knows
we
are
on
him.вЂќ

вЂњThe
numbers
would
be
greatly
against
us,вЂќ
Ser
Ottyn
had
objected.
вЂњCraster
said
he
was
gathering
a
great
host.
Many
thousands.
Without
Qhorin,
we
are
only
two
hundred.вЂќ

вЂњSend
two
hundred
wolves
against
ten
thousand
sheep,
ser,
and
see
what
happens,вЂќ
said
Smallwood
confidently.

вЂњThere
are
goats
among
these
sheep,
Thoren,вЂќ
warned
Jarman
Buckwell.
вЂњAye,
and
maybe
a
few
lions.
Rattleshirt,
Harma
the
Dogshead,
Alfyn
CrowkillerвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
know
them
as
well
as
you
do,
Buckwell,вЂќ
Thoren
Smallwood
snapped
back.
вЂњAnd
I
mean
to
have
their
heads,
every
one.
These
are
wildlings.
No
soldiers.
A
few
hundred
heroes,
drunk
most
like,
amidst
a
great
horde
of
women,
children,
and
thralls.
We
will
sweep
over
them
and
send
them
howling
back
to
their
hovels.вЂќ

They
had
argued
for
many
hours,
and
reached
no
agreement.
The
Old
Bear
was
too
stubborn
to
retreat,
but
neither
would
he
rush
headlong
up
the
Milkwater,
seeking
battle.
In
the
end,
nothing
had
been
decided
but
to
wait
a
few
more
days
for
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower,
and
talk
again
if
they
did
not
appear.

And
now
they
had,
which
meant
that
the
decision
could
be
delayed
no
longer.
Jon
was
glad
of
that
much,
at
least.
If
they
must
battle
Mance
Rayder,
let
it
be
soon.

He
found
Dolorous
Edd
at
the
fire,
complaining
about
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
sleep
when
people
insisted
on
blowing
horns
in
the
woods.
Jon
gave
him
something
new
to
complain
about.
Together
they
woke
Hake,
who
received
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
orders
with
a
stream
of
curses,
but
got
up
all
the
same
and
soon
had
a
dozen
brothers
cutting
roots
for
a
soup.

Sam
came
puffing
up
as
Jon
crossed
the
camp.
Under
the
black
hood
his
face
was
as
pale
and
round
as
the
moon.
вЂњI
heard
the
horn.
Has
your
uncle
come
back?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
only
the
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower.вЂќ
It
was
growing
harder
to
cling
to
the
hope
of
Benjen
StarkвЂ™s
safe
return.
The
cloak
he
had
found
beneath
the
Fist
could
well
have
belonged
to
his
uncle
or
one
of
his
men,
even
the
Old
Bear
admitted
as
much,
though
why
they
would
have
buried
it
there,
wrapped
around
the
cache
of
dragonglass,
no
one
could
say.
вЂњSam,
I
have
to
go.вЂќ

At
the
ringwall,
he
found
the
guards
sliding
spikes
from
the
half-frozen
earth
to
make
an
opening.
It
was
not
long
until
the
first
of
the
brothers
from
the
Shadow
Tower
began
wending
their
way
up
the
slope.
All
in
leather
and
fur
they
were,
with
here
and
there
a
bit
of
steel
or
bronze;
heavy
beards
covered
hard
lean
faces,
and
made
them
look
as
shaggy
as
their
garrons.
Jon
was
surprised
to
see
some
of
them
were
riding
two
to
a
horse.
When
he
looked
more
closely,
it
was
plain
that
many
of
them
were
wounded.
There
has
been
trouble
on
the
way.

Jon
knew
Qhorin
Halfhand
the
instant
he
saw
him,
though
they
had
never
met.
The
big
ranger
was
half
a
legend
in
the
Watch;
a
man
of
slow
words
and
swift
action,
tall
and
straight
as
a
spear,
long-limbed
and
solemn.
Unlike
his
men,
he
was
clean-shaven.
His
hair
fell
from
beneath
his
helm
in
a
heavy
braid
touched
with
hoarfrost,
and
the
blacks
he
wore
were
so
faded
they
might
have
been
greys.
Only
thumb
and
forefinger
remained
on
the
hand
that
held
the
reins;
the
other
fingers
had
been
sheared
off
catching
a
wildlingвЂ™s
axe
that
would
otherwise
have
split
his
skull.
It
was
told
that
he
had
thrust
his
maimed
fist
into
the
face
of
the
axeman
so
the
blood
spurted
into
his
eyes,
and
slew
him
while
he
was
blind.
Since
that
day,
the
wildlings
beyond
the
Wall
had
known
no
foe
more
implacable.

Jon
hailed
him.
вЂњLord
Commander
Mormont
would
see
you
at
once.
IвЂ™ll
show
you
to
his
tent.вЂќ

Qhorin
swung
down
from
his
saddle.
вЂњMy
men
are
hungry,
and
our
horses
require
tending.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
all
be
seen
to.вЂќ

The
ranger
gave
his
horse
into
the
care
of
one
of
his
men
and
followed.
вЂњYou
are
Jon
Snow.
You
have
your
fatherвЂ™s
look.вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
know
him,
my
lord?вЂќ

вЂњI
am
no
lordling.
Only
a
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.
I
knew
Lord
Eddard,
yes.
And
his
father
before
him.вЂќ

Jon
had
to
hurry
his
steps
to
keep
up
with
QhorinвЂ™s
long
strides.
вЂњLord
Rickard
died
before
I
was
born.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
a
friend
to
the
Watch.вЂќ
Qhorin
glanced
behind.
вЂњIt
is
said
that
a
direwolf
runs
with
you.вЂќ

вЂњGhost
should
be
back
by
dawn.
He
hunts
at
night.вЂќ

They
found
Dolorous
Edd
frying
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
boiling
a
dozen
eggs
in
a
kettle
over
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
cookfire.
Mormont
sat
in
his
wood-and-leather
camp
chair.
вЂњI
had
begun
to
fear
for
you.
Did
you
meet
with
trouble?вЂќ

вЂњWe
met
with
Alfyn
Crowkiller.
Mance
had
sent
him
to
scout
along
the
Wall,
and
we
chanced
on
him
returning.вЂќ
Qhorin
removed
his
helm.
вЂњAlfyn
will
trouble
the
realm
no
longer,
but
some
of
his
company
escaped
us.
We
hunted
down
as
many
as
we
could,
but
it
may
be
that
a
few
will
win
back
to
the
mountains.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
cost?вЂќ

вЂњFour
brothers
dead.
A
dozen
wounded.
A
third
as
many
as
the
foe.
And
we
took
captives.
One
died
quickly
from
his
wounds,
but
the
other
lived
long
enough
to
be
questioned.вЂќ

вЂњBest
talk
of
this
inside.
Jon
will
fetch
you
a
horn
of
ale.
Or
would
you
prefer
hot
spiced
wine?вЂќ

вЂњBoiled
water
will
suffice.
An
egg
and
a
bite
of
bacon.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
wish.вЂќ
Mormont
lifted
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
stooped
and
stepped
through.

Edd
stood
over
the
kettle
swishing
the
eggs
about
with
a
spoon.
вЂњI
envy
those
eggs,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
could
do
with
a
bit
of
boiling
about
now.
If
the
kettle
were
larger,
I
might
jump
in.
Though
I
would
sooner
it
were
wine
than
water.
There
are
worse
ways
to
die
than
warm
and
drunk.
I
knew
a
brother
drowned
himself
in
wine
once.
It
was
a
poor
vintage,
though,
and
his
corpse
did
not
improve
it.вЂќ

вЂњYou
drank
the
wine?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
an
awful
thing
to
find
a
brother
dead.
YouвЂ™d
have
need
of
a
drink
as
well,
Lord
Snow.вЂќ
Edd
stirred
the
kettle
and
added
a
pinch
more
nutmeg.

Restless,
Jon
squatted
by
the
fire
and
poked
at
it
with
a
stick.
He
could
hear
the
Old
BearвЂ™s
voice
inside
the
tent,
punctuated
by
the
ravenвЂ™s
squawks
and
Qhorin
HalfhandвЂ™s
quieter
tones,
but
he
could
not
make
out
the
words.
Alfyn
Crowkiller
dead,
thatвЂ™s
good.
He
was
one
of
the
bloodiest
of
the
wildling
raiders,
taking
his
name
from
the
black
brothers
heвЂ™d
slain.
So
why
does
Qhorin
sound
so
grave,
after
such
a
victory?

Jon
had
hoped
that
the
arrival
of
men
from
the
Shadow
Tower
would
lift
the
spirits
in
the
camp.
Only
last
night,
he
was
coming
back
through
the
dark
from
a
piss
when
he
heard
five
or
six
men
talking
in
low
voices
around
the
embers
of
a
fire.
When
he
heard
Chett
muttering
that
it
was
past
time
they
turned
back,
Jon
stopped
to
listen.
вЂњItвЂ™s
an
old
manвЂ™s
folly,
this
ranging,вЂќ
he
heard.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
find
nothing
but
our
graves
in
them
mountains.вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
giants
in
the
Frostfangs,
and
wargs,
and
worse
things,вЂќ
said
Lark
the
Sisterman.

вЂњIвЂ™ll
not
be
going
there,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Old
BearвЂ™s
not
like
to
give
you
a
choice.вЂќ

вЂњMight
be
we
wonвЂ™t
give
him
one,вЂќ
said
Chett.

Just
then
one
of
the
dogs
had
raised
his
head
and
growled,
and
he
had
to
move
away
quickly,
before
he
was
seen.
I
was
not
meant
to
hear
that,
he
thought.
He
considered
taking
the
tale
to
Mormont,
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
inform
on
his
brothers,
even
brothers
such
as
Chett
and
the
Sisterman.
It
was
just
empty
talk,
he
told
himself.
They
are
cold
and
afraid,
we
all
are.
It
was
hard
waiting
here,
perched
on
the
stony
summit
above
the
forest,
wondering
what
the
morrow
might
bring.
The
unseen
enemy
is
always
the
most
fearsome.

Jon
slid
his
new
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
studied
the
flames
as
they
played
against
the
shiny
black
glass.
He
had
fashioned
the
wooden
hilt
himself,
and
wound
hempen
twine
around
it
to
make
a
grip.
Ugly,
but
it
served.
Dolorous
Edd
opined
that
glass
knives
were
about
as
useful
as
nipples
on
a
knightвЂ™s
breastplate,
but
Jon
was
not
so
certain.
The
dragonglass
blade
was
sharper
than
steel,
albeit
far
more
brittle.

It
must
have
been
buried
for
a
reason.

He
had
made
a
dagger
for
Grenn
as
well,
and
another
for
the
Lord
Commander.
The
warhorn
he
had
given
to
Sam.
On
closer
examination
the
horn
had
proved
cracked,
and
even
after
he
had
cleaned
all
the
dirt
out,
Jon
had
been
unable
to
get
any
sound
from
it.
The
rim
was
chipped
as
well,
but
Sam
liked
old
things,
even
worthless
old
things.
вЂњMake
a
drinking
horn
out
of
it,вЂќ
Jon
told
him,
вЂњand
every
time
you
take
a
drink
youвЂ™ll
remember
how
you
ranged
beyond
the
Wall,
all
the
way
to
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men.вЂќ
He
gave
Sam
a
spearhead
and
a
dozen
arrowheads
as
well,
and
passed
the
rest
out
among
his
other
friends
for
luck.

The
Old
Bear
had
seemed
pleased
by
the
dagger,
but
he
preferred
a
steel
knife
at
his
belt,
Jon
had
noticed.
Mormont
could
offer
no
answers
as
to
who
might
have
buried
the
cloak
or
what
it
might
mean.
Perhaps
Qhorin
will
know.
The
Halfhand
had
ventured
deeper
into
the
wild
than
any
other
living
man.

вЂњYou
want
to
serve,
or
shall
I?вЂќ

Jon
sheathed
the
dagger.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
do
it.вЂќ
He
wanted
to
hear
what
they
were
saying.

Edd
cut
three
thick
slices
off
a
stale
round
of
oat
bread,
stacked
them
on
a
wooden
platter,
covered
them
with
bacon
and
bacon
drippings,
and
filled
a
bowl
with
hard-cooked
eggs.
Jon
took
the
bowl
in
one
hand
and
the
platter
in
the
other
and
backed
into
the
Lord
CommanderвЂ™s
tent.

Qhorin
was
seated
cross-legged
on
the
floor,
his
spine
as
straight
as
a
spear.
Candlelight
flickered
against
the
hard
flat
planes
of
his
cheeks
as
he
spoke.
вЂњвЂ¦Rattleshirt,
the
Weeping
Man,
and
every
other
chief
great
and
small,вЂќ
he
was
saying.
вЂњThey
have
wargs
as
well,
and
mammoths,
and
more
strength
than
we
would
have
dreamed.
Or
so
he
claimed.
I
will
not
swear
as
to
the
truth
of
it.
Ebben
believes
the
man
was
telling
us
tales
to
make
his
life
last
a
little
longer.вЂќ

вЂњTrue
or
false,
the
Wall
must
be
warned,вЂќ
the
Old
Bear
said
as
Jon
placed
the
platter
between
them.
вЂњAnd
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњWhich
king?вЂќ

вЂњAll
of
them.
The
true
and
the
false
alike.
If
they
would
claim
the
realm,
let
them
defend
it.вЂќ

The
Halfhand
helped
himself
to
an
egg
and
cracked
it
on
the
edge
of
the
bowl.
вЂњThese
kings
will
do
what
they
will,вЂќ
he
said,
peeling
away
the
shell.
вЂњLikely
it
will
be
little
enough.
The
best
hope
is
Winterfell.
The
Starks
must
rally
the
north.вЂќ

вЂњYes.
To
be
sure.вЂќ
The
Old
Bear
unrolled
a
map,
frowned
at
it,
tossed
it
aside,
opened
another.
He
was
pondering
where
the
hammer
would
fall,
Jon
could
see
it.
The
Watch
had
once
manned
seventeen
castles
along
the
hundred
leagues
of
the
Wall,
but
they
had
been
abandoned
one
by
one
as
the
brotherhood
dwindled.
Only
three
were
now
garrisoned,
a
fact
that
Mance
Rayder
knew
as
well
as
they
did.
вЂњSer
Alliser
Thorne
will
bring
back
fresh
levies
from
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
we
can
hope.
If
we
man
Greyguard
from
the
Shadow
Tower
and
the
Long
Barrow
from
EastwatchвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњGreyguard
has
largely
collapsed.
Stonedoor
would
serve
better,
if
the
men
could
be
found.
Icemark
and
Deep
Lake
as
well,
mayhaps.
With
daily
patrols
along
the
battlements
between.вЂќ

вЂњPatrols,
aye.
Twice
a
day,
if
we
can.
The
Wall
itself
is
a
formidable
obstacle.
Undefended,
it
cannot
stop
them,
yet
it
will
delay
them.
The
larger
the
host,
the
longer
theyвЂ™ll
require.
From
the
emptiness
theyвЂ™ve
left
behind,
they
must
mean
to
bring
their
women
with
them.
Their
young
as
well,
and
beastsвЂ¦
have
you
ever
seen
a
goat
climb
a
ladder?
A
rope?
They
will
need
to
build
a
stair,
or
a
great
rampвЂ¦
it
will
take
a
moonвЂ™s
turn
at
the
least,
perhaps
longer.
Mance
will
know
his
best
chance
is
to
pass
beneath
the
Wall.
Through
a
gate,
orвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњA
breach.вЂќ

MormontвЂ™s
head
came
up
sharply.
вЂњWhat?вЂќ

вЂњThey
do
not
plan
to
climb
the
Wall
nor
to
burrow
beneath
it,
my
lord.
They
plan
to
break
it.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Wall
is
seven
hundred
feet
high,
and
so
thick
at
the
base
that
it
would
take
a
hundred
men
a
year
to
cut
through
it
with
picks
and
axes.вЂќ

вЂњEven
so.вЂќ

Mormont
plucked
at
his
beard,
frowning.
вЂњHow?вЂќ

вЂњHow
else?
Sorcery.вЂќ
Qhorin
bit
the
egg
in
half.
вЂњWhy
else
would
Mance
choose
to
gather
his
strength
in
the
Frostfangs?
Bleak
and
hard
they
are,
and
a
long
weary
march
from
the
Wall.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
hoped
he
chose
the
mountains
to
hide
his
muster
from
the
eyes
of
my
rangers.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps,вЂќ
said
Qhorin,
finishing
the
egg,
вЂњbut
there
is
more,
I
think.
He
is
seeking
something
in
the
high
cold
places.
He
is
searching
for
something
he
needs.вЂќ

вЂњSomething?вЂќ
MormontвЂ™s
raven
lifted
its
head
and
screamed.
The
sound
was
sharp
as
a
knife
in
the
closeness
of
the
tent.

вЂњSome
power.
What
it
is,
our
captive
could
not
say.
He
was
questioned
perhaps
too
sharply,
and
died
with
much
unsaid.
I
doubt
he
knew
in
any
case.вЂќ

Jon
could
hear
the
wind
outside.
It
made
a
high
thin
sound
as
it
shivered
through
the
stones
of
the
ringwall
and
tugged
at
the
tent
ropes.
Mormont
rubbed
his
mouth
thoughtfully.
вЂњSome
power,вЂќ
he
repeated.
вЂњI
must
know.вЂќ

вЂњThen
you
must
send
scouts
into
the
mountains.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
loath
to
risk
more
men.вЂќ

вЂњWe
can
only
die.
Why
else
do
we
don
these
black
cloaks,
but
to
die
in
defense
of
the
realm?
I
would
send
fifteen
men,
in
three
parties
of
five.
One
to
probe
the
Milkwater,
one
the
Skirling
Pass,
one
to
climb
the
GiantвЂ™s
Stair.
Jarman
Buckwell,
Thoren
Smallwood,
and
myself
to
command.
To
learn
what
waits
in
those
mountains.вЂќ

вЂњWaits,вЂќ
the
raven
cried.
вЂњWaits.вЂќ

Lord
Commander
Mormont
sighed
deep
in
his
chest.
вЂњI
see
no
other
choice,вЂќ
he
conceded,
вЂњbut
if
you
do
not
returnвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSomeone
will
come
down
out
of
the
Frostfangs,
my
lord,вЂќ
the
ranger
said.
вЂњIf
us,
all
well
and
good.
If
not,
it
will
be
Mance
Rayder,
and
you
sit
square
in
his
path.
He
cannot
march
south
and
leave
you
behind,
to
follow
and
harry
his
rear.
He
must
attack.
This
is
a
strong
place.вЂќ

вЂњNot
that
strong,вЂќ
said
Mormont.

вЂњBelike
we
shall
all
die,
then.
Our
dying
will
buy
time
for
our
brothers
on
the
Wall.
Time
to
garrison
the
empty
castles
and
freeze
shut
the
gates,
time
to
summon
lords
and
kings
to
their
aid,
time
to
hone
their
axes
and
repair
their
catapults.
Our
lives
will
be
coin
well
spent.вЂќ

вЂњDie,вЂќ
the
raven
muttered,
pacing
along
MormontвЂ™s
shoulders.
вЂњDie,
die,
die,
die.вЂќ
The
old
Bear
sat
slumped
and
silent,
as
if
the
burden
of
speech
had
grown
too
heavy
for
him
to
bear.
But
at
last
he
said,
вЂњMay
the
gods
forgive
me.
Choose
your
men.вЂќ

Qhorin
Halfhand
turned
his
head.
His
eyes
met
JonвЂ™s,
and
held
them
for
a
long
moment.
вЂњVery
well.
I
choose
Jon
Snow.вЂќ

Mormont
blinked.
вЂњHe
is
hardly
more
than
a
boy.
And
my
steward
besides.
Not
even
a
ranger.вЂќ

вЂњTollett
can
care
for
you
as
well,
my
lord.вЂќ
Qhorin
lifted
his
maimed,
two-fingered
hand.
вЂњThe
old
gods
are
still
strong
beyond
the
Wall.
The
gods
of
the
First
MenвЂ¦
and
the
Starks.вЂќ

Mormont
looked
at
Jon.
вЂњWhat
is
your
will
in
this?вЂќ

вЂњTo
go,вЂќ
he
said
at
once.

The
old
man
smiled
sadly.
вЂњI
thought
it
might
be.вЂќ

Dawn
had
broken
when
Jon
stepped
from
the
tent
beside
Qhorin
Halfhand.
The
wind
swirled
around
them,
stirring
their
black
cloaks
and
sending
a
scatter
of
red
cinders
flying
from
the
fire.

вЂњWe
ride
at
noon,вЂќ
the
ranger
told
him.
вЂњBest
find
that
wolf
of
yours.вЂќ





TYRION

вЂњThe
queen
intends
to
send
Prince
Tommen
away.вЂќ
They
knelt
alone
in
the
hushed
dimness
of
the
sept,
surrounded
by
shadows
and
flickering
candles,
but
even
so
Lancel
kept
his
voice
low.
вЂњLord
Gyles
will
take
him
to
Rosby,
and
conceal
him
there
in
the
guise
of
a
page.
They
plan
to
darken
his
hair
and
tell
everyone
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
hedge
knight.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
the
mob
she
fears?
Or
me?вЂќ

вЂњBoth,вЂќ
said
Lancel.

вЂњAh.вЂќ
Tyrion
had
known
nothing
of
this
ploy.
Had
VarysвЂ™s
little
birds
failed
him
for
once?
Even
spiders
must
nod,
he
supposedвЂ¦
or
was
the
eunuch
playing
a
deeper
and
more
subtle
game
than
he
knew?
вЂњYou
have
my
thanks,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњWill
you
grant
me
the
boon
I
asked
of
you?вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps.вЂќ
Lancel
wanted
his
own
command
in
the
next
battle.
A
splendid
way
to
die
before
he
finished
growing
that
mustache,
but
young
knights
always
think
themselves
invincible.

Tyrion
lingered
after
his
cousin
had
slipped
away.
At
the
WarriorвЂ™s
altar,
he
used
one
candle
to
light
another.
Watch
over
my
brother,
you
bloody
bastard,
heвЂ™s
one
of
yours.
He
lit
a
second
candle
to
the
Stranger,
for
himself.

That
night,
when
the
Red
Keep
was
dark,
Bronn
arrived
to
find
him
sealing
a
letter.
вЂњTake
this
to
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater.вЂќ
The
dwarf
dribbled
hot
golden
wax
down
onto
the
parchment.

вЂњWhat
does
it
say?вЂќ
Bronn
could
not
read,
so
he
asked
impudent
questions.

вЂњThat
heвЂ™s
to
take
fifty
of
his
best
swords
and
scout
the
roseroad.вЂќ
Tyrion
pressed
his
seal
into
the
soft
wax.

вЂњStannis
is
more
like
to
come
up
the
kingsroad.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
know.
Tell
Bywater
to
disregard
whatвЂ™s
in
the
letter
and
take
his
men
north.
HeвЂ™s
to
lay
a
trap
along
the
Rosby
road.
Lord
Gyles
will
depart
for
his
castle
in
a
day
or
two,
with
a
dozen
men-at-arms,
some
servants,
and
my
nephew.
Prince
Tommen
may
be
dressed
as
a
page.вЂќ

вЂњYou
want
the
boy
brought
back,
is
that
it?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
I
want
him
taken
on
to
the
castle.вЂќ
Removing
the
boy
from
the
city
was
one
of
his
sisterвЂ™s
better
notions,
Tyrion
had
decided.
At
Rosby,
Tommen
would
be
safe
from
the
mob,
and
keeping
him
apart
from
his
brother
also
made
things
more
difficult
for
Stannis;
even
if
he
took
KingвЂ™s
Landing
and
executed
Joffrey,
heвЂ™d
still
have
a
Lannister
claimant
to
contend
with.
вЂњLord
Gyles
is
too
sickly
to
run
and
too
craven
to
fight.
HeвЂ™ll
command
his
castellan
to
open
the
gates.
Once
inside
the
walls,
Bywater
is
to
expel
the
garrison
and
hold
Tommen
there
safe.
Ask
him
how
he
likes
the
sound
of
Lord
Bywater.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Bronn
would
sound
better.
I
could
grab
the
boy
for
you
just
as
well.
IвЂ™ll
dandle
him
on
my
knee
and
sing
him
nursery
songs
if
thereвЂ™s
a
lordship
in
it.вЂќ

вЂњI
need
you
here,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
And
I
donвЂ™t
trust
you
with
my
nephew.
Should
any
ill
befall
Joffrey,
the
Lannister
claim
to
the
Iron
Throne
would
rest
on
TommenвЂ™s
young
shoulders.
Ser
JacelynвЂ™s
gold
cloaks
would
defend
the
boy;
BronnвЂ™s
sellswords
were
more
apt
to
sell
him
to
his
enemies.

вЂњWhat
should
the
new
lord
do
with
the
old
one?вЂќ

вЂњWhatever
he
pleases,
so
long
as
he
remembers
to
feed
him.
I
donвЂ™t
want
him
dying.вЂќ
Tyrion
pushed
away
from
the
table.
вЂњMy
sister
will
send
one
of
the
Kingsguard
with
the
prince.вЂќ

Bronn
was
not
concerned.
вЂњThe
Hound
is
JoffreyвЂ™s
dog,
he
wonвЂ™t
leave
him.
IronhandвЂ™s
gold
cloaks
should
be
able
to
handle
the
others
easy
enough.вЂќ

вЂњIf
it
comes
to
killing,
tell
Ser
Jacelyn
I
wonвЂ™t
have
it
done
in
front
of
Tommen.вЂќ
Tyrion
donned
a
heavy
cloak
of
dark
brown
wool.
вЂњMy
nephew
is
tender-hearted.вЂќ

вЂњAre
you
certain
heвЂ™s
a
Lannister?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
certain
of
nothing
but
winter
and
battle,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњCome.
IвЂ™m
riding
with
you
part
of
the
way.вЂќ

вЂњChatayaвЂ™s?вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
me
too
well.вЂќ

They
left
through
a
postern
gate
in
the
north
wall.
Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
clattered
down
Shadowblack
Lane.
A
few
furtive
shapes
darted
into
alleys
at
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
on
the
cobbles,
but
no
one
dared
accost
them.
The
council
had
extended
his
curfew;
it
was
death
to
be
taken
on
the
streets
after
the
evenfall
bells
had
sung.
The
measure
had
restored
a
degree
of
peace
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
and
quartered
the
number
of
corpses
found
in
the
alleys
of
a
morning,
yet
Varys
said
the
people
cursed
him
for
it.
They
should
be
thankful
they
have
the
breath
to
curse.
A
pair
of
gold
cloaks
confronted
them
as
they
were
making
their
way
along
CoppersmithвЂ™s
Wynd,
but
when
they
realized
whom
theyвЂ™d
challenged
they
begged
the
HandвЂ™s
pardons
and
waved
them
on.
Bronn
turned
south
for
the
Mud
Gate
and
they
parted
company.

Tyrion
rode
on
toward
ChatayaвЂ™s,
but
suddenly
his
patience
deserted
him.
He
twisted
in
the
saddle,
scanning
the
street
behind.
There
were
no
signs
of
followers.
Every
window
was
dark
or
tightly
shuttered.
He
heard
nothing
but
the
wind
swirling
down
the
alleys.
If
Cersei
has
someone
stalking
me
tonight,
he
must
be
disguised
as
a
rat.
вЂњBugger
it
all,вЂќ
he
muttered.
He
was
sick
of
caution.
Wheeling
his
horse
around,
he
dug
in
his
spurs.
If
anyoneвЂ™s
after
me,
weвЂ™ll
see
how
well
they
ride.
He
flew
through
the
moonlight
streets,
clattering
over
cobbles,
darting
down
narrow
alleys
and
up
twisty
wynds,
racing
to
his
love.

As
he
hammered
on
the
gate
he
heard
music
wafting
faintly
over
the
spiked
stone
walls.
One
of
the
Ibbenese
ushered
him
inside.
Tyrion
gave
the
man
his
horse
and
said,
вЂњWho
is
that?вЂќ
The
diamond-shaped
panes
of
the
longhall
windows
shone
with
yellow
light,
and
he
could
hear
a
man
singing.

The
Ibbenese
shrugged.
вЂњFatbelly
singer.вЂќ

The
sound
swelled
as
he
walked
from
the
stable
to
the
house.
Tyrion
had
never
been
fond
of
singers,
and
he
liked
this
one
even
less
than
the
run
of
the
breed,
sight
unseen.
When
he
pushed
open
the
door,
the
man
broke
off.
вЂњMy
lord
Hand.вЂќ
He
knelt,
balding
and
kettle-bellied,
murmuring,
вЂњAn
honor,
an
honor.вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord.вЂќ
Shae
smiled
at
the
sight
of
him.
He
liked
that
smile,
the
quick
unthinking
way
it
came
to
her
pretty
face.
The
girl
wore
her
purple
silk,
belted
with
a
cloth-of-silver
sash.
The
colors
favored
her
dark
hair
and
the
smooth
cream
of
her
skin.

вЂњSweetling,вЂќ
he
called
her.
вЂњAnd
who
is
this?вЂќ

The
singer
raised
his
eyes.
вЂњI
am
called
Symon
Silver
Tongue,
my
lord.
A
player,
a
singer,
a
taletellerвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњAnd
a
great
fool,вЂќ
Tyrion
finished.
вЂњWhat
did
you
call
me,
when
I
entered?вЂќ

вЂњCall?
I
onlyвЂ¦вЂќ
The
silver
in
SymonвЂ™s
tongue
seemed
to
have
turned
to
lead.
вЂњMy
lord
Hand,
I
said,
an
honorвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњA
wiser
man
would
have
pretended
not
to
recognize
me.
Not
that
I
would
have
been
fooled,
but
you
ought
to
have
tried.
What
am
I
to
do
with
you
now?
You
know
of
my
sweet
Shae,
you
know
where
she
dwells,
you
know
that
I
visit
by
night
alone.вЂќ

вЂњI
swear,
IвЂ™ll
tell
no
oneвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOn
that
much
we
agree.
Good
night
to
you.вЂќ
Tyrion
led
Shae
up
the
stairs.

вЂњMy
singer
may
never
sing
again
now,вЂќ
she
teased.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
scared
the
voice
from
him.вЂќ

вЂњA
little
fear
will
help
him
reach
those
high
notes.вЂќ

She
closed
the
door
to
their
bedchamber.
вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
hurt
him,
will
you?вЂќ
She
lit
a
scented
candle
and
knelt
to
pull
off
his
boots.
вЂњHis
songs
cheer
me
on
the
nights
you
donвЂ™t
come.вЂќ

вЂњWould
that
I
could
come
every
night,вЂќ
he
said
as
she
rubbed
his
bare
feet.
вЂњHow
well
does
he
sing?вЂќ

вЂњBetter
than
some.
Not
so
good
as
others.вЂќ

Tyrion
opened
her
robe
and
buried
his
face
between
her
breasts.
She
always
smelled
clean
to
him,
even
in
this
reeking
sty
of
a
city.
вЂњKeep
him
if
you
like,
but
keep
him
close.
I
wonвЂ™t
have
him
wandering
the
city
spreading
tales
in
pot-shops.вЂќ

вЂњHe
wonвЂ™tвЂ”вЂќ
she
started.

Tyrion
covered
her
mouth
with
his
own.
HeвЂ™d
had
talk
enough;
he
needed
the
sweet
simplicity
of
the
pleasure
he
found
between
ShaeвЂ™s
thighs.
Here,
at
least,
he
was
welcome,
wanted.

Afterward,
he
eased
his
arm
out
from
under
her
head,
slipped
on
his
tunic,
and
went
down
to
the
garden.
A
half-moon
silvered
the
leaves
of
the
fruit
trees
and
shone
on
the
surface
of
the
stone
bathing
pond.
Tyrion
seated
himself
beside
the
water.
Somewhere
off
to
his
right
a
cricket
was
chirping,
a
curiously
homey
sound.
It
is
peaceful
here,
he
thought,
but
for
how
long?

A
whiff
of
something
rank
made
him
turn
his
head.
Shae
stood
in
the
door
behind
him,
dressed
in
the
silvery
robe
heвЂ™d
given
her.
I
loved
a
maid
as
white
as
winter,
with
moonglow
in
her
hair.
Behind
her
stood
one
of
the
begging
brothers,
a
portly
man
in
filthy
patched
robes,
his
bare
feet
crusty
with
dirt,
a
bowl
hung
about
his
neck
on
a
leather
thong
where
a
septon
would
have
worn
a
crystal.
The
smell
of
him
would
have
gagged
a
rat.

вЂњLord
Varys
has
come
to
see
you,вЂќ
Shae
announced.

The
begging
brother
blinked
at
her,
astonished.
Tyrion
laughed.
вЂњTo
be
sure.
How
is
it
you
knew
him
when
I
did
not?вЂќ

She
shrugged.
вЂњItвЂ™s
still
him.
Only
dressed
different.вЂќ

вЂњA
different
look,
a
different
smell,
a
different
way
of
walking,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњMost
men
would
be
deceived.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
most
women,
maybe.
But
not
whores.
A
whore
learns
to
see
the
man,
not
his
garb,
or
she
turns
up
dead
in
an
alley.вЂќ

Varys
looked
pained,
and
not
because
of
the
false
scabs
on
his
feet.
Tyrion
chuckled.
вЂњShae,
would
you
bring
us
some
wine?вЂќ
He
might
need
a
drink.
Whatever
brought
the
eunuch
here
in
the
dead
of
night
was
not
like
to
be
good.

вЂњI
almost
fear
to
tell
you
why
IвЂ™ve
come,
my
lord,вЂќ
Varys
said
when
Shae
had
left
them.
вЂњI
bring
dire
tidings.вЂќ

вЂњYou
ought
to
dress
in
black
feathers,
Varys,
youвЂ™re
as
bad
an
omen
as
any
raven.вЂќ
Awkwardly,
Tyrion
pushed
to
his
feet,
half
afraid
to
ask
the
next
question.
вЂњIs
it
Jaime?вЂќ
If
they
have
harmed
him,
nothing
will
save
them.

вЂњNo,
my
lord.
A
different
matter.
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
is
dead.
StormвЂ™s
End
has
opened
its
gates
to
Stannis
Baratheon.вЂќ

Dismay
drove
all
other
thoughts
from
TyrionвЂ™s
mind.
When
Shae
returned
with
the
wine,
he
took
one
sip
and
flung
the
cup
away
to
explode
against
the
side
of
the
house.
She
raised
a
hand
to
shield
herself
from
the
shards
as
the
wine
ran
down
the
stones
in
long
fingers,
black
in
the
moonlight.
вЂњDamn
him!вЂќ
Tyrion
said.

Varys
smiled,
showing
a
mouth
full
of
rotted
teeth.
вЂњWho,
my
lord?
Ser
Cortnay
or
Lord
Stannis?вЂќ

вЂњBoth
of
them.вЂќ
StormвЂ™s
End
was
strong,
it
should
have
been
able
to
hold
out
for
half
a
year
or
moreвЂ¦
time
enough
for
his
father
to
finish
with
Robb
Stark.
вЂњHow
did
this
happen?вЂќ

Varys
glanced
at
Shae.
вЂњMy
lord,
must
we
trouble
your
sweet
ladyвЂ™s
sleep
with
such
grim
and
bloody
talk?вЂќ

вЂњA
lady
might
be
afraid,вЂќ
said
Shae,
вЂњbut
IвЂ™m
not.вЂќ

вЂњYou
should
be,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
her.
вЂњWith
StormвЂ™s
End
fallen,
Stannis
will
soon
turn
his
attention
toward
KingвЂ™s
Landing.вЂќ
He
regretted
flinging
away
that
wine
now.
вЂњLord
Varys,
give
us
a
moment,
and
IвЂ™ll
ride
back
to
the
castle
with
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
wait
in
the
stables.вЂќ
He
bowed
and
stomped
off.

Tyrion
drew
Shae
down
beside
him.
вЂњYou
are
not
safe
here.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
my
walls,
and
the
guards
you
gave
me.вЂќ

вЂњSellswords,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњThey
like
my
gold
well
enough,
but
will
they
die
for
it?
As
for
these
walls,
a
man
could
stand
on
anotherвЂ™s
shoulders
and
be
over
in
a
heartbeat.
A
manse
much
like
this
one
was
burned
during
the
riots.
They
killed
the
goldsmith
who
owned
it
for
the
crime
of
having
a
full
larder,
just
as
they
tore
the
High
Septon
to
pieces,
raped
Lollys
half
a
hundred
times,
and
smashed
Ser
AronвЂ™s
skull
in.
What
do
you
think
they
would
do
if
they
got
their
hands
on
the
HandвЂ™s
lady?вЂќ

вЂњThe
HandвЂ™s
whore,
you
mean?вЂќ
She
looked
at
him
with
those
big
bold
eyes
of
hers.
вЂњThough
I
would
be
your
lady,
mвЂ™lord.
IвЂ™d
dress
in
all
the
beautiful
things
you
gave
me,
in
satin
and
samite
and
cloth-of-gold,
and
IвЂ™d
wear
your
jewels
and
hold
your
hand
and
sit
by
you
at
feasts.
I
could
give
you
sons,
I
know
I
couldвЂ¦
and
I
vow
IвЂ™d
never
shame
you.вЂќ

My
love
for
you
shames
me
enough.
вЂњA
sweet
dream,
Shae.
Now
put
it
aside,
I
beg
you.
It
can
never
be.вЂќ

вЂњBecause
of
the
queen?
IвЂ™m
not
afraid
of
her
either.вЂќ

вЂњI
am.вЂќ

вЂњThen
kill
her
and
be
done
with
it.
ItвЂ™s
not
as
if
there
was
any
love
between
you.вЂќ

Tyrion
sighed.
вЂњSheвЂ™s
my
sister.
The
man
who
kills
his
own
blood
is
cursed
forever
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.
Moreover,
whatever
you
and
I
may
think
of
Cersei,
my
father
and
brother
hold
her
dear.
I
can
scheme
with
any
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
the
gods
have
not
equipped
me
to
face
Jaime
with
swords
in
hand.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Young
Wolf
and
Lord
Stannis
have
swords
and
they
donвЂ™t
scare
you.вЂќ

How
little
you
know,
sweetling.
вЂњAgainst
them
I
have
all
the
power
of
House
Lannister.
Against
Jaime
or
my
father,
I
have
no
more
than
a
twisted
back
and
a
pair
of
stunted
legs.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
me.вЂќ
Shae
kissed
him,
her
arms
sliding
around
his
neck
as
she
pressed
her
body
to
his.

The
kiss
aroused
him,
as
her
kisses
always
did,
but
this
time
Tyrion
gently
disentangled
himself.
вЂњNot
now.
Sweetling,
I
haveвЂ¦
well,
call
it
the
seed
of
a
plan.
I
think
I
might
be
able
to
bring
you
into
the
castle
kitchens.вЂќ

ShaeвЂ™s
face
went
still.
вЂњThe
kitchens?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
If
I
act
through
Varys,
no
one
will
be
the
wiser.вЂќ

She
giggled.
вЂњMвЂ™lord,
IвЂ™d
poison
you.
Every
man
whoвЂ™s
tasted
my
cooking
has
told
me
what
a
good
whore
I
am.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Red
Keep
has
sufficient
cooks.
Butchers
and
bakers
too.
YouвЂ™d
need
to
pose
as
a
scullion.вЂќ

вЂњA
pot
girl,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњin
scratchy
brown
roughspun.
Is
that
how
mвЂ™lord
wants
to
see
me?вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord
wants
to
see
you
alive,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњYou
can
scarcely
scour
pots
in
silk
and
velvet.вЂќ

вЂњHas
mвЂ™lord
grown
tired
of
me?вЂќ
She
reached
a
hand
under
his
tunic
and
found
his
cock.
In
two
quick
strokes
she
had
it
hard.
вЂњHe
still
wants
me.вЂќ
She
laughed.
вЂњWould
you
like
to
fuck
your
kitchen
wench,
mвЂ™lord?
You
can
dust
me
with
flour
and
suck
gravy
off
my
titties
if
youвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњStop
it.вЂќ
The
way
she
was
acting
reminded
him
of
Dancy,
who
had
tried
so
hard
to
win
her
wager.
He
yanked
her
hand
away
to
keep
her
from
further
mischief.
вЂњThis
is
not
the
time
for
bed
sport,
Shae.
Your
life
may
be
at
stake.вЂќ

Her
grin
was
gone.
вЂњIf
IвЂ™ve
displeased
mвЂ™lord,
I
never
meant
it,
onlyвЂ¦
couldnвЂ™t
you
just
give
me
more
guards?вЂќ

Tyrion
breathed
a
deep
sigh.
Remember
how
young
she
is,
he
told
himself.
He
took
her
hand.
вЂњYour
gems
can
be
replaced,
and
new
gowns
can
be
sewn
twice
as
lovely
as
the
old.
To
me,
youвЂ™re
the
most
precious
thing
within
these
walls.
The
Red
Keep
is
not
safe
either,
but
itвЂ™s
a
deal
safer
than
here.
I
want
you
there.вЂќ

вЂњIn
the
kitchens.вЂќ
Her
voice
was
flat.
вЂњScouring
pots.вЂќ

вЂњFor
a
short
while.вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
made
me
his
kitchen
wench,вЂќ
she
said,
her
mouth
twisting.
вЂњThat
was
why
I
ran
off.вЂќ

вЂњYou
told
me
you
ran
off
because
your
father
made
you
his
whore,вЂќ
he
reminded
her.

вЂњThat
too.
I
didnвЂ™t
like
scouring
his
pots
no
more
than
I
liked
his
cock
in
me.вЂќ
She
tossed
her
head.
вЂњWhy
canвЂ™t
you
keep
me
in
your
tower?
Half
the
lords
at
court
keep
bedwarmers.вЂќ

вЂњI
was
expressly
forbidden
to
take
you
to
court.вЂќ

вЂњBy
your
stupid
father.вЂќ
Shae
pouted.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
old
enough
to
keep
all
the
whores
you
want.
Does
he
take
you
for
a
beardless
boy?
What
could
he
do,
spank
you?вЂќ

He
slapped
her.
Not
hard,
but
hard
enough.
вЂњDamn
you,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњDamn
you.
Never
mock
me.
Not
you.вЂќ

For
a
moment
Shae
did
not
speak.
The
only
sound
was
the
cricket,
chirping,
chirping.
вЂњBeg
pardon,
mвЂ™lord,вЂќ
she
said
at
last,
in
a
heavy
wooden
voice.
вЂњI
never
meant
to
be
impudent.вЂќ

And
I
never
meant
to
strike
you.
Gods
be
good,
am
I
turning
into
Cersei?
вЂњThat
was
ill
done,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњOn
both
our
parts.
Shae,
you
do
not
understand.вЂќ
Words
he
had
never
meant
to
speak
came
tumbling
out
of
him
like
mummers
from
a
hollow
horse.
вЂњWhen
I
was
thirteen,
I
wed
a
crofterвЂ™s
daughter.
Or
so
I
thought
her.
I
was
blind
with
love
for
her,
and
thought
she
felt
the
same
for
me,
but
my
father
rubbed
my
face
in
the
truth.
My
bride
was
a
whore
Jaime
had
hired
to
give
me
my
first
taste
of
manhood.вЂќ
And
I
believed
all
of
it,
fool
that
I
was.
вЂњTo
drive
the
lesson
home,
Lord
Tywin
gave
my
wife
to
a
barracks
of
his
guardsmen
to
use
as
they
pleased,
and
commanded
me
to
watch.вЂќ
And
to
take
her
one
last
time,
after
the
rest
were
done.
One
last
time,
with
no
trace
of
love
or
tenderness
remaining.
вЂњSo
you
will
remember
her
as
she
truly
is,вЂќ
he
said,
and
I
should
have
defied
him,
but
my
cock
betrayed
me,
and
I
did
as
I
was
bid.
вЂњAfter
he
was
done
with
her,
my
father
had
the
marriage
undone.
It
was
as
if
we
had
never
been
wed,
the
septons
said.вЂќ
He
squeezed
her
hand.
вЂњPlease,
letвЂ™s
have
no
more
talk
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
You
will
be
in
the
kitchens
only
a
little
while.
Once
weвЂ™re
done
with
Stannis,
youвЂ™ll
have
another
manse,
and
silks
as
soft
as
your
hands.вЂќ

ShaeвЂ™s
eyes
had
grown
large
but
he
could
not
read
what
lay
behind
them.
вЂњMy
hands
wonвЂ™t
be
soft
if
I
clean
ovens
and
scrape
plates
all
day.
Will
you
still
want
them
touching
you
when
theyвЂ™re
all
red
and
raw
and
cracked
from
hot
water
and
lye
soap?вЂќ

вЂњMore
than
ever,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњWhen
I
look
at
them,
theyвЂ™ll
remind
me
how
brave
you
were.вЂќ

He
could
not
say
if
she
believed
him.
She
lowered
her
eyes.
вЂњI
am
yours
to
command,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

It
was
as
much
acceptance
as
she
could
give
tonight,
he
saw
that
plain
enough.
He
kissed
her
cheek
where
heвЂ™d
struck
her,
to
take
some
sting
from
the
blow.
вЂњI
will
send
for
you.вЂќ

Varys
was
waiting
in
the
stables,
as
promised.
His
horse
looked
spavined
and
half-dead.
Tyrion
mounted
up;
one
of
the
sellswords
opened
the
gates.
They
rode
out
in
silence.
Why
did
I
tell
her
about
Tysha,
gods
help
me?
he
asked
himself,
suddenly
afraid.
There
were
some
secrets
that
should
never
be
spoken,
some
shames
a
man
should
take
to
his
grave.
What
did
he
want
from
her,
forgiveness?
The
way
she
had
looked
at
him,
what
did
that
mean?
Did
she
hate
the
thought
of
scouring
pots
that
much,
or
was
it
his
confession?
How
could
I
tell
her
that
and
still
think
she
would
love
me?
part
of
him
said,
and
another
part
mocked,
saying,
Fool
of
a
dwarf,
it
is
only
the
gold
and
jewels
the
whore
loves.

His
scarred
elbow
was
throbbing,
jarred
every
time
the
horse
set
down
a
hoof.
Sometimes
he
could
almost
fancy
he
heard
the
bones
grinding
together
inside.
Perhaps
he
should
see
a
maester,
get
some
potion
for
the
painвЂ¦
but
since
Pycelle
had
revealed
himself
for
what
he
was,
Tyrion
Lannister
mistrusted
the
maesters.
The
gods
only
knew
who
they
were
conspiring
with,
or
what
they
had
mixed
in
those
potions
they
gave
you.
вЂњVarys,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
need
to
bring
Shae
into
the
castle
without
Cersei
becoming
aware.вЂќ
Briefly,
he
sketched
out
his
kitchen
scheme.

When
he
was
done,
the
eunuch
made
a
little
clucking
sound.
вЂњI
will
do
as
my
lord
commands,
of
courseвЂ¦
but
I
must
warn
you,
the
kitchens
are
full
of
eyes
and
ears.
Even
if
the
girl
falls
under
no
particular
suspicion,
she
will
be
subject
to
a
thousand
questions.
Where
was
she
born?
Who
were
her
parents?
How
did
she
come
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing?
The
truth
will
never
do,
so
she
must
lieвЂ¦
and
lie,
and
lie.вЂќ
He
glanced
down
at
Tyrion.
вЂњAnd
such
a
pretty
young
kitchen
wench
will
incite
lust
as
well
as
curiosity.
She
will
be
touched,
pinched,
patted,
and
fondled.
Pot
boys
will
crawl
under
her
blankets
of
a
night.
Some
lonely
cook
may
seek
to
wed
her.
Bakers
will
knead
her
breasts
with
floured
hands.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
have
her
fondled
than
stabbed,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.

Varys
rode
on
a
few
paces
and
said,
вЂњIt
might
be
that
there
is
another
way.
As
it
happens,
the
maidservant
who
attends
Lady
TandaвЂ™s
daughter
has
been
filching
her
jewels.
Were
I
to
inform
Lady
Tanda,
she
would
be
forced
to
dismiss
the
girl
at
once.
And
the
daughter
would
require
a
new
maidservant.вЂќ

вЂњI
see.вЂќ
This
had
possibilities,
Tyrion
saw
at
once.
A
ladyвЂ™s
bedmaid
wore
finer
garb
than
a
scullion,
and
often
even
a
jewel
or
two.
Shae
should
be
pleased
by
that.
And
Cersei
thought
Lady
Tanda
tedious
and
hysterical,
and
Lollys
a
bovine
lackwit.
She
was
not
like
to
pay
them
any
friendly
calls.

вЂњLollys
is
timid
and
trusting,вЂќ
Varys
said.
вЂњShe
will
accept
any
tale
she
is
told.
Since
the
mob
took
her
maidenhood
she
is
afraid
to
leave
her
chambers,
so
Shae
will
be
out
of
sightвЂ¦
but
conveniently
close,
should
you
have
need
of
comfort.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Tower
of
the
Hand
is
watched,
you
know
as
well
as
I.
Cersei
would
be
certain
to
grow
curious
if
LollysвЂ™s
bedmaid
starting
paying
me
calls.вЂќ

вЂњI
might
be
able
to
slip
the
child
into
your
bedchamber
unseen.
ChatayaвЂ™s
is
not
the
only
house
to
boast
a
hidden
door.вЂќ

вЂњA
secret
access?
To
my
chambers?вЂќ
Tyrion
was
more
annoyed
than
surprised.
Why
else
would
Maegor
the
Cruel
have
ordered
death
for
all
the
builders
who
had
worked
on
his
castle,
except
to
preserve
such
secrets?
вЂњYes,
I
suppose
there
would
be.
Where
will
I
find
the
door?
In
my
solar?
My
bedchamber?вЂќ

вЂњMy
friend,
you
would
not
force
me
to
reveal
all
my
little
secrets,
would
you?вЂќ

вЂњHenceforth
think
of
them
as
our
little
secrets,
Varys.вЂќ
Tyrion
glanced
up
at
the
eunuch
in
his
smelly
mummerвЂ™s
garb.
вЂњAssuming
you
are
on
my
sideвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњCan
you
doubt
it?вЂќ

вЂњWhy
no,
I
trust
you
implicitly.вЂќ
A
bitter
laugh
echoed
off
the
shuttered
windows.
вЂњI
trust
you
like
one
of
my
own
blood,
in
truth.
Now
tell
me
how
Cortnay
Penrose
died.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
said
that
he
threw
himself
from
a
tower.вЂќ

вЂњThrew
himself?
No,
I
will
not
believe
that!вЂќ

вЂњHis
guards
saw
no
man
enter
his
chambers,
nor
did
they
find
any
within
afterward.вЂќ

вЂњThen
the
killer
entered
earlier
and
hid
under
the
bed,вЂќ
Tyrion
suggested,
вЂњor
he
climbed
down
from
the
roof
on
a
rope.
Perhaps
the
guards
are
lying.
WhoвЂ™s
to
say
they
did
not
do
the
thing
themselves?вЂќ

вЂњDoubtless
you
are
right,
my
lord.вЂќ

His
smug
tone
said
otherwise.
вЂњBut
you
do
not
think
so?
How
was
it
done,
then?вЂќ

For
a
long
moment
Varys
said
nothing.
The
only
sound
was
the
stately
clack
of
horseshoes
on
cobbles.
Finally
the
eunuch
cleared
his
throat.
вЂњMy
lord,
do
you
believe
in
the
old
powers?вЂќ

вЂњMagic,
you
mean?вЂќ
Tyrion
said
impatiently.
вЂњBloodspells,
curses,
shapeshifting,
those
sorts
of
things?вЂќ
He
snorted.
вЂњDo
you
mean
to
suggest
that
Ser
Cortnay
was
magicked
to
his
death?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Cortnay
had
challenged
Lord
Stannis
to
single
combat
on
the
morning
he
died.
I
ask
you,
is
this
the
act
of
a
man
lost
to
despair?
Then
there
is
the
matter
of
Lord
RenlyвЂ™s
mysterious
and
most
fortuitous
murder,
even
as
his
battle
lines
were
forming
up
to
sweep
his
brother
from
the
field.вЂќ
The
eunuch
paused
a
moment.
вЂњMy
lord,
you
once
asked
me
how
it
was
that
I
was
cut.вЂќ

вЂњI
recall,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњYou
did
not
want
to
talk
of
it.вЂќ

вЂњNor
do
I,
butвЂ¦вЂќ
This
pause
was
longer
than
the
one
before,
and
when
Varys
spoke
again
his
voice
was
different
somehow.
вЂњI
was
an
orphan
boy
apprenticed
to
a
traveling
folly.
Our
master
owned
a
fat
little
cog
and
we
sailed
up
and
down
the
narrow
sea
performing
in
all
the
Free
Cities
and
from
time
to
time
in
Oldtown
and
KingвЂ™s
Landing.

вЂњOne
day
at
Myr,
a
certain
man
came
to
our
folly.
After
the
performance,
he
made
an
offer
for
me
that
my
master
found
too
tempting
to
refuse.
I
was
in
terror.
I
feared
the
man
meant
to
use
me
as
I
had
heard
men
used
small
boys,
but
in
truth
the
only
part
of
me
he
had
need
of
was
my
manhood.
He
gave
me
a
potion
that
made
me
powerless
to
move
or
speak,
yet
did
nothing
to
dull
my
senses.
With
a
long
hooked
blade,
he
sliced
me
root
and
stem,
chanting
all
the
while.
I
watched
him
burn
my
manly
parts
on
a
brazier.
The
flames
turned
blue,
and
I
heard
a
voice
answer
his
call,
though
I
did
not
understand
the
words
they
spoke.

вЂњThe
mummers
had
sailed
by
the
time
he
was
done
with
me.
Once
I
had
served
his
purpose,
the
man
had
no
further
interest
in
me,
so
he
put
me
out.
When
I
asked
him
what
I
should
do
now,
he
answered
that
he
supposed
I
should
die.
To
spite
him,
I
resolved
to
live.
I
begged,
I
stole,
and
I
sold
what
parts
of
my
body
still
remained
to
me.
Soon
I
was
as
good
a
thief
as
any
in
Myr,
and
when
I
was
older
I
learned
that
often
the
contents
of
a
manвЂ™s
letters
are
more
valuable
than
the
contents
of
his
purse.

вЂњYet
I
still
dream
of
that
night,
my
lord.
Not
of
the
sorcerer,
nor
his
blade,
nor
even
the
way
my
manhood
shriveled
as
it
burned.
I
dream
of
the
voice.
The
voice
from
the
flames.
Was
it
a
god,
a
demon,
some
conjurerвЂ™s
trick?
I
could
not
tell
you,
and
I
know
all
the
tricks.
All
I
can
say
for
a
certainty
is
that
he
called
it,
and
it
answered,
and
since
that
day
I
have
hated
magic
and
all
those
who
practice
it.
If
Lord
Stannis
is
one
such,
I
mean
to
see
him
dead.вЂќ

When
he
was
done,
they
rode
in
silence
for
a
time.
Finally
Tyrion
said,
вЂњA
harrowing
tale.
IвЂ™m
sorry.вЂќ

The
eunuch
sighed.
вЂњYou
are
sorry,
but
you
do
not
believe
me.
No,
my
lord,
no
need
to
apologize.
I
was
drugged
and
in
pain
and
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
and
far
across
the
sea.
No
doubt
I
dreamed
that
voice.
IвЂ™ve
told
myself
as
much
a
thousand
times.вЂќ

вЂњI
believe
in
steel
swords,
gold
coins,
and
menвЂ™s
wits,вЂќ
said
Tyrion.
вЂњAnd
I
believe
there
once
were
dragons.
IвЂ™ve
seen
their
skulls,
after
all.вЂќ

вЂњLet
us
hope
that
is
the
worst
thing
you
ever
see,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњOn
that
we
agree.вЂќ
Tyrion
smiled.
вЂњAnd
for
Ser
CortnayвЂ™s
death,
well,
we
know
Stannis
hired
sellsails
from
the
Free
Cities.
Perhaps
he
bought
himself
a
skilled
assassin
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњA
very
skilled
assassin.вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
such.
I
used
to
dream
that
one
day
IвЂ™d
be
rich
enough
to
send
a
Faceless
Man
after
my
sweet
sister.вЂќ

вЂњRegardless
of
how
Ser
Cortnay
died,вЂќ
said
Varys,
вЂњhe
is
dead,
the
castle
fallen.
Stannis
is
free
to
march.вЂќ

вЂњAny
chance
we
might
convince
the
Dornishmen
to
descend
on
the
Marches?вЂќ
asked
Tyrion.

вЂњNone.вЂќ

вЂњA
pity.
Well,
the
threat
may
serve
to
keep
the
Marcher
lords
close
to
their
castles,
at
least.
What
news
of
my
father?вЂќ

вЂњIf
Lord
Tywin
has
won
across
the
Red
Fork,
no
word
has
reached
me
yet.
If
he
does
not
hasten,
he
may
be
trapped
between
his
foes.
The
Oakheart
leaf
and
the
Rowan
tree
have
been
seen
north
of
the
Mander.вЂќ

вЂњNo
word
from
Littlefinger?вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps
he
never
reached
Bitterbridge.
Or
perhaps
heвЂ™s
died
there.
Lord
Tarly
has
seized
RenlyвЂ™s
stores
and
put
a
great
many
to
the
sword;
Florents,
chiefly.
Lord
Caswell
has
shut
himself
up
in
his
castle.вЂќ

Tyrion
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed.

Varys
reined
up,
nonplussed.
вЂњMy
lord?вЂќ

вЂњDonвЂ™t
you
see
the
jest,
Lord
Varys?вЂќ
Tyrion
waved
a
hand
at
the
shuttered
windows,
at
all
the
sleeping
city.
вЂњStormвЂ™s
End
is
fallen
and
Stannis
is
coming
with
fire
and
steel
and
the
gods
alone
know
what
dark
powers,
and
the
good
folk
donвЂ™t
have
Jaime
to
protect
them,
nor
Robert
nor
Renly
nor
Rhaegar
nor
their
precious
Knight
of
Flowers.
Only
me,
the
one
they
hate.вЂќ
He
laughed
again.
вЂњThe
dwarf,
the
evil
counselor,
the
twisted
little
monkey
demon.
IвЂ™m
all
that
stands
between
them
and
chaos.вЂќ





CATELYN

вЂњTell
Father
I
have
gone
to
make
him
proud.вЂќ
Her
brother
swung
up
into
his
saddle,
every
inch
the
lord
in
his
bright
mail
and
flowing
mud-and-water
cloak.
A
silver
trout
ornamented
the
crest
of
his
greathelm,
twin
to
the
one
painted
on
his
shield.

вЂњHe
was
always
proud
of
you,
Edmure.
And
he
loves
you
fiercely.
Believe
that.вЂќ

вЂњI
mean
to
give
him
better
reason
than
mere
birth.вЂќ
He
wheeled
his
warhorse
about
and
raised
a
hand.
Trumpets
sounded,
a
drum
began
to
boom,
the
drawbridge
descended
in
fits
and
starts,
and
Ser
Edmure
Tully
led
his
men
out
from
Riverrun
with
lances
raised
and
banners
streaming.

I
have
a
greater
host
than
yours,
brother,
Catelyn
thought
as
she
watched
them
go.
A
host
of
doubts
and
fears.

Beside
her,
BrienneвЂ™s
misery
was
almost
palpable.
Catelyn
had
ordered
garments
sewn
to
her
measure,
handsome
gowns
to
suit
her
birth
and
sex,
yet
still
she
preferred
to
dress
in
oddments
of
mail
and
boiled
leather,
a
swordbelt
cinched
around
her
waist.
She
would
have
been
happier
riding
to
war
with
Edmure,
no
doubt,
but
even
walls
as
strong
as
RiverrunвЂ™s
required
swords
to
hold
them.
Her
brother
had
taken
every
able-bodied
man
for
the
fords,
leaving
Ser
Desmond
Grell
to
command
a
garrison
made
up
of
the
wounded,
the
old,
and
the
sick,
along
with
a
few
squires
and
some
untrained
peasant
boys
still
shy
of
manhood.
This,
to
defend
a
castle
crammed
full
of
women
and
children.

When
the
last
of
EdmureвЂ™s
foot
had
shuffled
under
the
portcullis,
Brienne
asked,
вЂњWhat
shall
we
do
now,
my
lady?вЂќ

вЂњOur
duty.вЂќ
CatelynвЂ™s
face
was
drawn
as
she
started
across
the
yard.
I
have
always
done
my
duty,
she
thought.
Perhaps
that
was
why
her
lord
father
had
always
cherished
her
best
of
all
his
children.
Her
two
older
brothers
had
both
died
in
infancy,
so
she
had
been
son
as
well
as
daughter
to
Lord
Hoster
until
Edmure
was
born.
Then
her
mother
had
died
and
her
father
had
told
her
that
she
must
be
the
lady
of
Riverrun
now,
and
she
had
done
that
too.
And
when
Lord
Hoster
promised
her
to
Brandon
Stark,
she
had
thanked
him
for
making
her
such
a
splendid
match.

I
gave
Brandon
my
favor
to
wear,
and
never
comforted
Petyr
once
after
he
was
wounded,
nor
bid
him
farewell
when
Father
sent
him
off.
And
when
Brandon
was
murdered
and
Father
told
me
I
must
wed
his
brother,
I
did
so
gladly,
though
I
never
saw
NedвЂ™s
face
until
our
wedding
day.
I
gave
my
maidenhood
to
this
solemn
stranger
and
sent
him
off
to
his
war
and
his
king
and
the
woman
who
bore
him
his
bastard,
because
I
always
did
my
duty.

Her
steps
took
her
to
the
sept,
a
seven-sided
sandstone
temple
set
amidst
her
motherвЂ™s
gardens
and
filled
with
rainbow
light.
It
was
crowded
when
they
entered;
Catelyn
was
not
alone
in
her
need
for
prayer.
She
knelt
before
the
painted
marble
image
of
the
Warrior
and
lit
a
scented
candle
for
Edmure
and
another
for
Robb
off
beyond
the
hills.
Keep
them
safe
and
help
them
to
victory,
she
prayed,
and
bring
peace
to
the
souls
of
the
slain
and
comfort
to
those
they
leave
behind.

The
septon
entered
with
his
censer
and
crystal
while
she
was
at
her
prayers,
so
Catelyn
lingered
for
the
celebration.
She
did
not
know
this
septon,
an
earnest
young
man
close
to
EdmureвЂ™s
age.
He
performed
his
office
well
enough,
and
his
voice
was
rich
and
pleasant
when
he
sang
the
praises
to
the
Seven,
but
Catelyn
found
herself
yearning
for
the
thin
quavering
tones
of
Septon
Osmynd,
long
dead.
Osmynd
would
have
listened
patiently
to
the
tale
of
what
she
had
seen
and
felt
in
RenlyвЂ™s
pavilion,
and
he
might
have
known
what
it
meant
as
well,
and
what
she
must
do
to
lay
to
rest
the
shadows
that
stalked
her
dreams.
Osmynd,
my
father,
Uncle
Brynden,
old
Maester
Kym,
they
always
seemed
to
know
everything,
but
now
there
is
only
me,
and
it
seems
I
know
nothing,
not
even
my
duty.
How
can
I
do
my
duty
if
I
do
not
know
where
it
lies?

CatelynвЂ™s
knees
were
stiff
by
the
time
she
rose,
though
she
felt
no
wiser.
Perhaps
she
would
go
to
the
godswood
tonight,
and
pray
to
NedвЂ™s
gods
as
well.
They
were
older
than
the
Seven.

Outside,
she
found
song
of
a
very
different
sort.
Rymund
the
Rhymer
sat
by
the
brewhouse
amidst
a
circle
of
listeners,
his
deep
voice
ringing
as
he
sang
of
Lord
Deremond
at
the
Bloody
Meadow.

And
there
he
stood
with
sword
in
hand,

the
last
of
DarryвЂ™s
tenвЂ¦

Brienne
paused
to
listen
for
a
moment,
broad
shoulders
hunched
and
thick
arms
crossed
against
her
chest.
A
mob
of
ragged
boys
raced
by,
screeching
and
flailing
at
each
other
with
sticks.
Why
do
boys
so
love
to
play
at
war?
Catelyn
wondered
if
Rymund
was
the
answer.
The
singerвЂ™s
voice
swelled
as
he
neared
the
end
of
his
song.

And
red
the
grass
beneath
his
feet,

and
red
his
banners
bright,

and
red
the
glow
of
setting
sun

that
bathed
him
in
its
light.

вЂњCome
on,
come
on,вЂќ
the
great
lord
called,

вЂњmy
sword
is
hungry
still.вЂќ

And
with
a
cry
of
savage
rage,

They
swarmed
across
the
rillвЂ¦

вЂњFighting
is
better
than
this
waiting,вЂќ
Brienne
said.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
feel
so
helpless
when
you
fight.
You
have
a
sword
and
a
horse,
sometimes
an
axe.
When
youвЂ™re
armored
itвЂ™s
hard
for
anyone
to
hurt
you.вЂќ

вЂњKnights
die
in
battle,вЂќ
Catelyn
reminded
her.

Brienne
looked
at
her
with
those
blue
and
beautiful
eyes.
вЂњAs
ladies
die
in
childbed.
No
one
sings
songs
about
them.вЂќ

вЂњChildren
are
a
battle
of
a
different
sort.вЂќ
Catelyn
started
across
the
yard.
вЂњA
battle
without
banners
or
warhorns,
but
no
less
fierce.
Carrying
a
child,
bringing
it
into
the
worldвЂ¦
your
mother
will
have
told
you
of
the
painвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
never
knew
my
mother,вЂќ
Brienne
said.
вЂњMy
father
had
ladiesвЂ¦
a
different
lady
every
year,
butвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThose
were
no
ladies,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњAs
hard
as
birth
can
be,
Brienne,
what
comes
after
is
even
harder.
At
times
I
feel
as
though
I
am
being
torn
apart.
Would
that
there
were
five
of
me,
one
for
each
child,
so
I
might
keep
them
all
safe.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
who
would
keep
you
safe,
my
lady?вЂќ

Her
smile
was
wan
and
tired.
вЂњWhy,
the
men
of
my
House.
Or
so
my
lady
mother
taught
me.
My
lord
father,
my
brother,
my
uncle,
my
husband,
they
will
keep
me
safeвЂ¦
but
while
they
are
away
from
me,
I
suppose
you
must
fill
their
place,
Brienne.вЂќ

Brienne
bowed
her
head.
вЂњI
shall
try,
my
lady.вЂќ

Later
that
day,
Maester
Vyman
brought
a
letter.
She
saw
him
at
once,
hoping
for
some
word
from
Robb,
or
from
Ser
Rodrik
in
Winterfell,
but
the
message
proved
to
be
from
one
Lord
Meadows,
who
named
himself
castellan
of
StormвЂ™s
End.
It
was
addressed
to
her
father,
her
brother,
her
son,
вЂњor
whoever
now
holds
Riverrun.вЂќ
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
was
dead,
the
man
wrote,
and
StormвЂ™s
End
had
opened
its
gate
to
Stannis
Baratheon,
the
trueborn
and
rightful
heir.
The
castle
garrison
had
sworn
their
swords
to
his
cause,
one
and
all,
and
no
man
of
them
had
suffered
harm.

вЂњSave
Cortnay
Penrose,вЂќ
Catelyn
murmured.
She
had
never
met
the
man,
yet
she
grieved
to
hear
of
his
passing.
вЂњRobb
should
know
of
this
at
once,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњDo
we
know
where
he
is?вЂќ

вЂњAt
last
word
he
was
marching
toward
the
Crag,
the
seat
of
House
Westerling,вЂќ
said
Maester
Vyman.
вЂњIf
I
dispatched
a
raven
to
Ashemark,
it
may
be
that
they
could
send
a
rider
after
him.вЂќ

вЂњDo
so.вЂќ

Catelyn
read
the
letter
again
after
the
maester
was
gone.
вЂњLord
Meadows
says
nothing
of
RobertвЂ™s
bastard,вЂќ
she
confided
to
Brienne.
вЂњI
suppose
he
yielded
the
boy
with
the
rest,
though
I
confess,
I
do
not
understand
why
Stannis
wanted
him
so
badly.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps
he
fears
the
boyвЂ™s
claim.вЂќ

вЂњA
bastardвЂ™s
claim?
No,
itвЂ™s
something
elseвЂ¦
what
does
this
child
look
like?вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
seven
or
eight,
comely,
with
black
hair
and
bright
blue
eyes.
Visitors
oft
thought
him
Lord
RenlyвЂ™s
own
son.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Renly
favored
Robert.вЂќ
Catelyn
had
a
glimmer
of
understanding.
вЂњStannis
means
to
parade
his
brotherвЂ™s
bastard
before
the
realm,
so
men
might
see
Robert
in
his
face
and
wonder
why
there
is
no
such
likeness
in
Joffrey.вЂќ

вЂњWould
that
mean
so
much?вЂќ

вЂњThose
who
favor
Stannis
will
call
it
proof.
Those
who
support
Joffrey
will
say
it
means
nothing.вЂќ
Her
own
children
had
more
Tully
about
them
than
Stark.
Arya
was
the
only
one
to
show
much
of
Ned
in
her
features.
And
Jon
Snow,
but
he
was
never
mine.
She
found
herself
thinking
of
JonвЂ™s
mother,
that
shadowy
secret
love
her
husband
would
never
speak
of.
Does
she
grieve
for
Ned
as
I
do?
Or
did
she
hate
him
for
leaving
her
bed
for
mine?
Does
she
pray
for
her
son
as
I
have
prayed
for
mine?

They
were
uncomfortable
thoughts,
and
futile.
If
Jon
had
been
born
of
Ashara
Dayne
of
Starfall,
as
some
whispered,
the
lady
was
long
dead;
if
not,
Catelyn
had
no
clue
who
or
where
his
mother
might
be.
And
it
made
no
matter.
Ned
was
gone
now,
and
his
loves
and
his
secrets
had
all
died
with
him.

Still,
she
was
struck
again
by
how
strangely
men
behaved
when
it
came
to
their
bastards.
Ned
had
always
been
fiercely
protective
of
Jon,
and
Ser
Cortnay
Penrose
had
given
up
his
life
for
this
Edric
Storm,
yet
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
bastard
had
meant
less
to
him
than
one
of
his
dogs,
to
judge
from
the
tone
of
the
queer
cold
letter
Edmure
had
gotten
from
him
not
three
days
past.
He
had
crossed
the
Trident
and
was
marching
on
Harrenhal
as
commanded,
he
wrote.
вЂњA
strong
castle,
and
well
garrisoned,
but
His
Grace
shall
have
it,
if
I
must
kill
every
living
soul
within
to
make
it
so.вЂќ
He
hoped
His
Grace
would
weigh
that
against
the
crimes
of
his
bastard
son,
whom
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
had
put
to
death.
вЂњA
fate
he
no
doubt
earned,вЂќ
Bolton
had
written.
вЂњTainted
blood
is
ever
treacherous,
and
RamsayвЂ™s
nature
was
sly,
greedy,
and
cruel.
I
count
myself
well
rid
of
him.
The
trueborn
sons
my
young
wife
has
promised
me
would
never
have
been
safe
while
he
lived.вЂќ

The
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
drove
the
morbid
thoughts
from
her
head.
Ser
DesmondвЂ™s
squire
dashed
panting
into
the
room
and
knelt.
вЂњMy
ladyвЂ¦
LannistersвЂ¦
across
the
river.вЂќ

вЂњTake
a
long
breath,
lad,
and
tell
it
slowly.вЂќ

He
did
as
she
bid
him.
вЂњA
column
of
armored
men,вЂќ
he
reported.
вЂњAcross
the
Red
Fork.
They
are
flying
a
purple
unicorn
below
the
lion
of
Lannister.вЂќ

Some
son
of
Lord
Brax.
Brax
had
come
to
Riverrun
once
when
she
was
a
girl,
to
propose
wedding
one
of
his
sons
to
her
or
Lysa.
She
wondered
whether
it
was
this
same
son
out
there
now,
leading
the
attack.

The
Lannisters
had
ridden
out
of
the
southeast
beneath
a
blaze
of
banners,
Ser
Desmond
told
her
when
she
ascended
to
the
battlements
to
join
him.
вЂњA
few
outriders,
no
more,вЂќ
he
assured
her.
вЂњThe
main
strength
of
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
host
is
well
to
the
south.
We
are
in
no
danger
here.вЂќ

South
of
the
Red
Fork
the
land
stretched
away
open
and
flat.
From
the
watchtower
Catelyn
could
see
for
miles.
Even
so,
only
the
nearest
ford
was
visible.
Edmure
had
entrusted
Lord
Jason
Mallister
with
its
defense,
as
well
as
that
of
three
others
farther
upriver.
The
Lannister
riders
were
milling
about
uncertainly
near
the
water,
crimson
and
silver
banners
flapping
in
the
wind.
вЂњNo
more
than
fifty,
my
lady,вЂќ
Ser
Desmond
estimated.

Catelyn
watched
the
riders
spread
out
in
a
long
line.
Lord
JasonвЂ™s
men
waited
to
receive
them
behind
rocks
and
grass
and
hillocks.
A
trumpet
blast
sent
the
horsemen
forward
at
a
ponderous
walk,
splashing
down
into
the
current.
For
a
moment
they
made
a
brave
show,
all
bright
armor
and
streaming
banners,
the
sun
flashing
off
the
points
of
their
lances.

вЂњNow,вЂќ
she
heard
Brienne
mutter.

It
was
hard
to
make
out
what
was
happening,
but
the
screams
of
the
horses
seemed
loud
even
at
this
remove,
and
beneath
them
Catelyn
heard
the
fainter
clash
of
steel
on
steel.
A
banner
vanished
suddenly
as
its
bearer
was
swept
under,
and
soon
after
the
first
dead
man
drifted
past
their
walls,
borne
along
by
the
current.
By
then
the
Lannisters
had
pulled
back
in
confusion.
She
watched
as
they
re-formed,
conferred
briefly,
and
galloped
back
the
way
they
had
come.
The
men
on
the
walls
shouted
taunts
after
them,
though
they
were
already
too
far
off
to
hear.

Ser
Desmond
slapped
his
belly.
вЂњWould
that
Lord
Hoster
could
have
seen
that.
It
would
have
made
him
dance.вЂќ

вЂњMy
fatherвЂ™s
dancing
days
are
past,
I
fear,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
вЂњand
this
fight
is
just
begun.
The
Lannisters
will
come
again.
Lord
Tywin
has
twice
my
brotherвЂ™s
numbers.вЂќ

вЂњHe
could
have
ten
times
and
it
would
not
matter,вЂќ
Ser
Desmond
said.
вЂњThe
west
bank
of
the
Red
Fork
is
higher
than
the
east,
my
lady,
and
well
wooded.
Our
bowmen
have
good
cover,
and
a
clear
field
for
their
shaftsвЂ¦
and
should
any
breach
occur,
Edmure
will
have
his
best
knights
in
reserve,
ready
to
ride
wherever
they
are
most
sorely
needed.
The
river
will
hold
them.вЂќ

вЂњI
pray
that
you
are
right,вЂќ
Catelyn
said
gravely.

That
night
they
came
again.
She
had
commanded
them
to
wake
her
at
once
if
the
enemy
returned,
and
well
after
midnight
a
serving
girl
touched
her
gently
by
the
shoulder.
Catelyn
sat
up
at
once.
вЂњWhat
is
it?вЂќ

вЂњThe
ford
again,
my
lady.вЂќ

Wrapped
in
a
bedrobe,
Catelyn
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
keep.
From
there
she
could
see
over
the
walls
and
the
moonlit
river
to
where
the
battle
raged.
The
defenders
had
built
watchfires
along
the
bank,
and
perhaps
the
Lannisters
thought
to
find
them
night-blind
or
unwary.
If
so,
it
was
folly.
Darkness
was
a
chancy
ally
at
best.
As
they
waded
in
to
breast
their
way
across,
men
stepped
in
hidden
pools
and
went
down
splashing,
while
others
stumbled
over
stones
or
gashed
their
feet
on
the
hidden
caltrops.
The
Mallister
bowmen
sent
a
storm
of
fire
arrows
hissing
across
the
river,
strangely
beautiful
from
afar.
One
man,
pierced
through
a
dozen
times,
his
clothes
afire,
danced
and
whirled
in
the
knee-deep
water
until
at
last
he
fell
and
was
swept
downstream.
By
the
time
his
body
came
bobbing
past
Riverrun,
the
fires
and
his
life
had
both
been
extinguished.

A
small
victory,
Catelyn
thought
when
the
fighting
had
ended
and
the
surviving
foemen
had
melted
back
into
the
night,
yet
a
victory
nonetheless.
As
they
descended
the
winding
turret
steps,
Catelyn
asked
Brienne
for
her
thoughts.
вЂњThat
was
the
brush
of
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
fingertip,
my
lady,вЂќ
the
girl
said.
вЂњHe
is
probing,
feeling
for
a
weak
point,
an
undefended
crossing.
If
he
does
not
find
one,
he
will
curl
all
his
fingers
into
a
fist
and
try
and
make
one.вЂќ
Brienne
hunched
her
shoulders.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
what
IвЂ™d
do.
Were
I
him.вЂќ
Her
hand
went
to
the
hilt
of
her
sword
and
gave
it
a
little
pat,
as
if
to
make
certain
it
was
still
there.

And
may
the
gods
help
us
then,
Catelyn
thought.
Yet
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
it.
That
was
EdmureвЂ™s
battle
out
there
on
the
river;
hers
was
here
inside
the
castle.

The
next
morning
as
she
broke
her
fast,
she
sent
for
her
fatherвЂ™s
aged
steward,
Utherydes
Wayn.
вЂњHave
Ser
Cleos
Frey
brought
a
flagon
of
wine.
I
mean
to
question
him
soon,
and
I
want
his
tongue
well
loosened.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
command,
my
lady.вЂќ

Not
long
after,
a
rider
with
the
Mallister
eagle
sewn
on
his
breast
arrived
with
a
message
from
Lord
Jason,
telling
of
another
skirmish
and
another
victory.
Ser
Flement
Brax
had
tried
to
force
a
crossing
at
a
different
ford
six
leagues
to
the
south.
This
time
the
Lannisters
shortened
their
lances
and
advanced
across
the
river
behind
on
foot,
but
the
Mallister
bowmen
had
rained
high
arcing
shots
down
over
their
shields,
while
the
scorpions
Edmure
had
mounted
on
the
riverbank
sent
heavy
stones
crashing
through
to
break
up
the
formation.
вЂњThey
left
a
dozen
dead
in
the
water,
only
two
reaching
the
shallows,
where
we
dealt
with
them
briskly,вЂќ
the
rider
reported.
He
also
told
of
fighting
farther
upstream,
where
Lord
Karyl
Vance
held
the
fords.
вЂњThose
thrusts
too
were
turned
aside,
at
grievous
cost
to
our
foes.вЂќ

Perhaps
Edmure
was
wiser
than
I
knew,
Catelyn
thought.
His
lords
all
saw
the
sense
in
his
battle
plans,
why
was
I
so
blind?
My
brother
is
not
the
little
boy
I
remember,
no
more
than
Robb
is.

She
waited
until
evening
before
going
to
pay
her
call
upon
Ser
Cleos
Frey,
reasoning
that
the
longer
she
delayed,
the
drunker
he
was
likely
to
be.
As
she
entered
the
tower
cell,
Ser
Cleos
stumbled
to
his
knees.
вЂњMy
lady,
I
knew
naught
of
any
escape.
The
Imp
said
a
Lannister
must
needs
have
a
Lannister
escort,
on
my
oath
as
a
knightвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњArise,
ser.вЂќ
Catelyn
seated
herself.
вЂњI
know
no
grandson
of
Walder
Frey
would
be
an
oathbreaker.вЂќ
Unless
it
served
his
purpose.
вЂњYou
brought
peace
terms,
my
brother
said.вЂќ

вЂњI
did.вЂќ
Ser
Cleos
lurched
to
his
feet.
She
was
pleased
to
see
how
unsteady
he
was.

вЂњTell
me,вЂќ
she
commanded,
and
he
did.

When
he
was
done,
Catelyn
sat
frowning.
Edmure
had
been
right,
these
were
no
terms
at
all,
exceptвЂ¦вЂњLannister
will
exchange
Arya
and
Sansa
for
his
brother?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
He
sat
on
the
Iron
Throne
and
swore
it.вЂќ

вЂњBefore
witnesses?вЂќ

вЂњBefore
all
the
court,
my
lady.
And
the
gods
as
well.
I
said
as
much
to
Ser
Edmure,
but
he
told
me
it
was
not
possible,
that
His
Grace
Robb
would
never
consent.вЂќ

вЂњHe
told
you
true.вЂќ
She
could
not
even
say
that
Robb
was
wrong.
Arya
and
Sansa
were
children.
The
Kingslayer,
alive
and
free,
was
as
dangerous
as
any
man
in
the
realm.
That
road
led
nowhere.
вЂњDid
you
see
my
girls?
Are
they
treated
well?вЂќ

Ser
Cleos
hesitated.
вЂњIвЂ¦
yes,
they
seemedвЂ¦вЂќ

He
is
fumbling
for
a
lie,
Catelyn
realized,
but
the
wine
has
fuddled
his
wits.
вЂњSer
Cleos,вЂќ
she
said
coolly,
вЂњyou
forfeited
the
protection
of
your
peace
banner
when
your
men
played
us
false.
Lie
to
me,
and
youвЂ™ll
hang
from
the
walls
beside
them.
Believe
that.
I
shall
ask
you
once
moreвЂ”did
you
see
my
daughters?вЂќ

His
brow
was
damp
with
sweat.
вЂњI
saw
Sansa
at
the
court,
the
day
Tyrion
told
me
his
terms.
She
looked
most
beautiful,
my
lady.
Perhaps
a,
a
bit
wan.
Drawn,
as
it
were.вЂќ

Sansa,
but
not
Arya.
That
might
mean
anything.
Arya
had
always
been
harder
to
tame.
Perhaps
Cersei
was
reluctant
to
parade
her
in
open
court
for
fear
of
what
she
might
say
or
do.
They
might
have
her
locked
safely
out
of
sight.
Or
they
might
have
killed
her.
Catelyn
shoved
the
thought
away.
вЂњHis
terms,
you
saidвЂ¦
yet
Cersei
is
Queen
Regent.вЂќ

вЂњTyrion
spoke
for
both
of
them.
The
queen
was
not
there.
She
was
indisposed
that
day,
I
was
told.вЂќ

вЂњCurious.вЂќ
Catelyn
thought
back
to
that
terrible
trek
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
and
the
way
Tyrion
Lannister
had
somehow
seduced
that
sellsword
from
her
service
to
his
own.
The
dwarf
is
too
clever
by
half.
She
could
not
imagine
how
he
had
survived
the
high
road
after
Lysa
had
sent
him
from
the
Vale,
yet
it
did
not
surprise
her.
He
had
no
part
in
NedвЂ™s
murder,
at
the
least.
And
he
came
to
my
defense
when
the
clansmen
attacked
us.
If
I
could
trust
his
wordвЂ¦

She
opened
her
hands
to
look
down
at
the
scars
across
her
fingers.
His
daggerвЂ™s
marks,
she
reminded
herself.
His
dagger,
in
the
hand
of
the
killer
he
paid
to
open
BranвЂ™s
throat.
Though
the
dwarf
denied
it,
to
be
sure.
Even
after
Lysa
locked
him
in
one
of
her
sky
cells
and
threatened
him
with
her
moon
door,
he
had
still
denied
it.
вЂњHe
lied,вЂќ
she
said,
rising
abruptly.
вЂњThe
Lannisters
are
liars
every
one,
and
the
dwarf
is
the
worst
of
them.
The
killer
was
armed
with
his
own
knife.вЂќ

Ser
Cleos
stared.
вЂњI
know
nothing
of
anyвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
nothing,вЂќ
she
agreed,
sweeping
from
the
cell.
Brienne
fell
in
beside
her,
silent.
It
is
simpler
for
her,
Catelyn
thought
with
a
pang
of
envy.
She
was
like
a
man
in
that.
For
men
the
answer
was
always
the
same,
and
never
farther
away
than
the
nearest
sword.
For
a
woman,
a
mother,
the
way
was
stonier
and
harder
to
know.

She
took
a
late
supper
in
the
Great
Hall
with
her
garrison,
to
give
them
what
encouragement
she
could.
Rymund
the
Rhymer
sang
through
all
the
courses,
sparing
her
the
need
to
talk.
He
closed
with
the
song
he
had
written
about
RobbвЂ™s
victory
at
Oxcross.
вЂњAnd
the
stars
in
the
night
were
the
eyes
of
his
wolves,
and
the
wind
itself
was
their
song.вЂќ
Between
the
verses,
Rymund
threw
back
his
head
and
howled,
and
by
the
end,
half
of
the
hall
was
howling
along
with
him,
even
Desmond
Grell,
who
was
well
in
his
cups.
Their
voices
rang
off
the
rafters.

Let
them
have
their
songs,
if
it
makes
them
brave,
Catelyn
thought,
toying
with
her
silver
goblet.

вЂњThere
was
always
a
singer
at
Evenfall
Hall
when
I
was
a
girl,вЂќ
Brienne
said
quietly.
вЂњI
learned
all
the
songs
by
heart.вЂќ

вЂњSansa
did
the
same,
though
few
singers
ever
cared
to
make
the
long
journey
north
to
Winterfell.вЂќ
I
told
her
there
would
be
singers
at
the
kingвЂ™s
court,
though.
I
told
her
she
would
hear
music
of
all
sorts,
that
her
father
could
find
some
master
to
help
her
learn
the
high
harp.
Oh,
gods
forgive
meвЂ¦

Brienne
said,
вЂњI
remember
a
womanвЂ¦
she
came
from
some
place
across
the
narrow
sea.
I
could
not
even
say
what
language
she
sang
in,
but
her
voice
was
as
lovely
as
she
was.
She
had
eyes
the
color
of
plums
and
her
waist
was
so
tiny
my
father
could
put
his
hands
around
it.
His
hands
were
almost
as
big
as
mine.вЂќ
She
closed
her
long,
thick
fingers,
as
if
to
hide
them.

вЂњDid
you
sing
for
your
father?вЂќ
Catelyn
asked.

Brienne
shook
her
head,
staring
down
at
her
trencher
as
if
to
find
some
answer
in
the
gravy.

вЂњFor
Lord
Renly?вЂќ

The
girl
reddened.
вЂњNever,
IвЂ¦
his
fool,
he
made
cruel
japes
sometimes,
and
IвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSomeday
you
must
sing
for
me.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ¦
please,
I
have
no
gift.вЂќ
Brienne
pushed
back
from
the
table.
вЂњForgive
me,
my
lady.
Do
I
have
your
leave
to
go?вЂќ

Catelyn
nodded.
The
tall,
ungainly
girl
left
the
hall
with
long
strides,
almost
unnoticed
amidst
the
revelry.
May
the
gods
go
with
her,
she
thought
as
she
returned
listlessly
to
her
supper.

It
was
three
days
later
when
the
hammer
blow
that
Brienne
had
foretold
fell,
and
five
days
before
they
heard
of
it.
Catelyn
was
sitting
with
her
father
when
EdmureвЂ™s
messenger
arrived.
The
manвЂ™s
armor
was
dinted,
his
boots
dusty,
and
he
had
a
ragged
hole
in
his
surcoat,
but
the
look
on
his
face
as
he
knelt
was
enough
to
tell
her
that
the
news
was
good.
вЂњVictory,
my
lady.вЂќ
He
handed
her
EdmureвЂ™s
letter.
Her
hand
trembled
as
she
broke
the
seal.

Lord
Tywin
had
tried
to
force
a
crossing
at
a
dozen
different
fords,
her
brother
wrote,
but
every
thrust
had
been
thrown
back.
Lord
Lefford
had
been
drowned,
the
Crakehall
knight
called
Strongboar
taken
captive,
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
thrice
forced
to
retreatвЂ¦
but
the
fiercest
battle
had
been
fought
at
Stone
Mill,
where
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
had
led
the
assault.
So
many
of
his
men
had
fallen
that
their
dead
horses
threatened
to
dam
the
flow.
In
the
end
the
Mountain
and
a
handful
of
his
best
had
gained
the
west
bank,
but
Edmure
had
thrown
his
reserve
at
them,
and
they
had
shattered
and
reeled
away
bloody
and
beaten.
Ser
Gregor
himself
had
lost
his
horse
and
staggered
back
across
the
Red
Fork
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds
while
a
rain
of
arrows
and
stones
fell
all
around
him.
вЂњThey
shall
not
cross,
Cat,вЂќ
Edmure
scrawled,
вЂњLord
Tywin
is
marching
to
the
southeast.
A
feint
perhaps,
or
full
retreat,
it
matters
not.
They
shall
not
cross.вЂќ

Ser
Desmond
Grell
had
been
elated.
вЂњOh,
if
only
I
might
have
been
with
him,вЂќ
the
old
knight
said
when
she
read
him
the
letter.
вЂњWhere
is
that
fool
Rymund?
ThereвЂ™s
a
song
in
this,
by
the
gods,
and
one
that
even
Edmure
will
want
to
hear.
The
mill
that
ground
the
Mountain
down,
I
could
almost
make
the
words
myself,
had
I
the
singerвЂ™s
gift.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
hear
no
songs
until
the
fightingвЂ™s
done,вЂќ
Catelyn
said,
perhaps
too
sharply.
Yet
she
allowed
Ser
Desmond
to
spread
the
word,
and
agreed
when
he
suggested
breaking
open
some
casks
in
honor
of
Stone
Mill.
The
mood
within
Riverrun
had
been
strained
and
somber;
they
would
all
be
better
for
a
little
drink
and
hope.

That
night
the
castle
rang
to
the
sounds
of
celebration.
вЂњRiverrun!вЂќ
the
smallfolk
shouted,
and
вЂњTully!
Tully!вЂќ
TheyвЂ™d
come
frightened
and
helpless,
and
her
brother
had
taken
them
in
when
most
lords
would
have
closed
their
gates.
Their
voices
floated
in
through
the
high
windows,
and
seeped
under
the
heavy
redwood
doors.
Rymund
played
his
harp,
accompanied
by
a
pair
of
drummers
and
a
youth
with
a
set
of
reed
pipes.
Catelyn
listened
to
girlish
laughter,
and
the
excited
chatter
of
the
green
boys
her
brother
had
left
her
for
a
garrison.
Good
soundsвЂ¦
and
yet
they
did
not
touch
her.
She
could
not
share
their
happiness.

In
her
fatherвЂ™s
solar
she
found
a
heavy
leatherbound
book
of
maps
and
opened
it
to
the
riverlands.
Her
eyes
found
the
path
of
the
Red
Fork
and
traced
it
by
flickering
candlelight.
Marching
to
the
southeast,
she
thought.
By
now
they
had
likely
reached
the
headwaters
of
the
Blackwater
Rush,
she
decided.

She
closed
the
book
even
more
uneasy
than
before.
The
gods
had
granted
them
victory
after
victory.
At
Stone
Mill,
at
Oxcross,
in
the
Battle
of
the
Camps,
at
the
Whispering
WoodвЂ¦

But
if
we
are
winning,
why
am
I
so
afraid?





BRAN

The
sound
was
the
faintest
of
clinks,
a
scraping
of
steel
over
stone.
He
lifted
his
head
from
his
paws,
listening,
sniffing
at
the
night.

The
eveningвЂ™s
rain
had
woken
a
hundred
sleeping
smells
and
made
them
ripe
and
strong
again.
Grass
and
thorns,
blackberries
broken
on
the
ground,
mud,
worms,
rotting
leaves,
a
rat
creeping
through
the
bush.
He
caught
the
shaggy
black
scent
of
his
brotherвЂ™s
coat
and
the
sharp
coppery
tang
of
blood
from
the
squirrel
heвЂ™d
killed.
Other
squirrels
moved
through
the
branches
above,
smelling
of
wet
fur
and
fear,
their
little
claws
scratching
at
the
bark.
The
noise
had
sounded
something
like
that.

And
he
heard
it
again,
clink
and
scrape.
It
brought
him
to
his
feet.
His
ears
pricked
and
his
tail
rose.
He
howled,
a
long
deep
shivery
cry,
a
howl
to
wake
the
sleepers,
but
the
piles
of
man-rock
were
dark
and
dead.
A
still
wet
night,
a
night
to
drive
men
into
their
holes.
The
rain
had
stopped,
but
the
men
still
hid
from
the
damp,
huddled
by
the
fires
in
their
caves
of
piled
stone.

His
brother
came
sliding
through
the
trees,
moving
almost
as
quiet
as
another
brother
he
remembered
dimly
from
long
ago,
the
white
one
with
the
eyes
of
blood.
This
brotherвЂ™s
eyes
were
pools
of
shadow,
but
the
fur
on
the
back
of
his
neck
was
bristling.
He
had
heard
the
sounds
as
well,
and
known
they
meant
danger.

This
time
the
clink
and
scrape
were
followed
by
a
slithering
and
the
soft
swift
patter
of
skinfeet
on
stone.
The
wind
brought
the
faintest
whiff
of
a
man-smell
he
did
not
know.
Stranger.
Danger.
Death.

He
ran
toward
the
sound,
his
brother
racing
beside
him.
The
stone
dens
rose
before
them,
walls
slick
and
wet.
He
bared
his
teeth,
but
the
man-rock
took
no
notice.
A
gate
loomed
up,
a
black
iron
snake
coiled
tight
about
bar
and
post.
When
he
crashed
against
it,
the
gate
shuddered
and
the
snake
clanked
and
slithered
and
held.
Through
the
bars
he
could
look
down
the
long
stone
burrow
that
ran
between
the
walls
to
the
stony
field
beyond,
but
there
was
no
way
through.
He
could
force
his
muzzle
between
the
bars,
but
no
more.
Many
a
time
his
brother
had
tried
to
crack
the
black
bones
of
the
gate
between
his
teeth,
but
they
would
not
break.
They
had
tried
to
dig
under,
but
there
were
great
flat
stones
beneath,
half-covered
by
earth
and
blown
leaves.

Snarling,
he
paced
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
gate,
then
threw
himself
at
it
once
more.
It
moved
a
little
and
slammed
him
back.
Locked,
something
whispered.
Chained.
The
voice
he
did
not
hear,
the
scent
without
a
smell.
The
other
ways
were
closed
as
well.
Where
doors
opened
in
the
walls
of
man-rock,
the
wood
was
thick
and
strong.
There
was
no
way
out.

There
is,
the
whisper
came,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
see
the
shadow
of
a
great
tree
covered
in
needles,
slanting
up
out
of
the
black
earth
to
ten
times
the
height
of
a
man.
Yet
when
he
looked
about,
it
was
not
there.
The
other
side
of
the
godswood,
the
sentinel,
hurry,
hurryвЂ¦

Through
the
gloom
of
night
came
a
muffled
shout,
cut
short.

Swiftly,
swiftly,
he
whirled
and
bounded
back
into
the
trees,
wet
leaves
rustling
beneath
his
paws,
branches
whipping
at
him
as
he
rushed
past.
He
could
hear
his
brother
following
close.
They
plunged
under
the
heart
tree
and
around
the
cold
pool,
through
the
blackberry
bushes,
under
a
tangle
of
oaks
and
ash
and
hawthorn
scrub,
to
the
far
side
of
the
woodвЂ¦
and
there
it
was,
the
shadow
heвЂ™d
glimpsed
without
seeing,
the
slanting
tree
pointing
at
the
rooftops.
Sentinel,
came
the
thought.

He
remembered
how
it
was
to
climb
it
then.
The
needles
everywhere,
scratching
at
his
bare
face
and
falling
down
the
back
of
his
neck,
the
sticky
sap
on
his
hands,
the
sharp
piney
smell
of
it.
It
was
an
easy
tree
for
a
boy
to
climb,
leaning
as
it
did,
crooked,
the
branches
so
close
together
they
almost
made
a
ladder,
slanting
right
up
to
the
roof.

Growling,
he
sniffed
around
the
base
of
the
tree,
lifted
a
leg
and
marked
it
with
a
stream
of
urine.
A
low
branch
brushed
his
face,
and
he
snapped
at
it,
twisting
and
pulling
until
the
wood
cracked
and
tore.
His
mouth
was
full
of
needles
and
the
bitter
taste
of
the
sap.
He
shook
his
head
and
snarled.

His
brother
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
lifted
his
voice
in
a
ululating
howl,
his
song
black
with
mourning.
The
way
was
no
way.
They
were
not
squirrels,
nor
the
cubs
of
men,
they
could
not
wriggle
up
the
trunks
of
trees,
clinging
with
soft
pink
paws
and
clumsy
feet.
They
were
runners,
hunters,
prowlers.

Off
across
the
night,
beyond
the
stone
that
hemmed
them
close,
the
dogs
woke
and
began
to
bark.
One
and
then
another
and
then
all
of
them,
a
great
clamor.
They
smelled
it
too;
the
scent
of
foes
and
fear.

A
desperate
fury
filled
him,
hot
as
hunger.
He
sprang
away
from
the
wall
loped
off
beneath
the
trees,
the
shadows
of
branch
and
leaf
dappling
his
grey
furвЂ¦
and
then
he
turned
and
raced
back
in
a
rush.
His
feet
flew
kicking
up
wet
leaves
and
pine
needles,
and
for
a
little
time
he
was
a
hunter
and
an
antlered
stag
was
fleeing
before
him
and
he
could
see
it,
smell
it,
and
he
ran
full
out
in
pursuit.
The
smell
of
fear
made
his
heart
thunder
and
slaver
ran
from
his
jaws,
and
he
reached
the
falling
tree
in
stride
and
threw
himself
up
the
trunk,
claws
scrabbling
at
the
bark
for
purchase.
Upward
he
bounded,
up,
two
bounds,
three,
hardly
slowing,
until
he
was
among
the
lower
limbs.
Branches
tangled
his
feet
and
whipped
at
his
eyes,
grey-green
needles
scattered
as
he
shouldered
through
them,
snapping.
He
had
to
slow.
Something
snagged
at
his
foot
and
he
wrenched
it
free,
snarling.
The
trunk
narrowed
under
him,
the
slope
steeper,
almost
straight
up,
and
wet.
The
bark
tore
like
skin
when
he
tried
to
claw
at
it.
He
was
a
third
of
the
way
up,
halfway,
more,
the
roof
was
almost
within
reachвЂ¦
and
then
he
put
down
a
foot
and
felt
it
slip
off
the
curve
of
wet
wood,
and
suddenly
he
was
sliding,
stumbling.
He
yowled
in
fear
and
fury,
falling,
falling,
and
twisted
around
while
the
ground
rushed
up
to
break
himвЂ¦

And
then
Bran
was
back
abed
in
his
lonely
tower
room,
tangled
in
his
blankets,
his
breath
coming
hard.
вЂњSummer,вЂќ
he
cried
aloud.
вЂњSummer.вЂќ
His
shoulder
seemed
to
ache,
as
if
he
had
fallen
on
it,
but
he
knew
it
was
only
the
ghost
of
what
the
wolf
was
feeling.
Jojen
told
it
true.
I
am
a
beastling.
Outside
he
could
hear
the
faint
barking
of
dogs.
The
sea
has
come.
ItвЂ™s
flowing
over
the
walls,
just
as
Jojen
saw.
Bran
grabbed
the
bar
overhead
and
pulled
himself
up,
shouting
for
help.
No
one
came,
and
after
a
moment
he
remembered
that
no
one
would.
They
had
taken
the
guard
off
his
door.
Ser
Rodrik
had
needed
every
man
of
fighting
age
he
could
lay
his
hands
on,
so
Winterfell
had
been
left
with
only
a
token
garrison.

The
rest
had
left
eight
days
past,
six
hundred
men
from
Winterfell
and
the
nearest
holdfasts.
Cley
Cerwyn
was
bringing
three
hundred
more
to
join
them
on
the
march,
and
Maester
Luwin
had
sent
ravens
before
them,
summoning
levies
from
White
Harbor
and
the
barrowlands
and
even
the
deep
places
inside
the
wolfswood.
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
was
under
attack
by
some
monstrous
war
chief
named
Dagmer
Cleftjaw.
Old
Nan
said
he
couldnвЂ™t
be
killed,
that
once
a
foe
had
cut
his
head
in
two
with
an
axe,
but
Dagmer
was
so
fierce
heвЂ™d
just
pushed
the
two
halves
back
together
and
held
them
until
they
healed
up.
Could
Dagmer
have
won?
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
was
many
days
from
Winterfell,
yet
stillвЂ¦

Bran
pulled
himself
from
the
bed,
moving
bar
to
bar
until
he
reached
the
windows.
His
fingers
fumbled
a
little
as
he
swung
back
the
shutters.
The
yard
was
empty,
and
all
the
windows
he
could
see
were
black.
Winterfell
slept.
вЂњHodor!вЂќ
he
shouted
down,
as
loud
as
he
could.
Hodor
would
be
asleep
above
the
stables,
but
maybe
if
he
yelled
loud
enough
heвЂ™d
hear,
or
somebody
would.
вЂњHodor,
come
fast!
Osha!
Meera,
Jojen,
anyone!вЂќ
Bran
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth.
вЂњHOOOOODOOOOOR!вЂќ

But
when
the
door
crashed
open
behind
him,
the
man
who
stepped
through
was
no
one
Bran
knew.
He
wore
a
leather
jerkin
sewn
with
overlapping
iron
disks,
and
carried
a
dirk
in
one
hand
and
an
axe
strapped
to
his
back.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want?вЂќ
Bran
demanded,
afraid.
вЂњThis
is
my
room.
You
get
out
of
here.вЂќ

Theon
Greyjoy
followed
him
into
the
bedchamber.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
not
here
to
harm
you,
Bran.вЂќ

вЂњTheon?вЂќ
Bran
felt
dizzy
with
relief.
вЂњDid
Robb
send
you?
Is
he
here
too?вЂќ

вЂњRobbвЂ™s
far
away.
He
canвЂ™t
help
you
now.вЂќ

вЂњHelp
me?вЂќ
He
was
confused.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
scare
me,
Theon.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
Prince
Theon
now.
WeвЂ™re
both
princes,
Bran.
Who
would
have
dreamed
it?
But
IвЂ™ve
taken
your
castle,
my
prince.вЂќ

вЂњWinterfell?вЂќ
Bran
shook
his
head.
вЂњNo,
you
couldnвЂ™t.вЂќ

вЂњLeave
us,
Werlag.вЂќ
The
man
with
the
dirk
withdrew.
Theon
seated
himself
on
the
bed.
вЂњI
sent
four
men
over
the
walls
with
grappling
claws
and
ropes,
and
they
opened
a
postern
gate
for
the
rest
of
us.
My
men
are
dealing
with
yours
even
now.
I
promise
you,
Winterfell
is
mine.вЂќ

Bran
did
not
understand.
вЂњBut
youвЂ™re
FatherвЂ™s
ward.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
now
you
and
your
brother
are
my
wards.
As
soon
as
the
fightingвЂ™s
done,
my
men
will
be
bringing
the
rest
of
your
people
together
in
the
Great
Hall.
You
and
I
are
going
to
speak
to
them.
YouвЂ™ll
tell
them
how
youвЂ™ve
yielded
Winterfell
to
me,
and
command
them
to
serve
and
obey
their
new
lord
as
they
did
the
old.вЂќ

вЂњI
wonвЂ™t,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
fight
you
and
throw
you
out.
I
never
yielded,
you
canвЂ™t
make
me
say
I
did.вЂќ

вЂњThis
is
no
game,
Bran,
so
donвЂ™t
play
the
boy
with
me,
I
wonвЂ™t
stand
for
it.
The
castle
is
mine,
but
these
people
are
still
yours.
If
the
prince
would
keep
them
safe,
heвЂ™d
best
do
as
heвЂ™s
told.вЂќ
He
rose
and
went
to
the
door.
вЂњSomeone
will
come
dress
you
and
carry
you
to
the
Great
Hall.
Think
carefully
on
what
you
want
to
say.вЂќ

The
waiting
made
Bran
feel
even
more
helpless
than
before.
He
sat
in
the
window
seat,
staring
out
at
dark
towers
and
walls
black
as
shadow.
Once
he
thought
he
heard
shouting
beyond
the
Guards
Hall,
and
something
that
might
have
been
the
clash
of
swords,
but
he
did
not
have
SummerвЂ™s
ears
to
hear,
nor
his
nose
to
smell.
Awake,
I
am
still
broken,
but
when
I
sleep,
when
IвЂ™m
Summer,
I
can
run
and
fight
and
hear
and
smell.

He
had
expected
that
Hodor
would
come
for
him,
or
maybe
one
of
the
serving
girls,
but
when
the
door
next
opened
it
was
Maester
Luwin,
carrying
a
candle.
вЂњBran,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњyouвЂ¦
know
what
has
happened?
You
have
been
told?вЂќ
The
skin
was
broken
above
his
left
eye,
and
blood
ran
down
that
side
of
his
face.

вЂњTheon
came.
He
said
Winterfell
was
his
now.вЂќ

The
maester
set
down
the
candle
and
wiped
the
blood
off
his
cheek.
вЂњThey
swam
the
moat.
Climbed
the
walls
with
hook
and
rope.
Came
over
wet
and
dripping,
steel
in
hand.вЂќ
He
sat
on
the
chair
by
the
door,
as
fresh
blood
flowed.
вЂњAlebelly
was
on
the
gate,
they
surprised
him
in
the
turret
and
killed
him.
HayheadвЂ™s
wounded
as
well.
I
had
time
to
send
off
two
ravens
before
they
burst
in.
The
bird
to
White
Harbor
got
away,
but
they
brought
down
the
other
with
an
arrow.вЂќ
The
maester
stared
at
the
rushes.
вЂњSer
Rodrik
took
too
many
of
our
men,
but
I
am
to
blame
as
much
as
he
is.
I
never
saw
this
danger,
I
neverвЂ¦вЂќ

Jojen
saw
it,
Bran
thought.
вЂњYou
better
help
me
dress.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
thatвЂ™s
so.вЂќ
In
the
heavy
ironbound
chest
at
the
foot
of
BranвЂ™s
bed
the
maester
found
smallclothes,
breeches,
and
tunic.
вЂњYou
are
the
Stark
in
Winterfell,
and
RobbвЂ™s
heir.
You
must
look
princely.вЂќ
Together
they
garbed
him
as
befit
a
lord.

вЂњTheon
wants
me
to
yield
the
castle,вЂќ
Bran
said
as
the
maester
was
fastening
the
cloak
with
his
favorite
wolfвЂ™s-head
clasp
of
silver
and
jet.

вЂњThere
is
no
shame
in
that.
A
lord
must
protect
his
smallfolk.
Cruel
places
breed
cruel
peoples,
Bran,
remember
that
as
you
deal
with
these
ironmen.
Your
lord
father
did
what
he
could
to
gentle
Theon,
but
I
fear
it
was
too
little
and
too
late.вЂќ

The
ironman
who
came
for
them
was
a
squat
thick-bodied
man
with
a
coal-black
beard
that
covered
half
his
chest.
He
bore
the
boy
easily
enough,
though
he
looked
none
too
happy
with
the
task.
RickonвЂ™s
bedchamber
was
a
half
turn
down
the
steps.
The
four-year-old
was
cranky
at
being
woken.
вЂњI
want
Mother,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
want
her.
And
Shaggydog
too.вЂќ

вЂњYour
mother
is
far
away,
my
prince.вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
pulled
a
bedrobe
over
the
childвЂ™s
head.
вЂњBut
IвЂ™m
here,
and
Bran.вЂќ
He
took
Rickon
by
the
hand
and
led
him
out.

Below,
they
came
on
Meera
and
Jojen
being
herded
from
their
room
by
a
bald
man
whose
spear
was
three
feet
taller
than
he
was.
When
Jojen
looked
at
Bran,
his
eyes
were
green
pools
full
of
sorrow.
Other
ironmen
had
rousted
the
Freys.
вЂњYour
brotherвЂ™s
lost
his
kingdom,вЂќ
Little
Walder
told
Bran.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
no
prince
now,
just
a
hostage.вЂќ

вЂњSo
are
you,вЂќ
Jojen
said,
вЂњand
me,
and
all
of
us.вЂќ

вЂњNo
one
was
talking
to
you,
frogeater.вЂќ

One
of
the
ironmen
went
before
them
carrying
a
torch,
but
the
rain
had
started
again
and
soon
drowned
it
out.
As
they
hurried
across
the
yard
they
could
hear
the
direwolves
howling
in
the
godswood.
I
hope
Summer
wasnвЂ™t
hurt
falling
from
the
tree.

Theon
Greyjoy
was
seated
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks.
He
had
taken
off
his
cloak.
Over
a
shirt
of
fine
mail
he
wore
a
black
surcoat
emblazoned
with
the
golden
kraken
of
his
House.
His
hands
rested
on
the
wolvesвЂ™
heads
carved
at
the
ends
of
the
wide
stone
arms.
вЂњTheonвЂ™s
sitting
in
RobbвЂ™s
chair,вЂќ
Rickon
said.

вЂњHush,
Rickon.вЂќ
Bran
could
feel
the
menace
around
them,
but
his
brother
was
too
young.
A
few
torches
had
been
lit,
and
a
fire
kindled
in
the
great
hearth,
but
most
of
the
hall
remained
in
darkness.
There
was
no
place
to
sit
with
the
benches
stacked
against
the
walls,
so
the
castle
folk
stood
in
small
groups,
not
daring
to
speak.
He
saw
Old
Nan,
her
toothless
mouth
opening
and
closing.
Hayhead
was
carried
in
between
two
of
the
other
guards,
a
bloodstained
bandage
wrapped
about
his
bare
chest.
Poxy
Tym
wept
inconsolably,
and
Beth
Cassel
cried
with
fear.

вЂњWhat
have
we
here?вЂќ
Theon
asked
of
the
Reeds
and
Freys.

вЂњThese
are
Lady
CatelynвЂ™s
wards,
both
named
Walder
Frey,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
explained.
вЂњAnd
this
is
Jojen
Reed
and
his
sister
Meera,
son
and
daughter
to
Howland
Reed
of
Greywater
Watch,
who
came
to
renew
their
oaths
of
fealty
to
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњSome
might
call
that
ill-timed,вЂќ
said
Theon,
вЂњthough
not
for
me.
Here
you
are
and
here
youвЂ™ll
stay.вЂќ
He
vacated
the
high
seat.
вЂњBring
the
prince
here,
Lorren.вЂќ
The
black-bearded
man
dumped
Bran
onto
the
stone
as
if
he
were
a
sack
of
oats.

People
were
still
being
driven
into
the
Great
Hall,
prodded
along
with
shouts
and
the
butts
of
the
spears.
Gage
and
Osha
arrived
from
the
kitchens,
spotted
with
flour
from
making
the
morning
bread.
Mikken
they
dragged
in
cursing.
Farlen
entered
limping,
struggling
to
support
Palla.
Her
dress
had
been
ripped
in
two;
she
held
it
up
with
a
clenched
fist
and
walked
as
if
every
step
were
agony.
Septon
Chayle
rushed
to
lend
a
hand,
but
one
of
the
ironmen
knocked
him
to
the
floor.

The
last
man
marched
through
the
doors
was
the
prisoner
Reek,
whose
stench
preceded
him,
ripe
and
pungent.
Bran
felt
his
stomach
twist
at
the
smell
of
him.
вЂњWe
found
this
one
locked
in
a
tower
cell,вЂќ
announced
his
escort,
a
beardless
youth
with
ginger-colored
hair
and
sodden
clothing,
doubtless
one
of
those
whoвЂ™d
swum
the
moat.
вЂњHe
says
they
call
him
Reek.вЂќ

вЂњCanвЂ™t
think
why,вЂќ
Theon
said,
smiling.
вЂњDo
you
always
smell
so
bad,
or
did
you
just
finish
fucking
a
pig?вЂќ

вЂњHavenвЂ™t
fucked
no
one
since
they
took
me,
mвЂ™lord.
HekeвЂ™s
me
true
name.
I
was
in
service
to
the
Bastard
oвЂ™
the
Dreadfort
till
the
Starks
give
him
an
arrow
in
the
back
for
a
wedding
gift.вЂќ

Theon
found
that
amusing.
вЂњWho
did
he
marry?вЂќ

вЂњThe
widow
oвЂ™
Hornwood,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

вЂњThat
crone?
Was
he
blind?
She
has
teats
like
empty
wineskins,
dry
and
withered.вЂќ

вЂњIt
wasnвЂ™t
her
teats
he
wed
her
for,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

The
ironmen
slammed
shut
the
tall
doors
at
the
foot
of
the
hall.
From
the
high
seat,
Bran
could
see
about
twenty
of
them.
He
probably
left
some
guards
on
the
gates
and
the
armory.
Even
so,
there
couldnвЂ™t
be
more
than
thirty.

Theon
raised
his
hands
for
quiet.
вЂњYou
all
know
meвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњAye,
we
know
you
for
a
sack
of
steaming
dung!вЂќ
shouted
Mikken,
before
the
bald
man
drove
the
butt
of
his
spear
into
his
gut,
then
smashed
him
across
the
face
with
the
shaft.
The
smith
stumbled
to
his
knees
and
spat
out
a
tooth.

вЂњMikken,
you
be
silent.вЂќ
Bran
tried
to
sound
stern
and
lordly,
the
way
Robb
did
when
he
made
a
command,
but
his
voice
betrayed
him
and
the
words
came
out
in
a
shrill
squeak.

вЂњListen
to
your
little
lordling,
Mikken,вЂќ
said
Theon.
вЂњHe
has
more
sense
than
you
do.вЂќ

A
good
lord
protects
his
people,
he
reminded
himself.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
yielded
Winterfell
to
Theon.вЂќ

вЂњLouder,
Bran.
And
call
me
prince.вЂќ

He
raised
his
voice.
вЂњI
have
yielded
Winterfell
to
Prince
Theon.
All
of
you
should
do
as
he
commands
you.вЂќ

вЂњDamned
if
I
will!вЂќ
bellowed
Mikken.

Theon
ignored
the
outburst.
вЂњMy
father
has
donned
the
ancient
crown
of
salt
and
rock,
and
declared
himself
King
of
the
Iron
Islands.
He
claims
the
north
as
well,
by
right
of
conquest.
You
are
all
his
subjects.вЂќ

вЂњBugger
that.вЂќ
Mikken
wiped
the
blood
from
his
mouth.
вЂњI
serve
the
Starks,
not
some
treasonous
squid
ofвЂ”aah.вЂќ
The
butt
of
the
spear
smashed
him
face
first
into
the
stone
floor.

вЂњSmiths
have
strong
arms
and
weak
heads,вЂќ
observed
Theon.
вЂњBut
if
the
rest
of
you
serve
me
as
loyally
as
you
served
Ned
Stark,
youвЂ™ll
find
me
as
generous
a
lord
as
you
could
want.вЂќ
on
his
hands
and
knees,
Mikken
spat
blood.
Please
donвЂ™t,
Bran
wished
at
him,
but
the
blacksmith
shouted,
вЂњIf
you
think
you
can
hold
the
north
with
this
sorry
lot
oвЂ™вЂ”вЂќ

The
bald
man
drove
the
point
of
his
spear
into
the
back
of
MikkenвЂ™s
neck.
Steel
slid
through
flesh
and
came
out
his
throat
in
a
welter
of
blood.
A
woman
screamed,
and
Meera
wrapped
her
arms
around
Rickon.
ItвЂ™s
blood
he
drowned
on,
Bran
thought
numbly.
His
own
blood.

вЂњWho
else
has
something
to
say?вЂќ
asked
Theon
Greyjoy.

вЂњHodor
hodor
hodor
hodor,вЂќ
shouted
Hodor,
eyes
wide.

вЂњSomeone
kindly
shut
that
halfwit
up.вЂќ

Two
ironmen
began
to
beat
Hodor
with
the
butts
of
their
spears.
The
stableboy
dropped
to
the
floor,
trying
to
shield
himself
with
his
hands.

вЂњI
will
be
as
good
a
lord
to
you
as
Eddard
Stark
ever
was.вЂќ
Theon
raised
his
voice
to
be
heard
above
the
smack
of
wood
on
flesh.
вЂњBetray
me,
though,
and
youвЂ™ll
wish
you
hadnвЂ™t.
And
donвЂ™t
think
the
men
you
see
here
are
the
whole
of
my
power.
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square
and
Deepwood
Motte
will
soon
be
ours
as
well,
and
my
uncle
is
sailing
up
the
Saltspear
to
seize
Moat
Cailin.
If
Robb
Stark
can
stave
off
the
Lannisters,
he
may
reign
as
King
of
the
Trident
hereafter,
but
House
Greyjoy
holds
the
north
now.вЂќ

вЂњStarkвЂ™s
lords
will
fight
you,вЂќ
the
man
Reek
called
out.
вЂњThat
bloated
pig
at
White
Harbor
for
one,
and
them
Umbers
and
Karstarks
too.
YouвЂ™ll
need
men.
Free
me
and
IвЂ™m
yours.вЂќ

Theon
weighed
him
a
moment.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
cleverer
than
you
smell,
but
I
could
not
suffer
that
stench.вЂќ

вЂњWell,вЂќ
said
Reek,
вЂњI
could
wash
some.
If
I
was
free.вЂќ

вЂњA
man
of
rare
good
sense.вЂќ
Theon
smiled.
вЂњBend
the
knee.вЂќ
one
of
the
ironmen
handed
Reek
a
sword,
and
he
laid
it
at
TheonвЂ™s
feet
and
swore
obedience
to
House
Greyjoy
and
King
Balon.
Bran
could
not
look.
The
green
dream
was
coming
true.

вЂњMвЂ™lord
Greyjoy!вЂќ
Osha
stepped
past
MikkenвЂ™s
body.
вЂњI
was
brought
here
captive
too.
You
were
there
the
day
I
was
taken.вЂќ

I
thought
you
were
a
friend,
Bran
thought,
hurt.

вЂњI
need
fighters,вЂќ
Theon
declared,
вЂњnot
kitchen
sluts.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
Robb
Stark
put
me
in
the
kitchens.
For
the
best
part
of
a
year,
IвЂ™ve
been
left
to
scour
kettles,
scrape
grease,
and
warm
the
straw
for
this
one.вЂќ
She
threw
a
look
at
Gage.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
had
a
bellyful
of
it.
Put
a
spear
in
my
hand
again.вЂќ

вЂњI
got
a
spear
for
you
right
here,вЂќ
said
the
bald
man
whoвЂ™d
killed
Mikken.
He
grabbed
his
crotch,
grinning.

Osha
drove
her
bony
knee
up
between
his
legs.
вЂњYou
keep
that
soft
pink
thing.вЂќ
She
wrested
the
spear
from
him
and
used
the
butt
to
knock
him
off
his
feet.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
me
the
wood
and
iron.вЂќ
The
bald
man
writhed
on
the
floor
while
the
other
reavers
sent
up
gales
of
laughter.

Theon
laughed
with
the
rest.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
do,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњKeep
the
spear;
Stygg
can
find
another.
Now
bend
the
knee
and
swear.вЂќ

When
no
one
else
rushed
forward
to
pledge
service,
they
were
dismissed
with
a
warning
to
do
their
work
and
make
no
trouble.
Hodor
was
given
the
task
of
bearing
Bran
back
to
his
bed.
His
face
was
all
ugly
from
the
beating,
his
nose
swollen
and
one
eye
closed.
вЂњHodor,вЂќ
he
sobbed
between
cracked
lips
as
he
lifted
Bran
in
huge
strong
arms
and
bloody
hands
and
carried
him
back
out
into
the
rain.





ARYA

вЂњThereвЂ™s
ghosts,
I
know
there
is.вЂќ
Hot
Pie
was
kneading
bread,
his
arms
floured
up
to
his
elbows.
вЂњPia
saw
something
in
the
buttery
last
night.вЂќ

Arya
made
a
rude
noise.
Pia
was
always
seeing
things
in
the
buttery.
Usually
they
were
men.
вЂњCan
I
have
a
tart?вЂќ
she
asked.
вЂњYou
baked
a
whole
tray.вЂќ

вЂњI
need
a
whole
tray.
Ser
Amory
is
partial
to
them.вЂќ

She
hated
Ser
Amory.
вЂњLetвЂ™s
spit
on
them.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
looked
around
nervously.
The
kitchens
were
full
of
shadows
and
echoes,
but
the
other
cooks
and
scullions
were
all
asleep
in
the
cavernous
lofts
above
the
ovens.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
know.вЂќ

вЂњHe
will
not,вЂќ
Arya
said.
вЂњYou
canвЂ™t
taste
spit.вЂќ

вЂњIf
he
does,
itвЂ™s
me
theyвЂ™ll
whip.вЂќ
Hot
Pie
stopped
his
kneading.
вЂњYou
shouldnвЂ™t
even
be
here.
ItвЂ™s
the
black
of
night.вЂќ

It
was,
but
Arya
never
minded.
Even
in
the
black
of
night,
the
kitchens
were
never
still;
there
was
always
someone
rolling
dough
for
the
morning
bread,
stirring
a
kettle
with
a
long
wooden
spoon,
or
butchering
a
hog
for
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
breakfast
bacon.
Tonight
it
was
Hot
Pie.

вЂњIf
Pinkeye
wakes
and
finds
you
goneвЂ”вЂќ
Hot
Pie
said.

вЂњPinkeye
never
wakes.вЂќ
His
true
name
was
Mebble,
but
everyone
called
him
Pinkeye
for
his
runny
eyes.
вЂњNot
once
heвЂ™s
passed
out.вЂќ
Each
morning
he
broke
his
fast
with
ale.
Each
evening
he
fell
into
a
drunken
sleep
after
supper,
wine-colored
spit
running
down
his
chin.
Arya
would
wait
until
she
heard
him
snoring,
then
creep
barefoot
up
the
servantвЂ™s
stair,
making
no
more
noise
than
the
mouse
sheвЂ™d
been.
She
carried
neither
candle
nor
taper.
Syrio
had
told
her
once
that
darkness
could
be
her
friend,
and
he
was
right.
If
she
had
the
moon
and
the
stars
to
see
by,
that
was
enough.
вЂњI
bet
we
could
escape,
and
Pinkeye
wouldnвЂ™t
even
notice
I
was
gone,вЂќ
she
told
Hot
Pie.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to
escape.
ItвЂ™s
better
here
than
it
was
in
them
woods.
I
donвЂ™t
want
to
eat
no
worms.
Here,
sprinkle
some
flour
on
the
board.вЂќ

Arya
cocked
her
head.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
that?вЂќ

вЂњWhat?
I
donвЂ™tвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњListen
with
your
ears,
not
your
mouth.
That
was
a
warhorn.
Two
blasts,
didnвЂ™t
you
hear?
And
there,
thatвЂ™s
the
portcullis
chains,
someoneвЂ™s
going
out
or
coming
in.
Want
to
go
see?вЂќ
The
gates
of
Harrenhal
had
not
been
opened
since
the
morning
Lord
Tywin
had
marched
with
his
host.

вЂњIвЂ™m
making
the
morning
bread,вЂќ
Hot
Pie
complained.
вЂњAnyhow
I
donвЂ™t
like
it
when
itвЂ™s
dark,
I
told
you.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
going.
IвЂ™ll
tell
you
after.
Can
I
have
a
tart?вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ

She
filched
one
anyway,
and
ate
it
on
her
way
out.
It
was
stuffed
with
chopped
nuts
and
fruit
and
cheese,
the
crust
flaky
and
still
warm
from
the
oven.
Eating
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
tart
made
Arya
feel
daring.
Barefoot
surefoot
lightfoot,
she
sang
under
her
breath.
I
am
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal.

The
horn
had
stirred
the
castle
from
sleep;
men
were
coming
out
into
the
ward
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
about.
Arya
fell
in
with
the
others.
A
line
of
ox
carts
were
rumbling
under
the
portcullis.
Plunder,
she
knew
at
once.
The
riders
escorting
the
carts
spoke
in
a
babble
of
queer
tongues.
Their
armor
glinted
pale
in
the
moonlight,
and
she
saw
a
pair
of
striped
black-and-white
zorses.
The
Bloody
Mummers.
Arya
withdrew
a
little
deeper
into
the
shadows,
and
watched
as
a
huge
black
bear
rolled
by,
caged
in
the
back
of
a
wagon.
Other
carts
were
loaded
down
with
silver
plate,
weapons
and
shields,
bags
of
flour,
pens
of
squealing
hogs
and
scrawny
dogs
and
chickens.
Arya
was
thinking
how
long
it
had
been
since
sheвЂ™d
had
a
slice
off
a
pork
roast
when
she
saw
the
first
of
the
prisoners.

By
his
bearing
and
the
proud
way
he
held
his
head,
he
must
have
been
a
lord.
She
could
see
mail
glinting
beneath
his
torn
red
surcoat.
At
first
Arya
took
him
for
a
Lannister,
but
when
he
passed
near
a
torch
she
saw
his
device
was
a
silver
fist,
not
a
lion.
His
wrists
were
bound
tightly,
and
a
rope
around
one
ankle
tied
him
to
the
man
behind
him,
and
him
to
the
man
behind
him,
so
the
whole
column
had
to
shuffle
along
in
a
lurching
lockstep.
Many
of
the
captives
were
wounded.
If
any
halted,
one
of
the
riders
would
trot
up
and
give
him
a
lick
of
the
whip
to
get
him
moving
again.
She
tried
to
judge
how
many
prisoners
there
were,
but
lost
count
before
she
got
to
fifty.
There
were
twice
that
many
at
least.
Their
clothing
was
stained
with
mud
and
blood,
and
in
the
torchlight
it
was
hard
to
make
out
all
their
badges
and
sigils,
but
some
of
those
Arya
glimpsed
she
recognized.
Twin
towers.
Sunburst.
Bloody
man.
Battle-axe.
The
battle-axe
is
for
Cerwyn,
and
the
white
sun
on
black
is
Karstark.
TheyвЂ™re
northmen.
My
fatherвЂ™s
men,
and
RobbвЂ™s.
She
didnвЂ™t
like
to
think
what
that
might
mean.

The
Bloody
Mummers
began
to
dismount.
Stableboys
emerged
sleepy
from
their
straw
to
tend
their
lathered
horses.
One
of
the
riders
was
shouting
for
ale.
The
noise
brought
Ser
Amory
Lorch
out
onto
the
covered
gallery
above
the
ward,
flanked
by
two
torchbearers.
Goat-helmed
Vargo
Hoat
reined
up
below
him.
вЂњMy
lord
cathellan,вЂќ
the
sellsword
said.
He
had
a
thick,
slobbery
voice,
as
if
his
tongue
was
too
big
for
his
mouth.

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
all
this,
Hoat?вЂќ
Ser
Amory
demanded,
frowning.

вЂњCaptiths.
Rooth
Bolton
thought
to
croth
the
river,
but
my
Brafe
Companions
cut
his
van
to
pieceth.
Killed
many,
and
thent
Bolton
running.
Thith
ith
their
lord
commander,
Glover,
and
the
one
behind
ith
Ther
Aenyth
Frey.вЂќ

Ser
Amory
Lorch
stared
down
at
the
roped
captives
with
his
little
pig
eyes.
Arya
did
not
think
he
was
pleased.
Everyone
in
the
castle
knew
that
he
and
Vargo
Hoat
hated
each
other.
вЂњVery
well,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњSer
Cadwyn,
take
these
men
to
the
dungeons.вЂќ

The
lord
with
the
mailed
fist
on
his
surcoat
raised
his
eyes.
вЂњWe
were
promised
honorable
treatmentвЂ”вЂќ
he
began.

вЂњSilenth!вЂќ
Vargo
Hoat
screamed
at
him,
spraying
spittle.

Ser
Amory
addressed
the
captives.
вЂњWhat
Hoat
promised
you
is
nothing
to
me.
Lord
Tywin
made
me
the
castellan
of
Harrenhal,
and
I
shall
do
with
you
as
I
please.вЂќ
He
gestured
to
his
guards.
вЂњThe
great
cell
under
the
WidowвЂ™s
Tower
ought
to
hold
them
all.
Any
who
do
not
care
to
go
are
free
to
die
here.вЂќ

As
his
men
herded
off
the
captives
at
spearpoint,
Arya
saw
Pinkeye
emerge
from
the
stairwell,
blinking
at
the
torchlight.
If
he
found
her
missing,
he
would
shout
and
threaten
to
whip
the
bloody
hide
off
her,
but
she
was
not
afraid.
He
was
no
Weese.
He
was
forever
threatening
to
whip
the
bloody
hide
off
this
one
or
that
one,
but
Arya
never
actually
knew
him
to
hit.
Still,
it
would
be
better
if
he
never
saw
her.
She
glanced
around.
The
oxen
were
being
unharnessed,
the
carts
unloaded,
while
the
Brave
Companions
clamored
for
drink
and
the
curious
gathered
around
the
caged
bear.
In
the
commotion,
it
was
not
hard
to
slip
off
unseen.
She
went
back
the
way
she
had
come,
wanting
to
be
out
of
sight
before
someone
noticed
her
and
thought
to
put
her
to
work.

Away
from
the
gates
and
the
stables,
the
great
castle
was
largely
deserted.
The
noise
dwindled
behind
her.
A
swirling
wind
gusted,
drawing
a
high
shivery
scream
from
the
cracks
in
the
Wailing
Tower.
Leaves
had
begun
to
fall
from
the
trees
in
the
godswood,
and
she
could
hear
them
moving
through
the
deserted
courtyards
and
between
the
empty
buildings,
making
a
faint
skittery
sound
as
the
wind
drove
them
across
the
stones.
Now
that
Harrenhal
was
near
empty
once
again,
sound
did
queer
things
here.
Sometimes
the
stones
seemed
to
drink
up
noise,
shrouding
the
yards
in
a
blanket
of
silence.
Other
times,
the
echoes
had
a
life
of
their
own,
so
every
footfall
became
the
tread
of
a
ghostly
army,
and
every
distant
voice
a
ghostly
feast.
The
funny
sounds
were
one
of
the
things
that
bothered
Hot
Pie,
but
not
Arya.

Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
flitted
across
the
middle
bailey,
around
the
Tower
of
Dread,
and
through
the
empty
mews,
where
people
said
the
spirits
of
dead
falcons
stirred
the
air
with
ghostly
wings.
She
could
go
where
she
would.
The
garrison
numbered
no
more
than
a
hundred
men,
so
small
a
troop
that
they
were
lost
in
Harrenhal.
The
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths
was
closed
off,
along
with
many
of
the
lesser
buildings,
even
the
Wailing
Tower.
Ser
Amory
Lorch
resided
in
the
castellanвЂ™s
chambers
in
Kingspyre,
themselves
as
spacious
as
a
lordвЂ™s,
and
Arya
and
the
other
servants
had
moved
to
the
cellars
beneath
him
so
they
would
be
close
at
hand.
While
Lord
Tywin
had
been
in
residence,
there
was
always
a
man-at-arms
wanting
to
know
your
business.
But
now
there
were
only
a
hundred
men
left
to
guard
a
thousand
doors,
and
no
one
seemed
to
know
who
should
be
where,
or
care
much.

As
she
passed
the
armory,
Arya
heard
the
ring
of
a
hammer.
A
deep
orange
glow
shone
through
the
high
windows.
She
climbed
to
the
roof
and
peeked
down.
Gendry
was
beating
out
a
breastplate.
When
he
worked,
nothing
existed
for
him
but
metal,
bellows,
fire.
The
hammer
was
like
part
of
his
arm.
She
watched
the
play
of
muscles
in
his
chest
and
listened
to
the
steel
music
he
made.
HeвЂ™s
strong,
she
thought.
As
he
took
up
the
long-handled
tongs
to
dip
the
breastplate
into
the
quenching
trough,
Arya
slithered
through
the
window
and
leapt
down
to
the
floor
beside
him.

He
did
not
seem
surprised
to
see
her.
вЂњYou
should
be
abed,
girl.вЂќ
The
breastplate
hissed
like
a
cat
as
he
dipped
it
in
the
cold
water.
вЂњWhat
was
all
that
noise?вЂќ

вЂњVargo
HoatвЂ™s
come
back
with
prisoners.
I
saw
their
badges.
ThereвЂ™s
a
Glover,
from
Deepwood
Motte,
heвЂ™s
my
fatherвЂ™s
man.
The
rest
too,
mostly.вЂќ
All
of
a
sudden,
Arya
knew
why
her
feet
had
brought
her
here.
вЂњYou
have
to
help
me
get
them
out.вЂќ

Gendry
laughed.
вЂњAnd
how
do
we
do
that?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Amory
sent
them
down
to
the
dungeon.
The
one
under
the
WidowвЂ™s
Tower,
thatвЂ™s
just
one
big
cell.
You
could
smash
the
door
open
with
your
hammerвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWhile
the
guards
watch
and
make
bets
on
how
many
swings
it
will
take
me,
maybe?вЂќ

Arya
chewed
her
lips.
вЂњWeвЂ™d
need
to
kill
the
guards.вЂќ

вЂњHow
are
we
supposed
to
do
that?вЂќ

вЂњMaybe
there
wonвЂ™t
be
a
lot
of
them.вЂќ

вЂњIf
thereвЂ™s
two,
thatвЂ™s
too
many
for
you
and
me.
You
never
learned
nothing
in
that
village,
did
you?
You
try
this
and
Vargo
Hoat
will
cut
off
your
hands
and
feet,
the
way
he
does.вЂќ
Gendry
took
up
the
tongs
again.

вЂњYouвЂ™re
afraid.вЂќ

вЂњLeave
me
alone,
girl.вЂќ

вЂњGendry,
thereвЂ™s
a
hundred
northmen.
Maybe
more,
I
couldnвЂ™t
count
them
all.
ThatвЂ™s
as
many
as
Ser
Amory
has.
Well,
not
counting
the
Bloody
Mummers.
We
just
have
to
get
them
out
and
we
can
take
over
the
castle
and
escape.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
you
canвЂ™t
get
them
out,
no
moreвЂ™n
you
could
save
Lommy.вЂќ
Gendry
turned
the
breastplate
with
the
tongs
to
look
at
it
closely.
вЂњAnd
if
we
did
escape,
where
would
we
go?вЂќ

вЂњWinterfell,вЂќ
she
said
at
once.
вЂњIвЂ™d
tell
Mother
how
you
helped
me,
and
you
could
stayвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњWould
mвЂ™lady
permit?
Could
I
shoe
your
horses
for
you,
and
make
swords
for
your
lordly
brothers?вЂќ

Sometimes
he
made
her
so
angry.
вЂњYou
stop
that!вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
I
wager
my
feet
for
the
chance
to
sweat
in
Winterfell
in
place
of
Harrenhal?
You
know
old
Ben
Blackthumb?
He
came
here
as
a
boy.
Smithed
for
Lady
Whent
and
her
father
before
her
and
his
father
before
him,
and
even
for
Lord
Lothston
who
held
Harrenhal
before
the
Whents.
Now
he
smiths
for
Lord
Tywin,
and
you
know
what
he
says?
A
swordвЂ™s
a
sword,
a
helmвЂ™s
a
helm,
and
if
you
reach
in
the
fire
you
get
burned,
no
matter
who
youвЂ™re
serving.
LucanвЂ™s
a
fair
enough
master.
IвЂ™ll
stay
here.вЂќ

вЂњThe
queen
will
catch
you,
then.
She
didnвЂ™t
send
gold
cloaks
after
Ben
Blackthumb!вЂќ

вЂњLikely
it
wasnвЂ™t
even
me
they
wanted.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
too,
you
know
it.
YouвЂ™re
somebody.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
a
вЂ™prentice
smith,
and
one
day
might
be
IвЂ™ll
make
a
master
armorerвЂ¦
if
I
donвЂ™t
run
off
and
lose
my
feet
or
get
myself
killed.вЂќ
He
turned
away
from
her,
picked
up
his
hammer
once
more,
and
began
to
bang.

AryaвЂ™s
hands
curled
into
helpless
fists.
вЂњThe
next
helm
you
make,
put
muleвЂ™s
ears
on
it
in
place
of
bullвЂ™s
horns!вЂќ
She
had
to
flee,
or
else
she
would
have
started
hitting
him.
He
probably
wouldnвЂ™t
even
feel
it
if
I
did.
When
they
find
who
he
is
and
cut
off
his
stupid
mulehead,
heвЂ™ll
be
sorry
he
didnвЂ™t
help.
She
was
better
off
without
him
anyhow.
He
was
the
one
who
got
her
caught
at
the
village.

But
thinking
of
the
village
made
her
remember
the
march,
and
the
storeroom,
and
the
Tickler.
She
thought
of
the
little
boy
whoвЂ™d
been
hit
in
the
face
with
the
mace,
of
stupid
old
All-for-Joffrey,
of
Lommy
Greenhands.
I
was
a
sheep,
and
then
I
was
a
mouse,
I
couldnвЂ™t
do
anything
but
hide.
Arya
chewed
her
lip
and
tried
to
think
when
her
courage
had
come
back.
Jaqen
made
me
brave
again.
He
made
me
a
ghost
instead
of
a
mouse.

She
had
been
avoiding
the
Lorathi
since
WeeseвЂ™s
death.
Chiswyck
had
been
easy,
anyone
could
push
a
man
off
the
wallwalk,
but
Weese
had
raised
that
ugly
spotted
dog
from
a
pup,
and
only
some
dark
magic
could
have
turned
the
animal
against
him.
Yoren
found
Jaqen
in
a
black
cell,
the
same
as
Rorge
and
Biter,
she
remembered.
Jaqen
did
something
horrible
and
Yoren
knew,
thatвЂ™s
why
he
kept
him
in
chains.
If
the
Lorathi
was
a
wizard,
Rorge
and
Biter
could
be
demons
he
called
up
from
some
hell,
not
men
at
all.

Jaqen
still
owed
her
one
death.
In
Old
NanвЂ™s
stories
about
men
who
were
given
magic
wishes
by
a
grumkin,
you
had
to
be
especially
careful
with
the
third
wish,
because
it
was
the
last.
Chiswyck
and
Weese
hadnвЂ™t
been
very
important.
The
last
death
has
to
count,
Arya
told
herself
every
night
when
she
whispered
her
names.
But
now
she
wondered
if
that
was
truly
the
reason
she
had
hesitated.
So
long
as
she
could
kill
with
a
whisper,
Arya
need
not
be
afraid
of
anyoneвЂ¦
but
once
she
used
up
the
last
death,
she
would
only
be
a
mouse
again.

With
Pinkeye
awake,
she
dared
not
go
back
to
her
bed.
Not
knowing
where
else
to
hide,
she
made
for
the
godswood.
She
liked
the
sharp
smell
of
the
pines
and
sentinels,
the
feel
of
grass
and
dirt
between
her
toes,
and
the
sound
the
wind
made
in
the
leaves.
A
slow
little
stream
meandered
through
the
wood,
and
there
was
one
spot
where
it
had
eaten
the
ground
away
beneath
a
deadfall.

There,
beneath
rotting
wood
and
twisted
splintered
branches,
she
found
her
hidden
sword.

Gendry
was
too
stubborn
to
make
one
for
her,
so
she
had
made
her
own
by
breaking
the
bristles
off
a
broom.
Her
blade
was
much
too
light
and
had
no
proper
grip,
but
she
liked
the
sharp
jagged
splintery
end.

Whenever
she
had
a
free
hour
she
stole
away
to
work
at
the
drills
Syrio
had
taught
her,
moving
barefoot
over
the
fallen
leaves,
slashing
at
branches
and
whacking
down
leaves.
Sometimes
she
even
climbed
the
trees
and
danced
among
the
upper
branches,
her
toes
gripping
the
limbs
as
she
moved
back
and
forth,
teetering
a
little
less
every
day
as
her
balance
returned
to
her.
Night
was
the
best
time;
no
one
ever
bothered
her
at
night.

Arya
climbed.
Up
in
the
kingdom
of
the
leaves,
she
unsheathed
and
for
a
time
forgot
them
all,
Ser
Amory
and
the
Mummers
and
her
fatherвЂ™s
men
alike,
losing
herself
in
the
feel
of
rough
wood
beneath
the
soles
of
her
feet
and
the
swish
of
sword
through
air.
A
broken
branch
became
Joffrey.
She
struck
at
it
until
it
fell
away.
The
queen
and
Ser
Ilyn
and
Ser
Meryn
and
the
Hound
were
only
leaves,
but
she
killed
them
all
as
well,
slashing
them
to
wet
green
ribbons.
When
her
arm
grew
weary,
she
sat
with
her
legs
over
a
high
limb
to
catch
her
breath
in
the
cool
dark
air,
listening
to
the
squeak
of
bats
as
they
hunted.
Through
the
leafy
canopy
she
could
see
the
bone-white
branches
of
the
heart
tree.
It
looks
just
like
the
one
in
Winterfell
from
here.
If
only
it
had
beenвЂ¦
then
when
she
climbed
down
she
would
have
been
home
again,
and
maybe
find
her
father
sitting
under
the
weirwood
where
he
always
sat.

Shoving
her
sword
through
her
belt,
she
slipped
down
branch
to
branch
until
she
was
back
on
the
ground.
The
light
of
the
moon
painted
the
limbs
of
the
weirwood
silvery
white
as
she
made
her
way
toward
it,
but
the
five-pointed
red
leaves
turned
black
by
night.
Arya
stared
at
the
face
carved
into
its
trunk.
It
was
a
terrible
face,
its
mouth
twisted,
its
eyes
flaring
and
full
of
hate.
Is
that
what
a
god
looked
like?
Could
gods
be
hurt,
the
same
as
people?
I
should
pray,
she
thought
suddenly.

Arya
went
to
her
knees.
She
wasnвЂ™t
sure
how
she
should
begin.
She
clasped
her
hands
together.
Help
me,
you
old
gods,
she
prayed
silently.
Help
me
get
those
men
out
of
the
dungeon
so
we
can
kill
Ser
Amory,
and
bring
me
home
to
Winterfell.
Make
me
a
water
dancer
and
a
wolf
and
not
afraid
again,
ever.

Was
that
enough?
Maybe
she
should
pray
aloud
if
she
wanted
the
old
gods
to
hear.
Maybe
she
should
pray
longer.
Sometimes
her
father
had
prayed
a
long
time,
she
remembered.
But
the
old
gods
had
never
helped
him.
Remembering
that
made
her
angry.
вЂњYou
should
have
saved
him,вЂќ
she
scolded
the
tree.
вЂњHe
prayed
to
you
all
the
time.
I
donвЂ™t
care
if
you
help
me
or
not.
I
donвЂ™t
think
you
could
even
if
you
wanted
to.вЂќ

вЂњGods
are
not
mocked,
girl.вЂќ

The
voice
startled
her.
She
leapt
to
her
feet
and
drew
her
wooden
sword.
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
stood
so
still
in
the
darkness
that
he
seemed
one
of
the
trees.
вЂњA
man
comes
to
hear
a
name.
One
and
two
and
then
comes
three.
A
man
would
have
done.вЂќ

Arya
lowered
the
splintery
point
toward
the
ground.
вЂњHow
did
you
know
I
was
here?вЂќ

вЂњA
man
sees.
A
man
hears.
A
man
knows.вЂќ

She
regarded
him
suspiciously.
Had
the
gods
sent
him?
вЂњHowвЂ™d
you
make
the
dog
kill
Weese?
Did
you
call
Rorge
and
Biter
up
from
hell?
Is
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
your
true
name?вЂќ

вЂњSome
men
have
many
names.
Weasel.
Arry.
Arya.вЂќ

She
backed
away
from
him,
until
she
was
pressed
against
the
heart
tree.
вЂњDid
Gendry
tell?вЂќ

вЂњA
man
knows,вЂќ
he
said
again.
вЂњMy
lady
of
Stark.вЂќ

Maybe
the
gods
had
sent
him
in
answer
to
her
prayers.
вЂњI
need
you
to
help
me
get
those
men
out
of
the
dungeons.
That
Glover
and
those
others,
all
of
them.
We
have
to
kill
the
guards
and
open
the
cell
somehowвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњA
girl
forgets,вЂќ
he
said
quietly.
вЂњTwo
she
has
had,
three
were
owed.
If
a
guard
must
die,
she
needs
only
speak
his
name.вЂќ

вЂњBut
one
guard
wonвЂ™t
be
enough,
we
need
to
kill
them
all
to
open
the
cell.вЂќ
Arya
bit
her
lip
hard
to
stop
from
crying.
вЂњI
want
you
to
save
the
northmen
like
I
saved
you.вЂќ

He
looked
down
at
her
pitilessly.
вЂњThree
lives
were
snatched
from
a
god.
Three
lives
must
be
repaid.
The
gods
are
not
mocked.вЂќ
His
voice
was
silk
and
steel.

вЂњI
never
mocked.вЂќ
She
thought
for
a
moment.
вЂњThe
nameвЂ¦
can
I
name
anyone?
And
youвЂ™ll
kill
him?вЂќ

Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
inclined
his
head.
вЂњA
man
has
said.вЂќ

вЂњAnyone?вЂќ
she
repeated.
вЂњA
man,
a
woman,
a
little
baby,
or
Lord
Tywin,
or
the
High
Septon,
or
your
father?вЂќ

вЂњA
manвЂ™s
sire
is
long
dead,
but
did
he
live,
and
did
you
know
his
name,
he
would
die
at
your
command.вЂќ

вЂњSwear
it,вЂќ
Arya
said.
вЂњSwear
it
by
the
gods.вЂќ

вЂњBy
all
the
gods
of
sea
and
air,
and
even
him
of
fire,
I
swear
it.вЂќ
He
placed
a
hand
in
the
mouth
of
the
weirwood.
вЂњBy
the
seven
new
gods
and
the
old
gods
beyond
count,
I
swear
it.вЂќ

He
has
sworn.
вЂњEven
if
I
named
the
kingвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSpeak
the
name,
and
death
will
come.
On
the
morrow,
at
the
turn
of
the
moon,
a
year
from
this
day,
it
will
come.
A
man
does
not
fly
like
a
bird,
but
one
foot
moves
and
then
another
and
one
day
a
man
is
there,
and
a
king
dies.вЂќ
He
knelt
beside
her,
so
they
were
face-to-face,
вЂњA
girl
whispers
if
she
fears
to
speak
aloud.
Whisper
it
now.
Is
it
Joffrey?вЂќ

Arya
put
her
lips
to
his
ear.
вЂњItвЂ™s
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar.вЂќ

Even
in
the
burning
barn,
with
walls
of
flame
towering
all
around
and
him
in
chains,
he
had
not
seemed
so
distraught
as
he
did
now.
вЂњA
girlвЂ¦
she
makes
a
jest.вЂќ

вЂњYou
swore.
The
gods
heard
you
swear.вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods
did
hear,вЂќ
There
was
a
knife
in
his
hand
suddenly,
its
blade
thin
as
her
little
finger.
Whether
it
was
meant
for
her
or
him,
Arya
could
not
say.
вЂњA
girl
will
weep.
A
girl
will
lose
her
only
friend.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
not
my
friend.
A
friend
would
help
me.вЂќ
She
stepped
away
from
him,
balanced
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
in
case
he
threw
his
knife.
вЂњIвЂ™d
never
kill
a
friend.вЂќ

JaqenвЂ™s
smile
came
and
went.
вЂњA
girl
mightвЂ¦
name
another
name
then,
if
a
friend
did
help?вЂќ

вЂњA
girl
might,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњIf
a
friend
did
help.вЂќ

The
knife
vanished.
вЂњCome.вЂќ

вЂњNow?вЂќ
She
had
never
thought
he
would
act
so
quickly.

вЂњA
man
hears
the
whisper
of
sand
in
a
glass.
A
man
will
not
sleep
until
a
girl
unsays
a
certain
name.
Now,
evil
child.вЂќ

IвЂ™m
not
an
evil
child,
she
thought,
I
am
a
direwolf,
and
the
ghost
in
Harrenhal.
She
put
her
broomstick
back
in
its
hiding
place
and
followed
him
from
the
godswood.

Despite
the
hour,
Harrenhal
stirred
with
fitful
life.
Vargo
HoatвЂ™s
arrival
had
thrown
off
all
the
routines.
Ox
carts,
oxen,
and
horses
had
all
vanished
from
the
yard,
but
the
bear
cage
was
still
there.
It
had
been
hung
from
the
arched
span
of
the
bridge
that
divided
the
outer
and
middle
wards,
suspended
on
heavy
chains,
a
few
feet
off
the
ground.
A
ring
of
torches
bathed
the
area
in
light.
Some
of
the
boys
from
the
stables
were
tossing
stones
to
make
the
bear
roar
and
grumble.
Across
the
ward,
light
spilled
through
the
door
of
the
Barracks
Hall,
accompanied
by
the
clatter
of
tankards
and
men
calling
for
more
wine.
A
dozen
voices
took
up
a
song
in
a
guttural
tongue
strange
to
AryaвЂ™s
ears.

TheyвЂ™re
drinking
and
eating
before
they
sleep,
she
realized.
Pinkeye
would
have
sent
to
wake
me,
to
help
with
the
serving.
HeвЂ™ll
know
IвЂ™m
not
abed.
But
likely
he
was
busy
pouring
for
the
Brave
Companions
and
those
of
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
garrison
who
had
joined
them.
The
noise
they
were
making
would
be
a
good
distraction.

вЂњThe
hungry
gods
will
feast
on
blood
tonight,
if
a
man
would
do
this
thing,вЂќ
Jaqen
said.
вЂњSweet
girl,
kind
and
gentle.
Unsay
one
name
and
say
another
and
cast
this
mad
dream
aside.вЂќ

вЂњI
wonвЂ™t.вЂќ

вЂњJust
so.вЂќ
He
seemed
resigned.
вЂњThe
thing
will
be
done,
but
a
girl
must
obey.
A
man
has
no
time
for
talk.вЂќ

вЂњA
girl
will
obey,вЂќ
Arya
said.
вЂњWhat
should
I
do?вЂќ

вЂњA
hundred
men
are
hungry,
they
must
be
fed,
the
lord
commands
hot
broth.
A
girl
must
run
to
the
kitchens
and
tell
her
pie
boy.вЂќ

вЂњBroth,вЂќ
she
repeated.
вЂњWhere
will
you
be?вЂќ

вЂњA
girl
will
help
make
broth,
and
wait
in
the
kitchens
until
a
man
comes
for
her.
Go.
Run.вЂќ

Hot
Pie
was
pulling
his
loaves
from
the
ovens
when
she
burst
into
the
kitchen,
but
he
was
no
longer
alone.
TheyвЂ™d
woken
the
cooks
to
feed
Vargo
Hoat
and
his
Bloody
Mummers.
Serving
men
were
carrying
off
baskets
of
Hot
PieвЂ™s
bread
and
tarts,
the
chief
cook
was
carving
cold
slices
off
a
ham,
spit
boys
were
turning
rabbits
while
the
pot
girls
basted
them
with
honey,
women
were
chopping
onions
and
carrots.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want,
Weasel?вЂќ
the
chief
cook
asked
when
he
saw
her.

вЂњBroth,вЂќ
she
announced.
вЂњMy
lord
wants
broth.вЂќ

He
jerked
his
carving
knife
at
the
black
iron
kettles
hung
over
the
flames.
вЂњWhat
do
you
think
that
is?
Though
IвЂ™d
soon
as
piss
in
it
as
serve
it
to
that
goat.
CanвЂ™t
even
let
a
man
have
a
nightвЂ™s
sleep.вЂќ
He
spat.
вЂњWell,
never
you
mind,
run
back
and
tell
him
a
kettle
canвЂ™t
be
hurried,вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
to
wait
here
until
itвЂ™s
done.вЂќ

вЂњThen
stay
out
of
the
way.
Or
better
yet,
make
yourself
of
use.
Run
to
the
buttery;
his
goatship
will
be
wanting
butter
and
cheese.
Wake
up
Pia
and
tell
her
sheвЂ™d
best
be
nimble
for
once,
if
she
wants
to
keep
both
of
her
feet.вЂќ

She
ran
as
fast
as
she
could.
Pia
was
awake
in
the
loft,
moaning
under
one
of
the
Mummers,
but
she
slipped
back
into
her
clothes
quick
enough
when
she
heard
Arya
shout.
She
filled
six
baskets
with
crocks
of
butter
and
big
wedges
of
stinky
cheese
wrapped
in
cloth.
вЂњHere,
help
me
with
these,вЂќ
she
told
Arya.

вЂњI
canвЂ™t.
But
you
better
hurry
or
Vargo
Hoat
will
chop
off
your
foot.вЂќ
She
darted
off
before
Pia
could
grab
her.
On
the
way
back,
she
wondered
why
none
of
the
captives
had
their
hands
or
feet
chopped
off.
Maybe
Vargo
Hoat
was
afraid
to
make
Robb
angry.
Though
he
didnвЂ™t
seem
the
sort
to
be
afraid
of
anyone.

Hot
Pie
was
stirring
the
kettles
with
a
long
wooden
spoon
when
Arya
returned
to
the
kitchens.
She
grabbed
up
a
second
spoon
and
started
to
help.
For
a
moment
she
thought
maybe
she
should
tell
him,
but
then
she
remembered
the
village
and
decided
not
to.
HeвЂ™d
only
yield
again.

Then
she
heard
the
ugly
sound
of
RorgeвЂ™s
voice.
вЂњCook,вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
take
your
bloody
broth.вЂќ
Arya
let
go
of
the
spoon
in
dismay.
I
never
told
him
to
bring
them.
Rorge
wore
his
iron
helmet,
with
the
nasal
that
half
hid
his
missing
nose.
Jaqen
and
Biter
followed
him
into
the
kitchen.

вЂњThe
bloody
broth
isnвЂ™t
bloody
ready
yet,вЂќ
the
cook
said.
вЂњIt
needs
to
simmer.
We
only
now
put
in
the
onions
andвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњShut
your
hole,
or
IвЂ™ll
shove
a
spit
up
your
ass
and
weвЂ™ll
baste
you
for
a
turn
or
two.
I
said
broth
and
I
said
now.вЂќ

Hissing,
Biter
grabbed
a
handful
of
half-charred
rabbit
right
off
the
spit,
and
tore
into
it
with
his
pointed
teeth
while
honey
dripped
between
his
fingers.

The
cook
was
beaten.
вЂњTake
your
bloody
broth,
then,
but
if
the
goat
asks
why
it
tastes
so
thin,
you
tell
him.вЂќ

Biter
licked
the
grease
and
honey
off
his
fingers
as
Jaqen
Hghar
donned
a
pair
of
heavy
padded
mitts.
He
gave
a
second
pair
to
Arya.
вЂњA
weasel
will
help.вЂќ
The
broth
was
boiling
hot,
and
the
kettles
were
heavy.
Arya
and
Jaqen
wrestled
one
between
them,
Rorge
carried
one
by
himself,
and
Biter
grabbed
two
more,
hissing
in
pain
when
the
handles
burned
his
hands.
Even
so,
he
did
not
drop
them.
They
lugged
the
kettles
out
of
the
kitchens
and
across
the
ward.
Two
guards
had
been
posted
at
the
door
of
the
WidowвЂ™s
Tower.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
this?вЂќ
one
said
to
Rorge.

вЂњA
pot
of
boiling
piss,
want
some?вЂќ

Jaqen
smiled
disarmingly.
вЂњA
prisoner
must
eat
too.вЂќ

вЂњNo
one
said
nothing
aboutвЂ”вЂќ

Arya
cut
him
off.
вЂњItвЂ™s
for
them,
not
you.вЂќ

The
second
guard
waved
them
past.
вЂњBring
it
down,
then.вЂќ

Inside
the
door
a
winding
stair
led
down
to
the
dungeons.
Rorge
led
the
way,
with
Jaqen
and
Arya
bringing
up
the
rear.
вЂњA
girl
will
stay
out
of
the
way,вЂќ
he
told
her.

The
steps
opened
onto
a
dank
stone
vault,
long,
gloomy,
and
windowless.
A
few
torches
burned
in
sconces
at
the
near
end
where
a
group
of
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
guards
sat
around
a
scarred
wooden
table,
talking
and
playing
at
tiles.
Heavy
iron
bars
separated
them
from
where
the
captives
were
crowded
together
in
the
dark.
The
smell
of
the
broth
brought
many
up
to
the
bars.

Arya
counted
eight
guards.
They
smelled
the
broth
as
well.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
the
ugliest
serving
wench
I
ever
saw,вЂќ
their
captain
said
to
Rorge.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
in
the
kettle?вЂќ

вЂњYour
cock
and
balls.
You
want
to
eat
or
not?вЂќ

One
of
the
guards
had
been
pacing,
one
standing
near
the
bars,
a
third
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
the
wall,
but
the
prospect
of
food
drew
all
of
them
to
the
table.

вЂњAbout
bloody
time
they
fed
us.вЂќ

вЂњThat
onions
I
smell?вЂќ

вЂњSo
whereвЂ™s
the
bread?вЂќ

вЂњFuck,
we
need
bowls,
cups,
spoonsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњNo
you
donвЂ™t.вЂќ
Rorge
heaved
the
scalding
hot
broth
across
the
table,
full
in
their
faces.
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
did
the
same.
Biter
threw
his
kettles
too,
swinging
them
underarm
so
they
spun
across
the
dungeon,
raining
soup.
One
caught
the
captain
in
the
temple
as
he
tried
to
rise.
He
went
down
like
a
sack
of
sand
and
lay
still.
The
rest
were
screaming
in
agony,
praying,
or
trying
to
crawl
off.

Arya
pressed
back
against
the
wall
as
Rorge
began
to
cut
throats.
Biter
preferred
to
grab
the
men
behind
the
head
and
under
the
chin
and
crack
their
necks
with
a
single
twist
of
his
huge
pale
hands.
Only
one
of
the
guards
managed
to
get
a
blade
out.
Jaqen
danced
away
from
his
slash,
drew
his
own
sword,
drove
the
man
back
into
a
corner
with
a
flurry
of
blows,
and
killed
him
with
a
thrust
to
the
heart.
The
Lorathi
brought
the
blade
to
Arya
still
red
with
heartвЂ™s
blood
and
wiped
it
clean
on
the
front
of
her
shift.
вЂњA
girl
should
be
bloody
too.
This
is
her
work.вЂќ

The
key
to
the
cell
hung
from
a
hook
on
the
wall
above
the
table.
Rorge
took
it
down
and
opened
the
door.
The
first
man
through
was
the
lord
with
the
mailed
fist
on
his
surcoat.
вЂњWell
done,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњI
am
Robett
Glover.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord.вЂќ
Jaqen
gave
him
a
bow.

Once
freed,
the
captives
stripped
the
dead
guards
of
their
weapons
and
darted
up
the
steps
with
steel
in
hand.
Their
fellows
crowded
after
them,
bare-handed.
They
went
swiftly,
and
with
scarcely
a
word.
None
of
them
seemed
quite
so
badly
wounded
as
they
had
when
Vargo
Hoat
had
marched
them
through
the
gates
of
Harrenhal.
вЂњThis
of
the
soup,
that
was
clever,вЂќ
the
man
Glover
was
saying.
вЂњI
did
not
expect
that.
Was
it
Lord
HoatвЂ™s
idea?вЂќ

Rorge
began
to
laugh.
He
laughed
so
hard
that
snot
flew
out
the
hole
where
his
nose
had
been.
Biter
sat
on
top
of
one
of
the
dead
men,
holding
a
limp
hand
as
he
gnawed
at
the
fingers.
Bones
cracked
between
his
teeth.

вЂњWho
are
you
men?вЂќ
A
crease
appeared
between
Robett
GloverвЂ™s
brows.
вЂњYou
were
not
with
Hoat
when
he
came
to
Lord
BoltonвЂ™s
encampment.
Are
you
of
the
Brave
Companions?вЂќ

Rorge
wiped
the
snot
off
his
chin
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
вЂњWe
are
now.вЂќ

вЂњThis
man
has
the
honor
to
be
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
once
of
the
Free
City
of
Lorath.
This
manвЂ™s
discourteous
companions
are
named
Rorge
and
Biter.
A
lord
will
know
which
is
Biter.вЂќ
He
waved
a
hand
toward
Arya.
вЂњAnd
hereвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
Weasel,вЂќ
she
blurted,
before
he
could
tell
who
she
really
was.
She
did
not
want
her
name
said
here,
where
Rorge
might
hear,
and
Biter,
and
all
these
others
she
did
not
know.

She
saw
Glover
dismiss
her.
вЂњVery
well,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњLetвЂ™s
make
an
end
to
this
bloody
business.вЂќ

When
they
climbed
back
up
the
winding
stair,
they
found
the
door
guards
lying
in
pools
of
their
own
blood.
Northmen
were
running
across
the
ward.
Arya
heard
shouts.
The
door
of
Barracks
Hall
burst
open
and
a
wounded
man
staggered
out
screaming.
Three
others
ran
after
him
and
silenced
him
with
spear
and
sword.
There
was
fighting
around
the
gatehouse
as
well.
Rorge
and
Biter
rushed
off
with
Glover,
but
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar
knelt
beside
Arya.
вЂњA
girl
does
not
understand?вЂќ

вЂњYes
I
do,вЂќ
she
said,
though
she
didnвЂ™t,
not
truly.

The
Lorathi
must
have
seen
it
on
her
face.
вЂњA
goat
has
no
loyalty.
Soon
a
wolf
banner
is
raised
here,
I
think.
But
first
a
man
would
hear
a
certain
name
unsaid.вЂќ

вЂњI
take
back
the
name.вЂќ
Arya
chewed
her
lip.
вЂњDo
I
still
have
a
third
death?вЂќ

вЂњA
girl
is
greedy.вЂќ
Jaqen
touched
one
of
the
dead
guards
and
showed
her
his
bloody
fingers.
вЂњHere
is
three
and
there
is
four
and
eight
more
lie
dead
below.
The
debt
is
paid.вЂќ

вЂњThe
debt
is
paid,вЂќ
Arya
agreed
reluctantly.
She
felt
a
little
sad.
Now
she
was
just
a
mouse
again.

вЂњA
god
has
his
due.
And
now
a
man
must
die.вЂќ
A
strange
smile
touched
the
lips
of
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar.

вЂњDie?вЂќ
she
said,
confused.
What
did
he
mean?
вЂњBut
I
unsaid
the
name.
You
donвЂ™t
need
to
die
now.вЂќ

вЂњI
do.
My
time
is
done.вЂќ
Jaqen
passed
a
hand
down
his
face
from
forehead
to
chin,
and
where
it
went
he
changed.
His
cheeks
grew
fuller,
his
eyes
closer;
his
nose
hooked,
a
scar
appeared
on
his
right
cheek
where
no
scar
had
been
before.
And
when
he
shook
his
head,
his
long
straight
hair,
half
red
and
half
white,
dissolved
away
to
reveal
a
cap
of
tight
black
curls.

AryaвЂ™s
mouth
hung
open.
вЂњWho
are
you?вЂќ
she
whispered,
too
astonished
to
be
afraid.
вЂњHow
did
you
do
that?
Was
it
hard?вЂќ

He
grinned,
revealing
a
shiny
gold
tooth.
вЂњNo
harder
than
taking
a
new
name,
if
you
know
the
way.вЂќ

вЂњShow
me,вЂќ
she
blurted.
вЂњI
want
to
do
it
too.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
would
learn,
you
must
come
with
me.вЂќ

Arya
grew
hesitant.
вЂњWhere?вЂќ

вЂњFar
and
away,
across
the
narrow
sea.вЂќ

вЂњI
canвЂ™t.
I
have
to
go
home.
To
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњThen
we
must
part,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњfor
I
have
duties
too.вЂќ
He
lifted
her
hand
and
pressed
a
small
coin
into
her
palm.
вЂњHere.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
is
it?вЂќ

вЂњA
coin
of
great
value.вЂќ

Arya
bit
it.
It
was
so
hard
it
could
only
be
iron.
вЂњIs
it
worth
enough
to
buy
a
horse?вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
not
meant
for
the
buying
of
horses.вЂќ

вЂњThen
what
good
is
it?вЂќ

вЂњAs
well
ask
what
good
is
life,
what
good
is
death?
If
the
day
comes
when
you
would
find
me
again,
give
that
coin
to
any
man
from
Braavos,
and
say
these
words
to
himвЂ”valar
morghulis.вЂќ

вЂњValar
morghulis,вЂќ
Arya
repeated.
It
wasnвЂ™t
hard.
Her
fingers
closed
tight
over
the
coin.
Across
the
yard,
she
could
hear
men
dying.
вЂњPlease
donвЂ™t
go,
Jaqen.вЂќ

вЂњJaqen
is
as
dead
as
Arry,вЂќ
he
said
sadly,
вЂњand
I
have
promises
to
keep.
Valar
morghulis,
Arya
Stark.
Say
it
again.вЂќ

вЂњValar
morghulis,вЂќ
she
said
once
more,
and
the
stranger
in
JaqenвЂ™s
clothes
bowed
to
her
and
stalked
off
through
the
darkness,
cloak
swirling.
She
was
alone
with
the
dead
men.
They
deserved
to
die,
Arya
told
herself,
remembering
all
those
Ser
Amory
Lorch
had
killed
at
the
holdfast
by
the
lake.

The
cellars
under
Kingspyre
were
empty
when
she
returned
to
her
bed
of
straw.
She
whispered
her
names
to
her
pillow,
and
when
she
was
done
she
added,
вЂњValar
morghulis,вЂќ
in
a
small
soft
voice,
wondering
what
it
meant.

Come
dawn,
Pinkeye
and
the
others
were
back,
all
but
one
boy
whoвЂ™d
been
killed
in
the
fighting
for
no
reason
that
anyone
could
say.
Pinkeye
went
up
alone
to
see
how
matters
stood
by
light
of
day,
complaining
all
the
while
that
his
old
bones
could
not
abide
steps.
When
he
returned,
he
told
them
that
Harrenhal
had
been
taken.
вЂњThem
Bloody
Mummers
killed
some
of
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
lot
in
their
beds,
and
the
rest
at
table
after
they
were
good
and
drunk.
The
new
lord
will
be
here
before
the
dayвЂ™s
out,
with
his
whole
host.
HeвЂ™s
from
the
wild
north
up
where
that
Wall
is,
and
they
say
heвЂ™s
a
hard
one.
This
lord
or
that
lord,
thereвЂ™s
still
work
to
be
done.
Any
foolery
and
IвЂ™ll
whip
the
skin
off
your
back.вЂќ
He
looked
at
Arya
when
he
said
that,
but
never
said
a
word
to
her
about
where
she
had
been
the
night
before.

All
morning
she
watched
the
Bloody
Mummers
strip
the
dead
of
their
valuables
and
drag
the
corpses
to
the
Flowstone
Yard,
where
a
pyre
was
laid
to
dispose
of
them.
Shagwell
the
Fool
hacked
the
heads
off
two
dead
knights
and
pranced
about
the
castle
swinging
them
by
the
hair
and
making
them
talk.
вЂњWhat
did
you
die
of?вЂќ
one
head
asked.
вЂњHot
weasel
soup,вЂќ
replied
the
second.

Arya
was
set
to
mopping
up
dried
blood.
No
one
said
a
word
to
her
beyond
the
usual,
but
every
so
often
she
would
notice
people
looking
at
her
strangely.
Robett
Glover
and
the
other
men
theyвЂ™d
freed
must
have
talked
about
what
had
happened
down
in
the
dungeon,
and
then
Shagwell
and
his
stupid
talking
heads
started
in
about
the
weasel
soup.
She
would
have
told
him
to
shut
up,
but
she
was
scared
to.
The
fool
was
half-mad,
and
sheвЂ™d
heard
that
heвЂ™d
once
killed
a
man
for
not
laughing
at
one
of
his
japes.
He
better
shut
his
mouth
or
IвЂ™ll
put
him
on
my
list
with
the
rest,
she
thought
as
she
scrubbed
at
a
reddish-brown
stain.
It
was
almost
evenfall
when
the
new
master
of
Harrenhal
arrived.
He
had
a
plain
face,
beardless
and
ordinary,
notable
only
for
his
queer
pale
eyes.
Neither
plump,
thin,
nor
muscular,
he
wore
black
ringmail
and
a
spotted
pink
cloak.
The
sigil
on
his
banner
looked
like
a
man
dipped
in
blood.
вЂњOn
your
knees
for
the
Lord
of
the
Dreadfort!вЂќ
shouted
his
squire,
a
boy
no
older
than
Arya,
and
Harrenhal
knelt.

Vargo
Hoat
came
forward.
вЂњMy
lord,
Harrenhal
ith
yourth.вЂќ

The
lord
gave
answer,
but
too
softly
for
Arya
to
hear.
Robett
Glover
and
Ser
Aenys
Frey,
freshly
bathed
and
clad
in
clean
new
doublets
and
cloaks,
came
up
to
join
them.
After
some
brief
talk,
Ser
Aenys
led
them
over
to
Rorge
and
Biter.
Arya
was
surprised
to
see
them
still
here;
somehow
she
would
have
expected
them
to
vanish
when
Jaqen
did.
Arya
heard
the
harsh
sound
of
RorgeвЂ™s
voice,
but
not
what
he
was
saying.
Then
Shagwell
pounced
on
her,
dragging
her
out
across
the
yard.
вЂњMy
lord,
my
lord,вЂќ
he
sang,
tugging
at
her
wrist,
вЂњhereвЂ™s
the
weasel
who
made
the
soup!вЂќ

вЂњLet
go,вЂќ
Arya
said,
wriggling
out
of
his
grasp.

The
lord
regarded
her.
Only
his
eyes
moved;
they
were
very
pale,
the
color
of
ice.
вЂњHow
old
are
you,
child?вЂќ

She
had
to
think
for
a
moment
to
remember.
вЂњTen.вЂќ

вЂњTen,
my
lord,вЂќ
he
reminded
her.
вЂњAre
you
fond
of
animals?вЂќ

вЂњSome
kinds.
My
lord.вЂќ

A
thin
smile
twitched
across
his
lips.
вЂњBut
not
lions,
it
would
seem.
Nor
manticores.вЂќ

She
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that,
so
she
said
nothing.

вЂњThey
tell
me
you
are
called
Weasel.
That
will
not
serve.
What
name
did
your
mother
give
you?вЂќ

She
bit
her
lip,
groping
for
another
name.
Lommy
had
called
her
Lumpyhead,
Sansa
used
Horseface,
and
her
fatherвЂ™s
men
once
dubbed
her
Arya
Underfoot,
but
she
did
not
think
any
of
those
were
the
sort
of
name
he
wanted.

вЂњNymeria,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњOnly
she
called
me
Nan
for
short.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
call
me
my
lord
when
you
speak
to
me,
Nan,вЂќ
the
lord
said
mildly.
вЂњYou
are
too
young
to
be
a
Brave
Companion,
I
think,
and
of
the
wrong
sex.
Are
you
afraid
of
leeches,
child?вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™re
only
leeches.
My
lord.вЂќ

вЂњMy
squire
could
take
a
lesson
from
you,
it
would
seem.
Frequent
leechings
are
the
secret
of
a
long
life.
A
man
must
purge
himself
of
bad
blood.
You
will
do,
I
think.
For
so
long
as
I
remain
at
Harrenhal,
Nan,
you
shall
be
my
cupbearer,
and
serve
me
at
table
and
in
chambers.вЂќ

This
time
she
knew
better
than
to
say
that
sheвЂ™d
sooner
work
in
the
stables.
вЂњYes,
your
lord.
I
mean,
my
lord.вЂќ

The
lord
waved
a
hand.
вЂњMake
her
presentable,вЂќ
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular,
вЂњand
make
certain
she
knows
how
to
pour
wine
without
spilling
it.вЂќ
Turning
away,
he
lifted
a
hand
and
said,
вЂњLord
Hoat,
see
to
those
banners
above
the
gatehouse.вЂќ

Four
Brave
Companions
climbed
to
the
ramparts
and
hauled
down
the
lion
of
Lannister
and
Ser
AmoryвЂ™s
own
black
manticore.
In
their
place
they
raised
the
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort
and
the
direwolf
of
Stark.
And
that
evening,
a
page
named
Nan
poured
wine
for
Roose
Bolton
and
Vargo
Hoat
as
they
stood
on
the
gallery,
watching
the
Brave
Companions
parade
Ser
Amory
Lorch
naked
through
the
middle
ward.
Ser
Amory
pleaded
and
sobbed
and
clung
to
the
legs
of
his
captors,
until
Rorge
pulled
him
loose,
and
Shagwell
kicked
him
down
into
the
bear
pit.

The
bear
is
all
in
black,
Arya
thought.
Like
Yoren.
She
filled
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
cup,
and
did
not
spill
a
drop.





DAENERYS

In
this
city
of
splendors,
Dany
had
expected
the
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
to
be
the
most
splendid
of
all,
but
she
emerged
from
her
palanquin
to
behold
a
grey
and
ancient
ruin.

Long
and
low,
without
towers
or
windows,
it
coiled
like
a
stone
serpent
through
a
grove
of
black-barked
trees
whose
inky
blue
leaves
made
the
stuff
of
the
sorcerous
drink
the
Qartheen
called
shade
of
the
evening.
No
other
buildings
stood
near.
Black
tiles
covered
the
palace
roof,
many
fallen
or
broken;
the
mortar
between
the
stones
was
dry
and
crumbling.
She
understood
now
why
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
called
it
the
Palace
of
Dust.
Even
Drogon
seemed
disquieted
by
the
sight
of
it.
The
black
dragon
hissed,
smoke
seeping
out
between
his
sharp
teeth.

вЂњBlood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
Jhogo
said
in
Dothraki,
вЂњthis
is
an
evil
place,
a
haunt
of
ghosts
and
maegi.
See
how
it
drinks
the
morning
sun?
Let
us
go
before
it
drinks
us
as
well.вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
came
up
beside
them.
вЂњWhat
power
can
they
have
if
they
live
in
that?вЂќ

вЂњHeed
the
wisdom
of
those
who
love
you
best,вЂќ
said
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos,
lounging
inside
the
palanquin.
вЂњWarlocks
are
bitter
creatures
who
eat
dust
and
drink
of
shadows.
They
will
give
you
naught.
They
have
naught
to
give.вЂќ

Aggo
put
a
hand
on
his
arakh.
вЂњKhaleesi,
it
is
said
that
many
go
into
the
Palace
of
Dust,
but
few
come
out.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
said,вЂќ
Jhogo
agreed.

вЂњWe
are
blood
of
your
blood,вЂќ
said
Aggo,
вЂњsworn
to
live
and
die
as
you
do.
Let
us
walk
with
you
in
this
dark
place,
to
keep
you
safe
from
harm.вЂќ

вЂњSome
places
even
a
khal
must
walk
alone,вЂќ
Dany
said.

вЂњTake
me,
then,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
urged.
вЂњThe
riskвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњQueen
Daenerys
must
enter
alone,
or
not
at
all.вЂќ
The
warlock
Pyat
Pree
stepped
out
from
under
the
trees.
Has
he
been
there
all
along?
Dany
wondered.
вЂњShould
she
turn
away
now,
the
doors
of
wisdom
shall
be
closed
to
her
forevermore.вЂќ

вЂњMy
pleasure
barge
awaits,
even
now,вЂќ
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
called
out.
вЂњTurn
away
from
this
folly,
most
stubborn
of
queens.
I
have
flutists
who
will
soothe
your
troubled
soul
with
sweet
music,
and
a
small
girl
whose
tongue
will
make
you
sigh
and
melt.вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
gave
the
merchant
prince
a
sour
look.
вЂњYour
Grace,
remember
Mirri
Maz
Duur.вЂќ

вЂњI
do,вЂќ
Dany
said,
suddenly
decided.
вЂњI
remember
that
she
had
knowledge.
And
she
was
only
a
maegi.вЂќ

Pyat
Pree
smiled
thinly.
вЂњThe
child
speaks
as
sagely
as
a
crone.
Take
my
arm,
and
let
me
lead
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
no
child.вЂќ
Dany
took
his
arm
nonetheless.

It
was
darker
than
she
would
have
thought
under
the
black
trees,
and
the
way
was
longer.
Though
the
path
seemed
to
run
straight
from
the
street
to
the
door
of
the
palace,
Pyat
Pree
soon
turned
aside.
When
she
questioned
him,
the
warlock
said
only,
вЂњThe
front
way
leads
in,
but
never
out
again.
Heed
my
words,
my
queen.
The
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
was
not
made
for
mortal
men.
If
you
value
your
soul,
take
care
and
do
just
as
I
tell
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
do
as
you
say,вЂќ
Dany
promised.

вЂњWhen
you
enter,
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
room
with
four
doors:
the
one
you
have
come
through
and
three
others.
Take
the
door
to
your
right.
Each
time,
the
door
to
your
right.
If
you
should
come
upon
a
stairwell,
climb.
Never
go
down,
and
never
take
any
door
but
the
first
door
to
your
right.вЂќ

вЂњThe
door
to
my
right,вЂќ
Dany
repeated.
вЂњI
understand.
And
when
I
leave,
the
opposite?вЂќ

вЂњBy
no
means,вЂќ
Pyat
Pree
said.
вЂњLeaving
and
coming,
it
is
the
same.
Always
up.
Always
the
door
to
your
right.
Other
doors
may
open
to
you.
Within,
you
will
see
many
things
that
disturb
you.
Visions
of
loveliness
and
visions
of
horror,
wonders
and
terrors.
Sights
and
sounds
of
days
gone
by
and
days
to
come
and
days
that
never
were.
Dwellers
and
servitors
may
speak
to
you
as
you
go.
Answer
or
ignore
them
as
you
choose,
but
enter
no
room
until
you
reach
the
audience
chamber.вЂќ

вЂњI
understand.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
you
come
to
the
chamber
of
the
Undying,
be
patient.
Our
little
lives
are
no
more
than
a
flicker
of
a
mothвЂ™s
wing
to
them.
Listen
well,
and
write
each
word
upon
your
heart.вЂќ

When
they
reached
the
doorвЂ”a
tall
oval
mouth,
set
in
a
wall
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
a
human
faceвЂ”the
smallest
dwarf
Dany
had
ever
seen
was
waiting
on
the
threshold.
He
stood
no
higher
than
her
knee,
his
faced
pinched
and
pointed,
snoutish,
but
he
was
dressed
in
delicate
livery
of
purple
and
blue,
and
his
tiny
pink
hands
held
a
silver
tray.
Upon
it
rested
a
slender
crystal
glass
filled
with
a
thick
blue
liquid:
shade
of
the
evening,
the
wine
of
warlocks.
вЂњTake
and
drink,вЂќ
urged
Pyat
Pree.

вЂњWill
it
turn
my
lips
blue?вЂќ

вЂњOne
flute
will
serve
only
to
unstop
your
ears
and
dissolve
the
caul
from
off
your
eyes,
so
that
you
may
hear
and
see
the
truths
that
will
be
laid
before
you.вЂќ

Dany
raised
the
glass
to
her
lips.
The
first
sip
tasted
like
ink
and
spoiled
meat,
foul,
but
when
she
swallowed
it
seemed
to
come
to
life
within
her.
She
could
feel
tendrils
spreading
through
her
chest,
like
fingers
of
fire
coiling
around
her
heart,
and
on
her
tongue
was
a
taste
like
honey
and
anise
and
cream,
like
motherвЂ™s
milk
and
DrogoвЂ™s
seed,
like
red
meat
and
hot
blood
and
molten
gold.
It
was
all
the
tastes
she
had
ever
known,
and
none
of
themвЂ¦
and
then
the
glass
was
empty.

вЂњNow
you
may
enter,вЂќ
said
the
warlock.
Dany
put
the
glass
back
on
the
servitorвЂ™s
tray,
and
went
inside.

She
found
herself
in
a
stone
anteroom
with
four
doors,
one
on
each
wall.
With
never
a
hesitation,
she
went
to
the
door
on
her
right
and
stepped
through.
The
second
room
was
a
twin
to
the
first.
Again
she
turned
to
the
right-hand
door.
When
she
pushed
it
open
she
faced
yet
another
small
antechamber
with
four
doors.
I
am
in
the
presence
of
sorcery.

The
fourth
room
was
oval
rather
than
square
and
walled
in
worm-eaten
wood
in
place
of
stone.
Six
passages
led
out
from
it
in
place
of
four.
Dany
chose
the
rightmost,
and
entered
a
long,
dim,
high-ceilinged
hall.
Along
the
right
hand
was
a
row
of
torches
burning
with
a
smoky
orange
light,
but
the
only
doors
were
to
her
left.
Drogon
unfolded
wide
black
wings
and
beat
the
stale
air.
He
flew
twenty
feet
before
thudding
to
an
undignified
crash.
Dany
strode
after
him.

The
mold-eaten
carpet
under
her
feet
had
once
been
gorgeously
colored,
and
whorls
of
gold
could
still
be
seen
in
the
fabric,
glinting
broken
amidst
the
faded
grey
and
mottled
green.
What
remained
served
to
muffle
her
footfalls,
but
that
was
not
all
to
the
good.
Dany
could
hear
sounds
within
the
walls,
a
faint
scurrying
and
scrabbling
that
made
her
think
of
rats.
Drogon
heard
them
too.
His
head
moved
as
he
followed
the
sounds,
and
when
they
stopped
he
gave
an
angry
scream.
Other
sounds,
even
more
disturbing,
came
through
some
of
the
closed
doors.
One
shook
and
thumped,
as
if
someone
were
trying
to
break
through.
From
another
came
a
dissonant
piping
that
made
the
dragon
lash
his
tail
wildly
from
side
to
side.
Dany
hurried
quickly
past.

Not
all
the
doors
were
closed.
I
will
not
look,
Dany
told
herself,
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong.

In
one
room,
a
beautiful
woman
sprawled
naked
on
the
floor
while
four
little
men
crawled
over
her.
They
had
rattish
pointed
faces
and
tiny
pink
hands,
like
the
servitor
who
had
brought
her
the
glass
of
shade.
One
was
pumping
between
her
thighs.
Another
savaged
her
breasts,
worrying
at
the
nipples
with
his
wet
red
mouth,
tearing
and
chewing.

Farther
on
she
came
upon
a
feast
of
corpses.
Savagely
slaughtered,
the
feasters
lay
strewn
across
overturned
chairs
and
hacked
trestle
tables,
asprawl
in
pools
of
congealing
blood.
Some
had
lost
limbs,
even
heads.
Severed
hands
clutched
bloody
cups,
wooden
spoons,
roast
fowl,
heels
of
bread.
In
a
throne
above
them
sat
a
dead
man
with
the
head
of
a
wolf.
He
wore
an
iron
crown
and
held
a
leg
of
lamb
in
one
hand
as
a
king
might
hold
a
scepter,
and
his
eyes
followed
Dany
with
mute
appeal.

She
fled
from
him,
but
only
as
far
as
the
next
open
door.
I
know
this
room,
she
thought.
She
remembered
those
great
wooden
beams
and
the
carved
animal
faces
that
adorned
them.
And
there
outside
the
window,
a
lemon
tree!
The
sight
of
it
made
her
heart
ache
with
longing.
It
is
the
house
with
the
red
door,
the
house
in
Braavos.
No
sooner
had
she
thought
it
than
old
Ser
Willem
came
into
the
room,
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick.
вЂњLittle
princess,
there
you
are,вЂќ
he
said
in
his
gruff
kind
voice.
вЂњCome,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњcome
to
me,
my
lady,
youвЂ™re
home
now,
youвЂ™re
safe
now.вЂќ
His
big
wrinkled
hand
reached
for
her,
soft
as
old
leather,
and
Dany
wanted
to
take
it
and
hold
it
and
kiss
it,
she
wanted
that
as
much
as
she
had
ever
wanted
anything.
Her
foot
edged
forward,
and
then
she
thought,
HeвЂ™s
dead,
heвЂ™s
dead,
the
sweet
old
bear,
he
died
a
long
time
ago.
She
backed
away
and
ran.

The
long
hall
went
on
and
on
and
on,
with
endless
doors
to
her
left
and
only
torches
to
her
right.
She
ran
past
more
doors
than
she
could
count,
closed
doors
and
open
ones,
doors
of
wood
and
doors
of
iron,
carved
doors
and
plain
ones,
doors
with
pulls
and
doors
with
locks
and
doors
with
knockers.
Drogon
lashed
against
her
back,
urging
her
on,
and
Dany
ran
until
she
could
run
no
more.

Finally
a
great
pair
of
bronze
doors
appeared
to
her
left,
grander
than
the
rest.
They
swung
open
as
she
neared,
and
she
had
to
stop
and
look.
Beyond
loomed
a
cavernous
stone
hall,
the
largest
she
had
ever
seen.
The
skulls
of
dead
dragons
looked
down
from
its
walls.
Upon
a
towering
barbed
throne
sat
an
old
man
in
rich
robes,
an
old
man
with
dark
eyes
and
long
silver-grey
hair.
вЂњLet
him
be
king
over
charred
bones
and
cooked
meat,вЂќ
he
said
to
a
man
below
him.
вЂњLet
him
be
the
king
of
ashes.вЂќ
Drogon
shrieked,
his
claws
digging
through
silk
and
skin,
but
the
king
on
his
throne
never
heard,
and
Dany
moved
on.

Viserys,
was
her
first
thought
the
next
time
she
paused,
but
a
second
glance
told
her
otherwise.
The
man
had
her
brotherвЂ™s
hair,
but
he
was
taller,
and
his
eyes
were
a
dark
indigo
rather
than
lilac.
вЂњAegon,вЂќ
he
said
to
a
woman
nursing
a
newborn
babe
in
a
great
wooden
bed.
вЂњWhat
better
name
for
a
king?вЂќ

вЂњWill
you
make
a
song
for
him?вЂќ
the
woman
asked.

вЂњHe
has
a
song,вЂќ
the
man
replied.
вЂњHe
is
the
prince
that
was
promised,
and
his
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire.вЂќ
He
looked
up
when
he
said
it
and
his
eyes
met
DanyвЂ™s,
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
saw
her
standing
there
beyond
the
door.
вЂњThere
must
be
one
more,вЂќ
he
said,
though
whether
he
was
speaking
to
her
or
the
woman
in
the
bed
she
could
not
say.
вЂњThe
dragon
has
three
heads.вЂќ
He
went
to
the
window
seat,
picked
up
a
harp,
and
ran
his
fingers
lightly
over
its
silvery
strings.
Sweet
sadness
filled
the
room
as
man
and
wife
and
babe
faded
like
the
morning
mist,
only
the
music
lingering
behind
to
speed
her
on
her
way.

It
seemed
as
though
she
walked
for
another
hour
before
the
long
hall
finally
ended
in
a
steep
stone
stair,
descending
into
darkness.
Every
door,
open
or
closed,
had
been
to
her
left.
Dany
looked
back
behind
her.
The
torches
were
going
out,
she
realized
with
a
start
of
fear.
Perhaps
twenty
still
burned.
Thirty
at
most.
One
more
guttered
out
even
as
she
watched,
and
the
darkness
came
a
little
farther
down
the
hall,
creeping
toward
her.
And
as
she
listened
it
seemed
as
if
she
heard
something
else
coming,
shuffling
and
dragging
itself
slowly
along
the
faded
carpet.
Terror
filled
her.
She
could
not
go
back
and
she
was
afraid
to
stay
here,
but
how
could
she
go
on?
There
was
no
door
on
her
right,
and
the
steps
went
down,
not
up.

Yet
another
torch
went
out
as
she
stood
pondering,
and
the
sounds
grew
faintly
louder.
DrogonвЂ™s
long
neck
snaked
out
and
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
steam
rising
from
between
his
teeth.
He
hears
it
too.
Dany
turned
to
the
blank
wall
once
more,
but
there
was
nothing.
Could
there
be
a
secret
door,
a
door
I
cannot
see?
Another
torch
went
out.
Another.
The
first
door
on
the
right,
he
said,
always
the
first
door
on
the
right.
The
first
door
on
the
rightвЂ¦

It
came
to
her
suddenlyвЂ¦
is
the
last
door
on
the
left!

She
flung
herself
through.
Beyond
was
another
small
room
with
four
doors.
To
the
right
she
went,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
and
to
the
right,
until
she
was
dizzy
and
out
of
breath
once
more.

When
she
stopped,
she
found
herself
in
yet
another
dank
stone
chamberвЂ¦
but
this
time
the
door
opposite
was
round,
shaped
like
an
open
mouth,
and
Pyat
Pree
stood
outside
in
the
grass
beneath
the
trees.
вЂњCan
it
be
that
the
Undying
are
done
with
you
so
soon?вЂќ
he
asked
in
disbelief
when
he
saw
her.

вЂњSo
soon?вЂќ
she
said,
confused.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
walked
for
hours,
and
still
not
found
them.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
taken
a
wrong
turning.
Come,
I
will
lead
you.вЂќ
Pyat
Pree
held
out
his
hand.

Dany
hesitated.
There
was
a
door
to
her
right,
still
closedвЂ¦

вЂњThatвЂ™s
not
the
way,вЂќ
Pyat
Pree
said
firmly,
his
blue
lips
prim
with
disapproval.
вЂњThe
Undying
Ones
will
not
wait
forever.вЂќ

вЂњOur
little
lives
are
no
more
than
a
flicker
of
a
mothвЂ™s
wing
to
them,вЂќ
Dany
said,
remembering.

вЂњStubborn
child.
You
will
be
lost,
and
never
found.вЂќ

She
walked
away
from
him,
to
the
door
on
the
right.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Pyat
screeched.
вЂњNo,
to
me,
come
to
me,
to
meeeeeee.вЂќ
His
face
crumbled
inward,
changing
to
something
pale
and
wormlike.

Dany
left
him
behind,
entering
a
stairwell.
She
began
to
climb.
Before
long
her
legs
were
aching.
She
recalled
that
the
House
of
the
Undying
Ones
had
seemed
to
have
no
towers.

Finally
the
stair
opened.
To
her
right,
a
set
of
wide
wooden
doors
had
been
thrown
open.
They
were
fashioned
of
ebony
and
weirwood,
the
black
and
white
grains
swirling
and
twisting
in
strange
interwoven
patterns.
They
were
very
beautiful,
yet
somehow
frightening.
The
blood
of
the
dragon
must
not
be
afraid.
Dany
said
a
quick
prayer,
begging
the
Warrior
for
courage
and
the
Dothraki
horse
god
for
strength.
She
made
herself
walk
forward.

Beyond
the
doors
was
a
great
hall
and
a
splendor
of
wizards.
Some
wore
sumptuous
robes
of
ermine,
ruby
velvet,
and
cloth
of
gold.
Others
fancied
elaborate
armor
studded
with
gemstones,
or
tall
pointed
hats
speckled
with
stars.
There
were
women
among
them,
dressed
in
gowns
of
surpassing
loveliness.
Shafts
of
sunlight
slanted
through
windows
of
stained
glass,
and
the
air
was
alive
with
the
most
beautiful
music
she
had
ever
heard.

A
kingly
man
in
rich
robes
rose
when
he
saw
her,
and
smiled.
вЂњDaenerys
of
House
Targaryen,
be
welcome.
Come
and
share
the
food
of
forever.
We
are
the
Undying
of
Qarth.вЂќ

вЂњLong
have
we
awaited
you,вЂќ
said
a
woman
beside
him,
clad
in
rose
and
silver.
The
breast
she
had
left
bare
in
the
Qartheen
fashion
was
as
perfect
as
a
breast
could
be.

вЂњWe
knew
you
were
to
come
to
us,вЂќ
the
wizard
king
said.
вЂњA
thousand
years
ago
we
knew,
and
have
been
waiting
all
this
time.
We
sent
the
comet
to
show
you
the
way.вЂќ

вЂњWe
have
knowledge
to
share
with
you,вЂќ
said
a
warrior
in
shining
emerald
armor,
вЂњand
magic
weapons
to
arm
you
with.
You
have
passed
every
trial.
Now
come
and
sit
with
us,
and
all
your
questions
shall
be
answered.вЂќ

She
took
a
step
forward.
But
then
Drogon
leapt
from
her
shoulder.
He
flew
to
the
top
of
the
ebony-and-weirwood
door,
perched
there,
and
began
to
bite
at
the
carved
wood.

вЂњA
willful
beast,вЂќ
laughed
a
handsome
young
man.
вЂњShall
we
teach
you
the
secret
speech
of
dragonkind?
Come,
come.вЂќ

Doubt
seized
her.
The
great
door
was
so
heavy
it
took
all
of
DanyвЂ™s
strength
to
budge
it,
but
finally
it
began
to
move.
Behind
was
another
door,
hidden.
It
was
old
grey
wood,
splintery
and
plainвЂ¦
but
it
stood
to
the
right
of
the
door
through
which
sheвЂ™d
entered.
The
wizards
were
beckoning
her
with
voices
sweeter
than
song.
She
ran
from
them,
Drogon
flying
back
down
to
her.
Through
the
narrow
door
she
passed,
into
a
chamber
awash
in
gloom.

A
long
stone
table
filled
this
room.
Above
it
floated
a
human
heart,
swollen
and
blue
with
corruption,
yet
still
alive.
It
beat,
a
deep
ponderous
throb
of
sound,
and
each
pulse
sent
out
a
wash
of
indigo
light.
The
figures
around
the
table
were
no
more
than
blue
shadows.
As
Dany
walked
to
the
empty
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table,
they
did
not
stir,
nor
speak,
nor
turn
to
face
her.
There
was
no
sound
but
the
slow,
deep
beat
of
the
rotting
heart.

вЂ¦mother
of
dragonsвЂ¦
came
a
voice,
part
whisper
and
part
moanвЂ¦
dragonsвЂ¦
dragonsвЂ¦
dragonsвЂ¦
other
voices
echoed
in
the
gloom.
Some
were
male
and
some
female.
One
spoke
with
the
timbre
of
a
child.
The
floating
heart
pulsed
from
dimness
to
darkness.
It
was
hard
to
summon
the
will
to
speak,
to
recall
the
words
she
had
practiced
so
assiduously.
вЂњI
am
Daenerys
Stormborn
of
House
Targaryen,
Queen
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros.вЂќ
Do
they
hear
me?
Why
donвЂ™t
they
move?
She
sat,
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap.
вЂњGrant
me
your
counsel,
and
speak
to
me
with
the
wisdom
of
those
who
have
conquered
death.вЂќ

Through
the
indigo
murk,
she
could
make
out
the
wizened
features
of
the
Undying
One
to
her
right,
an
old
old
man,
wrinkled
and
hairless.
His
flesh
was
a
ripe
violet-blue,
his
lips
and
nails
bluer
still,
so
dark
they
were
almost
black.
Even
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
blue.
They
stared
unseeing
at
the
ancient
woman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table,
whose
gown
of
pale
silk
had
rotted
on
her
body.
One
withered
breast
was
left
bare
in
the
Qartheen
manner,
to
show
a
pointed
blue
nipple
hard
as
leather.

She
is
not
breathing.
Dany
listened
to
the
silence.
None
of
them
are
breathing,
and
they
do
not
move,
and
those
eyes
see
nothing.
Could
it
be
that
the
Undying
Ones
were
dead?

Her
answer
was
a
whisper
as
thin
as
a
mouseвЂ™s
whiskerвЂ¦
we
liveвЂ¦
liveвЂ¦
liveвЂ¦
it
sounded.
Myriad
other
voices
whispered
echoesвЂ¦
And
knowвЂ¦
knowвЂ¦
knowвЂ¦
knowвЂ¦

вЂњI
have
come
for
the
gift
of
truth,вЂќ
Dany
said.
вЂњIn
the
long
hall,
the
things
I
sawвЂ¦
were
they
true
visions,
or
lies?
Past
things,
or
things
to
come?
What
did
they
mean?вЂќ

вЂ¦the
shape
of
shadowsвЂ¦
morrows
not
yet
madeвЂ¦
drink
from
the
cup
of
iceвЂ¦
drink
from
the
cup
of
fireвЂ¦

вЂ¦mother
of
dragonsвЂ¦
child
of
threeвЂ¦

вЂњThree?вЂќ
She
did
not
understand.

вЂ¦three
heads
has
the
dragonвЂ¦
the
ghost
chorus
yarnmered
inside
her
skull
with
never
a
lip
moving,
never
a
breath
stirring
the
still
blue
airвЂ¦
mother
of
dragonsвЂ¦
child
of
stormвЂ¦
The
whispers
became
a
swirling
songвЂ¦
three
fires
must
you
lightвЂ¦
one
for
life
and
one
for
death
and
one
to
loveвЂ¦
Her
own
heart
was
beating
in
unison
to
the
one
that
floated
before
her,
blue
and
corruptвЂ¦
three
mounts
must
you
rideвЂ¦
one
to
bed
and
one
to
dread
and
one
to
loveвЂ¦
The
voices
were
growing
louder,
she
realized,
and
it
seemed
her
heart
was
slowing,
and
even
her
breathвЂ¦
three
treasons
will
you
knowвЂ¦
once
for
blood
and
once
for
gold
and
once
for
loveвЂ¦

вЂњI
donвЂ™tвЂ¦вЂќ
Her
voice
was
no
more
than
a
whisper,
almost
as
faint
as
theirs.
What
was
happening
to
her?
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
understand,вЂќ
she
said,
more
loudly.
Why
was
it
so
hard
to
talk
here?
вЂњHelp
me.
Show
me.вЂќ

вЂ¦help
herвЂ¦
the
whispers
mockedвЂ¦
show
herвЂ¦

Then
phantoms
shivered
through
the
murk,
images
in
indigo.
Viserys
screamed
as
the
molten
gold
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
filled
his
mouth.
A
tall
lord
with
copper
skin
and
silver-gold
hair
stood
beneath
the
banner
of
a
fiery
stallion,
a
burning
city
behind
him.
Rubies
flew
like
drops
of
blood
from
the
chest
of
a
dying
prince,
and
he
sank
to
his
knees
in
the
water
and
with
his
last
breath
murmured
a
womanвЂ™s
nameвЂ¦
mother
of
dragons,
daughter
of
deathвЂ¦
Glowing
like
sunset,
a
red
sword
was
raised
in
the
hand
of
a
blue-eyed
king
who
cast
no
shadow.
A
cloth
dragon
swayed
on
poles
amidst
a
cheering
crowd.
From
a
smoking
tower,
a
great
stone
beast
took
wing,
breathing
shadow
fireвЂ¦
mother
of
dragons,
slayer
of
liesвЂ¦
Her
silver
was
trotting
through
the
grass,
to
a
darkling
stream
beneath
a
sea
of
stars.
A
corpse
stood
at
the
prow
of
a
ship,
eyes
bright
in
his
dead
face,
grey
lips
smiling
sadly.
A
blue
flower
grew
from
a
chink
in
a
wall
of
ice,
and
filled
the
air
with
sweetnessвЂ¦
mother
of
dragons,
bride
of
fireвЂ¦

Faster
and
faster
the
visions
came,
one
after
the
other,
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
very
air
had
come
alive.
Shadows
whirled
and
danced
inside
a
tent,
boneless
and
terrible.
A
little
girl
ran
barefoot
toward
a
big
house
with
a
red
door.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
shrieked
in
the
flames,
a
dragon
bursting
from
her
brow.
Behind
a
silver
horse
the
bloody
corpse
of
a
naked
man
bounced
and
dragged.
A
white
lion
ran
through
grass
taller
than
a
man.
Beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
a
line
of
naked
crones
crept
from
a
great
lake
and
knelt
shivering
before
her,
their
grey
heads
bowed.
Ten
thousand
slaves
lifted
bloodstained
hands
as
she
raced
by
on
her
silver,
riding
like
the
wind.
вЂњMother!вЂќ
they
cried.
вЂњMother,
mother!вЂќ
They
were
reaching
for
her,
touching
her,
tugging
at
her
cloak,
the
hem
of
her
skirt,
her
foot,
her
leg,
her
breast.
They
wanted
her,
needed
her,
the
fire,
the
life,
and
Dany
gasped
and
opened
her
arms
to
give
herself
to
themвЂ¦

But
then
black
wings
buffeted
her
round
the
head,
and
a
scream
of
fury
cut
the
indigo
air,
and
suddenly
the
visions
were
gone,
ripped
away,
and
DanyвЂ™s
gasp
turned
to
horror.
The
Undying
were
all
around
her,
blue
and
cold,
whispering
as
they
reached
for
her,
pulling,
stroking,
tugging
at
her
clothes,
touching
her
with
their
dry
cold
hands,
twining
their
fingers
through
her
hair.
All
the
strength
had
left
her
limbs.
She
could
not
move.
Even
her
heart
had
ceased
to
beat.
She
felt
a
hand
on
her
bare
breast,
twisting
her
nipple.
Teeth
found
the
soft
skin
of
her
throat.
A
mouth
descended
on
one
eye,
licking,
sucking,
bitingвЂ¦

Then
indigo
turned
to
orange,
and
whispers
turned
to
screams.
Her
heart
was
pounding,
racing,
the
hands
and
mouths
were
gone,
heat
washed
over
her
skin,
and
Dany
blinked
at
a
sudden
glare.
Perched
above
her,
the
dragon
spread
his
wings
and
tore
at
the
terrible
dark
heart,
ripping
the
rotten
flesh
to
ribbons,
and
when
his
head
snapped
forward,
fire
flew
from
his
open
jaws,
bright
and
hot.
She
could
hear
the
shrieks
of
the
Undying
as
they
burned,
their
high
thin
papery
voices
crying
out
in
tongues
long
dead.
Their
flesh
was
crumbling
parchment,
their
bones
dry
wood
soaked
in
tallow.
They
danced
as
the
flames
consumed
them;
they
staggered
and
writhed
and
spun
and
raised
blazing
hands
on
high,
their
fingers
bright
as
torches.

Dany
pushed
herself
to
her
feet
and
bulled
through
them.
They
were
light
as
air,
no
more
than
husks,
and
they
fell
at
a
touch.
The
whole
room
was
ablaze
by
the
time
she
reached
the
door.
вЂњDrogon,вЂќ
she
called,
and
he
flew
to
her
through
the
fire.

Outside
a
long
dim
passageway
stretched
serpentine
before
her,
lit
by
the
flickering
orange
glare
from
behind.
Dany
ran,
searching
for
a
door,
a
door
to
her
right,
a
door
to
her
left,
any
door,
but
there
was
nothing,
only
twisty
stone
walls,
and
a
floor
that
seemed
to
move
slowly
under
her
feet,
writhing
as
if
to
trip
her.
She
kept
her
feet
and
ran
faster,
and
suddenly
the
door
was
there
ahead
of
her,
a
door
like
an
open
mouth.

When
she
spilled
out
into
the
sun,
the
bright
light
made
her
stumble.
Pyat
Pree
was
gibbering
in
some
unknown
tongue
and
hopping
from
one
foot
to
the
other.
When
Dany
looked
behind
her,
she
saw
thin
tendrils
of
smoke
forcing
their
way
through
cracks
in
the
ancient
stone
walls
of
the
Palace
of
Dust,
and
rising
from
between
the
black
tiles
of
the
roof.

Howling
curses,
Pyat
Pree
drew
a
knife
and
danced
toward
her,
but
Drogon
flew
at
his
face.
Then
she
heard
the
crack
of
JhogoвЂ™s
whip,
and
never
was
a
sound
so
sweet.
The
knife
went
flying,
and
an
instant
later
Rakharo
was
slamming
Pyat
to
the
ground.
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
knelt
beside
Dany
in
the
cool
green
grass
and
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulder.





TYRION

вЂњIf
you
die
stupidly,
IвЂ™m
going
to
feed
your
body
to
the
goats,вЂќ
Tyrion
threatened
as
the
first
load
of
Stone
Crows
pushed
off
from
the
quay.

Shagga
laughed.
вЂњThe
Halfman
has
no
goats.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
get
some
just
for
you.вЂќ

Dawn
was
breaking,
and
pale
ripples
of
light
shimmered
on
the
surface
of
the
river,
shattering
under
the
poles
and
reforming
when
the
ferry
had
passed.
Timett
had
taken
his
Burned
Men
into
the
kingswood
two
days
before.
Yesterday
the
Black
Ears
and
Moon
Brothers
followed,
today
the
Stone
Crows.

вЂњWhatever
you
do,
donвЂ™t
try
and
fight
a
battle,вЂќ
Tyrion
said.
вЂњStrike
at
their
camps
and
baggage
train.
Ambush
their
scouts
and
hang
the
bodies
from
trees
ahead
of
their
line
of
march,
loop
around
and
cut
down
stragglers.
I
want
night
attacks,
so
many
and
so
sudden
that
theyвЂ™ll
be
afraid
to
sleepвЂ”вЂќ

Shagga
laid
a
hand
atop
TyrionвЂ™s
head.
вЂњAll
this
I
learned
from
Dolf
son
of
Holger
before
my
beard
had
grown.
This
is
the
way
of
war
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.вЂќ

вЂњThe
kingswood
is
not
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
and
you
wonвЂ™t
be
fighting
Milk
Snakes
and
Painted
Dogs.
And
listen
to
the
guides
IвЂ™m
sending,
they
know
this
wood
as
well
as
you
know
your
mountains.
Heed
their
counsel
and
theyвЂ™ll
serve
you
well.вЂќ

вЂњShagga
will
listen
to
the
HalfmanвЂ™s
pets,вЂќ
the
clansman
promised
solemnly.
And
then
it
was
time
for
him
to
lead
his
garron
onto
the
ferry.
Tyrion
watched
them
push
off
and
pole
out
toward
the
center
of
the
Blackwater.
He
felt
a
queer
twinge
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
as
Shagga
faded
in
the
morning
mist.
He
was
going
to
feel
naked
without
his
clansmen.

He
still
had
BronnвЂ™s
hirelings,
near
eight
hundred
of
them
now,
but
sellswords
were
notoriously
fickle.
Tyrion
had
done
what
he
could
to
buy
their
continued
loyalty,
promising
Bronn
and
a
dozen
of
his
best
men
lands
and
knighthoods
when
the
battle
was
won.
TheyвЂ™d
drunk
his
wine,
laughed
at
his
jests,
and
called
each
other
ser
until
they
were
all
staggeringвЂ¦
all
but
Bronn
himself,
whoвЂ™d
only
smiled
that
insolent
dark
smile
of
his
and
afterward
said,
вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
kill
for
that
knighthood,
but
donвЂ™t
ever
think
theyвЂ™ll
die
for
it.вЂќ

Tyrion
had
no
such
delusion.

The
gold
cloaks
were
almost
as
uncertain
a
weapon.
Six
thousand
men
in
the
City
Watch,
thanks
to
Cersei,
but
only
a
quarter
of
them
could
be
relied
upon.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
few
out-and-out
traitors,
though
thereвЂ™s
some,
even
your
spider
hasnвЂ™t
found
them
all,вЂќ
Bywater
had
warned
him.
вЂњBut
thereвЂ™s
hundreds
greener
than
spring
grass,
men
who
joined
for
bread
and
ale
and
safety.
No
man
likes
to
look
craven
in
the
sight
of
his
fellows,
so
theyвЂ™ll
fight
brave
enough
at
the
start,
when
itвЂ™s
all
warhorns
and
blowing
banners.
But
if
the
battle
looks
to
be
going
sour
theyвЂ™ll
break,
and
theyвЂ™ll
break
bad.
The
first
man
to
throw
down
his
spear
and
run
will
have
a
thousand
more
trodding
on
his
heels.вЂќ

To
be
sure,
there
were
seasoned
men
in
the
City
Watch,
the
core
of
two
thousand
whoвЂ™d
gotten
their
gold
cloaks
from
Robert,
not
Cersei.
Yet
even
thoseвЂ¦
a
watchman
was
not
truly
a
soldier,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
had
been
fond
of
saying.
Of
knights
and
squires
and
men-at-arms,
Tyrion
had
no
more
than
three
hundred.
Soon
enough,
he
must
test
the
truth
of
another
of
his
fatherвЂ™s
sayings:
One
man
on
a
wall
was
worth
ten
beneath
it.

Bronn
and
the
escort
were
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
quay,
amidst
swarming
beggars,
strolling
whores,
and
fishwives
crying
the
catch.
The
fishwives
did
more
business
than
all
the
rest
combined.
Buyers
flocked
around
the
barrels
and
stalls
to
haggle
over
winkles,
clams,
and
river
pike.
With
no
other
food
coming
into
the
city,
the
price
of
fish
was
ten
times
what
it
had
been
before
the
war,
and
still
rising.
Those
who
had
coin
came
to
the
riverfront
each
morning
and
each
evening,
in
hopes
of
bringing
home
an
eel
or
a
pot
of
red
crabs;
those
who
did
not
slipped
between
the
stalls
hoping
to
steal,
or
stood
gaunt
and
forlorn
beneath
the
walls.

The
gold
cloaks
cleared
a
path
through
the
press,
shoving
people
aside
with
the
shafts
of
their
spears.
Tyrion
ignored
the
muttered
curses
as
best
he
could.
A
fish
came
sailing
out
of
the
crowd,
slimy
and
rotten.
It
landed
at
his
feet
and
flew
to
pieces.
He
stepped
over
it
gingerly
and
climbed
into
his
saddle.
Children
with
swollen
bellies
were
already
fighting
over
pieces
of
the
stinking
fish.

Mounted,
he
gazed
along
the
riverfront.
Hammers
rang
in
the
morning
air
as
carpenters
swarmed
over
the
Mud
Gate,
extending
wooden
hoardings
from
the
battlements.
Those
were
coming
well.
He
was
a
deal
less
pleased
by
the
clutter
of
ramshackle
structures
that
had
been
allowed
to
grow
up
behind
the
quays,
attaching
themselves
to
the
city
walls
like
barnacles
on
the
hull
of
a
ship;
bait
shacks
and
pot-shops,
warehouses,
merchantsвЂ™
stalls,
alehouses,
the
cribs
where
the
cheaper
sort
of
whores
spread
their
legs.
It
has
to
go,
every
bit
of
it.
As
it
was,
Stannis
would
hardly
need
scaling
ladders
to
storm
the
walls.

He
called
Bronn
to
his
side.
вЂњAssemble
a
hundred
men
and
burn
everything
you
see
here
between
the
waterвЂ™s
edge
and
the
city
walls.вЂќ
He
waved
his
stubby
fingers,
taking
in
all
the
waterfront
squalor.
вЂњI
want
nothing
left
standing,
do
you
understand?вЂќ

The
black-haired
sellsword
turned
his
head,
considering
the
task.
вЂњThem
as
own
all
this
wonвЂ™t
like
that
much.вЂќ

вЂњI
never
imagined
they
would.
So
be
it;
theyвЂ™ll
have
something
else
to
curse
the
evil
monkey
demon
for.вЂќ

вЂњSome
may
fight.вЂќ

вЂњSee
that
they
lose.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
do
we
do
with
those
that
live
here?вЂќ

вЂњLet
them
have
a
reasonable
time
to
remove
their
property,
and
then
move
them
out.
Try
not
to
kill
any
of
them,
theyвЂ™re
not
the
enemy.
And
no
more
rapes!
Keep
your
men
in
line,
damn
it.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™re
sellswords,
not
septons,вЂќ
said
Bronn.
вЂњNext
youвЂ™ll
be
telling
me
you
want
them
sober.вЂќ

вЂњIt
couldnвЂ™t
hurt.вЂќ

Tyrion
only
wished
he
could
as
easily
make
city
walls
twice
as
tall
and
three
times
as
thick.
Though
perhaps
it
did
not
matter.
Massive
walls
and
tall
towers
had
not
saved
StormвЂ™s
End,
nor
Harrenhal,
nor
even
Winterfell.

He
remembered
Winterfell
as
he
had
last
seen
it.
Not
as
grotesquely
huge
as
Harrenhal,
nor
as
solid
and
impregnable
to
look
at
as
StormвЂ™s
End,
yet
there
had
been
a
great
strength
in
those
stones,
a
sense
that
within
those
walls
a
man
might
feel
safe.
The
news
of
the
castleвЂ™s
fall
had
come
as
a
wrenching
shock.
вЂњThe
gods
give
with
one
hand
and
take
with
the
other,вЂќ
he
muttered
under
his
breath
when
Varys
told
him.
They
had
given
the
Starks
Harrenhal
and
taken
Winterfell,
a
dismal
exchange.

No
doubt
he
should
be
rejoicing.
Robb
Stark
would
have
to
turn
north
now.
If
he
could
not
defend
his
own
home
and
hearth,
he
was
no
sort
of
king
at
all.
It
meant
reprieve
for
the
west,
for
House
Lannister,
and
yetвЂ¦

Tyrion
had
only
the
vaguest
memory
of
Theon
Greyjoy
from
his
time
with
the
Starks.
A
callow
youth,
always
smiling,
skilled
with
a
bow;
it
was
hard
to
imagine
him
as
Lord
of
Winterfell.
The
Lord
of
Winterfell
would
always
be
a
Stark.

He
remembered
their
godswood;
the
tall
sentinels
armored
in
their
grey-green
needles,
the
great
oaks,
the
hawthorn
and
ash
and
soldier
pines,
and
at
the
center
the
heart
tree
standing
like
some
pale
giant
frozen
in
time.
He
could
almost
smell
the
place,
earthy
and
brooding,
the
smell
of
centuries,
and
he
remembered
how
dark
the
wood
had
been
even
by
day.
That
wood
was
Winterfell.
It
was
the
north.
I
never
felt
so
out
of
place
as
I
did
when
I
walked
there,
so
much
an
unwelcome
intruder.
He
wondered
if
the
Greyjoys
would
feel
it
too.
The
castle
might
well
be
theirs,
but
never
that
godswood.
Not
in
a
year,
or
ten,
or
fifty.

Tyrion
Lannister
walked
his
horse
slowly
toward
the
Mud
Gate.
Winterfell
is
nothing
to
you,
he
reminded
himself.
Be
glad
the
place
has
fallen,
and
look
to
your
own
walls.
The
gate
was
open.
Inside,
three
great
trebuchets
stood
side
by
side
in
the
market
square,
peering
over
the
battlements
like
three
huge
birds.
Their
throwing
arms
were
made
from
the
trunks
of
old
oaks,
and
banded
with
iron
to
keep
them
from
splitting.
The
gold
cloaks
had
named
them
the
Three
Whores,
because
theyвЂ™d
be
giving
Lord
Stannis
such
a
lusty
welcome.
Or
so
we
hope.

Tyrion
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
trotted
through
the
Mud
Gate,
breasting
the
human
tide.
Once
beyond
the
Whores,
the
press
grew
thinner
and
the
street
opened
up
around
him.

The
ride
back
to
the
Red
Keep
was
uneventful,
but
at
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
he
found
a
dozen
angry
trader
captains
waiting
in
his
audience
chamber
to
protest
the
seizure
of
their
ships.
He
gave
them
a
sincere
apology
and
promised
compensation
once
the
war
was
done.
That
did
little
to
appease
them.
вЂњWhat
if
you
should
lose,
my
lord?вЂќ
one
Braavosi
asked.

вЂњThen
apply
to
King
Stannis
for
your
compensation.вЂќ

By
the
time
he
rid
himself
of
them,
bells
were
ringing
and
Tyrion
knew
he
would
be
late
for
the
installation.
He
waddled
across
the
yard
almost
at
a
run
and
crowded
into
the
back
of
the
castle
sept
as
Joffrey
fastened
white
silk
cloaks
about
the
shoulders
of
the
two
newest
members
of
his
Kingsguard.
The
rite
seemed
to
require
that
everyone
stand,
so
Tyrion
saw
nothing
but
a
wall
of
courtly
arses.
On
the
other
hand,
once
the
new
High
Septon
was
finished
leading
the
two
knights
through
their
solemn
vows
and
anointing
them
in
the
names
of
the
Seven,
he
would
be
well
positioned
to
be
first
out
the
doors.

He
approved
of
his
sisterвЂ™s
choice
of
Ser
Balon
Swann
to
take
the
place
of
the
slain
Preston
Greenfield.
The
Swanns
were
Marcher
lords,
proud,
powerful,
and
cautious.
Pleading
illness,
Lord
Gulian
Swann
had
remained
in
his
castle,
taking
no
part
in
the
war,
but
his
eldest
son
had
ridden
with
Renly
and
now
Stannis,
while
Balon,
the
younger,
served
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
If
heвЂ™d
had
a
third
son,
Tyrion
suspected
heвЂ™d
be
off
with
Robb
Stark.
It
was
not
perhaps
the
most
honorable
course,
but
it
showed
good
sense;
whoever
won
the
iron
Throne,
the
Swanns
intended
to
survive.
In
addition
to
being
well
born,
young
Ser
Balon
was
valiant,
courtly,
and
skilled
at
arms;
good
with
a
lance,
better
with
a
morningstar,
superb
with
the
bow.
He
would
serve
with
honor
and
courage.

Alas,
Tyrion
could
not
say
the
same
for
CerseiвЂ™s
second
choice.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
looked
formidable
enough.
He
stood
six
feet
and
six
inches,
most
of
it
sinew
and
muscle,
and
his
hook
nose,
bushy
eyebrows,
and
spade-shaped
brown
beard
gave
his
face
a
fierce
aspect,
so
long
as
he
did
not
smile.
Lowborn,
no
more
than
a
hedge
knight,
Kettleblack
was
utterly
dependent
on
Cersei
for
his
advancement,
which
was
doubtless
why
sheвЂ™d
picked
him.
вЂњSer
Osmund
is
as
loyal
as
he
is
brave,вЂќ
sheвЂ™d
told
Joffrey
when
she
put
forward
his
name.
It
was
true,
unfortunately.
The
good
Ser
Osmund
had
been
selling
her
secrets
to
Bronn
since
the
day
sheвЂ™d
hired
him,
but
Tyrion
could
scarcely
tell
her
that.

He
supposed
he
ought
not
complain.
The
appointment
gave
him
another
ear
close
to
the
king,
unbeknownst
to
his
sister.
And
even
if
Ser
Osmund
proved
an
utter
craven,
he
would
be
no
worse
than
Ser
Boros
Blount,
currently
residing
in
a
dungeon
at
Rosby.
Ser
Boros
had
been
escorting
Tommen
and
Lord
Gyles
when
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
and
his
gold
cloaks
had
surprised
them,
and
had
yielded
up
his
charge
with
an
alacrity
that
would
have
enraged
old
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
as
much
as
it
did
Cersei;
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
was
supposed
to
die
in
defense
of
the
king
and
royal
family.
His
sister
had
insisted
that
Joffrey
strip
Blount
of
his
white
cloak
on
the
grounds
of
treason
and
cowardice.
And
now
she
replaces
him
with
another
man
just
as
hollow.

The
praying,
vowing,
and
anointing
seemed
to
take
most
of
the
morning.
TyrionвЂ™s
legs
soon
began
to
ache.
He
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other,
restless.
Lady
Tanda
stood
several
rows
up,
he
saw,
but
her
daughter
was
not
with
her.
He
had
been
half
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
Shae.
Varys
said
she
was
doing
well,
but
he
would
prefer
to
see
for
himself.

вЂњBetter
a
ladyвЂ™s
maid
than
a
pot
girl,вЂќ
Shae
had
said
when
Tyrion
told
her
the
eunuchвЂ™s
scheme.
вЂњCan
I
take
my
belt
of
silver
flowers
and
my
gold
collar
with
the
black
diamonds
you
said
looked
like
my
eyes?
I
wonвЂ™t
wear
them
if
you
say
I
shouldnвЂ™t.вЂќ

Loath
as
he
was
to
disappoint
her,
Tyrion
had
to
point
out
that
while
Lady
Tanda
was
by
no
means
a
clever
woman,
even
she
might
wonder
if
her
daughterвЂ™s
bedmaid
seemed
to
own
more
jewelry
than
her
daughter.
вЂњChoose
two
or
three
dresses,
no
more,вЂќ
he
commanded
her.
вЂњGood
wool,
no
silk,
no
samite,
and
no
fur.
The
rest
IвЂ™ll
keep
in
my
own
chambers
for
when
you
visit
me.вЂќ
It
was
not
the
answer
Shae
had
wanted,
but
at
least
she
was
safe.

When
the
investiture
was
finally
done
Joffrey
marched
out
between
Ser
Balon
and
Ser
Osmund
in
their
new
white
cloaks,
while
Tyrion
lingered
for
a
word
with
the
new
High
Septon
(who
was
his
choice,
and
wise
enough
to
know
who
put
the
honey
on
his
bread).
вЂњI
want
the
gods
on
our
side,вЂќ
Tyrion
told
him
bluntly.
вЂњTell
them
that
Stannis
has
vowed
to
burn
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
true,
my
lord?вЂќ
asked
the
High
Septon,
a
small,
shrewd
man
with
a
wispy
white
beard
and
wizened
face.

Tyrion
shrugged.
вЂњIt
may
be.
Stannis
burned
the
godswood
at
StormвЂ™s
End
as
an
offering
to
the
Lord
of
Light.
If
heвЂ™d
offend
the
old
gods,
why
should
he
spare
the
new?
Tell
them
that.
Tell
them
that
any
man
who
thinks
to
give
aid
to
the
usurper
betrays
the
gods
as
well
as
his
rightful
king.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall,
my
lord.
And
I
shall
command
them
to
pray
for
the
health
of
the
king
and
his
Hand
as
well.вЂќ

Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
was
waiting
on
him
when
Tyrion
returned
to
his
solar,
and
Maester
Frenken
had
brought
messages.
He
let
the
alchemist
wait
a
little
longer
while
he
read
what
the
ravens
had
brought
him.
There
was
an
old
letter
from
Doran
Martell,
warning
him
that
StormвЂ™s
End
had
fallen,
and
a
much
more
intriguing
one
from
Balon
Greyjoy
on
Pyke,
who
styled
himself
King
of
the
Isles
and
the
North.
He
invited
King
Joffrey
to
send
an
envoy
to
the
Iron
Islands
to
fix
the
borders
between
their
realms
and
discuss
a
possible
alliance.

Tyrion
read
the
letter
three
times
and
set
it
aside.
Lord
BalonвЂ™s
longships
would
have
been
a
great
help
against
the
fleet
sailing
up
from
StormвЂ™s
End,
but
they
were
thousands
of
leagues
away
on
the
wrong
side
of
Westeros,
and
Tyrion
was
far
from
certain
that
he
wanted
to
give
away
half
the
realm.
Perhaps
I
should
spill
this
one
in
CerseiвЂ™s
lap,
or
take
it
to
the
council.

Only
then
did
he
admit
Hallyne
with
the
latest
tallies
from
the
alchemists.
вЂњThis
cannot
be
true,вЂќ
said
Tyrion
as
he
pored
over
the
ledgers.
вЂњAlmost
thirteen
thousand
jars?
Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?
IвЂ™m
not
about
to
pay
the
kingвЂ™s
gold
for
empty
jars
and
pots
of
sewage
sealed
with
wax,
I
warn
you.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
no,вЂќ
Hallyne
squeaked,
вЂњthe
sums
are
accurate,
I
swear.
We
have
been,
hmmm,
most
fortunate,
my
lord
Hand.
Another
cache
of
Lord
RossartвЂ™s
was
found,
more
than
three
hundred
jars.
Under
the
Dragonpit!
Some
whores
have
been
using
the
ruins
to
entertain
their
patrons,
and
one
of
them
fell
through
a
patch
of
rotted
floor
into
a
cellar.
When
he
felt
the
jars,
he
mistook
them
for
wine.
He
was
so
drunk
he
broke
the
seal
and
drank
some.вЂќ

вЂњThere
was
a
prince
who
tried
that
once,вЂќ
said
Tyrion
dryly.
вЂњI
havenвЂ™t
seen
any
dragons
rising
over
the
city,
so
it
would
seem
it
didnвЂ™t
work
this
time
either.вЂќ
The
Dragonpit
atop
the
hill
of
Rhaenys
had
been
abandoned
for
a
century
and
a
half.
He
supposed
it
was
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
store
wildfire,
and
better
than
most,
but
it
would
have
been
nice
if
the
late
Lord
Rossart
had
told
someone.
вЂњThree
hundred
jars,
you
say?
That
still
does
not
account
for
these
totals.
You
are
several
thousand
jars
ahead
of
the
best
estimate
you
gave
me
when
last
we
met.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
yes,
thatвЂ™s
so.вЂќ
Hallyne
mopped
at
his
pale
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
his
black-and-scarlet
robe.
вЂњWe
have
been
working
very
hard,
my
lord
Hand,
hmmm.вЂќ

вЂњThat
would
doubtless
explain
why
you
are
making
so
much
more
of
the
substance
than
before.вЂќ
Smiling,
Tyrion
fixed
the
pyromancer
with
his
mismatched
stare.
вЂњThough
it
does
raise
the
question
of
why
you
did
not
begin
working
hard
until
now.вЂќ

Hallyne
had
the
complexion
of
a
mushroom,
so
it
was
hard
to
see
how
he
could
turn
any
paler,
yet
somehow
he
managed.
вЂњWe
were,
my
lord
Hand,
my
brothers
and
I
have
been
laboring
day
and
night
from
the
first,
I
assure
you.
It
is
only,
hmmm,
we
have
made
so
much
of
the
substance
that
we
have
become,
hmmm,
more
practiced
as
it
were,
and
alsoвЂќвЂ”the
alchemist
shifted
uncomfortablyвЂ”вЂњcertain
spells,
hmmm,
ancient
secrets
of
our
order,
very
delicate,
very
troublesome,
but
necessary
if
the
substance
is
to
be,
hmmm,
all
it
should
beвЂ¦вЂќ

Tyrion
was
growing
impatient.
Ser
Jacelyn
Bywater
was
likely
here
by
now,
and
Ironhand
misliked
waiting.
вЂњYes,
you
have
secret
spells;
how
splendid.
What
of
them?вЂќ

вЂњThey,
hmmm,
seem
to
be
working
better
than
they
were.вЂќ
Hallyne
smiled
weakly.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
suppose
there
are
any
dragons
about,
do
you?вЂќ

вЂњNot
unless
you
found
one
under
the
Dragonpit.
Why?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
pardon,
I
was
just
remembering
something
old
Wisdom
Pollitor
told
me
once,
when
I
was
an
acolyte.
IвЂ™d
asked
him
why
so
many
of
our
spells
seemed,
well,
not
as
effectual
as
the
scrolls
would
have
us
believe,
and
he
said
it
was
because
magic
had
begun
to
go
out
of
the
world
the
day
the
last
dragon
died.вЂќ

вЂњSorry
to
disappoint
you,
but
IвЂ™ve
seen
no
dragons.
I
have
noticed
the
KingвЂ™s
Justice
lurking
about,
however.
Should
any
of
these
fruits
youвЂ™re
selling
me
turn
out
to
be
filled
with
anything
but
wildfire,
youвЂ™ll
be
seeing
him
as
well.вЂќ

Hallyne
fled
so
quickly
that
he
almost
bowled
over
Ser
JacelynвЂ”no,
Lord
Jacelyn,
he
must
remember
that.
Ironhand
was
mercifully
direct,
as
ever.
HeвЂ™d
returned
from
Rosby
to
deliver
a
fresh
levy
of
spearmen
recruited
from
Lord
GylesвЂ™s
estates
and
resume
his
command
of
the
City
Watch.
вЂњHow
does
my
nephew
fare?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked
when
they
were
done
discussing
the
cityвЂ™s
defenses.

вЂњPrince
Tommen
is
hale
and
happy,
my
lord.
He
has
adopted
a
fawn
some
of
my
men
brought
home
from
a
hunt.
He
had
one
once
before,
he
says,
but
Joffrey
skinned
her
for
a
jerkin.
He
asks
about
his
mother
sometimes,
and
often
begins
letters
to
the
Princess
Myrcella,
though
he
never
seems
to
finish
any.
His
brother,
however,
he
does
not
seem
to
miss
at
all.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
made
suitable
arrangements
for
him,
should
the
battle
be
lost?вЂќ

вЂњMy
men
have
their
instructions.вЂќ

вЂњWhich
are?вЂќ

вЂњYou
commanded
me
to
tell
no
one,
my
lord.вЂќ

That
made
him
smile.
вЂњIвЂ™m
pleased
you
remember.вЂќ
Should
KingвЂ™s
Landing
fall,
he
might
well
be
taken
alive.
Better
if
he
did
not
know
where
JoffreyвЂ™s
heir
might
be
found.

Varys
appeared
not
long
after
Lord
Jacelyn
had
left.
вЂњMen
are
such
faithless
creatures,вЂќ
he
said
by
way
of
greeting.

Tyrion
sighed.
вЂњWhoвЂ™s
the
traitor
today?вЂќ

The
eunuch
handed
him
a
scroll.
вЂњSo
much
villainy,
it
sings
a
sad
song
for
our
age.
Did
honor
die
with
our
fathers?вЂќ

вЂњMy
father
is
not
dead
yet.вЂќ
Tyrion
scanned
the
list.
вЂњI
know
some
of
these
names.
These
are
rich
men.
Traders,
merchants,
craftsmen.
Why
should
they
conspire
against
us?вЂќ

вЂњIt
seems
they
believe
that
Lord
Stannis
must
win,
and
wish
to
share
his
victory.
They
call
themselves
the
Antler
Men,
after
the
crowned
stag.вЂќ

вЂњSomeone
should
tell
them
that
Stannis
changed
his
sigil.
Then
they
can
be
the
Hot
Hearts.вЂќ
It
was
no
matter
for
jests,
though;
it
appeared
that
these
Antler
Men
had
armed
several
hundred
followers,
to
seize
the
Old
Gate
once
battle
was
joined,
and
admit
the
enemy
to
the
city.
Among
the
names
on
the
list
was
the
master
armorer
Salloreon.
вЂњI
suppose
this
means
I
wonвЂ™t
be
getting
that
terrifying
helm
with
the
demon
horns,вЂќ
Tyrion
complained
as
he
scrawled
the
order
for
the
manвЂ™s
arrest.





THEON

One
moment
he
was
asleep;
the
next,
awake.

Kyra
nestled
against
him,
one
arm
draped
lightly
over
his,
her
breasts
brushing
his
back.
He
could
hear
her
breathing,
soft
and
steady.
The
sheet
was
tangled
about
them.
It
was
the
black
of
night.
The
bedchamber
was
dark
and
still.

What
is
it?
Did
I
hear
something?
Someone?

Wind
sighed
faintly
against
the
shutters.
Somewhere,
far
off,
he
heard
the
yowl
of
a
cat
in
heat.
Nothing
else.
Sleep,
Greyjoy,
he
told
himself.
The
castle
is
quiet,
and
you
have
guards
posted.
At
your
door,
at
the
gates,
on
the
armory.

He
might
have
put
it
down
to
a
bad
dream,
but
he
did
not
remember
dreaming.
Kyra
had
worn
him
out.
Until
Theon
had
sent
for
her,
she
had
lived
all
of
her
eighteen
years
in
the
winter
town
without
ever
setting
foot
inside
the
walls
of
the
castle.
She
came
to
him
wet
and
eager
and
lithe
as
a
weasel,
and
there
had
been
a
certain
undeniable
spice
to
fucking
a
common
tavern
wench
in
Lord
Eddard
StarkвЂ™s
own
bed.

She
murmured
sleepily
as
Theon
slid
out
from
under
her
arm
and
got
to
his
feet.
A
few
embers
still
smoldered
in
the
hearth.
Wex
slept
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
bed,
rolled
up
inside
his
cloak
and
dead
to
the
world.
Nothing
moved.
Theon
crossed
to
the
window
and
threw
open
the
shutters.
Night
touched
him
with
cold
fingers,
and
gooseprickles
rose
on
his
bare
skin.
He
leaned
against
the
stone
sill
and
looked
out
on
dark
towers,
empty
yards,
black
sky,
and
more
stars
than
a
man
could
ever
count
if
he
lived
to
be
a
hundred.
A
half-moon
floated
above
the
Bell
Tower
and
cast
its
reflection
on
the
roof
of
the
glass
gardens.
He
heard
no
alarms,
no
voices,
not
so
much
as
a
footfall.

AllвЂ™s
well,
Greyjoy.
Hear
the
quiet?
You
ought
to
be
drunk
with
joy.
You
took
Winterfell
with
fewer
than
thirty
men,
a
feat
to
sing
of.
Theon
started
back
to
bed.
HeвЂ™d
roll
Kyra
on
her
back
and
fuck
her
again,
that
ought
to
banish
these
phantoms.
Her
gasps
and
giggles
would
make
a
welcome
respite
from
this
silence.

He
stopped.
He
had
grown
so
used
to
the
howling
of
the
direwolves
that
he
scarcely
heard
it
anymoreвЂ¦
but
some
part
of
him,
some
hunterвЂ™s
instinct,
heard
its
absence.

Urzen
stood
outside
his
door,
a
sinewy
man
with
a
round
shield
slung
over
his
back.
вЂњThe
wolves
are
quiet,вЂќ
Theon
told
him.
вЂњGo
see
what
theyвЂ™re
doing,
and
come
straight
back.вЂќ
The
thought
of
the
direwolves
running
loose
gave
him
a
queasy
feeling.
He
remembered
the
day
in
the
wolfswood
when
the
wildlings
had
attacked
Bran.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
had
torn
them
to
pieces.

When
he
prodded
Wex
with
the
toe
of
his
boot,
the
boy
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes.
вЂњMake
certain
Bran
Stark
and
his
little
brother
are
in
their
beds,
and
be
quick
about
it.вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord?вЂќ
Kyra
called
sleepily.

вЂњGo
back
to
sleep,
this
does
not
concern
you.вЂќ
Theon
poured
himself
a
cup
of
wine
and
drank
it
down.
All
the
time
he
was
listening,
hoping
to
hear
a
howl.
Too
few
men,
he
thought
sourly.
I
have
too
few
men.
If
Asha
does
not
comeвЂ¦

Wex
returned
the
quickest,
shaking
his
head
side
to
side.
Cursing,
Theon
found
his
tunic
and
breeches
on
the
floor
where
he
had
dropped
them
in
his
haste
to
get
at
Kyra.
Over
the
tunic
he
donned
a
jerkin
of
iron-studded
leather,
and
he
belted
a
longsword
and
dagger
at
his
waist.
His
hair
was
wild
as
the
wood,
but
he
had
larger
concerns.

By
then
Urzen
was
back.
вЂњThe
wolves
be
gone.вЂќ

Theon
told
himself
he
must
be
as
cold
and
deliberate
as
Lord
Eddard.
вЂњRouse
the
castle,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњHerd
them
out
into
the
yard,
everyone,
weвЂ™ll
see
whoвЂ™s
missing.
And
have
Lorren
make
a
round
of
the
gates.
Wex,
with
me.вЂќ

He
wondered
if
Stygg
had
reached
Deepwood
Motte
yet.
The
man
was
not
as
skilled
a
rider
as
he
claimedвЂ”none
of
the
ironmen
were
much
good
in
the
saddleвЂ”but
thereвЂ™d
been
time
enough.
Asha
might
well
be
on
her
way.
And
if
she
learns
that
I
have
lost
the
StarksвЂ¦
It
did
not
bear
thinking
about.

BranвЂ™s
bedchamber
was
empty,
as
was
RickonвЂ™s
half
a
turn
below.
Theon
cursed
himself.
He
should
have
kept
a
guard
on
them,
but
heвЂ™d
deemed
it
more
important
to
have
men
walking
the
walls
and
protecting
the
gates
than
to
nursemaid
a
couple
of
children,
one
a
cripple.

Outside
he
heard
sobbing
as
the
castle
folk
were
pulled
from
their
beds
and
driven
into
the
yard.
IвЂ™ll
give
them
reason
to
sob.
IвЂ™ve
used
them
gently,
and
this
is
how
they
repay
me.
HeвЂ™d
even
had
two
of
his
own
men
whipped
bloody
for
raping
that
kennel
girl,
to
show
them
he
meant
to
be
just.
They
still
blame
me
for
the
rape,
though.
And
the
rest.
He
deemed
that
unfair.
Mikken
had
killed
himself
with
his
mouth,
just
as
Benfred
had.
As
for
Chayle,
he
had
to
give
someone
to
the
Drowned
God,
his
men
expected
it.
вЂњI
bear
you
no
ill
will,вЂќ
heвЂ™d
told
the
septon
before
they
threw
him
down
the
well,
вЂњbut
you
and
your
gods
have
no
place
here
now.вЂќ
YouвЂ™d
think
the
others
might
be
grateful
he
hadnвЂ™t
chosen
one
of
them,
but
no.
He
wondered
how
many
of
them
were
part
of
this
plot
against
him.

Urzen
returned
with
Black
Lorren.
вЂњThe
HunterвЂ™s
Gate,вЂќ
Lorren
said.
вЂњBest
come
see.вЂќ

The
HunterвЂ™s
Gate
was
conveniently
sited
close
to
the
kennels
and
kitchens.
It
opened
directly
on
fields
and
forests,
allowing
riders
to
come
and
go
without
first
passing
through
the
winter
town,
and
so
was
favored
by
hunting
parties.
вЂњWho
had
the
guard
here?вЂќ
Theon
demanded.

вЂњDrennan
and
Squint.вЂќ

Drennan
was
one
of
the
men
whoвЂ™d
raped
Palla.
вЂњIf
theyвЂ™ve
let
the
boys
escape,
IвЂ™ll
have
more
than
a
little
skin
off
their
back
this
time,
I
swear
it.вЂќ

вЂњNo
need
for
that,вЂќ
Black
Lorren
said
curtly.

Nor
was
there.
They
found
Squint
floating
facedown
in
the
moat,
his
entrails
drifting
behind
him
like
a
nest
of
pale
snakes.
Drennan
lay
half
naked
in
the
gatehouse,
in
the
snug
room
where
the
drawbridge
was
worked.
His
throat
had
been
opened
ear
to
ear.
A
ragged
tunic
concealed
the
half-healed
scars
on
his
back,
but
his
boots
were
scattered
amidst
the
rushes,
and
his
breeches
tangled
about
his
feet.
There
was
cheese
on
a
small
table
near
the
door,
beside
an
empty
flagon.
And
two
cups.

Theon
picked
one
up
and
sniffed
at
the
dregs
of
wine
in
the
bottom.
вЂњSquint
was
up
on
the
wallwalk,
no?вЂќ

вЂњAye,вЂќ
said
Lorren.

Theon
flung
the
cup
into
the
hearth.
вЂњIвЂ™d
say
Drennan
was
pulling
down
his
breeches
to
stick
it
in
the
woman
when
she
stuck
it
in
him.
His
own
cheese
knife,
by
the
look
of
it.
Someone
find
a
pike
and
fish
the
other
fool
out
of
the
moat.вЂќ

The
other
fool
was
in
a
deal
worse
shape
than
Drennan.
When
Black
Lorren
drew
him
out
of
the
water,
they
saw
that
one
of
his
arms
had
been
wrenched
off
at
the
elbow,
half
of
his
neck
was
missing,
and
there
was
a
ragged
hole
where
his
navel
and
groin
once
had
been.
The
pike
tore
through
his
bowels
as
Lorren
was
pulling
him
in.
The
stench
was
awful.

вЂњThe
direwolves,вЂќ
Theon
said.
вЂњBoth
of
them,
at
a
guess.вЂќ
Disgusted,
he
walked
back
to
the
drawbridge.
Winterfell
was
encircled
by
two
massive
granite
walls,
with
a
wide
moat
between
them.
The
outer
wall
stood
eighty
feet
high,
the
inner
more
than
a
hundred.
Lacking
men,
Theon
had
been
forced
to
abandon
the
outer
defenses
and
post
his
guards
along
the
higher
inner
walls.
He
dared
not
risk
having
them
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
moat
should
the
castle
rise
against
him.

There
had
to
be
two
or
more,
he
decided.
While
the
woman
was
entertaining
Drennan,
the
others
freed
the
wolves.

Theon
called
for
a
torch
and
led
them
up
the
steps
to
the
wallwalk.
He
swept
the
flame
low
before
him,
looking
forвЂ¦
there.
On
the
inside
of
the
rampart
and
in
the
wide
crenel
between
two
upthrust
merlons.
вЂњBlood,вЂќ
he
announced,
вЂњclumsily
mopped
up.
At
a
guess,
the
woman
killed
Drennan
and
lowered
the
drawbridge.
Squint
heard
the
clank
of
chains,
came
to
have
a
look,
and
got
this
far.
They
pushed
the
corpse
through
the
crenel
into
the
moat
so
he
wouldnвЂ™t
be
found
by
another
sentry.вЂќ

Urzen
peered
along
the
walls.
вЂњThe
other
watch
turrets
are
not
far.
I
see
torches
burningвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњTorches,
but
no
guards,вЂќ
Theon
said
testily.
вЂњWinterfell
has
more
turrets
than
I
have
men.вЂќ

вЂњFour
guards
at
the
main
gate,вЂќ
said
Black
Lorren,
вЂњand
five
walking
the
walls
beside
Squint.вЂќ

Urzen
said,
вЂњIf
he
had
sounded
his
hornвЂ”вЂќ

I
am
served
by
fools.
вЂњTry
and
imagine
it
was
you
up
here,
Urzen.
ItвЂ™s
dark
and
cold.
You
have
been
walking
sentry
for
hours,
looking
forward
to
the
end
of
your
watch.
Then
you
hear
a
noise
and
move
toward
the
gate,
and
suddenly
you
see
eyes
at
the
top
of
the
stair,
glowing
green
and
gold
in
the
torchlight.
Two
shadows
come
rushing
toward
you
faster
than
you
can
believe.
You
catch
a
glimpse
of
teeth,
start
to
level
your
spear,
and
they
slam
into
you
and
open
your
belly,
tearing
through
leather
as
if
it
were
cheesecloth.вЂќ
He
gave
Urzen
a
hard
shove.
вЂњAnd
now
youвЂ™re
down
on
your
back,
your
guts
are
spilling
out,
and
one
of
them
has
his
teeth
around
your
neck.вЂќ
Theon
grabbed
the
manвЂ™s
scrawny
throat,
tightened
his
fingers,
and
smiled.
вЂњTell
me,
at
what
moment
during
all
of
this
do
you
stop
to
blow
your
fucking
horn?вЂќ
He
shoved
Urzen
away
roughly,
sending
him
stumbling
back
against
a
merlon.
The
man
rubbed
his
throat.
I
should
have
had
those
beasts
put
down
the
day
we
took
the
castle,
he
thought
angrily.
IвЂ™d
seen
them
kill,
I
knew
how
dangerous
they
were.

вЂњWe
must
go
after
them,вЂќ
Black
Lorren
said.

вЂњNot
in
the
dark.вЂќ
Theon
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
chasing
direwolves
through
the
wood
by
night;
the
hunters
could
easily
become
the
hunted.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
wait
for
daylight.
Until
then,
I
had
best
go
speak
with
my
loyal
subjects.вЂќ

Down
in
the
yard,
a
uneasy
crowd
of
men,
women,
and
children
had
been
pushed
up
against
the
wall.
Many
had
not
been
given
time
to
dress;
they
covered
themselves
with
woolen
blankets,
or
huddled
naked
under
cloaks
or
bedrobes.
A
dozen
ironmen
hemmed
them
in,
torches
in
one
hand
and
weapons
in
the
other.
The
wind
was
gusting,
and
the
flickering
orange
light
reflected
dully
off
steel
helms,
thick
beards,
and
unsmiling
eyes.

Theon
walked
up
and
down
before
the
prisoners,
studying
the
faces.
They
all
looked
guilty
to
him.
вЂњHow
many
are
missing?вЂќ

вЂњSix.вЂќ
Reek
stepped
up
behind
him,
smelling
of
soap,
his
long
hair
moving
in
the
wind.
вЂњBoth
Starks,
that
bog
boy
and
his
sister,
the
halfwit
from
the
stables,
and
your
wildling
woman.вЂќ

Osha.
He
had
suspected
her
from
the
moment
he
saw
that
second
cup.
I
should
have
known
better
than
to
trust
that
one.
SheвЂ™s
as
unnatural
as
Asha.
Even
their
names
sound
alike.

вЂњHas
anyone
had
a
look
at
the
stables?вЂќ

вЂњAggar
says
no
horses
are
missing.вЂќ

вЂњDancer
is
still
in
his
stall?вЂќ

вЂњDancer?вЂќ
Reek
frowned.
вЂњAggar
says
the
horses
are
all
there.
Only
the
halfwit
is
missing.вЂќ

TheyвЂ™re
afoot,
then.
That
was
the
best
news
heвЂ™d
heard
since
he
woke.
Bran
would
be
riding
in
his
basket
on
HodorвЂ™s
back,
no
doubt.
Osha
would
need
to
carry
Rickon;
his
little
legs
wouldnвЂ™t
take
him
far
on
their
own.
Theon
was
confident
that
heвЂ™d
soon
have
them
back
in
his
hands.
вЂњBran
and
Rickon
have
fled,вЂќ
he
told
the
castle
folk,
watching
their
eyes.
вЂњWho
knows
where
theyвЂ™ve
gone?вЂќ
No
one
answered.
вЂњThey
could
not
have
escaped
without
help,вЂќ
Theon
went
on.
вЂњWithout
food,
clothing,
weapons.вЂќ
He
had
locked
away
every
sword
and
axe
in
Winterfell,
but
no
doubt
some
had
been
hidden
from
him.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
the
names
of
all
those
who
aided
them.
All
those
who
turned
a
blind
eye.вЂќ
The
only
sound
was
the
wind.
вЂњCome
first
light,
I
mean
to
bring
them
back.вЂќ
He
hooked
his
thumbs
through
his
swordbelt.
вЂњI
need
huntsmen.
Who
wants
a
nice
warm
wolfskin
to
see
them
through
the
winter?
Gage?вЂќ
The
cook
had
always
greeted
him
cheerfully
when
he
returned
from
the
hunt,
to
ask
whether
heвЂ™d
brought
anything
choice
for
the
table,
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
now.
Theon
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come,
searching
their
faces
for
the
least
sign
of
guilty
knowledge.
вЂњThe
wild
is
no
place
for
a
cripple.
And
Rickon,
young
as
he
is,
how
long
will
he
last
out
there?
Nan,
think
how
frightened
he
must
be.вЂќ
The
old
woman
had
nattered
at
him
for
ten
years,
telling
her
endless
stories,
but
now
she
gaped
at
him
as
if
he
were
some
stranger.
вЂњI
might
have
killed
every
man
of
you
and
given
your
women
to
my
soldiers
for
their
pleasure,
but
instead
I
protected
you.
Is
this
the
thanks
you
offer?вЂќ
Joseth
whoвЂ™d
groomed
his
horses,
Farlen
whoвЂ™d
taught
him
all
he
knew
of
hounds,
Barth
the
brewerвЂ™s
wife
whoвЂ™d
been
his
firstвЂ”not
one
of
them
would
meet
his
eyes.
They
hate
me,
he
realized.

Reek
stepped
close.
вЂњStrip
off
their
skins,вЂќ
he
urged,
his
thick
lips
glistening.
вЂњLord
Bolton,
he
used
to
say
a
naked
man
has
few
secrets,
but
a
flayed
manвЂ™s
got
none.вЂќ

The
flayed
man
was
the
sigil
of
House
Bolton,
Theon
knew;
ages
past,
certain
of
their
lords
had
gone
so
far
as
to
cloak
themselves
in
the
skins
of
dead
enemies.
A
number
of
Starks
had
ended
thus.
Supposedly
all
that
had
stopped
a
thousand
years
ago,
when
the
Boltons
had
bent
their
knees
to
Winterfell.
Or
so
they
say,
but
old
ways
die
hard,
as
well
I
know.

вЂњThere
will
be
no
flaying
in
the
north
so
long
as
I
rule
in
Winterfell,вЂќ
Theon
said
loudly.
I
am
your
only
protection
against
the
likes
of
him,
he
wanted
to
scream.
He
could
not
be
that
blatant,
but
perhaps
some
were
clever
enough
to
take
the
lesson.

The
sky
was
greying
over
the
castle
walls.
Dawn
could
not
be
far
off.
вЂњJoseth,
saddle
Smiler
and
a
horse
for
yourself.
Murch,
Gariss,
Poxy
Tym,
youвЂ™ll
come
as
well.вЂќ
Murch
and
Gariss
were
the
best
huntsmen
in
the
castle,
and
Tym
was
a
fine
bowman.
вЂњAggar,
Rednose,
Gelmarr,
Reek,
Wex.вЂќ
He
needed
his
own
to
watch
his
back.
вЂњFarlen,
IвЂ™ll
want
hounds,
and
you
to
handle
them.вЂќ

The
grizzled
kennelmaster
crossed
his
arms.
вЂњAnd
why
would
I
care
to
hunt
down
my
own
trueborn
lords,
and
babes
at
that?вЂќ

Theon
moved
close.
вЂњI
am
your
trueborn
lord
now,
and
the
man
who
keeps
Palla
safe.вЂќ

He
saw
the
defiance
die
in
FarlenвЂ™s
eyes.
вЂњAye,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

Stepping
back,
Theon
glanced
about
to
see
who
else
he
might
add.
вЂњMaester
Luwin,вЂќ
he
announced.

вЂњI
know
nothing
of
hunting.вЂќ

No,
but
I
donвЂ™t
trust
you
in
the
castle
in
my
absence.
вЂњThen
itвЂ™s
past
time
you
learned.вЂќ

вЂњLet
me
come
too.
I
want
that
wolfskin
cloak.вЂќ
A
boy
stepped
forward,
no
older
than
Bran.
It
took
Theon
a
moment
to
remember
him.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
hunted
lots
of
times
before,вЂќ
Walder
Frey
said.
вЂњRed
deer
and
elk,
and
even
boar.вЂќ

His
cousin
laughed
at
him.
вЂњHe
rode
on
a
boar
hunt
with
his
father,
but
they
never
let
him
near
the
boar.вЂќ

Theon
look
at
the
boy
doubtfully.
вЂњCome
if
you
like,
but
if
you
canвЂ™t
keep
up,
donвЂ™t
think
that
IвЂ™ll
nurse
you
along.вЂќ
He
turned
back
to
Black
Lorren.
вЂњWinterfell
is
yours
in
my
absence.
If
we
do
not
return,
do
with
it
as
you
will.вЂќ
That
bloody
well
ought
to
have
them
praying
for
my
success.

They
assembled
by
the
HunterвЂ™s
Gate
as
the
first
pale
rays
of
the
sun
brushed
the
top
of
the
Bell
Tower,
their
breath
frosting
in
the
cold
morning
air.
Gelmarr
had
equipped
himself
with
a
longaxe
whose
reach
would
allow
him
to
strike
before
the
wolves
were
on
him.
The
blade
was
heavy
enough
to
kill
with
a
single
blow.
Aggar
wore
steel
greaves.
Reek
arrived
carrying
a
boar
spear
and
an
overstuffed
washerwomanвЂ™s
sack
bulging
with
god
knows
what.
Theon
had
his
bow;
he
needed
nothing
else.
Once
he
had
saved
BranвЂ™s
life
with
an
arrow.
He
hoped
he
would
not
need
to
take
it
with
another,
but
if
it
came
to
that,
he
would.

Eleven
men,
two
boys,
and
a
dozen
dogs
crossed
the
moat.
Beyond
the
outer
wall,
the
tracks
were
plain
to
read
in
the
soft
ground;
the
pawprints
of
the
wolves,
HodorвЂ™s
heavy
tread,
the
shallower
marks
left
by
the
feet
of
the
two
Reeds.
Once
under
the
trees,
the
stony
ground
and
fallen
leaves
made
the
trail
harder
to
see,
but
by
then
FarlenвЂ™s
red
bitch
had
the
scent.
The
rest
of
the
dogs
were
close
behind,
the
hounds
sniffing
and
barking,
a
pair
of
monstrous
mastiffs
bringing
up
the
rear.
Their
size
and
ferocity
might
make
the
difference
against
a
cornered
direwolf.

HeвЂ™d
have
guessed
that
Osha
might
run
south
to
Ser
Rodrik,
but
the
trail
led
north
by
northwest,
into
the
very
heart
of
the
wolfswood.
Theon
did
not
like
that
one
bit.
It
would
be
a
bitter
irony
if
the
Starks
made
for
Deepwood
Motte
and
delivered
themselves
right
into
AshaвЂ™s
hands.
IвЂ™d
sooner
have
them
dead,
he
thought
bitterly.
It
is
better
to
be
seen
as
cruel
than
foolish.

Wisps
of
pale
mist
threaded
between
the
trees.
Sentinels
and
soldier
pines
grew
thick
about
here,
and
there
was
nothing
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
an
evergreen
forest.
The
ground
was
uneven,
and
the
fallen
needles
disguised
the
softness
of
the
turf
and
made
the
footing
treacherous
for
the
horses,
so
they
had
to
go
slowly.
Not
as
slowly
as
a
man
carrying
a
cripple,
though,
or
a
bony
harridan
with
a
four-year-old
on
her
back.
He
told
himself
to
be
patient.
HeвЂ™d
have
them
before
the
day
was
out.

Maester
Luwin
trotted
up
to
him
as
they
were
following
a
game
trail
along
the
lip
of
a
ravine.
вЂњThus
far
hunting
seems
indistinguishable
from
riding
through
the
woods,
my
lord.вЂќ

Theon
smiled.
вЂњThere
are
similarities.
But
with
hunting,
thereвЂ™s
blood
at
the
end.вЂќ

вЂњMust
it
be
so?
This
flight
was
great
folly,
but
will
you
not
be
merciful?
These
are
your
foster
brothers
we
seek.вЂќ

вЂњNo
Stark
but
Robb
was
ever
brotherly
toward
me,
but
Bran
and
Rickon
have
more
value
to
me
living
than
dead.вЂќ

вЂњThe
same
is
true
of
the
Reeds.
Moat
Cailin
sits
on
the
edge
of
the
bogs.
Lord
Howland
can
make
your
uncleвЂ™s
occupation
a
visit
to
hell
if
he
chooses,
but
so
long
as
you
hold
his
heirs
he
must
stay
his
hand.вЂќ

Theon
had
not
considered
that.
In
truth,
he
had
scarcely
considered
the
mudmen
at
all,
beyond
eyeing
Meera
once
or
twice
and
wondering
if
she
was
still
a
maiden.
вЂњYou
may
be
right.
We
will
spare
them
if
we
can.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
Hodor
too,
I
hope.
The
boy
is
simple,
you
know
that.
He
does
as
he
is
told.
How
many
times
has
he
groomed
your
horse,
soaped
your
saddle,
scoured
your
mail?вЂќ

Hodor
was
nothing
to
him.
вЂњif
he
does
not
fight
us,
we
will
let
him
live.вЂќ
Theon
pointed
a
finger.
вЂњBut
say
one
word
about
sparing
the
wildling,
and
you
can
die
with
her.
She
swore
me
an
oath,
and
pissed
on
it.вЂќ

The
maester
inclined
his
head.
вЂњI
make
no
apologies
for
oathbreakers.
Do
what
you
must.
I
thank
you
for
your
mercy.вЂќ

Mercy,
thought
Theon
as
Luwin
dropped
back.
ThereвЂ™s
a
bloody
trap.
Too
much
and
they
call
you
weak,
too
little
and
youвЂ™re
monstrous.
Yet
the
maester
had
given
him
good
counsel,
he
knew.
His
father
thought
only
in
terms
of
conquest,
but
what
good
was
it
to
take
a
kingdom
if
you
could
not
hold
it?
Force
and
fear
could
carry
you
only
so
far.
A
pity
Ned
Stark
had
taken
his
daughters
south;
elsewise
Theon
could
have
tightened
his
grip
on
Winterfell
by
marrying
one
of
them.
Sansa
was
a
pretty
little
thing
too,
and
by
now
likely
even
ripe
for
bedding.
But
she
was
a
thousand
leagues
away,
in
the
clutches
of
the
Lannisters.
A
shame.

The
wood
grew
ever
wilder.
The
pines
and
sentinels
gave
way
to
huge
dark
oaks.
Tangles
of
hawthorn
concealed
treacherous
gullies
and
cuts.
Stony
hills
rose
and
fell.
They
passed
a
crofterвЂ™s
cottage,
deserted
and
overgown,
and
skirted
a
flooded
quarry
where
the
still
water
had
a
sheen
as
grey
as
steel.
When
the
dogs
began
to
bay,
Theon
figured
the
fugitives
were
near
at
hand.
He
spurred
Smiler
and
followed
at
a
trot,
but
what
he
found
was
only
the
carcass
of
a
young
elkвЂ¦
or
what
remained
of
it.

He
dismounted
for
a
closer
look.
The
kill
was
still
fresh,
and
plainly
the
work
of
wolves.
The
dogs
sniffed
round
it
eagerly,
and
one
of
the
mastiffs
buried
his
teeth
in
a
haunch
until
Farlen
shouted
him
off.
No
part
of
this
animal
has
been
butchered,
Theon
realized.
The
wolves
ate,
but
not
the
men.
Even
if
Osha
did
not
want
to
risk
a
fire,
she
ought
to
have
cut
them
a
few
steaks.
It
made
no
sense
to
leave
so
much
good
meat
to
rot.
вЂњFarlen,
are
you
certain
weвЂ™re
on
the
right
trail?вЂќ
he
demanded.
вЂњCould
your
dogs
be
chasing
the
wrong
wolves?вЂќ

вЂњMy
bitch
knows
the
smell
of
Summer
and
Shaggy
well
enough.вЂќ

вЂњI
hope
so.
For
your
sake.вЂќ

Less
than
an
hour
later,
the
trail
led
down
a
slope
toward
a
muddy
brook
swollen
by
the
recent
rains.
It
was
there
the
dogs
lost
the
scent.
Farlen
and
Wex
waded
across
with
the
hounds
and
came
back
shaking
their
heads
while
the
animals
ranged
up
and
down
the
far
bank,
sniffing.
вЂњThey
went
in
here,
mвЂ™lord,
but
I
canвЂ™t
see
where
they
come
out,вЂќ
the
kennelmaster
said.

Theon
dismounted
and
knelt
beside
the
stream.
He
dipped
a
hand
in
it.
The
water
was
cold.
вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t
have
stayed
long
in
this,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњTake
half
the
dogs
downstream,
IвЂ™ll
go
upвЂ”вЂќ

Wex
clapped
his
hands
together
loudly.

вЂњWhat
is
it?вЂќ
Theon
said.

The
mute
boy
pointed.

The
ground
near
the
water
was
sodden
and
muddy.
The
tracks
the
wolves
had
left
were
plain
enough.
вЂњPawprints,
yes.
So?вЂќ

Wex
drove
his
heel
into
the
mud,
and
pivoted
his
foot
this
way
and
that.
It
left
a
deep
gouge.

Joseth
understood.
вЂњA
man
the
size
of
Hodor
ought
to
have
left
a
deep
print
in
this
mud,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњMore
so
with
the
weight
of
a
boy
on
his
back.
Yet
the
only
boot
prints
here
are
our
own.
See
for
yourself.вЂќ

Appalled,
Theon
saw
it
was
true.
The
wolves
had
gone
into
the
turgid
brown
water
alone.
вЂњOsha
must
have
turned
aside
back
of
us.
Before
the
elk,
most
likely.
She
sent
the
wolves
on
by
themselves,
hoping
weвЂ™d
chase
after
them.вЂќ
He
rounded
on
his
huntsmen.
вЂњIf
you
two
have
played
me
falseвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThereвЂ™s
been
only
the
one
trail,
my
lord,
I
swear
it,вЂќ
said
Gariss
defensively.
вЂњAnd
the
direwolves
would
never
have
parted
from
them
boys.
Not
for
long.вЂќ

ThatвЂ™s
so,
Theon
thought.
Summer
and
Shaggydog
might
have
gone
off
to
hunt,
but
soon
or
late
they
would
return
to
Bran
and
Rickon.
вЂњGariss,
Murch,
take
four
dogs
and
double
back,
find
where
we
lost
them.
Aggar,
you
watch
them,
IвЂ™ll
have
no
trickery.
Farlen
and
I
will
follow
the
direwolves.
Give
a
blast
on
the
horn
when
you
pick
up
the
trail.
Two
blasts
if
you
catch
sight
of
the
beasts
themselves.
Once
we
find
where
they
went,
theyвЂ™ll
lead
us
back
to
their
masters.вЂќ

He
took
Wex,
the
Frey
boy,
and
Gynir
Rednose
to
search
upstream.
He
and
Wex
rode
on
one
side
of
the
brook,
Rednose
and
Walder
Frey
on
the
other,
each
with
a
pair
of
hounds.
The
wolves
might
have
come
out
on
either
bank.
Theon
kept
an
eye
out
for
tracks,
spoor,
broken
branches,
any
hint
as
to
where
the
direwolves
might
have
left
the
water.
He
spied
the
prints
of
deer,
elk,
and
badger
easily
enough.
Wex
surprised
a
vixen
drinking
at
the
stream,
and
Walder
flushed
three
rabbits
from
the
underbrush
and
managed
to
put
an
arrow
in
one.
They
saw
the
claw
marks
where
a
bear
had
shredded
the
bark
of
a
tall
birch.
But
of
the
direwolves
there
was
no
sign.

A
little
farther,
Theon
told
himself.
Past
that
oak,
over
that
rise,
past
the
next
bend
of
the
stream,
weвЂ™ll
find
something
there.
He
pressed
on
long
after
he
knew
he
should
turn
back,
a
growing
sense
of
anxiety
gnawing
at
his
belly.
It
was
midday
when
he
wrenched
SmilerвЂ™s
head
round
in
disgust
and
gave
up.

Somehow
Osha
and
the
wretched
boys
were
eluding
him.
It
should
not
have
been
possible,
not
on
foot,
burdened
with
a
cripple
and
a
young
child.
Every
passing
hour
increased
the
likelihood
that
they
would
make
good
their
escape.
If
they
reach
a
villageвЂ¦
The
people
of
the
north
would
never
deny
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
sons,
RobbвЂ™s
brothers.
TheyвЂ™d
have
mounts
to
speed
them
on
their
way,
food.
Men
would
fight
for
the
honor
of
protecting
them.
The
whole
bloody
north
would
rally
around
them.

The
wolves
went
downstream,
thatвЂ™s
all.
He
clung
to
that
thought.
That
red
bitch
will
sniff
where
they
came
out
of
the
water
and
weвЂ™ll
be
after
them
again.

But
when
they
joined
up
with
FarlenвЂ™s
party,
one
look
at
the
kennelmasterвЂ™s
face
smashed
all
of
TheonвЂ™s
hopes
to
shards.
вЂњThe
only
thing
those
dogs
are
fit
for
is
a
bear
baiting,вЂќ
he
said
angrily.
вЂњWould
that
I
had
a
bear.вЂќ

вЂњThe
dogs
are
not
at
fault.вЂќ
Farlen
knelt
between
a
mastiff
and
his
precious
red
bitch,
a
hand
on
each.
вЂњRunning
water
donвЂ™t
hold
no
scents,
mвЂ™lord.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wolves
had
to
come
out
of
the
stream
somewhere.вЂќ

вЂњNo
doubt
they
did.
Upstream
or
down.
We
keep
on,
weвЂ™ll
find
the
place,
but
which
way?вЂќ

вЂњI
never
knew
a
wolf
to
run
up
a
streambed
for
miles,вЂќ
said
Reek.
вЂњA
man
might.
If
he
knew
he
was
being
hunted,
he
might.
But
a
wolf?вЂќ

Yet
Theon
wondered.
These
beasts
were
not
as
other
wolves.
I
should
have
skinned
the
cursed
things.

It
was
the
same
tale
all
over
again
when
they
rejoined
Gariss,
Murch,
and
Aggar.
The
huntsmen
had
retraced
their
steps
halfway
to
Winterfell
without
finding
any
sign
of
where
the
Starks
might
have
parted
company
with
the
direwolves.
FarlenвЂ™s
hounds
seemed
as
frustrated
as
their
masters,
sniffing
forlornly
at
trees
and
rocks
and
snapping
irritably
at
each
other.

Theon
dared
not
admit
defeat.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
return
to
the
brook.
Search
again.
This
time
weвЂ™ll
go
as
far
as
we
must.вЂќ

вЂњWe
wonвЂ™t
find
them,вЂќ
the
Frey
boy
said
suddenly.
вЂњNot
so
long
as
the
frogeaters
are
with
them.
Mudmen
are
sneaks,
they
wonвЂ™t
fight
like
decent
folks,
they
skulk
and
use
poison
arrows,
You
never
see
them,
but
they
see
you.
Those
who
go
into
the
bogs
after
them
get
lost
and
never
come
out.
Their
houses
move,
even
the
castles
like
Greywater
Watch.вЂќ
He
glanced
nervously
at
greenery
that
encircled
them
on
all
sides.
вЂњThey
might
be
out
there
right
now,
listening
to
everything
we
say.вЂќ

Farlen
laughed
to
show
what
he
thought
of
that
notion.
вЂњMy
dogs
would
smell
anything
in
them
bushes.
Be
all
over
them
before
you
could
break
wind,
boy.вЂќ

вЂњFrogeaters
donвЂ™t
smell
like
men,вЂќ
Frey
insisted.
вЂњThey
have
a
boggy
stink,
like
frogs
and
trees
and
scummy
water.
Moss
grows
under
their
arms
in
place
of
hair,
and
they
can
live
with
nothing
to
eat
but
mud
and
breathe
swamp
water.вЂќ

Theon
was
about
to
tell
him
what
he
ought
to
do
with
his
wet
nurseвЂ™s
fable
when
Maester
Luwin
spoke
up.
вЂњThe
histories
say
the
crannogmen
grew
close
to
the
children
of
the
forest
in
the
days
when
the
greenseers
tried
to
bring
the
hammer
of
the
waters
down
upon
the
Neck.
It
may
be
that
they
have
secret
knowledge.вЂќ

Suddenly
the
wood
seemed
a
deal
darker
than
it
had
a
moment
before,
as
if
a
cloud
had
passed
before
the
sun.
It
was
one
thing
to
have
some
fool
boy
spouting
folly,
but
maesters
were
supposed
to
be
wise.
вЂњThe
only
children
that
concern
me
are
Bran
and
Rickon,вЂќ
Theon
said.
вЂњBack
to
the
stream.
Now.вЂќ

For
a
moment
he
did
not
think
they
were
going
to
obey,
but
in
the
end
old
habit
asserted
itself.
They
followed
sullenly,
but
they
followed.
The
Frey
boy
was
as
jumpy
as
those
rabbits
heвЂ™d
flushed
earlier.
Theon
put
men
on
either
bank
and
followed
the
current.
They
rode
for
miles,
going
slow
and
careful,
dismounting
to
lead
the
horses
over
treacherous
ground,
letting
the
good-for-bear-bait
hounds
sniff
at
every
bush.
Where
a
fallen
tree
dammed
the
flow,
the
hunters
were
forced
to
loop
around
a
deep
green
pool,
but
if
the
direwolves
had
done
the
same
theyвЂ™d
left
neither
print
nor
spoor.
The
beasts
had
taken
to
swimming,
it
seemed.
When
I
catch
them,
theyвЂ™ll
have
all
the
swimming
they
can
stomach.
IвЂ™ll
give
them
both
to
the
Drowned
God.

When
the
woods
began
to
darken,
Theon
Greyjoy
knew
he
was
beaten.
Either
the
crannogmen
did
know
the
magic
of
the
children
of
the
forest,
or
else
Osha
had
deceived
them
with
some
wildling
trick.
He
made
them
press
on
through
the
dusk,
but
when
the
last
light
faded
Joseth
finally
worked
up
the
courage
to
say,
вЂњThis
is
fruitless,
my
lord.
We
will
lame
a
horse,
break
a
leg.вЂќ

вЂњJoseth
has
the
right
of
it,вЂќ
said
Maester
Luwin.
вЂњGroping
through
the
woods
by
torchlight
will
avail
us
nothing.вЂќ

Theon
could
taste
bile
at
the
back
of
his
throat,
and
his
stomach
was
a
nest
of
snakes
twining
and
snapping
at
each
other.
If
he
crept
back
to
Winterfell
empty-handed,
he
might
as
well
dress
in
motley
henceforth
and
wear
a
pointed
hat;
the
whole
north
would
know
him
for
a
fool.
And
when
my
father
hears,
and
AshaвЂ¦

вЂњMвЂ™lord
prince.вЂќ
Reek
urged
his
horse
near.
вЂњMight
be
them
Starks
never
came
this
way.
If
I
was
them,
I
would
have
gone
north
and
east,
maybe.
To
the
Umbers.
Good
Stark
men,
they
are.
But
their
lands
are
a
long
way.
The
boys
will
shelter
someplace
nearer.
Might
be
I
know
where.вЂќ

Theon
looked
at
him
suspiciously.
вЂњTell
me.вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
that
old
mill,
sitting
lonely
on
the
Acorn
Water?
We
stopped
there
when
I
was
being
dragged
to
Winterfell
a
captive.
The
millerвЂ™s
wife
sold
us
hay
for
our
horses
while
that
old
knight
clucked
over
her
brats.
Might
be
the
Starks
are
hiding
there.вЂќ

Theon
knew
the
mill.
He
had
even
tumbled
the
millerвЂ™s
wife
a
time
or
two.
There
was
nothing
special
about
it,
or
her.
вЂњWhy
there?
There
are
a
dozen
villages
and
holdfasts
just
as
close.вЂќ

Amusement
shone
in
those
pale
eyes.
вЂњWhy?
Now
thatвЂ™s
past
knowing.
But
theyвЂ™re
there,
I
have
a
feeling.вЂќ

He
was
growing
sick
of
the
manвЂ™s
sly
answers.
His
lips
look
like
two
worms
fucking.
вЂњWhat
are
you
saying?
If
youвЂ™ve
kept
some
knowledge
from
meвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord
prince?вЂќ
Reek
dismounted,
and
beckoned
Theon
to
do
the
same.
When
they
were
both
afoot,
he
pulled
open
the
cloth
sack
heвЂ™d
fetched
from
Winterfell.
вЂњHave
a
look
here.вЂќ

It
was
growing
hard
to
see.
Theon
thrust
his
hand
into
the
sack
impatiently,
groping
amongst
soft
fur
and
rough
scratchy
wool.
A
sharp
point
pricked
his
skin,
and
his
fingers
closed
around
something
cold
and
hard.
He
drew
out
a
wolfвЂ™s-head
brooch,
silver
and
jet.
Understanding
came
suddenly.
His
hand
closed
into
a
fist.
вЂњGelmarr,вЂќ
he
said,
wondering
whom
he
could
trust.
None
of
them.
вЂњAggar.
Rednose.
With
us.
The
rest
of
you
may
return
to
Winterfell
with
the
hounds.
IвЂ™ll
have
no
further
need
of
them.
I
know
where
Bran
and
Rickon
are
hiding
now.вЂќ

вЂњPrince
Theon,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
entreated,
вЂњyou
will
remember
your
promise?
Mercy,
you
said.вЂќ

вЂњMercy
was
for
this
morning,вЂќ
said
Theon.
It
is
better
to
be
feared
than
laughed
at.
вЂњBefore
they
made
me
angry.вЂќ





JON

They
could
see
the
fire
in
the
night,
glimmering
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
like
a
fallen
star.
It
burned
redder
than
the
other
stars,
and
did
not
twinkle,
though
sometimes
it
flared
up
bright
and
sometimes
dwindled
down
to
no
more
than
a
distant
spark,
dull
and
faint.

Half
a
mile
ahead
and
two
thousand
feet
up,
Jon
judged,
and
perfectly
placed
to
see
anything
moving
in
the
pass
below.

вЂњWatchers
in
the
Skirling
Pass,вЂќ
wondered
the
oldest
among
them.
In
the
spring
of
his
youth,
he
had
been
squire
to
a
king,
so
the
black
brothers
still
called
him
Squire
Dalbridge.
вЂњWhat
is
it
Mance
Rayder
fears,
I
wonder?вЂќ

вЂњIf
he
knew
theyвЂ™d
lit
a
fire,
heвЂ™d
flay
the
poor
bastards,вЂќ
said
Ebben,
a
squat
bald
man
muscled
like
a
bag
of
rocks.

вЂњFire
is
life
up
here,вЂќ
said
Qhorin
Halfhand,
вЂњbut
it
can
be
death
as
well.вЂќ
By
his
command,
theyвЂ™d
risked
no
open
flames
since
entering
the
mountains.
They
ate
cold
salt
beef,
hard
bread,
and
harder
cheese,
and
slept
clothed
and
huddled
beneath
a
pile
of
cloaks
and
furs,
grateful
for
each
otherвЂ™s
warmth.
It
made
Jon
remember
cold
nights
long
ago
at
Winterfell,
when
heвЂ™d
shared
a
bed
with
his
brothers.
These
men
were
brothers
too,
though
the
bed
they
shared
was
stone
and
earth.

вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
have
a
horn,вЂќ
said
Stonesnake.

The
Halfhand
said,
вЂњA
horn
they
must
not
blow.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
a
long
cruel
climb
by
night,вЂќ
Ebben
said
as
he
eyed
the
distant
spark
through
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
that
sheltered
them.
The
sky
was
cloudless,
the
jagged
mountains
rising
black
on
black
until
the
very
top,
where
their
cold
crowns
of
snow
and
ice
shone
palely
in
the
moonlight.

вЂњAnd
a
longer
fall,вЂќ
said
Qhorin
Halfhand.
вЂњTwo
men,
I
think.
There
are
like
to
be
two
up
there,
sharing
the
watch.вЂќ

вЂњMe.вЂќ
The
ranger
they
called
Stonesnake
had
already
shown
that
he
was
the
best
climber
among
them.
It
would
have
to
be
him.

вЂњAnd
me,вЂќ
said
Jon
Snow.

Qhorin
Halfhand
looked
at
him.
Jon
could
hear
the
wind
keening
as
it
shivered
through
the
high
pass
above
them.
One
of
the
garrons
whickered
and
pawed
at
the
thin
stony
soil
of
the
hollow
where
they
had
taken
shelter.
вЂњThe
wolf
will
remain
with
us,вЂќ
Qhorin
said.
вЂњWhite
fur
is
seen
too
easily
by
moonlight.вЂќ
He
turned
to
Stonesnake.
вЂњWhen
itвЂ™s
done,
throw
down
a
burning
brand.
WeвЂ™ll
come
when
we
see
it
fall.вЂќ

вЂњNo
better
time
to
start
than
now,вЂќ
said
Stonesnake.

They
each
took
a
long
coil
of
rope.
Stonesnake
carried
a
bag
of
iron
spikes
as
well,
and
a
small
hammer
with
its
head
wrapped
in
thick
felt.
Their
garrons
they
left
behind,
along
with
their
helms,
mail,
and
Ghost.
Jon
knelt
and
let
the
direwolf
nuzzle
him
before
they
set
off.
вЂњStay,вЂќ
he
commanded.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
back
for
you.вЂќ

Stonesnake
took
the
lead.
He
was
a
short
wiry
man,
near
fifty
and
grey
of
beard
but
stronger
than
he
seemed,
and
he
had
the
best
night
eyes
of
anyone
Jon
had
ever
known.
He
needed
them
tonight.
By
day
the
mountains
were
blue-grey,
brushed
with
frost,
but
once
the
sun
vanished
behind
the
jagged
peaks
they
turned
black.
Now
the
rising
moon
had
linmed
them
in
white
and
silver.

The
black
brothers
moved
through
black
shadows
amidst
black
rocks,
working
their
way
up
a
steep,
twisting
trail
as
their
breath
frosted
in
the
black
air.
Jon
felt
almost
naked
without
his
mail,
but
he
did
not
miss
its
weight.
This
was
hard
going,
and
slow.
To
hurry
here
was
to
risk
a
broken
ankle
or
worse.
Stonesnake
seemed
to
know
where
to
put
his
feet
as
if
by
instinct,
but
Jon
needed
to
be
more
careful
on
the
broken,
uneven
ground.

The
Skirling
Pass
was
really
a
series
of
passes,
a
long
twisting
course
that
went
up
around
a
succession
of
icy
wind-carved
peaks
and
down
through
hidden
valleys
that
seldom
saw
the
sun.
Apart
from
his
companions,
Jon
had
glimpsed
no
living
man
since
theyвЂ™d
left
the
wood
behind
and
begun
to
make
their
way
upward.
The
Frostfangs
were
as
cruel
as
any
place
the
gods
had
made,
and
as
inimical
to
men.
The
wind
cut
like
a
knife
up
here,
and
shrilled
in
the
night
like
a
mother
mourning
her
slain
children.
What
few
trees
they
saw
were
stunted,
grotesque
things
growing
sideways
out
of
cracks
and
fissures.
Tumbled
shelves
of
rock
often
overhung
the
trail,
fringed
with
hanging
icicles
that
looked
like
long
white
teeth
from
a
distance.

Yet
even
so,
Jon
Snow
was
not
sorry
he
had
come.
There
were
wonders
here
as
well.
He
had
seen
sunlight
flashing
on
icy
thin
waterfalls
as
they
plunged
over
the
lips
of
sheer
stone
cliffs,
and
a
mountain
meadow
full
of
autumn
wildflowers,
blue
coldsnaps
and
bright
scarlet
frostfires
and
stands
of
piperвЂ™s
grass
in
russet
and
gold.
He
had
peered
down
ravines
so
deep
and
black
they
seemed
certain
to
end
in
some
hell,
and
he
had
ridden
his
garron
over
a
wind-eaten
bridge
of
natural
stone
with
nothing
but
sky
to
either
side.
Eagles
nested
in
the
heights
and
came
down
to
hunt
the
valleys,
circling
effortlessly
on
great
blue-grey
wings
that
seemed
almost
part
of
the
sky.
Once
he
had
watched
a
shadowcat
stalk
a
ram,
flowing
down
the
mountainside
like
liquid
smoke
until
it
was
ready
to
pounce.

Now
it
is
our
turn
to
pounce.
He
wished
he
could
move
as
sure
and
silent
as
that
shadowcat,
and
kill
as
quickly.
Longclaw
was
sheathed
across
his
back,
but
he
might
not
have
room
to
use
it.
He
carried
dirk
and
dagger
for
closer
work.
They
will
have
weapons
as
well,
and
I
am
not
armored.
He
wondered
who
would
prove
the
shadowcat
by
nightвЂ™s
end,
and
who
the
ram.

For
a
long
way
they
stayed
to
the
trail,
following
its
twists
and
turns
as
it
snaked
along
the
side
of
the
mountain,
upward,
ever
upward.
Sometimes
the
mountain
folded
back
on
itself
and
they
lost
sight
of
the
fire,
but
soon
or
late
it
would
always
reappear.
The
path
Stonesnake
chose
would
never
have
served
for
the
horses.
In
places
Jon
had
to
put
his
back
to
the
cold
stone
and
shuffle
along
sideways
like
a
crab,
inch
by
inch.
Even
where
the
track
widened
it
was
treacherous;
there
were
cracks
big
enough
to
swallow
a
manвЂ™s
leg,
rubble
to
stumble
over,
hollow
places
where
the
water
pooled
by
day
and
froze
hard
by
night.
One
step
and
then
another,
Jon
told
himself.
One
step
and
then
another,
and
I
will
not
fall.

He
had
not
shaved
since
leaving
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men,
and
the
hair
on
his
lip
was
soon
stiff
with
frost.
Two
hours
into
the
climb,
the
wind
kicked
up
so
fiercely
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hunch
down
and
cling
to
the
rock,
praying
he
would
not
be
blown
off
the
mountain.
One
step
and
then
another,
he
resumed
when
the
gale
subsided.
One
step
and
then
another,
and
I
will
not
fall.

Soon
they
were
high
enough
so
that
looking
down
was
best
not
considered.
There
was
nothing
below
but
yawning
blackness,
nothing
above
but
moon
and
stars.
вЂњThe
mountain
is
your
mother,вЂќ
Stonesnake
had
told
him
during
an
easier
climb
a
few
days
past.
вЂњCling
to
her,
press
your
face
up
against
her
teats,
and
she
wonвЂ™t
drop
you.вЂќ
Jon
had
made
a
joke
of
it,
saying
how
heвЂ™d
always
wondered
who
his
mother
was,
but
never
thought
to
find
her
in
the
Frostfangs.
It
did
not
seem
nearly
so
amusing
now.
One
step
and
then
another,
he
thought,
clinging
tight.

The
narrow
track
ended
abruptly
where
a
massive
shoulder
of
black
granite
thrust
out
from
the
side
of
the
mountain.
After
the
bright
moonlight,
its
shadow
was
so
black
that
it
felt
like
stepping
into
a
cave.
вЂњStraight
up
here,вЂќ
the
ranger
said
in
a
quiet
voice.
вЂњWe
want
to
get
above
them.вЂќ
He
peeled
off
his
gloves,
tucked
them
through
his
belt,
tied
one
end
of
his
rope
around
his
waist,
the
other
end
around
Jon.
вЂњFollow
me
when
the
rope
grows
taut.вЂќ
The
ranger
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
started
at
once,
moving
upward
with
fingers
and
feet,
faster
than
Jon
would
have
believed.
The
long
rope
unwound
slowly.
Jon
watched
him
closely,
making
note
of
how
he
went,
and
where
he
found
each
handhold,
and
when
the
last
loop
of
hemp
uncoiled,
he
took
off
his
own
gloves
and
followed,
much
more
slowly.

Stonesnake
had
passed
the
rope
around
the
smooth
spike
of
rock
he
was
waiting
on,
but
as
soon
as
Jon
reached
him
he
shook
it
loose
and
was
off
again.
This
time
there
was
no
convenient
cleft
when
he
reached
the
end
of
their
tether,
so
he
took
out
his
felt-headed
hammer
and
drove
a
spike
deep
into
a
crack
in
the
stone
with
a
series
of
gentle
taps.
Soft
as
the
sounds
were,
they
echoed
off
the
stone
so
loudly
that
Jon
winced
with
every
blow,
certain
that
the
wildlings
must
hear
them
too.
When
the
spike
was
secure,
Stonesnake
secured
the
rope
to
it,
and
Jon
started
after
him.
Suck
on
the
mountainвЂ™s
teat,
he
reminded
himself.
DonвЂ™t
look
down.
Keep
your
weight
above
your
feet.
DonвЂ™t
look
down.
Look
at
the
rock
in
front
of
you.
ThereвЂ™s
a
good
handhold,
yes.
DonвЂ™t
look
down.
I
can
catch
a
breath
on
that
ledge
there,
all
I
need
to
do
is
reach
it.
Never
look
down.

Once
his
foot
slipped
as
he
put
his
weight
on
it
and
his
heart
stopped
in
his
chest,
but
the
gods
were
good
and
he
did
not
fall.
He
could
feel
the
cold
seeping
off
the
rock
into
his
fingers,
but
he
dared
not
don
his
gloves;
gloves
would
slip,
no
matter
how
tight
they
seemed,
cloth
and
fur
moving
between
skin
and
stone,
and
up
here
that
could
kill
him.
His
burned
hand
was
stiffening
up
on
him,
and
soon
it
began
to
ache.
Then
he
ripped
open
his
thumbnail
somehow,
and
after
that
he
left
smears
of
blood
wherever
he
put
his
hand.
He
hoped
he
still
had
all
his
fingers
by
the
end
of
the
climb.

Up
they
went,
and
up,
and
up,
black
shadows
creeping
across
the
moonlit
wall
of
rock.
Anyone
down
on
the
floor
of
the
pass
could
have
seen
them
easily,
but
the
mountain
hid
them
from
the
view
of
the
wildlings
by
their
fire.
They
were
close
now,
though.
Jon
could
sense
it.
Even
so,
he
did
not
think
of
the
foes
who
were
waiting
for
him,
all
unknowing,
but
of
his
brother
at
Winterfell.
Bran
used
to
love
to
climb.
I
wish
I
had
a
tenth
part
of
his
courage.

The
wall
was
broken
two-thirds
of
the
way
up
by
a
crooked
fissure
of
icy
stone.
Stonesnake
reached
down
a
hand
to
help
him
up.
He
had
donned
his
gloves
again,
so
Jon
did
the
same.
The
ranger
moved
his
head
to
the
left,
and
the
two
of
them
crawled
along
the
shelf
three
hundred
yards
or
more,
until
they
could
see
the
dull
orange
glow
beyond
the
lip
of
the
cliff.

The
wildlings
had
built
their
watchfire
in
a
shallow
depression
above
the
narrowest
part
of
the
pass,
with
a
sheer
drop
below
and
rock
behind
to
shelter
them
from
the
worst
of
the
wind.
That
same
windbreak
allowed
the
black
brothers
to
crawl
within
a
few
feet
of
them,
creeping
along
on
their
bellies
until
they
were
looking
down
on
the
men
they
must
kill.

One
was
asleep,
curled
up
tight
and
buried
beneath
a
great
mound
of
skins.
Jon
could
see
nothing
of
him
but
his
hair,
bright
red
in
the
firelight.
The
second
sat
close
to
the
flames,
feeding
them
twigs
and
branches
and
complaining
of
the
wind
in
a
querulous
tone.
The
third
watched
the
pass,
though
there
was
little
to
see,
only
a
vast
bowl
of
darkness
ringed
by
the
snowy
shoulders
of
the
mountains.
It
was
the
watcher
who
wore
the
horn.

Three.
For
a
moment
Jon
was
uncertain.
There
was
only
supposed
to
be
two.
One
was
asleep,
though.
And
whether
there
was
two
or
three
or
twenty,
he
still
must
do
what
he
had
come
to
do.
Stonesnake
touched
his
arm,
pointed
at
the
wildling
with
the
horn.
Jon
nodded
toward
the
one
by
the
fire.
It
felt
queer,
picking
a
man
to
kill.
Half
the
days
of
his
life
had
been
spent
with
sword
and
shield,
training
for
this
moment.
Did
Robb
feel
this
way
before
his
first
battle?
he
wondered,
but
there
was
no
time
to
ponder
the
question.
Stonesnake
moved
as
fast
as
his
namesake,
leaping
down
on
the
wildlings
in
a
rain
of
pebbles.
Jon
slid
Longclaw
from
its
sheath
and
followed.

It
all
seemed
to
happen
in
a
heartbeat.
Afterward
Jon
could
admire
the
courage
of
the
wildling
who
reached
first
for
his
horn
instead
of
his
blade.
He
got
it
to
his
lips,
but
before
he
could
sound
it
Stonesnake
knocked
the
horn
aside
with
a
swipe
of
his
shortsword.
JonвЂ™s
man
leapt
to
his
feet,
thrusting
at
his
face
with
a
burning
brand.
He
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
flames
as
he
flinched
back.
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
he
saw
the
sleeper
stirring,
and
knew
he
must
finish
his
man
quick.
When
the
brand
swung
again,
he
bulled
into
it,
swinging
the
bastard
sword
with
both
hands.
The
Valyrian
steel
sheared
through
leather,
fur,
wool,
and
flesh,
but
when
the
wildling
fell
he
twisted,
ripping
the
sword
from
JonвЂ™s
grasp.
On
the
ground
the
sleeper
sat
up
beneath
his
furs.
Jon
slid
his
dirk
free,
grabbing
the
man
by
the
hair
and
jamming
the
point
of
the
knife
up
under
his
chin
as
he
reached
for
hisвЂ”no,
herвЂ”

His
hand
froze.
вЂњA
girl.вЂќ

вЂњA
watcher,вЂќ
said
Stonesnake.
вЂњA
wildling.
Finish
her.вЂќ

Jon
could
see
fear
and
fire
in
her
eyes.
Blood
ran
down
her
white
throat
from
where
the
point
of
his
dirk
had
pricked
her.
One
thrust
and
itвЂ™s
done,
he
told
himself.
He
was
so
close
he
could
smell
onion
on
her
breath.
She
is
no
older
than
I
am.
Something
about
her
made
him
think
of
Arya,
though
they
looked
nothing
at
all
alike.
вЂњWill
you
yield?вЂќ
he
asked,
giving
the
dirk
a
half
turn.
And
if
she
doesnвЂ™t?

вЂњI
yield.вЂќ
Her
words
steamed
in
the
cold
air.

вЂњYouвЂ™re
our
captive,
then.вЂќ
He
pulled
the
dirk
away
from
the
soft
skin
of
her
throat.

вЂњQhorin
said
nothing
of
taking
captives,вЂќ
said
Stonesnake.

вЂњHe
never
said
not
to.вЂќ
Jon
let
go
his
grip
on
the
girlвЂ™s
hair,
and
she
scuttled
backward,
away
from
them.

вЂњSheвЂ™s
a
spearwife.вЂќ
Stonesnake
gestured
at
the
long-hafted
axe
that
lay
beside
her
sleeping
furs.
вЂњShe
was
reaching
for
that
when
you
grabbed
her.
Give
her
half
a
chance
and
sheвЂ™ll
bury
it
between
your
eyes.вЂќ

вЂњI
wonвЂ™t
give
her
half
a
chance.вЂќ
Jon
kicked
the
axe
well
out
of
the
girlвЂ™s
reach.
вЂњDo
you
have
a
name?вЂќ

вЂњYgritte.вЂќ
Her
hand
rubbed
at
her
throat
and
came
away
bloody.
She
stared
at
the
wetness.

Sheathing
his
dirk,
he
wrenched
Longclaw
free
from
the
body
of
the
man
heвЂ™d
killed.
вЂњYou
are
my
captive,
Ygritte.вЂќ

вЂњI
gave
you
my
name.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
Jon
Snow.вЂќ

She
flinched.
вЂњAn
evil
name.вЂќ

вЂњA
bastard
name,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњMy
father
was
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell.вЂќ

The
girl
watched
him
warily,
but
Stonesnake
gave
a
mordant
chuckle.
вЂњItвЂ™s
the
captive
supposed
to
tell
things,
remember?вЂќ
The
ranger
thrust
a
long
branch
into
the
fire.
вЂњNot
that
she
will.
IвЂ™ve
known
wildlings
to
bite
off
their
own
tongues
before
theyвЂ™d
answer
a
question.вЂќ
When
the
end
of
the
branch
was
blazing
merrily,
he
took
two
steps
and
flung
it
out
over
the
pass.
It
fell
through
the
night
spinning
until
it
was
lost
to
sight.

вЂњYou
ought
to
burn
them
you
killed,вЂќ
said
Ygritte.

вЂњNeed
a
bigger
fire
for
that,
and
big
fires
burn
bright.вЂќ
Stonesnake
turned,
his
eyes
scanning
the
black
distance
for
any
spark
of
light.
вЂњAre
there
more
wildlings
close
by,
is
that
it?вЂќ

вЂњBurn
them,вЂќ
the
girl
repeated
stubbornly,
вЂњor
it
might
be
youвЂ™ll
need
them
swords
again.вЂќ

Jon
remembered
dead
Othor
and
his
cold
black
hands.
вЂњMaybe
we
should
do
as
she
says.вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
other
ways.вЂќ
Stonesnake
knelt
beside
the
man
heвЂ™d
slain,
stripped
him
of
cloak
and
boots
and
belt
and
vest,
then
hoisted
the
body
over
one
thin
shoulder
and
carried
it
to
the
edge.
He
grunted
as
he
tossed
it
over.
A
moment
later
they
heard
a
wet,
heavy
smack
well
below
them.
By
then
the
ranger
had
the
second
body
down
to
the
skin
and
was
dragging
it
by
the
arms.
Jon
took
the
feet
and
together
they
flung
the
dead
man
out
in
the
blackness
of
the
night.

Ygritte
watched
and
said
nothing.
She
was
older
than
heвЂ™d
thought
at
first,
Jon
realized;
maybe
as
old
as
twenty,
but
short
for
her
age,
bandy-legged,
with
a
round
face,
small
hands,
and
a
pug
nose.
Her
shaggy
mop
of
red
hair
stuck
out
in
all
directions.
She
looked
plump
as
she
crouched
there,
but
most
of
that
was
layers
of
fur
and
wool
and
leather.
Underneath
all
that
she
could
be
as
skinny
as
Arya.

вЂњWere
you
sent
to
watch
for
us?вЂќ
Jon
asked
her.

вЂњYou,
and
others.вЂќ

Stonesnake
warmed
his
hands
over
the
fire.
вЂњWhat
waits
beyond
the
pass?вЂќ

вЂњThe
free
folk.вЂќ

вЂњHow
many?вЂќ

вЂњHundreds
and
thousands.
More
than
you
ever
saw,
crow.вЂќ
She
smiled.
Her
teeth
were
crooked,
but
very
white.

She
doesnвЂ™t
know
how
many.
вЂњWhy
come
here?вЂќ

Ygritte
fell
silent.

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
in
the
Frostfangs
that
your
king
could
want?
You
canвЂ™t
stay
here,
thereвЂ™s
no
food.вЂќ

She
turned
her
face
away
from
him.

вЂњDo
you
mean
to
march
on
the
Wall?
When?вЂќ

She
stared
at
the
flames
as
if
she
could
not
hear
him.

вЂњDo
you
know
anything
of
my
uncle,
Benjen
Stark?вЂќ

Ygritte
ignored
him.
Stonesnake
laughed.
вЂњif
she
spits
out
her
tongue,
donвЂ™t
say
I
didnвЂ™t
warn
you.вЂќ

A
low
rumbling
growl
echoed
off
the
rock.
Shadowcat,
Jon
knew
at
once.
As
he
rose
he
heard
another,
closer
at
hand.
He
pulled
his
sword
and
turned,
listening.

вЂњThey
wonвЂ™t
trouble
us,вЂќ
Ygritte
said.
вЂњItвЂ™s
the
dead
theyвЂ™ve
come
for.
Cats
can
smell
blood
six
miles
off.
TheyвЂ™ll
stay
near
the
bodies
till
theyвЂ™ve
eaten
every
last
stringy
shred
oвЂ™
meat,
and
cracked
the
bones
for
the
marrow.вЂќ

Jon
could
hear
the
sounds
of
their
feeding
echoing
off
the
rocks.
It
gave
him
an
uneasy
feeling.
The
warmth
of
the
fire
made
him
realize
how
bone-tired
he
was,
but
he
dared
not
sleep.
He
had
taken
a
captive,
and
it
was
on
him
to
guard
her.
вЂњWere
they
your
kin?вЂќ
he
asked
her
quietly.
вЂњThe
two
we
killed?вЂќ

вЂњNo
more
than
you
are.вЂќ

вЂњMe?вЂќ
He
frowned.
вЂњWhat
do
you
mean?вЂќ

вЂњYou
said
you
were
the
Bastard
oвЂ™
Winterfell.вЂќ

вЂњI
am.вЂќ

вЂњWho
was
your
mother?вЂќ

вЂњSome
woman.
Most
of
them
are.вЂќ
Someone
had
said
that
to
him
once.
He
did
not
remember
who.

She
smiled
again,
a
flash
of
white
teeth.
вЂњAnd
she
never
sung
you
the
song
oвЂ™
the
winter
rose?вЂќ

вЂњI
never
knew
my
mother.
Or
any
such
song.вЂќ

вЂњBael
the
Bard
made
it,вЂќ
said
Ygritte.
вЂњHe
was
King-beyond-the-Wall
a
long
time
back.
All
the
free
folk
know
his
songs,
but
might
be
you
donвЂ™t
sing
them
in
the
south.вЂќ

вЂњWinterfellвЂ™s
not
in
the
south,вЂќ
Jon
objected.

вЂњYes
it
is.
Everything
below
the
WallвЂ™s
south
to
us.вЂќ

He
had
never
thought
of
it
that
way.
вЂњI
suppose
itвЂ™s
all
in
where
youвЂ™re
standing.вЂќ

вЂњAye,вЂќ
Ygritte
agreed.
вЂњIt
always
is.вЂќ

вЂњTell
me,вЂќ
Jon
urged
her.
It
would
be
hours
before
Qhorin
came
up,
and
a
story
would
help
keep
him
awake.
вЂњI
want
to
hear
this
tale
of
yours.вЂќ

вЂњMight
be
you
wonвЂ™t
like
it
much.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
hear
it
all
the
same.вЂќ

вЂњBrave
black
crow,вЂќ
she
mocked.
вЂњWell,
long
before
he
was
king
over
the
free
folk,
Bael
was
a
great
raider.вЂќ

Stonesnake
gave
a
snort.
вЂњA
murderer,
robber,
and
raper,
is
what
you
mean.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
all
in
where
youвЂ™re
standing
too,вЂќ
Ygritte
said.
вЂњThe
Stark
in
Winterfell
wanted
BaelвЂ™s
head,
but
never
could
take
him,
and
the
taste
oвЂ™
failure
galled
him.
One
day
in
his
bitterness
he
called
Bael
a
craven
who
preyed
only
on
the
weak.
When
word
oвЂ™
that
got
back,
Bael
vowed
to
teach
the
lord
a
lesson.
So
he
scaled
the
Wall,
skipped
down
the
kingsroad,
and
walked
into
Winterfell
one
winterвЂ™s
night
with
harp
in
hand,
naming
himself
Sygerrik
of
Skagos.
Sygerrik
means
вЂdeceiverвЂ™
in
the
Old
Tongue,
that
the
First
Men
spoke,
and
the
giants
still
speak.

вЂњNorth
or
south,
singers
always
find
a
ready
welcome,
so
Bael
ate
at
Lord
StarkвЂ™s
own
table,
and
played
for
the
lord
in
his
high
seat
until
half
the
night
was
gone.
The
old
songs
he
played,
and
new
ones
heвЂ™d
made
himself,
and
he
played
and
sang
so
well
that
when
he
was
done,
the
lord
offered
to
let
him
name
his
own
reward.
вЂAll
I
ask
is
a
flower,вЂ™
Bael
answered,
вЂthe
fairest
flower
that
blooms
in
the
gardens
oвЂ™
Winterfell.вЂ™

вЂњNow
as
it
happened
the
winter
roses
had
only
then
come
into
bloom,
and
no
flower
is
so
rare
nor
precious.
So
the
Stark
sent
to
his
glass
gardens
and
commanded
that
the
most
beautiful
oвЂ™
the
winter
roses
be
plucked
for
the
singerвЂ™s
payment.
And
so
it
was
done.
But
when
morning
come,
the
singer
had
vanishedвЂ¦
and
so
had
Lord
BrandonвЂ™s
maiden
daughter.
Her
bed
they
found
empty,
but
for
the
pale
blue
rose
that
Bael
had
left
on
the
pillow
where
her
head
had
lain.вЂќ

Jon
had
never
heard
this
tale
before.
вЂњWhich
Brandon
was
this
supposed
to
be?
Brandon
the
Builder
lived
in
the
Age
of
Heroes,
thousands
of
years
before
Bael.
There
was
Brandon
the
Burner
and
his
father
Brandon
the
Shipwright,
butвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThis
was
Brandon
the
Daughterless,вЂќ
Ygritte
said
sharply.
вЂњWould
you
hear
the
tale,
or
no?вЂќ

He
scowled.
вЂњGo
on.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Brandon
had
no
other
children.
At
his
behest,
the
black
crows
flew
forth
from
their
castles
in
the
hundreds,
but
nowhere
could
they
find
any
sign
oвЂ™
Bael
or
this
maid.
For
most
a
year
they
searched,
till
the
lord
lost
heart
and
took
to
his
bed,
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
line
oвЂ™
Starks
was
at
its
end.
But
one
night
as
he
lay
waiting
to
die,
Lord
Brandon
heard
a
childвЂ™s
cry.
He
followed
the
sound
and
found
his
daughter
back
in
her
bedchamber,
asleep
with
a
babe
at
her
breast.вЂќ

вЂњBael
had
brought
her
back?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
They
had
been
in
Winterfell
all
the
time,
hiding
with
the
dead
beneath
the
castle.
The
maid
loved
Bael
so
dearly
she
bore
him
a
son,
the
song
saysвЂ¦
though
if
truth
be
told,
all
the
maids
love
Bael
in
them
songs
he
wrote.
Be
that
as
it
may,
whatвЂ™s
certain
is
that
Bael
left
the
child
in
payment
for
the
rose
heвЂ™d
plucked
unasked,
and
that
the
boy
grew
to
be
the
next
Lord
Stark.
So
there
it
isвЂ”you
have
BaelвЂ™s
blood
in
you,
same
as
me.вЂќ

вЂњIt
never
happened,вЂќ
Jon
said.

She
shrugged.
вЂњMight
be
it
did,
might
be
it
didnвЂ™t.
It
is
a
good
song,
though.
My
mother
used
to
sing
it
to
me.
She
was
a
woman
too,
Jon
Snow.
Like
yours.вЂќ
She
rubbed
her
throat
where
his
dirk
had
cut
her.
вЂњThe
song
ends
when
they
find
the
babe,
but
there
is
a
darker
end
to
the
story.
Thirty
years
later,
when
Bael
was
King-beyond-the-Wall
and
led
the
free
folk
south,
it
was
young
Lord
Stark
who
met
him
at
the
Frozen
FordвЂ¦
and
killed
him,
for
Bael
would
not
harm
his
own
son
when
they
met
sword
to
sword.вЂќ

вЂњSo
the
son
slew
the
father
instead,вЂќ
said
Jon.

вЂњAye,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњbut
the
gods
hate
kinslayers,
even
when
they
kill
unknowing.
When
Lord
Stark
returned
from
the
battle
and
his
mother
saw
BaelвЂ™s
head
upon
his
spear,
she
threw
herself
from
a
tower
in
her
grief.
Her
son
did
not
long
outlive
her.
One
oвЂ™
his
lords
peeled
the
skin
off
him
and
wore
him
for
a
cloak.вЂќ

вЂњYour
Bael
was
a
liar,вЂќ
he
told
her,
certain
now.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Ygritte
said,
вЂњbut
a
bardвЂ™s
truth
is
different
than
yours
or
mine.
Anyway,
you
asked
for
the
story,
so
I
told
it.вЂќ
She
turned
away
from
him,
closed
her
eyes,
and
seemed
to
sleep.

Dawn
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
arrived
together.
The
black
stones
had
turned
to
grey
and
the
eastern
sky
had
gone
indigo
when
Stonesnake
spied
the
rangers
below,
wending
their
way
upward.
Jon
woke
his
captive
and
held
her
by
the
arm
as
they
descended
to
meet
them.
Thankfully,
there
was
another
way
off
the
mountain
to
the
north
and
west,
along
paths
much
gentler
than
the
one
that
had
brought
them
up
here.
They
were
waiting
in
a
narrow
defile
when
their
brothers
appeared,
leading
their
garrons.
Ghost
raced
ahead
at
first
scent
of
them.
Jon
squatted
to
let
the
direwolf
close
his
jaws
around
his
wrist,
tugging
his
hand
back
and
forth.
It
was
a
game
they
played.
But
when
he
glanced
up,
he
saw
Ygritte
watching
with
eyes
as
wide
and
white
as
henвЂ™s
eggs.

Qhorin
Halfhand
made
no
comment
when
he
saw
the
prisoner.
вЂњThere
were
three,вЂќ
Stonesnake
told
him.
No
more
than
that.

вЂњWe
passed
two,вЂќ
Ebben
said,
вЂњor
what
the
cats
had
left
of
them.вЂќ
He
eyed
the
girl
sourly,
suspicion
plain
on
his
face.

вЂњShe
yielded,вЂќ
Jon
felt
compelled
to
say.

QhorinвЂ™s
face
was
impassive.
вЂњDo
you
know
who
I
am?вЂќ

вЂњQhorin
Halfhand.вЂќ
The
girl
looked
half
a
child
beside
him,
but
she
faced
him
boldly.

вЂњTell
me
true.
If
I
fell
into
the
hands
of
your
people
and
yielded
myself,
what
would
it
win
me?вЂќ

вЂњA
slower
death
than
elsewise.вЂќ

The
big
ranger
looked
to
Jon.
вЂњWe
have
no
food
to
feed
her,
nor
can
we
spare
a
man
to
watch
her.вЂќ

вЂњThe
way
before
us
is
perilous
enough,
lad,вЂќ
said
Squire
Dalbridge.
вЂњOne
shout
when
we
need
silence,
and
every
man
of
us
is
doomed.вЂќ

Ebben
drew
his
dagger.
вЂњA
steel
kiss
will
keep
her
quiet.вЂќ

JonвЂ™s
throat
was
raw.
He
looked
at
them
all
helplessly.
вЂњShe
yielded
herself
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњThen
you
must
do
what
needs
be
done,вЂќ
Qhorin
Halfhand
said.
вЂњYou
are
the
blood
of
Winterfell
and
a
man
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.вЂќ
He
looked
at
the
others.
вЂњCome,
brothers.
Leave
him
to
it.
It
will
go
easier
for
him
if
we
do
not
watch.вЂќ
And
he
led
them
up
the
steep
twisting
trail
toward
the
pale
pink
glow
of
the
sun
where
it
broke
through
a
mountain
cleft,
and
before
very
long
only
Jon
and
Ghost
remained
with
the
wildling
girl.

He
thought
Ygritte
might
try
to
run,
but
she
only
stood
there,
waiting,
looking
at
him.
вЂњYou
never
killed
a
woman
before,
did
you?вЂќ
When
he
shook
his
head,
she
said,
вЂњWe
die
the
same
as
men.
But
you
donвЂ™t
need
to
do
it.
Mance
would
take
you,
I
know
he
would.
ThereвЂ™s
secret
ways.
Them
crows
would
never
catch
us.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
as
much
a
crow
as
they
are,вЂќ
Jon
said.

She
nodded,
resigned.
вЂњWill
you
burn
me,
after?вЂќ

вЂњI
canвЂ™t.
The
smoke
might
be
seen.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
so.вЂќ
She
shrugged.
вЂњWell,
thereвЂ™s
worse
places
to
end
up
than
the
belly
of
a
shadowcat.вЂќ

He
pulled
Longclaw
over
a
shoulder.
вЂњArenвЂ™t
you
afraid?вЂќ

вЂњLast
night
I
was,вЂќ
she
admitted.
вЂњBut
now
the
sunвЂ™s
up.вЂќ
She
pushed
her
hair
aside
to
bare
her
neck,
and
knelt
before
him.
вЂњStrike
hard
and
true,
crow,
or
IвЂ™ll
come
back
and
haunt
you.вЂќ

Longclaw
was
not
so
long
or
heavy
a
sword
as
his
fatherвЂ™s
Ice,
but
it
was
Valyrian
steel
all
the
same.
He
touched
the
edge
of
the
blade
to
mark
where
the
blow
must
fall,
and
Ygritte
shivered.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
cold,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњGo
on,
be
quick
about
it.вЂќ

He
raised
Longclaw
over
his
head,
both
hands
tight
around
the
grip.
One
cut,
with
all
my
weight
behind
it.
He
could
give
her
a
quick
clean
death,
at
least.
He
was
his
fatherвЂ™s
son.
WasnвЂ™t
he?
WasnвЂ™t
he?

вЂњDo
it,вЂќ
she
urged
him
after
a
moment.
вЂњBastard.
Do
it.
I
canвЂ™t
stay
brave
forever.вЂќ
When
the
blow
did
not
fall
she
turned
her
head
to
look
at
him.

Jon
lowered
his
sword.
вЂњGo,вЂќ
he
muttered.

Ygritte
stared.

вЂњNow,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbefore
my
wits
return.
Go.вЂќ

She
went.





SANSA

The
southern
sky
was
black
with
smoke.
It
rose
swirling
off
a
hundred
distant
fires,
its
sooty
fingers
smudging
out
the
stars.
Across
the
Blackwater
Rush,
a
line
of
flame
burned
nightly
from
horizon
to
horizon,
while
on
this
side
the
Imp
had
fired
the
whole
riverfront:
docks
and
warehouses,
homes
and
brothels,
everything
outside
the
city
walls.

Even
in
the
Red
Keep,
the
air
tasted
of
ashes.
When
Sansa
found
Ser
Dontos
in
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
he
asked
if
sheвЂ™d
been
crying.
вЂњItвЂ™s
only
from
the
smoke,вЂќ
she
lied.
вЂњIt
looks
as
though
half
the
kingswood
is
burning.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Stannis
wants
to
smoke
out
the
ImpвЂ™s
savages.вЂќ
Dontos
swayed
as
he
spoke,
one
hand
on
the
trunk
of
a
chestnut
tree.
A
wine
stain
discolored
the
red-and-yellow
motley
of
his
tunic.
вЂњThey
kill
his
scouts
and
raid
his
baggage
train.
And
the
wildlings
have
been
lighting
fires
too.
The
Imp
told
the
queen
that
Stannis
had
better
train
his
horses
to
eat
ash,
since
he
would
find
no
blade
of
grass.
I
heard
him
say
so.
I
hear
all
sorts
of
things
as
a
fool
that
I
never
heard
when
I
was
a
knight.
They
talk
as
though
I
am
not
there,
andвЂќвЂ”he
leaned
close,
breathing
his
winey
breath
right
in
her
faceвЂ”вЂњthe
Spider
pays
in
gold
for
any
little
trifle.
I
think
Moon
Boy
has
been
his
for
years.вЂќ

He
is
drunk
again.
My
poor
Florian
he
names
himself,
and
so
he
is.
But
he
is
all
I
have.
вЂњIs
it
true
Lord
Stannis
burned
the
godswood
at
StormвЂ™s
End?вЂќ

Dontos
nodded.
вЂњHe
made
a
great
pyre
of
the
trees
as
an
offering
to
his
new
god.
The
red
priestess
made
him
do
it.
They
say
she
rules
him
now,
body
and
soul.
HeвЂ™s
vowed
to
burn
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
too,
if
he
takes
the
city.вЂќ

вЂњLet
him.вЂќ
When
Sansa
had
first
beheld
the
Great
Sept
with
its
marble
walls
and
seven
crystal
towers,
sheвЂ™d
thought
it
was
the
most
beautiful
building
in
the
world,
but
that
had
been
before
Joffrey
beheaded
her
father
on
its
steps.
вЂњI
want
it
burned.вЂќ

вЂњHush,
child,
the
gods
will
hear
you.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
they?
They
never
hear
my
prayers.вЂќ

вЂњYes
they
do.
They
sent
me
to
you,
didnвЂ™t
they?вЂќ

Sansa
picked
at
the
bark
of
a
tree.
She
felt
light-headed,
almost
feverish.
вЂњThey
sent
you,
but
what
good
have
you
done?
You
promised
you
would
take
me
home,
but
IвЂ™m
still
here.вЂќ

Dontos
patted
her
arm.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
spoken
to
a
certain
man
I
know,
a
good
friend
to
meвЂ¦
and
you,
my
lady.
He
will
hire
a
swift
ship
to
take
us
to
safety,
when
the
time
is
right.вЂќ

вЂњThe
time
is
right
now,вЂќ
Sansa
insisted,
вЂњbefore
the
fighting
starts.
TheyвЂ™ve
forgotten
about
me.
I
know
we
could
slip
away
if
we
tried.вЂќ

вЂњChild,
child.вЂќ
Dontos
shook
his
head.
вЂњOut
of
the
castle,
yes,
we
could
do
that,
but
the
city
gates
are
more
heavily
guarded
than
ever,
and
the
Imp
has
even
closed
off
the
river.вЂќ

It
was
true.
The
Blackwater
Rush
was
as
empty
as
Sansa
had
ever
seen
it.
All
the
ferries
had
been
withdrawn
to
the
north
bank,
and
the
trading
galleys
had
fled
or
been
seized
by
the
Imp
to
be
made
over
for
battle.
The
only
ships
to
be
seen
were
the
kingвЂ™s
war
galleys.
They
rowed
endlessly
up
and
down,
staying
to
the
deep
water
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
exchanging
flights
of
arrows
with
StannisвЂ™s
archers
on
the
south
shore.

Lord
Stannis
himself
was
still
on
the
march,
but
his
vanguard
had
appeared
two
nights
ago
during
the
black
of
the
moon.
KingвЂ™s
Landing
had
woken
to
the
sight
of
their
tents
and
banners.
They
were
five
thousand,
Sansa
had
heard,
near
as
many
as
all
the
gold
cloaks
in
the
city.
They
flew
the
red
or
green
apples
of
House
Fossoway,
the
turtle
of
Estermont,
and
the
fox-and-flowers
of
Florent,
and
their
commander
was
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen,
a
famous
southron
knight
who
men
now
called
Guyard
the
Green.
His
standard
showed
a
crow
in
flight,
its
black
wings
spread
wide
against
a
storm-green
sky.
But
it
was
the
pale
yellow
banners
that
worried
the
city.
Long
ragged
tails
streamed
behind
them
like
flickering
flames,
and
in
place
of
a
lordвЂ™s
sigil
they
bore
the
device
of
a
god:
the
burning
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light.

вЂњWhen
Stannis
comes,
heвЂ™ll
have
ten
times
as
many
men
as
Joffrey
does,
everyone
says
so.вЂќ

Dontos
squeezed
her
shoulder.
вЂњThe
size
of
his
host
does
not
matter,
sweetling,
so
long
as
they
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
river.
Stannis
cannot
cross
without
ships.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has
ships.
More
than
Joffrey.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
a
long
sail
from
StormвЂ™s
End,
the
fleet
will
need
to
come
up
MasseyвЂ™s
Hook
and
through
the
Gullet
and
across
Blackwater
Bay.
Perhaps
the
good
gods
will
send
a
storm
to
sweep
them
from
the
seas.вЂќ
Dontos
gave
a
hopeful
smile.
вЂњIt
is
not
easy
for
you,
I
know.
You
must
be
patient,
child.
When
my
friend
returns
to
the
city,
we
shall
have
our
ship.
Have
faith
in
your
Florian,
and
try
not
to
be
afraid.вЂќ

Sansa
dug
her
nails
into
her
hand.
She
could
feel
the
fear
in
her
tummy,
twisting
and
pinching,
worse
every
day.
Nightmares
of
the
day
Princess
Myrcella
had
sailed
still
troubled
her
sleep;
dark
suffocating
dreams
that
woke
her
in
the
black
of
night,
struggling
for
breath.
She
could
hear
the
people
screaming
at
her,
screaming
without
words,
like
animals.
They
had
hemmed
her
in
and
thrown
filth
at
her
and
tried
to
pull
her
off
her
horse,
and
would
have
done
worse
if
the
Hound
had
not
cut
his
way
to
her
side.
They
had
torn
the
High
Septon
to
pieces
and
smashed
in
Ser
AronвЂ™s
head
with
a
rock.
Try
not
to
be
afraid!
he
said.

The
whole
city
was
afraid.
Sansa
could
see
it
from
the
castle
walls.
The
smallfolk
were
hiding
themselves
behind
closed
shutters
and
barred
doors
as
if
that
would
keep
them
safe.
The
last
time
KingвЂ™s
Landing
had
fallen,
the
Lannisters
looted
and
raped
as
they
pleased
and
put
hundreds
to
the
sword,
even
though
the
city
had
opened
its
gates.
This
time
the
Imp
meant
to
fight,
and
a
city
that
fought
could
expect
no
mercy
at
all.

Dontos
was
prattling
on.
вЂњIf
I
were
still
a
knight,
I
should
have
to
put
on
armor
and
man
the
walls
with
the
rest.
I
ought
to
kiss
King
JoffreyвЂ™s
feet
and
thank
him
sweetly.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
thanked
him
for
making
you
a
fool,
heвЂ™d
make
you
a
knight
again,вЂќ
Sansa
said
sharply.

Dontos
chuckled.
вЂњMy
JonquilвЂ™s
a
clever
girl,
isnвЂ™t
she?вЂќ

вЂњJoffrey
and
his
mother
say
IвЂ™m
stupid.вЂќ

вЂњLet
them.
YouвЂ™re
safer
that
way,
sweetling.
Queen
Cersei
and
the
Imp
and
Lord
Varys
and
their
like,
they
all
watch
each
other
keen
as
hawks,
and
pay
this
one
and
that
one
to
spy
out
what
the
others
are
doing,
but
no
one
ever
troubles
themselves
about
Lady
TandaвЂ™s
daughter,
do
they?вЂќ
Dontos
covered
his
mouth
to
stifle
a
burp.
вЂњGods
preserve
you,
my
little
Jonquil.вЂќ
He
was
growing
weepy.
The
wine
did
that
to
him.
вЂњGive
your
Florian
a
little
kiss
now.
A
kiss
for
luck.вЂќ
He
swayed
toward
her.

Sansa
dodged
the
wet
groping
lips,
kissed
him
lightly
on
an
unshaven
cheek,
and
bid
him
good
night.
It
took
all
her
strength
not
to
weep.
She
had
been
weeping
too
much
of
late.
It
was
unseemly,
she
knew,
but
she
could
not
seem
to
help
herself;
the
tears
would
come,
sometimes
over
a
trifle,
and
nothing
she
did
could
hold
them
back.

The
drawbridge
to
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast
was
unguarded.
The
Imp
had
moved
most
of
the
gold
cloaks
to
the
city
walls,
and
the
white
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
had
duties
more
important
than
dogging
her
heels.
Sansa
could
go
where
she
would
so
long
as
she
did
not
try
to
leave
the
castle,
but
there
was
nowhere
she
wanted
to
go.

She
crossed
over
the
dry
moat
with
its
cruel
iron
spikes
and
made
her
way
up
the
narrow
turnpike
stair,
but
when
she
reached
the
door
of
her
bedchamber
she
could
not
bear
to
enter.
The
very
walls
of
the
room
made
her
feel
trapped;
even
with
the
window
opened
wide
it
felt
as
though
there
were
no
air
to
breathe.

Turning
back
to
the
stair,
Sansa
climbed.
The
smoke
blotted
out
the
stars
and
the
thin
crescent
of
moon,
so
the
roof
was
dark
and
thick
with
shadows.
Yet
from
here
she
could
see
everything:
the
Red
KeepвЂ™s
tall
towers
and
great
cornerforts,
the
maze
of
city
streets
beyond,
to
south
and
west
the
river
running
black,
the
bay
to
the
east,
the
columns
of
smoke
and
cinders,
and
fires,
fires
everywhere.
Soldiers
crawled
over
the
city
walls
like
ants
with
torches,
and
crowded
the
hoardings
that
had
sprouted
from
the
ramparts.
Down
by
the
Mud
Gate,
outlined
against
the
drifting
smoke,
she
could
make
out
the
vague
shape
of
the
three
huge
catapults,
the
biggest
anyone
had
ever
seen,
overtopping
the
walls
by
a
good
twenty
feet.
Yet
none
of
it
made
her
feel
less
fearful.
A
stab
went
through
her,
so
sharp
that
Sansa
sobbed
and
clutched
at
her
belly.
She
might
have
fallen,
but
a
shadow
moved
suddenly,
and
strong
fingers
grabbed
her
arm
and
steadied
her.

She
grabbed
a
merlon
for
support,
her
fingers
scrabbling
at
the
rough
stone.
вЂњLet
go
of
me,вЂќ
she
cried.
вЂњLet
go.вЂќ

вЂњThe
little
bird
thinks
she
has
wings,
does
she?
Or
do
you
mean
to
end
up
crippled
like
that
brother
of
yours?вЂќ

Sansa
twisted
in
his
grasp.
вЂњI
wasnвЂ™t
going
to
fall.
It
was
onlyвЂ¦
you
startled
me,
thatвЂ™s
all.вЂќ

вЂњYou
mean
I
scared
you.
And
still
do.вЂќ

She
took
a
deep
breath
to
calm
herself.
вЂњI
thought
I
was
alone,
IвЂ¦вЂќ
She
glanced
away.

вЂњThe
little
bird
still
canвЂ™t
bear
to
look
at
me,
can
she?вЂќ
The
Hound
released
her.
вЂњYou
were
glad
enough
to
see
my
face
when
the
mob
had
you,
though.
Remember?вЂќ

Sansa
remembered
all
too
well.
She
remembered
the
way
they
had
howled,
the
feel
of
the
blood
running
down
her
cheek
from
where
the
stone
had
struck
her,
and
the
garlic
stink
on
the
breath
of
the
man
who
had
tried
to
pull
her
from
her
horse.
She
could
still
feel
the
cruel
pinch
of
fingers
on
her
wrist
as
she
lost
her
balance
and
began
to
fall.

SheвЂ™d
thought
she
was
going
to
die
then,
but
the
fingers
had
twitched,
all
five
at
once,
and
the
man
had
shrieked
loud
as
a
horse.
When
his
hand
fell
away,
another
hand,
stronger,
shoved
her
back
into
her
saddle.
The
man
with
the
garlicky
breath
was
on
the
ground,
blood
pumping
out
the
stump
of
his
arm,
but
there
were
others
all
around,
some
with
clubs
in
hand.
The
Hound
leapt
at
them,
his
sword
a
blur
of
steel
that
trailed
a
red
mist
as
it
swung.
When
they
broke
and
ran
before
him
he
had
laughed,
his
terrible
burned
face
for
a
moment
transformed.

She
made
herself
look
at
that
face
now,
really
look.
It
was
only
courteous,
and
a
lady
must
never
forget
her
courtesies.
The
scars
are
not
the
worst
part,
nor
even
the
way
his
mouth
twitches.
ItвЂ™s
his
eyes.
She
had
never
seen
eyes
so
full
of
anger.
вЂњIвЂ¦
I
should
have
come
to
you
after,вЂќ
she
said
haltingly.
вЂњTo
thank
you,
forвЂ¦
for
saving
meвЂ¦
you
were
so
brave.вЂќ

вЂњBrave?вЂќ
His
laugh
was
half
a
snarl.
вЂњA
dog
doesnвЂ™t
need
courage
to
chase
off
rats.
They
had
me
thirty
to
one,
and
not
a
man
of
them
dared
face
me.вЂќ

She
hated
the
way
he
talked,
always
so
harsh
and
angry.
вЂњDoes
it
give
you
joy
to
scare
people?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
it
gives
me
joy
to
kill
people.вЂќ
His
mouth
twitched.
вЂњWrinkle
up
your
face
all
you
like,
but
spare
me
this
false
piety.
You
were
a
high
lordвЂ™s
get.
DonвЂ™t
tell
me
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell
never
killed
a
man.вЂќ

вЂњThat
was
his
duty.
He
never
liked
it.вЂќ

вЂњIs
that
what
he
told
you?вЂќ
Clegane
laughed
again.
вЂњYour
father
lied.
Killing
is
the
sweetest
thing
there
is.вЂќ
He
drew
his
longsword.
вЂњHereвЂ™s
your
truth.
Your
precious
father
found
that
out
on
BaelorвЂ™s
steps.
Lord
of
Winterfell,
Hand
of
the
King,
Warden
of
the
North,
the
mighty
Eddard
Stark,
of
a
line
eight
thousand
years
oldвЂ¦
but
Ilyn
PayneвЂ™s
blade
went
through
his
neck
all
the
same,
didnвЂ™t
it?
Do
you
remember
the
dance
he
did
when
his
head
came
off
his
shoulders?вЂќ

Sansa
hugged
herself,
suddenly
cold.
вЂњWhy
are
you
always
so
hateful?
I
was
thanking
youвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњJust
as
if
I
was
one
of
those
true
knights
you
love
so
well,
yes.
What
do
you
think
a
knight
is
for,
girl?
You
think
itвЂ™s
all
taking
favors
from
ladies
and
looking
fine
in
gold
plate?
Knights
are
for
killing.вЂќ
He
laid
the
edge
of
his
longsword
against
her
neck,
just
under
her
ear.
Sansa
could
feel
the
sharpness
of
the
steel.
вЂњI
killed
my
first
man
at
twelve.
IвЂ™ve
lost
count
of
how
many
IвЂ™ve
killed
since
then.
High
lords
with
old
names,
fat
rich
men
dressed
in
velvet,
knights
puffed
up
like
bladders
with
their
honors,
yes,
and
women
and
children
tooвЂ”theyвЂ™re
all
meat,
and
IвЂ™m
the
butcher.
Let
them
have
their
lands
and
their
gods
and
their
gold.
Let
them
have
their
sers.вЂќ
Sandor
Clegane
spat
at
her
feet
to
show
what
he
thought
of
that.
вЂњSo
long
as
I
have
this,вЂќ
he
said,
lifting
the
sword
from
her
throat,
вЂњthereвЂ™s
no
man
on
earth
I
need
fear.вЂќ

Except
your
brother,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
had
better
sense
than
to
say
it
aloud.
He
is
a
dog,
just
as
he
says.
A
half-wild,
mean-tempered
dog
that
bites
any
hand
that
tries
to
pet
him,
and
yet
will
savage
any
man
who
tries
to
hurt
his
masters.
вЂњNot
even
the
men
across
the
river?вЂќ

CleganeвЂ™s
eyes
turned
toward
the
distant
fires.
вЂњAll
this
burning.вЂќ
He
sheathed
his
sword.
вЂњOnly
cowards
fight
with
fire.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Stannis
is
no
coward.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
not
the
man
his
brother
was
either.
Robert
never
let
a
little
thing
like
a
river
stop
him.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
will
you
do
when
he
crosses?вЂќ

вЂњFight.
Kill.
Die,
maybe.вЂќ

вЂњArenвЂ™t
you
afraid?
The
gods
might
send
you
down
to
some
terrible
hell
for
all
the
evil
youвЂ™ve
done.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
evil?вЂќ
He
laughed.
вЂњWhat
gods?вЂќ

вЂњThe
gods
who
made
us
all.вЂќ

вЂњAll?вЂќ
he
mocked.
вЂњTell
me,
little
bird,
what
kind
of
god
makes
a
monster
like
the
Imp,
or
a
halfwit
like
Lady
TandaвЂ™s
daughter?
If
there
are
gods,
they
made
sheep
so
wolves
could
eat
mutton,
and
they
made
the
weak
for
the
strong
to
play
with.вЂќ

вЂњTrue
knights
protect
the
weak.вЂќ

He
snorted.
вЂњThere
are
no
true
knights,
no
more
than
there
are
gods.
If
you
canвЂ™t
protect
yourself,
die
and
get
out
of
the
way
of
those
who
can.
Sharp
steel
and
strong
arms
rule
this
world,
donвЂ™t
ever
believe
any
different.вЂќ

Sansa
backed
away
from
him.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
awful.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
honest.
ItвЂ™s
the
world
thatвЂ™s
awful.
Now
fly
away,
little
bird,
IвЂ™m
sick
of
you
peeping
at
me.вЂќ

Wordless,
she
fled.
She
was
afraid
of
Sandor
CleganeвЂ¦
and
yet,
some
part
of
her
wished
that
Ser
Dontos
had
a
little
of
the
HoundвЂ™s
ferocity.
There
are
gods,
she
told
herself,
and
there
are
true
knights
too.
All
the
stories
canвЂ™t
be
lies.

That
night
Sansa
dreamed
of
the
riot
again.
The
mob
surged
around
her,
shrieking,
a
maddened
beast
with
a
thousand
faces.
Everywhere
she
turned
she
saw
faces
twisted
into
monstrous
inhuman
masks.
She
wept
and
told
them
she
had
never
done
them
hurt,
yet
they
dragged
her
from
her
horse
all
the
same.
вЂњNo,вЂќ
she
cried,
вЂњno,
please,
donвЂ™t,
donвЂ™t,вЂќ
but
no
one
paid
her
any
heed.
She
shouted
for
Ser
Dontos,
for
her
brothers,
for
her
dead
father
and
her
dead
wolf,
for
gallant
Ser
Loras
who
had
given
her
a
red
rose
once,
but
none
of
them
came.
She
called
for
the
heroes
from
the
songs,
for
Florian
and
Ser
Ryam
Redwyne
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
but
no
one
heard.
Women
swarmed
over
her
like
weasels,
pinching
her
legs
and
kicking
her
in
the
belly,
and
someone
hit
her
in
the
face
and
she
felt
her
teeth
shatter.
Then
she
saw
the
bright
glimmer
of
steel.
The
knife
plunged
into
her
belly
and
tore
and
tore
and
tore,
until
there
was
nothing
left
of
her
down
there
but
shiny
wet
ribbons.

When
she
woke,
the
pale
light
of
morning
was
slanting
through
her
window,
yet
she
felt
as
sick
and
achy
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at
all.
There
was
something
sticky
on
her
thighs.
When
she
threw
back
the
blanket
and
saw
the
blood,
all
she
could
think
was
that
her
dream
had
somehow
come
true.
She
remembered
the
knives
inside
her,
twisting
and
ripping.
She
squirmed
away
in
horror,
kicking
at
the
sheets
and
falling
to
the
floor,
breathing
raggedly,
naked,
bloodied,
and
afraid.

But
as
she
crouched
there,
on
her
hands
and
knees,
understanding
came.
вЂњNo,
please,вЂќ
Sansa
whimpered,
вЂњplease,
no.вЂќ
She
didnвЂ™t
want
this
happening
to
her,
not
now,
not
here,
not
now,
not
now,
not
now,
not
now.

Madness
took
hold
of
her.
Pulling
herself
up
by
the
bedpost,
she
went
to
the
basin
and
washed
between
her
legs,
scrubbing
away
all
the
stickiness.
By
the
time
she
was
done,
the
water
was
pink
with
blood.
When
her
maidservants
saw
it
they
would
know.
Then
she
remembered
the
bedclothes.
She
rushed
back
to
the
bed
and
stared
in
horror
at
the
dark
red
stain
and
the
tale
it
told.
All
she
could
think
was
that
she
had
to
get
rid
of
it,
or
else
theyвЂ™d
see.
She
couldnвЂ™t
let
them
see,
or
theyвЂ™d
marry
her
to
Joffrey
and
make
her
lay
with
him.

Snatching
up
her
knife,
Sana
hacked
at
the
sheet,
cutting
out
the
stain.
If
they
ask
me
about
the
hole,
what
will
I
say?
Tears
ran
down
her
face.
She
pulled
the
torn
sheet
from
the
bed,
and
the
stained
blanket
as
well.
IвЂ™ll
have
to
burn
them.
She
balled
up
the
evidence,
stuffed
it
in
the
fireplace,
drenched
it
in
oil
from
her
bedside
lamp,
and
lit
it
afire.
Then
she
realized
that
the
blood
had
soaked
through
the
sheet
into
the
featherbed,
so
she
bundled
that
up
as
well,
but
it
was
big
and
cumbersome,
hard
to
move.
Sansa
could
get
only
half
of
it
into
the
fire.
She
was
on
her
knees,
struggling
to
shove
the
mattress
into
the
flames
as
thick
grey
smoke
eddied
around
her
and
filled
the
room,
when
the
door
burst
open
and
she
heard
her
maid
gasp.

In
the
end
it
took
three
of
them
to
pull
her
away.
And
it
was
all
for
nothing.
The
bedclothes
were
burnt,
but
by
the
time
they
carried
her
off
her
thighs
were
bloody
again.
It
was
as
if
her
own
body
had
betrayed
her
to
Joffrey,
unfurling
a
banner
of
Lannister
crimson
for
all
the
world
to
see.

When
the
fire
was
out,
they
carried
off
the
singed
featherbed,
fanned
away
the
worst
of
the
smoke,
and
brought
up
a
tub.
Women
came
and
went,
muttering
and
looking
at
her
strangely.
They
filled
the
tub
with
scalding
hot
water,
bathed
her
and
washed
her
hair
and
gave
her
a
cloth
to
wear
between
her
legs.
By
then
Sansa
was
calm
again,
and
ashamed
for
her
folly.
The
smoke
had
ruined
most
of
her
clothing.
One
of
the
women
went
away
and
came
back
with
a
green
wool
shift
that
was
almost
her
size.
вЂњItвЂ™s
not
as
pretty
as
your
own
things,
but
it
will
serve,вЂќ
she
announced
when
sheвЂ™d
pulled
it
down
over
SansaвЂ™s
head.
вЂњYour
shoes
werenвЂ™t
burned,
so
at
least
you
wonвЂ™t
need
to
go
barefoot
to
the
queen.вЂќ

Cersei
Lannister
was
breaking
her
fast
when
Sansa
was
ushered
into
her
solar.
вЂњYou
may
sit,вЂќ
the
queen
said
graciously.
вЂњAre
you
hungry?вЂќ
She
gestured
at
the
table.
There
was
porridge,
honey,
milk,
boiled
eggs,
and
crisp
fried
fish.

The
sight
of
the
food
made
Sansa
feel
ill.
Her
tummy
was
tied
in
a
knot.
вЂњNo,
thank
you,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
blame
you.
Between
Tyrion
and
Lord
Stannis,
everything
I
eat
tastes
of
ash.
And
now
youвЂ™re
setting
fires
as
well.
What
did
you
hope
to
accomplish?вЂќ

Sansa
lowered
her
head.
вЂњThe
blood
frightened
me.вЂќ

вЂњThe
blood
is
the
seal
of
your
womanhood.
Lady
Catelyn
might
have
prepared
you.
YouвЂ™ve
had
your
first
flowering,
no
more.вЂќ

Sansa
had
never
felt
less
flowery.
вЂњMy
lady
mother
told
me,
but
IвЂ¦
I
thought
it
would
be
different.вЂќ

вЂњDifferent
how?вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
know.
LessвЂ¦
less
messy,
and
more
magical.вЂќ

Queen
Cersei
laughed.
вЂњWait
until
you
birth
a
child,
Sansa.
A
womanвЂ™s
life
is
nine
parts
mess
to
one
part
magic,
youвЂ™ll
learn
that
soon
enoughвЂ¦
and
the
parts
that
look
like
magic
often
turn
out
to
be
messiest
of
all.вЂќ
She
took
a
sip
of
milk.
вЂњSo
now
you
are
a
woman.
Do
you
have
the
least
idea
of
what
that
means?вЂќ

вЂњIt
means
that
I
am
now
fit
to
be
wedded
and
bedded,вЂќ
said
Sansa,
вЂњand
to
bear
children
for
the
king.вЂќ

The
queen
gave
a
wry
smile.
вЂњA
prospect
that
no
longer
entices
you
as
it
once
did,
I
can
see.
I
will
not
fault
you
for
that.
Joffrey
has
always
been
difficult.
Even
his
birthвЂ¦
I
labored
a
day
and
a
half
to
bring
him
forth.
You
cannot
imagine
the
pain,
Sansa.
I
screamed
so
loudly
that
I
fancied
Robert
might
hear
me
in
the
kingswood.вЂќ

вЂњHis
Grace
was
not
with
you?вЂќ

вЂњRobert?
Robert
was
hunting.
That
was
his
custom.
Whenever
my
time
was
near,
my
royal
husband
would
flee
to
the
trees
with
his
huntsmen
and
hounds.
When
he
returned
he
would
present
me
with
some
pelts
or
a
stagвЂ™s
head,
and
I
would
present
him
with
a
baby.

вЂњNot
that
I
wanted
him
to
stay,
mind
you.
I
had
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
and
an
army
of
midwives,
and
I
had
my
brother.
When
they
told
Jaime
he
was
not
allowed
in
the
birthing
room,
he
smiled
and
asked
which
of
them
proposed
to
keep
him
out.

вЂњJoffrey
will
show
you
no
such
devotion,
I
fear.
You
could
thank
your
sister
for
that,
if
she
werenвЂ™t
dead.
HeвЂ™s
never
been
able
to
forget
that
day
on
the
Trident
when
you
saw
her
shame
him,
so
he
shames
you
in
turn.
YouвЂ™re
stronger
than
you
seem,
though.
I
expect
youвЂ™ll
survive
a
bit
of
humiliation.
I
did.
You
may
never
love
the
king,
but
youвЂ™ll
love
his
children.вЂќ

вЂњI
love
His
Grace
with
all
my
heart,вЂќ
Sansa
said.

The
queen
sighed.
вЂњYou
had
best
learn
some
new
lies,
and
quickly.
Lord
Stannis
will
not
like
that
one,
I
promise
you.вЂќ

вЂњThe
new
High
Septon
said
that
the
gods
will
never
permit
Lord
Stannis
to
win,
since
Joffrey
is
the
rightful
king.вЂќ

A
half
smile
flickered
across
the
queenвЂ™s
face.
вЂњRobertвЂ™s
trueborn
son
and
heir.
Though
Joff
would
cry
whenever
Robert
picked
him
up.
His
Grace
did
not
like
that.
His
bastards
had
always
gurgled
at
him
happily,
and
sucked
his
finger
when
he
put
it
in
their
little
baseborn
mouths.
Robert
wanted
smiles
and
cheers,
always,
so
he
went
where
he
found
them,
to
his
friends
and
his
whores.
Robert
wanted
to
be
loved.
My
brother
Tyrion
has
the
same
disease.
Do
you
want
to
be
loved,
Sansa?вЂќ

вЂњEveryone
wants
to
be
loved.вЂќ

вЂњI
see
flowering
hasnвЂ™t
made
you
any
brighter,вЂќ
said
Cersei.
вЂњSansa,
permit
me
to
share
a
bit
of
womanly
wisdom
with
you
on
this
very
special
day.
Love
is
poison.
A
sweet
poison,
yes,
but
it
will
kill
you
all
the
same.вЂќ





JON

It
was
dark
in
the
Skirling
Pass.
The
great
stone
flanks
of
the
mountains
hid
the
sun
for
most
of
the
day,
so
they
rode
in
shadow,
the
breath
of
man
and
horse
steaming
in
the
cold
air.
Icy
fingers
of
water
trickled
down
from
the
snowpack
above
into
small
frozen
pools
that
cracked
and
broke
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
garrons.
Sometimes
they
would
see
a
few
weeds
struggling
from
some
crack
in
the
rock
or
a
splotch
of
pale
lichen,
but
there
was
no
grass,
and
they
were
above
the
trees
now.

The
track
was
as
steep
as
it
was
narrow,
wending
its
way
ever
upward.
Where
the
pass
was
so
constricted
that
rangers
had
to
go
single
file,
Squire
Dalbridge
would
take
the
lead,
scanning
the
heights
as
he
went,
his
longbow
ever
close
to
hand.
It
was
said
he
had
the
keenest
eyes
in
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.

Ghost
padded
restlessly
by
JonвЂ™s
side.
From
time
to
time
he
would
stop
and
turn,
his
ears
pricked,
as
if
he
heard
something
behind
them.
Jon
did
not
think
the
shadowcats
would
attack
living
men,
not
unless
they
were
starving,
but
he
loosened
Longclaw
in
its
scabbard
even
so.

A
wind-carved
arch
of
grey
stone
marked
the
highest
point
of
the
pass.
Here
the
way
broadened
as
it
began
its
long
descent
toward
the
valley
of
the
Milkwater.
Qhorin
decreed
that
they
would
rest
here
until
the
shadows
began
to
grow
again.
вЂњShadows
are
friends
to
men
in
black,вЂќ
he
said.

Jon
saw
the
sense
of
that.
It
would
be
pleasant
to
ride
in
the
light
for
a
time,
to
let
the
bright
mountain
sun
soak
through
their
cloaks
and
chase
the
chill
from
their
bones,
but
they
dared
not.
Where
there
were
three
watchers
there
might
be
others,
waiting
to
sound
the
alarm.

Stonesnake
curled
up
under
his
ragged
fur
cloak
and
was
asleep
almost
at
once.
Jon
shared
his
salt
beef
with
Ghost
while
Ebben
and
Squire
Dalbridge
fed
the
horses.
Qhorin
Halfhand
sat
with
his
back
to
a
rock,
honing
the
edge
of
his
longsword
with
long
slow
strokes.
Jon
watched
the
ranger
for
a
few
moments,
then
summoned
his
courage
and
went
to
him.
вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњyou
never
asked
me
how
it
went.
With
the
girl.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
no
lord,
Jon
Snow.вЂќ
Qhorin
slid
the
stone
smoothly
along
the
steel
with
his
two-fingered
hand.

вЂњShe
told
me
Mance
would
take
me,
if
I
ran
with
her.вЂќ

вЂњShe
told
you
true.вЂќ

вЂњShe
even
claimed
we
were
kin.
She
told
me
a
storyвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦of
Bael
the
Bard
and
the
rose
of
Winterfell.
So
Stonesnake
told
me.
It
happens
I
know
the
song.
Mance
would
sing
it
of
old,
when
he
came
back
from
a
ranging.
He
had
a
passion
for
wildling
music.
Aye,
and
for
their
women
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњYou
knew
him?вЂќ

вЂњWe
all
knew
him.вЂќ
His
voice
was
sad.

They
were
friends
as
well
as
brothers,
Jon
realized,
and
now
they
are
sworn
foes.
вЂњWhy
did
he
desert?вЂќ

вЂњFor
a
wench,
some
say.
For
a
crown,
others
would
have
it.вЂќ
Qhorin
tested
the
edge
of
his
sword
with
the
ball
of
his
thumb.
вЂњHe
liked
women,
Mance
did,
and
he
was
not
a
man
whose
knees
bent
easily,
thatвЂ™s
true.
But
it
was
more
than
that.
He
loved
the
wild
better
than
the
Wall.
It
was
in
his
blood.
He
was
wildling
born,
taken
as
a
child
when
some
raiders
were
put
to
the
sword.
When
he
left
the
Shadow
Tower
he
was
only
going
home
again.вЂќ

вЂњWas
he
a
good
ranger?вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
the
best
of
us,вЂќ
said
the
Halfhand,
вЂњand
the
worst
as
well.
Only
fools
like
Thoren
Smallwood
despise
the
wildlings.
They
are
as
brave
as
we
are,
Jon.
As
strong,
as
quick,
as
clever.
But
they
have
no
discipline.
They
name
themselves
the
free
folk,
and
each
one
thinks
himself
as
good
as
a
king
and
wiser
than
a
maester.
Mance
was
the
same.
He
never
learned
how
to
obey.вЂќ

вЂњNo
more
than
me,вЂќ
said
Jon
quietly.

QhorinвЂ™s
shrewd
grey
eyes
seemed
to
see
right
through
him.
вЂњSo
you
let
her
go?вЂќ
He
did
not
sound
the
least
surprised.

вЂњYou
know?вЂќ

вЂњNow.
Tell
me
why
you
spared
her.вЂќ

It
was
hard
to
put
into
words.
вЂњMy
father
never
used
a
headsman.
He
said
he
owed
it
to
men
he
killed
to
look
into
their
eyes
and
hear
their
last
words.
And
when
I
looked
into
YgritteвЂ™s
eyes,
IвЂ¦вЂќ
Jon
stared
down
at
his
hands
helplessly.
вЂњI
know
she
was
an
enemy,
but
there
was
no
evil
in
her.вЂќ

вЂњNo
more
than
in
the
other
two.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
their
lives
or
ours
Jon
said.
вЂњIf
they
had
seen
us,
if
they
had
sounded
that
hornвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
wildlings
would
hunt
us
down
and
slay
us,
true
enough.вЂќ

вЂњStonesnake
has
the
horn
now,
though,
and
we
took
YgritteвЂ™s
knife
and
axe.
SheвЂ™s
behind
us,
afoot,
unarmedвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAnd
not
like
to
be
a
threat,вЂќ
Qhorin
agreed.
вЂњIf
I
had
needed
her
dead,
I
would
have
left
her
with
Ebben,
or
done
the
thing
myself.вЂќ

вЂњThen
why
did
you
command
it
of
me?вЂќ

вЂњI
did
not
command
it.
I
told
you
to
do
what
needed
to
be
done,
and
left
you
to
decide
what
that
would
be.вЂќ
Qhorin
stood
and
slid
his
longsword
back
into
its
scabbard.
вЂњWhen
I
want
a
mountain
scaled,
I
call
on
Stonesnake.
Should
I
need
to
put
an
arrow
through
the
eye
of
some
foe
across
a
windy
battlefield,
I
summon
Squire
Dalbridge.
Ebben
can
make
any
man
give
up
his
secrets.
To
lead
men
you
must
know
them,
Jon
Snow.
I
know
more
of
you
now
than
I
did
this
morning.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
I
had
slain
her?вЂќ
asked
Jon.

вЂњShe
would
be
dead,
and
I
would
know
you
better
than
I
had
before.
But
enough
talk.
You
ought
be
sleeping.
We
have
leagues
to
go,
and
dangers
to
face.
You
will
need
your
strength.вЂќ

Jon
did
not
think
sleep
would
come
easily,
but
he
knew
the
Halfhand
was
right.
He
found
a
place
out
of
the
wind,
beneath
an
overhang
of
rock,
and
took
off
his
cloak
to
use
it
for
a
blanket.
вЂњGhost,вЂќ
he
called.
вЂњHere.
To
me.вЂќ
He
always
slept
better
with
the
great
white
wolf
beside
him;
there
was
comfort
in
the
smell
of
him,
and
welcome
warmth
in
that
shaggy
pale
fur.
This
time,
though,
Ghost
did
no
more
than
look
at
him.
Then
he
turned
away
and
padded
around
the
garrons,
and
quick
as
that
he
was
gone.
He
wants
to
hunt,
Jon
thought.
Perhaps
there
were
goats
in
these
mountains.
The
shadowcats
must
live
on
something.
вЂњJust
donвЂ™t
try
and
bring
down
a
вЂ™cat,вЂќ
he
muttered.
Even
for
a
direwolf,
that
would
be
dangerous.
He
tugged
his
cloak
over
him
and
stretched
out
beneath
the
rock.

When
he
closed
his
eyes,
he
dreamed
of
direwolves.

There
were
five
of
them
when
there
should
have
been
six,
and
they
were
scattered,
each
apart
from
the
others.
He
felt
a
deep
ache
of
emptiness,
a
sense
of
incompleteness.
The
forest
was
vast
and
cold,
and
they
were
so
small,
so
lost.
His
brothers
were
out
there
somewhere,
and
his
sister,
but
he
had
lost
their
scent.
He
sat
on
his
haunches
and
lifted
his
head
to
the
darkening
sky,
and
his
cry
echoed
through
the
forest,
a
long
lonely
mournful
sound.
As
it
died
away,
he
pricked
up
his
ears,
listening
for
an
answer,
but
the
only
sound
was
the
sigh
of
blowing
snow.

Jon?

The
call
came
from
behind
him,
softer
than
a
whisper,
but
strong
too.
Can
a
shout
be
silent?
He
turned
his
head,
searching
for
his
brother,
for
a
glimpse
of
a
lean
grey
shape
moving
beneath
the
trees,
but
there
was
nothing,
onlyвЂ¦

A
weirwood.

It
seemed
to
sprout
from
solid
rock,
its
pale
roots
twisting
up
from
a
myriad
of
fissures
and
hairline
cracks.
The
tree
was
slender
compared
to
other
weirwoods
he
had
seen,
no
more
than
a
sapling,
yet
it
was
growing
as
he
watched,
its
limbs
thickening
as
they
reached
for
the
sky.
Wary,
he
circled
the
smooth
white
trunk
until
he
came
to
the
face.
Red
eyes
looked
at
him.
Fierce
eyes
they
were,
yet
glad
to
see
him.
The
weirwood
had
his
brotherвЂ™s
face.
Had
his
brother
always
had
three
eyes?

Not
always,
came
the
silent
shout.
Not
before
the
crow.

He
sniffed
at
the
bark,
smelled
wolf
and
tree
and
boy,
but
behind
that
there
were
other
scents,
the
rich
brown
smell
of
warm
earth
and
the
hard
grey
smell
of
stone
and
something
else,
something
terrible.
Death,
he
knew.
He
was
smelling
death.
He
cringed
back,
his
hair
bristling,
and
bared
his
fangs.

DonвЂ™t
be
afraid,
I
like
it
in
the
dark.
No
one
can
see
you,
but
you
can
see
them.
But
first
you
have
to
open
your
eyes.
See?
Like
this.
And
the
tree
reached
down
and
touched
him.

And
suddenly
he
was
back
in
the
mountains,
his
paws
sunk
deep
in
a
drift
of
snow
as
he
stood
upon
the
edge
of
a
great
precipice.
Before
him
the
Skirling
Pass
opened
up
into
airy
emptiness,
and
a
long
vee-shaped
valley
lay
spread
beneath
him
like
a
quilt,
awash
in
all
the
colors
of
an
autumn
afternoon.

A
vast
blue-white
wall
plugged
one
end
of
the
vale,
squeezing
between
the
mountains
as
if
it
had
shouldered
them
aside,
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
dreamed
himself
back
to
Castle
Black.
Then
he
realized
he
was
looking
at
a
river
of
ice
several
thousand
feet
high.
Under
that
glittering
cold
cliff
was
a
great
lake,
its
deep
cobalt
waters
reflecting
the
snowcapped
peaks
that
ringed
it.
There
were
men
down
in
the
valley,
he
saw
now;
many
men,
thousands,
a
huge
host.
Some
were
tearing
great
holes
in
the
half-frozen
ground,
while
others
trained
for
war.
He
watched
as
a
swarming
mass
of
riders
charged
a
shield
wall,
astride
horses
no
larger
than
ants.
The
sound
of
their
mock
battle
was
a
rustling
of
steel
leaves,
drifting
faintly
on
the
wind.
Their
encampment
had
no
plan
to
it;
he
saw
no
ditches,
no
sharpened
stakes,
no
neat
rows
of
horse
lines.
Everywhere
crude
earthen
shelters
and
hide
tents
sprouted
haphazardly,
like
a
pox
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
He
spied
untidy
mounds
of
hay,
smelled
goats
and
sheep,
horses
and
pigs,
dogs
in
great
profusion.
Tendrils
of
dark
smoke
rose
from
a
thousand
cookfires.

This
is
no
army,
no
more
than
it
is
a
town.
This
is
a
whole
people
come
together.

Across
the
long
lake,
one
of
the
mounds
moved.
He
watched
it
more
closely
and
saw
that
it
was
not
dirt
at
all,
but
alive,
a
shaggy
lumbering
beast
with
a
snake
for
a
nose
and
tusks
larger
than
those
of
the
greatest
boar
that
had
ever
lived.
And
the
thing
riding
it
was
huge
as
well,
and
his
shape
was
wrong,
too
thick
in
the
leg
and
hips
to
be
a
man.

Then
a
sudden
gust
of
cold
made
his
fur
stand
up,
and
the
air
thrilled
to
the
sound
of
wings.
As
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
ice-white
mountain
heights
above,
a
shadow
plummeted
out
of
the
sky.
A
shrill
scream
split
the
air.
He
glimpsed
blue-grey
pinions
spread
wide,
shutting
out
the
sunвЂ¦

вЂњGhost!вЂќ
Jon
shouted,
sitting
up.
He
could
still
feel
the
talons,
the
pain.
вЂњGhost,
to
me!вЂќ

Ebben
appeared,
grabbed
him,
shook
him.
вЂњQuiet!
You
mean
to
bring
the
wildlings
down
on
us?
WhatвЂ™s
wrong
with
you,
boy?вЂќ

вЂњA
dream,вЂќ
said
Jon
feebly.
вЂњI
was
Ghost,
I
was
on
the
edge
of
the
mountain
looking
down
on
a
frozen
river,
and
something
attacked
me.
A
birdвЂ¦
an
eagle,
I
thinkвЂ¦вЂќ

Squire
Dalbridge
smiled.
вЂњItвЂ™s
always
pretty
women
in
my
dreams.
Would
that
I
dreamed
more
often.вЂќ

Qhorin
came
up
beside
him.
вЂњA
frozen
river,
you
say?вЂќ

вЂњThe
Milkwater
flows
from
a
great
lake
at
the
foot
of
a
glacier,вЂќ
Stonesnake
put
in.

вЂњThere
was
a
tree
with
my
brotherвЂ™s
face.
The
wildlingsвЂ¦
there
were
thousands,
more
than
I
ever
knew
existed.
And
giants
riding
mammoths.вЂќ
From
the
way
the
light
had
shifted,
Jon
judged
that
he
had
been
asleep
for
four
or
five
hours.
His
head
ached,
and
the
back
of
his
neck
where
the
talons
had
burned
through
him.
But
that
was
in
the
dream.

вЂњTell
me
all
that
you
remember,
from
first
to
last,вЂќ
said
Qhorin
Halfhand.

Jon
was
confused.
вЂњIt
was
only
a
dream.вЂќ

вЂњA
wolf
dream,вЂќ
the
Halfhand
said.
вЂњCraster
told
the
Lord
Commander
that
the
wildlings
were
gathering
at
the
source
of
the
Milkwater.
That
may
be
why
you
dreamed
it.
Or
it
may
be
that
you
saw
what
waits
for
us,
a
few
hours
farther
on.
Tell
me.вЂќ
It
made
him
feel
half
a
fool
to
talk
of
such
things
to
Qhorin
and
the
other
rangers,
but
he
did
as
he
was
commanded.
None
of
the
black
brothers
laughed
at
him,
however.
By
the
time
he
was
done,
even
Squire
Dalbridge
was
no
longer
smiling.

вЂњSkinchanger?вЂќ
said
Ebben
grimly,
looking
at
the
Halfhand.
Does
he
mean
the
eagle?
Jon
wondered.
Or
me?
Skinchangers
and
wargs
belonged
in
Old
NanвЂ™s
stories,
not
in
the
world
he
had
lived
in
all
his
life.
Yet
here,
in
this
strange
bleak
wilderness
of
rock
and
ice,
it
was
not
hard
to
believe.

вЂњThe
cold
winds
are
rising.
Mormont
feared
as
much.
Benjen
Stark
felt
it
as
well.
Dead
men
walk
and
the
trees
have
eyes
again.
Why
should
we
balk
at
wargs
and
giants?вЂќ

вЂњDoes
this
mean
my
dreams
are
true
as
well?вЂќ
asked
Squire
Dalbridge.
вЂњLord
Snow
can
keep
his
mammoths,
I
want
my
women.вЂќ

вЂњMan
and
boy
IвЂ™ve
served
the
Watch,
and
ranged
as
far
as
any,вЂќ
said
Ebben.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
seen
the
bones
of
giants,
and
heard
many
a
queer
tale,
but
no
more.
I
want
to
see
them
with
my
own
eyes.вЂќ

вЂњBe
careful
they
donвЂ™t
see
you,
Ebben,вЂќ
Stonesnake
said.

Ghost
did
not
reappear
as
they
set
out
again.
The
shadows
covered
the
floor
of
the
pass
by
then,
and
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
toward
the
jagged
twin
peaks
of
the
huge
mountain
the
rangers
named
Forktop.
If
the
dream
was
trueвЂ¦
Even
the
thought
scared
him.
Could
the
eagle
have
hurt
Ghost,
or
knocked
him
off
the
precipice?
And
what
about
the
weirwood
with
his
brotherвЂ™s
face,
that
smelled
of
death
and
darkness?

The
last
ray
of
sun
vanished
behind
the
peaks
of
Forktop.
Twilight
filled
the
Skirling
Pass.
It
seemed
to
grow
colder
almost
at
once.
They
were
no
longer
climbing.
In
fact,
the
ground
had
begun
to
descend,
though
as
yet
not
sharply.
It
was
littered
with
cracks
and
broken
boulders
and
tumbled
heaps
of
rock.
It
will
be
dark
soon,
and
still
no
sight
of
Ghost.
It
was
tearing
Jon
apart,
yet
he
dare
not
shout
for
the
direwolf
as
he
would
have
liked.
Other
things
might
be
listening
as
well.

вЂњQhorin,вЂќ
Squire
Dalbridge
called
softly.
вЂњThere.
Look.вЂќ

The
eagle
was
perched
on
a
spine
of
rock
far
above
them,
outlined
against
the
darkening
sky.
WeвЂ™ve
seen
other
eagles,
Jon
thought.
That
need
not
be
the
one
I
dreamed
of.

Even
so,
Ebben
would
have
loosed
a
shaft
at
it,
but
the
squire
stopped
him.
вЂњThe
birdвЂ™s
well
out
of
bowshot.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
like
it
watching
us.вЂќ

The
squire
shrugged.
вЂњNor
me,
but
you
wonвЂ™t
stop
it.
Only
waste
a
good
arrow.вЂќ

Qhorin
sat
in
his
saddle,
studying
the
eagle
for
a
long
time.
вЂњWe
press
on,вЂќ
he
finally
said.
The
rangers
resumed
their
descent.

Ghost,
Jon
wanted
to
shout,
where
are
you?

He
was
about
to
follow
Qhorin
and
the
others
when
he
glimpsed
a
flash
of
white
between
two
boulders.
A
patch
of
old
snow,
he
thought,
until
he
saw
it
stir.
He
was
off
his
horse
at
once.
As
he
went
to
his
knees,
Ghost
lifted
his
head.
His
neck
glistened
wetly,
but
he
made
no
sound
when
Jon
peeled
off
a
glove
and
touched
him.
The
talons
had
torn
a
bloody
path
through
fur
and
flesh,
but
the
bird
had
not
been
able
to
snap
his
neck.

Qhorin
Halfhand
was
standing
over
him.
вЂњHow
bad?вЂќ

As
if
in
answer,
Ghost
struggled
to
his
feet.

вЂњThe
wolf
is
strong,вЂќ
the
ranger
said.
вЂњEbben,
water.
Stonesnake,
your
skin
of
wine.
Hold
him
still,
Jon.вЂќ

Together
they
washed
the
caked
blood
from
the
direwolfвЂ™s
fur.
Ghost
struggled
and
bared
his
teeth
when
Qhorin
poured
the
wine
into
the
ragged
red
gashes
the
eagle
had
left
him,
but
Jon
wrapped
his
arms
around
him
and
murmured
soothing
words,
and
soon
enough
the
wolf
quieted.
By
the
time
theyвЂ™d
ripped
a
strip
from
JonвЂ™s
cloak
to
wrap
the
wounds,
full
dark
had
settled.
Only
a
dusting
of
stars
set
the
black
of
sky
apart
from
the
black
of
stone.
вЂњDo
we
press
on?вЂќ
Stonesnake
wanted
to
know.

Qhorin
went
to
his
garron.
вЂњBack,
not
on.вЂќ

вЂњBack?вЂќ
Jon
was
taken
by
surprise.

вЂњEagles
have
sharper
eyes
than
men.
We
are
seen.
So
now
we
run.вЂќ
The
Halfhand
wound
a
long
black
scarf
around
his
face
and
swung
up
into
the
saddle.

The
other
rangers
exchanged
a
look,
but
no
man
thought
to
argue.
One
by
one
they
mounted
and
turned
their
mounts
toward
home.
вЂњGhost,
come,вЂќ
he
called,
and
the
direwolf
followed,
a
pale
shadow
moving
through
the
night.

All
night
they
rode,
feeling
their
way
up
the
twisting
pass
and
through
the
stretches
of
broken
ground.
The
wind
grew
stronger.
Sometimes
it
was
so
dark
that
they
dismounted
and
went
ahead
on
foot,
each
man
leading
his
garron.
Once
Ebben
suggested
that
some
torches
might
serve
them
well,
but
Qhorin
said,
вЂњNo
fire,вЂќ
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.
They
reached
the
stone
bridge
at
the
summit
and
began
to
descend
again.
Off
in
the
darkness
a
shadowcat
screamed
in
fury,
its
voice
bouncing
off
the
rocks
so
it
seemed
as
though
a
dozen
other
вЂ™cats
were
giving
answer.
Once
Jon
thought
he
saw
a
pair
of
glowing
eyes
on
a
ledge
overhead,
as
big
as
harvest
moons.

In
the
black
hour
before
dawn,
they
stopped
to
let
the
horses
drink
and
fed
them
each
a
handful
of
oats
and
a
twist
or
two
of
hay.
вЂњWe
are
not
far
from
the
place
the
wildlings
died,вЂќ
said
Qhorin.
вЂњFrom
there,
one
man
could
hold
a
hundred.
The
right
man.вЂќ
He
looked
at
Squire
Dalbridge.

The
squire
bowed
his
head.
вЂњLeave
me
as
many
arrows
as
you
can
spare,
brothers.вЂќ
He
stroked
his
longbow.
вЂњAnd
see
my
garron
has
an
apple
when
youвЂ™re
home.
HeвЂ™s
earned
it,
poor
beastie.вЂќ

HeвЂ™s
staying
to
die,
Jon
realized.

Qhorin
clasped
the
squireвЂ™s
forearm
with
a
gloved
hand.
вЂњIf
the
eagle
flies
down
for
a
look
at
youвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњвЂ¦heвЂ™ll
sprout
some
new
feathers.вЂќ

The
last
Jon
saw
of
Squire
Dalbridge
was
his
back
as
he
clambered
up
the
narrow
path
to
the
heights.

When
dawn
broke,
Jon
looked
up
into
a
cloudless
sky
and
saw
a
speck
moving
through
the
blue.
Ebben
saw
it
too,
and
cursed,
but
Qhorin
told
him
to
be
quiet.
вЂњListen.вЂќ

Jon
held
his
breath,
and
heard
it.
Far
away
and
behind
them,
the
call
of
a
hunting
horn
echoed
against
the
mountains.

вЂњAnd
now
they
come,вЂќ
said
Qhorin.





TYRION

Pod
dressed
him
for
his
ordeal
in
a
plush
velvet
tunic
of
Lannister
crimson
and
brought
him
his
chain
of
office.
Tyrion
left
it
on
the
bedside
table.
His
sister
misliked
being
reminded
that
he
was
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand,
and
he
did
not
wish
to
inflame
the
relations
between
them
any
further.

Varys
caught
up
with
him
as
he
was
crossing
the
yard.
вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
he
said,
a
little
out
of
breath.
вЂњYou
had
best
read
this
at
once.вЂќ
He
held
out
a
parchment
in
a
soft
white
hand.
вЂњA
report
from
the
north.вЂќ

вЂњGood
news
or
bad?вЂќ
Tyrion
asked.

вЂњThat
is
not
for
me
to
judge.вЂќ

Tyrion
unrolled
the
parchment.
He
had
to
squint
to
read
the
words
in
the
torchlit
yard.
вЂњGods
be
good,вЂќ
he
said
softly.
вЂњBoth
of
them?вЂќ

вЂњI
fear
so,
my
lord.
It
is
so
sad.
So
grievous
sad.
And
them
so
young
and
innocent.вЂќ

Tyrion
remembered
how
the
wolves
had
howled
when
the
Stark
boy
had
fallen.
Are
they
howling
now,
I
wonder?
вЂњHave
you
told
anyone
else?вЂќ
he
asked.

вЂњNot
as
yet,
though
of
course
I
must.вЂќ

He
rolled
up
the
letter.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
tell
my
sister.вЂќ
He
wanted
to
see
how
she
took
the
news.
He
wanted
that
very
much.

The
queen
looked
especially
lovely
that
night.
She
wore
a
low-cut
gown
of
deep
green
velvet
that
brought
out
the
color
of
her
eyes.
Her
golden
hair
tumbled
across
her
bare
shoulders,
and
around
her
waist
was
a
woven
belt
studded
with
emeralds.
Tyrion
waited
until
he
had
been
seated
and
served
a
cup
of
wine
before
thrusting
the
letter
at
her.
He
said
not
a
word.
Cersei
blinked
at
him
innocently
and
took
the
parchment
from
his
hand.

вЂњI
trust
youвЂ™re
pleased,вЂќ
he
said
as
she
read.
вЂњYou
wanted
the
Stark
boy
dead,
I
believe.вЂќ

Cersei
made
a
sour
face.
вЂњIt
was
Jaime
who
threw
him
from
that
window,
not
me.
For
love,
he
said,
as
if
that
would
please
me.
It
was
a
stupid
thing
to
do,
and
dangerous
besides,
but
when
did
our
sweet
brother
ever
stop
to
think?вЂќ

вЂњThe
boy
saw
you,вЂќ
Tyrion
pointed
out.

вЂњHe
was
a
child.
I
could
have
frightened
him
into
silence.вЂќ
She
looked
at
the
letter
thoughtfully.
вЂњWhy
must
I
suffer
accusations
every
time
some
Stark
stubs
his
toe?
This
was
GreyjoyвЂ™s
work,
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.вЂќ

вЂњLet
us
hope
Lady
Catelyn
believes
that.вЂќ

Her
eyes
widened.
вЂњShe
wouldnвЂ™tвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”kill
Jaime?
Why
not?
What
would
you
do
if
Joffrey
and
Tommen
were
murdered?вЂќ

вЂњI
still
hold
Sansa!вЂќ
the
queen
declared.

вЂњWe
still
hold
Sansa,вЂќ
he
corrected
her,
вЂњand
we
had
best
take
good
care
of
her.
Now
where
is
this
supper
youвЂ™ve
promised
me,
sweet
sister?вЂќ

Cersei
set
a
tasty
table,
that
could
not
be
denied.
They
started
with
a
creamy
chestnut
soup,
crusty
hot
bread,
and
greens
dressed
with
apples
and
pine
nuts.
Then
came
lamprey
pie,
honeyed
ham,
buttered
carrots,
white
beans
and
bacon,
and
roast
swan
stuffed
with
mushrooms
and
oysters.
Tyrion
was
exceedingly
courteous;
he
offered
his
sister
the
choice
portions
of
every
dish,
and
made
certain
he
ate
only
what
she
did.
Not
that
he
truly
thought
sheвЂ™d
poison
him,
but
it
never
hurt
to
be
careful.

The
news
about
the
Starks
had
soured
her,
he
could
see.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
had
no
word
from
Bitterbridge?вЂќ
she
asked
anxiously
as
she
speared
a
bit
of
apple
on
the
point
of
her
dagger
and
ate
it
with
small,
delicate
bites.

вЂњNone.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve
never
trusted
Littlefinger.
For
enough
coin,
heвЂ™d
go
over
to
Stannis
in
a
heartbeat.вЂќ

вЂњStannis
Baratheon
is
too
bloody
righteous
to
buy
men.
Nor
would
he
make
a
comfortable
lord
for
the
likes
of
Petyr.
This
war
has
made
for
some
queer
bedfellows,
I
agree,
but
those
two?
No.вЂќ

As
he
carved
some
slices
off
the
ham,
she
said,
вЂњWe
have
Lady
Tanda
to
thank
for
the
pig.вЂќ

вЂњA
token
of
her
love?вЂќ

вЂњA
bribe.
She
begs
leave
to
return
to
her
castle.
Your
leave
as
well
as
mine.
I
suspect
she
fears
youвЂ™ll
arrest
her
on
the
road,
as
you
did
Lord
Gyles.вЂќ

вЂњDoes
she
plan
to
make
off
with
the
heir
to
the
throne?вЂќ
Tyrion
served
his
sister
a
cut
of
ham
and
took
one
for
himself.
вЂњIвЂ™d
sooner
she
remain.
If
she
wants
to
feel
safe,
tell
her
to
bring
down
her
garrison
from
Stokeworth.
As
many
men
as
she
has.вЂќ

вЂњIf
we
need
men
so
badly,
why
did
you
send
away
your
savages?вЂќ
A
certain
testiness
crept
into
CerseiвЂ™s
voice.

вЂњIt
was
the
best
use
I
could
have
made
of
them,вЂќ
he
told
her
truthfully.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
fierce
warriors,
but
not
soldiers.
In
formal
battle,
discipline
is
more
important
than
courage.
TheyвЂ™ve
already
done
us
more
good
in
the
kingswood
than
they
would
ever
have
done
us
on
the
city
walls.вЂќ

As
the
swan
was
being
served,
the
queen
questioned
him
about
the
conspiracy
of
the
Antler
Men.
She
seemed
more
annoyed
than
afraid.
вЂњWhy
are
we
plagued
with
so
many
treasons?
What
injury
has
House
Lannister
ever
done
these
wretches?вЂќ

вЂњNone,вЂќ
said
Tyrion,
вЂњbut
they
think
to
be
on
the
winning
sideвЂ¦
which
makes
them
fools
as
well
as
traitors.вЂќ

вЂњAre
you
certain
youвЂ™ve
found
them
all?вЂќ

вЂњVarys
says
so.вЂќ
The
swan
was
too
rich
for
his
taste.

A
line
appeared
on
CerseiвЂ™s
pale
white
brow,
between
those
lovely
eyes.
вЂњYou
put
too
much
trust
in
that
eunuch.вЂќ

вЂњHe
serves
me
well.вЂќ

вЂњOr
so
heвЂ™d
have
you
believe.
You
think
youвЂ™re
the
only
one
he
whispers
secrets
to?
He
gives
each
of
us
just
enough
to
convince
us
that
weвЂ™d
be
helpless
without
him.
He
played
the
same
game
with
me,
when
I
first
wed
Robert.
For
years,
I
was
convinced
I
had
no
truer
friend
at
court,
but
nowвЂ¦вЂќ
She
studied
his
face
for
a
moment.
вЂњHe
says
you
mean
to
take
the
Hound
from
Joffrey.вЂќ

Damn
Varys.
вЂњI
need
Clegane
for
more
important
duties.вЂќ

вЂњNothing
is
more
important
than
the
life
of
the
king.вЂќ

вЂњThe
life
of
the
king
is
not
at
risk.
Joff
will
have
brave
Ser
Osmund
guarding
him,
and
Meryn
Trant
as
well.вЂќ
TheyвЂ™re
good
for
nothing
better.
вЂњI
need
Balon
Swann
and
the
Hound
to
lead
sorties,
to
make
certain
Stannis
gets
no
toehold
on
our
side
of
the
Blackwater.вЂќ

вЂњJaime
would
lead
the
sorties
himself.вЂќ

вЂњFrom
Riverrun?
ThatвЂ™s
quite
a
sortie.вЂќ

вЂњJoffвЂ™s
only
a
boy.вЂќ

вЂњA
boy
who
wants
to
be
part
of
this
battle,
and
for
once
heвЂ™s
showing
some
sense.
I
donвЂ™t
intend
to
put
him
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting,
but
he
needs
to
be
seen.
Men
fight
more
fiercely
for
a
king
who
shares
their
peril
than
one
who
hides
behind
his
motherвЂ™s
skirts.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
thirteen,
Tyrion.вЂќ

вЂњRemember
Jaime
at
thirteen?
If
you
want
the
boy
to
be
his
fatherвЂ™s
son,
let
him
play
the
part.
Joff
wears
the
finest
armor
gold
can
buy,
and
heвЂ™ll
have
a
dozen
gold
cloaks
around
him
at
all
times.
If
the
city
looks
to
be
in
the
least
danger
of
falling,
IвЂ™ll
have
him
escorted
back
to
the
Red
Keep
at
once.вЂќ

He
had
thought
that
might
reassure
her,
but
he
saw
no
sign
of
pleasure
in
those
green
eyes.
вЂњWill
the
city
fall?вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
But
if
it
does,
pray
that
we
can
hold
the
Red
Keep
long
enough
for
our
lord
father
to
march
to
our
relief.

вЂњYouвЂ™ve
lied
to
me
before,
Tyrion.вЂќ

вЂњAlways
with
good
reason,
sweet
sister.
I
want
amity
between
us
as
much
as
you
do.
IвЂ™ve
decided
to
release
Lord
Gyles.вЂќ
He
had
kept
Gyles
safe
for
just
this
gesture.
вЂњYou
can
have
Ser
Boros
Blount
back
as
well.вЂќ

The
queenвЂ™s
mouth
tightened.
вЂњSer
Boros
can
rot
at
Rosby,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњbut
TommenвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”stays
where
he
is.
HeвЂ™s
safer
under
Lord
JacelynвЂ™s
protection
than
he
would
ever
have
been
with
Lord
Gyles.вЂќ

Serving
men
cleared
away
the
swan,
hardly
touched.
Cersei
beckoned
for
the
sweet.
вЂњI
hope
you
like
blackberry
tarts.вЂќ

вЂњI
love
all
sorts
of
tarts.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
IвЂ™ve
known
that
a
long
while.
Do
you
know
why
Varys
is
so
dangerous?вЂќ

вЂњAre
we
playing
at
riddles
now?
No.вЂќ

вЂњHe
doesnвЂ™t
have
a
cock.вЂќ

вЂњNeither
do
you.вЂќ
And
donвЂ™t
you
just
hate
that,
Cersei?

вЂњPerhaps
IвЂ™m
dangerous
too.
You,
on
the
other
hand,
are
as
big
a
fool
as
every
other
man.
That
worm
between
your
legs
does
half
your
thinking.вЂќ

Tyrion
licked
the
crumbs
off
his
fingers.
He
did
not
like
his
sisterвЂ™s
smile.
вЂњYes,
and
just
now
my
worm
is
thinking
that
perhaps
it
is
time
I
took
my
leave.вЂќ

вЂњAre
you
unwell,
brother?вЂќ
She
leaned
forward,
giving
him
a
good
look
at
the
top
of
her
breasts.
вЂњSuddenly
you
appear
somewhat
flustered.вЂќ

вЂњFlustered?вЂќ
Tyrion
glanced
at
the
door.
He
thought
heвЂ™d
heard
something
outside.
He
was
beginning
to
regret
coming
here
alone.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
never
shown
much
interest
in
my
cock
before.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
not
your
cock
that
interests
me,
so
much
as
what
you
stick
it
in.
I
donвЂ™t
depend
on
the
eunuch
for
everything,
as
you
do.
I
have
my
own
ways
of
finding
out
thingsвЂ¦
especially
things
that
people
donвЂ™t
want
me
to
know.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
are
you
trying
to
say?вЂќ

вЂњOnly
thisвЂ”I
have
your
little
whore.вЂќ

Tyrion
reached
for
his
wine
cup,
buying
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts.
вЂњI
thought
men
were
more
to
your
taste.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™re
such
a
droll
little
fellow.
Tell
me,
have
you
married
this
one
yet?вЂќ
When
he
gave
her
no
answer
she
laughed
and
said,
вЂњFather
will
be
ever
so
relieved.вЂќ

His
belly
felt
as
if
it
were
full
of
eels.
How
had
she
found
Shae?
Had
Varys
betrayed
him?
Or
had
all
his
precautions
been
undone
by
his
impatience
the
night
he
rode
directly
to
the
manse?
вЂњWhy
should
you
care
who
I
choose
to
warm
my
bed?вЂќ

вЂњA
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњYouвЂ™ve
been
scheming
against
me
since
the
day
you
came
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
You
sold
Myrcella,
stole
Tommen,
and
now
you
plot
to
have
Joff
killed.
You
want
him
dead
so
you
can
rule
through
Tommen.вЂќ

Well,
I
canвЂ™t
say
the
notion
isnвЂ™t
tempting.
вЂњThis
is
madness,
Cersei.
Stannis
will
be
here
in
days.
You
need
me.вЂќ

вЂњFor
what?
Your
great
prowess
in
battle?вЂќ

вЂњBronnвЂ™s
sellswords
will
never
fight
without
me,вЂќ
he
lied.

вЂњOh,
I
think
they
will.
ItвЂ™s
your
gold
they
love,
not
your
impish
wit.
Have
no
fear,
though,
they
wonвЂ™t
be
without
you.
I
wonвЂ™t
say
I
havenвЂ™t
thought
of
slitting
your
throat
from
time
to
time,
but
Jaime
would
never
forgive
me
if
I
did.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
whore?вЂќ
He
would
not
call
her
by
name.
If
I
can
convince
her
Shae
means
nothing
to
me,
perhapsвЂ¦

вЂњSheвЂ™ll
be
treated
gently
enough,
so
long
as
no
harm
comes
to
my
sons.
If
Joff
should
be
killed,
however,
or
if
Tommen
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies,
your
little
cunt
will
die
more
painfully
than
you
can
possibly
imagine.вЂќ

She
truly
believes
I
mean
to
kill
my
own
nephew.
вЂњThe
boys
are
safe,вЂќ
he
promised
her
wearily.
вЂњGods
be
good,
Cersei,
theyвЂ™re
my
own
blood!
What
sort
of
man
do
you
take
me
for?вЂќ

вЂњA
small
and
twisted
one.вЂќ

Tyrion
stared
at
the
dregs
on
the
bottom
of
his
wine
cup.
What
would
Jaime
do
in
my
place?
Kill
the
bitch,
most
likely,
and
worry
about
the
consequences
afterward.
But
Tyrion
did
not
have
a
golden
sword,
nor
the
skill
to
wield
one.
He
loved
his
brotherвЂ™s
reckless
wrath,
but
it
was
their
lord
father
he
must
try
and
emulate.
Stone,
I
must
be
stone,
I
must
be
Casterly
Rock,
hard
and
unmovable.
If
I
fail
this
test,
I
had
as
lief
seek
out
the
nearest
grotesquerie.
вЂњFor
all
I
know,
youвЂ™ve
killed
her
already,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњWould
you
like
to
see
her?
I
thought
you
might.вЂќ
Cersei
crossed
the
room
and
threw
open
the
heavy
oaken
door.
вЂњBring
in
my
brotherвЂ™s
whore.вЂќ

Ser
OsmundвЂ™s
brothers
Osney
and
Osfryd
were
peas
from
the
same
pod,
tall
men
with
hooked
noses,
dark
hair,
and
cruel
smiles.
She
hung
between
them,
eyes
wide
and
white
in
her
dark
face.
Blood
trickled
from
her
broken
lip,
and
he
could
see
bruises
through
her
torn
clothing.
Her
hands
were
bound
with
rope,
and
theyвЂ™d
gagged
her
so
she
could
not
speak.

вЂњYou
said
she
wouldnвЂ™t
be
hurt.вЂќ

вЂњShe
fought.вЂќ
Unlike
his
brothers,
Osney
Kettleblack
was
clean-shaven,
so
the
scratches
showed
plainly
on
his
bare
cheeks.
вЂњGot
claws
like
a
shadowcat,
this
one.вЂќ

вЂњBruises
heal,вЂќ
said
Cersei
in
a
bored
tone.
вЂњThe
whore
will
live.
So
long
as
Joff
does.вЂќ

Tyrion
wanted
to
laugh
at
her.
It
would
have
been
so
sweet,
so
very
very
sweet,
but
it
would
have
given
the
game
away.
YouвЂ™ve
lost,
Cersei,
and
the
Kettleblacks
are
even
bigger
fools
than
Bronn
claimed.
All
he
needed
to
do
was
say
the
words.

Instead
he
looked
at
the
girlвЂ™s
face
and
said,
вЂњYou
swear
youвЂ™ll
release
her
after
the
battle?вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
release
Tommen,
yes.вЂќ

He
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
вЂњKeep
her
then,
but
keep
her
safe.
If
these
animals
think
they
can
use
herвЂ¦
well,
sweet
sister,
let
me
point
out
that
a
scale
tips
two
ways.вЂќ
His
tone
was
calm,
flat,
uncaring;
heвЂ™d
reached
for
his
fatherвЂ™s
voice,
and
found
it.
вЂњWhatever
happens
to
her
happens
to
Tommen
as
well,
and
that
includes
the
beatings
and
rapes.вЂќ
If
she
thinks
me
such
a
monster,
IвЂ™ll
play
the
part
for
her.

Cersei
had
not
expected
that.
вЂњYou
would
not
dare.вЂќ

Tyrion
made
himself
smile,
slow
and
cold.
Green
and
black,
his
eyes
laughed
at
her.
вЂњDare?
IвЂ™ll
do
it
myself.вЂќ

His
sisterвЂ™s
hand
flashed
at
his
face,
but
he
caught
her
wrist
and
bent
it
back
until
she
cried
out.
Osfryd
moved
to
her
rescue.
вЂњOne
more
step
and
IвЂ™ll
break
her
arm,вЂќ
the
dwarf
warned
him.
The
man
stopped.
вЂњYou
remember
when
I
said
youвЂ™d
never
hit
me
again,
Cersei?вЂќ
He
shoved
her
to
the
floor
and
turned
back
to
the
Kettleblacks.
вЂњUntie
her
and
remove
that
gag.вЂќ

The
rope
had
been
so
tight
as
to
cut
off
the
blood
to
her
hands.
She
cried
out
in
pain
as
the
circulation
returned.
Tyrion
massaged
her
fingers
gently
until
feeling
returned.
вЂњSweetling,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњyou
must
be
brave.
I
am
sorry
they
hurt
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
youвЂ™ll
free
me,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњI
will,вЂќ
he
promised,
and
Alayaya
bent
over
and
kissed
him
on
the
brow.
Her
broken
lips
left
a
smear
of
blood
on
his
forehead.
A
bloody
kiss
is
more
than
I
deserve,
Tyrion
thought.
She
would
never
have
been
hurt
but
for
me.

Her
blood
still
marked
him
as
he
looked
down
at
the
queen.
вЂњI
have
never
liked
you,
Cersei,
but
you
were
my
own
sister,
so
I
never
did
you
harm.
YouвЂ™ve
ended
that.
I
will
hurt
you
for
this.
I
donвЂ™t
know
how
yet,
but
give
me
time.
A
day
will
come
when
you
think
yourself
safe
and
happy,
and
suddenly
your
joy
will
turn
to
ashes
in
your
mouth,
and
youвЂ™ll
know
the
debt
is
paid.вЂќ
In
war,
his
father
had
told
him
once,
the
battle
is
over
in
the
instant
one
army
breaks
and
flees.
No
matter
that
theyвЂ™re
as
numerous
as
they
were
a
moment
before,
still
armed
and
armored;
once
they
had
run
before
you
they
would
not
turn
to
fight
again.
So
it
was
with
Cersei.
вЂњGet
out!вЂќ
was
all
the
answer
she
could
summon.
вЂњGet
out
of
my
sight!вЂќ

Tyrion
bowed.
вЂњGood
night,
then.
And
pleasant
dreams.вЂќ

He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
with
a
thousand
armored
feet
marching
through
his
skull.
I
ought
to
have
seen
this
coming
the
first
time
I
slipped
through
the
back
of
ChatayaвЂ™s
wardrobe.
Perhaps
he
had
not
wanted
to
see.
His
legs
were
aching
badly
by
the
time
he
had
made
the
climb.
He
sent
Pod
for
a
flagon
of
wine
and
pushed
his
way
into
his
bedchamber.

Shae
sat
cross-legged
in
the
canopied
bed,
nude
but
for
the
heavy
golden
chain
that
looped
across
the
swell
of
her
breasts:
a
chain
of
linked
golden
hands,
each
clasping
the
next.

Tyrion
had
not
expected
her.
вЂњWhat
are
you
doing
here?вЂќ

Laughing,
she
stroked
the
chain.
вЂњI
wanted
some
hands
on
my
tittiesвЂ¦
but
these
little
gold
ones
are
cold.вЂќ

For
a
moment
he
did
know
what
to
say.
How
could
he
tell
her
that
another
woman
had
taken
the
beating
meant
for
her,
and
might
well
die
in
her
place
should
some
mischance
of
battle
fell
Joffrey?
He
wiped
AlayayaвЂ™s
blood
from
his
brow
with
the
heel
of
his
hand.
вЂњThe
Lady
LollysвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSheвЂ™s
asleep.
SleepвЂ™s
all
she
ever
wants
to
do,
the
great
cow.
She
sleeps
and
she
eats.
Sometimes
she
falls
asleep
while
sheвЂ™s
eating.
The
food
falls
under
the
blankets
and
she
rolls
in
it,
and
I
have
to
clean
her.вЂќ
She
made
a
disgusted
face.
вЂњAll
they
did
was
fuck
her.вЂќ

вЂњHer
mother
says
sheвЂ™s
sick.вЂќ

вЂњShe
has
a
baby
in
her
belly,
thatвЂ™s
all.вЂќ

Tyrion
gazed
around
the
room.
Everything
seemed
much
as
he
left
it.
вЂњHow
did
you
enter?
Show
me
the
hidden
door.вЂќ

She
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњLord
Varys
made
me
wear
a
hood.
I
couldnвЂ™t
see,
exceptвЂ¦
there
was
one
place,
I
got
a
peep
at
the
floor
out
the
bottom
of
the
hood.
It
was
all
tiles,
you
know,
the
kind
that
make
a
picture?вЂќ

вЂњA
mosaic?вЂќ

Shae
nodded.
вЂњThey
were
colored
red
and
black.
I
think
the
picture
was
a
dragon.
Otherwise,
everything
was
dark.
We
went
down
a
ladder
and
walked
a
long
ways,
until
I
was
all
twisted
around.
Once
we
stopped
so
he
could
unlock
an
iron
gate.
I
brushed
against
it
when
we
went
through.
The
dragon
was
past
the
gate.
Then
we
went
up
another
ladder,
with
a
tunnel
at
the
top.
I
had
to
stoop,
and
I
think
Lord
Varys
was
crawling.вЂќ

Tyrion
made
a
round
of
the
bedchamber.
One
of
the
sconces
looked
loose.
He
stood
on
his
toes
and
tried
to
turn
it.
It
revolved
slowly,
scraping
against
the
stone
wall.
When
it
was
upside
down,
the
stub
of
the
candle
fell
out.
The
rushes
scattered
across
the
cold
stone
floor
did
not
show
any
particular
disturbance.
вЂњDoesnвЂ™t
mвЂ™lord
want
to
bed
me?вЂќ
asked
Shae.

вЂњIn
a
moment.вЂќ
Tyrion
threw
open
his
wardrobe,
shoved
the
clothing
aside,
and
pushed
against
the
rear
panel.
What
worked
for
a
whorehouse
might
work
for
a
castle
as
wellвЂ¦
but
no,
the
wood
was
solid,
unyielding.
A
stone
beside
the
window
seat
drew
his
eye,
but
all
his
tugging
and
prodding
went
for
naught.
He
returned
to
the
bed
frustrated
and
annoyed.

Shae
undid
his
laces
and
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck.
вЂњYour
shoulders
feel
as
hard
as
rocks,вЂќ
she
murmured.
вЂњHurry,
I
want
to
feel
you
inside
me.вЂќ
Yet
as
her
legs
locked
around
his
waist,
his
manhood
left
him.
When
she
felt
him
go
soft,
Shae
slid
down
under
the
sheets
and
took
him
in
her
mouth,
but
even
that
could
not
rouse
him.

After
a
few
moments
he
stopped
her.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
wrong?вЂќ
she
asked.
All
the
sweet
innocence
of
the
world
was
written
there
in
the
lines
of
her
young
face.

Innocence?
Fool,
sheвЂ™s
a
whore,
Cersei
was
right,
you
think
with
your
cock,
fool,
fool.

вЂњJust
go
to
sleep,
sweetling,вЂќ
he
urged,
stroking
her
hair.
Yet
long
after
Shae
had
taken
his
advice,
Tyrion
himself
still
lay
awake,
his
fingers
cupped
over
one
small
breast
as
he
listened
to
her
breathing.





CATELYN

The
Great
Hall
of
Riverrun
was
a
lonely
place
for
two
to
sit
to
supper.
Deep
shadows
draped
the
walls.
One
of
the
torches
had
guttered
out,
leaving
only
three.
Catelyn
sat
staring
into
her
wine
goblet.
The
vintage
tasted
thin
and
sour
on
her
tongue.
Brienne
was
across
from
her.
Between
them,
her
fatherвЂ™s
high
seat
was
as
empty
as
the
rest
of
the
hall.
Even
the
servants
were
gone.
She
had
given
them
leave
to
join
the
celebration.

The
walls
of
the
keep
were
thick,
yet
even
so,
they
could
hear
the
muffled
sounds
of
revelry
from
the
yard
outside.
Ser
Desmond
had
brought
twenty
casks
up
from
the
cellars,
and
the
smallfolk
were
celebrating
EdmureвЂ™s
imminent
return
and
RobbвЂ™s
conquest
of
the
Crag
by
hoisting
horns
of
nut-brown
ale.

I
cannot
blame
them,
Catelyn
thought.
They
do
not
know.
And
if
they
did,
why
should
they
care?
They
never
knew
my
sons.
Never
watched
Bran
climb
with
their
hearts
in
their
throats,
pride
and
terror
so
mingled
they
seemed
as
one,
never
heard
him
laugh,
never
smiled
to
see
Rickon
trying
so
fiercely
to
be
like
his
older
brothers.
She
stared
at
the
supper
set
before
her:
trout
wrapped
in
bacon,
salad
of
turnip
greens
and
red
fennel
and
sweetgrass,
pease
and
onions
and
hot
bread.
Brienne
was
eating
methodically,
as
if
supper
were
another
chore
to
be
accomplished.
I
am
become
a
sour
woman,
Catelyn
thought.
I
take
no
joy
in
mead
nor
meat,
and
song
and
laughter
have
become
suspicious
strangers
to
me.
I
am
a
creature
of
grief
and
dust
and
bitter
longings.
There
is
an
empty
place
within
me
where
my
heart
was
once.

The
sound
of
the
other
womanвЂ™s
eating
had
become
intolerable
to
her.
вЂњBrienne,
I
am
no
fit
company.
Go
join
the
revels,
if
you
would.
Drink
a
horn
of
ale
and
dance
to
RymundвЂ™s
harping.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
not
made
for
revels,
my
lady.вЂќ
Her
big
hands
tore
apart
a
heel
of
black
bread.
Brienne
stared
at
the
chunks
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
they
were.
вЂњIf
you
command
it,
IвЂ¦вЂќ

Catelyn
could
sense
her
discomfort.
вЂњI
only
thought
you
might
enjoy
happier
company
than
mine.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
well
content.вЂќ
The
girl
used
the
bread
to
sop
up
some
of
the
bacon
grease
the
trout
had
been
fried
in.

вЂњThere
was
another
bird
this
morning.вЂќ
Catelyn
did
not
know
why
she
said
it.
вЂњThe
maester
woke
me
at
once.
That
was
dutiful,
but
not
kind.
Not
kind
at
all.вЂќ
She
had
not
meant
to
tell
Brienne.
No
one
knew
but
her
and
Maester
Vyman,
and
she
had
meant
to
keep
it
that
way
untilвЂ¦
untilвЂ¦

Until
what?
Foolish
woman,
will
holding
it
secret
in
your
heart
make
it
any
less
true?
If
you
never
tell,
never
speak
of
it,
will
it
become
only
a
dream,
less
than
a
dream,
a
nightmare
half-remembered?
Oh,
if
only
the
gods
would
be
so
good.

вЂњIs
it
news
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing?вЂќ
asked
Brienne.

вЂњWould
that
it
was.
The
bird
came
from
Castle
Cerwyn,
from
Ser
Rodrik,
my
castellan.вЂќ
Dark
wings,
dark
words.
вЂњHe
has
gathered
what
power
he
could
and
is
marching
on
Winterfell,
to
take
the
castle
back.вЂќ
How
unimportant
all
that
sounded
now.
вЂњBut
he
saidвЂ¦
he
wroteвЂ¦
he
told
me,
heвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњMy
lady,
what
is
it?
Is
it
some
news
of
your
sons?вЂќ

Such
a
simple
question
that
was;
would
that
the
answer
could
be
as
simple.
When
Catelyn
tried
to
speak,
the
words
caught
in
her
throat.
вЂњI
have
no
sons
but
Robb.вЂќ
She
managed
those
terrible
words
without
a
sob,
and
for
that
much
she
was
glad.

Brienne
looked
at
her
with
horror.
вЂњMy
lady?вЂќ

вЂњBran
and
Rickon
tried
to
escape,
but
were
taken
at
a
mill
on
the
Acorn
Water.
Theon
Greyjoy
has
mounted
their
heads
on
the
walls
of
Winterfell.
Theon
Greyjoy,
who
ate
at
my
table
since
he
was
a
boy
of
ten.вЂќ
I
have
said
it,
gods
forgive
me.
I
have
said
it
and
made
it
true.

BrienneвЂ™s
face
was
a
watery
blur.
She
reached
across
the
table,
but
her
fingers
stopped
short
of
CatelynвЂ™s,
as
if
the
touch
might
be
unwelcome.
вЂњIвЂ¦
there
are
no
words,
my
lady.
My
good
lady.
Your
sons,
theyвЂ¦
theyвЂ™re
with
the
gods
now.вЂќ

вЂњAre
they?вЂќ
Catelyn
said
sharply.
вЂњWhat
god
would
let
this
happen?
Rickon
was
only
a
baby.
How
could
he
deserve
such
a
death?
And
BranвЂ¦
when
I
left
the
north,
he
had
not
opened
his
eyes
since
his
fall.
I
had
to
go
before
he
woke.
Now
I
can
never
return
to
him,
or
hear
him
laugh
again.вЂќ
She
showed
Brienne
her
palms,
her
fingers.
вЂњThese
scarsвЂ¦
they
sent
a
man
to
cut
BranвЂ™s
throat
as
he
lay
sleeping.
He
would
have
died
then,
and
me
with
him,
but
BranвЂ™s
wolf
tore
out
the
manвЂ™s
throat.вЂќ
That
gave
her
a
momentвЂ™s
pause.
вЂњI
suppose
Theon
killed
the
wolves
too.
He
must
have,
elsewiseвЂ¦
I
was
certain
the
boys
would
be
safe
so
long
as
the
direwolves
were
with
them.
Like
Robb
with
his
Grey
Wind.
But
my
daughters
have
no
wolves
now.вЂќ

The
abrupt
shift
of
topic
left
Brienne
bewildered.
вЂњYour
daughtersвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSansa
was
a
lady
at
three,
always
so
courteous
and
eager
to
please.
She
loved
nothing
so
well
as
tales
of
knightly
valor.
Men
would
say
she
had
my
look,
but
she
will
grow
into
a
woman
far
more
beautiful
than
I
ever
was,
you
can
see
that.
I
often
sent
away
her
maid
so
I
could
brush
her
hair
myself.
She
had
auburn
hair,
lighter
than
mine,
and
so
thick
and
softвЂ¦
the
red
in
it
would
catch
the
light
of
the
torches
and
shine
like
copper.

вЂњAnd
Arya,
wellвЂ¦
NedвЂ™s
visitors
would
oft
mistake
her
for
a
stableboy
if
they
rode
into
the
yard
unannounced.
Arya
was
a
trial,
it
must
be
said.
Half
a
boy
and
half
a
wolf
pup.
Forbid
her
anything
and
it
became
her
heartвЂ™s
desire.
She
had
NedвЂ™s
long
face,
and
brown
hair
that
always
looked
as
though
a
bird
had
been
nesting
in
it.
I
despaired
of
ever
making
a
lady
of
her.
She
collected
scabs
as
other
girls
collect
dolls,
and
would
say
anything
that
came
into
her
head.
I
think
she
must
be
dead
too.вЂќ
When
she
said
that,
it
felt
as
though
a
giant
hand
were
squeezing
her
chest.
вЂњI
want
them
all
dead,
Brienne.
Theon
Greyjoy
first,
then
Jaime
Lannister
and
Cersei
and
the
Imp,
every
one,
every
one.
But
my
girlsвЂ¦
my
girls
willвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThe
queenвЂ¦
she
has
a
little
girl
of
her
own,вЂќ
Brienne
said
awkwardly.
вЂњAnd
sons
too,
of
an
age
with
yours.
When
she
hears,
perhaps
sheвЂ¦
she
may
take
pity,
andвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњSend
my
daughters
back
unharmed?вЂќ
Catelyn
smiled
sadly.
вЂњThere
is
a
sweet
innocence
about
you,
child.
I
could
wishвЂ¦
but
no.
Robb
will
avenge
his
brothers.
Ice
can
kill
as
dead
as
fire.
Ice
was
NedвЂ™s
greatsword.
Valyrian
steel,
marked
with
the
ripples
of
a
thousand
foldings,
so
sharp
I
feared
to
touch
it.
RobbвЂ™s
blade
is
dull
as
a
cudgel
compared
to
Ice.
It
will
not
be
easy
for
him
to
get
TheonвЂ™s
head
off,
I
fear.
The
Starks
do
not
use
headsmen.
Ned
always
said
that
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
blade,
though
he
never
took
any
joy
in
the
duty.
But
I
would,
oh,
yes.вЂќ
She
stared
at
her
scarred
hands,
opened
and
closed
them,
then
slowly
raised
her
eyes.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
sent
him
wine.вЂќ

вЂњWine?вЂќ
Brienne
was
lost.
вЂњRobb?
OrвЂ¦
Theon
Greyjoy?вЂќ

вЂњThe
Kingslayer.вЂќ
The
ploy
had
served
her
well
with
Cleos
Frey.
I
hope
youвЂ™re
thirsty,
Jaime.
I
hope
your
throat
is
dry
and
tight.
вЂњI
would
like
you
to
come
with
me.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
yours
to
command,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњGood.вЂќ
Catelyn
rose
abruptly.
вЂњStay,
finish
your
meal
in
peace.
I
will
send
for
you
later.
At
midnight.вЂќ

вЂњSo
late,
my
lady?вЂќ

вЂњThe
dungeons
are
windowless.
One
hour
is
much
like
another
down
there,
and
for
me,
all
hours
are
midnight.вЂќ
Her
footsteps
rang
hollowly
when
Catelyn
left
the
hall.
As
she
climbed
to
Lord
HosterвЂ™s
solar,
she
could
hear
them
outside,
shouting,
вЂњTully!вЂќ
and
вЂњA
cup!
A
cup
to
the
brave
young
lord!вЂќ
My
father
is
not
dead,
she
wanted
to
shout
down
at
them.
My
sons
are
dead,
but
my
father
lives,
damn
you
all,
and
he
is
your
lord
still.

Lord
Hoster
was
deep
in
sleep.
вЂњHe
had
a
cup
of
drearnwine
not
so
long
ago,
my
lady,вЂќ
Maester
Vyman
said.
вЂњFor
the
pain.
He
will
not
know
you
are
here.вЂќ

вЂњIt
makes
no
matter,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
He
is
more
dead
than
alive,
yet
more
alive
than
my
poor
sweet
sons.

вЂњMy
lady,
is
there
aught
I
might
do
for
you?
A
sleeping
draught,
perhaps?вЂќ

вЂњThank
you,
Maester,
but
no.
I
will
not
sleep
away
my
grief.
Bran
and
Rickon
deserve
better
from
me.
Go
and
join
the
celebration,
I
will
sit
with
my
father
for
a
time.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will,
my
lady.вЂќ
Vyman
bowed
and
left
her.

Lord
Hoster
lay
on
his
back,
mouth
open,
his
breath
a
faint
whistling
sigh.
One
hand
hung
over
the
edge
of
the
mattress,
a
pale
frail
fleshless
thing,
but
warm
when
she
touched
it.
She
slid
her
fingers
through
his
and
closed
them.
No
matter
how
tightly
I
hold
him,
I
cannot
keep
him
here,
she
thought
sadly.
Let
him
go.
Yet
her
fingers
would
not
seem
to
unbend.

вЂњI
have
no
one
to
talk
with,
Father,вЂќ
she
told
him.
вЂњI
pray,
but
the
gods
do
not
answer.вЂќ
Lightly
she
kissed
his
hand.
The
skin
was
warm,
blue
veins
branching
like
rivers
beneath
his
pale
translucent
skin.
Outside
the
greater
rivers
flowed,
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone,
and
they
would
flow
forever,
but
not
so
the
rivers
in
her
fatherвЂ™s
hand.
Too
soon
that
current
would
grow
still.
вЂњLast
night
I
dreamed
of
that
time
Lysa
and
I
got
lost
while
riding
back
from
Seagard.
Do
you
remember?
That
strange
fog
came
up
and
we
fell
behind
the
rest
of
the
party.
Everything
was
grey,
and
I
could
not
see
a
foot
past
the
nose
of
my
horse.
We
lost
the
road.
The
branches
of
the
trees
were
like
long
skinny
arms
reaching
out
to
grab
us
as
we
passed.
Lysa
started
to
cry,
and
when
I
shouted
the
fog
seemed
to
swallow
the
sound.
But
Petyr
knew
where
we
were,
and
he
rode
back
and
found
usвЂ¦

вЂњBut
thereвЂ™s
no
one
to
find
me
now,
is
there?
This
time
I
have
to
find
our
own
way,
and
it
is
hard,
so
hard.

вЂњI
keep
remembering
the
Stark
words.
Winter
has
come,
Father.
For
me.
For
me.
Robb
must
fight
the
Greyjoys
now
as
well
as
the
Lannisters,
and
for
what?
For
a
gold
hat
and
an
iron
chair?
Surely
the
land
has
bled
enough.
I
want
my
girls
back,
I
want
Robb
to
lay
down
his
sword
and
pick
some
homely
daughter
of
Walder
Frey
to
make
him
happy
and
give
him
sons.
I
want
Bran
and
Rickon
back,
I
wantвЂ¦вЂќ
Catelyn
hung
her
head.
вЂњI
want,вЂќ
she
said
once
more,
and
then
her
words
were
gone.

After
a
time
the
candle
guttered
and
went
out.
Moonlight
slanted
between
the
slats
of
the
shutters,
laying
pale
silvery
bars
across
her
fatherвЂ™s
face.
She
could
hear
the
soft
whisper
of
his
labored
breathing,
the
endless
rush
of
waters,
the
faint
chords
of
some
love
song
drifting
up
from
the
yard,
so
sad
and
sweet.
вЂњI
loved
a
maid
as
red
as
autumn,вЂќ
Rymund
sang,
вЂњwith
sunset
in
her
hair.вЂќ

Catelyn
never
noticed
when
the
singing
ended.
Hours
had
passed,
yet
it
seemed
only
a
heartbeat
before
Brienne
was
at
the
door.
вЂњMy
lady,вЂќ
she
announced
softly.
вЂњMidnight
has
come.вЂќ

Midnight
has
come,
Father,
she
thought,
and
I
must
do
my
duty.
She
let
go
of
his
hand.

The
gaoler
was
a
furtive
little
man
with
broken
veins
in
his
nose.
They
found
him
bent
over
a
tankard
of
ale
and
the
remains
of
a
pigeon
pie,
more
than
a
little
drunk.
He
squinted
at
them
suspiciously.
вЂњBegging
your
forgiveness,
mвЂ™lady,
but
Lord
Edmure
says
no
one
is
to
see
the
Kingslayer
without
a
writing
from
him,
with
his
seal
upon
it.вЂќ

вЂњLord
Edmure?
Has
my
father
died,
and
no
one
told
me?вЂќ

The
gaoler
licked
his
lips.
вЂњNo,
mвЂ™lady,
not
as
I
knows.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will
open
the
cell,
or
you
will
come
with
me
to
Lord
HosterвЂ™s
solar
and
tell
him
why
you
saw
fit
to
defy
me.вЂќ

His
eyes
fell.
вЂњAs
mвЂ™lady
says.вЂќ
The
keys
were
chained
to
the
studded
leather
belt
that
girdled
his
waist.
He
muttered
under
his
breath
as
he
sorted
through
them,
until
he
found
the
one
that
fit
the
door
to
the
KingslayerвЂ™s
cell.

вЂњGo
back
to
your
ale
and
leave
us,вЂќ
she
commanded.
An
oil
lamp
hung
from
a
hook
on
the
low
ceiling.
Catelyn
took
it
down
and
turned
up
the
flame.
вЂњBrienne,
see
that
I
am
not
disturbed.вЂќ

Nodding,
Brienne
took
up
a
position
just
outside
the
cell,
her
hand
resting
on
the
pommel
of
her
sword.
вЂњMy
lady
will
call
if
she
has
need
of
me.вЂќ

Catelyn
shouldered
aside
the
heavy
wood-and-iron
door
and
stepped
into
foul
darkness.
This
was
the
bowels
of
Riverrun,
and
smelled
the
part.
Old
straw
crackled
underfoot.
The
walls
were
discolored
with
patches
of
nitre.
Through
the
stone,
she
could
hear
the
faint
rush
of
the
Tumblestone.
The
lamplight
revealed
a
pail
overflowing
with
feces
in
one
corner
and
a
huddled
shape
in
another.
The
flagon
of
wine
stood
beside
the
door,
untouched.
So
much
for
that
ploy.
I
ought
to
be
thankful
that
the
gaoler
did
not
drink
it
himself,
I
suppose.

Jaime
raised
his
hands
to
cover
his
face,
the
chains
around
his
wrists
clanking.
вЂњLady
Stark,вЂќ
he
said,
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
disuse.
вЂњI
fear
I
am
in
no
condition
to
receive
you.вЂќ

вЂњLook
at
me,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњThe
light
hurts
my
eyes.
A
moment,
if
you
would.вЂќ
Jaime
Lannister
had
been
allowed
no
razor
since
the
night
he
was
taken
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
a
shaggy
beard
covered
his
face,
once
so
like
the
queenвЂ™s.
Glinting
gold
in
the
lamplight,
the
whiskers
made
him
look
like
some
great
yellow
beast,
magnificent
even
in
chains.
His
unwashed
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders
in
ropes
and
tangles,
the
clothes
were
rotting
on
his
body,
his
face
was
pale
and
wastedвЂ¦
and
even
so,
the
power
and
the
beauty
of
the
man
were
still
apparent.

вЂњI
see
you
had
no
taste
for
the
wine
I
sent
you.вЂќ

вЂњSuch
sudden
generosity
seemed
somewhat
suspect.вЂќ

вЂњI
can
have
your
head
off
anytime
I
want.
Why
would
I
need
to
poison
you?вЂќ

вЂњDeath
by
poison
can
seem
natural.
Harder
to
claim
that
my
head
simply
fell
off.вЂќ
He
squinted
up
from
the
floor,
his
cat-green
eyes
slowly
becoming
accustomed
to
the
light.
вЂњIвЂ™d
invite
you
to
sit,
but
your
brother
has
neglected
to
provide
me
a
chair.вЂќ

вЂњI
can
stand
well
enough.вЂќ

вЂњCan
you?
You
look
terrible,
I
must
say.
Though
perhaps
itвЂ™s
just
the
light
in
here.вЂќ
He
was
fettered
at
wrist
and
ankle,
each
cuff
chained
to
the
others,
so
he
could
neither
stand
nor
lie
comfortably.
The
ankle
chains
were
bolted
to
the
wall.
вЂњAre
my
bracelets
heavy
enough
for
you,
or
did
you
come
to
add
a
few
more?
IвЂ™ll
rattle
them
prettily
if
you
like.вЂќ

вЂњYou
brought
this
on
yourself,вЂќ
she
reminded
him.
вЂњWe
granted
you
the
comfort
of
a
tower
cell
befitting
your
birth
and
station.
You
repaid
us
by
trying
to
escape.вЂќ

вЂњA
cell
is
a
cell.
Some
under
Casterly
Rock
make
this
one
seem
a
sunlit
garden.
One
day
perhaps
IвЂ™ll
show
them
to
you.вЂќ

If
he
is
cowed,
he
hides
it
well,
Catelyn
thought.
вЂњA
man
chained
hand
and
foot
should
keep
a
more
courteous
tongue
in
his
mouth,
ser.
I
did
not
come
here
to
be
threatened.вЂќ

вЂњNo?
Then
surely
it
was
to
have
your
pleasure
of
me?
ItвЂ™s
said
that
widows
grow
weary
of
their
empty
beds.
We
of
the
Kingsguard
vow
never
to
wed,
but
I
suppose
I
could
still
service
you
if
thatвЂ™s
what
you
need.
Pour
us
some
of
that
wine
and
slip
out
of
that
gown
and
weвЂ™ll
see
if
IвЂ™m
up
to
it.вЂќ

Catelyn
stared
down
at
him
in
revulsion.
Was
there
ever
a
man
as
beautiful
or
as
vile
as
this
one?
вЂњIf
you
said
that
in
my
sonвЂ™s
hearing,
he
would
kill
you
for
it.вЂќ

вЂњOnly
so
long
as
I
was
wearing
these.вЂќ
Jaime
Lannister
rattled
his
chains
at
her.
вЂњWe
both
know
the
boy
is
afraid
to
face
me
in
single
combat.вЂќ

вЂњMy
son
may
be
young,
but
if
you
take
him
for
a
fool,
you
are
sadly
mistakenвЂ¦
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
not
so
quick
to
make
challenges
when
you
had
an
army
at
your
back.вЂќ

вЂњDid
the
old
Kings
of
Winter
hide
behind
their
mothersвЂ™
skirts
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњI
grow
weary
of
this,
ser.
There
are
things
I
must
know.вЂќ

вЂњWhy
should
I
tell
you
anything?вЂќ

вЂњTo
save
your
life.вЂќ

вЂњYou
think
I
fear
death?вЂќ
That
seemed
to
amuse
him.

вЂњYou
should.
Your
crimes
will
have
earned
you
a
place
of
torment
in
the
deepest
of
the
seven
hells,
if
the
gods
are
just.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
gods
are
those,
Lady
Catelyn?
The
trees
your
husband
prayed
to?
How
well
did
they
serve
him
when
my
sister
took
his
head
off?вЂќ
Jaime
gave
a
chuckle.
вЂњIf
there
are
gods,
why
is
the
world
so
full
of
pain
and
injustice?вЂќ

вЂњBecause
of
men
like
you.вЂќ

вЂњThere
are
no
men
like
me.
ThereвЂ™s
only
me.вЂќ

There
is
nothing
here
but
arrogance
and
pride,
and
the
empty
courage
of
a
madman.
I
am
wasting
my
breath
with
this
one.
If
there
was
ever
a
spark
of
honor
in
him,
it
is
long
dead.
вЂњIf
you
will
not
speak
with
me,
so
be
it.
Drink
the
wine
or
piss
in
it,
ser,
it
makes
no
matter
to
me.вЂќ

Her
hand
was
at
the
door
pull
when
he
said,
вЂњLady
Stark.вЂќ
She
turned,
waited.
вЂњThings
go
to
rust
in
this
damp,вЂќ
Jaime
went
on.
вЂњEven
a
manвЂ™s
courtesies.
Stay,
and
you
shall
have
your
answersвЂ¦
for
a
price.вЂќ

He
has
no
shame.
вЂњCaptives
do
not
set
prices.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
youвЂ™ll
find
mine
modest
enough.
Your
turnkey
tells
me
nothing
but
vile
lies,
and
he
cannot
even
keep
them
straight.
One
day
he
says
Cersei
has
been
flayed,
and
the
next
itвЂ™s
my
father.
Answer
my
questions
and
IвЂ™ll
answer
yours.вЂќ

вЂњTruthfully?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
itвЂ™s
truth
you
want?
Be
careful,
my
lady.
Tyrion
says
that
people
often
claim
to
hunger
for
truth,
but
seldom
like
the
taste
when
itвЂ™s
served
up.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
strong
enough
to
hear
anything
you
care
to
say.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will,
then.
But
first,
if
youвЂ™d
be
so
kindвЂ¦
the
wine.
My
throat
is
raw.вЂќ

Catelyn
hung
the
lamp
from
the
door
and
moved
the
cup
and
flagon
closer.
Jaime
sloshed
the
wine
around
his
mouth
before
he
swallowed.
вЂњSour
and
vile,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњbut
it
will
do.вЂќ
He
put
his
back
to
the
wall,
drew
his
knees
up
to
his
chest,
and
stared
at
her.
вЂњYour
first
question,
Lady
Catelyn?вЂќ

Not
knowing
how
long
this
game
might
continue,
Catelyn
wasted
no
time.
вЂњAre
you
JoffreyвЂ™s
father?вЂќ

вЂњYou
would
never
ask
unless
you
knew
the
answer.вЂќ

вЂњI
want
it
from
your
own
lips.вЂќ

He
shrugged.
вЂњJoffrey
is
mine.
As
are
the
rest
of
CerseiвЂ™s
brood,
I
suppose.вЂќ

вЂњYou
admit
to
being
your
sisterвЂ™s
lover?вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ve
always
loved
my
sister,
and
you
owe
me
two
answers.
Do
all
my
kin
still
live?вЂќ

вЂњSer
Stafford
Lannister
was
slain
at
Oxcross,
I
am
told.вЂќ

Jaime
was
unmoved.
вЂњUncle
Dolt,
my
sister
called
him.
itвЂ™s
Cersei
and
Tyrion
who
concern
me.
As
well
as
my
lord
father.вЂќ

вЂњThey
live,
all
three.вЂќ
But
not
long,
if
the
gods
are
good.

Jaime
drank
some
more
wine.
вЂњAsk
your
next.вЂќ

Catelyn
wondered
if
he
would
dare
answer
her
next
question
with
anything
but
a
lie.
вЂњHow
did
my
son
Bran
come
to
fall?вЂќ

вЂњI
flung
him
from
a
window.вЂќ

The
easy
way
he
said
it
took
her
voice
away
for
an
instant.
If
I
had
a
knife,
I
would
kill
him
now,
she
thought,
until
she
remembered
the
girls.
Her
throat
constricted
as
she
said,
вЂњYou
were
a
knight,
sworn
to
defend
the
weak
and
innocent.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
weak
enough,
but
perhaps
not
so
innocent.
He
was
spying
on
us.вЂќ

вЂњBran
would
not
spy.вЂќ

вЂњThen
blame
those
precious
gods
of
yours,
who
brought
the
boy
to
our
window
and
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
something
he
was
never
meant
to
see.вЂќ

вЂњBlame
the
gods?вЂќ
she
said,
incredulous.
вЂњYours
was
the
hand
that
threw
him.
You
meant
for
him
to
die.вЂќ

His
chains
chinked
softly.
вЂњI
seldom
fling
children
from
towers
to
improve
their
health.
Yes,
I
meant
for
him
to
die.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
when
he
did
not,
you
knew
your
danger
was
worse
than
ever,
so
you
gave
your
catspaw
a
bag
of
silver
to
make
certain
Bran
would
never
wake.вЂќ

вЂњDid
I
now?вЂќ
Jaime
lifted
his
cup
and
took
a
long
swallow.
вЂњI
wonвЂ™t
deny
we
talked
of
it,
but
you
were
with
the
boy
day
and
night,
your
maester
and
Lord
Eddard
attended
him
frequently,
and
there
were
guards,
even
those
damned
direwolvesвЂ¦
it
would
have
required
cutting
my
way
through
half
of
Winterfell.
And
why
bother,
when
the
boy
seemed
like
to
die
of
his
own
accord?вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
lie
to
me,
this
session
is
at
an
end.вЂќ
Catelyn
held
out
her
hands,
to
show
him
her
fingers
and
palms.
вЂњThe
man
who
came
to
slit
BranвЂ™s
throat
gave
me
these
scars.
You
swear
you
had
no
part
in
sending
him?вЂќ

вЂњOn
my
honor
as
a
Lannister.вЂќ

вЂњYour
honor
as
a
Lannister
is
worth
less
than
this.вЂќ
She
kicked
over
the
waste
pail.
Foul-smelling
brown
ooze
crept
across
the
floor
of
the
cell,
soaking
into
the
straw.

Jaime
Lannister
backed
away
from
the
spill
as
far
as
his
chains
would
allow.
вЂњI
may
indeed
have
shit
for
honor,
I
wonвЂ™t
deny
it,
but
I
have
never
yet
hired
anyone
to
do
my
killing.
Believe
what
you
will,
Lady
Stark,
but
if
I
had
wanted
your
Bran
dead
I
would
have
slain
him
myself.вЂќ

Gods
be
merciful,
heвЂ™s
telling
the
truth.
вЂњIf
you
did
not
send
the
killer,
your
sister
did.вЂќ

вЂњIf
so,
IвЂ™d
know.
Cersei
keeps
no
secrets
from
me.вЂќ

вЂњThen
it
was
the
Imp.вЂќ

вЂњTyrion
is
as
innocent
as
your
Bran.
He
wasnвЂ™t
climbing
around
outside
of
anyoneвЂ™s
window,
spying.вЂќ

вЂњThen
why
did
the
assassin
have
his
dagger?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
dagger
was
this?вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
so
long,вЂќ
she
said,
holding
her
hands
apart,
вЂњplain,
but
finely
made,
with
a
blade
of
Valyrian
steel
and
a
dragonbone
hilt.
Your
brother
won
it
from
Lord
Baelish
at
the
tourney
on
Prince
JoffreyвЂ™s
name
day.вЂќ

Lannister
poured,
drank,
poured,
and
stared
into
his
wine
cup.
вЂњThis
wine
seems
to
be
improving
as
I
drink
it.
Imagine
that.
I
seem
to
remember
that
dagger,
now
that
you
describe
it.
Won
it,
you
say?
How?вЂќ

вЂњWagering
on
you
when
you
tilted
against
the
Knight
of
Flowers.вЂќ
Yet
when
she
heard
her
own
words
Catelyn
knew
she
had
gotten
it
wrong.
вЂњNoвЂ¦
was
it
the
other
way?вЂќ

вЂњTyrion
always
backed
me
in
the
lists,вЂќ
Jaime
said,
вЂњbut
that
day
Ser
Loras
unhorsed
me.
A
mischance,
I
took
the
boy
too
lightly,
but
no
matter.
Whatever
my
brother
wagered,
he
lostвЂ¦
but
that
dagger
did
change
hands,
I
recall
it
now.
Robert
showed
it
to
me
that
night
at
the
feast.
His
Grace
loved
to
salt
my
wounds,
especially
when
drunk.
And
when
was
he
not
drunk?вЂќ

Tyrion
Lannister
had
said
much
the
same
thing
as
they
rode
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
Catelyn
remembered.
She
had
refused
to
believe
him.
Petyr
had
sworn
otherwise,
Petyr
who
had
been
almost
a
brother,
Petyr
who
loved
her
so
much
he
fought
a
duel
for
her
handвЂ¦
and
yet
if
Jaime
and
Tyrion
told
the
same
tale,
what
did
that
mean?
The
brothers
had
not
seen
each
other
since
departing
Winterfell
more
than
a
year
ago.
вЂњAre
you
trying
to
deceive
me?вЂќ
Somewhere
there
was
a
trap
here.

вЂњIвЂ™ve
admitted
to
shoving
your
precious
urchin
out
a
window,
what
would
it
gain
me
to
lie
about
this
knife?вЂќ
He
tossed
down
another
cup
of
wine.
вЂњBelieve
what
you
will,
IвЂ™m
past
caring
what
people
say
of
me.
And
itвЂ™s
my
turn.
Have
RobertвЂ™s
brothers
taken
the
field?вЂќ

вЂњThey
have.вЂќ

вЂњNow
thereвЂ™s
a
niggardly
response.
Give
me
more
than
that,
or
your
next
answer
will
be
as
poor.вЂќ

вЂњStannis
marches
against
KingвЂ™s
Landing,вЂќ
she
said
grudgingly.
вЂњRenly
is
dead,
murdered
at
Bitterbridge
by
his
brother,
through
some
black
art
I
do
not
understand.вЂќ

вЂњA
pity,вЂќ
Jaime
said.
вЂњI
rather
liked
Renly,
though
Stannis
is
quite
another
tale.
What
side
have
the
Tyrells
taken?вЂќ

вЂњRenly,
at
first.
Now,
I
could
not
say.вЂќ

вЂњYour
boy
must
be
feeling
lonely.вЂќ

вЂњRobb
was
sixteen
a
few
days
pastвЂ¦
a
man
grown,
and
a
king.
HeвЂ™s
won
every
battle
heвЂ™s
fought.
The
last
word
we
had
from
him,
he
had
taken
the
Crag
from
the
Westerlings.вЂќ

вЂњHe
hasnвЂ™t
faced
my
father
yet,
has
he?вЂќ

вЂњWhen
he
does,
heвЂ™ll
defeat
him.
As
he
did
you.вЂќ

вЂњHe
took
me
unawares.
A
cravenвЂ™s
trick.вЂќ

вЂњYou
dare
talk
of
tricks?
Your
brother
Tyrion
sent
us
cutthroats
in
envoyвЂ™s
garb,
under
a
peace
banner.вЂќ

вЂњIf
it
were
one
of
your
sons
in
this
cell,
wouldnвЂ™t
his
brothers
do
as
much
for
him?вЂќ

My
son
has
no
brothers,
she
thought,
but
she
would
not
share
her
pain
with
a
creature
such
as
this.

Jaime
drank
some
more
wine.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
a
brotherвЂ™s
life
when
honor
is
at
stake,
eh?вЂќ
Another
sip.
вЂњTyrion
is
clever
enough
to
realize
that
your
son
will
never
consent
to
ransom
me.вЂќ

Catelyn
could
not
deny
it.
вЂњRobbвЂ™s
bannermen
would
sooner
see
you
dead.
Rickard
Karstark
in
particular.
You
slew
two
of
his
sons
in
the
Whispering
Wood.вЂќ

вЂњThe
two
with
the
white
sunburst,
were
they?вЂќ
Jaime
gave
a
shrug.
вЂњIf
truth
be
told,
it
was
your
son
that
I
was
trying
to
slay.
The
others
got
in
my
way.
I
killed
them
in
fair
fight,
in
the
heat
of
battle.
Any
other
knight
would
have
done
the
same.вЂќ

вЂњHow
can
you
still
count
yourself
a
knight,
when
you
have
forsaken
every
vow
you
ever
swore?вЂќ

Jaime
reached
for
the
flagon
to
refill
his
cup.
вЂњSo
many
vowsвЂ¦
they
make
you
swear
and
swear.
Defend
the
king.
Obey
the
king.
Keep
his
secrets.
Do
his
bidding.
Your
life
for
his.
But
obey
your
father.
Love
your
sister.
Protect
the
innocent.
Defend
the
weak.
Respect
the
gods.
Obey
the
laws.
ItвЂ™s
too
much.
No
matter
what
you
do,
youвЂ™re
forsaking
one
vow
or
the
other.вЂќ
He
took
a
healthy
swallow
of
wine
and
closed
his
eyes
for
an
instant,
leaning
his
head
back
against
the
patch
of
nitre
on
the
wall.
вЂњI
was
the
youngest
man
ever
to
wear
the
white
cloak.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
youngest
to
betray
all
it
stood
for,
Kingslayer.вЂќ

вЂњKingslayer,вЂќ
he
pronounced
carefully.
вЂњAnd
such
a
king
he
was!вЂќ
He
lifted
his
cup.
вЂњTo
Aerys
Targaryen,
the
Second
of
His
Name,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
And
to
the
sword
that
opened
his
throat.
A
golden
sword,
donвЂ™t
you
know.
Until
his
blood
ran
red
down
the
blade.
Those
are
the
Lannister
colors,
red
and
gold.вЂќ

As
he
laughed,
she
realized
the
wine
had
done
its
work;
Jaime
had
drained
most
of
the
flagon,
and
he
was
drunk.
вЂњOnly
a
man
like
you
would
be
proud
of
such
an
act.вЂќ

вЂњI
told
you,
there
are
no
men
like
me.
Answer
me
this,
Lady
StarkвЂ”did
your
Ned
ever
tell
you
the
manner
of
his
fatherвЂ™s
death?
Or
his
brotherвЂ™s?вЂќ

вЂњThey
strangled
Brandon
while
his
father
watched,
and
then
killed
Lord
Rickard
as
well.вЂќ
An
ugly
tale,
and
sixteen
years
old.
Why
was
he
asking
about
it
now?

вЂњKilled,
yes,
but
how?вЂќ

вЂњThe
cord
or
the
axe,
I
suppose.вЂќ

Jaime
took
a
swallow,
wiped
his
mouth.
вЂњNo
doubt
Ned
wished
to
spare
you.
His
sweet
young
bride,
if
not
quite
a
maiden.
Well,
you
wanted
truth.
Ask
me.
We
made
a
bargain,
I
can
deny
you
nothing.
Ask.вЂќ

вЂњDead
is
dead.вЂќ
I
do
not
want
to
know
this.

вЂњBrandon
was
different
from
his
brother,
wasnвЂ™t
he?
He
had
blood
in
his
veins
instead
of
cold
water.
More
like
me.вЂќ

вЂњBrandon
was
nothing
like
you.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
say
so.
You
and
he
were
to
wed.вЂќ

вЂњHe
was
on
his
way
to
Riverrun
whenвЂ¦вЂќ
Strange,
how
telling
it
still
made
her
throat
grow
tight,
after
all
these
years.
вЂњвЂ¦when
he
heard
about
Lyanna,
and
went
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
instead.
It
was
a
rash
thing
to
do.вЂќ
She
remembered
how
her
own
father
had
raged
when
the
news
had
been
brought
to
Riverrun.
The
gallant
fool,
was
what
he
called
Brandon.

Jaime
poured
the
last
half
cup
of
wine.
вЂњHe
rode
into
the
Red
Keep
with
a
few
companions,
shouting
for
Prince
Rhaegar
to
come
out
and
die.
But
Rhaegar
wasnвЂ™t
there.
Aerys
sent
his
guards
to
arrest
them
all
for
plotting
his
sonвЂ™s
murder.
The
others
were
lordsвЂ™
sons
too,
it
seems
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњEthan
Glover
was
BrandonвЂ™s
squire,вЂќ
Catelyn
said.
вЂњHe
was
the
only
one
to
survive.
The
others
were
Jeffory
Mallister,
Kyle
Royce,
and
Elbert
Arryn,
Jon
ArrynвЂ™s
nephew
and
heir.вЂќ
It
was
queer
how
she
still
remembered
the
names,
after
so
many
years.
вЂњAerys
accused
them
of
treason
and
summoned
their
fathers
to
court
to
answer
the
charge,
with
the
sons
as
hostages.
When
they
came,
he
had
them
murdered
without
trial.
Fathers
and
sons
both.вЂќ

вЂњThere
were
trials.
Of
a
sort.
Lord
Rickard
demanded
trial
by
combat,
and
the
king
granted
the
request.
Stark
armored
himself
as
for
battle,
thinking
to
duel
one
of
the
Kingsguard.
Me,
perhaps.
Instead
they
took
him
to
the
throne
room
and
suspended
him
from
the
rafters
while
two
of
AerysвЂ™s
pyromancers
kindled
a
blaze
beneath
him.
The
king
told
him
that
fire
was
the
champion
of
House
Targaryen.
So
all
Lord
Rickard
needed
to
do
to
prove
himself
innocent
of
treason
wasвЂ¦
well,
not
burn.

вЂњWhen
the
fire
was
blazing,
Brandon
was
brought
in.
His
hands
were
chained
behind
his
back,
and
around
his
neck
was
a
wet
leathern
cord
attached
to
a
device
the
king
had
brought
from
Tyrosh.
His
legs
were
left
free,
though,
and
his
longsword
was
set
down
just
beyond
his
reach.

вЂњThe
pyromancers
roasted
Lord
Rickard
slowly,
banking
and
fanning
that
fire
carefully
to
get
a
nice
even
heat.
His
cloak
caught
first,
and
then
his
surcoat,
and
soon
he
wore
nothing
but
metal
and
ashes.
Next
he
would
start
to
cook,
Aerys
promisedвЂ¦
unless
his
son
could
free
him.
Brandon
tried,
but
the
more
he
struggled,
the
tighter
the
cord
constricted
around
his
throat.
In
the
end
he
strangled
himself.

вЂњAs
for
Lord
Rickard,
the
steel
of
his
breastplate
turned
cherry-red
before
the
end,
and
his
gold
melted
off
his
spurs
and
dripped
down
into
the
fire.
I
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne
in
my
white
armor
and
white
cloak,
filling
my
head
with
thoughts
of
Cersei.
After,
Gerold
Hightower
himself
took
me
aside
and
said
to
me,
вЂYou
swore
a
vow
to
guard
the
king,
not
to
judge
him.вЂ™
That
was
the
White
Bull,
loyal
to
the
end
and
a
better
man
than
me,
all
agree.вЂќ

вЂњAerysвЂ¦вЂќ
Catelyn
could
taste
bile
at
the
back
of
her
throat.
The
story
was
so
hideous
she
suspected
it
had
to
be
true.
вЂњAerys
was
mad,
the
whole
realm
knew
it,
but
if
you
would
have
me
believe
you
slew
him
to
avenge
Brandon
StarkвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњI
made
no
such
claim.
The
Starks
were
nothing
to
me.
I
will
say,
I
think
it
passing
odd
that
I
am
loved
by
one
for
a
kindness
I
never
did,
and
reviled
by
so
many
for
my
finest
act.
At
RobertвЂ™s
coronation,
I
was
made
to
kneel
at
the
royal
feet
beside
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
and
Varys
the
eunuch,
so
that
he
might
forgive
us
our
crimes
before
he
took
us
into
his
service.
As
for
your
Ned,
he
should
have
kissed
the
hand
that
slew
Aerys,
but
he
preferred
to
scorn
the
arse
he
found
sitting
on
RobertвЂ™s
throne.
I
think
Ned
Stark
loved
Robert
better
than
he
ever
loved
his
brother
or
his
fatherвЂ¦
or
even
you,
my
lady.
He
was
never
unfaithful
to
Robert,
was
he?вЂќ
Jaime
gave
a
drunken
laugh.
вЂњCome,
Lady
Stark,
donвЂ™t
you
find
this
all
terribly
amusing?вЂќ

вЂњI
find
nothing
about
you
amusing,
Kingslayer.вЂќ

вЂњThat
name
again.
I
donвЂ™t
think
IвЂ™ll
fuck
you
after
all,
Littlefinger
had
you
first,
didnвЂ™t
he?
I
never
eat
off
another
manвЂ™s
trencher.
Besides,
youвЂ™re
not
half
so
lovely
as
my
sister.вЂќ
His
smile
cut.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
never
lain
with
any
woman
but
Cersei.
In
my
own
way,
I
have
been
truer
than
your
Ned
ever
was.
Poor
old
dead
Ned.
So
who
has
shit
for
honor
now,
I
ask
you?
What
was
the
name
of
that
bastard
he
fathered?вЂќ

Catelyn
took
a
step
backward.
вЂњBrienne.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
that
wasnвЂ™t
it.вЂќ
Jaime
Lannister
upended
the
flagon.
A
trickle
ran
down
onto
his
face,
bright
as
blood.
вЂњSnow,
that
was
the
one.
Such
a
white
nameвЂ¦
like
the
pretty
cloaks
they
give
us
in
the
Kingsguard
when
we
swear
our
pretty
oaths.вЂќ

Brienne
pushed
open
the
door
and
stepped
inside
the
cell.
вЂњYou
called,
my
lady?вЂќ

вЂњGive
me
your
sword.вЂќ
Catelyn
held
out
her
hand.





THEON

The
sky
was
a
gloom
of
cloud,
the
woods
dead
and
frozen.
Roots
grabbed
at
TheonвЂ™s
feet
as
he
ran,
and
bare
branches
lashed
his
face,
leaving
thin
stripes
of
blood
across
his
cheeks.
He
crashed
through
heedless,
breathless,
icicles
flying
to
pieces
before
him.
Mercy,
he
sobbed.
From
behind
came
a
shuddering
howl
that
curdled
his
blood.
Mercy,
mercy.
When
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
them
coming,
great
wolves
the
size
of
horses
with
the
heads
of
small
children.
Oh,
mercy,
mercy.
Blood
dripped
from
their
mouths
black
as
pitch,
burning
holes
in
the
snow
where
it
fell.
Every
stride
brought
them
closer.
Theon
tried
to
run
faster,
but
his
legs
would
not
obey.
The
trees
all
had
faces,
and
they
were
laughing
at
him,
laughing,
and
the
howl
came
again.
He
could
smell
the
hot
breath
of
the
beasts
behind
him,
a
stink
of
brimstone
and
corruption.
TheyвЂ™re
dead,
dead,
I
saw
them
killed,
he
tried
to
shout,
I
saw
their
heads
dipped
in
tar,
but
when
he
opened
his
mouth
only
a
moan
emerged,
and
then
something
touched
him
and
he
whirled,
shoutingвЂ¦

вЂ¦flailing
for
the
dagger
he
kept
by
his
bedside
and
managing
only
to
knock
it
to
the
floor.
Wex
danced
away
from
him.
Reek
stood
behind
the
mute,
his
face
lit
from
below
by
the
candle
he
carried.
вЂњWhat?вЂќ
Theon
cried.
Mercy.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want?
Why
are
you
in
my
bedchamber?
Why?вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord
prince,вЂќ
said
Reek,
вЂњyour
sister
has
come
to
Winterfell.
You
asked
to
be
informed
at
once
if
she
arrived.вЂќ

вЂњPast
time,вЂќ
Theon
muttered,
pushing
his
fingers
through
his
hair.
He
had
begun
to
fear
that
Asha
meant
to
leave
him
to
his
fate.
Mercy.
He
glanced
outside
the
window,
where
the
first
vague
light
of
dawn
was
just
brushing
the
towers
of
Winterfell.
вЂњWhere
is
she?вЂќ

вЂњLorren
took
her
and
her
men
to
the
Great
Hall
to
break
their
fast.
Will
you
see
her
now?вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
Theon
pushed
off
the
blankets.
The
fire
had
burned
down
to
embers.
вЂњWex,
hot
water.вЂќ
He
could
not
let
Asha
see
him
disheveled
and
soaked
with
sweat.
Wolves
with
childrenвЂ™s
facesвЂ¦
He
shivered.
вЂњClose
the
shutters.вЂќ
The
bedchamber
felt
as
cold
as
the
dream
forest
had
been.

All
his
dreams
had
been
cold
of
late,
and
each
more
hideous
than
the
one
before.
Last
night
he
had
dreamed
himself
back
in
the
mill
again,
on
his
knees
dressing
the
dead.
Their
limbs
were
already
stiffening,
so
they
seemed
to
resist
sullenly
as
he
fumbled
at
them
with
half-frozen
fingers,
tugging
up
breeches
and
knotting
laces,
yanking
fur-trimmed
boots
over
hard
unbending
feet,
buckling
a
studded
leather
belt
around
a
waist
no
bigger
than
the
span
of
his
hands.
вЂњThis
was
never
what
I
wanted,вЂќ
he
told
them
as
he
worked.
вЂњThey
gave
me
no
choice.вЂќ
The
corpses
made
no
answer,
but
only
grew
colder
and
heavier.

The
night
before,
it
had
been
the
millerвЂ™s
wife.
Theon
had
forgotten
her
name,
but
he
remembered
her
body,
soft
pillowy
breasts
and
stretch
marks
on
her
belly,
the
way
she
clawed
his
back
when
he
fucked
her.
Last
night
in
his
dream
he
had
been
in
bed
with
her
once
again,
but
this
time
she
had
teeth
above
and
below,
and
she
tore
out
his
throat
even
as
she
was
gnawing
off
his
manhood.
It
was
madness.
HeвЂ™d
seen
her
die
too.
Gelmarr
had
cut
her
down
with
one
blow
of
his
axe
as
she
cried
to
Theon
for
mercy.
Leave
me,
woman.
It
was
him
who
killed
you,
not
me.
And
heвЂ™s
dead
as
well.
At
least
Gelmarr
did
not
haunt
TheonвЂ™s
sleep.

The
dream
had
receded
by
the
time
Wex
returned
with
the
water.
Theon
washed
the
sweat
and
sleep
from
his
body
and
took
his
own
good
time
dressing.
Asha
had
let
him
wait
long
enough;
now
it
was
her
turn.
He
chose
a
satin
tunic
striped
black
and
gold
and
a
fine
leather
jerkin
with
silver
studsвЂ¦
and
only
then
remembered
that
his
wretched
sister
put
more
stock
in
blades
than
beauty.
Cursing,
he
tore
off
the
clothes
and
dressed
again,
in
felted
black
wool
and
ringmail.
Around
his
waist
he
buckled
sword
and
dagger,
remembering
the
night
she
had
humiliated
him
at
his
own
fatherвЂ™s
table.
Her
sweet
suckling
babe,
yes.
Well,
I
have
a
knife
too,
and
know
how
to
use
it.

Last
of
all,
he
donned
his
crown,
a
band
of
cold
iron
slim
as
a
finger,
set
with
heavy
chunks
of
black
diamond
and
nuggets
of
gold.
It
was
misshapen
and
ugly,
but
there
was
no
help
for
that.
Mikken
lay
buried
in
the
lichyard,
and
the
new
smith
was
capable
of
little
more
than
nails
and
horseshoes.
Theon
consoled
himself
with
the
reminder
that
it
was
only
a
princeвЂ™s
crown.
He
would
have
something
much
finer
when
he
was
crowned
king.

Outside
his
door,
Reek
waited
with
Urzen
and
Kromm.
Theon
fell
in
with
them.
These
days,
he
took
guards
with
him
everywhere
he
went,
even
to
the
privy.
Winterfell
wanted
him
dead.
The
very
night
they
had
returned
from
Acorn
Water,
Gelmarr
the
Grim
had
tumbled
down
some
steps
and
broken
his
back.
The
next
day,
Aggar
turned
up
with
his
throat
slit
ear
to
ear.
Gynir
Rednose
became
so
wary
that
he
shunned
wine,
took
to
sleeping
in
byrnie,
coif,
and
helm,
and
adopted
the
noisiest
dog
in
the
kennels
to
give
him
warning
should
anyone
try
to
steal
up
on
his
sleeping
place.
All
the
same,
one
morning
the
castle
woke
to
the
sound
of
the
little
dog
barking
wildly.
They
found
the
pup
racing
around
the
well,
and
Rednose
floating
in
it,
drowned.

He
could
not
let
the
killings
go
unpunished.
Farlen
was
as
likely
a
suspect
as
any,
so
Theon
sat
in
judgment,
called
him
guilty,
and
condemned
him
to
death.
Even
that
went
sour.
As
he
knelt
to
the
block,
the
kennelmaster
said,
вЂњMвЂ™lord
Eddard
always
did
his
own
killings.вЂќ
Theon
had
to
take
the
axe
himself
or
look
a
weakling.
His
hands
were
sweating,
so
the
shaft
twisted
in
his
grip
as
he
swung
and
the
first
blow
landed
between
FarlenвЂ™s
shoulders.
It
took
three
more
cuts
to
hack
through
all
that
bone
and
muscle
and
sever
the
head
from
the
body,
and
afterward
he
was
sick,
remembering
all
the
times
theyвЂ™d
sat
over
a
cup
of
mead
talking
of
hounds
and
hunting.
I
had
no
choice,
he
wanted
to
scream
at
the
corpse.
The
ironborn
canвЂ™t
keep
secrets,
they
had
to
die,
and
someone
had
to
take
the
blame
for
it.
He
only
wished
he
had
killed
him
cleaner.
Ned
Stark
had
never
needed
more
than
a
single
blow
to
take
a
manвЂ™s
head.

The
killings
stopped
after
FarlenвЂ™s
death,
but
even
so
his
men
continued
sullen
and
anxious.
вЂњThey
fear
no
foe
in
open
battle,вЂќ
Black
Lorren
told
him,
вЂњbut
it
is
another
thing
to
dwell
among
enemies,
never
knowing
if
the
washerwoman
means
to
kiss
you
or
kill
you,
or
whether
the
serving
boy
is
filling
your
cup
with
ale
or
bale.
We
would
do
well
to
leave
this
place.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
the
Prince
of
Winterfell!вЂќ
Theon
had
shouted.
вЂњThis
is
my
seat,
no
man
will
drive
me
from
it.
No,
nor
woman
either!вЂќ

Asha.
It
was
her
doing.
My
own
sweet
sister,
may
the
Others
bugger
her
with
a
sword.
She
wanted
him
dead,
so
she
could
steal
his
place
as
their
fatherвЂ™s
heir.
That
was
why
she
had
let
him
languish
here,
ignoring
the
urgent
commands
he
had
sent
her.

He
found
her
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks,
ripping
a
capon
apart
with
her
fingers.
The
hall
rang
with
the
voices
of
her
men,
sharing
stories
with
TheonвЂ™s
own
as
they
drank
together.
They
were
so
loud
that
his
entrance
went
all
but
unnoticed.
вЂњWhere
are
the
rest?вЂќ
he
demanded
of
Reek.
There
were
no
more
than
fifty
men
at
the
trestle
tables,
most
of
them
his.
WinterfellвЂ™s
Great
Hall
could
have
seated
ten
times
the
number.

вЂњThis
is
the
whole
oвЂ™
the
company,
mвЂ™lord
prince.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wholeвЂ”how
many
men
did
she
bring?вЂќ

вЂњTwenty,
by
my
count.вЂќ

Theon
Greyjoy
strode
to
where
his
sister
was
sprawled.
Asha
was
laughing
at
something
one
of
her
men
had
said,
but
broke
off
at
his
approach.
вЂњWhy,
вЂ™tis
the
Prince
of
Winterfell.вЂќ
She
tossed
a
bone
to
one
of
the
dogs
sniffing
about
the
hall.
Under
that
hawkвЂ™s
beak
of
a
nose,
her
wide
mouth
twisted
in
a
mocking
grin.
вЂњOr
is
it
Prince
of
Fools?вЂќ

вЂњEnvy
ill
becomes
a
maid.вЂќ

Asha
sucked
grease
from
her
fingers.
A
lock
of
black
hair
fell
across
her
eyes.
Her
men
were
shouting
for
bread
and
bacon.
They
made
a
deal
of
noise,
as
few
as
they
were.
вЂњEnvy,
Theon?вЂќ

вЂњWhat
else
would
you
call
it?
With
thirty
men,
I
captured
Winterfell
in
a
night.
You
needed
a
thousand
and
a
moonвЂ™s
turn
to
take
Deepwood
Motte.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
IвЂ™m
no
great
warrior
like
you,
brother,вЂќ
She
quaffed
half
a
horn
of
ale
and
wiped
her
mouth
with
the
back
of
her
hand.
вЂњI
saw
the
heads
above
your
gates.
Tell
me
true,
which
one
gave
you
the
fiercest
fight,
the
cripple
or
the
babe?вЂќ

Theon
could
feel
the
blood
rushing
to
his
face.
He
took
no
joy
from
those
heads,
no
more
than
he
had
in
displaying
the
headless
bodies
of
the
children
before
the
castle.
Old
Nan
stood
with
her
soft
toothless
mouth
opening
and
closing
soundlessly,
and
Farlen
threw
himself
at
Theon,
snarling
like
one
of
his
hounds.
Urzen
and
Cadwyl
had
to
beat
him
senseless
with
the
butts
of
their
spears.
How
did
I
come
to
this?
he
remembered
thinking
as
he
stood
over
the
fly-speckled
bodies.

Only
Maester
Luwin
had
the
stomach
to
come
near.
Stone-faced,
the
small
grey
man
had
begged
leave
to
sew
the
boysвЂ™
heads
back
onto
their
shoulders,
so
they
might
be
laid
in
the
crypts
below
with
the
other
Stark
dead.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Theon
had
told
him.
вЂњNot
the
crypts.вЂќ

вЂњBut
why,
my
lord?
Surely
they
cannot
harm
you
now.
It
is
where
they
belong.
All
the
bones
of
the
StarksвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњI
said
no.вЂќ
He
needed
the
heads
for
the
wall,
but
he
had
burned
the
headless
bodies
that
very
day,
in
all
their
finery.
Afterward
he
had
knelt
amongst
the
bones
and
ashes
to
retrieve
a
slag
of
melted
silver
and
cracked
jet,
all
that
remained
of
the
wolfвЂ™s-head
brooch
that
had
once
been
BranвЂ™s.
He
had
it
still.

вЂњI
treated
Bran
and
Rickon
generously,вЂќ
he
told
his
sister.
вЂњThey
brought
their
fate
on
themselves.вЂќ

вЂњAs
do
we
all,
little
brother.вЂќ

His
patience
was
at
an
end.
вЂњHow
do
you
expect
me
to
hold
Winterfell
if
you
bring
me
only
twenty
men?вЂќ

вЂњTen,вЂќ
Asha
corrected.
вЂњThe
others
return
with
me.
You
wouldnвЂ™t
want
your
own
sweet
sister
to
brave
the
dangers
of
the
wood
without
an
escort,
would
you?
There
are
direwolves
prowling
the
dark.вЂќ
She
uncoiled
from
the
great
stone
seat
and
rose
to
her
feet.
вЂњCome,
let
us
go
somewhere
we
can
speak
more
privily.вЂќ

She
was
right,
he
knew,
though
it
galled
him
that
she
would
make
that
decision.
I
should
never
have
come
to
the
hall,
he
realized
belatedly.
I
should
have
summoned
her
to
me.

It
was
too
late
for
that
now,
however.
Theon
had
no
choice
but
to
lead
Asha
to
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
solar.
There,
before
the
ashes
of
a
dead
fire,
he
blurted,
вЂњDagmerвЂ™s
lost
the
fight
at
TorrhenвЂ™s
SquareвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThe
old
castellan
broke
his
shield
wall,
yes,вЂќ
Asha
said
calmly.
вЂњWhat
did
you
expect?
This
Ser
Rodrik
knows
the
land
intimately,
as
the
Cleftjaw
does
not,
and
many
of
the
northmen
were
mounted.
The
ironborn
lack
the
discipline
to
stand
a
charge
of
armored
horse.
Dagmer
lives,
be
grateful
for
that
much.
HeвЂ™s
leading
the
survivors
back
toward
the
Stony
Shore.вЂќ

She
knows
more
than
I
do,
Theon
realized.
That
only
made
him
angrier.
вЂњThe
victory
has
given
Leobald
Tallhart
the
courage
to
come
out
from
behind
his
walls
and
join
Ser
Rodrik.
And
IвЂ™ve
had
reports
that
Lord
Manderly
has
sent
a
dozen
barges
upriver
packed
with
knights,
warhorses,
and
siege
engines.
The
Umbers
are
gathering
beyond
the
Last
River
as
well.
IвЂ™ll
have
an
army
at
my
gates
before
the
moon
turns,
and
you
bring
me
only
ten
men?вЂќ

вЂњI
need
not
have
brought
you
any.вЂќ

вЂњI
commanded
youвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњFather
commanded
me
to
take
Deepwood
Motte,вЂќ
she
snapped.
вЂњHe
said
nothing
of
me
having
to
rescue
my
little
brother.вЂќ

вЂњBugger
Deepwood,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњItвЂ™s
a
wooden
pisspot
on
a
hill.
Winterfell
is
the
heart
of
the
land,
but
how
am
I
to
hold
it
without
a
garrison?вЂќ

вЂњYou
might
have
thought
of
that
before
you
took
it.
Oh,
it
was
cleverly
done,
IвЂ™ll
grant
you.
If
only
youвЂ™d
had
the
good
sense
to
raze
the
castle
and
carry
the
two
little
princelings
back
to
Pyke
as
hostages,
you
might
have
won
the
war
in
a
stroke.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
like
that,
wouldnвЂ™t
you?
To
see
my
prize
reduced
to
ruins
and
ashes.вЂќ

вЂњYour
prize
will
be
the
doom
of
you.
Krakens
rise
from
the
sea,
Theon,
or
did
you
forget
that
during
your
years
among
the
wolves?
Our
strength
is
in
our
longships.
My
wooden
pisspot
sits
close
enough
to
the
sea
for
supplies
and
fresh
men
to
reach
me
whenever
they
are
needful.
But
Winterfell
is
hundreds
of
leagues
inland,
ringed
by
woods,
hills,
and
hostile
holdfasts
and
castles.
And
every
man
in
a
thousand
leagues
is
your
enemy
now,
make
no
mistake.
You
made
certain
of
that
when
you
mounted
those
heads
on
your
gatehouse.вЂќ
Asha
shook
her
head.
вЂњHow
could
you
be
such
a
bloody
fool?
ChildrenвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњThey
defied
me!вЂќ
he
shouted
in
her
face.
вЂњAnd
it
was
blood
for
blood
besides,
two
sons
of
Eddard
Stark
to
pay
for
Rodrik
and
Maron.вЂќ
The
words
tumbled
out
heedlessly,
but
Theon
knew
at
once
that
his
father
would
approve.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
laid
my
brothersвЂ™
ghosts
to
rest.вЂќ

вЂњOur
brothers,вЂќ
Asha
reminded
him,
with
a
half
smile
that
suggested
she
took
his
talk
of
vengeance
well
salted.
вЂњDid
you
bring
their
ghosts
from
Pyke,
brother?
And
here
I
thought
they
haunted
only
Father.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
has
a
maid
ever
understood
a
manвЂ™s
need
for
revenge?вЂќ
Even
if
his
father
did
not
appreciate
the
gift
of
Winterfell,
he
must
approve
of
Theon
avenging
his
brothers!

Asha
snorted
back
a
laugh.
вЂњThis
Ser
Rodrik
may
well
feel
the
same
manly
need,
did
you
think
of
that?
You
are
blood
of
my
blood,
Theon,
whatever
else
you
may
be.
For
the
sake
of
the
mother
who
bore
us
both,
return
to
Deepwood
Motte
with
me.
Put
Winterfell
to
the
torch
and
fall
back
while
you
still
can.вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
Theon
adjusted
his
crown.
вЂњI
took
this
castle
and
I
mean
to
hold
it.вЂќ

His
sister
looked
at
him
a
long
time.
вЂњThen
hold
it
you
shall,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњfor
the
rest
of
your
life.вЂќ
She
sighed.
вЂњI
say
it
tastes
like
folly,
but
what
would
a
shy
maid
know
of
such
things?вЂќ
At
the
door
she
gave
him
one
last
mocking
smile.
вЂњYou
ought
to
know,
thatвЂ™s
the
ugliest
crown
IвЂ™ve
ever
laid
eyes
on.
Did
you
make
it
yourself?вЂќ

She
left
him
fuming,
and
lingered
no
longer
than
was
needful
to
feed
and
water
her
horses.
Half
the
men
sheвЂ™d
brought
returned
with
her
as
threatened,
riding
out
the
same
HunterвЂ™s
Gate
that
Bran
and
Rickon
had
used
for
their
escape.

Theon
watched
them
go
from
atop
the
wall.
As
his
sister
vanished
into
the
mists
of
the
wolfswood
he
found
himself
wondering
why
he
had
not
listened
and
gone
with
her.

вЂњGone,
has
she?вЂќ
Reek
was
at
his
elbow.

Theon
had
not
heard
him
approach,
nor
smelled
him
either.
He
could
not
think
of
anyone
he
wanted
to
see
less.
It
made
him
uneasy
to
see
the
man
walking
around
breathing,
with
what
he
knew.
I
should
have
had
him
killed
after
he
did
the
others,
he
reflected,
but
the
notion
made
him
nervous.
Unlikely
as
it
seemed,
Reek
could
read
and
write,
and
he
was
possessed
of
enough
base
cunning
to
have
hidden
an
account
of
what
theyвЂ™d
done.

вЂњMвЂ™lord
prince,
if
youвЂ™ll
pardon
me
saying,
itвЂ™s
not
right
for
her
to
abandon
you.
And
ten
men,
that
wonвЂ™t
be
near
enough.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
well
aware
of
that,вЂќ
Theon
said.
So
was
Asha.

вЂњWell,
might
be
I
could
help
you,вЂќ
said
Reek.
вЂњGive
me
a
horse
and
bag
oвЂ™
coin,
and
I
could
find
you
some
good
fellows.вЂќ

Theon
narrowed
his
eyes.
вЂњHow
many?вЂќ

вЂњA
hundred,
might
be.
Two
hundred.
Maybe
more.вЂќ
He
smiled,
his
pale
eyes
glinting.
вЂњI
was
born
up
north
here.
I
know
many
a
man,
and
many
a
man
knows
Reek.вЂќ

Two
hundred
men
were
not
an
army,
but
you
didnвЂ™t
need
thousands
to
hold
a
castle
as
strong
as
Winterfell.
So
long
as
they
could
learn
which
end
of
a
spear
did
the
killing,
they
might
make
all
the
difference.
вЂњDo
as
you
say
and
youвЂ™ll
not
find
me
ungrateful.
You
can
name
your
own
reward.вЂќ

вЂњWell,
mвЂ™lord,
I
havenвЂ™t
had
no
woman
since
I
was
with
Lord
Ramsay,вЂќ
Reek
said.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
had
my
eye
on
that
Palla,
and
I
hear
sheвЂ™s
already
been
had,
soвЂ¦вЂќ

He
had
gone
too
far
with
Reek
to
turn
back
now.
вЂњTwo
hundred
men
and
sheвЂ™s
yours.
But
a
man
less
and
you
can
go
back
to
fucking
pigs.вЂќ

Reek
was
gone
before
the
sun
went
down,
carrying
a
bag
of
Stark
silver
and
the
last
of
TheonвЂ™s
hopes.
Like
as
not,
IвЂ™ll
never
see
the
wretch
again,
he
thought
bitterly,
but
even
so
the
chance
had
to
be
taken.

That
night
he
dreamed
of
the
feast
Ned
Stark
had
thrown
when
King
Robert
came
to
Winterfell.
The
hall
rang
with
music
and
laughter,
though
the
cold
winds
were
rising
outside.
At
first
it
was
all
wine
and
roast
meat,
and
Theon
was
making
japes
and
eyeing
the
serving
girls
and
having
himself
a
fine
timeвЂ¦
until
he
noticed
that
the
room
was
growing
darker.
The
music
did
not
seem
so
jolly
then;
he
heard
discords
and
strange
silences,
and
notes
that
hung
in
the
air
bleeding.
Suddenly
the
wine
turned
bitter
in
his
mouth,
and
when
he
looked
up
from
his
cup
he
saw
that
he
was
dining
with
the
dead.

King
Robert
sat
with
his
guts
spilling
out
on
the
table
from
the
great
gash
in
his
belly,
and
Lord
Eddard
was
headless
beside
him.
Corpses
lined
the
benches
below,
grey-brown
flesh
sloughing
off
their
bones
as
they
raised
their
cups
to
toast,
worms
crawling
in
and
out
of
the
holes
that
were
their
eyes.
He
knew
them,
every
one;
Jory
Cassel
and
Fat
Tom,
Porther
and
Cayn
and
Hullen
the
master
of
horse,
and
all
the
others
who
had
ridden
south
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing
never
to
return.
Mikken
and
Chayle
sat
together,
one
dripping
blood
and
the
other
water.
Benfred
Tallhart
and
his
Wild
Hares
filled
most
of
a
table.
The
millerвЂ™s
wife
was
there
as
well,
and
Farlen,
even
the
wildling
Theon
had
killed
in
the
wolfswood
the
day
he
had
saved
BranвЂ™s
life.

But
there
were
others
with
faces
he
had
never
known
in
life,
faces
he
had
seen
only
in
stone.
The
slim,
sad
girl
who
wore
a
crown
of
pale
blue
roses
and
a
white
gown
spattered
with
gore
could
only
be
Lyanna.
Her
brother
Brandon
stood
beside
her,
and
their
father
Lord
Rickard
just
behind.
Along
the
walls
figures
half-seen
moved
through
the
shadows,
pale
shades
with
long
grim
faces.
The
sight
of
them
sent
fear
shivering
through
Theon
sharp
as
a
knife.
And
then
the
tall
doors
opened
with
a
crash,
and
a
freezing
gale
blew
down
the
hall,
and
Robb
came
walking
out
of
the
night.
Grey
Wind
stalked
beside,
eyes
burning,
and
man
and
wolf
alike
bled
from
half
a
hundred
savage
wounds.

Theon
woke
with
a
scream,
startling
Wex
so
badly
that
the
boy
ran
naked
from
the
room.
When
his
guards
burst
in
with
drawn
swords,
he
ordered
them
to
bring
him
the
maester.
By
the
time
Luwin
arrived
rumpled
and
sleepy,
a
cup
of
wine
had
steadied
TheonвЂ™s
hands,
and
he
was
feeling
ashamed
of
his
panic.
вЂњA
dream,вЂќ
he
muttered,
вЂњthat
was
all
it
was.
It
meant
nothing.вЂќ

вЂњNothing,вЂќ
Luwin
agreed
solemnly.
He
left
a
sleeping
draught,
but
Theon
poured
it
down
the
privy
shaft
the
moment
he
was
gone.
Luwin
was
a
man
as
well
as
a
maester,
and
the
man
had
no
love
for
him.
He
wants
me
to
sleep,
yesвЂ¦
to
sleep
and
never
wake.
HeвЂ™d
like
that
as
much
as
Asha
would.

He
sent
for
Kyra,
kicked
shut
the
door,
climbed
on
top
of
her,
and
fucked
the
wench
with
a
fury
heвЂ™d
never
known
was
in
him,
By
the
time
he
finished,
she
was
sobbing,
her
neck
and
breasts
covered
with
bruises
and
bite
marks.
Theon
shoved
her
from
the
bed
and
threw
her
a
blanket.
вЂњGet
out.вЂќ

Yet
even
then,
he
could
not
sleep.

Come
dawn,
he
dressed
and
went
outside,
to
walk
along
the
outer
walls.
A
brisk
autumn
wind
was
swirling
through
the
battlements.
It
reddened
his
cheeks
and
stung
his
eyes.
He
watched
the
forest
go
from
grey
to
green
below
him
as
light
filtered
through
the
silent
trees.
On
his
left
he
could
see
tower
tops
above
the
inner
wall,
their
roofs
gilded
by
the
rising
sun.
The
red
leaves
of
the
weirwood
were
a
blaze
of
flame
among
the
green.
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
tree,
he
thought,
and
StarkвЂ™s
wood,
StarkвЂ™s
castle,
StarkвЂ™s
sword,
StarkвЂ™s
gods.
This
is
their
place,
not
mine.
I
am
a
Greyjoy
of
Pyke,
born
to
paint
a
kraken
on
my
shield
and
sail
the
great
salt
sea.
I
should
have
gone
with
Asha.

On
their
iron
spikes
atop
the
gatehouse,
the
heads
waited.

Theon
gazed
at
them
silently
while
the
wind
tugged
on
his
cloak
with
small
ghostly
hands.
The
millerвЂ™s
boys
had
been
of
an
age
with
Bran
and
Rickon,
alike
in
size
and
coloring,
and
once
Reek
had
flayed
the
skin
from
their
faces
and
dipped
their
heads
in
tar,
it
was
easy
to
see
familiar
features
in
those
misshapen
lumps
of
rotting
flesh.
People
were
such
fools.
If
weвЂ™d
said
they
were
ramsвЂ™
heads,
they
would
have
seen
horns.





SANSA

They
had
been
singing
in
the
sept
all
morning,
since
the
first
report
of
enemy
sails
had
reached
the
castle.
The
sound
of
their
voices
mingled
with
the
whicker
of
horses,
the
clank
of
steel,
and
the
groaning
hinges
of
the
great
bronze
gates
to
make
a
strange
and
fearful
music.
In
the
sept
they
sing
for
the
MotherвЂ™s
mercy
but
on
the
walls
itвЂ™s
the
Warrior
they
pray
to,
and
all
in
silence.
She
remembered
how
Septa
Mordane
used
to
tell
them
that
the
Warrior
and
the
Mother
were
only
two
faces
of
the
same
great
god.
But
if
there
is
only
one,
whose
prayers
will
be
heard?

Ser
Meryn
Trant
held
the
blood
bay
for
Joffrey
to
mount.
Boy
and
horse
alike
wore
gilded
mail
and
enameled
crimson
plate,
with
matching
golden
lions
on
their
heads.
The
pale
sunlight
flashed
off
the
golds
and
reds
every
time
Joff
moved.
Bright,
shining,
and
empty,
Sansa
thought.

The
Imp
was
mounted
on
a
red
stallion,
armored
more
plainly
than
the
king
in
battle
gear
that
made
him
look
like
a
little
boy
dressed
up
in
his
fatherвЂ™s
clothes.
But
there
was
nothing
childish
about
the
battle-axe
slung
below
his
shield.
Ser
Mandon
Moore
rode
at
his
side,
white
steel
icy
bright.
When
Tyrion
saw
her
he
turned
his
horse
her
way.
вЂњLady
Sansa,вЂќ
he
called
from
the
saddle,
вЂњsurely
my
sister
has
asked
you
to
join
the
other
highborn
ladies
in
MaegorвЂ™s?вЂќ

вЂњShe
has,
my
lord,
but
King
Joffrey
sent
for
me
to
see
him
off.
I
mean
to
visit
the
sept
as
well,
to
pray.вЂќ

вЂњI
wonвЂ™t
ask
for
whom.вЂќ
His
mouth
twisted
oddly;
if
that
was
a
smile,
it
was
the
queerest
she
had
ever
seen.
вЂњThis
day
may
change
all.
For
you
as
well
as
for
House
Lannister.
I
ought
to
have
sent
you
off
with
Tommen,
now
that
I
think
on
it.
Still,
you
should
be
safe
enough
in
MaegorвЂ™s,
so
long
asвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSansa!вЂќ
The
boyish
shout
rang
across
the
yard;
Joffrey
had
seen
her.
вЂњSansa,
here!вЂќ

He
calls
me
as
if
he
were
calling
a
dog,
she
thought.

вЂњHis
Grace
has
need
of
you,вЂќ
Tyrion
Lannister
observed.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
talk
again
after
the
battle,
if
the
gods
permit.вЂќ

Sansa
threaded
her
way
through
the
file
of
gold-cloaked
spearmen
as
Joffrey
beckoned
her
closer.
вЂњIt
will
be
battle
soon,
everyone
says
so.вЂќ

вЂњMay
the
gods
have
mercy
on
us
all.вЂќ

вЂњMy
uncleвЂ™s
the
one
who
will
need
mercy,
but
I
wonвЂ™t
give
him
any.вЂќ
Joffrey
drew
his
sword.
The
pommel
was
a
ruby
cut
in
the
shape
of
a
heart,
set
between
a
lionвЂ™s
jaws.
Three
fullers
were
deeply
incised
in
the
blade.
вЂњMy
new
blade,
Hearteater.вЂќ

HeвЂ™d
owned
a
sword
named
LionвЂ™s
Tooth
once,
Sansa
remembered.
Arya
had
taken
it
from
him
and
thrown
it
in
a
river.
I
hope
Stannis
does
the
same
with
this
one.
вЂњIt
is
beautifully
wrought,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњBless
my
steel
with
a
kiss.вЂќ
He
extended
the
blade
down
to
her.
вЂњGo
on,
kiss
it.вЂќ

He
had
never
sounded
more
like
a
stupid
little
boy.
Sansa
touched
her
lips
to
the
metal,
thinking
that
she
would
kiss
any
number
of
swords
sooner
than
Joffrey.
The
gesture
seemed
to
please
him,
though.
He
sheathed
the
blade
with
a
flourish.
вЂњYouвЂ™ll
kiss
it
again
when
I
return,
and
taste
my
uncleвЂ™s
blood.вЂќ

Only
if
one
of
your
Kingsguard
kills
him
for
you.
Three
of
the
White
Swords
would
go
with
Joffrey
and
his
uncle:
Ser
Meryn,
Ser
Mandon,
and
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack.
вЂњWill
you
lead
your
knights
into
battle?вЂќ
Sansa
asked,
hoping.

вЂњI
would,
but
my
uncle
the
Imp
says
my
uncle
Stannis
will
never
cross
the
river.
IвЂ™ll
command
the
Three
Whores,
though.
IвЂ™m
going
to
see
to
the
traitors
myself.вЂќ
The
prospect
made
Joff
smile.
His
plump
pink
lips
always
made
him
look
pouty.
Sansa
had
liked
that
once,
but
now
it
made
her
sick.

вЂњThey
say
my
brother
Robb
always
goes
where
the
fighting
is
thickest,вЂќ
she
said
recklessly.
вЂњThough
heвЂ™s
older
than
Your
Grace,
to
be
sure.
A
man
grown.вЂќ

That
made
him
frown.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
deal
with
your
brother
after
IвЂ™m
done
with
my
traitor
uncle.
IвЂ™ll
gut
him
with
Hearteater,
youвЂ™ll
see.вЂќ
He
wheeled
his
horse
about
and
spurred
toward
the
gate.
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Osmund
fell
in
to
his
right
and
left,
the
gold
cloaks
following
four
abreast.
The
Imp
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
brought
up
the
rear.
The
guards
saw
them
off
with
off
with
shouts
and
cheers.
When
the
last
was
gone,
a
sudden
stillness
settled
over
the
yard,
like
the
hush
before
a
storm.

Through
the
quiet,
the
singing
pulled
at
her.
Sansa
turned
toward
the
sept.
Two
stableboys
followed,
and
one
of
the
guards
whose
watch
was
ended.
Others
fell
in
behind
them.

Sansa
had
never
seen
the
sept
so
crowded,
nor
so
brightly
lit;
great
shafts
of
rainbow-colored
sunlight
slanted
down
through
the
crystals
in
the
high
windows,
and
candles
burned
on
every
side,
their
little
flames
twinkling
like
stars.
The
MotherвЂ™s
altar
and
the
WarriorвЂ™s
swam
in
light,
but
Smith
and
Crone
and
Maid
and
Father
had
their
worshipers
as
well,
and
there
were
even
a
few
flames
dancing
below
the
StrangerвЂ™s
half-human
faceвЂ¦
for
what
was
Stannis
Baratheon,
if
not
the
Stranger
come
to
judge
them?
Sansa
visited
each
of
the
Seven
in
turn,
lighting
a
candle
at
each
altar,
and
then
found
herself
a
place
on
the
benches
between
a
wizened
old
washer
woman
and
a
boy
no
older
than
Rickon,
dressed
in
the
fine
linen
tunic
of
a
knightвЂ™s
son.
The
old
womanвЂ™s
hand
was
bony
and
hard
with
callus,
the
boyвЂ™s
small
and
soft,
but
it
was
good
to
have
someone
to
hold
on
to.
The
air
was
hot
and
heavy,
smelling
of
incense
and
sweat,
crystal-kissed
and
candle-bright;
it
made
her
dizzy
to
breathe
it.

She
knew
the
hymn;
her
mother
had
taught
it
to
her
once,
a
long
time
ago
in
Winterfell.
She
joined
her
voice
to
theirs.

Gentle
Mother,
font
of
mercy,

save
our
sons
from
war,
we
pray,

stay
the
swords
and
stay
the
arrows,

let
them
know
a
better
day.

Gentle
Mother,
strength
of
women,

help
our
daughters
through
this
fray,

soothe
the
wrath
and
tame
the
fury,

teach
us
all
a
kinder
way.

Across
the
city,
thousands
had
jammed
into
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
VisenyaвЂ™s
Hill,
and
they
would
be
singing
too,
their
voices
swelling
out
over
the
city,
across
the
river,
and
up
into
the
sky.
Surely
the
gods
must
hear
us,
she
thought.

Sansa
knew
most
of
the
hymns,
and
followed
along
on
those
she
did
not
know
as
best
she
could.
She
sang
along
with
grizzled
old
serving
men
and
anxious
young
wives,
with
serving
girls
and
soldiers,
cooks
and
falconers,
knights
and
knaves,
squires
and
spit
boys
and
nursing
mothers.
She
sang
with
those
inside
the
castle
walls
and
those
without,
sang
with
all
the
city.
She
sang
for
mercy,
for
the
living
and
the
dead
alike,
for
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb,
for
her
sister
Arya
and
her
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow,
away
off
on
the
Wall.
She
sang
for
her
mother
and
her
father,
for
her
grandfather
Lord
Hoster
and
her
uncle
Edmure
Tully,
for
her
friend
Jeyne
Poole,
for
old
drunken
King
Robert,
for
Septa
Mordane
and
Ser
Dontos
and
Jory
Cassel
and
Maester
Luwin,
for
all
the
brave
knights
and
soldiers
who
would
die
today,
and
for
the
children
and
the
wives
who
would
mourn
them,
and
finally,
toward
the
end,
she
even
sang
for
Tyrion
the
Imp
and
for
the
Hound.
He
is
no
true
knight
but
he
saved
me
all
the
same,
she
told
the
Mother.
Save
him
if
you
can,
and
gentle
the
rage
inside
him.

But
when
the
septon
climbed
on
high
and
called
upon
the
gods
to
protect
and
defend
their
true
and
noble
king,
Sansa
got
to
her
feet.
The
aisles
were
jammed
with
people.
She
had
to
shoulder
through
while
the
septon
called
upon
the
Smith
to
lend
strength
to
JoffreyвЂ™s
sword
and
shield,
the
Warrior
to
give
him
courage,
the
Father
to
defend
him
in
his
need.
Let
his
sword
break
and
his
shield
shatter,
Sansa
thought
coldly
as
she
shoved
out
through
the
doors,
let
his
courage
fail
him
and
every
man
desert
him.

A
few
guards
paced
along
on
the
gatehouse
battlements,
but
otherwise
the
castle
seemed
empty.
Sansa
stopped
and
listened.
Away
off,
she
could
hear
the
sounds
of
battle.
The
singing
almost
drowned
them
out,
but
the
sounds
were
there
if
you
had
the
ears
to
hear:
the
deep
moan
of
warhorns,
the
creak
and
thud
of
catapults
flinging
stones,
the
splashes
and
splinterings,
the
crackle
of
burning
pitch
and
thrum
of
scorpions
loosing
their
yard-long
iron-headed
shaftsвЂ¦
and
beneath
it
all,
the
cries
of
dying
men.

It
was
another
sort
of
song,
a
terrible
song.
Sansa
pulled
the
hood
of
her
cloak
up
over
her
ears,
and
hurried
toward
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast,
the
castle-within-a-castle
where
the
queen
had
promised
they
would
all
be
safe.
At
the
foot
of
the
drawbridge,
she
came
upon
Lady
Tanda
and
her
two
daughters.
Falyse
had
arrived
yesterday
from
Castle
Stokeworth
with
a
small
troop
of
soldiers.
She
was
trying
to
coax
her
sister
onto
the
bridge,
but
Lollys
clung
to
her
maid,
sobbing,
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to,
I
donвЂ™t
want
to,
I
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ

вЂњThe
battle
is
begun,вЂќ
Lady
Tanda
said
in
a
brittle
voice.

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to,
I
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ

There
was
no
way
Sansa
could
avoid
them.
She
greeted
them
courteously.
вЂњMay
I
be
of
help?вЂќ

Lady
Tanda
flushed
with
shame.
вЂњNo,
my
lady,
but
we
thank
you
kindly.
You
must
forgive
my
daughter,
she
has
not
been
well.вЂќ

вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ
Lollys
clutched
at
her
maid,
a
slender,
pretty
girl
with
short
dark
hair
who
looked
as
though
she
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
shove
her
mistress
into
the
dry
moat,
onto
those
iron
spikes.
вЂњPlease,
please,
I
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ

Sansa
spoke
to
her
gently.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
all
be
thrice
protected
inside,
and
thereвЂ™s
to
be
food
and
drink
and
song
as
well.вЂќ

Lollys
gaped
at
her,
mouth
open.
She
had
dull
brown
eyes
that
always
seemed
to
be
wet
with
tears.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
want
to.вЂќ

вЂњYou
have
to,вЂќ
her
sister
Falyse
said
sharply,
вЂњand
that
is
the
end
of
it.
Shae,
help
me.вЂќ
They
each
took
an
elbow,
and
together
half
dragged
and
half
carried
Lollys
across
the
bridge.
Sansa
followed
with
their
mother.
вЂњSheвЂ™s
been
sick,вЂќ
Lady
Tanda
said.
If
a
babe
can
be
termed
a
sickness,
Sansa
thought.
It
was
common
gossip
that
Lollys
was
with
child.

The
two
guards
at
the
door
wore
the
lion-crested
helms
and
crimson
cloaks
of
House
Lannister,
but
Sansa
knew
they
were
only
dressed-up
sellswords.
Another
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
stairвЂ”a
real
guard
would
have
been
standing,
not
sitting
on
a
step
with
his
halberd
across
his
kneesвЂ”but
he
rose
when
he
saw
them
and
opened
the
door
to
usher
them
inside.

The
QueenвЂ™s
Ballroom
was
not
a
tenth
the
size
of
the
castleвЂ™s
Great
Hall,
only
half
as
big
as
the
Small
Hall
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
it
could
still
seat
a
hundred,
and
it
made
up
in
grace
what
it
lacked
in
space.
Beaten
silver
mirrors
backed
every
wall
sconce,
so
the
torches
burned
twice
as
bright;
the
walls
were
paneled
in
richly
carved
wood,
and
sweet-smelling
rushes
covered
the
floors.
From
the
gallery
above
drifted
down
the
merry
strains
of
pipes
and
fiddle.
A
line
of
arched
windows
ran
along
the
south
wall,
but
they
had
been
closed
off
with
heavy
draperies.
Thick
velvet
hangings
admitted
no
thread
of
light,
and
would
muffle
the
sound
of
prayer
and
war
alike.
It
makes
no
matter,
Sansa
thought.
The
war
is
with
us.

Almost
every
highborn
woman
in
the
city
sat
at
the
long
trestle
tables,
along
with
a
handful
of
old
men
and
young
boys.
The
women
were
wives,
daughters,
mothers,
and
sisters.
Their
men
had
gone
out
to
fight
Lord
Stannis.
Many
would
not
return.
The
air
was
heavy
with
the
knowledge.
As
JoffreyвЂ™s
betrothed,
Sansa
had
the
seat
of
honor
on
the
queenвЂ™s
right
hand.
She
was
climbing
the
dais
when
she
saw
the
man
standing
in
the
shadows
by
the
back
wall.
He
wore
a
long
hauberk
of
oiled
black
mail,
and
held
his
sword
before
him:
her
fatherвЂ™s
greatsword,
Ice,
near
as
tall
as
he
was.
Its
point
rested
on
the
floor,
and
his
hard
bony
fingers
curled
around
the
crossguard
on
either
side
of
the
grip.
SansaвЂ™s
breath
caught
in
her
throat.
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
seemed
to
sense
her
stare.
He
turned
his
gaunt,
pox-ravaged
face
toward
her.

вЂњWhat
is
he
doing
here?вЂќ
she
asked
Osfryd
Kettleblack.
He
captained
the
queenвЂ™s
new
red
cloak
guard.

Osfryd
grinned.
вЂњHer
Grace
expects
sheвЂ™ll
have
need
of
him
before
the
nightвЂ™s
done.вЂќ

Ser
Ilyn
was
the
KingвЂ™s
Justice.
There
was
only
one
service
he
might
be
needed
for.
Whose
head
does
she
want?

вЂњAll
rise
for
Her
Grace,
Cersei
of
House
Lannister,
Queen
Regent
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,вЂќ
the
royal
steward
cried.

CerseiвЂ™s
gown
was
snowy
linen,
white
as
the
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard.
Her
long
dagged
sleeves
showed
a
lining
of
gold
satin.
Masses
of
bright
yellow
hair
tumbled
to
her
bare
shoulders
in
thick
curls.
Around
her
slender
neck
hung
a
rope
of
diamonds
and
emeralds.
The
white
made
her
look
strangely
innocent,
almost
maidenly,
but
there
were
points
of
color
on
her
cheeks.

вЂњBe
seated,вЂќ
the
queen
said
when
she
had
taken
her
place
on
the
dais,
вЂњand
be
welcome.вЂќ
Osfryd
Kettleblack
held
her
chair;
a
page
performed
the
same
service
for
Sansa.
вЂњYou
look
pale,
Sansa,вЂќ
Cersei
observed.
вЂњIs
your
red
flower
still
blooming?вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ

вЂњHow
apt.
The
men
will
bleed
out
there,
and
you
in
here.вЂќ
The
queen
signaled
for
the
first
course
to
be
served.

вЂњWhy
is
Ser
Ilyn
here?вЂќ
Sansa
blurted
out.

The
queen
glanced
at
the
mute
headsman.
вЂњTo
deal
with
treason,
and
to
defend
us
if
need
be.
He
was
a
knight
before
he
was
a
headsman.вЂќ
She
pointed
her
spoon
toward
the
end
of
the
hall,
where
the
tall
wooden
doors
had
been
closed
and
barred.
вЂњWhen
the
axes
smash
down
those
doors,
you
may
be
glad
of
him.вЂќ

I
would
be
gladder
if
it
were
the
Hound,
Sansa
thought.
Harsh
as
he
was,
she
did
not
believe
Sandor
Clegane
would
let
any
harm
come
to
her.
вЂњWonвЂ™t
your
guards
protect
us?вЂќ

вЂњAnd
who
will
protect
us
from
my
guards?вЂќ
The
queen
gave
Osfryd
a
sideways
look.
вЂњLoyal
sellswords
are
rare
as
virgin
whores.
If
the
battle
is
lost
my
guards
will
trip
on
those
crimson
cloaks
in
their
haste
to
rip
them
off.
TheyвЂ™ll
steal
what
they
can
and
flee,
along
with
the
serving
men,
washer
women,
and
stableboys,
all
out
to
save
their
own
worthless
hides.
Do
you
have
any
notion
what
happens
when
a
city
is
sacked,
Sansa?
No,
you
wouldnвЂ™t,
would
you?
All
you
know
of
life
you
learned
from
singers,
and
thereвЂ™s
such
a
dearth
of
good
sacking
songs.вЂќ

вЂњTrue
knights
would
never
harm
women
and
children.вЂќ
The
words
rang
hollow
in
her
ears
even
as
she
said
them.

вЂњTrue
knights.вЂќ
The
queen
seemed
to
find
that
wonderfully
amusing.
вЂњNo
doubt
youвЂ™re
right.
So
why
donвЂ™t
you
just
eat
your
broth
like
a
good
girl
and
wait
for
Symeon
Star-Eyes
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
to
come
rescue
you,
sweetling.
IвЂ™m
sure
it
wonвЂ™t
be
very
long
now.вЂќ





DAVOS

Blackwater
Bay
was
rough
and
choppy,
whitecaps
everywhere.
Black
Betha
rode
the
flood
tide,
her
sail
cracking
and
snapping
at
each
shift
of
wind.
Wraith
and
Lady
Marya
sailed
beside
her,
no
more
than
twenty
yards
between
their
hulls.
His
sons
could
keep
a
line.
Davos
took
pride
in
that.

Across
the
sea
warhorns
boomed,
deep
throaty
moans
like
the
calls
of
monstrous
serpents,
repeated
ship
to
ship.
вЂњBring
down
the
sail,вЂќ
Davos
commanded.
вЂњLower
mast.
Oarsmen
to
your
oars.вЂќ
His
son
Matthos
relayed
the
commands.
The
deck
of
Black
Betha
churned
as
crewmen
ran
to
their
tasks,
pushing
through
the
soldiers
who
always
seemed
to
be
in
the
way
no
matter
where
they
stood.
Ser
Imry
had
decreed
that
they
would
enter
the
river
on
oars
alone,
so
as
not
to
expose
their
sails
to
the
scorpions
and
spitfires
on
the
walls
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.

Davos
could
make
out
Fury
well
to
the
southeast,
her
sails
shimmering
golden
as
they
came
down,
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
blazoned
on
the
canvas.
From
her
decks
Stannis
Baratheon
had
commanded
the
assault
on
Dragonstone
sixteen
years
before,
but
this
time
he
had
chosen
to
ride
with
his
army,
trusting
Fury
and
the
command
of
his
fleet
to
his
wifeвЂ™s
brother
Ser
Imry,
whoвЂ™d
come
over
to
his
cause
at
StormвЂ™s
End
with
Lord
Alester
and
all
the
other
Florents.

Davos
knew
Fury
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
ships.
Above
her
three
hundred
oars
was
a
deck
given
over
wholly
to
scorpions,
and
topside
she
mounted
catapults
fore
and
aft,
large
enough
to
fling
barrels
of
burning
pitch.
A
most
formidable
ship,
and
very
swift
as
well,
although
Ser
Imry
had
packed
her
bow
to
stern
with
armored
knights
and
men-at-arms,
at
some
cost
to
her
speed.

The
warhorns
sounded
again,
commands
drifting
back
from
the
Fury.
Davos
felt
a
tingle
in
his
missing
fingertips.
вЂњOut
oars,вЂќ
he
shouted.
вЂњForm
line.вЂќ
A
hundred
blades
dipped
down
into
the
water
as
the
oarmasterвЂ™s
drum
began
to
boom.
The
sound
was
like
the
beating
of
a
great
slow
heart,
and
the
oars
moved
at
every
stroke,
a
hundred
men
pulling
as
one.

Wooden
wings
had
sprouted
from
the
Wraith
and
Lady
Marya
as
well.
The
three
galleys
kept
pace,
their
blades
churning
the
water.
вЂњSlow
cruise,вЂќ
Davos
called.
Lord
VelaryonвЂ™s
silver-hulled
Pride
of
Driftmark
had
moved
into
her
position
to
port
of
Wraith,
and
Bold
Laughter
was
coming
up
fast,
but
Harridan
was
only
now
getting
her
oars
into
the
water
and
Seahorse
was
still
struggling
to
bring
down
her
mast.
Davos
looked
astern.
Yes,
there,
far
to
the
south,
that
could
only
be
Swordfish,
lagging
as
ever.
She
dipped
two
hundred
oars
and
mounted
the
largest
ram
in
the
fleet,
though
Davos
had
grave
doubts
about
her
captain.

He
could
hear
soldiers
shouting
encouragement
to
each
other
across
the
water.
TheyвЂ™d
been
little
more
than
ballast
since
StormвЂ™s
End,
and
were
eager
to
get
at
the
foe,
confident
of
victory.
In
that,
they
were
of
one
mind
with
their
admiral,
Lord
High
Captain
Ser
Imry
Florent.

Three
days
past,
he
had
summoned
all
his
captains
to
a
war
council
aboard
the
Fury
while
the
fleet
lay
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
the
Wendwater,
in
order
to
acquaint
them
with
his
dispositions.
Davos
and
his
sons
had
been
assigned
a
place
in
the
second
line
of
battle,
well
out
on
the
dangerous
starboard
wing.
вЂњA
place
of
honor,вЂќ
Allard
had
declared,
well
satisfied
with
the
chance
to
prove
his
valor.
вЂњA
place
of
peril,вЂќ
his
father
had
pointed
out.
His
sons
had
given
him
pitying
looks,
even
young
Maric.
The
Onion
Knight
has
become
an
old
woman,
he
could
hear
them
thinking,
still
a
smuggler
at
heart.

Well,
the
last
was
true
enough,
he
would
make
no
apologies
for
it.
Seaworth
had
a
lordly
ring
to
it,
but
down
deep
he
was
still
Davos
of
Flea
Bottom,
coming
home
to
his
city
on
its
three
high
hills.
He
knew
as
much
of
ships
and
sails
and
shores
as
any
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
had
fought
his
share
of
desperate
fights
sword
to
sword
on
a
wet
deck.
But
to
this
sort
of
battle
he
came
a
maiden,
nervous
and
afraid.
Smugglers
do
not
sound
warhorns
and
raise
banners.
When
they
smell
danger,
they
raise
sail
and
run
before
the
wind.

Had
he
been
admiral,
he
might
have
done
it
all
differently.
For
a
start,
he
would
have
sent
a
few
of
his
swiftest
ships
to
probe
upriver
and
see
what
awaited
them,
instead
of
smashing
in
headlong.
When
he
had
suggested
as
much
to
Ser
Imry,
the
Lord
High
Captain
had
thanked
him
courteously,
but
his
eyes
were
not
as
polite.
Who
is
this
lowborn
craven?
those
eyes
asked.
Is
he
the
one
who
bought
his
knighthood
with
an
onion?

With
four
times
as
many
ships
as
the
boy
king,
Ser
Imry
saw
no
need
for
caution
or
deceptive
tactics.
He
had
organized
the
fleet
into
ten
lines
of
battle,
each
of
twenty
ships.
The
first
two
lines
would
sweep
up
the
river
to
engage
and
destroy
JoffreyвЂ™s
little
fleet,
or
вЂњthe
boyвЂ™s
toysвЂќ
as
Ser
Imry
dubbed
them,
to
the
mirth
of
his
lordly
captains.
Those
that
followed
would
land
companies
of
archers
and
spearmen
beneath
the
city
walls,
and
only
then
join
the
fight
on
the
river.
The
smaller,
slower
ships
to
the
rear
would
ferry
over
the
main
part
of
StannisвЂ™s
host
from
the
south
bank,
protected
by
Salladhor
Saan
and
his
Lyseni,
who
would
stand
out
in
the
bay
in
case
the
Lannisters
had
other
ships
hidden
up
along
the
coast,
poised
to
sweep
down
on
their
rear.

To
be
fair,
there
was
reason
for
Ser
ImryвЂ™s
haste.
The
winds
had
not
used
them
kindly
on
the
voyage
up
from
StormвЂ™s
End.
They
had
lost
two
cogs
to
the
rocks
of
Shipbreaker
Bay
on
the
very
day
they
set
sail,
a
poor
way
to
begin.
One
of
the
Myrish
galleys
had
foundered
in
the
Straits
of
Tarth,
and
a
storm
had
overtaken
them
as
they
were
entering
the
Gullet,
scattering
the
fleet
across
half
the
narrow
sea.
All
but
twelve
ships
had
finally
regrouped
behind
the
sheltering
spine
of
MasseyвЂ™s
Hook,
in
the
calmer
waters
of
Blackwater
Bay,
but
not
before
they
had
lost
considerable
time.

Stannis
would
have
reached
the
Rush
days
ago.
The
kingsroad
ran
from
StormвЂ™s
End
straight
to
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
a
much
shorter
route
than
by
sea,
and
his
host
was
largely
mounted;
near
twenty
thousand
knights,
light
horse,
and
freeriders,
RenlyвЂ™s
unwilling
legacy
to
his
brother.
They
would
have
made
good
time,
but
armored
destriers
and
twelve-foot
lances
would
avail
them
little
against
the
deep
waters
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
and
the
high
stone
walls
of
the
city.
Stannis
would
be
camped
with
his
lords
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river,
doubtless
seething
with
impatience
and
wondering
what
Ser
Imry
had
done
with
his
fleet.

Off
Merling
Rock
two
days
before,
they
had
sighted
a
half-dozen
fishing
skiffs.
The
fisherfolk
had
fled
before
them,
but
one
by
one
they
had
been
overtaken
and
boarded.
вЂњA
small
spoon
of
victory
is
just
the
thing
to
settle
the
stomach
before
battle,вЂќ
Ser
Imry
had
declared
happily.
вЂњIt
makes
the
men
hungry
for
a
larger
helping.вЂќ
But
Davos
had
been
more
interested
in
what
the
captives
had
to
say
about
the
defenses
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
The
dwarf
had
been
busy
building
some
sort
of
boom
to
close
off
the
mouth
of
the
river,
though
the
fishermen
differed
as
to
whether
the
work
had
been
completed
or
not.
He
found
himself
wishing
it
had.
If
the
river
was
closed
to
them,
Ser
Imry
would
have
no
choice
but
to
pause
and
take
stock.

The
sea
was
full
of
sound:
shouts
and
calls,
warhorns
and
drums
and
the
trill
of
pipes,
the
slap
of
wood
on
water
as
thousands
of
oars
rose
and
fell.
вЂњKeep
line,вЂќ
Davos
shouted.
A
gust
of
wind
tugged
at
his
old
green
cloak.
A
jerkin
of
boiled
leather
and
a
pothelm
at
his
feet
were
his
only
armor.
At
sea,
heavy
steel
was
as
like
to
cost
a
man
his
life
as
to
save
it,
he
believed.
Ser
Imry
and
the
other
highborn
captains
did
not
share
his
view;
they
glittered
as
they
paced
their
decks.

Harridan
and
Seahorse
had
slipped
into
their
places
now,
and
Lord
CeltigarвЂ™s
Red
Claw
beyond
them.
To
starboard
of
AllardвЂ™s
Lady
Marya
were
the
three
galleys
that
Stannis
had
seized
from
the
unfortunate
Lord
Sunglass,
Piety,
Prayer,
and
Devotion,
their
decks
crawling
with
archers.
Even
Swordfish
was
closing,
lumbering
and
rolling
through
a
thickening
sea
under
both
oars
and
sail.
A
ship
of
that
many
oars
ought
to
be
much
faster,
Davos
reflected
with
disapproval.
ItвЂ™s
that
ram
she
carries,
itвЂ™s
too
big,
she
has
no
balance.

The
wind
was
gusting
from
the
south,
but
under
oars
it
made
no
matter.
They
would
be
sweeping
in
on
the
flood
tide,
but
the
Lannisters
would
have
the
river
current
to
their
favor,
and
the
Blackwater
Rush
flowed
strong
and
swift
where
it
met
the
sea.
The
first
shock
would
inevitably
favor
the
foe.
We
are
fools
to
meet
them
on
the
Blackwater,
Davos
thought.
In
any
encounter
on
the
open
sea,
their
battle
lines
would
envelop
the
enemy
fleet
on
both
flanks,
driving
them
inward
to
destruction.
On
the
river,
though,
the
numbers
and
weight
of
Ser
ImryвЂ™s
ships
would
count
for
less.
They
could
not
dress
more
than
twenty
ships
abreast,
lest
they
risk
tangling
their
oars
and
colliding
with
each
other.

Beyond
the
line
of
warships,
Davos
could
see
the
Red
Keep
up
on
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill,
dark
against
a
lemon
sky,
with
the
mouth
of
the
Rush
opening
out
below.
Across
the
river
the
south
shore
was
black
with
men
and
horses,
stirring
like
angry
ants
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
approaching
ships.
Stannis
would
have
kept
them
busy
building
rafts
and
fletching
arrows,
yet
even
so
the
waiting
would
have
been
a
hard
thing
to
bear.
Trumpets
sounded
from
among
them,
tiny
and
brazen,
soon
swallowed
by
the
roar
of
a
thousand
shouts.
Davos
closed
his
stubby
hand
around
the
pouch
that
held
his
fingerbones,
and
mouthed
a
silent
prayer
for
luck.

Fury
herself
would
center
the
first
line
of
battle,
flanked
by
the
Lord
Steffon
and
the
Stag
of
the
Sea,
each
of
two
hundred
oars.
On
the
port
and
starboard
wings
were
the
hundreds:
Lady
Harra,
Brightfish,
Laughing
Lord,
Sea
Demon,
Horned
Honor,
Ragged
Jenna,
Trident
Three,
Swift
Sword,
Princess
Rhaenys,
DogвЂ™s
Nose,
Sceptre,
Faithful,
Red
Raven,
Queen
Alysanne,
Cat,
Courageous,
and
Dragonsbane.
From
every
stern
streamed
the
fiery
heart
of
the
Lord
of
Light,
red
and
yellow
and
orange.
Behind
Davos
and
his
sons
came
another
line
of
hundreds
commanded
by
knights
and
lordly
captains,
and
then
the
smaller,
slower
Myrish
contingent,
none
dipping
more
than
eighty
oars.
Farther
back
would
come
the
sailed
ships,
carracks
and
lumbering
great
cogs,
and
last
of
all
Salladhor
Saan
in
his
proud
Valyrian,
a
towering
three-hundred,
paced
by
the
rest
of
his
galleys
with
their
distinctive
striped
hulls.
The
flamboyant
Lyseni
princeling
had
not
been
pleased
to
be
assigned
the
rear
guard,
but
it
was
clear
that
Ser
Imry
trusted
him
no
more
than
Stannis
did.
Too
many
complaints,
and
too
much
talk
of
the
gold
he
was
owed.
Davos
was
sorry
nonetheless.
Salladhor
Saan
was
a
resourceful
old
pirate,
and
his
crews
were
born
seamen,
fearless
in
a
fight.
They
were
wasted
in
the
rear.

Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
The
call
rolled
across
whitecaps
and
churning
oars
from
the
forecastle
of
the
Fury:
Ser
Imry
was
sounding
the
attack.
Ahoooooooooooooooooooo,
ahooooooooooooooooooooo.

Swordfish
had
joined
the
line
at
last,
though
she
still
had
her
sail
raised.
вЂњFast
cruise,вЂќ
Davos
barked.
The
drum
began
to
beat
more
quickly,
and
the
stroke
picked
up,
the
blades
of
the
oars
cutting
water,
splash-swoosh,
splash-swoosh,
splash-swoosh.
On
deck,
soldiers
banged
sword
against
shield,
while
archers
quietly
strung
their
bows
and
pulled
the
first
arrow
from
the
quivers
at
their
belts.
The
galleys
of
the
first
line
of
battle
obscured
his
vision,
so
Davos
paced
the
deck
searching
for
a
better
view.
He
saw
no
sign
of
any
boom;
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
open,
as
if
to
swallow
them
all.
ExceptвЂ¦

In
his
smuggling
days,
Davos
had
often
jested
that
he
knew
the
waterfront
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing
a
deal
better
than
the
back
of
his
hand,
since
he
had
not
spent
a
good
part
of
his
life
sneaking
in
and
out
of
the
back
of
his
hand.
The
squat
towers
of
raw
new
stone
that
stood
opposite
one
another
at
the
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
might
mean
nothing
to
Ser
Imry
Florent,
but
to
him
it
was
as
if
two
extra
fingers
had
sprouted
from
his
knuckles.

Shading
his
eyes
against
the
westering
sun,
he
peered
at
those
towers
more
closely.
They
were
too
small
to
hold
much
of
a
garrison.
The
one
on
the
north
bank
was
built
against
the
bluff
with
the
Red
Keep
frowning
above;
its
counterpart
on
the
south
shore
had
its
footing
in
the
water.
They
dug
a
cut
through
the
bank,
he
knew
at
once.
That
would
make
the
tower
very
difficult
to
assault;
attackers
would
need
to
wade
through
the
water
or
bridge
the
little
channel.
Stannis
had
posted
bowmen
below,
to
fire
up
at
the
defenders
whenever
one
was
rash
enough
to
lift
his
head
above
the
ramparts,
but
otherwise
had
not
troubled.

Something
flashed
down
low
where
the
dark
water
swirled
around
the
base
of
the
tower.
It
was
sunlight
on
steel,
and
it
told
Davos
Seaworth
all
he
needed
to
know.
A
chain
boomвЂ¦
and
yet
they
have
not
closed
the
river
against
us.
Why?

He
could
make
a
guess
at
that
as
well,
but
there
was
no
time
to
consider
the
question.
A
shout
went
up
from
the
ships
ahead,
and
the
warhorns
blew
again:
the
enemy
was
before
them.

Between
the
flashing
oars
of
Sceptre
and
Faithful,
Davos
saw
a
thin
line
of
galleys
drawn
across
the
river,
the
sun
glinting
off
the
gold
paint
that
marked
their
hulls.
He
knew
those
ships
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own.
When
he
had
been
a
smuggler,
heвЂ™d
always
felt
safer
knowing
whether
the
sail
on
the
horizon
marked
a
fast
ship
or
a
slow
one,
and
whether
her
captain
was
a
young
man
hungry
for
glory
or
an
old
one
serving
out
his
days.

Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooooo,
the
warhorns
called.
вЂњBattle
speed,вЂќ
Davos
shouted.
On
port
and
starboard
he
heard
Dale
and
Allard
giving
the
same
command.
Drums
began
to
beat
furiously,
oars
rose
and
fell,
and
Black
Betha
surged
forward.
When
he
glanced
toward
Wraith,
Dale
gave
him
a
salute.
Swordfish
was
lagging
once
more,
wallowing
in
the
wake
of
the
smaller
ships
to
either
side;
elsewise
the
line
was
straight
as
a
shield
wall.

The
river
that
had
seemed
so
narrow
from
a
distance
now
stretched
wide
as
a
sea,
but
the
city
had
grown
gigantic
as
well.
Glowering
down
from
AegonвЂ™s
High
Hill,
the
Red
Keep
commanded
the
approaches.
Its
iron-crowned
battlements,
massive
towers,
and
thick
red
walls
gave
it
the
aspect
of
a
ferocious
beast
hunched
above
river
and
streets.
The
bluffs
on
which
it
crouched
were
steep
and
rocky,
spotted
with
lichen
and
gnarled
thorny
trees.
The
fleet
would
have
to
pass
below
the
castle
to
reach
the
harbor
and
city
beyond.

The
first
line
was
in
the
river
now,
but
the
enemy
galleys
were
backing
water.
They
mean
to
draw
us
in.
They
want
us
jammed
close,
constricted,
no
way
to
sweep
around
their
flanksвЂ¦
and
with
that
boom
behind
us.
He
paced
his
deck,
craning
his
neck
for
a
better
look
at
JoffreyвЂ™s
fleet.
The
boyвЂ™s
toys
included
the
ponderous
Godsgrace,
he
saw,
the
old
slow
Prince
Aemon,
the
Lady
of
Silk
and
her
sister
LadyвЂ™s
Shame,
Wildwind,
Kingslander,
White
Hart,
Lance,
Seaflower.
But
where
was
the
Lionstar?
Where
was
the
beautiful
Lady
Lyanna
that
King
Robert
had
named
in
honor
of
the
maid
heвЂ™d
loved
and
lost?
And
where
was
King
RobertвЂ™s
Hammer?
She
was
the
largest
war
galley
in
the
royal
fleet,
four
hundred
oars,
the
only
warship
the
boy
king
owned
capable
of
overmatching
Fury.
By
rights
she
should
have
formed
the
heart
of
any
defense.

Davos
tasted
a
trap,
yet
he
saw
no
sign
of
any
foes
sweeping
in
behind
them,
only
the
great
fleet
of
Stannis
Baratheon
in
their
ordered
ranks,
stretching
back
to
the
watery
horizon.
Will
they
raise
the
chain
and
cut
us
in
two?
He
could
not
see
what
good
that
would
serve.
The
ships
left
out
in
the
bay
could
still
land
men
north
of
the
city;
a
slower
crossing,
but
safer.

A
flight
of
flickering
orange
birds
took
wing
from
the
castle,
twenty
or
thirty
of
them;
pots
of
burning
pitch,
arcing
out
over
the
river
trailing
threads
of
flame.
The
waters
ate
most,
but
a
few
found
the
decks
of
galleys
in
the
first
line
of
battle,
spreading
flame
when
they
shattered.
Men-at-arms
were
scrambling
on
Queen
AlysanneвЂ™s
deck,
and
he
could
see
smoke
rising
from
three
different
spots
on
Dragonsbane,
nearest
the
bank.
By
then
a
second
flight
was
on
its
way,
and
arrows
were
falling
as
well,
hissing
down
from
the
archersвЂ™
nests
that
studded
the
towers
above.
A
soldier
tumbled
over
CatвЂ™s
gunwale,
crashed
off
the
oars,
and
sank.
The
first
man
to
die
today,
Davos
thought,
but
he
will
not
be
the
last.

Atop
the
Red
KeepвЂ™s
battlements
streamed
the
boy
kingвЂ™s
banners:
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
on
its
gold
field,
the
lion
of
Lannister
on
crimson.
More
pots
of
pitch
came
flying.
Davos
heard
men
shriek
as
fire
spread
across
Courageous.
Her
oarsmen
were
safe
below,
protected
from
missiles
by
the
half
deck
that
sheltered
them,
but
the
men-at-arms
crowded
topside
were
not
so
fortunate.
The
starboard
wing
was
taking
all
the
damage,
as
he
had
feared.
It
will
be
our
turn
soon,
he
reminded
himself,
uneasy.
Black
Betha
was
well
in
range
of
the
firepots,
being
the
sixth
ship
out
from
the
north
bank.
To
starboard,
she
had
only
AllardвЂ™s
Lady
Marya,
the
ungainly
SwordfishвЂ”so
far
behind
now
that
she
was
nearer
the
third
line
than
the
secondвЂ”and
Piety,
Prayer,
and
Devotion,
who
would
need
all
the
godly
intervention
they
could
get,
placed
as
vulnerably
as
they
were.

As
the
second
line
swept
past
the
twin
towers,
Davos
took
a
closer
look.
He
could
see
three
links
of
a
huge
chain
snaking
out
from
a
hole
no
bigger
than
a
manвЂ™s
head
and
disappearing
under
the
water.
The
towers
had
a
single
door,
set
a
good
twenty
feet
off
the
ground.
Bowmen
on
the
roof
of
the
northern
tower
were
firing
down
at
Prayer
and
Devotion.
The
archers
on
Devotion
fired
back,
and
Davos
heard
a
man
scream
as
the
arrows
found
him.

вЂњCaptain
ser.вЂќ
His
son
Matthos
was
at
his
elbow.
вЂњYour
helm.вЂќ
Davos
took
it
with
both
hands
and
slid
it
over
his
head.
The
pothelm
was
visorless;
he
hated
having
his
vision
impeded.

By
then
the
pitch
pots
were
raining
down
around
them.
He
saw
one
shatter
on
the
deck
of
Lady
Marya,
but
AllardвЂ™s
crew
quickly
beat
it
out.
To
port,
warhorns
sounded
from
the
Pride
of
Driftmark.
The
oars
flung
up
sprays
of
water
with
every
stroke.
The
yard-long
shaft
of
a
scorpion
came
down
not
two
feet
from
Matthos
and
sank
into
the
wood
of
the
deck,
thrumming.
Ahead,
the
first
line
was
within
bowshot
of
the
enemy;
flights
of
arrows
flew
between
the
ships,
hissing
like
striking
snakes.

South
of
the
Blackwater,
Davos
saw
men
dragging
crude
rafts
toward
the
water
while
ranks
and
columns
formed
up
beneath
a
thousand
streaming
banners.
The
fiery
heart
was
everywhere,
though
the
tiny
black
stag
imprisoned
in
the
flames
was
too
small
to
make
out.
We
should
be
flying
the
crowned
stag,
he
thought.
The
stag
was
King
RobertвЂ™s
sigil,
the
city
would
rejoice
to
see
it.
This
strangerвЂ™s
standard
serves
only
to
set
men
against
us.

He
could
not
behold
the
fiery
heart
without
thinking
of
the
shadow
Melisandre
had
birthed
in
the
gloom
beneath
StormвЂ™s
End.
At
least
we
fight
this
battle
in
the
light,
with
the
weapons
of
honest
men,
he
told
himself.
The
red
woman
and
her
dark
children
would
have
no
part
of
it.
Stannis
had
shipped
her
back
to
Dragonstone
with
his
bastard
nephew
Edric
Storm.
His
captains
and
bannermen
had
insisted
that
a
battlefield
was
no
place
for
a
woman.
Only
the
queenвЂ™s
men
had
dissented,
and
then
not
loudly.
All
the
same,
the
king
had
been
on
the
point
of
refusing
them
until
Lord
Bryce
Caron
said,
вЂњYour
Grace,
if
the
sorceress
is
with
us,
afterward
men
will
say
it
was
her
victory,
not
yours.
They
will
say
you
owe
your
crown
to
her
spells.вЂќ
That
had
turned
the
tide.
Davos
himself
had
held
his
tongue
during
the
arguments,
but
if
truth
be
told,
he
had
not
been
sad
to
see
the
back
of
her.
He
wanted
no
part
of
Melisandre
or
her
god.

To
starboard,
Devotion
drove
toward
shore,
sliding
out
a
plank.
Archers
scrambled
into
the
shallows,
holding
their
bows
high
over
their
heads
to
keep
the
strings
dry.
They
splashed
ashore
on
the
narrow
strand
beneath
the
bluffs.
Rocks
came
bouncing
down
from
the
castle
to
crash
among
them,
and
arrows
and
spears
as
well,
but
the
angle
was
steep
and
the
missiles
seemed
to
do
little
damage.

Prayer
landed
two
dozen
yards
upstream
and
Piety
was
slanting
toward
the
bank
when
the
defenders
came
pounding
down
the
riverside,
the
hooves
of
their
warhorses
sending
up
gouts
of
water
from
the
shallows.
The
knights
fell
among
the
archers
like
wolves
among
chickens,
driving
them
back
toward
the
ships
and
into
the
river
before
most
could
notch
an
arrow.
Men-at-arms
rushed
to
defend
them
with
spear
and
axe,
and
in
three
heartbeats
the
scene
had
turned
to
blood-soaked
chaos.
Davos
recognized
the
dogвЂ™s-head
helm
of
the
Hound.
A
white
cloak
streamed
from
his
shoulders
as
he
rode
his
horse
up
the
plank
onto
the
deck
of
Prayer,
hacking
down
anyone
who
blundered
within
reach.

Beyond
the
castle,
KingвЂ™s
Landing
rose
on
its
hills
behind
the
encircling
walls.
The
riverfront
was
a
blackened
desolation;
the
Lannisters
had
burned
everything
and
pulled
back
within
the
Mud
Gate.
The
charred
spars
of
sunken
hulks
sat
in
the
shallows,
forbidding
access
to
the
long
stone
quays.
We
shall
have
no
landing
there.
He
could
see
the
tops
of
three
huge
trebuchets
behind
the
Mud
Gate.
High
on
VisenyaвЂ™s
Hill,
sunlight
blazed
off
the
seven
crystal
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.

Davos
never
saw
the
battle
joined,
but
he
heard
it;
a
great
rending
crash
as
two
galleys
came
together.
He
could
not
say
which
two.
Another
impact
echoed
over
the
water
an
instant
later,
and
then
a
third.
Beneath
the
screech
of
splintering
wood,
he
heard
the
deep
thrum-thump
of
the
FuryвЂ™s
fore
catapult.
Stag
of
the
Sea
split
one
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
galleys
clean
in
two,
but
DogвЂ™s
Nose
was
afire
and
Queen
Alysanne
was
locked
between
Lady
of
Silk
and
LadyвЂ™s
Shame,
her
crew
fighting
the
boarders
rail-to-rail.

Directly
ahead,
Davos
saw
the
enemyвЂ™s
Kingslander
drive
between
Faithful
and
Sceptre.
The
former
slid
her
starboard
oars
out
of
the
way
before
impact,
but
SceptreвЂ™s
portside
oars
snapped
like
so
much
kindling
as
Kingslander
raked
along
her
side.
вЂњLoose,вЂќ
Davos
commanded,
and
his
bowmen
sent
a
withering
rain
of
shafts
across
the
water.
He
saw
KingslanderвЂ™s
captain
fall,
and
tried
to
recall
the
manвЂ™s
name.

Ashore,
the
arms
of
the
great
trebuchets
rose
one,
two,
three,
and
a
hundred
stones
climbed
high
into
the
yellow
sky.
Each
one
was
as
large
as
a
manвЂ™s
head;
when
they
fell
they
sent
up
great
gouts
of
water,
smashed
through
oak
planking,
and
turned
living
men
into
bone
and
pulp
and
gristle.
All
across
the
river
the
first
line
was
engaged.
Grappling
hooks
were
flung
out,
iron
rams
crashed
through
wooden
hulls,
boarders
swarmed,
flights
of
arrows
whispered
through
each
other
in
the
drifting
smoke,
and
men
diedвЂ¦
but
so
far,
none
of
his.

Black
Betha
swept
upriver,
the
sound
of
her
oarmasterвЂ™s
drum
thundering
in
her
captainвЂ™s
head
as
he
looked
for
a
likely
victim
for
her
ram.
The
beleaguered
Queen
Alysanne
was
trapped
between
two
Lannister
warships,
the
three
made
fast
by
hooks
and
lines.

вЂњRamming
speed!вЂќ
Davos
shouted.

The
drumbeats
blurred
into
a
long
fevered
hammering,
and
Black
Betha
flew,
the
water
turning
white
as
milk
as
it
parted
for
her
prow.
Allard
had
seen
the
same
chance;
Lady
Marya
ran
beside
them.
The
first
line
had
been
transformed
into
a
confusion
of
separate
struggles.
The
three
tangled
ships
loomed
ahead,
turning,
their
decks
a
red
chaos
as
men
hacked
at
each
other
with
sword
and
axe.
A
little
more,
Davos
Seaworth
beseeched
the
Warrior,
bring
her
around
a
little
more,
show
me
her
broadside.

The
Warrior
must
have
been
listening.
Black
Betha
and
Lady
Marya
slammed
into
the
side
of
LadyвЂ™s
Shame
within
an
instant
of
each
other,
ramming
her
fore
and
aft
with
such
force
that
men
were
thrown
off
the
deck
of
Lady
of
Silk
three
boats
away.
Davos
almost
bit
his
tongue
off
when
his
teeth
jarred
together.
He
spat
out
blood.
Next
time
close
your
mouth,
you
fool.
Forty
years
at
sea,
and
yet
this
was
the
first
time
heвЂ™d
rammed
another
ship.
His
archers
were
loosing
arrows
at
will.

вЂњBack
water,вЂќ
he
commanded.
When
Black
Betha
reversed
her
oars,
the
river
rushed
into
the
splintered
hole
she
left,
and
LadyвЂ™s
Shame
fell
to
pieces
before
his
eyes,
spilling
dozens
of
men
into
the
river.
Some
of
the
living
swam;
some
of
the
dead
floated;
the
ones
in
heavy
mail
and
plate
sank
to
the
bottom,
the
quick
and
the
dead
alike.
The
pleas
of
drowning
men
echoed
in
his
ears.

A
flash
of
green
caught
his
eye,
ahead
and
off
to
port,
and
a
nest
of
writhing
emerald
serpents
rose
burning
and
hissing
from
the
stern
of
Queen
Alysanne.
An
instant
later
Davos
heard
the
dread
cry
of
вЂњWildfire!вЂќ

He
grimaced.
Burning
pitch
was
one
thing,
wildfire
quite
another.
Evil
stuff,
and
well-nigh
unquenchable.
Smother
it
under
a
cloak
and
the
cloak
took
fire;
slap
at
a
fleck
of
it
with
your
palm
and
your
hand
was
aflame.
вЂњPiss
on
wildfire
and
your
cock
burns
off,вЂќ
old
seamen
liked
to
say.
Still,
Ser
Imry
had
warned
them
to
expect
a
taste
of
the
alchemistsвЂ™
vile
substance.
Fortunately,
there
were
few
true
pyromancers
left.
They
will
soon
run
out,
Ser
Imry
had
assured
them.

Davos
reeled
off
commands;
one
bank
of
oars
pushed
off
while
the
other
backed
water,
and
the
galley
came
about.
Lady
Marya
had
won
clear
too,
and
a
good
thing;
the
fire
was
spreading
over
Queen
Alysanne
and
her
foes
faster
than
he
would
have
believed
possible.
Men
wreathed
in
green
flame
leapt
into
the
water,
shrieking
like
nothing
human.
On
the
walls
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing,
spitfires
were
belching
death,
and
the
great
trebuchets
behind
the
Mud
Gate
were
throwing
boulders.
One
the
size
of
an
ox
crashed
down
between
Black
Betha
and
Wraith,
rocking
both
ships
and
soaking
every
man
on
deck.
Another,
not
much
smaller,
found
Bold
Laughter.
The
Velaryon
galley
exploded
like
a
childвЂ™s
toy
dropped
from
a
tower,
spraying
splinters
as
long
as
a
manвЂ™s
arm.

Through
black
smoke
and
swirling
green
fire,
Davos
glimpsed
a
swarm
of
small
boats
bearing
downriver:
a
confusion
of
ferries
and
wherries,
barges,
skiffs,
rowboats,
and
hulks
that
looked
too
rotten
to
float.
It
stank
of
desperation;
such
driftwood
could
not
turn
the
tide
of
a
fight,
only
get
in
the
way.
The
lines
of
battle
were
hopelessly
ensnarled,
he
saw.
Off
to
port,
Lord
Steffon,
Ragged
Jenna,
and
Swift
Sword
had
broken
through
and
were
sweeping
upriver.
The
starboard
wing
was
heavily
engaged,
however,
and
the
center
had
shattered
under
the
stones
of
those
trebuchets,
some
captains
turning
downstream,
others
veering
to
port,
anything
to
escape
that
crushing
rain.
Fury
had
swung
her
aft
catapult
to
fire
back
at
the
city,
but
she
lacked
the
range;
the
barrels
of
pitch
were
shattering
under
the
walls.
Sceptre
had
lost
most
of
her
oars,
and
Faithful
had
been
rammed
and
was
starting
to
list.
He
took
Black
Betha
between
them,
and
struck
a
glancing
blow
at
Queen
CerseiвЂ™s
ornate
carved-and-gilded
pleasure
barge,
laden
with
soldiers
instead
of
sweetmeats
now.
The
collision
spilled
a
dozen
of
them
into
the
river,
where
BethaвЂ™s
archers
picked
them
off
as
they
tried
to
stay
afloat.

MatthosвЂ™s
shout
alerted
him
to
the
danger
from
port;
one
of
the
Lannister
galleys
was
coming
about
to
ram.
вЂњHard
to
starboard,вЂќ
Davos
shouted.
His
men
used
their
oars
to
push
free
of
the
barge,
while
others
turned
the
galley
so
her
prow
faced
the
onrushing
White
Hart.
For
a
moment
he
feared
heвЂ™d
been
too
slow,
that
he
was
about
to
be
sunk,
but
the
current
helped
swing
Black
Betha,
and
when
the
impact
came
it
was
only
a
glancing
blow,
the
two
hulls
scraping
against
each
other,
both
ships
snapping
oars.
A
jagged
piece
of
wood
flew
past
his
head,
sharp
as
any
spear.
Davos
flinched.
вЂњBoard
her!вЂќ
he
shouted.
Grappling
lines
were
flung.
He
drew
his
sword
and
led
them
over
the
rail
himself.

The
crew
of
the
White
Hart
met
them
at
the
rail,
but
Black
BethaвЂ™s
men-at-arms
swept
over
them
in
a
screaming
steel
tide.
Davos
fought
through
the
press,
looking
for
the
other
captain,
but
the
man
was
dead
before
he
reached
him.
As
he
stood
over
the
body,
someone
caught
him
from
behind
with
an
axe,
but
his
helm
turned
the
blow,
and
his
skull
was
left
ringing
when
it
might
have
been
split.
Dazed,
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
roll.
His
attacker
charged
screaming.
Davos
grasped
his
sword
in
both
hands
and
drove
it
up
point
first
into
the
manвЂ™s
belly.

One
of
his
crewmen
pulled
him
back
to
his
feet.
вЂњCaptain
ser,
the
Hart
is
ours.вЂќ
It
was
true,
Davos
saw.
Most
of
the
enemy
were
dead,
dying,
or
yielded.
He
took
off
his
helm,
wiped
blood
from
his
face,
and
made
his
way
back
to
his
own
ship,
trodding
carefully
on
boards
slimy
with
menвЂ™s
guts.
Matthos
lent
him
a
hand
to
help
him
back
over
the
rail.

For
those
few
instants,
Black
Betha
and
White
Hart
were
the
calm
eye
in
the
midst
of
the
storm.
Queen
Alysanne
and
Lady
of
Silk,
still
locked
together,
were
a
ranging
green
inferno,
drifting
downriver
and
dragging
pieces
of
LadyвЂ™s
Shame.
One
of
the
Myrish
galleys
had
slammed
into
them
and
was
now
afire
as
well.
Cat
was
taking
on
men
from
the
fast-sinking
Courageous.
The
captain
of
Dragonsbane
had
driven
her
between
two
quays,
ripping
out
her
bottom;
her
crew
poured
ashore
with
the
archers
and
men-at-arms
to
join
the
assault
on
the
walls.
Red
Raven,
rammed,
was
slowly
listing.
Stag
of
the
Sea
was
fighting
fires
and
boarders
both,
but
the
fiery
heart
had
been
raised
over
JoffreyвЂ™s
Loyal
Man.
Fury,
her
proud
bow
smashed
in
by
a
boulder,
was
engaged
with
Godsgrace.
He
saw
Lord
VelaryonвЂ™s
Pride
of
Driftmark
crash
between
two
Lannister
river
runners,
overturning
one
and
lighting
the
other
up
with
fire
arrows.
On
the
south
bank,
knights
were
leading
their
mounts
aboard
the
cogs,
and
some
of
the
smaller
galleys
were
already
making
their
way
across,
laden
with
men-at-arms.
They
had
to
thread
cautiously
between
sinking
ships
and
patches
of
drifting
wildfire.
The
whole
of
King
StannisвЂ™s
fleet
was
in
the
river
now,
save
for
Salladhor
SaanвЂ™s
Lyseni.
Soon
enough
they
would
control
the
Blackwater.
Ser
Imry
will
have
his
victory,
Davos
thought,
and
Stannis
will
bring
his
host
across,
but
gods
be
good,
the
cost
of
thisвЂ¦

вЂњCaptain
ser!вЂќ
Matthos
touched
his
shoulder.

It
was
Swordfish,
her
two
banks
of
oars
lifting
and
falling.
She
had
never
brought
down
her
sails,
and
some
burning
pitch
had
caught
in
her
rigging.
The
flames
spread
as
Davos
watched,
creeping
out
over
ropes
and
sails
until
she
trailed
a
head
of
yellow
flame.
Her
ungainly
iron
ram,
fashioned
after
the
likeness
of
the
fish
from
which
she
took
her
name,
parted
the
surface
of
the
river
before
her.
Directly
ahead,
drifting
toward
her
and
swinging
around
to
present
a
tempting
plump
target,
was
one
of
the
Lannister
hulks,
floating
low
in
the
water.
Slow
green
blood
was
leaking
out
between
her
boards.

When
he
saw
that,
Davos
SeaworthвЂ™s
heart
stopped
beating.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњNo,
NOOOOOOOO!вЂќ
Above
the
roar
and
crash
of
battle,
no
one
heard
him
but
Matthos.
Certainly
the
captain
of
the
Swordfish
did
not,
intent
as
he
was
on
finally
spearing
something
with
his
ungainly
fat
sword.
The
Swordfish
went
to
battle
speed.
Davos
lifted
his
maimed
hand
to
clutch
at
the
leather
pouch
that
held
his
fingerbones.

With
a
grinding,
splintering,
tearing
crash,
Swordfish
split
the
rotted
hulk
asunder.
She
burst
like
an
overripe
fruit,
but
no
fruit
had
ever
screamed
that
shattering
wooden
scream.
From
inside
her
Davos
saw
green
gushing
from
a
thousand
broken
jars,
poison
from
the
entrails
of
a
dying
beast,
glistening,
shining,
spreading
across
the
surface
of
the
riverвЂ¦

вЂњBack
water,вЂќ
he
roared.
вЂњAway.
Get
us
off
her,
back
water,
back
water!вЂќ
The
grappling
lines
were
cut,
and
Davos
felt
the
deck
move
under
his
feet
as
Black
Betha
pushed
free
of
White
Hart.
Her
oars
slid
down
into
the
water.

Then
he
heard
a
short
sharp
woof,
as
if
someone
had
blown
in
his
ear.
Half
a
heartbeat
later
came
the
roar.
The
deck
vanished
beneath
him,
and
black
water
smashed
him
across
the
face,
filling
his
nose
and
mouth.
He
was
choking,
drowning.
Unsure
which
way
was
up,
Davos
wrestled
the
river
in
blind
panic
until
suddenly
he
broke
the
surface.
He
spat
out
water,
sucked
in
air,
grabbed
hold
of
the
nearest
chunk
of
debris,
and
held
on.

Swordfish
and
the
hulk
were
gone,
blackened
bodies
were
floating
downstream
beside
him,
and
choking
men
clinging
to
bits
of
smoking
wood.
Fifty
feet
high,
a
swirling
demon
of
green
flame
danced
upon
the
river.
It
had
a
dozen
hands,
in
each
a
whip,
and
whatever
they
touched
burst
into
fire.
He
saw
Black
Betha
burning,
and
White
Hart
and
Loyal
Man
to
either
side.
Piety,
Cat,
Courageous,
Sceptre,
Red
Raven,
Harridan,
Faithful,
Fury,
they
had
all
gone
up,
Kingslander
and
Godsgrace
as
well,
the
demon
was
eating
his
own.
Lord
VelaryonвЂ™s
shining
Pride
of
Driftmark
was
trying
to
turn,
but
the
demon
ran
a
lazy
green
finger
across
her
silvery
oars
and
they
flared
up
like
so
many
tapers.
For
an
instant
she
seemed
to
be
stroking
the
river
with
two
banks
of
long
bright
torches.

The
current
had
him
in
its
teeth
by
then,
spinning
him
around
and
around.
He
kicked
to
avoid
a
floating
patch
of
wildfire.
My
sons,
Davos
thought,
but
there
was
no
way
to
look
for
them
amidst
the
roaring
chaos.
Another
hulk
heavy
with
wildfire
went
up
behind
him.
The
Blackwater
itself
seemed
to
boil
in
its
bed,
and
burning
spars
and
burning
men
and
pieces
of
broken
ships
filled
the
air.

IвЂ™m
being
swept
out
into
the
bay.
It
wouldnвЂ™t
be
as
bad
there;
he
ought
to
be
able
to
make
shore,
he
was
a
strong
swimmer.
Salladhor
SaanвЂ™s
galleys
would
be
out
in
the
bay
as
well,
Ser
Imry
had
commanded
them
to
stand
offвЂ¦

And
then
the
current
turned
him
about
again,
and
Davos
saw
what
awaited
him
downstream.

The
chain.
Gods
save
us,
theyвЂ™ve
raised
the
chain.

Where
the
river
broadened
out
into
Blackwater
Bay,
the
boom
stretched
taut,
a
bare
two
or
three
feet
above
the
water.
Already
a
dozen
galleys
had
crashed
into
it,
and
the
current
was
pushing
others
against
them.
Almost
all
were
aflame,
and
the
rest
soon
would
be.
Davos
could
make
out
the
striped
hulls
of
Salladhor
SaanвЂ™s
ships
beyond,
but
he
knew
he
would
never
reach
them.
A
wall
of
red-hot
steel,
blazing
wood,
and
swirling
green
flame
stretched
before
him.
The
mouth
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
had
turned
into
the
mouth
of
hell.





TYRION

Motionless
as
a
gargoyle,
Tyrion
Lannister
hunched
on
one
knee
atop
a
merlon.
Beyond
the
Mud
Gate
and
the
desolation
that
had
once
been
the
fishmarket
and
wharves,
the
river
itself
seemed
to
have
taken
fire.
Half
of
StannisвЂ™s
fleet
was
ablaze,
along
with
most
of
JoffreyвЂ™s.
The
kiss
of
wildfire
turned
proud
ships
into
funeral
pyres
and
men
into
living
torches.
The
air
was
full
of
smoke
and
arrows
and
screams.

Downstream,
commoners
and
highborn
captains
alike
could
see
the
hot
green
death
swirling
toward
their
rafts
and
carracks
and
ferries,
borne
on
the
current
of
the
Blackwater.
The
long
white
oars
of
the
Myrish
galleys
flashed
like
the
legs
of
maddened
centipedes
as
they
fought
to
come
about,
but
it
was
no
good.
The
centipedes
had
no
place
to
run.

A
dozen
great
fires
raged
under
the
city
walls,
where
casks
of
burning
pitch
had
exploded,
but
the
wildfire
reduced
them
to
no
more
than
candles
in
a
burning
house,
their
orange
and
scarlet
pennons
fluttering
insignificantly
against
the
jade
holocaust.
The
low
clouds
caught
the
color
of
the
burning
river
and
roofed
the
sky
in
shades
of
shifting
green,
eerily
beautiful.
A
terrible
beauty.
Like
dragonfire.
Tyrion
wondered
if
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
felt
like
this
as
he
flew
above
his
Field
of
Fire.

The
furnace
wind
lifted
his
crimson
cloak
and
beat
at
his
bare
face,
yet
he
could
not
turn
away.
He
was
dimly
aware
of
the
gold
cloaks
cheering
from
the
hoardings.
He
had
no
voice
to
join
them.
It
was
a
half
victory.
It
will
not
be
enough.

He
saw
another
of
the
hulks
heвЂ™d
stuffed
full
of
King
AerysвЂ™s
fickle
fruits
engulfed
by
the
hungry
flames.
A
fountain
of
burning
jade
rose
from
the
river
the
blast
so
bright
he
had
to
shield
his
eyes.
Plumes
of
fire
thirty
and
forty
feet
high
danced
upon
the
waters,
crackling
and
hissing.
For
a
few
moments
they
washed
out
the
screams.
There
were
hundreds
in
the
water,
drowning
or
burning
or
doing
a
little
of
both.

Do
you
hear
them
shrieking,
Stannis?
Do
you
see
them
burning?
This
is
your
work
as
much
as
mine.
Somewhere
in
that
seething
mass
of
men
south
of
the
Blackwater,
Stannis
was
watching
too,
Tyrion
knew.
HeвЂ™d
never
had
his
brother
RobertвЂ™s
thirst
for
battle.
He
would
command
from
the
rear,
from
the
reserve,
much
as
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
wont
to
do.
Like
as
not,
he
was
sitting
a
warhorse
right
now,
clad
in
bright
armor,
his
crown
upon
his
head.
A
crown
of
red
gold,
Varys
says,
its
points
fashioned
in
the
shapes
of
flames.

вЂњMy
ships.вЂќ
JoffreyвЂ™s
voice
cracked
as
he
shouted
up
from
the
wallwalk,
where
he
huddled
with
his
guards
behind
the
ramparts.
The
golden
circlet
of
kingship
adorned
his
battle
helm.
вЂњMy
KingslanderвЂ™s
burning,
Queen
Cersei,
Loyal
Man.
Look,
thatвЂ™s
Seaflower,
there.вЂќ
He
pointed
with
his
new
sword,
out
to
where
the
green
flames
were
licking
at
SeaflowerвЂ™s
golden
hull
and
creeping
up
her
oars.
Her
captain
had
turned
her
upriver,
but
not
quickly
enough
to
evade
the
wildfire.

She
was
doomed,
Tyrion
knew.
There
was
no
other
way.
If
we
had
not
come
forth
to
meet
them,
Stannis
would
have
sensed
the
trap.
An
arrow
could
be
aimed,
and
a
spear,
even
the
stone
from
a
catapult,
but
wildfire
had
a
will
of
its
own.
Once
loosed,
it
was
beyond
the
control
of
mere
men.
вЂњIt
could
not
be
helped,вЂќ
he
told
his
nephew.
вЂњOur
fleet
was
doomed
in
any
case.вЂќ

Even
from
atop
the
merlonвЂ”he
had
been
too
short
to
see
over
the
ramparts,
so
heвЂ™d
had
them
boost
him
upвЂ”the
flames
and
smoke
and
chaos
of
battle
made
it
impossible
for
Tyrion
to
see
what
was
happening
downriver
under
the
castle,
but
he
had
seen
it
a
thousand
times
in
his
mindвЂ™s
eye.
Bronn
would
have
whipped
the
oxen
into
motion
the
moment
StannisвЂ™s
flagship
passed
under
the
Red
Keep;
the
chain
was
ponderous
heavy,
and
the
great
winches
turned
but
slowly,
creaking
and
rumbling.
The
whole
of
the
usurperвЂ™s
fleet
would
have
passed
by
the
time
the
first
glimmer
of
metal
could
be
seen
beneath
the
water.
The
links
would
emerge
dripping
wet,
some
glistening
with
mud,
link
by
link
by
link,
until
the
whole
great
chain
stretched
taut.
King
Stannis
had
rowed
his
fleet
up
the
Blackwater,
but
he
would
not
row
out
again.

Even
so,
some
were
getting
away.
A
riverвЂ™s
current
was
a
tricky
thing,
and
the
wildfire
was
not
spreading
as
evenly
as
he
had
hoped.
The
main
channel
was
all
aflame,
but
a
good
many
of
the
Myrmen
had
made
for
the
south
bank
and
looked
to
escape
unscathed,
and
at
least
eight
ships
had
landed
under
the
city
walls.
Landed
or
wrecked,
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing,
theyвЂ™ve
put
men
ashore.
Worse,
a
good
part
of
the
south
wing
of
the
enemyвЂ™s
first
two
battle
lines
had
been
well
upstream
of
the
inferno
when
the
hulks
went
up.
Stannis
would
be
left
with
thirty
or
forty
galleys,
at
a
guess;
more
than
enough
to
bring
his
whole
host
across,
once
they
had
regained
their
courage.

That
might
take
a
bit
of
time;
even
the
bravest
would
be
dismayed
after
watching
a
thousand
or
so
of
his
fellows
consumed
by
wildfire.
Hallyne
said
that
sometimes
the
substance
burned
so
hot
that
flesh
melted
like
tallow.
Yet
even
soвЂ¦

Tyrion
had
no
illusions
where
his
own
men
were
concerned.
If
the
battle
looks
to
be
going
sour
theyвЂ™ll
break,
and
theyвЂ™ll
break
bad,
Jacelyn
Bywater
had
warned
him,
so
the
only
way
to
win
was
to
make
certain
the
battle
stayed
sweet,
start
to
finish.

He
could
see
dark
shapes
moving
through
the
charred
ruins
of
the
riverfront
wharfs.
Time
for
another
sortie,
he
thought.
Men
were
never
so
vulnerable
as
when
they
first
staggered
ashore.
He
must
not
give
the
foe
time
to
form
up
on
the
north
bank.

He
scrambled
down
off
the
merlon.
вЂњTell
Lord
Jacelyn
weвЂ™ve
got
enemy
on
the
riverfront,вЂќ
he
said
to
one
of
the
runners
Bywater
had
assigned
him.
To
another
he
said,
вЂњBring
my
compliments
to
Ser
Arneld
and
ask
him
to
swing
the
Whores
thirty
degrees
west.вЂќ
The
angle
would
allow
them
to
throw
farther,
if
not
as
far
out
into
the
water.

вЂњMother
promised
I
could
have
the
Whores,вЂќ
Joffrey
said.
Tyrion
was
annoyed
to
see
that
the
king
had
lifted
the
visor
of
his
helm
again.
Doubtless
the
boy
was
cooking
inside
all
that
heavy
steelвЂ¦
but
the
last
thing
he
needed
was
some
stray
arrow
punching
through
his
nephewвЂ™s
eye.

He
clanged
the
visor
shut.
вЂњKeep
that
closed,
Your
Grace;
your
sweet
person
is
precious
to
us
all.вЂќ
And
you
donвЂ™t
want
to
spoil
that
pretty
face,
either.
вЂњThe
Whores
are
yours.вЂќ
It
was
as
good
a
time
as
any;
flinging
more
firepots
down
onto
burning
ships
seemed
pointless.
Joff
had
the
Antler
Men
trussed
up
naked
in
the
square
below,
antlers
nailed
to
their
heads.
When
theyвЂ™d
been
brought
before
the
Iron
Throne
for
justice,
he
had
promised
to
send
them
to
Stannis.
A
man
was
not
as
heavy
as
a
boulder
or
a
cask
of
burning
pitch,
and
could
be
thrown
a
deal
farther.
Some
of
the
gold
cloaks
had
been
wagering
on
whether
the
traitors
would
fly
all
the
way
across
the
Blackwater.
вЂњBe
quick
about
it,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
he
told
Joffrey.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
want
the
trebuchets
throwing
stones
again
soon
enough.
Even
wildfire
does
not
burn
forever.вЂќ

Joffrey
hurried
off
happy,
escorted
by
Ser
Meryn,
but
Tyrion
caught
Ser
Osmund
by
the
wrist
before
he
could
follow.
вЂњWhatever
happens,
keep
him
safe
and
keep
him
there,
is
that
understood?вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
command.вЂќ
Ser
Osmund
smiled
amiably.

Tyrion
had
warned
Trant
and
Kettleblack
what
would
happen
to
them
should
any
harm
come
to
the
king.
And
Joffrey
had
a
dozen
veteran
gold
cloaks
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
steps.
IвЂ™m
protecting
your
wretched
bastard
as
well
as
I
can,
Cersei,
he
thought
bitterly.
See
you
do
the
same
for
Alayaya.

No
sooner
was
Joff
off
than
a
runner
came
panting
up
the
steps.
вЂњMy
lord,
hurry!вЂќ
He
threw
himself
to
one
knee.
вЂњTheyвЂ™ve
landed
men
on
the
tourney
grounds,
hundreds!
TheyвЂ™re
bringing
a
ram
up
to
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate.вЂќ

Tyrion
cursed
and
made
for
the
steps
with
a
rolling
waddle.
Podrick
Payne
waited
below
with
their
horses.
They
galloped
off
down
River
Row,
Pod
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
coming
hard
behind
him.
The
shuttered
houses
were
steeped
in
green
shadow,
but
there
was
no
traffic
to
get
in
their
way;
Tyrion
had
commanded
that
the
street
be
kept
clear,
so
the
defenders
could
move
quickly
from
one
gate
to
the
next.
Even
so,
by
the
time
they
reached
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate,
he
could
hear
a
booming
crash
of
wood
on
wood
that
told
him
the
battering
ram
had
been
brought
into
play.
The
groaning
of
the
great
hinges
sounded
like
the
moans
of
a
dying
giant.
The
gatehouse
square
was
littered
with
the
wounded,
but
he
saw
lines
of
horses
as
well,
not
all
of
them
hurt,
and
sellswords
and
gold
cloaks
enough
to
form
a
strong
column.
вЂњForm
up,вЂќ
he
shouted
as
he
leapt
to
the
ground.
The
gate
moved
under
the
impact
of
another
blow.
вЂњWho
commands
here?
YouвЂ™re
going
out.вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
A
shadow
detached
itself
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall,
to
become
a
tall
man
in
dark
grey
armor.
Sandor
Clegane
wrenched
off
his
helm
with
both
hands
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
steel
was
scorched
and
dented,
the
left
ear
of
the
snarling
hound
sheared
off.
A
gash
above
one
eye
had
sent
a
wash
of
blood
down
across
the
HoundвЂ™s
old
burn
scars,
masking
half
his
face.

вЂњYes.вЂќ
Tyrion
faced
him.

CleganeвЂ™s
breath
came
ragged.
вЂњBugger
that.
And
you.вЂќ

A
sellsword
stepped
up
beside
him.
вЂњWe
been
out.
Three
times.
Half
our
men
are
killed
or
hurt.
Wildfire
bursting
all
around
us,
horses
screaming
like
men
and
men
like
horsesвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDid
you
think
we
hired
you
to
fight
in
a
tourney?
Shall
I
bring
you
a
nice
iced
milk
and
a
bowl
of
raspberries?
No?
Then
get
on
your
fucking
horse.
You
too,
dog.вЂќ

The
blood
on
CleganeвЂ™s
face
glistened
red,
but
his
eyes
showed
white.
He
drew
his
longsword.

He
is
afraid,
Tyrion
realized,
shocked.
The
Hound
is
frightened.
He
tried
to
explain
their
need.
вЂњTheyвЂ™ve
taken
a
ram
to
the
gate,
you
can
hear
them,
we
need
to
disperse
themвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњOpen
the
gates.
When
they
rush
inside,
surround
them
and
kill
them.вЂќ
The
Hound
thrust
the
point
of
his
longsword
into
the
ground
and
leaned
upon
the
pommel,
swaying.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
lost
half
my
men.
Horse
as
well.
IвЂ™m
not
taking
more
into
that
fire.вЂќ

Ser
Mandon
Moore
moved
to
TyrionвЂ™s
side,
immaculate
in
his
enameled
white
plate.
вЂњThe
KingвЂ™s
Hand
commands
you.вЂќ

вЂњBugger
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand.вЂќ
Where
the
HoundвЂ™s
face
was
not
sticky
with
blood,
it
was
pale
as
milk.
вЂњSomeone
bring
me
a
drink.вЂќ
A
gold
cloak
officer
handed
him
a
cup.
Clegane
took
a
swallow,
spit
it
out,
flung
the
cup
away.
вЂњWater?
Fuck
your
water.
Bring
me
wine.вЂќ

He
is
dead
on
his
feet.
Tyrion
could
see
it
now.
The
wound,
the
fireвЂ¦
heвЂ™s
done,
I
need
to
find
someone
else,
but
who?
Ser
Mandon?
He
looked
at
the
men
and
knew
it
would
not
do.
CleganeвЂ™s
fear
had
shaken
them.
Without
a
leader,
they
would
refuse
as
well,
and
Ser
MandonвЂ¦
a
dangerous
man,
Jaime
said,
yes,
but
not
a
man
other
men
would
follow.

In
the
distance
Tyrion
heard
another
great
crash.
Above
the
walls,
the
darkening
sky
was
awash
with
sheets
of
green
and
orange
light.
How
long
could
the
gate
hold?

This
is
madness,
he
thought,
but
sooner
madness
than
defeat.
Defeat
is
death
and
shame.
вЂњVery
well,
IвЂ™ll
lead
the
sortie.вЂќ

If
he
thought
that
would
shame
the
Hound
back
to
valor,
he
was
wrong.
Clegane
only
laughed.
вЂњYou?вЂќ

Tyrion
could
see
the
disbelief
on
their
faces.
вЂњMe.
Ser
Mandon,
youвЂ™ll
bear
the
kingвЂ™s
banner.
Pod,
my
helm.вЂќ
The
boy
ran
to
obey.
The
Hound
leaned
on
that
notched
and
blood-streaked
sword
and
looked
at
him
with
those
wide
white
eyes.
Ser
Mandon
helped
Tyrion
mount
up
again.
вЂњForm
up!вЂќ
he
shouted.

His
big
red
stallion
wore
crinet
and
chamfron.
Crimson
silk
draped
his
hindquarters,
over
a
coat
of
mail.
The
high
saddle
was
gilded.
Podrik
Payne
handed
up
helm
and
shield,
heavy
oak
emblazoned
with
a
golden
hand
on
red,
surrounded
by
small
golden
lions.
He
walked
his
horse
in
a
circle,
looking
at
the
little
force
of
men.
Only
a
handful
had
responded
to
his
command,
no
more
than
twenty.
They
sat
their
horses
with
eyes
as
white
as
the
HoundвЂ™s.
He
looked
contemptuously
at
the
others,
the
knights
and
sellswords
who
had
ridden
with
Clegane.
вЂњThey
say
IвЂ™m
half
a
man,вЂќ
he
said.
вЂњWhat
does
that
make
the
lot
of
you?вЂќ

That
shamed
them
well
enough.
A
knight
mounted,
helmetless,
and
rode
to
join
the
others.
A
pair
of
sellswords
followed.
Then
more.
The
KingвЂ™s
Gate
shuddered
again.
In
a
few
moments
the
size
of
TyrionвЂ™s
command
had
doubled.
He
had
them
trapped.
If
I
fight,
they
must
do
the
same,
or
they
are
less
than
dwarfs.

вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
hear
me
shout
out
JoffreyвЂ™s
name,вЂќ
he
told
them.
вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
hear
me
yell
for
Casterly
Rock
either.
This
is
your
city
Stannis
means
to
sack,
and
thatвЂ™s
your
gate
heвЂ™s
bringing
down.
So
come
with
me
and
kill
the
son
of
a
bitch!вЂќ
Tyrion
unsheathed
his
axe,
wheeled
the
stallion
around,
and
trotted
toward
the
sally
port.
He
thought
they
were
following,
but
never
dared
to
look.





SANSA

The
torches
shimmered
brightly
against
the
hammered
metal
of
the
wall
sconces,
filling
the
QueenвЂ™s
Ballroom
with
silvery
light.
Yet
there
was
still
darkness
in
that
hall.
Sansa
could
see
it
in
the
pale
eyes
of
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
who
stood
by
the
back
door
still
as
stone,
taking
neither
food
nor
wine.
She
could
hear
it
in
Lord
GylesвЂ™s
racking
cough,
and
the
whispered
voice
of
Osney
Kettleblack
when
he
slipped
in
to
bring
Cersei
the
tidings.

Sansa
was
finishing
her
broth
when
he
came
the
first
time,
entering
through
the
back.
She
glimpsed
him
talking
to
his
brother
Osfryd.
Then
he
climbed
the
dais
and
knelt
beside
the
high
seat,
smelling
of
horse,
four
long
thin
scratches
on
his
cheek
crusted
with
scabs,
his
hair
falling
down
past
his
collar
and
into
his
eyes.
For
all
his
whispering,
Sansa
could
not
help
but
hear.
вЂњThe
fleets
are
locked
in
battle.
Some
archers
got
ashore,
but
the
HoundвЂ™s
cut
them
to
pieces,
YвЂ™Grace.
Your
brotherвЂ™s
raising
his
chain,
I
heard
the
signal.
Some
drunkards
down
to
Flea
Bottom
are
smashing
doors
and
climbing
through
windows.
Lord
BywaterвЂ™s
sent
the
gold
cloaks
to
deal
with
them.
BaelorвЂ™s
Sept
is
jammed
full,
everyone
praying.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
my
son?вЂќ

вЂњThe
king
went
to
BaelorвЂ™s
to
get
the
High
SeptonвЂ™s
blessing.
Now
heвЂ™s
walking
the
walls
with
the
Hand,
telling
the
men
to
be
brave,
lifting
their
spirits
as
it
were.вЂќ

Cersei
beckoned
to
her
page
for
another
cup
of
wine,
a
golden
vintage
from
the
Arbor,
fruity
and
rich.
The
queen
was
drinking
heavily,
but
the
wine
only
seemed
to
make
her
more
beautiful;
her
cheeks
were
flushed,
and
her
eyes
had
a
bright,
feverish
heat
to
them
as
she
looked
down
over
the
hall.
Eyes
of
wildfire,
Sansa
thought.

Musicians
played.
Jugglers
juggled.
Moon
Boy
lurched
about
the
hall
on
stilts
making
mock
of
everyone,
while
Ser
Dontos
chased
serving
girls
on
his
broomstick
horse.
The
guests
laughed,
but
it
was
a
joyless
laughter,
the
sort
of
laughter
that
can
turn
into
sobbing
in
half
a
heartbeat.
Their
bodies
are
here,
but
their
thoughts
are
on
the
city
walls,
and
their
hearts
as
well.

After
the
broth
came
a
salad
of
apples,
nuts,
and
raisins.
At
any
other
time,
it
might
have
made
a
tasty
dish,
but
tonight
all
the
food
was
flavored
with
fear.
Sansa
was
not
the
only
one
in
the
hall
without
an
appetite.
Lord
Gyles
was
coughing
more
than
he
was
eating,
Lollys
Stokeworth
sat
hunched
and
shivering,
and
the
young
bride
of
one
of
Ser
LancelвЂ™s
knights
began
to
weep
uncontrollably.
The
queen
commanded
Maester
Frenken
to
put
her
to
bed
with
a
cup
of
dreamwine.
вЂњTears,вЂќ
she
said
scornfully
to
Sansa
as
the
woman
was
led
from
the
hall.
вЂњThe
womanвЂ™s
weapon,
my
lady
mother
used
to
call
them.
The
manвЂ™s
weapon
is
a
sword.
And
that
tells
us
all
you
need
to
know,
doesnвЂ™t
it?вЂќ

вЂњMen
must
be
very
brave,
though,вЂќ
said
Sansa.
вЂњTo
ride
out
and
face
swords
and
axes,
everyone
trying
to
kill
youвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњJaime
told
me
once
that
he
only
feels
truly
alive
in
battle
and
in
bed.вЂќ
She
lifted
her
cup
and
took
a
long
swallow.
Her
salad
was
untouched.
вЂњI
would
sooner
face
any
number
of
swords
than
sit
helpless
like
this,
pretending
to
enjoy
the
company
of
this
flock
of
frightened
hens.вЂќ

вЂњYou
asked
them
here,
Your
Grace.вЂќ

вЂњCertain
things
are
expected
of
a
queen.
They
will
be
expected
of
you
should
you
ever
wed
Joffrey.
Best
learn.вЂќ
The
queen
studied
the
wives,
daughters,
and
mothers
who
filled
the
benches.
вЂњOf
themselves
the
hens
are
nothing,
but
their
cocks
are
important
for
one
reason
or
another,
and
some
may
survive
this
battle.
So
it
behooves
me
to
give
their
women
my
protection.
If
my
wretched
dwarf
of
a
brother
should
somehow
manage
to
prevail,
they
will
return
to
their
husbands
and
fathers
full
of
tales
about
how
brave
I
was,
how
my
courage
inspired
them
and
lifted
their
spirits,
how
I
never
doubted
our
victory
even
for
a
moment.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
if
the
castle
should
fall?вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™d
like
that,
wouldnвЂ™t
you?вЂќ
Cersei
did
not
wait
for
a
denial.
вЂњIf
IвЂ™m
not
betrayed
by
my
own
guards,
I
may
be
able
to
hold
here
for
a
time.
Then
I
can
go
to
the
walls
and
offer
to
yield
to
Lord
Stannis
in
person.
That
will
spare
us
the
worst.
But
if
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast
should
fall
before
Stannis
can
come
up,
why
then,
most
of
my
guests
are
in
for
a
bit
of
rape,
IвЂ™d
say.
And
you
should
never
rule
out
mutilation,
torture,
and
murder
at
times
like
these.вЂќ

Sansa
was
horrified.
вЂњThese
are
women,
unarmed,
and
gently
born.вЂќ

вЂњTheir
birth
protects
them,вЂќ
Cersei
admitted,
вЂњthough
not
as
much
as
youвЂ™d
think.
Each
oneвЂ™s
worth
a
good
ransom,
but
after
the
madness
of
battle,
soldiers
often
seem
to
want
flesh
more
than
coin.
Even
so,
a
golden
shield
is
better
than
none.
Out
in
the
streets,
the
women
wonвЂ™t
be
treated
near
as
tenderly.
Nor
will
our
servants.
Pretty
things
like
that
serving
wench
of
Lady
TandaвЂ™s
could
be
in
for
a
lively
night,
but
donвЂ™t
imagine
the
old
and
the
infirm
and
the
ugly
will
be
spared.
Enough
drink
will
make
blind
washerwomen
and
reeking
pig
girls
seem
as
comely
as
you,
sweetling.

вЂњMe?вЂќ

вЂњTry
not
to
sound
so
like
a
mouse,
Sansa.
YouвЂ™re
a
woman
now,
remember?
And
betrothed
to
my
firstborn.вЂќ
The
queen
sipped
at
her
wine.
вЂњWere
it
anyone
else
outside
the
gates,
I
might
hope
to
beguile
him.
But
this
is
Stannis
Baratheon.
IвЂ™d
have
a
better
chance
of
seducing
his
horse.вЂќ
She
noticed
the
look
on
SansaвЂ™s
face,
and
laughed.
вЂњHave
I
shocked
you,
my
lady?вЂќ
She
leaned
close.
вЂњYou
little
fool.
Tears
are
not
a
womanвЂ™s
only
weapon.
YouвЂ™ve
got
another
one
between
your
legs,
and
youвЂ™d
best
learn
to
use
it.
YouвЂ™ll
find
men
use
their
swords
freely
enough.
Both
kinds
of
swords.вЂќ

Sansa
was
spared
the
need
to
reply
when
two
Kettleblacks
reentered
the
hall.
Ser
Osmund
and
his
brothers
had
become
great
favorites
about
the
castle;
they
were
always
ready
with
a
smile
and
a
jest,
and
got
on
with
grooms
and
huntsmen
as
well
as
they
did
with
knights
and
squires.
With
the
serving
wenches
they
got
on
best
of
all,
it
was
gossiped.
Of
late
Ser
Osmund
had
taken
Sandor
CleganeвЂ™s
place
by
JoffreyвЂ™s
side,
and
Sansa
had
heard
the
women
at
the
washing
well
saying
he
was
as
strong
as
the
Hound,
only
younger
and
faster.
If
that
was
so,
she
wondered
why
she
had
never
once
heard
of
these
Kettleblacks
before
Ser
Osmund
was
named
to
the
Kingsguard.

Osney
was
all
smiles
as
he
knelt
beside
the
queen.
вЂњThe
hulks
have
gone
up,
YвЂ™Grace.
The
whole
BlackwaterвЂ™s
awash
with
wildfire.
A
hundred
ships
burning,
maybe
more.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
my
son?вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
at
the
Mud
Gate
with
the
Hand
and
the
Kingsguard,
YвЂ™Grace.
He
spoke
to
the
archers
on
the
hoardings
before,
and
gave
them
a
few
tips
on
handling
a
crossbow,
he
did.
All
agree,
heвЂ™s
a
right
brave
boy.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™d
best
remain
a
right
live
boy.вЂќ
Cersei
turned
to
his
brother
Osfryd,
who
was
taller,
sterner,
and
wore
a
drooping
black
mustache.
вЂњYes?вЂќ

Osfryd
had
donned
a
steel
halfhelm
over
his
long
black
hair,
and
the
look
on
his
face
was
grim,
вЂњYвЂ™Grace,вЂќ
he
said
quietly,
вЂњthe
boys
caught
a
groom
and
two
maidservants
trying
to
sneak
out
a
postern
with
three
of
the
kingвЂ™s
horses.вЂќ

вЂњThe
nightвЂ™s
first
traitors,вЂќ
the
queen
said,
вЂњbut
not
the
last,
I
fear.
Have
Ser
Ilyn
see
to
them,
and
put
their
heads
on
pikes
outside
the
stables
as
a
warning.вЂќ
As
they
left,
she
turned
to
Sansa.
вЂњAnother
lesson
you
should
learn,
if
you
hope
to
sit
beside
my
son.
Be
gentle
on
a
night
like
this
and
youвЂ™ll
have
treasons
popping
up
all
about
you
like
mushrooms
after
a
hard
rain.
The
only
way
to
keep
your
people
loyal
is
to
make
certain
they
fear
you
more
than
they
do
the
enemy.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
remember,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
said
Sansa,
though
she
had
always
heard
that
love
was
a
surer
route
to
the
peopleвЂ™s
loyalty
than
fear.
If
I
am
ever
a
queen,
IвЂ™ll
make
them
love
me.

Crabclaw
pies
followed
the
salad.
Then
came
mutton
roasted
with
leeks
and
carrots,
served
in
trenchers
of
hollowed
bread.
Lollys
ate
too
fast,
got
sick,
and
retched
all
over
herself
and
her
sister.
Lord
Gyles
coughed,
drank,
coughed,
drank,
and
passed
out.
The
queen
gazed
down
in
disgust
to
where
he
sprawled
with
his
face
in
his
trencher
and
his
hand
in
a
puddle
of
wine.
вЂњThe
gods
must
have
been
mad
to
waste
manhood
on
the
likes
of
him,
and
I
must
have
been
mad
to
demand
his
release.вЂќ

Osfryd
Kettleblack
returned,
crimson
cloak
swirling.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
folks
gathering
in
the
square,
YвЂ™Grace,
asking
to
take
refuge
in
the
castle.
Not
a
mob,
rich
merchants
and
the
like.вЂќ

вЂњCommand
them
to
return
to
their
homes,вЂќ
the
queen
said.
вЂњIf
they
wonвЂ™t
go,
have
our
crossbowmen
kill
a
few.
No
sorties;
I
wonвЂ™t
have
the
gates
opened
for
any
reason.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
command.вЂќ
He
bowed
and
moved
off.

The
queenвЂ™s
face
was
hard
and
angry.
вЂњWould
that
I
could
take
a
sword
to
their
necks
myself.вЂќ
Her
voice
was
starting
to
slur.
вЂњWhen
we
were
little,
Jaime
and
I
were
so
much
alike
that
even
our
lord
father
could
not
tell
us
apart.
Sometimes
as
a
lark
we
would
dress
in
each
otherвЂ™s
clothes
and
spend
a
whole
day
each
as
the
other.
Yet
even
so,
when
Jaime
was
given
his
first
sword,
there
was
none
for
me.
вЂWhat
do
I
get?вЂ™
I
remember
asking.
We
were
so
much
alike,
I
could
never
understand
why
they
treated
us
so
differently.
Jaime
learned
to
fight
with
sword
and
lance
and
mace,
while
I
was
taught
to
smile
and
sing
and
please.
He
was
heir
to
Casterly
Rock,
while
I
was
to
be
sold
to
some
stranger
like
a
horse,
to
be
ridden
whenever
my
new
owner
liked,
beaten
whenever
he
liked,
and
cast
aside
in
time
for
a
younger
filly.
JaimeвЂ™s
lot
was
to
be
glory
and
power,
while
mine
was
birth
and
moonblood.вЂќ

вЂњBut
you
were
queen
of
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms,вЂќ
Sansa
said.

вЂњWhen
it
comes
to
swords,
a
queen
is
only
a
woman
after
all.вЂќ

CerseiвЂ™s
wine
cup
was
empty.
The
page
moved
to
fill
it
again,
but
she
turned
it
over
and
shook
her
head.
вЂњNo
more.
I
must
keep
a
clear
head.вЂќ

The
last
course
was
goat
cheese
served
with
baked
apples.
The
scent
of
cinnamon
filled
the
hall
as
Osney
Kettleblack
slipped
in
to
kneel
once
more
between
them.
вЂњYвЂ™Grace,вЂќ
he
murmured.
вЂњStannis
has
landed
men
on
the
tourney
grounds,
and
thereвЂ™s
more
coming
across.
The
Mud
GateвЂ™s
under
attack,
and
theyвЂ™ve
brought
a
ram
to
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate.
The
ImpвЂ™s
gone
out
to
drive
them
off.вЂќ

вЂњThat
will
fill
them
with
fear,вЂќ
the
queen
said
dryly.
вЂњHe
hasnвЂ™t
taken
Joff,
I
hope.вЂќ

вЂњNo,
YвЂ™Grace,
the
kingвЂ™s
with
my
brother
at
the
Whores,
flinging
Antler
Men
into
the
river.вЂќ

вЂњWith
the
Mud
Gate
under
assault?
Folly.
Tell
Ser
Osmund
I
want
him
out
of
there
at
once,
itвЂ™s
too
dangerous.
Fetch
him
back
to
the
castle.вЂќ

вЂњThe
Imp
saidвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
what
I
said
that
ought
concern
you.вЂќ
CerseiвЂ™s
eyes
narrowed.
вЂњYour
brother
will
do
as
heвЂ™s
told,
or
IвЂ™ll
see
to
it
that
he
leads
the
next
sortie
himself,
and
youвЂ™ll
go
with
him.вЂќ

After
the
meal
had
been
cleared
away,
many
of
the
guests
asked
leave
to
go
to
the
sept.
Cersei
graciously
granted
their
request.
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughters
were
among
those
who
fled.
For
those
who
remained,
a
singer
was
brought
forth
to
fill
the
hall
with
the
sweet
music
of
the
high
harp.
He
sang
of
Jonquil
and
Florian,
of
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
and
his
love
for
his
brotherвЂ™s
queen,
of
NymeriaвЂ™s
ten
thousand
ships.
They
were
beautiful
songs,
but
terribly
sad.
Several
of
the
women
began
to
weep,
and
Sansa
felt
her
own
eyes
growing
moist.

вЂњVery
good,
dear.вЂќ
The
queen
leaned
close.
вЂњYou
want
to
practice
those
tears.
YouвЂ™ll
need
them
for
King
Stannis.вЂќ

Sansa
shifted
nervously.
вЂњYour
Grace?вЂќ

вЂњOh,
spare
me
your
hollow
courtesies.
Matters
must
have
reached
a
desperate
strait
out
there
if
they
need
a
dwarf
to
lead
them,
so
you
might
as
well
take
off
your
mask.
I
know
all
about
your
little
treasons
in
the
godswood.вЂќ

вЂњThe
godswood?вЂќ
DonвЂ™t
look
at
Ser
Dontos,
donвЂ™t,
donвЂ™t,
Sansa
told
herself.
She
doesnвЂ™t
know,
no
one
knows,
Dontos
promised
me,
my
Florian
would
never
fail
me.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
done
no
treasons.
I
only
visit
the
godswood
to
pray.вЂќ

вЂњFor
Stannis.
Or
your
brother,
itвЂ™s
all
the
same.
Why
else
seek
your
fatherвЂ™s
gods?
YouвЂ™re
praying
for
our
defeat.
What
would
you
call
that,
if
not
treason?вЂќ

вЂњI
pray
for
Joffrey,вЂќ
she
insisted
nervously.

вЂњWhy,
because
he
treats
you
so
sweetly?вЂќ
The
queen
took
a
flagon
of
sweet
plum
wine
from
a
passing
serving
girl
and
filled
SansaвЂ™s
cup.
вЂњDrink,вЂќ
she
commanded
coldly.
вЂњPerhaps
it
will
give
you
the
courage
to
deal
with
truth
for
a
change.вЂќ

Sansa
lifted
the
cup
to
her
lips
and
took
a
sip.
The
wine
was
cloyingly
sweet,
but
very
strong.

вЂњYou
can
do
better
than
that,вЂќ
Cersei
said.
вЂњDrain
the
cup,
Sansa.
Your
queen
commands
you.вЂќ
It
almost
gagged
her,
but
Sansa
emptied
the
cup,
gulping
down
the
thick
sweet
wine
until
her
head
was
swimming.

вЂњMore?вЂќ
Cersei
asked.

вЂњNo.
Please.вЂќ

The
queen
looked
displeased.
вЂњWhen
you
asked
about
Ser
Ilyn
earlier,
I
lied
to
you.
Would
you
like
to
hear
the
truth,
Sansa?
Would
you
like
to
know
why
heвЂ™s
really
here?вЂќ

She
did
not
dare
answer,
but
it
did
not
matter.
The
queen
raised
a
hand
and
beckoned,
never
waiting
for
a
reply.
Sansa
had
not
even
seen
Ser
Ilyn
return
to
the
hall,
but
suddenly
there
he
was,
striding
from
the
shadows
behind
the
dais
as
silent
as
a
cat.
He
carried
Ice
unsheathed.
Her
father
had
always
cleaned
the
blade
in
the
godswood
after
he
took
a
manвЂ™s
head,
Sansa
recalled,
but
Ser
Ilyn
was
not
so
fastidious.
There
was
blood
drying
on
the
rippling
steel,
the
red
already
fading
to
brown.
вЂњTell
Lady
Sansa
why
I
keep
you
by
us,вЂќ
said
Cersei.

Ser
Ilyn
opened
his
mouth
and
emitted
a
choking
rattle.
His
pox-scarred
face
had
no
expression.

вЂњHeвЂ™s
here
for
us,
he
says,вЂќ
the
queen
said.
вЂњStannis
may
take
the
city
and
he
may
take
the
throne,
but
I
will
not
suffer
him
to
judge
me.
I
do
not
mean
for
him
to
have
us
alive.вЂќ

вЂњUs?вЂќ

вЂњYou
heard
me.
So
perhaps
you
had
best
pray
again,
Sansa,
and
for
a
different
outcome.
The
Starks
will
have
no
joy
from
the
fall
of
House
Lannister,
I
promise
you.вЂќ
She
reached
out
and
touched
SansaвЂ™s
hair,
brushing
it
lightly
away
from
her
neck.





TYRION

The
slot
in
his
helm
limited
TyrionвЂ™s
vision
to
what
was
before
him,
but
when
he
turned
his
head
he
saw
three
galleys
beached
on
the
tourney
grounds,
and
a
fourth,
larger
than
the
others,
standing
well
out
into
the
river,
firing
barrels
of
burning
pitch
from
a
catapult.

вЂњWedge,вЂќ
Tyrion
commanded
as
his
men
streamed
out
of
the
sally
port.
They
formed
up
in
spearhead,
with
him
at
the
point.
Ser
Mandon
Moore
took
the
place
to
his
right,
flames
shimmering
against
the
white
enamel
of
his
armor,
his
dead
eyes
shining
passionlessly
through
his
helm.
He
rode
a
coal-black
horse
barded
all
in
white,
with
the
pure
white
shield
of
the
Kingsguard
strapped
to
his
arm.
On
the
left,
Tyrion
was
surprised
to
see
Podrick
Payne,
a
sword
in
his
hand.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
too
young,вЂќ
he
said
at
once.
вЂњGo
back.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
your
squire,
my
lord.вЂќ

Tyrion
could
spare
no
time
for
argument.
вЂњWith
me,
then.
Stay
close.вЂќ
He
kicked
his
horse
into
motion.

They
rode
knee
to
knee,
following
the
line
of
the
looming
walls.
JoffreyвЂ™s
standard
streamed
crimson
and
gold
from
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
staff,
stag
and
lion
dancing
hoof
to
paw.
They
went
from
a
walk
to
a
trot,
wheeling
wide
around
the
base
of
the
tower.
Arrows
darted
from
the
city
walls
while
stones
spun
and
tumbled
overhead,
crashing
down
blindly
onto
earth
and
water,
steel
and
flesh.
Ahead
loomed
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate
and
a
surging
mob
of
soldiers
wrestling
with
a
huge
ram,
a
shaft
of
black
oak
with
an
iron
head.
Archers
off
the
ships
surrounded
them,
loosing
their
shafts
at
whatever
defenders
showed
themselves
on
the
gatehouse
walls.
вЂњLances,вЂќ
Tyrion
commanded.
He
sped
to
a
canter.

The
ground
was
sodden
and
slippery,
equal
parts
mud
and
blood.
His
stallion
stumbled
over
a
corpse,
his
hooves
sliding
and
churning
the
earth,
and
for
an
instant
Tyrion
feared
his
charge
would
end
with
him
tumbling
from
the
saddle
before
he
even
reached
the
foe,
but
somehow
he
and
his
horse
both
managed
to
keep
their
balance.
Beneath
the
gate
men
were
turning,
hurriedly
trying
to
brace
for
the
shock.
Tyrion
lifted
his
axe
and
shouted,
вЂњKingвЂ™s
Landing!вЂќ
Other
voices
took
up
the
cry,
and
now
the
arrowhead
flew,
a
long
scream
of
steel
and
silk,
pounding
hooves
and
sharp
blades
kissed
by
fire.

Ser
Mandon
dropped
the
point
of
his
lance
at
the
last
possible
instant,
and
drove
JoffreyвЂ™s
banner
through
the
chest
of
a
man
in
a
studded
jerkin,
lifting
him
full
off
his
feet
before
the
shaft
snapped.
Ahead
of
Tyrion
was
a
knight
whose
surcoat
showed
a
fox
peering
through
a
ring
of
flowers.
Florent
was
his
first
thought,
but
helmless
ran
a
close
second.
He
smashed
the
man
in
the
face
with
all
the
weight
of
axe
and
arm
and
charging
horse,
taking
off
half
his
head.
The
shock
of
impact
numbed
his
shoulder.
Shagga
would
laugh
at
me,
he
thought,
riding
on.

A
spear
thudded
against
his
shield.
Pod
galloped
beside
him,
slashing
down
at
every
foe
they
passed.
Dimly,
he
heard
cheers
from
the
men
on
the
walls.
The
battering
ram
crashed
down
into
the
mud,
forgotten
in
an
instant
as
its
handlers
fled
or
turned
to
fight.
Tyrion
rode
down
an
archer,
opened
a
spearman
from
shoulder
to
armpit,
glanced
a
blow
off
a
swordfish-crested
helm.
At
the
ram
his
big
red
reared
but
the
black
stallion
leapt
the
obstacle
smoothly
and
Ser
Mandon
flashed
past
him,
death
in
snow-white
silk.
His
sword
sheared
off
limbs,
cracked
heads,
broke
shields
asunderвЂ”though
few
enough
of
the
enemy
had
made
it
across
the
river
with
shields
intact.

Tyrion
urged
his
mount
over
the
ram.
Their
foes
were
fleeing.
He
moved
his
head
right
to
left
and
back
again,
but
saw
no
sign
of
Podrick
Payne.
An
arrow
clattered
against
his
cheek,
missing
his
eye
slit
by
an
inch.
His
jolt
of
fear
almost
unhorsed
him.
If
IвЂ™m
to
sit
here
like
a
stump,
I
had
as
well
paint
a
target
on
my
breastplate.

He
spurred
his
horse
back
into
motion,
trotting
over
and
around
a
scatter
of
corpses.
Downriver,
the
Blackwater
was
jammed
with
the
hulks
of
burning
galleys.
Patches
of
wildfire
still
floated
atop
the
water,
sending
fiery
green
plumes
swirling
twenty
feet
into
the
air.
They
had
dispersed
the
men
on
the
battering
ram,
but
he
could
see
fighting
all
along
the
riverfront.
Ser
Balon
SwannвЂ™s
men,
most
like,
or
LancelвЂ™s,
trying
to
throw
the
enemy
back
into
the
water
as
they
swarmed
ashore
off
the
burning
ships.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
ride
for
the
Mud
Gate,вЂќ
he
commanded.

Ser
Mandon
shouted,
вЂњThe
Mud
Gate!вЂќ
And
they
were
off
again.
вЂњKingвЂ™s
Landing!вЂќ
his
men
cried
raggedly,
and
вЂњHalfman!
Halfman!вЂќ
He
wondered
who
had
taught
them
that.
Through
the
steel
and
padding
of
his
helm,
he
heard
anguished
screams,
the
hungry
crackle
of
flame,
the
shuddering
of
warhorns,
and
the
brazen
blast
of
trumpets.
Fire
was
everywhere.
Gods
be
good,
no
wonder
the
Hound
was
frightened.
ItвЂ™s
the
flames
he
fearsвЂ¦

A
splintering
crash
rang
across
the
Blackwater
as
a
stone
the
size
of
a
horse
landed
square
amidships
on
one
of
the
galleys.
Ours
or
theirs?
Through
the
roiling
smoke,
he
could
not
tell.
His
wedge
was
gone;
every
man
was
his
own
battle
now.
I
should
have
turned
back,
he
thought,
riding
on.

The
axe
was
heavy
in
his
fist.
A
handful
still
followed
him,
the
rest
dead
or
fled.
He
had
to
wrestle
his
stallion
to
keep
his
head
to
the
east.
The
big
destrier
liked
fire
no
more
than
Sandor
Clegane
had,
but
the
horse
was
easier
to
cow.

Men
were
crawling
from
the
river,
men
burned
and
bleeding,
coughing
up
water,
staggering,
most
dying.
He
led
his
troop
among
them,
delivering
quicker
cleaner
deaths
to
those
strong
enough
to
stand.
The
war
shrank
to
the
size
of
his
eye
slit.
Knights
twice
his
size
fled
from
him,
or
stood
and
died.
They
seemed
little
things,
and
fearful.
вЂњLannister!вЂќ
he
shouted,
slaying.
His
arm
was
red
to
the
elbow,
glistening
in
the
light
off
the
river.
When
his
horse
reared
again,
he
shook
his
axe
at
the
stars
and
heard
them
call
out
вЂњHalfman!
Halfman!вЂќ
Tyrion
felt
drunk.

The
battle
fever.
He
had
never
thought
to
experience
it
himself,
though
Jaime
had
told
him
of
it
often
enough.
How
time
seemed
to
blur
and
slow
and
even
stop,
how
the
past
and
the
future
vanished
until
there
was
nothing
but
the
instant,
how
fear
fled,
and
thought
fled,
and
even
your
body.
вЂњYou
donвЂ™t
feel
your
wounds
then,
or
the
ache
in
your
back
from
the
weight
of
the
armor,
or
the
sweat
running
down
into
your
eyes.
You
stop
feeling,
you
stop
thinking,
you
stop
being
you,
there
is
only
the
fight,
the
foe,
this
man
and
then
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next,
and
you
know
they
are
afraid
and
tired
but
youвЂ™re
not,
youвЂ™re
alive,
and
death
is
all
around
you
but
their
swords
move
so
slowly,
you
can
dance
through
them
laughing.вЂќ
Battle
fever.
I
am
half
a
man
and
drunk
with
slaughter,
let
them
kill
me
if
they
can!

They
tried.
Another
spearman
ran
at
him.
Tyrion
lopped
off
the
head
of
his
spear,
then
his
hand,
then
his
arm,
trotting
around
him
in
a
circle.
An
archer,
bowless,
thrust
at
him
with
an
arrow,
holding
it
as
if
it
were
a
knife.
The
destrier
kicked
at
the
manвЂ™s
thigh
to
send
him
sprawling,
and
Tyrion
barked
laughter.
He
rode
past
a
banner
planted
in
the
mud,
one
of
StannisвЂ™s
fiery
hearts,
and
chopped
the
staff
in
two
with
a
swing
of
his
axe.
A
knight
rose
up
from
nowhere
to
hack
at
his
shield
with
a
two-handed
greatsword,
again
and
again,
until
someone
thrust
a
dagger
under
his
arm.
One
of
TyrionвЂ™s
men,
perhaps.
He
never
saw.

вЂњI
yield,
ser,вЂќ
a
different
knight
called
out,
farther
down
the
river.
вЂњYield.
Ser
knight,
I
yield
to
you.
My
pledge,
here,
here.вЂќ
The
man
lay
in
a
puddle
of
black
water,
offering
up
a
lobstered
gauntlet
in
token
of
submission.
Tyrion
had
to
lean
down
to
take
it
from
him.
As
he
did,
a
pot
of
wildfire
burst
overhead,
spraying
green
flame.
In
the
sudden
stab
of
light
he
saw
that
the
puddle
was
not
black
but
red.
The
gauntlet
still
had
the
knightвЂ™s
hand
in
it.
He
flung
it
back.
вЂњYield,вЂќ
the
man
sobbed
hopelessly,
helplessly.
Tyrion
reeled
away.

A
man-at-arms
grabbed
the
bridle
of
his
horse
and
thrust
at
TyrionвЂ™s
face
with
a
dagger.
He
knocked
the
blade
aside
and
buried
the
axe
in
the
nape
of
the
manвЂ™s
neck.
As
he
was
wresting
it
free,
a
blaze
of
white
appeared
at
the
edge
of
his
vision.
Tyrion
turned,
thinking
to
find
Ser
Mandon
Moore
beside
him
again,
but
this
was
a
different
white
knight.
Ser
Balon
Swann
wore
the
same
armor,
but
his
horse
trappings
bore
the
battling
black-and-white
swans
of
his
House.
HeвЂ™s
more
a
spotted
knight
than
a
white
one,
Tyrion
thought
inanely.
Every
bit
of
Ser
Balon
was
spattered
with
gore
and
smudged
by
smoke.
He
raised
his
mace
to
point
downriver.
Bits
of
brain
and
bone
clung
to
its
head.
вЂњMy
lord,
look.вЂќ

Tyrion
swung
his
horse
about
to
peer
down
the
Blackwater.
The
current
still
flowed
black
and
strong
beneath,
but
the
surface
was
a
roil
of
blood
and
flame.
The
sky
was
red
and
orange
and
garish
green.
вЂњWhat?вЂќ
he
said.
Then
he
saw.

Steel-clad
men-at-arms
were
clambering
off
a
broken
galley
that
had
smashed
into
a
pier.
So
many,
where
are
they
coming
from?
Squinting
into
the
smoke
and
glare,
Tyrion
followed
them
back
out
into
the
river.
Twenty
galleys
were
jammed
together
out
there,
maybe
more,
it
was
hard
to
count.
Their
oars
were
crossed,
their
hulls
locked
together
with
grappling
lines,
they
were
impaled
on
each
otherвЂ™s
rams,
tangled
in
webs
of
fallen
rigging.
One
great
hulk
floated
hull
up
between
two
smaller
ships.
Wrecks,
but
packed
so
closely
that
it
was
possible
to
leap
from
one
deck
to
the
other
and
so
cross
the
Blackwater.

Hundreds
of
Stannis
BaratheonвЂ™s
boldest
were
doing
just
that.
Tyrion
saw
one
great
fool
of
a
knight
trying
to
ride
across,
urging
a
terrified
horse
over
gunwales
and
oars,
across
tilting
decks
slick
with
blood
and
crackling
with
green
fire.
We
made
them
a
bloody
bridge,
he
thought
in
dismay.
Parts
of
the
bridge
were
sinking
and
other
parts
were
afire
and
the
whole
thing
was
creaking
and
shifting
and
like
to
burst
asunder
at
any
moment,
but
that
did
not
seem
to
stop
them.
вЂњThose
are
brave
men,вЂќ
he
told
Ser
Balon
in
admiration.
вЂњLetвЂ™s
go
kill
them.вЂќ

He
led
them
through
the
guttering
fires
and
the
soot
and
ash
of
the
riverfront,
pounding
down
a
long
stone
quay
with
his
own
men
and
Ser
BalonвЂ™s
behind
him.
Ser
Mandon
fell
in
with
them,
his
shield
a
ragged
ruin.
Smoke
and
cinders
swirled
through
the
air,
and
the
foe
broke
before
their
charge,
throwing
themselves
back
into
the
water,
knocking
over
other
men
as
they
fought
to
climb
up.
The
foot
of
the
bridge
was
a
half-sunken
enemy
galley
with
Dragonsbane
painted
on
her
prow,
her
bottom
ripped
out
by
one
of
the
sunken
hulks
Tyrion
had
placed
between
the
quays.
A
spearman
wearing
the
red
crab
badge
of
House
Celtigar
drove
the
point
of
his
weapon
up
through
the
chest
of
Balon
SwannвЂ™s
horse
before
he
could
dismount,
spilling
the
knight
from
the
saddle.
Tyrion
hacked
at
the
manвЂ™s
head
as
he
flashed
by,
and
by
then
it
was
too
late
to
rein
up.
His
stallion
leapt
from
the
end
of
the
quay
and
over
a
splintered
gunwale,
landing
with
a
splash
and
a
scream
in
ankle-deep
water.
TyrionвЂ™s
axe
went
spinning,
followed
by
Tyrion
himself,
and
the
deck
rose
up
to
give
him
a
wet
smack.

Madness
followed.
His
horse
had
broken
a
leg
and
was
screaming
horribly.
Somehow
he
managed
to
draw
his
dagger,
and
slit
the
poor
creatureвЂ™s
throat.
The
blood
gushed
out
in
a
scarlet
fountain,
drenching
his
arms
and
chest.
He
found
his
feet
again
and
lurched
to
the
rail,
and
then
he
was
fighting,
staggering
and
splashing
across
crooked
decks
awash
with
water.
Men
came
at
him.
Some
he
killed,
some
he
wounded,
and
some
went
away,
but
always
there
were
more.
He
lost
his
knife
and
gained
a
broken
spear,
he
could
not
have
said
how.
He
clutched
it
and
stabbed,
shrieking
curses.
Men
ran
from
him
and
he
ran
after
them,
clambering
up
over
the
rail
to
the
next
ship
and
then
the
next.
His
two
white
shadows
were
always
with
him;
Balon
Swann
and
Mandon
Moore,
beautiful
in
their
pale
plate.
Surrounded
by
a
circle
of
Velaryon
spearmen,
they
fought
back
to
back;
they
made
battle
as
graceful
as
a
dance.

His
own
killing
was
a
clumsy
thing.
He
stabbed
one
man
in
the
kidney
when
his
back
was
turned,
and
grabbed
another
by
the
leg
and
upended
him
into
the
river.
Arrows
hissed
past
his
head
and
clattered
off
his
armor;
one
lodged
between
shoulder
and
breastplate,
but
he
never
felt
it.
A
naked
man
fell
from
the
sky
and
landed
on
the
deck,
body
bursting
like
a
melon
dropped
from
a
tower.
His
blood
spattered
through
the
slit
of
TyrionвЂ™s
helm.
Stones
began
to
plummet
down,
crashing
through
the
decks
and
turning
men
to
pulp,
until
the
whole
bridge
gave
a
shudder
and
twisted
violently
underfoot,
knocking
him
sideways.

Suddenly
the
river
was
pouring
into
his
helm.
He
ripped
it
off
and
crawled
along
the
listing
deck
until
the
water
was
only
neck
deep.
A
groaning
filled
the
air,
like
the
death
cries
of
some
enormous
beast,
The
ship,
he
had
time
to
think,
the
shipвЂ™s
about
to
tear
loose.
The
broken
galleys
were
ripping
apart,
the
bridge
breaking
apart.
No
sooner
had
he
come
to
that
realization
than
he
heard
a
sudden
crack,
loud
as
thunder,
the
deck
lurched
beneath
him,
and
he
slid
back
down
into
the
water.

The
list
was
so
steep
he
had
to
climb
back
up,
hauling
himself
along
a
snapped
line
inch
by
bloody
inch.
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
he
saw
the
hulk
theyвЂ™d
been
tangled
with
drifting
downstream
with
the
current,
spinning
slowly
as
men
leapt
over
her
side.
Some
wore
StannisвЂ™s
flaming
heart,
some
JoffreyвЂ™s
stag-and-lion,
some
other
badges,
but
it
seemed
to
make
no
matter.
Fires
were
burning
upstream
and
down.
On
one
side
of
him
was
a
raging
battle,
a
great
confusion
of
bright
banners
waving
above
a
sea
of
struggling
men,
shield
walls
forming
and
breaking,
mounted
knights
cutting
through
the
press,
dust
and
mud
and
blood
and
smoke.
On
the
other
side,
the
Red
Keep
loomed
high
on
its
hill,
spitting
fire.
They
were
on
the
wrong
sides,
though.
For
a
moment
Tyrion
thought
he
was
going
mad,
that
Stannis
and
the
castle
had
traded
places.
How
could
Stannis
cross
to
the
north
bank?
Belatedly
he
realized
that
the
deck
was
turning,
and
somehow
he
had
gotten
spun
about,
so
castle
and
battle
had
changed
sides.
Battle,
what
battle,
if
Stannis
hasnвЂ™t
crossed
who
is
he
fighting?
Tyrion
was
too
tired
to
make
sense
of
it.
His
shoulder
ached
horribly,
and
when
he
reached
up
to
rub
it
he
saw
the
arrow,
and
remembered.
I
have
to
get
off
this
ship.
Downstream
was
nothing
but
a
wall
of
fire,
and
if
the
wreck
broke
loose
the
current
would
take
him
right
into
it.

Someone
was
calling
his
name
faintly
through
the
din
of
battle.
Tyrion
tried
to
shout
back.
вЂњHere!
Here,
IвЂ™m
here,
help
me!вЂќ
His
voice
sounded
so
thin
he
could
scarcely
hear
himself.
He
pulled
himself
up
the
slanting
deck,
and
grabbed
for
the
rail.
The
hull
slammed
into
the
next
galley
over
and
rebounded
so
violently
he
was
almost
knocked
into
the
water.
Where
had
all
his
strength
gone?
It
was
all
he
could
do
to
hang
on.

вЂњMY
LORD!
TAKE
MY
HAND!
MY
LORD
TYRION!вЂќ

There
on
the
deck
of
the
next
ship,
across
a
widening
gulf
of
black
water,
stood
Ser
Mandon
Moore,
a
hand
extended.
Yellow
and
green
fire
shone
against
the
white
of
his
armor,
and
his
lobstered
gauntlet
was
sticky
with
blood,
but
Tyrion
reached
for
it
all
the
same,
wishing
his
arms
were
longer.
It
was
only
at
the
very
last,
as
their
fingers
brushed
across
the
gap,
that
something
niggled
at
himвЂ¦
Ser
Mandon
was
holding
out
his
left
hand,
whyвЂ¦

Was
that
why
he
reeled
backward,
or
did
he
see
the
sword
after
all?
He
would
never
know.
The
point
slashed
just
beneath
his
eyes,
and
he
felt
its
cold
hard
touch
and
then
a
blaze
of
pain.
His
head
spun
around
as
if
heвЂ™d
been
slapped.
The
shock
of
the
cold
water
was
a
second
slap
more
jolting
than
the
first.
He
flailed
for
something
to
grab
on
to,
knowing
that
once
he
went
down
he
was
not
like
to
come
back
up.
Somehow
his
hand
found
the
splintered
end
of
a
broken
oar.
Clutching
it
tight
as
a
desperate
lover,
he
shinnied
up
foot
by
foot.
His
eyes
were
full
of
water,
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood,
and
his
head
throbbed
horribly.
Gods
give
me
strength
to
reach
the
deckвЂ¦
There
was
nothing
else,
only
the
oar,
the
water,
the
deck.

Finally
he
rolled
over
the
side
and
lay
breathless
and
exhausted,
flat
on
his
back.
Balls
of
green
and
orange
flame
crackled
overhead,
leaving
streaks
between
the
stars.
He
had
a
moment
to
think
how
pretty
it
was
before
Ser
Mandon
blocked
out
the
view.
The
knight
was
a
white
steel
shadow,
his
eyes
shining
darkly
behind
his
helm.
Tyrion
had
no
more
strength
than
a
rag
doll.
Ser
Mandon
put
the
point
of
his
sword
to
the
hollow
of
his
throat
and
curled
both
hands
around
the
hilt.

And
suddenly
he
lurched
to
the
left,
staggering
into
the
rail.
Wood
split,
and
Ser
Mandon
Moore
vanished
with
a
shout
and
a
splash.
An
instant
later,
the
hulls
came
slamming
together
again,
so
hard
the
deck
seemed
to
jump.
Then
someone
was
kneeling
over
him.
вЂњJaime?вЂќ
he
croaked,
almost
choking
on
the
blood
that
filled
his
mouth.
Who
else
would
save
him,
if
not
his
brother?

вЂњBe
still,
my
lord,
youвЂ™re
hurt
bad.вЂќ
A
boyвЂ™s
voice,
that
makes
no
sense,
thought
Tyrion.
It
sounded
almost
like
Pod.





SANSA

When
Ser
Lancel
Lannister
told
the
queen
that
the
battle
was
lost,
she
turned
her
empty
wine
cup
in
her
hands
and
said,
вЂњTell
my
brother,
ser.вЂќ
Her
voice
was
distant,
as
if
the
news
were
of
no
great
interest
to
her.

вЂњYour
brotherвЂ™s
likely
dead.вЂќ
Ser
LancelвЂ™s
surcoat
was
soaked
with
the
blood
seeping
out
under
his
arm.
When
he
had
arrived
in
the
hall,
the
sight
of
him
had
made
some
of
the
guests
scream.
вЂњHe
was
on
the
bridge
of
boats
when
it
broke
apart,
we
think.
Ser
MandonвЂ™s
likely
gone
as
well,
and
no
one
can
find
the
Hound.
Gods
be
damned,
Cersei,
why
did
you
have
them
fetch
Joffrey
back
to
the
castle?
The
gold
cloaks
are
throwing
down
their
spears
and
running,
hundreds
of
them.
When
they
saw
the
king
leaving,
they
lost
all
heart.
The
whole
BlackwaterвЂ™s
awash
with
wrecks
and
fire
and
corpses,
but
we
could
have
held
ifвЂ”вЂќ

Osney
Kettleblack
pushed
past
him.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
fighting
on
both
sides
of
the
river
now,
YвЂ™Grace.
It
may
be
that
some
of
StannisвЂ™s
lords
are
fighting
each
other,
no
oneвЂ™s
sure,
itвЂ™s
all
confused
over
there.
The
HoundвЂ™s
gone,
no
one
knows
where,
and
Ser
BalonвЂ™s
fallen
back
inside
the
city.
The
riversideвЂ™s
theirs.
TheyвЂ™re
ramming
at
the
KingвЂ™s
Gate
again,
and
Ser
LancelвЂ™s
right,
your
men
are
deserting
the
walls
and
killing
their
own
officers.
ThereвЂ™s
mobs
at
the
Iron
Gate
and
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
fighting
to
get
out,
and
Flea
BottomвЂ™s
one
great
drunken
riot.вЂќ

Gods
be
good,
Sansa
thought,
it
is
happening,
JoffreyвЂ™s
lost
his
head
and
so
have
I.
She
looked
for
Ser
Ilyn,
but
the
KingвЂ™s
Justice
was
not
to
be
seen.
I
can
feel
him,
though.
HeвЂ™s
close,
IвЂ™ll
not
escape
him,
heвЂ™ll
have
my
head.

Strangely
calm,
the
queen
turned
to
his
brother
Osfryd.
вЂњRaise
the
drawbridge
and
bar
the
doors.
No
one
enters
or
leaves
MaegorвЂ™s
without
my
leave.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
about
them
women
who
went
to
pray?вЂќ

вЂњThey
chose
to
leave
my
protection.
Let
them
pray;
perhaps
the
gods
will
defend
them.
WhereвЂ™s
my
son?вЂќ

вЂњThe
castle
gatehouse.
He
wanted
to
command
the
crossbowmen.
ThereвЂ™s
a
mob
howling
outside,
half
of
them
gold
cloaks
who
came
with
him
when
we
left
the
Mud
Gate.вЂќ

вЂњBring
him
inside
MaegorвЂ™s
now.вЂќ

вЂњNo!вЂќ
Lancel
was
so
angry
he
forgot
to
keep
his
voice
down.
Heads
turned
toward
them
as
he
shouted,
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
have
the
Mud
Gate
all
over
again.
Let
him
stay
where
he
is,
heвЂ™s
the
kingвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
my
son.вЂќ
Cersei
Lannister
rose
to
her
feet.
вЂњYou
claim
to
be
a
Lannister
as
well,
cousin,
prove
it.
Osfryd,
why
are
you
standing
there?
Now
means
today.вЂќ

Osfryd
Kettleblack
hurried
from
the
hall,
his
brother
with
him.
Many
of
the
guests
were
rushing
out
as
well.
Some
of
the
women
were
weeping,
some
praying.
Others
simply
remained
at
the
tables
and
called
for
more
wine.
вЂњCersei,вЂќ
Ser
Lancel
pleaded,
вЂњif
we
lose
the
castle,
Joffrey
will
be
killed
in
any
case,
you
know
that.
Let
him
stay,
IвЂ™ll
keep
him
by
me,
I
swearвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњGet
out
of
my
way.вЂќ
Cersei
slammed
her
open
palm
into
his
wound.
Ser
Lancel
cried
out
in
pain
and
almost
fainted
as
the
queen
swept
from
the
room.
She
spared
Sansa
not
so
much
as
a
glance.
SheвЂ™s
forgotten
me.
Ser
Ilyn
will
kill
me
and
she
wonвЂ™t
even
think
about
it.

вЂњOh,
gods,вЂќ
an
old
woman
wailed.
вЂњWeвЂ™re
lost,
the
battleвЂ™s
lost,
sheвЂ™s
running.вЂќ
Several
children
were
crying.
They
can
smell
the
fear.
Sansa
found
herself
alone
on
the
dais.
Should
she
stay
here,
or
run
after
the
queen
and
plead
for
her
life?

She
never
knew
why
she
got
to
her
feet,
but
she
did.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
be
afraid,вЂќ
she
told
them
loudly.
вЂњThe
queen
has
raised
the
drawbridge.
This
is
the
safest
place
in
the
city.
ThereвЂ™s
thick
walls,
the
moat,
the
spikesвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
happened?вЂќ
demanded
a
woman
she
knew
slightly,
the
wife
of
a
lesser
lordling.
вЂњWhat
did
Osney
tell
her?
Is
the
king
hurt,
has
the
city
fallen?вЂќ

вЂњTell
us,вЂќ
someone
else
shouted.
One
woman
asked
about
her
father,
another
her
son.

Sansa
raised
her
hands
for
quiet.
вЂњJoffreyвЂ™s
come
back
to
the
castle.
HeвЂ™s
not
hurt.
TheyвЂ™re
still
fighting,
thatвЂ™s
all
I
know,
theyвЂ™re
fighting
bravely.
The
queen
will
be
back
soon.вЂќ
The
last
was
a
lie,
but
she
had
to
soothe
them.
She
noticed
the
fools
standing
under
the
galley.
вЂњMoon
Boy,
make
us
laugh.вЂќ

Moon
Boy
did
a
cartwheel,
and
vaulted
on
top
of
a
table.
He
grabbed
up
four
wine
cups
and
began
to
juggle
them.
Every
so
often
one
of
them
would
come
down
and
smash
him
in
the
head.
A
few
nervous
laughs
echoed
through
the
hall.
Sansa
went
to
Ser
Lancel
and
knelt
beside
him.
His
wound
was
bleeding
afresh
where
the
queen
had
struck
him.
вЂњMadness,вЂќ
he
gasped.
вЂњGods,
the
Imp
was
right,
was
rightвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHelp
him,вЂќ
Sansa
commanded
two
of
the
serving
men.
One
just
looked
at
her
and
ran,
flagon
and
all.
Other
servants
were
leaving
the
hall
as
well,
but
she
could
not
help
that.
Together,
Sansa
and
the
serving
man
got
the
wounded
knight
back
on
his
feet.
вЂњTake
him
to
Maester
Frenken.вЂќ
Lancel
was
one
of
them,
yet
somehow
she
still
could
not
bring
herself
to
wish
him
dead.
I
am
soft
and
weak
and
stupid,
just
as
Joffrey
says.
I
should
be
killing
him,
not
helping
him.

The
torches
had
begun
to
burn
low,
and
one
or
two
had
flickered
out.
No
one
troubled
to
replace
them.
Cersei
did
not
return.
Ser
Dontos
climbed
the
dais
while
all
eyes
were
on
the
other
fool.
вЂњGo
back
to
your
bedchamber,
sweet
Jonquil,вЂќ
he
whispered.
вЂњLock
yourself
in,
youвЂ™ll
be
safer
there.
IвЂ™ll
come
for
you
when
the
battleвЂ™s
done.вЂќ

Someone
will
come
for
me,
Sansa
thought,
but
will
it
be
you,
or
will
it
be
Ser
Ilyn?
For
a
mad
moment
she
thought
of
begging
Dontos
to
defend
her.
He
had
been
a
knight
too,
trained
with
the
sword
and
sworn
to
defend
the
weak.
No.
He
has
not
the
courage,
or
the
skill.
I
would
only
be
killing
him
as
well.

It
took
all
the
strength
she
had
in
her
to
walk
slowly
from
the
QueenвЂ™s
Ballroom
when
she
wanted
so
badly
to
run.
When
she
reached
the
steps,
she
did
run,
up
and
around
until
she
was
breathless
and
dizzy.
One
of
the
guards
knocked
into
her
on
the
stair.
A
jeweled
wine
cup
and
a
pair
of
silver
candlesticks
spilled
out
of
the
crimson
cloak
heвЂ™d
wrapped
them
in
and
went
clattering
down
the
steps.
He
hurried
after
them,
paying
Sansa
no
mind
once
he
decided
she
was
not
going
to
try
and
take
his
loot.

Her
bedchamber
was
black
as
pitch.
Sansa
barred
the
door
and
fumbled
through
the
dark
to
the
window.
When
she
ripped
back
the
drapes,
her
breath
caught
in
her
throat.

The
southern
sky
was
aswirl
with
glowing,
shifting
colors,
the
reflections
of
the
great
fires
that
burned
below.
Baleful
green
tides
moved
against
the
bellies
of
the
clouds,
and
pools
of
orange
light
spread
out
across
the
heavens.
The
reds
and
yellows
of
common
flame
warred
against
the
emeralds
and
jades
of
wildfire,
each
color
flaring
and
then
fading,
birthing
armies
of
short-lived
shadows
to
die
again
an
instant
later.
Green
dawns
gave
way
to
orange
dusks
in
half
a
heartbeat.
The
air
itself
smelled
burnt,
the
way
a
soup
kettle
sometimes
smelled
if
it
was
left
on
the
fire
too
long
and
all
the
soup
boiled
away.
Embers
drifted
through
the
night
air
like
swarms
of
fireflies.

Sansa
backed
away
from
the
window,
retreating
toward
the
safety
of
her
bed.
IвЂ™ll
go
to
sleep,
she
told
herself,
and
when
I
wake
it
will
be
a
new
day,
and
the
sky
will
be
blue
again.
The
fighting
will
be
done
and
someone
will
tell
me
whether
IвЂ™m
to
live
or
die.
вЂњLady,вЂќ
she
whimpered
softly,
wondering
if
she
would
meet
her
wolf
again
when
she
was
dead.

Then
something
stirred
behind
her,
and
a
hand
reached
out
of
the
dark
and
grabbed
her
wrist.

Sansa
opened
her
mouth
to
scream,
but
another
hand
clamped
down
over
her
face,
smothering
her.
His
fingers
were
rough
and
callused,
and
sticky
with
blood.
вЂњLittle
bird.
I
knew
youвЂ™d
come.вЂќ
The
voice
was
a
drunken
rasp.

Outside,
a
swirling
lance
of
jade
light
spit
at
the
stars,
filling
the
room
with
green
glare.
She
saw
him
for
a
moment,
all
black
and
green,
the
blood
on
his
face
dark
as
tar,
his
eyes
glowing
like
a
dogвЂ™s
in
the
sudden
glare.
Then
the
light
faded
and
he
was
only
a
hulking
darkness
in
a
stained
white
cloak.

вЂњIf
you
scream
IвЂ™ll
kill
you.
Believe
that.вЂќ
He
took
his
hand
from
her
mouth.
Her
breath
was
coming
ragged.
The
Hound
had
a
flagon
of
wine
on
her
bedside
table.
He
took
a
long
pull.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
you
want
to
ask
whoвЂ™s
winning
the
battle,
little
bird?вЂќ

вЂњWho?вЂќ
she
said,
too
frightened
to
defy
him.

The
Hound
laughed.
вЂњI
only
know
whoвЂ™s
lost.
Me.вЂќ

He
is
drunker
than
IвЂ™ve
ever
seen
him.
He
was
sleeping
in
my
bed.
What
does
he
want
here?
вЂњWhat
have
you
lost?вЂќ

вЂњAll.вЂќ
The
burnt
half
of
his
face
was
a
mask
of
dried
blood.
вЂњBloody
dwarf.
Should
have
killed
him.
Years
ago.вЂќ

вЂњHeвЂ™s
dead,
they
say.вЂќ

вЂњDead?
No.
Bugger
that.
I
donвЂ™t
want
him
dead.вЂќ
He
cast
the
empty
flagon
aside.
вЂњI
want
him
burned.
If
the
gods
are
good,
theyвЂ™ll
burn
him,
but
I
wonвЂ™t
be
here
to
see.
IвЂ™m
going.вЂќ

вЂњGoing?вЂќ
She
tried
to
wriggle
free,
but
his
grasp
was
iron.

вЂњThe
little
bird
repeats
whatever
she
hears.
Going,
yes.вЂќ

вЂњWhere
will
you
go?вЂќ

вЂњAway
from
here.
Away
from
the
fires.
Go
out
the
Iron
Gate,
I
suppose.
North
somewhere,
anywhere.вЂќ

вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t
get
out,вЂќ
Sansa
said.
вЂњThe
queenвЂ™s
closed
up
MaegorвЂ™s,
and
the
city
gates
are
shut
as
well.вЂќ

вЂњNot
to
me.
I
have
the
white
cloak.
And
I
have
this.вЂќ
He
patted
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
вЂњThe
man
who
tries
to
stop
me
is
a
dead
man.
Unless
heвЂ™s
on
fire.вЂќ
He
laughed
bitterly.

вЂњWhy
did
you
come
here?вЂќ

вЂњYou
promised
me
a
song,
little
bird.
Have
you
forgotten?вЂќ

She
didnвЂ™t
know
what
he
meant.
She
couldnвЂ™t
sing
for
him
now,
here,
with
the
sky
aswirl
with
fire
and
men
dying
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands.
вЂњI
canвЂ™t,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњLet
me
go,
youвЂ™re
scaring
me.вЂќ

вЂњEverything
scares
you.
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me.вЂќ

The
blood
masked
the
worst
of
his
scars,
but
his
eyes
were
white
and
wide
and
terrifying.
The
burnt
corner
of
his
mouth
twitched
and
twitched
again.
Sansa
could
smell
him;
a
stink
of
sweat
and
sour
wine
and
stale
vomit,
and
over
it
all
the
reek
of
blood,
blood,
blood.

вЂњI
could
keep
you
safe,вЂќ
he
rasped.
вЂњTheyвЂ™re
all
afraid
of
me.
No
one
would
hurt
you
again,
or
IвЂ™d
kill
them.вЂќ
He
yanked
her
closer,
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
he
meant
to
kiss
her.
He
was
too
strong
to
fight.
She
closed
her
eyes,
wanting
it
to
be
over,
but
nothing
happened.
вЂњStill
canвЂ™t
bear
to
look,
can
you?вЂќ
she
heard
him
say.
He
gave
her
arm
a
hard
wrench,
pulling
her
around
and
shoving
her
down
onto
the
bed.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
that
song.
Florian
and
Jonquil,
you
said.вЂќ
His
dagger
was
out,
poised
at
her
throat.
вЂњSing,
little
bird.
Sing
for
your
little
life.вЂќ

Her
throat
was
dry
and
tight
with
fear,
and
every
song
she
had
ever
known
had
fled
from
her
mind.
Please
donвЂ™t
kill
me,
she
wanted
to
scream,
please
donвЂ™t.
She
could
feel
him
twisting
the
point,
pushing
it
into
her
throat,
and
she
almost
closed
her
eyes
again,
but
then
she
remembered.
It
was
not
the
song
of
Florian
and
Jonquil,
but
it
was
a
song.
Her
voice
sounded
small
and
thin
and
tremulous
in
her
ears.

Gentle
Mother,
font
of
mercy,

save
our
sons
from
war,
we
pray,

stay
the
swords
and
stay
the
arrows,

let
them
know
a
better
day.

Gentle
Mother,
strength
of
women,

help
our
daughters
through
this
fray,

soothe
the
wrath
and
tame
the
fury,

teach
us
all
a
kinder
way.

She
had
forgotten
the
other
verses.
When
her
voice
trailed
off,
she
feared
he
might
kill
her,
but
after
a
moment
the
Hound
took
the
blade
from
her
throat,
never
speaking.

Some
instinct
made
her
lift
her
hand
and
cup
his
cheek
with
her
fingers.
The
room
was
too
dark
for
her
to
see
him,
but
she
could
feel
the
stickiness
of
the
blood,
and
a
wetness
that
was
not
blood.
вЂњLittle
bird,вЂќ
he
said
once
more,
his
voice
raw
and
harsh
as
steel
on
stone.
Then
he
rose
from
the
bed.
Sansa
heard
cloth
ripping,
followed
by
the
softer
sound
of
retreating
footsteps.

When
she
crawled
out
of
bed,
long
moments
later,
she
was
alone.
She
found
his
cloak
on
the
floor,
twisted
up
tight,
the
white
wool
stained
by
blood
and
fire.
The
sky
outside
was
darker
by
then,
with
only
a
few
pale
green
ghosts
dancing
against
the
stars.
A
chill
wind
was
blowing,
banging
the
shutters.
Sansa
was
cold.
She
shook
out
the
torn
cloak
and
huddled
beneath
it
on
the
floor,
shivering.

How
long
she
stayed
there
she
could
not
have
said,
but
after
a
time
she
heard
a
bell
ringing,
far
off
across
the
city.
The
sound
was
a
deep-throated
bronze
booming,
coming
faster
with
each
knell.
Sansa
was
wondering
what
it
might
mean
when
a
second
bell
joined
in,
and
a
third,
their
voices
calling
across
the
hills
and
hollows,
the
alleys
and
towers,
to
every
corner
of
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
She
threw
off
the
cloak
and
went
to
her
window.

The
first
faint
hint
of
dawn
was
visible
in
the
east,
and
the
Red
KeepвЂ™s
own
bells
were
ringing
now,
joining
in
the
swelling
river
of
sound
that
flowed
from
the
seven
crystal
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
They
had
rung
the
bells
when
King
Robert
died,
she
remembered,
but
this
was
different,
no
slow
dolorous
death
knell
but
a
joyful
thunder.
She
could
hear
men
shouting
in
the
streets
as
well,
and
something
that
could
only
be
cheers.

It
was
Ser
Dontos
who
brought
her
the
word.
He
staggered
through
her
open
door,
wrapped
her
in
his
flabby
arms,
and
whirled
her
around
and
around
the
room,
whooping
so
incoherently
that
Sansa
understood
not
a
word
of
it.
He
was
as
drunk
as
the
Hound
had
been,
but
in
him
it
was
a
dancing
happy
drunk.
She
was
breathless
and
dizzy
when
he
let
her
down.
вЂњWhat
is
it?вЂќ
She
clutched
at
a
bedpost.
вЂњWhatвЂ™s
happened?
Tell
me!вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
done!
Done!
Done!
The
city
is
saved.
Lord
Stannis
is
dead
,
Lord
Stannis
is
fled,
no
one
knows,
no
one
cares,
his
host
is
broken,
the
dangerвЂ™s
done.
Slaughtered,
scattered,
or
gone
over,
they
say.
Oh,
the
bright
banners!
The
banners,
Jonquil,
the
banners!
Do
you
have
any
wine?
We
ought
to
drink
to
this
day,
yes.
It
means
youвЂ™re
safe,
donвЂ™t
you
see?вЂќ

вЂњTell
me
whatвЂ™s
happened!вЂќ
Sansa
shook
him.

Ser
Dontos
laughed
and
hopped
from
one
leg
to
the
other,
almost
falling.
вЂњThey
came
up
through
the
ashes
while
the
river
was
burning.
The
river,
Stannis
was
neck
deep
in
the
river,
and
they
took
him
from
the
rear.
Oh,
to
be
a
knight
again,
to
have
been
part
of
it!
His
own
men
hardly
fought,
they
say.
Some
ran
but
more
bent
the
knee
and
went
over,
shouting
for
Lord
Renly!
What
must
Stannis
have
thought
when
he
heard
that?
I
had
it
from
Osney
Kettleblack
who
had
it
from
Ser
Osmund,
but
Ser
BalonвЂ™s
back
now
and
his
men
say
the
same,
and
the
gold
cloaks
as
well.
WeвЂ™re
delivered,
sweetling!
They
came
up
the
roseroad
and
along
the
riverbank,
through
all
the
fields
Stannis
had
burned,
the
ashes
puffing
up
around
their
boots
and
turning
all
their
armor
grey,
but
oh!
the
banners
must
have
been
bright,
the
golden
rose
and
golden
lion
and
all
the
others,
the
Marbrand
tree
and
the
Rowan,
TarlyвЂ™s
huntsman
and
RedwyneвЂ™s
grapes
and
Lady
OakheartвЂ™s
leaf.
All
the
westermen,
all
the
power
of
Highgarden
and
Casterly
Rock!
Lord
Tywin
himself
had
their
right
wing
on
the
north
side
of
the
river,
with
Randyll
Tarly
commanding
the
center
and
Mace
Tyrell
the
left,
but
the
vanguard
won
the
fight.
They
plunged
through
Stannis
like
a
lance
through
a
pumpkin,
every
man
of
them
howling
like
some
demon
in
steel.
And
do
you
know
who
led
the
vanguard?
Do
you?
Do
you?
Do
you?вЂќ

вЂњRobb?вЂќ
It
was
too
much
to
be
hoped,
butвЂ¦

вЂњIt
was
Lord
Renly!
Lord
Renly
in
his
green
armor,
with
the
fires
shimmering
off
his
golden
antlers!
Lord
Renly
with
his
tall
spear
in
his
hand!
They
say
he
killed
Ser
Guyard
Morrigen
himself
in
single
combat,
and
a
dozen
other
great
knights
as
well.
It
was
Renly,
it
was
Renly,
it
was
Renly!
Oh!
the
banners,
darling
Sansa!
Oh!
to
be
a
knight!вЂќ





DAENERYS

She
was
breaking
her
fast
on
a
bowl
of
cold
shrimp-and-persimmon
soup
when
Irri
brought
her
a
Qartheen
gown,
an
airy
confection
of
ivory
samite
patterned
with
seed
pearls.
вЂњTake
it
away,вЂќ
Dany
said.
вЂњThe
docks
are
no
place
for
ladyвЂ™s
finery.вЂќ

If
the
Milk
Men
thought
her
such
a
savage,
she
would
dress
the
part
for
them.
When
she
went
to
the
stables,
she
wore
faded
sandsilk
pants
and
woven
grass
sandals.
Her
small
breasts
moved
freely
beneath
a
painted
Dothraki
vest,
and
a
curved
dagger
hung
from
her
medallion
belt.
Jhiqui
had
braided
her
hair
Dothraki
fashion,
and
fastened
a
silver
bell
to
the
end
of
the
braid.
вЂњI
have
won
no
victories,вЂќ
she
tried
telling
her
handmaid
when
the
bell
tinkled
softly.

Jhiqui
disagreed.
вЂњYou
burned
the
maegi
in
their
house
of
dust
and
sent
their
souls
to
hell.вЂќ

That
was
DrogonвЂ™s
victory,
not
mine,
Dany
wanted
to
say,
but
she
held
her
tongue.
The
Dothraki
would
esteem
her
all
the
more
for
a
few
bells
in
her
hair.
She
chimed
as
she
mounted
her
silver
mare,
and
again
with
every
stride,
but
neither
Ser
Jorah
nor
her
bloodriders
made
mention
of
it.
To
guard
her
people
and
her
dragons
in
her
absence,
she
chose
Rakharo.
Jhogo
and
Aggo
would
ride
with
her
to
the
waterfront.

They
left
the
marble
palaces
and
fragrant
gardens
behind
and
made
their
way
through
a
poorer
part
of
the
city
where
modest
brick
houses
turned
blind
walls
to
the
street.
There
were
fewer
horses
and
camels
to
be
seen,
and
a
dearth
of
palanquins,
but
the
streets
teemed
with
children,
beggars,
and
skinny
dogs
the
color
of
sand.
Pale
men
in
dusty
linen
skirts
stood
beneath
arched
doorways
to
watch
them
pass.
They
know
who
I
am,
and
they
do
not
love
me.
Dany
could
tell
from
the
way
they
looked
at
her.

Ser
Jorah
would
sooner
have
tucked
her
inside
her
palanquin,
safely
hidden
behind
silken
curtains,
but
she
refused
him.
She
had
reclined
too
long
on
satin
cushions,
letting
oxen
bear
her
hither
and
yon.
At
least
when
she
rode
she
felt
as
though
she
was
getting
somewhere.

It
was
not
by
choice
that
she
sought
the
waterfront.
She
was
fleeing
again.
Her
whole
life
had
been
one
long
flight,
it
seemed.
She
had
begun
running
in
her
motherвЂ™s
womb,
and
never
once
stopped.
How
often
had
she
and
Viserys
stolen
away
in
the
black
of
night,
a
bare
step
ahead
of
the
UsurperвЂ™s
hired
knives?
But
it
was
run
or
die.
Xaro
had
learned
that
Pyat
Pree
was
gathering
the
surviving
warlocks
together
to
work
ill
on
her.

Dany
had
laughed
when
he
told
her.
вЂњWas
it
not
you
who
told
me
warlocks
were
no
more
than
old
soldiers,
vainly
boasting
of
forgotten
deeds
and
lost
prowess?вЂќ

Xaro
looked
troubled.
вЂњAnd
so
it
was,
then.
But
now?
I
am
less
certain.
It
is
said
that
the
glass
candles
are
burning
in
the
house
of
Urrathon
Night-Walker,
that
have
not
burned
in
a
hundred
years.
Ghost
grass
grows
in
the
Garden
of
Gehane,
phantom
tortoises
have
been
seen
carrying
messages
between
the
windowless
houses
on
WarlockвЂ™s
Way,
and
all
the
rats
in
the
city
are
chewing
off
their
tails.
The
wife
of
Mathos
Mallarawan,
who
once
mocked
a
warlockвЂ™s
drab
moth-eaten
robe,
has
gone
mad
and
will
wear
no
clothes
at
all.
Even
fresh-washed
silks
make
her
feel
as
though
a
thousand
insects
were
crawling
on
her
skin.
And
Blind
Sybassion
the
Eater
of
Eyes
can
see
again,
or
so
his
slaves
do
swear.
A
man
must
wonder.вЂќ
He
sighed.
вЂњThese
are
strange
times
in
Qarth.
And
strange
times
are
bad
for
trade.
It
grieves
me
to
say
so,
yet
it
might
be
best
if
you
left
Qarth
entirely,
and
sooner
rather
than
later.вЂќ
Xaro
stroked
her
fingers
reassuringly.
вЂњYou
need
not
go
alone,
though.
You
have
seen
dark
visions
in
the
Palace
of
Dust,
but
Xaro
has
dreamed
brighter
dreams.
I
see
you
happily
abed,
with
our
child
at
your
breast.
Sail
with
me
around
the
Jade
Sea,
and
we
can
yet
make
it
so!
It
is
not
too
late.
Give
me
a
son,
my
sweet
song
of
joy!вЂќ

Give
you
a
dragon,
you
mean.
вЂњI
will
not
wed
you,
Xaro.вЂќ

His
face
had
grown
cold
at
that.
вЂњThen
go.вЂќ

вЂњBut
where?вЂќ

вЂњSomewhere
far
from
here.вЂќ

Well,
perhaps
it
was
time.
The
people
of
her
khalasar
had
welcomed
the
chance
to
recover
from
the
ravages
of
the
red
waste,
but
now
that
they
were
plump
and
rested
once
again,
they
began
to
grow
unruly.
Dothraki
were
not
accustomed
to
staying
long
in
one
place.
They
were
a
warrior
people,
not
made
for
cities.
Perhaps
she
had
lingered
in
Qarth
too
long,
seduced
by
its
comforts
and
its
beauties.
It
was
a
city
that
always
promised
more
than
it
would
give
you,
it
seemed
to
her,
and
her
welcome
here
had
turned
sour
since
the
House
of
the
Undying
had
collapsed
in
a
great
gout
of
smoke
and
flame.
Overnight
the
Qartheen
had
come
to
remember
that
dragons
were
dangerous.
No
longer
did
they
vie
with
each
other
to
give
her
gifts.
Instead
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood
had
called
openly
for
her
expulsion,
and
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers
for
her
death.
It
was
all
Xaro
could
do
to
keep
the
Thirteen
from
joining
them.

But
where
am
I
to
go?
Ser
Jorah
proposed
that
they
journey
farther
east,
away
from
her
enemies
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Her
bloodriders
would
sooner
have
returned
to
their
great
grass
sea,
even
if
it
meant
braving
the
red
waste
again.
Dany
herself
had
toyed
with
the
idea
of
settling
in
Vaes
Tolorro
until
her
dragons
grew
great
and
strong.
But
her
heart
was
full
of
doubts.
Each
of
these
felt
wrong,
somehowвЂ¦
and
even
when
she
decided
where
to
go,
the
question
of
how
she
would
get
there
remained
troublesome.

Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
would
be
no
help
to
her,
she
knew
that
now.
For
all
his
professions
of
devotion,
he
was
playing
his
own
game,
not
unlike
Pyat
Pree.
The
night
he
asked
her
to
leave,
Dany
had
begged
one
last
favor
of
him.
вЂњAn
army,
is
it?вЂќ
Xaro
asked.
вЂњA
kettle
of
gold?
A
galley,
perhaps?вЂќ

Dany
blushed.
She
hated
begging.
вЂњA
ship,
yes.вЂќ

XaroвЂ™s
eyes
had
glittered
as
brightly
as
the
jewels
in
his
nose.
вЂњI
am
a
trader,
Khaleesi.
So
perhaps
we
should
speak
no
more
of
giving,
but
rather
of
trade.
For
one
of
your
dragons,
you
shall
have
ten
of
the
finest
ships
in
my
fleet.
You
need
only
say
that
one
sweet
word.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
she
said.

вЂњAlas,вЂќ
Xaro
sobbed,
вЂњthat
was
not
the
word
I
meant.вЂќ

вЂњWould
you
ask
a
mother
to
sell
one
of
her
children?вЂќ

вЂњWhyever
not?
They
can
always
make
more.
Mothers
sell
their
children
every
day.вЂќ

вЂњNot
the
Mother
of
Dragons.вЂќ

вЂњNot
even
for
twenty
ships?вЂќ

вЂњNot
for
a
hundred.вЂќ

His
mouth
curled
downward.
вЂњI
do
not
have
a
hundred.
But
you
have
three
dragons.
Grant
me
one,
for
all
my
kindnesses.
You
will
still
have
two
and
thirty
ships
as
well.вЂќ

Thirty
ships
would
be
enough
to
land
a
small
army
on
the
shore
of
Westeros.
But
I
do
not
have
a
small
army.
вЂњHow
many
ships
do
you
own,
Xaro?вЂќ

вЂњEighty-three,
if
one
does
not
count
my
pleasure
barge.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
your
colleagues
in
the
Thirteen?вЂќ

вЂњAmong
us
all,
perhaps
a
thousand.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
Spicers
and
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood?вЂќ

вЂњTheir
trifling
fleets
are
of
no
account.вЂќ

вЂњEven
so,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњtell
me.вЂќ

вЂњTwelve
or
thirteen
hundred
for
the
Spicers.
No
more
than
eight
hundred
for
the
Brotherhood.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
the
AsshaiвЂ™i,
the
Braavosi,
the
Summer
Islanders,
the
Ibbenese,
and
all
the
other
peoples
who
sail
the
great
salt
sea,
how
many
ships
do
they
have?
All
together?вЂќ

вЂњMany
and
more,вЂќ
he
said
irritably.
вЂњWhat
does
this
matter?вЂќ

вЂњI
am
trying
to
set
a
price
on
one
of
the
three
living
dragons
in
the
world.вЂќ
Dany
smiled
at
him
sweetly.
вЂњit
seems
to
me
that
one-third
of
all
the
ships
in
the
world
would
be
fair.вЂќ

XaroвЂ™s
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
on
either
side
of
his
jewel-encrusted
nose.
вЂњDid
I
not
warn
you
not
to
enter
the
Palace
of
Dust?
This
is
the
very
thing
I
feared.
The
whispers
of
the
warlocks
have
made
you
as
mad
as
MallarawanвЂ™s
wife.
A
third
of
all
the
ships
in
the
world?
Pah.
Pah,
I
say.
Pah.вЂќ

Dany
had
not
seen
him
since.
His
seneschal
brought
her
messages,
each
cooler
than
the
last.
She
must
quit
his
house.
He
was
done
feeding
her
and
her
people.
He
demanded
the
return
of
his
gifts,
which
she
had
accepted
in
bad
faith.
Her
only
consolation
was
that
at
least
sheвЂ™d
had
the
great
good
sense
not
to
marry
him.

The
warlocks
whispered
of
three
treasonsвЂ¦
once
for
blood
and
once
for
gold
and
once
for
love.
The
first
traitor
was
surely
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
who
had
murdered
Khal
Drogo
and
their
unborn
son
to
avenge
her
people.
Could
Pyat
Pree
and
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
be
the
second
and
the
third?
She
did
not
think
so.
What
Pyat
did
was
not
for
gold,
and
Xaro
had
never
truly
loved
her.

The
streets
grew
emptier
as
they
passed
through
a
district
given
over
to
gloomy
stone
warehouses.
Aggo
went
before
her
and
Jhogo
behind,
leaving
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
at
her
side.
Her
bell
rang
softly,
and
Dany
found
her
thoughts
returning
to
the
Palace
of
Dust
once
more,
as
the
tongue
returns
to
a
space
left
by
a
missing
tooth.
Child
of
three,
they
had
called
her,
daughter
of
death,
slayer
of
lies,
bride
of
fire.
So
many
threes.
Three
fires,
three
mounts
to
ride,
three
treasons.
вЂњThe
dragon
has
three
heads,вЂќ
she
sighed.
вЂњDo
you
know
what
that
means,
Jorah?вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace?
The
sigil
of
House
Targaryen
is
a
three-headed
dragon,
red
on
black.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
that.
But
there
are
no
three-headed
dragons.вЂќ

вЂњThe
three
heads
were
Aegon
and
his
sisters.вЂќ

вЂњVisenya
and
Rhaenys,вЂќ
she
recalled.
вЂњI
am
descended
from
Aegon
and
Rhaenys
through
their
son
Aenys
and
their
grandson
Jaehaerys.вЂќ

вЂњBlue
lips
speak
only
lies,
isnвЂ™t
that
what
Xaro
told
you?
Why
do
you
care
what
the
warlocks
whispered?
All
they
wanted
was
to
suck
the
life
from
you,
you
know
that
now.вЂќ

вЂњPerhaps,вЂќ
she
said
reluctantly.
вЂњYet
the
things
I
sawвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњA
dead
man
in
the
prow
of
a
ship,
a
blue
rose,
a
banquet
of
bloodвЂ¦
what
does
any
of
it
mean,
Khaleesi?
A
mummerвЂ™s
dragon,
you
said.
What
is
a
mummerвЂ™s
dragon,
pray?вЂќ

вЂњA
cloth
dragon
on
poles,вЂќ
Dany
explained.
вЂњMummers
use
them
in
their
follies,
to
give
the
heroes
something
to
fight.вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
frowned.

Dany
could
not
let
it
go.
вЂњHis
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire,
my
brother
said.
IвЂ™m
certain
it
was
my
brother.
Not
Viserys,
Rhaegar.
He
had
a
harp
with
silver
strings.вЂќ

Ser
JorahвЂ™s
frown
deepened
until
his
eyebrows
came
together.
вЂњPrince
Rhaegar
played
such
a
harp,вЂќ
he
conceded.
вЂњYou
saw
him?вЂќ

She
nodded.
вЂњThere
was
a
woman
in
a
bed
with
a
babe
at
her
breast.
My
brother
said
the
babe
was
the
prince
that
was
promised
and
told
her
to
name
him
Aegon.вЂќ

вЂњPrince
Aegon
was
RhaegarвЂ™s
heir
by
Elia
of
Dorne,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said.
вЂњBut
if
he
was
this
prince
that
was
promised,
the
promise
was
broken
along
with
his
skull
when
the
Lannisters
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.вЂќ

вЂњI
remember,вЂќ
Dany
said
sadly.
вЂњThey
murdered
RhaegarвЂ™s
daughter
as
well,
the
little
princess.
Rhaenys,
she
was
named,
like
AegonвЂ™s
sister.
There
was
no
Visenya,
but
he
said
the
dragon
has
three
heads.
What
is
the
song
of
ice
and
fire?вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
no
song
IвЂ™ve
ever
heard.вЂќ

вЂњI
went
to
the
warlocks
hoping
for
answers,
but
instead
theyвЂ™ve
left
me
with
a
hundred
new
questions.вЂќ

By
then
there
were
people
in
the
streets
once
more.
вЂњMake
way,вЂќ
Aggo
shouted,
while
Jhogo
sniffed
at
the
air
suspiciously.
вЂњI
smell
it,
Khaleesi,вЂќ
he
called.
вЂњThe
poison
water.вЂќ
The
Dothraki
distrusted
the
sea
and
all
that
moved
upon
it.
Water
that
a
horse
could
not
drink
was
water
they
wanted
no
part
of.
They
will
learn,
Dany
resolved.
I
braved
their
sea
with
Khal
Drogo.
Now
they
can
brave
mine.

Qarth
was
one
of
the
worldвЂ™s
great
ports,
its
great
sheltered
harbor
a
riot
of
color
and
clangor
and
strange
smells.
Winesinks,
warehouses,
and
gaming
dens
lined
the
streets,
cheek
by
jowl
with
cheap
brothels
and
the
temples
of
peculiar
gods.
Cutpurses,
cutthroats,
spellsellers,
and
moneychangers
mingled
with
every
crowd.
The
waterfront
was
one
great
marketplace
where
the
buying
and
selling
went
on
all
day
and
all
night,
and
goods
might
be
had
for
a
fraction
of
what
they
cost
at
the
bazaar,
if
a
man
did
not
ask
where
they
came
from.
Wizened
old
women
bent
like
hunchbacks
sold
flavored
waters
and
goatвЂ™s
milk
from
glazed
ceramic
jugs
strapped
to
their
shoulders.
Seamen
from
half
a
hundred
nations
wandered
amongst
the
stalls,
drinking
spiced
liquors
and
trading
jokes
in
queer-sounding
tongues.
The
air
smelled
of
salt
and
frying
fish,
of
hot
tar
and
honey,
of
incense
and
oil
and
sperm.

Aggo
gave
an
urchin
a
copper
for
a
skewer
of
honey-roasted
mice
and
nibbled
them
as
he
rode.
Jhogo
bought
a
handful
of
fat
white
cherries.
Elsewhere
they
saw
beautiful
bronze
daggers
for
sale,
dried
squids
and
carved
onyx,
a
potent
magical
elixir
made
of
virginвЂ™s
milk
and
shade
of
the
evening,
even
dragonвЂ™s
eggs
which
looked
suspiciously
like
painted
rocks.

As
they
passed
the
long
stone
quays
reserved
for
the
ships
of
the
Thirteen,
she
saw
chests
of
saffron,
frankincense,
and
pepper
being
off-loaded
from
XaroвЂ™s
ornate
Vermillion
Kiss.
Beside
her,
casks
of
wine,
bales
of
sourleaf,
and
pallets
of
striped
hides
were
being
trundled
up
the
gangplank
onto
the
Bride
in
Azure,
to
sail
on
the
evening
tide.
Farther
along,
a
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
Spicer
galley
Sunblaze
to
bid
on
slaves.
It
was
well
known
that
the
cheapest
place
to
buy
a
slave
was
right
off
the
ship,
and
the
banners
floating
from
her
masts
proclaimed
that
the
Sunblaze
had
just
arrived
from
Astapor
on
SlaverвЂ™s
Bay.

Dany
would
get
no
help
from
the
Thirteen,
the
Tourmaline
Brotherhood,
or
the
Ancient
Guild
of
Spicers.
She
rode
her
silver
past
several
miles
of
their
quays,
docks,
and
storehouses,
all
the
way
out
to
the
far
end
of
the
horseshoe-shaped
harbor
where
the
ships
from
the
Summer
Islands,
Westeros,
and
the
Nine
Free
Cities
were
permitted
to
dock.

She
dismounted
beside
a
gaming
pit
where
a
basilisk
was
tearing
a
big
red
dog
to
pieces
amidst
a
shouting
ring
of
sailors.
вЂњAggo,
Jhogo,
you
will
guard
the
horses
while
Ser
Jorah
and
I
speak
to
the
captains.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
Khaleesi.
We
will
watch
you
as
you
go.вЂќ

It
was
good
to
hear
men
speaking
Valyrian
once
more,
and
even
the
Common
Tongue,
Dany
thought
as
they
approached
the
first
ship.
Sailors,
dockworkers,
and
merchants
alike
gave
way
before
her,
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
slim
young
girl
with
silver-gold
hair
who
dressed
in
the
Dothraki
fashion
and
walked
with
a
knight
at
her
side.
Despite
the
heat
of
the
day,
Ser
Jorah
wore
his
green
wool
surcoat
over
chainmail,
the
black
bear
of
Mormont
sewn
on
his
chest.

But
neither
her
beauty
nor
his
size
and
strength
would
serve
with
the
men
whose
ships
they
needed.

вЂњYou
require
passage
for
a
hundred
Dothraki,
all
their
horses,
yourself
and
this
knight,
and
three
dragons?вЂќ
said
the
captain
of
the
great
cog
Ardent
Friend
before
he
walked
away
laughing.
When
she
told
a
Lyseni
on
the
Trumpeteer
that
she
was
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Queen
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
he
gave
her
a
deadface
look
and
said,
вЂњAye,
and
IвЂ™m
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
and
shit
gold
every
night.вЂќ
The
cargomaster
of
the
Myrish
galley
Silken
Spirit
opined
that
dragons
were
too
dangerous
at
sea,
where
any
stray
breath
of
flame
might
set
the
rigging
afire.
The
owner
of
Lord
FaroвЂ™s
Belly
would
risk
dragons,
but
not
Dothraki.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
no
such
godless
savages
in
my
Belly,
IвЂ™ll
not.вЂќ
The
two
brothers
who
captained
the
sister
ships
Quicksilver
and
Greyhound
seemed
sympathetic
and
invited
them
into
the
cabin
for
a
glass
of
Arbor
red.
They
were
so
courteous
that
Dany
was
hopeful
for
a
time,
but
in
the
end
the
price
they
asked
was
far
beyond
her
means,
and
might
have
been
beyond
XaroвЂ™s.
Pinchbottom
Petto
and
Sloe-Eyed
Maid
were
too
small
for
her
needs,
Bravo
was
bound
for
the
Jade
Sea,
and
Magister
Manolo
scarce
looked
seaworthy.

As
they
made
their
way
toward
the
next
quay,
Ser
Jorah
laid
a
hand
against
the
small
of
her
back.
вЂњYour
Grace.
You
are
being
followed.
No,
do
not
turn.вЂќ
He
guided
her
gently
toward
a
brass-sellerвЂ™s
booth.
вЂњThis
is
a
noble
work,
my
queen,вЂќ
he
proclaimed
loudly,
lifting
a
large
platter
for
her
inspection.
вЂњSee
how
it
shines
in
the
sun?вЂќ

The
brass
was
polished
to
a
high
sheen.
Dany
could
see
her
face
in
itвЂ¦
and
when
Ser
Jorah
angled
it
to
the
right,
she
could
see
behind
her.
вЂњI
see
a
fat
brown
man
and
an
older
man
with
a
staff.
Which
is
it?вЂќ

вЂњBoth
of
them,вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
said.
вЂњThey
have
been
following
us
since
we
left
Quicksilver.вЂќ

The
ripples
in
the
brass
stretched
the
strangers
queerly,
making
one
man
seem
long
and
gaunt,
the
other
immensely
squat
and
broad.
вЂњA
most
excellent
brass,
great
lady,вЂќ
the
merchant
exclaimed.
вЂњBright
as
the
sun!
And
for
the
Mother
of
Dragons,
only
thirty
honors.вЂќ

The
platter
was
worth
no
more
than
three.
вЂњWhere
are
my
guards?вЂќ
Dany
declared.
вЂњThis
man
is
trying
to
rob
me!вЂќ
For
Jorah,
she
lowered
her
voice
and
spoke
in
the
Common
Tongue.
вЂњThey
may
not
mean
me
ill.
Men
have
looked
at
women
since
time
began,
perhaps
it
is
no
more
than
that.вЂќ

The
brass-seller
ignored
their
whispers.
вЂњThirty?
Did
I
say
thirty?
Such
a
fool
I
am.
The
price
is
twenty
honors.вЂќ

вЂњAll
the
brass
in
this
booth
is
not
worth
twenty
honors,вЂќ
Dany
told
him
as
she
studied
the
reflections.
The
old
man
had
the
look
of
Westeros
about
him,
and
the
brown-skinned
one
must
weigh
twenty
stone.
The
Usurper
offered
a
lordship
to
the
man
who
kills
me,
and
these
two
are
far
from
home.
Or
could
they
be
creatures
of
the
warlocks,
meant
to
take
me
unawares?

вЂњTen,
Khaleesi,
because
you
are
so
lovely.
Use
it
for
a
looking
glass.
Only
brass
this
fine
could
capture
such
beauty.вЂќ

вЂњIt
might
serve
to
carry
nightsoil.
If
you
threw
it
away,
I
might
pick
it
up,
so
long
as
I
did
not
need
to
stoop.
But
pay
for
it?вЂќ
Dany
shoved
the
platter
back
into
his
hands.
вЂњWorms
have
crawled
up
your
nose
and
eaten
your
wits.вЂќ

вЂњEight
honors,вЂќ
he
cried.
вЂњMy
wives
will
beat
me
and
call
me
fool,
but
I
am
a
helpless
child
in
your
hands.
Come,
eight,
that
is
less
than
it
is
worth.вЂќ

вЂњWhat
do
I
need
with
dull
brass
when
Xaro
Xhoan
Daxos
feeds
me
off
plates
of
gold?вЂќ
As
she
turned
to
walk
off,
Dany
let
her
glance
sweep
over
the
strangers.
The
brown
man
was
near
as
wide
as
heвЂ™d
looked
in
the
platter,
with
a
gleaming
bald
head
and
the
smooth
cheeks
of
a
eunuch.
A
long
curving
arakh
was
thrust
through
the
sweat-stained
yellow
silk
of
his
bellyband.
Above
the
silk,
he
was
naked
but
for
an
absurdly
tiny
iron-studded
vest.
Old
scars
crisscrossed
his
tree-trunk
arms,
huge
chest,
and
massive
belly,
pale
against
his
nut-brown
skin.

The
other
man
wore
a
travelerвЂ™s
cloak
of
undyed
wool,
the
hood
thrown
back.
Long
white
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders,
and
a
silky
white
beard
covered
the
lower
half
of
his
face.
He
leaned
his
weight
on
a
hardwood
staff
as
tall
as
he
was.
Only
fools
would
stare
so
openly
if
they
meant
me
harm.
All
the
same,
it
might
be
prudent
to
head
back
toward
Jhogo
and
Aggo.
вЂњThe
old
man
does
not
wear
a
sword,вЂќ
she
said
to
Jorah
in
the
Common
Tongue
as
she
drew
him
away.

The
brass
merchant
came
hopping
after
them.
вЂњFive
honors,
for
five
it
is
yours,
it
was
meant
for
you.вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
said,
вЂњA
hardwood
staff
can
crack
a
skull
as
well
as
any
mace.вЂќ

вЂњFour!
I
know
you
want
it!вЂќ
He
danced
in
front
of
them,
scampering
backward
as
he
thrust
the
platter
at
their
faces.

вЂњDo
they
follow?вЂќ

вЂњLift
that
up
a
little
higher,вЂќ
the
knight
told
the
merchant.
вЂњYes.
The
old
man
pretends
to
linger
at
a
potterвЂ™s
stall,
but
the
brown
one
has
eyes
only
for
you.вЂќ

вЂњTwo
honors!
Two!
Two!вЂќ
The
merchant
was
panting
heavily
from
the
effort
of
running
backward.

вЂњPay
him
before
he
kills
himself,вЂќ
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah,
wondering
what
she
was
going
to
do
with
a
huge
brass
platter.
She
turned
back
as
he
reached
for
his
coins,
intending
to
put
an
end
to
this
mummerвЂ™s
farce.
The
blood
of
the
dragon
would
not
be
herded
through
the
bazaar
by
an
old
man
and
a
fat
eunuch.

A
Qartheen
stepped
into
her
path.
вЂњMother
of
Dragons,
for
you.вЂќ
He
knelt
and
thrust
a
jewel
box
into
her
face.

Dany
took
it
almost
by
reflex.
The
box
was
carved
wood,
its
mother-of-pearl
lid
inlaid
with
jasper
and
chalcedony.
вЂњYou
are
too
generous.вЂќ
She
opened
it.
Within
was
a
glittering
green
scarab
carved
from
onyx
and
emerald.
Beautiful,
she
thought.
This
will
help
pay
for
our
passage.
As
she
reached
inside
the
box,
the
man
said,
вЂњI
am
so
sorry,вЂќ
but
she
hardly
heard.

The
scarab
unfolded
with
a
hiss.

Dany
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
malign
black
face,
almost
human,
and
an
arched
tail
dripping
venomвЂ¦
and
then
the
box
flew
from
her
hand
in
pieces,
turning
end
over
end.
Sudden
pain
twisted
her
fingers.
As
she
cried
out
and
clutched
her
hand,
the
brass
merchant
let
out
a
shriek,
a
woman
screamed,
and
suddenly
the
Qartheen
were
shouting
and
pushing
each
other
aside.
Ser
Jorah
slammed
past
her,
and
Dany
stumbled
to
one
knee.
She
heard
the
hiss
again.
The
old
man
drove
the
butt
of
his
staff
into
the
ground,
Aggo
came
riding
through
an
eggsellerвЂ™s
stall
and
vaulted
from
his
saddle,
JhogoвЂ™s
whip
cracked
overhead,
Ser
Jorah
slammed
the
eunuch
over
the
head
with
the
brass
platter,
sailors
and
whores
and
merchants
were
fleeing
or
shouting
or
bothвЂ¦

вЂњYour
Grace,
a
thousand
pardons.вЂќ
The
old
man
knelt.
вЂњItвЂ™s
dead.
Did
I
break
your
hand?вЂќ

She
closed
her
fingers,
wincing.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
think
so.вЂќ

вЂњI
had
to
knock
it
away,вЂќ
he
started,
but
her
bloodriders
were
on
him
before
he
could
finish.
Aggo
kicked
his
staff
away
and
Jhogo
seized
him
round
the
shoulders,
forced
him
to
his
knees,
and
pressed
a
dagger
to
his
throat.
вЂњKhaleesi,
we
saw
him
strike
you.
Would
you
see
the
color
of
his
blood?вЂќ

вЂњRelease
him.вЂќ
Dany
climbed
to
her
feet.
вЂњLook
at
the
bottom
of
his
staff,
blood
of
my
blood.вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
had
been
shoved
off
his
feet
by
the
eunuch.
She
ran
between
them
as
arakh
and
longsword
both
came
flashing
from
their
sheaths.
вЂњPut
down
your
steel!
Stop
it!вЂќ

вЂњYour
Grace?вЂќ
Mormont
lowered
his
sword
only
an
inch.
вЂњThese
men
attacked
you.вЂќ

вЂњThey
were
defending
me.вЂќ
Dany
snapped
her
hand
to
shake
the
sting
from
her
fingers.
вЂњIt
was
the
other
one,
the
Qartheen.вЂќ
When
she
looked
around
he
was
gone.
вЂњHe
was
a
Sorrowful
Man.
There
was
a
manticore
in
that
jewel
box
he
gave
me.
This
man
knocked
it
out
of
my
hand.вЂќ
The
brass
merchant
was
still
rolling
on
the
ground.
She
went
to
him
and
helped
him
to
his
feet.
вЂњWere
you
stung?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
good
lady,вЂќ
he
said,
shaking,
вЂњor
else
I
would
be
dead.
But
it
touched
me,
aieeee,
when
it
fell
from
the
box
it
landed
on
my
arm.вЂќ
He
had
soiled
himself,
she
saw,
and
no
wonder.

She
gave
him
a
silver
for
his
trouble
and
sent
him
on
his
way
before
she
turned
back
to
the
old
man
with
the
white
beard.
вЂњWho
is
it
that
I
owe
my
life
to?вЂќ

вЂњYou
owe
me
nothing,
Your
Grace.
I
am
called
Arstan,
though
Belwas
named
me
Whitebeard
on
the
voyage
here.вЂќ
Though
Jhogo
had
released
him
the
old
man
remained
on
one
knee.
Aggo
picked
up
his
staff,
turned
it
over,
cursed
softly
in
Dothraki,
scraped
the
remains
of
the
manticore
off
on
a
stone,
and
handed
it
back.

вЂњAnd
who
is
Belwas?вЂќ
she
asked.

The
huge
brown
eunuch
swaggered
forward,
sheathing
his
arakh.
вЂњI
am
Belwas.
Strong
Belwas
they
name
me
in
the
fighting
pits
of
Meereen.
Never
did
I
lose.вЂќ
He
slapped
his
belly,
covered
with
scars.
вЂњI
let
each
man
cut
me
once,
before
I
kill
him.
Count
the
cuts
and
you
will
know
how
many
Strong
Belwas
has
slain.вЂќ

Dany
had
no
need
to
count
his
scars;
there
were
many,
she
could
see
at
a
glance.
вЂњAnd
why
are
you
here,
Strong
Belwas?вЂќ

вЂњFrom
Meereen
I
am
sold
to
Qohor,
and
then
to
Pentos
and
the
fat
man
with
sweet
stink
in
his
hair.
He
it
was
who
send
Strong
Belwas
back
across
the
sea,
and
old
Whitebeard
to
serve
him.вЂќ

The
fat
man
with
sweet
stink
in
his
hairвЂ¦вЂњIllyrio?вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњYou
were
sent
by
Magister
Illyrio?вЂќ

вЂњWe
were,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
old
Whitebeard
replied.
вЂњThe
Magister
begs
your
kind
indulgence
for
sending
us
in
his
stead,
but
he
cannot
sit
a
horse
as
he
did
in
his
youth,
and
sea
travel
upsets
his
digestion.вЂќ
Earlier
he
had
spoken
in
the
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
but
now
he
changed
to
the
Common
Tongue.
вЂњI
regret
if
we
caused
you
alarm.
If
truth
be
told,
we
were
not
certain,
we
expected
someone
moreвЂ¦
moreвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњRegal?вЂќ
Dany
laughed.
She
had
no
dragon
with
her,
and
her
raiment
was
hardly
queenly.
вЂњYou
speak
the
Common
Tongue
well,
Arstan.
Are
you
of
Westeros?вЂќ

вЂњI
am.
I
was
born
on
the
Dornish
Marches,
Your
Grace.
As
a
boy
I
squired
for
a
knight
of
Lord
SwannвЂ™s
household.вЂќ
He
held
the
tall
staff
upright
beside
him
like
a
lance
in
need
of
a
banner.
вЂњNow
I
squire
for
Belwas.вЂќ

вЂњA
bit
old
for
such,
arenвЂ™t
you?вЂќ
Ser
Jorah
had
shouldered
his
way
to
her
side,
holding
the
brass
platter
awkwardly
under
his
arm.
BelwasвЂ™s
hard
head
had
left
it
badly
bent.

вЂњNot
too
old
to
serve
my
liege,
Lord
Mormont.вЂќ

вЂњYou
know
me
as
well?вЂќ

вЂњI
saw
you
fight
a
time
or
two.
At
Lannisport
where
you
near
unhorsed
the
Kingslayer.
And
on
Pyke,
there
as
well.
You
do
not
recall,
Lord
Mormont?вЂќ

Ser
Jorah
frowned.
вЂњYour
face
seems
familiar,
but
there
were
hundreds
at
Lannisport
and
thousands
on
Pyke.
And
I
am
no
lord.
Bear
Island
was
taken
from
me.
I
am
but
a
knight.вЂќ

вЂњA
knight
of
my
Queensguard.вЂќ
Dany
took
his
arm.
вЂњAnd
my
true
friend
and
good
counselor.вЂќ
She
studied
ArstanвЂ™s
face.
He
had
a
great
dignity
to
him,
a
quiet
strength
she
liked.
вЂњRise,
Arstan
Whitebeard.
Be
welcome,
Strong
Belwas.
Ser
Jorah
you
know.
Ko
Aggo
and
Ko
Jhogo
are
blood
of
my
blood.
They
crossed
the
red
waste
with
me,
and
saw
my
dragons
born.вЂќ

вЂњHorse
boys.вЂќ
Belwas
grinned
toothily.
вЂњBelwas
has
killed
many
horse
boys
in
the
fighting
pits.
They
jingle
when
they
die.вЂќ

AggoвЂ™s
arakh
leapt
to
his
hand.
вЂњNever
have
I
killed
a
fat
brown
man.
Belwas
will
be
the
first.вЂќ

вЂњSheath
your
steel,
blood
of
my
blood,вЂќ
said
Dany,
вЂњthis
man
comes
to
serve
me.
Belwas,
you
will
accord
all
respect
to
my
people,
or
you
will
leave
my
service
sooner
than
youвЂ™d
wish,
and
with
more
scars
than
when
you
came.вЂќ

The
gap-toothed
smile
faded
from
the
giantвЂ™s
broad
brown
face,
replaced
by
a
confused
scowl.
Men
did
not
often
threaten
Belwas,
it
would
seem,
and
less
so
girls
a
third
his
size.

Dany
gave
him
a
smile,
to
take
a
bit
of
the
sting
from
the
rebuke.
вЂњNow
tell
me,
what
would
Magister
Illyrio
have
of
me,
that
he
would
send
you
all
the
way
from
Pentos?вЂќ

вЂњHe
would
have
dragons,вЂќ
said
Belwas
gruffly,
вЂњand
the
girl
who
makes
them.
He
would
have
you.вЂќ

вЂњBelwas
has
the
truth
of
us,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
said
Arstan.
вЂњWe
were
told
to
find
you
and
bring
you
back
to
Pentos.
The
Seven
Kingdoms
have
need
of
you.
Robert
the
Usurper
is
dead,
and
the
realm
bleeds.
When
we
set
sail
from
Pentos
there
were
four
kings
in
the
land,
and
no
justice
to
be
had.вЂќ

Joy
bloomed
in
her
heart,
but
Dany
kept
it
from
her
face.
вЂњI
have
three
dragons,вЂќ
she
said,
вЂњand
more
than
a
hundred
in
my
khalasar,
with
all
their
goods
and
horses.вЂќ

вЂњit
is
no
matter,вЂќ
boomed
Belwas.
вЂњWe
take
all.
The
fat
man
hires
three
ships
for
his
little
silverhair
queen.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
so,
Your
Grace,вЂќ
Arstan
Whitebeard
said.
вЂњThe
great
cog
Saduleon
is
berthed
at
the
end
of
the
quay,
and
the
galleys
Summer
Sun
and
JosoвЂ™s
Prank
are
anchored
beyond
the
breakwater.вЂќ

Three
heads
has
the
dragon,
Dany
thought,
wondering.
вЂњI
shall
tell
my
people
to
make
ready
to
depart
at
once.
But
the
ships
that
bring
me
home
must
bear
different
names.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
wish,вЂќ
said
Arstan.
вЂњWhat
names
would
you
prefer?вЂќ

вЂњVhagar,вЂќ
Daenerys
told
him.
вЂњMeraxes.
And
Balerion.
Paint
the
names
on
their
hulls
in
golden
letters
three
feet
high,
Arstan.
I
want
every
man
who
sees
them
to
know
the
dragons
are
returned.вЂќ





ARYA

The
heads
had
been
dipped
in
tar
to
slow
the
rot.
Every
morning
when
Arya
went
to
the
well
to
draw
fresh
water
for
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
basin,
she
had
to
pass
beneath
them.
They
faced
outward,
so
she
never
saw
their
faces,
but
she
liked
to
pretend
that
one
of
them
was
JoffreyвЂ™s.
She
tried
to
picture
how
his
pretty
face
would
look
dipped
in
tar.
If
I
was
a
crow
I
could
fly
down
and
peck
off
his
stupid
fat
pouty
lips.

The
heads
never
lacked
for
attendants.
The
carrion
crows
wheeled
about
the
gatehouse
in
raucous
unkindness
and
quarreled
upon
the
ramparts
over
every
eye,
screaming
and
cawing
at
each
other
and
taking
to
the
air
whenever
a
sentry
passed
along
the
battlements.
Sometimes
the
maesterвЂ™s
ravens
joined
the
feast
as
well,
flapping
down
from
the
rookery
on
wide
black
wings.
When
the
ravens
came
the
crows
would
scatter,
only
to
return
the
moment
the
larger
birds
were
gone.

Do
the
ravens
remember
Maester
Tothmure?
Arya
wondered.
Are
they
sad
for
him?
When
they
quork
at
him,
do
they
wonder
why
he
doesnвЂ™t
answer?
Perhaps
the
dead
could
speak
to
them
in
some
secret
tongue
the
living
could
not
hear.

Tothmure
had
been
sent
to
the
axe
for
dispatching
birds
to
Casterly
Rock
and
KingвЂ™s
Landing
the
night
Harrenhal
had
fallen,
Lucan
the
armorer
for
making
weapons
for
the
Lannisters,
Goodwife
Harra
for
telling
Lady
WhentвЂ™s
household
to
serve
them,
the
steward
for
giving
Lord
Tywin
the
keys
to
the
treasure
vault.
The
cook
was
spared
(some
said
because
heвЂ™d
made
the
weasel
soup),
but
stocks
were
hammered
together
for
pretty
Pia
and
the
other
women
whoвЂ™d
shared
their
favors
with
Lannister
soldiers.
Stripped
and
shaved,
they
were
left
in
the
middle
ward
beside
the
bear
pit,
free
for
the
use
of
any
man
who
wanted
them.

Three
Frey
men-at-arms
were
using
them
that
morning
as
Arya
went
to
the
well.
She
tried
not
to
look,
but
she
could
hear
the
men
laughing.
The
pail
was
very
heavy
once
full.
She
was
turning
to
bring
it
back
to
Kingspyre
when
Goodwife
Amabel
seized
her
arm.
The
water
went
sloshing
over
the
side
onto
AmabelвЂ™s
legs.
вЂњYou
did
that
on
purpose,вЂќ
the
woman
screeched.

вЂњWhat
do
you
want?вЂќ
Arya
squirmed
in
her
grasp.
Amabel
had
been
half-crazed
since
theyвЂ™d
cut
HarraвЂ™s
head
off.

вЂњSee
there?вЂќ
Arnabel
pointed
across
the
yard
at
Pia.
вЂњWhen
this
northman
falls
youвЂ™ll
be
where
she
is.вЂќ

вЂњLet
me
go.вЂќ
She
tried
to
wrench
free,
but
Amabel
only
tightened
her
fingers.

вЂњHe
will
fall
too,
Harrenhal
pulls
them
all
down
in
the
end.
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
won
now,
heвЂ™ll
be
marching
back
with
all
his
power,
and
then
it
will
be
his
turn
to
punish
the
disloyal.
And
donвЂ™t
think
he
wonвЂ™t
know
what
you
did!вЂќ
The
old
woman
laughed.
вЂњI
may
have
a
turn
at
you
myself.
Harra
had
an
old
broom,
IвЂ™ll
save
it
for
you.
The
handleвЂ™s
cracked
and
splinteryвЂ”вЂќ

Arya
swung
the
bucket.
The
weight
of
the
water
made
it
turn
in
her
hands,
so
she
didnвЂ™t
smash
AmabelвЂ™s
head
in
as
she
wanted,
but
the
woman
let
go
of
her
anyway
when
the
water
came
out
and
drenched
her.
вЂњDonвЂ™t
ever
touch
me,вЂќ
Arya
shouted,
вЂњor
IвЂ™ll
kill
you.
You
get
away.вЂќ

Sopping,
Goodwife
Amabel
jabbed
a
thin
finger
at
the
flayed
man
on
the
front
of
AryaвЂ™s
tunic.
вЂњYou
think
youвЂ™re
safe
with
that
little
bloody
man
on
your
teat,
but
youвЂ™re
not!
The
Lannisters
are
coming!
See
what
happens
when
they
get
here.вЂќ

Three-quarters
of
the
water
had
splashed
out
on
the
ground,
so
Arya
had
to
return
to
the
well.
If
I
told
Lord
Bolton
what
she
said,
her
head
would
be
up
next
to
HarraвЂ™s
before
it
got
dark,
she
thought
as
she
drew
up
the
bucket
again.
She
wouldnвЂ™t,
though.

Once,
when
there
had
been
only
half
as
many
heads,
Gendry
had
caught
Arya
looking
at
them.
вЂњAdmiring
your
work?вЂќ
he
asked.

He
was
angry
because
heвЂ™d
liked
Lucan,
she
knew,
but
it
still
wasnвЂ™t
fair.
вЂњItвЂ™s
Steelshanks
WaltonвЂ™s
work,вЂќ
she
said
defensively.
вЂњAnd
the
Mummers,
and
Lord
Bolton.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
who
gave
us
all
them?
You
and
your
weasel
soup.вЂќ

Arya
punched
his
arm.
вЂњIt
was
just
hot
broth.
You
hated
Ser
Amory
too.вЂќ

вЂњI
hate
this
lot
worse.
Ser
Amory
was
fighting
for
his
lord,
but
the
Mummers
are
sellswords
and
turncloaks.
Half
of
them
canвЂ™t
even
speak
the
Common
Tongue.
Septon
Utt
likes
little
boys,
Qyburn
does
black
magic,
and
your
friend
Biter
eats
people.вЂќ

The
worst
thing
was,
she
couldnвЂ™t
even
say
he
was
wrong.
The
Brave
Companions
did
most
of
the
foraging
for
Harrenhal,
and
Roose
Bolton
had
given
them
the
task
of
rooting
out
Lannisters.
Vargo
Hoat
had
divided
them
into
four
bands,
to
visit
as
many
villages
as
possible.
He
led
the
largest
group
himself,
and
gave
the
others
to
his
most
trusted
captains.
She
had
heard
Rorge
laughing
over
Lord
VargoвЂ™s
way
of
finding
traitors.
All
he
did
was
return
to
places
he
had
visited
before
under
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
banner
and
seize
those
who
had
helped
him.
Many
had
been
bought
with
Lannister
silver,
so
the
Mummers
often
returned
with
bags
of
coin
as
well
as
baskets
of
heads.
вЂњA
riddle!вЂќ
Shagwell
would
shout
gleefully.
вЂњIf
Lord
BoltonвЂ™s
goat
eats
the
men
who
fed
Lord
LannisterвЂ™s
goat,
how
many
goats
are
there?вЂќ

вЂњOne,вЂќ
Arya
said
when
he
asked
her.

вЂњNow
thereвЂ™s
a
weasel
clever
as
a
goat!вЂќ
the
fool
tittered.

Rorge
and
Biter
were
as
bad
as
the
others.
Whenever
Lord
Bolton
took
a
meal
with
the
garrison,
Arya
would
see
them
there
among
the
rest.
Biter
gave
off
a
stench
like
bad
cheese,
so
the
Brave
Companions
made
him
sit
down
near
the
foot
of
the
table
where
he
could
grunt
and
hiss
to
himself
and
tear
his
meat
apart
with
fingers
and
teeth.
He
would
sniff
at
Arya
when
she
passed,
but
it
was
Rorge
who
scared
her
most.
He
sat
up
near
Faithful
Ursywck,
but
she
could
feel
his
eyes
crawling
over
her
as
she
went
about
her
duties.

Sometimes
she
wished
she
had
gone
off
across
the
narrow
sea
with
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar.
She
still
had
the
stupid
coin
heвЂ™d
given
her,
a
piece
of
iron
no
larger
than
a
penny
and
rusted
along
the
rim.
One
side
had
writing
on
it,
queer
words
she
could
not
read.
The
other
showed
a
manвЂ™s
head,
but
so
worn
that
all
his
features
had
rubbed
off.
He
said
it
was
of
great
value,
but
that
was
probably
a
lie
too,
like
his
name
and
even
his
face.
That
made
her
so
angry
that
she
threw
the
coin
away,
but
after
an
hour
she
got
to
feeling
bad
and
went
and
found
it
again,
even
though
it
wasnвЂ™t
worth
anything.

She
was
thinking
about
the
coin
as
she
crossed
the
Flowstone
Yard,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
the
water
in
her
pail.
вЂњNan,вЂќ
a
voice
called
out.
вЂњPut
down
that
pail
and
come
help
me.вЂќ

Elmar
Frey
was
no
older
than
she
was,
and
short
for
his
age
besides.
He
had
been
rolling
a
barrel
of
sand
across
the
uneven
stone,
and
was
red-faced
from
exertion.
Arya
went
to
help
him.
Together
they
pushed
the
barrel
all
the
way
to
the
wall
and
back
again,
then
stood
it
upright.

She
could
hear
the
sand
shifting
around
inside
as
Elmar
pried
open
the
lid
and
pulled
out
a
chainmail
hauberk.
вЂњDo
you
think
itвЂ™s
clean
enough?вЂќ
As
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
squire,
it
was
his
task
to
keep
his
mail
shiny
bright.

вЂњYou
need
to
shake
out
the
sand.
ThereвЂ™s
still
spots
of
rust.
See?вЂќ
She
pointed.
вЂњYouвЂ™d
best
do
it
again.вЂќ

вЂњYou
do
it.вЂќ
Elmar
could
be
friendly
when
he
needed
help,
but
afterward
he
would
always
remember
that
he
was
a
squire
and
she
was
only
a
serving
girl,
He
liked
to
boast
how
he
was
the
son
of
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing,
not
a
nephew
or
a
bastard
or
a
grandson
but
a
trueborn
son,
and
on
account
of
that
he
was
going
to
marry
a
princess.

Arya
didnвЂ™t
care
about
his
precious
princess,
and
didnвЂ™t
like
him
giving
her
commands.
вЂњI
have
to
bring
mвЂ™lord
water
for
his
basin.
HeвЂ™s
in
his
bedchamber
being
leeched.
Not
the
regular
black
leeches
but
the
big
pale
ones.вЂќ

ElmarвЂ™s
eyes
got
as
big
as
boiled
eggs.
Leeches
terrified
him,
especially
the
big
pale
ones
that
looked
like
jelly
until
they
filled
up
with
blood.
вЂњI
forgot,
youвЂ™re
too
skinny
to
push
such
a
heavy
barrel.вЂќ

вЂњI
forgot,
youвЂ™re
stupid.вЂќ
Arya
picked
up
the
pail.
вЂњMaybe
you
should
get
leeched
too.
ThereвЂ™s
leeches
in
the
Neck
as
big
as
pigs.вЂќ
She
left
him
there
with
his
barrel.

The
lordвЂ™s
bedchamber
was
crowded
when
she
entered.
Qyburn
was
in
attendance,
and
dour
Walton
in
his
mail
shirt
and
greaves,
plus
a
dozen
Freys,
all
brothers,
half
brothers,
and
cousins.
Roose
Bolton
lay
abed,
naked.
Leeches
clung
to
the
inside
of
his
arms
and
legs
and
dotted
his
pallid
chest,
long
translucent
things
that
turned
a
glistening
pink
as
they
fed.
Bolton
paid
them
no
more
mind
than
he
did
Arya.

вЂњWe
must
not
allow
Lord
Tywin
to
trap
us
here
at
Harrenhal,вЂќ
Ser
Aenys
Frey
was
saying
as
Arya
filled
the
washbasin.
A
grey
stooped
giant
of
a
man
with
watery
red
eyes
and
huge
gnarled
hands,
Ser
Aenys
had
brought
fifteen
hundred
Frey
swords
south
to
Harrenhal,
yet
it
often
seemed
as
if
he
were
helpless
to
command
even
his
own
brothers.
вЂњThe
castle
is
so
large
it
requires
an
army
to
hold
it,
and
once
surrounded
we
cannot
feed
an
army.
Nor
can
we
hope
to
lay
in
sufficient
supplies.
The
country
is
ash,
the
villages
given
over
to
wolves,
the
harvest
burnt
or
stolen.
Autumn
is
on
us,
yet
there
is
no
food
in
store
and
none
being
planted.
We
live
on
forage,
and
if
the
Lannisters
deny
that
to
us,
we
will
be
down
to
rats
and
shoe
leather
in
a
moonвЂ™s
turn.вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
mean
to
be
besieged
here.вЂќ
Roose
BoltonвЂ™s
voice
was
so
soft
that
men
had
to
strain
to
hear
it,
so
his
chambers
were
always
strangely
hushed.

вЂњWhat,
then?вЂќ
demanded
Ser
Jared
Frey,
who
was
lean,
balding,
and
pockmarked.
вЂњIs
Edmure
Tully
so
drunk
on
his
victory
that
he
thinks
to
give
Lord
Tywin
battle
in
the
open
field?вЂќ

If
he
does
heвЂ™ll
beat
them,
Arya
thought.
HeвЂ™ll
beat
them
as
he
did
on
the
Red
Fork,
youвЂ™ll
see.
Unnoticed,
she
went
to
stand
by
Qyburn.

вЂњLord
Tywin
is
many
leagues
from
here,вЂќ
Bolton
said
calmly.
вЂњHe
has
many
matters
yet
to
settle
at
KingвЂ™s
Landing.
He
will
not
march
on
Harrenhal
for
some
time.вЂќ

Ser
Aenys
shook
his
head
stubbornly.
вЂњYou
do
not
know
the
Lannisters
as
we
do,
my
lord.
King
Stannis
thought
that
Lord
Tywin
was
a
thousand
leagues
away
as
well,
and
it
undid
him.вЂќ

The
pale
man
in
the
bed
smiled
faintly
as
the
leeches
nursed
of
his
blood.
вЂњI
am
not
a
man
to
be
undone,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњEven
if
Riverrun
marshals
all
its
strength
and
the
Young
Wolf
wins
back
from
the
west,
how
can
we
hope
to
match
the
numbers
Lord
Tywin
can
send
against
us?
When
he
comes,
he
will
come
with
far
more
power
than
he
commanded
on
the
Green
Fork.
Highgarden
has
joined
itself
to
JoffreyвЂ™s
cause,
I
remind
you!вЂќ

вЂњI
had
not
forgotten.вЂќ

вЂњI
have
been
Lord
TywinвЂ™s
captive
once,вЂќ
said
Ser
Hosteen,
a
husky
man
with
a
square
face
who
was
said
to
be
the
strongest
of
the
Freys.
вЂњI
have
no
wish
to
enjoy
Lannister
hospitality
again.вЂќ

Ser
Harys
Haigh,
who
was
a
Frey
on
his
motherвЂ™s
side,
nodded
vigorously.
вЂњIf
Lord
Tywin
could
defeat
a
seasoned
man
like
Stannis
Baratheon,
what
chance
will
our
boy
king
have
against
him?вЂќ
He
looked
round
to
his
brothers
and
cousins
for
support,
and
several
of
them
muttered
agreement.

вЂњSomeone
must
have
the
courage
to
say
it,вЂќ
Ser
Hosteen
said.
вЂњThe
war
is
lost.
King
Robb
must
be
made
to
see
that.вЂќ

Roose
Bolton
studied
him
with
pale
eyes.
вЂњHis
Grace
has
defeated
the
Lannisters
every
time
he
has
faced
them
in
battle.вЂќ

вЂњHe
has
lost
the
north,вЂќ
insisted
Hosteen
Frey.
вЂњHe
has
lost
Winterfell!
His
brothers
are
deadвЂ¦вЂќ

For
a
moment
Arya
forgot
to
breathe.
Dead?
Bran
and
Rickon,
dead?
What
does
he
mean?
What
does
he
mean
about
Winterfell,
Joffrey
could
never
take
Winterfell,
never,
Robb
would
never
let
him.
Then
she
remembered
that
Robb
was
not
at
Winterfell.
He
was
away
in
the
west,
and
Bran
was
crippled,
and
Rickon
only
four.
It
took
all
her
strength
to
remain
still
and
silent,
the
way
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her,
to
stand
there
like
a
stick
of
furniture.
She
felt
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes,
and
willed
them
away.
ItвЂ™s
not
true,
it
canвЂ™t
be
true,
itвЂ™s
just
some
Lannister
lie.

вЂњHad
Stannis
won,
all
might
have
been
different,вЂќ
Ronel
Rivers
said
wistfully.
He
was
one
of
Lord
WalderвЂ™s
bastards.

вЂњStannis
lost,вЂќ
Ser
Hosteen
said
bluntly.
вЂњWishing
it
were
otherwise
will
not
make
it
so.
King
Robb
must
make
his
peace
with
the
Lannisters.
He
must
put
off
his
crown
and
bend
the
knee,
little
as
he
may
like
it.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
who
will
tell
him
so?вЂќ
Roose
Bolton
smiled.
вЂњIt
is
a
fine
thing
to
have
so
many
valiant
brothers
in
such
troubled
times.
I
shall
think
on
all
youвЂ™ve
said.вЂќ

His
smile
was
dismissal.
The
Freys
made
their
courtesies
and
shuffled
out,
leaving
only
Qyburn,
Steelshanks
Walton,
and
Arya.
Lord
Bolton
beckoned
her
closer.
вЂњI
am
bled
sufficiently.
Nan,
you
may
remove
the
leeches.вЂќ

вЂњAt
once,
my
lord.вЂќ
It
was
best
never
to
make
Roose
Bolton
ask
twice.
Arya
wanted
to
ask
him
what
Ser
Hosteen
had
meant
about
Winterfell,
but
she
dared
not.
IвЂ™ll
ask
Elmar,
she
thought.
Elmar
will
tell
me.
The
leeches
wriggled
slowly
between
her
fingers
as
she
plucked
them
carefully
from
the
lordвЂ™s
body,
their
pale
bodies
moist
to
the
touch
and
distended
with
blood.
TheyвЂ™re
only
leeches,
she
reminded
herself.
If
I
closed
my
hand,
theyвЂ™d
squish
between
my
fingers.

вЂњThere
is
a
letter
from
your
lady
wife.вЂќ
Qyburn
pulled
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
sleeve.
Though
he
wore
maesterвЂ™s
robes,
there
was
no
chain
about
his
neck;
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
lost
it
for
dabbling
in
necromancy.

вЂњYou
may
read
it,вЂќ
Bolton
said.

The
Lady
Walda
wrote
from
the
Twins
almost
every
day,
but
all
the
letters
were
the
same.
вЂњI
pray
for
you
morn,
noon,
and
night,
my
sweet
lord,вЂќ
she
wrote,
вЂњand
count
the
days
until
you
share
my
bed
again.
Return
to
me
soon,
and
I
will
give
you
many
trueborn
sons
to
take
the
place
of
your
dear
Domeric
and
rule
the
Dreadfort
after
you.вЂќ
Arya
pictured
a
plump
pink
baby
in
a
cradle,
covered
with
plump
pink
leeches.

She
brought
Lord
Bolton
a
damp
washcloth
to
wipe
down
his
soft
hairless
body.
вЂњI
will
send
a
letter
of
my
own,вЂќ
he
told
the
onetime
maester.

вЂњTo
the
Lady
Walda?вЂќ

вЂњTo
Ser
Helman
Tallhart.вЂќ

A
rider
from
Ser
Helman
had
come
two
days
past.
Tallhart
men
had
taken
the
castle
of
the
Darrys,
accepting
the
surrender
of
its
Lannister
garrison
after
a
brief
siege.

вЂњTell
him
to
put
the
captives
to
the
sword
and
the
castle
to
the
torch,
by
command
of
the
king.
Then
he
is
to
join
forces
with
Robett
Glover
and
strike
east
toward
Duskendale.
Those
are
rich
lands,
and
hardly
touched
by
the
fighting.
It
is
time
they
had
a
taste.
Glover
has
lost
a
castle,
and
Tallhart
a
son.
Let
them
take
their
vengeance
on
Duskendale.вЂќ

вЂњI
shall
prepare
the
message
for
your
seal,
my
lord.вЂќ

Arya
was
glad
to
hear
that
the
castle
of
the
Darrys
would
be
burned.
That
was
where
theyвЂ™d
brought
her
when
sheвЂ™d
been
caught
after
her
fight
with
Joffrey,
and
where
the
queen
had
made
her
father
kill
SansaвЂ™s
wolf.
It
deserves
to
burn.
She
wished
that
Robett
Glover
and
Ser
Helman
Tallhart
would
come
back
to
Harrenhal,
though;
they
had
marched
too
quickly,
before
sheвЂ™d
been
able
to
decide
whether
to
trust
them
with
her
secret.

вЂњI
will
hunt
today,вЂќ
Roose
Bolton
announced
as
Qyburn
helped
him
into
a
quilted
jerkin.

вЂњIs
it
safe,
my
lord?вЂќ
Qyburn
asked.
вЂњOnly
three
days
past,
Septon
UttвЂ™s
men
were
attacked
by
wolves.
They
came
right
into
his
camp,
not
five
yards
from
the
fire,
and
killed
two
horses.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
wolves
I
mean
to
hunt.
I
can
scarcely
sleep
at
night
for
the
howling.вЂќ
Bolton
buckled
on
his
belt,
adjusting
the
hang
of
sword
and
dagger.
вЂњItвЂ™s
said
that
direwolves
once
roamed
the
north
in
great
packs
of
a
hundred
or
more,
and
feared
neither
man
nor
mammoth,
but
that
was
long
ago
and
in
another
land.
It
is
queer
to
see
the
common
wolves
of
the
south
so
bold.вЂќ

вЂњTerrible
times
breed
terrible
things,
my
lord.вЂќ

Bolton
showed
his
teeth
in
something
that
might
have
been
a
smile.
вЂњAre
these
times
so
terrible,
Maester?вЂќ

вЂњSummer
is
gone
and
there
are
four
kings
in
the
realm.вЂќ

вЂњOne
king
may
be
terrible,
but
four?вЂќ
He
shrugged.
вЂњNan,
my
fur
cloak.вЂќ
She
brought
it
to
him.
вЂњMy
chambers
will
be
clean
and
orderly
upon
my
return,вЂќ
he
told
her
as
she
fastened
it.
вЂњAnd
tend
to
Lady
WaldaвЂ™s
letter.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,
my
lord.вЂќ

The
lord
and
maester
swept
from
the
room,
giving
her
not
so
much
as
a
backward
glance.
When
they
were
gone,
Arya
took
the
letter
and
carried
it
to
the
hearth,
stirring
the
logs
with
a
poker
to
wake
the
flames
anew.
She
watched
the
parchment
twist,
blacken,
and
flare
up.
If
the
Lannisters
hurt
Bran
and
Rickon,
Robb
will
kill
them
every
one.
HeвЂ™ll
never
bend
the
knee,
never,
never,
never.
HeвЂ™s
not
afraid
of
any
of
them.
Curls
of
ash
floated
up
the
chimney.
Arya
squatted
beside
the
fire,
watching
them
rise
through
a
veil
of
hot
tears.
If
Winterfell
is
truly
gone,
is
this
my
home
now?
Am
I
still
Arya,
or
only
Nan
the
serving
girl,
for
forever
and
forever
and
forever?

She
spent
the
next
few
hours
tending
to
the
lordвЂ™s
chambers.
She
swept
out
the
old
rushes
and
scattered
fresh
sweet-smelling
ones,
laid
a
fresh
fire
in
the
hearth,
changed
the
linens
and
fluffed
the
featherbed,
emptied
the
chamber
pots
down
the
privy
shaft
and
scrubbed
them
out,
carried
an
armload
of
soiled
clothing
to
the
washerwomen,
and
brought
up
a
bowl
of
crisp
autumn
pears
from
the
kitchen.
When
she
was
done
with
the
bedchamber,
she
went
down
half
a
flight
of
stairs
to
do
the
same
in
the
great
solar,
a
spare
drafty
room
as
large
as
the
halls
of
many
a
smaller
castle.
The
candles
were
down
to
stubs,
so
Arya
changed
them
out.
Under
the
windows
was
a
huge
oaken
table
where
the
lord
wrote
his
letters.
She
stacked
the
books,
changed
the
candles,
put
the
quills
and
inks
and
sealing
wax
in
order.

A
large
ragged
sheepskin
was
tossed
across
the
papers.
Arya
had
started
to
roll
it
up
when
the
colors
caught
her
eye:
the
blue
of
lakes
and
rivers,
the
red
dots
where
castles
and
cities
could
be
found,
the
green
of
woods.
She
spread
it
out
instead.
THE
LANDS
OF
THE
TRIDENT,
said
the
ornate
script
beneath
the
map.
The
drawing
showed
everything
from
the
Neck
to
the
Blackwater
Rush.
ThereвЂ™s
Harrenhal
at
the
top
of
the
big
lake,
she
realized,
but
whereвЂ™s
Riverrun?
Then
she
saw.
ItвЂ™s
not
so
farвЂ¦

The
afternoon
was
still
young
by
the
time
she
was
done,
so
Arya
took
herself
off
to
the
godswood.
Her
duties
were
lighter
as
Lord
BoltonвЂ™s
cupbearer
than
they
had
been
under
Weese
or
even
Pinkeye,
though
they
required
dressing
like
a
page
and
washing
more
than
she
liked.
The
hunt
would
not
return
for
hours,
so
she
had
a
little
time
for
her
needlework.

She
slashed
at
birch
leaves
till
the
splintery
point
of
the
broken
broomstick
was
green
and
sticky.
вЂњSer
Gregor,вЂќ
she
breathed.
вЂњDunsen,
Polliver,
Raff
the
Sweetling.вЂќ
She
spun
and
leapt
and
balanced
on
the
balls
of
her
feet,
darting
this
way
and
that,
knocking
pinecones
flying.
вЂњThe
Tickler,вЂќ
she
called
out
one
time,
вЂњthe
Hound,вЂќ
the
next.
вЂњSer
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.вЂќ
The
bole
of
an
oak
loomed
before
her,
and
she
lunged
to
drive
her
point
through
it,
grunting
вЂњJoffrey,
Joffrey,
Joffrey.вЂќ
Her
arms
and
legs
were
dappled
by
sunlight
and
the
shadows
of
leaves.
A
sheen
of
sweat
covered
her
skin
by
the
time
she
paused.
The
heel
of
her
right
foot
was
bloody
where
sheвЂ™d
skinned
it,
so
she
stood
one-legged
before
the
heart
tree
and
raised
her
sword
in
salute.
вЂњValar
morghulis,вЂќ
she
told
the
old
gods
of
the
north.
She
liked
how
the
words
sounded
when
she
said
them.

As
Arya
crossed
the
yard
to
the
bathhouse,
she
spied
a
raven
circling
down
toward
the
rookery,
and
wondered
where
it
had
come
from
and
what
message
it
carried.
Might
be
itвЂ™s
from
Robb,
come
to
say
it
wasnвЂ™t
true
about
Bran
and
Rickon.
She
chewed
on
her
lip,
hoping.
If
I
had
wings
I
could
fly
back
to
Winterfell
and
see
for
myself.
And
if
it
was
true,
IвЂ™d
just
fly
away,
fly
up
past
the
moon
and
the
shining
stars,
and
see
all
the
things
in
Old
NanвЂ™s
stories,
dragons
and
sea
monsters
and
the
Titan
of
Braavos,
and
maybe
I
wouldnвЂ™t
ever
fly
back
unless
I
wanted
to.

The
hunting
party
returned
near
evenfall
with
nine
dead
wolves.
Seven
were
adults,
big
grey-brown
beasts,
savage
and
powerful,
their
mouths
drawn
back
over
long
yellow
teeth
by
their
dying
snarls.
But
the
other
two
had
only
been
pups.
Lord
Bolton
gave
orders
for
the
skins
to
be
sewn
into
a
blanket
for
his
bed.
вЂњCubs
still
have
that
soft
fur,
my
lord,вЂќ
one
of
his
men
pointed
out.
вЂњMake
you
a
nice
warm
pair
of
gloves.вЂќ

Bolton
glanced
up
at
the
banners
waving
above
the
gatehouse
towers.
вЂњAs
the
Starks
are
wont
to
remind
us,
winter
is
coming.
Have
it
done.вЂќ
When
he
saw
Arya
looking
on,
he
said,
вЂњNan,
IвЂ™ll
want
a
flagon
of
hot
spice
wine,
I
took
a
chill
in
the
woods.
See
that
it
doesnвЂ™t
get
cold.
IвЂ™m
of
a
mind
to
sup
alone.
Barley
bread,
butter,
and
boar.вЂќ

вЂњAt
once,
my
lord.вЂќ
That
was
always
the
best
thing
to
say.

Hot
Pie
was
making
oatcakes
when
she
entered
the
kitchen.
Three
other
cooks
were
boning
fish,
while
a
spit
boy
turned
a
boar
over
the
flames.
вЂњMy
lord
wants
his
supper,
and
hot
spice
wine
to
wash
it
down,вЂќ
Arya
announced,
вЂњand
he
doesnвЂ™t
want
it
cold.вЂќ
One
of
the
cooks
washed
his
hands,
took
out
a
kettle,
and
filled
it
with
a
heavy,
sweet
red.
Hot
Pie
was
told
to
crumble
in
the
spices
as
the
wine
heated.
Arya
went
to
help.

вЂњI
can
do
it,вЂќ
he
said
sullenly.
вЂњI
donвЂ™t
need
you
to
show
me
how
to
spice
wine.вЂќ

He
hates
me
too,
or
else
heвЂ™s
scared
of
me.
She
backed
away,
more
sad
than
angry.
When
the
food
was
ready,
the
cooks
covered
it
with
a
silver
cover
and
wrapped
the
flagon
in
a
thick
towel
to
keep
it
warm.
Dusk
was
settling
outside.
On
the
walls
the
crows
muttered
round
the
heads
like
courtiers
round
a
king.
One
of
the
guards
held
the
door
to
Kingspyre.
вЂњHope
thatвЂ™s
not
weasel
soup,вЂќ
he
jested.

Roose
Bolton
was
seated
by
the
hearth
reading
from
a
thick
leatherbound
book
when
she
entered.
вЂњLight
some
candles,вЂќ
he
commanded
her
as
he
turned
a
page.
вЂњIt
grows
gloomy
in
here.вЂќ

She
placed
the
food
at
his
elbow
and
did
as
he
bid
her,
filling
the
room
with
flickering
light
and
the
scent
of
cloves.
Bolton
turned
a
few
more
pages
with
his
finger,
then
closed
the
book
and
placed
it
carefully
in
the
fire.
He
watched
the
flames
consume
it,
pale
eyes
shining
with
reflected
light.
The
old
dry
leather
went
up
with
a
whoosh,
and
the
yellow
pages
stirred
as
they
burned,
as
if
some
ghost
were
reading
them.
вЂњI
will
have
no
further
need
of
you
tonight,вЂќ
he
said,
never
looking
at
her.

She
should
have
gone,
silent
as
a
mouse,
but
something
had
hold
of
her.
вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
she
asked,
вЂњwill
you
take
me
with
you
when
you
leave
Harrenhal?вЂќ

He
turned
to
stare
at
her,
and
from
the
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
as
if
his
supper
had
just
spoken
to
him.
вЂњDid
I
give
you
leave
to
question
me,
Nan?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
my
lord.вЂќ
She
lowered
her
eyes.

вЂњYou
should
not
have
spoken,
then.
Should
you?вЂќ

вЂњNo.
My
lord.вЂќ

For
a
moment
he
looked
amused.
вЂњI
will
answer
you,
just
this
once.
I
mean
to
give
Harrenhal
to
Lord
Vargo
when
I
return
to
the
north.
You
will
remain
here,
with
him.вЂќ

вЂњBut
I
donвЂ™tвЂ”вЂќ
she
started.

He
cut
her
off.
вЂњI
am
not
in
the
habit
of
being
questioned
by
servants,
Nan.
Must
I
have
your
tongue
out?вЂќ

He
would
do
it
as
easily
as
another
man
might
cuff
a
dog,
she
knew.
вЂњNo,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњThen
IвЂ™ll
hear
no
more
from
you?вЂќ

вЂњNo,
my
lord.вЂќ

вЂњGo,
then.
I
shall
forget
this
insolence.вЂќ

Arya
went,
but
not
to
her
bed.
When
she
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
yard,
the
guard
on
the
door
nodded
at
her
and
said,
вЂњStorm
coming.
Smell
the
air?вЂќ
The
wind
was
gusting,
flames
swirling
off
the
torches
mounted
atop
the
walls
beside
the
rows
of
heads.
On
her
way
to
the
godswood,
she
passed
the
Wailing
Tower
where
once
she
had
lived
in
fear
of
Weese.
The
Freys
had
taken
it
for
their
own
since
HarrenhalвЂ™s
fall.
She
could
hear
angry
voices
coming
from
a
window,
many
men
talking
and
arguing
all
at
once.
Elmar
was
sitting
on
the
steps
outside,
alone.

вЂњWhatвЂ™s
wrong?вЂќ
Arya
asked
him
when
she
saw
the
tears
shining
on
his
cheeks.

вЂњMy
princess,вЂќ
he
sobbed.
вЂњWeвЂ™ve
been
dishonored,
Aenys
says.
There
was
a
bird
from
the
Twins.
My
lord
father
says
IвЂ™ll
need
to
marry
someone
else,
or
be
a
septon.вЂќ

A
stupid
princess,
she
thought,
thatвЂ™s
nothing
to
cry
over.
вЂњMy
brothers
might
be
dead,вЂќ
she
confided.

Elmar
gave
her
a
scornful
look.
вЂњNo
one
cares
about
a
serving
girlвЂ™s
brothers.вЂќ

It
was
hard
not
to
hit
him
when
he
said
that.
вЂњI
hope
your
princess
dies,вЂќ
she
said,
and
ran
off
before
he
could
grab
her.
In
the
godswood
she
found
her
broomstick
sword
where
she
had
left
it,
and
carried
it
to
the
heart
tree.
There
she
knelt.
Red
leaves
rustled.
Red
eyes
peered
inside
her.
The
eyes
of
the
gods.
вЂњTell
me
what
to
do,
you
gods,вЂќ
she
prayed.

For
a
long
moment
there
was
no
sound
but
the
wind
and
the
water
and
the
creak
of
leaf
and
limb.
And
then,
far
far
off,
beyond
the
godswood
and
the
haunted
towers
and
the
immense
stone
walls
of
Harrenhal,
from
somewhere
out
in
the
world,
came
the
long
lonely
howl
of
a
wolf.
Gooseprickles
rose
on
AryaвЂ™s
skin,
and
for
an
instant
she
felt
dizzy.
Then,
so
faintly,
it
seemed
as
if
she
heard
her
fatherвЂ™s
voice.
вЂњWhen
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies,
but
the
pack
survives,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњBut
there
is
no
pack,вЂќ
she
whispered
to
the
weirwood.
Bran
and
Rickon
were
dead,
the
Lannisters
had
Sansa,
Jon
had
gone
to
the
Wall.
вЂњIвЂ™m
not
even
me
now,
IвЂ™m
Nan.вЂќ

вЂњYou
are
Arya
of
Winterfell,
daughter
of
the
north.
You
told
me
you
could
be
strong.
You
have
the
wolf
blood
in
you.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wolf
blood.вЂќ
Arya
remembered
now.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
be
as
strong
as
Robb.
I
said
I
would.вЂќ
She
took
a
deep
breath,
then
lifted
the
broomstick
in
both
hands
and
brought
it
down
across
her
knee.
It
broke
with
a
loud
crack,
and
she
threw
the
pieces
aside.
I
am
a
direwolf,
and
done
with
wooden
teeth.

That
night
she
lay
in
her
narrow
bed
upon
the
scratchy
straw,
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
living
and
the
dead
whisper
and
argue
as
she
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise.
They
were
the
only
voices
she
trusted
anymore.
She
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
own
breath,
and
the
wolves
as
well,
a
great
pack
of
them
now.
They
are
closer
than
the
one
I
heard
in
the
godswood,
she
thought.
They
are
calling
to
me.

Finally
she
slipped
from
under
the
blanket,
wriggled
into
a
tunic,
and
padded
barefoot
down
the
stairs.
Roose
Bolton
was
a
cautious
man,
and
the
entrance
to
Kingspyre
was
guarded
day
and
night,
so
she
had
to
slip
out
of
a
narrow
cellar
window.
The
yard
was
still,
the
great
castle
lost
in
haunted
dreams.
Above,
the
wind
keened
through
the
Wailing
Tower.

At
the
forge
she
found
the
fires
extinguished
and
the
doors
closed
and
barred.
She
crept
in
a
window,
as
she
had
once
before.
Gendry
shared
a
mattress
with
two
other
apprentice
smiths.
She
crouched
in
the
loft
for
a
long
time
before
her
eyes
adjusted
enough
for
her
to
be
sure
that
he
was
the
one
on
the
end.
Then
she
put
a
hand
over
his
mouth
and
pinched
him.
His
eyes
opened.
He
could
not
have
been
very
deeply
asleep.
вЂњPlease,вЂќ
she
whispered.
She
took
her
hand
off
his
mouth
and
pointed.

For
a
moment
she
did
not
think
he
understood,
but
then
he
slid
out
from
under
the
blankets.
Naked,
he
padded
across
the
room,
shrugged
into
a
loose
roughspun
tunic,
and
climbed
down
from
the
loft
after
her.
The
other
sleepers
did
not
stir.
вЂњWhat
do
you
want
now?вЂќ
Gendry
said
in
a
low
angry
voice.

вЂњA
sword.вЂќ

вЂњBlackthumb
keeps
all
the
blades
locked
up,
I
told
you
that
a
hundred
times.
Is
this
for
Lord
Leech?вЂќ

вЂњFor
me.
Break
the
lock
with
your
hammer.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
break
my
hand,вЂќ
he
grumbled.
вЂњOr
worse.вЂќ

вЂњNot
if
you
run
off
with
me.вЂќ

вЂњRun,
and
theyвЂ™ll
catch
you
and
kill
you.вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™ll
do
you
worse.
Lord
Bolton
is
giving
Harrenhal
to
the
Bloody
Mummers,
he
told
me
so.вЂќ

Gendry
pushed
black
hair
out
of
his
eyes.
вЂњSo?вЂќ

She
looked
right
at
him,
fearless.
вЂњSo
when
Vargo
HoatвЂ™s
the
lord,
heвЂ™s
going
to
cut
off
the
feet
of
all
the
servants
to
keep
them
from
running
away.
The
smiths
too.вЂќ

вЂњThatвЂ™s
only
a
story,вЂќ
he
said
scornfully.

вЂњNo,
itвЂ™s
true,
I
heard
Lord
Vargo
say
so,вЂќ
she
lied.
вЂњHeвЂ™s
going
to
cut
one
foot
off
everyone.
The
left
one.
Go
to
the
kitchens
and
wake
Hot
Pie,
heвЂ™ll
do
what
you
say.
WeвЂ™ll
need
bread
or
oatcakes
or
something.
You
get
the
swords
and
IвЂ™ll
do
the
horses.
WeвЂ™ll
meet
near
the
postern
in
the
east
wall,
behind
the
Tower
of
Ghosts.
No
one
ever
comes
there.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
that
gate.
ItвЂ™s
guarded,
same
as
the
rest.вЂќ

вЂњSo?
You
wonвЂ™t
forget
the
swords?вЂќ

вЂњI
never
said
IвЂ™d
come.вЂќ

вЂњNo.
But
if
you
do,
you
wonвЂ™t
forget
the
swords?вЂќ

He
frowned.
вЂњNo,вЂќ
he
said
at
last.
вЂњI
guess
I
wonвЂ™t.вЂќ

Arya
reentered
Kingspyre
the
same
way
she
had
left
it,
and
stole
up
the
winding
steps
listening
for
footfalls.
In
her
cell,
she
stripped
to
the
skin
and
dressed
herself
carefully,
in
two
layers
of
smallclothes,
warm
stockings,
and
her
cleanest
tunic.
It
was
Lord
BoltonвЂ™s
livery.
On
the
breast
was
sewn
his
sigil,
the
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort.
She
tied
her
shoes,
threw
a
wool
cloak
over
her
skinny
shoulders,
and
knotted
it
under
her
throat.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
moved
back
down
the
stairs.
Outside
the
lordвЂ™s
solar
she
paused
to
listen
at
the
door,
easing
it
open
slowly
when
she
heard
only
silence.

The
sheepskin
map
was
on
the
table,
beside
the
remains
of
Lord
BoltonвЂ™s
supper.
She
rolled
it
up
tight
and
thrust
it
through
her
belt.
HeвЂ™d
left
his
dagger
on
the
table
as
well,
so
she
took
that
too,
just
in
case
Gendry
lost
his
courage.

A
horse
neighed
softly
as
she
slipped
into
the
darkened
stables.
The
grooms
were
all
asleep.
She
prodded
one
with
her
toe
until
he
sat
up
groggily
and
said,
вЂњEh?
Whas?вЂќ

вЂњLord
Bolton
requires
three
horses
saddled
and
bridled.вЂќ

The
boy
got
to
his
feet,
pushing
straw
from
his
hair.
вЂњWha,
at
this
hour?
Horses,
you
say?вЂќ
He
blinked
at
the
sigil
on
her
tunic.
вЂњWhas
he
want
horses
for,
in
the
dark?вЂќ

вЂњLord
Bolton
is
not
in
the
habit
of
being
questioned
by
servants.вЂќ
She
crossed
her
arms.

The
stableboy
was
still
looking
at
the
flayed
man.
He
knew
what
it
meant.
вЂњThree,
you
say?вЂќ

вЂњOne
two
three.
Hunting
horses.
Fast
and
surefoot.вЂќ
Arya
helped
him
with
the
bridles
and
saddles,
so
he
would
not
need
to
wake
any
of
the
others.
She
hoped
they
would
not
hurt
him
afterward,
but
she
knew
they
probably
would.

Leading
the
horses
across
the
castle
was
the
worst
part.
She
stayed
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
wall
whenever
she
could,
so
the
sentries
walking
their
rounds
on
the
ramparts
above
would
have
needed
to
look
almost
straight
down
to
see
her.
And
if
they
do,
what
of
it?
IвЂ™m
my
lordвЂ™s
own
cupbearer.
It
was
a
chill
dank
autumn
night.
Clouds
were
blowing
in
from
the
west,
hiding
the
stars,
and
the
Wailing
Tower
screamed
mournfully
at
every
gust
of
wind.
It
smells
like
rain.
Arya
did
not
know
whether
that
would
be
good
or
bad
for
their
escape.

No
one
saw
her,
and
she
saw
no
one,
only
a
grey
and
white
cat
creeping
along
atop
the
godswood
wall.
It
stopped
and
spit
at
her,
waking
memories
of
the
Red
Keep
and
her
father
and
Syrio
Forel.
вЂњI
could
catch
you
if
I
wanted,вЂќ
she
called
to
it
softly,
вЂњbut
I
have
to
go,
cat.вЂќ
The
cat
hissed
again
and
ran
off.

The
Tower
of
Ghosts
was
the
most
ruinous
of
HarrenhalвЂ™s
five
immense
towers.
It
stood
dark
and
desolate
behind
the
remains
of
a
collapsed
sept
where
only
rats
had
come
to
pray
for
near
three
hundred
years.
It
was
there
she
waited
to
see
if
Gendry
and
Hot
Pie
would
come.
It
seemed
as
though
she
waited
a
long
time.
The
horses
nibbled
at
the
weeds
that
grew
up
between
the
broken
stones
while
the
clouds
swallowed
the
last
of
the
stars.
Arya
took
out
the
dagger
and
sharpened
it
to
keep
her
hands
busy.
Long
smooth
strokes,
the
way
Syrio
had
taught
her.
The
sound
calmed
her.

She
heard
them
coming
long
before
she
saw
them.
Hot
Pie
was
breathing
heavily,
and
once
he
stumbled
in
the
dark,
barked
his
shin,
and
cursed
loud
enough
to
wake
half
of
Harrenhal.
Gendry
was
quieter,
but
the
swords
he
was
carrying
rang
together
as
he
moved.
вЂњHere
I
am.вЂќ
She
stood.
вЂњBe
quiet
or
theyвЂ™ll
hear
you.вЂќ

The
boys
picked
their
way
toward
her
over
tumbled
stones.
Gendry
was
wearing
oiled
chainmail
under
his
cloak,
she
saw,
and
he
had
his
blacksmithвЂ™s
hammer
slung
across
his
back.
Hot
PieвЂ™s
red
round
face
peered
out
from
under
a
hood.
He
had
a
sack
of
bread
dangling
from
his
right
hand
and
a
big
wheel
of
cheese
under
his
left
arm.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
guard
on
that
postern,вЂќ
said
Gendry
quietly.
вЂњI
told
you
there
would
be.вЂќ

вЂњYou
stay
here
with
the
horses,вЂќ
said
Arya.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
get
rid
of
him.
Come
quick
when
I
call.вЂќ

Gendry
nodded.
Hot
Pie
said,
вЂњHoot
like
an
owl
when
you
want
us
to
come.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
not
an
owl,вЂќ
said
Arya.
вЂњIвЂ™m
a
wolf.
IвЂ™ll
howl.вЂќ

Alone,
she
slid
through
the
shadow
of
the
Tower
of
Ghosts.
She
walked
fast,
to
keep
ahead
of
her
fear,
and
it
felt
as
though
Syrio
Forel
walked
beside
her,
and
Yoren,
and
Jaqen
HвЂ™ghar,
and
Jon
Snow.
She
had
not
taken
the
sword
Gendry
had
brought
her,
not
yet.
For
this
the
dagger
would
be
better.
It
was
good
and
sharp.
This
postern
was
the
least
of
HarrenhalвЂ™s
gates,
a
narrow
door
of
stout
oak
studded
with
iron
nails,
set
in
an
angle
of
the
wall
beneath
a
defensive
tower.
Only
one
man
was
set
to
guard
it,
but
she
knew
there
would
be
sentries
up
in
that
tower
as
well,
and
others
nearby
walking
the
walls.
Whatever
happened,
she
must
be
quiet
as
a
shadow.
He
must
not
call
out.
A
few
scattered
raindrops
had
begun
to
fall.
She
felt
one
land
on
her
brow
and
run
slowly
down
her
nose.

She
made
no
effort
to
hide,
but
approached
the
guard
openly,
as
if
Lord
Bolton
himself
had
sent
her.
He
watched
her
come,
curious
as
to
what
might
bring
a
page
here
at
this
black
hour.
When
she
got
closer,
she
saw
that
he
was
a
northman,
very
tall
and
thin,
huddled
in
a
ragged
fur
cloak.
That
was
bad.
She
might
have
been
able
to
trick
a
Frey
or
one
of
the
Brave
Companions,
but
the
Dreadfort
men
had
served
Roose
Bolton
their
whole
life,
and
they
knew
him
better
than
she
did.
If
I
tell
him
I
am
Arya
Stark
and
command
him
to
stand
asideвЂ¦
No,
she
dare
not.
He
was
a
northman,
but
not
a
Winterfell
man.
He
belonged
to
Roose
Bolton.

When
she
reached
him
she
pushed
back
her
cloak
so
he
would
see
the
flayed
man
on
her
breast.
вЂњLord
Bolton
sent
me.вЂќ

вЂњAt
this
hour?
Why
for?вЂќ

She
could
see
the
gleam
of
steel
under
the
fur,
and
she
did
not
know
if
she
was
strong
enough
to
drive
the
point
of
the
dagger
through
chainmail.
His
throat,
it
must
be
his
throat,
but
heвЂ™s
too
tall,
IвЂ™ll
never
reach
it.
For
a
moment
she
did
not
know
what
to
say.
For
a
moment
she
was
a
little
girl
again,
and
scared,
and
the
rain
on
her
face
felt
like
tears.

вЂњHe
told
me
to
give
all
his
guards
a
silver
piece,
for
their
good
service.вЂќ
The
words
seemed
to
come
out
of
nowhere.

вЂњSilver,
you
say?вЂќ
He
did
not
believe
her,
but
he
wanted
to;
silver
was
silver,
after
all.
вЂњGive
it
over,
then.вЂќ

Her
fingers
dug
down
beneath
her
tunic
and
came
out
clutching
the
coin
Jaqen
had
given
her.
In
the
dark
the
iron
could
pass
for
tarnished
silver.
She
held
it
outвЂ¦
and
let
it
slip
through
her
fingers.

Cursing
her
softly,
the
man
went
to
a
knee
to
grope
for
the
coin
in
the
dirt
and
there
was
his
neck
right
in
front
of
her.
Arya
slid
her
dagger
out
and
drew
it
across
his
throat,
as
smooth
as
summer
silk.
His
blood
covered
her
hands
in
a
hot
gush
and
he
tried
to
shout
but
there
was
blood
in
his
mouth
as
well.

вЂњValar
morghulis,вЂќ
she
whispered
as
he
died.

When
he
stopped
moving,
she
picked
up
the
coin.
Outside
the
walls
of
Harrenhal,
a
wolf
howled
long
and
loud.
She
lifted
the
bar,
set
it
aside,
and
pulled
open
the
heavy
oak
door.
By
the
time
Hot
Pie
and
Gendry
came
up
with
the
horses,
the
rain
was
falling
hard.
вЂњYou
killed
him!вЂќ
Hot
Pie
gasped.

вЂњWhat
did
you
think
I
would
do?вЂќ
Her
fingers
were
sticky
with
blood,
and
the
smell
was
making
her
mare
skittish.
ItвЂ™s
no
matter,
she
thought,
swinging
up
into
the
saddle.
The
rain
will
wash
them
clean
again.





SANSA

The
throne
room
was
a
sea
of
jewels,
furs,
and
bright
fabrics.
Lords
and
ladies
filled
the
back
of
the
hall
and
stood
beneath
the
high
windows,
jostling
like
fishwives
on
a
dock.

The
denizens
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
court
had
striven
to
outdo
each
other
today.
Jalabhar
Xho
was
all
in
feathers,
a
plumage
so
fantastic
and
extravagant
that
he
seemed
like
to
take
flight.
The
High
SeptonвЂ™s
crystal
crown
fired
rainbows
through
the
air
every
time
he
moved
his
head.
At
the
council
table,
Queen
Cersei
shimmered
in
a
cloth-of-gold
gown
slashed
in
burgundy
velvet,
while
beside
her
Varys
fussed
and
simpered
in
a
lilac
brocade.
Moon
Boy
and
Ser
Dontos
wore
new
suits
of
motley,
clean
as
a
spring
morning.
Even
Lady
Tanda
and
her
daughters
looked
pretty
in
matching
gowns
of
turquoise
silk
and
vair,
and
Lord
Gyles
was
coughing
into
a
square
of
scarlet
silk
trimmed
with
golden
lace.
King
Joffrey
sat
above
them
all,
amongst
the
blades
and
barbs
of
the
Iron
Throne.
He
was
in
crimson
samite,
his
black
mantle
studded
with
rubies,
on
his
head
his
heavy
golden
crown.

Squirming
through
a
press
of
knights,
squires,
and
rich
townfolk,
Sansa
reached
the
front
of
the
gallery
just
as
a
blast
of
trumpets
announced
the
entry
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister.

He
rode
his
warhorse
down
the
length
of
the
hall
and
dismounted
before
the
Iron
Throne.
Sansa
had
never
seen
such
armor;
all
burnished
red
steel,
inlaid
with
golden
scrollwork
and
ornamentation.
His
rondels
were
sunbursts,
the
roaring
lion
that
crowned
his
helm
had
ruby
eyes,
and
a
lioness
on
each
shoulder
fastened
a
cloth-of-gold
cloak
so
long
and
heavy
that
it
draped
the
hindquarters
of
his
charger.
Even
the
horseвЂ™s
armor
was
gilded,
and
his
bardings
were
shimmering
crimson
silk
emblazoned
with
the
lion
of
Lannister.

The
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
made
such
an
impressive
figure
that
it
was
a
shock
when
his
destrier
dropped
a
load
of
dung
right
at
the
base
of
the
throne.
Joffrey
had
to
step
gingerly
around
it
as
he
descended
to
embrace
his
grandfather
and
proclaim
him
Savior
of
the
City.
Sansa
covered
her
mouth
to
hide
a
nervous
smile.

Joff
made
a
show
of
asking
his
grandfather
to
assume
governance
of
the
realm,
and
Lord
Tywin
solemnly
accepted
the
responsibility,
вЂњuntil
Your
Grace
does
come
of
age.вЂќ
Then
squires
removed
his
armor
and
Joff
fastened
the
HandвЂ™s
chain
of
office
around
his
neck.
Lord
Tywin
took
a
seat
at
the
council
table
beside
the
queen.
After
the
destrier
was
led
off
and
his
homage
removed,
Cersei
nodded
for
the
ceremonies
to
continue.

A
fanfare
of
brazen
trumpets
greeted
each
of
the
heroes
as
he
stepped
between
the
great
oaken
doors.
Heralds
cried
his
name
and
deeds
for
all
to
hear,
and
the
noble
knights
and
highborn
ladies
cheered
as
lustily
as
cutthroats
at
a
cockfight.
Pride
of
place
was
given
to
Mace
Tyrell,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden,
a
once-powerful
man
gone
to
fat,
yet
still
handsome.
His
sons
followed
him
in;
Ser
Loras
and
his
older
brother
Ser
Garlan
the
Gallant.
The
three
dressed
alike,
in
green
velvet
trimmed
with
sable.

The
king
descended
the
throne
once
more
to
greet
them,
a
great
honor.
He
fastened
about
the
throat
of
each
a
chain
of
roses
wrought
in
soft
yellow
gold,
from
which
hung
a
golden
disc
with
the
lion
of
Lannister
picked
out
in
rubies.
вЂњThe
roses
support
the
lion,
as
the
might
of
Highgarden
supports
the
realm,вЂќ
proclaimed
Joffrey.
вЂњIf
there
is
any
boon
you
would
ask
of
me,
ask
and
it
shall
be
yours.вЂќ

And
now
it
comes,
thought
Sansa.

вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
said
Ser
Loras,
вЂњI
beg
the
honor
of
serving
in
your
Kingsguard,
to
defend
you
against
your
enemies.вЂќ

Joffrey
drew
the
Knight
of
Flowers
to
his
feet
and
kissed
him
on
his
cheek.
вЂњDone,
brother.вЂќ

Lord
Tyrell
bowed
his
head.
вЂњThere
is
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
serve
the
KingвЂ™s
Grace.
If
I
was
deemed
worthy
to
join
your
royal
council,
you
would
find
none
more
loyal
or
true.вЂќ

Joff
put
a
hand
on
Lord
TyrellвЂ™s
shoulder
and
kissed
him
when
he
stood.
вЂњYour
wish
is
granted.вЂќ

Ser
Garlan
Tyrell,
five
years
senior
to
Ser
Loras,
was
a
taller
bearded
version
of
his
more
famous
younger
brother.
He
was
thicker
about
the
chest
and
broader
at
the
shoulders,
and
though
his
face
was
comely
enough,
he
lacked
Ser
LorasвЂ™s
startling
beauty.
вЂњYour
Grace,вЂќ
Garlan
said
when
the
king
approached
him,
вЂњI
have
a
maiden
sister,
Margaery,
the
delight
of
our
House.
She
was
wed
to
Renly
Baratheon,
as
you
know,
but
Lord
Renly
went
to
war
before
the
marriage
could
be
consummated,
so
she
remains
innocent.
Margaery
has
heard
tales
of
your
wisdom,
courage,
and
chivalry,
and
has
come
to
love
you
from
afar.
I
beseech
you
to
send
for
her,
to
take
her
hand
in
marriage,
and
to
wed
your
House
to
mine
for
all
time.вЂќ

King
Joffrey
made
a
show
of
looking
surprised.
вЂњSer
Garlan,
your
sisterвЂ™s
beauty
is
famed
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
I
am
promised
to
another.
A
king
must
keep
his
word.вЂќ

Queen
Cersei
got
to
her
feet
in
a
rustle
of
skirts.
вЂњYour
Grace,
in
the
judgment
of
your
small
council,
it
would
be
neither
proper
nor
wise
for
you
to
wed
the
daughter
of
a
man
beheaded
for
treason,
a
girl
whose
brother
is
in
open
rebellion
against
the
throne
even
now.
Sire,
your
councillors
beg
you,
for
the
good
of
your
realm,
set
Sansa
Stark
aside.
The
Lady
Margaery
will
make
you
a
far
more
suitable
queen.вЂќ

Like
a
pack
of
trained
dogs,
the
lords
and
ladies
in
the
hall
began
to
shout
their
pleasure.
вЂњMargaery,вЂќ
they
called.
вЂњGive
us
Margaery!вЂќ
and
вЂњNo
traitor
queens!
Tyrell!
Tyrell!вЂќ

Joffrey
raised
a
hand.
вЂњI
would
like
to
heed
the
wishes
of
my
people,
Mother,
but
I
took
a
holy
vow.вЂќ

The
High
Septon
stepped
forward.
вЂњYour
Grace,
the
gods
hold
bethrothal
solemn,
but
your
father,
King
Robert
of
blessed
memory,
made
this
pact
before
the
Starks
of
Winterfell
had
revealed
their
falseness.
Their
crimes
against
the
realm
have
freed
you
from
any
promise
you
might
have
made.
So
far
as
the
Faith
is
concerned,
there
is
no
valid
marriage
contract
вЂ™twixt
you
and
Sansa
Stark.вЂќ

A
tumult
of
cheering
filled
the
throne
room,
and
cries
of
вЂњMargaery,
MargaeryвЂќ
erupted
all
around
her.
Sansa
leaned
forward,
her
hands
tight
around
the
galleryвЂ™s
wooden
rail.
She
knew
what
came
next,
but
she
was
still
frightened
of
what
Joffrey
might
say,
afraid
that
he
would
refuse
to
release
her
even
now,
when
his
whole
kingdom
depended
upon
it.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
back
again
on
the
marble
steps
outside
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
waiting
for
her
prince
to
grant
her
father
mercy,
and
instead
hearing
him
command
Ilyn
Payne
to
strike
off
his
head.
Please,
she
prayed
fervently,
make
him
say
it,
make
him
say
it.

Lord
Tywin
was
looking
at
his
grandson.
Joff
gave
him
a
sullen
glance,
shifted
his
feet,
and
helped
Ser
Garlan
Tyrell
to
rise.
вЂњThe
gods
are
good.
I
am
free
to
heed
my
heart.
I
will
wed
your
sweet
sister,
and
gladly,
ser.вЂќ
He
kissed
Ser
Garlan
on
a
bearded
cheek
as
the
cheers
rose
all
around
them.

Sansa
felt
curiously
light-headed.
I
am
free.
She
could
feel
eyes
upon
her.
I
must
not
smile,
she
reminded
herself.
The
queen
had
warned
her;
no
matter
what
she
felt
inside,
the
face
she
showed
the
world
must
look
distraught.
вЂњI
will
not
have
my
son
humiliated,вЂќ
Cersei
said.
вЂњDo
you
hear
me?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
But
if
IвЂ™m
not
to
be
queen,
what
will
become
of
me?вЂќ

вЂњThat
will
need
to
be
determined.
For
the
moment,
you
shall
remain
here
at
court,
as
our
ward.вЂќ

вЂњI
want
to
go
home.вЂќ

The
queen
was
irritated
by
that.
вЂњYou
should
have
learned
by
now,
none
of
us
get
the
things
we
want.вЂќ

I
have,
though,
Sansa
thought.
I
am
free
of
Joffrey.
I
will
not
have
to
kiss
him,
nor
give
him
my
maidenhood,
nor
bear
him
children.
Let
Margaery
Tyrell
have
all
that,
poor
girl.

By
the
time
the
outburst
died
down,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden
had
been
seated
at
the
council
table,
and
his
sons
had
joined
the
other
knights
and
lordlings
beneath
the
windows.
Sansa
tried
to
look
forlorn
and
abandoned
as
other
heroes
of
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
were
summoned
forth
to
receive
their
rewards.

Paxter
Redwyne,
Lord
of
the
Arbor,
marched
down
the
length
of
the
hall
flanked
by
his
twin
sons
Horror
and
Slobber,
the
former
limping
from
a
wound
taken
in
the
battle.
After
them
followed
Lord
Mathis
Rowan
in
a
snowy
doublet
with
a
great
tree
worked
upon
the
breast
in
gold
thread;
Lord
Randyll
Tarly,
lean
and
balding,
a
greatsword
across
his
back
in
a
jeweled
scabbard;
Ser
Kevan
Lannister,
a
thickset
balding
man
with
a
close-trimmed
beard;
Ser
Addam
Marbrand,
coppery
hair
streaming
to
his
shoulders;
the
great
western
lords
Lydden,
Crakehall,
and
Brax.

Next
came
four
of
lesser
birth
who
had
distinguished
themselves
in
the
fighting:
the
one-eyed
knight
Ser
Philip
Foote,
who
had
slain
Lord
Bryce
Caron
in
single
combat;
the
freerider
Lothor
Brune,
whoвЂ™d
cut
his
way
through
half
a
hundred
Fossoway
men-at-arms
to
capture
Ser
Jon
of
the
green
apple
and
kill
Ser
Bryan
and
Ser
Edwyd
of
the
red,
thereby
winning
himself
the
name
Lothor
Apple-Eater;
Willit,
a
grizzled
man-atarms
in
the
service
of
Ser
Harys
Swyft,
whoвЂ™d
pulled
his
master
from
beneath
his
dying
horse
and
defended
him
against
a
dozen
attackers;
and
a
downy-cheeked
squire
named
Josmyn
Peckledon,
who
had
killed
two
knights,
wounded
a
third,
and
captured
two
more,
though
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
fourteen.
Willit
was
borne
in
on
a
litter,
so
grievous
were
his
wounds.

Ser
Kevan
had
taken
a
seat
beside
his
brother
Lord
Tywin.
When
the
heralds
had
finished
telling
of
each
heroвЂ™s
deeds,
he
rose.
вЂњIt
is
His
GraceвЂ™s
wish
that
these
good
men
be
rewarded
for
their
valor.
By
his
decree,
Ser
Philip
shall
henceforth
be
Lord
Philip
of
House
Foote,
and
to
him
shall
go
all
the
lands,
rights,
and
incomes
of
House
Caron.
Lothor
Brune
to
be
raised
to
the
estate
of
knighthood,
and
granted
land
and
keep
in
the
riverlands
at
warвЂ™s
end.
To
Josmyn
Peckledon,
a
sword
and
suit
of
plate,
his
choice
of
any
warhorse
in
the
royal
stables,
and
knighthood
as
soon
as
he
shall
come
of
age.
And
lastly,
for
Goodman
Willit,
a
spear
with
a
silver-banded
haft,
a
hauberk
of
new-forged
ringmail,
and
a
full
helm
with
visor.
Further,
the
goodmanвЂ™s
sons
shall
be
taken
into
the
service
of
House
Lannister
at
Casterly
Rock,
the
elder
as
a
squire
and
the
younger
as
a
page,
with
the
chance
to
advance
to
knighthood
if
they
serve
loyally
and
well.
To
all
this,
the
KingвЂ™s
Hand
and
the
small
council
consent.вЂќ

The
captains
of
the
kingвЂ™s
warships
Wildwind,
Prince
Aemon,
and
River
Arrow
were
honored
next,
along
with
some
under
officers
from
Godsgrace,
Lance,
Lady
of
Silk,
and
Ramshead.
As
near
as
Sansa
could
tell,
their
chief
accomplishment
had
been
surviving
the
battle
on
the
river,
a
feat
that
few
enough
could
boast.
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
and
the
masters
of
the
AlchemistsвЂ™
Guild
received
the
kingвЂ™s
thanks
as
well,
and
Hallyne
was
raised
to
the
style
of
lord,
though
Sansa
noted
that
neither
lands
nor
castle
accompanied
the
title,
which
made
the
alchemist
no
more
a
true
lord
than
Varys
was.
A
more
significant
lordship
by
far
was
granted
to
Ser
Lancel
Lannister.
Joffrey
awarded
him
the
lands,
castle,
and
rights
of
House
Darry,
whose
last
child
lord
had
perished
during
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands,
вЂњleaving
no
trueborn
heirs
of
lawful
Darry
blood,
but
only
a
bastard
cousin.вЂќ

Ser
Lancel
did
not
appear
to
accept
the
title;
the
talk
was,
his
wound
might
cost
him
his
arm
or
even
his
life.
The
Imp
was
said
to
be
dying
as
well,
from
a
terrible
cut
to
the
head.

When
the
herald
called,
вЂњLord
Petyr
Baelish,вЂќ
he
came
forth
dressed
all
in
shades
of
rose
and
plum,
his
cloak
patterned
with
mockingbirds.
She
could
see
him
smiling
as
he
knelt
before
the
Iron
Throne.
He
looks
so
pleased.
Sansa
had
not
heard
of
Littlefinger
doing
anything
especially
heroic
during
the
battle,
but
it
seemed
he
was
to
be
rewarded
all
the
same.

Ser
Kevan
got
back
to
his
feet.
вЂњIt
is
the
wish
of
the
KingвЂ™s
Grace
that
his
loyal
councillor
Petyr
Baelish
be
rewarded
for
faithful
service
to
crown
and
realm.
Be
it
known
that
Lord
Baelish
is
granted
the
castle
of
Harrenhal
with
all
its
attendant
lands
and
incomes,
there
to
make
his
seat
and
rule
henceforth
as
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident.
Petyr
Baelish
and
his
sons
and
grandsons
shall
hold
and
enjoy
these
honors
until
the
end
of
time,
and
all
the
lords
of
the
Trident
shall
do
him
homage
as
their
rightful
liege.
The
KingвЂ™s
Hand
and
the
small
council
consent.вЂќ

On
his
knees,
Littlefinger
raised
his
eyes
to
King
Joffrey.
вЂњI
thank
you
humbly,
Your
Grace.
I
suppose
this
means
IвЂ™ll
need
to
see
about
getting
some
sons
and
grandsons.вЂќ

Joffrey
laughed,
and
the
court
with
him.
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident,
Sansa
thought,
and
Lord
of
Harrenhal
as
well.
She
did
not
understand
why
that
should
make
him
so
happy;
the
honors
were
as
empty
as
the
title
granted
to
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer.
Harrenhal
was
cursed,
everyone
knew
that,
and
the
Lannisters
did
not
even
hold
it
at
present.
Besides,
the
lords
of
the
Trident
were
sworn
to
Riverrun
and
House
Tully,
and
to
the
King
in
the
North;
they
would
never
accept
Littlefinger
as
their
liege.
Unless
they
are
made
to.
Unless
my
brother
and
my
uncle
and
my
grandfather
are
all
cast
down
and
killed.
The
thought
made
Sansa
anxious,
but
she
told
herself
she
was
being
silly.
Robb
has
beaten
them
every
time.
HeвЂ™ll
beat
Lord
Baelish
too,
if
he
must.

More
than
six
hundred
new
knights
were
made
that
day.
They
had
held
their
vigil
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
all
through
the
night
and
crossed
the
city
barefoot
that
morning
to
prove
their
humble
hearts.
Now
they
came
forward
dressed
in
shifts
of
undyed
wool
to
receive
their
knighthoods
from
the
Kingsguard.
It
took
a
long
time,
since
only
three
of
the
Brothers
of
the
White
Sword
were
on
hand
to
dub
them.
Mandon
Moore
had
perished
in
the
battle,
the
Hound
had
vanished,
Aerys
Oakheart
was
in
Dorne
with
Princess
Myrcella,
and
Jaime
Lannister
was
RobbвЂ™s
captive,
so
the
Kingsguard
had
been
reduced
to
Balon
Swann,
Meryn
Trant,
and
Osmund
Kettleblack.
Once
knighted,
each
man
rose,
buckled
on
his
swordbelt,
and
stood
beneath
the
windows.
Some
had
bloody
feet
from
their
walk
through
the
city,
but
they
stood
tall
and
proud
all
the
same,
it
seemed
to
Sansa.

By
the
time
all
the
new
knights
had
been
given
their
sers
the
hall
was
growing
restive,
and
none
more
so
than
Joffrey.
Some
of
those
in
the
gallery
had
begun
to
slip
quietly
away,
but
the
notables
on
the
floor
were
trapped,
unable
to
depart
without
the
kingвЂ™s
leave.
Judging
by
the
way
he
was
fidgeting
atop
the
Iron
Throne,
Joff
would
willingly
have
granted
it,
but
the
dayвЂ™s
work
was
far
from
done.
For
now
the
coin
was
turned
over,
and
the
captives
were
ushered
in.

There
were
great
lords
and
noble
knights
in
that
company
too:
sour
old
Lord
Celtigar,
the
Red
Crab;
Ser
Bonifer
the
Good;
Lord
Estermont,
more
ancient
even
than
Celtigar;
Lord
Varner,
who
hobbled
the
length
of
the
hall
on
a
shattered
knee,
but
would
accept
no
help;
Ser
Mark
Mullendore,
grey-faced,
his
left
arm
gone
to
the
elbow;
fierce
Red
Ronnet
of
Griffin
Roost;
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood;
Lord
Willurn
and
his
sons
Josua
and
Elyas;
Ser
Jon
Fossoway;
Ser
Timon
the
Scrapesword;
Aurane,
the
bastard
of
Driftmark;
Lord
Staedmon,
called
Pennylover;
hundreds
of
others.

Those
who
had
changed
their
allegiance
during
the
battle
needed
only
to
swear
fealty
to
Joffrey,
but
the
ones
who
had
fought
for
Stannis
until
the
bitter
end
were
compelled
to
speak.
Their
words
decided
their
fate.
If
they
begged
forgiveness
for
their
treasons
and
promised
to
serve
loyally
henceforth,
Joffrey
welcomed
them
back
into
the
kingвЂ™s
peace
and
restored
them
to
all
their
lands
and
rights.
A
handful
remained
defiant,
however.
вЂњDo
not
imagine
this
is
done,
boy,вЂќ
warned
one,
the
bastard
son
of
some
Florent
or
other.
вЂњThe
Lord
of
Light
protects
King
Stannis,
now
and
always.
All
your
swords
and
all
your
scheming
shall
not
save
you
when
his
hour
comes.вЂќ

вЂњYour
hour
is
come
right
now.вЂќ
Joffrey
beckoned
to
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
to
take
the
man
out
and
strike
his
head
off.
But
no
sooner
had
that
one
been
dragged
away
than
a
knight
of
solemn
mien
with
a
fiery
heart
on
his
surcoat
shouted
out,
вЂњStannis
is
the
true
king!
A
monster
sits
the
Iron
Throne,
an
abomination
born
of
incest!вЂќ

вЂњBe
silent,вЂќ
Ser
Kevan
Lannister
bellowed.

The
knight
raised
his
voice
instead.
вЂњJoffrey
is
the
black
worm
eating
the
heart
of
the
realm!
Darkness
was
his
father,
and
death
his
mother!
Destroy
him
before
he
corrupts
you
all!
Destroy
them
all,
queen
whore
and
king
worm,
vile
dwarf
and
whispering
spider,
the
false
flowers.
Save
yourselves!вЂќ
One
of
the
gold
cloaks
knocked
the
man
off
his
feet,
but
he
continued
to
shout.
вЂњThe
scouring
fire
will
come!
King
Stannis
will
return!
вЂњ

Joffrey
lurched
to
his
feet.
вЂњIвЂ™m
king!
Kill
him!
Kill
him
now!
I
command
it.вЂќ
He
chopped
down
with
his
hand,
a
furious,
angry
gestureвЂ¦
and
screeched
in
pain
when
his
arm
brushed
against
one
of
the
sharp
metal
fangs
that
surrounded
him.
The
bright
crimson
samite
of
his
sleeve
turned
a
darker
shade
of
red
as
his
blood
soaked
through
it.
вЂњMother!вЂќ
he
wailed.

With
every
eye
on
the
king,
somehow
the
man
on
the
floor
wrested
a
spear
away
from
one
of
the
gold
cloaks,
and
used
it
to
push
himself
back
to
his
feet.
вЂњThe
throne
denies
him!вЂќ
he
cried.
вЂњHe
is
no
king!вЂќ

Cersei
was
running
toward
the
throne,
but
Lord
Tywin
remained
still
as
stone.
He
had
only
to
raise
a
finger,
and
Ser
Meryn
Trant
moved
forward
with
drawn
sword.
The
end
was
quick
and
brutal.
The
gold
cloaks
seized
the
knight
by
the
arms.
вЂњNo
king!вЂќ
he
cried
again
as
Ser
Meryn
drove
the
point
of
his
longsword
through
his
chest.

Joff
fell
into
his
motherвЂ™s
arms.
Three
maesters
came
hurrying
forward,
to
bundle
him
out
through
the
kingвЂ™s
door.
Then
everyone
began
talking
at
once.
When
the
gold
cloaks
dragged
off
the
dead
man,
he
left
a
trail
of
bright
blood
across
the
stone
floor.
Lord
Baelish
stroked
his
beard
while
Varys
whispered
in
his
ear.
Will
they
dismiss
us
now?
Sansa
wondered.
A
score
of
captives
still
waited,
though
whether
to
pledge
fealty
or
shout
curses,
who
could
say?

Lord
Tywin
rose
to
his
feet.
вЂњWe
continue,вЂќ
he
said
in
a
clear
strong
voice
that
silenced
the
murmurs.
вЂњThose
who
wish
to
ask
pardon
for
their
treasons
may
do
so.
We
will
have
no
more
follies.вЂќ
He
moved
to
the
Iron
Throne
and
there
seated
himself
on
a
step,
a
mere
three
feet
off
the
floor.

The
light
outside
the
windows
was
fading
by
the
time
the
session
drew
to
a
close.
Sansa
felt
limp
with
exhaustion
as
she
made
her
way
down
from
the
gallery.
She
wondered
how
badly
Joffrey
had
cut
himself.
They
say
the
Iron
Throne
can
be
perilous
cruel
to
those
who
were
not
meant
to
sit
it.

Back
in
the
safety
of
her
own
chambers,
she
hugged
a
pillow
to
her
face
to
muffle
a
squeal
of
joy.
Oh,
gods
be
good,
he
did
it,
he
put
me
aside
in
front
of
everyone.
When
a
serving
girl
brought
her
supper,
she
almost
kissed
her.
There
was
hot
bread
and
fresh-churned
butter,
a
thick
beef
soup,
capon
and
carrots,
and
peaches
in
honey.
Even
the
food
tastes
sweeter,
she
thought.

Come
dark,
she
slipped
into
a
cloak
and
left
for
the
godswood.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
was
guarding
the
drawbridge
in
his
white
armor.
Sansa
tried
her
best
to
sound
miserable
as
she
bid
him
a
good
evening.
From
the
way
he
leered
at
her,
she
was
not
sure
she
had
been
wholly
convincing.

Dontos
waited
in
the
leafy
moonlight.
вЂњWhy
so
sadface?вЂќ
Sansa
asked
him
gaily.
вЂњYou
were
there,
you
heard.
Joff
put
me
aside,
heвЂ™s
done
with
me,
heвЂ™sвЂ¦вЂќ

He
took
her
hand.
вЂњOh,
Jonquil,
my
poor
Jonquil,
you
do
not
understand.
Done
with
you?
TheyвЂ™ve
scarcely
begun.вЂќ

Her
heart
sank.
вЂњWhat
do
you
mean?вЂќ

вЂњThe
queen
will
never
let
you
go,
never.
You
are
too
valuable
a
hostage.
And
JoffreyвЂ¦
sweetling,
he
is
still
king.
If
he
wants
you
in
his
bed,
he
will
have
you,
only
now
it
will
be
bastards
he
plants
in
your
womb
instead
of
trueborn
sons.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
Sansa
said,
shocked.
вЂњHe
let
me
go,
heвЂ¦вЂќ

Ser
Dontos
planted
a
slobbery
kiss
on
her
ear.
вЂњBe
brave.
I
swore
to
see
you
home,
and
now
I
can.
The
day
has
been
chosen.вЂќ

вЂњWhen?вЂќ
Sansa
asked.
вЂњWhen
will
we
go?вЂќ

вЂњThe
night
of
JoffreyвЂ™s
wedding.
After
the
feast.
All
the
necessary
arrangements
have
been
made.
The
Red
Keep
will
be
full
of
strangers.
Half
the
court
will
be
drunk
and
the
other
half
will
be
helping
Joffrey
bed
his
bride.
For
a
little
while,
you
will
be
forgotten,
and
the
confusion
will
be
our
friend.вЂќ

вЂњThe
wedding
wonвЂ™t
be
for
a
moonвЂ™s
turn
yet.
Margaery
Tyrell
is
at
Highgarden,
theyвЂ™ve
only
now
sent
for
her.вЂќ

вЂњYouвЂ™ve
waited
so
long,
be
patient
awhile
longer.
Here,
I
have
something
for
you.вЂќ
Ser
Dontos
fumbled
in
his
pouch
and
drew
out
a
silvery
spiderweb,
dangling
it
between
his
thick
fingers.
It
was
a
hair
net
of
fine-spun
silver,
the
strands
so
thin
and
delicate
the
net
seemed
to
weigh
no
more
than
a
breath
of
air
when
Sansa
took
it
in
her
fingers.
Small
gems
were
set
wherever
two
strands
crossed,
so
dark
they
drank
the
moonlight.
вЂњWhat
stones
are
these?вЂќ

вЂњBlack
amethysts
from
Asshai.
The
rarest
kind,
a
deep
true
purple
by
daylight.вЂќ

вЂњItвЂ™s
very
lovely,вЂќ
Sansa
said,
thinking,
It
is
a
ship
I
need,
not
a
net
for
my
hair.

вЂњLovelier
than
you
know,
sweet
child.
ItвЂ™s
magic,
you
see.
ItвЂ™s
justice
you
hold.
ItвЂ™s
vengeance
for
your
father.вЂќ
Dontos
leaned
close
and
kissed
her
again.
вЂњItвЂ™s
home.вЂќ





THEON

Maester
Luwin
came
to
him
when
the
first
scouts
were
seen
outside
the
walls.
вЂњMy
lord
prince,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњyou
must
yield.вЂќ

Theon
stared
at
the
platter
of
oakcakes,
honey,
and
blood
sausage
theyвЂ™d
brought
him
to
break
his
fast.
Another
sleepless
night
had
left
his
nerves
raw,
and
the
very
sight
of
food
sickened
him.
вЂњThere
has
been
no
reply
from
my
uncle?вЂќ

вЂњNone,вЂќ
the
maester
said.
вЂњNor
from
your
father
on
Pyke.вЂќ

вЂњSend
more
birds.вЂќ

вЂњIt
will
not
serve.
By
the
time
the
birds
reachвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњSend
them!вЂќ
Knocking
the
platter
of
food
aside
with
a
swipe
of
his
arm,
he
pushed
off
the
blankets
and
rose
from
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
bed
naked
and
angry.
вЂњOr
do
you
want
me
dead?
Is
that
it,
Luwin?
The
truth
now.вЂќ

The
small
grey
man
was
unafraid.
вЂњMy
order
serves.вЂќ

вЂњYes,
but
whom?вЂќ

вЂњThe
realm,вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
said,
вЂњand
Winterfell.
Theon,
once
I
taught
you
sums
and
letters,
history
and
warcraft.
And
might
have
taught
you
more,
had
you
wished
to
learn.
I
will
not
claim
to
bear
you
any
great
love,
no,
but
I
cannot
hate
you
either.
Even
if
I
did,
so
long
as
you
hold
Winterfell
I
am
bound
by
oath
to
give
you
counsel.
So
now
I
counsel
you
to
yield.вЂќ

Theon
stooped
to
scoop
a
puddled
cloak
off
the
floor,
shook
off
the
rushes,
and
draped
it
over
his
shoulders.
A
fire,
IвЂ™ll
have
a
fire,
and
clean
garb.
WhereвЂ™s
Wex?
IвЂ™ll
not
go
to
my
grave
in
dirty
clothes.

вЂњYou
have
no
hope
of
holding
here,вЂќ
the
maester
went
on.
вЂњIf
your
lord
father
meant
to
send
you
aid,
he
would
have
done
so
by
now.
It
is
the
Neck
that
concerns
him.
The
battle
for
the
north
will
be
fought
amidst
the
ruins
of
Moat
Cailin.вЂќ

вЂњThat
may
be
so,вЂќ
said
Theon.
вЂњAnd
so
long
as
I
hold
Winterfell,
Ser
Rodrik
and
StarkвЂ™s
lords
bannermen
cannot
march
south
to
take
my
uncle
in
the
rear.вЂќ
I
am
not
so
innocent
of
warcraft
as
you
think,
old
man.
вЂњI
have
food
enough
to
stand
a
yearвЂ™s
siege,
if
need
be.вЂќ

вЂњThere
will
be
no
siege.
Perhaps
they
will
spend
a
day
or
two
fashioning
ladders
and
tying
grapnels
to
the
ends
of
ropes.
But
soon
enough
they
will
come
over
your
walls
in
a
hundred
places
at
once.
You
may
be
able
to
hold
the
keep
for
a
time,
but
the
castle
will
fall
within
the
hour.
You
would
do
better
to
open
your
gates
and
ask
forвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњвЂ”mercy?
I
know
what
kind
of
mercy
they
have
for
me.вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
a
way.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
ironborn,вЂќ
Theon
reminded
him.
вЂњI
have
my
own
way.
What
choice
have
they
left
me?
No,
donвЂ™t
answer,
IвЂ™ve
heard
enough
of
your
counsel.
Go
and
send
those
birds
as
I
commanded,
and
tell
Lorren
I
want
to
see
him.
And
Wex
as
well.
IвЂ™ll
have
my
mail
scoured
clean,
and
my
garrison
assembled
in
the
yard.вЂќ

For
a
moment
he
thought
the
maester
was
going
to
defy
him.
But
finally
Luwin
bowed
stiffly.
вЂњAs
you
command.вЂќ

They
made
a
pitifully
small
assembly;
the
ironmen
were
few,
the
yard
large.
вЂњThe
northmen
will
be
on
us
before
nightfall,вЂќ
he
told
them.
вЂњSer
Rodrik
Cassel
and
all
the
lords
who
have
come
to
his
call.
I
will
not
run
from
them.
I
took
this
castle
and
I
mean
to
hold
it,
to
live
or
die
as
Prince
of
Winterfell.
But
I
will
not
command
any
man
to
die
with
me.
If
you
leave
now,
before
Ser
RodrikвЂ™s
main
force
is
upon
us,
thereвЂ™s
still
a
chance
you
may
win
free.вЂќ
He
unsheathed
his
longsword
and
drew
a
line
in
the
dirt.
вЂњThose
who
would
stay
and
fight,
step
forward.вЂќ

No
one
spoke.
The
men
stood
in
their
mail
and
fur
and
boiled
leather,
as
still
as
if
they
were
made
of
stone.
A
few
exchanged
looks.
Urzen
shuffled
his
feet.
Dykk
Harlaw
hawked
and
spat.
A
finger
of
wind
ruffled
EndeharвЂ™s
long
fair
hair.

Theon
felt
as
though
he
were
drowning.
Why
am
I
surprised?
he
thought
bleakly.
His
father
had
forsaken
him,
his
uncles,
his
sister,
even
that
wretched
creature
Reek.
Why
should
his
men
prove
any
more
loyal?
There
was
nothing
to
say,
nothing
to
do.
He
could
only
stand
there
beneath
the
great
grey
walls
and
the
hard
white
sky,
sword
in
hand,
waiting,
waitingвЂ¦

Wex
was
the
first
to
cross
the
line.
Three
quick
steps
and
he
stood
at
TheonвЂ™s
side,
slouching.
Shamed
by
the
boy,
Black
Lorren
followed,
all
scowls.
вЂњWho
else?вЂќ
he
demanded.
Red
Rolfe
came
forward.
Kromm.
Werlag.
Tymor
and
his
brothers.
Ulf
the
Ill.
Harrag
Sheepstealer.
Four
Harlaws
and
two
Botleys.
Kenned
the
Whale
was
the
last.
Seventeen
in
all.

Urzen
was
among
those
who
did
not
move,
and
Stygg,
and
every
man
of
the
ten
that
Asha
had
brought
from
Deepwood
Motte.
вЂњGo,
then,вЂќ
Theon
told
them.
вЂњRun
to
my
sister.
SheвЂ™ll
give
you
all
a
warm
welcome,
I
have
no
doubt.вЂќ

Stygg
had
the
grace
at
least
to
look
ashamed.
The
rest
moved
off
without
a
word.
Theon
turned
to
the
seventeen
who
remained.
вЂњBack
to
the
walls.
If
the
gods
should
spare
us,
I
shall
remember
every
man
of
you.вЂќ

Black
Lorren
stayed
when
the
others
had
gone.
вЂњThe
castle
folk
will
turn
on
us
soon
as
the
fight
begins.вЂќ

вЂњI
know
that.
What
would
you
have
me
do?вЂќ

вЂњPut
them
out,вЂќ
said
Lorren.
вЂњEvery
one.вЂќ

Theon
shook
his
head.
вЂњIs
the
noose
ready?вЂќ

вЂњIt
is.
You
mean
to
use
it?вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
know
a
better
way?вЂќ

вЂњAye.
IвЂ™ll
take
my
axe
and
stand
on
that
drawbridge,
and
let
them
come
try
me.
One
at
a
time,
two,
three,
it
makes
no
matter.
None
will
pass
the
moat
while
I
still
draw
breath.вЂќ

He
means
to
die,
thought
Theon.
ItвЂ™s
not
victory
he
wants,
itвЂ™s
an
end
worthy
of
a
song.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
use
the
noose.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say,вЂќ
Lorren
replied,
contempt
in
his
eyes.

Wex
helped
garb
him
for
battle.
Beneath
his
black
surcoat
and
golden
mantle
was
a
shirt
of
well-oiled
ringmail,
and
under
that
a
layer
of
stiff
boiled
leather.
Once
armed
and
armored,
Theon
climbed
the
watchtower
at
the
angle
where
the
eastern
and
southern
walls
came
together
to
have
a
look
at
his
doom.
The
northmen
were
spreading
out
to
encircle
the
castle.
It
was
hard
to
judge
their
numbers.
A
thousand
at
least;
perhaps
twice
that
many.
Against
seventeen.
TheyвЂ™d
brought
catapults
and
scorpions.
He
saw
no
siege
towers
rumbling
up
the
kingsroad,
but
there
was
timber
enough
in
the
wolfswood
to
build
as
many
as
were
required.

Theon
studied
their
banners
through
Maester
LuwinвЂ™s
Myrish
lens
tube.
The
Cerwyn
battle-axe
flapped
bravely
wherever
he
looked,
and
there
were
Tallhart
trees
as
well,
and
mermen
from
White
Harbor.
Less
common
were
the
sigils
of
Flint
and
Karstark.
Here
and
there
he
even
saw
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods.
But
no
Glovers,
Asha
saw
to
them,
no
Boltons
from
the
Dreadfort,
no
Umbers
come
down
from
the
shadow
of
the
Wall.
Not
that
they
were
needed.
Soon
enough
the
boy
Cley
Cerwyn
appeared
before
the
gates
carrying
a
peace
banner
on
a
tall
staff,
to
announce
that
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
wished
to
parley
with
Theon
Turncloak.

Turncloak.
The
name
was
bitter
as
bile.
He
had
gone
to
Pyke
to
lead
his
fatherвЂ™s
longships
against
Lannisport,
he
remembered.
вЂњI
shall
be
out
shortly,вЂќ
he
shouted
down.
вЂњAlone.вЂќ

Black
Lorren
disapproved.
вЂњOnly
blood
can
wash
out
blood,вЂќ
he
declared.
вЂњKnights
may
keep
their
truces
with
other
knights,
but
they
are
not
so
careful
of
their
honor
when
dealing
with
those
they
deem
outlaw.вЂќ

Theon
bristled.
вЂњI
am
the
Prince
of
Winterfell
and
heir
to
the
Iron
Islands.
Now
go
find
the
girl
and
do
as
I
told
you.вЂќ

Black
Lorren
gave
him
a
murderous
look.
вЂњAye,
Prince.вЂќ

HeвЂ™s
turned
against
me
too,
Theon
realized.
Of
late
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
very
stones
of
Winterfell
had
turned
against
him.
If
I
die,
I
die
friendless
and
abandoned.
What
choice
did
that
leave
him,
but
to
live?

He
rode
to
the
gatehouse
with
his
crown
on
his
head.
A
woman
was
drawing
water
from
the
well,
and
Gage
the
cook
stood
in
the
door
of
the
kitchens.
They
hid
their
hatred
behind
sullen
looks
and
faces
blank
as
slate,
yet
he
could
feel
it
all
the
same.

When
the
drawbridge
was
lowered,
a
chill
wind
sighed
across
the
moat.
The
touch
of
it
made
him
shiver.
It
is
the
cold,
nothing
more,
Theon
told
himself,
a
shiver,
not
a
tremble.
Even
brave
men
shiver.
Into
the
teeth
of
that
wind
he
rode,
under
the
portcullis,
over
the
drawbridge.
The
outer
gates
swung
open
to
let
him
pass.
As
he
emerged
beneath
the
walls,
he
could
sense
the
boys
watching
from
the
empty
sockets
where
their
eyes
had
been.

Ser
Rodrik
waited
in
the
market
astride
his
dappled
gelding.
Beside
him,
the
direwolf
of
Stark
flapped
from
a
staff
borne
by
young
Cley
Cerwyn.
They
were
alone
in
the
square,
though
Theon
could
see
archers
on
the
roofs
of
surrounding
houses,
spearmen
to
his
right,
and
to
his
left
a
line
of
mounted
knights
beneath
the
merman-and-trident
of
House
Manderly.
Every
one
of
them
wants
me
dead.
Some
were
boys
heвЂ™d
drunk
with,
diced
with,
even
wenched
with,
but
that
would
not
save
him
if
he
fell
into
their
hands.

вЂњSer
Rodrik.вЂќ
Theon
reined
to
a
halt.
вЂњIt
grieves
me
that
we
must
meet
as
foes.вЂќ

вЂњMy
own
grief
is
that
I
must
wait
a
while
to
hang
you.вЂќ
The
old
knight
spat
onto
the
muddy
ground.
вЂњTheon
Turncloak.вЂќ

вЂњI
am
a
Greyjoy
of
Pyke,вЂќ
Theon
reminded
him.
вЂњThe
cloak
my
father
swaddled
me
in
bore
a
kraken,
not
a
direwolf.вЂќ

вЂњFor
ten
years
you
have
been
a
ward
of
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњHostage
and
prisoner,
I
call
it.вЂќ

вЂњThen
perhaps
Lord
Eddard
should
have
kept
you
chained
to
a
dungeon
wall.
Instead
he
raised
you
among
his
own
sons,
the
sweet
boys
you
have
butchered,
and
to
my
undying
shame
I
trained
you
in
the
arts
of
war.
Would
that
I
had
thrust
a
sword
through
your
belly
instead
of
placing
one
in
your
hand.вЂќ

вЂњI
came
out
to
parley,
not
to
suffer
your
insults.
Say
what
you
have
to
say,
old
man.
What
would
you
have
of
me?вЂќ

вЂњTwo
things,вЂќ
the
old
man
said.
вЂњWinterfell,
and
your
life.
Command
your
men
to
open
the
gates
and
lay
down
their
arms.
Those
who
murdered
no
children
shall
be
free
to
walk
away,
but
you
shall
be
held
for
King
RobbвЂ™s
justice.
May
the
gods
take
pity
on
you
when
he
returns.вЂќ

вЂњRobb
will
never
look
on
Winterfell
again,вЂќ
Theon
promised.
вЂњHe
will
break
himself
on
Moat
Cailin,
as
every
southron
army
has
done
for
ten
thousand
years.
We
hold
the
north
now,
ser.вЂќ

вЂњYou
hold
three
castles,вЂќ
replied
Ser
Rodrik,
вЂњand
this
one
I
mean
to
take
back,
Turncloak.вЂќ

Theon
ignored
that.
вЂњHere
are
my
terms.
You
have
until
evenfall
to
disperse.
Those
who
swear
fealty
to
Balon
Greyjoy
as
their
king
and
to
myself
as
Prince
of
Winterfell
will
be
confirmed
in
their
rights
and
properties
and
suffer
no
harm.
Those
who
defy
us
will
be
destroyed.вЂќ

Young
Cerwyn
was
incredulous.
вЂњAre
you
mad,
Greyjoy?вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
shook
his
head.
вЂњOnly
vain,
lad.
Theon
has
always
had
too
lofty
an
opinion
of
himself,
I
fear.вЂќ
The
old
man
jabbed
a
finger
at
him.
вЂњDo
not
imagine
that
I
need
wait
for
Robb
to
fight
his
way
up
the
Neck
to
deal
with
the
likes
of
you.
I
have
near
two
thousand
men
with
meвЂ¦
and
if
the
tales
be
true,
you
have
no
more
than
fifty.вЂќ

Seventeen,
in
truth.
Theon
made
himself
smile.
вЂњI
have
something
better
than
men.вЂќ
And
he
raised
a
fist
over
his
head,
the
signal
Black
Lorren
had
been
told
to
watch
for.

The
walls
of
Winterfell
were
behind
him,
but
Ser
Rodrik
faced
them
squarely
and
could
not
fail
to
see.
Theon
watched
his
face.
When
his
chin
quivered
under
those
stiff
white
whiskers,
he
knew
just
what
the
old
man
was
seeing.
He
is
not
surprised,
he
thought
with
sadness,
but
the
fear
is
there.

вЂњThis
is
craven,вЂќ
Ser
Rodrik
said.
вЂњTo
use
a
child
soвЂ¦
this
is
despicable.вЂќ

вЂњOh,
I
know,вЂќ
said
Theon.
вЂњItвЂ™s
a
dish
I
tasted
myself,
or
have
you
forgotten?
I
was
ten
when
I
was
taken
from
my
fatherвЂ™s
house,
to
make
certain
he
would
raise
no
more
rebellions.вЂќ

вЂњIt
is
not
the
same!вЂќ

TheonвЂ™s
face
was
impassive.
вЂњThe
noose
I
wore
was
not
made
of
hempen
rope,
thatвЂ™s
true
enough,
but
I
felt
it
all
the
same.
And
it
chafed,
Ser
Rodrik.
It
chafed
me
raw.вЂќ
He
had
never
quite
realized
that
until
now,
but
as
the
words
came
spilling
out
he
saw
the
truth
of
them.

вЂњNo
harm
was
ever
done
you.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
no
harm
will
be
done
your
Beth,
so
long
as
youвЂ”вЂќ

Ser
Rodrik
never
gave
him
the
chance
to
finish.
вЂњViper,вЂќ
the
knight
declared,
his
face
red
with
rage
beneath
those
white
whiskers.
вЂњI
gave
you
the
chance
to
save
your
men
and
die
with
some
small
shred
of
honor,
Turncloak.
I
should
have
known
that
was
too
much
to
ask
of
a
childkiller.вЂќ
His
hand
went
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
вЂњI
ought
cut
you
down
here
and
now
and
put
an
end
to
your
lies
and
deceits.
By
the
gods,
I
should.вЂќ

Theon
did
not
fear
a
doddering
old
man,
but
those
watching
archers
and
that
line
of
knights
were
a
different
matter.
If
the
swords
came
out
his
chances
of
getting
back
to
the
castle
alive
were
small
to
none.
вЂњForswear
your
oath
and
murder
me,
and
you
will
watch
your
little
Beth
strangle
at
the
end
of
a
rope.вЂќ

Ser
RodrikвЂ™s
knuckles
had
gone
white,
but
after
a
moment
he
took
his
hand
off
the
swordhilt.
вЂњTruly,
I
have
lived
too
long.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
not
disagree,
ser.
Will
you
accept
my
terms?вЂќ

вЂњI
have
a
duty
to
Lady
Catelyn
and
House
Stark.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
your
own
House?
Beth
is
the
last
of
your
blood.вЂќ

The
old
knight
drew
himself
up
straight.
вЂњI
offer
myself
in
my
daughterвЂ™s
place.
Release
her,
and
take
me
as
your
hostage.
Surely
the
castellan
of
Winterfell
is
worth
more
than
a
child.вЂќ

вЂњNot
to
me.вЂќ
A
valiant
gesture,
old
man,
but
I
am
not
that
great
a
fool.
вЂњNot
to
Lord
Manderly
or
Leobald
Tallhart
either,
IвЂ™d
wager.вЂќ
Your
sorry
old
skin
is
worth
no
more
to
them
than
any
other
manвЂ™s.
вЂњNo,
IвЂ™ll
keep
the
girlвЂ¦
and
keep
her
safe,
so
long
as
you
do
as
IвЂ™ve
commanded
you.
Her
life
is
in
your
hands.вЂќ

вЂњGods
be
good,
Theon,
how
can
you
do
this?
You
know
I
must
attack,
have
swornвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњIf
this
host
is
still
in
arms
before
my
gate
when
the
sun
sets,
Beth
will
hang,вЂќ
said
Theon.
вЂњAnother
hostage
will
follow
her
to
the
grave
at
first
light,
and
another
at
sunset.
Every
dawn
and
every
dusk
will
mean
a
death,
until
you
are
gone.
I
have
no
lack
of
hostages.вЂќ
He
did
not
wait
for
a
reply,
but
wheeled
Smiler
around
and
rode
back
toward
the
castle.
He
went
slowly
at
first,
but
the
thought
of
those
archers
at
his
back
soon
drove
him
to
a
canter.
The
small
heads
watched
him
come
from
their
spikes,
their
tarred
and
flayed
faces
looming
larger
with
every
yard;
between
them
stood
little
Beth
Cassel,
noosed
and
crying.
Theon
put
his
heel
into
Smiler
and
broke
into
a
hard
gallop.
SmilerвЂ™s
hooves
clattered
on
the
drawbridge,
like
drumbeats.

In
the
yard
he
dismounted
and
handed
his
reins
to
Wex.
вЂњIt
may
stay
them,вЂќ
he
told
Black
Lorren.
вЂњWeвЂ™ll
know
by
sunset.
Take
the
girl
in
till
then,
and
keep
her
somewhere
safe.вЂќ
Under
the
layers
of
leather,
steel,
and
wool,
he
was
slick
with
sweat.
вЂњI
need
a
cup
of
wine.
A
vat
of
wine
would
do
even
better.вЂќ

A
fire
had
been
laid
in
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
bedchamber.
Theon
sat
beside
it
and
filled
a
cup
with
a
heavy-bodied
red
from
the
castle
vaults,
a
wine
as
sour
as
his
mood.
They
will
attack,
he
thought
gloomily,
staring
at
the
flames.
Ser
Rodrik
loves
his
daughter,
but
he
is
still
castellan,
and
most
of
all
a
knight.
Had
it
been
Theon
with
a
noose
around
his
neck
and
Lord
Balon
commanding
the
army
without,
the
warhorns
would
already
have
sounded
the
attack,
he
had
no
doubt.
He
should
thank
the
gods
that
Ser
Rodrik
was
not
ironborn.
The
men
of
the
green
lands
were
made
of
softer
stuff,
though
he
was
not
certain
they
would
prove
soft
enough.

If
not,
if
the
old
man
gave
the
command
to
storm
the
castle
regardless,
Winterfell
would
fall;
Theon
entertained
no
delusions
on
that
count.
His
seventeen
might
kill
three,
four,
five
times
their
own
number,
but
in
the
end
they
would
be
overwhelmed.

Theon
stared
at
the
flames
over
the
rim
of
his
wine
goblet,
brooding
on
the
injustice
of
it
all.
вЂњI
rode
beside
Robb
Stark
in
the
Whispering
Wood,вЂќ
he
muttered.
He
had
been
frightened
that
night,
but
not
like
this.
It
was
one
thing
to
go
into
battle
surrounded
by
friends,
and
another
to
perish
alone
and
despised.
Mercy,
he
thought
miserably.

When
the
wine
brought
no
solace,
Theon
sent
Wex
to
fetch
his
bow
and
took
himself
to
the
old
inner
ward.
There
he
stood,
loosing
shaft
after
shaft
at
the
archery
butts
until
his
shoulders
ached
and
his
fingers
were
bloody,
pausing
only
long
enough
to
pull
the
arrows
from
the
targets
for
another
round.
I
saved
BranвЂ™s
life
with
this
bow,
he
reminded
himself.
Would
that
I
could
save
my
own.
Women
came
to
the
well,
but
did
not
linger;
whatever
they
saw
on
TheonвЂ™s
face
sent
them
away
quickly.

Behind
him
the
broken
tower
stood,
its
summit
as
jagged
as
a
crown
where
fire
had
collapsed
the
upper
stories
long
ago.
As
the
sun
moved,
the
shadow
of
the
tower
moved
as
well,
gradually
lengthening,
a
black
arm
reaching
out
for
Theon
Greyjoy.
By
the
time
the
sun
touched
the
wall,
he
was
in
its
grasp.
If
I
hang
the
girl,
the
northmen
will
attack
at
once,
he
thought
as
he
loosed
a
shaft.
If
I
do
not
hang
her,
they
will
know
my
threats
are
empty.
He
knocked
another
arrow
to
his
bow.
There
is
no
way
out,
none.

вЂњIf
you
had
a
hundred
archers
as
good
as
yourself,
you
might
have
a
chance
to
hold
the
castle,вЂќ
a
voice
said
softly.

When
he
turned,
Maester
Luwin
was
behind
him.
вЂњGo
away,вЂќ
Theon
told
him.
вЂњI
have
had
enough
of
your
counsel.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
life?
Have
you
had
enough
of
that,
my
lord
prince?вЂќ

He
raised
the
bow.
вЂњOne
more
word
and
IвЂ™ll
put
this
shaft
through
your
heart.вЂќ

вЂњYou
wonвЂ™t.вЂќ

Theon
bent
the
bow,
drawing
the
grey
goose
feathers
back
to
his
cheek.
вЂњCare
to
make
a
wager?вЂќ

вЂњI
am
your
last
hope,
Theon.вЂќ

I
have
no
hope,
he
thought.
Yet
he
lowered
the
bow
half
an
inch
and
said,
вЂњI
will
not
run.вЂќ

вЂњI
do
not
speak
of
running.
Take
the
black.вЂќ

вЂњThe
NightвЂ™s
Watch?вЂќ
Theon
let
the
bow
unbend
slowly
and
pointed
the
arrow
at
the
ground.

вЂњSer
Rodrik
has
served
House
Stark
all
his
life,
and
House
Stark
has
always
been
a
friend
to
the
Watch.
He
will
not
deny
you.
Open
your
gates,
lay
down
your
arms,
accept
his
terms,
and
he
must
let
you
take
the
black.вЂќ

A
brother
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.
It
meant
no
crown,
no
sons,
no
wifeвЂ¦
but
it
meant
life,
and
life
with
honor.
Ned
StarkвЂ™s
own
brother
had
chosen
the
Watch,
and
Jon
Snow
as
well.

I
have
black
garb
aplenty,
once
I
tear
the
krakens
off.
Even
my
horse
is
black.
I
could
rise
high
in
the
WatchвЂ”chief
of
rangers,
likely
even
Lord
Commander.
Let
Asha
keep
the
bloody
islands,
theyвЂ™re
as
dreary
as
she
is.
If
I
served
at
Eastwatch,
I
could
command
my
own
ship,
and
thereвЂ™s
fine
hunting
beyond
the
Wall.
As
for
women,
what
wildling
woman
wouldnвЂ™t
want
a
prince
in
her
bed?
A
slow
smile
crept
across
his
face,
A
black
cloak
canвЂ™t
be
turned.
IвЂ™d
be
as
good
as
any
manвЂ¦

вЂњPRINCE
THEON!вЂќ
The
sudden
shout
shattered
his
daydream.
Kromm
was
loping
across
the
ward.
вЂњThe
northmenвЂ”вЂќ

He
felt
a
sudden
sick
sense
of
dread.
вЂњIs
it
the
attack?вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
clutched
his
arm.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
still
time.
Raise
a
peace
bannerвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњTheyвЂ™re
fighting,вЂќ
Kromm
said
urgently.
вЂњMore
men
came
up,
hundreds
of
them,
and
at
first
they
made
to
join
the
others.
But
now
theyвЂ™ve
fallen
on
them!вЂќ

вЂњIs
it
Asha?вЂќ
Had
she
come
to
save
him
after
all?

But
Kromm
gave
a
shake
of
his
head.
вЂњNo.
These
are
northmen,
I
tell
you.
With
a
bloody
man
on
their
banner.вЂќ

The
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort.
Reek
had
belonged
to
the
Bastard
of
Bolton
before
his
capture,
Theon
recalled.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
a
vile
creature
like
him
could
sway
the
Boltons
to
change
their
allegiance,
but
nothing
else
made
sense.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
see
this
for
myself,вЂќ
Theon
said.

Maester
Luwin
trailed
after
him.
By
the
time
they
reached
the
battlements,
dead
men
and
dying
horses
were
strewn
about
the
market
square
outside
the
gates.
He
saw
no
battle
lines,
only
a
swirling
chaos
of
banners
and
blades.
Shouts
and
screams
rang
through
the
cold
autumn
air.
Ser
Rodrik
seemed
to
have
the
numbers,
but
the
Dreadfort
men
were
better
led,
and
had
taken
the
others
unawares.
Theon
watched
them
charge
and
wheel
and
charge
again,
chopping
the
larger
force
to
bloody
pieces
every
time
they
tried
to
form
up
between
the
houses.
He
could
hear
the
crash
of
iron
axeheads
on
oaken
shields
over
the
terrified
trumpeting
of
a
maimed
horse.
The
inn
was
burning,
he
saw.

Black
Lorren
appeared
beside
him
and
stood
silently
for
a
time.
The
sun
was
low
in
the
west,
painting
the
fields
and
houses
all
a
glowing
red.
A
thin
wavering
cry
of
pain
drifted
over
the
walls,
and
a
warhorn
sounded
off
beyond
the
burning
houses.
Theon
watched
a
wounded
man
drag
himself
painfully
across
the
ground,
smearing
his
lifeвЂ™s
blood
in
the
dirt
as
he
struggled
to
reach
the
well
that
stood
at
the
center
of
the
market
square.
He
died
before
he
got
there.
He
wore
a
leather
jerkin
and
conical
halfhelm,
but
no
badge
to
tell
which
side
heвЂ™d
fought
on.

The
crows
came
in
the
blue
dust,
with
the
evening
stars.
вЂњThe
Dothraki
believe
the
stars
are
spirits
of
the
valiant
dead,вЂќ
Theon
said.
Maester
Luwin
had
told
him
that,
a
long
time
ago.

вЂњDothraki?вЂќ

вЂњThe
horselords
across
the
narrow
sea.вЂќ

вЂњOh.
Them.вЂќ
Black
Lorren
frowned
through
his
beard.
вЂњSavages
believe
all
manner
of
foolish
things.вЂќ

As
the
night
grew
darker
and
the
smoke
spread
it
was
harder
to
make
out
what
was
happening
below,
but
the
din
of
steel
gradually
diminished
to
nothing,
and
the
shouts
and
warhorns
gave
way
to
moans
and
piteous
wailing.
Finally
a
column
of
mounted
men
rode
out
of
the
drifting
smoke.
At
their
head
was
a
knight
in
dark
armor.
His
rounded
helm
gleamed
a
sullen
red,
and
a
pale
pink
cloak
streamed
from
his
shoulders.
Outside
the
main
gate
he
reined
up,
and
one
of
his
men
shouted
for
the
castle
to
open.

вЂњAre
you
friend
or
foe?вЂќ
Black
Lorren
bellowed
down.

вЂњWould
a
foe
bring
such
fine
gifts?вЂќ
Red
Helm
waved
a
hand,
and
three
corpses
were
dumped
in
front
of
the
gates.
A
torch
was
waved
above
the
bodies,
so
the
defenders
upon
the
walls
might
see
the
faces
of
the
dead.

вЂњThe
old
castellan,вЂќ
said
Black
Lorren.

вЂњWith
Leobald
Tallhart
and
Cley
Cerwyn.вЂќ
The
boy
lord
had
taken
an
arrow
in
the
eye,
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
lost
his
left
arm
at
the
elbow.
Maester
Luwin
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
dismay,
turned
away
from
the
battlements,
and
fell
to
his
knees
sick.

вЂњThe
great
pig
Manderly
was
too
craven
to
leave
White
Harbor,
or
we
would
have
brought
him
as
well,вЂќ
shouted
Red
Helm.

I
am
saved,
Theon
thought.
So
why
did
he
feel
so
empty?
This
was
victory,
sweet
victory,
the
deliverance
he
had
prayed
for.
He
glanced
at
Maester
Luwin.
To
think
how
close
I
came
to
yielding,
and
taking
the
blackвЂ¦

вЂњOpen
the
gates
for
our
friends.вЂќ
Perhaps
tonight
Theon
would
sleep
without
fear
of
what
his
dreams
might
bring.

The
Dreadfort
men
made
their
way
across
the
moat
and
through
the
inner
gates.
Theon
descended
with
Black
Lorren
and
Maester
Luwin
to
meet
them
in
the
yard.
Pale
red
pennons
trailed
from
the
ends
of
a
few
lances,
but
many
more
carried
battle-axes
and
greatswords
and
shields
hacked
half
to
splinters.
вЂњHow
many
men
did
you
lose?вЂќ
Theon
asked
Red
Helm
as
he
dismounted.

вЂњTwenty
or
thirty.вЂќ
The
torchlight
glittered
off
the
chipped
enamel
of
his
visor.
His
helm
and
gorget
were
wrought
in
the
shape
of
a
manвЂ™s
face
and
shoulders,
skinless
and
bloody,
mouth
open
in
a
silent
howl
of
anguish.

вЂњSer
Rodrik
had
you
five-to-one.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
but
he
thought
us
friends.
A
common
mistake.
When
the
old
fool
gave
me
his
hand,
I
took
half
his
arm
instead.
Then
I
let
him
see
my
face.вЂќ
The
man
put
both
hands
to
his
helm
and
lifted
it
off
his
head,
holding
it
in
the
crook
of
his
arm.

вЂњReek,вЂќ
Theon
said,
disquieted.
How
did
a
serving
man
get
such
fine
armor?

The
man
laughed.
вЂњThe
wretch
is
dead.вЂќ
He
stepped
closer.
вЂњThe
girlвЂ™s
fault.
If
she
had
not
run
so
far,
his
horse
would
not
have
lamed,
and
we
might
have
been
able
to
flee.
I
gave
him
mine
when
I
saw
the
riders
from
the
ridge.
I
was
done
with
her
by
then,
and
he
liked
to
take
his
turn
while
they
were
still
warm.
I
had
to
pull
him
off
her
and
shove
my
clothes
into
his
handsвЂ”calfskin
boots
and
velvet
doublet,
silver-chased
swordbelt,
even
my
sable
cloak.
Ride
for
the
Dreadfort,
I
told
him,
bring
all
the
help
you
can.
Take
my
horse,
heвЂ™s
swifter,
and
here,
wear
the
ring
my
father
gave
me,
so
theyвЂ™ll
know
you
came
from
me.
HeвЂ™d
learned
better
than
to
question
me.
By
the
time
they
put
that
arrow
through
his
back,
IвЂ™d
smeared
myself
with
the
girlвЂ™s
filth
and
dressed
in
his
rags.
They
might
have
hanged
me
anyway,
but
it
was
the
only
chance
I
saw.вЂќ
He
rubbed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
mouth.
вЂњAnd
now,
my
sweet
prince,
there
was
a
woman
promised
me,
if
I
brought
two
hundred
men.
Well,
I
brought
three
times
as
many,
and
no
green
boys
nor
fieldhands
neither,
but
my
fatherвЂ™s
own
garrison.вЂќ

Theon
had
given
his
word.
This
was
not
the
time
to
flinch.
Pay
him
his
pound
of
flesh
and
deal
with
him
later.
вЂњHarrag,вЂќ
he
said,
вЂњgo
to
the
kennels
and
bring
Palla
out
forвЂ¦?вЂќ

вЂњRamsay.вЂќ
There
was
a
smile
on
his
plump
lips,
but
none
in
those
pale
pale
eyes.
вЂњSnow,
my
wife
called
me
before
she
ate
her
fingers,
but
I
say
Bolton.вЂќ
His
smile
curdled.
вЂњSo
youвЂ™d
offer
me
a
kennel
girl
for
my
good
service,
is
that
the
way
of
it?вЂќ

There
was
a
tone
in
his
voice
Theon
did
not
like,
no
more
than
he
liked
the
insolent
way
the
Dreadfort
men
were
looking
at
him.
вЂњShe
was
what
was
promised.вЂќ

вЂњShe
smells
of
dogshit.
IвЂ™ve
had
enough
of
bad
smells,
as
it
happens.
I
think
IвЂ™ll
have
your
bedwarmer
instead.
What
do
you
call
her?
Kyra?вЂќ

вЂњAre
you
mad?вЂќ
Theon
said
angrily.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
have
youвЂ”вЂќ

The
BastardвЂ™s
backhand
caught
him
square,
and
his
cheekbone
shattered
with
a
sickening
crunch
beneath
the
lobstered
steel.
The
world
vanished
in
a
red
roar
of
pain.

Sometime
later,
Theon
found
himself
on
the
ground.
He
rolled
onto
his
stomach
and
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
blood.
Close
the
gates!
he
tried
to
shout,
but
it
was
too
late.
The
Dreadfort
men
had
cut
down
Red
Rolfe
and
Kenned,
and
more
were
pouring
through,
a
river
of
mail
and
sharp
swords.
There
was
a
ringing
in
his
ears,
and
horror
all
around
him.
Black
Lorren
had
his
sword
out,
but
there
were
already
four
of
them
pressing
in
on
him.
He
saw
Ulf
go
down
with
a
crossbow
bolt
through
the
belly
as
he
ran
for
the
Great
Hall.
Maester
Luwin
was
trying
to
reach
him
when
a
knight
on
a
warhorse
planted
a
spear
between
his
shoulders,
then
swung
back
to
ride
over
him.
Another
man
whipped
a
torch
round
and
round
his
head
and
then
lofted
it
toward
the
thatched
roof
of
the
stables.
вЂњSave
me
the
Freys,вЂќ
the
Bastard
was
shouting
as
the
flames
roared
upward,
вЂњand
burn
the
rest.
Burn
it,
burn
it
all.вЂќ

The
last
thing
Theon
Greyjoy
saw
was
Smiler,
kicking
free
of
the
burning
stables
with
his
mane
ablaze,
screaming,
rearingвЂ¦





TYRION

He
dreamed
of
a
cracked
stone
ceiling
and
the
smells
of
blood
and
shit
and
burnt
flesh.
The
air
was
full
of
acrid
smoke.
Men
were
groaning
and
whimpering
all
around
him,
and
from
time
to
time
a
scream
would
pierce
the
air,
thick
with
pain.
When
he
tried
to
move,
he
found
that
he
had
fouled
his
own
bedding.
The
smoke
in
the
air
made
his
eyes
water.
Am
I
crying?
He
must
not
let
his
father
see.
He
was
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock.
A
lion,
I
must
be
a
lion,
live
a
lion,
die
a
lion.
He
hurt
so
much,
though.
Too
weak
to
groan,
he
lay
in
his
own
filth
and
shut
his
eyes.
Nearby
someone
was
cursing
the
gods
in
a
heavy,
monotonous
voice.
He
listened
to
the
blasphemies
and
wondered
if
he
was
dying.
After
a
time
the
room
faded.

He
found
himself
outside
the
city,
walking
through
a
world
without
color.
Ravens
soared
through
a
grey
sky
on
wide
black
wings,
while
carrion
crows
rose
from
their
feasts
in
furious
clouds
wherever
he
set
his
steps.
White
maggots
burrowed
through
black
corruption.
The
wolves
were
grey,
and
so
were
the
silent
sisters;
together
they
stripped
the
flesh
from
the
fallen.
There
were
corpses
strewn
all
over
the
tourney
fields.
The
sun
was
a
hot
white
penny,
shining
down
upon
the
grey
river
as
it
rushed
around
the
charred
bones
of
sunken
ships.
From
the
pyres
of
the
dead
rose
black
columns
of
smoke
and
white-hot
ashes.
My
work,
thought
Tyrion
Lannister.
They
died
at
my
command.

At
first
there
was
no
sound
in
the
world,
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
dead,
soft
and
terrible.
They
wept
and
moaned,
they
begged
for
an
end
to
pain,
they
cried
for
help
and
wanted
their
mothers.
Tyrion
had
never
known
his
mother.
He
wanted
Shae,
but
she
was
not
there.
He
walked
alone
amidst
grey
shadows,
trying
to
rememberвЂ¦

The
silent
sisters
were
stripping
the
dead
men
of
their
armor
and
clothes.
All
the
bright
dyes
had
leached
out
from
the
surcoats
of
the
slain;
they
were
garbed
in
shades
of
white
and
grey,
and
their
blood
was
black
and
crusty.
He
watched
their
naked
bodies
lifted
by
arm
and
leg,
to
be
carried
swinging
to
the
pyres
to
join
their
fellows.
Metal
and
cloth
were
thrown
in
the
back
of
a
white
wooden
wagon,
pulled
by
two
tall
black
horses.

So
many
dead,
so
very
many.
Their
corpses
hung
limply,
their
faces
slack
or
stiff
or
swollen
with
gas,
unrecognizable,
hardly
human.
The
garments
the
sisters
took
from
them
were
decorated
with
black
hearts,
grey
lions,
dead
flowers,
and
pale
ghostly
stags.
Their
armor
was
all
dented
and
gashed,
the
chainmail
riven,
broken,
slashed.
Why
did
I
kill
them
all?
He
had
known
once,
but
somehow
he
had
forgotten.

He
would
have
asked
one
of
the
silent
sisters,
but
when
he
tried
to
speak
he
found
he
had
no
mouth.
Smooth
seamless
skin
covered
his
teeth.
The
discovery
terrified
him.
How
could
he
live
without
a
mouth?
He
began
to
run.
The
city
was
not
far.
He
would
be
safe
inside
the
city,
away
from
all
these
dead.
He
did
not
belong
with
the
dead.
He
had
no
mouth,
but
he
was
still
a
living
man.
No,
a
lion,
a
lion,
and
alive.
But
when
he
reached
the
city
walls,
the
gates
were
shut
against
him.

It
was
dark
when
he
woke
again.
At
first
he
could
see
nothing,
but
after
a
time
the
vague
outlines
of
a
bed
appeared
around
him.
The
drapes
were
drawn,
but
he
could
see
the
shape
of
carved
bedposts,
and
the
droop
of
the
velvet
canopy
over
his
head.
Under
him
was
the
yielding
softness
of
a
featherbed,
and
the
pillow
beneath
his
head
was
goose
down.
My
own
bed,
I
am
in
my
own
bed,
in
my
own
bedchamber.

It
was
warm
inside
the
drapes,
under
the
great
heap
of
furs
and
blankets
that
covered
him.
He
was
sweating.
Fever,
he
thought
groggily.
He
felt
so
weak,
and
the
pain
stabbed
through
him
when
he
struggled
to
lift
his
hand.
He
gave
up
the
effort.
His
head
felt
enormous,
as
big
as
the
bed,
too
heavy
to
raise
from
the
pillow.
His
body
he
could
scarcely
feel
at
all.
How
did
I
come
here?
He
tried
to
remember.
The
battle
came
back
in
fits
and
flashes.
The
fight
along
the
river,
the
knight
whoвЂ™d
offered
up
his
gauntlet,
the
bridge
of
shipsвЂ¦

Ser
Mandon.
He
saw
the
dead
empty
eyes,
the
reaching
hand,
the
green
fire
shining
against
the
white
enamel
plate.
Fear
swept
over
him
in
a
cold
rush;
beneath
the
sheets
he
could
feel
his
bladder
letting
go.
He
would
have
cried
out,
if
heвЂ™d
had
a
mouth.
No,
that
was
the
dream,
he
thought,
his
head
pounding.
Help
me,
someone
help
me.
Jaime,
Shae,
Mother,
someoneвЂ¦
TyshaвЂ¦

No
one
heard.
No
one
came.
Alone
in
the
dark,
he
fell
back
into
piss-scented
sleep.
He
dreamed
his
sister
was
standing
over
his
bed,
with
their
lord
father
beside
her,
frowning.
It
had
to
be
a
dream,
since
Lord
Tywin
was
a
thousand
leagues
away,
fighting
Robb
Stark
in
the
west.
Others
came
and
went
as
well.
Varys
looked
down
on
him
and
sighed,
but
Littlefinger
made
a
quip.
Bloody
treacherous
bastard,
Tyrion
thought
venomously,
we
sent
you
to
Bitterbridge
and
you
never
came
back.
Sometimes
he
could
hear
them
talking
to
one
another,
but
he
did
not
understand
the
words.
Their
voices
buzzed
in
his
ears
like
wasps
muffled
in
thick
felt.

He
wanted
to
ask
if
theyвЂ™d
won
the
battle.
We
must
have,
else
IвЂ™d
be
a
head
on
a
spike
somewhere.
If
I
live,
we
won.
He
did
not
know
what
pleased
him
more:
the
victory,
or
the
fact
he
had
been
able
to
reason
it
out.
His
wits
were
coming
back
to
him,
however
slowly.
That
was
good.
His
wits
were
all
he
had.

The
next
time
he
woke,
the
draperies
had
been
pulled
back,
and
Podrick
Payne
stood
over
him
with
a
candle.
When
he
saw
Tyrion
open
his
eyes
he
ran
off.
No,
donвЂ™t
go,
help
me,
help,
he
tried
to
call,
but
the
best
he
could
do
was
a
muffled
moan.
I
have
no
mouth.
He
raised
a
hand
to
his
face,
his
every
movement
pained
and
fumbling.
His
fingers
found
stiff
cloth
where
they
should
have
found
flesh,
lips,
teeth.
Linen.
The
lower
half
of
his
face
was
bandaged
tightly,
a
mask
of
hardened
plaster
with
holes
for
breathing
and
feeding.

A
short
while
later
Pod
reappeared.
This
time
a
stranger
was
with
him,
a
maester
chained
and
robed.
вЂњMy
lord,
you
must
be
still,вЂќ
the
man
murmured.
вЂњYou
are
grievous
hurt.
You
will
do
yourself
great
injury.
Are
you
thirsty?вЂќ

He
managed
an
awkward
nod.
The
maester
inserted
a
curved
copper
funnel
through
the
feeding
hole
over
his
mouth
and
poured
a
slow
trickle
down
his
throat.
Tyrion
swallowed,
scarcely
tasting.
Too
late
he
realized
the
liquid
was
milk
of
the
poppy.
By
the
time
the
maester
removed
the
funnel
from
his
mouth,
he
was
already
spiraling
back
to
sleep.

This
time
he
dreamed
he
was
at
a
feast,
a
victory
feast
in
some
great
hall.
He
had
a
high
seat
on
the
dais,
and
men
were
lifting
their
goblets
and
hailing
him
as
hero.
Marillion
was
there,
the
singer
whoвЂ™d
journeyed
with
them
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
He
played
his
woodharp
and
sang
of
the
ImpвЂ™s
daring
deeds.
Even
his
father
was
smiling
with
approval.
When
the
song
was
over,
Jaime
rose
from
his
place,
commanded
Tyrion
to
kneel,
and
touched
him
first
on
one
shoulder
and
then
on
the
other
with
his
golden
sword,
and
he
rose
up
a
knight.
Shae
was
waiting
to
embrace
him.
She
took
him
by
the
hand,
laughing
and
teasing,
calling
him
her
giant
of
Lannister.

He
woke
in
darkness
to
a
cold
empty
room.
The
draperies
had
been
drawn
again.
Something
felt
wrong,
turned
around,
though
he
could
not
have
said
what.
He
was
alone
once
more.
Pushing
back
the
blankets,
he
tried
to
sit,
but
the
pain
was
too
much
and
he
soon
subsided,
breathing
raggedly.
His
face
was
the
least
part
of
it.
His
right
side
was
one
huge
ache,
and
a
stab
of
pain
went
through
his
chest
whenever
he
lifted
his
arm.
WhatвЂ™s
happened
to
me?
Even
the
battle
seemed
half
a
dream
when
he
tried
to
think
back
on
it.
I
was
hurt
more
badly
than
I
knew.
Ser
MandonвЂ¦

The
memory
frightened
him,
but
Tyrion
made
himself
hold
it,
turn
it
in
his
head,
stare
at
it
hard.
He
tried
to
kill
me,
no
mistake.
That
part
was
not
a
dream.
He
would
have
cut
me
in
half
if
Pod
had
notвЂ¦
Pod,
whereвЂ™s
Pod?

Gritting
his
teeth,
he
grabbed
hold
of
the
bed
hangings
and
yanked.
The
drapes
ripped
free
of
the
canopy
overhead
and
tumbled
down,
half
on
the
rushes
and
half
on
him.
Even
that
small
effort
had
dizzied
him.
The
room
whirled
around
him,
all
bare
walls
and
dark
shadows,
with
a
single
narrow
window.
He
saw
a
chest
heвЂ™d
owned,
an
untidy
pile
of
his
clothing,
his
battered
armor.
This
is
not
my
bedchamber,
he
realized.
Not
even
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
Someone
had
moved
him.
His
shout
of
anger
came
out
as
a
muffled
moan.
They
have
moved
me
here
to
die,
he
thought
as
he
gave
up
the
struggle
and
closed
his
eyes
once
more.
The
room
was
dank
and
cold,
and
he
was
burning.

He
dreamed
of
a
better
place,
a
snug
little
cottage
by
the
sunset
sea.
The
walls
were
lopsided
and
cracked
and
the
floor
had
been
made
of
packed
earth,
but
he
had
always
been
warm
there,
even
when
they
let
the
fire
go
out.
She
used
to
tease
me
about
that,
he
remembered.
I
never
thought
to
feed
the
fire,
that
had
always
been
a
servantвЂ™s
task.
вЂњWe
have
no
servants,вЂќ
she
would
remind
me,
and
I
would
say,
вЂњYou
have
me,
IвЂ™m
your
servant,вЂќ
and
she
would
say,
вЂњA
lazy
servant.
What
do
they
do
with
lazy
servants
in
Casterly
Rock,
my
lord?вЂќ
and
he
would
tell
her,
вЂњThey
kiss
them.вЂќ
That
would
always
make
her
giggle.
вЂњThey
do
not
neither.
They
beat
them,
I
bet,вЂќ
she
would
say,
but
he
would
insist,
вЂњNo,
they
kiss
them,
just
like
this.вЂќ
He
would
show
her
how.
вЂњThey
kiss
their
fingers
first,
every
one,
and
they
kiss
their
wrists,
yes,
and
inside
their
elbows.
Then
they
kiss
their
funny
ears,
all
our
servants
have
funny
ears.
Stop
laughing!
And
they
kiss
their
cheeks
and
they
kiss
their
noses
with
the
little
bump
in
them,
there,
so,
like
that,
and
they
kiss
their
sweet
brows
and
their
hair
and
their
lips,
theirвЂ¦
mmmmвЂ¦
mouthsвЂ¦
soвЂ¦вЂќ

They
would
kiss
for
hours,
and
spend
whole
days
doing
no
more
than
lolling
in
bed,
listening
to
the
waves,
and
touching
each
other.
Her
body
was
a
wonder
to
him,
and
she
seemed
to
find
delight
in
his.
Sometimes
she
would
sing
to
him.
I
loved
a
maid
as
fair
as
summer,
with
sunlight
in
her
hair.
вЂњI
love
you,
Tyrion,вЂќ
she
would
whisper
before
they
went
to
sleep
at
night.
вЂњI
love
your
lips.
I
love
your
voice,
and
the
words
you
say
to
me,
and
how
you
treat
me
gentle.
I
love
your
face.вЂќ

вЂњMy
face?вЂќ

вЂњYes.
Yes.
I
love
your
hands,
and
how
you
touch
me.
Your
cock,
I
love
your
cock,
I
love
how
it
feels
when
itвЂ™s
in
me.вЂќ

вЂњIt
loves
you
too,
my
lady.вЂќ

вЂњI
love
to
say
your
name.
Tyrion
Lannister.
It
goes
with
mine.
Not
the
Lannister,
tвЂ™other
part.
Tyrion
and
Tysha.
Tysha
and
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
My
lord
TyrionвЂ¦вЂќ

Lies,
he
thought,
all
feigned,
all
for
gold,
she
was
a
whore,
JaimeвЂ™s
whore,
JaimeвЂ™s
gift,
my
lady
of
the
lie.
Her
face
seemed
to
fade
away,
dissolving
behind
a
veil
of
tears,
but
even
after
she
was
gone
he
could
still
hear
the
faint,
far-off
sound
of
her
voice,
calling
his
name.
вЂњвЂ¦my
lord,
can
you
hear
me?
My
lord?
Tyrion?
My
lord?
My
lord?вЂќ

Through
a
haze
of
poppied
sleep,
he
saw
a
soft
pink
face
leaning
over
him.
He
was
back
in
the
dank
room
with
the
torn
bed
hangings,
and
the
face
was
wrong,
not
hers,
too
round,
with
a
brown
fringe
of
beard.
вЂњDo
you
thirst,
my
lord?
I
have
your
milk,
your
good
milk.
You
must
not
fight,
no,
donвЂ™t
try
to
move,
you
need
your
rest.вЂќ
He
had
the
copper
funnel
in
one
damp
pink
hand
and
a
flask
in
the
other.

As
the
man
leaned
close,
TyrionвЂ™s
fingers
slid
underneath
his
chain
of
many
metals,
grabbed,
pulled.
The
maester
dropped
the
flask,
spilling
milk
of
the
poppy
all
over
the
blanket.
Tyrion
twisted
until
he
could
feel
the
links
digging
into
the
flesh
of
the
manвЂ™s
fat
neck.
вЂњNo.
More,вЂќ
he
croaked,
so
hoarse
he
was
not
certain
he
had
even
spoken.
But
he
must
have,
for
the
maester
choked
out
a
reply.
вЂњUnhand,
please,
my
lordвЂ¦
need
your
milk,
the
painвЂ¦
the
chain,
donвЂ™t,
unhand,
noвЂ¦вЂќ

The
pink
face
was
beginning
to
purple
when
Tyrion
let
go.
The
maester
reeled
back,
sucking
in
air.
His
reddened
throat
showed
deep
white
gouges
where
the
links
had
pressed.
His
eyes
were
white
too.
Tyrion
raised
a
hand
to
his
face
and
made
a
ripping
motion
over
the
hardened
mask.
And
again.
And
again.

вЂњYouвЂ¦
you
want
the
bandages
off,
is
that
it?вЂќ
the
maester
said
at
last.
вЂњBut
IвЂ™m
not
toвЂ¦
that
would
beвЂ¦
be
most
unwise,
my
lord.
You
are
not
yet
healed,
the
queen
wouldвЂ¦вЂќ

The
mention
of
his
sister
made
Tyrion
growl.
Are
you
one
of
hers,
then?
He
pointed
a
finger
at
the
maester,
then
coiled
his
hand
into
a
fist.
Crushing,
choking,
a
promise,
unless
the
fool
did
as
he
was
bid.

Thankfully,
he
understood.
вЂњIвЂ¦
I
will
do
as
my
lord
commands,
to
be
sure,
butвЂ¦
this
is
unwise,
your
woundsвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњDo.
It.вЂќ
Louder
that
time.

Bowing,
the
man
left
the
room,
only
to
return
a
few
moments
later,
bearing
a
long
knife
with
a
slender
sawtooth
blade,
a
basin
of
water,
a
pile
of
soft
cloths,
and
several
flasks.
By
then
Tyrion
had
managed
to
squirm
backward
a
few
inches,
so
he
was
half
sitting
against
his
pillow.
The
maester
bade
him
be
very
still
as
he
slid
the
tip
of
the
knife
in
under
his
chin,
beneath
the
mask.
A
slip
of
the
hand
here,
and
Cersei
will
be
free
of
me,
he
thought.
He
could
feel
the
blade
sawing
through
the
stiffened
linen,
only
inches
above
his
throat.

Fortunately
this
soft
pink
man
was
not
one
of
his
sisterвЂ™s
braver
creatures.
After
a
moment
he
felt
cool
air
on
his
cheeks.
There
was
pain
as
well,
but
he
did
his
best
to
ignore
that.
The
maester
discarded
the
bandages,
still
crusty
with
potion.
вЂњBe
still
now,
I
must
wash
out
the
wound.вЂќ
His
touch
was
gentle,
the
water
warm
and
soothing.
The
wound,
Tyrion
thought,
remembering
a
sudden
flash
of
bright
silver
that
seemed
to
pass
just
below
his
eyes.
вЂњThis
is
like
to
sting
some,вЂќ
the
maester
warned
as
he
wet
a
cloth
with
wine
that
smelled
of
crushed
herbs.
It
did
more
than
sting.
It
traced
a
line
of
fire
all
the
way
across
TyrionвЂ™s
face,
and
twisted
a
burning
poker
up
his
nose.
His
fingers
clawed
the
bedclothes
and
he
sucked
in
his
breath,
but
somehow
he
managed
not
to
scream.
The
maester
was
clucking
like
an
old
hen.
вЂњIt
would
have
been
wiser
to
leave
the
mask
in
place
until
the
flesh
had
knit,
my
lord.
Still,
it
looks
clean,
good,
good.
When
we
found
you
down
in
that
cellar
among
the
dead
and
dying,
your
wounds
were
filthy.
One
of
your
ribs
was
broken,
doubtless
you
can
feel
it,
the
blow
of
some
mace
perhaps,
or
a
fall,
itвЂ™s
hard
to
say.
And
you
took
an
arrow
in
the
arm,
there
where
it
joins
the
shoulder.
It
showed
signs
of
mortification,
and
for
a
time
I
feared
you
might
lose
the
limb,
but
we
treated
it
with
boiling
wine
and
maggots,
and
now
it
seems
to
be
healing
cleanвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњName,вЂќ
Tyrion
breathed
up
at
him.
вЂњName.вЂќ

The
maester
blinked.
вЂњWhy,
you
are
Tyrion
Lannister,
my
lord.
Brother
to
the
queen.
Do
you
remember
the
battle?
Sometimes
with
head
woundsвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњYour
name.вЂќ
His
throat
was
raw,
and
his
tongue
had
forgotten
how
to
shape
the
words.

вЂњI
am
Maester
Ballabar.вЂќ

вЂњBallabar,вЂќ
Tyrion
repeated.
вЂњBring
me.
Looking
glass.вЂќ

вЂњMy
lord,вЂќ
the
maester
said,
вЂњI
would
not
counselвЂ¦
that
might
be,
ah,
unwise,
as
it
wereвЂ¦
your
woundвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњBring
it,вЂќ
he
had
to
say.
His
mouth
was
stiff
and
sore,
as
if
a
punch
had
split
his
lip.
вЂњAnd
drink.
Wine.
No
poppy.вЂќ

The
maester
rose
flush-faced
and
hurried
off.
He
came
back
with
a
flagon
of
pale
amber
wine
and
a
small
silvered
looking
glass
in
an
ornate
golden
frame.
Sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed,
he
poured
half
a
cup
of
wine
and
held
it
to
TyrionвЂ™s
swollen
lips.
The
trickle
went
down
cool,
though
he
could
hardly
taste
it.
вЂњMore,вЂќ
he
said
when
the
cup
was
empty.
Maester
Ballabar
poured
again.
By
the
end
of
the
second
cup,
Tyrion
Lannister
felt
strong
enough
to
face
his
face.

He
turned
over
the
glass,
and
did
not
know
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry.
The
gash
was
long
and
crooked,
starting
a
hair
under
his
left
eye
and
ending
on
the
right
side
of
his
jaw.
Three-quarters
of
his
nose
was
gone,
and
a
chunk
of
his
lip.
Someone
had
sewn
the
torn
flesh
together
with
catgut,
and
their
clumsy
stitches
were
still
in
place
across
the
seam
of
raw,
red,
half-healed
flesh.
вЂњPretty,вЂќ
he
croaked,
flinging
the
glass
aside.

He
remembered
now.
The
bridge
of
boats,
Ser
Mandon
Moore,
a
hand,
a
sword
coming
at
his
face.
If
I
had
not
pulled
back,
that
cut
would
have
taken
off
the
top
of
my
head.
Jaime
had
always
said
that
Ser
Mandon
was
the
most
dangerous
of
the
Kingsguard,
because
his
dead
empty
eyes
gave
no
hint
to
his
intentions.
I
should
never
have
trusted
any
of
them.
HeвЂ™d
known
that
Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Boros
were
his
sisterвЂ™s,
and
Ser
Osmund
later,
but
he
had
let
himself
believe
that
the
others
were
not
wholly
lost
to
honor.
Cersei
must
have
paid
him
to
see
that
I
never
came
back
from
the
battle.
Why
else?
I
never
did
Ser
Mandon
any
harm
that
I
know
of.
Tyrion
touched
his
face,
plucking
at
the
proud
flesh
with
blunt
thick
fingers.
Another
gift
from
my
sweet
sister.

The
maester
stood
beside
the
bed
like
a
goose
about
to
take
flight.
вЂњMy
lord,
there,
there
will
most
like
be
a
scarвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњMost
like?вЂќ
His
snort
of
laughter
turned
into
a
wince
of
pain.
There
would
be
a
scar,
to
be
sure.
Nor
was
it
likely
that
his
nose
would
be
growing
back
anytime
soon.
It
was
not
as
if
his
face
had
ever
been
fit
to
look
at.
вЂњTeach
me,
not
to,
play
with,
axes.вЂќ
His
grin
felt
tight.
вЂњWhere,
are
we?
What,
what
place?вЂќ
It
hurt
to
talk,
but
Tyrion
had
been
too
long
in
silence.

вЂњAh,
you
are
in
MaegorвЂ™s
Holdfast,
my
lord.
A
chamber
over
the
QueenвЂ™s
Ballroom.
Her
Grace
wanted
you
kept
close,
so
she
might
watch
over
you
herself.вЂќ

IвЂ™ll
wager
she
did.
вЂњReturn
me,вЂќ
Tyrion
commanded.
вЂњOwn
bed.
Own
chambers.вЂќ
Where
I
will
have
my
own
men
about
me,
and
my
own
maester
too,
if
I
find
one
I
can
trust.

вЂњYour
ownвЂ¦
my
lord,
that
would
not
be
possible.
The
KingвЂ™s
Hand
has
taken
up
residence
in
your
former
chambers.вЂќ

вЂњI.
Am.
KingвЂ™s
Hand.вЂќ
He
was
growing
exhausted
by
the
effort
of
speaking,
and
confused
by
what
he
was
hearing.

Maester
Ballabar
looked
distressed.
вЂњNo,
my
lord,
IвЂ¦
you
were
wounded,
near
death.
Your
lord
father
has
taken
up
those
duties
now.
Lord
Tywin,
heвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњHere?вЂќ

вЂњSince
the
night
of
the
battle.
Lord
Tywin
saved
us
all.
The
smallfolk
say
it
was
King
RenlyвЂ™s
ghost,
but
wiser
men
know
better.
It
was
your
father
and
Lord
Tyrell,
with
the
Knight
of
Flowers
and
Lord
Littlefinger.
They
rode
through
the
ashes
and
took
the
usurper
Stannis
in
the
rear.
It
was
a
great
victory,
and
now
Lord
Tywin
has
settled
into
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
to
help
His
Grace
set
the
realm
to
rights,
gods
be
praised.вЂќ

вЂњGods
be
praised,вЂќ
Tyrion
repeated
hollowly.
His
bloody
father
and
bloody
Littlefinger
and
RenlyвЂ™s
ghost?
вЂњI
wantвЂ¦вЂќ
Who
do
I
want?
He
could
not
tell
pink
Ballabar
to
fetch
him
Shae.
Who
could
he
send
for,
who
could
he
trust?
Varys?
Bronn?
Ser
Jacelyn?
вЂњвЂ¦my
squire,вЂќ
he
finished.
вЂњPod.
Payne.вЂќ
It
was
Pod
on
the
bridge
of
boats,
the
lad
saved
my
life.

вЂњThe
boy?
The
odd
boy?вЂќ

вЂњOdd
boy.
Podrick.
Payne.
You
go.
Send
him.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
will,
my
lord.вЂќ
Maester
Ballabar
bobbed
his
head
and
hurried
out.
Tyrion
could
feel
the
strength
seeping
out
of
him
as
he
waited.
He
wondered
how
long
he
had
been
here,
asleep.
Cersei
would
have
me
sleep
forever,
but
I
wonвЂ™t
be
so
obliging.

Podrick
Payne
entered
the
bedchamber
timid
as
a
mouse.
вЂњMy
lord?вЂќ
He
crept
close
to
the
bed.
How
can
a
boy
so
bold
in
battle
be
so
frightened
in
a
sickroom?
Tyrion
wondered.
вЂњI
meant
to
stay
by
you,
but
the
maester
sent
me
away.вЂќ

вЂњSend
him
away.
Hear
me.
TalkвЂ™s
hard.
Need
dreamwine.
Dreamwine,
not
milk
of
the
poppy.
Go
to
Frenken.
Frenken,
not
Ballabar.
Watch
him
make
it.
Bring
it
here.вЂќ
Pod
stole
a
glance
at
TyrionвЂ™s
face,
and
just
as
quickly
averted
his
eyes.
Well,
I
cannot
blame
him
for
that.
вЂњI
want,вЂќ
Tyrion
went
on,
вЂњmine
own.
Guard.
Bronn.
WhereвЂ™s
Bronn?вЂќ

вЂњThey
made
him
a
knight.вЂќ

Even
frowning
hurt.
вЂњFind
him.
Bring
him.вЂќ

вЂњAs
you
say.
My
lord.
Bronn.вЂќ

Tyrion
seized
the
ladвЂ™s
wrist.
вЂњSer
Mandon?вЂќ

The
boy
flinched.
вЂњI
n-never
meant
to
k-k-k-kвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњDead?
YouвЂ™re,
certain?
Dead?вЂќ

He
shuffled
his
feet,
sheepish.
вЂњDrowned.вЂќ

вЂњGood.
Say
nothing.
Of
him.
Of
me.
Any
of
it.
Nothing.вЂќ

By
the
time
his
squire
left,
the
last
of
TyrionвЂ™s
strength
was
gone
as
well.
He
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes.
Perhaps
he
would
dream
of
Tysha
again.
I
wonder
how
sheвЂ™d
like
my
face
now,
he
thought
bitterly.





JON

When
Qhorin
Halfhand
told
him
to
find
some
brush
for
a
fire,
Jon
knew
their
end
was
near.

It
will
be
good
to
feel
warm
again,
if
only
for
a
little
while,
he
told
himself
while
he
hacked
bare
branches
from
the
trunk
of
a
dead
tree.
Ghost
sat
on
his
haunches
watching,
silent
as
ever.
Will
he
howl
for
me
when
IвЂ™m
dead,
as
BranвЂ™s
wolf
howled
when
he
fell?
Jon
wondered.
Will
Shaggydog
howl,
far
off
in
Winterfell,
and
Grey
Wind
and
Nymeria,
wherever
they
might
be?

The
moon
was
rising
behind
one
mountain
and
the
sun
sinking
behind
another
as
Jon
struck
sparks
from
flint
and
dagger,
until
finally
a
wisp
of
smoke
appeared.
Qhorin
came
and
stood
over
him
as
the
first
flame
rose
up
flickering
from
the
shavings
of
bark
and
dead
dry
pine
needles.
вЂњAs
shy
as
a
maid
on
her
wedding
night,вЂќ
the
big
ranger
said
in
a
soft
voice,
вЂњand
near
as
fair.
Sometimes
a
man
forgets
how
pretty
a
fire
can
be.вЂќ

He
was
not
a
man
youвЂ™d
expect
to
speak
of
maids
and
wedding
nights.
So
far
as
Jon
knew,
Qhorin
had
spent
his
whole
life
in
the
Watch.
Did
he
ever
love
a
maid
or
have
a
wedding?
He
could
not
ask.
Instead
he
fanned
the
fire.
When
the
blaze
was
all
acrackle,
he
peeled
off
his
stiff
gloves
to
warm
his
hands,
and
sighed,
wondering
if
ever
a
kiss
had
felt
as
good.
The
warmth
spread
through
his
fingers
like
melting
butter.

The
Halfhand
eased
himself
to
the
ground
and
sat
cross-legged
by
the
fire,
the
flickering
light
playing
across
the
hard
planes
of
his
face.
Only
the
two
of
them
remained
of
the
five
rangers
who
had
fled
the
Skirling
Pass,
back
into
the
blue-grey
wilderness
of
the
Frostfangs.

At
first
Jon
had
nursed
the
hope
that
Squire
Dalbridge
would
keep
the
wildlings
bottled
up
in
the
pass.
But
when
theyвЂ™d
heard
the
call
of
a
far-off
horn
every
man
of
them
knew
the
squire
had
fallen.
Later
they
spied
the
eagle
soaring
through
the
dusk
on
great
blue-grey
wings
and
Stonesnake
unslung
his
bow,
but
the
bird
flew
out
of
range
before
he
could
so
much
as
string
it.
Ebben
spat
and
muttered
darkly
of
wargs
and
skinchangers.

They
glimpsed
the
eagle
twice
more
the
day
after,
and
heard
the
hunting
horn
behind
them
echoing
against
the
mountains.
Each
time
it
seemed
a
little
louder,
a
little
closer.
When
night
fell,
the
Halfhand
told
Ebben
to
take
the
squireвЂ™s
garron
as
well
as
his
own,
and
ride
east
for
Mormont
with
all
haste,
back
the
way
they
had
come.
The
rest
of
them
would
draw
off
the
pursuit.
вЂњSend
Jon,вЂќ
Ebben
had
urged.
вЂњHe
can
ride
as
fast
as
me.вЂќ

вЂњJon
has
a
different
part
to
play.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
half
a
boy
still.вЂќ

вЂњNo,вЂќ
said
Qhorin,
вЂњhe
is
a
man
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch.вЂќ

When
the
moon
rose,
Ebben
parted
from
them.
Stonesnake
went
east
with
him
a
short
way,
then
doubled
back
to
obscure
their
tracks,
and
the
three
who
remained
set
off
toward
the
southwest.

After
that
the
days
and
nights
blurred
one
into
the
other.
They
slept
in
their
saddles
and
stopped
only
long
enough
to
feed
and
water
the
garrons,
then
mounted
up
again.
Over
bare
rock
they
rode,
through
gloomy
pine
forests
and
drifts
of
old
snow,
over
icy
ridges
and
across
shallow
rivers
that
had
no
names.
Sometimes
Qhorin
or
Stonesnake
would
loop
back
to
sweep
away
their
tracks,
but
it
was
a
futile
gesture.
They
were
watched.
At
every
dawn
and
every
dusk
they
saw
the
eagle
soaring
between
the
peaks,
no
more
than
a
speck
in
the
vastness
of
the
sky.

They
were
scaling
a
low
ridge
between
two
snowcapped
peaks
when
a
shadowcat
came
snarling
from
its
lair,
not
ten
yards
away.
The
beast
was
gaunt
and
half-starved,
but
the
sight
of
it
sent
StonesnakeвЂ™s
mare
into
a
panic;
she
reared
and
ran,
and
before
the
ranger
could
get
her
back
under
control
she
had
stumbled
on
the
steep
slope
and
broken
a
leg.

Ghost
ate
well
that
day,
and
Qhorin
insisted
that
the
rangers
mix
some
of
the
garronвЂ™s
blood
with
their
oats,
to
give
them
strength.
The
taste
of
that
foul
porridge
almost
choked
Jon,
but
he
forced
it
down.
They
each
cut
a
dozen
strips
of
raw
stringy
meat
from
the
carcass
to
chew
on
as
they
rode,
and
left
the
rest
for
the
shadowcats.

There
was
no
question
of
riding
double.
Stonesnake
offered
to
lay
in
wait
for
the
pursuit
and
surprise
them
when
they
came.
Perhaps
he
could
take
a
few
of
them
with
him
down
to
hell.
Qhorin
refused.
вЂњIf
any
man
in
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch
can
make
it
through
the
Frostfangs
alone
and
afoot,
it
is
you,
brother.
You
can
go
over
mountains
that
a
horse
must
go
around.
Make
for
the
Fist.
Tell
Mormont
what
Jon
saw,
and
how.
Tell
him
that
the
old
powers
are
waking,
that
he
faces
giants
and
wargs
and
worse.
Tell
him
that
the
trees
have
eyes
again.вЂќ

He
has
no
chance,
Jon
thought
when
he
watched
Stonesnake
vanish
over
a
snow-covered
ridge,
a
tiny
black
bug
crawling
across
a
rippling
expanse
of
white.

After
that,
every
night
seemed
colder
than
the
night
before,
and
more
lonely.
Ghost
was
not
always
with
them,
but
he
was
never
far
either.
Even
when
they
were
apart,
Jon
sensed
his
nearness.
He
was
glad
for
that.
The
Halfhand
was
not
the
most
companionable
of
men.
QhorinвЂ™s
long
grey
braid
swung
slowly
with
the
motion
of
his
horse.
Often
they
would
ride
for
hours
without
a
word
spoken,
the
only
sounds
the
soft
scrape
of
horseshoes
on
stone
and
the
keening
of
the
wind,
which
blew
endlessly
through
the
heights.
When
he
slept,
he
did
not
dream;
not
of
wolves,
nor
his
brothers,
nor
anything.
Even
dreams
cannot
live
up
here,
he
told
himself.

вЂњIs
your
sword
sharp,
Jon
Snow?вЂќ
asked
Qhorin
Halfhand
across
the
flickering
fire.

вЂњMy
sword
is
Valyrian
steel.
The
Old
Bear
gave
it
to
me.вЂќ

вЂњDo
you
remember
the
words
of
your
vow?вЂќ

вЂњYes.вЂќ
They
were
not
words
a
man
was
like
to
forget.
Once
said,
they
could
never
be
unsaid.
They
changed
your
life
forever.

вЂњSay
them
again
with
me,
Jon
Snow.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
like.вЂќ
Their
voices
blended
as
one
beneath
the
rising
moon,
while
Ghost
listened
and
the
mountains
themselves
bore
witness.
вЂњNight
gathers,
and
now
my
watch
begins.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.
I
shall
take
no
wife,
hold
no
lands,
father
no
children.
I
shall
wear
no
crowns
and
win
no
glory.
I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post.
I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
I
am
the
watcher
on
the
walls.
I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.
I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch,
for
this
night
and
all
the
nights
to
come.вЂќ

When
they
were
done,
there
was
no
sound
but
the
faint
crackle
of
the
flames
and
a
distant
sigh
of
wind.
Jon
opened
and
closed
his
burnt
fingers,
holding
tight
to
the
words
in
his
mind,
praying
that
his
fatherвЂ™s
gods
would
give
him
the
strength
to
die
bravely
when
his
hour
came.
It
would
not
be
long
now.
The
garrons
were
near
the
end
of
their
strength.
QhorinвЂ™s
mount
would
not
last
another
day,
Jon
suspected.

The
flames
were
burning
low
by
then,
the
warmth
fading.
вЂњThe
fire
will
soon
go
out,вЂќ
Qhorin
said,
вЂњbut
if
the
Wall
should
ever
fall,
all
the
fires
will
go
out.вЂќ

There
was
nothing
Jon
could
say
to
that.
He
nodded.

вЂњWe
may
escape
them
yet,вЂќ
the
ranger
said.
вЂњOr
not.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™m
not
afraid
to
die.вЂќ
It
was
only
half
a
lie.

вЂњIt
may
not
be
so
easy
as
that,
Jon.вЂќ

He
did
not
understand.
вЂњWhat
do
you
mean?вЂќ

вЂњIf
we
are
taken,
you
must
yield.вЂќ

вЂњYield?вЂќ
He
blinked
in
disbelief.
The
wildlings
did
not
make
captives
of
the
men
they
called
the
crows.
They
killed
them,
except
forвЂ¦вЂњThey
only
spare
oathbreakers.
Those
who
join
them,
like
Mance
Rayder.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
you.вЂќ

вЂњNo.вЂќ
He
shook
his
head.
вЂњNever.
I
wonвЂ™t.вЂќ

вЂњYou
will.
I
command
it
of
you.вЂќ

вЂњCommand
it?
ButвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњOur
honor
means
no
more
than
our
lives,
so
long
as
the
realm
is
safe.
Are
you
a
man
of
the
NightвЂ™s
Watch?вЂќ

вЂњYes,
butвЂ”вЂќ

вЂњThere
is
no
but,
Jon
Snow.
You
are,
or
you
are
not.вЂќ

Jon
sat
up
straight.
вЂњI
am.вЂќ

вЂњThen
hear
me.
If
we
are
taken,
you
will
go
over
to
them,
as
the
wildling
girl
you
captured
once
urged
you.
They
may
demand
that
you
cut
your
cloak
to
ribbons,
that
you
swear
them
an
oath
on
your
fatherвЂ™s
grave,
that
you
curse
your
brothers
and
your
Lord
Commander.
You
must
not
balk,
whatever
is
asked
of
you.
Do
as
they
bid
youвЂ¦
but
in
your
heart,
remember
who
and
what
you
are.
Ride
with
them,
eat
with
them,
fight
with
them,
for
as
long
as
it
takes.
And
watch.вЂќ

вЂњFor
what?вЂќ
Jon
asked.

вЂњWould
that
I
knew,вЂќ
said
Qhorin.
вЂњYour
wolf
saw
their
diggings
in
the
valley
of
the
Milkwater.
What
did
they
seek,
in
such
a
bleak
and
distant
place?
Did
they
find
it?
That
is
what
you
must
learn,
before
you
return
to
Lord
Mormont
and
your
brothers.
That
is
the
duty
I
lay
on
you,
Jon
Snow.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
do
as
you
say,вЂќ
Jon
said
reluctantly,
вЂњbutвЂ¦
you
will
tell
them,
wonвЂ™t
you?
The
Old
Bear,
at
least?
YouвЂ™ll
tell
him
that
I
never
broke
my
oath.вЂќ

Qhorin
Halfhand
gazed
at
him
across
the
fire,
his
eyes
lost
in
pools
of
shadow.
вЂњWhen
I
see
him
next.
I
swear
it.вЂќ
He
gestured
at
the
fire.
вЂњMore
wood.
I
want
it
bright
and
hot.вЂќ

Jon
went
to
cut
more
branches,
snapping
each
one
in
two
before
tossing
it
into
the
flames.
The
tree
had
been
dead
a
long
time,
but
it
seemed
to
live
again
in
the
fire,
as
fiery
dancers
woke
within
each
stick
of
wood
to
whirl
and
spin
in
their
glowing
gowns
of
yellow,
red,
and
orange.

вЂњEnough,вЂќ
Qhorin
said
abruptly.
вЂњNow
we
ride.вЂќ

вЂњRide?вЂќ
It
was
dark
beyond
the
fire,
and
the
night
was
cold.
вЂњRide
where?вЂќ

вЂњBack.вЂќ
Qhorin
mounted
his
weary
garron
one
more
time.
вЂњThe
fire
will
draw
them
past,
I
hope.
Come,
brother.вЂќ

Jon
pulled
on
his
gloves
again
and
raised
his
hood.
Even
the
horses
seemed
reluctant
to
leave
the
fire.
The
sun
was
long
gone,
and
only
the
cold
silver
shine
of
the
half-moon
remained
to
light
their
way
over
the
treacherous
ground
that
lay
behind
them.
He
did
not
know
what
Qhorin
had
in
mind,
but
perhaps
it
was
a
chance.
He
hoped
so.
I
do
not
want
to
play
the
oathbreaker,
even
for
good
reason.

They
went
cautiously,
moving
as
silent
as
man
and
horse
could
move,
retracing
their
steps
until
they
reached
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
defile
where
an
icy
little
stream
emerged
from
between
two
mountains.
Jon
remembered
the
place.
They
had
watered
the
horses
here
before
the
sun
went
down.

вЂњThe
waterвЂ™s
icing
up,вЂќ
Qhorin
observed
as
he
turned
aside,
вЂњelse
weвЂ™d
ride
in
the
streambed.
But
if
we
break
the
ice,
they
are
like
to
see.
Keep
close
to
the
cliffs.
ThereвЂ™s
a
crook
a
half
mile
on
that
will
hide
us.вЂќ
He
rode
into
the
defile.
Jon
gave
one
last
wistful
look
to
their
distant
fire,
and
followed.

The
farther
in
they
went,
the
closer
the
cliffs
pressed
to
either
side.
They
followed
the
moonlit
ribbon
of
stream
back
toward
its
source.
Icicles
bearded
its
stony
banks,
but
Jon
could
still
hear
the
sound
of
rushing
water
beneath
the
thin
hard
crust.

A
great
jumble
of
fallen
rock
blocked
their
way
partway
up,
where
a
section
of
the
cliff
face
had
fallen,
but
the
surefooted
little
garrons
were
able
to
pick
their
way
through.
Beyond,
the
walls
pinched
in
sharply,
and
the
stream
led
them
to
the
foot
of
a
tall
twisting
waterfall.
The
air
was
full
of
mist,
like
the
breath
of
some
vast
cold
beast.
The
tumbling
waters
shone
silver
in
the
moonlight.
Jon
looked
about
in
dismay.
There
is
no
way
out.
He
and
Qhorin
might
be
able
to
climb
the
cliffs,
but
not
with
the
horses.
He
did
not
think
they
would
last
long
afoot.

вЂњQuickly
now,вЂќ
the
Halfhand
commanded.
The
big
man
on
the
small
horse
rode
over
the
ice-slick
stones,
right
into
the
curtain
of
water,
and
vanished.
When
he
did
not
reappear,
Jon
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
went
after.
His
garron
did
his
best
to
shy
away.
The
falling
water
slapped
at
them
with
frozen
fists,
and
the
shock
of
the
cold
seemed
to
stop
JonвЂ™s
breath.

Then
he
was
through;
drenched
and
shivering,
but
through.

The
cleft
in
the
rock
was
barely
large
enough
for
man
and
horse
to
pass,
but
beyond,
the
walls
opened
up
and
the
floor
turned
to
soft
sand.
Jon
could
feel
the
spray
freezing
in
his
beard.
Ghost
burst
through
the
waterfall
in
an
angry
rush,
shook
droplets
from
his
fur,
sniffed
at
the
darkness
suspiciously,
then
lifted
a
leg
against
one
rocky
wall.
Qhorin
had
already
dismounted.
Jon
did
the
same.
вЂњYou
knew
this
place
was
here.вЂќ

вЂњWhen
I
was
no
older
than
you,
I
heard
a
brother
tell
how
he
followed
a
shadowcat
through
these
falls.вЂќ
He
unsaddled
his
horse,
removed
her
bit
and
bridle,
and
ran
his
fingers
through
her
shaggy
mane.
вЂњThere
is
a
way
through
the
heart
of
the
mountain.
Come
dawn,
if
they
have
not
found
us,
we
will
press
on.
The
first
watch
is
mine,
brother.вЂќ
Qhorin
seated
himself
on
the
sand,
his
back
to
a
wall,
no
more
than
a
vague
black
shadow
in
the
gloom
of
the
cave.
Over
the
rush
of
falling
waters,
Jon
heard
a
soft
sound
of
steel
on
leather
that
could
only
mean
that
the
Halfhand
had
drawn
his
sword.

He
took
off
his
wet
cloak,
but
it
was
too
cold
and
damp
here
to
strip
down
any
further.
Ghost
stretched
out
beside
him
and
licked
his
glove
before
curling
up
to
sleep.
Jon
was
grateful
for
his
warmth.
He
wondered
if
the
fire
was
still
burning
outside,
or
if
it
had
gone
out
by
now.
If
the
Wall
should
ever
fall,
all
the
fires
will
go
out.
The
moon
shone
through
the
curtain
of
falling
water
to
lay
a
shimmering
pale
stripe
across
the
sand,
but
after
a
time
that
too
faded
and
went
dark.

Sleep
came
at
last,
and
with
it
nightmares.
He
dreamed
of
burning
castles
and
dead
men
rising
unquiet
from
their
graves.
It
was
still
dark
when
Qhorin
woke
him.
While
the
Halfhand
slept,
Jon
sat
with
his
back
to
the
cave
wall,
listening
to
the
water
and
waiting
for
the
dawn.

At
break
of
day,
they
each
chewed
a
half-frozen
strip
of
horsemeat,
then
saddled
their
garrons
once
again,
and
fastened
their
black
cloaks
around
their
shoulders.
During
his
watch
the
Halfhand
had
made
a
half-dozen
torches,
soaking
bundles
of
dry
moss
with
the
oil
he
carried
in
his
saddlebag.
He
lit
the
first
one
now
and
led
the
way
down
into
the
dark,
holding
the
pale
flame
up
before
him.
Jon
followed
with
the
horses.
The
stony
path
twisted
and
turned,
first
down,
then
up,
then
down
more
steeply.
In
spots
it
grew
so
narrow
it
was
hard
to
convince
the
garrons
they
could
squeeze
through.
By
the
time
we
come
out
we
will
have
lost
them,
he
told
himself
as
they
went.
Not
even
an
eagle
can
see
through
solid
stone.
We
will
have
lost
them,
and
we
will
ride
hard
for
the
Fist,
and
tell
the
Old
Bear
all
we
know.

But
when
they
emerged
back
into
the
light
long
hours
later,
the
eagle
was
waiting
for
them,
perched
on
a
dead
tree
a
hundred
feet
up
the
slope.
Ghost
went
bounding
up
the
rocks
after
it,
but
the
bird
flapped
its
wings
and
took
to
the
air.

QhorinвЂ™s
mouth
tightened
as
he
followed
its
flight
with
his
eyes.

вЂњHere
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
make
a
stand,вЂќ
he
declared.
вЂњThe
mouth
of
the
cave
shelters
us
from
above,
and
they
cannot
get
behind
us
without
passing
through
the
mountain.
Is
your
sword
sharp,
Jon
Snow?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
he
said.

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
feed
the
horses.
TheyвЂ™ve
served
us
bravely,
poor
beasts.вЂќ

Jon
gave
his
garron
the
last
of
the
oats
and
stroked
his
shaggy
mane
while
Ghost
prowled
restlessly
amongst
the
rocks.
He
pulled
his
gloves
on
tighter
and
flexed
his
burnt
fingers.
I
am
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.

A
hunting
horn
echoed
through
the
mountains,
and
a
moment
later
Jon
heard
the
baying
of
hounds.
вЂњThey
will
be
with
us
soon,вЂќ
announced
Qhorin.
вЂњKeep
your
wolf
in
hand.вЂќ

вЂњGhost,
to
me,вЂќ
Jon
called.
The
direwolf
returned
reluctantly
to
his
side,
tail
held
stiffly
behind
him.

The
wildlings
came
boiling
over
a
ridge
not
half
a
mile
away.
Their
hounds
ran
before
them,
snarling
grey-brown
beasts
with
more
than
a
little
wolf
in
their
blood.
Ghost
bared
his
teeth,
his
fur
bristling.
вЂњEasy,вЂќ
Jon
murmured.
вЂњStay.вЂќ
Overhead
he
heard
a
rustle
of
wings.
The
eagle
landed
on
an
outcrop
of
rock
and
screamed
in
triumph.

The
hunters
approached
warily,
perhaps
fearing
arrows.
Jon
counted
fourteen,
with
eight
dogs.
Their
large
round
shields
were
made
of
skins
stretched
over
woven
wicker
and
painted
with
skulls.
About
half
of
them
hid
their
faces
behind
crude
helms
of
wood
and
boiled
leather.
On
either
wing,
archers
notched
shafts
to
the
strings
of
small
wood-and-horn
bows,
but
did
not
loose.
The
rest
seemed
to
be
armed
with
spears
and
mauls.
One
had
a
chipped
stone
axe.
They
wore
only
what
bits
of
armor
they
had
looted
from
dead
rangers
or
stolen
during
raids.
Wildlings
did
not
mine
or
smelt,
and
there
were
few
smiths
and
fewer
forges
north
of
the
Wall.

Qhorin
drew
his
longsword.
The
tale
of
how
he
had
taught
himself
to
fight
with
his
left
hand
after
losing
half
of
his
right
was
part
of
his
legend;
it
was
said
that
he
handled
a
blade
better
now
than
he
ever
had
before.
Jon
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
big
ranger
and
pulled
Longclaw
from
its
sheath.
Despite
the
chill
in
the
air,
sweat
stung
his
eyes.

Ten
yards
below
the
cave
mouth
the
hunters
halted.
Their
leader
came
on
alone,
riding
a
beast
that
seemed
more
goat
than
horse,
from
the
surefooted
way
it
climbed
the
uneven
slope.
As
man
and
mount
grew
nearer
Jon
could
hear
them
clattering;
both
were
armored
in
bones.
Cow
bones,
sheep
bones,
the
bones
of
goats
and
aurochs
and
elk,
the
great
bones
of
the
hairy
mammothsвЂ¦
and
human
bones
as
well.

вЂњRattleshirt,вЂќ
Qhorin
called
down,
icy-polite.

вЂњTo
crows
I
be
the
Lord
oвЂ™
Bones.вЂќ
The
riderвЂ™s
helm
was
made
from
the
broken
skull
of
a
giant,
and
all
up
and
down
his
arms
bearclaws
had
been
sewn
to
his
boiled
leather.

Qhorin
snorted.
вЂњI
see
no
lord.
Only
a
dog
dressed
in
chickenbones,
who
rattles
when
he
rides.вЂќ

The
wildling
hissed
in
anger,
and
his
mount
reared.
He
did
rattle,
Jon
could
hear
it;
the
bones
were
strung
together
loosely,
so
they
clacked
and
clattered
when
he
moved.
вЂњItвЂ™s
your
bones
IвЂ™ll
be
rattling
soon,
Halfhand.
IвЂ™ll
boil
the
flesh
off
you
and
make
a
byrnie
from
your
ribs.
IвЂ™ll
carve
your
teeth
to
cast
me
runes,
and
eat
me
oaten
porridge
from
your
skull.вЂќ

вЂњIf
you
want
my
bones,
come
get
them.вЂќ

That,
Rattleshirt
seemed
reluctant
to
do.
His
numbers
meant
little
in
the
close
confines
of
the
rocks
where
the
black
brothers
had
taken
their
stand;
to
winkle
them
out
of
the
cave
the
wildlings
would
need
to
come
up
two
at
a
time.
But
another
of
his
company
edged
a
horse
up
beside
him,
one
of
the
fighting
women
called
spearwives.
вЂњWe
are
four-and-ten
to
two,
crows,
and
eight
dogs
to
your
wolf,вЂќ
she
called.
вЂњFight
or
run,
you
are
ours.вЂќ

вЂњShow
them,вЂќ
commanded
Rattleshirt.

The
woman
reached
into
a
bloodstained
sack
and
drew
out
a
trophy.
Ebben
had
been
bald
as
an
egg,
so
she
dangled
the
head
by
an
ear.
вЂњHe
died
brave,вЂќ
she
said.

вЂњBut
he
died,вЂќ
said
Rattleshirt,
вЂњsame
like
you.вЂќ
He
freed
his
battleaxe,
brandishing
it
above
his
head.
Good
steel
it
was,
with
a
wicked
gleam
to
both
blades;
Ebben
was
never
a
man
to
neglect
his
weapons.
The
other
wildlings
crowded
forward
beside
him,
yelling
taunts.
A
few
chose
Jon
for
their
mockery.
вЂњIs
that
your
wolf,
boy?вЂќ
a
skinny
youth
called,
unlimbering
a
stone
flail.
вЂњHeвЂ™ll
be
my
cloak
before
the
sun
is
down.вЂќ
On
the
other
side
of
the
line,
another
spearwife
opened
her
ragged
furs
to
show
Jon
a
heavy
white
breast.
вЂњDoes
the
baby
want
his
momma?
Come,
have
a
suck
oвЂ™
this,
boy.вЂќ
The
dogs
were
barking
too.

вЂњThey
would
shame
us
into
folly.вЂќ
Qhorin
gave
Jon
a
long
look.
вЂњRemember
your
orders.вЂќ

вЂњBelike
we
need
to
flush
the
crows,вЂќ
Rattleshirt
bellowed
over
the
clamor.
вЂњFeather
them!вЂќ

вЂњNo!вЂќ
The
word
burst
from
JonвЂ™s
lips
before
the
bowmen
could
loose.
He
took
two
quick
steps
forward.
вЂњWe
yield!вЂќ

вЂњThey
warned
me
bastard
blood
was
craven,вЂќ
he
heard
Qhorin
Halfhand
say
coldly
behind
him.
вЂњI
see
it
is
so.
Run
to
your
new
masters,
coward.вЂќ

Face
reddening,
Jon
descended
the
slope
to
where
Rattleshirt
sat
his
horse.
The
wildling
stared
at
him
through
the
eyeholes
of
his
helm,
and
said,
вЂњThe
free
folk
have
no
need
of
cravens.вЂќ

вЂњHe
is
no
craven.вЂќ
One
of
the
archers
pulled
off
her
sewn
sheepskin
helm
and
shook
out
a
head
of
shaggy
red
hair.
вЂњThis
is
the
Bastard
oвЂ™
Winterfell,
who
spared
me.
Let
him
live.вЂќ

Jon
met
YgritteвЂ™s
eyes,
and
had
no
words.

вЂњLet
him
die,вЂќ
insisted
the
Lord
of
Bones.
вЂњThe
black
crow
is
a
tricksy
bird.
I
trust
him
not.вЂќ

On
a
rock
above
them,
the
eagle
flapped
its
wings
and
split
the
air
with
a
scream
of
fury.

вЂњThe
bird
hates
you,
Jon
Snow,вЂќ
said
Ygritte.
вЂњAnd
well
he
might.
He
was
a
man,
before
you
killed
him.вЂќ

вЂњI
did
not
know,вЂќ
said
Jon
truthfully,
trying
to
remember
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
slain
in
the
pass.
вЂњYou
told
me
Mance
would
take
me.вЂќ

вЂњAnd
he
will,вЂќ
Ygritte
said.

вЂњMance
is
not
here,вЂќ
said
Rattleshirt.
вЂњRagwyle,
gut
him.вЂќ

The
big
spearwife
narrowed
her
eyes
and
said,
вЂњIf
the
crow
would
join
the
free
folk,
let
him
show
us
his
prowess
and
prove
the
truth
of
him.вЂќ

вЂњIвЂ™ll
do
whatever
you
ask.вЂќ
The
words
came
hard,
but
Jon
said
them.

RattleshirtвЂ™s
bone
armor
clattered
loudly
as
he
laughed.
вЂњThen
kill
the
Halfhand,
bastard.вЂќ

вЂњAs
if
he
could,вЂќ
said
Qhorin.
вЂњTurn,
Snow,
and
die.вЂќ

And
then
QhorinвЂ™s
sword
was
coming
at
him
and
somehow
Longclaw
leapt
upward
to
block.
The
force
of
impact
almost
knocked
the
bastard
blade
from
JonвЂ™s
hand,
and
sent
him
staggering
backward.
You
must
not
balk,
whatever
is
asked
of
you.
He
shifted
to
a
two-hand
grip,
quick
enough
to
deliver
a
stroke
of
his
own,
but
the
big
ranger
brushed
it
aside
with
contemptuous
ease.
Back
and
forth
they
went,
black
cloaks
swirling,
the
youthвЂ™s
quickness
against
the
savage
strength
of
QhorinвЂ™s
left-hand
cuts.
The
HalfhandвЂ™s
longsword
seemed
to
be
everywhere
at
once,
raining
down
from
one
side
and
then
the
other,
driving
him
where
he
would,
keeping
him
off
balance.
Already
he
could
feel
his
arms
growing
numb.

Even
when
GhostвЂ™s
teeth
closed
savagely
around
the
rangerвЂ™s
calf,
somehow
Qhorin
kept
his
feet.
But
in
that
instant,
as
he
twisted,
the
opening
was
there.
Jon
planted
and
pivoted.
The
ranger
was
leaning
away,
and
for
an
instant
it
seemed
that
JonвЂ™s
slash
had
not
touched
him.
Then
a
string
of
red
tears
appeared
across
the
big
manвЂ™s
throat,
bright
as
a
ruby
necklace,
and
the
blood
gushed
out
of
him,
and
Qhorin
Halfhand
fell.

GhostвЂ™s
muzzle
was
dripping
red,
but
only
the
point
of
the
bastard
blade
was
stained,
the
last
half
inch.
Jon
pulled
the
direwolf
away
and
knelt
with
one
arm
around
him.
The
light
was
already
fading
in
QhorinвЂ™s
eyes.
вЂњвЂ¦sharp,вЂќ
he
said,
lifting
his
maimed
fingers.
Then
his
hand
fell,
and
he
was
gone.

He
knew,
he
thought
numbly.
He
knew
what
they
would
ask
of
me.
He
thought
of
Samwell
Tarly
then,
of
Grenn
and
Dolorous
Edd,
of
Pyp
and
Toad
back
at
Castle
Black.
Had
he
lost
them
all,
as
he
had
lost
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb?
Who
was
he
now?
What
was
he?

вЂњGet
him
up.вЂќ
Rough
hands
dragged
him
to
his
feet.
Jon
did
not
resist.
вЂњDo
you
have
a
name?вЂќ

Ygritte
answered
for
him.
вЂњHis
name
is
Jon
Snow.
He
is
Eddard
StarkвЂ™s
blood,
of
Winterfell.вЂќ

Ragwyle
laughed.
вЂњWho
would
have
thought
it?
Qhorin
Halfhand
slain
by
some
lordlingвЂ™s
byblow.вЂќ

вЂњGut
him.вЂќ
That
was
Rattleshirt,
still
ahorse.
The
eagle
flew
to
him
and
perched
atop
his
bony
helm,
screeching.

вЂњHe
yielded,вЂќ
Ygritte
reminded
them.

вЂњAye,
and
slew
his
brother,вЂќ
said
a
short
homely
man
in
a
rust-eaten
iron
halfhelm.

Rattleshirt
rode
closer,
bones
clattering.
вЂњThe
wolf
did
his
work
for
him.
It
were
foully
done.
The
HalfhandвЂ™s
death
was
mine.вЂќ

вЂњWe
all
saw
how
eager
you
were
to
take
it,вЂќ
mocked
Ragwyle.

вЂњHe
is
a
warg,вЂќ
said
the
Lord
of
Bones,
вЂњand
a
crow.
I
like
him
not.вЂќ

вЂњA
warg
he
may
be,вЂќ
Ygritte
said,
вЂњbut
that
has
never
frightened
us.вЂќ
Others
shouted
agreement.
Behind
the
eyeholes
of
his
yellowed
skull
RattleshirtвЂ™s
stare
was
malignant,
but
he
yielded
grudgingly.
These
are
a
free
folk
indeed,
thought
Jon.

They
burned
Qhorin
Halfhand
where
heвЂ™d
fallen,
on
a
pyre
made
of
pine
needles,
brush,
and
broken
branches.
Some
of
the
wood
was
still
green,
and
it
burned
slow
and
smoky,
sending
a
black
plume
up
into
the
bright
hard
blue
of
the
sky.
Afterward
Rattleshirt
claimed
some
charred
bones,
while
the
others
threw
dice
for
the
rangerвЂ™s
gear.
Ygritte
won
his
cloak.

вЂњWill
we
return
by
the
Skirling
Pass?вЂќ
Jon
asked
her.
He
did
not
know
if
he
could
face
those
heights
again,
or
if
his
garron
could
survive
a
second
crossing.

вЂњNo,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
nothing
behind
us.вЂќ
The
look
she
gave
him
was
sad.
вЂњBy
now
Mance
is
well
down
the
Milkwater,
marching
on
your
Wall.вЂќ





BRAN

The
ashes
fell
like
a
soft
grey
snow.

He
padded
over
dry
needles
and
brown
leaves,
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
the
pines
grew
thin.
Beyond
the
open
fields
he
could
see
the
great
piles
of
man-rock
stark
against
the
swirling
flames.
The
wind
blew
hot
and
rich
with
the
smell
of
blood
and
burnt
meat,
so
strong
he
began
to
slaver.

Yet
as
one
smell
drew
them
onward,
others
warned
them
back.
He
sniffed
at
the
drifting
smoke.
Men,
many
men,
many
horses,
and
fire,
fire,
fire.
No
smell
was
more
dangerous,
not
even
the
hard
cold
smell
of
iron,
the
stuff
of
man-claws
and
hardskin.
The
smoke
and
ash
clouded
his
eyes,
and
in
the
sky
he
saw
a
great
winged
snake
whose
roar
was
a
river
of
flame.
He
bared
his
teeth,
but
then
the
snake
was
gone.
Behind
the
cliffs
tall
fires
were
eating
up
the
stars.

All
through
the
night
the
fires
crackled,
and
once
there
was
a
great
roar
and
a
crash
that
made
the
earth
jump
under
his
feet.
Dogs
barked
and
whined
and
horses
screamed
in
terror.
Howls
shuddered
through
the
night;
the
howls
of
the
man-pack,
wails
of
fear
and
wild
shouts,
laughter
and
screams.
No
beast
was
as
noisy
as
man.
He
pricked
up
his
ears
and
listened,
and
his
brother
growled
at
every
sound.
They
prowled
under
the
trees
as
a
piney
wind
blew
ashes
and
embers
through
the
sky.
In
time
the
flames
began
to
dwindle,
and
then
they
were
gone.
The
sun
rose
grey
and
smoky
that
morning.

Only
then
did
he
leave
the
trees,
stalking
slow
across
the
fields.
His
brother
ran
with
him,
drawn
to
the
smell
of
blood
and
death.
They
padded
silent
through
the
dens
the
men
had
built
of
wood
and
grass
and
mud.
Many
and
more
were
burned
and
many
and
more
were
collapsed;
others
stood
as
they
had
before.
Yet
nowhere
did
they
see
or
scent
a
living
man.
Crows
blanketed
the
bodies
and
leapt
into
the
air
screeching
when
his
brother
and
he
came
near.
The
wild
dogs
slunk
away
before
them.

Beneath
the
great
grey
cliffs
a
horse
was
dying
noisily,
struggling
to
rise
on
a
broken
leg
and
screaming
when
he
fell.
His
brother
circled
round
him,
then
tore
out
his
throat
while
the
horse
kicked
feebly
and
rolled
his
eyes.
When
he
approached
the
carcass
his
brother
snapped
at
him
and
laid
back
his
ears,
and
he
cuffed
him
with
a
forepaw
and
bit
his
leg.
They
fought
amidst
the
grass
and
dirt
and
falling
ashes
beside
the
dead
horse,
until
his
brother
rolled
on
his
back
in
submission,
tail
tucked
low.
One
more
bite
at
his
upturned
throat;
then
he
fed,
and
let
his
brother
feed,
and
licked
the
blood
off
his
black
fur.

The
dark
place
was
pulling
at
him
by
then,
the
house
of
whispers
where
all
men
were
blind.
He
could
feel
its
cold
fingers
on
him.
The
stony
smell
of
it
was
a
whisper
up
the
nose.
He
struggled
against
the
pull.
He
did
not
like
the
darkness.
He
was
wolf.
He
was
hunter
and
stalker
and
slayer,
and
he
belonged
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
deep
woods,
running
free
beneath
a
starry
sky.
He
sat
on
his
haunches,
raised
his
head,
and
howled.
I
will
not
go,
he
cried.
I
am
wolf,
I
will
not
go.
Yet
even
so
the
darkness
thickened,
until
it
covered
his
eyes
and
filled
his
nose
and
stopped
his
ears,
so
he
could
not
see
or
smell
or
hear
or
run,
and
the
grey
cliffs
were
gone
and
the
dead
horse
was
gone
and
his
brother
was
gone
and
all
was
black
and
still
and
black
and
cold
and
black
and
dead
and
blackвЂ¦

вЂњBran,вЂќ
a
voice
was
whispering
softly.
вЂњBran,
come
back.
Come
back
now,
Bran.
BranвЂ¦вЂќ

He
closed
his
third
eye
and
opened
the
other
two,
the
old
two,
the
blind
two.
In
the
dark
place
all
men
were
blind.
But
someone
was
holding
him.
He
could
feel
arms
around
him,
the
warmth
of
a
body
snuggled
close.
He
could
hear
Hodor
singing
вЂњHodor,
hodor,
hodor,вЂќ
quietly
to
himself.

вЂњBran?вЂќ
It
was
MeeraвЂ™s
voice.
вЂњYou
were
thrashing,
making
terrible
noises.
What
did
you
see?вЂќ

вЂњWinterfell.вЂќ
His
tongue
felt
strange
and
thick
in
his
mouth.
One
day
when
I
come
back
I
wonвЂ™t
know
how
to
talk
anymore.
вЂњIt
was
Winterfell.
It
was
all
on
fire.
There
were
horse
smells,
and
steel,
and
blood.
They
killed
everyone,
Meera.вЂќ

He
felt
her
hand
on
his
face,
stroking
back
his
hair.
вЂњYouвЂ™re
all
sweaty,вЂќ
she
said.
вЂњDo
you
need
a
drink?вЂќ

вЂњA
drink,вЂќ
he
agreed.
She
held
a
skin
to
his
lips,
and
Bran
swallowed
so
fast
the
water
ran
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth.
He
was
always
weak
and
thirsty
when
he
came
back.
And
hungry
too.
He
remembered
the
dying
horse,
the
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth,
the
smell
of
burnt
flesh
in
the
morning
air.
вЂњHow
long?вЂќ

вЂњThree
days,вЂќ
said
Jojen.
The
boy
had
come
up
softfoot,
or
perhaps
he
had
been
there
all
along;
in
this
blind
black
world,
Bran
could
not
have
said.
вЂњWe
were
afraid
for
you.вЂќ

вЂњI
was
with
Summer,вЂќ
Bran
said.

вЂњToo
long.
YouвЂ™ll
starve
yourself.
Meera
dribbled
a
little
water
down
your
throat,
and
we
smeared
honey
on
your
mouth,
but
it
is
not
enough.вЂќ

вЂњI
ate,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњWe
ran
down
an
elk
and
had
to
drive
off
a
treecat
that
tried
to
steal
him.вЂќ
The
cat
had
been
tan-and-brown,
only
half
the
size
of
the
direwolves,
but
fierce.
He
remembered
the
musky
smell
of
him,
and
the
way
he
had
snarled
down
at
them
from
the
limb
of
the
oak.

вЂњThe
wolf
ate,вЂќ
Jojen
said.
вЂњNot
you.
Take
care,
Bran.
Remember
who
you
are.вЂќ

He
remembered
who
he
was
all
too
well;
Bran
the
boy,
Bran
the
broken.
Better
Bran
the
beastling.
Was
it
any
wonder
he
would
sooner
dream
his
Summer
dreams,
his
wolf
dreams?
Here
in
the
chill
damp
darkness
of
the
tomb
his
third
eye
had
finally
opened.
He
could
reach
Summer
whenever
he
wanted,
and
once
he
had
even
touched
Ghost
and
talked
to
Jon.
Though
maybe
he
had
only
dreamed
that.
He
could
not
understand
why
Jojen
was
always
trying
to
pull
him
back
now.
Bran
used
the
strength
of
his
arms
to
squirm
to
a
sitting
position.
вЂњI
have
to
tell
Osha
what
I
saw.
Is
she
here?
Where
did
she
go?вЂќ

The
wildling
woman
herself
gave
answer.
вЂњNowhere,
mвЂ™lord.
IвЂ™ve
had
my
fill
oвЂ™
blundering
in
the
black.вЂќ
He
heard
the
scrape
of
a
heel
on
stone,
turned
his
head
toward
the
sound,
but
saw
nothing.
He
thought
he
could
smell
her,
but
he
wasnвЂ™t
sure.
All
of
them
stank
alike,
and
he
did
not
have
SummerвЂ™s
nose
to
tell
one
from
the
other.
вЂњLast
night
I
pissed
on
a
kingвЂ™s
foot,вЂќ
Osha
went
on.
вЂњMight
be
it
was
morning,
who
can
say?
I
was
sleeping,
but
now
IвЂ™m
not.вЂќ
They
all
slept
a
lot,
not
only
Bran.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
Sleep
and
eat
and
sleep
again,
and
sometimes
talk
a
littleвЂ¦
but
not
too
much,
and
only
in
whispers,
just
to
be
safe.
Osha
might
have
liked
it
better
if
they
had
never
talked
at
all,
but
there
was
no
way
to
quiet
Rickon,
or
to
stop
Hodor
from
muttering,
вЂњHodor,
hodor,
hodor,вЂќ
endlessly
to
himself.

вЂњOsha,вЂќ
Bran
said,
вЂњI
saw
Winterfell
burning.вЂќ
Off
to
his
left,
he
could
hear
the
soft
sound
of
RickonвЂ™s
breathing.

вЂњA
dream,вЂќ
said
Osha.

вЂњA
wolf
dream,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњI
smelled
it
too.
Nothing
smells
like
fire,
or
blood.вЂќ

вЂњWhose
blood?вЂќ

вЂњMen,
horses,
dogs,
everyone.
We
have
to
go
see.вЂќ

вЂњThis
scrawny
skin
of
mineвЂ™s
the
only
one
I
got,вЂќ
said
Osha.
вЂњThat
squid
prince
catches
hold
oвЂ™
me,
theyвЂ™ll
strip
it
off
my
back
with
a
whip.вЂќ

MeeraвЂ™s
hand
found
BranвЂ™s
in
the
darkness
and
gave
his
fingers
a
squeeze.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
go
if
youвЂ™re
afraid.вЂќ

Bran
heard
fingers
fumbling
at
leather,
followed
by
the
sound
of
steel
on
flint.
Then
again.
A
spark
flew,
caught.
Osha
blew
softly.
A
long
pale
flame
awoke,
stretching
upward
like
a
girl
on
her
toes.
OshaвЂ™s
face
floated
above
it.
She
touched
the
flame
with
the
head
of
a
torch.
Bran
had
to
squint
as
the
pitch
began
to
burn,
filling
the
world
with
orange
glare.
The
light
woke
Rickon,
who
sat
up
yawning.

When
the
shadows
moved,
it
looked
for
an
instant
as
if
the
dead
were
rising
as
well.
Lyanna
and
Brandon,
Lord
Rickard
Stark
their
father,
Lord
Edwyle
his
father,
Lord
Willam
and
his
brother
Artos
the
Implacable,
Lord
Donnor
and
Lord
Beron
and
Lord
Rodwell,
one-eyed
Lord
Jonnel,
Lord
Barth
and
Lord
Brandon
and
Lord
Cregan
who
had
fought
the
Dragonknight.
On
their
stone
chairs
they
sat
with
stone
wolves
at
their
feet.
This
was
where
they
came
when
the
warmth
had
seeped
out
of
their
bodies;
this
was
the
dark
hall
of
the
dead,
where
the
living
feared
to
tread.

And
in
the
mouth
of
the
empty
tomb
that
waited
for
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
beneath
his
stately
granite
likeness,
the
six
fugitives
huddled
round
their
little
cache
of
bread
and
water
and
dried
meat.
вЂњLittle
enough
left,вЂќ
Osha
muttered
as
she
blinked
down
on
their
stores.
вЂњIвЂ™d
need
to
go
up
soon
to
steal
food
in
any
case,
or
weвЂ™d
be
down
to
eating
Hodor.вЂќ

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
Hodor
said,
grinning
at
her.

вЂњIs
it
day
or
night
up
there?вЂќ
Osha
wondered.
вЂњIвЂ™ve
lost
all
count
oвЂ™
such.вЂќ

вЂњDay,вЂќ
Bran
told
her,
вЂњbut
itвЂ™s
dark
from
all
the
smoke.вЂќ

вЂњMвЂ™lord
is
certain?вЂќ

Never
moving
his
broken
body,
he
reached
out
all
the
same,
and
for
an
instant
he
was
seeing
double.
There
stood
Osha
holding
the
torch,
and
Meera
and
Jojen
and
Hodor,
and
the
double
row
of
tall
granite
pillars
and
long
dead
lords
behind
them
stretching
away
into
darknessвЂ¦
but
there
was
Winterfell
as
well,
grey
with
drifting
smoke,
the
massive
oak-and-iron
gates
charred
and
askew,
the
drawbridge
down
in
a
tangle
of
broken
chains
and
missing
planks.
Bodies
floated
in
the
moat,
islands
for
the
crows.

вЂњCertain,вЂќ
he
declared.

Osha
chewed
on
that
a
moment.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
risk
a
look
then.
I
want
the
lot
oвЂ™
you
close
behind.
Meera,
get
BranвЂ™s
basket.вЂќ

вЂњAre
we
going
home?вЂќ
Rickon
asked
excitedly.
вЂњI
want
my
horse.
And
I
want
applecakes
and
butter
and
honey,
and
Shaggy.
Are
we
going
where
Shaggydog
is?вЂќ

вЂњYes,вЂќ
Bran
promised,
вЂњbut
you
have
to
be
quiet.вЂќ

Meera
strapped
the
wicker
basket
to
HodorвЂ™s
back
and
helped
lift
Bran
into
it,
easing
his
useless
legs
through
the
holes.
He
had
a
queer
flutter
in
his
belly.
He
knew
what
awaited
them
above,
but
that
did
not
make
it
any
less
fearful.
As
they
set
off,
he
turned
to
give
his
father
one
last
look,
and
it
seemed
to
Bran
that
there
was
a
sadness
in
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
eyes,
as
if
he
did
not
want
them
to
go.
We
have
to,
he
thought.
ItвЂ™s
time.

Osha
carried
her
long
oaken
spear
in
one
hand
and
the
torch
in
the
other.
A
naked
sword
hung
down
her
back,
one
of
the
last
to
bear
MikkenвЂ™s
mark.
He
had
forged
it
for
Lord
EddardвЂ™s
tomb,
to
keep
his
ghost
at
rest.
But
with
Mikken
slain
and
the
ironmen
guarding
the
armory,
good
steel
had
been
hard
to
resist,
even
if
it
meant
grave-robbing.
Meera
had
claimed
Lord
RickardвЂ™s
blade,
though
she
complained
that
it
was
too
heavy.
Brandon
took
his
namesakeвЂ™s,
the
sword
made
for
the
uncle
he
had
never
known.
He
knew
he
would
not
be
much
use
in
a
fight,
but
even
so
the
blade
felt
good
in
his
hand.

But
it
was
only
a
game,
and
Bran
knew
it.

Their
footsteps
echoed
through
the
cavernous
crypts.
The
shadows
behind
them
swallowed
his
father
as
the
shadows
ahead
retreated
to
unveil
other
statues;
no
mere
lords,
these,
but
the
old
Kings
in
the
North.
On
their
brows
they
wore
stone
crowns.
Torrhen
Stark,
the
King
Who
Knelt.
Edwyn
the
Spring
King.
Theon
Stark,
the
Hungry
Wolf.
Brandon
the
Burner
and
Brandon
the
Shipwright.
Jorah
and
Jonos,
Brandon
the
Bad,
Walton
the
Moon
King,
Edderion
the
Bridegroom,
Eyron,
Benjen
the
Sweet
and
Benjen
the
Bitter,
King
Edrick
Snowbeard.
Their
faces
were
stern
and
strong,
and
some
of
them
had
done
terrible
things,
but
they
were
Starks
every
one,
and
Bran
knew
all
their
tales.
He
had
never
feared
the
crypts;
they
were
part
of
his
home
and
who
he
was,
and
he
had
always
known
that
one
day
he
would
lie
here
too.

But
now
he
was
not
so
certain.
If
I
go
up,
will
I
ever
come
back
down?
Where
will
I
go
when
I
die?

вЂњWait,вЂќ
Osha
said
when
they
reached
the
twisting
stone
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
surface,
and
down
to
the
deeper
levels
where
kings
more
ancient
still
sat
their
dark
thrones.
She
handed
Meera
the
torch.
вЂњIвЂ™ll
grope
my
way
up.вЂќ
For
a
time
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
footfalls,
but
they
grew
softer
and
softer
until
they
faded
away
entirely.
вЂњHodor,вЂќ
said
Hodor
nervously.

Bran
had
told
himself
a
hundred
times
how
much
he
hated
hiding
down
here
in
the
dark,
how
much
he
wanted
to
see
the
sun
again,
to
ride
his
horse
through
wind
and
rain.
But
now
that
the
moment
was
upon
him,
he
was
afraid.
HeвЂ™d
felt
safe
in
the
darkness;
when
you
could
not
even
find
your
own
hand
in
front
of
your
face,
it
was
easy
to
believe
that
no
enemies
could
ever
find
you
either.
And
the
stone
lords
had
given
him
courage.
Even
when
he
could
not
see
them,
he
had
known
they
were
there.

It
seemed
a
long
while
before
they
heard
anything
again.
Bran
had
begun
to
fear
that
something
had
happened
to
Osha.
His
brother
was
squirming
restlessly.
вЂњI
want
to
go
home!вЂќ
he
said
loudly.
Hodor
bobbed
his
head
and
said,
вЂњHodor.вЂќ
Then
they
heard
the
footsteps
again,
growing
louder,
and
after
a
few
minutes
Osha
emerged
into
the
light,
looking
grim.
вЂњSomething
is
blocking
the
door.
I
canвЂ™t
move
it.вЂќ

вЂњHodor
can
move
anything,вЂќ
said
Bran.

Osha
gave
the
huge
stableboy
an
appraising
look.
вЂњMight
be
he
can.
Come
on,
then.вЂќ

The
steps
were
narrow,
so
they
had
to
climb
in
single
file.
Osha
led.
Behind
came
Hodor,
with
Bran
crouched
low
on
his
back
so
his
head
wouldnвЂ™t
hit
the
ceiling.
Meera
followed
with
the
torch,
and
Jojen
brought
up
the
rear,
leading
Rickon
by
the
hand.
Around
and
around
they
went,
and
up
and
up.
Bran
thought
he
could
smell
smoke
now,
but
perhaps
that
was
only
the
torch.

The
door
to
the
crypts
was
made
of
ironwood.
It
was
old
and
heavy,
and
lay
at
a
slant
to
the
ground.
Only
one
person
could
approach
it
at
a
time.
Osha
tried
once
more
when
she
reached
it,
but
Bran
could
see
that
it
was
not
budging.
вЂњLet
Hodor
try.вЂќ

They
had
to
pull
Bran
from
his
basket
first,
so
he
would
not
get
squished.
Meera
squatted
beside
him
on
the
steps,
one
arm
thrown
protectively
across
his
shoulders,
as
Osha
and
Hodor
traded
places.
вЂњOpen
the
door,
Hodor,вЂќ
Bran
said.

The
huge
stableboy
put
both
hands
flat
on
the
door,
pushed,
and
grunted.
вЂњHodor?вЂќ
He
slammed
a
fist
against
the
wood,
and
it
did
not
so
much
as
jump.
вЂњHodor.вЂќ

вЂњUse
your
back,вЂќ
urged
Bran.
вЂњAnd
your
legs.вЂќ

Turning,
Hodor
put
his
back
to
the
wood
and
shoved.
Again.
Again.
вЂњHodor!вЂќ
He
put
one
foot
on
a
higher
step
so
he
was
bent
under
the
slant
of
the
door
and
tried
to
rise.
This
time
the
wood
groaned
and
creaked.
вЂњHodor!вЂќ
The
other
foot
came
up
a
step,
and
Hodor
spread
his
legs
apart,
braced,
and
straightened.
His
face
turned
red,
and
Bran
could
see
cords
in
his
neck
bulging
as
he
strained
against
the
weight
above
him.
вЂњHodor
hodor
hodor
hodor
hodor
HODOR!вЂќ
From
above
came
a
dull
rumble.
Then
suddenly
the
door
jerked
upward
and
a
shaft
of
daylight
fell
across
BranвЂ™s
face,
blinding
him
for
a
moment.
Another
shove
brought
the
sound
of
shifting
stone,
and
then
the
way
was
open.
Osha
poked
her
spear
through
and
slid
out
after
it,
and
Rickon
squirmed
through
MeeraвЂ™s
legs
to
follow.
Hodor
shoved
the
door
open
all
the
way
and
stepped
to
the
surface.
The
Reeds
had
to
carry
Bran
up
the
last
few
steps.

The
sky
was
a
pale
grey,
and
smoke
eddied
all
around
them.
They
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
First
Keep,
or
what
remained
of
it.
One
whole
side
of
the
building
had
torn
loose
and
fallen
away.
Stone
and
shattered
gargoyles
lay
strewn
across
the
yard.
They
fell
just
where
I
did,
Bran
thought
when
he
saw
them.
Some
of
the
gargoyles
had
broken
into
so
many
pieces
it
made
him
wonder
how
he
was
alive
at
all.
Nearby
some
crows
were
pecking
at
a
body
crushed
beneath
the
tumbled
stone,
but
he
lay
facedown
and
Bran
could
not
say
who
he
was.

The
First
Keep
had
not
been
used
for
many
hundreds
of
years,
but
now
it
was
more
of
a
shell
than
ever.
The
floors
had
burned
inside
it,
and
all
the
beams.
Where
the
wall
had
fallen
away,
they
could
see
right
into
the
rooms,
even
into
the
privy.
Yet
behind,
the
broken
tower
still
stood,
no
more
burned
than
before.
Jojen
Reed
was
coughing
from
the
smoke.
вЂњTake
me
home!вЂќ
Rickon
demanded.
вЂњI
want
to
be
home!вЂќ
Hodor
stomped
in
a
circle.
вЂњHodor,вЂќ
he
whimpered
in
a
small
voice.
They
stood
huddled
together
with
ruin
and
death
all
around
them.

вЂњWe
made
noise
enough
to
wake
a
dragon,вЂќ
Osha
said,
вЂњbut
thereвЂ™s
no
one
come.
The
castleвЂ™s
dead
and
burned,
just
as
Bran
dreamed,
but
we
had
bestвЂ”вЂќ
She
broke
off
suddenly
at
a
noise
behind
them,
and
whirled
with
her
spear
at
the
ready.

Two
lean
dark
shapes
emerged
from
behind
the
broken
tower,
padding
slowly
through
the
rubble.
Rickon
gave
a
happy
shout
of
вЂњShaggy!вЂќ
and
the
black
direwolf
came
bounding
toward
him.
Summer
advanced
more
slowly,
rubbed
his
head
up
against
BranвЂ™s
arm,
and
licked
his
face.

вЂњWe
should
go,вЂќ
said
Jojen.
вЂњSo
much
death
will
bring
other
wolves
besides
Summer
and
Shaggydog,
and
not
all
on
four
feet.вЂќ

вЂњAye,
soon
enough,вЂќ
Osha
agreed,
вЂњbut
we
need
food,
and
there
may
be
some
survived
this,
Stay
together.
Meera,
keep
your
shield
up
and
guard
our
backs.вЂќ

It
took
the
rest
of
the
morning
to
make
a
slow
circuit
of
the
castle.
The
great
granite
walls
remained,
blackened
here
and
there
by
fire
but
otherwise
untouched.
But
within,
all
was
death
and
destruction.
The
doors
of
the
Great
Hall
were
charred
and
smoldering,
and
inside
the
rafters
had
given
way
and
the
whole
roof
had
crashed
down
onto
the
floor.
The
green
and
yellow
panes
of
the
glass
gardens
were
all
in
shards,
the
trees
and
fruits
and
flowers
torn
up
or
left
exposed
to
die.
Of
the
stables,
made
of
wood
and
thatch,
nothing
remained
but
ashes,
embers,
and
dead
horses.
Bran
thought
of
his
Dancer,
and
wanted
to
weep.
There
was
a
shallow
steaming
lake
beneath
the
Library
Tower,
and
hot
water
gushing
from
a
crack
in
its
side.
The
bridge
between
the
Bell
Tower
and
the
rookery
had
collapsed
into
the
yard
below,
and
Maester
LuwinвЂ™s
turret
was
gone.
They
saw
a
dull
red
glow
shining
up
through
the
narrow
cellar
windows
beneath
the
Great
Keep,
and
a
second
fire
still
burning
in
one
of
the
storehouses.

Osha
called
softly
through
the
blowing
smoke
as
they
went,
but
no
one
answered.
They
saw
one
dog
worrying
at
a
corpse,
but
he
ran
when
he
caught
the
scents
of
the
direwolves;
the
rest
had
been
slain
in
the
kennels.
The
maesterвЂ™s
ravens
were
paying
court
to
some
of
the
corpses,
while
the
crows
from
the
broken
tower
attended
others.
Bran
recognized
Poxy
Tym,
even
though
someone
had
taken
an
axe
to
his
face.
One
charred
corpse,
outside
the
ashen
shell
of
MotherвЂ™s
sept,
sat
with
his
arms
drawn
up
and
his
hands
balled
into
hard
black
fists,
as
if
to
punch
anyone
who
dared
approach
him.
вЂњIf
the
gods
are
good,вЂќ
Osha
said
in
a
low
angry
voice,
вЂњthe
Others
will
take
them
that
did
this
work.вЂќ

вЂњIt
was
Theon,вЂќ
Bran
said
blackly.

вЂњNo.
Look.вЂќ
She
pointed
across
the
yard
with
her
spear.
вЂњThatвЂ™s
one
of
his
ironmen.
And
there.
And
thatвЂ™s
GreyjoyвЂ™s
warhorse,
see?
The
black
one
with
the
arrows
in
him.вЂќ
She
moved
among
the
dead,
frowning.
вЂњAnd
hereвЂ™s
Black
Lorren.вЂќ
He
had
been
hacked
and
cut
so
badly
that
his
beard
looked
a
reddish-brown
now.
вЂњTook
a
few
with
him,
he
did.вЂќ
Osha
turned
over
one
of
the
other
corpses
with
her
foot.
вЂњThereвЂ™s
a
badge.
A
little
man,
all
red.вЂќ

вЂњThe
flayed
man
of
the
Dreadfort,вЂќ
said
Bran.

Summer
howled,
and
darted
away.

вЂњThe
godswood.вЂќ
Meera
Reed
ran
after
the
direwolf,
her
shield
and
frog
spear
to
hand.
The
rest
of
them
trailed
after,
threading
their
way
through
smoke
and
fallen
stones.
The
air
was
sweeter
under
the
trees.
A
few
pines
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
had
been
scorched,
but
deeper
in
the
damp
soil
and
green
wood
had
defeated
the
flames.
вЂњThere
is
a
power
in
living
wood,вЂќ
said
Jojen
Reed,
almost
as
if
he
knew
what
Bran
was
thinking,
вЂњa
power
strong
as
fire.вЂќ

On
the
edge
of
the
black
pool,
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
heart
tree,
Maester
Luwin
lay
on
his
belly
in
the
dirt.
A
trail
of
blood
twisted
back
through
damp
leaves
where
he
had
crawled.
Summer
stood
over
him,
and
Bran
thought
he
was
dead
at
first,
but
when
Meera
touched
his
throat,
the
maester
moaned.
вЂњHodor?вЂќ
Hodor
said
mournfully.
вЂњHodor?вЂќ

Gently,
they
eased
Luwin
onto
his
back.
He
had
grey
eyes
and
grey
hair,
and
once
his
robes
had
been
grey
as
well,
but
they
were
darker
now
where
the
blood
had
soaked
through.
вЂњBran,вЂќ
he
said
softly
when
he
saw
him
sitting
tall
on
HodorвЂ™s
back.
вЂњAnd
Rickon
too.вЂќ
He
smiled.
вЂњThe
gods
are
good.
I
knewвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњKnew?вЂќ
said
Bran
uncertainly.

вЂњThe
legs,
I
could
tellвЂ¦
the
clothes
fit,
but
the
muscles
in
his
legsвЂ¦
poor
ladвЂ¦вЂќ
He
coughed,
and
blood
came
up
from
inside
him.
вЂњYou
vanishedвЂ¦
in
the
woodsвЂ¦
how,
though?вЂќ

вЂњWe
never
went,вЂќ
said
Bran.
вЂњWell,
only
to
the
edge,
and
then
doubled
back.
I
sent
the
wolves
on
to
make
a
trail,
but
we
hid
in
FatherвЂ™s
tomb.вЂќ

вЂњThe
crypts.вЂќ
Luwin
chuckled,
a
froth
of
blood
on
his
lips.
When
the
maester
tried
to
move,
he
gave
a
sharp
gasp
of
pain.

Tears
filled
BranвЂ™s
eyes.
When
a
man
was
hurt
you
took
him
to
the
maester,
but
what
could
you
do
when
your
maester
was
hurt?

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
need
to
make
a
litter
to
carry
him,вЂќ
said
Osha.

вЂњNo
use,вЂќ
said
Luwin.
вЂњIвЂ™m
dying,
woman.вЂќ

вЂњYou
canвЂ™t,вЂќ
said
Rickon
angrily.
вЂњNo
you
canвЂ™t.вЂќ
Beside
him,
Shaggydog
bared
his
teeth
and
growled.

The
maester
smiled.
вЂњHush
now,
child,
IвЂ™m
much
older
than
you.
I
canвЂ¦
die
as
I
please.вЂќ

вЂњHodor,
down,вЂќ
said
Bran.
Hodor
went
to
his
knees
beside
the
maester.

вЂњListen,вЂќ
Luwin
said
to
Osha,
вЂњthe
princesвЂ¦
RobbвЂ™s
heirs.
NotвЂ¦
not
togetherвЂ¦
do
you
hear?вЂќ

The
wildling
woman
leaned
on
her
spear.
вЂњAye.
Safer
apart.
But
where
to
take
them?
IвЂ™d
thought,
might
be
these
CerwynsвЂ¦вЂќ

Maester
Luwin
shook
his
head,
though
it
was
plain
to
see
what
the
effort
cost
him.
вЂњCerwyn
boyвЂ™s
dead.
Ser
Rodrik,
Leobald
Tallhart,
Lady
HornwoodвЂ¦
all
slain.
Deepwood
fallen,
Moat
Cailin,
soon
TorrhenвЂ™s
Square.
Ironmen
on
the
Stony
Shore.
And
east,
the
Bastard
of
Bolton.вЂќ

вЂњThen
where?вЂќ
asked
Osha.

вЂњWhite
HarborвЂ¦
the
UmbersвЂ¦
I
do
not
knowвЂ¦
war
everywhereвЂ¦
each
man
against
his
neighbor,
and
winter
comingвЂ¦
such
folly,
such
black
mad
follyвЂ¦вЂќ
Maester
Luwin
reached
up
and
grasped
BranвЂ™s
forearm,
his
fingers
closing
with
a
desperate
strength.
вЂњYou
must
be
strong
now.
Strong.вЂќ

вЂњI
will
be,вЂќ
Bran
said,
though
it
was
hard.
Ser
Rodrik
killed
and
Maester
Luwin,
everyone,
everyoneвЂ¦

вЂњGood,вЂќ
the
maester
said.
вЂњA
good
boy.
YourвЂ¦
your
fatherвЂ™s
son,
Bran.
Now
go.вЂќ

Osha
gazed
up
at
the
weirwood,
at
the
red
face
carved
in
the
pale
trunk.
вЂњAnd
leave
you
for
the
gods?вЂќ

вЂњI
begвЂ¦вЂќ
The
maester
swallowed.
вЂњAвЂ¦
a
drink
of
water,
andвЂ¦
another
boon.
If
you
wouldвЂ¦вЂќ

вЂњAye.вЂќ
She
turned
to
Meera.
вЂњTake
the
boys.вЂќ

Jojen
and
Meera
led
Rickon
out
between
them.
Hodor
followed.
Low
branches
whipped
at
BranвЂ™s
face
as
they
pushed
between
the
trees,
and
the
leaves
brushed
away
his
tears.
Osha
joined
them
in
the
yard
a
few
moments
later.
She
said
no
word
of
Maester
Luwin.
вЂњHodor
must
stay
with
Bran,
to
be
his
legs,вЂќ
the
wildling
woman
said
briskly.
вЂњI
will
take
Rickon
with
me.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
go
with
Bran,вЂќ
said
Jojen
Reed.

вЂњAye,
I
thought
you
might,вЂќ
said
Osha.
вЂњBelieve
IвЂ™ll
try
the
East
Gate,
and
follow
the
kingsroad
a
ways.вЂќ

вЂњWeвЂ™ll
take
the
HunterвЂ™s
Gate,вЂќ
said
Meera.

вЂњHodor,вЂќ
said
Hodor.

They
stopped
at
the
kitchens
first.
Osha
found
some
loaves
of
burned
bread
that
were
still
edible,
and
even
a
cold
roast
fowl
that
she
ripped
in
half.
Meera
unearthed
a
crock
of
honey
and
a
big
sack
of
apples.
Outside,
they
made
their
farewells.
Rickon
sobbed
and
clung
to
HodorвЂ™s
leg
until
Osha
gave
him
a
smack
with
the
butt
end
of
her
spear.
Then
he
followed
her
quick
enough.
Shaggydog
stalked
after
them.
The
last
Bran
saw
of
them
was
the
direwolfвЂ™s
tail
as
it
vanished
behind
the
broken
tower.

The
iron
portcullis
that
closed
the
HunterвЂ™s
Gate
had
been
warped
so
badly
by
heat
it
could
not
be
raised
more
than
a
foot.
They
had
to
squeeze
beneath
its
spikes,
one
by
one.

вЂњWill
we
go
to
your
lord
father?вЂќ
Bran
asked
as
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
between
the
walls.
вЂњTo
Greywater
Watch?вЂќ

Meera
looked
to
her
brother
for
the
answer.
вЂњOur
road
is
north,вЂќ
Jojen
announced.

At
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood,
Bran
turned
in
his
basket
for
one
last
glimpse
of
the
castle
that
had
been
his
life.
Wisps
of
smoke
still
rose
into
the
grey
sky,
but
no
more
than
might
have
risen
from
WinterfellвЂ™s
chimneys
on
a
cold
autumn
afternoon.
Soot
stains
marked
some
of
the
arrow
loops,
and
here
and
there
a
crack
or
a
missing
merlon
could
be
seen
in
the
curtain
wall,
but
it
seemed
little
enough
from
this
distance.
Beyond,
the
tops
of
the
keeps
and
towers
still
stood
as
they
had
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
it
was
hard
to
tell
that
the
castle
had
been
sacked
and
burned
at
all.
The
stone
is
strong,
Bran
told
himself,
the
roots
of
the
trees
go
deep,
and
under
the
ground
the
Kings
of
Winter
sit
their
thrones.
So
long
as
those
remained,
Winterfell
remained.
It
was
not
dead,
just
broken.
Like
me,
he
thought.
IвЂ™m
not
dead
either.

Lord

agreed

in

only
after

agreed
to

promising
to
marry
one
of

or

after

was
done.

only

took
