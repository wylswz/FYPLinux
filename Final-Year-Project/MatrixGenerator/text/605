articles out of baseball options theres always zurich           zurich   in       a group of swiss kids fixated on rockabilly music  muscle cars and other americana  that   s when a couple of them thought it would be a great idea to start playing baseball in a country famous mostly for utility knives and yodeling one of these youngsters   donato resta  who grew up in zurich  stole his dad   s hockey pads to serve as catcher   s gear  two other zurich locals had gloves  a pair of bats were also mustered  recalled mr  resta  but only one was serviceable  the other    was a little league bat     mr  resta said recently     so we couldn   t use it    more than three decades later  despite a stubbornly low level of local talent  switzerland has now concluded its   th year of organized baseball  along the way  it has grown into a welcome option for unproven amateurs from abroad and fading veterans in search of one last season of glory switzerland is the place to go    when you can   t play anywhere else     said  eduardo villacis  a pitcher who started one game in the major leagues for the kansas city royals  lasting less than four innings at the old yankee stadium  where he was credited with the loss  by the time mr  villacis     years old  arrived in switzerland in       he had a fading career and battered arm  but the drop off in competition meant he could still enjoy blowing hitters away  he earned the equivalent of        a month that season from the bern cardinals  in europe  a continent that has never really taken to the sport  the top baseball powers are the netherlands and italy  then there are places like germany and the czech republic  finally  there   s a bottom tier of european leagues  anchored by switzerland on that lower rung  switzerland is distinguished by local talent ranked   th in the world by the sport   s international governing body  that   s    slots behind great britain     behind sweden  dozens of other countries tie for the bottom of the list  which ends at      chris palatinus  now an official with the swiss baseball   softball federation  fell for baseball after seeing games broadcast in zurich on a german tv station  diehards like him can have a lonely existence in a country where soccer dominates  and most baseball equipment is only available online    up until two years ago we had a swiss retailer who was specialized in american sports     mr  palatinus said     but he quit    swiss rules mandate that only two foreign ringers can be on the field for a team at the same time  tapping this talent pool bolsters the league and is a boon for local players   michael stowers  a    year old from san diego  is one such import  playing for the therwil flyers  near basel  he had a      batting average in the regular season this year  no one has hit over      in a major league season since       when  ted williams did it  mr  stowers  who was paid a monthly salary equivalent to roughly       said the back to basics element of the swiss game is appealing    gosh  you know  in the states they hound you in practices and games  and you almost forget the fun of baseball      werner zingg  who with mr  resta was a founding father of swiss baseball  used to go on scouting trips abroad  the local talent level is improving  he said  the top swiss league has eight teams  some are in small towns like therwil  or sissach  home of the frogs   two are in zurich  which has the only regulation ballpark in the country  admission there is free  an august game between therwil and the zurich barracudas drew about a dozen spectators as the first inning got underway  locals wandering by occasionally stopped  and stared quizzically at the action mike settle  a    year old texan who has played several seasons in switzerland  said some locals could compete in better leagues  in many cases  though  their hitting and throwing motions betray them     even if they   re not uncomfortable  they look uncomfortable     mr  settle said improvised fields  squeezed into areas meant for soccer or other sports  are a hallmark of the league  in therwil  near basel  the flyers play in a park where the center field fence ended up about     feet from home plate  a standard distance is closer to     feet   to protect parked cars  they erected a roughly    foot tall barrier in center  on the other side of a running track the odd set up means passersby unwittingly wander onto the field during games  said mr  palatinus     umpires regularly have to chase away bystanders    mr  zingg umpired the game in november        between mr  resta   s zurich team and a lucerne team  which gave birth to organized baseball in switzerland  the contest was called due to snow     we had to stop in the third inning     mr  zingg said  but enough interest was generated to form a league the following year the zurich team  which took the name challengers  recently lost a post season series against therwil  the lucerne team  originally called the white sox  eventually changed its name to the eagles  the zurich barracudas  which mr  resta also co founded  lost to therwil in a championship series mr  resta now runs a company that does international baseball scouting  he and some of the other pioneers are less than thrilled with how the swiss game has developed     such a rich country  and nothing is going on     mr  resta said that   s not entirely true  baseball   s world governing body  the world baseball softball confederation  has its headquarters in the swiss city lausanne     people say why are you in lausanne  there   s not even a  regulation  baseball field in lausanne     wbsc executive director  michael schmidt reflected during a recent chat  like other international sports organizations  the wbsc wanted to be close to the lausanne based international olympic committee   mr  schmidt  who is not mike schmidt  the philadelphia phillies third baseman inducted into the hall of fame in        said he   s aware of the local baseball team  the lausanne indians he said he hasn   t been to a game  write to john letzing at john letzing wsj com
