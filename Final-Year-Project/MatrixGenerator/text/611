       and his wife  naomi  dreamed of running a business in france even before opening their first wine shop in london in       in       with five bottle apostle outlets across the u k  capital  the eakins began searching for a ch  teau to call their own with the help of a local vineyard acquisition adviser  the eakins found their dream property  in the small town of berson on the right bank of the gironde river     acre ch  teau puynard is less than an hour away from an airport and the city of bordeaux  and within walking distance of amenities such as a butcher and a boulangerie  it sits on one contiguous plot of land   in bordeaux  some vineyards    land holdings are scattered   and it fit into the couple   s budget  which topped out at      million as is often the case  ch  teau puynard also came with two longtime vineyard staff members mr  eakin      concluded the staff was a benefit  based on the intentions of the prior owners  who were relocating to their recently purchased grand cru estate     their attitude was     if you don   t keep them  we   ll take them with us     so i said     these guys must know what they   re doing       to help smooth the transition  mr  eakin says he has made sure to work with the staff   including late nights and early mornings   whenever he is on the property  this month marks his first harvest  the busiest time of year  and he stayed on for most of the process  mr  eakin declined to discuss wages  but said they were in line with what the previous owners paid  and that he gave the second member of his team   who had previously been part time   a full time contract  which brings with it more employment benefits  because mr  eakin isn   t fluent in french  he also employs two additional french speakers  an office manager and a wine consultant  who help him communicate with staff  while owners say a staff is essential for harvest and production  worker wages definitely add to the bill  a rule of thumb is that an owner would employ one person for every    acres of vines  says
