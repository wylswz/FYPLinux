 was minting money from having joined forces with marvel entertainment  warner bros  would do the same with its dc comics properties     batman v superman    proved to be exceedingly dark  with relentless battles fought on rain swept streets  and its debut was met with cool to hostile responses from fans and critics alike   i called it    underdeveloped  overlong and stupendously dispiriting      once you   ve seen    suicide squad     though     batman v superman    seems like the superhero equivalent of    singin    in the rain    the film is formulaic  another variant of    the dirty dozen      put together a team of bad guys that can outdo the enemy in extravagant badness  on this occasion the team is assembled by  amanda waller  a glum u s  intelligence officer played joylessly by  viola davis  amanda wants to have a plan  she explains     if the next superman turns out to be a terrorist     to that end she recruits the curdled cr  me de la cr  me of dc supervillains  including deadshot  will smith   harley quinn  margot robbie   killer croc   adewale akinnuoye agbaje   and a new incarnation of the joker  played by  jared leto  who disappears for long stretches of the grindingly violent and sporadically incoherent action   a grim faced  ben affleck also shows up for a brief  uncredited turn as batman  if any of that sounds like summer fun  it isn   t  most of the first hour is devoted to scene setting during which the supervillains brag  preen  threaten  brawl among themselves  endure abuse at the hands of their captors and handlers  and experience recurrent flashbacks that explain who they are and why they behave so badly   diablo  a human flamethrower played by  jay hernandez  is something of a pacifist     i   m a man  not a weapon     he insists   and there   s no fun to be had after the rudiments of a plot finally kick in  most of the second hour is devoted to repetitive battles with the forces of the enchantress  a villainess who  far from being the next superman  turns out to be a generic cgi entity with no detectable personality when casting for    suicide squad    was announced  the big draw for me was the prospect of margot robbie in a starring role  and she certainly brought a bent grace note to the trailers as a seductively lascivious  post adolescent lolita with twinkly eyes and cute pigtails  but the writer director of this leaden production   david ayer  has no gift for comedy  or comic timing  so ms  robbie   s harley  like everyone else on screen  is an essentially humorless brute     this is just a whole lotta pretty and a whole lotta crazy     a prison guard says by way of summing her up  harley   s main distinction  apart from her lurid sexuality  is a baseball bat with which she beats up on hapless adversaries so far i may seem to be describing just another in a decades long string of studio productions that beat up  in their turn  on moviegoers who know perfectly well what they   re buying into and usually enjoy it  but    suicide squad    differs in intensity and consistency  if not in kind  it   s an expansion of the intractably bleak aesthetic that informed    batman v superman     a vision of humanity dominated by heavy weaponry a case can be made for the movie being a good fit with the mood of the moment in what passes for real life  if that   s true  we   re all in deeper trouble than we know  and audiences may well embrace the incessant mayhem in lieu of entertainment  but a stronger case can be made for    suicide squad    as a product of shameless pandering     got me a sewer to crawl back into     says killer croc with lizardly satisfaction toward the end  he   s got nothing on the movie  which was in the sewer all along to give uncredit where it   s due  margot robbie   s uncredited appearance   sipping champagne in a bubble bath while explaining subprime mortgages   did more for this film than her starring role does for    suicide squad      adam mckay directed from a script he wrote with  charles randolph  the cast includes  christian bale  steve carell  ryan gosling and  brad pitt     the big short    has all the energy of    the wolf of wall street    plus a coherent point of view that the earlier film lacked  write to joe morgenstern at joe morgenstern wsj com
