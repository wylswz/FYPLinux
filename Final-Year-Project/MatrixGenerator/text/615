articles the battle of brooklyn review victory through retreat            new york ask most americans about the battle of brooklyn and you   ll likely get a blank stare  the new york historical society is trying to change that  marking the    th anniversary with a new exhibit that uses artifacts  letters  diaries  maps  works of art and dioramas to make the point that it was perhaps the most important military engagement of the american revolutionary war   the battle of brooklyn    new york historical society   through jan           sometimes known as the battle of long island  most of the fighting took place aug               less than two months after the continental congress declared independence from britain  it was not only the first major battle of the war  but also the largest  the exact numbers are lost to history  but it pitted some        british troops  including       hessian mercenaries and more than     british ships  against       continental army soldiers under gen   george washington  while it could just as easily be called    the retreat of brooklyn     the battle demonstrated washington   s superior tactical sense in the way he escaped a numerically superior  more well trained force that had him nearly surrounded  if he had failed  the rebellion would have ended there the more than     objects smartly chosen by curators  valerie paley and jean ashton are displayed chronologically in a half dozen small galleries  early on  visitors see a wall size map of the    colonies  with new york at the center  and a prescient pull quote from a jan           letter from  john adams to washington  saying that new york is    key to the whole continent        no effort to secure it ought to be omitted     nearby is the letter itself  on loan from the library of congress visitors next get a sense of the mood in new york  a city of        people sharply divided between revolutionaries and loyalists in the summer of          from the battery at the foot of manhattan     one placard notes     new yorkers could see hundreds of ship masts   a terrifying sight to civilians and soldiers    washington issued a broadside  on display here  telling residents to expect the worst and leave the city if they could  on july    shortly after the first public reading of the declaration of independence  an angry mob went to bowling green  a public square in lower manhattan  and pulled down a gilded lead statue of george iii on horseback  some of the lead  legend has it  was melted down to make musket balls  the event is depicted in an     s oil painting by johannes adam simon oertel  part of the museum   s permanent collection the most impressive pre battle artifact is a small pocket almanac kept by an unknown citizen  on the page for july   he noted that independence had been declared and then wrote    this fatal day  rivers of blood will flow    they wouldn   t flow until late august  when british troops landed in gravesend and were given a hero   s welcome by local loyalists  who would guide them through passes to flank washington  but before visitors learn the details of the battle  they   re shown period weapons and uniforms  as well as the actual canvas cot that washington slept on the battle itself is explained through a knee high  tabletop video display  showing a map of brooklyn and both sides    troop movements over the three days of fighting  when the british get to the vechte farmhouse  today called the old stone house and reconstructed in brooklyn   s park slope neighborhood  the map disappears and we see under clear glass a scale model of the farmhouse  with miniature british and american troops amassed around it  it   s a clever use of modern technology to show a key point in the battle  if not for the valiant stand of    the maryland        the bulk of washington   s force might not have been able to escape to brooklyn heights  from there  he wisely decided to retreat to manhattan under the cover of darkness and fog on the night of aug      the exhibit notes that washington   s troops were ferried to safety by gen   john glover and his marbleheaders  a group of racially integrated fishermen from massachusetts  when the fog lifted on the morning of aug      the continental army was gone  some       american men were killed  wounded or captured  while the british casualties and prisoners numbered just under     the british subsequently moved into new york and occupied it for the next seven years  the city was burned   perhaps by  nathan hale  who was hanged for treason   a calamity seen here in an engraving of  franz xaver habermann   s depiction of the blaze  washington had clearly been defeated  but the continental army survived to more famously cross the delaware and surprise those same british troops some four months later on christmas eve  that makes the battle of brooklyn a story well worth remembering  and one that is told well here  mr  yost is a writer in
