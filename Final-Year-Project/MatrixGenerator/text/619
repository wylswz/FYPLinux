articles sheryl sandberg women are leaning inbut they face pushback           a freelance film director recently described walking into a negotiation  she was ready  she had armed herself with stats and evidence and had practiced her pitch  but instead of diving into why she deserved the project   and the money that came along with it   she began with the following     i just want to say up front that i   m going to negotiate  and the research shows that you   re going to like me less when i do    she could see the wheels turning in the minds of her colleagues  but she was right  when women ask for what they deserve  they often face social pushback   and are viewed as    bossy    or    aggressive    simply for asking  so she came up with a solution  call out the bias before it could surface  it worked the    too aggressive    penalty is just one of the findings from women in the workplace       a study by leanin org and mckinsey   co  being released today  based on a survey of     companies employing more than     million people  the study is  to our knowledge  the most comprehensive annual review of women in corporate america  last year   s report concluded that we were     years away from gender equality in the c suite  a year later  we   re not much closer   and that is not just bad for women  it   s bad for our companies and our economy  women are still underrepresented at every corporate level and hold less than     of roles in senior management  and women hit the glass ceiling early  they are far less likely than men to be promoted from entry level to manager  and they continue to lose ground incrementally the more senior they become  this gap in female leadership is not due to attrition  in fact  women and men are leaving their companies at about the same rate as one might expect  these challenges are more pronounced for women of color  they make up the most underrepresented group in the corporate pipeline and experience the deepest drop offs in middle and senior management   despite the fact that women of color are more likely than white women to say they want to be top executives  there is some encouraging news  women are now negotiating for raises and promotions as often as their male peers   defying the conventional wisdom that women don   t ask  perhaps not surprisingly  women who ask for a promotion are far more likely to get one than women who don   t  however  women still aren   t faring as well as men  on average  they are less likely to be promoted of course  the challenge is how to break down the stereotypes that cause people to dislike women when they make that ask  women who negotiate are     more likely than women who don   t to receive feedback that their personal style is    intimidating        too aggressive     or    bossy     and they are more likely to receive that kind of feedback than men who negotiate  the reason for this pushback lies in many of the unconscious assumptions we all hold about women and men  we expect men to be assertive  look out for themselves  and lobby for more   so there   s little downside when they do it  but women must be communal and collaborative  nurturing and giving  focused on the team and not themselves  lest they be viewed as self absorbed  so when a woman advocates for herself  people often see her unfavorably the problem isn   t just in the asking  women face an uphill battle right from the start  they have less access to senior level sponsors and get less feedback on their performance  despite asking for it as frequently as men  women in our survey are more likely to say that they don   t receive challenging assignments and that they struggle with being recognized for their ideas and contributions  so not surprisingly  women are almost three times as likely as men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise  promotion or chance to get ahead these things matter   not just for women  but for us all  research shows that gender equality is as good for business as it is for individuals  diverse teams and companies produce better results and higher revenue and profits  which lead to more opportunity for everyone  not just women we believe that leaders want to do what   s right   and it   s heartening to see so many companies choosing to participate in this study  seventy eight percent of them report that gender diversity is a top    priority for their ceo  but while companies are highly committed to solving the problem  they are struggling to put their commitment into practice  only half of managers say they know what to do to improve gender diversity  and only a quarter of employees report that their managers frequently challenge biased language or behavior when it happens  although     of companies report they use clear criteria for hiring and promotions  only     of employees say this is true in practice this report is a reminder  yet again  of how much is left to do  there are steps that companies can take right now  starting with measuring progress  although most companies track the gender breakdown of their hiring and promotions  fewer than     set targets   and it   s harder to make progress when you don   t have clear goals in place companies also need to make a stronger case for gender diversity  explaining why it matters and how it benefits everyone  they can invest in gender bias training   especially for managers  who make many of the decisions that affect women   s daily work experience and career progression  companies can also encourage everyone  from entry level employees to leaders  to talk openly about gender stereotypes and provide women with more leadership opportunities  access to sponsors  and recognition for their contributions  and all of us can encourage women to keep negotiating   until the day that it   s seen as perfectly normal  and even expected  for women to ask for more more women are leaning in   and we   ll all go farther when the workplace stops pushing back    ms  sandberg is the chief operating officer of facebook inc  and the founder of leanin org  rachel thomas  president of lean in  contributed to this essay
