hi lisa i   m not one to write responses  never have in fact  maybe i   m anti social to a point  but it was one feature of medium that never thrilled me because i knew i   d use it rarely  i know people love it  and it is fascinating to see conversations spiral out  but lately  they are all over the place my relationship with medium has been a little strained  it all started when i went for a trip to the himalayas  the    days of disconnect broke something  maybe i moved on  maybe medium did  i don   t know i   ve been reading your view about the shift of the medium vibe  i agree with you  there is something off about the place  it   s still medium  the people who write still write  the platform is good  but the sheen of the white page is somewhere lost i had several roles on medium  a reader  a writer  and an editor for the coffeelicious  many have complained that the feed never displayed good stories for them  or always showed life hacks  the kind that get boring real fast  i never had that complaint  because if my feed didn   t capture me  i   d stray to the coffeelicious submission pile and that place could keep me well fed for months  but lately  even the coffeelicious feed isn   t as entertaining  it   s not that the writers aren   t writing amazing stuff  they are  it isn   t as fun as before i can put most of the blame for my disconnect with medium on myself  my professional life has seen an increased dose of activity as i juggle between a job  a new startup job  without pay   a literary agent who sees poetntial in my work  i somehow scrape out   hours a day to write         because if i don   t do that  everything else will suffer  and the late night novel readings don   t help  and in all this  medium and especially coffeelicious takes a hit  the creme results haven   t been declared  i don   t even know when that   ll be possible  we don   t feel the repsonse we   d hoped to get there was a time when i used to sit everyday for an hour or two  editing stories  replying to email submissions  happily  lately  i don   t remember when was the last time i opened the coffeelicious email to check  these things eat at me  but i can   t help drop a few balls as i juggle so many in a day  prioritization based on immediate work is a bitch like you  i   m still here in the background  waiting  watching  reading  hoping things get better with time  medium is an amazing platform  an engaging one  i hate seeing it this way  and i hate being away from it i wish i was in college  i   d have the time to take care of this  i   d step up  round up the writers and take a stand  but growing up has made me realize how importatnt time is and somethings need to be left behind in order for you to move further  i hope  for me  medium is not one of those writes on heavy paper and uses the light ones to make paper planes  ink stained editor  tcoffeelici
