 world over christmas or the taj mahal any day of the year  but i was still determined to see it  a filmmaker friend who   d recently scouted a documentary on petra suggested a local tour operator   hosni mayoof  who could help me avoid the crowds     leave it to me  my friend     hosni said when i called him and mentioned my concern  as it turned out  petra has far fewer tourists nowadays than i could have imagined the prize possession of a country bordered on all sides by some tough neighbors   syria  iraq  saudi arabia and israel   petra suffers by association  skittish travelers wary of violence in the middle east are choosing to bypass jordan altogether and vacation elsewhere  according to jordan   s ministry of tourism  visitor numbers to petra dropped by     last year from      levels  when more than         sightseers toured the    acre archaeological park and other nearby ruins a steeper drop was reported for the first three months of       just how risky is jordan  opinions vary  not surprisingly  but when  last week  i asked emile a  nakhleh  a middle east security expert and member of the council on foreign relations  about the situation in jordan  he said     although there is some terrorist threat  it is highly localized on the syrian and iraqi borders only     the national security services are very present  in jordan   s tourist areas   i wouldn   t hesitate to go to petra or wadi rum     a sharp downturn in tourism has its upsides for travelers  in wadi musa  the    new    town that abuts the archaeological park  the m  venpick resort  considered the finest hotel in the area and just across from petra   s visitor center  seemed half full when i checked in  nightly room rates were as low as      escorted by hosni  i entered the park on foot   as most visitors do   following the trail that leads from the visitor center through a mile long slot canyon that snakes between sandstone walls rising some     feet high  with an entryway as well concealed as that  no wonder petra was    lost    for centuries  at least to europeans  it wasn   t until the early     s that a young swiss explorer  following a tip about a    lost city of rock     snooped his way through the gorge and then sent word back home of his wild discovery  as we turned the last corner  petra   s most famous building  the treasury  suddenly came into view  delicately sculpted from the red rock cliffs  with classical columns and cornices  it looks like a storybook palace or a movie set   which it was  for    indiana jones and the last crusade     among others 
   if petra is reminiscent of    indiana jones     wadi rum evokes    lawrence of arabia       
like most of petra  the treasury was built by an arab tribe known as the nabataeans  who began erecting the city as early as     b c  beside the treasury runs the so called street of facades  bordered by a cliff face lined with the nabataeans    houses and tombs  these days  the street serves as the core of petra  where trinket sellers and camel drivers offer their wares to the smattering of small tour groups  inspired by the adventurers who came before me   real and fictional   i left hosni chatting with a few tea vendors and went on my own to explore some of the     or so niches and caves perched above the main road    in its golden age        years ago  many thousands lived here     sheik raja alnawafleh told me when we met the next day  the sheik  who owns the alanbat hotel in wadi musa  is the chief of a large bedouin tribe who lives in the region     our tribe is very old     he said     but the nabataeans were even earlier   they built  dams and channels and carved steps to the mountaintops  they were rich from the taxes of passing spice  incense and silk caravans  they built their capital with that money    after i rejoined hosni  we walked to the massive monastery  another of the site   s star attractions  and then hosni suggested we take a    secret    trail to little petra  nearby ruins that look like a miniaturized version of the bigger complex  with smaller tombs and temples  we walked   miles along a ridge above petra  never passing another soul  at the highest point  we stopped to enjoy the view of the rugged wadi araba and israel   s desert  no more than   miles away the day after i toured petra  one of hosni   s drivers drove me to a desert camp     minutes away in wadi rum  where i   d spend the night  if petra is reminiscent of the indiana jones movies  wadi rum  a vast wilderness of wind ruffled sand and sandstone islands  evokes     lawrence of arabia      t e  lawrence  the larger than life british officer  visited the region frequently  and many scenes from the      film were shot there  sun city camp  one of wadi rum   s handful of bedouin style camps designed for tourists  is a grid of lamb s wool tents connected by wooden walkways built above the sand  soon after arriving  i climbed into a  x  pickup with a local bedouin guide   mosa alrawajfih  who drove me deep into the desert  where the sands sparkled creamy white in sections  then deep pink  then a vermilion  we drove for hours and stopped frequently to walk on the sands  all the while chatting about bedouin history and customs and camels     our desert ship     said mosa   we spied plenty of camels and wind sculpted rocks but no other cars or people  finally  we passed two jeeps parked near a large rock  where maybe    tourists were awaiting sunset     we will go elsewhere     musa said     i don   t like a crowd     we found our own rock a half mile farther  then mosa disappeared for a few minutes to find    fuel for tea     he returned with a few roots and twigs  pulled a kettle and a packet of spices from the car  and kindled a fire  as the sun dropped past the horizon  we sipped a brew of sage  cinnamon  camomile and cardamom  and sat in silence  getting there  fly into jordan   s queen alia international airport  and drive about     hours to petra  alternatively  from israel enter jordan through one of two border crossings  at jerusalem or eilat  the latter is arguably easier and faster  it takes roughly     hours from eilat to petra  staying there  the most upscale hotel in the area is the m  venpick  across the street from the entrance to petra  from about      a night  movenpick com petra   more modest but comfortable alternatives are alanbat hotel from about     a night  alanbat com  and the petra moon hotel  from about     a night  petramoonhotel com   in wadi rum  sun city camp is as luxe as you   ll find  from about      a night  suncitycamp com   exploring there  tour operator hosni mayoof organizes customized tours in petra  wadi rum and throughout jordan  welcometojordan info   in wadi rum  guide mosa alrawajfih leads daily desert tours as well as multiday excursions  stargate wadirum gmail com
