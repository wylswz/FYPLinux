 snapchat  whatsapp  google   s new allo  they   ve all got    em  then there are the sticker apps themselves  bitmoji  the snapchat owned app that millions of people  including my friend   s father  use to create personalized cartoons  has been topping the app charts for months  celebrity sticker packs have become the new celebrity perfume   kim kardashian  kimoji   justin bieber  jusmoji   ellen degeneres  emoji exploji    all want to spice up your chats  for a nominal fee  that is  stickers are the latest cash cow for tech companies and app makers  line  the popular japanese messaging app  says it makes     million a month in sticker sales independent artists have swarmed the space  too  even me  well  my puppy   yes  for this article  i created a free set of stickers of my dog  browser  why all the sticker insanity  a sticker is worth a thousand words  of course  with text based communication  we miss facial and visual cues  and you know those tiny emojis that come with your phone  they just don   t cut it  with stickers  you turn your boring message transcript into a fun comic book  i like to think of my bitmoji as a better version of me   flawless skin  perfect hair and a constant stream of fun  emotional and witty responses bitmojis go where simple emojis can   t  try finding an emoji character that conveys    you   ve got this     or    happy anniversary     or even    i   m hungry      let alone     i   m hangry      making your very own bitmoji is simple  even for the uninitiated  download the iphone or android app  sign up with your email or snapchat account and start designing your digital you  you can adjust everything from hair color to face lines  pay close attention to shape of your eyes and nose   you can thank me when your avatar looks more like the real you  once you   re done  cartoon you appears in various scenes  select one and you can send it through a variety of messaging apps  if you turn on the bitmoji keyboard  you can use them inside messaging apps   on an iphone  go to settings   general   keyboards   bitmoji hasn   t yet released an imessage app  which makes it easier to drag stickers into your ios messages app conversations  bitmoji co founder ba blackstock wouldn   t discuss any future plans but tells me the company is looking into it perusing the hundreds of different scenes and comments is half the fun of bitmojiing   yes  it   s already a verb   but as you do it  look closely at the facial expressions  the variation of smiles and frowns is a subtle part of the brilliance    so much information is conveyed in your face and not just your words     says blackstock  with bitmoji     you   re not just seeing text  you   re seeing your friend   it makes your text feel more human     those who fear further decline of verbal communication will balk at this  but it   s a complement to  and not a replacement for  writing  for us highly sarcastic communicators  it   s a godsend  when my sister sent a photo of her weekend getaway in napa valley  the bitmoji with a mona lisa smile holding a    poor you    sign seemed designed for that very moment  for those who can   t find the right expressions with plain old emojis or even bitmoji  there   s an entire world of shareable images to choose from  let   s face it  sometimes  a kim kardashian ugly cry face best sums up your emotional state  it may be  after all  the most popular sticker in the world  don   t laugh  the    kimoji app  available for android and iphones  has been downloaded more than half a million times  according to sensor tower  even though many of the stickers are  as the kids say  nsfw  not suitable for work   the app has made nearly      million in revenue since its december      launch  every few months  kim releases another sticker pack inside the app  there   s back to school  holiday    even a presidential pack  which features a cry face trump and clinton many are hoping to be the next kim of the sticker business  in just a few weeks  kevin hart   s kevmoji has already grossed an estimated    k  according to sensor tower  and look out  backstreet   s back    as a    emoji set  like ringtones and    candy crush    lives before it  the sticker pack is the new digital impulse buy  and the creators and app stores know it  a dollar or two for a sticker pack doesn   t seem that harmful   that is  until you realize you   ve bought    or so packs  i quickly spent more than        testing    stickers this week  there are free stickers  too  but usually they come from companies such as starbucks  dunkin    donuts  burger king who hope you   ll turn your private messages into a billboard for their products  swyft media  a company that creates branded stickers  says that it   s already sent     packs to apple   s brand new imessage app store  it   s all part of what i call the    moji of everything     it   s hard to find an object that hasn   t been emojified  popemoji  it   s there  love cats  good luck picking just one sticker pack  prefer dogs  it   s more a question of which breed you want when i purchased the    corgimoji app from apple   s imessage store  i was happy to know this money  or at least the     apple hands over to the creator  went not to some overpaid celebrity but to    year old connie cheng  who runs a small website and merchandise business for corgi lovers  download joanna stern   s free pupmoji sticker app from apple   s imessage store  she also inspired me to create a free sticker pack of my puppy  browser  after she told me that creating a sticker app for apple   s app store required little to no software coding experience  i rolled up my sleeves  created and then submitted    pupmoji    to apple for approval  the hardest part  finding a talented artist to draw my adorable cavapoo  my colleague nathan olivarez giles proved to be a perfect fit for the  unpaid  job i can now respond to my friend   s dad with a sticker of browser laughing  you can   t beat that with a little old emoji  write to joanna stern at joanna stern wsj com
