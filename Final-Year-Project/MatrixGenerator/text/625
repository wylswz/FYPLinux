   you go to the bullpen and it   s like     y   all going out tonight or something        cubs reliever carl edwards jr  said odd as it may seem  rondon and strop may be onto something  last year   s world series champion  the kansas city royals  featured two players  catcher salvador perez and shortstop alcides escobar  who wore victoria   s secret perfume during games  they believed it helped them play better david ortiz  who just finished his legendary career with the boston red sox  wore cologne during the team   s      title run     it   s the good luck smell     said cubs catcher david ross  who played on the      red sox germain  the canadian perfumer  said sexual paris is not made with athletes in mind  priced at up to     per bottle  its primary purpose is to arouse members of the opposite sex  but germain said such fragrances also instill confidence that can help athletes perform better  particularly with certain scents    mandarin orange  even a basil is incredible     germain said     they   re very invigorating    cubs manager joe maddon is no stranger to the power of smell  in early       while managing the tampa bay rays  maddon had a problem  his team stunk  to help pull the rays out of last place  he brought several bottles of old cologne to the ballpark one day and put them on a table for players to try  the team responded with a much needed victory     aroma still matters     maddon wrote on twitter that night but the scent of the cubs    bullpen is of the pitchers    own making  strop     years old  picked up the habit years ago from a teammate in the minor leagues  an infielder named esteban german    i was always like     you   re going to be sweating right now  why are you using cologne        strop said     he was like     exactly  i don   t want to smell  i want to smell good       rondon      adopted the routine late last year  having spent the better part of three seasons admiring the scent of strop  together  they have been both the nose and the heart of the cubs    bullpen  which was further fortified by the midseason acquisition of closer aroldis chapman  during the nlcs  which begins saturday in chicago  they will serve as a vital bridge between the cubs    starters and chapman it seems fitting that maddon uses them as almost interchangeable pieces  the two of them play catch together before games  their lockers at wrigley field are just a few feet away from each other and they will often critique each other   s performance    they keep an eye on each other like they   re brothers     cubs bullpen coach lester strode said but the most distinctive thing rondon and strop share is a firm belief that a refined smell leads to an elegant performance  strop is already on his second bottle of cologne this season  between home and road games  he emptied a bottle of paco rabanne   million earlier in the year  but his current selection should last him through october if the cubs win the world series  strop said he plans to wear it for the parade  write to brian costa at brian costa wsj com and jared diamond at jared diamond wsj com
