articles drawing a more audacious city           once upon a time  the big apple might have had a very big apple  when ideas were being proposed for a reimagining of times square in the     s  the centerpiece of one submission  from architectural firm venturi  scott brown  was a prominent red apple  hovering tantalizingly in the middle of the action     never built new york     a new book by  sam lubell and  greg goldin  scheduled for release oct     by metropolis books  explores more than     of the city   s most intriguing and unrealized architectural and design projects  including that plonked down fruit  the book documents visions ranging from proposed alternatives to the city   s rigid grid system  laid down in the commissioners    plan of       to  r  buckminster fuller   s      idea for a shatterproof glass dome over manhattan  right up to architect  daniel libeskind   s discarded plans for the world trade center site    i like to joke that we   re experts in failure     said mr  lubell     what doesn   t get built can tell you almost more than what does get built about how a city works     in their research for the book  mr  lubell and mr  goldin scoured archives countrywide  including at columbia university and the library of congress  they reached out to existing firms and sought out former personnel from firms that no longer exist  compared with many of these futuristic and fantastical plans  the built reality of new york  subject to untold regulations and compromises  can often seem uninspired     the reality isn   t as sexy as the pure conception     said mr  lubell  beach pneumatic railway       in       a preliminary version of a new mass transit system  conceived by inventor and magazine editor  alfred ely beach  was unveiled in lower manhattan  an underground railway in which cylindrical railcars were pushed along by atmospheric pressure  the full  completed system  beach promised  would convey passengers from city hall to central park in eight minutes     it   s difficult to imagine that this is something that could have worked  but it   s something that london  for example  had up and running     said mr  lubell  national american indian memorial       visitors arriving in new york harbor by ship might have been welcomed not only by lady liberty  but a towering indian chief  hand raised in a sign of peace  atop a seven story pedestal  the proposed national american indian memorial on staten island was designed by  thomas hastings  perhaps best known for his beaux arts design for the main new york public library building in       president william howard taft declared that no monument would have    a more conspicuous place in the world        it would have been a whole new symbol for the city     said mr  lubell     but people weren   t ready to have a plan like this for native americans at this point in history  sadly     city of new manhattan        one of the more seemingly unrealistic schemes in new york   s never built history was architect t  kennard thomson   s plan to extend manhattan southward via landfill  stretching it from the battery almost to staten island  with some drawings resembling something straight out of  jules verne  said mr  lubell  the scheme was covered on the front pages of new york newspapers for more than    years     it is in one sense science fiction because it seems so utterly unattainable     said mr  goldin     where would the money and political clout come from  but in another sense  from a purely engineering point of view  what he proposed is not all that crazy undoable    thomson   s wasn   t the only scheme to grow the city  in      a plan to drain the east river envisioned using the new land for highways and parking spaces   and in       a proposal emerged to connect manhattan with new jersey by filling in the hudson    there was this idea in the air that engineers  and mankind  could do no wrong     said mr  lubell  the hyperboloid       in the     s there were serious plans to tear down grand central terminal and replace it with a slender hourglass shaped office tower and transit hub designed by  i m  pei  at     stories  it would have been the tallest structure in the city its shape presaged skyscraper designs built in recent years in the middle east  said mr  lubell     as much as i would have hated grand central to be destroyed engineering wise  design wise this was ahead of its time      bridge of houses       in the early      s  architect steven holl had the idea that the city   s disused elevated rail could be turned into a linear bridge top city  allocating space for both luxury apartments and temporary housing for the homeless  they would be built in a hopscotch pattern and share communal courtyards     one can see a very different notion of the city at work in that proposal     said mr  goldin     one far more equitable  more democratic  more attuned to the margins and the underside    though mr  holl   s conception went unrealized  some believe it planted the seed for what would ultimately become the high line     for any architect that makes visionary proposals  most of the work is unbuilt     said mr  holl     but those ideas can still have an impact  they encourage people to reflect on dreams
