articles get your children good and dirty           our friend julia moved to a small free range pig and poultry farm when her first child  jedd  was a preschooler  when her second baby was born  she would strap him on her back every morning so that she could go to the chicken coop to pick up eggs  jedd would chase and ride the chickens   and sometimes taste their feed and touch the fresh eggs  a couple of times  she even caught him chewing on something he had picked up from the ground at first  all of this caused julia to freak out  but once she realized that jedd wasn   t getting sick from these encounters with the chickens  she relaxed a bit  her second child  jacob  soon followed suit and never hesitated to get dirty on the farm  she once found him knee deep in a cesspool of pig waste  her early worries that her children were going to contract diseases from all this messiness dissipated  and she was pleased to see that they remained healthy was julia being an irresponsible parent   or might we all have something to learn from her example for most of the past century  we have considered microbes bad news  and for good reason  they cause disease  pandemics and death  most human communities have experienced the benefits of medical advances like antibiotics  vaccines and sterilization  which have radically reduced the number and severity of infections that we suffer throughout life  dying from a microbial infection is now a very rare event in the western world  and  in the u s   lifespans have increased by some    years since        in large part because of success against infectious diseases unfortunately  this progress has come with a price  as news reports have been telling us for some years now  our anti microbe mission has been accompanied  in industrialized countries  by an explosion in the prevalence of chronic noninfectious diseases and disorders  diabetes  allergies  asthma  inflammatory bowel diseases  autoimmune diseases  autism  obesity and certain types of cancer are at an all time high  the incidence of some of these disorders is doubling every    years  and they are starting to appear sooner in life  often in childhood all of these diseases have a genetic component  but their alarming growth cannot be explained by genetics alone  recent studies find a direct link between the presence and absence of certain bacteria and all of the chronic diseases mentioned above  it turns out that the microbes within us are much more than quiet residents  they are an inherent part of our physiology  and altering them leads to disease our own      study  published in the journal science translational medicine  found  for example  that   month olds who had four particular microbes in their feces were much less likely to get asthma later in life  when those four microbes were introduced into mice  they protected against experimentally induced asthma  showing for the first time that alterations in gut microbes can drive the development of the disease  lab experiments also have found that obese mice lose weight when they get a transfer of gut microbes from lean mice  and the reverse holds true as well  with lean mice growing fat after a transfer from obese mice  the practical upshot of all this research is clear  our health depends to a large degree on maintaining a robust and diverse community of microorganisms in our bodies   and establishing good gut health as children is especially important during the first few months of life  the microbe community in our bodies is considerably less established and stable than later in life  any drastic changes to it have a much higher chance of permanently altering our microbiota  as specialists call this world of tiny organisms within us  and our long term health from the moment we are born  we begin getting colonized by bacteria  which kick start a series of fundamental biological processes  including the development of our immune system  before birth  the lining of our gut is full of immature immune cells  when bacteria move in  the immune cells react to them  changing and multiplying  they even move to other parts of the body to train other cells with the information they have acquired from these intruders  if deprived of this interaction  the immune system remains sloppy and immature  unable to fight off diseases properly scientists haven   t figured out exactly how microbes do this at the molecular level  but we do know that most bacteria will teach these immune cells to tolerate them  whereas some bacteria   the pathogens that cause diseases   prompt strong resistance  the result is to make the intestine a relatively controlled and harmonious place another fundamental function of microbes is to aid in the regulation of our metabolism  like other animals  humans obtain energy from food that is digested and absorbed in the intestines  besides helping us digest certain foods that the intestines can   t handle on their own  bacteria produce compounds that help to define how we use or store energy in our bodies  new research also shows that our microbiota plays an important role in neurological development and even in the health of our blood vessels  such discoveries have led scientists to call our microbiota a    new organ     perhaps the last human organ to be discovered by modern medicine  most of this knowledge is still relatively new and many pieces of the puzzle remain unsolved  but protecting the initial developmental stages of our microbiota clearly has a significant impact on our health inflammatory diseases  such as asthma  allergies and inflammatory bowel disease  and metabolic diseases  such as obesity and diabetes  are characterized by alterations in our immune system and our metabolic regulation  knowing what we do now about the role of the microbiota  it is not surprising that these diseases are being diagnosed in more children  they are  to a great extent  a consequence of relatively recent changes in our lifestyle   modern diet  oversanitization  excessive use of antibiotics   that have altered the specific microbes that affect our metabolism early on  we urgently need to find ways to modify our behavior so that our microbes can function properly never before in human history have babies and children grown up so cleanly  and our diets have lost many of the elements most crucial to the health of our guts  we have become very bad hosts to our microbes what to do about it  the u s  food and drug administration took one helpful step earlier this month when it banned some chemicals used in antibacterial soap  but the most important changes need to take place in our everyday routines parents can expose their children to an array of microbes by encouraging them to spend time outside  like our friend julia on her farm  but not necessarily with chicken and pig waste   today children spend much less time outside than they did only    years ago babies and toddlers often aren   t allowed to play in the dirt or sand  and when they are  they are wiped clean immediately  phrases like     yuck  don   t play in the mud     or    don   t touch that bug  it   s dirty     have become second nature we need to unlearn these habits  by preventing babies and children from following their innate impulse to get dirty  we shield them from the microbial exposure that is essential for the development of a healthy immune system parents can also promote good gut health in their kids through diet  it is well established that the western diet   high in fats  sugars and highly refined grains   is very strongly associated with a number of diseases  especially obesity and the closely linked disease of type   diabetes  our ancestors grazed on a variety of foods  which ensured a variety of microbes in their intestines  eating a range of different foods provides a hospitable environment for a range of different microbes  today      of the world   s food comes from just    plant species and five animal species  amazingly  just three species   rice  corn and wheat   account for     of the calories that humans obtain from plants  except for regions where a lack of economic development has preserved older farming and dietary practices  more people are eating refined white sugar  white flour and processed fats  instead of our ancestral diet of vegetables  fiber  fruit and nuts  a      study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences compared the microbiota of children living in rural burkina faso in west africa to the microbiota of urban  city dwelling children in italy  the african children ate a high fiber diet of vegetables  grains and legumes  with no processed foods  whereas the diet of the european children was full of sugars  animal fats and refined grains  the gut microbes of the children from burkina faso were very different from   and much more diverse than   those of the italian kids we wouldn   t want to say that children in burkina faso have a healthier lifestyle than italian children  they are more likely to suffer severe infections and malnutrition  and they have a lower life expectancy than children born in western europe  but they also have a decreased risk of suffering from the immune diseases that are epidemic in the western world in an ideal world  children would harbor a rich and diverse community of microbes without the threat of severe infectious diseases  but our current practices only address half of this equation  given how well bacteria respond to diet  eating a variety of foods is perhaps the best way to increase microbial diversity  and there   s no better time to do this than during the first few years of life as a practical matter  this means that we shouldn   t feed a baby only rice cereal for weeks until the package is finished  we should offer a variety of grains  including oats  rice  barley and quinoa  it   s also important to offer whole grains instead of refined ones  the western diet is extremely low in fiber  and refined grains contain very little of it protein rich legumes  such as lentils  beans and peas  have an abundance of fiber and can be easily mashed for babies  also try nontraditional starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes  parsnips or cassava  tapioca  rather than just sticking to low fiber veggies such as potatoes  for older children  add fermented foods  such as yogurt  kefir  sauerkraut and other pickled vegetables most people in developed societies won   t crave these foods the same way that they crave the texture of macaroni and cheese or the like  but infancy is the best time to introduce good dietary practices  for children  eating healthy foods becomes a habit in the same way as cleaning their room does  by doing it frequently food isn   t the only way that we have altered our microbiota  however  our microbes have perhaps taken the biggest hit from one of the best things humanity has ever invented  antibiotics  these wonder drugs have saved millions of lives and will save millions more in the future but antibiotics aren   t targeted missiles that kill only the bad bacteria causing infections  they are carpet bombs that kill good and bad bacteria indiscriminately  research now suggests a link between the use of antibiotics in early childhood and problems such as obesity  diabetes  asthma  allergies  autism and inflammatory bowel disease we ought to become more restrictive with the use of antibiotics in children  parents shouldn   t assume that all infections have to be treated with these drugs  upper respiratory tract infections and colds are often caused by viruses  so antibacterials won   t cure them  most sore throats  especially if the child also has a runny nose and cough  are caused by viruses and don   t need antibiotic therapy  if a child has a mild ear infection  it   s reasonable to watch and wait for a few days to see if it gets better on its own before starting antibiotic therapy  also  parents should consider giving probiotic supplements  with live bacteria and yeasts  to a child if he or she is being given antibiotics  with the scientific information now available  parents can make informed choices about helping their children to develop a thriving microbiota  we are still years away from learning the whole story of how microbes contribute to our physical well being  but what we know today is pretty convincing evidence that they are crucial  especially early in life for much of the past century  we have ignored  and often destroyed  the microbes that keep us healthy  it   s time now to correct the balance   dr  finlay is a microbiologist specializing in bacterial infections and the peter wall distinguished professor at the university of british columbia  dr  arrieta is an assistant professor in the department of physiology and pharmacology at the university of calgary  this essay is adapted from their new book     let them eat dirt  saving your child from an oversanitized world     published by algonquin books of chapel hill
