while ridership has ebbed and flowed for decades with the ups and downs of the economy  the  horse  business is trotting ahead  driven largely by gen x and gen y women who are also happily indoctrinating their daughters  ms  connell said the number of    well cared for horses    in the u s  totals about two million and is climbing horse culture is adapting to the new demographic  with clubs promoting lower intensity  and less dangerous  competitive events like hunter pace and trail riding  technology  from gps navigation to fitbit style performance trackers  see sidebar   is taking hold  making riding more inviting and arguably a bit safer more than     of horse owners are women  according to the united states equestrian federation  and many of them acknowledge that horses are a midlife crisis purchase   the equivalent of a corvette for men  though arguably less pathetic   like many stealthily expensive pastimes  horse ownership often seems benign at first  a trained horse typically starts at between        and         with more exotic breeds commanding six digit prices  but the cost of care can quickly escalate  hitting         to         a year  basic veterinary fees for immunizations  checkups and routine deworming treatments can drain you of      annually  set aside a few thousand dollars to cover injuries and sickness  and don   t forget      or more for the farrier  who trims hooves and handles the horse   s shoes  boarding adds another      to        a month  or more  depending on how much time you want to give misty in the pasture  generally  a horse costs as much to maintain as a small airplane  though the latter admittedly lacks long lashes     i have to say owning a horse has cost much more than i initially expected     said ms  o   brien  but building a close relationship with her dutch warmblood  named jazz  have been worth the sacrifices     i wouldn   t hesitate to do it again     galloping gadgets    a hippophile   s guide to teach    seaver girth the gadgets that have long helped human athletes monitor their workouts are slowly trickling down to the steed  the seaver girth is similar to a chest worn heart rate monitor in that it straps around a horse   s midsection  but the device reports on more than animal   s heartbeat to its companion android or ios app  it also measures speed  calories burned  recovery time between exercise sessions and jump height  riders can use the system to tailor practice rides to specific goals  like improving the animal   s endurance  timing or agility  the seaver recently completed a successful crowdfunding campaign and is estimated to be available to purchase early next year   seaverhorse com      viewranger many riders were early adopters of hand held gps technology  but those gadgets are old news now  the advanced viewranger navigation app for apple watch  as well as android and ios  is popular among horse riders  who use it to download maps of their planned routes  pinpoint their current location  measure average speed and track how far they have traveled  the app uses gps to guide riders to a series of waypoints and sounds an alarm if they stray too far from the path  the viewranger also tracks the locations of other riders in your group through a system called buddybeacon  the downside here is that  unlike downloaded maps  the buddybeacon requires cell coverage  which often is not available on isolated trails  free to download  viewranger com      nightwatch halter similar to those connected baby monitors that ease parents    anxiety about being away from their infant children  the nightwatch halter allows concerned owners to keep tabs on how their animals are doing in the barn  this electronic halter  also available as a collar  tracks the animal   s heart and breathing rates  movements and posture  this may sound like more information than even the most devoted horse lover could possibly need  but it isn   t as outlandish as it sounds  one surprising danger horses face is becoming stuck or    cast    in a stall  this happens when a horse lies down or rolls into a position with its legs too close to a wall and has difficulty standing up  possibly leading to panic and injury  the nightwatch app is available for android and ios  and its data can also be viewed from any web browser  available for preorder        nightwatch   com
