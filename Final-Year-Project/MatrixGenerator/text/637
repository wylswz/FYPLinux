 has been on a roll  the success of its many models of smartphones  aided by massive marketing campaigns  has made it by far the leading maker of devices running on  google s android operating system and the chief rival to  apple

 in smartphones  in fact  samsung is almost as synonymous with android as google  now  the korean electronics giant is about to launch its latest flagship phone in the u s   a market where it hasn t been able to dislodge apple s iphone as the leader  the new model  called the galaxy s    will roll out over the next week at  at t

 t mobile and sprint  and likely sometime in may at verizon wireless i ve been testing the galaxy s   intensively for four days and while i admire some of its features  overall  it isn t a game changer  it s an evolution of the prior model and despite some improvements  it still is especially weak in the software samsung adds to basic android  i found samsung s software often gimmicky  duplicative of standard android apps  or  in some cases  only intermittently functional i urge readers looking for a new android smartphone to carefully consider the more polished looking  and quite capable  htc one  rather than defaulting to the latest samsung the new galaxy boasts a giant   inch screen  a bit bigger than the     inch display on its predecessor  but its mostly plastic body is thinner and lighter  it may stretch some small pockets and purses  and look funny when held to your ear  but it doesn t feel like a brick  still  compared with the iphone    with its   inch screen  the s   is     larger and     heavier  the new galaxy has a    megapixel camera  compared with   megapixels for the iphone   nearly all android phones already come with two email apps   one reserved for google s gmail  but on the galaxy s    there are also two online video and music stores  two music and video players  two calendars and two browsers  yet out of the box  there s no camera icon on the lock screen so you can immediately take a picture   you can add this feature  via the settings menu  in   you guessed it   two different ways  some of samsung s new software features worked well  a feature called air view lets you see expanded information about things like email previews and calendar items by hovering over them with your finger  a multi window feature splits the screen so you can view two apps at once  but both features only work with certain apps  i also liked an improved version of easy mode  which substitutes the sometimes confusing normal screens and settings panels for simpler ones with larger  cleaner icons and simplified settings another good move  samsung rewrote the standard android email app so it s better  with a unified inbox and other nice improvements speaking of settings  samsung is proud of an expanded panel of one touch settings icons you can get to by pulling down the android notification window from the top edge of the screen  i liked the idea  but this panel is likely to confuse users with items labeled  air gesture    smart stay  and  s beam   and other special samsung features there s an array of new camera effects  such as one where you can superimpose for fun a small square image of your own face onto a picture you re taking  and another where you can create a  drama  shot in which a single moving person appears multiple times in sequence  these are easy to select  but i doubt they ll be used frequently i had almost zero success with a suite of features that claim to take certain actions by detecting whether you re watching the screen  for instance  smart scroll will scroll the screen based on the angle of your head and smart pause will stop playing a video when you look away  i only got these to work about     of the time  samsung blamed lighting conditions  even though i used it in many settings  on many key hardware specs  the galaxy s   shines  its screen and camera resolution beat the iphone   s and i found its pictures to be slightly better than those from the apple phone  which is nearly a year old  its removable battery gave me a full day of use  but the plastic body felt a bit insubstantial to me and the mono speaker on the rear was only fair  oddly  i found the sound via headphones to be too soft in some cases  though voice calls were clear prices will vary because t mobile has stopped subsidizing smartphones and sprint has a temporary new customer discount  but at t will sell the base    gigabyte model for      with a two year contract  t mobile s price  paid over two years  will be           more than the iphone    verizon hasn t provided details  according to samsung my test model was running on the t mobile network and even indicated that it was using super fast lte  which t mobile is still building out  in some areas  but data download speeds in the d c  suburbs averaged just      megabits per second  versus       mbps for an iphone   running verizon lte  the galaxy s   would likely be faster on verizon in the same location while many will compare the galaxy s   with the iphone    i also compared it with the      htc one  which came out april     the htc has a handsome  sturdier  aluminum body  dual stereo speakers  an excellent camera  better screen resolution than the new samsung and twice the base memory for the same price if you re a nut for lists of new features  love samsung or crave an even bigger display  the galaxy s   may be for you  it s a good phone  just not a great one    find all of walt mossberg s columns and videos at the all things
