articles imogen cunningham in focus review her life of blooming creativity            boston it is not a coincidence that  karen haas  the curator of     imogen cunningham  in focus     is the lane curator of photographs at the museum of fine arts  boston   william lane  a new england industrialist  and his wife  saundra  assembled one of the great collections of   th century american modernist art  one that included about     prints of cunningham   s  cunningham             was recognized early on as an important photographer but  in spite of a career that lasted for seven decades  she was not a prolific printer  so large collections of her works are rare  but ansel and  virginia adams had introduced cunningham to the lanes  who befriended her and bought her works  when william lane died in       ms  haas was hired to organize the photographs in his estate  and her connection with them continued after they were donated to the mfa    in focus    is something of a pun  referring not only to the attention the show pays to cunningham   s career but to the sharply focused style of    straight photography    developed by  edward weston  adams  cunningham and the other members of the san francisco bay area   s group f    at a time when the pictorialist style   soft focus in imitation of painting and often sentimental   reigned   imogen cunningham  in focus    museum of fine arts  boston   through june     the lane collection includes many of cunningham   s images of flowers  and seven of these are among the    prints in the show  when she went to the university of washington there were no courses in photography  so she studied botany and chemistry  in the early     s  when she was raising three young children and unable to pursue her career as a portrait photographer  she began shooting the flora in her garden  these are masterpieces of modernist art     magnolia blossom  tower of jewels            is an extreme close up of the flower   s stamen  it is seen on a slight tilt  the clear details of its parts and the careful lighting giving it the stature of sculpture or architecture  the image is lovely  and the attention to detail hints at both cunningham   s knowledge of and affection for her subject  the spiky    aloe            the enfolded    exploding bud  billbergia             and the erect    aloe bud     before       illustrate cunningham   s sophisticated use of shadows as elements of her compositions  and the last two her sly sexual innuendo  for most of her career cunningham made her living as a portrait photographer  she said she preferred shooting ugly men because they were the least likely to complain about the results  but she had a passion for photographing artists of all sorts     welland lathrop  dancer           and     martha graham           are two choice examples and show the attention she paid to artists    hands  the moody graham portrait  with her face in shadow  landed cunningham a stint shooting hollywood personalities for vanity fair  her picture of an introspective    morris graves           has the mystical painter set against a rock  almost blending into it  in     ansel adams  yosemite            she photographed her friend as he was setting up his view camera amid the mountains he loved  and    edward weston at point lobos           shows the dramatic stretch of the california coast where weston took many of his best known seascapes  the exhibition includes    charis and imogen            a picture taken by weston the same day  cunningham is fussing with her camera as she prepares to shoot weston   s model and sometimes wife cunningham   s extensive nude photography is represented by    sunbath  alta on the beach                a tightly cropped portrait with the recumbent alta shot from the top down so her head is at the bottom of the frame  and the famous    triangles            the latter is an example of high modernism in which the female body is represented as a combination of geometric forms but never loses its identity     in focus    also shows less familiar aspects of cunningham   s work  there are  for example  two industrial photographs  the oil rigs of    signal hill            and the distinctive shiny steel    fageol ventilators           atop the motor company   s factory in oakland  her puckish sense of humor is present in three self portraits     imogen cunningham and  lisette model on mccallister street     about        shot in the crowded interior of an antique store     self portrait  demark            where she is seen dimly reflected in the window of a store selling girdles  and    self portrait on geary street            in which she sees herself in a mirrored column of a storefront window cluttered with litter  the surreal    stairs and stairs at merry   s           was created by printing the same exterior staircase twice in one composition  in    the poet and his alter ego            two portraits of the same man are printed side by side  in one his eyes look to the right and in the other to the left so that he seems to be observing himself it wouldn   t have been fair of ms  haas to deny exhibition visitors the treat of seeing  judy dater   s    imogen and twinka            a print also in the lane collection  the image of the    year old photographer in her long coat  with her black cap on her white hair  stalking the naked model in the forest with her rolleiflex gives the show its perfect ending   mr  meyers writes on photography for the journal  an exhibition of photographs from his civics project opens at the  nailya alexander gallery on oct
