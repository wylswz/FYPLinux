 have already expressed doubt about an adaptation     here we go again     wrote  daniel collier in a huffington post article titled    why we really don   t need an american version of    peep show            it does sometimes feel that the usa is where great british tv comedy goes to die     carmi zlotnik  managing director for original programming at starz  says the network is feeling a    bit of pressure        let   s get this right and not screw it up  because the fans will let you know if you do     he says  while british talent shows from    strictly come dancing    to    the x factor    have found mainstream success in u s  adaptations  comedy remains a tougher nut to crack  remakes of classic british sitcoms  including the     s show    fawlty towers    and the     s hit    men behaving badly     have bombed stateside  more recently  networks have tried and failed with    absolutely fabulous    and    the it crowd       maybe british humor is a little drier than american audiences are used to     says  saul austerlitz  author of    sitcom  a history in    episodes from i love lucy to community        it   s seen in the u s  as an acquired taste    mr  jorne first spoke with starz about adapting    peep show    about a year ago  the los angeles based writer   s work on fx   s    wilfred     another adaptation with an unusual conceit  and the starz series    blunt talk    had caught their attention     he has that kind of ocd thing where he wants to magnify and scrutinize small details     says mr  zlotnik  a previous attempt by fox to bring    peep show    stateside in      resulted in a pilot starring    the big bang theory   s     johnny galecki  but stalled after that  another attempt  from spike in       also failed  part of the difficulty lies in the show   s unusual devices  it uses point of view  pov  camera angles  so that the viewer sees from the perspective of a particular character  and vocalizes mark and jez   s  frequently depraved  inner monologues  beyond that  it embodies a dark strain of british humor  cynical  hyper self aware and filled with references to the class system    they   ve got some traits that are traditionally considered very british     says dick fiddy  who runs the tv archive at the british film institute     you want to spend time with them  you might even want to go for a drink with them  but you wouldn   t want to be friends with them     an adaptation would need to find corresponding traits     the demons that wander around america   s inner monologue     these are demons mr  jorne is courting  using the original show   s template of    micro observational comedy        it   s the stuff no one talks about  but when it   s dramatized in the show you can   t help but recognize it in yourself     mr  jorne     years old  often looks to nbc   s    the office    as a model adaptation of a british show  the friendlier u s  version    didn   t stray too far from the  bbc  original at the beginning     but eventually grew into its own show  for    peep show     he   s following suit  keeping pov shots and inner monologue voice overs  but americanizing other elements  mark   s equivalent character will no longer be obsessed with world war ii  for instance  which mr  jorne found too british   he wouldn   t disclose which chapter of u s  history would take its place  but he isn   t interested in trying to brighten the show up  and says he hopes a premium channel like starz will help it reach a dedicated audience  one of the things that makes it successful is    the kind of twistedness  the darkness  the sadness     he says     if you take that out of the equation  i don   t know that you could say you   re really doing    peep show         messrs  bain and armstrong understand the challenges well  one of their first collaborations was a british adaptation of the fox sitcom    that      s show     it ran on  itv
