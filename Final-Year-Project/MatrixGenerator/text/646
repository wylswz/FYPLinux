this is the one i mean that it s from the wall street journal     welcome to your money matters i and charlie turner in new york     holiday spending is forecast to reach its highest point since the great recession     rising ten percent this year compared with the two thousand fifteen holiday season     that is according to pw sees two thousand sixteen holiday outlook     however it s not all good news for bricks and mortars retailers     let s get the survey details from steve barr pw sees u s consumer and retail leader     steve first off a ten percent increase in spending how much will each consumers spend on average this year     yet a share     photo     reuters     one thousand one hundred and twenty one dollars which overall     it     can increase from two thousand and fifteen     and furthermore you say consumers making less than fifty thousand dollars the year will likely boost their percentage spending levels more than consumers overall     yet we we don t really interact in turn are fewer     households earning less than thirty thousand dollars     will it ever really ready to spend and we actually expect to spend up to twenty percent more     all i can     travel and entertainment related to the overall holiday spending     that s not a great piece of news for retailers is that because the gifts will likely be more experience oriented should we say in awe that s not all retailers ally     piano right so     the good news is     consumers     the challenge for retailers is     going to share that     and     i m not only when those folks are focused on travel and entertainment or overall experience     but the other challenge especially for store based retailer when     we saw a term that are we expect a dramatic increase in     overall e commerce and     we expect the e commerce sales     to be up twenty five percent this year     and was going on especially in iraq and about     did you find this year is     twenty four percent we expect a twenty four percent increase in     the completion of transactions on mobile devices to acquire holiday     the mobile     mobile device was really high school to gather information on     the     fund store location     to return     the weather     friend and social networks were recommending     were really get that out to check out to the mall by     completing     the actual purchase transaction     to the store base retailers have a real positive and consumers are ready to spend     but there sure     how to     stay competitive and stay relevant to people to travel and     experience overall and with the online     and     overall mobile     transactions and i guess that and the store base resellers are ramping up their online platforms they are in fact     we expect that     the online     forms of many of the leading retailers     and so will will do exceptionally well this year     and less of me     sure you have to look at those um at maryland leverage three hours     what i keep saying the vote it     may have a strategic out of the primary only holding the camera did not happen     so they re able to leverage     strategically the holiday     they too     can have     a great holiday but i have to execute very well shoppers for what     they wanted the games more knowledgeable storage with     speedy check out well and     that sort of     great price     so     there s a chance for the struggling retailer to do well     and we expect many of them are going to be very well prepared and execute well that all     let s talk about steve who is buying first of all you mention jan s see you call them the demographic zero to twenty years old but you really zeroed in     on the jan s the demographic members who were between seventeen and twenty there i guess the biggest demographic right now on the country and they will likely be spending in strong numbers for the holiday season catey are now are     beginning to emerge and two     shopping years especially     in the order of age that demographic of what they call the interesting thing     they like shopping in stores in the shopping for things like personal electronics     no surprise many of them     can have up to buy and own the active device to any one time but you re also going to include shoes and clothing     what especially interesting     about the gym here too     they re influenced by     social media and and others     much into     any of the other demographic     those include are you really need to be on the day that the judge the earth toward the top off into the

don t provide both free shipping and free returns     this holiday season and that s that s almost mandatory for them     free shipping and free return is it     i only     need to pay with their     narrowing online only or the omnichannel retailers     in the new standard and we re going to see     the requirements for minimum orders     or to pay to return to go away just to stay competitive     and also steve     twc survey found that consumers     will likely start their shopping pretty soon notches when we think they re gonna start around black friday     what we do have a feeling that the holidays     are starting earlier and earlier     some of that would allow them to the tv on     the retailer is turning wiener economic here were     were staying     in extremely competitive     but with no     permanently conditions consumer     to really start the holiday shopping     the lights go out on the front porch for halloween     certainly from topshop earlier when there are a great deal     but the majority of folks who were screener     start earlier     but not in that the black friday we call     them and     can you also mention the importance of france in the survey brands matter to most of the respondents in the school absolutely brand continued to matter     and     in fact we     have an overwhelming response that     where do matter and in our patron that we
