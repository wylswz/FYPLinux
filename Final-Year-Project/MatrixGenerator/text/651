articles more european than wild western            on wednesdayseptember     the new york philharmonic orchestra opens its    th anniversary season  and among its celebratory activities is the new world initiative  a season long  citywide project revolving around anton  n  dvor  k   s ninth symphony in e minor     from the new world     through performances  the first on sept          education and outreach  it endeavors to make this most beloved of dvor  k   s works a cultural touchstone for its audience and the wider public  it will focus on the second movement largo melody   which many know as the song    goin    home      and its connection to the theme of    home     certainly the concept of home was profoundly important to dvor  k              when  in       the american music patron  jeannette thurber invited him to become director of the national conservatory she had established in new york in       he declined  preferring to remain with his large family in prague  and when his friend  johannes brahms later offered to place his personal fortune at dvor  k   s disposal if he would move to vienna and teach at the vienna conservatory  dvor  k turned down that offer  too nevertheless dvor  k ultimately did accept mrs  thurber   s invitation and arrived in new york in september       a european celebrity  he  in turn  liked new york  its people  its democratic ways   he was especially sympathetic to the conservatory   s then radical policy of opening its doors to gifted african  and native american students between his conservatory duties  conducting engagements and forays from his east   th street apartment to grand central terminal or farther uptown to pursue his hobby of train spotting  dvor  k sketched ideas for new works in his notebooks  among them most of the themes for the e minor symphony  on his arrival  dvor  k had been hailed as the man who would lead american music to a glorious future  his own more practical idea was to impart a sense of musical nationalism to his national conservatory students  and thereby sow the seeds of an american school of composition rooted in its own soil  he examined indigenous american music  finding himself most drawn to the spirituals and plantation songs of the south  some of these were sung to him by a gifted african american student whom he invited to his class   harry t  burleigh  later an important composer  performer and arranger of spirituals years earlier dvor  k had been enthralled by a czech translation of  henry wadsworth longfellow   s    song of hiawatha     and mrs  thurber hoped that he would write an american opera on the subject  the first entry in dvor  k   s american sketchbooks  dated       december         and headed    legend     is the largo theme  he completed the score on may           before traveling to spillville  iowa  in june  hence the score was written before dvor  k actually set foot on the prairies  it received its official premiere  to tremendous acclaim  on dec            when performed at carnegie hall by the new york philharmonic under its highly regarded conductor   anton seidl many call it    the new world symphony     which can imply that the music specifically describes america as seen through dvor  k   s eyes  but the symphony   s real name     from the new world      which dvor  k appended to his manuscript score just before delivering it to seidl  has a somewhat different implication   music composed by a european visitor who embraced the spirit and certain inflections of american folk music  but who essentially expressed  as dvor  k himself put it     impressions and greetings from the new world    in his accustomed musical language  he later asserted that what he wrote here was    genuine bohemian music    while listening to this majestic work  one wonders how much our ears have been conditioned to envision buckskins and broncos because of its mood of expansiveness that is one of the salient features of the scores in hollywood westerns  certainly the vigorous horn theme of the first movement is like a gust of the outdoors  but in e minor it is less evocative of the great plains than  say  the great hungarian plain  similarly the brazen e minor march theme of the fourth movement is more eastern european than wild western  scholars point to an approximation of    swing low  sweet chariot    in the first movement flute theme  and in this context the syncopated  dance like rhythms   which also characterize other dvor  k scores   evoke imagery of  george caleb bingham   s paintings of mississippi flatboat men the two inner movements appear to have been inspired initially by    hiawatha     dvor  k himself noted that the scherzo  with its opening echo of the scherzo of beethoven   s ninth symphony  was intended to convey the dance at hiawatha   s wedding feast  the largo is one of the most elegiac of all symphonic slow movements  it begins with a mysterious chromatic passage of seven chords for low woodwinds and brass similar to the kyrie opening in dvor  k   s requiem         the plaintive english horn melody possesses the emotional dignity of a spiritual  since       when  william arms fisher  a former dvor  k student at the national conservatory  persuasively fitted dialect words to the music     goin    home    has been erroneously taken for a genuine one in short  if dvor  k did not don chaps or six shooters to write    from the new world     its enduring appeal resides in its schubert like flow of endearing melody  and this melodic flow is enhanced by vigorous rhythm  wonderfully vivid harmony and richly colored orchestration    mr  scherer writes about music and the fine arts for the journal and is the author of    a history of american classical music     naxos sourcebooks   correction  an earlier version of this article misidentified the train station dvor  k would visit while in new york
