articles how to make your iphone camera good enough for a pro           for as long as there have been cameras  photographers have faced a goldilocks conundrum  the best quality cameras are too heavy  the portable ones sacrifice too much performance finally  there   s a camera that   s just right the ambitious new dxo one takes stunning      megapixel pictures from a device that   s half the size of a deck of cards  the secret  it   s a pro level image sensor and bright lens that plugs onto the base of an iphone  which serves as the viewfinder and central command despite a few compromises  most notably in battery life  the dxo one satisfies mobile photographers    dreams of a pocket size connected camera that can match many of the pro capabilities of a digital slr camera  it picks up where the iphone   s shrunken down   megapixel camera stops  allowing you to take portraits with depth  capture luminous night scenes   and have enough detail to make jumbo sized prints so let   s talk about the price        that isn   t unusual for a camera with these specs  but ranks it among the most expensive non couture iphone accessories  not that sticker shock will abate the lust of avid photographers for this thing  the dxo one is the ultimate big vacation  retirement wanderlust  new baby  like my instagrams dammit camera  santa  i   ve been a very good boy this year there   s some serious imaging tech inside the dxo one  none of which you have to understand to take beautiful shots  it has a   inch image sensor that   s six and    times larger than the one built into the iphone    and about the same as in sony   s      compact rx    iii  its fixed    mm equivalent lens has an aperture that opens to f     which adds depth to photos and finds light in dark scenes  it also records audio and full hd video who is dxo  and how   d they manage to squeeze all this into     ounces  the french company isn   t a household name  but is no stranger to high end photography  it creates image processing software and an industry measurement for sensor quality  an infusion from unnamed investors gave the company a shot to make a camera that leverages all that expertise  the dxo one is a first time product but doesn   t feel like one  aside from an occasional tendency for the beta app i tested to freeze  the company tested it in the field with photographers before starting shipping this week  and it shows the dxo one was made for occasions like saturday night   s supermoon  which i wanted to experience from an out of the way spot that looks over the golden gate bridge onto san francisco  getting to this outlook  called slacker hill  requires a vertical hike that isn   t conducive to lugging along a heavy dslr night landscapes are a difficult assignment for any camera  up there  my iphone   took only a ho hum shot  showing lots of low light noise  but with the dxo one and my phone  i was able to capture the rich color of the sky  and the swirl of the fog across the bay in the interest of science  i also lugged a canon t i dslr up there  my dxo one shots didn   t quite pick up the canon   s range of color  but there was far less distracting noise so i actually prefer the dxo shots  more on that amazing capability in a moment  a number of engineering feats make the dxo one possible  starting with the idea that our increasingly powerful smartphones can fill in for the processors and preview screens that make up a lot of the bulk on other cameras  the      sony qx     and      olympus air try this too  but they suffer from sluggish wireless performance  dxo solved this by making its camera plug physically into the lightning port on the bottom of the iphone  so there   s no lag a connector plug springs out when you pull the dxo one   s lens cap all the way down  hooked into your iphone  or ipad  charging port via this little nub  the camera looks like it might be a little flimsy  but its aluminum and plastic body is light enough to hang on except when directly jostled  the camera can also angle up and down about    degrees  or flip around entirely to point at you  because what the world needs now is higher quality selfies when you plug it in  dxo   s app pops up with a live preview from the camera  tap on the phone screen where you want to focus in fully automatic mode  or use the app to adjust most of the manual controls available on an slr camera  including aperture  shutter speed  iso and focus  the dxo one saves your pictures on its own micro sd card in jpeg and raw for later precision editing  and can simultaneously save a jpeg to your iphone for immediate instagramming because it   s so light  subtle shaking in your hand could introduce blur  i noticed a soft focus in some of my shots  a problem i learned to avoid by setting the shutter on a   second delay  i also used a tiny iphone tripod in the golden gate experiment  i hit the field with the dxo one over the past week and experimented with it as if on a dslr  here are examples of shots my iphone alone just couldn   t manage portraits  with control over the aperture  either manual or in portrait mode   i could blur out the scene behind my subject when shooting with the dxo one  this depth of field effect was particularly useful in a marina  where i wanted to suggest location but not worry about my subject competing with a bunch of boats  portraits from an iphone alone look flatter and more jumbled action  the dxo one was able to stop the motion of a leaping dog when i increased my shutter speed  but there   s room for improvement  it takes more than four seconds between shots  so i missed some pooch acrobatics  dxo says a coming software update will allow it to take bursts of eight photos per second night  this is where the dxo one shines  picking up an incredible amount of city sparkle in landscapes and finding the right colors in low light restaurant food shots  the camera   s sensor is smaller than most dslrs     but for night photography it makes up for it with a    superraw    mode that combines four images into one beautiful shot   you have to open these files with dxo software on a computer to process them  video  like an iphone    the dxo one captures full hd video  but it produces a greater dynamic range  while recording  you can tap on the phone screen to shift the focus or exposure  there   s no way to manually adjust aperture and iso on video today  but dxo says that   s also on its road map i should be clear about where the dxo one didn   t really make a difference  well lit landscapes  the iphone   already does a fantastic job with these  including a high dynamic range  hdr  mode that automatically balances scenes with lots of lights and darks   dxo doesn   t have an hdr mode now  but it   s working on it  and the tiny dxo one does  of course  bear a few compromises  unlike a dslr  you can   t swap the dxo one   s lenses to go telephoto or extra wide   at least not yet  they built threads onto its front for potential future lens attachments the biggest downside to the dxo one is its battery  which is sealed and can   t be swapped out for a spare  in my tests  the camera lasted for just about two hours of heavy use  dxo says it should be able to take about     photos  and it shuts off automatically to save power  still  i ended up traveling with a power brick to give it a boost on the go the battery challenges don   t overshadow the incredible leap forward made by the dxo one  even as phone makers like apple pour resources into making their cameras better  the sheer size of the dxo one   s lens and sensor make it hard to top in the near future  mobile photography and pro level photography are no longer a contradiction  write to geoffrey a
