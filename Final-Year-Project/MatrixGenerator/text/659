   these dishes brim with the city   s international spirit    
in recent years  london  arguably the most international city in the world  has become an international culinary destination as well  while it may come as a surprise to those still clinging to the notion that this city is the capital of bland  stodgy meals  the last    years have seen a revolution of sorts in london dining  arriving during brexit week was inescapably poignant for me  as i   d come to town to meet with british publishers about    the london cookbook     published this week in north america by ten speed press    a book i was inspired to write precisely because the city   s restaurants had recently become so eclectic and international in scope  over several years i   d watched the bar rise not only at the better known  high end restaurants but also at the tiniest of sandwich shops and the hole in the wall bakeries  the city appeared to be in a veritable feeding frenzy  everyone was talking food  and i don   t mean scones and clotted cream  but contemporary creations like the ras el hanout loaf on offer at the fernandez   wells caf  s scattered around central london   a marriage of moroccan spices  french pain d     pices and traditional english gingerbread best served not with tea but with a strong espresso  back in the     s  when i lived in paris  we   d pack french charcuterie and chocolate when we traveled to london  as the pickings across the channel would inevitably be slim  only a handful of restaurants in london were worth their exorbitant prices   the savoy being the most famous   alastair little being the most beloved  designer restaurateur terence conran changed the game when he opened bibendum in       the stars of that restaurant   s kitchen    simon hopkinson  jeremy lee  bruce poole and  matthew harris   started a movement  it gained force in      with the opening of the italianate river caf    and in      with the arrival on the scene of st  john  where chef  fergus henderson paired the best traditional british cooking with an all french wine list  celebrity chef and river caf   alum  jamie oliver then upended the staid and frumpy world of home cooking with his television series    the naked chef     and  nigella lawson brought her own irreverent style to come hither cookbooks such as    how to be a domestic goddess     more recently  yotam ottolenghi has given london   s food scene another shot in the arm at his eponymous gourmet delis  with vivid dishes grounded in the recipes of his native israel  london food today has the reach of an empire without the colonialist attitude that for so long kept english food surprisingly provincial  the chefs at restaurants such as moro  nopi   andrew edmunds  honey   co  and the clove club reach for exotic ingredients liberally and with a sure hand  over the week following the brexit vote  as i saw londoners happily eating spanish tapas  portuguese sandwiches and north african tagines  i breathed easier  this was the one city in england that voted to remain in the european union  its inhabitants    zeal for the foods of the world reflects a deeply rooted cosmopolitanism  just look at the recipe above  for cod enlivened with baharat  a warming middle eastern spice blend  as served at the modern pantry in clerkenwell  or the kakuni  a pork belly braised in sake  mirin rice wine and british hard cider  at koya bar in soho  or that moroccan spiced loaf at fernandez   wells  noted above  these dishes brim with the city   s international spirit  whatever the long term effects of this summer   s vote on other aspects of british life  it   s too late to suppress londoners    appetite for what lies across the channel and beyond
