articles picasso portraits review face to many faces with a modern master            london it   s likely that any  pablo picasso             show will assure the exhibiting museum of high visitor numbers  nevertheless  such a project requires the sisyphean task of plowing through the work of one of art history   s most prolific and protean artists  so it   s a relief that the judicious selection of    works in    picasso portraits     which recently opened at the national portrait gallery  is tighter and more focused than the     plus works in moma   s memorable      picasso portraiture survey  it   s a persuasive case for the    less is more    advice that npg guest curator  elizabeth cowling  a university of edinburgh emeritus professor and picasso authority  says she was given during the planning  and  presumably  winnowing  process  the resulting manageable  and even somewhat unexpected  picasso survey includes works both familiar and previously unexhibited in a range of mediums  deftly organized in a chronological  yet also topical  installation a perceptive teenage self portrait of       executed while picasso was studying art in barcelona  asserts the maturity of his juvenilia  this  in turn  prepares us for the constant shifting of depictive modes with which the artist  over the course of his lifetime  shocked and delighted viewers while concurrently confounding curators and scholars  a large and familiar  completely different  self portrait of      not only channels  c  zanne but also prepares us for picasso   s lifelong dialogue with other artists  seen throughout the show  even while he was being very self consciously inventive   by the time of his      cubist portrait of noted art dealer daniel henry kahnweiler  the artist has forcefully challenged our understanding of portraiture   s possibilities  reportedly the outcome of    to    sittings  the kahnweiler image fuses an assemblage of tonal geometric forms in so called analytic cubism  the most radical painting of the day  with the most conventional pose of a gentleman in waistcoat with watch chain  hands clasped  sitting for his portrait  it   s astonishing to note how far picasso has moved from the several      portraits on view  which range from suggestions of  toulouse lautrec to the brilliantly colored smirking image of bibi la pur  e  the    king of bohemia    in artistic paris the stylistic shifts here mirror most  if not all  of picasso   s visual peregrinations  the intense luminescence of his countenance raises the    portrait of sebasti   junyer i vidal           from the melancholy of most blue period works  even while the prostitute next to the sitter keeps the mood dour  and this face also suggests one of the exhibition   s great strengths in taking a serious look at picasso as caricaturist  so that both scribbles and more finished drawings are interspersed with grander paintings  each informing the other  for those of us who have long admired the sure  often minimal  lines with which picasso seems able to bring almost anything to life  it   s especially revealing to observe the slight shifts in detail of ink or pencil that infuse his humorous  sometimes even cruel  observations of friends only occasionally does this transfer to larger  more finished work  as we see in what may well be the most emotionally pungent room here  picasso met the ukrainian ballerina  olga khokhlova  a highly visible part of paris   s artistic world who danced with diaghilev   s ballets russes  when he was working on designs for    parade    in       he married her in       and of the many women and muses in the artist   s life  olga provided the opportunity for the most romantic portraits in this exhibition  with one gallery devoted to her  it   s not simply the artist   s radical return to a kind of classicism in his painting that makes these works so appealing  early film footage shows picasso and olga  and their son and dog  playing in their garden  but the serenely elegant and beautiful olga of the portraits here   especially the      and      images   appears to be a wholly different person from the relatively homely lady on film that reminds us of the transformative power of a formal portrait  and it   s why this exhibition resonates so wonderfully in the context of the national portrait gallery  one wishes  probably in vain  that visitors would trek upstairs to play the experience of this picasso exhibition against the array of portraits from the   th century forward that describe both english history itself and the history of art  because in painting  sculpture  photography and film  characterizations of people are as much about who is creating the image as about the person portrayed  a picasso portrait exhibition makes that case with special force  sometimes we are seeing people through his eyes  at other times we are really seeing picasso through the way in which he presents people   even himself   to us  as in the morbid      self portrait drawing that suggests an awareness of his imminent end  in confronting the shock of recognition   or not   we come to terms with how the artist manipulates our sensibilities  so although the excellent catalog guides us through much more than the exhibition itself  this show is less about becoming acquainted with the people in picasso   s life   his personal and artistic friends  and his various women   fernande olivier  olga   marie th  r  se walter  dora maar  fran  oise gilot and  jacqueline roque   than it is about expanding our understanding of portraiture and a familiar artist who excelled at it in more ways than we had previously imagined  mr  freudenheim  a former art museum director  served as the assistant secretary for museums at the smithsonian
