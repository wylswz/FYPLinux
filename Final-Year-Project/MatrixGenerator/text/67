go to ani seo relat site or forum on the web and it s easi to notic that link build tactic are still among the most talk about subject in the realm of seo today site like moz search engin land and even our own googl plu commun strateg social network are fill with endless articl surround the art of link build the subject of build link in hope of churn out a better rank often remain at the top of the averag search optim s to do list the still common and heavi focu on obtain link in hope of obtain promin search placement is not without merit though a googl still seem to put tremend weight on rank when it come to dofollow link so the question remain do googl s search algorithm compel peopl to spam link in hope of rank i d not onli make a sure bet they do but i m go to explain whi despit googl s claim of put import on the qualiti of content author and influenc when it come to rank content it appear all these metric continu to take a backseat to the tradit dofollow link the problem is it appear googl ha creat an endless cycl of link builder who spend their day scout for link rather than focus their time and energi on creat content that peopl will realli enjoy to make matter wors have a web full of content that s rank base on link destroy the public s trust in the content it consum and it s becaus the world ha come to assum that much of what they interact with on the web wa somehow manipul by it creator in the hope their content will rank it doesn t take but a hand of search to understand how googl rank content today the first thing to note about googl s organ search algorithm is the fact they tend to put a stronger emphasi on rank domain more so than even content or peopl thi is easi to tell by the fact that top publish still domin the bulk of googl s page one list i see noth wrong with rank certain domain over other but not when they re serv mass junk to the public while googl s algorithm have greatli improv in recent year sorri to say the search giant leaf a lot to be desir with it search result the unfortun truth is that a larg major of googl s current page one content wa somehow manipul with link in order to obtain a desir placement in effect serv user with useless content and idea that never belong there to begin with half of all click i make on page one of googl often lead to content full of vagu statement and useless a clear sign of the link manipul tactic that continu to plagu their organ search result to thi veri day the bigger question here is whi doe googl continu to cling to it belov link the answer is quit simpl they re protect corpor america includ their friend in high place the fact is despit googl s claim to just creat qualiti content what they don t tell potenti blogger and other content creator is the dire truth that they re actual set up for failur befor they ever got start here googl tout advanc algorithm that can spot high qualiti content a focu on natur languag with hummingbird and advanc in a i that are supposedli alreadi bake into their search algorithm then you have the panda algorithm which supposedli wa googl s attempt to lower the rank of low qualiti site fill with thin content too bad thi algorithm never pan out the way the world hope it would a googl continu to serv junk content to the web s audienc regardless of panda then you have googl s penguin the search algorithm gear toward weed out link spammer that despit numer updat still doesn t seem to do it intend job the ultim truth is that googl rank content almost sole base on link which serf to prop up the major publish and dump everyon els in the trash if you have lot of relev dofollow link you can rank all over page one of googl search and join the big leagu of publish regardless of the qualiti of your content at present the medium giant of the web still reign in power thank to a set of search algorithm that make it next to imposs for anyon els to compet unless you re cheat that is given the fact that googl still put tremend weight in it rank algorithm base sole on link the qualiti of one s content then becom irrelev it doesn t matter how much peopl like your content or how much better it is becaus googl and other have set you up for complet failur right from the start if i were to look at the highest rank content on my own websit all the page in question rank sole becaus they have relev doffollow link point back to them epic fail for googl thi is a terribl way to rank content on the modern web and they know it when peopl search the web for answer to nag problem they expect honest input from credibl sourc yet googl serf them with one articl after anoth that fail to explain who author the content or where it even came from put plainli it s a guess game with googl either way content that can not be verifi should not be serv in search result period how are peopl suppos to know they re receiv accur answer to their problem when they have no way to verifi the credibl of the author or the content be serv rank with link is just googl s way of play dumb and pretend they can t understand content the way human do so they base the valu of content on the link point to it the fact is there s much better way to identifi the qualiti of content on the web and the answer lie in the convers that travers the internet peopl often talk about what interest them what they feel is right or wrong who is trust worthi and who is not what they like or dislik googl know what s popular what s honest and who s credibl but link continu to prevail anyway if googl were to stop rank with link the result would honestli be disastr a half of all major publish would fall off the grid in search result and googl know it for now we re stuck with a web full of articl about how to obtain authorit back link to your crappi content that no one want whether googl want to admit it or not their search rank remain heavili manipul by the tradit dofollow link in order to protect their corpor buddi from an econom standpoint googl s current rank algorithm are also a disast to america s economi a they serv to funnel all of the web s wealth right back to the publish elit forc everyon els into dire poverti link and spam besid the fact that rank algorithm gear toward link have the propens to deliv internet user with fals inform that will caus them more harm than good rank with a focu on link also compel mani in the content product world to spam link in an effort to stay ahead of the competit googl s usual respons to link spam is to penal the culprit with both manual and autom algorithm penalti while the method of screen for dishonest link ha work to some degre those who know what they re do can easili circumv googl s current safeguard that remain in place if link are divers relev and look origin googl will respond by pass pagerank upon said link a if they were vouch for by the site owner they came from it s a system that s clearli easi to game earlier thi year the subject of build link seem to catch the attent of googl s john meuller who state when it come to build link he doesn t recommend it yet everi blogger seo and publish on the web know they can t rank without them rememb how i state that googl rank base on link to defend their corpor friend you see there s more to all of thi than just link besid deal with an internet full of link spammer who never stood a chanc against big medium anyway the way that googl play favorit with some publish over other is obviou in the fact they continu to rank spammi site at the top of page one of their search result especi in the case of major publish the bigger medium player have been known to spam their site with so mani ad they lock up the user browser serv auto play video and serv a ton of ad abov the fold despit googl s insist they would take action against those who were do so the major player oper with impun to give an exampl earlier thi year i went to forb in the morn hour one day to read the latest headlin onli to realiz the site wa so ridden with so mani auto play video and ad galor it actual lock up my entir browser complet yet despit the spam of advertis forb continu to domin page one of googl search thi is a clear exampl of how googl prop up the big player regardless of their action in the case of forb i took the liberti of contact them and explain what they were do wa not accept hour later they made site wide chang and that wa the end of it while i honor forb for take quick action to fix the problem plagu visitor to it site how were they abl to get away with thi for so long and still continu to hold a grip on page one of search result to show how much of a problem the art of chase link ha becom here s one exampl of a recent articl from search engin land author by juli joyc who state quot we all want and need link the sad and sorri truth is that she s definit right you can check out that articl here take thi link and shove it that articl publish on june the st of is the normal scenario you ll see when it come to discuss about seo on the modern day web it s also onli one of mani articl publish daili to the internet that talk sole about link how much we need them and how we practic can t live without them go to our social network commun strateg social network on googl and search for back link or link build and there s virtual a never end stream of post relat to link in gener so mani post in fact it would probabl take me year to sift through them all and reach the bottom of the pile just to note how signific thi problem ha becom rank on googl v googl search when it come to rank on googl the game chang complet instead of rank base on link googl look at engag metric such a s share and comment a well a overal popular a strong signal of trust and qualiti with thi platform engag is the holi grail of obtain the visibl one desir across the platform on googl it s easi to see who s content is use honest and worthi of an audienc s attent and it s all becaus googl give weight to those who stand out and thi go for brand and peopl alik also when it come to rank googl let the commun decid what s worthi and what is not my question is whi on earth doesn t googl appli these veri effect rank algorithm to their standard search engin a well when it come to googl if peopl realli like what you have to offer there you will get ton of visibl a a result sad to say what peopl like on the web isn t necessarili what rank in googl s standard search result conclus it s time for googl to stop play dumb and play favorit with major publish who serv the web with one useless idea after anoth while i would agre that link should still remain an integr part of googl s search algorithm it s a metric that shouldn t hold the enorm weight it current doe while we ve seen some improv in the qualiti of googl s search result more need to be done to balanc link with more identifi metric of trust influenc and author that help to rise meaning and use idea to the top of serp again there s better way to identifi the qualiti and relev of content and the answer lay in tune down the heavili manipul dofollow link and focus more on what peopl actual have to say about someth my thought is if the world doesn t march in tune with an idea then googl shouldn t either written and publish by daniel imbellino co founder of strateg social network mani thank for read and be sure to check out
