income strategist at csas bought     things for joining us kathy thanks for having me i m a nice town high income investing grater for bands     so let s talk about what investors can do with rates so low to generate income     aam you know i think there s some rests that people can go too far looking for yield     what s the best of the lilac concerned that people just focus on a hill then down focus on how to get to that yield around the whole portfolio     so i are philosophy is that in your fixed income portfolio that the core holdings like seventy five area the percentage should be     he and high quality bonds and right now we think the intermediate term of bonds meaning five to ten years of average     maturity duration     as a way to go     to high quality bonds and intermediate term variation it will make your reaction to improving income     but it will deliver some some solid income out of the police files     and what i like the intermediate term in section of the best income for the mess and that s exactly the way we look at the yield curve is steep meaning church or a very very low and then     of rates go up pretty quickly app from the near zero to about five to seven year maturity so it s been a seperate and then it tends to flatten out a little busy given to longer term bonds     which leads to get the most income for years every ask why in that middle part and the park and look and income levels should people be     shooting for ecb should they be expecting nine yet its hard to know what they should expect or i     so if the risk free rate is a no on one quarter of one percent     and you re getting high heels are taking some sort of     grade three aspects i think it thinking that proportion to what the risk free rate this and so in the intermediate term bond funds these days if it has some corporate credit limit meaning investment grade bonds     is probably getting ill the north of two percent     on it s not going to be fantastic     but     they will generate steady income and your reinvest any and     what the for people who say india look at their retirement savings now like i need at least     seven percent     income to live off what should they fail that s     probably unrealistic in this environment so we like the look of the whole portfolio so in your     on the equity portion of their portfolio probably have some dividend paying stocks seem a son     the reit s an mlp is generating income for a portion of it and then you have the bonds     to look at the total income from the portfolio     and then some cancer than half the probably take some principle meaning when you rebalance because something s come up on mormon     some summing oust     rebalance e mail allocate those capital gains and use that as part of your     of     your income stream     anandtech one arrest     i will tell tell us about a few funds the state worked well for that corner     exchange your question so this come from our
