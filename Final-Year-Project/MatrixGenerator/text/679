articles pierre audi provocateur makes his mark in new york this fall           for new yorkers curious about the impresario taking the reins at park avenue armory  one of the city   s most provocative multidisciplinary arts spaces  this month offers a few intriguing sneak peeks   pierre audi has forged a more than three decade career in europe as an opera and theater director known for actively embracing cutting edge artists and techniques   while also breathing new life into classics  among his innovations  putting the orchestra directly onstage surrounded by the singers during   wagner   s    ring    cycle  and staging a one woman opera based on a  samuel beckett libretto without a story or any characters known for his adventurous sensibilities and collaborations with visual artists at dutch national opera  the holland festival and elsewhere  mr  audi has been camping out in new york in recent weeks  rehearsing with the metropolitan opera on oct     his production of    guillaume tell      rossini   s epic  rarely performed opera about the rebellious swiss folk hero  will be presented at the met  where the work hasn   t been seen for more than    years  this week  mr  audi is also staging    circle map     a program of immersive music by the contemporary finnish composer kaija saariaho  the new york philharmonic  conducted by esa pekka salonen  will perform it thursday and friday at the armory   s historic        square foot drill hall    he   s one of the top people in the field  and is this kind of double threat because he   s not only the head of an opera company  he   s a director as well     said  peter gelb  the met   s general manager  who has known mr  audi for years     he   s stimulated by works that are outside the typical repertory canon     take    guillaume tell     which is one of several pieces co produced by the met and dutch national opera  rossini   s last opera  the      work is considered by some to be his masterpiece  it is also long   upward of four hours   difficult to cast and places significant demands on the orchestra and chorus    i thought it was such a fascinating piece   almost unstageable     mr  audi  whose production had its premiere in      in amsterdam  said earlier this month     how do you do it    don   t expect painted alpine backdrops or medieval costumes  when the curtain rises after the famous overture  mr  audi offers up a stripped down  abstracted staging intended to highlight the opera   s universal themes of liberty  loyalty and betrayal  the architectural sets  by his frequent collaborator  george tsypin  are meant to evoke the shape of chalets with being overly literal the    circle map    concerts were already in the pipeline before he arrived at the armory last year  as of last week mr  audi was still working out the specifics of what the audience would encounter inside the organization   s vast space  he calls the process    mise en espace      putting a work in space using elements such as lighting  video or deciding where people sit    we try to get the audience to surround the orchestra     he said  to break down the barriers between performers and listeners     it   s organizing these ingredients  using one   s experience to shape them  that motivates me     fluent in english  french and dutch  he is accustomed to juggling continents and creative endeavors  he is also now  at age     balancing the needs of a family  he married in june of       the same month his appointment at the armory was announced  he and his wife have a young daughter and a second child on the way family  he said  provides    an additional layer of humanity and helped me to manage the stress a little bit better    born in beirut  mr  audi grew up there and in france  after studying history at oxford university  he founded london   s almeida theatre in a once derelict salvation army hall  where he presented experimental theater and introduced british audiences to  john cage  arvo p  rt and other contemporary composers in      mr  audi was hired to lead dutch national opera  he was just    years old  with no traditional opera experience  mr  audi ultimately put the young company on the map  with premieres of new operas and by working with boundary pushing cultural figures ranging from the artist  anish kapoor to american theater director  peter sellars and the chinese composer  tan dun  from      to      he served as artistic director of the holland festival  and has directed productions for opera and theater companies across europe  he plans to step down as director of the dutch company in       when he will assume leadership of france   s famed aix en provence music festival  mr  audi already knows many of the major players in new york   s cultural scene  as he ramps up his work for the next armory season  he is diving in deeper  making frequent visits here and meeting young new york based artists the armory  which opened in       gets the benefit of mr  audi   s vast international rolodex     he has worked with so many musicians  composers  conductors  directors     said  rebecca robertson  the armory   s president and executive producer     you get this kind of encyclopedia of the avant garde     write to jennifer smith at jennifer smith wsj com
