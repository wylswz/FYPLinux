articles telluride good movies welcome back            telluride  colo  either no one has noticed or no one has complained  but for longer than i   ve chosen to admit   at least publicly   my annual roundups from this lovely little town in the rocky mountains have followed the same template  and the same emotional arc     after a grim summer at the movies  the telluride film festival has restored my faith in the medium with a program that included  insert appropriate titles  plus short but hopefully pungent descriptions     the template still applies  though with ominous adjustments  grim can   t begin to convey the essence of this year   s soul chilling summer at the movies  a near interminable stretch of stinkers with precious few signs of life from mostly clueless studios  telluride has provided reason for hope  as always  but hope tempered by an awareness that the theatrical medium is increasingly threatened by a whole constellation of cultural forces   a crucial trend that usually eludes industry analysts is young people   s resistance to the notion of spending two hours in a public space where they   re not supposed to talk or check their mobile devices  whereas tv  streaming services and youtube offer them a choice of binging on their favorite shows and movies or consuming them in small doses   all the more reason  then  for movie lovers to cherish and support the good stuff as never before  and some of the features at telluride this year weren   t just good but  dare i say it  perfect in their various fashions first and foremost for me in the perfection category was  kenneth lonergan   s     manchester by the sea      a searingly beautiful film set in a boston suburb starring  casey affleck   a perfect performance   as a closed down loner who has suffered terrible loss and may or may not find his way back to embracing life  perfection on a different scale  in a different place   europe in the wake of world war i   is achieved by  fran  ois ozon   s    frantz     a drama that poses the same question in the person of a grief stricken young woman played exquisitely by  paula beer  if there   s a false note in    graduation     a romanian film by  cristian mungiu  i didn   t notice it   i found only truth and humanity in the tale of a decent man who loses his moral compass when he tries to enhance his daughter   s chances of getting into a prestigious college the most obvious category for    moonlight    is black film  or more accurately great black film   but even that doesn   t do justice to this second feature by  barry jenkins  a profoundly moving study of a frightened  near silent young boy coming into manhood in contemporary miami and shutting himself off from a long ago love  there are many passing marvels in    moonlight     but the most remarkable thing about mr  jenkins   s movie is how vividly you can see  at the end of an almost total transformation  the tender child in the flint hardened man the festival was graced with a trio of strong documentaries about jazz   john scheinfeld   s    chasing trane    evokes the career of the singular saxophone virtuoso  john coltrane  janus k  ster rasmussen   s    cool cats    amounts to parallel portraits of two superb saxophonists   ben webster and  dexter gordon  at a time in the     s when both men fled racism and a failing jazz scene in america for the frigid weather and warm welcome of copenhagen  while it   s technically correct to call    i called him morgan    a documentary   kasper collin   s brilliant film plays like first rate drama as it tells the tragic story of  lee morgan  he   s the bop trumpet prodigy who died of wounds after his common law wife  helen more  shot him on a snowy night in      in a jazz club in new york   s east village  the tragedy was shared  helen  as the movie makes clear  was a compelling figure in her own right  a woman of depth and passion who rose from rural poverty in north carolina in a tactical departure from its traditional role as a high altitude brigadoon for cinephiles  the festival featured a mainstream hollywood production that goes into wide release this week   clint eastwood   s     sully      which stars  tom hanks as chesley sullenberger  the pilot who landed his airliner in the hudson river in       the tactic is debatable  but    sully    is very good  and i   ve reviewed it at greater length in the online journal  a debut film at the festival   otto bell   s    the eagle huntress     will open theatrically toward the end of october  when my review will run in this space  here again the technical category is documentary   the subject is a    year old kazakh girl  aisholpan  who yearns to become the first female eagle hunter in her family of nomads on the immense mongolian steppe  i have some reservations about the film   s yearnings to become an inspirational feature  but the vistas and cultural insights are fascinating and aisholpan is simply  though not plainly  enchanting a sense of duty sent me to a couple of films that turned out to be exceptional  notwithstanding my misplaced doubts   pablo larra  n  the chilean director of the smart and exciting    no     has taken surreally poetic liberties in    neruda     which is set in       when chile   s celebrated poet and communist senator was charged with treason and went into hiding   he   s played by  luis gnecco   mr  larra  n   s political phantasmagoria is framed as a chase and told from the perspective of a beguilingly articulate cop  played by  gael garc  a bernal  who refuses to believe that he   s a supporting character  let alone a product of his quarry   s imagination  the running time of     toni erdmann     a german comedy by  maren ade  is almost three hours  yet every one of its     minutes is justified by the counterpoint between winfried  a falstaffian eccentric played with epic gusto by  peter simonischek  and his daughter  ines  a corporate executive played by  sandra h  ller  whose performance is no less remarkable for being a study of control freakery a presentation that runs more than three hours   bertrand tavernier   s    my journey through french cinema    had me mesmerized from start to finish  i thought i was fairly well versed in the great films of france   my cinema journey began in earnest when the french new wave hit american shores   but i had lots of other thinks coming as mr  tavernier  the filmmaker who directed dexter gordon in       round midnight     made his way through decades of lore with the scrupulous judgments of a scholar and the zest of an unquenchable fan  i   d also had more than a casual acquaintanceship with czech cinema  but none of it prepared me for the joyous originality of  karel zeman   s      feature    the  fabulous baron munchausen     a live action animation hybrid  gorgeously restored  that opened up possibilities and provided artistic templates for such subsequent innovators as  ray harryhausen  terry gilliam  tim burton and  wes anderson the danger of reveling in great films of the past is nostalgia  their moments are gone  and will never return in the same form  but nostalgia got surprising new twists from two films that could hardly differ more in form or content one of them is    california typewriter     a documentary by  doug nichol  it   s about typewriters  exactly as you guessed  along with people who love them  continue to fix them  the film takes its name and focus from a typewriter shop in berkeley   and collect them  the lovers  and users  include  david mccullough  sam shepard and  john mayer  the collectors include tom hanks  who was ubiquitous at the festival in the flesh as well as on the screen  the point of it all isn   t just nostalgia  though i must say i was smitten anew by the sight of smith coronas  olympias  olivettis and selectrics i once owned  but the palpable pleasure of using a machine to put ink on pieces of paper that can outlast the fugitive data on a hard drive the other retro revelation  a lollipop colored musical called    la la land     was the hit of the festival  and no wonder  the writer director   damien chazelle     whiplash      has created a film so daringly retro that it looks and feels brand new   emma stone is mia  an aspiring actress who works in a coffee shop on the warner brothers lot   ryan gosling is sebastian  a jazz pianist who can   t make a living playing the music he loves  whatever nostalgia one may have for the glory days of hollywood musicals can   t conceal the fact that the co stars are less than consummate singers and dancers  and the score is far from sublime  but that doesn   t matter in the end   if you remember the winsome loveliness of    the umbrellas of cherbourg     you   ll understand why   what matters is the movie   s renewal of a promise that movies used to make as a matter of course   come see this and you   ll forget your cares and woes  that  as they used to say  is entertainment  write
