university professor     and and brother prolific author     as far     who has a new book out on actually um it s actually on the books is yet to be coming out on the eleventh of october eleven the     ne in the uk apps are gaining currency the rise of the renminbi     has four welcome to the pot     thank you for having you all     the ice and     probably should mention focused in the complete     to complete the meal of pork     you did read a blurb for for my     first post i wrote my casey so you and i am a small history together to pass the interests of anyone in the senate bill and     insiders want people to know the the sun or new unlike     here this interview in the talmud guy with him was that this this interview is on the up and     then     a i just wanna take that away     and also that the au force of is if i sound     ignorant it all it s it s because i am ignorant     i ve that it has actually read the book yet     we we really just got a chance to figure this out yesterday renewed his interview me so this is kind of     put together hastily but i will try to keep up my into the conversation     of those kind of pay     so explain to folks out there who might not be familiar with special drawing right to me i know that what is the significance of that for the chinese currency     so the imf son efficient currency and the special going i know this before     he d gotten seats in the winter to mention the u s dollar the japanese yen british pound sterling     and the euro     on oktoberfest this saturday the     item before you wonder if it is sometimes caused     me and sent to the basket of the league is a cut in fees     to symbolically it it s a momentous event it s momentous because china is still     a developing country although it is a middle income country and now the second largest economy in the world     but in terms of per capita income it s too far behind the of the advanced economies     so for an emerging market economies kuttin s seat to ascend into this in the basket     is assigned a china has severely     i m     put its prominence the right to dissent over the with economic state     but at the same there more to go to overstate the     importance of this many people have argued that this is going to be     a key unchanged in international finance that the item be     crittenden     by emailing the dollar     perhaps becoming one of the most important noble descent currencies because after all the chinese economy     is still going pretty fast     it snowed the second largest economy and was accosted about ten percent of     what credence to continuing to catch up to the     u s economy insights     i don t think it ll happen that can be i can be     he simply going to have aligned an interesting night for the coming years but i don t think it s going to become a dominant over the same courtesy     to some of the hype bolton negative hype     that the item be really collapsing in the short term     all the positive side the rmb is going to take over     both of those that think they re sort of overblown     now     this     is getting her name be into the nasty orange and gold attorneys for several years now     and are a couple times the imf said million ready we need is dismissed     on why why with the chinese so keen to have the line     this into this this     basket of currencies     imported chinese policymakers especially those in charge of the people s bank of china the chinese central bank     understand that again this is not going to begin to do because i ve directly china needs to have its economic policies diet     it meets or better financial markets before the yuan can become     a truly important global cotton seed but what the also recognizes that disc related videos a framework     for getting out of the all position to domestic defaults     from the bumper sticker the people s bank of china could be better to have     better functioning financial markets it would be better to have a market determined exchange rate and the more kept open capital account     because it makes the adobe s here in terms of using monthly policy     to achieve domestic objectives     the problem is that all of the sioux falls     bottom against baby significant risk of interest     but once the people of china and the leadership of china signed on to this notion     that getting the item be into the sdr basket would be a good thing for china     especially in terms of its this beach     back into the pboc the people s bank of china     the stock pushing forward a variety of defaults over the last year     that would basically be called the boxes the imf     had put before china     so many things that happened ousted including     measures to open up the capital accountable to no snow photos     the liberalization of the deposit interest rates so that     the entire industry structure     fees to banks is now in principle     completely determined by then another then the government     the     institution if an explicit deposit insurance scheme     although piece of good for china but in a note that happened but for the facundo was a framework     and an urgency to get things done     he added     it starts raising a bunch of questions but i thing i wanted to that i     think my piece them are related     on the first which is kind of to     ellie just get him after he can t or whatever or your first or just become of the fall into that is a blow to know what more to the need to do to truly in korea reserve currency     on and did the second one is what practical effects do you think this move will have     um no it in terms of world trade in terms of people s daily lives outside of these very small finance circles     on what he has a practical effect people can expect to see today and im moving down     the aisle its official improvement it is a wonderful thing to have for the chinese government and for the rmb     but it s not going to be a game changer overnight what i d do if he matches for home which faction     dependency gets in international finance that there was one highly easily foreign investors can get access to ten as markets     awaited given a post financial markets under the such timidity foreign investors need to be able to acquire     high quality of renminbi denominated assets     danone can open doors tended to snort have been given up and were the guinea to financial markets yet     so intimately that that s what china needs to global put its own sake     and for the sake of the item be them     and     getting some of that aam yet access     for access to china s markets     that s still an issue for investors who are     sadly that isn t always do it in terms of opening of the market and it s an interesting um     point affected although the currency isn t good the sdr basket one of the other thing the chinese government was hoping to achieve     this year in twenty sixteen what s to get that chinese a shares listed in the msci emerging markets index     but that won t happen because msci     to go much street discuss the safest of all you have to kick off all the boxes     that we have set for you to take off     and more important to     investors need to be persuaded     that to mean what you say     so for instance the chinese government said it s great to be easier for foreign investors     in china s bomb markets both corporate and government bond markets     to leave that to be a fun said they decided to certain investments     but investors are convinced sold     the item beeson gets to musket but the chinese dishes in not     in the msci index     i i let s let s take a break on that note and we will deliver this important message to you and will come right back     but benchmark side author of the new book gaining currency     ok now     i m quentin for trial to many markets in more we talk about them as fascination personal finance stories of the

sure trend back to the eu on their name be     worth anything is interesting is one of the party given to chinese started making in two thousand and nine what is that     look what happened to the global economy because of the dollar could you of one     sort of overarching reserve currency     it s dangerous to just have one we really should have more than one     oh by the way we have one folder name be     on the twenty when you make of that argument that having warned that     serve global currency is     can be a problem     it can potentially be a problem because of the of the u s has been able to go to the tibia and a simple and economic policies because     the rest of the was just willing to finance the us government to     a budget deficits and current account deficits but buying up a huge amount of u s government debt     so if the us dollar did not have such a prominent role     especially asus ee cave and cut and see     maybe     they would be     i m less ability of the us     to sort of fed on and disciplined economic policies and if the chinese see it also today by the havoc on the international financial system     now the question is why is the u s and its dominant position in one piece and of course this is its economic science but it also has the baby b     and     m ostensibly where they can lead to financial markets     and in international finance a really interesting isn t it to its north of the u s it s the patterned on     of good wishes in terms of financial markets and the commission but it s certainly better     than what this note that in most other countries     china feels that it has been financing u s current account deficits and     the unfortunate thing for china s that because of the tenancy policies     that led to a particular schamotta foreign exchange reserves     in order to stimulate the pot but in u s treasury securities     which are giving them a lousy mood     um so they feel trapped in the situation and     i think they would like to assert the more economic dominance     aam and the field of the u s gets in the way yes i think     i think you know will no matter what you ll think of of of china and government leadership and and and and a lot of issues of human rights issues alone are significant     i m always amazed by how lead us to stay on as a nation as a people know the turn of mind to something     and they they just they just cuddled really into being and in part of me in turning the leinenkugel reserve currencies     is along those lines     i also think it s interesting that     carry the look of the dollar and you look at the sort of him in the post world war two     fine cool financial structure for was all that you know     you had a relatively     new nike s your post here posted in stephen j     p a relatively stable to financial set up for the globe after world war two financial crisis comes along and all the nutty of some some challenges to that     on the chinese commanded a local it to its return in the     global currency also in the city walk on a     day for a little of the dollar s power as political stuff in there as well     but     the idea and i think it s insane     you look at the way the financial them from global franta friends     for infrastructure think is changing     and     to dive thing about when you are coming in more ways that that s reflected i think is you know they re     they re so read books now about money     the village had been but it seems to intimate to me because where i m kind of in the circle now to seems like there there s a lot more home     i mean you know this one now about the renminbi of one just a year ago     called the dollar trap     felix martin has had his book out i wrote that poem     it was a point above by kabbee or seagal     the evolution of money by a phablet has a book on the universe to press tv or foreign roman     cult they     also get the first five dozen years to cramer s book which is beyond specific money but     to tune out that     do you think that we re in a period     of     of of significant change in terms of     you just ask the question of what is money and what was actually under the kurds the financial system     in fact are able to start over chinese martin prehistory which goes way back back to two hundred bc when many of the issues about     the value of money that could be bitten today were being debated by chinese callers     it also does so that china in fact issued the first paper currency in the one     you the song dynasty in the seventh century the     m b     a b     aam kovel icahn has been opened the makings of marco polo came up with the first pf tenancy     paper tennessee that was knocked back by commodities are precious metals     is the marco polo reported on the yes marco polo reported that gugle icon manage to make it to the tenancy essentially by saying     that anybody has to mean for did not accept the tendency would be put to bed which is one takeaway is making a tendency of the tenancy     but of course money has come a long way since then in your bike and then a big change is afoot you back about some of these in     your book with the my casey on the     bitcoin     and it could     be going to see a divergence in the functions of money     aam bitcoin and many other aam     digital and the national cut into selected to become more important this medium soup exchange runes of a cult     says he won t be intermediate create in financial transactions     such assessing all i caught isis sony s online all of these content to be in dollars     like most of any cheap to create and on it s it s the most liquid hadn t seen     but the identities catching up many of the tendencies to catching up     aam and in fact the chinese was so frustrated not only that the     um because he was an importer would be also ahead tonight for the incandescent sentiment on swift     which     is controlled by the us to bits of appeal for payment system right now that china     into bank payment system     which is going to start domestic would convey the easily be skewed up     aam to an international payment system can replace fifty even intensive messaging     aam but the question is whether all of these could displace     the safe haven aspect of a currency which is the store to value function     not that sway institutions become very important because for that     you need not just of goat payment system but you also need     that cuts to foreign investors and an arguable this is made them in b within its limits     then mimi called becomes a significant reserve currency it     chinese policymakers believe it cuts right they are putting into its economic and financial market to post     but this has seen jumping ascent politico     the government has to do so the phone so off the table     therefore they argue that     didn t mean because whoever become a reserve currency perhaps even a significant is the tendency     accounting for five to ten percent of global foreign exchange reserves     but this little because they didn t become a safe haven currency one that investors don t go for safety during times of financial deloitte     sucking the dollars saved at least in that i mentioned how     they have the attention on the     flip side of the chinese argument that having     just one global reserve currency can be dangerous because the country s problems     get transmitted around the world it through the currency     the flip side of that is     will look to china     and if if you know     it gets the issue of trustees trust that china s markets are open to trust that your money is safe there     you know i ve i ve been waiting for china have a major crisis for late     twelve fifteen years i mean people been talking about this right     all day     they they have this this     absolute internal friction of the trend had a     the government that has complete control over the economy with a try may feel kind of open markets     is there there s a friction there people been waiting for that kind of     hopefully not literally but at least figuratively come a time lol often and become     a problem people we for china to nail down the city s     economy is fundamentally unsound of government paper nor have     all these issues     that i think the harder with a molecule of up to trusting of currency is safe haven     the final question there was enough is actually     email me all on what you said them     and that is a fundamental contradiction in china they know that they re trying to put in place mike according to the position and reforms     but they don t want to give it stability and control     is it will fundamentally contradictory impulses     so as an academic it s fascinating for me to see     these conflicting impulses trying to be the consent and video for what you get     on the steps and stumble toward piece on the stock market last year     and in the currency markets to its kinda rushed into early this year     all seen those of the is still fundamentally contradictory impulses cannot be beacon st     if you want my kids to what you have to let the word heading up to have a good     institute those supporting architecture you need     good corporate governance and firms in the quarter or dipping in accounting standards     and in each color coded and government constancy     even when it comes to things like beat china doesn t have any of these     but despite all of that china is still a pretty decent a growing economy     so people will go there for diversification and healing     the question is whether they will go there for safety and that ran through the snow     and to go back to the first going to mean     the fun things about the financial crisis one thing     that may have made it much worse it even among the voters of tendencies of them     and at that time when trust even in the most the time     longstanding of institutions was feeding it into one currency the dollar     is a vivid the custard and gold pool     perhaps things would have the in the last words     the flip side of the cycle and of course is that because of their daughter s pregnancy     nordic imbalances that dip in the financial system     but to end the crisis that     hit a mighty one dollars     and because the fed had to divinity and the cost of the international financial community     they could basically provide an infinite supply of dollars which     made things in the last words and     yet i mean it s in sch thing     in eltham now     declined for a second two are     you still have this means to have     people saying what is it and different courts come out with rulings in the state is money it isn t money     and taxi agencies come out and say it is money is mine     and i think it s     ideal can cause a quest to people didn t understand that point but any now it s more a question of i need     to really do think that uniter of money is changing and     use to have a lot of different roles tied up in one currency     i think we re starting to see servitude technology that     you can have     some of those roles can be     can be serviced when up and using different things certainly the of the exchange of passes damages to     a mechanism for transferring value that can be changed we may not have a safe haven at the same time     i think some of that     is changing     but i also think what you re here please range about     just the dollar and the fact that you have so much behind the dollar on a global basis mean     touches that that that is a large liquid currency     you have markets that it has been     built up around it for decades     and it     does something they can t be dislodged overnight that a lot of the quarter s thought you know in twenty thirteen to fourteen oh we ve got a better mousetrap and     to build in eight months for the rule the world     and it just didn t happen     because is     human nature being what it is people trust things and work for them in the past     i think     as much i see change happening     you also he hasn t had     as if the chinese government is from     you you have a     aam     it killed assorted get over their own preconceived notions     and when something works for them up     they feel safer that they can carpool with it they re just going to keep using     matousek selector pincus a medium of exchange is the unit of account to see big changes coming over the next ten years     it ll be much easier to sound sexy between consumers and producers     investors in one country and recipients of that investment another country which help using the standard sort of eco cotton sees the beanie use to     but again this question about the store evaluate can work money     alm so that you feel that it does seem to have your getting a great return     it s nice to see if the pockets to ensure     that at the open on change to babysit because that requires     a functioning government tim cook public institutions including     the cost of independent central bank did little for all     and     i m     and chicks and balances     and an open system of government that are necessary to maintain faith in the tenancy     the u s dollar that in most is that the deceased they have bad in fact     the distinction between it is as good as seen as his human tendency     did not really exist i e     i give it is the committee report the that came in basically a     although that is of currencies have these considers that to be it s a dimension     to the item beats trying to become a suet in it is said is a tendency     we ll see if it works and on my suspicion again     is it given china s xi and ecomomic code in science     and how it nobody has     wants to be friends in china because     so many countries the strong preventing financial emissions in china     that they want to     maintain and indeed f austin     aam you will get the item be becoming     an important international tendency but again     aam assays sci fi of incumbency     i don t see it didn t mean be all or     digital or convincing courting bitcoin     and the lifting of the go now and nine     don t mind his range stories to write about but yet can contribute     on     a tirade     was going to go but i find that i don t think     you actually     on oprah specifically made this point but     i d     i see another please read spoken in some ways you mention     the renminbi has become a reserve currency     in you know it s not just     on data to be need the special drawing rights to this if they had been renting has become a reserve currency tuna to an extent already right     better still remarkable thing about today when b will typically the prerequisites for that is a cut in seiyu springs code     having a company being market determined under the control exchange rate     and an open capital accounts of foreign and domestic investors can move capital     easily in a note of the country     china doesn t have either the bespoke on baby     it s become it is a tendency with     many central banks that own the was holding up the business of portfolios     united receptivity smallish edinburgh voters simple for us     maybe one to two percent but still feel the notion has been that if china doesn t meet the prerequisites in his own baby     but the fact that is the tendency when they actually opened the capital a company actually have a flexible exchange rate     maybe it would be color     bets with the hype is overblown     the nikkei david tonight in the economic front     and the item be could become an important is the currency if all of that happens     but it is going to let go and do not tighten the dollar     right right     but still shows how much     things changing in the last five to seven years     probably will be more change in the future     we will leave it there as corporate side thank you for coming in today appreciated     it s been my principal     to build book is called gaining currency the rise of the
