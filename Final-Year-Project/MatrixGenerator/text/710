articles away by okkervil river review somber stories and a cause for joy           though    away     ato  doesn   t arrive until friday  okkervil river   s will sheff has already seen a narrative imposed on his latest work  it   s true  he recorded    away    with guest musicians following the band   s breakup  and it   s true  his beloved grandfather died while he was writing it  but the album isn   t about either of those events    so much of this record is about me letting go     the    year old said by phone last week     it   s about getting back to a place of magic    one of the year   s best albums     away    is a superior collection of chamber folk and folk rock performed splendidly and thoughtfully by mr  sheff  jazz double bassist  noah garabedian  guitarist will graefe  keyboardist  jared samuel and members of the chamber ensemble ymusic  among others  classical composer and author  nathan thatcher wrote the orchestral charts     away    is a solo project for mr  sheff  but it   s released under the name of the band with a revolving door membership that he founded in      thus  to call it okkervil river   s best album isn   t quite accurate  mr  sheff said he was looking to change his approach to music and songwriting  admitting that on some previous okkervil river recordings he had sought to be clever in pursuit of praise     a kid trying too hard    is how he put it  mr  sheff  who wrote and was enamored with prose and poetry in his younger days   he found the name okkervil river in a short story by  tatyana tolstaya   also acknowledged some of his earlier songs were overstuffed with lyrics which is not to say mr  sheff isn   t adventurous and occasionally dazzling in his wordplay on    away     he sat at his computer and let the words flow in a torrent  but faced a conflict  whether to be more concise or indulge his love of epic storytelling  on    away     he tilts toward the abundant instead of the spare  but the overall effect is engaging and never off putting  there are echoes of early breathless dylan and springsteen in some lyrics  including the opener     okkervil river r i p      in which he documents a litany of miseries he endured before finding a band that revitalizes him  autobiography informs the songs  but the storytelling is rarely linear  as mr  sheff blends reportage and impressionistic imagery to create his tales  many of which suggest he had been fed up with life and career when he began the project     and the cheaper that the music starts to get  it   s like they   re trying to make us cheap along with it     he sings in    the industry     in    frontman in heaven     he sings     i recall when things were way more fun around here       i   m almost a ghost of myself     it gets bleaker in    days spent floating  in the halfbetween         just one day i want to have died       to disappear between two notes in a    tone scale   you can only spend so much time  brother  as the world   s guest    if these downcast words and emotions reflect mr  sheff   s state of mind while writing  the music speaks of a revival  that is  by the time he convened in a studio with the ace musicians  he was ready to move on  beauty is in his response and recovery  and the performances have an ambitious scope that speaks to liberation  somber  fluttery strings introduce    call yourself renee     but the mood changes when a piano and mr  sheff   s voice and acoustic guitar enter  soon   jose galeano   s hand drums give the track a sweet lift  the gorgeous    comes indiana through the smoke    opens with the sound of storms  which is replaced by mr  sheff   s guitar and voice conveying a bittersweet yet hopeful melody made more so by the trumpet of ymusic   s cj camerieri and the warm thump of mr  garabedian   s upright bass   alex sopp   s flute and mr  samuel   s organ enrich the folk number    she would look for me     while mr  galeano   s percussion adds color and energy to the up tempo rocker    judey on a street     the music is meticulously conveyed  instruments occupy their own space without intruding on others  mr  sheff   s fingers can be heard on his guitars    fretboards  he and  jonathan wilson mixed the recording to an airy perfection mr  sheff does cite his grandfather  thurston holmes    bud    moore  a jazz trumpeter who he called    the most important person in my life     by name in    okkervil river r i p        comes indiana through the smoke    was inspired by moore   s service on the battleship indiana during world war ii  ymusic   s mr  camerieri plays moore   s trumpet during the song  yet mr  sheff avoids the maudlin and mawkish through the album  by its end  whatever sadness he harbored has fled  thus     away    emerges as a tribute to change  action and persistence   and the confidence and good taste to challenge oneself with extraordinary musicians  though dark  dour and downbeat at times     away    emerges as a recording so splendid that it is a cause for joy  mr  fusilli is the journal   s rock and pop music critic  email him at jfusilli wsj com and follow him on twitter  wsjrock
