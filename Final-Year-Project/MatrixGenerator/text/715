   co  is undertaking an experiment intended to make high finance more family friendly last year  the new york based investment firm began offering new parents an unusually generous package of benefits  as one of the perks  for instance  the firm pays to fly nannies and infants on business trips during the baby   s first year employees and executives say the policy changes are a welcome start toward making it easier for people at kkr to manage family life with the demands of the private equity business  where extensive travel and workweeks of    plus hours are the norm  but the tensions of being a working parent in finance are far from resolved  the firm acknowledges among the company   s goals  to attract and keep more talented women  who make up     of the firm   s     core investment professionals and about     of its personnel overall  and to encourage more fathers to take meaningful parental leave  kkr says the number of female employees has increased about    since the start of the year at a time when companies like  amazon com inc

 have expanded benefits for new parents  kkr   s offerings are notable  in addition to its flying caregivers  the firm officially recast maternity and paternity leave as gender neutral    parental leave     expanded paid leave for primary caregivers to    weeks and retained coaches to advise employees going on and returning from leave  the firm also pays shipping costs so that mothers can send breast milk home and even offers unlimited coverage for fertility treatments  a spokeswoman says     these are important building blocks  but they are not the be all and end all     says  robert gottlieb  human resources chief at kkr  which has about       employees world wide     the fact is  we still have a distance to go on a lot of things  but we   ve come a great distance from where we were    he   s not aiming to soften the workload  but the firm is starting to explore ways to make jobs more manageable for workers with families  like allowing some employees to work more from home  reallocating staffing on certain projects and developing alternative career paths for those who may not want to pursue the partner track kkr   s driven work environment is    frankly a competitive advantage     says mr  gottlieb     i don   t know if we are looking to be less intense  we can certainly be more flexible  i think we need to wrestle with that more    when his wife wanted to accelerate her career  mr  gottlieb spent two years as a carpool driving  stay at home father after leaving a top human resources position at  goldman sachs
