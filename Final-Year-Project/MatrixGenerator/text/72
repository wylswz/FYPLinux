a year into build a startup mani non technic found team regret not have a technic co founder it s easi to dismiss the idea of get a late technic co founder isn t it too late for that now can t i just hire a senior programm for much le equiti my answer to both question is no it s never too late at kind of ice i hire a develop agenc in croatia to build our mvp i got refer check their plan with advisor and specifi the product a best i could the mvp took twice a long a expect which is t be expect howev the seriou problem start after launch the product didn t scale at all most of the reason whi our mvp didn t scale weren t obviou to me it wasn t just that the app got slower and featur stop work it wa also that ad new featur easili broke old one the code base wa increasingli hard to maintain and iter wa pain slow scalabl isn t just about take one or two high level decis it s about thousand of daili decis that all togeth defin whether a solut can scale and a we know about make decis incent are everyth there s no contract or partnership that can substitut the incent of a technic co founder in retrospect my ego held me back from partner with an experienc technic co founder i overvalu the work i d put into the startup to get it to that point and undervalu the hard work to come in the end i wa abl to find the technic partner that i need here s how i did it a recap of my situat kind of ice wa six month old we d rais a seed round from angel and a micro vc the mvp lay in the hand of an offshor agenc while i wa interview develop to join the team in parallel the agenc had taken on too mani project and our deliveri date kept move backward and recruit new technic talent to our pre launch startup wa harder and slower than i expect money wasn t the issu it hardli ever is but after a hundr develop interview the three candid i made offer to end up at googl it wa start to feel hopeless i hit linkedin and sought out the most senior programm in my network he wa a promin cto base in london i pitch him the project and brought him on board a an advisor spend a few point of equiti for high qualiti advic and access to a larg technic network end up be a realli smart move he put me in touch with a local develop consult that he thought could help me get back on track i know what you re think a consult i wa cautiou of consult becaus they cost a lot of money howev invest in good advic at the begin of a technic project can save x that amount further down the line tweet thi the consult s name wa russ trow he start with a day discoveri sprint to get into the nitti gritti of the develop process architectur and everyth in between russ came out with a thorough assess of the situat and a forward look plan of action the problem were deeper than i d realis the back end architectur wa highli non standard the api wasn t rest didn t support version which ha prove a massiv headach and wasn t built to scale the front end wa a mess of spaghetti code with hundr of xcode error and no clear data model there were mongodb queri all over the place it just got wors russ stay on to help u launch our project i fire the agenc and russ took over the develop we work extrem well togeth russ had all the skill i didn t and i learn someth new everi day russ had never been part of a startup so i share my learn with him too we becam a power team to be honest i never realli consid that he would join a a late co founder until three month in russ wa the partner i d need from the start so in a cafe near liverpool street i ask russ to join a a co founder and we hash out a deal it wa expens but like mani non technic founder with except technic partner i don t regret it for a second whi doe freelanc to hire work so well freelanc de risk the relationship for both parti we have a bia to love our own creation it s call the ikea effect and thi play to the founder s advantag over time isn t it expens to hire a freelanc technic error you make at the earli stage will cost you x more to fix later invest in top talent earli on in your startup is highli leverag how long do you need to work on a freelanc basi befor pop the question like date the answer is differ for everi coupl you should onli ask when there is a veri high chanc of a ye what if thing go wrong after a few week or month it s much cheaper to find thi out with a freelanc than with a bad hire can t i just hire a realli experienc senior programm to my startup you should tri in my experi it a long hard process that carri mani risk i don t have enough money to pay a programm how do i get a technic co founder to work for free if you re ask thi you might be in la la land that s never gon na happen what if the freelanc just want to freelanc here s the thing as an entrepreneur you need awesom sale skill high convict and incred leadership investor want to see you can recruit top technic talent so just do it should all non technic co found team find a technic co founder mayb not but i wouldn t dismiss the idea so fast it realli help me and if you re think about start a tech compani do yourself a favour and don t do it alon about dave bailey i m entrepreneur in resid for down ventur previous i built and
