off the bike  the first thing you notice about peter sagan is the hair the hair is magnificent  it   s chestnut brown with blondish streaks  and it brushes the shoulders of sagan   s rainbow striped jersey  which he wears because he   s the sport of road cycling   s reigning world champion  it is not the hair of a typical bike racer  it is the hair of a man who holds a sword while fighting a tiger   and perhaps a two headed eagle   on the cover of a fantasy paperback it   s mid may  outside san diego  in a day  the tour of california race begins  one week pedaling up the state   s scenic coastline  sagan is the defending champion here  and this morning  a cluster of cyclists wait outside the camper for his team  tinkoff sport  they look like teenagers loitering by a stage door that   s fitting  because sagan is cycling   s rock star  a    year old from slovakia  sagan is a dazzling talent who has already won many races  but wins alone do not fully explain his popularity  it   s the way that sagan wins   through aggressive  old fashioned  almost romantic efforts  meanwhile  he is also something of an eccentric  beloved by cycling fans for his wheelies across the finish line  for breaking tradition and not shaving his legs at the start of this season  he eventually caved and shaved   and his american influenced purchasing habits  sagan recently took delivery on a classic      dodge charger that can blast a foghorn as well as the    dukes of hazzard    theme    peter is a beautiful muscle car     says sagan   s friend  






        scott tedro 


       whose company oversaw the build     he has that raw street power    oh  there   s also the fact that sagan and his wife  katarina  made a shot for shot remake of the last scene of    grease     more on that in a bit the tour de france begins saturday  and the athletically built sagan will not contend for the famed yellow jersey  which is expected to be a battle between featherweight climbers like britain   s chris froome  colombia   s nairo quintana  and sagan   s teammate

       of spain  but sagan is the prohibitive favorite to win the green    points    jersey as the tour   s best sprinter   and throughout the race  he   ll be one of the most watched riders in the field he always is  that crazy bike person at your workplace who can   t stop talking about pro cycling  chances are his or her favorite racer is sagan     if i ever grow up  i want to be like peter sagan     says jens voigt  the cultishly popular german rider who retired from cycling in          he   s the man       i don   t fangirl about people in cycling     says evelyn stevens  the elite american women   s rider newly named to the u s  olympic team     but i do about sagan    here  outside the camper  sagan finally appears  the hair and the rainbow stripes are the easy giveaway  he steps inside the rv  where he takes a seat toward the front  espressos are served in tiny plastic cups    i like it here  california     he says  leaning back and taking a sip     it was always my dream  to come to america    he wants to go surfing while he   s here  of course he does  sagan has a touch of jeff spicoli  the dude like antihero from    fast times at ridgemont high     bike racers are often wired twitchy  jumpy  sagan is chill    i am more easygoing     he says     my hobby is my job  so i can ride  have fun and take some money    he chuckles  sagan is one of the highest paid riders in the sport  at a salary reported to be close to      million annually  and he is beloved by his sponsors    he   s got the charisma  the star quality  the swagger     says slate olson  chief marketing officer at specialized  the morgan hill  calif   company which provides bikes to sagan and tinkoff     the way he competes  it   s just captivating    at the moment  sagan is in the best stretch of his career  last july  he won the tour de france   s green jersey for the fourth consecutive time  then he took worlds  this spring  there were breakthrough victories in a pair of grueling  one day    classic    races  gent wevelgem and the tour of flanders  but again  it   s how sagan wins that becomes the story  everyone knows that cycling has been corroded by doping scandals  none bigger than the one that enveloped the 






        lance armstrong


       era  at the same time  cycling has become a more clinical  data driven sport  riders often know exactly how hard they can ride  for how long  and they can be wary of taking chances and pushing limits outside their numbers  this is not by itself a bad thing   it helps many riders win races  but fans lament the decline of impulsive  flamboyant riding   what french cycling fans call panache   in which riders launch attacks that sometimes work  but often fail spectacularly sagan has panache  he has panache overload consider the world championships  held last september in richmond  virginia  for most of the race  sagan hid in the pack  or    peloton     only in the final lap did he emerge   making a daring move on a short  punchy climb before escaping on a descent and hanging on for a brilliant solo victory   he rode it like he stole it  as the saying goes  it   s the way every rider wants to win a bike race    in an age where everything is calculated and methodical  peter just reacts and shoots from the hip     says christian vande velde  a retired american pro now part of nbc   s tour de france tv team  that   s not a slight on other riders  he says  it merely speaks to sagan   s talent    he   s the most dangerous cyclist in the world     vande velde says sagan   s rise hasn   t been seamless  when big victories did not immediately follow after his signing with tinkoff  he found himself publicly criticized by the team   s steinbrenner like owner  






        oleg tinkov 


       but tinkov says he and sagan haven   t had conflicts for at least a year    peter   s not only winning  he does it in great style     tinkov says diplomatically faded from view is the immature streak of sagan   s earlier years   he was rightly criticized after a      incident in which he pinched a female presenter at a victory ceremony  today  there is less impishness  and more leadership     i   ve been floored by how professional he   s been on and off the bike     says american ted king  a former teammate king has also been a witness to another sagan attribute  his otherworldly bike handling skills  sagan came up as a mountain biker  and can maneuver his lightweight carbon road race bike as if he   s riding raggedy dirt roads  at this year   s paris roubaix race  sagan made audiences gasp when he bunny hopped off the french cobblestones and over rival fabian cancellara   s bike after cancellara went down in a crash king recalls a punishing training ride in italy in which he looked over and sagan was riding uphill  in a wheelie  with no hands    he was basically a circus bear riding a unicycle     king says mountain biking remains one of sagan   s passions  in a bit of a surprise move  he intends to compete in the discipline at the rio olympics in august  passing on the road race     it   s his first sport     says patxi vila  his coach  who is also tinkoff   s sports director     to go off road helps him relax    now about that    grease    reenactment sagan says it started as a private project  before evolving into a promotion for sunroot  a slovakian organic food company  sagan plays danny  john travolta   s character  right down to the letter sweater and the slicked back ducktail hair  katarina plays sandy  complete with the clumsily crushed out cigarette on the ground  together  they launch into a rapturous version of    you   re the one that i want    it is one of the most delightful side projects a pro athlete has ever undertaken  think about it  if steph curry and his wife  ayesha  made a shot for shot remake of    grease     the internet would split in two    it was very nice     sagan says of the video  he swears he did not see    grease    in its entirety until after they made the clip at the end of this season  sagan will be a free agent   oleg tinkov plans to leave the sport and sagan is expected to sign with a new team  on thursday  velonews and the belgian newspaper het nieuwsblad reported sagan would ride next year for bora hansgrohe  a german team  he will be a rock star wherever he goes  when i ask sagan to list his future goals  he smiles    whatever life brings me     sagan says and then he runs a hand through that hair  which is perfect  write to jason gay at jason gay wsj com  awesome article on  a bona fide
