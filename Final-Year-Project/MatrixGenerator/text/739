do into bank shares on friday go on a wild ride what s it all about that sort of talk about next van     is ninety     and was raised     now from our studios in new york     europe i mean yes and stephen dresser     hello everybody poll years studios steven is not with us today we bomb them     so the kid had been now some of our people actually know something about what goes on in the world the markets here     that s not do     it hopefully never hears this     um     so who we are brought in today just a lot of talk about     it you know maybe you for a couple things that the banks this week     wells fargo in the news     on dovish a bank in the news i wanted to talk about those walkabout well s first     on ceo john stumpf backup line on capitol hill getting another severe grilling     to talk about that great all that trouble ahead of projects     we have with us today     on my friends or call him     dave riley apparently cheney     and holmes     you or point     you are on point for our wells fargo life like yesterday     was very impressed with who i was watching the work     is very impressive tell you what about that what we are we are brought impressions of the to the     national hurdle in some ways i aam he was even more intense than the first one i d tammy it was     no longer     commonly around for a long time and and each one of these congressmen     and women wanted to get their licks in     aam and     man there weren t many many calls for     for john stomps resignation     aam you know we we don t know whether the scandal amount and they are how much weight those people who i really and this is the house this time write write write down last week we had the senate     aam and and that was notable for elizabeth warren home really late immune to to john stumpf     aam and calling for his resignation     this time he was on the senate to the dow has a house right the piano and chamber ambition focuses on the democrats  heated and there was a aam both last week and this week there was some     aam bout broad unanimity from both sides the aisle that wells fargo and dom     really messed up over the last few     years but we should call refill our listeners and right when it is executive netease     eric berry this is a dominant     in one thing that struck me though is and me just from people is     in the lake is a was really intense its eight who is really long     but they didn t feel like it had the same     fever pitch around it is the senate hearing did this sort of fell like wheat hurl this before says rogue urgent aiding in the bed there was this said hey where s the first time in the most intense questioning seem to happen     yet amid the might be it may be the tool since we heard it once before that i m human i might be a little     less     shocked by     the intensity of a grilling the second time around well we should note that they didn t invent we came we heard a new verb yesterday     if you remember that left the chair of the house     committee chairman jed had its own ring     i came up with a one per he told john stumpf     ie know you ve been warren already so i m not owing to warren you get the refill isn t it opens and the list to deter that fails or is iran he was referring there to senator elizabeth warren in the democrat from massachusetts     who completely fully     johns them the week the phantom of credit i m wrong but said he should be in jail is not how shy and i think she said that he should resign give back every cent either earned and     the that and as they get to the investment criminally the future is yet just     can not live in jail the the stuff     he did finally call yesterday said the ecb in jail so     you know pretty much a mean you have a lot of political theater the house and yes did the backing of for for around busters you haven t heard much about this     the reason john stumpf is being repeatedly brought to washington for the public     found     she means is that his bank that the     millions of unwanted accounts to customers without their knowledge so     that may lead to generate more cross selling products and some fees     on     a big no no though and and stuff has been instead of cereal apology note for the last two or three weeks      flow in and then this isn t for you to that before i mean one thing that is different also this week from the senate hearing was when     joseph went to the senate hearing     he said i m sorry i m accountable for this     but you really have much concrete to give the senators     and it didn t really own and i mean     he said that all up but he also in the first year and a lot more of     all this bad stuff you ve heard about     that s not really us it s just one percent of the people     are called tourists fly     we had some bad apples     that hole     stan was pretty much flushed out any may have more ammunition to any anyone know why it didn t use that to two days before the hearing     the board came and said they were clawing back forty one million dollars of his compensation     say he was able this time the villain saying a lot     this is affected me     and     i you know i mean i guess its ceo     scrum people joke that a     it s nice to be in a position where someone didn t take forty one million dollars of the compensation you still love you plenty left over     but i think in in anyone s book forty one minute million dollars a big number and abandoned     one was for one was a big number especially before in the banking industry i know we will impose further saying     he you ve never really seen this in the banking industry have to     look at other nations to call backs of this size     so that that     the question then becomes     is this an outlier is this a one off or to do is     you know     that that cold sure of the banking industry for changing where     high executives are held more directly responsible for what happened to many yet that s a really good question in what we saw the board do with its claw back the stems forty one million dollars in stock awards     and comments from from a different executive of ninety nine dollars     this would stop it was sort of an     attempt to     have more job security most the time the c club as it after the fact that after some of the dryer death today resigned     the whole idea of a club that money became     pretty popular with regulators to bank executives after the crisis was yet all these traders and executives who made     millions tens of millions of dollars in two thousand five two thousandsix     and maybe one on to something else they retired they went to the beach     and then     only later did we find out that everything they did in two thousandsix two thousandseven     turned out to be a disaster     and loss them and lots of money soak in situations like that the bank said he ll be nice if we can go back     and not just the people     the dpi tax and then walk away but see how things play out over three or four years and if it turns out really bad what comes out that broke the law or did something fraudulent wheat go back and get some of that money that we keep them     so we have is this the best of securing     his face that the well and stop in sims position he has left the bank he still there and one of the ba that criticism to stop was that he threw fifty three hundred mid level and lower level employees under the bus     wells fargo fired five thousand employees for this conduct over half a decade     but stumpf didn t suffer all and and so in the first year in the senate and the elizabeth warren another senators     they said how come you don t have any skin in the game wired she s suffering because of this can be a terrible situation     aam use you still have all your money so that your job and said     five or six days later     the board with stomps approval     and said     well maybe should have allah on     and that that s not under the radar by the way that day i think a degree in medicine twice tenure in my dissent was ten years he that was his recommendation to the board that     they they call back that money     yet and i think the reasons that are doing it is because he wants to hold on to ws to show some accountability he s     he s     feeling the pain about everyone else out in the organization and the customers and so on     you know were to say a bow i you know what what is wells is been with the speeding in this situation everyone agrees it was a terrible thing hmm what does it say on how to     do this for wider environment that these things are operating in the mean     you know     when when when     prompted to say you know amusing airports times are tough for banks is is deathly a relative term but i mean     these guys are all kinds of clawing and scratching to get businesses to find ways to generate profits and     i think     not to excuse but they did that some of this i think is driven by that     with the wrong way what is this say about this or a wider environment that these banks are operating     but think you re right it s a it s a tough environment for banks and is a lot of pressure     to     get what revenue take and where they can     begin to give the setback pulled it from that because actually the truth is with the activity that when on wells fargo and that the bank is set this     didn t really make money off of this     um you know opening a checking account for someone     and then ben has no money in the inning closing at three months later she loses the bank money     to it he was more     i think with this there was     a philosophy that we want to cross sell products can one be deeper in our customers lots which makes perfect sense it may     be a bit but think     cross owns demo little bit unfairly tarnished europe     gillis supper yet we all go to supermarkets     to markets that are the epitome of cross selling here you we use them a butcher a baker candlestick maker     now we just go to costco     so that that was served they were trendy something similar here     but this sales culture it that rule realm that someone again i am not not so much that this help the corporate bottom line because a lot of individuals doing what they did the thinking was all wrong when he will help the corporate bottom line     is the more you what they don t want is you all you have a checking account with us     but didn t say you wells fargo but then you go take a more true bankamerica to relate well right when we should you know we should we can avoid all that so why don t we     so it just did     did did the whole sales goals     the incentives that were built in     seem to have the rail line and off the rails part was the side effect unwanted side effect it did make them a lot of money but this seemed push the same impressive drive that that that     that allergan and personal bankers to give you an extra pot to really really work hard to get into that fifth or sixth product to really want to get your mortgage your extra credit card at wells fargo and not from     some company that sent you the rewards program in the mail     all that that hard drive enclosure is what made them so successful     the unwanted side effect of that was that their employees were so wired to get more products in the door     but the one that that a one off the rails into transition and on my p i it s funny     riley mention the     the lady of cross selling being kylie to the supermarket grocery store i mean     wasn t that the degree promised banking model in the nineteen nineties that     will open two thousand and eight     when i finaly and the bank s be your one stop shopping there i think you re thinking of your conflating will that they re using them to the model the late nineteen nineties the universal bank     and that was more corporate basis where a bank would do     you know corporate banking you would you invest in paying it would do insurance that was all these things are     crosses so that that s not     on you know with     the banks were put together in the late nineteen eighties     for selling to the likes of you and me     that was for alike servicing ibm angie s of the world so i think that this is different this is like a sad to say you ve got to check in cap     let s see you know     go ahead and try to get to take your mortgage at with us that as of yet this is a mainstream issue this is something that could take place in any regional bank in east any smaller break even community bank at the same issues and that s why some of the senators and congressmen this week said     to the regulators who you should be looking at are all the banks while and with a reference to the tune of do it for approval what what     what are the next steps after all it s one big thing that happened this week that flew under the radar was that that stamp set for the first time he got a call from warm buffett which is the the the largest shareholder and wells fargo is been a very supportive shareholder in the bank     for a long long time     and let s dump said     was that buffett told him     down     so buffett said     leader     on     that on cnbc that that that he told stomp this is a bigger deal then then it seems you think it s now that s that s pretty telling and it shows that the fed is very concerned about this     and so the question about the next step is to what is up to do it the shares can stomp     get his investors to to come down and and sort of     take a breath can you give customers and regulators and politicians come down     and move to the next step or will ever acquire new leadership that the bank for that to happen     in the other big question as we all knew this going on congressional investigations state investigations federal investigations     as walls investigations by the u s attorney s offices in three states     so this is insert like ok they ve done the hearing is that s the end of the story     it might not be is apparent in the public sense can unite and having series going on     of but this is going to run for quite a bit more in the board itself is no hard and in in law firm     to do an independent a seat on the boards behalf so both inside the tummy about so the company     there s still a lot happening     ard     let s leave it there and you gentlemen i m sure will be covering it     below you will because of

wells fargo a few minutes their analysis which in two years while we it that is all we had to post about     myself     at which a b riley in our home here in the studio in new york     and on the phone from one game that we have our good friend james mackintosh     who has been falling everything going on it to a train james hell are you     evidence that it bought from the     and possible inclusion of the european banking system     are worth a full hilton     but see how passionate about the first of what i let let s turkey let s start with this point     to zero to combat this change so zoe s talk about     this one point     popular prime it this     is what     is happening at deutsche bank right now     analogous to what happened at lehman brothers in two thousand and eight or isn t it and and were that the difference is     what i mean did a symbol of cseries yes and no     man as a way to socialism     and the ana it i think it s fair to say that seems to fascinate pretty much anything happens happens people upset on our kids you re putting them and     and     an indication to which it s probably a bit more similar than most of the things that have been highlighted but     it isn t a perfect analogy from a stone with with the analogy does work which is that     all one to hedge funds     i m     being     a calling at least some of that money     to torture     um and so some people start to get wa read about deutsche whose     creditworthiness     i m ands     a peace treaty that any bank can have the run on the back     sit in the nature of banking and     it was hedge funds that what one of the bank     group s to pull money out the demon     and costs     the trick is that apple     was to squash it with a trip to the dance when     i m alone with that so it s going to impact on tuesday     read     financings     we ve to which     that s kind of where they where the analogy to games that makes people think of this is this just in     the beginning of the wrong     time     that s also where the analogy and because this color differences     onto each day is much much less reliant on these guys to prove only to the day to day liquidity     it takes to financing but meaningless side of     the mill was entirely wholesale clients     was that it was an     assumption of buying the wrong shoes     um     which is the best known for its bake     investment banking operations muscle to wear a lot of problems     it also has a very large retail operation in germany     um     so profitable sealed the so the thing you with one topic eurobank     body does provide it with little formal old takes take action     and     i mean a litany of inducements run that but it s it s very hard to imagine     new listings were     all all what s the     merits of jesus is there     the new york     it on today while krishna head about it was his euro to the man     i m always had trends for work getting out down and after lehman many more hedge funds were were getting out of their     prime brokerage because they were concerned about them the first line under     the hedge funds are getting out of deutsche in now and in europe you testified tuesday that a separate and risk management for     the listed all the sense that ditching has in its favor pay retail presence at investment bank and sought     these hedge funds overreacting or is this this is a smart move to make from a     prudent fiduciary standard     most are just ones that i didn t mention there s the deutsche tussles     today won t be stuck in jinan culture pulte reported at two hundred and twenty billion euros in     equity     which is kind of cash and     things that can be a was to me to the tune in to catch     that existing homes or can t deal with the weak ones who will sit     lots of cash before it gets you into trouble     aam     but anyway that s that s that s a bit more difficult to     should you pull art quilt     we find the reason is that vulnerable to rock this is that     you care if you re a cost of money you get to read very little in the way wolf     it s good stuff from you by     the zowee s enough of my you could cut into the would be pretty much the same     crops     i m you know you might have some warm feelings about the     people you deal with it may be inconvenient to me     q tell me you     end up buying a box that i m so it s massive     for cp stick with them and they stay in business the upstarts     or even if you can get all full     so i do     well two thousandeight     and leader of the men told     which comes     out was that it s much better just to jump ship for stalling in trouble     coal stocks helped went so would use to be the retell     it took years to     about the nineteenth century use to get runs fairly open a box because the same uptick applies to your savings     it was not made it this is the stadium is your stuff come soulful flow and a method to but i guess when that when the big things in you touched on the school that is that you know the analogy isn t perfect here and then the biggest reason of course     is that with lehman brothers was just liquidity questions solves the question     is is that assets of the books more and more to what the firm said they were in the ward ever to be worth that     which torture the question seems to center around a much more immediate question     which is up for the fec huge bill from the justice department for a legal settlements     and that blows the whole their capital     but now it seems today like people are filled with better about that     to put it mildly i mean     citi shares today     was a     kid having people off the share price chart you haven t read the share price chopper don t look edition of prussia just     joko what they     say the shares today in europe after the crash fully what happened tonight in the u s market     shares opened down rustic and horrible     the rule was saying is camille police henchmen to put new money is the end of the well that the mentally over again     may we had a bit more positive stuff when it s a reassuring voice to restore reassuring words from this the job crime     i which which suited     the hopes that bitcoin chewy center that opened up a copy for sale maybe it s not quite as apocalyptic as you think     and in this report comes out from the afp     news was that this     time     and in all the missiles they say which this     and that     is a discussion with the it department justice about tackling the small beach claim time     the five point four billion dollars and that number but that had been home a table full report it to     apply the will street gentle couple weeks ago it     was that it was a fourteen billion dollars     so some very big difference in price     and the shares from them new today now up eighteen percent was to complement its guides people we we     got some according     to statistic     peta people all realy trick unhappy     this is on a short covering     nonsense text or by means is that no excitement in the global     multi national bank     to remember is in a nice to me back when you can click to read this is this is because to go to keep in mind it s not so gigantic in terms of market value     the deutsche bank s market valued even effort about today s game is only about sixteen billion your it s pure torture but to the point there this is their call on     them the tothe the point they re about it being called germany thank you also touched on that just a little bit in your column     about the difference between what the fed     he didn t do with meaning     and what might happen or what what resources might be available to deutsche bank s it just touched on that     yet so this again is made in addition to the tune of twenty billion or so to catch on     and i think that they can actually be any cuter clients don t leave him     they will say that because there are of the relaunched by quickly     public connection to the central bank     they effectively can use a central line support broken to turn that offer access to catch     night you you might get a pop down and told you watch it     in     the week if you ve paid consultants     it doesn t scratch     i m silly chicken to the tweens old its holdings of homes with     adults of all the stuff that the colts and a human emissions it can do that with some stuff that     normally this     wouldn t accept     that s     probably hundreds     of billions maybe even more open to him i into     the super easy catch it can get     the dimensions he     said     the idea that     you don t even hedge funds pulling     billions of dollars     bc and the what opel be exaggerated torture that could last for very long time     no this is to say that include the two which overstated its profits which i ll     actually     keep the recalls of problems     and it s the two     i m in it maybe was just stepping back a bit last     week to which     i wish that differently     to     go back to two thousand and eight     the team and it was becoming clear out some very very serious     she investments     old one cheap money and property stocks which     ever one to realize what what     what they felt it was     just too cool to know right where it lost     more than ten percent     shareholder     equity in the states     one     one other thing that s really important     in coach s favor right now is the macro berman is much better that i would argue that it was into thousandeight when when the man was going under     i aam     u s government a gesture to engineer to rescue bear stearns     and while the german government is in no time     no not at all eager to bail out deutsche bank     and     other financial institutions are more healthy now than they were into thousandeight     and that would help is going to try to sell its large     asset management unit was to try get a decent price tag and help up their capital if they needed to do it     and the german government said you gotta do something or not to bail you out that they could do that     by comparison into thousandeight     no one was buying anything healthy assets somewhat healthy assets because the run was just freaked out this here     and there are a bunch of other firms that were larger than the mnemonic while newland maryland wabco via     the ign morgan stanley the world teetering unknown was doing anything so     the macro environment much better     to do which are probably even if their old house is not doing very well in their own profitability outlook is is negative     they re a lot of other things that that can help them you know     that the reason that     brings up a fama maya so they ll wanna talk about     okay so     even a fourteen billion dollars judgment from justice department a big number that is not a small number sonic and significant number     but from everything you re telling me about it seems like     they should be able to whether even a number that     the one way or another why then is it is so much peter     and i m wondering and james on italian provinces to know if     i d be used is about more than just deutsche bank will lead to all emerging in angus is is something i think it s overlooked is that     they can weather fourteen billion dollar number     they didn t then they can t because the simple fact is that the bank needs capital     function and to which it doesn t have enough capital     it s been under capitalists in over a leverage for a number of years     so at it like this     would just be with shoot in the capital buffer the regulators would have to act and the data point true i know i think it is james take a look at what their capital levels does not know what the regulatory capital is what investors are looking at today     the new look and then they have the lowest actual tangible like a ratios     of any large institution the world s     good and it s really know what investors are willing     to to finance get siesta does not the same as saying that they would be     seen as a human type situation it was a fourteen billion dollars     well if you don t have sufficient capital to meet the rate of foreign minimums investors oliveira newedge s indoor to lehman situation no cuz they would still be johnny on the mortgages tell me that s     the area     they would still need to know whether a fourteen billion dollars bid that s earlier in the doj really see an outcome where it finds that a big fourteen billion dollars in the files for bankruptcy the next is that that really wanna do well that s that s like email me in reality probably     the ecb to fourteen billion to hear what you can take it to the point where he compensable homes that exceeded the contingent that opel concur s whitby trickett     said it it s a variable the daily     news limited     then it switches to fix this would trust their equity clsa s kushner a critique     that before they would have to raise new capital     but no the same thing is     going on today regulate remain oems and bny however is the result that solutions     because that because they still haven t     gotten was going to give the capital     well if you destroy you ll     existing you try to existing shareholders and look to benefit the new shareholders to me this is a risky rights issues were     wanna     know where to buy in at this level that for the market selling     well look i just the crust i really wanted to get at whether or not diligent think and can withstand a fourteen billion fire whatever the fine is um whatever the situation is     what     is this all one bank situation or is this a wider situation could you look at     everything that s happened in the financial sector here in europe     i know this to a european banks is he s been questionable for years     your scene all a lot of the year around more than just going to back to my question is why is that happening     is that nearly an overreaction to leave scores from awaken haven t healed or is there something really be concerned about     visit the     in in euro     and tend to a lesser extent in the u s and europe is a     twofold problem which is to say     what three toll pro rated they haven t dealt with external these big hangovers of pre crisis problems on its fourteen million pounds to the plane from the tea and chat     i m     that s this in the media it s the instant problem to go     to a really long running profitability problem     he s going to happen it just it just too many banks to many bankers     and not enough     parking revenue to go right and     and that s a very painful thing to chips to the state doing that with the lame people all     it takes a long time to choose their profits     kohl s     charge the profits it makes it much harder to
