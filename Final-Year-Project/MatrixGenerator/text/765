the first is that if the nhl did that and how that affects the lights spots important because a lot of firms in the industry are getting taken over     um and some of them over the influential ones the money     is an important firm and supplier for a lot of people they report by fidelity     back then which is one of the bigger     companies in the industry being purchased by ss and say     overall i am     sorry northstar which is the parent company of orion gemini gemini fund services     and cls being purchased by tna associates     and     you also had investment     purchase upside which is a robo advisor     so this question in the minds of advisors     what does all this mean     well on the positive side     is more money coming into the industry     which means there will be more funding for development     and hiring new people for doing more rapid development     on the other side i think this if you re on the part of some advisors     that they could be a negative as well when you have these outsiders coming and     you know will they have a positive or negative influence     on the direction of future development     i think it s still an open question     but so far it appears to me the most of the purchases of them strategic ones     an all indications are least in the short to medium term     that is more positive sign negatives     and using off the lot that day international roboadvisors cost more about that granted my advisors to watch     well i think um robo advisers have been sort of a new phenomenon     has really shaken up the industry     if you talk to advise is as recently as mine months ago     they would tell you they were really worried about it     but i think the direction of the conversation changed recently     on     almost every advisor i d talk to is certainly aware of robo advisors     and at least on trying to figure out if they need to respond and if so how     to me are a sort of what i think of our roboadvisors i think about him     into separate ways one is the business model on the other is that technology     so a lot of the early criticisms of robo advisors work adds more to do with the business model     i don t really concern was also much with that i concern myself with more with that knowledge     it seems to me that technology is a positive     you know there were you better technologies coming     that now advisors can take advantage of this wall     so that s a positive     state of killing her advisors is to walk down to business in some way or adopt a part of the world will advise you as     well i think it forces me to think about the business model and rethink it and say     you know     is is it ok to have a business as usual what do i need to change to respond to new trends     in the industry a new demographics     once you understand are you trying to serve     then you can find the appropriate technology to serve     whatever the demographic in going after is     certainly if you re trying to deal with millennials i think     you need newer technology     um     but i would argue that     everybody     you know across all demographics     are more tech savvy today     they want twenty four seven service     on and they want the common experience that the robo advisers offer     so i think advice is to meet up with technology     technology is so important and on that note cybersecurity czar for the non     alot advisors mines regulators lines as well so what s one takeaway for advisors     in all the cybersecurity     act are looking needed to protect itself about a     boy think it s very difficult to give specific advice to a general audience but cybersecurity because everybody s     situation is somewhat different     but i think the main thing that advisors need to know is a there s going to be a lot more scrutiny going forward     the cyber crooks are getting more sophisticated     and you need to do something     so you know the scc lifted right that some guidelines which are a good place to start     and i think if you re a smaller advisor in particular     and you don t have the in house expertise     you need to be the reliable suppliers will find     an outside third party expert     they can bite you     on when you re dealing with your bigger firms     i think they have     the expertise     and i think also revealed them to some extent     they rely on the expertise of their custodians in their own suppliers     to make sure that things are     being done properly but they have to do would     have some due diligence process to make sure     that they re checking all the boxes and the snow was gone     is it also using the cloud isn t worth it     well certainly the cloud is important if you have     a server in your office     i don t think most advisors know whether that s a receipt or not     if you re going with the reliable respected third party     cloud provider     they have full find people that are protecting     that server making sure the     proper security is in place     so in my opinion     the cloud for most advisors is a much more secure way to go     to the line going on     in house
