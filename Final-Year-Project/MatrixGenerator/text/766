articles national museum of african american history and culture review power with a light architectural touch            washington dark and blocky from a distance but dissolving into filigree screens of gleaming bronze poised upon a base of transparent glass  the new national museum of african american history and culture bears the immense weight of its historic genesis   over a century in the making   as lightly as the shimmer on its triple stacked crown shape  the   th museum to be built on the national mall in washington  the nmaahc is large but not monumental  companionable in its rectilinear form to its beaux arts neighbors but radical in its transparency and refusal to look  and even feel  like other museums  with city wide celebrations to mark its opening on sept      the nmaahc appears not grandiose but generous the         square foot structure   s three part crown shape   the    corona      was inspired by a sculpture of a yoruba king from west africa  the culture considered the proverbial roots of the majority of african americans  it was a felicitous choice by an all black architectural design team    phil freelon of perkins   will  london based  david adjaye  and the late  j  max bond jr  of  davis brody bond of new york  plus the locally experienced firm smithgroup    who understood that the design would not resonate if it were derived from classical and other western motifs  the red sandstone of the crenelated smithsonian castle        across the mall  after all  was quarried by slaves  other newish museums on the mall have tried to distinguish themselves from the dart and egg corniced limestone monuments of the past by stripping them of ornament  as  i m  pei did at the east wing        of the national gallery of art  throwing a curve  as the hirshhorn museum        did with its doughnut shape  or simply making them like glass and steel corporate headquarters  as at the national air and space museum         the national museum of the american indian        opted for the extreme regionalism of a geological outcropping in the southwest with wetland landscaping  the nmaahc approaches permanence with a lighter touch  the      million museum is sited on a cutout of land left over at the western most end of the mall between the national museum of american history and the lawn of the washington monument  irregularly shaped and considered the last buildable lot on the mall  the exposed site made the usual frontal positioning of a major museum more complicated  it did afford the architects an opportunity to place the building so it looks in multiple directions  toward museums as well as the monuments around the tidal basin  the white house and the city the    foot structure looks simple enough  a screen of bronze coated aluminum panels   in three layers like stacked in boxes   is suspended from the roof like a lampshade and wrapped around a glass box   each panel is tilted outward at      degrees to rhyme precisely with the angle of the washington monument   s own crown   but there were considerable structural challenges  from the obvious desire to keep interior spaces wide open and free of view blocking columns to the serious task of burying more than half of the    level building underground to meet height and program requirements the foundation rises not from bedrock but marshland   the city is famously a swamp   calling for a bathtub structure much like the one from the world trade center site now memorialized at the national september    memorial   museum in new york  the rough coated concrete retaining wall  here     feet long and     feet tall  is a potent architectural moment  the sheer physical power of the wall underscored by words about freedom from the abolitionist  absalom jones  negro spirituals and the declaration of independence carved across the slate dark surface  the history galleries are chockablock with artifacts  from the grimmest testaments to inhumanity and the struggle to rectify that past to contemporary  interactive storytelling videos  they fill more than three levels within a single space served by a continuous switchback ramp threading together a narrative that flows like an unstoppable river fed by multiple story  and time lines  culture and community galleries are housed on the upper floors even before the directional signage was installed  the space embodied clarity and accessibility  the overall plan is straightforward  with the above grade exhibition floors stacked so that interior balconies afford plenty of room to step away for a breather  windows  though few  are carefully placed to frame specific inspiring views of monuments around the tidal basin and beyond  a luxuriantly coiling  black corten steel staircase  best viewed from an entry bridge across a moat on the north facing side of the building  leads down to the history galleries and the  oprah winfrey theater  an interior waterfall aims to be the museum   s most serenely uplifting design element  on the exterior  it rises into a large circular well and light oculus on the north plaza  inside  it is a place apart  entered from the top of the ramp  a small bench lined room contains a circle of water falling free from the well above  separated from everything by mesh and glass walls  it is intended as a place to think about  possibly recover from seeing  the emotionally charged objects on display  making room for people is clearly a goal that the museum wants to achieve  some       people a day   three million a year   are expected to visit  the lobby is not going to be filled with objects  gatherings and events apparently take precedence  but nothing delivers that message of empowering and welcoming more clearly than the sculpturally muscular and gracefully sweeping concrete awning that stretches the entire length of the south fa  ade  creating what must be the largest porch in the city  beneath it a long stone bench with a reflecting pool fountain cooling the air invites all comers to relax in the shade  surely a smithsonian first  architecture often deals in grand statements rather than subtle emotions  but at the national museum of african american history and culture  the spirit of inclusion  celebration and even spiritual uplift is palpable in every space  ms  iovine writes about architecture for the journal
