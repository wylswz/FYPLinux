articles mark rothkos son remembers his father            this month  the museum of fine arts  houston presents mark rothko  a retrospective   the first comprehensive exhibition of the abstract expressionist   s work in the united states since       drawing primarily from the landmark rothko collection owned by the national gallery of art in washington  d c   the show  which runs through january  features more than    pieces spanning the artist   s career  most in rothko   s personal possession at the time of his death in         only   years old when his father died  christopher rothko   the artist   s youngest child and only son   now oversees the rothko family collections  as one of the people most familiar with the prolific painter   s body of work  he reflects on his father   s colorful life and history with houston   the choice for me to dedicate my life to my father   s work was an easy one  his paintings have always spoken to me  and i find it very rewarding that i can make an active contribution to his exhibitions  my father had me pretty late in his life  at nearly     so i got a dad and a grandfather  he was always warm and affectionate  and the thing i remember most about him is his voice  it was round and warm  he used to sing a lot  and he had one main musical interest  mozart  so he was usually humming an instrumental tune  as a child  i remember going to his studio on east   th street in new york when he was working on the murals for the rothko chapel in houston  he would unravel this    foot roll of paper for me to paint on  he didn   t tell me what to make  never gave any instructions  just encouraged me to go for it  he was always interested in unbridled expression this retrospective  at the museum of fine arts  houston  is long overdue since houston was actually one of the first cities to host a major solo rothko exhibition  in       it will show my father   s work from the      s       s   all the way through the end of his career  it   s an amazing collection in terms of works on paper and  of course  fabulous paintings  i get to see the full scope of his collection all the time  but most people don   t  so this show is going to completely change their understanding of rothko and give them a much fuller picture of his career  these are also works that were still in my father   s personal collection when he died  so they have that special flavor of something that he consciously held onto  my father was essentially self taught  he went to yale for two years and dropped out having never taken an art class  a year or so later in new york  a friend invited him to come to a drawing class with him  and i believe he instantly fell in love  he spent roughly    years as a figurative painter  abstract and very experimental  around       he took a year off to study philosophy  and he also had a strong interest in mythology  in the early      s he returned to painting  and by      he was working as a surrealist  or neo surrealist  inspired by all the artists of that genre  his artwork became overtly mythic for a couple of years and kept becoming increasingly abstract  rothko then got rid of titles and sometime in      moved away from figures altogether  and what is called his multiform period was born   very colorful paintings  as colorful as the hallmarks of the      s  and what he   d become very well known for  these were just amorphous patches of color that fill the whole canvas  with no frame  no title  then  in a matter of four years of honing and simplifying his form  eventually  in       he started painting what the world thinks of as rothkos  his signature style of rectangles that are bright  saturated and warm with different layers of colors that are thinned out and built up to create a rich surface color  basically  my father fully found his voice the      s  by which time he was a well known artist  is also the period he   s most misunderstood  he turned down the volume and started darkening his color palettes  making things that seep in over time  i think he had concerns that in the      s people took his paintings as being simply joyous  or perhaps decorative  and he didn   t want them to be either of those  joy isn   t out of bounds  but it   s always tempered with memories of all the hard things you had to go through to get to the ecstasy  for him  those two pulls   the ecstasy and the doom   were always mixed  and they enhanced each other  i think he felt on some level that with the brighter  lighter colors people were missing that point  so the work in the      s does not reach out and grab you  but the paintings make you stop  and once you stop  they become a world in itself and hold you because they take up your whole point of vision  there is just a depth that you sink into  and they will take you places further than the      s paintings  but you have to put in the time  you have to slow down  and you have to really think about what   s important as opposed to simply what   s immediately pleasing  those paintings are powerful because they have that interplay of darkness and light that i think makes the interaction between the ecstasy and doom palpable 
   anyone who comes to this exhibition will see rothko at his most intimate    
my father   s works became simpler and simpler because he found a more direct way to say what he had to say  and yet many people  almost    years on  still find his works perplexing  the reason they   re confused is that he only paints half the picture in a sense  you have to bring the rest to make the meaning of it specific for you  it will be about some element of what he calls the human drama or the human condition  he   s provided his  and now you have to provide yours  for his part   and i will emphasize that he was not interested in self expression  just expressing his understanding of the world   my father had a lot of formative experiences  people forget  but he was desperately poor for most of his life  lost his father at age     experienced the great depression  came from an eastern european jewish background and left russia before the revolution  he was always concerned about the plight of people  it was always in his consciousness rothko   s paintings are fragile  if they   re not carefully displayed and lit  they just become a bunch of rectangles on a wall  it   s my job to try to make sure that people understand my father   s work as best as possible and really appreciate it  if i   m doing that  i feel pretty good about things  people who know and love his paintings know that if they   re well displayed you can have an experience   a very deep and gratifying one      as told to sade strehlke
