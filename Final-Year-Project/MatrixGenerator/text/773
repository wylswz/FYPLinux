articles watteaus soldiers scenes of military life in eighteenth century france review            new york the military seems an improbable subject for  jean antoine watteau              a painter known for his f  tes galantes   idyllic scenes of aristocratic lovers in verdant settings   and his wistful commedia dell   arte actors  yet  between      and       at the beginning of his short career  he produced about a dozen canvases of soldiers  highly admired at the time  they were acquired by important collectors  frequently copied  and widely circulated as prints  in       one of these paintings entered the frick collection     the portal of valenciennes     c            a group of soldiers against massive architecture  bathed in watteau   s characteristic golden  autumnal light  it is now the centerpiece of a fascinating exhibition     watteau   s soldiers  scenes of military life in eighteenth century france     organized by aaron wile  the museum   s current  anne l  poulet curatorial fellow   watteau   s soldiers  scenes of military life in eighteenth century france    the frick collection   through oct     if we spend even a short time in this small  sharply focused exhibit  we quickly realize that the military is not as unlikely a subject as we had thought for the painter of elegant  amorous couples and melancholy performers  instead of battle scenes  glorifications of heroism  and triumphant generals  we are presented with small  intimate visions of ordinary soldiers in private moments  resting  removed from action and violence  victory or defeat  they sit or lie upon the ground  lean on walls  chat  gaze at the women who followed the regiments  or simply withdraw into themselves  mr  wile   s excellent catalog essay notes that watteau   s peaceful images of soldiers were made during the brutal war of the spanish succession               france   s horribly destructive  albeit ultimately successful effort to place a grandson of louis xiv on the spanish throne  as a native of valenciennes  a city close to the site of a notably bloody battle  watteau had firsthand experience of the grim realities of   th century warfare  as well as of soldiers filling in time between engagements  yet those realities never enter his work  only in the earliest of the paintings on view     the line of march     c         in which a column of soldiers  those closest to us on horseback  surges into fictive depths  is there a distant suggestion of the smoke of battle  in a possible companion piece     the halt     c          a surprising composition dramatically bisected by a spreading tree   a bandaged soldier anchors the right  largely male  side of the canvas  yet his injuries do not prevent him from seeming to gaze at a standing woman in yellow on the left  another woman faces her  while a third  seated front and center  stares us down  the implications of these exchanges dominate the picture  not the seated soldier   s sling and bound head  with their echoes of struggle  injury and pain four of watteau   s surviving military paintings are included   three others are in russian museums  which refuse to lend to american exhibitions  while another four are now known only from prints   that watteau did not entirely invent his detached view of warfare is attested to by the tranquil    the cavalry camp               by the flemish painter  philips wouwerman   an immensely popular artist in the   th century   while watteau   s influence is signaled by a derivative scene by his follower  nicolas lancret  these inclusions help to underscore the distinctive quality of watteau   s military scenes  but it is the exhibition   s lively drawings that announce his originality most clearly  a wealth of vigorous  acutely observed images of soldiers seemingly captured unawares  between encounters   stretched out full length or seated  manipulating their guns or casually standing  doing nothing in particular watteau apparently drew constantly  with urgent strokes of red or black chalk that conjure up gestures  postures  and details of clothing with minimal means  unlike the majority of his colleagues  he didn   t draw from the figure in order to populate preconceived compositions  rather  he sketched from casual observation or  in the studio  posed his models to evoke the inconsequential moments he had observed on the spot  recording everything from how a soldier   s cloak drapes over a long barreled gun and how a drummer handles his unwieldy instrument to how bored  exhausted men lie on the ground  the exhibition and its catalog make clear how watteau used these rapid  spontaneous images  and some equally vital drawings of women  as a kit of parts from which to construct his compositions  combining figures from different sheets into new relationships  the result is a slight dislocation among the figure groups  often  gazes do not quite meet  while the connection between individuals is somewhat off kilter  this lends the paintings a faint  invigorating overtone of strangeness  immensely appealing to modern viewers   something similar happens  probably for similar reasons  in the paintings of groups of peasants by watteau   s   th century predecessors  the le nain brothers  whose work he must have known  the frick has a history of presenting small  informative  impeccably chosen exhibitions that illuminate selected works in the museum   s collection     watteau   s soldiers    does just that  ms  wilkin is an independent curator and critic
