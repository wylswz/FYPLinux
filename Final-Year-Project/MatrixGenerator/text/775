articles body of devotion the cosmic buddha in  d review            washington while the smithsonian   s freer gallery of art is undergoing renovations  curator of ancient chinese art keith wilson has moved a five foot tall      pound stone figure to the sackler next door  it is the centerpiece of    body of devotion  the cosmic buddha in  d     a show about the ways digital technologies can help unlock centuries old secrets    body of devotion  the cosmic buddha in  d    arthur m  sackler gallery   through dec        the statue   s head and hands are missing and its pose is static  but from neckline to hem its robe teems with vignettes  carved in relief  these variously feature flying angels and seated buddhas  gatherings of haloed figures  pavilions and palaces  horsemen a galloping  or men burning at the stake and being speared by horned creatures  the reliefs are not  however  always easy to see  their carving is shallow  their figures small  their compositions complex  and the stone itself is textured  further confusing the eye and making it difficult to tell where scenes begin and end  it is often easier to decipher the action by looking at the two nearby ink rubbings made sometime before the freer acquired the statue in       the paper was pressed against the stone and the raised areas inked  recasting the carved images into stark black and white outlines  these were the kind of rubbings that angela howard  professor emerita of rutgers university  mainly relied on in the early     s when she tackled the first in depth study of this sculpture  examining style and content  she dated the sculpture to the sixth century and  correlating its reliefs with buddhist scriptures  determined that those on the front depict buddhist cosmology  from hell realms to the heavens  that divine gatherings mostly fill the back  and that the sides feature stories of shakyamuni  the man who established buddhism  as well as tales from his previous lives  at the time  scholars knew of no comparable sculptures  and ms  howard called this one the    cosmological buddha    since then  two developments have proved huge boons  in       workers in northern china stumbled on a cache of buried statuary from the fifth and sixth centuries in qingzhou  this yielded two works with reliefs similar to those of the freer   s buddha  and the confirmation that statues were typically painted  more recently  digital imaging has become an ever more sophisticated and versatile tool  in       a year after the smithsonian launched an ambitious program to digitalize about     of its     million holdings  its digitization program office team spent two weeks scanning what it now refers to as the cosmic buddha a short video shows the team running a laser scanner over the statue  taking minute measurements  essentially abstracting the statue into a dense constellation of white dots over which the program then superimposes  like a skin  photographic images of the reliefs  the result is a   d model accessible on two monitors in the gallery as well as remotely through the show   s website  we can  among other things  rotate the sculpture  zoom in on reliefs  manipulate contrast and lighting  highlight distinct sections  and access explanations facilitated by their precision  ms  howard is investigating what the reliefs reveal about their iconography   s central asian origins and how and when this kind of image changed in china  it began as a figure associated with the earthly shakyamuni  but shifted over time to one representing a celestial and primordial buddha  vairocana  at the smithsonian  meanwhile  mr  wilson has been better able to compare stylistic traits  leading him to narrow down the statue   s date to the northern qi dynasty           at the same time  the laser scans allow geologist janet douglas to detect microscopic signs of weathering and recarving  the latter explains why  of the     plus faces  only one has carved features  and those incongruously cartoonish  all other faces are smooth  like canvases awaiting the painter   s brush this brings us to a broader question  it is striking  even to the naked eye  that the carvers never exploited the figure   s swells and curves  the scenes feel flat  as though transposed from drawings  which is exactly what mr  wilson believes happened  so he asked the digitization team to create what the program labels    drawings flat maps     an option in a drop down menu on the right  another drop down menu  this one in the left hand margin  allows us to remove the photographic texture and  tweaking controls marked    occlusion     convert the reliefs into line drawings  if mr  wilson is right  these re create what an imperial workshop once provided the carvers  once painted in the palette of the day   green  blue  red  white  black and gold   they might also provide an approximation of court paintings  furthering our understanding of this artistically prolific period  as for the statue itself  imagining it   and perhaps someday seeing it in the   d model   covered in individual  colorful scenes changes our experience  from decorated object of devotion it rises before us as a didactic tool a monk may once have used the way today speakers deploy powerpoint  to help the message stick   ms  lawrence writes about asian and islamic art for the
