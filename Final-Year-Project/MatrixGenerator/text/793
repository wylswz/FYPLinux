   i think men insist on the fact that they   re right  that   s the reason they don   t ask for directions    
 ms  hirsch  it doesn   t surprise me that you have only    of mutual funds managed by solo female managers  i think there are a lot more women i see in research as opposed to portfolio management  though i think that   s beginning to change  i think research was the first area to accept women  because many came from good schools  and they were very detail driven and focused  and great researchers  excellent researchers   wsj  why do you think the number of female money managers has remained low  even as the percentage of women grows in other financial roles   ms  hirsch  they don   t want you to become a portfolio manager and drive the returns unless you   ve proven you   ve done it before  so someone has to give you a chance  so what comes first  it becomes a little tricky   wsj  what can a woman bring to a portfolio management role that a man could not   ms  hirsch  women do have a better temperament for money management because they have an instinct for the recognition that perhaps you   re missing something  women recognize that early on  i think men tend to insist on the fact that they   re right  that   s the reason they don   t ask for directions   because they   re right  that way  you end up being not just a bit wrong  but very  very wrong  women tend to pull back much more quickly  and  then tend to  think maybe this isn   t the right approach   wsj  a recent study that appeared in the journal scientific reports suggested that male hormones can drive reckless trading decisions  does that jibe with your experience   ms  hirsch  when i was at lehman  i remember working with one of the traders who would double down whenever a stock broke down  as a money manager and a female  if a stock is breaking down  it means there   s something we missed  it   s an indication of larger issues   wsj  is there any hope for significant growth in the number of female fund managers   ms  hirsch  there has to be an educational component that allows women to be more comfortable with these positions  i was lucky to have a research background     i   d love to see that at school  financial research where logic is rewarded and investment sense is taught  i   ve seen it happening selectively  my niece called me while she was in school  about    years ago   there was a school stock picking contest  she had chosen taser as her stock choice 
where are the female fund managers   july      it was one of these moonshots and she wanted to know  when do you sell it    what should i do     she asked  i said     what do you think     she said     i think  sell it        bingo     i said     anything that goes up like that  goes down like that    portfolio management needs to be done in an unbiased methodical way  being aggressive is not going to help  mr  curran  a writer in denton  texas  is a regular contributor to dow jones newswires and the wall street journal  email him at rob curran dowjones com
