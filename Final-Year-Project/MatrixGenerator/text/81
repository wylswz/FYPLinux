when i was nineteen  i met a guy who   d made millions as an entrepreneur  it was purely by chance  in a pub in surry hills  and we started drinking together after we bonded over a mix up around my fries and his potato wedges back then  i was just a kid working on a big goal of dominating the music industry with my first company  i didn   t stand a chance  but i hadn   t realized it yet we talked for a couple of hours  and he gave me some advice  a few pieces of knowledge that have stuck with me ever since  around how to work for the things that matter  and how to watch your money he didn   t care that i was a nobody  that i   d never accomplished anything big  that i wasn   t much more than a drop out with a dream  he treated me with the same respect he would have shown a ceo or an investor  he treated me like i was a real person who mattered  and he gave a shit i   m still not a big deal         i   m a guy with a blog and a little digital empire and a lot more dreams  and i   ve picked up a nice list of failures and one or two wins  and i   m not a tech superstar or a goddamn celebrity but i like to think i   ve come a long way since then  and i   ve never forgotten the way that guy treated me right now  i   m working my ass off  and i take meetings with millionaires  i take meetings with vcs and podcasters and script writers and entrepreneurs  those meetings are awesome  and there   s often some incredible opportunities attached but i had a    minute skype call the other day with an awesome studlife isn   t something you should play favorites with  you could miss out on some amazing people  i wrote about networking recently  about the assholes who dismiss anyone they don   t think is useful to    em  and i think that attitude is so sad when you keep an open mind about people  and you try and give them some of your time  you could be incredibly surprised by the value they add  iknow my way of thinking has been altered over and over again by the people i   ve taken a moment to stop and hang out with i know it   s not scaleable  and i   m probably ignoring the best productivity advice out there by making myself available to a lot of different people  but it doesn   t take as much effort as you   d think  i do it in the spare    minutes i have  while i   m waiting for my eggs and coffee in the morning  i do it on the treadmill when i   m running i don   t always give people as much of my time as i   d like         i only have the same    hours as everyone else         but i do my best  even if it   s just a few lines in an email  because people deserve that  and they   re worth it i might not be able to measure their worth  or add them to a big fancy spreadsheetcalled    important people with important titles    but that doesn   t make them less interesting from brown u who completely took me by surprise largely because she asked a lot of questions that most people don   t  she challenged me to think about the answers i gave  a lot more than most interviewers do  i   ve come up with   blog ideas just based on the conversation we had i had an email from a guy who   s come out of cancer treatment and is rebuilding his life  it was staggering to think about the obstacles he   s jumped over to still be swinging punches and getting out there  and we   ve talked every day since  he   s inspired me to get back into meditation i like to think there   s more people like that in the world  and i   m sure there is  those people are the ones who can make dreams come true  and i   ve got big ideas that i want to throw onto the world   s stage  so i want them to give me the time of day when i need it and i can   t hope for that  i   d have no right to even imagine it  if i didn   t do the same thing for the people who want a moment of my time my time is precious to me  after all  i could make and lose a million bucks in a year on a roll of the dice  but i can   t ever make back a moment or a single second of my life i   m going to be honest with you  i can   t always talk with everyone  and some people are going to fall through the cracks  i stay busy  and i stay active  and i don   t have a fool proof method for managing my emails  but the intention is there  and if i had my way  i   d be able to get to every single person who wants to talk i   m the founder of creatomic i am incredibly excited about changing lives www jonwestenberg comwww creatomic coi   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
