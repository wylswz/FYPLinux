for reasons both good and bad  clinton and trump are two of the least liked candidates ever to run for president  lots and lots of people see both candidates as corrupt and untrustworthy and morally bankrupt  and they bitterly resent being told they have to choose between two bad options and so  rather than vote for the    lesser of two evils     many progressives have decided not to vote at all i see the appeal  especially for people in non swing states  what   s the point of taking time out of your day to go fill in a bubble next to the name of someone you don   t really want as your president  the outcome of the election doesn   t change  but you feel like you   ve betrayed your principles and the whole thing makes you want a shower i don   t agree  and i   ve spilled a lot of ink over the past few months about why all progressives should vote for clinton  but i won   t reiterate my reasons here  at this point  i   m not going to convince anyone else  if you refuse to choose between clinton and trump  i can   t make you vote for one of them but here   s my plea to those tempted to stay home the presidential race always looms large in the national conversation  and this year the high stakes race between hillary clinton and donald trump is particularly riveting  but there is another election happening in the shadow of the hillary trump showdown  and it   s hugely important republicans currently control congress  with    of the     senate seats and     of the     house seats  and it   s wreacked havoc on the progressive legislative agenda   see  e g  republican refusal to confirm merrick garland for the supreme court  there are    senate seats in play this year  of which    are currently held by republicans  democrats need to take back only   to gain control of the senate  the same is true of the house  with all     seats up for grabs in       republicans currently control the house with     seats  and democrats need to take    seats to gain control and races are tightening in unexpected places  john mccain  r  may lose to ann kirkpatrick  d  in arizona  largely because of increased turnout among latino voters  marco rubio  r  looks like he may lose his florida seat to patrick murphy  d  after his failed presidential campaign  mark kirk  r  is facing a real challenge from iraq war veteran and former assistant secretary of the veterans affairs department tammy duckworth  d  in illinois  the senate races in indiana  missouri  nevada  new hampshire  north carolina  and pennsylvania are too close to call the house battleground races are all over the map  and not necessarily where you   d expect them to be         in california  colorado  new york  new jersey  and texas  as well as the broader swing states of florida  nevada  new hampshire  arizona  and illinois house and senate swing states are not necessarily the same as presidential swing states  parts of texas are in play for control of the house  your vote counts more than you think it does progressive voter turnout would make the difference in all those contested races  and the difference between a democratic or republican legislature  imagine what we could do with a democratic house and senate and a new supreme court justice appointed by a democratic president and good progressive turnout means victories all the way down to the very bottom of the ticket         not just house and senate  but also judges  city councils  school boards  local prosecutors  city comptrollers  etc vote for the government officials who aren   t campaigning on the national stage but who run the daily business of america   s states and cities  these are the people who decide whether school zoning keeps black kids in failing schools  whether college sexual assault is appropriately investigated and prosecuted  whether to allow fracking in residential neighborhoods  there are referendums on many states    ballots about serious issues like reducing regulation on gambling and increasing taxes on gasoline and those smaller elections and referendums can be decided by tiny margins            votes  or even     your vote really  really counts a serious shift left in down ballot races would shape the political landscape in a subtle but profound way for years to come i   ll say it again  if you really want to make a statement of your refusal to vote for hillary  you can even leave the president spot on your ballot blank  but don   t punish your underpaid  hardworking school board officials for the sins of a presidential candidate they will never even meet the election is less than a month away  and today is the last day for voter registration in fifteen states   florida   s deadline has been extended to october    because of hurricane matthew  even if i haven   t fully convinced you not to sit out the election  a lot can happen in    days  and something might happen to make you want to vote  you   ve got nothing to lose by registering now  before it
