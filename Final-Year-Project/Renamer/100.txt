He touched my skin as if it would last forever,though he knew forever echoed impossible.Boundaries burst,embracing the safety of his familiarity,obliging this disasterin his arms.Shipwreck me,flay me so I can feel you again.Each layera reminderof our new flesh,together in this -in this beautiful mess.Once bitten twice shy no longer lingeredon his scent.Time was of no essence.Rhyme and reason faded out,reasons to rhyme chimed in.Waves of forgotten lies,now merge withwinds of togetherness.Of friendships before romance, of love,before we grewto hate.Of years of growthin placesonly we shared,in spaces we bothshed.We marvel in the now,ignoring the stingof when.As we lay bare,dampened sheetsremind usignorance is bliss.We’re the calmbefore this storm,inevitably awaitingdeparture.Healing with words. Poetry lover. Truth seeker
