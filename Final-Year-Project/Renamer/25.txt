“There ain’t no clean way to make a hundred million bucks…. Somewhere along the line guys got pushed to the wall, nice little businesses got the ground cut out from under them… Decent people lost their jobs…. Big money is big power and big power gets used wrong. It’s the system.”I read this passage from a book by Raymond Chandler last week, on a flight between Schipol and Beijing. I read it over and over again, and I thought about the business successes that we chase and admire.I thought about what $100,000,000 really looks like. I thought about the people who have to lose, for anyone to win that big. And I thought about tech millions and startup millions, and the little people.I realized it’s often very true. When that much money is made, there’s often another story, somewhere. The story of the other little companies and dreamers who tried and failed and were broken by their failure.Small businesses turn into big business in the blink of an eye. Big business can transform the world, with phones and laptops and cars and buildings and — these days — rockets.People win and lose. Big money comes, and big money goes. But what really counts is the way you think about what you’re building and what you’re doing. What really counts is how much you care about people.If you’re building a company or making a product, think about whether or not you’re creating new opportunities. Think about how you’re contributing to people in your community, in your society, in your world.It’s enough for your bottom line to ensure that you’re profitable — but if you can sacrifice a few bucks here and there to invest in people, it might take longer to pay off, but it will always pay off.Envision a world where you create opportunities for more people than just you 🔑If you’re a business who operates by cutting deals that are bad for the rest of the world and good for you, if you’re a business that doesn’t give a good Goddamn about who gets left out, whether they’re partners that you betray or customers whose needs you don’t look after, you’re a part of the problem.Do you know why the Sony Playstation was born? Why the console that beat the shit of out of Nintendo was created? It was because Nintendo screwed over their partners, Sony, and pulled a deal out from under them to manufacture the Nintendo Playstation. Nice going, right?Don’t run your business like you’re an HBO villain. It’ll catch up with you 🔑I’m not saying give your products away. I’m not saying that making money is a bad thing. I’m saying that Volkswagen decided they’d make a tonne of money by faking their cars’ environmental impact, with no regard for the world, their customers or the long game.That simple choice ended up costing them. It cost them more money than they were ever in line to make in their little scheme in the first place. It cost them more money than I’ll ever make in my life. They made a dumb, irresponsible decision based on profit, and it bit them in the ass.Your bottom line matters, but it’s not the only thing that does 🔑If I’ve got one bone to pick with a lot of businesses, it’s that they act like disrupting everything, ignoring the rules, pretending that laws and traditions don’t apply to them is their right. They repeat “run fast and break stuff” like it’s their religious mantra.They try and avoid tax while using the roads and resources that the rest of us pay taxes to support. They act like governments and communities who balk at their behavior are anti-progress. At the end of the day, that’s not their right. And people have long memories.Just because you can ignore the rules, doesn’t mean you should🔑Because here’s the good news. It doesn’t have to be true. It doesn’t have to be true that to succeed you have to hurt the world. It doesn’t have to be true that to make money you have to fuck people who don’t deserve it, or who think differently, or who don’t move as fast as you.I’m the founder of Creatomic.I am incredibly excited about changing lives.www.jonwestenberg.comwww.creatomic.coIf I die, turn my tweets into a book. www.jonwestenberg.comPosts on how to build things you love, embrace creativity and make cool shit. www.creatomic.co
