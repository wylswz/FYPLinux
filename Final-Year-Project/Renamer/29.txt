I am currently on parental leave, so these days I wake up to the freedom of an empty calendar that’s ready…If you’re like many of us, you feel starved for time.This post originally appeared on SpinSucks.com here.Seen less as a perk and increasingly more as a savvy business decision, companies around the world are embracing remote work options.Inspired by @joelgascoigne’s Zero Notifications blog post, I took the plunge and purged my iPhone of all (but the most essential) notifications.Now, a year later, it’s time to share my thoughts on the experiment.Overheard in my English classroom….Me: ♪♫ Interjections! Show excitement! Or emotion! ♫♪Student: What on earth was that?Me: Schoolhouse Rock, of course!Student: Again? When did they make those things, anyway? The 1880s?I’ve helped thousands of people — from NFL Coaches and Four Star Generals to best-selling authors and hedge fund managers — feel less busy and get more done.
