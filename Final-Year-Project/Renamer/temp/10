<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
“Dragons,”
said
Mollander.
He
snatched
a
withered
apple
off
the
ground
and
tossed
it
hand
to
hand.

“Throw
the
apple,”
urged
Alleras
the
Sphinx.
He
slipped
an
arrow
from
his
quiver
and
nocked
it
to
his
bowstring.

“I
should
like
to
see
a
dragon.”
Roone
was
the
youngest
of
them,
a
chunky
boy
still
two
years
shy
of
manhood.
“I
should
like
that
very
much.”

And
I
should
like
to
sleep
with
Rosey’s
arms
around
me,
Pate
thought.
He
shifted
restlessly
on
the
bench.
By
the
morrow
the
girl
could
well
be
his.
I
will
take
her
far
from
Oldtown,
across
the
narrow
sea
to
one
of
the
Free
Cities.
There
were
no
maesters
there,
no
one
to
accuse
him.

He
could
hear
Emma’s
laughter
coming
through
a
shuttered
window
overhead,
mingled
with
the
deeper
voice
of
the
man
she
was
entertaining.
She
was
the
oldest
of
the
serving
wenches
at
the
Quill
and
Tankard,
forty
if
she
was
a
day,
but
still
pretty
in
a
fleshy
sort
of
way.
Rosey
was
her
daughter,
fifteen
and
freshly
flowered.
Emma
had
decreed
that
Rosey’s
maidenhead
would
cost
a
golden
dragon.
Pate
had
saved
nine
silver
stags
and
a
pot
of
copper
stars
and
pennies,
for
all
the
good
that
would
do
him.
He
would
have
stood
a
better
chance
of
hatching
a
real
dragon
than
saving
up
enough
coin
to
make
a
golden
one.

“You
were
born
too
late
for
dragons,
lad,”
Armen
the
Acolyte
told
Roone.
Armen
wore
a
leather
thong
about
his
neck,
strung
with
links
of
pewter,
tin,
lead,
and
copper,
and
like
most
acolytes
he
seemed
to
believe
that
novices
had
turnips
growing
from
their
shoulders
in
place
of
heads.
“The
last
one
perished
during
the
reign
of
King
Aegon
the
Third.”

“The
last
dragon
in
Westeros,”
insisted
Mollander.

“Throw
the
apple,”
Alleras
urged
again.
He
was
a
comely
youth,
their
Sphinx.
All
the
serving
wenches
doted
on
him.
Even
Rosey
would
sometimes
touch
him
on
the
arm
when
she
brought
him
wine,
and
Pate
had
to
gnash
his
teeth
and
pretend
not
to
see.

“The
last
dragon
in
Westeros
was
the
last
dragon,”
said
Armen
doggedly.
“That
is
well
known.”

“The
apple,”
Alleras
said.
“Unless
you
mean
to
eat
it.”

“Here.”
Dragging
his
clubfoot,
Mollander
took
a
short
hop,
whirled,
and
whipped
the
apple
sidearm
into
the
mists
that
hung
above
the
Honeywine.
If
not
for
his
foot,
he
would
have
been
a
knight
like
his
father.
He
had
the
strength
for
it
in
those
thick
arms
and
broad
shoulders.
Far
and
fast
the
apple
flew...

...but
not
as
fast
as
the
arrow
that
whistled
after
it,
a
yard-long
shaft
of
golden
wood
fletched
with
scarlet
feathers.
Pate
did
not
see
the
arrow
catch
the
apple,
but
he
heard
it.
A
soft
chunk
echoed
back
across
the
river,
followed
by
a
splash.

Mollander
whistled.
“You
cored
it.
Sweet.”

Not
half
as
sweet
as
Rosey.
Pate
loved
her
hazel
eyes
and
budding
breasts,
and
the
way
she
smiled
every
time
she
saw
him.
He
loved
the
dimples
in
her
cheeks.
Sometimes
she
went
barefoot
as
she
served,
to
feel
the
grass
beneath
her
feet.
He
loved
that
too.
He
loved
the
clean
fresh
smell
of
her,
the
way
her
hair
curled
behind
her
ears.
He
even
loved
her
toes.
One
night
she’d
let
him
rub
her
feet
and
play
with
them,
and
he’d
made
up
a
funny
tale
for
every
toe
to
keep
her
giggling.

Perhaps
he
would
do
better
to
remain
on
this
side
of
the
narrow
sea.
He
could
buy
a
donkey
with
the
coin
he’d
saved,
and
he
and
Rosey
could
take
turns
riding
it
as
they
wandered
Westeros.
Ebrose
might
not
think
him
worthy
of
the
silver,
but
Pate
knew
how
to
set
a
bone
and
leech
a
fever.
The
smallfolk
would
be
grateful
for
his
help.
If
he
could
learn
to
cut
hair
and
shave
beards,
he
might
even
be
a
barber.
That
would
be
enough,
he
told
himself,
so
long
as
I
had
Rosey.
Rosey
was
all
that
he
wanted
in
the
world.

That
had
not
always
been
so.
Once
he
had
dreamed
of
being
a
maester
in
a
castle,
in
service
to
some
open-handed
lord
who
would
honor
him
for
his
wisdom
and
bestow
a
fine
white
horse
on
him
to
thank
him
for
his
service.
How
high
he’d
ride,
how
nobly,
smiling
down
at
the
smallfolk
when
he
passed
them
on
the
road...

One
night
in
the
Quill
and
Tankard’s
common
room,
after
his
second
tankard
of
fearsomely
strong
cider,
Pate
had
boasted
that
he
would
not
always
be
a
novice.
“Too
true,”
Lazy
Leo
had
called
out.
“You’ll
be
a
former
novice,
herding
swine.”

He
drained
the
dregs
of
his
tankard.
The
torchlit
terrace
of
the
Quill
and
Tankard
was
an
island
of
light
in
a
sea
of
mist
this
morning.
Downriver,
the
distant
beacon
of
the
Hightower
floated
in
the
damp
of
night
like
a
hazy
orange
moon,
but
the
light
did
little
to
lift
his
spirits.

The
alchemist
should
have
come
by
now.
Had
it
all
been
some
cruel
jape,
or
had
something
happened
to
the
man?
It
would
not
have
been
the
first
time
that
good
fortune
had
turned
sour
on
Pate.
He
had
once
counted
himself
lucky
to
be
chosen
to
help
old
Archmaester
Walgrave
with
the
ravens,
never
dreaming
that
before
long
he
would
also
be
fetching
the
man’s
meals,
sweeping
out
his
chambers,
and
dressing
him
every
morning.
Everyone
said
that
Walgrave
had
forgotten
more
of
ravencraft
than
most
maesters
ever
knew,
so
Pate
assumed
a
black
iron
link
was
the
least
that
he
could
hope
for,
only
to
find
that
Walgrave
could
not
grant
him
one.
The
old
man
remained
an
archmaester
only
by
courtesy.
As
great
a
maester
as
once
he’d
been,
now
his
robes
concealed
soiled
smallclothes
oft
as
not,
and
half
a
year
ago
some
acolytes
found
him
weeping
in
the
Library,
unable
to
find
his
way
back
to
his
chambers.
Maester
Gormon
sat
below
the
iron
mask
in
Walgrave’s
place,
the
same
Gormon
who
had
once
accused
Pate
of
theft.

In
the
apple
tree
beside
the
water,
a
nightingale
began
to
sing.
It
was
a
sweet
sound,
a
welcome
respite
from
the
harsh
screams
and
endless
quorking
of
the
ravens
he
had
tended
all
day
long.
The
white
ravens
knew
his
name,
and
would
mutter
it
to
each
other
whenever
they
caught
sight
of
him,
“Pate,
Pate,
Pate,”
until
he
wanted
to
scream.
The
big
white
birds
were
Archmaester
Walgrave’s
pride.
He
wanted
them
to
eat
him
when
he
died,
but
Pate
half
suspected
that
they
meant
to
eat
him
too.

Perhaps
it
was
the
fearsomely
strong
cider—he
had
not
come
here
to
drink,
but
Alleras
had
been
buying
to
celebrate
his
copper
link,
and
guilt
had
made
him
thirsty—but
it
almost
sounded
as
if
the
nightingale
were
trilling
gold
for
iron,
gold
for
iron,
gold
for
iron.
Which
was
passing
strange,
because
that
was
what
the
stranger
had
said
the
night
Rosey
brought
the
two
of
them
together.
“Who
are
you?”
Pate
had
demanded
of
him,
and
the
man
had
replied,
“An
alchemist.
I
can
change
iron
into
gold.”
And
then
the
coin
was
in
his
hand,
dancing
across
his
knuckles,
the
soft
yellow
gold
shining
in
the
candlelight.
On
one
side
was
a
three-headed
dragon,
on
the
other
the
head
of
some
dead
king.
Gold
for
iron,
Pate
remembered,
you
won’t
do
better.
Do
you
want
her?
Do
you
love
her?
“I
am
no
thief,”
he
had
told
the
man
who
called
himself
the
alchemist,
“I
am
a
novice
of
the
Citadel.”
The
alchemist
had
bowed
his
head,
and
said,
“If
you
should
reconsider,
I
shall
return
here
three
days
hence,
with
my
dragon.”

Three
days
had
passed.
Pate
had
returned
to
the
Quill
and
Tankard,
still
uncertain
what
he
was,
but
instead
of
the
alchemist
he’d
found
Mollander
and
Armen
and
the
Sphinx,
with
Roone
in
tow.
It
would
have
raised
suspicions
not
to
join
them.

The
Quill
and
Tankard
never
closed.
For
six
hundred
years
it
had
been
standing
on
its
island
in
the
Honeywine,
and
never
once
had
its
doors
been
shut
to
trade.
Though
the
tall,
timbered
building
leaned
toward
the
south
the
way
novices
sometimes
leaned
after
a
tankard,
Pate
expected
that
the
inn
would
go
on
standing
for
another
six
hundred
years,
selling
wine
and
ale
and
fearsomely
strong
cider
to
rivermen
and
seamen,
smiths
and
singers,
priests
and
princes,
and
the
novices
and
acolytes
of
the
Citadel.

“Oldtown
is
not
the
world,”
declared
Mollander,
too
loudly.
He
was
a
knight’s
son,
and
drunk
as
drunk
could
be.
Since
they
brought
him
word
of
his
father’s
death
upon
the
Blackwater,
he
got
drunk
most
every
night.
Even
in
Oldtown,
far
from
the
fighting
and
safe
behind
its
walls,
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
had
touched
them
all...
although
Archmaester
Benedict
insisted
that
there
had
never
been
a
war
of
five
kings,
since
Renly
Baratheon
had
been
slain
before
Balon
Greyjoy
had
crowned
himself.

“My
father
always
said
the
world
was
bigger
than
any
lord’s
castle,”
Mollander
went
on.
“Dragons
must
be
the
least
of
the
things
a
man
might
find
in
Qarth
and
Asshai
and
Yi
Ti.
These
sailors’
stories...”

“...are
stories
told
by
sailors,”
Armen
interrupted.
“Sailors,
my
dear
Mollander.
Go
back
down
to
the
docks,
and
I
wager
you’ll
find
sailors
who’ll
tell
you
of
the
mermaids
that
they
bedded,
or
how
they
spent
a
year
in
the
belly
of
a
fish.”

“How
do
you
know
they
didn’t?”
Mollander
thumped
through
the
grass,
looking
for
more
apples.
“You’d
need
to
be
down
the
belly
yourself
to
swear
they
weren’t.
One
sailor
with
a
story,
aye,
a
man
might
laugh
at
that,
but
when
oarsmen
off
four
different
ships
tell
the
same
tale
in
four
different
tongues...”

“The
tales
are
not
the
same,”
insisted
Armen.
“Dragons
in
Asshai,
dragons
in
Qarth,
dragons
in
Meereen,
Dothraki
dragons,
dragons
freeing
slaves...
each
telling
differs
from
the
last.”

“Only
in
details.”
Mollander
grew
more
stubborn
when
he
drank,
and
even
when
sober
he
was
bullheaded.
“All
speak
of
dragons,
and
a
beautiful
young
queen.”

The
only
dragon
Pate
cared
about
was
made
of
yellow
gold.
He
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
alchemist.
The
third
day.
He
said
he’d
be
here.

“There’s
another
apple
near
your
foot,”
Alleras
called
to
Mollander,
“and
I
still
have
two
arrows
in
my
quiver.”

“Fuck
your
quiver.”
Mollander
scooped
up
the
windfall.
“This
one’s
wormy,”
he
complained,
but
he
threw
it
anyway.
The
arrow
caught
the
apple
as
it
began
to
fall
and
sliced
it
clean
in
two.
One
half
landed
on
a
turret
roof,
tumbled
to
a
lower
roof,
bounced,
and
missed
Armen
by
a
foot.
“If
you
cut
a
worm
in
two,
you
make
two
worms,”
the
acolyte
informed
them.

“If
only
it
worked
that
way
with
apples,
no
one
would
ever
need
go
hungry,”
said
Alleras
with
one
of
his
soft
smiles.
The
Sphinx
was
always
smiling,
as
if
he
knew
some
secret
jape.
It
gave
him
a
wicked
look
that
went
well
with
his
pointed
chin,
widow’s
peak,
and
dense
mat
of
close-cropped
jet-black
curls.

Alleras
would
make
a
maester.
He
had
only
been
at
the
Citadel
for
a
year,
yet
already
he
had
forged
three
links
of
his
maester’s
chain.
Armen
might
have
more,
but
each
of
his
had
taken
him
a
year
to
earn.
Still,
he
would
make
a
maester
too.
Roone
and
Mollander
remained
pink-necked
novices,
but
Roone
was
very
young
and
Mollander
preferred
drinking
to
reading.

Pate,
though...

He
had
been
five
years
at
the
Citadel,
arriving
when
he
was
no
more
than
three-and-ten,
yet
his
neck
remained
as
pink
as
it
had
been
on
the
day
he
first
arrived
from
the
westerlands.
Twice
had
he
believed
himself
ready.
The
first
time
he
had
gone
before
Archmaester
Vaellyn
to
demonstrate
his
knowledge
of
the
heavens.
Instead
he
learned
how
Vinegar
Vaellyn
had
earned
that
name.
It
took
Pate
two
years
to
summon
up
the
courage
to
try
again.
This
time
he
submitted
himself
to
kindly
old
Archmaester
Ebrose,
renowned
for
his
soft
voice
and
gentle
hands,
but
Ebrose’s
sighs
had
somehow
proved
just
as
painful
as
Vaellyn’s
barbs.

“One
last
apple,”
promised
Alleras,
“and
I
will
tell
you
what
I
suspect
about
these
dragons.”

“What
could
you
know
that
I
don’t?”
grumbled
Mollander.
He
spied
an
apple
on
a
branch,
jumped
up,
pulled
it
down,
and
threw.
Alleras
drew
his
bowstring
back
to
his
ear,
turning
gracefully
to
follow
the
target
in
flight.
He
loosed
his
shaft
just
as
the
apple
began
to
fall.

“You
always
miss
your
last
shot,”
said
Roone.

The
apple
splashed
down
into
the
river,
untouched.

“See?”
said
Roone.

“The
day
you
make
them
all
is
the
day
you
stop
improving.”
Alleras
unstrung
his
longbow
and
eased
it
into
its
leather
case.
The
bow
was
carved
from
goldenheart,
a
rare
and
fabled
wood
from
the
Summer
Isles.
Pate
had
tried
to
bend
it
once,
and
failed.
The
Sphinx
looks
slight,
but
there’s
strength
in
those
slim
arms,
he
reflected,
as
Alleras
threw
a
leg
across
the
bench
and
reached
for
his
wine
cup.
“The
dragon
has
three
heads,”
he
announced
in
his
soft
Dornish
drawl.

“Is
this
a
riddle?”
Roone
wanted
to
know.
“Sphinxes
always
speak
in
riddles
in
the
tales.”

“No
riddle.”
Alleras
sipped
his
wine.
The
rest
of
them
were
quaffing
tankards
of
the
fearsomely
strong
cider
that
the
Quill
and
Tankard
was
renowned
for,
but
he
preferred
the
strange,
sweet
wines
of
his
mother’s
country.
Even
in
Oldtown
such
wines
did
not
come
cheap.

It
had
been
Lazy
Leo
who
dubbed
Alleras
“the
Sphinx.”
A
sphinx
is
a
bit
of
this,
a
bit
of
that:
a
human
face,
the
body
of
a
lion,
the
wings
of
a
hawk.
Alleras
was
the
same:
his
father
was
a
Dornishman,
his
mother
a
black-skinned
Summer
Islander.
His
own
skin
was
dark
as
teak.
And
like
the
green
marble
sphinxes
that
flanked
the
Citadel’s
main
gate,
Alleras
had
eyes
of
onyx.

“No
dragon
has
ever
had
three
heads
except
on
shields
and
banners,”
Armen
the
Acolyte
said
firmly.
“That
was
a
heraldic
charge,
no
more.
Furthermore,
the
Targaryens
are
all
dead.”

“Not
all,”
said
Alleras.
“The
Beggar
King
had
a
sister.”

“I
thought
her
head
was
smashed
against
a
wall,”
said
Roone.

“No,”
said
Alleras.
“It
was
Prince
Rhaegar’s
young
son
Aegon
whose
head
was
dashed
against
the
wall
by
the
Lion
of
Lannister’s
brave
men.
We
speak
of
Rhaegar’s
sister,
born
on
Dragonstone
before
its
fall.
The
one
they
called
Daenerys.”

“The
Stormborn.
I
recall
her
now.”
Mollander
lifted
his
tankard
high,
sloshing
the
cider
that
remained.
“Here’s
to
her!”
He
gulped,
slammed
his
empty
tankard
down,
belched,
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Where’s
Rosey?
Our
rightful
queen
deserves
another
round
of
cider,
wouldn’t
you
say?”

Armen
the
Acolyte
looked
alarmed.
“Lower
your
voice,
fool.
You
should
not
even
jape
about
such
things.
You
never
know
who
could
be
listening.
The
Spider
has
ears
everywhere.”

“Ah,
don’t
piss
your
breeches,
Armen.
I
was
proposing
a
drink,
not
a
rebellion.”

Pate
heard
a
chuckle.
A
soft,
sly
voice
called
out
from
behind
him.
“I
always
knew
you
were
a
traitor,
Hopfrog.”
Lazy
Leo
was
slouching
by
the
foot
of
the
old
plank
bridge,
draped
in
satin
striped
in
green
and
gold,
with
a
black
silk
half
cape
pinned
to
his
shoulder
by
a
rose
of
jade.
The
wine
he’d
dribbled
down
his
front
had
been
a
robust
red,
judging
from
the
color
of
the
spots.
A
lock
of
his
ash-blond
hair
fell
down
across
one
eye.

Mollander
bristled
at
the
sight
of
him.
“Bugger
that.
Go
away.
You
are
not
welcome
here.”
Alleras
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
to
calm
him,
whilst
Armen
frowned.
“Leo.
My
lord.
I
had
understood
that
you
were
still
confined
to
the
Citadel
for...”

“...three
more
days.”
Lazy
Leo
shrugged.
“Perestan
says
the
world
is
forty
thousand
years
old.
Mollos
says
five
hundred
thousand.
What
are
three
days,
I
ask
you?”
Though
there
were
a
dozen
empty
tables
on
the
terrace,
Leo
sat
himself
at
theirs.
“Buy
me
a
cup
of
Arbor
gold,
Hopfrog,
and
perhaps
I
won’t
inform
my
father
of
your
toast.
The
tiles
turned
against
me
at
the
Checkered
Hazard,
and
I
wasted
my
last
stag
on
supper.
Suckling
pig
in
plum
sauce,
stuffed
with
chestnuts
and
white
truffles.
A
man
must
eat.
What
did
you
lads
have?”

“Mutton,”
muttered
Mollander.
He
sounded
none
too
pleased
about
it.
“We
shared
a
haunch
of
boiled
mutton.”

“I’m
certain
it
was
filling.”
Leo
turned
to
Alleras.
“A
lord’s
son
should
be
open-handed,
Sphinx.
I
understand
you
won
your
copper
link.
I’ll
drink
to
that.”

Alleras
smiled
back
at
him.
“I
only
buy
for
friends.
And
I
am
no
lord’s
son,
I’ve
told
you
that.
My
mother
was
a
trader.”

Leo’s
eyes
were
hazel,
bright
with
wine
and
malice.
“Your
mother
was
a
monkey
from
the
Summer
Isles.
The
Dornish
will
fuck
anything
with
a
hole
between
its
legs.
Meaning
no
offense.
You
may
be
brown
as
a
nut,
but
at
least
you
bathe.
Unlike
our
spotted
pig
boy.”
He
waved
a
hand
toward
Pate.

If
I
hit
him
in
the
mouth
with
my
tankard,
I
could
knock
out
half
his
teeth,
Pate
thought.
Spotted
Pate
the
pig
boy
was
the
hero
of
a
thousand
ribald
stories:
a
good-hearted,
empty-headed
lout
who
always
managed
to
best
the
fat
lordlings,
haughty
knights,
and
pompous
septons
who
beset
him.
Somehow
his
stupidity
would
turn
out
to
have
been
a
sort
of
uncouth
cunning;
the
tales
always
ended
with
Spotted
Pate
sitting
on
a
lord’s
high
seat
or
bedding
some
knight’s
daughter.
But
those
were
stories.
In
the
real
world
pig
boys
never
fared
so
well.
Pate
sometimes
thought
his
mother
must
have
hated
him
to
have
named
him
as
she
did.

Alleras
was
no
longer
smiling.
“You
will
apologize.”

“Will
I?”
said
Leo.
“How
can
I,
with
my
throat
so
dry...”

“You
shame
your
House
with
every
word
you
say,”
Alleras
told
him.
“You
shame
the
Citadel
by
being
one
of
us.”

“I
know.
So
buy
me
some
wine,
that
I
might
drown
my
shame.”

Mollander
said,
“I
would
tear
your
tongue
out
by
the
roots.”

“Truly?
Then
how
would
I
tell
you
about
the
dragons?”
Leo
shrugged
again.
“The
mongrel
has
the
right
of
it.
The
Mad
King’s
daughter
is
alive,
and
she’s
hatched
herself
three
dragons.”

“Three?”
said
Roone,
astonished.

Leo
patted
his
hand.
“More
than
two
and
less
than
four.
I
would
not
try
for
my
golden
link
just
yet
if
I
were
you.”

“You
leave
him
be,”
warned
Mollander.

“Such
a
chivalrous
Hopfrog.
As
you
wish.
Every
man
off
every
ship
that’s
sailed
within
a
hundred
leagues
of
Qarth
is
speaking
of
these
dragons.
A
few
will
even
tell
you
that
they’ve
seen
them.
The
Mage
is
inclined
to
believe
them.”

Armen
pursed
his
lips
in
disapproval.
“Marwyn
is
unsound.
Archmaester
Perestan
would
be
the
first
to
tell
you
that.”

“Archmaester
Ryam
says
so
too,”
said
Roone.

Leo
yawned.
“The
sea
is
wet,
the
sun
is
warm,
and
the
menagerie
hates
the
mastiff.”

He
has
a
mocking
name
for
everyone,
thought
Pate,
but
he
could
not
deny
that
Marwyn
looked
more
a
mastiff
than
a
maester.
As
if
he
wants
to
bite
you.
The
Mage
was
not
like
other
maesters.
People
said
that
he
kept
company
with
whores
and
hedge
wizards,
talked
with
hairy
Ibbenese
and
pitch-black
Summer
Islanders
in
their
own
tongues,
and
sacrificed
to
queer
gods
at
the
little
sailors’
temples
down
by
the
wharves.
Men
spoke
of
seeing
him
down
in
the
undercity,
in
rat
pits
and
black
brothels,
consorting
with
mummers,
singers,
sellswords,
even
beggars.
Some
even
whispered
that
once
he
had
killed
a
man
with
his
fists.

When
Marwyn
had
returned
to
Oldtown,
after
spending
eight
years
in
the
east
mapping
distant
lands,
searching
for
lost
books,
and
studying
with
warlocks
and
shadowbinders,
Vinegar
Vaellyn
had
dubbed
him
“Marwyn
the
Mage.”
The
name
was
soon
all
over
Oldtown,
to
Vaellyn’s
vast
annoyance.
“Leave
spells
and
prayers
to
priests
and
septons
and
bend
your
wits
to
learning
truths
a
man
can
trust
in,”
Archmaester
Ryam
had
once
counseled
Pate,
but
Ryam’s
ring
and
rod
and
mask
were
yellow
gold,
and
his
maester’s
chain
had
no
link
of
Valyrian
steel.

Armen
looked
down
his
nose
at
Lazy
Leo.
He
had
the
perfect
nose
for
it,
long
and
thin
and
pointed.
“Archmaester
Marwyn
believes
in
many
curious
things,”
he
said,
“but
he
has
no
more
proof
of
dragons
than
Mollander.
Just
more
sailors’
stories.”

“You’re
wrong,”
said
Leo.
“There
is
a
glass
candle
burning
in
the
Mage’s
chambers.”

A
hush
fell
over
the
torchlit
terrace.
Armen
sighed
and
shook
his
head.
Mollander
began
to
laugh.
The
Sphinx
studied
Leo
with
his
big
black
eyes.
Roone
looked
lost.

Pate
knew
about
the
glass
candles,
though
he
had
never
seen
one
burn.
They
were
the
worst-kept
secret
of
the
Citadel.
It
was
said
that
they
had
been
brought
to
Oldtown
from
Valyria
a
thousand
years
before
the
Doom.
He
had
heard
there
were
four;
one
was
green
and
three
were
black,
and
all
were
tall
and
twisted.

“What
are
these
glass
candles?”
asked
Roone.

Armen
the
Acolyte
cleared
his
throat.
“The
night
before
an
acolyte
says
his
vows,
he
must
stand
a
vigil
in
the
vault.
No
lantern
is
permitted
him,
no
torch,
no
lamp,
no
taper...
only
a
candle
of
obsidian.
He
must
spend
the
night
in
darkness,
unless
he
can
light
that
candle.
Some
will
try.
The
foolish
and
the
stubborn,
those
who
have
made
a
study
of
these
so-called
higher
mysteries.
Often
they
cut
their
fingers,
for
the
ridges
on
the
candles
are
said
to
be
as
sharp
as
razors.
Then,
with
bloody
hands,
they
must
wait
upon
the
dawn,
brooding
on
their
failure.
Wiser
men
simply
go
to
sleep,
or
spend
their
night
in
prayer,
but
every
year
there
are
always
a
few
who
must
try.”

“Yes.”
Pate
had
heard
the
same
stories.
“But
what’s
the
use
of
a
candle
that
casts
no
light?”

“It
is
a
lesson,”
Armen
said,
“the
last
lesson
we
must
learn
before
we
don
our
maester’s
chains.
The
glass
candle
is
meant
to
represent
truth
and
learning,
rare
and
beautiful
and
fragile
things.
It
is
made
in
the
shape
of
a
candle
to
remind
us
that
a
maester
must
cast
light
wherever
he
serves,
and
it
is
sharp
to
remind
us
that
knowledge
can
be
dangerous.
Wise
men
may
grow
arrogant
in
their
wisdom,
but
a
maester
must
always
remain
humble.
The
glass
candle
reminds
us
of
that
as
well.
Even
after
he
has
said
his
vow
and
donned
his
chain
and
gone
forth
to
serve,
a
maester
will
think
back
on
the
darkness
of
his
vigil
and
remember
how
nothing
that
he
did
could
make
the
candle
burn...
for
even
with
knowledge,
some
things
are
not
possible.”

Lazy
Leo
burst
out
laughing.
“Not
possible
for
you,
you
mean.
I
saw
the
candle
burning
with
my
own
eyes.”

“You
saw
some
candle
burning,
I
don’t
doubt,”
said
Armen.
“A
candle
of
black
wax,
perhaps.”

“I
know
what
I
saw.
The
light
was
queer
and
bright,
much
brighter
than
any
beeswax
or
tallow
candle.
It
cast
strange
shadows
and
the
flame
never
flickered,
not
even
when
a
draft
blew
through
the
open
door
behind
me.”

Armen
crossed
his
arms.
“Obsidian
does
not
burn.”

“Dragonglass,”
Pate
said.
“The
smallfolk
call
it
dragonglass.”
Somehow
that
seemed
important.

“They
do,”
mused
Alleras,
the
Sphinx,
“and
if
there
are
dragons
in
the
world
again...”

“Dragons
and
darker
things,”
said
Leo.
“The
grey
sheep
have
closed
their
eyes,
but
the
mastiff
sees
the
truth.
Old
powers
waken.
Shadows
stir.
An
age
of
wonder
and
terror
will
soon
be
upon
us,
an
age
for
gods
and
heroes.”
He
stretched,
smiling
his
lazy
smile.
“That’s
worth
a
round,
I’d
say.”

“We’ve
drunk
enough,”
said
Armen.
“Morn
will
be
upon
us
sooner
than
we’d
like,
and
Archmaester
Ebrose
will
be
speaking
on
the
properties
of
urine.
Those
who
mean
to
forge
a
silver
link
would
do
well
not
to
miss
his
talk.”

“Far
be
it
from
me
to
keep
you
from
the
piss
tasting,”
said
Leo.
“Myself,
I
prefer
the
taste
of
Arbor
gold.”

“If
the
choice
is
piss
or
you,
I’ll
drink
piss.”
Mollander
pushed
back
from
the
table.
“Come,
Roone.”

The
Sphinx
reached
for
his
bowcase.
“It’s
bed
for
me
as
well.
I
expect
I’ll
dream
of
dragons
and
glass
candles.”

“All
of
you?”
Leo
shrugged.
“Well,
Rosey
will
remain.
Perhaps
I’ll
wake
our
little
sweetmeat
and
make
a
woman
of
her.”

Alleras
saw
the
look
on
Pate’s
face.
“If
he
does
not
have
a
copper
for
a
cup
of
wine,
he
cannot
have
a
dragon
for
the
girl.”

“Aye,”
said
Mollander.
“Besides,
it
takes
a
man
to
make
a
woman.
Come
with
us,
Pate.
Old
Walgrave
will
wake
when
the
sun
comes
up.
He’ll
be
needing
you
to
help
him
to
the
privy.”

If
he
remembers
who
I
am
today.
Archmaester
Walgrave
had
no
trouble
telling
one
raven
from
another,
but
he
was
not
so
good
with
people.
Some
days
he
seemed
to
think
Pate
was
someone
named
Cressen.
“Not
just
yet,”
he
told
his
friends.
“I’m
going
to
stay
awhile.”
Dawn
had
not
broken,
not
quite.
The
alchemist
might
still
be
coming,
and
Pate
meant
to
be
here
if
he
did.

“As
you
wish,”
said
Armen.
Alleras
gave
Pate
a
lingering
look,
then
slung
his
bow
over
one
slim
shoulder
and
followed
the
others
toward
the
bridge.
Mollander
was
so
drunk
he
had
to
walk
with
a
hand
on
Roone’s
shoulder
to
keep
from
falling.
The
Citadel
was
no
great
distance
as
the
raven
flies,
but
none
of
them
were
ravens
and
Oldtown
was
a
veritable
labyrinth
of
a
city,
all
wynds
and
crisscrossing
alleys
and
narrow
crookback
streets.
“Careful,”
Pate
heard
Armen
say
as
the
river
mists
swallowed
up
the
four
of
them,
“the
night
is
damp,
and
the
cobbles
will
be
slippery.”

When
they
were
gone,
Lazy
Leo
considered
Pate
sourly
across
the
table.
“How
sad.
The
Sphinx
has
stolen
off
with
all
his
silver,
abandoning
me
to
Spotted
Pate
the
pig
boy.”
He
stretched,
yawning.
“How
is
our
lovely
little
Rosey,
pray?”

“She’s
sleeping,”
Pate
said
curtly.

“Naked,
I
don’t
doubt.”
Leo
grinned.
“Do
you
think
she’s
truly
worth
a
dragon?
One
day
I
suppose
I
must
find
out.”

Pate
knew
better
than
to
reply
to
that.

Leo
needed
no
reply.
“I
expect
that
once
I’ve
broken
in
the
wench,
her
price
will
fall
to
where
even
pig
boys
will
be
able
to
afford
her.
You
ought
to
thank
me.”

I
ought
to
kill
you,
Pate
thought,
but
he
was
not
near
drunk
enough
to
throw
away
his
life.
Leo
had
been
trained
to
arms,
and
was
known
to
be
deadly
with
bravo’s
blade
and
dagger.
And
if
Pate
should
somehow
kill
him,
it
would
mean
his
own
head
too.
Leo
had
two
names
where
Pate
had
only
one,
and
his
second
was
Tyrell.
Ser
Moryn
Tyrell,
commander
of
the
City
Watch
of
Oldtown,
was
Leo’s
father.
Mace
Tyrell,
Lord
of
Highgarden
and
Warden
of
the
South,
was
Leo’s
cousin.
And
Oldtown’s
Old
Man,
Lord
Leyton
of
the
Hightower,
who
numbered
“Protector
of
the
Citadel”
amongst
his
many
titles,
was
a
sworn
bannerman
of
House
Tyrell.
Let
it
go,
Pate
told
himself.
He
says
these
things
just
to
wound
me.

The
mists
were
lightening
to
the
east.
Dawn,
Pate
realized.
Dawn
has
come,
and
the
alchemist
has
not.
He
did
not
know
whether
he
should
laugh
or
cry.
Am
I
still
a
thief
if
I
put
it
all
back
and
no
one
ever
knows?
It
was
another
question
that
he
had
no
answer
for,
like
those
that
Ebrose
and
Vaellyn
had
once
asked
him.

When
he
pushed
back
from
the
bench
and
got
to
his
feet,
the
fearsomely
strong
cider
all
went
to
his
head
at
once.
He
had
to
put
a
hand
on
the
table
to
steady
himself.
“Leave
Rosey
be,”
he
said,
by
way
of
parting.
“Just
leave
her
be,
or
I
may
kill
you.”

Leo
Tyrell
flicked
the
hair
back
from
his
eye.
“I
do
not
fight
duels
with
pig
boys.
Go
away.”

Pate
turned
and
crossed
the
terrace.
His
heels
rang
against
the
weathered
planks
of
the
old
bridge.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
other
side,
the
eastern
sky
was
turning
pink.
The
world
is
wide,
he
told
himself.
If
I
bought
that
donkey,
I
could
still
wander
the
roads
and
byways
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
leeching
the
smallfolk
and
picking
nits
out
of
their
hair.
I
could
sign
on
to
some
ship,
pull
an
oar,
and
sail
to
Qarth
by
the
Jade
Gates
to
see
these
bloody
dragons
for
myself.
I
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
old
Walgrave
and
the
ravens.

Yet
somehow
his
feet
turned
back
toward
the
Citadel.

When
the
first
shaft
of
sunlight
broke
through
the
clouds
to
the
east,
morning
bells
began
to
peal
from
the
Sailor’s
Sept
down
by
the
harbor.
The
Lord’s
Sept
joined
in
a
moment
later,
then
the
Seven
Shrines
from
their
gardens
across
the
Honeywine,
and
finally
the
Starry
Sept
that
had
been
the
seat
of
the
High
Septon
for
a
thousand
years
before
Aegon
landed
at
King’s
Landing.
They
made
a
mighty
music.
Though
not
so
sweet
as
one
small
nightingale.

He
could
hear
singing
too,
beneath
the
pealing
of
the
bells.
Each
morning
at
first
light
the
red
priests
gathered
to
welcome
the
sun
outside
their
modest
wharfside
temple.
For
the
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors.
Pate
had
heard
them
cry
those
words
a
hundred
times,
asking
their
god
R’hllor
to
save
them
from
the
darkness.
The
Seven
were
gods
enough
for
him,
but
he
had
heard
that
Stannis
Baratheon
worshiped
at
the
nightfires
now.
He
had
even
put
the
fiery
heart
of
R’hllor
on
his
banners
in
place
of
the
crowned
stag.
If
he
should
win
the
Iron
Throne,
we’ll
all
need
to
learn
the
words
of
the
red
priests’
song,
Pate
thought,
but
that
was
not
likely.
Tywin
Lannister
had
smashed
Stannis
and
R’hllor
upon
the
Blackwater,
and
soon
enough
he
would
finish
them
and
mount
the
head
of
the
Baratheon
pretender
on
a
spike
above
the
gates
of
King’s
Landing.

As
the
night’s
mists
burned
away,
Oldtown
took
form
around
him,
emerging
ghostlike
from
the
predawn
gloom.
Pate
had
never
seen
King’s
Landing,
but
he
knew
it
was
a
daub-and-wattle
city,
a
sprawl
of
mud
streets,
thatched
roofs,
and
wooden
hovels.
Oldtown
was
built
in
stone,
and
all
its
streets
were
cobbled,
down
to
the
meanest
alley.
The
city
was
never
more
beautiful
than
at
break
of
day.
West
of
the
Honeywine,
the
Guildhalls
lined
the
bank
like
a
row
of
palaces.
Upriver,
the
domes
and
towers
of
the
Citadel
rose
on
both
sides
of
the
river,
connected
by
stone
bridges
crowded
with
halls
and
houses.
Downstream,
below
the
black
marble
walls
and
arched
windows
of
the
Starry
Sept,
the
manses
of
the
pious
clustered
like
children
gathered
round
the
feet
of
an
old
dowager.

And
beyond,
where
the
Honeywine
widened
into
Whispering
Sound,
rose
the
Hightower,
its
beacon
fires
bright
against
the
dawn.
From
where
it
stood
atop
the
bluffs
of
Battle
Island,
its
shadow
cut
the
city
like
a
sword.
Those
born
and
raised
in
Oldtown
could
tell
the
time
of
day
by
where
that
shadow
fell.
Some
claimed
a
man
could
see
all
the
way
to
the
Wall
from
the
top.
Perhaps
that
was
why
Lord
Leyton
had
not
made
the
descent
in
more
than
a
decade,
preferring
to
rule
his
city
from
the
clouds.

A
butcher’s
cart
rumbled
past
Pate
down
the
river
road,
five
piglets
in
the
back
squealing
in
distress.
Dodging
from
its
path,
he
just
avoided
being
spattered
as
a
townswoman
emptied
a
pail
of
night
soil
from
a
window
overhead.
When
I
am
a
maester
in
a
castle
I
will
have
a
horse
to
ride,
he
thought.
Then
he
tripped
upon
a
cobble
and
wondered
who
he
was
fooling.
There
would
be
no
chain
for
him,
no
seat
at
a
lord’s
high
table,
no
tall
white
horse
to
ride.
His
days
would
be
spent
listening
to
ravens
quork
and
scrubbing
shit
stains
off
Archmaester
Walgrave’s
smallclothes.

He
was
on
one
knee,
trying
to
wipe
the
mud
off
his
robes,
when
a
voice
said,
“Good
morrow,
Pate.”

The
alchemist
was
standing
over
him.

Pate
rose.
“The
third
day...
you
said
you
would
be
at
the
Quill
and
Tankard.”

“You
were
with
your
friends.
It
was
not
my
wish
to
intrude
upon
your
fellowship.”
The
alchemist
wore
a
hooded
traveler’s
cloak,
brown
and
nondescript.
The
rising
sun
was
peeking
over
the
rooftops
behind
his
shoulder,
so
it
was
hard
to
make
out
the
face
beneath
his
hood.
“Have
you
decided
what
you
are?”

Must
he
make
me
say
it?
“I
suppose
I
am
a
thief.”

“I
thought
you
might
be.”

The
hardest
part
had
been
getting
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
pull
the
strongbox
from
underneath
Archmaester
Walgrave’s
bed.
Though
the
box
was
stoutly
made
and
bound
with
iron,
its
lock
was
broken.
Maester
Gormon
had
suspected
Pate
of
breaking
it,
but
that
wasn’t
true.
Walgrave
had
broken
the
lock
himself,
after
losing
the
key
that
opened
it.

Inside,
Pate
had
found
a
bag
of
silver
stags,
a
lock
of
yellow
hair
tied
up
in
a
ribbon,
a
painted
miniature
of
a
woman
who
resembled
Walgrave
(even
to
her
mustache),
and
a
knight’s
gauntlet
made
of
lobstered
steel.
The
gauntlet
had
belonged
to
a
prince,
Walgrave
claimed,
though
he
could
no
longer
seem
to
recall
which
one.
When
Pate
shook
it,
the
key
fell
out
onto
the
floor.

If
I
pick
that
up,
I
am
a
thief,
he
remembered
thinking.
The
key
was
old
and
heavy,
made
of
black
iron;
supposedly
it
opened
every
door
at
the
Citadel.
Only
the
archmaesters
had
such
keys.
The
others
carried
theirs
upon
their
person
or
hid
them
away
in
some
safe
place,
but
if
Walgrave
had
hidden
his,
no
one
would
ever
have
seen
it
again.
Pate
snatched
up
the
key
and
had
been
halfway
to
the
door
before
turning
back
to
take
the
silver
too.
A
thief
was
a
thief,
whether
he
stole
a
little
or
a
lot.
“Pate,”
one
of
the
white
ravens
had
called
after
him,
“Pate,
Pate,
Pate.”

“Do
you
have
my
dragon?”
he
asked
the
alchemist.

“If
you
have
what
I
require.”

“Give
it
here.
I
want
to
see.”
Pate
did
not
intend
to
let
himself
be
cheated.

“The
river
road
is
not
the
place.
Come.”

He
had
no
time
to
think
about
it,
to
weigh
his
choices.
The
alchemist
was
walking
away.
Pate
had
to
follow
or
lose
Rosey
and
the
dragon
both,
forever.
He
followed.
As
they
walked,
he
slipped
his
hand
up
into
his
sleeve.
He
could
feel
the
key,
safe
inside
the
hidden
pocket
he
had
sewn
there.
Maester’s
robes
were
full
of
pockets.
He
had
known
that
since
he
was
a
boy.

He
had
to
hurry
to
keep
pace
with
the
alchemist’s
longer
strides.
They
went
down
an
alley,
around
a
corner,
through
the
old
Thieves
Market,
along
Ragpicker’s
Wynd.
Finally,
the
man
turned
into
another
alley,
narrower
than
the
first.
“This
is
far
enough,”
said
Pate.
“There’s
no
one
about.
We’ll
do
it
here.”

“As
you
wish.”

“I
want
my
dragon.”

“To
be
sure.”
The
coin
appeared.
The
alchemist
made
it
walk
across
his
knuckles,
the
way
he
had
when
Rosey
brought
the
two
of
them
together.
In
the
morning
light
the
dragon
glittered
as
it
moved,
and
gave
the
alchemist’s
fingers
a
golden
glow.

Pate
grabbed
it
from
his
hand.
The
gold
felt
warm
against
his
palm.
He
brought
it
to
his
mouth
and
bit
down
on
it
the
way
he’d
seen
men
do.
If
truth
be
told,
he
wasn’t
sure
what
gold
should
taste
like,
but
he
did
not
want
to
look
a
fool.

“The
key?”
the
alchemist
inquired
politely.

Something
made
Pate
hesitate.
“Is
it
some
book
you
want?”
Some
of
the
old
Valyrian
scrolls
down
in
the
locked
vaults
were
said
to
be
the
only
surviving
copies
in
the
world.

“What
I
want
is
none
of
your
concern.”

“No.”
It’s
done,
Pate
told
himself.
Go.
Run
back
to
the
Quill
and
Tankard,
wake
Rosey
with
a
kiss,
and
tell
her
she
belongs
to
you.
Yet
still
he
lingered.
“Show
me
your
face.”

“As
you
wish.”
The
alchemist
pulled
his
hood
down.

He
was
just
a
man,
and
his
face
was
just
a
face.
A
young
man’s
face,
ordinary,
with
full
cheeks
and
the
shadow
of
a
beard.
A
scar
showed
faintly
on
his
right
cheek.
He
had
a
hooked
nose,
and
a
mat
of
dense
black
hair
that
curled
tightly
around
his
ears.
It
was
not
a
face
Pate
recognized.
“I
do
not
know
you.”

“Nor
I
you.”

“Who
are
you?”

“A
stranger.
No
one.
Truly.”

“Oh.”
Pate
had
run
out
of
words.
He
drew
out
the
key
and
put
it
in
the
stranger’s
hand,
feeling
light-headed,
almost
giddy.
Rosey,
he
reminded
himself.
“We’re
done,
then.”

He
was
halfway
down
the
alley
when
the
cobblestones
began
to
move
beneath
his
feet.
The
stones
are
slick
and
wet,
he
thought,
but
that
was
not
it.
He
could
feel
his
heart
hammering
in
his
chest.
“What’s
happening?”
he
said.
His
legs
had
turned
to
water.
“I
don’t
understand.”

“And
never
will,”
a
voice
said
sadly.

The
cobblestones
rushed
up
to
kiss
him.
Pate
tried
to
cry
for
help,
but
his
voice
was
failing
too.

His
last
thought
was
of
Rosey.





THE
PROPHET

The
prophet
was
drowning
men
on
Great
Wyk
when
they
came
to
tell
him
that
the
king
was
dead.

It
was
a
bleak,
cold
morning,
and
the
sea
was
as
leaden
as
the
sky.
The
first
three
men
had
offered
their
lives
to
the
Drowned
God
fearlessly,
but
the
fourth
was
weak
in
faith
and
began
to
struggle
as
his
lungs
cried
out
for
air.
Standing
waist-deep
in
the
surf,
Aeron
seized
the
naked
boy
by
the
shoulders
and
pushed
his
head
back
down
as
he
tried
to
snatch
a
breath.
“Have
courage,”
he
said.
“We
came
from
the
sea,
and
to
the
sea
we
must
return.
Open
your
mouth
and
drink
deep
of
god’s
blessing.
Fill
your
lungs
with
water,
that
you
may
die
and
be
reborn.
It
does
no
good
to
fight.”

Either
the
boy
could
not
hear
him
with
his
head
beneath
the
waves,
or
else
his
faith
had
utterly
deserted
him.
He
began
to
kick
and
thrash
so
wildly
that
Aeron
had
to
call
for
help.
Four
of
his
drowned
men
waded
out
to
seize
the
wretch
and
hold
him
underwater.
“Lord
God
who
drowned
for
us,”
the
priest
prayed,
in
a
voice
as
deep
as
the
sea,
“let
Emmond
your
servant
be
reborn
from
the
sea,
as
you
were.
Bless
him
with
salt,
bless
him
with
stone,
bless
him
with
steel.”

Finally,
it
was
done.
No
more
air
was
bubbling
from
his
mouth,
and
all
the
strength
had
gone
out
of
his
limbs.
Facedown
in
the
shallow
sea
floated
Emmond,
pale
and
cold
and
peaceful.

That
was
when
the
Damphair
realized
that
three
horsemen
had
joined
his
drowned
men
on
the
pebbled
shore.
Aeron
knew
the
Sparr,
a
hatchet-faced
old
man
with
watery
eyes
whose
quavery
voice
was
law
on
this
part
of
Great
Wyk.
His
son
Steffarion
accompanied
him,
with
another
youth
whose
dark
red
fur-lined
cloak
was
pinned
at
the
shoulder
with
an
ornate
brooch
that
showed
the
black-and-gold
warhorn
of
the
Goodbrothers.
One
of
Gorold’s
sons,
the
priest
decided
at
a
glance.
Three
tall
sons
had
been
born
to
Goodbrother’s
wife
late
in
life,
after
a
dozen
daughters,
and
it
was
said
that
no
man
could
tell
one
son
from
the
others.
Aeron
Damphair
did
not
deign
to
try.
Whether
this
be
Greydon
or
Gormond
or
Gran,
the
priest
had
no
time
for
him.

He
growled
a
brusque
command,
and
his
drowned
men
seized
the
dead
boy
by
his
arms
and
legs
to
carry
him
above
the
tideline.
The
priest
followed,
naked
but
for
a
sealskin
clout
that
covered
his
private
parts.
Goosefleshed
and
dripping,
he
splashed
back
onto
land,
across
cold
wet
sand
and
sea-scoured
pebbles.
One
of
his
drowned
men
handed
him
a
robe
of
heavy
roughspun
dyed
in
mottled
greens
and
blues
and
greys,
the
colors
of
the
sea
and
the
Drowned
God.
Aeron
donned
the
robe
and
pulled
his
hair
free.
Black
and
wet,
that
hair;
no
blade
had
touched
it
since
the
sea
had
raised
him
up.
It
draped
his
shoulders
like
a
ragged,
ropy
cloak,
and
fell
down
past
his
waist.
Aeron
wove
strands
of
seaweed
through
it,
and
through
his
tangled,
uncut
beard.

His
drowned
men
formed
a
circle
around
the
dead
boy,
praying.
Norjen
worked
his
arms
whilst
Rus
knelt
astride
him,
pumping
on
his
chest,
but
all
moved
aside
for
Aeron.
He
pried
apart
the
boy’s
cold
lips
with
his
fingers
and
gave
Emmond
the
kiss
of
life,
and
again,
and
again,
until
the
sea
came
gushing
from
his
mouth.
The
boy
began
to
cough
and
spit,
and
his
eyes
blinked
open,
full
of
fear.

Another
one
returned.
It
was
a
sign
of
the
Drowned
God’s
favor,
men
said.
Every
other
priest
lost
a
man
from
time
to
time,
even
Tarle
the
Thrice-Drowned,
who
had
once
been
thought
so
holy
that
he
was
picked
to
crown
a
king.
But
never
Aeron
Greyjoy.
He
was
the
Damphair,
who
had
seen
the
god’s
own
watery
halls
and
returned
to
tell
of
it.
“Rise,”
he
told
the
sputtering
boy
as
he
slapped
him
on
his
naked
back.
“You
have
drowned
and
been
returned
to
us.
What
is
dead
can
never
die.”

“But
rises.”
The
boy
coughed
violently,
bringing
up
more
water.
“Rises
again.”
Every
word
was
bought
with
pain,
but
that
was
the
way
of
the
world;
a
man
must
fight
to
live.
“Rises
again.”
Emmond
staggered
to
his
feet.
“Harder.
And
stronger.”

“You
belong
to
the
god
now,”
Aeron
told
him.
The
other
drowned
men
gathered
round
and
each
gave
him
a
punch
and
a
kiss
to
welcome
him
to
the
brotherhood.
One
helped
him
don
a
roughspun
robe
of
mottled
blue
and
green
and
grey.
Another
presented
him
with
a
driftwood
cudgel.
“You
belong
to
the
sea
now,
so
the
sea
has
armed
you,”
Aeron
said.
“We
pray
that
you
shall
wield
your
cudgel
fiercely,
against
all
the
enemies
of
our
god.”

Only
then
did
the
priest
turn
to
the
three
riders,
watching
from
their
saddles.
“Have
you
come
to
be
drowned,
my
lords?”

The
Sparr
coughed.
“I
was
drowned
as
a
boy,”
he
said,
“and
my
son
upon
his
name
day.”

Aeron
snorted.
That
Steffarion
Sparr
had
been
given
to
the
Drowned
God
soon
after
birth
he
had
no
doubt.
He
knew
the
manner
of
it
too,
a
quick
dip
into
a
tub
of
seawater
that
scarce
wet
the
infant’s
head.
Small
wonder
the
ironborn
had
been
conquered,
they
who
once
held
sway
everywhere
the
sound
of
waves
was
heard.
“That
is
no
true
drowning,”
he
told
the
riders.
“He
that
does
not
die
in
truth
cannot
hope
to
rise
from
death.
Why
have
you
come,
if
not
to
prove
your
faith?”

“Lord
Gorold’s
son
came
seeking
you,
with
news.”
The
Sparr
indicated
the
youth
in
the
red
cloak.

The
boy
looked
to
be
no
more
than
six-and-ten.
“Aye,
and
which
are
you?”
Aeron
demanded.

“Gormond.
Gormond
Goodbrother,
if
it
please
my
lord.”

“It
is
the
Drowned
God
we
must
please.
Have
you
been
drowned,
Gormond
Goodbrother?”

“On
my
name
day,
Damphair.
My
father
sent
me
to
find
you
and
bring
you
to
him.
He
needs
to
see
you.”

“Here
I
stand.
Let
Lord
Gorold
come
and
feast
his
eyes.”
Aeron
took
a
leather
skin
from
Rus,
freshly
filled
with
water
from
the
sea.
The
priest
pulled
out
the
cork
and
took
a
swallow.

“I
am
to
bring
you
to
the
keep,”
insisted
young
Gormond,
from
atop
his
horse.

He
is
afraid
to
dismount,
lest
he
get
his
boots
wet.
“I
have
the
god’s
work
to
do.”
Aeron
Greyjoy
was
a
prophet.
He
did
not
suffer
petty
lords
ordering
him
about
like
some
thrall.

“Gorold’s
had
a
bird,”
said
the
Sparr.

“A
maester’s
bird,
from
Pyke,”
Gormond
confirmed.

Dark
wings,
dark
words.
“The
ravens
fly
o’er
salt
and
stone.
If
there
are
tidings
that
concern
me,
speak
them
now.”

“Such
tidings
as
we
bear
are
for
your
ears
alone,
Damphair,”
the
Sparr
said.
“These
are
not
matters
I
would
speak
of
here
before
these
others.”

“These
others
are
my
drowned
men,
god’s
servants,
just
as
I
am.
I
have
no
secrets
from
them,
nor
from
our
god,
beside
whose
holy
sea
I
stand.”

The
horsemen
exchanged
a
look.
“Tell
him,”
said
the
Sparr,
and
the
youth
in
the
red
cloak
summoned
up
his
courage.
“The
king
is
dead,”
he
said,
as
plain
as
that.
Four
small
words,
yet
the
sea
itself
trembled
when
he
uttered
them.

Four
kings
there
were
in
Westeros,
yet
Aeron
did
not
need
to
ask
which
one
was
meant.
Balon
Greyjoy
ruled
the
Iron
Islands,
and
no
other.
The
king
is
dead.
How
can
that
be?
Aeron
had
seen
his
eldest
brother
not
a
moon’s
turn
past,
when
he
had
returned
to
the
Iron
Islands
from
harrying
the
Stony
Shore.
Balon’s
grey
hair
had
gone
half-white
whilst
the
priest
had
been
away,
and
the
stoop
in
his
shoulders
was
more
pronounced
than
when
the
longships
sailed.
Yet
all
in
all
the
king
had
not
seemed
ill.

Aeron
Greyjoy
had
built
his
life
upon
two
mighty
pillars.
Those
four
small
words
had
knocked
one
down.
Only
the
Drowned
God
remains
to
me.
May
he
make
me
as
strong
and
tireless
as
the
sea.
“Tell
me
the
manner
of
my
brother’s
death.”

“His
Grace
was
crossing
a
bridge
at
Pyke
when
he
fell
and
was
dashed
upon
the
rocks
below.”

The
Greyjoy
stronghold
stood
upon
a
broken
headland,
its
keeps
and
towers
built
atop
massive
stone
stacks
that
thrust
up
from
the
sea.
Bridges
knotted
Pyke
together;
arched
bridges
of
carved
stone
and
swaying
spans
of
hempen
rope
and
wooden
planks.
“Was
the
storm
raging
when
he
fell?”
Aeron
demanded
of
them.

“Aye,”
the
youth
said,
“it
was.”

“The
Storm
God
cast
him
down,”
the
priest
announced.
For
a
thousand
thousand
years
sea
and
sky
had
been
at
war.
From
the
sea
had
come
the
ironborn,
and
the
fish
that
sustained
them
even
in
the
depths
of
winter,
but
storms
brought
only
woe
and
grief.
“My
brother
Balon
made
us
great
again,
which
earned
the
Storm
God’s
wrath.
He
feasts
now
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls,
with
mermaids
to
attend
his
every
want.
It
shall
be
for
us
who
remain
behind
in
this
dry
and
dismal
vale
to
finish
his
great
work.”
He
pushed
the
cork
back
into
his
waterskin.
“I
shall
speak
with
your
lord
father.
How
far
from
here
to
Hammerhorn?”

“Six
leagues.
You
may
ride
pillion
with
me.”

“One
can
ride
faster
than
two.
Give
me
your
horse,
and
the
Drowned
God
will
bless
you.”

“Take
my
horse,
Damphair,”
offered
Steffarion
Sparr.

“No.
His
mount
is
stronger.
Your
horse,
boy.”

The
youth
hesitated
half
a
heartbeat,
then
dismounted
and
held
the
reins
for
the
Damphair.
Aeron
shoved
a
bare
black
foot
into
a
stirrup
and
swung
himself
onto
the
saddle.
He
was
not
fond
of
horses—they
were
creatures
from
the
green
lands
and
helped
to
make
men
weak—but
necessity
required
that
he
ride.
Dark
wings,
dark
words.
A
storm
was
brewing,
he
could
hear
it
in
the
waves,
and
storms
brought
naught
but
evil.
“Meet
with
me
at
Pebbleton
beneath
Lord
Merlyn’s
tower,”
he
told
his
drowned
men,
as
he
turned
the
horse’s
head.

The
way
was
rough,
up
hills
and
woods
and
stony
defiles,
along
a
narrow
track
that
oft
seemed
to
disappear
beneath
the
horse’s
hooves.
Great
Wyk
was
the
largest
of
the
Iron
Islands,
so
vast
that
some
of
its
lords
had
holdings
that
did
not
front
upon
the
holy
sea.
Gorold
Goodbrother
was
one
such.
His
keep
was
in
the
Hardstone
Hills,
as
far
from
the
Drowned
God’s
realm
as
any
place
in
the
isles.
Gorold’s
folk
toiled
down
in
Gorold’s
mines,
in
the
stony
dark
beneath
the
earth.
Some
lived
and
died
without
setting
eyes
upon
salt
water.
Small
wonder
that
such
folk
are
crabbed
and
queer.

As
Aeron
rode,
his
thoughts
turned
to
his
brothers.

Nine
sons
had
been
born
from
the
loins
of
Quellon
Greyjoy,
the
Lord
of
the
Iron
Islands.
Harlon,
Quenton,
and
Donel
had
been
born
of
Lord
Quellon’s
first
wife,
a
woman
of
the
Stonetrees.
Balon,
Euron,
Victarion,
Urrigon,
and
Aeron
were
the
sons
of
his
second,
a
Sunderly
of
Saltcliffe.
For
a
third
wife
Quellon
took
a
girl
from
the
green
lands,
who
gave
him
a
sickly
idiot
boy
named
Robin,
the
brother
best
forgotten.
The
priest
had
no
memory
of
Quenton
or
Donel,
who
had
died
as
infants.
Harlon
he
recalled
but
dimly,
sitting
grey-faced
and
still
in
a
windowless
tower
room
and
speaking
in
whispers
that
grew
fainter
every
day
as
the
greyscale
turned
his
tongue
and
lips
to
stone.
One
day
we
shall
feast
on
fish
together
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls,
the
four
of
us
and
Urri
too.

Nine
sons
had
been
born
from
the
loins
of
Quellon
Greyjoy,
but
only
four
had
lived
to
manhood.
That
was
the
way
of
this
cold
world,
where
men
fished
the
sea
and
dug
in
the
ground
and
died,
whilst
women
brought
forth
short-lived
children
from
beds
of
blood
and
pain.
Aeron
had
been
the
last
and
least
of
the
four
krakens,
Balon
the
eldest
and
boldest,
a
fierce
and
fearless
boy
who
lived
only
to
restore
the
ironborn
to
their
ancient
glory.
At
ten
he
scaled
the
Flint
Cliffs
to
the
Blind
Lord’s
haunted
tower.
At
thirteen
he
could
run
a
longship’s
oars
and
dance
the
finger
dance
as
well
as
any
man
in
the
isles.
At
fifteen
he
had
sailed
with
Dagmer
Cleftjaw
to
the
Stepstones
and
spent
a
summer
reaving.
He
slew
his
first
man
there
and
took
his
first
two
salt
wives.
At
seventeen
Balon
captained
his
own
ship.
He
was
all
that
an
elder
brother
ought
to
be,
though
he
had
never
shown
Aeron
aught
but
scorn.
I
was
weak
and
full
of
sin,
and
scorn
was
more
than
I
deserved.
Better
to
be
scorned
by
Balon
the
Brave
than
beloved
of
Euron
Crow’s
Eye.
And
if
age
and
grief
had
turned
Balon
bitter
with
the
years,
they
had
also
made
him
more
determined
than
any
man
alive.
He
was
born
a
lord’s
son
and
died
a
king,
murdered
by
a
jealous
god,
Aeron
thought,
and
now
the
storm
is
coming,
a
storm
such
as
these
isles
have
never
known.

It
was
long
after
dark
by
the
time
the
priest
espied
the
spiky
iron
battlements
of
the
Hammerhorn
clawing
at
the
crescent
moon.
Gorold’s
keep
was
hulking
and
blocky,
its
great
stones
quarried
from
the
cliff
that
loomed
behind
it.
Below
its
walls,
the
entrances
of
caves
and
ancient
mines
yawned
like
toothless
black
mouths.
The
Hammerhorn’s
iron
gates
had
been
closed
and
barred
for
the
night.
Aeron
beat
on
them
with
a
rock
until
the
clanging
woke
a
guard.

The
youth
who
admitted
him
was
the
image
of
Gormond,
whose
horse
he’d
taken.
“Which
one
are
you?”
Aeron
demanded.

“Gran.
My
father
awaits
you
within.”

The
hall
was
dank
and
drafty,
full
of
shadows.
One
of
Gorold’s
daughters
offered
the
priest
a
horn
of
ale.
Another
poked
at
a
sullen
fire
that
was
giving
off
more
smoke
than
heat.
Gorold
Goodbrother
himself
was
talking
quietly
with
a
slim
man
in
fine
grey
robes,
who
wore
about
his
neck
a
chain
of
many
metals
that
marked
him
for
a
maester
of
the
Citadel.

“Where
is
Gormond?”
Gorold
asked
when
he
saw
Aeron.

“He
returns
afoot.
Send
your
women
away,
my
lord.
And
the
maester
as
well.”
He
had
no
love
of
maesters.
Their
ravens
were
creatures
of
the
Storm
God,
and
he
did
not
trust
their
healing,
not
since
Urri.
No
proper
man
would
choose
a
life
of
thralldom,
nor
forge
a
chain
of
servitude
to
wear
about
his
throat.

“Gysella,
Gwin,
leave
us,”
Goodbrother
said
curtly.
“You
as
well,
Gran.
Maester
Murenmure
will
stay.”

“He
will
go,”
insisted
Aeron.

“This
is
my
hall,
Damphair.
It
is
not
for
you
to
say
who
must
go
and
who
remains.
The
maester
stays.”

The
man
lives
too
far
from
the
sea,
Aeron
told
himself.
“Then
I
shall
go,”
he
told
Goodbrother.
Dry
rushes
rustled
underneath
the
cracked
soles
of
his
bare
black
feet
as
he
turned
and
stalked
away.
It
seemed
he
had
ridden
a
long
way
for
naught.

Aeron
was
almost
at
the
door
when
the
maester
cleared
his
throat,
and
said,
“Euron
Crow’s
Eye
sits
the
Seastone
Chair.”

The
Damphair
turned.
The
hall
had
suddenly
grown
colder.
The
Crow’s
Eye
is
half
a
world
away.
Balon
sent
him
off
two
years
ago,
and
swore
that
it
would
be
his
life
if
he
returned.
“Tell
me,”
he
said
hoarsely.

“He
sailed
into
Lordsport
the
day
after
the
king’s
death,
and
claimed
the
castle
and
the
crown
as
Balon’s
eldest
brother,”
said
Gorold
Goodbrother.
“Now
he
sends
forth
ravens,
summoning
the
captains
and
the
kings
from
every
isle
to
Pyke,
to
bend
their
knees
and
do
him
homage
as
their
king.”

“No.”
Aeron
Damphair
did
not
weigh
his
words.
“Only
a
godly
man
may
sit
the
Seastone
Chair.
The
Crow’s
Eye
worships
naught
but
his
own
pride.”

“You
were
on
Pyke
not
long
ago,
and
saw
the
king,”
said
Goodbrother.
“Did
Balon
say
aught
to
you
of
the
succession?”

Aye.
They
had
spoken
in
the
Sea
Tower,
as
the
wind
howled
outside
the
windows
and
the
waves
crashed
restlessly
below.
Balon
had
shaken
his
head
in
despair
when
he
heard
what
Aeron
had
to
tell
him
of
his
last
remaining
son.
“The
wolves
have
made
a
weakling
of
him,
as
I
feared,”
the
king
had
said.
“I
pray
god
that
they
killed
him,
so
he
cannot
stand
in
Asha’s
way.”
That
was
Balon’s
blindness;
he
saw
himself
in
his
wild,
headstrong
daughter,
and
believed
she
could
succeed
him.
He
was
wrong
in
that,
and
Aeron
tried
to
tell
him
so.
“No
woman
will
ever
rule
the
ironborn,
not
even
a
woman
such
as
Asha,”
he
insisted,
but
Balon
could
be
deaf
to
things
he
did
not
wish
to
hear.

Before
the
priest
could
answer
Gorold
Goodbrother,
the
maester’s
mouth
flapped
open
once
again.
“By
rights
the
Seastone
Chair
belongs
to
Theon,
or
Asha
if
the
prince
is
dead.
That
is
the
law.”

“Green
land
law,”
said
Aeron
with
contempt.
“What
is
that
to
us?
We
are
ironborn,
the
sons
of
the
sea,
chosen
of
the
Drowned
God.
No
woman
may
rule
over
us,
nor
any
godless
man.”

“And
Victarion?”
asked
Gorold
Goodbrother.
“He
has
the
Iron
Fleet.
Will
Victarion
make
a
claim,
Damphair?”

“Euron
is
the
elder
brother...”
began
the
maester.

Aeron
silenced
him
with
a
look.
In
little
fishing
towns
and
great
stone
keeps
alike
such
a
look
from
Damphair
would
make
maids
feel
faint
and
send
children
shrieking
to
their
mothers,
and
it
was
more
than
sufficient
to
quell
the
chain-neck
thrall.
“Euron
is
elder,”
the
priest
said,
“but
Victarion
is
more
godly.”

“Will
it
come
to
war
between
them?”
asked
the
maester.

“Ironborn
must
not
spill
the
blood
of
ironborn.”

“A
pious
sentiment,
Damphair,”
said
Goodbrother,
“but
not
one
that
your
brother
shares.
He
had
Sawane
Botley
drowned
for
saying
that
the
Seastone
Chair
by
rights
belonged
to
Theon.”

“If
he
was
drowned,
no
blood
was
shed,”
said
Aeron.

The
maester
and
the
lord
exchanged
a
look.
“I
must
send
word
to
Pyke,
and
soon,”
said
Gorold
Goodbrother.
“Damphair,
I
would
have
your
counsel.
What
shall
it
be,
homage
or
defiance?”

Aeron
tugged
his
beard,
and
thought.
I
have
seen
the
storm,
and
its
name
is
Euron
Crow’s
Eye.
“For
now,
send
only
silence,”
he
told
the
lord.
“I
must
pray
on
this.”

“Pray
all
you
wish,”
the
maester
said.
“It
does
not
change
the
law.
Theon
is
the
rightful
heir,
and
Asha
next.”

“Silence!”
Aeron
roared.
“Too
long
have
the
ironborn
listened
to
you
chain-neck
maesters
prating
of
the
green
lands
and
their
laws.
It
is
time
we
listened
to
the
sea
again.
It
is
time
we
listened
to
the
voice
of
god.”
His
own
voice
rang
in
that
smoky
hall,
so
full
of
power
that
neither
Gorold
Goodbrother
nor
his
maester
dared
a
reply.
The
Drowned
God
is
with
me,
Aeron
thought.
He
has
shown
me
the
way.

Goodbrother
offered
him
the
comforts
of
the
castle
for
the
night,
but
the
priest
declined.
He
seldom
slept
beneath
a
castle
roof,
and
never
so
far
from
the
sea.
“Comforts
I
shall
know
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls
beneath
the
waves.
We
are
born
to
suffer,
that
our
sufferings
might
make
us
strong.
All
that
I
require
is
a
fresh
horse
to
carry
me
to
Pebbleton.”

That
Goodbrother
was
pleased
to
provide.
He
sent
his
son
Greydon
as
well,
to
show
the
priest
the
shortest
way
through
the
hills
down
to
the
sea.
Dawn
was
still
an
hour
off
when
they
set
forth,
but
their
mounts
were
hardy
and
surefooted,
and
they
made
good
time
despite
the
darkness.
Aeron
closed
his
eyes
and
said
a
silent
prayer,
and
after
a
while
began
to
drowse
in
the
saddle.

The
sound
came
softly,
the
scream
of
a
rusted
hinge.
“Urri,”
he
muttered,
and
woke,
fearful.
There
is
no
hinge
here,
no
door,
no
Urri.
A
flying
axe
took
off
half
of
Urri’s
hand
when
he
was
ten-and-four,
playing
at
the
finger
dance
whilst
his
father
and
his
elder
brothers
were
away
at
war.
Lord
Quellon’s
third
wife
had
been
a
Piper
of
Pinkmaiden
Castle,
a
girl
with
big
soft
breasts
and
brown
doe’s
eyes.
Instead
of
healing
Urri’s
hand
the
Old
Way,
with
fire
and
seawater,
she
gave
him
to
her
green
land
maester,
who
swore
that
he
could
sew
back
the
missing
fingers.
He
did
that,
and
later
he
used
potions
and
poltices
and
herbs,
but
the
hand
mortified
and
Urri
took
a
fever.
By
the
time
the
maester
sawed
his
arm
off,
it
was
too
late.

Lord
Quellon
never
returned
from
his
last
voyage;
the
Drowned
God
in
his
goodness
granted
him
a
death
at
sea.
It
was
Lord
Balon
who
came
back,
with
his
brothers
Euron
and
Victarion.
When
Balon
heard
what
had
befallen
Urri,
he
removed
three
of
the
maester’s
fingers
with
a
cook’s
cleaver
and
sent
his
father’s
Piper
wife
to
sew
them
back
on.
Poltices
and
potions
worked
as
well
for
the
maester
as
they
had
for
Urrigon.
He
died
raving,
and
Lord
Quellon’s
third
wife
followed
soon
thereafter,
as
the
midwife
drew
a
stillborn
daughter
from
her
womb.
Aeron
had
been
glad.
It
had
been
his
axe
that
sheared
off
Urri’s
hand,
whilst
they
danced
the
finger
dance
together,
as
friends
and
brothers
will.

It
shamed
him
still
to
recall
the
years
that
followed
Urri’s
death.
At
six-and-ten
he
called
himself
a
man,
but
in
truth
he
had
been
a
sack
of
wine
with
legs.
He
would
sing,
he
would
dance
(but
not
the
finger
dance,
never
again),
he
would
jape
and
jabber
and
make
mock.
He
played
the
pipes,
he
juggled,
he
rode
horses,
and
could
drink
more
than
all
the
Wynches
and
the
Botleys,
and
half
the
Harlaws
too.
The
Drowned
God
gives
every
man
a
gift,
even
him;
no
man
could
piss
longer
or
farther
than
Aeron
Greyjoy,
as
he
proved
at
every
feast.
Once
he
bet
his
new
longship
against
a
herd
of
goats
that
he
could
quench
a
hearthfire
with
no
more
than
his
cock.
Aeron
feasted
on
goat
for
a
year,
and
named
the
longship
Golden
Storm,
though
Balon
threatened
to
hang
him
from
her
mast
when
he
heard
what
sort
of
ram
his
brother
proposed
to
mount
upon
her
prow.

In
the
end
the
Golden
Storm
went
down
off
Fair
Isle
during
Balon’s
first
rebellion,
cut
in
half
by
a
towering
war
galley
called
Fury
when
Stannis
Baratheon
caught
Victarion
in
his
trap
and
smashed
the
Iron
Fleet.
Yet
the
god
was
not
done
with
Aeron,
and
carried
him
to
shore.
Some
fishermen
took
him
captive
and
marched
him
down
to
Lannisport
in
chains,
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
war
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock,
proving
that
krakens
can
piss
farther
and
longer
than
lions,
boars,
or
chickens.

That
man
is
dead.
Aeron
had
drowned
and
been
reborn
from
the
sea,
the
god’s
own
prophet.
No
mortal
man
could
frighten
him,
no
more
than
the
darkness
could...
nor
memories,
the
bones
of
the
soul.
The
sound
of
a
door
opening,
the
scream
of
a
rusted
iron
hinge.
Euron
has
come
again.
It
did
not
matter.
He
was
the
Damphair
priest,
beloved
of
the
god.

“Will
it
come
to
war?”
asked
Greydon
Goodbrother
as
the
sun
was
lightening
the
hills.
“A
war
of
brother
against
brother?”

“If
the
Drowned
God
wills
it.
No
godless
man
may
sit
the
Seastone
Chair.”
The
Crow’s
Eye
will
fight,
that
is
certain.
No
woman
could
defeat
him,
not
even
Asha;
women
were
made
to
fight
their
battles
in
the
birthing
bed.
And
Theon,
if
he
lived,
was
just
as
hopeless,
a
boy
of
sulks
and
smiles.
At
Winterfell
he
proved
his
worth,
such
that
it
was,
but
the
Crow’s
Eye
was
no
crippled
boy.
The
decks
of
Euron’s
ship
were
painted
red,
to
better
hide
the
blood
that
soaked
them.
Victarion.
The
king
must
be
Victarion,
or
the
storm
will
slay
us
all.

Greydon
left
him
when
the
sun
was
up,
to
take
the
news
of
Balon’s
death
to
his
cousins
in
their
towers
at
Downdelving,
Crow
Spike
Keep,
and
Corpse
Lake.
Aeron
continued
on
alone,
up
hills
and
down
vales
along
a
stony
track
that
drew
wider
and
more
traveled
as
he
neared
the
sea.
In
every
village
he
paused
to
preach,
and
in
the
yards
of
petty
lords
as
well.
“We
were
born
from
the
sea,
and
to
the
sea
we
all
return,”
he
told
them.
His
voice
was
as
deep
as
the
ocean,
and
thundered
like
the
waves.
“The
Storm
God
in
his
wrath
plucked
Balon
from
his
castle
and
cast
him
down,
and
now
he
feasts
beneath
the
waves
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls.”
He
raised
his
hands.
“Balon
is
dead!
The
king
is
dead!
Yet
a
king
will
come
again!
For
what
is
dead
may
never
die,
but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger!
A
king
will
rise!”

Some
of
those
who
heard
him
threw
down
their
hoes
and
picks
to
follow,
so
by
the
time
he
heard
the
crash
of
waves
a
dozen
men
walked
behind
his
horse,
touched
by
god
and
desirous
of
drowning.

Pebbleton
was
home
to
several
thousand
fisherfolk,
whose
hovels
huddled
round
the
base
of
a
square
towerhouse
with
a
turret
at
each
corner.
Twoscore
of
Aeron’s
drowned
men
there
awaited
him,
camped
along
a
grey
sand
beach
in
sealskin
tents
and
shelters
built
of
driftwood.
Their
hands
were
roughened
by
brine,
scarred
by
nets
and
lines,
callused
from
oars
and
picks
and
axes,
but
now
those
hands
gripped
driftwood
cudgels
hard
as
iron,
for
the
god
had
armed
them
from
his
arsenal
beneath
the
sea.

They
had
built
a
shelter
for
the
priest
just
above
the
tideline.
Gladly
he
crawled
into
it,
after
he
had
drowned
his
newest
followers.
My
god,
he
prayed,
speak
to
me
in
the
rumble
of
the
waves,
and
tell
me
what
to
do.
The
captains
and
the
kings
await
your
word.
Who
shall
be
our
king
in
Balon’s
place?
Sing
to
me
in
the
language
of
leviathan,
that
I
may
know
his
name.
Tell
me,
O
Lord
beneath
the
waves,
who
has
the
strength
to
fight
the
storm
on
Pyke?

Though
his
ride
to
Hammerhorn
had
left
him
weary,
Aeron
Damphair
was
restless
in
his
driftwood
shelter,
roofed
over
with
black
weeds
from
the
sea.
The
clouds
rolled
in
to
cloak
the
moon
and
stars,
and
the
darkness
lay
as
thick
upon
the
sea
as
it
did
upon
his
soul.
Balon
favored
Asha,
the
child
of
his
body,
but
a
woman
cannot
rule
the
ironborn.
It
must
be
Victarion.
Nine
sons
had
been
born
from
the
loins
of
Quellon
Greyjoy,
and
Victarion
was
the
strongest
of
them,
a
bull
of
a
man,
fearless
and
dutiful.
And
therein
lies
our
danger.
A
younger
brother
owes
obedience
to
an
elder,
and
Victarion
was
not
a
man
to
sail
against
tradition.
He
has
no
love
for
Euron,
though.
Not
since
the
woman
died.

Outside,
beneath
the
snoring
of
his
drowned
men
and
the
keening
of
the
wind,
he
could
hear
the
pounding
of
the
waves,
the
hammer
of
his
god
calling
him
to
battle.
Aeron
crept
from
his
little
shelter
into
the
chill
of
the
night.
Naked
he
stood,
pale
and
gaunt
and
tall,
and
naked
he
walked
into
the
black
salt
sea.
The
water
was
icy
cold,
yet
he
did
not
flinch
from
his
god’s
caress.
A
wave
smashed
against
his
chest,
staggering
him.
The
next
broke
over
his
head.
He
could
taste
the
salt
on
his
lips
and
feel
the
god
around
him,
and
his
ears
rang
with
the
glory
of
his
song.
Nine
sons
were
born
from
the
loins
of
Quellon
Greyjoy,
and
I
was
the
least
of
them,
as
weak
and
frightened
as
a
girl.
But
no
longer.
That
man
is
drowned,
and
the
god
has
made
me
strong.
The
cold
salt
sea
surrounded
him,
embraced
him,
reached
down
through
his
weak
man’s
flesh
and
touched
his
bones.
Bones,
he
thought.
The
bones
of
the
soul.
Balon’s
bones,
and
Urri’s.
The
truth
is
in
our
bones,
for
flesh
decays
and
bone
endures.
And
on
the
hill
of
Nagga,
the
bones
of
the
Grey
King’s
Hall...

And
gaunt
and
pale
and
shivering,
Aeron
Damphair
struggled
back
to
the
shore,
a
wiser
man
than
he
had
been
when
he
stepped
into
the
sea.
For
he
had
found
the
answer
in
his
bones,
and
the
way
was
plain
before
him.
The
night
was
so
cold
that
his
body
seemed
to
steam
as
he
stalked
back
toward
his
shelter,
but
there
was
a
fire
burning
in
his
heart,
and
sleep
came
easily
for
once,
unbroken
by
the
scream
of
iron
hinges.

When
he
woke
the
day
was
bright
and
windy.
Aeron
broke
his
fast
on
a
broth
of
clams
and
seaweed
cooked
above
a
driftwood
fire.
No
sooner
had
he
finished
than
the
Merlyn
descended
from
his
towerhouse
with
half
a
dozen
guards
to
seek
him
out.
“The
king
is
dead,”
the
Damphair
told
him.

“Aye.
I
had
a
bird.
And
now
another.”
The
Merlyn
was
a
bald
round
fleshy
man
who
styled
himself
“Lord”
in
the
manner
of
the
green
lands,
and
dressed
in
furs
and
velvets.
“One
raven
summons
me
to
Pyke,
another
to
Ten
Towers.
You
krakens
have
too
many
arms,
you
pull
a
man
to
pieces.
What
say
you,
priest?
Where
should
I
send
my
longships?”

Aeron
scowled.
“Ten
Towers,
do
you
say?
What
kraken
calls
you
there?”
Ten
Towers
was
the
seat
of
the
Lord
of
Harlaw.

“The
Princess
Asha.
She
has
set
her
sails
for
home.
The
Reader
sends
out
ravens,
summoning
all
her
friends
to
Harlaw.
He
says
that
Balon
meant
for
her
to
sit
the
Seastone
Chair.”

“The
Drowned
God
shall
decide
who
sits
the
Seastone
Chair,”
the
priest
said.
“Kneel,
that
I
might
bless
you.”
Lord
Merlyn
sank
to
his
knees,
and
Aeron
uncorked
his
skin
and
poured
a
stream
of
seawater
on
his
bald
pate.
“Lord
God
who
drowned
for
us,
let
Meldred
your
servant
be
born
again
from
the
sea.
Bless
him
with
salt,
bless
him
with
stone,
bless
him
with
steel.”
Water
ran
down
Merlyn’s
fat
cheeks
to
soak
his
beard
and
fox-fur
mantle.
“What
is
dead
may
never
die,”
Aeron
finished,
“but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger.”
But
when
Merlyn
rose,
he
told
him,
“Stay
and
listen,
that
you
may
spread
god’s
word.”

Three
feet
from
the
water’s
edge
the
waves
broke
around
a
rounded
granite
boulder.
It
was
there
that
Aeron
Damphair
stood,
so
all
his
school
might
see
him,
and
hear
the
words
he
had
to
say.

“We
were
born
from
the
sea,
and
to
the
sea
we
all
return,”
he
began,
as
he
had
a
hundred
times
before.
“The
Storm
God
in
his
wrath
plucked
Balon
from
his
castle
and
cast
him
down,
and
now
he
feasts
beneath
the
waves.”
He
raised
his
hands.
“The
iron
king
is
dead!
Yet
a
king
will
come
again!
For
what
is
dead
may
never
die,
but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger!”

“A
king
shall
rise!”
the
drowned
men
cried.

“He
shall.
He
must.
But
who?”
The
Damphair
listened
a
moment,
but
only
the
waves
gave
answer.
“Who
shall
be
our
king?”

The
drowned
men
began
to
slam
their
driftwood
cudgels
one
against
the
other.
“Damphair!”
they
cried.
“Damphair
King!
Aeron
King!
Give
us
Damphair!”

Aeron
shook
his
head.
“If
a
father
has
two
sons
and
gives
to
one
an
axe
and
to
the
other
a
net,
which
does
he
intend
should
be
the
warrior?”

“The
axe
is
for
the
warrior,”
Rus
shouted
back,
“the
net
for
a
fisher
of
the
seas.”

“Aye,”
said
Aeron.
“The
god
took
me
deep
beneath
the
waves
and
drowned
the
worthless
thing
I
was.
When
he
cast
me
forth
again
he
gave
me
eyes
to
see,
ears
to
hear,
and
a
voice
to
spread
his
word,
that
I
might
be
his
prophet
and
teach
his
truth
to
those
who
have
forgotten.
I
was
not
made
to
sit
upon
the
Seastone
Chair...
no
more
than
Euron
Crow’s
Eye.
For
I
have
heard
the
god,
who
says,
No
godless
man
may
sit
my
Seastone
Chair!”

The
Merlyn
crossed
his
arms
against
his
chest.
“Is
it
Asha,
then?
Or
Victarion?
Tell
us,
priest!”

“The
Drowned
God
will
tell
you,
but
not
here.”
Aeron
pointed
at
the
Merlyn’s
fat
white
face.
“Look
not
to
me,
nor
to
the
laws
of
men,
but
to
the
sea.
Raise
your
sails
and
unship
your
oars,
my
lord,
and
take
yourself
to
Old
Wyk.
You,
and
all
the
captains
and
the
kings.
Go
not
to
Pyke,
to
bow
before
the
godless,
nor
to
Harlaw,
to
consort
with
scheming
women.
Point
your
prow
toward
Old
Wyk,
where
stood
the
Grey
King’s
Hall.
In
the
name
of
the
Drowned
God
I
summon
you.
I
summon
all
of
you!
Leave
your
halls
and
hovels,
your
castles
and
your
keeps,
and
return
to
Nagga’s
hill
to
make
a
kingsmoot!”

The
Merlyn
gaped
at
him.
“A
kingsmoot?
There
has
not
been
a
true
kingsmoot
in...”

“...too
long
a
time!”
Aeron
cried
in
anguish.
“Yet
in
the
dawn
of
days
the
ironborn
chose
their
own
kings,
raising
up
the
worthiest
amongst
them.
It
is
time
we
returned
to
the
Old
Way,
for
only
that
shall
make
us
great
again.
It
was
a
kingsmoot
that
chose
Urras
Ironfoot
for
High
King,
and
placed
a
driftwood
crown
upon
his
brows.
Sylas
Flatnose,
Harrag
Hoare,
the
Old
Kraken,
the
kingsmoot
raised
them
all.
And
from
this
kingsmoot
shall
emerge
a
man
to
finish
the
work
King
Balon
has
begun
and
win
us
back
our
freedoms.
Go
not
to
Pyke,
nor
to
the
Ten
Towers
of
Harlaw,
but
to
Old
Wyk,
I
say
again.
Seek
the
hill
of
Nagga
and
the
bones
of
the
Grey
King’s
Hall,
for
in
that
holy
place
when
the
moon
has
drowned
and
come
again
we
shall
make
ourselves
a
worthy
king,
a
godly
king.”
He
raised
his
bony
hands
on
high
again.
“Listen!
Listen
to
the
waves!
Listen
to
the
god!
He
is
speaking
to
us,
and
he
says,
We
shall
have
no
king
but
from
the
kingsmoot!”

A
roar
went
up
at
that,
and
the
drowned
men
beat
their
cudgels
one
against
the
other.
“A
kingsmoot!”
they
shouted.
“A
kingsmoot,
a
kingsmoot.
No
king
but
from
the
kingsmoot!”
And
the
clamor
that
they
made
was
so
thunderous
that
surely
the
Crow’s
Eye
heard
the
shouts
on
Pyke,
and
the
vile
Storm
God
in
his
cloudy
hall.
And
Aeron
Damphair
knew
he
had
done
well.





THE
CAPTAIN
OF
GUARDS

“The
blood
oranges
are
well
past
ripe,”
the
prince
observed
in
a
weary
voice,
when
the
captain
rolled
him
onto
the
terrace.

After
that
he
did
not
speak
again
for
hours.

It
was
true
about
the
oranges.
A
few
had
fallen
to
burst
open
on
the
pale
pink
marble.
The
sharp
sweet
smell
of
them
filled
Hotah’s
nostrils
each
time
he
took
a
breath.
No
doubt
the
prince
could
smell
them
too,
as
he
sat
beneath
the
trees
in
the
rolling
chair
Maester
Caleotte
had
made
for
him,
with
its
goose-down
cushions
and
rumbling
wheels
of
ebony
and
iron.

For
a
long
while
the
only
sounds
were
the
children
splashing
in
the
pools
and
fountains,
and
once
a
soft
plop
as
another
orange
dropped
onto
the
terrace
to
burst.
Then,
from
the
far
side
of
the
palace,
the
captain
heard
the
faint
drumbeat
of
boots
on
marble.

Obara.
He
knew
her
stride;
long-legged,
hasty,
angry.
In
the
stables
by
the
gates,
her
horse
would
be
lathered,
and
bloody
from
her
spurs.
She
always
rode
stallions,
and
had
been
heard
to
boast
that
she
could
master
any
horse
in
Dorne...
and
any
man
as
well.
The
captain
could
hear
other
footsteps
as
well,
the
quick
soft
scuffing
of
Maester
Caleotte
hurrying
to
keep
up.

Obara
Sand
always
walked
too
fast.
She
is
chasing
after
something
she
can
never
catch,
the
prince
had
told
his
daughter
once,
in
the
captain’s
hearing.

When
she
appeared
beneath
the
triple
arch,
Areo
Hotah
swung
his
longaxe
sideways
to
block
the
way.
The
head
was
on
a
shaft
of
mountain
ash
six
feet
long,
so
she
could
not
go
around.
“My
lady,
no
farther.”
His
voice
was
a
bass
grumble
thick
with
the
accents
of
Norvos.
“The
prince
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed.”

Her
face
had
been
stone
before
he
spoke;
then
it
hardened.
“You
are
in
my
way,
Hotah.”
Obara
was
the
eldest
Sand
Snake,
a
big-boned
woman
near
to
thirty,
with
the
close-set
eyes
and
rat-brown
hair
of
the
Oldtown
whore
who’d
birthed
her.
Beneath
a
mottled
sandsilk
cloak
of
dun
and
gold,
her
riding
clothes
were
old
brown
leather,
worn
and
supple.
They
were
the
softest
things
about
her.
On
one
hip
she
wore
a
coiled
whip,
across
her
back
a
round
shield
of
steel
and
copper.
She
had
left
her
spear
outside.
For
that,
Areo
Hotah
gave
thanks.
Quick
and
strong
as
she
was,
the
woman
was
no
match
for
him,
he
knew...
but
she
did
not,
and
he
had
no
wish
to
see
her
blood
upon
the
pale
pink
marble.

Maester
Caleotte
shifted
his
weight
from
foot
to
foot.
“Lady
Obara,
I
tried
to
tell
you...”

“Does
he
know
that
my
father
is
dead?”
Obara
asked
the
captain,
paying
the
maester
no
more
mind
than
she
would
a
fly,
if
any
fly
had
been
foolish
enough
to
buzz
about
her
head.

“He
does,”
the
captain
said.
“He
had
a
bird.”

Death
had
come
to
Dorne
on
raven
wings,
writ
small
and
sealed
with
a
blob
of
hard
red
wax.
Caleotte
must
have
sensed
what
was
in
that
letter,
for
he’d
given
it
Hotah
to
deliver.
The
prince
thanked
him,
but
for
the
longest
time
he
would
not
break
the
seal.
All
afternoon
he’d
sat
with
the
parchment
in
his
lap,
watching
the
children
at
their
play.
He
watched
until
the
sun
went
down
and
the
evening
air
grew
cool
enough
to
drive
them
inside;
then
he
watched
the
starlight
on
the
water.
It
was
moonrise
before
he
sent
Hotah
to
fetch
a
candle,
so
he
might
read
his
letter
beneath
the
orange
trees
in
the
dark
of
night.

Obara
touched
her
whip.
“Thousands
are
crossing
the
sands
afoot
to
climb
the
Boneway,
so
they
may
help
Ellaria
bring
my
father
home.
The
septs
are
packed
to
bursting,
and
the
red
priests
have
lit
their
temple
fires.
In
the
pillow
houses
women
are
coupling
with
every
man
who
comes
to
them,
and
refusing
any
coin.
In
Sunspear,
on
the
Broken
Arm,
along
the
Greenblood,
in
the
mountains,
out
in
the
deep
sand,
everywhere,
everywhere,
women
tear
their
hair
and
men
cry
out
in
rage.
The
same
question
is
heard
on
every
tongue—what
will
Doran
do?
What
will
his
brother
do
to
avenge
our
murdered
prince?”
She
moved
closer
to
the
captain.
“And
you
say,
he
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed!”

“He
does
not
wish
to
be
disturbed,”
Areo
Hotah
said
again.

The
captain
of
guards
knew
the
prince
he
guarded.
Once,
long
ago,
a
callow
youth
had
come
from
Norvos,
a
big
broad-shouldered
boy
with
a
mop
of
dark
hair.
That
hair
was
white
now,
and
his
body
bore
the
scars
of
many
battles...
but
his
strength
remained,
and
he
kept
his
longaxe
sharp,
as
the
bearded
priests
had
taught
him.
She
shall
not
pass,
he
told
himself,
and
said,
“The
prince
is
watching
the
children
at
their
play.
He
is
never
to
be
disturbed
when
he
is
watching
the
children
at
their
play.”

“Hotah,”
said
Obara
Sand,
“you
will
remove
yourself
from
my
path,
else
I
shall
take
that
longaxe
and—”

“Captain,”
came
the
command,
from
behind.
“Let
her
pass.
I
will
speak
with
her.”
The
prince’s
voice
was
hoarse.

Areo
Hotah
jerked
his
longaxe
upright
and
stepped
to
one
side.
Obara
gave
him
a
lingering
last
look
and
strode
past,
the
maester
hurrying
at
her
heels.
Caleotte
was
no
more
than
five
feet
tall
and
bald
as
an
egg.
His
face
was
so
smooth
and
fat
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
his
age,
but
he
had
been
here
before
the
captain,
had
even
served
the
prince’s
mother.
Despite
his
age
and
girth,
he
was
still
nimble
enough,
and
clever
as
they
came,
but
meek.
He
is
no
match
for
any
Sand
Snake,
the
captain
thought.

In
the
shade
of
the
orange
trees,
the
prince
sat
in
his
chair
with
his
gouty
legs
propped
up
before
him,
and
heavy
bags
beneath
his
eyes...
though
whether
it
was
grief
or
gout
that
kept
him
sleepless,
Hotah
could
not
say.
Below,
in
the
fountains
and
the
pools,
the
children
were
still
at
their
play.
The
youngest
were
no
more
than
five,
the
oldest
nine
and
ten.
Half
were
girls
and
half
were
boys.
Hotah
could
hear
them
splashing
and
shouting
at
each
other
in
high,
shrill
voices.
“It
was
not
so
long
ago
that
you
were
one
of
the
children
in
those
pools,
Obara,”
the
prince
said,
when
she
took
one
knee
before
his
rolling
chair.

She
snorted.
“It
has
been
twenty
years,
or
near
enough
to
make
no
matter.
And
I
was
not
here
long.
I
am
the
whore’s
whelp,
or
had
you
forgotten?”
When
he
did
not
answer,
she
rose
again
and
put
her
hands
upon
her
hips.
“My
father
has
been
murdered.”

“He
was
slain
in
single
combat
during
a
trial
by
battle,”
Prince
Doran
said.
“By
law,
that
is
no
murder.”

“He
was
your
brother.”

“He
was.”

“What
do
you
mean
to
do
about
his
death?”

The
prince
turned
his
chair
laboriously
to
face
her.
Though
he
was
but
two-and-fifty,
Doran
Martell
seemed
much
older.
His
body
was
soft
and
shapeless
beneath
his
linen
robes,
and
his
legs
were
hard
to
look
upon.
The
gout
had
swollen
and
reddened
his
joints
grotesquely;
his
left
knee
was
an
apple,
his
right
a
melon,
and
his
toes
had
turned
to
dark
red
grapes,
so
ripe
it
seemed
as
though
a
touch
would
burst
them.
Even
the
weight
of
a
coverlet
could
make
him
shudder,
though
he
bore
the
pain
without
complaint.
Silence
is
a
prince’s
friend,
the
captain
had
heard
him
tell
his
daughter
once.
Words
are
like
arrows,
Arianne.
Once
loosed,
you
cannot
call
them
back.
“I
have
written
to
Lord
Tywin—”

“Written?
If
you
were
half
the
man
my
father
was—”

“I
am
not
your
father.”

“That
I
knew.”
Obara’s
voice
was
thick
with
contempt.

“You
would
have
me
go
to
war.”

“I
know
better.
You
need
not
even
leave
your
chair.
Let
me
avenge
my
father.
You
have
a
host
in
the
Prince’s
Pass.
Lord
Yronwood
has
another
in
the
Boneway.
Grant
me
the
one
and
Nym
the
other.
Let
her
ride
the
kingsroad,
whilst
I
turn
the
marcher
lords
out
of
their
castles
and
hook
round
to
march
on
Oldtown.”

“And
how
could
you
hope
to
hold
Oldtown?”

“It
will
be
enough
to
sack
it.
The
wealth
of
Hightower—”

“Is
it
gold
you
want?”

“It
is
blood
I
want.”

“Lord
Tywin
shall
deliver
us
the
Mountain’s
head.”

“And
who
will
deliver
us
Lord
Tywin’s
head?
The
Mountain
has
always
been
his
pet.”

The
prince
gestured
toward
the
pools.
“Obara,
look
at
the
children,
if
it
please
you.”

“It
does
not
please
me.
I’d
get
more
pleasure
from
driving
my
spear
into
Lord
Tywin’s
belly.
I’ll
make
him
sing
‘The
Rains
of
Castamere’
as
I
pull
his
bowels
out
and
look
for
gold.”

“Look,”
the
prince
repeated.
“I
command
you.”

A
few
of
the
older
children
lay
facedown
upon
the
smooth
pink
marble,
browning
in
the
sun.
Others
paddled
in
the
sea
beyond.
Three
were
building
a
sand
castle
with
a
great
spike
that
resembled
the
Spear
Tower
of
the
Old
Palace.
A
score
or
more
had
gathered
in
the
big
pool,
to
watch
the
battles
as
smaller
children
rode
through
the
waist-deep
shallows
on
the
shoulders
of
the
larger
and
tried
to
shove
each
other
into
the
water.
Every
time
a
pair
went
down,
the
splash
was
followed
by
a
roar
of
laughter.
They
watched
a
nut-brown
girl
yank
a
towheaded
boy
off
his
brother’s
shoulders
to
tumble
him
headfirst
into
the
pool.

“Your
father
played
that
same
game
once,
as
I
did
before
him,”
said
the
prince.
“We
had
ten
years
between
us,
so
I
had
left
the
pools
by
the
time
he
was
old
enough
to
play,
but
I
would
watch
him
when
I
came
to
visit
Mother.
He
was
so
fierce,
even
as
a
boy.
Quick
as
a
water
snake.
I
oft
saw
him
topple
boys
much
bigger
than
himself.
He
reminded
me
of
that
the
day
he
left
for
King’s
Landing.
He
swore
that
he
would
do
it
one
more
time,
else
I
would
never
have
let
him
go.”

“Let
him
go?”
Obara
laughed.
“As
if
you
could
have
stopped
him.
The
Red
Viper
of
Dorne
went
where
he
would.”

“He
did.
I
wish
I
had
some
word
of
comfort
to—”

“I
did
not
come
to
you
for
comfort.”
Her
voice
was
full
of
scorn.
“The
day
my
father
came
to
claim
me,
my
mother
did
not
wish
for
me
to
go.
‘She
is
a
girl,’
she
said,
‘and
I
do
not
think
that
she
is
yours.
I
had
a
thousand
other
men.’
He
tossed
his
spear
at
my
feet
and
gave
my
mother
the
back
of
his
hand
across
the
face,
so
she
began
to
weep.
‘Girl
or
boy,
we
fight
our
battles,’
he
said,
‘but
the
gods
let
us
choose
our
weapons.’
He
pointed
to
the
spear,
then
to
my
mother’s
tears,
and
I
picked
up
the
spear.
‘I
told
you
she
was
mine,’
my
father
said,
and
took
me.
My
mother
drank
herself
to
death
within
the
year.
They
say
that
she
was
weeping
as
she
died.”
Obara
edged
closer
to
the
prince
in
his
chair.
“Let
me
use
the
spear;
I
ask
no
more.”

“It
is
a
deal
to
ask,
Obara.
I
shall
sleep
on
it.”

“You
have
slept
too
long
already.”

“You
may
be
right.
I
will
send
word
to
you
at
Sunspear.”

“So
long
as
the
word
is
war.”
Obara
turned
upon
her
heel
and
strode
off
as
angrily
as
she
had
come,
back
to
the
stables
for
a
fresh
horse
and
another
headlong
gallop
down
the
road.

Maester
Caleotte
remained
behind.
“My
prince?”
the
little
round
man
asked.
“Do
your
legs
hurt?”

The
prince
smiled
faintly.
“Is
the
sun
hot?”

“Shall
I
fetch
a
draught
for
the
pain?”

“No.
I
need
my
wits
about
me.”

The
maester
hesitated.
“My
prince,
is
it...
is
it
prudent
to
allow
Lady
Obara
to
return
to
Sunspear?
She
is
certain
to
inflame
the
common
people.
They
loved
your
brother
well.”

“So
did
we
all.”
He
pressed
his
fingers
to
his
temples.
“No.
You
are
right.
I
must
return
to
Sunspear
as
well.”

The
little
round
man
hesitated.
“Is
that
wise?”

“Not
wise,
but
necessary.
Best
send
a
rider
to
Ricasso,
and
have
him
open
my
apartments
in
the
Tower
of
the
Sun.
Inform
my
daughter
Arianne
that
I
will
be
there
on
the
morrow.”

My
little
princess.
The
captain
had
missed
her
sorely.

“You
will
be
seen,”
the
maester
warned.

The
captain
understood.
Two
years
ago,
when
they
had
left
Sunspear
for
the
peace
and
isolation
of
the
Water
Gardens,
Prince
Doran’s
gout
had
not
been
half
so
bad.
In
those
days
he
had
still
walked,
albeit
slowly,
leaning
on
a
stick
and
grimacing
with
every
step.
The
prince
did
not
wish
his
enemies
to
know
how
feeble
he
had
grown,
and
the
Old
Palace
and
its
shadow
city
were
full
of
eyes.
Eyes,
the
captain
thought,
and
steps
he
cannot
climb.
He
would
need
to
fly
to
sit
atop
the
Tower
of
the
Sun.

“I
must
be
seen.
Someone
must
pour
oil
on
the
waters.
Dorne
must
be
reminded
that
it
still
has
a
prince.”
He
smiled
wanly.
“Old
and
gouty
though
he
is.”

“If
you
return
to
Sunspear,
you
will
need
to
give
audience
to
Princess
Myrcella,”
Caleotte
said.
“Her
white
knight
will
be
with
her...
and
you
know
he
sends
letters
to
his
queen.”

“I
suppose
he
does.”

The
white
knight.
The
captain
frowned.
Ser
Arys
had
come
to
Dorne
to
attend
his
own
princess,
as
Areo
Hotah
had
once
come
with
his.
Even
their
names
sounded
oddly
alike:
Areo
and
Arys.
Yet
there
the
likeness
ended.
The
captain
had
left
Norvos
and
its
bearded
priests,
but
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
still
served
the
Iron
Throne.
Hotah
had
felt
a
certain
sadness
whenever
he
saw
the
man
in
the
long
snowy
cloak,
the
times
the
prince
had
sent
him
down
to
Sunspear.
One
day,
he
sensed,
the
two
of
them
would
fight;
on
that
day
Oakheart
would
die,
with
the
captain’s
longaxe
crashing
through
his
skull.
He
slid
his
hand
along
the
smooth
ashen
shaft
of
his
axe
and
wondered
if
that
day
was
drawing
nigh.

“The
afternoon
is
almost
done,”
the
prince
was
saying.
“We
will
wait
for
morn.
See
that
my
litter
is
ready
by
first
light.”

“As
you
command.”
Caleotte
bobbed
a
bow.
The
captain
stood
aside
to
let
him
pass,
and
listened
to
his
footsteps
dwindle.

“Captain?”
The
prince’s
voice
was
soft.

Hotah
strode
forward,
one
hand
wrapped
about
his
longaxe.
The
ash
felt
as
smooth
as
a
woman’s
skin
against
his
palm.
When
he
reached
the
rolling
chair
he
thumped
its
butt
down
hard
to
announce
his
presence,
but
the
prince
had
eyes
only
for
the
children.
“Did
you
have
brothers,
captain?”
he
asked.
“Back
in
Norvos,
when
you
were
young?
Sisters?”

“Both,”
Hotah
said.
“Two
brothers,
three
sisters.
I
was
the
youngest.”
The
youngest,
and
unwanted.
Another
mouth
to
feed,
a
big
boy
who
ate
too
much
and
soon
outgrew
his
clothes.
Small
wonder
they
had
sold
him
to
the
bearded
priests.

“I
was
the
oldest,”
the
prince
said,
“and
yet
I
am
the
last.
After
Mors
and
Olyvar
died
in
their
cradles,
I
gave
up
hope
of
brothers.
I
was
nine
when
Elia
came,
a
squire
in
service
at
Salt
Shore.
When
the
raven
arrived
with
word
that
my
mother
had
been
brought
to
bed
a
month
too
soon,
I
was
old
enough
to
understand
that
meant
the
child
would
not
live.
Even
when
Lord
Gargalen
told
me
that
I
had
a
sister,
I
assured
him
that
she
must
shortly
die.
Yet
she
lived,
by
the
Mother’s
mercy.
And
a
year
later
Oberyn
arrived,
squalling
and
kicking.
I
was
a
man
grown
when
they
were
playing
in
these
pools.
Yet
here
I
sit,
and
they
are
gone.”

Areo
Hotah
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that.
He
was
only
a
captain
of
guards,
and
still
a
stranger
to
this
land
and
its
seven-faced
god,
even
after
all
these
years.
Serve.
Obey.
Protect.
He
had
sworn
those
vows
at
six-and-ten,
the
day
he
wed
his
axe.
Simple
vows
for
simple
men,
the
bearded
priests
had
said.
He
had
not
been
trained
to
counsel
grieving
princes.

He
was
still
groping
for
some
words
to
say
when
another
orange
fell
with
a
heavy
splat,
no
more
than
a
foot
from
where
the
prince
was
seated.
Doran
winced
at
the
sound,
as
if
somehow
it
had
hurt
him.
“Enough,”
he
sighed,
“it
is
enough.
Leave
me,
Areo.
Let
me
watch
the
children
for
a
few
more
hours.”

When
the
sun
set
the
air
grew
cool
and
the
children
went
inside
in
search
of
supper,
still
the
prince
remained
beneath
his
orange
trees,
looking
out
over
the
still
pools
and
the
sea
beyond.
A
serving
man
brought
him
a
bowl
of
purple
olives,
with
flatbread,
cheese,
and
chickpea
paste.
He
ate
a
bit
of
it,
and
drank
a
cup
of
the
sweet,
heavy
strongwine
that
he
loved.
When
it
was
empty,
he
filled
it
once
again.
Sometimes
in
the
deep
black
hours
of
the
morning
sleep
found
him
in
his
chair.
Only
then
did
the
captain
roll
him
down
the
moonlit
gallery,
past
a
row
of
fluted
pillars
and
through
a
graceful
archway,
to
a
great
bed
with
crisp
cool
linen
sheets
in
a
chamber
by
the
sea.
Doran
groaned
as
the
captain
moved
him,
but
the
gods
were
good
and
he
did
not
wake.

The
captain’s
sleeping
cell
adjoined
his
prince’s.
He
sat
upon
the
narrow
bed
and
found
his
whetstone
and
oilcloth
in
their
niche,
and
set
to
work.
Keep
your
longaxe
sharp,
the
bearded
priests
had
told
him,
the
day
they
branded
him.
He
always
did.

As
he
honed
the
axe,
Hotah
thought
of
Norvos,
the
high
city
on
the
hill
and
the
low
beside
the
river.
He
could
still
recall
the
sounds
of
the
three
bells,
the
way
that
Noom’s
deep
peals
set
his
very
bones
to
shuddering,
the
proud
strong
voice
of
Narrah,
sweet
Nyel’s
silvery
laughter.
The
taste
of
wintercake
filled
his
mouth
again,
rich
with
ginger
and
pine
nuts
and
bits
of
cherry,
with
nahsa
to
wash
it
down,
fermented
goat’s
milk
served
in
an
iron
cup
and
laced
with
honey.
He
saw
his
mother
in
her
dress
with
the
squirrel
collar,
the
one
she
wore
but
once
each
year,
when
they
went
to
see
the
bears
dance
down
the
Sinner’s
Steps.
And
he
smelled
the
stench
of
burning
hair
as
the
bearded
priest
touched
the
brand
to
the
center
of
his
chest.
The
pain
had
been
so
fierce
that
he
thought
his
heart
might
stop,
yet
Areo
Hotah
had
not
flinched.
The
hair
had
never
grown
back
over
the
axe.

Only
when
both
edges
were
sharp
enough
to
shave
with
did
the
captain
lay
his
ash-and-iron
wife
down
on
the
bed.
Yawning,
he
pulled
off
his
soiled
clothes,
tossed
them
on
the
floor,
and
stretched
out
on
his
straw-stuffed
mattress.
Thinking
of
the
brand
had
made
it
itch,
so
he
had
to
scratch
himself
before
he
closed
his
eyes.
I
should
have
gathered
up
the
oranges
that
fell,
he
thought,
and
went
to
sleep
dreaming
of
the
tart
sweet
taste
of
them,
and
the
sticky
feel
of
the
red
juice
on
his
fingers.

Dawn
came
too
soon.
Outside
the
stables
the
smallest
of
the
three
horse
litters
stood
ready,
the
cedarwood
litter
with
the
red
silk
draperies.
The
captain
chose
twenty
spears
to
accompany
it,
out
of
the
thirty
who
were
posted
at
the
Water
Gardens;
the
rest
would
stay
to
guard
the
grounds
and
children,
some
of
whom
were
the
sons
and
daughters
of
great
lords
and
wealthy
merchants.

Although
the
prince
had
spoken
of
departing
at
first
light,
Areo
Hotah
knew
that
he
would
dawdle.
Whilst
the
maester
helped
Doran
Martell
to
bathe
and
bandaged
up
his
swollen
joints
in
linen
wraps
soaked
with
soothing
lotions,
the
captain
donned
a
shirt
of
copper
scales
as
befit
his
rank,
and
a
billowing
cloak
of
dun-and-yellow
sandsilk
to
keep
the
sun
off
the
copper.
The
day
promised
to
be
hot,
and
the
captain
had
long
ago
discarded
the
heavy
horsehair
cape
and
studded
leather
tunic
he
had
worn
in
Norvos,
which
were
like
to
cook
a
man
in
Dorne.
He
had
kept
his
iron
halfhelm,
with
its
crest
of
sharpened
spikes,
but
now
he
wore
it
wrapped
in
orange
silk,
weaving
the
cloth
in
and
around
the
spikes.
Elsewise
the
sun
beating
down
on
the
metal
would
have
his
head
pounding
before
they
saw
the
palace.

The
prince
was
still
not
ready
to
depart.
He
had
decided
to
break
his
fast
before
he
went,
with
a
blood
orange
and
a
plate
of
gull’s
eggs
diced
with
bits
of
ham
and
fiery
peppers.
Then
nought
would
do
but
he
must
say
farewell
to
several
of
the
children
who
had
become
especial
favorites:
the
Dalt
boy
and
Lady
Blackmont’s
brood
and
the
round-faced
orphan
girl
whose
father
had
sold
cloth
and
spices
up
and
down
the
Greenblood.
Doran
kept
a
splendid
Myrish
blanket
over
his
legs
as
he
spoke
with
them,
to
spare
the
young
ones
the
sight
of
his
swollen,
bandaged
joints.

It
was
midday
before
they
got
under
way;
the
prince
in
his
litter,
Maester
Caleotte
riding
on
a
donkey,
the
rest
afoot.
Five
spearmen
walked
ahead
and
five
behind,
with
five
more
flanking
the
litter
to
either
side.
Areo
Hotah
himself
took
his
familiar
place
at
the
left
hand
of
the
prince,
resting
his
longaxe
on
a
shoulder
as
he
walked.
The
road
from
Sunspear
to
the
Water
Gardens
ran
beside
the
sea,
so
they
had
a
cool
fresh
breeze
to
soothe
them
as
they
made
their
way
across
a
sparse
red-brown
land
of
stone
and
sand
and
twisted
stunted
trees.

Halfway
there,
the
second
Sand
Snake
caught
them.

She
appeared
suddenly
upon
a
dune,
mounted
on
a
golden
sand
steed
with
a
mane
like
fine
white
silk.
Even
ahorse,
the
Lady
Nym
looked
graceful,
dressed
all
in
shimmering
lilac
robes
and
a
great
silk
cape
of
cream
and
copper
that
lifted
at
every
gust
of
wind,
and
made
her
look
as
if
she
might
take
flight.
Nymeria
Sand
was
five-and-twenty,
and
slender
as
a
willow.
Her
straight
black
hair,
worn
in
a
long
braid
bound
up
with
red-gold
wire,
made
a
widow’s
peak
above
her
dark
eyes,
just
as
her
father’s
had.
With
her
high
cheekbones,
full
lips,
and
milk-pale
skin,
she
had
all
the
beauty
that
her
elder
sister
lacked...
but
Obara’s
mother
had
been
an
Oldtown
whore,
whilst
Nym
was
born
from
the
noblest
blood
of
old
Volantis.
A
dozen
mounted
spearmen
tailed
her,
their
round
shields
gleaming
in
the
sun.
They
followed
her
down
the
dune.

The
prince
had
tied
back
the
curtains
on
his
litter,
the
better
to
enjoy
the
breeze
blowing
off
the
sea.
Lady
Nym
fell
in
beside
him,
slowing
her
pretty
golden
mare
to
match
the
litter’s
pace.
“Well
met,
Uncle,”
she
sang
out,
as
if
it
had
been
chance
that
brought
her
here.
“May
I
ride
with
you
to
Sunspear?”
The
captain
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
litter
from
Lady
Nym,
yet
he
could
hear
every
word
she
said.

“I
would
be
glad
of
it,”
Prince
Doran
replied,
though
he
did
not
sound
glad
to
the
captain’s
ears.
“Gout
and
grief
make
poor
companions
on
the
road.”
By
which
the
captain
knew
him
to
mean
that
every
pebble
drove
a
spike
through
his
swollen
joints.

“The
gout
I
cannot
help,”
she
said,
“but
my
father
had
no
use
for
grief.
Vengeance
was
more
to
his
taste.
Is
it
true
that
Gregor
Clegane
admitted
slaying
Elia
and
her
children?”

“He
roared
out
his
guilt
for
all
the
court
to
hear,”
the
prince
admitted.
“Lord
Tywin
has
promised
us
his
head.”

“And
a
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts,”
said
Lady
Nym,
“yet
it
seems
to
me
that
Lord
Tywin
means
to
pay
us
with
our
own
coin.
I
had
a
bird
from
our
sweet
Ser
Daemon,
who
swears
my
father
tickled
that
monster
more
than
once
as
they
fought.
If
so,
Ser
Gregor
is
as
good
as
dead,
and
no
thanks
to
Tywin
Lannister.”

The
prince
grimaced.
Whether
it
was
from
the
pain
of
gout
or
his
niece’s
words,
the
captain
could
not
say.
“It
may
be
so.”

“May
be?
I
say
’tis.”

“Obara
would
have
me
go
to
war.”

Nym
laughed.
“Yes,
she
wants
to
set
the
torch
to
Oldtown.
She
hates
that
city
as
much
as
our
little
sister
loves
it.”

“And
you?”

Nym
glanced
over
a
shoulder,
to
where
her
companions
rode
a
dozen
lengths
behind.
“I
was
abed
with
the
Fowler
twins
when
the
word
reached
me,”
the
captain
heard
her
say.
“You
know
the
Fowler
words?
Let
Me
Soar!
That
is
all
I
ask
of
you.
Let
me
soar,
Uncle.
I
need
no
mighty
host,
only
one
sweet
sister.”

“Obara?”

“Tyene.
Obara
is
too
loud.
Tyene
is
so
sweet
and
gentle
that
no
man
will
suspect
her.
Obara
would
make
Oldtown
our
father’s
funeral
pyre,
but
I
am
not
so
greedy.
Four
lives
will
suffice
for
me.
Lord
Tywin’s
golden
twins,
as
payment
for
Elia’s
children.
The
old
lion,
for
Elia
herself.
And
last
of
all
the
little
king,
for
my
father.”

“The
boy
has
never
wronged
us.”

“The
boy
is
a
bastard
born
of
treason,
incest,
and
adultery,
if
Lord
Stannis
can
be
believed.”
The
playful
tone
had
vanished
from
her
voice,
and
the
captain
found
himself
watching
her
through
narrowed
eyes.
Her
sister
Obara
wore
her
whip
upon
her
hip
and
carried
a
spear
where
any
man
could
see
it.
Lady
Nym
was
no
less
deadly,
though
she
kept
her
knives
well
hidden.
“Only
royal
blood
can
wash
out
my
father’s
murder.”

“Oberyn
died
during
single
combat,
fighting
in
a
matter
that
was
none
of
his
concern.
I
do
not
call
that
murder.”

“Call
it
what
you
will.
We
sent
them
the
finest
man
in
Dorne,
and
they
are
sending
back
a
bag
of
bones.”

“He
went
beyond
anything
I
asked
of
him.
‘Take
the
measure
of
this
boy
king
and
his
council,
and
make
note
of
their
strengths
and
weaknesses,’
I
told
him,
on
the
terrace.
We
were
eating
oranges.
‘Find
us
friends,
if
there
are
any
to
be
found.
Learn
what
you
can
of
Elia’s
end,
but
see
that
you
do
not
provoke
Lord
Tywin
unduly,’
those
were
my
words
to
him.
Oberyn
laughed,
and
said,
‘When
have
I
provoked
any
man...
unduly?
You
would
do
better
to
warn
the
Lannisters
against
provoking
me.’
He
wanted
justice
for
Elia,
but
he
would
not
wait—”

“He
waited
ten-and-seven
years,”
the
Lady
Nym
broke
in.
“Were
it
you
they’d
killed,
my
father
would
have
led
his
banners
north
before
your
corpse
was
cold.
Were
it
you,
the
spears
would
be
falling
thick
as
rain
upon
the
marches
now.”

“I
do
not
doubt
it.”

“No
more
should
you
doubt
this,
my
prince—my
sisters
and
I
shall
not
wait
ten-and-seven
years
for
our
vengeance.”
She
put
her
spurs
into
the
mare
and
she
was
off,
galloping
toward
Sunspear
with
her
tail
in
hot
pursuit.

The
prince
leaned
back
against
his
pillows
and
closed
his
eyes,
but
Hotah
knew
he
did
not
sleep.
He
is
in
pain.
For
a
moment
he
considered
calling
Maester
Caleotte
up
to
the
litter,
but
if
Prince
Doran
had
wanted
him,
he
would
have
called
himself.

The
shadows
of
the
afternoon
were
long
and
dark
and
the
sun
was
as
red
and
swollen
as
the
prince’s
joints
before
they
glimpsed
the
towers
of
Sunspear
to
the
east.
First
the
slender
Spear
Tower,
a
hundred-and-a-half
feet
tall
and
crowned
with
a
spear
of
gilded
steel
that
added
another
thirty
feet
to
its
height;
then
the
mighty
Tower
of
the
Sun,
with
its
dome
of
gold
and
leaded
glass;
last
the
dun-colored
Sandship,
looking
like
some
monstrous
dromond
that
had
washed
ashore
and
turned
to
stone.

Only
three
leagues
of
coast
road
divided
Sunspear
from
the
Water
Gardens,
yet
they
were
two
different
worlds.
There
children
frolicked
naked
in
the
sun,
music
played
in
tiled
courtyards,
and
the
air
was
sharp
with
the
smell
of
lemons
and
blood
oranges.
Here
the
air
smelled
of
dust,
sweat,
and
smoke,
and
the
nights
were
alive
with
the
babble
of
voices.
In
place
of
the
pink
marble
of
the
Water
Gardens,
Sunspear
was
built
from
mud
and
straw,
and
colored
brown
and
dun.
The
ancient
stronghold
of
House
Martell
stood
at
the
easternmost
end
of
a
little
jut
of
stone
and
sand,
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
the
sea.
To
the
west,
in
the
shadows
of
Sunspear’s
massive
walls,
mud-brick
shops
and
windowless
hovels
clung
to
the
castle
like
barnacles
to
a
galley’s
hull.
Stables
and
inns
and
winesinks
and
pillow
houses
had
grown
up
west
of
those,
many
enclosed
by
walls
of
their
own,
and
yet
more
hovels
had
risen
beneath
those
walls.
And
so
and
so
and
so,
as
the
bearded
priests
would
say.
Compared
to
Tyrosh
or
Myr
or
Great
Norvos,
the
shadow
city
was
no
more
than
a
town,
yet
it
was
the
nearest
thing
to
a
true
city
that
these
Dornish
had.

Lady
Nym’s
arrival
had
preceded
theirs
by
some
hours,
and
no
doubt
she
had
warned
the
guards
of
their
coming,
for
the
Threefold
Gate
was
open
when
they
reached
it.
Only
here
were
the
gates
lined
up
one
behind
the
other
to
allow
visitors
to
pass
beneath
all
three
of
the
Winding
Walls
directly
to
the
Old
Palace,
without
first
making
their
way
through
miles
of
narrow
alleys,
hidden
courts,
and
noisy
bazaars.

Prince
Doran
had
closed
the
draperies
of
his
litter
as
soon
as
the
Spear
Tower
came
in
sight,
yet
still
the
smallfolk
shouted
out
to
him
as
the
litter
passed.
The
Sand
Snakes
have
stirred
them
to
a
boil,
the
captain
thought
uneasily.
They
crossed
the
squalor
of
the
outer
crescent
and
went
through
the
second
gate.
Beyond,
the
wind
stank
of
tar
and
salt
water
and
rotting
seaweed,
and
the
crowd
grew
thicker
with
every
step.
“Make
way
for
Prince
Doran!”
Areo
Hotah
boomed
out,
thumping
the
butt
of
his
longaxe
on
the
bricks.
“Make
way
for
the
Prince
of
Dorne!”

“The
prince
is
dead!”
a
woman
shrilled
behind
him.

“To
spears!”
a
man
bellowed
from
a
balcony.

“Doran!”
called
some
highborn
voice.
“To
the
spears!”

Hotah
gave
up
looking
for
the
speakers;
the
press
was
too
thick,
and
a
third
of
them
were
shouting.
“To
spears!
Vengeance
for
the
Viper!”
By
the
time
they
reached
the
third
gate,
the
guards
were
shoving
people
aside
to
clear
a
path
for
the
prince’s
litter,
and
the
crowd
was
throwing
things.
One
ragged
boy
darted
past
the
spearmen
with
a
half-rotten
pomegranate
in
one
hand,
but
when
he
saw
Areo
Hotah
in
his
path,
with
longaxe
at
the
ready,
he
let
the
fruit
fall
unthrown
and
beat
a
quick
retreat.
Others
farther
back
let
fly
with
lemons,
limes,
and
oranges,
crying
“War!
War!
To
the
spears!”
One
of
the
guards
was
hit
in
the
eye
with
a
lemon,
and
the
captain
himself
had
an
orange
splatter
off
his
foot.

No
answer
came
from
within
the
litter.
Doran
Martell
stayed
cloaked
within
his
silken
walls
until
the
thicker
walls
of
the
castle
swallowed
all
of
them,
and
the
portcullis
came
down
behind
them
with
a
rattling
crunch.
The
sounds
of
shouting
dwindled
away
slowly.
Princess
Arianne
was
waiting
in
the
outer
ward
to
greet
her
father,
with
half
the
court
about
her:
the
old
blind
seneschal
Ricasso,
Ser
Manfrey
Martell
the
castellan,
young
Maester
Myles
with
his
grey
robes
and
silky
perfumed
beard,
twoscore
of
Dornish
knights
in
flowing
linen
of
half
a
hundred
hues.
Little
Myrcella
Baratheon
stood
with
her
septa
and
Ser
Arys
of
the
Kingsguard,
sweltering
in
his
white-enameled
scales.

Princess
Arianne
strode
to
the
litter
on
snakeskin
sandals
laced
up
to
her
thighs.
Her
hair
was
a
mane
of
jet-black
ringlets
that
fell
to
the
small
of
her
back,
and
around
her
brow
was
a
band
of
copper
suns.
She
is
still
a
little
thing,
the
captain
thought.
Where
the
Sand
Snakes
were
tall,
Arianne
took
after
her
mother,
who
stood
but
five
foot
two.
Yet
beneath
her
jeweled
girdle
and
loose
layers
of
flowing
purple
silk
and
yellow
samite
she
had
a
woman’s
body,
lush
and
roundly
curved.
“Father,”
she
announced
as
the
curtains
opened,
“Sunspear
rejoices
at
your
return.”

“Yes,
I
heard
the
joy.”
The
prince
smiled
wanly
and
cupped
his
daughter’s
cheek
with
a
reddened,
swollen
hand.
“You
look
well.
Captain,
be
so
good
as
to
help
me
down
from
here.”

Hotah
slid
his
longaxe
into
its
sling
across
his
back
and
gathered
the
prince
into
his
arms,
tenderly
so
as
not
to
jar
his
swollen
joints.
Even
so,
Doran
Martell
bit
back
a
gasp
of
pain.

“I
have
commanded
the
cooks
to
prepare
a
feast
for
this
evening,”
Arianne
said,
“with
all
your
favorite
dishes.”

“I
fear
I
could
not
do
them
justice.”
The
prince
glanced
slowly
around
the
yard.
“I
do
not
see
Tyene.”

“She
begs
a
private
word.
I
sent
her
to
the
throne
room
to
await
your
coming.”

The
prince
sighed.
“Very
well.
Captain?
The
sooner
I
am
done
with
this,
the
sooner
I
may
rest.”

Hotah
bore
him
up
the
long
stone
steps
of
the
Tower
of
the
Sun,
to
the
great
round
chamber
beneath
the
dome,
where
the
last
light
of
the
afternoon
was
slanting
down
through
thick
windows
of
many-colored
glass
to
dapple
the
pale
marble
with
diamonds
of
half
a
hundred
colors.
There
the
third
Sand
Snake
awaited
them.

She
was
sitting
cross-legged
on
a
pillow
beneath
the
raised
dais
where
the
high
seats
stood,
but
she
rose
as
they
entered,
dressed
in
a
clinging
gown
of
pale
blue
samite
with
sleeves
of
Myrish
lace
that
made
her
look
as
innocent
as
the
Maid
herself.
In
one
hand
was
a
piece
of
embroidery
she
had
been
working
on,
in
the
other
a
pair
of
golden
needles.
Her
hair
was
gold
as
well,
and
her
eyes
were
deep
blue
pools...
and
yet
somehow
they
reminded
the
captain
of
her
father’s
eyes,
though
Oberyn’s
had
been
as
black
as
night.
All
of
Prince
Oberyn’s
daughters
have
his
viper
eyes,
Hotah
realized
suddenly.
The
color
does
not
matter.

“Uncle,”
said
Tyene
Sand,
“I
have
been
waiting
for
you.”

“Captain,
help
me
to
the
high
seat.”

There
were
two
seats
on
the
dais,
near
twin
to
one
another,
save
that
one
had
the
Martell
spear
inlaid
in
gold
upon
its
back,
whilst
the
other
bore
the
blazing
Rhoynish
sun
that
had
flown
from
the
masts
of
Nymeria’s
ships
when
first
they
came
to
Dorne.
The
captain
placed
the
prince
beneath
the
spear
and
stepped
away.

“Does
it
hurt
so
much?”
Lady
Tyene’s
voice
was
gentle,
and
she
looked
as
sweet
as
summer
strawberries.
Her
mother
had
been
a
septa,
and
Tyene
had
an
air
of
almost
otherworldy
innocence
about
her.
“Is
there
aught
that
I
might
do
to
ease
your
pain?”

“Say
what
you
would
and
let
me
rest.
I
am
weary,
Tyene.”

“I
made
this
for
you,
Uncle.”
Tyene
unfolded
the
piece
she’d
been
embroidering.
It
showed
her
father,
Prince
Oberyn,
mounted
on
a
sand
steed
and
armored
all
in
red,
smiling.
“When
I
finish,
it
is
yours,
to
help
you
remember
him.”

“I
am
not
like
to
forget
your
father.”

“That
is
good
to
know.
Many
have
wondered.”

“Lord
Tywin
has
promised
us
the
Mountain’s
head.”

“He
is
so
kind...
but
a
headsman’s
sword
is
no
fit
end
for
brave
Ser
Gregor.
We
have
prayed
so
long
for
his
death,
it
is
only
fair
that
he
pray
for
it
as
well.
I
know
the
poison
that
my
father
used,
and
there
is
none
slower
or
more
agonizing.
Soon
we
may
hear
the
Mountain
screaming,
even
here
in
Sunspear.”

Prince
Doran
sighed.
“Obara
cries
to
me
for
war.
Nym
will
be
content
with
murder.
And
you?”

“War,”
said
Tyene,
“though
not
my
sister’s
war.
Dornishmen
fight
best
at
home,
so
I
say
let
us
hone
our
spears
and
wait.
When
the
Lannisters
and
the
Tyrells
come
down
on
us,
we
shall
bleed
them
in
the
passes
and
bury
them
beneath
the
blowing
sands,
as
we
have
a
hundred
times
before.”

“If
they
should
come
down
on
us.”

“Oh,
but
they
must,
or
see
the
realm
riven
once
more,
as
it
was
before
we
wed
the
dragons.
Father
told
me
so.
He
said
we
had
the
Imp
to
thank,
for
sending
us
Princess
Myrcella.
She
is
so
pretty,
don’t
you
think?
I
wish
that
I
had
curls
like
hers.
She
was
made
to
be
a
queen,
just
like
her
mother.”
Dimples
bloomed
in
Tyene’s
cheeks.
“I
would
be
honored
to
arrange
the
wedding,
and
to
see
to
the
making
of
the
crowns
as
well.
Trystane
and
Myrcella
are
so
innocent,
I
thought
perhaps
white
gold...
with
emeralds,
to
match
Myrcella’s
eyes.
Oh,
diamonds
and
pearls
would
serve
as
well,
so
long
as
the
children
are
wed
and
crowned.
Then
we
need
only
hail
Myrcella
as
the
First
of
Her
Name,
Queen
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
lawful
heir
to
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
Westeros,
and
wait
for
the
lions
to
come.”

“The
lawful
heir?”
The
prince
snorted.

“She
is
older
than
her
brother,”
explained
Tyene,
as
if
he
were
some
fool.
“By
law
the
Iron
Throne
should
pass
to
her.”

“By
Dornish
law.”

“When
good
King
Daeron
wed
Princess
Myriah
and
brought
us
into
his
kingdom,
it
was
agreed
that
Dornish
law
would
always
rule
in
Dorne.
And
Myrcella
is
in
Dorne,
as
it
happens.”

“So
she
is.”
His
tone
was
grudging.
“Let
me
think
on
it.”

Tyene
grew
cross.
“You
think
too
much,
Uncle.”

“Do
I?”

“Father
said
so.”

“Oberyn
thought
too
little.”

“Some
men
think
because
they
are
afraid
to
do.”

“There
is
a
difference
between
fear
and
caution.”

“Oh,
I
must
pray
that
I
never
see
you
frightened,
Uncle.
You
might
forget
to
breathe.”
She
raised
a
hand...

The
captain
brought
the
butt
of
his
longaxe
down
upon
the
marble
with
a
thump.
“My
lady,
you
presume.
Step
from
the
dais,
if
it
please
you.”

“I
meant
no
harm,
Captain.
I
love
my
uncle,
as
I
know
he
loved
my
father.”
Tyene
went
to
one
knee
before
the
prince.
“I
have
said
all
I
came
to
say,
Uncle.
Forgive
me
if
I
gave
offense;
my
heart
is
broken
all
to
pieces.
Do
I
still
have
your
love?”

“Always.”

“Give
me
your
blessing,
then,
and
I
shall
go.”

Doran
hesitated
half
a
heartbeat
before
placing
his
hand
on
his
niece’s
head.
“Be
brave,
child.”

“Oh,
how
not?
I
am
his
daughter.”

No
sooner
had
she
taken
her
leave
than
Maester
Caleotte
hurried
to
the
dais.
“My
prince,
she
did
not...
here,
let
me
see
your
hand.”
He
examined
the
palm
first,
then
gently
turned
it
upside
down
to
sniff
at
the
back
of
the
prince’s
fingers.
“No,
good.
That
is
good.
There
are
no
scratches,
so...”

The
prince
withdrew
his
hand.
“Maester,
could
I
trouble
you
for
some
milk
of
the
poppy?
A
thimble
cup
will
suffice.”

“The
poppy.
Yes,
to
be
sure.”

“Now,
I
think,”
Doran
Martell
urged
gently,
and
Caleotte
scurried
to
the
stairs.

Outside
the
sun
had
set.
The
light
within
the
dome
was
the
blue
of
dusk,
and
all
the
diamonds
on
the
floor
were
dying.
The
prince
sat
in
his
high
seat
beneath
the
Martell
spear,
his
face
pale
with
pain.
After
a
long
silence
he
turned
to
Areo
Hotah.
“Captain,”
he
said,
“how
loyal
are
my
guards?”

“Loyal.”
The
captain
did
not
know
what
else
to
say.

“All
of
them?
Or
some?”

“They
are
good
men.
Good
Dornishmen.
They
will
do
as
I
command.”
He
thumped
his
longaxe
on
the
floor.
“I
will
bring
the
head
of
any
man
who
would
betray
you.”

“I
want
no
heads.
I
want
obedience.”

“You
have
it.”
Serve.
Obey.
Protect.
Simple
vows
for
a
simple
man.
“How
many
men
are
needed?”

“I
will
leave
that
for
you
to
decide.
It
may
be
that
a
few
good
men
will
serve
us
better
than
a
score.
I
want
this
done
as
quickly
and
as
quietly
as
possible,
with
no
blood
spilled.”

“Quick
and
quiet
and
bloodless,
aye.
What
is
your
command?”

“You
will
find
my
brother’s
daughters,
take
them
into
custody,
and
confine
them
in
the
cells
atop
the
Spear
Tower.”

“The
Sand
Snakes?”
The
captain’s
throat
was
dry.
“All...
all
eight,
my
prince?
The
little
ones,
also?”

The
prince
considered.
“Ellaria’s
girls
are
too
young
to
be
a
danger,
but
there
are
those
who
might
seek
to
use
them
against
me.
It
would
be
best
to
keep
them
safe
in
hand.
Yes,
the
little
ones
as
well...
but
first
secure
Tyene,
Nymeria,
and
Obara.”

“As
my
prince
commands.”
His
heart
was
troubled.
My
little
princess
will
mislike
this.
“What
of
Sarella?
She
is
a
woman
grown,
almost
twenty.”

“Unless
she
returns
to
Dorne,
there’s
naught
I
can
do
about
Sarella
save
pray
that
she
shows
more
sense
than
her
sisters.
Leave
her
to
her...
game.
Gather
up
the
others.
I
shall
not
sleep
until
I
know
that
they
are
safe
and
under
guard.”

“It
will
be
done.”
The
captain
hesitated.
“When
this
is
known
in
the
streets,
the
common
folk
will
howl.”

“All
Dorne
will
howl,”
said
Doran
Martell
in
a
tired
voice.
“I
only
pray
Lord
Tywin
hears
them
in
King’s
Landing,
so
he
might
know
what
a
loyal
friend
he
has
in
Sunspear.”





CERSEI

She
dreamt
she
sat
the
Iron
Throne,
high
above
them
all.

The
courtiers
were
brightly
colored
mice
below.
Great
lords
and
proud
ladies
knelt
before
her.
Bold
young
knights
laid
their
swords
at
her
feet
and
pleaded
for
her
favors,
and
the
queen
smiled
down
at
them.
Until
the
dwarf
appeared
as
if
from
nowhere,
pointing
at
her
and
howling
with
laughter.
The
lords
and
ladies
began
to
chuckle
too,
hiding
their
smiles
behind
their
hands.
Only
then
did
the
queen
realize
she
was
naked.

Horrified,
she
tried
to
cover
herself
with
her
hands.
The
barbs
and
blades
of
the
Iron
Throne
bit
into
her
flesh
as
she
crouched
to
hide
her
shame.
Blood
ran
red
down
her
legs,
as
steel
teeth
gnawed
at
her
buttocks.
When
she
tried
to
stand,
her
foot
slipped
through
a
gap
in
the
twisted
metal.
The
more
she
struggled
the
more
the
throne
engulfed
her,
tearing
chunks
of
flesh
from
her
breasts
and
belly,
slicing
at
her
arms
and
legs
until
they
were
slick
and
red,
glistening.

And
all
the
while
her
brother
capered
below,
laughing.

His
merriment
still
echoed
in
her
ears
when
she
felt
a
light
touch
on
her
shoulder,
and
woke
suddenly.
For
half
a
heartbeat
the
hand
seemed
part
of
the
nightmare,
and
Cersei
cried
out,
but
it
was
only
Senelle.
The
maid’s
face
was
white
and
frightened.

We
are
not
alone,
the
queen
realized.
Shadows
loomed
around
her
bed,
tall
shapes
with
chainmail
glimmering
beneath
their
cloaks.
Armed
men
had
no
business
here.
Where
are
my
guards?
Her
bedchamber
was
dark,
but
for
the
lantern
one
of
the
intruders
held
on
high.
I
must
show
no
fear.
Cersei
pushed
back
sleep-tousled
hair,
and
said,
“What
do
you
want
of
me?”
A
man
stepped
into
the
lantern
light,
and
she
saw
his
cloak
was
white.
“Jaime?”
I
dreamt
of
one
brother,
but
the
other
has
come
to
wake
me.

“Your
Grace.”
The
voice
was
not
her
brother’s.
“The
Lord
Commander
said
come
get
you.”
His
hair
curled,
as
Jaime’s
did,
but
her
brother’s
hair
was
beaten
gold,
like
hers,
where
this
man’s
was
black
and
oily.
She
stared
at
him,
confused,
as
he
muttered
about
a
privy
and
a
crossbow,
and
said
her
father’s
name.
I
am
dreaming
still,
Cersei
thought.
I
have
not
woken,
nor
has
my
nightmare
ended.
Tyrion
will
creep
out
from
under
the
bed
soon
and
begin
to
laugh
at
me.

But
that
was
folly.
Her
dwarf
brother
was
down
in
the
black
cells,
condemned
to
die
this
very
day.
She
looked
down
at
her
hands,
turning
them
over
to
make
certain
all
her
fingers
were
still
there.
When
she
ran
a
hand
down
her
arm
the
skin
was
covered
with
gooseprickles,
but
unbroken.
There
were
no
cuts
on
her
legs,
no
gashes
on
the
soles
of
her
feet.
A
dream,
that’s
all
it
was,
a
dream.
I
drank
too
much
last
night,
these
fears
are
only
humors
born
of
wine.
I
will
be
the
one
laughing,
come
dusk.
My
children
will
be
safe,
Tommen’s
throne
will
be
secure,
and
my
twisted
little
valonqar
will
be
short
a
head
and
rotting.

Jocelyn
Swyft
was
at
her
elbow,
pressing
a
cup
on
her.
Cersei
took
a
sip:
water,
mixed
with
lemon
squeezings,
so
tart
she
spit
it
out.
She
could
hear
the
night
wind
rattling
the
shutters,
and
she
saw
with
a
strange
sharp
clarity.
Jocelyn
was
trembling
like
a
leaf,
as
frightened
as
Senelle.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
loomed
over
her.
Behind
him
stood
Ser
Boros
Blount,
with
a
lantern.
At
the
door
were
Lannister
guardsmen
with
gilded
lions
shining
on
the
crests
of
their
helmets.
They
looked
afraid
as
well.
Can
it
be?
the
queen
wondered.
Can
it
be
true?

She
rose,
and
let
Senelle
slip
a
bedrobe
over
her
shoulders
to
hide
her
nakedness.
Cersei
belted
it
herself,
her
fingers
stiff
and
clumsy.
“My
lord
father
keeps
guards
about
him,
night
and
day,”
she
said.
Her
tongue
felt
thick.
She
took
another
swallow
of
lemon
water
and
sloshed
it
round
her
mouth
to
freshen
her
breath.
A
moth
had
gotten
into
the
lantern
Ser
Boros
was
holding;
she
could
hear
it
buzzing
and
see
the
shadow
of
its
wings
as
it
beat
against
the
glass.

“The
guards
were
at
their
posts,
Your
Grace,”
said
Osmund
Kettleblack.
“We
found
a
hidden
door
behind
the
hearth.
A
secret
passage.
The
Lord
Commander’s
gone
down
to
see
where
it
goes.”

“Jaime?”
Terror
seized
her,
sudden
as
a
storm.
“Jaime
should
be
with
the
king...”

“The
lad’s
not
been
harmed.
Ser
Jaime
sent
a
dozen
men
to
look
in
on
him.
His
Grace
is
sleeping
peaceful.”

Let
him
have
a
sweeter
dream
than
mine,
and
a
kinder
waking.
“Who
is
with
the
king?”

“Ser
Loras
has
that
honor,
if
it
please
you.”

It
did
not
please
her.
The
Tyrells
were
only
stewards
that
the
dragon-kings
had
upjumped
far
above
their
station.
Their
vanity
was
exceeded
only
by
their
ambition.
Ser
Loras
might
be
as
pretty
as
a
maiden’s
dream,
but
underneath
his
white
cloak
he
was
Tyrell
to
the
bone.
For
all
she
knew,
this
night’s
foul
fruit
had
been
planted
and
nurtured
in
Highgarden.

But
that
was
a
suspicion
she
dare
not
speak
aloud.
“Allow
me
a
moment
to
dress.
Ser
Osmund,
you
shall
accompany
me
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
Ser
Boros,
roust
the
gaolers
and
make
certain
the
dwarf
is
still
in
his
cell.”
She
would
not
say
his
name.
He
would
never
have
found
the
courage
to
lift
a
hand
against
Father,
she
told
herself,
but
she
had
to
be
certain.

“As
Your
Grace
commands.”
Blount
surrendered
the
lantern
to
Ser
Osmund.
Cersei
was
not
displeased
to
see
the
back
of
him.
Father
should
never
have
restored
him
to
the
white.
The
man
had
proved
himself
a
craven.

By
the
time
they
left
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
the
sky
had
turned
a
deep
cobalt
blue,
though
the
stars
still
shone.
All
but
one,
Cersei
thought.
The
bright
star
of
the
west
has
fallen,
and
the
nights
will
be
darker
now.
She
paused
upon
the
drawbridge
that
spanned
the
dry
moat,
gazing
down
at
the
spikes
below.
They
would
not
dare
lie
to
me
about
such
a
thing.
“Who
found
him?”

“One
of
his
guards,”
said
Ser
Osmund.
“Lum.
He
felt
a
call
of
nature,
and
found
his
lordship
in
the
privy.”

No,
that
cannot
be.
That
is
not
the
way
a
lion
dies.
The
queen
felt
strangely
calm.
She
remembered
the
first
time
she
had
lost
a
tooth,
when
she
was
just
a
little
girl.
It
hadn’t
hurt,
but
the
hole
in
her
mouth
felt
so
odd
she
could
not
stop
touching
it
with
her
tongue.
Now
there
is
a
hole
in
the
world
where
Father
stood,
and
holes
want
filling.

If
Tywin
Lannister
was
truly
dead,
no
one
was
safe...
least
of
all
her
son
upon
his
throne.
When
the
lion
falls
the
lesser
beasts
move
in:
the
jackals
and
the
vultures
and
the
feral
dogs.
They
would
try
to
push
her
aside,
as
they
always
had.
She
would
need
to
move
quickly,
as
she
had
when
Robert
died.
This
might
be
the
work
of
Stannis
Baratheon,
through
some
catspaw.
It
could
well
be
the
prelude
to
another
attack
upon
the
city.
She
hoped
it
was.
Let
him
come.
I
will
smash
him,
just
as
Father
did,
and
this
time
he
will
die.
Stannis
did
not
frighten
her,
no
more
than
Mace
Tyrell
did.
No
one
frightened
her.
She
was
a
daughter
of
the
Rock,
a
lion.
There
will
be
no
more
talk
of
forcing
me
to
wed
again.
Casterly
Rock
was
hers
now,
and
all
the
power
of
House
Lannister.
No
one
would
ever
disregard
her
again.
Even
when
Tommen
had
no
further
need
of
a
regent,
the
Lady
of
Casterly
Rock
would
remain
a
power
in
the
land.

The
rising
sun
had
painted
the
tower
tops
a
vivid
red,
but
beneath
the
walls
the
night
still
huddled.
The
outer
castle
was
so
hushed
that
she
could
have
believed
all
its
people
dead.
They
should
be.
It
is
not
fitting
for
Tywin
Lannister
to
die
alone.
Such
a
man
deserves
a
retinue
to
attend
his
needs
in
hell.

Four
spearmen
in
red
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms
were
posted
at
the
door
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“No
one
is
to
enter
or
leave
without
my
permission,”
she
told
them.
The
command
came
easily
to
her.
My
father
had
steel
in
his
voice
as
well.

Within
the
tower,
the
smoke
from
the
torches
irritated
her
eyes,
but
Cersei
did
not
weep,
no
more
than
her
father
would
have.
I
am
the
only
true
son
he
ever
had.
Her
heels
scraped
against
the
stone
as
she
climbed,
and
she
could
still
hear
the
moth
fluttering
wildly
inside
Ser
Osmund’s
lantern.
Die,
the
queen
thought
at
it,
in
irritation,
fly
into
the
flame
and
be
done
with
it.

Two
more
red-cloaked
guardsmen
stood
atop
the
steps.
Red
Lester
muttered
a
condolence
as
she
passed.
The
queen’s
breath
was
coming
fast
and
short,
and
she
could
feel
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
chest.
The
steps,
she
told
herself,
this
cursed
tower
has
too
many
steps.
She
had
half
a
mind
to
tear
it
down.

The
hall
was
full
of
fools
speaking
in
whispers,
as
if
Lord
Tywin
were
asleep
and
they
were
afraid
to
wake
him.
Guards
and
servants
alike
shrank
back
before
her,
mouths
flapping.
She
saw
their
pink
gums
and
waggling
tongues,
but
their
words
made
no
more
sense
than
the
buzzing
of
the
moth.
What
are
they
doing
here?
How
did
they
know?
By
rights
they
should
have
called
her
first.
She
was
the
Queen
Regent,
had
they
forgotten
that?

Before
the
Hand’s
bedchamber
stood
Ser
Meryn
Trant
in
his
white
armor
and
cloak.
The
visor
of
his
helm
was
open,
and
the
bags
beneath
his
eyes
made
him
look
still
half-asleep.
“Clear
these
people
away,”
Cersei
told
him.
“Is
my
father
in
the
privy?”

“They
carried
him
back
to
his
bed,
m’lady.”
Ser
Meryn
pushed
the
door
open
for
her
to
enter.

Morning
light
slashed
through
the
shutters
to
paint
golden
bars
upon
the
rushes
strewn
across
the
floor
of
the
bedchamber.
Her
uncle
Kevan
was
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed,
trying
to
pray,
but
he
could
scarcely
get
the
words
out.
Guardsmen
clustered
near
the
hearth.
The
secret
door
that
Ser
Osmund
had
spoken
of
gaped
open
behind
the
ashes,
no
bigger
than
an
oven.
A
man
would
need
to
crawl.
But
Tyrion
is
only
half
a
man.
The
thought
made
her
angry.
No,
the
dwarf
is
locked
in
a
black
cell.
This
could
not
be
his
work.
Stannis,
she
told
herself,
Stannis
was
behind
it.
He
still
has
adherents
in
the
city.
Him,
or
the
Tyrells...

There
had
always
been
talk
of
secret
passages
within
the
Red
Keep.
Maegor
the
Cruel
was
supposed
to
have
killed
the
men
who
built
the
castle
to
keep
the
knowledge
of
them
secret.
How
many
other
bedchambers
have
hidden
doors?
Cersei
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
dwarf
crawling
out
from
behind
a
tapestry
in
Tommen’s
bedchamber
with
blade
in
hand.
Tommen
is
well
guarded,
she
told
herself.
But
Lord
Tywin
had
been
well
guarded
too.

For
a
moment
she
did
not
recognize
the
dead
man.
He
had
hair
like
her
father,
yes,
but
this
was
some
other
man,
surely,
a
smaller
man,
and
much
older.
His
bedrobe
was
hiked
up
around
his
chest,
leaving
him
naked
below
the
waist.
The
quarrel
had
taken
him
in
his
groin
between
his
navel
and
his
manhood,
and
was
sunk
so
deep
that
only
the
fletching
showed.
His
pubic
hair
was
stiff
with
dried
blood.
More
was
congealing
in
his
navel.

The
smell
of
him
made
her
wrinkle
her
nose.
“Take
the
quarrel
out
of
him,”
she
commanded.
“This
is
the
King’s
Hand!”
And
my
father.
My
lord
father.
Should
I
scream
and
tear
my
hair?
They
said
Catelyn
Stark
had
clawed
her
own
face
to
bloody
ribbons
when
the
Freys
slew
her
precious
Robb.
Would
you
like
that,
Father?
she
wanted
to
ask
him.
Or
would
you
want
me
to
be
strong?
Did
you
weep
for
your
own
father?
Her
grandfather
had
died
when
she
was
only
a
year
old,
but
she
knew
the
story.
Lord
Tytos
had
grown
very
fat,
and
his
heart
burst
one
day
when
he
was
climbing
the
steps
to
his
mistress.
Her
father
was
off
in
King’s
Landing
when
it
happened,
serving
as
the
Mad
King’s
Hand.
Lord
Tywin
was
often
away
in
King’s
Landing
when
she
and
Jaime
were
young.
If
he
wept
when
they
brought
him
word
of
his
father’s
death,
he
did
it
where
no
one
could
see
the
tears.

The
queen
could
feel
her
nails
digging
into
her
palms.
“How
could
you
leave
him
like
this?
My
father
was
Hand
to
three
kings,
as
great
a
man
as
ever
strode
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
The
bells
must
ring
for
him,
as
they
rang
for
Robert.
He
must
be
bathed
and
dressed
as
befits
his
stature,
in
ermine
and
cloth-of-gold
and
crimson
silk.
Where
is
Pycelle?
Where
is
Pycelle?”
She
turned
to
the
guardsmen.
“Puckens,
bring
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
He
must
see
to
Lord
Tywin.”

“He’s
seen
him,
Your
Grace,”
said
Puckens.
“He
came
and
saw
and
went,
to
summon
the
silent
sisters.”

They
sent
for
me
last.
The
realization
made
her
almost
too
angry
for
words.
And
Pycelle
runs
off
to
send
a
message
rather
than
soil
his
soft,
wrinkled
hands.
The
man
is
useless.
“Find
Maester
Ballabar,”
she
commanded.
“Find
Maester
Frenken.
Any
of
them.”
Puckens
and
Shortear
ran
to
obey.
“Where
is
my
brother?”

“Down
the
tunnel.
There’s
a
shaft,
with
iron
rungs
set
in
the
stone.
Ser
Jaime
went
to
see
how
deep
it
goes.”

He
has
only
one
hand,
she
wanted
to
shout
at
them.
One
of
you
should
have
gone.
He
has
no
business
climbing
ladders.
The
men
who
murdered
Father
might
be
down
there,
waiting
for
him.
Her
twin
had
always
been
too
rash,
and
it
would
seem
that
even
losing
a
hand
had
not
taught
him
caution.
She
was
about
to
command
the
guards
to
go
down
after
him
and
bring
him
back
when
Puckens
and
Shortear
returned
with
a
grey-haired
man
between
them.
“Your
Grace,”
said
Shortear,
“this
here
claims
he
was
a
maester.”

The
man
bowed
low.
“How
may
I
serve
Your
Grace?”

His
face
was
vaguely
familiar,
though
Cersei
could
not
place
him.
Old,
but
not
so
old
as
Pycelle.
This
one
has
some
strength
in
him
still.
He
was
tall,
though
slightly
stooped,
with
crinkles
around
his
bold
blue
eyes.
His
throat
is
naked.
“You
wear
no
maester’s
chain.”

“It
was
taken
from
me.
My
name
is
Qyburn,
if
it
please
Your
Grace.
I
treated
your
brother’s
hand.”

“His
stump,
you
mean.”
She
remembered
him
now.
He
had
come
with
Jaime
from
Harrenhal.

“I
could
not
save
Ser
Jaime’s
hand,
it
is
true.
My
arts
saved
his
arm,
however,
mayhaps
his
very
life.
The
Citadel
took
my
chain,
but
they
could
not
take
my
knowledge.”

“You
may
suffice,”
she
decided.
“If
you
fail
me
you
will
lose
more
than
a
chain,
I
promise
you.
Remove
the
quarrel
from
my
father’s
belly
and
make
him
ready
for
the
silent
sisters.”

“As
my
queen
commands.”
Qyburn
went
to
the
bedside,
paused,
looked
back.
“And
how
shall
I
deal
with
the
girl,
Your
Grace?”

“Girl?”
Cersei
had
overlooked
the
second
body.
She
strode
to
the
bed,
flung
aside
the
heap
of
bloody
coverlets,
and
there
she
was,
naked,
cold,
and
pink...
save
for
her
face,
which
had
turned
as
black
as
Joff’s
had
at
his
wedding
feast.
A
chain
of
linked
golden
hands
was
half-buried
in
the
flesh
of
her
throat,
twisted
so
tight
that
it
had
broken
the
skin.
Cersei
hissed
like
an
angry
cat.
“What
is
she
doing
here?”

“We
found
her
there,
Your
Grace,”
said
Shortear.
“It’s
the
Imp’s
whore.”
As
if
that
explained
why
she
was
here.

My
lord
father
had
no
use
for
whores,
she
thought.
After
our
mother
died
he
never
touched
a
woman.
She
gave
the
guardsman
a
chilly
look.
“This
is
not...
when
Lord
Tywin’s
father
died
he
returned
to
Casterly
Rock
to
find
a...
a
woman
of
this
sort...
bedecked
in
his
lady
mother’s
jewels,
wearing
one
of
her
gowns.
He
stripped
them
off
her,
and
all
else
as
well.
For
a
fortnight
she
was
paraded
naked
through
the
streets
of
Lannisport,
to
confess
to
every
man
she
met
that
she
was
a
thief
and
a
harlot.
That
was
how
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
dealt
with
whores.
He
never...
this
woman
was
here
for
some
other
purpose,
not
for...”

“Perhaps
his
lordship
was
questioning
the
girl
about
her
mistress,”
Qyburn
suggested.
“Sansa
Stark
vanished
the
night
the
king
was
murdered,
I
have
heard.”

“That’s
so.”
Cersei
seized
on
the
suggestion
eagerly.
“He
was
questioning
her,
to
be
sure.
There
can
be
no
doubt.”
She
could
see
Tyrion
leering,
his
mouth
twisted
into
a
monkey’s
grin
beneath
the
ruin
of
his
nose.
And
what
better
way
to
question
her
than
naked,
with
her
legs
well
spread?
the
dwarf
whispered.
That’s
how
I
like
to
question
her
too.

The
queen
turned
away.
I
will
not
look
at
her.
Suddenly
it
was
too
much
even
to
be
in
the
same
room
as
the
dead
woman.
She
pushed
past
Qyburn,
out
into
the
hall.

Ser
Osmund
had
been
joined
by
his
brothers
Osney
and
Osfryd.
“There
is
a
dead
woman
in
the
Hand’s
bedchamber,”
Cersei
told
the
three
Kettleblacks.
“No
one
is
ever
to
know
that
she
was
here.”

“Aye,
m’lady.”
Ser
Osney
had
faint
scratches
on
his
cheek
where
another
of
Tyrion’s
whores
had
clawed
him.
“And
what
shall
we
do
with
her?”

“Feed
her
to
your
dogs.
Keep
her
for
a
bedmate.
What
do
I
care?
She
was
never
here.
I’ll
have
the
tongue
of
any
man
who
dares
to
say
she
was.
Do
you
understand
me?”

Osney
and
Osfryd
exchanged
a
look.
“Aye,
Your
Grace.”

She
followed
them
back
inside
and
watched
as
they
bundled
the
girl
up
in
her
father’s
bloody
blankets.
Shae,
her
name
was
Shae.
They
had
last
spoken
the
night
before
the
dwarf’s
trial
by
combat,
after
that
smiling
Dornish
snake
offered
to
champion
him.
Shae
had
been
asking
about
some
jewels
Tyrion
had
given
her,
and
certain
promises
Cersei
might
have
made,
a
manse
in
the
city
and
a
knight
to
marry
her.
The
queen
made
it
plain
that
the
whore
would
have
nothing
of
her
until
she
told
them
where
Sansa
Stark
had
gone.
“You
were
her
maid.
Do
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
knew
nothing
of
her
plans?”
she
had
said.
Shae
left
in
tears.

Ser
Osfryd
slung
the
bundled
corpse
up
over
his
shoulder.
“I
want
that
chain,”
Cersei
said.
“See
that
you
do
not
scratch
the
gold.”
Osfryd
nodded
and
started
toward
the
door.
“No,
not
through
the
yard.”
She
gestured
toward
the
secret
passage.
“There’s
a
shaft
down
to
the
dungeons.
That
way.”

As
Ser
Osfryd
went
down
on
one
knee
before
the
hearth,
the
light
brightened
within,
and
the
queen
heard
noises.
Jaime
emerged
bent
over
like
an
old
woman,
his
boots
kicking
up
puffs
of
soot
from
Lord
Tywin’s
last
fire.
“Get
out
of
my
way,”
he
told
the
Kettleblacks.

Cersei
rushed
toward
him.
“Did
you
find
them?
Did
you
find
the
killers?
How
many
were
there?”
Surely
there
had
been
more
than
one.
One
man
alone
could
not
have
killed
her
father.

Her
twin’s
face
had
a
haggard
look.
“The
shaft
goes
down
to
a
chamber
where
half
a
dozen
tunnels
meet.
They’re
closed
off
by
iron
gates,
chained
and
locked.
I
need
to
find
keys.”
He
glanced
around
the
bedchamber.
“Whoever
did
this
might
still
be
lurking
in
the
walls.
It’s
a
maze
back
there,
and
dark.”

She
imagined
Tyrion
creeping
between
the
walls
like
some
monstrous
rat.
No.
You
are
being
silly.
The
dwarf
is
in
his
cell.
“Take
hammers
to
the
walls.
Knock
this
tower
down,
if
you
must.
I
want
them
found.
Whoever
did
this.
I
want
them
killed.”

Jaime
hugged
her,
his
good
hand
pressing
against
the
small
of
her
back.
He
smelled
of
ash,
but
the
morning
sun
was
in
his
hair,
giving
it
a
golden
glow.
She
wanted
to
draw
his
face
to
hers
for
a
kiss.
Later,
she
told
herself,
later
he
will
come
to
me,
for
comfort.
“We
are
his
heirs,
Jaime,”
she
whispered.
“It
will
be
up
to
us
to
finish
his
work.
You
must
take
Father’s
place
as
Hand.
You
see
that
now,
surely.
Tommen
will
need
you...”

He
pushed
away
from
her
and
raised
his
arm,
forcing
his
stump
into
her
face.
“A
Hand
without
a
hand?
A
bad
jape,
sister.
Don’t
ask
me
to
rule.”

Their
uncle
heard
the
rebuff.
Qyburn
as
well,
and
the
Kettleblacks,
wrestling
their
bundle
through
the
ashes.
Even
the
guardsmen
heard,
Puckens
and
Hoke
the
Horseleg
and
Shortear.
It
will
be
all
over
the
castle
by
nightfall.
Cersei
felt
the
heat
rising
up
her
cheeks.
“Rule?
I
said
naught
of
ruling.
I
shall
rule
until
my
son
comes
of
age.”

“I
don’t
know
who
I
pity
more,”
her
brother
said.
“Tommen,
or
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”

She
slapped
him.
Jaime’s
arm
rose
to
catch
the
blow,
cat-quick...
but
this
cat
had
a
cripple’s
stump
in
place
of
a
right
hand.
Her
fingers
left
red
marks
on
his
cheek.

The
sound
brought
their
uncle
to
his
feet.
“Your
father
lies
here
dead.
Have
the
decency
to
take
your
quarrel
outside.”

Jaime
inclined
his
head
in
apology.
“Forgive
us,
Uncle.
My
=======
“We
should
start
back,”
Gared
urged
as
the
woods
began
to
grow
dark
around
them.
“The
wildlings
are
dead.”

“Do
the
dead
frighten
you?”
Ser
Waymar
Royce
asked
with
just
the
hint
of
a
smile.

Gared
did
not
rise
to
the
bait.
He
was
an
old
man,
past
fifty,
and
he
had
seen
the
lordlings
come
and
go.
“Dead
is
dead,”
he
said.
“We
have
no
business
with
the
dead.”

“Are
they
dead?”
Royce
asked
softly.
“What
proof
have
we?”

“Will
saw
them,”
Gared
said.
“If
he
says
they
are
dead,
that’s
proof
enough
for
me.”

Will
had
known
they
would
drag
him
into
the
quarrel
sooner
or
later.
He
wished
it
had
been
later
rather
than
sooner.
“My
mother
told
me
that
dead
men
sing
no
songs,”
he
put
in.

“My
wet
nurse
said
the
same
thing,
Will,”
Royce
replied.
“Never
believe
anything
you
hear
at
a
woman’s
tit.
There
are
things
to
be
learned
even
from
the
dead.”
His
voice
echoed,
too
loud
in
the
twilit
forest.

“We
have
a
long
ride
before
us,”
Gared
pointed
out.
“Eight
days,
maybe
nine.
And
night
is
falling.”

Ser
Waymar
Royce
glanced
at
the
sky
with
disinterest.
“It
does
that
every
day
about
this
time.
Are
you
unmanned
by
the
dark,
Gared?”

Will
could
see
the
tightness
around
Gared’s
mouth,
the
barely
suppressed
anger
in
his
eyes
under
the
thick
black
hood
of
his
cloak.
Gared
had
spent
forty
years
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
man
and
boy,
and
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
made
light
of.
Yet
it
was
more
than
that.
Under
the
wounded
pride,
Will
could
sense
something
else
in
the
older
man.
You
could
taste
it;
a
nervous
tension
that
came
perilous
close
to
fear.

Will
shared
his
unease.
He
had
been
four
years
on
the
Wall.
The
first
time
he
had
been
sent
beyond,
all
the
old
stories
had
come
rushing
back,
and
his
bowels
had
turned
to
water.
He
had
laughed
about
it
afterward.
He
was
a
veteran
of
a
hundred
rangings
by
now,
and
the
endless
dark
wilderness
that
the
southron
called
the
haunted
forest
had
no
more
terrors
for
him.

Until
tonight.
Something
was
different
tonight.
There
was
an
edge
to
this
darkness
that
made
his
hackles
rise.
Nine
days
they
had
been
riding,
north
and
northwest
and
then
north
again,
farther
and
farther
from
the
Wall,
hard
on
the
track
of
a
band
of
wildling
raiders.
Each
day
had
been
worse
than
the
day
that
had
come
before
it.
Today
was
the
worst
of
all.
A
cold
wind
was
blowing
out
of
the
north,
and
it
made
the
trees
rustle
like
living
things.
All
day,
Will
had
felt
as
though
something
were
watching
him,
something
cold
and
implacable
that
loved
him
not.
Gared
had
felt
it
too.
Will
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
ride
hellbent
for
the
safety
of
the
Wall,
but
that
was
not
a
feeling
to
share
with
your
commander.

Especially
not
a
commander
like
this
one.

Ser
Waymar
Royce
was
the
youngest
son
of
an
ancient
house
with
too
many
heirs.
He
was
a
handsome
youth
of
eighteen,
grey-eyed
and
graceful
and
slender
as
a
knife.
Mounted
on
his
huge
black
destrier,
the
knight
towered
above
Will
and
Gared
on
their
smaller
garrons.
He
wore
black
leather
boots,
black
woolen
pants,
black
moleskin
gloves,
and
a
fine
supple
coat
of
gleaming
black
ringmail
over
layers
of
black
wool
and
boiled
leather.
Ser
Waymar
had
been
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
for
less
than
half
a
year,
but
no
one
could
say
he
had
not
prepared
for
his
vocation.
At
least
insofar
as
his
wardrobe
was
concerned.

His
cloak
was
his
crowning
glory;
sable,
thick
and
black
and
soft
as
sin.
“Bet
he
killed
them
all
himself,
he
did,”
Gared
told
the
barracks
over
wine,
“twisted
their
little
heads
off,
our
mighty
warrior.”
They
had
all
shared
the
laugh.

It
is
hard
to
take
orders
from
a
man
you
laughed
at
in
your
cups,
Will
reflected
as
he
sat
shivering
atop
his
garron.
Gared
must
have
felt
the
same.

“Mormont
said
as
we
should
track
them,
and
we
did,”
Gared
said.
“They’re
dead.
They
shan’t
trouble
us
no
more.
There’s
hard
riding
before
us.
I
don’t
like
this
weather.
If
it
snows,
we
could
be
a
fortnight
getting
back,
and
snow’s
the
best
we
can
hope
for.
Ever
seen
an
ice
storm,
my
lord?”

The
lordling
seemed
not
to
hear
him.
He
studied
the
deepening
twilight
in
that
half-bored,
half-distracted
way
he
had.
Will
had
ridden
with
the
knight
long
enough
to
understand
that
it
was
best
not
to
interrupt
him
when
he
looked
like
that.
“Tell
me
again
what
you
saw,
Will.
All
the
details.
Leave
nothing
out.”

Will
had
been
a
hunter
before
he
joined
the
Night’s
Watch.
Well,
a
poacher
in
truth.
Mallister
freeriders
had
caught
him
red-handed
in
the
Mallisters’
own
woods,
skinning
one
of
the
Mallisters’
own
bucks,
and
it
had
been
a
choice
of
putting
on
the
black
or
losing
a
hand.
No
one
could
move
through
the
woods
as
silent
as
Will,
and
it
had
not
taken
the
black
brothers
long
to
discover
his
talent.

“The
camp
is
two
miles
farther
on,
over
that
ridge,
hard
beside
a
stream,”
Will
said.
“I
got
close
as
I
dared.
There’s
eight
of
them,
men
and
women
both.
No
children
I
could
see.
They
put
up
a
lean-to
against
the
rock.
The
snow’s
pretty
well
covered
it
now,
but
I
could
still
make
it
out.
No
fire
burning,
but
the
firepit
was
still
plain
as
day.
No
one
moving.
I
watched
a
long
time.
No
living
man
ever
lay
so
still.”

“Did
you
see
any
blood?”

“Well,
no,”
Will
admitted.

“Did
you
see
any
weapons?”

“Some
swords,
a
few
bows.
One
man
had
an
axe.
Heavy-looking,
double-bladed,
a
cruel
piece
of
iron.
It
was
on
the
ground
beside
him,
right
by
his
hand.”

“Did
you
make
note
of
the
position
of
the
bodies?”

Will
shrugged.
“A
couple
are
sitting
up
against
the
rock.
Most
of
them
on
the
ground.
Fallen,
like.”

“Or
sleeping,”
Royce
suggested.

“Fallen,”
Will
insisted.
“There’s
one
woman
up
an
ironwood,
half-hid
in
the
branches.
A
far-eyes.”
He
smiled
thinly.
“I
took
care
she
never
saw
me.
When
I
got
closer,
I
saw
that
she
wasn’t
moving
neither.”
Despite
himself,
he
shivered.

“You
have
a
chill?”
Royce
asked.

“Some,”
Will
muttered.
“The
wind,
m’lord.”

The
young
knight
turned
back
to
his
grizzled
man-at-arms.
Frostfallen
leaves
whispered
past
them,
and
Royce’s
destrier
moved
restlessly.
“What
do
you
think
might
have
killed
these
men,
Gared?”
Ser
Waymar
asked
casually.
He
adjusted
the
drape
of
his
long
sable
cloak.

“It
was
the
cold,”
Gared
said
with
iron
certainty.
“I
saw
men
freeze
last
winter,
and
the
one
before,
when
I
was
half
a
boy.
Everyone
talks
about
snows
forty
foot
deep,
and
how
the
ice
wind
comes
howling
out
of
the
north,
but
the
real
enemy
is
the
cold.
It
steals
up
on
you
quieter
than
Will,
and
at
first
you
shiver
and
your
teeth
chatter
and
you
stamp
your
feet
and
dream
of
mulled
wine
and
nice
hot
fires.
It
burns,
it
does.
Nothing
burns
like
the
cold.
But
only
for
a
while.
Then
it
gets
inside
you
and
starts
to
fill
you
up,
and
after
a
while
you
don’t
have
the
strength
to
fight
it.
It’s
easier
just
to
sit
down
or
go
to
sleep.
They
say
you
don’t
feel
any
pain
toward
the
end.
First
you
go
weak
and
drowsy,
and
everything
starts
to
fade,
and
then
it’s
like
sinking
into
a
sea
of
warm
milk.
Peaceful,
like.”

“Such
eloquence,
Gared,”
Ser
Waymar
observed.
“I
never
suspected
you
had
it
in
you.”

“I’ve
had
the
cold
in
me
too,
lordling.”
Gared
pulled
back
his
hood,
giving
Ser
Waymar
a
good
long
look
at
the
stumps
where
his
ears
had
been.
“Two
ears,
three
toes,
and
the
little
finger
off
my
left
hand.
I
got
off
light.
We
found
my
brother
frozen
at
his
watch,
with
a
smile
on
his
face.”

Ser
Waymar
shrugged.
“You
ought
dress
more
warmly,
Gared.”

Gared
glared
at
the
lordling,
the
scars
around
his
ear
holes
flushed
red
with
anger
where
Maester
Aemon
had
cut
the
ears
away.
“We’ll
see
how
warm
you
can
dress
when
the
winter
comes.”
He
pulled
up
his
hood
and
hunched
over
his
garron,
silent
and
sullen.

“If
Gared
said
it
was
the
cold…”
Will
began.

“Have
you
drawn
any
watches
this
past
week,
Will?”

“Yes,
m’lord.”
There
never
was
a
week
when
he
did
not
draw
a
dozen
bloody
watches.
What
was
the
man
driving
at?

“And
how
did
you
find
the
Wall?”

“Weeping,”
Will
said,
frowning.
He
saw
it
clear
enough,
now
that
the
lordling
had
pointed
it
out.
“They
couldn’t
have
froze.
Not
if
the
Wall
was
weeping.
It
wasn’t
cold
enough.”

Royce
nodded.
“Bright
lad.
We’ve
had
a
few
light
frosts
this
past
week,
and
a
quick
flurry
of
snow
now
and
then,
but
surely
no
cold
fierce
enough
to
kill
eight
grown
men.
Men
clad
in
fur
and
leather,
let
me
remind
you,
with
shelter
near
at
hand,
and
the
means
of
making
fire.”
The
knight’s
smile
was
cocksure.
“Will,
lead
us
there.
I
would
see
these
dead
men
for
myself.”

And
then
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it.
The
order
had
been
given,
and
honor
bound
them
to
obey.

Will
went
in
front,
his
shaggy
little
garron
picking
the
way
carefully
through
the
undergrowth.
A
light
snow
had
fallen
the
night
before,
and
there
were
stones
and
roots
and
hidden
sinks
lying
just
under
its
crust,
waiting
for
the
careless
and
the
unwary.
Ser
Waymar
Royce
came
next,
his
great
black
destrier
snorting
impatiently.
The
warhorse
was
the
wrong
mount
for
ranging,
but
try
and
tell
that
to
the
lordling.
Gared
brought
up
the
rear.
The
old
man-at-arms
muttered
to
himself
as
he
rode.

Twilight
deepened.
The
cloudless
sky
turned
a
deep
purple,
the
color
of
an
old
bruise,
then
faded
to
black.
The
stars
began
to
come
out.
A
half-moon
rose.
Will
was
grateful
for
the
light.

“We
can
make
a
better
pace
than
this,
surely,”
Royce
said
when
the
moon
was
full
risen.

“Not
with
this
horse,”
Will
said.
Fear
had
made
him
insolent.
“Perhaps
my
lord
would
care
to
take
the
lead?”

Ser
Waymar
Royce
did
not
deign
to
reply.

Somewhere
off
in
the
wood
a
wolf
howled.

Will
pulled
his
garron
over
beneath
an
ancient
gnarled
ironwood
and
dismounted.

“Why
are
you
stopping?”
Ser
Waymar
asked.

“Best
go
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot,
m’lord.
It’s
just
over
that
ridge.”

Royce
paused
a
moment,
staring
off
into
the
distance,
his
face
reflective.
A
cold
wind
whispered
through
the
trees.
His
great
sable
cloak
stirred
behind
like
something
half-alive.

“There’s
something
wrong
here,”
Gared
muttered.

The
young
knight
gave
him
a
disdainful
smile.
“Is
there?”

“Can’t
you
feel
it?”
Gared
asked.
“Listen
to
the
darkness.”

Will
could
feel
it.
Four
years
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
he
had
never
been
so
afraid.
What
was
it?

“Wind.
Trees
rustling.
A
wolf.
Which
sound
is
it
that
unmans
you
so,
Gared?”
When
Gared
did
not
answer,
Royce
slid
gracefully
from
his
saddle.
He
tied
the
destrier
securely
to
a
low-hanging
limb,
well
away
from
the
other
horses,
and
drew
his
longsword
from
its
sheath.
Jewels
glittered
in
its
hilt,
and
the
moonlight
ran
down
the
shining
steel.
It
was
a
splendid
weapon,
castle-forged,
and
new-made
from
the
look
of
it.
Will
doubted
it
had
ever
been
swung
in
anger.

“The
trees
press
close
here,”
Will
warned.
“That
sword
will
tangle
you
up,
m’lord.
Better
a
knife.”

“If
I
need
instruction,
I
will
ask
for
it,”
the
young
lord
said.
“Gared,
stay
here.
Guard
the
horses.”

Gared
dismounted.
“We
need
a
fire.
I’ll
see
to
it.”

“How
big
a
fool
are
you,
old
man?
If
there
are
enemies
in
this
wood,
a
fire
is
the
last
thing
we
want.”

“There’s
some
enemies
a
fire
will
keep
away,”
Gared
said.
“Bears
and
direwolves
and…
and
other
things…”

Ser
Waymar’s
mouth
became
a
hard
line.
“No
fire.”

Gared’s
hood
shadowed
his
face,
but
Will
could
see
the
hard
glitter
in
his
eyes
as
he
stared
at
the
knight.
For
a
moment
he
was
afraid
the
older
man
would
go
for
his
sword.
It
was
a
short,
ugly
thing,
its
grip
discolored
by
sweat,
its
edge
nicked
from
hard
use,
but
Will
would
not
have
given
an
iron
bob
for
the
lordling’s
life
if
Gared
pulled
it
from
its
scabbard.

Finally
Gared
looked
down.
“No
fire,”
he
muttered,
low
under
his
breath.

Royce
took
it
for
acquiescence
and
turned
away.
“Lead
on,”
he
said
to
Will.

Will
threaded
their
way
through
a
thicket,
then
started
up
the
slope
to
the
low
ridge
where
he
had
found
his
vantage
point
under
a
sentinel
tree.
Under
the
thin
crust
of
snow,
the
ground
was
damp
and
muddy,
slick
footing,
with
rocks
and
hidden
roots
to
trip
you
up.
Will
made
no
sound
as
he
climbed.
Behind
him,
he
heard
the
soft
metallic
slither
of
the
lordling’s
ringmail,
the
rustle
of
leaves,
and
muttered
curses
as
reaching
branches
grabbed
at
his
longsword
and
tugged
on
his
splendid
sable
cloak.

The
great
sentinel
was
right
there
at
the
top
of
the
ridge,
where
Will
had
known
it
would
be,
its
lowest
branches
a
bare
foot
off
the
ground.
Will
slid
in
underneath,
flat
on
his
belly
in
the
snow
and
the
mud,
and
looked
down
on
the
empty
clearing
below.

His
heart
stopped
in
his
chest.
For
a
moment
he
dared
not
breathe.
Moonlight
shone
down
on
the
clearing,
the
ashes
of
the
firepit,
the
snow-covered
lean-to,
the
great
rock,
the
little
half-frozen
stream.
Everything
was
just
as
it
had
been
a
few
hours
ago.

They
were
gone.
All
the
bodies
were
gone.

“Gods!”
he
heard
behind
him.
A
sword
slashed
at
a
branch
as
Ser
Waymar
Royce
gained
the
ridge.
He
stood
there
beside
the
sentinel,
longsword
in
hand,
his
cloak
billowing
behind
him
as
the
wind
came
up,
outlined
nobly
against
the
stars
for
all
to
see.

“Get
down!”
Will
whispered
urgently.
“Something’s
wrong.”

Royce
did
not
move.
He
looked
down
at
the
empty
clearing
and
laughed.
“Your
dead
men
seem
to
have
moved
camp,
Will.”

Will’s
voice
abandoned
him.
He
groped
for
words
that
did
not
come.
It
was
not
possible.
His
eyes
swept
back
and
forth
over
the
abandoned
campsite,
stopped
on
the
axe.
A
huge
double-bladed
battle-axe,
still
lying
where
he
had
seen
it
last,
untouched.
A
valuable
weapon…

“On
your
feet,
Will,”
Ser
Waymar
commanded.
“There’s
no
one
here.
I
won’t
have
you
hiding
under
a
bush.”

Reluctantly,
Will
obeyed.

Ser
Waymar
looked
him
over
with
open
disapproval.
“I
am
not
going
back
to
Castle
Black
a
failure
on
my
first
ranging.
We
will
find
these
men.”
He
glanced
around.
“Up
the
tree.
Be
quick
about
it.
Look
for
a
fire.”

Will
turned
away,
wordless.
There
was
no
use
to
argue.
The
wind
was
moving.
It
cut
right
through
him.
He
went
to
the
tree,
a
vaulting
grey-green
sentinel,
and
began
to
climb.
Soon
his
hands
were
sticky
with
sap,
and
he
was
lost
among
the
needles.
Fear
filled
his
gut
like
a
meal
he
could
not
digest.
He
whispered
a
prayer
to
the
nameless
gods
of
the
wood,
and
slipped
his
dirk
free
of
its
sheath.
He
put
it
between
his
teeth
to
keep
both
hands
free
for
climbing.
The
taste
of
cold
iron
in
his
mouth
gave
him
comfort.

Down
below,
the
lordling
called
out
suddenly,
“Who
goes
there?”
Will
heard
uncertainty
in
the
challenge.
He
stopped
climbing;
he
listened;
he
watched.

The
woods
gave
answer:
the
rustle
of
leaves,
the
icy
rush
of
the
stream,
a
distant
hoot
of
a
snow
owl.

The
Others
made
no
sound.

Will
saw
movement
from
the
corner
of
his
eye.
Pale
shapes
gliding
through
the
wood.
He
turned
his
head,
glimpsed
a
white
shadow
in
the
darkness.
Then
it
was
gone.
Branches
stirred
gently
in
the
wind,
scratching
at
one
another
with
wooden
fingers.
Will
opened
his
mouth
to
call
down
a
warning,
and
the
words
seemed
to
freeze
in
his
throat.
Perhaps
he
was
wrong.
Perhaps
it
had
only
been
a
bird,
a
reflection
on
the
snow,
some
trick
of
the
moonlight.
What
had
he
seen,
after
all?

“Will,
where
are
you?”
Ser
Waymar
called
up.
“Can
you
see
anything?”
He
was
turning
in
a
slow
circle,
suddenly
wary,
his
sword
in
hand.
He
must
have
felt
them,
as
Will
felt
them.
There
was
nothing
to
see.
“Answer
me!
Why
is
it
so
cold?”

It
was
cold.
Shivering,
Will
clung
more
tightly
to
his
perch.
His
face
pressed
hard
against
the
trunk
of
the
sentinel.
He
could
feel
the
sweet,
sticky
sap
on
his
cheek.

A
shadow
emerged
from
the
dark
of
the
wood.
It
stood
in
front
of
Royce.
Tall,
it
was,
and
gaunt
and
hard
as
old
bones,
with
flesh
pale
as
milk.
Its
armor
seemed
to
change
color
as
it
moved;
here
it
was
white
as
new-fallen
snow,
there
black
as
shadow,
everywhere
dappled
with
the
deep
grey-green
of
the
trees.
The
patterns
ran
like
moonlight
on
water
with
every
step
it
took.

Will
heard
the
breath
go
out
of
Ser
Waymar
Royce
in
a
long
hiss.
“Come
no
farther,”
the
lordling
warned.
His
voice
cracked
like
a
boy’s.
He
threw
the
long
sable
cloak
back
over
his
shoulders,
to
free
his
arms
for
battle,
and
took
his
sword
in
both
hands.
The
wind
had
stopped.
It
was
very
cold.

The
Other
slid
forward
on
silent
feet.
In
its
hand
was
a
longsword
like
none
that
Will
had
ever
seen.
No
human
metal
had
gone
into
the
forging
of
that
blade.
It
was
alive
with
moonlight,
translucent,
a
shard
of
crystal
so
thin
that
it
seemed
almost
to
vanish
when
seen
edge-on.
There
was
a
faint
blue
shimmer
to
the
thing,
a
ghost-light
that
played
around
its
edges,
and
somehow
Will
knew
it
was
sharper
than
any
razor.

Ser
Waymar
met
him
bravely.
“Dance
with
me
then.”
He
lifted
his
sword
high
over
his
head,
defiant.
His
hands
trembled
from
the
weight
of
it,
or
perhaps
from
the
cold.
Yet
in
that
moment,
Will
thought,
he
was
a
boy
no
longer,
but
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.

The
Other
halted.
Will
saw
its
eyes;
blue,
deeper
and
bluer
than
any
human
eyes,
a
blue
that
burned
like
ice.
They
fixed
on
the
longsword
trembling
on
high,
watched
the
moonlight
running
cold
along
the
metal.
For
a
heartbeat
he
dared
to
hope.

They
emerged
silently
from
the
shadows,
twins
to
the
first.
Three
of
them…
four…
five…
Ser
Waymar
may
have
felt
the
cold
that
came
with
them,
but
he
never
saw
them,
never
heard
them.
Will
had
to
call
out.
It
was
his
duty.
And
his
death,
if
he
did.
He
shivered,
and
hugged
the
tree,
and
kept
the
silence.

The
pale
sword
came
shivering
through
the
air.

Ser
Waymar
met
it
with
steel.
When
the
blades
met,
there
was
no
ring
of
metal
on
metal;
only
a
high,
thin
sound
at
the
edge
of
hearing,
like
an
animal
screaming
in
pain.
Royce
checked
a
second
blow,
and
a
third,
then
fell
back
a
step.
Another
flurry
of
blows,
and
he
fell
back
again.

Behind
him,
to
right,
to
left,
all
around
him,
the
watchers
stood
patient,
faceless,
silent,
the
shifting
patterns
of
their
delicate
armor
making
them
all
but
invisible
in
the
wood.
Yet
they
made
no
move
to
interfere.

Again
and
again
the
swords
met,
until
Will
wanted
to
cover
his
ears
against
the
strange
anguished
keening
of
their
clash.
Ser
Waymar
was
panting
from
the
effort
now,
his
breath
steaming
in
the
moonlight.
His
blade
was
white
with
frost;
the
Other’s
danced
with
pale
blue
light.

Then
Royce’s
parry
came
a
beat
too
late.
The
pale
sword
bit
through
the
ringmail
beneath
his
arm.
The
young
lord
cried
out
in
pain.
Blood
welled
between
the
rings.
It
steamed
in
the
cold,
and
the
droplets
seemed
red
as
fire
where
they
touched
the
snow.
Ser
Waymar’s
fingers
brushed
his
side.
His
moleskin
glove
came
away
soaked
with
red.

The
Other
said
something
in
a
language
that
Will
did
not
know;
his
voice
was
like
the
cracking
of
ice
on
a
winter
lake,
and
the
words
were
mocking.

Ser
Waymar
Royce
found
his
fury.
“For
Robert!”
he
shouted,
and
he
came
up
snarling,
lifting
the
frost-covered
longsword
with
both
hands
and
swinging
it
around
in
a
flat
sidearm
slash
with
all
his
weight
behind
it.
The
Other’s
parry
was
almost
lazy.

When
the
blades
touched,
the
steel
shattered.

A
scream
echoed
through
the
forest
night,
and
the
longsword
shivered
into
a
hundred
brittle
pieces,
the
shards
scattering
like
a
rain
of
needles.
Royce
went
to
his
knees,
shrieking,
and
covered
his
eyes.
Blood
welled
between
his
fingers.

The
watchers
moved
forward
together,
as
if
some
signal
had
been
given.
Swords
rose
and
fell,
all
in
a
deathly
silence.
It
was
cold
butchery.
The
pale
blades
sliced
through
ringmail
as
if
it
were
silk.
Will
closed
his
eyes.
Far
beneath
him,
he
heard
their
voices
and
laughter
sharp
as
icicles.

When
he
found
the
courage
to
look
again,
a
long
time
had
passed,
and
the
ridge
below
was
empty.

He
stayed
in
the
tree,
scarce
daring
to
breathe,
while
the
moon
crept
slowly
across
the
black
sky.
Finally,
his
muscles
cramping
and
his
fingers
numb
with
cold,
he
climbed
down.

Royce’s
body
lay
facedown
in
the
snow,
one
arm
outflung.
The
thick
sable
cloak
had
been
slashed
in
a
dozen
places.
Lying
dead
like
that,
you
saw
how
young
he
was.
A
boy.

He
found
what
was
left
of
the
sword
a
few
feet
away,
the
end
splintered
and
twisted
like
a
tree
struck
by
lightning.
Will
knelt,
looked
around
warily,
and
snatched
it
up.
The
broken
sword
would
be
his
proof.
Gared
would
know
what
to
make
of
it,
and
if
not
him,
then
surely
that
old
bear
Mormont
or
Maester
Aemon.
Would
Gared
still
be
waiting
with
the
horses?
He
had
to
hurry.

Will
rose.
Ser
Waymar
Royce
stood
over
him.

His
fine
clothes
were
a
tatter,
his
face
a
ruin.
A
shard
from
his
sword
transfixed
the
blind
white
pupil
of
his
left
eye.

The
right
eye
was
open.
The
pupil
burned
blue.
It
saw.

The
broken
sword
fell
from
nerveless
fingers.
Will
closed
his
eyes
to
pray.
Long,
elegant
hands
brushed
his
cheek,
then
tightened
around
his
throat.
They
were
gloved
in
the
finest
moleskin
and
sticky
with
blood,
yet
the
touch
was
icy
cold.





BRAN

The
morning
had
dawned
clear
and
cold,
with
a
crispness
that
hinted
at
the
end
of
summer.
They
set
forth
at
daybreak
to
see
a
man
beheaded,
twenty
in
all,
and
Bran
rode
among
them,
nervous
with
excitement.
This
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
deemed
old
enough
to
go
with
his
lord
father
and
his
brothers
to
see
the
king’s
justice
done.
It
was
the
ninth
year
of
summer,
and
the
seventh
of
Bran’s
life.

The
man
had
been
taken
outside
a
small
holdfast
in
the
hills.
Robb
thought
he
was
a
wildling,
his
sword
sworn
to
Mance
Rayder,
the
King-beyond-the-Wall.
It
made
Bran’s
skin
prickle
to
think
of
it.
He
remembered
the
hearth
tales
Old
Nan
told
them.
The
wildlings
were
cruel
men,
she
said,
slavers
and
slayers
and
thieves.
They
consorted
with
giants
and
ghouls,
stole
girl
children
in
the
dead
of
night,
and
drank
blood
from
polished
horns.
And
their
women
lay
with
the
Others
in
the
Long
Night
to
sire
terrible
half-human
children.

But
the
man
they
found
bound
hand
and
foot
to
the
holdfast
wall
awaiting
the
king’s
justice
was
old
and
scrawny,
not
much
taller
than
Robb.
He
had
lost
both
ears
and
a
finger
to
frostbite,
and
he
dressed
all
in
black,
the
same
as
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
except
that
his
furs
were
ragged
and
greasy.

The
breath
of
man
and
horse
mingled,
steaming,
in
the
cold
morning
air
as
his
lord
father
had
the
man
cut
down
from
the
wall
and
dragged
before
them.
Robb
and
Jon
sat
tall
and
still
on
their
horses,
with
Bran
between
them
on
his
pony,
trying
to
seem
older
than
seven,
trying
to
pretend
that
he’d
seen
all
this
before.
A
faint
wind
blew
through
the
holdfast
gate.
Over
their
heads
flapped
the
banner
of
the
Starks
of
Winterfell:
a
grey
direwolf
racing
across
an
ice-white
field.

Bran’s
father
sat
solemnly
on
his
horse,
long
brown
hair
stirring
in
the
wind.
His
closely
trimmed
beard
was
shot
with
white,
making
him
look
older
than
his
thirty-five
years.
He
had
a
grim
cast
to
his
grey
eyes
this
day,
and
he
seemed
not
at
all
the
man
who
would
sit
before
the
fire
in
the
evening
and
talk
softly
of
the
age
of
heroes
and
the
children
of
the
forest.
He
had
taken
off
Father’s
face,
Bran
thought,
and
donned
the
face
of
Lord
Stark
of
Winterfell.

There
were
questions
asked
and
answers
given
there
in
the
chill
of
morning,
but
afterward
Bran
could
not
recall
much
of
what
had
been
said.
Finally
his
lord
father
gave
a
command,
and
two
of
his
guardsmen
dragged
the
ragged
man
to
the
ironwood
stump
in
the
center
of
the
square.
They
forced
his
head
down
onto
the
hard
black
wood.
Lord
Eddard
Stark
dismounted
and
his
ward
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
forth
the
sword.
“Ice,”
that
sword
was
called.
It
was
as
wide
across
as
a
man’s
hand,
and
taller
even
than
Robb.
The
blade
was
Valyrian
steel,
spell-forged
and
dark
as
smoke.
Nothing
held
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel.

His
father
peeled
off
his
gloves
and
handed
them
to
Jory
Cassel,
the
captain
of
his
household
guard.
He
took
hold
of
Ice
with
both
hands
and
said,
“In
the
name
of
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
by
the
word
of
Eddard
of
the
House
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Warden
of
the
North,
I
do
sentence
you
to
die.”
He
lifted
the
greatsword
high
above
his
head.

Bran’s
bastard
brother
Jon
Snow
moved
closer.
“Keep
the
pony
well
in
hand,”
he
whispered.
“And
don’t
look
away.
Father
will
know
if
you
do.”

Bran
kept
his
pony
well
in
hand,
and
did
not
look
away.

His
father
took
off
the
man’s
head
with
a
single
sure
stroke.
Blood
sprayed
out
across
the
snow,
as
red
as
surnmerwine.
One
of
the
horses
reared
and
had
to
be
restrained
to
keep
from
bolting.
Bran
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
blood.
The
snows
around
the
stump
drank
it
eagerly,
reddening
as
he
watched.

The
head
bounced
off
a
thick
root
and
rolled.
It
came
up
near
Greyjoy’s
feet.
Theon
was
a
lean,
dark
youth
of
nineteen
who
found
everything
amusing.
He
laughed,
put
his
boot
on
the
head,
and
kicked
it
away.

“Ass,”
Jon
muttered,
low
enough
so
Greyjoy
did
not
hear.
He
put
a
hand
on
Bran’s
shoulder,
and
Bran
looked
over
at
his
bastard
brother.
“You
did
well,”
Jon
told
him
solemnly.
Jon
was
fourteen,
an
old
hand
at
justice.

It
seemed
colder
on
the
long
ride
back
to
Winterfell,
though
the
wind
had
died
by
then
and
the
sun
was
higher
in
the
sky.
Bran
rode
with
his
brothers,
well
ahead
of
the
main
party,
his
pony
struggling
hard
to
keep
up
with
their
horses.

“The
deserter
died
bravely,”
Robb
said.
He
was
big
and
broad
and
growing
every
day,
with
his
mother’s
coloring,
the
fair
skin,
red-brown
hair,
and
blue
eyes
of
the
Tullys
of
Riverrun.
“He
had
courage,
at
the
least.”

“No,”
Jon
Snow
said
quietly.
“It
was
not
courage.
This
one
was
dead
of
fear.
You
could
see
it
in
his
eyes,
Stark.”
Jon’s
eyes
were
a
grey
so
dark
they
seemed
almost
black,
but
there
was
little
they
did
not
see.
He
was
of
an
age
with
Robb,
but
they
did
not
look
alike.
Jon
was
slender
where
Robb
was
muscular,
dark
where
Robb
was
fair,
graceful
and
quick
where
his
half
brother
was
strong
and
fast.

Robb
was
not
impressed.
“The
Others
take
his
eyes,”
he
swore.
“He
died
well.
Race
you
to
the
bridge?”

“Done,”
Jon
said,
kicking
his
horse
forward.
Robb
cursed
and
followed,
and
they
galloped
off
down
the
trail,
Robb
laughing
and
hooting,
Jon
silent
and
intent.
The
hooves
of
their
horses
kicked
up
showers
of
snow
as
they
went.

Bran
did
not
try
to
follow.
His
pony
could
not
keep
up.
He
had
seen
the
ragged
man’s
eyes,
and
he
was
thinking
of
them
now.
After
a
while,
the
sound
of
Robb’s
laughter
receded,
and
the
woods
grew
silent
again.

So
deep
in
thought
was
he
that
he
never
heard
the
rest
of
the
party
until
his
father
moved
up
to
ride
beside
him.
“Are
you
well,
Bran?”
he
asked,
not
unkindly.

“Yes,
Father,”
Bran
told
him.
He
looked
up.
Wrapped
in
his
furs
and
leathers,
mounted
on
his
great
warhorse,
his
lord
father
loomed
over
him
like
a
giant.
“Robb
says
the
man
died
bravely,
but
Jon
says
he
was
afraid.”

“What
do
you
think?”
his
father
asked.

Bran
thought
about
it.
“Can
a
man
still
be
brave
if
he’s
afraid?”

“That
is
the
only
time
a
man
can
be
brave,”
his
father
told
him.
“Do
you
understand
why
I
did
it?”

“He
was
a
wildling,”
Bran
said.
“They
carry
off
women
and
sell
them
to
the
Others.”

His
lord
father
smiled.
“Old
Nan
has
been
telling
you
stories
again.
In
truth,
the
man
was
an
oathbreaker,
a
deserter
from
the
Night’s
Watch.
No
man
is
more
dangerous.
The
deserter
knows
his
life
is
forfeit
if
he
is
taken,
so
he
will
not
flinch
from
any
crime,
no
matter
how
vile.
But
you
mistake
me.
The
question
was
not
why
the
man
had
to
die,
but
why
I
must
do
it.”

Bran
had
no
answer
for
that.
“King
Robert
has
a
headsman,”
he
said,
uncertainly.

“He
does,”
his
father
admitted.
“As
did
the
Targaryen
kings
before
him.
Yet
our
way
is
the
older
way.
The
blood
of
the
First
Men
still
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks,
and
we
hold
to
the
belief
that
the
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
sword.
If
you
would
take
a
man’s
life,
you
owe
it
to
him
to
look
into
his
eyes
and
hear
his
final
words.
And
if
you
cannot
bear
to
do
that,
then
perhaps
the
man
does
not
deserve
to
die.

“One
day,
Bran,
you
will
be
Robb’s
bannerman,
holding
a
keep
of
your
own
for
your
brother
and
your
king,
and
justice
will
fall
to
you.
When
that
day
comes,
you
must
take
no
pleasure
in
the
task,
but
neither
must
you
look
away.
A
ruler
who
hides
behind
paid
executioners
soon
forgets
what
death
is.”

That
was
when
Jon
reappeared
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
before
them.
He
waved
and
shouted
down
at
them.
“Father,
Bran,
come
quickly,
see
what
Robb
has
found!”
Then
he
was
gone
again.

Jory
rode
up
beside
them.
“Trouble,
my
lord?”

“Beyond
a
doubt,”
his
lord
father
said.
“Come,
let
us
see
what
mischief
my
sons
have
rooted
out
now.”
He
sent
his
horse
into
a
trot.
Jory
and
Bran
and
the
rest
came
after.

They
found
Robb
on
the
riverbank
north
of
the
bridge,
with
Jon
still
mounted
beside
him.
The
late
summer
snows
had
been
heavy
this
moonturn.
Robb
stood
knee-deep
in
white,
his
hood
pulled
back
so
the
sun
shone
in
his
hair.
He
was
cradling
something
in
his
arm,
while
the
boys
talked
in
hushed,
excited
voices.

The
riders
picked
their
way
carefully
through
the
drifts,
groping
for
solid
footing
on
the
hidden,
uneven
ground.
Jory
Cassel
and
Theon
Greyjoy
were
the
first
to
reach
the
boys.
Greyjoy
was
laughing
and
joking
as
he
rode.
Bran
heard
the
breath
go
out
of
him.
“Gods!”
he
exclaimed,
struggling
to
keep
control
of
his
horse
as
he
reached
for
his
sword.

Jory’s
sword
was
already
out.
“Robb,
get
away
from
it!”
he
called
as
his
horse
reared
under
him.

Robb
grinned
and
looked
up
from
the
bundle
in
his
arms.
“She
can’t
hurt
you,”
he
said.
“She’s
dead,
Jory.”

Bran
was
afire
with
curiosity
by
then.
He
would
have
spurred
the
pony
faster,
but
his
father
made
them
dismount
beside
the
bridge
and
approach
on
foot.
Bran
jumped
off
and
ran.

By
then
Jon,
Jory,
and
Theon
Greyjoy
had
all
dismounted
as
well.
“What
in
the
seven
hells
is
it?”
Greyjoy
was
saying.

“A
wolf,”
Robb
told
him.

“A
freak,”
Greyjoy
said.
“Look
at
the
size
of
it.”

Bran’s
heart
was
thumping
in
his
chest
as
he
pushed
through
a
waist-high
drift
to
his
brothers’
side.

Half-buried
in
bloodstained
snow,
a
huge
dark
shape
slumped
in
death.
Ice
had
formed
in
its
shaggy
grey
fur,
and
the
faint
smell
of
corruption
clung
to
it
like
a
woman’s
perfume.
Bran
glimpsed
blind
eyes
crawling
with
maggots,
a
wide
mouth
full
of
yellowed
teeth.
But
it
was
the
size
of
it
that
made
him
gasp.
It
was
bigger
than
his
pony,
twice
the
size
of
the
largest
hound
in
his
father’s
kennel.

“It’s
no
freak,”
Jon
said
calmly.
“That’s
a
direwolf.
They
grow
larger
than
the
other
kind.”

Theon
Greyjoy
said,
“There’s
not
been
a
direwolf
sighted
south
of
the
Wall
in
two
hundred
years.”

“I
see
one
now,”
Jon
replied.

Bran
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
monster.
That
was
when
he
noticed
the
bundle
in
Robb’s
arms.
He
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
moved
closer.
The
pup
was
a
tiny
ball
of
grey-black
fur,
its
eyes
still
closed.
It
nuzzled
blindly
against
Robb’s
chest
as
he
cradled
it,
searching
for
milk
among
his
leathers,
making
a
sad
little
whimpery
sound.
Bran
reached
out
hesitantly.
“Go
on,”
Robb
told
him.
“You
can
touch
him.”

Bran
gave
the
pup
a
quick
nervous
stroke,
then
turned
as
Jon
said,
“Here
you
go.”
His
half
brother
put
a
second
pup
into
his
arms.
“There
are
five
of
them.”
Bran
sat
down
in
the
snow
and
hugged
the
wolf
pup
to
his
face.
Its
fur
was
soft
and
warm
against
his
cheek.

“Direwolves
loose
in
the
realm,
after
so
many
years,”
muttered
Hullen,
the
master
of
horse.
“I
like
it
not.”

“It
is
a
sign,”
Jory
said.

Father
frowned.
“This
is
only
a
dead
animal,
Jory,”
he
said.
Yet
he
seemed
troubled.
Snow
crunched
under
his
boots
as
he
moved
around
the
body.
“Do
we
know
what
killed
her?”

“There’s
something
in
the
throat,”
Robb
told
him,
proud
to
have
found
the
answer
before
his
father
even
asked.
“There,
just
under
the
jaw.”

His
father
knelt
and
groped
under
the
beast’s
head
with
his
hand.
He
gave
a
yank
and
held
it
up
for
all
to
see.
A
foot
of
shattered
antler,
tines
snapped
off,
all
wet
with
blood.

A
sudden
silence
descended
over
the
party.
The
men
looked
at
the
antler
uneasily,
and
no
one
dared
to
speak.
Even
Bran
could
sense
their
fear,
though
he
did
not
understand.

His
father
tossed
the
antler
to
the
side
and
cleansed
his
hands
in
the
snow.
“I’m
surprised
she
lived
long
enough
to
whelp,”
he
said.
His
voice
broke
the
spell.

“Maybe
she
didn’t,”
Jory
said.
“I’ve
heard
tales…
maybe
the
bitch
was
already
dead
when
the
pups
came.”

“Born
with
the
dead,”
another
man
put
in.
“Worse
luck.”

“No
matter,”
said
Hullen.
“They
be
dead
soon
enough
too.”

Bran
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
dismay.

“The
sooner
the
better,”
Theon
Greyjoy
agreed.
He
drew
his
sword.
“Give
the
beast
here,
Bran.”

The
little
thing
squirmed
against
him,
as
if
it
heard
and
understood.
“No!”
Bran
cried
out
fiercely.
“It’s
mine.”

“Put
away
your
sword,
Greyjoy,”
Robb
said.
For
a
moment
he
sounded
as
commanding
as
their
father,
like
the
lord
he
would
someday
be.
“We
will
keep
these
pups.”

“You
cannot
do
that,
boy,”
said
Harwin,
who
was
Hullen’s
son.

“It
be
a
mercy
to
kill
them,”
Hullen
said.

Bran
looked
to
his
lord
father
for
rescue,
but
got
only
a
frown,
a
furrowed
brow.
“Hullen
speaks
truly,
son.
Better
a
swift
death
than
a
hard
one
from
cold
and
starvation.”

“No!”
He
could
feel
tears
welling
in
his
eyes,
and
he
looked
away.
He
did
not
want
to
cry
in
front
of
his
father.

Robb
resisted
stubbornly.
“Ser
Rodrik’s
red
bitch
whelped
again
last
week,”
he
said.
“It
was
a
small
litter,
only
two
live
pups.
She’ll
have
milk
enough.”

“She’ll
rip
them
apart
when
they
try
to
nurse.”

“Lord
Stark,”
Jon
said.
It
was
strange
to
hear
him
call
Father
that,
so
formal.
Bran
looked
at
him
with
desperate
hope.
“There
are
five
pups,”
he
told
Father.
“Three
male,
two
female.”

“What
of
it,
Jon?”

“You
have
five
trueborn
children,”
Jon
said.
“Three
sons,
two
daughters.
The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
your
House.
Your
children
were
meant
to
have
these
pups,
my
lord.”

Bran
saw
his
father’s
face
change,
saw
the
other
men
exchange
glances.
He
loved
Jon
with
all
his
heart
at
that
moment.
Even
at
seven,
Bran
understood
what
his
brother
had
done.
The
count
had
come
right
only
because
Jon
had
omitted
himself.
He
had
included
the
girls,
included
even
Rickon,
the
baby,
but
not
the
bastard
who
bore
the
surname
Snow,
the
name
that
custom
decreed
be
given
to
all
those
in
the
north
unlucky
enough
to
be
born
with
no
name
of
their
own.

Their
father
understood
as
well.
“You
want
no
pup
for
yourself,
Jon?”
he
asked
softly.

“The
direwolf
graces
the
banners
of
House
Stark,”
Jon
pointed
out.
“I
am
no
Stark,
Father.”

Their
lord
father
regarded
Jon
thoughtfully.
Robb
rushed
into
the
silence
he
left.
“I
will
nurse
him
myself,
Father,”
he
promised.
“I
will
soak
a
towel
with
warm
milk,
and
give
him
suck
from
that.”

“Me
too!”
Bran
echoed.

The
lord
weighed
his
sons
long
and
carefully
with
his
eyes.
“Easy
to
say,
and
harder
to
do.
I
will
not
have
you
wasting
the
servants’
time
with
this.
If
you
want
these
pups,
you
will
feed
them
yourselves.
Is
that
understood?”

Bran
nodded
eagerly.
The
pup
squirmed
in
his
grasp,
licked
at
his
face
with
a
warm
tongue.

“You
must
train
them
as
well,”
their
father
said.
“You
must
train
them.
The
kennelmaster
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
monsters,
I
promise
you
that.
And
the
gods
help
you
if
you
neglect
them,
or
brutalize
them,
or
train
them
badly.
These
are
not
dogs
to
beg
for
treats
and
slink
off
at
a
kick.
A
direwolf
will
rip
a
man’s
arm
off
his
shoulder
as
easily
as
a
dog
will
kill
a
rat.
Are
you
sure
you
want
this?”

“Yes,
Father,”
Bran
said.

“Yes,”
Robb
agreed.

“The
pups
may
die
anyway,
despite
all
you
do.”

“They
won’t
die,”
Robb
said.
“We
won’t
let
them
die.”

“Keep
them,
then.
Jory,
Desmond,
gather
up
the
other
pups.
It’s
time
we
were
back
to
Winterfell.”

It
was
not
until
they
were
mounted
and
on
their
way
that
Bran
allowed
himself
to
taste
the
sweet
air
of
victory.
By
then,
his
pup
was
snuggled
inside
his
leathers,
warm
against
him,
safe
for
the
long
ride
home.
Bran
was
wondering
what
to
name
him.

Halfway
across
the
bridge,
Jon
pulled
up
suddenly.

“What
is
it,
Jon?”
their
lord
father
asked.

“Can’t
you
hear
it?”

Bran
could
hear
the
wind
in
the
trees,
the
clatter
of
their
hooves
on
the
ironwood
planks,
the
whimpering
of
his
hungry
pup,
but
Jon
was
listening
to
something
else.

“There,”
Jon
said.
He
swung
his
horse
around
and
galloped
back
across
the
bridge.
They
watched
him
dismount
where
the
direwolf
lay
dead
in
the
snow,
watched
him
kneel.
A
moment
later
he
was
riding
back
to
them,
smiling.

“He
must
have
crawled
away
from
the
others,”
Jon
said.

“Or
been
driven
away,”
their
father
said,
looking
at
the
sixth
pup.
His
fur
was
white,
where
the
rest
of
the
litter
was
grey.
His
eyes
were
as
red
as
the
blood
of
the
ragged
man
who
had
died
that
morning.
Bran
thought
it
curious
that
this
pup
alone
would
have
opened
his
eyes
while
the
others
were
still
blind.

“An
albino,”
Theon
Greyjoy
said
with
wry
amusement.
“This
one
will
die
even
faster
than
the
others.”

Jon
Snow
gave
his
father’s
ward
a
long,
chilling
look.
“I
think
not,
Greyjoy,”
he
said.
“This
one
belongs
to
me.”





CATELYN

Catelyn
had
never
liked
this
godswood.

She
had
been
born
a
Tully,
at
Riverrun
far
to
the
south,
on
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident.
The
godswood
there
was
a
garden,
bright
and
airy,
where
tall
redwoods
spread
dappled
shadows
across
tinkling
streams,
birds
sang
from
hidden
nests,
and
the
air
was
spicy
with
the
scent
of
flowers.

The
gods
of
Winterfell
kept
a
different
sort
of
wood.
It
was
a
dark,
primal
place,
three
acres
of
old
forest
untouched
for
ten
thousand
years
as
the
gloomy
castle
rose
around
it.
It
smelled
of
moist
earth
and
decay.
No
redwoods
grew
here.
This
was
a
wood
of
stubborn
sentinel
trees
armored
in
grey-green
needles,
of
mighty
oaks,
of
ironwoods
as
old
as
the
realm
itself.
Here
thick
black
trunks
crowded
close
together
while
twisted
branches
wove
a
dense
canopy
overhead
and
misshappen
roots
wrestled
beneath
the
soil.
This
was
a
place
of
deep
silence
and
brooding
shadows,
and
the
gods
who
lived
here
had
no
names.

But
she
knew
she
would
find
her
husband
here
tonight.
Whenever
he
took
a
man’s
life,
afterward
he
would
seek
the
quiet
of
the
godswood.

Catelyn
had
been
anointed
with
the
seven
oils
and
named
in
the
rainbow
of
light
that
filled
the
sept
of
Riverrun.
She
was
of
the
Faith,
like
her
father
and
grandfather
and
his
father
before
him.
Her
gods
had
names,
and
their
faces
were
as
familiar
as
the
faces
of
her
parents.
Worship
was
a
septon
with
a
censer,
the
smell
of
incense,
a
seven-sided
crystal
alive
with
light,
voices
raised
in
song.
The
Tullys
kept
a
godswood,
as
all
the
great
houses
did,
but
it
was
only
a
place
to
walk
or
read
or
lie
in
the
sun.
Worship
was
for
the
sept.

For
her
sake,
Ned
had
built
a
small
sept
where
she
might
sing
to
the
seven
faces
of
god,
but
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
still
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks,
and
his
own
gods
were
the
old
ones,
the
nameless,
faceless
gods
of
the
greenwood
they
shared
with
the
vanished
children
of
the
forest.

At
the
center
of
the
grove
an
ancient
weirwood
brooded
over
a
small
pool
where
the
waters
were
black
and
cold.
“The
heart
tree,”
Ned
called
it.
The
weirwood’s
bark
was
white
as
bone,
its
leaves
dark
red,
like
a
thousand
bloodstained
hands.
A
face
had
been
carved
in
the
trunk
of
the
great
tree,
its
features
long
and
melancholy,
the
deep-cut
eyes
red
with
dried
sap
and
strangely
watchful.
They
were
old,
those
eyes;
older
than
Winterfell
itself.
They
had
seen
Brandon
the
Builder
set
the
first
stone,
if
the
tales
were
true;
they
had
watched
the
castle’s
granite
walls
rise
around
them.
It
was
said
that
the
children
of
the
forest
had
carved
the
faces
in
the
trees
during
the
dawn
centuries
before
the
coming
of
the
First
Men
across
the
narrow
sea.

In
the
south
the
last
weirwoods
had
been
cut
down
or
burned
out
a
thousand
years
ago,
except
on
the
Isle
of
Faces
where
the
green
men
kept
their
silent
watch.
Up
here
it
was
different.
Here
every
castle
had
its
godswood,
and
every
godswood
had
its
heart
tree,
and
every
heart
tree
its
face.

Catelyn
found
her
husband
beneath
the
weirwood,
seated
on
a
moss-covered
stone.
The
greatsword
Ice
was
across
his
lap,
and
he
was
cleaning
the
blade
in
those
waters
black
as
night.
A
thousand
years
of
humus
lay
thick
upon
the
godswood
floor,
swallowing
the
sound
of
her
feet,
but
the
red
eyes
of
the
weirwood
seemed
to
follow
her
as
she
came.
“Ned,”
she
called
softly.

He
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
her.
“Catelyn,”
he
said.
His
voice
was
distant
and
formal.
“Where
are
the
children?”

He
would
always
ask
her
that.
“In
the
kitchen,
arguing
about
names
for
the
wolf
pups.”
She
spread
her
cloak
on
the
forest
floor
and
sat
beside
the
pool,
her
back
to
the
weirwood.
She
could
feel
the
eyes
watching
her,
but
she
did
her
best
to
ignore
them.
“Arya
is
already
in
love,
and
Sansa
is
charmed
and
gracious,
but
Rickon
is
not
quite
sure.”

“Is
he
afraid?”
Ned
asked.

“A
little,”
she
admitted.
“He
is
only
three.”

Ned
frowned.
“He
must
learn
to
face
his
fears.
He
will
not
be
three
forever.
And
winter
is
coming.”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
agreed.
The
words
gave
her
a
chill,
as
they
always
did.
The
Stark
words.
Every
noble
house
had
its
words.
Family
mottoes,
touchstones,
prayers
of
sorts,
they
boasted
of
honor
and
glory,
promised
loyalty
and
truth,
swore
faith
and
courage.
All
but
the
Starks.
Winter
is
coming,
said
the
Stark
words.
Not
for
the
first
time,
she
reflected
on
what
a
strange
people
these
northerners
were.

“The
man
died
well,
I’ll
give
him
that,”
Ned
said.
He
had
a
swatch
of
oiled
leather
in
one
hand.
He
ran
it
lightly
up
the
greatsword
as
he
spoke,
polishing
the
metal
to
a
dark
glow.
“I
was
glad
for
Bran’s
sake.
You
would
have
been
proud
of
Bran.”

“I
am
always
proud
of
Bran,”
Catelyn
replied,
watching
the
sword
as
he
stroked
it.
She
could
see
the
rippling
deep
within
the
steel,
where
the
metal
had
been
folded
back
on
itself
a
hundred
times
in
the
forging.
Catelyn
had
no
love
for
swords,
but
she
could
not
deny
that
Ice
had
its
own
beauty.
It
had
been
forged
in
Valyria,
before
the
Doom
had
come
to
the
old
Freehold,
when
the
ironsmiths
had
worked
their
metal
with
spells
as
well
as
hammers.
Four
hundred
years
old
it
was,
and
as
sharp
as
the
day
it
was
forged.
The
name
it
bore
was
older
still,
a
legacy
from
the
age
of
heroes,
when
the
Starks
were
Kings
in
the
North.

“He
was
the
fourth
this
year,”
Ned
said
grimly.
“The
poor
man
was
half-mad.
Something
had
put
a
fear
in
him
so
deep
that
my
words
could
not
reach
him.”
He
sighed.
“Ben
writes
that
the
strength
of
the
Night’s
Watch
is
down
below
a
thousand.
It’s
not
only
desertions.
They
are
losing
men
on
rangings
as
well.”

“Is
it
the
wildlings?”
she
asked.

“Who
else?”
Ned
lifted
Ice,
looked
down
the
cool
steel
length
of
it.
“And
it
will
only
grow
worse.
The
day
may
come
when
I
will
have
no
choice
but
to
call
the
banners
and
ride
north
to
deal
with
this
King-beyond-the-Wall
for
good
and
all.”

“Beyond
the
Wall?”
The
thought
made
Catelyn
shudder.

Ned
saw
the
dread
on
her
face.
“Mance
Rayder
is
nothing
for
us
to
fear.”

“There
are
darker
things
beyond
the
Wall.”
She
glanced
behind
her
at
the
heart
tree,
the
pale
bark
and
red
eyes,
watching,
listening,
thinking
its
long
slow
thoughts.

His
smile
was
gentle.
“You
listen
to
too
many
of
Old
Nan’s
stories.
The
Others
are
as
dead
as
the
children
of
the
forest,
gone
eight
thousand
years.
Maester
Luwin
will
tell
you
they
never
lived
at
all.
No
living
man
has
ever
seen
one.”

“Until
this
morning,
no
living
man
had
ever
seen
a
direwolf
either,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

“I
ought
to
know
better
than
to
argue
with
a
Tully,”
he
said
with
a
rueful
smile.
He
slid
Ice
back
into
its
sheath.
“You
did
not
come
here
to
tell
me
crib
tales.
I
know
how
little
you
like
this
place.
What
is
it,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
took
her
husband’s
hand.
“There
was
grievous
news
today,
my
lord.
I
did
not
wish
to
trouble
you
until
you
had
cleansed
yourself.”
There
was
no
way
to
soften
the
blow,
so
she
told
him
straight.
“I
am
so
sorry,
my
love.
Jon
Arryn
is
dead.”

His
eyes
found
hers,
and
she
could
see
how
hard
it
took
him,
as
she
had
known
it
would.
In
his
youth,
Ned
had
fostered
at
the
Eyrie,
and
the
childless
Lord
Arryn
had
become
a
second
father
to
him
and
his
fellow
ward,
Robert
Baratheon.
When
the
Mad
King
Aerys
II
Targaryen
had
demanded
their
heads,
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
had
raised
his
moon-and-falcon
banners
in
revolt
rather
than
give
up
those
he
had
pledged
to
protect.

And
one
day
fifteen
years
ago,
this
second
father
had
become
a
brother
as
well,
as
he
and
Ned
stood
together
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun
to
wed
two
sisters,
the
daughters
of
Lord
Hoster
Tully.

“Jon…”
he
said.
“Is
this
news
certain?”

“It
was
the
king’s
seal,
and
the
letter
is
in
Robert’s
own
hand.
I
saved
it
for
you.
He
said
Lord
Arryn
was
taken
quickly.
Even
Maester
Pycelle
was
helpless,
but
he
brought
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
so
Jon
did
not
linger
long
in
pain.”

“That
is
some
small
mercy,
I
suppose,”
he
said.
She
could
see
the
grief
on
his
face,
but
even
then
he
thought
first
of
her.
“Your
sister,”
he
said.
“And
Jon’s
boy.
What
word
of
them?”

“The
message
said
only
that
they
were
well,
and
had
returned
to
the
Eyrie,”
Catelyn
said.
“I
wish
they
had
gone
to
Riverrun
instead.
The
Eyrie
is
high
and
lonely,
and
it
was
ever
her
husband’s
place,
not
hers.
Lord
Jon’s
memory
will
haunt
each
stone.
I
know
my
sister.
She
needs
the
comfort
of
family
and
friends
around
her.”

“Your
uncle
waits
in
the
Vale,
does
he
not?
Jon
named
him
Knight
of
the
Gate,
I’d
heard.”

Catelyn
nodded.
“Brynden
will
do
what
he
can
for
her,
and
for
the
boy.
That
is
some
comfort,
but
still…”

“Go
to
her,”
Ned
urged.
“Take
the
children.
Fill
her
halls
with
noise
and
shouts
and
laughter.
That
boy
of
hers
needs
other
children
about
him,
and
Lysa
should
not
be
alone
in
her
grief.”

“Would
that
I
could,”
Catelyn
said.
“The
letter
had
other
tidings.
The
king
is
riding
to
Winterfell
to
seek
you
out.”

It
took
Ned
a
moment
to
comprehend
her
words,
but
when
the
understanding
came,
the
darkness
left
his
eyes.
“Robert
is
coming
here?”
When
she
nodded,
a
smile
broke
across
his
face.

Catelyn
wished
she
could
share
his
joy.
But
she
had
heard
the
talk
in
the
yards;
a
direwolf
dead
in
the
snow,
a
broken
antler
in
its
throat.
Dread
coiled
within
her
like
a
snake,
but
she
forced
herself
to
smile
at
this
man
she
loved,
this
man
who
put
no
faith
in
signs.
“I
knew
that
would
please
you,”
she
said.
“We
should
send
word
to
your
brother
on
the
Wall.”

“Yes,
of
course,”
he
agreed.
“Ben
will
want
to
be
here.
I
shall
tell
Maester
Luwin
to
send
his
swiftest
bird.”
Ned
rose
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet.
“Damnation,
how
many
years
has
it
been?
And
he
gives
us
no
more
notice
than
this?
How
many
in
his
party,
did
the
message
say?”

“I
should
think
a
hundred
knights,
at
the
least,
with
all
their
retainers,
and
half
again
as
many
freeriders.
Cersei
and
the
children
travel
with
them.”

“Robert
will
keep
an
easy
pace
for
their
sakes,”
he
said.
“It
is
just
as
well.
That
will
give
us
more
time
to
prepare.”

“The
queen’s
brothers
are
also
in
the
party,”
she
told
him.

Ned
grimaced
at
that.
There
was
small
love
between
him
and
the
queen’s
family,
Catelyn
knew.
The
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock
had
come
late
to
Robert’s
cause,
when
victory
was
all
but
certain,
and
he
had
never
forgiven
them.
“Well,
if
the
price
for
Robert’s
company
is
an
infestation
of
Lannisters,
so
be
it.
It
sounds
as
though
Robert
is
bringing
half
his
court.”

“Where
the
king
goes,
the
realm
follows,”
she
said.

“It
will
be
good
to
see
the
children.
The
youngest
was
still
sucking
at
the
Lannister
woman’s
teat
the
last
time
I
saw
him.
He
must
be,
what,
five
by
now?”

“Prince
Tommen
is
seven,”
she
told
him.
“The
same
age
as
Bran.
Please,
Ned,
guard
your
tongue.
The
Lannister
woman
is
our
queen,
and
her
pride
is
said
to
grow
with
every
passing
year.”

Ned
squeezed
her
hand.
“There
must
be
a
feast,
of
course,
with
singers,
and
Robert
will
want
to
hunt.
I
shall
send
Jory
south
with
an
honor
guard
to
meet
them
on
the
kingsroad
and
escort
them
back.
Gods,
how
are
we
going
to
feed
them
all?
On
his
way
already,
you
said?
Damn
the
man.
Damn
his
royal
hide.”





DAENERYS

Her
brother
held
the
gown
up
for
her
inspection.
“This
is
beauty.
Touch
it.
Go
on.
Caress
the
fabric.”

Dany
touched
it.
The
cloth
was
so
smooth
that
it
seemed
to
run
through
her
fingers
like
water.
She
could
not
remember
ever
wearing
anything
so
soft.
It
frightened
her.
She
pulled
her
hand
away.
“Is
it
really
mine?”

“A
gift
from
the
Magister
Illyrio,”
Viserys
said,
smiling.
Her
brother
was
in
a
high
mood
tonight.
“The
color
will
bring
out
the
violet
in
your
eyes.
And
you
shall
have
gold
as
well,
and
jewels
of
all
sorts.
Illyrio
has
promised.
Tonight
you
must
look
like
a
princess.”

A
princess,
Dany
thought.
She
had
forgotten
what
that
was
like.
Perhaps
she
had
never
really
known.
“Why
does
he
give
us
so
much?”
she
asked.
“What
does
he
want
from
us?”
For
nigh
on
half
a
year,
they
had
lived
in
the
magister’s
house,
eating
his
food,
pampered
by
his
servants.
Dany
was
thirteen,
old
enough
to
know
that
such
gifts
seldom
come
without
their
price,
here
in
the
free
city
of
Pentos.

“Illyrio
is
no
fool,”
Viserys
said.
He
was
a
gaunt
young
man
with
nervous
hands
and
a
feverish
look
in
his
pale
lilac
eyes.
“The
magister
knows
that
I
will
not
forget
my
friends
when
I
come
into
my
throne.”

Dany
said
nothing.
Magister
Illyrio
was
a
dealer
in
spices,
gemstones,
dragonbone,
and
other,
less
savory
things.
He
had
friends
in
all
of
the
Nine
Free
Cities,
it
was
said,
and
even
beyond,
in
Vaes
Dothrak
and
the
fabled
lands
beside
the
Jade
Sea.
It
was
also
said
that
he’d
never
had
a
friend
he
wouldn’t
cheerfully
sell
for
the
right
price.
Dany
listened
to
the
talk
in
the
streets,
and
she
heard
these
things,
but
she
knew
better
than
to
question
her
brother
when
he
wove
his
webs
of
dream.
His
anger
was
a
terrible
thing
when
roused.
Viserys
called
it
“waking
the
dragon.”

Her
brother
hung
the
gown
beside
the
door.
“Illyrio
will
send
the
slaves
to
bathe
you.
Be
sure
you
wash
off
the
stink
of
the
stables.
Khal
Drogo
has
a
thousand
horses,
tonight
he
looks
for
a
different
sort
of
mount.”
He
studied
her
critically.
“You
still
slouch.
Straighten
yourself”
He
pushed
back
her
shoulders
with
his
hands.
“Let
them
see
that
you
have
a
woman’s
shape
now.”
His
fingers
brushed
lightly
over
her
budding
breasts
and
tightened
on
a
nipple.
“You
will
not
fail
me
tonight.
If
you
do,
it
will
go
hard
for
you.
You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”
His
fingers
twisted
her,
the
pinch
cruelly
hard
through
the
rough
fabric
of
her
tunic.
“Do
you?”
he
repeated.

“No,”
Dany
said
meekly.

Her
brother
smiled.
“Good.”
He
touched
her
hair,
almost
with
affection.
“When
they
write
the
history
of
my
reign,
sweet
sister,
they
will
say
that
it
began
tonight.”

When
he
was
gone,
Dany
went
to
her
window
and
looked
out
wistfully
on
the
waters
of
the
bay.
The
square
brick
towers
of
Pentos
were
black
silhouettes
outlined
against
the
setting
sun.
Dany
could
hear
the
singing
of
the
red
priests
as
they
lit
their
night
fires
and
the
shouts
of
ragged
children
playing
games
beyond
the
walls
of
the
estate.
For
a
moment
she
wished
she
could
be
out
there
with
them,
barefoot
and
breathless
and
dressed
in
tatters,
with
no
past
and
no
future
and
no
feast
to
attend
at
Khal
Drogo’s
manse.

Somewhere
beyond
the
sunset,
across
the
narrow
sea,
lay
a
land
of
green
hills
and
flowered
plains
and
great
rushing
rivers,
where
towers
of
dark
stone
rose
amidst
magnificent
blue-grey
mountains,
and
armored
knights
rode
to
battle
beneath
the
banners
of
their
lords.
The
Dothraki
called
that
land
Rhaesh
Andahli,
the
land
of
the
Andals.
In
the
Free
Cities,
they
talked
of
Westeros
and
the
Sunset
Kingdoms.
Her
brother
had
a
simpler
name.
“Our
land,”
he
called
it.
The
words
were
like
a
prayer
with
him.
If
he
said
them
enough,
the
gods
were
sure
to
hear.
“Ours
by
blood
right,
taken
from
us
by
treachery,
but
ours
still,
ours
forever.
You
do
not
steal
from
the
dragon,
oh,
no.
The
dragon
remembers.”

And
perhaps
the
dragon
did
remember,
but
Dany
could
not.
She
had
never
seen
this
land
her
brother
said
was
theirs,
this
realm
beyond
the
narrow
sea.
These
places
he
talked
of,
Casterly
Rock
and
the
Eyrie,
Highgarden
and
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
Dorne
and
the
Isle
of
Faces,
they
were
just
words
to
her.
Viserys
had
been
a
boy
of
eight
when
they
fled
King’s
Landing
to
escape
the
advancing
armies
of
the
Usurper,
but
Daenerys
had
been
only
a
quickening
in
their
mother’s
womb.

Yet
sometimes
Dany
would
picture
the
way
it
had
been,
so
often
had
her
brother
told
her
the
stories.
The
midnight
flight
to
Dragonstone,
moonlight
shimmering
on
the
ship’s
black
sails.
Her
brother
Rhaegar
battling
the
Usurper
in
the
bloody
waters
of
the
Trident
and
dying
for
the
woman
he
loved.
The
sack
of
King’s
Landing
by
the
ones
Viserys
called
the
Usurper’s
dogs,
the
lords
Lannister
and
Stark.
Princess
Elia
of
Dorne
pleading
for
mercy
as
Rhaegar’s
heir
was
ripped
from
her
breast
and
murdered
before
her
eyes.
The
polished
skulls
of
the
last
dragons
staring
down
sightlessly
from
the
walls
of
the
throne
room
while
the
Kingslayer
opened
Father’s
throat
with
a
golden
sword.

She
had
been
born
on
Dragonstone
nine
moons
after
their
flight,
while
a
raging
summer
storm
threatened
to
rip
the
island
fastness
apart.
They
said
that
storm
was
terrible.
The
Targaryen
fleet
was
smashed
while
it
lay
at
anchor,
and
huge
stone
blocks
were
ripped
from
the
parapets
and
sent
hurtling
into
the
wild
waters
of
the
narrow
sea.
Her
mother
had
died
birthing
her,
and
for
that
her
brother
Viserys
had
never
forgiven
her.

She
did
not
remember
Dragonstone
either.
They
had
run
again,
just
before
the
Usurper’s
brother
set
sail
with
his
new-built
fleet.
By
then
only
Dragonstone
itself,
the
ancient
seat
of
their
House,
had
remained
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
that
had
once
been
theirs.
It
would
not
remain
for
long.
The
garrison
had
been
prepared
to
sell
them
to
the
Usurper,
but
one
night
Ser
Willem
Darry
and
four
loyal
men
had
broken
into
the
nursery
and
stolen
them
both,
along
with
her
wet
nurse,
and
set
sail
under
cover
of
darkness
for
the
safety
of
the
Braavosian
coast.

She
remembered
Ser
Willem
dimly,
a
great
grey
bear
of
a
man,
half-blind,
roaring
and
bellowing
orders
from
his
sickbed.
The
servants
had
lived
in
terror
of
him,
but
he
had
always
been
kind
to
Dany.
He
called
her
“Little
Princess”
and
sometimes
“My
Lady,”
and
his
hands
were
soft
as
old
leather.
He
never
left
his
bed,
though,
and
the
smell
of
sickness
clung
to
him
day
and
night,
a
hot,
moist,
sickly
sweet
odor.
That
was
when
they
lived
in
Braavos,
in
the
big
house
with
the
red
door.
Dany
had
her
own
room
there,
with
a
lemon
tree
outside
her
window.
After
Ser
Willem
had
died,
the
servants
had
stolen
what
little
money
they
had
left,
and
soon
after
they
had
been
put
out
of
the
big
house.
Dany
had
cried
when
the
red
door
closed
behind
them
forever.

They
had
wandered
since
then,
from
Braavos
to
Myr,
from
Myr
to
Tyrosh,
and
on
to
Qohor
and
Volantis
and
Lys,
never
staying
long
in
any
one
place.
Her
brother
would
not
allow
it.
The
Usurper’s
hired
knives
were
close
behind
them,
he
insisted,
though
Dany
had
never
seen
one.

At
first
the
magisters
and
archons
and
merchant
princes
were
pleased
to
welcome
the
last
Targaryens
to
their
homes
and
tables,
but
as
the
years
passed
and
the
Usurper
continued
to
sit
upon
the
Iron
Throne,
doors
closed
and
their
lives
grew
meaner.
Years
past
they
had
been
forced
to
sell
their
last
few
treasures,
and
now
even
the
coin
they
had
gotten
from
Mother’s
crown
had
gone.
In
the
alleys
and
wine
sinks
of
Pentos,
they
called
her
brother
“the
beggar
king.”
Dany
did
not
want
to
know
what
they
called
her.

“We
will
have
it
all
back
someday,
sweet
sister,”
he
would
promise
her.
Sometimes
his
hands
shook
when
he
talked
about
it.
“The
jewels
and
the
silks,
Dragonstone
and
King’s
Landing,
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
all
they
have
taken
from
us,
we
will
have
it
back.”
Viserys
lived
for
that
day.
All
that
Daenerys
wanted
back
was
the
big
house
with
the
red
door,
the
lemon
tree
outside
her
window,
the
childhood
she
had
never
known.

There
came
a
soft
knock
on
her
door.
“Come,”
Dany
said,
turning
away
from
the
window.
Illyrio’s
servants
entered,
bowed,
and
set
about
their
business.
They
were
slaves,
a
gift
from
one
of
the
magister’s
many
Dothraki
friends.
There
was
no
slavery
in
the
free
city
of
Pentos.
Nonetheless,
they
were
slaves.
The
old
woman,
small
and
grey
as
a
mouse,
never
said
a
word,
but
the
girl
made
up
for
it.
She
was
Illyrio’s
favorite,
a
fair-haired,
blue-eyed
wench
of
sixteen
who
chattered
constantly
as
she
worked.

They
filled
her
bath
with
hot
water
brought
up
from
the
kitchen
and
scented
it
with
fragrant
oils.
The
girl
pulled
the
rough
cotton
tunic
over
Dany’s
head
and
helped
her
into
the
tub.
The
water
was
scalding
hot,
but
Daenerys
did
not
flinch
or
cry
out.
She
liked
the
heat.
It
made
her
feel
clean.
Besides,
her
brother
had
often
told
her
that
it
was
never
too
hot
for
a
Targaryen.
“Ours
is
the
house
of
the
dragon,”
he
would
say.
“The
fire
is
in
our
blood.”

The
old
woman
washed
her
long,
silver-pale
hair
and
gently
combed
out
the
snags,
all
in
silence.
The
girl
scrubbed
her
back
and
her
feet
and
told
her
how
lucky
she
was.
“Drogo
is
so
rich
that
even
his
slaves
wear
golden
collars.
A
hundred
thousand
men
ride
in
his
khalasar,
and
his
palace
in
Vaes
Dothrak
has
two
hundred
rooms
and
doors
of
solid
silver.”
There
was
more
like
that,
so
much
more,
what
a
handsome
man
the
khal
was,
so
tall
and
fierce,
fearless
in
battle,
the
best
rider
ever
to
mount
a
horse,
a
demon
archer.
Daenerys
said
nothing.
She
had
always
assumed
that
she
would
wed
Viserys
when
she
came
of
age.
For
centuries
the
Targaryens
had
married
brother
to
sister,
since
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
taken
his
sisters
to
bride.
The
line
must
be
kept
pure,
Viserys
had
told
her
a
thousand
times;
theirs
was
the
kingsblood,
the
golden
blood
of
old
Valyria,
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
Dragons
did
not
mate
with
the
beasts
of
the
field,
and
Targaryens
did
not
mingle
their
blood
with
that
of
lesser
men.
Yet
now
Viserys
schemed
to
sell
her
to
a
stranger,
a
barbarian.

When
she
was
clean,
the
slaves
helped
her
from
the
water
and
toweled
her
dry.
The
girl
brushed
her
hair
until
it
shone
like
molten
silver,
while
the
old
woman
anointed
her
with
the
spiceflower
perfume
of
the
Dothraki
plains,
a
dab
on
each
wrist,
behind
her
ears,
on
the
tips
of
her
breasts,
and
one
last
one,
cool
on
her
lips,
down
there
between
her
legs.
They
dressed
her
in
the
wisps
that
Magister
Illyrio
had
sent
up,
and
then
the
gown,
a
deep
plum
silk
to
bring
out
the
violet
in
her
eyes.
The
girl
slid
the
gilded
sandals
onto
her
feet,
while
the
old
woman
fixed
the
tiara
in
her
hair,
and
slid
golden
bracelets
crusted
with
amethysts
around
her
wrists.
Last
of
all
came
the
collar,
a
heavy
golden
torc
emblazoned
with
ancient
Valyrian
glyphs.

“Now
you
look
all
a
princess,”
the
girl
said
breathlessly
when
they
were
done.
Dany
glanced
at
her
image
in
the
silvered
looking
glass
that
Illyrio
had
so
thoughtfully
provided.
A
princess,
she
thought,
but
she
remembered
what
the
girl
had
said,
how
Khal
Drogo
was
so
rich
even
his
slaves
wore
golden
collars.
She
felt
a
sudden
chill,
and
gooseflesh
pimpled
her
bare
arms.

Her
brother
was
waiting
in
the
cool
of
the
entry
hall,
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
pool,
his
hand
trailing
in
the
water.
He
rose
when
she
appeared
and
looked
her
over
critically.
“Stand
there,”
he
told
her.
“Turn
around.
Yes.
Good.
You
look…”

“Regal,”
Magister
Illyrio
said,
stepping
through
an
archway.
He
moved
with
surprising
delicacy
for
such
a
massive
man.
Beneath
loose
garments
of
flame-colored
silk,
rolls
of
fat
jiggled
as
he
walked.
Gemstones
glittered
on
every
finger,
and
his
man
had
oiled
his
forked
yellow
beard
until
it
shone
like
real
gold.
“May
the
Lord
of
Light
shower
you
with
blessings
on
this
most
fortunate
day,
Princess
Daenerys,”
the
magister
said
as
he
took
her
hand.
He
bowed
his
head,
showing
a
thin
glimpse
of
crooked
yellow
teeth
through
the
gold
of
his
beard.
“She
is
a
vision,
Your
Grace,
a
vision,”
he
told
her
brother.
“Drogo
will
be
enraptured.”

“She’s
too
skinny,”
Viserys
said.
His
hair,
the
same
silver-blond
as
hers,
had
been
pulled
back
tightly
behind
his
head
and
fastened
with
a
dragonbone
brooch.
It
was
a
severe
look
that
emphasized
the
hard,
gaunt
lines
of
his
face.
He
rested
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword
that
Illyrio
had
lent
him,
and
said,
“Are
you
sure
that
Khal
Drogo
likes
his
women
this
young?”

“She
has
had
her
blood.
She
is
old
enough
for
the
khal,”
Illyrio
told
him,
not
for
the
first
time.
“Look
at
her.
That
silver-gold
hair,
those
purple
eyes…
she
is
the
blood
of
old
Valyria,
no
doubt,
no
doubt…
and
highborn,
daughter
of
the
old
king,
sister
to
the
new,
she
cannot
fail
to
entrance
our
Drogo.”
When
he
released
her
hand,
Daenerys
found
herself
trembling.

“I
suppose,”
her
brother
said
doubtfully.
“The
savages
have
queer
tastes.
Boys,
horses,
sheep…”

“Best
not
suggest
this
to
Khal
Drogo,”
Illyrio
said.

Anger
flashed
in
her
brother’s
lilac
eyes.
“Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?”

The
magister
bowed
slightly.
“I
take
you
for
a
king.
Kings
lack
the
caution
of
common
men.
My
apologies
if
I
have
given
offense.”
He
turned
away
and
clapped
his
hands
for
his
bearers.

The
streets
of
Pentos
were
pitch-dark
when
they
set
out
in
Illyrio’s
elaborately
carved
palanquin.
Two
servants
went
ahead
to
light
their
way,
carrying
ornate
oil
lanterns
with
panes
of
pale
blue
glass,
while
a
dozen
strong
men
hoisted
the
poles
to
their
shoulders.
It
was
warm
and
close
inside
behind
the
curtains.
Dany
could
smell
the
stench
of
Illyrio’s
pallid
flesh
through
his
heavy
perfumes.

Her
brother,
sprawled
out
on
his
pillows
beside
her,
never
noticed.
His
mind
was
away
across
the
narrow
sea.
“We
won’t
need
his
whole
khalasar,”
Viserys
said.
His
fingers
toyed
with
the
hilt
of
his
borrowed
blade,
though
Dany
knew
he
had
never
used
a
sword
in
earnest.
“Ten
thousand,
that
would
be
enough,
I
could
sweep
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
ten
thousand
Dothraki
screamers.
The
realm
will
rise
for
its
rightful
king.
Tyrell,
Redwyne,
Darry,
Greyjoy,
they
have
no
more
love
for
the
Usurper
than
I
do.
The
Dornishmen
burn
to
avenge
Elia
and
her
children.
And
the
smallfolk
will
be
with
us.
They
cry
out
for
their
king.”
He
looked
at
Illyrio
anxiously.
“They
do,
don’t
they?”

“They
are
your
people,
and
they
love
you
well,”
Magister
Illyrio
said
amiably.
“In
holdfasts
all
across
the
realm,
men
lift
secret
toasts
to
your
health
while
women
sew
dragon
banners
and
hide
them
against
the
day
of
your
return
from
across
the
water.”
He
gave
a
massive
shrug.
“Or
so
my
agents
tell
me.”

Dany
had
no
agents,
no
way
of
knowing
what
anyone
was
doing
or
thinking
across
the
narrow
sea,
but
she
mistrusted
Illyrio’s
sweet
words
as
she
mistrusted
everything
about
Illyrio.
Her
brother
was
nodding
eagerly,
however.
“I
shall
kill
the
Usurper
myself,”
he
promised,
who
had
never
killed
anyone,
“as
he
killed
my
brother
Rhaegar.
And
Lannister
too,
the
Kingslayer,
for
what
he
did
to
my
father.”

“That
would
be
most
fitting,”
Magister
Illyrio
said.
Dany
saw
the
smallest
hint
of
a
smile
playing
around
his
full
lips,
but
her
brother
did
not
notice.
Nodding,
he
pushed
back
a
curtain
and
stared
off
into
the
night,
and
Dany
knew
he
was
fighting
the
Battle
of
the
Trident
once
again.

The
nine-towered
manse
of
Khal
Drogo
sat
beside
the
waters
of
the
bay,
its
high
brick
walls
overgrown
with
pale
ivy.
It
had
been
given
to
the
khal
by
the
magisters
of
Pentos,
Illyrio
told
them.
The
Free
Cities
were
always
generous
with
the
horselords.
“It
is
not
that
we
fear
these
barbarians,”
Illyrio
would
explain
with
a
smile.
“The
Lord
of
Light
would
hold
our
city
walls
against
a
million
Dothraki,
or
so
the
red
priests
promise…
yet
why
take
chances,
when
their
friendship
comes
so
cheap?”

Their
palanquin
was
stopped
at
the
gate,
the
curtains
pulled
roughly
back
by
one
of
the
house
guards.
He
had
the
copper
skin
and
dark
almond
eyes
of
a
Dothraki,
but
his
face
was
hairless
and
he
wore
the
spiked
bronze
cap
of
the
Unsullied.
He
looked
them
over
coldly.
Magister
Illyrio
growled
something
to
him
in
the
rough
Dothraki
tongue;
the
guardsman
replied
in
the
same
voice
and
waved
them
through
the
gates.

Dany
noticed
that
her
brother’s
hand
was
clenched
tightly
around
the
hilt
of
his
borrowed
sword.
He
looked
almost
as
frightened
as
she
felt.
“Insolent
eunuch,”
Viserys
muttered
as
the
palanquin
lurched
up
toward
the
manse.

Magister
Illyrio’s
words
were
honey.
“Many
important
men
will
be
at
the
feast
tonight.
Such
men
have
enemies.
The
khal
must
protect
his
guests,
yourself
chief
among
them,
Your
Grace.
No
doubt
the
Usurper
would
pay
well
for
your
head.”

“Oh,
yes,”
Viserys
said
darkly.
“He
has
tried,
Illyrio,
I
promise
you
that.
His
hired
knives
follow
us
everywhere.
I
am
the
last
dragon,
and
he
will
not
sleep
easy
while
I
live.”

The
palanquin
slowed
and
stopped.
The
curtains
were
thrown
back,
and
a
slave
offered
a
hand
to
help
Daenerys
out.
His
collar,
she
noted,
was
ordinary
bronze.
Her
brother
followed,
one
hand
still
clenched
hard
around
his
sword
hilt.
It
took
two
strong
men
to
get
Magister
Illyrio
back
on
his
feet.

Inside
the
manse,
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
spices,
pinchfire
and
sweet
lemon
and
cinnamon.
They
were
escorted
across
the
entry
hall,
where
a
mosaic
of
colored
glass
depicted
the
Doom
of
Valyria.
Oil
burned
in
black
iron
lanterns
all
along
the
walls.
Beneath
an
arch
of
twining
stone
leaves,
a
eunuch
sang
their
coming.
“Viserys
of
the
House
Targaryen,
the
Third
of
his
Name,”
he
called
in
a
high,
sweet
voice,
“King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
His
sister,
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Princess
of
Dragonstone.
His
honorable
host,
Illyrio
Mopatis,
Magister
of
the
Free
City
of
Pentos.”

They
stepped
past
the
eunuch
into
a
pillared
courtyard
overgrown
in
pale
ivy.
Moonlight
painted
the
leaves
in
shades
of
bone
and
silver
as
the
guests
drifted
among
them.
Many
were
Dothraki
horselords,
big
men
with
red-brown
skin,
their
drooping
mustachios
bound
in
metal
rings,
their
black
hair
oiled
and
braided
and
hung
with
bells.
Yet
among
them
moved
bravos
and
sellswords
from
Pentos
and
Myr
and
Tyrosh,
a
red
priest
even
fatter
than
Illyrio,
hairy
men
from
the
Port
of
Ibben,
and
lords
from
the
Summer
Isles
with
skin
as
black
as
ebony.
Daenerys
looked
at
them
all
in
wonder…
and
realized,
with
a
sudden
start
of
fear,
that
she
was
the
only
woman
there.

Illyrio
whispered
to
them.
“Those
three
are
Drogo’s
bloodriders,
there,”
he
said.
“By
the
pillar
is
Khal
Moro,
with
his
son
Rhogoro.
The
man
with
the
green
beard
is
brother
to
the
Archon
of
Tyrosh,
and
the
man
behind
him
is
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.”

The
last
name
caught
Daenerys.
“A
knight?”

“No
less.”
Illyrio
smiled
through
his
beard.
“Anointed
with
the
seven
oils
by
the
High
Septon
himself.”

“What
is
he
doing
here?”
she
blurted.

“The
Usurper
wanted
his
head,”
Illyrio
told
them.
“Some
trifling
affront.
He
sold
some
poachers
to
a
Tyroshi
slaver
instead
of
giving
them
to
the
Night’s
Watch.
Absurd
law.
A
man
should
be
able
to
do
as
he
likes
with
his
own
chattel.”

“I
shall
wish
to
speak
with
Ser
Jorah
before
the
night
is
done,”
her
brother
said.
Dany
found
herself
looking
at
the
knight
curiously.
He
was
an
older
man,
past
forty
and
balding,
but
still
strong
and
fit.
Instead
of
silks
and
cottons,
he
wore
wool
and
leather.
His
tunic
was
a
dark
green,
embroidered
with
the
likeness
of
a
black
bear
standing
on
two
legs.

She
was
still
looking
at
this
strange
man
from
the
homeland
she
had
never
known
when
Magister
Illyrio
placed
a
moist
hand
on
her
bare
shoulder.
“Over
there,
sweet
princess,”
he
whispered,
“there
is
the
khal
himself.”

Dany
wanted
to
run
and
hide,
but
her
brother
was
looking
at
her,
and
if
she
displeased
him
she
knew
she
would
wake
the
dragon.
Anxiously,
she
turned
and
looked
at
the
man
Viserys
hoped
would
ask
to
wed
her
before
the
night
was
done.

The
slave
girl
had
not
been
far
wrong,
she
thought.
Khal
Drogo
was
a
head
taller
than
the
tallest
man
in
the
room,
yet
somehow
light
on
his
feet,
as
graceful
as
the
panther
in
Illyrio’s
menagerie.
He
was
younger
than
she’d
thought,
no
more
than
thirty.
His
skin
was
the
color
of
polished
copper,
his
thick
mustachios
bound
with
gold
and
bronze
rings.

“I
must
go
and
make
my
submissions,”
Magister
Illyrio
said.
“Wait
here.
I
shall
bring
him
to
you.”

Her
brother
took
her
by
the
arm
as
Illyrio
waddled
over
to
the
khal,
his
fingers
squeezing
so
hard
that
they
hurt.
“Do
you
see
his
braid,
sweet
sister?”

Drogo’s
braid
was
black
as
midnight
and
heavy
with
scented
oil,
hung
with
tiny
bells
that
rang
softly
as
he
moved.
It
swung
well
past
his
belt,
below
even
his
buttocks,
the
end
of
it
brushing
against
the
back
of
his
thighs.

“You
see
how
long
it
is?”
Viserys
said.
“When
Dothraki
are
defeated
in
combat,
they
cut
off
their
braids
in
disgrace,
so
the
world
will
know
their
shame.
Khal
Drogo
has
never
lost
a
fight.
He
is
Aegon
the
Dragonlord
come
again,
and
you
will
be
his
queen.”

Dany
looked
at
Khal
Drogo.
His
face
was
hard
and
cruel,
his
eyes
as
cold
and
dark
as
onyx.
Her
brother
hurt
her
sometimes,
when
she
woke
the
dragon,
but
he
did
not
frighten
her
the
way
this
man
frightened
her.
“I
don’t
want
to
be
his
queen,”
she
heard
herself
say
in
a
small,
thin
voice.
“Please,
please,
Viserys,
I
don’t
want
to,
I
want
to
go
home.”

“Home?”
He
kept
his
voice
low,
but
she
could
hear
the
fury
in
his
tone.
“How
are
we
to
go
home,
sweet
sister?
They
took
our
home
from
us!”
He
drew
her
into
the
shadows,
out
of
sight,
his
fingers
digging
into
her
skin.
“How
are
we
to
go
home?”
he
repeated,
meaning
King’s
Landing,
and
Dragonstone,
and
all
the
realm
they
had
lost.

Dany
had
only
meant
their
rooms
in
Illyrio’s
estate,
no
true
home
surely,
though
all
they
had,
but
her
brother
did
not
want
to
hear
that.
There
was
no
home
there
for
him.
Even
the
big
house
with
the
red
door
had
not
been
home
for
him.
His
fingers
dug
hard
into
her
arm,
demanding
an
answer.
“I
don’t
know…”she
said
at
last,
her
voice
breaking.
Tears
welled
in
her
eyes.

“I
do,”
he
said
sharply.
“We
go
home
with
an
army,
sweet
sister.
With
Khal
Drogo’s
army,
that
is
how
we
go
home.
And
if
you
must
wed
him
and
bed
him
for
that,
you
will.”
He
smiled
at
her.
“I’d
let
his
whole
khalasar
fuck
you
if
need
be,
sweet
sister,
all
forty
thousand
men,
and
their
horses
too
if
that
was
what
it
took
to
get
my
army.
Be
grateful
it
is
only
Drogo.
In
time
you
may
even
learn
to
like
him.
Now
dry
your
eyes.
Illyrio
is
bringing
him
over,
and
he
will
not
see
you
crying.”

Dany
turned
and
saw
that
it
was
true.
Magister
Illyrio,
all
smiles
and
bows,
was
escorting
Khal
Drogo
over
to
where
they
stood.
She
brushed
away
unfallen
tears
with
the
back
of
her
hand.

“Smile,”
Viserys
whispered
nervously,
his
hand
failing
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
“And
stand
up
straight.
Let
him
see
that
you
have
breasts.
Gods
know,
you
have
little
enough
as
is.”

Daenerys
smiled,
and
stood
up
straight.





EDDARD

The
visitors
poured
through
the
castle
gates
in
a
river
of
gold
and
silver
and
polished
steel,
three
hundred
strong,
a
pride
of
bannermen
and
knights,
of
sworn
swords
and
freeriders.
Over
their
heads
a
dozen
golden
banners
whipped
back
and
forth
in
the
northern
wind,
emblazoned
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon.

Ned
knew
many
of
the
riders.
There
came
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
with
hair
as
bright
as
beaten
gold,
and
there
Sandor
Clegane
with
his
terrible
burned
face.
The
tall
boy
beside
him
could
only
be
the
crown
prince,
and
that
stunted
little
man
behind
them
was
surely
the
Imp,
Tyrion
Lannister.

Yet
the
huge
man
at
the
head
of
the
column,
flanked
by
two
knights
in
the
snow-white
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard,
seemed
almost
a
stranger
to
Ned…
until
he
vaulted
off
the
back
of
his
warhorse
with
a
familiar
roar,
and
crushed
him
in
a
bone-crunching
hug.
“Ned!
Ah,
but
it
is
good
to
see
that
frozen
face
of
yours.”
The
king
looked
him
over
top
to
bottom,
and
laughed.
“You
have
not
changed
at
all.”

Would
that
Ned
had
been
able
to
say
the
same.
Fifteen
years
past,
when
they
had
ridden
forth
to
win
a
throne,
the
Lord
of
Storm’s
End
had
been
clean-shaven,
clear-eyed,
and
muscled
like
a
maiden’s
fantasy.
Six
and
a
half
feet
tall,
he
towered
over
lesser
men,
and
when
he
donned
his
armor
and
the
great
antlered
helmet
of
his
House,
he
became
a
veritable
giant.
He’d
had
a
giant’s
strength
too,
his
weapon
of
choice
a
spiked
iron
warhammer
that
Ned
could
scarcely
lift.
In
those
days,
the
smell
of
leather
and
blood
had
clung
to
him
like
perfume.

Now
it
was
perfume
that
clung
to
him
like
perfume,
and
he
had
a
girth
to
match
his
height.
Ned
had
last
seen
the
king
nine
years
before
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion,
when
the
stag
and
the
direwolf
had
joined
to
end
the
pretensions
of
the
self-proclaimed
King
of
the
Iron
Islands.
Since
the
night
they
had
stood
side
by
side
in
Greyjoy’s
fallen
stronghold,
where
Robert
had
accepted
the
rebel
lord’s
surrender
and
Ned
had
taken
his
son
Theon
as
hostage
and
ward,
the
king
had
gained
at
least
eight
stone.
A
beard
as
coarse
and
black
as
iron
wire
covered
his
jaw
to
hide
his
double
chin
and
the
sag
of
the
royal
jowls,
but
nothing
could
hide
his
stomach
or
the
dark
circles
under
his
eyes.

Yet
Robert
was
Ned’s
king
now,
and
not
just
a
friend,
so
he
said
only,
“Your
Grace.
Winterfell
is
yours.”

By
then
the
others
were
dismounting
as
well,
and
grooms
were
coming
forward
for
their
mounts.
Robert’s
queen,
Cersei
Lannister,
entered
on
foot
with
her
younger
children.
The
wheelhouse
in
which
they
had
ridden,
a
huge
double-decked
carriage
of
oiled
oak
and
gilded
metal
pulled
by
forty
heavy
draft
horses,
was
too
wide
to
pass
through
the
castle
gate.
Ned
knelt
in
the
snow
to
kiss
the
queen’s
ring,
while
Robert
embraced
Catelyn
like
a
long-lost
sister.
Then
the
children
had
been
brought
forward,
introduced,
and
approved
of
by
both
sides.

No
sooner
had
those
formalities
of
greeting
been
completed
than
the
king
had
said
to
his
host,
“Take
me
down
to
your
crypt,
Eddard.
I
would
pay
my
respects.”

Ned
loved
him
for
that,
for
remembering
her
still
after
all
these
years.
He
called
for
a
lantern.
No
other
words
were
needed.
The
queen
had
begun
to
protest.
They
had
been
riding
since
dawn,
everyone
was
tired
and
cold,
surely
they
should
refresh
themselves
first.
The
dead
would
wait.
She
had
said
no
more
than
that;
Robert
had
looked
at
her,
and
her
twin
brother
Jaime
had
taken
her
quietly
by
the
arm,
and
she
had
said
no
more.

They
went
down
to
the
crypt
together,
Ned
and
this
king
he
scarcely
recognized.
The
winding
stone
steps
were
narrow.
Ned
went
first
with
the
lantern.
“I
was
starting
to
think
we
would
never
reach
Winterfell,”
Robert
complained
as
they
descended.
“In
the
south,
the
way
they
talk
about
my
Seven
Kingdoms,
a
man
forgets
that
your
part
is
as
big
as
the
other
six
combined.”

“I
trust
you
enjoyed
the
journey,
Your
Grace?”

Robert
snorted.
“Bogs
and
forests
and
fields,
and
scarcely
a
decent
inn
north
of
the
Neck.
I’ve
never
seen
such
a
vast
emptiness.
Where
are
all
your
people?”

“Likely
they
were
too
shy
to
come
out,”
Ned
jested.
He
could
feel
the
chill
coming
up
the
stairs,
a
cold
breath
from
deep
within
the
earth.
“Kings
are
a
rare
sight
in
the
north.”

Robert
snorted.
“More
likely
they
were
hiding
under
the
snow.
Snow,
Ned!”
The
king
put
one
hand
on
the
wall
to
steady
himself
as
they
descended.

“Late
summer
snows
are
common
enough,”
Ned
said.
“I
hope
they
did
not
trouble
you.
They
are
usually
mild.”

“The
Others
take
your
mild
snows,”
Robert
swore.
“What
will
this
place
be
like
in
winter?
I
shudder
to
think.”

“The
winters
are
hard,”
Ned
admitted.
“But
the
Starks
will
endure.
We
always
have.”

“You
need
to
come
south,”
Robert
told
him.
“You
need
a
taste
of
summer
before
it
flees.
In
Highgarden
there
are
fields
of
golden
roses
that
stretch
away
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see.
The
fruits
are
so
ripe
they
explode
in
your
mouth—melons,
peaches,
fireplums,
you’ve
never
tasted
such
sweetness.
You’ll
see,
I
brought
you
some.
Even
at
Storm’s
End,
with
that
good
wind
off
the
bay,
the
days
are
so
hot
you
can
barely
move.
And
you
ought
to
see
the
towns,
Ned!
Flowers
everywhere,
the
markets
bursting
with
food,
the
summerwines
so
cheap
and
so
good
that
you
can
get
drunk
just
breathing
the
air.
Everyone
is
fat
and
drunk
and
rich.”
He
laughed
and
slapped
his
own
ample
stomach
a
thump.
“And
the
girls,
Ned!”
he
exclaimed,
his
eyes
sparkling.
“I
swear,
women
lose
all
modesty
in
the
heat.
They
swim
naked
in
the
river,
right
beneath
the
castle.
Even
in
the
streets,
it’s
too
damn
hot
for
wool
or
fur,
so
they
go
around
in
these
short
gowns,
silk
if
they
have
the
silver
and
cotton
if
not,
but
it’s
all
the
same
when
they
start
sweating
and
the
cloth
sticks
to
their
skin,
they
might
as
well
be
naked.”
The
king
laughed
happily.

Robert
Baratheon
had
always
been
a
man
of
huge
appetites,
a
man
who
knew
how
to
take
his
pleasures.
That
was
not
a
charge
anyone
could
lay
at
the
door
of
Eddard
Stark.
Yet
Ned
could
not
help
but
notice
that
those
pleasures
were
taking
a
toll
on
the
king.
Robert
was
breathing
heavily
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs,
his
face
red
in
the
lantern
light
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
crypt.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
said
respectfully.
He
swept
the
lantern
in
a
wide
semicircle.
Shadows
moved
and
lurched.
Flickering
light
touched
the
stones
underfoot
and
brushed
against
a
long
procession
of
granite
pillars
that
marched
ahead,
two
by
two,
into
the
dark.
Between
the
pillars,
the
dead
sat
on
their
stone
thrones
against
the
walls,
backs
against
the
sepulchres
that
contained
their
mortal
remains.
“She
is
down
at
the
end,
with
Father
and
Brandon.”

He
led
the
way
between
the
pillars
and
Robert
followed
wordlessly,
shivering
in
the
subterranean
chill.
It
was
always
cold
down
here.
Their
footsteps
rang
off
the
stones
and
echoed
in
the
vault
overhead
as
they
walked
among
the
dead
of
House
Stark.
The
Lords
of
Winterfell
watched
them
pass.
Their
likenesses
were
carved
into
the
stones
that
sealed
the
tombs.
In
long
rows
they
sat,
blind
eyes
staring
out
into
eternal
darkness,
while
great
stone
direwolves
curled
round
their
feet.
The
shifting
shadows
made
the
stone
figures
seem
to
stir
as
the
living
passed
by.

By
ancient
custom
an
iron
longsword
had
been
laid
across
the
lap
of
each
who
had
been
Lord
of
Winterfell,
to
keep
the
vengeful
spirits
in
their
crypts.
The
oldest
had
long
ago
rusted
away
to
nothing,
leaving
only
a
few
red
stains
where
the
metal
had
rested
on
stone.
Ned
wondered
if
that
meant
those
ghosts
were
free
to
roam
the
castle
now.
He
hoped
not.
The
first
Lords
of
Winterfell
had
been
men
hard
as
the
land
they
ruled.
In
the
centuries
before
the
Dragonlords
came
over
the
sea,
they
had
sworn
allegiance
to
no
man,
styling
themselves
the
Kings
in
the
North.

Ned
stopped
at
last
and
lifted
the
oil
lantern.
The
crypt
continued
on
into
darkness
ahead
of
them,
but
beyond
this
point
the
tombs
were
empty
and
unsealed;
black
holes
waiting
for
their
dead,
waiting
for
him
and
his
children.
Ned
did
not
like
to
think
on
that.
“Here,”
he
told
his
king.

Robert
nodded
silently,
knelt,
and
bowed
his
head.

There
were
three
tombs,
side
by
side.
Lord
Rickard
Stark,
Ned’s
father,
had
a
long,
stern
face.
The
stonemason
had
known
him
well.
He
sat
with
quiet
dignity,
stone
fingers
holding
tight
to
the
sword
across
his
lap,
but
in
life
all
swords
had
failed
him.
In
two
smaller
sepulchres
on
either
side
were
his
children.

Brandon
had
been
twenty
when
he
died,
strangled
by
order
of
the
Mad
King
Aerys
Targaryen
only
a
few
short
days
before
he
was
to
wed
Catelyn
Tully
of
Riverrun.
His
father
had
been
forced
to
watch
him
die.
He
was
the
true
heir,
the
eldest,
born
to
rule.

Lyanna
had
only
been
sixteen,
a
child-woman
of
surpassing
loveliness.
Ned
had
loved
her
with
all
his
heart.
Robert
had
loved
her
even
more.
She
was
to
have
been
his
bride.

“She
was
more
beautiful
than
that,”
the
king
said
after
a
silence.
His
eyes
lingered
on
Lyanna’s
face,
as
if
he
could
will
her
back
to
life.
Finally
he
rose,
made
awkward
by
his
weight.
“Ah,
damn
it,
Ned,
did
you
have
to
bury
her
in
a
place
like
this?”
His
voice
was
hoarse
with
remembered
grief.
“She
deserved
more
than
darkness…”

“She
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,”
Ned
said
quietly.
“This
is
her
place.”

“She
should
be
on
a
hill
somewhere,
under
a
fruit
tree,
with
the
sun
and
clouds
above
her
and
the
rain
to
wash
her
clean.”

“I
was
with
her
when
she
died,”
Ned
reminded
the
king.
“She
wanted
to
come
home,
to
rest
beside
Brandon
and
Father.”
He
could
hear
her
still
at
times.
Promise
me,
she
had
cried,
in
a
room
that
smelled
of
blood
and
roses.
Promise
me,
Ned.
The
fever
had
taken
her
strength
and
her
voice
had
been
faint
as
a
whisper,
but
when
he
gave
her
his
word,
the
fear
had
gone
out
of
his
sister’s
eyes.
Ned
remembered
the
way
she
had
smiled
then,
how
tightly
her
fingers
had
clutched
his
as
she
gave
up
her
hold
on
life,
the
rose
petals
spilling
from
her
palm,
dead
and
black.
After
that
he
remembered
nothing.
They
had
found
him
still
holding
her
body,
silent
with
grief.
The
little
crannogman,
Howland
Reed,
had
taken
her
hand
from
his.
Ned
could
recall
none
of
it.
“I
bring
her
flowers
when
I
can,”
he
said.
“Lyanna
was…
fond
of
flowers.”

The
king
touched
her
cheek,
his
fingers
brushing
across
the
rough
stone
as
gently
as
if
it
were
living
flesh.
“I
vowed
to
kill
Rhaegar
for
what
he
did
to
her.”

“You
did,”
Ned
reminded
him.

“Only
once,”
Robert
said
bitterly.

They
had
come
together
at
the
ford
of
the
Trident
while
the
battle
crashed
around
them,
Robert
with
his
warhammer
and
his
great
antlered
helm,
the
Targaryen
prince
armored
all
in
black.
On
his
breastplate
was
the
three-headed
dragon
of
his
House,
wrought
all
in
rubies
that
flashed
like
fire
in
the
sunlight.
The
waters
of
the
Trident
ran
red
around
the
hooves
of
their
destriers
as
they
circled
and
clashed,
again
and
again,
until
at
last
a
crushing
blow
from
Robert’s
hammer
stove
in
the
dragon
and
the
chest
beneath
it.
When
Ned
had
finally
come
on
the
scene,
Rhaegar
lay
dead
in
the
stream,
while
men
of
both
armies
scrabbled
in
the
swirling
waters
for
rubies
knocked
free
of
his
armor.

“In
my
dreams,
I
kill
him
every
night,”
Robert
admitted.
“A
thousand
deaths
will
still
be
less
than
he
deserves.”

There
was
nothing
Ned
could
say
to
that.
After
a
quiet,
he
said,
“We
should
return,
Your
Grace.
Your
wife
will
be
waiting.”

“The
Others
take
my
wife,”
Robert
muttered
sourly,
but
he
started
back
the
way
they
had
come,
his
footsteps
falling
heavily.
“And
if
I
hear
‘Your
Grace’
once
more,
I’ll
have
your
head
on
a
spike.
We
are
more
to
each
other
than
that.”

“I
had
not
forgotten,”
Ned
replied
quietly.
When
the
king
did
not
answer,
he
said,
“Tell
me
about
Jon.”

Robert
shook
his
head.
“I
have
never
seen
a
man
sicken
so
quickly.
We
gave
a
tourney
on
my
son’s
name
day.
If
you
had
seen
Jon
then,
you
would
have
sworn
he
would
live
forever.
A
fortnight
later
he
was
dead.
The
sickness
was
like
a
fire
in
his
gut.
It
burned
right
through
him.”
He
paused
beside
a
pillar,
before
the
tomb
of
a
long-dead
Stark.
“I
loved
that
old
man.”

“We
both
did.”
Ned
paused
a
moment.
“Catelyn
fears
for
her
sister.
How
does
Lysa
bear
her
grief?”

Robert’s
mouth
gave
a
bitter
twist.
“Not
well,
in
truth,”
he
admitted.
“I
think
losing
Jon
has
driven
the
woman
mad,
Ned.
She
has
taken
the
boy
back
to
the
Eyrie.
Against
my
wishes.
I
had
hoped
to
foster
him
with
Tywin
Lannister
at
Casterly
Rock.
Jon
had
no
brothers,
no
other
sons.
Was
I
supposed
to
leave
him
to
be
raised
by
women?”

Ned
would
sooner
entrust
a
child
to
a
pit
viper
than
to
Lord
Tywin,
but
he
left
his
doubts
unspoken.
Some
old
wounds
never
truly
heal,
and
bleed
again
at
the
slightest
word.
“The
wife
has
lost
the
husband,”
he
said
carefully.
“Perhaps
the
mother
feared
to
lose
the
son.
The
boy
is
very
young.”

“Six,
and
sickly,
and
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
gods
have
mercy,”
the
king
swore.
“Lord
Tywin
had
never
taken
a
ward
before.
Lysa
ought
to
have
been
honored.
The
Lannisters
are
a
great
and
noble
House.
She
refused
to
even
hear
of
it.
Then
she
left
in
the
dead
of
night,
without
so
much
as
a
by-your-leave.
Cersei
was
furious.”
He
sighed
deeply.
“The
boy
is
my
namesake,
did
you
know
that?
Robert
Arryn.
I
am
sworn
to
protect
him.
How
can
I
do
that
if
his
mother
steals
him
away?”

“I
will
take
him
as
ward,
if
you
wish,”
Ned
said.
“Lysa
should
consent
to
that.
She
and
Catelyn
were
close
as
girls,
and
she
would
be
welcome
here
as
well.”

“A
generous
offer,
my
friend,”
the
king
said,
“but
too
late.
Lord
Tywin
has
already
given
his
consent.
Fostering
the
boy
elsewhere
would
be
a
grievous
affront
to
him.”

“I
have
more
concern
for
my
nephew’s
welfare
than
I
do
for
Lannister
pride,”
Ned
declared.

“That
is
because
you
do
not
sleep
with
a
Lannister.”
Robert
laughed,
the
sound
rattling
among
the
tombs
and
bouncing
from
the
vaulted
ceiling.
His
smile
was
a
flash
of
white
teeth
in
the
thicket
of
the
huge
black
beard.
“Ah,
Ned,”
he
said,
“you
are
still
too
serious.”
He
put
a
massive
arm
around
Ned’s
shoulders.
“I
had
planned
to
wait
a
few
days
to
speak
to
you,
but
I
see
now
there’s
no
need
for
it.
Come,
walk
with
me.”

They
started
back
down
between
the
pillars.
Blind
stone
eyes
seemed
to
follow
them
as
they
passed.
The
king
kept
his
arm
around
Ned’s
shoulder.
“You
must
have
wondered
why
I
finally
came
north
to
Winterfell,
after
so
long.”

Ned
had
his
suspicions,
but
he
did
not
give
them
voice.
“For
the
joy
of
my
company,
surely,”
he
said
lightly.
“And
there
is
the
Wall.
You
need
to
see
it,
Your
Grace,
to
walk
along
its
battlements
and
talk
to
those
who
man
it.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
shadow
of
what
it
once
was.
Benjen
says—”

“No
doubt
I
will
hear
what
your
brother
says
soon
enough,”
Robert
said.
“The
Wall
has
stood
for
what,
eight
thousand
years?
It
can
keep
a
few
days
more.
I
have
more
pressing
concerns.
These
are
difficult
times.
I
need
good
men
about
me.
Men
like
Jon
Arryn.
He
served
as
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
as
Warden
of
the
East,
as
the
Hand
of
the
King.
He
will
not
be
easy
to
replace.”

“His
son…”
Ned
began.

“His
son
will
succeed
to
the
Eyrie
and
all
its
incomes,”
Robert
said
brusquely.
“No
more.”

That
took
Ned
by
surprise.
He
stopped,
startled,
and
turned
to
look
at
his
king.
The
words
came
unbidden.
“The
Arryns
have
always
been
Wardens
of
the
East.
The
title
goes
with
the
domain.”

“Perhaps
when
he
comes
of
age,
the
honor
can
be
restored
to
him,”
Robert
said.
“I
have
this
year
to
think
of,
and
next.
A
six-year-old
boy
is
no
war
leader,
Ned.”

“In
peace,
the
title
is
only
an
honor.
Let
the
boy
keep
it.
For
his
father’s
sake
if
not
his
own.
Surely
you
owe
Jon
that
much
for
his
service.”

The
king
was
not
pleased.
He
took
his
arm
from
around
Ned’s
shoulders.
“Jon’s
service
was
the
duty
he
owed
his
liege
lord.
I
am
not
ungrateful,
Ned.
You
of
all
men
ought
to
know
that.
But
the
son
is
not
the
father.
A
mere
boy
cannot
hold
the
east.”
Then
his
tone
softened.
“Enough
of
this.
There
is
a
more
important
office
to
discuss,
and
I
would
not
argue
with
you.”
Robert
grasped
Ned
by
the
elbow.
“I
have
need
of
you,
Ned.”

“I
am
yours
to
command,
Your
Grace.
Always.”
They
were
words
he
had
to
say,
and
so
he
said
them,
apprehensive
about
what
might
come
next.

Robert
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
him.
“Those
years
we
spent
in
the
Eyrie…
gods,
those
were
good
years.
I
want
you
at
my
side
again,
Ned.
I
want
you
down
in
King’s
Landing,
not
up
here
at
the
end
of
the
world
where
you
are
no
damned
use
to
anybody.”
Robert
looked
off
into
the
darkness,
for
a
moment
as
melancholy
as
a
Stark.
“I
swear
to
you,
sitting
a
throne
is
a
thousand
times
harder
than
winning
one.
Laws
are
a
tedious
business
and
counting
coppers
is
worse.
And
the
people…
there
is
no
end
of
them.
I
sit
on
that
damnable
iron
chair
and
listen
to
them
complain
until
my
mind
is
numb
and
my
ass
is
raw.
They
all
want
something,
money
or
land
or
justice.
The
lies
they
tell…
and
my
lords
and
ladies
are
no
better.
I
am
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
fools.
It
can
drive
a
man
to
madness,
Ned.
Half
of
them
don’t
dare
tell
me
the
truth,
and
the
other
half
can’t
find
it.
There
are
nights
I
wish
we
had
lost
at
the
Trident.
Ah,
no,
not
truly,
but…

“I
understand,”
Ned
said
softly.

Robert
looked
at
him.
“I
think
you
do.
If
so,
you
are
the
only
one,
my
old
friend.”
He
smiled.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark,
I
would
name
you
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

Ned
dropped
to
one
knee.
The
offer
did
not
surprise
him;
what
other
reason
could
Robert
have
had
for
coming
so
far?
The
Hand
of
the
King
was
the
second-most
powerful
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
He
spoke
with
the
king’s
voice,
commanded
the
king’s
armies,
drafted
the
king’s
laws.
At
times
he
even
sat
upon
the
Iron
Throne
to
dispense
king’s
justice,
when
the
king
was
absent,
or
sick,
or
otherwise
indisposed.
Robert
was
offering
him
a
responsibility
as
large
as
the
realm
itself.

It
was
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
wanted.

“Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“I
am
not
worthy
of
the
honor.”

Robert
groaned
with
good-humored
impatience.
“If
I
wanted
to
honor
you,
I’d
let
you
retire.
I
am
planning
to
make
you
run
the
kingdom
and
fight
the
wars
while
I
eat
and
drink
and
wench
myself
into
an
early
grave.”
He
slapped
his
gut
and
grinned.
“You
know
the
saying,
about
the
king
and
his
Hand?”

Ned
knew
the
saying.
“What
the
king
dreams,”
he
said,
“the
Hand
builds.”

“I
bedded
a
fishmaid
once
who
told
me
the
lowborn
have
a
choicer
way
to
put
it.
The
king
eats,
they
say,
and
the
Hand
takes
the
shit.”
He
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
his
laughter.
The
echoes
rang
through
the
darkness,
and
all
around
them
the
dead
of
Winterfell
seemed
to
watch
with
cold
and
disapproving
eyes.

Finally
the
laughter
dwindled
and
stopped.
Ned
was
still
on
one
knee,
his
eyes
upraised.
“Damn
it,
Ned,”
the
king
complained.
“You
might
at
least
humor
me
with
a
smile.”

“They
say
it
grows
so
cold
up
here
in
winter
that
a
man’s
laughter
freezes
in
his
throat
and
chokes
him
to
death,”
Ned
said
evenly.
“Perhaps
that
is
why
the
Starks
have
so
little
humor.”

“Come
south
with
me,
and
I’ll
teach
you
how
to
laugh
again,”
the
king
promised.
“You
helped
me
win
this
damnable
throne,
now
help
me
hold
it.
We
were
meant
to
rule
together.
If
Lyanna
had
lived,
we
should
have
been
brothers,
bound
by
blood
as
well
as
affection.
Well,
it
is
not
too
late.
I
have
a
son.
You
have
a
daughter.
My
Joff
and
your
Sansa
shall
join
our
houses,
as
Lyanna
and
I
might
once
have
done.”

This
offer
did
surprise
him.
“Sansa
is
only
eleven.”

Robert
waved
an
impatient
hand.
“Old
enough
for
betrothal.
The
marriage
can
wait
a
few
years.”
The
king
smiled.
“Now
stand
up
and
say
yes,
curse
you.”

“Nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
answered.
He
hesitated.
“These
honors
are
all
so
unexpected.
May
I
have
some
time
to
consider?
I
need
to
tell
my
wife…”

“Yes,
yes,
of
course,
tell
Catelyn,
sleep
on
it
if
you
must.”
The
king
reached
down,
clasped
Ned
by
the
hand,
and
pulled
him
roughly
to
his
feet.
“Just
don’t
keep
me
waiting
too
long.
I
am
not
the
most
patient
of
men.”

For
a
moment
Eddard
Stark
was
filled
with
a
terrible
sense
of
foreboding.
This
was
his
place,
here
in
the
north.
He
looked
at
the
stone
figures
all
around
them,
breathed
deep
in
the
chill
silence
of
the
crypt.
He
could
feel
the
eyes
of
the
dead.
They
were
all
listening,
he
knew.
And
winter
was
coming.





JON

There
were
times—not
many,
but
a
few—when
Jon
Snow
was
glad
he
was
a
bastard.
As
he
filled
his
wine
cup
once
more
from
a
passing
flagon,
it
struck
him
that
this
might
be
one
of
them.

He
settled
back
in
his
place
on
the
bench
among
the
younger
squires
and
drank.
The
sweet,
fruity
taste
of
summerwine
filled
his
mouth
and
brought
a
smile
to
his
lips.

The
Great
Hall
of
Winterfell
was
hazy
with
smoke
and
heavy
with
the
smell
of
roasted
meat
and
fresh-baked
bread.
Its
grey
stone
walls
were
draped
with
banners.
White,
gold,
crimson:
the
direwolf
of
Stark,
Baratheon’s
crowned
stag,
the
lion
of
Lannister.
A
singer
was
playing
the
high
harp
and
reciting
a
ballad,
but
down
at
this
end
of
the
hall
his
voice
could
scarcely
be
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
fire,
the
clangor
of
pewter
plates
and
cups,
and
the
low
mutter
of
a
hundred
drunken
conversations.

It
was
the
fourth
hour
of
the
welcoming
feast
laid
for
the
king.
Jon’s
brothers
and
sisters
had
been
seated
with
the
royal
children,
beneath
the
raised
platform
where
Lord
and
Lady
Stark
hosted
the
king
and
queen.
In
honor
of
the
occasion,
his
lord
father
would
doubtless
permit
each
child
a
glass
of
wine,
but
no
more
than
that.
Down
here
on
the
benches,
there
was
no
one
to
stop
Jon
drinking
as
much
as
he
had
a
thirst
for.

And
he
was
finding
that
he
had
a
man’s
thirst,
to
the
raucous
delight
of
the
youths
around
him,
who
urged
him
on
every
time
he
drained
a
glass.
They
were
fine
company,
and
Jon
relished
the
stories
they
were
telling,
tales
of
battle
and
bedding
and
the
hunt.
He
was
certain
that
his
companions
were
more
entertaining
than
the
king’s
offspring.
He
had
sated
his
curiosity
about
the
visitors
when
they
made
their
entrance.
The
procession
had
passed
not
a
foot
from
the
place
he
had
been
given
on
the
bench,
and
Jon
had
gotten
a
good
long
look
at
them
all.

His
lord
father
had
come
first,
escorting
the
queen.
She
was
as
beautiful
as
men
said.
A
jeweled
tiara
gleamed
amidst
her
long
golden
hair,
its
emeralds
a
perfect
match
for
the
green
of
her
eyes.
His
father
helped
her
up
the
steps
to
the
dais
and
led
her
to
her
seat,
but
the
queen
never
so
much
as
looked
at
him.
Even
at
fourteen,
Jon
could
see
through
her
smile.

Next
had
come
King
Robert
himself,
with
Lady
Stark
on
his
arm.
The
king
was
a
great
disappointment
to
Jon.
His
father
had
talked
of
him
often:
the
peerless
Robert
Baratheon,
demon
of
the
Trident,
the
fiercest
warrior
of
the
realm,
a
giant
among
princes.
Jon
saw
only
a
fat
man,
red-faced
under
his
beard,
sweating
through
his
silks.
He
walked
like
a
man
half
in
his
cups.

After
them
came
the
children.
Little
Rickon
first,
managing
the
long
walk
with
all
the
dignity
a
three-year-old
could
muster.
Jon
had
to
urge
him
on
when
he
stopped
to
visit.
Close
behind
came
Robb,
in
grey
wool
trimmed
with
white,
the
Stark
colors.
He
had
the
Princess
Myrcella
on
his
arm.
She
was
a
wisp
of
a
girl,
not
quite
eight,
her
hair
a
cascade
of
golden
curls
under
a
jeweled
net.
Jon
noticed
the
shy
looks
she
gave
Robb
as
they
passed
between
the
tables
and
the
timid
way
she
smiled
at
him.
He
decided
she
was
insipid.
Robb
didn’t
even
have
the
sense
to
realize
how
stupid
she
was;
he
was
grinning
like
a
fool.

His
half
sisters
escorted
the
royal
princes.
Arya
was
paired
with
plump
young
Tommen,
whose
white-blond
hair
was
longer
than
hers.
Sansa,
two
years
older,
drew
the
crown
prince,
Joffrey
Baratheon.
He
was
twelve,
younger
than
Jon
or
Robb,
but
taller
than
either,
to
Jon’s
vast
dismay.
Prince
Joffrey
had
his
sister’s
hair
and
his
mother’s
deep
green
eyes.
A
thick
tangle
of
blond
curls
dripped
down
past
his
golden
choker
and
high
velvet
collar.
Sansa
looked
radiant
as
she
walked
beside
him,
but
Jon
did
not
like
Joffrey’s
pouty
lips
or
the
bored,
disdainful
way
he
looked
at
Winterfell’s
Great
Hall.

He
was
more
interested
in
the
pair
that
came
behind
him:
the
queen’s
brothers,
the
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock.
The
Lion
and
the
Imp;
there
was
no
mistaking
which
was
which.
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
was
twin
to
Queen
Cersei;
tall
and
golden,
with
flashing
green
eyes
and
a
smile
that
cut
like
a
knife.
He
wore
crimson
silk,
high
black
boots,
a
black
satin
cloak.
On
the
breast
of
his
tunic,
the
lion
of
his
House
was
embroidered
in
gold
thread,
roaring
its
defiance.
They
called
him
the
Lion
of
Lannister
to
his
face
and
whispered
“Kingslayer”
behind
his
back.

Jon
found
it
hard
to
look
away
from
him.
This
is
what
a
king
should
look
like,
he
thought
to
himself
as
the
man
passed.

Then
he
saw
the
other
one,
waddling
along
half-hidden
by
his
brother’s
side.
Tyrion
Lannister,
the
youngest
of
Lord
Tywin’s
brood
and
by
far
the
ugliest.
All
that
the
gods
had
given
to
Cersei
and
Jaime,
they
had
denied
Tyrion.
He
was
a
dwarf,
half
his
brother’s
height,
struggling
to
keep
pace
on
stunted
legs.
His
head
was
too
large
for
his
body,
with
a
brute’s
squashed-in
face
beneath
a
swollen
shelf
of
brow.
One
green
eye
and
one
black
one
peered
out
from
under
a
lank
fall
of
hair
so
blond
it
seemed
white.
Jon
watched
him
with
fascination.

The
last
of
the
high
lords
to
enter
were
his
uncle,
Benjen
Stark
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
his
father’s
ward,
young
Theon
Greyjoy.
Benjen
gave
Jon
a
warm
smile
as
he
went
by.
Theon
ignored
him
utterly,
but
there
was
nothing
new
in
that.
After
all
had
been
seated,
toasts
were
made,
thanks
were
given
and
returned,
and
then
the
feasting
began.

Jon
had
started
drinking
then,
and
he
had
not
stopped.

Something
rubbed
against
his
leg
beneath
the
table.
Jon
saw
red
eyes
staring
up
at
him.
“Hungry
again?”
he
asked.
There
was
still
half
a
honeyed
chicken
in
the
center
of
the
table.
Jon
reached
out
to
tear
off
a
leg,
then
had
a
better
idea.
He
knifed
the
bird
whole
and
let
the
carcass
slide
to
the
floor
between
his
legs.
Ghost
ripped
into
it
in
savage
silence.
His
brothers
and
sisters
had
not
been
permitted
to
bring
their
wolves
to
the
banquet,
but
there
were
more
curs
than
Jon
could
count
at
this
end
of
the
hall,
and
no
one
had
said
a
word
about
his
pup.
He
told
himself
he
was
fortunate
in
that
too.

His
eyes
stung.
Jon
rubbed
at
them
savagely,
cursing
the
smoke.
He
swallowed
another
gulp
of
wine
and
watched
his
direwolf
devour
the
chicken.

Dogs
moved
between
the
tables,
trailing
after
the
serving
girls.
One
of
them,
a
black
mongrel
bitch
with
long
yellow
eyes,
caught
a
scent
of
the
chicken.
She
stopped
and
edged
under
the
bench
to
get
a
share.
Jon
watched
the
confrontation.
The
bitch
growled
low
in
her
throat
and
moved
closer.
Ghost
looked
up,
silent,
and
fixed
the
dog
with
those
hot
red
eyes.
The
bitch
snapped
an
angry
challenge.
She
was
three
times
the
size
of
the
direwolf
pup.
Ghost
did
not
move.
He
stood
over
his
prize
and
opened
his
mouth,
baring
his
fangs.
The
bitch
tensed,
barked
again,
then
thought
better
of
this
fight.
She
turned
and
slunk
away,
with
one
last
defiant
snap
to
save
her
pride.
Ghost
went
back
to
his
meal.

Jon
grinned
and
reached
under
the
table
to
ruffle
the
shaggy
white
fur.
The
direwolf
looked
up
at
him,
nipped
gently
at
his
hand,
then
went
back
to
eating.

“Is
this
one
of
the
direwolves
I’ve
heard
so
much
of?”
a
familiar
voice
asked
close
at
hand.

Jon
looked
up
happily
as
his
uncle
Ben
put
a
hand
on
his
head
and
ruffled
his
hair
much
as
Jon
had
ruffled
the
wolf’s.
“Yes,”
he
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.”

One
of
the
squires
interrupted
the
bawdy
story
he’d
been
telling
to
make
room
at
the
table
for
their
lord’s
brother.
Benjen
Stark
straddled
the
bench
with
long
legs
and
took
the
wine
cup
out
of
Jon’s
hand.
“Summerwine,”
he
said
after
a
taste.
“Nothing
so
sweet.
How
many
cups
have
you
had,
Jon?”

Jon
smiled.

Ben
Stark
laughed.
“As
I
feared.
Ah,
well.
I
believe
I
was
younger
than
you
the
first
time
I
got
truly
and
sincerely
drunk.”
He
snagged
a
roasted
onion,
dripping
brown
with
gravy,
from
a
nearby
trencher
and
bit
into
it.
It
crunched.

His
uncle
was
sharp-featured
and
gaunt
as
a
mountain
crag,
but
there
was
always
a
hint
of
laughter
in
his
blue-grey
eyes.
He
dressed
in
black,
as
befitted
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Tonight
it
was
rich
black
velvet,
with
high
leather
boots
and
a
wide
belt
with
a
silver
buckle.
A
heavy
silver
chain
was
looped
round
his
neck.
Benjen
watched
Ghost
with
amusement
as
he
ate
his
onion.
“A
very
quiet
wolf,”
he
observed.

“He’s
not
like
the
others,”
Jon
said.
“He
never
makes
a
sound.
That’s
why
I
named
him
Ghost.
That,
and
because
he’s
white.
The
others
are
all
dark,
grey
or
black.”

“There
are
still
direwolves
beyond
the
Wall.
We
hear
them
on
our
rangings.”
Benjen
Stark
gave
Jon
a
long
look.
“Don’t
you
usually
eat
at
table
with
your
brothers?”

“Most
times,”
Jon
answered
in
a
flat
voice.
“But
tonight
Lady
Stark
thought
it
might
give
insult
to
the
royal
family
to
seat
a
bastard
among
them.”

“I
see.”
His
uncle
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
raised
table
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
“My
brother
does
not
seem
very
festive
tonight.”

Jon
had
noticed
that
too.
A
bastard
had
to
learn
to
notice
things,
to
read
the
truth
that
people
hid
behind
their
eyes.
His
father
was
observing
all
the
courtesies,
but
there
was
tightness
in
him
that
Jon
had
seldom
seen
before.
He
said
little,
looking
out
over
the
hall
with
hooded
eyes,
seeing
nothing.
Two
seats
away,
the
king
had
been
drinking
heavily
all
night.
His
broad
face
was
flushed
behind
his
great
black
beard.
He
made
many
a
toast,
laughed
loudly
at
every
jest,
and
attacked
each
dish
like
a
starving
man,
but
beside
him
the
queen
seemed
as
cold
as
an
ice
sculpture.
“The
queen
is
angry
too,”
Jon
told
his
uncle
in
a
low,
quiet
voice.
“Father
took
the
king
down
to
the
crypts
this
afternoon.
The
queen
didn’t
want
him
to
go.”

Benjen
gave
Jon
a
careful,
measuring
look.
“You
don’t
miss
much,
do
you,
Jon?
We
could
use
a
man
like
you
on
the
Wall.”

Jon
swelled
with
pride.
“Robb
is
a
stronger
lance
than
I
am,
but
I’m
the
better
sword,
and
Hullen
says
I
sit
a
horse
as
well
as
anyone
in
the
castle.”

“Notable
achievements.”

“Take
me
with
you
when
you
go
back
to
the
Wall,”
Jon
said
in
a
sudden
rush.
“Father
will
give
me
leave
to
go
if
you
ask
him,
I
know
he
will.”

Uncle
Benjen
studied
his
face
carefully.
“The
Wall
is
a
hard
place
for
a
boy,
Jon.”

“I
am
almost
a
man
grown,”
Jon
protested.
“I
will
turn
fifteen
on
my
next
name
day,
and
Maester
Luwin
says
bastards
grow
up
faster
than
other
children.”

“That’s
true
enough,”
Benjen
said
with
a
downward
twist
of
his
mouth.
He
took
Jon’s
cup
from
the
table,
filled
it
fresh
from
a
nearby
pitcher,
and
drank
down
a
long
swallow.

“Daeren
Targaryen
was
only
fourteen
when
he
conquered
Dorne,”
Jon
said.
The
Young
Dragon
was
one
of
his
heroes.

“A
conquest
that
lasted
a
summer,”
his
uncle
pointed
out.
“Your
Boy
King
lost
ten
thousand
men
taking
the
place,
and
another
fifty
trying
to
hold
it.
Someone
should
have
told
him
that
war
isn’t
a
game.”
He
took
another
sip
of
wine.
“Also,”
he
said,
wiping
his
mouth,
“Daeren
Targaryen
was
only
eighteen
when
he
died.
Or
have
you
forgotten
that
part?”

“I
forget
nothing,”
Jon
boasted.
The
wine
was
making
him
bold.
He
tried
to
sit
very
straight,
to
make
himself
seem
taller.
“I
want
to
serve
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
Uncle.”

He
had
thought
on
it
long
and
hard,
lying
abed
at
night
while
his
brothers
slept
around
him.
Robb
would
someday
inherit
Winterfell,
would
command
great
armies
as
the
Warden
of
the
North.
Bran
and
Rickon
would
be
Robb’s
bannermen
and
rule
holdfasts
in
his
name.
His
sisters
Arya
and
Sansa
would
marry
the
heirs
of
other
great
houses
and
go
south
as
mistress
of
castles
of
their
own.
But
what
place
could
a
bastard
hope
to
earn?

“You
don’t
know
what
you’re
asking,
Jon.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
sworn
brotherhood.
We
have
no
families.
None
of
us
will
ever
father
sons.
Our
wife
is
duty.
Our
mistress
is
honor.”

“A
bastard
can
have
honor
too,”
Jon
said.
“I
am
ready
to
swear
your
oath.”

“You
are
a
boy
of
fourteen,”
Benjen
said.
“Not
a
man,
not
yet.
Until
you
have
known
a
woman,
you
cannot
understand
what
you
would
be
giving
up.”

“I
don’t
care
about
that!”
Jon
said
hotly.

“You
might,
if
you
knew
what
it
meant,”
Benjen
said.
“If
you
knew
what
the
oath
would
cost
you,
you
might
be
less
eager
to
pay
the
price,
son.”

Jon
felt
anger
rise
inside
him.
“I’m
not
your
son!”

Benjen
Stark
stood
up.
“More’s
the
pity.”
He
put
a
hand
on
Jon’s
shoulder.
“Come
back
to
me
after
you’ve
fathered
a
few
bastards
of
your
own,
and
we’ll
see
how
you
feel.”

Jon
trembled.
“I
will
never
father
a
bastard,”
he
said
carefully.
“Never!”
He
spat
it
out
like
venom.

Suddenly
he
realized
that
the
table
had
fallen
silent,
and
they
were
all
looking
at
him.
He
felt
the
tears
begin
to
well
behind
his
eyes.
He
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.

“I
must
be
excused,”
he
said
with
the
last
of
his
dignity.
He
whirled
and
bolted
before
they
could
see
him
cry.
He
must
have
drunk
more
wine
than
he
had
realized.
His
feet
got
tangled
under
him
as
he
tried
to
leave,
and
he
lurched
sideways
into
a
serving
girl
and
sent
a
flagon
of
spiced
wine
crashing
to
the
floor.
Laughter
boomed
all
around
him,
and
Jon
felt
hot
tears
on
his
cheeks.
Someone
tried
to
steady
him.
He
wrenched
free
of
their
grip
and
ran,
half-blind,
for
the
door.
Ghost
followed
close
at
his
heels,
out
into
the
night.

The
yard
was
quiet
and
empty.
A
lone
sentry
stood
high
on
the
battlements
of
the
inner
wall,
his
cloak
pulled
tight
around
him
against
the
cold.
He
looked
bored
and
miserable
as
he
huddled
there
alone,
but
Jon
would
have
traded
places
with
him
in
an
instant.
Otherwise
the
castle
was
dark
and
deserted.
Jon
had
seen
an
abandoned
holdfast
once,
a
drear
place
where
nothing
moved
but
the
wind
and
the
stones
kept
silent
about
whatever
people
had
lived
there.
Winterfell
reminded
him
of
that
tonight.

The
sounds
of
music
and
song
spilled
through
the
open
windows
behind
him.
They
were
the
last
things
Jon
wanted
to
hear.
He
wiped
away
his
tears
on
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt,
furious
that
he
had
let
them
fall,
and
turned
to
go.

“Boy,”
a
voice
called
out
to
him.
Jon
turned.

Tyrion
Lannister
was
sitting
on
the
ledge
above
the
door
to
the
Great
Hall,
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
gargoyle.
The
dwarf
grinned
down
at
him.
“Is
that
animal
a
wolf?”

“A
direwolf,”
Jon
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.”
He
stared
up
at
the
little
man,
his
disappointment
suddenly
forgotten.
“What
are
you
doing
up
there?
Why
aren’t
you
at
the
feast?”

“Too
hot,
too
noisy,
and
I’d
drunk
too
much
wine,”
the
dwarf
told
him.
“I
learned
long
ago
that
it
is
considered
rude
to
vomit
on
your
brother.
Might
I
have
a
closer
look
at
your
wolf?”

Jon
hesitated,
then
nodded
slowly.
“Can
you
climb
down,
or
shall
I
bring
a
ladder?”

“Oh,
bleed
that,”
the
little
man
said.
He
pushed
himself
off
the
ledge
into
empty
air.
Jon
gasped,
then
watched
with
awe
as
Tyrion
Lannister
spun
around
in
a
tight
ball,
landed
lightly
on
his
hands,
then
vaulted
backward
onto
his
legs.

Ghost
backed
away
from
him
uncertainly.

The
dwarf
dusted
himself
off
and
laughed.
“I
believe
I’ve
frightened
your
wolf.
My
apologies.”

“He’s
not
scared,”
Jon
said.
He
knelt
and
called
out.
“Ghost,
come
here.
Come
on.
That’s
it.”

The
wolf
pup
padded
closer
and
nuzzled
at
Jon’s
face,
but
he
kept
a
wary
eye
on
Tyrion
Lannister,
and
when
the
dwarf
reached
out
to
pet
him,
he
drew
back
and
bared
his
fangs
in
a
silent
snarl.
“Shy,
isn’t
he?”
Lannister
observed.

“Sit,
Ghost,”
Jon
commanded.
“That’s
it.
Keep
still.”
He
looked
up
at
the
dwarf.
“You
can
touch
him
now.
He
won’t
move
until
I
tell
him
to.
I’ve
been
training
him.”

“I
see,”
Lannister
said.
He
ruffled
the
snow-white
fur
between
Ghost’s
ears
and
said,
“Nice
wolf.”

“If
I
wasn’t
here,
he’d
tear
out
your
throat,”
Jon
said.
It
wasn’t
actually
true
yet,
but
it
would
be.

“In
that
case,
you
had
best
stay
close,”
the
dwarf
said.
He
cocked
his
oversized
head
to
one
side
and
looked
Jon
over
with
his
mismatched
eyes.
“I
am
Tyrion
Lannister.”

“I
know,”
Jon
said.
He
rose.
Standing,
he
was
taller
than
the
dwarf.
It
made
him
feel
strange.

“You’re
Ned
Stark’s
bastard,
aren’t
you?”

Jon
felt
a
coldness
pass
right
through
him.
He
pressed
his
lips
together
and
said
nothing.

“Did
I
offend
you?”
Lannister
said.
“Sorry.
Dwarfs
don’t
have
to
be
tactful.
Generations
of
capering
fools
in
motley
have
won
me
the
right
to
dress
badly
and
say
any
damn
thing
that
comes
into
my
head.”
He
grinned.
“You
are
the
bastard,
though.”

“Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
my
father,”
Jon
admitted
stiffly.

Lannister
studied
his
face.
“Yes,”
he
said.
“I
can
see
it.
You
have
more
of
the
north
in
you
than
your
brothers.”

“Half
brothers,”
Jon
corrected.
He
was
pleased
by
the
dwarf’s
comment,
but
he
tried
not
to
let
it
show.

“Let
me
give
you
some
counsel,
bastard,”
Lannister
said.
“Never
forget
what
you
are,
for
surely
the
world
will
not.
Make
it
your
strength.
Then
it
can
never
be
your
weakness.
Armor
yourself
in
it,
and
it
will
never
be
used
to
hurt
you.”

Jon
was
in
no
mood
for
anyone’s
counsel.
“What
do
you
know
about
being
a
bastard?”

“All
dwarfs
are
bastards
in
their
father’s
eyes.”

“You
are
your
mother’s
trueborn
son
of
Lannister.”

“Am
I?”
the
dwarf
replied,
sardonic.
“Do
tell
my
lord
father.
My
mother
died
birthing
me,
and
he’s
never
been
sure.”

“I
don’t
even
know
who
my
mother
was,”
Jon
said.

“Some
woman,
no
doubt.
Most
of
them
are.”
He
favored
Jon
with
a
rueful
grin.
“Remember
this,
boy.
All
dwarfs
may
be
bastards,
yet
not
all
bastards
need
be
dwarfs.”
And
with
that
he
turned
and
sauntered
back
into
the
feast,
whistling
a
tune.
When
he
opened
the
door,
the
light
from
within
threw
his
shadow
clear
across
the
yard,
and
for
just
a
moment
Tyrion
Lannister
stood
tall
as
a
king.





CATELYN

Of
all
the
rooms
in
Winterfell’s
Great
Keep,
Catelyn’s
bedchambers
were
the
hottest.
She
seldom
had
to
light
a
fire.
The
castle
had
been
built
over
natural
hot
springs,
and
the
scalding
waters
rushed
through
its
walls
and
chambers
like
blood
through
a
man’s
body,
driving
the
chill
from
the
stone
halls,
filling
the
glass
gardens
with
a
moist
warmth,
keeping
the
earth
from
freezing.
Open
pools
smoked
day
and
night
in
a
dozen
small
courtyards.
That
was
a
little
thing,
in
summer;
in
winter,
it
was
the
difference
between
life
and
death.

Catelyn’s
bath
was
always
hot
and
steaming,
and
her
walls
warm
to
the
touch.
The
warmth
reminded
her
of
Riverrun,
of
days
in
the
sun
with
Lysa
and
Edmure,
but
Ned
could
never
abide
the
heat.
The
Starks
were
made
for
the
cold,
he
would
tell
her,
and
she
would
laugh
and
tell
him
in
that
case
they
had
certainly
built
their
castle
in
the
wrong
place.

So
when
they
had
finished,
Ned
rolled
off
and
climbed
from
her
bed,
as
he
had
a
thousand
times
before.
He
crossed
the
room,
pulled
back
the
heavy
tapestries,
and
threw
open
the
high
narrow
windows
one
by
one,
letting
the
night
air
into
the
chamber.

The
wind
swirled
around
him
as
he
stood
facing
the
dark,
naked
and
empty-handed.
Catelyn
pulled
the
furs
to
her
chin
and
watched
him.
He
looked
somehow
smaller
and
more
vulnerable,
like
the
youth
she
had
wed
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun,
fifteen
long
years
gone.
Her
loins
still
ached
from
the
urgency
of
his
lovemaking.
It
was
a
good
ache.
She
could
feel
his
seed
within
her.
She
prayed
that
it
might
quicken
there.
It
had
been
three
years
since
Rickon.
She
was
not
too
old.
She
could
give
him
another
son.

“I
will
refuse
him,”
Ned
said
as
he
turned
back
to
her.
His
eyes
were
haunted,
his
voice
thick
with
doubt.

Catelyn
sat
up
in
the
bed.
“You
cannot.
You
must
not.”

“My
duties
are
here
in
the
north.
I
have
no
wish
to
be
Robert’s
Hand.”

“He
will
not
understand
that.
He
is
a
king
now,
and
kings
are
not
like
other
men.
If
you
refuse
to
serve
him,
he
will
wonder
why,
and
sooner
or
later
he
will
begin
to
suspect
that
you
oppose
him.
Can’t
you
see
the
danger
that
would
put
us
in?”

Ned
shook
his
head,
refusing
to
believe.
“Robert
would
never
harm
me
or
any
of
mine.
We
were
closer
than
brothers.
He
loves
me.
If
I
refuse
him,
he
will
roar
and
curse
and
bluster,
and
in
a
week
we
will
laugh
about
it
together.
I
know
the
man!”

“You
knew
the
man,”
she
said.
“The
king
is
a
stranger
to
you.”
Catelyn
remembered
the
direwolf
dead
in
the
snow,
the
broken
antler
lodged
deep
in
her
throat.
She
had
to
make
him
see.
“Pride
is
everything
to
a
king,
my
lord.
Robert
came
all
this
way
to
see
you,
to
bring
you
these
great
honors,
you
cannot
throw
them
back
in
his
face.”

“Honors?”
Ned
laughed
bitterly.

“In
his
eyes,
yes,”
she
said.

“And
in
yours?”

“And
in
mine,”
she
blazed,
angry
now.
Why
couldn’t
he
see?
“He
offers
his
own
son
in
marriage
to
our
daughter,
what
else
would
you
call
that?
Sansa
might
someday
be
queen.
Her
sons
could
rule
from
the
Wall
to
the
mountains
of
Dorne.
What
is
so
wrong
with
that?”

“Gods,
Catelyn,
Sansa
is
only
eleven,”
Ned
said.
“And
Joffrey…
Joffrey
is…”

She
finished
for
him.
“…crown
prince,
and
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne.
And
I
was
only
twelve
when
my
father
promised
me
to
your
brother
Brandon.”

That
brought
a
bitter
twist
to
Ned’s
mouth.
“Brandon.
Yes.
Brandon
would
know
what
to
do.
He
always
did.
It
was
all
meant
for
Brandon.
You,
Winterfell,
everything.
He
was
born
to
be
a
King’s
Hand
and
a
father
to
queens.
I
never
asked
for
this
cup
to
pass
to
me.”

“Perhaps
not,”
Catelyn
said,
“but
Brandon
is
dead,
and
the
cup
has
passed,
and
you
must
drink
from
it,
like
it
or
not.”

Ned
turned
away
from
her,
back
to
the
night.
He
stood
staring
out
in
the
darkness,
watching
the
moon
and
the
stars
perhaps,
or
perhaps
the
sentries
on
the
wall.

Catelyn
softened
then,
to
see
his
pain.
Eddard
Stark
had
married
her
in
Brandon’s
place,
as
custom
decreed,
but
the
shadow
of
his
dead
brother
still
lay
between
them,
as
did
the
other,
the
shadow
of
the
woman
he
would
not
name,
the
woman
who
had
borne
him
his
bastard
son.

She
was
about
to
go
to
him
when
the
knock
came
at
the
door,
loud
and
unexpected.
Ned
turned,
frowning.
“What
is
it?”

Desmond’s
voice
came
through
the
door.
“My
lord,
Maester
Luwin
is
without
and
begs
urgent
audience.”

“You
told
him
I
had
left
orders
not
to
be
disturbed?”

“Yes,
my
lord.
He
insists.”

“Very
well.
Send
him
in.”

Ned
crossed
to
the
wardrobe
and
slipped
on
a
heavy
robe.
Catelyn
realized
suddenly
how
cold
it
had
become.
She
sat
up
in
bed
and
pulled
the
furs
to
her
chin.
“Perhaps
we
should
close
the
windows,”
she
suggested.

Ned
nodded
absently.
Maester
Luwin
was
shown
in.

The
maester
was
a
small
grey
man.
His
eyes
were
grey,
and
quick,
and
saw
much.
His
hair
was
grey,
what
little
the
years
had
left
him.
His
robe
was
grey
wool,
trimmed
with
white
fur,
the
Stark
colors.
Its
great
floppy
sleeves
had
pockets
hidden
inside.
Luwin
was
always
tucking
things
into
those
sleeves
and
producing
other
things
from
them:
books,
messages,
strange
artifacts,
toys
for
the
children.
With
all
he
kept
hidden
in
his
sleeves,
Catelyn
was
surprised
that
Maester
Luwin
could
lift
his
arms
at
all.

The
maester
waited
until
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
before
he
spoke.
“My
lord,”
he
said
to
Ned,
“pardon
for
disturbing
your
rest.
I
have
been
left
a
message.”

Ned
looked
irritated.
“Been
left?
By
whom?
Has
there
been
a
rider?
I
was
not
told.”

“There
was
no
rider,
my
lord.
Only
a
carved
wooden
box,
left
on
a
table
in
my
observatory
while
I
napped.
My
servants
saw
no
one,
but
it
must
have
been
brought
by
someone
in
the
king’s
party.
We
have
had
no
other
visitors
from
the
south.”

“A
wooden
box,
you
say?”
Catelyn
said.

“Inside
was
a
fine
new
lens
for
the
observatory,
from
Myr
by
the
look
of
it.
The
lenscrafters
of
Myr
are
without
equal.”

Ned
frowned.
He
had
little
patience
for
this
sort
of
thing,
Catelyn
knew.
“A
lens,”
he
said.
“What
has
that
to
do
with
me?”

“I
asked
the
same
question,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Clearly
there
was
more
to
this
than
the
seeming.”

Under
the
heavy
weight
of
her
furs,
Catelyn
shivered.
“A
lens
is
an
instrument
to
help
us
see.”

“Indeed
it
is.”
He
fingered
the
collar
of
his
order;
a
heavy
chain
worn
tight
around
the
neck
beneath
his
robe,
each
link
forged
from
a
different
metal.

Catelyn
could
feel
dread
stirring
inside
her
once
again.
“What
is
it
that
they
would
have
us
see
more
clearly?”

“The
very
thing
I
asked
myself.”
Maester
Luwin
drew
a
tightly
rolled
paper
out
of
his
sleeve.
“I
found
the
true
message
concealed
within
a
false
bottom
when
I
dismantled
the
box
the
lens
had
come
in,
but
it
is
not
for
my
eyes.”

Ned
held
out
his
hand.
“Let
me
have
it,
then.”

Luwin
did
not
stir.
“Pardons,
my
lord.
The
message
is
not
for
you
either.
It
is
marked
for
the
eyes
of
the
Lady
Catelyn,
and
her
alone.
May
I
approach?”

Catelyn
nodded,
not
trusting
to
speak.
The
maester
placed
the
paper
on
the
table
beside
the
bed.
It
was
sealed
with
a
small
blob
of
blue
wax.
Luwin
bowed
and
began
to
retreat.

“Stay,”
Ned
commanded
him.
His
voice
was
grave.
He
looked
at
Catelyn.
“What
is
it?
My
lady,
you’re
shaking.”

“I’m
afraid,”
she
admitted.
She
reached
out
and
took
the
letter
in
trembling
hands.
The
furs
dropped
away
from
her
nakedness,
forgotten.
In
the
blue
wax
was
the
moon-and-falcon
seal
of
House
Arryn.
“It’s
from
Lysa.”
Catelyn
looked
at
her
husband.
“It
will
not
make
us
glad,”
she
told
him.
“There
is
grief
in
this
message,
Ned.
I
can
feel
it.”

Ned
frowned,
his
face
darkening.
“Open
it.”

Catelyn
broke
the
seal.

Her
eyes
moved
over
the
words.
At
first
they
made
no
sense
to
her.
Then
she
remembered.
“Lysa
took
no
chances.
When
we
were
girls
together,
we
had
a
private
language,
she
and
I.”

“Can
you
read
it?”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
admitted.

“Then
tell
us.”

“Perhaps
I
should
withdraw,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

“No,”
Catelyn
said.
“We
will
need
your
counsel.”
She
threw
back
the
furs
and
climbed
from
the
bed.
The
night
air
was
as
cold
as
the
grave
on
her
bare
skin
as
she
padded
across
the
room.

Maester
Luwin
averted
his
eyes.
Even
Ned
looked
shocked.
“What
are
you
doing?”
he
asked.

“Lighting
a
fire,”
Catelyn
told
him.
She
found
a
dressing
gown
and
shrugged
into
it,
then
knelt
over
the
cold
hearth.

“Maester
Luwin—”
Ned
began.

“Maester
Luwin
has
delivered
all
my
children,”
Catelyn
said.
“This
is
no
time
for
false
modesty.”
She
slid
the
paper
in
among
the
kindling
and
placed
the
heavier
logs
on
top
of
it.

Ned
crossed
the
room,
took
her
by
the
arm,
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet.
He
held
her
there,
his
face
inches
from
her.
“My
lady,
tell
me!
What
was
this
message?”

Catelyn
stiffened
in
his
grasp.
“A
warning,”
she
said
softly.
“If
we
have
the
wits
to
hear.”

His
eyes
searched
her
face.
“Go
on.”

“Lysa
says
Jon
Arryn
was
murdered.”

His
fingers
tightened
on
her
arm.
“By
whom?”

“The
Lannisters,”
she
told
him.
“The
queen.”

Ned
released
his
hold
on
her
arm.
There
were
deep
red
marks
on
her
skin.
“Gods,”
he
whispered.
His
voice
was
hoarse.
“Your
>>>>>>> asd
sister
is
sick
with
grief.
She
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
forgets
herself.”

She
wanted
to
slap
him
again
for
that.
I
must
have
been
mad
to
think
he
could
be
Hand.
She
would
sooner
abolish
the
office.
When
had
a
Hand
ever
brought
her
anything
but
grief?
Jon
Arryn
put
Robert
Baratheon
in
her
bed,
and
before
he
died
he’d
begun
sniffing
about
her
and
Jaime
as
well.
Eddard
Stark
took
up
right
where
Arryn
had
left
off;
his
meddling
had
forced
her
to
rid
herself
of
Robert
sooner
than
she
would
have
liked,
before
she
could
deal
with
his
pestilential
brothers.
Tyrion
sold
Myrcella
to
the
Dornishmen,
made
one
of
her
sons
his
hostage,
and
murdered
the
other.
And
when
Lord
Tywin
returned
to
King’s
Landing...

The
next
Hand
will
know
his
place,
she
promised
herself.
It
would
have
to
be
Ser
Kevan.
Her
uncle
was
tireless,
prudent,
unfailingly
obedient.
She
could
rely
on
him,
as
her
father
had.
The
hand
does
not
argue
with
the
head.
She
had
a
realm
to
rule,
but
she
would
need
new
men
to
help
her
rule
it.
Pycelle
was
a
doddering
lickspittle,
Jaime
had
lost
his
courage
with
his
sword
hand,
and
Mace
Tyrell
and
his
cronies
Redwyne
and
Rowan
could
not
be
trusted.
For
all
she
knew
they
might
have
had
a
part
in
this.
Lord
Tyrell
had
to
know
that
he
would
never
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms
so
long
as
Tywin
Lannister
lived.

I
will
need
to
move
carefully
with
that
one.
The
city
was
full
of
his
men,
and
he’d
even
managed
to
plant
one
of
his
sons
in
the
Kingsguard,
and
meant
to
plant
his
daughter
in
Tommen’s
bed.
It
still
made
her
furious
to
think
that
Father
had
agreed
to
betroth
Tommen
to
Margaery
Tyrell.
The
girl
is
twice
his
age
and
twice
widowed.
Mace
Tyrell
claimed
his
daughter
was
still
virgin,
but
Cersei
had
her
doubts.
Joffrey
had
been
murdered
before
he
could
bed
the
girl,
but
she
had
been
wed
to
Renly
first...
A
man
may
prefer
the
taste
of
hippocras,
yet
if
you
set
a
tankard
of
ale
before
him,
he
will
quaff
it
quick
enough.
She
must
command
Lord
Varys
to
find
out
what
he
could.

That
stopped
her
where
she
stood.
She
had
forgotten
about
Varys.
He
should
be
here.
He
is
always
here.
Whenever
anything
of
import
happened
in
the
Red
Keep,
the
eunuch
appeared
as
if
from
nowhere.
Jaime
is
here,
and
Uncle
Kevan,
and
Pycelle
has
come
and
gone,
but
not
Varys.
A
cold
finger
touched
her
spine.
He
was
part
of
this.
He
must
have
feared
that
Father
meant
to
have
his
head,
so
he
struck
first.
Lord
Tywin
had
never
had
any
love
for
the
simpering
master
of
whisperers.
And
if
any
man
knew
the
Red
Keep’s
secrets,
it
was
surely
the
master
of
whisperers.
He
must
have
made
common
cause
with
Lord
Stannis.
They
served
together
on
Robert’s
council,
after
all...

Cersei
strode
to
the
door
of
the
bedchamber,
to
Ser
Meryn
Trant.
“Trant,
bring
me
Lord
Varys.
Squealing
and
squirming
if
need
be,
but
unharmed.”

“As
Your
Grace
commands.”

But
no
sooner
had
one
Kingsguard
departed
than
another
one
returned.
Ser
Boros
Blount
was
red-faced
and
puffing
from
his
headlong
rush
up
the
steps.
“Gone,”
he
panted,
when
he
saw
the
queen.
He
sank
to
one
knee.
“The
Imp...
his
cell’s
open,
Your
Grace...
no
sign
of
him
anywhere...”

The
dream
was
true.
“I
gave
orders,”
she
said.
“He
was
to
be
kept
under
guard,
night
and
day...”

Blount’s
chest
was
heaving.
“One
of
the
gaolers
has
gone
missing
too.
Rugen,
his
name
was.
Two
other
men
we
found
asleep.”

It
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
scream.
“I
hope
you
did
not
wake
them,
Ser
Boros.
Let
them
sleep.”

“Sleep?”
He
looked
up,
jowly
and
confused.
“Aye,
Your
Grace.
How
long
shall—”

“Forever.
See
that
they
sleep
forever,
ser.
I
will
not
suffer
guards
to
sleep
on
watch.”
He
is
in
the
walls.
He
killed
Father
as
he
killed
Mother,
as
he
killed
Joff.
The
dwarf
would
come
for
her
as
well,
the
queen
knew,
just
as
the
old
woman
had
promised
her
in
the
dimness
of
that
tent.
I
laughed
in
her
face,
but
she
had
powers.
I
saw
my
future
in
a
drop
of
blood.
My
doom.
Her
legs
were
weak
as
water.
Ser
Boros
tried
to
take
her
by
the
arm,
but
the
queen
recoiled
from
his
touch.
For
all
she
knew
he
might
be
one
of
Tyrion’s
creatures.
“Get
away
from
me,”
she
said.
“Get
away!”
She
staggered
to
a
settle.

“Your
Grace?”
said
Blount.
“Shall
I
fetch
a
cup
of
water?”

It
is
blood
I
need,
not
water.
Tyrion’s
blood,
the
blood
of
the
valonqar.
The
torches
spun
around
her.
Cersei
closed
her
eyes,
and
saw
the
dwarf
grinning
at
her.
No,
she
thought,
no,
I
was
almost
rid
of
you.
But
his
fingers
had
closed
around
her
neck,
and
she
could
feel
them
beginning
to
tighten.





BRIENNE

“I
am
looking
for
a
maid
of
three-and-ten,”
she
told
the
grey-haired
goodwife
beside
the
village
well.
“A
highborn
maid
and
very
beautiful,
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
She
may
have
been
traveling
with
a
portly
knight
of
forty
years,
or
perhaps
with
a
fool.
Have
you
seen
her?”

“Not
as
I
recall,
ser,”
the
goodwife
said,
knuckling
her
forehead.
“But
I’ll
keep
my
eye
out,
that
I
will.”

The
blacksmith
had
not
seen
her
either,
nor
the
septon
in
the
village
sept,
the
swineherd
with
his
pigs,
the
girl
pulling
up
onions
from
her
garden,
nor
any
of
the
other
simple
folk
that
the
Maid
of
Tarth
found
amongst
the
daub-and-wattle
huts
of
Rosby.
Still,
she
persisted.
This
is
the
shortest
road
to
Duskendale,
Brienne
told
herself.
If
Sansa
came
this
way,
someone
must
have
seen
her.
At
the
castle
gates
she
posed
her
question
to
two
spearmen
whose
badges
showed
three
red
chevronels
on
ermine,
the
arms
of
House
Rosby.
“If
she’s
on
the
roads
these
days
she
won’t
be
no
maid
for
long,”
said
the
older
man.
The
younger
wanted
to
know
if
the
girl
had
that
auburn
hair
between
her
legs
as
well.

I
will
find
no
help
here.
As
Brienne
mounted
up
again,
she
glimpsed
a
skinny
boy
atop
a
piebald
horse
at
the
far
end
of
the
village.
I
have
not
talked
with
that
one,
she
thought,
but
he
vanished
behind
the
sept
before
she
could
seek
him
out.
She
did
not
trouble
to
chase
after
him.
Most
like
he
knew
no
more
than
the
others
had.
Rosby
was
scarce
more
than
a
wide
place
in
the
road;
Sansa
would
have
had
no
reason
to
linger
here.
Returning
to
the
road,
Brienne
headed
north
and
east
past
apple
orchards
and
fields
of
barley,
and
soon
left
the
village
and
its
castle
well
behind.
It
was
at
Duskendale
that
she
would
find
her
quarry,
she
told
herself.
If
she
came
this
way
at
all.

“I
will
find
the
girl
and
keep
her
safe,”
Brienne
had
promised
Ser
Jaime,
back
at
King’s
Landing.
“For
her
lady
mother’s
sake.
And
for
yours.”
Noble
words,
but
words
were
easy.
Deeds
were
hard.
She
had
lingered
too
long
and
learned
too
little
in
the
city.
I
should
have
set
out
earlier...
but
to
where?
Sansa
Stark
had
vanished
on
the
night
King
Joffrey
died,
and
if
anyone
had
seen
her
since,
or
had
any
inkling
where
she
might
have
gone,
they
were
not
talking.
Not
to
me,
at
least.

Brienne
believed
the
girl
had
left
the
city.
If
she
were
still
in
King’s
Landing,
the
gold
cloaks
would
have
turned
her
up.
She
had
to
have
gone
elsewhere...
but
elsewhere
is
a
big
place.
If
I
were
a
maiden
newly
flowered,
alone
and
afraid,
in
desperate
danger,
what
would
I
do?
she
had
asked
herself.
Where
would
I
go?
For
her,
the
answer
came
easy.
She
would
make
her
way
back
to
Tarth,
to
her
father.
Sansa’s
father
had
been
beheaded
whilst
she
watched,
however.
Her
lady
mother
was
dead
too,
murdered
at
the
Twins,
and
Winterfell,
the
great
Stark
stronghold,
had
been
sacked
and
burned,
its
people
put
to
the
sword.
She
has
no
home
to
run
to,
no
father,
no
mother,
no
brothers.
She
might
be
in
the
next
town,
or
on
a
ship
to
Asshai;
one
seemed
as
likely
as
the
other.

Even
if
Sansa
Stark
had
wanted
to
go
home,
how
would
she
get
there?
The
kingsroad
was
not
safe;
even
a
child
would
know
that.
The
ironborn
held
Moat
Cailin
athwart
the
Neck,
and
at
the
Twins
sat
the
Freys,
who
had
murdered
Sansa’s
brother
and
lady
mother.
The
girl
could
go
by
sea
if
she
had
the
coin,
but
the
harbor
at
King’s
Landing
was
still
in
ruins,
the
river
a
jumble
of
broken
quays
and
burned
and
sunken
galleys.
Brienne
had
asked
along
the
docks,
but
no
one
could
remember
a
ship
leaving
on
the
night
King
Joffrey
died.
A
few
trading
ships
were
anchoring
in
the
bay
and
off-loading
by
boat,
one
man
told
her,
but
more
were
continuing
up
the
coast
to
Duskendale,
where
the
port
was
busier
than
ever.

Brienne’s
mare
was
sweet
to
look
upon
and
kept
a
pretty
pace.
There
were
more
travelers
than
she
would
have
thought.
Begging
brothers
trundled
by
with
their
bowls
dangling
on
thongs
about
their
necks.
A
young
septon
galloped
past
upon
a
palfrey
as
fine
as
any
lord’s,
and
later
she
met
a
band
of
silent
sisters
who
shook
their
heads
when
Brienne
put
her
question
to
them.
A
train
of
oxcarts
lumbered
south
with
grain
and
sacks
of
wool,
and
later
she
passed
a
swineherd
driving
pigs,
and
an
old
woman
in
a
horse
litter
with
an
escort
of
mounted
guards.
She
asked
all
of
them
if
they
had
seen
a
highborn
girl
of
three-and-ten
years
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
None
had.
She
asked
about
the
road
ahead
as
well.
“’Twixt
here
and
Duskendale
is
safe
enough,”
one
man
told
her,
“but
past
Duskendale
there’s
outlaws,
and
broken
men
in
the
woods.”

Only
the
soldier
pines
and
sentinels
still
showed
green;
the
broadleaf
trees
had
donned
mantles
of
russet
and
gold,
or
else
uncloaked
themselves
to
scratch
against
the
sky
with
branches
brown
and
bare.
Every
gust
of
wind
drove
swirling
clouds
of
dead
leaves
across
the
rutted
road.
They
made
a
rustling
sound
as
they
scuttled
past
the
hooves
of
the
big
bay
mare
that
Jaime
Lannister
had
bestowed
on
her.
As
easy
to
find
one
leaf
in
the
wind
as
one
girl
lost
in
Westeros.
She
found
herself
wondering
whether
Jaime
had
given
her
this
task
as
some
cruel
jape.
Perhaps
Sansa
Stark
was
dead,
beheaded
for
her
part
in
King
Joffrey’s
death,
buried
in
some
unmarked
grave.
How
better
to
conceal
her
murder
than
by
sending
some
big
stupid
wench
from
Tarth
to
find
her?

Jaime
would
not
do
that.
He
was
sincere.
He
gave
me
the
sword,
and
called
it
Oathkeeper.
Anyway,
it
made
no
matter.
She
had
promised
Lady
Catelyn
that
she
would
bring
back
her
daughters,
and
no
promise
was
as
solemn
as
one
sworn
to
the
dead.
The
younger
girl
was
long
dead,
Jaime
claimed;
the
Arya
the
Lannisters
sent
north
to
marry
Roose
Bolton’s
bastard
was
a
fraud.
That
left
only
Sansa.
Brienne
had
to
find
her.

Near
dusk
she
saw
a
campfire
burning
by
a
brook.
Two
men
sat
beside
it
grilling
trout,
their
arms
and
armor
stacked
beneath
a
tree.
One
was
old
and
one
was
somewhat
younger,
though
far
from
young.
The
younger
rose
to
greet
her.
He
had
a
big
belly
straining
at
the
laces
of
his
spotted
doeskin
jerkin.
A
shaggy
untrimmed
beard
covered
his
cheeks
and
chin,
the
color
of
old
gold.
“We
have
trout
enough
for
three,
ser,”
he
called
out.

It
was
not
the
first
time
Brienne
had
been
mistaken
for
a
man.
She
pulled
off
her
greathelm,
letting
her
hair
spill
free.
It
was
yellow,
the
color
of
dirty
straw,
and
near
as
brittle.
Long
and
thin,
it
blew
about
her
shoulders.
“I
thank
you,
ser.”

The
hedge
knight
squinted
at
her
so
earnestly
that
she
realized
he
must
be
nearsighted.
“A
lady,
is
it?
Armed
and
armored?
Illy,
gods
be
good,
the
size
of
her.”

“I
took
her
for
a
knight
as
well,”
the
older
knight
said,
turning
the
trout.

Had
Brienne
been
a
man,
she
would
have
been
called
big;
for
a
woman,
she
was
huge.
Freakish
was
the
word
she
had
heard
all
her
life.
She
was
broad
in
the
shoulder
and
broader
in
the
hips.
Her
legs
were
long,
her
arms
thick.
Her
chest
was
more
muscle
than
bosom.
Her
hands
were
big,
her
feet
enormous.
And
she
was
ugly
besides,
with
a
freckled,
horsey
face
and
teeth
that
seemed
almost
too
big
for
her
mouth.
She
did
not
need
to
be
reminded
of
any
of
that.
“Sers,”
she
said,
“have
you
seen
a
maid
of
three-and-ten
upon
the
road?
She
has
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair,
and
may
have
been
in
company
with
a
portly
red-faced
man
of
forty
years.”

The
nearsighted
hedge
knight
scratched
his
head.
“I
recall
no
such
maid.
What
sort
of
hair
is
auburn?”

“Browny
red,”
said
the
older
man.
“No,
we
saw
her
not.”

“We
saw
her
not,
m’lady,”
the
younger
told
her.
“Come,
dismount,
the
fish
is
almost
done.
Are
you
hungry?”

She
was,
as
it
happened,
but
she
was
wary
as
well.
Hedge
knights
had
an
unsavory
reputation.
“A
hedge
knight
and
a
robber
knight
are
two
sides
of
the
same
sword,”
it
was
said.
These
two
do
not
look
too
dangerous.
“Might
I
know
your
names,
sers?”

“I
have
the
honor
to
be
Ser
Creighton
Longbough,
of
whom
the
singers
sing,”
said
the
big-bellied
one.
“You
will
have
heard
of
my
deeds
on
the
Blackwater,
mayhaps.
My
companion
is
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless.”

If
there
was
a
song
about
Creighton
Longbough,
it
was
not
one
Brienne
had
heard.
Their
names
meant
no
more
to
her
than
did
their
arms.
Ser
Creighton’s
green
shield
showed
only
a
brown
chief,
and
a
deep
gouge
made
by
some
battle-axe.
Ser
Illifer
bore
gold
and
ermine
gyronny,
though
everything
about
him
suggested
that
painted
gold
and
painted
ermine
were
the
only
sorts
he’d
ever
known.
He
was
sixty
if
he
was
a
day,
his
face
pinched
and
narrow
beneath
the
hood
of
a
patched
roughspun
mantle.
Mail-clad
he
went,
but
flecks
of
rust
spotted
the
iron
like
freckles.
Brienne
stood
a
head
taller
than
either
of
them,
and
was
better
mounted
and
better
armed
in
the
bargain.
If
I
fear
the
likes
of
these,
I
had
as
well
swap
my
longsword
for
a
pair
of
knitting
needles.

“I
thank
you,
good
sers,”
she
said.
“I
will
gladly
share
your
trout.”
Swinging
down,
Brienne
unsaddled
her
mare
and
watered
her
before
hobbling
her
to
graze.
She
stacked
her
arms
and
shield
and
saddlebags
beneath
an
elm.
By
then
the
trout
was
crisply
done.
Ser
Creighton
brought
her
a
fish,
and
she
sat
cross-legged
on
the
ground
to
eat
it.

“We
are
bound
for
Duskendale,
m’lady,”
Longbough
told
her,
as
he
pulled
apart
his
own
trout
with
his
fingers.
“You
would
do
well
to
ride
with
us.
The
roads
are
perilous.”

Brienne
could
have
told
him
more
about
the
perils
of
the
roads
than
he
might
have
cared
to
know.
“I
thank
you,
ser,
but
I
have
no
need
of
your
protection.”

“I
insist.
A
true
knight
must
defend
the
gentler
sex.”

She
touched
her
sword
hilt.
“This
will
defend
me,
ser.”

“A
sword
is
only
as
good
as
the
man
who
wields
it.”

“I
wield
it
well
enough.”

“As
you
will.
It
would
not
be
courteous
to
argue
with
a
lady.
We
will
see
you
safe
to
Duskendale.
Three
together
may
ride
more
safely
than
one
alone.”

We
were
three
when
we
set
out
from
Riverrun,
yet
Jaime
lost
his
hand
and
Cleos
Frey
his
life.
“Your
mounts
could
not
keep
up
with
mine.”
Ser
Creighton’s
brown
gelding
was
an
old
swaybacked
creature
with
rheumy
eyes,
and
Ser
Illifer’s
horse
looked
weedy
and
half-starved.

“My
steed
served
me
well
enough
on
the
Blackwater,”
Ser
Creighton
insisted.
“Why,
I
did
great
carnage
there
and
won
a
dozen
ransoms.
Was
m’lady
familiar
with
Ser
Herbert
Bolling?
You
shall
never
meet
him
now.
I
slew
him
where
he
stood.
When
swords
clash,
you
shall
ne’er
find
Ser
Creighton
Longbough
to
the
rear.”

His
companion
gave
a
dry
chuckle.
“Creigh,
leave
off.
The
likes
o’
her
has
no
need
for
the
likes
o’
us.”

“The
likes
of
me?”
Brienne
was
uncertain
what
he
meant.

Ser
Illifer
crooked
a
bony
finger
at
her
shield.
Though
its
paint
was
cracked
and
peeling,
the
device
it
bore
showed
plain:
a
black
bat
on
a
field
divided
bendwise,
silver
and
gold.
“You
bear
a
liar’s
shield,
to
which
you
have
no
right.
My
grandfather’s
grandfather
helped
kill
the
last
o’
Lothston.
None
since
has
dared
to
show
that
bat,
black
as
the
deeds
of
them
that
bore
it.”

The
shield
was
the
one
Ser
Jaime
had
taken
from
the
armory
at
Harrenhal.
Brienne
had
found
it
in
the
stables
with
her
mare,
along
with
much
else;
saddle
and
bridle,
chainmail
hauberk
and
visored
greathelm,
purses
of
gold
and
silver
and
a
parchment
more
valuable
than
either.
“I
lost
mine
own
shield,”
she
explained.

“A
true
knight
is
the
only
shield
a
maiden
needs,”
declared
Ser
Creighton
stoutly.

Ser
Illifer
paid
him
no
mind.
“A
barefoot
man
looks
for
a
boot,
a
chilly
man
a
cloak.
But
who
would
cloak
themselves
in
shame?
Lord
Lucas
bore
that
bat,
the
Pander,
and
Manfryd
o’
the
Black
Hood,
his
son.
Why
wear
such
arms,
I
ask
myself,
unless
your
own
sin
is
fouler
still...
and
fresher.”
He
unsheathed
his
dagger,
an
ugly
piece
of
cheap
iron.
“A
woman
freakish
big
and
freakish
strong
who
hides
her
own
true
colors.
Creigh,
behold
the
Maid
o’
Tarth,
who
opened
Renly’s
royal
throat
for
him.”

“That
is
a
lie.”
Renly
Baratheon
had
been
more
than
a
king
to
her.
She
had
loved
him
since
first
he
came
to
Tarth
on
his
leisurely
lord’s
progress,
to
mark
his
coming
of
age.
Her
father
welcomed
him
with
a
feast
and
commanded
her
to
attend;
elsewise
she
would
have
hidden
in
her
room
like
some
wounded
beast.
She
had
been
no
older
than
Sansa,
more
afraid
of
sniggers
than
of
swords.
They
will
know
about
the
rose,
she
told
Lord
Selwyn,
they
will
laugh
at
me.
But
the
Evenstar
would
not
relent.

And
Renly
Baratheon
had
shown
her
every
courtesy,
as
if
she
were
a
proper
maid,
and
pretty.
He
even
danced
with
her,
and
in
his
arms
she’d
felt
graceful,
and
her
feet
had
floated
across
the
floor.
Later
others
begged
a
dance
of
her,
because
of
his
example.
From
that
day
forth,
she
wanted
only
to
be
close
to
Lord
Renly,
to
serve
him
and
protect
him.
But
in
the
end
she
failed
him.
Renly
died
in
my
arms,
but
I
did
not
kill
him,
she
thought,
but
these
hedge
knights
would
never
understand.
“I
would
have
given
my
life
for
King
Renly,
and
died
happy,”
she
said.
“I
did
no
harm
to
him.
I
swear
it
by
my
sword.”

“A
knight
swears
by
his
sword,”
Ser
Creighton
said.

“Swear
it
by
the
Seven,”
urged
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless.

“By
the
Seven,
then.
I
did
no
harm
to
King
Renly.
I
swear
it
by
the
Mother.
May
I
never
know
her
mercy
if
I
lie.
I
swear
it
by
the
Father,
and
ask
that
he
might
judge
me
justly.
I
swear
it
by
the
Maiden
and
Crone,
by
the
Smith
and
the
Warrior.
And
I
swear
it
by
the
Stranger,
may
he
take
me
now
if
I
am
false.”

“She
swears
well,
for
a
maid,”
Ser
Creighton
allowed.

“Aye.”
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless
gave
a
shrug.
“Well,
if
she’s
lied,
the
gods
will
sort
her
out.”
He
slipped
his
dagger
back
away.
“The
first
watch
is
yours.”

As
the
hedge
knights
slept,
Brienne
paced
restlessly
around
the
little
camp,
listening
to
the
crackle
of
the
fire.
I
should
ride
on
whilst
I
can.
She
did
not
know
these
men,
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
them
undefended.
Even
in
the
black
of
night,
there
were
riders
on
the
road,
and
noises
in
the
woods
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
owls
and
prowling
foxes.
So
Brienne
paced,
and
kept
her
blade
loose
in
its
scabbard.

Her
watch
was
easy,
all
in
all.
It
was
after
that
was
hard,
when
Ser
Illifer
woke
and
said
he
would
relieve
her.
Brienne
spread
a
blanket
on
the
ground,
and
curled
up
to
close
her
eyes.
I
will
not
sleep,
she
told
herself,
bone
weary
though
she
was.
She
had
never
slept
easily
in
the
presence
of
men.
Even
in
Lord
Renly’s
camps,
the
risk
of
rape
was
always
there.
It
was
a
lesson
she
had
learned
beneath
the
walls
of
Highgarden,
and
again
when
she
and
Jaime
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Brave
Companions.

The
cold
in
the
earth
seeped
through
Brienne’s
blankets
to
soak
into
her
bones.
Before
long
every
muscle
felt
clenched
and
cramped,
from
her
jaw
down
to
her
toes.
She
wondered
whether
Sansa
Stark
was
cold
as
well,
wherever
she
might
be.
Lady
Catelyn
had
said
that
Sansa
was
a
gentle
soul
who
loved
lemon
cakes,
silken
gowns,
and
songs
of
chivalry,
yet
the
girl
had
seen
her
father’s
head
lopped
off
and
been
forced
to
marry
one
of
his
killers
afterward.
If
half
the
tales
were
true,
the
dwarf
was
the
cruelest
Lannister
of
all.
If
she
did
poison
King
Joffrey,
the
Imp
surely
forced
her
hand.
She
was
alone
and
friendless
at
that
court.
In
King’s
Landing,
Brienne
had
hunted
down
a
certain
Brella,
who
had
been
one
of
Sansa’s
maids.
The
woman
told
her
that
there
was
little
warmth
between
Sansa
and
the
dwarf.
Perhaps
she
had
been
fleeing
him
as
well
as
Joffrey’s
murder.

Whatever
dreams
Brienne
dreamed
were
gone
when
dawn
awoke
her.
Her
legs
were
stiff
as
wood
from
the
cold
ground,
but
no
one
had
molested
her,
and
her
goods
remained
untouched.
The
hedge
knights
were
up
and
about.
Ser
Illifer
was
cutting
up
a
squirrel
for
breakfast,
while
Ser
Creighton
stood
facing
a
tree,
having
himself
a
good
long
piss.
Hedge
knights,
she
thought,
old
and
vain
and
plump
and
nearsighted,
yet
decent
men
for
all
that.
It
cheered
her
to
know
that
there
were
still
decent
men
in
the
world.

They
broke
their
fast
on
roast
squirrel,
acorn
paste,
and
pickles,
whilst
Ser
Creighton
regaled
her
with
his
exploits
on
the
Blackwater,
where
he
had
slain
a
dozen
fearsome
knights
that
she
had
never
heard
of.
“Oh,
it
was
a
rare
fight,
m’lady,”
he
said,
“a
rare
and
bloody
fray.”
He
allowed
that
Ser
Illifer
had
fought
nobly
in
the
battle
as
well.
Illifer
himself
said
little.

When
time
came
to
resume
their
journey,
the
knights
fell
in
on
either
side
of
her,
like
guards
protecting
some
great
lady...
though
this
lady
dwarfed
both
of
her
protectors
and
was
better
armed
and
armored
in
the
nonce.
“Did
anyone
pass
by
during
your
watches?”
Brienne
asked
them.

“Such
as
a
maid
of
three-and-ten,
with
auburn
hair?”
said
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless.
“No,
my
lady.
No
one.”

“I
had
a
few,”
Ser
Creighton
put
in.
“Some
farm
boy
on
a
piebald
horse
went
by,
and
an
hour
later
half
a
dozen
men
afoot
with
staves
and
scythes.
They
caught
sight
of
our
fire,
and
stopped
for
a
long
look
at
our
horses,
but
I
showed
them
a
glimpse
of
my
steel
and
told
them
to
be
along
their
way.
Rough
fellows,
by
the
look
o’
them,
and
desperate
too,
but
ne’er
so
desperate
as
to
trifle
with
Ser
Creighton
Longbough.”

No,
Brienne
thought,
not
so
desperate
as
that.
She
turned
away
to
hide
her
smile.
Thankfully,
Ser
Creighton
was
too
intent
on
the
tale
of
his
epic
battle
with
the
Knight
of
the
Red
Chicken
to
make
note
of
the
maiden’s
mirth.
It
felt
good
to
have
companions
on
the
road,
even
such
companions
as
these
two.

It
was
midday
when
Brienne
heard
chanting
drifting
through
the
bare
brown
trees.
“What
is
that
sound?”
Ser
Creighton
asked.

“Voices,
raised
in
prayer.”
Brienne
knew
the
chant.
They
are
beseeching
the
Warrior
for
protection,
asking
the
Crone
to
light
their
way.

Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless
bared
his
battered
blade
and
reined
in
his
horse
to
wait
their
coming.
“They
are
close
now.”

The
chanting
filled
the
woods
like
pious
thunder.
And
suddenly
the
source
of
the
sound
appeared
in
the
road
ahead.
A
group
of
begging
brothers
led
the
way,
scruffy
bearded
men
in
roughspun
robes,
some
barefoot
and
some
in
sandals.
Behind
them
marched
threescore
ragged
men,
women,
and
children,
a
spotted
sow,
and
several
sheep.
Several
of
the
men
had
axes,
and
more
had
crude
wooden
clubs
and
cudgels.
In
their
midst
there
rolled
a
two-wheeled
wayn
of
grey
and
splintered
wood,
piled
high
with
skulls
and
broken
bits
of
bone.
When
they
saw
the
hedge
knights,
the
begging
brothers
halted,
and
the
chanting
died
away.
“Good
knights,”
one
said,
“the
Mother
loves
you.”

“And
you,
brother,”
said
Ser
Illifer.
“Who
are
you?”

“Poor
fellows,”
said
a
big
man
with
an
axe.
Despite
the
chill
of
the
autumnal
wood,
he
was
shirtless,
and
on
his
breast
was
carved
a
seven-pointed
star.
Andal
warriors
had
carved
such
stars
in
their
flesh
when
first
they
crossed
the
narrow
sea
to
overwhelm
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men.

“We
are
marching
to
the
city,”
said
a
tall
woman
in
the
traces
of
the
wayn,
“to
bring
these
holy
bones
to
Blessed
Baelor,
and
seek
succor
and
protection
from
the
king.”

“Join
us,
friends,”
urged
a
spare
small
man
in
a
threadbare
septon’s
robe,
who
wore
a
crystal
on
a
thong
about
his
neck.
“Westeros
has
need
of
every
sword.”

“We
were
bound
for
Duskendale,”
declared
Ser
Creighton,
“but
mayhaps
we
could
see
you
safely
to
King’s
Landing.”

“If
you
have
the
coin
to
pay
us
for
this
escort,”
added
Ser
Illifer,
who
seemed
practical
as
well
as
penniless.

“Sparrows
need
no
gold,”
the
septon
said.

Ser
Creighton
was
lost.
“Sparrows?”

“The
sparrow
is
the
humblest
and
most
common
of
birds,
as
we
are
the
humblest
and
most
common
of
men.”
The
septon
had
a
lean
sharp
face
and
a
short
beard,
grizzled
grey
and
brown.
His
thin
hair
was
pulled
back
and
knotted
behind
his
head,
and
his
feet
were
bare
and
black,
gnarled
and
hard
as
tree
roots.
“These
are
the
bones
of
holy
men,
murdered
for
their
faith.
They
served
the
Seven
even
unto
death.
Some
starved,
some
were
tortured.
Septs
have
been
despoiled,
maidens
and
mothers
raped
by
godless
men
and
demon
worshipers.
Even
silent
sisters
have
been
molested.
Our
Mother
Above
cries
out
in
her
anguish.
It
is
time
for
all
anointed
knights
to
forsake
their
worldly
masters
and
defend
our
Holy
Faith.
Come
with
us
to
the
city,
if
you
love
the
Seven.”

“I
love
them
well
enough,”
said
Illifer,
“yet
I
must
eat.”

“So
must
all
the
Mother’s
children.”

“We
are
bound
for
Duskendale,”
Ser
Illifer
said
flatly.

One
of
the
begging
brothers
spat,
and
a
woman
gave
a
moan.
“You
are
false
knights,”
said
the
big
man
with
the
star
carved
on
his
chest.
Several
others
brandished
their
cudgels.

The
barefoot
septon
calmed
them
with
a
word.
“Judge
not,
for
judgment
is
the
Father’s.
Let
them
pass
in
peace.
They
are
poor
fellows
too,
lost
upon
the
earth.”

Brienne
edged
her
mare
forward.
“My
sister
is
lost
as
well.
A
girl
of
three-and-ten
with
auburn
hair,
fair
to
look
upon.”

“All
the
Mother’s
children
are
fair
to
look
upon.
May
the
Maiden
watch
over
this
poor
girl...
and
you
as
well,
I
think.”
The
septon
lifted
one
of
the
traces
of
the
wayn
upon
his
shoulder,
and
began
to
pull.
The
begging
brothers
took
up
the
chant
once
more.
Brienne
and
the
hedge
knights
sat
upon
their
horses
as
the
procession
moved
slowly
past,
following
the
rutted
road
toward
Rosby.
The
sound
of
their
chanting
slowly
dwindled
away
and
died.

Ser
Creighton
lifted
one
cheek
off
the
saddle
to
scratch
his
arse.
“What
sort
of
man
would
slay
a
holy
septon?”

Brienne
knew
what
sort.
Near
Maidenpool,
she
recalled,
the
Brave
Companions
had
strung
a
septon
up
by
his
heels
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
and
used
his
corpse
for
archery
practice.
She
wondered
if
his
bones
were
piled
in
that
wayn
with
all
the
rest.

“A
man
would
need
to
be
a
fool
to
rape
a
silent
sister,”
Ser
Creighton
was
saying.
“Even
to
lay
hands
upon
one...
it’s
said
they
are
the
Stranger’s
wives,
and
their
female
parts
are
cold
and
wet
as
ice.”
He
glanced
at
Brienne.
“Uh...
beg
pardon.”

Brienne
spurred
her
mare
toward
Duskendale.
After
a
moment,
Ser
Illifer
followed,
and
Ser
Creighton
came
bringing
up
the
rear.

Three
hours
later
they
came
up
upon
another
party
struggling
toward
Duskendale;
a
merchant
and
his
serving
men,
accompanied
by
yet
another
hedge
knight.
The
merchant
rode
a
dappled
grey
mare,
whilst
his
servants
took
turns
pulling
his
wagon.
Four
labored
in
the
traces
as
the
other
two
walked
beside
the
wheels,
but
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
horses
they
formed
up
around
the
wagon
with
quarterstaffs
of
ash
at
the
ready.
The
merchant
produced
a
crossbow,
the
knight
a
blade.
“You
will
forgive
me
if
I
am
suspicious,”
called
the
merchant,
“but
the
times
are
troubled,
and
I
have
only
good
Ser
Shadrich
to
defend
me.
Who
are
you?”

“Why,”
Ser
Creighton
said,
affronted,
“I
am
the
famous
Ser
Creighton
Longbough,
fresh
from
battle
on
the
Blackwater,
and
this
is
my
companion,
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless.”

“We
mean
you
no
harm,”
said
Brienne.

The
merchant
considered
her
doubtfully.
“My
lady,
you
should
be
safe
at
home.
Why
do
you
wear
such
unnatural
garb?”

“I
am
searching
for
my
sister.”
She
dared
not
mention
Sansa’s
name,
with
her
accused
of
regicide.
“She
is
a
highborn
maid
and
beautiful,
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
Perhaps
you
saw
her
with
a
portly
knight
of
forty
years,
or
a
drunken
fool.”

“The
roads
are
full
of
drunken
fools
and
despoiled
maidens.
As
to
portly
knights,
it
is
hard
for
any
honest
man
to
keep
his
belly
round
when
so
many
lack
for
food...
though
your
Ser
Creighton
has
not
hungered,
it
would
seem.”

“I
have
big
bones,”
Ser
Creighton
insisted.
“Shall
we
ride
together
for
a
time?
I
do
not
doubt
Ser
Shadrich’s
valor,
but
he
seems
small,
and
three
blades
are
better
than
one.”

Four
blades,
thought
Brienne,
but
she
held
her
tongue.

The
merchant
looked
to
his
escort.
“What
say
you,
ser?”

“Oh,
these
three
are
nought
to
fear.”
Ser
Shadrich
was
a
wiry,
fox-faced
man
with
a
sharp
nose
and
a
shock
of
orange
hair,
mounted
on
a
rangy
chestnut
courser.
Though
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
five
foot
two,
he
had
a
cocksure
manner.
“The
one
is
old,
t’other
fat,
and
the
big
one
is
a
woman.
Let
them
come.”

“As
you
say.”
The
merchant
lowered
his
crossbow.

As
they
resumed
their
journey,
the
hired
knight
dropped
back
and
looked
her
up
and
down
as
if
she
were
a
side
of
good
salt
pork.
“You’re
a
strapping
healthy
wench,
I’d
say.”

Ser
Jaime’s
mockery
had
cut
her
deep;
the
little
man’s
words
hardly
touched
her.
“A
giant,
compared
to
some.”

He
laughed.
“I
am
big
enough
where
it
counts,
wench.”

“The
merchant
called
you
Shadrich.”

“Ser
Shadrich
of
the
Shady
Glen.
Some
call
me
the
Mad
Mouse.”
He
turned
his
shield
to
show
her
his
sigil,
a
large
white
mouse
with
fierce
red
eyes,
on
bendy
brown
and
blue.
“The
brown
is
for
the
lands
I’ve
roamed,
the
blue
for
the
rivers
that
I’ve
crossed.
The
mouse
is
me.”

“And
are
you
mad?”

“Oh,
quite.
Your
common
mouse
will
run
from
blood
and
battle.
The
mad
mouse
seeks
them
out.”

“It
would
seem
he
seldom
finds
them.”

“I
find
enough.
’Tis
true,
I
am
no
tourney
knight.
I
save
my
valor
for
the
battlefield,
woman.”

Woman
was
marginally
better
than
wench,
she
supposed.
“You
and
good
Ser
Creighton
have
much
in
common,
then.”

Ser
Shadrich
laughed.
“Oh,
I
doubt
that,
but
it
may
be
that
you
and
I
share
a
quest.
A
little
lost
sister,
is
it?
With
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair?”
He
laughed
again.
“You
are
not
the
only
hunter
in
the
woods.
I
seek
for
Sansa
Stark
as
well.”

Brienne
kept
her
face
a
mask,
to
hide
her
dismay.
“Who
is
this
Sansa
Stark,
and
why
do
you
seek
her?”

“For
love,
why
else?”

She
furrowed
her
brow.
“Love?”

“Aye,
love
of
gold.
Unlike
your
good
Ser
Creighton,
I
did
fight
upon
the
Blackwater,
but
on
the
losing
side.
My
ransom
ruined
me.
You
know
who
Varys
is,
I
trust?
The
eunuch
has
offered
a
plump
bag
of
gold
for
this
girl
you’ve
never
heard
of.
I
am
not
a
greedy
man.
If
some
oversized
wench
would
help
me
find
this
naughty
child,
I
would
split
the
Spider’s
coin
with
her.”

“I
thought
you
were
in
this
merchant’s
hire.”

“Only
so
far
as
Duskendale.
Hibald
is
as
niggardly
as
he
is
fearful.
And
he
is
very
fearful.
What
say
you,
wench?”

“I
know
no
Sansa
Stark,”
she
insisted.
“I
am
searching
for
my
sister,
a
highborn
girl...”

“...with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair,
aye.
Pray,
who
is
this
knight
who
travels
with
your
sister?
Or
did
you
name
him
fool?”
Ser
Shadrich
did
not
wait
for
her
answer,
which
was
good,
since
she
had
none.
“A
certain
fool
vanished
from
King’s
Landing
the
night
King
Joffrey
died,
a
stout
fellow
with
a
nose
full
of
broken
veins,
one
Ser
Dontos
the
Red,
formerly
of
Duskendale.
I
pray
your
sister
and
her
drunken
fool
are
not
mistaken
for
the
Stark
girl
and
Ser
Dontos.
That
could
be
most
unfortunate.”
He
put
his
heels
into
his
courser
and
trotted
on
ahead.

Even
Jaime
Lannister
had
seldom
made
Brienne
feel
such
a
fool.
You
are
not
the
only
hunter
in
the
woods.
The
woman
Brella
had
told
her
how
Joffrey
had
stripped
Ser
Dontos
of
his
spurs,
how
Lady
Sansa
begged
Joffrey
for
his
life.
He
helped
her
flee,
Brienne
had
decided,
when
she
heard
the
tale.
Find
Ser
Dontos,
and
I
will
find
Sansa.
She
should
have
known
there
would
be
others
who
would
see
it
too.
Some
may
even
be
less
savory
than
Ser
Shadrich.
She
could
only
hope
that
Ser
Dontos
had
hidden
Sansa
well.
But
if
so,
how
will
I
ever
find
her?

She
hunched
her
shoulders
down
and
rode
on,
frowning.

Night
was
gathering
by
the
time
their
party
came
upon
the
inn,
a
tall,
timbered
building
that
stood
beside
a
river
junction,
astride
an
old
stone
bridge.
That
was
the
inn’s
name,
Ser
Creighton
told
them:
the
Old
Stone
Bridge.
The
innkeep
was
a
friend
of
his.
“Not
a
bad
cook,
and
the
rooms
have
no
more
fleas
than
most,”
he
vouched.
“Who’s
for
a
warm
bed
tonight?”

“Not
us,
unless
your
friend
is
giving
them
away,”
said
Ser
Illifer
the
Penniless.
“We
have
no
coin
for
rooms.”

“I
can
pay
for
the
three
of
us.”
Brienne
did
not
lack
for
coin;
Jaime
had
seen
to
that.
In
her
saddlebags
she’d
found
a
purse
fat
with
silver
stags
and
copper
stars,
a
smaller
one
stuffed
with
golden
dragons,
and
a
parchment
commanding
all
loyal
subjects
of
the
king
to
assist
the
bearer,
Brienne
of
House
Tarth,
who
was
about
His
Grace’s
business.
It
was
signed
in
a
childish
hand
by
Tommen,
the
First
of
His
Name,
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

Hibald
was
for
stopping
too,
and
bid
his
men
to
leave
the
wagon
near
the
stables.
Warm
yellow
light
shone
through
the
diamond-shaped
panes
of
the
inn’s
windows,
and
Brienne
heard
a
stallion
trumpet
at
the
scent
of
her
mare.
She
was
loosening
the
saddle
when
a
boy
came
out
the
stable
door,
and
said,
“Let
me
do
that,
ser.”

“I
am
no
ser,”
she
told
him,
“but
you
may
take
the
horse.
See
that
she
is
fed
and
brushed
and
watered.”

The
boy
reddened.
“Beg
pardons,
m’lady.
I
thought...”

“It
is
a
common
mistake.”
Brienne
gave
him
the
reins
and
followed
the
others
into
the
inn,
with
her
saddlebags
across
a
shoulder
and
her
bedroll
tucked
up
beneath
one
arm.

Sawdust
covered
the
plank
floor
of
the
common
room,
and
the
air
smelled
of
hops
and
smoke
and
meat.
A
roast
was
spitting
and
crackling
over
the
fire,
unattended
for
the
moment.
Six
locals
sat
about
a
table,
talking,
but
they
broke
off
when
the
strangers
entered.
Brienne
could
feel
their
eyes.
Despite
chainmail,
cloak,
and
jerkin,
she
felt
naked.
When
one
man
said,
“Have
a
look
at
that,”
she
knew
he
was
not
speaking
of
Ser
Shadrich.

The
innkeep
appeared,
clutching
three
tankards
in
each
hand
and
slopping
ale
at
every
step.

“Do
you
have
rooms,
good
man?”
the
merchant
asked
him.

“I
might,”
the
innkeep
said,
“for
them
as
has
coin.”

Ser
Creighton
Longbough
looked
offended.
“Naggle,
is
that
how
you
would
greet
an
old
friend?
’Tis
me,
Longbough.”

“’Tis
you
indeed.
You
owe
me
seven
stags.
Show
me
some
silver
and
I’ll
show
you
a
bed.”
The
innkeep
set
the
tankards
down
one
by
one,
slopping
more
ale
on
the
table
in
the
process.

“I
will
pay
for
one
room
for
myself,
and
a
second
for
my
two
companions.”
Brienne
indicated
Ser
Creighton
and
Ser
Illifer.

“I
shall
take
a
room
as
well,”
said
the
merchant,
“for
myself
and
good
Ser
Shadrich.
My
serving
men
will
bed
down
in
your
stables,
if
it
please
you.”

The
innkeep
looked
them
over.
“It
don’t
please
me,
but
might
be
I’ll
allow
it.
Will
you
be
wanting
supper?
That’s
good
goat
on
the
spit,
that
is.”

“I
shall
judge
its
goodness
for
myself,”
Hibald
announced.
“My
men
will
content
themselves
with
bread
and
drippings.”

And
so
they
supped.
Brienne
tried
the
goat
herself,
after
following
the
innkeep
up
the
steps,
pressing
some
coins
into
his
hand,
and
stashing
her
goods
in
the
second
room
he
showed
her.
She
ordered
goat
for
Ser
Creighton
and
Ser
Illifer
as
well,
since
they
had
shared
their
trout
with
her.
The
hedge
knights
and
the
septon
washed
down
the
meat
with
ale,
but
Brienne
drank
a
cup
of
goat’s
milk.
She
listened
to
the
table
talk,
hoping
against
hope
that
she
might
hear
something
that
would
help
her
find
Sansa.

“You
come
from
King’s
Landing,”
one
of
the
locals
said
to
Hibald.
“Is
it
true
that
the
Kingslayer’s
been
crippled?”

“True
enough,”
Hibald
said.
“He’s
lost
his
sword
hand.”

“Aye,”
Ser
Creighton
said,
“chewed
off
by
a
direwolf,
I
hear,
one
of
them
monsters
come
down
from
the
north.
Nought
that’s
good
ever
come
from
the
north.
Even
their
gods
are
queer.”

“It
was
not
a
wolf,”
Brienne
heard
herself
say.
“Ser
Jaime
lost
his
hand
to
a
Qohorik
sellsword.”

“It
is
no
easy
thing
to
fight
with
your
off
hand,”
observed
the
Mad
Mouse.

“Bah,”
said
Ser
Creighton
Longbough.
“As
it
happens,
I
fight
as
well
with
either
hand.”

“Oh,
I
have
no
doubt
of
that.”
Ser
Shadrich
lifted
his
tankard
in
salute.

Brienne
remembered
her
fight
with
Jaime
Lannister
in
the
woods.
It
had
been
all
that
she
could
do
to
keep
his
blade
at
bay.
He
was
weak
from
his
imprisonment,
and
chained
at
the
wrists.
No
knight
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
could
have
stood
against
him
at
his
full
strength,
with
no
chains
to
hamper
him.
Jaime
had
done
many
wicked
things,
but
the
man
could
fight!
His
maiming
had
been
monstrously
cruel.
It
was
one
thing
to
slay
a
lion,
another
to
hack
his
paw
off
and
leave
him
broken
and
bewildered.

Suddenly
the
common
room
was
too
loud
to
endure
a
moment
longer.
She
muttered
her
good-nights
and
took
herself
up
to
bed.
The
ceiling
in
her
room
was
low;
entering
with
a
taper
in
her
hand,
Brienne
had
to
duck
or
crack
her
head.
The
only
furnishings
were
a
bed
wide
enough
to
sleep
six,
and
the
stub
of
a
tallow
candle
on
the
sill.
She
lit
it
with
the
taper,
barred
the
door,
and
hung
her
sword
belt
from
a
bedpost.
Her
scabbard
was
a
plain
thing,
wood
wrapped
in
cracked
brown
leather,
and
her
sword
was
plainer
still.
She
had
bought
it
in
King’s
Landing,
to
replace
the
blade
the
Brave
Companions
had
stolen.
Renly’s
sword.
It
still
hurt,
knowing
she
had
lost
it.

But
she
had
another
longsword
hidden
in
her
bedroll.
She
sat
on
the
bed
and
took
it
out.
Gold
glimmered
yellow
in
the
candlelight
and
rubies
smoldered
red.
When
she
slid
Oathkeeper
from
the
ornate
scabbard,
Brienne’s
breath
caught
in
her
throat.
Black
and
red
the
ripples
ran,
deep
within
the
steel.
Valyrian
steel,
spell-forged.
It
was
a
sword
fit
for
a
hero.
When
she
was
small,
her
nurse
had
filled
her
ears
with
tales
of
valor,
regaling
her
with
the
noble
exploits
of
Ser
Galladon
of
Morne,
Florian
the
Fool,
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
and
other
champions.
Each
man
bore
a
famous
sword,
and
surely
Oathkeeper
belonged
in
their
company,
even
if
she
herself
did
not.
“You’ll
be
defending
Ned
Stark’s
daughter
with
Ned
Stark’s
own
steel,”
Jaime
had
promised.

Kneeling
between
the
bed
and
wall,
she
held
the
blade
and
said
a
silent
prayer
to
the
Crone,
whose
golden
lamp
showed
men
the
way
through
life.
Lead
me,
she
prayed,
light
the
way
before
me,
show
me
the
path
that
leads
to
Sansa.
She
had
failed
Renly,
had
failed
Lady
Catelyn.
She
must
not
fail
Jaime.
He
trusted
me
with
his
sword.
He
trusted
me
with
his
honor.

Afterward
she
stretched
out
on
the
bed
as
best
she
could.
For
all
its
width
it
was
not
long
enough,
so
Brienne
lay
across
it
sideways.
She
could
hear
the
clatter
of
tankards
from
below,
and
voices
drifting
up
the
steps.
The
fleas
that
Longbough
had
spoken
of
put
in
their
appearance.
Scratching
helped
keep
her
awake.

She
heard
Hibald
mount
the
stairs,
and
sometime
later
the
knights
as
well.
“...I
never
knew
his
name,”
Ser
Creighton
was
saying
as
he
went
by,
“but
upon
his
shield
he
bore
a
blood-red
chicken,
and
his
blade
was
dripping
gore...”
His
voice
faded,
and
somewhere
up
above,
a
door
opened
and
closed.

Her
candle
burned
out.
Darkness
settled
over
the
Old
Stone
Bridge,
and
the
inn
grew
so
still
that
she
could
hear
the
murmur
of
the
river.
Only
then
did
Brienne
rise
to
gather
up
her
things.
She
eased
the
door
open,
listened,
made
her
way
barefoot
down
the
steps.
Outside
she
donned
her
boots
and
hurried
to
the
stables
to
saddle
her
bay
mare,
asking
a
silent
pardon
of
Ser
Creighton
and
Ser
Illifer
as
she
mounted.
One
of
Hibald’s
serving
men
woke
when
she
rode
past
him,
but
made
no
move
to
stop
her.
Her
mare’s
hooves
rang
upon
the
old
stone
bridge.
Then
the
trees
closed
in
around
her,
black
as
pitch
and
full
of
ghosts
and
memories.
I
am
coming
for
you,
Lady
Sansa,
she
thought
as
she
rode
into
the
darkness.
Be
not
afraid.
I
shall
not
rest
until
I’ve
found
you.





SAMWELL

Sam
was
reading
about
the
Others
when
he
saw
the
mouse.

His
eyes
were
red
and
raw.
I
ought
not
rub
them
so
much,
he
always
told
himself
as
he
rubbed
them.
The
dust
made
them
itch
and
water,
and
the
dust
was
everywhere
down
here.
Little
puffs
of
it
filled
the
air
every
time
a
page
was
turned,
and
it
rose
in
grey
clouds
whenever
he
shifted
a
stack
of
books
to
see
what
might
be
hiding
on
the
bottom.

Sam
did
not
know
how
long
it
had
been
since
last
he’d
slept,
but
scarce
an
inch
remained
of
the
fat
tallow
candle
he’d
lit
when
starting
on
the
ragged
bundle
of
loose
pages
that
he’d
found
tied
up
in
twine.
He
was
beastly
tired,
but
it
was
hard
to
stop.
One
more
book,
he
had
told
himself,
then
I’ll
stop.
One
more
folio,
just
one
more.
One
more
page,
then
I’ll
go
up
and
rest
and
get
a
bite
to
eat.
But
there
was
always
another
page
after
that
one,
and
another
after
that,
and
another
book
waiting
underneath
the
pile.
I’ll
just
take
a
quick
peek
to
see
what
this
one
is
about,
he’d
think,
and
before
he
knew
he
would
be
halfway
through
it.
He
had
not
eaten
since
that
bowl
of
bean-and-bacon
soup
with
Pyp
and
Grenn.
Well,
except
for
the
bread
and
cheese,
but
that
was
only
a
nibble,
he
thought.
That
was
when
he
took
a
quick
glance
at
the
empty
platter,
and
spied
the
mouse
feasting
on
the
bread
crumbs.

The
mouse
was
half
as
long
as
his
pinky
finger,
with
black
eyes
and
soft
grey
fur.
Sam
knew
he
ought
to
kill
it.
Mice
might
prefer
bread
and
cheese,
but
they
ate
paper
too.
He
had
found
plenty
of
mouse
droppings
amongst
the
shelves
and
stacks,
and
some
of
the
leather
covers
on
the
books
showed
signs
of
being
gnawed.

It
is
such
a
little
thing,
though.
And
hungry.
How
could
he
begrudge
it
a
few
crumbs?
It’s
eating
books,
though...

After
hours
in
the
chair
Sam’s
back
was
stiff
as
a
board,
and
his
legs
were
half-asleep.
He
knew
he
was
not
quick
enough
to
catch
the
mouse,
but
it
might
be
he
could
squash
it.
By
his
elbow
rested
a
massive
leather-bound
copy
of
Annals
of
the
Black
Centaur,
Septon
Jorquen’s
exhaustively
detailed
account
of
the
nine
years
that
Orbert
Caswell
had
served
as
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
There
was
a
page
for
each
day
of
his
term,
every
one
of
which
seemed
to
begin,
“Lord
Orbert
rose
at
dawn
and
moved
his
bowels,”
except
for
the
last,
which
said,
“Lord
Orbert
was
found
to
have
died
during
the
night.”

No
mouse
is
a
match
for
Septon
Jorquen.
Very
slowly,
Sam
took
hold
of
the
book
with
his
left
hand.
It
was
thick
and
heavy,
and
when
he
tried
to
lift
it
one-handed,
it
slipped
from
his
plump
fingers
and
thumped
back
down.
The
mouse
was
gone
in
half
a
heartbeat,
skittery-quick.
Sam
was
relieved.
Squishing
the
poor
little
thing
would
have
given
him
nightmares.
“You
shouldn’t
eat
the
books,
though,”
he
said
aloud.
Maybe
he
should
bring
more
cheese
the
next
time
he
came
down
here.

He
was
surprised
at
how
low
the
candle
had
burned.
Had
the
bean-and-bacon
soup
been
today
or
yesterday?
Yesterday.
It
must
have
been
yesterday.
The
realization
made
him
yawn.
Jon
would
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
him,
though
Maester
Aemon
would
no
doubt
understand.
Before
he
had
lost
his
sight,
the
maester
had
loved
books
as
much
as
Samwell
Tarly
did.
He
understood
the
way
that
you
could
sometimes
fall
right
into
them,
as
if
each
page
was
a
hole
into
another
world.

Pushing
himself
to
his
feet,
Sam
grimaced
at
the
pins
and
needles
in
his
calves.
The
chair
was
very
hard
and
cut
into
the
back
of
his
thighs
when
he
bent
over
a
book.
I
need
to
remember
to
bring
a
cushion.
It
would
be
even
better
if
he
could
sleep
down
here,
in
the
cell
he’d
found
half-hidden
behind
four
chests
full
of
loose
pages
that
had
gotten
separated
from
the
books
they
belonged
to,
but
he
did
not
want
to
leave
Maester
Aemon
alone
for
so
long.
He
had
not
been
strong
of
late
and
required
help,
especially
with
the
ravens.
Aemon
had
Clydas,
to
be
sure,
but
Sam
was
younger,
and
better
with
the
birds.

With
a
stack
of
books
and
scrolls
under
his
left
arm
and
the
candle
in
his
right
hand,
Sam
made
his
way
through
the
tunnels
the
brothers
called
the
wormways.
A
pale
shaft
of
light
illuminated
the
steep
stone
steps
that
led
up
to
the
surface,
so
he
knew
that
day
had
come
up
top.
He
left
the
candle
burning
in
a
wall
niche
and
began
the
climb.
By
the
fifth
step
he
was
puffing.
At
the
tenth
he
stopped
to
shift
the
books
to
his
right
arm.

He
emerged
beneath
a
sky
the
color
of
white
lead.
A
snow
sky,
Sam
thought,
squinting
up.
The
prospect
made
him
uneasy.
He
remembered
that
night
on
the
Fist
of
the
First
Men
when
the
wights
and
the
snows
had
come
together.
Don’t
be
so
craven,
he
thought.
You
have
your
Sworn
Brothers
all
around
you,
not
to
mention
Stannis
Baratheon
and
all
his
knights.
Castle
Black’s
keeps
and
towers
rose
about
him,
dwarfed
by
the
icy
immensity
of
the
Wall.
A
small
army
was
crawling
over
the
ice
a
quarter
of
the
way
up,
where
a
new
switchback
stair
was
creeping
upward
to
meet
the
remnants
of
the
old
one.
The
sounds
of
their
saws
and
hammers
echoed
off
the
ice.
Jon
had
the
builders
working
night
and
day
on
the
task.
Sam
had
heard
some
of
them
complaining
about
it
over
supper,
insisting
that
Lord
Mormont
never
worked
them
half
so
hard.
Without
the
great
stair
there
was
no
way
to
reach
the
top
of
the
Wall
except
by
the
chain
winch,
however.
And
as
much
as
Samwell
Tarly
hated
steps,
he
hated
the
winch
cage
more.
He
always
closed
his
eyes
when
he
was
riding
it,
convinced
that
the
chain
was
about
to
break.
Every
time
the
iron
cage
scraped
against
the
ice
his
heart
stopped
beating
for
an
instant.

There
were
dragons
here
two
hundred
years
ago,
Sam
found
himself
thinking,
as
he
watched
the
cage
making
a
slow
descent.
They
would
just
have
flown
to
the
top
of
the
Wall.
Queen
Alysanne
had
visited
Castle
Black
on
her
dragon,
and
Jaehaerys,
her
king,
had
come
after
her
on
his
own.
Could
Silverwing
have
left
an
egg
behind?
Or
had
Stannis
found
one
egg
on
Dragonstone?
Even
if
he
has
an
egg,
how
can
he
hope
to
quicken
it?
Baelor
the
Blessed
had
prayed
over
his
eggs,
and
other
Targaryens
had
sought
to
hatch
theirs
with
sorcery.
All
they
got
for
it
was
farce
and
tragedy.

“Samwell,”
said
a
glum
voice,
“I
was
coming
to
fetch
you.
I
was
told
to
bring
you
to
the
Lord
Commander.”

A
snowflake
landed
on
Sam’s
nose.
“Jon
wants
to
see
me?”

“As
to
that,
I
could
not
say,”
said
Dolorous
Edd
Tollett.
“I
never
wanted
to
see
half
the
things
I’ve
seen,
and
I’ve
never
seen
half
the
things
I
wanted
to.
I
don’t
think
wanting
comes
into
it.
You’d
best
go
all
the
same.
Lord
Snow
wishes
to
speak
with
you
as
soon
as
he
is
done
with
Craster’s
wife.”

“Gilly.”

“That’s
the
one.
If
my
wet
nurse
had
looked
like
her,
I’d
still
be
on
the
teat.
Mine
had
whiskers.”

“Most
goats
do,”
called
Pyp,
as
he
and
Grenn
emerged
from
around
the
corner,
with
longbows
in
hand
and
quivers
of
arrows
on
their
backs.
“Where
have
you
been,
Slayer?
We
missed
you
last
night
at
supper.
A
whole
roast
ox
went
uneaten.”

“Don’t
call
me
Slayer.”
Sam
ignored
the
gibe
about
the
ox.
That
was
just
Pyp.
“I
was
reading.
There
was
a
mouse...”

“Don’t
mention
mice
to
Grenn.
He’s
terrified
of
mice.”

“I
am
not,”
Grenn
declared
with
indignation.

“You’d
be
too
scared
to
eat
one.”

“I’d
eat
more
mice
than
you
would.”

Dolorous
Edd
Tollett
gave
a
sigh.
“When
I
was
a
lad,
we
only
ate
mice
on
special
feast
days.
I
was
the
youngest,
so
I
always
got
the
tail.
There’s
no
meat
on
the
tail.”

“Where’s
your
longbow,
Sam?”
asked
Grenn.
Ser
Alliser
used
to
call
him
Aurochs,
and
every
day
he
seemed
to
grow
into
the
name
a
little
more.
He
had
come
to
the
Wall
big
but
slow,
thick
of
neck,
thick
of
waist,
red
of
face,
and
clumsy.
Though
his
neck
still
reddened
when
Pyp
twisted
him
around
into
some
folly,
hours
of
work
with
sword
and
shield
had
flattened
his
belly,
hardened
his
arms,
broadened
his
chest.
He
was
strong,
and
shaggy
as
an
aurochs
too.
“Ulmer
was
expecting
you
at
the
butts.”

“Ulmer,”
Sam
said,
abashed.
Almost
the
first
thing
Jon
Snow
had
done
as
Lord
Commander
was
institute
daily
archery
drill
for
the
entire
garrison,
even
stewards
and
cooks.
The
Watch
had
been
placing
too
much
emphasis
on
the
sword
and
too
little
on
the
bow,
he
had
said,
a
relic
of
the
days
when
one
brother
in
every
ten
had
been
a
knight,
instead
of
one
in
every
hundred.
Sam
saw
the
sense
in
the
decree,
but
he
hated
longbow
practice
almost
as
much
as
he
hated
climbing
steps.
When
he
wore
his
gloves
he
could
never
hit
anything,
but
when
he
took
them
off
he
got
blisters
on
his
fingers.
Those
bows
were
dangerous.
Satin
had
torn
off
half
his
thumbnail
on
a
bowstring.
“I
forgot.”

“You
broke
the
heart
of
the
wildling
princess,
Slayer,”
said
Pyp.
Of
late,
Val
had
taken
to
watching
them
from
the
window
of
her
chamber
in
the
King’s
Tower.
“She
was
looking
for
you.”

“She
was
not!
Don’t
say
that!”
Sam
had
only
spoken
to
Val
twice,
when
Maester
Aemon
called
upon
her
to
make
sure
the
babes
were
healthy.
The
princess
was
so
pretty
that
he
oft
found
himself
stammering
and
blushing
in
her
presence.

“Why
not?”
asked
Pyp.
“She
wants
to
have
your
children.
Maybe
we
should
call
you
Sam
the
Seducer.”

Sam
reddened.
King
Stannis
had
plans
for
Val,
he
knew;
she
was
the
mortar
with
which
he
meant
to
seal
the
peace
between
the
northmen
and
the
free
folk.
“I
don’t
have
time
for
archery
today,
I
need
to
go
see
Jon.”

“Jon?
Jon?
Do
we
know
anyone
named
Jon,
Grenn?”

“He
means
the
Lord
Commander.”

“Ohhh.
The
Great
Lord
Snow.
To
be
sure.
Why
do
you
want
to
see
him?
He
can’t
even
wiggle
his
ears.”
Pyp
wiggled
his,
to
show
he
could.
They
were
large
ears,
and
red
from
cold.
“He’s
Lord
Snow
for
true
now,
too
bloody
highborn
for
the
likes
of
us.”

“Jon
has
duties,”
Sam
said
in
his
defense.
“The
Wall
is
his,
and
all
that
goes
with
it.”

“A
man
has
duties
to
his
friends
as
well.
If
not
for
us,
Janos
Slynt
might
be
our
lord
commander.
Lord
Janos
would
have
sent
Snow
ranging
naked
on
a
mule.
‘Scamper
on
up
to
Craster’s
Keep,’
he
would
have
said,
‘and
fetch
me
back
the
Old
Bear’s
cloak
and
boots.’
We
saved
him
from
that,
but
now
he
has
too
many
duties
to
drink
a
cup
of
mulled
wine
by
the
fire?”

Grenn
agreed.
“His
duties
don’t
keep
him
from
the
yard.
More
days
than
not,
he’s
out
there
fighting
someone.”

That
was
true,
Sam
had
to
admit.
Once,
when
Jon
came
to
consult
with
Maester
Aemon,
Sam
had
asked
him
why
he
spent
so
much
time
at
swordplay.
“The
Old
Bear
never
trained
much
when
he
was
Lord
Commander,”
he
had
pointed
out.
In
answer,
Jon
had
pressed
Longclaw
into
Sam’s
hand.
He
let
him
feel
the
lightness,
the
balance,
had
him
turn
the
blade
so
that
ripples
gleamed
in
the
smoke-dark
metal.
“Valyrian
steel,”
he
said,
“spell-forged
and
razor-sharp,
nigh
on
indestructible.
A
swordsman
should
be
as
good
as
his
sword,
Sam.
Longclaw
is
Valyrian
steel,
but
I’m
not.
The
Halfhand
could
have
killed
me
as
easy
as
you
swat
a
bug.”

Sam
handed
back
the
sword.
“When
I
try
to
swat
a
bug,
it
always
flies
away.
All
I
do
is
slap
my
arm.
It
stings.”

That
made
Jon
laugh.
“As
you
will.
Qhorin
could
have
killed
me
as
easy
as
you
eat
a
bowl
of
porridge.”
Sam
was
fond
of
porridge,
especially
when
it
was
sweetened
with
honey.

“I
don’t
have
time
for
this.”
Sam
left
his
friends
and
made
his
way
toward
the
armory,
clutching
his
books
to
his
chest.
I
am
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men,
he
remembered.
He
wondered
what
those
men
would
say
if
they
realized
their
realms
were
being
guarded
by
the
likes
of
Grenn,
Pyp,
and
Dolorous
Edd.

The
Lord
Commander’s
Tower
had
been
gutted
by
fire,
and
Stannis
Baratheon
had
claimed
the
King’s
Tower
for
his
own
residence,
so
Jon
Snow
had
established
himself
in
Donal
Noye’s
modest
quarters
behind
the
armory.
Gilly
was
leaving
as
Sam
arrived,
wrapped
up
in
the
old
cloak
he’d
given
her
when
they
were
fleeing
Craster’s
Keep.
She
almost
rushed
right
past
him,
but
Sam
caught
her
arm,
spilling
two
books
as
he
did.
“Gilly.”

“Sam.”
Her
voice
sounded
raw.
Gilly
was
dark-haired
and
slim,
with
the
big
brown
eyes
of
a
doe.
She
was
swallowed
by
the
folds
of
Sam’s
old
cloak,
her
face
half-hidden
by
its
hood,
but
shivering
all
the
same.
Her
face
looked
wan
and
frightened.

“What’s
wrong?”
Sam
asked
her.
“How
are
the
babes?”

Gilly
pulled
loose
from
him.
“They’re
good,
Sam.
Good.”

“Between
the
two
of
them
it’s
a
wonder
you
can
sleep,”
Sam
said
pleasantly.
“Which
one
was
it
that
I
heard
crying
last
night?
I
thought
he’d
never
stop.”

“Dalla’s
boy.
He
cries
when
he
wants
the
teat.
Mine...
mine
hardly
ever
cries.
Sometimes
he
gurgles,
but...”
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“I
have
to
go.
It’s
past
time
that
I
fed
them.
I’ll
be
leaking
all
over
myself
if
I
don’t
go.”
She
rushed
across
the
yard,
leaving
Sam
perplexed
behind
her.

He
had
to
get
down
on
his
knees
to
gather
up
the
books
he’d
dropped.
I
should
not
have
brought
so
many,
he
told
himself
as
he
brushed
the
dirt
off
Colloquo
Votar’s
Jade
Compendium,
a
thick
volume
of
tales
and
legends
from
the
east
that
Maester
Aemon
had
commanded
him
to
find.
The
book
appeared
undamaged.
Maester
Thomax’s
Dragonkin,
Being
a
History
of
House
Targaryen
from
Exile
to
Apotheosis,
with
a
Consideration
of
the
Life
and
Death
of
Dragons
had
not
been
so
fortunate.
It
had
come
open
as
it
fell,
and
a
few
pages
had
gotten
muddy,
including
one
with
a
rather
nice
picture
of
Balerion
the
Black
Dread
done
in
colored
inks.
Sam
cursed
himself
for
a
clumsy
oaf
as
he
smoothed
the
pages
down
and
brushed
them
off.
Gilly’s
presence
always
flustered
him
and
gave
rise
to...
well,
risings.
A
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
should
not
be
feeling
the
sorts
of
things
that
Gilly
made
him
feel,
especially
when
she
would
talk
about
her
breasts
and...

“Lord
Snow
is
waiting.”
Two
guards
in
black
cloaks
and
iron
halfhelms
stood
by
the
doors
of
the
armory,
leaning
on
their
spears.
Hairy
Hal
was
the
one
who’d
spoken.
Mully
helped
Sam
back
to
his
feet.
He
blurted
out
thanks
and
hurried
past
them,
clutching
desperately
at
the
stack
of
books
as
he
made
his
way
past
the
forge
with
its
anvil
and
bellows.
A
shirt
of
ringmail
rested
on
his
workbench,
half-completed.
Ghost
was
stretched
out
beneath
the
anvil,
gnawing
on
the
bone
of
an
ox
to
get
at
the
marrow.
The
big
white
direwolf
looked
up
when
Sam
went
by,
but
made
no
sound.

Jon’s
solar
was
back
beyond
the
racks
of
spears
and
shields.
He
was
reading
a
parchment
when
Sam
entered.
Lord
Commander
Mormont’s
raven
was
on
his
shoulder,
peering
down
as
if
it
were
reading
too,
but
when
the
bird
spied
Sam
it
spread
its
wings
and
flapped
toward
him
crying,
“Corn,
corn!”

Shifting
the
books,
Sam
thrust
his
arm
into
the
sack
beside
the
door
and
came
out
with
a
handful
of
kernels.
The
raven
landed
on
his
wrist
and
took
one
from
his
palm,
pecking
so
hard
that
Sam
yelped
and
snatched
his
hand
back.
The
raven
took
to
the
air
again,
and
yellow
and
red
kernels
went
everywhere.

“Close
the
door,
Sam.”
Faint
scars
still
marked
Jon’s
cheek,
where
an
eagle
had
once
tried
to
rip
his
eye
out.
“Did
that
wretch
break
the
skin?”

Sam
eased
the
books
down
and
peeled
off
his
glove.
“He
did.”
He
felt
faint.
“I’m
bleeding.”

“We
all
shed
our
blood
for
the
Watch.
Wear
thicker
gloves.”
Jon
shoved
a
chair
toward
him
with
a
foot.
“Sit,
and
have
a
look
at
this.”
He
handed
him
the
parchment.

“What
is
it?”
asked
Sam.
The
raven
began
to
hunt
out
corn
kernels
amongst
the
rushes.

“A
paper
shield.”

Sam
sucked
at
the
blood
on
his
palm
as
he
read.
He
knew
Maester
Aemon’s
hand
on
sight.
His
writing
was
small
and
precise,
but
the
old
man
could
not
see
where
the
ink
had
blotted,
and
sometimes
he
left
unsightly
smears.
“A
letter
to
King
Tommen?”

“At
Winterfell
Tommen
fought
my
brother
Bran
with
wooden
swords.
He
wore
so
much
padding
he
looked
like
a
stuffed
goose.
Bran
knocked
him
to
the
ground.”
Jon
went
to
the
window.
“Yet
Bran’s
dead,
and
pudgy
pink-faced
Tommen
is
sitting
on
the
Iron
Throne,
with
a
crown
nestled
amongst
his
golden
curls.”

Bran’s
not
dead,
Sam
wanted
to
say.
He’s
gone
beyond
the
Wall
with
Coldhands.
The
words
caught
in
his
throat.
I
swore
I
would
not
tell.
“You
haven’t
signed
the
letter.”

“The
Old
Bear
begged
the
Iron
Throne
for
help
a
hundred
times.
They
sent
him
Janos
Slynt.
No
letter
will
make
the
Lannisters
love
us
better.
Not
once
they
hear
that
we’ve
been
helping
Stannis.”

“Only
to
defend
the
Wall,
not
in
his
rebellion.”
Sam
read
the
letter
quickly
once
again.
“That’s
what
it
says
here.”

“The
distinction
may
escape
Lord
Tywin.”
Jon
took
the
letter
back.
“Why
would
he
help
us
now?
He
never
did
before.”

“Well,”
said
Sam,
“he
will
not
want
it
said
that
Stannis
rode
to
the
defense
of
the
realm
whilst
King
Tommen
was
playing
with
his
toys.
That
would
bring
scorn
down
upon
House
Lannister.”

“It’s
death
and
destruction
I
want
to
bring
down
upon
House
Lannister,
not
scorn.”
Jon
lifted
up
the
letter.
“The
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
part
in
the
wars
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
he
read.
“Our
oaths
are
sworn
to
the
realm,
and
the
realm
now
stands
in
dire
peril.
Stannis
Baratheon
aids
us
against
our
foes
from
beyond
the
Wall,
though
we
are
not
his
men...”

“Well,”
said
Sam,
squirming,
“we’re
not.
Are
we?”

“I
gave
Stannis
food,
shelter,
and
the
Nightfort,
plus
leave
to
settle
some
free
folk
in
the
Gift.
That’s
all.”

“Lord
Tywin
will
say
it
was
too
much.”

“Stannis
says
it’s
not
enough.
The
more
you
give
a
king
the
more
he
wants.
We
are
walking
on
a
bridge
of
ice
with
an
abyss
on
either
side.
Pleasing
one
king
is
difficult
enough.
Pleasing
two
is
hardly
possible.”

“Yes,
but...
if
the
Lannisters
should
prevail
and
Lord
Tywin
decides
that
we
betrayed
the
king
by
aiding
Stannis,
it
could
mean
the
end
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
He
has
the
Tyrells
behind
him,
with
all
the
strength
of
Highgarden.
And
he
did
defeat
Lord
Stannis
on
the
Blackwater.”
The
sight
of
blood
might
make
Sam
faint,
but
he
knew
how
wars
were
won.
His
own
father
had
seen
to
that.

“The
Blackwater
was
one
battle.
Robb
won
all
his
battles
and
still
lost
his
head.
If
Stannis
can
raise
the
north...”

He’s
trying
to
convince
himself,
Sam
realized,
but
he
can’t.
The
ravens
had
gone
forth
from
Castle
Black
in
a
storm
of
black
wings,
summoning
the
lords
of
the
north
to
declare
for
Stannis
Baratheon
and
join
their
strength
to
his.
Sam
had
sent
out
most
of
them
himself.
Thusfar
only
one
bird
had
returned,
the
one
they’d
sent
to
Karhold.
Elsewise
the
silence
had
been
thunderous.

Even
if
he
should
somehow
win
the
northmen
to
his
side,
Sam
did
not
see
how
Stannis
could
hope
to
match
the
combined
powers
of
Casterly
Rock,
Highgarden,
and
the
Twins.
Yet
without
the
north,
his
cause
was
surely
doomed.
As
doomed
as
the
Night’s
Watch,
if
Lord
Tywin
marks
us
down
as
traitors.
“The
Lannisters
have
northmen
of
their
own.
Lord
Bolton
and
his
bastard.”

“Stannis
has
the
Karstarks.
If
he
can
win
White
Harbor...”

“If,”
Sam
stressed.
“If
not...
my
lord,
even
a
paper
shield
is
better
than
none.”

Jon
rattled
the
letter.
“I
suppose
so.”
He
sighed,
then
took
up
a
quill
and
scrawled
a
signature
across
the
bottom
of
the
letter.
“Get
the
sealing
wax.”
Sam
heated
a
stick
of
black
wax
over
a
candle
and
dribbled
some
onto
the
parchment,
then
watched
as
Jon
pressed
the
Lord
Commander’s
seal
down
firmly
on
the
puddle.
“Take
this
to
Maester
Aemon
when
you
leave,”
he
commanded,
“and
tell
him
to
dispatch
a
bird
to
King’s
Landing.”

“I
will.”
Sam
hesitated.
“My
lord,
if
I
might
ask...
I
saw
Gilly
leaving.
She
was
almost
crying.”

“Val
sent
her
to
plead
for
Mance
again.”

“Oh.”
Val
was
the
sister
of
the
woman
the
King-beyond-the-Wall
had
taken
for
his
queen.
The
wildling
princess
was
what
Stannis
and
his
men
were
calling
her.
Her
sister
Dalla
had
died
during
the
battle,
though
no
blade
had
ever
touched
her;
she
had
perished
giving
birth
to
Mance
Rayder’s
son.
Rayder
himself
would
soon
follow
her
to
the
grave,
if
the
whispers
Sam
had
heard
had
any
truth
to
them.
“What
did
you
tell
her?”

“That
I
would
speak
to
Stannis,
though
I
doubt
my
words
will
sway
him.
A
king’s
first
duty
is
to
defend
the
realm,
and
Mance
attacked
it.
His
Grace
is
not
like
to
forget
that.
My
father
used
to
say
that
Stannis
Baratheon
was
a
just
man.
No
one
has
ever
said
he
was
forgiving.”
Jon
paused,
frowning.
“I
would
sooner
take
off
Mance’s
head
myself.
He
was
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
once.
By
rights,
his
life
belongs
to
us.”

“Pyp
says
that
Lady
Melisandre
means
to
give
him
to
the
flames,
to
work
some
sorcery.”

“Pyp
should
learn
to
hold
his
tongue.
I
have
heard
the
same
from
others.
King’s
blood,
to
wake
a
dragon.
Where
Melisandre
thinks
to
find
a
sleeping
dragon,
no
one
is
quite
sure.
It’s
nonsense.
Mance’s
blood
is
no
more
royal
than
mine
own.
He
has
never
worn
a
crown
nor
sat
a
throne.
He’s
a
brigand,
nothing
more.
There’s
no
power
in
brigand’s
blood.”

The
raven
looked
up
from
the
floor.
“Blood,”
it
screamed.

Jon
paid
no
mind.
“I
am
sending
Gilly
away.”

“Oh.”
Sam
bobbed
his
head.
“Well,
that’s...
that’s
good,
my
lord.”
It
would
be
the
best
thing
for
her,
to
go
somewhere
warm
and
safe,
well
away
from
the
Wall
and
the
fighting.

“Her
and
the
boy.
We
will
need
to
find
another
wet
nurse
for
his
milk
brother.”

“Goat’s
milk
might
serve,
until
you
do.
It’s
better
for
a
babe
than
cow’s
milk.”
Sam
had
read
that
somewhere.
He
shifted
in
his
seat.
“My
lord,
when
I
was
looking
through
the
annals
I
came
on
another
boy
commander.
Four
hundred
years
before
the
Conquest.
Osric
Stark
was
ten
when
he
was
chosen,
but
he
served
for
sixty
years.
That’s
four,
my
lord.
You’re
not
even
close
to
being
the
youngest
ever
chosen.
You’re
fifth
youngest,
so
far.”

“The
younger
four
all
being
sons,
brothers,
or
bastards
of
the
King
in
the
North.
Tell
me
something
useful.
Tell
me
of
our
enemy.”

“The
Others.”
Sam
licked
his
lips.
“They
are
mentioned
in
the
annals,
though
not
as
often
as
I
would
have
thought.
The
annals
I’ve
found
and
looked
at,
that
is.
There’s
more
I
haven’t
found,
I
know.
Some
of
the
older
books
are
falling
to
pieces.
The
pages
crumble
when
I
try
and
turn
them.
And
the
really
old
books...
either
they
have
crumbled
all
away
or
they
are
buried
somewhere
that
I
haven’t
looked
yet
or...
well,
it
could
be
that
there
are
no
such
books,
and
never
were.
The
oldest
histories
we
have
were
written
after
the
Andals
came
to
Westeros.
The
First
Men
only
left
us
runes
on
rocks,
so
everything
we
think
we
know
about
the
Age
of
Heroes
and
the
Dawn
Age
and
the
Long
Night
comes
from
accounts
set
down
by
septons
thousands
of
years
later.
There
are
archmaesters
at
the
Citadel
who
question
all
of
it.
Those
old
histories
are
full
of
kings
who
reigned
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
knights
riding
around
a
thousand
years
before
there
were
knights.
You
know
the
tales,
Brandon
the
Builder,
Symeon
Star-Eyes,
Night’s
King...
we
say
that
you’re
the
nine
hundred
and
ninety-eighth
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
but
the
oldest
list
I’ve
found
shows
six
hundred
seventy-four
commanders,
which
suggests
that
it
was
written
during...”

“Long
ago,”
Jon
broke
in.
“What
about
the
Others?”

“I
found
mention
of
dragonglass.
The
children
of
the
forest
used
to
give
the
Night’s
Watch
a
hundred
obsidian
daggers
every
year,
during
the
Age
of
Heroes.
The
Others
come
when
it
is
cold,
most
of
the
tales
agree.
Or
else
it
gets
cold
when
they
come.
Sometimes
they
appear
during
snowstorms
and
melt
away
when
the
skies
clear.
They
hide
from
the
light
of
the
sun
and
emerge
by
night...
or
else
night
falls
when
they
emerge.
Some
stories
speak
of
them
riding
the
corpses
of
dead
animals.
Bears,
direwolves,
mammoths,
horses,
it
makes
no
matter,
so
long
as
the
beast
is
dead.
The
one
that
killed
Small
Paul
was
riding
a
dead
horse,
so
that
part’s
plainly
true.
Some
accounts
speak
of
giant
ice
spiders
too.
I
don’t
know
what
those
are.
Men
who
fall
in
battle
against
the
Others
must
be
burned,
or
else
the
dead
will
rise
again
as
their
thralls.”

“We
knew
all
this.
The
question
is,
how
do
we
fight
them?”

“The
armor
of
the
Others
is
proof
against
most
ordinary
blades,
if
the
tales
can
be
believed,”
said
Sam,
“and
their
own
swords
are
so
cold
they
shatter
steel.
Fire
will
dismay
them,
though,
and
they
are
vulnerable
to
obsidian.”
He
remembered
the
one
he
had
faced
in
the
haunted
forest,
and
how
it
had
seemed
to
melt
away
when
he
stabbed
it
with
the
dragonglass
dagger
Jon
had
made
for
him.
“I
found
one
account
of
the
Long
Night
that
spoke
of
the
last
hero
slaying
Others
with
a
blade
of
dragonsteel.
Supposedly
they
could
not
stand
against
it.”

“Dragonsteel?”
Jon
frowned.
“Valyrian
steel?”

“That
was
my
first
thought
as
well.”

“So
if
I
can
just
convince
the
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
give
us
their
Valyrian
blades,
all
is
saved?
That
won’t
be
hard.”
His
laugh
had
no
mirth
in
it.
“Did
you
find
who
the
Others
are,
where
they
come
from,
what
they
want?”

“Not
yet,
my
lord,
but
it
may
be
that
I’ve
just
been
reading
the
wrong
books.
There
are
hundreds
I
have
not
looked
at
yet.
Give
me
more
time
and
I
will
find
whatever
there
is
to
be
found.”

“There
is
no
more
time.”
Jon
sounded
sad.
“You
need
to
get
your
things
together,
Sam.
You’re
going
with
Gilly.”

“Going?”
For
a
moment
Sam
did
not
understand.
“I’m
going?
To
Eastwatch,
my
lord?
Or...
where
am
I...”

“Oldtown.”

“Oldtown?”
It
came
out
in
a
squeak.
Horn
Hill
was
close
to
Oldtown.
Home.
The
notion
made
him
light-headed.
My
father.

“Aemon
as
well.”

“Aemon?
Maester
Aemon?
But...
he’s
one
hundred
and
two
years
old,
my
lord,
he
can’t...
you’re
sending
him
and
me?
Who
will
tend
the
ravens?
If
they’re
sick
or
wounded,
who...”

“Clydas.
He’s
been
with
Aemon
for
years.”

“Clydas
is
only
a
steward,
and
his
eyes
are
going
bad.
You
need
a
maester.
Maester
Aemon
is
so
frail,
a
sea
voyage...”
He
thought
of
the
Arbor
and
the
Arbor
Queen,
and
almost
choked
on
his
tongue.
“It
might...
he’s
old,
and...”

“His
life
will
be
at
risk.
I
am
aware
of
that,
Sam,
but
the
risk
is
greater
here.
Stannis
knows
who
Aemon
is.
If
the
red
woman
requires
king’s
blood
for
her
spells...”

“Oh.”
Sam
paled.

“Dareon
will
join
you
at
Eastwatch.
My
hope
is
that
his
songs
will
win
some
men
for
us
in
the
south.
The
Blackbird
will
deliver
you
to
Braavos.
From
there
you’ll
arrange
your
own
passage
to
Oldtown.
If
you
still
mean
to
claim
Gilly’s
babe
as
your
bastard,
send
her
and
the
child
on
to
Horn
Hill.
Elsewise,
Aemon
will
find
a
servant’s
place
for
her
at
the
Citadel.”

“My
b-b-bastard.”
He
had
said
that,
yes,
but...
All
that
water.
I
could
drown.
Ships
sink
all
the
time,
and
autumn
is
a
stormy
season.
Gilly
would
be
with
him,
though,
and
the
babe
would
grow
up
safe.
“Yes,
I...
my
mother
and
my
sisters
will
help
Gilly
with
the
child.”
I
can
send
a
letter,
I
won’t
need
to
go
to
Horn
Hill
myself.
“Dareon
could
see
her
to
Oldtown
just
as
well
as
me.
I’m...
I’ve
been
working
at
my
archery
every
afternoon
with
Ulmer,
as
you
commanded...
well,
except
when
I’m
in
the
vaults,
but
you
told
me
to
find
out
about
the
Others.
The
longbow
makes
my
shoulders
ache
and
raises
blisters
on
my
fingers.”
He
showed
Jon
where
one
had
burst.
“I
still
do
it,
though.
I
can
hit
the
target
more
often
than
not
now,
but
I’m
still
the
worst
archer
who
ever
bent
a
bow.
I
like
Ulmer’s
stories,
though.
Someone
needs
to
write
them
down
and
put
them
in
a
book.”

“You
do
it.
They
have
parchment
and
ink
at
the
Citadel,
as
well
as
longbows.
I
will
expect
you
to
continue
with
your
practice.
Sam,
the
Night’s
Watch
has
hundreds
of
men
who
can
loose
an
arrow,
but
only
a
handful
who
can
read
or
write.
I
need
you
to
become
my
new
maester.”

The
word
made
him
flinch.
No,
Father,
please,
I
won’t
speak
of
it
again,
I
swear
it
by
the
Seven.
Let
me
out,
please
let
me
out.
“My
lord,
I...
my
work
is
here,
the
books...”

“...will
be
here
when
you
return
to
us.”

Sam
put
a
hand
to
his
throat.
He
could
almost
feel
the
chain
there,
choking
him.
“My
lord,
the
Citadel...
they
make
you
cut
up
corpses
there.”
They
make
you
wear
a
chain
about
your
neck.
If
it
is
chains
you
want,
come
with
me.
For
three
days
and
three
nights
Sam
had
sobbed
himself
to
sleep,
manacled
hand
and
foot
to
a
wall.
The
chain
around
his
throat
was
so
tight
it
broke
the
skin,
and
whenever
he
rolled
the
wrong
way
in
his
sleep
it
would
cut
off
his
breath.
“I
cannot
wear
a
chain.”

“You
can.
You
will.
Maester
Aemon
is
old
and
blind.
His
strength
is
leaving
him.
Who
will
take
his
place
when
he
dies?
Maester
Mullin
at
the
Shadow
Tower
is
more
fighter
than
scholar,
and
Maester
Harmune
of
Eastwatch
is
drunk
more
than
he’s
sober.”

“If
you
ask
the
Citadel
for
more
maesters...”

“I
mean
to.
We’ll
have
need
of
every
one.
Aemon
Targaryen
is
not
so
easily
replaced,
however.”
Jon
seemed
puzzled.
“I
was
certain
this
would
please
you.
There
are
so
many
books
at
the
Citadel
that
no
man
can
hope
to
read
them
all.
You
would
do
well
there,
Sam.
I
know
you
would.”

“No.
I
could
read
the
books,
but...
a
m-maester
must
be
a
healer
and
b-b-blood
makes
me
faint.”
He
held
out
a
shaky
hand
for
Jon
to
see.
“I’m
Sam
the
Scared,
not
Sam
the
Slayer.”

“Scared?
Of
what?
The
chidings
of
old
men?
Sam,
you
saw
the
wights
come
swarming
up
the
Fist,
a
tide
of
living
dead
men
with
black
hands
and
bright
blue
eyes.
You
slew
an
Other.”

“It
was
the
d-d-d-dragonglass,
not
me.”

“Be
quiet.
You
lied
and
schemed
and
plotted
to
make
me
Lord
Commander.
You
will
obey
me.
You’ll
go
to
the
Citadel
and
forge
a
chain,
and
if
you
have
to
cut
up
corpses,
so
be
it.
At
least
in
Oldtown
the
corpses
won’t
object.”

He
doesn’t
understand.
“My
lord,”
Sam
said,
“my
f-f-f-father,
Lord
Randyll,
he,
he,
he,
he,
he...
the
life
of
a
maester
is
a
life
of
servitude.”
He
was
babbling,
he
knew.
“No
son
of
House
Tarly
will
ever
wear
a
chain.
The
men
of
Horn
Hill
do
not
bow
and
scrape
to
petty
lords.”
If
it
is
chains
you
want,
come
with
me.
“Jon,
I
cannot
disobey
my
father.”

Jon,
he’d
said,
but
Jon
was
gone.
It
was
Lord
Snow
who
faced
him
now,
grey
eyes
as
hard
as
ice.
“You
have
no
father,”
said
Lord
Snow.
“Only
brothers.
Only
us.
Your
life
belongs
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
so
go
and
stuff
your
smallclothes
into
a
sack,
along
with
anything
else
you
care
to
take
to
Oldtown.
You
leave
an
hour
before
sunrise.
And
here’s
another
order.
From
this
day
forth,
you
will
not
call
yourself
a
craven.
You’ve
faced
more
things
this
past
year
than
most
men
face
in
a
lifetime.
You
can
face
the
Citadel,
but
you’ll
face
it
as
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
I
can’t
command
you
to
be
brave,
but
I
can
command
you
to
hide
your
fears.
You
said
the
words,
Sam.
Remember?”

I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
But
he
was
wretched
with
a
sword,
and
the
darkness
scared
him.
“I...
I’ll
try.”

“You
won’t
try.
You
will
obey.”

“Obey.”
Mormont’s
raven
flapped
its
great
black
wings.

“As
my
lord
commands.
Does...
does
Maester
Aemon
know?”

“It
was
as
much
his
idea
as
mine.”
Jon
opened
the
door
for
him.
“No
farewells.
The
fewer
folk
who
know
of
this,
the
better.
An
hour
before
first
light,
by
the
lichyard.”

Sam
did
not
recall
leaving
the
armory.
The
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
stumbling
through
mud
and
patches
of
old
snow,
toward
Maester
Aemon’s
chambers.
I
could
hide,
he
told
himself.
I
could
hide
in
the
vaults
amongst
the
books.
I
could
live
down
there
with
the
mouse
and
sneak
up
at
night
to
steal
food.
Crazed
thoughts,
he
knew,
as
futile
as
they
were
desperate.
The
vaults
were
the
first
place
they
would
look
for
him.
The
last
place
they
would
look
for
him
was
beyond
the
Wall,
but
that
was
even
madder.
The
wildlings
would
catch
me
and
kill
me
slowly.
They
might
burn
me
alive,
the
way
the
red
woman
means
to
burn
Mance
Rayder.

When
he
found
Maester
Aemon
in
the
rookery,
he
gave
him
Jon’s
letter
and
blurted
out
his
fears
in
a
great
green
gush
of
words.
“He
does
not
understand.”
Sam
felt
as
if
he
might
throw
up.
“If
I
don
a
chain,
my
lord
f-f-f-father...
he,
he,
he...”

“My
own
father
raised
the
same
objections
when
I
chose
a
life
of
service,”
the
old
man
said.
“It
was
his
father
who
sent
me
to
the
Citadel.
King
Daeron
had
sired
four
sons,
and
three
had
sons
of
their
own.
Too
many
dragons
are
as
dangerous
as
too
few,
I
heard
His
Grace
tell
my
lord
father,
the
day
they
sent
me
off.”
Aemon
raised
a
spotted
hand
to
the
chain
of
many
metals
that
dangled
loose
about
his
thin
neck.
“The
chain
is
heavy,
Sam,
but
my
grandsire
had
the
right
of
it.
So
does
your
Lord
Snow.”

“Snow,”
a
raven
muttered.
“Snow,”
another
echoed.
All
of
them
picked
it
up
then.
“Snow,
snow,
snow,
snow,
snow.”
Sam
had
taught
them
that
word.
There
was
no
help
here,
he
saw.
Maester
Aemon
was
as
trapped
as
he
was.
He
will
die
at
sea,
he
thought,
despairing.
He
is
too
old
to
survive
such
a
voyage.
Gilly’s
little
son
may
die
as
well,
he’s
not
as
large
and
strong
as
Dalla’s
boy.
Does
Jon
mean
to
kill
us
all?

The
next
morning,
Sam
found
himself
saddling
the
mare
he’d
ridden
from
Horn
Hill
and
leading
her
toward
the
lichyard
beside
the
eastern
road.
Her
saddlebags
bulged
with
cheese
and
sausages
and
hard-cooked
eggs,
and
half
a
salted
ham
that
Three-Finger
Hobb
had
given
him
on
his
name
day.
“You’re
a
man
who
appreciates
cooking,
Slayer,”
the
cook
had
said.
“We
need
more
o’
your
sort.”
The
ham
would
help,
no
doubt.
Eastwatch
was
a
long
cold
ride
away,
and
there
were
no
towns
nor
inns
in
the
shadow
of
the
Wall.

The
hour
before
dawn
was
dark
and
still.
Castle
Black
seemed
strangely
hushed.
At
the
lichyard,
a
pair
of
two-wheeled
wayns
awaited
him,
along
with
Black
Jack
Bulwer
and
a
dozen
seasoned
rangers,
tough
as
the
garrons
they
rode.
Kedge
Whiteye
cursed
loudly
when
his
one
good
eye
spied
Sam.
“Don’t
mind
him,
Slayer,”
said
Black
Jack.
“He
lost
a
wager,
said
we’d
need
to
drag
you
out
squealing
from
beneath
some
bed.”

Maester
Aemon
was
too
frail
to
ride
a
horse,
so
a
wayn
had
been
made
ready
for
him,
its
bed
heaped
high
with
furs,
and
a
leather
awning
fastened
overhead
to
keep
off
the
rain
and
snow.
Gilly
and
her
child
would
ride
with
him.
The
second
wayn
would
carry
their
clothing
and
possessions,
along
with
a
chest
of
rare
old
books
that
Aemon
thought
the
Citadel
might
lack.
Sam
had
spent
half
the
night
searching
for
them,
though
he’d
found
only
one
in
four.
And
a
good
thing,
or
we’d
need
another
wayn.

When
the
maester
appeared,
he
was
bundled
up
in
a
bearskin
three
times
his
size.
As
Clydas
led
him
toward
the
wayn,
a
gust
of
wind
came
up,
and
the
old
man
staggered.
Sam
hurried
to
his
side
and
put
an
arm
about
him.
Another
gust
like
that
could
blow
him
over
the
Wall.
“Keep
hold
of
my
arm,
maester.
It’s
not
far.”

The
blind
man
nodded
as
the
wind
pushed
back
their
hoods.
“It
is
always
warm
in
Oldtown.
There
is
an
inn
on
an
island
in
the
Honeywine
where
I
used
to
go
when
I
was
a
young
novice.
It
will
be
pleasant
to
sit
there
once
again,
sipping
cider.”

By
the
time
they
got
the
maester
into
the
wayn,
Gilly
had
appeared,
the
child
bundled
in
her
arms.
Beneath
her
hood
her
eyes
were
red
from
crying.
Jon
turned
up
at
the
same
time,
with
Dolorous
Edd.
“Lord
Snow,”
Maester
Aemon
called,
“I
left
a
book
for
you
in
my
chambers.
The
Jade
Compendium.
It
was
written
by
the
Volantene
adventurer
Colloquo
Votar,
who
traveled
to
the
east
and
visited
all
the
lands
of
the
Jade
Sea.
There
is
a
passage
you
may
find
of
interest.
I’ve
told
Clydas
to
mark
it
for
you.”

“I’ll
be
sure
to
read
it,”
Jon
Snow
replied.

A
line
of
pale
snot
ran
from
Maester
Aemon’s
nose.
He
wiped
it
away
with
the
back
of
his
glove.
“Knowledge
is
a
weapon,
Jon.
Arm
yourself
well
before
you
ride
forth
to
battle.”

“I
will.”
A
light
snow
had
begun
to
fall,
the
big
soft
flakes
drifting
down
lazily
from
the
sky.
Jon
turned
to
Black
Jack
Bulwer.
“Make
as
good
a
time
as
you
can,
but
take
no
foolish
risks.
You
have
an
old
man
and
a
suckling
babe
with
you.
See
that
you
keep
them
warm
and
well
fed.”

“You
do
the
same,
m’lord,”
said
Gilly.
“You
do
the
same
for
t’other.
Find
another
wet
nurse,
like
you
said.
You
promised
me
you
would.
The
boy...
Dalla’s
boy...
the
little
prince,
I
mean...
you
find
him
some
good
woman,
so
he
grows
up
big
and
strong.”

“You
have
my
word,”
Jon
Snow
said
solemnly.

“Don’t
you
name
him.
Don’t
you
do
that
till
he’s
past
two
years.
It’s
ill
luck
to
name
them
when
they’re
still
on
the
breast.
You
crows
may
not
know
that,
but
it’s
true.”

“As
you
command,
my
lady.”

A
spasm
of
anger
flashed
across
Gilly’s
face.
“Don’t
you
call
me
that.
I’m
a
mother,
not
a
lady.
I’m
Craster’s
wife
and
Craster’s
daughter,
and
a
mother.”

Dolorous
Edd
took
the
babe
as
Gilly
climbed
into
the
wayn
and
covered
her
legs
with
some
musty
pelts.
By
then
the
eastern
sky
was
more
grey
than
black.
Left
Hand
Lew
was
anxious
to
be
off.
Edd
handed
the
infant
up
and
Gilly
put
him
to
her
breast.
This
may
be
the
last
I
ever
see
of
Castle
Black,
thought
Sam
as
he
hoisted
himself
atop
his
mare.
As
much
as
he
had
once
hated
Castle
Black,
it
was
tearing
him
apart
to
leave
it.

“Let’s
do
this,”
Bulwer
commanded.
A
whip
snapped,
and
the
wayns
began
to
rumble
slowly
down
the
rutted
road
as
the
snow
came
down
around
them.
Sam
lingered
beside
Clydas
and
Dolorous
Edd
and
Jon
Snow.
“Well,”
he
said,
“farewell.”

“And
to
you,
Sam,”
said
Dolorous
Edd.
“Your
boat’s
not
like
to
sink,
I
don’t
think.
Boats
only
sink
when
I’m
aboard.”

Jon
was
watching
the
wayns.
“The
first
time
I
saw
Gilly,”
he
said,
“she
was
pressed
back
against
the
wall
of
Craster’s
Keep,
this
skinny
dark-haired
girl
with
her
big
belly,
cringing
away
from
Ghost.
He
had
gotten
in
among
her
rabbits,
and
I
think
she
was
frightened
that
he
would
tear
her
open
and
devour
the
babe...
but
it
was
not
the
wolf
she
should
have
been
afraid
of,
was
it?”

No,
Sam
thought.
Craster
was
the
danger,
her
own
father.

“She
has
more
courage
than
she
knows.”

“So
do
you,
Sam.
Have
a
swift,
safe
voyage,
and
take
care
of
her
and
Aemon
and
the
child.”
Jon
smiled
a
strange,
sad
smile.
“And
pull
your
hood
up.
The
snowflakes
are
melting
in
your
hair.”





ARYA

Faint
and
far
away
the
light
burned,
low
on
the
horizon,
shining
through
the
sea
mists.

“It
looks
like
a
star,”
said
Arya.

“The
star
of
home,”
said
Denyo.

His
father
was
shouting
orders.
Sailors
scrambled
up
and
down
the
three
tall
masts
and
moved
along
the
rigging,
reefing
the
heavy
purple
sails.
Below,
oarsmen
heaved
and
strained
over
two
great
banks
of
oars.
The
decks
tilted,
creaking,
as
the
galleas
Titan’s
Daughter
heeled
to
starboard
and
began
to
come
about.

The
star
of
home.
Arya
stood
at
the
prow,
one
hand
resting
on
the
gilded
figurehead,
a
maiden
with
a
bowl
of
fruit.
For
half
a
heartbeat
she
let
herself
pretend
that
it
was
her
home
ahead.

But
that
was
stupid.
Her
home
was
gone,
her
parents
dead,
and
all
her
brothers
slain
but
Jon
Snow
on
the
Wall.
That
was
where
she
had
wanted
to
go.
She
told
the
captain
as
much,
but
even
the
iron
coin
did
not
sway
him.
Arya
never
seemed
to
find
the
places
she
set
out
to
reach.
Yoren
had
sworn
to
deliver
her
to
Winterfell,
only
she
had
ended
up
in
Harrenhal
and
Yoren
in
his
grave.
When
she
escaped
Harrenhal
for
Riverrun,
Lem
and
Anguy
and
Tom
o’
Sevens
took
her
captive
and
dragged
her
to
the
hollow
hill
instead.
Then
the
Hound
had
stolen
her
and
dragged
her
to
the
Twins.
Arya
had
left
him
dying
by
the
river
and
gone
ahead
to
Saltpans,
hoping
to
take
passage
for
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,
only...

Braavos
might
not
be
so
bad.
Syrio
was
from
Braavos,
and
Jaqen
might
be
there
as
well.
It
was
Jaqen
who
had
given
her
the
iron
coin.
He
hadn’t
truly
been
her
friend,
the
way
that
Syrio
had,
but
what
good
had
friends
ever
done
her?
I
don’t
need
any
friends,
so
long
as
I
have
Needle.
She
brushed
the
ball
of
her
thumb
across
the
sword’s
smooth
pommel,
wishing,
wishing...

If
truth
be
told,
Arya
did
not
know
what
to
wish
for,
any
more
than
she
knew
what
awaited
her
beneath
that
distant
light.
The
captain
had
given
her
passage
but
he
had
no
time
to
speak
with
her.
Some
of
the
crew
shunned
her,
but
others
gave
her
gifts—a
silver
fork,
fingerless
gloves,
a
floppy
woolen
hat
patched
with
leather.
One
man
showed
her
how
to
tie
sailor’s
knots.
Another
poured
her
thimble
cups
of
fire
wine.
The
friendly
ones
would
tap
their
chests,
repeating
their
names
over
and
over
until
Arya
said
them
back,
though
none
ever
thought
to
ask
her
name.
They
called
her
Salty,
since
she’d
come
aboard
at
Saltpans,
near
the
mouth
of
the
Trident.
It
was
as
good
a
name
as
any,
she
supposed.

The
last
of
the
night’s
stars
had
vanished...
all
but
the
pair
dead
ahead.
“It’s
two
stars
now.”

“Two
eyes,”
said
Denyo.
“The
Titan
sees
us.”

The
Titan
of
Braavos.
Old
Nan
had
told
them
stories
of
the
Titan
back
in
Winterfell.
He
was
a
giant
as
tall
as
a
mountain,
and
whenever
Braavos
stood
in
danger
he
would
wake
with
fire
in
his
eyes,
his
rocky
limbs
grinding
and
groaning
as
he
waded
out
into
the
sea
to
smash
the
enemies.
“The
Braavosi
feed
him
on
the
juicy
pink
flesh
of
little
highborn
girls,”
Nan
would
end,
and
Sansa
would
give
a
stupid
squeak.
But
Maester
Luwin
said
the
Titan
was
only
a
statue,
and
Old
Nan’s
stories
were
only
stories.

Winterfell
is
burned
and
fallen,
Arya
reminded
herself.
Old
Nan
and
Maester
Luwin
were
both
dead,
most
like,
and
Sansa
too.
It
did
no
good
to
think
of
them.
All
men
must
die.
That
was
what
the
words
meant,
the
words
that
Jaqen
H’ghar
had
taught
her
when
he
gave
her
the
worn
iron
coin.
She
had
learned
more
Braavosi
words
since
they
left
Saltpans,
the
words
for
please
and
thank
you
and
sea
and
star
and
fire
wine,
but
she
came
to
them
knowing
that
all
men
must
die.
Most
of
the
Daughter’s
crew
had
a
smattering
of
the
Common
Tongue
from
nights
ashore
in
Oldtown
and
King’s
Landing
and
Maidenpool,
though
only
the
captain
and
his
sons
spoke
it
well
enough
to
talk
to
her.
Denyo
was
the
youngest
of
those
sons,
a
plump,
cheerful
boy
of
twelve
who
kept
his
father’s
cabin
and
helped
his
eldest
brother
do
his
sums.

“I
hope
your
Titan
isn’t
hungry,”
Arya
told
him.

“Hungry?”
Denyo
said,
confused.

“It
takes
no
matter.”
Even
if
the
Titan
did
eat
juicy
pink
girl
flesh,
Arya
would
not
fear
him.
She
was
a
scrawny
thing,
no
proper
meal
for
a
giant,
and
almost
eleven,
practically
a
woman
grown.
And
Salty
isn’t
highborn,
either.
“Is
the
Titan
the
god
of
Braavos?”
she
asked.
“Or
do
you
have
the
Seven?”

“All
gods
are
honored
in
Braavos.”
The
captain’s
son
loved
to
talk
about
his
city
almost
as
much
as
he
loved
to
talk
about
his
father’s
ship.
“Your
Seven
have
a
sept
here,
the
Sept-Beyond-the-Sea,
but
only
Westerosi
sailors
worship
there.”

They
are
not
my
Seven.
They
were
my
mother’s
gods,
and
they
let
the
Freys
murder
her
at
the
Twins.
She
wondered
whether
she
would
find
a
godswood
in
Braavos,
with
a
weirwood
at
its
heart.
Denyo
might
know,
but
she
could
not
ask
him.
Salty
was
from
Saltpans,
and
what
would
a
girl
from
Saltpans
know
about
the
old
gods
of
the
north?
The
old
gods
are
dead,
she
told
herself,
with
Mother
and
Father
and
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
all
dead.
A
long
time
ago,
she
remembered
her
father
saying
that
when
the
cold
winds
blow
the
lone
wolf
dies
and
the
pack
survives.
He
had
it
all
backwards.
Arya,
the
lone
wolf,
still
lived,
but
the
wolves
of
the
pack
had
been
taken
and
slain
and
skinned.

“The
Moonsingers
led
us
to
this
place
of
refuge,
where
the
dragons
of
Valyria
could
not
find
us,”
Denyo
said.
“Theirs
is
the
greatest
temple.
We
esteem
the
Father
of
Waters
as
well,
but
his
house
is
built
anew
whenever
he
takes
his
bride.
The
rest
of
the
gods
dwell
together
on
an
isle
in
the
center
of
the
city.
That
is
where
you
will
find
the...
the
Many-Faced
God.”

The
Titan’s
eyes
seemed
brighter
now,
and
farther
apart.
Arya
did
not
know
any
Many-Faced
God,
but
if
he
answered
prayers,
he
might
be
the
god
she
sought.
Ser
Gregor,
she
thought,
Dunsen,
Raff
the
Sweetling,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.
Only
six
now.
Joffrey
was
dead,
the
Hound
had
slain
Polliver,
and
she’d
stabbed
the
Tickler
herself,
and
that
stupid
squire
with
the
pimple.
I
wouldn’t
have
killed
him
if
he
hadn’t
grabbed
me.
The
Hound
had
been
dying
when
she
left
him
on
the
banks
of
the
Trident,
burning
up
with
fever
from
his
wound.
I
should
have
given
him
the
gift
of
mercy
and
put
a
knife
into
his
heart.

“Salty,
look!”
Denyo
took
her
by
the
arm
and
turned
her.
“Can
you
see?
There.”
He
pointed.

The
mists
gave
way
before
them,
ragged
grey
curtains
parted
by
their
prow.
The
Titan’s
Daughter
cleaved
through
the
grey-green
waters
on
billowing
purple
wings.
Arya
could
hear
the
cries
of
seabirds
overhead.
There,
where
Denyo
pointed,
a
line
of
stony
ridges
rose
sudden
from
the
sea,
their
steep
slopes
covered
with
soldier
pines
and
black
spruce.
But
dead
ahead
the
sea
had
broken
through,
and
there
above
the
open
water
the
Titan
towered,
with
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
long
green
hair
blowing
in
the
wind.

His
legs
bestrode
the
gap,
one
foot
planted
on
each
mountain,
his
shoulders
looming
tall
above
the
jagged
crests.
His
legs
were
carved
of
solid
stone,
the
same
black
granite
as
the
sea
monts
on
which
he
stood,
though
around
his
hips
he
wore
an
armored
skirt
of
greenish
bronze.
His
breastplate
was
bronze
as
well,
and
his
head
in
his
crested
halfhelm.
His
blowing
hair
was
made
of
hempen
ropes
dyed
green,
and
huge
fires
burned
in
the
caves
that
were
his
eyes.
One
hand
rested
atop
the
ridge
to
his
left,
bronze
fingers
coiled
about
a
knob
of
stone;
the
other
thrust
up
into
the
air,
clasping
the
hilt
of
a
broken
sword.

He
is
only
a
little
bigger
than
King
Baelor’s
statue
in
King’s
Landing,
she
told
herself
when
they
were
still
well
off
to
sea.
As
the
galleas
drove
closer
to
where
the
breakers
smashed
against
the
ridgeline,
however,
the
Titan
grew
larger
still.
She
could
hear
Denyo’s
father
bellowing
commands
in
his
deep
voice,
and
up
in
the
rigging
men
were
bringing
in
the
sails.
We
are
going
to
row
beneath
the
Titan’s
legs.
Arya
could
see
the
arrow
slits
in
the
great
bronze
breastplate,
and
stains
and
speckles
on
the
Titan’s
arms
and
shoulders
where
the
seabirds
nested.
Her
neck
craned
upward.
Baelor
the
Blessed
would
not
reach
his
knee.
He
could
step
right
over
the
walls
of
Winterfell.

Then
the
Titan
gave
a
mighty
roar.

The
sound
was
as
huge
as
he
was,
a
terrible
groaning
and
grinding,
so
loud
it
drowned
out
even
the
captain’s
voice
and
the
crash
of
the
waves
against
those
pine-clad
ridges.
A
thousand
seabirds
took
to
the
air
at
once,
and
Arya
flinched
until
she
saw
that
Denyo
was
laughing.
“He
warns
the
Arsenal
of
our
coming,
that
is
all,”
he
shouted.
“You
must
not
be
afraid.”

“I
never
was,”
Arya
shouted
back.
“It
was
loud,
is
all.”

Wind
and
wave
had
the
Titan’s
Daughter
hard
in
hand
now,
driving
her
swiftly
toward
the
channel.
Her
double
bank
of
oars
stroked
smoothly,
lashing
the
sea
to
white
foam
as
the
Titan’s
shadow
fell
upon
them.
For
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
they
must
surely
smash
up
against
the
stones
beneath
his
legs.
Huddled
by
Denyo
at
the
prow,
Arya
could
taste
salt
where
the
spray
had
touched
her
face.
She
had
to
look
straight
up
to
see
the
Titan’s
head.
“The
Braavosi
feed
him
on
the
juicy
pink
flesh
of
little
highborn
girls,”
she
heard
Old
Nan
say
again,
but
she
was
not
a
little
girl,
and
she
would
not
be
frightened
of
a
stupid
statue.

Even
so,
she
kept
one
hand
on
Needle
as
they
slipped
between
his
legs.
More
arrow
slits
dotted
the
insides
of
those
great
stone
thighs,
and
when
Arya
craned
her
neck
around
to
watch
the
crow’s
nest
slip
through
with
a
good
ten
yards
to
spare,
she
spied
murder
holes
beneath
the
Titan’s
armored
skirts,
and
pale
faces
staring
down
at
them
from
behind
the
iron
bars.

And
then
they
were
past.

The
shadow
lifted,
the
pine-clad
ridges
fell
away
to
either
side,
the
winds
dwindled,
and
they
found
themselves
moving
through
a
great
lagoon.
Ahead
rose
another
sea
mont,
a
knob
of
rock
that
pushed
up
from
the
water
like
a
spiked
fist,
its
stony
battlements
bristling
with
scorpions,
spitfires,
and
trebuchets.
“The
Arsenal
of
Braavos,”
Denyo
named
it,
as
proud
as
if
he’d
built
it.
“They
can
build
a
war
galley
there
in
a
day.”
Arya
could
see
dozens
of
galleys
tied
up
at
quays
and
perched
on
launching
slips.
The
painted
prows
of
others
poked
from
innumerable
wooden
sheds
along
the
stony
shores,
like
hounds
in
a
kennel,
lean
and
mean
and
hungry,
waiting
for
a
hunter’s
horn
to
call
them
forth.
She
tried
to
count
them,
but
there
were
too
many,
and
more
docks
and
sheds
and
quays
where
the
shoreline
curved
away.

Two
galleys
had
come
out
to
meet
them.
They
seemed
to
skim
upon
the
water
like
dragonflies,
their
pale
oars
flashing.
Arya
heard
the
captain
shouting
to
them
and
their
own
captains
shouting
back,
but
she
did
not
understand
the
words.
A
great
horn
sounded.
The
galleys
passed
to
either
side
of
them,
so
close
that
she
could
hear
the
muffled
sound
of
drums
from
within
their
purple
hulls,
bom
bom
bom
bom
bom
bom
bom
bom,
like
the
beat
of
living
hearts.

Then
the
galleys
were
behind
them,
and
the
Arsenal
as
well.
Ahead
stretched
a
broad
expanse
of
pea-green
water
rippled
like
a
sheet
of
colored
glass.
From
its
wet
heart
arose
the
city
proper,
a
great
sprawl
of
domes
and
towers
and
bridges,
grey
and
gold
and
red.
The
hundred
isles
of
Braavos
in
the
sea.

Maester
Luwin
had
taught
them
about
Braavos,
but
Arya
had
forgotten
much
of
what
he’d
said.
It
was
a
flat
city,
she
could
see
that
even
from
afar,
not
like
King’s
Landing
on
its
three
high
hills.
The
only
hills
here
were
the
ones
that
men
had
raised
of
brick
and
granite,
bronze
and
marble.
Something
else
was
missing
as
well,
though
it
took
her
a
few
moments
to
realize
what
it
was.
The
city
has
no
walls.
But
when
she
said
as
much
to
Denyo,
he
laughed
at
her.
“Our
walls
are
made
of
wood
and
painted
purple,”
he
told
her.
“Our
galleys
are
our
walls.
We
need
no
other.”

The
deck
creaked
behind
them.
Arya
turned
to
find
Denyo’s
father
looming
over
them
in
his
long
captain’s
coat
of
purple
wool.
Tradesman-Captain
Ternesio
Terys
wore
no
whiskers
and
kept
his
grey
hair
cut
short
and
neat,
framing
his
square,
windburnt
face.
On
the
crossing
she
had
oft
seen
him
jesting
with
his
crew,
but
when
he
frowned
men
ran
from
him
as
if
before
a
storm.
He
was
frowning
now.
“Our
voyage
is
at
an
end,”
he
told
Arya.
“We
make
for
the
Chequy
Port,
where
the
Sealord’s
customs
officers
will
come
aboard
to
inspect
our
holds.
They
will
be
half
a
day
at
it,
they
always
are,
but
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
wait
upon
their
pleasure.
Gather
your
belongings.
I
shall
lower
a
boat,
and
Yorko
will
put
you
ashore.”

Ashore.
Arya
bit
her
lip.
She
had
crossed
the
narrow
sea
to
get
here,
but
if
the
captain
had
asked
she
would
have
told
him
she
wanted
to
stay
aboard
the
Titan’s
Daughter.
Salty
was
too
small
to
man
an
oar,
she
knew
that
now,
but
she
could
learn
to
splice
ropes
and
reef
the
sails
and
steer
a
course
across
the
great
salt
seas.
Denyo
had
taken
her
up
to
the
crow’s
nest
once,
and
she
hadn’t
been
afraid
at
all,
though
the
deck
had
seemed
a
tiny
thing
below
her.
I
can
do
sums
too,
and
keep
a
cabin
neat.

But
the
galleas
had
no
need
of
a
second
boy.
Besides,
she
had
only
to
look
at
the
captain’s
face
to
know
how
anxious
he
was
to
be
rid
of
her.
So
Arya
only
nodded.
“Ashore,”
she
said,
though
ashore
meant
only
strangers.

“Valar
dohaeris.”
He
touched
two
fingers
to
his
brow.
“I
beg
you
remember
Ternesio
Terys
and
the
service
he
has
done
you.”

“I
will,”
Arya
said
in
a
small
voice.
The
wind
tugged
at
her
cloak,
insistent
as
a
ghost.
It
was
time
she
was
away.

Gather
your
belongings,
the
captain
had
said,
but
there
were
few
enough
of
those.
Only
the
clothes
she
was
wearing,
her
little
pouch
of
coins,
the
gifts
the
crew
had
given
her,
the
dagger
on
her
left
hip
and
Needle
on
her
right.

The
boat
was
ready
before
she
was,
and
Yorko
was
at
the
oars.
He
was
the
captain’s
son
as
well,
but
older
than
Denyo
and
less
friendly.
I
never
said
farewell
to
Denyo,
she
thought
as
she
clambered
down
to
join
him.
She
wondered
if
she
would
ever
see
the
boy
again.
I
should
have
said
farewell.

The
Titan’s
Daughter
dwindled
in
their
wake,
while
the
city
grew
larger
with
every
stroke
of
Yorko’s
oars.
A
harbor
was
visible
off
to
her
right,
a
tangle
of
piers
and
quays
crowded
with
big-bellied
whalers
out
of
Ibben,
swan
ships
from
the
Summer
Isles,
and
more
galleys
than
a
girl
could
count.
Another
harbor,
more
distant,
was
off
to
her
left,
beyond
a
sinking
point
of
land
where
the
tops
of
half-drowned
buildings
thrust
themselves
above
the
water.
Arya
had
never
seen
so
many
big
buildings
all
together
in
one
place.
King’s
Landing
had
the
Red
Keep
and
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
and
the
Dragonpit,
but
Braavos
seemed
to
boast
a
score
of
temples
and
towers
and
palaces
that
were
as
large
or
even
larger.
I
will
be
a
mouse
again,
she
thought
glumly,
the
way
I
was
in
Harrenhal
before
I
ran
away.

The
city
had
seemed
like
one
big
island
from
where
the
Titan
stood,
but
as
Yorko
rowed
them
closer
she
saw
that
it
was
many
small
islands
close
together,
linked
by
arched
stone
bridges
that
spanned
innumerable
canals.
Beyond
the
harbor
she
glimpsed
streets
of
grey
stone
houses,
built
so
close
they
leaned
one
upon
the
other.
To
Arya’s
eyes
they
were
queer-looking,
four
and
five
stories
tall
and
very
skinny,
with
sharp-peaked
tile
roofs
like
pointed
hats.
She
saw
no
thatch,
and
only
a
few
timbered
houses
of
the
sort
she
knew
in
Westeros.
They
have
no
trees,
she
realized.
Braavos
is
all
stone,
a
grey
city
in
a
green
sea.

Yorko
swung
them
north
of
the
docks
and
down
the
gullet
of
a
great
canal,
a
broad
green
waterway
that
ran
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
city.
They
passed
under
the
arches
of
a
carved
stone
bridge,
decorated
with
half
a
hundred
kinds
of
fish
and
crabs
and
squids.
A
second
bridge
appeared
ahead,
this
one
carved
in
lacy
leafy
vines,
and
beyond
that
a
third,
gazing
down
on
them
from
a
thousand
painted
eyes.
The
mouths
of
lesser
canals
opened
to
either
side,
and
others
still
smaller
off
of
those.
Some
of
the
houses
were
built
above
the
waterways,
she
saw,
turning
the
canals
into
a
sort
of
tunnel.
Slender
boats
slid
in
and
out
among
them,
wrought
in
the
shapes
of
water
serpents
with
painted
heads
and
upraised
tails.
Those
were
not
rowed
but
poled,
she
saw,
by
men
who
stood
at
their
sterns
in
cloaks
of
grey
and
brown
and
deep
moss
green.
She
saw
huge
flat-bottomed
barges
too,
heaped
high
with
crates
and
barrels
and
pushed
along
by
twenty
polemen
to
a
side,
and
fancy
floating
houses
with
lanterns
of
colored
glass,
velvet
drapes,
and
brazen
figureheads.
Off
in
the
far
distance,
looming
above
canals
and
houses
both,
was
a
massive
grey
stone
roadway
of
some
kind,
supported
by
three
tiers
of
mighty
arches
marching
away
south
into
the
haze.
“What’s
that?”
Arya
asked
Yorko,
pointing.
“The
sweetwater
river,”
he
told
her.
“It
brings
fresh
water
from
the
mainland,
across
the
mudflats
and
the
briny
shallows.
Good
sweet
water
for
the
fountains.”

When
she
looked
behind
her,
the
harbor
and
lagoon
were
lost
to
sight.
Ahead,
a
row
of
mighty
statues
stood
along
both
sides
of
the
channel,
solemn
stone
men
in
long
bronze
robes,
spattered
with
the
droppings
of
the
seabirds.
Some
held
books,
some
daggers,
some
hammers.
One
clutched
a
golden
star
in
his
upraised
hand.
Another
was
upending
a
stone
flagon
to
send
an
endless
stream
of
water
splashing
down
into
the
canal.
“Are
they
gods?”
asked
Arya.

“Sealords,”
said
Yorko.
“The
Isle
of
the
Gods
is
farther
on.
See?
Six
bridges
down,
on
the
right
bank.
That
is
the
Temple
of
the
Moonsingers.”

It
was
one
of
those
that
Arya
had
spied
from
the
lagoon,
a
mighty
mass
of
snow-white
marble
topped
by
a
huge
silvered
dome
whose
milk
glass
windows
showed
all
the
phases
of
the
moon.
A
pair
of
marble
maidens
flanked
its
gates,
tall
as
the
Sealords,
supporting
a
crescent-shaped
lintel.

Beyond
it
stood
another
temple,
a
red
stone
edifice
as
stern
as
any
fortress.
Atop
its
great
square
tower
a
fire
blazed
in
an
iron
brazier
twenty
feet
across,
whilst
smaller
fires
flanked
its
brazen
doors.
“The
red
priests
love
their
fires,”
Yorko
told
her.
“The
Lord
of
Light
is
their
god,
red
R’hllor.”

I
know.
Arya
remembered
Thoros
of
Myr
in
his
bits
of
old
armor,
worn
over
robes
so
faded
that
he
had
seemed
more
a
pink
priest
than
a
red
one.
Yet
his
kiss
had
brought
Lord
Beric
back
from
death.
She
watched
the
red
god’s
house
drift
by,
wondering
whether
these
Braavosi
priests
of
his
could
do
the
same.

Next
came
a
huge
brick
structure
festooned
with
lichen.
Arya
might
have
taken
it
for
a
storehouse
had
not
Yorko
said,
“That
is
the
Holy
Refuge,
where
we
honor
the
small
gods
the
world
has
forgotten.
You
will
hear
it
called
the
Warren
too.”
A
small
canal
ran
between
the
Warren’s
looming
lichen-covered
walls,
and
there
he
swung
them
right.
They
passed
through
a
tunnel
and
out
again
into
the
light.
More
shrines
loomed
up
to
either
side.

“I
never
knew
there
were
so
many
gods,”
Arya
said.

Yorko
grunted.
They
went
around
a
bend
and
beneath
another
bridge.
On
their
left
appeared
a
rocky
knoll
with
a
windowless
temple
of
dark
grey
stone
at
its
top.
A
flight
of
stone
steps
led
from
its
doors
down
to
a
covered
dock.

Yorko
backed
the
oars,
and
the
boat
bumped
gently
against
stone
pilings.
He
grasped
an
iron
ring
set
to
hold
them
for
a
moment.
“Here
I
leave
you.”

The
dock
was
shadowed,
the
steps
steep.
The
temple’s
black
tile
roof
came
to
a
sharp
peak,
like
the
houses
along
the
canals.
Arya
chewed
her
lip.
Syrio
came
from
Braavos.
He
might
have
visited
this
temple.
He
might
have
climbed
those
steps.
She
grabbed
a
ring
and
pulled
herself
up
onto
the
dock.

“You
know
my
name,”
said
Yorko
from
the
boat.

“Yorko
Terys.”

“Valar
dohaeris.”
He
pushed
off
with
his
oar
and
drifted
back
off
into
the
deeper
water.
Arya
watched
him
row
back
the
way
they’d
come,
until
he
vanished
in
the
shadows
of
the
bridge.
As
the
swish
of
oars
faded,
she
could
almost
hear
the
beating
of
her
heart.
Suddenly
she
was
somewhere
else...
back
in
Harrenhal
with
Gendry,
maybe,
or
with
the
Hound
in
the
woods
along
the
Trident.
Salty
is
a
stupid
child,
she
told
herself.
I
am
a
wolf,
and
will
not
be
afraid.
She
patted
Needle’s
hilt
for
luck
and
plunged
into
the
shadows,
taking
the
steps
two
at
a
time
so
no
one
could
ever
say
she’d
been
afraid.

At
the
top
she
found
a
set
of
carved
wooden
doors
twelve
feet
high.
The
left-hand
door
was
made
of
weirwood
pale
as
bone,
the
right
of
gleaming
ebony.
In
their
center
was
a
carved
moon
face;
ebony
on
the
weirwood
side,
weirwood
on
the
ebony.
The
look
of
it
reminded
her
somehow
of
the
heart
tree
in
the
godswood
at
Winterfell.
The
doors
are
watching
me,
she
thought.
She
pushed
upon
both
doors
at
once
with
the
flat
of
her
gloved
hands,
but
neither
one
would
budge.
Locked
and
barred.
“Let
me
in,
you
stupid,”
she
said.
“I
crossed
the
narrow
sea.”
She
made
a
fist
and
pounded.
“Jaqen
told
me
to
come.
I
have
the
iron
coin.”
She
pulled
it
from
her
pouch
and
held
it
up.
“See?
Valar
morghulis.”

The
doors
made
no
reply,
except
to
open.

They
opened
inward
all
in
silence,
with
no
human
hand
to
move
them.
Arya
took
a
step
forward,
and
another.
The
doors
closed
behind
her,
and
for
a
moment
she
was
blind.
Needle
was
in
her
hand,
though
she
did
not
remember
drawing
it.

A
few
candles
burned
along
the
walls,
but
gave
so
little
light
that
Arya
could
not
see
her
own
feet.
Someone
was
whispering,
too
softly
for
her
to
make
out
words.
Someone
else
was
weeping.
She
heard
light
footfalls,
leather
sliding
over
stone,
a
door
opening
and
closing.
Water,
I
hear
water
too.

Slowly
her
eyes
adjusted.
The
temple
seemed
much
larger
within
than
it
had
without.
The
septs
of
Westeros
were
seven-sided,
with
seven
altars
for
the
seven
gods,
but
here
there
were
more
gods
than
seven.
Statues
of
them
stood
along
the
walls,
massive
and
threatening.
Around
their
feet
red
candles
flickered,
as
dim
as
distant
stars.
The
nearest
was
a
marble
woman
twelve
feet
tall.
Real
tears
were
trickling
from
her
eyes,
to
fill
the
bowl
she
cradled
in
her
arms.
Beyond
her
was
a
man
with
a
lion’s
head
seated
on
a
throne,
carved
of
ebony.
On
the
other
side
of
the
doors,
a
huge
horse
of
bronze
and
iron
reared
up
on
two
great
legs.
Farther
on
she
could
make
out
a
great
stone
face,
a
pale
infant
with
a
sword,
a
shaggy
black
goat
the
size
of
an
aurochs,
a
hooded
man
leaning
on
a
staff.
The
rest
were
only
looming
shapes
to
her,
half-seen
through
the
gloom.
Between
the
gods
were
hidden
alcoves
thick
with
shadows,
with
here
and
there
a
candle
burning.

Silent
as
a
shadow,
Arya
moved
between
rows
of
long
stone
benches,
her
sword
in
hand.
The
floor
was
made
of
stone,
her
feet
told
her;
not
polished
marble
like
the
floor
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
but
something
rougher.
She
passed
some
women
whispering
together.
The
air
was
warm
and
heavy,
so
heavy
that
she
yawned.
She
could
smell
the
candles.
The
scent
was
unfamiliar,
and
she
put
it
down
to
some
queer
incense,
but
as
she
got
deeper
into
the
temple,
they
seemed
to
smell
of
snow
and
pine
needles
and
hot
stew.
Good
smells,
Arya
told
herself,
and
felt
a
little
braver.
Brave
enough
to
slip
Needle
back
into
its
sheath.

In
the
center
of
the
temple
she
found
the
water
she
had
heard;
a
pool
ten
feet
across,
black
as
ink
and
lit
by
dim
red
candles.
Beside
it
sat
a
young
man
in
a
silvery
cloak,
weeping
softly.
She
watched
him
dip
a
hand
in
the
water,
sending
scarlet
ripples
racing
across
the
pool.
When
he
drew
his
fingers
back
he
sucked
them,
one
by
one.
He
must
be
thirsty.
There
were
stone
cups
along
the
rim
of
the
pool.
Arya
filled
one
and
brought
it
to
him,
so
he
could
drink.
The
young
man
stared
at
her
for
a
long
moment
when
she
offered
it
to
him.
“Valar
morghulis,”
he
said.

“Valar
dohaeris,”
she
replied.

He
drank
deep,
and
dropped
the
cup
into
the
pool
with
a
soft
plop.
Then
he
pushed
himself
to
his
feet,
swaying,
holding
his
belly.
For
a
moment
Arya
thought
he
was
going
to
fall.
It
was
only
then
that
she
saw
the
dark
stain
below
his
belt,
spreading
as
she
watched.
“You’re
stabbed,”
she
blurted,
but
the
man
paid
her
no
mind.
He
lurched
unsteadily
toward
the
wall
and
crawled
into
an
alcove
onto
a
hard
stone
bed.
When
Arya
peered
around,
she
saw
other
alcoves
too.
On
some
there
were
old
people
sleeping.

No,
a
half-remembered
voice
seemed
to
whisper
in
her
head.
They
are
dead,
or
dying.
Look
with
your
eyes.

A
hand
touched
her
arm.

Arya
spun
away,
but
it
was
only
a
little
girl:
a
pale
little
girl
in
a
cowled
robe
that
seemed
to
engulf
her,
black
on
the
right
side
and
white
on
the
left.
Beneath
the
cowl
was
a
gaunt
and
bony
face,
hollow
cheeks,
and
dark
eyes
that
looked
as
big
as
saucers.
“Don’t
grab
me,”
Arya
warned
the
waif.
“I
killed
the
boy
who
grabbed
me
last.”

The
girl
said
some
words
that
Arya
did
not
know.

She
shook
her
head.
“Don’t
you
know
the
Common
Tongue?”

A
voice
behind
her
said,
“I
do.”

Arya
did
not
like
the
way
they
kept
surprising
her.
The
hooded
man
was
tall,
enveloped
in
a
larger
version
of
the
black-and-white
robe
the
girl
was
wearing.
Beneath
his
cowl
all
she
could
see
was
the
faint
red
glitter
of
candlelight
reflecting
off
his
eyes.
“What
place
is
this?”
she
asked
him.

“A
place
of
peace.”
His
voice
was
gentle.
“You
are
safe
here.
This
is
the
House
of
Black
and
White,
my
child.
Though
you
are
young
to
seek
the
favor
of
the
Many-Faced
God.”

“Is
he
like
the
southron
god,
the
one
with
seven
faces?”

“Seven?
No.
He
has
faces
beyond
count,
little
one,
as
many
faces
as
there
are
stars
in
the
sky.
In
Braavos,
men
worship
as
they
will...
but
at
the
end
of
every
road
stands
Him
of
Many
Faces,
waiting.
He
will
be
there
for
you
one
day,
do
not
fear.
You
need
not
rush
to
his
embrace.”

“I
only
came
to
find
Jaqen
H’ghar.”

“I
do
not
know
this
name.”

Her
heart
sank.
“He
was
from
Lorath.
His
hair
was
white
on
one
side
and
red
on
the
other.
He
said
he’d
teach
me
secrets,
and
gave
me
this.”
The
iron
coin
was
clutched
in
her
fist.
When
she
opened
her
fingers,
it
clung
to
her
sweaty
palm.

The
priest
studied
the
coin,
though
he
made
no
move
to
touch
it.
The
waif
with
the
big
eyes
was
looking
at
it
too.
Finally,
the
cowled
man
said,
“Tell
me
your
name,
child.”

“Salty.
I
come
from
Saltpans,
by
the
Trident.”

Though
she
could
not
see
his
face,
somehow
she
could
feel
him
smiling.
“No,”
he
said.
“Tell
me
your
name.”

“Squab,”
she
answered
this
time.

“Your
true
name,
child.”

“My
mother
named
me
Nan,
but
they
call
me
Weasel—”

“Your
name.”

She
swallowed.
“Arry.
I’m
Arry.”

“Closer.
And
now
the
truth?”

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
told
herself.
“Arya.”
She
whispered
the
word
the
first
time.
The
second
time
she
threw
it
at
him.
“I
am
Arya,
of
House
Stark.”

“You
are,”
he
said,
“but
the
House
of
Black
and
White
is
no
place
for
Arya,
of
House
Stark.”

“Please,”
she
said.
“I
have
no
place
to
go.”

“Do
you
fear
death?”

She
bit
her
lip.
“No.”

“Let
us
see.”
The
priest
lowered
his
cowl.
Beneath
he
had
no
face;
only
a
yellowed
skull
with
a
few
scraps
of
skin
still
clinging
to
the
cheeks,
and
a
white
worm
wriggling
from
one
empty
eye
socket.
“Kiss
me,
child,”
he
croaked,
in
a
voice
as
dry
and
husky
as
a
death
rattle.

Does
he
think
to
scare
me?
Arya
kissed
him
where
his
nose
should
be
and
plucked
the
grave
worm
from
his
eye
to
eat
it,
but
it
melted
like
a
shadow
in
her
hand.

The
yellow
skull
was
melting
too,
and
the
kindliest
old
man
that
she
had
ever
seen
was
smiling
down
at
her.
“No
one
has
ever
tried
to
eat
my
worm
before,”
he
said.
“Are
you
hungry,
child?”

Yes,
she
thought,
but
not
for
food.





CERSEI

A
cold
rain
was
falling,
turning
the
walls
and
ramparts
of
the
Red
Keep
dark
as
blood.
The
queen
held
the
king’s
hand
and
led
him
firmly
across
the
muddy
yard
to
where
her
litter
waited
with
its
escort.
“Uncle
Jaime
said
I
could
ride
my
horse
and
throw
pennies
to
the
smallfolk,”
the
boy
objected.

“Do
you
want
to
catch
a
chill?”
She
would
not
risk
it;
Tommen
had
never
been
as
robust
as
Joffrey.
“Your
grandfather
would
want
you
to
look
a
proper
king
at
his
wake.
We
will
not
appear
at
the
Great
Sept
wet
and
bedraggled.”
Bad
enough
I
must
wear
mourning
again.
Black
had
never
been
a
happy
color
on
her.
With
her
fair
skin,
it
made
her
look
half
a
corpse
herself.
Cersei
had
risen
an
hour
before
dawn
to
bathe
and
fix
her
hair,
and
she
did
not
intend
to
let
the
rain
destroy
her
efforts.

Inside
the
litter,
Tommen
settled
back
against
his
pillows
and
peered
out
at
the
falling
rain.
“The
gods
are
weeping
for
grandfather.
Lady
Jocelyn
says
the
raindrops
are
their
tears.”

“Jocelyn
Swyft
is
a
fool.
If
the
gods
could
weep,
they
would
have
wept
for
your
brother.
Rain
is
rain.
Close
the
curtain
before
you
let
any
more
in.
That
mantle
is
sable,
would
you
have
it
soaked?”

Tommen
did
as
he
was
bid.
His
meekness
troubled
her.
A
king
had
to
be
strong.
Joffrey
would
have
argued.
He
was
never
easy
to
cow.
“Don’t
slump
so,”
she
told
Tommen.
“Sit
like
a
king.
Put
your
shoulders
back
and
straighten
your
crown.
Do
you
want
it
to
tumble
off
your
head
in
front
of
all
your
lords?”

“No,
Mother.”
The
boy
sat
straight
and
reached
up
to
fix
the
crown.
Joff’s
crown
was
too
big
for
him.
Tommen
had
always
inclined
to
plumpness,
but
his
face
seemed
thinner
now.
Is
he
eating
well?
She
must
remember
to
ask
the
steward.
She
could
not
risk
Tommen
growing
ill,
not
with
Myrcella
in
the
hands
of
the
Dornishmen.
He
will
grow
into
Joff’s
crown
in
time.
Until
he
did,
a
smaller
one
might
be
needed,
one
that
did
not
threaten
to
swallow
his
head.
She
would
take
it
up
with
the
goldsmiths.

The
litter
made
its
slow
way
down
Aegon’s
High
Hill.
Two
Kingsguard
rode
before
them,
white
knights
on
white
horses
with
white
cloaks
hanging
sodden
from
their
shoulders.
Behind
came
fifty
Lannister
guardsmen
in
gold
and
crimson.

Tommen
peered
through
the
drapes
at
the
empty
streets.
“I
thought
there
would
be
more
people.
When
Father
died,
all
the
people
came
out
to
watch
us
go
by.”

“This
rain
has
driven
them
inside.”
King’s
Landing
had
never
loved
Lord
Tywin.
He
never
wanted
love,
though.
“You
cannot
eat
love,
nor
buy
a
horse
with
it,
nor
warm
your
halls
on
a
cold
night,”
she
heard
him
tell
Jaime
once,
when
her
brother
had
been
no
older
than
Tommen.

At
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
that
magnificence
in
marble
atop
Visenya’s
Hill,
the
little
knot
of
mourners
were
outnumbered
by
the
gold
cloaks
that
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
had
drawn
up
across
the
plaza.
More
will
turn
out
later,
the
queen
told
herself
as
Ser
Meryn
Trant
helped
her
from
the
litter.
Only
the
highborn
and
their
retinues
were
to
be
admitted
to
the
morning
service;
there
would
be
another
in
the
afternoon
for
the
commons,
and
the
evening
prayers
were
open
to
all.
Cersei
would
need
to
return
for
that,
so
that
the
smallfolk
might
see
her
mourn.
The
mob
must
have
its
show.
It
was
a
nuisance.
She
had
offices
to
fill,
a
war
to
win,
a
realm
to
rule.
Her
father
would
have
understood
that.

The
High
Septon
met
them
at
the
top
of
the
steps.
A
bent
old
man
with
a
wispy
grey
beard,
he
was
so
stooped
by
the
weight
of
his
ornate
embroidered
robes
that
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
queen’s
breasts...
though
his
crown,
an
airy
confection
of
cut
crystal
and
spun
gold,
added
a
good
foot
and
a
half
to
his
height.

Lord
Tywin
had
given
him
that
crown
to
replace
the
one
that
was
lost
when
the
mob
killed
the
previous
High
Septon.
They
had
pulled
the
fat
fool
from
his
litter
and
torn
him
apart,
the
day
Myrcella
sailed
for
Dorne.
That
one
was
a
great
glutton,
and
biddable.
This
one...
This
High
Septon
was
of
Tyrion’s
making,
Cersei
recalled
suddenly.
It
was
a
disquieting
thought.

The
old
man’s
spotted
hand
looked
like
a
chicken
claw
as
it
poked
from
a
sleeve
encrusted
with
golden
scrollwork
and
small
crystals.
Cersei
knelt
on
the
wet
marble
and
kissed
his
fingers,
and
bid
Tommen
to
do
the
same.
What
does
he
know
of
me?
How
much
did
the
dwarf
tell
him?
The
High
Septon
smiled
as
he
escorted
her
into
the
sept.
But
was
it
a
threatening
smile
full
of
unspoken
knowledge,
or
just
some
vacuous
twitch
of
an
old
man’s
wrinkled
lips?
The
queen
could
not
be
certain.

They
made
their
way
through
the
Hall
of
Lamps
beneath
colored
globes
of
leaded
glass,
Tommen’s
hand
in
hers.
Trant
and
Kettleblack
flanked
them,
water
dripping
from
their
wet
cloaks
to
puddle
on
the
floor.
The
High
Septon
walked
slowly,
leaning
on
a
weirwood
staff
topped
by
a
crystal
orb.
Seven
of
the
Most
Devout
attended
him,
shimmering
in
cloth-of-silver.
Tommen
wore
cloth-of-gold
beneath
his
sable
mantle,
the
queen
an
old
gown
of
black
velvet
lined
with
ermine.
There’d
been
no
time
to
have
a
new
one
made,
and
she
could
not
wear
the
same
dress
she
had
worn
for
Joffrey,
nor
the
one
she’d
buried
Robert
in.

At
least
I
will
not
be
expected
to
don
mourning
for
Tyrion.
I
shall
dress
in
crimson
silk
and
cloth-of-gold
for
that,
and
wear
rubies
in
my
hair.
The
man
who
brought
her
the
dwarf’s
head
would
be
raised
to
lordship,
she
had
proclaimed,
no
matter
how
mean
and
low
his
birth
or
station.
Ravens
were
carrying
her
promise
to
every
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
soon
enough
word
would
cross
the
narrow
sea
to
the
Nine
Free
Cities
and
the
lands
beyond.
Let
the
Imp
run
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,
he
will
not
escape
me.

The
royal
procession
passed
through
the
inner
doors
into
the
cavernous
heart
of
the
Great
Sept,
and
down
a
wide
aisle,
one
of
seven
that
met
beneath
the
dome.
To
right
and
left,
highborn
mourners
sank
to
their
knees
as
the
king
and
queen
went
by.
Many
of
her
father’s
bannermen
were
here,
and
knights
who
had
fought
beside
Lord
Tywin
in
half
a
hundred
battles.
The
sight
of
them
made
her
feel
more
confident.
I
am
not
without
friends.

Under
the
Great
Sept’s
lofty
dome
of
glass
and
gold
and
crystal,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister’s
body
rested
upon
a
stepped
marble
bier.
At
its
head
Jaime
stood
at
vigil,
his
one
good
hand
curled
about
the
hilt
of
a
tall
golden
greatsword
whose
point
rested
on
the
floor.
The
hooded
cloak
he
wore
was
as
white
as
freshly
fallen
snow,
and
the
scales
of
his
long
hauberk
were
mother-of-pearl
chased
with
gold.
Lord
Tywin
would
have
wanted
him
in
Lannister
gold
and
crimson,
she
thought.
It
always
angered
him
to
see
Jaime
all
in
white.
Her
brother
was
growing
his
beard
again
as
well.
The
stubble
covered
his
jaw
and
cheeks,
and
gave
his
face
a
rough,
uncouth
look.
He
might
at
least
have
waited
till
Father’s
bones
were
interred
beneath
the
Rock.

Cersei
led
the
king
up
three
short
steps,
to
kneel
beside
the
body.
Tommen’s
eyes
were
filled
with
tears.
“Weep
quietly,”
she
told
him,
leaning
close.
“You
are
a
king,
not
a
squalling
child.
Your
lords
are
watching
you.”
The
boy
swiped
the
tears
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
He
had
her
eyes,
emerald
green,
as
large
and
bright
as
Jaime’s
eyes
had
been
when
he
was
Tommen’s
age.
Her
brother
had
been
such
a
pretty
boy...
but
fierce
as
well,
as
fierce
as
Joffrey,
a
true
lion
cub.
The
queen
put
her
arm
around
Tommen
and
kissed
his
golden
curls.
He
will
need
me
to
teach
him
how
to
rule
and
keep
him
safe
from
his
enemies.
Some
of
them
stood
around
them
even
now,
pretending
to
be
friends.

The
silent
sisters
had
armored
Lord
Tywin
as
if
to
fight
some
final
battle.
He
wore
his
finest
plate,
heavy
steel
enameled
a
deep,
dark
crimson,
with
gold
inlay
on
his
gauntlets,
greaves,
and
breastplate.
His
rondels
were
golden
sunbursts;
a
golden
lioness
crouched
upon
each
shoulder;
a
maned
lion
crested
the
greathelm
beside
his
head.
Upon
his
chest
lay
a
longsword
in
a
gilded
scabbard
studded
with
rubies,
his
hands
folded
about
its
hilt
in
gloves
of
gilded
mail.
Even
in
death
his
face
is
noble,
she
thought,
although
the
mouth...
The
corners
of
her
father’s
lips
curved
upward
ever
so
slightly,
giving
him
a
look
of
vague
bemusement.
That
should
not
be.
She
blamed
Pycelle;
he
should
have
told
the
silent
sisters
that
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
never
smiled.
The
man
is
as
useless
as
nipples
on
a
breastplate.
That
half
smile
made
Lord
Tywin
seem
less
fearful,
somehow.
That,
and
the
fact
that
his
eyes
were
closed.
Her
father’s
eyes
had
always
been
unsettling;
pale
green,
almost
luminous,
flecked
with
gold.
His
eyes
could
see
inside
you,
could
see
how
weak
and
worthless
and
ugly
you
were
down
deep.
When
he
looked
at
you,
you
knew.

Unbidden,
a
memory
came
to
her,
of
the
feast
King
Aerys
had
thrown
when
Cersei
first
came
to
court,
a
girl
as
green
as
summer
grass.
Old
Merryweather
had
been
nattering
about
raising
the
duty
on
wine
when
Lord
Rykker
said,
“If
we
need
gold,
His
Grace
should
sit
Lord
Tywin
on
his
chamber
pot.”
Aerys
and
his
lickspittles
laughed
loudly,
whilst
Father
stared
at
Rykker
over
his
wine
cup.
Long
after
the
merriment
had
died
that
gaze
had
lingered.
Rykker
turned
away,
turned
back,
met
Father’s
eyes,
then
ignored
them,
drank
a
tankard
of
ale,
and
stalked
off
red-faced,
defeated
by
a
pair
of
unflinching
eyes.

Lord
Tywin’s
eyes
are
closed
forever
now,
Cersei
thought.
It
is
my
look
they
will
flinch
from
now,
my
frown
that
they
must
fear.
I
am
a
lion
too.

It
was
gloomy
within
the
sept
with
the
sky
so
grey
outside.
If
the
rain
ever
stopped,
the
sun
would
slant
down
through
the
hanging
crystals
to
drape
the
corpse
in
rainbows.
The
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
deserved
rainbows.
He
had
been
a
great
man.
I
shall
be
greater,
though.
A
thousand
years
from
now,
when
the
maesters
write
about
this
time,
you
shall
be
remembered
only
as
Queen
Cersei’s
sire.

“Mother.”
Tommen
tugged
her
sleeve.
“What
smells
so
bad?”

My
lord
father.
“Death.”
She
could
smell
it
too;
a
faint
whisper
of
decay
that
made
her
want
to
wrinkle
her
nose.
Cersei
paid
it
no
mind.
The
seven
septons
in
the
silver
robes
stood
behind
the
bier,
beseeching
the
Father
Above
to
judge
Lord
Tywin
justly.
When
they
were
done,
seventy-seven
septas
gathered
before
the
altar
of
the
Mother
and
began
to
sing
to
her
for
mercy.
Tommen
was
fidgeting
by
then,
and
even
the
queen’s
knees
had
begun
to
ache.
She
glanced
at
Jaime.
Her
twin
stood
as
if
he
had
been
carved
from
stone,
and
would
not
meet
her
eyes.

On
the
benches,
their
uncle
Kevan
knelt
with
his
shoulders
slumped,
his
son
beside
him.
Lancel
looks
worse
than
Father.
Though
only
seventeen,
he
might
have
passed
for
seventy;
grey-faced,
gaunt,
with
hollow
cheeks,
sunken
eyes,
and
hair
as
white
and
brittle
as
chalk.
How
can
Lancel
be
among
the
living
when
Tywin
Lannister
is
dead?
Have
the
gods
taken
leave
of
their
wits?

Lord
Gyles
was
coughing
more
than
usual
and
covering
his
nose
with
a
square
of
red
silk.
He
can
smell
it
too.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
his
eyes
closed.
If
he
has
fallen
asleep,
I
swear
I
will
have
him
whipped.
To
the
right
of
the
bier
knelt
the
Tyrells:
the
Lord
of
Highgarden,
his
hideous
mother
and
vapid
wife,
his
son
Garlan
and
his
daughter
Margaery.
Queen
Margaery,
she
reminded
herself;
Joff’s
widow
and
Tommen’s
wife-to-be.
Margaery
looked
very
like
her
brother,
the
Knight
of
Flowers.
The
queen
wondered
if
they
had
other
things
in
common.
Our
little
rose
has
a
good
many
ladies
waiting
attendance
on
her,
night
and
day.
They
were
with
her
now,
almost
a
dozen
of
them.
Cersei
studied
their
faces,
wondering.
Who
is
the
most
fearful,
the
most
wanton,
the
hungriest
for
favor?
Who
has
the
loosest
tongue?
She
would
need
to
make
a
point
of
finding
out.

It
was
a
relief
when
the
singing
finally
ended.
The
smell
coming
off
her
father’s
corpse
seemed
to
have
grown
stronger.
Most
of
the
mourners
had
the
decency
to
pretend
that
nothing
was
amiss,
but
Cersei
saw
two
of
Lady
Margaery’s
cousins
wrinkling
their
little
Tyrell
noses.
As
she
and
Tommen
were
walking
back
down
the
aisle
the
queen
thought
she
heard
someone
mutter
“privy”
and
chortle,
but
when
she
turned
her
head
to
see
who
had
spoken
a
sea
of
solemn
faces
gazed
at
her
blankly.
They
would
never
have
dared
make
japes
about
him
when
he
was
still
alive.
He
would
have
turned
their
bowels
to
water
with
a
look.

Back
out
in
the
Hall
of
Lamps,
the
mourners
buzzed
about
them
thick
as
flies,
eager
to
shower
her
with
useless
condolences.
The
Redwyne
twins
both
kissed
her
hand,
their
father
her
cheeks.
Hallyne
the
Pyromancer
promised
her
that
a
flaming
hand
would
burn
in
the
sky
above
the
city
on
the
day
her
father’s
bones
went
west.
Between
coughs,
Lord
Gyles
told
her
that
he
had
hired
a
master
stonecarver
to
make
a
statue
of
Lord
Tywin,
to
stand
eternal
vigil
beside
the
Lion
Gate.
Ser
Lambert
Turnberry
appeared
with
a
patch
over
his
right
eye,
swearing
that
he
would
wear
it
until
he
could
bring
her
the
head
of
her
dwarf
brother.

No
sooner
had
the
queen
escaped
the
clutches
of
that
fool
than
she
found
herself
cornered
by
Lady
Falyse
of
Stokeworth
and
her
husband,
Ser
Balman
Byrch.
“My
lady
mother
sends
her
regrets,
Your
Grace,”
Falyse
burbled
at
her.
“Lollys
has
been
taken
to
bed
with
the
child
and
she
felt
the
need
to
stay
with
her.
She
begs
that
you
forgive
her,
and
said
I
should
ask
you...
my
mother
admired
your
late
father
above
all
other
men.
Should
my
sister
have
a
little
boy,
it
is
her
wish
that
we
might
name
him
Tywin,
if...
if
it
please
you.”

Cersei
stared
at
her,
aghast.
“Your
lackwit
sister
gets
herself
raped
by
half
of
King’s
Landing,
and
Tanda
thinks
to
honor
the
bastard
with
my
lord
father’s
name?
I
think
not.”

Falyse
flinched
back
as
if
she’d
been
slapped,
but
her
husband
only
stroked
his
thick
blond
mustache
with
a
thumb.
“I
told
Lady
Tanda
as
much.
We
shall
find
a
more,
ah...
a
more
fitting
name
for
Lollys’s
bastard,
you
have
my
word.”

“See
that
you
do.”
Cersei
showed
them
a
shoulder
and
moved
away.
Tommen
had
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
Margaery
Tyrell
and
her
grandmother,
she
saw.
The
Queen
of
Thorns
was
so
short
that
for
an
instant
Cersei
took
her
for
another
child.
Before
she
could
rescue
her
son
from
the
roses,
the
press
brought
her
face-to-face
with
her
uncle.
When
the
queen
reminded
him
of
their
meeting
later,
Ser
Kevan
gave
a
weary
nod
and
begged
leave
to
withdraw.
But
Lancel
lingered,
the
very
picture
of
a
man
with
one
foot
in
the
grave.
But
is
he
climbing
in
or
climbing
out?

Cersei
forced
herself
to
smile.
“Lancel,
I
am
happy
to
see
you
looking
so
much
stronger.
Maester
Ballabar
brought
us
such
dire
reports,
we
feared
for
your
life.
But
I
would
have
thought
you
on
your
way
to
Darry
by
now,
to
take
up
your
lordship.”
Her
father
had
made
Lancel
a
lord
after
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater,
as
a
sop
to
his
brother
Kevan.

“Not
as
yet.
There
are
outlaws
in
my
castle.”
Her
cousin’s
voice
was
as
wispy
as
the
mustache
on
his
upper
lip.
Though
his
hair
had
gone
white,
his
mustache
fuzz
remained
a
sandy
color.
Cersei
had
often
gazed
up
at
it
while
the
boy
was
inside
her,
pumping
dutifully
away.
It
looks
like
a
smudge
of
dirt
on
his
lip.
She
used
to
threaten
to
scrub
it
off
with
a
little
spit.
“The
riverlands
have
need
of
a
strong
hand,
my
father
says.”

A
pity
that
they’re
getting
yours,
she
wanted
to
say.
Instead
she
smiled.
“And
you
are
to
be
wed
as
well.”

A
gloomy
look
passed
across
the
young
knight’s
ravaged
face.
“A
Frey
girl,
and
not
of
my
choosing.
She
is
not
even
maiden.
A
widow,
of
Darry
blood.
My
father
says
that
will
help
me
with
the
peasants,
but
the
peasants
are
all
dead.”
He
reached
for
her
hand.
“It
is
cruel,
Cersei.
Your
Grace
knows
that
I
love—”

“—House
Lannister,”
she
finished
for
him.
“No
one
can
doubt
that,
Lancel.
May
your
wife
give
you
strong
sons.”
Best
not
let
her
lord
grandfather
host
the
wedding,
though.
“I
know
you
will
do
many
noble
deeds
in
Darry.”

Lancel
nodded,
plainly
miserable.
“When
it
seemed
that
I
might
die,
my
father
brought
the
High
Septon
to
pray
for
me.
He
is
a
good
man.”
Her
cousin’s
eyes
were
wet
and
shiny,
a
child’s
eyes
in
an
old
man’s
face.
“He
says
the
Mother
spared
me
for
some
holy
purpose,
so
I
might
atone
for
my
sins.”

Cersei
wondered
how
he
intended
to
atone
for
her.
Knighting
him
was
a
mistake,
and
bedding
him
a
bigger
one.
Lancel
was
a
weak
reed,
and
she
liked
his
newfound
piety
not
at
all;
he
had
been
much
more
amusing
when
he
was
trying
to
be
Jaime.
What
has
this
mewling
fool
told
the
High
Septon?
And
what
will
he
tell
his
little
Frey
when
they
lie
together
in
the
dark?
If
he
confessed
to
bedding
Cersei,
well,
she
could
weather
that.
Men
were
always
lying
about
women;
she
would
put
it
down
as
the
braggadocio
of
a
callow
boy
smitten
by
her
beauty.
If
he
sings
of
Robert
and
the
strongwine,
though...
“Atonement
is
best
achieved
through
prayer,”
Cersei
told
him.
“Silent
prayer.”
She
left
him
to
think
about
that
and
girded
herself
to
face
the
Tyrell
host.

Margaery
embraced
her
like
a
sister,
which
the
queen
found
presumptuous,
but
this
was
not
the
place
to
reproach
her.
Lady
Alerie
and
the
cousins
contented
themselves
with
kissing
fingers.
Lady
Graceford,
who
was
large
with
child,
asked
the
queen’s
leave
to
name
it
Tywin
if
it
were
a
boy,
or
Lanna
if
it
were
a
girl.
Another
one?
she
almost
groaned.
The
realm
will
drown
in
Tywins.
She
gave
consent
as
graciously
as
she
could,
feigning
delight.

It
was
Lady
Merryweather
who
truly
pleased
her.
“Your
Grace,”
that
one
said,
in
her
sultry
Myrish
tones,
“I
have
sent
word
to
my
friends
across
the
narrow
sea,
asking
them
to
seize
the
Imp
at
once
should
he
show
his
ugly
face
in
the
Free
Cities.”

“Do
you
have
many
friends
across
the
water?”

“In
Myr,
many.
In
Lys
as
well,
and
Tyrosh.
Men
of
power.”

Cersei
could
well
believe
it.
The
Myrish
woman
was
too
beautiful
by
half;
long-legged
and
full-breasted,
with
smooth
olive
skin,
ripe
lips,
huge
dark
eyes,
and
thick
black
hair
that
always
looked
as
if
she’d
just
come
from
bed.
She
even
smells
of
sin,
like
some
exotic
lotus.
“Lord
Merryweather
and
I
wish
only
to
serve
Your
Grace
and
the
little
king,”
the
woman
purred,
with
a
look
that
was
as
pregnant
as
Lady
Graceford.

This
one
is
ambitious,
and
her
lord
is
proud
but
poor.
“We
must
speak
again,
my
lady.
Taena,
is
it?
You
are
most
kind.
I
know
that
we
shall
be
great
friends.”

Then
the
Lord
of
Highgarden
descended
on
her.

Mace
Tyrell
was
no
more
than
ten
years
older
than
Cersei,
yet
she
thought
of
him
as
her
father’s
age,
not
her
own.
He
was
not
quite
so
tall
as
Lord
Tywin
had
been,
but
elsewise
he
was
bigger,
with
a
thick
chest
and
a
gut
grown
even
thicker.
His
hair
was
chestnut-colored,
but
there
were
specks
of
white
and
grey
in
his
beard.
His
face
was
often
red.
“Lord
Tywin
was
a
great
man,
an
extraordinary
man,”
he
declared
ponderously
after
he
had
kissed
both
her
cheeks.
“We
shall
never
see
his
like
again,
I
fear.”

You
are
looking
at
his
like,
fool,
Cersei
thought.
It
is
his
daughter
standing
here
before
you.
But
she
needed
Tyrell
and
the
strength
of
Highgarden
to
keep
Tommen
on
his
throne,
so
all
she
said
was,
“He
will
be
greatly
missed.”

Tyrell
put
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder.
“No
man
alive
is
fit
to
don
Lord
Tywin’s
armor,
that
is
plain.
Still,
the
realm
goes
on,
and
must
be
ruled.
If
there
is
aught
that
I
might
do
to
serve
in
this
dark
hour,
Your
Grace
need
only
ask.”

If
you
want
to
be
the
King’s
Hand,
my
lord,
have
the
courage
to
say
it
plainly.
The
queen
smiled.
Let
him
read
into
that
as
much
as
he
likes.
“Surely
my
lord
is
needed
in
the
Reach?”

“My
son
Willas
is
an
able
lad,”
the
man
replied,
refusing
to
take
her
perfectly
good
hint.
“His
leg
may
be
twisted
but
he
has
no
want
of
wits.
And
Garlan
will
soon
take
Brightwater.
Between
them
the
Reach
will
be
in
good
hands,
if
it
happens
that
I
am
needed
elsewhere.
The
governance
of
the
realm
must
come
first,
Lord
Tywin
often
said.
And
I
am
pleased
to
bring
Your
Grace
good
tidings
in
that
regard.
My
uncle
Garth
has
agreed
to
serve
as
master
of
coin,
as
your
lord
father
wished.
He
is
making
his
way
to
Oldtown
to
take
ship.
His
sons
will
accompany
him.
Lord
Tywin
mentioned
something
about
finding
places
for
the
two
of
them
as
well.
Perhaps
in
the
City
Watch.”

The
queen’s
smile
had
frozen
so
hard
she
feared
her
teeth
might
crack.
Garth
the
Gross
on
the
small
council
and
his
two
bastards
in
the
gold
cloaks...
do
the
Tyrells
think
I
will
just
serve
the
realm
up
to
them
on
a
gilded
platter?
The
arrogance
of
it
took
her
breath
away.

“Garth
has
served
me
well
as
Lord
Seneschal,
as
he
served
my
father
before
me,”
Tyrell
was
going
on.
“Littlefinger
had
a
nose
for
gold,
I
grant
you,
but
Garth—”

“My
lord,”
Cersei
broke
in,
“I
fear
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding.
I
have
asked
Lord
Gyles
Rosby
to
serve
as
our
new
master
of
coin,
and
he
has
done
me
the
honor
of
accepting.”

Mace
gaped
at
her.
“Rosby?
That...
cougher?
But...
the
matter
was
agreed,
Your
Grace.
Garth
is
on
his
way
to
Oldtown.”

“Best
send
a
raven
to
Lord
Hightower
and
ask
him
to
make
certain
your
uncle
does
not
take
ship.
We
would
hate
for
Garth
to
brave
an
autumn
sea
for
nought.”
She
smiled
pleasantly.

A
flush
crept
up
Tyrell’s
thick
neck.
“This...
your
lord
father
assured
me...”
He
began
to
sputter.

Then
his
mother
appeared
and
slid
her
arm
through
his
own.
“It
would
seem
that
Lord
Tywin
did
not
share
his
plans
with
our
regent,
I
can’t
imagine
why.
Still,
there
’tis,
no
use
hectoring
Her
Grace.
She
is
quite
right,
you
must
write
Lord
Leyton
before
Garth
boards
a
ship.
You
know
the
sea
will
sicken
him
and
make
his
farting
worse.”
Lady
Olenna
gave
Cersei
a
toothless
smile.
“Your
council
chambers
will
smell
sweeter
with
Lord
Gyles,
though
I
daresay
that
coughing
would
drive
me
to
distraction.
We
all
adore
dear
old
uncle
Garth,
but
the
man
is
flatulent,
that
cannot
be
gainsaid.
I
do
abhor
foul
smells.”
Her
wrinkled
face
wrinkled
up
even
more.
“I
caught
a
whiff
of
something
unpleasant
in
the
holy
sept,
in
truth.
Mayhaps
you
smelled
it
too?”

“No,”
Cersei
said
coldly.
“A
scent,
you
say?”

“More
like
a
stink.”

“Perhaps
you
miss
your
autumn
roses.
We
have
kept
you
here
too
long.”
The
sooner
she
rid
the
court
of
Lady
Olenna
the
better.
Lord
Tyrell
would
doubtless
dispatch
a
goodly
number
of
knights
to
see
his
mother
safely
home,
and
the
fewer
Tyrell
swords
in
the
city,
the
more
soundly
the
queen
would
sleep.

“I
do
long
for
the
fragrances
of
Highgarden,
I
confess
it,”
said
the
old
lady,
“but
of
course
I
cannot
leave
until
I
have
seen
my
sweet
Margaery
wed
to
your
precious
little
Tommen.”

“I
await
that
day
eagerly
as
well,”
Tyrell
put
in.
“Lord
Tywin
and
I
were
on
the
point
of
setting
a
date,
as
it
happens.
Perhaps
you
and
I
might
take
up
that
discussion,
Your
Grace.”

“Soon.”

“Soon
will
serve,”
said
Lady
Olenna
with
a
sniff.
“Now
come
along,
Mace,
let
Her
Grace
get
on
with
her...
grief.”

I
will
see
you
dead,
old
woman,
Cersei
promised
herself
as
the
Queen
of
Thorns
tottered
off
between
her
towering
guardsmen,
a
pair
of
seven-footers
that
it
amused
her
to
call
Left
and
Right.
We’ll
see
how
sweet
a
corpse
you
make.
The
old
woman
was
twice
as
clever
as
her
lord
son,
that
was
plain.

The
queen
rescued
her
son
from
Margaery
and
her
cousins,
and
made
for
the
doors.
Outside,
the
rain
had
finally
stopped.
The
autumn
air
smelled
sweet
and
fresh.
Tommen
took
his
crown
off.
“Put
that
back
on,”
Cersei
commanded
him.

“It
makes
my
neck
hurt,”
the
boy
said,
but
he
did
as
he
was
bid.
“Will
I
be
married
soon?
Margaery
says
that
as
soon
as
we’re
wed
we
can
go
to
Highgarden.”

“You
are
not
going
to
Highgarden,
but
you
can
ride
back
to
the
castle.”
Cersei
beckoned
to
Ser
Meryn
Trant.
“Bring
His
Grace
a
mount,
and
ask
Lord
Gyles
if
he
would
do
me
the
honor
of
sharing
my
litter.”
Things
were
moving
more
quickly
than
she
had
anticipated;
there
was
no
time
to
be
squandered.

Tommen
was
happy
at
the
prospect
of
a
ride,
and
of
course
Lord
Gyles
was
honored
by
her
invitation...
though
when
she
asked
him
to
be
her
master
of
coin,
he
began
coughing
so
violently
that
she
feared
he
might
die
right
then
and
there.
But
the
Mother
was
merciful,
and
Gyles
eventually
recovered
sufficiently
to
accept,
and
even
began
coughing
out
the
names
of
men
he
wanted
to
replace,
customs
officers
and
wool
factors
appointed
by
Littlefinger,
even
one
of
the
keepers
of
the
keys.

“Name
the
cow
what
you
will,
so
long
as
the
milk
flows.
And
should
the
question
arise,
you
joined
the
council
yesterday.”

“Yester—”
A
fit
of
coughing
bent
him
over.
“Yesterday.
To
be
sure.”
Lord
Gyles
coughed
into
a
square
of
red
silk,
as
if
to
hide
the
blood
in
his
spittle.
Cersei
pretended
not
to
notice.

When
he
dies
I
will
find
someone
else.
Perhaps
she
would
recall
Littlefinger.
The
queen
could
not
imagine
that
Petyr
Baelish
would
be
allowed
to
remain
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale
for
very
long,
with
Lysa
Arryn
dead.
The
Vale
lords
were
already
stirring,
if
what
Pycelle
said
was
true.
Once
they
take
that
wretched
boy
away
from
him,
Lord
Petyr
will
come
crawling
back.

“Your
Grace?”
Lord
Gyles
coughed,
and
dabbed
his
mouth.
“Might
I...”
He
coughed
again.
“...ask
who...”
Another
series
of
coughs
racked
him.
“...who
will
be
the
King’s
Hand?”

“My
uncle,”
she
replied
absently.

It
was
a
relief
to
see
the
gates
of
the
Red
Keep
looming
large
before
her.
She
gave
Tommen
over
to
the
charge
of
his
squires
and
retired
gratefully
to
her
own
chambers
to
rest.

No
sooner
had
she
eased
off
her
shoes
than
Jocelyn
entered
timidly
to
say
that
Qyburn
was
without
and
craved
audience.
“Send
him
in,”
the
queen
commanded.
A
ruler
gets
no
rest.

Qyburn
was
old,
but
his
hair
still
had
more
ash
than
snow
in
it,
and
the
laugh
lines
around
his
mouth
made
him
look
like
some
little
girl’s
favorite
grandfather.
A
rather
shabby
grandfather,
though.
The
collar
of
his
robe
was
frayed,
and
one
sleeve
had
been
torn
and
badly
sewn.
“I
must
beg
Your
Grace’s
pardon
for
my
appearance,”
he
said.
“I
have
been
down
in
the
dungeons
making
inquiries
into
the
Imp’s
escape,
as
you
commanded.”

“And
what
have
you
discovered?”

“The
night
that
Lord
Varys
and
your
brother
disappeared,
a
third
man
also
vanished.”

“Yes,
the
gaoler.
What
of
him?”

“Rugen
was
the
man’s
name.
An
undergaoler
who
had
charge
of
the
black
cells.
The
chief
undergaoler
describes
him
as
portly,
unshaven,
gruff
of
speech.
He
held
his
appointment
of
the
old
king,
Aerys,
and
came
and
went
as
he
pleased.
The
black
cells
have
not
oft
been
occupied
in
recent
years.
The
other
turnkeys
were
afraid
of
him,
it
seems,
but
none
knew
much
about
him.
He
had
no
friends,
no
kin.
Nor
did
he
drink
or
frequent
brothels.
His
sleeping
cell
was
damp
and
dreary,
and
the
straw
he
slept
upon
was
mildewed.
His
chamber
pot
was
overflowing.”

“I
know
all
this.”
Jaime
had
examined
Rugen’s
cell,
and
Ser
Addam’s
gold
cloaks
had
examined
it
again.

“Aye,
Your
Grace,”
said
Qyburn,
“but
did
you
know
that
under
that
stinking
chamber
pot
was
a
loose
stone,
which
opened
on
a
small
hollow?
The
sort
of
place
where
a
man
might
hide
valuables
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
discovered?”

“Valuables?”
This
was
new.
“Coin,
you
mean?”
She
had
suspected
all
along
that
Tyrion
had
somehow
bought
this
gaoler.

“Beyond
a
doubt.
To
be
sure,
the
hole
was
empty
when
I
found
it.
No
doubt
Rugen
took
his
ill-gotten
treasure
with
him
when
he
fled.
But
as
I
crouched
over
the
hole
with
my
torch,
I
saw
something
glitter,
so
I
scratched
in
the
dirt
until
I
dug
it
out.”
Qyburn
opened
his
palm.
“A
gold
coin.”

Gold,
yes,
but
the
moment
Cersei
took
it
she
could
tell
that
it
was
wrong.
Too
small,
she
thought,
too
thin.
The
coin
was
old
and
worn.
On
one
side
was
a
king’s
face
in
profile,
on
the
other
side
the
imprint
of
a
hand.
“This
is
no
dragon,”
she
said.

“No,”
Qyburn
agreed.
“It
dates
from
before
the
Conquest,
Your
Grace.
The
king
is
Garth
the
Twelfth,
and
the
hand
is
the
sigil
of
House
Gardener.”

Of
Highgarden.
Cersei
closed
her
hand
around
the
coin.
What
treachery
is
this?
Mace
Tyrell
had
been
one
of
Tyrion’s
judges,
and
had
called
loudly
for
his
death.
Was
that
some
ploy?
Could
he
have
been
plotting
with
the
Imp
all
the
while,
conspiring
at
Father’s
death?
With
Tywin
Lannister
in
his
grave,
Lord
Tyrell
was
an
obvious
choice
to
be
King’s
Hand,
but
even
so...
“You
will
not
speak
of
this
with
anyone,”
she
commanded.

“Your
Grace
may
trust
in
my
discretion.
Any
man
who
rides
with
a
sellsword
company
learns
to
hold
his
tongue,
else
he
does
not
keep
it
long.”

“In
my
company
as
well.”
The
queen
put
the
coin
away.
She
would
think
about
it
later.
“What
of
the
other
matter?”

“Ser
Gregor.”
Qyburn
shrugged.
“I
have
examined
him,
as
you
commanded.
The
poison
on
the
Viper’s
spear
was
manticore
venom
from
the
east,
I
would
stake
my
life
on
that.”

“Pycelle
says
no.
He
told
my
lord
father
that
manticore
venom
kills
the
instant
it
reaches
the
heart.”

“And
so
it
does.
But
this
venom
has
been
thickened
somehow,
so
as
to
draw
out
the
Mountain’s
dying.”

“Thickened?
Thickened
how?
With
some
other
substance?”

“It
may
be
as
Your
Grace
suggests,
though
in
most
cases
adulterating
a
poison
only
lessens
its
potency.
It
may
be
that
the
cause
is...
less
natural,
let
us
say.
A
spell,
I
think.”

Is
this
one
as
big
a
fool
as
Pycelle?
“So
are
you
telling
me
that
the
Mountain
is
dying
of
some
black
sorcery?”

Qyburn
ignored
the
mockery
in
her
voice.
“He
is
dying
of
the
venom,
but
slowly,
and
in
exquisite
agony.
My
efforts
to
ease
his
pain
have
proved
as
fruitless
as
Pycelle’s.
Ser
Gregor
is
overly
accustomed
to
the
poppy,
I
fear.
His
squire
tells
me
that
he
is
plagued
by
blinding
headaches
and
oft
quaffs
the
milk
of
the
poppy
as
lesser
men
quaff
ale.
Be
that
as
it
may,
his
veins
have
turned
black
from
head
to
heel,
his
water
is
clouded
with
pus,
and
the
venom
has
eaten
a
hole
in
his
side
as
large
as
my
fist.
It
is
a
wonder
that
the
man
is
still
alive,
if
truth
be
told.”

“His
size,”
the
queen
suggested,
frowning.
“Gregor
is
a
very
large
man.
Also
a
very
stupid
one.
Too
stupid
to
know
when
he
should
die,
it
seems.”
She
held
out
her
cup,
and
Senelle
filled
it
once
again.
“His
screaming
frightens
Tommen.
It
has
even
been
known
to
wake
me
of
a
night.
I
would
say
it
is
past
time
we
summoned
Ilyn
Payne.”

“Your
Grace,”
said
Qyburn,
“mayhaps
I
might
move
Ser
Gregor
to
the
dungeons?
His
screams
will
not
disturb
you
there,
and
I
will
be
able
to
tend
to
him
more
freely.”

“Tend
to
him?”
She
laughed.
“Let
Ser
Ilyn
tend
to
him.”

“If
that
is
Your
Grace’s
wish,”
Qyburn
said,
“but
this
poison...
it
would
be
useful
to
know
more
about
it,
would
it
not?
Send
a
knight
to
slay
a
knight
and
an
archer
to
kill
an
archer,
the
smallfolk
often
say.
To
combat
the
black
arts...”
He
did
not
finish
the
thought,
but
only
smiled
at
her.

He
is
not
Pycelle,
that
much
is
plain.
The
queen
weighed
him,
wondering.
“Why
did
the
Citadel
take
your
chain?”

“The
archmaesters
are
all
craven
at
heart.
The
grey
sheep,
Marwyn
calls
them.
I
was
as
skilled
a
healer
as
Ebrose,
but
aspired
to
surpass
him.
For
hundreds
of
years
the
men
of
the
Citadel
have
opened
the
bodies
of
the
dead,
to
study
the
nature
of
life.
I
wished
to
understand
the
nature
of
death,
so
I
opened
the
bodies
of
the
living.
For
that
crime
the
grey
sheep
shamed
me
and
forced
me
into
exile...
but
I
understand
the
nature
of
life
and
death
better
than
any
man
in
Oldtown.”

“Do
you?”
That
intrigued
her.
“Very
well.
The
Mountain
is
yours.
Do
what
you
will
with
him,
but
confine
your
studies
to
the
black
cells.
When
he
dies,
bring
me
his
head.
My
father
promised
it
to
Dorne.
Prince
Doran
would
no
doubt
prefer
to
kill
Gregor
himself,
but
we
all
must
suffer
disappointments
in
this
life.”

“Very
good,
Your
Grace.”
Qyburn
cleared
his
throat.
“I
am
not
so
well
provided
as
Pycelle,
however.
I
must
needs
equip
myself
with
certain...”

“I
shall
instruct
Lord
Gyles
to
provide
you
with
gold
sufficient
for
your
needs.
Buy
yourself
some
new
robes
as
well.
You
look
as
though
you’ve
wandered
up
from
Flea
Bottom.”
She
studied
his
eyes,
wondering
how
far
she
dared
trust
this
one.
“Need
I
say
that
it
will
go
ill
for
you
if
any
word
of
your...
labors...
should
pass
beyond
these
walls?”

“No,
Your
Grace.”
Qyburn
gave
her
a
reassuring
smile.
“Your
secrets
are
safe
with
me.”

When
he
was
gone,
Cersei
poured
herself
a
cup
of
strongwine
and
drank
it
by
the
window,
watching
the
shadows
lengthen
across
the
yard
and
thinking
about
the
coin.
Gold
from
the
Reach.
Why
would
an
undergaoler
in
King’s
Landing
have
gold
from
the
Reach,
unless
he
were
paid
to
help
bring
about
Father’s
death?

Try
as
she
might,
she
could
not
seem
to
bring
Lord
Tywin’s
face
to
mind
without
seeing
that
silly
little
half
smile
and
remembering
the
foul
smell
coming
off
his
corpse.
She
wondered
whether
Tyrion
was
somehow
behind
that
as
well.
It
is
small
and
cruel,
like
him.
Could
Tyrion
have
made
Pycelle
his
catspaw?
He
sent
the
old
man
to
the
black
cells,
and
this
Rugen
had
charge
of
those
cells,
she
remembered.
All
the
strings
were
tangled
up
together
in
ways
she
did
not
like.
This
High
Septon
is
Tyrion’s
creature
too,
Cersei
recalled
suddenly,
and
Father’s
poor
body
was
in
his
care
from
dark
till
dawn.

Her
uncle
arrived
promptly
at
sunset,
wearing
a
quilted
doublet
of
charcoal-colored
wool
as
somber
as
his
face.
Like
all
the
Lannisters,
Ser
Kevan
was
fair-skinned
and
blond,
though
at
five-and-fifty
he
had
lost
most
of
his
hair.
No
one
would
ever
call
him
comely.
Thick
of
waist,
round
of
shoulder,
with
a
square
jutting
chin
that
his
close-cropped
yellow
beard
did
little
to
conceal,
he
reminded
her
of
some
old
mastiff...
but
a
faithful
old
mastiff
was
the
very
thing
that
she
required.

They
ate
a
simple
supper
of
beets
and
bread
and
bloody
beef
with
a
flagon
of
Dornish
red
to
wash
it
all
down.
Ser
Kevan
said
little
and
scarce
touched
his
wine
cup.
He
broods
too
much,
she
decided.
He
needs
to
be
put
to
work
to
get
beyond
his
grief.

She
said
as
much,
when
the
last
of
the
food
had
been
cleared
away
and
the
servants
had
departed.
“I
know
how
much
my
father
relied
on
you,
Uncle.
Now
I
must
do
the
same.”

“You
need
a
Hand,”
he
said,
“and
Jaime
has
refused
you.”

He
is
blunt.
Very
well.
“Jaime...
I
felt
so
lost
with
Father
dead,
I
scarce
knew
what
I
was
saying.
Jaime
is
gallant,
but
a
bit
of
a
fool,
let
us
be
frank.
Tommen
needs
a
more
seasoned
man.
Someone
older...”

“Mace
Tyrell
is
older.”

Her
nostrils
flared.
“Never.”
Cersei
pushed
a
lock
of
hair
off
her
brow.
“The
Tyrells
overreach
themselves.”

“You
would
be
a
fool
to
make
Mace
Tyrell
your
Hand,”
Ser
Kevan
admitted,
“but
a
bigger
fool
to
make
him
your
foe.
I’ve
heard
what
happened
in
the
Hall
of
Lamps.
Mace
should
have
known
better
than
to
broach
such
matters
in
public,
but
even
so,
you
were
unwise
to
shame
him
in
front
of
half
the
court.”

“Better
that
than
suffer
another
Tyrell
on
the
council.”
His
reproach
annoyed
her.
“Rosby
will
make
an
adequate
master
of
coin.
You’ve
seen
that
litter
of
his,
with
its
carvings
and
silk
draperies.
His
horses
are
better
dressed
than
most
knights.
A
man
that
rich
should
have
no
problem
finding
gold.
As
for
Handship...
who
better
to
finish
my
father’s
work
than
the
brother
who
shared
all
his
counsels?”

“Every
man
needs
someone
he
can
trust.
Tywin
had
me,
and
once
your
mother.”

“He
loved
her
very
much.”
Cersei
refused
to
think
about
the
dead
whore
in
his
bed.
“I
know
they
are
together
now.”

“So
I
pray.”
Ser
Kevan
studied
her
face
for
a
long
moment
before
he
replied.
“You
ask
much
of
me,
Cersei.”

“No
more
than
my
father
did.”

“I
am
tired.”
Her
uncle
reached
for
his
wine
cup
and
took
a
swallow.
“I
have
a
wife
I
have
not
seen
in
two
years,
a
dead
son
to
mourn,
another
son
about
to
marry
and
assume
a
lordship.
Castle
Darry
must
be
made
strong
again,
its
lands
protected,
its
burned
fields
plowed
and
planted
anew.
Lancel
needs
my
help.”

“As
does
Tommen.”
Cersei
had
not
expected
Kevan
to
require
coaxing.
He
never
played
coy
with
Father.
“The
realm
needs
you.”

“The
realm.
Aye.
And
House
Lannister.”
He
sipped
his
wine
again.
“Very
well.
I
will
remain
and
serve
His
Grace...”

“Very
good,”
she
started
to
say,
but
Ser
Kevan
raised
his
voice
and
bulled
right
over
her.

“...so
long
as
you
name
me
regent
as
well
as
Hand
and
take
yourself
back
to
Casterly
Rock.”

For
half
a
heartbeat
Cersei
could
only
stare
at
him.
“I
am
the
regent,”
she
reminded
him.

“You
were.
Tywin
did
not
intend
that
you
continue
in
that
role.
He
told
me
of
his
plans
to
send
you
back
to
the
Rock
and
find
a
new
husband
for
you.”

Cersei
could
feel
her
anger
rising.
“He
spoke
of
such,
yes.
And
I
told
him
it
was
not
my
wish
to
wed
again.”

Her
uncle
was
unmoved.
“If
you
are
resolved
against
another
marriage,
I
will
not
force
it
on
you.
As
to
the
other,
though...
you
are
the
Lady
of
Casterly
Rock
now.
Your
place
is
there.”

How
dare
you?
she
wanted
to
scream.
Instead,
she
said,
“I
am
also
the
Queen
Regent.
My
place
is
with
my
son.”

“Your
father
thought
not.”

“My
father
is
dead.”

“To
my
grief,
and
the
woe
of
all
the
realm.
Open
your
eyes
and
look
about
you,
Cersei.
The
kingdom
is
in
ruins.
Tywin
might
have
been
able
to
set
matters
aright,
but...”

“I
shall
set
matters
aright!”
Cersei
softened
her
tone.
“With
your
help,
Uncle.
If
you
will
serve
me
as
faithfully
as
you
served
my
father—”

“You
are
not
your
father.
And
Tywin
always
regarded
Jaime
as
his
rightful
heir.”

“Jaime...
Jaime
has
taken
vows.
Jaime
never
thinks,
he
laughs
at
everything
and
everyone
and
says
whatever
comes
into
his
head.
Jaime
is
a
handsome
fool.”

“And
yet
he
was
your
first
choice
to
be
the
King’s
Hand.
What
does
that
make
you,
Cersei?”

“I
told
you,
I
was
sick
with
grief,
I
did
not
think—”

“No,”
Ser
Kevan
agreed.
“Which
is
why
you
should
return
to
Casterly
Rock
and
leave
the
king
with
those
who
do.”

“The
king
is
my
son!”
Cersei
rose
to
her
feet.

“Aye,”
her
uncle
said,
“and
from
what
I
saw
of
Joffrey,
you
are
as
unfit
a
mother
as
you
are
a
ruler.”

She
threw
the
contents
of
her
wine
cup
full
in
his
face.

Ser
Kevan
rose
with
a
ponderous
dignity.
“Your
Grace.”
Wine
trickled
down
his
cheeks
and
dripped
from
his
close-cropped
beard.
“With
your
leave,
might
I
withdraw?”

“By
what
right
do
you
presume
to
give
me
terms?
You
are
no
more
than
one
of
my
father’s
household
knights.”

“I
hold
no
lands,
that
is
true.
But
I
have
certain
incomes,
and
chests
of
coin
set
aside.
My
own
father
forgot
none
of
his
children
when
he
died,
and
Tywin
knew
how
to
reward
good
service.
I
feed
two
hundred
knights
and
can
double
that
number
if
need
be.
There
are
freeriders
who
will
follow
my
banner,
and
I
have
the
gold
to
hire
sellswords.
You
would
be
wise
not
to
take
me
lightly,
Your
Grace...
and
wiser
still
not
to
make
of
me
a
foe.”

“Are
you
threatening
me?”

“I
am
counseling
you.
If
you
will
not
yield
the
regency
to
me,
name
me
your
castellan
for
Casterly
Rock
and
make
either
Mathis
Rowan
or
Randyll
Tarly
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

Tyrell
bannermen,
both
of
them.
The
suggestion
left
her
speechless.
Is
he
bought?
she
wondered.
Has
he
taken
Tyrell
gold
to
betray
House
Lannister?

“Mathis
Rowan
is
sensible,
prudent,
well
liked,”
her
uncle
went
on,
oblivious.
“Randyll
Tarly
is
the
finest
soldier
in
the
realm.
A
poor
Hand
for
peacetime,
but
with
Tywin
dead
there’s
no
better
man
to
finish
this
war.
Lord
Tyrell
cannot
take
offense
if
you
choose
one
of
his
own
bannermen
as
Hand.
Both
Tarly
and
Rowan
are
able
men...
and
loyal.
Name
either
one,
and
you
make
him
yours.
You
strengthen
yourself
and
weaken
Highgarden,
yet
Mace
will
likely
thank
you
for
it.”
He
gave
a
shrug.
“That
is
my
counsel,
take
it
or
no.
You
may
make
Moon
Boy
your
Hand
for
all
I
care.
My
brother
is
dead,
woman.
I
am
going
to
take
him
home.”

Traitor,
she
thought.
Turncloak.
She
wondered
how
much
Mace
Tyrell
had
given
him.
“You
would
abandon
your
king
when
he
needs
you
most,”
she
told
him.
“You
would
abandon
Tommen.”

“Tommen
has
his
mother.”
Ser
Kevan’s
green
eyes
met
her
own,
unblinking.
A
last
drop
of
wine
trembled
wet
and
red
beneath
his
chin,
and
finally
fell.
“Aye,”
he
added
softly,
after
a
pause,
“and
his
father
too,
I
think.”





JAIME

Ser
Jaime
Lannister,
all
in
white,
stood
beside
his
father’s
bier,
five
fingers
curled
about
the
hilt
of
a
golden
greatsword.

At
dusk,
the
interior
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
turned
dim
and
eerie.
The
last
light
of
day
slanted
down
through
the
high
windows,
washing
the
towering
likenesses
of
the
Seven
in
a
red
gloom.
Around
their
altars,
scented
candles
flickered
whilst
deep
shadows
gathered
in
the
transepts
and
crept
silently
across
the
marble
floors.
The
echoes
of
the
evensongs
died
away
as
the
last
mourners
were
departing.

Balon
Swann
and
Loras
Tyrell
remained
when
the
rest
had
gone.
“No
man
can
stand
a
vigil
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights,”
Ser
Balon
said.
“When
did
you
last
sleep,
my
lord?”

“When
my
lord
father
was
alive,”
said
Jaime.

“Allow
me
to
stand
tonight
in
your
stead,”
Ser
Loras
offered.

“He
was
not
your
father.”
You
did
not
kill
him.
I
did.
Tyrion
may
have
loosed
the
crossbow
bolt
that
slew
him,
but
I
loosed
Tyrion.
“Leave
me.”

“As
my
lord
commands,”
said
Swann.
Ser
Loras
looked
as
if
he
might
have
argued
further,
but
Ser
Balon
took
his
arm
and
drew
him
off.
Jaime
listened
to
the
echoes
of
their
footfalls
die
away.
And
then
he
was
alone
again
with
his
lord
father,
amongst
the
candles
and
the
crystals
and
the
sickly
sweet
smell
of
death.
His
back
ached
from
the
weight
of
his
armor,
and
his
legs
felt
almost
numb.
He
shifted
his
stance
a
bit
and
tightened
his
fingers
around
the
golden
greatsword.
He
could
not
wield
a
sword,
but
he
could
hold
one.
His
missing
hand
was
throbbing.
That
was
almost
funny.
He
had
more
feeling
in
the
hand
he’d
lost
than
in
the
rest
of
the
body
that
remained
to
him.

My
hand
is
hungry
for
a
sword.
I
need
to
kill
someone.
Varys,
for
a
start,
but
first
I’d
need
to
find
the
rock
he’s
hiding
under.
“I
commanded
the
eunuch
to
take
him
to
a
ship,
not
to
your
bedchamber,”
he
told
the
corpse.
“The
blood
is
on
his
hands
as
much
as...
as
Tyrion’s.”
The
blood
is
on
his
hands
as
much
as
mine,
he
meant
to
say,
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat.
Whatever
Varys
did,
I
made
him
do.

He
had
waited
in
the
eunuch’s
chambers
that
night,
when
at
last
he
had
decided
not
to
let
his
little
brother
die.
As
he
waited,
he
had
sharpened
his
dagger
with
one
hand,
taking
a
queer
comfort
from
the
scrape-scrape-scrape
of
steel
on
stone.
At
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
stood
beside
the
door.
Varys
entered
in
a
wash
of
powder
and
lavender.
Jaime
stepped
out
behind
him,
kicked
him
in
the
back
of
the
knee,
knelt
on
his
chest,
and
shoved
the
knife
up
under
his
soft
white
chin,
forcing
his
head
up.
“Why,
Lord
Varys,”
he’d
said
pleasantly,
“fancy
meeting
you
here.”

“Ser
Jaime?”
Varys
panted.
“You
frightened
me.”

“I
meant
to.”
When
he
twisted
the
dagger,
a
trickle
of
blood
ran
down
the
blade.
“I
was
thinking
you
might
help
me
pluck
my
brother
from
his
cell
before
Ser
Ilyn
lops
his
head
off.
It
is
an
ugly
head,
I
grant
you,
but
he
only
has
the
one.”

“Yes...
well...
if
you
would...
remove
the
blade...
yes,
gently,
as
it
please
my
lord,
gently,
oh,
I’m
pricked...”
The
eunuch
touched
his
neck
and
gaped
at
the
blood
on
his
fingers.
“I
have
always
abhorred
the
sight
of
my
own
blood.”

“You’ll
have
more
to
abhor
shortly,
unless
you
help
me.”

Varys
struggled
to
a
sitting
position.
“Your
brother...
if
the
Imp
should
vanish
unaccountably
from
his
cell,
q-questions
would
be
asked.
I
would
f-fear
for
my
life...”

“Your
life
is
mine.
I
do
not
care
what
secrets
you
know.
If
Tyrion
dies,
you
will
not
long
outlive
him,
I
promise
you.”

“Ah.”
The
eunuch
sucked
the
blood
off
his
fingers.
“You
ask
a
dreadful
thing...
to
loose
the
Imp
who
slew
our
lovely
king.
Or
is
it
that
you
believe
him
innocent?”

“Innocent
or
guilty,”
Jaime
had
said,
like
the
fool
he
was,
“a
Lannister
pays
his
debts.”
The
words
had
come
so
easy.

He
had
not
slept
since.
He
could
see
his
brother
now,
the
way
the
dwarf
had
grinned
beneath
the
stub
of
his
nose
as
the
torchlight
licked
his
face.
“You
poor
stupid
blind
crippled
fool,”
he’d
snarled,
in
a
voice
thick
with
malice.
“Cersei
is
a
lying
whore,
she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
probably
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know.
And
I
am
the
monster
they
all
say
I
am.
Yes,
I
killed
your
vile
son.”

He
never
said
he
meant
to
kill
our
father.
If
he
had,
I
would
have
stopped
him.
Then
I
would
be
the
kinslayer,
not
him.

Jaime
wondered
where
Varys
was
hiding.
Wisely,
the
master
of
whisperers
had
not
returned
to
his
own
chambers,
nor
had
a
search
of
the
Red
Keep
turned
him
up.
It
might
be
that
the
eunuch
had
taken
ship
with
Tyrion,
rather
than
remain
to
answer
awkward
questions.
If
so,
the
two
of
them
were
well
out
to
sea
by
now,
sharing
a
flagon
of
Arbor
gold
in
the
cabin
of
a
galley.

Unless
my
brother
murdered
Varys
too,
and
left
his
corpse
to
rot
beneath
the
castle.
Down
there,
it
might
be
years
before
his
bones
were
found.
Jaime
had
led
a
dozen
guards
below,
with
torches
and
ropes
and
lanterns.
For
hours
they
had
groped
through
twisting
passages,
narrow
crawl
spaces,
hidden
doors,
secret
steps,
and
shafts
that
plunged
down
into
utter
blackness.
Seldom
had
he
felt
so
utterly
a
cripple.
A
man
takes
much
for
granted
when
he
has
two
hands.
Ladders,
for
an
instance.
Even
crawling
did
not
come
easy;
not
for
nought
do
they
speak
of
hands
and
knees.
Nor
could
he
hold
a
torch
and
climb,
as
others
could.

And
all
for
naught.
They
found
only
darkness,
dust,
and
rats.
And
dragons,
lurking
down
below.
He
remembered
the
sullen
orange
glow
of
the
coals
in
the
iron
dragon’s
mouth.
The
brazier
warmed
a
chamber
at
the
bottom
of
a
shaft
where
half
a
dozen
tunnels
met.
On
the
floor
he’d
found
a
scuffed
mosaic
of
the
three-headed
dragon
of
House
Targaryen
done
in
tiles
of
black
and
red.
I
know
you,
Kingslayer,
the
beast
seemed
to
be
saying.
I
have
been
here
all
the
time,
waiting
for
you
to
come
to
me.
And
it
seemed
to
Jaime
that
he
knew
that
voice,
the
iron
tones
that
had
once
belonged
to
Rhaegar,
Prince
of
Dragonstone.

The
day
had
been
windy
when
he
said
farewell
to
Rhaegar,
in
the
yard
of
the
Red
Keep.
The
prince
had
donned
his
night-black
armor,
with
the
three-headed
dragon
picked
out
in
rubies
on
his
breastplate.
“Your
Grace,”
Jaime
had
pleaded,
“let
Darry
stay
to
guard
the
king
this
once,
or
Ser
Barristan.
Their
cloaks
are
as
white
as
mine.”

Prince
Rhaegar
shook
his
head.
“My
royal
sire
fears
your
father
more
than
he
does
our
cousin
Robert.
He
wants
you
close,
so
Lord
Tywin
cannot
harm
him.
I
dare
not
take
that
crutch
away
from
him
at
such
an
hour.”

Jaime’s
anger
had
risen
up
in
his
throat.
“I
am
not
a
crutch.
I
am
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Then
guard
the
king,”
Ser
Jon
Darry
snapped
at
him.
“When
you
donned
that
cloak,
you
promised
to
obey.”

Rhaegar
had
put
his
hand
on
Jaime’s
shoulder.
“When
this
battle’s
done
I
mean
to
call
a
council.
Changes
will
be
made.
I
meant
to
do
it
long
ago,
but...
well,
it
does
no
good
to
speak
of
roads
not
taken.
We
shall
talk
when
I
return.”

Those
were
the
last
words
Rhaegar
Targaryen
ever
spoke
to
him.
Outside
the
gates
an
army
had
assembled,
whilst
another
descended
on
the
Trident.
So
the
Prince
of
Dragonstone
mounted
up
and
donned
his
tall
black
helm,
and
rode
forth
to
his
doom.

He
was
more
right
than
he
knew.
When
the
battle
was
done,
there
were
changes
made.
“Aerys
thought
no
harm
could
come
to
him
if
he
kept
me
near,”
he
told
his
father’s
corpse.
“Isn’t
that
amusing?”
Lord
Tywin
seemed
to
think
so;
his
smile
was
wider
than
before.
He
seems
to
enjoy
being
dead.

It
was
queer,
but
he
felt
no
grief.
Where
are
my
tears?
Where
is
my
rage?
Jaime
Lannister
had
never
lacked
for
rage.
“Father,”
he
told
the
corpse,
“it
was
you
who
told
me
that
tears
were
a
mark
of
weakness
in
a
man,
so
you
cannot
expect
that
I
should
cry
for
you.”

A
thousand
lords
and
ladies
had
come
that
morning
to
file
past
the
bier,
and
several
thousand
smallfolk
after
noon.
They
wore
somber
clothes
and
solemn
faces,
but
Jaime
suspected
that
many
and
more
were
secretly
delighted
to
see
the
great
man
brought
low.
Even
in
the
west,
Lord
Tywin
had
been
more
respected
than
beloved,
and
King’s
Landing
still
remembered
the
Sack.

Of
all
the
mourners,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
seemed
the
most
distraught.
“I
have
served
six
kings,”
he
told
Jaime
after
the
second
service,
whilst
sniffing
doubtfully
about
the
corpse,
“but
here
before
us
lies
the
greatest
man
I
ever
knew.
Lord
Tywin
wore
no
crown,
yet
he
was
all
a
king
should
be.”

Without
his
beard,
Pycelle
looked
not
only
old,
but
feeble.
Shaving
him
was
the
cruelest
thing
Tyrion
could
have
done,
thought
Jaime,
who
knew
what
it
was
to
lose
a
part
of
yourself,
the
part
that
made
you
who
you
were.
Pycelle’s
beard
had
been
magnificent,
white
as
snow
and
soft
as
lambswool,
a
luxuriant
growth
that
covered
cheeks
and
chin
and
flowed
down
almost
to
his
belt.
The
Grand
Maester
had
been
wont
to
stroke
it
when
he
pontificated.
It
had
given
him
an
air
of
wisdom,
and
concealed
all
manner
of
unsavory
things:
the
loose
skin
dangling
beneath
the
old
man’s
jaw,
the
small
querulous
mouth
and
missing
teeth,
warts
and
wrinkles
and
age
spots
too
numerous
to
count.
Though
Pycelle
was
trying
to
regrow
what
he
had
lost,
he
was
failing.
Only
wisps
and
tufts
sprouted
from
his
wrinkled
cheeks
and
weak
chin,
so
thin
that
Jaime
could
see
the
splotchy
pink
skin
beneath.

“Ser
Jaime,
I
have
seen
terrible
things
in
my
time,”
the
old
man
said.
“Wars,
battles,
murders
most
foul...
I
was
a
boy
in
Oldtown
when
the
grey
plague
took
half
the
city
and
three-quarters
of
the
Citadel.
Lord
Hightower
burned
every
ship
in
port,
closed
the
gates,
and
commanded
his
guards
to
slay
all
those
who
tried
to
flee,
be
they
men,
women,
or
babes
in
arms.
They
killed
him
when
the
plague
had
run
its
course.
On
the
very
day
he
reopened
the
port,
they
dragged
him
from
his
horse
and
slit
his
throat,
and
his
young
son’s
as
well.
To
this
day
the
ignorant
in
Oldtown
will
spit
at
the
sound
of
his
name,
but
Quenton
Hightower
did
what
was
needed.
Your
father
was
that
sort
of
man
as
well.
A
man
who
did
what
was
needed.”

“Is
that
why
he
looks
so
pleased
with
himself?”

The
vapors
rising
from
the
corpse
were
making
Pycelle’s
eyes
water.
“The
flesh...
as
the
flesh
dries,
the
muscles
grow
taut
and
pull
his
lips
upward.
That
is
no
smile,
only
a...
a
drying,
that
is
all.”
He
blinked
back
tears.
“You
must
excuse
me.
I
am
so
very
tired.”
Leaning
heavily
on
his
cane,
Pycelle
tottered
slowly
from
the
sept.
That
one
is
dying
too,
Jaime
realized.
Small
wonder
Cersei
called
him
useless.

To
be
sure,
his
sweet
sister
seemed
to
think
half
the
court
was
either
useless
or
treasonous;
Pycelle,
the
Kingsguard,
the
Tyrells,
Jaime
himself...
even
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
the
silent
knight
who
served
as
headsman.
As
King’s
Justice,
the
dungeons
were
his
responsibility.
Since
he
lacked
a
tongue,
Payne
had
largely
left
the
running
of
those
dungeons
to
his
underlings,
but
Cersei
held
him
to
blame
for
Tyrion’s
escape
all
the
same.
It
was
my
work,
not
his,
Jaime
almost
told
her.
Instead
he
had
promised
to
find
what
answers
he
could
from
the
chief
undergaoler,
a
bentback
old
man
named
Rennifer
Longwaters.

“I
see
you
wonder,
what
sort
of
name
is
that?”
the
man
had
cackled
when
Jaime
went
to
question
him.
“It
is
an
old
name,
’tis
true.
I
am
not
one
to
boast,
but
there
is
royal
blood
in
my
veins.
I
am
descended
from
a
princess.
My
father
told
me
the
tale
when
I
was
a
tad
of
a
lad.”
Longwaters
had
not
been
a
tad
of
a
lad
for
many
a
year,
to
judge
from
his
spotted
head
and
the
white
hairs
growing
from
his
chin.
“She
was
the
fairest
treasure
of
the
Maidenvault.
Lord
Oakenfist
the
great
admiral
lost
his
heart
to
her,
though
he
was
married
to
another.
She
gave
their
son
the
bastard
name
of
‘Waters’
in
honor
of
his
father,
and
he
grew
to
be
a
great
knight,
as
did
his
own
son,
who
put
the
‘Long’
before
the
‘Waters’
so
men
might
know
that
he
was
not
basely
born
himself.
So
I
have
a
little
dragon
in
me.”

“Yes,
I
almost
mistook
you
for
Aegon
the
Conqueror,”
Jaime
had
answered.
“Waters”
was
a
common
bastard
name
about
Blackwater
Bay;
old
Longwaters
was
more
like
to
be
descended
from
some
minor
household
knight
than
from
a
princess.
“As
it
matters,
though,
I
have
more
pressing
concerns
than
your
lineage.”

Longwaters
inclined
his
head.
“The
lost
prisoner.”

“And
the
missing
gaoler.”

“Rugen,”
the
old
man
supplied.
“An
undergaoler.
He
had
charge
of
the
third
level,
the
black
cells.”

“Tell
me
of
him,”
Jaime
had
to
say.
A
bloody
farce.
He
knew
who
Rugen
was,
even
if
Longwaters
did
not.

“Unkempt,
unshaven,
coarse
of
speech.
I
misliked
the
man,
’tis
true,
I
do
confess
it.
Rugen
was
here
when
I
first
came,
twelve
years
past.
He
held
his
appointment
from
King
Aerys.
The
man
was
seldom
here,
it
must
be
said.
I
made
note
of
it
in
my
reports,
my
lord.
I
most
suredly
did,
I
give
you
my
word
upon
it,
the
word
of
a
man
with
royal
blood.”

Mention
that
royal
blood
once
more
and
I
may
spill
some
of
it,
thought
Jaime.
“Who
saw
these
reports?”

“Certain
of
them
went
to
the
master
of
coin,
others
to
the
master
of
whisperers.
All
to
the
chief
gaoler
and
the
King’s
Justice.
It
has
always
been
so
in
the
dungeons.”
Longwaters
scratched
his
nose.
“Rugen
was
here
when
need
be,
my
lord.
That
must
be
said.
The
black
cells
are
little
used.
Before
your
lordship’s
little
brother
was
sent
down,
we
had
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
for
a
time,
and
before
him
Lord
Stark
the
traitor.
There
were
three
others,
common
men,
but
Lord
Stark
gave
them
to
the
Night’s
Watch.
I
did
not
think
it
good
to
free
those
three,
but
the
papers
were
in
proper
order.
I
made
note
of
that
in
a
report
as
well,
you
may
be
certain
of
it.”

“Tell
me
of
the
two
gaolers
who
went
to
sleep.”

“Gaolers?”
Longwaters
sniffed.
“Those
were
no
gaolers.
They
were
merely
turnkeys.
The
crown
pays
wages
for
twenty
turnkeys,
my
lord,
a
full
score,
but
during
my
time
we
have
never
had
more
than
twelve.
We
are
supposed
to
have
six
undergaolers
as
well,
two
on
each
level,
but
there
are
only
the
three.”

“You
and
two
others?”

Longwaters
sniffed
again.
“I
am
the
chief
undergaoler,
my
lord.
I
am
above
the
undergaolers.
I
am
charged
with
keeping
the
counts.
If
my
lord
would
like
to
look
over
my
books,
he
will
see
that
all
the
figures
are
exact.”
Longwaters
had
consulted
the
great
leather-bound
book
spread
out
before
him.
“At
present,
we
have
four
prisoners
on
the
first
level
and
one
on
the
second,
in
addition
to
your
lordship’s
brother.”
The
old
man
frowned.
“Who
is
fled,
to
be
sure.
’Tis
true.
I
will
strike
him
out.”
He
took
up
a
quill
and
began
to
sharpen
it.

Six
prisoners,
Jaime
thought
sourly,
while
we
pay
wages
for
twenty
turnkeys,
six
undergaolers,
a
chief
undergaoler,
a
gaoler,
and
a
King’s
Justice.
“I
want
to
question
these
two
turnkeys.”

Rennifer
Longwaters
let
up
sharpening
his
quill
and
peered
doubtfully
up
at
Jaime.
“Question
them,
my
lord?”

“You
heard
me.”

“I
did,
my
lord,
I
suredly
did,
and
yet...
my
lord
may
question
who
he
pleases,
’tis
true,
it
is
not
my
place
to
say
that
he
may
not.
But,
ser,
if
I
may
be
so
bold,
I
do
not
think
them
like
to
answer.
They
are
dead,
my
lord.”

“Dead?
By
whose
command?”

“Your
own,
I
thought,
or...
the
king’s,
mayhaps?
I
did
not
ask.
It...
it
is
not
my
place
to
question
the
Kingsguard.”

That
was
salt
for
his
wound;
Cersei
had
used
his
own
men
to
do
her
bloody
work,
them
and
her
precious
Kettleblacks.

“You
witless
fools,”
Jaime
had
snarled
at
Boros
Blount
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
later,
in
a
dungeon
that
stank
of
blood
and
death.
“What
did
you
imagine
you
were
doing?”

“No
more’n
we
was
told,
my
lord.”
Ser
Boros
was
shorter
than
Jaime,
but
heavier.
“Her
Grace
commanded
it.
Your
sister.”

Ser
Osmund
hooked
a
thumb
through
his
swordbelt.
“She
said
they
were
to
sleep
forever.
So
my
brothers
and
me,
we
saw
to
it.”

That
you
did.
One
corpse
sprawled
facedown
upon
the
table,
like
a
man
passed
out
at
a
feast,
but
it
was
a
puddle
of
blood
beneath
his
head,
not
a
puddle
of
wine.
The
second
turnkey
had
managed
to
push
back
from
the
bench
and
draw
his
dagger
before
someone
shoved
a
longsword
through
his
ribs.
His
had
been
the
longer,
messier
end.
I
told
Varys
no
one
was
to
be
harmed
in
this
escape,
Jaime
thought,
but
I
should
have
told
my
brother
and
my
sister.
“This
was
ill
done,
ser.”

Ser
Osmund
shrugged.
“They
won’t
be
missed.
I’ll
wager
they
was
part
of
it,
along
with
the
one
who’s
gone
missing.”

No,
Jaime
could
have
told
him.
Varys
dosed
their
wine
to
make
them
sleep.
“If
so,
we
might
have
coaxed
the
truth
from
them.”
...she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...
“If
I
had
a
suspicious
nature
I
might
wonder
why
you
were
in
such
haste
to
make
certain
these
two
were
never
put
to
the
question.
Did
you
need
to
silence
them
to
conceal
your
own
part
in
this?”

“Us?”
Kettleblack
choked
on
that.
“All
we
done
was
what
the
queen
commanded.
On
my
word
as
your
Sworn
Brother.”

Jaime’s
phantom
fingers
twitched
as
he
said,
“Get
Osney
and
Osfryd
down
here
and
clean
up
this
mess
you’ve
made.
And
the
next
time
my
sweet
sister
commands
you
to
kill
a
man,
come
to
me
first.
Elsewise,
stay
out
of
my
sight,
ser.”

The
words
echoed
in
his
head
in
the
dimness
of
Baelor’s
Sept.
Above
him,
all
the
windows
had
gone
black,
and
he
could
see
the
faint
light
of
distant
stars.
The
sun
had
set
for
good
and
all.
The
stench
of
death
was
growing
stronger,
despite
the
scented
candles.
The
smell
reminded
Jaime
Lannister
of
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth,
where
he
had
won
a
glorious
victory
in
the
first
days
of
the
war.
On
the
morning
after
the
battle,
the
crows
had
feasted
on
victors
and
vanquished
alike,
as
once
they
had
feasted
on
Rhaegar
Targaryen
after
the
Trident.
How
much
can
a
crown
be
worth,
when
a
crow
can
dine
upon
a
king?

There
were
crows
circling
the
seven
towers
and
great
dome
of
Baelor’s
Sept
even
now,
Jaime
suspected,
their
black
wings
beating
against
the
night
air
as
they
searched
for
a
way
inside.
Every
crow
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
should
pay
homage
to
you,
Father.
From
Castamere
to
the
Blackwater,
you
fed
them
well.
That
notion
pleased
Lord
Tywin;
his
smile
widened
further.
Bloody
hell,
he’s
grinning
like
a
bridegroom
at
his
bedding.

That
was
so
grotesque
it
made
Jaime
laugh
aloud.

The
sound
echoed
through
the
transepts
and
crypts
and
chapels,
as
if
the
dead
interred
within
the
walls
were
laughing
too.
Why
not?
This
is
more
absurd
than
a
mummer’s
farce,
me
standing
vigil
for
a
father
I
helped
to
slay,
sending
men
forth
to
capture
the
brother
I
helped
to
free...
He
had
commanded
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
to
search
the
Street
of
Silk.
“Look
under
every
bed,
you
know
how
fond
my
brother
is
of
brothels.”
The
gold
cloaks
would
find
more
of
interest
beneath
the
whores’
skirts
than
beneath
their
beds.
He
wondered
how
many
bastard
children
would
be
born
of
the
pointless
search.

Unbidden,
his
thoughts
went
to
Brienne
of
Tarth.
Stupid
stubborn
ugly
wench.
He
wondered
where
she
was.
Father,
give
her
strength.
Almost
a
prayer...
but
was
it
the
god
he
was
invoking,
the
Father
Above
whose
towering
gilded
likeness
glimmered
in
the
candlelight
across
the
sept?
Or
was
he
praying
to
the
corpse
that
lay
before
him?
Does
it
matter?
They
never
listened,
either
one.
The
Warrior
had
been
Jaime’s
god
since
he
was
old
enough
to
hold
a
sword.
Other
men
might
be
fathers,
sons,
husbands,
but
never
Jaime
Lannister,
whose
sword
was
as
golden
as
his
hair.
He
was
a
warrior,
and
that
was
all
he
would
ever
be.

I
should
tell
Cersei
the
truth,
admit
that
it
was
me
who
freed
our
little
brother
from
his
cell.
The
truth
had
worked
so
splendidly
with
Tyrion,
after
all.
I
killed
your
vile
son,
and
now
I’m
off
to
kill
your
father
too.
Jaime
could
hear
the
Imp
laughing
in
the
gloom.
He
turned
his
head
to
look,
but
the
sound
was
only
his
own
laughter
coming
back
at
him.
He
closed
his
eyes,
and
just
as
quickly
snapped
them
open.
I
must
not
sleep.
If
he
slept,
he
might
dream.
Oh,
how
Tyrion
was
sniggering...
a
lying
whore...
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack...

At
midnight
the
hinges
on
the
Father’s
Doors
gave
a
groan
as
several
hundred
septons
filed
in
for
their
devotions.
Some
were
clad
in
the
cloth-of-silver
vestments
and
crystal
coronals
that
marked
the
Most
Devout;
their
humbler
brethren
wore
their
crystals
on
thongs
about
their
necks
and
cinched
white
robes
with
seven-stranded
belts,
each
plait
a
different
color.
Through
the
Mother’s
Doors
marched
white
septas
from
their
cloister,
seven
abreast
and
singing
softly,
while
the
silent
sisters
came
single
file
down
the
Stranger’s
Steps.
Death’s
handmaidens
were
garbed
in
soft
grey,
their
faces
hooded
and
shawled
so
only
their
eyes
could
be
seen.
A
host
of
brothers
appeared
as
well,
in
robes
of
brown
and
butternut
and
dun
and
even
undyed
roughspun,
belted
with
lengths
of
hempen
rope.
Some
hung
the
iron
hammer
of
the
Smith
about
their
necks,
whilst
others
carried
begging
bowls.

None
of
the
devout
paid
Jaime
any
mind.
They
made
a
circuit
of
the
sept,
worshiping
at
each
of
the
seven
altars
to
honor
the
seven
aspects
of
the
deity.
To
each
god
they
made
sacrifice,
to
each
they
sang
a
hymn.
Sweet
and
solemn
rose
their
voices.
Jaime
closed
his
eyes
to
listen,
but
opened
them
again
when
he
began
to
sway.
I
am
more
weary
than
I
knew.

It
had
been
years
since
his
last
vigil.
And
I
was
younger
then,
a
boy
of
fifteen
years.
He
had
worn
no
armor
then,
only
a
plain
white
tunic.
The
sept
where
he’d
spent
the
night
was
not
a
third
as
large
as
any
of
the
Great
Sept’s
seven
transepts.
Jaime
had
laid
his
sword
across
the
Warrior’s
knees,
piled
his
armor
at
his
feet,
and
knelt
upon
the
rough
stone
floor
before
the
altar.
When
dawn
came
his
knees
were
raw
and
bloody.
“All
knights
must
bleed,
Jaime,”
Ser
Arthur
Dayne
had
said,
when
he
saw.
“Blood
is
the
seal
of
our
devotion.”
With
dawn
he
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder;
the
pale
blade
was
so
sharp
that
even
that
light
touch
cut
through
Jaime’s
tunic,
so
he
bled
anew.
He
never
felt
it.
A
boy
knelt;
a
knight
rose.
The
Young
Lion,
not
the
Kingslayer.

But
that
was
long
ago,
and
the
boy
was
dead.

He
could
not
have
said
when
the
devotions
ended.
Perhaps
he
slept,
still
standing.
When
the
devout
had
filed
out,
the
Great
Sept
grew
still
once
more.
The
candles
were
a
wall
of
stars
burning
in
the
darkness,
though
the
air
was
rank
with
death.
Jaime
shifted
his
grip
upon
the
golden
greatsword.
Perhaps
he
should
have
let
Ser
Loras
relieve
him
after
all.
Cersei
would
have
hated
that.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
was
still
half
a
boy,
arrogant
and
vain,
but
he
had
it
in
him
to
be
great,
to
perform
deeds
worthy
of
the
White
Book.

The
White
Book
would
be
waiting
when
this
vigil
was
done,
his
page
open
in
dumb
reproach.
I’ll
hack
the
bloody
book
to
pieces
before
I’ll
fill
it
full
of
lies.
Yet
if
he
would
not
lie,
what
could
he
write
but
truth?

A
woman
stood
before
him.

It
is
raining
again,
he
thought
when
he
saw
how
wet
she
was.
The
water
was
trickling
down
her
cloak
to
puddle
round
her
feet.
How
did
she
get
here?
I
never
heard
her
enter.
She
was
dressed
like
a
tavern
wench
in
a
heavy
roughspun
cloak,
badly
dyed
in
mottled
browns
and
fraying
at
the
hem.
A
hood
concealed
her
face,
but
he
could
see
the
candles
dancing
in
the
green
pools
of
her
eyes,
and
when
she
moved
he
knew
her.

“Cersei.”
He
spoke
slowly,
like
a
man
waking
from
a
dream,
still
wondering
where
he
was.
“What
hour
is
it?”

“The
hour
of
the
wolf.”
His
sister
lowered
her
hood,
and
made
a
face.
“The
drowned
wolf,
perhaps.”
She
smiled
for
him,
so
sweetly.
“Do
you
remember
the
first
time
I
came
to
you
like
this?
It
was
some
dismal
inn
off
Weasel
Alley,
and
I
put
on
servant’s
garb
to
get
past
Father’s
guards.”

“I
remember.
It
was
Eel
Alley.”
She
wants
something
of
me.
“Why
are
you
here,
at
this
hour?
What
would
you
have
of
me?”
His
last
word
echoed
up
and
down
the
sept,
mememememememememememe,
fading
to
a
whisper.
For
a
moment
he
dared
to
hope
that
all
she
wanted
was
the
comfort
of
his
arms.

“Speak
softly.”
Her
voice
sounded
strange...
breathless,
almost
frightened.
“Jaime,
Kevan
has
refused
me.
He
will
not
serve
as
Hand,
he...
he
knows
about
us.
He
said
as
much.”

“Refused?”
That
surprised
him.
“How
could
he
know?
He
will
have
read
what
Stannis
wrote,
but
there
is
no...”

“Tyrion
knew,”
she
reminded
him.
“Who
can
say
what
tales
that
vile
dwarf
may
have
told,
or
to
whom?
Uncle
Kevan
is
the
least
of
it.
The
High
Septon...
Tyrion
raised
him
to
the
crown,
when
the
fat
one
died.
He
may
know
as
well.”
She
moved
closer.
“You
must
be
Tommen’s
Hand.
I
do
not
trust
Mace
Tyrell.
What
if
he
had
a
hand
in
Father’s
death?
He
may
have
been
conspiring
with
Tyrion.
The
Imp
could
be
on
his
way
to
Highgarden...”

“He’s
not.”

“Be
my
Hand,”
she
pleaded,
“and
we’ll
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms
together,
like
a
king
and
his
queen.”

“You
were
Robert’s
queen.
And
yet
you
won’t
be
mine.”

“I
would,
if
I
dared.
But
our
son—”

“Tommen
is
no
son
of
mine,
no
more
than
Joffrey
was.”
His
voice
was
hard.
“You
made
them
Robert’s
too.”

His
sister
flinched.
“You
swore
that
you
would
always
love
me.
It
is
not
loving
to
make
me
beg.”

Jaime
could
smell
the
fear
on
her,
even
through
the
rank
stench
of
the
corpse.
He
wanted
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her,
to
bury
his
face
in
her
golden
curls
and
promise
her
that
no
one
would
ever
hurt
her...
not
here,
he
thought,
not
here
in
front
of
the
gods,
and
Father.
“No,”
he
said.
“I
cannot.
Will
not.”

“I
need
you.
I
need
my
other
half.”
He
could
hear
the
rain
pattering
against
the
windows
high
above.
“You
are
me,
I
am
you.
I
need
you
with
me.
In
me.
Please,
Jaime.
Please.”

Jaime
looked
to
make
certain
Lord
Tywin
was
not
rising
from
his
bier
in
wrath,
but
his
father
lay
still
and
cold,
rotting.
“I
was
made
for
a
battlefield,
not
a
council
chamber.
And
now
it
may
be
that
I
am
unfit
even
for
that.”

Cersei
wiped
her
tears
away
on
a
ragged
brown
sleeve.
“Very
well.
If
it
is
battlefields
you
want,
battlefields
I
shall
give
you.”
She
jerked
her
hood
up
angrily.
“I
was
a
fool
to
come.
I
was
a
fool
ever
to
love
you.”
Her
footsteps
echoed
loudly
in
the
quiet,
and
left
damp
splotches
on
the
marble
floor.

Dawn
caught
Jaime
almost
unawares.
As
the
glass
in
the
dome
began
to
lighten,
suddenly
there
were
rainbows
shimmering
off
the
walls
and
floors
and
pillars,
bathing
Lord
Tywin’s
corpse
in
a
haze
of
many-colored
light.
The
King’s
Hand
was
rotting
visibly.
His
face
had
taken
on
a
greenish
tinge,
and
his
eyes
were
deeply
sunken,
two
black
pits.
Fissures
had
opened
in
his
cheeks,
and
a
foul
white
fluid
was
seeping
through
the
joints
of
his
splendid
gold-and-crimson
armor
to
pool
beneath
his
body.

The
septons
were
the
first
to
see,
when
they
returned
for
their
dawn
devotions.
They
sang
their
songs
and
prayed
their
prayers
and
wrinkled
up
their
noses,
and
one
of
the
Most
Devout
grew
so
faint
he
had
to
be
helped
from
the
sept.
Shortly
after,
a
flock
of
novices
came
swinging
censers,
and
the
air
grew
so
thick
with
incense
that
the
bier
seemed
cloaked
in
smoke.
All
the
rainbows
vanished
in
that
perfumed
mist,
yet
the
stench
persisted,
a
sweet
rotten
smell
that
made
Jaime
want
to
gag.

When
the
doors
were
opened
the
Tyrells
were
amongst
the
first
to
enter,
as
befit
their
rank.
Margaery
had
brought
a
great
bouquet
of
golden
roses.
She
placed
them
ostentatiously
at
the
foot
of
Lord
Tywin’s
bier
but
kept
one
back
and
held
it
beneath
her
nose
as
she
took
her
seat.
So
the
girl
is
as
clever
as
she
is
pretty.
Tommen
could
do
a
deal
worse
for
a
queen.
Others
have.
Margaery’s
ladies
followed
her
example.

Cersei
waited
until
the
rest
were
in
their
places
to
make
her
entrance,
with
Tommen
at
her
side.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
paced
beside
them
in
his
white
enamel
plate
and
white
wool
cloak.

“...she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...”

Jaime
had
seen
Kettleblack
naked
in
the
bathhouse,
had
seen
the
black
hair
on
his
chest,
and
the
coarser
thatch
between
his
legs.
He
pictured
that
chest
pressed
against
his
sister’s,
that
hair
scratching
the
soft
skin
of
her
breasts.
She
would
not
do
that.
The
Imp
lied.
Spun
gold
and
black
wire
tangled,
sweaty.
Kettleblack’s
narrow
cheeks
clenching
each
time
he
thrust.
Jaime
could
hear
his
sister
moan.
No.
A
lie.

Red-eyed
and
pale,
Cersei
climbed
the
steps
to
kneel
above
their
father,
drawing
Tommen
down
beside
her.
The
boy
recoiled
at
the
sight,
but
his
mother
seized
his
wrist
before
he
could
pull
away.
“Pray,”
she
whispered,
and
Tommen
tried.
But
he
was
only
eight
and
Lord
Tywin
was
a
horror.
One
desperate
breath
of
air,
then
the
king
began
to
sob.
“Stop
that!”
Cersei
said.
Tommen
turned
his
head
and
doubled
over,
retching.
His
crown
fell
off
and
rolled
across
the
marble
floor.
His
mother
pulled
back
in
disgust,
and
all
at
once
the
king
was
running
for
the
doors,
as
fast
as
his
eight-year-old
legs
could
carry
him.

“Ser
Osmund,
relieve
me,”
Jaime
said
sharply,
as
Kettleblack
turned
to
chase
the
crown.
He
handed
the
man
the
golden
sword
and
went
after
his
king.
In
the
Hall
of
Lamps
he
caught
him,
beneath
the
eyes
of
two
dozen
startled
septas.
“I’m
sorry,”
Tommen
wept.
“I
will
do
better
on
the
morrow.
Mother
says
a
king
must
show
the
way,
but
the
smell
made
me
sick.”

This
will
not
do.
Too
many
eager
ears
and
watching
eyes.
“Best
we
go
outside,
Your
Grace.”
Jaime
led
the
boy
out
to
where
the
air
was
as
fresh
and
clean
as
King’s
Landing
ever
got.
Twoscore
gold
cloaks
had
been
posted
around
the
plaza
to
guard
the
horses
and
the
litters.
He
took
the
king
off
to
the
side,
well
away
from
everyone,
and
sat
him
down
upon
the
marble
steps.
“I
wasn’t
scared,”
the
boy
insisted.
“The
smell
made
me
sick.
Didn’t
it
make
you
sick?
How
could
you
bear
it,
Uncle,
ser?”

I
have
smelled
my
own
hand
rotting,
when
Vargo
Hoat
made
me
wear
it
for
a
pendant.
“A
man
can
bear
most
anything,
if
he
must,”
Jaime
told
his
son.
I
have
smelled
a
man
roasting,
as
King
Aerys
cooked
him
in
his
own
armor.
“The
world
is
full
of
horrors,
Tommen.
You
can
fight
them,
or
laugh
at
them,
or
look
without
seeing...
go
away
inside.”

Tommen
considered
that.
“I...
I
used
to
go
away
inside
sometimes,”
he
confessed,
“when
Joffy...”

“Joffrey.”
Cersei
stood
over
them,
the
wind
whipping
her
skirts
around
her
legs.
“Your
brother’s
name
was
Joffrey.
He
would
never
have
shamed
me
so.”

“I
never
meant
to.
I
wasn’t
frightened,
Mother.
It
was
only
that
your
lord
father
smelled
so
bad...”

“Do
you
think
he
smelled
any
sweeter
to
me?
I
have
a
nose
too.”
She
caught
his
ear
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet.
“Lord
Tyrell
has
a
nose.
Did
you
see
him
retching
in
the
holy
sept?
Did
you
see
Lady
Margaery
bawling
like
a
baby?”

Jaime
got
to
his
feet.
“Cersei,
enough.”

Her
nostrils
flared.
“Ser?
Why
are
you
here?
You
swore
to
stand
vigil
over
Father
until
the
wake
was
done,
as
I
recall.”

“It
is
done.
Go
look
at
him.”

“No.
Seven
days
and
seven
nights,
you
said.
Surely
the
Lord
Commander
remembers
how
to
count
to
seven.
Take
the
number
of
your
fingers,
then
add
two.”

Others
had
begun
to
stream
out
onto
the
plaza,
fleeing
the
noxious
odors
in
the
sept.
“Cersei,
keep
your
voice
down,”
Jaime
warned.
“Lord
Tyrell
is
approaching.”

That
reached
her.
The
queen
drew
Tommen
to
her
side.
Mace
Tyrell
bowed
before
them.
“His
Grace
is
not
unwell,
I
hope?”

“The
king
was
overwhelmed
by
grief,”
said
Cersei.

“As
are
we
all.
If
there
is
aught
that
I
can
do...”

High
above,
a
crow
screamed
loudly.
He
was
perched
on
the
statue
of
King
Baelor,
shitting
on
his
holy
head.
“There
is
much
and
more
you
can
do
for
Tommen,
my
lord,”
Jaime
said.
“Perhaps
you
would
do
Her
Grace
the
honor
of
supping
with
her,
after
the
evening
services?”

Cersei
threw
him
a
withering
look,
but
for
once
she
had
the
sense
to
bite
her
tongue.

“Sup?”
Tyrell
seemed
taken
aback.
“I
suppose...
of
course,
we
should
be
honored.
My
lady
wife
and
I.”

The
queen
forced
a
smile
and
made
pleasant
noises.
But
when
Tyrell
had
taken
his
leave
and
Tommen
had
been
sent
off
with
Ser
Addam
Marbrand,
she
turned
on
Jaime
angrily.
“Are
you
drunk
or
dreaming,
ser?
Pray
tell,
why
am
I
having
supper
with
that
grasping
fool
and
his
puerile
wife?”
A
gust
of
wind
stirred
her
golden
hair.
“I
will
not
name
him
Hand,
if
that’s
what—”

“You
need
Tyrell,”
Jaime
broke
in,
“but
not
here.
Ask
him
to
capture
Storm’s
End
for
Tommen.
Flatter
him,
and
tell
him
you
need
him
in
the
field,
to
replace
Father.
Mace
fancies
himself
a
mighty
warrior.
Either
he
will
deliver
Storm’s
End
to
you,
or
he
will
muck
it
up
and
look
a
fool.
Either
way,
you
win.”

“Storm’s
End?”
Cersei
looked
thoughtful.
“Yes,
but...
Lord
Tyrell
has
made
it
tediously
plain
that
he
will
not
leave
King’s
Landing
till
Tommen
marries
Margaery.”

Jaime
sighed.
“Then
let
them
wed.
It
will
be
years
before
Tommen
is
old
enough
to
consummate
the
marriage.
And
until
he
does,
the
union
can
always
be
set
aside.
Give
Tyrell
his
wedding
and
send
him
off
to
play
at
war.”

A
wary
smile
crept
across
his
sister’s
face.
“Even
sieges
have
their
dangers,”
she
murmured.
“Why,
our
Lord
of
Highgarden
might
even
lose
his
life
in
such
a
venture.”

“There
is
that
risk,”
conceded
Jaime.
“Especially
if
his
patience
runs
thin
this
time,
and
he
elects
to
storm
the
gate.”

Cersei
gave
him
a
lingering
look.
“You
know,”
she
said,
“for
a
moment
you
sounded
quite
like
Father.”





BRIENNE

The
gates
of
Duskendale
were
closed
and
barred.
Through
the
predawn
gloom
the
town
walls
shimmered
palely.
On
their
ramparts,
wisps
of
fog
moved
like
ghostly
sentinels.
A
dozen
wayns
and
oxcarts
had
drawn
up
outside
the
gates,
waiting
for
the
sun
to
rise.
Brienne
took
her
place
behind
some
turnips.
Her
calves
ached,
and
it
felt
good
to
dismount
and
stretch
her
legs.
Before
long
another
wayn
came
rumbling
from
the
woods.
By
the
time
the
sky
began
to
lighten,
the
queue
stretched
back
a
quarter
mile.

The
farm
folk
gave
her
curious
glances,
but
no
one
spoke
to
her.
It
is
for
me
to
talk
to
them,
Brienne
told
herself,
but
she
had
always
found
it
hard
to
speak
with
strangers.
Even
as
a
girl
she
had
been
shy.
Long
years
of
scorn
had
only
made
her
shyer.
I
must
ask
after
Sansa.
How
else
will
I
find
her?
She
cleared
her
throat.
“Goodwife,”
she
said
to
the
woman
on
the
turnip
cart,
“perhaps
you
saw
my
sister
on
the
road?
A
young
maid,
three-and-ten
and
fair
of
face,
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
She
may
be
riding
with
a
drunken
knight.”

The
woman
shook
her
head,
but
her
husband
said,
“Then
she’s
no
maid,
I’ll
wager.
Does
the
poor
girl
have
a
name?”

Brienne’s
head
was
empty.
I
should
have
made
up
some
name
for
her.
Any
name
would
do,
but
none
came
to
her.

“No
name?
Well,
the
roads
are
full
of
nameless
girls.”

“The
lichyard’s
even
fuller,”
said
his
wife.

As
dawn
broke,
guardsmen
appeared
on
the
parapets.
The
farmers
climbed
onto
their
wagons
and
shook
the
reins.
Brienne
mounted
as
well
and
took
a
glance
behind
her.
Most
of
the
queue
waiting
to
enter
Duskendale
were
farm
folk
with
loads
of
fruits
and
vegetables
to
sell.
A
pair
of
wealthy
townsmen
sat
on
well-bred
palfreys
a
dozen
places
behind
her,
and
farther
back
she
spied
a
skinny
boy
on
a
piebald
rounsey.
There
was
no
sign
of
the
two
knights,
nor
Ser
Shadrich
the
Mad
Mouse.

The
guards
were
waving
through
the
wayns
with
scarce
a
look,
but
when
Brienne
reached
the
gate
she
gave
them
pause.
“Halt,
you!”
the
captain
cried.
A
pair
of
men
in
chainmail
hauberks
crossed
their
spears
to
bar
her
way.
“State
your
purpose
here.”

“I
seek
the
Lord
of
Duskendale,
or
his
maester.”

The
captain’s
eyes
lingered
on
her
shield.
“The
black
bat
of
Lothston.
Those
are
arms
of
ill
repute.”

“They
are
not
mine.
I
mean
to
have
the
shield
repainted.”

“Aye?”
The
captain
rubbed
his
stubbled
chin.
“My
sister
does
such
work,
as
it
happens.
You’ll
find
her
at
the
house
with
the
painted
doors,
across
from
the
Seven
Swords.”
He
gestured
to
the
guards.
“Let
her
pass,
lads.
It’s
a
wench.”

The
gatehouse
opened
on
a
market
square,
where
those
who
had
entered
before
her
were
unloading
to
hawk
their
turnips,
yellow
onions,
and
sacks
of
barleycorn.
Others
were
selling
arms
and
armor,
and
very
cheaply
to
judge
from
the
prices
they
shouted
out
as
she
rode
by.
The
looters
come
with
the
carrion
crows
after
every
battle.
Brienne
walked
her
horse
past
mail
shirts
still
caked
with
brown
blood,
dinted
helms,
notched
longswords.
There
was
clothing
to
be
had
as
well:
leather
boots,
fur
cloaks,
stained
surcoats
with
suspicious
rents.
She
knew
many
of
the
badges.
The
mailed
fist,
the
moose,
the
white
sun,
the
double-bladed
axe,
all
those
were
northern
sigils.
Tarly
men
had
perished
here
as
well,
though,
and
many
from
the
stormlands.
She
saw
red
and
green
apples,
a
shield
that
bore
the
three
thunderbolts
of
Leygood,
horse
trappings
patterned
with
the
ants
of
Ambrose.
Lord
Tarly’s
own
striding
huntsman
appeared
on
many
a
badge
and
brooch
and
doublet.
Friend
or
foe,
the
crows
care
not.

There
were
pine
and
linden
shields
to
be
had
for
pennies,
but
Brienne
rode
past
them.
She
meant
to
keep
the
heavy
oaken
shield
Jaime
had
given
her,
the
one
he’d
borne
himself
from
Harrenhal
to
King’s
Landing.
A
pine
shield
had
its
advantages.
It
was
lighter,
and
therefore
easier
to
bear,
and
the
soft
wood
was
more
like
to
trap
a
foeman’s
axe
or
sword.
But
oak
gave
more
protection,
if
you
were
strong
enough
to
bear
its
weight.

Duskendale
was
built
around
its
harbor.
North
of
town
the
chalk
cliffs
rose;
to
the
south
a
rocky
headland
shielded
the
ships
at
anchor
from
storms
coming
up
the
narrow
sea.
The
castle
overlooked
the
port,
its
square
keep
and
big
drum
towers
visible
from
every
part
of
town.
In
the
crowded
cobbled
streets,
it
was
easier
to
walk
than
ride,
so
Brienne
put
her
mare
up
in
a
stable
and
continued
on
afoot,
with
her
shield
slung
across
her
back
and
her
bedroll
tucked
up
beneath
one
arm.

The
captain’s
sister
was
not
hard
to
find.
The
Seven
Swords
was
the
largest
inn
in
town,
a
four-story
structure
that
towered
over
its
neighbors,
and
the
double
doors
on
the
house
across
the
way
were
painted
gorgeously.
They
showed
a
castle
in
an
autumn
wood,
the
trees
done
up
in
shades
of
gold
and
russet.
Ivy
crawled
up
the
trunks
of
ancient
oaks,
and
even
the
acorns
had
been
done
with
loving
care.
When
Brienne
peered
more
closely,
she
saw
creatures
in
the
foliage:
a
sly
red
fox,
two
sparrows
on
a
branch,
and
behind
those
leaves
the
shadow
of
a
boar.

“Your
door
is
very
pretty,”
she
told
the
dark-haired
woman
who
answered
when
she
knocked.
“What
castle
is
that
meant
to
be?”

“All
castles,”
said
the
captain’s
sister.
“The
only
one
I
know
is
the
Dun
Fort
by
the
harbor.
I
made
t’other
in
my
head,
what
a
castle
ought
to
look
like.
I
never
seen
a
dragon
neither,
nor
a
griffin,
nor
a
unicorn.”
She
had
a
cheerful
manner,
but
when
Brienne
showed
her
the
shield
her
face
went
dark.
“My
old
ma
used
to
say
that
giant
bats
flew
out
from
Harrenhal
on
moonless
nights,
to
carry
bad
children
to
Mad
Danelle
for
her
cookpots.
Sometimes
I’d
hear
them
scrabbling
at
the
shutters.”
She
sucked
her
teeth
a
moment,
thoughtful.
“What
goes
in
its
place?”

The
arms
of
Tarth
were
quartered
rose
and
azure,
and
bore
a
yellow
sun
and
crescent
moon.
But
so
long
as
men
believed
her
to
be
a
murderess,
Brienne
dare
not
carry
them.
“Your
door
reminded
me
of
an
old
shield
I
once
saw
in
my
father’s
armory.”
She
described
the
arms
as
best
she
could
recall
them.

The
woman
nodded.
“I
can
paint
it
straightaway,
but
the
paint
will
need
to
dry.
Take
a
room
at
the
Seven
Swords,
if
it
please
you.
I’ll
bring
the
shield
to
you
by
morning.”

Brienne
had
not
meant
to
overnight
in
Duskendale,
but
it
might
be
for
the
best.
She
did
not
know
if
the
lord
of
the
castle
was
in
residence,
or
whether
he
would
consent
to
see
her.
She
thanked
the
painter
and
crossed
the
cobblestones
to
the
inn.
Above
its
door,
seven
wooden
swords
swung
beneath
an
iron
spike.
The
whitewash
that
covered
them
was
cracked
and
peeling,
but
Brienne
knew
their
meaning.
They
stood
for
the
seven
sons
of
Darklyn
who
had
worn
the
white
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard.
No
other
house
in
all
the
realm
could
claim
as
many.
They
were
the
glory
of
their
House.
And
now
they
are
a
sign
above
an
inn.
She
pushed
into
the
common
room
and
asked
the
innkeep
for
a
room
and
a
bath.

He
put
her
on
the
second
floor,
and
a
woman
with
a
liver-colored
birthmark
on
her
face
brought
up
a
wooden
tub,
and
then
the
water,
pail
by
pail.
“Do
any
Darklyns
remain
in
Duskendale?”
Brienne
asked
as
she
climbed
into
the
tub.

“Well,
there’s
Darkes,
I’m
one
myself.
My
husband
says
I
was
Darke
before
we
wed,
and
darker
afterward.”
She
laughed.
“Can’t
throw
a
stone
in
Duskendale
without
you
hit
some
Darke
or
Darkwood
or
Dargood,
but
the
lordly
Darklyns
are
all
gone.
Lord
Denys
was
the
last
o’
them,
the
sweet
young
fool.
Did
you
know
the
Darklyns
were
kings
in
Duskendale
before
the
Andals
come?
You’d
never
know
t’look
at
me,
but
I
got
me
royal
blood.
Can
you
see
it?
‘Your
Grace,
another
cup
of
ale,’
I
ought
to
make
them
say.
‘Your
Grace,
the
chamber
pot
needs
emptying,
and
fetch
in
some
fresh
faggots,
Your
Bloody
Grace,
the
fire’s
going
out.’”
She
laughed
again
and
shook
the
last
drops
from
the
pail.
“Well,
there
you
are.
Is
that
water
hot
enough
for
you?”

“It
will
serve.”
The
water
was
lukewarm.

“I’d
bring
up
more,
but
it’d
just
slop
over.
A
girl
the
size
o’
you,
you
fill
a
tub.”

Only
a
cramped
small
tub
like
this
one.
At
Harrenhal
the
tubs
had
been
huge,
and
made
of
stone.
The
bathhouse
had
been
thick
with
the
steam
rising
off
the
water,
and
Jaime
had
come
walking
through
that
mist
naked
as
his
name
day,
looking
half
a
corpse
and
half
a
god.
He
climbed
into
the
tub
with
me,
she
remembered,
blushing.
She
seized
a
chunk
of
hard
lye
soap
and
scrubbed
under
her
arms,
trying
to
call
up
Renly’s
face
again.

By
the
time
the
water
had
gone
cold,
Brienne
was
as
clean
as
she
was
like
to
get.
She
put
on
the
same
clothes
she
had
taken
off
and
girded
her
swordbelt
tight
around
her
hips,
but
her
mail
and
helm
she
left
behind,
so
as
not
to
seem
so
threatening
at
the
Dun
Fort.
It
felt
good
to
stretch
her
legs.
The
guards
at
the
castle
gates
wore
leather
jacks
with
a
badge
that
showed
crossed
warhammers
upon
a
white
saltire.
“I
would
speak
with
your
lord,”
Brienne
told
them.

One
laughed.
“Best
shout
out
loud,
then.”

“Lord
Rykker
rode
to
Maidenpool
with
Randyll
Tarly,”
the
other
said.
“He
left
Ser
Rufus
Leek
as
castellan,
to
look
after
Lady
Rykker
and
the
young
ones.”

It
was
to
Leek
that
they
escorted
her.
Ser
Rufus
was
a
short,
stout
greybeard
whose
left
leg
ended
in
a
stump.
“You
will
forgive
me
if
I
do
not
rise,”
he
said.
Brienne
offered
him
her
letter,
but
Leek
could
not
read,
so
he
sent
her
to
the
maester,
a
bald
man
with
a
freckled
scalp
and
a
stiff
red
mustache.

When
he
heard
the
name
Hollard,
the
maester
frowned
with
irritation.
“How
often
must
I
sing
this
song?”
Her
face
must
have
given
her
away.
“Did
you
think
you
were
the
first
to
come
seeking
after
Dontos?
More
like
the
twenty-first.
The
gold
cloaks
were
here
within
days
of
the
king’s
murder,
with
Lord
Tywin’s
warrant.
And
what
do
you
have,
pray?”

Brienne
showed
him
the
letter,
with
Tommen’s
seal
and
childish
signature.
The
maester
hmmmmed
and
hrrrred,
picked
at
the
wax,
and
finally
gave
it
back.
“It
seems
in
order.”
He
climbed
onto
a
stool
and
gestured
Brienne
to
another.
“I
never
knew
Ser
Dontos.
He
was
a
boy
when
he
left
Duskendale.
The
Hollards
were
a
noble
House
once,
’tis
true.
You
know
their
arms?
Barry
red
and
pink,
with
three
golden
crowns
upon
a
blue
chief.
The
Darklyns
were
petty
kings
during
the
Age
of
Heroes,
and
three
took
Hollard
wives.
Later
their
little
realm
was
swallowed
up
by
larger
kingdoms,
yet
the
Darklyns
endured
and
the
Hollards
served
them...
aye,
even
in
defiance.
You
know
of
that?”

“A
little.”
Her
own
maester
used
to
say
that
it
was
the
Defiance
of
Duskendale
that
had
driven
King
Aerys
mad.

“In
Duskendale
they
love
Lord
Denys
still,
despite
the
woe
he
brought
them.
’Tis
Lady
Serala
that
they
blame,
his
Myrish
wife.
The
Lace
Serpent,
she
is
called.
If
Lord
Darklyn
had
only
wed
a
Staunton
or
a
Stokeworth...
well,
you
know
how
smallfolk
will
go
on.
The
Lace
Serpent
filled
her
husband’s
ear
with
Myrish
poison,
they
say,
until
Lord
Denys
rose
against
his
king
and
took
him
captive.
In
the
taking,
his
master-at-arms
Ser
Symon
Hollard
cut
down
Ser
Gwayne
Gaunt
of
the
Kingsguard.
For
half
a
year
Aerys
was
held
within
these
very
walls,
whilst
the
King’s
Hand
sat
outside
Duskendale
with
a
mighty
host.
Lord
Tywin
had
sufficient
strength
to
storm
the
town
any
time
he
wished,
but
Lord
Denys
sent
word
that
at
the
first
sign
of
assault
he’d
kill
the
king.”

Brienne
remembered
what
came
next.
“The
king
was
rescued,”
she
said.
“Barristan
the
Bold
brought
him
out.”

“He
did,”
the
maester
said.
“Once
Lord
Denys
lost
his
hostage,
he
opened
his
gates
and
ended
his
defiance
rather
than
let
Lord
Tywin
take
the
town.
He
bent
the
knee
and
begged
for
mercy,
but
the
king
was
not
of
a
forgiving
mind.
Lord
Denys
lost
his
head,
as
did
his
brothers
and
his
sister,
uncles,
cousins,
all
the
lordly
Darklyns.
The
Lace
Serpent
was
burned
alive,
poor
woman,
though
her
tongue
was
torn
out
first,
and
her
female
parts,
with
which
it
was
said
that
she
had
enslaved
her
lord.
Half
of
Duskendale
will
still
tell
you
that
Aerys
was
too
kind
to
her.”

“And
the
Hollards?”

“Attainted
and
destroyed,”
said
the
maester.
“I
was
forging
my
chain
at
the
Citadel
when
this
happened,
but
I
have
read
the
accounts
of
their
trials
and
punishments.
Ser
Jon
Hollard
the
Steward
was
wed
to
Lord
Denys’s
sister
and
died
with
his
wife,
as
did
their
young
son,
who
was
half-Darklyn.
Robin
Hollard
was
a
squire,
and
when
the
king
was
seized
he
danced
around
him
and
pulled
his
beard.
He
died
upon
the
rack.
Ser
Symon
Hollard
was
slain
by
Ser
Barristan
during
the
king’s
escape.
The
Hollard
lands
were
taken,
their
castle
torn
down,
their
villages
put
to
the
torch.
As
with
the
Darklyns,
House
Hollard
was
extinguished.”

“Save
for
Dontos.”

“True
enough.
Young
Dontos
was
the
son
of
Ser
Steffon
Hollard,
the
twin
brother
of
Ser
Symon,
who
had
died
of
a
fever
some
years
before
and
had
no
part
in
the
Defiance.
Aerys
would
have
taken
the
boy’s
head
off
nonetheless,
but
Ser
Barristan
asked
that
his
life
be
spared.
The
king
could
not
refuse
the
man
who’d
saved
him,
so
Dontos
was
taken
to
King’s
Landing
as
a
squire.
To
my
knowledge
he
never
returned
to
Duskendale,
and
why
should
he?
He
held
no
lands
here,
had
neither
kin
nor
castle.
If
Dontos
and
this
northern
girl
helped
murder
our
sweet
king,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
want
to
put
as
many
leagues
as
they
could
betwixt
themselves
and
justice.
Look
for
them
in
Oldtown,
if
you
must,
or
across
the
narrow
sea.
Look
for
them
in
Dorne,
or
on
the
Wall.
Look
elsewhere.”
He
rose.
“I
hear
my
ravens
calling.
You
will
forgive
me
if
I
bid
you
good
morrow.”

The
walk
back
to
the
inn
seemed
longer
than
the
walk
to
the
Dun
Fort,
though
perhaps
that
was
only
her
mood.
She
would
not
find
Sansa
Stark
in
Duskendale,
that
seemed
plain.
If
Ser
Dontos
had
taken
her
to
Oldtown
or
across
the
narrow
sea,
as
the
maester
seemed
to
think,
Brienne’s
quest
was
hopeless.
What
was
there
for
her
in
Oldtown?
she
asked
herself.
The
maester
never
knew
her,
no
more
than
he
knew
Hollard.
She
would
not
have
gone
to
strangers.

In
King’s
Landing,
Brienne
had
found
one
of
Sansa’s
former
maids
doing
washing
in
a
brothel.
“I
served
with
Lord
Renly
before
m’lady
Sansa,
and
both
turned
traitor,”
the
woman
Brella
complained
bitterly.
“No
lord
will
touch
me
now,
so
I
have
to
wash
for
whores.”
But
when
Brienne
asked
about
Sansa,
she
said,
“I’ll
tell
you
what
I
told
Lord
Tywin.
That
girl
was
always
praying.
She’d
go
to
sept
and
light
her
candles
like
a
proper
lady,
but
near
every
night
she
went
off
to
the
godswood.
She’s
gone
back
north,
she
has.
That’s
where
her
gods
are.”

The
north
was
huge,
though,
and
Brienne
had
no
notion
which
of
her
father’s
bannermen
Sansa
might
have
been
most
inclined
to
trust.
Or
would
she
seek
her
own
blood
instead?
Though
all
of
her
siblings
had
been
slain,
Brienne
knew
that
Sansa
still
had
an
uncle
and
a
bastard
half
brother
on
the
Wall,
serving
in
the
Night’s
Watch.
Another
uncle,
Edmure
Tully,
was
a
captive
at
the
Twins,
but
his
uncle
Ser
Brynden
still
held
Riverrun.
And
Lady
Catelyn’s
younger
sister
ruled
the
Vale.
Blood
calls
to
blood.
Sansa
might
well
have
run
to
one
of
them.
Which
one,
though?

The
Wall
was
too
far,
surely,
and
a
bleak
and
bitter
place
besides.
And
to
reach
Riverrun
the
girl
would
need
to
cross
the
war-torn
riverlands
and
pass
through
the
Lannister
siege
lines.
The
Eyrie
would
be
simpler,
and
Lady
Lysa
would
surely
welcome
her
sister’s
daughter...

Ahead,
the
alley
bent.
Somehow
Brienne
had
taken
a
wrong
turn.
She
found
herself
in
a
dead
end,
a
small
muddy
yard
where
three
pigs
were
rooting
round
a
low
stone
well.
One
squealed
at
the
sight
of
her,
and
an
old
woman
drawing
water
looked
her
up
and
down
suspiciously.
“What
would
you
be
wanting?”

“I
was
looking
for
the
Seven
Swords.”

“Back
the
way
you
come.
Left
at
the
sept.”

“I
thank
you.”
Brienne
turned
to
retrace
her
steps,
and
walked
headfirst
into
someone
hurrying
round
the
bend.
The
collision
knocked
him
off
his
feet,
and
he
landed
on
his
arse
in
the
mud.
“Pardons,”
she
murmured.
He
was
only
a
boy;
a
scrawny
lad
with
straight,
thin
hair
and
a
sty
beneath
one
eye.
“Are
you
hurt?”
She
offered
a
hand
to
help
him
up,
but
the
boy
squirmed
back
away
from
her
on
heels
and
elbows.
He
could
not
have
been
more
than
ten
or
twelve,
though
he
wore
a
chainmail
byrnie
and
had
a
longsword
in
a
leather
sheath
slung
across
his
back.
“Do
I
know
you?”
Brienne
asked.
His
face
seemed
vaguely
familiar,
though
she
could
not
think
from
where.

“No.
You
don’t.
You
never...”
He
scrambled
to
his
feet.
“F-f-forgive
me.
My
lady.
I
wasn’t
looking.
I
mean,
I
was,
but
down.
I
was
looking
down.
At
my
feet.”
The
boy
took
to
his
heels,
plunging
headlong
back
the
way
he’d
come.

Something
about
him
roused
all
of
Brienne’s
suspicions,
but
she
was
not
about
to
chase
him
through
the
streets
of
Duskendale.
Outside
the
gates
this
morning,
that
was
where
I
saw
him,
she
realized.
He
was
riding
a
piebald
rounsey.
And
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
seen
him
somewhere
else
as
well,
but
where?

By
the
time
Brienne
found
the
Seven
Swords
again,
the
common
room
was
crowded.
Four
septas
sat
closest
to
the
fire,
in
robes
stained
and
dusty
from
the
road.
Elsewhere
locals
filled
the
benches,
sopping
up
bowls
of
hot
crab
stew
with
chunks
of
bread.
The
smell
made
her
stomach
rumble,
but
she
saw
no
empty
seats.
Then
a
voice
behind
her
said,
“M’lady,
here,
have
my
place.”
Not
until
he
hopped
off
the
bench
did
Brienne
realize
that
the
speaker
was
a
dwarf.
The
little
man
was
not
quite
five
feet
tall.
His
nose
was
veined
and
bulbous,
his
teeth
red
from
sourleaf,
and
he
was
dressed
in
the
brown
roughspun
robes
of
a
holy
brother,
with
the
iron
hammer
of
the
Smith
dangling
down
about
his
thick
neck.

“Keep
your
seat,”
she
said.
“I
can
stand
as
well
as
you.”

“Aye,
but
my
head
is
not
so
apt
to
knock
upon
the
ceiling.”
The
dwarf’s
speech
was
coarse
but
courteous.
Brienne
could
see
the
crown
of
his
scalp
where
he
had
shaved
it.
Many
holy
brothers
wore
such
tonsures.
Septa
Roelle
once
told
her
that
it
was
meant
to
show
that
they
had
nothing
to
hide
from
the
Father.
“Can’t
the
Father
see
through
hair?”
Brienne
had
asked.
A
stupid
thing
to
say.
She
had
been
a
slow
child;
Septa
Roelle
often
told
her
so.
She
felt
near
as
stupid
now,
so
she
took
the
little
man’s
place
at
the
end
of
the
bench,
signaled
for
stew,
and
turned
to
thank
the
dwarf.
“Do
you
serve
some
holy
house
in
Duskendale,
brother?”

“’Twas
nearer
Maidenpool,
m’lady,
but
the
wolves
burned
us
out,”
the
man
replied,
gnawing
on
a
heel
of
bread.
“We
rebuilt
as
best
we
could,
until
some
sellswords
come.
I
could
not
say
whose
men
they
were,
but
they
took
our
pigs
and
killed
the
brothers.
I
squeezed
inside
a
hollow
log
and
hid,
but
t’others
were
too
big.
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
bury
them
all,
but
the
Smith,
he
gave
me
strength.
When
that
was
done
I
dug
up
a
few
coins
the
elder
brother
had
hid
by
and
set
off
by
myself.”

“I
met
some
other
brothers
going
to
King’s
Landing.”

“Aye,
there’s
hundreds
on
the
roads.
Not
only
brothers.
Septons
too,
and
smallfolk.
Sparrows
all.
Might
be
I’m
a
sparrow
too.
The
Smith,
he
made
me
small
enough.”
He
chuckled.
“And
what’s
your
sad
tale,
m’lady?”

“I
am
looking
for
my
sister.
She’s
highborn,
only
three-and-ten,
a
pretty
maid
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
You
may
have
seen
her
traveling
with
a
man.
A
knight,
perhaps
a
fool.
There’s
gold
for
the
man
who
helps
me
find
her.”

“Gold?”
The
brother
gave
her
a
red
smile.
“A
bowl
of
that
crab
stew
would
be
enough
reward
for
me,
but
I
fear
I
cannot
help
you.
Fools
I’ve
met,
and
plenty,
but
not
so
many
pretty
maids.”
He
cocked
his
head
and
thought
a
moment.
“There
was
a
fool
at
Maidenpool,
now
that
I
think
of
it.
He
was
clad
in
rags
and
dirt,
as
near
as
I
could
tell,
but
under
the
dirt
was
motley.”

Did
Dontos
Hollard
wear
motley?
No
one
had
told
Brienne
that
he
did...
but
no
one
had
ever
said
he
didn’t,
either.
Why
would
the
man
be
in
rags,
though?
Had
some
misfortune
overtaken
him
and
Sansa
after
they
fled
King’s
Landing?
That
could
well
be,
with
the
roads
so
dangerous.
It
might
not
have
been
him
at
all.
“Did
this
fool
have
a
red
nose,
full
of
broken
veins?”

“I
could
not
swear
to
that.
I
confess,
I
paid
him
little
heed.
I’d
gone
to
Maidenpool
after
burying
my
brothers,
thinking
that
I
might
find
a
ship
to
take
me
to
King’s
Landing.
I
first
glimpsed
the
fool
down
by
the
docks.
He
had
a
furtive
air
to
him
and
took
care
to
avoid
Lord
Tarly’s
soldiers.
Later,
I
encountered
him
again,
at
the
Stinking
Goose.”

“The
Stinking
Goose?”
she
said,
uncertain.

“An
unsavory
place,”
the
dwarf
admitted.
“Lord
Tarly’s
men
patrol
the
port
at
Maidenpool,
but
the
Goose
is
always
full
of
sailors,
and
sailors
have
been
known
to
smuggle
men
aboard
their
ships,
if
the
price
is
right.
This
fool
was
seeking
passage
for
three
across
the
narrow
sea.
I
oft
saw
him
there,
talking
with
oarsmen
off
the
galleys.
Sometimes
he
would
sing
a
funny
song.”

“Seeking
passage
for
three?
Not
two?”

“Three,
m’lady.
That
I’d
swear
to,
by
the
Seven.”
Three,
she
thought.
Sansa,
Ser
Dontos...
but
who
would
be
the
third?
The
Imp?
“Did
the
fool
find
his
ship?”

“That
I
could
not
say,”
the
dwarf
told
her,
“but
one
night
some
of
Lord
Tarly’s
soldiers
visited
the
Goose
looking
for
him,
and
a
few
days
later
I
heard
another
man
boasting
that
he’d
fooled
a
fool
and
had
the
gold
to
prove
it.
He
was
drunk,
and
buying
ale
for
everyone.”

“‘Fooled
a
fool,’”
she
said.
“What
did
he
mean
by
that?”

“I
could
not
tell
you.
His
name
was
Nimble
Dick,
though,
that
I
do
recall.”
The
dwarf
spread
his
hands.
“I
fear
that’s
all
that
I
can
offer
you,
aside
from
a
small
man’s
prayers.”

True
to
her
word,
Brienne
bought
him
his
bowl
of
hot
crab
stew...
and
some
hot
fresh
bread
and
a
cup
of
wine
as
well.
As
he
ate
it,
standing
by
her
side,
she
mulled
what
he
had
told
her.
Could
the
Imp
have
joined
them?
If
Tyrion
Lannister
were
behind
Sansa’s
disappearance,
and
not
Dontos
Hollard,
it
stood
to
reason
that
they
would
need
to
flee
across
the
narrow
sea.

When
the
little
man
was
done
with
his
bowl
of
stew,
he
finished
what
was
left
of
hers
as
well.
“You
should
eat
more,”
he
said.
“A
woman
big
as
you
needs
t’
keep
her
strength
up.
It
is
not
far
to
Maidenpool,
but
the
road
is
perilous
these
days.”

I
know.
It
was
on
that
very
road
that
Ser
Cleos
Frey
had
died,
and
she
and
Ser
Jaime
had
been
taken
by
the
Bloody
Mummers.
Jaime
tried
to
kill
me,
she
remembered,
though
he
was
gaunt
and
weak,
and
his
wrists
were
chained.
It
had
been
a
close
thing,
even
so,
but
that
was
before
Zollo
hacked
his
hand
off.
Zollo
and
Rorge
and
Shagwell
would
have
raped
her
half
a
hundred
times
if
Ser
Jaime
had
not
told
them
she
was
worth
her
weight
in
sapphires.

“M’lady?
You
look
sad.
Are
you
thinking
of
your
sister?”
The
dwarf
patted
her
on
the
hand.
“The
Crone
will
light
your
way
to
her,
never
fear.
The
Maiden
will
keep
her
safe.”

“I
pray
that
you
are
right.”

“I
am.”
He
bowed.
“But
now
I
must
be
on
my
way.
I’ve
a
long
way
yet
to
go
to
reach
King’s
Landing.”

“Do
you
have
a
horse?
A
mule?”

“Two
mules.”
The
little
man
laughed.
“There
they
are,
at
the
bottom
of
my
legs.
They
get
me
where
I
want
t’
go.”
He
bowed,
and
waddled
to
the
door,
swaying
with
each
step.

She
remained
at
the
table
after
he
had
gone,
lingering
over
a
cup
of
watered
wine.
Brienne
did
not
oft
drink
wine,
but
once
in
a
great
while
she
found
it
helped
to
settle
her
belly.
And
where
do
I
want
to
go?
she
asked
herself.
To
Maidenpool,
to
look
for
a
man
named
Nimble
Dick
in
a
place
called
the
Stinking
Goose?

When
last
she
had
seen
Maidenpool,
the
town
had
been
a
desolation,
its
lord
shut
up
inside
his
castle,
its
smallfolk
dead
or
fled
or
hiding.
She
remembered
burned
houses
and
empty
streets,
smashed
and
broken
gates.
Feral
dogs
had
skulked
along
behind
their
horses,
whilst
swollen
corpses
floated
like
huge
pale
water
lilies
atop
the
spring-fed
pool
that
gave
the
town
its
name.
Jaime
sang
“Six
Maids
in
a
Pool,”
and
laughed
when
I
begged
him
to
be
quiet.
And
Randyll
Tarly
was
at
Maidenpool
as
well,
another
reason
for
her
to
avoid
the
town.
She
might
do
better
to
take
ship
for
Gulltown
or
White
Harbor.
I
could
do
both,
though.
Pay
a
call
on
the
Stinking
Goose
and
talk
to
this
Nimble
Dick,
then
find
a
ship
at
Maidenpool
to
take
me
farther
north.

The
common
room
had
begun
to
empty.
Brienne
tore
a
chunk
of
bread
in
half,
listening
to
the
talk
at
the
other
tables.
Most
of
it
concerned
the
death
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister.
“Murdered
by
his
own
son,
they
say,”
a
local
man
was
saying,
a
cobbler
by
the
look
of
him,
“that
vile
little
dwarf.”

“And
the
king
is
just
a
boy,”
said
the
oldest
of
the
four
septas.
“Who
is
to
rule
us
till
he
comes
of
age?”

“Lord
Tywin’s
brother,”
said
a
guardsman.
“Or
that
Lord
Tyrell,
might
be.
Or
the
Kingslayer.”

“Not
him,”
declared
the
innkeep.
“Not
that
oathbreaker.”
He
spat
into
the
fire.
Brienne
let
the
bread
fall
from
her
hands
and
wiped
the
crumbs
off
on
her
breeches.
She’d
heard
enough.

That
night
she
dreamed
herself
in
Renly’s
tent
again.
All
the
candles
were
guttering
out,
and
the
cold
was
thick
around
her.
Something
was
moving
through
green
darkness,
something
foul
and
horrible
was
hurtling
toward
her
king.
She
wanted
to
protect
him,
but
her
limbs
felt
stiff
and
frozen,
and
it
took
more
strength
than
she
had
just
to
lift
her
hand.
And
when
the
shadow
sword
sliced
through
the
green
steel
gorget
and
the
blood
began
to
flow,
she
saw
that
the
dying
king
was
not
Renly
after
all
but
Jaime
Lannister,
and
she
had
failed
him.

The
captain’s
sister
found
her
in
the
common
room,
drinking
a
cup
of
milk
and
honey
with
three
raw
eggs
mixed
in.
“You
did
beautifully,”
she
said,
when
the
woman
showed
her
the
freshly
painted
shield.
It
was
more
a
picture
than
a
proper
coat
of
arms,
and
the
sight
of
it
took
her
back
through
the
long
years,
to
the
cool
dark
of
her
father’s
armory.
She
remembered
how
she’d
run
her
fingertips
across
the
cracked
and
fading
paint,
over
the
green
leaves
of
the
tree,
and
along
the
path
of
the
falling
star.

Brienne
paid
the
captain’s
sister
half
again
the
sum
they
had
agreed,
and
slung
the
shield
across
one
shoulder
when
she
left
the
inn,
after
buying
some
hardbread,
cheese,
and
flour
from
the
cook.
She
left
the
town
by
the
north
gate,
riding
slowly
through
the
fields
and
farms
where
the
worst
of
the
fighting
had
been,
when
the
wolves
came
down
on
Duskendale.

Lord
Randyll
Tarly
had
commanded
Joffrey’s
army,
made
up
of
westermen
and
stormlanders
and
knights
from
the
Reach.
Those
men
of
his
who
had
died
here
had
been
carried
back
inside
the
walls,
to
rest
in
heroes’
tombs
beneath
the
septs
of
Duskendale.
The
northern
dead,
far
more
numerous,
were
buried
in
a
common
grave
beside
the
sea.
Above
the
cairn
that
marked
their
resting
place,
the
victors
had
raised
a
rough-hewn
wooden
marker.
HERE
LIE
THE
WOLVES
was
all
it
said.
Brienne
stopped
beside
it
and
said
a
silent
prayer
for
them,
and
for
Catelyn
Stark
and
her
son
Robb
and
all
the
men
who’d
died
with
them
as
well.

She
remembered
the
night
that
Lady
Catelyn
had
learned
her
sons
were
dead,
the
two
young
boys
she’d
left
at
Winterfell
to
keep
them
safe.
Brienne
had
known
that
something
was
terribly
amiss.
She
had
asked
her
if
there
had
been
news
of
her
sons.
“I
have
no
sons
but
Robb,”
Lady
Catelyn
had
replied.
She
had
sounded
as
if
a
knife
were
twisting
her
belly.
Brienne
had
reached
across
the
table
to
give
her
comfort,
but
she
stopped
before
her
fingers
brushed
the
older
woman’s,
for
fear
that
she
would
flinch
away.
Lady
Catelyn
had
turned
over
her
hands,
to
show
Brienne
the
scars
on
her
palms
and
fingers
where
a
knife
once
bit
deep
into
her
flesh.
Then
she
had
begun
to
talk
about
her
daughters.
“Sansa
was
a
little
lady,”
she
had
said,
“always
courteous
and
eager
to
please.
She
loved
tales
of
knightly
valor.
She
will
grow
into
a
woman
far
more
beautiful
than
I,
you
can
see
that.
I
would
often
brush
her
hair
myself.
She
had
auburn
hair,
thick
and
soft...
the
red
in
it
would
shine
like
copper
in
the
light
of
the
torches.”

She
had
spoken
of
Arya
too,
her
younger
daughter,
but
Arya
was
lost,
most
likely
dead
by
now.
Sansa,
though...
I
will
find
her,
my
lady,
Brienne
swore
to
Lady
Catelyn’s
restless
shade.
I
will
never
stop
looking.
I
will
give
up
my
life
if
need
be,
give
up
my
honor,
give
up
all
my
dreams,
but
I
will
find
her.

Beyond
the
battleground
the
road
ran
beside
the
shore,
between
the
surging
grey-green
sea
and
a
line
of
low
limestone
hills.
Brienne
was
not
the
only
traveler
on
the
road.
There
were
fishing
villages
up
along
the
coast
for
many
leagues,
and
the
fisherfolk
used
this
road
to
take
their
fish
to
market.
She
rode
past
a
fishwife
and
her
daughters,
walking
home
with
empty
baskets
on
their
shoulders.
In
her
armor,
they
took
her
for
a
knight
until
they
saw
her
face.
Then
the
girls
whispered
to
one
another
and
gave
her
looks.
“Have
you
seen
a
maid
of
three-and-ten
along
the
road?”
she
asked
them.
“A
highborn
maid
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair?”
Ser
Shadrich
had
made
her
wary,
but
she
had
to
keep
on
trying.
“She
may
have
been
traveling
with
a
fool.”
But
they
only
shook
their
heads
and
giggled
at
her
behind
their
hands.

In
the
first
village
she
came
to,
barefoot
boys
ran
along
beside
her
horse.
She
had
donned
her
helm,
stung
by
the
giggles
of
the
fisherfolk,
so
they
took
her
for
a
man.
One
boy
offered
to
sell
her
clams,
one
offered
crabs,
and
one
offered
her
his
sister.

Brienne
bought
three
crabs
from
the
second
boy.
By
the
time
she
left
the
village
it
had
begun
to
rain,
and
the
wind
was
rising.
Storm
coming,
she
thought,
glancing
out
to
sea.
The
raindrops
pinged
against
the
steel
of
her
helm,
making
her
ears
ring
as
she
rode,
but
it
was
better
than
being
out
there
in
a
boat.

An
hour
farther
north,
the
road
divided
at
a
pile
of
tumbled
stones
that
marked
the
ruins
of
a
small
castle.
The
right-hand
fork
followed
the
coast,
meandering
up
along
the
shore
toward
Crackclaw
Point,
a
dismal
land
of
bogs
and
pine
barrens;
the
left-hand
ran
through
hills
and
fields
and
woods
to
Maidenpool.
The
rain
was
falling
more
heavily
by
then.
Brienne
dismounted
and
led
her
mare
off
the
road
to
take
shelter
amongst
the
ruins.
The
course
of
the
castle
walls
could
still
be
discerned
amongst
the
brambles,
weeds,
and
wild
elms,
but
the
stones
that
had
made
them
up
were
strewn
like
a
child’s
blocks
between
the
roads.
Part
of
the
main
keep
still
stood,
however.
Its
triple
towers
were
grey
granite,
like
the
broken
walls,
but
their
merlons
were
yellow
sandstone.
Three
crowns,
she
realized,
as
she
gazed
at
them
through
the
rain.
Three
golden
crowns.
This
had
been
a
Hollard
castle.
Ser
Dontos
had
been
born
here,
like
as
not.

She
led
her
mare
through
the
rubble
to
the
keep’s
main
entrance.
Of
the
door
only
rusted
iron
hinges
remained,
but
the
roof
was
still
sound,
and
it
was
dry
within.
Brienne
tied
her
mare
to
a
wall
sconce,
took
off
her
helm,
and
shook
out
her
hair.
She
was
searching
for
some
dry
wood
to
light
a
fire
when
she
heard
the
sound
of
another
horse,
coming
closer.
Some
instinct
made
her
step
back
into
the
shadows,
where
she
could
not
be
seen
from
the
road.
This
was
the
very
road
where
she
and
Ser
Jaime
had
been
captured.
She
did
not
intend
to
suffer
that
again.

The
rider
was
a
small
man.
The
Mad
Mouse,
she
thought,
at
her
first
sight
of
him.
Somehow
he’s
followed
me.
Her
hand
went
to
her
sword
hilt,
and
she
found
herself
wondering
if
Ser
Shadrich
would
think
her
easy
prey
just
because
she
was
a
woman.
Lord
Grandison’s
castellan
had
once
made
that
error.
Humfrey
Wagstaff
was
his
name;
a
proud
old
man
of
five-and-sixty,
with
a
nose
like
a
hawk
and
a
spotted
head.
The
day
they
were
betrothed,
he
warned
Brienne
that
he
would
expect
her
to
be
a
proper
woman
once
they’d
wed.
“I
will
not
have
my
lady
wife
cavorting
about
in
man’s
mail.
On
this
you
shall
obey
me,
lest
I
be
forced
to
chastise
you.”

She
was
sixteen
and
no
stranger
to
a
sword,
but
still
shy
despite
her
prowess
in
the
yard.
Yet
somehow
she
had
found
the
courage
to
tell
Ser
Humfrey
that
she
would
accept
chastisement
only
from
a
man
who
could
outfight
her.
The
old
knight
purpled,
but
agreed
to
don
his
own
armor
to
teach
her
a
woman’s
proper
place.
They
fought
with
blunted
tourney
weapons,
so
Brienne’s
mace
had
no
spikes.
She
broke
Ser
Humfrey’s
collarbone,
two
ribs,
and
their
betrothal.
He
was
her
third
prospective
husband,
and
her
last.
Her
father
did
not
insist
again.

If
it
was
Ser
Shadrich
dogging
her
heels,
she
might
well
have
a
fight
on
her
hands.
She
did
not
intend
to
partner
with
the
man
or
let
him
follow
her
to
Sansa.
He
had
the
sort
of
easy
arrogance
that
comes
with
skill
at
arms,
she
thought,
but
he
was
small.
I’ll
have
the
reach
on
him,
and
I
should
be
stronger
too.

Brienne
was
as
strong
as
most
knights,
and
her
old
master-at-arms
used
to
say
that
she
was
quicker
than
any
woman
her
size
had
any
right
to
be.
The
gods
had
given
her
stamina
too,
which
Ser
Goodwin
deemed
a
noble
gift.
Fighting
with
sword
and
shield
was
a
wearisome
business,
and
victory
oft
went
to
the
man
with
most
endurance.
Ser
Goodwin
had
taught
her
to
fight
cautiously,
to
conserve
her
strength
while
letting
her
foes
spend
theirs
in
furious
attacks.
“Men
will
always
underestimate
you,”
he
said,
“and
their
pride
will
make
them
want
to
vanquish
you
quickly,
lest
it
be
said
that
a
woman
tried
them
sorely.”
She
had
learned
the
truth
of
that
once
she
went
into
the
world.
Even
Jaime
Lannister
had
come
at
her
that
way,
in
the
woods
by
Maidenpool.
If
the
gods
were
good,
the
Mad
Mouse
would
make
the
same
mistake.
He
may
be
a
seasoned
knight,
she
thought,
but
he
is
no
Jaime
Lannister.
She
slid
her
sword
out
of
its
scabbard.

But
it
was
not
Ser
Shadrich’s
chestnut
courser
that
drew
up
where
the
road
forked,
but
a
broken-down
old
piebald
rounsey
with
a
skinny
boy
upon
his
back.
When
Brienne
saw
the
horse
she
drew
back
in
confusion.
Only
some
boy,
she
thought,
until
she
glimpsed
the
face
beneath
his
hood.
The
boy
in
Duskendale,
the
one
who
bumped
into
me.
It’s
him.

The
boy
never
gave
the
ruined
castle
a
glance,
but
looked
down
one
road,
then
the
other.
After
a
moment’s
hesitation,
he
turned
the
rounsey
toward
the
hills
and
plodded
on.
Brienne
watched
him
vanish
through
the
falling
rain,
and
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
she
had
seen
this
same
boy
in
Rosby.
He
is
stalking
me,
she
realized,
but
that’s
a
game
that
two
can
play.
She
untied
her
mare,
climbed
back
into
the
saddle,
and
went
after
him.

The
boy
was
staring
at
the
ground
as
he
rode,
watching
the
ruts
in
the
road
fill
up
with
water.
The
rain
muffled
the
sound
of
her
approach,
and
no
doubt
his
hood
played
a
part
as
well.
He
never
looked
back
once,
until
Brienne
trotted
up
behind
him
and
gave
the
rounsey
a
whack
across
the
rump
with
the
flat
of
her
longsword.

The
horse
reared,
and
the
skinny
boy
went
flying,
his
cloak
flapping
like
a
pair
of
wings.
He
landed
in
the
mud
and
came
up
with
dirt
and
dead
brown
grass
between
his
teeth
to
find
Brienne
standing
over
him.
It
was
the
same
boy,
beyond
a
doubt.
She
recognized
the
sty.
“Who
are
you?”
she
demanded.

The
boy’s
mouth
worked
soundlessly.
His
eyes
were
big
as
eggs.
“Puh,”
was
all
he
could
manage.
“Puh.”
His
chainmail
byrnie
made
a
rattling
sound
when
he
shivered.
“Puh.
Puh.”

“Please?”
said
Brienne.
“Are
you
saying
please?”
She
laid
the
point
of
her
sword
on
the
apple
of
his
throat.
“Please
tell
me
who
you
are,
and
why
you’re
following
me.”

“Not
puh-puh-please.”
He
stuck
a
finger
in
his
mouth,
and
flicked
away
a
clump
of
mud,
spitting.
“Puh-puh-Pod.
My
name.
Puh-puh-Podrick.
Puh-Payne.”

Brienne
lowered
her
sword.
She
felt
a
rush
of
sympathy
for
the
boy.
She
remembered
a
day
at
Evenfall,
and
a
young
knight
with
a
rose
in
his
hand.
He
brought
the
rose
to
give
to
me.
Or
so
her
septa
told
her.
All
she
had
to
do
was
welcome
him
to
her
father’s
castle.
He
was
eighteen,
with
long
red
hair
that
tumbled
to
his
shoulders.
She
was
twelve,
tightly
laced
into
a
stiff
new
gown,
its
bodice
bright
with
garnets.
The
two
of
them
were
of
a
height,
but
she
could
not
look
him
in
the
eye,
nor
say
the
simple
words
her
septa
had
taught
her.
Ser
Ronnet.
I
welcome
you
to
my
lord
father’s
hall.
It
is
good
to
look
upon
your
face
at
last.

“Why
are
you
following
me?”
she
demanded
of
the
boy.
“Were
you
told
to
spy
upon
me?
Do
you
belong
to
Varys,
or
the
queen?”

“No.
Not
neither.
No
one.”

Brienne
put
his
age
at
ten,
but
she
was
terrible
at
judging
how
old
a
child
was.
She
always
thought
they
were
younger
than
they
were,
perhaps
because
she
had
always
been
big
for
her
age.
Freakish
big,
Septa
Roelle
used
to
say,
and
mannish.
“This
road
is
too
dangerous
for
a
boy
alone.”

“Not
for
a
squire.
I’m
his
squire.
The
Hand’s
squire.”

“Lord
Tywin?”
Brienne
sheathed
her
blade.

“No.
Not
that
Hand.
The
one
before.
His
son.
I
fought
with
him
in
the
battle.
I
shouted
‘Halfman!
Halfman!’”

The
Imp’s
squire.
Brienne
had
not
even
known
he
had
one.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
no
knight.
He
might
have
been
expected
to
have
a
serving
boy
or
two
to
attend
him,
she
supposed,
a
page
and
a
cupbearer,
someone
to
help
dress
him.
But
a
squire?
“Why
are
you
stalking
after
me?”
she
said.
“What
do
you
want?”

“To
find
her.”
The
boy
got
to
his
feet.
“His
lady.
You’re
looking
for
her.
Brella
told
me.
She’s
his
wife.
Not
Brella,
Lady
Sansa.
So
I
thought,
if
you
found
her...”
His
face
twisted
in
sudden
anguish.
“I’m
his
squire,”
he
repeated,
as
the
rain
ran
down
his
face,
“but
he
left
me.”





SANSA

Once,
when
she
was
just
a
little
girl,
a
wandering
singer
had
stayed
with
them
at
Winterfell
for
half
a
year.
An
old
man
he
was,
with
white
hair
and
windburnt
cheeks,
but
he
sang
of
knights
and
quests
and
ladies
fair,
and
Sansa
had
cried
bitter
tears
when
he
left
them,
and
begged
her
father
not
to
let
him
go.
“The
man
has
played
us
every
song
he
knows
thrice
over,”
Lord
Eddard
told
her
gently.
“I
cannot
keep
him
here
against
his
will.
You
need
not
weep,
though.
I
promise
you,
other
singers
will
come.”

They
hadn’t,
though,
not
for
a
year
or
more.
Sansa
had
prayed
to
the
Seven
in
their
sept
and
old
gods
of
the
heart
tree,
asking
them
to
bring
the
old
man
back,
or
better
still
to
send
another
singer,
young
and
handsome.
But
the
gods
never
answered,
and
the
halls
of
Winterfell
stayed
silent.

But
that
was
when
she
was
a
little
girl,
and
foolish.
She
was
a
maiden
now,
three-and-ten
and
flowered.
All
her
nights
were
full
of
song,
and
by
day
she
prayed
for
silence.

If
the
Eyrie
had
been
made
like
other
castles,
only
rats
and
gaolers
would
have
heard
the
dead
man
singing.
Dungeon
walls
were
thick
enough
to
swallow
songs
and
screams
alike.
But
the
sky
cells
had
a
wall
of
empty
air,
so
every
chord
the
dead
man
played
flew
free
to
echo
off
the
stony
shoulders
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
And
the
songs
he
chose...
He
sang
of
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons,
of
fair
Jonquil
and
her
fool,
of
Jenny
of
Oldstones
and
the
Prince
of
Dragonflies.
He
sang
of
betrayals,
and
murders
most
foul,
of
hanged
men
and
bloody
vengeance.
He
sang
of
grief
and
sadness.

No
matter
where
she
went
in
the
castle,
Sansa
could
not
escape
the
music.
It
floated
up
the
winding
tower
steps,
found
her
naked
in
her
bath,
supped
with
her
at
dusk,
and
stole
into
her
bedchamber
even
when
she
latched
the
shutters
tight.
It
came
in
on
the
cold
thin
air,
and
like
the
air,
it
chilled
her.
Though
it
had
not
snowed
upon
the
Eyrie
since
the
day
that
Lady
Lysa
fell,
the
nights
had
all
been
bitter
cold.

The
singer’s
voice
was
strong
and
sweet.
Sansa
thought
he
sounded
better
than
he
ever
had
before,
his
voice
richer
somehow,
full
of
pain
and
fear
and
longing.
She
did
not
understand
why
the
gods
would
have
given
such
a
voice
to
such
a
wicked
man.
He
would
have
taken
me
by
force
on
the
Fingers
if
Petyr
had
not
set
Ser
Lothor
to
watch
over
me,
she
had
to
remind
herself.
And
he
played
to
drown
out
my
cries
when
Aunt
Lysa
tried
to
kill
me.

That
did
not
make
the
songs
any
easier
to
hear.
“Please,”
she
begged
Lord
Petyr,
“can’t
you
make
him
stop?”

“I
gave
the
man
my
word,
sweetling.”
Petyr
Baelish,
Lord
of
Harrenhal,
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident,
and
Lord
Protector
of
the
Eyrie
and
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
looked
up
from
the
letter
he
was
writing.
He
had
written
a
hundred
letters
since
Lady
Lysa’s
fall.
Sansa
had
seen
the
ravens
coming
and
going
from
the
rookery.
“I’d
sooner
suffer
his
singing
than
listen
to
his
sobbing.”

It
is
better
that
he
sings,
yes,
but...
“Must
he
play
all
night,
my
lord?
Lord
Robert
cannot
sleep.
He
cries...”

“...for
his
mother.
That
cannot
be
helped,
the
wench
is
dead.”
Petyr
shrugged.
“It
will
not
be
much
longer.
Lord
Nestor
is
making
his
ascent
on
the
morrow.”

Sansa
had
met
Lord
Nestor
Royce
once
before,
after
Petyr’s
wedding
to
her
aunt.
Royce
was
the
Keeper
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon,
the
great
castle
that
stood
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
guarded
the
steps
up
to
the
Eyrie.
The
wedding
party
had
guested
with
him
overnight
before
beginning
their
ascent.
Lord
Nestor
had
scarce
looked
at
her
twice,
but
the
prospect
of
him
coming
here
terrified
her.
He
was
High
Steward
of
the
Vale
as
well,
Jon
Arryn’s
trusted
liege
man,
and
Lady
Lysa’s.
“He
won’t...
you
won’t
let
Lord
Nestor
see
Marillion,
will
you?”

Her
horror
must
have
shown
on
her
face,
since
Petyr
put
down
his
quill.
“On
the
contrary.
I
shall
insist
on
it.”
He
beckoned
her
to
take
the
seat
beside
him.
“We
have
come
to
an
agreement,
Marillion
and
I.
Mord
can
be
most
persuasive.
And
if
our
singer
disappoints
us
and
sings
a
song
we
do
not
care
to
hear,
why,
you
and
I
need
only
say
he
lies.
Whom
do
you
imagine
Lord
Nestor
will
believe?”

“Us?”
Sansa
wished
she
could
be
certain.

“Of
course.
Our
lies
will
profit
him.”

The
solar
was
warm,
the
fire
crackling
merrily,
but
Sansa
shivered
all
the
same.
“Yes,
but...
but
what
if...”

“What
if
Lord
Nestor
values
honor
more
than
profit?”
Petyr
put
his
arm
around
her.
“What
if
it
is
truth
he
wants,
and
justice
for
his
murdered
lady?”
He
smiled.
“I
know
Lord
Nestor,
sweetling.
Do
you
imagine
I’d
ever
let
him
harm
my
daughter?”

I
am
not
your
daughter,
she
thought.
I
am
Sansa
Stark,
Lord
Eddard’s
daughter
and
Lady
Catelyn’s,
the
blood
of
Winterfell.
She
did
not
say
it,
though.
If
not
for
Petyr
Baelish
it
would
have
been
Sansa
who
went
spinning
through
a
cold
blue
sky
to
stony
death
six
hundred
feet
below,
instead
of
Lysa
Arryn.
He
is
so
bold.
Sansa
wished
she
had
his
courage.
She
wanted
to
crawl
back
into
bed
and
hide
beneath
her
blanket,
to
sleep
and
sleep.
She
had
not
slept
a
whole
night
through
since
Lysa
Arryn’s
death.
“Couldn’t
you
tell
Lord
Nestor
that
I
am...
indisposed,
or...”

“He
will
want
to
hear
your
account
of
Lysa’s
death.”

“My
lord,
if...
if
Marillion
tells
what
truly...”

“If
he
lies,
you
mean?”

“Lies?
Yes...
if
he
lies,
if
it
is
my
tale
against
his,
and
Lord
Nestor
looks
in
my
eyes
and
sees
how
scared
I
am...”

“A
touch
of
fear
will
not
be
out
of
place,
Alayne.
You’ve
seen
a
fearful
thing.
Nestor
will
be
moved.”
Petyr
studied
her
eyes,
as
if
seeing
them
for
the
first
time.
“You
have
your
mother’s
eyes.
Honest
eyes,
and
innocent.
Blue
as
a
sunlit
sea.
When
you
are
a
little
older,
many
a
man
will
drown
in
those
eyes.”

Sansa
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that.

“All
you
need
do
is
tell
Lord
Nestor
the
same
tale
that
you
told
Lord
Robert,”
Petyr
went
on.

Robert
is
only
a
sick
little
boy,
she
thought,
Lord
Nestor
is
a
man
grown,
stern
and
suspicious.
Robert
was
not
strong
and
had
to
be
protected,
even
from
the
truth.
“Some
lies
are
love,”
Petyr
had
assured
her.
She
reminded
him
of
that.
“When
we
lied
to
Lord
Robert,
that
was
just
to
spare
him,”
she
said.

“And
this
lie
may
spare
us.
Else
you
and
I
must
leave
the
Eyrie
by
the
same
door
Lysa
used.”
Petyr
picked
up
his
quill
again.
“We
shall
serve
him
lies
and
Arbor
gold,
and
he’ll
drink
them
down
and
ask
for
more,
I
promise
you.”

He
is
serving
me
lies
as
well,
Sansa
realized.
They
were
comforting
lies,
though,
and
she
thought
them
kindly
meant.
A
lie
is
not
so
bad
if
it
is
kindly
meant.
If
only
she
believed
them...

The
things
her
aunt
had
said
just
before
she
fell
still
troubled
Sansa
greatly.
“Ravings,”
Petyr
called
them.
“My
wife
was
mad,
you
saw
that
for
yourself.”
And
so
she
had.
All
I
did
was
build
a
snow
castle,
and
she
meant
to
push
me
out
the
Moon
Door.
Petyr
saved
me.
He
loved
my
mother
well,
and...

And
her?
How
could
she
doubt
it?
He
had
saved
her.

He
saved
Alayne,
his
daughter,
a
voice
within
her
whispered.
But
she
was
Sansa
too...
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
Lord
Protector
was
two
people
as
well.
He
was
Petyr,
her
protector,
warm
and
funny
and
gentle...
but
he
was
also
Littlefinger,
the
lord
she’d
known
at
King’s
Landing,
smiling
slyly
and
stroking
his
beard
as
he
whispered
in
Queen
Cersei’s
ear.
And
Littlefinger
was
no
friend
of
hers.
When
Joff
had
her
beaten,
the
Imp
defended
her,
not
Littlefinger.
When
the
mob
sought
to
rape
her,
the
Hound
carried
her
to
safety,
not
Littlefinger.
When
the
Lannisters
wed
her
to
Tyrion
against
her
will,
Ser
Garlan
the
Gallant
gave
her
comfort,
not
Littlefinger.
Littlefinger
never
lifted
so
much
as
his
little
finger
for
her.

Except
to
get
me
out.
He
did
that
for
me.
I
thought
it
was
Ser
Dontos,
my
poor
old
drunken
Florian,
but
it
was
Petyr
all
the
while.
Littlefinger
was
only
a
mask
he
had
to
wear.
Only
sometimes
Sansa
found
it
hard
to
tell
where
the
man
ended
and
the
mask
began.
Littlefinger
and
Lord
Petyr
looked
so
very
much
alike.
She
would
have
fled
them
both,
perhaps,
but
there
was
nowhere
for
her
to
go.
Winterfell
was
burned
and
desolate,
Bran
and
Rickon
dead
and
cold.
Robb
had
been
betrayed
and
murdered
at
the
Twins,
along
with
their
lady
mother.
Tyrion
had
been
put
to
death
for
killing
Joffrey,
and
if
she
ever
returned
to
King’s
Landing
the
queen
would
have
her
head
as
well.
The
aunt
she’d
hoped
would
keep
her
safe
had
tried
to
murder
her
instead.
Her
uncle
Edmure
was
a
captive
of
the
Freys,
while
her
great-uncle
the
Blackfish
was
under
siege
at
Riverrun.
I
have
no
place
but
here,
Sansa
thought
miserably,
and
no
true
friend
but
Petyr.

That
night
the
dead
man
sang
“The
Day
They
Hanged
Black
Robin,”
“The
Mother’s
Tears,”
and
“The
Rains
of
Castamere.”
Then
he
stopped
for
a
while,
but
just
as
Sansa
began
to
drift
off
he
started
to
play
again.
He
sang
“Six
Sorrows,”
“Fallen
Leaves,”
and
“Alysanne.”
Such
sad
songs,
she
thought.
When
she
closed
her
eyes
she
could
see
him
in
his
sky
cell,
huddled
in
a
corner
away
from
the
cold
black
sky,
crouched
beneath
a
fur
with
his
woodharp
cradled
against
his
chest.
I
must
not
pity
him,
she
told
herself.
He
was
vain
and
cruel,
and
soon
he
will
be
dead.
She
could
not
save
him.
And
why
should
she
want
to?
Marillion
tried
to
rape
her,
and
Petyr
had
saved
her
life
not
once
but
twice.
Some
lies
you
have
to
tell.
Lies
had
been
all
that
kept
her
alive
in
King’s
Landing.
If
she
had
not
lied
to
Joffrey,
his
Kingsguard
would
have
beat
her
bloody.

After
“Alysanne”
the
singer
stopped
again,
long
enough
for
Sansa
to
snatch
an
hour’s
rest.
But
as
the
first
light
of
dawn
was
prying
at
her
shutters,
she
heard
the
soft
strains
of
“On
a
Misty
Morn”
drifting
up
from
below,
and
woke
at
once.
That
was
more
properly
a
woman’s
song,
a
lament
sung
by
a
mother
on
the
dawn
after
some
terrible
battle,
as
she
searches
amongst
the
dead
for
the
body
of
her
only
son.
The
mother
sings
her
grief
for
her
dead
son,
Sansa
thought,
but
Marillion
grieves
for
his
fingers,
for
his
eyes.
The
words
rose
like
arrows
and
pierced
her
in
the
darkness.



Oh,
have
you
seen
my
boy,
good
ser?

His
hair
is
chestnut
brown

He
promised
he’d
come
back
to
me

Our
home’s
in
Wendish
Town.



Sansa
covered
her
ears
with
a
goose
down
pillow
to
shut
out
the
rest
of
it,
but
it
was
no
good.
Day
had
come
and
she
had
woken,
and
Lord
Nestor
Royce
was
coming
up
the
mountain.

The
High
Steward
and
his
party
reached
the
Eyrie
in
the
late
afternoon,
with
the
valley
gold
and
red
beneath
them
and
the
wind
rising.
He
brought
his
son
Ser
Albar,
along
with
a
dozen
knights
and
a
score
of
men-at-arms.
So
many
strangers.
Sansa
looked
at
their
faces
anxiously,
wondering
if
they
were
friends
or
foes.

Petyr
welcomed
his
visitors
in
a
black
velvet
doublet
with
grey
sleeves
that
matched
his
woolen
breeches
and
lent
a
certain
darkness
to
his
grey-green
eyes.
Maester
Colemon
stood
beside
him,
his
chain
of
many
metals
hanging
loose
about
his
long,
skinny
neck.
Although
the
maester
was
much
the
taller
of
the
two
men,
it
was
the
Lord
Protector
who
drew
the
eye.
He
had
put
away
his
smiles
for
the
day,
it
seemed.
He
listened
solemnly
as
Royce
introduced
the
knights
who
had
accompanied
him,
then
said,
“My
lords
are
welcome
here.
You
know
our
Maester
Colemon,
of
course.
Lord
Nestor,
you
will
recall
Alayne,
my
natural
daughter?”

“To
be
sure.”
Lord
Nestor
Royce
was
a
bullnecked,
barrel-chested,
balding
man
with
a
grey-shot
beard
and
a
stern
look.
He
inclined
his
head
a
whole
half
inch
in
greeting.

Sansa
curtsied,
too
frightened
to
speak
for
fear
she
might
misspeak.
Petyr
drew
her
to
her
feet.
“Sweetling,
be
a
good
girl
and
bring
Lord
Robert
to
the
High
Hall
to
receive
his
guests.”

“Yes,
Father.”
Her
voice
sounded
thin
and
strained.
A
liar’s
voice,
she
thought
as
she
hurried
up
the
steps
and
across
the
gallery
to
the
Moon
Tower.
A
guilty
voice.

Gretchel
and
Maddy
were
helping
Robert
Arryn
squirm
into
his
breeches
when
Sansa
stepped
into
his
bedchamber.
The
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
had
been
crying
again.
His
eyes
were
red
and
raw,
his
lashes
crusty,
his
nose
swollen
and
runny.
A
trail
of
snot
glistened
underneath
one
nostril,
and
his
lower
lip
was
bloody
where
he’d
bitten
it.
Lord
Nestor
must
not
see
him
like
this,
Sansa
thought,
despairing.
“Gretchel,
fetch
me
the
washbasin.”
She
took
the
boy
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
to
the
bed.
“Did
my
Sweetrobin
sleep
well
last
night?”

“No.”
He
sniffed.
“I
never
slept
one
bit,
Alayne.
He
was
singing
again,
and
my
door
was
locked.
I
called
for
them
to
let
me
out,
but
no
one
ever
came.
Someone
locked
me
in
my
room.”

“That
was
wicked
of
them.”
Dipping
a
soft
cloth
into
the
warm
water,
she
began
to
clean
his
face...
gently,
oh
so
gently.
If
you
scrubbed
Robert
too
briskly,
he
might
begin
to
shake.
The
boy
was
frail,
and
terribly
small
for
his
age.
He
was
eight,
but
Sansa
had
known
bigger
five-year-olds.

Robert’s
lip
quivered.
“I
was
going
to
come
sleep
with
you.”

I
know
you
were.
Sweetrobin
had
been
accustomed
to
crawling
in
beside
his
mother,
until
she
wed
Lord
Petyr.
Since
Lady
Lysa’s
death
he
had
taken
to
wandering
the
Eyrie
in
quest
of
other
beds.
The
one
he
liked
best
was
Sansa’s...
which
was
why
she
had
asked
Ser
Lothor
Brune
to
lock
his
door
last
night.
She
would
not
have
minded
if
he
only
slept,
but
he
was
always
trying
to
nuzzle
at
her
breasts,
and
when
he
had
his
shaking
spells
he
often
wet
the
bed.

“Lord
Nestor
Royce
has
come
up
from
the
Gates
to
see
you.”
Sansa
wiped
beneath
his
nose.

“I
don’t
want
to
see
him,”
he
said.
“I
want
a
story.
A
story
of
the
Winged
Knight.”

“After,”
Sansa
said.
“First
you
must
see
Lord
Nestor.”

“Lord
Nestor
has
a
mole,”
he
said,
squirming.
Robert
was
afraid
of
men
with
moles.
“Mommy
said
he
was
dreadful.”

“My
poor
Sweetrobin.”
Sansa
smoothed
his
hair
back.
“You
miss
her,
I
know.
Lord
Petyr
misses
her
too.
He
loved
her
just
as
you
do.”
That
was
a
lie,
though
kindly
meant.
The
only
woman
Petyr
ever
loved
was
Sansa’s
murdered
mother.
He
had
confessed
as
much
to
Lady
Lysa
just
before
he
pushed
her
out
the
Moon
Door.
She
was
mad
and
dangerous.
She
murdered
her
own
lord
husband,
and
would
have
murdered
me
if
Petyr
had
not
come
along
to
save
me.

Robert
did
not
need
to
know
that,
though.
He
was
only
a
sick
little
boy
who’d
loved
his
mother.
“There,”
Sansa
said,
“you
look
a
proper
lord
now.
Maddy,
fetch
his
cloak.”
It
was
lambswool,
soft
and
warm,
a
handsome
sky-blue
that
set
off
the
cream
color
of
his
tunic.
She
fastened
it
about
his
shoulders
with
a
silver
brooch
in
the
shape
of
a
crescent
moon,
and
took
him
by
the
hand.
Robert
came
meekly
for
once.

The
High
Hall
had
been
closed
since
Lady
Lysa’s
fall,
and
it
gave
Sansa
a
chill
to
enter
it
again.
The
hall
was
long
and
grand
and
beautiful,
she
supposed,
but
she
did
not
like
it
here.
It
was
a
pale
cold
place
at
the
best
of
times.
The
slender
pillars
looked
like
fingerbones,
and
the
blue
veins
in
the
white
marble
brought
to
mind
the
veins
in
an
old
crone’s
legs.
Though
fifty
silver
sconces
lined
the
walls,
less
than
a
dozen
torches
had
been
lit,
so
shadows
danced
upon
the
floors
and
pooled
in
every
corner.
Their
footsteps
echoed
off
the
marble,
and
Sansa
could
hear
the
wind
rattling
at
the
Moon
Door.
I
must
not
look
at
it,
she
told
herself,
else
I’ll
start
to
shake
as
badly
as
Robert.

With
Maddy’s
help,
she
got
Robert
seated
on
his
weirwood
throne
with
a
stack
of
pillows
underneath
him
and
sent
word
that
his
lordship
would
receive
his
guests.
Two
guards
in
sky-blue
cloaks
opened
the
doors
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall,
and
Petyr
ushered
them
in
and
down
the
long
blue
carpet
that
ran
between
the
rows
of
bone-white
pillars.

The
boy
greeted
Lord
Nestor
with
squeaky
courtesy
and
made
no
mention
of
his
mole.
When
the
High
Steward
asked
about
his
lady
mother,
Robert’s
hands
began
to
tremble
ever
so
slightly.
“Marillion
hurt
my
mother.
He
threw
her
out
the
Moon
Door.”

“Did
your
lordship
see
this
happen?”
asked
Ser
Marwyn
Belmore,
a
lanky
ginger-headed
knight
who
had
been
Lysa’s
captain
of
guards
till
Petyr
had
put
Ser
Lothor
Brune
in
his
place.

“Alayne
saw
it,”
the
boy
said.
“And
my
lord
stepfather.”

Lord
Nestor
looked
at
her.
Ser
Albar,
Ser
Marwyn,
Maester
Colemon,
all
of
them
were
looking.
She
was
my
aunt
but
she
wanted
to
kill
me,
Sansa
thought.
She
dragged
me
to
the
Moon
Door
and
tried
to
push
me
out.
I
never
wanted
a
kiss,
I
was
building
a
castle
in
the
snow.
She
hugged
herself
to
keep
from
shaking.

“Forgive
her,
my
lords,”
Petyr
Baelish
said
softly.
“She
still
has
nightmares
of
that
day.
Small
wonder
if
she
cannot
bear
to
speak
of
it.”
He
came
up
behind
her
and
put
his
hands
gently
on
her
shoulders.
“I
know
how
hard
this
is
for
you,
Alayne,
but
our
friends
must
hear
the
truth.”

“Yes.”
Her
throat
felt
so
dry
and
tight
it
almost
hurt
to
speak.
“I
saw...
I
was
with
the
Lady
Lysa
when...”
A
tear
rolled
down
her
cheek.
That’s
good,
a
tear
is
good.
“...when
Marillion...
pushed
her.”
And
she
told
the
tale
again,
hardly
hearing
the
words
as
they
spilled
out
of
her.

Before
she
was
half-done
Robert
began
to
cry,
the
pillows
shifting
perilously
beneath
him.
“He
killed
my
mother.
I
want
him
to
fly!”
The
trembling
in
his
hands
had
grown
worse,
and
his
arms
were
shaking
too.
The
boy’s
head
jerked
and
his
teeth
began
to
chatter.
“Fly!”
he
shrieked.
“Fly,
fly.”
His
arms
and
legs
flailed
wildly.
Lothor
Brune
strode
to
the
dais
in
time
to
catch
the
boy
as
he
slipped
from
his
throne.
Maester
Colemon
was
just
a
step
behind,
though
there
was
naught
that
he
could
do.

Helpless
as
the
rest,
Sansa
could
only
stand
and
watch
as
the
shaking
spell
ran
its
course.
One
of
Robert’s
legs
kicked
Ser
Lothor
in
the
face.
Brune
cursed,
but
still
held
on
as
the
boy
twitched
and
flailed
and
wet
himself.
Their
visitors
said
not
a
word;
Lord
Nestor
at
least
had
seen
these
fits
before.
It
was
long
moments
before
Robert’s
spasms
began
to
subside,
and
seemed
even
longer.
By
the
end,
the
little
lordling
was
so
weak
he
could
not
stand.
“Best
take
his
lordship
back
to
bed
and
bleed
him,”
Lord
Petyr
said.
Brune
lifted
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
from
the
hall.
Maester
Colemon
followed,
grim-faced.

When
their
footsteps
died
away
there
was
no
sound
in
the
High
Hall
of
the
Eyrie.
Sansa
could
hear
the
night
wind
moaning
outside
and
scratching
at
the
Moon
Door.
She
was
very
cold
and
very
tired.
Must
I
tell
the
tale
again?
she
wondered.

But
she
must
have
told
it
well
enough.
Lord
Nestor
cleared
his
throat.
“I
misliked
that
singer
from
the
first,”
he
grumbled.
“I
urged
Lady
Lysa
to
send
him
away.
Many
a
time
I
urged
her.”

“You
always
gave
her
good
counsel,
my
lord,”
Petyr
said.

“She
took
no
heed
of
it,”
Royce
complained.
“She
heard
me
grudgingly
and
took
no
heed.”

“My
lady
was
too
trusting
for
this
world.”
Petyr
spoke
so
tenderly
that
Sansa
would
have
believed
he’d
loved
his
wife.
“Lysa
could
not
see
the
evil
in
men,
only
the
good.
Marillion
sang
sweet
songs,
and
she
mistook
that
for
his
nature.”

“He
called
us
pigs,”
Ser
Albar
Royce
said.
A
blunt
broad-shouldered
knight
who
shaved
his
chin
but
cultivated
thick
black
side-whiskers
that
framed
his
homely
face
like
hedgerows,
Ser
Albar
was
a
younger
version
of
his
father.
“He
made
a
song
about
two
pigs
snuffling
round
a
mountain,
eating
a
falcon’s
leavings.
That
was
meant
to
be
us,
but
when
I
said
so
he
laughed
at
me.
‘Why,
ser,
’tis
a
song
about
some
pigs,’
he
said.”

“He
made
mock
of
me
as
well,”
Ser
Marwyn
Belmore
said.
“Ser
Ding-Dong,
he
named
me.
When
I
vowed
I’d
cut
his
tongue
out,
he
ran
to
Lady
Lysa
and
hid
behind
her
skirts.”

“As
oft
he
did,”
Lord
Nestor
said.
“The
man
was
craven,
but
the
favor
Lady
Lysa
showed
him
made
him
insolent.
She
dressed
him
like
a
lord,
gave
him
gold
rings
and
a
moonstone
belt.”

“Even
Lord
Jon’s
favorite
falcon.”
The
knight’s
doublet
showed
the
six
white
candles
of
Waxley.
“His
lordship
loved
that
bird.
King
Robert
gave
it
to
him.”

Petyr
Baelish
sighed.
“It
was
unseemly,”
he
agreed,
“and
I
put
an
end
to
it.
Lysa
agreed
to
send
him
away.
That
was
why
she
met
him
here,
that
day.
I
should
have
been
with
her,
but
I
never
dreamt...
if
I
had
not
insisted...
it
was
I
who
killed
her.”

No,
Sansa
thought,
you
mustn’t
say
that,
you
mustn’t
tell
them,
you
mustn’t.
But
Albar
Royce
was
shaking
his
head.
“No,
my
lord,
you
must
not
blame
yourself,”
he
said.

“This
was
the
singer’s
work,”
his
father
agreed.
“Bring
him
up,
Lord
Petyr.
Let
us
write
an
end
to
this
sorry
business.”

Petyr
Baelish
composed
himself,
and
said,
“As
you
wish,
my
lord.”
He
turned
to
his
guardsmen
and
spoke
a
command,
and
the
singer
was
fetched
up
from
the
dungeons.
The
gaoler
Mord
came
with
him,
a
monstrous
man
with
small
black
eyes
and
a
lopsided,
scarred
face.
One
ear
and
part
of
his
cheek
had
been
cleaved
off
in
some
battle,
but
twenty
stone
of
pallid
white
flesh
remained.
His
clothes
fit
poorly
and
had
a
rank,
ripe
smell.

Marillion
by
contrast
looked
almost
elegant.
Someone
had
bathed
him
and
dressed
him
in
a
pair
of
sky-blue
breeches
and
a
loose-fitting
white
tunic
with
puffed
sleeves,
belted
with
a
silvery
sash
that
had
been
a
gift
from
Lady
Lysa.
White
silk
gloves
covered
his
hands,
while
a
white
silk
bandage
spared
the
lords
the
sight
of
his
eyes.

Mord
stood
behind
him
with
a
lash.
When
the
gaoler
prodded
him
in
the
ribs,
the
singer
went
to
one
knee.
“Good
lords,
I
beg
your
forgiveness.”

Lord
Nestor
scowled.
“You
confess
your
crime?”

“If
I
had
eyes
I
should
weep.”
The
singer’s
voice,
so
strong
and
sure
by
night,
was
cracked
and
whispery
now.
“I
loved
her
so,
I
could
not
bear
to
see
her
in
another’s
arms,
to
know
she
shared
his
bed.
I
meant
no
harm
to
my
sweet
lady,
I
swear
it.
I
barred
the
door
so
no
one
could
disturb
us
whilst
I
declared
my
passion,
but
Lady
Lysa
was
so
cold...
when
she
told
that
she
was
carrying
Lord
Petyr’s
child,
a...
a
madness
seized
me...”

Sansa
stared
at
his
hands
while
he
spoke.
Fat
Maddy
claimed
that
Mord
had
taken
off
three
of
his
fingers,
both
pinkies
and
a
ring
finger.
His
little
fingers
did
appear
somewhat
stiffer
than
the
others,
but
with
those
gloves
it
was
hard
to
be
certain.
It
might
have
been
no
more
than
a
story.
How
would
Maddy
know?

“Lord
Petyr
has
been
kind
enough
to
let
me
keep
my
harp,”
the
blind
singer
said.
“My
harp
and...
my
tongue...
so
I
may
sing
my
songs.
Lady
Lysa
dearly
loved
my
singing...”

“Take
this
creature
away,
or
I’m
like
to
kill
him
myself,”
Lord
Nestor
growled.
“It
sickens
me
to
look
at
him.”

“Mord,
take
him
back
to
his
sky
cell,”
said
Petyr.

“Yes,
m’lord.”
Mord
grabbed
Marillion
roughly
by
the
collar.
“No
more
mouth.”
When
he
spoke,
Sansa
saw
to
her
astonishment
that
the
gaoler’s
teeth
were
made
of
gold.
They
watched
as
he
half
dragged
half
shoved
the
singer
toward
the
doors.

“The
man
must
die,”
Ser
Marywn
Belmore
declared
when
they
were
gone.
“He
should
have
followed
Lady
Lysa
out
the
Moon
Door.”

“Without
his
tongue,”
Ser
Albar
Royce
added.
“Without
that
lying,
mocking
tongue.”

“I
have
been
too
gentle
with
him,
I
know,”
Petyr
Baelish
said
in
an
apologetic
tone.
“If
truth
be
told,
I
pity
him.
He
killed
for
love.”

“For
love
or
hate,”
said
Belmore,
“he
must
die.”

“Soon
enough,”
Lord
Nestor
said
gruffly.
“No
man
lingers
long
in
the
sky
cells.
The
blue
will
call
to
him.”

“It
may,”
said
Petyr
Baelish,
“but
whether
Marillion
will
answer,
only
he
can
say.”
He
gestured,
and
his
guardsmen
opened
the
doors
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
“Sers,
I
know
you
must
be
weary
after
your
ascent.
Rooms
have
been
prepared
for
all
of
you
to
spend
the
night,
and
food
and
wine
await
you
in
the
Lower
Hall.
Oswell,
show
them
the
way,
and
see
that
they
have
all
they
need.”
He
turned
to
Nestor
Royce.
“My
lord,
will
you
join
me
in
the
solar
for
a
cup
of
wine?
Alayne,
sweetling,
come
pour
for
us.”

A
low
fire
burned
in
the
solar,
where
a
flagon
of
wine
awaited
them.
Arbor
gold.
Sansa
filled
Lord
Nestor’s
cup
whilst
Petyr
prodded
at
the
logs
with
an
iron
poker.

Lord
Nestor
seated
himself
beside
the
fire.
“This
will
not
be
the
end
of
it,”
he
said
to
Petyr,
as
if
Sansa
were
not
there.
“My
cousin
means
to
question
the
singer
himself.”

“Bronze
Yohn
mistrusts
me.”
Petyr
pushed
a
log
aside.

“He
means
to
come
in
force.
Symond
Templeton
will
join
him,
do
not
doubt
it.
And
Lady
Waynwood
too,
I
fear.”

“And
Lord
Belmore,
Young
Lord
Hunter,
Horton
Redfort.
They
will
bring
Strong
Sam
Stone,
the
Tolletts,
the
Shetts,
the
Coldwaters,
some
Corbrays.”

“You
are
well-informed.
Which
Corbrays?
Not
Lord
Lyonel?”

“No,
his
brother.
Ser
Lyn
mislikes
me,
for
some
reason.”

“Lyn
Corbray
is
a
dangerous
man,”
Lord
Nestor
said
doggedly.
“What
do
you
intend
to
do?”

“What
can
I
do
but
make
them
welcome
if
they
come?”
Petyr
gave
the
flames
another
stir
and
set
the
poker
down.

“My
cousin
means
to
remove
you
as
Lord
Protector.”

“If
so,
I
cannot
stop
him.
I
keep
a
garrison
of
twenty
men.
Lord
Royce
and
his
friends
can
raise
twenty
thousand.”
Petyr
went
to
the
oaken
chest
that
sat
beneath
the
window.
“Bronze
Yohn
will
do
what
he
will
do,”
he
said,
kneeling.
He
opened
the
chest,
drew
out
a
roll
of
parchment,
and
brought
it
to
Lord
Nestor.
“My
lord.
This
is
a
token
of
the
love
my
lady
bore
you.”

Sansa
watched
Royce
unroll
the
parchment.
“This...
this
is
unexpected,
my
lord.”
She
was
startled
to
see
tears
in
his
eyes.

“Unexpected,
but
not
undeserved.
My
lady
valued
you
above
all
her
other
bannermen.
You
were
her
rock,
she
told
me.”

“Her
rock.”
Lord
Nestor
reddened.
“She
said
that?”

“Often.
And
this”—Petyr
gestured
at
the
parchment—“is
the
proof
of
it.”

“That...
that
is
good
to
know.
Jon
Arryn
valued
my
service,
I
know,
but
Lady
Lysa...
she
scorned
me
when
I
came
to
court
her,
and
I
feared...”
Lord
Nestor
furrowed
his
brow.
“It
bears
the
Arryn
seal,
I
see,
but
the
signature...”

“Lysa
was
murdered
before
the
document
could
be
presented
for
her
signature,
so
I
signed
as
Lord
Protector.
I
knew
that
would
have
been
her
wish.”

“I
see.”
Lord
Nestor
rolled
the
parchment.
“You
are...
dutiful,
my
lord.
Aye,
and
not
without
courage.
Some
will
call
this
grant
unseemly,
and
fault
you
for
making
it.
The
Keeper’s
post
has
never
been
hereditary.
The
Arryns
raised
the
Gates,
in
the
days
when
they
still
wore
the
Falcon
Crown
and
ruled
the
Vale
as
kings.
The
Eyrie
was
their
summer
seat,
but
when
the
snows
began
to
fall
the
court
would
make
its
descent.
Some
would
say
the
Gates
were
as
royal
as
the
Eyrie.”

“There
has
been
no
king
in
the
Vale
for
three
hundred
years,”
Petyr
Baelish
pointed
out.

“The
dragons
came,”
Lord
Nestor
agreed.
“But
even
after,
the
Gates
remained
an
Arryn
castle.
Jon
Arryn
himself
was
Keeper
of
the
Gates
whilst
his
father
lived.
After
his
ascent,
he
named
his
brother
Ronnel
to
the
honor,
and
later
his
cousin
Denys.”

“Lord
Robert
has
no
brothers,
and
only
distant
cousins.”

“True.”
Lord
Nestor
clutched
the
parchment
tightly.
“I
will
not
say
I
had
not
hoped
for
this.
Whilst
Lord
Jon
ruled
the
realm
as
Hand,
it
fell
to
me
to
rule
the
Vale
for
him.
I
did
all
that
he
required
of
me
and
asked
nothing
for
myself.
But
by
the
gods,
I
earned
this!”

“You
did,”
said
Petyr,
“and
Lord
Robert
sleeps
more
easily
knowing
that
you
are
always
there,
a
staunch
friend
at
the
foot
of
his
mountain.”
He
raised
a
cup.
“So...
a
toast,
my
lord.
To
House
Royce,
Keepers
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon...
now
and
forever.”

“Now
and
forever,
aye!”
The
silver
cups
crashed
together.

Later,
much
later,
after
the
flagon
of
Arbor
gold
was
dry,
Lord
Nestor
took
his
leave
to
rejoin
his
company
of
knights.
Sansa
was
asleep
on
her
feet
by
then,
wanting
only
to
crawl
off
to
her
bed,
but
Petyr
caught
her
by
the
wrist.
“You
see
the
wonders
that
can
be
worked
with
lies
and
Arbor
gold?”

Why
did
she
feel
like
weeping?
It
was
good
that
Nestor
Royce
was
with
them.
“Were
they
all
lies?”

“Not
all.
Lysa
often
called
Lord
Nestor
a
rock,
though
I
do
not
think
she
meant
it
as
a
compliment.
She
called
his
son
a
clod.
She
knew
Lord
Nestor
dreamed
of
holding
the
Gates
in
his
own
right,
a
lord
in
truth
as
well
as
name,
but
Lysa
dreamed
of
other
sons
and
meant
the
castle
to
go
to
Robert’s
little
brother.”
He
stood.
“Do
you
understand
what
happened
here,
Alayne?”

Sansa
hesitated
a
moment.
“You
gave
Lord
Nestor
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
to
be
certain
of
his
support.”

“I
did,”
Petyr
admitted,
“but
our
rock
is
a
Royce,
which
is
to
say
he
is
overproud
and
prickly.
Had
I
asked
him
his
price,
he
would
have
swelled
up
like
an
angry
toad
at
the
slight
upon
his
honor.
But
this
way...
the
man
is
not
utterly
stupid,
but
the
lies
I
served
him
were
sweeter
than
the
truth.
He
wants
to
believe
that
Lysa
valued
him
above
her
other
bannermen.
One
of
those
others
is
Bronze
Yohn,
after
all,
and
Nestor
is
very
much
aware
that
he
was
born
of
the
lesser
branch
of
House
Royce.
He
wants
more
for
his
son.
Men
of
honor
will
do
things
for
their
children
that
they
would
never
consider
doing
for
themselves.”

She
nodded.
“The
signature...
you
might
have
had
Lord
Robert
put
his
hand
and
seal
to
it,
but
instead...”

“...I
signed
myself,
as
Lord
Protector.
Why?”

“So...
if
you
are
removed,
or...
or
killed...”

“...Lord
Nestor’s
claim
to
the
Gates
will
suddenly
be
called
into
question.
I
promise
you,
that
is
not
lost
on
him.
It
was
clever
of
you
to
see
it.
Though
no
more
than
I’d
expect
of
mine
own
daughter.”

“Thank
you.”
She
felt
absurdly
proud
for
puzzling
it
out,
but
confused
as
well.
“I’m
not,
though.
Your
daughter.
Not
truly.
I
mean,
I
pretend
to
be
Alayne,
but
you
know...”

Littlefinger
put
a
finger
to
her
lips.
“I
know
what
I
know,
and
so
do
you.
Some
things
are
best
left
unsaid,
sweetling.”

“Even
when
we
are
alone?”

“Especially
when
we
are
alone.
Elsewise
a
day
will
come
when
a
servant
walks
into
a
room
unannounced,
or
a
guardsman
at
the
door
chances
to
hear
something
he
should
not.
Do
you
want
more
blood
on
your
pretty
little
hands,
my
darling?”

Marillion’s
face
seemed
to
float
before
her,
the
bandage
pale
across
his
eyes.
Behind
him
she
could
see
Ser
Dontos,
the
crossbow
bolts
still
in
him.
“No,”
Sansa
said.
“Please.”

“I
am
tempted
to
say
this
is
no
game
we
play,
daughter,
but
of
course
it
is.
The
game
of
thrones.”

I
never
asked
to
play.
The
game
was
too
dangerous.
One
slip
and
I
am
dead.
“Oswell...
my
lord,
Oswell
rowed
me
from
King’s
Landing
the
night
that
I
escaped.
He
must
know
who
I
am.”

“If
he’s
half
as
clever
as
a
sheep
pellet,
you
would
think
so.
Ser
Lothor
knows
as
well.
But
Oswell
has
been
in
my
service
a
long
time,
and
Brune
is
close-mouthed
by
nature.
Kettleblack
watches
Brune
for
me,
and
Brune
watches
Kettleblack.
Trust
no
one,
I
once
told
Eddard
Stark,
but
he
would
not
listen.
You
are
Alayne,
and
you
must
be
Alayne
all
the
time.”
He
put
two
fingers
on
her
left
breast.
“Even
here.
In
your
heart.
Can
you
do
that?
Can
you
be
my
daughter
in
your
heart?”

“I...”
I
do
not
know,
my
lord,
she
almost
said,
but
that
was
not
what
he
wanted
to
hear.
Lies
and
Arbor
gold,
she
thought.
“I
am
Alayne,
Father.
Who
else
would
I
be?”

Lord
Littlefinger
kissed
her
cheek.
“With
my
wits
and
Cat’s
beauty,
the
world
will
be
yours,
sweetling.
Now
off
to
bed.”

Gretchel
had
laid
a
fire
in
her
hearth
and
plumped
her
featherbed.
Sansa
undressed
and
slipped
beneath
the
blankets.
He
will
not
sing
tonight,
she
prayed,
not
with
Lord
Nestor
and
the
others
in
the
castle.
He
would
not
dare.
She
closed
her
eyes.

Sometime
during
the
night
she
woke,
as
little
Robert
climbed
up
into
her
bed.
I
forgot
to
tell
Lothor
to
lock
him
in
again,
she
realized.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it,
so
she
put
her
arm
around
him.
“Sweetrobin?
You
can
stay,
but
try
not
to
squirm
around.
Just
close
your
eyes
and
sleep,
little
one.”

“I
will.”
He
cuddled
close
and
laid
his
head
between
her
breasts.
“Alayne?
Are
you
my
mother
now?”

“I
suppose
I
am,”
she
said.
If
a
lie
was
kindly
meant,
there
was
no
harm
in
it.





THE
KRAKEN’S
DAUGHTER

The
hall
was
loud
with
drunken
Harlaws,
distant
cousins
all.
Each
lord
had
hung
his
banner
behind
the
benches
where
his
men
were
seated.
Too
few,
thought
Asha
Greyjoy,
looking
down
from
the
gallery,
too
few
by
far.
The
benches
were
three-quarters
empty.

Qarl
the
Maid
had
said
as
much,
when
the
Black
Wind
was
approaching
from
the
sea.
He
had
counted
the
longships
moored
beneath
her
uncle’s
castle,
and
his
mouth
had
tightened.
“They
have
not
come,”
he
observed,
“or
not
enough
of
them.”
He
was
not
wrong,
but
Asha
could
not
agree
with
him,
out
where
her
crew
might
hear.
She
did
not
doubt
their
devotion,
but
even
ironborn
will
hesitate
to
give
their
lives
for
a
cause
that’s
plainly
lost.

Do
I
have
so
few
friends
as
this?
Amongst
the
banners,
she
saw
the
silver
fish
of
Botley,
the
stone
tree
of
the
Stonetrees,
the
black
leviathan
of
Volmark,
the
nooses
of
the
Myres.
The
rest
were
Harlaw
scythes.
Boremund
placed
his
upon
a
pale
blue
field,
Hotho’s
was
girdled
within
an
embattled
border,
and
the
Knight
had
quartered
his
with
the
gaudy
peacock
of
his
mother’s
House.
Even
Sigfryd
Silverhair
showed
two
scythes
counterchanged
on
a
field
divided
bendwise.
Only
the
Lord
Harlaw
displayed
the
silver
scythe
plain
upon
a
night-black
field,
as
it
had
flown
in
the
dawn
of
days:
Rodrik,
called
the
Reader,
Lord
of
the
Ten
Towers,
Lord
of
Harlaw,
Harlaw
of
Harlaw...
her
favorite
uncle.

Lord
Rodrik’s
high
seat
was
vacant.
Two
scythes
of
beaten
silver
crossed
above
it,
so
huge
that
even
a
giant
would
have
difficulty
wielding
them,
but
beneath
were
only
empty
cushions.
Asha
was
not
surprised.
The
feast
was
long
concluded.
Only
bones
and
greasy
platters
remained
upon
the
trestle
tables.
The
rest
was
drinking,
and
her
uncle
Rodrik
had
never
been
partial
to
the
company
of
quarrelsome
drunks.

She
turned
to
Three-Tooth,
an
old
woman
of
fearful
age
who
had
been
her
uncle’s
steward
since
she
was
known
as
Twelve-Tooth.
“My
uncle
is
with
his
books?”

“Aye,
where
else?”
The
woman
was
so
old
that
a
septon
had
once
said
she
must
have
nursed
the
Crone.
That
was
when
the
Faith
was
still
tolerated
on
the
isles.
Lord
Rodrik
had
kept
septons
at
Ten
Towers,
not
for
his
soul’s
sake
but
for
his
books.
“With
the
books,
and
Botley.
He
was
with
him
too.”

Botley’s
standard
hung
in
the
hall,
a
shoal
of
silver
fish
upon
a
pale
green
field,
though
Asha
had
not
seen
his
Swiftfin
amongst
the
other
longships.
“I
had
heard
my
nuncle
Crow’s
Eye
had
old
Sawane
Botley
drowned.”

“Lord
Tristifer
Botley,
this
one
is.”

Tris.
She
wondered
what
had
happened
to
Sawane’s
elder
son,
Harren.
I
will
find
out
soon
enough,
no
doubt.
This
should
be
awkward.
She
had
not
seen
Tris
Botley
since...
no,
she
ought
not
dwell
on
it.
“And
my
lady
mother?”

“Abed,”
said
Three-Tooth,
“in
the
Widow’s
Tower.”

Aye,
where
else?
The
widow
the
tower
was
named
after
was
her
aunt.
Lady
Gwynesse
had
come
home
to
mourn
after
her
husband
had
died
off
Fair
Isle
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
first
rebellion.
“I
will
only
stay
until
my
grief
has
passed,”
she
had
told
her
brother,
famously,
“though
by
rights
Ten
Towers
should
be
mine,
for
I
am
seven
years
your
elder.”
Long
years
had
passed
since
then,
but
still
the
widow
lingered,
grieving,
and
muttering
from
time
to
time
that
the
castle
should
be
hers.
And
now
Lord
Rodrik
has
a
second
half-mad
widowed
sister
beneath
his
roof,
Asha
reflected.
Small
wonder
if
he
seeks
solace
in
his
books.

Even
now,
it
was
hard
to
credit
that
frail,
sickly
Lady
Alannys
had
outlived
her
husband
Lord
Balon,
who
had
seemed
so
hard
and
strong.
When
Asha
had
sailed
away
to
war,
she
had
done
so
with
a
heavy
heart,
fearing
that
her
mother
might
well
die
before
she
could
return.
Not
once
had
she
thought
that
her
father
might
perish
instead.
The
Drowned
God
plays
savage
japes
upon
us
all,
but
men
are
crueler
still.
A
sudden
storm
and
a
broken
rope
had
sent
Balon
Greyjoy
to
his
death.
Or
so
they
claim.

Asha
had
last
seen
her
mother
when
she
stopped
at
Ten
Towers
to
take
on
fresh
water,
on
her
way
north
to
strike
at
Deepwood
Motte.
Alannys
Harlaw
never
had
the
sort
of
beauty
the
singers
cherished,
but
her
daughter
had
loved
her
fierce
strong
face
and
the
laughter
in
her
eyes.
On
that
last
visit,
though,
she
had
found
Lady
Alannys
in
a
window
seat
huddled
beneath
a
pile
of
furs,
staring
out
across
the
sea.
Is
this
my
mother,
or
her
ghost?
she
remembered
thinking
as
she’d
kissed
her
cheek.

Her
mother’s
skin
had
been
parchment
thin,
her
long
hair
white.
Some
pride
remained
in
the
way
she
held
her
head,
but
her
eyes
were
dim
and
cloudy,
and
her
mouth
had
trembled
when
she
asked
after
Theon.
“Did
you
bring
my
baby
boy?”
she
had
asked.
Theon
had
been
ten
years
old
when
he
was
carried
off
to
Winterfell
a
hostage,
and
so
far
as
Lady
Alannys
was
concerned
he
would
always
be
ten
years
old,
it
seemed.
“Theon
could
not
come,”
Asha
had
to
tell
her.
“Father
sent
him
reaving
along
the
Stony
Shore.”
Lady
Alannys
had
naught
to
say
to
that.
She
only
nodded
slowly,
yet
it
was
plain
to
see
how
deep
her
daughter’s
words
had
cut
her.

And
now
I
must
tell
her
that
Theon
is
dead,
and
drive
yet
another
dagger
through
her
heart.
There
were
two
knives
buried
there
already.
On
the
blades
were
writ
the
words
Rodrik
and
Maron,
and
many
a
time
they
twisted
cruelly
in
the
night.
I
will
see
her
on
the
morrow,
Asha
vowed
to
herself.
Her
journey
had
been
long
and
wearisome,
she
could
not
face
her
mother
now.

“I
must
speak
with
Lord
Rodrik,”
she
told
Three-Tooth.
“See
to
my
crew,
once
they’re
done
unloading
Black
Wind.
They’ll
bring
captives.
I
want
them
to
have
warm
beds
and
a
hot
meal.”

“There’s
cold
beef
in
the
kitchens.
And
mustard
in
a
big
stone
jar,
from
Oldtown.”
The
thought
of
that
mustard
made
the
old
woman
smile.
A
single
long
brown
tooth
poked
from
her
gums.

“That
will
not
serve.
We
had
a
rough
crossing.
I
want
something
hot
in
their
bellies.”
Asha
hooked
a
thumb
through
the
studded
belt
about
her
hips.
“Lady
Glover
and
the
children
should
not
want
for
wood
nor
warmth.
Put
them
in
some
tower,
not
the
dungeons.
The
babe
is
sick.”

“Babes
are
often
sick.
Most
die,
and
folks
are
sorry.
I
shall
ask
my
lord
where
to
put
these
wolf
folk.”

She
caught
the
woman’s
nose
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
pinched.
“You
will
do
as
I
say.
And
if
this
babe
dies,
no
one
will
be
sorrier
than
you.”
Three-Tooth
squealed
and
promised
to
obey,
till
Asha
let
her
loose
and
went
to
find
her
uncle.

It
was
good
to
walk
these
halls
again.
Ten
Towers
had
always
felt
like
home
to
Asha,
more
so
than
Pyke.
Not
one
castle,
ten
castles
squashed
together,
she
had
thought,
the
first
time
she
had
seen
it.
She
remembered
breathless
races
up
and
down
the
steps
and
along
wallwalks
and
covered
bridges,
fishing
off
the
Long
Stone
Quay,
days
and
nights
lost
amongst
her
uncle’s
wealth
of
books.
His
grandfather’s
grandfather
had
raised
the
castle,
the
newest
on
the
isles.
Lord
Theomore
Harlaw
had
lost
three
sons
in
the
cradle
and
laid
the
blame
upon
the
flooded
cellars,
damp
stones,
and
festering
nitre
of
ancient
Harlaw
Hall.
Ten
Towers
was
airier,
more
comfortable,
better
sited...
but
Lord
Theomore
was
a
changeable
man,
as
any
of
his
wives
might
have
testified.
He’d
had
six
of
those,
as
dissimilar
as
his
ten
towers.

The
Book
Tower
was
the
fattest
of
the
ten,
octagonal
in
shape
and
made
with
great
blocks
of
hewn
stone.
The
stair
was
built
within
the
thickness
of
the
walls.
Asha
climbed
quickly,
to
the
fifth
story
and
the
room
where
her
uncle
read.
Not
that
there
are
any
rooms
where
he
does
not
read.
Lord
Rodrik
was
seldom
seen
without
a
book
in
hand,
be
it
in
the
privy,
on
the
deck
of
his
Sea
Song,
or
whilst
holding
audience.
Asha
had
oft
seen
him
reading
on
his
high
seat
beneath
the
silver
scythes.
He
would
listen
to
each
case
as
it
was
laid
before
him,
pronounce
his
judgment...
and
read
a
bit
whilst
his
captain-of-guards
went
to
bring
in
the
next
supplicant.

She
found
him
hunched
over
a
table
by
a
window,
surrounded
by
parchment
scrolls
that
might
have
come
from
Valyria
before
its
Doom,
and
heavy
leather-bound
books
with
bronze-and-iron
hasps.
Beeswax
candles
as
thick
and
tall
as
a
man’s
arm
burned
on
either
side
of
where
he
sat,
on
ornate
iron
holders.
Lord
Rodrik
Harlaw
was
neither
fat
nor
slim;
neither
tall
nor
short;
neither
ugly
nor
handsome.
His
hair
was
brown,
as
were
his
eyes,
though
the
short,
neat
beard
he
favored
had
gone
grey.
All
in
all,
he
was
an
ordinary
man,
distinguished
only
by
his
love
of
written
words,
which
so
many
ironborn
found
unmanly
and
perverse.

“Nuncle.”
She
closed
the
door
behind
her.
“What
reading
was
so
urgent
that
you
leave
your
guests
without
a
host?”

“Archmaester
Marwyn’s
Book
of
Lost
Books.”
He
lifted
his
gaze
from
the
page
to
study
her.
“Hotho
brought
me
a
copy
from
Oldtown.
He
has
a
daughter
he
would
have
me
wed.”
Lord
Rodrik
tapped
the
book
with
a
long
nail.
“See
here?
Marwyn
claims
to
have
found
three
pages
of
Signs
and
Portents,
visions
written
down
by
the
maiden
daughter
of
Aenar
Targaryen
before
the
Doom
came
to
Valyria.
Does
Lanny
know
that
you
are
here?”

“Not
as
yet.”
Lanny
was
his
pet
name
for
her
mother;
only
the
Reader
called
her
that.
“Let
her
rest.”
Asha
moved
a
stack
of
books
off
a
stool
and
seated
herself.
“Three-Tooth
seems
to
have
lost
two
more
of
her
teeth.
Do
you
call
her
One-Tooth
now?”

“I
seldom
call
her
at
all.
The
woman
frightens
me.
What
hour
is
it?”
Lord
Rodrik
glanced
out
the
window,
at
the
moonlit
sea.
“Dark,
so
soon?
I
had
not
noticed.
You
come
late.
We
looked
for
you
some
days
ago.”

“The
winds
were
against
us,
and
I
had
captives
to
concern
me.
Robett
Glover’s
wife
and
children.
The
youngest
is
still
at
the
breast,
and
Lady
Glover’s
milk
dried
up
during
our
crossing.
I
had
no
choice
but
to
beach
Black
Wind
upon
the
Stony
Shore
and
send
my
men
out
to
find
a
wet
nurse.
They
found
a
goat
instead.
The
girl
does
not
thrive.
Is
there
a
nursing
mother
in
the
village?
Deepwood
is
important
to
my
plans.”

“Your
plans
must
change.
You
come
too
late.”

“Late
and
hungry.”
She
stretched
her
long
legs
out
beneath
the
table
and
turned
the
pages
of
the
nearest
book,
a
septon’s
discourse
on
Maegor
the
Cruel’s
war
against
the
Poor
Fellows.
“Oh,
and
thirsty
too.
A
horn
of
ale
would
go
down
well,
Nuncle.”

Lord
Rodrik
pursed
his
lips.
“You
know
I
do
not
permit
food
nor
drink
in
my
library.
The
books—”

“—might
suffer
harm.”
Asha
laughed.

Her
uncle
frowned.
“You
do
like
to
provoke
me.”

“Oh,
don’t
look
so
aggrieved.
I
have
never
met
a
man
I
didn’t
provoke,
you
should
know
that
well
enough
by
now.
But
enough
of
me.
You
are
well?”

He
shrugged.
“Well
enough.
My
eyes
grow
weaker.
I
have
sent
to
Myr
for
a
lens
to
help
me
read.”

“And
how
fares
my
aunt?”

Lord
Rodrik
sighed.
“Still
seven
years
my
elder,
and
convinced
Ten
Towers
should
be
hers.
Gwynesse
grows
forgetful,
but
that
she
does
not
forget.
She
mourns
for
her
dead
husband
as
deeply
as
she
did
the
day
he
died,
though
she
cannot
always
recall
his
name.”

“I
am
not
certain
she
ever
knew
his
name.”
Asha
closed
the
septon’s
book
with
a
thump.
“Was
my
father
murdered?”

“So
your
mother
believes.”

There
were
times
when
she
would
gladly
have
murdered
him
herself,
she
thought.
“And
what
does
my
nuncle
believe?”

“Balon
fell
to
his
death
when
a
rope
bridge
broke
beneath
him.
A
storm
was
rising,
and
the
bridge
was
swaying
and
twisting
with
each
gust
of
wind.”
Rodrik
shrugged.
“Or
so
we
are
told.
Your
mother
had
a
bird
from
Maester
Wendamyr.”

Asha
slid
her
dirk
out
of
its
sheath
and
began
to
clean
the
dirt
from
beneath
her
fingernails.
“Three
years
away,
and
the
Crow’s
Eye
returns
the
very
day
my
father
dies.”

“The
day
after,
we
had
heard.
Silence
was
still
out
to
sea
when
Balon
died,
or
so
it
is
claimed.
Even
so,
I
will
agree
that
Euron’s
return
was...
timely,
shall
we
say?”

“That
is
not
how
I
would
say
it.”
Asha
slammed
the
point
of
the
dirk
into
the
table.
“Where
are
my
ships?
I
counted
twoscore
longships
moored
below,
not
near
enough
to
throw
the
Crow’s
Eye
off
my
father’s
chair.”

“I
sent
the
summons.
In
your
name,
for
the
love
I
bear
you
and
your
mother.
House
Harlaw
has
gathered.
Stonetree
as
well,
and
Volmark.
Some
Myres...”

“All
from
the
isle
of
Harlaw...
one
isle
out
of
seven.
I
saw
one
lonely
Botley
banner
in
the
hall,
from
Pyke.
Where
are
the
ships
from
Saltcliffe,
from
Orkwood,
from
the
Wyks?”

“Baelor
Blacktyde
came
from
Blacktyde
to
consult
with
me,
and
just
as
soon
set
sail
again.”
Lord
Rodrik
closed
The
Book
of
Lost
Books.
“He
is
on
Old
Wyk
by
now.”

“Old
Wyk?”
Asha
had
feared
he
was
about
to
say
that
they
all
had
gone
to
Pyke,
to
do
homage
to
the
Crow’s
Eye.
“Why
Old
Wyk?”

“I
thought
you
would
have
heard.
Aeron
Damphair
has
called
a
kingsmoot.”

Asha
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed.
“The
Drowned
God
must
have
shoved
a
pricklefish
up
Uncle
Aeron’s
arse.
A
kingsmoot?
Is
this
some
jape,
or
does
he
mean
it
truly?”

“The
Damphair
has
not
japed
since
he
was
drowned.
And
the
other
priests
have
taken
up
the
call.
Blind
Beron
Blacktyde,
Tarle
the
Thrice-Drowned...
even
the
Old
Grey
Gull
has
left
that
rock
he
lives
on
to
preach
this
kingsmoot
all
across
Harlaw.
The
captains
are
gathering
on
Old
Wyk
as
we
speak.”

Asha
was
astonished.
“Has
the
Crow’s
Eye
agreed
to
attend
this
holy
farce
and
abide
by
its
decision?”

“The
Crow’s
Eye
does
not
confide
in
me.
Since
he
summoned
me
to
Pyke
to
do
him
homage,
I
have
had
no
word
from
Euron.”

A
kingsmoot.
This
is
something
new...
or
rather,
something
very
old.
“And
my
uncle
Victarion?
What
does
he
make
of
the
Damphair’s
notion?”

“Victarion
was
sent
word
of
your
father’s
death.
And
of
this
kingsmoot
too,
I
do
not
doubt.
Beyond
that,
I
cannot
say.”

Better
a
kingsmoot
than
a
war.
“I
believe
I’ll
kiss
the
Damphair’s
smelly
feet
and
pluck
the
seaweed
from
out
between
his
toes.”
Asha
wrenched
loose
her
dirk
and
sheathed
it
once
again.
“A
bloody
kingsmoot!”

“On
Old
Wyk,”
confirmed
Lord
Rodrik.
“Though
I
pray
it
is
not
bloody.
I
have
been
consulting
Haereg’s
History
of
the
Ironborn.
When
last
the
salt
kings
and
the
rock
kings
met
in
kingsmoot,
Urron
of
Orkmont
let
his
axemen
loose
among
them,
and
Nagga’s
ribs
turned
red
with
gore.
House
Greyiron
ruled
unchosen
for
a
thousand
years
from
that
dark
day,
until
the
Andals
came.”

“You
must
lend
me
Haereg’s
book,
Nuncle.”
She
would
need
to
learn
all
she
could
of
kingsmoots
before
she
reached
Old
Wyk.

“You
may
read
it
here.
It
is
old
and
fragile.”
He
studied
her,
frowning.
“Archmaester
Rigney
once
wrote
that
history
is
a
wheel,
for
the
nature
of
man
is
fundamentally
unchanging.
What
has
happened
before
will
perforce
happen
again,
he
said.
I
think
of
that
whenever
I
contemplate
the
Crow’s
Eye.
Euron
Greyjoy
sounds
queerly
like
Urron
Greyiron
to
these
old
ears.
I
shall
not
go
to
Old
Wyk.
Nor
should
you.”

Asha
smiled.
“And
miss
the
first
kingsmoot
called
in...
how
long
has
it
been,
Nuncle?”

“Four
thousand
years,
if
Haereg
can
be
believed.
Half
that,
if
you
accept
Maester
Denestan’s
arguments
in
Questions.
Going
to
Old
Wyk
serves
no
purpose.
This
dream
of
kingship
is
a
madness
in
our
blood.
I
told
your
father
so
the
first
time
he
rose,
and
it
is
more
true
now
than
it
was
then.
It’s
land
we
need,
not
crowns.
With
Stannis
Baratheon
and
Tywin
Lannister
contending
for
the
Iron
Throne,
we
have
a
rare
chance
to
improve
our
lot.
Let
us
take
one
side
or
the
other,
help
them
to
victory
with
our
fleets,
and
claim
the
lands
we
need
from
a
grateful
king.”

“That
might
be
worth
some
thought,
once
I
sit
the
Seastone
Chair,”
said
Asha.

Her
uncle
sighed.
“You
will
not
want
to
hear
this,
Asha,
but
you
will
not
be
chosen.
No
woman
has
ever
ruled
the
ironborn.
Gwynesse
is
seven
years
my
elder,
but
when
our
father
died
the
Ten
Towers
came
to
me.
It
will
be
the
same
for
you.
You
are
Balon’s
daughter,
not
his
son.
And
you
have
three
uncles.”

“Four.”

“Three
kraken
uncles.
I
do
not
count.”

“You
do
with
me.
So
long
as
I
have
my
nuncle
of
Ten
Towers,
I
have
Harlaw.”
Harlaw
was
not
the
largest
of
the
Iron
Islands,
but
it
was
the
richest
and
most
populous,
and
Lord
Rodrik’s
power
was
not
to
be
despised.
On
Harlaw,
Harlaw
had
no
rival.
The
Volmarks
and
Stonetrees
had
large
holdings
on
the
isle
and
boasted
famous
captains
and
fierce
warriors
of
their
own,
but
even
the
fiercest
bent
beneath
the
scythe.
The
Kennings
and
the
Myres,
once
bitter
foes,
had
long
ago
been
beaten
down
to
vassals.

“My
cousins
do
me
fealty,
and
in
war
I
should
command
their
swords
and
sails.
In
kingsmoot,
though...”
Lord
Rodrik
shook
his
head.
“Beneath
the
bones
of
Nagga
every
captain
stands
as
equal.
Some
may
shout
your
name,
I
do
not
doubt
it.
But
not
enough.
And
when
the
shouts
ring
out
for
Victarion
or
the
Crow’s
Eye,
some
of
those
now
drinking
in
my
hall
will
join
the
rest.
I
say
again,
do
not
sail
into
this
storm.
Your
fight
is
hopeless.”

“No
fight
is
hopeless
till
it
has
been
fought.
I
have
the
best
claim.
I
am
the
heir
of
Balon’s
body.”

“You
are
still
a
willful
child.
Think
of
your
poor
mother.
You
are
all
that
Lanny
has
left
to
her.
I
will
put
a
torch
to
Black
Wind
if
need
be,
to
keep
you
here.”

“What,
and
make
me
swim
to
Old
Wyk?”

“A
long
cold
swim,
for
a
crown
you
cannot
keep.
Your
father
had
more
courage
than
sense.
The
Old
Way
served
the
isles
well
when
we
were
one
small
kingdom
amongst
many,
but
Aegon’s
Conquest
put
an
end
to
that.
Balon
refused
to
see
what
was
plain
before
him.
The
Old
Way
died
with
Black
Harren
and
his
sons.”

“I
know
that.”
Asha
had
loved
her
father,
but
she
did
not
delude
herself.
Balon
had
been
blind
in
some
respects.
A
brave
man
but
a
bad
lord.
“Does
that
mean
we
must
live
and
die
as
thralls
to
the
Iron
Throne?
If
there
are
rocks
to
starboard
and
a
storm
to
port,
a
wise
captain
steers
a
third
course.”

“Show
me
this
third
course.”

“I
shall...
at
my
queensmoot.
Nuncle,
how
can
you
even
think
of
not
attending?
This
will
be
history,
alive...”

“I
prefer
my
history
dead.
Dead
history
is
writ
in
ink,
the
living
sort
in
blood.”

“Do
you
want
to
die
old
and
craven
in
your
bed?”

“How
else?
Though
not
till
I’m
done
reading.”
Lord
Rodrik
went
to
the
window.
“You
have
not
asked
about
your
lady
mother.”

I
was
afraid.
“How
is
she?”

“Stronger.
She
may
yet
outlive
us
all.
She
will
certainly
outlive
you,
if
you
persist
in
this
folly.
She
eats
more
than
she
did
when
she
first
came
here,
and
oft
sleeps
through
the
night.”

“Good.”
In
her
final
years
on
Pyke,
Lady
Alannys
could
not
sleep.
She
would
wander
the
halls
at
night
with
a
candle,
looking
for
her
sons.
“Maron?”
she
would
call
shrilly.
“Rodrik,
where
are
you?
Theon,
my
baby,
come
to
Mother.”
Many
a
time
Asha
had
watched
the
maester
draw
splinters
from
her
mother’s
heels
of
a
morning,
after
she
had
crossed
the
swaying
plank
bridge
to
the
Sea
Tower
on
bare
feet.
“I
will
see
her
in
the
morning.”

“She
will
ask
for
word
of
Theon.”

The
Prince
of
Winterfell.
“What
have
you
told
her?”

“Little
and
less.
There
was
naught
to
tell.”
He
hesitated.
“You
are
certain
that
he
is
dead?”

“I
am
certain
of
nothing.”

“You
found
a
body?”

“We
found
parts
of
many
bodies.
The
wolves
were
there
before
us...
the
four-legged
sort,
but
they
showed
scant
reverence
for
their
two-legged
kin.
The
bones
of
the
slain
were
scattered,
cracked
open
for
their
marrow.
I
confess,
it
was
hard
to
know
what
happened
there.
It
seemed
as
though
the
northmen
fought
amongst
themselves.”

“Crows
will
fight
over
a
dead
man’s
flesh
and
kill
each
other
for
his
eyes.”
Lord
Rodrik
stared
across
the
sea,
watching
the
play
of
moonlight
on
the
waves.
“We
had
one
king,
then
five.
Now
all
I
see
are
crows,
squabbling
over
the
corpse
of
Westeros.”
He
fastened
the
shutters.
“Do
not
go
to
Old
Wyk,
Asha.
Stay
with
your
mother.
We
shall
not
have
her
long,
I
fear.”

Asha
shifted
in
her
seat.
“My
mother
raised
me
to
be
bold.
If
I
do
not
go,
I
will
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
wondering
what
might
have
happened
if
I
had.”

“If
you
do
go,
the
rest
of
your
life
may
be
too
short
for
wondering.”

“Better
that
than
fill
the
remainder
of
my
days
complaining
that
the
Seastone
Chair
by
rights
was
mine.
I
am
no
Gwynesse.”

That
made
him
wince.
“Asha,
my
two
tall
sons
fed
the
crabs
of
Fair
Isle.
I
am
not
like
to
wed
again.
Stay,
and
I
shall
name
you
heir
to
the
Ten
Towers.
Be
content
with
that.”

“Ten
Towers?”
Would
that
I
could.
“Your
cousins
will
not
like
that.
The
Knight,
old
Sigfryd,
Hotho
Humpback...”

“They
have
lands
and
seats
of
their
own.”

True
enough.
Damp,
decaying
Harlaw
Hall
belonged
to
old
Sigfryd
Harlaw
the
Silverhair;
humpbacked
Hotho
Harlaw
had
his
seat
at
the
Tower
of
Glimmering,
on
a
crag
above
the
western
coast.
The
Knight,
Ser
Harras
Harlaw,
kept
court
at
Grey
Garden;
Boremund
the
Blue
ruled
atop
Harridan
Hill.
But
each
was
subject
to
Lord
Rodrik.
“Boremund
has
three
sons,
Sigfryd
Silverhair
has
grandsons,
and
Hotho
has
ambitions,”
Asha
said.
“They
all
mean
to
follow
you,
even
Sigfryd.
That
one
intends
to
live
forever.”

“The
Knight
will
be
the
Lord
of
Harlaw
after
me,”
her
uncle
said,
“but
he
can
rule
from
Grey
Garden
as
easily
as
from
here.
Do
fealty
to
him
for
the
castle
and
Ser
Harras
will
protect
you.”

“I
can
protect
myself.
Nuncle,
I
am
a
kraken.
Asha,
of
House
Greyjoy.”
She
pushed
to
her
feet.
“It’s
my
father’s
seat
I
want,
not
yours.
Those
scythes
of
yours
look
perilous.
One
could
fall
and
slice
my
head
off.
No,
I’ll
sit
the
Seastone
Chair.”

“Then
you
are
just
another
crow,
screaming
for
carrion.”
Rodrik
sat
again
behind
his
table.
“Go.
I
wish
to
return
to
Archmaester
Marwyn
and
his
search.”

“Let
me
know
if
he
should
find
another
page.”
Her
uncle
was
her
uncle.
He
would
never
change.
But
he
will
come
to
Old
Wyk,
no
matter
what
he
says.

By
now
her
crew
would
be
eating
in
the
hall.
Asha
knew
she
ought
to
join
them,
to
speak
of
this
gathering
on
Old
Wyk
and
what
it
meant
for
them.
Her
own
men
would
be
solidly
behind
her,
but
she
would
need
the
rest
as
well,
her
Harlaw
cousins,
the
Volmarks,
and
the
Stonetrees.
Those
are
the
ones
I
must
win.
Her
victory
at
Deepwood
Motte
would
serve
her
in
good
stead,
once
her
men
began
to
boast
of
it,
as
she
knew
they
would.
The
crew
of
her
Black
Wind
took
a
perverse
pride
in
the
deeds
of
their
woman
captain.
Half
of
them
loved
her
like
a
daughter,
and
other
half
wanted
to
spread
her
legs,
but
either
sort
would
die
for
her.
And
I
for
them,
she
was
thinking
as
she
shouldered
through
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps,
into
the
moonlit
yard.

“Asha?”
A
shadow
stepped
out
from
behind
the
well.

Her
hand
went
to
her
dirk
at
once...
until
the
moonlight
transformed
the
dark
shape
into
a
man
in
a
sealskin
cloak.
Another
ghost.
“Tris.
I’d
thought
to
find
you
in
the
hall.”

“I
wanted
to
see
you.”

“What
part
of
me,
I
wonder?”
She
grinned.
“Well,
here
I
stand,
all
grown
up.
Look
all
you
like.”

“A
woman.”
He
moved
closer.
“And
beautiful.”

Tristifer
Botley
had
filled
out
since
last
she’d
seen
him,
but
he
had
the
same
unruly
hair
that
she
remembered,
and
eyes
as
large
and
trusting
as
a
seal’s.
Sweet
eyes,
truly.
That
was
the
trouble
with
poor
Tristifer;
he
was
too
sweet
for
the
Iron
Islands.
His
face
has
grown
comely,
she
thought.
As
a
boy
Tris
had
been
much
troubled
by
pimples.
Asha
had
suffered
the
same
affliction;
perhaps
that
had
been
what
drew
them
together.

“I
was
sorry
to
hear
about
your
father,”
she
told
him.

“I
grieve
for
yours.”

Why?
Asha
almost
asked.
It
was
Balon
who’d
sent
the
boy
away
from
Pyke,
to
be
a
ward
of
Baelor
Blacktyde’s.
“Is
it
true
you
are
Lord
Botley
now?”

“In
name,
at
least.
Harren
died
at
Moat
Cailin.
One
of
the
bog
devils
shot
him
with
a
poisoned
arrow.
But
I
am
the
lord
of
nothing.
When
my
father
denied
his
claim
to
the
Seastone
Chair,
the
Crow’s
Eye
drowned
him
and
made
my
uncles
swear
him
fealty.
Even
after
that
he
gave
half
my
father’s
lands
to
Iron
Holt.
Lord
Wynch
was
the
first
man
to
bend
his
knee
and
call
him
king.”

House
Wynch
was
strong
on
Pyke,
but
Asha
took
care
not
to
let
her
dismay
show.
“Wynch
never
had
your
father’s
courage.”

“Your
uncle
bought
him,”
Tris
said.
“The
Silence
returned
with
holds
full
of
treasure.
Plate
and
pearls,
emeralds
and
rubies,
sapphires
big
as
eggs,
bags
of
coin
so
heavy
that
no
man
can
lift
them...
the
Crow’s
Eye
has
been
buying
friends
at
every
hand.
My
uncle
Germund
calls
himself
Lord
Botley
now,
and
rules
in
Lordsport
as
your
uncle’s
man.”

“You
are
the
rightful
Lord
Botley,”
she
assured
him.
“Once
I
hold
the
Seastone
Chair,
your
father’s
lands
shall
be
restored.”

“If
you
like.
It’s
nought
to
me.
You
look
so
lovely
in
the
moonlight,
Asha.
A
woman
grown
now,
but
I
remember
when
you
were
a
skinny
girl
with
a
face
all
full
of
pimples.”

Why
must
they
always
mention
the
pimples?
“I
remember
that
as
well.”
Though
not
as
fondly
as
you
do.
Of
the
five
boys
her
mother
had
brought
to
Pyke
to
foster
after
Ned
Stark
had
taken
her
last
living
son
as
hostage,
Tris
had
been
closest
to
Asha
in
age.
He
had
not
been
the
first
boy
she
had
ever
kissed,
but
he
was
the
first
to
undo
the
laces
of
her
jerkin
and
slip
a
sweaty
hand
beneath
to
feel
her
budding
breasts.

I
would
have
let
him
feel
more
than
that
if
he’d
been
bold
enough.
Her
first
flowering
had
come
upon
her
during
the
war
and
wakened
her
desire,
but
even
before
that
Asha
had
been
curious.
He
was
there,
he
was
mine
own
age,
and
he
was
willing,
that
was
all
it
was...
that,
and
the
moon
blood.
Even
so,
she’d
called
it
love,
till
Tris
began
to
go
on
about
the
children
she
would
bear
him;
a
dozen
sons
at
least,
and
oh,
some
daughters
too.
“I
don’t
want
to
have
a
dozen
sons,”
she
had
told
him,
appalled.
“I
want
to
have
adventures.”
Not
long
after,
Maester
Qalen
found
them
at
their
play,
and
young
Tristifer
Botley
was
sent
away
to
Blacktyde.

“I
wrote
you
letters,”
he
said,
“but
Maester
Joseran
would
not
send
them.
Once
I
gave
a
stag
to
an
oarsman
on
a
trader
bound
for
Lordsport,
who
promised
to
put
my
letter
in
your
hands.”

“Your
oarsman
winkled
you
and
threw
your
letter
in
the
sea.”

“I
feared
as
much.
They
never
gave
me
your
letters
either.”

I
wrote
none.
In
truth,
she
had
been
relieved
when
Tris
was
sent
away.
By
then
his
fumblings
had
begun
to
bore
her.
That
was
not
something
he
would
care
to
hear,
however.
“Aeron
Damphair
has
called
a
kingsmoot.
Will
you
come
and
speak
for
me?”

“I
will
go
anywhere
with
you,
but...
Lord
Blacktyde
says
this
kingsmoot
is
a
dangerous
folly.
He
thinks
your
uncle
will
descend
on
them
and
kill
them
all,
as
Urron
did.”

He’s
mad
enough.
“He
lacks
the
strength.”

“You
do
not
know
his
strength.
He’s
been
gathering
men
on
Pyke.
Orkwood
of
Orkmont
brought
him
twenty
longships,
and
Pinchface
Jon
Myre
a
dozen.
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd
is
with
them.
And
Harren
Half-Hoare,
the
Red
Oarsman,
Kemmett
Pyke
the
Bastard,
Rodrik
Freeborn,
Torwold
Browntooth...”

“Men
of
small
account.”
Asha
knew
them,
every
one.
“The
sons
of
salt
wives,
the
grandsons
of
thralls.
The
Codds...
do
you
know
their
words?”

“Though
All
Men
Do
Despise
Us,”
Tris
said,
“but
if
they
catch
you
in
those
nets
of
theirs,
you’ll
be
as
dead
as
if
they
had
been
dragonlords.
And
there’s
worse.
The
Crow’s
Eye
brought
back
monsters
from
the
east...
aye,
and
wizards
too.”

“Nuncle
always
had
a
fondness
for
freaks
and
fools,”
said
Asha.
“My
father
used
to
fight
with
him
about
it.
Let
the
wizards
call
upon
their
gods.
The
Damphair
will
call
on
ours,
and
drown
them.
Will
I
have
your
voice
at
the
queensmoot,
Tris?”

“You
shall
have
all
of
me.
I
am
your
man,
forever.
Asha,
I
would
wed
you.
Your
lady
mother
has
given
her
consent.”

She
stifled
a
groan.
You
might
have
asked
me
first...
though
you
might
not
have
liked
the
answer
half
so
well.

“I
am
no
second
son
now,”
he
went
on.
“I
am
the
rightful
Lord
Botley,
as
you
said
yourself.
And
you
are—”

“What
I
am
will
be
settled
on
Old
Wyk.
Tris,
we
are
no
longer
children
fumbling
at
each
other
and
trying
to
see
what
fits
where.
You
think
you
want
to
wed
me,
but
you
don’t.”

“I
do.
All
I
dream
about
is
you.
Asha,
I
swear
upon
the
bones
of
Nagga,
I
have
never
touched
another
woman.”

“Go
touch
one...
or
two,
or
ten.
I
have
touched
more
men
than
I
can
count.
Some
with
my
lips,
more
with
my
axe.”
She
had
surrendered
her
virtue
at
six-and-ten,
to
a
beautiful
blond-haired
sailor
on
a
trading
galley
up
from
Lys.
He
only
knew
six
words
of
the
Common
Tongue,
but
“fuck”
was
one
of
them—the
very
word
she’d
hoped
to
hear.
Afterward,
Asha
had
the
sense
to
find
a
woods
witch,
who
showed
her
how
to
brew
moon
tea
to
keep
her
belly
flat.

Botley
blinked,
as
if
he
did
not
quite
understand
what
she
had
said.
“You...
I
thought
you
would
wait.
Why...”
He
rubbed
his
mouth.
“Asha,
were
you
forced?”

“So
forced
I
tore
his
tunic.
You
do
not
want
to
wed
me,
take
my
word
on
that.
You
are
a
sweet
boy
and
always
were,
but
I
am
no
sweet
girl.
If
we
wed,
soon
enough
you’d
come
to
hate
me.”

“Never.
Asha,
I
have
ached
for
you.”

She
had
heard
enough
of
this.
A
sickly
mother,
a
murdered
father,
and
a
plague
of
uncles
were
enough
for
any
woman
to
contend
with;
she
did
not
require
a
lovesick
puppy
too.
“Find
a
brothel,
Tris.
They’ll
cure
you
of
that
ache.”

“I
could
never...”
Tristifer
shook
his
head.
“You
and
I
were
meant
to
be,
Asha.
I
have
always
known
you
would
be
my
wife,
and
the
mother
of
my
sons.”
He
seized
her
upper
arm.

In
a
blink
her
dirk
was
at
his
throat.
“Take
your
hand
away
or
you
won’t
live
long
enough
to
breed
a
son.
Now.”
When
he
did,
she
lowered
the
blade.
“You
want
a
woman,
well
and
good.
I’ll
put
one
in
your
bed
tonight.
Pretend
she’s
me,
if
that
will
give
you
pleasure,
but
do
not
presume
to
grab
at
me
again.
I
am
your
queen,
not
your
wife.
Remember
that.”
Asha
sheathed
her
dirk
and
left
him
standing
there,
with
a
fat
drop
of
blood
slowly
creeping
down
his
neck,
black
in
the
pale
light
of
the
moon.





CERSEI

“Oh,
I
pray
the
Seven
will
not
let
it
rain
upon
the
king’s
wedding,”
Jocelyn
Swyft
said
as
she
laced
up
the
queen’s
gown.

“No
one
wants
rain,”
said
Cersei.
For
herself,
she
wanted
sleet
and
ice,
howling
winds,
thunder
to
shake
the
very
stones
of
the
Red
Keep.
She
wanted
a
storm
to
match
her
rage.
To
Jocelyn
she
said,
“Tighter.
Cinch
it
tighter,
you
simpering
little
fool.”

It
was
the
wedding
that
enraged
her,
though
the
slow-witted
Swyft
girl
made
a
safer
target.
Tommen’s
hold
upon
the
Iron
Throne
was
not
secure
enough
for
her
to
risk
offending
Highgarden.
Not
so
long
as
Stannis
Baratheon
held
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End,
so
long
as
Riverrun
continued
in
defiance,
so
long
as
ironmen
prowled
the
seas
like
wolves.
So
Jocelyn
must
needs
eat
the
meal
Cersei
would
sooner
have
served
to
Margaery
Tyrell
and
her
hideous
wrinkled
grandmother.

To
break
her
fast
the
queen
sent
to
the
kitchens
for
two
boiled
eggs,
a
loaf
of
bread,
and
a
pot
of
honey.
But
when
she
cracked
the
first
egg
and
found
a
bloody
half-formed
chick
inside,
her
stomach
roiled.
“Take
this
away
and
bring
me
hot
spiced
wine,”
she
told
Senelle.
The
chill
in
the
air
was
settling
in
her
bones,
and
she
had
a
long
nasty
day
ahead
of
her.

Nor
did
Jaime
help
her
mood
when
he
turned
up
all
in
white
and
still
unshaven,
to
tell
her
how
he
meant
to
keep
her
son
from
being
poisoned.
“I
will
have
men
in
the
kitchens
watching
as
each
dish
is
prepared,”
he
said.
“Ser
Addam’s
gold
cloaks
will
escort
the
servants
as
they
bring
the
food
to
table,
to
make
certain
no
tampering
takes
place
along
the
way.
Ser
Boros
will
be
tasting
every
course
before
Tommen
puts
a
bite
into
his
mouth.
And
if
all
that
should
fail,
Maester
Ballabar
will
be
seated
in
the
back
of
the
hall,
with
purges
and
antidotes
for
twenty
common
poisons
on
his
person.
Tommen
will
be
safe,
I
promise
you.”

“Safe.”
The
word
tasted
bitter
on
her
tongue.
Jaime
did
not
understand.
No
one
understood.
Only
Melara
had
been
in
the
tent
to
hear
the
old
hag’s
croaking
threats,
and
Melara
was
long
dead.
“Tyrion
will
not
kill
the
same
way
twice.
He
is
too
cunning
for
that.
He
could
be
under
the
floor
even
now,
listening
to
every
word
we
say
and
making
plans
to
open
Tommen’s
throat.”

“Suppose
he
was,”
said
Jaime.
“Whatever
plans
he
makes,
he
will
still
be
small
and
stunted.
Tommen
will
be
surrounded
by
the
finest
knights
in
Westeros.
The
Kingsguard
will
protect
him.”

Cersei
glanced
at
where
the
sleeve
of
her
brother’s
white
silk
tunic
had
been
pinned
up
over
his
stump.
“I
remember
how
well
they
guarded
Joffrey,
these
splendid
knights
of
yours.
I
want
you
to
remain
with
Tommen
all
night,
is
that
understood?”

“I
will
have
a
guardsman
outside
his
door.”

She
seized
his
arm.
“Not
a
guardsman.
You.
And
inside
his
bedchamber.”

“In
case
Tyrion
crawls
out
of
the
hearth?
He
won’t.”

“So
you
say.
Will
you
tell
me
that
you
found
all
the
hidden
tunnels
in
these
walls?”
They
both
knew
better.
“I
will
not
have
Tommen
alone
with
Margaery,
not
for
so
much
as
half
a
heartbeat.”

“They
will
not
be
alone.
Her
cousins
will
be
with
them.”

“As
will
you.
I
command
it,
in
the
king’s
name.”
Cersei
had
not
wanted
Tommen
and
his
wife
to
share
a
bed
at
all,
but
the
Tyrells
had
insisted.
“Husband
and
wife
should
sleep
together,”
the
Queen
of
Thorns
had
said,
“even
if
they
do
no
more
than
sleep.
His
Grace’s
bed
is
big
enough
for
two,
surely.”
Lady
Alerie
had
echoed
her
good-mother.
“Let
the
children
warm
each
other
in
the
night.
It
will
bring
them
closer.
Margaery
oft
shares
her
blankets
with
her
cousins.
They
sing
and
play
games
and
whisper
secrets
to
each
other
when
the
candles
are
snuffed
out.”

“How
delightful,”
Cersei
had
said.
“Let
them
continue,
by
all
means.
In
the
Maidenvault.”

“I
am
sure
Her
Grace
knows
best,”
Lady
Olenna
had
said
to
Lady
Alerie.
“She
is
the
boy’s
own
mother,
after
all,
of
that
we
are
all
sure.
And
surely
we
can
agree
about
the
wedding
night?
A
man
should
not
sleep
apart
from
his
wife
on
the
night
of
their
wedding.
It
is
ill
luck
for
their
marriage
if
they
do.”

Someday
I
will
teach
you
the
meaning
of
“ill
luck,”
the
queen
had
vowed.
“Margaery
may
share
Tommen’s
bedchamber
for
that
one
night,”
she
had
been
forced
to
say.
“No
longer.”

“Your
Grace
is
so
gracious,”
the
Queen
of
Thorns
had
replied,
and
everyone
had
exchanged
smiles.

Cersei’s
fingers
were
digging
into
Jaime’s
arm
hard
enough
to
leave
bruises.
“I
need
eyes
inside
that
room,”
she
said.

“To
see
what?”
he
said.
“There
can
be
no
danger
of
a
consummation.
Tommen
is
much
too
young.”

“And
Ossifer
Plumm
was
much
too
dead,
but
that
did
not
stop
him
fathering
a
child,
did
it?”

Her
brother
looked
lost.
“Who
was
Ossifer
Plumm?
Was
he
Lord
Philip’s
father,
or...
who?”

He
is
near
as
ignorant
as
Robert.
All
his
wits
were
in
his
sword
hand.
“Forget
Plumm,
just
remember
what
I
told
you.
Swear
to
me
that
you
will
stay
by
Tommen’s
side
until
the
sun
comes
up.”

“As
you
command,”
he
said,
as
if
her
fears
were
groundless.
“Do
you
still
mean
to
go
ahead
and
burn
the
Tower
of
the
Hand?”

“After
the
feast.”
It
was
the
only
part
of
the
day’s
festivities
that
Cersei
thought
she
might
enjoy.
“Our
lord
father
was
murdered
in
that
tower.
I
cannot
bear
to
look
at
it.
If
the
gods
are
good,
the
fire
may
smoke
a
few
rats
from
the
rubble.”

Jaime
rolled
his
eyes.
“Tyrion,
you
mean.”

“Him,
and
Lord
Varys,
and
this
gaoler.”

“If
any
of
them
were
hiding
in
the
tower,
we
would
have
found
them.
I’ve
had
a
small
army
going
at
it
with
picks
and
hammers.
We’ve
knocked
through
walls
and
ripped
up
floors
and
uncovered
half
a
hundred
secret
passages.”

“And
for
all
you
know
there
may
be
half
a
hundred
more.”
Some
of
the
secret
crawlways
had
turned
out
to
be
so
small
that
Jaime
had
needed
pages
and
stableboys
to
explore
them.
A
passage
to
the
black
cells
had
been
found,
and
a
stone
well
that
seemed
to
have
no
bottom.
They
had
found
a
chamber
full
of
skulls
and
yellowed
bones,
and
four
sacks
of
tarnished
silver
coins
from
the
reign
of
the
first
King
Viserys.
They
had
found
a
thousand
rats
as
well...
but
neither
Tyrion
nor
Varys
had
been
amongst
them,
and
Jaime
had
finally
insisted
on
putting
an
end
to
the
search.
One
boy
had
gotten
stuck
in
a
narrow
passage
and
had
to
be
pulled
out
by
his
feet,
shrieking.
Another
fell
down
a
shaft
and
broke
his
legs.
And
two
guardsmen
vanished
exploring
a
side
tunnel.
Some
of
the
other
guards
swore
they
could
hear
them
calling
faintly
through
the
stone,
but
when
Jaime’s
men
tore
down
the
wall
they
found
only
earth
and
rubble
on
the
far
side.
“The
Imp
is
small
and
cunning.
He
may
still
be
in
the
walls.
If
he
is,
the
fire
will
smoke
him
out.”

“Even
if
Tyrion
were
still
hiding
in
the
castle,
he
won’t
be
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
We’ve
reduced
it
to
a
shell.”

“Would
that
we
could
do
the
same
to
the
rest
of
this
foul
castle,”
said
Cersei.
“After
the
war
I
mean
to
build
a
new
palace
beyond
the
river.”
She
had
dreamed
of
it
the
night
before
last,
a
magnificent
white
castle
surrounded
by
woods
and
gardens,
long
leagues
from
the
stinks
and
noise
of
King’s
Landing.
“This
city
is
a
cesspit.
For
half
a
groat
I
would
move
the
court
to
Lannisport
and
rule
the
realm
from
Casterly
Rock.”

“That
would
be
an
even
greater
folly
than
burning
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
So
long
as
Tommen
sits
the
Iron
Throne,
the
realm
sees
him
as
the
true
king.
Hide
him
under
the
Rock
and
he
becomes
just
another
claimant
to
the
throne,
no
different
than
Stannis.”

“I
am
aware
of
that,”
the
queen
said
sharply.
“I
said
that
I
wanted
to
move
the
court
to
Lannisport,
not
that
I
would.
Were
you
always
this
slow,
or
did
losing
a
hand
make
you
stupid?”

Jaime
ignored
that.
“If
these
flames
spread
beyond
the
tower,
you
may
end
up
burning
down
the
castle
whether
you
mean
to
or
not.
Wildfire
is
treacherous.”

“Lord
Hallyne
has
assured
me
that
his
pyromancers
can
control
the
fire.”
The
Guild
of
Alchemists
had
been
brewing
fresh
wildfire
for
a
fortnight.
“Let
all
of
King’s
Landing
see
the
flames.
It
will
be
a
lesson
to
our
enemies.”

“Now
you
sound
like
Aerys.”

Her
nostrils
flared.
“Guard
your
tongue,
ser.”

“I
love
you
too,
sweet
sister.”

How
could
I
ever
have
loved
that
wretched
creature?
she
wondered
after
he
had
gone.
He
was
your
twin,
your
shadow,
your
other
half,
another
voice
whispered.
Once,
perhaps,
she
thought.
No
longer.
He
has
become
a
stranger
to
me.

Compared
to
the
magnificence
of
Joffrey’s
nuptials,
the
wedding
of
King
Tommen
was
a
modest
affair,
and
small.
No
one
wanted
another
lavish
ceremony,
least
of
all
the
queen,
and
no
one
wanted
to
pay
for
one,
least
of
all
the
Tyrells.
So
the
young
king
took
Margaery
Tyrell
to
wife
in
the
Red
Keep’s
royal
sept,
with
fewer
than
a
hundred
guests
looking
on
in
place
of
the
thousands
who
had
seen
his
brother
joined
to
the
same
woman.

The
bride
was
fair
and
gay
and
beautiful,
the
groom
still
baby-faced
and
plump.
He
recited
his
vows
in
a
high,
childish
voice,
promising
his
love
and
devotion
to
Mace
Tyrell’s
twice-widowed
daughter.
Margaery
wore
the
same
gown
she
had
worn
to
marry
Joffrey,
an
airy
confection
of
sheer
ivory
silk,
Myrish
lace,
and
seed
pearls.
Cersei
herself
was
still
in
black,
as
a
sign
of
mourning
for
her
murdered
firstborn.
His
widow
might
be
pleased
to
laugh
and
drink
and
dance
and
put
all
memory
of
Joff
aside,
but
his
mother
would
not
forget
him
so
easily.

This
is
wrong,
she
thought.
It
is
too
soon.
A
year,
two
years,
that
would
have
been
time
enough.
Highgarden
should
have
been
content
with
a
betrothal.
Cersei
stared
back
to
where
Mace
Tyrell
stood
between
his
wife
and
mother.
You
forced
me
into
this
travesty
of
a
wedding,
my
lord,
and
I
shall
not
soon
forget
it.

When
it
was
time
for
the
changing
of
the
cloaks,
the
bride
sank
gracefully
to
her
knees
and
Tommen
covered
her
with
the
heavy
cloth-of-gold
monstrosity
that
Robert
had
cloaked
Cersei
in
on
their
own
wedding
day,
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
worked
upon
its
back
in
beads
of
onyx.
Cersei
had
wanted
to
use
the
fine
red
silk
cloak
Joffrey
had
used.
“It
was
the
cloak
my
lord
father
used
when
he
wed
my
lady
mother,”
she
explained
to
the
Tyrells,
but
the
Queen
of
Thorns
had
balked
her
in
that
as
well.
“That
old
thing?”
the
crone
had
said.
“It
looks
a
bit
threadbare
to
me...
and
dare
I
say,
unlucky?
And
wouldn’t
a
stag
be
more
fitting
for
King
Robert’s
trueborn
son?
In
my
day
a
bride
donned
her
husband’s
colors,
not
his
lady
mother’s.”

Thanks
to
Stannis
and
his
filthy
letter,
there
were
already
too
many
rumors
concerning
Tommen’s
parentage.
Cersei
dared
not
fan
the
fires
by
insisting
that
he
drape
his
bride
in
Lannister
crimson,
so
she
yielded
as
gracefully
as
she
could.
But
the
sight
of
all
that
gold
and
onyx
still
filled
her
with
resentment.
The
more
we
give
these
Tyrells,
the
more
they
demand
of
us.

When
all
the
vows
were
spoken,
the
king
and
his
new
queen
stepped
outside
the
sept
to
accept
congratulations.
“Westeros
has
two
queens
now,
and
the
young
one
is
as
beautiful
as
the
old
one,”
boomed
Lyle
Crakehall,
an
oaf
of
a
knight
who
oft
reminded
Cersei
of
her
late
and
unlamented
husband.
She
could
have
slapped
him.
Gyles
Rosby
made
to
kiss
her
hand,
and
only
succeeded
in
coughing
on
her
fingers.
Lord
Redwyne
kissed
her
on
one
cheek
and
Mace
Tyrell
on
both.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
told
Cersei
that
she
had
not
lost
a
son,
but
rather
gained
a
daughter.
At
least
she
was
spared
Lady
Tanda’s
tearful
embraces.
None
of
the
Stokeworth
women
had
appeared,
and
for
that
much
the
queen
was
grateful.

Amongst
the
last
was
Kevan
Lannister.
“I
understand
you
mean
to
leave
us
for
another
wedding,”
the
queen
said
to
him.

“Hardstone
has
cleared
the
broken
men
from
Darry
castle,”
he
replied.
“Lancel’s
bride
awaits
us
there.”

“Will
your
lady
wife
be
joining
you
for
the
nuptials?”

“The
riverlands
are
still
too
dangerous.
Vargo
Hoat’s
scum
remain
abroad,
and
Beric
Dondarrion
has
been
hanging
Freys.
Is
it
true
that
Sandor
Clegane
has
joined
him?”

How
does
he
know
that?
“Some
say.
Reports
are
confused.”
The
bird
had
come
last
night,
from
a
septry
on
an
island
hard
by
the
mouth
of
the
Trident.
The
nearby
town
of
Saltpans
had
been
savagely
raided
by
a
band
of
outlaws,
and
some
of
the
survivors
claimed
a
roaring
brute
in
a
hound’s
head
helm
was
amongst
the
raiders.
Supposedly
he’d
killed
a
dozen
men
and
raped
a
girl
of
twelve.
“No
doubt
Lancel
will
be
eager
to
hunt
down
Clegane
and
Lord
Beric
both,
to
restore
the
king’s
peace
to
the
riverlands.”

Ser
Kevan
stared
into
her
eyes
for
a
moment.
“My
son
is
not
the
man
to
deal
with
Sandor
Clegane.”

We
agree
on
that
much,
at
least.
“His
father
might
be.”

Her
uncle’s
mouth
grew
hard.
“If
my
service
is
not
required
at
the
Rock...”

Your
service
was
required
here.
Cersei
had
named
her
cousin
Damion
Lannister
her
castellan
for
the
Rock,
and
another
cousin,
Ser
Daven
Lannister,
the
Warden
of
the
West.
Insolence
has
its
price,
Uncle.
“Bring
us
Sandor’s
head,
and
I
know
His
Grace
will
be
most
grateful.
Joff
may
have
liked
the
man,
but
Tommen
was
always
afraid
of
him...
with
good
reason,
it
would
seem.”

“When
a
dog
goes
bad,
the
fault
lies
with
his
master,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
Then
he
turned
and
walked
away.

Jaime
escorted
her
to
the
Small
Hall,
where
the
feast
was
being
readied.
“I
blame
you
for
all
this,”
she
whispered
as
they
walked.
“Let
them
wed,
you
said.
Margaery
should
be
mourning
Joffrey,
not
marrying
his
brother.
She
should
be
as
sick
with
grief
as
I
am.
I
do
not
believe
she
is
a
maid.
Renly
had
a
cock,
didn’t
he?
He
was
Robert’s
brother,
he
surely
had
a
cock.
If
that
disgusting
old
crone
thinks
that
I
will
allow
my
son
to—”

“You
will
be
rid
of
Lady
Olenna
soon
enough,”
Jaime
broke
in
quietly.
“She’s
returning
to
Highgarden
on
the
morrow.”

“So
she
says.”
Cersei
did
not
trust
any
Tyrell
promise.

“She’s
leaving,”
he
insisted.
“Mace
is
taking
half
the
Tyrell
strength
to
Storm’s
End,
and
the
other
half
will
be
going
back
to
the
Reach
with
Ser
Garlan
to
make
good
his
claim
on
Brightwater.
A
few
more
days,
and
the
only
roses
left
in
King’s
Landing
will
be
Margaery
and
her
ladies
and
a
few
guardsmen.”

“And
Ser
Loras.
Or
have
you
forgotten
your
Sworn
Brother?”

“Ser
Loras
is
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Ser
Loras
is
so
Tyrell
he
pisses
rosewater.
He
should
never
have
been
given
a
white
cloak.”

“He
would
not
have
been
my
choice,
I’ll
grant
you.
No
one
troubled
to
consult
me.
Loras
will
do
well
enough,
I
think.
Once
a
man
puts
on
that
cloak,
it
changes
him.”

“It
certainly
changed
you,
and
not
for
the
better.”

“I
love
you
too,
sweet
sister.”
He
held
the
door
for
her,
and
walked
her
to
the
high
table
and
her
seat
beside
the
king.
Margaery
was
on
the
other
side
of
Tommen,
in
the
place
of
honor.
When
she
entered,
arm
in
arm
with
the
little
king,
she
made
a
point
of
stopping
to
kiss
Cersei
on
the
cheeks
and
throw
her
arms
around
her.
“Your
Grace,”
the
girl
said,
bold
as
polished
brass,
“I
feel
as
though
I
have
a
second
mother
now.
I
pray
that
we
shall
be
very
close,
united
by
our
love
for
your
sweet
son.”

“I
loved
both
my
sons.”

“Joffrey
is
in
my
prayers
as
well,”
said
Margaery.
“I
loved
him
dearly,
though
I
never
had
the
chance
to
know
him.”

Liar,
the
queen
thought.
If
you
had
loved
him
even
for
an
instant,
you
would
not
have
been
in
such
unseemly
haste
to
wed
his
brother.
His
crown
was
all
you
ever
wanted.
For
half
a
groat
she
would
have
slapped
the
blushing
bride
right
there
upon
the
dais,
in
view
of
half
the
court.

Like
the
service,
the
wedding
feast
was
modest.
Lady
Alerie
had
made
all
the
arrangements;
Cersei
had
not
had
the
stomach
to
face
that
daunting
task
again,
after
the
way
Joffrey’s
wedding
had
ended.
Only
seven
courses
were
served.
Butterbumps
and
Moon
Boy
entertained
the
guests
between
dishes,
and
musicians
played
as
they
ate.
They
listened
to
pipers
and
fiddlers,
a
lute
and
a
flute,
a
high
harp.
The
only
singer
was
some
favorite
of
Lady
Margaery’s,
a
dashing
young
cock-a-whoop
clad
all
in
shades
of
azure
who
called
himself
the
Blue
Bard.
He
sang
a
few
love
songs
and
retired.
“What
a
disappointment,”
Lady
Olenna
complained
loudly.
“I
was
hoping
for
‘The
Rains
of
Castamere.’”

Whenever
Cersei
looked
at
the
old
crone,
the
face
of
Maggy
the
Frog
seemed
to
float
before
her
eyes,
wrinkled
and
terrible
and
wise.
All
old
women
look
alike,
she
tried
to
tell
herself,
that’s
all
it
is.
In
truth,
the
bent-back
sorceress
had
looked
nothing
like
the
Queen
of
Thorns,
yet
somehow
the
sight
of
Lady
Olenna’s
nasty
little
smile
was
enough
to
put
her
back
in
Maggy’s
tent
again.
She
could
still
remember
the
smell
of
it,
redolent
with
queer
eastern
spices,
and
the
softness
of
Maggy’s
gums
as
she
sucked
the
blood
from
Cersei’s
finger.
Queen
you
shall
be,
the
old
woman
had
promised,
with
her
lips
still
wet
and
red
and
glistening,
until
there
comes
another,
younger
and
more
beautiful,
to
cast
you
down
and
take
all
that
you
hold
dear.

Cersei
glanced
past
Tommen,
to
where
Margaery
sat
laughing
with
her
father.
She
is
pretty
enough,
she
had
to
admit,
but
most
of
that
is
youth.
Even
peasant
girls
are
pretty
at
a
certain
age,
when
they
are
still
fresh
and
innocent
and
unspoiled,
and
most
of
them
have
the
same
brown
hair
and
brown
eyes
as
she
does.
Only
a
fool
would
ever
claim
she
was
more
beautiful
than
I.
The
world
was
full
of
fools,
however.
So
was
her
son’s
court.

Her
mood
was
not
improved
when
Mace
Tyrell
arose
to
lead
the
toasts.
He
raised
a
golden
goblet
high,
smiling
at
his
pretty
little
daughter,
and
in
a
booming
voice
said,
“To
the
king
and
queen!”
The
other
sheep
all
baaaaaaed
along
with
him.
“The
king
and
queen!”
they
cried,
smashing
their
cups
together.
“The
king
and
queen!”
She
had
no
choice
but
to
drink
along
with
them,
all
the
time
wishing
that
the
guests
had
but
a
single
face,
so
she
could
throw
her
wine
into
their
eyes
and
remind
them
that
she
was
the
true
queen.
The
only
one
of
Tyrell’s
lickspittles
who
seemed
to
remember
her
at
all
was
Paxter
Redwyne,
who
rose
to
make
his
own
toast,
swaying
slightly.
“To
both
our
queens!”
he
chirruped.
“To
the
young
queen
and
the
old!”

Cersei
drank
several
cups
of
wine
and
pushed
her
food
around
a
golden
plate.
Jaime
ate
even
less,
and
seldom
deigned
to
occupy
his
seat
upon
the
dais.
He
is
as
anxious
as
I
am,
the
queen
realized
as
she
watched
him
prowl
the
hall,
twitching
aside
the
tapestries
with
his
good
hand
to
assure
himself
that
no
one
was
hiding
behind
them.
There
were
Lannister
spearmen
posted
around
the
building,
she
knew.
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
guarded
one
door,
Ser
Meryn
Trant
the
other.
Balon
Swann
stood
behind
the
king’s
chair,
Loras
Tyrell
behind
the
queen’s.
No
swords
had
been
allowed
inside
the
feast
save
for
those
the
white
knights
bore.

My
son
is
safe,
Cersei
told
herself.
No
harm
can
come
to
him,
not
here,
not
now.
Yet
every
time
she
looked
at
Tommen,
she
saw
Joffrey
clawing
at
his
throat.
And
when
the
boy
began
to
cough
the
queen’s
heart
stopped
beating
for
a
moment.
She
knocked
aside
a
serving
girl
in
her
haste
to
reach
him.

“Only
a
little
wine
that
went
down
the
wrong
way,”
Margaery
Tyrell
assured
her,
smiling.
She
took
Tommen’s
hand
in
her
own
and
kissed
his
fingers.
“My
little
love
needs
to
take
smaller
sips.
See,
you
scared
your
lady
mother
half
to
death.”

“I’m
sorry,
Mother,”
Tommen
said,
abashed.

It
was
more
than
Cersei
could
stand.
I
cannot
let
them
see
me
cry,
she
thought,
when
she
felt
the
tears
welling
in
her
eyes.
She
walked
past
Ser
Meryn
Trant
and
out
into
the
back
passage.
Alone
beneath
a
tallow
candle,
she
allowed
herself
a
shuddering
sob,
then
another.
A
woman
may
weep,
but
not
a
queen.

“Your
Grace?”
said
a
voice
behind
her.
“Do
I
intrude?”

It
was
a
woman’s
voice,
flavored
with
the
accents
of
the
east.
For
an
instant
she
feared
that
Maggy
the
Frog
was
speaking
to
her
from
the
grave.
But
it
was
only
Merryweather’s
wife,
the
sloe-eyed
beauty
Lord
Orton
had
wed
during
his
exile
and
fetched
home
with
him
to
Longtable.
“The
Small
Hall
is
so
stuffy,”
Cersei
heard
herself
say.
“The
smoke
was
making
my
eyes
water.”

“And
mine,
Your
Grace.”
Lady
Merryweather
was
as
tall
as
the
queen,
but
dark
instead
of
fair,
raven-haired
and
olive-skinned
and
younger
by
a
decade.
She
offered
the
queen
a
pale
blue
handkerchief
of
silk
and
lace.
“I
have
a
son
as
well.
I
know
that
I
shall
weep
rivers
on
the
day
he
weds.”

Cersei
wiped
her
cheeks,
furious
that
she
had
let
her
tears
be
seen.
“My
thanks,”
she
said
stiffly.

“Your
Grace,
I...”
The
Myrish
woman
lowered
her
voice.
“There
is
something
you
must
know.
Your
maid
is
bought
and
paid
for.
She
tells
Lady
Margaery
everything
you
do.”

“Senelle?”
Sudden
fury
twisted
in
the
queen’s
belly.
Was
there
no
one
she
could
trust?
“You
are
certain
of
this?”

“Have
her
followed.
Margaery
never
meets
with
her
directly.
Her
cousins
are
her
ravens,
they
bring
her
messages.
Sometimes
Elinor,
sometimes
Alla,
sometimes
Megga.
All
of
them
are
as
close
to
Margaery
as
sisters.
They
meet
in
the
sept
and
pretend
to
pray.
Put
your
own
man
in
the
gallery
on
the
morrow,
and
he
will
see
Senelle
whispering
to
Megga
beneath
the
altar
of
the
Maiden.”

“If
this
is
true,
why
tell
me?
You
are
one
of
Margaery’s
companions.
Why
would
you
betray
her?”
Cersei
had
learned
suspicion
at
her
father’s
knee;
this
could
well
be
some
trap,
a
lie
meant
to
sow
discord
between
the
lion
and
the
rose.

“Longtable
may
be
sworn
to
Highgarden,”
the
woman
replied,
with
a
toss
of
her
black
hair,
“but
I
am
of
Myr,
and
my
loyalty
is
to
my
husband
and
my
son.
I
want
all
that
is
best
for
them.”

“I
see.”
In
the
closeness
of
the
passage,
the
queen
could
smell
the
other
woman’s
perfume,
a
musky
scent
that
spoke
of
moss
and
earth
and
wildflowers.
Under
it,
she
smelled
ambition.
She
gave
testimony
at
Tyrion’s
trial,
Cersei
recalled
suddenly.
She
saw
the
Imp
put
the
poison
in
Joff’s
cup
and
was
not
afraid
to
say
so.
“I
shall
look
into
this,”
she
promised.
“If
what
you
say
is
true,
you
will
be
rewarded.”
And
if
you’ve
lied
to
me,
I’ll
have
your
tongue,
and
your
lord
husband’s
lands
and
gold
as
well.

“Your
Grace
is
kind.
And
beautiful.”
Lady
Merryweather
smiled.
Her
teeth
were
white,
her
lips
full
and
dark.

When
the
queen
returned
to
the
Small
Hall,
she
found
her
brother
pacing
restlessly.
“It
was
only
a
gulp
of
wine
that
went
down
the
wrong
way.
Though
it
startled
me
as
well.”

“My
belly
is
such
a
knot
that
I
cannot
eat,”
she
growled
at
him.
“The
wine
tastes
of
bile.
This
wedding
was
a
mistake.”

“This
wedding
was
necessary.
The
boy
is
safe.”

“Fool.
No
one
who
wears
a
crown
is
ever
safe.”
She
looked
about
the
hall.
Mace
Tyrell
laughed
amongst
his
knights.
Lords
Redwyne
and
Rowan
were
talking
furtively.
Ser
Kevan
sat
brooding
over
his
wine
at
the
back
of
the
hall,
whilst
Lancel
whispered
something
to
a
septon.
Senelle
was
moving
down
the
table,
filling
the
cups
of
the
bride’s
cousins
with
wine
as
red
as
blood.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
fallen
asleep.
There
is
no
one
I
can
rely
upon,
not
even
Jaime,
she
realized
grimly.
I
will
need
to
sweep
them
all
away
and
surround
the
king
with
mine
own
people.

Later,
after
sweets
and
nuts
and
cheese
had
been
served
and
cleared
away,
Margaery
and
Tommen
began
the
dancing,
looking
more
than
a
bit
ridiculous
as
they
whirled
about
the
floor.
The
Tyrell
girl
stood
a
good
foot
and
a
half
taller
than
her
little
husband,
and
Tommen
was
a
clumsy
dancer
at
best,
with
none
of
Joffrey’s
easy
grace.
He
did
his
earnest
best,
though,
and
seemed
oblivious
to
the
spectacle
he
was
making
of
himself.
And
no
sooner
was
Maid
Margaery
done
with
him
than
her
cousins
swooped
in,
one
after
the
other,
insisting
that
His
Grace
must
dance
with
them
as
well.
They
will
have
him
stumbling
and
shuffling
like
a
fool
by
the
time
they’re
done,
Cersei
thought
resentfully
as
she
watched.
Half
the
court
will
be
laughing
at
him
behind
his
back.

Whilst
Alla,
Elinor,
and
Megga
took
their
turns
with
Tommen,
Margaery
took
a
turn
around
the
floor
with
her
father,
then
another
with
her
brother
Loras.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
was
in
white
silk,
with
a
belt
of
golden
roses
about
his
waist
and
a
jade
rose
fastening
his
cloak.
They
could
be
twins,
Cersei
thought
as
she
watched
them.
Ser
Loras
was
a
year
older
than
his
sister,
but
they
had
the
same
big
brown
eyes,
the
same
thick
brown
hair
falling
in
lazy
ringlets
to
their
shoulders,
the
same
smooth
unblemished
skin.
A
ripe
crop
of
pimples
would
teach
them
some
humility.
Loras
was
taller
and
had
a
few
wisps
of
soft
brown
fuzz
on
his
face,
and
Margaery
had
a
woman’s
shape,
but
elsewise
they
were
more
alike
than
she
and
Jaime.
That
annoyed
her
too.

Her
own
twin
interrupted
her
musings.
“Would
Your
Grace
honor
her
white
knight
with
a
dance?”

She
gave
him
a
withering
look.
“And
have
you
fumbling
at
me
with
that
stump?
No.
I
will
let
you
fill
my
wine
cup
for
me,
though.
If
you
think
you
can
manage
it
without
spilling.”

“A
cripple
like
me?
Not
likely.”
He
moved
away
and
made
another
circuit
of
the
hall.
She
had
to
fill
her
own
cup.

Cersei
refused
Mace
Tyrell
as
well,
and
later
Lancel.
The
others
took
the
hint,
and
no
one
else
approached
her.
Our
fast
friends
and
loyal
lords.
She
could
not
even
trust
the
westermen,
her
father’s
sworn
swords
and
bannermen.
Not
if
her
own
uncle
was
conspiring
with
her
enemies...

Margaery
was
dancing
with
her
cousin
Alla,
Megga
with
Ser
Tallad
the
Tall.
The
other
cousin,
Elinor,
was
sharing
a
cup
of
wine
with
the
handsome
young
Bastard
of
Driftmark,
Aurane
Waters.
It
was
not
the
first
time
the
queen
had
made
note
of
Waters,
a
lean
young
man
with
grey-green
eyes
and
long
silver-gold
hair.
The
first
time
she
had
seen
him,
for
half
a
heartbeat
she
had
almost
thought
Rhaegar
Targaryen
had
returned
from
the
ashes.
It
is
his
hair,
she
told
herself.
He
is
not
half
as
comely
as
Rhaegar
was.
His
face
is
too
narrow,
and
he
has
that
cleft
in
his
chin.
The
Velaryons
came
from
old
Valyrian
stock,
however,
and
some
had
the
same
silvery
hair
as
the
dragonkings
of
old.

Tommen
returned
to
his
seat
to
nibble
at
an
applecake.
Her
uncle’s
place
was
empty.
The
queen
finally
found
him
in
a
corner,
talking
intently
with
Mace
Tyrell’s
son
Garlan.
What
do
they
have
to
talk
about?
The
Reach
might
call
Ser
Garlan
gallant,
but
she
trusted
him
no
more
than
Margaery
or
Loras.
She
had
not
forgotten
the
gold
coin
that
Qyburn
had
discovered
beneath
the
gaoler’s
chamber
pot.
A
golden
hand
from
Highgarden.
And
Margaery
is
spying
on
me.
When
Senelle
appeared
to
fill
her
wine
cup,
the
queen
had
to
resist
an
urge
to
take
her
by
the
throat
and
throttle
her.
Do
not
presume
to
smile
at
me,
you
treacherous
little
bitch.
You
will
be
begging
me
for
mercy
before
I’m
done
with
you.

“I
think
Her
Grace
has
had
enough
wine
for
one
night,”
she
heard
her
brother
Jaime
say.

No,
the
queen
thought.
All
the
wine
in
the
world
would
not
be
enough
to
see
me
through
this
wedding.
She
rose
so
fast
she
almost
fell.
Jaime
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
steadied
her.
She
wrenched
free
and
clapped
her
hands
together.
The
music
died,
the
voices
stilled.
“Lords
and
ladies,”
Cersei
called
out
loudly,
“if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
outside
with
me,
we
shall
light
a
candle
to
celebrate
the
union
of
Highgarden
and
Casterly
Rock,
and
a
new
age
of
peace
and
plenty
for
our
Seven
Kingdoms.”

Dark
and
forlorn
stood
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
with
only
gaping
holes
where
oaken
doors
and
shuttered
windows
had
once
been.
Yet
even
ruined
and
slighted,
it
loomed
above
the
outer
ward.
As
the
wedding
guests
filed
out
of
the
Small
Hall,
they
passed
beneath
its
shadow.
When
Cersei
looked
up
she
saw
the
tower’s
crenellated
battlements
gnawing
at
a
hunter’s
moon,
and
wondered
for
a
moment
how
many
Hands
of
how
many
kings
had
made
their
home
there
over
the
past
three
centuries.

A
hundred
yards
from
the
tower,
she
took
a
breath
to
stop
her
head
from
spinning.
“Lord
Hallyne!
You
may
commence.”

Hallyne
the
pyromancer
said
“Hmmmmmm”
and
waved
the
torch
he
was
holding,
and
the
archers
on
the
walls
bent
their
bows
and
sent
a
dozen
flaming
arrows
through
the
gaping
windows.

The
tower
went
up
with
a
whoosh.
In
half
a
heartbeat
its
interior
was
alive
with
light,
red,
yellow,
orange...
and
green,
an
ominous
dark
green,
the
color
of
bile
and
jade
and
pyromancer’s
piss.
“The
substance,”
the
alchemists
named
it,
but
common
folk
called
it
wildfire.
Fifty
pots
had
been
placed
inside
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
along
with
logs
and
casks
of
pitch
and
the
greater
part
of
the
worldly
possessions
of
a
dwarf
named
Tyrion
Lannister.

The
queen
could
feel
the
heat
of
those
green
flames.
The
pyromancers
said
that
only
three
things
burned
hotter
than
their
substance:
dragonflame,
the
fires
beneath
the
earth,
and
the
summer
sun.
Some
of
the
ladies
gasped
when
the
first
flames
appeared
in
the
windows,
licking
up
the
outer
walls
like
long
green
tongues.
Others
cheered,
and
made
toasts.

It
is
beautiful,
she
thought,
as
beautiful
as
Joffrey,
when
they
laid
him
in
my
arms.
No
man
had
ever
made
her
feel
as
good
as
she
had
felt
when
he
took
her
nipple
in
his
mouth
to
nurse.

Tommen
stared
wide-eyed
at
the
fires,
as
fascinated
as
he
was
frightened,
until
Margaery
whispered
something
in
his
ear
that
made
him
laugh.
Some
of
the
knights
began
to
make
wagers
on
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
tower
collapsed.
Lord
Hallyne
stood
humming
to
himself
and
rocking
on
his
heels.

Cersei
thought
of
all
the
King’s
Hands
that
she
had
known
through
the
years:
Owen
Merryweather,
Jon
Connington,
Qarlton
Chelsted,
Jon
Arryn,
Eddard
Stark,
her
brother
Tyrion.
And
her
father,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
her
father
most
of
all.
All
of
them
are
burning
now,
she
told
herself,
savoring
the
thought.
They
are
dead
and
burning,
every
one,
with
all
their
plots
and
schemes
and
betrayals.
It
is
my
day
now.
It
is
my
castle
and
my
kingdom.

The
Tower
of
the
Hand
gave
out
a
sudden
groan,
so
loud
that
all
the
conversation
stopped
abruptly.
Stone
cracked
and
split,
and
part
of
the
upper
battlements
fell
away
and
landed
with
a
crash
that
shook
the
hill,
sending
up
a
cloud
of
dust
and
smoke.
As
fresh
air
rushed
in
through
the
broken
masonry,
the
fire
surged
upward.
Green
flames
leapt
into
the
sky
and
whirled
around
each
other.
Tommen
shied
away,
till
Margaery
took
his
hand
and
said,
“Look,
the
flames
are
dancing.
Just
as
we
did,
my
love.”

“They
are.”
His
voice
was
filled
with
wonder.
“Mother,
look,
they’re
dancing.”

“I
see
them.
Lord
Hallyne,
how
long
will
the
fires
burn?”

“All
night,
Your
Grace.”

“It
makes
a
pretty
candle,
I
grant
you,”
said
Lady
Olenna
Tyrell,
leaning
on
her
cane
between
Left
and
Right.
“Bright
enough
to
see
us
safe
to
sleep,
I
think.
Old
bones
grow
weary,
and
these
young
ones
have
had
enough
excitement
for
one
night.
It
is
time
the
king
and
queen
were
put
to
bed.”

“Yes.”
Cersei
beckoned
to
Jaime.
“Lord
Commander,
escort
His
Grace
and
his
little
queen
to
their
pillows,
if
you
would.”

“As
you
command.
And
you
as
well?”

“No
need.”
Cersei
felt
too
alive
for
sleep.
The
wildfire
was
cleansing
her,
burning
away
all
her
rage
and
fear,
filling
her
with
resolve.
“The
flames
are
so
pretty.
I
want
to
watch
them
for
a
while.”

Jaime
hesitated.
“You
should
not
stay
alone.”

“I
will
not
be
alone.
Ser
Osmund
can
remain
with
me
and
keep
me
safe.
Your
Sworn
Brother.”

“If
it
please
Your
Grace,”
said
Kettleblack.

“It
does.”
Cersei
slid
her
arm
through
his,
and
side
by
side
they
watched
the
fire
rage.





THE
SOILED
KNIGHT

The
night
was
unseasonably
cool,
even
for
autumn.
A
brisk
wet
wind
was
swirling
down
the
alleys,
stirring
up
the
day’s
dust.
A
north
wind,
and
full
of
chill.
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
pulled
up
his
hood
to
cover
his
face.
It
would
not
do
for
him
to
be
recognized.
A
fortnight
past,
a
trader
had
been
butchered
in
the
shadow
city,
a
harmless
man
who’d
come
to
Dorne
for
fruit
and
found
death
instead
of
dates.
His
only
crime
was
being
from
King’s
Landing.

The
mob
would
find
a
sterner
foe
in
me.
He
would
almost
have
welcomed
an
attack.
His
hand
drifted
down
to
brush
lightly
over
the
hilt
on
the
longsword
that
hung
half-hidden
amongst
the
folds
of
his
layered
linen
robes,
the
outer
with
its
turquoise
stripes
and
rows
of
golden
suns,
and
the
lighter
orange
one
beneath.
The
Dornish
garb
was
comfortable,
but
his
father
would
have
been
aghast
had
he
lived
to
see
his
son
so
dressed.
He
was
a
man
of
the
Reach,
and
the
Dornish
were
his
ancient
foes,
as
the
tapestries
at
Old
Oak
bore
witness.
Arys
only
had
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
them
still.
Lord
Edgerran
the
Open-Handed,
seated
in
splendor
with
the
heads
of
a
hundred
Dornishmen
piled
round
his
feet.
The
Three
Leaves
in
the
Prince’s
Pass,
pierced
by
Dornish
spears,
Alester
sounding
his
warhorn
with
his
last
breath.
Ser
Olyvar
the
Green
Oak
all
in
white,
dying
at
the
side
of
the
Young
Dragon.
Dorne
is
no
fit
place
for
any
Oakheart.

Even
before
Prince
Oberyn
had
died,
the
knight
had
been
ill
at
ease
whenever
he
left
the
grounds
of
Sunspear
to
walk
the
alleys
of
the
shadow
city.
He
could
feel
eyes
upon
him
everywhere
he
went,
small
black
Dornish
eyes
regarding
him
with
thinly
veiled
hostility.
The
shopkeepers
did
their
best
to
cheat
him
at
every
turn,
and
sometimes
he
wondered
whether
the
taverners
were
spitting
in
his
drinks.
Once
a
group
of
ragged
boys
began
pelting
him
with
stones,
until
he
drew
his
sword
and
ran
them
off.
The
Red
Viper’s
death
had
inflamed
the
Dornish
even
more,
though
the
streets
had
quieted
a
bit
since
Prince
Doran
had
confined
the
Sand
Snakes
to
a
tower.
Even
so,
to
wear
his
white
cloak
openly
in
the
shadow
city
would
be
asking
for
attack.
He
had
brought
three
with
him:
two
of
wool,
one
light
and
one
heavy,
the
third
of
fine
white
silk.
He
felt
naked
without
one
hanging
from
his
shoulders.

Better
naked
than
dead,
he
told
himself.
I
am
a
Kingsguard
still,
even
uncloaked.
She
must
respect
that.
I
must
make
her
understand.
He
should
never
have
let
himself
be
drawn
into
this,
but
the
singer
said
that
love
can
make
a
fool
of
any
man.

Sunspear’s
shadow
city
oft
seemed
deserted
in
the
heat
of
the
day,
when
only
buzzing
flies
moved
down
the
dusty
streets,
but
once
evening
fell
the
same
streets
came
to
life.
Ser
Arys
heard
faint
music
drifting
through
louvered
windows
as
he
passed
below,
and
somewhere
finger
drums
were
beating
out
the
quick
rhythm
of
a
spear
dance,
giving
the
night
a
pulse.
Where
three
alleys
met
beneath
the
second
of
the
Winding
Walls,
a
pillow
girl
called
down
from
a
balcony.
She
was
dressed
in
jewels
and
oil.
He
took
a
look
at
her,
hunched
his
shoulders,
and
pushed
on,
into
the
teeth
of
the
wind.
We
men
are
so
weak.
Our
bodies
betray
even
the
noblest
of
us.
He
thought
of
King
Baelor
the
Blessed,
who
would
fast
to
the
point
of
fainting
to
tame
the
lusts
that
shamed
him.
Must
he
do
the
same?

A
short
man
stood
in
an
arched
doorway
grilling
chunks
of
snake
over
a
brazier,
turning
them
with
wooden
tongs
as
they
crisped.
The
pungent
smell
of
his
sauces
brought
tears
to
the
knight’s
eyes.
The
best
snake
sauce
had
a
drop
of
venom
in
it,
he
had
heard,
along
with
mustard
seeds
and
dragon
peppers.
Myrcella
had
taken
to
Dornish
food
as
quick
as
she
had
to
her
Dornish
prince,
and
from
time
to
time
Ser
Arys
would
try
a
dish
or
two
to
please
her.
The
food
seared
his
mouth
and
made
him
gasp
for
wine,
and
burned
even
worse
coming
out
than
it
did
going
in.
His
little
princess
loved
it,
though.

He
had
left
her
in
her
chambers,
bent
over
a
gaming
table
opposite
Prince
Trystane,
pushing
ornate
pieces
across
squares
of
jade
and
carnelian
and
lapis
lazuli.
Myrcella’s
full
lips
had
been
slightly
parted,
her
green
eyes
narrowed
with
concentration.
Cyvasse,
the
game
was
called.
It
had
come
to
the
Planky
Town
on
a
trading
galley
from
Volantis,
and
the
orphans
had
spread
it
up
and
down
the
Greenblood.
The
Dornish
court
was
mad
for
it.

Ser
Arys
just
found
it
maddening.
There
were
ten
different
pieces,
each
with
its
own
attributes
and
powers,
and
the
board
would
change
from
game
to
game,
depending
on
how
the
players
arrayed
their
home
squares.
Prince
Trystane
had
taken
to
the
game
at
once,
and
Myrcella
had
learned
it
so
she
could
play
with
him.
She
was
not
quite
one-and-ten,
her
betrothed
three-and-ten;
even
so,
she
had
been
winning
more
oft
than
not
of
late.
Trystane
did
not
seem
to
mind.
The
two
children
could
not
have
looked
more
different,
him
with
his
olive
skin
and
straight
black
hair,
her
pale
as
milk
with
a
mop
of
golden
curls;
light
and
dark,
like
Queen
Cersei
and
King
Robert.
He
prayed
Myrcella
would
find
more
joy
in
her
Dornish
boy
than
her
mother
had
found
with
her
storm
lord.

It
made
him
feel
uneasy
to
leave
her,
though
she
should
be
safe
enough
within
the
castle.
There
were
only
two
doors
that
gave
access
to
Myrcella’s
chambers
in
the
Tower
of
the
Sun,
and
Ser
Arys
kept
two
men
on
each;
Lannister
household
guards,
men
who
had
come
with
them
from
King’s
Landing,
battle-tested,
tough,
and
loyal
to
the
bone.
Myrcella
had
her
maids
and
Septa
Eglantine
as
well,
and
Prince
Trystane
was
attended
by
his
sworn
shield,
Ser
Gascoyne
of
the
Greenblood.
No
one
will
trouble
her,
he
told
himself,
and
in
a
fortnight
we
shall
be
safely
away.

Prince
Doran
had
promised
as
much.
Though
Arys
had
been
shocked
to
see
how
aged
and
infirm
the
Dornish
prince
appeared,
he
did
not
doubt
the
prince’s
word.
“I
am
sorry
I
could
not
see
you
until
now,
or
meet
Princess
Myrcella,”
Martell
had
said
when
Arys
was
admitted
to
his
solar,
“but
I
trust
that
my
daughter
Arianne
has
made
you
welcome
here
in
Dorne,
ser.”

“She
has,
my
prince,”
he’d
answered,
and
prayed
that
no
blush
would
dare
betray
him.

“Ours
is
a
harsh
land,
and
poor,
yet
not
without
its
beauties.
It
grieves
us
that
you
have
seen
no
more
of
Dorne
than
Sunspear,
but
I
fear
that
neither
you
nor
your
princess
would
be
safe
beyond
these
walls.
We
Dornish
are
a
hot-blooded
people,
quick
to
anger
and
slow
to
forgive.
It
would
gladden
my
heart
if
I
could
assure
you
that
the
Sand
Snakes
were
alone
in
wanting
war,
but
I
will
not
tell
you
lies,
ser.
You
have
heard
my
smallfolk
in
the
streets,
crying
out
for
me
to
call
my
spears.
Half
my
lords
agree
with
them,
I
fear.”

“And
you,
my
prince?”
the
knight
had
dared
to
ask.

“My
mother
taught
me
long
ago
that
only
madmen
fight
wars
they
cannot
win.”
If
the
bluntness
of
the
question
had
offended
him,
Prince
Doran
hid
it
well.
“Yet
this
peace
is
fragile...
as
fragile
as
your
princess.”

“Only
a
beast
would
harm
a
little
girl.”

“My
sister
Elia
had
a
little
girl
as
well.
Her
name
was
Rhaenys.
She
was
a
princess
too.”
The
prince
sighed.
“Those
who
would
plunge
a
knife
into
Princess
Myrcella
do
not
bear
her
any
malice,
no
more
than
Ser
Amory
Lorch
did
when
he
killed
Rhaenys,
if
indeed
he
did.
They
seek
only
to
force
my
hand.
For
if
Myrcella
should
be
slain
in
Dorne
whilst
under
my
protection,
who
would
believe
my
denials?”

“No
one
shall
ever
harm
Myrcella
whilst
I
live.”

“A
noble
vow,”
said
Doran
Martell
with
a
faint
smile,
“but
you
are
only
one
man,
ser.
I
had
hoped
that
imprisoning
my
headstrong
nieces
would
help
to
calm
the
waters,
but
all
we’ve
done
is
drive
the
roaches
back
beneath
the
rushes.
Every
night
I
hear
them
whispering
and
sharpening
their
knives.”

He
is
afraid,
Ser
Arys
realized
then.
Look,
his
hand
is
shaking.
The
Prince
of
Dorne
is
terrified.
Words
failed
him.

“My
apologies,
ser,”
Prince
Doran
said.
“I
am
frail
and
failing,
and
sometimes...
Sunspear
wearies
me,
with
its
noise
and
dirt
and
smells.
As
soon
as
my
duty
allows,
I
mean
to
return
to
the
Water
Gardens.
When
I
do
I
shall
take
Princess
Myrcella
with
me.”
Before
the
knight
could
protest,
the
prince
raised
a
hand,
its
knuckles
red
and
swollen.
“You
shall
go
as
well.
And
her
septa,
her
maids,
her
guards.
Sunspear’s
walls
are
strong,
but
beneath
them
is
the
shadow
city.
Even
within
the
castle
hundreds
come
and
go
each
day.
The
Gardens
are
my
haven.
Prince
Maron
raised
them
as
a
gift
for
his
Targaryen
bride,
to
mark
Dorne’s
marriage
to
the
Iron
Throne.
Autumn
is
a
lovely
season
there...
hot
days,
cool
nights,
the
salt
breeze
off
the
sea,
the
fountains
and
the
pools.
And
there
are
other
children,
boys
and
girls
of
high
and
gentle
birth.
Myrcella
will
have
friends
of
her
own
age
to
play
with.
She
will
not
be
lonely.”

“As
you
say.”
The
prince’s
words
pounded
in
his
head.
She
will
be
safe
there.
Only
why
had
Doran
Martell
urged
him
not
to
write
King’s
Landing
about
the
move?
Myrcella
will
be
safest
if
no
one
knows
just
where
she
is.
Ser
Arys
had
agreed,
but
what
choice
did
he
have?
He
was
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard,
but
only
one
man
for
all
that,
just
as
the
prince
had
said.

The
alley
opened
suddenly
onto
a
moonlit
courtyard.
Past
the
candlemaker’s
shop,
she
wrote,
a
gate
and
a
short
flight
of
exterior
steps.
He
pushed
through
the
gate
and
climbed
the
worn
steps
to
an
unmarked
door.
Should
I
knock?
He
pushed
the
door
open
instead,
and
found
himself
in
a
large,
dim
room
with
a
low
ceiling,
lit
by
a
pair
of
scented
candles
that
flickered
in
niches
cut
from
the
thick
earthen
walls.
He
saw
patterned
Myrish
carpets
underneath
his
sandals,
a
tapestry
upon
one
wall,
a
bed.
“My
lady?”
he
called.
“Where
are
you?”

“Here.”
She
stepped
out
from
the
shadow
behind
the
door.

An
ornate
snake
coiled
around
her
right
forearm,
its
copper
and
gold
scales
glimmering
when
she
moved.
It
was
all
she
wore.

No,
he
meant
to
tell
her,
I
only
came
to
tell
you
I
must
go,
but
when
he
saw
her
shining
in
the
candlelight
he
seemed
to
lose
the
power
of
speech.
His
throat
felt
as
dry
as
the
Dornish
sands.
Silent
he
stood,
drinking
in
the
glories
of
her
body,
the
hollow
of
her
throat,
the
round
ripe
breasts
with
their
huge
dark
nipples,
the
lush
curves
at
waist
and
hip.
And
then
somehow
he
was
holding
her,
and
she
was
pulling
off
his
robes.
When
she
reached
his
undertunic
she
seized
it
by
the
shoulders
and
ripped
the
silk
down
to
his
navel,
but
Arys
was
past
caring.
Her
skin
was
smooth
beneath
his
fingers,
as
warm
to
the
touch
as
sand
baked
by
the
Dornish
sun.
He
raised
her
head
and
found
her
lips.
Her
mouth
opened
under
his,
and
her
breasts
filled
his
hands.
He
felt
her
nipples
stiffen
as
his
thumbs
brushed
over
them.
Her
hair
was
black
and
thick
and
smelled
of
orchids,
a
dark
and
earthy
smell
that
made
him
so
hard
it
almost
hurt.

“Touch
me,
ser,”
the
woman
whispered
in
his
ear.
His
hand
slipped
down
her
rounded
belly
to
find
the
sweet
wet
place
beneath
the
thicket
of
black
hair.
“Yes,
there,”
she
murmured
as
he
slipped
a
finger
up
inside
her.
She
made
a
whimpering
sound,
drew
him
to
the
bed,
and
pushed
him
down.
“More,
oh
more,
yes,
sweet,
my
knight,
my
knight,
my
sweet
white
knight,
yes
you,
you,
I
want
you.”
Her
hands
guided
him
inside
her,
then
slipped
around
his
back
to
pull
him
closer.
“Deeper,”
she
whispered.
“Yes,
oh.”
When
she
wrapped
her
legs
around
him,
they
felt
as
strong
as
steel.
Her
nails
raked
his
back
as
he
drove
into
her,
again
and
again
and
again,
until
she
screamed
and
arched
her
back
beneath
him.
As
she
did,
her
fingers
found
his
nipples,
pinching
till
he
spent
his
seed
within
her.
I
could
die
now,
happy,
the
knight
thought,
and
for
a
dozen
heartbeats
at
least
he
was
at
peace.

He
did
not
die.

His
desire
was
as
deep
and
boundless
as
the
sea,
but
when
the
tide
receded,
the
rocks
of
shame
and
guilt
thrust
up
as
sharp
as
ever.
Sometimes
the
waves
would
cover
them,
but
they
remained
beneath
the
waters,
hard
and
black
and
slimy.
What
am
I
doing?
he
asked
himself.
I
am
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
He
rolled
off
of
her
to
sprawl
staring
at
the
ceiling.
A
great
crack
ran
across
it,
from
one
wall
to
the
other.
He
had
not
noticed
that
before,
no
more
than
he
had
noticed
the
picture
on
the
tapestry,
a
scene
of
Nymeria
and
her
ten
thousand
ships.
I
see
only
her.
A
dragon
might
have
been
peering
in
the
window,
and
I
would
never
have
seen
anything
but
her
breasts,
her
face,
her
smile.

“There
is
wine,”
she
murmured
against
his
neck.
She
slid
a
hand
across
his
chest.
“Are
you
thirsty?”

“No.”
He
rolled
away,
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed.
The
room
was
hot,
and
yet
he
shivered.

“You
bleed,”
she
said.
“I
scratched
too
hard.”

When
she
touched
his
back,
he
flinched
as
if
her
fingers
were
afire.
“Don’t.”
Naked,
he
stood.
“No
more.”

“I
have
balm.
For
the
scratches.”

But
none
for
my
shame.
“The
scratches
are
nothing.
Forgive
me,
my
lady,
I
must
go...”

“So
soon?”
She
had
a
husky
voice,
a
wide
mouth
made
for
whispers,
full
lips
ripe
for
kissing.
Her
hair
tumbled
down
across
her
bare
shoulders
to
the
tops
of
her
full
breasts,
black
and
thick.
It
curled
in
big
soft
lazy
ringlets.
Even
the
hair
upon
her
mound
was
soft
and
curly.
“Stay
with
me
tonight,
ser.
I
still
have
much
to
teach
you.”

“I
have
learned
too
much
from
you
already.”

“You
seemed
glad
enough
for
the
lessons
at
the
time,
ser.
Are
you
certain
you
are
not
off
to
some
other
bed,
some
other
woman?
Tell
me
who
she
is.
I
will
fight
her
for
you,
bare-breasted,
knife
to
knife.”
She
smiled.
“Unless
she
is
a
Sand
Snake.
If
so,
we
can
share
you.
I
love
my
cousins
well.”

“You
know
I
have
no
other
woman.
Only...
duty.”

She
rolled
onto
one
elbow
to
look
up
at
him,
her
big
black
eyes
shining
in
the
candlelight.
“That
poxy
bitch?
I
know
her.
Dry
as
dust
between
the
legs,
and
her
kisses
leave
you
bleeding.
Let
duty
sleep
alone
for
once,
and
stay
with
me
tonight.”

“My
place
is
at
the
palace.”

She
sighed.
“With
your
other
princess.
You
will
make
me
jealous.
I
think
you
love
her
more
than
me.
The
maid
is
much
too
young
for
you.
You
need
a
woman,
not
a
little
girl,
but
I
can
play
the
innocent
if
that
excites
you.”

“You
should
not
say
such
things.”
Remember,
she
is
Dornish.
In
the
Reach
men
said
it
was
the
food
that
made
Dornishmen
so
hot-tempered
and
their
women
so
wild
and
wanton.
Fiery
peppers
and
strange
spices
heat
the
blood,
she
cannot
help
herself.
“I
love
Myrcella
as
a
daughter.”
He
could
never
have
a
daughter
of
his
own,
no
more
than
he
could
have
a
wife.
He
had
a
fine
white
cloak
instead.
“We
are
going
to
the
Water
Gardens.”

“Eventually,”
she
agreed,
“though
with
my
father,
everything
takes
four
times
as
long
as
it
should.
If
he
says
he
means
to
leave
upon
the
morrow,
you
will
certainly
set
out
within
a
fortnight.
You
will
be
lonely
in
the
Gardens,
I
promise
you.
And
where
is
the
brave
young
gallant
who
said
he
wished
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
my
arms?”

“I
was
drunk
when
I
said
that.”

“You’d
had
three
cups
of
watered
wine.”

“I
was
drunk
on
you.
It
had
been
ten
years
since...
I
never
touched
a
woman
until
you,
not
since
I
took
the
white.
I
never
knew
what
love
could
be,
yet
now...
I
am
afraid.”

“What
would
frighten
my
white
knight?”

“I
fear
for
my
honor,”
he
said,
“and
for
yours.”

“I
can
tend
to
my
own
honor.”
She
touched
a
finger
to
her
breast,
drawing
it
slowly
round
her
nipple.
“And
to
my
own
pleasures,
if
need
be.
I
am
a
woman
grown.”

She
was
that,
beyond
a
doubt.
Seeing
her
there
upon
the
featherbed,
smiling
that
wicked
smile,
toying
with
her
breast...
was
there
ever
a
woman
with
nipples
so
large
or
so
responsive?
He
could
hardly
look
at
them
without
wanting
to
grab
them,
to
suckle
them
until
they
were
hard
and
wet
and
shiny...

He
looked
away.
His
smallclothes
were
strewn
on
the
carpets.
The
knight
bent
to
pick
them
up.

“Your
hands
are
shaking,”
she
pointed
out.
“They
would
sooner
be
caressing
me,
I
think.
Must
you
be
in
such
haste
to
don
your
clothes,
ser?
I
prefer
you
as
you
are.
Abed,
unclad,
we
are
our
truest
selves,
a
man
and
a
woman,
lovers,
one
flesh,
as
close
as
two
can
be.
Our
clothes
make
us
different
people.
I
would
sooner
be
flesh
and
blood
than
silks
and
jewels,
and
you...
you
are
not
your
white
cloak,
ser.”

“I
am,”
Ser
Arys
said.
“I
am
my
cloak.
And
this
must
end,
for
your
sake
as
well
as
mine.
If
we
should
be
discovered...”

“Men
will
think
you
fortunate.”

“Men
will
think
me
an
oathbreaker.
What
if
someone
were
to
go
to
your
father
and
tell
him
how
I’d
dishonored
you?”

“My
father
is
many
things,
but
no
one
has
ever
said
he
was
a
fool.
The
Bastard
of
Godsgrace
had
my
maidenhead
when
we
were
both
fourteen.
Do
you
know
what
my
father
did
when
he
learned
of
it?”
She
gathered
the
bedclothes
in
her
fist
and
pulled
them
up
under
her
chin,
to
hide
her
nakedness.
“Nothing.
My
father
is
very
good
at
doing
nothing.
He
calls
it
thinking.
Tell
me
true,
ser,
is
it
my
dishonor
that
concerns
you,
or
your
own?”

“Both.”
Her
accusation
stung.
“That
is
why
this
must
be
our
last
time.”

“So
you
have
said
before.”

I
did,
and
meant
it
too.
But
I
am
weak,
else
I
would
not
be
here
now.
He
could
not
tell
her
that;
she
was
the
sort
of
woman
who
despised
weakness,
he
could
sense
that.
She
has
more
of
her
uncle
in
her
than
her
father.
He
turned
away
and
found
his
striped
silk
undertunic
on
a
chair.
She
had
ripped
the
fabric
to
the
navel
when
she
pulled
it
down
over
his
arms.
“This
is
ruined,”
he
complained.
“How
can
I
wear
it
now?”

“Backwards,”
she
suggested.
“Once
you
don
your
robes,
no
one
will
see
the
tear.
Perhaps
your
little
princess
will
sew
it
up
for
you.
Or
shall
I
send
a
new
one
to
the
Water
Gardens?”

“Send
me
no
gifts.”
That
would
only
draw
attention.
He
shook
out
the
undertunic
and
pulled
it
over
his
head,
backwards.
The
silk
felt
cool
against
his
skin,
though
it
clung
to
his
back
where
she’d
scratched
him.
It
would
serve
to
get
=======
cannot
know
what
she
is
saying.”

“She
knows,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lysa
is
impulsive,
yes,
but
this
message
was
carefully
planned,
cleverly
hidden.
She
knew
it
meant
death
if
her
letter
fell
into
the
wrong
hands.
To
risk
so
much,
she
must
have
had
more
than
mere
suspicion.”
Catelyn
looked
to
her
husband.
“Now
we
truly
have
no
choice.
You
must
be
Robert’s
Hand.
You
must
go
south
with
him
and
learn
the
truth.”

She
saw
at
once
that
Ned
had
reached
a
very
different
conclusion.
“The
only
truths
I
know
are
here.
The
south
is
a
nest
of
adders
I
would
do
better
to
avoid.”

Luwin
plucked
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
had
chafed
the
soft
skin
of
his
throat.
“The
Hand
of
the
King
has
great
power,
my
lord.
Power
to
find
the
truth
of
Lord
Arryn’s
death,
to
bring
his
killers
to
the
king’s
justice.
Power
to
protect
Lady
Arryn
and
her
son,
if
the
worst
be
true.”

Ned
glanced
helplessly
around
the
bedchamber.
Catelyn’s
heart
went
out
to
him,
but
she
knew
she
could
not
take
him
in
her
arms
just
then.
First
the
victory
must
be
won,
for
her
children’s
sake.
“You
say
you
love
Robert
like
a
brother.
Would
you
leave
your
brother
surrounded
by
Lannisters?”

“The
Others
take
both
of
you,”
Ned
muttered
darkly.
He
turned
away
from
them
and
went
to
the
window.
She
did
not
speak,
nor
did
the
maester.
They
waited,
quiet,
while
Eddard
Stark
said
a
silent
farewell
to
the
home
he
loved.
When
he
turned
away
from
the
window
at
last,
his
voice
was
tired
and
full
of
melancholy,
and
moisture
glittered
faintly
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes.
“My
father
went
south
once,
to
answer
the
summons
of
a
king.
He
never
came
home
again.”

“A
different
time,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“A
different
king.”

“Yes,”
Ned
said
dully.
He
seated
himself
in
a
chair
by
the
hearth.
“Catelyn,
you
shall
stay
here
in
Winterfell.”

His
words
were
like
an
icy
draft
through
her
heart.
“No,”
she
said,
suddenly
afraid.
Was
this
to
be
her
punishment?
Never
to
see
his
face
again,
nor
to
feel
his
arms
around
her?

“Yes,”
Ned
said,
in
words
that
would
brook
no
argument.
“You
must
govern
the
north
in
my
stead,
while
I
run
Robert’s
errands.
There
must
always
be
a
Stark
in
Winterfell.
Robb
is
fourteen.
Soon
enough,
he
will
be
a
man
grown.
He
must
learn
to
rule,
and
I
will
not
be
here
for
him.
Make
him
part
of
your
councils.
He
must
be
ready
when
his
time
comes.”

“Gods
will,
not
for
many
years,”
Maester
Luwin
murmured.

“Maester
Luwin,
I
trust
you
as
I
would
my
own
blood.
Give
my
wife
your
voice
in
all
things
great
and
small.
Teach
my
son
the
things
he
needs
to
know.
Winter
is
coming.”

Maester
Luwin
nodded
gravely.
Then
silence
fell,
until
Catelyn
found
her
courage
and
asked
the
question
whose
answer
she
most
dreaded.
“What
of
the
other
children?”

Ned
stood,
and
took
her
in
his
arms,
and
held
her
face
close
to
his.
“Rickon
is
very
young,”
he
said
gently.
“He
should
stay
here
with
you
and
Robb.
The
others
I
would
take
with
me.”

“I
could
not
bear
it,”
Catelyn
said,
trembling.

“You
must,”
he
said.
“Sansa
must
wed
Joffrey,
that
is
clear
now,
we
must
give
them
no
grounds
to
suspect
our
devotion.
And
it
is
past
time
that
Arya
learned
the
ways
of
a
southron
court.
In
a
few
years
she
will
be
of
an
age
to
marry
too.”

Sansa
would
shine
in
the
south,
Catelyn
thought
to
herself,
and
the
gods
knew
that
Arya
needed
refinement.
Reluctantly,
she
let
go
of
them
in
her
heart.
But
not
Bran.
Never
Bran.
“Yes,”
she
said,
“but
please,
Ned,
for
the
love
you
bear
me,
let
Bran
remain
here
at
Winterfell.
He
is
only
seven.”

“I
was
eight
when
my
father
sent
me
to
foster
at
the
Eyrie,”
Ned
said.
“Ser
Rodrik
tells
me
there
is
bad
feeling
between
Robb
and
Prince
Joffrey.
That
is
not
healthy.
Bran
can
bridge
that
distance.
He
is
a
sweet
boy,
quick
to
laugh,
easy
to
love.
Let
him
grow
up
with
the
young
princes,
let
him
become
their
friend
as
Robert
became
mine.
Our
House
will
be
the
safer
for
it.”

He
was
right;
Catelyn
knew
it.
It
did
not
make
the
pain
any
easier
to
bear.
She
would
lose
all
four
of
them,
then:
Ned,
and
both
girls,
and
her
sweet,
loving
Bran.
Only
Robb
and
little
Rickon
would
be
left
to
her.
She
felt
lonely
already.
Winterfell
was
such
a
vast
place.
“Keep
him
off
the
walls,
then,”
she
said
bravely.
“You
know
how
Bran
loves
to
climb.”

Ned
kissed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
before
they
could
fall.
“Thank
you,
my
lady,”
he
whispered.
“This
is
hard,
I
know.”

“What
of
Jon
Snow,
my
lord?”
Maester
Luwin
asked.

Catelyn
tensed
at
the
mention
of
the
name.
Ned
felt
the
anger
in
her,
and
pulled
away.

Many
men
fathered
bastards.
Catelyn
had
grown
up
with
that
knowledge.
It
came
as
no
surprise
to
her,
in
the
first
year
of
her
marriage,
to
learn
that
Ned
had
fathered
a
child
on
some
girl
chance
met
on
campaign.
He
had
a
man’s
needs,
after
all,
and
they
had
spent
that
year
apart,
Ned
off
at
war
in
the
south
while
she
remained
safe
in
her
father’s
castle
at
Riverrun.
Her
thoughts
were
more
of
Robb,
the
infant
at
her
breast,
than
of
the
husband
she
scarcely
knew.
He
was
welcome
to
whatever
solace
he
might
find
between
battles.
And
if
his
seed
quickened,
she
expected
he
would
see
to
the
child’s
needs.

He
did
more
than
that.
The
Starks
were
not
like
other
men.
Ned
brought
his
bastard
home
with
him,
and
called
him
“son”
for
all
the
north
to
see.
When
the
wars
were
over
at
last,
and
Catelyn
rode
to
Winterfell,
Jon
and
his
wet
nurse
had
already
taken
up
residence.

That
cut
deep.
Ned
would
not
speak
of
the
mother,
not
so
much
as
a
word,
but
a
castle
has
no
secrets,
and
Catelyn
heard
her
maids
repeating
tales
they
heard
from
the
lips
of
her
husband’s
soldiers.
They
whispered
of
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
deadliest
of
the
seven
knights
of
Aerys’s
Kingsguard,
and
of
how
their
young
lord
had
slain
him
in
single
combat.
And
they
told
how
afterward
Ned
had
carried
Ser
Arthur’s
sword
back
to
the
beautiful
young
sister
who
awaited
him
in
a
castle
called
Starfall
on
the
shores
of
the
Summer
Sea.
The
Lady
Ashara
Dayne,
tall
and
fair,
with
haunting
violet
eyes.
It
had
taken
her
a
fortnight
to
marshal
her
courage,
but
finally,
in
bed
one
night,
Catelyn
had
asked
her
husband
the
truth
of
it,
asked
him
to
his
face.

That
was
the
only
time
in
all
their
years
that
Ned
had
ever
frightened
her.
“Never
ask
me
about
Jon,”
he
said,
cold
as
ice.
“He
is
my
blood,
and
that
is
all
you
need
to
know.
And
now
I
will
learn
where
you
heard
that
name,
my
lady.”
She
had
pledged
to
obey;
she
told
him;
and
from
that
day
on,
the
whispering
had
stopped,
and
Ashara
Dayne’s
name
was
never
heard
in
Winterfell
again.

Whoever
Jon’s
mother
had
been,
Ned
must
have
loved
her
fiercely,
for
nothing
Catelyn
said
would
persuade
him
to
send
the
boy
away.
It
was
the
one
thing
she
could
never
forgive
him.
She
had
come
to
love
her
husband
with
all
her
heart,
but
she
had
never
found
it
in
her
to
love
Jon.
She
might
have
overlooked
a
dozen
bastards
for
Ned’s
sake,
so
long
as
they
were
out
of
sight.
Jon
was
never
out
of
sight,
and
as
he
grew,
he
looked
more
like
Ned
than
any
of
the
trueborn
sons
she
bore
him.
Somehow
that
made
it
worse.
“Jon
must
go,”
she
said
now.

“He
and
Robb
are
close,”
Ned
said.
“I
had
hoped…”

“He
cannot
stay
here,”
Catelyn
said,
cutting
him
off.
“He
is
your
son,
not
mine.
I
will
not
have
him.”
It
was
hard,
she
knew,
but
no
less
the
truth.
Ned
would
do
the
boy
no
kindness
by
leaving
him
here
at
Winterfell.

The
look
Ned
gave
her
was
anguished.
“You
know
I
cannot
take
him
south.
There
will
be
no
place
for
him
at
court.
A
boy
with
a
bastard’s
name…
you
know
what
they
will
say
of
him.
He
will
be
shunned.”

Catelyn
armored
her
heart
against
the
mute
appeal
in
her
husband’s
eyes.
“They
say
your
friend
Robert
has
fathered
a
dozen
bastards
himself.”

“And
none
of
them
has
ever
been
seen
at
court!”
Ned
blazed.
“The
Lannister
woman
has
seen
to
that.
How
can
you
be
so
damnably
cruel,
Catelyn?
He
is
only
a
boy.
He—”

His
fury
was
on
him.
He
might
have
said
more,
and
worse,
but
Maester
Luwin
cut
in.
“Another
solution
presents
itself,”
he
said,
his
voice
quiet.
“Your
brother
Benjen
came
to
me
about
Jon
a
few
days
ago.
It
seems
the
boy
aspires
to
take
the
black.”

Ned
looked
shocked.
“He
asked
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch?”

Catelyn
said
nothing.
Let
Ned
work
it
out
in
his
own
mind;
her
voice
would
not
be
welcome
now.
Yet
gladly
would
she
have
kissed
the
maester
just
then.
His
was
the
perfect
solution.
Benjen
Stark
was
a
Sworn
Brother.
Jon
would
be
a
son
to
him,
the
child
he
would
never
have.
And
in
time
the
boy
would
take
the
oath
as
well.
He
would
father
no
sons
who
might
someday
contest
with
Catelyn’s
own
grandchildren
for
Winterfell.

Maester
Luwin
said,
“There
is
great
honor
in
service
on
the
Wall,
my
lord.”

“And
even
a
bastard
may
rise
high
in
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Ned
reflected.
Still,
his
voice
was
troubled.
“Jon
is
so
young.
If
he
asked
this
when
he
was
a
man
grown,
that
would
be
one
thing,
but
a
boy
of
fourteen…”

“A
hard
sacrifice,”
Maester
Luwin
agreed.
“Yet
these
are
hard
times,
my
lord.
His
road
is
no
crueler
than
yours
or
your
lady’s.”

Catelyn
thought
of
the
three
children
she
must
lose.
It
was
not
easy
keeping
silent
then.

Ned
turned
away
from
them
to
gaze
out
the
window,
his
long
face
silent
and
thoughtful.
Finally
he
sighed,
and
turned
back.
“Very
well,”
he
said
to
Maester
Luwin.
“I
suppose
it
is
for
the
best.
I
will
speak
to
Ben.”

“When
shall
we
tell
Jon?”
the
maester
asked.

“When
I
must.
Preparations
must
be
made.
It
will
be
a
fortnight
before
we
are
ready
to
depart.
I
would
sooner
let
Jon
enjoy
these
last
few
days.
Summer
will
end
soon
enough,
and
childhood
as
well.
When
the
time
comes,
I
will
tell
him
myself.”





ARYA

Arya’s
stitches
were
crooked
again.

She
frowned
down
at
them
with
dismay
and
glanced
over
to
where
her
sister
Sansa
sat
among
the
other
girls.
Sansa’s
needlework
was
exquisite.
Everyone
said
so.
“Sansa’s
work
is
as
pretty
as
she
is,”
Septa
Mordane
told
their
lady
mother
once.
“She
has
such
fine,
delicate
hands.”
When
Lady
Catelyn
had
asked
about
Arya,
the
septa
had
sniffed.
“Arya
has
the
hands
of
a
blacksmith.”

Arya
glanced
furtively
across
the
room,
worried
that
Septa
Mordane
might
have
read
her
thoughts,
but
the
septa
was
paying
her
no
attention
today.
She
was
sitting
with
the
Princess
Myrcella,
all
smiles
and
admiration.
It
was
not
often
that
the
septa
was
privileged
to
instruct
a
royal
princess
in
the
womanly
arts,
as
she
had
said
when
the
queen
brought
Myrcella
to
join
them.
Arya
thought
that
Myrcella’s
stitches
looked
a
little
crooked
too,
but
you
would
never
know
it
from
the
way
Septa
Mordane
was
cooing.

She
studied
her
own
work
again,
looking
for
some
way
to
salvage
it,
then
sighed
and
put
down
the
needle.
She
looked
glumly
at
her
sister.
Sansa
was
chatting
away
happily
as
she
worked.
Beth
Cassel,
Ser
Rodrik’s
little
girl,
was
sitting
by
her
feet,
listening
to
every
word
she
said,
and
Jeyne
Poole
was
leaning
over
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear.

“What
are
you
talking
about?”
Arya
asked
suddenly.

Jeyne
gave
her
a
startled
look,
then
giggled.
Sansa
looked
abashed.
Beth
blushed.
No
one
answered.

“Tell
me,”
Arya
said.

Jeyne
glanced
over
to
make
certain
that
Septa
Mordane
was
not
listening.
Myrcella
said
something
then,
and
the
septa
laughed
along
with
the
rest
of
the
ladies.

“We
were
talking
about
the
prince,”
Sansa
said,
her
voice
soft
as
a
kiss.

Arya
knew
which
prince
she
meant:
Jofftey,
of
course.
The
tall,
handsome
one.
Sansa
got
to
sit
with
him
at
the
feast.
Arya
had
to
sit
with
the
little
fat
one.
Naturally.

“Joffrey
likes
your
sister,”
Jeyne
whispered,
proud
as
if
she
had
something
to
do
with
it.
She
was
the
daughter
of
Winterfell’s
steward
and
Sansa’s
dearest
friend.
“He
told
her
she
was
very
beautiful.”

“He’s
going
to
marry
her,”
little
Beth
said
dreamily,
hugging
herself.
“Then
Sansa
will
be
queen
of
all
the
realm.”

Sansa
had
the
grace
to
blush.
She
blushed
prettily.
She
did
everything
prettily,
Arya
thought
with
dull
resentment.
“Beth,
you
shouldn’t
make
up
stories,”
Sansa
corrected
the
younger
girl,
gently
stroking
her
hair
to
take
the
harshness
out
of
her
words.
She
looked
at
Arya.
“What
did
you
think
of
Prince
Joff,
sister?
He’s
very
gallant,
don’t
you
think?”

“Jon
says
he
looks
like
a
girl,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
sighed
as
she
stitched.
“Poor
Jon,”
she
said.
“He
gets
jealous
because
he’s
a
bastard.”

“He’s
our
brother,”
Arya
said,
much
too
loudly.
Her
voice
cut
through
the
afternoon
quiet
of
the
tower
room.

Septa
Mordane
raised
her
eyes.
She
had
a
bony
face,
sharp
eyes,
and
a
thin
lipless
mouth
made
for
frowning.
It
was
frowning
now.
“What
are
you
talking
about,
children?”

“Our
half
brother,”
Sansa
corrected,
soft
and
precise.
She
smiled
for
the
septa.
“Arya
and
I
were
remarking
on
how
pleased
we
were
to
have
the
princess
with
us
today,”
she
said.

Septa
Mordane
nodded.
“Indeed.
A
great
honor
for
us
all.”
Princess
Myrcella
smiled
uncertainly
at
the
compliment.
“Arya,
why
aren’t
you
at
work?”
the
septa
asked.
She
rose
to
her
feet,
starched
skirts
rustling
as
she
started
across
the
room.
“Let
me
see
your
stitches.”

Arya
wanted
to
scream.
It
was
just
like
Sansa
to
go
and
attract
the
septa’s
attention.
“Here,”
she
said,
surrendering
up
her
work.

The
septa
examined
the
fabric.
“Arya,
Arya,
Arya,”
she
said.
“This
will
not
do.
This
will
not
do
at
all.”

Everyone
was
looking
at
her.
It
was
too
much.
Sansa
was
too
well
bred
to
smile
at
her
sister’s
disgrace,
but
Jeyne
was
smirking
on
her
behalf.
Even
Princess
Myrcella
looked
sorry
for
her.
Arya
felt
tears
filling
her
eyes.
She
pushed
herself
out
of
her
chair
and
bolted
for
the
door.

Septa
Mordane
called
after
her.
“Arya,
come
back
here!
Don’t
you
take
another
step!
Your
lady
mother
will
hear
of
this.
In
front
of
our
royal
princess
too!
You’ll
shame
us
all!”

Arya
stopped
at
the
door
and
turned
back,
biting
her
lip.
The
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
now.
She
managed
a
stiff
little
bow
to
Myrcella.
“By
your
leave,
my
lady.”

Myrcella
blinked
at
her
and
looked
to
her
ladies
for
guidance.
But
if
she
was
uncertain,
Septa
Mordane
was
not.
“Just
where
do
you
think
you
are
going,
Arya?”
the
septa
demanded.

Arya
glared
at
her.
“I
have
to
go
shoe
a
horse,”
she
said
sweetly,
taking
a
brief
satisfaction
in
the
shock
on
the
septa’s
face.
Then
she
whirled
and
made
her
exit,
running
down
the
steps
as
fast
as
her
feet
would
take
her.

It
wasn’t
fair.
Sansa
had
everything.
Sansa
was
two
years
older;
maybe
by
the
time
Arya
had
been
born,
there
had
been
nothing
left.
Often
it
felt
that
way.
Sansa
could
sew
and
dance
and
sing.
She
wrote
poetry.
She
knew
how
to
dress.
She
played
the
high
harp
and
the
bells.
Worse,
she
was
beautiful.
Sansa
had
gotten
their
mother’s
fine
high
cheekbones
and
the
thick
auburn
hair
of
the
Tullys.
Arya
took
after
their
lord
father.
Her
hair
was
a
lusterless
brown,
and
her
face
was
long
and
solemn.
Jeyne
used
to
call
her
Arya
Horseface,
and
neigh
whenever
she
came
near.
It
hurt
that
the
one
thing
Arya
could
do
better
than
her
sister
was
ride
a
horse.
Well,
that
and
manage
a
household.
Sansa
had
never
had
much
of
a
head
for
figures.
If
she
did
marry
Prince
Joff,
Arya
hoped
for
his
sake
that
he
had
a
good
steward.

Nymeria
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
guardroom
at
the
base
of
the
stairs.
She
bounded
to
her
feet
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
Arya.
Arya
grinned.
The
wolf
pup
loved
her,
even
if
no
one
else
did.
They
went
everywhere
together,
and
Nymeria
slept
in
her
room,
at
the
foot
of
her
bed.
If
Mother
had
not
forbidden
it,
Arya
would
gladly
have
taken
the
wolf
with
her
to
needlework.
Let
Septa
Mordane
complain
about
her
stitches
then.

Nymeria
nipped
eagerly
at
her
hand
as
Arya
untied
her.
She
had
yellow
eyes.
When
they
caught
the
sunlight,
they
gleamed
like
two
golden
coins.
Arya
had
named
her
after
the
warrior
queen
of
the
Rhoyne,
who
had
led
her
people
across
the
narrow
sea.
That
had
been
a
great
scandal
too.
Sansa,
of
course,
had
named
her
pup
“Lady.”
Arya
made
a
face
and
hugged
the
wolfling
tight.
Nymeria
licked
her
ear,
and
she
giggled.

By
now
Septa
Mordane
would
certainly
have
sent
word
to
her
lady
mother.
If
she
went
to
her
room,
they
would
find
her.
Arya
did
not
care
to
be
found.
She
had
a
better
notion.
The
boys
were
at
practice
in
the
yard.
She
wanted
to
see
Robb
put
gallant
Prince
Joffrey
flat
on
his
back.
“Come,”
she
whispered
to
Nymeria.
She
got
up
and
ran,
the
wolf
coming
hard
at
her
heels.

There
was
a
window
in
the
covered
bridge
between
the
armory
and
the
Great
Keep
where
you
had
a
view
of
the
whole
yard.
That
was
where
they
headed.

They
arrived,
flushed
and
breathless,
to
find
Jon
seated
on
the
sill,
one
leg
drawn
up
languidly
to
his
chin.
He
was
watching
the
action,
so
absorbed
that
he
seemed
unaware
of
her
approach
until
his
white
wolf
moved
to
meet
them.
Nymeria
stalked
closer
on
wary
feet.
Ghost,
already
larger
than
his
litter
mates,
smelled
her,
gave
her
ear
a
careful
nip,
and
settled
back
down.

Jon
gave
her
a
curious
look.
“Shouldn’t
you
be
working
on
your
stitches,
little
sister?”

Arya
made
a
face
at
him.
“I
wanted
to
see
them
fight.”

He
smiled.
“Come
here,
then.”

Arya
climbed
up
on
the
window
and
sat
beside
him,
to
a
chorus
of
thuds
and
grunts
from
the
yard
below.

To
her
disappointment,
it
was
the
younger
boys
drilling.
Bran
was
so
heavily
padded
he
looked
as
though
he
had
belted
on
a
featherbed,
and
Prince
Tommen,
who
was
plump
to
begin
with,
seemed
positively
round.
They
were
huffing
and
puffing
and
hitting
at
each
other
with
padded
wooden
swords
under
the
watchful
eye
of
old
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,
the
master-at-arms,
a
great
stout
keg
of
a
man
with
magnificent
white
cheek
whiskers.
A
dozen
spectators,
man
and
boy,
were
calling
out
encouragement,
Robb’s
voice
the
loudest
among
them.
She
spotted
Theon
Greyjoy
beside
him,
his
black
doublet
emblazoned
with
the
golden
kraken
of
his
House,
a
look
of
wry
contempt
on
his
face.
Both
of
the
combatants
were
staggering.
Arya
judged
that
they
had
been
at
it
awhile.

“A
shade
more
exhausting
than
needlework,”
Jon
observed.

“A
shade
more
fun
than
needlework,”
Arya
gave
back
at
him.
Jon
grinned,
reached
over,
and
messed
up
her
hair.
Arya
flushed.
They
had
always
been
close.
Jon
had
their
father’s
face,
as
she
did.
They
were
the
only
ones.
Robb
and
Sansa
and
Bran
and
even
little
Rickon
all
took
after
the
Tullys,
with
easy
smiles
and
fire
in
their
hair.
When
Arya
had
been
little,
she
had
been
afraid
that
meant
that
she
was
a
bastard
too.
It
been
Jon
she
had
gone
to
in
her
fear,
and
Jon
who
had
reassured
her.

“Why
aren’t
you
down
in
the
yard?”
Arya
asked
him.

He
gave
her
a
half
smile.
“Bastards
are
not
allowed
to
damage
young
princes,”
he
said.
“Any
bruises
they
take
in
the
practice
yard
must
come
from
trueborn
swords.”

“Oh.”
Arya
felt
abashed.
She
should
have
realized.
For
the
second
time
today,
Arya
reflected
that
life
was
not
fair.

She
watched
her
little
brother
whack
at
Tommen.
“I
could
do
just
as
good
as
Bran,”
she
said.
“He’s
only
seven.
I’m
nine.”

Jon
looked
her
over
with
all
his
fourteen-year-old
wisdom.
“You’re
too
skinny,”
he
said.
He
took
her
arm
to
feel
her
muscle.
Then
he
sighed
and
shook
his
head.
“I
doubt
you
could
even
lift
a
longsword,
little
sister,
never
mind
swing
one.”

Arya
snatched
back
her
arm
and
glared
at
him.
Jon
messed
up
her
hair
again.
They
watched
Bran
and
Tommen
circle
each
other.

“You
see
Prince
Joffrey?”
Jon
asked.

She
hadn’t,
not
at
first
glance,
but
when
she
looked
again
she
found
him
to
the
back,
under
the
shade
of
the
high
stone
wall.
He
was
surrounded
by
men
she
did
not
recognize,
young
squires
in
the
livery
of
Lannister
and
Baratheon,
strangers
all.
There
were
a
few
older
men
among
them;
knights,
she
surmised.

“Look
at
the
arms
on
his
surcoat,”
Jon
suggested.

Arya
looked.
An
ornate
shield
had
been
embroidered
on
the
prince’s
padded
surcoat.
No
doubt
the
needlework
was
exquisite.
The
arms
were
divided
down
the
middle;
on
one
side
was
the
crowned
stag
of
the
royal
House,
on
the
other
the
lion
of
Lannister.

“The
Lannisters
are
proud,”
Jon
observed.
“You’d
think
the
royal
sigil
would
be
sufficient,
but
no.
He
makes
his
mother’s
House
equal
in
honor
to
the
king’s.”

“The
woman
is
important
too!”
Arya
protested.

Jon
chuckled.
“Perhaps
you
should
do
the
same
thing,
little
sister.
Wed
Tully
to
Stark
in
your
arms.”

“A
wolf
with
a
fish
in
its
mouth?”
It
made
her
laugh.
“That
would
look
silly.
Besides,
if
a
girl
can’t
fight,
why
should
she
have
a
coat
of
arms?”

Jon
shrugged.
“Girls
get
the
arms
but
not
the
swords.
Bastards
get
the
swords
but
not
the
arms.
I
did
not
make
the
rules,
little
sister.”

There
was
a
shout
from
the
courtyard
below.
Prince
Tommen
was
rolling
in
the
dust,
trying
to
get
up
and
failing.
All
the
padding
made
him
look
like
a
turtle
on
its
back.
Bran
was
standing
over
him
with
upraised
wooden
sword,
ready
to
whack
him
again
once
he
regained
his
feet.
The
men
began
to
laugh.

“Enough!”
Ser
Rodrik
called
out.
He
gave
the
prince
a
hand
and
yanked
him
back
to
his
feet.
“Well
fought.
Lew,
Donnis,
help
them
out
of
their
armor.”
He
looked
around.
“Prince
Joffrey,
Robb,
will
you
go
another
round?”

Robb,
already
sweaty
from
a
previous
bout,
moved
forward
eagerly.
“Gladly.”

Joffrey
moved
into
the
sunlight
in
response
to
Rodrik’s
summons.
His
hair
shone
like
spun
gold.
He
looked
bored.
“This
is
a
game
for
children,
Ser
Rodrik.”

Theon
Greyjoy
gave
a
sudden
bark
of
laughter.
“You
are
children,”
he
said
derisively.

“Robb
may
be
a
child,”
Joffrey
said.
“I
am
a
prince.
And
I
grow
tired
of
swatting
at
Starks
with
a
play
sword.”

“You
got
more
swats
than
you
gave,
Joff,”
Robb
said.
“Are
you
afraid?”

Prince
Joffrey
looked
at
him.
“Oh,
terrified,”
he
said.
“You’re
so
much
older.”
Some
of
the
Lannister
men
laughed.

Jon
looked
down
on
the
scene
with
a
frown.
“Joffrey
is
truly
a
little
shit,”
he
told
Arya.

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
thoughtfully
at
his
white
whiskers.
“What
are
you
suggesting?”
he
asked
the
prince.

“Live
steel.”

“Done,”
Robb
shot
back.
“You’ll
be
sorry!”

The
master-at-arms
put
a
hand
on
Robb’s
shoulder
to
quiet
him.
“Live
steel
is
too
dangerous.
I
will
permit
you
tourney
swords,
with
blunted
edges.”

Joffrey
said
nothing,
but
a
man
strange
to
Arya,
a
tall
knight
with
black
hair
and
burn
scars
on
his
face,
pushed
forward
in
front
of
the
prince.
“This
is
your
prince.
Who
are
you
to
tell
him
he
may
not
have
an
edge
on
his
sword,
ser?”

“Master-at-arms
of
Winterfell,
Clegane,
and
you
would
do
well
not
to
forget
it.”

“Are
you
training
women
here?”
the
burned
man
wanted
to
know.
He
was
muscled
like
a
bull.

“I
am
training
knights,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
pointedly.
“They
will
have
steel
when
they
are
ready.
When
they
are
of
an
age.”

The
burned
man
looked
at
Robb.
“How
old
are
you,
boy?”

“Fourteen,”
Robb
said.

“I
killed
a
man
at
twelve.
You
can
be
sure
it
was
not
with
a
blunt
sword.”

Arya
could
see
Robb
bristle.
His
pride
was
wounded.
He
turned
on
Ser
Rodrik.
“Let
me
do
it.
I
can
beat
him.”

“Beat
him
with
a
tourney
blade,
then,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

Joffrey
shrugged.
“Come
and
see
me
when
you’re
older,
Stark.
If
you’re
not
too
old.”
There
was
laughter
from
the
Lannister
men.

Robb’s
curses
rang
through
the
yard.
Arya
covered
her
mouth
in
shock.
Theon
Greyjoy
seized
Robb’s
arm
to
keep
him
away
from
the
prince.
Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers
in
dismay.

Joffrey
feigned
a
yawn
and
turned
to
his
younger
brother.
“Come,
Tommen,”
he
said.
“The
hour
of
play
is
done.
Leave
the
children
to
their
frolics.”

That
brought
more
laughter
from
the
Lannisters,
more
curses
from
Robb.
Ser
Rodrik’s
face
was
beet-red
with
fury
under
the
white
of
his
whiskers.
Theon
kept
Robb
locked
in
an
iron
grip
until
the
princes
and
their
party
were
safely
away.

Jon
watched
them
leave,
and
Arya
watched
Jon.
His
face
had
grown
as
still
as
the
pool
at
the
heart
of
the
godswood.
Finally
he
climbed
down
off
the
window.
“The
show
is
done,”
he
said.
He
bent
to
scratch
Ghost
behind
the
ears.
The
white
wolf
rose
and
rubbed
against
him.
“You
had
best
run
back
to
your
room,
little
sister.
Septa
Mordane
will
surely
be
lurking.
The
longer
you
hide,
the
sterner
the
penance.
You’ll
be
sewing
all
through
winter.
When
the
spring
thaw
comes,
they
will
find
your
body
with
a
needle
still
locked
tight
between
your
frozen
fingers.”

Arya
didn’t
think
it
was
funny.
“I
hate
needlework!”
she
said
with
passion.
“It’s
not
fair!”

“Nothing
is
fair,”
Jon
said.
He
messed
up
her
hair
again
and
walked
away
from
her,
Ghost
moving
silently
beside
him.
Nymeria
started
to
follow
too,
then
stopped
and
came
back
when
she
saw
that
Arya
was
not
coming.

Reluctantly
she
turned
in
the
other
direction.

It
was
worse
than
Jon
had
thought.
It
wasn’t
Septa
Mordane
waiting
in
her
room.
It
was
Septa
Mordane
and
her
mother.





BRAN

The
hunt
left
at
dawn.
The
king
wanted
wild
boar
at
the
feast
tonight.
Prince
Joffrey
rode
with
his
father,
so
Robb
had
been
allowed
to
join
the
hunters
as
well.
Uncle
Benjen,
Jory,
Theon
Greyjoy,
Ser
Rodrik,
and
even
the
queen’s
funny
little
brother
had
all
ridden
out
with
them.
It
was
the
last
hunt,
after
all.
On
the
morrow
they
left
for
the
south.

Bran
had
been
left
behind
with
Jon
and
the
girls
and
Rickon.
But
Rickon
was
only
a
baby
and
the
girls
were
only
girls
and
Jon
and
his
wolf
were
nowhere
to
be
found.
Bran
did
not
look
for
him
very
hard.
He
thought
Jon
was
angry
at
him.
Jon
seemed
to
be
angry
at
everyone
these
days.
Bran
did
not
know
why.
He
was
going
with
Uncle
Ben
to
the
Wall,
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch.
That
was
almost
as
good
as
going
south
with
the
king.
Robb
was
the
one
they
were
leaving
behind,
not
Jon.

For
days,
Bran
could
scarcely
wait
to
be
off.
He
was
going
to
ride
the
kingsroad
on
a
horse
of
his
own,
not
a
pony
but
a
real
horse.
His
father
would
be
the
Hand
of
the
King,
and
they
were
going
to
live
in
the
red
castle
at
King’s
Landing,
the
castle
the
Dragonlords
had
built.
Old
Nan
said
there
were
ghosts
there,
and
dungeons
where
terrible
things
had
been
done,
and
dragon
heads
on
the
walls.
It
gave
Bran
a
shiver
just
to
think
of
it,
but
he
was
not
afraid.
How
could
he
be
afraid?
His
father
would
be
with
him,
and
the
king
with
all
his
knights
and
sworn
swords.

Bran
was
going
to
be
a
knight
himself
someday,
one
of
the
Kingsguard.
Old
Nan
said
they
were
the
finest
swords
in
all
the
realm.
There
were
only
seven
of
them,
and
they
wore
white
armor
and
had
no
wives
or
children,
but
lived
only
to
serve
the
king.
Bran
knew
all
the
stories.
Their
names
were
like
music
to
him.
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield.
Ser
Ryam
Redwyne.
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight.
The
twins
Ser
Erryk
and
Ser
Arryk,
who
had
died
on
one
another’s
swords
hundreds
of
years
ago,
when
brother
fought
sister
in
the
war
the
singers
called
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons.
The
White
Bull,
Gerold
Hightower.
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
Barristan
the
Bold.

Two
of
the
Kingsguard
had
come
north
with
King
Robert.
Bran
had
watched
them
with
fascination,
never
quite
daring
to
speak
to
them.
Ser
Boros
was
a
bald
man
with
a
jowly
face,
and
Ser
Meryn
had
droopy
eyes
and
a
beard
the
color
of
rust.
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
looked
more
like
the
knights
in
the
stories,
and
he
was
of
the
Kingsguard
too,
but
Robb
said
he
had
killed
the
old
mad
king
and
shouldn’t
count
anymore.
The
greatest
living
knight
was
Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
Barristan
the
Bold,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.
Father
had
promised
that
they
would
meet
Ser
Barristan
when
they
reached
King’s
Landing,
and
Bran
had
been
marking
the
days
on
his
wall,
eager
to
depart,
to
see
a
world
he
had
only
dreamed
of
and
begin
a
life
he
could
scarcely
imagine.

Yet
now
that
the
last
day
was
at
hand,
suddenly
Bran
felt
lost.
Winterfell
had
been
the
only
home
he
had
ever
known.
His
father
had
told
him
that
he
ought
to
say
his
farewells
today,
and
he
had
tried.
After
the
hunt
had
ridden
out,
he
wandered
through
the
castle
with
his
wolf
at
his
side,
intending
to
visit
the
ones
who
would
be
left
behind,
Old
Nan
and
Gage
the
cook,
Mikken
in
his
smithy,
Hodor
the
stableboy
who
smiled
so
much
and
took
care
of
his
pony
and
never
said
anything
but
“Hodor,”
the
man
in
the
glass
gardens
who
gave
him
a
blackberry
when
he
came
to
visit…

But
it
was
no
good.
He
had
gone
to
the
stable
first,
and
seen
his
pony
there
in
its
stall,
except
it
wasn’t
his
pony
anymore,
he
was
getting
a
real
horse
and
leaving
the
pony
behind,
and
all
of
a
sudden
Bran
just
wanted
to
sit
down
and
cry.
He
turned
and
ran
off
before
Hodor
and
the
other
stableboys
could
see
the
tears
in
his
eyes.
That
was
the
end
of
his
farewells.
Instead
Bran
spent
the
morning
alone
in
the
godswood,
trying
to
teach
his
wolf
to
fetch
a
stick,
and
failing.
The
wolfling
was
smarter
than
any
of
the
hounds
in
his
father’s
kennel
and
Bran
would
have
sworn
he
understood
every
word
that
was
said
to
him,
but
he
showed
very
little
interest
in
chasing
sticks.

He
was
still
trying
to
decide
on
a
name.
Robb
was
calling
his
Grey
Wind,
because
he
ran
so
fast.
Sansa
had
named
hers
Lady,
and
Arya
named
hers
after
some
old
witch
queen
in
the
songs,
and
little
Rickon
called
his
Shaggydog,
which
Bran
thought
was
a
pretty
stupid
name
for
a
direwolf.
Jon’s
wolf,
the
white
one,
was
Ghost.
Bran
wished
he
had
thought
of
that
first,
even
though
his
wolf
wasn’t
white.
He
had
tried
a
hundred
names
in
the
last
fortnight,
but
none
of
them
sounded
right.

Finally
he
got
tired
of
the
stick
game
and
decided
to
go
climbing.
He
hadn’t
been
up
to
the
broken
tower
for
weeks
with
everything
that
had
happened,
and
this
might
be
his
last
chance.

He
raced
across
the
godswood,
taking
the
long
way
around
to
avoid
the
pool
where
the
heart
tree
grew.
The
heart
tree
had
always
frightened
him;
trees
ought
not
have
eyes,
Bran
thought,
or
leaves
that
looked
like
hands.
His
wolf
came
sprinting
at
his
heels.
“You
stay
here,”
he
told
him
at
the
base
of
the
sentinel
tree
near
the
armory
wall.
“Lie
down.
That’s
right.
Now
stay—”

The
wolf
did
as
he
was
told.
Bran
scratched
him
behind
the
ears,
then
turned
away,
jumped,
grabbed
a
low
branch,
and
pulled
himself
up.
He
was
halfway
up
the
tree,
moving
easily
from
limb
to
limb,
when
the
wolf
got
to
his
feet
and
began
to
howl.

Bran
looked
back
down.
His
wolf
fell
silent,
staring
up
at
him
through
slitted
yellow
eyes.
A
strange
chill
went
through
him.
He
began
to
climb
again.
Once
more
the
wolf
howled.
“Quiet,”
he
yelled.
“Sit
down.
Stay.
You’re
worse
than
Mother.”
The
howling
chased
him
all
the
way
up
the
tree,
until
finally
he
jumped
off
onto
the
armory
roof
and
out
of
sight.

The
rooftops
of
Winterfell
were
Bran’s
second
home.
His
mother
often
said
that
Bran
could
climb
before
he
could
walk.
Bran
could
not
remember
when
he
first
learned
to
walk,
but
he
could
not
remember
when
he
started
to
climb
either,
so
he
supposed
it
must
be
true.

To
a
boy,
Winterfell
was
a
grey
stone
labyrinth
of
walls
and
towers
and
courtyards
and
tunnels
spreading
out
in
all
directions.
In
the
older
parts
of
the
castle,
the
halls
slanted
up
and
down
so
that
you
couldn’t
even
be
sure
what
floor
you
were
on.
The
place
had
grown
over
the
centuries
like
some
monstrous
stone
tree,
Maester
Luwin
told
him
once,
and
its
branches
were
gnarled
and
thick
and
twisted,
its
roots
sunk
deep
into
the
earth.

When
he
got
out
from
under
it
and
scrambled
up
near
the
sky,
Bran
could
see
all
of
Winterfell
in
a
glance.
He
liked
the
way
it
looked,
spread
out
beneath
him,
only
birds
wheeling
over
his
head
while
all
the
life
of
the
castle
went
on
below.
Bran
could
perch
for
hours
among
the
shapeless,
rain-worn
gargoyles
that
brooded
over
the
First
Keep,
watching
it
all:
the
men
drilling
with
wood
and
steel
in
the
yard,
the
cooks
tending
their
vegetables
in
the
glass
garden,
restless
dogs
running
back
and
forth
in
the
kennels,
the
silence
of
the
godswood,
the
girls
gossiping
beside
the
washing
well.
It
made
him
feel
like
he
was
lord
of
the
castle,
in
a
way
even
Robb
would
never
know.

It
taught
him
Winterfell’s
secrets
too.
The
builders
had
not
even
leveled
the
earth;
there
were
hills
and
valleys
behind
the
walls
of
Winterfell.
There
was
a
covered
bridge
that
went
from
the
fourth
floor
of
the
bell
tower
across
to
the
second
floor
of
the
rookery.
Bran
knew
about
that.
And
he
knew
you
could
get
inside
the
inner
wall
by
the
south
gate,
climb
three
floors
and
run
all
the
way
around
Winterfell
through
a
narrow
tunnel
in
the
stone,
and
then
come
out
on
ground
level
at
the
north
gate,
with
a
hundred
feet
of
wall
looming
over
you.
Even
Maester
Luwin
didn’t
know
that,
Bran
was
convinced.

His
mother
was
terrified
that
one
day
Bran
would
slip
off
a
wall
and
kill
himself.
He
told
her
that
he
wouldn’t,
but
she
never
believed
him.
Once
she
made
him
promise
that
he
would
stay
on
the
ground.
He
had
managed
to
keep
that
promise
for
almost
a
fortnight,
miserable
every
day,
until
one
night
he
had
gone
out
the
window
of
his
bedroom
when
his
brothers
were
fast
asleep.

He
confessed
his
crime
the
next
day
in
a
fit
of
guilt.
Lord
Eddard
ordered
him
to
the
godswood
to
cleanse
himself.
Guards
were
posted
to
see
that
Bran
remained
there
alone
all
night
to
reflect
on
his
disobedience.
The
next
morning
Bran
was
nowhere
to
be
seen.
They
finally
found
him
fast
asleep
in
the
upper
branches
of
the
tallest
sentinel
in
the
grove.

As
angry
as
he
was,
his
father
could
not
help
but
laugh.
“You’re
not
my
son,”
he
told
Bran
when
they
fetched
him
down,
“you’re
a
squirrel.
So
be
it.
If
you
must
climb,
then
climb,
but
try
not
to
let
your
mother
see
you.”

Bran
did
his
best,
although
he
did
not
think
he
ever
really
fooled
her.
Since
his
father
would
not
forbid
it,
she
turned
to
others.
Old
Nan
told
him
a
story
about
a
bad
little
boy
who
climbed
too
high
and
was
struck
down
by
lightning,
and
how
afterward
the
crows
came
to
peck
out
his
eyes.
Bran
was
not
impressed.
There
were
crows’
nests
atop
the
broken
tower,
where
no
one
ever
went
but
him,
and
sometimes
he
filled
his
pockets
with
corn
before
he
climbed
up
there
and
the
crows
ate
it
right
out
of
his
hand.
None
of
them
had
ever
shown
the
slightest
bit
of
interest
in
pecking
out
his
eyes.

Later,
Maester
Luwin
built
a
little
pottery
boy
and
dressed
him
in
Bran’s
clothes
and
flung
him
off
the
wall
into
the
yard
below,
to
demonstrate
what
would
happen
to
Bran
if
he
fell.
That
had
been
fun,
but
afterward
Bran
just
looked
at
the
maester
and
said,
“I’m
not
made
of
clay.
And
anyhow,
I
never
fall.”

Then
for
a
while
the
guards
would
chase
him
whenever
they
saw
him
on
the
roofs,
and
try
to
haul
him
down.
That
was
the
best
time
of
all.
It
was
like
playing
a
game
with
his
brothers,
except
that
Bran
always
won.
None
of
the
guards
could
climb
half
so
well
as
Bran,
not
even
Jory.
Most
of
the
time
they
never
saw
him
anyway.
People
never
looked
up.
That
was
another
thing
he
liked
about
climbing;
it
was
almost
like
being
invisible.

He
liked
how
it
felt
too,
pulling
himself
up
a
wall
stone
by
stone,
fingers
and
toes
digging
hard
into
the
small
crevices
between.
He
always
took
off
his
boots
and
went
barefoot
when
he
climbed;
it
made
him
feel
as
if
he
had
four
hands
instead
of
two.
He
liked
the
deep,
sweet
ache
it
left
in
the
muscles
afterward.
He
liked
the
way
the
air
tasted
way
up
high,
sweet
and
cold
as
a
winter
peach.
He
liked
the
birds:
the
crows
in
the
broken
tower,
the
tiny
little
sparrows
that
nested
in
cracks
between
the
stones,
the
ancient
owl
that
slept
in
the
dusty
loft
above
the
old
armory.
Bran
knew
them
all.

Most
of
all,
he
liked
going
places
that
no
one
else
could
go,
and
seeing
the
grey
sprawl
of
Winterfell
in
a
way
that
no
one
else
ever
saw
it.
It
made
the
whole
castle
Bran’s
secret
place.

His
favorite
haunt
was
the
broken
tower.
Once
it
had
been
a
watchtower,
the
tallest
in
Winterfell.
A
long
time
ago,
a
hundred
years
before
even
his
father
had
been
born,
a
lightning
strike
had
set
it
afire.
The
top
third
of
the
structure
had
collapsed
inward,
and
the
tower
had
never
been
rebuilt.
Sometimes
his
father
sent
ratters
into
the
base
of
the
tower,
to
clean
out
the
nests
they
always
found
among
the
jumble
of
fallen
stones
and
charred
and
rotten
beams.
But
no
one
ever
got
up
to
the
jagged
top
of
the
structure
now
except
for
Bran
and
the
crows.

He
knew
two
ways
to
get
there.
You
could
climb
straight
up
the
side
of
the
tower
itself,
but
the
stones
were
loose,
the
mortar
that
held
them
together
long
gone
to
ash,
and
Bran
never
liked
to
put
his
full
weight
on
them.

The
best
way
was
to
start
from
the
godswood,
shinny
up
the
tall
sentinel,
and
cross
over
the
armory
and
the
guards
hall,
leaping
roof
to
roof,
barefoot
so
the
guards
wouldn’t
hear
you
overhead.
That
brought
you
up
to
the
blind
side
of
the
First
Keep,
the
oldest
part
of
the
castle,
a
squat
round
fortress
that
was
taller
than
it
looked.
Only
rats
and
spiders
lived
there
now
but
the
old
stones
still
made
for
good
climbing.
You
could
go
straight
up
to
where
the
gargoyles
leaned
out
blindly
over
empty
space,
and
swing
from
gargoyle
to
gargoyle,
hand
over
hand,
around
to
the
north
side.
From
there,
if
you
really
stretched,
you
could
reach
out
and
pull
yourself
over
to
the
broken
tower
where
it
leaned
close.
The
last
part
was
the
scramble
up
the
blackened
stones
to
the
eyrie,
no
more
than
ten
feet,
and
then
the
crows
would
come
round
to
see
if
you’d
brought
any
corn.

Bran
was
moving
from
gargoyle
to
gargoyle
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
when
he
heard
the
voices.
He
was
so
startled
he
almost
lost
his
grip.
The
First
Keep
had
been
empty
all
his
life.

“I
do
not
like
it,”
a
woman
was
saying.
There
was
a
row
of
windows
beneath
him,
and
the
voice
was
drifting
out
of
the
last
window
on
this
side.
“You
should
be
the
Hand.”

“Gods
forbid,”
a
man’s
voice
replied
lazily.
“It’s
not
an
honor
I’d
want.
There’s
far
too
much
work
involved.”

Bran
hung,
listening,
suddenly
afraid
to
go
on.
They
might
glimpse
his
feet
if
he
tried
to
swing
by.

“Don’t
you
see
the
danger
this
puts
us
in?”
the
woman
said.
“Robert
loves
the
man
like
a
brother.”

“Robert
can
barely
stomach
his
brothers.
Not
that
I
blame
him.
Stannis
would
be
enough
to
give
anyone
indigestion.”

“Don’t
play
the
fool.
Stannis
and
Renly
are
one
thing,
and
Eddard
Stark
is
quite
another.
Robert
will
listen
to
Stark.
Damn
them
both.
I
should
have
insisted
that
he
name
you,
but
I
was
certain
Stark
would
refuse
him.”

“We
ought
to
count
ourselves
fortunate,”
the
man
said.
“The
king
might
as
easily
have
named
one
of
his
brothers,
or
even
Littlefinger,
gods
help
us.
Give
me
honorable
enemies
rather
than
ambitious
ones,
and
I’ll
sleep
more
easily
by
night.”

They
were
talking
about
Father,
Bran
realized.
He
wanted
to
hear
more.
A
few
more
feet…
but
they
would
see
him
if
he
swung
out
in
front
of
the
window.

“We
will
have
to
watch
him
carefully,”
the
woman
said.

“I
would
sooner
watch
you,”
the
man
said.
He
sounded
bored.
“Come
back
here.”

“Lord
Eddard
has
never
taken
any
interest
in
anything
that
happened
south
of
the
Neck,”
the
woman
said.
“Never.
I
tell
you,
he
means
to
move
against
us.
Why
else
would
he
leave
the
seat
of
his
power?”

“A
hundred
reasons.
Duty.
Honor.
He
yearns
to
write
his
name
large
across
the
book
of
history,
to
get
away
from
his
wife,
or
both.
Perhaps
he
just
wants
to
be
warm
for
once
in
his
life.”

“His
wife
is
Lady
Arryn’s
sister.
It’s
a
wonder
Lysa
was
not
here
to
greet
us
with
her
accusations.”

Bran
looked
down.
There
was
a
narrow
ledge
beneath
the
window,
only
a
few
inches
wide.
He
tried
to
lower
himself
toward
it.
Too
far.
He
would
never
reach.

“You
fret
too
much.
Lysa
Arryn
is
a
frightened
cow.”

“That
frightened
cow
shared
Jon
Arryn’s
bed.”

“If
she
knew
anything,
she
would
have
gone
to
Robert
before
she
fled
King’s
Landing.”

“When
he
had
already
agreed
to
foster
that
weakling
son
of
hers
at
Casterly
Rock?
I
think
not.
She
knew
the
boy’s
life
would
be
hostage
to
her
silence.
She
may
grow
bolder
now
that
he’s
safe
atop
the
Eyrie.”

“Mothers.”
The
man
made
the
word
sound
like
a
curse.
“I
think
birthing
does
something
to
your
minds.
You
are
all
mad.”
He
laughed.
It
was
a
bitter
sound.
“Let
Lady
Arryn
grow
as
bold
as
she
likes.
Whatever
she
knows,
whatever
she
thinks
she
knows,
she
has
no
proof.”
He
paused
a
moment.
“Or
does
she?”

“Do
you
think
the
king
will
require
proof?”
the
woman
said.
“I
tell
you,
he
loves
me
not.”

“And
whose
fault
is
that,
sweet
sister?”

Bran
studied
the
ledge.
He
could
drop
down.
It
was
too
narrow
to
land
on,
but
if
he
could
catch
hold
as
he
fell
past,
pull
himself
up…
except
that
might
make
a
noise,
draw
them
to
the
window.
He
was
not
sure
what
he
was
hearing,
but
he
knew
it
was
not
meant
for
his
ears.

“You
are
as
blind
as
Robert,”
the
woman
was
saying.

“If
you
mean
I
see
the
same
thing,
yes,”
the
man
said.
“I
see
a
man
who
would
sooner
die
than
betray
his
king.”

“He
betrayed
one
already,
or
have
you
forgotten?”
the
woman
said.
“Oh,
I
don’t
deny
he’s
loyal
to
Robert,
that’s
obvious.
What
happens
when
Robert
dies
and
Joff
takes
the
throne?
And
the
sooner
that
comes
to
pass,
the
safer
we’ll
all
be.
My
husband
grows
more
restless
every
day.
Having
Stark
beside
him
will
only
make
him
worse.
He’s
still
in
love
with
the
sister,
the
insipid
little
dead
sixteen-year-old.
How
long
till
he
decides
to
put
me
aside
for
some
new
Lyanna?”

Bran
was
suddenly
very
frightened.
He
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
go
back
the
way
he
had
come,
to
find
his
brothers.
Only
what
would
he
tell
them?
He
had
to
get
closer,
Bran
realized.
He
had
to
see
who
was
talking.

The
man
sighed.
“You
should
think
less
about
the
future
and
more
about
the
pleasures
at
hand.”

“Stop
that!”
the
woman
said.
Bran
heard
the
sudden
slap
of
flesh
on
flesh,
then
the
man’s
laughter.

Bran
pulled
himself
up,
climbed
over
the
gargoyle,
crawled
out
onto
the
roof.
This
was
the
easy
way.
He
moved
across
the
roof
to
the
next
gargoyle,
right
above
the
window
of
the
room
where
they
were
talking.

“All
this
talk
is
getting
very
tiresome,
sister,”
the
man
said.
“Come
here
and
be
quiet.”

Bran
sat
astride
the
gargoyle,
tightened
his
legs
around
it,
and
swung
himself
around,
upside
down.
He
hung
by
his
legs
and
slowly
stretched
his
head
down
toward
the
window.
The
world
looked
strange
upside
down.
A
courtyard
swam
dizzily
below
him,
its
stones
still
wet
with
melted
snow.

Bran
looked
in
the
window.

Inside
the
room,
a
man
and
a
woman
were
wrestling.
They
were
both
naked.
Bran
could
not
tell
who
they
were.
The
man’s
back
was
to
him,
and
his
body
screened
the
woman
from
view
as
he
pushed
her
up
against
a
wall.

There
were
soft,
wet
sounds.
Bran
realized
they
were
kissing.
He
watched,
wide-eyed
and
frightened,
his
breath
tight
in
his
throat.
The
man
had
a
hand
down
between
her
legs,
and
he
must
have
been
hurting
her
there,
because
the
woman
started
to
moan,
low
in
her
throat.
“Stop
it,”
she
said,
“stop
it,
stop
it.
Oh,
please…”
But
her
voice
was
low
and
weak,
and
she
did
not
push
him
away.
Her
hands
buried
themselves
in
his
hair,
his
tangled
golden
hair,
and
pulled
his
face
down
to
her
breast.

Bran
saw
her
face.
Her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
mouth
was
open,
moaning.
Her
golden
hair
swung
from
side
to
side
as
her
head
moved
back
and
forth,
but
still
he
recognized
the
queen.

He
must
have
made
a
noise.
Suddenly
her
eyes
opened,
and
she
was
staring
right
at
him.
She
screamed.

Everything
happened
at
once
then.
‘
The
woman
pushed
the
man
away
wildly,
shouting
and
pointing.
Bran
tried
to
pull
himself
up,
bending
double
as
he
reached
for
the
gargoyle.
He
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry.
His
hand
scraped
uselessly
across
smooth
stone,
and
in
his
panic
his
legs
slipped,
and
suddenly
he
was
failing.
There
was
an
instant
of
vertigo,
a
sickening
lurch
as
the
window
flashed
past.
He
shot
out
a
hand,
grabbed
for
the
ledge,
lost
it,
caught
it
again
with
his
other
hand.
He
swung
against
the
building,
hard.
The
impact
took
the
breath
out
of
him.
Bran
dangled,
one-handed,
panting.

Faces
appeared
in
the
window
above
him.

The
queen.
And
now
Bran
recognized
the
man
beside
her.
They
looked
as
much
alike
as
reflections
in
a
mirror.

“He
saw
us,”
the
woman
said
shrilly.

“So
he
did,”
the
man
said.

Bran’s
fingers
started
to
slip.
He
grabbed
the
ledge
with
his
other
hand.
Fingernails
dug
into
unyielding
stone.
The
man
reached
down.
“Take
my
hand,”
he
said.
“Before
you
fall.”

Bran
seized
his
arm
and
held
on
tight
with
all
his
strength.
The
man
yanked
him
up
to
the
ledge.
“What
are
you
doing?”
the
woman
demanded.

The
man
ignored
her.
He
was
very
strong.
He
stood
Bran
up
on
the
sill.
“How
old
are
you,
boy?”

“Seven,”
Bran
said,
shaking
with
relief.
His
fingers
had
dug
deep
gouges
in
the
man’s
forearm.
He
let
go
sheepishly.

The
man
looked
over
at
the
woman.
“The
things
I
do
for
love,”
he
said
with
loathing.
He
gave
Bran
a
shove.

Screaming,
Bran
went
backward
out
the
window
into
empty
air.
There
was
nothing
to
grab
on
to.
The
courtyard
rushed
up
to
meet
him.

Somewhere
off
in
the
distance,
a
wolf
was
howling.
Crows
circled
the
broken
tower,
waiting
for
corn.





TYRION

Somewhere
in
the
great
stone
maze
of
Winterfell,
a
wolf
howled.
The
sound
hung
over
the
castle
like
a
flag
of
mourning.

Tyrion
Lannister
looked
up
from
his
books
and
shivered,
though
the
library
was
snug
and
warm.
Something
about
the
howling
of
a
wolf
took
a
man
right
out
of
his
here
and
now
and
left
him
in
a
dark
forest
of
the
mind,
running
naked
before
the
pack.

When
the
direwolf
howled
again,
Tyrion
shut
the
heavy
leatherbound
cover
on
the
book
he
was
reading,
a
hundred-year-old
discourse
on
the
changing
of
the
seasons
by
a
long-dead
maester.
He
covered
a
yawn
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
His
reading
lamp
was
flickering,
its
oil
all
but
gone,
as
dawn
light
leaked
through
the
high
windows.
He
had
been
at
it
all
night,
but
that
was
nothing
new.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
much
a
one
for
sleeping.

His
legs
were
stiff
and
sore
as
he
eased
down
off
the
bench.
He
massaged
some
life
back
into
them
and
limped
heavily
to
the
table
where
the
septon
was
snoring
softly,
his
head
pillowed
on
an
open
book
in
front
of
him.
Tyrion
glanced
at
the
title.
A
life
of
the
Grand
Maester
Aethelmure,
no
wonder.
“Chayle,”
he
said
softly.
The
young
man
jerked
up,
blinking,
confused,
the
crystal
of
his
order
swinging
wildly
on
its
silver
chain.
“I’m
off
to
break
my
fast.
See
that
you
return
the
books
to
the
shelves.
Be
gentle
with
the
Valyrian
scrolls,
the
parchment
is
very
dry.
Ayrmidon’s
Engines
of
War
is
quite
rare,
and
yours
is
the
only
complete
copy
I’ve
ever
seen.”
Chayle
gaped
at
him,
still
half-asleep.
Patiently,
Tyrion
repeated
his
instructions,
then
clapped
the
septon
on
the
shoulder
and
left
him
to
his
tasks.

Outside,
Tyrion
swallowed
a
lungful
of
the
cold
morning
air
and
began
his
laborious
descent
of
the
steep
stone
steps
that
corkscrewed
around
the
exterior
of
the
library
tower.
It
was
slow
going;
the
steps
were
cut
high
and
narrow,
while
his
legs
were
short
and
twisted.
The
rising
sun
had
not
yet
cleared
the
walls
of
Winterfell,
but
the
men
were
already
hard
at
it
in
the
yard
below.
Sandor
Clegane’s
rasping
voice
drifted
up
to
him.
“The
boy
is
a
long
time
dying.
I
wish
he
would
be
quicker
about
it.”

Tyrion
glanced
down
and
saw
the
Hound
standing
with
young
Joffrey
as
squires
swarmed
around
them.
“At
least
he
dies
quietly,”
the
prince
replied.
“It’s
the
wolf
that
makes
the
noise.
I
could
scarce
sleep
last
night.”

Clegane
cast
a
long
shadow
across
the
hard-packed
earth
as
his
squire
lowered
the
black
helm
over
his
head.
“I
could
silence
the
creature,
if
it
please
you,”
he
said
through
his
open
visor.
His
boy
placed
a
longsword
in
his
hand.
He
tested
the
weight
of
it,
slicing
at
the
cold
morning
air.
Behind
him,
the
yard
rang
to
the
clangor
of
steel
on
steel.

The
notion
seemed
to
delight
the
prince.
“Send
a
dog
to
kill
a
dog!”
he
exclaimed.
“Winterfell
is
so
infested
with
wolves,
the
Starks
would
never
miss
one.”

Tyrion
hopped
off
the
last
step
onto
the
yard.
“I
beg
to
differ,
nephew,”
he
said.
“The
Starks
can
count
past
six.
Unlike
some
princes
I
might
name.”

Joffrey
had
the
grace
at
least
to
blush.

“A
voice
from
nowhere,”
Sandor
said.
He
peered
through
his
helm,
looking
this
way
and
that.
“Spirits
of
the
air!”

The
prince
laughed,
as
he
always
laughed
when
his
bodyguard
did
this
mummer’s
farce.
Tyrion
was
used
to
it.
“Down
here.”

The
tall
man
peered
down
at
the
ground,
and
pretended
to
notice
him.
“The
little
lord
Tyrion,”
he
said.
“My
pardons.
I
did
not
see
you
standing
there.”

“I
am
in
no
mood
for
your
insolence
today.”
Tyrion
turned
to
his
nephew.
“Joffrey,
it
is
past
time
you
called
on
Lord
Eddard
and
his
lady,
to
offer
them
your
comfort.”

Joffrey
looked
as
petulant
as
only
a
boy
prince
can
look.
“What
good
will
my
comfort
do
them?”

“None,”
Tyrion
said.
“Yet
it
is
expected
of
you.
Your
absence
has
been
noted.”

“The
Stark
boy
is
nothing
to
me,”
Joffrey
said.
“I
cannot
abide
the
wailing
of
women.”

Tyrion
Lannister
reached
up
and
slapped
his
nephew
hard
across
the
face.
The
boy’s
cheek
began
to
redden.

“One
word,”
Tyrion
said,
“and
I
will
hit
you
again.”

“I’m
going
to
tell
Mother!”
Joffrey
exclaimed.

Tyrion
hit
him
again.
Now
both
cheeks
flamed.

“You
tell
your
mother,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“But
first
you
get
yourself
to
Lord
and
Lady
Stark,
and
you
fall
to
your
knees
in
front
of
them,
and
you
tell
them
how
very
sorry
you
are,
and
that
you
are
at
their
service
if
there
is
the
slightest
thing
you
can
do
for
them
or
theirs
in
this
desperate
hour,
and
that
all
your
prayers
go
with
them.
Do
you
understand?
Do
you?”

The
boy
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
cry.
Instead,
he
managed
a
weak
nod.
Then
he
turned
and
fled
headlong
from
the
yard,
holding
his
cheek.
Tyrion
watched
him
run.

A
shadow
fell
across
his
face.
He
turned
to
find
Clegane
looming
overhead
like
a
cliff.
His
soot-dark
armor
seemed
to
blot
out
the
sun.
He
had
lowered
the
visor
on
his
helm.
It
was
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
a
snarling
black
hound,
fearsome
to
behold,
but
Tyrion
had
always
thought
it
a
great
improvement
over
Clegane’s
hideously
burned
face.

“The
prince
will
remember
that,
little
lord,”
the
Hound
warned
him.
The
helm
turned
his
laugh
into
a
hollow
rumble.

“I
pray
he
does,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied.
“If
he
forgets,
be
a
good
dog
and
remind
him.”
He
glanced
around
the
courtyard.
“Do
you
know
where
I
might
find
my
brother?”

“Breaking
fast
with
the
queen.”

“Ah,”
Tyrion
said.
He
gave
Sandor
Clegane
a
perfunctory
nod
and
walked
away
as
briskly
as
his
stunted
legs
would
carry
him,
whistling.
He
pitied
the
first
knight
to
try
the
Hound
today.
The
man
did
have
a
temper.

A
cold,
cheerless
meal
had
been
laid
out
in
the
morning
room
of
the
Guest
House.
Jaime
sat
at
table
with
Cersei
and
the
children,
talking
in
low,
hushed
voices.

“Is
Robert
still
abed?”
Tyrion
asked
as
he
seated
himself,
uninvited,
at
the
table.

His
sister
peered
at
him
with
the
same
expression
of
faint
distaste
she
had
worn
since
the
day
he
was
born.
“The
king
has
not
slept
at
all,”
she
told
him.
“He
is
with
Lord
Eddard.
He
has
taken
their
sorrow
deeply
to
heart.”

“He
has
a
large
heart,
our
Robert,”
Jaime
said
with
a
lazy
smile.
There
was
very
little
that
Jaime
took
seriously.
Tyrion
knew
that
about
his
brother,
and
forgave
it.
During
all
the
terrible
long
years
of
his
childhood,
only
Jaime
had
ever
shown
him
the
smallest
measure
of
affection
or
respect,
and
for
that
Tyrion
was
willing
to
forgive
him
most
anything.

A
servant
approached.
“Bread,”
Tyrion
told
him,
“and
two
of
those
little
fish,
and
a
mug
of
that
good
dark
beer
to
wash
them
down.
Oh,
and
some
bacon.
Burn
it
until
it
turns
black.”
The
man
bowed
and
moved
off.
Tyrion
turned
back
to
his
siblings.
Twins,
male
and
female.
They
looked
very
much
the
part
this
morning.
Both
had
chosen
a
deep
green
that
matched
their
eyes.
Their
blond
curls
were
all
a
fashionable
tumble,
and
gold
ornaments
shone
at
wrists
and
fingers
and
throats.

Tyrion
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
a
twin,
and
decided
that
he
would
rather
not
know.
Bad
enough
to
face
himself
in
a
looking
glass
every
day.
Another
him
was
a
thought
too
dreadful
to
contemplate.

Prince
Tommen
spoke
up.
“Do
you
have
news
of
Bran,
Uncle?”

“I
stopped
by
the
sickroom
last
night,”
Tyrion
announced.
“There
was
no
change.
The
maester
thought
that
a
hopeful
sign.”

“I
don’t
want
Brandon
to
die,”
Tommen
said
timorously.
He
was
a
sweet
boy.
Not
like
his
brother,
but
then
Jaime
and
Tyrion
were
somewhat
less
than
peas
in
a
pod
themselves.

“Lord
Eddard
had
a
brother
named
Brandon
as
well,”
Jaime
mused.
“One
of
the
hostages
murdered
by
Targaryen.
It
seems
to
be
an
unlucky
name.”

“Oh,
not
so
unlucky
as
all
that,
surely,”
Tyrion
said.
The
servant
brought
his
plate.
He
ripped
off
a
chunk
of
black
bread.

Cersei
was
studying
him
warily.
“What
do
you
mean?”

Tyrion
gave
her
a
crooked
smile.
“Why,
only
that
Tommen
may
get
his
wish.
The
maester
thinks
the
boy
may
yet
live.”
He
took
a
sip
of
beer.

Myrcella
gave
a
happy
gasp,
and
Tommen
smiled
nervously,
but
it
was
not
the
children
Tyrion
was
watching.
The
glance
that
passed
between
Jaime
and
Cersei
lasted
no
more
than
a
second,
but
he
did
not
miss
it.
Then
his
sister
dropped
her
gaze
to
the
table.
“That
is
no
mercy.
These
northern
gods
are
cruel
to
let
the
child
linger
in
such
pain.”

“What
were
the
maester’s
words?”
Jaime
asked.

The
bacon
crunched
when
he
bit
into
it.
Tyrion
chewed
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
said,
“He
thinks
that
if
the
boy
were
going
to
die,
he
would
have
done
so
already.
It
has
been
four
days
with
no
change.”

“Will
Bran
get
better,
Uncle?”
little
Myrcella
asked.
She
had
all
of
her
mother’s
beauty,
and
none
of
her
nature.

“His
back
is
broken,
little
one,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“The
fall
shattered
his
legs
as
well.
They
keep
him
alive
with
honey
and
water,
or
he
would
starve
to
death.
Perhaps,
if
he
wakes,
he
will
be
able
to
eat
real
food,
but
he
will
never
walk
again.”

“If
he
wakes,”
Cersei
repeated.
“Is
that
likely?”

“The
gods
alone
know,”
Tyrion
told
her.
“The
maester
only
hopes.”
He
chewed
some
more
bread.
“I
would
swear
that
wolf
of
his
is
keeping
the
boy
alive.
The
creature
is
outside
his
window
day
and
night,
howling.
Every
time
they
chase
it
away,
it
returns.
The
maester
said
they
closed
the
window
once,
to
shut
out
the
noise,
and
Bran
seemed
to
weaken.
When
they
opened
it
again,
his
heart
beat
stronger.”

The
queen
shuddered.
“There
is
something
unnatural
about
those
animals,”
she
said.
“They
are
dangerous.
I
will
not
have
any
of
them
coming
south
with
us.”

Jaime
said,
“You’ll
have
a
hard
time
stopping
them,
sister.
They
follow
those
girls
everywhere.”

Tyrion
started
on
his
fish.
“Are
you
leaving
soon,
then?”

“Not
near
soon
enough,”
Cersei
said.
Then
she
frowned.
“Are
we
leaving?”
she
echoed.
“What
about
you?
Gods,
don’t
tell
me
you
are
staying
here?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“Benjen
Stark
is
returning
to
the
Night’s
Watch
with
his
brother’s
bastard.
I
have
a
mind
to
go
with
them
and
see
this
Wall
we
have
all
heard
so
much
of.”

Jaime
smiled.
“I
hope
you’re
not
thinking
of
taking
the
black
on
us,
sweet
brother.”

Tyrion
laughed.
“What,
me,
celibate?
The
whores
would
go
begging
from
Dorne
to
Casterly
Rock.
No,
I
just
want
to
stand
on
top
of
the
Wall
and
piss
off
the
edge
of
the
world.”

Cersei
stood
abruptly.
“The
children
don’t
need
to
hear
this
filth.
Tommen,
Myrcella,
come.”
She
strode
briskly
from
the
morning
room,
her
train
and
her
pups
trailing
behind
her.

Jaime
Lannister
regarded
his
brother
thoughtfully
with
those
cool
green
eyes.
“Stark
will
never
consent
to
leave
Winterfell
with
his
son
lingering
in
the
shadow
of
death.”

“He
will
if
Robert
commands
it,”
Tyrion
said.
“And
Robert
will
command
it.
There
is
nothing
Lord
Eddard
can
do
for
the
boy
in
any
case.”

“He
could
end
his
torment,”
Jaime
said.
“I
would,
if
it
were
my
son.
It
would
be
a
mercy.”

“I
advise
against
putting
that
suggestion
to
Lord
Eddard,
sweet
brother,”
Tyrion
said.
“He
would
not
take
it
kindly.”

“Even
if
the
boy
does
live,
he
will
be
a
cripple.
Worse
than
a
cripple.
A
grotesque.
Give
me
a
good
clean
death.”

Tyrion
replied
with
a
shrug
that
accentuated
the
twist
of
his
shoulders.
“Speaking
for
the
grotesques,”
he
said,
“I
beg
to
differ.
Death
is
so
terribly
final,
while
life
is
full
of
possibilities.”

Jaime
smiled.
“You
are
a
perverse
little
imp,
aren’t
you?”

“Oh,
yes,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“I
hope
the
boy
does
wake.
I
would
be
most
interested
to
hear
what
he
might
have
to
say.”

His
brother’s
smile
curdled
like
sour
milk.
“Tyrion,
my
sweet
brother,”
he
said
darkly,
“there
are
times
when
you
give
me
cause
to
wonder
whose
side
you
are
on.”

Tyrion’s
mouth
was
full
of
bread
and
fish.
He
took
a
swallow
of
strong
black
beer
to
wash
it
all
down,
and
grinned
up
wolfishly
at
Jaime,
“Why,
Jaime,
my
sweet
brother,”
he
said,
“you
wound
me.
You
know
how
much
I
love
my
family.”





JON

Jon
climbed
the
steps
slowly,
trying
not
to
think
that
this
might
be
the
last
time
ever.
Ghost
padded
silently
beside
him.
Outside,
snow
swirled
through
the
castle
gates,
and
the
yard
was
all
noise
and
chaos,
but
inside
the
thick
stone
walls
it
was
still
warm
and
quiet.
Too
quiet
for
Jon’s
liking.

He
reached
the
landing
and
stood
for
a
long
moment,
afraid.
Ghost
nuzzled
at
his
hand.
He
took
courage
from
that.
He
straightened,
and
entered
the
room.

Lady
Stark
was
there
beside
his
bed.
She
had
been
there,
day
and
night,
for
close
on
a
fortnight.
Not
for
a
moment
had
she
left
Bran’s
side.
She
had
her
meals
brought
to
her
there,
and
chamber
pots
as
well,
and
a
small
hard
bed
to
sleep
on,
though
it
was
said
she
had
scarcely
slept
at
all.
She
fed
him
herself,
the
honey
and
water
and
herb
mixture
that
sustained
life.
Not
once
did
she
leave
the
room.
So
Jon
had
stayed
away.

But
now
there
was
no
more
time.

He
stood
in
the
door
for
a
moment,
afraid
to
speak,
afraid
to
come
closer.
The
window
was
open.
Below,
a
wolf
howled.
Ghost
heard
and
lifted
his
head.

Lady
Stark
looked
over.
For
a
moment
she
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him.
Finally
she
blinked.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”
she
asked
in
a
voice
strangely
flat
and
emotionless.

“I
came
to
see
Bran,”
Jon
said.
“To
say
good-bye.”

Her
face
did
not
change.
Her
long
auburn
hair
was
dull
and
tangled.
She
looked
as
though
she
had
aged
twenty
years.
“You’ve
said
it.
Now
go
away.”

Part
of
him
wanted
only
to
flee,
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
he
might
never
see
Bran
again.
He
took
a
nervous
step
into
the
room.
“Please,”
he
said.

Something
cold
moved
in
her
eyes.
“I
told
you
to
leave,”
she
said.
“We
don’t
want
you
here.”

Once
that
would
have
sent
him
running.
Once
that
might
even
have
made
him
cry.
Now
it
only
made
him
angry.
He
would
be
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
soon,
and
face
worse
dangers
than
Catelyn
Tully
Stark.
“He’s
my
brother,”
he
said.

“Shall
I
call
the
guards?”

“Call
them,”
Jon
said,
defiant.
“You
can’t
stop
me
from
seeing
him.”
He
crossed
the
room,
keeping
the
bed
between
them,
and
looked
down
on
Bran
where
he
lay.

She
was
holding
one
of
his
hands.
It
looked
like
a
claw.
This
was
not
the
Bran
he
remembered.
The
flesh
had
all
gone
from
him.
His
skin
stretched
tight
over
bones
like
sticks.
Under
the
blanket,
his
legs
bent
in
ways
that
made
Jon
sick.
His
eyes
were
sunken
deep
into
black
pits;
open,
but
they
saw
nothing.
The
fall
had
shrunken
him
somehow.
He
looked
half
a
leaf,
as
if
the
first
strong
wind
would
carry
him
off
to
his
grave.

Yet
under
the
frail
cage
of
those
shattered
ribs,
his
chest
rose
and
fell
with
each
shallow
breath.

“Bran,”
he
said,
“I’m
sorry
I
didn’t
come
before.
I
was
afraid.”
He
could
feel
the
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks.
Jon
no
longer
cared.
“Don’t
die,
Bran.
Please.
We’re
all
waiting
for
you
to
wake
up.
Me
and
Robb
and
the
girls,
everyone…”

Lady
Stark
was
watching.
She
had
not
raised
a
cry.
Jon
took
that
for
acceptance.
Outside
the
window,
the
direwolf
howled
again.
The
wolf
that
Bran
had
not
had
time
to
name.

“I
have
to
go
now,”
Jon
said.
“Uncle
Benjen
is
waiting.
I’m
to
go
north
to
the
Wall.
We
have
to
leave
today,
before
the
snows
come.”
He
remembered
how
excited
Bran
had
been
at
the
prospect
of
the
journey.
It
was
more
than
he
could
bear,
the
thought
of
leaving
him
behind
like
this.
Jon
brushed
away
his
tears,
leaned
over,
and
kissed
his
brother
lightly
on
the
lips.

“I
wanted
him
to
stay
here
with
me,”
Lady
Stark
said
softly.

Jon
watched
her,
wary.
She
was
not
even
looking
at
him.
She
was
talking
to
him,
but
for
a
part
of
her,
it
was
as
though
he
were
not
even
in
the
room.

“I
prayed
for
it,”
she
said
dully.
“He
was
my
special
boy.
I
went
to
the
sept
and
prayed
seven
times
to
the
seven
faces
of
god
that
Ned
would
change
his
mind
and
leave
him
here
with
me.
Sometimes
prayers
are
answered.”

Jon
did
not
know
what
to
say.
“It
wasn’t
your
fault,”
he
managed
after
an
awkward
silence.

Her
eyes
found
him.
They
were
full
of
poison.
“I
need
none
of
your
absolution,
bastard.”

Jon
lowered
his
eyes.
She
was
cradling
one
of
Bran’s
hands.
He
took
the
other,
squeezed
it.
Fingers
like
the
bones
of
birds.
“Good-bye,”
he
said.

He
was
at
the
door
when
she
called
out
to
him.
“Jon,”
she
said.
He
should
have
kept
going,
but
she
had
never
called
him
by
his
name
before.
He
turned
to
find
her
looking
at
his
face,
as
if
she
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time.

“Yes?”
he
said.

“It
should
have
been
you,”
she
told
him.
Then
she
turned
back
to
Bran
and
began
to
weep,
her
whole
body
shaking
with
the
sobs.
Jon
had
never
seen
her
cry
before.

It
was
a
long
walk
down
to
the
yard.

Outside,
everything
was
noise
and
confusion.
Wagons
were
being
loaded,
men
were
shouting,
horses
were
being
harnessed
and
saddled
and
led
from
the
stables.
A
light
snow
had
begun
to
fall,
and
everyone
was
in
an
uproar
to
be
off.

Robb
was
in
the
middle
of
it,
shouting
commands
with
the
best
of
them.
He
seemed
to
have
grown
of
late,
as
if
Bran’s
fall
and
his
mother’s
collapse
had
somehow
made
him
stronger.
Grey
Wind
was
at
his
side.

“Uncle
Benjen
is
looking
for
you,”
he
told
Jon.
“He
wanted
to
be
gone
an
hour
ago.”

“I
know,”
Jon
said.
“Soon.”
He
looked
around
at
all
the
noise
and
confusion.
“Leaving
is
harder
than
I
thought.”

“For
me
too,”
Robb
said.
He
had
snow
in
his
hair,
melting
from
the
heat
of
his
body.
“Did
you
see
him?”

Jon
nodded,
not
trusting
himself
to
speak.

“He’s
not
going
to
die,”
Robb
said.
“I
know
it.”

“You
Starks
are
hard
to
kill,”
Jon
agreed.
His
voice
was
flat
and
tired.
The
visit
had
taken
all
the
strength
from
him.

Robb
knew
something
was
wrong.
“My
mother…”

“She
was…
very
kind,”
Jon
told
him.

Robb
looked
relieved.
“Good.”
He
smiled.
“The
next
time
I
see
you,
you’ll
be
all
in
black.”

Jon
forced
himself
to
smile
back.
“It
was
always
my
color.
How
long
do
you
think
it
will
be?”

“Soon
enough,”
Robb
promised.
He
pulled
Jon
to
him
and
embraced
him
fiercely.
“Farewell,
Snow.”

Jon
hugged
him
back.
“And
you,
Stark.
Take
care
of
Bran.”

“I
will.”
They
broke
apart
and
looked
at
each
other
awkwardly.
“Uncle
Benjen
said
to
send
you
to
the
stables
if
I
saw
you,”
Robb
finally
said.

“I
have
one
more
farewell
to
make,”
Jon
told
him.

“Then
I
haven’t
seen
you,”
Robb
replied.
Jon
left
him
standing
there
in
the
snow,
surrounded
by
wagons
and
wolves
and
horses.
It
was
a
short
walk
to
the
armory.
He
picked
up
his
package
and
took
the
covered
bridge
across
to
the
Keep.

Arya
was
in
her
room,
packing
a
polished
ironwood
chest
that
was
bigger
than
she
was.
Nymeria
was
helping.
Arya
would
only
have
to
point,
and
the
wolf
would
bound
across
the
room,
snatch
up
some
wisp
of
silk
in
her
jaws,
and
fetch
it
back.
But
when
she
smelled
Ghost,
she
sat
down
on
her
haunches
and
yelped
at
them.

Arya
glanced
behind
her,
saw
Jon,
and
jumped
to
her
feet.
She
threw
her
skinny
arms
tight
around
his
neck.
“I
was
afraid
you
were
gone,”
she
said,
her
breath
catching
in
her
throat.
“They
wouldn’t
let
me
out
to
say
good-bye.”

“What
did
you
do
now?”
Jon
was
amused.

Arya
disentangled
herself
from
him
and
made
a
face.
“Nothing.
I
was
all
packed
and
everything.”
She
gestured
at
the
huge
chest,
no
more
than
a
third
full,
and
at
the
clothes
that
were
scattered
all
over
the
room.
“Septa
Mordane
says
I
have
to
do
it
all
over.
My
things
weren’t
properly
folded,
she
says.
A
proper
southron
lady
doesn’t
just
throw
her
clothes
inside
her
chest
like
old
rags,
she
says.”

“Is
that
what
you
did,
little
sister?”

“Well,
they’re
going
to
get
all
messed
up
anyway,”
she
said.
“Who
cares
how
they’re
folded?”

“Septa
Mordane,”
Jon
told
her.
“I
don’t
think
she’d
like
Nymeria
helping,
either.”
The
she-wolf
regarded
him
silently
with
her
dark
golden
eyes.
“It’s
just
as
well.
I
have
something
for
you
to
take
with
you,
and
it
has
to
be
packed
very
carefully.”

Her
face
lit
up.
“A
present?”

“You
could
call
it
that.
Close
the
door.”

Wary
but
excited,
Arya
checked
the
hall.
“Nymeria,
here.
Guard.”
She
left
the
wolf
out
there
to
warn
of
intruders
and
closed
the
door.
By
then
Jon
had
pulled
off
the
rags
he’d
wrapped
it
in.
He
held
it
out
to
her.

Arya’s
eyes
went
wide.
Dark
eyes,
like
his.
“A
sword,”
she
said
in
a
small,
hushed
breath.

The
scabbard
was
soft
grey
leather,
supple
as
sin.
Jon
drew
out
the
blade
slowly,
so
she
could
see
the
deep
blue
sheen
of
the
steel.
“This
is
no
toy,”
he
told
her.
“Be
careful
you
don’t
cut
yourself.
The
edges
are
sharp
enough
to
shave
with.”

“Girls
don’t
shave,”
Arya
said.

“Maybe
they
should.
Have
you
ever
seen
the
septa’s
legs?”

She
giggled
at
him.
“It’s
so
skinny.”

“So
are
you,”
Jon
told
her.
“I
had
Mikken
make
this
special.
The
bravos
use
swords
like
this
in
Pentos
and
Myr
and
the
other
Free
Cities.
It
won’t
hack
a
man’s
head
off,
but
it
can
poke
him
full
of
holes
if
you’re
fast
enough.”

“I
can
be
fast,”
Arya
said.

“You’ll
have
to
work
at
it
every
day.”
He
put
the
sword
in
her
hands,
showed
her
how
to
hold
it,
and
stepped
back.
“How
does
it
feel?
Do
you
like
the
balance?”

“I
think
so,”
Arya
said.

“First
lesson,”
Jon
said.
“Stick
them
with
the
pointy
end.”

Arya
gave
him
a
whap
on
the
arm
with
the
flat
of
her
blade.
The
blow
stung,
but
Jon
found
himself
grinning
like
an
idiot.
“I
know
which
end
to
use,”
Arya
said.
A
doubtful
look
crossed
her
face.
“Septa
Mordane
will
take
it
away
from
me.”

“Not
if
she
doesn’t
know
you
have
it,”
Jon
said.

“Who
will
I
practice
with?”

“You’ll
find
someone,”
Jon
promised
her.
“King’s
Landing
is
a
true
city,
a
thousand
times
the
size
of
Winterfell.
Until
you
find
a
partner,
watch
how
they
fight
in
the
yard.
Run,
and
ride,
make
yourself
strong.
And
whatever
you
do…”

Arya
knew
what
was
coming
next.
They
said
it
together.

“…don’t…
tell…
Sansa!”

Jon
messed
up
her
hair.
“I
will
miss
you,
little
sister.”

Suddenly
she
looked
like
she
was
going
to
cry.
“I
wish
you
were
coming
with
us.”

“Different
roads
sometimes
lead
to
the
same
castle.
Who
knows?”
He
was
feeling
better
now.
He
was
not
going
to
let
himself
be
sad.
“I
better
go.
I’ll
spend
my
first
year
on
the
Wall
emptying
chamber
pots
if
I
keep
Uncle
Ben
waiting
any
longer.”

Arya
ran
to
him
for
a
last
hug.
“Put
down
the
sword
first,”
Jon
warned
her,
laughing.
She
set
it
aside
almost
shyly
and
showered
him
with
kisses.

When
he
turned
back
at
the
door,
she
was
holding
it
again,
trying
it
for
balance.
“I
almost
forgot,”
he
told
her.
“All
the
best
swords
have
names.”

“Like
Ice,”
she
said.
She
looked
at
the
blade
in
her
hand.
“Does
this
have
a
name?
Oh,
tell
me.”

“Can’t
you
guess?”
Jon
teased.
“Your
very
favorite
thing.”

Arya
seemed
puzzled
at
first.
Then
it
came
to
her.
She
was
that
quick.
They
said
it
together:

“Needle!”

The
memory
of
her
laughter
warmed
him
on
the
long
ride
north.





DAENERYS

Daenerys
Targaryen
wed
Khal
Drogo
with
fear
and
barbaric
splendor
in
a
field
beyond
the
walls
of
Pentos,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.

Drogo
had
called
his
khalasar
to
attend
him
and
they
had
come,
forty
thousand
Dothraki
warriors
and
uncounted
numbers
of
women,
children,
and
slaves.
Outside
the
city
walls
they
camped
with
their
vast
herds,
raising
palaces
of
woven
grass,
eating
everything
in
sight,
and
making
the
good
folk
of
Pentos
more
anxious
with
every
passing
day.

“My
fellow
magisters
have
doubled
the
size
of
the
city
guard,”
Illyrio
told
them
over
platters
of
honey
duck
and
orange
snap
peppers
one
night
at
the
manse
that
had
been
Drogo’s.
The
khal
had
joined
his
khalasar,
his
estate
given
over
to
Daenerys
and
her
brother
until
the
wedding.

“Best
we
get
Princess
Daenerys
wedded
quickly
before
they
hand
half
the
wealth
of
Pentos
away
to
sellswords
and
bravos,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
jested.
The
exile
had
offered
her
brother
his
sword
the
night
Dany
had
been
sold
to
Kbal
Drogo;
Viserys
had
accepted
eagerly.
Mormont
had
been
their
constant
companion
ever
since.

Magister
Illyrio
laughed
lightly
through
his
forked
beard,
but
Viserys
did
not
so
much
as
smile.
“He
can
have
her
tomorrow,
if
he
likes,”
her
brother
said.
He
glanced
over
at
Dany,
and
she
lowered
her
eyes.
“So
long
as
he
pays
the
price.”

Illyrio
waved
a
languid
hand
in
the
air,
rings
glittering
on
his
fat
fingers.
“I
have
told
you,
all
is
settled.
Trust
me.
The
khal
has
promised
you
a
crown,
and
you
shall
have
it.”

“Yes,
but
when?”

“When
the
khal
chooses,”
Illyrio
said.
“He
will
have
the
girl
first,
and
after
they
are
wed
he
must
make
his
procession
across
the
plains
and
present
her
to
the
dosh
khaleen
at
Vaes
Dothrak.
After
that,
perhaps.
If
the
omens
favor
war.”

Viserys
seethed
with
impatience.
“I
piss
on
Dothraki
omens.
The
Usurper
sits
on
my
father’s
throne.
How
long
must
I
wait?”

Illyrio
gave
a
massive
shrug.
“You
have
waited
most
of
your
life,
great
king.
What
is
another
few
months,
another
few
years?”

Ser
Jorah,
who
had
traveled
as
far
east
as
Vaes
Dothrak,
nodded
in
agreement.
“I
counsel
you
to
be
patient,
Your
Grace.
The
Dothraki
are
true
to
their
word,
but
they
do
things
in
their
own
time.
A
lesser
man
may
beg
a
favor
from
the
khal,
but
must
never
presume
to
berate
him.”

Viserys
bristled.
“Guard
your
tongue,
Mormont,
or
I’ll
have
it
out.
I
am
no
lesser
man,
I
am
the
rightful
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
The
dragon
does
not
beg.”

Ser
Jorah
lowered
his
eyes
respectfully.
Illyrio
smiled
enigmatically
and
tore
a
wing
from
the
duck.
Honey
and
grease
ran
over
his
fingers
and
dripped
down
into
his
beard
as
he
nibbled
at
the
tender
meat.
There
are
no
more
dragons,
Dany
thought,
staring
at
her
brother,
though
she
did
not
dare
say
it
aloud.

Yet
that
night
she
dreamt
of
one.
Viserys
was
hitting
her,
hurting
her.
She
was
naked,
clumsy
with
fear.
She
ran
from
him,
but
her
body
seemed
thick
and
ungainly.
He
struck
her
again.
She
stumbled
and
fell.
“You
woke
the
dragon,”
he
screamed
as
he
kicked
her.
“You
woke
the
dragon,
you
woke
the
dragon.”
Her
thighs
were
slick
with
blood.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
whimpered.
As
if
in
answer,
there
was
a
hideous
ripping
sound
and
the
crackling
of
some
great
fire.
When
she
looked
again,
Viserys
was
gone,
great
columns
of
flame
rose
all
around,
and
in
the
midst
of
them
was
the
dragon.
It
turned
its
great
head
slowly.
When
its
molten
eyes
found
hers,
she
woke,
shaking
and
covered
with
a
fine
sheen
of
sweat.
She
had
never
been
so
afraid…

…
until
the
day
of
her
wedding
came
at
last.

The
ceremony
began
at
dawn
and
continued
until
dusk,
an
endless
day
of
drinking
and
feasting
and
fighting.
A
mighty
earthen
ramp
had
been
raised
amid
the
grass
palaces,
and
there
Dany
was
seated
beside
Khal
Drogo,
above
the
seething
sea
of
Dothraki.
She
had
never
seen
so
many
people
in
one
place,
nor
people
so
strange
and
frightening.
The
horselords
might
put
on
rich
fabrics
and
sweet
perfumes
when
they
visited
the
Free
Cities,
but
out
under
the
open
sky
they
kept
the
old
ways.
Men
and
women
alike
wore
painted
leather
vests
over
bare
chests
and
horsehair
leggings
cinched
by
bronze
medallion
belts,
and
the
warriors
greased
their
long
braids
with
fat
from
the
rendering
pits.
They
gorged
themselves
on
horseflesh
roasted
with
honey
and
peppers,
drank
themselves
blind
on
fermented
mare’s
milk
and
Illyrio’s
fine
wines,
and
spat
jests
at
each
other
across
the
fires,
their
voices
harsh
and
alien
in
Dany’s
ears.

Viserys
was
seated
just
below
her,
splendid
in
a
new
black
wool
tunic
with
a
scarlet
dragon
on
the
chest.
Illyrio
and
Ser
Jorah
sat
beside
him.
Theirs
was
a
place
of
high
honor,
just
below
the
khal’s
own
bloodriders,
but
Dany
could
see
the
anger
in
her
brother’s
lilac
eyes.
He
did
not
like
sitting
beneath
her,
and
he
fumed
when
the
slaves
offered
each
dish
first
to
the
khal
and
his
bride,
and
served
him
from
the
portions
they
refused.
He
could
do
nothing
but
nurse
his
resentment,
so
nurse
it
he
did,
his
mood
growing
blacker
by
the
hour
at
each
insult
to
his
person.

Dany
had
never
felt
so
alone
as
she
did
seated
in
the
midst
of
that
vast
horde.
Her
brother
had
told
her
to
smile,
and
so
she
smiled
until
her
face
ached
and
the
tears
came
unbidden
to
her
eyes.
She
did
her
best
to
hide
them,
knowing
how
angry
Viserys
would
be
if
he
saw
her
crying,
terrified
of
how
Khal
Drogo
might
react.
Food
was
brought
to
her,
steaming
joints
of
meat
and
thick
black
sausages
and
Dothraki
blood
pies,
and
later
fruits
and
sweetgrass
stews
and
delicate
pastries
from
the
kitchens
of
Pentos,
but
she
waved
it
all
away.
Her
stomach
was
a
roil,
and
she
knew
she
could
keep
none
of
it
down.

There
was
no
one
to
talk
to.
Khal
Drogo
shouted
commands
and
jests
down
to
his
bloodriders,
and
laughed
at
their
replies,
but
he
scarcely
glanced
at
Dany
beside
him.
They
had
no
common
language.
Dothraki
was
incomprehensible
to
her,
and
the
khal
knew
only
a
few
words
of
the
bastard
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities,
and
none
at
all
of
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
She
would
even
have
welcomed
the
conversation
of
Illyrio
and
her
brother,
but
they
were
too
far
below
to
hear
her.

So
she
sat
in
her
wedding
silks,
nursing
a
cup
of
honeyed
wine,
afraid
to
eat,
talking
silently
to
herself.
I
am
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself.
I
am
Daenerys
Stormborn,
Princess
of
Dragonstone,
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror.

The
sun
was
only
a
quarter
of
the
way
up
the
sky
when
she
saw
her
first
man
die.
Drums
were
beating
as
some
of
the
women
danced
for
the
khal.
Drogo
watched
without
expression,
but
his
eyes
followed
their
movements,
and
from
time
to
time
he
would
toss
down
a
bronze
medallion
for
the
women
to
fight
over.

The
warriors
were
watching
too.
One
of
them
finally
stepped
into
the
circle,
grabbed
a
dancer
by
the
arm,
pushed
her
down
to
the
ground,
and
mounted
her
right
there,
as
a
stallion
mounts
a
mare.
Illyrio
had
told
her
that
might
happen.
“The
Dothraki
mate
like
the
animals
in
their
herds.
There
is
no
privacy
in
a
khalasar,
and
they
do
not
understand
sin
or
shame
as
we
do.”

Dany
looked
away
from
the
coupling,
frightened
when
she
realized
what
was
happening,
but
a
second
warrior
stepped
forward,
and
a
third,
and
soon
there
was
no
way
to
avert
her
eyes.
Then
two
men
seized
the
same
woman.
She
heard
a
shout,
saw
a
shove,
and
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
the
arakhs
were
out,
long
razor-sharp
blades,
half
sword
and
half
scythe.
A
dance
of
death
began
as
the
warriors
circled
and
slashed,
leaping
toward
each
other,
whirling
the
blades
around
their
heads,
shrieking
insults
at
each
clash.
No
one
made
a
move
to
interfere.

It
ended
as
quickly
as
it
began.
The
arakhs
shivered
together
faster
than
Dany
could
follow,
one
man
missed
a
step,
the
other
swung
his
blade
in
a
flat
arc.
Steel
bit
into
flesh
just
above
the
Dothraki’s
waist,
and
opened
him
from
backbone
to
belly
button,
spilling
his
entrails
into
the
dust.
As
the
loser
died,
the
winner
took
hold
of
the
nearest
woman—not
even
the
one
they
had
been
quarreling
over—and
had
her
there
and
then.
Slaves
carried
off
the
body,
and
the
dancing
resumed.

Magister
Illyrio
had
warned
Dany
about
this
too.
“A
Dothraki
wedding
without
at
least
three
deaths
is
deemed
a
dull
affair,”
he
had
said.
Her
wedding
must
have
been
especially
blessed;
before
the
day
was
over,
a
dozen
men
had
died.

As
the
hours
passed,
the
terror
grew
in
Dany,
until
it
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
scream.
She
was
afraid
of
the
Dothraki,
whose
ways
seemed
alien
and
monstrous,
as
if
they
were
beasts
in
human
skins
and
not
true
men
at
all.
She
was
afraid
of
her
brother,
of
what
he
might
do
if
she
failed
him.
Most
of
all,
she
was
afraid
of
what
would
happen
tonight
under
the
stars,
when
her
brother
gave
her
up
to
the
hulking
giant
who
sat
drinking
beside
her
with
a
face
as
still
and
cruel
as
a
bronze
mask.

I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself
again.

When
at
last
the
sun
was
low
in
the
sky,
Khal
Drogo
clapped
his
hands
together,
and
the
drums
and
the
shouting
and
feasting
came
to
a
sudden
halt.
Drogo
stood
and
pulled
Dany
to
her
feet
beside
him.
It
was
time
for
her
bride
gifts.

And
after
the
gifts,
she
knew,
after
the
sun
had
gone
down,
it
would
be
time
for
the
first
ride
and
the
consummation
of
her
marriage.
Dany
tried
to
put
the
thought
aside,
but
it
would
not
leave
her.
She
hugged
herself
to
try
to
keep
from
shaking.

Her
brother
Viserys
gifted
her
with
three
handmaids.
Dany
knew
they
had
cost
him
nothing;
Illyrio
no
doubt
had
provided
the
girls.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
were
copper-skinned
Dothraki
with
black
hair
and
almond-shaped
eyes,
Doreah
a
fair-haired,
blue-eyed
Lysene
girl.
“These
are
no
common
servants,
sweet
sister,”
her
brother
told
her
as
they
were
brought
forward
one
by
one.
“Illyrio
and
I
selected
them
personally
for
you.
Irri
will
teach
you
riding,
Jhiqui
the
Dothraki
tongue,
and
Doreah
will
instruct
you
in
the
womanly
arts
of
love.”
He
smiled
thinly.
“She’s
very
good,
Illyrio
and
I
can
both
swear
to
that.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
apologized
for
his
gift.
“It
is
a
small
thing,
my
princess,
but
all
a
poor
exile
could
afford,”
he
said
as
he
laid
a
small
stack
of
old
books
before
her.
They
were
histories
and
songs
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
she
saw,
written
in
the
Common
Tongue.
She
thanked
him
with
all
her
heart.

Magister
Illyrio
murmured
a
command,
and
four
burly
slaves
hurried
forward,
bearing
between
them
a
great
cedar
chest
bound
in
bronze.
When
she
opened
it,
she
found
piles
of
the
finest
velvets
and
damasks
the
Free
Cities
could
produce…
and
resting
on
top,
nestled
in
the
soft
cloth,
three
huge
eggs.
Dany
gasped.
They
were
the
most
beautiful
things
she
had
ever
seen,
each
different
than
the
others,
patterned
in
such
rich
colors
that
at
first
she
thought
they
were
crusted
with
jewels,
and
so
large
it
took
both
of
her
hands
to
hold
one.
She
lifted
it
delicately,
expecting
that
it
would
be
made
of
some
fine
porcelain
or
delicate
enamel,
or
even
blown
glass,
but
it
was
much
heavier
than
that,
as
if
it
were
all
of
solid
stone.
The
surface
of
the
shell
was
covered
with
tiny
scales,
and
as
she
turned
the
egg
between
her
fingers,
they
shimmered
like
polished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
One
egg
was
a
deep
green,
with
burnished
bronze
flecks
that
came
and
went
depending
on
how
Dany
turned
it.
Another
was
pale
cream
streaked
with
gold.
The
last
was
black,
as
black
as
a
midnight
sea,
yet
alive
with
scarlet
ripples
and
swirls.
“What
are
they?”
she
asked,
her
voice
hushed
and
full
of
wonder.

“Dragon’s
eggs,
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai,”
said
Magister
Illyrio.
“The
eons
have
turned
them
to
stone,
yet
still
they
burn
bright
with
beauty.”

“I
shall
treasure
them
always.”
Dany
had
heard
tales
of
such
eggs,
but
she
had
never
seen
one,
nor
thought
to
see
one.
It
was
a
truly
magnificent
gift,
though
she
knew
that
Illyrio
could
afford
to
be
lavish.
He
had
collected
a
fortune
in
horses
and
slaves
for
his
part
in
selling
her
to
Khal
Drogo.

The
khal’s
bloodriders
offered
her
the
traditional
three
weapons,
and
splendid
weapons
they
were.
Haggo
gave
her
a
great
leather
whip
with
a
silver
handle,
Cohollo
a
magnificent
arakh
chased
in
gold,
and
Qotho
a
double-curved
dragonbone
bow
taller
than
she
was.
Magister
Illyrio
and
Ser
Jorah
had
taught
her
the
traditional
refusals
for
these
offerings.
“This
is
a
gift
worthy
of
a
great
warrior,
O
blood
of
my
blood,
and
I
am
but
a
woman.
Let
my
lord
husband
bear
these
in
my
stead.”
And
so
Khal
Drogo
too
received
his
“bride
gifts.”

Other
gifts
she
was
given
in
plenty
by
other
Dothraki:
slippers
and
jewels
and
silver
rings
for
her
hair,
medallion
belts
and
painted
vests
and
soft
furs,
sandsilks
and
jars
of
scent,
needles
and
feathers
and
tiny
bottles
of
purple
glass,
and
a
gown
made
from
the
skin
of
a
thousand
mice.
“A
handsome
gift,
Khaleesi,”
Magister
Illyrio
said
of
the
last,
after
he
had
told
her
what
it
was.
“Most
lucky.”
The
gifts
mounted
up
around
her
in
great
piles,
more
gifts
than
she
could
possibly
imagine,
more
gifts
than
she
could
want
or
use.

And
last
of
all,
Khal
Drogo
brought
forth
his
own
bride
gift
to
her.
An
expectant
hush
rippled
out
from
the
center
of
the
camp
as
he
left
her
side,
growing
until
it
had
swallowed
the
whole
khalasar.
When
he
returned,
the
dense
press
of
Dothraki
gift-givers
parted
before
him,
and
he
led
the
horse
to
her.

She
was
a
young
filly,
spirited
and
splendid.
Dany
knew
just
enough
about
horses
to
know
that
this
was
no
ordinary
animal.
There
was
something
about
her
that
took
the
breath
away.
She
was
grey
as
the
winter
sea,
with
a
mane
like
silver
smoke.

Hesitantly
she
reached
out
and
stroked
the
horse’s
neck,
ran
her
fingers
through
the
silver
of
her
mane.
Khal
Drogo
said
something
in
Dothraki
and
Magister
Illyrio
translated.
“Silver
for
the
silver
of
your
hair,
the
khal
says.”

“She’s
beautiful,”
Dany
murmured.

“She
is
the
pride
of
the
khalasar,”
Illyrio
said.
“Custom
decrees
that
the
khaleesi
must
ride
a
mount
worthy
of
her
place
by
the
side
of
the
khal.”

Drogo
stepped
forward
and
put
his
hands
on
her
waist.
He
lifted
her
up
as
easily
as
if
she
were
a
child
and
set
her
on
the
thin
Dothraki
saddle,
so
much
smaller
than
the
ones
she
was
used
to.
Dany
sat
there
uncertain
for
a
moment.
No
one
had
told
her
about
this
part.
“What
should
I
do?”
she
asked
Illyrio.

It
was
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
who
answered.
“Take
the
reins
and
ride.
You
need
not
go
far.”

Nervously
Dany
gathered
the
reins
in
her
hands
and
slid
her
feet
into
the
short
stirrups.
She
was
only
a
fair
rider;
she
had
spent
far
more
time
traveling
by
ship
and
wagon
and
palanquin
than
by
horseback.
Praying
that
she
would
not
fall
off
and
disgrace
herself,
she
gave
the
filly
the
lightest
and
most
timid
touch
with
her
knees.

And
for
the
first
time
in
hours,
she
forgot
to
be
afraid.
Or
perhaps
it
was
for
the
first
time
ever.

The
silver-grey
filly
moved
with
a
smooth
and
silken
gait,
and
the
crowd
parted
for
her,
every
eye
upon
them.
Dany
found
herself
moving
faster
than
she
had
intended,
yet
somehow
it
was
exciting
rather
than
terrifying.
The
horse
broke
into
a
trot,
and
she
smiled.
Dothraki
scrambled
to
clear
a
path.
The
slightest
pressure
with
her
legs,
the
lightest
touch
on
the
reins,
and
the
filly
responded.
She
sent
it
into
a
gallop,
and
now
the
Dothraki
were
hooting
and
laughing
and
shouting
at
her
as
they
jumped
out
of
her
way.
As
she
turned
to
ride
back,
a
firepit
loomed
ahead,
directly
in
her
path.
They
were
hemmed
in
on
either
side,
with
no
room
to
stop.
A
daring
she
had
never
known
filled
Daenerys
then,
and
she
gave
the
filly
her
head.

The
silver
horse
leapt
the
flames
as
if
she
had
wings.

When
she
pulled
up
before
Magister
Illyrio,
she
said,
“Tell
Khal
Drogo
that
he
has
given
me
the
wind.”
The
fat
Pentoshi
stroked
his
yellow
beard
as
he
repeated
her
words
in
Dothraki,
and
Dany
saw
her
new
husband
smile
for
the
first
time.

The
last
sliver
of
sun
vanished
behind
the
high
walls
of
Pentos
to
the
west
just
then.
Dany
had
lost
all
track
of
time.
Khal
Drogo
commanded
his
bloodriders
to
bring
forth
his
own
horse,
a
lean
red
stallion.
As
the
khal
was
saddling
the
horse,
Viserys
slid
close
to
Dany
on
her
silver,
dug
his
fingers
into
her
leg,
and
said,
“Please
him,
sweet
sister,
or
I
swear,
you
will
see
the
dragon
wake
as
it
has
never
woken
before.”

The
fear
came
back
to
her
then,
with
her
brother’s
words.
She
felt
like
a
child
once
more,
only
thirteen
and
all
alone,
not
ready
for
what
was
about
to
happen
to
her.

They
rode
out
together
as
the
stars
came
out,
leaving
the
khalasar
and
the
grass
palaces
behind.
Khal
Drogo
spoke
no
word
to
her,
but
drove
his
stallion
at
a
hard
trot
through
the
gathering
dusk.
The
tiny
silver
bells
in
his
long
braid
rang
softly
as
he
rode.
“I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,”
she
whispered
aloud
as
she
followed,
trying
to
keep
her
courage
up.
“I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon.”
The
dragon
was
never
afraid.

Afterward
she
could
not
say
how
far
or
how
long
they
had
ridden,
but
it
was
full
dark
when
they
stopped
at
a
grassy
place
beside
a
small
stream.
Drogo
swung
off
his
horse
and
lifted
her
down
from
hers.
She
felt
as
fragile
as
glass
in
his
hands,
her
limbs
as
weak
as
water.
She
stood
there
helpless
and
trembling
in
her
wedding
silks
while
he
secured
the
horses,
and
when
he
turned
to
look
at
her,
she
began
to
cry.

Khal
Drogo
stared
at
her
tears,
his
face
strangely
empty
of
expression.
“No,”
he
said.
He
lifted
his
hand
and
rubbed
away
the
tears
roughly
with
a
callused
thumb.

“You
speak
the
Common
Tongue,”
Dany
said
in
wonder.

“No,”
he
said
again.

Perhaps
he
had
only
that
word,
she
thought,
but
it
was
one
word
more
than
she
had
known
he
had,
and
somehow
it
made
her
feel
a
little
better.
Drogo
touched
her
hair
lightly,
sliding
the
silver-blond
strands
between
his
fingers
and
murmuring
softly
in
Dothraki.
Dany
did
not
understand
the
words,
yet
there
was
warmth
in
the
tone,
a
tenderness
she
had
never
expected
from
this
man.

He
put
his
finger
under
her
chin
and
lifted
her
head,
so
she
was
looking
up
into
his
eyes.
Drogo
towered
over
her
as
he
towered
over
everyone.
Taking
her
lightly
under
the
arms,
he
lifted
her
and
seated
her
on
a
rounded
rock
beside
the
stream.
Then
he
sat
on
the
ground
facing
her,
legs
crossed
beneath
him,
their
faces
finally
at
a
height.
“No,”
he
said.

“Is
that
the
only
word
you
know?”
she
asked
him.

Drogo
did
not
reply.
His
long
heavy
braid
was
coiled
in
the
dirt
beside
him.
He
pulled
it
over
his
right
shoulder
and
began
to
remove
the
bells
from
his
hair,
one
by
one.
After
a
moment
Dany
leaned
forward
to
help.
When
they
were
done,
Drogo
gestured.
She
understood.
Slowly,
carefully,
she
began
to
undo
his
braid.

It
took
a
long
time.
All
the
while
he
sat
there
silently,
watching
her.
When
she
was
done,
he
shook
his
head,
and
his
hair
spread
out
behind
him
like
a
river
of
darkness,
oiled
and
gleaming.
She
had
never
seen
hair
so
long,
so
black,
so
thick.

Then
it
was
his
turn.
He
began
to
undress
her.

His
fingers
were
deft
and
strangely
tender.
He
removed
her
silks
one
by
one,
carefully,
while
Dany
sat
unmoving,
silent,
looking
at
his
eyes.
When
he
bared
her
small
breasts,
she
could
not
help
herself.
She
averted
her
eyes
and
covered
herself
with
her
hands.
“No,”
Drogo
said.
He
pulled
her
hands
away
from
her
breasts,
gently
but
firmly,
then
lifted
her
face
again
to
make
her
look
at
him.
“No,”
he
repeated.

“No,”
she
echoed
back
at
him.

He
stood
her
up
then
and
pulled
her
close
to
remove
the
last
of
her
silks.
The
night
air
was
chilly
on
her
bare
skin.
She
shivered,
and
gooseflesh
covered
her
arms
and
legs.
She
was
afraid
of
what
would
come
next,
but
for
a
while
nothing
happened.
Khal
Drogo
sat
with
his
legs
crossed,
looking
at
her,
drinking
in
her
body
with
his
eyes.

After
a
while
he
began
to
touch
her.
Lightly
at
first,
then
harder.
She
could
sense
the
fierce
strength
in
his
hands,
but
he
never
hurt
her.
He
held
her
hand
in
his
own
and
brushed
her
fingers,
one
by
one.
He
ran
a
hand
gently
down
her
leg.
He
stroked
her
face,
tracing
the
curve
of
her
ears,
running
a
finger
gently
around
her
mouth.
He
put
both
hands
in
her
hair
and
combed
it
with
his
fingers.
He
turned
her
around,
massaged
her
shoulders,
slid
a
knuckle
down
the
path
of
her
spine.

It
seemed
as
if
hours
passed
before
his
hands
finally
went
to
her
breasts.
He
stroked
the
soft
skin
underneath
until
it
tingled.
He
circled
her
nipples
with
his
thumbs,
pinched
them
between
thumb
and
forefinger,
then
began
to
pull
at
her,
very
lightly
at
first,
then
more
insistently,
until
her
nipples
stiffened
and
began
to
ache.

He
stopped
then,
and
drew
her
down
onto
his
lap.
Dany
was
flushed
and
breathless,
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
chest.
He
cupped
her
face
in
his
huge
hands
and
looked
into
his
eyes.
“No?”
he
said,
and
she
knew
it
was
a
question.

She
took
his
hand
and
moved
it
down
to
the
wetness
between
her
thighs.
“Yes,”
she
whispered
as
she
put
his
finger
inside
her.





EDDARD

The
summons
came
in
the
hour
before
the
dawn,
when
the
world
was
still
and
grey.

Alyn
shook
him
roughly
from
his
dreams
and
Ned
stumbled
into
the
predawn
chill,
groggy
from
sleep,
to
find
his
horse
saddled
and
the
king
already
mounted.
Robert
wore
thick
brown
gloves
and
a
heavy
fur
cloak
with
a
hood
that
covered
his
ears,
and
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
bear
sitting
a
horse.
“Up,
Stark!”
he
roared.
“Up,
up!
We
have
matters
of
state
to
discuss.”

“By
all
means,”
Ned
said.
“Come
inside,
Your
Grace.”
Alyn
lifted
the
flap
of
the
tent.

“No,
no,
no,”
Robert
said.
His
breath
steamed
with
every
word.
“The
camp
is
full
of
ears.
Besides,
I
want
to
ride
out
and
taste
this
country
of
yours.”
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
waited
behind
him
with
a
dozen
guardsmen,
Ned
saw.
There
was
nothing
to
do
but
rub
the
sleep
from
his
eyes,
dress,
and
mount
up.

Robert
set
the
pace,
driving
his
huge
black
destrier
hard
as
Ned
galloped
along
beside
him,
trying
to
keep
up.
He
called
out
a
question
as
they
rode,
but
the
wind
blew
his
words
away,
and
the
king
did
not
hear
him.
After
that
Ned
rode
in
silence.
They
soon
left
the
kingsroad
and
took
off
across
rolling
plains
dark
with
mist.
By
then
the
guard
had
fallen
back
a
small
distance,
safely
out
of
earshot,
but
still
Robert
would
not
slow.

Dawn
broke
as
they
crested
a
low
ridge,
and
finally
the
king
pulled
up.
By
then
they
were
miles
south
of
the
main
party.
Robert
was
flushed
and
exhilarated
as
Ned
reined
up
beside
him.
“Gods,”
he
swore,
laughing,
“it
feels
good
to
get
out
and
ride
the
way
a
man
was
meant
to
ride!
I
swear,
Ned,
this
creeping
along
is
enough
to
drive
a
man
mad.”
He
had
never
been
a
patient
man,
Robert
Baratheon.
“That
damnable
wheelhouse,
the
way
it
creaks
and
groans,
climbing
every
bump
in
the
road
as
if
it
were
a
mountain…
I
promise
you,
if
that
wretched
thing
breaks
another
axle,
I’m
going
to
burn
it,
and
Cersei
can
walk!”

Ned
laughed.
“I
will
gladly
light
the
torch
for
you.”

“Good
man!”
The
king
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder.
“I’ve
half
a
mind
to
leave
them
all
behind
and
just
keep
going.”

A
smile
touched
Ned’s
lips.
“I
do
believe
you
mean
it.”

“I
do,
I
do,”
the
king
said.
“What
do
you
say,
Ned?
Just
you
and
me,
two
vagabond
knights
on
the
kingsroad,
our
swords
at
our
sides
and
the
gods
know
what
in
front
of
us,
and
maybe
a
farmer’s
daughter
or
a
tavern
wench
to
warm
our
beds
tonight.”

“Would
that
we
could,”
Ned
said,
“but
we
have
duties
now,
my
liege…
to
the
realm,
to
our
children,
I
to
my
lady
wife
and
you
to
your
queen.
We
are
not
the
boys
we
were.”

“You
were
never
the
boy
you
were,”
Robert
grumbled.
“More’s
the
pity.
And
yet
there
was
that
one
time…
what
was
her
name,
that
common
girl
of
yours?
Becca?
No,
she
was
one
of
mine,
gods
love
her,
black
hair
and
these
sweet
big
eyes,
you
could
drown
in
them.
Yours
was…
Aleena?
No.
You
told
me
once.
Was
it
Merryl?
You
know
the
one
I
mean,
your
bastard’s
mother?”

“Her
name
was
Wylla,”
Ned
replied
with
cool
courtesy,
“and
I
would
sooner
not
speak
of
her.”

“Wylla.
Yes.”
The
king
grinned.
“She
must
have
been
a
rare
wench
if
she
could
make
Lord
Eddard
Stark
forget
his
honor,
even
for
an
hour.
You
never
told
me
what
she
looked
like…”

Ned’s
mouth
tightened
in
anger.
“Nor
will
I.
Leave
it
be,
Robert,
for
the
love
you
say
you
bear
me.
I
dishonored
myself
and
I
dishonored
Catelyn,
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

“Gods
have
mercy,
you
scarcely
knew
Catelyn.”

“I
had
taken
her
to
wife.
She
was
carrying
my
child.”

“You
are
too
hard
on
yourself,
Ned.
You
always
were.
Damn
it,
no
woman
wants
Baelor
the
Blessed
in
her
bed.”
He
slapped
a
hand
on
his
knee.
“Well,
I’ll
not
press
you
if
you
feel
so
strong
about
it,
though
I
swear,
at
times
you’re
so
prickly
you
ought
to
take
the
hedgehog
as
your
sigil.”

The
rising
sun
sent
fingers
of
light
through
the
pale
white
mists
of
dawn.
A
wide
plain
spread
out
beneath
them,
bare
and
brown,
its
flatness
here
and
there
relieved
by
long,
low
hummocks.
Ned
pointed
them
out
to
his
king.
“The
barrows
of
the
First
Men.”

Robert
frowned.
“Have
we
ridden
onto
a
graveyard?”

“There
are
barrows
everywhere
in
the
north,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
told
him.
“This
land
is
old.”

“And
cold,”
Robert
grumbled,
pulling
his
cloak
more
tightly
around
himself.
The
guard
had
reined
up
well
behind
them,
at
the
bottom
of
the
ridge.
“Well,
I
did
not
bring
you
out
here
to
talk
of
graves
or
bicker
about
your
bastard.
There
was
a
rider
in
the
night,
from
Lord
Varys
in
King’s
Landing.
Here.”
The
king
pulled
a
paper
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Ned.

Varys
the
eunuch
was
the
king’s
master
of
whisperers.
He
served
Robert
now
as
he
had
once
served
Aerys
Targaryen.
Ned
unrolled
the
paper
with
trepidation,
thinking
of
Lysa
and
her
terrible
accusation,
but
the
message
did
not
concern
Lady
Arryn.
“What
is
the
source
for
this
information?”

“Do
you
remember
Ser
Jorah
Mormont?”

“Would
that
I
might
forget
him,”
Ned
said
bluntly.
The
Mormonts
of
Bear
Island
were
an
old
house,
proud
and
honorable,
but
their
lands
were
cold
and
distant
and
poor.
Ser
Jorah
had
tried
to
swell
the
family
coffers
by
selling
some
poachers
to
a
Tyroshi
slaver.
As
the
Mormonts
were
bannermen
to
the
Starks,
his
crime
had
dishonored
the
north.
Ned
had
made
the
long
journey
west
to
Bear
Island,
only
to
find
when
he
arrived
that
Jorah
had
taken
ship
beyond
the
reach
of
Ice
and
the
king’s
justice.
Five
years
had
passed
since
then.

“Ser
Jorah
is
now
in
Pentos,
anxious
to
earn
a
royal
pardon
that
would
allow
him
to
return
from
exile,”
Robert
explained.
“Lord
Varys
makes
good
use
of
him.”

“So
the
slaver
has
become
a
spy,”
Ned
said
with
distaste.
He
handed
the
letter
back.
“I
would
rather
he
become
a
corpse.”

“Varys
tells
me
that
spies
are
more
useful
than
corpses,”
Robert
said.
“Jorah
aside,
what
do
you
make
of
his
report?”

“Daenerys
Targaryen
has
wed
some
Dothraki
horselord.
What
of
it?
Shall
we
send
her
a
wedding
gift?”

The
king
frowned.
“A
knife,
perhaps.
A
good
sharp
one,
and
a
bold
man
to
wield
it.”

Ned
did
not
feign
surprise;
Robert’s
hatred
of
the
Targaryens
was
a
madness
in
him.
He
remembered
the
angry
words
they
had
exchanged
when
Tywin
Lannister
had
presented
Robert
with
the
corpses
of
Rhaegar’s
wife
and
children
as
a
token
of
fealty.
Ned
had
named
that
murder;
Robert
called
it
war.
When
he
had
protested
that
the
young
prince
and
princess
were
no
more
than
babes,
his
new-made
king
had
replied,
“I
see
no
babes.
Only
dragonspawn.”
Not
even
Jon
Arryn
had
been
able
to
calm
that
storm.
Eddard
Stark
had
ridden
out
that
very
day
in
a
cold
rage,
to
fight
the
last
battles
of
the
war
alone
in
the
south.
It
had
taken
another
death
to
reconcile
them;
Lyanna’s
death,
and
the
grief
they
had
shared
over
her
passing.

This
time,
Ned
resolved
to
keep
his
temper.
“Your
Grace,
the
girl
is
scarcely
more
than
a
child.
You
are
no
Tywin
Lannister,
to
slaughter
innocents.”
It
was
said
that
Rhaegar’s
little
girl
had
cried
as
they
dragged
her
from
beneath
her
bed
to
face
the
swords.
The
boy
had
been
no
more
than
a
babe
in
arms,
yet
Lord
Tywin’s
soldiers
had
torn
him
from
his
mother’s
breast
and
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.

“And
how
long
will
this
one
remain
an
innocent?”
Robert’s
mouth
grew
hard.
“This
child
will
soon
enough
spread
her
legs
and
start
breeding
more
dragonspawn
to
plague
me.”

“Nonetheless,”
Ned
said,
“the
murder
of
children…
it
would
be
vile…
unspeakable…”

“Unspeakable?”
the
king
roared.
“What
Aerys
did
to
your
brother
Brandon
was
unspeakable.
The
way
your
lord
father
died,
that
was
unspeakable.
And
Rhaegar…
how
many
times
do
you
think
he
raped
your
sister?
How
many
hundreds
of
times?”
His
voice
had
grown
so
loud
that
his
horse
whinnied
nervously
beneath
him.
The
king
jerked
the
reins
hard,
quieting
the
animal,
and
pointed
an
angry
finger
at
Ned.
“I
will
kill
every
Targaryen
I
can
get
my
hands
on,
until
they
are
as
dead
as
their
dragons,
and
then
I
will
piss
on
their
graves.”

Ned
knew
better
than
to
defy
him
when
the
wrath
was
on
him.
If
the
years
had
not
quenched
Robert’s
thirst
for
revenge,
no
words
of
his
would
help.
“You
can’t
get
your
hands
on
this
one,
can
you?”
he
said
quietly.

The
king’s
mouth
twisted
in
a
bitter
grimace.
“No,
gods
be
cursed.
Some
pox-ridden
Pentoshi
cheesemonger
had
her
brother
and
her
walled
up
on
his
estate
with
pointy-hatted
eunuchs
all
around
them,
and
now
he’s
handed
them
over
to
the
Dothraki.
I
should
have
had
them
both
killed
years
ago,
when
it
was
easy
to
get
at
them,
but
Jon
was
as
bad
as
you.
More
fool
I,
I
listened
to
him.”

“Jon
Arryn
was
a
wise
man
and
a
good
Hand.”

Robert
snorted.
The
anger
was
leaving
him
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come.
“This
Khal
Drogo
is
said
to
have
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
his
horde.
What
would
Jon
say
to
that?”

“He
would
say
that
even
a
million
Dothraki
are
no
threat
to
the
realm,
so
long
as
they
remain
on
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
sea,”
Ned
replied
calmly.
“The
barbarians
have
no
ships.
They
hate
and
fear
the
open
sea.”

The
king
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
saddle.
“Perhaps.
There
are
ships
to
be
had
in
the
Free
Cities,
though.
I
tell
you,
Ned,
I
do
not
like
this
marriage.
There
are
still
those
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
call
me
Usurper.
Do
you
forget
how
many
houses
fought
for
Targaryen
in
the
war?
They
bide
their
time
for
now,
but
give
them
half
a
chance,
they
will
murder
me
in
my
bed,
and
my
sons
with
me.
If
the
beggar
king
crosses
with
a
Dothraki
horde
at
his
back,
the
traitors
will
join
him.”

“He
will
not
cross,”
Ned
promised.
“And
if
by
some
mischance
he
does,
we
will
throw
him
back
into
the
sea.
Once
you
choose
a
new
Warden
of
the
East—”

The
king
groaned.
“For
the
last
time,
I
will
not
name
the
Arryn
boy
Warden.
I
know
the
boy
is
your
nephew,
but
with
Targaryens
climbing
in
bed
with
Dothraki,
I
would
be
mad
to
rest
one
quarter
of
the
realm
on
the
shoulders
of
a
sickly
child.”

Ned
was
ready
for
that.
“Yet
we
still
must
have
a
Warden
of
the
East.
If
Robert
Arryn
will
not
do,
name
one
of
your
brothers.
Stannis
proved
himself
at
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End,
surely.”

He
let
the
name
hang
there
for
a
moment.
The
king
frowned
and
said
nothing.
He
looked
uncomfortable.

“That
is,”
Ned
finished
quietly,
watching,
“unless
you
have
already
promised
the
honor
to
another.”

For
a
moment
Robert
had
the
grace
to
look
startled.
Just
as
quickly,
the
look
became
annoyance.
“What
if
I
have?”

“It’s
Jaime
Lannister,
is
it
not?”

Robert
kicked
his
horse
back
into
motion
and
started
down
the
ridge
toward
the
barrows.
Ned
kept
pace
with
him.
The
king
rode
on,
eyes
straight
ahead.
“Yes,”
he
said
at
last.
A
single
hard
word
to
end
the
matter.

“Kingslayer,”
Ned
said.
The
rumors
were
true,
then.
He
rode
on
dangerous
ground
now,
he
knew.
“An
able
and
courageous
man,
no
doubt,”
he
said
carefully,
“but
his
father
is
Warden
of
the
West,
Robert.
In
time
Ser
Jaime
will
succeed
to
that
honor.
No
one
man
should
hold
both
East
and
West.”
He
left
unsaid
his
real
concern;
that
the
appointment
would
put
half
the
armies
of
the
realm
into
the
hands
of
Lannisters.

“I
will
fight
that
battle
when
the
enemy
appears
on
the
field,”
the
king
said
stubbornly.
“At
the
moment,
Lord
Tywin
looms
eternal
as
Casterly
Rock,
so
I
doubt
that
Jaime
will
be
succeeding
anytime
soon.
Don’t
vex
me
about
this,
Ned,
the
stone
has
been
set.”

“Your
Grace,
may
I
speak
frankly?”

“I
seem
unable
to
stop
you,”
Robert
grumbled.
They
rode
through
tall
brown
grasses.

“Can
you
trust
Jaime
Lannister?”

“He
is
my
wife’s
twin,
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Kingsguard,
his
life
and
fortune
and
honor
all
bound
to
mine.”

“As
they
were
bound
to
Aerys
Targaryen’s,”
Ned
pointed
out.

“Why
should
I
mistrust
him?
He
has
done
everything
I
have
ever
asked
of
him.
His
sword
helped
win
the
throne
I
sit
on.”

His
sword
helped
taint
the
throne
you
sit
on,
Ned
thought,
but
he
did
not
permit
the
words
to
pass
his
lips.
“He
swore
a
vow
to
protect
his
king’s
life
with
his
own.
Then
he
opened
that
king’s
throat
with
a
sword.”

“Seven
hells,
someone
had
to
kill
Aerys!”
Robert
said,
reining
his
mount
to
a
sudden
halt
beside
an
ancient
barrow.
“If
Jaime
hadn’t
done
it,
it
would
have
been
left
for
you
or
me.”

“We
were
not
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
Kingsguard,”
Ned
said.
The
time
had
come
for
Robert
to
hear
the
whole
truth,
he
decided
then
and
there.
“Do
you
remember
the
Trident,
Your
Grace?”

“I
won
my
crown
there.
How
should
I
forget
it?”

“You
took
a
wound
from
Rhaegar,”
Ned
reminded
him.
“So
when
the
Targaryen
host
broke
and
ran,
you
gave
the
pursuit
into
my
hands.
The
remnants
of
Rhaegar’s
army
fled
back
to
King’s
Landing.
We
followed.
Aerys
was
in
the
Red
Keep
with
several
thousand
loyalists.
I
expected
to
find
the
gates
closed
to
us.”

Robert
gave
an
impatient
shake
of
his
head.
“Instead
you
found
that
our
men
had
already
taken
the
city.
What
of
it?”

“Not
our
men,”
Ned
said
patiently.
“Lannister
men.
The
lion
of
Lannister
flew
over
the
ramparts,
not
the
crowned
stag.
And
they
had
taken
the
city
by
treachery.”

The
war
had
raged
for
close
to
a
year.
Lords
great
and
small
had
flocked
to
Robert’s
banners;
others
had
remained
loyal
to
Targaryen.
The
mighty
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock,
the
Wardens
of
the
West,
had
remained
aloof
from
the
struggle,
ignoring
calls
to
arms
from
both
rebels
and
royalists.
Aerys
Targaryen
must
have
thought
that
his
gods
had
answered
his
prayers
when
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
appeared
before
the
gates
of
King’s
Landing
with
an
army
twelve
thousand
strong,
professing
loyalty.
So
the
mad
king
had
ordered
his
last
mad
act.
He
had
opened
his
city
to
the
lions
at
the
gate.

“Treachery
was
a
coin
the
Targaryens
knew
well,”
Robert
said.
The
anger
was
building
in
him
again.
“Lannister
paid
them
back
in
kind.
It
was
no
less
than
they
deserved.
I
shall
not
trouble
my
sleep
over
it.”

“You
were
not
there,”
Ned
said,
bitterness
in
his
voice.
Troubled
sleep
was
no
stranger
to
him.
He
had
lived
his
lies
for
fourteen
years,
yet
they
still
haunted
him
at
night.
“There
was
no
honor
in
that
conquest.”

“The
Others
take
your
honor!”
Robert
swore.
“What
did
any
Targaryen
ever
know
of
honor?
Go
down
into
your
crypt
and
ask
Lyanna
about
the
dragon’s
honor!”

“You
avenged
Lyanna
at
the
Trident,”
Ned
said,
halting
beside
the
king.
Promise
me,
Ned,
she
had
whispered.

“That
did
not
bring
her
back.”
Robert
looked
away,
off
into
the
grey
distance.
“The
gods
be
damned.
It
was
a
hollow
victory
they
gave
me.
A
crown…
it
was
the
girl
I
prayed
them
for.
Your
sister,
safe…
and
mine
again,
as
she
was
meant
to
be.
I
ask
you,
Ned,
what
good
is
it
to
wear
a
crown?
The
gods
mock
the
prayers
of
kings
and
cowherds
alike.”

“I
cannot
answer
for
the
gods,
Your
Grace…
only
for
what
I
found
when
I
rode
into
the
throne
room
that
day,”
Ned
said.
“Aerys
was
dead
on
the
floor,
drowned
in
his
own
blood.
His
dragon
skulls
stared
down
from
the
walls.
Lannister’s
men
were
everywhere.
Jaime
wore
the
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
over
his
golden
armor.
I
can
see
him
still.
Even
his
sword
was
gilded.
He
was
seated
on
the
Iron
Throne,
high
above
his
knights,
wearing
a
helm
fashioned
in
the
shape
of
a
lion’s
head.
How
he
glittered!”

“This
is
well
known,”
the
king
complained.

“I
was
still
mounted.
I
rode
the
length
of
the
hall
in
silence,
between
the
long
rows
of
dragon
skulls.
It
felt
as
though
they
were
watching
me,
somehow.
I
stopped
in
front
of
the
throne,
looking
up
at
him.
His
golden
sword
was
across
his
legs,
its
edge
red
with
a
king’s
blood.
My
men
were
filling
the
room
behind
me.
Lannister’s
men
drew
back.
I
never
said
a
word.
I
looked
at
him
seated
there
on
the
throne,
and
I
waited.
At
last
Jaime
laughed
and
got
up.
He
took
off
his
helm,
and
he
said
to
me,
‘Have
no
fear,
Stark.
I
was
only
keeping
it
warm
for
our
friend
Robert.
It’s
not
a
very
comfortable
seat,
I’m
afraid.’”

The
king
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
His
laughter
startled
a
flight
of
crows
from
the
tall
brown
grass.
They
took
to
the
air
in
a
wild
beating
of
wings.
“You
think
I
should
mistrust
Lannister
because
he
sat
on
my
throne
for
a
few
moments?”
He
shook
with
laughter
again.
“Jaime
was
all
of
seventeen,
Ned.
Scarce
more
than
a
boy.”

“Boy
or
man,
he
had
no
right
to
that
throne.”

“Perhaps
he
was
tired,”
Robert
suggested.
“Killing
kings
is
weary
work.
Gods
know,
there’s
no
place
else
to
rest
your
ass
in
that
damnable
room.
And
he
spoke
truly,
it
is
a
monstrous
uncomfortable
chair.
In
more
ways
than
one.”
The
king
shook
his
head.
“Well,
now
I
know
Jaime’s
dark
sin,
and
the
matter
can
be
forgotten.
I
am
heartily
sick
of
secrets
and
squabbles
and
matters
of
state,
Ned.
It’s
all
as
tedious
as
counting
coppers.
Come,
let’s
ride,
you
used
to
know
how.
I
want
to
feel
the
wind
in
my
hair
again.”
He
kicked
his
horse
back
into
motion
and
galloped
up
over
the
barrow,
raining
earth
down
behind
him.

For
a
moment
Ned
did
not
follow.
He
had
run
out
of
words,
and
he
was
filled
with
a
vast
sense
of
helplessness.
Not
for
the
first
time,
he
wondered
what
he
was
doing
here
and
why
he
had
come.
He
was
no
Jon
Arryn,
to
curb
the
wildness
of
his
king
and
teach
him
wisdom.
Robert
would
do
what
he
pleased,
as
he
always
had,
and
nothing
Ned
could
say
or
do
would
change
that.
He
belonged
in
Winterfell.
He
belonged
with
Catelyn
in
her
grief,
and
with
Bran.

A
man
could
not
always
be
where
he
belonged,
though.
Resigned,
Eddard
Stark
put
his
boots
into
his
horse
and
set
off
after
the
king.





TYRION

The
north
went
on
forever.

Tyrion
Lannister
knew
the
maps
as
well
as
anyone,
but
a
fortnight
on
the
wild
track
that
passed
for
the
kingsroad
up
here
had
brought
home
the
lesson
that
the
map
was
one
thing
and
the
land
quite
another.

They
had
left
Winterfell
on
the
same
day
as
the
king,
amidst
all
the
commotion
of
the
royal
departure,
riding
out
to
the
sound
of
men
shouting
and
horses
snorting,
to
the
rattle
of
wagons
and
the
groaning
of
the
queen’s
huge
wheelhouse,
as
a
light
snow
flurried
about
them.
The
kingsroad
was
just
beyond
the
sprawl
of
castle
and
town.
There
the
banners
and
the
wagons
and
the
columns
of
knights
and
freeriders
turned
south,
taking
the
tumult
with
them,
while
Tyrion
turned
north
with
Benjen
Stark
and
his
nephew.

It
had
grown
colder
after
that,
and
far
more
quiet.

West
of
the
road
were
flint
hills,
grey
and
rugged,
with
tall
watchtowers
on
their
stony
summits.
To
the
east
the
land
was
lower,
the
ground
flattening
to
a
rolling
plain
that
stretched
away
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
Stone
bridges
spanned
swift,
narrow
rivers,
while
small
farms
spread
in
rings
around
holdfasts
walled
in
wood
and
stone.
The
road
was
well
trafficked,
and
at
night
for
their
comfort
there
were
rude
inns
to
be
found.

Three
days
ride
from
Winterfell,
however,
the
farmland
gave
way
to
dense
wood,
and
the
kingsroad
grew
lonely.
The
flint
hills
rose
higher
and
wilder
with
each
passing
mile,
until
by
the
fifth
day
they
had
turned
into
mountains,
cold
blue-grey
giants
with
jagged
promontories
and
snow
on
their
shoulders.
When
the
wind
blew
from
the
north,
long
plumes
of
ice
crystals
flew
from
the
high
peaks
like
banners.

With
the
mountains
a
wall
to
the
west,
the
road
veered
north
by
northeast
through
the
wood,
a
forest
of
oak
and
evergreen
and
black
brier
that
seemed
older
and
darker
than
any
Tyrion
had
ever
seen.
“The
wolfswood,”
Benjen
Stark
called
it,
and
indeed
their
nights
came
alive
with
the
howls
of
distant
packs,
and
some
not
so
distant.
Jon
Snow’s
albino
direwolf
pricked
up
his
ears
at
the
nightly
howling,
but
never
raised
his
own
voice
in
reply.
There
was
something
very
unsettling
about
that
animal,
Tyrion
thought.

There
were
eight
in
the
party
by
then,
not
counting
the
wolf.
Tyrion
traveled
with
two
of
his
own
men,
as
befit
a
Lannister.
Benjen
Stark
had
only
his
bastard
nephew
and
some
fresh
mounts
for
the
Night’s
Watch,
but
at
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood
they
stayed
a
night
behind
the
wooden
walls
of
a
forest
holdfast,
and
there
joined
up
with
another
of
the
black
brothers,
one
Yoren.
Yoren
was
stooped
and
sinister,
his
features
hidden
behind
a
beard
as
black
as
his
clothing,
but
he
seemed
as
tough
as
an
old
root
and
as
hard
as
stone.
With
him
were
a
pair
of
ragged
peasant
boys
from
the
Fingers.
“Rapers,”
Yoren
said
with
a
cold
look
at
his
charges.
Tyrion
understood.
Life
on
the
Wall
was
said
to
be
hard,
but
no
doubt
it
was
preferable
to
castration.

Five
men,
three
boys,
a
direwolf,
twenty
horses,
and
a
cage
of
ravens
given
over
to
Benjen
Stark
by
Maester
Luwin.
No
doubt
they
made
a
curious
fellowship
for
the
kingsroad,
or
any
road.

Tyrion
noticed
Jon
Snow
watching
Yoren
and
his
sullen
companions,
with
an
odd
cast
to
his
face
that
looked
uncomfortably
like
dismay.
Yoren
had
a
twisted
shoulder
and
a
sour
smell,
his
hair
and
beard
were
matted
and
greasy
and
full
of
lice,
his
clothing
old,
patched,
and
seldom
washed.
His
two
young
recruits
smelled
even
worse,
and
seemed
as
stupid
as
they
were
cruel.

No
doubt
the
boy
had
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
Night’s
Watch
was
made
up
of
men
like
his
uncle.
If
so,
Yoren
and
his
companions
were
a
rude
awakening.
Tyrion
felt
sorry
for
the
boy.
He
had
chosen
a
hard
life…
or
perhaps
he
should
say
that
a
hard
life
had
been
chosen
for
him.

He
had
rather
less
sympathy
for
the
uncle.
Benjen
Stark
seemed
to
share
his
brother’s
distaste
for
Lannisters,
and
he
had
not
been
pleased
when
Tyrion
had
told
him
of
his
intentions.
“I
warn
you,
Lannister,
you’ll
find
no
inns
at
the
Wall,”
he
had
said,
looking
down
on
him.

“No
doubt
you’ll
find
some
place
to
put
me,”
Tyrion
had
replied.
“As
you
might
have
noticed,
I’m
small.”

One
did
not
say
no
to
the
queen’s
brother,
of
course,
so
that
had
settled
the
matter,
but
Stark
had
not
been
happy.
“You
will
not
like
the
ride,
I
promise
you
that,”
he’d
said
curtly,
and
since
the
moment
they
set
out,
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
live
up
to
that
promise.

By
the
end
of
the
first
week,
Tyrion’s
thighs
were
raw
from
hard
riding,
his
legs
were
cramping
badly,
and
he
was
chilled
to
the
bone.
He
did
not
complain.
He
was
damned
if
he
would
give
Benjen
Stark
that
satisfaction.

He
took
a
small
revenge
in
the
matter
of
his
riding
fur,
a
tattered
bearskin,
old
and
musty-smelling.
Stark
had
offered
it
to
him
in
an
excess
of
Night’s
Watch
gallantry,
no
doubt
expecting
him
to
graciously
decline.
Tyrion
had
accepted
with
a
smile.
He
had
brought
his
warmest
clothing
with
him
when
they
rode
out
of
Winterfell,
and
soon
discovered
that
it
was
nowhere
near
warm
enough.
It
was
cold
up
here,
and
growing
colder.
The
nights
were
well
below
freezing
now,
and
when
the
wind
blew
it
was
like
a
knife
cutting
right
through
his
warmest
woolens.
By
now
Stark
was
no
doubt
regretting
his
chivalrous
impulse.
Perhaps
he
had
learned
a
lesson.
The
Lannisters
never
declined,
graciously
or
otherwise.
The
Lannisters
took
what
was
offered.

Farms
and
holdfasts
grew
scarcer
and
smaller
as
they
pressed
northward,
ever
deeper
into
the
darkness
of
the
wolfswood,
until
finally
there
were
no
more
roofs
to
shelter
under,
and
they
were
thrown
back
on
their
own
resources.

Tyrion
was
never
much
use
in
making
a
camp
or
breaking
one.
Too
small,
too
hobbled,
too
in-the-way.
So
while
Stark
and
Yoren
and
the
other
men
erected
rude
shelters,
tended
the
horses,
and
built
a
fire,
it
became
his
custom
to
take
his
fur
and
a
wineskin
and
go
off
by
himself
to
read.

On
the
eighteenth
night
of
their
journey,
the
wine
was
a
rare
sweet
amber
from
the
Summer
Isles
that
he
had
brought
all
the
way
north
from
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
book
a
rumination
on
the
history
and
properties
of
dragons.
With
Lord
Eddard
Stark’s
permission,
Tyrion
had
borrowed
a
few
rare
volumes
from
the
Winterfell
library
and
packed
them
for
the
ride
north.

He
found
a
comfortable
spot
just
beyond
the
noise
of
the
camp,
beside
a
swift-running
stream
with
waters
clear
and
cold
as
ice.
A
grotesquely
ancient
oak
provided
shelter
from
the
biting
wind.
Tyrion
curled
up
in
his
fur
with
his
back
against
the
trunk,
took
a
sip
of
the
wine,
and
began
to
read
about
the
properties
of
dragonbone.
Dragonbone
is
black
because
of
its
high
iron
content,
the
book
told
him.
It
is
strong
as
steel,
yet
lighter
and
far
more
flexible,
and
of
course
utterly
impervious
to
fire.
Dragonbone
bows
are
greatly
prized
by
the
Dothraki,
and
small
wonder.
An
archer
so
armed
can
outrange
any
wooden
bow.

Tyrion
had
a
morbid
fascination
with
dragons.
When
he
had
first
come
to
King’s
Landing
for
his
sister’s
wedding
to
Robert
Baratheon,
he
had
made
it
a
point
to
seek
out
the
dragon
skulls
that
had
hung
on
the
walls
of
Targaryen’s
throne
room.
King
Robert
had
replaced
them
with
banners
and
tapestries,
but
Tyrion
had
persisted
until
he
found
the
skulls
in
the
dank
cellar
where
they
had
been
stored.

He
had
expected
to
find
them
impressive,
perhaps
even
frightening.
He
had
not
thought
to
find
them
beautiful.
Yet
they
were.
As
black
as
onyx,
polished
smooth,
so
the
bone
seemed
to
shimmer
in
the
light
of
his
torch.
They
liked
the
fire,
he
sensed.
He’d
thrust
the
torch
into
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
larger
skulls
and
made
the
shadows
leap
and
dance
on
the
wall
behind
him.
The
teeth
were
long,
curving
knives
of
black
diamond.
The
flame
of
the
torch
was
nothing
to
them;
they
had
bathed
in
the
heat
of
far
greater
fires.
When
he
had
moved
away,
Tyrion
could
have
sworn
that
the
beast’s
empty
eye
sockets
had
watched
him
go.

There
were
nineteen
skulls.
The
oldest
was
more
than
three
thousand
years
old;
the
youngest
a
mere
century
and
a
half.
The
most
recent
were
also
the
smallest;
a
matched
pair
no
bigger
than
mastiff’s
skulls,
and
oddly
misshapen,
all
that
remained
of
the
last
two
hatchlings
born
on
Dragonstone.
They
were
the
last
of
the
Targaryen
dragons,
perhaps
the
last
dragons
anywhere,
and
they
had
not
lived
very
long.

From
there
the
skulls
ranged
upward
in
size
to
the
three
great
monsters
of
song
and
story,
the
dragons
that
Aegon
Targaryen
and
his
sisters
had
unleashed
on
the
Seven
Kingdoms
of
old.
The
singers
had
given
them
the
names
of
gods:
Balerion,
Meraxes,
Vhaghar.
Tyrion
had
stood
between
their
gaping
jaws,
wordless
and
awed.
You
could
have
ridden
a
horse
down
Vhaghar’s
gullet,
although
you
would
not
have
ridden
it
out
again.
Meraxes
was
even
bigger.
And
the
greatest
of
them,
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread,
could
have
swallowed
an
aurochs
whole,
or
even
one
of
the
hairy
mammoths
said
to
roam
the
cold
wastes
beyond
the
Port
of
Ibben.

Tyrion
stood
in
that
dank
cellar
for
a
long
time,
staring
at
Balerion’s
huge,
empty-eyed
skull
until
his
torch
burned
low,
trying
to
grasp
the
size
of
the
living
animal,
to
imagine
how
it
must
have
looked
when
it
spread
its
great
black
wings
and
swept
across
the
skies,
breathing
fire.

His
own
remote
ancestor,
King
Loren
of
the
Rock,
had
tried
to
stand
against
the
fire
when
he
joined
with
King
Mern
of
the
Reach
to
oppose
the
Targaryen
conquest.
That
was
close
on
three
hundred
years
ago,
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
kingdoms,
and
not
mere
provinces
of
a
greater
realm.
Between
them,
the
Two
Kings
had
six
hundred
banners
flying,
five
thousand
mounted
knights,
and
ten
times
as
many
freeriders
and
men-at-arms.
Aegon
Dragonlord
had
perhaps
a
fifth
that
number,
the
chroniclers
said,
and
most
of
those
were
conscripts
from
the
ranks
of
the
last
king
he
had
slain,
their
loyalties
uncertain.

The
hosts
met
on
the
broad
plains
of
the
Reach,
amidst
golden
fields
of
wheat
ripe
for
harvest.
When
the
Two
Kings
charged,
the
Targaryen
army
shivered
and
shattered
and
began
to
run.
For
a
few
moments,
the
chroniclers
wrote,
the
conquest
was
at
an
end…
but
only
for
those
few
moments,
before
Aegon
Targaryen
and
his
sisters
joined
the
battle.

It
was
the
only
time
that
Vhaghar,
Meraxes,
and
Balerion
were
all
unleashed
at
once.
The
singers
called
it
the
Field
of
Fire.

Near
four
thousand
men
had
burned
that
day,
among
them
King
Mern
of
the
Reach.
King
Loren
had
escaped,
and
lived
long
enough
to
surrender,
pledge
his
fealty
to
the
Targaryens,
and
beget
a
son,
for
which
Tyrion
was
duly
grateful.

“Why
do
you
read
so
much?”

Tyrion
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
voice.
Jon
Snow
was
standing
a
few
feet
away,
regarding
him
curiously.
He
closed
the
book
on
a
finger
and
said,
“Look
at
me
and
tell
me
what
you
see.”

The
boy
looked
at
him
suspiciously.
“Is
this
some
kind
of
trick?
I
see
you.
Tyrion
Lannister.”

Tyrion
sighed.
“You
are
remarkably
polite
for
a
bastard,
Snow.
What
you
see
is
a
dwarf.
You
are
what,
twelve?”

“Fourteen,”
the
boy
said.

“Fourteen,
and
you’re
taller
than
I
will
ever
be.
My
legs
are
short
and
twisted,
and
I
walk
with
difficulty.
I
require
a
special
saddle
to
keep
from
falling
off
my
horse.
A
saddle
of
my
own
design,
you
may
be
interested
to
know.
It
was
either
that
or
ride
a
pony.
My
arms
are
strong
enough,
but
again,
too
short.
I
will
never
make
a
swordsman.
Had
I
been
born
a
peasant,
they
might
have
left
me
out
to
die,
or
sold
me
to
some
slaver’s
grotesquerie.
Alas,
I
was
born
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
grotesqueries
are
all
the
poorer.
Things
are
expected
of
me.
My
father
was
the
Hand
of
the
King
for
twenty
years.
My
brother
later
killed
that
very
same
king,
as
it
turns
out,
but
life
is
full
of
these
little
ironies.
My
sister
married
the
new
king
and
my
repulsive
nephew
will
be
king
after
him.
I
must
do
my
part
for
the
honor
of
my
House,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
Yet
how?
Well,
my
legs
may
be
too
small
for
my
body,
but
my
head
is
too
large,
although
I
prefer
to
think
it
is
just
large
enough
for
my
mind.
I
have
a
realistic
grasp
of
my
own
strengths
and
weaknesses.
My
mind
is
my
weapon.
My
brother
has
his
sword,
King
Robert
has
his
warhammer,
and
I
have
my
mind…
and
a
mind
needs
books
as
a
sword
needs
a
whetstone,
if
it
is
to
keep
its
edge.”
Tyrion
tapped
the
leather
cover
of
the
book.
“That’s
why
I
read
so
much,
Jon
Snow.”

The
boy
absorbed
that
all
in
silence.
He
had
the
Stark
face
if
not
the
name:
long,
solemn,
guarded,
a
face
that
gave
nothing
away.
Whoever
his
mother
had
been,
she
had
left
little
of
herself
in
her
son.
“What
are
you
reading
about?”
he
asked.

“Dragons,”
Tyrion
told
him.

“What
good
is
that?
There
are
no
more
dragons,”
the
boy
said
with
the
easy
certainty
of
youth.

“So
they
say,”
Tyrion
replied.
“Sad,
isn’t
it?
When
I
was
your
age,
used
to
dream
of
having
a
dragon
of
my
own.”

“You
did?”
the
boy
said
suspiciously.
Perhaps
he
thought
Tyrion
was
making
fun
of
him.

“Oh,
yes.
Even
a
stunted,
twisted,
ugly
little
boy
can
look
down
over
the
world
when
he’s
seated
on
a
dragon’s
back.”
Tyrion
pushed
the
bearskin
aside
and
climbed
to
his
feet.
“I
used
to
start
fires
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock
and
stare
at
the
flames
for
hours,
pretending
they
were
dragonfire.
Sometimes
I’d
imagine
my
father
burning.
At
other
times,
my
sister.”
Jon
Snow
was
staring
at
him,
a
look
equal
parts
horror
and
fascination.
Tyrion
guffawed.
“Don’t
look
at
me
that
way,
bastard.
I
know
your
secret.
You’ve
dreamt
the
same
kind
of
dreams.”

“No,”
Jon
Snow
said,
horrified.
“I
wouldn’t…”

“No?
Never?”
Tyrion
raised
an
eyebrow.
“Well,
no
doubt
the
Starks
have
been
terribly
good
to
you.
I’m
certain
Lady
Stark
treats
you
as
if
you
were
one
of
her
own.
And
your
brother
Robb,
he’s
always
been
kind,
and
why
not?
He
gets
Winterfell
and
you
get
the
Wall.
And
your
father…
he
must
have
good
reasons
for
packing
you
off
to
the
Night’s
Watch…”

“Stop
it,”
Jon
Snow
said,
his
face
dark
with
anger.
“The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
noble
calling!”

Tyrion
laughed.
“You’re
too
smart
to
believe
that.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
a
midden
heap
for
all
the
misfits
of
the
realm.
I’ve
seen
you
looking
at
Yoren
and
his
boys.
Those
are
your
new
brothers,
Jon
Snow,
how
do
you
like
them?
Sullen
peasants,
debtors,
poachers,
rapers,
thieves,
and
bastards
like
you
all
wind
up
on
the
Wall,
watching
for
grumkins
and
snarks
and
all
the
other
monsters
your
wet
nurse
warned
you
about.
The
good
part
is
there
are
no
grumkins
or
snarks,
so
it’s
scarcely
dangerous
work.
The
bad
part
is
you
freeze
your
balls
off,
but
since
you’re
not
allowed
to
breed
anyway,
I
don’t
suppose
that
matters.”

“Stop
it!”
the
boy
screamed.
He
took
a
step
forward,
his
hands
coiling
into
fists,
close
to
tears.

Suddenly,
absurdly,
Tyrion
felt
guilty.
He
took
a
step
forward,
intending
to
give
the
boy
a
reassuring
pat
on
the
shoulder
or
mutter
some
word
of
apology.

He
never
saw
the
wolf,
where
it
was
or
how
it
came
at
him.
One
moment
he
was
walking
toward
Snow
and
the
next
he
was
flat
on
his
back
on
the
hard
rocky
ground,
the
book
spinning
away
from
him
as
he
fell,
the
breath
going
out
of
him
at
the
sudden
impact,
his
mouth
full
of
dirt
and
blood
and
rotting
leaves.
As
he
tried
to
get
up,
his
back
spasmed
painfully.
He
must
have
wrenched
it
in
the
fall.
He
ground
his
teeth
in
frustration,
grabbed
a
root,
and
pulled
himself
back
to
a
sitting
position.
“Help
me,”
he
said
to
the
boy,
reaching
up
a
hand.

And
suddenly
the
wolf
was
between
them.
He
did
not
growl.
The
damned
thing
never
made
a
sound.
He
only
looked
at
him
with
those
bright
red
eyes,
and
showed
him
his
teeth,
and
that
was
more
than
enough.
Tyrion
sagged
back
to
the
ground
with
a
grunt.
“Don’t
help
me,
then.
I’ll
sit
right
here
until
you
leave.”

Jon
Snow
stroked
Ghost’s
thick
white
fur,
smiling
now.
“Ask
me
nicely.”

Tyrion
Lannister
felt
the
anger
coiling
inside
him,
and
crushed
it
out
with
a
will.
It
was
not
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
humiliated,
and
it
would
not
be
the
last.
Perhaps
he
even
deserved
this.
“I
should
be
very
grateful
for
your
kind
assistance,
Jon,”
he
said
mildly.

“Down,
Ghost,”
the
boy
said.
The
direwolf
sat
on
his
haunches.
Those
red
eyes
never
left
Tyrion.
Jon
came
around
behind
him,
slid
his
hands
under
his
arms,
and
lifted
him
easily
to
his
feet.
Then
he
picked
up
the
book
and
handed
it
back.

“Why
did
he
attack
me?”
Tyrion
asked
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
direwolf.
He
wiped
blood
and
dirt
from
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.

“Maybe
he
thought
you
were
a
grumkin.”

Tyrion
glanced
at
him
sharply.
Then
he
laughed,
a
raw
snort
of
amusement
that
came
bursting
out
through
his
nose
entirely
without
his
permission.
“Oh,
gods,”
he
said,
choking
on
his
laughter
and
shaking
his
head,
“I
suppose
I
do
rather
look
like
a
grumkin.
What
does
he
do
to
snarks?”

“You
don’t
want
to
know.”
Jon
picked
up
the
wineskin
and
handed
it
to
Tyrion.

Tyrion
pulled
out
the
stopper,
tilted
his
head,
and
squeezed
a
long
stream
into
his
mouth.
The
wine
was
cool
fire
as
it
trickled
down
his
throat
and
warmed
his
belly.
He
held
out
the
skin
to
Jon
Snow.
“Want
some?”

The
boy
took
the
skin
and
tried
a
cautious
swallow.
“It’s
true,
isn’t
it?”
he
said
when
he
was
done.
“What
you
said
about
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Tyrion
nodded.

Jon
Snow
set
his
mouth
in
a
grim
line.
“If
that’s
what
it
is,
that’s
what
it
is.”

Tyrion
grinned
at
him.
“That’s
good,
bastard.
Most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it.”

“Most
men,”
the
boy
said.
“But
not
you.”

“No,”
Tyrion
admitted,
“not
me.
I
seldom
even
dream
of
dragons
anymore.
There
are
no
dragons.”
He
scooped
up
the
fallen
bearskin.
“Come,
we
had
better
return
to
camp
before
your
uncle
calls
the
banners.”

The
walk
was
short,
but
the
ground
was
rough
underfoot
and
his
legs
were
cramping
badly
by
the
time
they
got
back.
Jon
Snow
offered
a
hand
to
help
him
over
a
thick
tangle
of
roots,
but
Tyrion
shook
him
off.
He
would
make
his
own
way,
as
he
had
all
his
life.
Still,
the
camp
was
a
welcome
sight.
The
shelters
had
been
thrown
up
against
the
tumbledown
wall
of
a
long-abandoned
holdfast,
a
shield
against
the
wind.
The
horses
had
been
fed
and
a
fire
had
been
laid.
Yoren
sat
on
a
stone,
skinning
a
squirrel.
The
savory
smell
of
stew
filled
Tyrion’s
nostrils.
He
dragged
himself
over
to
where
his
man
Morrec
was
tending
the
stewpot.
Wordlessly,
Morrec
handed
him
the
ladle.
Tyrion
tasted
and
handed
it
back.
“More
pepper,”
he
said.

Benjen
Stark
emerged
from
the
shelter
he
shared
with
his
nephew.
“There
you
are.
Jon,
damn
it,
don’t
go
off
like
that
by
yourself.
I
thought
the
Others
had
gotten
you.”

“It
was
the
grumkins,”
Tyrion
told
him,
laughing.
Jon
Snow
smiled.
Stark
shot
a
baffled
look
at
Yoren.
The
old
man
grunted,
shrugged,
and
went
back
to
his
bloody
work.

The
squirrel
gave
some
body
to
the
stew,
and
they
ate
it
with
black
bread
and
hard
cheese
that
night
around
their
fire.
Tyrion
shared
around
his
skin
of
wine
until
even
Yoren
grew
mellow.
One
by
one
the
company
drifted
off
to
their
shelters
and
to
sleep,
all
but
Jon
Snow,
who
had
drawn
the
night’s
first
watch.

Tyrion
was
the
last
to
retire,
as
always.
As
he
stepped
into
the
shelter
his
men
had
built
for
him,
he
paused
and
looked
back
at
Jon
Snow.
The
boy
stood
near
the
fire,
his
face
still
and
hard,
looking
deep
into
the
flames.

Tyrion
Lannister
smiled
sadly
and
went
to
bed.





CATELYN

Ned
and
the
girls
were
eight
days
gone
when
Maester
Luwin
came
to
her
one
night
in
Bran’s
sickroom,
carrying
a
reading
lamp
and
the
books
of
account.
“It
is
past
time
that
we
reviewed
the
figures,
my
lady,”
he
said.
“You’ll
want
to
know
how
much
this
royal
visit
cost
us.”

Catelyn
looked
at
Bran
in
his
sickbed
and
brushed
his
hair
back
off
his
forehead.
It
had
grown
very
long,
she
realized.
She
would
have
to
cut
it
soon.
“I
have
no
need
to
look
at
figures,
Maester
Luwin,”
she
told
him,
never
taking
her
eyes
from
Bran.
“I
know
what
the
visit
cost
us.
Take
the
books
away.”

“My
lady,
the
king’s
party
had
healthy
appetites.
We
must
replenish
our
stores
before—”

She
cut
him
off.
“I
said,
take
the
books
away.
The
steward
will
attend
to
our
needs.”

“We
have
no
steward,”
Maester
Luwin
reminded
her.
Like
a
little
grey
rat,
she
thought,
he
would
not
let
go.
“Poole
went
south
to
establish
Lord
Eddard’s
household
at
King’s
Landing.”

Catelyn
nodded
absently.
“Oh,
yes.
I
remember.”
Bran
looked
so
pale.
She
wondered
whether
they
might
move
his
bed
under
the
window,
so
he
could
get
the
morning
sun.

Maester
Luwin
set
the
lamp
in
a
niche
by
the
door
and
fiddled
with
its
wick.
“There
are
several
appointments
that
require
your
immediate
attention,
my
lady.
Besides
the
steward,
we
need
a
captain
of
the
guards
to
fill
Jory’s
place,
a
new
master
of
horse—”

Her
eyes
snapped
around
and
found
him.
“A
master
of
horse?”
Her
voice
was
a
whip.

The
maester
was
shaken.
“Yes,
my
lady.
Hullen
rode
south
with
Lord
Eddard,
so—”

“My
son
lies
here
broken
and
dying,
Luwin,
and
you
wish
to
discuss
a
new
master
of
horse?
Do
you
think
I
care
what
happens
in
the
stables?
Do
you
think
it
matters
to
me
one
whit?
I
would
gladly
butcher
every
horse
in
Winterfell
with
my
own
hands
if
it
would
open
Bran’s
eyes,
do
you
understand
that?
Do
you?”

He
bowed
his
head.
“Yes,
my
lady,
but
the
appointments—”

“I’ll
make
the
appointments,”
Robb
said.

Catelyn
had
not
heard
him
enter,
but
there
he
stood
in
the
doorway,
looking
at
her.
She
had
been
shouting,
she
realized
with
a
sudden
flush
of
shame.
What
was
happening
to
her?
She
was
so
tired,
and
her
head
hurt
all
the
time.

Maester
Luwin
looked
from
Catelyn
to
her
son.
“I
have
prepared
a
list
of
those
we
might
wish
to
consider
for
the
vacant
offices,”
he
said,
offering
Robb
a
paper
plucked
from
his
sleeve.

Her
son
glanced
at
the
names.
He
had
come
from
outside,
Catelyn
saw;
his
cheeks
were
red
from
the
cold,
his
hair
shaggy
and
windblown.
“Good
men,”
he
said.
“We’ll
talk
about
them
tomorrow.”
He
handed
back
the
list
of
names.

“Very
good,
my
lord.”
The
paper
vanished
into
his
sleeve.

“Leave
us
now,”
Robb
said.
Maester
Luwin
bowed
and
departed.
Robb
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
turned
to
her.
He
was
wearing
a
sword,
she
saw.
“Mother,
what
are
you
doing?”

Catelyn
had
always
thought
Robb
looked
like
her;
like
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Sansa,
he
had
the
Tully
coloring,
the
auburn
hair,
the
blue
eyes.
Yet
now
for
the
first
time
she
saw
something
of
Eddard
Stark
in
his
face,
something
as
stern
and
hard
as
the
north.
“What
am
I
doing?”
she
echoed,
puzzled.
“How
can
you
ask
that?
What
do
you
imagine
I’m
doing?
I
am
taking
care
of
your
brother.
I
am
taking
care
of
Bran.”

“Is
that
what
you
call
it?
You
haven’t
left
this
room
since
Bran
was
hurt.
You
didn’t
even
come
to
the
gate
when
Father
and
the
girls
went
south.”

“I
said
my
farewells
to
them
here,
and
watched
them
ride
out
from
that
window.”
She
had
begged
Ned
not
to
go,
not
now,
not
after
what
had
happened;
everything
had
changed
now,
couldn’t
he
see
that?
It
was
no
use.
He
had
no
choice,
he
had
told
her,
and
then
he
left,
choosing.
“I
can’t
leave
him,
even
for
a
moment,
not
when
any
moment
could
be
his
last.
I
have
to
be
with
him,
if…
if…”
She
took
her
son’s
limp
hand,
sliding
his
fingers
through
her
own.
He
was
so
frail
and
thin,
with
no
strength
left
in
his
hand,
but
she
could
still
feel
the
warmth
of
life
through
his
skin.

Robb’s
voice
softened.
“He’s
not
going
to
die,
Mother.
Maester
Luwin
says
the
time
of
greatest
danger
has
passed.”

“And
what
if
Maester
Luwin
is
wrong?
What
if
Bran
needs
me
and
I’m
not
here?”

“Rickon
needs
you,”
Robb
said
sharply.
“He’s
only
three,
he
doesn’t
understand
what’s
happening.
He
thinks
everyone
has
deserted
him,
so
he
follows
me
around
all
day,
clutching
my
leg
and
crying.
I
don’t
know
what
to
do
with
him.”
He
paused
a
moment,
chewing
on
his
lower
lip
the
way
he’d
done
when
he
was
little.
“Mother,
I
need
you
too.
I’m
trying
but
I
can’t…
I
can’t
do
it
all
by
myself.”
His
voice
broke
with
sudden
emotion,
and
Catelyn
remembered
that
he
was
only
fourteen.
She
wanted
to
get
up
and
go
to
him,
but
Bran
was
still
holding
her
hand
and
she
could
not
move.

Outside
the
tower,
a
wolf
began
to
howl.
Catelyn
trembled,
just
for
a
second.

“Bran’s.”
Robb
opened
the
window
and
let
the
night
air
into
the
stuffy
tower
room.
The
howling
grew
louder.
It
was
a
cold
and
lonely
sound,
full
of
melancholy
and
despair.

“Don’t,”
she
told
him.
“Bran
needs
to
stay
warm.”

“He
needs
to
hear
them
sing,”
Robb
said.
Somewhere
out
in
Winterfell,
a
second
wolf
began
to
howl
in
chorus
with
the
first.
Then
a
third,
closer.
“Shaggydog
and
Grey
Wind,”
Robb
said
as
their
voices
rose
and
fell
together.
“You
can
tell
them
apart
if
you
listen
close.”

Catelyn
was
shaking.
It
was
the
grief,
the
cold,
the
howling
of
the
direwolves.
Night
after
night,
the
howling
and
the
cold
wind
and
the
grey
empty
castle,
on
and
on
they
went,
never
changing,
and
her
boy
lying
there
broken,
the
sweetest
of
her
children,
the
gentlest,
Bran
who
loved
to
laugh
and
climb
and
dreamt
of
knighthood,
all
gone
now,
she
would
never
hear
him
laugh
again.
Sobbing,
she
pulled
her
hand
free
of
his
and
covered
her
ears
against
those
terrible
howls.
“Make
them
stop!”
she
cried.
“I
can’t
stand
it,
make
them
stop,
make
them
stop,
kill
them
all
if
you
must,
just
make
them
stop!”

She
didn’t
remember
falling
to
the
floor,
but
there
she
was,
and
Robb
was
lifting
her,
holding
her
in
strong
arms.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
Mother.
They
would
never
hurt
him.”
He
helped
her
to
her
narrow
bed
in
the
corner
of
the
sickroom.
“Close
your
eyes,”
he
said
gently.
“Rest.
Maester
Luwin
tells
me
you’ve
hardly
slept
since
Bran’s
fall.”

“I
can’t,”
she
wept.
“Gods
forgive
me,
Robb,
I
can’t,
what
if
he
dies
while
I’m
asleep,
what
if
he
dies,
what
if
he
dies…”
The
wolves
were
still
howling.
She
screamed
and
held
her
ears
again.
“Oh,
gods,
close
the
window!”

“If
you
swear
to
me
you’ll
sleep.”
Robb
went
to
the
window,
but
as
he
reached
for
the
shutters
another
sound
was
added
to
the
mournful
howling
of
the
direwolves.
“Dogs,”
he
said,
listening.
“All
the
dogs
are
barking.
They’ve
never
done
that
before…”
Catelyn
heard
his
breath
catch
in
his
throat.
When
she
looked
up,
his
face
was
pale
in
the
lamplight.
“Fire,”
he
whispered.

Fire,
she
thought,
and
then,
Bran!
“Help
me,”
she
said
urgently,
sitting
up.
“Help
me
with
Bran.”

Robb
did
not
seem
to
hear
her.
“The
library
tower’s
on
fire,”
he
said.

Catelyn
could
see
the
flickering
reddish
light
through
the
open
window
now.
She
sagged
with
relief.
Bran
was
safe.
The
library
was
across
the
bailey,
there
was
no
way
the
fire
would
reach
them
here.
“Thank
the
gods,”
she
whispered.

Robb
looked
at
her
as
if
she’d
gone
mad.
“Mother,
stay
here.
I’ll
come
back
as
soon
as
the
fire’s
out.”
He
ran
then.
She
heard
him
shout
to
the
guards
outside
the
room,
heard
them
descending
together
in
a
wild
rush,
taking
the
stairs
two
and
three
at
a
time.

Outside,
there
were
shouts
of
“Fire!”
in
the
yard,
screams,
running
footsteps,
the
whinny
of
frightened
horses,
and
the
frantic
barking
of
the
castle
dogs.
The
howling
was
gone,
she
realized
as
she
listened
to
the
cacophony.
The
direwolves
had
fallen
silent.

Catelyn
said
a
silent
prayer
of
thanks
to
the
seven
faces
of
god
as
she
went
to
the
window.
Across
the
bailey,
long
tongues
of
flame
shot
from
the
windows
of
the
library.
She
watched
the
smoke
rise
into
the
sky
and
thought
sadly
of
all
the
books
the
Starks
had
gathered
over
the
centuries.
Then
she
closed
the
shutters.

When
she
turned
away
from
the
window,
the
man
was
in
the
room
with
her.

“You
weren’t
s’posed
to
be
here,”
he
muttered
sourly.
“No
one
was
s’posed
to
be
here.”

He
was
a
small,
dirty
man
in
filthy
brown
clothing,
and
he
stank
of
horses.
Catelyn
knew
all
the
men
who
worked
in
their
stables,
and
he
was
none
of
them.
He
was
gaunt,
with
limp
blond
hair
and
pale
eyes
deep-sunk
in
a
bony
face,
and
there
was
a
dagger
in
his
hand.

Catelyn
looked
at
the
knife,
then
at
Bran.
“No,”
she
said.
The
word
stuck
in
her
throat,
the
merest
whisper.

He
must
have
heard
her.
“It’s
a
mercy,”
he
said.
“He’s
dead
already.”

“No,”
Catelyn
said,
louder
now
as
she
found
her
voice
again.
“No,
you
can’t.”
She
spun
back
toward
the
window
to
scream
for
help,
but
the
man
moved
faster
than
she
would
have
believed.
One
hand
clamped
down
over
her
mouth
and
yanked
back
her
head,
the
other
brought
the
dagger
up
to
her
windpipe.
The
stench
of
him
was
overwhelming.

She
reached
up
with
both
hands
and
grabbed
the
blade
with
all
her
strength,
pulling
it
away
from
her
throat.
She
heard
him
cursing
into
her
ear.
Her
fingers
were
slippery
with
blood,
but
she
would
not
let
go
of
the
dagger.
The
hand
over
her
mouth
clenched
more
tightly,
shutting
off
her
air.
Catelyn
twisted
her
head
to
the
side
and
managed
to
get
a
piece
of
his
flesh
between
her
teeth.
She
bit
down
hard
into
his
palm.
The
man
grunted
in
pain.
She
ground
her
teeth
together
and
tore
at
him,
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
let
go.
The
taste
of
his
blood
filled
her
mouth.
She
sucked
in
air
and
screamed,
and
he
grabbed
her
hair
and
pulled
her
away
from
him,
and
she
stumbled
and
went
down,
and
then
he
was
standing
over
her,
breathing
hard,
shaking.
The
dagger
was
still
clutched
tightly
in
his
right
hand,
slick
with
blood.
“You
weren’t
s’posed
to
be
here,”
he
repeated
stupidly.

Catelyn
saw
the
shadow
slip
through
the
open
door
behind
him.
There
was
a
low
rumble,
less
than
a
snarl,
the
merest
whisper
of
a
threat,
but
he
must
have
heard
something,
because
he
started
to
turn
just
as
the
wolf
made
its
leap.
They
went
down
together,
half
sprawled
over
Catelyn
where
she’d
fallen.
The
wolf
had
him
under
the
jaw.
The
man’s
shriek
lasted
less
than
a
second
before
the
beast
wrenched
back
its
head,
taking
out
half
his
throat.

His
blood
felt
like
warm
rain
as
it
sprayed
across
her
face.

The
wolf
was
looking
at
her.
Its
jaws
were
red
and
wet
and
its
eyes
glowed
golden
in
the
dark
room.
It
was
Bran’s
wolf,
she
realized.
Of
course
it
was.
“Thank
you,”
Catelyn
whispered,
her
voice
faint
and
tiny.
She
lifted
her
hand,
trembling.
The
wolf
padded
closer,
sniffed
at
her
fingers,
then
licked
at
the
blood
with
a
wet
rough
tongue.
When
it
had
cleaned
all
the
blood
off
her
hand,
it
turned
away
silently
and
jumped
up
on
Bran’s
bed
and
lay
down
beside
him.
Catelyn
began
to
laugh
hysterically.

That
was
the
way
they
found
them,
when
Robb
and
Maester
Luwin
and
Ser
Rodrik
burst
in
with
half
the
guards
in
Winterfell.
When
the
laughter
finally
died
in
her
throat,
they
wrapped
her
in
warm
blankets
and
led
her
back
to
the
Great
Keep,
to
her
own
chambers.
Old
Nan
undressed
her
and
helped
her
into
a
scalding
hot
bath
and
washed
the
blood
off
her
with
a
soft
cloth.

Afterward
Maester
Luwin
arrived
to
dress
her
wounds.
The
cuts
in
her
fingers
went
deep,
almost
to
the
bone,
and
her
scalp
was
raw
and
bleeding
where
he’d
pulled
out
a
handful
of
hair.
The
maester
told
her
the
pain
was
just
starting
now,
and
gave
her
milk
of
the
poppy
to
help
her
sleep.

Finally
she
closed
her
eyes.

When
she
opened
them
again,
they
told
her
that
she
had
slept
four
days.
Catelyn
nodded
and
sat
up
in
bed.
It
all
seemed
like
a
nightmare
to
her
now,
everything
since
Bran’s
fall,
a
terrible
dream
of
blood
and
grief,
but
she
had
the
pain
in
her
hands
to
remind
her
that
it
was
real.
She
felt
weak
and
light-headed,
yet
strangely
resolute,
as
if
a
great
weight
had
lifted
from
her.

“Bring
me
some
bread
and
honey,”
she
told
her
servants,
“and
take
word
to
Maester
Luwin
that
my
bandages
want
changing.”
They
looked
at
her
in
surprise
and
ran
to
do
her
bidding.

Catelyn
remembered
the
way
she
had
been
before,
and
she
was
ashamed.
She
had
let
them
all
down,
her
children,
her
husband,
her
House.
It
would
not
happen
again.
She
would
show
these
northerners
how
strong
a
Tully
of
Riverrun
could
be.

Robb
arrived
before
her
food.
Rodrik
Cassel
came
with
him,
and
her
husband’s
ward
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
lastly
Hallis
Mollen,
a
muscular
guardsman
with
a
square
brown
beard.
He
was
the
new
captain
of
the
guard,
Robb
said.
Her
son
was
dressed
in
boiled
leather
and
ringmail,
she
saw,
and
a
sword
hung
at
his
waist.

“Who
was
he?”
Catelyn
asked
them.

“No
one
knows
his
name,”
Hallis
Mollen
told
her.
“He
was
no
man
of
Winterfell,
m’lady,
but
some
says
they
seen
him
here
and
about
the
castle
these
past
few
weeks.”

“One
of
the
king’s
men,
then,”
she
said,
“or
one
of
the
Lannisters’.
He
could
have
waited
behind
when
the
others
left.”

“Maybe,”
Hal
said.
“With
all
these
strangers
filling
up
Winterfell
of
late,
there’s
no
way
of
saying
who
he
belonged
to.”

“He’d
been
hiding
in
your
stables,”
Greyjoy
said.
“You
could
smell
it
on
him.”

“And
how
could
he
go
unnoticed?”
she
said
sharply.

Hallis
Mollen
looked
abashed.
“Between
the
horses
Lord
Eddard
took
south
and
them
we
sent
north
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
the
stalls
were
half-empty.
It
were
no
great
trick
to
hide
from
the
stableboys.
Could
be
Hodor
saw
him,
the
talk
is
that
boy’s
been
acting
queer,
but
simple
as
he
is…”
Hal
shook
his
head.

“We
found
where
he’d
been
sleeping,”
Robb
put
in.
“He
had
ninety
silver
stags
in
a
leather
bag
buried
beneath
the
straw.”

“It’s
good
to
know
my
son’s
life
was
not
sold
cheaply,”
Catelyn
said
bitterly.

Hallis
Mollen
looked
at
her,
confused.
“Begging
your
grace,
m’lady,
you
saying
he
was
out
to
kill
your
boy?”

Greyjoy
was
doubtful.
“That’s
madness.”

“He
came
for
Bran,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
kept
muttering
how
I
wasn’t
supposed
to
be
there.
He
set
the
library
fire
thinking
I
would
rush
to
put
it
out,
taking
any
guards
with
me.
If
I
hadn’t
been
half-mad
with
grief,
it
would
have
worked.”

“Why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
Bran?”
Robb
said.
“Gods,
he’s
only
a
little
boy,
helpless,
sleeping…”

Catelyn
gave
her
firstborn
a
challenging
look.
“If
you
are
to
rule
in
the
north,
you
must
think
these
things
through,
Robb.
Answer
your
own
question.
Why
would
anyone
want
to
kill
a
sleeping
child?”

Before
he
could
answer,
the
servants
returned
with
a
plate
of
food
fresh
from
the
kitchen.
There
was
much
more
than
she’d
asked
for:
hot
bread,
butter
and
honey
and
blackberry
preserves,
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
a
soft-boiled
egg,
a
wedge
of
cheese,
a
pot
of
mint
tea.
And
with
it
came
Maester
Luwin.

“How
is
my
son,
Maester?”
Catelyn
looked
at
all
the
food
and
found
she
had
no
appetite.

Maester
Luwin
lowered
his
eyes.
“Unchanged,
my
lady.”

It
was
the
reply
she
had
expected,
no
more
and
no
less.
Her
hands
throbbed
with
pain,
as
if
the
blade
were
still
in
her,
cutting
deep.
She
sent
the
servants
away
and
looked
back
to
Robb.
“Do
you
have
the
answer
yet?”

“Someone
is
afraid
Bran
might
wake
up,”
Robb
said,
“afraid
of
what
he
might
say
or
do,
afraid
of
something
he
knows.”

Catelyn
was
proud
of
him.
“Very
good.”
She
turned
to
the
new
captain
of
the
guard.
“We
must
keep
Bran
safe.
If
there
was
one
killer,
there
could
be
others.”

“How
many
guards
do
you
want,
rn’lady?”
Hal
asked.

“So
long
as
Lord
Eddard
is
away,
my
son
is
the
master
of
Winterfell,”
she
told
him.

Robb
stood
a
little
taller.
“Put
one
man
in
the
sickroom,
night
and
day,
one
outside
the
door,
two
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs.
No
one
sees
Bran
without
my
warrant
or
my
mother’s.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord.”

“Do
it
now,”
Catelyn
suggested.

“And
let
his
wolf
stay
in
the
room
with
him,”
Robb
added.

“Yes,”
Catelyn
said.
And
then
again:
“Yes.”

Hallis
Mollen
bowed
and
left
the
room.

“Lady
Stark,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
when
the
guardsman
had
gone,
“did
you
chance
to
notice
the
dagger
the
killer
used?”

“The
circumstances
did
not
allow
me
to
examine
it
closely,
but
I
can
vouch
for
its
edge,”
Catelyn
replied
with
a
dry
smile.
“Why
do
you
ask?”

“We
found
the
knife
still
in
the
villain’s
grasp.
It
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
altogether
too
fine
a
weapon
for
such
a
man,
so
I
looked
at
it
long
and
hard.
The
blade
is
Valyrian
steel,
the
hilt
dragonbone.
A
weapon
like
that
has
no
business
being
in
the
hands
of
such
as
him.
Someone
gave
it
to
him.”

Catelyn
nodded,
thoughtful.
“Robb,
close
the
door.”

He
looked
at
her
strangely,
but
did
as
she
told
him.

“What
I
am
about
to
tell
you
must
not
leave
this
room,”
she
told
them.
“I
want
your
oaths
on
that.
If
even
part
of
what
I
suspect
is
true,
Ned
and
my
girls
have
ridden
into
deadly
danger,
and
a
word
in
the
wrong
ears
could
mean
their
lives.”

“Lord
Eddard
is
a
second
father
to
me,”
said
Theon
Greyjoy.
“I
do
so
swear.”

“You
have
my
oath,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

“And
mine,
my
lady,”
echoed
Ser
Rodrik.

She
looked
at
her
son.
“And
you,
Robb?”

He
nodded
his
consent.

“My
sister
Lysa
believes
the
Lannisters
murdered
her
husband,
Lord
Arryn,
the
Hand
of
the
King,”
Catelyn
told
them.
“It
comes
to
me
that
Jaime
Lannister
did
not
join
the
hunt
the
day
Bran
fell.
He
remained
here
in
the
castle.”
The
room
was
deathly
quiet.
“I
do
not
think
Bran
fell
from
that
tower,”
she
said
into
the
stillness.
“I
think
he
was
thrown.”

The
shock
was
plain
on
their
faces.
“My
lady,
that
is
a
monstrous
suggestion,”
said
Rodrik
Cassel.
“Even
the
Kingslayer
would
flinch
at
the
murder
of
an
innocent
child.”

“Oh,
would
he?”
Theon
Greyjoy
asked.
“I
wonder.”

“There
is
no
limit
to
Lannister
pride
or
Lannister
ambition,”
Catelyn
said.

“The
boy
had
always
been
surehanded
in
the
past,”
Maester
Luwin
said
thoughtfully.
“He
knew
every
stone
in
Winterfell.”

“Gods,”
Robb
swore,
his
young
face
dark
with
anger.
“If
this
is
true,
he
will
pay
for
it.”
He
drew
his
sword
and
waved
it
in
the
air.
“I’ll
kill
him
myself!”

Ser
Rodrik
bristled
at
him.
“Put
that
away!
The
Lannisters
are
a
hundred
leagues
away.
Never
draw
your
sword
unless
you
mean
to
use
it.
How
many
times
must
I
tell
you,
foolish
boy?”

Abashed,
Robb
sheathed
his
sword,
suddenly
a
child
again.
Catelyn
said
to
Ser
Rodrik,
“I
see
my
son
is
wearing
steel
now.”

The
old
master-at-arms
said,
“I
thought
it
was
time.”

Robb
was
looking
at
her
anxiously.
“Past
time,”
she
said.
“Winterfell
may
have
need
of
all
its
swords
soon,
and
they
had
best
not
be
made
of
wood.”

Theon
Greyjoy
put
a
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
blade
and
said,
“My
lady,
if
it
comes
to
that,
my
House
owes
yours
a
great
debt.”

Maester
Luwin
pulled
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
chafed
against
his
neck.
“All
we
have
is
conjecture.
This
is
the
queen’s
beloved
brother
we
mean
to
accuse.
She
will
not
take
it
kindly.
We
must
have
proof,
or
forever
keep
silent.”

“Your
proof
is
in
the
dagger,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“A
fine
blade
like
that
will
not
have
gone
unnoticed.”

There
was
only
one
place
to
find
the
truth
of
it,
Catelyn
realized.
“Someone
must
go
to
King’s
Landing.”

“I’ll
go,”
Robb
said.

“No,”
she
told
him.
“Your
place
is
here.
There
must
always
be
a
Stark
in
Winterfell.”
She
looked
at
Ser
Rodrik
with
his
great
white
whiskers,
at
Maester
Luwin
in
his
grey
robes,
at
young
Greyjoy,
lean
and
dark
and
impetuous.
Who
to
send?
Who
would
be
believed?
Then
she
knew.
Catelyn
struggled
to
push
back
the
blankets,
her
bandaged
fingers
as
stiff
and
unyielding
as
stone.
She
climbed
out
of
bed.
“I
must
go
myself.”

“My
lady,”
said
Maester
Luwin,
“is
that
wise?
Surely
the
Lannisters
would
greet
your
arrival
with
suspicion.”

“What
about
Bran?”
Robb
asked.
The
poor
boy
looked
utterly
confused
now.
“You
can’t
mean
to
leave
him.”

“I
have
done
everything
I
can
for
Bran,”
she
said,
laying
a
wounded
hand
on
his
arm.
“His
life
is
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
and
Maester
Luwin.
As
you
reminded
me
yourself,
Robb,
I
have
other
children
to
think
of
now.”

“You
will
need
a
strong
escort,
my
lady,”
Theon
said.

“I’ll
send
Hal
with
a
squad
of
guardsmen,”
Robb
said.

“No,”
Catelyn
said.
“A
large
party
attracts
unwelcome
attention.
I
would
not
have
the
Lannisters
know
I
am
coming.”

Ser
Rodrik
protested.
“My
lady,
let
me
accompany
you
at
least.
The
kingsroad
can
be
perilous
for
a
woman
alone.”

“I
will
not
be
taking
the
kingsroad,”
Catelyn
replied.
She
thought
for
a
moment,
then
nodded
her
consent.
“Two
riders
can
move
as
fast
as
one,
and
a
good
deal
faster
than
a
long
column
burdened
by
wagons
and
wheelhouses.
I
will
welcome
your
company,
Ser
Rodrik.
We
will
follow
the
White
Knife
down
to
the
sea,
and
hire
a
ship
at
White
Harbor.
Strong
horses
and
brisk
winds
should
bring
us
to
King’s
Landing
well
ahead
of
Ned
and
the
Lannisters.”
And
then,
she
thought,
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see.





SANSA

Eddard
Stark
had
left
before
dawn,
Septa
Mordane
informed
Sansa
as
they
broke
their
fast.
“The
king
sent
for
him.
Another
hunt,
I
do
believe.
There
are
still
wild
aurochs
in
these
lands,
I
am
told.”

“I’ve
never
seen
an
aurochs,”
Sansa
said,
feeding
a
piece
of
bacon
to
Lady
under
the
table.
The
direwolf
took
it
from
her
hand,
as
delicate
as
a
queen.

Septa
Mordane
sniffed
in
disapproval.
“A
noble
lady
does
not
feed
dogs
at
her
table,”
she
said,
breaking
off
another
piece
of
comb
and
letting
the
honey
drip
down
onto
her
bread.

“She’s
not
a
dog,
she’s
a
direwolf,”
Sansa
pointed
out
as
Lady
licked
her
fingers
with
a
rough
tongue.
“Anyway,
Father
said
we
could
keep
them
with
us
if
we
want.”

The
septa
was
not
appeased.
“You’re
a
good
girl,
Sansa,
but
I
do
vow,
when
it
comes
to
that
creature
you’re
as
willful
as
your
sister
Arya.”
She
scowled.
“And
where
is
Arya
this
morning?”

“She
wasn’t
hungry,”
Sansa
said,
knowing
full
well
that
her
sister
had
probably
stolen
down
to
the
kitchen
hours
ago
and
wheedled
a
breakfast
out
of
some
cook’s
boy.

“Do
remind
her
to
dress
nicely
today.
The
grey
velvet,
perhaps.
We
are
all
invited
to
ride
with
the
queen
and
Princess
Myrcella
in
the
royal
wheelhouse,
and
we
must
look
our
best.”

Sansa
already
looked
her
best.
She
had
brushed
out
her
long
auburn
hair
until
it
shone,
and
picked
her
nicest
blue
silks.
She
had
been
looking
forward
to
today
for
more
than
a
week.
It
was
a
great
honor
to
ride
with
the
queen,
and
besides,
Prince
Joffrey
might
be
there.
Her
betrothed.
Just
thinking
it
made
her
feel
a
strange
fluttering
inside,
even
though
they
were
not
to
marry
for
years
and
years.
Sansa
did
not
really
know
Joffrey
yet,
but
she
was
already
in
love
with
him.
He
was
all
she
ever
dreamt
her
prince
should
be,
tall
and
handsome
and
strong,
with
hair
like
gold.
She
treasured
every
chance
to
spend
time
with
him,
few
as
they
were.
The
only
thing
that
scared
her
about
today
was
Arya.
Arya
had
a
way
of
ruining
everything.
You
never
knew
what
she
would
do.
“I’ll
tell
her,”
Sansa
said
uncertainly,
“but
she’ll
dress
the
way
she
always
does.”
She
hoped
it
wouldn’t
be
too
embarrassing.
“May
I
be
excused?”

“You
may.”
Septa
Mordane
helped
herself
to
more
bread
and
honey,
and
Sansa
slid
from
the
bench.
Lady
followed
at
her
heels
as
she
ran
from
the
inn’s
common
room.

Outside,
she
stood
for
a
moment
amidst
the
shouts
and
curses
and
the
creak
of
wooden
wheels
as
the
men
broke
down
the
tents
and
pavilions
and
loaded
the
wagons
for
another
day’s
march.
The
inn
was
a
sprawling
three-story
structure
of
pale
stone,
the
biggest
that
Sansa
had
ever
seen,
but
even
so,
it
had
accommodations
for
less
than
a
third
of
the
king’s
party,
which
had
swollen
to
more
than
four
hundred
with
the
addition
of
her
father’s
household
and
the
freeriders
who
had
joined
them
on
the
road.

She
found
Arya
on
the
banks
of
the
Trident,
trying
to
hold
Nymeria
still
while
she
brushed
dried
mud
from
her
fur.
The
direwolf
was
not
enjoying
the
process.
Arya
was
wearing
the
same
riding
leathers
she
had
worn
yesterday
and
the
day
before.

“You
better
put
on
something
pretty,”
Sansa
told
her.
“Septa
Mordane
said
so.
We’re
traveling
in
the
queen’s
wheelhouse
with
Princess
Myrcella
today.”

“I’m
not,”
Arya
said,
trying
to
brush
a
tangle
out
of
Nymeria’s
matted
grey
fur.
“Mycah
and
I
are
going
to
ride
upstream
and
look
for
rubies
at
the
ford.”

“Rubies,”
Sansa
said,
lost.
“What
rubies?”

Arya
gave
her
a
look
like
she
was
so
stupid.
“Rhaegar’s
rubies.
This
is
where
King
Robert
killed
him
and
won
the
crown.”

Sansa
regarded
her
scrawny
little
sister
in
disbelief.
“You
can’t
look
for
rubies,
the
princess
is
expecting
us.
The
queen
invited
us
both.”

“I
don’t
care,”
Arya
said.
“The
wheelhouse
doesn’t
even
have
windows,
you
can’t
see
a
thing.”

“What
could
you
want
to
see?”
Sansa
said,
annoyed.
She
had
been
thrilled
by
the
invitation,
and
her
stupid
sister
was
going
to
ruin
everything,
just
as
she’d
feared.
“It’s
all
just
fields
and
farms
and
holdfasts.”

“It
is
not,”
Arya
said
stubbornly.
“If
you
came
with
us
sometimes,
you’d
see.”

“I
hate
riding,”
Sansa
said
fervently.
“All
it
does
is
get
you
soiled
and
dusty
and
sore.”

Arya
shrugged.
“Hold
still,”
she
snapped
at
Nymeria,
“I’m
not
hurting
you.”
Then
to
Sansa
she
said,
“When
we
were
crossing
the
Neck,
I
counted
thirty-six
flowers
I
never
saw
before,
and
Mycah
showed
me
a
lizard-lion.”

Sansa
shuddered.
They
had
been
twelve
days
crossing
the
Neck,
rumbling
down
a
crooked
causeway
through
an
endless
black
bog,
and
she
had
hated
every
moment
of
it.
The
air
had
been
damp
and
clammy,
the
causeway
so
narrow
they
could
not
even
make
proper
camp
at
night,
they
had
to
stop
right
on
the
kingsroad.
Dense
thickets
of
half-drowned
trees
pressed
close
around
them,
branches
dripping
with
curtains
of
pale
fungus.
Huge
flowers
bloomed
in
the
mud
and
floated
on
pools
of
stagnant
water,
but
if
you
were
stupid
enough
to
leave
the
causeway
to
pluck
them,
there
were
quicksands
waiting
to
suck
you
down,
and
snakes
watching
from
the
trees,
and
lizard-lions
floating
half-submerged
in
the
water,
like
black
logs
with
eyes
and
teeth.

None
of
which
stopped
Arya,
of
course.
One
day
she
came
back
grinning
her
horsey
grin,
her
hair
all
tangled
and
her
clothes
covered
in
mud,
clutching
a
raggedy
bunch
of
purple
and
green
flowers
for
Father.
Sansa
kept
hoping
he
would
tell
Arya
to
behave
herself
and
act
like
the
highborn
lady
she
was
supposed
to
be,
but
he
never
did,
he
only
hugged
her
and
thanked
her
for
the
flowers.
That
just
made
her
worse.

Then
it
turned
out
the
purple
flowers
were
called
poison
kisses,
and
Arya
got
a
rash
on
her
arms.
Sansa
would
have
thought
that
might
have
taught
her
a
lesson,
but
Arya
laughed
about
it,
and
the
next
day
she
rubbed
mud
all
over
her
arms
like
some
ignorant
bog
woman
just
because
her
friend
Mycah
told
her
it
would
stop
the
itching.
She
had
bruises
on
her
arms
and
shoulders
too,
dark
purple
welts
and
faded
green-and-yellow
splotches,
Sansa
had
seen
them
when
her
sister
undressed
for
sleep.
How
she
had
gotten
those
only
the
seven
gods
knew.

Arya
was
still
going
on,
brushing
out
Nymeria’s
tangles
and
chattering
about
things
she’d
seen
on
the
trek
south.
“Last
week
we
found
this
haunted
watchtower,
and
the
day
before
we
chased
a
herd
of
wild
horses.
You
should
have
seen
them
run
when
they
caught
a
scent
of
Nymeria.”
The
wolf
wriggled
in
her
grasp
and
Arya
scolded
her.
“Stop
that,
I
have
to
do
the
other
side,
you’re
all
muddy.”

“You’re
not
supposed
to
leave
the
column,”
Sansa
reminded
her.
“Father
said
so.”

Arya
shrugged.
“I
didn’t
go
far.
Anyway,
Nymeria
was
with
me
the
whole
time.
I
don’t
always
go
off,
either.
Sometimes
it’s
fun
just
to
ride
along
with
the
wagons
and
talk
to
people.”

Sansa
knew
all
about
the
sorts
of
people
Arya
liked
to
talk
to:
squires
and
grooms
and
serving
girls,
old
men
and
naked
children,
rough-spoken
freeriders
of
uncertain
birth.
Arya
would
make
friends
with
anybody.
This
Mycah
was
the
worst;
a
butcher’s
boy,
thirteen
and
wild,
he
slept
in
the
meat
wagon
and
smelled
of
the
slaughtering
block.
Just
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
to
make
Sansa
feel
sick,
but
Arya
seemed
to
prefer
his
company
to
hers.

Sansa
was
running
out
of
patience
now.
“You
have
to
come
with
me,”
she
told
her
sister
firmly.
“You
can’t
refuse
the
queen.
Septa
Mordane
will
expect
you.”

Arya
ignored
her.
She
gave
a
hard
yank
with
the
brush.
Nymeria
growled
and
spun
away,
affronted.
“Come
back
here!”

“There’s
going
to
be
lemon
cakes
and
tea,”
Sansa
went
on,
all
adult
and
reasonable.
Lady
brushed
against
her
leg.
Sansa
scratched
her
ears
the
way
she
liked,
and
Lady
sat
beside
her
on
her
haunches,
watching
Arya
chase
Nymeria.
“Why
would
you
want
to
ride
a
smelly
old
horse
and
get
all
sore
and
sweaty
when
you
could
recline
on
feather
pillows
and
eat
cakes
with
the
queen?”

“I
don’t
like
the
queen,”
Arya
said
casually.
Sansa
sucked
in
her
breath,
shocked
that
even
Arya
would
say
such
a
thing,
but
her
sister
prattled
on,
heedless.
“She
won’t
even
let
me
bring
Nymeria.”
She
thrust
the
brush
under
her
belt
and
stalked
her
wolf.
Nymeria
watched
her
approach
warily.

“A
royal
wheelhouse
is
no
place
for
a
wolf,”
Sansa
said.
“And
Princess
Myrcella
is
afraid
of
them,
you
know
that.”

“Myrcella
is
a
little
baby.”
Arya
grabbed
Nymeria
around
her
neck,
but
the
moment
she
pulled
out
the
brush
again
the
direwolf
wriggled
free
and
bounded
off.
Frustrated,
Arya
threw
down
the
brush.
“Bad
wolf!”
she
shouted.

Sansa
couldn’t
help
but
smile
a
little.
The
kennelmaster
once
told
her
that
an
animal
takes
after
its
master.
She
gave
Lady
a
quick
little
hug.
Lady
licked
her
cheek.
Sansa
giggled.
Arya
heard
and
whirled
around,
glaring.
“I
don’t
care
what
you
say,
I’m
going
out
riding.”
Her
long
horsey
face
got
the
stubborn
look
that
meant
she
was
going
to
do
something
willful.

“Gods
be
true,
Arya,
sometimes
you
act
like
such
a
child,”
Sansa
said.
“I’ll
go
by
myself
then.
It
will
be
ever
so
much
nicer
that
way.
Lady
and
I
will
eat
all
the
lemon
cakes
and
just
have
the
best
time
without
you.”

She
turned
to
walk
off,
but
Arya
shouted
after
her,
“They
won’t
let
you
bring
Lady
either.”
She
was
gone
before
Sansa
could
think
of
a
reply,
chasing
Nymeria
along
the
river.

Alone
and
humiliated,
Sansa
took
the
long
way
back
to
the
inn,
where
she
knew
Septa
Mordane
would
be
waiting.
Lady
padded
quietly
by
her
side.
She
was
almost
in
tears.
All
she
wanted
was
for
things
to
be
nice
and
pretty,
the
way
they
were
in
the
songs.
Why
couldn’t
Arya
be
sweet
and
delicate
and
kind,
like
Princess
Myrcella?
She
would
have
liked
a
sister
like
that.

Sansa
could
never
understand
how
two
sisters,
born
only
two
years
apart,
could
be
so
different.
It
would
have
been
easier
if
Arya
had
been
a
bastard,
like
their
half
brother
Jon.
She
even
looked
like
Jon,
with
the
long
face
and
brown
hair
of
the
Starks,
and
nothing
of
their
lady
mother
in
her
face
or
her
coloring.
And
Jon’s
mother
had
been
common,
or
so
people
whispered.
Once,
when
she
was
littler,
Sansa
had
even
asked
Mother
if
perhaps
there
hadn’t
been
some
mistake.
Perhaps
the
grumkins
had
stolen
her
real
sister.
But
Mother
had
only
laughed
and
said
no,
Arya
was
her
daughter
and
Sansa’s
trueborn
sister,
blood
of
their
blood.
Sansa
could
not
think
why
Mother
would
want
to
lie
about
it,
so
she
supposed
it
had
to
be
true.

As
she
neared
the
center
of
camp,
her
distress
was
quickly
forgotten.
A
crowd
had
gathered
around
the
queen’s
wheelhouse.
Sansa
heard
excited
voices
buzzing
like
a
hive
of
bees.
The
doors
had
been
thrown
open,
she
saw,
and
the
queen
stood
at
the
top
of
the
wooden
steps,
smiling
down
at
someone.
She
heard
her
saying,
“The
council
does
us
great
honor,
my
good
lords.”

“What’s
happening?”
she
asked
a
squire
she
knew.

“The
council
sent
riders
from
King’s
Landing
to
escort
us
the
rest
of
the
way,”
he
told
her.
“An
honor
guard
for
the
king.”

Anxious
to
see,
Sansa
let
Lady
clear
a
path
through
the
crowd.
People
moved
aside
hastily
for
the
direwolf.
When
she
got
closer,
she
saw
two
knights
kneeling
before
the
queen,
in
armor
so
fine
and
gorgeous
that
it
made
her
blink.

One
knight
wore
an
intricate
suit
of
white
enameled
scales,
brilliant
as
a
field
of
new-fallen
snow,
with
silver
chasings
and
clasps
that
glittered
in
the
sun.
When
he
removed
his
helm,
Sansa
saw
that
he
was
an
old
man
with
hair
as
pale
as
his
armor,
yet
he
seemed
strong
and
graceful
for
all
that.
From
his
shoulders
hung
the
pure
white
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard.

His
companion
was
a
man
near
twenty
whose
armor
was
steel
plate
of
a
deep
forest-green.
He
was
the
handsomest
man
Sansa
had
ever
set
eyes
upon;
tall
and
powerfully
made,
with
jet-black
hair
that
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
framed
a
clean-shaven
face,
and
laughing
green
eyes
to
match
his
armor.
Cradled
under
one
arm
was
an
antlered
helm,
its
magnificent
rack
shimmering
in
gold.

At
first
Sansa
did
not
notice
the
third
stranger.
He
did
not
kneel
with
the
others.
He
stood
to
one
side,
beside
their
horses,
a
gaunt
grim
man
who
watched
the
proceedings
in
silence.
His
face
was
pockmarked
and
beardless,
with
deepset
eyes
and
hollow
cheeks.
Though
he
was
not
an
old
man,
only
a
few
wisps
of
hair
remained
to
him,
sprouting
above
his
ears,
but
those
he
had
grown
long
as
a
woman’s.
His
armor
was
iron-grey
chainmail
over
layers
of
boiled
leather,
plain
and
unadorned,
and
it
spoke
of
age
and
hard
use.
Above
his
right
shoulder
the
stained
leather
hilt
of
the
blade
strapped
to
his
back
was
visible;
a
two-handed
greatsword,
too
long
to
be
worn
at
his
side.

“The
king
is
gone
hunting,
but
I
know
he
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
when
he
returns,”
the
queen
was
saying
to
the
two
knights
who
knelt
before
her,
but
Sansa
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
the
third
man.
He
seemed
to
feel
the
weight
of
her
gaze.
Slowly
he
turned
his
head.
Lady
growled.
A
terror
as
overwhelming
as
anything
Sansa
Stark
had
ever
felt
filled
her
suddenly.
She
stepped
backward
and
bumped
into
someone.

Strong
hands
grasped
her
by
the
shoulders,
and
for
a
moment
Sansa
thought
it
was
her
father,
but
when
she
turned,
it
was
the
burned
face
of
Sandor
Clegane
looking
down
at
her,
his
mouth
twisted
in
a
terrible
mockery
of
a
smile.
“You
are
shaking,
girl,”
he
said,
his
voice
rasping.
“Do
I
frighten
you
so
much?”

He
did,
and
had
since
she
had
first
laid
eyes
on
the
ruin
that
fire
had
made
of
his
face,
though
it
seemed
to
her
now
that
he
was
not
half
so
terrifying
as
the
other.
Still,
Sansa
wrenched
away
from
him,
and
the
Hound
laughed,
and
Lady
moved
between
them,
rumbling
a
warning.
Sansa
dropped
to
her
knees
to
wrap
her
arms
around
the
wolf.
They
were
all
gathered
around
gaping,
she
could
feel
their
eyes
on
her,
and
here
and
there
she
heard
muttered
comments
and
titters
of
laughter.

“A
wolf,”
a
man
said,
and
someone
else
said,
“Seven
hells,
that’s
a
direwolf,”
and
the
first
man
said,
“What’s
it
doing
in
camp?”
and
the
Hound’s
rasping
voice
replied,
“The
Starks
use
them
for
wet
nurses,”
and
Sansa
realized
that
the
two
stranger
knights
were
looking
down
on
her
and
Lady,
swords
in
their
hands,
and
then
she
was
frightened
again,
and
ashamed.
Tears
filled
her
eyes.

She
heard
the
queen
say,
“Joffrey,
go
to
her.”

And
her
prince
was
there.

“Leave
her
alone,”
Joffrey
said.
He
stood
over
her,
beautiful
in
blue
wool
and
black
leather,
his
golden
curls
shining
in
the
sun
like
a
crown.
He
gave
her
his
hand,
drew
her
to
her
feet.
“What
is
it,
sweet
lady?
Why
are
you
afraid?
No
one
will
hurt
you.
Put
away
your
swords,
all
of
you.
The
wolf
is
her
little
pet,
that’s
all.”
He
looked
at
Sandor
Clegane.
“And
you,
dog,
away
with
you,
you’re
scaring
my
betrothed.”

The
Hound,
ever
faithful,
bowed
and
slid
away
quietly
through
the
press.
Sansa
struggled
to
steady
herself.
She
felt
like
such
a
fool.
She
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
a
noble
lady,
and
someday
she
would
be
a
queen.
“It
was
not
him,
my
sweet
prince,”
she
tried
to
explain.
“It
was
the
other
one.”

The
two
stranger
knights
exchanged
a
look.
“Payne?”
chuckled
the
young
man
in
the
green
armor.

The
older
man
in
white
spoke
to
Sansa
gently.
“Ofttimes
Ser
Ilyn
frightens
me
as
well,
sweet
lady.
He
has
a
fearsome
aspect.”

“As
well
he
should.”
The
queen
had
descended
from
the
wheelhouse.
The
spectators
parted
to
make
way
for
her.
“If
the
wicked
do
not
fear
the
Mng’s
Justice,
you
have
put
the
wrong
man
in
the
office.”

Sansa
finally
found
her
words.
“Then
surely
you
have
chosen
the
right
one,
Your
Grace,”
she
said,
and
a
gale
of
laughter
erupted
all
around
her.

“Well
spoken,
child,”
said
the
old
man
in
white.
“As
befits
the
daughter
of
Eddard
Stark.
I
am
honored
to
know
you,
however
irregular
the
manner
of
our
meeting.
I
am
Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
of
the
Kingsguard.”
He
bowed.

Sansa
knew
the
name,
and
now
the
courtesies
that
Septa
Mordane
had
taught
her
over
the
years
came
back
to
her.
“The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard,”
she
said,
“and
councillor
to
Robert
our
king
and
to
Aerys
Targaryen
before
him.
The
honor
is
mine,
good
knight.
Even
in
the
far
north,
the
singers
praise
the
deeds
of
Barristan
the
Bold.”

The
green
knight
laughed
again.
“Barristan
the
Old,
you
mean.
Don’t
flatter
him
too
sweetly,
child,
he
thinks
overmuch
of
himself
already.”
He
smiled
at
her.
“Now,
wolf
girl,
if
you
can
put
a
name
to
me
as
well,
then
I
must
concede
that
you
are
truly
our
Hand’s
daughter.”

Joffrey
stiffened
beside
her.
“Have
a
care
how
you
address
my
betrothed.”

“I
can
answer,”
Sansa
said
quickly,
to
quell
her
prince’s
anger.
She
smiled
at
the
green
knight.
“Your
helmet
bears
golden
antlers,
my
lord.
The
stag
is
the
sigil
of
the
royal
House.
King
Robert
has
two
brothers.
By
your
extreme
youth,
you
can
only
be
Renly
Baratheon,
Lord
of
Storm’s
End
and
councillor
to
the
king,
and
so
I
name
you.”

Ser
Barristan
chuckled.
“By
his
extreme
youth,
he
can
only
be
a
prancing
jackanapes,
and
so
I
name
him.”

There
was
general
laughter,
led
by
Lord
Renly
himself.
The
tension
of
a
few
moments
ago
was
gone,
and
Sansa
was
beginning
to
feel
comfortable…
until
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
shouldered
two
men
aside,
and
stood
before
her,
unsmiling.
He
did
not
say
a
word.
Lady
bared
her
teeth
and
began
to
growl,
a
low
rumble
full
of
menace,
but
this
time
Sansa
silenced
the
wolf
with
a
gentle
hand
to
the
head.
“I
am
sorry
if
I
offended
you,
Ser
Ilyn,”
she
said.

She
waited
for
an
answer,
but
none
came.
As
the
headsman
looked
at
her,
his
pale
colorless
eyes
seemed
to
strip
the
clothes
away
from
her,
and
then
the
skin,
leaving
her
soul
naked
before
him.
Still
silent,
he
turned
and
walked
away.

Sansa
did
not
understand.
She
looked
at
her
prince.
“Did
I
say
something
wrong,
Your
Grace?
Why
will
he
not
speak
to
me?”

“Ser
Ilyn
has
not
been
feeling
talkative
these
past
fourteen
years,”
Lord
Renly
commented
with
a
sly
smile.

Joffrey
gave
his
uncle
a
look
of
pure
loathing,
then
took
Sansa’s
hands
in
his
own.
“Aerys
Targaryen
had
his
tongue
ripped
out
with
hot
pincers.”

“He
speaks
most
eloquently
with
his
sword,
however,”
the
queen
said,
“and
his
devotion
to
our
realm
is
unquestioned.”
Then
she
smiled
graciously
and
said,
“Sansa,
the
good
councillors
and
I
must
speak
together
until
the
king
returns
with
your
father.
I
fear
we
shall
have
to
postpone
your
day
with
Myrcella.
Please
give
your
sweet
sister
my
apologies.
Joffrey,
perhaps
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
entertain
our
guest
today.”

“It
would
be
my
pleasure,
Mother,”
Joffrey
said
very
formally.
He
took
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
away
from
the
wheelhouse,
and
Sansa’s
spirits
took
flight.
A
whole
day
with
her
prince!
She
gazed
at
Joffrey
worshipfully.
He
was
so
gallant,
she
thought.
The
way
he
had
rescued
her
from
Ser
Ilyn
and
the
Hound,
why,
it
was
almost
like
the
songs,
like
the
time
Serwyn
of
the
Mirror
Shield
saved
the
Princess
Daeryssa
from
the
giants,
or
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
championing
Queen
Naerys’s
honor
against
evil
Ser
Morgil’s
slanders.

The
touch
of
Joffrey’s
hand
on
her
sleeve
made
her
heart
beat
faster.
“What
would
you
like
to
do?”

Be
with
you,
Sansa
thought,
but
she
said,
“Whatever
you’d
like
to
do,
my
prince.”

Jofftey
reflected
a
moment.
“We
could
go
riding.”

“Oh,
I
love
riding,”
Sansa
said.

Joffrey
glanced
back
at
Lady,
who
was
following
at
their
heels.
“Your
wolf
is
liable
to
frighten
the
horses,
and
my
dog
seems
to
frighten
you.
Let
us
leave
them
both
behind
and
set
off
on
our
own,
what
do
you
say?”

Sansa
hesitated.
“If
you
like,”
she
said
uncertainly.
“I
suppose
I
could
tie
Lady
up.”
She
did
not
quite
understand,
though.
“I
didn’t
know
you
had
a
dog…”

Joffrey
laughed.
“He’s
my
mother’s
dog,
in
truth.
She
has
set
him
to
guard
me,
and
so
he
does.”

“You
mean
the
Hound,”
she
said.
She
wanted
to
hit
herself
for
being
so
slow.
Her
prince
would
never
love
her
if
she
seemed
stupid.
“Is
it
safe
to
leave
him
behind?”

Prince
Joffrey
looked
annoyed
that
she
would
even
ask.
“Have
no
fear,
lady.
I
am
almost
a
man
grown,
and
I
don’t
fight
with
wood
like
your
brothers.
All
I
need
is
this.”
He
drew
his
sword
and
showed
it
to
her;
a
longsword
adroitly
shrunken
to
suit
a
boy
of
twelve,
gleaming
blue
steel,
castle-forged
and
double-edged,
with
a
leather
grip
and
a
lion’s-head
pommel
in
gold.
Sansa
exclaimed
over
it
admiringly,
and
Joffrey
looked
pleased.
“I
call
it
Lion’s
Tooth,”
he
said.

And
so
they
left
her
direwolf
and
his
bodyguard
behind
them,
while
they
ranged
east
along
the
north
bank
of
the
Trident
with
no
company
save
Lion’s
Tooth.

It
was
a
glorious
day,
a
magical
day.
The
air
was
warm
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers,
and
the
woods
here
had
a
gentle
beauty
that
Sansa
had
never
seen
in
the
north.
Prince
Joffrey’s
mount
was
a
blood
bay
courser,
swift
as
the
wind,
and
he
rode
it
with
reckless
abandon,
so
fast
that
Sansa
was
hard-pressed
to
keep
up
on
her
mare.
It
was
a
day
for
adventures.
They
explored
the
caves
by
the
riverbank,
and
tracked
a
shadowcat
to
its
lair,
and
when
they
grew
hungry,
Joffrey
found
a
holdfast
by
its
smoke
and
told
them
to
fetch
food
and
wine
for
their
prince
and
his
lady.
They
dined
on
trout
fresh
from
the
river,
and
Sansa
drank
more
wine
than
she
had
ever
drunk
before.
“My
father
only
lets
us
have
one
cup,
and
only
at
feasts,”
she
confessed
to
her
prince.

“My
betrothed
can
drink
as
much
as
she
wants,”
Joffrey
said,
refilling
her
cup.

They
went
more
slowly
after
they
had
eaten.
Joffrey
sang
for
her
as
they
rode,
his
voice
high
and
sweet
and
pure.
Sansa
was
a
little
dizzy
from
the
wine.
“Shouldn’t
we
be
starting
back?”
she
asked.

“Soon,”
Joffrey
said.
“The
battleground
is
right
up
ahead,
where
the
river
bends.
That
was
where
my
father
killed
Rhaegar
Targaryen,
you
know.
He
smashed
in
his
chest,
crunch,
right
through
the
armor.”
Joffrey
swung
an
imaginary
warhammer
to
show
her
how
it
was
done.
“Then
my
uncle
Jaime
killed
old
Aerys,
and
my
father
was
king.
What’s
that
sound?”

Sansa
heard
it
too,
floating
through
the
woods,
a
kind
of
wooden
clattering,
snack
snack
snack.
“I
don’t
know,”
she
said.
It
made
her
nervous,
though.
“Joffrey,
let’s
go
back.”

“I
want
to
see
what
it
is.”
Joffrey
turned
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
sounds,
and
Sansa
had
no
choice
but
to
follow.
The
noises
grew
louder
and
more
distinct,
the
clack
of
wood
on
wood,
and
as
they
grew
closer
they
heard
heavy
breathing
as
well,
and
now
and
then
a
grunt.

“Someone’s
there,”
Sansa
said
anxiously.
She
found
herself
thinking
of
Lady,
wishing
the
direwolf
was
with
her.

“You’re
safe
with
me.”
Joffrey
drew
his
Lion’s
Tooth
from
its
sheath.
The
sound
of
steel
on
leather
made
her
tremble.
“This
way,”
he
said,
riding
through
a
stand
of
trees.

Beyond,
in
a
clearing
overlooking
the
river,
they
came
upon
a
boy
and
a
girl
playing
at
knights.
Their
swords
were
wooden
sticks,
broom
handles
from
the
look
of
them,
and
they
were
rushing
across
the
grass,
swinging
at
each
other
lustily.
The
boy
was
years
older,
a
head
taller,
and
much
stronger,
and
he
was
pressing
the
attack.
The
girl,
a
scrawny
thing
in
soiled
leathers,
was
dodging
and
managing
to
get
her
stick
in
the
way
of
most
of
the
boy’s
blows,
but
not
all.
When
she
tried
to
lunge
at
him,
he
caught
her
stick
with
his
own,
swept
it
aside,
and
slid
his
wood
down
hard
on
her
fingers.
She
cried
out
and
lost
her
weapon.

Prince
Joffrey
laughed.
The
boy
looked
around,
wide-eyed
and
startled,
and
dropped
his
stick
in
the
grass.
The
girl
glared
at
them,
sucking
on
her
knuckles
to
take
the
sting
out,
and
Sansa
was
horrified.
“Arya?”
she
called
out
incredulously.

“Go
away,”
Arya
shouted
back
at
them,
angry
tears
in
her
eyes.
“What
are
you
doing
here?
Leave
us
alone.”

Joffrey
glanced
from
Arya
to
Sansa
and
back
again.
“Your
sister?”
She
nodded,
blushing.
Joffrey
examined
the
boy,
an
ungainly
lad
with
a
coarse,
freckled
face
and
thick
red
hair.
“And
who
are
you,
boy?”
he
asked
in
a
commanding
tone
that
took
no
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
other
was
a
year
his
senior.

“Mycah,”
the
boy
muttered.
He
recognized
the
prince
and
averted
his
eyes.
“M’lord.”

“He’s
the
butcher’s
boy,”
Sansa
said.

“He’s
my
friend,”
Arya
said
sharply.
“You
leave
him
alone.”

“A
butcher’s
boy
who
wants
to
be
a
knight,
is
it?”
Joffrey
swung
down
from
his
mount,
sword
in
hand.
“Pick
up
your
sword,
butcher’s
boy,”
he
said,
his
eyes
bright
with
amusement.
“Let
us
see
how
good
you
are.”

Mycah
stood
there,
frozen
with
fear.

Joffrey
walked
toward
him.
“Go
on,
pick
it
up.
Or
do
you
only
fight
little
girls?”

“She
ast
me
to,
m’lord,”
Mycah
said.
“She
ast
me
to.”

Sansa
had
only
to
glance
at
Arya
and
see
the
flush
on
her
sister’s
face
to
know
the
boy
was
telling
the
truth,
but
Joffrey
was
in
no
mood
to
listen.
The
wine
had
made
him
wild.
“Are
you
going
to
pick
up
your
sword?”

Mycah
shook
his
head.
“It’s
only
a
stick,
m’lord.
It’s
not
no
sword,
it’s
only
a
stick.”

“And
you’re
only
a
butcher’s
boy,
and
no
knight.”
Joffrey
lifted
Lion’s
Tooth
and
laid
its
point
on
Mycah’s
cheek
below
the
eye,
as
the
butcher’s
boy
stood
trembling.
“That
was
my
lady’s
sister
you
were
hitting,
do
you
know
that?”
A
bright
bud
of
blood
blossomed
where
his
sword
pressed
into
Mycah’s
flesh,
and
a
slow
red
line
trickled
down
the
boy’s
cheek.

“Stop
it!”
Arya
screamed.
She
grabbed
up
her
fallen
stick.

Sansa
was
afraid.
“Arya,
you
stay
out
of
this.”

“I
won’t
hurt
him…
much,”
Prince
Joffrey
told
Arya,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
butcher’s
boy.

Arya
went
for
him.

Sansa
slid
off
her
mare,
but
she
was
too
slow.
Arya
swung
with
both
hands.
There
was
a
loud
crack
as
the
wood
split
against
the
back
of
the
prince’s
head,
and
then
everything
happened
at
once
before
Sansa’s
horrified
eyes.
Joffrey
staggered
and
whirled
around,
roaring
curses.
Mycah
ran
for
the
trees
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
take
him.
Arya
swung
at
the
prince
again,
but
this
time
Joffrey
caught
the
blow
on
Lion’s
Tooth
and
sent
her
broken
stick
flying
from
her
hands.
The
back
of
his
head
was
all
bloody
and
his
eyes
were
on
fire.
Sansa
was
shrieking,
“No,
no,
stop
it,
stop
it,
both
of
you,
you’re
spoiling
it,”
but
no
one
was
listening.
Arya
scooped
up
a
rock
and
hurled
it
at
Joffrey’s
head.
She
hit
his
horse
instead,
and
the
blood
bay
reared
and
went
galloping
off
after
Mycah.
“Stop
it,
don’t,
stop
it!”
Sansa
screamed.
Joffrey
slashed
at
Arya
with
his
sword,
screaming
obscenities,
terrible
words,
filthy
words.
Arya
darted
back,
frightened
now,
but
Joffrey
followed,
hounding
her
toward
the
woods,
backing
her
up
against
a
tree.
Sansa
didn’t
know
what
to
do.
She
watched
helplessly,
almost
blind
from
her
tears.

Then
a
grey
blur
flashed
past
her,
and
suddenly
Nymeria
was
there,
leaping,
jaws
closing
around
Joffrey’s
sword
arm.
The
steel
fell
from
his
fingers
as
the
wolf
knocked
him
off
his
feet,
and
they
rolled
in
the
grass,
the
wolf
snarling
and
ripping
at
him,
the
prince
shrieking
in
pain.
“Get
it
off,”
he
screamed.
“Get
it
off!”

Arya’s
voice
cracked
like
a
whip.
“Nymeria!”

The
direwolf
let
go
of
Joffrey
and
moved
to
Arya’s
side.
The
prince
lay
in
the
grass,
whimpering,
cradling
his
mangled
arm.
His
shirt
was
soaked
in
blood.
Arya
said,
“She
didn’t
hurt
you…
much.”
She
picked
up
Lion’s
Tooth
where
it
had
fallen,
and
stood
over
him,
holding
the
sword
with
both
hands.

Jofftey
made
a
scared
whimpery
sound
as
he
looked
up
at
her.
“No,”
he
said,
“don’t
hurt
me.
I’ll
tell
my
mother.”

“You
leave
him
alone!”
Sansa
screamed
at
her
sister.

Arya
whirled
and
heaved
the
sword
into
the
air,
putting
her
whole
body
into
the
throw.
The
blue
steel
flashed
in
the
sun
as
the
sword
spun
out
over
the
river.
It
hit
the
water
and
vanished
with
a
splash.
Joffrey
moaned.
Arya
ran
off
to
her
horse,
Nymeria
loping
at
her
heels.

After
they
had
gone,
Sansa
went
to
Prince
Joffrey.
His
eyes
were
closed
in
pain,
his
breath
ragged.
Sansa
knelt
beside
him.
“Joffrey,”
she
sobbed.
“Oh,
look
what
they
did,
look
what
they
did.
My
poor
prince.
Don’t
be
afraid.
I’ll
ride
to
the
holdfast
and
bring
help
for
you.”
Tenderly
she
reached
out
and
brushed
back
his
soft
blond
hair.

His
eyes
snapped
open
and
looked
at
her,
and
there
was
nothing
but
loathing
there,
nothing
but
the
vilest
contempt.
“Then
go,”
he
spit
at
her.
“And
don’t
touch
me.”





EDDARD

“They’ve
found
her,
my
lord.”

Ned
rose
quickly.
“Our
men
or
Lannister’s?”

“It
was
Jory,”
his
steward
Vayon
Poole
replied.
“She’s
not
been
harmed.”

“Thank
the
gods,”
Ned
said.
His
men
had
been
searching
for
Arya
for
four
days
now,
but
the
queen’s
men
had
been
out
hunting
as
well.
“Where
is
she?
Tell
Jory
to
bring
her
here
at
once.”

“I
am
sorry,
my
lord,”
Poole
told
him.
“The
guards
on
the
gate
were
Lannister
men,
and
they
informed
the
queen
when
Jory
brought
her
in.
She’s
being
taken
directly
before
the
king…”

“Damn
that
woman!”
Ned
said,
striding
to
the
door.
“Find
Sansa
and
bring
her
to
the
audience
chamber.
Her
voice
may
be
needed.”
He
descended
the
tower
steps
in
a
red
rage.
He
had
led
searches
himself
for
the
first
three
days,
and
had
scarcely
slept
an
hour
since
Arya
had
disappeared.
This
morning
he
had
been
so
heartsick
and
weary
he
could
scarcely
stand,
but
now
his
fury
was
on
him,
filling
him
with
strength.

Men
called
out
to
him
as
he
crossed
the
castle
yard,
but
Ned
ignored
them
in
his
haste.
He
would
have
run,
but
he
was
still
the
King’s
Hand,
and
a
Hand
must
keep
his
dignity.
He
was
aware
of
the
eyes
that
followed
him,
of
the
muttered
voices
wondering
what
he
would
do.

The
castle
was
a
modest
holding
a
half
day’s
ride
south
of
the
Trident.
The
royal
party
had
made
themselves
the
uninvited
guests
of
its
lord,
Ser
Raymun
Darry,
while
the
hunt
for
Arya
and
the
butcher’s
boy
was
conducted
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
They
were
not
welcome
visitors.
Ser
Raymun
lived
under
the
king’s
peace,
but
his
family
had
fought
beneath
Rhaegar’s
dragon
banners
at
the
Trident,
and
his
three
older
brothers
had
died
there,
a
truth
neither
Robert
nor
Ser
Raymun
had
forgotten.
With
king’s
men,
Darry
men,
Lannister
men,
and
Stark
men
all
crammed
into
a
castle
far
too
small
for
them,
tensions
burned
hot
and
heavy.

The
king
had
appropriated
Ser
Raymun’s
audience
chamber,
and
that
was
where
Ned
found
them.
The
room
was
crowded
when
he
burst
in.
Too
crowded,
he
thought;
left
alone,
he
and
Robert
might
have
been
able
to
settle
the
matter
amicably.

Robert
was
slumped
in
Darry’s
high
seat
at
the
far
end
of
the
room,
his
face
closed
and
sullen.
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
son
stood
beside
him.
The
queen
had
her
hand
on
Joffrey’s
shoulder.
Thick
silken
bandages
still
covered
the
boy’s
arm.

Arya
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room,
alone
but
for
Jory
Cassel,
every
eye
upon
her.
“Arya,”
Ned
called
loudly.
He
went
to
her,
his
boots
ringing
on
the
stone
floor.
When
she
saw
him,
she
cried
out
and
began
to
sob.

Ned
went
to
one
knee
and
took
her
in
his
arms.
She
was
shaking.
“I’m
sorry,”
she
sobbed,
“I’m
sorry,
I’m
sorry.”

“I
know,”
he
said.
She
felt
so
tiny
in
his
arms,
nothing
but
a
scrawny
little
girl.
It
was
hard
to
see
how
she
had
caused
so
much
trouble.
“Are
you
hurt?”

“No.”
Her
face
was
dirty,
and
her
tears
left
pink
tracks
down
her
cheeks.
“Hungry
some.
I
ate
some
berries,
but
there
was
nothing
else.”

“We’ll
feed
you
soon
enough,”
Ned
promised.
He
rose
to
face
the
king.
“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?”
His
eyes
swept
the
room,
searching
for
friendly
faces.
But
for
his
own
men,
they
were
few
enough.
Ser
Raymun
Darry
guarded
his
look
well.
Lord
Renly
wore
a
half
smile
that
might
mean
anything,
and
old
Ser
Barristan
was
grave;
the
rest
were
Lannister
men,
and
hostile.
Their
only
good
fortune
was
that
both
Jaime
Lannister
and
Sandor
Clegane
were
missing,
leading
searches
north
of
the
Trident.
“Why
was
I
not
told
that
my
daughter
had
been
found?”
Ned
demanded,
his
voice
ringing.
“Why
was
she
not
brought
to
me
at
once?”

He
spoke
to
Robert,
but
it
was
Cersei
Lannister
who
answered.
“How
dare
you
speak
to
your
king
in
that
manner!”

At
that,
the
king
stirred.
“Quiet,
woman,”
he
snapped.
He
straightened
in
his
seat.
“I
am
sorry,
Ned.
I
never
meant
to
frighten
the
girl.
It
seemed
best
to
bring
her
here
and
get
the
business
done
with
quickly.”

“And
what
business
is
that?”
Ned
put
ice
in
his
voice.

The
queen
stepped
forward.
“You
know
full
well,
Stark.
This
girl
of
yours
attacked
my
son.
Her
and
her
butcher’s
boy.
That
animal
of
hers
tried
to
tear
his
arm
off.”

“That’s
not
true,”
Arya
said
loudly.
“She
just
bit
him
a
little.
He
was
hurting
Mycah.”

“Joff
told
us
what
happened,”
the
queen
said.
“You
and
the
butcher
boy
beat
him
with
clubs
while
you
set
your
wolf
on
him.”

“That’s
not
how
it
was,”
Arya
said,
close
to
tears
again.
Ned
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder.

“Yes
it
is!”
Prince
Joffrey
insisted.
“They
all
attacked
me,
and
she
threw
Lion’s
Tooth
in
the
river!”
Ned
noticed
that
he
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
Arya
as
he
spoke.

“Liar!”
Arya
yelled.

“Shut
up!”
the
prince
yelled
back.

“Enough!”
the
king
roared,
rising
from
his
seat,
his
voice
thick
with
irritation.
Silence
fell.
He
glowered
at
Arya
through
his
thick
beard.
“Now,
child,
you
will
tell
me
what
happened.
Tell
it
all,
and
tell
it
true.
It
is
a
great
crime
to
lie
to
a
king.”
Then
he
looked
over
at
his
son.
“When
she
is
done,
you
will
have
your
turn.
Until
then,
hold
your
tongue.”

As
Arya
began
her
story,
Ned
heard
the
door
open
behind
him.
He
glanced
back
and
saw
Vayon
Poole
enter
with
Sansa.
They
stood
quietly
at
the
back
of
the
hall
as
Arya
spoke.
When
she
got
to
the
part
where
she
threw
Joffrey’s
sword
into
the
middle
of
the
Trident,
Renly
Baratheon
began
to
laugh.
The
king
bristled.
“Ser
Barristan,
escort
my
brother
from
the
hall
before
he
chokes.”

Lord
Renly
stifled
his
laughter.
“My
brother
is
too
kind.
I
can
find
the
door
myself.”
He
bowed
to
Joffrey.
“Perchance
later
you’ll
tell
me
how
a
nine-year-old
girl
the
size
of
a
wet
rat
managed
to
disarm
you
with
a
broom
handle
and
throw
your
sword
in
the
river.”
As
the
door
swung
shut
behind
him,
Ned
heard
him
say,
“Lion’s
Tooth,”
and
guffaw
once
more.

Prince
Joffrey
was
pale
as
he
began
his
very
different
version
of
events.
When
his
son
was
done
talking,
the
king
rose
heavily
from
his
seat,
looking
like
a
man
who
wanted
to
be
anywhere
but
here.
“What
in
all
the
seven
hells
am
I
supposed
to
make
of
this?
He
says
one
thing,
she
says
another.”

“They
were
not
the
only
ones
present,”
Ned
said.
“Sansa,
come
here.”
Ned
had
heard
her
version
of
the
story
the
night
Arya
had
vanished.
He
knew
the
truth.
“Tell
us
what
happened.”

His
eldest
daughter
stepped
forward
hesitantly.
She
was
dressed
in
blue
velvets
trimmed
with
white,
a
silver
chain
around
her
neck.
Her
thick
auburn
hair
had
been
brushed
until
it
shone.
She
blinked
at
her
sister,
then
at
the
young
prince.
“I
don’t
know,”
she
said
tearfully,
looking
as
though
she
wanted
to
bolt.
“I
don’t
remember.
Everything
happened
so
fast,
I
didn’t
see…”

“You
rotten!”
Arya
shrieked.
She
flew
at
her
sister
like
an
arrow,
knocking
Sansa
down
to
the
ground,
pummeling
her.
“Liar,
liar,
liar,
liar.”

“Arya,
stop
it!”
Ned
shouted.
Jory
pulled
her
off
her
sister,
kicking.
Sansa
was
pale
and
shaking
as
Ned
lifted
her
back
to
her
feet.
“Are
you
hurt?”
he
asked,
but
she
was
staring
at
Arya,
and
she
did
not
seem
to
hear.

“The
girl
is
as
wild
as
that
filthy
animal
of
hers,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
“Robert,
I
want
her
punished.”

“Seven
hells,”
Robert
swore.
“Cersei,
look
at
her.
She’s
a
child.
What
would
you
have
me
do,
whip
her
through
the
streets?
Damn
it,
children
fight.
It’s
over.
No
lasting
harm
was
done.”

The
queen
was
furious.
“Joff
will
carry
those
scars
for
the
rest
of
his
life.”

Robert
Baratheon
looked
at
his
eldest
son.
“So
he
will.
Perhaps
they
will
teach
him
a
lesson.
Ned,
see
that
your
daughter
is
disciplined.
I
will
do
the
same
with
my
son.”

“Gladly,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
said
with
vast
relief.

Robert
started
to
walk
away,
but
the
queen
was
not
done.
“And
what
of
the
direwolf?”
she
called
after
him.
“What
of
the
beast
that
savaged
your
son?”

The
king
stopped,
turned
back,
frowned.
“I’d
forgotten
about
the
damned
wolf.”

Ned
could
see
Arya
tense
in
Jory’s
arms.
Jory
spoke
up
quickly.
“We
found
no
trace
of
the
direwolf,
Your
Grace.”

Robert
did
not
look
unhappy.
“No?
So
be
it.”

The
queen
raised
her
voice.
“A
hundred
golden
dragons
to
the
man
who
brings
me
its
skin!”

“A
costly
pelt,”
Robert
grumbled.
“I
want
no
part
of
this,
woman.
You
can
damn
well
buy
your
furs
with
Lannister
gold.”

The
queen
regarded
him
coolly.
“I
had
not
thought
you
so
niggardly.
The
king
I’d
thought
to
wed
would
have
laid
a
wolfskin
across
my
bed
before
the
sun
went
down.”

Robert’s
face
darkened
with
anger.
“That
would
be
a
fine
trick,
without
a
wolf.”

“We
have
a
wolf,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
Her
voice
was
very
quiet,
but
her
green
eyes
shone
with
triumph.

It
took
them
all
a
moment
to
comprehend
her
words,
but
when
they
did,
the
king
shrugged
irritably.
“As
you
will.
Have
Ser
Ilyn
see
to
it.”

“Robert,
you
cannot
mean
this,”
Ned
protested.

The
king
was
in
no
mood
for
more
argument.
“Enough,
Ned,
I
will
hear
no
more.
A
direwolf
is
a
savage
beast.
Sooner
or
later
it
would
have
turned
on
your
girl
the
same
way
the
other
did
on
my
son.
Get
her
a
dog,
she’ll
be
happier
for
it.”

That
was
when
Sansa
finally
seemed
to
comprehend.
Her
eyes
were
frightened
as
they
went
to
her
father.
“He
doesn’t
mean
Lady,
does
he?”
She
saw
the
truth
on
his
face.
“No,”
she
said.
“No,
not
Lady,
Lady
didn’t
bite
anybody,
she’s
good…”

“Lady
wasn’t
there,”
Arya
shouted
angrily.
“You
leave
her
alone!”

“Stop
them,”
Sansa
pleaded,
“don’t
let
them
do
it,
please,
please,
it
wasn’t
Lady,
it
was
Nymeria,
Arya
did
it,
you
can’t,
it
wasn’t
Lady,
don’t
let
them
hurt
Lady,
I’ll
make
her
be
good,
I
promise,
I
promise…”
She
started
to
cry.

All
Ned
could
do
was
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
while
she
wept.
He
looked
across
the
room
at
Robert.
His
old
friend,
closer
than
any
brother.
“Please,
Robert.
For
the
love
you
bear
me.
For
the
love
you
bore
my
sister.
Please.”

The
king
looked
at
them
for
a
long
moment,
then
turned
his
eyes
on
his
wife.
“Damn
you,
Cersei,”
he
said
with
loathing.

Ned
stood,
gently
disengaging
himself
from
Sansa’s
grasp.
All
the
weariness
of
the
past
four
days
had
returned
to
him.
“Do
it
yourself
then,
Robert,”
he
said
in
a
voice
cold
and
sharp
as
steel.
“At
least
have
the
courage
to
do
it
yourself.”

Robert
looked
at
Ned
with
flat,
dead
eyes
and
left
without
a
word,
his
footsteps
heavy
as
lead.
Silence
filled
the
hall.

“Where
is
the
direwolf?”
Cersei
Lannister
asked
when
her
husband
was
gone.
Beside
her,
Prince
Joffrey
was
smiling.

“The
beast
is
chained
up
outside
the
gatehouse,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
answered
reluctantly.

“Send
for
Ilyn
Payne.”

“No,”
Ned
said.
“Jory,
take
the
girls
back
to
their
rooms
and
bring
me
Ice.”
The
words
tasted
of
bile
in
his
throat,
but
he
forced
them
out.
“If
it
must
be
done,
I
will
do
it.”

Cersei
Lannister
regarded
him
suspiciously.
“You,
Stark?
Is
this
some
trick?
Why
would
you
do
such
a
thing?”

They
were
all
staring
at
him,
but
it
was
Sansa’s
look
that
cut.
“She
is
of
the
north.
She
deserves
better
than
a
butcher.”

He
left
the
room
with
his
eyes
burning
and
his
daughter’s
wails
echoing
in
his
ears,
and
found
the
direwolf
pup
where
they
chained
her.
Ned
sat
beside
her
for
a
while.
“Lady,”
he
said,
tasting
the
name.
He
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
the
names
the
children
had
picked,
but
looking
at
her
now,
he
knew
that
Sansa
had
chosen
well.
She
was
the
smallest
of
the
litter,
the
prettiest,
the
most
gentle
and
trusting.
She
looked
at
him
with
bright
golden
eyes,
and
he
ruffled
her
thick
grey
fur.

Shortly,
Jory
brought
him
Ice.

When
it
was
over,
he
said,
“Choose
four
men
and
have
them
take
the
body
north.
Bury
her
at
Winterfell.”

“All
that
way?”
Jory
said,
astonished.

“All
that
way,”
Ned
affirmed.
“The
Lannister
woman
shall
never
have
this
skin.”

He
was
walking
back
to
the
tower
to
give
himself
up
to
sleep
at
last
when
Sandor
Clegane
and
his
riders
came
pounding
through
the
castle
gate,
back
from
their
hunt.

There
was
something
slung
over
the
back
of
his
destrier,
a
heavy
shape
wrapped
in
a
bloody
cloak.
“No
sign
of
your
daughter,
Hand,”
the
Hound
rasped
down,
“but
the
day
was
not
wholly
wasted.
We
got
her
little
pet.”
He
reached
back
and
shoved
the
burden
off,
and
it
fell
with
a
thump
in
front
of
Ned.

Bending,
Ned
pulled
back
the
cloak,
dreading
the
words
he
would
have
to
find
for
Arya,
but
it
was
not
Nymeria
after
all.
It
was
the
butcher’s
boy,
Mycah,
his
body
covered
in
dried
blood.
He
had
been
cut
almost
in
half
from
shoulder
to
waist
by
some
terrible
blow
struck
from
above.

“You
rode
him
down,”
Ned
said.

The
Hound’s
eyes
seemed
to
glitter
through
the
steel
of
that
hideous
dog’s-head
helm.
“He
ran.”
He
looked
at
Ned’s
face
and
laughed.
“But
not
very
fast.”





BRAN

It
seemed
as
though
he
had
been
falling
for
years.

Fly,
a
voice
whispered
in
the
darkness,
but
Bran
did
not
know
how
to
fly,
so
all
he
could
do
was
fall.

Maester
Luwin
made
a
little
boy
of
clay,
baked
him
till
he
was
hard
and
brittle,
dressed
him
in
Bran’s
clothes,
and
flung
him
off
a
roof.
Bran
remembered
the
way
he
shattered.
“But
I
never
fall,”
he
said,
falling.

The
ground
was
so
far
below
him
he
could
barely
make
it
out
through
the
grey
mists
that
whirled
around
him,
but
he
could
feel
how
fast
he
was
falling,
and
he
knew
what
was
waiting
for
him
down
there.
Even
in
dreams,
you
could
not
fall
forever.
He
would
wake
up
in
the
instant
before
he
hit
the
ground,
he
knew.
You
always
woke
up
in
the
instant
before
you
hit
the
ground.

And
if
you
don’t?
the
voice
asked.

The
ground
was
closer
now,
still
far
far
away,
a
thousand
miles
away,
but
closer
than
it
had
been.
It
was
cold
here
in
the
darkness.
There
was
no
sun,
no
stars,
only
the
ground
below
coming
up
to
smash
him,
and
the
grey
mists,
and
the
whispering
voice.
He
wanted
to
cry.

Not
cry.
Fly.

“I
can’t
fly,”
Bran
said.
“I
can’t,
I
can’t…”

How
do
you
know?
Have
you
ever
tried?

The
voice
was
high
and
thin.
Bran
looked
around
to
see
where
it
was
coming
from.
A
crow
was
spiraling
down
with
him,
just
out
of
reach,
following
him
as
he
fell.
“Help
me,”
he
said.

I’m
trying,
the
crow
replied.
Say,
got
any
corn?

Bran
reached
into
his
pocket
as
the
darkness
spun
dizzily
around
him.
When
he
pulled
his
hand
out,
golden
kernels
slid
from
between
his
fingers
into
the
air.
They
fell
with
him.

The
crow
landed
on
his
hand
and
began
to
eat.

“Are
you
really
a
crow?”
Bran
asked.

Are
you
really
falling?
the
crow
asked
back.

“It’s
just
a
dream,”
Bran
said.

Is
it?
asked
the
crow.

“I’ll
wake
up
when
I
hit
the
ground,”
Bran
told
the
bird.

You’ll
die
when
you
hit
the
ground,
the
crow
said.
It
went
back
to
eating
corn.

Bran
looked
down.
He
could
see
mountains
now,
their
peaks
white
with
snow,
and
the
silver
thread
of
rivers
in
dark
woods.
He
closed
his
eyes
and
began
to
cry.

That
won’t
do
any
good,
the
crow
said.
I
told
you,
the
answer
is
flying,
not
crying.
How
hard
can
it
be?
I’m
doing
it.
The
crow
took
to
the
air
and
flapped
around
Bran’s
hand.

“You
have
wings,”
Bran
pointed
out.

Maybe
you
do
too.

Bran
felt
along
his
shoulders,
groping
for
feathers.

There
are
different
kinds
of
wings,
the
crow
said.

Bran
was
staring
at
his
arms,
his
legs.
He
was
so
skinny,
just
skin
stretched
taut
over
bones.
Had
he
always
been
so
thin?
He
tried
to
remember.
A
face
swam
up
at
him
out
of
the
grey
mist,
shining
with
light,
golden.
“The
things
I
do
for
love,”
it
said.

Bran
screamed.

The
crow
took
to
the
air,
cawing.
Not
that,
it
shrieked
at
him.
Forget
that,
you
do
not
need
it
now,
put
it
aside,
put
it
away.
It
landed
on
Bran’s
shoulder,
and
pecked
at
him,
and
the
shining
golden
face
was
gone.

Bran
was
falling
faster
than
ever.
The
grey
mists
howled
around
him
as
he
plunged
toward
the
earth
below.
“What
are
you
doing
to
me?”
he
asked
the
crow,
tearful.

Teaching
you
how
to
fly.

“I
can’t
fly!”

You’re
flying
tight
now.

“I’m
falling!”

Every
flight
begins
with
a
fall,
the
crow
said.
Look
down.

“I’m
afraid…”

LOOK
DOWN!

Bran
looked
down,
and
felt
his
insides
turn
to
water.
The
ground
was
rushing
up
at
him
now.
The
whole
world
was
spread
out
below
him,
a
tapestry
of
white
and
brown
and
green.
He
could
see
everything
so
clearly
that
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
be
afraid.
He
could
see
the
whole
realm,
and
everyone
in
it.

He
saw
Winterfell
as
the
eagles
see
it,
the
tall
towers
looking
squat
and
stubby
from
above,
the
castle
walls
just
lines
in
the
dirt.
He
saw
Maester
Luwin
on
his
balcony,
studying
the
sky
through
a
polished
bronze
tube
and
frowning
as
he
made
notes
in
a
book.
He
saw
his
brother
Robb,
taller
and
stronger
than
he
remembered
him,
practicing
swordplay
in
the
yard
with
real
steel
in
his
hand.
He
saw
Hodor,
the
simple
giant
from
the
stables,
carrying
an
anvil
to
Mikken’s
forge,
hefting
it
onto
his
shoulder
as
easily
as
another
man
might
heft
a
bale
of
hay.
At
the
heart
of
the
godswood,
the
great
white
weirwood
brooded
over
its
reflection
in
the
black
pool,
its
leaves
rustling
in
a
chill
wind.
When
it
felt
Bran
watching,
it
lifted
its
eyes
from
the
still
waters
and
stared
back
at
him
knowingly.

He
looked
east,
and
saw
a
galley
racing
across
the
waters
of
the
Bite.
He
saw
his
mother
sitting
alone
in
a
cabin,
looking
at
a
bloodstained
knife
on
a
table
in
front
of
her,
as
the
rowers
pulled
at
their
oars
and
Ser
Rodrik
leaned
across
a
rail,
shaking
and
heaving.
A
storm
was
gathering
ahead
of
them,
a
vast
dark
roaring
lashed
by
lightning,
but
somehow
they
could
not
see
it.

He
looked
south,
and
saw
the
great
blue-green
rush
of
the
Trident.
He
saw
his
father
pleading
with
the
king,
his
face
etched
with
grief.
He
saw
Sansa
crying
herself
to
sleep
at
night,
and
he
saw
Arya
watching
in
silence
and
holding
her
secrets
hard
in
her
heart.
There
were
shadows
all
around
them.
One
shadow
was
dark
as
ash,
with
the
terrible
face
of
a
hound.
Another
was
armored
like
the
sun,
golden
and
beautiful.
Over
them
both
loomed
a
giant
in
armor
made
of
stone,
but
when
he
opened
his
visor,
there
was
nothing
inside
but
darkness
and
thick
black
blood.

He
lifted
his
eyes
and
saw
clear
across
the
narrow
sea,
to
the
Free
Cities
and
the
green
Dothraki
sea
and
beyond,
to
Vaes
Dothrak
under
its
mountain,
to
the
fabled
lands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
to
Asshai
by
the
Shadow,
where
dragons
stirred
beneath
the
sunrise.

Finally
he
looked
north.
He
saw
the
Wall
shining
like
blue
crystal,
and
his
bastard
brother
Jon
sleeping
alone
in
a
cold
bed,
his
skin
growing
pale
and
hard
as
the
memory
of
all
warmth
fled
from
him.
And
he
looked
past
the
Wall,
past
endless
forests
cloaked
in
snow,
past
the
frozen
shore
and
the
great
blue-white
rivers
of
ice
and
the
dead
plains
where
nothing
grew
or
lived.
North
and
north
and
north
he
looked,
to
the
curtain
of
light
at
the
end
of
the
world,
and
then
beyond
that
curtain.
He
looked
deep
into
the
heart
of
winter,
and
then
he
cried
out,
afraid,
and
the
heat
of
his
tears
burned
on
his
cheeks.

Now
you
know,
the
crow
whispered
as
it
sat
on
his
shoulder.
Now
you
know
why
you
must
live.

“Why?”
Bran
said,
not
understanding,
falling,
falling.

Because
winter
is
coming.

Bran
looked
at
the
crow
on
his
shoulder,
and
the
crow
looked
back.
It
had
three
eyes,
and
the
third
eye
was
full
of
a
terrible
knowledge.
Bran
looked
down.
There
was
nothing
below
him
now
but
snow
and
cold
and
death,
a
frozen
wasteland
where
jagged
blue-white
spires
of
ice
waited
to
embrace
him.
They
flew
up
at
him
like
spears.
He
saw
the
bones
of
a
thousand
other
dreamers
impaled
upon
their
points.
He
was
desperately
afraid.

“Can
a
man
still
be
brave
if
he’s
afraid?”
he
heard
his
own
voice
saying,
small
and
far
away.

And
his
father’s
voice
replied
to
him.
“That
is
the
only
time
a
man
can
be
brave.”

Now,
Bran,
the
crow
urged.
Choose.
Fly
or
die.

Death
reached
for
him,
screaming.

Bran
spread
his
arms
and
flew.

Wings
unseen
drank
the
wind
and
filled
and
pulled
him
upward.
The
terrible
needles
of
ice
receded
below
him.
The
sky
opened
up
above.
Bran
soared.
It
was
better
than
climbing.
It
was
better
than
anything.
The
world
grew
small
beneath
him.

“I’m
flying!”
he
cried
out
in
delight.

I’ve
noticed,
said
the
three-eyed
crow.
It
took
to
the
air,
flapping
its
wings
in
his
face,
slowing
him,
blinding
him.
He
faltered
in
the
air
as
its
pinions
beat
against
his
cheeks.
Its
beak
stabbed
at
him
fiercely,
and
Bran
felt
a
sudden
blinding
pain
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead,
between
his
eyes.

“What
are
you
doing?”
he
shrieked.

The
crow
opened
its
beak
and
cawed
at
him,
a
shrill
scream
of
fear,
and
the
grey
mists
shuddered
and
swirled
around
him
and
ripped
away
like
a
veil,
and
he
saw
that
the
crow
was
really
a
woman,
a
serving
woman
with
long
black
hair,
and
he
knew
her
from
somewhere,
from
Winterfell,
yes,
that
was
it,
he
remembered
her
now,
and
then
he
realized
that
he
was
in
Winterfell,
in
a
bed
high
in
some
chilly
tower
room,
and
the
black-haired
woman
dropped
a
basin
of
water
to
shatter
on
the
floor
and
ran
down
the
steps,
shouting,
“He’s
awake,
he’s
awake,
he’s
awake.”

Bran
touched
his
forehead,
between
his
eyes.
The
place
where
the
crow
had
pecked
him
was
still
burning,
but
there
was
nothing
there,
no
blood,
no
wound.
He
felt
weak
and
dizzy.
He
tried
to
get
out
of
bed,
but
nothing
happened.

And
then
there
was
movement
beside
the
bed,
and
something
landed
lightly
on
his
legs.
He
felt
nothing.
A
pair
of
yellow
eyes
looked
into
his
own,
shining
like
the
sun.
The
window
was
open
and
it
was
cold
in
the
room,
but
the
warmth
that
came
off
the
wolf
enfolded
him
like
a
hot
bath.
His
pup,
Bran
realized…
or
was
it?
He
was
so
big
now.
He
reached
out
to
pet
him,
his
hand
trembling
like
a
leaf.

When
his
brother
Robb
burst
into
the
room,
breathless
from
his
dash
up
the
tower
steps,
the
direwolf
was
licking
Bran’s
face.
Bran
looked
up
calmly.
“His
name
is
Summer,”
he
said.





CATELYN

“We
will
make
King’s
Landing
within
the
hour.”

Catelyn
turned
away
from
the
rail
and
forced
herself
to
smile.
“Your
oarmen
have
done
well
by
us,
Captain.
Each
one
of
them
shall
have
a
silver
stag,
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude.”

Captain
Moreo
Turnitis
favored
her
with
a
half
bow.
“You
are
far
too
generous,
Lady
Stark.
The
honor
of
carrying
a
great
lady
like
yourself
is
all
the
reward
they
need.”

“But
they’ll
take
the
silver
anyway.”

Moreo
smiled.
“As
you
say.”
He
spoke
the
Common
Tongue
fluently,
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
a
Tyroshi
accent.
He’d
been
plying
the
narrow
sea
for
thirty
years,
he’d
told
her,
as
oarman,
quartermaster,
and
finally
captain
of
his
own
trading
galleys.
The
Storm
Dancer
was
his
fourth
ship,
and
his
fastest,
a
two-masted
galley
of
sixty
oars.

She
had
certainly
been
the
fastest
of
the
ships
available
in
White
Harbor
when
Catelyn
and
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
had
arrived
after
their
headlong
gallop
downriver.
The
Tyroshi
were
notorious
for
their
avarice,
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
argued
for
hiring
a
fishing
sloop
out
of
the
Three
Sisters,
but
Catelyn
had
insisted
on
the
galley.
It
was
good
that
she
had.
The
winds
had
been
against
them
much
of
the
voyage,
and
without
the
galley’s
oars
they’d
still
be
beating
their
way
past
the
Fingers,
instead
of
skimming
toward
King’s
Landing
and
journey’s
end.

So
close,
she
thought.
Beneath
the
linen
bandages,
her
fingers
still
throbbed
where
the
dagger
had
bitten.
The
pain
was
her
scourge,
Catelyn
felt,
lest
she
forget.
She
could
not
bend
the
last
two
fingers
on
her
left
hand,
and
the
others
would
never
again
be
dexterous.
Yet
that
was
a
small
enough
price
to
pay
for
Bran’s
life.

Ser
Rodrik
chose
that
moment
to
appear
on
deck.
“My
good
friend,”
said
Moreo
through
his
forked
green
beard.
The
Tyroshi
loved
bright
colors,
even
in
their
facial
hair.
“It
is
so
fine
to
see
you
looking
better.”

“Yes,”
Ser
Rodrik
agreed.
“I
haven’t
wanted
to
die
for
almost
two
days
now.”
He
bowed
to
Catelyn.
“My
lady.”

He
was
looking
better.
A
shade
thinner
than
he
had
been
when
they
set
out
from
White
Harbor,
but
almost
himself
again.
The
strong
winds
in
the
Bite
and
the
roughness
of
the
narrow
sea
had
not
agreed
with
him,
and
he’d
almost
gone
over
the
side
when
the
storm
seized
them
unexpectedly
off
Dragonstone,
yet
somehow
he
had
clung
to
a
rope
until
three
of
Moreo’s
men
could
rescue
him
and
carry
him
safely
below
decks.

“The
captain
was
just
telling
me
that
our
voyage
is
almost
at
an
end,”
she
said.

Ser
Rodrik
managed
a
wry
smile.
“So
soon?”
He
looked
odd
without
his
great
white
side
whiskers;
smaller
somehow,
less
fierce,
and
ten
years
older.
Yet
back
on
the
Bite
it
had
seemed
prudent
to
submit
to
a
crewman’s
razor,
after
his
whiskers
had
become
hopelessly
befouled
for
the
third
time
while
he
leaned
over
the
rail
and
retched
into
the
swirling
winds.

“I
will
leave
you
to
discuss
your
business,”
Captain
Moreo
said.
He
bowed
and
took
his
leave
of
them.

The
galley
skimmed
the
water
like
a
dragonfly,
her
oars
rising
and
falling
in
perfect
time.
Ser
Rodrik
held
the
rail
and
looked
out
over
the
passing
shore.
“I
have
not
been
the
most
valiant
of
protectors.”

Catelyn
touched
his
arm.
“We
are
here,
Ser
Rodrik,
and
safely.
That
is
all
that
truly
matters.”
Her
hand
groped
beneath
her
cloak,
her
fingers
stiff
and
fumbling.
The
dagger
was
still
at
her
side.
She
found
she
had
to
touch
it
now
and
then,
to
reassure
herself.
“Now
we
must
reach
the
king’s
master-at-arms,
and
pray
that
he
can
be
trusted.”

“Ser
Aron
Santagar
is
a
vain
man,
but
an
honest
one.”
Ser
Rodrik’s
hand
went
to
his
face
to
stroke
his
whiskers
and
discovered
once
again
that
they
were
gone.
He
looked
nonplussed.
“He
may
know
the
blade,
yes…
but,
my
lady,
the
moment
we
go
ashore
we
are
at
risk.
And
there
are
those
at
court
who
will
know
you
on
sight.”

Catelyn’s
mouth
grew
tight.
“Littlefinger,”
she
murmured.
His
face
swam
up
before
her;
a
boy’s
face,
though
he
was
a
boy
no
longer.
His
father
had
died
several
years
before,
so
he
was
Lord
Baelish
now,
yet
still
they
called
him
Littlefinger.
Her
brother
Edmure
had
given
him
that
name,
long
ago
at
Riverrun.
His
family’s
modest
holdings
were
on
the
smallest
of
the
Fingers,
and
Petyr
had
been
slight
and
short
for
his
age.

Ser
Rodrik
cleared
his
throat.
“Lord
Baelish
once,
ah…”
His
thought
trailed
off
uncertainly
in
search
of
the
polite
word.

Catelyn
was
past
delicacy.
“He
was
my
father’s
ward.
We
grew
up
together
in
Riverrun.
I
thought
of
him
as
a
brother,
but
his
feelings
for
me
were…
more
than
brotherly.
When
it
was
announced
that
I
was
to
wed
Brandon
Stark,
Petyr
challenged
for
the
right
to
my
hand.
It
was
madness.
Brandon
was
twenty,
Petyr
scarcely
fifteen.
I
had
to
beg
Brandon
to
spare
Petyr’s
life.
He
let
him
off
with
a
scar.
Afterward
my
father
sent
him
away.
I
have
not
seen
him
since.”
She
lifted
her
face
to
the
spray,
as
if
the
brisk
wind
could
blow
the
memories
away.
“He
wrote
to
me
at
Riverrun
after
Brandon
was
killed,
but
I
burned
the
letter
unread.
By
then
I
knew
that
Ned
would
marry
me
in
his
brother’s
place.”

Ser
Rodrik’s
fingers
fumbled
once
again
for
nonexistent
whiskers.
“Littlefinger
sits
on
the
small
council
now.”

“I
knew
he
would
rise
high,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
was
always
clever,
even
as
a
boy,
but
it
is
one
thing
to
be
clever
and
another
to
be
wise.
I
wonder
what
the
years
have
done
to
him.”

High
overhead,
the
far-eyes
sang
out
from
the
rigging.
Captain
Moreo
came
scrambling
across
the
deck,
giving
orders,
and
all
around
them
the
Storm
Dancer
burst
into
frenetic
activity
as
King’s
Landing
slid
into
view
atop
its
three
high
hills.

Three
hundred
years
ago,
Catelyn
knew,
those
heights
had
been
covered
with
forest,
and
only
a
handful
of
fisherfolk
had
lived
on
the
north
shore
of
the
Blackwater
Rush
where
that
deep,
swift
river
flowed
into
the
sea.
Then
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
sailed
from
Dragonstone.
It
was
here
that
his
army
had
put
ashore,
and
there
on
the
highest
hill
that
he
built
his
first
crude
redoubt
of
wood
and
earth.

Now
the
city
covered
the
shore
as
far
as
Catelyn
could
see;
manses
and
arbors
and
granaries,
brick
storehouses
and
timbered
inns
and
merchant’s
stalls,
taverns
and
graveyards
and
brothels,
all
piled
one
on
another.
She
could
hear
the
clamor
of
the
fish
market
even
at
this
distance.
Between
the
buildings
were
broad
roads
lined
with
trees,
wandering
crookback
streets,
and
alleys
so
narrow
that
two
men
could
not
walk
abreast.
Visenya’s
hill
was
crowned
by
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
with
its
seven
crystal
towers.
Across
the
city
on
the
hill
of
Rhaenys
stood
the
blackened
walls
of
the
Dragonpit,
its
huge
dome
collapsing
into
ruin,
its
bronze
doors
closed
now
for
a
century.
The
Street
of
the
Sisters
ran
between
them,
straight
as
an
arrow.
The
city
walls
rose
in
the
distance,
high
and
strong.

A
hundred
quays
lined
the
waterfront,
and
the
harbor
was
crowded
with
ships.
Deepwater
fishing
boats
and
river
runners
came
and
went,
ferrymen
poled
back
and
forth
across
the
Blackwater
Rush,
trading
galleys
unloaded
goods
from
Braavos
and
Pentos
and
Lys.
Catelyn
spied
the
queen’s
ornate
barge,
tied
up
beside
a
fat-bellied
whaler
from
the
Port
of
Ibben,
its
hull
black
with
tar,
while
upriver
a
dozen
lean
golden
warships
rested
in
their
cribs,
sails
furled
and
cruel
iron
rams
lapping
at
the
water.

And
above
it
all,
frowning
down
from
Aegon’s
high
hill,
was
the
Red
Keep;
seven
huge
drum-towers
crowned
with
iron
ramparts,
an
immense
grim
barbican,
vaulted
halls
and
covered
bridges,
barracks
and
dungeons
and
granaries,
massive
curtain
walls
studded
with
archers’
nests,
all
fashioned
of
pale
red
stone.
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
commanded
it
built.
His
son
Maegor
the
Cruel
had
seen
it
completed.
Afterward
he
had
taken
the
heads
of
every
stonemason,
woodworker,
and
builder
who
had
labored
on
it.
Only
the
blood
of
the
dragon
would
ever
know
the
secrets
of
the
fortress
the
Dragonlords
had
built,
he
vowed.

Yet
now
the
banners
that
flew
from
its
battlements
were
golden,
not
black,
and
where
the
three-headed
dragon
had
once
breathed
fire,
now
pranced
the
crowned
stag
of
House
Baratheon.

A
high-masted
swan
ship
from
the
Summer
Isles
was
beating
out
from
port,
its
white
sails
huge
with
wind.
The
Storm
Dancer
moved
past
it,
pulling
steadily
for
shore.

“My
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
“I
have
thought
on
how
best
to
proceed
while
I
lay
abed.
You
must
not
enter
the
castle.
I
will
go
in
your
stead
and
bring
Ser
Aron
to
you
in
some
safe
place.”

She
studied
the
old
knight
as
the
galley
drew
near
to
a
pier.
Moreo
was
shouting
in
the
vulgar
Valyrian
of
the
Free
Cities.
“You
would
be
as
much
at
risk
as
I
would.”

Ser
Rodrik
smiled.
“I
think
not.
I
looked
at
my
reflection
in
the
water
earlier
and
scarcely
recognized
myself.
My
mother
was
the
last
person
to
see
me
without
whiskers,
and
she
is
forty
years
dead.
I
believe
I
am
safe
enough,
my
lady.”

Moreo
bellowed
a
command.
As
one,
sixty
oars
lifted
from
the
river,
then
reversed
and
backed
water.
The
galley
slowed.
Another
shout.
The
oars
slid
back
inside
the
hull.
As
they
thumped
against
the
dock,
Tyroshi
seamen
leapt
down
to
tie
up.
Moreo
came
bustling
up,
all
smiles.
“King’s
Landing,
my
lady,
as
you
did
command,
and
never
has
a
ship
made
a
swifter
or
surer
passage.
Will
you
be
needing
assistance
to
carry
your
things
to
the
castle?”

“We
shall
not
be
going
to
the
castle.
Perhaps
you
can
suggest
an
inn,
someplace
clean
and
comfortable
and
not
too
far
from
the
river.”

The
Tyroshi
fingered
his
forked
green
beard.
“Just
so.
I
know
of
several
establishments
that
might
suit
your
needs.
Yet
first,
if
I
may
be
so
bold,
there
is
the
matter
of
the
second
half
of
the
payment
we
agreed
upon.
And
of
course
the
extra
silver
you
were
so
kind
as
to
promise.
Sixty
stags,
I
believe
it
was.”

“For
the
oarmen,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

“Oh,
of
a
certainty,”
said
Moreo.
“Though
perhaps
I
should
hold
it
for
them
until
we
return
to
Tyrosh.
For
the
sake
of
their
wives
and
children.
If
you
give
them
the
silver
here,
my
lady,
they
will
dice
it
away
or
spend
it
all
for
a
night’s
pleasure.”

“There
are
worse
things
to
spend
money
on,”
Ser
Rodrik
put
in.
“Winter
is
coming.”

“A
man
must
make
his
own
choices,”
Catelyn
said.
“They
earned
the
silver.
How
they
spend
it
is
no
concern
of
mine.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady,”
Moreo
replied,
bowing
and
smiling.

Just
to
be
sure,
Catelyn
paid
the
oarmen
herself,
a
stag
to
each
man,
and
a
copper
to
the
two
men
who
carried
their
chests
halfway
up
Visenya’s
hill
to
the
inn
that
Moreo
had
suggested.
It
was
a
rambling
old
place
on
Eel
Alley.
The
woman
who
owned
it
was
a
sour
crone
with
a
wandering
eye
who
looked
them
over
suspiciously
and
bit
the
coin
that
Catelyn
offered
her
to
make
sure
it
was
real.
Her
rooms
were
large
and
airy,
though,
and
Moreo
swore
that
her
fish
stew
was
the
most
savory
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Best
of
all,
she
had
no
interest
in
their
names.

“I
think
it
best
if
you
stay
away
from
the
common
room,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
after
they
had
settled
in.
“Even
in
a
place
like
this,
one
never
knows
who
may
be
watching.”
He
wore
ringmail,
dagger,
and
longsword
under
a
dark
cloak
with
a
hood
he
could
pull
up
over
his
head.
“I
will
be
back
before
nightfall,
with
Ser
Aron,”
he
promised.
“Rest
now,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
was
tired.
The
voyage
had
been
long
and
fatiguing,
and
she
was
no
longer
as
young
as
she
had
been.
Her
windows
opened
on
the
alley
and
rooftops,
with
a
view
of
the
Blackwater
beyond.
She
watched
Ser
Rodrik
set
off,
striding
briskly
through
the
busy
streets
until
he
was
lost
in
the
crowds,
then
decided
to
take
his
advice.
The
bedding
was
stuffed
with
straw
instead
of
feathers,
but
she
had
no
trouble
falling
asleep.

She
woke
to
a
pounding
on
her
door.

Catelyn
sat
up
sharply.
Outside
the
window,
the
rooftops
of
King’s
Landing
were
red
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
She
had
slept
longer
than
she
intended.
A
fist
hammered
at
her
door
again,
and
a
voice
called
out,
“Open,
in
the
name
of
the
king.”

“A
moment,”
she
called
out.
She
wrapped
herself
in
her
cloak.
The
dagger
was
on
the
bedside
table.
She
snatched
it
up
before
she
unlatched
the
heavy
wooden
door.

The
men
who
pushed
into
the
room
wore
the
black
ringmail
and
golden
cloaks
of
the
City
Watch.
Their
leader
smiled
at
the
dagger
in
her
hand
and
said,
“No
need
for
that,
m’lady.
We’re
to
escort
you
to
the
castle.”

“By
whose
authority?”
she
said.

He
showed
her
a
ribbon.
Catelyn
felt
her
breath
catch
in
her
throat.
The
seal
was
a
mockingbird,
in
grey
wax.
“Petyr,”
she
said.
So
soon.
Something
must
have
happened
to
Ser
Rodrik.
She
looked
at
the
head
guardsman.
“Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“No,
m’lady,”
he
said.
“M’lord
Littlefinger
said
only
to
bring
you
to
him,
and
see
that
you
were
not
mistreated.”

Catelyn
nodded.
“You
may
wait
outside
while
I
dress.”

She
bathed
her
hands
in
the
basin
and
wrapped
them
in
clean
linen.
Her
fingers
were
thick
and
awkward
as
she
struggled
to
lace
up
her
bodice
and
knot
a
drab
brown
cloak
about
her
neck.
How
could
Littlefinger
have
known
she
was
here?
Ser
Rodrik
would
never
have
told
him.
Old
he
might
be,
but
he
was
stubborn,
and
loyal
to
a
fault.
Were
they
too
late,
had
the
Lannisters
reached
King’s
Landing
before
her?
No,
if
that
were
true,
Ned
would
be
here
too,
and
surely
he
would
have
come
to
her.
How…?

Then
she
thought,
Moreo.
The
Tyroshi
knew
who
they
were
and
where
they
were,
damn
him.
She
hoped
he’d
gotten
a
good
price
for
the
information.

They
had
brought
a
horse
for
her.
The
lamps
were
being
lit
along
the
streets
as
they
set
out,
and
Catelyn
felt
the
eyes
of
the
city
on
her
as
she
rode,
surrounded
by
the
guard
in
their
golden
cloaks.
When
they
reached
the
Red
Keep,
the
portcullis
was
down
and
the
great
gates
sealed
for
the
night,
but
the
castle
windows
were
alive
with
flickering
lights.
The
guardsmen
left
their
mounts
outside
the
walls
and
escorted
her
through
a
narrow
postern
door,
then
up
endless
steps
to
a
tower.

He
was
alone
in
the
room,
seated
at
a
heavy
wooden
table,
an
oil
lamp
beside
him
as
he
wrote.
When
they
ushered
her
inside,
he
set
down
his
pen
and
looked
at
her.
“Cat,”
he
said
quietly.

“Why
have
I
been
brought
here
in
this
fashion?”

He
rose
and
gestured
brusquely
to
the
guards.
“Leave
us.”
The
men
departed.
“You
were
not
mistreated,
I
trust,”
he
said
after
they
had
gone.
“I
gave
firm
instructions.”
He
noticed
her
bandages.
“Your
hands…”

Catelyn
ignored
the
implied
question.
“I
am
not
accustomed
to
being
summoned
like
a
serving
wench,”
she
said
icily.
“As
a
boy,
you
still
knew
the
meaning
of
courtesy.”

“I’ve
angered
you,
my
lady.
That
was
never
my
intent.”
He
looked
contrite.
The
look
brought
back
vivid
memories
for
Catelyn.
He
had
been
a
sly
child,
but
after
his
mischiefs
he
always
looked
contrite;
it
was
a
gift
he
had.
The
years
had
not
changed
him
much.
Petyr
had
been
a
small
boy,
and
he
had
grown
into
a
small
man,
an
inch
or
two
shorter
than
Catelyn,
slender
and
quick,
with
the
sharp
features
she
remembered
and
the
same
laughing
grey-green
eyes.
He
had
a
little
pointed
chin
beard
now,
and
threads
of
silver
in
his
dark
hair,
though
he
was
still
shy
of
thirty.
They
went
well
with
the
silver
mockingbird
that
fastened
his
cloak.
Even
as
a
child,
he
had
always
loved
his
silver.

“How
did
you
know
I
was
in
the
city?”
she
asked
him.

“Lord
Varys
knows
all,”
Petyr
said
with
a
sly
smile.
“He
will
be
joining
us
shortly,
but
I
wanted
to
see
you
alone
first.
It
has
been
too
long,
Cat.
How
many
years?”

Catelyn
ignored
his
familiarity.
There
were
more
important
questions.
“So
it
was
the
King’s
Spider
who
found
me.”

Littlefinger
winced.
“You
don’t
want
to
call
him
that.
He’s
very
sensitive.
Comes
of
being
an
eunuch,
I
imagine.
Nothing
happens
in
this
city
without
Varys
knowing.
Oftimes
he
knows
about
it
before
it
happens.
He
has
informants
everywhere.
His
little
birds,
he
calls
them.
One
of
his
little
birds
heard
about
your
visit.
Thankfully,
Varys
came
to
me
first.”

“Why
you?”

He
shrugged.
“Why
not
me?
I
am
master
of
coin,
the
king’s
own
councillor.
Selmy
and
Lord
Renly
rode
north
to
meet
Robert,
and
Lord
Stannis
is
gone
to
Dragonstone,
leaving
only
Maester
Pycelle
and
me.
I
was
the
obvious
choice.
I
was
ever
a
friend
to
your
sister
Lysa,
Varys
knows
that.”

“Does
Varys
know
about…”

“Lord
Varys
knows
everything…
except
why
you
are
here.”
He
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Why
are
you
here?”

“A
wife
is
allowed
to
yearn
for
her
husband,
and
if
a
mother
needs
her
daughters
close,
who
can
tell
her
no?”

Littlefinger
laughed.
“Oh,
very
good,
my
lady,
but
please
don’t
expect
me
to
believe
that.
I
know
you
too
well.
What
were
the
Tully
words
again?”

Her
throat
was
dry.
“Family,
Duty,
Honor,”
she
recited
stiffly.
He
did
know
her
too
well.

“Family,
Duty,
Honor,”
he
echoed.
“All
of
which
required
you
to
remain
in
Winterfell,
where
our
Hand
left
you.
No,
my
lady,
something
has
happened.
This
sudden
trip
of
yours
bespeaks
a
certain
urgency.
I
beg
of
you,
let
me
help.
Old
sweet
friends
should
never
hesitate
to
rely
upon
each
other.”
There
was
a
soft
knock
on
the
door.
“Enter,”
Littlefinger
called
out.

The
man
who
stepped
through
the
door
was
plump,
perfumed,
powdered,
and
as
hairless
as
an
egg.
He
wore
a
vest
of
woven
gold
thread
over
a
loose
gown
of
purple
silk,
and
on
his
feet
were
pointed
slippers
of
soft
velvet.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said,
taking
her
hand
in
both
of
his,
“to
see
you
again
after
so
many
years
is
such
a
joy.”
His
flesh
was
soft
and
moist,
and
his
breath
smelled
of
lilacs.
“Oh,
your
poor
hands.
Have
you
burned
yourself,
sweet
lady?
The
fingers
are
so
delicate…
Our
good
Maester
Pycelle
makes
a
marvelous
salve,
shall
I
send
for
a
jar?”

Catelyn
slid
her
fingers
from
his
grasp.
“I
thank
you,
my
lord,
but
my
own
Maester
Luwin
has
already
seen
to
my
hurts.”

Varys
bobbed
his
head.
“I
was
grievous
sad
to
hear
about
your
son.
And
him
so
young.
The
gods
are
cruel.”

“On
that
we
agree,
Lord
Varys,”
she
said.
The
title
was
but
a
courtesy
due
him
as
a
council
member;
Varys
was
lord
of
nothing
but
the
spiderweb,
the
master
of
none
but
his
whisperers.

The
eunuch
spread
his
soft
hands.
“On
more
than
that,
I
hope,
sweet
lady.
I
have
great
esteem
for
your
husband,
our
new
Hand,
and
I
know
we
do
both
love
King
Robert.”

“Yes,”
she
was
forced
to
say.
“For
a
certainty.”

“Never
has
a
king
been
so
beloved
as
our
Robert,”
quipped
Littlefinger.
He
smiled
slyly.
“At
least
in
Lord
Varys’s
hearing.”

“Good
lady,”
Varys
said
with
great
solicitude.
“There
are
men
in
the
Free
Cities
with
wondrous
healing
powers.
Say
only
the
word,
and
I
will
send
for
one
for
your
dear
Bran.”

“Maester
Luwin
is
doing
all
that
can
be
done
for
Bran,”
she
told
him.
She
would
not
speak
of
Bran,
not
here,
not
with
these
men.
She
trusted
Littlefinger
only
a
little,
and
Varys
not
at
all.
She
would
not
let
them
see
her
grief.
“Lord
Baelish
tells
me
that
I
have
you
to
thank
for
bringing
me
here.”

Varys
giggled
like
a
little
girl.
“Oh,
yes.
I
suppose
I
am
guilty.
I
hope
you
forgive
me,
kind
lady.”
He
eased
himself
down
into
a
seat
and
put
his
hands
together.
“I
wonder
if
we
might
trouble
you
to
show
us
the
dagger?”

Catelyn
Stark
stared
at
the
eunuch
in
stunned
disbelief.
He
was
a
spider,
she
thought
wildly,
an
enchanter
or
worse.
He
knew
things
no
one
could
possibly
know,
unless…“What
have
you
done
to
Ser
Rodrik?”
she
demanded.

Littlefinger
was
lost.
“I
feel
rather
like
the
knight
who
arrives
at
the
battle
without
his
lance.
What
dagger
are
we
talking
about?
Who
is
Ser
Rodrik?”

“Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
is
master-at-arms
at
Winterfell,”
Varys
informed
him.
“I
assure
you,
Lady
Stark,
nothing
at
all
has
been
done
to
the
good
knight.
He
did
call
here
early
this
afternoon.
He
visited
with
Ser
Aron
Santagar
in
the
armory,
and
they
talked
of
a
certain
dagger.
About
sunset,
they
left
the
castle
together
and
walked
to
that
dreadful
hovel
where
you
were
staying.
They
are
still
there,
drinking
in
the
common
room,
waiting
for
your
return.
Ser
Rodrik
was
very
distressed
to
find
you
gone.”

“How
could
you
know
all
that?”

“The
whisperings
of
little
birds,”
Varys
said,
smiling.
“I
know
things,
sweet
lady.
That
is
the
nature
of
my
service.”
He
shrugged.
“You
do
have
the
dagger
with
you,
yes?”

Catelyn
pulled
it
out
from
beneath
her
cloak
and
threw
it
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
him.
“Here.
Perhaps
your
little
birds
will
whisper
the
name
of
the
man
it
belongs
to.”

Varys
lifted
the
knife
with
exaggerated
delicacy
and
ran
a
thumb
along
its
edge.
Blood
welled,
and
he
let
out
a
squeal
and
dropped
the
dagger
back
on
the
table.

“Careful,”
Catelyn
told
him,
“it’s
sharp.”

“Nothing
holds
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel,”
Littlefinger
said
as
Varys
sucked
at
his
bleeding
thumb
and
looked
at
Catelyn
with
sullen
admonition.
Littlefinger
hefted
the
knife
lightly
in
his
hand,
testing
the
grip.
He
flipped
it
in
the
air,
caught
it
again
with
his
other
hand.
“Such
sweet
balance.
You
want
to
find
the
owner,
is
that
the
reason
for
this
visit?
You
have
no
need
of
Ser
Aron
for
that,
my
lady.
You
should
have
come
to
me.”

“And
if
I
had,”
she
said,
“what
would
you
have
told
me?”

“I
would
have
told
you
that
there
was
only
one
knife
like
this
at
King’s
Landing.”
He
grasped
the
blade
between
thumb
and
forefinger,
drew
it
back
over
his
shoulder,
and
threw
it
across
the
room
with
a
practiced
flick
of
his
wrist.
It
struck
the
door
and
buried
itself
deep
in
the
oak,
quivering.
“It’s
mine.”

“Yours?”
It
made
no
sense.
Petyr
had
not
been
at
Winterfell.

“Until
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day,”
he
said,
crossing
the
room
to
wrench
the
dagger
from
the
wood.
“I
backed
Ser
Jaime
in
the
jousting,
along
with
half
the
court.”
Petyr’s
sheepish
grin
made
him
look
half
a
boy
again.
“When
Loras
Tyrell
unhorsed
him,
many
of
us
became
a
trifle
poorer.
Ser
Jaime
lost
a
hundred
golden
dragons,
the
queen
lost
an
emerald
pendant,
and
I
lost
my
knife.
Her
Grace
got
the
emerald
back,
but
the
winner
kept
the
rest.”

“Who?”
Catelyn
demanded,
her
mouth
dry
with
fear.
Her
fingers
ached
with
remembered
pain.

“The
Imp,”
said
Littlefinger
as
Lord
Varys
watched
her
face.
“Tyrion
Lannister.”





JON

The
courtyard
rang
to
the
song
of
swords.

Under
black
wool,
boiled
leather,
and
mail,
sweat
trickled
icily
down
Jon’s
chest
as
he
pressed
the
attack.
Grenn
stumbled
backward,
defending
himself
clumsily.
When
he
raised
his
sword,
Jon
went
underneath
it
with
a
sweeping
blow
that
crunched
against
the
back
of
the
other
boy’s
leg
and
sent
him
staggering.
Grenn’s
downcut
was
answered
by
an
overhand
that
dented
his
helm.
When
he
tried
a
sideswing,
Jon
swept
aside
his
blade
and
slammed
a
mailed
forearm
into
his
chest.
Grenn
lost
his
footing
and
sat
down
hard
in
the
snow.
Jon
knocked
his
sword
from
his
fingers
with
a
slash
to
his
wrist
that
brought
a
cry
of
pain.

“Enough!”
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
had
a
voice
with
an
edge
like
Valyrian
steel.

Grenn
cradled
his
hand.
“The
bastard
broke
my
wrist.”

“The
bastard
hamstrung
you,
opened
your
empty
skull,
and
cut
off
your
hand.
Or
would
have,
if
these
blades
had
an
edge.
It’s
fortunate
for
you
that
the
Watch
needs
stableboys
as
well
as
rangers.”
Ser
Alliser
gestured
at
Jeren
and
Toad.
“Get
the
Aurochs
on
his
feet,
he
has
funeral
arrangements
to
make.”

Jon
took
off
his
helm
as
the
other
boys
were
pulling
Grenn
to
his
feet.
The
frosty
morning
air
felt
good
on
his
face.
He
leaned
on
his
sword,
drew
a
deep
breath,
and
allowed
himself
a
moment
to
savor
the
victory.

“That
is
a
longsword,
not
an
old
man’s
cane,”
Ser
Alliser
said
sharply.
“Are
your
legs
hurting,
Lord
Snow?”

Jon
hated
that
name,
a
mockery
that
Ser
Alliser
had
hung
on
him
the
first
day
he
came
to
practice.
The
boys
had
picked
it
up,
and
now
he
heard
it
everywhere.
He
slid
the
longsword
back
into
its
scabbard.
“No,”
he
replied.

Thorne
strode
toward
him,
crisp
black
leathers
whispering
faintly
as
he
moved.
He
was
a
compact
man
of
fifty
years,
spare
and
hard,
with
grey
in
his
black
hair
and
eyes
like
chips
of
onyx.
“The
truth
now,”
he
commanded.

“I’m
tired,”
Jon
admitted.
His
arm
burned
from
the
weight
of
the
longsword,
and
he
was
starting
to
feel
his
bruises
now
that
the
fight
was
done.

“What
you
are
is
weak.”

“I
won.”

“No.
The
Aurochs
lost.”

One
of
the
other
boys
sniggered.
Jon
knew
better
than
to
reply.
He
had
beaten
everyone
that
Ser
Alliser
had
sent
against
him,
yet
it
gained
him
nothing.
The
master-at-arms
served
up
only
derision.
Thorne
hated
him,
Jon
had
decided;
of
course,
he
hated
the
other
boys
even
worse.

“That
will
be
all,”
Thorne
told
them.
“I
can
only
stomach
so
much
ineptitude
in
any
one
day.
If
the
Others
ever
come
for
us,
I
pray
they
have
archers,
because
you
lot
are
fit
for
nothing
more
than
arrow
fodder.”

Jon
followed
the
rest
back
to
the
armory,
walking
alone.
He
often
walked
alone
here.
There
were
almost
twenty
in
the
group
he
trained
with,
yet
not
one
he
could
call
a
friend.
Most
were
two
or
three
years
his
senior,
yet
not
one
was
half
the
fighter
Robb
had
been
at
fourteen.
Dareon
was
quick
but
afraid
of
being
hit.
Pyp
used
his
sword
like
a
dagger,
Jeren
was
weak
as
a
girl,
Grenn
slow
and
clumsy.
Halder’s
blows
were
brutally
hard
but
he
ran
right
into
your
attacks.
The
more
time
he
spent
with
them,
the
more
Jon
despised
them.

Inside,
Jon
hung
sword
and
scabbard
from
a
hook
in
the
stone
wall,
ignoring
the
others
around
him.
Methodically,
he
began
to
strip
off
his
mail,
leather,
and
sweat-soaked
woolens.
Chunks
of
coal
burned
in
iron
braziers
at
either
end
of
the
long
room,
but
Jon
found
himself
shivering.
The
chill
was
always
with
him
here.
In
a
few
years
he
would
forget
what
it
felt
like
to
be
warm.

The
weariness
came
on
him
suddenly,
as
he
donned
the
roughspun
blacks
that
were
their
everyday
wear.
He
sat
on
a
bench,
his
fingers
fumbling
with
the
fastenings
on
his
cloak.
So
cold,
he
thought,
remembering
the
warm
halls
of
Winterfell,
where
the
hot
waters
ran
through
the
walls
like
blood
through
a
man’s
body.
There
was
scant
warmth
to
be
found
in
Castle
Black;
the
walls
were
cold
here,
and
the
people
colder.

No
one
had
told
him
the
Night’s
Watch
would
be
like
this;
no
one
except
Tyrion
Lannister.
The
dwarf
had
given
him
the
truth
on
the
road
north,
but
by
then
it
had
been
too
late.
Jon
wondered
if
his
father
had
known
what
the
Wall
would
be
like.
He
must
have,
he
thought;
that
only
made
it
hurt
the
worse.

Even
his
uncle
had
abandoned
him
in
this
cold
place
at
the
end
of
the
world.
Up
here,
the
genial
Benjen
Stark
he
had
known
became
a
different
person.
He
was
First
Ranger,
and
he
spent
his
days
and
nights
with
Lord
Commander
Mormont
and
Maester
Aemon
and
the
other
high
officers,
while
Jon
was
given
over
to
the
less
than
tender
charge
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.

Three
days
after
their
arrival,
Jon
had
heard
that
Benjen
Stark
was
to
lead
a
half-dozen
men
on
a
ranging
into
the
haunted
forest.
That
night
he
sought
out
his
uncle
in
the
great
timbered
common
hall
and
pleaded
to
go
with
him.
Benjen
refused
him
curtly.
“This
is
not
Winterfell,”
he
told
him
as
he
cut
his
meat
with
fork
and
dagger.
“On
the
Wall,
a
man
gets
only
what
he
earns.
You’re
no
ranger,
Jon,
only
a
green
boy
with
the
smell
of
summer
still
on
you.”

Stupidly,
Jon
argued.
“I’ll
be
fifteen
on
my
name
day,”
he
said.
“Almost
a
man
grown.”

Benjen
Stark
frowned.
“A
boy
you
are,
and
a
boy
you’ll
remain
until
Ser
Alliser
says
you
are
fit
to
be
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
If
you
thought
your
Stark
blood
would
win
you
easy
favors,
you
were
wrong.
We
put
aside
our
old
families
when
we
swear
our
vows.
Your
father
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
heart,
but
these
are
my
brothers
now.”
He
gestured
with
his
dagger
at
the
men
around
them,
all
the
hard
cold
men
in
black.

Jon
rose
at
dawn
the
next
day
to
watch
his
uncle
leave.
One
of
his
rangers,
a
big
ugly
man,
sang
a
bawdy
song
as
he
saddled
his
garron,
his
breath
steaming
in
the
cold
morning
air.
Ben
Stark
smiled
at
that,
but
he
had
no
smile
for
his
nephew.
“How
often
must
I
tell
you
no,
Jon?
We’ll
speak
when
I
return.”

As
he
watched
his
uncle
lead
his
horse
into
the
tunnel,
Jon
had
remembered
the
things
that
Tyrion
Lannister
told
him
on
the
kingsroad,
and
in
his
mind’s
eye
he
saw
Ben
Stark
lying
dead,
his
blood
red
on
the
snow.
The
thought
made
him
sick.
What
was
he
becoming?

Afterward
he
sought
out
Ghost
in
the
loneliness
of
his
cell,
and
buried
his
face
in
his
thick
white
fur.

If
he
must
be
alone,
he
would
make
solitude
his
armor.
Castle
Black
had
no
godswood,
only
a
small
sept
and
a
drunken
septon,
but
Jon
could
not
find
it
in
him
to
pray
to
any
gods,
old
or
new.
If
they
were
real,
he
thought,
they
were
as
cruel
and
implacable
as
winter.

He
missed
his
true
brothers:
little
Rickon,
bright
eyes
shining
as
he
begged
for
a
sweet;
Robb,
his
rival
and
best
friend
and
constant
companion;
Bran,
stubborn
and
curious,
always
wanting
to
follow
and
join
in
whatever
Jon
and
Robb
were
doing.
He
missed
the
girls
too,
even
Sansa,
who
never
called
him
anything
but
“my
half
brother”
since
she
was
old
enough
to
understand
what
bastard
meant.
And
Arya…
he
missed
her
even
more
than
Robb,
skinny
little
thing
that
she
was,
all
scraped
knees
and
tangled
hair
and
torn
clothes,
so
fierce
and
willful.
Arya
never
seemed
to
fit,
no
more
than
he
had…
yet
she
could
always
make
Jon
smile.
He
would
give
anything
to
be
with
her
now,
to
muss
up
her
hair
once
more
and
watch
her
make
a
face,
to
hear
her
finish
a
sentence
with
him.

“You
broke
my
wrist,
bastard
boy.”

Jon
lifted
his
eyes
at
the
sullen
voice.
Grenn
loomed
over
him,
thick
of
neck
and
red
of
face,
with
three
of
his
friends
behind
him.
He
knew
Todder,
a
short
ugly
boy
with
an
unpleasant
voice.
The
recruits
all
called
him
Toad.
The
other
two
were
the
ones
Yoren
had
brought
north
with
them,
Jon
remembered,
rapers
taken
down
in
the
Fingers.
He’d
forgotten
their
names.
He
hardly
ever
spoke
to
them,
if
he
could
help
it.
They
were
brutes
and
bullies,
without
a
thimble
of
honor
between
them.

Jon
stood
up.
“I’ll
break
the
other
one
for
you
if
you
ask
nicely.”
Grenn
was
sixteen
and
a
head
taller
than
Jon.
All
four
of
them
were
bigger
than
he
was,
but
they
did
not
scare
him.
He’d
beaten
every
one
of
them
in
the
yard.

“Maybe
we’ll
break
you,”
one
of
the
rapers
said.

“Try.”
Jon
reached
back
for
his
sword,
but
one
of
them
grabbed
his
arm
and
twisted
it
behind
his
back.

“You
make
us
look
bad,”
complained
Toad.

“You
looked
bad
before
I
ever
met
you,”
Jon
told
him.
The
boy
who
had
his
arm
jerked
upward
on
him,
hard.
Pain
lanced
through
him,
but
Jon
would
not
cry
out.

Toad
stepped
close.
“The
little
lordling
has
a
mouth
on
him,”
he
said.
He
had
pig
eyes,
small
and
shiny.
“Is
that
your
mommy’s
mouth,
bastard?
What
was
she,
some
whore?
Tell
us
her
name.
Maybe
I
had
her
a
time
or
two.”
He
laughed.

Jon
twisted
like
an
eel
and
slammed
a
heel
down
across
the
instep
of
the
boy
holding
him.
There
was
a
sudden
cry
of
pain,
and
he
was
free.
He
flew
at
Toad,
knocked
him
backward
over
a
bench,
and
landed
on
his
chest
with
both
hands
on
his
throat,
slamming
his
head
against
the
packed
earth.

The
two
from
the
Fingers
pulled
him
off,
throwing
him
roughly
to
the
ground.
Grenn
began
to
kick
at
him.
Jon
was
rolling
away
from
the
blows
when
a
booming
voice
cut
through
the
gloom
of
the
armory.
“STOP
THIS!
NOW!”

Jon
pulled
himself
to
his
feet.
Donal
Noye
stood
glowering
at
them.
“The
yard
is
for
fighting,”
the
armorer
said.
“Keep
your
quarrels
out
of
my
armory,
or
I’ll
make
them
my
quarrels.
You
won’t
like
that.”

Toad
sat
on
the
floor,
gingerly
feeling
the
back
of
his
head.
His
fingers
came
away
bloody.
“He
tried
to
kill
me.”

“’S
true.
I
saw
it,”
one
of
the
rapers
put
in.

“He
broke
my
wrist,”
Grenn
said
again,
holding
it
out
to
Noye
for
inspection.

The
armorer
gave
the
offered
wrist
the
briefest
of
glances.
“A
bruise.
Perhaps
a
sprain.
Maester
Aemon
will
give
you
a
salve.
Go
with
him,
Todder,
that
head
wants
looking
after.
The
rest
of
you,
return
to
your
cells.
Not
you,
Snow.
You
stay.”

Jon
sat
heavily
on
the
long
wooden
bench
as
the
others
left,
oblivious
to
the
looks
they
gave
him,
the
silent
promises
of
future
retribution.
His
arm
was
throbbing.

“The
Watch
has
need
of
every
man
it
can
get,”
Donal
Noye
said
when
they
were
alone.
“Even
men
like
Toad.
You
won’t
win
any
honors
killing
him.”

Jon’s
anger
flared.
“He
said
my
mother
was—”

“—a
whore.
I
heard
him.
What
of
it?”

“Lord
Eddard
Stark
was
not
a
man
to
sleep
with
whores,”
Jon
said
icily.
“His
honor—”

“—did
not
prevent
him
from
fathering
a
bastard.
Did
it?”

Jon
was
cold
with
rage.
“Can
I
go?”

“You
go
when
I
tell
you
to
go.”

Jon
stared
sullenly
at
the
smoke
rising
from
the
brazier,
until
Noye
took
him
under
the
chin,
thick
fingers
twisting
his
head
around.
“Look
at
me
when
I’m
talking
to
you,
boy.”

Jon
looked.
The
armorer
had
a
chest
like
a
keg
of
ale
and
a
gut
to
match.
His
nose
was
flat
and
broad,
and
he
always
seemed
in
need
of
a
shave.
The
left
sleeve
of
his
black
wool
tunic
was
fastened
at
the
shoulder
with
a
silver
pin
in
the
shape
of
a
longsword.
“Words
won’t
make
your
mother
a
whore.
She
was
what
she
was,
and
nothing
Toad
says
can
change
that.
You
know,
we
have
men
on
the
Wall
whose
mothers
were
whores.”

Not
my
mother,
Jon
thought
stubbornly.
He
knew
nothing
of
his
mother;
Eddard
Stark
would
not
talk
of
her.
Yet
he
dreamed
of
her
at
times,
so
often
that
he
could
almost
see
her
face.
In
his
dreams,
she
was
beautiful,
and
highborn,
and
her
eyes
were
kind.

“You
think
you
had
it
hard,
being
a
high
lord’s
bastard?”
the
armorer
went
on.
“That
boy
Jeren
is
a
septon’s
get,
and
Cotter
Pyke
is
the
baseborn
son
of
a
tavern
wench.
Now
he
commands
Eastwatch
by
the
Sea.”

“I
don’t
care,”
Jon
said.
“I
don’t
care
about
them
and
I
don’t
care
about
you
or
Thorne
or
Benjen
Stark
or
any
of
it.
I
hate
it
here.
It’s
too…
it’s
cold.”

“Yes.
Cold
and
hard
and
mean,
that’s
the
Wall,
and
the
men
who
walk
it.
Not
like
the
stories
your
wet
nurse
told
you.
Well,
piss
on
the
stories
and
piss
on
your
wet
nurse.
This
is
the
way
it
is,
and
you’re
here
for
life,
same
as
the
rest
of
us.”

“Life,”
Jon
repeated
bitterly.
The
armorer
could
talk
about
life.
He’d
had
one.
He’d
only
taken
the
black
after
he’d
lost
an
arm
at
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End.
Before
that
he’d
smithed
for
Stannis
Baratheon,
the
king’s
brother.
He’d
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms
from
one
end
to
the
other;
he’d
feasted
and
wenched
and
fought
in
a
hundred
battles.
They
said
it
was
Donal
Noye
who’d
forged
King
Robert’s
warhammer,
the
one
that
crushed
the
life
from
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident.
He’d
done
all
the
things
that
Jon
would
never
do,
and
then
when
he
was
old,
well
past
thirty,
he’d
taken
a
glancing
blow
from
an
axe
and
the
wound
had
festered
until
the
whole
arm
had
to
come
off.
Only
then,
crippled,
had
Donal
Noye
come
to
the
Wall,
when
his
life
was
all
but
over.

“Yes,
life,”
Noye
said.
“A
long
life
or
a
short
one,
it’s
up
to
you,
Snow.
The
road
you’re
walking,
one
of
your
brothers
will
slit
your
throat
for
you
one
night.”

“They’re
not
my
brothers,”
Jon
snapped.
“They
hate
me
because
I’m
better
than
they
are.”

“No.
They
hate
you
because
you
act
like
you’re
better
than
they
are.
They
look
at
you
and
see
a
castle-bred
bastard
who
thinks
he’s
a
lordling.”
The
armorer
leaned
close.
“You’re
no
lordling.
Remember
that.
You’re
a
Snow,
not
a
Stark.
You’re
a
bastard
and
a
bully.”

“A
bully?”
Jon
almost
choked
on
the
word.
The
accusation
was
so
unjust
it
took
his
breath
away.
“They
were
the
ones
who
came
after
me.
Four
of
them.”

“Four
that
you’ve
humiliated
in
the
yard.
Four
who
are
probably
afraid
of
you.
I’ve
watched
you
fight.
It’s
not
training
with
you.
Put
a
good
edge
on
your
sword,
and
they’d
be
dead
meat;
you
know
it,
I
know
it,
they
know
it.
You
leave
them
nothing.
You
shame
them.
Does
that
make
you
proud?”

Jon
hesitated.
He
did
feel
proud
when
he
won.
Why
shouldn’t
he?
But
the
armorer
was
taking
that
away
too,
making
it
sound
as
if
he
were
doing
something
wrong.
“They’re
all
older
than
me,”
he
said
defensively.

“Older
and
bigger
and
stronger,
that’s
the
truth.
I’ll
wager
your
master-at-arms
taught
you
how
to
fight
bigger
men
at
Winterfell,
though.
Who
was
he,
some
old
knight?”

“Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,”
Jon
said
warily.
There
was
a
trap
here.
He
felt
it
closing
around
him.

Donal
Noye
leaned
forward,
into
Jon’s
face.
“Now
think
on
this,
boy.
None
of
these
others
have
ever
had
a
master-at-arms
until
Ser
Alliser.
Their
fathers
were
farmers
and
wagonmen
and
poachers,
smiths
and
miners
and
oars
on
a
trading
galley.
What
they
know
of
fighting
they
learned
between
decks,
in
the
alleys
of
Oldtown
and
Lannisport,
in
wayside
brothels
and
taverns
on
the
kingsroad.
They
may
have
clacked
a
few
sticks
together
before
they
came
here,
but
I
promise
you,
not
one
in
twenty
was
ever
rich
enough
to
own
a
real
sword.”
His
look
was
grim.
“So
how
do
you
like
the
taste
of
your
victories
now,
Lord
Snow?”

“Don’t
call
me
that!”
Jon
said
sharply,
but
the
force
had
gone
out
of
his
anger.
Suddenly
he
felt
ashamed
and
guilty.
“I
never…
I
didn’t
think…”

“Best
you
start
thinking,”
Noye
warned
him.
“That,
or
sleep
with
a
dagger
by
your
bed.
Now
go.”

By
the
time
Jon
left
the
armory,
it
was
almost
midday.
The
sun
had
broken
through
the
clouds.
He
turned
his
back
on
it
and
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
Wall,
blazing
blue
and
crystalline
in
the
sunlight.
Even
after
all
these
weeks,
the
sight
of
it
still
gave
him
the
shivers.
Centuries
of
windblown
dirt
had
pocked
and
scoured
it,
covering
it
like
a
film,
and
it
often
seemed
a
pale
grey,
the
color
of
an
overcast
sky…
but
when
the
sun
caught
it
fair
on
a
bright
day,
it
shone,
alive
with
light,
a
colossal
blue-white
cliff
that
filled
up
half
the
sky.

The
largest
structure
ever
built
by
the
hands
of
man,
Benjen
Stark
had
told
Jon
on
the
kingsroad
when
they
had
first
caught
sight
of
the
Wall
in
the
distance.
“And
beyond
a
doubt
the
most
useless,”
Tyrion
Lannister
had
added
with
a
grin,
but
even
the
Imp
grew
silent
as
they
rode
closer.
You
could
see
it
from
miles
off,
a
pale
blue
line
across
the
northern
horizon,
stretching
away
to
the
east
and
west
and
vanishing
in
the
far
distance,
immense
and
unbroken.
This
is
the
end
of
the
world,
it
seemed
to
say.

When
they
finally
spied
Castle
Black,
its
timbered
keeps
and
stone
towers
looked
like
nothing
more
than
a
handful
of
toy
blocks
scattered
on
the
snow,
beneath
the
vast
wall
of
ice.
The
ancient
stronghold
of
the
black
brothers
was
no
Winterfell,
no
true
castle
at
all.
Lacking
walls,
it
could
not
be
defended,
not
from
the
south,
or
east,
or
west;
but
it
was
only
the
north
that
concerned
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
to
the
north
loomed
the
Wall.
Almost
seven
hundred
feet
high
it
stood,
three
times
the
height
of
the
tallest
tower
in
the
stronghold
it
sheltered.
His
uncle
said
the
top
was
wide
enough
for
a
dozen
armored
knights
to
ride
abreast.
The
gaunt
outlines
of
huge
catapults
and
monstrous
wooden
cranes
stood
sentry
up
there,
like
the
skeletons
of
great
birds,
and
among
them
walked
men
in
black
as
small
as
ants.

As
he
stood
outside
the
armory
looking
up,
Jon
felt
almost
as
overwhelmed
as
he
had
that
day
on
the
kingsroad,
when
he’d
seen
it
for
the
first
time.
The
Wall
was
like
that.
Sometimes
he
could
almost
forget
that
it
was
there,
the
way
you
forgot
about
the
sky
or
the
earth
underfoot,
but
there
were
other
times
when
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world.
It
was
older
than
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
when
he
stood
beneath
it
and
looked
up,
it
made
Jon
dizzy.
He
could
feel
the
great
weight
of
all
that
ice
pressing
down
on
him,
as
if
it
were
about
to
topple,
and
somehow
Jon
knew
that
if
it
fell,
the
world
fell
with
it.

“Makes
you
wonder
what
lies
beyond,”
a
familiar
voice
said.

Jon
looked
around.
“Lannister.
I
didn’t
see—I
mean,
I
thought
I
was
alone.”

Tyrion
Lannister
was
bundled
in
furs
so
thickly
he
looked
like
a
very
small
bear.
“There’s
much
to
be
said
for
taking
people
unawares.
You
never
know
what
you
might
learn.”

“You
won’t
learn
anything
from
me,”
Jon
told
him.
He
had
seen
little
of
the
dwarf
since
their
journey
ended.
As
the
queen’s
own
brother,
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
an
honored
guest
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
The
Lord
Commander
had
given
him
rooms
in
the
King’s
Tower—so-called,
though
no
king
had
visited
it
for
a
hundred
years—and
Lannister
dined
at
Mormont’s
own
table
and
spent
his
days
riding
the
Wall
and
his
nights
dicing
and
drinking
with
Ser
Alliser
and
Bowen
Marsh
and
the
other
high
officers.

“Oh,
I
learn
things
everywhere
I
go.”
The
little
man
gestured
up
at
the
Wall
with
a
gnarled
black
walking
stick.
“As
I
was
saying…
why
is
it
that
when
one
man
builds
a
wall,
the
next
man
immediately
needs
to
know
what’s
on
the
other
side?”
He
cocked
his
head
and
looked
at
Jon
with
his
curious
mismatched
eyes.
“You
do
want
to
know
what’s
on
the
other
side,
don’t
you?”

“It’s
nothing
special,”
Jon
said.
He
wanted
to
ride
with
Benjen
Stark
on
his
rangings,
deep
into
the
mysteries
of
the
haunted
forest,
wanted
to
fight
Mance
Rayder’s
wildlings
and
ward
the
realm
against
the
Others,
but
it
was
better
not
to
speak
of
the
things
you
wanted.
“The
rangers
say
it’s
just
woods
and
mountains
and
frozen
lakes,
with
lots
of
snow
and
ice.”

“And
the
grumkins
and
the
snarks,”
Tyrion
said.
“Let
us
not
forget
them,
Lord
Snow,
or
else
what’s
that
big
thing
for?”

“Don’t
call
me
Lord
Snow.”

The
dwarf
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Would
you
rather
be
called
the
Imp?
Let
them
see
that
their
words
can
cut
you,
and
you’ll
never
be
free
of
the
mockery.
If
they
want
to
give
you
a
name,
take
it,
make
it
your
own.
Then
they
can’t
hurt
you
with
it
anymore.”
He
gestured
with
his
stick.
“Come,
walk
with
me.
They’ll
be
serving
some
vile
stew
in
the
common
hall
by
now,
and
I
could
do
with
a
bowl
of
something
hot.”

Jon
was
hungry
too,
so
he
fell
in
beside
Lannister
and
slowed
his
pace
to
match
the
dwarf’s
awkward,
waddling
steps.
The
wind
was
rising,
and
they
could
hear
the
old
wooden
buildings
creaking
around
them,
and
in
the
distance
a
heavy
shutter
banging,
over
and
over,
forgotten.
Once
there
was
a
muffled
thump
as
a
blanket
of
snow
slid
from
a
roof
and
landed
near
them.

“I
don’t
see
your
wolf,”
Lannister
said
as
they
walked.

“I
chain
him
up
in
the
old
stables
when
we’re
training.
They
board
all
the
horses
in
the
east
stables
now,
so
no
one
bothers
him.
The
rest
of
the
time
he
stays
with
me.
My
sleeping
cell
is
in
Hardin’s
Tower.”

“That’s
the
one
with
the
broken
battlement,
no?
Shattered
stone
in
the
yard
below,
and
a
lean
to
it
like
our
noble
king
Robert
after
a
long
night’s
drinking?
I
thought
all
those
buildings
had
been
abandoned.”

Jon
shrugged.
“No
one
cares
where
you
sleep.
Most
of
the
old
keeps
are
empty,
you
can
pick
any
cell
you
want.”
Once
Castle
Black
had
housed
five
thousand
fighting
men
with
all
their
horses
and
servants
and
weapons.
Now
it
was
home
to
a
tenth
that
number,
and
parts
of
it
were
falling
into
ruin.

Tyrion
Lannister’s
laughter
steamed
in
the
cold
air.
“I’ll
be
sure
to
tell
your
father
to
arrest
more
stonemasons,
before
your
tower
collapses.”

Jon
could
taste
the
mockery
there,
but
there
was
no
denying
the
truth.
The
Watch
had
built
nineteen
great
strongholds
along
the
Wall,
but
only
three
were
still
occupied:
Eastwatch
on
its
grey
windswept
shore,
the
Shadow
Tower
hard
by
the
mountains
where
the
Wall
ended,
and
Castle
Black
between
them,
at
the
end
of
the
kingsroad.
The
other
keeps,
long
deserted,
were
lonely,
haunted
places,
where
cold
winds
whistled
through
black
windows
and
the
spirits
of
the
dead
manned
the
parapets.

“It’s
better
that
I’m
by
myself,”
Jon
said
stubbornly.
“The
rest
of
them
are
scared
of
Ghost.”

“Wise
boys,”
Lannister
said.
Then
he
changed
the
subject.
“The
talk
is,
your
uncle
is
too
long
away.”

Jon
remembered
the
wish
he’d
wished
in
his
anger,
the
vision
of
Benjen
Stark
dead
in
the
snow,
and
he
looked
away
quickly.
The
dwarf
had
a
way
of
sensing
things,
and
Jon
did
not
want
him
to
see
the
guilt
in
his
eyes.
“He
said
he’d
be
back
by
my
name
day,”
he
admitted.
His
name
day
had
come
and
gone,
unremarked,
a
fortnight
past.
“They
were
looking
for
Ser
Waymar
Royce,
his
father
is
bannerman
to
Lord
Arryn.
Uncle
Benjen
said
they
might
search
as
far
as
the
Shadow
Tower.
That’s
all
the
way
up
in
the
mountains.”

“I
hear
that
a
good
many
rangers
have
vanished
of
late,”
Lannister
said
as
they
mounted
the
steps
to
the
common
hall.
He
grinned
and
pulled
open
the
door.
“Perhaps
the
grumkins
are
hungry
this
year.”

Inside,
the
hall
was
immense
and
drafty,
even
with
a
fire
roaring
in
its
great
hearth.
Crows
nested
in
the
timbers
of
its
lofty
ceiling.
Jon
heard
their
cries
overhead
as
he
accepted
a
bowl
of
stew
and
a
heel
of
black
bread
from
the
day’s
cooks.
Grenn
and
Toad
and
some
of
the
others
were
seated
at
the
bench
nearest
the
warmth,
laughing
and
cursing
each
other
in
rough
voices.
Jon
eyed
them
thoughtfully
for
a
moment.
Then
he
chose
a
spot
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall,
well
away
from
the
other
diners.

Tyrion
Lannister
sat
across
from
him,
sniffing
at
the
stew
suspiciously.
“Barley,
onion,
carrot,”
he
muttered.
“Someone
should
tell
the
cooks
that
turnip
isn’t
a
meat.”

“It’s
mutton
stew.”
Jon
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
warmed
his
hands
in
the
steam
rising
from
the
bowl.
The
smell
made
his
mouth
water.

“Snow.”

Jon
knew
Alliser
Thorne’s
voice,
but
there
was
a
curious
note
in
it
that
he
had
not
heard
before.
He
turned.

“The
Lord
Commander
wants
to
see
you.
Now.”

For
a
moment
Jon
was
too
frightened
to
move.
Why
would
the
Lord
Commander
want
to
see
him?
They
had
heard
something
about
Benjen,
he
thought
wildly,
he
was
dead,
the
vision
had
come
true.
“Is
it
my
uncle?”
he
blurted.
“Is
he
returned
safe?”

“The
Lord
Commander
is
not
accustomed
to
waiting,”
was
Ser
Alliser’s
reply.
“And
I
am
not
accustomed
to
having
my
commands
questioned
by
bastards.”

Tyrion
Lannister
swung
off
the
bench
and
rose.
“Stop
it,
Thorne.
You’re
frightening
the
boy.”

“Keep
out
of
matters
that
don’t
concern
you,
Lannister.
You
have
no
place
here.”

“I
have
a
place
at
court,
though,”
the
dwarf
said,
smiling.
“A
word
in
the
right
ear,
and
you’ll
die
a
sour
old
man
before
you
get
another
boy
to
train.
Now
tell
Snow
why
the
Old
Bear
needs
to
see
him.
Is
there
news
of
his
uncle?”

“No,”
Ser
Alliser
said.
“This
is
another
matter
entirely.
A
bird
arrived
this
morning
from
Winterfell,
with
a
message
that
concerns
his
brother.”
He
corrected
himself.
“His
half
brother.”

“Bran,”
Jon
breathed,
scrambling
to
his
feet.
“Something’s
happened
to
Bran.”

Tyrion
Lannister
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm.
“Jon,”
he
said.
“I
am
truly
sorry.”

Jon
scarcely
heard
him.
He
brushed
off
Tyrion’s
hand
and
strode
across
the
hall.
He
was
running
by
the
time
he
hit
the
doors.
He
raced
to
the
Commander’s
Keep,
dashing
through
drifts
of
old
snow.
When
the
guards
passed
him,
he
took
the
tower
steps
two
at
a
time.
By
the
time
he
burst
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
Commander,
his
boots
were
soaked
and
Jon
was
wild-eyed
and
panting.
“Bran,”
he
said.
“What
does
it
say
about
Bran?”

Jeor
Mormont,
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
was
a
gruff
old
man
with
an
immense
bald
head
and
a
shaggy
grey
beard.
He
had
a
raven
on
his
arm,
and
he
was
feeding
it
kernels
of
corn.
“I
am
told
you
can
read.”
He
shook
the
raven
off,
and
it
flapped
its
wings
and
flew
to
the
window,
where
it
sat
watching
as
Mormont
drew
a
roll
of
paper
from
his
belt
and
handed
it
to
Jon.
“Corn,”
it
muttered
in
a
raucous
voice.
“Corn,
corn.”

Jon’s
finger
traced
the
outline
of
the
direwolf
in
the
white
wax
of
the
broken
seat.
He
recognized
Robb’s
hand,
but
the
letters
seemed
to
blur
and
run
as
he
tried
to
read
them.
He
realized
he
was
crying.
And
then,
through
the
tears,
he
found
the
sense
in
the
words,
and
raised
his
head.
“He
woke
up,”
he
said.
“The
gods
gave
him
back.”

“Crippled,”
Mormont
said.
“I’m
sorry,
boy.
Read
the
rest
of
the
letter.”

He
looked
at
the
words,
but
they
didn’t
matter.
Nothing
mattered.
Bran
was
going
to
live.
“My
brother
is
going
to
live,”
he
told
Mormont.
The
Lord
Commander
shook
his
head,
gathered
up
a
fistful
of
corn,
and
whistled.
The
raven
flew
to
his
shoulder,
crying,
“Live!
Live!”

Jon
ran
down
the
stairs,
a
smile
on
his
face
and
Robb’s
letter
in
his
hand.
“My
brother
is
going
to
live,”
he
told
the
guards.
They
exchanged
a
look.
He
ran
back
to
the
common
hall,
where
he
found
Tyrion
Lannister
just
finishing
his
meal.
He
grabbed
the
little
man
under
the
arms,
hoisted
him
up
in
the
air,
and
spun
him
around
in
a
circle.
“Bran
is
going
to
live!”
he
whooped.
Lannister
looked
startled.
Jon
put
him
down
and
thrust
the
paper
into
his
hands.
“Here,
read
it,”
he
said.

Others
were
gathering
around
and
looking
at
him
curiously.
Jon
noticed
Grenn
a
few
feet
away.
A
thick
woolen
bandage
was
wrapped
around
one
hand.
He
looked
anxious
and
uncomfortable,
not
menacing
at
all.
Jon
went
to
him.
Grenn
edged
backward
and
put
up
his
hands.
“Stay
away
from
me
now,
you
bastard.”

Jon
smiled
at
him.
“I’m
sorry
about
your
wrist.
Robb
used
the
same
move
on
me
once,
only
with
a
wooden
blade.
It
hurt
like
seven
hells,
but
yours
must
be
worse.
Look,
if
you
want,
I
can
show
you
how
to
defend
that.”

Alliser
Thorne
overheard
him.
“Lord
Snow
wants
to
take
my
place
now.”
He
sneered.
“I’d
have
an
easier
time
teaching
a
wolf
to
juggle
than
you
will
training
this
aurochs.”

“I’ll
take
that
wager,
Ser
Alliser,”
Jon
said.
“I’d
love
to
see
Ghost
juggle.”

Jon
heard
Grenn
suck
in
his
breath,
shocked.
Silence
fell.

Then
Tyrion
Lannister
guffawed.
Three
of
the
black
brothers
joined
in
from
a
nearby
table.
The
laughter
spread
up
and
down
the
benches,
until
even
the
cooks
joined
in.
The
birds
stirred
in
the
rafters,
and
finally
even
Grenn
began
to
chuckle.

Ser
Alliser
never
took
his
eyes
from
Jon.
As
the
laughter
rolled
around
him,
his
face
darkened,
and
his
sword
hand
curled
into
a
fist.
“That
was
a
grievous
error,
Lord
Snow,”
he
said
at
last
in
the
acid
tones
of
an
enemy.





EDDARD

Eddard
Stark
rode
through
the
towering
bronze
doors
of
the
Red
Keep
sore,
tired,
hungry,
and
irritable.
He
was
still
ahorse,
dreaming
of
a
long
hot
soak,
a
roast
fowl,
and
a
featherbed,
when
the
king’s
steward
told
him
that
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
convened
an
urgent
meeting
of
the
small
council.
The
honor
of
the
Hand’s
presence
was
requested
as
soon
as
it
was
convenient.
“It
will
be
convenient
on
the
morrow,”
Ned
snapped
as
he
dismounted.

The
steward
bowed
very
low.
“I
shall
give
the
councillors
your
regrets,
my
lord.”

“No,
damn
it,”
Ned
said.
It
would
not
do
to
offend
the
council
before
he
had
even
begun.
“I
will
see
them.
Pray
give
me
a
few
moments
to
change
into
something
more
presentable.”

“Yes,
my
lord,”
the
steward
said.
“We
have
given
you
Lord
Arryn’s
former
chambers
in
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
if
it
please
you.
I
shall
have
your
things
taken
there.”

“My
thanks,”
Ned
said
as
he
ripped
off
his
riding
gloves
and
tucked
them
into
his
belt.
The
rest
of
his
household
was
coming
through
the
gate
behind
him.
Ned
saw
Vayon
Poole,
his
own
steward,
and
called
out.
“It
seems
the
council
has
urgent
need
of
me.
See
that
my
daughters
find
their
bedchambers,
and
tell
Jory
to
keep
them
there.
Arya
is
not
to
go
exploring.”
Poole
bowed.
Ned
turned
back
to
the
royal
steward.
“My
wagons
are
still
straggling
through
the
city.
I
shall
need
appropriate
garments.”

“It
will
be
my
great
pleasure,”
the
steward
said.

And
so
Ned
had
come
striding
into
the
council
chambers,
bone-tired
and
dressed
in
borrowed
clothing,
to
find
four
members
of
the
small
council
waiting
for
him.

The
chamber
was
richly
furnished.
Myrish
carpets
covered
the
floor
instead
of
rushes,
and
in
one
corner
a
hundred
fabulous
beasts
cavorted
in
bright
paints
on
a
carved
screen
from
the
Summer
Isles.
The
walls
were
hung
with
tapestries
from
Norvos
and
Qohor
and
Lys,
and
a
pair
of
Valyrian
sphinxes
flanked
the
door,
eyes
of
polished
garnet
smoldering
in
black
marble
faces.

The
councillor
Ned
liked
least,
the
eunuch
Varys,
accosted
him
the
moment
he
entered.
“Lord
Stark,
I
was
grievous
sad
to
hear
about
your
troubles
on
the
kingsroad.
We
have
all
been
visiting
the
sept
to
light
candles
for
Prince
Joffrey.
I
pray
for
his
recovery.”
His
hand
left
powder
stains
on
Ned’s
sleeve,
and
he
smelled
as
foul
and
sweet
as
flowers
on
a
grave.

“Your
gods
have
heard
you,”
Ned
replied,
cool
yet
polite.
“The
prince
grows
stronger
every
day.”
He
disentangled
himself
from
the
eunuch’s
grip
and
crossed
the
room
to
where
Lord
Renly
stood
by
the
screen,
talking
quietly
with
a
short
man
who
could
only
be
Littlefinger.
Renly
had
been
a
boy
of
eight
when
Robert
won
the
throne,
but
he
had
grown
into
a
man
so
like
his
brother
that
Ned
found
it
disconcerting.
Whenever
he
saw
him,
it
was
as
if
the
years
had
slipped
away
and
Robert
stood
before
him,
fresh
from
his
victory
on
the
Trident.

“I
see
you
have
arrived
safely,
Lord
Stark,”
Renly
said.

“And
you
as
well,”
Ned
replied.
“You
must
forgive
me,
but
sometimes
you
look
the
very
image
of
your
brother
Robert.”

“A
poor
copy,”
Renly
said
with
a
shrug.

“Though
much
better
dressed,”
Littlefinger
quipped.
“Lord
Renly
spends
more
on
clothing
than
half
the
ladies
of
the
court.”

It
was
true
enough.
Lord
Renly
was
in
dark
green
velvet,
with
a
dozen
golden
stags
embroidered
on
his
doublet.
A
cloth-of-gold
half
cape
was
draped
casually
across
one
shoulder,
fastened
with
an
emerald
brooch.
“There
are
worse
crimes,”
Renly
said
with
a
laugh.
“The
way
you
dress,
for
one.”

Littlefinger
ignored
the
jibe.
He
eyed
Ned
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
that
bordered
on
insolence.
“I
have
hoped
to
meet
you
for
some
years,
Lord
Stark.
No
doubt
Lady
Catelyn
has
mentioned
me
to
you.”

“She
has,”
Ned
replied
with
a
chill
in
his
voice.
The
sly
arrogance
of
the
comment
rankled
him.
“I
understand
you
knew
my
brother
Brandon
as
well.”

Renly
Baratheon
laughed.
Varys
shuffled
over
to
listen.

“Rather
too
well,”
Littlefinger
said.
“I
still
carry
a
token
of
his
esteem.
Did
Brandon
speak
of
me
too?”

“Often,
and
with
some
heat,”
Ned
said,
hoping
that
would
end
it.
He
had
no
patience
with
this
game
they
played,
this
dueling
with
words.

“I
should
have
thought
that
heat
ill
suits
you
Starks,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Here
in
the
south,
they
say
you
are
all
made
of
ice,
and
melt
when
you
ride
below
the
Neck.”

“I
do
not
plan
on
melting
soon,
Lord
Baelish.
You
may
count
on
it.”
Ned
moved
to
the
council
table
and
said,
“Maester
Pycelle,
I
trust
you
are
well.”

The
Grand
Maester
smiled
gently
from
his
tall
chair
at
the
foot
of
the
table.
“Well
enough
for
a
man
of
my
years,
my
lord,”
he
replied,
“yet
I
do
tire
easily,
I
fear.”
Wispy
strands
of
white
hair
fringed
the
broad
bald
dome
of
his
forehead
above
a
kindly
face.
His
maester’s
collar
was
no
simple
metal
choker
such
as
Luwin
wore,
but
two
dozen
heavy
chains
wound
together
into
a
ponderous
metal
necklace
that
covered
him
from
throat
to
breast.
The
links
were
forged
of
every
metal
known
to
man:
black
iron
and
red
gold,
bright
copper
and
dull
lead,
steel
and
tin
and
pale
silver,
brass
and
bronze
and
platinum.
Garnets
and
amethysts
and
black
pearls
adorned
the
metalwork,
and
here
and
there
an
emerald
or
ruby.
“Perhaps
we
might
begin
soon,”
the
Grand
Maester
said,
hands
knitting
together
atop
his
broad
stomach.
“I
fear
I
shall
fall
asleep
if
we
wait
much
longer.”

“As
you
will.”
The
king’s
seat
sat
empty
at
the
head
of
the
table,
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
embroidered
in
gold
thread
on
its
pillows.
Ned
took
the
chair
beside
it,
as
the
right
hand
of
his
king.
“My
lords,”
he
said
formally,
“I
am
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting.”

“You
are
the
King’s
Hand,”
Varys
said.
“We
serve
at
your
pleasure,
Lord
Stark.”

As
the
others
took
their
accustomed
seats,
it
struck
Eddard
Stark
forcefully
that
he
did
not
belong
here,
in
this
room,
with
these
men.
He
remembered
what
Robert
had
told
him
in
the
crypts
below
Winterfell.
I
am
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
fools,
the
king
had
insisted.
Ned
looked
down
the
council
table
and
wondered
which
were
the
flatterers
and
which
the
fools.
He
thought
he
knew
already.
“We
are
but
five,”
he
pointed
out.

“Lord
Stannis
took
himself
to
Dragonstone
not
long
after
the
king
went
north,”
Varys
said,
“and
our
gallant
Ser
Barristan
no
doubt
rides
beside
the
king
as
he
makes
his
way
through
the
city,
as
befits
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Perhaps
we
had
best
wait
for
Ser
Barristan
and
the
king
to
join
us,”
Ned
suggested.

Renly
Baratheon
laughed
aloud.
“If
we
wait
for
my
brother
to
grace
us
with
his
royal
presence,
it
could
be
a
long
sit.”

“Our
good
King
Robert
has
many
cares,”
Varys
said.
“He
entrusts
some
small
matters
to
us,
to
lighten
his
load.”

“What
Lord
Varys
means
is
that
all
this
business
of
coin
and
crops
and
justice
bores
my
royal
brother
to
tears,”
Lord
Renly
said,
“so
it
falls
to
us
to
govern
the
realm.
He
does
send
us
a
command
from
time
to
time.”
He
drew
a
tightly
rolled
paper
from
his
sleeve
and
laid
it
on
the
table.
“This
morning
he
commanded
me
to
ride
ahead
with
all
haste
and
ask
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
convene
this
council
at
once.
He
has
an
urgent
task
for
us.”

Littlefinger
smiled
and
handed
the
paper
to
Ned.
It
bore
the
royal
seal.
Ned
broke
the
wax
with
his
thumb
and
flattened
the
letter
to
consider
the
king’s
urgent
command,
reading
the
words
with
mounting
disbelief.
Was
there
no
end
to
Robert’s
folly?
And
to
do
this
in
his
name,
that
was
salt
in
the
wound.
“Gods
be
good,”
he
swore.

“What
Lord
Eddard
means
to
say,”
Lord
Renly
announced,
“is
that
His
Grace
instructs
us
to
stage
a
great
tournament
in
honor
of
his
appointment
as
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

“How
much?”
asked
Littlefinger,
mildly.

Ned
read
the
answer
off
the
letter.
“Forty
thousand
golden
dragons
to
the
champion.
Twenty
thousand
to
the
man
who
comes
second,
another
twenty
to
the
winner
of
the
melee,
and
ten
thousand
to
the
victor
of
the
archery
competition.”

“Ninety
thousand
gold
pieces,”
Littlefinger
sighed.
“And
we
must
not
neglect
the
other
costs.
Robert
will
want
a
prodigious
feast.
That
means
cooks,
carpenters,
serving
girls,
singers,
jugglers,
fools…”

“Fools
we
have
in
plenty,”
Lord
Renly
said.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
looked
to
Littlefinger
and
asked,
“Will
the
treasury
bear
the
expense?”

“What
treasury
is
that?”
Littlefinger
replied
with
a
twist
of
his
mouth.
“Spare
me
the
foolishness,
Maester.
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
the
treasury
has
been
empty
for
years.
I
shall
have
to
borrow
the
money.
No
doubt
the
Lannisters
will
be
accommodating.
We
owe
Lord
Tywin
some
three
million
dragons
at
present,
what
matter
another
hundred
thousand?”

Ned
was
stunned.
“Are
you
claiming
that
the
Crown
is
three
million
gold
pieces
in
debt?”

“The
Crown
is
more
than
six
million
gold
pieces
in
debt,
Lord
Stark.
The
Lannisters
are
the
biggest
part
of
it,
but
we
have
also
borrowed
from
Lord
Tyrell,
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos,
and
several
Tyroshi
trading
cartels.
Of
late
I’ve
had
to
turn
to
the
Faith.
The
High
Septon
haggles
worse
than
a
Dornish
fishmonger.”

Ned
was
aghast.
“Aerys
Targaryen
left
a
treasury
flowing
with
gold.
How
could
you
let
this
happen?”

Littlefinger
gave
a
shrug.
“The
master
of
coin
finds
the
money.
The
king
and
the
Hand
spend
it.”

“I
will
not
believe
that
Jon
Arryn
allowed
Robert
to
beggar
the
realm,”
Ned
said
hotly.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
shook
his
great
bald
head,
his
chains
clinking
softly.
“Lord
Arryn
was
a
prudent
man,
but
I
fear
that
His
Grace
does
not
always
listen
to
wise
counsel.”

“My
royal
brother
loves
tournaments
and
feasts,”
Renly
Baratheon
said,
“and
he
loathes
what
he
calls
‘counting
coppers.’”

“I
will
speak
with
His
Grace,”
Ned
said.
“This
tourney
is
an
extravagance
the
realm
cannot
afford.”

“Speak
to
him
as
you
will,”
Lord
Renly
said,
“we
had
still
best
make
our
plans.”

“Another
day,”
Ned
said.
Perhaps
too
sharply,
from
the
looks
they
gave
him.
He
would
have
to
remember
that
he
was
no
longer
in
Winterfell,
where
only
the
king
stood
higher;
here,
he
was
but
first
among
equals.
“Forgive
me,
my
lords,”
he
said
in
a
softer
tone.
“I
am
tired.
Let
us
call
a
halt
for
today
and
resume
when
we
are
fresher.”
He
did
not
ask
for
their
consent,
but
stood
abruptly,
nodded
at
them
all,
and
made
for
the
door.

Outside,
wagons
and
riders
were
still
pouring
through
the
castle
gates,
and
the
yard
was
a
chaos
of
mud
and
horseflesh
and
shouting
men.
The
king
had
not
yet
arrived,
he
was
told.
Since
the
ugliness
on
the
Trident,
the
Starks
and
their
household
had
ridden
well
ahead
of
the
main
column,
the
better
to
separate
themselves
from
the
Lannisters
and
the
growing
tension.
Robert
had
hardly
been
seen;
the
talk
was
he
was
traveling
in
the
huge
wheelhouse,
drunk
as
often
as
not.
If
so,
he
might
be
hours
behind,
but
he
would
still
be
here
too
soon
for
Ned’s
liking.
He
had
only
to
look
at
Sansa’s
face
to
feel
the
rage
twisting
inside
him
once
again.
The
last
fortnight
of
their
journey
had
been
a
misery.
Sansa
blamed
Arya
and
told
her
that
it
should
have
been
Nymeria
who
died.
And
Arya
was
lost
after
she
heard
what
had
happened
to
her
butcher’s
boy.
Sansa
cried
herself
to
sleep,
Arya
brooded
silently
all
day
long,
and
Eddard
Stark
dreamed
of
a
frozen
hell
reserved
for
the
Starks
of
Winterfell.

He
crossed
the
outer
yard,
passed
under
a
portcullis
into
the
inner
bailey,
and
was
walking
toward
what
he
thought
was
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
when
Littlefinger
appeared
in
front
of
him.
“You’re
going
the
wrong
way,
Stark.
Come
with
me.”

Hesitantly,
Ned
followed.
Littlefinger
led
him
into
a
tower,
down
a
stair,
across
a
small
sunken
courtyard,
and
along
a
deserted
corridor
where
empty
suits
of
armor
stood
sentinel
along
the
walls.
They
were
relics
of
the
Targaryens,
black
steel
with
dragon
scales
cresting
their
helms,
now
dusty
and
forgotten.
“This
is
not
the
way
to
my
chambers,”
Ned
said.

“Did
I
say
it
was?
I’m
leading
you
to
the
dungeons
to
slit
your
throat
and
seal
your
corpse
up
behind
a
wall,”
Littlefinger
replied,
his
voice
dripping
with
sarcasm.
“We
have
no
time
for
this,
Stark.
Your
wife
awaits.”

“What
game
are
you
playing,
Littlefinger?
Catelyn
is
at
Winterfell,
hundreds
of
leagues
from
here.”

“Oh?”
Littlefinger’s
grey-green
eyes
glittered
with
amusement.
“Then
it
appears
someone
has
managed
an
astonishing
impersonation.
For
the
last
time,
come.
Or
don’t
come,
and
I’ll
keep
her
for
myself.”
He
hurried
down
the
steps.

Ned
followed
him
warily,
wondering
if
this
day
would
ever
end.
He
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues,
but
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
they
were
meat
and
mead
to
a
man
like
Littlefinger.

At
the
foot
of
the
steps
was
a
heavy
door
of
oak
and
iron.
Petyr
Baelish
lifted
the
crossbar
and
gestured
Ned
through.
They
stepped
out
into
the
ruddy
glow
of
dusk,
on
a
rocky
bluff
high
above
the
river.
“We’re
outside
the
castle,”
Ned
said.

“You
are
a
hard
man
to
fool,
Stark,”
Littlefinger
said
with
a
smirk.
“Was
it
the
sun
that
gave
it
away,
or
the
sky?
Follow
me.
There
are
niches
cut
in
the
rock.
Try
not
to
fall
to
your
death,
Catelyn
would
never
understand.”
With
that,
he
was
over
the
side
of
the
cliff,
descending
as
quick
as
a
monkey.

Ned
studied
the
rocky
face
of
the
bluff
for
a
moment,
then
followed
more
slowly.
The
niches
were
there,
as
Littlefinger
had
promised,
shallow
cuts
that
would
be
invisible
from
below,
unless
you
knew
just
where
to
look
for
them.
The
river
was
a
long,
dizzying
distance
below.
Ned
kept
his
face
pressed
to
the
rock
and
tried
not
to
look
down
any
more
often
than
he
had
to.

When
at
last
he
reached
the
bottom,
a
narrow,
muddy
trail
along
the
water’s
edge,
Littlefinger
was
lazing
against
a
rock
and
eating
an
apple.
He
was
almost
down
to
the
core.
“You
are
growing
old
and
slow,
Stark,”
he
said,
flipping
the
apple
casually
into
the
rushing
water.
“No
matter,
we
ride
the
rest
of
the
way.”
He
had
two
horses
waiting.
Ned
mounted
up
and
trotted
behind
him,
down
the
trail
and
into
the
city.

Finally
Baelish
drew
rein
in
front
of
a
ramshackle
building,
three
stories,
timbered,
its
windows
bright
with
lamplight
in
the
gathering
dusk.
The
sounds
of
music
and
raucous
laughter
drifted
out
and
floated
over
the
water.
Beside
the
door
swung
an
ornate
oil
lamp
on
a
heavy
chain,
with
a
globe
of
leaded
red
glass.

Ned
Stark
dismounted
in
a
fury.
“A
brothel,”
he
said
as
he
seized
Littlefinger
by
the
shoulder
and
spun
him
around.
“You’ve
brought
me
all
this
way
to
take
me
to
a
brothel.”

“Your
wife
is
inside,”
Littlefinger
said.

It
was
the
final
insult.
“Brandon
was
too
kind
to
you,”
Ned
said
as
he
slammed
the
small
man
back
against
a
wall
and
shoved
his
dagger
up
under
the
little
pointed
chin
beard.

“My
lord,
no,”
an
urgent
voice
called
out.
“He
speaks
the
truth.”
There
were
footsteps
behind
him.

Ned
spun,
knife
in
hand,
as
an
old
white-haired
man
hurried
toward
them.
He
was
dressed
in
brown
roughspun,
and
the
soft
flesh
under
his
chin
wobbled
as
he
ran.
“This
is
no
business
of
yours,”
Ned
began;
then,
suddenly,
the
recognition
came.
He
lowered
the
dagger,
astonished.
“Ser
Rodrik?”

Rodrik
Cassel
nodded.
“Your
lady
awaits
you
upstairs.”

Ned
was
lost.
“Catelyn
is
truly
here?
This
is
not
some
strange
jape
of
Littlefinger’s?”
He
sheathed
his
blade.

“Would
that
it
were,
Stark,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Follow
me,
and
try
to
look
a
shade
more
lecherous
and
a
shade
less
like
the
King’s
Hand.
It
would
not
do
to
have
you
recognized.
Perhaps
you
could
fondle
a
breast
or
two,
just
in
passing.”

They
went
inside,
through
a
crowded
common
room
where
a
fat
woman
was
singing
bawdy
songs
while
pretty
young
girls
in
linen
shifts
and
wisps
of
colored
silk
pressed
themselves
against
their
lovers
and
dandled
on
their
laps.
No
one
paid
Ned
the
least
bit
of
attention.
Ser
Rodrik
waited
below
while
Littlefinger
led
him
up
to
the
third
floor,
along
a
corridor,
and
through
a
door.

Inside,
Catelyn
was
waiting.
She
cried
out
when
she
saw
him,
ran
to
him,
and
embraced
him
fiercely.

“My
lady,”
Ned
whispered
in
wonderment.

“Oh,
very
good,”
said
Littlefinger,
closing
the
door.
“You
recognized
her.”

“I
feared
you’d
never
come,
my
lord,”
she
whispered
against
his
chest.
“Petyr
has
been
bringing
me
reports.
He
told
me
of
your
troubles
with
Arya
and
the
young
prince.
How
are
my
girls?”

“Both
in
mourning,
and
full
of
anger,”
he
told
her.
“Cat,
I
do
not
understand.
What
are
you
doing
in
King’s
Landing?
What’s
happened?”
Ned
asked
his
wife.
“Is
it
Bran?
Is
he…”Dead
was
the
word
that
came
to
his
lips,
but
he
could
not
say
it.

“It
is
Bran,
but
not
as
you
think,”
Catelyn
said.

Ned
was
lost.
“Then
how?
Why
are
you
here,
my
love?
What
is
this
place?”

“Just
what
it
appears,”
Littlefinger
said,
easing
himself
onto
a
window
seat.
“A
brothel.
Can
you
think
of
a
less
likely
place
to
find
a
Catelyn
Tully?”
He
smiled.
“As
it
chances,
I
own
this
particular
establishment,
so
arrangements
were
easily
made.
I
am
most
anxious
to
keep
the
Lannisters
from
learning
that
Cat
is
here
in
King’s
Landing.”

“Why?”
Ned
asked.
He
saw
her
hands
then,
the
awkward
way
she
held
them,
the
raw
red
scars,
the
stiffness
of
the
last
two
fingers
on
her
left.
“You’ve
been
hurt.”
He
took
her
hands
in
his
own,
turned
them
over.
“Gods.
Those
are
deep
cuts…
a
gash
from
a
sword
or…
how
did
this
happen,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
slid
a
dagger
out
from
under
her
cloak
and
placed
it
in
his
hand.
“This
blade
was
sent
to
open
Bran’s
throat
and
spill
his
life’s
blood.”

Ned’s
head
jerked
up.
“But…
who…
why
would…”

She
put
a
finger
to
his
lips.
“Let
me
tell
it
all,
my
love.
It
will
go
faster
that
way.
Listen.”

So
he
listened,
and
she
told
it
all,
from
the
fire
in
the
library
tower
to
Varys
and
the
guardsmen
and
Littlefinger.
And
when
she
was
done,
Eddard
Stark
sat
dazed
beside
the
table,
the
dagger
in
his
hand.
Bran’s
wolf
had
saved
the
boy’s
life,
he
thought
dully.
What
was
it
that
Jon
had
said
when
they
found
the
pups
in
the
snow?
Your
children
were
meant
to
have
these
pups,
my
lord.
And
he
had
killed
Sansa’s,
and
for
what?
Was
it
guilt
he
was
feeling?
Or
fear?
If
the
gods
had
sent
these
wolves,
what
folly
had
he
done?

Painfully,
Ned
forced
his
thoughts
back
to
the
dagger
and
what
it
meant.
“The
Imp’s
dagger,”
he
repeated.
It
made
no
sense.
His
hand
curled
around
the
smooth
dragonbone
hilt,
and
he
slammed
the
blade
into
the
table,
felt
it
bite
into
the
wood.
It
stood
mocking
him.
“Why
should
Tyrion
Lannister
want
Bran
dead?
The
boy
has
never
done
him
harm.”

“Do
you
Starks
have
nought
but
snow
between
your
ears?”
Littlefinger
asked.
“The
Imp
would
never
have
acted
alone.”

Ned
rose
and
paced
the
length
of
the
room.
“If
the
queen
had
a
role
in
this
or,
gods
forbid,
the
king
himself…
no,
I
will
not
believe
that.”
Yet
even
as
he
said
the
words,
he
remembered
that
chill
morning
on
the
barrowlands,
and
Robert’s
talk
of
sending
hired
knives
after
the
Targaryen
princess.
He
remembered
Rhaegar’s
infant
son,
the
red
ruin
of
his
skull,
and
the
way
the
king
had
turned
away,
as
he
had
turned
away
in
Darry’s
audience
hall
not
so
long
ago.
He
could
still
hear
Sansa
pleading,
as
Lyanna
had
pleaded
once.

“Most
likely
the
king
did
not
know,”
Littlefinger
said.
“It
would
not
be
the
first
time.
Our
good
Robert
is
practiced
at
closing
his
eyes
to
things
he
would
rather
not
see.”

Ned
had
no
reply
for
that.
The
face
of
the
butcher’s
boy
swam
up
before
his
eyes,
cloven
almost
in
two,
and
afterward
the
king
had
said
not
a
word.
His
head
was
pounding.

Littlefinger
sauntered
over
to
the
table,
wrenched
the
knife
from
the
wood.
“The
accusation
is
treason
either
way.
Accuse
the
king
and
you
will
dance
with
Ilyn
Payne
before
the
words
are
out
of
your
mouth.
The
queen…
if
you
can
find
proof,
and
if
you
can
make
Robert
listen,
then
perhaps…”

“We
have
proof,”
Ned
said.
“We
have
the
dagger.”

“This?”
Littlefinger
flipped
the
knife
casually
end
over
end.
“A
sweet
piece
of
steel,
but
it
cuts
two
ways,
my
lord.
The
Imp
will
no
doubt
swear
the
blade
was
lost
or
stolen
while
he
was
at
Winterfell,
and
with
his
hireling
dead,
who
is
there
to
give
him
the
lie?”
He
tossed
the
knife
lightly
to
Ned.
“My
counsel
is
to
drop
that
in
the
river
and
forget
that
it
was
ever
forged.”

Ned
regarded
him
coldly.
“Lord
Baelish,
I
am
a
Stark
of
Winterfell.
My
son
lies
crippled,
perhaps
dying.
He
would
be
dead,
and
Catelyn
with
him,
but
for
a
wolf
pup
we
found
in
the
snow.
If
you
truly
believe
I
could
forget
that,
you
are
as
big
a
fool
now
as
when
you
took
up
sword
against
my
brother.”

“A
fool
I
may
be,
Stark…
yet
I’m
still
here,
while
your
brother
has
been
moldering
in
his
frozen
grave
for
some
fourteen
years
now.
If
you
are
so
eager
to
molder
beside
him,
far
be
it
from
me
to
dissuade
you,
but
I
would
rather
not
be
included
in
the
party,
thank
you
very
much.”

“You
would
be
the
last
man
I
would
willingly
include
in
any
party,
Lord
Baelish.”

“You
wound
me
deeply.”
Littlefinger
placed
a
hand
over
his
heart.
“For
my
part,
I
always
found
you
Starks
a
tiresome
lot,
but
Cat
seems
to
have
become
attached
to
you,
for
reasons
I
cannot
comprehend.
I
shall
try
to
keep
you
alive
for
her
sake.
A
fool’s
task,
admittedly,
but
I
could
never
refuse
your
wife
anything.”

“I
told
Petyr
our
suspicions
about
Jon
Arryn’s
death,”
Catelyn
said.
“He
has
promised
to
help
you
find
the
truth.”

That
was
not
news
that
Eddard
Stark
welcomed,
but
it
was
true
enough
that
they
needed
help,
and
Littlefinger
had
been
almost
a
brother
to
Cat
once.
It
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
Ned
had
been
forced
to
make
common
cause
with
a
man
he
despised.
“Very
well,”
he
said,
thrusting
the
dagger
into
his
belt.
“You
spoke
of
Varys.
Does
the
eunuch
know
all
of
it?”

“Not
from
my
lips,”
Catelyn
said.
“You
did
not
wed
a
fool,
Eddard
Stark.
But
Varys
has
ways
of
learning
things
that
no
man
could
know.
He
has
some
dark
art,
Ned,
I
swear
it.”

“He
has
spies,
that
is
well
known,”
Ned
said,
dismissive.

“It
is
more
than
that,”
Catelyn
insisted.
“Ser
Rodrik
spoke
to
Ser
Aron
Santagar
in
all
secrecy,
yet
somehow
the
Spider
knew
of
their
conversation.
I
fear
that
man.”

Littlefinger
smiled.
“Leave
Lord
Varys
to
me,
sweet
lady.
If
you
will
permit
me
a
small
obscenity—and
where
better
for
it—I
hold
the
man’s
balls
in
the
palm
of
my
hand.”
He
cupped
his
fingers,
smiling.
“Or
would,
if
he
were
a
man,
or
had
any
balls.
You
see,
if
the
pie
is
opened,
the
birds
begin
to
sing,
and
Varys
would
not
like
that.
Were
I
you,
I
would
worry
more
about
the
Lannisters
and
less
about
the
eunuch.”

Ned
did
not
need
Littlefinger
to
tell
him
that.
He
was
thinking
back
to
the
day
Arya
had
been
found,
to
the
look
on
the
queen’s
face
when
she
said,
We
have
a
wolf,
so
soft
and
quiet.
He
was
thinking
of
the
boy
Mycah,
of
Jon
Arryn’s
sudden
death,
of
Bran’s
fall,
of
old
mad
Aerys
Targaryen
dying
on
the
floor
of
his
throne
room
while
his
life’s
blood
dried
on
a
golden
blade.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
turning
to
Catelyn,
“there
is
nothing
more
you
can
do
here.
I
want
you
to
return
to
Winterfell
at
once.
If
there
was
one
assassin,
there
could
be
others.
Whoever
ordered
Bran’s
death
will
learn
soon
enough
that
the
boy
still
lives.”

“I
had
hoped
to
see
the
girls…”
Catelyn
said.

“That
would
be
most
unwise,”
Littlefinger
put
in.
“The
Red
Keep
is
full
of
curious
eyes,
and
children
talk.”

“He
speaks
truly,
my
love,”
Ned
told
her.
He
embraced
her.
“Take
Ser
Rodrik
and
ride
for
Winterfell.
I
will
watch
over
the
girls.
Go
home
to
our
sons
and
keep
them
safe.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Catelyn
lifted
her
face,
and
Ned
kissed
her.
Her
maimed
fingers
clutched
against
his
back
with
a
desperate
strength,
as
if
to
hold
him
safe
forever
in
the
shelter
of
her
arms.

“Would
the
lord
and
lady
like
the
use
of
a
bedchamber?”
asked
Littlefinger.
“I
should
warn
you,
Stark,
we
usually
charge
for
that
sort
of
thing
around
here.”

“A
moment
alone,
that’s
all
I
ask,”
Catelyn
said.

“Very
well.”
Littlefinger
strolled
to
the
door.
“Don’t
be
too
long.
It
is
past
time
the
Hand
and
I
returned
to
the
castle,
before
our
absence
is
noted.”

Catelyn
went
to
him
and
took
his
hands
in
her
own.
“I
will
not
forget
the
help
you
gave
me,
Petyr.
When
your
men
came
for
me,
I
did
not
know
whether
they
were
taking
me
to
a
friend
or
an
enemy.
I
have
found
you
more
than
a
friend.
I
have
found
a
brother
I’d
thought
lost.”

Petyr
Baelish
smiled.
“I
am
desperately
sentimental,
sweet
lady.
Best
not
tell
anyone.
I
have
spent
years
convincing
the
court
that
I
am
wicked
and
cruel,
and
I
should
hate
to
see
all
that
hard
work
go
for
naught.”

Ned
believed
not
a
word
of
that,
but
he
kept
his
voice
polite
as
he
said,
“You
have
my
thanks
as
well,
Lord
Baelish.”

“Oh,
now
there’s
a
treasure,”
Littlefinger
said,
exiting.

When
the
door
had
closed
behind
him,
Ned
turned
back
to
his
wife.
“Once
you
are
home,
send
word
to
Helman
Tallhart
and
Galbart
Glover
under
my
seal.
They
are
to
raise
a
hundred
bowmen
each
and
fortify
Moat
Cailin.
Two
hundred
determined
archers
can
hold
the
Neck
against
an
army.
Instruct
Lord
Manderly
that
he
is
to
strengthen
and
repair
all
his
defenses
at
White
Harbor,
and
see
that
they
are
well
manned.
And
from
this
day
on,
I
want
a
careful
watch
kept
over
Theon
Greyjoy.
If
there
is
war,
we
shall
have
sore
need
of
his
father’s
fleet.”

“War?”
The
fear
was
plain
on
Catelyn’s
face.

“It
will
not
come
to
that,”
Ned
promised
her,
praying
it
was
true.
He
took
her
in
his
arms
again.
“The
Lannisters
are
merciless
in
the
face
of
weakness,
as
Aerys
Targaryen
learned
to
his
sorrow,
but
they
would
not
dare
attack
the
north
without
all
the
power
of
the
realm
behind
them,
and
that
they
shall
not
have.
I
must
play
out
this
fool’s
masquerade
as
if
nothing
is
amiss.
Remember
why
I
came
here,
my
love.
If
I
find
proof
that
the
Lannisters
murdered
Jon
Arryn…”

He
felt
Catelyn
tremble
in
his
arms.
Her
scarred
hands
clung
to
him.
“If,”
she
said,
“what
then,
my
love?”

That
was
the
most
dangerous
part,
Ned
knew.
“All
justice
flows
from
the
king,”
he
told
her.
“When
I
know
the
truth,
I
must
go
to
Robert.”
And
pray
that
he
is
the
man
I
think
he
is,
he
finished
silently,
and
not
the
man
I
fear
he
has
become.





TYRION

“Are
you
certain
that
you
must
leave
us
so
soon?”
the
Lord
Commander
asked
him.

“Past
certain,
Lord
Mormont,”
Tyrion
replied.
“My
brother
Jaime
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me.
He
may
decide
that
you
have
convinced
me
to
take
the
black.”

“Would
that
I
could.”
Mormont
picked
up
a
crab
claw
and
cracked
it
in
his
fist.
Old
as
he
was,
the
Lord
Commander
still
had
the
strength
of
a
bear.
“You’re
a
cunning
man,
Tyrion.
We
have
need
of
men
of
your
sort
on
the
Wall.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“Then
I
shall
scour
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
dwarfs
and
ship
them
all
to
you,
Lord
Mormont.”
As
they
laughed,
he
sucked
the
meat
from
a
crab
leg
and
reached
for
another.
The
crabs
had
arrived
from
Eastwatch
only
this
morning,
packed
in
a
barrel
of
snow,
and
they
were
succulent.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
the
only
man
at
table
who
did
not
so
much
as
crack
a
smile.
“Lannister
mocks
us.”

“Only
you,
Ser
Alliser,”
Tyrion
said.
This
time
the
laughter
round
the
table
had
a
nervous,
uncertain
quality
to
it.

Thorne’s
black
eyes
fixed
on
Tyrion
with
loathing.
“You
have
a
bold
tongue
for
someone
who
is
less
than
half
a
man.
Perhaps
you
and
I
should
visit
the
yard
together.”

“Why?”
asked
Tyrion.
“The
crabs
are
here.”

The
remark
brought
more
guffaws
from
the
others.
Ser
Alliser
stood
up,
his
mouth
a
tight
line.
“Come
and
make
your
japes
with
steel
in
your
hand.”

Tyrion
looked
pointedly
at
his
right
hand.
“Why,
I
have
steel
in
my
hand,
Ser
Alliser,
although
it
appears
to
be
a
crab
fork.
Shall
we
duel?”
He
hopped
up
on
his
chair
and
began
poking
at
Thorne’s
chest
with
the
tiny
fork.
Roars
of
laughter
filled
the
tower
room.
Bits
of
crab
flew
from
the
Lord
Commander’s
mouth
as
he
began
to
gasp
and
choke.
Even
his
raven
joined
in,
cawing
loudly
from
above
the
window.
“Duel!
Duel!
Duel!”

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
walked
from
the
room
so
stiffly
it
looked
as
though
he
had
a
dagger
up
his
butt.

Mormont
was
still
gasping
for
breath.
Tyrion
pounded
him
on
the
back.
“To
the
victor
goes
the
spoils,”
he
called
out.
“I
claim
Thorne’s
share
of
the
crabs.”

Finally
the
Lord
Commander
recovered
himself.
“You
are
a
wicked
man,
to
provoke
our
Ser
Alliser
so,”
he
scolded.

Tyrion
seated
himself
and
took
a
sip
of
wine.
“If
a
man
paints
a
target
on
his
chest,
he
should
expect
that
sooner
or
later
someone
will
loose
an
arrow
at
him.
I
have
seen
dead
men
with
more
humor
than
your
Ser
Alliser.”

“Not
so,”
objected
the
Lord
Steward,
Bowen
Marsh,
a
man
as
round
and
red
as
a
pomegranate.
“You
ought
to
hear
the
droll
names
he
gives
the
lads
he
trains.”

Tyrion
had
heard
a
few
of
those
droll
names.
“I’ll
wager
the
lads
have
a
few
names
for
him
as
well,”
he
said.
“Chip
the
ice
off
your
eyes,
my
good
lords.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
should
be
mucking
out
your
stables,
not
drilling
your
young
warriors.”

“The
Watch
has
no
shortage
of
stableboys,”
Lord
Mormont
grumbled.
“That
seems
to
be
all
they
send
us
these
days.
Stableboys
and
sneak
thieves
and
rapers.
Ser
Alliser
is
an
anointed
knight,
one
of
the
few
to
take
the
black
since
I
have
been
Lord
Commander.
He
fought
bravely
at
King’s
Landing.”

“On
the
wrong
side,”
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
commented
dryly.
“I
ought
to
know,
I
was
there
on
the
battlements
beside
him.
Tywin
Lannister
gave
us
a
splendid
choice.
Take
the
black,
or
see
our
heads
on
spikes
before
evenfall.
No
offense
intended,
Tyrion.”

“None
taken,
Ser
Jaremy.
My
father
is
very
fond
of
spiked
heads,
especially
those
of
people
who
have
annoyed
him
in
some
fashion.
And
a
face
as
noble
as
yours,
well,
no
doubt
he
saw
you
decorating
the
city
wall
above
the
King’s
Gate.
I
think
you
would
have
looked
very
striking
up
there.”

“Thank
you,”
Ser
Jaremy
replied
with
a
sardonic
smile.

Lord
Commander
Mormont
cleared
his
throat.
“Sometimes
I
fear
Ser
Alliser
saw
you
true,
Tyrion.
You
do
mock
us
and
our
noble
purpose
here.”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“We
all
need
to
be
mocked
from
time
to
time,
Lord
Mormont,
lest
we
start
to
take
ourselves
too
seriously.
More
wine,
please.”
He
held
out
his
cup.

As
Rykker
filled
it
for
him,
Bowen
Marsh
said,
“You
have
a
great
thirst
for
a
small
man.”

“Oh,
I
think
that
Lord
Tyrion
is
quite
a
large
man,”
Maester
Aemon
said
from
the
far
end
of
the
table.
He
spoke
softly,
yet
the
high
officers
of
the
Night’s
Watch
all
fell
quiet,
the
better
to
hear
what
the
ancient
had
to
say.
“I
think
he
is
a
giant
come
among
us,
here
at
the
end
of
the
world.”

Tyrion
answered
gently,
“I’ve
been
called
many
things,
my
lord,
but
giant
is
seldom
one
of
them.”

“Nonetheless,”
Maester
Aemon
said
as
his
clouded,
milk-white
eyes
moved
to
Tyrion’s
face,
“I
think
it
is
true.”

For
once,
Tyrion
Lannister
found
himself
at
a
loss
for
words.
He
could
only
bow
his
head
politely
and
say,
“You
are
too
kind,
Maester
Aemon.”

The
blind
man
smiled.
He
was
a
tiny
thing,
wrinkled
and
hairless,
shrunken
beneath
the
weight
of
a
hundred
years
so
his
maester’s
collar
with
its
links
of
many
metals
hung
loose
about
his
throat.
“I
have
been
called
many
things,
my
lord,”
he
said,
“but
kind
is
seldom
one
of
them.”
This
time
Tyrion
himself
led
the
laughter.

Much
later,
when
the
serious
business
of
eating
was
done
and
the
others
had
left,
Mormont
offered
Tyrion
a
chair
beside
the
fire
and
a
cup
of
mulled
spirits
so
strong
they
brought
tears
to
his
eyes.
“The
kingsroad
can
be
perilous
this
far
north,”
the
Lord
Commander
told
him
as
they
drank.

“I
have
Jyck
and
Morrec,”
Tyrion
said,
“and
Yoren
is
riding
south
again.”

“Yoren
is
only
one
man.
The
Watch
shall
escort
you
as
far
as
Winterfell,”
Mormont
announced
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
argument.
“Three
men
should
be
sufficient.”

“If
you
insist,
my
lord,”
Tyrion
said.
“You
might
send
young
Snow.
He
would
be
glad
for
a
chance
to
see
his
brothers.”

Mormont
frowned
through
his
thick
grey
beard.
“Snow?
Oh,
the
Stark
bastard.
I
think
not.
The
young
ones
need
to
forget
the
lives
they
left
behind
them,
the
brothers
and
mothers
and
all
that.
A
visit
home
would
only
stir
up
feelings
best
left
alone.
I
know
these
things.
My
own
blood
kin…
my
sister
Maege
rules
Bear
Island
now,
since
my
son’s
dishonor.
I
have
nieces
I
have
never
seen.”
He
took
a
swallow.
“Besides,
Jon
Snow
is
only
a
boy.
You
shall
have
three
strong
swords,
to
keep
you
safe.”

“I
am
touched
by
your
concern,
Lord
Mormont.”
The
strong
drink
was
making
Tyrion
light-headed,
but
not
so
drunk
that
he
did
not
realize
that
the
Old
Bear
wanted
something
from
him.
“I
hope
I
can
repay
your
kindness.”

“You
can,”
Mormont
said
bluntly.
“Your
sister
sits
beside
the
king.
Your
brother
is
a
great
knight,
and
your
father
the
most
powerful
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Speak
to
them
for
us.
Tell
them
of
our
need
here.
You
have
seen
for
yourself,
my
lord.
The
Night’s
Watch
is
dying.
Our
strength
is
less
than
a
thousand
now.
Six
hundred
here,
two
hundred
in
the
Shadow
Tower,
even
fewer
at
Eastwatch,
and
a
scant
third
of
those
fighting
men.
The
Wall
is
a
hundred
leagues
long.
Think
on
that.
Should
an
attack
come,
I
have
three
men
to
defend
each
mile
of
wall.”

“Three
and
a
third,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
yawn.

Mormont
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
him.
The
old
man
warmed
his
hands
before
the
fire.
“I
sent
Benjen
Stark
to
search
after
Yohn
Royce’s
son,
lost
on
his
first
ranging.
The
Royce
boy
was
green
as
summer
grass,
yet
he
insisted
on
the
honor
of
his
own
command,
saying
it
was
his
due
as
a
knight.
I
did
not
wish
to
offend
his
lord
father,
so
I
yielded.
I
sent
him
out
with
two
men
I
deemed
as
good
as
any
in
the
Watch.
More
fool
I.”

“Fool,”
the
raven
agreed.
Tyrion
glanced
up.
The
bird
peered
down
at
him
with
those
beady
black
eyes,
ruffling
its
wings.
“Fool,”
it
called
again.
Doubtless
old
Mormont
would
take
it
amiss
if
he
throttled
the
creature.
A
pity.

The
Lord
Commander
took
no
notice
of
the
irritating
bird.
“Gared
was
near
as
old
as
I
am
and
longer
on
the
Wall,”
he
went
on,
“yet
it
would
seem
he
forswore
himself
and
fled.
I
should
never
have
believed
it,
not
of
him,
but
Lord
Eddard
sent
me
his
head
from
Winterfell.
Of
Royce,
there
is
no
word.
One
deserter
and
two
men
lost,
and
now
Ben
Stark
too
has
gone
missing.”
He
sighed
deeply.
“Who
am
I
to
send
searching
after
him?
In
two
years
I
will
be
seventy.
Too
old
and
too
weary
for
the
burden
I
bear,
yet
if
I
set
it
down,
who
will
pick
it
up?
Alliser
Thorne?
Bowen
Marsh?
I
would
have
to
be
as
blind
as
Maester
Aemon
not
to
see
what
they
are.
The
Night’s
Watch
has
become
an
army
of
sullen
boys
and
tired
old
men.
Apart
from
the
men
at
my
table
tonight,
I
have
perhaps
twenty
who
can
read,
and
even
fewer
who
can
think,
or
plan,
or
lead.
Once
the
Watch
spent
its
summers
building,
and
each
Lord
Commander
raised
the
Wall
higher
than
he
found
it.
Now
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
stay
alive.”

He
was
in
deadly
earnest,
Tyrion
realized.
He
felt
faintly
embarrassed
for
the
old
man.
Lord
Mormont
had
spent
a
good
part
of
his
life
on
the
Wall,
and
he
needed
to
believe
if
those
years
were
to
have
any
meaning.
“I
promise,
the
king
will
hear
of
your
need,”
Tyrion
said
gravely,
“and
I
will
speak
to
my
father
and
my
brother
Jaime
as
well.”
And
he
would.
Tyrion
Lannister
was
as
good
as
his
word.
He
left
the
rest
unsaid;
that
King
Robert
would
ignore
him,
Lord
Tywin
would
ask
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses,
and
Jaime
would
only
laugh.

“You
are
a
young
man,
Tyrion,”
Mormont
said.
“How
many
winters
have
you
seen?”

He
shrugged.
“Eight,
nine.
I
misremember.”

“And
all
of
them
short.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
He
had
been
born
in
the
dead
of
winter,
a
terrible
cruel
one
that
the
maesters
said
had
lasted
near
three
years,
but
Tyrion’s
earliest
memories
were
of
spring.

“When
I
was
a
boy,
it
was
said
that
a
long
summer
always
meant
a
long
winter
to
come.
This
summer
has
lasted
nine
years,
Tyrion,
and
a
tenth
will
soon
be
upon
us.
Think
on
that.”

“When
I
was
a
boy,”
Tyrion
replied,
“my
wet
nurse
told
me
that
one
day,
if
men
were
good,
the
gods
would
give
the
world
a
summer
without
ending.
Perhaps
we’ve
been
better
than
we
thought,
and
the
Great
Summer
is
finally
at
hand.”
He
grinned.

The
Lord
Commander
did
not
seem
amused.
“You
are
not
fool
enough
to
believe
that,
my
lord.
Already
the
days
grow
shorter.
There
can
be
no
mistake,
Aemon
has
had
letters
from
the
Citadel,
findings
in
accord
with
his
own.
The
end
of
summer
stares
us
in
the
face.”
Mormont
reached
out
and
clutched
Tyrion
tightly
by
the
hand.
“You
must
make
them
understand.
I
tell
you,
my
lord,
the
darkness
is
coming.
There
are
wild
things
in
the
woods,
direwolves
and
mammoths
and
snow
bears
the
size
of
aurochs,
and
I
have
seen
darker
shapes
in
my
dreams.”

“In
your
dreams,”
Tyrion
echoed,
thinking
how
badly
he
needed
another
strong
drink.

Mormont
was
deaf
to
the
edge
in
his
voice.
“The
fisherfolk
near
Eastwatch
have
glimpsed
white
walkers
on
the
shore.”

This
time
Tyrion
could
not
hold
his
tongue.
“The
fisherfolk
of
Lannisport
often
glimpse
merlings.”

“Denys
Mallister
writes
that
the
mountain
people
are
moving
south,
slipping
past
the
Shadow
Tower
in
numbers
greater
than
ever
before.
They
are
running,
my
lord…
but
running
from
what?”
Lord
Mormont
moved
to
the
window
and
stared
out
into
the
night.
“These
are
old
bones,
Lannister,
but
they
have
never
felt
a
chill
like
this.
Tell
the
king
what
I
say,
I
pray
you.
Winter
is
coming,
and
when
the
Long
Night
falls,
only
the
Night’s
Watch
will
stand
between
the
realm
and
the
darkness
that
sweeps
from
the
north.
The
gods
help
us
all
if
we
are
not
ready.”

“The
gods
help
me
if
I
do
not
get
some
sleep
tonight.
Yoren
is
determined
to
ride
at
first
light.”
Tyrion
got
to
his
feet,
sleepy
from
wine
and
tired
of
doom.
“I
thank
you
for
all
the
courtesies
you
have
done
me,
Lord
Mormont.”

“Tell
them,
Tyrion.
Tell
them
and
make
them
believe.
That
is
all
the
thanks
I
need.”
He
whistled,
and
his
raven
flew
to
him
and
perched
on
his
shoulder.
Mormont
smiled
and
gave
the
bird
some
corn
from
his
pocket,
and
that
was
how
Tyrion
left
him.

It
was
bitter
cold
outside.
Bundled
thickly
in
his
furs,
Tyrion
Lannister
pulled
on
his
gloves
and
nodded
to
the
poor
frozen
wretches
standing
sentry
outside
the
Commander’s
Keep.
He
set
off
across
the
yard
for
his
own
chambers
in
the
King’s
Tower,
walking
as
briskly
as
his
legs
could
manage.
Patches
of
snow
crunched
beneath
his
feet
as
his
boots
broke
the
night’s
crust,
and
his
breath
steamed
before
him
like
a
banner.
He
shoved
his
hands
into
his
armpits
and
walked
faster,
praying
that
Morrec
had
remembered
to
warm
his
bed
with
hot
bricks
from
the
fire.

Behind
the
King’s
Tower,
the
Wall
glimmered
in
the
light
of
the
moon,
immense
and
mysterious.
Tyrion
stopped
for
a
moment
to
look
up
at
it.
His
legs
ached
of
cold
and
haste.

Suddenly
a
strange
madness
took
hold
of
him,
a
yearning
to
look
once
more
off
the
end
of
the
world.
It
would
be
his
last
chance,
he
thought;
tomorrow
he
would
ride
south,
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
would
ever
want
to
return
to
this
frozen
desolation.
The
King’s
Tower
was
before
him,
with
its
promise
of
warmth
and
a
soft
bed,
yet
Tyrion
found
himself
walking
past
it,
toward
the
vast
pale
palisade
of
the
Wall.

A
wooden
stair
ascended
the
south
face,
anchored
on
huge
rough-hewn
beams
sunk
deep
into
the
ice
and
frozen
in
place.
Back
and
forth
it
switched,
clawing
its
way
upward
as
crooked
as
a
bolt
of
lightning.
The
black
brothers
assured
him
that
it
was
much
stronger
than
it
looked,
but
Tyrion’s
legs
were
cramping
too
badly
for
him
to
even
contemplate
the
ascent.
He
went
instead
to
the
iron
cage
beside
the
well,
clambered
inside,
and
yanked
hard
on
the
bell
rope,
three
quick
pulls.

He
had
to
wait
what
seemed
an
eternity,
standing
there
inside
the
bars
with
the
Wall
to
his
back.
Long
enough
for
Tyrion
to
begin
to
wonder
why
he
was
doing
this.
He
had
just
about
decided
to
forget
his
sudden
whim
and
go
to
bed
when
the
cage
gave
a
jerk
and
began
to
ascend.

He
moved
upward
slowly,
by
fits
and
starts
at
first,
then
more
smoothly.
The
ground
fell
away
beneath
him,
the
cage
swung,
and
Tyrion
wrapped
his
hands
around
the
iron
bars.
He
could
feel
the
cold
of
the
metal
even
through
his
gloves.
Morrec
had
a
fire
burning
in
his
room,
he
noted
with
approval,
but
the
Lord
Commander’s
tower
was
dark.
The
Old
Bear
had
more
sense
than
he
did,
it
seemed.

Then
he
was
above
the
towers,
still
inching
his
way
upward.
Castle
Black
lay
below
him,
etched
in
moonlight.
You
could
see
how
stark
and
empty
it
was
from
up
here;
windowless
keeps,
crumbling
walls,
courtyards
choked
with
broken
stone.
Farther
off,
he
could
see
the
lights
of
Mole’s
Town,
the
little
village
half
a
league
south
along
the
kingsroad,
and
here
and
there
the
bright
glitter
of
moonlight
on
water
where
icy
streams
descended
from
the
mountain
heights
to
cut
across
the
plains.
The
rest
of
the
world
was
a
bleak
emptiness
of
windswept
hills
and
rocky
fields
spotted
with
snow.

Finally
a
thick
voice
behind
him
said,
“Seven
hells,
it’s
the
dwarf,”
and
the
cage
jerked
to
a
sudden
stop
and
hung
there,
swinging
slowly
back
and
forth,
the
ropes
creaking.

“Bring
him
in,
damn
it.”
There
was
a
grunt
and
a
loud
groaning
of
wood
as
the
cage
slid
sideways
and
then
the
Wall
was
beneath
him.
Tyrion
waited
until
the
swinging
had
stopped
before
he
pushed
open
the
cage
door
and
hopped
down
onto
the
ice.
A
heavy
figure
in
black
was
leaning
on
the
winch,
while
a
second
held
the
cage
with
a
gloved
hand.
Their
faces
were
muffled
in
woolen
scarves
so
only
their
eyes
showed,
and
they
were
plump
with
layers
of
wool
and
leather,
black
on
black.
“And
what
will
you
be
wanting,
this
time
of
night?”
the
one
by
the
winch
asked.

“A
last
look.”

The
men
exchanged
sour
glances.
“Look
all
you
want,”
the
other
one
said.
“Just
have
a
care
you
don’t
fall
off,
little
man.
The
Old
Bear
would
have
our
hides.”
A
small
wooden
shack
stood
under
the
great
crane,
and
Tyrion
saw
the
dull
glow
of
a
brazier
and
felt
a
brief
gust
of
warmth
when
the
winch
men
opened
the
door
and
went
back
inside.
And
then
he
was
alone.

It
was
bitingly
cold
up
here,
and
the
wind
pulled
at
his
clothes
like
an
insistent
lover.
The
top
of
the
Wall
was
wider
than
the
kingsroad
often
was,
so
Tyrion
had
no
fear
of
falling,
although
the
footing
was
slicker
than
he
would
have
liked.
The
brothers
spread
crushed
stone
across
the
walkways,
but
the
weight
of
countless
footsteps
would
melt
the
Wall
beneath,
so
the
ice
would
seem
to
grow
around
the
gravel,
swallowing
it,
until
the
path
was
bare
again
and
it
was
time
to
crush
more
stone.

Still,
it
was
nothing
that
Tyrion
could
not
manage.
He
looked
off
to
the
east
and
west,
at
the
Wall
stretching
before
him,
a
vast
white
road
with
no
beginning
and
no
end
and
a
dark
abyss
on
either
side.
West,
he
decided,
for
no
special
reason,
and
he
began
to
walk
that
way,
following
the
pathway
nearest
the
north
edge,
where
the
gravel
looked
freshest.

His
bare
cheeks
were
ruddy
with
the
cold,
and
his
legs
complained
more
loudly
with
every
step,
but
Tyrion
ignored
them.
The
wind
swirled
around
him,
gravel
crunched
beneath
his
boots,
while
ahead
the
white
ribbon
followed
the
lines
of
the
hills,
rising
higher
and
higher,
until
it
was
lost
beyond
the
western
horizon.
He
passed
a
massive
catapult,
as
tall
as
a
city
wall,
its
base
sunk
deep
into
the
Wall.
The
throwing
arm
had
been
taken
off
for
repairs
and
then
forgotten;
it
lay
there
like
a
broken
toy,
half-embedded
in
the
ice.

On
the
far
side
of
the
catapult,
a
muffled
voice
called
out
a
challenge.
“Who
goes
there?
Halt!”

Tyrion
stopped.
“If
I
halt
too
long
I’ll
freeze
in
place,
Jon,”
he
said
as
a
shaggy
pale
shape
slid
toward
him
silently
and
sniffed
at
his
furs.
“Hello,
Ghost.”

Jon
Snow
moved
closer.
He
looked
bigger
and
heavier
in
his
layers
of
fur
and
leather,
the
hood
of
his
cloak
pulled
down
over
his
face.
“Lannister,”
he
said,
yanking
loose
the
scarf
to
uncover
his
mouth.
“This
is
the
last
place
I
would
have
expected
to
see
you.”
He
carried
a
heavy
spear
tipped
in
iron,
taller
than
he
was,
and
a
sword
hung
at
his
side
in
a
leather
sheath.
Across
his
chest
was
a
gleaming
black
warhorn,
banded
with
silver.

“This
is
the
last
place
I
would
have
expected
to
be
seen,”
Tyrion
admitted.
“I
was
captured
by
a
whim.
If
I
touch
Ghost,
will
he
chew
my
hand
off?”

“Not
with
me
here,”
Jon
promised.

Tyrion
scratched
the
white
wolf
behind
the
ears.
The
red
eyes
watched
him
impassively.
The
beast
came
up
as
high
as
his
chest
now.
Another
year,
and
Tyrion
had
the
gloomy
feeling
he’d
be
looking
up
at
him.
“What
are
you
doing
up
here
tonight?”
he
asked.
“Besides
freezing
your
manhood
off…”

“I
have
drawn
night
guard,”
Jon
said.
“Again.
Ser
Alliser
has
kindly
arranged
for
the
watch
commander
to
take
a
special
interest
in
me.
He
seems
to
think
that
if
they
keep
me
awake
half
the
night,
I’ll
fall
asleep
during
morning
drill.
So
far
I
have
disappointed
him.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“And
has
Ghost
learned
to
juggle
yet?”

“No,”
said
Jon,
smiling,
“but
Grenn
held
his
own
against
Halder
this
morning,
and
Pyp
is
no
longer
dropping
his
sword
quite
so
often
as
he
did.”

“Pyp?”

“Pypar
is
his
real
name.
The
small
boy
with
the
large
ears.
He
saw
me
working
with
Grenn
and
asked
for
help.
Thorne
had
never
even
shown
him
the
proper
way
to
grip
a
sword.”
He
turned
to
look
north.
“I
have
a
mile
of
Wall
to
guard.
Will
you
walk
with
me?”

“If
you
walk
slowly,”
Tyrion
said.

“The
watch
commander
tells
me
I
must
walk,
to
keep
my
blood
from
freezing,
but
he
never
said
how
fast.”

They
walked,
with
Ghost
pacing
along
beside
Jon
like
a
white
shadow.
“I
leave
on
the
morrow,”
Tyrion
said.

“I
know.”
Jon
sounded
strangely
sad.

“I
plan
to
stop
at
Winterfell
on
the
way
south.
If
there
is
any
message
that
you
would
like
me
to
deliver…”

“Tell
Robb
that
I’m
going
to
command
the
Night’s
Watch
and
keep
him
safe,
so
he
might
as
well
take
up
needlework
with
the
girls
and
have
Mikken
melt
down
his
sword
for
horseshoes.”

“Your
brother
is
bigger
than
me,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
laugh.
“I
decline
to
deliver
any
message
that
might
get
me
killed.”

“Rickon
will
ask
when
I’m
coming
home.
Try
to
explain
where
I’ve
gone,
if
you
can.
Tell
him
he
can
have
all
my
things
while
I’m
away,
he’ll
like
that.”

People
seemed
to
be
asking
a
great
deal
of
him
today,
Tyrion
Lannister
thought.
“You
could
put
all
this
in
a
letter,
you
know.”

“Rickon
can’t
read
yet.
Bran…”
He
stopped
suddenly.
“I
don’t
know
what
message
to
send
to
Bran.
Help
him,
Tyrion.”

“What
help
could
I
give
him?
I
am
no
maester,
to
ease
his
pain.
I
have
no
spells
to
give
him
back
his
legs.”

“You
gave
me
help
when
I
needed
it,”
Jon
Snow
said.

“I
gave
you
nothing,”
Tyrion
said.
“Words.”

“Then
give
your
words
to
Bran
too.”

“You’re
asking
a
lame
man
to
teach
a
cripple
how
to
dance,”
Tyrion
said.
“However
sincere
the
lesson,
the
result
is
likely
to
be
grotesque.
Still,
I
know
what
it
is
to
love
a
brother,
Lord
Snow.
I
will
give
Bran
whatever
small
help
is
in
my
power.”

“Thank
you,
my
lord
of
Lannister.”
He
pulled
off
his
glove
and
offered
his
bare
hand.
“Friend.”

Tyrion
found
himself
oddly
touched.
“Most
of
my
kin
are
bastards,”
he
said
with
a
wry
smile,
“but
you’re
the
first
I’ve
had
to
friend.”
He
pulled
a
glove
off
with
his
teeth
and
clasped
Snow
by
the
hand,
flesh
against
flesh.
The
boy’s
grip
was
firm
and
strong.

When
he
had
donned
his
glove
again,
Jon
Snow
turned
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
low,
icy
northern
parapet.
Beyond
him
the
Wall
fell
away
sharply;
beyond
him
there
was
only
the
darkness
and
the
wild.
Tyrion
followed
him,
and
side
by
side
they
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
world.

The
Night’s
Watch
permitted
the
forest
to
come
no
closer
than
half
a
mile
of
the
north
face
of
the
Wall.
The
thickets
of
ironwood
and
sentinel
and
oak
that
had
once
grown
there
had
been
harvested
centuries
ago,
to
create
a
broad
swath
of
open
ground
through
which
no
enemy
could
hope
to
pass
unseen.
Tyrion
had
heard
that
elsewhere
along
the
Wall,
between
the
three
fortresses,
the
wildwood
had
come
creeping
back
over
the
decades,
that
there
were
places
where
grey-green
sentinels
and
pale
white
weirwoods
had
taken
root
in
the
shadow
of
the
Wall
itself,
but
Castle
Black
had
a
prodigious
appetite
for
firewood,
and
here
the
forest
was
still
kept
at
bay
by
the
axes
of
the
black
brothers.

It
was
never
far,
though.
From
up
here
Tyrion
could
see
it,
the
dark
trees
looming
beyond
the
stretch
of
open
ground,
like
a
second
wall
built
parallel
to
the
first,
a
wall
of
night.
Few
axes
had
ever
swung
in
that
black
wood,
where
even
the
moonlight
could
not
penetrate
the
ancient
tangle
of
root
and
thorn
and
grasping
limb.
Out
there
the
trees
grew
huge,
and
the
rangers
said
they
seemed
to
brood
and
knew
not
men.
It
was
small
wonder
the
Night’s
Watch
named
it
the
haunted
forest.

As
he
stood
there
and
looked
at
all
that
darkness
with
no
fires
burning
anywhere,
with
the
wind
blowing
and
the
cold
like
a
spear
in
his
guts,
Tyrion
Lannister
felt
as
though
he
could
almost
believe
the
talk
of
the
Others,
the
enemy
in
the
night.
His
jokes
of
grumkins
and
snarks
no
longer
seemed
quite
so
droll.

“My
uncle
is
out
there,”
Jon
Snow
said
softly,
leaning
on
his
spear
as
he
stared
off
into
the
darkness.
“The
first
night
they
sent
me
up
here,
I
thought,
Uncle
Benjen
will
ride
back
tonight,
and
I’ll
see
him
first
and
blow
the
horn.
He
never
came,
though.
Not
that
night
and
not
any
night.”

“Give
him
time,”
Tyrion
said.

Far
off
to
the
north,
a
wolf
began
to
howl.
Another
voice
picked
up
the
call,
then
another.
Ghost
cocked
his
head
and
listened.
“If
he
doesn’t
come
back,”
Jon
Snow
promised,
“Ghost
and
I
will
go
find
him.”
He
put
his
hand
on
the
direwolf’s
head.

“I
believe
you,”
Tyrion
said,
but
what
he
thought
was,
And
who
will
go
find
you?
He
shivered.





ARYA

Her
father
had
been
fighting
with
the
council
again.
Arya
could
see
it
on
his
face
when
he
came
to
table,
late
again,
as
he
had
been
so
often.
The
first
course,
a
thick
sweet
soup
made
with
pumpkins,
had
already
been
taken
away
when
Ned
Stark
strode
into
the
Small
Hall.
They
called
it
that
to
set
it
apart
from
the
Great
Hall,
where
the
king
could
feast
a
thousand,
but
it
was
a
long
room
with
a
high
vaulted
ceiling
and
bench
space
for
two
hundred
at
its
trestle
tables.

“My
lord,”
Jory
said
when
Father
entered.
He
rose
to
his
feet,
and
the
rest
of
the
guard
rose
with
him.
Each
man
wore
a
new
cloak,
heavy
grey
wool
with
a
white
satin
border.
A
hand
of
beaten
silver
clutched
the
woolen
folds
of
each
cloak
and
marked
their
wearers
as
men
of
the
Hand’s
household
guard.
There
were
only
fifty
of
them,
so
most
of
the
benches
were
empty.

“Be
seated,”
Eddard
Stark
said.
“I
see
you
have
started
without
me.
I
am
pleased
to
know
there
are
still
some
men
of
sense
in
this
city.”
He
signaled
for
the
meal
to
resume.
The
servants
began
bringing
out
platters
of
ribs,
roasted
in
a
crust
of
garlic
and
herbs.

“The
talk
in
the
yard
is
we
shall
have
a
tourney,
my
lord,”
Jory
said
as
he
resumed
his
seat.
“They
say
that
knights
will
come
from
all
over
the
realm
to
joust
and
feast
in
honor
of
your
appointment
as
Hand
of
the
King.”

Arya
could
see
that
her
father
was
not
very
happy
about
that.
“Do
they
also
say
this
is
the
last
thing
in
the
world
I
would
have
wished?”

Sansa’s
eyes
had
grown
wide
as
the
plates.
“A
tourney,”
she
breathed.
She
was
seated
between
Septa
Mordane
and
Jeyne
Poole,
as
far
from
Arya
as
she
could
get
without
drawing
a
reproach
from
Father.
“Will
we
be
permitted
to
go,
Father?”

“You
know
my
feelings,
Sansa.
It
seems
I
must
arrange
Robert’s
games
and
pretend
to
be
honored
for
his
sake.
That
does
not
mean
I
must
subject
my
daughters
to
this
folly.”

“Oh,
please,”
Sansa
said.
“I
want
to
see.”

Septa
Mordane
spoke
up.
“Princess
Myrcella
will
be
there,
my
lord,
and
her
younger
than
Lady
Sansa.
All
the
ladies
of
the
court
will
be
expected
at
a
grand
event
like
this,
and
as
the
tourney
is
in
your
honor,
it
would
look
queer
if
your
family
did
not
attend.”

Father
looked
pained.
“I
suppose
so.
Very
well,
I
shall
arrange
a
place
for
you,
Sansa.”
He
saw
Arya.
“For
both
of
you.”

“I
don’t
care
about
their
stupid
tourney,”
Arya
said.
She
knew
Prince
Joffrey
would
be
there,
and
she
hated
Prince
Joffrey.

Sansa
lifted
her
head.
“It
will
be
a
splendid
event.
You
shan’t
be
wanted.”

Anger
flashed
across
Father’s
face.
“Enough,
Sansa.
More
of
that
and
you
will
change
my
mind.
I
am
weary
unto
death
of
this
endless
war
you
two
are
fighting.
You
are
sisters.
I
expect
you
to
behave
like
sisters,
is
that
understood?”

Sansa
bit
her
lip
and
nodded.
Arya
lowered
her
face
to
stare
sullenly
at
her
plate.
She
could
feel
tears
stinging
her
eyes.
She
rubbed
them
away
angrily,
determined
not
to
cry.

The
only
sound
was
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks.
“Pray
excuse
me,”
her
father
announced
to
the
table.
“I
find
I
have
small
appetite
tonight.”
He
walked
from
the
hall.

After
he
was
gone,
Sansa
exchanged
excited
whispers
with
Jeyne
Poole.
Down
the
table
Jory
laughed
at
a
joke,
and
Hullen
started
in
about
horseflesh.
“Your
warhorse,
now,
he
may
not
be
the
best
one
for
the
joust.
Not
the
same
thing,
oh,
no,
not
the
same
at
all.”
The
men
had
heard
it
all
before;
Desmond,
Jacks,
and
Hullen’s
son
Harwin
shouted
him
down
together,
and
Porther
called
for
more
wine.

No
one
talked
to
Arya.
She
didn’t
care.
She
liked
it
that
way.
She
would
have
eaten
her
meals
alone
in
her
bedchamber
if
they
let
her.
Sometimes
they
did,
when
Father
had
to
dine
with
the
king
or
some
lord
or
the
envoys
from
this
place
or
that
place.
The
rest
of
the
time,
they
ate
in
his
solar,
just
him
and
her
and
Sansa.
That
was
when
Arya
missed
her
brothers
most.
She
wanted
to
tease
Bran
and
play
with
baby
Rickon
and
have
Robb
smile
at
her.
She
wanted
Jon
to
muss
up
her
hair
and
call
her
“little
sister”
and
finish
her
sentences
with
her.
But
all
of
them
were
gone.
She
had
no
one
left
but
Sansa,
and
Sansa
wouldn’t
even
talk
to
her
unless
Father
made
her.

Back
at
Winterfell,
they
had
eaten
in
the
Great
Hall
almost
half
the
time.
Her
father
used
to
say
that
a
lord
needed
to
eat
with
his
men,
if
he
hoped
to
keep
them.
“Know
the
men
who
follow
you,”
she
heard
him
tell
Robb
once,
“and
let
them
know
you.
Don’t
ask
your
men
to
die
for
a
stranger.”
At
Winterfell,
he
always
had
an
extra
seat
set
at
his
own
table,
and
every
day
a
different
man
would
be
asked
to
join
him.
One
night
it
would
be
Vayon
Poole,
and
the
talk
would
be
coppers
and
bread
stores
and
servants.
The
next
time
it
would
be
Mikken,
and
her
father
would
listen
to
him
go
on
about
armor
and
swords
and
how
hot
a
forge
should
be
and
the
best
way
to
temper
steel.
Another
day
it
might
be
Hullen
with
his
endless
horse
talk,
or
Septon
Chayle
from
the
library,
or
Jory,
or
Ser
Rodrik,
or
even
Old
Nan
with
her
stories.

Arya
had
loved
nothing
better
than
to
sit
at
her
father’s
table
and
listen
to
them
talk.
She
had
loved
listening
to
the
men
on
the
benches
too;
to
freeriders
tough
as
leather,
courtly
knights
and
bold
young
squires,
grizzled
old
men-at-arms.
She
used
to
throw
snowballs
at
them
and
help
them
steal
pies
from
the
kitchen.
Their
wives
gave
her
scones
and
she
invented
names
for
their
babies
and
played
monsters-and-maidens
and
hide-the-treasure
and
come-into-my-castle
with
their
children.
Fat
Tom
used
to
call
her
“Arya
Underfoot,”
because
he
said
that
was
where
she
always
was.
She’d
liked
that
a
lot
better
than
“Arya
Horseface.”

Only
that
was
Winterfell,
a
world
away,
and
now
everything
was
changed.
This
was
the
first
time
they
had
supped
with
the
men
since
arriving
in
King’s
Landing.
Arya
hated
it.
She
hated
the
sounds
of
their
voices
now,
the
way
they
laughed,
the
stories
they
told.
They’d
been
her
friends,
she’d
felt
safe
around
them,
but
now
she
knew
that
was
a
lie.
They’d
let
the
queen
kill
Lady,
that
was
horrible
enough,
but
then
the
Hound
found
Mycah.
Jeyne
Poole
had
told
Arya
that
he’d
cut
him
up
in
so
many
pieces
that
they’d
given
>>>>>>> asd
him
back
to
the
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
palace,
at
the
least.
“All
I
want
is
to
end
this...
this...”

“Is
that
gallant,
ser?
You
hurt
me.
I
begin
to
think
that
all
your
words
of
love
were
lies.”

I
could
never
lie
to
you.
Ser
Arys
felt
as
if
she’d
slapped
him.
“Why
else
would
I
have
forsaken
all
my
honor,
but
for
love?
When
I
am
with
you
I...
I
can
scarcely
think,
you
are
all
I
ever
dreamt
of,
but...”

“Words
are
wind.
If
you
love
me,
do
not
leave
me.”

“I
swore
a
vow...”

“...not
to
wed
or
father
children.
Well,
I
have
drunk
my
moon
tea,
and
you
know
I
cannot
marry
you.”
She
smiled.
“Though
I
might
be
persuaded
to
keep
you
for
my
paramour.”

“Now
you
mock
me.”

“Perhaps
a
little.
Do
=======
butcher
in
a
bag,
and
at
first
the
poor
man
had
thought
it
was
a
pig
they’d
slaughtered.
And
no
one
had
raised
a
voice
or
drawn
a
blade
or
anything,
not
Harwin
who
always
talked
so
bold,
or
Alyn
who
was
going
to
be
a
knight,
or
Jory
who
was
captain
of
the
guard.
Not
even
her
father.

“He
was
my
friend,”
Arya
whispered
into
her
plate,
so
low
that
no
one
could
hear.
Her
ribs
sat
there
untouched,
grown
cold
now,
a
thin
film
of
grease
congealing
beneath
them
on
the
plate.
Arya
looked
at
them
and
felt
ill.
She
pushed
away
from
the
table.

“Pray,
where
do
>>>>>>> asd
you
think
you
are

the
only
Kingsguard
who
ever
loved
a
woman?”

“There
have
always
been
men
who
found
it
easier
to
speak
vows
than
to
keep
them,”
he
admitted.
Ser
Boros
Blount
was
no
stranger
to
the
Street
of
Silk,
and
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
used
to
call
at
a
certain
draper’s
house
whenever
the
draper
was
away,
but
Arys
would
not
shame
his
Sworn
Brothers
by
speaking
of
their
failings.
“Ser
Terrence
Toyne
was
found
abed
with
his
king’s
mistress,”
he
said
instead.
“’Twas
love,
he
swore,
but
it
cost
his
life
and
hers,
and
brought
about
the
downfall
of
his
House
and
the
death
of
the
noblest
knight
who
ever
lived.”

“Yes,
and
what
of
Lucamore
the
Lusty,
with
his
three
wives
and
sixteen
children?
The
song
always
makes
me
laugh.”

“The
truth
is
not
so
funny.
He
was
never
called
Lucamore
the
Lusty
whilst
he
lived.
His
name
was
Ser
Lucamore
Strong,
and
his
whole
life
was
a
lie.
When
his
deceit
was
discovered,
his
own
Sworn
Brothers
gelded
him,
and
the
Old
King
sent
him
to
the
Wall.
Those
sixteen
children
were
left
weeping.
He
was
no
true
knight,
no
more
than
Terrence
Toyne...”

“And
the
Dragonknight?”
She
flung
the
bedclothes
aside
and
swung
her
legs
to
the
floor.
“The
noblest
knight
who
ever
lived,
you
said,
and
he
took
his
queen
to
bed
and
got
her
with
child.”

“I
will
not
believe
that,”
he
said,
offended.
“The
tale
of
Prince
Aemon’s
treason
with
Queen
Naerys
was
only
that,
a
tale,
a
lie
his
brother
told
when
he
wished
to
set
his
trueborn
son
aside
in
favor
of
his
bastard.
Aegon
was
not
called
the
Unworthy
without
cause.”
He
found
his
swordbelt
and
buckled
it
around
his
waist.
Though
it
looked
queer
against
the
silken
Dornish
undertunic,
the
familiar
weight
of
longsword
and
dagger
reminded
him
of
who
and
what
he
was.
“I
will
not
be
remembered
as
Ser
Arys
the
Unworthy,”
he
declared.
“I
will
not
soil
my
cloak.”

“Yes,”
she
said,
“that
fine
white
cloak.
You
forget,
my
great-uncle
wore
the
same
cloak.
He
died
when
I
was
little,
yet
I
still
remember
him.
He
was
as
tall
as
a
tower
and
used
to
tickle
me
until
I
could
not
breathe
for
laughing.”

“I
never
had
the
honor
to
know
Prince
Lewyn,”
Ser
Arys
said,
“but
all
agree
that
he
was
a
great
knight.”

“A
great
knight
with
a
paramour.
She
is
an
old
woman
now,
but
she
was
a
rare
beauty
in
her
youth,
men
say.”

Prince
Lewyn?
That
tale
Ser
Arys
had
not
heard.
It
shocked
him.
Terrence
Toyne’s
treason
and
the
deceits
of
Lucamore
the
Lusty
were
recorded
in
the
White
Book,
but
there
was
no
hint
of
a
woman
on
Prince
Lewyn’s
page.

“My
uncle
always
said
that
it
was
the
sword
in
a
man’s
hand
that
determined
his
worth,
not
the
one
between
his
legs,”
she
went
on,
“so
spare
me
all
your
pious
talk
of
soiled
cloaks.
It
is
not
our
love
that
has
dishonored
you,
it
is
the
monsters
you
have
served
and
the
brutes
you’ve
called
your
brothers.”

That
cut
too
close
to
the
bone.
“Robert
was
no
monster.”

“He
climbed
onto
his
throne
over
the
corpses
of
children,”
she
said,
“though
I
will
grant
you
he
was
no
Joffrey.”

Joffrey.
He
had
been
a
handsome
lad,
tall
and
strong
for
his
age,
but
that
was
all
the
good
that
could
be
said
of
him.
It
still
shamed
Ser
Arys
to
remember
all
the
times
he’d
struck
that
poor
Stark
girl
at
the
boy’s
command.
When
Tyrion
had
chosen
him
to
go
with
Myrcella
to
Dorne,
he
lit
a
candle
to
the
Warrior
in
thanks.
“Joffrey
is
dead,
poisoned
by
the
Imp.”
He
would
never
have
thought
the
dwarf
capable
of
such
enormity.
“Tommen
is
king
now,
and
he
is
not
his
brother.”

“Nor
is
he
his
sister.”

It
was
true.
Tommen
was
a
good-hearted
little
man
who
always
tried
his
best,
but
the
last
time
Ser
Arys
saw
him
he
had
been
weeping
on
the
quay.
Myrcella
never
shed
a
tear,
though
it
was
she
who
was
leaving
hearth
and
home
to
seal
an
alliance
with
her
maidenhood.
The
truth
was,
the
princess
was
braver
than
her
brother,
and
brighter
and
more
confident
as
well.
Her
wits
were
quicker,
her
courtesies
more
polished.
Nothing
ever
daunted
her,
not
even
Joffrey.
The
women
are
the
strong
ones,
truly.
He
was
thinking
not
only
of
Myrcella,
but
of
her
mother
and
his
own,
of
the
Queen
of
Thorns,
of
the
Red
Viper’s
pretty,
deadly
Sand
Snakes.
And
of
Princess
Arianne
Martell,
her
most
of
all.
“I
will
not
say
that
you
are
wrong.”
His
voice
was
hoarse.

“Will
not?
Cannot!
Myrcella
is
more
fit
for
rule...”

“A
son
comes
before
a
daughter.”

“Why?
What
god
has
made
it
so?
I
am
my
father’s
heir.
Should
I
give
up
my
rights
to
my
brothers?”

“You
twist
my
words.
I
never
said...
Dorne
is
different.
The
Seven
Kingdoms
have
never
had
a
ruling
queen.”

“The
first
Viserys
intended
his
daughter
Rhaenyra
to
follow
him,
do
you
deny
it?
But
as
the
king
lay
dying
the
Lord
Commander
of
his
Kingsguard
decided
that
it
should
be
otherwise.”

Ser
Criston
Cole.
Criston
the
Kingmaker
had
set
brother
against
sister
and
divided
the
Kingsguard
against
itself,
bringing
on
the
terrible
war
the
singers
named
the
Dance
of
the
Dragons.
Some
claimed
he
acted
from
ambition,
for
Prince
Aegon
was
more
tractable
than
his
willful
older
sister.
Others
allowed
him
nobler
motives,
and
argued
that
he
was
defending
ancient
Andal
custom.
A
few
whispered
that
Ser
Criston
had
been
Princess
Rhaenyra’s
lover
before
he
took
the
white
and
wanted
vengeance
on
the
woman
who
had
spurned
him.
“The
Kingmaker
wrought
grave
harm,”
Ser
Arys
said,
“and
gravely
did
he
pay
for
it,
but...”

“...but
perhaps
the
Seven
sent
you
here
so
that
one
white
knight
might
make
right
what
another
set
awry.
You
do
know
that
when
my
father
returns
to
the
Water
Gardens
he
plans
to
take
Myrcella
with
him?”

“To
keep
her
safe
from
those
who
would
do
her
harm.”

“No.
To
keep
her
away
from
those
who’d
seek
to
crown
her.
Prince
Oberyn
Viper
would
have
placed
the
crown
upon
her
head
himself
if
he
had
lived,
but
my
father
lacks
the
courage.”
She
got
to
her
feet.
“You
say
you
love
the
girl
as
you
would
a
daughter
of
your
own
blood.
Would
you
let
your
daughter
be
despoiled
of
her
rights
and
locked
away
in
prison?”

“The
Water
Gardens
are
no
prison,”
he
protested
feebly.

“A
prison
does
not
have
fountains
and
fig
trees,
is
that
what
you
think?
Yet
once
the
girl
is
there,
she
will
not
be
allowed
to
leave.
No
more
than
you
will.
Hotah
will
see
to
that.
You
do
not
know
him
as
I
do.
He
is
terrible
when
aroused.”

Ser
Arys
frowned.
The
big
Norvoshi
captain
with
the
scarred
face
had
always
made
him
feel
profoundly
uneasy.
They
say
he
sleeps
with
that
great
axe
beside
him.
“What
would
you
have
me
do?”

“No
more
than
you
have
sworn.
Protect
Myrcella
with
your
life.
Defend
her...
and
her
rights.
Set
a
crown
upon
her
head.”

“I
swore
an
oath!”

“To
Joffrey,
not
to
Tommen.”

“Aye,
but
Tommen
is
a
good-hearted
boy.
He
will
be
a
better
king
than
Joffrey.”

“But
not
better
than
Myrcella.
She
loves
the
boy
as
well.
I
know
she
will
not
let
him
come
to
any
harm.
Storm’s
End
is
his
by
rights,
since
Lord
Renly
left
no
heir
and
Lord
Stannis
is
attainted.
In
time,
Casterly
Rock
will
pass
to
the
boy
as
well,
through
his
lady
mother.
He
will
be
as
great
a
lord
as
any
in
the
realm...
but
Myrcella
by
rights
should
sit
the
Iron
Throne.”

“The
law...
I
do
not
know...”

“I
do.”
When
she
stood,
the
long
black
tangle
of
her
hair
fell
down
to
the
small
of
her
back.
“Aegon
the
Dragon
made
the
Kingsguard
and
its
vows,
but
what
one
king
does
another
can
undo,
or
change.
Formerly
the
Kingsguard
served
for
life,
yet
Joffrey
dismissed
Ser
Barristan
so
his
dog
could
have
a
cloak.
Myrcella
would
want
you
to
be
happy,
and
she
is
fond
of
me
as
well.
She
will
give
us
leave
to
marry
if
we
ask.”
Arianne
put
her
arms
around
him
and
laid
her
face
against
his
chest.
The
top
of
her
head
came
to
just
beneath
his
chin.
“You
can
have
me
and
your
white
cloak
both,
if
that
is
what
you
want.”

She
is
tearing
me
apart.
“You
know
I
do,
but...”

“I
am
a
princess
of
Dorne,”
she
said
in
her
husky
voice,
“and
it
is
not
meet
that
you
should
make
me
beg.”

Ser
Arys
could
smell
the
perfume
in
her
hair
and
feel
her
heart
beating
as
she
pressed
against
him.
His
body
was
responding
to
her
closeness,
and
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
could
feel
it
too.
When
he
put
his
arms
upon
her
shoulders,
he
realized
she
was
trembling.
“Arianne?
My
princess?
What
is
it,
my
love?”

“Must
I
say
it,
ser?
I
am
afraid.
You
call
me
love,
yet
you
refuse
me,
when
I
have
most
desperate
need
of
you.
Is
it
so
wrong
of
me
to
want
a
knight
to
keep
me
safe?”

He
had
never
heard
her
sound
so
vulnerable.
“No,”
he
said,
“but
you
have
your
father’s
guards
to
keep
you
safe,
why—”

“It
is
my
father’s
guards
I
fear.”
For
a
moment
she
sounded
younger
than
Myrcella.
“It
was
my
father’s
guards
who
dragged
my
sweet
cousins
off
in
chains.”

“Not
in
chains.
I
have
heard
that
they
have
every
comfort.”

She
gave
a
bitter
laugh.
“Have
you
seen
them?
He
will
not
permit
me
to
see
them,
did
you
know
that?”

“They
were
speaking
treason,
fomenting
war...”

“Loreza
is
six,
Dorea
eight.
What
wars
could
they
foment?
Yet
my
father
has
imprisoned
them
with
their
sisters.
You
have
seen
him.
Fear
makes
even
strong
men
do
things
they
might
never
do
otherwise,
and
my
father
was
never
strong.
Arys,
my
heart,
hear
me
for
the
love
you
say
you
bear
me.
I
have
never
been
as
fearless
as
my
cousins,
for
I
was
made
with
weaker
seed,
but
Tyene
and
I
are
of
an
age
and
have
been
close
as
sisters
since
we
were
little
girls.
We
have
no
secrets
between
us.
If
she
can
be
imprisoned,
so
can
I,
and
for
the
same
cause...
this
of
Myrcella.”

“Your
father
would
never
do
that.”

“You
do
not
know
my
father.
I
have
been
disappointing
him
since
I
first
arrived
in
this
world
without
a
cock.
Half
a
dozen
times
he
has
tried
to
marry
me
to
toothless
greybeards,
each
more
contemptible
than
the
last.
He
never
commanded
me
to
wed
them,
I
grant
you,
but
the
offers
alone
prove
how
little
he
regards
me.”

“Even
so,
you
are
his
heir.”

“Am
I?”

“He
left
you
to
rule
in
Sunspear
when
he
took
himself
off
to
his
Water
Gardens,
did
he
not?”

“To
rule?
No.
He
left
his
cousin
Ser
Manfrey
as
castellan,
old
blind
Ricasso
as
seneschal,
his
bailiffs
to
collect
duties
and
taxes
for
his
treasurer
Alyse
Ladybright
to
count,
his
shariffs
to
police
the
shadow
city,
his
justiciars
to
sit
in
judgment,
and
Maester
Myles
to
deal
with
any
letters
not
requiring
the
prince’s
own
attention.
Above
them
all
he
placed
the
Red
Viper.
My
charge
was
feasts
and
frolics,
and
the
entertainment
of
distinguished
guests.
Oberyn
would
visit
the
Water
Gardens
twice
a
fortnight.
Me,
he
summoned
twice
a
year.
I
am
not
the
heir
my
father
wants,
he
has
made
that
plain.
Our
laws
constrain
him,
but
he
would
sooner
have
my
brother
follow
him,
I
know
it.”

“Your
brother?”
Ser
Arys
put
his
hand
beneath
her
chin
and
raised
her
head,
the
better
to
look
her
in
the
eyes.
“You
cannot
mean
Trystane,
he
is
just
a
boy.”

“Not
Trys.
Quentyn.”
Her
eyes
were
bold
and
black
as
sin,
unflinching.
“I
have
known
the
truth
since
I
was
four-and-ten,
since
the
day
that
I
went
to
my
father’s
solar
to
give
him
a
good
night
kiss,
and
found
him
gone.
My
mother
had
sent
for
him,
I
learned
later.
He’d
left
a
candle
burning.
When
I
went
to
blow
it
out,
I
found
a
letter
lying
incomplete
beside
it,
a
letter
to
my
brother
Quentyn,
off
at
Yronwood.
My
father
told
Quentyn
that
he
must
do
all
that
his
maester
and
his
master-at-arms
required
of
him,
because
‘one
day
you
will
sit
where
I
sit
and
rule
all
Dorne,
and
a
ruler
must
be
strong
of
mind
and
body.’”
A
tear
crept
down
Arianne’s
soft
cheek.
“My
father’s
words,
written
in
his
own
hand.
They
burned
themselves
into
my
memory.
I
cried
myself
to
sleep
that
night,
and
many
nights
thereafter.”

Ser
Arys
had
yet
to
meet
Quentyn
Martell.
The
prince
had
been
fostered
by
Lord
Yronwood
from
a
tender
age,
had
served
him
as
a
page,
then
a
squire,
had
even
taken
knighthood
at
his
hands
in
preference
to
the
Red
Viper’s.
If
I
were
a
father,
I
would
want
my
son
to
follow
me
as
well,
he
thought,
but
he
could
hear
the
hurt
in
her
voice,
and
he
knew
that
if
he
said
what
he
was
thinking,
he
would
lose
her.
“Perhaps
you
misunderstood,”
he
said.
“You
were
only
a
child.
Perhaps
the
prince
was
only
saying
that
to
encourage
your
brother
to
be
more
diligent.”

“You
think
so?
Then
tell
me,
where
is
Quentyn
now?”

“The
prince
is
with
Lord
Yronwood’s
host
in
the
Boneway,”
Ser
Arys
said
cautiously.
That
was
what
Sunspear’s
ancient
castellan
had
told
him,
when
first
he
came
to
Dorne.
The
maester
with
the
silky
beard
said
the
same.

Arianne
demurred.
“So
my
father
wishes
us
to
believe,
but
I
have
friends
who
tell
me
otherwise.
My
brother
has
crossed
the
narrow
sea
in
secret,
posing
as
a
common
merchant.
Why?”

“How
would
I
know?
There
could
be
a
hundred
reasons.”

“Or
one.
Are
you
aware
that
the
Golden
Company
has
broken
its
contract
with
Myr?”

“Sellswords
break
their
contracts
all
the
time.”

“Not
the
Golden
Company.
Our
word
is
good
as
gold
has
been
their
boast
since
the
days
of
Bittersteel.
Myr
is
on
the
point
of
war
with
Lys
and
Tyrosh.
Why
break
a
contract
that
offered
them
the
prospect
of
good
wages
and
good
plunder?”

“Perhaps
Lys
offered
them
better
wages.
Or
Tyrosh.”

“No,”
she
said.
“I
would
believe
it
of
any
of
the
other
free
companies,
yes.
Most
of
them
would
change
sides
for
half
a
groat.
The
Golden
Company
is
different.
A
brotherhood
of
exiles
and
the
sons
of
exiles,
united
by
the
dream
of
Bittersteel.
It’s
home
they
want,
as
much
as
gold.
Lord
Yronwood
knows
that
as
well
as
I
do.
His
forebears
rode
with
Bittersteel
during
three
of
the
Blackfyre
Rebellions.”
She
took
Ser
Arys
by
the
hand,
and
wove
her
fingers
through
his
own.
“Have
you
ever
seen
the
arms
of
House
Toland
of
Ghost
Hill?”

He
had
to
think
a
moment.
“A
dragon
eating
its
own
tail?”

“The
dragon
is
time.
It
has
no
beginning
and
no
ending,
so
all
things
come
round
again.
Anders
Yronwood
is
Criston
Cole
reborn.
He
whispers
in
my
brother’s
ear
that
he
should
rule
after
my
father,
that
it
is
not
right
for
men
to
kneel
to
women...
that
Arianne
especially
is
unfit
to
rule,
being
the
willful
wanton
that
she
is.”
She
tossed
her
hair
defiantly.
“So
your
two
princesses
share
a
common
cause,
ser...
and
they
share
as
well
a
knight
who
claims
to
love
them
both,
but
will
not
fight
for
them.”

“I
will.”
Ser
Arys
sank
to
one
knee.
“Myrcella
is
the
elder,
and
better
suited
to
the
crown.
Who
will
defend
her
rights
if
not
her
Kingsguard?
My
sword,
my
life,
my
honor,
all
belong
to
her...
and
to
you,
my
heart’s
delight.
I
swear,
no
man
will
steal
your
birthright
whilst
I
still
have
the
strength
to
lift
a
sword.
I
am
yours.
What
would
you
have
of
me?”

“All.”
She
knelt
to
kiss
his
lips.
“All,
my
love,
my
true
love,
my
sweet
love,
and
forever.
But
first...”

“Ask,
and
it
is
yours.”

“...Myrcella.”
=======
going,
young
lady?”
Septa
Mordane
asked.

“I’m
not
hungry.”
Arya
found
it
an
effort
to
remember
her
courtesies.
“May
I
be
excused,
please?”
she
recited
stiffly.

“You
may
not,”
the
septa
said.
“You
have
scarcely
touched
your
food.
You
will
sit
down
and
clean
your
plate.”

“You
clean
it!”
Before
anyone
could
stop
her,
Arya
bolted
for
the
door
as
the
men
laughed
and
Septa
Mordane
called
loudly
after
her,
her
voice
rising
higher
and
higher.

Fat
Tom
was
at
his
post,
guarding
the
door
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
He
blinked
when
he
saw
Arya
rushing
toward
him
and
heard
the
septa’s
shouts.
“Here
now,
little
one,
hold
on,”
he
started
to
say,
reaching,
but
Arya
slid
between
his
legs
and
then
she
was
running
up
the
winding
tower
steps,
her
feet
hammering
on
the
stone
while
Fat
Tom
huffed
and
puffed
behind
her.

Her
bedchamber
was
the
only
place
that
Arya
liked
in
all
of
King’s
Landing,
and
the
thing
she
liked
best
about
it
was
the
door,
a
massive
slab
of
dark
oak
with
black
iron
bands.
When
she
slammed
that
door
and
dropped
the
heavy
crossbar,
nobody
could
get
into
her
room,
not
Septa
Mordane
or
Fat
Tom
or
Sansa
or
Jory
or
the
Hound,
nobody!
She
slammed
it
now.

When
the
bar
was
down,
Arya
finally
felt
safe
enough
to
cry.

She
went
to
the
window
seat
and
sat
there,
sniffling,
hating
them
all,
and
herself
most
of
all.
It
was
all
her
fault,
everything
bad
that
had
happened.
Sansa
said
so,
and
Jeyne
too.

Fat
Tom
was
knocking
on
her
door.
“Arya
girl,
what’s
wrong?”
he
called
out.
“You
in
there?”

“No!”
she
shouted.
The
knocking
stopped.
A
moment
later
she
heard
him
going
away.
Fat
Tom
was
always
easy
to
fool.

Arya
went
to
the
chest
at
the
foot
of
her
bed.
She
knelt,
opened
the
lid,
and
began
pulling
her
clothes
out
with
both
hands,
grabbing
handfuls
of
silk
and
satin
and
velvet
and
wool
and
tossing
them
on
the
floor.
It
was
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
chest,
where
she’d
hidden
it.
Arya
lifted
it
out
almost
tenderly
and
drew
the
slender
blade
from
its
sheath.

Needle.

She
thought
of
Mycah
again
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
Her
fault,
her
fault,
her
fault.
If
she
had
never
asked
him
to
play
at
swords
with
her…

There
was
a
pounding
at
her
door,
louder
than
before.
“Arya
Stark,
you
open
this
door
at
once,
do
you
hear
me?”

Arya
spun
around,
with
Needle
in
her
hand.
“You
better
not
come
in
here!”
she
warned.
She
slashed
at
the
air
savagely.

“The
Hand
will
hear
of
this!”
Septa
Mordane
raged.

“I
don’t
care,”
Arya
screamed.
“Go
away.”

“You
will
rue
this
insolent
behavior,
young
lady,
I
promise
you
that.”
Arya
listened
at
the
door
until
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
septa’s
receding
footsteps.

She
went
back
to
the
window,
Needle
in
hand,
and
looked
down
into
the
courtyard
below.
If
only
she
could
climb
like
Bran,
she
thought;
she
would
go
out
the
window
and
down
the
tower,
run
away
from
this
horrible
place,
away
from
Sansa
and
Septa
Mordane
and
Prince
Joffrey,
from
all
of
them.
Steal
some
food
from
the
kitchens,
take
Needle
and
her
good
boots
and
a
warm
cloak.
She
could
find
Nymeria
in
the
wild
woods
below
the
Trident,
and
together
they’d
return
to
Winterfell,
or
run
to
Jon
on
the
Wall.
She
found
herself
wishing
that
Jon
was
here
with
her
now.
Then
maybe
she
wouldn’t
feel
so
alone.

A
soft
knock
at
the
door
behind
her
turned
Arya
away
from
the
window
and
her
dreams
of
escape.
“Arya,”
her
father’s
voice
called
out.
“Open
the
door.
We
need
to
talk.”

Arya
crossed
the
room
and
lifted
the
crossbar.
Father
was
alone.
He
seemed
more
sad
than
angry.
That
made
Arya
feel
even
worse.
“May
I
come
in?”
Arya
nodded,
then
dropped
her
eyes,
ashamed.
Father
closed
the
door.
“Whose
sword
is
that?”

“Mine.”
Arya
had
almost
forgotten
Needle,
in
her
hand.

“Give
it
to
me.”

Reluctantly
Arya
surrendered
her
sword,
wondering
if
she
would
ever
hold
it
again.
Her
father
turned
it
in
the
light,
examining
both
sides
of
the
blade.
He
tested
the
point
with
his
thumb.
“A
bravo’s
blade,”
he
said.
“Yet
it
seems
to
me
that
I
know
this
maker’s
mark.
This
is
Mikken’s
work.”

Arya
could
not
lie
to
him.
She
lowered
her
eyes.

Lord
Eddard
Stark
sighed.
“My
nine-year-old
daughter
is
being
armed
from
my
own
forge,
and
I
know
nothing
of
it.
The
Hand
of
the
King
is
expected
to
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
yet
it
seems
I
cannot
even
rule
my
own
household.
How
is
it
that
you
come
to
own
a
sword,
Arya?
Where
did
you
get
this?”

Arya
chewed
her
lip
and
said
nothing.
She
would
not
betray
Jon,
not
even
to
their
father.

After
a
while,
Father
said,
“I
don’t
suppose
it
matters,
truly.”
He
looked
down
gravely
at
the
sword
in
his
hands.
“This
is
no
toy
for
children,
least
of
all
for
a
girl.
What
would
Septa
Mordane
say
if
she
knew
you
were
playing
with
swords?”

“I
wasn’t
playing,”
Arya
insisted.
“I
hate
Septa
Mordane.”

“That’s
enough.”
Her
father’s
voice
was
curt
and
hard.
“The
septa
is
doing
no
more
than
is
her
duty,
though
gods
know
you
have
made
it
a
struggle
for
the
poor
woman.
Your
mother
and
I
have
charged
her
with
the
impossible
task
of
making
you
a
lady.”

“I
don’t
want
to
be
a
lady!”
Arya
flared.

“I
ought
to
snap
this
toy
across
my
knee
here
and
now,
and
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense.”

“Needle
wouldn’t
break,”
Arya
said
defiantly,
but
her
voice
betrayed
her
words.

“It
has
a
name,
does
it?”
Her
father
sighed.
“Ah,
Arya.
You
have
a
wildness
in
you,
child.
‘The
wolf
blood,’
my
father
used
to
call
it.
Lyanna
had
a
touch
of
it,
and
my
brother
Brandon
more
than
a
touch.
It
brought
them
both
to
an
early
grave.”
Arya
heard
sadness
in
his
voice;
he
did
not
often
speak
of
his
father,
or
of
the
brother
and
sister
who
had
died
before
she
was
born.
“Lyanna
might
have
carried
a
sword,
if
my
lord
father
had
allowed
it.
You
remind
me
of
her
sometimes.
You
even
look
like
her.”

“Lyanna
was
beautiful,”
Arya
said,
startled.
Everybody
said
so.
It
was
not
a
thing
that
was
ever
said
of
Arya.

“She
was,”
Eddard
Stark
agreed,
“beautiful,
and
willful,
and
dead
before
her
time.”
He
lifted
the
sword,
held
it
out
between
them.
“Arya,
what
did
you
think
to
do
with
this…
Needle?
Who
did
you
hope
to
skewer?
Your
sister?
Septa
Mordane?
Do
you
know
the
first
thing
about
sword
fighting?”

All
she
could
think
of
was
the
lesson
Jon
had
given
her.
“Stick
them
with
the
pointy
end,”
she
blurted
out.

Her
father
snorted
back
laughter.
“That
is
the
essence
of
it,
I
suppose.”

Arya
desperately
wanted
to
explain,
to
make
him
see.
“I
was
trying
to
learn,
but…”
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“I
asked
Mycah
to
practice
with
me.”
The
grief
came
on
her
all
at
once.
She
turned
away,
shaking.
“I
asked
him,”
she
cried.
“It
was
my
fault,
it
was
me…”

Suddenly
her
father’s
arms
were
around
her.
He
held
her
gently
as
she
turned
to
him
and
sobbed
against
his
chest.
“No,
sweet
one,”
he
murmured.
“Grieve
for
your
friend,
but
never
blame
yourself.
You
did
not
kill
the
butcher’s
boy.
That
murder
lies
at
the
Hound’s
door,
him
and
the
cruel
woman
he
serves.”

“I
hate
them,”
Arya
confided,
red-faced,
sniffling.
“The
Hound
and
the
queen
and
the
king
and
Prince
Joffrey.
I
hate
all
of
them.
Joffrey
lied,
it
wasn’t
the
way
he
said.
I
hate
Sansa
too.
She
did
remember,
she
just
lied
so
Joffrey
would
like
her.”

“We
all
lie,”
her
father
said.
“Or
did
you
truly
think
I’d
believe
that
Nymeria
ran
off?”

Arya
blushed
guiltily.
“Jory
promised
not
to
tell.”

“Jory
kept
his
word,”
her
father
said
with
a
smile.
“There
are
some
things
I
do
not
need
to
be
told.
Even
a
blind
man
could
see
that
wolf
would
never
have
left
you
willingly.”

“We
had
to
throw
rocks,”
she
said
miserably.
“I
told
her
to
run,
to
go
be
free,
that
I
didn’t
want
her
anymore.
There
were
other
wolves
for
her
to
play
with,
we
heard
them
howling,
and
Jory
said
the
woods
were
full
of
game,
so
she’d
have
deer
to
hunt.
Only
she
kept
following,
and
finally
we
had
to
throw
rocks.
I
hit
her
twice.
She
whined
and
looked
at
me
and
I
felt
so
’shamed,
but
it
was
right,
wasn’t
it?
The
queen
would
have
killed
her.”

“It
was
right,”
her
father
said.
“And
even
the
lie
was…
not
without
honor.”
He’d
put
Needle
aside
when
he
went
to
Arya
to
embrace
her.
Now
he
took
the
blade
up
again
and
walked
to
the
window,
where
he
stood
for
a
moment,
looking
out
across
the
courtyard.
When
he
turned
back,
his
eyes
were
thoughtful.
He
seated
himself
on
the
window
seat,
Needle
across
his
lap.
“Arya,
sit
down.
I
need
to
try
and
explain
some
things
to
you.”

She
perched
anxiously
on
the
edge
of
her
bed.
“You
are
too
young
to
be
burdened
with
all
my
cares,”
he
told
her,
“but
you
are
also
a
Stark
of
Winterfell.
You
know
our
words.”

“Winter
is
coming,”
Arya
whispered.

“The
hard
cruel
times,”
her
father
said.
“We
tasted
them
on
the
Trident,
child,
and
when
Bran
fell.
You
were
born
in
the
long
summer,
sweet
one,
you’ve
never
known
anything
else,
but
now
the
winter
is
truly
coming.
Remember
the
sigil
of
our
House,
Arya.”

“The
direwolf,”
she
said,
thinking
of
Nymeria.
She
hugged
her
knees
against
her
chest,
suddenly
afraid.

“Let
me
tell
you
something
about
wolves,
child.
When
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies,
but
the
pack
survives.
Summer
is
the
time
for
squabbles.
In
winter,
we
must
protect
one
another,
keep
each
other
warm,
share
our
strengths.
So
if
you
must
hate,
Arya,
hate
those
who
would
truly
do
us
harm.
Septa
Mordane
is
a
good
woman,
and
Sansa…
Sansa
is
your
sister.
You
may
be
as
different
as
the
sun
and
the
moon,
but
the
same
blood
flows
through
both
your
hearts.
You
need
her,
as
she
needs
you…
and
I
need
both
of
you,
gods
help
me.”

He
sounded
so
tired
that
it
made
Arya
sad.
“I
don’t
hate
Sansa,”
she
told
him.
“Not
truly.”
It
was
only
half
a
lie.

“I
do
not
mean
to
frighten
you,
but
neither
will
I
lie
to
you.
We
have
come
to
a
dark
dangerous
place,
child.
This
is
not
Winterfell.
We
have
enemies
who
mean
us
ill.
We
cannot
fight
a
war
among
ourselves.
This
willfulness
of
yours,
the
running
off,
the
angry
words,
the
disobedience…
at
home,
these
were
only
the
summer
games
of
a
child.
Here
and
now,
with
winter
soon
upon
us,
that
is
a
different
matter.
It
is
time
to
begin
growing
up.”

“I
will,”
Arya
vowed.
She
had
never
loved
him
so
much
as
she
did
in
that
instant.
“I
can
be
strong
too.
I
can
be
as
strong
as
Robb.”

He
held
Needle
out
to
her,
hilt
first.
“Here.”

She
looked
at
the
sword
with
wonder
in
her
eyes.
For
a
moment
she
was
afraid
to
touch
it,
afraid
that
if
she
reached
for
it
it
would
be
snatched
away
again,
but
then
her
father
said,
“Go
on,
it’s
yours,”
and
she
took
it
in
her
hand.

“I
can
keep
it?”
she
said.
“For
true?”

“For
true.”
He
smiled.
“If
I
took
it
away,
no
doubt
I’d
find
a
morningstar
hidden
under
your
pillow
within
the
fortnight.
Try
not
to
stab
your
sister,
whatever
the
provocation.”

“I
won’t.
I
promise.”
Arya
clutched
Needle
tightly
to
her
chest
as
her
father
took
his
leave.

The
next
morning,
as
they
broke
their
fast,
she
apologized
to
Septa
Mordane
and
asked
for
her
pardon.
The
septa
peered
at
her
suspiciously,
but
Father
nodded.

Three
days
later,
at
midday,
her
father’s
steward
Vayon
Poole
sent
Arya
to
the
Small
Hall.
The
trestle
tables
had
been
dismantled
and
the
benches
shoved
against
the
walls.
The
hall
seemed
empty,
until
an
unfamiliar
voice
said,
“You
are
late,
boy.”
A
slight
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
stepped
out
of
the
shadows,
holding
a
pair
of
slender
wooden
swords.
“Tomorrow
you
will
be
here
at
midday.”
He
had
an
accent,
the
lilt
of
the
Free
Cities,
Braavos
perhaps,
or
Myr.

“Who
are
you?”
Arya
asked.

“I
am
your
dancing
master.”
He
tossed
her
one
of
the
wooden
blades.
She
grabbed
for
it,
missed,
and
heard
it
clatter
to
the
floor.
“Tomorrow
you
will
catch
it.
Now
pick
it
up.”

It
was
not
just
a
stick,
but
a
true
wooden
sword
complete
with
grip
and
guard
and
pommel.
Arya
picked
it
up
and
clutched
it
nervously
with
both
hands,
holding
it
out
in
front
of
her.
It
was
heavier
than
it
looked,
much
heavier
than
Needle.

The
bald
man
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“That
is
not
the
way,
boy.
This
is
not
a
greatsword
that
is
needing
two
hands
to
swing
it.
You
will
take
the
blade
in
one
hand.”

“It’s
too
heavy,”
Arya
said.

“It
is
heavy
as
it
needs
to
be
to
make
you
strong,
and
for
the
balancing.
A
hollow
inside
is
filled
with
lead,
just
so.
One
hand
now
is
all
that
is
needing.”

Arya
took
her
right
hand
off
the
grip
and
wiped
her
sweaty
palm
on
her
pants.
She
held
the
sword
in
her
left
hand.
He
seemed
to
approve.
“The
left
is
good.
All
is
reversed,
it
will
make
your
enemies
more
awkward.
Now
you
are
standing
wrong.
Turn
your
body
sideface,
yes,
so.
You
are
skinny
as
the
shaft
of
a
spear,
do
you
know.
That
is
good
too,
the
target
is
smaller.
Now
the
grip.
Let
me
see.”
He
moved
closer
and
peered
at
her
hand,
prying
her
fingers
apart,
rearranging
them.
“Just
so,
yes.
Do
not
squeeze
it
so
tight,
no,
the
grip
must
be
deft,
delicate.”

“What
if
I
drop
it?”
Arya
said.

“The
steel
must
be
part
of
your
arm,”
the
bald
man
told
her.
“Can
you
drop
part
of
your
arm?
No.
Nine
years
Syrio
Forel
was
first
sword
to
the
Sealord
of
Braavos,
he
knows
these
things.
Listen
to
him,
boy.”

It
was
the
third
time
he
had
called
her
“boy.”
“I’m
a
girl,”
Arya
objected.

“Boy,
girl,”
Syrio
Forel
said.
“You
are
a
sword,
that
is
all.”
He
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“Just
so,
that
is
the
grip.
You
are
not
holding
a
battle-axe,
you
are
holding
a—”

“—needle,”
Arya
finished
for
him,
fiercely.

“Just
so.
Now
we
will
begin
the
dance.
Remember,
child,
this
is
not
the
iron
dance
of
Westeros
we
are
learning,
the
knight’s
dance,
hacking
and
hammering,
no.
This
is
the
bravo’s
dance,
the
water
dance,
swift
and
sudden.
All
men
are
made
of
water,
do
you
know
this?
When
you
pierce
them,
the
water
leaks
out
and
they
die.”
He
took
a
step
backward,
raised
his
own
wooden
blade.
“Now
you
will
try
to
strike
me.”

Arya
tried
to
strike
him.
She
tried
for
four
hours,
until
every
muscle
in
her
body
was
sore
and
aching,
while
Syrio
Forel
clicked
his
teeth
together
and
told
her
what
to
do.

The
next
day
their
real
work
began.

BRIENNE

The
stone
wall
was
old
and
crumbling,
but
the
sight
of
it
across
the
field
made
the
hairs
on
Brienne’s
neck
stand
up.

That
was
where
the
archers
hid
and
slew
poor
Cleos
Frey,
she
thought...
but
half
a
mile
farther
on
she
passed
another
wall
that
looked
much
like
the
first
and
found
herself
uncertain.
The
rutted
road
turned
and
twisted,
and
the
bare
brown
trees
looked
different
from
the
green
ones
she
remembered.
Had
she
ridden
past
the
place
where
Ser
Jaime
had
snatched
his
cousin’s
sword
from
its
scabbard?
Where
were
the
woods
they’d
fought
in?
The
stream
where
they’d
splashed
and
slashed
at
one
another
until
they
drew
the
Brave
Companions
down
upon
them?

“My
lady?
Ser?”
Podrick
never
seemed
certain
what
to
call
her.
“What
are
you
looking
for?”

Ghosts.
“A
wall
I
rode
by
once.
It
does
not
matter.”
It
was
when
Ser
Jaime
still
had
both
his
hands.
How
I
loathed
him,
with
all
his
taunts
and
smiles.
“Stay
quiet,
Podrick.
There
may
still
be
outlaws
in
these
woods.”

The
boy
looked
at
the
bare
brown
trees,
the
wet
leaves,
the
muddy
road
ahead.
“I
have
a
longsword.
I
can
fight.”

Not
well
enough.
Brienne
did
not
doubt
the
boy’s
courage,
only
his
training.
A
squire
he
might
be,
in
name
at
least,
but
the
men
he’d
squired
for
had
served
him
ill.

She
had
gotten
his
story
out
of
him
in
fits
and
starts
on
the
road
from
Duskendale.
His
was
a
lesser
branch
of
House
Payne,
an
impoverished
offshoot
sprouted
from
the
loins
of
a
younger
son.
His
father
had
spent
his
life
squiring
for
richer
cousins
and
had
sired
Podrick
upon
a
chandler’s
daughter
he’d
wed
before
going
off
to
die
in
the
Greyjoy
Rebellion.
His
mother
had
abandoned
him
with
one
of
those
cousins
when
he
was
four,
so
she
could
run
after
a
wandering
singer
who
had
put
another
baby
in
her
belly.
Podrick
did
not
remember
what
she
looked
like.
Ser
Cedric
Payne
had
been
the
nearest
thing
to
a
parent
the
boy
had
ever
known,
though
from
his
stammered
stories
it
seemed
to
Brienne
that
cousin
Cedric
had
treated
Podrick
more
like
a
servant
than
a
son.
When
Casterly
Rock
called
its
banners,
the
knight
had
taken
him
along
to
tend
his
horse
and
clean
his
mail.
Then
Ser
Cedric
had
been
slain
in
the
riverlands
whilst
fighting
in
Lord
Tywin’s
host.

Far
from
home,
alone,
and
penniless,
the
boy
had
attached
himself
to
a
fat
hedge
knight
named
Ser
Lorimer
the
Belly,
who
was
part
of
Lord
Lefford’s
contingent,
charged
with
protecting
the
baggage
train.
“The
boys
who
guard
the
foodstuffs
always
eat
the
best,”
Ser
Lorimer
liked
to
say,
until
he
was
discovered
with
a
salted
ham
he’d
stolen
from
Lord
Tywin’s
personal
stores.
Tywin
Lannister
chose
to
hang
him
as
a
lesson
to
other
looters.
Podrick
had
shared
the
ham
and
might
have
shared
the
rope
as
well,
but
his
name
had
saved
him.
Ser
Kevan
Lannister
took
charge
of
him,
and
sometime
later
sent
the
boy
to
squire
for
his
nephew
Tyrion.

Ser
Cedric
had
taught
Podrick
how
to
groom
a
horse
and
check
his
shoes
for
stones,
and
Ser
Lorimer
had
taught
him
how
to
steal,
but
neither
had
given
him
much
training
with
a
sword.
The
Imp
at
least
had
dispatched
him
to
the
Red
Keep’s
master-at-arms
when
they
came
to
court.
But
during
the
bread
riots
Ser
Aron
Santagar
had
been
amongst
those
slain,
and
that
had
been
the
end
of
Podrick’s
training.

Brienne
cut
two
wooden
swords
from
fallen
branches
to
get
a
sense
of
Podrick’s
skills.
The
boy
was
slow
of
speech
but
not
of
hand,
she
was
pleased
to
learn.
Though
fearless
and
attentive,
he
was
also
underfed
and
skinny,
and
not
near
strong
enough.
If
he
had
survived
the
Battle
of
the
Blackwater
as
he
claimed,
it
could
only
be
because
no
one
thought
him
worth
the
killing.
“You
may
call
yourself
a
squire,”
she
told
him,
“but
I’ve
seen
pages
half
your
age
who
could
have
beat
you
bloody.
If
you
stay
with
me,
you’ll
go
to
sleep
with
blisters
on
your
hands
and
bruises
on
your
arms
most
every
night,
and
you’ll
be
so
stiff
and
sore
you’ll
hardly
sleep.
You
don’t
want
that.”

“I
do,”
the
boy
insisted.
“I
want
that.
The
bruises
and
the
blisters.
I
mean,
I
don’t,
but
I
do.
Ser.
My
lady.”

So
far
he
had
been
true
to
his
word,
and
Brienne
had
been
true
to
hers.
Podrick
had
not
complained.
Every
time
he
raised
a
new
blister
on
his
sword
hand,
he
felt
the
need
to
show
it
to
her
proudly.
He
took
good
care
of
their
horses
too.
He
is
still
no
squire,
she
reminded
herself,
but
I
am
no
knight,
no
matter
how
many
times
he
calls
me
“ser.”
She
would
have
sent
him
on
his
way,
but
he
had
nowhere
to
go.
Besides,
though
Podrick
said
he
did
not
know
where
Sansa
Stark
had
gone,
it
might
be
that
he
knew
more
than
he
realized.
Some
chance
remark,
half-remembered,
might
hold
the
key
to
Brienne’s
quest.

“Ser?
My
lady?”
Podrick
pointed.
“There’s
a
cart
ahead.”

Brienne
saw
it:
a
wooden
oxcart,
two-wheeled
and
high-sided.
A
man
and
a
woman
were
laboring
in
the
traces,
pulling
the
cart
along
the
ruts
toward
Maidenpool.
Farm
folk,
by
the
look
of
them.
“Slowly
now,”
she
told
the
boy.
“They
may
take
us
for
outlaws.
Say
no
more
than
you
must
and
be
courteous.”

“I
will,
ser.
Be
courteous.
My
lady.”
The
boy
seemed
almost
pleased
by
the
prospect
of
being
taken
for
an
outlaw.

The
farm
folk
watched
them
warily
as
they
came
trotting
up,
but
once
Brienne
made
it
plain
that
she
meant
them
no
harm,
they
let
her
ride
beside
them.
“We
used
to
have
an
ox,”
the
old
man
told
her
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
weed-choked
fields,
lakes
of
soft
mud,
and
burnt
and
blackened
trees,
“but
the
wolves
made
off
with
him.”
His
face
was
red
from
the
effort
of
pulling
the
cart.
“They
took
off
our
daughter
too
and
had
their
way
with
her,
but
she
come
wandering
back
after
the
battle
down
at
Duskendale.
The
ox
never
did.
The
wolves
ate
him,
I
expect.”

The
woman
had
little
to
add.
She
was
younger
than
the
man
by
twenty
years,
but
never
spoke
a
word,
only
looked
at
Brienne
the
same
way
she
might
have
looked
at
a
two-headed
calf.
The
Maid
of
Tarth
had
seen
such
eyes
before.
Lady
Stark
had
been
kind
to
her,
but
most
women
were
just
as
cruel
as
men.
She
could
not
have
said
which
she
found
most
hurtful,
the
pretty
girls
with
their
waspish
tongues
and
brittle
laughter
or
the
cold-eyed
ladies
who
hid
their
disdain
behind
a
mask
of
courtesy.
And
common
women
could
be
worse
than
either.
“Maidenpool
was
all
in
ruins
when
last
I
saw
it,”
she
said.
“The
gates
were
broken
and
half
the
town
was
burned.”

“They
rebuilt
it
some.
This
Tarly,
he’s
a
hard
man,
but
a
braver
lord
than
Mooton.
There’s
still
outlaws
in
the
woods,
but
not
so
many
as
there
was.
Tarly
hunted
down
the
worst
o’
them
and
shortened
them
with
that
big
sword
o’
his.”
He
turned
his
head
and
spat.
“You’ve
seen
no
outlaws
on
the
road?”

“None.”
Not
this
time.
The
farther
they
had
come
from
Duskendale,
the
emptier
the
road
had
been.
The
only
travelers
they’d
glimpsed
had
melted
away
into
the
woods
before
they
reached
them,
save
for
a
big,
bearded
septon
they
met
walking
south
with
twoscore
footsore
followers.
Such
inns
as
they
passed
had
either
been
sacked
and
abandoned
or
turned
into
armed
camps.
Yesterday
they
had
encountered
one
of
Lord
Randyll’s
patrols,
bristling
with
longbows
and
lances.
The
horsemen
had
surrounded
them
while
their
captain
questioned
Brienne,
but
in
the
end
he’d
let
them
continue
on
their
way.
“Be
wary,
woman.
The
next
men
you
meet
may
not
be
as
honest
as
my
lads.
The
Hound
has
crossed
the
Trident
with
a
hundred
outlaws,
and
it’s
said
they’re
raping
every
wench
they
come
upon
and
cutting
off
their
teats
for
trophies.”

Brienne
felt
obligated
to
pass
along
that
warning
to
the
farmer
and
his
wife.
The
man
nodded
as
she
told
him,
but
when
she
was
done
he
spat
again
and
said,
“Dogs
and
wolves
and
lions,
may
the
Others
take
them
all.
These
outlaws
won’t
dare
come
too
near
to
Maidenpool.
Not
so
long
as
Lord
Tarly
has
the
rule
there.”

Brienne
knew
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
from
her
time
with
King
Renly’s
host.
Though
she
could
not
find
it
in
herself
to
like
the
man,
she
could
not
forget
the
debt
she
owed
him
either.
If
the
gods
are
good,
we
will
pass
Maidenpool
before
he
knows
that
I
am
there.
“The
town
will
be
restored
to
Lord
Mooton
once
the
fighting’s
done,”
she
told
the
farmer.
“His
lordship
has
been
pardoned
by
the
king.”

“Pardoned?”
The
old
man
laughed.
“For
what?
Sitting
on
his
arse
in
his
bloody
castle?
He
sent
men
off
to
Riverrun
to
fight
but
never
went
himself.
Lions
sacked
his
town,
then
wolves,
then
sellswords,
and
his
lordship
just
sat
safe
behind
his
walls.
His
brother
’ud
never
have
hid
like
that.
Ser
Myles
was
bold
as
brass
till
that
Robert
killed
him.”

More
ghosts,
Brienne
thought.
“I
am
looking
for
my
sister,
a
fair
maid
of
three-and-ten.
Perhaps
you’ve
seen
her?”

“I’ve
not
seen
no
maids,
fair
nor
foul.”

No
one
has.
But
she
had
to
keep
asking.

“Mooton’s
daughter,
she’s
a
maid,”
the
man
went
on.
“Till
the
bedding,
anyways.
These
eggs,
they’re
for
her
wedding.
Her
and
Tarly’s
son.
The
cooks
will
need
eggs
for
cakes.”

“They
will.”
Lord
Tarly’s
son.
Young
Dickon’s
to
be
wed.
She
tried
to
recall
how
old
he
was;
eight
or
ten,
she
thought.
Brienne
had
been
betrothed
at
seven,
to
a
boy
three
years
her
senior,
Lord
Caron’s
younger
son,
a
shy
boy
with
a
mole
above
his
lip.
They
had
only
met
the
once,
on
the
occasion
of
their
betrothal.
Two
years
later
he
was
dead,
carried
off
by
the
same
chill
that
took
Lord
and
Lady
Caron
and
their
daughters.
Had
he
lived,
they
would
have
been
wed
within
a
year
of
her
first
flowering,
and
her
whole
life
would
have
been
different.
She
would
not
be
here
now,
dressed
in
man’s
mail
and
carrying
a
sword,
hunting
for
a
dead
woman’s
child.
More
like
she’d
be
at
Nightsong,
swaddling
a
child
of
her
own
and
nursing
another.
It
was
not
a
new
thought
for
Brienne.
It
always
made
her
feel
a
little
sad,
but
a
little
relieved
as
well.

The
sun
was
half-hidden
behind
a
bank
of
clouds
when
they
emerged
from
the
blackened
trees
to
find
Maidenpool
before
them,
with
the
deep
waters
of
the
bay
beyond.
The
town’s
gates
had
been
rebuilt
and
strengthened,
Brienne
saw
at
once,
and
crossbowmen
walked
its
pink
stone
walls
once
more.
Above
the
gatehouse
floated
King
Tommen’s
royal
banner,
a
black
stag
and
golden
lion
combatant
on
a
field
divided
gold
and
crimson.
Other
banners
displayed
the
Tarly
huntsman,
but
the
red
salmon
of
House
Mooton
flew
only
from
their
castle
on
its
hill.

At
the
portcullis
they
came
upon
a
dozen
guards
armed
with
halberds.
Their
badges
marked
them
for
soldiers
of
Lord
Tarly’s
host,
though
none
was
Tarly’s
own.
She
saw
two
centaurs,
a
thunderbolt,
a
blue
beetle
and
a
green
arrow,
but
not
the
striding
huntsman
of
Horn
Hill.
Their
serjeant
had
a
peacock
on
his
breast,
its
bright
tail
faded
by
the
sun.
When
the
farmers
drew
their
cart
up
he
gave
a
whistle.
“What’s
this
now?
Eggs?”
He
tossed
one
up,
caught
it,
and
grinned.
“We’ll
take
them.”

The
old
man
squawked.
“Our
eggs
is
for
Lord
Mooton.
For
the
wedding
cakes
and
such.”

“Have
your
hens
lay
more.
I
haven’t
had
an
egg
in
half
a
year.
Here,
don’t
say
you
weren’t
paid.”
He
flung
a
handful
of
pennies
at
the
old
man’s
feet.

The
farmer’s
wife
spoke
up.
“That’s
not
enough,”
she
said.
“Not
near
enough.”

“I
say
it
is,”
said
the
serjeant.
“For
them
eggs,
and
you
as
well.
Bring
her
here,
boys.
She’s
too
young
for
that
old
man.”
Two
of
the
guards
leaned
their
halberds
against
the
wall
and
pulled
the
woman
away
from
the
cart,
struggling.
The
farmer
watched
grey-faced,
but
dared
not
move.

Brienne
spurred
her
mare
forward.
“Release
her.”

Her
voice
made
the
guards
hesitate
long
enough
for
the
farmer’s
wife
to
wrench
free
of
their
grasp.
“This
is
none
of
your
concern,”
one
man
said.
“You
mind
your
mouth,
wench.”

Brienne
drew
her
sword
instead.

“Well
now,”
the
serjeant
said,
“naked
steel.
Seems
to
me
I
smell
an
outlaw.
You
know
what
Lord
Tarly
does
with
outlaws?”
He
still
held
the
egg
he’d
taken
from
the
cart.
His
hand
closed,
and
the
yolk
oozed
through
his
fingers.

“I
know
what
Lord
Randyll
does
with
outlaws,”
Brienne
said.
“I
know
what
he
does
with
rapers
too.”

She
had
hoped
the
name
might
cow
them,
but
the
serjeant
only
flicked
egg
off
his
fingers
and
signaled
to
his
men
to
spread
out.
Brienne
found
herself
surrounded
by
steel
points.
“What
was
it
you
was
saying,
wench?
What
is
it
that
Lord
Tarly
does
to...”

“...rapers,”
a
deeper
voice
finished.
“He
gelds
them
or
sends
them
to
the
Wall.
Sometimes
both.
And
he
cuts
fingers
off
thieves.”
A
languid
young
man
stepped
from
the
gatehouse,
a
swordbelt
buckled
at
his
waist.
The
surcoat
he
wore
above
his
steel
had
once
been
white,
and
here
and
there
still
was,
beneath
the
grass
stains
and
dried
blood.
His
sigil
was
displayed
across
his
chest:
a
brown
deer,
dead
and
bound
and
slung
beneath
a
pole.

Him.
His
voice
was
a
punch
in
her
stomach,
his
face
a
blade
in
her
bowels.
“Ser
Hyle,”
she
said
stiffly.

“Best
let
her
by,
lads,”
warned
Ser
Hyle
Hunt.
“This
is
Brienne
the
Beauty,
the
Maid
of
Tarth,
who
slew
King
Renly
and
half
his
Rainbow
Guard.
She’s
as
mean
as
she
is
ugly,
and
there’s
no
one
uglier...
except
perhaps
for
you,
Pisspot,
but
your
father
was
the
rear
end
of
an
aurochs,
so
you
have
a
good
excuse.
Her
father
is
the
Evenstar
of
Tarth.”

The
guards
laughed,
but
the
halberds
parted.
“Shouldn’t
we
seize
her,
ser?”
the
serjeant
asked.
“For
killing
Renly?”

“Why?
Renly
was
a
rebel.
So
were
we
all,
rebels
to
a
man,
but
now
we’re
Tommen’s
loyal
lads.”
The
knight
waved
the
farm
folk
through
the
gate.
“His
lordship’s
steward
will
be
pleased
to
see
those
eggs.
You’ll
find
him
in
the
market.”

The
old
man
knuckled
his
forehead.
“My
thanks,
m’lord.
You’re
a
true
knight,
it’s
plain
to
see.
Come,
wife.”
They
put
their
shoulders
to
the
cart
again
and
rumbled
through
the
gate.

Brienne
trotted
after
them,
with
Podrick
at
her
heels.
A
true
knight,
she
thought,
frowning.
Inside
the
town
she
reined
up.
The
ruins
of
a
stable
could
be
seen
off
to
her
left,
fronting
on
a
muddy
alley.
Across
from
it
three
half-dressed
whores
stood
on
the
balcony
of
a
brothel,
whispering
to
one
another.
One
looked
a
bit
like
a
camp
follower
who
had
once
come
up
to
Brienne
to
ask
if
she
had
a
cunt
or
a
cock
inside
her
breeches.

“That
rounsey
may
be
the
most
hideous
horse
I’ve
ever
seen,”
said
Ser
Hyle
of
Podrick’s
mount.
“I
am
surprised
that
you’re
not
riding
it,
my
lady.
Do
you
plan
to
thank
me
for
my
help?”

Brienne
swung
down
off
her
mare.
She
stood
a
head
taller
than
Ser
Hyle.
“One
day
I’ll
thank
you
in
a
mêlée,
ser.”

“The
way
you
thanked
Red
Ronnet?”
Hunt
laughed.
He
had
a
full,
rich
laugh,
though
his
face
was
plain.
An
honest
face,
she’d
thought
once,
before
she
learned
better;
shaggy
brown
hair,
hazel
eyes,
a
little
scar
by
his
left
ear.
His
chin
had
a
cleft
and
his
nose
was
crooked,
but
he
did
laugh
well,
and
often.

“Shouldn’t
you
be
watching
your
gate?”

He
made
a
wry
face
at
her.
“My
cousin
Alyn
is
off
hunting
outlaws.
Doubtless
he’ll
return
with
the
Hound’s
head,
gloating
and
covered
in
glory.
Meanwhile,
I
am
condemned
to
guard
this
gate,
thanks
to
you.
I
hope
you’re
pleased,
my
beauty.
What
is
it
that
you’re
looking
for?”

“A
stable.”

“Over
by
the
east
gate.
This
one
burned.”

I
can
see
that.
“What
you
said
to
those
men...
I
was
with
King
Renly
when
he
died,
but
it
was
some
sorcery
that
slew
him,
ser.
I
swear
it
on
my
sword.”
She
put
her
hand
upon
her
hilt,
ready
to
fight
if
Hunt
named
her
a
liar
to
her
face.

“Aye,
and
it
was
the
Knight
of
Flowers
who
carved
up
the
Rainbow
Guard.
On
a
good
day
you
might
have
been
able
to
defeat
Ser
Emmon.
He
was
a
rash
fighter,
and
he
tired
easily.
Royce,
though?
No.
Ser
Robar
was
twice
the
swordsman
that
you
are...
though
you’re
not
a
swordsman,
are
you?
Is
there
such
a
word
as
swordswench?
What
quest
brings
the
Maid
to
Maidenpool,
I
wonder?”

Searching
for
my
sister,
a
maid
of
three-and-ten,
she
almost
said,
but
Ser
Hyle
would
know
she
had
no
sisters.
“There’s
a
man
I
seek,
at
a
place
called
the
Stinking
Goose.”

“I
thought
Brienne
the
Beauty
had
no
use
for
men.”
There
was
a
cruel
edge
to
his
smile.
“The
Stinking
Goose.
An
apt
name,
that...
the
stinking
part,
at
least.
It’s
by
the
harbor.
First
you
will
come
with
me
to
see
his
lordship.”

Brienne
did
not
fear
Ser
Hyle,
but
he
was
one
of
Randyll
Tarly’s
captains.
A
whistle,
and
a
hundred
men
would
come
running
to
defend
him.
“Am
I
to
be
arrested?”

“What,
for
Renly?
Who
was
he?
We’ve
changed
kings
since
then,
some
of
us
twice.
No
one
cares,
no
one
remembers.”
He
laid
a
hand
lightly
on
her
arm.
“This
way,
if
you
please.”

She
wrenched
away.
“I
would
thank
you
not
to
touch
me.”

“Thanks
at
last,”
he
said,
with
a
wry
smile.

When
last
she
had
seen
Maidenpool,
the
town
had
been
a
desolation,
a
grim
place
of
empty
streets
and
burned
homes.
Now
the
streets
were
full
of
pigs
and
children,
and
most
of
the
burned
buildings
had
been
pulled
down.
Vegetables
had
been
planted
in
the
lots
where
some
once
stood;
merchant’s
tents
and
knight’s
pavilions
took
the
place
of
others.
Brienne
saw
new
houses
going
up,
a
stone
inn
rising
where
a
wooden
inn
had
burned,
a
new
slate
roof
on
the
town
sept.
The
cool
autumn
air
rang
to
the
sounds
of
saw
and
hammer.
Men
carried
timber
through
the
streets,
and
quarrymen
drove
their
wagons
down
muddy
lanes.
Many
wore
the
striding
huntsman
on
their
breasts.
“The
soldiers
are
rebuilding
the
town,”
she
said,
surprised.

“They
would
sooner
be
dicing,
drinking,
and
fucking,
I
don’t
doubt,
but
Lord
Randyll
believes
in
putting
idle
men
to
work.”

She
had
expected
to
be
taken
to
the
castle.
Instead,
Hunt
led
them
toward
the
busy
harbor.
The
traders
had
returned
to
Maidenpool,
she
was
pleased
to
see.
A
galley,
a
galleas,
and
a
big
two-masted
cog
were
in
port,
along
with
a
score
of
little
fishing
boats.
More
fishermen
were
visible
out
on
the
bay.
If
the
Stinking
Goose
yields
nothing,
I
will
take
passage
on
a
ship,
she
decided.
Gulltown
was
only
a
short
voyage
away.
From
there
she
could
make
her
way
to
the
Eyrie
easily
enough.

They
found
Lord
Tarly
in
the
fishmarket,
doing
justice.

A
platform
had
been
thrown
up
beside
the
water,
from
which
his
lordship
could
look
down
upon
the
men
accused
of
crimes.
To
his
left
stood
a
long
gallows,
with
ropes
enough
for
twenty
men.
Four
corpses
swung
beneath
it.
One
looked
fresh,
but
the
other
three
had
plainly
been
there
for
some
time.
A
crow
was
pulling
strips
of
flesh
from
the
ripe
ruins
of
one
of
the
dead
men.
The
other
crows
had
scattered,
wary
of
the
crowd
of
townsfolk
who’d
gathered
in
hopes
of
someone’s
being
hanged.

Lord
Randyll
shared
the
platform
with
Lord
Mooton,
a
pale,
soft,
fleshy
man
in
a
white
doublet
and
red
breeches,
his
ermine
cloak
pinned
at
the
shoulder
by
a
red-gold
brooch
in
the
shape
of
a
salmon.
Tarly
wore
mail
and
boiled
leather,
and
a
breastplate
of
grey
steel.
The
hilt
of
a
greatsword
poked
up
above
his
left
shoulder.
Heartsbane,
it
was
named,
the
pride
of
his
House.

A
stripling
in
a
roughspun
cloak
and
soiled
jerkin
was
being
heard
when
they
came
up.
“I
never
hurt
no
one,
m’lord,”
Brienne
heard
him
say.
“I
only
took
what
the
septons
left
when
they
run
off.
If
you
got
to
take
my
finger
for
that,
do
it.”

“It
is
customary
to
take
a
finger
from
a
thief,”
Lord
Tarly
replied
in
a
hard
voice,
“but
a
man
who
steals
from
a
sept
is
stealing
from
the
gods.”
He
turned
to
his
captain
of
guards.
“Seven
fingers.
Leave
his
thumbs.”

“Seven?”
The
thief
paled.
When
the
guards
seized
hold
of
him
he
tried
to
fight,
but
feebly,
as
if
he
were
already
maimed.
Watching
him,
Brienne
could
not
help
think
of
Ser
Jaime,
and
the
way
he’d
screamed
when
Zollo’s
arakh
came
flashing
down.

The
next
man
was
a
baker,
accused
of
mixing
sawdust
in
his
flour.
Lord
Randyll
fined
him
fifty
silver
stags.
When
the
baker
swore
he
did
not
have
that
much
silver,
his
lordship
declared
that
he
could
have
a
lash
for
every
stag
that
he
was
short.
He
was
followed
by
a
haggard
grey-faced
whore,
accused
of
giving
the
pox
to
four
of
Tarly’s
soldiers.
“Wash
out
her
private
parts
with
lye
and
throw
her
in
a
dungeon,”
Tarly
commanded.
As
the
whore
was
dragged
off
sobbing,
his
lordship
saw
Brienne
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd,
standing
between
Podrick
and
Ser
Hyle.
He
frowned
at
her,
but
his
eyes
betrayed
not
a
flicker
of
recognition.

A
sailor
off
the
galleas
came
next.
His
accuser
was
an
archer
of
Lord
Mooton’s
garrison,
with
a
bandaged
hand
and
a
salmon
on
his
breast.
“If
it
please
m’lord,
this
bastid
put
his
dagger
through
my
hand.
He
said
I
was
cheating
him
at
dice.”

Lord
Tarly
took
his
gaze
away
from
Brienne
to
consider
the
men
before
him.
“Were
you?”

“No,
m’lord.
I
never.”

“For
theft,
I
will
take
a
finger.
Lie
to
me
and
I
will
hang
you.
Shall
I
ask
to
see
these
dice?”

“The
dice?”
The
archer
looked
to
Mooton,
but
his
lordship
was
gazing
at
the
fishing
boats.
The
bowman
swallowed.
“Might
be
I...
them
dice,
they’re
lucky
for
me,
’s
true,
but
I...”

Tarly
had
heard
enough.
“Take
his
little
finger.
He
can
choose
which
hand.
A
nail
through
the
palm
for
the
other.”
He
stood.
“We’re
done.
March
the
rest
of
them
back
to
the
dungeon,
I’ll
deal
with
them
on
the
morrow.”
He
turned
to
beckon
Ser
Hyle
forward.
Brienne
followed.
“My
lord,”
she
said,
when
she
stood
before
him.
She
felt
eight
years
old
again.

“My
lady.
To
what
do
we
owe
this...
honor?”

“I
have
been
sent
to
look
for...
for...”
She
hesitated.

“How
will
you
find
him
if
you
do
not
know
his
name?
Did
you
slay
Lord
Renly?”

“No.”

Tarly
weighed
the
word.
He
is
judging
me,
as
he
judged
those
others.
“No,”
he
said
at
last,
“you
only
let
him
die.”

He
had
died
in
her
arms,
his
life’s
blood
drenching
her.
Brienne
flinched.
“It
was
sorcery.
I
never...”

“You
never?”
His
voice
became
a
whip.
“Aye.
You
never
should
have
donned
mail,
nor
buckled
on
a
sword.
You
never
should
have
left
your
father’s
hall.
This
is
a
war,
not
a
harvest
ball.
By
all
the
gods,
I
ought
to
ship
you
back
to
Tarth.”

“Do
that
and
answer
to
the
throne.”
Her
voice
sounded
high
and
girlish,
when
she
wanted
to
sound
fearless.
“Podrick.
In
my
bag
you’ll
find
a
parchment.
Bring
it
to
his
lordship.”

Tarly
took
the
letter
and
unrolled
it,
scowling.
His
lips
moved
as
he
read.
“The
king’s
business.
What
sort
of
business?”

Lie
to
me
and
I
will
hang
you.
“S-sansa
Stark.”

“If
the
Stark
girl
were
here,
I’d
know
it.
She’s
run
back
north,
I’ll
wager.
Hoping
to
find
refuge
with
one
of
her
father’s
bannermen.
She
had
best
hope
she
chooses
the
right
one.”

“She
might
have
gone
to
the
Vale
instead,”
Brienne
heard
herself
blurt
out,
“to
her
mother’s
sister.”

Lord
Randyll
gave
her
a
contemptuous
look.
“Lady
Lysa
is
dead.
Some
singer
pushed
her
off
a
mountain.
Littlefinger
holds
the
Eyrie
now...
though
not
for
long.
The
lords
of
the
Vale
are
not
the
sort
to
bend
their
knees
to
some
upjumped
jackanapes
whose
only
skill
is
counting
coppers.”
He
handed
her
back
her
letter.
“Go
where
you
want
and
do
as
you
will...
but
when
you’re
raped
don’t
look
to
me
for
justice.
You
will
have
earned
it
with
your
folly.”
He
glanced
at
Ser
Hyle.
“And
you,
ser,
should
be
at
your
gate.
I
gave
you
the
command
there,
did
I
not?”

“You
did,
my
lord,”
said
Hyle
Hunt,
“but
I
thought—”

“You
think
too
much.”
Lord
Tarly
strode
away.

Lysa
Tully
is
dead.
Brienne
stood
beneath
the
gallows,
the
precious
parchment
in
her
hand.
The
crowd
had
dispersed,
and
the
crows
had
returned
to
resume
their
feast.
A
singer
pushed
her
off
a
mountain.
Had
the
crows
dined
on
Lady
Catelyn’s
sister
too?

“You
spoke
of
the
Stinking
Goose,
my
lady,”
said
Ser
Hyle.
“If
you
want
me
to
show
you—”

“Go
back
to
your
gate.”

A
look
of
annoyance
flashed
across
his
face.
A
plain
face,
not
an
honest
one.
“If
that’s
your
wish.”

“It
is.”

“It
was
only
a
game
to
pass
the
time.
We
meant
no
harm.”
He
hesitated.
“Ben
died,
you
know.
Cut
down
on
the
Blackwater.
Farrow
too,
and
Will
the
Stork.
And
Mark
Mullendore
took
a
wound
that
cost
him
half
his
arm.”

Good,
Brienne
wanted
to
say.
Good,
he
deserved
it.
But
she
remembered
Mullendore
sitting
outside
his
pavilion
with
his
monkey
on
his
shoulder
in
a
little
suit
of
chainmail,
the
two
of
them
making
faces
at
each
other.
What
was
it
Catelyn
Stark
had
called
them,
that
night
at
Bitterbridge?
The
knights
of
summer.
And
now
it
was
autumn
and
they
were
falling
like
leaves...

She
turned
her
back
on
Hyle
Hunt.
“Podrick,
come.”

The
boy
trotted
after
her,
leading
their
horses.
“Are
we
going
to
find
the
place?
The
Stinking
Goose?”

“I
am.
You
are
going
to
the
stables,
by
the
east
gate.
Ask
the
stableman
if
there’s
an
inn
where
we
can
spend
the
night.”

“I
will,
ser.
My
lady.”
Podrick
stared
at
the
ground
as
they
went,
kicking
stones
from
time
to
time.
“Do
you
know
where
it
is?
The
Goose?
The
Stinking
Goose,
I
mean.”

“No.”

“He
said
he’d
show
us.
That
knight.
Ser
Kyle.”

“Hyle.”

“Hyle.
What
did
he
do
to
you,
ser?
I
mean,
my
lady.”

The
boy
may
be
a
stumbletongue,
but
he’s
not
stupid.
“At
Highgarden,
when
King
Renly
called
his
banners,
some
men
played
a
game
with
me.
Ser
Hyle
was
one
of
them.
It
was
a
cruel
game,
hurtful
and
unchivalrous.”
She
stopped.
“The
east
gate
is
that
way.
Wait
for
me
there.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady.
Ser.”

No
sign
marked
the
Stinking
Goose.
It
took
her
most
of
an
hour
to
find
it,
down
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
beneath
a
knacker’s
barn.
The
cellar
was
dim
and
the
ceiling
low,
and
Brienne
thumped
her
head
on
a
beam
as
she
entered.
No
geese
were
in
evidence.
A
few
stools
were
scattered
about,
and
a
bench
had
been
shoved
up
against
one
earthen
wall.
The
tables
were
old
wine
casks,
grey
and
wormholed.
The
promised
stink
pervaded
everything.
Mostly
it
was
wine
and
damp
and
mildew,
her
nose
told
her,
but
there
was
a
little
of
the
privy
too,
and
something
of
the
lichyard.

The
only
drinkers
were
three
Tyroshi
seamen
in
a
corner,
growling
at
each
other
through
green
and
purple
beards.
They
gave
her
a
brief
inspection,
and
one
said
something
that
made
the
others
laugh.
The
proprietor
stood
behind
a
plank
that
had
been
placed
across
two
barrels.
She
was
a
woman,
round
and
pale
and
balding,
with
huge
soft
breasts
swaying
beneath
a
soiled
smock.
She
looked
as
though
the
gods
had
made
her
out
of
uncooked
dough.

Brienne
did
not
dare
to
ask
for
water
here.
She
bought
a
cup
of
wine
and
said,
“I
am
looking
for
a
man
called
Nimble
Dick.”

“Dick
Crabb.
Comes
in
most
every
night.”
The
woman
eyed
Brienne’s
mail
and
sword.
“If
you’re
going
to
cut
him,
do
it
somewheres
else.
We
don’t
want
no
trouble
with
Lord
Tarly.”

“I
want
to
talk
with
him.
Why
would
I
do
him
harm?”

The
woman
shrugged.

“If
you
would
nod
when
he
comes
in
I’d
be
thankful.”

“How
thankful?”

Brienne
put
a
copper
star
on
the
plank
between
them
and
found
a
place
in
the
shadows
with
a
good
view
of
the
steps.

She
tried
the
wine.
It
was
oily
on
the
tongue
and
there
was
a
hair
floating
in
it.
A
hair
as
slender
as
my
hopes
of
finding
Sansa,
she
thought
as
she
plucked
it
out.
Chasing
after
Ser
Dontos
had
been
fruitless,
and
with
Lady
Lysa
dead
the
Vale
no
longer
seemed
a
likely
refuge.
Where
are
you,
Lady
Sansa?
Did
you
run
home
to
Winterfell,
or
are
you
with
your
husband,
as
Podrick
seems
to
think?
Brienne
did
not
want
to
chase
the
girl
across
the
narrow
sea,
where
even
the
language
would
be
strange
to
her.
I
will
be
even
more
a
freak
there,
grunting
and
gesturing
to
make
myself
understood.
They
will
laugh
at
me,
as
they
laughed
at
Highgarden.
A
blush
stole
up
her
cheeks
as
she
remembered.

When
Renly
donned
his
crown,
the
Maid
of
Tarth
had
ridden
all
the
way
across
the
Reach
to
join
him.
The
king
himself
had
greeted
her
courteously
and
welcomed
her
to
his
service.
Not
so
his
lords
and
knights.
Brienne
had
not
expected
a
warm
welcome.
She
was
prepared
for
coldness,
for
mockery,
for
hostility.
She
had
supped
upon
such
meat
before.
It
was
not
the
scorn
of
the
many
that
left
her
confused
and
vulnerable,
but
the
kindness
of
the
few.
The
Maid
of
Tarth
had
been
betrothed
three
times,
but
she
had
never
been
courted
until
she
came
to
Highgarden.

Big
Ben
Bushy
was
the
first,
one
of
the
few
men
in
Renly’s
camp
who
overtopped
her.
He
sent
his
squire
to
her
to
clean
her
mail,
and
made
her
a
gift
of
a
silver
drinking
horn.
Ser
Edmund
Ambrose
went
him
one
better,
bringing
flowers
and
asking
her
to
ride
with
him.
Ser
Hyle
Hunt
outdid
them
both.
He
gave
her
a
book,
beautifully
illuminated
and
filled
with
a
hundred
tales
of
knightly
valor.
He
brought
apples
and
carrots
for
her
horses,
and
a
blue
silk
plume
for
her
helm.
He
told
her
the
gossip
of
the
camp
and
said
clever,
cutting
things
that
made
her
smile.
He
even
trained
with
her
one
day,
which
meant
more
than
all
the
rest.

She
thought
it
was
because
of
him
that
the
others
started
being
courteous.
More
than
courteous.
At
table
men
fought
for
the
place
beside
her,
offering
to
fill
her
wine
cup
or
fetch
her
sweetbreads.
Ser
Richard
Farrow
played
love
songs
on
his
lute
outside
her
pavilion.
Ser
Hugh
Beesbury
brought
her
a
pot
of
honey
“as
sweet
as
the
maids
of
Tarth.”
Ser
Mark
Mullendore
made
her
laugh
with
the
antics
of
his
monkey,
a
curious
little
black-and-white
creature
from
the
Summer
Islands.
A
hedge
knight
called
Will
the
Stork
offered
to
rub
the
knots
from
her
shoulders.

Brienne
refused
him.
She
refused
them
all.
When
Ser
Owen
Inchfield
seized
her
one
night
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her,
she
knocked
him
arse-backwards
into
a
cookfire.
Afterward
she
looked
at
herself
in
a
glass.
Her
face
was
as
broad
and
bucktoothed
and
freckled
as
ever,
big-lipped,
thick
of
jaw,
so
ugly.
All
she
wanted
was
to
be
a
knight
and
serve
King
Renly,
yet
now...

It
was
not
as
if
she
were
the
only
woman
there.
Even
the
camp
followers
were
prettier
than
she
was,
and
up
in
the
castle
Lord
Tyrell
feasted
King
Renly
every
night,
whilst
highborn
maids
and
lovely
ladies
danced
to
the
music
of
pipe
and
horn
and
harp.
Why
are
you
being
kind
to
me?
she
wanted
to
scream,
every
time
some
strange
knight
paid
her
a
compliment.
What
do
you
want?

Randyll
Tarly
solved
the
mystery
the
day
he
sent
two
of
his
men-at-arms
to
summon
her
to
his
pavilion.
His
young
son
Dickon
had
overheard
four
knights
laughing
as
they
saddled
up
their
horses,
and
had
told
his
lord
father
what
they
said.

They
had
a
wager.

Three
of
the
younger
knights
had
started
it,
he
told
her:
Ambrose,
Bushy,
and
Hyle
Hunt,
of
his
own
household.
As
word
spread
through
the
camp,
however,
others
had
joined
the
game.
Each
man
was
required
to
buy
into
the
contest
with
a
golden
dragon,
the
whole
sum
to
go
to
whoever
claimed
her
maidenhead.

“I
have
put
an
end
to
their
sport,”
Tarly
told
her.
“Some
of
these...
challengers...
are
less
honorable
than
others,
and
the
stakes
were
growing
larger
every
day.
It
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
one
of
them
decided
to
claim
the
prize
by
force.”

“They
were
knights,”
she
said,
stunned,
“anointed
knights.”

“And
honorable
men.
The
blame
is
yours.”

The
accusation
made
her
flinch.
“I
would
never...
my
lord,
I
did
nought
to
encourage
them.”

“Your
being
here
encouraged
them.
If
a
woman
will
behave
like
a
camp
follower,
she
cannot
object
to
being
treated
like
one.
A
war
host
is
no
place
for
a
maiden.
If
you
have
any
regard
for
your
virtue
or
the
honor
of
your
House,
you
will
take
off
that
mail,
return
home,
and
beg
your
father
to
find
a
husband
for
you.”

“I
came
to
fight,”
she
insisted.
“To
be
a
knight.”

“The
gods
made
men
to
fight,
and
women
to
bear
children,”
said
Randyll
Tarly.
“A
woman’s
war
is
in
the
birthing
bed.”

Someone
was
coming
down
the
cellar
steps.
Brienne
pushed
her
wine
aside
as
a
ragged,
scrawny,
sharp-faced
man
with
dirty
brown
hair
stepped
into
the
Goose.
He
gave
the
Tyroshi
sailors
a
quick
look
and
Brienne
a
longer
one,
then
went
up
to
the
plank.
“Wine,”
he
said,
“and
none
o’
your
horse
piss
in
it,
thank’e.”

The
woman
gave
Brienne
a
look
and
nodded.

“I’ll
buy
your
wine,”
she
called
out,
“for
a
word.”

The
man
looked
her
over,
his
eyes
wary.
“A
word?
I
know
a
lot
o’
words.”
He
sat
down
on
the
stool
across
from
her.
“Tell
me
which
m’lady
wants
t’
hear,
and
Nimble
Dick
will
say
it.”

“I
heard
you
fooled
a
fool.”

The
ragged
man
sipped
his
wine,
thinking.
“Mighten
be
I
did.
Or
not.”
He
wore
a
faded,
torn
doublet
from
which
some
lord’s
badge
had
been
ripped.
“Who
is
it
wants
t’
know?”

“King
Robert.”
She
put
a
silver
stag
on
the
barrel
between
them.
Robert’s
head
was
on
one
side,
the
stag
on
the
other.

“Does
he
now?”
The
man
took
the
coin
and
spun
it,
smiling.
“I
like
to
see
a
king
dance,
hey-nonny
hey-nonny
hey-nonny-ho.
Mighten
be
I
saw
this
fool
of
yours.”

“Was
there
a
girl
with
him?”

“Two
girls,”
he
said
at
once.

“Two
girls?”
Could
the
other
one
be
Arya?

“Well,”
the
man
said,
“I
never
seen
the
little
sweets,
mind
you,
but
he
was
wanting
passage
for
three.”

“Passage
where?”

“T’other
side
o’
the
sea,
as
I
recall.”

“Do
you
remember
what
he
looked
like?”

“A
fool.”
He
snatched
the
spinning
coin
off
the
table
as
it
began
to
slow,
and
made
it
vanish.
“A
frightened
fool.”

“Frightened
why?”

He
shrugged.
“He
never
said,
but
old
Nimble
Dick
knows
the
smell
o’
fear.
He
come
here
most
every
night,
buying
drinks
for
sailors,
making
japes,
singing
little
songs.
Only
one
night
some
men
come
in
with
that
hunter
on
their
teats,
and
your
fool
went
white
as
milk
and
got
quiet
till
they
left.”
He
edged
his
stool
closer
to
hers.
“That
Tarly’s
got
soldiers
crawling
over
the
docks,
watching
every
ship
that
comes
or
goes.
Man
wants
a
deer,
he
goes
t’
the
woods.
He
wants
a
ship,
he
goes
t’
the
docks.
Your
fool
didn’t
dare.
So
I
offered
him
some
help.”

“What
sort
of
help?”

“The
sort
that
costs
more
than
one
silver
stag.”

“Tell
me,
and
you’ll
have
another.”

“Let’s
see
it,”
he
said.
She
put
another
stag
on
the
barrel.
He
spun
it,
smiled,
scooped
it
up.
“A
man
who
can’t
go
t’
the
ships
need
for
the
ships
t’
come
t’
him.
I
told
him
I
knew
a
place
where
that
might
happen.
A
hidden
place,
like.”

Gooseprickles
rose
along
Brienne’s
arms.
“A
smugglers’
cove.
You
sent
the
fool
to
smugglers.”

“Him
and
them
two
girls.”
He
chuckled.
“Only
thing,
well,
the
place
I
sent
them,
been
no
ships
there
for
a
while.
Thirty
years,
say.”
He
scratched
his
nose.
“What’s
this
fool
to
you?”

“Those
two
girls
are
my
sisters.”

“Are
they,
now?
Poor
little
things.
Had
a
sister
once
meself.
Skinny
girl
with
knobby
knees,
but
then
she
grew
a
pair
o’
teats
and
a
knight’s
son
got
between
her
legs.
Last
I
saw
her
she
was
off
for
King’s
Landing
t’
make
a
living
on
her
back.”

“Where
did
you
send
them?”

Another
shrug.
“As
t’
that,
I
can’t
recall.”

“Where?”
Brienne
slapped
another
silver
stag
down.

He
flicked
the
coin
back
at
her
with
his
forefinger.
“Someplace
no
stag
ever
found...
though
a
dragon
might.”

Silver
would
not
get
the
truth
from
him,
she
sensed.
Gold
might,
or
it
might
not.
Steel
would
be
more
certain.
Brienne
touched
her
dagger,
then
reached
into
her
purse
instead.
She
found
a
golden
dragon
and
put
in
on
the
barrel.
“Where?”

The
ragged
man
snatched
up
the
coin
and
bit
it.
“Sweet.
Puts
me
in
mind
o’
Crackclaw
Point.
Up
north
o’
here,
’tis
a
wild
land
o’
hills
and
bogs,
but
it
happens
I
was
born
and
bred
there.
Dick
Crabb,
I’m
named,
though
most
call
me
Nimble
Dick.”

She
did
not
offer
her
own
name.
“Where
in
Crackclaw
Point?”

“The
Whispers.
You
heard
o’
Clarence
Crabb,
o’
course.”

“No.”

That
seemed
to
surprise
him.
“Ser
Clarence
Crabb,
I
said.
I
got
his
blood
in
me.
He
was
eight
foot
tall,
and
so
strong
he
could
uproot
pine
trees
with
one
hand
and
chuck
them
half
a
mile.
No
horse
could
bear
his
weight,
so
he
rode
an
aurochs.”

“What
does
he
have
to
do
with
this
smugglers’
cove?”

“His
wife
was
a
woods
witch.
Whenever
Ser
Clarence
killed
a
man,
he’d
fetch
his
head
back
home
and
his
wife
would
kiss
it
on
the
lips
and
bring
it
back
t’
life.
Lords,
they
were,
and
wizards,
and
famous
knights
and
pirates.
One
was
king
o’
Duskendale.
They
gave
old
Crabb
good
counsel.
Being
they
was
just
heads,
they
couldn’t
talk
real
loud,
but
they
never
shut
up
neither.
When
you’re
a
head,
talking’s
all
you
got
to
pass
the
day.
So
Crabb’s
keep
got
named
the
Whispers.
Still
is,
though
it’s
been
a
ruin
for
a
thousand
years.
A
lonely
place,
the
Whispers.”
The
man
walked
the
coin
deftly
across
his
knuckles.
“One
dragon
by
hisself
gets
lonely.
Ten,
now...”

“Ten
dragons
are
a
fortune.
Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?”

“No,
but
I
can
take
you
to
one.”
The
coin
danced
one
way,
and
back
the
other.
“Take
you
to
the
Whispers,
m’lady.”

Brienne
did
not
like
the
way
his
fingers
played
with
that
gold
coin.
Still...
“Six
dragons
if
we
find
my
sister.
Two
if
we
only
find
the
fool.
Nothing
if
nothing
is
what
we
find.”

Crabb
shrugged.
“Six
is
good.
Six
will
serve.”

Too
quick.
She
caught
his
wrist
before
he
could
tuck
the
gold
away.
“Do
not
play
me
false.
You’ll
not
find
me
easy
meat.”

When
she
let
go,
Crabb
rubbed
his
wrist.
“Bloody
piss,”
he
muttered.
“You
hurt
my
hand.”

“I
am
sorry
for
that.
My
sister
is
a
girl
of
three-and-ten.
I
need
to
find
her
before—”

“—before
some
knight
gets
in
her
slit.
Aye,
I
hear
you.
She’s
good
as
saved.
Nimble
Dick
is
with
you
now.
Meet
me
by
east
gate
at
first
light.
I
need
t’
see
this
man
about
a
horse.”





SAMWELL

The
sea
made
Samwell
Tarly
greensick.

It
was
not
all
his
fear
of
drowning,
though
that
was
surely
some
of
it.
It
was
the
motion
of
the
ship
as
well,
the
way
the
decks
rolled
beneath
his
feet.
“I
have
a
queasy
belly,”
he
confessed
to
Dareon
the
day
they
sailed
from
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
The
singer
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
said,
“With
a
belly
big
as
yours,
Slayer,
that
is
a
lot
of
quease.”

Sam
tried
to
keep
a
brave
face
on
him,
for
Gilly’s
sake
if
little
else.
She
had
never
seen
the
sea
before.
When
they
were
struggling
through
the
snows
after
fleeing
Craster’s
Keep,
they
had
come
on
several
lakes,
and
even
those
had
been
a
wonder
to
her.
As
Blackbird
slipped
away
from
shore
the
girl
began
to
tremble,
and
big
salt
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks.
“Gods
be
good,”
Sam
heard
her
whisper.
Eastwatch
vanished
first,
and
the
Wall
grew
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance,
until
it
finally
disappeared.
The
wind
was
coming
up
by
then.
The
sails
were
the
faded
grey
of
a
black
cloak
that
had
been
washed
too
often,
and
Gilly’s
face
was
white
with
fear.
“This
is
a
good
ship,”
Sam
tried
to
tell
her.
“You
don’t
have
to
be
afraid.”
But
she
only
looked
at
him,
held
her
baby
tighter,
and
fled
below.

Sam
soon
found
himself
clutching
tightly
to
the
gunwale
and
watching
the
sweep
of
the
oars.
The
way
they
all
moved
together
was
somehow
beautiful
to
behold,
and
better
than
looking
at
the
water.
Looking
at
the
water
only
made
him
think
of
drowning.
When
he
was
small
his
lord
father
had
tried
to
teach
him
how
to
swim
by
throwing
him
into
the
pond
beneath
Horn
Hill.
The
water
had
gotten
in
his
nose
and
in
his
mouth
and
in
his
lungs,
and
he
coughed
and
wheezed
for
hours
after
Ser
Hyle
pulled
him
out.
After
that
he
never
dared
go
in
any
deeper
than
his
waist.

The
Bay
of
Seals
was
a
lot
deeper
than
his
waist,
and
not
so
friendly
as
that
little
fishpond
below
his
father’s
castle.
Its
waters
were
grey
and
green
and
choppy,
and
the
wooded
shore
they
followed
was
a
snarl
of
rocks
and
whirlpools.
Even
if
he
could
kick
and
crawl
that
far
somehow,
the
waves
were
like
to
smash
him
up
against
some
stone
and
break
his
head
to
pieces.

“Looking
for
mermaids,
Slayer?”
asked
Dareon
when
he
saw
Sam
staring
off
across
the
bay.
Fair-haired
and
hazel-eyed,
the
handsome
young
singer
out
of
Eastwatch
looked
more
like
some
dark
prince
than
a
black
brother.

“No.”
Sam
did
not
know
what
he
was
looking
for,
or
what
he
was
doing
on
this
boat.
Going
to
the
Citadel
to
forge
a
chain
and
be
a
maester,
to
be
of
better
service
to
the
Watch,
he
told
himself,
but
the
thought
just
made
him
weary.
He
did
not
want
to
be
a
maester,
with
a
heavy
chain
wrapped
around
his
neck,
cold
against
his
skin.
He
did
not
want
to
leave
his
brothers,
the
only
friends
he’d
ever
had.
And
he
certainly
did
not
want
to
face
the
father
who
had
sent
him
to
the
Wall
to
die.

It
was
different
for
the
others.
For
them,
the
voyage
would
have
a
happy
ending.
Gilly
would
be
safe
at
Horn
Hill,
with
all
the
width
of
West-eros
between
her
and
the
horrors
she
had
known
in
the
haunted
forest.
As
a
serving
maid
in
his
father’s
castle,
she
would
be
warm
and
well
fed,
a
small
part
of
a
great
world
she
could
never
have
dreamed
of
as
Craster’s
wife.
She
would
watch
her
son
grow
up
big
and
strong,
and
become
a
huntsman
or
a
stablehand
or
a
smith.
If
the
boy
showed
any
aptitude
for
arms,
some
knight
might
even
take
him
as
a
squire.

Maester
Aemon
was
going
to
a
better
place
as
well.
It
was
pleasant
to
think
of
him
spending
whatever
time
remained
him
bathed
by
the
warm
breezes
of
Oldtown,
conversing
with
his
fellow
maesters
and
sharing
his
wisdom
with
acolytes
and
novices.
He
had
earned
his
rest,
a
hundred
times
over.

Even
Dareon
would
be
happier.
He
had
always
claimed
to
be
innocent
of
the
rape
that
sent
him
to
the
Wall,
insisting
that
he
belonged
at
some
lord’s
court,
singing
for
his
supper.
Now
he
would
have
that
chance.
Jon
had
named
him
a
recruiter,
to
take
the
place
of
a
man
named
Yoren,
who
had
vanished
and
was
presumed
dead.
His
task
would
be
to
travel
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
singing
of
the
valor
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
from
time
to
time
returning
to
the
Wall
with
new
recruits.

The
voyage
would
be
long
and
rough,
no
one
could
deny
that,
but
for
the
others
at
least
there
would
be
a
happy
end.
That
was
Sam’s
solace.
I
am
going
for
them,
he
told
himself,
for
the
Night’s
Watch,
and
for
the
happy
ending.
The
longer
he
looked
at
the
sea,
though,
the
colder
and
deeper
it
appeared.

But
not
looking
at
the
water
was
even
worse,
Sam
realized
in
the
cramped
cabin
beneath
the
sterncastle
that
the
passengers
were
sharing.
He
tried
to
take
his
mind
off
the
roiling
in
his
stomach
by
talking
with
Gilly
as
she
nursed
her
son.
“This
ship
will
take
us
as
far
as
Braavos,”
he
said.
“We’ll
find
another
ship
to
carry
us
to
Oldtown.
I
read
a
book
about
Braavos
when
I
was
small.
The
whole
city
is
built
in
a
lagoon
on
a
hundred
little
islands,
and
they
have
a
titan
there,
a
stone
man
hundreds
of
feet
high.
They
have
boats
instead
of
horses,
and
their
mummers
play
out
written
stories
instead
of
just
making
up
the
usual
stupid
farces.
The
food
is
very
good
too,
especially
the
fish.
They
have
all
kinds
of
clams
and
eels
and
oysters,
fresh
from
their
lagoon.
We
ought
to
have
a
few
days
between
ships.
If
we
do,
we
can
go
and
see
a
mummer
show,
and
have
some
oysters.”

He
thought
that
would
excite
her.
He
could
not
have
been
more
wrong.
Gilly
peered
at
him
with
flat,
dull
eyes,
looking
through
some
strands
of
unwashed
hair.
“If
you
want,
m’lord.”

“What
do
you
want?”
Sam
asked
her.

“Nothing.”
She
turned
away
from
him
and
moved
her
son
from
one
breast
to
the
other.

The
motion
of
the
boat
was
stirring
up
the
eggs
and
bacon
and
fried
bread
that
Sam
had
eaten
before
the
ship
set
out.
All
at
once
he
could
not
stand
the
cabin
one
more
instant.
He
pushed
himself
back
to
his
feet
and
clambered
up
the
ladder
to
give
his
breakfast
to
the
sea.
The
sickness
came
on
Sam
so
strongly
that
he
did
not
stop
to
gauge
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing,
so
he
retched
from
the
wrong
rail
and
ended
up
spattering
himself.
Even
so,
he
felt
much
better
afterward...
though
not
for
long.

The
ship
was
Blackbird,
the
largest
of
the
Watch’s
galleys.
Storm
Crow
and
Talon
were
faster,
Cotter
Pyke
told
Maester
Aemon
back
at
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,
but
they
were
fighting
ships,
lean,
swift
birds
of
prey
where
the
rowers
sat
on
open
decks.
Blackbird
was
a
better
choice
for
the
rough
waters
of
the
narrow
sea
beyond
Skagos.
“There
have
been
storms,”
Pyke
warned
them.
“Winter
storms
are
worse,
but
autumn’s
are
more
frequent.”

The
first
ten
days
were
calm
enough,
as
Blackbird
crept
across
the
Bay
of
Seals,
never
out
of
sight
of
land.
It
was
cold
when
the
wind
was
blowing,
but
there
was
something
bracing
about
the
salt
smell
in
the
air.
Sam
could
hardly
eat,
and
when
he
did
force
something
down
it
did
not
stay
down
for
long,
but
aside
from
that
he
did
not
do
too
badly.
He
tried
to
bolster
Gilly’s
courage
and
give
her
what
cheer
he
could,
but
that
proved
hard.
She
would
not
come
up
on
deck,
no
matter
what
he
said,
and
seemed
to
prefer
to
huddle
in
the
dark
with
her
son.
The
babe
liked
the
ship
no
more
than
his
mother
did,
it
seemed.
When
he
was
not
squalling,
he
was
retching
up
his
mother’s
milk.
His
bowels
were
loose
and
always
moving,
staining
the
furs
that
Gilly
wrapped
him
in
to
keep
him
warm
and
filling
the
air
with
a
brown
stench.
No
matter
how
many
tallow
candles
Sam
lit,
the
smell
of
shit
persisted.

It
was
more
pleasant
out
in
the
open
air,
especially
when
Dareon
was
singing.
The
singer
was
known
to
Blackbird’s
oarsmen,
and
would
play
for
them
as
they
rowed.
He
knew
all
their
favorite
songs:
sad
ones
like
“The
Day
They
Hanged
Black
Robin,”
“The
Mermaid’s
Lament,”
and
“Autumn
of
My
Day,”
rousing
ones
like
“Iron
Lances”
and
“Seven
Swords
for
Seven
Sons,”
bawdy
ones
like
“Milady’s
Supper,”
“Her
Little
Flower,”
and
“Meggett
Was
a
Merry
Maid,
a
Merry
Maid
Was
She.”
When
he
sang
“The
Bear
and
the
Maiden
Fair,”
all
the
oarsmen
joined
in,
and
Blackbird
seemed
to
fly
across
the
water.
Dareon
had
not
been
much
of
a
swordsman,
Sam
knew
from
their
days
training
under
Alliser
Thorne,
but
he
had
a
beautiful
voice.
“Honey
poured
over
thunder,”
Maester
Aemon
had
once
called
it.
He
played
woodharp
and
fiddle
too,
and
even
wrote
his
own
songs...
though
Sam
did
not
think
them
very
good.
Still,
it
was
good
to
sit
and
listen,
though
the
chest
was
so
hard
and
splintery
that
Sam
was
almost
grateful
for
his
fleshy
buttocks.
Fat
men
take
a
cushion
with
them
wherever
they
go,
he
thought.

Maester
Aemon
preferred
to
spend
his
days
on
deck
as
well,
huddled
beneath
a
pile
of
furs
and
gazing
out
across
the
water.
“What
is
he
looking
at?”
Dareon
wondered
one
day.
“For
him
it’s
as
dark
up
here
as
it
is
down
in
the
cabin.”

The
old
man
heard
him.
Though
Aemon’s
eyes
had
dimmed
and
gone
dark,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
ears.
“I
was
not
born
blind,”
he
reminded
them.
“When
last
I
passed
this
way,
I
saw
every
rock
and
tree
and
whitecap,
and
watched
the
grey
gulls
flying
in
our
wake.
I
was
five-and-thirty
and
had
been
a
maester
of
the
chain
for
sixteen
years.
Egg
wanted
me
to
help
him
rule,
but
I
knew
my
place
was
here.
He
sent
me
north
aboard
the
Golden
Dragon,
and
insisted
that
his
friend
Ser
Duncan
see
me
safe
to
Eastwatch.
No
recruit
had
arrived
at
the
Wall
with
so
much
pomp
since
Nymeria
sent
the
Watch
six
kings
in
golden
fetters.
Egg
emptied
out
the
dungeons
too,
so
I
would
not
need
to
say
my
vows
alone.
My
honor
guard,
he
called
them.
One
was
no
less
a
man
than
Brynden
Rivers.
Later
he
was
chosen
lord
commander.”

“Bloodraven?”
said
Dareon.
“I
know
a
song
about
him.
‘A
Thousand
Eyes,
and
One,’
it’s
called.
But
I
thought
he
lived
a
hundred
years
ago.”

“We
all
did.
Once
I
was
as
young
as
you.”
That
seemed
to
make
him
sad.
He
coughed,
and
closed
his
eyes,
and
went
to
sleep,
swaying
in
his
furs
whenever
some
wave
rocked
the
ship.

Beneath
grey
skies
they
sailed,
east
and
south
and
east
again,
as
the
Bay
of
Seals
widened
about
them.
The
captain,
a
grizzled
brother
with
a
belly
like
a
keg
of
ale,
wore
blacks
so
stained
and
faded
that
the
crew
called
him
Old
Tattersalt.
He
seldom
said
a
word.
His
mate
made
up
for
him,
blistering
the
salt
air
with
curses
whenever
the
wind
died
or
the
oarsmen
seemed
to
flag.
They
ate
oaten
porridge
in
the
mornings,
pease
porridge
in
the
afternoons,
and
salt
beef,
salt
cod,
and
salt
mutton
at
night,
and
washed
it
down
with
ale.
Dareon
sang,
Sam
retched,
Gilly
cried
and
nursed
her
babe,
Maester
Aemon
slept
and
shivered,
and
the
winds
grew
colder
and
more
blustery
with
every
passing
day.

Even
so,
it
was
a
better
voyage
than
the
last
one
Sam
had
taken.
He
had
been
no
more
than
ten
when
he
set
sail
on
Lord
Redwyne’s
galleas,
the
Arbor
Queen.
Five
times
as
large
as
Blackbird
and
magnificent
to
behold,
she
had
three
great
burgundy
sails
and
banks
of
oars
that
flashed
gold
and
white
in
the
sunlight.
The
way
they
rose
and
fell
as
the
ship
departed
Oldtown
had
made
Sam
hold
his
breath...
but
that
was
the
last
good
memory
he
had
of
the
Redwyne
Straits.
Then
as
now
the
sea
had
made
him
sick,
to
his
lord
father’s
disgust.

And
when
they
reached
the
Arbor,
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse.
Lord
Redwyne’s
twin
sons
had
despised
Sam
on
first
sight.
Every
morn
they
found
some
fresh
way
to
shame
him
in
the
practice
yard.
On
the
third
day
Horas
Redwyne
made
him
squeal
like
a
pig
when
he
begged
for
quarter.
On
the
fifth
his
brother
Hobber
clad
a
kitchen
girl
in
his
own
armor
and
let
her
beat
Sam
with
a
wooden
sword
until
he
began
to
cry.
When
she
revealed
herself,
all
the
squires
and
pages
and
stableboys
howled
with
laughter.

“The
boy
needs
a
bit
of
seasoning,
that’s
all,”
his
father
had
told
Lord
Redwyne
that
night,
but
Redwyne’s
fool
rattled
his
rattle
and
replied,
“Aye,
a
pinch
of
pepper,
a
few
nice
cloves,
and
an
apple
in
his
mouth.”
Thereafter,
Lord
Randyll
forbade
Sam
to
eat
apples
so
long
as
they
remained
beneath
Paxter
Redwyne’s
roof.
He
had
been
seasick
on
their
voyage
home
as
well,
but
so
relieved
to
be
going
that
he
almost
welcomed
the
taste
of
vomit
at
the
back
of
his
throat.
It
was
not
until
they
were
back
at
Horn
Hill
that
his
mother
told
Sam
that
his
father
had
never
meant
for
him
to
return.
“Horas
was
to
come
with
us
in
your
place,
whilst
you
remained
on
the
Arbor
as
Lord
Paxter’s
page
and
cupbearer.
If
you
had
pleased
him,
you
would
have
been
betrothed
to
his
daughter.”
Sam
could
still
recall
the
soft
touch
of
his
mother’s
hand
as
she
washed
the
tears
off
his
face
with
a
bit
of
lace,
dampened
with
her
spit.
“My
poor
Sam,”
she
murmured.
“My
poor
poor
Sam.”

It
will
be
good
to
see
her
again,
he
thought,
as
he
clung
to
Blackbird’s
rail
and
watched
waves
breaking
on
the
stony
shore.
If
she
saw
me
in
my
blacks,
it
might
even
make
her
proud.
“I
am
a
man
now,
Mother,”
I
could
tell
her,
“a
steward,
and
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
My
brothers
call
me
Sam
the
Slayer
sometimes.”
He
would
see
his
brother
Dickon
too,
and
his
sisters.
“See,”
I
could
tell
them,
“see,
I
was
good
for
something
after
all.”

If
he
went
to
Horn
Hill,
though,
his
father
might
be
there.

The
thought
made
his
belly
heave
again.
Sam
bent
over
the
gunwale
and
retched,
but
not
into
the
wind.
He
had
gone
to
the
right
rail
this
time.
He
was
getting
good
at
retching.

Or
so
he
thought,
until
Blackbird
left
the
land
behind
and
struck
east
across
the
bay
for
the
shores
of
Skagos.

The
island
sat
at
the
mouth
of
the
Bay
of
Seals,
massive
and
mountainous,
a
stark
and
forbidding
land
peopled
by
savages.
They
lived
in
caves
and
grim
mountain
fastnesses,
Sam
had
read,
and
rode
great
shaggy
unicorns
to
war.
Skagos
meant
“stone”
in
the
Old
Tongue.
The
Skagosi
named
themselves
the
stoneborn,
but
their
fellow
northmen
called
them
Skaggs
and
liked
them
little.
Only
a
hundred
years
ago
Skagos
had
risen
in
rebellion.
Their
revolt
had
taken
years
to
quell
and
claimed
the
life
of
the
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
hundreds
of
his
sworn
swords.
Some
songs
said
the
Skaggs
were
cannibals;
supposedly
their
warriors
ate
the
hearts
and
livers
of
the
men
they
slew.
In
ancient
days,
the
Skagosi
had
sailed
to
the
nearby
isle
of
Skane,
seized
its
women,
slaughtered
its
men,
and
ate
them
on
a
pebbled
beach
in
a
feast
that
lasted
for
a
fortnight.
Skane
remained
unpeopled
to
this
day.

Dareon
knew
the
songs
as
well.
When
the
bleak
grey
peaks
of
Skagos
rose
up
from
the
sea,
he
joined
Sam
at
Blackbird’s
prow,
and
said,
“If
the
gods
are
good,
we
may
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
unicorn.”

“If
the
captain
is
good,
we
won’t
come
that
close.
The
currents
are
treacherous
around
Skagos,
and
there
are
rocks
that
can
crack
a
ship’s
hull
like
an
egg.
But
don’t
you
mention
that
to
Gilly.
She’s
scared
enough.”

“Her
and
that
squalling
whelp
of
hers.
I
don’t
know
which
of
them
is
noisier.
The
only
time
he
ever
stops
crying
is
when
she
shoves
a
nipple
in
his
mouth,
and
then
she
starts
to
sob.”

Sam
had
noticed
that
as
well.
“Maybe
the
babe
is
hurting
her,”
he
said,
feebly.
“If
his
teeth
are
coming
in...”

Dareon
plucked
at
his
lute
with
one
finger,
sending
up
a
derisive
note.
“I’d
heard
that
wildlings
were
braver
than
that.”

“She
is
brave,”
Sam
insisted,
though
even
he
had
to
admit
that
he
had
never
seen
Gilly
in
such
a
wretched
state.
Though
she
hid
her
face
more
oft
than
not
and
kept
the
cabin
dark,
he
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
always
red,
her
cheeks
wet
with
tears.
When
he
asked
her
what
was
wrong,
though,
she
only
shook
her
head,
leaving
him
to
find
answers
of
his
own.
“The
sea
scares
her,
that’s
all,”
he
told
Dareon.
“Before
she
came
to
the
Wall,
all
she
knew
was
Craster’s
Keep
and
the
woods
around
it.
I
don’t
know
that
she
went
more
than
half
a
league
from
the
place
that
she
was
born.
She
knows
streams
and
rivers,
but
she
had
never
seen
a
lake
until
we
came
on
one,
and
the
sea...
the
sea
is
a
scary
thing.”

“We’ve
never
been
out
of
sight
of
land.”

“We
will
be.”
Sam
did
not
relish
that
part
himself.

“Surely
a
little
water
does
not
frighten
the
Slayer.”

“No,”
Sam
lied,
“not
me.
But
Gilly...
maybe
if
you
played
some
lullabies
for
them,
it
would
help
the
babe
to
sleep.”

Dareon’s
mouth
twisted
in
disgust.
“Only
if
she
shoves
a
plug
up
his
arse.
I
cannot
abide
the
smell.”

The
next
day
the
rains
began,
and
the
seas
grew
rougher.
“We
had
best
go
below,
where
it’s
dry,”
Sam
said
to
Aemon,
but
the
old
maester
only
smiled,
and
said,
“The
rain
feels
good
against
my
face,
Sam.
It
feels
like
tears.
Let
me
stay
a
while
longer,
I
pray
you.
It
has
been
a
long
time
since
last
I
wept.”

If
Maester
Aemon
meant
to
stay
on
deck,
old
and
frail
as
he
was,
Sam
had
no
choice
but
to
do
the
same.
He
stayed
beside
the
old
man
for
nigh
unto
an
hour,
huddled
in
his
cloak
as
a
soft,
steady
rain
soaked
him
to
his
skin.
Aemon
hardly
seemed
to
feel
it.
He
sighed
and
closed
his
eyes,
and
Sam
moved
closer
to
him,
to
shield
him
from
the
worst
of
the
wind.
He
will
ask
me
to
help
him
to
the
cabin
soon,
he
told
himself.
He
must.
But
he
never
did,
and
finally
thunder
began
to
rumble
in
the
distance,
off
to
the
east.
“We
have
to
get
below,”
Sam
said,
shivering.
Maester
Aemon
did
not
reply.
It
was
only
then
that
Sam
realized
the
old
man
had
gone
to
sleep.
“Maester,”
he
said,
shaking
him
gently
by
one
shoulder.
“Maester
Aemon,
wake
up.”

Aemon’s
blind
white
eyes
came
open.
“Egg?”
he
said,
as
the
rain
streamed
down
his
cheeks.
“Egg,
I
dreamed
that
I
was
old.”

DAENERYS

“The
Dothraki
sea,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said
as
he
reined
to
a
halt
beside
her
on
the
top
of
the
ridge.
beneath
them,
the
plain
stretched
out
immense
and
empty,
a
vast
flat
expanse
that
reached
to
the
distant
horizon
and
beyond.
It
was
a
sea,
Dany
thought.
Past
here,
there
were
no
hills,
no
mountains,
no
trees
nor
cities
nor
roads,
only
the
endless
grasses,
the
tall
blades
rippling
like
waves
when
the
winds
blew.
“It’s
so
green,”
she
said.

“Here
and
now,”
Ser
Jorah
agreed.
“You
ought
to
see
it
when
it
blooms,
all
dark
red
flowers
from
horizon
to
horizon,
like
a
sea
of
blood.
Come
the
dry
season,
and
the
world
turns
the
color
of
old
bronze.
And
this
is
only
hranna,
child.
There
are
a
hundred
kinds
of
grass
out
there,
grasses
as
yellow
as
lemon
and
as
dark
as
indigo,
blue
grasses
and
orange
grasses
and
grasses
like
rainbows.
Down
in
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai,
they
say
there
are
oceans
of
ghost
grass,
taller
than
a
man
on
horseback
with
stalks
as
pale
as
milkglass.
It
murders
all
other
grass
and
glows
in
the
dark
with
the
spirits
of
the
damned.
The
Dothraki
claim
that
someday
ghost
grass
will
cover
the
entire
world,
and
then
all
life
will
end.”

That
thought
gave
Dany
the
shivers.
“I
don’t
want
to
talk
about
that
now,”
she
said.
“It’s
so
beautiful
here,
I
don’t
want
to
think
about
everything
dying.”

“As
you
will,
Khaleesi,”
Ser
Jorah
said
respectfully.

She
heard
the
sound
of
voices
and
turned
to
look
behind
her.
She
and
Mormont
had
outdistanced
the
rest
of
their
party,
and
now
the
others
were
climbing
the
ridge
below
them.
Her
handmaid
Irri
and
the
young
archers
of
her
khas
were
fluid
as
centaurs,
but
Viserys
still
struggled
with
the
short
stirrups
and
the
flat
saddle.
Her
brother
was
miserable
out
here.
He
ought
never
have
come.
Magister
Illyrio
had
urged
him
to
wait
in
Pentos,
had
offered
him
the
hospitality
of
his
manse,
but
Viserys
would
have
none
of
it.
He
would
stay
with
Drogo
until
the
debt
had
been
paid,
until
he
had
the
crown
he
had
been
promised.
“And
if
he
tries
to
cheat
me,
he
will
learn
to
his
sorrow
what
it
means
to
wake
the
dragon,”
Viserys
had
vowed,
laying
a
hand
on
his
borrowed
sword.
Illyrio
had
blinked
at
that
and
wished
him
good
fortune.

Dany
realized
that
she
did
not
want
to
listen
to
any
of
her
brother’s
complaints
right
now.
The
day
was
too
perfect.
The
sky
was
a
deep
blue,
and
high
above
them
a
hunting
hawk
circled.
The
grass
sea
swayed
and
sighed
with
each
breath
of
wind,
the
air
was
warm
on
her
face,
and
Dany
felt
at
peace.
She
would
not
let
Viserys
spoil
it.

“Wait
here,”
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah.
“Tell
them
all
to
stay.
Tell
them
I
command
it.”

The
knight
smiled.
Ser
Jorah
was
not
a
handsome
man.
He
had
a
neck
and
shoulders
like
a
bull,
and
coarse
black
hair
covered
his
arms
and
chest
so
thickly
that
there
was
none
left
for
his
head.
Yet
his
smiles
gave
Dany
comfort.
“You
are
learning
to
talk
like
a
queen,
Daenerys.”

“Not
a
queen,”
said
Dany.
“A
khaleesi.”
She
wheeled
her
horse
about
and
galloped
down
the
ridge
alone.

The
descent
was
steep
and
rocky,
but
Dany
rode
fearlessly,
and
the
joy
and
the
danger
of
it
were
a
song
in
her
heart.
All
her
life
Viserys
had
told
her
she
was
a
princess,
but
not
until
she
rode
her
silver
had
Daenerys
Targaryen
ever
felt
like
one.

At
first
it
had
not
come
easy.
The
khalasar
had
broken
camp
the
morning
after
her
wedding,
moving
east
toward
Vaes
Dothrak,
and
by
the
third
day
Dany
thought
she
was
going
to
die.
Saddle
sores
opened
on
her
bottom,
hideous
and
bloody.
Her
thighs
were
chafed
raw,
her
hands
blistered
from
the
reins,
the
muscles
of
her
legs
and
back
so
wracked
with
pain
that
she
could
scarcely
sit.
By
the
time
dusk
fell,
her
handmaids
would
need
to
help
her
down
from
her
mount.

Even
the
nights
brought
no
relief.
Khal
Drogo
ignored
her
when
they
rode,
even
as
he
had
ignored
her
during
their
wedding,
and
spent
his
evenings
drinking
with
his
warriors
and
bloodriders,
racing
his
prize
horses,
watching
women
dance
and
men
die.
Dany
had
no
place
in
these
parts
of
his
life.
She
was
left
to
sup
alone,
or
with
Ser
Jorah
and
her
brother,
and
afterward
to
cry
herself
to
sleep.
Yet
every
night,
some
time
before
the
dawn,
Drogo
would
come
to
her
tent
and
wake
her
in
the
dark,
to
ride
her
as
relentlessly
as
he
rode
his
stallion.
He
always
took
her
from
behind,
Dothraki
fashion,
for
which
Dany
was
grateful;
that
way
her
lord
husband
could
not
see
the
tears
that
wet
her
face,
and
she
could
use
her
pillow
to
muffle
her
cries
of
pain.
When
he
was
done,
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
begin
to
snore
softly
and
Dany
would
lie
beside
him,
her
body
bruised
and
sore,
hurting
too
much
for
sleep.

Day
followed
day,
and
night
followed
night,
until
Dany
knew
she
could
not
endure
a
moment
longer.
She
would
kill
herself
rather
than
go
on,
she
decided
one
night…

Yet
when
she
slept
that
night,
she
dreamt
the
dragon
dream
again.
Viserys
was
not
in
it
this
time.
There
was
only
her
and
the
dragon.
Its
scales
were
black
as
night,
wet
and
slick
with
blood.
Her
blood,
Dany
sensed.
Its
eyes
were
pools
of
molten
magma,
and
when
it
opened
its
mouth,
the
flame
came
roaring
out
in
a
hot
jet.
She
could
hear
it
singing
to
her,
She
opened
her
arms
to
the
fire,
embraced
it,
let
it
swallow
her
whole,
let
it
cleanse
her
and
temper
her
and
scour
her
clean.
She
could
feel
her
flesh
sear
and
blacken
and
slough
away,
could
feel
her
blood
boil
and
turn
to
steam,
and
yet
there
was
no
pain.
She
felt
strong
and
new
and
fierce.

And
the
next
day,
strangely,
she
did
not
seem
to
hurt
quite
so
much.
It
was
as
if
the
gods
had
heard
her
and
taken
pity.
Even
her
handmaids
noticed
the
change.
“Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
said,
“what
is
wrong?
Are
you
sick?”

“I
was,”
she
answered,
standing
over
the
dragon’s
eggs
that
Illyrio
had
given
her
when
she
wed.
She
touched
one,
the
largest
of
the
three,
running
her
hand
lightly
over
the
shelf.
Black-and-scarlet,
she
thought,
like
the
dragon
in
my
dream.
The
stone
felt
strangely
warm
beneath
her
fingers…
or
was
she
still
dreaming?
She
pulled
her
hand
back
nervously.

From
that
hour
onward,
each
day
was
easier
than
the
one
before
it.
Her
legs
grew
stronger;
her
blisters
burst
and
her
hands
grew
callused;
her
soft
thighs
toughened,
supple
as
leather.

The
khal
had
commanded
the
handmaid
Irri
to
teach
Dany
to
ride
in
the
Dothraki
fashion,
but
it
was
the
filly
who
was
her
real
teacher.
The
horse
seemed
to
know
her
moods,
as
if
they
shared
a
single
mind.
With
every
passing
day,
Dany
felt
surer
in
her
seat.
The
Dothraki
were
a
hard
and
unsentimental
people,
and
it
was
not
their
custom
to
name
their
animals,
so
Dany
thought
of
her
only
as
the
silver.
She
had
never
loved
anything
so
much.

As
the
riding
became
less
an
ordeal,
Dany
began
to
notice
the
beauties
of
the
land
around
her.
She
rode
at
the
head
of
the
khalasar
with
Drogo
and
his
bloodriders,
so
she
came
to
each
country
fresh
and
unspoiled.
Behind
them
the
great
horde
might
tear
the
earth
and
muddy
the
rivers
and
send
up
clouds
of
choking
dust,
but
the
fields
ahead
of
them
were
always
green
and
verdant.

They
crossed
the
rolling
hills
of
Norvos,
past
terraced
farms
and
small
villages
where
the
townsfolk
watched
anxiously
from
atop
white
stucco
walls.
They
forded
three
wide
placid
rivers
and
a
fourth
that
was
swift
and
narrow
and
treacherous,
camped
beside
a
high
blue
waterfall,
skirted
the
tumbled
ruins
of
a
vast
dead
city
where
ghosts
were
said
to
moan
among
blackened
marble
columns.
They
raced
down
Valyrian
roads
a
thousand
years
old
and
straight
as
a
Dothraki
arrow.
For
half
a
moon,
they
rode
through
the
Forest
of
Qohor,
where
the
leaves
made
a
golden
canopy
high
above
them,
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
were
as
wide
as
city
gates.
There
were
great
elk
in
that
wood,
and
spotted
tigers,
and
lemurs
with
silver
fur
and
huge
purple
eyes,
but
all
fled
before
the
approach
of
the
khalasar
and
Dany
got
no
glimpse
of
them.

By
then
her
agony
was
a
fading
memory.
She
still
ached
after
a
long
day’s
riding,
yet
somehow
the
pain
had
a
sweetness
to
it
now,
and
each
morning
she
came
willingly
to
her
saddle,
eager
to
know
what
wonders
waited
for
her
in
the
lands
ahead.
She
began
to
find
pleasure
even
in
her
nights,
and
if
she
still
cried
out
when
Drogo
took
her,
it
was
not
always
in
pain.

At
the
bottom
of
the
ridge,
the
grasses
rose
around
her,
tall
and
supple.
Dany
slowed
to
a
trot
and
rode
out
onto
the
plain,
losing
herself
in
the
green,
blessedly
alone.
In
the
khalasar
she
was
never
alone.
Khal
Drogo
came
to
her
only
after
the
sun
went
down,
but
her
handmaids
fed
her
and
bathed
her
and
slept
by
the
door
of
her
tent,
Drogo’s
bloodriders
and
the
men
of
her
khas
were
never
far,
and
her
brother
was
an
unwelcome
shadow,
day
and
night.
Dany
could
hear
him
on
the
top
of
the
ridge,
his
voice
shrill
with
anger
as
he
shouted
at
Ser
Jorah.
She
rode
on,
submerging
herself
deeper
in
the
Dothraki
sea.

The
green
swallowed
her
up.
The
air
was
rich
with
the
scents
of
earth
and
grass,
mixed
with
the
smell
of
horseflesh
and
Dany’s
sweat
and
the
oil
in
her
hair.
Dothraki
smells.
They
seemed
to
belong
here.
Dany
breathed
it
all
in,
laughing.
She
had
a
sudden
urge
to
feel
the
ground
beneath
her,
to
curl
her
toes
in
that
thick
black
soil.
Swinging
down
from
her
saddle,
she
let
the
silver
graze
while
she
pulled
off
her
high
boots.

Viserys
came
upon
her
as
sudden
as
a
summer
storm,
his
horse
rearing
beneath
him
as
he
reined
up
too
hard.
“You
dare!”
he
screamed
at
her.
“You
give
commands
to
me?
To
me?”
He
vaulted
off
the
horse,
stumbling
as
he
landed.
His
face
was
flushed
as
he
struggled
back
to
his
feet.
He
grabbed
her,
shook
her.
“Have
you
forgotten
who
you
are?
Look
at
you.
Look
at
you!”

Dany
did
not
need
to
look.
She
was
barefoot,
with
oiled
hair,
wearing
Dothraki
riding
leathers
and
a
painted
vest
given
her
as
a
bride
gift.
She
looked
as
though
she
belonged
here.
Viserys
was
soiled
and
stained
in
city
silks
and
ringmail.

He
was
still
screaming.
“You
do
not
command
the
dragon.
Do
you
understand?
I
am
the
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
I
will
not
hear
orders
from
some
horselord’s
slut,
do
you
hear
me?”
His
hand
went
under
her
vest,
his
fingers
digging
painfully
into
her
breast.
“Do
you
hear
me?”

Dany
shoved
him
away,
hard.

Viserys
stared
at
her,
his
lilac
eyes
incredulous.
She
had
never
defied
him.
Never
fought
back.
Rage
twisted
his
features.
He
would
hurt
her
now,
and
badly,
she
knew
that.

Crack.

The
whip
made
a
sound
like
thunder.
The
coil
took
Viserys
around
the
throat
and
yanked
him
backward.
He
went
sprawling
in
the
grass,
stunned
and
choking.
The
Dothraki
riders
hooted
at
him
as
he
struggled
to
free
himself.
The
one
with
the
whip,
young
Jhogo,
rasped
a
question.
Dany
did
not
understand
his
words,
but
by
then
Irri
was
there,
and
Ser
Jorah,
and
the
rest
of
her
khas.
“Jhogo
asks
if
you
would
have
him
dead,
Khaleesi,”
Irri
said.

“No,”
Dany
replied.
“No.”

Jhogo
understood
that.
One
of
the
others
barked
out
a
comment,
and
the
Dothraki
laughed.
Irri
told
her,
“Quaro
thinks
you
should
take
an
ear
to
teach
him
respect.”

Her
brother
was
on
his
knees,
his
fingers
digging
under
the
leather
coils,
crying
incoherently,
struggling
for
breath.
The
whip
was
tight
around
his
windpipe.

“Tell
them
I
do
not
wish
him
harmed,”
Dany
said.

Irri
repeated
her
words
in
Dothraki.
Jhogo
gave
a
pull
on
the
whip,
yanking
Viserys
around
like
a
puppet
on
a
string.
He
went
sprawling
again,
freed
from
the
leather
embrace,
a
thin
line
of
blood
under
his
chin
where
the
whip
had
cut
deep.

“I
warned
him
what
would
happen,
my
lady,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said.
“I
told
him
to
stay
on
the
ridge,
as
you
commanded.”

“I
know
you
did,”
Dany
replied,
watching
Viserys.
He
lay
on
the
ground,
sucking
in
air
noisily,
red-faced
and
sobbing.
He
was
a
pitiful
thing.
He
had
always
been
a
pitiful
thing.
Why
had
she
never
seen
that
before?
There
was
a
hollow
place
inside
her
where
her
fear
had
been.

“Take
his
horse,”
Dany
commanded
Ser
Jorah.
Viserys
gaped
at
her.
He
could
not
believe
what
he
was
hearing;
nor
could
Dany
quite
believe
what
she
was
saying.
Yet
the
words
came.
“Let
my
brother
walk
behind
us
back
to
the
khalasar.”
Among
the
Dothraki,
the
man
who
does
not
ride
was
no
man
at
all,
the
lowest
of
the
low,
without
honor
or
pride.
“Let
everyone
see
him
as
he
is.”

“No!”
Viserys
screamed.
He
turned
to
Ser
Jorah,
pleading
in
the
Common
Tongue
with
words
the
horsemen
would
not
understand.
“Hit
her,
Mormont.
Hurt
her.
Your
king
commands
it.
Kill
these
Dothraki
dogs
and
teach
her.”

The
exile
knight
looked
from
Dany
to
her
brother;
she
barefoot,
with
dirt
between
her
toes
and
oil
in
her
hair,
he
with
his
silks
and
steel.
Dany
could
see
the
decision
on
his
face.
“He
shall
walk,
Khaleesi,”
he
said.
He
took
her
brother’s
horse
in
hand
while
Dany
remounted
her
silver.

Viserys
gaped
at
him,
and
sat
down
in
the
dirt.
He
kept
his
silence,
but
he
would
not
move,
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
poison
as
they
rode
away.
Soon
he
was
lost
in
the
tall
grass.
When
they
could
not
see
him
anymore,
Dany
grew
afraid.
“Will
he
find
his
way
back?”
she
asked
Ser
Jorah
as
they
rode.

“Even
a
man
as
blind
as
your
brother
should
be
able
to
follow
our
trail,”
he
replied.

“He
is
proud.
He
may
be
too
shamed
to
come
back.”

Jorah
laughed.
“Where
else
should
he
go?
If
he
cannot
find
the
khalasar,
the
khalasar
will
most
surely
find
him.
It
is
hard
to
drown
in
the
Dothraki
sea,
child.”

Dany
saw
the
truth
of
that.
The
khalasar
was
like
a
city
on
the
march,
but
it
did
not
march
blindly.
Always
scouts
ranged
far
ahead
of
the
main
column,
alert
for
any
sign
of
game
or
prey
or
enemies,
while
outriders
guarded
their
flanks.
They
missed
nothing,
not
here,
in
this
land,
the
place
where
they
had
come
from.
These
plains
were
a
part
of
them…
and
of
her,
now.

“I
hit
him,”
she
said,
wonder
in
her
voice.
Now
that
it
was
over,
it
seemed
like
some
strange
dream
that
she
had
dreamed.
“Ser
Jorah,
do
you
think…
he’ll
be
so
angry
when
he
gets
back…
She
shivered.
“I
woke
the
dragon,
didn’t
I?”

Ser
Jorah
snorted.
“Can
you
wake
the
dead,
girl?
Your
brother
Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,
and
he
died
on
the
Trident.
Viserys
is
less
than
the
shadow
of
a
snake.”

His
blunt
words
startled
her.
It
seemed
as
though
all
the
things
she
had
always
believed
were
suddenly
called
into
question.
“You…
you
swore
him
your
sword…”

“That
I
did,
girl,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“And
if
your
brother
is
the
shadow
of
a
snake,
what
does
that
make
his
servants?”
His
voice
was
bitter.

“He
is
still
the
true
king.
He
is…”

Jorah
pulled
up
his
horse
and
looked
at
her.
“Truth
now.
Would
you
want
to
see
Viserys
sit
a
throne?”

Dany
thought
about
that.
“He
would
not
be
a
very
good
king,
would
he?”

“There
have
been
worse…
but
not
many.”
The
knight
gave
his
heels
to
his
mount
and
started
off
again.

Dany
rode
close
beside
him.
“Still,”
she
said,
“the
common
people
are
waiting
for
him.
Magister
Illyrio
says
they
are
sewing
dragon
banners
and
praying
for
Viserys
to
return
from
across
the
narrow
sea
to
free
them.”

“The
common
people
pray
for
rain,
healthy
children,
and
a
summer
that
never
ends,”
Ser
Jorah
told
her.
“It
is
no
matter
to
them
if
the
high
lords
play
their
game
of
thrones,
so
long
as
they
are
left
in
peace.”
He
gave
a
shrug.
“They
never
are.”

Dany
rode
along
quietly
for
a
time,
working
his
words
like
a
puzzle
box.
It
went
against
everything
that
Viserys
had
ever
told
her
to
think
that
the
people
could
care
so
little
whether
a
true
king
or
a
usurper
reigned
over
them.
Yet
the
more
she
thought
on
Jorah’s
words,
the
more
they
rang
of
truth.

“What
do
you
pray
for,
Ser
Jorah?”
she
asked
him.

“Home,”
he
said.
His
voice
was
thick
with
longing.

“I
pray
for
home
too,”
she
told
him,
believing
it.

Ser
Jorah
laughed.
“Look
around
you
then,
Khaleesi.”

But
it
was
not
the
plains
Dany
saw
then.
It
was
King’s
Landing
and
the
great
Red
Keep
that
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
built.
It
was
Dragonstone
where
she
had
been
born.
In
her
mind’s
eye
they
burned
with
a
thousand
lights,
a
fire
blazing
in
every
window.
In
her
mind’s
eye,
all
the
doors
were
red.

“My
brother
will
never
take
back
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Dany
said.
She
had
known
that
for
a
long
time,
she
realized.
She
had
known
it
all
her
life.
Only
she
had
never
let
herself
say
the
words,
even
in
a
whisper,
but
now
she
said
them
for
Jorah
Mormont
and
all
the
world
to
hear.

Ser
Jorah
gave
her
a
measuring
look.
“You
think
not.”

“He
could
not
lead
an
army
even
if
my
lord
husband
gave
him
one,”
Dany
said.
“He
has
no
coin
and
the
only
knight
who
follows
him
reviles
him
as
less
than
a
snake.
The
Dothraki
make
mock
of
his
weakness.
He
will
never
take
us
home.”

“Wise
child.”
The
knight
smiled.

“I
am
no
child,”
she
told
him
fiercely.
Her
heels
pressed
into
the
sides
of
her
mount,
rousing
the
silver
to
a
gallop.
Faster
and
faster
she
raced,
leaving
Jorah
and
Irri
and
the
others
far
behind,
the
warm
wind
in
her
hair
and
the
setting
sun
red
on
her
face.
By
the
time
she
reached
the
khalasar,
it
was
dusk.

The
slaves
had
erected
her
tent
by
the
shore
of
a
spring-fed
pool.
She
could
hear
rough
voices
from
the
woven
grass
palace
on
the
hill.
Soon
there
would
be
laughter,
when
the
men
of
her
khas
told
the
story
of
what
had
happened
in
the
grasses
today.
By
the
time
Viserys
came
limping
back
among
them,
every
man,
woman,
and
child
in
the
camp
would
know
him
for
a
walker.
There
were
no
secrets
in
the
khalasar.

Dany
gave
the
silver
over
to
the
slaves
for
grooming
and
entered
her
tent.
It
was
cool
and
dim
beneath
the
silk.
As
she
let
the
door
flap
close
behind
her,
Dany
saw
a
finger
of
dusty
red
light
reach
out
to
touch
her
dragon’s
eggs
across
the
tent.
For
an
instant
a
thousand
droplets
of
scarlet
flame
swam
before
her
eyes.
She
blinked,
and
they
were
gone.

Stone,
she
told
herself.
They
are
only
stone,
even
Illyrio
said
so,
the
dragons
are
all
dead.
She
put
her
palm
against
the
black
egg,
fingers
spread
gently
across
the
curve
of
the
shell.
The
stone
was
warm.
Almost
hot.
“The
sun,”
Dany
whispered.
“The
sun
warmed
them
as
they
rode.”

She
commanded
her
handmaids
to
prepare
her
a
bath.
Doreah
built
a
fire
outside
the
tent,
while
Irri
and
Jhiqui
fetched
the
big
copper
tub—another
bride
gift—from
the
packhorses
and
carried
water
from
the
pool.
When
the
bath
was
steaming,
Irri
helped
her
into
it
and
climbed
in
after
her.

“Have
you
ever
seen
a
dragon?”
she
asked
as
Irri
scrubbed
her
back
and
Jhiqui
sluiced
sand
from
her
hair.
She
had
heard
that
the
first
dragons
had
come
from
the
east,
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai
and
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea.
Perhaps
some
were
still
living
there,
in
realms
strange
and
wild.

“Dragons
are
gone,
Khaleesi,”
Irri
said.

“Dead,”
agreed
Jhiqui.
“Long
and
long
ago.”

Viserys
had
told
her
that
the
last
Targaryen
dragons
had
died
no
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
ago,
during
the
reign
of
Aegon
III,
who
was
called
the
Dragonbane.
That
did
not
seem
so
long
ago
to
Dany.
“Everywhere?”
she
said,
disappointed.
“Even
in
the
east?”
Magic
had
died
in
the
west
when
the
Doom
fell
on
Valyria
and
the
Lands
of
the
Long
Summer,
and
neither
spell-forged
steel
nor
stormsingers
nor
dragons
could
hold
it
back,
but
Dany
had
always
heard
that
the
east
was
different.
It
was
said
that
manticores
prowled
the
islands
of
the
Jade
Sea,
that
basilisks
infested
the
jungles
of
Yi
Ti,
that
spellsingers,
warlocks,
and
aeromancers
practiced
their
arts
openly
in
Asshai,
while
shadowbinders
and
bloodmages
worked
terrible
sorceries
in
the
black
of
night.
Why
shouldn’t
there
be
dragons
too?

“No
dragon,”
Irri
said.
“Brave
men
kill
them,
for
dragon
terrible
evil
beasts.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
agreed
Jhiqui.

“A
trader
from
Qarth
once
told
me
that
dragons
came
from
the
moon,”
blond
Doreah
said
as
she
warmed
a
towel
over
the
fire.
Jhiqui
and
Irri
were
of
an
age
with
Dany,
Dothraki
girls
taken
as
slaves
when
Drogo
destroyed
their
father’s
khalasar.
Doreah
was
older,
almost
twenty.
Magister
Illyrio
had
found
her
in
a
pleasure
house
in
Lys.

Silvery-wet
hair
tumbled
across
her
eyes
as
Dany
turned
her
head,
curious.
“The
moon?”

“He
told
me
the
moon
was
an
egg,
Khaleesi,”
the
Lysene
girl
said.
“Once
there
were
two
moons
in
the
sky,
but
one
wandered
too
close
to
the
sun
and
cracked
from
the
heat.
A
thousand
thousand
dragons
poured
forth,
and
drank
the
fire
of
the
sun.
That
is
why
dragons
breathe
flame.
One
day
the
other
moon
will
kiss
the
sun
too,
and
then
it
will
crack
and
the
dragons
will
return.”

The
two
Dothraki
girls
giggled
and
laughed.
“You
are
foolish
strawhead
slave,”
Irri
said.
“Moon
is
no
egg.
Moon
is
god,
woman
wife
of
sun.
It
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
Jhiqui
agreed.

Dany’s
skin
was
flushed
and
pink
when
she
climbed
from
the
tub.
Jhiqui
laid
her
down
to
oil
her
body
and
scrape
the
dirt
from
her
pores.
Afterward
Irri
sprinkled
her
with
spiceflower
and
cinnamon.
While
Doreah
brushed
her
hair
until
it
shone
like
spun
silver,
she
thought
about
the
moon,
and
eggs,
and
dragons.

Her
supper
was
a
simple
meal
of
fruit
and
cheese
and
fry
bread,
with
a
jug
of
honeyed
wine
to
wash
it
down.
“Doreah,
stay
and
eat
with
me,”
Dany
commanded
when
she
sent
her
other
handmaids
away.
The
Lysene
girl
had
hair
the
color
of
honey,
and
eyes
like
the
summer
sky.

She
lowered
those
eyes
when
they
were
alone.
“You
honor
me,
Khaleesi,”
she
said,
but
it
was
no
honor,
only
service.
Long
after
the
moon
had
risen,
they
sat
together,
talking.

That
night,
when
Khal
Drogo
came,
Dany
was
waiting
for
him.
He
stood
in
the
door
of
her
tent
and
looked
at
her
with
surprise.
She
rose
slowly
and
opened
her
sleeping
silks
and
let
them
fall
to
the
ground.
“This
night
we
must
go
outside,
my
lord,”
she
told
him,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.

Khal
Drogo
followed
her
out
into
the
moonlight,
the
bells
in
his
hair
tinkling
softly.
A
few
yards
from
her
tent
was
a
bed
of
soft
grass,
and
it
was
there
that
Dany
drew
him
down.
When
he
tried
to
turn
her
over,
she
put
a
hand
on
his
chest.
“No,”
she
said.
“This
night
I
would
look
on
your
face.”

There
is
no
privacy
in
the
heart
of
the
khalasar.
Dany
felt
the
eyes
on
her
as
she
undressed
him,
heard
the
soft
voices
as
she
did
the
things
that
Doreah
had
told
her
to
do.
It
was
nothing
to
her.
Was
she
not
khaleesi?
His
were
the
only
eyes
that
mattered,
and
when
she
mounted
him
she
saw
something
there
that
she
had
never
seen
before.
She
rode
him
as
fiercely
as
ever
she
had
ridden
her
silver,
and
when
the
moment
of
his
pleasure
came,
Khal
Drogo
called
out
her
name.

They
were
on
the
far
side
of
the
Dothraki
sea
when
Jhiqui
brushed
the
soft
swell
of
Dany’s
stomach
with
her
fingers
and
said,
“Khaleesi,
you
are
with
child.”

“I
know,”
Dany
told
her.

It
was
her
fourteenth
name
day.





BRAN

In
the
yard
below,
Rickon
ran
with
the
wolves.

Bran
watched
from
his
window
seat.
Wherever
the
boy
went,
Grey
Wind
was
there
first,
loping
ahead
to
cut
him
off,
until
Rickon
saw
him,
screamed
in
delight,
and
went
pelting
off
in
another
direction.
Shaggydog
ran
at
his
heels,
spinning
and
snapping
if
the
other
wolves
came
too
close.
His
fur
had
darkened
until
he
was
all
black,
and
his
eyes
were
green
fire.
Bran’s
Summer
came
last.
He
was
silver
and
smoke,
with
eyes
of
yellow
gold
that
saw
all
there
was
to
see.
Smaller
than
Grey
Wind,
and
more
wary.
Bran
thought
he
was
the
smartest
of
the
litter.
He
could
hear
his
brother’s
breathless
laughter
as
Rickon
dashed
across
the
hard-packed
earth
on
little
baby
legs.

His
eyes
stung.
He
wanted
to
be
down
there,
laughing
and
running.
Angry
at
the
thought,
Bran
knuckled
away
the
tears
before
they
could
fall.
His
eighth
name
day
had
come
and
gone.
He
was
almost
a
man
grown
now,
too
old
to
cry.

“It
was
just
a
lie,”
he
said
bitterly,
remembering
the
crow
from
his
dream.
“I
can’t
fly.
I
can’t
even
run.”

“Crows
are
all
liars,”
Old
Nan
agreed,
from
the
chair
where
she
sat
doing
her
needlework.
“I
know
a
story
about
a
crow.”

“I
don’t
want
any
more
stories,”
Bran
snapped,
his
voice
petulant.
He
had
liked
Old
Nan
and
her
stories
once.
Before.
But
it
was
different
now.
They
left
her
with
him
all
day
now,
to
watch
over
him
and
clean
him
and
keep
him
from
being
lonely,
but
she
just
made
it
worse.
“I
hate
your
stupid
stories.”

The
old
woman
smiled
at
him
toothlessly.
“My
stories?
No,
my
little
lord,
not
mine.
The
stories
are,
before
me
and
after
me,
before
you
too.”

She
was
a
very
ugly
old
woman,
Bran
thought
spitefully;
shrunken
and
wrinkled,
almost
blind,
too
weak
to
climb
stairs,
with
only
a
few
wisps
of
white
hair
left
to
cover
a
mottled
pink
scalp.
No
one
really
knew
how
old
she
was,
but
his
father
said
she’d
been
called
Old
Nan
even
when
he
was
a
boy.
She
was
the
oldest
person
in
Winterfell
for
certain,
maybe
the
oldest
person
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Nan
had
come
to
the
castle
as
a
wet
nurse
for
a
Brandon
Stark
whose
mother
had
died
birthing
him.
He
had
been
an
older
brother
of
Lord
Rickard,
Bran’s
grandfather,
or
perhaps
a
younger
brother,
or
a
brother
to
Lord
Rickard’s
father.
Sometimes
Old
Nan
told
it
one
way
and
sometimes
another.
In
all
the
stories
the
little
boy
died
at
three
of
a
summer
chill,
but
Old
Nan
stayed
on
at
Winterfell
with
her
own
children.
She
had
lost
both
her
sons
to
the
war
when
King
Robert
won
the
throne,
and
her
grandson
was
killed
on
the
walls
of
Pyke
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion.
Her
daughters
had
long
ago
married
and
moved
away
and
died.
All
that
was
left
of
her
own
blood
was
Hodor,
the
simpleminded
giant
who
worked
in
the
stables,
but
Old
Nan
just
lived
on
and
on,
doing
her
needlework
and
telling
her
stories.

“I
don’t
care
whose
stories
they
are,”
Bran
told
her,
“I
hate
them.”
He
didn’t
want
stories
and
he
didn’t
want
Old
Nan.
He
wanted
his
mother
and
father.
He
wanted
to
go
running
with
Summer
loping
beside
him.
He
wanted
to
climb
the
broken
tower
and
feed
corn
to
the
crows.
He
wanted
to
ride
his
pony
again
with
his
brothers.
He
wanted
it
to
be
the
way
it
had
been
before.

“I
know
a
story
about
a
boy
who
hated
stories,”
Old
Nan
said
with
her
stupid
little
smile,
her
needles
moving
all
the
while,
click
click
click,
until
Bran
was
ready
to
scream
at
her.

It
would
never
be
the
way
it
had
been,
he
knew.
The
crow
had
tricked
him
into
flying,
but
when
he
woke
up
he
was
broken
and
the
world
was
changed.
They
had
all
left
him,
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
sisters
and
even
his
bastard
brother
Jon.
His
father
had
promised
he
would
ride
a
real
horse
to
King’s
Landing,
but
they’d
gone
without
him.
Maester
Luwin
had
sent
a
bird
after
Lord
Eddard
with
a
message,
and
another
to
Mother
and
a
third
to
Jon
on
the
Wall,
but
there
had
been
no
answers.
“Ofttimes
the
birds
are
lost,
child,”
the
maester
had
told
him.
“There’s
many
a
mile
and
many
a
hawk
between
here
and
King’s
Landing,
the
message
may
not
have
reached
them.”
Yet
to
Bran
it
felt
as
if
they
had
all
died
while
he
had
slept…
or
perhaps
Bran
had
died,
and
they
had
forgotten
him.
Jory
and
Ser
Rodrik
and
Vayon
Poole
had
gone
too,
and
Hullen
and
Harwin
and
Fat
Tom
and
a
quarter
of
the
guard.

Only
Robb
and
baby
Rickon
were
still
here,
and
Robb
was
changed.
He
was
Robb
the
Lord
now,
or
trying
to
be.
He
wore
a
real
sword
and
never
smiled.
His
days
were
spent
drilling
the
guard
and
practicing
his
swordplay,
making
the
yard
ring
with
the
sound
of
steel
as
Bran
watched
forlornly
from
his
window.
At
night
he
closeted
himself
with
Maester
Luwin,
talking
or
going
over
account
books.
Sometimes
he
would
ride
out
with
Hallis
Mollen
and
be
gone
for
days
at
a
time,
visiting
distant
holdfasts.
Whenever
he
was
away
more
than
a
day,
Rickon
would
cry
and
ask
Bran
if
Robb
was
ever
coming
back.
Even
when
he
was
home
at
Winterfell,
Robb
the
Lord
seemed
to
have
more
time
for
Hallis
Mollen
and
Theon
Greyjoy
than
he
ever
did
for
his
brothers.

“I
could
tell
you
the
story
about
Brandon
the
Builder,”
Old
Nan
said.
“That
was
always
your
favorite.”

Thousands
and
thousands
of
years
ago,
Brandon
the
Builder
had
raised
Winterfell,
and
some
said
the
Wall.
Bran
knew
the
story,
but
it
had
never
been
his
favorite.
Maybe
one
of
the
other
Brandons
had
liked
that
story.
Sometimes
Nan
would
talk
to
him
as
if
he
were
her
Brandon,
the
baby
she
had
nursed
all
those
years
ago,
and
sometimes
she
confused
him
with
his
uncle
Brandon,
who
was
killed
by
the
Mad
King
before
Bran
was
even
born.
She
had
lived
so
long,
Mother
had
told
him
once,
that
all
the
Brandon
Starks
had
become
one
person
in
her
head.

“That’s
not
my
favorite,”
he
said.
“My
favorites
were
the
scary
ones.”
He
heard
some
sort
of
commotion
outside
and
turned
back
to
the
window.
Rickon
was
running
across
the
yard
toward
the
gatehouse,
the
wolves
following
him,
but
the
tower
faced
the
wrong
way
for
Bran
to
see
what
was
happening.
He
smashed
a
fist
on
his
thigh
in
frustration
and
felt
nothing.

“Oh,
my
sweet
summer
child,”
Old
Nan
said
quietly,
“what
do
you
know
of
fear?
Fear
is
for
the
winter,
my
little
lord,
when
the
snows
fall
a
hundred
feet
deep
and
the
ice
wind
comes
howling
out
of
the
north.
Fear
is
for
the
long
night,
when
the
sun
hides
its
face
for
years
at
a
time,
and
little
children
are
born
and
live
and
die
all
in
darkness
while
the
direwolves
grow
gaunt
and
hungry,
and
the
white
walkers
move
through
the
woods.”

“You
mean
the
Others,”
Bran
said
querulously.

“The
Others,”
Old
Nan
agreed.
“Thousands
and
thousands
of
years
ago,
a
winter
fell
that
was
cold
and
hard
and
endless
beyond
all
memory
of
man.
There
came
a
night
that
lasted
a
generation,
and
kings
shivered
and
died
in
their
castles
even
as
the
swineherds
in
their
hovels.
Women
smothered
their
children
rather
than
see
them
starve,
and
cried,
and
felt
their
tears
freeze
on
their
cheeks.”
Her
voice
and
her
needles
fell
silent,
and
she
glanced
up
at
Bran
with
pale,
filmy
eyes
and
asked,
“So,
child.
This
is
the
sort
of
story
you
like?”

“Well,”
Bran
said
reluctantly,
“yes,
only…”

Old
Nan
nodded.
“In
that
darkness,
the
Others
came
for
the
first
time,”
she
said
as
her
needles
went
click
click
click.
“They
were
cold
things,
dead
things,
that
hated
iron
and
fire
and
the
touch
of
the
sun,
and
every
creature
with
hot
blood
in
its
veins.
They
swept
over
holdfasts
and
cities
and
kingdoms,
felled
heroes
and
armies
by
the
score,
riding
their
pale
dead
horses
and
leading
hosts
of
the
slain.
All
the
swords
of
men
could
not
stay
their
advance,
and
even
maidens
and
suckling
babes
found
no
pity
in
them.
They
hunted
the
maids
through
frozen
forests,
and
fed
their
dead
servants
on
the
flesh
of
human
children.”

Her
voice
had
dropped
very
low,
almost
to
a
whisper,
and
Bran
found
himself
leaning
forward
to
listen.

“Now
these
were
the
days
before
the
Andals
came,
and
long
before
the
women
fled
across
the
narrow
sea
from
the
cities
of
the
Rhoyne,
and
the
hundred
kingdoms
of
those
times
were
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men,
who
had
taken
these
lands
from
the
children
of
the
forest.
Yet
here
and
there
in
the
fastness
of
the
woods
the
children
still
lived
in
their
wooden
cities
and
hollow
hills,
and
the
faces
in
the
trees
kept
watch.
So
as
cold
and
death
filled
the
earth,
the
last
hero
determined
to
seek
out
the
children,
in
the
hopes
that
their
ancient
magics
could
win
back
what
the
armies
of
men
had
lost.
He
set
out
into
the
dead
lands
with
a
sword,
a
horse,
a
dog,
and
a
dozen
companions.
For
years
he
searched,
until
he
despaired
of
ever
finding
the
children
of
the
forest
in
their
secret
cities.
One
by
one
his
friends
died,
and
his
horse,
and
finally
even
his
dog,
and
his
sword
froze
so
hard
the
blade
snapped
when
he
tried
to
use
it.
And
the
Others
smelled
the
hot
blood
in
him,
and
came
silent
on
his
trail,
stalking
him
with
packs
of
pale
white
spiders
big
as
hounds—”

The
door
opened
with
a
bang,
and
Bran’s
heart
leapt
up
into
his
mouth
in
sudden
fear,
but
it
was
only
Maester
Luwin,
with
Hodor
looming
in
the
stairway
behind
him.
“Hodor!”
the
stableboy
announced,
as
was
his
custom,
smiling
hugely
at
them
all.

Maester
Luwin
was
not
smiling.
“We
have
visitors,”
he
announced,
“and
your
presence
is
required,
Bran.”

“I’m
listening
to
a
story
now,”
Bran
complained.

“Stories
wait,
my
little
lord,
and
when
you
come
back
to
them,
why,
there
they
are,”
Old
Nan
said.
“Visitors
are
not
so
patient,
and
ofttimes
they
bring
stories
of
their
own.”

“Who
is
it?”
Bran
asked
Maester
Luwin.

“Tyrion
Lannister,
and
some
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
with
word
from
your
brother
Jon.
Robb
is
meeting
with
them
now.
Hodor,
will
you
help
Bran
down
to
the
hall?”

“Hodor!”
Hodor
agreed
happily.
He
ducked
to
get
his
great
shaggy
head
under
the
door.
Hodor
was
nearly
seven
feet
tall.
It
was
hard
to
believe
that
he
was
the
same
blood
as
Old
Nan.
Bran
wondered
if
he
would
shrivel
up
as
small
as
his
great-grandmother
when
he
was
old.
It
did
not
seem
likely,
even
if
Hodor
lived
to
be
a
thousand.

Hodor
lifted
Bran
as
easy
as
if
he
were
a
bale
of
hay,
and
cradled
him
against
his
massive
chest.
He
always
smelled
faintly
of
horses,
but
it
was
not
a
bad
smell.
His
arms
were
thick
with
muscle
and
matted
with
brown
hair.
“Hodor,”
he
said
again.
Theon
Greyjoy
had
once
commented
that
Hodor
did
not
know
much,
but
no
one
could
doubt
that
he
knew
his
name.
Old
Nan
had
cackled
like
a
hen
when
Bran
told
her
that,
and
confessed
that
Hodor’s
real
name
was
Walder.
No
one
knew
where
“Hodor”
had
come
from,
she
said,
but
when
he
started
saying
it,
they
started
calling
him
by
it.
It
was
the
only
word
he
had.

They
left
Old
Nan
in
the
tower
room
with
her
needles
and
her
memories.
Hodor
hummed
tunelessly
as
he
carried
Bran
down
the
steps
and
through
the
gallery,
with
Maester
Luwin
following
behind,
hurrying
to
keep
up
with
the
stableboy’s
long
strides.

Robb
was
seated
in
Father’s
high
seat,
wearing
ringmail
and
boiled
leather
and
the
stern
face
of
Robb
the
Lord.
Theon
Greyjoy
and
Hallis
Mollen
stood
behind
him.
A
dozen
guardsmen
lined
the
grey
stone
walls
beneath
tall
narrow
windows.
In
the
center
of
the
room
the
dwarf
stood
with
his
servants,
and
four
strangers
in
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Bran
could
sense
the
anger
in
the
hall
the
moment
that
Hodor
carried
him
through
the
doors.

“Any
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
is
welcome
here
at
Winterfell
for
as
long
as
he
wishes
to
stay,”
Robb
was
saying
with
the
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord.
His
sword
was
across
his
knees,
the
steel
bare
for
all
the
world
to
see.
Even
Bran
knew
what
it
meant
to
greet
a
guest
with
an
unsheathed
sword.

“Any
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch,”
the
dwarf
repeated,
“but
not
me,
do
I
take
your
meaning,
boy?”

Robb
stood
and
pointed
at
the
little
man
with
his
sword.
“I
am
the
lord
here
while
my
mother
and
father
are
away,
Lannister.
I
am
not
your
boy.”

“If
you
are
a
lord,
you
might
learn
a
lord’s
courtesy,”
the
little
man
replied,
ignoring
the
sword
point
in
his
face.
“Your
bastard
brother
has
all
your
father’s
graces,
it
would
seem.”

“Jon,”
Bran
gasped
out
from
Hodor’s
arms.

The
dwarf
turned
to
look
at
him.
“So
it
is
true,
the
boy
lives.
I
could
scarce
believe
it.
You
Starks
are
hard
to
kill.”

“You
Lannisters
had
best
remember
that,”
Robb
said,
lowering
his
sword.
“Hodor,
bring
my
brother
here.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
said,
and
he
trotted
forward
smiling
and
set
Bran
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Starks,
where
the
Lords
of
Winterfell
had
sat
since
the
days
when
they
called
themselves
the
Kings
in
the
North.
The
seat
was
cold
stone,
polished
smooth
by
countless
bottoms;
the
carved
heads
of
direwolves
snarled
on
the
ends
of
its
massive
arms.
Bran
clasped
them
as
he
sat,
his
useless
legs
dangling.
The
great
seat
made
him
feel
half
a
baby.

Robb
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder.
“You
said
you
had
business
with
Bran.
Well,
here
he
is,
Lannister.”

Bran
was
uncomfortably
aware
of
Tyrion
Lannister’s
eyes.
One
was
black
and
one
was
green,
and
both
were
looking
at
him,
studying
him,
weighing
him.
“I
am
told
you
were
quite
the
climber,
Bran,”
the
little
man
said
at
last.
“Tell
me,
how
is
it
you
happened
to
fall
that
day?”

“I
never,”
Bran
insisted.
He
never
fell,
never
never
never.

“The
child
does
not
remember
anything
of
the
fall,
or
the
climb
that
came
before
it,”
said
Maester
Luwin
gently.

“Curious,”
said
Tyrion
Lannister.

“My
brother
is
not
here
to
answer
questions,
Lannister,”
Robb
said
curtly.
“Do
your
business
and
be
on
your
way.”

“I
have
a
gift
for
you,”
the
dwarf
said
to
Bran.
“Do
you
like
to
ride,
boy?”

Maester
Luwin
came
forward.
“My
lord,
the
child
has
lost
the
use
of
his
legs.
He
cannot
sit
a
horse.”

“Nonsense,”
said
Lannister.
“With
the
right
horse
and
the
right
saddle,
even
a
cripple
can
ride.”

The
word
was
a
knife
through
Bran’s
heart.
He
felt
tears
come
unbidden
to
his
eyes.
“I’m
not
a
cripple!”

“Then
I
am
not
a
dwarf,”
the
dwarf
said
with
a
twist
of
his
mouth.
“My
father
will
rejoice
to
hear
it.”
Greyjoy
laughed.

“What
sort
of
horse
and
saddle
are
you
suggesting?”
Maester
Luwin
asked.

“A
smart
horse,”
Lannister
replied.
“The
boy
cannot
use
his
legs
to
command
the
animal,
so
you
must
shape
the
horse
to
the
rider,
teach
it
to
respond
to
the
reins,
to
the
voice.
I
would
begin
with
an
unbroken
yearling,
with
no
old
training
to
be
unlearned.”
He
drew
a
rolled
paper
from
his
belt.
“Give
this
to
your
saddler.
He
will
provide
the
rest.”

Maester
Luwin
took
the
paper
from
the
dwarfs
hand,
curious
as
a
small
grey
squirrel.
He
unrolled
it,
studied
it.
“I
see.
You
draw
nicely,
my
lord.
Yes,
this
ought
to
work.
I
should
have
thought
of
this
myself.”

“It
came
easier
to
me,
Maester.
It
is
not
terribly
unlike
my
own
saddles.”

“Will
I
truly
be
able
to
ride?”
Bran
asked.
He
wanted
to
believe
them,
but
he
was
afraid.
Perhaps
it
was
just
another
lie.
The
crow
had
promised
him
that
he
could
fly.

“You
will,”
the
dwarf
told
him.
“And
I
swear
to
you,
boy,
on
horseback
you
will
be
as
tall
as
any
of
them.”

Robb
Stark
seemed
puzzled.
“Is
this
some
trap,
Lannister?
What’s
Bran
to
you?
Why
should
you
want
to
help
him?”

“Your
brother
Jon
asked
it
of
me.
And
I
have
a
tender
spot
in
my
heart
for
cripples
and
bastards
and
broken
things.”
Tyrion
Lannister
placed
a
hand
over
his
heart
and
grinned.

The
door
to
the
yard
flew
open.
Sunlight
came
streaming
across
the
hall
as
Rickon
burst
in,
breathless.
The
direwolves
were
with
him.
The
boy
stopped
by
the
door,
wide-eyed,
but
the
wolves
came
on.
Their
eyes
found
Lannister,
or
perhaps
they
caught
his
scent.
Summer
began
to
growl
first.
Grey
Wind
picked
it
up.
They
padded
toward
the
little
man,
one
from
the
right
and
one
from
the
left.

“The
wolves
do
not
like
your
smell,
Lannister,”
Theon
Greyioy
commented.

“Perhaps
it’s
time
I
took
my
leave,”
Tyrion
said.
He
took
a
step
backward…
and
Shaggydog
came
out
of
the
shadows
behind
him,
snarling.
Lannister
recoiled,
and
Summer
lunged
at
him
from
the
other
side.
He
reeled
away,
unsteady
on
his
feet,
and
Grey
Wind
snapped
at
his
arm,
teeth
ripping
at
his
sleeve
and
tearing
loose
a
scrap
of
cloth.

“No!”
Bran
shouted
from
the
high
seat
as
Lannister’s
men
reached
for
their
steel.
“Summer,
here.
Summer,
to
me!”

The
direwolf
heard
the
voice,
glanced
at
Bran,
and
again
at
Lannister.
He
crept
backward,
away
from
the
little
man,
and
settled
down
below
Bran’s
dangling
feet.

Robb
had
been
holding
his
breath.
He
let
it
out
with
a
sigh
and
called,
“Grey
Wind.”
His
direwolf
moved
to
him,
swift
and
silent.
Now
there
was
only
Shaggydog,
rumbling
at
the
small
man,
his
eyes
burning
like
green
fire.

“Rickon,
call
him,”
Bran
shouted
to
his
baby
brother,
and
Rickon
remembered
himself
and
screamed,
“Home,
Shaggy,
home
now.”
The
black
wolf
gave
Lannister
one
final
snarl
and
bounded
off
to
Rickon,
who
hugged
him
tightly
around
the
neck.

Tyrion
Lannister
undid
his
scarf,
mopped
at
his
brow,
and
said
in
a
flat
voice,
“How
interesting.”

“Are
you
well,
my
lord?”
asked
one
of
his
men,
his
sword
in
hand.
He
glanced
nervously
at
the
direwolves
as
he
spoke.

“My
sleeve
is
torn
and
my
breeches
are
unaccountably
damp,
but
nothing
was
harmed
save
my
dignity.”

Even
Robb
looked
shaken.
“The
wolves…
I
don’t
know
why
they
did
that…”

“No
doubt
they
mistook
me
for
dinner.”
Lannister
bowed
stiffly
to
Bran.
“I
thank
you
for
calling
them
off,
young
ser.
I
promise
you,
they
would
have
found
me
quite
indigestible.
And
now
I
will
be
leaving,
truly.”

“A
moment,
my
lord,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
He
moved
to
Robb
and
they
huddled
close
together,
whispering.
Bran
tried
to
hear
what
they
were
saying,
but
their
voices
were
too
low.

Robb
Stark
finally
sheathed
his
sword.
“I…
I
may
have
been
hasty
with
you,”
he
said.
“You’ve
done
Bran
a
kindness,
and,
well…”
Robb
composed
himself
with
an
effort.
“The
hospitality
of
Winterfell
is
yours
if
you
wish
it,
Lannister.”

“Spare
me
your
false
courtesies,
boy.
You
do
not
love
me
and
you
do
not
want
me
here.
I
saw
an
inn
outside
your
walls,
in
the
winter
town.
I’ll
find
a
bed
there,
and
both
of
us
will
sleep
easier.
For
a
few
coppers
I
may
even
find
a
comely
wench
to
warm
the
sheets
for
me.”
He
spoke
to
one
of
the
black
brothers,
an
old
man
with
a
twisted
back
and
a
tangled
beard.
“Yoren,
we
go
south
at
daybreak.
You
will
find
me
on
the
road,
no
doubt.”
With
that
he
made
his
exit,
struggling
across
the
hall
on
his
short
legs,
past
Rickon
and
out
the
door.
His
men
followed.

The
four
of
the
Night’s
Watch
remained.
Robb
turned
to
them
uncertainly.
“I
have
had
rooms
prepared,
and
you’ll
find
no
lack
of
hot
water
to
wash
off
the
dust
of
the
road.
I
hope
you
will
honor
us
at
table
tonight.”
He
spoke
the
words
so
awkwardly
that
even
Bran
took
note;
it
was
a
speech
he
had
learned,
not
words
from
the
heart,
but
the
black
brothers
thanked
him
all
the
same.

Summer
followed
them
up
the
tower
steps
as
Hodor
carried
Bran
back
to
his
bed.
Old
Nan
was
asleep
in
her
chair.
Hodor
said
“Hodor,”
gathered
up
his
great-grandmother,
and
carried
her
off,
snoring
softly,
while
Bran
lay
thinking.
Robb
had
promised
that
he
could
feast
with
the
Night’s
Watch
in
the
Great
Hall.
“Summer,”
he
called.
The
wolf
bounded
up
on
the
bed.
Bran
hugged
him
so
hard
he
could
feel
the
hot
breath
on
his
cheek.
“I
can
ride
now,”
he
whispered
to
his
friend.
“We
can
go
hunting
in
the
woods
soon,
wait
and
see.”
After
a
time
he
slept.

In
his
dream
he
was
climbing
again,
pulling
himself
up
an
ancient
windowless
tower,
his
fingers
forcing
themselves
between
blackened
stones,
his
feet
scrabbling
for
purchase.
Higher
and
higher
he
climbed,
through
the
clouds
and
into
the
night
sky,
and
still
the
tower
rose
before
him.
When
he
paused
to
look
down,
his
head
swam
dizzily
and
he
felt
his
fingers
slipping.
Bran
cried
out
and
clung
for
dear
life.
The
earth
was
a
thousand
miles
beneath
him
and
he
could
not
fly.
He
could
not
fly.
He
waited
until
his
heart
had
stopped
pounding,
until
he
could
breathe,
and
he
began
to
climb
again.
There
was
no
way
to
go
but
up.
Far
above
him,
outlined
against
a
vast
pale
moon,
he
thought
he
could
see
the
shapes
of
gargoyles.
His
arms
were
sore
and
aching,
but
he
dared
not
rest.
He
forced
himself
to
climb
faster.
The
gargoyles
watched
him
ascend.
Their
eyes
glowed
red
as
hot
coals
in
a
brazier.
Perhaps
once
they
had
been
lions,
but
now
they
were
twisted
and
grotesque.
Bran
could
hear
them
whispering
to
each
other
in
soft
stone
voices
terrible
to
hear.
He
must
not
listen,
he
told
himself,
he
must
not
hear,
so
long
as
he
did
not
hear
them
he
was
safe.
But
when
the
gargoyles
pulled
themselves
loose
from
the
stone
and
padded
down
the
side
of
the
tower
to
where
Bran
clung,
he
knew
he
was
not
safe
after
all.
“I
didn’t
hear,”
he
wept
as
they
came
closer
and
closer,
“I
didn’t,
I
didn’t.”

He
woke
gasping,
lost
in
darkness,
and
saw
a
vast
shadow
looming
over
him.
“I
didn’t
hear,”
he
whispered,
trembling
in
fear,
but
then
the
shadow
said
“Hodor,”
and
lit
the
candle
by
the
bedside,
and
Bran
sighed
with
relief.

Hodor
washed
the
sweat
from
him
with
a
warm,
damp
cloth
and
dressed
him
with
deft
and
gentle
hands.
When
it
was
time,
he
carried
him
down
to
the
Great
Hall,
where
a
long
trestle
table
had
been
set
up
near
the
fire.
The
lord’s
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
been
left
empty,
but
Robb
sat
to
the
right
of
it,
with
Bran
across
from
him.
They
ate
suckling
pig
that
night,
and
pigeon
pie,
and
turnips
soaking
in
butter,
and
afterward
the
cook
had
promised
honeycombs.
Summer
snatched
table
scraps
from
Bran’s
hand,
while
Grey
Wind
and
Shaggydog
fought
over
a
bone
in
the
corner.
Winterfell’s
dogs
would
not
come
near
the
hall
now.
Bran
had
found
that
strange
at
first,
but
he
was
growing
used
to
it.

Yoren
was
senior
among
the
black
brothers,
so
the
steward
had
seated
him
between
Robb
and
Maester
Luwin.
The
old
man
had
a
sour
smell,
as
if
he
had
not
washed
in
a
long
time.
He
ripped
at
the
meat
with
his
teeth,
cracked
the
ribs
to
suck
out
the
marrow
from
the
bones,
and
shrugged
at
the
mention
of
Jon
Snow.
“Ser
Alliser’s
bane,”
he
grunted,
and
two
of
his
companions
shared
a
laugh
that
Bran
did
not
understand.
But
when
Robb
asked
for
news
of
their
uncle
Benjen,
the
black
brothers
grew
ominously
quiet.

“What
is
it?”
Bran
asked.

Yoren
wiped
his
fingers
on
his
vest.
“There’s
hard
news,
m’lords,
and
a
cruel
way
to
pay
you
for
your
meat
and
mead,
but
the
man
as
asks
the
question
must
bear
the
answer.
Stark’s
gone.”

One
of
the
other
men
said,
“The
Old
Bear
sent
him
out
to
look
for
Waymar
Royce,
and
he’s
late
returning,
my
lord.”

“Too
long,”
Yoren
said.
“Most
like
he’s
dead.”

“My
uncle
is
not
dead,”
Robb
Stark
said
loudly,
anger
in
his
tones.
He
rose
from
the
bench
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
“Do
you
hear
me?
My
uncle
is
not
dead!”
His
voice
rang
against
the
stone
walls,
and
Bran
was
suddenly
afraid.

Old
sour-smelling
Yoren
looked
up
at
Robb,
unimpressed.
“Whatever
you
say,
m’lord,”
he
said.
He
sucked
at
a
piece
of
meat
between
his
teeth.

The
youngest
of
the
black
brothers
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
seat.
“There’s
not
a
man
on
the
Wall
knows
the
haunted
forest
better
than
Benjen
Stark.
He’ll
find
his
way
back.”

“Well,”
said
Yoren,
“maybe
he
will
and
maybe
he
won’t.
Good
men
have
gone
into
those
woods
before,
and
never
come
out.”

All
Bran
could
think
of
was
Old
Nan’s
story
of
the
Others
and
the
last
hero,
hounded
through
the
white
woods
by
dead
men
and
spiders
big
as
hounds.
He
was
afraid
for
a
moment,
until
he
remembered
how
that
story
ended.
“The
children
will
help
him,”
he
blurted,
“the
children
of
the
forest!”

Theon
Greyjoy
sniggered,
and
Maester
Luwin
said,
“Bran,
the
children
of
the
forest
have
been
dead
and
gone
for
thousands
of
years.
All
that
is
left
of
them
are
the
faces
in
the
trees.”

“Down
here,
might
be
that’s
true,
Maester,”
Yoren
said,
“but
up
past
the
Wall,
who’s
to
say?
Up
there,
a
man
can’t
always
tell
what’s
alive
and
what’s
dead.”

That
night,
after
the
plates
had
been
cleared,
Robb
carried
Bran
up
to
bed
himself.
Grey
Wind
led
the
way,
and
Summer
came
close
behind.
His
brother
was
strong
for
his
age,
and
Bran
was
as
light
as
a
bundle
of
rags,
but
the
stairs
were
steep
and
dark,
and
Robb
was
breathing
hard
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top.

He
put
Bran
into
bed,
covered
him
with
blankets,
and
blew
out
the
candle.
For
a
time
Robb
sat
beside
him
in
the
dark.
Bran
wanted
to
talk
to
him,
but
he
>>>>>>> asd
did
not
know
what
to
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
do.
He
knelt
and
scooped
the
old
man
up
and
carried
him
below.
No
one
had
ever
called
him
strong,
and
the
rain
had
soaked
through
Maester
Aemon’s
blacks
and
made
him
twice
as
heavy,
but
even
so,
he
weighed
no
more
than
a
child.

When
he
shoved
into
the
cabin
with
Aemon
in
his
arms,
he
found
that
Gilly
had
let
all
the
candles
gutter
out.
The
babe
was
asleep
and
she
was
curled
up
in
a
corner,
sobbing
softly
in
the
folds
of
the
big
black
cloak
that
Sam
had
given
her.
“Help
me,”
he
said
urgently.
“Help
me
dry
him
off
and
get
him
warm.”

She
rose
at
once,
and
together
they
got
the
old
maester
out
of
his
wet
clothes
and
buried
him
beneath
a
pile
of
furs.
His
skin
was
damp
and
cold,
though,
clammy
to
the
touch.
“You
get
in
with
him,”
Sam
told
Gilly.
“Hold
him.
Warm
him
with
your
body.
We
have
to
warm
him
up.”
She
did
that
too,
never
saying
a
word,
all
the
while
still
sniffling.
“Where’s
Dareon?”
asked
Sam.
“We’d
all
be
warmer
if
we
were
together.
He
needs
to
be
here
too.”
He
was
headed
back
up
top
to
find
the
singer
when
the
deck
rose
up
beneath
him,
then
fell
away
beneath
his
feet.
Gilly
wailed,
Sam
slammed
down
hard
and
lost
his
legs,
and
the
babe
woke
screaming.

The
next
roll
of
the
ship
came
as
he
was
struggling
back
to
his
feet.
It
threw
Gilly
into
his
arms,
and
the
wildling
girl
clung
to
him
so
fiercely
that
Sam
could
hardly
breathe.
“Don’t
you
be
frightened,”
he
told
her.
“This
is
just
an
adventure.
One
day
you’ll
tell
your
son
this
tale.”
That
only
made
her
dig
her
nails
into
his
arm.
She
shuddered,
her
whole
body
shaking
with
the
violence
of
her
sobs.
Whatever
I
say
just
makes
her
worse.
He
held
her
tightly,
uncomfortably
aware
of
her
breasts
pressing
up
against
him.
As
frightened
as
he
was,
somehow
that
was
enough
to
make
him
stiff.
She’ll
feel
it,
he
thought,
ashamed,
but
if
she
did,
she
gave
no
sign,
only
clung
to
him
the
harder.

The
days
ran
together
after
that.
They
never
saw
the
sun.
The
days
were
grey
and
the
nights
black,
except
when
lightning
lit
the
sky
above
the
peaks
of
Skagos.
All
of
them
were
starved
yet
none
could
eat.
The
captain
broached
a
cask
of
firewine
to
fortify
the
oarsmen.
Sam
tried
a
cup
and
sighed
as
hot
snakes
wriggled
down
his
throat
and
through
his
chest.
Dareon
took
a
liking
to
the
drink
as
well,
and
was
seldom
sober
thereafter.

The
sails
went
up,
the
sails
came
down,
and
one
ripped
free
of
the
mast
and
flew
away
like
a
great
grey
bird.
As
Blackbird
rounded
the
south
coast
of
Skagos,
they
spotted
the
wreckage
of
a
galley
on
the
rocks.
Some
of
her
crew
had
washed
up
on
the
shore,
and
the
rooks
and
crabs
had
gathered
to
pay
them
homage.
“Too
bloody
close,”
grumbled
Old
Tattersalt
when
he
saw.
“One
good
blow,
and
we’ll
be
breaking
up
aside
them.”
Exhausted
as
they
were,
his
rowers
bent
to
their
oars
again,
and
the
ship
clawed
south
toward
the
narrow
sea,
till
Skagos
dwindled
to
no
more
than
a
few
dark
shapes
in
the
sky
that
might
have
been
thunderheads,
or
the
tops
of
tall
black
mountains,
or
both.
After
that,
they
had
eight
days
and
seven
nights
of
clear,
smooth
sailing.

Then
came
more
storms,
worse
than
before.

Was
it
three
storms,
or
only
one,
broken
up
by
lulls?
Sam
never
knew,
though
he
tried
desperately
to
care.
“What
does
it
matter?”
Dareon
screamed
at
him
once,
when
all
of
them
were
huddled
in
the
cabin.
It
doesn’t,
Sam
wanted
to
tell
him,
but
so
long
as
I’m
thinking
about
that
I’m
not
thinking
about
drowning
or
being
sick
or
Maester
Aemon’s
shivering.
“It
doesn’t,”
he
managed
to
squeak,
but
the
thunder
drowned
out
all
the
rest
of
it,
and
the
deck
lurched
and
knocked
him
sideways.
Gilly
was
sobbing.
The
babe
was
shrieking.
And
up
top
he
could
hear
Old
Tattersalt
bellowing
at
his
crew,
the
ragged
captain
who
never
spoke
at
all.

I
hate
the
sea,
Sam
thought,
I
hate
the
sea,
I
hate
the
sea,
I
hate
the
sea.
The
next
lightning
flash
was
so
bright
it
lit
the
cabin
through
the
seams
in
the
planking
overhead.
This
is
a
good
sound
ship,
a
good
sound
ship,
a
good
ship,
he
told
himself.
It
will
not
sink.
I
am
not
afraid.

During
one
of
the
lulls
between
the
gales,
as
Sam
clung
white-knuckled
to
the
rail
wanting
desperately
to
retch,
he
heard
some
of
the
crew
muttering
that
this
was
what
came
of
bringing
a
woman
aboard
ship,
and
a
wildling
woman
at
that.
“Fucked
her
own
father,”
Sam
heard
one
man
say,
as
the
wind
was
rising
once
again.
“Worse
than
whoring,
that.
Worse
than
anything.
We’ll
all
drown
unless
we
get
rid
of
her,
and
that
abomination
that
she
whelped.”

Sam
dared
not
confront
them.
They
were
older
men,
hard
and
sinewy,
their
arms
and
shoulders
thickened
by
years
at
the
oars.
But
he
made
certain
that
his
knife
was
sharp,
and
whenever
Gilly
left
the
cabin
to
make
water,
he
went
with
her.

Even
Dareon
had
no
good
to
say
about
the
wildling
girl.
Once,
at
Sam’s
urging,
the
singer
played
a
lullaby
to
soothe
the
babe,
but
partway
through
the
first
verse
Gilly
began
to
sob
inconsolably.
“Seven
bloody
hells,”
Dareon
snapped,
“can’t
you
even
stop
weeping
long
enough
to
hear
a
song?”

“Just
play,”
Sam
pleaded,
“just
sing
the
song
for
her.”

“She
doesn’t
need
a
song,”
said
Dareon.
“She
needs
a
good
spanking,
or
maybe
a
hard
fuck.
Get
out
of
my
way,
Slayer.”
He
shoved
Sam
aside
and
went
from
the
cabin
to
find
some
solace
in
a
cup
of
firewine
and
the
rough
brotherhood
of
the
oars.

Sam
was
at
his
wit’s
end
by
then.
He
had
almost
gotten
used
to
the
smells,
but
between
the
storms
and
Gilly’s
sobbing
he
had
not
slept
for
days.
“Isn’t
there
something
you
can
give
her?”
he
asked
Maester
Aemon
very
softly,
when
he
saw
that
the
old
man
was
awake.
“Some
herb
or
potion,
so
she
won’t
be
so
afraid?”

“It
is
not
fear
you
hear,”
the
old
man
told
him.
“That
is
the
sound
of
grief,
and
there
is
no
potion
for
that.
Let
her
tears
run
their
course,
Sam.
You
cannot
stem
the
flow.”

Sam
had
not
understood.
“She’s
going
to
a
safe
place.
A
warm
place.
Why
should
she
be
grieving?”

“Sam,”
the
old
man
whispered,
“you
have
two
good
eyes,
and
yet
you
do
not
see.
She
is
a
mother
grieving
for
her
child.”

“He’s
greensick,
that’s
all.
We’re
all
greensick.
Once
we
make
port
in
Braavos...”

“...the
babe
will
still
be
Dalla’s
son,
and
not
the
child
of
her
body.”

It
took
Sam
a
moment
to
grasp
what
Aemon
was
suggesting.
“That
couldn’t...
she
wouldn’t...
of
course
he’s
hers.
Gilly
would
never
have
left
the
Wall
without
her
son.
She
loves
him.”

“She
nursed
them
both
and
loved
them
both,”
said
Aemon,
“but
not
alike.
No
mother
loves
all
her
children
the
same,
not
even
the
Mother
Above.
Gilly
did
not
leave
the
child
willingly,
I
am
certain.
What
threats
the
Lord
Commander
made,
what
promises,
I
can
only
guess...
but
threats
and
promises
there
surely
were.”

“No.
No,
that’s
wrong.
Jon
would
never...”

“Jon
would
never.
Lord
Snow
did.
Sometimes
there
is
no
happy
choice,
Sam,
only
one
less
grievous
than
the
others.”

No
happy
choice.
Sam
thought
of
all
the
trials
that
he
and
Gilly
suffered,
Craster’s
Keep
and
the
death
of
the
Old
Bear,
snow
and
ice
and
freezing
winds,
days
and
days
and
days
of
walking,
the
wights
at
Whitetree,
Coldhands
and
the
tree
of
ravens,
the
Wall,
the
Wall,
the
Wall,
the
Black
Gate
beneath
the
earth.
What
had
it
all
been
for?
No
happy
choices
and
no
happy
endings.

He
wanted
to
scream.
He
wanted
to
howl
and
sob
and
shake
and
curl
up
in
a
little
ball
and
whimper.
He
switched
the
babes,
he
told
himself.
He
switched
the
babes
to
protect
the
little
prince,
to
keep
him
away
from
Lady
Melisandre’s
fires,
away
from
her
red
god.
If
she
burns
Gilly’s
boy,
who
will
care?
No
one
but
Gilly.
He
was
only
Craster’s
whelp,
an
abomination
born
of
incest,
not
the
son
of
the
King-beyond-the-Wall.
He’s
no
good
for
a
hostage,
no
good
for
a
sacrifice,
no
good
for
anything,
he
doesn’t
even
have
a
name.

Wordless,
Sam
staggered
up
onto
the
deck
to
retch,
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
belly
to
bring
up.
Night
had
come
upon
them,
a
strange
still
night
such
as
they
had
not
seen
for
many
days.
The
sea
was
black
as
glass.
At
the
oars,
the
rowers
rested.
One
or
two
were
sleeping
where
they
sat.
The
wind
was
in
the
sails,
and
to
the
north
Sam
could
even
see
a
scattering
of
stars,
and
the
red
wanderer
the
free
folk
called
the
Thief.
That
ought
to
be
my
star,
Sam
thought
miserably.
I
helped
to
make
Jon
Lord
Commander,
and
I
brought
him
Gilly
and
the
babe.
There
are
no
happy
endings.

“Slayer.”
Dareon
appeared
beside
him,
oblivious
to
Sam’s
pain.
“A
sweet
night,
for
once.
Look,
the
stars
are
coming
out.
We
might
even
get
a
bit
of
moon.
Might
be
the
worst
is
done.”

“No.”
Sam
wiped
his
nose,
and
pointed
south
with
a
fat
finger,
toward
the
gathering
darkness.
“There,”
he
said.
No
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
lightning
flashed,
sudden
and
silent
and
blinding
bright.
The
distant
clouds
glowed
for
half
a
heartbeat,
mountains
heaped
on
mountains,
purple
and
red
and
yellow,
taller
than
the
world.
“The
worst
isn’t
done.
The
worst
is
just
beginning,
and
there
are
no
happy
endings.”

“Gods
be
good,”
said
Dareon,
laughing.
“Slayer,
you
are
such
a
craven.”





JAIME

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
had
entered
the
city
on
a
stallion,
his
enameled
crimson
armor
polished
and
gleaming,
bright
with
gems
and
goldwork.
He
left
it
in
a
tall
wagon
draped
with
crimson
banners,
with
six
silent
sisters
riding
attendance
on
his
bones.

The
funeral
procession
departed
King’s
Landing
through
the
Gate
of
the
Gods,
wider
and
more
splendid
than
the
Lion
Gate.
The
choice
felt
wrong
to
Jaime.
His
father
had
been
a
lion,
that
no
one
could
deny,
but
even
Lord
Tywin
never
claimed
to
be
a
god.

An
honor
guard
of
fifty
knights
surrounded
Lord
Tywin’s
wagon,
crimson
pennons
fluttering
from
their
lances.
The
lords
of
the
west
followed
close
behind
them.
The
winds
snapped
at
their
banners,
making
their
charges
dance
and
flutter.
As
he
trotted
up
the
column,
Jaime
passed
boars,
badgers,
and
beetles,
a
green
arrow
and
a
red
ox,
crossed
halberds,
crossed
spears,
a
treecat,
a
strawberry,
a
maunch,
four
sunbursts
counterchanged.

Lord
Brax
was
wearing
a
pale
grey
doublet
slashed
with
cloth-of-silver,
an
amethyst
unicorn
pinned
above
his
heart.
Lord
Jast
was
armored
in
black
steel,
three
gold
lion’s
heads
inlaid
on
his
breastplate.
The
rumors
of
his
death
had
not
been
far
wrong,
to
look
at
him;
wounds
and
imprisonment
had
left
him
a
shadow
of
the
man
he’d
been.
Lord
Banefort
had
weathered
battle
better,
and
looked
ready
to
return
to
war
at
once.
Plumm
wore
purple,
Prester
ermine,
Moreland
russet
and
green,
but
each
had
donned
a
cloak
of
crimson
silk,
in
honor
of
the
man
they
were
escorting
home.

Behind
the
lords
came
a
hundred
crossbowmen
and
three
hundred
men-at-arms,
and
crimson
flowed
from
their
shoulders
as
well.
In
his
white
cloak
and
white
scale
armor,
Jaime
felt
out
of
place
amongst
that
river
of
red.

Nor
did
his
uncle
make
him
more
at
ease.
“Lord
Commander,”
Ser
Kevan
said,
when
Jaime
trotted
up
beside
him
at
the
head
of
the
column.
“Does
Her
Grace
have
some
last
command
for
me?”

“I
am
not
here
for
Cersei.”
A
drum
began
to
beat
behind
them,
slow,
measured,
funereal.
Dead,
it
seemed
to
say,
dead,
dead.
“I
came
to
make
my
farewells.
He
was
my
father.”

“And
hers.”

“I
am
not
Cersei.
I
have
a
beard,
and
she
has
breasts.
If
you
are
still
confused,
nuncle,
count
our
hands.
Cersei
has
two.”

“Both
of
you
have
a
taste
for
mockery,”
his
uncle
said.
“Spare
me
your
japes,
ser,
I
have
no
taste
for
them.”

“As
you
will.”
This
is
not
going
as
well
as
I
might
have
hoped.
“Cersei
would
have
wanted
to
see
you
off,
but
she
has
many
pressing
duties.”

Ser
Kevan
snorted.
“So
do
we
all.
How
fares
your
king?”
His
tone
made
the
question
a
reproach.

“Well
enough,”
Jaime
said
defensively.
“Balon
Swann
is
with
him
during
the
mornings.
A
good
and
valiant
knight.”

“Once
that
went
without
saying
when
men
spoke
of
those
who
wore
the
white
cloak.”

No
man
can
choose
his
brothers,
Jaime
thought.
Give
me
leave
to
pick
my
own
men,
and
the
Kingsguard
will
be
great
again.
Put
that
baldly,
though,
it
sounded
feeble;
an
empty
boast
from
a
man
the
realm
called
Kingslayer.
A
man
with
shit
for
honor.
Jaime
let
it
go.
He
had
not
come
to
argue
with
his
uncle.
“Ser,”
he
said,
“you
need
to
make
your
peace
with
Cersei.”

“Are
we
at
war?
No
one
told
me.”

Jaime
ignored
that.
“Strife
between
Lannister
and
Lannister
can
only
help
the
enemies
of
our
House.”

“If
there
is
strife,
it
will
not
be
my
doing.
Cersei
wants
to
rule.
Well
and
good.
The
realm
is
hers.
All
I
ask
is
to
be
left
in
peace.
My
place
is
at
Darry
with
my
son.
The
castle
must
needs
be
restored,
the
lands
planted
and
protected.”
He
gave
a
bark
of
bitter
laughter.
“And
your
sister
has
left
me
little
else
to
occupy
my
time.
I
had
as
well
see
Lancel
wed.
His
bride
has
grown
impatient
waiting
for
us
to
make
our
way
to
Darry.”

His
widow
from
the
Twins.
His
cousin
Lancel
was
riding
ten
yards
behind
them.
With
his
hollow
eyes
and
dry
white
hair,
he
looked
older
than
Lord
Jast.
Jaime
could
feel
his
phantom
fingers
itching
at
the
sight
of
him.
...fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...
He
had
tried
to
speak
with
Lancel
more
times
than
he
could
count,
but
never
found
him
alone.
If
his
father
was
not
with
him,
some
septon
was.
He
may
be
Kevan’s
son,
but
he
has
milk
in
his
veins.
Tyrion
was
lying
to
me.
His
words
were
meant
to
wound.

Jaime
put
his
cousin
from
his
thoughts
and
turned
back
to
his
uncle.
“Will
you
remain
at
Darry
after
the
wedding?”

“For
a
while,
mayhaps.
Sandor
Clegane
is
raiding
along
the
Trident,
it
would
seem.
Your
sister
wants
his
head.
It
may
be
that
he
has
joined
Dondarrion.”

Jaime
had
heard
about
Saltpans.
By
now
half
the
realm
had
heard.
The
raid
had
been
exceptionally
savage.
Women
raped
and
mutilated,
children
butchered
in
their
mothers’
arms,
half
the
town
put
to
the
torch.
“Randyll
Tarly
is
at
Maidenpool.
Let
him
deal
with
the
outlaws.
I
would
sooner
have
you
go
to
Riverrun.”

“Ser
Daven
has
command
there.
The
Warden
of
the
West.
He
has
no
need
of
me.
Lancel
does.”

“As
you
say,
uncle.”
Jaime’s
head
was
pounding
to
the
same
beat
as
the
drum.
Dead,
dead,
dead.
“You
would
do
well
to
keep
your
knights
around
you.”

His
uncle
gave
him
a
cool
stare.
“Is
that
a
threat,
ser?”

A
threat?
The
suggestion
took
him
aback.
“A
caution.
I
only
meant...
Sandor
is
dangerous.”

“I
was
hanging
outlaws
and
robber
knights
when
you
were
still
shitting
in
your
swaddling
clothes.
I
am
not
like
to
go
off
and
face
Clegane
and
Dondarrion
by
myself,
if
that
is
what
you
fear,
ser.
Not
every
Lannister
is
a
fool
for
glory.”

Why,
nuncle,
I
believe
you
are
talking
about
me.
“Addam
Marbrand
could
deal
with
these
outlaws
just
as
well
as
you.
So
could
Brax,
Banefort,
Plumm,
any
of
these
others.
But
none
would
make
a
good
King’s
Hand.”

“Your
sister
knows
my
terms.
They
have
not
changed.
Tell
her
that,
the
next
time
you
are
in
her
bedchamber.”
Ser
Kevan
put
his
heels
into
his
courser
and
galloped
ahead,
putting
an
abrupt
end
to
their
conversation.

Jaime
let
him
go,
his
missing
sword
hand
twitching.
He
had
hoped
against
hope
that
Cersei
had
somehow
misunderstood,
but
plainly
that
was
wrong.
He
knows
about
the
two
of
us.
About
Tommen
and
Myrcella.
And
Cersei
knows
he
knows.
Ser
Kevan
was
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock.
He
could
not
believe
that
she
would
ever
do
him
harm,
but...
I
was
wrong
about
Tyrion,
why
not
about
Cersei?
When
sons
were
killing
fathers,
what
was
there
to
stop
a
niece
from
ordering
an
uncle
slain?
An
inconvenient
uncle,
who
knows
too
much.
Though
perhaps
Cersei
was
hoping
that
the
Hound
might
do
her
work
for
her.
If
Sandor
Clegane
cut
down
Ser
Kevan,
she
would
not
need
to
bloody
her
own
hands.
And
he
will,
if
they
should
meet.
Kevan
Lannister
had
once
been
a
stout
man
with
a
sword,
but
he
was
no
longer
young,
and
the
Hound...

The
column
had
caught
up
to
him.
As
his
cousin
rode
past,
flanked
by
his
two
septons,
Jaime
called
out
to
him.
“Lancel.
Coz.
I
wanted
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
marriage.
I
only
regret
that
my
duties
do
not
permit
me
to
attend.”

“His
Grace
must
be
protected.”

“And
will
be.
Still,
I
hate
to
miss
your
bedding.
It
is
your
first
marriage
and
her
second,
I
understand.
I’m
sure
my
lady
will
be
pleased
to
show
you
what
goes
where.”

The
bawdy
remark
drew
a
laugh
from
several
nearby
lords
and
a
disapproving
look
from
Lancel’s
septons.
His
cousin
squirmed
uncomfortably
in
the
saddle.
“I
know
enough
to
do
my
duty
as
a
husband,
ser.”

“That’s
just
the
thing
a
bride
wants
on
her
wedding
night,”
said
Jaime.
“A
husband
who
knows
how
to
do
his
duty.”

A
flush
crept
up
Lancel’s
cheeks.
“I
pray
for
you,
cousin.
And
for
Her
Grace
the
queen.
May
the
Crone
lead
her
to
her
wisdom
and
the
Warrior
defend
her.”

“Why
would
Cersei
need
the
Warrior?
She
has
me.”
Jaime
turned
his
horse
about,
his
white
cloak
snapping
in
the
wind.
The
Imp
was
lying.
Cersei
would
sooner
have
Robert’s
corpse
between
her
legs
than
a
pious
fool
like
Lancel.
Tyrion,
you
evil
bastard,
you
should
have
lied
about
someone
more
likely.
He
galloped
past
his
lord
father’s
funeral
wayn
toward
the
city
in
the
distance.

The
streets
of
King’s
Landing
seemed
almost
deserted
as
Jaime
Lannister
made
his
way
back
to
the
Red
Keep
atop
Aegon’s
High
Hill.
The
soldiers
who
had
crowded
the
city’s
gambling
dens
and
pot
shops
were
largely
gone
now.
Garlan
the
Gallant
had
taken
half
the
Tyrell
strength
back
to
Highgarden,
and
his
lady
mother
and
grandmother
had
gone
with
him.
The
other
half
had
marched
south
with
Mace
Tyrell
and
Mathis
Rowan
to
invest
Storm’s
End.

As
for
the
Lannister
host,
two
thousand
seasoned
veterans
remained
encamped
outside
the
city
walls,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
Paxter
Redwyne’s
fleet
to
carry
them
across
Blackwater
Bay
to
Dragonstone.
Lord
Stannis
appeared
to
have
left
only
a
small
garrison
behind
him
when
he
sailed
north,
so
two
thousand
men
would
be
more
than
sufficient,
Cersei
had
judged.

The
rest
of
the
westermen
had
gone
back
to
their
wives
and
children,
to
rebuild
their
homes,
plant
their
fields,
and
bring
in
one
last
harvest.
Cersei
had
taken
Tommen
round
their
camps
before
they
marched,
to
let
them
cheer
their
little
king.
She
had
never
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
did
that
day,
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
the
autumn
sunlight
shining
on
her
golden
hair.
Whatever
else
one
might
say
about
his
sister,
she
did
know
how
to
make
men
love
her
when
she
cared
enough
to
try.

As
Jaime
trotted
through
the
castle
gates,
he
came
upon
two
dozen
knights
riding
at
a
quintain
in
the
outer
yard.
Something
else
I
can
no
longer
do,
he
thought.
A
lance
was
heavier
and
more
cumbersome
than
a
sword,
and
swords
were
proving
trial
enough.
He
supposed
he
might
try
holding
the
lance
with
his
left
hand,
but
that
would
mean
shifting
his
shield
to
his
right
arm.
In
a
tilt,
a
man’s
foe
was
always
to
the
left.
A
shield
on
his
right
arm
would
prove
about
as
useful
as
nipples
on
his
breastplate.
No,
my
jousting
days
are
done,
he
thought
as
he
dismounted...
but
all
the
same,
he
stopped
to
watch
a
while.

Ser
Tallad
the
Tall
lost
his
mount
when
the
sandbag
came
around
and
thumped
him
in
the
head.
Strongboar
struck
the
shield
so
hard
he
cracked
it.
Kennos
of
Kayce
finished
the
destruction.
A
new
shield
was
hung
for
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood.
Lambert
Turnberry
only
struck
a
glancing
blow,
but
Beardless
Jon
Bettley,
Humfrey
Swyft,
and
Alyn
Stackspear
all
scored
solid
hits,
and
Red
Ronnet
Connington
broke
his
lance
clean.
Then
the
Knight
of
Flowers
mounted
up
and
put
the
others
all
to
shame.

Jousting
was
three-quarters
horsemanship,
Jaime
had
always
believed.
Ser
Loras
rode
superbly,
and
handled
a
lance
as
if
he’d
been
born
holding
one...
which
no
doubt
accounted
for
his
mother’s
pinched
expression.
He
puts
the
point
just
where
he
means
to
put
it,
and
seems
to
have
the
balance
of
a
cat.
Perhaps
it
was
not
such
a
fluke
that
he
unhorsed
me.
It
was
a
shame
that
he
would
never
have
the
chance
to
try
the
boy
again.
He
left
the
whole
men
to
their
sport.

Cersei
was
in
her
solar
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
with
Tommen
and
Lord
Merryweather’s
dark-haired
Myrish
wife.
The
three
of
them
were
laughing
at
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“Did
I
miss
some
clever
jape?”
Jaime
said,
as
he
shoved
through
the
door.

“Oh,
look,”
purred
Lady
Merryweather,
“your
brave
brother
has
returned,
Your
Grace.”

“Most
of
him.”
The
queen
was
in
her
cups,
Jaime
realized.
Of
late,
Cersei
always
seemed
to
have
a
flagon
of
wine
to
hand,
she
who
had
once
scorned
Robert
Baratheon
for
his
drinking.
He
misliked
that,
but
these
days
he
seemed
to
mislike
everything
his
sister
did.
“Grand
Maester,”
she
said,
“share
the
tidings
with
the
Lord
Commander,
if
you
would.”

Pycelle
looked
desperately
uncomfortable.
“There
has
been
a
bird,”
he
said.
“From
Stokeworth.
Lady
Tanda
sends
word
that
her
daughter
Lollys
has
been
delivered
of
a
strong,
healthy
son.”

“And
you
will
never
guess
what
they
have
named
the
little
bastard,
brother.”

“They
wanted
to
name
him
Tywin,
I
recall.”

“Yes,
but
I
forbade
it.
I
told
Falyse
that
I
would
not
have
our
father’s
noble
name
bestowed
upon
the
ill-gotten
spawn
of
some
pig
boy
and
a
feeble-witted
sow.”

“Lady
Stokeworth
insists
the
child’s
name
was
not
her
doing,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
put
in.
Perspiration
dotted
his
wrinkled
forehead.
“Lollys’s
husband
made
the
choice,
she
writes.
This
man
Bronn,
he...
it
would
seem
that
he...”

“Tyrion,”
ventured
Jaime.
“He
named
the
child
Tyrion.”

The
old
man
gave
a
tremulous
nod,
mopping
at
his
brow
with
the
sleeve
of
his
robe.

Jaime
had
to
laugh.
“There
you
are,
sweet
sister.
You
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
Tyrion,
and
all
the
time
he’s
been
hiding
in
Lollys’s
womb.”

“Droll.
You
and
Bronn
are
both
so
droll.
No
doubt
the
bastard
is
sucking
on
one
of
Lollys
Lackwit’s
dugs
even
as
we
speak,
whilst
this
sellsword
looks
on,
smirking
at
his
little
insolence.”

“Perhaps
this
child
bears
some
resemblance
to
your
brother,”
suggested
Lady
Merryweather.
“He
might
have
been
born
deformed,
or
without
a
nose.”
She
laughed
a
throaty
laugh.

“We
shall
have
to
send
the
darling
boy
a
gift,”
the
queen
declared.
“Won’t
we,
Tommen?”

“We
could
send
him
a
kitten.”

“A
lion
cub,”
said
Lady
Merryweather.
To
rip
his
little
throat
out,
her
smile
suggested.

“I
had
a
different
sort
of
gift
in
mind,”
said
Cersei.

A
new
stepfather,
most
like.
Jaime
knew
the
look
in
his
sister’s
eyes.
He
had
seen
it
before,
most
recently
on
the
night
of
Tommen’s
wedding,
when
she
burned
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
The
green
light
of
the
wildfire
had
bathed
the
face
of
the
watchers,
so
they
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
rotting
corpses,
a
pack
of
gleeful
ghouls,
but
some
of
the
corpses
were
prettier
than
others.
Even
in
the
baleful
glow,
Cersei
had
been
beautiful
to
look
upon.
She’d
stood
with
one
hand
on
her
breast,
her
lips
parted,
her
green
eyes
shining.
She
is
crying,
Jaime
had
realized,
but
whether
it
was
from
grief
or
ecstasy
he
could
not
have
said.

The
sight
had
filled
him
with
disquiet,
reminding
him
of
Aerys
Targ-aryen
and
the
way
a
burning
would
arouse
him.
A
king
has
no
secrets
from
his
Kingsguard.
Relations
between
Aerys
and
his
queen
had
been
strained
during
the
last
years
of
his
reign.
They
slept
apart
and
did
their
best
to
avoid
each
other
during
the
waking
hours.
But
whenever
Aerys
gave
a
man
to
the
flames,
Queen
Rhaella
would
have
a
visitor
in
the
night.
The
day
he
burned
his
mace-and-dagger
Hand,
Jaime
and
Jon
Darry
had
stood
at
guard
outside
her
bedchamber
whilst
the
king
took
his
pleasure.
“You’re
hurting
me,”
they
had
heard
Rhaella
cry
through
the
oaken
door.
“You’re
hurting
me.”
In
some
queer
way,
that
had
been
worse
than
Lord
Chelsted’s
screaming.
“We
are
sworn
to
protect
her
as
well,”
Jaime
had
finally
been
driven
to
say.
“We
are,”
Darry
allowed,
“but
not
from
him.”

Jaime
had
only
seen
Rhaella
once
after
that,
the
morning
of
the
day
she
left
for
Dragonstone.
The
queen
had
been
cloaked
and
hooded
as
she
climbed
inside
the
royal
wheelhouse
that
would
take
her
down
Aegon’s
High
Hill
to
the
waiting
ship,
but
he
heard
her
maids
whispering
after
she
was
gone.
They
said
the
queen
looked
as
if
some
beast
had
savaged
her,
clawing
at
her
thighs
and
chewing
on
her
breasts.
A
crowned
beast,
Jaime
knew.

By
the
end
the
Mad
King
had
become
so
fearful
that
he
would
allow
no
blade
in
his
presence,
save
for
the
swords
his
Kingsguard
wore.
His
beard
was
matted
and
unwashed,
his
hair
a
silver-gold
tangle
that
reached
his
waist,
his
fingernails
cracked
yellow
claws
nine
inches
long.
Yet
still
the
blades
tormented
him,
the
ones
he
could
never
escape,
the
blades
of
the
Iron
Throne.
His
arms
and
legs
were
always
covered
with
scabs
and
half-healed
cuts.

Let
him
be
king
over
charred
bones
and
cooked
meat,
Jaime
remembered,
studying
his
sister’s
smile.
Let
him
be
the
king
of
ashes.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said,
“might
we
have
a
private
word?”

“As
you
wish.
Tommen,
it
is
past
time
you
had
your
lesson
for
the
day.
Go
with
the
Grand
Maester.”

“Yes,
Mother.
We
are
learning
about
Baelor
the
Blessed.”

Lady
Merryweather
took
her
leave
as
well,
kissing
the
queen
on
both
cheeks.
“Shall
I
return
for
supper,
Your
Grace?”

“I
shall
be
very
cross
with
you
if
you
do
not.”

Jaime
could
not
help
but
note
the
way
the
Myrish
woman
moved
her
hips
as
she
walked.
Every
step
is
a
seduction.
When
the
door
closed
behind
her,
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said,
“First
these
Kettleblacks,
then
Qyburn,
now
her.
It’s
a
queer
menagerie
you
are
keeping
these
days,
sweet
sister.”

“I
am
growing
very
fond
of
Lady
Taena.
She
amuses
me.”

“She
is
one
of
Margaery
Tyrell’s
companions,”
Jaime
reminded
her.
“She’s
informing
on
you
to
the
little
queen.”

“Of
course
she
is.”
Cersei
went
to
the
sideboard
to
fill
her
cup
anew.
“Margaery
was
thrilled
when
I
asked
her
leave
to
take
Taena
on
as
my
companion.
You
should
have
heard
her.
‘She
will
be
a
sister
to
you,
as
she’s
been
to
me.
Of
course
you
must
have
her!
I
have
my
cousins
and
my
other
ladies.’
Our
little
queen
does
not
want
me
to
be
lonely.”

“If
you
know
she
is
a
spy,
why
take
her
on?”

“Margaery
is
not
half
so
clever
as
she
thinks.
She
has
no
notion
what
a
sweet
serpent
she
has
in
that
Myrish
slut.
I
use
Taena
to
feed
the
little
queen
what
I
want
her
to
know.
Some
of
it
is
even
true.”
Cersei’s
eyes
were
bright
with
mischief.
“And
Taena
tells
me
everything
Maid
Margaery
is
doing.”

“Does
she?
How
much
do
you
know
about
this
woman?”

“I
know
she
is
a
mother,
with
a
young
son
that
she
wants
to
rise
high
in
this
world.
She
will
do
whatever
is
required
to
see
that
he
does.
Mothers
are
all
the
same.
Lady
Merryweather
may
be
a
serpent,
but
she
is
far
from
stupid.
She
knows
I
can
do
more
for
her
than
Margaery,
so
she
makes
herself
useful
to
me.
You
would
be
surprised
at
all
the
interesting
things
she’s
told
me.”

“What
sorts
of
things?”

Cersei
sat
beneath
the
window.
“Did
you
know
that
the
Queen
of
Thorns
keeps
a
chest
of
coins
in
her
wheelhouse?
Old
gold
from
before
the
Conquest.
Should
any
tradesman
be
so
unwise
as
to
name
a
price
in
golden
coins,
she
pays
him
with
hands
from
Highgarden,
each
half
the
weight
of
one
of
our
dragons.
What
merchant
would
dare
complain
of
being
cheated
by
Mace
Tyrell’s
lady
mother?”
She
sipped
her
wine,
and
said,
“Did
you
enjoy
your
little
ride?”

“Our
uncle
remarked
upon
your
absence.”

“Our
uncle’s
remarks
do
not
concern
me.”

“They
should.
You
could
make
good
use
of
him.
If
not
at
Riverrun
or
the
Rock,
then
in
the
north
against
Lord
Stannis.
Father
always
relied
upon
Kevan
when—”

“Roose
Bolton
is
our
Warden
of
the
North.
He
will
deal
with
Stannis.”

“Lord
Bolton
is
trapped
below
the
Neck,
cut
off
from
the
north
by
the
ironmen
at
Moat
Cailin.”

“Not
for
long.
Bolton’s
bastard
son
will
soon
remove
that
little
obstacle.
Lord
Bolton
will
have
two
thousand
Freys
to
augment
his
own
strength,
under
Lord
Walder’s
sons
Hosteen
and
Aenys.
That
should
be
more
than
enough
to
deal
with
Stannis
and
a
few
thousand
broken
men.”

“Ser
Kevan—”

“—will
have
his
hands
full
at
Darry,
teaching
Lancel
how
to
wipe
his
arse.
Father’s
death
has
unmanned
him.
He
is
an
old
done
man.
Daven
and
Damion
will
serve
us
better.”

“They’ll
suffice.”
Jaime
had
no
quarrel
with
his
cousins.
“You
still
require
a
Hand,
however.
If
not
our
uncle,
who?”

His
sister
laughed.
“Not
you.
Have
no
fear
on
that
count.
Perhaps
Taena’s
husband.
His
grandfather
was
Hand
under
Aerys.”

The
horn-of-plenty
Hand.
Jaime
remembered
Owen
Merryweather
well
enough;
an
amiable
man,
but
ineffectual.
“As
I
recall,
he
did
so
well
that
Aerys
exiled
him
and
seized
his
lands.”

“Robert
gave
them
back.
Some,
at
least.
Taena
would
be
pleased
if
Orton
could
recover
the
rest.”

“Is
this
about
pleasing
some
Myrish
whore?
Here
I
thought
it
was
about
governing
the
realm.”

“I
govern
the
realm.”

Seven
save
us
all,
you
do.
His
sister
liked
to
think
of
herself
as
Lord
Tywin
with
teats,
but
she
was
wrong.
Their
father
had
been
as
relentless
and
implacable
as
a
glacier,
where
Cersei
was
all
wildfire,
especially
when
thwarted.
She
had
been
giddy
as
a
maiden
when
she
learned
that
Stannis
had
abandoned
Dragonstone,
certain
that
he
had
finally
given
up
the
fight
and
sailed
away
to
exile.
When
word
came
down
from
the
north
that
he
had
turned
up
again
at
the
Wall,
her
fury
had
been
fearful
to
behold.
She
does
not
lack
for
wits,
but
she
has
no
judgment,
and
no
patience.
“You
need
a
strong
Hand
to
help
you.”

“A
weak
ruler
needs
a
strong
Hand,
as
Aerys
needed
Father.
A
strong
ruler
requires
only
a
diligent
servant
to
carry
out
his
orders.”
She
swirled
her
wine.
“Lord
Hallyne
might
suit.
He
would
not
be
the
first
pyromancer
to
serve
as
the
King’s
Hand.”

No.
I
killed
the
last
one.
“There
is
talk
that
you
mean
to
make
Aurane
Waters
the
master
of
ships.”

“Has
someone
been
informing
on
me?”
When
he
did
not
answer,
Cersei
tossed
her
hair
back,
and
said,
“Waters
is
well
suited
to
the
office.
He
has
spent
half
his
life
on
ships.”

“Half
his
life?
He
cannot
be
more
than
twenty.”

“Two-and-twenty,
and
what
of
it?
Father
was
not
even
one-and-twenty
when
Aerys
Targaryen
named
him
Hand.
It
is
past
time
Tommen
had
some
young
men
about
him
in
place
of
all
these
wrinkled
greybeards.
Aurane
is
strong
and
vigorous.”

Strong
and
vigorous
and
handsome,
Jaime
thought.
...she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...
“Paxter
Redwyne
would
be
a
better
choice.
He
commands
the
largest
fleet
in
Westeros.
Aurane
Waters
could
command
a
skiff,
but
only
if
you
bought
him
one.”

“You
are
a
child,
Jaime.
Redwyne
is
Tyrell’s
bannerman,
and
nephew
to
that
hideous
grandmother
of
his.
I
want
none
of
Lord
Tyrell’s
creatures
on
my
council.”

“Tommen’s
council,
you
mean.”

“You
know
what
I
mean.”

Too
well.
“I
know
that
Aurane
Waters
is
a
bad
idea,
and
Hallyne
is
a
worse
one.
As
for
Qyburn...
gods
be
good,
Cersei,
he
rode
with
Vargo
Hoat.
The
Citadel
stripped
him
of
his
chain!”

“The
grey
sheep.
Qyburn
has
made
himself
most
useful
to
me.
And
he
is
loyal,
which
is
more
than
I
can
say
of
mine
own
kin.”

The
crows
will
feast
upon
us
all
if
you
go
on
this
way,
sweet
sister.
“Cersei,
listen
to
yourself.
You
are
seeing
dwarfs
in
every
shadow
and
making
foes
of
friends.
Uncle
Kevan
is
not
your
enemy.
I
am
not
your
enemy.”

Her
face
twisted
in
fury.
“I
begged
you
for
your
help.
I
went
down
on
my
knees
to
you,
and
you
refused
me!”

“My
vows...”

“...did
not
stop
you
slaying
Aerys.
Words
are
wind.
You
could
have
had
me,
but
you
chose
a
cloak
instead.
Get
out.”

“Sister...”

“Get
out,
I
said.
I
am
sick
of
looking
at
that
ugly
stump
of
yours.
Get
out!”
To
speed
him
on
his
way,
she
heaved
her
wine
cup
at
his
head.
She
missed,
but
Jaime
took
the
hint.

Evenfall
found
him
sitting
alone
in
the
common
room
of
White
Sword
Tower,
with
a
cup
of
Dornish
red
and
the
White
Book.
He
was
turning
pages
with
the
stump
of
his
sword
hand
when
the
Knight
of
Flowers
entered,
removed
his
cloak
and
swordbelt
and
hung
them
on
a
wall
peg
next
to
Jaime’s.

“I
saw
you
in
the
yard
today,”
said
Jaime.
“You
rode
well.”

“Better
than
well,
surely.”
Ser
Loras
poured
himself
a
cup
of
wine,
and
took
a
seat
across
the
half-moon
table.

“A
more
modest
man
might
have
answered
‘My
lord
is
too
kind,’
or
‘I
had
a
good
mount.’”

“The
horse
was
adequate,
and
my
lord
is
as
kind
as
I
am
modest.”
Loras
waved
at
the
book.
“Lord
Renly
always
said
that
books
were
for
maesters.”

“This
one
is
for
us.
The
history
of
every
man
who
has
ever
worn
a
white
cloak
is
written
here.”

“I
have
glanced
at
it.
The
shields
are
pretty.
I
prefer
books
with
more
illuminations.
Lord
Renly
owned
a
few
with
drawings
that
would
turn
a
septon
blind.”

Jaime
had
to
smile.
“There’s
none
of
that
here,
ser,
but
the
histories
will
open
your
eyes.
You
would
do
well
to
know
about
the
lives
of
those
who
went
before.”

“I
do.
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
Ser
Ryam
Redwyne,
the
Greatheart,
Barristan
the
Bold...”

“...Gwayne
Corbray,
Alyn
Connington,
the
Demon
of
Darry,
aye.
You
will
have
heard
of
Lucamore
Strong
as
well.”

“Ser
Lucamore
the
Lusty?”
Ser
Loras
seemed
amused.
“Three
wives
and
thirty
children,
was
it?
They
cut
his
cock
off.
Shall
I
sing
the
song
for
you,
my
lord?”

“And
Ser
Terrence
Toyne?”

“Bedded
the
king’s
mistress
and
died
screaming.
The
lesson
is,
men
who
wear
white
breeches
need
to
keep
them
tightly
laced.”

“Gyles
Greycloak?
Orivel
the
Open-Handed?”

“Gyles
was
a
traitor,
Orivel
a
coward.
Men
who
shamed
the
white
cloak.
What
is
my
lord
suggesting?”

“Little
and
less.
Don’t
take
offense
where
none
was
meant,
ser.
How
about
Long
Tom
Costayne?”

Ser
Loras
shook
his
head.

“He
was
a
Kingsguard
knight
for
sixty
years.”

“When
was
that?
I’ve
never—”

“Ser
Donnel
of
Duskendale,
then?”

“I
may
have
heard
the
name,
but—”

“Addison
Hill?
The
White
Owl,
Michael
Mertyns?
Jeffory
Norcross?
They
called
him
Neveryield.
Red
Robert
Flowers?
What
can
you
tell
me
of
them?”

“Flowers
is
a
bastard
name.
So
is
Hill.”

“Yet
both
men
rose
to
command
the
Kingsguard.
Their
tales
are
in
the
book.
Rolland
Darklyn
is
in
here
too.
The
youngest
man
ever
to
serve
in
the
Kingsguard,
until
me.
He
was
given
his
cloak
on
a
battlefield
and
died
within
an
hour
of
donning
it.”

“He
can’t
have
been
very
good.”

“Good
enough.
He
died,
but
his
king
lived.
A
lot
of
brave
men
have
worn
the
white
cloak.
Most
have
been
forgotten.”

“Most
deserve
to
be
forgotten.
The
heroes
will
always
be
remembered.
The
best.”

“The
best
and
the
worst.”
So
one
of
us
is
like
to
live
in
song.
“And
a
few
who
were
a
bit
of
both.
Like
him.”
He
tapped
the
page
he
had
been
reading.

“Who?”
Ser
Loras
craned
his
head
around
to
see.
“Ten
black
pellets
on
a
scarlet
field.
I
do
not
know
those
arms.”

“They
belonged
to
Criston
Cole,
who
served
the
first
Viserys
and
the
second
Aegon.”
Jaime
closed
the
White
Book.
“They
called
him
Kingmaker.”





CERSEI

Three
wretched
fools
with
a
leather
sack,
the
queen
thought
as
they
sank
to
their
knees
before
her.
The
look
of
them
did
not
encourage
her.
I
suppose
there
is
always
a
chance.

“Your
Grace,”
said
Qyburn
quietly,
“the
small
council...”

“...will
await
my
pleasure.
It
may
be
that
we
can
bring
them
word
of
a
traitor’s
death.”
Off
across
the
city,
the
bells
of
Baelor’s
Sept
sang
their
song
of
mourning.
No
bells
will
ring
for
you,
Tyrion,
Cersei
thought.
I
shall
dip
your
head
in
tar
and
give
your
twisted
body
to
the
dogs.
“Off
your
knees,”
she
told
the
would-be
lords.
“Show
me
what
you’ve
brought
me.”

They
rose;
three
ugly
men,
and
ragged.
One
had
a
boil
on
his
neck,
and
none
had
washed
in
half
a
year.
The
prospect
of
raising
such
to
lordship
amused
her.
I
could
seat
them
next
to
Margaery
at
feasts.
When
the
chief
fool
undid
the
drawstring
on
the
sack
and
plunged
his
hand
inside,
the
smell
of
decay
filled
her
audience
chamber
like
some
rank
rose.
The
head
he
pulled
out
was
grey-green
and
crawling
with
maggots.
It
smells
like
Father.
Dorcas
gasped,
and
Jocelyn
covered
her
mouth
and
retched.

The
queen
considered
her
prize,
unflinching.
“You’ve
killed
the
wrong
dwarf,”
she
said
at
last,
grudging
every
word.

“We
never
did,”
one
of
the
fools
dared
to
say.
“This
is
got
to
be
him,
ser.
A
dwarf,
see.
He’s
rotted
some,
is
all.”

“He
has
also
grown
a
new
nose,”
Cersei
observed.
“A
rather
bulbous
one,
I’d
say.
Tyrion’s
nose
was
hacked
off
in
a
battle.”

The
three
fools
exchanged
a
look.
“No
one
told
us,”
said
the
one
with
head
in
hand.
“This
one
come
walking
along
as
bold
as
you
please,
some
ugly
dwarf,
so
we
thought...”

“He
said
he
were
a
sparrow,”
the
one
with
the
boil
added,
“and
you
said
he
was
lying.”
That
was
directed
at
the
third
man.

The
queen
was
angry
to
think
that
she
had
kept
her
small
council
waiting
for
this
mummer’s
farce.
“You
have
wasted
my
time
and
slain
an
innocent
man.
I
should
have
your
own
heads
off.”
But
if
she
did,
the
next
man
might
hesitate
and
let
the
Imp
slip
the
net.
She
would
pile
dead
dwarfs
ten
feet
high
before
she
let
that
happen.
“Remove
yourselves
from
my
sight.”

“Aye,
Your
Grace,”
said
the
boil.
“We
beg
your
pardons.”

“Do
you
want
the
head?”
asked
the
man
who
held
it.

“Give
it
to
Ser
Meryn.
No,
in
the
sack,
you
lackwit.
Yes.
Ser
Osmund,
see
them
out.”

Trant
removed
the
head
and
Kettleblack
the
headsmen,
leaving
only
Lady
Jocelyn’s
breakfast
as
evidence
of
their
visit.
“Clean
that
up
at
once,”
the
queen
commanded
her.
This
was
the
third
head
that
had
been
delivered
to
her.
At
least
this
one
was
a
dwarf.
The
last
had
simply
been
an
ugly
child.

“Someone
will
find
the
dwarf,
never
fear,”
Ser
Osmund
assured
her.
“And
when
they
do,
we’ll
kill
him
good.”

Will
you?
Last
night
Cersei
had
dreamed
of
the
old
woman,
with
her
pebbly
jowls
and
croaking
voice.
Maggy
the
Frog,
they
had
called
her
in
Lannisport.
If
Father
had
known
what
she
said
to
me,
he
would
have
had
her
tongue
out.
Cersei
had
never
told
anyone,
though,
not
even
Jaime.
Melara
said
that
if
we
never
spoke
about
her
prophecies,
we
would
forget
them.
She
said
that
a
forgotten
prophecy
couldn’t
come
true.

“I
have
informers
sniffing
after
the
Imp
everywhere,
Your
Grace,”
said
Qyburn.
He
had
garbed
himself
in
something
very
like
maester’s
robes,
but
white
instead
of
grey,
immaculate
as
the
cloaks
of
the
Kingsguard.
Whorls
of
gold
decorated
his
hem,
sleeves,
and
stiff
high
collar,
and
a
golden
sash
was
tied
about
his
waist.
“Oldtown,
Gulltown,
Dorne,
even
the
Free
Cities.
Wheresoever
he
might
run,
my
whisperers
will
find
him.”

“You
assume
he
left
King’s
Landing.
He
could
be
hiding
in
Baelor’s
Sept
for
all
we
know,
swinging
on
the
bell
ropes
to
make
that
awful
din.”
Cersei
made
a
sour
face
and
let
Dorcas
help
her
to
her
feet.
“Come,
my
lord.
My
council
awaits.”
She
took
Qyburn
by
the
arm
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
stairs.
“Have
you
attended
to
that
little
task
I
set
you?”

“I
have,
Your
Grace.
I
am
sorry
that
it
took
so
long.
Such
a
large
head.
It
took
the
beetles
many
hours
to
clean
the
flesh.
By
way
of
pardon,
I
have
lined
a
box
of
ebony
and
silver
with
felt,
to
make
a
fitting
presentation
for
the
skull.”

“A
cloth
sack
would
serve
as
well.
Prince
Doran
wants
his
head.
He
won’t
give
a
fig
what
sort
of
box
it
comes
in.”

The
pealing
of
the
bells
was
louder
in
the
yard.
He
was
only
a
High
Septon.
How
long
must
we
endure
this?
The
ringing
was
more
melodious
than
the
Mountain’s
screams
had
been,
but...

Qyburn
seemed
to
sense
what
she
was
thinking.
“The
bells
will
stop
at
sunset,
Your
Grace.”

“That
will
be
a
great
relief.
How
can
you
know?”

“Knowing
is
the
nature
of
my
service.”

Varys
had
all
of
us
believing
he
was
irreplaceable.
What
fools
we
were.
Once
the
queen
let
it
become
known
that
Qyburn
had
taken
the
eunuch’s
place,
the
usual
vermin
had
wasted
no
time
in
making
themselves
known
to
him,
to
trade
their
whispers
for
a
few
coins.
It
was
the
silver
all
along,
not
the
Spider.
Qyburn
will
serve
us
just
as
well.
She
was
looking
forward
to
the
look
on
Pycelle’s
face
when
Qyburn
took
his
seat.

A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
was
always
posted
outside
the
doors
of
the
council
chambers
when
the
small
council
was
in
session.
Today
it
was
Ser
Boros
Blount.
“Ser
Boros,”
the
queen
said
pleasantly,
“you
look
quite
grey
this
morning.
Something
you
ate,
perchance?”
Jaime
had
made
him
the
king’s
food
taster.
A
tasty
task,
but
shameful
for
a
knight.
Blount
hated
it.
His
sagging
jowls
quivered
as
he
held
the
door
for
them.

The
councillors
quieted
as
she
entered.
Lord
Gyles
coughed
by
way
of
greeting,
loud
enough
to
wake
Pycelle.
The
others
rose,
mouthing
pleasantries.
Cersei
allowed
herself
the
faintest
of
smiles.
“My
lords,
I
know
you
will
forgive
my
lateness.”

“We
are
here
to
serve
Your
Grace,”
said
Ser
Harys
Swyft.
“It
is
our
pleasure
to
anticipate
your
coming.”

“You
all
know
Lord
Qyburn,
I
am
sure.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
did
not
disappoint
her.
“Lord
Qyburn?”
he
managed,
purpling.
“Your
Grace,
this...
a
maester
swears
sacred
vows,
to
hold
no
lands
or
lordships...”

“Your
Citadel
took
away
his
chain,”
Cersei
reminded
him.
“If
he
is
not
a
maester,
he
cannot
be
held
to
a
maester’s
vows.
We
called
the
eunuch
lord
as
well,
you
may
recall.”

Pycelle
sputtered.
“This
man
is...
he
is
unfit...”

“Do
not
presume
to
speak
to
me
of
fitness.
Not
after
the
stinking
mockery
you
made
of
my
lord
father’s
corpse.”

“Your
Grace
cannot
think...”
He
raised
a
spotted
hand,
as
if
to
ward
off
a
blow.
“The
silent
sisters
removed
Lord
Tywin’s
bowels
and
organs,
drained
his
blood...
every
care
was
taken...
his
body
was
stuffed
with
salts
and
fragrant
herbs...”

“Oh,
spare
me
the
disgusting
details.
I
smelled
the
results
of
your
care.
Lord
Qyburn’s
healing
arts
saved
my
brother’s
life,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
will
serve
the
king
more
ably
than
that
simpering
eunuch.
My
lord,
you
know
your
fellow
councillors?”

“I
would
be
a
poor
informer
if
I
did
not,
Your
Grace.”
Qyburn
seated
himself
between
Orton
Merryweather
and
Gyles
Rosby.

My
councillors.
Cersei
had
uprooted
every
rose,
and
all
those
beholden
to
her
uncle
and
her
brothers.
In
their
places
were
men
whose
loyalty
would
be
to
her.
She
had
even
given
them
new
styles,
borrowed
from
the
Free
Cities;
the
queen
would
have
no
“masters”
at
court
beside
herself.
Orton
Merryweather
was
her
justiciar,
Gyles
Rosby
her
lord
treasurer.
Aurane
Waters,
the
dashing
young
Bastard
of
Driftmark,
would
be
her
grand
admiral.

And
for
her
Hand,
Ser
Harys
Swyft.

Soft,
bald,
and
obsequious,
Swyft
had
an
absurd
little
white
puff
of
beard
where
most
men
had
a
chin.
The
blue
bantam
rooster
of
his
House
was
worked
across
the
front
of
his
plush
yellow
doublet
in
beads
of
lapis.
Over
that
he
wore
a
mantle
of
blue
velvet
decorated
with
a
hundred
golden
hands.
Ser
Harys
had
been
thrilled
by
his
appointment,
too
dim
to
realize
that
he
was
more
hostage
than
Hand.
His
daughter
was
her
uncle’s
wife,
and
Kevan
loved
his
chinless
lady,
flat-chested
and
chicken-legged
as
she
was.
So
long
as
she
had
Ser
Harys
in
hand,
Kevan
Lannister
must
needs
think
twice
about
opposing
her.
To
be
sure,
a
good-father
is
not
the
ideal
hostage,
but
better
a
flimsy
shield
than
none.

“Will
the
king
be
joining
us?”
asked
Orton
Merryweather.

“My
son
is
playing
with
his
little
queen.
For
the
moment,
his
idea
of
kingship
is
stamping
papers
with
the
royal
seal.
His
Grace
is
still
too
young
to
comprehend
affairs
of
state.”

“And
our
valiant
Lord
Commander?”

“Ser
Jaime
is
at
his
armorer’s
being
fitted
for
a
hand.
I
know
we
were
all
tired
of
that
ugly
stump.
And
I
daresay
he
would
find
these
proceedings
as
tiresome
as
Tommen.”
Aurane
Waters
chuckled
at
that.
Good,
Cersei
thought,
the
more
they
laugh,
the
less
he
is
a
threat.
Let
them
laugh.
“Do
we
have
wine?”

“We
do,
Your
Grace.”
Orton
Merryweather
was
not
a
comely
man,
with
his
big
lumpish
nose
and
shock
of
unruly
reddish-orange
hair,
but
he
was
never
less
than
courteous.
“We
have
Dornish
red
and
Arbor
gold,
and
a
fine
sweet
hippocras
from
Highgarden.”

“The
gold,
I
think.
I
find
Dornish
wines
as
sour
as
the
Dornish.”
As
Merryweather
filled
her
cup,
Cersei
said,
“I
suppose
we
had
as
well
begin
with
them.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle’s
lips
were
still
quivering,
yet
somehow
he
found
his
tongue.
“As
you
command.
Prince
Doran
has
taken
his
brother’s
unruly
bastards
into
custody,
yet
Sunspear
still
seethes.
The
prince
writes
that
he
cannot
hope
to
calm
the
waters
until
he
receives
the
justice
that
was
promised
him.”

“To
be
sure.”
A
tiresome
creature,
this
prince.
“His
long
wait
is
almost
done.
I
am
sending
Balon
Swann
to
Sunspear,
to
deliver
him
the
head
of
Gregor
Clegane.”
Ser
Balon
would
have
another
task
as
well,
but
that
part
was
best
left
unsaid.

“Ah.”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
fumbled
at
his
funny
little
beard
with
thumb
and
forefinger.
“He
is
dead
then?
Ser
Gregor?”

“I
would
think
so,
my
lord,”
Aurane
Waters
said
dryly.
“I
am
told
that
removing
the
head
from
the
body
is
often
mortal.”

Cersei
favored
him
with
a
smile;
she
liked
a
bit
of
wit,
so
long
as
she
was
not
its
target.
“Ser
Gregor
perished
of
his
wounds,
just
as
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
foretold.”

Pycelle
harrumphed
and
eyed
Qyburn
sourly.
“The
spear
was
poisoned.
No
man
could
have
saved
him.”

“So
you
said.
I
recall
it
well.”
The
queen
turned
to
her
Hand.
“What
were
you
speaking
of
when
I
arrived,
Ser
Harys?”

“Sparrows,
Your
Grace.
Septon
Raynard
says
there
may
be
as
many
as
two
thousand
in
the
city,
and
more
arriving
every
day.
Their
leaders
preach
of
doom
and
demon
worship...”

Cersei
took
a
taste
of
wine.
Very
nice.
“And
long
past
time,
wouldn’t
you
agree?
What
would
you
call
this
red
god
that
Stannis
worships,
if
not
a
demon?
The
Faith
should
oppose
such
evil.”
Qyburn
had
reminded
her
of
that,
the
clever
man.
“Our
late
High
Septon
let
too
much
pass,
I
fear.
Age
had
dimmed
his
sight
and
sapped
his
strength.”

“He
was
an
old
done
man,
Your
Grace.”
Qyburn
smiled
at
Pycelle.
“His
passing
should
not
have
surprised
us.
No
man
can
ask
for
more
than
to
die
peacefully
in
his
sleep,
full
of
years.”

“No,”
said
Cersei,
“but
we
must
hope
that
his
successor
is
more
vigorous.
My
friends
upon
the
other
hill
tell
me
that
it
will
most
like
be
Torbert
or
Raynard.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat.
“I
have
friends
among
the
Most
Devout
as
well,
and
they
speak
of
Septon
Ollidor.”

“Do
not
discount
this
man
Luceon,”
Qyburn
said.
“Last
night
he
feted
thirty
of
the
Most
Devout
on
suckling
pig
and
Arbor
gold,
and
by
day
he
hands
out
hardbread
to
the
poor
to
prove
his
piety.”

Aurane
Waters
seemed
as
bored
as
Cersei
by
all
this
prattle
about
septons.
Seen
up
close,
his
hair
was
more
silvery
than
gold,
and
his
eyes
were
grey-green
where
Prince
Rhaegar’s
had
been
purple.
Even
so,
the
resemblance...
She
wondered
if
Waters
would
shave
his
beard
for
her.
Though
he
was
ten
years
her
junior,
he
wanted
her;
Cersei
could
see
it
in
the
way
he
looked
at
her.
Men
had
been
looking
at
her
that
way
since
her
breasts
began
to
bud.
Because
I
was
so
beautiful,
they
said,
but
Jaime
was
beautiful
as
well,
and
they
never
looked
at
him
that
way.
When
she
was
small
she
would
sometimes
don
her
brother’s
clothing
as
a
lark.
She
was
always
startled
by
how
differently
men
treated
her
when
they
thought
that
she
was
Jaime.
Even
Lord
Tywin
himself...

Pycelle
and
Merryweather
were
still
quibbling
about
who
the
new
High
Septon
was
like
to
be.
“One
will
serve
as
well
as
another,”
the
queen
announced
abruptly,
“but
whosoever
dons
the
crystal
crown
must
pronounce
an
anathema
upon
the
Imp.”
This
last
High
Septon
had
been
conspicuously
silent
regarding
Tyrion.
“As
for
these
pink
sparrows,
so
long
as
they
preach
no
treason
they
are
the
Faith’s
problem,
not
ours.”

Lord
Orton
and
Ser
Harys
murmured
agreement.
Gyles
Rosby’s
attempt
to
do
the
same
dissolved
into
a
fit
of
coughing.
Cersei
turned
away
in
distaste
as
he
was
hacking
up
a
gob
of
bloody
phlegm.
“Maester,
have
you
brought
the
letter
from
the
Vale?”

“I
have,
Your
Grace.”
Pycelle
plucked
it
from
his
pile
of
papers
and
smoothed
it
out.
“It
is
a
declaration,
rather
than
a
letter.
Signed
at
Runestone
by
Bronze
Yohn
Royce,
Lady
Waynwood,
Lords
Hunter,
Redfort,
and
Belmore,
and
Symond
Templeton,
the
Knight
of
Ninestars.
All
have
affixed
their
seals.
They
write—”

A
deal
of
rubbish.
“My
lords
may
read
the
letter
if
they
wish.
Royce
and
these
others
are
massing
men
below
the
Eyrie.
They
mean
to
remove
Littlefinger
as
Lord
Protector
of
the
Vale,
forcibly
if
need
be.
The
question
is,
ought
we
allow
this?”

“Does
Lord
Baelish
seek
our
help?”
asked
Harys
Swyft.

“Not
as
yet.
In
truth,
he
seems
quite
unconcerned.
His
last
letter
mentions
the
rebels
only
briefly
before
beseeching
me
to
ship
him
some
old
tapestries
of
Robert’s.”

Ser
Harys
fingered
his
chin
beard.
“And
these
lords
of
the
declaration,
do
they
appeal
to
the
king
to
take
a
hand?”

“They
do
not.”

“Then...
mayhaps
we
need
do
nothing.”

“A
war
in
the
Vale
would
be
most
tragic,”
said
Pycelle.

“War?”
Orton
Merryweather
laughed.
“Lord
Baelish
is
a
most
amusing
man,
but
one
does
not
fight
a
war
with
witticisms.
I
doubt
there
will
be
bloodshed.
And
does
it
matter
who
is
regent
for
little
Lord
Robert,
so
long
as
the
Vale
remits
its
taxes?”

No,
Cersei
decided.
=======
say.
“We’ll
find
a
horse
for
you,
I
promise,”
Robb
whispered
at
last.

“Are
they
ever
coming
back?”
Bran
asked
him.

“Yes,”
Robb
said
with
such
hope
in
his
voice
that
Bran
knew
he
was
hearing
his
brother
and
not
just
Robb
the
Lord.
“Mother
will
be
home
soon.
Maybe
we
can
ride
out
to
meet
her
when
she
comes.
Wouldn’t
that
surprise
her,
to
see
you
ahorse?”
Even
in
the
dark
room,
Bran
could
feel
his
brother’s
smile.
“And
afterward,
we’ll
ride
north
to
see
the
Wall.
We
won’t
even
tell
Jon
we’re
coming,
we’ll
just
be
there
one
day,
you
and
me.
It
will
be
an
adventure.”

“An
adventure,”
Bran
repeated
wistfully.
He
heard
his
brother
sob.
The
room
was
so
dark
he
could
not
see
the
tears
on
Robb’s
face,
so
he
reached
out
and
found
his
hand.
Their
fingers
twined
together.





EDDARD

“Lord
Arryn’s
death
was
a
great
sadness
for
all
of
us,
my
lord,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“I
would
be
more
than
happy
to
tell
you
what
I
can
of
the
manner
of
his
passing.
Do
be
seated.
Would
you
care
for
refreshments?
Some
dates,
perhaps?
I
have
some
very
fine
persimmons
as
well.
Wine
no
longer
agrees
with
my
digestion,
I
fear,
but
I
can
offer
you
a
cup
of
iced
milk,
sweetened
with
honey.
I
find
it
most
refreshing
in
this
heat.”

There
was
no
denying
the
heat;
Ned
could
feel
the
silk
tunic
clinging
to
his
chest.
Thick,
moist
air
covered
the
city
like
a
damp
woolen
blanket,
and
the
riverside
had
grown
unruly
as
the
poor
fled
their
hot,
airless
warrens
to
jostle
for
sleeping
places
near
the
water,
where
the
only
breath
of
wind
was
to
be
found.
“That
would
be
most
kind,”
Ned
said,
seating
himself.

Pycelle
lifted
a
tiny
silver
bell
with
thumb
and
forefinger
and
tinkled
it
gently.
A
slender
young
serving
girl
hurried
into
the
solar.
“Iced
milk
for
the
King’s
Hand
and
myself,
if
you
would
be
so
kind,
child.
Well
sweetened.”

As
the
girl
went
to
fetch
their
drinks,
the
Grand
Maester
knotted
his
fingers
together
and
rested
his
hands
on
his
stomach.
“The
smallfolk
say
that
the
last
year
of
summer
is
always
the
hottest.
It
is
not
so,
yet
ofttimes
it
feels
that
way,
does
it
not?
On
days
like
this,
I
envy
you
northerners
your
summer
snows.”
The
heavy
jeweled
chain
around
the
old
man’s
neck
chinked
softly
as
he
shifted
in
his
seat.
“To
be
sure,
King
Maekar’s
summer
was
hotter
than
this
one,
and
near
as
long.
There
were
fools,
even
in
the
Citadel,
who
took
that
to
mean
that
the
Great
Summer
had
come
at
last,
the
summer
that
never
ends,
but
in
the
seventh
year
it
broke
suddenly,
and
we
had
a
short
autumn
and
a
terrible
long
winter.
Still,
the
heat
was
fierce
while
it
lasted.
Oldtown
steamed
and
sweltered
by
day
and
came
alive
only
by
night.
We
would
walk
in
the
gardens
by
the
river
and
argue
about
the
gods.
I
remember
the
smells
of
those
nights,
my
lord—perfume
and
sweat,
melons
ripe
to
bursting,
peaches
and
pomegranates,
nightshade
and
moonbloom.
I
was
a
young
man
then,
still
forging
my
chain.
The
heat
did
not
exhaust
me
as
it
does
now.”
Pycelle’s
eyes
were
so
heavily
lidded
he
looked
half-asleep.
“My
pardons,
Lord
Eddard.
You
did
not
come
to
hear
foolish
meanderings
of
a
summer
forgotten
before
your
father
was
born.
Forgive
an
old
man
his
wanderings,
if
you
would.
Minds
are
like
swords,
I
do
fear.
The
old
ones
go
to
rust.
Ah,
and
here
is
our
milk.”
The
serving
girl
placed
the
tray
between
them,
and
Pycelle
gave
her
a
smile.
“Sweet
child.”
He
lifted
a
cup,
tasted,
nodded.
“Thank
you.
You
may
go.”

When
the
girl
had
taken
her
leave,
Pycelle
peered
at
Ned
through
pale,
rheumy
eyes.
“Now
where
were
we?
Oh,
yes.
You
asked
about
Lord
Arryn…”

“I
did.”
Ned
sipped
politely
at
the
iced
milk.
It
was
pleasantly
cold,
but
oversweet
to
his
taste.

“If
truth
be
told,
the
Hand
had
not
seemed
quite
himself
for
some
time,”
Pycelle
said.
“We
had
sat
together
on
council
many
a
year,
he
and
I,
and
the
signs
were
there
to
read,
but
I
put
them
down
to
the
great
burdens
he
had
borne
so
faithfully
for
so
long.
Those
broad
shoulders
were
weighed
down
by
all
the
cares
of
the
realm,
and
more
besides.
His
son
was
ever
sickly,
and
his
lady
wife
so
anxious
that
she
would
scarcely
let
the
boy
out
of
her
sight.
It
was
enough
to
weary
even
a
strong
man,
and
the
Lord
Jon
was
not
young.
Small
wonder
if
he
seemed
melancholy
and
tired.
Or
so
I
thought
at
the
time.
Yet
now
I
am
less
certain.”
He
gave
a
ponderous
shake
of
his
head.

“What
can
you
tell
me
of
his
final
illness?”

The
Grand
Maester
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
helpless
sorrow.
“He
came
to
me
one
day
asking
after
a
certain
book,
as
hale
and
healthy
as
ever,
though
it
did
seem
to
me
that
something
was
troubling
him
deeply.
The
next
morning
he
was
twisted
over
in
pain,
too
sick
to
rise
from
bed.
Maester
Colemon
thought
it
was
a
chill
on
the
stomach.
The
weather
had
been
hot,
and
the
Hand
often
iced
his
wine,
which
can
upset
the
digestion.
When
Lord
Jon
continued
to
weaken,
I
went
to
him
myself,
but
the
gods
did
not
grant
me
the
power
to
save
him.”

“I
have
heard
that
you
sent
Maester
Colemon
away.”

The
Grand
Maester’s
nod
was
as
slow
and
deliberate
as
a
glacier.
“I
did,
and
I
fear
the
Lady
Lysa
will
never
forgive
me
that.
Maybe
I
was
wrong,
but
at
the
time
I
thought
it
best.
Maester
Colemon
is
like
a
son
to
me,
and
I
yield
to
none
in
my
esteem
for
his
abilities,
but
he
is
young,
and
the
young
ofttimes
do
not
comprehend
the
frailty
of
an
older
body.
He
was
purging
Lord
Arryn
with
wasting
potions
and
pepper
juice,
and
I
feared
he
might
kill
him.”

“Did
Lord
Arryn
say
anything
to
you
during
his
final
hours?”

Pycelle
wrinkled
his
brow.
“In
the
last
stage
of
his
fever,
the
Hand
called
out
the
name
Robert
several
times,
but
whether
he
was
asking
for
his
son
or
for
the
king
I
could
not
say.
Lady
Lysa
would
not
permit
the
boy
to
enter
the
sickroom,
for
fear
that
he
too
might
be
taken
ill.
The
king
did
come,
and
he
sat
beside
the
bed
for
hours,
talking
and
joking
of
times
long
past
in
hopes
of
raising
Lord
Jon’s
spirits.
His
love
was
fierce
to
see.”

“Was
there
nothing
else?
No
final
words?”

“When
I
saw
that
all
hope
had
fled,
I
gave
the
Hand
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
so
he
should
not
suffer.
Just
before
he
closed
his
eyes
for
the
last
time,
he
whispered
something
to
the
king
and
his
lady
wife,
a
blessing
for
his
son.
The
seed
is
strong,
he
said.
At
the
end,
his
speech
was
too
slurred
to
comprehend.
Death
did
not
come
until
the
next
morning,
but
Lord
Jon
was
at
peace
after
that.
He
never
spoke
again.”

Ned
took
another
swallow
of
milk,
trying
not
to
gag
on
the
sweetness
of
it.
“Did
it
seem
to
you
that
there
was
anything
unnatural
about
Lord
Arryn’s
death?”

“Unnatural?”
The
aged
maester’s
voice
was
thin
as
a
whisper.
“No,
I
could
not
say
so.
Sad,
for
a
certainty.
Yet
in
its
own
way,
death
is
the
most
natural
thing
of
all,
Lord
Eddard.
Jon
Arryn
rests
easy
now,
his
burdens
lifted
at
last.”

“This
illness
that
took
him,”
said
Ned.
“Had
you
ever
seen
its
like
before,
in
other
men?”

“Near
forty
years
I
have
been
Grand
Maester
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Pycelle
replied.
“Under
our
good
King
Robert,
and
Aerys
Targaryen
before
him,
and
his
father
Jaehaerys
the
Second
before
him,
and
even
for
a
few
short
months
under
Jaehaerys’s
father,
Aegon
the
Fortunate,
the
Fifth
of
His
Name.
I
have
seen
more
of
illness
than
I
care
to
remember,
my
lord.
I
will
tell
you
this:
Every
case
is
different,
and
every
case
is
alike.
Lord
Jon’s
death
was
no
stranger
than
any
other.”

“His
wife
thought
otherwise.”

The
Grand
Maester
nodded.
“I
recall
now,
the
widow
is
sister
to
your
own
noble
wife.
If
an
old
man
may
be
forgiven
his
blunt
speech,
let
me
say
that
grief
can
derange
even
the
strongest
and
most
disciplined
of
minds,
and
the
Lady
Lysa
was
never
that.
Since
her
last
stillbirth,
she
has
seen
enemies
in
every
shadow,
and
the
death
of
her
lord
husband
left
her
shattered
and
lost.”

“So
you
are
quite
certain
that
Jon
Arryn
died
of
a
sudden
illness?”

“I
am,”
Pycelle
replied
gravely.
“If
not
illness,
my
good
lord,
what
else
could
it
be?”

“Poison,”
Ned
suggested
quietly.

Pycelle’s
sleepy
eyes
flicked
open.
The
aged
maester
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
seat.
“A
disturbing
thought.
We
are
not
the
Free
Cities,
where
such
things
are
common.
Grand
Maester
Aethelmure
wrote
that
all
men
carry
murder
in
their
hearts,
yet
even
so,
the
poisoner
is
beneath
contempt.”
He
fell
silent
for
a
moment,
his
eyes
lost
in
thought.
“What
you
suggest
is
possible,
my
lord,
yet
I
do
not
think
it
likely.
Every
hedge
maester
knows
the
common
poisons,
and
Lord
Arryn
displayed
none
of
the
signs.
And
the
Hand
was
loved
by
all.
What
sort
of
monster
in
man’s
flesh
would
dare
to
murder
such
a
noble
lord?”

“I
have
heard
it
said
that
poison
is
a
woman’s
weapon.”

Pycelle
stroked
his
beard
thoughtfully.
“It
is
said.
Women,
cravens…
and
eunuchs.”
He
cleared
his
throat
and
spat
a
thick
glob
of
phelm
onto
the
rushes.
Above
them,
a
raven
cawed
loudly
in
the
rookery.
“The
Lord
Varys
was
born
a
slave
in
Lys,
did
you
know?
Put
not
your
trust
in
spiders,
my
lord.”

That
was
scarcely
anything
Ned
needed
to
be
told;
there
was
something
about
Varys
that
made
his
flesh
crawl.
“I
will
remember
that,
Maester.
And
I
thank
you
for
your
help.
I
have
taken
enough
of
your
time.”
He
stood.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
pushed
himself
up
from
his
chair
slowly
and
escorted
Ned
to
the
door.
“I
hope
I
have
helped
in
some
small
way
to
put
your
mind
at
ease.
If
there
is
any
other
service
I
might
perform,
you
need
only
ask.”

“One
thing,”
Ned
told
him.
“I
should
be
curious
to
examine
the
book
that
you
lent
Jon
the
day
before
he
fell
ill.”

“I
fear
you
would
find
it
of
little
interest,”
Pycelle
said.
“It
was
a
ponderous
tome
by
Grand
Maester
Malleon
on
the
lineages
of
the
great
houses.”

“Still,
I
should
like
to
see
it.”

The
old
man
opened
the
door.
“As
you
wish.
I
have
it
here
somewhere.
When
I
find
it,
I
shall
have
it
sent
to
your
chambers
straightaway.”

“You
have
been
most
courteous,”
Ned
told
him.
Then,
almost
as
an
afterthought,
he
said,
“One
last
question,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.
You
mentioned
that
the
king
was
at
Lord
Arryn’s
bedside
when
he
died.
I
wonder,
was
the
queen
with
him?”

“Why,
no,”
Pycelle
said.
“She
and
the
children
were
making
the
journey
to
Casterly
Rock,
in
company
with
her
father.
Lord
Tywin
had
brought
a
retinue
to
the
city
for
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day,
no
doubt
hoping
to
see
his
son
Jaime
win
the
champion’s
crown.
In
that
he
was
sadly
disappointed.
It
fell
to
me
to
send
the
queen
word
of
Lord
Arryn’s
sudden
death.
Never
have
I
sent
off
a
bird
with
a
heavier
heart.”

“Dark
wings,
dark
words,”
Ned
murmured.
It
was
a
proverb
Old
Nan
had
taught
him
as
a
boy.

“So
the
fishwives
say,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
agreed,
“but
we
know
it
is
not
always
so.
When
Maester
Luwin’s
bird
brought
the
word
about
your
Bran,
the
message
lifted
every
true
heart
in
the
castle,
did
it
not?”

“As
you
say,
Maester.”

“The
gods
are
merciful.”
Pycelle
bowed
his
head.
“Come
to
me
as
often
as
you
like,
Lord
Eddard.
I
am
here
to
serve.”

Yes,
Ned
thought
as
the
door
swung
shut,
but
whom?

On
the
way
back
to
his
chambers,
he
came
upon
his
daughter
Arya
on
the
winding
steps
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
windmilling
her
arms
as
she
struggled
to
balance
on
one
leg.
The
rough
stone
had
scuffed
her
bare
feet.
Ned
stopped
and
looked
at
her.
“Arya,
what
are
you
doing?”

“Syrio
says
a
water
dancer
can
stand
on
one
toe
for
hours.”
Her
hands
flailed
at
the
air
to
steady
herself.

Ned
had
to
smile.
“Which
toe?”
he
teased.

“Any
toe,”
Arya
said,
exasperated
with
the
question.
She
hopped
from
her
right
leg
to
her
left,
swaying
dangerously
before
she
regained
her
balance.

“Must
you
do
your
standing
here?”
he
asked.
“It’s
a
long
hard
fall
down
these
steps.”

“Syrio
says
a
water
dancer
never
falls.”
She
lowered
her
leg
to
stand
on
two
feet.
“Father,
will
Bran
come
and
live
with
us
now?”

“Not
for
a
long
time,
sweet
one,”
he
told
her.
“He
needs
to
win
his
strength
back.”

Arya
bit
her
lip.
“What
will
Bran
do
when
he’s
of
age?”

Ned
knelt
beside
her.
“He
has
years
to
find
that
answer,
Arya.
For
now,
it
is
enough
to
know
that
he
will
live.”
The
night
the
bird
had
come
from
Winterfell,
Eddard
Stark
had
taken
the
girls
to
the
castle
godswood,
an
acre
of
elm
and
alder
and
black
cottonwood
overlooking
the
river.
The
heart
tree
there
was
a
great
oak,
its
ancient
limbs
overgrown
with
smokeberry
vines;
they
knelt
before
it
to
offer
their
thanksgiving,
as
if
it
had
been
a
weirwood.
Sansa
drifted
to
sleep
as
the
moon
rose,
Arya
several
hours
later,
curling
up
in
the
grass
under
Ned’s
cloak.
All
through
the
dark
hours
he
kept
his
vigil
alone.
When
dawn
broke
over
the
city,
the
dark
red
blooms
of
dragon’s
breath
surrounded
the
girls
where
they
lay.
“I
dreamed
of
Bran,”
Sansa
had
whispered
to
him.
“I
saw
him
smiling.”

“He
was
going
to
be
a
knight,”
Arya
was
saying
now.
“A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
Can
he
still
be
a
knight?”

“No,”
Ned
said.
He
saw
no
use
in
lying
to
her.
“Yet
someday
he
may
be
the
lord
of
a
great
holdfast
and
sit
on
the
king’s
council.
He
might
raise
castles
like
Brandon
the
Builder,
or
sail
a
ship
across
the
Sunset
Sea,
or
enter
your
mother’s
Faith
and
become
the
High
Septon.”
But
he
will
never
run
beside
his
wolf
again,
he
thought
with
a
sadness
too
deep
for
words,
or
lie
with
a
woman,
or
hold
his
own
son
in
his
arms.

Arya
cocked
her
head
to
one
side.
“Can
I
be
a
king’s
councillor
and
build
castles
and
become
the
High
Septon?”

“You,”
Ned
said,
kissing
her
lightly
on
the
brow,
“will
marry
a
king
and
rule
his
castle,
and
your
sons
will
be
knights
and
princes
and
lords
and,
yes,
perhaps
even
a
High
Septon.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face.
“No,”
she
said,
“that’s
Sansa.”
She
folded
up
her
right
leg
and
resumed
her
balancing.
Ned
sighed
and
left
her
there.

Inside
his
chambers,
he
stripped
off
his
sweat-stained
silks
and
sluiced
cold
water
over
his
head
from
the
basin
beside
the
bed.
Alyn
entered
as
he
was
drying
his
face.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“Lord
Baelish
is
without
and
begs
audience.”

“Escort
him
to
my
solar,”
Ned
said,
reaching
for
a
fresh
tunic,
the
lightest
linen
he
could
find.
“I’ll
see
him
at
once.”

Littlefinger
was
perched
on
the
window
seat
when
Ned
entered,
watching
the
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
practice
at
swords
in
the
yard
below.
“If
only
old
Selmy’s
mind
were
as
nimble
as
his
blade,”
he
said
wistfully,
“our
council
meetings
would
be
a
good
deal
livelier.”

“Ser
Barristan
is
as
valiant
and
honorable
as
any
man
in
King’s
Landing.”
Ned
had
come
to
have
a
deep
respect
for
the
aged,
white-haired
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.

“And
as
tiresome,”
Littlefinger
added,
“though
I
daresay
he
should
do
well
in
the
tourney.
Last
year
he
unhorsed
the
Hound,
and
it
was
only
four
years
ago
that
he
was
champion.”

The
question
of
who
might
win
the
tourney
interested
Eddard
Stark
not
in
the
least.
“Is
there
a
reason
for
this
visit,
Lord
Petyr,
or
are
you
here
simply
to
enjoy
the
view
from
my
window?”

Littlefinger
smiled.
“I
promised
Cat
I
would
help
you
in
your
inquiries,
and
so
I
have.”

That
took
Ned
aback.
Promise
or
no
promise,
he
could
not
find
it
in
him
to
trust
Lord
Petyr
Baelish,
who
struck
him
as
too
clever
by
half.
“You
have
something
for
me?”

“Someone,”
Littlefinger
corrected.
“Four
someones,
if
truth
be
told.
Had
you
thought
to
question
the
Hand’s
servants?”

Ned
frowned.
“Would
that
I
could.
Lady
Arryn
took
her
household
back
to
the
Eyrie.”
Lysa
had
done
him
no
favor
in
that
regard.
All
those
who
had
stood
closest
to
her
husband
had
gone
with
her
when
she
fled:
Jon’s
maester,
his
steward,
the
captain
of
his
guard,
his
knights
and
retainers.

“Most
of
her
household,”
Littlefinger
said,
“not
all.
A
few
remain.
A
pregnant
kitchen
girl
hastily
wed
to
one
of
Lord
Renly’s
grooms,
a
stablehand
who
joined
the
City
Watch,
a
potboy
discharged
from
service
for
theft,
and
Lord
Arryn’s
squire.”

“His
squire?”
Ned
was
pleasantly
surprised.
A
man’s
squire
often
knew
a
great
deal
of
his
comings
and
goings.

“Ser
Hugh
of
the
Vale,”
Littlefinger
named
him.
“The
king
knighted
the
boy
after
Lord
Arryn’s
death.”

“I
shall
send
for
him,”
Ned
said.
“And
the
others.”

Littlefinger
winced.
“My
lord,
step
over
here
to
the
window,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

“Why?”

“Come,
and
I’ll
show
you,
my
lord.”

Frowning,
Ned
crossed
to
the
window.
Petyr
Baelish
made
a
casual
gesture.
“There,
across
the
yard,
at
the
door
of
the
armory,
do
you
see
the
boy
squatting
by
the
steps
honing
a
sword
with
an
oilstone?”

“What
of
him?”

“He
reports
to
Varys.
The
Spider
has
taken
a
great
interest
in
you
and
all
your
doings.”
He
shifted
in
the
window
seat.
“Now
glance
at
the
wall.
Farther
west,
above
the
stables.
The
guardsman
leaning
on
the
ramparts?”

Ned
saw
the
man.
“Another
of
the
eunuch’s
whisperers?”

“No,
this
one
belongs
to
the
queen.
Notice
that
he
enjoys
a
fine
view
of
the
door
to
this
tower,
the
better
to
note
who
calls
on
you.
There
are
others,
many
unknown
even
to
me.
The
Red
Keep
is
full
of
eyes.
Why
do
you
think
I
hid
Cat
in
a
brothel?”

Eddard
Stark
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues.
“Seven
hells,”
he
swore.
It
did
seem
as
though
the
man
on
the
walls
was
watching
him.
Suddenly
uncomfortable,
Ned
moved
away
from
the
window.
“Is
everyone
someone’s
informer
in
this
cursed
city?”

“Scarcely,”
said
Littlefinger.
He
counted
on
the
fingers
on
his
hand.
“Why,
there’s
me,
you,
the
king…
although,
come
to
think
on
it,
the
king
tells
the
queen
much
too
much,
and
I’m
less
than
certain
about
you.”
He
stood
up.
“Is
there
a
man
in
your
service
that
you
trust
utterly
and
completely?”

“Yes,”
said
Ned.

“In
that
case,
I
have
a
delightful
palace
in
Valyria
that
I
would
dearly
love
to
sell
you,”
Littlefinger
said
with
a
mocking
smile.
“The
wiser
answer
was
no,
my
lord,
but
be
that
as
it
may.
Send
this
paragon
of
yours
to
Ser
Hugh
and
the
others.
Your
own
comings
and
goings
will
be
noted,
but
even
Varys
the
Spider
cannot
watch
every
man
in
your
service
every
hour
of
the
day.”
He
started
for
the
door.

“Lord
Petyr,”
Ned
called
after
him.
“I…
am
grateful
for
your
help.
Perhaps
I
was
wrong
to
distrust
you.”

Littlefinger
fingered
his
small
pointed
beard.
“You
are
slow
to
learn,
Lord
Eddard.
Distrusting
me
was
the
wisest
thing
you’ve
done
since
you
climbed
down
off
your
horse.”





JON

Jon
was
showing
Dareon
how
best
to
deliver
a
sidestroke
when
the
new
recruit
entered
the
practice
yard.
“Your
feet
should
be
farther
apart,”
he
urged.
“You
don’t
want
to
lose
your
balance.
That’s
good.
Now
pivot
as
you
deliver
the
stroke,
get
all
your
weight
behind
the
blade.”

Dareon
broke
off
and
lifted
his
visor.
“Seven
gods,”
he
murmured.
“Would
you
look
at
this,
Jon.”

Jon
turned.
Through
the
eye
slit
of
his
helm,
he
beheld
the
fattest
boy
he
had
ever
seen
standing
in
the
door
of
the
armory.
By
the
look
of
him,
he
must
have
weighed
twenty
stone.
The
fur
collar
of
his
embroidered
surcoat
was
lost
beneath
his
chins.
Pale
eyes
moved
nervously
in
a
great
round
moon
of
a
face,
and
plump
sweaty
fingers
wiped
themselves
on
the
velvet
of
his
doublet.
“They…
they
told
me
I
was
to
come
here
for…
for
training,”
he
said
to
no
one
in
particular.

“A
lordling,”
Pyp
observed
to
Jon.
“Southron,
most
like
near
Highgarden.”
Pyp
had
traveled
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
a
mummers’
troupe,
and
bragged
that
he
could
tell
what
you
were
and
where
you’d
been
born
just
from
the
sound
of
your
voice.

A
striding
huntsman
had
been
worked
in
scarlet
thread
upon
the
breast
of
the
fat
boy’s
fur-trimmed
surcoat.
Jon
did
not
recognize
the
sigil.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
looked
over
his
new
charge
and
said,
“It
would
seem
they
have
run
short
of
poachers
and
thieves
down
south.
Now
they
send
us
pigs
to
man
the
Wall.
Is
fur
and
velvet
your
notion
of
armor,
my
Lord
of
Ham?”

It
was
soon
revealed
that
the
new
recruit
had
brought
his
own
armor
with
him;
padded
doublet,
boiled
leather,
mail
and
plate
and
helm,
even
a
great
wood-and-leather
shield
blazoned
with
the
same
striding
huntsman
he
wore
on
his
surcoat.
As
none
of
it
was
black,
however,
Ser
Alliser
insisted
that
he
reequip
himself
from
the
armory.
That
took
half
the
morning.
His
girth
required
Donal
Noye
to
take
apart
a
mail
hauberk
and
refit
it
with
leather
panels
at
the
sides.
To
get
a
helm
over
his
head
the
armorer
had
to
detach
the
visor.
His
leathers
bound
so
tightly
around
his
legs
and
under
his
arms
that
he
could
scarcely
move.
Dressed
for
battle,
the
new
boy
looked
like
an
overcooked
sausage
about
to
burst
its
skin.
“Let
us
hope
you
are
not
as
inept
as
you
look,”
Ser
Alliser
said.
“Halder,
see
what
Ser
Piggy
can
do.”

Jon
Snow
winced.
Halder
had
been
born
in
a
quarry
and
apprenticed
as
a
stonemason.
He
was
sixteen,
tall
and
muscular,
and
his
blows
were
as
hard
as
any
Jon
had
ever
felt.
“This
will
be
uglier
than
a
whore’s
ass,”
Pyp
muttered,
and
it
was.

The
fight
lasted
less
than
a
minute
before
the
fat
boy
was
on
the
ground,
his
whole
body
shaking
as
blood
leaked
through
his
shattered
helm
and
between
his
pudgy
fingers.
“I
yield,”
he
shrilled.
“No
more,
I
yield,
don’t
hit
me.”
Rast
and
some
of
the
other
boys
were
laughing.

Even
then,
Ser
Alliser
would
not
call
an
end.
“On
your
feet,
Ser
Piggy,”
he
called.
“Pick
up
your
sword.”
When
the
boy
continued
to
cling
to
the
ground,
Thorne
gestured
to
Halder.
“Hit
him
with
the
flat
of
your
blade
until
he
finds
his
feet.”
Halder
delivered
a
tentative
smack
to
his
foe’s
upraised
cheeks.
“You
can
hit
harder
than
that,”
Thorne
taunted.
Halder
took
hold
of
his
longsword
with
both
hands
and
brought
it
down
so
hard
the
blow
split
leather,
even
on
the
flat.
The
new
boy
screeched
in
pain.

Jon
Snow
took
a
step
forward.
Pyp
laid
a
mailed
hand
on
his
arm.
“Jon,
no,”
the
small
boy
whispered
with
an
anxious
glance
at
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.

“On
your
feet,”
Thorne
repeated.
The
fat
boy
struggled
to
rise,
slipped,
and
fell
heavily
again.
“Ser
Piggy
is
starting
to
grasp
the
notion,”
Ser
Alliser
observed.
“Again.”

Halder
lifted
the
sword
for
another
blow.
“Cut
us
off
a
ham!”
Rast
urged,
laughing.

Jon
shook
off
Pyp’s
hand.
“Halder,
enough.”

Halder
looked
to
Ser
Alliser.

“The
Bastard
speaks
and
the
peasants
tremble,”
the
master-at-arms
said
in
that
sharp,
cold
voice
of
his.
“I
remind
you
that
I
am
the
master-at-arms
here,
Lord
Snow.”

“Look
at
him,
Halder,”
Jon
urged,
ignoring
Thorne
as
best
he
could.
“There’s
no
honor
in
beating
a
fallen
foe.
He
yielded.”
He
knelt
beside
the
fat
boy.

Halder
lowered
his
sword.
“He
yielded,”
he
echoed.

Ser
Alliser’s
onyx
eyes
were
fixed
on
Jon
Snow.
“It
would
seem
our
Bastard
is
in
love,”
he
said
as
Jon
helped
the
fat
boy
to
his
feet.
“Show
me
your
steel,
Lord
Snow.”

Jon
drew
his
longsword.
He
dared
defy
Ser
Alliser
only
to
a
point,
and
he
feared
he
was
well
beyond
it
now.

Thorne
smiled.
“The
Bastard
wishes
to
defend
his
lady
love,
so
we
shall
make
an
exercise
of
it.
Rat,
Pimple,
help
our
Stone
Head
here.”
Rast
and
Albett
moved
to
join
Halder.
“Three
of
you
ought
to
be
sufficient
to
make
Lady
Piggy
squeal.
All
you
need
do
is
get
past
the
Bastard.”

“Stay
behind
me,”
Jon
said
to
the
fat
boy.
Ser
Alliser
had
often
sent
two
foes
against
him,
but
never
three.
He
knew
he
would
likely
go
to
sleep
bruised
and
bloody
tonight.
He
braced
himself
for
the
assault.

Suddenly
Pyp
was
beside
him.
“Three
to
two
will
make
for
better
sport,”
the
small
boy
said
cheerfully.
He
dropped
his
visor
and
slid
out
his
sword.
Before
Jon
could
even
think
to
protest,
Grenn
had
stepped
up
to
make
a
third.

The
yard
had
grown
deathly
quiet.
Jon
could
feel
Ser
Alliser’s
eyes.
“Why
are
you
waiting?”
he
asked
Rast
and
the
others
in
a
voice
gone
deceptively
soft,
but
it
was
Jon
who
moved
first.
Halder
barely
got
his
sword
up
in
time.

Jon
drove
him
backward,
attacking
with
every
blow,
keeping
the
older
boy
on
the
heels.
Know
your
foe,
Ser
Rodrik
had
taught
him
once;
Jon
knew
Halder,
brutally
strong
but
short
of
patience,
with
no
taste
for
defense.
Frustrate
him,
and
he
would
leave
himself
open,
as
certain
as
sunset.

The
clang
of
steel
echoed
through
the
yard
as
the
others
joined
battle
around
him.
Jon
blocked
a
savage
cut
at
his
head,
the
shock
of
impact
running
up
his
arm
as
the
swords
crashed
together.
He
slammed
a
sidestroke
into
Halder’s
ribs,
and
was
rewarded
with
a
muffled
grunt
of
pain.
The
counterstroke
caught
Jon
on
the
shoulder.
Chainmail
crunched,
and
pain
flared
up
his
neck,
but
for
an
instant
Halder
was
unbalanced.
Jon
cut
his
left
leg
from
under
him,
and
he
fell
with
a
curse
and
a
crash.

Grenn
was
standing
his
ground
as
Jon
had
taught
him,
giving
Albett
more
than
he
cared
for,
but
Pyp
was
hard-pressed.
Rast
had
two
years
and
forty
pounds
on
him.
Jon
stepped
up
behind
him
and
rang
the
raper’s
helm
like
a
bell.
As
Rast
went
reeling,
Pyp
slid
in
under
his
guard,
knocked
him
down,
and
leveled
a
blade
at
his
throat.
By
then
Jon
had
moved
on.
Facing
two
swords,
Albett
backed
away.
“I
yield,”
he
shouted.

Ser
Alliser
Thorne
surveyed
the
scene
with
disgust.
“The
mummer’s
farce
has
gone
on
long
enough
for
today.”
He
walked
away.
The
session
was
at
an
end.

Dareon
helped
Halder
to
his
feet.
The
quarryman’s
son
wrenched
off
his
helm
and
threw
it
across
the
yard.
“For
an
instant,
I
thought
I
finally
had
you,
Snow.”

“For
an
instant,
you
did,”
Jon
replied.
Under
his
mail
and
leather,
his
shoulder
was
throbbing.
He
sheathed
his
sword
and
tried
to
remove
his
helm,
but
when
he
raised
his
arm,
the
pain
made
him
grit
his
teeth.

“Let
me,”
a
voice
said.
Thick-fingered
hands
unfastened
helm
from
gorget
and
lifted
it
off
gently.
“Did
he
hurt
you?”

“I’ve
been
bruised
before.”
He
touched
his
shoulder
and
winced.
The
yard
was
emptying
around
them.

Blood
matted
the
fat
boy’s
hair
where
Halder
had
split
his
helm
asunder.
“My
name
is
Samwell
Tarly,
of
Horn…”
He
stopped
and
licked
his
lips.
“I
mean,
I
was
of
Horn
Hill,
until
I…
left.
I’ve
come
to
take
the
black.
My
father
is
Lord
Randyll,
a
bannerman
to
the
Tyrells
of
Highgarden.
I
used
to
be
his
heir,
only…”
His
voice
trailed
off.

“I’m
Jon
Snow,
Ned
Stark’s
bastard,
of
Winterfell.”

Samwell
Tarly
nodded.
“I…
if
you
want,
you
can
call
me
Sam.
My
mother
calls
me
Sam.”

“You
can
call
him
Lord
Snow,”
Pyp
said
as
he
came
up
to
join
them.
“You
don’t
want
to
know
what
his
mother
calls
him.”

“These
two
are
Grenn
and
Pypar,”
Jon
said.

“Grenn’s
the
ugly
one,”
Pyp
said.

Grenn
scowled.
“You’re
uglier
than
me.
At
least
I
don’t
have
ears
like
a
bat.”

“My
thanks
to
all
of
you,”
the
fat
boy
said
gravely.

“Why
didn’t
you
get
up
and
fight?”
Grenn
demanded.

“I
wanted
to,
truly.
I
just…
I
couldn’t.
I
didn’t
want
him
to
hit
me
anymore.”
He
looked
at
the
ground.
“I…
I
fear
I’m
a
coward.
My
lord
father
always
said
so.”

Grenn
looked
thunderstruck.
Even
Pyp
had
no
words
to
say
to
that,
and
Pyp
had
words
for
everything.
What
sort
of
man
would
proclaim
himself
a
coward?

Samwell
Tarly
must
have
read
their
thoughts
on
their
faces.
His
eyes
met
Jon’s
and
darted
away,
quick
as
frightened
animals.
“I…
I’m
sorry,”
he
said.
“I
don’t
mean
to…
to
be
like
I
am.”
He
walked
heavily
toward
the
armory.

Jon
called
after
him.
“You
were
hurt,”
he
said.
“Tomorrow
you’ll
do
better.”

Sam
looked
mournfully
back
over
one
shoulder.
“No
I
won’t,”
he
said,
blinking
back
tears.
“I
never
do
better.”

When
he
was
gone,
Grenn
frowned.
“Nobody
likes
cravens,”
he
said
uncomfortably.
“I
wish
we
hadn’t
helped
him.
What
if
they
think
we’re
craven
too?”

“You’re
too
stupid
to
be
craven,”
Pyp
told
him.

“I
am
not,”
Grenn
said.

“Yes
you
are.
If
a
bear
attacked
you
in
the
woods,
you’d
be
too
stupid
to
run
away.”

“I
would
not,”
Grenn
insisted.
“I’d
run
away
faster
than
you.”
He
stopped
suddenly,
scowling
when
he
saw
Pyp’s
grin
and
realized
what
he’d
just
said.
His
thick
neck
flushed
a
dark
red.
Jon
left
them
there
arguing
as
he
returned
to
the
armory,
hung
up
his
sword,
and
stripped
off
his
battered
armor.

Life
at
Castle
Black
followed
certain
patterns;
the
mornings
were
for
swordplay,
the
afternoons
for
work.
The
black
brothers
set
new
recruits
to
many
different
tasks,
to
learn
where
their
skills
lay.
Jon
cherished
the
rare
afternoons
when
he
was
sent
out
with
Ghost
ranging
at
his
side
to
bring
back
game
for
the
Lord
Commander’s
table,
but
for
every
day
spent
hunting,
he
gave
a
dozen
to
Donal
Noye
in
the
armory,
spinning
the
whetstone
while
the
one-armed
smith
sharpened
axes
grown
dull
from
use,
or
pumping
the
bellows
as
Noye
hammered
out
a
new
sword.
Other
times
he
ran
messages,
stood
at
guard,
mucked
out
stables,
fletched
arrows,
assisted
Maester
Aemon
with
his
birds
or
Bowen
Marsh
with
his
counts
and
inventories.

That
afternoon,
the
watch
commander
sent
him
to
the
winch
cage
with
four
barrels
of
fresh-crushed
stone,
to
scatter
gravel
over
the
icy
footpaths
atop
the
Wall.
It
was
lonely
and
boring
work,
even
with
Ghost
along
for
company,
but
Jon
found
he
did
not
mind.
On
a
clear
day
you
could
see
half
the
world
from
the
top
of
the
Wall,
and
the
air
was
always
cold
and
bracing.
He
could
think
here,
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
Samwell
Tarly…
and,
oddly,
of
Tyrion
Lannister.
He
wondered
what
Tyrion
would
have
made
of
the
fat
boy.
Most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it,
the
dwarf
had
told
him,
grinning.
The
world
was
full
of
cravens
who
pretended
to
be
heroes;
it
took
a
queer
sort
of
courage
to
admit
to
cowardice
as
Samwell
Tarly
had.

His
sore
shoulder
made
the
work
go
slowly.
It
was
late
afternoon
before
Jon
finished
graveling
the
paths.
He
lingered
on
high
to
watch
the
sun
go
down,
turning
the
western
sky
the
color
of
blood.
Finally,
as
dusk
was
settling
over
the
north,
Jon
rolled
the
empty
barrels
back
into
the
cage
and
signaled
the
winch
men
to
lower
him.

The
evening
meal
was
almost
done
by
the
time
he
and
Ghost
reached
the
common
hall.
A
group
of
the
black
brothers
were
dicing
over
mulled
wine
near
the
fire.
His
friends
were
at
the
bench
nearest
the
west
wall,
laughing.
Pyp
was
in
the
middle
of
a
story.
The
mummer’s
boy
with
the
big
ears
was
a
born
liar
with
a
hundred
different
voices,
and
he
did
not
tell
his
tales
so
much
as
live
them,
playing
all
the
parts
as
needed,
a
king
one
moment
and
a
swineherd
the
next.
When
he
turned
into
an
alehouse
girl
or
a
virgin
princess,
he
used
a
high
falsetto
voice
that
reduced
them
all
to
tears
of
helpless
laughter,
and
his
eunuchs
were
always
eerily
accurate
caricatures
of
Ser
Alliser.
Jon
took
as
much
pleasure
from
Pyp’s
antics
as
anyone…
yet
that
night
he
turned
away
and
went
instead
to
the
end
of
the
bench,
where
Samwell
Tarly
sat
alone,
as
far
from
the
others
as
he
could
get.

He
was
finishing
the
last
of
the
pork
pie
the
cooks
had
served
up
for
supper
when
Jon
sat
down
across
from
him.
The
fat
boy’s
eyes
widened
at
the
sight
of
Ghost.
“Is
that
a
wolf?”

“A
direwolf,”
Jon
said.
“His
name
is
Ghost.
The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
my
father’s
House.”

“Ours
is
a
striding
huntsman,”
Samwell
Tarly
said.

“Do
you
like
to
hunt?”

The
fat
boy
shuddered.
“I
hate
it.”
He
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
cry
again.

“What’s
wrong
now?”
Jon
asked
him.
“Why
are
you
always
so
frightened?”

Sam
stared
at
the
last
of
his
pork
pie
and
gave
a
feeble
shake
of
his
head,
too
scared
even
to
talk.
A
burst
of
laughter
filled
the
hall.
Jon
heard
Pyp
squeaking
in
a
high
voice.
He
stood.
“Let’s
go
outside.”

The
round
fat
face
looked
up
at
him,
suspicious.
“Why?
What
will
we
do
outside?”

“Talk,”
Jon
said.
“Have
you
seen
the
Wall?”

“I’m
fat,
not
blind,”
Samwell
Tarly
said.
“Of
course
I
saw
it,
it’s
seven
hundred
feet
high.”
Yet
he
stood
up
all
the
same,
wrapped
a
fur-lined
cloak
over
his
shoulders,
and
followed
Jon
from
the
common
hall,
still
wary,
as
if
he
suspected
some
cruel
trick
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
night.
Ghost
padded
along
beside
them.
“I
never
thought
it
would
be
like
this,”
Sam
said
as
they
walked,
his
words
steaming
in
the
cold
air.
Already
he
was
huffing
and
puffing
as
he
tried
to
keep
up.
“All
the
buildings
are
falling
down,
and
it’s
so…
so…”

“Cold?”
A
hard
frost
was
settling
over
the
castle,
and
Jon
could
hear
the
soft
crunch
of
grey
weeds
beneath
his
boots.

Sam
nodded
miserably.
“I
hate
the
cold,”
he
said.
“Last
night
I
woke
up
in
the
dark
and
the
fire
had
gone
out
and
I
was
certain
I
was
going
to
freeze
to
death
by
morning.”

“It
must
have
been
warmer
where
you
come
from.”

“I
never
saw
snow
until
last
month.
We
were
crossing
the
barrowlands,
me
and
the
men
my
father
sent
to
see
me
north,
and
this
white
stuff
began
to
fall,
like
a
soft
rain.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
so
beautiful,
like
feathers
drifting
from
the
sky,
but
it
kept
on
and
on,
until
I
was
frozen
to
the
bone.
The
men
had
crusts
of
snow
in
their
beards
and
more
on
their
shoulders,
and
still
it
kept
coming.
I
was
afraid
it
would
never
end.”

Jon
smiled.

The
Wall
loomed
before
them,
glimmering
palely
in
the
light
of
the
half
moon.
In
the
sky
above,
the
stars
burned
clear
and
sharp.
“Are
they
going
to
make
me
go
up
there?”
Sam
asked.
His
face
curdled
like
old
milk
as
he
looked
at
the
great
wooden
stairs.
“I’ll
die
if
I
have
to
climb
that.”

“There’s
a
winch,”
Jon
said,
pointing.
“They
can
draw
you
up
in
a
cage.”

Samwell
Tarly
sniffled.
“I
don’t
like
high
places.”

It
was
too
much.
Jon
frowned,
incredulous.
“Are
you
afraid
of
everything?”
he
asked.
“I
don’t
understand.
If
you
are
truly
so
craven,
why
are
you
here?
Why
would
a
coward
want
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch?”

Samwell
Tarly
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment,
and
his
round
face
seemed
to
cave
in
on
itself.
He
sat
down
on
the
frost-covered
ground
and
began
to
cry,
huge
choking
sobs
that
made
his
whole
body
shake.
Jon
Snow
could
only
stand
and
watch.
Like
the
snowfall
on
the
barrowlands,
it
seemed
the
tears
would
never
end.

It
was
Ghost
who
knew
what
to
do.
Silent
as
shadow,
the
pale
direwolf
moved
closer
and
began
to
lick
the
warm
tears
off
Samwell
Tarly’s
face.
The
fat
boy
cried
out,
startled…
and
somehow,
in
a
heartbeat,
his
sobs
turned
to
laughter.

Jon
Snow
laughed
with
him.
Afterward
they
sat
on
the
frozen
ground,
huddled
in
their
cloaks
with
Ghost
between
them.
Jon
told
the
story
of
how
he
and
Robb
had
found
the
pups
newborn
in
the
late
summer
snows.
It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
now.
Before
long
he
found
himself
talking
of
Winterfell.

“Sometimes
I
dream
about
it,”
he
said.
“I’m
walking
down
this
long
empty
hall.
My
voice
echoes
all
around,
but
no
one
answers,
so
I
walk
faster,
opening
doors,
shouting
names.
I
don’t
even
know
who
I’m
looking
for.
Most
nights
it’s
my
father,
but
sometimes
it’s
Robb
instead,
or
my
little
sister
Arya,
or
my
uncle.”
The
thought
of
Benjen
Stark
saddened
him;
his
uncle
was
still
missing.
The
Old
Bear
had
sent
out
rangers
in
search
of
him.
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
had
led
two
sweeps,
and
Quorin
Halfhand
had
gone
forth
from
the
Shadow
Tower,
but
they’d
found
nothing
aside
from
a
few
blazes
in
the
trees
that
his
uncle
had
left
to
mark
his
way.
In
the
stony
highlands
to
the
northwest,
the
marks
stopped
abruptly
and
all
trace
of
Ben
Stark
vanished.

“Do
you
ever
find
anyone
in
your
dream?”
Sam
asked.

Jon
shook
his
head.
“No
one.
The
castle
is
always
empty.”
He
had
never
told
anyone
of
the
dream,
and
he
did
not
understand
why
he
was
telling
Sam
now,
yet
somehow
it
felt
good
to
talk
of
it.
“Even
the
ravens
are
gone
from
the
rookery,
and
the
stables
are
full
of
bones.
That
always
scares
me.
I
start
to
run
then,
throwing
open
doors,
climbing
the
tower
three
steps
at
a
time,
screaming
for
someone,
for
anyone.
And
then
I
find
myself
in
front
of
the
door
to
the
crypts.
It’s
black
inside,
and
I
can
see
the
steps
spiraling
down.
Somehow
I
know
I
have
to
go
down
there,
but
I
don’t
want
to.
I’m
afraid
of
what
might
be
waiting
for
me.
The
old
Kings
of
Winter
are
down
there,
sitting
on
their
thrones
with
stone
wolves
at
their
feet
and
iron
swords
across
their
laps,
but
it’s
not
them
I’m
afraid
of.
I
scream
that
I’m
not
a
Stark,
that
this
isn’t
my
place,
but
it’s
no
good,
I
have
to
go
anyway,
so
I
start
down,
feeling
the
walls
as
I
descend,
with
no
torch
to
light
the
way.
It
gets
darker
and
darker,
until
I
want
to
scream.”
He
stopped,
frowning,
embarrassed.
“That’s
when
I
always
wake.”
His
skin
cold
and
clammy,
shivering
in
the
darkness
of
his
cell.
Ghost
would
leap
up
beside
him,
his
warmth
as
comforting
as
daybreak.
He
would
go
back
to
sleep
with
his
face
pressed
into
the
direwolf
s
shaggy
white
fur.
“Do
you
dream
of
Horn
Hill?”
Jon
asked.

“No.”
Sam’s
mouth
grew
tight
and
hard.
“I
hated
it
there.”
He
scratched
Ghost
behind
the
ear,
brooding,
and
Jon
let
the
silence
breathe.
After
a
long
while
Samwell
Tarly
began
to
talk,
and
Jon
Snow
listened
quietly,
and
learned
how
it
was
that
a
self-confessed
coward
found
himself
on
the
Wall.

The
Tarlys
were
a
family
old
in
honor,
bannermen
to
Mace
Tyrell,
Lord
of
Highgarden
and
Warden
of
the
South.
The
eldest
son
of
Lord
Randyll
Tarly,
Samwell
was
born
heir
to
rich
lands,
a
strong
keep,
and
a
storied
two-handed
greatsword
named
Heartsbane,
forged
of
Valyrian
steel
and
passed
down
from
father
to
son
near
five
hundred
years.

Whatever
pride
his
lord
father
might
have
felt
at
Samwell’s
birth
vanished
as
the
boy
grew
up
plump,
soft,
and
awkward.
Sam
loved
to
listen
to
music
and
make
his
own
songs,
to
wear
soft
velvets,
to
play
in
the
castle
kitchen
beside
the
cooks,
drinking
in
the
rich
smells
as
he
snitched
lemon
cakes
and
blueberry
tarts.
His
passions
were
books
and
kittens
and
dancing,
clumsy
as
he
was.
But
he
grew
ill
at
the
sight
of
blood,
and
wept
to
see
even
a
chicken
slaughtered.
A
dozen
masters-at-arms
came
and
went
at
Horn
Hill,
trying
to
turn
Samwell
into
the
knight
his
father
wanted.
The
boy
was
cursed
and
caned,
slapped
and
starved.
One
man
had
him
sleep
in
his
chainmail
to
make
him
more
martial.
Another
dressed
him
in
his
mother’s
clothing
and
paraded
him
through
the
bailey
to
shame
him
into
valor.
He
only
grew
fatter
and
more
frightened,
until
Lord
Randyll’s
disappointment
turned
to
anger
and
then
to
loathing.
“One
time,”
Sam
confided,
his
voice
dropping
from
a
whisper,
“two
men
came
to
the
castle,
warlocks
from
Qarth
with
white
skin
and
blue
lips.
They
slaughtered
a
bull
aurochs
and
made
me
bathe
in
the
hot
blood,
but
it
didn’t
make
me
brave
as
they’d
promised.
I
got
sick
and
retched.
Father
had
them
scourged.”

Finally,
after
three
girls
in
as
many
years,
Lady
Tarly
gave
her
lord
husband
a
second
son.
From
that
day,
Lord
Randyll
ignored
Sam,
devoting
all
his
time
to
the
younger
boy,
a
fierce,
robust
child
more
to
his
liking.
Samwell
had
known
several
years
of
sweet
peace
with
his
music
and
his
books.

Until
the
dawn
of
his
fifteenth
name
day,
when
he
had
been
awakened
to
find
his
horse
saddled
and
ready.
Three
men-at-arms
had
escorted
him
into
a
wood
near
Horn
Hill,
where
his
father
was
skinning
a
deer.
“You
are
almost
a
man
grown
now,
and
my
heir,”
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
had
told
his
eldest
son,
his
long
knife
laying
bare
the
carcass
as
he
spoke.
“You
have
given
me
no
cause
to
disown
you,
but
neither
will
I
allow
you
to
inherit
the
land
and
title
that
should
be
Dickon’s.
Heartsbane
must
go
to
a
man
strong
enough
to
wield
her,
and
you
are
not
worthy
to
touch
her
hilt.
So
I
have
decided
that
you
shall
this
day
announce
that
you
wish
to
take
the
black.
You
will
forsake
all
claim
to
your
brother’s
inheritance
and
start
north
before
evenfall.

“If
you
do
not,
then
on
the
morrow
we
shall
have
a
hunt,
and
somewhere
in
these
woods
your
horse
will
stumble,
and
you
will
be
thrown
from
the
saddle
to
die…
or
so
I
will
tell
your
mother.
She
has
a
woman’s
heart
and
finds
it
in
her
to
cherish
even
you,
and
I
have
no
wish
to
cause
her
pain.
Please
do
not
imagine
that
it
will
truly
be
that
easy,
should
you
think
to
defy
me.
Nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
hunt
you
down
like
the
pig
you
are.”
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow
as
he
laid
the
skinning
knife
aside.
“So.
There
is
your
choice.
The
Night’s
Watch”—he
reached
inside
the
deer,
ripped
out
its
heart,
and
held
it
in
his
fist,
red
and
dripping—“or
this.”

Sam
told
the
tale
in
a
calm,
dead
voice,
as
if
it
were
something
that
had
happened
to
someone
else,
not
to
him.
And
strangely,
Jon
thought,
he
did
not
weep,
not
even
once.
When
he
was
done,
they
sat
together
and
listened
to
the
wind
for
a
time.
There
was
no
other
sound
in
all
the
world.

Finally
Jon
said,
“We
should
go
back
to
the
common
hall.”

“Why?”
Sam
asked.

Jon
shrugged.
“There’s
hot
cider
to
drink,
or
mulled
wine
if
you
prefer.
Some
nights
Dareon
sings
for
us,
if
the
mood
is
on
him.
He
was
a
singer,
before…
well,
not
truly,
but
almost,
an
apprentice
singer.”

“How
did
he
come
here?”
Sam
asked.

“Lord
Rowan
of
Goldengrove
found
him
in
bed
with
his
daughter.
The
girl
was
two
years
older,
and
Dareon
swears
she
helped
him
through
her
window,
but
under
her
father’s
eye
she
named
it
rape,
so
here
he
is.
When
Maester
Aemon
heard
him
sing,
he
said
his
voice
was
honey
poured
over
thunder.”
Jon
smiled.
“Toad
sometimes
sings
too,
if
you
call
it
singing.
Drinking
songs
he
learned
in
his
father’s
winesink.
Pyp
says
his
voice
is
piss
poured
over
a
fart.”
They
laughed
at
that
together.

“I
should
like
to
hear
them
both,”
Sam
admitted,
“but
they
would
not
want
me
there.”
His
face
was
troubled.
“He’s
going
to
make
me
fight
again
on
the
morrow,
isn’t
he?”

“He
is,”
Jon
was
forced
to
say.

Sam
got
awkwardly
to
his
feet.
“I
had
better
try
to
sleep.”
He
huddled
down
in
his
cloak
and
plodded
off.

The
others
were
still
in
the
common
room
when
Jon
returned,
alone
but
for
Ghost.
“Where
have
you
been?”
Pyp
asked.

“Talking
with
Sam,”
he
said.

“He
truly
is
craven,”
said
Grenn.
“At
supper,
there
were
still
places
on
the
bench
when
he
got
his
pie,
but
he
was
too
scared
to
come
sit
with
us.”

“The
Lord
of
Ham
thinks
he’s
too
good
to
eat
with
the
likes
of
us,”
suggested
Jeren.

“I
saw
him
eat
a
pork
pie,”
Toad
said,
smirking.
“Do
you
think
it
was
a
brother?”
He
began
to
make
oinking
noises.

“Stop
it!”
Jon
snapped
angrily.

The
other
boys
fell
silent,
taken
aback
by
his
sudden
fury.
“Listen
to
me,”
Jon
said
into
the
quiet,
and
he
told
them
how
it
was
going
to
be.
Pyp
backed
him,
as
he’d
known
he
would,
but
when
Halder
spoke
up,
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise.
Grenn
was
anxious
at
the
first,
but
Jon
knew
the
words
to
move
him.
One
by
one
the
rest
fell
in
line.
Jon
persuaded
some,
cajoled
some,
shamed
the
others,
made
threats
where
threats
were
required.
At
the
end
they
had
all
agreed…
all
but
Rast.

“You
girls
do
as
you
please,”
Rast
said,
“but
if
Thorne
sends
me
against
Lady
Piggy,
I’m
going
to
slice
me
off
a
rasher
of
bacon.”
He
laughed
in
Jon’s
face
and
left
them
there.

Hours
later,
as
the
castle
slept,
three
of
them
paid
a
call
on
his
cell.
Grenn
held
his
arms
while
Pyp
sat
on
his
legs.
Jon
could
hear
Rast’s
rapid
breathing
as
Ghost
leapt
onto
his
chest.
The
direwolf’s
eyes
burned
red
as
embers
as
his
teeth
nipped
lightly
at
the
soft
skin
of
the
boy’s
throat,
just
enough
to
draw
blood.
“Remember,
we
know
where
you
sleep,”
Jon
said
softly.

The
next
morning
Jon
heard
Rast
tell
Albett
and
Toad
how
his
razor
had
slipped
while
he
shaved.

From
that
day
forth,
neither
Rast
nor
any
of
the
others
would
hurt
Samwell
Tarly.
When
Ser
Alliser
matched
them
against
him,
they
would
stand
their
ground
and
swat
aside
his
slow,
clumsy
strokes.
If
the
master-at-arms
screamed
for
an
attack,
they
would
dance
in
and
tap
Sam
lightly
on
breastplate
or
helm
or
leg.
Ser
Alliser
raged
and
threatened
and
called
them
all
cravens
and
women
and
worse,
yet
Sam
remained
unhurt.
A
few
nights
later,
at
Jon’s
urging,
he
joined
them
for
the
evening
meal,
taking
a
place
on
the
bench
beside
Halder.
It
was
another
fortnight
before
he
found
the
nerve
to
join
their
talk,
but
in
time
he
was
laughing
at
Pyp’s
faces
and
teasing
Grenn
with
the
best
of
them.

Fat
and
awkward
and
frightened
he
might
be,
but
Samwell
Tarly
was
no
fool.
One
night
he
visited
Jon
in
his
cell.
“I
don’t
know
what
you
did,”
he
said,
“but
I
know
you
did
it.”
He
looked
away
shyly.
“I’ve
never
had
a
friend
before.”

“We’re
not
friends,”
Jon
said.
He
put
a
hand
on
Sam’s
broad
shoulder.
“We’re
brothers.”

And
so
they
were,
he
thought
to
himself
after
Sam
had
taken
his
leave.
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon
were
his
father’s
sons,
and
he
loved
them
still,
yet
Jon
knew
that
he
had
never
truly
been
one
of
them.
Catelyn
Stark
had
seen
to
that.
The
grey
walls
of
Winterfell
might
still
haunt
his
dreams,
but
Castle
Black
was
his
life
now,
and
his
brothers
were
Sam
and
Grenn
and
Halder
and
Pyp
and
the
other
cast-outs
who
wore
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch.

“My
uncle
spoke
truly,”
he
whispered
to
Ghost.
He
wondered
if
he
would
ever
see
Benjen
Stark
again,
to
tell
him.

“It’s
the
hand’s
tourney
that’s
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble,
my
lords,”
the
commander
of
the
city
watch
complained
to
the
king’s
council.

“The
king’s
tourney,”
Ned
corrected,
wincing.
“I
assure
you,
the
Hand
wants
no
part
of
it.”

“Call
it
what
you
will,
my
lord.
Knights
have
been
arriving
from
all
over
the
realm,
and
for
every
knight
we
get
two
freeriders,
three
craftsmen,
six
men-at-arms,
a
dozen
merchants,
two
dozen
whores,
and
more
thieves
than
I
dare
guess.
This
cursed
heat
had
half
the
city
in
a
fever
to
start,
and
now
with
all
these
visitors…
last
night
we
had
a
drowning,
a
tavern
riot,
three
knife
fights,
a
rape,
two
fires,
robberies
beyond
count,
and
a
drunken
horse
race
down
the
Street
of
the
Sisters.
The
night
before
a
woman’s
head
was
found
in
the
Great
Sept,
floating
in
the
rainbow
pool.
No
one
seems
to
know
how
it
got
there
or
who
it
belongs
to.”

“How
dreadful,”
Varys
said
with
a
shudder.

Lord
Renly
Baratheon
was
less
sympathetic.
“If
you
cannot
keep
the
king’s
peace,
Janos,
perhaps
the
City
Watch
should
be
commanded
by
someone
who
can.”

Stout,
jowly
Janos
Slynt
puffed
himself
up
like
an
angry
frog,
his
bald
pate
reddening.
“Aegon
the
Dragon
himself
could
not
keep
the
peace,
Lord
Renly.
I
need
more
men.”

“How
many?”
Ned
asked,
leaning
forward.
As
ever,
Robert
had
not
troubled
himself
to
attend
the
council
session,
so
it
fell
to
his
Hand
to
speak
for
him.

“As
many
as
can
be
gotten,
Lord
Hand.”

“Hire
fifty
new
men,”
Ned
told
him.
“Lord
Baelish
will
see
that
you
get
the
coin.”

“I
will?”
Littlefinger
said.

“You
will.
You
found
forty
thousand
golden
dragons
for
a
champion’s
purse,
surely
you
can
scrape
together
a
few
coppers
to
keep
the
king’s
peace.”
Ned
turned
back
to
Janos
Slynt.
“I
will
also
give
you
twenty
good
swords
from
my
own
household
guard,
to
serve
with
the
Watch
until
the
crowds
have
left.”

“All
thanks,
Lord
Hand,”
Slynt
said,
bowing.
“I
promise
you,
they
shall
be
put
to
good
use.”

When
the
Commander
had
taken
his
leave,
Eddard
Stark
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
council.
“The
sooner
this
folly
is
done
with,
the
better
I
shall
like
it.”
As
if
the
expense
and
trouble
were
not
irksome
enough,
all
and
sundry
insisted
on
salting
Ned’s
wound
by
calling
it
“the
Hand’s
tourney,”
as
if
he
were
the
cause
of
it.
And
Robert
honestly
seemed
to
think
he
should
feel
honored!

“The
realm
prospers
from
such
events,
my
lord,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“They
bring
the
great
the
chance
of
glory,
and
the
lowly
a
respite
from
their
woes.”

“And
put
coins
in
many
a
pocket,”
Littlefinger
added.
“Every
inn
in
the
city
is
full,
and
the
whores
are
walking
bowlegged
and
jingling
with
each
step.”

Lord
Renly
laughed.
“We’re
fortunate
my
brother
Stannis
is
not
with
us.
Remember
the
time
he
proposed
to
outlaw
brothels?
The
king
asked
him
if
perhaps
he’d
like
to
outlaw
eating,
shitting,
and
breathing
while
he
was
at
it.

Littlefinger
had
been
more
use
at
court.
He
had
a
gift
for
finding
gold,
and
never
coughed.
“Lord
Orton
has
convinced
me.
Maester
Pycelle,
instruct
these
Lords
Declarant
that
no
harm
must
come
to
Petyr.
Elsewise,
the
crown
is
content
with
whatever
dispositions
they
might
make
for
the
governance
of
the
Vale
during
Robert
Arryn’s
minority.”

“Very
good,
Your
Grace.”

“Might
we
discuss
the
fleet?”
asked
Aurane
Waters.
“Fewer
than
a
dozen
of
our
ships
survived
the
inferno
on
the
Blackwater.
We
must
needs
restore
our
strength
at
sea.”

Merryweather
nodded.
“Strength
at
sea
is
most
essential.”

“Could
we
make
use
of
the
ironmen?”
asked
Orton
Merryweather.
“The
enemy
of
our
enemy?
What
would
the
Seastone
Chair
want
of
us
as
the
price
of
an
alliance?”

“They
want
the
north,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said,
“which
our
queen’s
noble
father
promised
to
House
Bolton.”

“How
inconvenient,”
said
Merryweather.
“Still,
the
north
is
large.
The
lands
could
be
divided.
It
need
not
be
a
permanent
arrangement.
Bolton
might
consent,
so
long
as
we
assure
him
that
our
strength
will
be
his
once
Stannis
is
destroyed.”

“Balon
Greyjoy
is
dead,
I
had
heard,”
said
Ser
Harys
Swyft.
“Do
we
know
who
rules
the
isles
now?
Did
Lord
Balon
have
a
son?”

“Leo?”
coughed
Lord
Gyles.
“Theo?”

“Theon
Greyjoy
was
raised
at
Winterfell,
a
ward
of
Eddard
Stark,”
Qyburn
said.
“He
is
not
like
to
be
a
friend
of
ours.”

“I
had
heard
he
was
slain,”
said
Merryweather.

“Was
there
only
one
son?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
tugged
upon
his
chin
beard.
“Brothers.
There
were
brothers.
Were
there
not?”

Varys
would
have
known,
Cersei
thought
with
irritation.
“I
do
not
propose
to
climb
in
bed
with
that
sorry
pack
of
squids.
Their
turn
will
come,
once
we
have
dealt
with
Stannis.
What
we
require
is
our
own
fleet.”

“I
propose
we
build
new
dromonds,”
said
Aurane
Waters.
“Ten,
to
start
with.”

“Where
is
the
coin
to
come
from?”
asked
Pycelle.

Lord
Gyles
took
that
as
an
invitation
to
begin
coughing
again.
He
brought
up
more
pink
spittle
and
dabbed
it
away
with
a
square
of
red
silk.
“There
is
no...”
he
managed,
before
the
coughing
ate
his
words.
“...no...
we
do
not...”

Ser
Harys
proved
swift
enough
at
least
to
grasp
the
meaning
between
the
coughs.
“The
crown
incomes
have
never
been
greater,”
he
objected.
“Ser
Kevan
told
me
so
himself.”

Lord
Gyles
coughed.
“...expenses...
gold
cloaks...”

Cersei
had
heard
his
objections
before.
“Our
lord
treasurer
is
trying
to
say
that
we
have
too
many
gold
cloaks
and
too
little
gold.”
Rosby’s
coughing
had
begun
to
vex
her.
Perhaps
Garth
the
Gross
would
not
have
been
so
ill.
“Though
large,
the
crown
incomes
are
not
large
enough
to
keep
abreast
of
Robert’s
debts.
Accordingly,
I
have
decided
to
defer
our
repayment
of
the
sums
owed
the
Holy
Faith
and
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos
until
war’s
end.”
The
new
High
Septon
would
doubtless
wring
his
holy
hands,
and
the
Braavosi
would
squeak
and
squawk
at
her,
but
what
of
it?
“The
monies
saved
will
be
used
for
the
building
of
our
new
fleet.”

“Your
Grace
is
prudent,”
said
Lord
Merryweather.
“This
is
a
wise
measure.
And
needed,
until
the
war
is
done.
I
concur.”

“And
I,”
said
Ser
Harys.

“Your
Grace,”
Pycelle
said
in
a
quavering
voice,
“this
will
cause
more
trouble
than
you
know,
I
fear.
The
Iron
Bank...”

“...remains
on
Braavos,
far
across
the
sea.
They
shall
have
their
gold,
maester.
A
Lannister
pays
his
debts.”

“The
Braavosi
have
a
saying
too.”
Pycelle’s
jeweled
chain
clinked
softly.
“The
Iron
Bank
will
have
its
due,
they
say.”

“The
Iron
Bank
will
have
its
due
when
I
say
they
will.
Until
such
time,
the
Iron
Bank
will
wait
respectfully.
Lord
Waters,
commence
the
building
of
your
dromonds.”

“Very
good,
Your
Grace.”

Ser
Harys
shuffled
through
some
papers.
“The
next
matter...
we
have
had
a
letter
from
Lord
Frey
putting
forth
some
claims...”

“How
many
lands
and
honors
does
that
man
want?”
snapped
the
queen.
“His
mother
must
have
had
three
teats.”

“My
lords
may
not
know,”
said
Qyburn,
“but
in
the
winesinks
and
pot
shops
of
this
city,
there
are
those
who
suggest
that
the
crown
might
have
been
somehow
complicit
in
Lord
Walder’s
crime.”

The
other
councillors
stared
at
him
uncertainly.
“Do
you
refer
to
the
Red
Wedding?”
asked
Aurane
Waters.
“Crime?”
said
Ser
Harys.
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat
noisily.
Lord
Gyles
coughed.

“These
sparrows
are
especially
outspoken,”
warned
Qyburn.
“The
Red
Wedding
was
an
affront
to
all
the
laws
of
gods
and
men,
they
say,
and
those
who
had
a
hand
in
it
are
damned.”

Cersei
was
not
slow
to
take
his
meaning.
“Lord
Walder
must
soon
face
the
Father’s
judgment.
He
is
very
old.
Let
the
sparrows
spit
upon
his
memory.
It
has
nought
to
do
with
us.”

“No,”
said
Ser
Harys.
“No,”
said
Lord
Merryweather.
“No
one
could
think
so,”
said
Pycelle.
Lord
Gyles
coughed.

“A
little
spittle
on
Lord
Walder’s
tomb
is
not
like
to
disturb
the
grave
worms,”
Qyburn
agreed,
“but
it
would
also
be
useful
if
someone
were
to
be
punished
for
the
Red
Wedding.
A
few
Frey
heads
would
do
much
to
mollify
the
north.”

“Lord
Walder
will
never
sacrifice
his
own,”
said
Pycelle.

“No,”
mused
Cersei,
“but
his
heirs
may
be
less
squeamish.
Lord
Walder
will
soon
do
us
the
courtesy
of
dying,
we
can
hope.
What
better
way
for
the
new
Lord
of
the
Crossing
to
rid
himself
of
inconvenient
half
brothers,
disagreeable
cousins,
and
scheming
sisters
than
by
naming
them
the
culprits?”

“Whilst
we
await
Lord
Walder’s
death,
there
is
another
matter,”
said
Aurane
Waters.
“The
Golden
Company
has
broken
its
contract
with
Myr.
Around
the
docks
I’ve
heard
men
say
that
Lord
Stannis
has
hired
them
and
is
bringing
them
across
the
sea.”

“What
would
he
pay
them
with?”
asked
Merryweather.
“Snow?
They
are
called
the
Golden
Company.
How
much
gold
does
Stannis
have?”

“Little
enough,”
Cersei
assured
him.
“Lord
Qyburn
has
spoken
to
the
crew
of
that
Myrish
galley
in
the
bay.
They
claim
the
Golden
Company
is
making
for
Volantis.
If
they
mean
to
cross
to
Westeros,
they
are
marching
in
the
wrong
direction.”

“Perhaps
they
grew
weary
of
fighting
on
the
losing
side,”
suggested
Lord
Merryweather.

“There
is
that
as
well,”
agreed
the
queen.
“Only
a
blind
man
could
fail
to
see
our
war
is
all
but
won.
Lord
Tyrell
has
Storm’s
End
invested.
Riverrun
is
besieged
by
the
Freys
and
my
cousin
Daven,
our
new
Warden
of
the
West.
Lord
Redwyne’s
ships
have
passed
through
the
Straits
of
Tarth
and
are
moving
swiftly
up
the
coast.
Only
a
few
fishing
boats
remain
on
Dragonstone
to
oppose
Redwyne’s
landing.
The
castle
may
hold
for
some
time,
but
once
we
have
the
port
we
can
cut
the
garrison
off
from
the
sea.
Then
only
Stannis
himself
will
remain
to
vex
us.”

“If
Lord
Janos
can
be
believed,
he
is
trying
to
make
common
cause
with
the
wildlings,”
warned
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.

“Savages
in
skins,”
declared
Lord
Merryweather.
“Lord
Stannis
must
be
desperate
indeed,
to
seek
such
allies.”

“Desperate
and
foolish,”
the
queen
agreed.
“The
northmen
hate
the
wildlings.
Roose
Bolton
should
have
no
trouble
winning
them
to
our
cause.
A
few
have
already
joined
up
with
his
bastard
son
to
help
him
clear
the
wretched
ironmen
from
Moat
Cailin
and
clear
the
way
for
Lord
Bolton
to
return.
Umber,
Ryswell...
I
forget
the
other
names.
Even
White
Harbor
is
on
the
point
of
joining
us.
Its
lord
has
agreed
to
marry
both
his
granddaughters
to
our
friends
of
Frey
and
open
his
port
to
our
ships.”

“I
thought
we
had
no
ships,”
Ser
Harys
said,
confused.

“Wyman
Manderly
was
a
loyal
bannerman
to
Eddard
Stark,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“Can
such
a
man
be
trusted?

No
one
can
be
trusted.
“He’s
a
fat
old
man,
and
frightened.
However,
he
is
proving
stubborn
on
one
point.
He
insists
that
he
will
not
bend
the
knee
until
his
heir
has
been
returned
to
him.”

“Do
we
have
this
heir?”
asked
Ser
Harys.

“He
will
be
at
Harrenhal,
if
he
is
still
alive.
Gregor
Clegane
took
him
captive.”
The
Mountain
had
not
always
been
gentle
with
his
prisoners,
even
those
worth
a
goodly
ransom.
“If
he
is
dead,
I
suppose
we
will
need
to
send
Lord
Manderly
the
heads
of
those
who
killed
him,
with
our
most
sincere
apologies.”
If
one
head
was
enough
to
appease
a
prince
of
Dorne,
a
bag
of
them
should
be
more
than
adequate
for
a
fat
northman
wrapped
in
sealskins.

“Will
not
Lord
Stannis
seek
to
win
the
allegiance
of
White
Harbor
as
well?”
asked
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.

“Oh,
he
has
tried.
Lord
Manderly
has
sent
his
letters
on
to
us
and
replied
with
evasions.
Stannis
demands
White
Harbor’s
swords
and
silver,
for
which
he
offers...
well,
nothing.”
One
day
she
must
light
a
candle
to
the
Stranger
for
carrying
Renly
off
and
leaving
Stannis.
If
it
had
been
the
other
way
around,
her
life
would
have
been
harder.
“Just
this
morning
there
was
another
bird.
Stannis
has
sent
his
onion
smuggler
to
treat
with
White
Harbor
on
his
behalf.
Manderly
has
clapped
the
wretch
inside
a
cell.
He
asks
us
what
he
should
do
with
him.”

“Send
him
here,
that
we
might
question
him,”
suggested
Lord
Merryweather.
“The
man
might
know
much
of
value.”

“Let
him
die,”
said
Qyburn.
“His
death
will
be
a
lesson
to
the
north,
to
show
them
what
becomes
of
traitors.”

“I
quite
agree,”
the
queen
said.
“I
have
instructed
Lord
Manderly
to
have
his
head
off
forthwith.
That
should
put
an
end
to
any
chance
of
White
Harbor
supporting
Stannis.”

“Stannis
will
need
another
Hand,”
observed
Aurane
Waters
with
a
chuckle.
“The
turnip
knight,
perhaps?”

“A
turnip
knight?”
said
Ser
Harys
Swyft,
confused.
“Who
is
this
man?
I
have
not
heard
of
him.”

Waters
did
not
reply,
except
to
roll
his
eyes.

“What
if
Lord
Manderly
should
refuse?”
asked
Merryweather.

“He
dare
not.
The
onion
knight’s
head
is
the
coin
he’ll
need
to
buy
his
son’s
life.”
Cersei
smiled.
“The
fat
old
fool
may
have
been
loyal
to
the
Starks
in
his
own
way,
but
with
the
wolves
of
Winterfell
extinguished—”

“Your
Grace
has
forgotten
the
Lady
Sansa,”
said
Pycelle.

The
queen
bristled.
“I
most
certainly
have
not
forgotten
that
little
she-wolf.”
She
refused
to
say
the
girl’s
name.
“I
ought
to
have
shown
her
to
the
black
cells
as
the
daughter
of
a
traitor,
but
instead
I
made
her
part
of
mine
own
household.
She
shared
my
hearth
and
hall,
played
with
my
own
children.
I
fed
her,
dressed
her,
tried
to
make
her
a
little
less
ignorant
about
the
world,
and
how
did
she
repay
me
for
my
kindness?
She
helped
murder
my
son.
When
we
find
the
Imp,
we
will
find
the
Lady
Sansa
too.
She
is
not
dead...
but
before
I
am
done
with
her,
I
promise
you,
she
will
be
singing
to
the
Stranger,
begging
for
his
kiss.”

An
awkward
silence
followed.
Have
they
all
swallowed
their
tongues?
Cersei
thought,
with
irritation.
It
was
enough
to
make
her
wonder
why
she
bothered
with
a
council.

“In
any
case,”
the
queen
went
on,
“Lord
Eddard’s
younger
daughter
is
with
Lord
Bolton,
and
will
be
wed
to
his
son
Ramsay
as
soon
as
Moat
Cailin
has
fallen.”
So
long
as
the
girl
played
her
role
well
enough
to
cement
their
claim
to
Winterfell,
neither
of
the
Boltons
would
much
care
that
she
was
actually
some
steward’s
whelp
tricked
up
by
Littlefinger.
“If
the
north
must
have
a
Stark,
we’ll
give
them
one.”
She
let
Lord
Merryweather
fill
her
cup
once
again.
“Another
problem
has
arisen
on
the
Wall,
however.
The
brothers
of
the
Night’s
Watch
have
taken
leave
of
their
wits
and
chosen
Ned
Stark’s
bastard
son
to
be
their
Lord
Commander.”

“Snow,
the
boy
is
called,”
Pycelle
said
unhelpfully.

“I
glimpsed
him
once
at
Winterfell,”
the
queen
said,
“though
the
Starks
did
their
best
to
hide
him.
He
looks
very
like
his
father.”
Her
husband’s
by-blows
had
his
look
as
well,
though
at
least
Robert
had
the
grace
to
keep
them
out
of
sight.
Once,
after
that
sorry
business
with
the
cat,
he
had
made
some
noises
about
bringing
some
baseborn
daughter
of
his
to
court.
“Do
as
you
please,”
she’d
told
him,
“but
you
may
find
that
the
city
is
not
a
healthy
place
for
a
growing
girl.”
The
bruise
those
words
had
won
her
had
been
hard
to
hide
from
Jaime,
but
they
heard
no
more
about
the
bastard
girl.
Catelyn
Tully
was
a
mouse,
or
she
would
have
smothered
this
Jon
Snow
in
his
cradle.
Instead,
she’s
left
the
filthy
task
to
me.
“Snow
shares
Lord
Eddard’s
taste
for
treason
too,”
she
said.
“The
father
would
have
handed
the
realm
to
Stannis.
The
son
has
given
him
lands
and
castles.”

“The
Night’s
Watch
is
sworn
to
take
no
part
in
the
wars
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
Pycelle
reminded
them.
“For
thousands
of
years
the
black
brothers
have
upheld
that
tradition.”

“Until
now,”
said
Cersei.
“The
bastard
boy
has
written
us
to
avow
that
the
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
side,
but
his
actions
give
the
lie
to
his
words.
He
has
given
Stannis
food
and
shelter,
yet
has
the
insolence
to
plead
with
us
for
arms
and
men.”

“An
outrage,”
declared
Lord
Merryweather.
“We
cannot
allow
the
Night’s
Watch
to
join
its
strength
to
that
of
Lord
Stannis.”

“We
must
declare
this
Snow
a
traitor
and
a
rebel,”
agreed
Ser
Harys
Swyft.
“The
black
brothers
must
remove
him.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
nodded
ponderously.
“I
propose
that
we
inform
Castle
Black
that
no
more
men
will
be
sent
to
them
until
such
time
as
Snow
is
gone.”

“Our
new
dromonds
will
need
oarsmen,”
said
Aurane
Waters.
“Let
us
instruct
the
lords
to
send
their
poachers
and
thieves
to
me
henceforth,
instead
of
to
the
Wall.”

Qyburn
leaned
forward
with
a
smile.
“The
Night’s
Watch
defends
us
all
from
snarks
and
grumkins.
My
lords,
I
say
that
we
must
help
the
brave
black
brothers.”

Cersei
gave
him
a
sharp
look.
“What
are
you
saying?”

“This,”
Qyburn
said.
“For
years
now,
the
Night’s
Watch
has
begged
for
men.
Lord
Stannis
has
answered
their
plea.
Can
King
Tommen
do
less?
His
Grace
should
send
the
Wall
a
hundred
men.
To
take
the
black,
ostensibly,
but
in
truth...”

“...to
remove
Jon
Snow
from
the
command,”
Cersei
finished,
delighted.
I
knew
I
was
right
to
want
him
on
my
council.
“That
is
just
what
we
shall
do.”
She
laughed.
If
this
bastard
boy
is
truly
his
father’s
son,
he
will
not
suspect
a
thing.
Perhaps
he
will
even
thank
me,
before
the
blade
slides
between
his
ribs.
“It
will
need
to
be
done
carefully,
to
be
sure.
Leave
the
rest
to
me,
my
lords.”
This
was
how
an
enemy
should
be
dealt
with:
with
a
dagger,
not
a
declaration.
“We
have
done
good
work
today,
my
lords.
I
thank
you.
Is
there
aught
else?”

“One
last
thing,
Your
Grace,”
said
Aurane
Waters,
in
an
apologetic
tone.
“I
hesitate
to
take
up
the
council’s
time
with
trifles,
but
there
has
been
some
queer
talk
heard
along
the
docks
of
late.
Sailors
from
the
east.
They
speak
of
dragons...”

“...and
manticores,
no
doubt,
and
bearded
snarks?”
Cersei
chuckled.
“Come
back
to
me
when
you
hear
talk
of
dwarfs,
my
lord.”
She
stood,
to
signal
that
the
meeting
was
at
an
end.

A
blustery
autumn
wind
was
blowing
when
Cersei
left
the
council
chambers,
and
bells
of
Blessed
Baelor
still
sang
their
song
of
mourning
off
across
the
city.
In
the
yard
twoscore
knights
were
hammering
each
other
with
sword
and
shield,
adding
to
the
din.
Ser
Boros
Blount
escorted
the
queen
back
to
her
apartments,
where
she
found
Lady
Merryweather
chuckling
with
Jocelyn
and
Dorcas.
“What
is
it
you
all
find
so
amusing?”

“The
Redwyne
twins,”
said
Taena.
“Both
of
them
have
fallen
in
love
with
Lady
Margaery.
They
used
to
fight
over
which
would
be
the
next
Lord
of
the
Arbor.
Now
both
of
them
want
to
join
the
Kingsguard,
just
to
be
near
the
little
queen.”

“The
Redwynes
have
always
had
more
freckles
than
wits.”
It
was
a
useful
thing
to
know,
though.
If
Horror
or
Slobber
were
to
be
found
abed
with
Margaery...
Cersei
wondered
if
the
little
queen
liked
freckles.
“Dorcas,
fetch
me
Ser
Osney
Kettleblack.”

Dorcas
blushed.
“As
you
command.”

When
the
girl
was
gone,
Taena
Merryweather
gave
the
queen
a
quizzical
look.
“Why
did
she
turn
so
red?”

“Love.”
It
was
Cersei’s
turn
to
laugh.
“She
fancies
our
Ser
Osney.”
He
was
the
youngest
Kettleblack,
the
clean-shaved
one.
Though
he
had
the
same
black
hair,
hooked
nose,
and
easy
smile
as
his
brother
Osmund,
one
cheek
bore
three
long
scratches,
courtesy
of
one
of
Tyrion’s
whores.
“She
likes
his
scars,
I
think.”

Lady
Merryweather’s
dark
eyes
shone
with
mischief.
“Just
so.
Scars
make
a
man
look
dangerous,
and
danger
is
exciting.”

“You
shock
me,
my
lady,”
the
queen
said,
teasing.
“If
danger
excites
you
so,
why
wed
Lord
Orton?
We
all
love
him,
it
is
true,
but
still...”
Petyr
had
once
remarked
that
the
horn
of
plenty
that
adorned
House
Merryweather’s
arms
suited
Lord
Orton
admirably,
since
he
had
carrot-colored
hair,
a
nose
as
bulbous
as
a
beetroot,
and
pease
porridge
for
wits.

Taena
laughed.
“My
lord
is
more
bountiful
than
dangerous,
this
is
so.
Yet...
I
hope
Your
Grace
will
not
think
the
less
of
me,
but
I
did
not
come
a
maid
entire
to
Orton’s
bed.”

You
are
all
whores
in
the
Free
Cities,
aren’t
you?
That
was
good
to
know;
one
day,
she
might
be
able
to
make
use
of
it.
“And
pray,
who
was
this
lover
who
was
so...
full
of
danger?”

Taena’s
olive
skin
turned
even
darker
as
she
blushed.
“Oh,
I
should
not
have
spoken.
Your
Grace
will
keep
my
secret,
yes?”

“Men
have
scars,
women
mysteries.”
Cersei
kissed
her
cheek.
I
will
have
his
name
out
of
you
soon
enough.

When
Dorcas
returned
with
Ser
Osney
Kettleblack,
the
queen
dismissed
her
ladies.
“Come
sit
with
me
by
the
window,
Ser
Osney.
Will
you
take
a
cup
of
wine?”
She
poured
for
them
herself.
“Your
cloak
is
threadbare.
I
have
a
mind
to
put
you
in
a
new
one.”

“What,
a
white
one?
Who’s
died?”

“No
one,
as
yet,”
the
queen
said.
“Is
that
your
wish,
to
join
your
brother
Osmund
in
our
Kingsguard?”

“I’d
rather
be
the
queen’s
guard,
if
it
please
Your
Grace.”
When
Osney
grinned,
the
scars
on
his
cheek
turned
bright
red.

Cersei’s
fingers
traced
their
path
across
his
cheek.
“You
have
a
bold
tongue,
ser.
You
will
make
me
forget
myself
again.”

“Good.”
Ser
Osney
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
her
fingers
roughly.
“My
sweet
queen.”

“You
are
a
wicked
man,”
the
queen
whispered,
“and
no
true
knight,
I
think.”
She
let
him
touch
her
breasts
through
the
silk
of
her
gown.
“Enough.”

“It
isn’t.
I
want
you.”

“You’ve
had
me.”

“Only
once.”
He
grabbed
her
left
breast
again
and
gave
it
a
clumsy
squeeze
that
reminded
her
of
Robert.

“One
good
night
for
one
good
knight.
You
did
me
valiant
service,
and
you
had
your
reward.”
Cersei
walked
her
fingers
up
his
laces.
She
could
feel
him
stiffening
through
his
breeches.
“Was
that
a
new
horse
you
were
riding
in
the
yard
yestermorn?”

“The
black
stallion?
Aye.
A
gift
from
my
brother
Osfryd.
Midnight,
I
call
him.”

How
wonderfully
original.
“A
fine
mount
for
a
battle.
For
pleasure,
though,
there
is
nothing
to
compare
to
a
gallop
on
a
spirited
young
filly.”
She
gave
him
a
smile
and
a
squeeze.
“Tell
me
true.
Do
you
think
our
little
queen
is
pretty?”

Ser
Osney
drew
back,
wary.
“I
suppose.
For
a
girl.
I’d
sooner
have
a
woman.”

“Why
not
both?”
she
whispered.
“Pluck
the
little
rose
for
me,
and
you
will
not
find
me
to
be
ungrateful.”

“The
little...
Margaery,
you
mean?”
Ser
Osney’s
ardor
was
wilting
in
his
breeches.
“She’s
the
king’s
wife.
Wasn’t
there
some
Kingsguard
who
lost
his
head
for
bedding
the
king’s
wife?”

“Ages
ago.”
She
was
his
king’s
mistress,
not
his
wife,
and
his
head
was
the
only
thing
he
did
not
lose.
Aegon
dismembered
him
piece
by
piece,
and
made
the
woman
watch.
Cersei
did
not
want
Osney
dwelling
on
that
ancient
unpleasantness,
however.
“Tommen
is
not
Aegon
the
Unworthy.
Have
no
fear,
he
will
do
as
I
bid
him.
I
mean
for
Margaery
to
lose
her
head,
not
you.”

That
gave
him
pause.
“Her
maidenhead,
you
mean?”

“That
too.
Assuming
she
has
still
one.”
She
traced
his
scars
again.
“Unless
you
think
Margaery
would
prove
unresponsive
to
your...
charms?”

Osney
gave
her
a
wounded
look.
“She
likes
me
well
enough.
Them
cousins
of
hers
are
always
teasing
with
me
about
my
nose.
How
big
it
is,
and
all.
The
last
time
Megga
did
that,
Margaery
told
them
to
stop
and
said
I
had
a
lovely
face.”

“There
you
are,
then.”

“There
I
am,”
the
man
agreed,
in
a
doubtful
tone,
“but
where
am
I
going
to
be
if
she...
if
I...
after
we...?”

“...do
the
deed?”
Cersei
gave
him
a
barbed
smile.
“Lying
with
a
queen
is
treason.
Tommen
would
have
no
choice
but
to
send
you
to
the
Wall.”

“The
Wall?”
he
said
with
dismay.

It
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
laugh.
No,
best
not.
Men
hate
being
laughed
at.
“A
black
cloak
would
go
well
with
your
eyes,
and
that
black
hair
of
yours.”

“No
one
returns
from
the
Wall.”

“You
will.
All
you
need
to
do
is
kill
a
boy.”

“What
boy?”

“A
bastard
boy
in
league
with
Stannis.
He’s
young
and
green,
and
you’ll
have
a
hundred
men.”

Kettleblack
was
afraid,
she
could
smell
it
on
him,
but
he
was
too
proud
to
own
up
to
that
fear.
Men
are
all
alike.
“I’ve
killed
more
boys
than
I
can
count,”
he
insisted.
“Once
this
boy
is
dead,
I’d
get
my
pardon
from
the
king?”

“That,
and
a
lordship.”
Unless
Snow’s
brothers
hang
you
first.
“A
queen
must
have
a
consort.
One
who
knows
no
fear.”

“Lord
Kettleblack?”
A
slow
smile
spread
across
his
face,
and
his
scars
flamed
red.
“Aye,
I
like
the
sound
o’
that.
A
lordly
lord...”

“...and
fit
to
bed
a
queen.”

He
frowned.
“The
Wall
is
cold.”

“And
I
am
warm.”
Cersei
put
her
arms
about
his
neck.
“Bed
a
girl
and
kill
a
boy
and
I
am
yours.
Do
you
have
the
courage?”

Osney
thought
a
moment
before
he
nodded.
“I
am
your
man.”

“You
are,
ser.”
She
kissed
him,
and
let
him
have
a
little
taste
of
tongue
before
she
broke
away.
“Enough
for
now.
The
rest
must
wait.
Will
you
dream
of
me
tonight?”

“Aye.”
His
voice
was
hoarse.

“And
when
you’re
abed
with
our
Maid
Margaery?”
she
asked
him,
teasing.
“When
you’re
in
her,
will
you
dream
of
me
then?”

“I
will,”
swore
Osney
Kettleblack.

“Good.”

After
he
was
gone,
Cersei
summoned
Jocelyn
to
brush
her
hair
out
whilst
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
and
stretched
like
a
cat.
I
was
made
for
this,
she
told
herself.
It
was
the
sheer
elegance
of
it
that
pleased
her
most.
Even
Mace
Tyrell
would
not
dare
defend
his
darling
daughter
if
she
was
caught
in
the
act
with
the
likes
of
Osney
Kettleblack,
and
neither
Stannis
Baratheon
nor
Jon
Snow
would
have
cause
to
wonder
why
Osney
was
being
sent
to
the
Wall.
She
would
see
to
it
that
Ser
Osmund
was
the
one
to
discover
his
brother
with
the
little
queen;
that
way
the
loyalty
of
the
other
two
Kettleblacks
need
not
be
impugned.
If
Father
could
only
see
me
now,
he
would
not
be
so
quick
to
speak
of
marrying
me
off
again.
A
pity
he’s
so
dead.
Him
and
Robert,
Jon
Arryn,
Ned
Stark,
Renly
Baratheon,
all
dead.
Only
Tyrion
remains,
and
not
for
long.

That
night
the
queen
summoned
Lady
Merryweather
to
her
bedchamber.
“Will
you
take
a
cup
of
wine?”
she
asked
her.

“A
small
one.”
The
Myrish
woman
laughed.
“A
big
one.”

“On
the
morrow
I
want
you
to
pay
a
call
on
my
good-daughter,”
Cersei
said
as
Dorcas
was
dressing
her
for
bed.

“Lady
Margaery
is
always
happy
to
see
me.”

“I
know.”
The
queen
did
not
fail
to
note
the
style
that
Taena
used
when
referring
to
Tommen’s
little
wife.
“Tell
her
I’ve
sent
seven
beeswax
candles
to
the
Baelor’s
Sept
in
memory
of
our
dear
High
Septon.”

Taena
laughed.
“If
so,
she
will
send
seven-and-seventy
candles
of
her
own,
so
as
not
to
be
outmourned.”

“I
will
be
very
cross
if
she
does
not,”
the
queen
said,
smiling.
“Tell
her
also
that
she
has
a
secret
admirer,
a
knight
so
smitten
with
her
beauty
that
he
cannot
sleep
at
night.”

“Might
I
ask
Your
Grace
which
knight?”
Mischief
sparkled
in
Taena’s
big
dark
eyes.
“Could
it
be
Ser
Osney?”

“It
could
be,”
the
queen
said,
“but
do
not
offer
up
that
name
freely.
Make
her
worm
it
out
of
you.
Will
you
do
that?”

“If
it
please
you.
That
is
all
I
wish,
Your
Grace.”

Outside
a
cold
wind
was
rising.
They
stayed
up
late
into
the
morning,
drinking
Arbor
gold
and
telling
one
another
tales.
Taena
got
quite
drunk
and
Cersei
pried
the
name
of
her
secret
lover
from
her.
He
was
a
Myrish
sea
captain,
half
a
pirate,
with
black
hair
to
the
shoulders
and
a
scar
that
ran
across
his
face
from
chin
to
ear.
“A
hundred
times
I
told
him
no,
and
he
said
yes,”
the
other
woman
told
her,
“until
finally
I
was
saying
yes
as
well.
He
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
be
denied.”

“I
know
the
sort,”
the
queen
said
with
a
wry
smile.

“Has
Your
Grace
ever
known
a
man
like
that,
I
wonder?”

“Robert,”
she
lied,
thinking
of
Jaime.

Yet
when
she
closed
her
eyes,
it
was
the
other
brother
that
she
dreamt
of,
and
the
three
wretched
fools
with
whom
she
had
begun
her
day.
In
the
dream
it
was
Tyrion’s
head
they
brought
her
in
their
sack.
She
had
it
bronzed,
and
kept
it
in
her
chamber
pot.
=======
I
ofttimes
wonder
how
Stannis
ever
got
that
ugly
daughter
of
his.
He
goes
to
his
marriage
bed
like
a
man
marching
to
a
battlefield,
with
a
grim
look
in
his
eyes
and
a
determination
to
do
his
duty.”

Ned
had
not
joined
the
laughter.
“I
wonder
about
your
brother
Stannis
as
well.
I
wonder
when
he
intends
to
end
his
visit
to
Dragonstone
and
resume
his
seat
on
this
council.”

“No
doubt
as
soon
as
we’ve
scourged
all
those
whores
into
the
sea,”
Littlefinger
replied,
provoking
more
laughter.

“I
have
heard
quite
enough
about
whores
for
one
day,”
Ned
said,
rising.
“Until
the
morrow.”

Harwin
had
the
door
when
Ned
returned
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“Summon
Jory
to
my
chambers
and
tell
your
father
to
saddle
my
horse,”
Ned
told
him,
too
brusquely.

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”

The
Red
Keep
and
the
“Hand’s
tourney”
were
chafing
him
raw,
Ned
reflected
as
he
climbed.
He
yearned
for
the
comfort
of
Catelyn’s
arms,
for
the
sounds
of
Robb
and
Jon
crossing
swords
in
the
practice
yard,
for
the
cool
days
and
cold
nights
of
the
north.

In
his
chambers
he
stripped
off
his
council
silks
and
sat
for
a
moment
with
the
book
while
he
waited
for
Jory
to
arrive.
The
Lineages
and
Histories
of
the
Great
Houses
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
With
Descliptions
of
Many
High
Lords
and
Noble
Ladies
and
Their
Children,
by
Grand
Maester
Malleon.
Pycelle
had
spoken
truly;
it
made
for
ponderous
reading.
Yet
Jon
Arryn
had
asked
for
it,
and
Ned
felt
certain
he
had
reasons.
There
was
something
here,
some
truth
buried
in
these
brittle
yellow
pages,
if
only
he
could
see
it.
But
what?
The
tome
was
over
a
century
old.
Scarcely
a
man
now
alive
had
yet
been
born
when
Malleon
had
compiled
his
dusty
lists
of
weddings,
births,
and
deaths.

He
opened
to
the
section
on
House
Lannister
once
more,
and
turned
the
pages
slowly,
hoping
against
hope
that
something
would
leap
out
at
him.
The
Lannisters
were
an
old
family,
tracing
their
descent
back
to
Lann
the
Clever,
a
trickster
from
the
Age
of
Heroes
who
was
no
doubt
as
legendary
as
Bran
the
Builder,
though
far
more
beloved
of
singers
and
taletellers.
In
the
songs,
Lann
was
the
fellow
who
winkled
the
Casterlys
out
of
Casterly
Rock
with
no
weapon
but
his
wits,
and
stole
gold
from
the
sun
to
brighten
his
curly
hair.
Ned
wished
he
were
here
now,
to
winkle
the
truth
out
of
this
damnable
book.

A
sharp
rap
on
the
door
heralded
Jory
Cassel.
Ned
closed
Malleon’s
tome
and
bid
him
enter.
“I’ve
promised
the
City
Watch
twenty
of
my
guard
until
the
tourney
is
done,”
he
told
him.
“I
rely
on
you
to
make
the
choice.
Give
Alyn
the
command,
and
make
certain
the
men
understand
that
they
are
needed
to
stop
fights,
not
start
them.”
Rising,
Ned
opened
a
cedar
chest
and
removed
a
light
linen
undertunic.
“Did
you
find
the
stableboy?”

“The
watchman,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.
“He
vows
he’ll
never
touch
another
horse.”

“What
did
he
have
to
say?”

“He
claims
he
knew
Lord
Arryn
well.
Fast
friends,
they
were.”
Jory
snorted.
“The
Hand
always
gave
the
lads
a
copper
on
their
name
days,
he
says.
Had
a
way
with
horses.
Never
rode
his
mounts
too
hard,
and
brought
them
carrots
and
apples,
so
they
were
always
pleased
to
see
him.”

“Carrots
and
apples,”
Ned
repeated.
It
sounded
as
if
this
boy
would
be
even
less
use
than
the
others.
And
he
was
the
last
of
the
four
Littlefinger
had
turned
up.
Jory
had
spoken
to
each
of
them
in
turn.
Ser
Hugh
had
been
brusque
and
uninformative,
and
arrogant
as
only
a
new-made
knight
can
be.
If
the
Hand
wished
to
talk
to
him,
he
should
be
pleased
to
receive
him,
but
he
would
not
be
questioned
by
a
mere
captain
of
guards…
even
if
said
captain
was
ten
years
older
and
a
hundred
times
the
swordsman.
The
serving
girl
had
at
least
been
pleasant.
She
said
Lord
Jon
had
been
reading
more
than
was
good
for
him,
that
he
was
troubled
and
melancholy
over
his
young
son’s
frailty,
and
gruff
with
his
lady
wife.
The
potboy,
now
cordwainer,
had
never
exchanged
so
much
as
a
word
with
Lord
Jon,
but
he
was
full
of
oddments
of
kitchen
gossip:
the
lord
had
been
quarreling
with
the
king,
the
lord
only
picked
at
his
food,
the
lord
was
sending
his
boy
to
be
fostered
on
Dragonstone,
the
lord
had
taken
a
great
interest
in
the
breeding
of
hunting
hounds,
the
lord
had
visited
a
master
armorer
to
commission
a
new
suit
of
plate,
wrought
all
in
pale
silver
with
a
blue
jasper
falcon
and
a
mother-of-pearl
moon
on
the
breast.
The
king’s
own
brother
had
gone
with
him
to
help
choose
the
design,
the
potboy
said.
No,
not
Lord
Renly,
the
other
one,
Lord
Stannis.

“Did
our
watchman
recall
anything
else
of
note?”

“The
lad
swears
Lord
Jon
was
as
strong
as
a
man
half
his
age.
Often
went
riding
with
Lord
Stannis,
he
says.”

Stannis
again,
Ned
thought.
He
found
that
curious.
Jon
Arryn
and
he
had
been
cordial,
but
never
friendly.
And
while
Robert
had
been
riding
north
to
Winterfell,
Stannis
had
removed
himself
to
Dragonstone,
the
Targaryen
island
fastness
he
had
conquered
in
his
brother’s
name.
He
had
given
no
word
as
to
when
he
might
return.
“Where
did
they
go
on
these
rides?”
Ned
asked.

“The
boy
says
that
they
visited
a
brothel.”

“A
brothel?”
Ned
said.
“The
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Hand
of
the
King
visited
a
brothel
with
Stannis
Baratheon?”
He
shook
his
head,
incredulous,
wondering
what
Lord
Renly
would
make
of
this
tidbit.
Robert’s
lusts
were
the
subject
of
ribald
drinking
songs
throughout
the
realm,
but
Stannis
was
a
different
sort
of
man;
a
bare
year
younger
than
the
king,
yet
utterly
unlike
him,
stern,
humorless,
unforgiving,
grim
in
his
sense
of
duty.

“The
boy
insists
it’s
true.
The
Hand
took
three
guardsmen
with
him,
and
the
boy
says
they
were
joking
of
it
when
he
took
their
horses
afterward.”

“Which
brothel?”
Ned
asked.

“The
boy
did
not
know.
The
guards
would.”

“A
pity
Lysa
carried
them
off
to
the
Vale,”
Ned
said
dryly.
“The
gods
are
doing
their
best
to
vex
us.
Lady
Lysa,
Maester
Colemon,
Lord
Stannis…
everyone
who
might
actually
know
the
truth
of
what
happened
to
Jon
Arryn
is
a
thousand
leagues
away.”

“Will
you
summon
Lord
Stannis
back
from
Dragonstone?”

“Not
yet,”
Ned
said.
“Not
until
I
have
a
better
notion
of
what
this
is
all
about
and
where
he
stands.”
The
matter
nagged
at
him.
Why
did
Stannis
leave?
Had
he
played
some
part
in
Jon
Arryn’s
murder?
Or
was
he
afraid?
Ned
found
it
hard
to
imagine
what
could
frighten
Stannis
Baratheon,
who
had
once
held
Storm’s
End
through
a
year
of
siege,
surviving
on
rats
and
boot
leather
while
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
sat
outside
with
their
hosts,
banqueting
in
sight
of
his
walls.

“Bring
me
my
doublet,
if
you
would.
The
grey,
with
the
direwolf
sigil.
I
want
this
armorer
to
know
who
I
am.
It
might
make
him
more
forthcoming.”

Jory
went
to
the
wardrobe.
“Lord
Renly
is
brother
to
Lord
Stannis
as
well
as
the
king.”

“Yet
it
seems
that
he
was
not
invited
on
these
rides.”
Ned
was
not
sure
what
to
make
of
Renly,
with
all
his
friendly
ways
and
easy
smiles.
A
few
days
past,
he
had
taken
Ned
aside
to
show
him
an
exquisite
rose
gold
locklet.
Inside
was
a
miniature
painted
in
the
vivid
Myrish
style,
of
a
lovely
young
girl
with
doe’s
eyes
and
a
cascade
of
soft
brown
hair.
Renly
had
seemed
anxious
to
know
if
the
girl
reminded
him
of
anyone,
and
when
Ned
had
no
answer
but
a
shrug,
he
had
seemed
disappointed.
The
maid
was
Loras
Tyrell’s
sister
Margaery,
he’d
confessed,
but
there
were
those
who
said
she
looked
like
Lyanna.
“No,”
Ned
had
told
him,
bemused.
Could
it
be
that
Lord
Renly,
who
looked
so
like
a
young
Robert,
had
conceived
a
passion
for
a
girl
he
fancied
to
be
a
young
Lyanna?
That
struck
him
as
more
than
passing
queer.

Jory
held
out
the
doublet,
and
Ned
slid
his
hands
through
the
armholes.
“Perhaps
Lord
Stannis
will
return
for
Robert’s
tourney,”
he
said
as
Jory
laced
the
garment
up
the
back.

“That
would
be
a
stroke
of
fortune,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.

Ned
buckled
on
a
longsword.
“In
other
words,
not
bloody
likely.”
His
smile
was
grim.

Jory
draped
Ned’s
cloak
across
his
shoulders
and
clasped
it
at
the
throat
with
the
Hand’s
badge
of
office.
“The
armorer
lives
above
his
shop,
in
a
large
house
at
the
top
of
the
Street
of
Steel.
Alyn
knows
the
way,
my
lord.”

Ned
nodded.
“The
gods
help
this
potboy
if
he’s
sent
me
off
haring
after
shadows.”
It
was
a
slim
enough
staff
to
lean
on,
but
the
Jon
Arryn
that
Ned
Stark
had
known
was
not
one
to
wear
jeweled
and
silvered
plate.
Steel
was
steel;
it
was
meant
for
protection,
not
ornament.
He
might
have
changed
his
views,
to
be
sure.
He
would
scarcely
have
been
the
first
man
who
came
to
look
on
things
differently
after
a
few
years
at
court…
but
the
change
was
marked
enough
to
make
Ned
wonder.

“Is
there
any
other
service
I
might
perform?”

“I
suppose
you’d
best
begin
visiting
whorehouses.”

“Hard
duty,
my
lord.”
Jory
grinned.
“The
men
will
be
glad
to
help.
Porther
has
made
a
fair
start
already.”

Ned’s
favorite
horse
was
saddled
and
waiting
in
the
yard.
Varly
and
Jacks
fell
in
beside
him
as
he
rode
through
the
yard.
Their
steel
caps
and
shirts
of
mail
must
have
been
sweltering,
yet
they
said
no
word
of
complaint.
As
Lord
Eddard
passed
beneath
the
King’s
Gate
into
the
stink
of
the
city,
his
grey
and
white
cloak
streaming
from
his
shoulders,
he
saw
eyes
everywhere
and
kicked
his
mount
into
a
trot.
His
guard
followed.

He
looked
behind
him
frequently
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
crowded
city
streets.
Tomard
and
Desmond
had
left
the
castle
early
this
morning
to
take
up
positions
on
the
route
they
must
take,
and
watch
for
anyone
following
them,
but
even
so,
Ned
was
uncertain.
The
shadow
of
the
King’s
Spider
and
his
little
birds
had
him
fretting
like
a
maiden
on
her
wedding
night.

The
Street
of
Steel
began
at
the
market
square
beside
the
River
Gate,
as
it
was
named
on
maps,
or
the
Mud
Gate,
as
it
was
commonly
called.
A
mummer
on
stilts
was
striding
through
the
throngs
like
some
great
insect,
with
a
horde
of
barefoot
children
trailing
behind
him,
hooting.
Elsewhere,
two
ragged
boys
no
older
than
Bran
were
dueling
with
sticks,
to
the
loud
encouragement
of
some
and
the
furious
curses
of
others.
An
old
woman
ended
the
contest
by
leaning
out
of
her
window
and
emptying
a
bucket
of
slops
on
the
heads
of
the
combatants.
In
the
shadow
of
the
wall,
farmers
stood
beside
their
wagons,
bellowing
out,
“Apples,
the
best
apples,
cheap
at
twice
the
price,”
and
“Blood
melons,
sweet
as
honey,”
and
“Turnips,
onions,
roots,
here
you
go
here,
here
you
go,
turnips,
onions,
roots,
here
you
go
here.”

The
Mud
Gate
was
open,
and
a
squad
of
City
Watchmen
stood
under
the
portcullis
in
their
golden
cloaks,
leaning
on
spears.
When
a
column
of
riders
appeared
from
the
west,
the
guardsmen
sprang
into
action,
shouting
commands
and
moving
the
carts
and
foot
traffic
aside
to
let
the
knight
enter
with
his
escort.
The
first
rider
through
the
gate
carried
a
long
black
banner.
The
silk
rippled
in
the
wind
like
a
living
thing;
across
the
fabric
was
blazoned
a
night
sky
slashed
with
purple
lightning.
“Make
way
for
Lord
Beric!”
the
rider
shouted.
“Make
way
for
Lord
Beric!”
And
close
behind
came
the
young
lord
himself,
a
dashing
figure
on
a
black
courser,
with
red-gold
hair
and
a
black
satin
cloak
dusted
with
stars.
“Here
to
fight
in
the
Hand’s
tourney,
my
lord?”
a
guardsman
called
out
to
him.
“Here
to
win
the
Hand’s
tourney,”
Lord
Beric
shouted
back
as
the
crowd
cheered.

Ned
turned
off
the
square
where
the
Street
of
Steel
began
and
followed
its
winding
path
up
a
long
hill,
past
blacksmiths
working
at
open
forges,
freeriders
haggling
over
mail
shirts,
and
grizzled
ironmongers
selling
old
blades
and
razors
from
their
wagons.
The
farther
they
climbed,
the
larger
the
buildings
grew.
The
man
they
wanted
was
all
the
way
at
the
top
of
the
hill,
in
a
huge
house
of
timber
and
plaster
whose
upper
stories
loomed
over
the
narrow
street.
The
double
doors
showed
a
hunting
scene
carved
in
ebony
and
weirwood.
A
pair
of
stone
knights
stood
sentry
at
the
entrance,
armored
in
fanciful
suits
of
polished
red
steel
that
transformed
them
into
griffin
and
unicorn.
Ned
left
his
horse
with
Jacks
and
shouldered
his
way
inside.

The
slim
young
serving
girl
took
quick
note
of
Ned’s
badge
and
the
sigil
on
his
doublet,
and
the
master
came
hurrying
out,
all
smiles
and
bows.
“Wine
for
the
King’s
Hand,”
he
told
the
girl,
gesturing
Ned
to
a
couch.
“I
am
Tobho
Mott,
my
lord,
please,
please,
put
yourself
at
ease.”
He
wore
a
black
velvet
coat
with
hammers
embroidered
on
the
sleeves
in
silver
thread,
Around
his
neck
was
a
heavy
silver
chain
and
a
sapphire
as
large
as
a
pigeon’s
egg.
“If
you
are
in
need
of
new
arms
for
the
Hand’s
tourney,
you
have
come
to
the
right
shop.”
Ned
did
not
bother
to
correct
him.
“My
work
is
costly,
and
I
make
no
apologies
for
that,
my
lord,”
he
said
as
he
filled
two
matching
silver
goblets.
“You
will
not
find
craftsmanship
equal
to
mine
anywhere
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
I
promise
you.
Visit
every
forge
in
King’s
Landing
if
you
like,
and
compare
for
yourself.
Any
village
smith
can
hammer
out
a
shirt
of
mail;
my
work
is
art.”

Ned
sipped
his
wine
and
let
the
man
go
on.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
bought
all
his
armor
here,
Tobho
boasted,
and
many
high
lords,
the
ones
who
knew
fine
steel,
and
even
Lord
Renly,
the
king’s
own
brother.
Perhaps
the
Hand
had
seen
Lord
Renly’s
new
armor,
the
green
plate
with
the
golden
antlers?
No
other
armorer
in
the
city
could
get
that
deep
a
green;
he
knew
the
secret
of
putting
color
in
the
steel
itself,
paint
and
enamel
were
the
crutches
of
a
journeyman.
Or
mayhaps
the
Hand
wanted
a
blade?
Tobho
had
learned
to
work
Valyrian
steel
at
the
forges
of
Qohor
as
a
boy.
Only
a
man
who
knew
the
spells
could
take
old
weapons
and
forge
them
anew.
“The
direwolf
is
the
sigil
of
House
Stark,
is
it
not?
I
could
fashion
a
direwolf
helm
so
real
that
children
will
run
from
you
in
the
street,”
he
vowed.

Ned
smiled.
“Did
you
make
a
falcon
helm
for
Lord
Arryn?”

Tobho
Mott
paused
a
long
moment
and
set
aside
his
wine.
“The
Hand
did
call
upon
me,
with
Lord
Stannis,
the
king’s
brother.
I
regret
to
say,
they
did
not
honor
me
with
their
patronage.”

Ned
looked
at
the
man
evenly,
saying
nothing,
waiting.
He
had
found
over
the
years
that
silence
sometimes
yielded
more
than
questions.
And
so
it
was
this
time.

“They
asked
to
see
the
boy,”
the
armorer
said,
“so
I
took
them
back
to
the
forge.”

“The
boy,”
Ned
echoed.
He
had
no
notion
who
the
boy
might
be.
“I
should
like
to
see
the
boy
as
well.”

Tobho
Mott
gave
him
a
cool,
careful
look.
“As
you
wish,
my
lord,”
he
said
with
no
trace
of
his
former
friendliness.
He
led
Ned
out
a
rear
door
and
across
a
narrow
yard,
back
to
the
cavernous
stone
barn
where
the
work
was
done.
When
the
armorer
opened
the
door,
the
blast
of
hot
air
that
came
through
made
Ned
feel
as
though
he
were
walking
into
a
dragon’s
mouth.
Inside,
a
forge
blazed
in
each
corner,
and
the
air
stank
of
smoke
and
sulfur.
Journeymen
armorers
glanced
up
from
their
hammers
and
tongs
just
long
enough
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
their
brows,
while
bare-chested
apprentice
boys
worked
the
bellows.

The
master
called
over
a
tall
lad
about
Robb’s
age,
his
arms
and
chest
corded
with
muscle.
“This
is
Lord
Stark,
the
new
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
told
him
as
the
boy
looked
at
Ned
through
sullen
blue
eyes
and
pushed
back
sweat-soaked
hair
with
his
fingers.
Thick
hair,
shaggy
and
unkempt
and
black
as
ink.
The
shadow
of
a
new
beard
darkened
his
jaw.
“This
is
Gendry.
Strong
for
his
age,
and
he
works
hard.
Show
the
Hand
that
helmet
you
made,
lad.”
Almost
shyly,
the
boy
led
them
to
his
bench,
and
a
steel
helm
shaped
like
a
bull’s
head,
with
two
great
curving
horns.

Ned
turned
the
helm
over
in
his
hands.
It
was
raw
steel,
unpolished
but
expertly
shaped.
“This
is
fine
work.
I
would
be
pleased
if
you
would
let
me
buy
it.”

The
boy
snatched
it
out
of
his
hands.
“It’s
not
for
sale.”

Tobho
Mott
looked
horror-struck.
“Boy,
this
is
the
King’s
Hand.
If
his
lordship
wants
this
helm,
make
him
a
gift
of
it.
He
honors
you
by
asking.”

“I
made
it
for
me,”
the
boy
said
stubbornly.

“A
hundred
pardons,
my
lord,”
his
master
said
hurriedly
to
Ned.
“The
boy
is
crude
as
new
steel,
and
like
new
steel
would
profit
from
some
beating.
That
helm
is
journeyman’s
work
at
best.
Forgive
him
and
I
promise
I
will
craft
you
a
helm
like
none
you
have
ever
seen.”

“He’s
done
nothing
that
requires
my
forgiveness.
Gendry,
when
Lord
Arryn
came
to
see
you,
what
did
you
talk
about?”

“He
asked
me
questions
is
all,
m’lord.”

“What
sort
of
questions?”

The
boy
shrugged.
“How
was
I,
and
was
I
well
treated,
and
if
I
liked
the
work,
and
stuff
about
my
mother.
Who
she
was
and
what
she
looked
like
and
all.”

“What
did
you
tell
him?”
Ned
asked.

The
boy
shoved
a
fresh
fall
of
black
hair
off
his
forehead.
“She
died
when
I
was
little.
She
had
yellow
hair,
and
sometimes
she
used
to
sing
to
me,
I
remember.
She
worked
in
an
alehouse.”

“Did
Lord
Stannis
question
you
as
well?”

“The
bald
one?
No,
not
him.
He
never
said
no
word,
just
glared
at
me,
like
I
was
some
raper
who
done
for
his
daughter.”

“Mind
your
filthy
tongue,”
the
master
said.
“This
is
the
King’s
own
Hand.”
The
boy
lowered
his
eyes.
“A
smart
boy,
but
stubborn.
That
helm…
the
others
call
him
bullheaded,
so
he
threw
it
in
their
teeth.”

Ned
touched
the
boy’s
head,
fingering
the
thick
black
hair.
“Look
at
me,
Gendry.”
The
apprentice
lifted
his
face.
Ned
studied
the
shape
of
his
jaw,
the
eyes
like
blue
ice.
Yes,
he
thought,
I
see
it.
“Go
back
to
your
work,
lad.
I’m
sorry
to
have
bothered
you.”
He
walked
back
to
the
house
with
the
master.
“Who
paid
the
boy’s
apprentice
fee?”
he
asked
lightly.

Mott
looked
fretful.
“You
saw
the
boy.
Such
a
strong
boy.
Those
hands
of
his,
those
hands
were
made
for
hammers.
He
had
such
promise,
I
took
him
on
without
a
fee.”

“The
truth
now,”
Ned
urged.
“The
streets
are
full
of
strong
boys.
The
day
you
take
on
an
apprentice
without
a
fee
will
be
the
day
the
Wall
comes
down.
Who
paid
for
him?”

“A
lord,”
the
master
said
reluctantly.
“He
gave
no
name,
and
wore
no
sigil
on
his
coat.
He
paid
in
gold,
twice
the
customary
sum,
and
said
he
was
paying
once
for
the
boy,
and
once
for
my
silence.”

“Describe
him.”

“He
was
stout,
round
of
shoulder,
not
so
tall
as
you.
Brown
beard,
but
there
was
a
bit
of
red
in
it,
I’ll
swear.
He
wore
a
rich
cloak,
that
I
do
remember,
heavy
purple
velvet
worked
with
silver
threads,
but
the
hood
shadowed
his
face
and
I
never
did
see
him
clear.”
He
hesitated
a
moment.
“My
lord,
I
want
no
trouble.”

“None
of
us
wants
trouble,
but
I
fear
these
are
troubled
times,
Master
Mott,”
Ned
said.
“You
know
who
the
boy
is.”

“I
am
only
an
armorer,
my
lord.
I
know
what
I’m
told.”

“You
know
who
the
boy
is,”
Ned
repeated
patiently.
“That
is
not
a
question.”

“The
boy
is
my
apprentice,”
the
master
said.
He
looked
Ned
in
the
eye,
stubborn
as
old
iron.
“Who
he
was
before
he
came
to
me,
that’s
none
of
my
concern.”

Ned
nodded.
He
decided
that
he
liked
Tobho
Mott,
master
armorer.
“If
the
day
ever
comes
when
Gendry
would
rather
wield
a
sword
than
forge
one,
send
him
to
me.
He
has
the
look
of
a
warrior.
Until
then,
you
have
my
thanks,
Master
Mott,
and
my
promise.
Should
I
ever
want
a
helm
to
frighten
children,
this
will
be
the
first
place
I
visit.”

His
guard
was
waiting
outside
with
the
horses.
“Did
you
find
anything,
my
lord?”
Jacks
asked
as
Ned
mounted
up.

“I
did,”
Ned
told
him,
wondering.
What
had
Jon
Arryn
wanted
with
a
king’s
bastard,
and
why
was
it
worth
his
life?

THE
IRON
CAPTAIN

The
wind
was
blowing
from
the
north
as
the
Iron
Victory
came
round
the
point
and
entered
the
holy
bay
called
Nagga’s
Cradle.

Victarion
joined
Nute
the
Barber
at
her
prow.
Ahead
loomed
the
sacred
shore
of
Old
Wyk
and
the
grassy
hill
above
it,
where
the
ribs
of
Nagga
rose
from
the
earth
like
the
trunks
of
great
white
trees,
as
wide
around
as
a
dromond’s
mast
and
twice
as
tall.

The
bones
of
the
Grey
King’s
Hall.
Victarion
could
feel
the
magic
of
this
place.
“Balon
stood
beneath
those
bones,
when
first
he
named
himself
a
king,”
he
recalled.
“He
swore
to
win
us
back
our
freedoms,
and
Tarle
the
Thrice-Drowned
placed
a
driftwood
crown
upon
his
head.
‘BALON!’
they
cried.
‘BALON!
BALON
KING!’”

“They
will
shout
your
name
as
loud,”
said
Nute.

Victarion
nodded,
though
he
did
not
share
the
Barber’s
certainty.
Balon
had
three
sons,
and
a
daughter
he
loved
well.

He
had
said
as
much
to
his
captains
at
Moat
Cailin,
when
first
they
urged
him
to
claim
the
Seastone
Chair.
“Balon’s
sons
are
dead,”
Red
Ralf
Stonehouse
had
argued,
“and
Asha
is
a
woman.
You
were
your
brother’s
strong
right
arm,
you
must
pick
up
the
sword
that
he
let
fall.”
When
Victarion
reminded
them
that
Balon
had
commanded
him
to
hold
the
Moat
against
the
northmen,
Ralf
Kenning
said,
“The
wolves
are
broken,
lord.
What
good
to
win
this
swamp
and
lose
the
isles?”
And
Ralf
the
Limper
added,
“The
Crow’s
Eye
has
been
too
long
away.
He
knows
us
not.”

Euron
Greyjoy,
King
of
the
Isles
and
the
North.
The
thought
woke
an
old
rage
in
his
heart,
but
still...

“Words
are
wind,”
Victarion
told
them,
“and
the
only
good
wind
is
that
which
fills
our
sails.
Would
you
have
me
fight
the
Crow’s
Eye?
Brother
against
brother,
ironborn
against
ironborn?”
Euron
was
still
his
elder,
no
matter
how
much
bad
blood
might
be
between
them.
No
man
is
as
accursed
as
the
kinslayer.

But
when
the
Damphair’s
summons
came,
the
call
to
kingsmoot,
then
all
was
changed.
Aeron
speaks
with
the
Drowned
God’s
voice,
Victarion
reminded
himself,
and
if
the
Drowned
God
wills
that
I
should
sit
the
Seastone
Chair...
The
next
day
he
gave
command
of
Moat
Cailin
to
Ralf
Kenning
and
set
off
overland
for
the
Fever
River
where
the
Iron
Fleet
lay
amongst
the
reeds
and
willows.
Rough
seas
and
fickle
winds
had
delayed
him,
but
only
one
ship
had
been
lost,
and
he
was
home.

Grief
and
Iron
Vengeance
were
close
behind
as
Iron
Victory
passed
the
headland.
Behind
came
Hardhand,
Iron
Wind,
Grey
Ghost,
Lord
Quellon,
Lord
Vickon,
Lord
Dagon,
and
the
rest,
nine-tenths
of
the
Iron
Fleet,
sailing
on
the
evening
tide
in
a
ragged
column
that
extended
back
long
leagues.
The
sight
of
their
sails
filled
Victarion
Greyjoy
with
content.
No
man
had
ever
loved
his
wives
half
as
well
as
the
Lord
Captain
loved
his
ships.

Along
the
sacred
strand
of
Old
Wyk,
longships
lined
the
shore
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see,
their
masts
thrust
up
like
spears.
In
the
deeper
waters
rode
prizes:
cogs,
carracks,
and
dromonds
won
in
raid
or
war,
too
big
to
run
ashore.
From
prow
and
stern
and
mast
flew
familiar
banners.

Nute
the
Barber
squinted
toward
the
strand.
“Is
that
Lord
Harlaw’s
Sea
Song?”
The
Barber
was
a
thickset
man
with
bandy
legs
and
long
arms,
but
his
eyes
were
not
so
keen
as
they
had
been
when
he
was
young.
In
those
days
he
could
throw
an
axe
so
well
that
men
said
he
could
shave
you
with
it.

“Sea
Song,
aye.”
Rodrik
the
Reader
had
left
his
books,
it
would
seem.
“And
there’s
old
Drumm’s
Thunderer,
with
Blacktyde’s
Nightflyer
beside
her.”
Victarion’s
eyes
were
as
sharp
as
they
had
ever
been.
Even
with
their
sails
furled
and
their
banners
hanging
limp,
he
knew
them,
as
befit
the
Lord
Captain
of
the
Iron
Fleet.
“Silverfin
too.
Some
kin
of
Sawane
Botley.”
The
Crow’s
Eye
had
drowned
Lord
Botley,
Victarion
had
heard,
and
his
heir
had
died
at
Moat
Cailin,
but
there
had
been
brothers,
and
other
sons
as
well.
How
many?
Four?
No,
five,
and
none
with
any
cause
to
love
the
Crow’s
Eye.

And
then
he
saw
her:
a
single-masted
galley,
lean
and
low,
with
a
dark
red
hull.
Her
sails,
now
furled,
were
black
as
a
starless
sky.
Even
at
anchor
Silence
looked
both
cruel
and
fast.
On
her
prow
was
a
black
iron
maiden
with
one
arm
outstretched.
Her
waist
was
slender,
her
breasts
high
and
proud,
her
legs
long
and
shapely.
A
windblown
mane
of
black
iron
hair
streamed
from
her
head,
and
her
eyes
were
mother-of-pearl,
but
she
had
no
mouth.

Victarion’s
hands
closed
into
fists.
He
had
beaten
four
men
to
death
with
those
hands,
and
one
wife
as
well.
Though
his
hair
was
flecked
with
hoarfrost,
he
was
as
strong
as
he
had
ever
been,
with
a
bull’s
broad
chest
and
a
boy’s
flat
belly.
The
kinslayer
is
accursed
in
the
eyes
of
gods
and
men,
Balon
had
reminded
him
on
the
day
he
sent
the
Crow’s
Eye
off
to
sea.

“He
is
here,”
Victarion
told
the
Barber.
“Drop
sail.
We
proceed
on
oars
alone.
Command
Grief
and
Iron
Vengeance
to
stand
between
Silence
and
the
sea.
The
rest
of
the
fleet
to
seal
the
bay.
None
is
to
leave
save
at
my
command,
neither
man
nor
crow.”

The
men
upon
the
shore
had
spied
their
sails.
Shouts
echoed
across
the
bay
as
friends
and
kin
called
out
greetings.
But
not
from
Silence.
On
her
decks
a
motley
crew
of
mutes
and
mongrels
spoke
no
word
as
the
Iron
Victory
drew
nigh.
Men
black
as
tar
stared
out
at
him,
and
others
squat
and
hairy
as
the
apes
of
Sothoros.
Monsters,
Victarion
thought.

They
dropped
anchor
twenty
yards
from
Silence.
“Lower
a
boat.
I
would
go
ashore.”
He
buckled
on
his
swordbelt
as
the
rowers
took
their
places;
his
longsword
rested
on
one
hip,
a
dirk
upon
the
other.
Nute
the
Barber
fastened
the
Lord
Captain’s
cloak
about
his
shoulders.
It
was
made
of
nine
layers
of
cloth-of-gold,
sewn
in
the
shape
of
the
kraken
of
Greyjoy,
arms
dangling
to
his
boots.
Beneath
he
wore
heavy
grey
chainmail
over
boiled
black
leather.
In
Moat
Cailin
he
had
taken
to
wearing
mail
day
and
night.
Sore
shoulders
and
an
aching
back
were
easier
to
bear
than
bloody
bowels.
The
poisoned
arrows
of
the
bog
devils
need
only
scratch
a
man,
and
a
few
hours
later
he
would
be
squirting
and
screaming
as
his
life
ran
down
his
legs
in
gouts
of
red
and
brown.
Whoever
wins
the
Seastone
Chair,
I
shall
deal
with
the
bog
devils.

Victarion
donned
a
tall
black
warhelm,
wrought
in
the
shape
of
an
iron
kraken,
its
arms
coiled
down
around
his
cheeks
to
meet
beneath
his
jaw.
By
then
the
boat
was
ready.
“I
put
the
chests
into
your
charge,”
he
told
Nute
as
he
climbed
over
the
side.
“See
that
they
are
strongly
guarded.”
Much
depended
on
the
chests.

“As
you
command,
Your
Grace.”

Victarion
returned
a
sour
scowl.
“I
am
no
king
as
yet.”
He
clambered
down
into
the
boat.

Aeron
Damphair
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
surf
with
his
waterskin
slung
beneath
one
arm.
The
priest
was
gaunt
and
tall,
though
shorter
than
Victarion.
His
nose
rose
like
a
shark’s
fin
from
a
bony
face,
and
his
eyes
were
iron.
His
beard
reached
to
his
waist,
and
tangled
ropes
of
hair
slapped
at
the
back
of
his
legs
when
the
wind
blew.
“Brother,”
he
said
as
the
waves
broke
white
and
cold
around
their
ankles,
“what
is
dead
can
never
die.”

“But
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger.”
Victarion
lifted
off
his
helm
and
knelt.
The
bay
filled
his
boots
and
soaked
his
breeches
as
Aeron
poured
a
stream
of
salt
water
down
upon
his
brow.
And
so
they
prayed.

“Where
is
our
brother
Crow’s
Eye?”
the
Lord
Captain
demanded
of
Aeron
Damphair
when
the
prayers
were
done.

“His
is
the
great
tent
of
cloth-of-gold,
there
where
the
din
is
loudest.
He
surrounds
himself
with
godless
men
and
monsters,
worse
than
before.
In
him
our
father’s
blood
went
bad.”

“Our
mother’s
blood
as
well.”
Victarion
would
not
speak
of
kinslaying,
here
in
this
godly
place
beneath
the
bones
of
Nagga
and
the
Grey
King’s
Hall,
but
many
a
night
he
dreamed
of
driving
a
mailed
fist
into
Euron’s
smiling
face,
until
the
flesh
split
and
his
bad
blood
ran
red
and
free.
I
must
not.
I
pledged
my
word
to
Balon.
“All
have
come?”
he
asked
his
priestly
brother.

“All
who
matter.
The
captains
and
the
kings.”
On
the
Iron
Islands
they
were
one
and
the
same,
for
every
captain
was
a
king
on
his
own
deck,
and
every
king
must
be
a
captain.
“Do
you
mean
to
claim
our
father’s
crown?”

Victarion
imagined
himself
seated
on
the
Seastone
Chair.
“If
the
Drowned
God
wills
it.”

“The
waves
will
speak,”
said
Aeron
Damphair
as
he
turned
away.
“Listen
to
the
waves,
brother.”

“Aye.”
He
wondered
how
his
name
would
sound
whispered
by
waves
and
shouted
by
the
captains
and
the
kings.
If
the
cup
should
pass
to
me,
I
will
not
set
it
by.

A
crowd
had
gathered
round
to
wish
him
well
and
seek
his
favor.
Victarion
saw
men
from
every
isle:
Blacktydes,
Tawneys,
Orkwoods,
Stonetrees,
Wynches,
and
many
more.
The
Goodbrothers
of
Old
Wyk,
the
Goodbrothers
of
Great
Wyk,
and
the
Goodbrothers
of
Orkmont
all
had
come.
The
Codds
were
there,
though
every
decent
man
despised
them.
Humble
Shepherds,
Weavers,
and
Netleys
rubbed
shoulders
with
men
from
Houses
ancient
and
proud;
even
humble
Humbles,
the
blood
of
thralls
and
salt
wives.
A
Volmark
clapped
Victarion
on
the
back;
two
Sparrs
pressed
a
wineskin
into
his
hands.
He
drank
deep,
wiped
his
mouth,
and
let
them
bear
him
off
to
their
cookfires,
to
listen
to
their
talk
of
war
and
crowns
and
plunder,
and
the
glory
and
the
freedom
of
his
reign.

That
night
the
men
of
the
Iron
Fleet
raised
a
huge
sailcloth
tent
above
the
tideline,
so
Victarion
might
feast
half
a
hundred
famous
captains
on
roast
kid,
salted
cod,
and
lobster.
Aeron
came
as
well.
He
ate
fish
and
drank
water,
whilst
the
captains
quaffed
enough
ale
to
float
the
Iron
Fleet.
Many
promised
him
their
voices:
Fralegg
the
Strong,
clever
Alvyn
Sharp,
humpbacked
Hotho
Harlaw.
Hotho
offered
him
a
daughter
for
his
queen.
“I
have
no
luck
with
wives,”
Victarion
told
him.
His
first
wife
died
in
childbed,
giving
him
a
stillborn
daughter.
His
second
had
been
stricken
by
a
pox.
And
his
third...

“A
king
must
have
an
heir,”
Hotho
insisted.
“The
Crow’s
Eye
brings
three
sons
to
show
before
the
kingsmoot.”

“Bastards
and
mongrels.
How
old
is
this
daughter?”

“Twelve,”
said
Hotho.
“Fair
and
fertile,
newly
flowered,
with
hair
the
color
of
honey.
Her
breasts
are
small
as
yet,
but
she
has
good
hips.
She
takes
after
her
mother,
more
than
me.”

Victarion
knew
that
to
mean
the
girl
did
not
have
a
hump.
Yet
when
he
tried
to
picture
her,
he
only
saw
the
wife
he’d
killed.
He
had
sobbed
each
time
he
struck
her,
and
afterward
carried
her
down
to
the
rocks
to
give
her
to
the
crabs.
“I
will
gladly
look
at
the
girl
once
I
am
crowned,”
he
said.
That
was
as
much
as
Hotho
dared
hope
for,
and
he
shambled
off,
content.

Baelor
Blacktyde
was
more
difficult
to
please.
He
sat
by
Victarion’s
elbow
in
his
lambswool
tunic
of
black-and-green
vairy,
smooth-faced
and
comely.
His
cloak
was
sable,
and
pinned
with
a
silver
seven-pointed
star.
He
had
been
eight
years
a
hostage
in
Oldtown,
and
had
returned
a
worshiper
of
the
seven
green
land
gods.
“Balon
was
mad,
Aeron
is
madder,
and
Euron
is
maddest
of
them
all,”
Lord
Baelor
said.
“What
of
you,
Lord
Captain?
If
I
shout
your
name,
will
you
make
an
end
of
this
mad
war?”

Victarion
frowned.
“Would
you
have
me
bend
the
knee?”

“If
need
be.
We
cannot
stand
alone
against
all
Westeros.
King
Robert
proved
that,
to
our
grief.
Balon
would
pay
the
iron
price
for
freedom,
he
said,
but
our
women
bought
Balon’s
crowns
with
empty
beds.
My
mother
was
one
such.
The
Old
Way
is
dead.”

“What
is
dead
can
never
die,
but
rises
harder
and
stronger.
In
a
hundred
years
men
will
sing
of
Balon
the
Bold.”

“Balon
the
Widowmaker,
call
him.
I
will
gladly
trade
his
freedom
for
a
father.
Have
you
one
to
give
me?”
When
Victarion
did
not
answer,
Blacktyde
snorted
and
moved
off.

The
tent
grew
hot
and
smoky.
Two
of
Gorold
Goodbrother’s
sons
knocked
a
table
over
fighting;
Will
Humble
lost
a
wager
and
had
to
eat
his
boot;
Little
Lenwood
Tawney
fiddled
whilst
Romny
Weaver
sang
“The
Bloody
Cup”
and
“Steel
Rain”
and
other
old
reaving
songs.
Qarl
the
Maid
and
Eldred
Codd
danced
the
finger
dance.
A
roar
of
laughter
went
up
when
one
of
Eldred’s
fingers
landed
in
Ralf
the
Limper’s
wine
cup.

A
woman
was
amongst
those
laughing.
Victarion
rose
and
saw
her
by
the
tent
flap,
whispering
something
in
the
ear
of
Qarl
the
Maid
that
made
him
laugh
as
well.
He
had
hoped
she
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
come
here,
yet
the
sight
of
her
made
him
smile
all
the
same.
“Asha,”
he
called
in
a
commanding
voice.
“Niece.”

She
made
her
way
to
his
side,
lean
and
lithe
in
high
boots
of
salt-stained
leather,
green
woolen
breeches,
and
brown
quilted
tunic,
a
sleeveless
leather
jerkin
half-unlaced.
“Nuncle.”
Asha
Greyjoy
was
tall
for
a
woman,
yet
she
had
to
stand
on
her
toes
to
kiss
his
cheek.
“I
am
pleased
to
see
you
at
my
queensmoot.”

“Queensmoot?”
Victarion
laughed.
“Are
you
drunk,
niece?
Sit.
I
did
not
spy
your
Black
Wind
on
the
strand.”

“I
beached
her
beneath
Norne
Goodbrother’s
castle
and
rode
across
the
island.”
She
sat
upon
a
stool
and
helped
herself
unasked
to
Nute
the
Barber’s
wine.
Nute
raised
no
objection;
he
had
passed
out
drunk
some
time
ago.
“Who
holds
the
Moat?”

“Ralf
Kenning.
With
the
Young
Wolf
dead,
only
the
bog
devils
remain
to
plague
us.”

“The
Starks
were
not
the
only
northmen.
The
Iron
Throne
has
named
the
Lord
of
the
Dreadfort
as
Warden
of
the
North.”

“Would
you
lesson
me
in
warfare?
I
was
fighting
battles
when
you
were
sucking
mother’s
milk.”

“And
losing
battles
too.”
Asha
took
a
drink
of
wine.

Victarion
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
Fair
Isle.
“Every
man
should
lose
a
battle
in
his
youth,
so
he
does
not
lose
a
war
when
he
is
old.
You
have
not
come
to
make
a
claim,
I
hope.”

She
teased
him
with
a
smile.
“And
if
I
have?”

“There
are
men
who
remember
when
you
were
a
little
girl,
swimming
naked
in
the
sea
and
playing
with
your
doll.”

“I
played
with
axes
too.”

“You
did,”
he
had
to
grant,
“but
a
woman
wants
a
husband,
not
a
crown.
When
I
am
king
I’ll
give
you
one.”

“My
nuncle
is
so
good
to
me.
Shall
I
find
a
pretty
wife
for
you,
when
I
am
queen?”

“I
have
no
luck
with
wives.
How
long
have
you
been
here?”

“Long
enough
to
see
that
Uncle
Damphair
has
woken
more
than
he
intended.
The
Drumm
means
to
make
a
claim,
and
Tarle
the
Thrice-Drowned
was
heard
to
say
that
Maron
Volmark
is
the
true
heir
of
the
black
line.”

“The
king
must
be
a
kraken.”

“The
Crow’s
Eye
is
a
kraken.
The
elder
brother
comes
before
the
younger.”
Asha
leaned
close.
“But
I
am
the
child
of
King
Balon’s
body,
so
I
come
before
you
both.
Hear
me,
nuncle...”

But
then
a
sudden
silence
fell.
The
singing
died,
Little
Lenwood
Tawney
lowered
his
fiddle,
men
turned
their
heads.
Even
the
clatter
of
plates
and
knives
was
hushed.

A
dozen
newcomers
had
entered
the
feast
tent.
Victarion
saw
Pinchface
Jon
Myre,
Torwold
Browntooth,
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd.
Germund
Botley
crossed
his
arms
against
the
gilded
breastplate
he
had
taken
off
a
Lannister
captain
during
Balon’s
first
rebellion.
Orkwood
of
Orkmont
stood
beside
him.
Behind
them
were
Stonehand,
Quellon
Humble,
and
the
Red
Oarsman
with
his
fiery
hair
in
braids.
Ralf
the
Shepherd
too,
and
Ralf
of
Lordsport,
and
Qarl
the
Thrall.

And
the
Crow’s
Eye,
Euron
Greyjoy.

He
looks
unchanged,
Victarion
thought.
He
looks
the
same
as
he
did
the
day
he
laughed
at
me
and
left.
Euron
was
the
most
comely
of
Lord
Quellon’s
sons,
and
three
years
of
exile
had
not
changed
that.
His
hair
was
still
black
as
a
midnight
sea,
with
never
a
whitecap
to
be
seen,
and
his
face
was
still
smooth
and
pale
beneath
his
neat
dark
beard.
A
black
leather
patch
covered
Euron’s
left
eye,
but
his
right
was
blue
as
a
summer
sky.

His
smiling
eye,
thought
Victarion.
“Crow’s
Eye,”
he
said.

“King
Crow’s
Eye,
brother.”
Euron
smiled.
His
lips
looked
very
dark
in
the
lamplight,
bruised
and
blue.

“We
shall
have
no
king
but
from
the
kingsmoot.”
The
Damphair
stood.
“No
godless
man—”

“—may
sit
the
Seastone
Chair,
aye.”
Euron
glanced
about
the
tent.
“As
it
happens
as
I
have
oft
sat
upon
the
Seastone
Chair
of
late.
It
raises
no
objections.”
His
smiling
eye
was
glittering.
“Who
knows
more
of
gods
than
I?
Horse
gods
and
fire
gods,
gods
made
of
gold
with
gemstone
eyes,
gods
carved
of
cedar
wood,
gods
chiseled
into
mountains,
gods
of
empty
air...
I
know
them
all.
I
have
seen
their
peoples
garland
them
with
flowers,
and
shed
the
blood
of
goats
and
bulls
and
children
in
their
names.
And
I
have
heard
the
prayers,
in
half
a
hundred
tongues.
Cure
my
withered
leg,
make
the
maiden
love
me,
grant
me
a
healthy
son.
Save
me,
succor
me,
make
me
wealthy...
protect
me!
Protect
me
from
mine
enemies,
protect
me
from
the
darkness,
protect
me
from
the
crabs
inside
my
belly,
from
the
horselords,
from
the
slavers,
from
the
sellswords
at
my
door.
Protect
me
from
the
Silence.”
He
laughed.
“Godless?
Why,
Aeron,
I
am
the
godliest
man
ever
to
raise
sail!
You
serve
one
god,
Damphair,
but
I
have
served
ten
thousand.
From
Ib
to
Asshai,
when
men
see
my
sails,
they
pray.”

The
priest
raised
a
bony
finger.
“They
pray
to
trees
and
golden
idols
and
goat-headed
abominations.
False
gods...”

“Just
so,”
said
Euron,
“and
for
that
sin
I
kill
them
all.
I
spill
their
blood
upon
the
sea
and
sow
their
screaming
women
with
my
seed.
Their
little
gods
cannot
stop
me,
so
plainly
they
are
false
gods.
I
am
more
devout
than
even
you,
Aeron.
Perhaps
it
should
be
you
who
kneels
to
me
for
blessing.”

The
Red
Oarsman
laughed
loudly
at
that,
and
the
others
took
their
lead
from
him.

“Fools,”
said
the
priest,
“fools
and
thralls
and
blind
men,
that
is
what
you
are.
Do
you
not
see
what
stands
before
you?”

“A
king,”
said
Quellon
Humble.

The
Damphair
spat,
and
strode
out
into
the
night.

When
he
was
gone,
the
Crow’s
Eye
turned
his
smiling
eye
upon
Victarion.
“Lord
Captain,
have
you
no
greeting
for
a
brother
long
away?
Nor
you,
Asha?
How
fares
your
lady
mother?”

“Poorly,”
Asha
said.
“Some
man
made
her
a
widow.”

Euron
shrugged.
“I
had
heard
the
Storm
God
swept
Balon
to
his
death.
Who
is
this
man
who
slew
him?
Tell
me
his
name,
niece,
so
I
might
revenge
myself
on
him.”

Asha
got
to
her
feet.
“You
know
his
name
as
well
as
I.
Three
years
you
were
gone
from
us,
and
yet
Silence
returns
within
a
day
of
my
lord
father’s
death.”

“Do
you
accuse
me?”
Euron
asked
mildly.

“Should
I?”
The
sharpness
in
Asha’s
voice
made
Victarion
frown.
It
was
dangerous
to
speak
so
to
the
Crow’s
Eye,
even
when
his
smiling
eye
was
shining
with
amusement.

“Do
I
command
the
winds?”
the
Crow’s
Eye
asked
his
pets.

“No,
Your
Grace,”
said
Orkwood
of
Orkmont.

“No
man
commands
the
winds,”
said
Germund
Botley.

“Would
that
you
did,”
the
Red
Oarsman
said.
“You
would
sail
wherever
you
liked
and
never
be
becalmed.”

“There
you
have
it,
from
the
mouths
of
three
brave
men,”
Euron
said.
“The
Silence
was
at
sea
when
Balon
died.
If
you
doubt
an
uncle’s
word,
I
give
you
leave
to
ask
my
crew.”

“A
crew
of
mutes?
Aye,
that
would
serve
me
well.”

“A
husband
would
serve
you
well.”
Euron
turned
to
his
followers
again.
“Torwold,
I
misremember,
do
you
have
a
wife?”

“Only
the
one.”
Torwold
Browntooth
grinned,
and
showed
how
he
had
won
his
name.

“I
am
unwed,”
announced
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd.

“And
for
good
reason,”
Asha
said.
“All
women
do
despise
the
Codds
as
well.
Don’t
look
at
me
so
mournful,
Lucas.
You
still
have
your
famous
hand.”
She
made
a
pumping
motion
with
her
fist.

Codd
cursed,
till
the
Crow’s
Eye
put
a
hand
upon
his
chest.
“Was
that
courteous,
Asha?
You
have
wounded
Lucas
to
the
quick.”

“Easier
than
wounding
him
in
the
prick.
I
throw
an
axe
as
well
as
any
man,
but
when
the
target
is
so
small...”

“This
girl
forgets
herself,”
snarled
Pinchface
Jon
Myre.
“Balon
let
her
believe
she
was
a
man.”

“Your
father
made
the
same
mistake
with
you,”
said
Asha.

“Give
her
to
me,
Euron,”
suggested
the
Red
Oarsman.
“I’ll
spank
her
till
her
arse
is
as
red
as
my
hair.”

“Come
try,”
said
Asha,
“and
hereafter
we
can
call
you
the
Red
Eunuch.”
A
throwing
axe
was
in
her
hand.
She
tossed
it
in
the
air
and
caught
it
deftly.
“Here
is
my
husband,
Nuncle.
Any
man
who
wants
me
should
take
it
up
with
him.”

Victarion
slammed
his
fist
upon
the
table.
“I’ll
have
no
blood
shed
here.
Euron,
take
your...
pets...
and
go.”

“I
had
looked
for
a
warmer
welcome
from
you,
brother.
I
am
your
elder...
and
soon,
your
rightful
king.”

Victarion’s
face
darkened.
“When
the
kingsmoot
speaks,
we
shall
see
who
wears
the
driftwood
crown.”

“On
that
we
can
agree.”
Euron
lifted
two
fingers
to
the
patch
that
covered
his
left
eye,
and
took
his
leave.
The
others
followed
at
his
heels
like
mongrel
dogs.
Silence
lingered
behind
them,
till
Little
Lenwood
Tawney
took
up
his
fiddle.
The
wine
and
ale
began
to
flow
again,
but
several
guests
had
lost
their
thirst.
Eldred
Codd
slipped
out,
cradling
his
bloody
hand.
Then
Will
Humble,
Hotho
Harlaw,
a
goodly
lot
of
Goodbrothers.

“Nuncle.”
Asha
put
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder.
“Walk
with
me,
if
you
would.”

Outside
the
tent
the
wind
was
rising.
Clouds
raced
across
the
moon’s
pale
face.
They
looked
a
bit
like
galleys,
stroking
hard
to
ram.
The
stars
were
few
and
faint.
All
along
the
strand
the
longships
rested,
tall
masts
rising
like
a
forest
from
the
surf.
Victarion
could
hear
their
hulls
creaking
as
they
settled
on
the
sand.
He
heard
the
keening
of
their
lines,
the
sound
of
banners
flapping.
Beyond,
in
the
deeper
waters
of
the
bay,
larger
ships
bobbed
at
anchor,
grim
shadows
wreathed
in
mist.

They
walked
along
the
strand
together
just
above
the
surf,
far
from
the
camps
and
the
cookfires.
“Tell
me
true,
nuncle,”
Asha
said,
“why
did
Euron
go
away
so
suddenly?”

“The
Crow’s
Eye
oft
went
reaving.”

“Never
for
so
long.”

“He
took
the
Silence
east.
A
lengthy
voyage.”

“I
asked
why
he
went,
not
where.”
When
he
did
not
answer,
Asha
said,
“I
was
away
when
Silence
sailed.
I
had
taken
Black
Wind
around
the
Arbor
to
the
Stepstones,
to
steal
a
few
trinkets
from
the
Lyseni
pirates.
When
I
came
home,
Euron
was
gone
and
your
new
wife
was
dead.”

“She
was
only
a
salt
wife.”
He
had
not
touched
another
woman
since
he
gave
her
to
the
crabs.
I
will
need
to
take
a
wife
when
I
am
king.
A
true
wife,
to
be
my
queen
and
bear
me
sons.
A
king
must
have
an
heir.

“My
father
refused
to
speak
of
her,”
said
Asha.

“It
does
no
good
to
speak
of
things
no
man
can
change.”
He
was
weary
of
the
subject.
“I
saw
the
Reader’s
longship.”

“It
took
all
my
charm
to
winkle
him
out
of
his
Book
Tower.”

She
has
the
Harlaws,
then.
Victarion’s
frown
grew
deeper.
“You
cannot
hope
to
rule.
You
are
a
woman.”

“Is
that
why
I
always
lose
the
pissing
contests?”
Asha
laughed.
“Nuncle,
it
grieves
me
to
say
so,
but
you
may
be
right.
For
four
days
and
four
nights,
I
have
been
drinking
with
the
captains
and
the
kings,
listening
to
what
they
say...
and
what
they
will
not
say.
Mine
own
are
with
me,
and
many
Harlaws.
I
have
Tris
Botley
too,
and
some
few
others.
Not
enough.”
She
kicked
a
rock,
and
sent
it
splashing
into
the
water
between
two
longships.
“I
am
of
a
mind
to
shout
my
nuncle’s
name.”

“Which
uncle?”
he
demanded.
“You
have
three.”

“Four.
Nuncle,
hear
me.
I
will
place
the
driftwood
crown
upon
your
brow
myself...
if
you
will
agree
to
share
the
rule.”

“Share
the
rule?
How
could
that
be?”
The
woman
was
not
making
sense.
Does
she
want
to
be
my
queen?
Victarion
found
himself
looking
at
Asha
in
a
way
he
had
never
looked
at
her
before.
He
could
feel
his
manhood
beginning
to
stiffen.
She
is
Balon’s
daughter,
he
reminded
himself.
He
remembered
her
as
a
little
girl,
throwing
axes
at
a
door.
He
crossed
his
arms
against
his
chest.
“The
Seastone
Chair
seats
but
one.”

“Then
let
my
nuncle
sit,”
Asha
said.
“I
will
stand
behind
you,
to
guard
your
back
and
whisper
in
your
ear.
No
king
can
rule
alone.
Even
when
the
dragons
sat
the
Iron
Throne,
they
had
men
to
help
them.
The
King’s
Hands.
Let
me
be
your
Hand,
Nuncle.”

No
King
of
the
Isles
had
ever
needed
a
Hand,
much
less
one
who
was
a
woman.
The
captains
and
the
kings
would
mock
me
in
their
cups.
“Why
would
you
wish
to
be
my
Hand?”

“To
end
this
war
before
this
war
ends
us.
We
have
won
all
that
we
are
like
to
win...
and
stand
to
lose
all
just
as
quick,
unless
we
make
a
peace.
I
have
shown
Lady
Glover
every
courtesy,
and
she
swears
her
lord
will
treat
with
me.
If
we
hand
back
Deepwood
Motte,
Torrhen’s
Square,
and
Moat
Cailin,
she
says,
the
northmen
will
cede
us
Sea
Dragon
Point
and
all
the
Stony
Shore.
Those
lands
are
thinly
peopled,
yet
ten
times
larger
than
all
the
isles
put
together.
An
exchange
of
hostages
will
seal
the
pact,
and
each
side
will
agree
to
make
common
cause
with
the
other
should
the
Iron
Throne—”

Victarion
chuckled.
“This
Lady
Glover
plays
you
for
a
fool,
niece.
Sea
Dragon
Point
and
the
Stony
Shore
are
ours.
Why
hand
back
anything?
Winterfell
is
burnt
and
broken,
and
the
Young
Wolf
rots
headless
in
the
earth.
We
will
have
all
the
north,
as
your
lord
father
dreamed.”

“When
longships
learn
to
row
through
trees,
perhaps.
A
fisherman
may
hook
a
grey
leviathan,
but
it
will
drag
him
down
to
death
unless
he
cuts
it
loose.
The
north
is
too
large
for
us
to
hold,
and
too
full
of
northmen.”

“Go
back
to
your
dolls,
niece.
Leave
the
winning
of
wars
to
warriors.”
Victarion
showed
her
his
fists.
“I
have
two
hands.
No
man
needs
three.”

“I
know
a
man
who
needs
House
Harlaw,
though.”

“Hotho
Humpback
has
offered
me
his
daughter
for
my
queen.
If
I
take
her,
I
will
have
the
Harlaws.”

That
took
the
girl
aback.
“Lord
Rodrik
rules
House
Harlaw.”

“Rodrik
has
no
daughters,
only
books.
Hotho
will
be
his
heir,
and
I
will
be
the
king.”
Once
he
had
said
the
words
aloud,
they
sounded
true.
“The
Crow’s
Eye
has
been
too
long
away.”

“Some
men
look
larger
at
a
distance,”
Asha
warned.
“Walk
amongst
the
cookfires
if
you
dare,
and
listen.
They
are
not
telling
tales
of
your
strength,
nor
of
my
famous
beauty.
They
talk
only
of
the
Crow’s
Eye;
the
far
places
he
has
seen,
the
women
he
has
raped
and
the
men
he’s
killed,
the
cities
he
has
sacked,
the
way
he
burnt
Lord
Tywin’s
fleet
at
Lannisport...”

“I
burnt
the
lion’s
fleet,”
Victarion
insisted.
“With
mine
own
hands
I
flung
the
first
torch
onto
his
flagship.”

“The
Crow’s
Eye
hatched
the
scheme.”
Asha
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm.
“And
killed
your
wife
as
well...
did
he
not?”

Balon
had
commanded
them
not
to
speak
of
it,
but
Balon
was
dead.
“He
put
a
baby
in
her
belly
and
made
me
do
the
killing.
I
would
have
killed
him
too,
but
Balon
would
have
no
kinslaying
in
his
hall.
He
sent
Euron
into
exile,
never
to
return...”

“...so
long
as
Balon
lived?”

Victarion
looked
at
his
fists.
“She
gave
me
horns.
I
had
no
choice.”
Had
it
been
known,
men
would
have
laughed
at
me,
as
the
Crow’s
Eye
laughed
when
I
confronted
him.
“She
came
to
me
wet
and
willing,”
he
had
boasted.
“It
seems
Victarion
is
big
everywhere
but
where
it
matters.”
But
he
could
not
tell
her
that.

“I
am
sorry
for
you,”
said
Asha,
“and
sorrier
for
her...
but
you
leave
me
small
choice
but
to
claim
the
Seastone
Chair
myself.”

You
cannot.
“Your
breath
is
yours
to
waste,
woman.”

“It
is,”
she
said,
and
left
him.





THE
DROWNED
MAN

Only
when
his
arms
and
legs
were
numb
from
the
cold
did
Aeron
Greyjoy
struggle
back
to
shore
and
don
his
robes
again.

He
had
run
before
the
Crow’s
Eye
as
if
he
were
still
the
weak
thing
he
had
been,
but
when
the
waves
broke
over
his
head
they
reminded
once
more
that
that
man
was
dead.
I
was
reborn
from
the
sea,
a
harder
man
and
stronger.
No
mortal
man
could
frighten
him,
no
more
than
the
darkness
could,
nor
the
bones
of
his
soul,
the
grey
and
grisly
bones
of
his
soul.
The
sound
of
a
door
opening,
the
scream
of
a
rusted
iron
hinge.

The
priest’s
robes
crackled
as
he
pulled
them
down,
still
stiff
with
salt
from
their
last
washing
a
fortnight
past.
The
wool
clung
to
his
wet
chest,
drinking
the
brine
that
ran
down
from
his
hair.
He
filled
his
waterskin
and
slung
it
over
his
shoulder.

As
he
strode
across
the
strand,
a
drowned
man
returning
from
a
call
of
nature
stumbled
into
him
in
the
darkness.
“Damphair,”
he
murmured.
Aeron
laid
a
hand
upon
his
head,
blessed
him,
and
moved
on.
The
ground
rose
beneath
his
feet,
gently
at
first,
then
more
steeply.
When
he
felt
scrub
grass
between
his
toes,
he
knew
that
he
had
left
the
strand
behind.
Slowly
he
climbed,
listening
to
the
waves.
The
sea
is
never
weary.
I
must
be
as
tireless.

On
the
crown
of
the
hill
four-and-forty
monstrous
stone
ribs
rose
from
the
earth
like
the
trunks
of
great
pale
trees.
The
sight
made
Aeron’s
heart
beat
faster.
Nagga
had
been
the
first
sea
dragon,
the
mightiest
ever
to
rise
from
the
waves.
She
fed
on
krakens
and
leviathans
and
drowned
whole
islands
in
her
wrath,
yet
the
Grey
King
had
slain
her
and
the
Drowned
God
had
changed
her
bones
to
stone
so
that
men
might
never
cease
to
wonder
at
the
courage
of
the
first
of
kings.
Nagga’s
ribs
became
the
beams
and
pillars
of
his
longhall,
just
as
her
jaws
became
his
throne.
For
a
thousand
years
and
seven
he
reigned
here,
Aeron
recalled.
Here
he
took
his
mermaid
wife
and
planned
his
wars
against
the
Storm
God.
From
here
he
ruled
both
stone
and
salt,
wearing
robes
of
woven
seaweed
and
a
tall
pale
crown
made
from
Nagga’s
teeth.

But
that
was
in
the
dawn
of
days,
when
mighty
men
still
dwelt
on
earth
and
sea.
The
hall
had
been
warmed
by
Nagga’s
living
fire,
which
the
Grey
King
had
made
his
thrall.
On
its
walls
hung
tapestries
woven
from
silver
seaweed
most
pleasing
to
the
eyes.
The
Grey
King’s
warriors
had
feasted
on
the
bounty
of
the
sea
at
a
table
in
the
shape
of
a
great
starfish,
whilst
seated
upon
thrones
carved
from
mother-of-pearl.
Gone,
all
the
glory
gone.
Men
were
smaller
now.
Their
lives
had
grown
short.
The
Storm
God
drowned
Nagga’s
fire
after
the
Grey
King’s
death,
the
chairs
and
tapestries
had
been
stolen,
the
roof
and
walls
had
rotted
away.
Even
the
Grey
King’s
great
throne
of
fangs
had
been
swallowed
by
the
sea.
Only
Nagga’s
bones
endured
to
remind
the
ironborn
of
all
the
wonder
that
had
been.

It
is
enough,
thought
Aeron
Greyjoy.

Nine
wide
steps
had
been
hewn
from
the
stony
hilltop.
Behind
rose
the
howling
hills
of
Old
Wyk,
with
mountains
in
the
distance
black
and
cruel.
Aeron
paused
where
the
doors
once
stood,
pulled
the
cork
from
his
waterskin,
took
a
swallow
of
salt
water,
and
turned
to
face
the
sea.
We
were
born
from
the
sea,
and
to
the
sea
we
must
return.
Even
here
he
could
hear
the
ceaseless
rumble
of
the
waves
and
feel
the
power
of
the
god
who
lurked
below
the
waters.
Aeron
went
to
his
knees.
You
have
sent
your
people
to
me,
he
prayed.
They
have
left
their
halls
and
hovels,
their
castles
and
their
keeps,
and
come
here
to
Nagga’s
bones,
from
every
fishing
village
and
every
hidden
vale.
Now
grant
to
them
the
wisdom
to
know
the
true
king
when
he
stands
before
them,
and
the
strength
to
shun
the
false.
All
night
he
prayed,
for
when
the
god
was
in
him
Aeron
Greyjoy
had
no
need
of
sleep,
no
more
than
the
waves
did,
nor
the
fishes
of
the
sea.

Dark
clouds
ran
before
the
wind
as
the
first
light
stole
into
the
world.
The
black
sky
went
grey
as
slate;
the
black
sea
turned
grey-green;
the
black
mountains
of
Great
Wyk
across
the
bay
put
on
the
blue-green
hues
of
soldier
pines.
As
color
stole
back
into
the
world,
a
hundred
banners
lifted
and
began
to
flap.
Aeron
beheld
the
silver
fish
of
Botley,
the
bloody
moon
of
Wynch,
the
dark
green
trees
of
Orkwood.
He
saw
warhorns
and
leviathans
and
scythes,
and
everywhere
the
krakens
great
and
golden.
Beneath
them,
thralls
and
salt
wives
begin
to
move
about,
stirring
coals
into
new
life
and
gutting
fish
for
the
captains
and
the
kings
to
break
their
fasts.
The
dawnlight
touched
the
stony
strand,
and
he
watched
men
wake
from
sleep,
throwing
aside
their
sealskin
blankets
as
they
called
for
their
first
horn
of
ale.
Drink
deep,
he
thought,
for
we
have
god’s
work
to
do
today.

The
sea
was
stirring
too.
The
waves
grew
larger
as
the
wind
rose,
sending
plumes
of
spray
to
crash
against
the
longships.
The
Drowned
God
wakes,
thought
Aeron.
He
could
hear
his
voice
welling
from
the
depths
of
the
sea.
I
shall
be
with
you
here
this
day,
my
strong
and
faithful
servant,
the
voice
said.
No
godless
man
will
sit
my
Seastone
Chair.

It
was
there
beneath
the
arch
of
Nagga’s
ribs
that
his
drowned
men
found
him,
standing
tall
and
stern
with
his
long
black
hair
blowing
in
the
wind.
“Is
it
time?”
Rus
asked.
Aeron
gave
a
nod,
and
said,
“It
is.
Go
forth
and
sound
the
summons.”

The
drowned
men
took
up
their
driftwood
cudgels
and
began
to
beat
them
one
against
the
other
as
they
walked
back
down
the
hill.
Others
joined
them,
and
the
clangor
spread
along
the
strand.
Such
a
fearful
clacking
and
a
clattering
it
made,
as
if
a
hundred
trees
were
pummeling
one
another
with
their
limbs.
Kettledrums
began
to
beat
as
well,
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom,
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom.
A
warhorn
bellowed,
then
another.
AAAAAAoooooooooooooooooooooooo.

Men
left
their
fires
to
make
their
way
toward
the
bones
of
the
Grey
King’s
Hall;
oarsmen,
steersmen,
sailmakers,
shipwrights,
the
warriors
with
their
axes
and
the
fishermen
with
their
nets.
Some
had
thralls
to
serve
them;
some
had
salt
wives.
Others,
who
had
sailed
too
often
to
the
green
lands,
were
attended
by
maesters
and
singers
and
knights.
The
common
men
crowded
together
in
a
crescent
around
the
base
of
the
knoll,
with
the
thralls,
children,
and
women
toward
the
rear.
The
captains
and
the
kings
made
their
way
up
the
slopes.
Aeron
Damphair
saw
cheerful
Sigfry
Stonetree,
Andrik
the
Unsmiling,
the
knight
Ser
Harras
Harlaw.
Lord
Baelor
Blacktyde
in
his
sable
cloak
stood
beside
The
Stonehouse
in
ragged
sealskin.
Victarion
loomed
above
all
of
them
save
Andrik.
His
brother
wore
no
helm,
but
elsewise
he
was
all
in
armor,
his
kraken
cloak
hanging
golden
from
his
shoulders.
He
shall
be
our
king.
What
man
could
look
on
him
and
doubt
it?

When
the
Damphair
raised
his
bony
hands
the
kettledrums
and
the
warhorns
fell
silent,
the
drowned
men
lowered
their
cudgels,
and
all
the
voices
stilled.
Only
the
sound
of
the
waves
pounding
remained,
a
roar
no
man
could
still.
“We
were
born
from
the
sea,
and
to
the
sea
we
all
return,”
Aeron
began,
softly
at
first,
so
men
would
strain
to
hear.
“The
Storm
God
in
his
wrath
plucked
Balon
from
his
castle
and
cast
him
down,
yet
now
he
feasts
beneath
the
waves
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls.”
He
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
sky.
“Balon
is
dead!
The
iron
king
is
dead!”

“The
king
is
dead!”
his
drowned
men
shouted.

“Yet
what
is
dead
may
never
die,
but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger!”
he
reminded
them.
“Balon
has
fallen,
Balon
my
brother,
who
honored
the
Old
Way
and
paid
the
iron
price.
Balon
the
Brave,
Balon
the
Blessed,
Balon
Twice-Crowned,
who
won
us
back
our
freedoms
and
our
god.
Balon
is
dead...
but
an
iron
king
shall
rise
again,
to
sit
upon
the
Seastone
Chair
and
rule
the
isles.”

“A
king
shall
rise!”
they
answered.
“He
shall
rise!”

“He
shall.
He
must.”
Aeron’s
voice
thundered
like
the
waves.
“But
who?
Who
shall
sit
in
Balon’s
place?
Who
shall
rule
these
holy
isles?
Is
he
here
among
us
now?”
The
priest
spread
his
hands
wide.
“Who
shall
be
king
over
us?”

A
seagull
screamed
back
at
him.
The
crowd
began
to
stir,
like
men
waking
from
a
dream.
Each
man
looked
at
his
neighbors,
to
see
which
of
them
might
presume
to
claim
a
crown.
The
Crow’s
Eye
was
never
patient,
Aeron
Damphair
told
himself.
Mayhaps
he
will
speak
first.
If
so,
it
would
be
his
undoing.
The
captains
and
the
kings
had
come
a
long
way
to
this
feast
and
would
not
choose
the
first
dish
set
before
them.
They
will
want
to
taste
and
sample,
a
bite
of
him,
a
nibble
of
the
other,
until
they
find
the
one
that
suits
them
best.

Euron
must
have
known
that
as
well.
He
stood
with
his
arms
crossed
amongst
his
mutes
and
monsters.
Only
the
wind
and
the
waves
answered
Aeron’s
call.

“The
ironborn
must
have
a
king,”
the
priest
insisted,
after
a
long
silence.
“I
ask
again.
Who
shall
be
king
over
us?”

“I
will,”
came
the
answer
from
below.

At
once
a
ragged
cry
of
“Gylbert!
Gylbert
King!”
went
up.
The
captains
gave
way
to
let
the
claimant
and
his
champions
ascend
the
hill
to
stand
at
Aeron’s
side
beneath
the
ribs
of
Nagga.

This
would-be
king
was
a
tall
spare
lord
with
a
melancholy
visage,
his
lantern
jaw
shaved
clean.
His
three
champions
took
up
their
position
two
steps
below
him,
bearing
his
sword
and
shield
and
banner.
They
shared
a
certain
look
with
the
tall
lord,
and
Aeron
took
them
for
his
sons.
One
unfurled
his
banner,
a
great
black
longship
against
a
setting
sun.
“I
am
Gylbert
Farwynd,
Lord
of
the
Lonely
Light,”
the
lord
told
the
kingsmoot.

Aeron
knew
some
Farwynds,
a
queer
folk
who
held
lands
on
the
westernmost
shores
of
Great
Wyk
and
the
scattered
isles
beyond,
rocks
so
small
that
most
could
support
but
a
single
household.
Of
those,
the
Lonely
Light
was
the
most
distant,
eight
days’
sail
to
the
northwest
amongst
rookeries
of
seals
and
sea
lions
and
the
boundless
grey
oceans.
The
Farwynds
there
were
even
queerer
than
the
rest.
Some
said
they
were
skinchangers,
unholy
creatures
who
could
take
on
the
forms
of
sea
lions,
walruses,
even
spotted
whales,
the
wolves
of
the
wild
sea.

Lord
Gylbert
began
to
speak.
He
told
of
a
wondrous
land
beyond
the
Sunset
Sea,
a
land
without
winter
or
want,
where
death
had
no
dominion.
“Make
me
your
king,
and
I
shall
lead
you
there,”
he
cried.
“We
will
build
ten
thousand
ships
as
Nymeria
once
did
and
take
sail
with
all
our
people
to
the
land
beyond
the
sunset.
There
every
man
shall
be
a
king
and
every
wife
a
queen.”

His
eyes,
Aeron
saw,
were
now
grey,
now
blue,
as
changeable
as
the
seas.
Mad
eyes,
he
thought,
fool’s
eyes.
The
vision
he
spoke
of
was
doubtless
a
snare
set
by
the
Storm
God
to
lure
the
ironborn
to
destruction.
The
offerings
that
his
men
spilled
out
before
the
kingsmoot
included
sealskins
and
walrus
tusks,
arm
rings
made
of
whalebone,
warhorns
banded
in
bronze.
The
captains
looked
and
turned
away,
leaving
lesser
men
to
help
themselves
to
the
gifts.
When
the
fool
was
done
talking
and
his
champions
began
to
shout
his
name,
only
the
Farwynds
took
up
the
cry,
and
not
even
all
of
them.
Soon
enough
the
cries
of
“Gylbert!
Gylbert
King!”
faded
away
to
silence.
The
gull
screamed
loudly
above
them,
and
landed
atop
one
of
Nagga’s
ribs
as
the
Lord
of
the
Lonely
Light
made
his
way
back
down
the
hill.

Aeron
Damphair
stepped
forward
once
more.
“I
ask
again.
Who
shall
be
king
over
us?”

“Me!”
a
deep
voice
boomed,
and
once
more
the
crowd
parted.

The
speaker
was
borne
up
the
hill
in
a
carved
driftwood
chair
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
his
grandsons.
A
great
ruin
of
a
man,
twenty
stones
heavy
and
ninety
years
old,
he
was
cloaked
in
a
white
bearskin.
His
own
hair
was
snow
white
as
well,
and
his
huge
beard
covered
him
like
a
blanket
from
cheeks
to
thighs,
so
it
was
hard
to
tell
where
the
beard
ended
and
the
pelt
began.
Though
his
grandsons
were
great
strapping
men,
they
struggled
with
his
weight
on
the
steep
stone
steps.
Before
the
Grey
King’s
Hall
they
set
him
down,
and
three
remained
below
him
as
his
champions.

Sixty
years
ago,
this
one
might
well
have
won
the
favor
of
the
moot,
Aeron
thought,
but
his
hour
is
long
past.

“Aye,
me!”
the
man
roared
from
where
he
sat,
in
a
voice
as
huge
as
he
was.
“Why
not?
Who
better?
I
am
Erik
Ironmaker,
for
them
who’s
blind.
Erik
the
Just.
Erik
Anvil-Breaker.
Show
them
my
hammer,
Thormor.”
One
of
his
champions
lifted
it
up
for
all
to
see;
a
monstrous
thing
it
was,
its
haft
wrapped
in
old
leather,
its
head
a
brick
of
steel
as
large
as
a
loaf
of
bread.
“I
can’t
count
how
many
hands
I’ve
smashed
to
pulp
with
that
hammer,”
Erik
said,
“but
might
be
some
thief
could
tell
you.
I
can’t
say
how
many
heads
I’ve
crushed
against
my
anvil
neither,
but
there’s
some
widows
could.
I
could
tell
you
all
the
deeds
I’ve
done
in
battle,
but
I’m
eight-and-eighty
and
won’t
live
long
enough
to
finish.
If
old
is
wise,
no
one
is
wiser
than
me.
If
big
is
strong,
no
one’s
stronger.
You
want
a
king
with
heirs?
I’ve
more’n
I
can
count.
King
Erik,
aye,
I
like
the
sound
o’
that.
Come,
say
it
with
me.
ERIK!
ERIK
ANVIL-BREAKER!
ERIK
KING!”

As
his
grandsons
took
up
the
cry,
their
own
sons
came
forward
with
chests
upon
their
shoulders.
When
they
upended
them
at
the
base
of
the
stone
steps,
a
torrent
of
silver,
bronze,
and
steel
spilled
forth;
arm
rings,
collars,
daggers,
dirks,
and
throwing
axes.
A
few
captains
snatched
up
the
choicest
items
and
added
their
voices
to
the
swelling
chant.
But
no
sooner
had
the
cry
begun
to
build
than
a
woman’s
voice
cut
through
it.
“Erik!”
Men
moved
aside
to
let
her
through.
With
one
foot
on
the
lowest
step,
she
said,
“Erik,
stand
up.”

A
hush
fell.
The
wind
blew,
waves
broke
against
the
shore,
men
murmured
in
each
other’s
ears.
Erik
Ironmaker
stared
down
at
Asha
Greyjoy.
“Girl.
Thrice-damned
girl.
What
did
you
say?”

“Stand
up,
Erik,”
she
called.
“Stand
up
and
I’ll
shout
your
name
with
all
the
rest.
Stand
up
and
I’ll
be
the
first
to
follow
you.
You
want
a
crown,
aye.
Stand
up
and
take
it.”

Elsewhere
in
the
press,
the
Crow’s
Eye
laughed.
Erik
glared
at
him.
The
big
man’s
hands
closed
tight
around
the
arms
of
his
driftwood
throne.
His
face
went
red,
then
purple.
His
arms
trembled
with
effort.
Aeron
could
see
a
thick
blue
vein
pulsing
in
his
neck
as
he
struggled
to
rise.
For
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
he
might
do
it,
but
the
breath
went
out
of
him
all
at
once,
and
he
groaned
and
sank
back
onto
his
cushion.
Euron
laughed
all
the
louder.
The
big
man
hung
his
head
and
grew
old,
all
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
His
grandsons
carried
him
back
down
the
hill.

“Who
shall
rule
the
ironborn?”
Aeron
Damphair
called
again.
“Who
shall
be
king
over
us?”

Men
looked
at
one
another.
Some
looked
at
Euron,
some
at
Victarion,
a
few
at
Asha.
Waves
broke
green
and
white
against
the
longships.
The
gull
cried
once
more,
a
raucous
scream,
forlorn.
“Make
your
claim,
Victarion,”
the
Merlyn
called.
“Let
us
have
done
with
this
mummer’s
farce.”

“When
I
am
ready,”
Victarion
shouted
back.

Aeron
was
pleased.
It
is
better
if
he
waits.

The
Drumm
came
next,
another
old
man,
though
not
so
old
as
Erik.
He
climbed
the
hill
on
his
own
two
legs,
and
on
his
hip
rode
Red
Rain,
his
famous
sword,
forged
of
Valyrian
steel
in
the
days
before
the
Doom.
His
champions
were
men
of
note:
his
sons
Denys
and
Donnel,
both
stout
fighters,
and
between
them
Andrik
the
Unsmiling,
a
giant
of
a
man
with
arms
as
thick
as
trees.
It
spoke
well
of
the
Drumm
that
such
a
man
would
stand
for
him.

“Where
is
it
written
that
our
king
must
be
a
kraken?”
Drumm
began.
“What
right
has
Pyke
to
rule
us?
Great
Wyk
is
the
largest
isle,
Harlaw
the
richest,
Old
Wyk
the
most
holy.
When
the
black
line
was
consumed
by
dragonfire,
the
ironborn
gave
the
primacy
to
Vickon
Greyjoy,
aye...
but
as
lord,
not
king.”

It
was
a
good
beginning.
Aeron
heard
shouts
of
approval,
but
they
dwindled
as
the
old
man
began
to
tell
of
the
glory
of
the
Drumms.
He
spoke
of
Dale
the
Dread,
Roryn
the
Reaver,
the
hundred
sons
of
Gormond
Drumm
the
Oldfather.
He
drew
Red
Rain
and
told
them
how
Hilmar
Drumm
the
Cunning
had
taken
the
blade
from
an
armored
knight
with
wits
and
a
wooden
cudgel.
He
spoke
of
ships
long
lost
and
battles
eight
hundred
years
forgotten,
and
the
crowd
grew
restive.
He
spoke
and
spoke,
and
then
he
spoke
still
more.

And
when
Drumm’s
chests
were
thrown
open,
the
captains
saw
the
niggard’s
gifts
he’d
brought
them.
No
throne
was
ever
bought
with
bronze,
the
Damphair
thought.
The
truth
of
that
was
plain
to
hear,
as
the
cries
of
“Drumm!
Drumm!
Dunstan
King!”
died
away.

Aeron
could
feel
a
tightness
in
his
belly,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
waves
were
pounding
louder
than
before.
It
is
time,
he
thought.
It
is
time
for
Victarion
to
make
his
claim.
“Who
shall
be
king
over
us?”
the
priest
cried
once
more,
but
this
time
his
fierce
black
eyes
found
his
brother
in
the
crowd.
“Nine
sons
were
born
from
the
loins
of
Quellon
Greyjoy.
One
was
mightier
than
all
the
rest,
and
knew
no
fear.”

Victarion
met
his
eyes,
and
nodded.
The
captains
parted
before
him
as
he
climbed
the
steps.
“Brother,
give
me
blessing,”
he
said
when
he
reached
the
top.
He
knelt
and
bowed
his
head.
Aeron
uncorked
his
waterskin
and
poured
a
stream
of
seawater
down
upon
his
brow.
“What
is
dead
can
never
die,”
the
priest
said,
and
Victarion
replied,
“but
rises
again,
harder
and
stronger.”

When
Victarion
rose,
his
champions
arrayed
themselves
beneath
him;
Ralf
the
Limper,
Red
Ralf
Stonehouse,
and
Nute
the
Barber,
noted
warriors
all.
Stonehouse
bore
the
Greyjoy
banner;
the
golden
kraken
on
a
field
as
black
as
the
midnight
sea.
As
soon
as
it
unfurled,
the
captains
and
the
kings
began
to
shout
out
the
Lord
Captain’s
name.
Victarion
waited
till
they
quieted,
then
said,
“You
all
know
me.
If
you
want
sweet
words,
look
elsewhere.
I
have
no
singer’s
tongue.
I
have
an
axe,
and
I
have
these.”
He
raised
his
huge
mailed
hands
up
to
show
them,
and
Nute
the
Barber
displayed
his
axe,
a
fearsome
piece
of
steel.
“I
was
a
loyal
brother,”
Victarion
went
on.
“When
Balon
was
wed,
it
was
me
he
sent
to
Harlaw
to
bring
him
back
his
bride.
I
led
his
longships
into
many
a
battle,
and
never
lost
but
one.
The
first
time
Balon
took
a
crown,
it
was
me
sailed
into
Lannisport
to
singe
the
lion’s
tail.
The
second
time,
it
was
me
he
sent
to
skin
the
Young
Wolf
should
he
come
howling
home.
All
you’ll
get
from
me
is
more
of
what
you
got
from
Balon.
That’s
all
I
have
to
say.”

With
that
his
champions
began
to
chant:
“VICTARION!
VICTARION!
VICTARION
KING!”
Below,
his
men
were
spilling
out
his
chests,
a
cascade
of
silver,
gold,
and
gems,
a
wealth
of
plunder.
Captains
scrambled
to
seize
the
richest
pieces,
shouting
as
they
did
so.
“VICTARION!
VICTARION!
VICTARION
KING!”
Aeron
watched
the
Crow’s
Eye.
Will
he
speak
now,
or
let
the
kingsmoot
run
its
course?
Orkwood
of
Orkmont
was
whispering
in
Euron’s
ear.

But
it
was
not
Euron
who
put
an
end
to
the
shouting,
it
was
the
woman.
She
put
two
fingers
in
her
mouth
and
whistled,
a
sharp
shrill
sound
that
cut
through
the
tumult
like
a
knife
through
curds.
“Nuncle!
Nuncle!”
Bending,
she
snatched
up
a
twisted
golden
collar
and
bounded
up
the
steps.
Nute
seized
her
by
the
arm,
and
for
half
a
heartbeat
Aeron
was
hopeful
that
his
brother’s
champions
would
keep
her
silent,
but
Asha
wrenched
free
of
the
Barber’s
hand
and
said
something
to
Red
Ralf
that
made
him
step
aside.
As
she
pushed
past,
the
cheering
died
away.
She
was
Balon
Greyjoy’s
daughter,
and
the
crowd
was
curious
to
hear
her
speak.

“It
was
good
of
you
to
bring
such
gifts
to
my
queensmoot,
Nuncle,”
she
told
Victarion,
“but
you
need
not
have
worn
so
much
armor.
I
promise
not
to
hurt
you.”
Asha
turned
to
face
the
captains.
“There’s
no
one
braver
than
my
nuncle,
no
one
stronger,
no
one
fiercer
in
a
fight.
And
he
counts
to
ten
as
quick
as
any
man,
I
have
seen
him
do
it...
though
when
he
needs
to
go
to
twenty
he
does
take
off
his
boots.”
That
made
them
laugh.
“He
has
no
sons,
though.
His
wives
keep
dying.
The
Crow’s
Eye
is
his
elder
and
has
a
better
claim...”

“He
does!”
the
Red
Oarsman
shouted
from
below.

“Ah,
but
my
claim
is
better
still.”
Asha
set
the
collar
on
her
head
at
a
jaunty
angle,
so
the
gold
gleamed
against
her
dark
hair.
“Balon’s
brother
cannot
come
before
Balon’s
son!”

“Balon’s
sons
are
dead,”
cried
Ralf
the
Limper.
“All
I
see
is
Balon’s
little
daughter!”

“Daughter?”
Asha
slipped
a
hand
beneath
her
jerkin.
“Oho!
What’s
this?
Shall
I
show
you?
Some
of
you
have
not
seen
one
since
they
weaned
you.”
They
laughed
again.
“Teats
on
a
king
are
a
terrible
thing,
is
that
the
song?
Ralf,
you
have
me,
I
am
a
woman...
though
not
an
old
woman
like
you.
Ralf
the
Limper...
shouldn’t
that
be
Ralf
the
Limp?”
Asha
drew
a
dirk
from
between
her
breasts.
“I’m
a
mother
too,
and
here’s
my
suckling
babe!”
She
held
it
up.
“And
here,
my
champions.”
They
pushed
past
Victarion’s
three
to
stand
below
her:
Qarl
the
Maid,
Tristifer
Botley,
and
the
knight
Ser
Harras
Harlaw,
whose
sword
Nightfall
was
as
storied
as
Dunstan
Drumm’s
Red
Rain.
“My
nuncle
said
you
know
him.
You
know
me
too—”

“I
want
to
know
you
better!”
someone
shouted.

“Go
home
and
know
your
wife,”
Asha
shot
back.
“Nuncle
says
he’ll
give
you
more
of
what
my
father
gave
you.
Well,
what
was
that?
Gold
and
glory,
some
will
say.
Freedom,
ever
sweet.
Aye,
it’s
so,
he
gave
us
that...
and
widows
too,
as
Lord
Blacktyde
will
tell
you.
How
many
of
you
had
your
homes
put
to
the
torch
when
Robert
came?
How
many
had
daughters
raped
and
despoiled?
Burnt
towns
and
broken
castles,
my
father
gave
you
that.
Defeat
was
what
he
gave
you.
Nuncle
here
will
give
you
more.
Not
me.”

“What
will
you
give
us?”
asked
Lucas
Codd.
“Knitting?”

“Aye,
Lucas.
I’ll
knit
us
all
a
kingdom.”
She
tossed
her
dirk
from
hand
to
hand.
“We
need
to
take
a
lesson
from
the
Young
Wolf,
who
won
every
battle...
and
lost
all.”

“A
wolf
is
not
a
kraken,”
Victarion
objected.
“What
the
kraken
grasps
it
does
not
lose,
be
it
longship
or
leviathan.”

“And
what
have
we
grasped,
Nuncle?
The
north?
What
is
that,
but
leagues
and
leagues
of
leagues
and
leagues,
far
from
the
sound
of
the
sea?
We
have
taken
Moat
Cailin,
Deepwood
Motte,
Torrhen’s
Square,
even
Winterfell.
What
do
we
have
to
show
for
it?”
She
beckoned,
and
her
Black
Wind
men
pushed
forward,
chests
of
oak
and
iron
on
their
shoulders.
“I
give
you
the
wealth
of
the
Stony
Shore,”
Asha
said
as
the
first
was
upended.
An
avalanche
of
pebbles
clattered
forth,
cascading
down
the
steps;
pebbles
grey
and
black
and
white,
worn
smooth
by
the
sea.
“I
give
you
the
riches
of
Deepwood,”
she
said,
as
the
second
chest
was
opened.
Pinecones
came
pouring
out,
to
roll
and
bounce
down
into
the
crowd.
“And
last,
the
gold
of
Winterfell.”
From
the
third
chest
came
yellow
turnips,
round
and
hard
and
big
as
a
man’s
head.
They
landed
amidst
the
pebbles
and
the
pinecones.
Asha
stabbed
one
with
her
dirk.
“Harmund
Sharp,”
she
shouted,
“your
son
Harrag
died
at
Winterfell,
for
this.”
She
pulled
the
turnip
off
her
blade
and
tossed
it
to
him.
“You
have
other
sons,
I
think.
If
you’d
trade
their
lives
for
turnips,
shout
my
nuncle’s
name!”

“And
if
I
shout
your
name?”
Harmund
demanded.
“What
then?”

“Peace,”
said
Asha.
“Land.
Victory.
I’ll
give
you
Sea
Dragon
Point
and
the
Stony
Shore,
black
earth
and
tall
trees
and
stones
enough
for
every
younger
son
to
build
a
hall.
We’ll
have
the
northmen
too...
as
friends,
to
stand
with
us
against
the
Iron
Throne.
Your
choice
is
simple.
Crown
me,
for
peace
and
victory.
Or
crown
my
nuncle,
for
more
war
and
more
defeat.”
She
sheathed
her
dirk
again.
“What
will
you
have,
ironmen?”

“VICTORY!”
shouted
Rodrik
the
Reader,
his
hands
cupped
about
his
mouth.
“Victory,
and
Asha!”

“ASHA!”
Lord
Baelor
Blacktyde
echoed.
“ASHA
QUEEN!”

Asha’s
own
crew
took
up
the
cry.
“ASHA!
ASHA!
ASHA
QUEEN!”
They
stamped
their
feet
and
shook
their
fists
and
yelled,
as
the
Damphair
listened
in
disbelief.
She
would
leave
her
father’s
work
undone!
Yet
Tristifer
Botley
was
shouting
for
her,
with
many
Harlaws,
some
Goodbrothers,
red-faced
Lord
Merlyn,
more
men
than
the
priest
would
ever
have
believed...
for
a
woman!

But
others
were
holding
their
tongues,
or
muttering
asides
to
their
neighbors.
“No
craven’s
peace!”
Ralf
the
Limper
roared.
Red
Ralf
Stonehouse
swirled
the
Greyjoy
banner
and
bellowed,
“Victarion!
VICTARION!
VICTARION!”
Men
began
to
shove
at
one
another.
Someone
flung
a
pinecone
at
Asha’s
head.
When
she
ducked,
her
makeshift
crown
fell
off.
For
a
moment
it
seemed
to
the
priest
as
if
he
stood
atop
a
giant
anthill,
with
a
thousand
ants
in
a
boil
at
his
feet.
Shouts
of
“Asha!”
and
“Victarion!”
surged
back
and
forth,
and
it
seemed
as
though
some
savage
storm
was
about
to
engulf
them
all.
The
Storm
God
is
amongst
us,
the
priest
thought,
sowing
fury
and
discord.

Sharp
as
a
swordthrust,
the
sound
of
a
horn
split
the
air.

Bright
and
baneful
was
its
voice,
a
shivering
hot
scream
that
made
a
man’s
bones
seem
to
thrum
within
him.
The
cry
lingered
in
the
damp
sea
air:
aaaaRREEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

All
eyes
turned
toward
the
sound.
It
was
one
of
Euron’s
mongrels
winding
the
call,
a
monstrous
man
with
a
shaved
head.
Rings
of
gold
and
jade
and
jet
glistened
on
his
arms,
and
on
his
broad
chest
was
tattooed
some
bird
of
prey,
talons
dripping
blood.

aaaaRRREEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

The
horn
he
blew
was
shiny
black
and
twisted,
and
taller
than
a
man
as
he
held
it
with
both
hands.
It
was
bound
about
with
bands
of
red
gold
and
dark
steel,
incised
with
ancient
Valyrian
glyphs
that
seemed
to
glow
redly
as
the
sound
swelled.

aaaaaaaRRREEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

It
was
a
terrible
sound,
a
wail
of
pain
and
fury
that
seemed
to
burn
the
ears.
Aeron
Damphair
covered
his,
and
prayed
for
the
Drowned
God
to
raise
a
mighty
wave
and
smash
the
horn
to
silence,
yet
still
the
shriek
went
on
and
on.
It
is
the
horn
of
hell,
he
wanted
to
scream,
though
no
man
would
have
heard
him.
The
cheeks
of
the
tattooed
man
were
so
puffed
out
they
looked
about
to
burst,
and
the
muscles
in
his
chest
twitched
in
a
way
that
it
made
it
seem
as
if
the
bird
were
about
to
rip
free
of
his
flesh
and
take
wing.
And
now
the
glyphs
were
burning
brightly,
every
line
and
letter
shimmering
with
white
fire.
On
and
on
and
on
the
sound
went,
echoing
amongst
the
howling
hills
behind
them
and
across
the
waters
of
Nagga’s
Cradle
to
ring
against
the
mountains
of
Great
Wyk,
on
and
on
and
on
until
it
filled
the
whole
wet
world.

And
when
it
seemed
the
sound
would
never
end,
it
did.

The
hornblower’s
breath
failed
at
last.
He
staggered
and
almost
fell.
The
priest
saw
Orkwood
of
Orkmont
catch
him
by
one
arm
to
hold
him
up,
whilst
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd
took
the
twisted
black
horn
from
his
hands.
A
thin
wisp
of
smoke
was
rising
from
the
horn,
and
the
priest
saw
blood
and
blisters
upon
the
lips
of
the
man
who’d
sounded
it.
The
bird
on
his
chest
was
bleeding
too.

Euron
Greyjoy
climbed
the
hill
slowly,
with
every
eye
upon
him.
Above
the
gull
screamed
and
screamed
again.
No
godless
man
may
sit
the
Seastone
Chair,
Aeron
thought,
but
he
knew
that
he
must
let
his
brother
speak.
His
lips
moved
silently
in
prayer.

Asha’s
champions
stepped
aside,
and
Victarion’s
as
well.
The
priest
took
a
step
backward
and
put
one
hand
upon
the
cold
rough
stone
of
Nagga’s
ribs.
The
Crow’s
Eye
stopped
atop
the
steps,
at
the
doors
of
the
Grey
King’s
Hall,
and
turned
his
smiling
eye
upon
the
captains
and
the
kings,
but
Aeron
could
feel
his
other
eye
as
well,
the
one
that
he
kept
hidden.

“IRONMEN,”
said
Euron
Greyjoy,
“you
have
heard
my
horn.
Now
hear
my
words.
I
am
Balon’s
brother,
Quellon’s
eldest
living
son.
Lord
Vickon’s
blood
is
in
my
veins,
and
the
blood
of
the
Old
Kraken.
Yet
I
have
sailed
farther
than
any
of
them.
Only
one
living
kraken
has
never
known
defeat.
Only
one
has
never
bent
his
knee.
Only
one
has
sailed
to
Asshai
by
the
Shadow,
and
seen
wonders
and
terrors
beyond
imagining...”

“If
you
liked
the
Shadow
so
well,
go
back
there,”
called
out
pink-cheeked
Qarl
the
Maid,
one
of
Asha’s
champions.

The
Crow’s
Eye
ignored
him.
“My
little
brother
would
finish
Balon’s
war,
and
claim
the
north.
My
sweet
niece
would
give
us
peace
and
pinecones.”
His
blue
lips
twisted
in
a
smile.
“Asha
prefers
victory
to
defeat.
Victarion
wants
a
kingdom,
not
a
few
scant
yards
of
earth.
From
me,
you
shall
have
both.

“Crow’s
Eye,
you
call
me.
Well,
who
has
a
keener
eye
than
the
crow?
After
every
battle
the
crows
come
in
their
hundreds
and
their
thousands
to
feast
upon
the
fallen.
A
crow
can
espy
death
from
afar.
And
I
say
that
all
of
Westeros
is
dying.
Those
who
follow
me
will
feast
until
the
end
of
their
days.

“We
are
the
ironborn,
and
once
we
were
conquerors.
Our
writ
ran
everywhere
the
sound
of
the
waves
was
heard.
My
brother
would
have
you
be
content
with
the
cold
and
dismal
north,
my
niece
with
even
less...
but
I
shall
give
you
Lannisport.
Highgarden.
The
Arbor.
Oldtown.
The
riverlands
and
the
Reach,
the
kingswood
and
the
rainwood,
Dorne
and
the
marches,
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
and
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
Tarth
and
the
Stepstones.
I
say
we
take
it
all!
I
say,
we
take
Westeros.”
He
glanced
at
the
priest.
“All
for
the
greater
glory
of
our
Drowned
God,
to
be
sure.”

For
half
a
heartbeat
even
Aeron
was
swept
away
by
the
boldness
of
his
words.
The
priest
had
dreamed
the
same
dream,
when
first
he’d
seen
the
red
comet
in
the
sky.
We
shall
sweep
over
the
green
lands
with
fire
and
sword,
root
out
the
seven
gods
of
the
septons
and
the
white
trees
of
the
northmen...

“Crow’s
Eye,”
Asha
called,
“did
you
leave
your
wits
at
Asshai?
If
we
cannot
hold
the
north—and
we
cannot—how
can
we
win
the
whole
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms?”

“Why,
it
has
been
done
before.
Did
Balon
teach
his
girl
so
little
of
the
ways
of
war?
Victarion,
our
brother’s
daughter
has
never
heard
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror,
it
would
seem.”

“Aegon?”
Victarion
crossed
his
arms
against
his
armored
chest.
“What
has
the
Conqueror
to
do
with
us?”

“I
know
as
much
of
war
as
you
do,
Crow’s
Eye,”
Asha
said.
“Aegon
Targaryen
conquered
Westeros
with
dragons.”

“And
so
shall
we,”
Euron
Greyjoy
promised.
“That
horn
you
heard
I
found
amongst
the
smoking
ruins
that
were
Valyria,
where
no
man
has
dared
to
walk
but
me.
You
heard
its
call,
and
felt
its
power.
It
is
a
dragon
horn,
bound
with
bands
of
red
gold
and
Valyrian
steel
graven
with
enchantments.
The
dragonlords
of
old
sounded
such
horns,
before
the
Doom
devoured
them.
With
this
horn,
ironmen,
I
can
bind
dragons
to
my
will.”

Asha
laughed
aloud.
“A
horn
to
bind
goats
to
your
will
would
be
of
more
use,
Crow’s
Eye.
There
are
no
more
dragons.”

“Again,
girl,
you
are
wrong.
There
are
three,
and
I
know
where
to
find
them.
Surely
that
is
worth
a
driftwood
crown.”

“EURON!”
shouted
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd.

“EURON!
CROW’S
EYE!
EURON!”
cried
the
Red
Oarsman.

The
mutes
and
mongrels
from
the
Silence
threw
open
Euron’s
chests
and
spilled
out
his
gifts
before
the
captains
and
the
kings.
Then
it
was
Hotho
Harlaw
the
priest
heard,
as
he
filled
his
hands
with
gold.
Gorold
Goodbrother
shouted
out
as
well,
and
Erik
Anvil-Breaker.
“EURON!
EURON!
EURON!”
The
cry
swelled,
became
a
roar.
“EURON!
EURON!
CROW’S
EYE!
EURON
KING!”
It
rolled
up
Nagga’s
hill,
like
the
Storm
God
rattling
the
clouds.
“EURON!
EURON!
EURON!
EURON!
EURON!
EURON!”

Even
a
priest
may
doubt.
Even
a
prophet
may
know
terror.
Aeron
Damphair
reached
within
himself
for
his
god
and
discovered
only
silence.
As
a
thousand
voices
shouted
out
his
brother’s
name,
all
he
could
hear
was
the
scream
of
a
rusted
iron
hinge.





BRIENNE

East
of
Maidenpool
the
hills
rose
wild,
and
the
pines
closed
in
about
them
like
a
host
of
silent
grey-green
soldiers.

Nimble
Dick
said
the
coast
road
was
the
shortest
way,
and
the
easiest,
so
they
were
seldom
out
of
sight
of
the
bay.
The
towns
and
villages
along
the
shore
grew
smaller
as
they
went,
and
less
frequent.
At
nightfall
they
would
seek
an
inn.
Crabb
would
share
the
common
bed
with
other
travelers,
whilst
Brienne
took
a
room
for
her
and
Podrick.
“Cheaper
if
we
all
shared
the
same
bed,
m’lady,”
Nimble
Dick
would
say.
“You
could
lay
your
sword
between
us.
Old
Dick’s
a
harmless
fellow.
Chivalrous
as
a
knight,
and
honest
as
the
day
is
long.”

“The
days
are
growing
shorter,”
Brienne
pointed
out.

“Well,
that
may
be.
If
you
don’t
trust
me
in
the
bed,
I
could
just
curl
up
on
the
floor,
m’lady.”

“Not
on
my
floor.”

“A
man
might
think
you
don’t
trust
me
none.”

“Trust
is
earned.
Like
gold.”

“As
you
say,
m’lady,”
said
Crabb,
“but
up
north
where
the
road
gives
out,
you’ll
need
t’
trust
Dick
then.
If
I
wanted
t’
take
your
gold
at
swordpoint,
who’s
to
stop
me?”

“You
don’t
own
a
sword.
I
do.”

She
shut
the
door
between
them
and
stood
there
listening
until
she
was
certain
he
had
moved
away.
However
nimble
he
might
be,
Dick
Crabb
was
no
Jaime
Lannister,
no
Mad
Mouse,
not
even
a
Humfrey
Wagstaff.
He
was
scrawny
and
ill
fed,
his
only
armor
a
dinted
halfhelm
spotted
with
rust.
In
place
of
a
sword,
he
carried
an
old,
nicked
dagger.
So
long
as
she
was
awake,
he
posed
no
danger
to
her.
“Podrick,”
she
said,
“there
will
come
a
time
when
there
are
no
more
inns
to
shelter
us.
I
do
not
trust
our
guide.
When
we
make
camp,
can
you
watch
over
me
as
I
sleep?”

“Stay
awake,
my
lady?
Ser.”
He
thought.
“I
have
a
sword.
If
Crabb
tries
to
hurt
you,
I
could
kill
him.”

“No,”
she
said
sternly.
“You
are
not
to
try
and
fight
him.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
watch
him
as
I
sleep,
and
wake
me
if
he
does
anything
suspicious.
I
wake
quickly,
you
will
find.”

Crabb
showed
his
true
colors
the
next
day,
when
they
stopped
to
water
the
horses.
Brienne
had
to
step
behind
some
bushes
to
empty
her
bladder.
As
she
was
squatting,
she
heard
Podrick
say,
“What
are
you
doing?
You
get
away
from
there.”
She
finished
her
business,
hiked
up
her
breeches,
and
returned
to
the
road
to
find
Nimble
Dick
wiping
flour
off
his
fingers.
“You
won’t
find
any
dragons
in
my
saddlebags,”
she
told
him.
“I
keep
my
gold
upon
my
person.”
Some
of
it
was
in
the
pouch
at
her
belt,
the
rest
hidden
in
a
pair
of
pockets
sewn
inside
her
clothing.
The
fat
purse
inside
her
saddlebag
was
filled
with
coppers
large
and
small,
pennies
and
halfpennies,
groats
and
stars...
and
fine
white
flour,
to
make
it
fatter
still.
She
had
bought
the
flour
from
the
cook
at
the
Seven
Swords
the
morning
she
rode
out
from
Duskendale.

“Dick
meant
no
harm,
m’lady.”
He
wriggled
his
flour-spotted
fingers
to
show
he
held
no
weapon.
“I
was
only
looking
to
see
if
you
had
these
dragons
what
you
promised
me.
The
world’s
full
o’
liars,
ready
to
cheat
an
honest
man.
Not
that
you’re
one.”

Brienne
hoped
he
was
a
better
guide
than
he
was
a
thief.
“We
had
best
be
going.”
She
mounted
up
again.

Dick
would
oft
sing
as
they
rode
along
together;
never
a
whole
song,
only
a
snatch
of
this
and
a
verse
of
that.
She
suspected
that
he
meant
to
charm
her,
to
put
her
off
her
guard.
Sometimes
he
would
try
to
get
her
and
Podrick
to
sing
along
with
him,
to
no
avail.
The
boy
was
too
shy
and
tongue-tied,
and
Brienne
did
not
sing.
Did
you
sing
for
your
father?
Lady
Stark
had
asked
her
once,
at
Riverrun.
Did
you
sing
for
Renly?
She
had
not,
not
ever,
though
she
had
wanted...
she
had
wanted...

When
he
was
not
singing,
Nimble
Dick
would
talk,
regaling
them
with
tales
of
Crackclaw
Point.
Every
gloomy
valley
had
its
lord,
he
said,
the
lot
of
them
united
only
by
their
mistrust
of
outsiders.
In
their
veins
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
ran
dark
and
strong.
“The
Andals
tried
t’
take
Crackclaw,
but
we
bled
them
in
the
valleys
and
drowned
them
in
the
bogs.
Only
what
their
sons
couldn’t
win
with
swords,
their
pretty
daughters
won
with
kisses.
They
married
into
the
houses
they
couldn’t
conquer,
aye.”

The
Darklyn
kings
of
Duskendale
had
tried
to
impose
their
rule
on
Crackclaw
Point;
the
Mootons
of
Maidenpool
had
tried
as
well,
and
later
the
haughty
Celtigars
of
Crab
Isle.
But
the
Crackclaws
knew
their
bogs
and
forests
as
no
outsider
could,
and
if
hard
pressed
would
vanish
into
the
caverns
that
honeycombed
their
hills.
When
not
fighting
would-be
conquerors,
they
fought
each
other.
Their
blood
feuds
were
as
deep
and
dark
as
the
bogs
between
their
hills.
From
time
to
time
some
champion
would
bring
peace
to
the
Point,
but
it
never
lasted
longer
than
his
lifetime.
Lord
Lucifer
Hardy,
he
was
a
great
one,
and
the
Brothers
Brune
as
well.
Old
Crackbones
even
more
so,
but
the
Crabbs
were
the
mightiest
of
all.
Dick
still
refused
to
believe
that
Brienne
had
never
heard
of
Ser
Clarence
Crabb
and
his
exploits.

“Why
would
I
lie?”
she
asked
him.
“Every
place
has
its
local
heroes.
Where
I
come
from,
the
singers
sing
of
Ser
Galladon
of
Morne,
the
Perfect
Knight.”

“Ser
Gallawho
of
What?”
He
snorted.
“Never
heard
o’
him.
Why
was
he
so
bloody
perfect?”

“Ser
Galladon
was
a
champion
of
such
valor
that
the
Maiden
herself
lost
her
heart
to
him.
She
gave
him
an
enchanted
sword
as
a
token
of
her
love.
The
Just
Maid,
it
was
called.
No
common
sword
could
check
her,
nor
any
shield
withstand
her
kiss.
Ser
Galladon
bore
the
Just
Maid
proudly,
but
only
thrice
did
he
unsheathe
her.
He
would
not
use
the
Maid
against
a
mortal
man,
for
she
was
so
potent
as
to
make
any
fight
unfair.”

Crabb
thought
that
was
hilarious.
“The
Perfect
Knight?
The
Perfect
Fool,
he
sounds
like.
What’s
the
point
o’
having
some
magic
sword
if
you
don’t
bloody
well
use
it?”

“Honor,”
she
said.
“The
point
is
honor.”

That
only
made
him
laugh
the
louder.
“Ser
Clarence
Crabb
would
have
wiped
his
hairy
arse
with
your
Perfect
Knight,
m’lady.
If
they’d
ever
have
met,
there’d
be
one
more
bloody
head
sitting
on
the
shelf
at
the
Whispers,
you
ask
me.
‘I
should
have
used
the
magic
sword,’
it’d
be
saying
to
all
the
other
heads.
‘I
should
have
used
the
bloody
sword.’”

Brienne
could
not
help
but
smile.
“Perhaps,”
she
allowed,
“but
Ser
Galladon
was
no
fool.
Against
a
foe
eight
feet
tall
mounted
on
an
aurochs,
he
might
well
have
unsheathed
the
Just
Maid.
He
used
her
once
to
slay
a
dragon,
they
say.”

Nimble
Dick
was
unimpressed.
“Crackbones
fought
a
dragon
too,
but
he
didn’t
need
no
magic
sword.
He
just
tied
its
neck
in
a
knot,
so
every
time
it
breathed
fire
it
roasted
its
own
arse.”

“And
what
did
Crackbones
do
when
Aegon
and
his
sisters
came?”
Brienne
asked
him.

“He
was
dead.
M’lady
must
know
that.”
Crabb
gave
her
a
sideways
look.
“Aegon
sent
his
sister
up
to
Crackclaw,
that
Visenya.
The
lords
had
heard
o’
Harren’s
end.
Being
no
fools,
they
laid
their
swords
at
her
feet.
The
queen
took
them
as
her
own
men,
and
said
they’d
owe
no
fealty
to
Maidenpool,
Crab
Isle,
or
Duskendale.
Don’t
stop
them
bloody
Celtigars
from
sending
men
to
t’
eastern
shore
to
collect
his
taxes.
If
he
sends
enough,
a
few
come
back
to
him...
elsewise,
we
bow
only
to
our
own
lords,
and
the
king.
The
true
king,
not
Robert
and
his
ilk.”
He
spat.
“There
was
Crabbs
and
Brunes
and
Boggses
with
Prince
Rhaegar
on
the
Trident,
and
in
the
Kingsguard
too.
A
Hardy,
a
Cave,
a
Pyne,
and
three
Crabbs,
Clement
and
Rupert
and
Clarence
the
Short.
Six
foot
tall,
he
was,
but
short
compared
to
the
real
Ser
Clarence.
We’re
all
good
dragon
men,
up
Crackclaw
way.”

The
traffic
continued
to
dwindle
as
they
moved
north
and
east,
until
finally
there
were
no
inns
to
be
found.
By
then
the
bayside
road
was
more
weeds
than
ruts.
That
night
they
took
shelter
in
a
fishing
village.
Brienne
paid
the
villagers
a
few
coppers
to
allow
them
to
bed
down
in
a
hay
barn.
She
claimed
the
loft
for
Podrick
and
herself,
and
pulled
the
ladder
up
after
them.

“You
leave
me
down
here
alone,
I
could
bloody
well
steal
your
horses,”
Crabb
called
up
from
below.
“Best
you
get
them
up
the
ladder
too,
m’lady.”
When
she
ignored
him,
he
went
on
to
say,
“It’s
going
to
rain
tonight.
A
cold
hard
rain.
You
and
Pods
will
sleep
all
snug
and
warm,
and
poor
old
Dick
will
be
shivering
down
here
by
myself.”
He
shook
his
head,
muttering,
as
he
made
a
bed
on
a
pile
of
hay.
“I
never
knew
such
a
mistrustful
maid
as
you.”

Brienne
curled
up
beneath
her
cloak,
with
Podrick
yawning
at
her
side.
I
was
not
always
wary,
she
might
have
shouted
down
at
Crabb.
When
I
was
a
little
girl
I
believed
that
all
men
were
as
noble
as
my
father.
Even
the
men
who
told
her
what
a
pretty
girl
she
was,
how
tall
and
bright
and
clever,
how
graceful
when
she
danced.
It
was
Septa
Roelle
who
had
lifted
the
scales
from
her
eyes.
“They
only
say
those
things
to
win
your
lord
father’s
favor,”
the
woman
had
said.
“You’ll
find
truth
in
your
looking
glass,
not
on
the
tongues
of
men.”
It
was
a
harsh
lesson,
one
that
left
her
weeping,
but
it
had
stood
her
in
good
stead
at
Harrenhal
when
Ser
Hyle
and
his
friends
had
played
their
game.
A
maid
has
to
be
mistrustful
in
this
world,
or
she
will
not
be
a
maid
for
long,
she
was
thinking,
as
the
rain
began
to
fall.

In
the
mêlée
at
Bitterbridge
she
had
sought
out
her
suitors
and
battered
them
one
by
one,
Farrow
and
Ambrose
and
Bushy,
Mark
Mullendore
and
Raymond
Nayland
and
Will
the
Stork.
She
had
ridden
over
Harry
Sawyer
and
broken
Robin
Potter’s
helm,
giving
him
a
nasty
scar.
And
when
the
last
of
them
had
fallen,
the
Mother
had
delivered
Connington
to
her.
This
time
Ser
Ronnet
held
a
sword
and
not
a
rose.
Every
blow
she
dealt
him
was
sweeter
than
a
kiss.

Loras
Tyrell
had
been
the
last
to
face
her
wroth
that
day.
He’d
never
courted
her,
had
hardly
looked
at
her
at
all,
but
he
bore
three
golden
roses
on
his
shield
that
day,
and
Brienne
hated
roses.
The
sight
of
them
had
given
her
a
furious
strength.
She
went
to
sleep
dreaming
of
the
fight
they’d
had,
and
of
Ser
Jaime
fastening
a
rainbow
cloak
about
her
shoulders.

It
was
still
raining
the
next
morning.
As
they
broke
their
fast,
Nimble
Dick
suggested
that
they
wait
for
it
to
stop.

“When
will
that
be?
On
the
morrow?
In
a
fortnight?
When
summer
comes
again?
No.
We
have
cloaks,
and
leagues
to
ride.”

It
rained
all
that
day.
The
narrow
track
they
followed
soon
turned
to
mud
beneath
them.
What
trees
they
saw
were
naked,
and
the
steady
rain
had
turned
their
fallen
leaves
into
a
sodden
brown
mat.
Despite
its
squirrel-skin
lining,
Dick’s
cloak
soaked
through,
and
she
could
see
him
shivering.
Brienne
felt
a
moment’s
pity
for
the
man.
He
has
not
eaten
well,
that’s
plain.
She
wondered
if
there
truly
was
a
smugglers’
cove,
or
a
ruined
castle
called
the
Whispers.
Hungry
men
do
desperate
things.
This
all
might
be
some
ploy
to
cozen
her.
Suspicion
soured
her
stomach.

For
a
time
it
seemed
as
though
the
steady
wash
of
rain
was
the
only
sound
in
the
world.
Nimble
Dick
plowed
on,
heedless.
She
watched
closely,
noting
how
he
bent
his
back,
as
if
huddling
low
in
the
saddle
would
keep
him
dry.
This
time
there
was
no
village
close
at
hand
when
darkness
came
upon
them.
Nor
were
there
any
trees
to
give
them
shelter.
They
were
forced
to
camp
amongst
some
rocks,
fifty
yards
above
the
tideline.
The
rocks
at
least
would
keep
the
wind
off.
“Best
we
keep
a
watch
tonight,
m’lady,”
Crabb
told
her,
as
she
was
struggling
to
get
a
driftwood
fire
lit.
“A
place
like
this,
there
might
be
squishers.”

“Squishers?”
Brienne
gave
him
a
suspicious
look.

“Monsters,”
Nimble
Dick
said,
with
relish.
“They
look
like
men
till
you
get
close,
but
their
heads
is
too
big,
and
they
got
scales
where
a
proper
man’s
got
hair.
Fish-belly
white
they
are,
with
webs
between
their
fingers.
They’re
always
damp
and
fishy-smelling,
but
behind
these
blubbery
lips
they
got
rows
of
green
teeth
sharp
as
needles.
Some
say
the
First
Men
killed
them
all,
but
don’t
you
believe
it.
They
come
by
night
and
steal
bad
little
children,
padding
along
on
them
webbed
feet
with
a
little
squish-squish
sound.
The
girls
they
keep
to
breed
with,
but
the
boys
they
eat,
tearing
at
them
with
those
sharp
green
teeth.”
He
grinned
at
Podrick.
“They’d
eat
you,
boy.
They’d
eat
you
raw.”

“If
they
try,
I’ll
kill
them.”
Podrick
touched
his
sword.

“You
try
that.
You
just
try.
Squishers
don’t
die
easy.”
He
winked
at
Brienne.
“You
a
bad
little
girl,
m’lady?”

“No.”
Just
a
fool.
The
wood
was
too
damp
to
light,
no
matter
how
many
sparks
Brienne
struck
off
her
flint
and
steel.
The
kindling
sent
up
some
smoke,
but
that
was
all.
Disgusted,
she
settled
down
with
her
back
to
a
rock,
pulled
her
cloak
over
herself,
and
resigned
herself
to
a
cold,
wet
night.
Dreaming
of
a
hot
meal,
she
gnawed
on
a
strip
of
hard
salt
beef
whilst
Nimble
Dick
talked
about
the
time
Ser
Clarence
Crabb
had
fought
the
squisher
king.
He
tells
a
lively
tale,
she
had
to
admit,
but
Mark
Mullendore
was
amusing
too,
with
his
little
monkey.

It
was
too
wet
to
see
the
sun
go
down,
too
grey
to
see
the
moon
come
up.
The
night
was
black
and
starless.
Crabb
ran
out
of
tales
and
went
to
sleep.
Podrick
was
soon
snoring
too.
Brienne
sat
with
her
back
to
the
rock,
listening
to
the
waves.
Are
you
near
the
sea,
Sansa?
she
wondered.
Are
you
waiting
at
the
Whispers
for
a
ship
that
will
never
come?
Who
do
you
have
with
you?
Passage
for
three,
he
said.
Has
the
Imp
joined
you
and
Ser
Dontos,
or
did
you
find
your
little
sister?

The
day
had
been
a
long
one,
and
Brienne
was
tired.
Even
sitting
up
against
the
rock,
with
rain
pattering
softly
all
around
her,
she
found
her
eyelids
growing
heavy.
Twice
she
dozed.
The
second
time
she
woke
all
at
once,
heart
pounding,
convinced
that
someone
was
looming
over
her.
Her
limbs
were
stiff,
and
her
cloak
had
gotten
tangled
round
her
ankles.
She
kicked
free
of
it
and
stood.
Nimble
Dick
was
curled
against
a
rock,
half-buried
in
wet,
heavy
sand,
asleep.
A
dream.
It
was
a
dream.

Perhaps
she
had
made
a
mistake
in
abandoning
Ser
Creighton
and
Ser
Illifer.
They
had
seemed
like
honest
men.
Would
that
Jaime
had
come
with
me,
she
thought...
but
he
was
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard,
his
rightful
place
was
with
his
king.
Besides,
it
was
Renly
that
she
wanted.
I
swore
I
would
protect
him,
and
I
failed.
Then
I
swore
I
would
avenge
him,
and
I
failed
at
that
as
well.
I
ran
off
with
Lady
Catelyn
instead,
and
failed
her
too.
The
wind
had
shifted,
and
the
rain
was
running
down
her
face.

The
next
day
the
road
dwindled
to
a
pebbled
thread,
and
finally
to
a
mere
suggestion.
Near
midday,
it
came
to
an
abrupt
end
at
the
foot
of
a
wind-carved
cliff.
Above,
a
small
castle
stood
frowning
over
the
waves,
its
three
crooked
towers
outlined
against
a
leaden
sky.
“Is
that
the
Whispers?”
Podrick
asked.

“That
look
a
bloody
ruin
t’
you?”
Crabb
spat.
“That’s
the
Dyre
Den,
where
old
Lord
Brune
keeps
his
seat.
Road
ends
here,
though.
It’s
the
pines
for
us
from
here
on.”

Brienne
studied
the
cliff.
“How
do
we
get
up
there?”

“Easy.”
Nimble
Dick
turned
his
horse.
“Stay
close
t’
Dick.
The
squishers
are
apt
t’
take
the
laggards.”

The
way
up
proved
to
be
a
steep
stony
path
hidden
within
a
cleft
in
the
rock.
Most
of
it
was
natural,
but
here
and
there
steps
had
been
carved
to
ease
the
climb.
Sheer
walls
of
rock,
eaten
away
by
centuries
of
wind
and
spray,
hemmed
them
in
to
either
side.
In
some
places
they
had
assumed
fantastic
shapes.
Nimble
Dick
pointed
out
a
few
as
they
climbed.
“There’s
an
ogre’s
head,
see?”
he
said,
and
Brienne
smiled
when
she
saw
it.
“And
that
there’s
a
stone
dragon.
T’other
wing
fell
off
when
my
father
was
a
boy.
Above
it,
that’s
the
dugs
drooping
down,
like
some
hag’s
teats.”
He
glanced
back
at
her
own
chest.

“Ser?
My
lady?”
said
Podrick.
“There’s
a
rider.”

“Where?”
None
of
the
rocks
suggested
a
rider
to
her.

“On
the
road.
Not
a
rock
rider.
A
real
rider.
Following
us.
Down
there.”
He
pointed.

Brienne
twisted
in
her
saddle.
They
had
climbed
high
enough
to
see
for
leagues
along
the
shore.
The
horse
was
coming
up
the
same
road
they
had
taken,
two
or
three
miles
behind
them.
Again?
She
glanced
at
Nimble
Dick
suspiciously.

“Don’t
squint
at
me,”
Crabb
said.
“He’s
naught
t’
do
with
old
Nimble
Dick,
whoever
he
is.
Some
man
o’
Brune’s,
most
like,
come
back
from
the
wars.
Or
one
o’
them
singers,
wandering
from
place
to
place.”
He
turned
his
head
and
spat.
“He’s
no
squisher,
that’s
bloody
certain.
Their
sort
don’t
ride
horses.”

“No,”
said
Brienne.
On
that,
at
least,
they
could
agree.

The
last
hundred
feet
of
the
climb
proved
the
steepest
and
most
treacherous.
Loose
pebbles
rolled
beneath
their
horse’s
hooves
and
went
rattling
down
the
stony
path
behind
them.
When
they
emerged
from
the
cleft
in
the
rock,
they
found
themselves
under
the
castle
walls.
On
a
parapet
above,
a
face
peered
down
at
them,
then
vanished.
Brienne
thought
it
might
have
been
a
woman,
and
said
as
much
to
Nimble
Dick.

He
agreed.
“Brune’s
too
old
to
go
climbing
wallwalks,
and
his
sons
and
grandsons
went
off
to
the
wars.
No
one
left
in
there
but
wenches,
and
a
snot-nosed
babe
or
three.”

It
was
on
her
lips
to
ask
her
guide
which
king
Lord
Brune
had
espoused,
but
it
made
no
matter
any
longer.
Brune’s
sons
were
gone;
some
might
not
be
coming
back.
We
will
have
no
hospitality
here
tonight.
A
castle
full
of
old
men,
women,
and
children
was
not
like
to
open
its
doors
to
armed
strangers.
“You
speak
of
Lord
Brune
as
if
you
know
him,”
she
said
to
Nimble
Dick.

“Might
be
I
did,
once.”

She
glanced
at
the
breast
of
his
doublet.
Loose
threads
and
a
ragged
patch
of
darker
fabric
showed
where
some
badge
had
been
torn
away.
Her
guide
was
a
deserter,
she
did
not
doubt.
Could
the
rider
behind
them
be
one
of
his
brothers-in-arms?

“We
should
ride
on,”
he
urged,
“before
Brune
starts
to
wonder
why
we’re
here
beneath
his
walls.
Even
a
wench
can
wind
a
bloody
crossbow.”
Dick
gestured
toward
the
limestone
hills
that
rose
beyond
the
castle,
with
their
wooded
slopes.
“No
more
roads
from
here
on,
only
streams
and
game
trails,
but
m’lady
need
not
fear.
Nimble
Dick
knows
these
parts.”

That
was
what
Brienne
was
afraid
of.
The
wind
was
gusting
along
the
top
of
the
cliff,
but
all
she
could
smell
was
a
trap.
“What
about
that
rider?”
Unless
his
horse
could
walk
on
waves,
he
would
soon
be
coming
up
the
cliff.

“What
about
him?
If
he’s
some
fool
from
Maidenpool,
he
might
not
even
find
the
bloody
path.
And
if
he
does,
we’ll
lose
him
in
the
woods.
He
won’t
have
no
road
to
follow
there.”

Only
our
tracks.
Brienne
wondered
if
it
wouldn’t
be
better
to
meet
the
rider
here,
with
her
blade
in
hand.
I’ll
look
an
utter
fool
if
it
is
a
wandering
singer
or
one
of
Lord
Brune’s
sons.
Crabb
had
the
right
of
it,
she
supposed.
If
he
is
still
behind
us
on
the
morrow,
I
can
deal
with
him
then.
“As
you
will,”
she
said,
turning
her
mare
toward
the
trees.

Lord
Brune’s
castle
dwindled
at
their
backs,
and
soon
was
lost
to
sight.
Sentinels
and
soldier
pines
rose
all
around
them,
towering
green-clad
spears
thrusting
toward
the
sky.
The
forest
floor
was
a
bed
of
fallen
needles
as
thick
as
a
castle
wall,
littered
with
pinecones.
The
hooves
of
their
horses
seemed
to
make
no
sound.
It
rained
a
bit,
stopped
for
a
time,
then
started
once
again,
but
amongst
the
pines
they
scarce
felt
a
drop.

The
going
was
much
slower
in
the
woods.
Brienne
prodded
her
mare
through
the
green
gloom,
weaving
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees.
It
would
be
very
easy
to
get
lost
here,
she
realized.
Every
way
she
looked
appeared
the
same.
The
very
air
seemed
grey
and
green
and
still.
Pine
boughs
scratched
against
her
arms
and
scraped
noisily
against
her
newly
painted
shield.
The
eerie
stillness
grated
on
her
more
with
every
passing
hour.

It
bothered
Nimble
Dick
as
well.
Late
that
day,
as
dusk
was
coming
on,
he
tried
to
sing.
“A
bear
there
was,
a
bear,
a
bear,
all
black
and
brown,
and
covered
with
hair,”
he
sang,
his
voice
as
scratchy
as
a
pair
of
woolen
breeches.
The
pines
drank
his
song,
as
they
drank
the
wind
and
rain.
After
a
little
while
he
stopped.

“It’s
bad
here,”
Podrick
said.
“This
is
a
bad
place.”

Brienne
felt
the
same,
but
it
would
not
serve
to
admit
it.
“A
pine
wood
is
a
gloomy
place,
but
in
the
end
it’s
just
a
wood.
There’s
naught
here
that
we
need
fear.”

“What
about
the
squishers?
And
the
heads?”

“There’s
a
clever
lad,”
said
Nimble
Dick,
laughing.

Brienne
gave
him
a
look
of
annoyance.
“There
are
no
squishers,”
she
told
Podrick,
“and
no
heads.”

The
hills
went
up,
the
hills
went
down.
Brienne
found
herself
praying
that
Nimble
Dick
was
honest,
and
knew
where
he
was
taking
them.
By
herself,
she
was
not
even
certain
she
could
have
found
the
sea
again.
Day
or
night,
the
sky
was
solid
grey
and
overcast,
with
neither
sun
nor
stars
to
help
her
find
her
way.

They
made
camp
early
that
night,
after
they
came
down
a
hill
and
found
themselves
on
the
edge
of
a
glistening
green
bog.
In
the
grey-green
light,
the
ground
ahead
looked
solid
enough,
but
when
they’d
ridden
out
it
had
swallowed
their
horses
up
to
their
withers.
They
had
to
turn
and
fight
their
way
back
onto
more
solid
footing.
“It’s
no
matter,”
Crabb
assured
them.
“We’ll
go
back
up
the
hill
and
come
down
another
way.”

The
next
day
was
the
same.
They
rode
through
pines
and
bogs,
under
dark
skies
and
intermittent
rain,
past
sinkholes
and
caves
and
the
ruins
of
ancient
strongholds
whose
stones
were
blanketed
in
moss.
Every
heap
of
stones
had
a
story,
and
Nimble
Dick
told
them
all.
To
hear
him
tell
it,
the
men
of
Crackclaw
Point
had
watered
their
pine
trees
with
blood.
Brienne’s
patience
soon
began
to
fray.
“How
much
longer?”
she
demanded
finally.
“We
must
have
seen
every
tree
in
Crackclaw
Point
by
now.”

“Not
hardly,”
said
Crabb.
“We’re
close
now.
See,
the
woods
is
thinning
out.
We’re
near
the
narrow
sea.”

This
fool
he
promised
me
is
like
to
be
my
own
reflection
in
a
pond,
Brienne
thought,
but
it
seemed
pointless
to
turn
back
when
she
had
come
so
far.
She
was
weary,
though,
she
could
not
deny
that.
Her
thighs
were
hard
as
iron
from
the
saddle,
and
of
late
she
had
been
sleeping
only
four
hours
a
night,
whilst
Podrick
watched
over
her.
If
Nimble
Dick
meant
to
try
and
murder
them,
she
was
convinced
it
would
happen
here,
on
ground
that
he
knew
well.
He
could
be
taking
them
to
some
robbers’
den
where
he
had
kin
as
treacherous
as
he
was.
Or
perhaps
he
was
just
leading
them
in
circles,
waiting
for
that
rider
to
catch
up.
They
had
not
seen
any
sign
of
the
man
since
leaving
Lord
Brune’s
castle,
but
that
did
not
mean
he
had
given
up
the
hunt.

It
may
be
that
I
will
need
to
kill
him,
she
told
herself
one
night
as
she
paced
about
the
camp.
The
notion
made
her
queasy.
Her
old
master-at-arms
had
always
questioned
whether
she
was
hard
enough
for
battle.
“You
have
a
man’s
strength
in
your
arms,”
Ser
Goodwin
had
said
to
her,
more
than
once,
“but
your
heart
is
as
soft
as
any
maid’s.
It
is
one
thing
to
train
in
the
yard
with
a
blunted
sword
in
hand,
and
another
to
drive
a
foot
of
sharpened
steel
into
a
man’s
gut
and
see
the
light
go
out
of
his
eyes.”
To
toughen
her,
Ser
Goodwin
used
to
send
her
to
her
father’s
butcher
to
slaughter
lambs
and
suckling
pigs.
The
piglets
squealed
and
the
lambs
screamed
like
frightened
children.
By
the
time
the
butchering
was
done
Brienne
had
been
blind
with
tears,
her
clothes
so
bloody
that
she
had
given
them
to
her
maid
to
burn.
But
Ser
Goodwin
still
had
doubts.
“A
piglet
is
a
piglet.
It
is
different
with
a
man.
When
I
was
a
squire
young
as
you,
I
had
a
friend
who
was
strong
and
quick
and
agile,
a
champion
in
the
yard.
We
all
knew
that
one
day
he
would
be
a
splendid
knight.
Then
war
came
to
the
Stepstones.
I
saw
my
friend
drive
his
foeman
to
his
knees
and
knock
the
axe
from
his
hand,
but
when
he
might
have
finished
he
held
back
for
half
a
heartbeat.
In
battle
half
a
heartbeat
is
a
lifetime.
The
man
slipped
out
his
dirk
and
found
a
chink
in
my
friend’s
armor.
His
strength,
his
speed,
his
valor,
all
his
hard-won
skill...
it
was
worth
less
than
a
mummer’s
fart,
because
he
flinched
from
killing.
Remember
that,
girl.”

I
will,
she
promised
his
shade,
there
in
the
piney
wood.
She
sat
down
on
a
rock,
took
out
her
sword,
and
began
to
hone
its
edge.
I
will
remember,
and
I
pray
I
will
not
flinch.

The
next
day
dawned
bleak
and
cold
and
overcast.
They
never
saw
the
sun
come
up,
but
when
the
blackness
turned
to
grey
Brienne
knew
it
was
time
to
saddle
up
again.
With
Nimble
Dick
leading
the
way,
they
rode
back
into
the
pines.
Brienne
followed
close
behind
him,
with
Podrick
bringing
up
the
rear
upon
his
rounsey.

The
castle
came
upon
them
without
warning.
One
moment
they
were
in
the
depths
of
the
forest,
with
nothing
but
pines
to
see
for
leagues
and
leagues.
Then
they
rode
around
a
boulder,
and
a
gap
appeared
ahead.
A
mile
farther
on,
the
forest
ended
abruptly.
Beyond
was
sky
and
sea...
and
an
ancient,
tumbledown
castle,
abandoned
and
overgrown
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff.
“The
Whispers,”
said
Nimble
Dick.
“Have
a
listen.
You
can
hear
the
heads.”

Podrick’s
mouth
gaped
open.
“I
hear
them.”

Brienne
heard
them
too.
A
faint,
soft
murmuring
that
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
ground
as
much
as
from
the
castle.
The
sound
grew
louder
as
she
neared
the
cliffs.
It
was
the
sea,
she
realized
suddenly.
The
waves
had
eaten
holes
in
the
cliffs
below
and
were
rumbling
through
caves
and
tunnels
beneath
the
earth.
“There
are
no
heads,”
she
said.
“It’s
the
waves
you
hear
whispering.”

“Waves
don’t
whisper.
It’s
heads.”

The
castle
was
built
of
old,
unmortared
stones,
no
two
the
same.
Moss
grew
thick
in
clefts
between
the
rocks,
and
trees
were
growing
up
from
the
foundations.
Most
old
castles
had
a
godswood.
By
the
look
of
it,
the
Whispers
had
little
else.
Brienne
walked
her
mare
to
the
cliff’s
edge,
where
the
curtain
wall
had
collapsed.
Mounds
of
poisonous
red
ivy
grew
over
the
heap
of
broken
stones.
She
tied
the
horse
to
a
tree
and
edged
as
close
to
the
precipice
as
she
dared.
Fifty
feet
below,
the
waves
were
swirling
in
and
over
the
remnants
of
a
shattered
tower.
Behind
it,
she
glimpsed
the
mouth
of
a
large
cavern.

“That’s
the
old
beacon
tower,”
said
Nimble
Dick
as
he
came
up
behind
her.
“It
fell
when
I
was
half
as
old
as
Pods
here.
Used
to
be
steps
down
to
the
cove,
but
when
the
cliff
collapsed
they
went
too.
The
smugglers
stopped
landing
here
after
that.
Time
was,
they
could
row
their
boats
into
the
cave,
but
no
more.
See?”
He
put
one
hand
on
her
back,
and
pointed
with
the
other.

Brienne’s
flesh
prickled.
One
shove,
and
I’ll
be
down
there
with
the
tower.
She
stepped
back.
“Keep
your
hands
off
me.”

Crabb
made
a
face.
“I
was
only...”

“I
don’t
care
what
you
were
only.
Where’s
the
gate?”

“Around
t’other
side.”
He
hesitated.
“This
fool
o’
yours,
he’s
not
a
man
to
hold
a
grudge,
is
he?”
he
said
nervously.
“I
mean,
last
night
I
got
to
thinking
that
he
might
be
angry
at
old
Nimble
Dick,
on
account
o’
that
map
I
sold
him,
and
how
I
left
out
that
the
smugglers
don’t
land
here
no
more.”

“With
the
gold
that
you’ve
got
coming,
you
can
give
him
back
whatever
he
paid
you
for
your
help.”
Brienne
could
not
imagine
Dontos
Hollard
posing
a
threat.
“That
is,
if
he’s
even
here.”

They
made
a
circuit
of
the
walls.
The
castle
had
been
triangular,
with
square
towers
at
each
corner.
Its
gates
were
badly
rotted.
When
Brienne
tugged
at
one,
the
wood
cracked
and
peeled
away
in
long
wet
splinters,
and
half
the
gate
came
down
on
her.
She
could
see
more
green
gloom
inside.
The
forest
had
breached
the
walls,
and
swallowed
keep
and
bailey.
But
there
was
a
portcullis
behind
the
gate,
its
teeth
sunk
deep
into
the
soft
muddy
ground.
The
iron
was
red
with
rust,
but
it
held
when
Brienne
rattled
it.
“No
one’s
used
this
gate
for
a
long
time.”

“I
could
climb
over,”
offered
Podrick.
“By
the
cliff.
Where
the
wall
fell
down.”

“It’s
too
dangerous.
Those
stones
looked
loose
to
me,
and
that
red
ivy’s
poisonous.
There
has
to
be
a
postern
gate.”

They
found
it
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle,
half-hidden
behind
a
huge
blackberry
bramble.
The
berries
had
all
been
picked,
and
half
the
bush
had
been
hacked
down
to
cut
a
path
to
the
door.
The
sight
of
the
broken
branches
filled
Brienne
with
disquiet.
“Someone’s
been
through
here,
and
recently.”

“Your
fool
and
those
girls,”
said
Crabb.
“I
told
you.”

Sansa?
Brienne
could
not
believe
it.
Even
a
wine-soaked
sot
like
Dontos
Hollard
would
have
better
sense
than
to
bring
her
to
this
bleak
place.
Something
about
the
ruins
filled
her
with
unease.
She
would
not
find
the
Stark
girl
here...
but
she
had
to
have
a
look.
Someone
was
here,
she
thought.
Someone
who
needed
to
stay
hidden.
“I’m
going
in,”
she
said.
“Crabb,
you’ll
come
with
me.
Podrick,
I
want
you
to
watch
the
horses.”

“I
want
to
come
too.
I’m
a
squire.
I
can
fight.”

“That’s
why
I
want
you
to
stay
here.
There
may
be
outlaws
in
these
woods.
We
dare
not
leave
the
horses
unprotected.”

Podrick
scuffed
at
a
rock
with
his
boot.
“As
you
say.”

She
shouldered
through
the
blackberries
and
pulled
at
a
rusted
iron
ring.
The
postern
door
resisted
for
a
moment,
then
jerked
open,
its
hinges
screaming
protest.
The
sound
made
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
Brienne’s
neck
stand
up.
She
drew
her
sword.
Even
in
mail
and
boiled
leather,
she
felt
naked.

“Go
on,
m’lady,”
urged
Nimble
Dick,
behind
her.
“What
are
you
waiting
for?
Old
Crabb’s
been
dead
a
thousand
years.”

What
was
she
waiting
for?
Brienne
told
herself
that
she
was
being
foolish.
The
sound
was
just
the
sea,
echoing
endlessly
through
the
caverns
beneath
the
castle,
rising
and
falling
with
each
wave.
It
did
sound
like
whispering,
though,
and
for
a
moment
she
could
almost
see
the
heads,
sitting
on
their
shelves
and
muttering
to
one
another.
“I
should
have
used
the
sword”
one
of
them
was
saying.
“I
should
have
used
the
magic
sword.”

“Podrick,”
said
Brienne.
“There’s
a
sword
and
scabbard
wrapped
up
in
my
bedroll.
Bring
them
here
to
me.”

“Yes,
ser.
My
lady.
I
will.”
The
boy
went
running
off.

“A
sword?”
Nimble
Dick
scratched
behind
his
ear.
“You
got
a
sword
in
your
hand.
What
do
you
need
another
for?”

“This
one’s
for
you.”
Brienne
offered
him
the
hilt.

“For
true?”
Crabb
reached
out
hesitantly,
as
if
the
blade
might
bite
him.
“The
mistrustful
maid’s
giving
old
Dick
a
sword?”

“You
do
know
how
to
use
one?”

“I’m
a
Crabb.”
He
snatched
the
longsword
from
her
hand.
“I
got
the
same
blood
as
old
Ser
Clarence.”
He
slashed
the
air
and
grinned
at
her.
“It’s
the
sword
that
makes
the
lord,
some
say.”

When
Podrick
Payne
returned,
he
held
Oathkeeper
as
gingerly
as
if
it
were
a
child.
Nimble
Dick
gave
a
whistle
at
the
sight
of
the
ornate
scabbard
with
its
row
of
lion’s
heads,
but
grew
quiet
when
she
drew
the
blade
and
tried
a
cut.
Even
the
sound
of
it
is
sharper
than
an
ordinary
sword.
“With
me,”
she
told
Crabb.
She
slipped
sideways
through
the
postern,
ducking
her
head
to
pass
beneath
the
doorway’s
arch.

The
bailey
opened
up
before
her,
overgrown.
To
her
left
was
the
main
gate,
and
the
collapsed
shell
of
what
might
have
been
a
stable.
Saplings
were
poking
out
of
half
the
stalls
and
growing
up
through
the
dry
brown
thatch
of
its
roof.
To
her
right
she
saw
rotted
wooden
steps
descending
into
the
darkness
of
a
dungeon
or
a
root
cellar.
Where
the
keep
had
been
was
a
pile
of
collapsed
stones,
overgrown
with
green
and
purple
moss.
The
yard
was
all
weeds
and
pine
needles.
Soldier
pines
were
everywhere,
drawn
up
in
solemn
ranks.
In
their
midst
was
a
pale
stranger;
a
slender
young
weirwood
with
a
trunk
as
white
as
a
cloistered
maid.
Dark
red
leaves
sprouted
from
its
reaching
branches.
Beyond
was
the
emptiness
of
sky
and
sea
where
the
wall
had
collapsed...

...and
the
remnants
of
a
fire.

The
whispers
nibbled
at
her
ears,
insistent.
Brienne
knelt
beside
the
fire.
She
picked
up
a
blackened
stick,
sniffed
at
it,
stirred
the
ashes.
Someone
was
trying
to
keep
warm
last
night.
Or
else
they
were
trying
to
send
a
signal
to
a
passing
ship.

“Halloooooo,”
called
Nimble
Dick.
“Anyone
here?”

“Be
quiet,”
Brienne
told
him.

“Someone
might
be
hiding.
Wanting
to
get
a
look
at
us
before
they
show
themself.”
He
walked
to
where
the
steps
went
down
beneath
the
ground,
and
peered
down
into
the
darkness.
“Hallooooo,”
he
called
again.
“Anyone
down
there?”

Brienne
saw
a
sapling
sway.
From
the
bushes
slid
a
man,
so
caked
with
dirt
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
sprouted
from
the
earth.
A
broken
sword
was
in
his
hand,
but
it
was
his
face
that
gave
her
pause,
the
small
eyes
and
wide
flat
nostrils.

She
knew
that
nose.
She
knew
those
eyes.
Pyg,
his
friends
had
called
him.

Everything
seemed
to
happen
in
a
heartbeat.
A
second
man
slipped
over
the
lip
of
the
well,
making
no
more
noise
than
a
snake
might
make
slithering
across
a
pile
of
wet
leaves.
He
wore
an
iron
halfhelm
wrapped
in
stained
red
silk,
and
had
a
short,
thick
throwing
spear
in
hand.
Brienne
knew
him
too.
From
behind
her
came
a
rustling
as
a
head
poked
down
through
the
red
leaves.
Crabb
was
standing
underneath
the
weirwood.
He
looked
up
and
saw
the
face.
“Here,”
he
called
to
Brienne.
“It’s
your
fool.”

“Dick,”
she
called
urgently,
“to
me.”

Shagwell
dropped
from
the
weirwood,
braying
laughter.
He
was
garbed
in
motley,
but
so
faded
and
stained
that
it
showed
more
brown
than
grey
or
pink.
In
place
of
a
jester’s
flail
he
had
a
triple
morningstar,
three
spiked
balls
chained
to
a
wooden
haft.
He
swung
it
hard
and
low,
and
one
of
Crabb’s
knees
exploded
in
a
spray
of
blood
and
bone.
“That’s
funny,”
Shagwell
crowed
as
Dick
fell.
The
sword
she’d
given
him
went
flying
from
his
hand
and
vanished
in
the
weeds.
He
writhed
on
the
ground,
screaming
and
clutching
at
the
ruins
of
his
knee.
“Oh,
look,”
said
Shagwell,
“it’s
Smuggler
Dick,
the
one
who
made
the
map
for
us.
Did
you
come
all
this
way
to
give
us
back
our
gold?”

“Please,”
Dick
whimpered,
“please
don’t,
my
leg...”

“Does
it
hurt?
I
can
make
it
stop.”

“Leave
him
be,”
said
Brienne.

“DON’T!”
shrieked
Dick,
lifting
bloody
hands
to
shield
his
head.
Shagwell
whirled
the
spiked
ball
once
around
his
head
and
brought
it
down
in
the
middle
of
Crabb’s
face.
There
was
a
sickening
crunch.
In
the
silence
that
followed,
Brienne
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
own
heart.

“Bad
Shags,”
said
the
man
who’d
come
creeping
from
the
well.
When
he
saw
Brienne’s
face,
he
laughed.
“You
again,
woman?
What,
come
to
hunt
us
down?
Or
did
you
miss
our
friendly
faces?”

Shagwell
danced
from
foot
to
foot
and
spun
his
flail.
“It’s
me
she
come
for.
She
dreams
of
me
every
night,
when
she
sticks
her
fingers
up
her
slit.
She
wants
me,
lads,
the
big
horse
missed
her
merry
Shags!
I’m
going
to
fuck
her
up
the
arse
and
pump
her
full
of
motley
seed,
until
she
whelps
a
little
me.”

“You
need
to
use
a
different
hole
for
that,
Shags,”
said
Timeon,
in
his
Dornish
drawl.

“I
best
use
all
her
holes,
then.
Just
to
make
certain.”
He
moved
to
her
right
as
Pyg
was
circling
around
to
her
left,
forcing
her
back
toward
the
ragged
edge
of
the
cliff.
Passage
for
three,
Brienne
remembered.
“There
are
only
three
of
you.”

Timeon
shrugged.
“We
all
went
our
own
ways,
after
we
left
Harrenhal.
Urswyck
and
his
lot
rode
south
for
Oldtown.
Rorge
thought
he
might
slip
out
at
Saltpans.
Me
and
my
lads
made
for
Maidenpool,
but
we
couldn’t
get
near
a
ship.”
The
Dornishman
hefted
his
spear.
“You
did
for
Vargo
with
that
bite,
you
know.
His
ear
turned
black
and
started
leaking
pus.
Rorge
and
Urswyck
were
for
leaving,
but
the
Goat
says
we
got
to
hold
his
castle.
Lord
of
Harrenhal,
he
says
he
is,
no
one
was
going
to
take
it
off
him.
He
said
it
slobbery,
the
way
he
always
talked.
We
heard
the
Mountain
killed
him
piece
by
piece.
A
hand
one
day,
a
foot
the
next,
lopped
off
neat
and
clean.
They
bandaged
up
the
stumps
so
Hoat
didn’t
die.
He
was
saving
his
cock
for
last,
but
some
bird
called
him
to
King’s
Landing,
so
he
finished
it
and
rode
off.”

“I
am
not
here
for
you.
I
am
looking
for
my...”
She
almost
said
my
sister.
“...for
a
fool.”

“I’m
a
fool,”
Shagwell
announced
happily.

“The
wrong
fool,”
blurted
Brienne.
“The
one
I
want
is
with
a
highborn
girl,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Stark
of
Winterfell.”

“Then
it’s
the
Hound
you
want,”
said
Timeon.
“He’s
not
here
neither,
as
it
happens.
Just
us.”

“Sandor
Clegane?”
said
Brienne.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“He’s
the
one
that’s
got
the
Stark
girl.
The
way
I
hear
it,
she
was
making
for
Riverrun,
and
he
stole
her.
Damned
dog.”

Riverrun,
thought
Brienne.
She
was
making
for
Riverrun.
For
her
uncles.
“How
do
you
know?”

“Had
it
from
one
of
Beric’s
bunch.
The
lightning
lord
is
looking
for
her
too.
He’s
sent
his
men
all
up
and
down
the
Trident,
sniffing
after
her.
We
chanced
on
three
of
them
after
Harrenhal,
and
winkled
the
tale
from
one
before
he
died.”

“He
might
have
lied.”

“He
might
have,
but
he
didn’t.
Later
on,
we
heard
how
the
Hound
slew
three
of
his
brother’s
men
at
an
inn
by
the
crossroads.
The
girl
was
with
him
there.
The
innkeep
swore
to
it
before
Rorge
killed
him,
and
the
whores
said
the
same.
An
ugly
bunch,
they
were.
Not
so
ugly
as
you,
mind
you,
but
still...”

He
is
trying
to
distract
me,
Brienne
realized,
to
lull
me
with
his
voice.
Pyg
was
edging
closer.
Shagwell
took
a
hop
toward
her.
She
backed
away
from
them.
They
will
back
me
off
the
cliff
if
I
let
them.
“Stay
away,”
she
warned
them.

“I
think
I’m
going
to
fuck
you
up
the
nose,
wench,”
Shagwell
announced.
“Won’t
that
be
amusing?”

“He
has
a
very
small
cock,”
Timeon
explained.
“Drop
that
pretty
sword
and
might
be
we’ll
go
gentle
on
you,
woman.
We
need
gold
to
pay
these
smugglers,
that’s
all.”

“And
if
I
give
you
gold,
you’ll
let
us
go?”

“We
will.”
Timeon
smiled.
“Once
you’ve
fucked
the
lot
of
us.
We’ll
pay
you
like
a
proper
whore.
A
silver
for
each
fuck.
Or
else
we’ll
take
the
gold
and
rape
you
anyway,
and
do
you
like
the
Mountain
did
Lord
Vargo.
What’s
your
choice?”

“This.”
Brienne
threw
herself
toward
Pyg.

He
jerked
his
broken
blade
up
to
protect
his
face,
but
as
he
went
high
she
went
low.
Oathkeeper
bit
through
leather,
wool,
skin,
and
muscle,
into
the
sellsword’s
thigh.
Pyg
cut
back
wildly
as
his
leg
went
out
from
under
him.
His
broken
sword
scraped
against
her
chainmail
before
he
landed
on
his
back.
Brienne
stabbed
him
through
the
throat,
gave
the
blade
a
hard
turn,
and
slid
it
out,
whirling
just
as
Timeon’s
spear
came
flashing
past
her
face.
I
did
not
flinch,
she
thought,
as
blood
ran
red
down
her
cheek.
Did
you
see,
Ser
Goodwin?
She
hardly
felt
the
cut.

“Your
turn,”
she
told
Timeon,
as
the
Dornishman
pulled
out
a
second
spear,
shorter
and
thicker
than
the
first.
“Throw
it.”

“So
you
can
dance
away
and
charge
me?
I’d
end
up
dead
as
Pyg.
No.
Get
her,
Shags.”

“You
get
her,”
Shagwell
said.
“Did
you
see
what
she
did
to
Pyg?
She’s
mad
with
moon
blood.”
The
fool
was
behind
her,
Timeon
in
front.
No
matter
how
she
turned,
one
was
at
her
back.

“Get
her,”
urged
Timeon,
“and
you
can
fuck
her
corpse.”

“Oh,
you
do
love
me.”
The
morningstar
was
whirling.
Choose
one,
Brienne
told
herself.
Choose
one
and
kill
him
quickly.
Then
a
stone
came
out
of
nowhere,
and
hit
Shagwell
in
the
head.
Brienne
did
not
hesitate.
She
flew
at
Timeon.

He
was
better
than
Pyg,
but
he
had
only
a
short
throwing
spear,
and
she
had
a
Valyrian
steel
blade.
Oathkeeper
was
alive
in
her
hands.
She
had
never
been
so
quick.
The
blade
became
a
grey
blur.
He
wounded
her
in
the
shoulder
as
she
came
at
him,
but
she
slashed
off
his
ear
and
half
his
cheek,
hacked
the
head
off
his
spear,
and
put
a
foot
of
rippled
steel
into
his
belly
through
the
links
of
the
chainmail
byrnie
he
was
wearing.

Timeon
was
still
trying
to
fight
as
she
pulled
her
blade
from
him,
its
fullers
running
red
with
blood.
He
clawed
at
his
belt
and
came
up
with
a
dagger,
so
Brienne
cut
his
hand
off.
That
one
was
for
Jaime.
“Mother
have
mercy,”
the
Dornishman
gasped,
the
blood
bubbling
from
his
mouth
and
spurting
from
his
wrist.
“Finish
it.
Send
me
back
to
Dorne,
you
bloody
bitch.”

She
did.

Shagwell
was
on
his
knees
when
she
turned,
looking
dazed
as
he
fumbled
for
the
morningstar.
As
he
staggered
to
his
feet,
another
stone
slammed
him
in
the
ear.
Podrick
had
climbed
the
fallen
wall
and
was
standing
amongst
the
ivy
glowering,
a
fresh
rock
in
his
hand.
“I
told
you
I
could
fight!”
he
shouted
down.

Shagwell
tried
to
crawl
away.
“I
yield,”
the
fool
cried,
“I
yield.
You
mustn’t
hurt
sweet
Shagwell,
I’m
too
droll
to
die.”

“You
are
no
better
than
the
rest
of
them.
You
have
robbed
and
raped
and
murdered.”

“Oh,
I
have,
I
have,
I
shan’t
deny
it...
but
I’m
amusing,
with
all
my
japes
and
capers.
I
make
men
laugh.”

“And
women
weep.”

“Is
that
my
fault?
Women
have
no
sense
of
humor.”

Brienne
lowered
Oathkeeper.
“Dig
a
grave.
There,
beneath
the
weirwood.”
She
pointed
with
her
blade.

“I
have
no
spade.”

“You
have
two
hands.”
One
more
than
you
left
Jaime.

“Why
bother?
Leave
them
for
the
crows.”

“Timeon
and
Pyg
can
feed
the
crows.
Nimble
Dick
will
have
a
grave.
He
was
a
Crabb.
This
is
his
place.”

The
ground
was
soft
from
rain,
but
even
so
it
took
the
fool
the
rest
of
the
day
to
dig
down
deep
enough.
Night
was
falling
by
the
time
he
was
done,
and
his
hands
were
bloody
and
blistered.
Brienne
sheathed
Oathkeeper,
gathered
up
Dick
Crabb,
and
carried
him
to
the
hole.
His
face
was
hard
to
look
on.
“I’m
sorry
that
I
never
trusted
you.
I
don’t
know
how
to
do
that
anymore.”

As
she
knelt
to
lay
the
body
down,
she
thought,
The
fool
will
make
his
try
now,
whilst
my
back
is
turned.

She
heard
his
ragged
breathing
half
a
heartbeat
before
Podrick
cried
out
his
warning.
Shagwell
had
a
jagged
chunk
of
rock
clutched
in
one
hand.
Brienne
had
her
dagger
up
her
sleeve.

A
dagger
will
beat
a
rock
almost
every
time.

She
knocked
aside
his
arm
and
punched
the
steel
into
his
bowels.
“Laugh,”
she
snarled
at
him.
He
moaned
instead.
“Laugh,”
she
repeated,
grabbing
his
throat
with
one
hand
and
stabbing
at
his
belly
with
the
other.
“Laugh!”
She
kept
saying
it,
over
and
over,
until
her
hand
was
red
up
to
the
wrist
and
the
stink
of
the
fool’s
dying
was
like
to
choke
her.
But
Shagwell
never
laughed.
The
sobs
that
Brienne
heard
were
all
her
own.
When
she
realized
that,
she
threw
down
her
knife
and
shuddered.

Podrick
helped
her
lower
Nimble
Dick
into
his
hole.
By
the
time
they
were
done
the
moon
was
rising.
Brienne
rubbed
the
dirt
from
her
hands
and
tossed
two
dragons
down
into
the
grave.

“Why
did
you
do
that,
my
lady?
Ser?”
asked
Pod.

“It
was
the
reward
I
promised
him
for
finding
me
the
fool.”

Laughter
sounded
from
behind
them.
She
ripped
Oathkeeper
from
her
sheath
and
whirled,
expecting
more
Bloody
Mummers...
but
it
was
only
Hyle
Hunt
atop
the
crumbling
wall,
his
legs
crossed.
“If
there
are
brothels
down
in
hell,
the
wretch
will
thank
you,”
the
knight
called
down.
“Elsewise,
that’s
a
waste
of
good
gold.”

“I
keep
my
promises.
What
are
you
doing
here?”

“Lord
Randyll
bid
me
follow
you.
If
by
some
freak’s
chance
you
stumbled
onto
Sansa
Stark,
he
told
me
to
bring
her
back
to
Maidenpool.
Have
no
fear,
I
was
commanded
not
to
harm
you.”

Brienne
snorted.
“As
if
you
could.”

“What
will
you
do
now,
my
lady?”

“Cover
him.”

“About
the
girl,
I
meant.
The
Lady
Sansa.”

Brienne
thought
a
moment.
“She
was
making
for
Riverrun,
if
Timeon
told
it
true.
Somewhere
along
the
way
she
was
taken
by
the
Hound.
If
I
find
him...”

“...he’ll
kill
you.”

“Or
I’ll
kill
him,”
she
said
stubbornly.
“Will
you
help
me
cover
up
poor
Crabb,
ser?”

“No
true
knight
could
refuse
such
beauty.”
Ser
Hyle
climbed
down
from
the
wall.
Together,
they
shoved
the
dirt
on
top
of
Nimble
Dick
as
the
moon
rose
higher
in
the
sky,
and
down
below
the
ground
the
heads
of
forgotten
kings
whispered
secrets.





THE
QUEENMAKER

Beneath
the
burning
sun
of
Dorne,
wealth
was
measured
as
much
in
water
as
in
gold,
so
every
well
was
zealously
guarded.
The
well
at
Shandystone
had
gone
dry
a
hundred
years
before,
however,
and
its
guardians
had
departed
for
some
wetter
place,
abandoning
their
modest
holdfast
with
its
fluted
columns
and
triple
arches.
Afterward
the
sands
had
crept
back
in
to
reclaim
their
own.

Arianne
Martell
arrived
with
Drey
and
Sylva
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down,
with
the
west
a
tapestry
of
gold
and
purple
and
the
clouds
all
glowing
crimson.
The
ruins
seemed
aglow
as
well;
the
fallen
columns
glimmered
pinkly,
red
shadows
crept
across
the
cracked
stone
floors,
and
the
sands
themselves
turned
from
gold
to
orange
to
purple
as
the
light
faded.
Garin
had
arrived
a
few
hours
earlier,
and
the
knight
called
Darkstar
the
day
before.

“It
is
lovely
here,”
Drey
observed
as
he
was
helping
Garin
water
the
horses.
They
had
carried
their
own
water
with
them.
The
sand
steeds
of
Dorne
were
swift
and
tireless,
and
would
keep
going
for
long
leagues
after
other
horses
had
given
out,
but
even
such
as
they
could
not
run
dry.
“How
did
you
know
of
this
place?”

“My
uncle
brought
me
here,
with
Tyene
and
Sarella.”
The
memory
made
Arianne
smile.
“He
caught
some
vipers
and
showed
Tyene
the
safest
way
to
milk
them
for
their
venom.
Sarella
turned
over
rocks,
brushed
sand
off
the
mosaics,
and
wanted
to
know
everything
there
was
to
know
about
the
people
who
had
lived
here.”

“And
what
did
you
do,
princess?”
asked
Spotted
Sylva.

I
sat
beside
the
well
and
pretended
that
some
robber
knight
had
brought
me
here
to
have
his
way
with
me,
she
thought,
a
tall
hard
man
with
black
eyes
and
a
widow’s
peak.
The
memory
made
her
uneasy.
“I
dreamed,”
she
said,
“and
when
the
sun
went
down
I
sat
cross-legged
at
my
uncle’s
feet
and
begged
him
for
a
story.”

“Prince
Oberyn
was
full
of
stories.”
Garin
had
been
with
them
as
well
that
day;
he
was
Arianne’s
milk
brother,
and
they
had
been
inseparable
since
before
they
learned
to
walk.
“He
told
about
Prince
Garin,
I
remember,
the
one
that
I
was
named
for.”

“Garin
the
Great,”
offered
Drey,
“the
wonder
of
the
Rhoyne.”

“That’s
the
one.
He
made
Valyria
tremble.”

“They
trembled,”
said
Ser
Gerold,
“then
they
killed
him.
If
I
led
a
quarter
of
a
million
men
to
death,
would
they
call
me
Gerold
the
Great?”
He
snorted.
“I
shall
remain
Darkstar,
I
think.
At
least
it
is
mine
own.”
He
unsheathed
his
longsword,
sat
upon
the
lip
of
the
dry
well,
and
began
to
hone
the
blade
with
an
oilstone.

Arianne
watched
him
warily.
He
is
highborn
enough
to
make
a
worthy
consort,
she
thought.
Father
would
question
my
good
sense,
but
our
children
would
be
as
beautiful
as
dragonlords.
If
there
was
a
handsomer
man
in
Dorne,
she
did
not
know
him.
Ser
Gerold
Dayne
had
an
aquiline
nose,
high
cheekbones,
a
strong
jaw.
He
kept
his
face
clean-shaven,
but
his
thick
hair
fell
to
his
collar
like
a
silver
glacier,
divided
by
a
streak
of
midnight
black.
He
has
a
cruel
mouth,
though,
and
a
crueler
tongue.
His
eyes
seemed
black
as
he
sat
outlined
against
the
dying
sun,
sharpening
his
steel,
but
she
had
looked
at
them
from
a
closer
vantage
and
she
knew
that
they
were
purple.
Dark
purple.
Dark
and
angry.

He
must
have
felt
her
gaze
upon
him,
for
he
looked
up
from
his
sword,
met
her
eyes,
and
smiled.
Arianne
felt
heat
rushing
to
her
face.
I
should
never
have
brought
him.
If
he
gives
me
such
a
look
when
Arys
is
here,
we
will
have
blood
on
the
sand.
Whose,
she
could
not
say.
By
tradition
the
Kingsguard
were
the
finest
knights
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms...
but
Darkstar
was
Darkstar.

The
Dornish
nights
grow
cold
out
upon
the
sands.
Garin
gathered
wood
for
them,
bleached
white
branches
from
trees
that
had
withered
up
and
died
a
hundred
years
ago.
Drey
built
a
fire,
whistling
as
he
struck
sparks
off
his
flint.

Once
the
kindling
caught,
they
sat
around
the
flames
and
passed
a
skin
of
summerwine
from
hand
to
hand...
all
but
Darkstar,
who
preferred
to
drink
unsweetened
lemonwater.
Garin
was
in
a
lively
mood
and
entertained
them
with
the
latest
tales
from
the
Planky
Town
at
the
mouth
of
the
Greenblood,
where
the
orphans
of
the
river
came
to
trade
with
the
carracks,
cogs,
and
galleys
from
across
the
narrow
sea.
If
the
sailors
could
be
believed,
the
east
was
seething
with
wonders
and
terrors:
a
slave
revolt
in
Astapor,
dragons
in
Qarth,
grey
plague
in
Yi
Ti.
A
new
corsair
king
had
risen
in
the
Basilisk
Isles
and
raided
Tall
Trees
Town,
and
in
Qohor
followers
of
the
red
priests
had
rioted
and
tried
to
burn
down
the
Black
Goat.
“And
the
Golden
Company
broke
its
contract
with
Myr,
just
as
the
Myrmen
were
about
to
go
to
war
with
Lys.”

“The
Lyseni
bought
them
off,”
suggested
Sylva.

“Clever
Lyseni,”
Drey
said.
“Clever,
craven
Lyseni.”

Arianne
knew
better.
If
Quentyn
has
the
Golden
Company
behind
him...
“Beneath
the
gold
the
bitter
steel,”
was
their
cry.
You
will
need
bitter
steel
and
more,
brother,
if
you
think
to
set
me
aside.
Arianne
was
loved
in
Dorne,
Quentyn
little
known.
No
company
of
sellswords
could
change
that.

Ser
Gerold
rose.
“I
believe
I’ll
have
a
piss.”

“Watch
where
you
set
your
feet,”
Drey
cautioned.
“It
has
been
a
while
since
Prince
Oberyn
milked
the
local
vipers.”

“I
was
weaned
on
venom,
Dalt.
Any
viper
takes
a
bite
of
me
will
rue
it.”
Ser
Gerold
vanished
through
a
broken
arch.

When
he
was
gone,
the
others
exchanged
glances.
“Forgive
me,
princess,”
said
Garin
softly,
“but
I
do
not
like
that
man.”

“A
pity,”
Drey
said.
“I
believe
he’s
half
in
love
with
you.”

“We
need
him,”
Arianne
reminded
them.
“It
may
be
that
we
will
need
his
sword,
and
we
will
surely
need
his
castle.”

“High
Hermitage
is
not
the
only
castle
in
Dorne,”
Spotted
Sylva
pointed
out,
“and
you
have
other
knights
who
love
you
well.
Drey
is
a
knight.”

“I
am,”
he
affirmed.
“I
have
a
wonderful
horse
and
a
very
fine
sword,
and
my
valor
is
second
to...
well,
several,
actually.”

“More
like
several
hundred,
ser,”
said
Garin.

Arianne
left
them
to
their
banter.
Drey
and
Spotted
Sylva
were
her
dearest
friends,
aside
from
her
cousin
Tyene,
and
Garin
had
been
teasing
her
since
both
of
them
were
drinking
from
his
mother’s
teats,
but
just
now
she
was
in
no
mood
for
japery.
The
sun
was
gone,
and
the
sky
was
full
of
stars.
So
many.
She
leaned
her
back
against
a
fluted
pillar
and
wondered
if
her
brother
was
looking
at
the
same
stars
tonight,
wherever
he
might
be.
Do
you
see
the
white
one,
Quentyn?
That
is
Nymeria’s
star,
burning
bright,
and
that
milky
band
behind
her,
those
are
ten
thousand
ships.
She
burned
as
bright
as
any
man,
and
so
shall
I.
You
will
not
rob
me
of
my
birthright!

Quentyn
had
been
very
young
when
he
was
sent
to
Yronwood;
too
young,
according
to
their
mother.
Norvoshi
did
not
foster
out
their
children,
and
Lady
Mellario
had
never
forgiven
Prince
Doran
for
taking
her
son
away
from
her.
“I
like
it
no
more
than
you
do,”
Arianne
had
overheard
her
father
say,
“but
there
is
a
blood
debt,
and
Quentyn
is
the
only
coin
Lord
Ormond
will
accept.”

“Coin?”
her
mother
had
screamed.
“He
is
your
son.
What
sort
of
father
uses
his
own
flesh
and
blood
to
pay
his
debts?”

“The
princely
sort,”
Doran
Martell
had
answered.

Prince
Doran
was
still
pretending
that
her
brother
was
with
Lord
Yronwood,
but
Garin’s
mother
had
seen
him
at
the
Planky
Town,
posing
as
a
merchant.
One
of
his
companions
had
a
lazy
eye,
the
same
as
Cletus
Yronwood,
Lord
Anders’s
randy
son.
A
maester
traveled
with
them
too,
a
maester
skilled
in
tongues.
My
brother
is
not
as
clever
as
he
thinks.
A
clever
man
would
have
left
from
Oldtown,
even
if
it
meant
a
longer
voyage.
In
Oldtown
he
might
have
gone
unrecognized.
Arianne
had
friends
amongst
the
orphans
of
the
Planky
Town,
and
some
had
grown
curious
as
to
why
a
prince
and
a
lord’s
son
might
be
traveling
under
false
names
and
seeking
passage
across
the
narrow
sea.
One
of
them
had
crept
through
a
window
of
a
night,
tickled
the
lock
on
Quentyn’s
little
strongbox,
and
found
the
scrolls
within.

Arianne
would
have
given
much
and
more
to
know
that
this
secret
trip
across
the
narrow
sea
was
Quentyn’s
own
doing,
and
his
alone...
but
parchments
he
had
carried
had
been
sealed
with
the
sun
and
spear
of
Dorne.
Garin’s
cousin
had
not
dared
break
the
seal
to
read
them,
but...

“Princess.”
Ser
Gerold
Dayne
stood
behind
her,
half
in
starlight
and
half
in
shadow.

“How
was
your
piss?”
Arianne
inquired
archly.

“The
sands
were
duly
grateful.”
Dayne
put
a
foot
upon
the
head
of
a
statue
that
might
have
been
the
Maiden
till
the
sands
had
scoured
her
face
away.
“It
occurred
to
me
as
I
was
pissing
that
this
plan
of
yours
may
not
yield
you
what
you
want.”

“And
what
is
it
I
want,
ser?”

“The
Sand
Snakes
freed.
Vengeance
for
Oberyn
and
Elia.
Do
I
know
the
song?
You
want
a
little
taste
of
lion
blood.”

That,
and
my
birthright.
I
want
Sunspear,
and
my
father’s
seat.
I
want
Dorne.
“I
want
justice.”

“Call
it
what
you
will.
Crowning
the
Lannister
girl
is
a
hollow
gesture.
She
will
never
sit
the
Iron
Throne.
Nor
will
you
get
the
war
you
want.
The
lion
is
not
so
easily
provoked.”

“The
lion’s
dead.
Who
knows
which
cub
the
lioness
prefers?”

“The
one
in
her
own
den.”
Ser
Gerold
drew
his
sword.
It
glimmered
in
the
starlight,
sharp
as
lies.
“This
is
how
you
start
a
war.
Not
with
a
crown
of
gold,
but
with
a
blade
of
steel.”

I
am
no
murderer
of
children.
“Put
that
away.
Myrcella
is
under
my
protection.
And
Ser
Arys
will
permit
no
harm
to
come
to
his
precious
princess,
you
know
that.”

“No,
my
lady.
What
I
know
is
that
Daynes
have
been
killing
Oakhearts
for
several
thousand
years.”

His
arrogance
took
her
breath
away.
“It
seems
to
me
that
Oakhearts
have
been
killing
Daynes
for
just
as
long.”

“We
all
have
our
family
traditions.”
Darkstar
sheathed
his
sword.
“The
moon
is
rising,
and
I
see
your
paragon
approaching.”

His
eyes
were
sharp.
The
horseman
on
the
tall
grey
palfrey
did
indeed
prove
to
be
Ser
Arys,
white
cloak
fluttering
bravely
as
he
spurred
across
the
sand.
Princess
Myrcella
rode
pillion
behind
him,
swaddled
in
a
cowled
robe
that
hid
her
golden
curls.

As
Ser
Arys
helped
her
from
the
saddle,
Drey
=======
CATELYN

“My
lady,
you
ought
cover
your
head,”
Ser
Rodrik
told
her
as
their
horses
plodded
north.
“You
will
take
a
chill.”

“It
is
only
water,
Ser
Rodrik,”
Catelyn
replied.
Her
hair
hung
wet
and
heavy,
a
loose
strand
stuck
to
her
forehead,
and
she
could
imagine
how
ragged
and
wild
she
must
look,
but
for
once
she
did
not
care.
The
southern
rain
was
soft
and
warm.
Catelyn
liked
the
feel
of
it
on
her
face,
gentle
as
a
mother’s
kisses.
It
took
her
back
to
her
childhood,
to
long
grey
days
at
Riverrun.
She
remembered
the
godswood,
drooping
branches
heavy
with
moisture,
and
the
sound
of
her
brother’s
laughter
as
he
chased
her
through
piles
of
damp
leaves.
She
remembered
making
mud
pies
with
Lysa,
the
weight
of
them,
the
mud
slick
and
brown
between
her
fingers.
They
had
served
them
to
Littlefinger,
giggling,
and
he’d
eaten
so
much
mud
he
was
sick
for
a
week.
How
young
they
all
had
been.

Catelyn
had
almost
forgotten.
In
the
north,
the
rain
fell
cold
and
hard,
and
sometimes
at
night
it
turned
to
ice.
It
was
as
likely
to
kill
a
crop
as
nurture
it,
and
it
sent
grown
men
running
for
the
nearest
shelter.
That
was
no
rain
for
little
girls
to
play
in.

“I
am
soaked
through,”
Ser
Rodrik
complained.
“Even
my
bones
are
wet.”
The
woods
pressed
close
around
them,
and
the
steady
pattering
of
rain
on
leaves
was
accompanied
by
the
small
sucking
sounds
their
horses
made
as
their
hooves
pulled
free
of
the
mud.
“We
will
want
a
fire
tonight,
my
lady,
and
a
hot
meal
would
serve
us
both.”

“There
is
an
inn
at
the
crossroads
up
ahead,”
Catelyn
told
him.
She
had
slept
many
a
night
there
in
her
youth,
traveling
with
her
father.
Lord
Hoster
Tully
had
been
a
restless
man
in
his
prime,
always
riding
somewhere.
She
still
remembered
the
innkeep,
a
fat
woman
named
Masha
Heddle
who
chewed
sourleaf
night
and
day
and
seemed
to
have
an
endless
supply
of
smiles
and
sweet
cakes
for
the
children.
The
sweet
cakes
had
been
soaked
with
honey,
rich
and
heavy
on
the
tongue,
but
how
Catelyn
had
dreaded
those
smiles.
The
sourleaf
had
stained
Masha’s
teeth
a
dark
red,
and
made
her
smile
a
bloody
horror.

“An
inn,”
Ser
Rodrik
repeated
wistfully.
“If
only…
but
we
dare
not
risk
it.
If
we
wish
to
remain
unknown,
I
think
it
best
we
seek
out
some
small
holdfast…”
He
broke
off
as
they
heard
sounds
up
the
road;
splashing
water,
the
clink
of
mail,
a
horse’s
whinny.
“Riders,”
he
warned,
his
hand
dropping
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword.
Even
on
the
kingsroad,
it
never
hurt
to
be
wary.

They
followed
the
sounds
around
a
lazy
bend
of
the
road
and
saw
them;
a
column
of
armed
men
noisily
fording
a
swollen
stream.
Catelyn
reined
up
to
let
them
pass.
The
banner
in
the
hand
of
the
foremost
rider
hung
sodden
and
limp,
but
the
guardsmen
wore
indigo
cloaks
and
on
their
shoulders
flew
the
silver
eagle
of
Seagard.
“Mallisters,”
Ser
Rodrik
whispered
to
her,
as
if
she
had
not
known.
“My
lady,
best
pull
up
your
hood.”

Catelyn
made
no
move.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
himself
rode
with
them,
surrounded
by
his
knights,
his
son
Patrek
by
his
side
and
their
squires
close
behind.
They
were
riding
for
King’s
Landing
and
the
Hand’s
tourney,
she
knew.
For
the
past
week,
the
travelers
had
been
thick
as
flies
upon
the
kingsroad;
knights
and
freeriders,
singers
with
their
harps
and
drums,
heavy
wagons
laden
with
hops
or
corn
or
casks
of
honey,
traders
and
craftsmen
and
whores,
and
all
of
them
moving
south.

She
studied
Lord
Jason
boldly.
The
last
time
she
had
seen
him
he
had
been
jesting
with
her
uncle
at
her
wedding
feast;
the
Mallisters
stood
bannermen
to
the
Tullys,
and
his
gifts
had
been
lavish.
His
brown
hair
was
salted
with
white
now,
his
face
chiseled
gaunt
by
time,
yet
the
years
had
not
touched
his
pride.
He
rode
like
a
man
who
feared
nothing.
Catelyn
envied
him
that;
she
had
come
to
fear
so
much.
As
the
riders
passed,
Lord
Jason
nodded
a
curt
greeting,
but
it
was
only
a
high
lord’s
courtesy
to
strangers
chance
met
on
the
road.
There
was
no
recognition
in
those
fierce
eyes,
and
his
son
did
not
even
waste
a
look.

“He
did
not
know
you,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
after,
wondering.

“He
saw
a
pair
of
mud-spattered
travelers
by
the
side
of
the
road,
wet
and
tired.
It
would
never
occur
to
him
to
suspect
that
one
of
them
was
the
daughter
of
his
liege
lord.
I
think
we
shall
be
safe
enough
at
the
inn,
Ser
Rodrik.”

It
was
near
dark
when
they
reached
it,
at
the
crossroads
north
of
the
great
confluence
of
the
Trident.
Masha
Heddle
was
fatter
and
greyer
than
Catelyn
remembered,
still
chewing
her
sourleaf,
but
she
gave
them
only
the
most
cursory
of
looks,
with
nary
a
hint
of
her
ghastly
red
smile.
“Two
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
stair,
that’s
all
there
is,”
she
said,
chewing
all
the
while.
“They’re
under
the
bell
tower,
you
won’t
be
missing
meals,
though
there’s
some
thinks
it
too
noisy.
Can’t
be
helped.
We’re
full
up,
or
near
as
makes
no
matter.
It’s
those
rooms
or
the
road.”

It
was
those
rooms,
low,
dusty
garrets
at
the
top
of
a
cramped
narrow
staircase.
“Leave
your
boots
down
here,”
Masha
told
them
after
she’d
taken
their
coin.
“The
boy
will
clean
them.
I
won’t
have
you
tracking
mud
up
my
stairs.
Mind
the
bell.
Those
who
come
late
to
meals
don’t
eat.”
There
were
no
smiles,
and
no
mention
of
sweet
cakes.

When
the
supper
bell
rang,
the
sound
was
deafening.
Catelyn
had
changed
into
dry
clothes.
She
sat
by
the
window,
watching
rain
run
down
the
pane.
The
glass
was
milky
and
full
of
bubbles,
and
a
wet
dusk
was
falling
outside.
Catelyn
could
just
make
out
the
muddy
crossing
where
the
two
great
roads
met.

The
crossroads
gave
her
pause.
If
they
turned
west
from
here,
it
was
an
easy
ride
down
to
Riverrun.
Her
father
had
always
given
her
wise
counsel
when
she
needed
it
most,
and
she
yearned
to
talk
to
him,
to
warn
him
of
the
gathering
storm.
If
Winterfell
needed
to
brace
for
war,
how
much
more
so
Riverrun,
so
much
closer
to
King’s
Landing,
with
the
power
of
Casterly
Rock
looming
to
the
west
like
a
shadow.
If
only
her
father
had
been
stronger,
she
might
have
chanced
it,
but
Hoster
Tully
had
been
bedridden
these
past
two
years,
and
Catelyn
was
loath
to
tax
him
now.

The
eastern
road
was
wilder
and
more
dangerous,
climbing
through
rocky
foothills
and
thick
forests
into
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon,
past
high
passes
and
deep
chasms
to
the
Vale
of
Arryn
and
the
stony
Fingers
beyond.
Above
the
Vale,
the
Eyrie
stood
high
and
impregnable,
its
towers
reaching
for
the
sky.
There
she
would
find
her
sister…
and,
perhaps,
some
of
the
answers
Ned
sought.
Surely
Lysa
knew
more
than
she
had
dared
to
put
in
her
letter.
She
might
have
the
very
proof
that
Ned
needed
to
bring
the
Lannisters
to
ruin,
and
if
it
came
to
war,
they
would
need
the
Arryns
and
the
eastern
lords
who
owed
them
service.

Yet
the
mountain
road
was
perilous.
Shadowcats
prowled
those
passes,
rock
slides
were
common,
and
the
mountain
clans
were
lawless
brigands,
descending
from
the
heights
to
rob
and
kill
and
melting
away
like
snow
whenever
the
knights
rode
out
from
the
Vale
in
search
of
them.
Even
Jon
Arryn,
as
great
a
lord
as
any
the
Eyrie
had
ever
known,
had
always
traveled
in
strength
when
he
crossed
the
mountains.
Catelyn’s
only
strength
was
one
elderly
knight,
armored
in
loyalty.

No,
she
thought,
Riverrun
and
the
Eyrie
would
have
to
wait.
Her
path
ran
north
to
Winterfell,
where
her
sons
and
her
duty
were
waiting
for
her.
As
soon
as
they
were
safely
past
the
Neck,
she
could
declare
herself
to
one
of
Ned’s
bannermen,
and
send
riders
racing
ahead
with
orders
to
mount
a
watch
on
the
kingsroad.

The
rain
obscured
the
fields
beyond
the
crossroads,
but
Catelyn
saw
the
land
clear
enough
in
her
memory.
The
marketplace
was
just
across
the
way,
and
the
village
a
mile
farther
on,
half
a
hundred
white
cottages
surrounding
a
small
stone
sept.
There
would
be
more
now;
the
summer
had
been
long
and
peaceful.
North
of
here
the
kingsroad
ran
along
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident,
through
fertile
valleys
and
green
woodlands,
past
thriving
towns
and
stout
holdfasts
and
the
castles
of
the
river
lords.

Catelyn
knew
them
all:
the
Blackwoods
and
the
Brackens,
ever
enemies,
whose
quarrels
her
father
was
obliged
to
settle;
Lady
Whent,
last
of
her
line,
who
dwelt
with
her
ghosts
in
the
cavernous
vaults
of
Harrenhal;
irascible
Lord
Frey,
who
had
outlived
seven
wives
and
filled
his
twin
castles
with
children,
grandchildren,
and
great-grandchildren,
and
bastards
and
grandbastards
as
well.
All
of
them
were
bannermen
to
the
Tullys,
their
swords
sworn
to
the
service
of
Riverrun.
Catelyn
wondered
if
that
would
be
enough,
if
it
came
to
war.
Her
father
was
the
staunchest
man
who’d
ever
lived,
and
she
had
no
doubt
that
he
would
call
his
banners…
but
would
the
banners
come?
The
Darrys
and
Rygers
and
Mootons
had
sworn
oaths
to
Riverrun
as
well,
yet
they
had
fought
with
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident,
while
Lord
Frey
had
arrived
with
his
levies
well
after
the
battle
was
over,
leaving
some
doubt
as
to
which
army
he
had
planned
to
join
(theirs,
he
had
assured
the
victors
solemnly
in
the
aftermath,
but
ever
after
her
father
had
called
him
the
Late
Lord
Frey).
It
must
not
come
to
war,
Catelyn
thought
fervently.
They
must
not
let
it.

Ser
Rodrik
came
for
her
just
as
the
bell
ceased
its
clangor.
“We
had
best
make
haste
if
we
hope
to
eat
tonight,
my
lady.”

“It
might
be
safer
if
we
were
not
knight
and
lady
until
we
pass
the
Neck,”
she
told
him.
“Common
travelers
attract
less
notice.
A
father
and
daughter
taken
to
the
road
on
some
family
business,
say.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
agreed.
It
was
only
when
she
laughed
that
he
realized
what
he’d
done.
“The
old
courtesies
die
hard,
my—my
daughter.”
He
tried
to
tug
on
his
missing
whiskers,
and
sighed
with
exasperation.

Catelyn
took
his
arm.
“Come,
Father,”
she
said.
“You’ll
find
that
Masha
Heddle
sets
a
good
table,
I
think,
but
try
not
to
praise
her.
You
truly
don’t
want
to
see
her
smile.”

The
common
room
was
long
and
drafty,
with
a
row
of
huge
wooden
kegs
at
one
end
and
a
fireplace
at
the
other.
A
serving
boy
ran
back
and
forth
with
skewers
of
meat
while
Masha
drew
beer
from
the
kegs,
chewing
her
sourleaf
all
the
while.

The
benches
were
crowded,
townsfolk
and
farmers
mingling
freely
with
all
manner
of
travelers.
The
crossroads
made
for
odd
companions;
dyers
with
black
and
purple
hands
shared
a
bench
with
rivermen
reeking
of
fish,
an
ironsmith
thick
with
muscle
squeezed
in
beside
a
wizened
old
septon,
hard-bitten
sellswords
and
soft
plump
merchants
swapped
news
like
boon
companions.

The
company
included
more
swords
than
Catelyn
would
have
liked.
Three
by
the
fire
wore
the
red
stallion
badge
of
the
Brackens,
and
there
was
a
large
party
in
blue
steel
ringmail
and
capes
of
a
silvery
grey.
On
their
shoulder
was
another
familiar
sigil,
the
twin
towers
of
House
Frey.
She
studied
their
faces,
but
they
were
all
too
young
to
have
known
her.
The
senior
among
them
would
have
been
no
older
than
Bran
when
she
went
north.

Ser
Rodrik
found
them
an
empty
place
on
the
bench
near
the
kitchen.
Across
the
table
a
handsome
youth
was
fingering
a
woodharp.
“Seven
blessings
to
you,
goodfolk,”
he
said
as
they
sat.
An
empty
wine
cup
stood
on
the
table
before
him.

“And
to
you,
singer,”
Catelyn
returned.
Ser
Rodrik
called
for
bread
and
meat
and
beer
in
a
tone
that
meant
now.
The
singer,
a
youth
of
some
eighteen
years,
eyed
them
boldly
and
asked
where
they
were
going,
and
from
whence
they
had
come,
and
what
news
they
had,
letting
the
questions
fly
as
quick
as
arrows
and
never
pausing
for
an
answer.
“We
left
King’s
Landing
a
fortnight
ago,”
Catelyn
replied,
answering
the
safest
of
his
questions.

“That’s
where
I’m
bound,”
the
youth
said.
As
she
had
suspected,
he
was
more
interested
in
telling
his
own
story
than
in
hearing
theirs.
Singers
loved
nothing
half
so
well
as
the
sound
of
their
own
voices.
“The
Hand’s
tourney
means
rich
lords
with
fat
purses.
The
last
time
I
came
away
with
more
silver
than
I
could
carry…
or
would
have,
if
I
hadn’t
lost
it
all
betting
on
the
Kingslayer
to
win
the
day.”

“The
gods
frown
on
the
gambler,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
sternly.
He
was
of
the
north,
and
shared
the
Stark
views
on
tournaments.

“They
frowned
on
me,
for
certain,”
the
singer
said.
“Your
cruel
gods
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers
altogether
did
me
in.”

“No
doubt
that
was
a
lesson
for
you,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

“It
was.
This
time
my
coin
will
champion
Ser
Loras.”

Ser
Rodrik
tried
to
tug
at
whiskers
that
were
not
there,
but
before
he
could
frame
a
rebuke
the
serving
boy
came
scurrying
up.
He
laid
trenchers
of
bread
before
them
and
filled
them
with
chunks
of
browned
meat
off
a
skewer,
dripping
with
hot
juice.
Another
skewer
held
tiny
onions,
fire
peppers,
and
fat
mushrooms.
Ser
Rodrik
set
to
lustily
as
the
lad
ran
back
to
fetch
them
beer.

“My
name
is
Marillion,”
the
singer
said,
plucking
a
string
on
his
woodharp.
“Doubtless
you’ve
heard
me
play
somewhere?”

His
manner
made
Catelyn
smile.
Few
wandering
singers
ever
ventured
as
far
north
as
Winterfell,
but
she
knew
his
like
from
her
girlhood
in
Riverrun.
“I
fear
not,”
she
told
him.

He
drew
a
plaintive
chord
from
the
woodharp.
“That
is
your
loss,”
he
said.
“Who
was
the
finest
singer
you’ve
ever
heard?”

“Alia
of
Braavos,”
Ser
Rodrik
answered
at
once.

“Oh,
I’m
much
better
than
that
old
stick,”
Marillion
said.
“If
you
have
the
silver
for
a
song,
I’ll
gladly
show
you.”

“I
might
have
a
copper
or
two,
but
I’d
sooner
toss
it
down
a
well
than
pay
for
your
howling,”
Ser
Rodrik
groused.
His
opinion
of
singers
was
well
known;
music
was
a
lovely
thing
for
girls,
but
he
could
not
comprehend
why
any
healthy
boy
would
fill
his
hand
with
a
harp
when
he
might
have
had
a
sword.

“Your
grandfather
has
a
sour
nature,”
Marillion
said
to
Catelyn.
“I
meant
to
do
you
honor.
An
homage
to
your
beauty.
In
truth,
I
was
made
to
sing
for
kings
and
high
lords.”

“Oh,
I
can
see
that,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lord
Tully
is
fond
of
song,
I
hear.
No
doubt
you’ve
been
to
Riverrun.”

“A
hundred
times,”
the
singer
said
airily.
“They
keep
a
chamber
for
me,
and
the
young
lord
is
like
a
brother.”

Catelyn
smiled,
wondering
what
Edmure
would
think
of
that.
Another
singer
had
once
bedded
a
girl
her
brother
fancied;
he
had
hated
the
breed
ever
since.
“And
Winterfell?”
she
asked
him.
“Have
you
traveled
north?”

“Why
would
I?’
Marillion
asked.
“It’s
all
blizzards
and
bearskins
up
there,
and
the
Starks
know
no
music
but
the
howling
of
wolves.”
Distantly,
she
was
aware
of
the
door
banging
open
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.

“Innkeep,”
a
servant’s
voice
called
out
behind
her,
“we
have
horses
that
want
stabling,
and
my
lord
of
Lannister
requires
a
room
and
a
hot
bath.”

“Oh,
gods,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
before
Catelyn
reached
out
to
silence
him,
her
fingers
tightening
hard
around
his
forearm.

Masha
Heddle
was
bowing
and
smiling
her
hideous
red
smile.
“I’m
sorry,
m’lord,
truly,
we’re
full
up,
every
room.”

There
were
four
of
them,
Catelyn
saw.
An
old
man
in
the
black
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
two
servants…
and
him,
standing
there
small
and
bold
as
life.
“My
men
will
steep
in
your
stable,
and
as
for
myself,
well,
I
do
not
require
a
large
room,
as
you
can
plainly
see.”
He
flashed
a
mocking
grin.
“So
long
as
the
fire’s
warm
and
the
straw
reasonably
free
of
fleas,
I
am
a
happy
man.”

Masha
Heddle
was
beside
herself.
“M’lord,
there’s
nothing,
it’s
the
tourney,
there’s
no
help
for
it,
oh…”

Tyrion
Lannister
pulled
a
coin
from
his
purse
and
flicked
it
up
over
his
head,
caught
it,
tossed
it
again.
Even
across
the
room,
where
Catelyn
sat,
the
wink
of
gold
was
unmistakable.

A
freerider
in
a
faded
blue
cloak
lurched
to
his
feet.
“You’re
welcome
to
my
room,
m’lord.”

“Now
there’s
a
clever
man,”
Lannister
said
as
he
sent
the
coin
spinning
across
the
room.
The
freerider
snatched
it
from
the
air.
“And
a
nimble
one
to
boot.”
The
dwarf
turned
back
to
Masha
Heddle.
“You
will
be
able
to
manage
food,
I
trust?”

“Anything
you
like,
m’lord,
anything
at
all,”
the
innkeep
promised.
And
may
he
choke
on
it,
Catelyn
thought,
but
it
was
Bran
she
saw
choking,
drowning
on
his
own
blood.

Lannister
glanced
at
the
nearest
tables.
“My
men
will
have
whatever
you’re
serving
these
people.
Double
portions,
we’ve
had
a
long
hard
ride.
I’ll
take
a
roast
fowl—chicken,
duck,
pigeon,
it
makes
no
matter.
And
send
up
a
flagon
of
your
best
wine.
Yoren,
will
you
sup
with
me?”

“Aye,
m’lord,
I
will,”
the
black
brother
replied.

The
dwarf
had
not
so
much
as
glanced
toward
the
far
end
of
the
room,
and
Catelyn
was
thinking
how
grateful
she
was
for
the
crowded
benches
between
them
when
suddenly
Marillion
bounded
to
his
feet.
“My
lord
of
Lannister!”
he
called
out.
“I
would
be
pleased
to
entertain
you
while
you
eat.
Let
me
sing
you
the
lay
of
your
father’s
great
victory
at
King’s
Landing!”

“Nothing
would
be
more
likely
to
ruin
my
supper,”
the
dwarf
said
dryly.
His
mismatched
eyes
considered
the
singer
briefly,
started
to
move
away…
and
found
Catelyn.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment,
puzzled.
She
turned
her
face
away,
but
too
late.
The
dwarf
was
smiling.
“Lady
Stark,
what
an
unexpected
pleasure,”
he
said.
“I
was
sorry
to
miss
you
at
Winterfell.”

Marillion
gaped
at
her,
confusion
giving
way
to
chagrin
as
Catelyn
rose
slowly
to
her
feet.
She
heard
Ser
Rodrik
curse.
If
only
the
man
had
lingered
at
the
Wall,
she
thought,
if
only…

“Lady…
Stark?”
Masha
Heddle
said
thickly.

“I
was
still
Catelyn
Tully
the
last
time
I
bedded
here,”
she
told
the
innkeep.
She
could
hear
the
muttering,
feel
the
eyes
upon
her.
Catelyn
glanced
around
the
room,
at
the
faces
of
the
knights
and
sworn
swords,
and
took
a
deep
breath
to
slow
the
frantic
beating
of
her
heart.
Did
she
dare
take
the
risk?
There
was
no
time
to
think
it
through,
only
the
moment
and
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
ringing
in
her
ears.
“You
in
the
corner,”
she
said
to
an
older
man
she
had
not
noticed
until
now.
“Is
that
the
black
bat
of
Harrenhal
I
see
embroidered
on
your
surcoat,
ser?”

The
man
got
to
his
feet.
“It
is,
my
lady.”

“And
is
Lady
Whent
a
true
and
honest
friend
to
my
father,
Lord
Hoster
Tully
of
Riverrun?”

“She
is,”
the
man
replied
stoutly.

Ser
Rodrik
rose
quietly
and
loosened
his
sword
in
its
scabbard.
The
dwarf
was
blinking
at
them,
blank-faced,
with
puzzlement
in
his
mismatched
eyes.

“The
red
stallion
was
ever
a
welcome
sight
in
Riverrun,”
she
said
to
the
trio
by
the
fire.
“My
father
counts
Jonos
Bracken
among
his
oldest
and
most
loyal
bannermen.”

The
three
men-at-arms
exchanged
uncertain
looks.
“Our
lord
is
honored
by
his
trust,”
one
of
them
said
hesitantly.

“I
envy
your
father
all
these
fine
friends,”
Lannister
quipped,
“but
I
do
not
quite
see
the
purpose
of
this,
Lady
Stark.”

She
ignored
him,
turning
to
the
large
party
in
blue
and
grey.
They
were
the
heart
of
the
matter;
there
were
more
than
twenty
of
them.
“I
know
your
sigil
as
well:
the
twin
towers
of
Frey.
How
fares
your
good
lord,
sers?”

Their
captain
rose.
“Lord
Walder
is
well,
my
lady.
He
plans
to
take
a
new
wife
on
his
ninetieth
name
day,
and
has
asked
your
lord
father
to
honor
the
wedding
with
his
presence.”

Tyrion
Lannister
sniggered.
That
was
when
Catelyn
knew
he
was
hers.
“This
man
came
a
guest
into
my
house,
and
there
conspired
to
murder
my
son,
a
boy
of
seven,”
she
proclaimed
to
the
room
at
large,
pointing.
Ser
Rodrik
moved
to
her
side,
his
sword
in
hand.
“In
the
name
of
King
Robert
and
the
good
lords
you
serve,
I
call
upon
you
to
seize
him
and
help
me
return
him
to
Winterfell
to
await
the
king’s
justice.”

She
did
not
know
what
was
more
satisfying:
the
sound
of
a
dozen
swords
drawn
as
one
or
the
look
on
Tyrion
Lannister’s
face.





SANSA

Sansa
rode
to
the
Hand’s
tourney
with
Septa
Mordane
and
Jeyne
Poole,
in
a
litter
with
curtains
of
yellow
silk
so
fine
she
could
see
right
through
them.
They
turned
the
whole
world
gold.
Beyond
the
city
walls,
a
hundred
pavilions
had
been
raised
beside
the
river,
and
the
common
folk
came
out
in
the
thousands
to
watch
the
games.
The
splendor
of
it
all
took
Sansa’s
breath
away;
the
shining
armor,
the
great
chargers
caparisoned
in
silver
and
gold,
the
shouts
of
the
crowd,
the
banners
snapping
in
the
wind…
and
the
knights
themselves,
the
knights
most
of
all.

“It
is
better
than
the
songs,”
she
whispered
when
they
found
the
places
that
her
father
had
promised
her,
among
the
high
lords
and
ladies.
Sansa
was
dressed
beautifully
that
day,
in
a
green
gown
that
brought
out
the
auburn
of
her
hair,
and
she
knew
they
were
looking
at
her
and
smiling.

They
watched
the
heroes
of
a
hundred
songs
ride
forth,
each
more
fabulous
than
the
last.
The
seven
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
took
the
field,
all
but
Jaime
Lannister
in
scaled
armor
the
color
of
milk,
their
cloaks
as
white
as
freshfallen
snow.
Ser
Jaime
wore
the
white
cloak
as
well,
but
beneath
it
he
was
shining
gold
from
head
to
foot,
with
a
lion’s-head
helm
and
a
golden
sword.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane,
the
Mountain
That
Rides,
thundered
past
them
like
an
avalanche.
Sansa
remembered
Lord
Yohn
Royce,
who
had
guested
at
Winterfell
two
years
before.
“His
armor
is
bronze,
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
old,
engraved
with
magic
runes
that
ward
him
against
harm,”
she
whispered
to
Jeyne.
Septa
Mordane
pointed
out
Lord
Jason
Mallister,
in
indigo
chased
with
silver,
the
wings
of
an
eagle
on
his
helm.
He
had
cut
down
three
of
Rhaegar’s
bannermen
on
the
Trident.
The
girls
giggled
over
the
warrior
priest
Thoros
of
Myr,
with
his
flapping
red
robes
and
shaven
head,
until
the
septa
told
them
that
he
had
once
scaled
the
walls
of
Pyke
with
a
flaming
sword
in
hand.

Other
riders
Sansa
did
not
know;
hedge
knights
from
the
Fingers
and
Highgarden
and
the
mountains
of
Dorne,
unsung
freeriders
and
new-made
squires,
the
younger
sons
of
high
lords
and
the
heirs
of
lesser
houses.
Younger
men,
most
had
done
no
great
deeds
as
yet,
but
Sansa
and
Jeyne
agreed
that
one
day
the
Seven
Kingdoms
would
resound
to
the
sound
of
their
names.
Ser
Balon
Swann.
Lord
Bryce
Caron
of
the
Marches.
Bronze
Yohn’s
heir,
Ser
Andar
Royce,
and
his
younger
brother
Ser
Robar,
their
silvered
steel
plate
filigreed
in
bronze
with
the
same
ancient
runes
that
warded
their
father.
The
twins
Ser
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber,
whose
shields
displayed
the
grape
cluster
sigil
of
the
Redwynes,
burgundy
on
blue.
Patrek
Mallister,
Lord
Jason’s
son.
Six
Freys
of
the
Crossing:
Ser
Jared,
Ser
Hosteen,
Ser
Danwell,
Ser
Emmon,
Ser
Theo,
Ser
Perwyn,
sons
and
grandsons
of
old
Lord
Walder
Frey,
and
his
bastard
son
Martyn
Rivers
as
well.

Jeyne
Poole
confessed
herself
frightened
by
the
look
of
Jalabhar
Xho,
an
exile
prince
from
the
Summer
Isles
who
wore
a
cape
of
green
and
scarlet
feathers
over
skin
as
dark
as
night,
but
when
she
saw
young
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion,
with
his
hair
like
red
gold
and
his
black
shield
slashed
by
lightning,
she
pronounced
herself
willing
to
marry
him
on
the
instant.

The
Hound
entered
the
lists
as
well,
and
so
too
the
king’s
brother,
handsome
Lord
Renly
of
Storm’s
End.
Jory,
Alyn,
and
Harwin
rode
for
Winterfell
and
the
north.
“Jory
looks
a
beggar
among
these
others,”
Septa
Mordane
sniffed
when
he
appeared.
Sansa
could
only
agree.
Jory’s
armor
was
blue-grey
plate
without
device
or
ornament,
and
a
thin
grey
cloak
hung
from
his
shoulders
like
a
soiled
rag.
Yet
he
acquitted
himself
well,
unhorsing
Horas
Redwyne
in
his
first
joust
and
one
of
the
Freys
in
his
second.
In
his
third
match,
he
rode
three
passes
at
a
freerider
named
Lothor
Brune
whose
armor
was
as
drab
as
his
own.
Neither
man
lost
his
seat,
but
Brune’s
lance
was
steadier
and
his
blows
better
placed,
and
the
king
gave
him
the
victory.
Alyn
and
Harwin
fared
less
well;
Harwin
was
unhorsed
in
his
first
tilt
by
Ser
Meryn
of
the
Kingsguard,
while
Alyn
fell
to
Ser
Balon
Swann.

The
jousting
went
all
day
and
into
the
dusk,
the
hooves
of
the
great
warhorses
pounding
down
the
lists
until
the
field
was
a
ragged
wasteland
of
torn
earth.
A
dozen
times
Jeyne
and
Sansa
cried
out
in
unison
as
riders
crashed
together,
lances
exploding
into
splinters
while
the
commons
screamed
for
their
favorites.
Jeyne
covered
her
eyes
whenever
a
man
fell,
like
a
frightened
little
girl,
but
Sansa
was
made
of
sterner
stuff.
A
great
lady
knew
how
to
behave
at
tournaments.
Even
Septa
Mordane
noted
her
composure
and
nodded
in
approval.

The
Kingslayer
rode
brilliantly.
He
overthrew
Ser
Andar
Royce
and
the
Marcher
Lord
Bryce
Caron
as
easily
as
if
he
were
riding
at
rings,
and
then
took
a
hard-fought
match
from
white-haired
Barristan
Selmy,
who
had
won
his
first
two
tilts
against
men
thirty
and
forty
years
his
junior.

Sandor
Clegane
and
his
immense
brother,
Ser
Gregor
the
Mountain,
seemed
unstoppable
as
well,
riding
down
one
foe
after
the
next
in
ferocious
style.
The
most
terrifying
moment
of
the
day
came
during
Ser
Gregor’s
second
joust,
when
his
lance
rode
up
and
struck
a
young
knight
from
the
Vale
under
the
gorget
with
such
force
that
it
drove
through
his
throat,
killing
him
instantly.
The
youth
fell
not
ten
feet
from
where
Sansa
was
seated.
The
point
of
Ser
Gregor’s
lance
had
snapped
off
in
his
neck,
and
his
life’s
blood
flowed
out
in
slow
pulses,
each
weaker
than
the
one
before.
His
armor
was
shiny
new;
a
bright
streak
of
fire
ran
down
his
outstretched
arm,
as
the
steel
caught
the
light.
Then
the
sun
went
behind
a
cloud,
and
it
was
gone.
His
cloak
was
blue,
the
color
of
the
sky
on
a
clear
summer’s
day,
trimmed
with
a
border
of
crescent
moons,
but
as
his
blood
seeped
into
it,
the
cloth
darkened
and
the
moons
turned
red,
one
by
one.

Jeyne
Poole
wept
so
hysterically
that
Septa
Mordane
finally
took
her
off
to
regain
her
composure,
but
Sansa
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap,
watching
with
a
strange
fascination.
She
had
never
seen
a
man
die
before.
She
ought
to
be
crying
too,
she
thought,
but
the
tears
would
not
come.
Perhaps
she
had
used
up
all
her
tears
for
Lady
and
Bran.
It
would
be
different
if
it
had
been
Jory
or
Ser
Rodrik
or
Father,
she
told
herself.
The
young
knight
in
the
blue
cloak
was
nothing
to
her,
some
stranger
from
the
Vale
of
Arryn
whose
name
she
had
forgotten
as
soon
as
she
heard
it.
And
now
the
world
would
forget
his
name
too,
Sansa
realized;
there
would
be
no
songs
sung
for
him.
That
was
sad.

After
they
carried
off
the
body,
a
boy
with
a
spade
ran
onto
the
field
and
shoveled
dirt
over
the
spot
where
he
had
fallen,
to
cover
up
the
blood.
Then
the
jousts
resumed.

Ser
Balon
Swann
also
fell
to
Gregor,
and
Lord
Renly
to
the
Hound.
Renly
was
unhorsed
so
violently
that
he
seemed
to
fly
backward
off
his
charger,
legs
in
the
air.
His
head
hit
the
ground
with
an
audible
crack
that
made
the
crowd
gasp,
but
it
was
just
the
golden
antler
on
his
helm.
One
of
the
tines
had
snapped
off
beneath
him.
When
Lord
Renly
climbed
to
his
feet,
the
commons
cheered
wildly,
for
King
Robert’s
handsome
young
brother
was
a
great
favorite.
He
handed
the
broken
tine
to
his
conqueror
with
a
gracious
bow.
The
Hound
snorted
and
tossed
the
broken
antler
into
the
crowd,
where
the
commons
began
to
punch
and
claw
over
the
little
bit
of
gold,
until
Lord
Renly
walked
out
among
them
and
restored
the
peace.
By
then
Septa
Mordane
had
returned,
alone.
Jeyne
had
been
feeling
ill,
she
explained;
she
had
helped
her
back
to
the
castle.
Sansa
had
almost
forgotten
about
Jeyne.

Later
a
hedge
knight
in
a
checkered
cloak
disgraced
himself
by
killing
Beric
Dondarrion’s
horse,
and
was
declared
forfeit.
Lord
Beric
shifted
his
saddle
to
a
new
mount,
only
to
be
knocked
right
off
it
by
Thoros
of
Myr.
Ser
Aron
Santagar
and
Lothor
Brune
tilted
thrice
without
result;
Ser
Aron
fell
afterward
to
Lord
Jason
Mallister,
and
Brune
to
Yohn
Royce’s
younger
son,
Robar.

In
the
end
it
came
down
to
four;
the
Hound
and
his
monstrous
brother
Gregor,
Jaime
Lannister
the
Kingslayer,
and
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
the
youth
they
called
the
Knight
of
Flowers.

Ser
Loras
was
the
youngest
son
of
Mace
Tyrell,
the
Lord
of
Highgarden
and
Warden
of
the
South.
At
sixteen,
he
was
the
youngest
rider
on
the
field,
yet
he
had
unhorsed
three
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
that
morning
in
his
first
three
jousts.
Sansa
had
never
seen
anyone
so
beautiful.
His
plate
was
intricately
fashioned
and
enameled
as
a
bouquet
of
a
thousand
different
flowers,
and
his
snow-white
stallion
was
draped
in
a
blanket
of
red
and
white
roses.
After
each
victory,
Ser
Loras
would
remove
his
helm
and
ride
slowly
round
the
fence,
and
finally
pluck
a
single
white
rose
from
the
blanket
and
toss
it
to
some
fair
maiden
in
the
crowd.

His
last
match
of
the
day
was
against
the
younger
Royce.
Ser
Robar’s
ancestral
runes
proved
small
protection
as
Ser
Loras
split
his
shield
and
drove
him
from
his
saddle
to
crash
with
an
awful
clangor
in
the
dirt.
Robar
lay
moaning
as
the
victor
made
his
circuit
of
the
field.
Finally
they
called
for
a
litter
and
carried
him
off
to
his
tent,
dazed
and
unmoving.
Sansa
never
saw
it.
Her
eyes
were
only
for
Ser
Loras.
When
the
white
horse
stopped
in
front
of
her,
she
thought
her
heart
would
burst.

To
the
other
maidens
he
had
given
white
roses,
but
the
one
he
plucked
for
her
was
red.
“Sweet
lady,”
he
said,
“no
victory
is
half
so
beautiful
as
you.”
Sansa
took
the
flower
timidly,
struck
dumb
by
his
gallantry.
His
hair
was
a
mass
of
lazy
brown
curls,
his
eyes
like
liquid
gold.
She
inhaled
the
sweet
fragrance
of
the
rose
and
sat
clutching
it
long
after
Ser
Loras
had
ridden
off.

When
Sansa
finally
looked
up,
a
man
was
standing
over
her,
staring.
He
was
short,
with
a
pointed
beard
and
a
silver
streak
in
his
hair,
almost
as
old
as
her
father.
“You
must
be
one
of
her
daughters,”
he
said
to
her.
He
had
grey-green
eyes
that
did
not
smile
when
his
mouth
did.
“You
have
the
Tully
look.”

“I’m
Sansa
Stark,”
she
said,
ill
at
ease.
The
man
wore
a
heavy
cloak
with
a
fur
collar,
fastened
with
a
silver
mockingbird,
and
he
had
the
effortless
manner
of
a
high
lord,
but
she
did
not
know
him.
“I
have
not
had
the
honor,
my
lord.”

Septa
Mordane
quickly
took
a
hand.
“Sweet
child,
this
is
Lord
Petyr
Baelish,
of
the
king’s
small
council.”

“Your
mother
was
my
queen
of
beauty
once,”
the
man
said
quietly.
His
breath
smelled
of
mint.
“You
have
her
hair.”
His
fingers
brushed
against
her
cheek
as
he
stroked
one
auburn
lock.
Quite
abruptly
he
turned
and
walked
away.

By
then,
the
moon
was
well
up
and
the
crowd
was
tired,
so
the
king
decreed
that
the
last
three
matches
would
be
fought
the
next
morning,
before
the
melee.
While
the
commons
began
their
walk
home,
talking
of
the
day’s
jousts
and
the
matches
to
come
on
the
morrow,
the
court
moved
to
the
riverside
to
begin
the
feast.
Six
monstrous
huge
aurochs
had
been
roasting
for
hours,
turning
slowly
on
wooden
spits
while
kitchen
boys
basted
them
with
butter
and
herbs
until
the
meat
crackled
and
spit.
Tables
and
benches
had
been
raised
outside
the
pavilions,
piled
high
with
sweetgrass
and
strawberries
and
fresh-baked
bread.

Sansa
and
Septa
Mordane
were
given
places
of
high
honor,
to
the
left
of
the
raised
dais
where
the
king
himself
sat
beside
his
queen.
When
Prince
Joffrey
seated
himself
to
her
right,
she
felt
her
throat
tighten.
He
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
her
since
the
awful
thing
had
happened,
and
she
had
not
dared
to
speak
to
him.
At
first
she
thought
she
hated
him
for
what
they’d
done
to
Lady,
but
after
Sansa
had
wept
her
eyes
dry,
she
told
herself
that
it
had
not
been
Joffrey’s
doing,
not
truly.
The
queen
had
done
it;
she
was
the
one
to
hate,
her
and
Arya.
Nothing
bad
would
have
happened
except
for
Arya.

She
could
not
hate
Joffrey
tonight.
He
was
too
beautiful
to
hate.
He
wore
a
deep
blue
doublet
studded
with
a
double
row
of
golden
lion’s
heads,
and
around
his
brow
a
slim
coronet
made
of
gold
and
sapphires.
His
hair
was
as
bright
as
the
metal.
Sansa
looked
at
him
and
trembled,
afraid
that
he
might
ignore
her
or,
worse,
turn
hateful
again
and
send
her
weeping
from
the
table.

Instead
Joffrey
smiled
and
kissed
her
hand,
handsome
and
gallant
as
any
prince
in
the
songs,
and
said,
“Ser
Loras
has
a
keen
eye
for
beauty,
sweet
lady.”

“He
was
too
kind,”
she
demurred,
trying
to
remain
modest
and
calm,
though
her
heart
was
singing.
“Ser
Loras
is
a
true
knight.
Do
you
think
he
will
win
tomorrow,
my
lord?”

“No,”
Joffrey
said.
“My
dog
will
do
for
him,
or
perhaps
my
uncle
Jaime.
And
in
a
few
years,
when
I
am
old
enough
to
enter
the
lists,
I
shall
do
for
them
all.”
He
raised
his
hand
to
summon
a
servant
with
a
flagon
of
iced
summerwine,
and
poured
her
a
cup.
She
looked
anxiously
at
Septa
Mordane,
until
Joffrey
leaned
over
and
filled
the
septa’s
cup
as
well,
so
she
nodded
and
thanked
him
graciously
and
said
not
another
word.

The
servants
kept
the
cups
filled
all
night,
yet
afterward
Sansa
could
not
recall
ever
tasting
the
wine.
She
needed
no
wine.
She
was
drunk
on
the
magic
of
the
night,
giddy
with
glamour,
swept
away
by
beauties
she
had
dreamt
of
all
her
life
and
never
dared
hope
to
know.
Singers
sat
before
the
king’s
pavilion,
filling
the
dusk
with
music.
A
juggler
kept
a
cascade
of
burning
clubs
spinning
through
the
air.
The
king’s
own
fool,
the
pie-faced
simpleton
called
Moon
Boy,
danced
about
on
stilts,
all
in
motley,
making
mock
of
everyone
with
such
deft
cruelty
that
Sansa
wondered
if
he
was
simple
after
all.
Even
Septa
Mordane
was
helpless
before
him;
when
he
sang
his
little
song
about
the
High
Septon,
she
laughed
so
hard
she
spilled
wine
on
herself.

And
Joffrey
was
the
soul
of
courtesy.
He
talked
to
Sansa
all
night,
showering
her
with
compliments,
making
her
laugh,
sharing
little
bits
of
court
gossip,
explaining
Moon
Boy’s
japes.
Sansa
was
so
captivated
that
she
quite
forgot
all
her
courtesies
and
ignored
Septa
Mordane,
seated
to
her
left.

All
the
while
the
courses
came
and
went.
A
thick
soup
of
barley
and
venison.
Salads
of
sweetgrass
and
spinach
and
plums,
sprinkled
with
crushed
nuts.
Snails
in
honey
and
garlic.
Sansa
had
never
eaten
snails
before;
Joffrey
showed
her
how
to
get
the
snail
out
of
the
shell,
and
fed
her
the
first
sweet
morsel
himself.
Then
came
trout
fresh
from
the
river,
baked
in
clay;
her
prince
helped
her
crack
open
the
hard
casing
to
expose
the
flaky
white
flesh
within.
And
when
the
meat
course
was
brought
out,
he
served
her
himself,
slicing
a
queen’s
portion
from
the
joint,
smiling
as
he
laid
it
on
her
plate.
She
could
see
from
the
way
he
moved
that
his
right
arm
was
still
troubling
him,
yet
he
uttered
not
a
word
of
complaint.

Later
came
sweetbreads
and
pigeon
pie
and
baked
apples
fragrant
with
cinnamon
and
lemon
cakes
frosted
in
sugar,
but
by
then
Sansa
was
so
stuffed
that
she
could
not
manage
more
than
two
little
lemon
cakes,
as
much
as
she
loved
them.
She
was
wondering
whether
she
might
attempt
a
third
when
the
king
began
to
shout.

King
Robert
had
grown
louder
with
each
course.
From
time
to
time
Sansa
could
hear
him
laughing
or
roaring
a
command
over
the
music
and
the
clangor
of
plates
and
cutlery,
but
they
were
too
far
away
for
her
to
make
out
his
words.

Now
everybody
heard
him.
“No,”
he
thundered
in
a
voice
that
drowned
out
all
other
speech.
Sansa
was
shocked
to
see
the
king
on
his
feet,
red
of
face,
reeling.
He
had
a
goblet
of
wine
in
one
hand,
and
he
was
drunk
as
a
man
could
be.
“You
do
not
tell
me
what
to
do,
woman,”
he
screamed
at
Queen
Cersei.
“I
am
king
here,
do
you
understand?
I
rule
here,
and
if
I
say
that
I
will
fight
tomorrow,
I
will
fight!”

Everyone
was
staring.
Sansa
saw
Ser
Barristan,
and
the
king’s
brother
Renly,
and
the
short
man
who
had
talked
to
her
so
oddly
and
touched
her
hair,
but
no
one
made
a
move
to
interfere.
The
queen’s
face
was
a
mask,
so
bloodless
that
it
might
have
been
sculpted
from
snow.
She
rose
from
the
table,
gathered
her
skirts
around
her,
and
stormed
off
in
silence,
servants
trailing
behind.

Jaime
Lannister
put
a
hand
on
the
king’s
shoulder,
but
the
king
shoved
him
away
hard.
Lannister
stumbled
and
fell.
The
king
guffawed.
“The
great
knight.
I
can
still
knock
you
in
the
dirt.
Remember
that,
Kingslayer.”
He
slapped
his
chest
with
the
jeweled
goblet,
splashing
wine
all
over
his
satin
tunic.
“Give
me
my
hammer
and
not
a
man
in
the
realm
can
stand
before
me!”

Jaime
Lannister
rose
and
brushed
himself
off.
“As
you
say,
Your
Grace.”
His
voice
was
stiff.

Lord
Renly
came
forward,
smiling.
“You’ve
spilled
your
wine,
Robert.
Let
me
bring
you
a
fresh
goblet.”

Sansa
started
as
Joffrey
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm.
“It
grows
late,”
the
prince
said.
He
had
a
queer
look
on
his
face,
as
if
he
were
not
seeing
her
at
all.
“Do
you
need
an
escort
back
to
the
castle?”

“No,”
Sansa
began.
She
looked
for
Septa
Mordane,
and
was
startled
to
find
her
with
her
head
on
the
table,
snoring
soft
and
ladylike
snores.
“I
mean
to
say…
yes,
thank
you,
that
would
be
most
kind.
I
am
tired,
and
the
way
is
so
dark.
I
should
be
glad
for
some
protection.”

Joffrey
called
out,
“Dog!”

Sandor
Clegane
seemed
to
take
form
out
of
the
night,
so
quickly
did
he
appear.
He
had
exchanged
his
armor
for
a
red
woolen
tunic
with
a
leather
dog’s
head
sewn
on
the
front.
The
light
of
the
torches
made
his
burned
face
shine
a
dull
red.
“Yes,
Your
Grace?”
he
said.

“Take
my
betrothed
back
to
the
castle,
and
see
that
no
harm
befalls
her,”
the
prince
told
him
brusquely.
And
without
even
a
word
of
farewell,
Joffrey
strode
off,
leaving
her
there.

Sansa
could
feel
the
Hound
watching
her.
“Did
you
think
Joff
was
going
to
take
you
himself?”
He
laughed.
He
had
a
laugh
like
the
snarling
of
dogs
in
a
pit.
“Small
chance
of
that.”
He
pulled
her
unresisting
to
her
feet.
“Come,
you’re
not
the
only
one
needs
sleep.
I’ve
drunk
too
much,
and
I
may
need
to
kill
my
brother
tomorrow.”
He
laughed
again.

Suddenly
terrified,
Sansa
pushed
at
Septa
Mordane’s
shoulder,
hoping
to
wake
her,
but
she
only
snored
the
louder.
King
Robert
had
stumbled
off
and
half
the
benches
were
suddenly
empty.
The
feast
was
over,
and
the
beautiful
dream
had
ended
with
it.

The
Hound
snatched
up
a
torch
to
light
their
way.
Sansa
followed
close
beside
him.
The
ground
was
rocky
and
uneven;
the
flickering
light
made
it
seem
to
shift
and
move
beneath
her.
She
kept
her
eyes
lowered,
watching
where
she
placed
her
feet.
They
walked
among
the
pavilions,
each
with
its
banner
and
its
armor
hung
outside,
the
silence
weighing
heavier
with
every
step.
Sansa
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
him,
he
frightened
her
so,
yet
she
had
been
raised
in
all
the
ways
of
courtesy.
A
true
lady
would
not
notice
his
face,
she
told
herself.
“You
rode
gallantly
today,
Ser
Sandor,”
she
made
herself
say.

Sandor
Clegane
snarled
at
her.
“Spare
me
your
empty
little
compliments,
girl…
and
your
ser’s.
I
am
no
knight.
I
spit
on
them
and
their
vows.
My
brother
is
a
knight.
Did
you
see
him
ride
today?”

“Yes,”
Sansa
whispered,
trembling.
“He
was…

“Gallant?”
the
Hound
finished.

He
was
mocking
her,
she
realized.
“No
one
could
withstand
him,”
she
managed
at
last,
proud
of
herself.
It
was
no
lie.

Sandor
Clegane
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
and
empty
field.
She
had
no
choice
but
to
stop
beside
him.
“Some
septa
trained
you
well.
You’re
like
one
of
those
birds
from
the
Summer
Isles,
aren’t
you?
A
pretty
little
talking
bird,
repeating
all
the
pretty
little
words
they
taught
you
to
recite.”

“That’s
unkind.”
Sansa
could
feel
her
heart
fluttering
in
her
chest.
“You’re
frightening
me.
I
want
to
go
now.”

“No
one
could
withstand
him,”
the
Hound
rasped.
“That’s
truth
enough.
No
one
could
ever
withstand
Gregor.
That
boy
today,
his
second
joust,
oh,
that
was
a
pretty
bit
of
business.
You
saw
that,
did
you?
Fool
boy,
he
had
no
business
riding
in
this
company.
No
money,
no
squire,
no
one
to
help
him
with
that
armor.
That
gorget
wasn’t
fastened
proper.
You
think
Gregor
didn’t
notice
that?
You
think
Ser
Gregor’s
lance
rode
up
by
chance,
do
you?
Pretty
little
talking
girl,
you
believe
that,
you’re
empty-headed
as
a
bird
for
true.
Gregor’s
lance
goes
where
Gregor
wants
it
to
go.
Look
at
me.
Look
at
me!”
Sandor
Clegane
put
a
huge
hand
under
her
chin
and
forced
her
face
up.
He
squatted
in
front
of
her,
and
moved
the
torch
close.
“There’s
a
pretty
for
you.
Take
a
good
long
stare.
You
know
you
want
to.
I’ve
watched
you
turning
away
all
the
way
down
the
kingsroad.
Piss
on
that.
Take
your
look.”

His
fingers
held
her
jaw
as
hard
as
an
iron
trap.
His
eyes
watched
hers.
Drunken
eyes,
sullen
with
anger.
She
had
to
look.

The
right
side
of
his
face
was
gaunt,
with
sharp
cheekbones
and
a
grey
eye
beneath
a
heavy
brow.
His
nose
was
large
and
hooked,
his
hair
thin,
dark.
He
wore
it
long
and
brushed
it
sideways,
because
no
hair
grew
on
the
other
side
of
that
face.

The
left
side
of
his
face
was
a
ruin.
His
ear
had
been
burned
away;
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
hole.
His
eye
was
still
good,
but
all
around
it
was
a
twisted
mass
of
scar,
slick
black
flesh
hard
as
leather,
pocked
with
craters
and
fissured
by
deep
cracks
that
gleamed
red
and
wet
when
he
moved.
Down
by
his
jaw,
you
could
see
a
hint
of
bone
where
the
flesh
had
been
seared
away.

Sansa
began
to
cry.
He
let
go
of
her
then,
and
snuffed
out
the
torch
in
the
dirt.
“No
pretty
words
for
that,
girl?
No
little
compliment
the
septa
taught
you?”
When
there
was
no
answer,
he
continued.
“Most
of
them,
they
think
it
was
some
battle.
A
siege,
a
burning
tower,
an
enemy
with
a
torch.
One
fool
asked
if
it
was
dragonsbreath.”
His
laugh
was
softer
this
time,
but
just
as
bitter.
“I’ll
tell
you
what
it
was,
girl,”
he
said,
a
voice
from
the
night,
a
shadow
leaning
so
close
now
that
she
could
smell
the
sour
stench
of
wine
on
his
breath.
“I
was
younger
than
you,
six,
maybe
seven.
A
woodcarver
set
up
shop
in
the
village
under
my
father’s
keep,
and
to
buy
favor
he
sent
us
gifts.
The
old
man
made
marvelous
toys.
I
don’t
remember
what
I
got,
but
it
was
Gregor’s
gift
I
wanted.
A
wooden
knight,
all
painted
up,
every
joint
pegged
separate
and
fixed
with
strings,
so
you
could
make
him
fight.
Gregor
is
five
years
older
than
me,
the
toy
was
nothing
to
him,
he
was
already
a
squire,
near
six
foot
tall
and
muscled
like
an
ox.
So
I
took
his
knight,
but
there
was
no
joy
to
it,
I
tell
you.
I
was
scared
all
the
while,
and
true
enough,
he
found
me.
There
was
a
brazier
in
the
room.
Gregor
never
said
a
word,
just
picked
me
up
under
his
arm
and
shoved
the
side
of
my
face
down
in
the
burning
coals
and
held
me
there
while
I
screamed
and
screamed.
You
saw
how
strong
he
is.
Even
then,
it
took
three
grown
men
to
drag
him
off
me.
The
septons
preach
about
the
seven
hells.
What
do
they
know?
Only
a
man
who’s
been
burned
knows
what
hell
is
truly
like.

“My
father
told
everyone
my
bedding
had
caught
fire,
and
our
maester
gave
me
ointments.
Ointments!
Gregor
got
his
ointments
too.
Four
years
later,
they
anointed
him
with
the
seven
oils
and
he
recited
his
knightly
vows
and
Rhaegar
Targaryen
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said,
‘Arise,
Ser
Gregor.’”

The
rasping
voice
trailed
off.
He
squatted
silently
before
her,
a
hulking
black
shape
shrouded
in
the
night,
hidden
from
her
eyes.
Sansa
could
hear
his
ragged
breathing.
She
was
sad
for
him,
she
realized.
Somehow,
the
fear
had
gone
away.

The
silence
went
on
and
on,
so
long
that
she
began
to
grow
afraid
once
more,
but
she
was
afraid
for
him
now,
not
for
herself.
She
found
his
massive
shoulder
with
her
hand.
“He
was
no
true
knight,”
she
whispered
to
him.

The
Hound
threw
back
his
head
and
roared.
Sansa
stumbled
back,
away
from
him,
but
he
caught
her
arm.
“No,”
he
growled
at
her,
“no,
little
bird,
he
was
no
true
knight.”

The
rest
of
the
way
into
the
city,
Sandor
Clegane
said
not
a
word.
He
led
her
to
where
the
carts
were
waiting,
told
a
driver
to
take
them
back
to
the
Red
Keep,
and
climbed
in
after
her.
They
rode
in
silence
through
the
King’s
Gate
and
up
torchlit
city
streets.
He
opened
the
postern
door
and
led
her
into
the
castle,
his
burned
face
twitching
and
his
eyes
brooding,
and
he
was
one
step
behind
her
as
they
climbed
the
tower
stairs.
He
took
her
safe
all
the
way
to
the
corridor
outside
her
bedchamber.

“Thank
you,
my
lord,”
Sansa
said
meekly.

The
Hound
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
leaned
close.
“The
things
I
told
you
tonight,”
he
said,
his
voice
sounding
even
rougher
than
usual.
“If
you
ever
tell
Joffrey…
your
sister,
your
father…
any
of
them…”

“I
won’t,”
Sansa
whispered.
“I
promise.”

It
was
not
enough.
“If
you
ever
tell
anyone,”
he
finished,
“I’ll
kill
you.”





EDDARD

“I
stood
last
vigil
for
him
myself,”
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
said
as
they
looked
down
at
the
body
in
the
back
of
the
cart.
“He
had
no
one
else.
A
mother
in
the
Vale,
I
am
told.”

In
the
pale
dawn
light,
the
young
knight
looked
as
though
he
were
sleeping.
He
had
not
been
handsome,
but
death
had
smoothed
his
rough-hewn
features
and
the
silent
sisters
had
dressed
him
in
his
best
velvet
tunic,
with
a
high
collar
to
cover
the
ruin
the
lance
had
made
of
his
throat.
Eddard
Stark
looked
at
his
face,
and
wondered
if
it
had
been
for
his
sake
that
the
boy
had
died.
Slain
by
a
Lannister
bannerman
before
Ned
could
speak
to
him;
could
that
be
mere
happenstance?
He
supposed
he
would
never
know.

“Hugh
was
Jon
Arryn’s
squire
for
four
years,”
Selmy
went
on.
“The
king
knighted
him
before
he
rode
north,
in
Jon’s
memory.
The
lad
wanted
it
desperately,
yet
I
fear
he
was
not
ready.”

Ned
had
slept
badly
last
night
and
he
felt
tired
beyond
his
years.
“None
of
us
is
ever
ready,”
he
said.

“For
knighthood?”

“For
death.”
Gently
Ned
covered
the
boy
with
his
cloak,
a
bloodstained
bit
of
blue
bordered
in
crescent
moons.
When
his
mother
asked
why
her
son
was
dead,
he
reflected
bitterly,
they
would
tell
her
he
had
fought
to
honor
the
King’s
Hand,
Eddard
Stark.
“This
was
needless.
War
should
not
be
a
game.”
Ned
turned
to
the
woman
beside
the
cart,
shrouded
in
grey,
face
hidden
but
for
her
eyes.
The
silent
sisters
prepared
men
for
the
grave,
and
it
was
ill
fortune
to
look
on
the
face
of
death.
“Send
his
armor
home
to
the
Vale.
The
mother
will
want
to
have
it.”

“It
is
worth
a
fair
piece
of
silver,”
Ser
Barristan
said.
“The
boy
had
it
forged
special
for
the
tourney.
Plain
work,
but
good.
I
do
not
know
if
he
had
finished
paying
the
smith.”

“He
paid
yesterday,
my
lord,
and
he
paid
dearly,”
Ned
replied.
And
to
the
silent
sister
he
said,
“Send
the
mother
the
armor.
I
will
deal
with
this
smith.”
She
bowed
her
head.

Afterward
Ser
Barristan
walked
with
Ned
to
the
king’s
pavilion.
The
camp
was
beginning
to
stir.
Fat
sausages
sizzled
and
spit
over
firepits,
spicing
the
air
with
the
scents
of
garlic
and
pepper.
Young
squires
hurried
about
on
errands
as
their
masters
woke,
yawning
and
stretching,
to
meet
the
day.
A
serving
man
with
a
goose
under
his
arm
bent
his
knee
when
he
caught
sight
of
them.
“M’lords,”
he
muttered
as
the
goose
honked
and
pecked
at
his
fingers.
The
shields
displayed
outside
each
tent
heralded
its
occupant:
the
silver
eagle
of
Seagard,
Bryce
Caron’s
field
of
nightingales,
a
cluster
of
grapes
for
the
Redwynes,
brindled
boar,
red
ox,
burning
tree,
white
ram,
triple
spiral,
purple
unicorn,
dancing
maiden,
blackadder,
twin
towers,
horned
owl,
and
last
the
pure
white
blazons
of
the
Kingsguard,
shining
like
the
dawn.

“The
king
means
to
fight
in
the
melee
today,”
Ser
Barristan
said
as
they
were
passing
Ser
Meryn’s
shield,
its
paint
sullied
by
a
deep
gash
where
Loras
Tyrell’s
lance
had
scarred
the
wood
as
he
drove
him
from
his
saddle.

“Yes,”
Ned
said
grimly.
Jory
had
woken
him
last
night
to
bring
him
that
news.
Small
wonder
he
had
slept
so
badly.

Ser
Barristan’s
look
was
troubled.
“They
say
night’s
beauties
fade
at
dawn,
and
the
children
of
wine
are
oft
disowned
in
the
morning
light.”

“They
say
so,”
Ned
agreed,
“but
not
of
Robert.”
Other
men
might
reconsider
words
spoken
in
drunken
bravado,
but
Robert
Baratheon
would
remember
and,
remembering,
would
never
back
down.

The
king’s
pavilion
was
close
by
the
water,
and
the
morning
mists
off
the
river
had
wreathed
it
in
wisps
of
grey.
It
was
all
of
golden
silk,
the
largest
and
grandest
structure
in
the
camp.
Outside
the
entrance,
Robert’s
warhammer
was
displayed
beside
an
immense
iron
shield
blazoned
with
the
crowned
stag
of
House
Baratheon.

Ned
had
hoped
to
discover
the
king
still
abed
in
a
wine-soaked
sleep,
but
luck
was
not
with
him.
They
found
Robert
drinking
beer
from
a
polished
horn
and
roaring
his
displeasure
at
two
young
squires
who
were
trying
to
buckle
him
into
his
armor.
“Your
Grace,”
one
was
saying,
almost
in
tears,
“it’s
made
too
small,
it
won’t
go.”
He
fumbled,
and
the
gorget
he
was
trying
to
fit
around
Robert’s
thick
neck
tumbled
to
the
ground.

“Seven
hells!”
Robert
swore.
“Do
I
have
to
do
it
myself?
Piss
on
the
both
of
you.
Pick
it
up.
Don’t
just
stand
there
gaping,
Lancel,
pick
it
up!”
The
lad
jumped,
and
the
king
noticed
his
company.
“Look
at
these
oafs,
Ned.
My
wife
insisted
I
take
these
two
to
squire
for
me,
and
they’re
worse
than
useless.
Can’t
even
put
a
man’s
armor
on
him
properly.
Squires,
they
say.
I
say
they’re
swineherds
dressed
up
in
silk.”

Ned
only
needed
a
glance
to
understand
the
difficulty.
“The
boys
are
not
at
fault,”
he
told
the
king.
“You’re
too
fat
for
your
armor,
Robert.”

Robert
Baratheon
took
a
long
swallow
of
beer,
tossed
the
empty
horn
onto
his
sleeping
furs,
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand,
and
said
darkly,
“Fat?
Fat,
is
it?
Is
that
how
you
speak
to
your
king?”
He
let
go
his
laughter,
sudden
as
a
storm.
“Ah,
damn
you,
Ned,
why
are
you
always
right?”

The
squires
smiled
nervously
until
the
king
turned
on
them.
“You.
Yes,
both
of
you.
You
heard
the
Hand.
The
king
is
too
fat
for
his
armor.
Go
find
Ser
Aron
Santagar.
Tell
him
I
need
the
breastplate
stretcher.
Now!
What
are
you
waiting
for?”

The
boys
tripped
over
each
other
in
their
haste
to
be
quit
of
the
tent.
Robert
managed
to
keep
a
stern
face
until
they
were
gone.
Then
he
dropped
back
into
a
chair,
shaking
with
laughter.

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
chuckled
with
him.
Even
Eddard
Stark
managed
a
smile.
Always,
though,
the
graver
thoughts
crept
in.
He
could
not
help
taking
note
of
the
two
squires:
handsome
boys,
fair
and
well
made.
One
was
Sansa’s
age,
with
long
golden
curls;
the
other
perhaps
fifteen,
sandy-haired,
with
a
wisp
of
a
mustache
and
the
emerald-green
eyes
of
the
queen.

“Ah,
I
wish
I
could
be
there
to
see
Santagar’s
face,”
Robert
said.
“I
hope
he’ll
have
the
wit
to
send
them
to
someone
else.
We
ought
to
keep
them
running
all
day!”

“Those
boys,”
Ned
asked
him.
“Lannisters?”

Robert
nodded,
wiping
tears
from
his
eyes.
“Cousins.
Sons
of
Lord
Tywin’s
brother.
One
of
the
dead
ones.
Or
perhaps
the
live
one,
now
that
I
come
to
think
on
it.
I
don’t
recall.
My
wife
comes
from
a
very
large
family,
Ned.”

A
very
ambitious
family,
Ned
thought.
He
had
nothing
against
the
squires,
but
it
troubled
him
to
see
Robert
surrounded
by
the
queen’s
kin,
waking
and
sleeping.
The
Lannister
appetite
for
offices
and
honors
seemed
to
know
no
bounds.
“The
talk
is
you
and
the
queen
had
angry
words
last
night.”

The
mirth
curdled
on
Robert’s
face.
“The
woman
tried
to
forbid
me
to
fight
in
the
melee.
She’s
sulking
in
the
castle
now,
damn
her.
Your
sister
would
never
have
shamed
me
like
that.”

“You
never
knew
Lyanna
as
I
did,
Robert,”
Ned
told
him.
“You
saw
her
beauty,
but
not
the
iron
underneath.
She
would
have
told
you
that
you
have
no
business
in
the
melee.”

“You
too?”
The
king
frowned.
“You
are
a
sour
man,
Stark.
Too
long
in
the
north,
all
the
juices
have
frozen
inside
you.
Well,
mine
are
still
running.”
He
slapped
his
chest
to
prove
it.

“You
are
the
king,”
Ned
reminded
him.

“I
sit
on
the
damn
iron
seat
when
I
must.
Does
that
mean
I
don’t
have
the
same
hungers
as
other
men?
A
bit
of
wine
now
and
again,
a
girl
squealing
in
bed,
the
feel
of
a
horse
between
my
legs?
Seven
hells,
Ned,
I
want
to
hit
someone.”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
spoke
up.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said,
“it
is
not
seemly
that
the
king
should
ride
into
the
melee.
It
would
not
be
a
fair
contest.
Who
would
dare
strike
you?”

Robert
seemed
honestly
taken
aback.
“Why,
all
of
them,
damn
it.
If
they
can.
And
the
last
man
left
standing…”

“…will
be
you,”
Ned
finished.
He
saw
at
once
that
Selmy
had
hit
the
mark.
The
dangers
of
the
melee
were
only
a
savor
to
Robert,
but
this
touched
on
his
pride.
“Ser
Barristan
is
right.
There’s
not
a
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
would
dare
risk
your
displeasure
by
hurting
you.”

The
king
rose
to
his
feet,
his
face
flushed.
“Are
you
telling
me
those
prancing
cravens
will
let
me
win?”

“For
a
certainty,”
Ned
said,
and
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
bowed
his
head
in
silent
accord.

For
a
moment
Robert
was
so
angry
he
could
not
speak.
He
strode
across
the
tent,
whirled,
strode
back,
his
face
dark
and
angry.
He
snatched
up
his
breastplate
from
the
ground
and
threw
it
at
Barristan
Selmy
in
a
wordless
fury.
Selmy
dodged.
“Get
out,”
the
king
said
then,
coldly.
“Get
out
before
I
kill
you.”

Ser
Barristan
left
quickly.
Ned
was
about
to
follow
when
the
king
called
out
again.
“Not
you,
Ned.”

Ned
turned
back.
Robert
took
up
his
horn
again,
filled
it
with
beer
from
a
barrel
in
the
corner,
and
thrust
it
at
Ned.
“Drink,”
he
said
brusquely.

“I’ve
no
thirst—”

“Drink.
Your
king
commands
it.”

Ned
took
the
horn
and
drank.
The
beer
was
black
and
thick,
so
strong
it
stung
the
eyes.

Robert
sat
down
again.
“Damn
you,
Ned
Stark.
You
and
Jon
Arryn,
I
loved
you
both.
What
have
you
done
to
me?
You
were
the
one
should
have
been
king,
you
or
Jon.”

“You
had
the
better
claim,
Your
Grace.”

“I
told
you
to
drink,
not
to
argue.
You
made
me
king,
you
could
at
least
have
the
courtesy
to
listen
when
I
talk,
damn
you.
Look
at
me,
Ned.
Look
at
what
kinging
has
done
to
me.
Gods,
too
fat
for
my
armor,
how
did
it
ever
come
to
this?”

“Robert…”

“Drink
and
stay
quiet,
the
king
is
talking.
I
swear
to
you,
I
was
never
so
alive
as
when
I
was
winning
this
throne,
or
so
dead
as
now
that
I’ve
won
it.
And
Cersei…
I
have
Jon
Arryn
to
thank
for
her.
I
had
no
wish
to
marry
after
Lyanna
was
taken
from
me,
but
Jon
said
the
realm
needed
an
heir.
Cersei
Lannister
would
be
a
good
match,
he
told
me,
she
would
bind
Lord
Tywin
to
me
should
Viserys
Targaryen
ever
try
to
win
back
his
father’s
throne.”
The
king
shook
his
head.
“I
loved
that
old
man,
I
swear
it,
but
now
I
think
he
was
a
bigger
fool
than
Moon
Boy.
Oh,
Cersei
is
lovely
to
look
at,
truly,
but
cold…
the
way
she
guards
her
cunt,
you’d
think
she
had
all
the
gold
of
Casterly
Rock
between
her
legs.
Here,
give
me
that
beer
if
you
won’t
drink
it.”
He
took
the
horn,
upended
it,
belched,
wiped
his
mouth.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
girl,
Ned.
Truly.
About
the
wolf,
I
mean.
My
son
was
lying,
I’d
stake
my
soul
on
it.
My
son…
you
love
your
children,
don’t
you?”

“With
all
my
heart,”
Ned
said.

“Let
me
tell
you
a
secret,
Ned.
More
than
once,
I
have
dreamed
of
giving
up
the
crown.
Take
ship
for
the
Free
Cities
with
my
horse
and
my
hammer,
spend
my
time
warring
and
whoring,
that’s
what
I
was
made
for.
The
sellsword
king,
how
the
singers
would
love
me.
You
know
what
stops
me?
The
thought
of
Joffrey
on
the
throne,
with
Cersei
standing
behind
him
whispering
in
his
ear.
My
son.
How
could
I
have
made
a
son
like
that,
Ned?”

“He’s
only
a
boy,”
Ned
said
awkwardly.
He
had
small
liking
for
Prince
Joffrey,
but
he
could
hear
the
pain
in
Robert’s
voice.
“Have
you
forgotten
how
wild
you
were
at
his
age?”

“It
would
not
trouble
me
if
the
boy
was
wild,
Ned.
You
don’t
know
him
as
I
do.”
He
sighed
and
shook
his
head.
“Ah,
perhaps
you
are
right.
Jon
despaired
of
me
often
enough,
yet
I
grew
into
a
good
king.”
Robert
looked
at
Ned
and
scowled
at
his
silence.
“You
might
speak
up
and
agree
now,
you
know.”

“Your
Grace…”
Ned
began,
carefully.

Robert
slapped
Ned
on
the
back.
“Ah,
say
that
I’m
a
better
king
than
Aerys
and
be
done
with
it.
You
never
could
lie
for
love
nor
honor,
Ned
Stark.
I’m
still
young,
and
now
that
you’re
here
with
me,
things
will
be
different.
We’ll
make
this
a
reign
to
sing
of,
and
damn
the
Lannisters
to
seven
hells.
I
smell
bacon.
Who
do
you
think
our
champion
will
be
today?
Have
you
seen
Mace
Tyrell’s
boy?
The
Knight
of
Flowers,
they
call
him.
Now
there’s
a
son
any
man
would
be
proud
to
own
to.
Last
tourney,
he
dumped
the
Kingslayer
on
his
golden
rump,
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
look
on
Cersei’s
face.
I
laughed
till
my
sides
hurt.
Renly
says
he
has
this
sister,
a
maid
of
fourteen,
lovely
as
a
dawn…”

They
broke
their
fast
on
black
bread
and
boiled
goose
eggs
and
fish
fried
up
with
onions
and
bacon,
at
a
trestle
table
by
the
river’s
edge.
The
king’s
melancholy
melted
away
with
the
morning
mist,
and
before
long
Robert
was
eating
an
orange
and
waxing
fond
about
a
morning
at
the
Eyrie
when
they
had
been
boys.
“…had
given
Jon
a
barrel
of
oranges,
remember?
Only
the
things
had
gone
rotten,
so
I
flung
mine
across
the
table
and
hit
Dacks
right
in
the
nose.
You
remember,
Redfort’s
pock-faced
squire?
He
tossed
one
back
at
me,
and
before
Jon
could
so
much
as
fart,
there
were
oranges
flying
across
the
High
Hall
in
every
direction.”
He
laughed
uproariously,
and
even
Ned
smiled,
remembering.

This
was
the
boy
he
had
grown
up
with,
he
thought;
this
was
the
Robert
Baratheon
he’d
known
and
loved.
If
he
could
prove
that
the
Lannisters
were
behind
the
attack
on
Bran,
prove
that
they
had
murdered
Jon
Arryn,
this
man
would
listen.
Then
Cersei
would
fall,
and
the
Kingslayer
with
her,
and
if
Lord
Tywin
dared
to
rouse
the
west,
Robert
would
smash
him
as
he
had
smashed
Rhaegar
Targaryen
on
the
Trident.
He
could
see
it
all
so
clearly.

That
breakfast
tasted
better
than
anything
Eddard
Stark
had
eaten
in
a
long
time,
and
afterward
his
smiles
came
easier
and
more
often,
until
it
was
time
for
the
tournament
to
resume.

Ned
walked
with
the
king
to
the
jousting
field.
He
had
promised
to
watch
the
final
tilts
with
Sansa;
Septa
Mordane
was
ill
today,
and
his
daughter
was
determined
not
to
miss
the
end
of
the
jousting.
As
he
saw
Robert
to
his
place,
he
noted
that
Cersei
Lannister
had
chosen
not
to
appear;
the
place
beside
the
king
was
empty.
That
too
gave
Ned
cause
to
hope.

He
shouldered
his
way
to
where
his
daughter
was
seated
and
found
her
as
the
horns
blew
for
the
day’s
first
joust.
Sansa
was
so
engrossed
she
scarcely
seemed
to
notice
his
arrival.

Sandor
Clegane
was
the
first
rider
to
appear.
He
wore
an
olive-green
cloak
over
his
soot-grey
armor.
That,
and
his
hound’s-head
helm,
were
his
only
concession
to
ornament.

“A
hundred
golden
dragons
on
the
Kingslayer,”
Littlefinger
announced
loudly
as
Jaime
Lannister
entered
the
lists,
riding
an
elegant
blood
bay
destrier.
The
horse
wore
a
blanket
of
gilded
ringmail,
and
Jaime
glittered
from
head
to
heel.
Even
his
lance
was
fashioned
from
the
golden
wood
of
the
Summer
Isles.

“Done,”
Lord
Renly
shouted
back.
“The
Hound
has
a
hungry
look
about
him
this
morning.”

“Even
hungry
dogs
know
better
than
to
bite
the
hand
that
feeds
them,”
Littlefinger
called
dryly.

Sandor
Clegane
dropped
his
visor
with
an
audible
clang
and
took
up
his
position.
Ser
Jaime
tossed
a
kiss
to
some
woman
in
the
commons,
gently
lowered
his
visor,
and
rode
to
the
end
of
the
lists.
Both
men
couched
their
lances.

Ned
Stark
would
have
loved
nothing
so
well
as
to
see
them
both
lose,
but
Sansa
was
watching
it
all
moist-eyed
and
eager.
The
hastily
erected
gallery
trembled
as
the
horses
broke
into
a
gallop.
The
Hound
leaned
forward
as
he
rode,
his
lance
rock
steady,
but
Jaime
shifted
his
seat
deftly
in
the
instant
before
impact.
Clegane’s
point
was
turned
harmlessly
against
the
golden
shield
with
the
lion
blazon,
while
his
own
hit
square.
Wood
shattered,
and
the
Hound
reeled,
fighting
to
keep
his
seat.
Sansa
gasped.
A
ragged
cheer
went
up
from
the
commons.

“I
wonder
how
I
ought
spend
your
money,”
Littlefinger
called
down
to
Lord
Renly.

The
Hound
just
managed
to
stay
in
his
saddle.
He
jerked
his
mount
around
hard
and
rode
back
to
the
lists
for
the
second
pass.
Jaime
Lannister
tossed
down
his
broken
lance
and
snatched
up
a
fresh
one,
jesting
with
his
squire.
The
Hound
spurred
forward
at
a
hard
gallop.
Lannister
rode
to
meet
him.
This
time,
when
Jaime
shifted
his
seat,
Sandor
Clegane
shifted
with
him.
Both
lances
exploded,
and
by
the
time
the
splinters
had
settled,
a
riderless
blood
bay
was
trotting
off
in
search
of
grass
while
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
rolled
in
the
dirt,
golden
and
dented.

Sansa
said,
“I
knew
the
Hound
would
win.”

Littlefinger
overheard.
“If
you
know
who’s
going
to
win
the
second
match,
speak
up
now
before
Lord
Renly
plucks
me
clean,”
he
called
to
her.
Ned
smiled.

“A
pity
the
Imp
is
not
here
with
us,”
Lord
Renly
said.
“I
should
have
won
twice
as
much.”

Jaime
Lannister
was
back
on
his
feet,
but
his
ornate
lion
helmet
had
been
twisted
around
and
dented
in
his
fall,
and
now
he
could
not
get
it
off.
The
commons
were
hooting
and
pointing,
the
lords
and
ladies
were
trying
to
stifle
their
chuckles,
and
failing,
and
over
it
all
Ned
could
hear
King
Robert
laughing,
louder
than
anyone.
Finally
they
had
to
lead
the
Lion
of
Lannister
off
to
a
blacksmith,
blind
and
stumbling.

By
then
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
was
in
position
at
the
head
of
the
lists.
He
was
huge,
the
biggest
man
that
Eddard
Stark
had
ever
seen.
Robert
Baratheon
and
his
brothers
were
all
big
men,
as
was
the
Hound,
and
back
at
Winterfell
there
was
a
simpleminded
stableboy
named
Hodor
who
dwarfed
them
all,
but
the
knight
they
called
the
Mountain
That
Rides
would
have
towered
over
Hodor.
He
was
well
over
seven
feet
tall,
closer
to
eight,
with
massive
shoulders
and
arms
thick
as
the
trunks
of
small
trees.
His
destrier
seemed
a
pony
in
between
his
armored
legs,
and
the
lance
he
carried
looked
as
small
as
a
broom
handle.

Unlike
his
brother,
Ser
Gregor
did
not
live
at
court.
He
was
a
solitary
man
who
seldom
left
his
own
lands,
but
for
wars
and
tourneys.
He
had
been
with
Lord
Tywin
when
King’s
Landing
fell,
a
new-made
knight
of
seventeen
years,
even
then
distinguished
by
his
size
and
his
implacable
ferocity.
Some
said
it
had
been
Gregor
who’d
dashed
the
skull
of
the
infant
prince
Aegon
Targaryen
against
a
wall,
and
whispered
that
afterward
he
had
raped
the
mother,
the
Dornish
princess
Elia,
before
putting
her
to
the
sword.
These
things
were
not
said
in
Gregor’s
hearing.

Ned
Stark
could
not
recall
ever
speaking
to
the
man,
though
Gregor
had
ridden
with
them
during
Balon
Greyjoy’s
rebellion,
one
knight
among
thousands.
He
watched
him
with
disquiet.
Ned
seldom
put
much
stock
in
gossip,
but
the
things
said
of
Ser
Gregor
were
more
than
ominous.
He
was
soon
to
be
married
for
the
third
time,
and
one
heard
dark
whisperings
about
the
deaths
of
his
first
two
wives.
It
was
said
that
his
keep
was
a
grim
place
where
servants
disappeared
unaccountably
and
even
the
dogs
were
afraid
to
enter
the
hall.
And
there
had
been
a
sister
who
had
died
young
under
queer
circumstances,
and
the
fire
that
had
disfigured
his
brother,
and
the
hunting
accident
that
had
killed
their
father.
Gregor
had
inherited
the
keep,
the
gold,
and
the
family
estates.
His
younger
brother
Sandor
had
left
the
same
day
to
take
service
with
the
Lannisters
as
a
sworn
sword,
and
it
was
said
that
he
had
never
returned,
not
even
to
visit.

When
the
Knight
of
Flowers
made
his
entrance,
a
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd,
and
he
heard
Sansa’s
fervent
whisper,
“Oh,
he’s
so
beautiful.”
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
was
slender
as
a
reed,
dressed
in
a
suit
of
fabulous
silver
armor
polished
to
a
blinding
sheen
and
filigreed
with
twining
black
vines
and
tiny
blue
forget-me-nots.
The
commons
realized
in
the
same
instant
as
Ned
that
the
blue
of
the
flowers
came
from
sapphires;
a
gasp
went
up
from
a
thousand
throats.
Across
the
boy’s
shoulders
his
cloak
hung
heavy.
It
was
woven
of
forget-me-nots,
real
ones,
hundreds
of
fresh
blooms
sewn
to
a
heavy
woolen
cape.

His
courser
was
as
slim
as
her
rider,
a
beautiful
grey
mare,
built
for
speed.
Ser
Gregor’s
huge
stallion
trumpeted
as
he
caught
her
scent.
The
boy
from
Highgarden
did
something
with
his
legs,
and
his
horse
pranced
sideways,
nimble
as
a
dancer.
Sansa
clutched
at
his
arm.
“Father,
don’t
let
Ser
Gregor
hurt
him,”
she
said.
Ned
saw
she
was
wearing
the
rose
that
Ser
Loras
had
given
her
yesterday.
Jory
had
told
him
about
that
as
well.

“These
are
tourney
lances,”
he
told
his
daughter.
“They
make
them
to
splinter
on
impact,
so
no
one
is
hurt.”
Yet
he
remembered
the
dead
boy
in
the
cart
with
his
cloak
of
crescent
moons,
and
the
words
were
raw
in
his
throat.

Ser
Gregor
was
having
trouble
controlling
his
horse.
The
stallion
was
screaming
and
pawing
the
ground,
shaking
his
head.
The
Mountain
kicked
at
the
animal
savagely
with
an
armored
boot.
The
horse
reared
and
almost
threw
him.

The
Knight
of
Flowers
saluted
the
king,
rode
to
the
far
end
of
the
list,
and
couched
his
lance,
ready.
Ser
Gregor
brought
his
animal
to
the
line,
fighting
with
the
reins.
And
suddenly
it
began.
The
Mountain’s
stallion
broke
in
a
hard
gallop,
plunging
forward
wildly,
while
the
mare
charged
as
smooth
as
a
flow
of
silk.
Ser
Gregor
wrenched
his
shield
into
position,
juggled
with
his
lance,
and
all
the
while
fought
to
hold
his
unruly
mount
on
a
straight
line,
and
suddenly
Loras
Tyrell
was
on
him,
placing
the
point
of
his
lance
just
there,
and
in
an
eye
blink
the
Mountain
was
failing.
He
was
so
huge
that
he
took
his
horse
down
with
him
in
a
tangle
of
steel
and
flesh.

Ned
heard
applause,
cheers,
whistles,
shocked
gasps,
excited
muttering,
and
over
it
all
the
rasping,
raucous
laughter
of
the
Hound.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
reined
up
at
the
end
of
the
lists.
His
lance
was
not
even
broken.
His
sapphires
winked
in
the
sun
as
he
raised
his
visor,
smiling.
The
commons
went
mad
for
him.

In
the
middle
of
the
field,
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
disentangled
himself
and
came
boiling
to
his
feet.
He
wrenched
off
his
helm
and
slammed
it
down
onto
the
ground.
His
face
was
dark
with
fury
and
his
hair
fell
down
into
his
eyes.
“My
sword,”
he
shouted
to
his
squire,
and
the
boy
ran
it
out
to
him.
By
then
his
stallion
was
back
on
its
feet
as
well.

Gregor
Clegane
killed
the
horse
with
a
single
blow
of
such
ferocity
that
it
half
severed
the
animal’s
neck.
Cheers
turned
to
shrieks
in
a
heartbeat.
The
stallion
went
to
its
knees,
screaming
as
it
died.
By
then
Gregor
was
striding
down
the
lists
toward
Ser
Loras
Tyrell,
his
bloody
sword
clutched
in
his
fist.
“Stop
him!”
Ned
shouted,
but
his
words
were
lost
in
the
roar.
Everyone
else
was
yelling
as
well,
and
Sansa
was
crying.

It
all
happened
so
fast.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
was
shouting
for
his
own
sword
as
Ser
Gregor
knocked
his
squire
aside
and
made
a
grab
for
the
reins
of
his
horse.
The
mare
scented
blood
and
reared.
Loras
Tyrell
kept
his
seat,
but
barely.
Ser
Gregor
swung
his
sword,
a
savage
two-handed
blow
that
took
the
boy
in
the
chest
and
knocked
him
from
the
saddle.
The
courser
dashed
away
in
panic
as
Ser
Loras
lay
stunned
in
the
dirt.
But
as
Gregor
lifted
his
sword
for
the
killing
blow,
a
rasping
voice
warned,
“Leave
him
be,”
and
a
steel-clad
hand
wrenched
him
away
from
the
boy.

The
Mountain
pivoted
in
wordless
fury,
swinging
his
longsword
in
a
killing
arc
with
all
his
massive
strength
behind
it,
but
the
Hound
caught
the
blow
and
turned
it,
and
for
what
seemed
an
eternity
the
two
brothers
stood
hammering
at
each
other
as
a
dazed
Loras
Tyrell
was
helped
to
safety.
Thrice
Ned
saw
Ser
Gregor
aim
savage
blows
at
the
hound’s-head
helmet,
yet
not
once
did
Sandor
send
a
cut
at
his
brother’s
unprotected
face.

It
was
the
king’s
voice
that
put
an
end
to
it…
the
king’s
voice
and
twenty
swords.
Jon
Arryn
had
told
them
that
a
commander
needs
a
good
battlefield
voice,
and
Robert
had
proved
the
truth
of
that
on
the
Trident.
He
used
that
voice
now.
“STOP
THIS
MADNESS,”
he
boomed,
“IN
THE
NAME
OF
YOUR
KING!”

The
Hound
went
to
one
knee.
Ser
Gregor’s
blow
cut
air,
and
at
last
he
came
to
his
senses.
He
dropped
his
sword
and
glared
at
Robert,
surrounded
by
his
Kingsguard
and
a
dozen
other
knights
and
guardsmen.
Wordlessly,
he
turned
and
strode
off,
shoving
past
Barristan
Selmy.
“Let
him
go,”
Robert
said,
and
as
quickly
as
that,
it
was
over.

“Is
the
Hound
the
champion
now?”
Sansa
asked
Ned.

“No,”
he
told
her.
“There
will
be
one
final
joust,
between
the
Hound
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers.”

But
Sansa
had
the
right
of
it
after
all.
A
few
moments
later
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
walked
back
onto
the
field
in
a
simple
linen
doublet
and
said
to
Sandor
Clegane,
“I
owe
you
my
life.
The
day
is
yours,
ser.”

“I
am
no
ser,”
the
Hound
replied,
but
he
took
the
victory,
and
the
champion’s
purse,
and,
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life,
the
love
of
the
commons.
They
cheered
him
as
he
left
the
lists
to
return
to
his
pavilion.

As
Ned
walked
with
Sansa
to
the
archery
field,
Littlefinger
and
Lord
Renly
and
some
of
the
others
fell
in
with
them.
“Tyrell
had
to
know
the
mare
was
in
heat,”
Littlefinger
was
saying.
“I
swear
the
boy
planned
the
whole
thing.
Gregor
has
always
favored
huge,
ill-tempered
stallions
with
more
spirit
than
sense.”
The
notion
seemed
to
amuse
him.

It
did
not
amuse
Ser
Barristan
Selmy.
“There
is
small
honor
in
tricks,”
the
old
man
said
stiffly.

“Small
honor
and
twenty
thousand
golds.”
Lord
Renly
smiled.

That
afternoon
a
boy
named
Anguy,
an
unheralded
commoner
from
the
Dornish
Marches,
won
the
archery
competition,
outshooting
Ser
Balon
Swann
and
Jalabhar
Xho
at
a
hundred
paces
after
all
the
other
bowmen
had
been
eliminated
at
the
shorter
distances.
Ned
sent
Alyn
to
seek
him
out
and
offer
him
a
position
with
the
Hand’s
guard,
but
the
boy
was
flush
with
wine
and
victory
and
riches
undreamed
of,
and
he
refused.

The
melee
went
on
for
three
hours.
Near
forty
men
took
part,
freeriders
and
hedge
knights
and
new-made
squires
in
search
of
a
reputation.
They
fought
with
blunted
weapons
in
a
chaos
of
mud
and
blood,
small
troops
fighting
together
and
then
turning
on
each
other
as
alliances
formed
and
fractured,
until
only
one
man
was
left
standing.
The
victor
was
the
red
priest,
Thoros
of
Myr,
a
madman
who
shaved
his
head
and
fought
with
a
flaming
sword.
He
had
won
melees
before;
the
fire
sword
frightened
the
mounts
of
the
other
riders,
and
nothing
frightened
Thoros.
The
final
tally
was
three
broken
limbs,
a
shattered
collarbone,
a
dozen
smashed
fingers,
two
horses
that
had
to
be
put
down,
and
more
cuts,
sprains,
and
bruises
than
anyone
cared
to
count.
Ned
was
desperately
pleased
that
Robert
had
not
taken
part.

That
night
at
the
feast,
Eddard
Stark
was
more
hopeful
than
he
had
been
in
a
great
while.
Robert
was
in
high
good
humor,
the
Lannisters
were
nowhere
to
be
seen,
and
even
his
daughters
were
behaving.
Jory
brought
Arya
down
to
join
them,
and
Sansa
spoke
to
her
sister
pleasantly.
“The
tournament
was
magnificent,”
she
sighed.
“You
should
have
come.
How
was
your
dancing?”

“I’m
sore
all
over,”
Arya
reported
happily,
proudly
displaying
a
huge
purple
bruise
on
her
leg.

“You
must
be
a
terrible
dancer,”
Sansa
said
doubtfully.

Later,
while
Sansa
was
off
listening
to
a
troupe
of
singers
perform
the
complex
round
of
interwoven
ballads
called
the
“Dance
of
the
Dragons,”
Ned
inspected
the
bruise
himself.
“I
hope
Forel
is
not
being
too
hard
on
you,”
he
said.

Arya
stood
on
one
leg.
She
was
getting
much
better
at
that
of
late.
“Syrio
says
that
every
hurt
is
a
lesson,
and
every
lesson
makes
you
better.”

Ned
frowned.
The
man
Syrio
Forel
had
come
with
an
excellent
reputation,
and
his
flamboyant
Braavosi
style
was
well
suited
to
Arya’s
slender
blade,
yet
still…
a
few
days
ago,
she
had
been
wandering
around
with
a
swatch
of
black
silk
tied
over
her
eyes.
Syrio
was
teaching
her
to
see
with
her
ears
and
her
nose
and
her
skin,
she
told
him.
Before
that,
he
had
her
doing
spins
and
back
flips.
“Arya,
are
you
certain
you
want
to
persist
in
this?”

She
nodded.
“Tomorrow
we’re
going
to
catch
cats.”

“Cats.”
Ned
sighed.
“Perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
to
hire
this
Braavosi.
If
you
like,
I
will
ask
Jory
to
take
over
your
lessons.
Or
I
might
have
a
quiet
word
with
Ser
Barristan.
He
was
the
finest
sword
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
in
his
youth.”

“I
don’t
want
them,”
Arya
said.
“I
want
Syrio.”

Ned
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair.
Any
decent
master-at-arms
could
give
Arya
the
rudiments
of
slash-and-parry
without
this
nonsense
of
blindfolds,
cartwheels,
and
hopping
about
on
one
leg,
but
he
knew
his
youngest
daughter
well
enough
to
know
there
was
no
arguing
with
that
stubborn
jut
of
jaw.
“As
you
wish,”
he
said.
Surely
she
would
grow
tired
of
this
soon.
“Try
to
be
careful.”

“I
will,”
she
promised
solemnly
as
she
hopped
smoothly
from
her
right
leg
to
her
left.

Much
later,
after
he
had
taken
the
girls
back
through
the
city
and
seen
them
both
safe
in
bed,
Sansa
with
her
dreams
and
Arya
with
her
bruises,
Ned
ascended
to
his
own
chambers
atop
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
The
day
had
been
warm
and
the
room
was
close
and
stuffy.
Ned
went
to
the
window
and
unfastened
the
heavy
shutters
to
let
in
the
cool
night
air.
Across
the
Great
Yard,
he
noticed
the
flickering
glow
of
candlelight
from
Littlefinger’s
windows.
The
hour
was
well
past
midnight.
Down
by
the
river,
the
revels
were
only
now
beginning
to
dwindle
and
die.

He
took
out
the
dagger
and
studied
it.
Littlefinger’s
blade,
won
by
Tyrion
Lannister
in
a
tourney
wager,
sent
to
slay
Bran
in
his
sleep.
Why?
Why
would
the
dwarf
want
Bran
dead?
Why
would
anyone
want
Bran
dead?

The
dagger,
Bran’s
fall,
all
of
it
was
linked
somehow
to
the
murder
of
Jon
Arryn,
he
could
feel
it
in
his
gut,
but
the
truth
of
Jon’s
death
remained
as
clouded
to
him
as
when
he
had
started.
Lord
Stannis
had
not
returned
to
King’s
Landing
for
the
tourney.
Lysa
Arryn
held
her
silence
behind
the
high
walls
of
the
Eyrie.
The
squire
was
dead,
and
Jory
was
still
searching
the
whorehouses.
What
did
he
have
but
Robert’s
bastard?

That
the
armorer’s
sullen
apprentice
was
the
king’s
son,
Ned
had
no
doubt.
The
Baratheon
look
was
stamped
on
his
face,
in
his
jaw,
his
eyes,
that
black
hair.
Renly
was
too
young
to
have
fathered
a
boy
of
that
age,
Stannis
too
cold
and
proud
in
his
honor.
Gendry
had
to
be
Robert’s.

Yet
knowing
all
that,
what
had
he
learned?
The
king
had
other
baseborn
children
scattered
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
He
had
openly
acknowledged
one
of
his
bastards,
a
boy
of
Bran’s
age
whose
mother
was
highborn.
The
lad
was
being
fostered
by
Lord
Renly’s
castellan
at
Storm’s
End.

Ned
remembered
Robert’s
first
child
as
well,
a
daughter
born
in
the
Vale
when
Robert
was
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
himself.
A
sweet
little
girl;
the
young
lord
of
Storm’s
End
had
doted
on
her.
He
used
to
make
daily
visits
to
play
with
the
babe,
long
after
he
had
lost
interest
in
the
mother.
Ned
was
often
dragged
along
for
company,
whether
he
willed
it
or
not.
The
girl
would
be
seventeen
or
eighteen
now,
he
realized;
older
than
Robert
had
been
when
he
fathered
her.
A
strange
thought.

Cersei
could
not
have
been
pleased
by
her
lord
husband’s
by-blows,
yet
in
the
end
it
mattered
little
whether
the
king
had
one
bastard
or
a
hundred.
Law
and
custom
gave
the
baseborn
few
rights.
Gendry,
the
girl
in
the
Vale,
the
boy
at
Storm’s
End,
none
of
them
could
threaten
Robert’s
trueborn
children…

His
musings
were
ended
by
a
soft
rap
on
his
door.
“A
man
to
see
you,
my
lord,”
Harwin
called.
“He
will
not
give
his
name.”

“Send
him
in,”
Ned
said,
wondering.

The
visitor
was
a
stout
man
in
cracked,
mud-caked
boots
and
a
heavy
brown
robe
of
the
coarsest
roughspun,
his
features
hidden
by
a
cowl,
his
hands
drawn
up
into
voluminous
sleeves.

“Who
are
you?”
Ned
asked.

“A
friend,”
the
cowled
man
said
in
a
strange,
low
voice.
“We
must
speak
alone,
Lord
Stark.”

Curiosity
was
stronger
than
caution.
“Harwin,
leave
us,”
he
commanded.
Not
until
they
were
alone
behind
closed
doors
did
his
visitor
draw
back
his
cowl.

“Lord
Varys?”
Ned
said
in
astonishment.

“Lord
Stark,”
Varys
said
politely,
seating
himself.
“I
wonder
if
I
might
trouble
you
for
a
drink?”

Ned
filled
two
cups
with
summerwine
and
handed
one
to
Varys.
“I
might
have
passed
within
a
foot
of
you
and
never
recognized
you,”
he
said,
incredulous.
He
had
never
seen
the
eunuch
dress
in
anything
but
silk
and
velvet
and
the
richest
damasks,
and
this
man
smelled
of
sweat
instead
of
lilacs.

“That
was
my
dearest
hope,”
Varys
said.
“It
would
not
do
if
certain
people
learned
that
we
had
spoken
in
private.
The
queen
watches
you
closely.
This
wine
is
very
choice.
Thank
you.”

“How
did
you
get
past
my
other
guards?”
Ned
asked.
Porther
and
Cayn
had
been
posted
outside
the
tower,
and
Alyn
on
the
stairs.

“The
Red
Keep
has
ways
known
only
to
ghosts
and
spiders.”
Varys
smiled
apologetically.
“I
will
not
keep
you
long,
my
lord.
There
are
things
you
must
know.
You
are
the
King’s
Hand,
and
the
king
is
a
fool.”
The
eunuch’s
cloying
tones
were
gone;
now
his
voice
was
thin
and
sharp
as
a
whip.
“Your
friend,
I
know,
yet
a
fool
nonetheless…
and
doomed,
unless
you
save
him.
Today
was
a
near
thing.
They
had
hoped
to
kill
him
during
the
melee.”

For
a
moment
Ned
was
speechless
with
shock.
“Who?”

Varys
sipped
his
wine.
“If
I
truly
need
to
tell
you
that,
you
are
a
bigger
fool
than
Robert
and
I
am
on
the
wrong
side.”

“The
Lannisters,”
Ned
said.
“The
queen…
no,
I
will
not
believe
that,
not
even
of
Cersei.
She
asked
him
not
to
fight!”

“She
forbade
him
to
fight,
in
front
of
his
brother,
his
knights,
and
half
the
court.
Tell
me
truly,
do
you
know
any
surer
way
to
force
King
Robert
into
the
melee?
I
ask
you.”

Ned
had
a
sick
feeling
in
his
gut.
The
eunuch
had
hit
upon
a
truth;
tell
Robert
Baratheon
he
could
not,
should
not,
or
must
not
do
a
thing,
and
it
was
as
good
as
done.
“Even
if
he’d
fought,
who
would
have
dared
to
strike
the
king?”

Varys
shrugged.
“There
were
forty
riders
in
the
melee.
The
Lannisters
have
many
friends.
Amidst
all
that
chaos,
with
horses
screaming
and
bones
breaking
and
Thoros
of
Myr
waving
that
absurd
firesword
of
his,
who
could
name
it
murder
if
some
chance
blow
felled
His
Grace?”
He
went
to
the
flagon
and
refilled
his
cup.
“After
the
deed
was
done,
the
slayer
would
be
beside
himself
with
grief.
I
can
almost
hear
him
weeping.
So
sad.
Yet
no
doubt
the
gracious
and
compassionate
widow
would
take
pity,
lift
the
poor
unfortunate
to
his
feet,
and
bless
him
with
a
gentle
kiss
of
forgiveness.
Good
King
Joffrey
would
have
no
choice
but
to
pardon
him.”
The
eunuch
stroked
his
cheek.
“Or
perhaps
Cersei
would
let
Ser
Ilyn
strike
off
his
head.
Less
risk
for
the
Lannisters
that
way,
though
quite
an
unpleasant
surprise
for
their
little
friend.”

Ned
felt
his
anger
rise.
“You
knew
of
this
plot,
and
yet
you
did
nothing.”

“I
command
whisperers,
not
warriors.”

“You
might
have
come
to
me
earlier.”

“Oh,
yes,
I
confess
it.
And
you
would
have
rushed
straight
to
the
king,
yes?
And
when
Robert
heard
of
his
peril,
what
would
he
have
done?
I
wonder.”

Ned
considered
that.
“He
would
have
damned
them
all,
and
fought
anyway,
to
show
he
did
not
fear
them.”

Varys
spread
his
hands.
“I
will
make
another
confession,
Lord
Eddard.
I
was
curious
to
see
what
you
would
do.
Why
not
come
to
me?
you
ask,
and
I
must
answer,
Why,
because
I
did
not
trust
you,
my
lord.”

“You
did
not
trust
me?”
Ned
was
frankly
astonished.

“The
Red
Keep
shelters
two
sorts
of
people,
Lord
Eddard,”
Varys
said.
“Those
who
are
loyal
to
the
realm,
and
those
who
are
loyal
only
to
themselves.
Until
this
morning,
I
could
not
say
which
you
might
be…
so
I
waited
to
see…
and
now
I
know,
for
a
certainty.”
He
smiled
a
plump
tight
little
smile,
and
for
a
moment
his
private
face
and
public
mask
were
one.
“I
begin
to
comprehend
why
the
queen
fears
you
so
much.
Oh,
yes
I
do.”

“You
are
the
one
she
ought
to
fear,”
Ned
said.

“No.
I
am
what
I
am.
The
king
makes
use
of
me,
but
it
shames
him.
A
most
puissant
warrior
is
our
Robert,
and
such
a
manly
man
has
little
love
for
sneaks
and
spies
and
eunuchs.
If
a
day
should
come
when
Cersei
whispers,
‘Kill
that
man,’
Ilyn
Payne
will
snick
my
head
off
in
a
twinkling,
and
who
will
mourn
poor
Varys
then?
North
or
south,
they
sing
no
songs
for
spiders.”
He
reached
out
and
touched
Ned
with
a
soft
hand.
“But
you,
Lord
Stark…
I
think…
no,
I
know…
he
would
not
kill
you,
not
even
for
his
queen,
and
there
may
lie
our
salvation.”

It
was
all
too
much.
For
a
moment
Eddard
Stark
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
return
to
Winterfell,
to
the
clean
simplicity
of
the
north,
where
the
enemies
were
winter
and
the
wildlings
beyond
the
Wall.
“Surely
Robert
has
other
loyal
friends,”
he
protested.
“His
brothers,
his—”

“—wife?”
Varys
finished,
with
a
smile
that
cut.
“His
brothers
hate
the
Lannisters,
true
enough,
but
hating
the
queen
and
loving
the
king
are
not
quite
the
same
thing,
are
they?
Ser
Barristan
loves
his
honor,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
loves
his
office,
and
Littlefinger
loves
Littlefinger.”

“The
Kingsguard—”

“A
paper
shield,”
the
eunuch
said.
“Try
not
to
look
so
shocked,
Lord
Stark.
Jaime
Lannister
is
himself
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
White
Swords,
and
we
all
know
what
his
oath
is
worth.
The
days
when
men
like
Ryam
Redwyne
and
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
wore
the
white
cloak
are
gone
to
dust
and
song.
Of
these
seven,
only
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
is
made
of
the
true
steel,
and
Selmy
is
old.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
are
the
queen’s
creatures
to
the
bone,
and
I
have
deep
suspicions
of
the
others.
No,
my
lord,
when
the
swords
come
out
in
earnest,
you
will
be
the
only
true
friend
Robert
Baratheon
will
have.”

“Robert
must
be
told,”
Ned
said.
“If
what
you
say
is
true,
if
even
a
part
of
it
is
true,
the
king
must
hear
it
for
himself.”

“And
what
proof
shall
we
lay
before
him?
My
words
against
theirs?
My
little
birds
against
the
queen
and
the
Kingslayer,
against
his
brothers
and
his
council,
against
the
Wardens
of
East
and
West,
against
all
the
might
of
Casterly
Rock?
Pray,
send
for
Ser
Ilyn
directly,
it
will
save
us
all
some
time.
I
know
where
that
road
ends.”

“Yet
if
what
you
say
is
true,
they
will
only
bide
their
time
and
make
another
attempt.”

“Indeed
they
will,”
said
Varys,
“and
sooner
rather
than
later,
I
do
fear.
You
are
making
them
most
anxious,
Lord
Eddard.
But
my
little
birds
will
be
listening,
and
together
we
may
be
able
to
forestall
them,
you
and
I.”
He
rose
and
pulled
up
his
cowl
so
his
face
was
hidden
once
more.
“Thank
you
for
the
wine.
We
will
speak
again.
When
you
see
me
next
at
council,
be
certain
to
treat
me
with
your
accustomed
contempt.
You
should
not
find
it
difficult.”

He
was
at
the
door
when
Ned
called,
“Varys.”
The
eunuch
turned
back.
“How
did
Jon
Arryn
die?”

“I
wondered
when
you
would
get
around
to
that.”

“Tell
me.”

“The
tears
of
Lys,
they
call
it.
A
rare
and
costly
thing,
clear
and
sweet
as
water,
and
it
leaves
no
trace.
I
begged
Lord
Arryn
to
use
a
taster,
in
this
very
room
I
begged
him,
but
he
would
not
hear
of
it.
Only
one
who
was
less
than
a
man
would
even
think
of
such
a
thing,
he
told
me.”

Ned
had
to
know
the
rest.
“Who
gave
him
the
poison?”

“Some
dear
sweet
friend
who
often
shared
meat
and
mead
with
him,
no
doubt.
Oh,
but
which
one?
There
were
many
such.
Lord
Arryn
was
a
kindly,
trusting
man.”
The
eunuch
sighed.
“There
was
one
boy.
All
he
was,
he
owed
Jon
Arryn,
but
when
the
widow
fled
to
the
Eyrie
with
her
household,
he
stayed
in
King’s
Landing
and
prospered.
It
always
gladdens
my
heart
to
see
the
young
rise
in
the
world.”
The
whip
was
in
his
voice
again,
every
word
a
stroke.
“He
must
have
cut
a
gallant
figure
in
the
tourney,
him
in
his
bright
new
armor,
with
those
crescent
moons
on
his
cloak.
A
pity
he
died
so
untimely,
before
you
could
talk
to
him…”

Ned
felt
half-poisoned
himself.
“The
squire,”
he
said.
“Ser
Hugh.”
Wheels
within
wheels
within
wheels.
Ned’s
head
was
pounding.
“Why?
Why
now?
Jon
Arryn
had
been
Hand
for
fourteen
years.
What
was
he
doing
that
they
had
to
kill
him?”

“Asking
questions,”
Varys
said,
slipping
out
the
door.





TYRION

As
he
stood
in
the
predawn
chill
watching
Chiggen
butcher
his
horse,
Tyrion
Lannister
chalked
up
one
more
debt
owed
the
Starks.
Steam
rose
from
inside
the
carcass
when
the
squat
sellsword
opened
the
belly
with
his
skinning
knife.
His
hands
moved
deftly,
with
never
a
wasted
cut;
the
work
had
to
be
done
quickly,
before
the
stink
of
blood
brought
shadowcats
down
from
the
heights.

“None
of
us
will
go
hungry
tonight,”
Bronn
said.
He
was
near
a
shadow
himself;
bone
thin
and
bone
hard,
with
black
eyes
and
black
hair
and
a
stubble
of
beard.

“Some
of
us
may,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“I
am
not
fond
of
eating
horse.
Particularly
my
horse.”

“Meat
is
meat,”
Bronn
said
with
a
shrug.
“The
Dothraki
like
horse
more
than
beef
or
pork.”

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
Dothraki?”
Tyrion
asked
sourly.
The
Dothraki
ate
horse,
in
truth;
they
also
left
deformed
children
out
for
the
feral
dogs
who
ran
behind
their
khalasars.
Dothraki
customs
had
scant
appeal
for
him.

Chiggen
sliced
a
thin
strip
of
bloody
meat
off
the
carcass
and
held
it
up
for
inspection.
“Want
a
taste,
dwarf?”

“My
brother
Jaime
gave
me
that
mare
for
my
twenty-third
name
day,”
Tyrion
said
in
a
flat
voice.

“Thank
him
for
us,
then.
If
you
ever
see
him
again.”
Chiggen
grinned,
showing
yellow
teeth,
and
swallowed
the
raw
meat
in
two
bites.
“Tastes
well
bred.”

“Better
if
you
fry
it
up
with
onions,”
Bronn
put
in.

Wordlessly,
Tyrion
limped
away.
The
cold
had
settled
deep
in
his
bones,
and
his
legs
were
so
sore
he
could
scarcely
walk.
Perhaps
his
dead
mare
was
the
lucky
one.
He
had
hours
more
riding
ahead
of
him,
followed
by
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
and
a
short,
cold
sleep
on
hard
ground,
and
then
another
night
of
the
same,
and
another,
and
another,
and
the
gods
only
knew
how
it
would
end.
“Damn
her,”
he
muttered
as
he
struggled
up
the
road
to
rejoin
his
captors,
remembering,
“damn
her
and
all
the
Starks.”

The
memory
was
still
bitter.
One
moment
he’d
been
ordering
supper,
and
an
eye
blink
later
he
was
facing
a
room
of
armed
men,
with
Jyck
reaching
for
a
sword
and
the
fat
innkeep
shrieking,
“No
swords,
not
here,
please,
m’lords.”

Tyrion
wrenched
down
Jyck’s
arm
hurriedly,
before
he
got
them
both
hacked
to
pieces.
“Where
are
your
courtesies,
Jyck?
Our
good
hostess
said
no
swords.
Do
as
she
asks.”
He
forced
a
smile
that
must
have
looked
as
queasy
as
it
felt.
“You’re
making
a
sad
mistake,
Lady
Stark.
I
had
no
part
in
any
attack
on
your
son.
On
my
honor—”

“Lannister
honor,”
was
all
she
said.
She
held
up
her
hands
for
all
the
room
to
see.
“His
dagger
left
these
scars.
The
blade
he
sent
to
open
my
son’s
throat.”

Tyrion
felt
the
anger
all
around
him,
thick
and
smoky,
fed
by
the
deep
cuts
in
the
Stark
woman’s
hands.
“Kill
him,”
hissed
some
drunken
slattern
from
the
back,
and
other
voices
took
up
the
call,
faster
than
he
would
have
believed.
Strangers
all,
friendly
enough
only
a
moment
ago,
and
yet
now
they
cried
for
his
blood
like
hounds
on
a
trail.

Tyrion
spoke
up
loudly,
trying
to
keep
the
quaver
from
his
voice.
“If
Lady
Stark
believes
I
have
some
crime
to
answer
for,
I
will
go
with
her
and
answer
for
it.”

It
was
the
only
possible
course.
Trying
to
cut
their
way
out
of
this
was
a
sure
invitation
to
an
early
grave.
A
good
dozen
swords
had
responded
to
the
Stark
woman’s
plea
for
help:
the
Harrenhal
man,
the
three
Brackens,
a
pair
of
unsavory
sellswords
who
looked
as
though
they’d
kill
him
as
soon
as
spit,
and
some
fool
field
hands
who
doubtless
had
no
idea
what
they
were
doing.
Against
that,
what
did
Tyrion
have?
A
dagger
at
his
belt,
and
two
men.
Jyck
swung
a
fair
enough
sword,
but
Morrec
scarcely
counted;
he
was
part
groom,
part
cook,
part
body
servant,
and
no
soldier.
As
for
Yoren,
whatever
his
feelings
might
have
been,
the
black
brothers
were
sworn
to
take
no
part
in
the
quarrels
of
the
realm.
Yoren
would
do
nothing.

And
indeed,
the
black
brother
stepped
aside
silently
when
the
old
knight
by
Catelyn
Stark’s
side
said,
“Take
their
weapons,”
and
the
sellsword
Bronn
stepped
forward
to
pull
the
sword
from
Jyck’s
fingers
and
relieve
them
all
of
their
daggers.
“Good,”
the
old
man
said
as
the
tension
in
the
common
room
ebbed
palpably,
“excellent.”
Tyrion
recognized
the
gruff
voice;
Winterfell’s
master-at-arms,
shorn
of
his
whiskers.

Scarlet-tinged
spittle
flew
from
the
fat
innkeep’s
mouth
as
she
begged
of
Catelyn
Stark,
“Don’t
kill
him
here!”

“Don’t
kill
him
anywhere,”
Tyrion
urged.

“Take
him
somewheres
else,
no
blood
here,
m’lady,
I
wants
no
high
lordlin’s
quarrels.”

“We
are
taking
him
back
to
Winterfell,”
she
said,
and
Tyrion
thought,
Well,
perhaps…
By
then
he’d
had
a
moment
to
glance
over
the
room
and
get
a
better
idea
of
the
situation.
He
was
not
altogether
displeased
by
what
he
saw.
Oh,
the
Stark
woman
had
been
clever,
no
doubt
of
it.
Force
them
to
make
a
public
affirmation
of
the
oaths
sworn
her
father
by
the
lords
they
served,
and
then
call
on
them
for
succor,
and
her
a
woman,
yes,
that
was
sweet.
Yet
her
success
was
not
as
complete
as
she
might
have
liked.
There
were
close
to
fifty
in
the
common
room
by
his
rough
count.
Catelyn
Stark’s
plea
had
roused
a
bare
dozen;
the
others
looked
confused,
or
frightened,
or
sullen.
Only
two
of
the
Freys
had
stirred,
Tyrion
noted,
and
they’d
sat
back
down
quick
enough
when
their
captain
failed
to
move.
He
might
have
smiled
if
he’d
dared.

“Winterfell
it
is,
then,”
he
said
instead.
That
was
a
long
ride,
as
he
could
well
attest,
having
just
ridden
it
the
other
way.
So
many
things
could
happen
along
the
way.
“My
father
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
me,”
he
added,
catching
the
eye
of
the
swordsman
who’d
offered
to
yield
up
his
room.
“He’ll
pay
a
handsome
reward
to
any
man
who
brings
him
word
of
what
happened
here
today.”
Lord
Tywin
would
do
no
such
thing,
of
course,
but
Tyrion
would
make
up
for
it
if
he
won
free.

Ser
Rodrik
glanced
at
his
lady,
his
look
worried,
as
well
it
might
be.
“His
men
come
with
him,”
the
old
knight
announced.
“And
we’ll
thank
the
rest
of
you
to
stay
quiet
about
what
you’ve
seen
here.”

It
was
all
Tyrion
could
do
not
to
laugh.
Quiet?
The
old
fool.
Unless
he
took
the
whole
inn,
the
word
would
begin
to
spread
the
instant
they
were
gone.
The
freerider
with
the
gold
coin
in
his
pocket
would
fly
to
Casterly
Rock
like
an
arrow.
If
not
him,
then
someone
else.
Yoren
would
carry
the
story
south.
That
fool
singer
might
make
a
lay
of
it.
The
Freys
would
report
back
to
their
lord,
and
the
gods
only
knew
what
he
might
do.
Lord
Walder
Frey
might
be
sworn
to
Riverrun,
but
he
was
a
cautious
man
who
had
lived
a
long
time
by
making
certain
he
was
always
on
the
winning
side.
At
the
very
least
he
would
send
his
birds
winging
south
to
King’s
Landing,
and
he
might
well
dare
more
than
that.

Catelyn
Stark
wasted
no
time.
“We
must
ride
at
once.
We’ll
want
fresh
mounts,
and
provisions
for
the
road.
You
men,
know
that
you
have
the
eternal
gratitude
of
House
Stark.
If
any
of
you
choose
to
help
us
guard
our
captives
and
get
them
safe
to
Winterfell,
I
promise
you
shall
be
well
rewarded.”
That
was
all
it
took;
the
fools
came
rushing
forward.
Tyrion
studied
their
faces;
they
would
indeed
be
well
rewarded,
he
vowed
to
himself,
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
they
imagined.

Yet
even
as
they
were
bundling
him
outside,
saddling
the
horses
in
the
rain,
and
tying
his
hands
with
a
length
of
coarse
rope,
Tyrion
Lannister
was
not
truly
afraid.
They
would
never
get
him
to
Winterfell,
he
would
have
given
odds
on
that.
Riders
would
be
after
them
within
the
day,
birds
would
take
wing,
and
surely
one
of
the
river
lords
would
want
to
curry
favor
with
his
father
enough
to
take
a
hand.
Tyrion
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
subtlety
when
someone
pulled
a
hood
down
over
his
eyes
and
lifted
him
up
onto
a
saddle.

They
set
out
through
the
rain
at
a
hard
gallop,
and
before
long
Tyrion’s
thighs
were
cramped
and
aching
and
his
butt
throbbed
with
pain.
Even
when
they
were
safely
away
from
the
inn,
and
Catelyn
Stark
slowed
them
to
a
trot,
it
was
a
miserable
pounding
journey
over
rough
ground,
made
worse
by
his
blindness.
Every
twist
and
turn
put
him
in
danger
of
falling
off
his
horse.
The
hood
muffled
sound,
so
he
could
not
make
out
what
was
being
said
around
him,
and
the
rain
soaked
through
the
cloth
and
made
it
cling
to
his
face,
until
even
breathing
was
a
struggle.
The
rope
chafed
his
wrists
raw
and
seemed
to
grow
tighter
as
the
night
wore
on.
I
was
about
to
settle
down
to
a
warm
fire
and
a
roast
fowl,
and
that
wretched
singer
had
to
open
his
mouth,
he
thought
mournfully.
The
wretched
singer
had
come
along
with
them.
“There
is
a
great
song
to
be
made
from
this,
and
I’m
the
one
to
make
it,”
he
told
Catelyn
Stark
when
he
announced
his
intention
of
riding
with
them
to
see
how
the
“splendid
adventure”
turned
out.
Tyrion
wondered
whether
the
boy
would
think
the
adventure
quite
so
splendid
once
the
Lannister
riders
caught
up
with
them.

The
rain
had
finally
stopped
and
dawn
light
was
seeping
through
the
wet
cloth
over
his
eyes
when
Catelyn
Stark
gave
the
command
to
dismount.
Rough
hands
pulled
him
down
from
his
horse,
untied
his
wrists,
and
yanked
the
hood
off
his
head.
When
he
saw
the
narrow
stony
road,
the
foothills
rising
high
and
wild
all
around
them,
and
the
jagged
snowcapped
peaks
on
the
distant
horizon,
all
the
hope
went
out
of
him
in
a
rush.
“This
is
the
high
road,”
he
gasped,
looking
at
Lady
Stark
with
accusation.
“The
eastern
road.
You
said
we
were
riding
for
Winterfell!”

Catelyn
Stark
favored
him
with
the
faintest
of
smiles.
“Often
and
loudly,”
she
agreed.
“No
doubt
your
friends
will
ride
that
way
when
they
come
after
us.
I
wish
them
good
speed.”

Even
now,
long
days
later,
the
memory
filled
him
with
a
bitter
rage.
All
his
life
Tyrion
had
prided
himself
on
his
cunning,
the
only
gift
the
gods
had
seen
fit
to
give
him,
and
yet
this
seven-times-damned
she-wolf
Catelyn
Stark
had
outwitted
him
at
every
turn.
The
knowledge
was
more
galling
than
the
bare
fact
of
his
abduction.

They
stopped
only
as
long
as
it
took
to
feed
and
water
the
horses,
and
then
they
were
off
again.
This
time
Tyrion
was
spared
the
hood.
After
the
second
night
they
no
longer
bound
his
hands,
and
once
they
had
gained
the
heights
they
scarcely
bothered
to
guard
him
at
all.
It
seemed
they
did
not
fear
his
escape.
And
why
should
they?
Up
here
the
land
was
harsh
and
wild,
and
the
high
road
little
more
than
a
stony
track.
If
he
did
run,
how
far
could
he
hope
to
go,
alone
and
without
provisions?
The
shadowcats
would
make
a
morsel
of
him,
and
the
clans
that
dwelt
in
the
mountain
fastnesses
were
brigands
and
murderers
who
bowed
to
no
law
but
the
sword.

Yet
still
the
Stark
woman
drove
them
forward
relentlessly.
He
knew
where
they
were
bound.
He
had
known
it
since
the
moment
they
pulled
off
his
hood.
These
mountains
were
the
domain
of
House
Arryn,
and
the
late
Hand’s
widow
was
a
Tully,
Catelyn
Stark’s
sister…
and
no
friend
to
the
Lannisters.
Tyrion
had
known
the
Lady
Lysa
slightly
during
her
years
at
King’s
Landing,
and
did
not
look
forward
to
renewing
the
acquaintance.

His
captors
were
clustered
around
a
stream
a
short
ways
down
the
high
road.
The
horses
had
drunk
their
fill
of
the
icy
cold
water,
and
were
grazing
on
clumps
of
brown
grass
that
grew
from
clefts
in
the
rock.
Jyck
and
Morrec
huddled
close,
sullen
and
miserable.
Mohor
stood
over
them,
leaning
on
his
spear
and
wearing
a
rounded
iron
cap
that
made
him
look
as
if
he
had
a
bowl
on
his
head.
Nearby,
Marillion
the
singer
sat
oiling
his
woodharp,
complaining
of
what
the
damp
was
doing
to
his
strings.

“We
must
have
some
rest,
my
lady,”
the
hedge
knight
Ser
Willis
Wode
was
saying
to
Catelyn
Stark
as
Tyrion
approached.
He
was
Lady
Whent’s
man,
stiff-necked
and
stolid,
and
the
first
to
rise
to
aid
Catelyn
Stark
back
at
the
inn.

“Ser
Willis
speaks
truly,
my
lady,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.
“This
is
the
third
horse
we
have
lost—”

“We
will
lose
more
than
horses
if
we’re
overtaken
by
the
Lannisters,”
she
reminded
them.
Her
face
was
windburnt
and
gaunt,
but
it
had
lost
none
of
its
determination.

“Small
chance
of
that
here,”
Tyrion
put
in.

“The
lady
did
not
ask
your
views,
dwarf,”
snapped
Kurleket,
a
great
fat
oaf
with
short-cropped
hair
and
a
pig’s
face.
He
was
one
of
the
Brackens,
a
man-at-arms
in
the
service
of
Lord
Jonos.
Tyrion
had
made
a
special
effort
to
learn
all
their
names,
so
he
might
thank
them
later
for
their
tender
treatment
of
him.
A
Lannister
always
paid
his
debts.
Kurleket
would
learn
that
someday,
as
would
his
friends
Lharys
and
Mohor,
and
the
good
Ser
Willis,
and
the
sellswords
Bronn
and
Chiggen.
He
planned
an
especially
sharp
lesson
for
Marillion,
him
of
the
woodharp
and
the
sweet
tenor
voice,
who
was
struggling
so
manfully
to
rhyme
imp
with
gimp
and
limp
so
he
could
make
a
song
of
this
outrage.

“Let
him
speak,”
Lady
Stark
commanded.

Tyrion
Lannister
seated
himself
on
a
rock.
“By
now
our
pursuit
is
likely
racing
across
the
Neck,
chasing
your
lie
up
the
kingsroad…
assuming
there
is
a
pursuit,
which
is
by
no
means
certain.
Oh,
no
doubt
the
word
has
reached
my
father…
but
my
father
does
not
love
me
overmuch,
and
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
he
will
bother
to
bestir
himself.”
It
was
only
half
a
lie;
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
cared
not
a
fig
for
his
deformed
son,
but
he
tolerated
no
slights
on
the
honor
of
his
House.
“This
is
a
cruel
land,
Lady
Stark.
You’ll
find
no
succor
until
you
reach
the
Vale,
and
each
mount
you
lose
burdens
the
others
all
the
more.
Worse,
you
risk
losing
me.
I
am
small,
and
not
strong,
and
if
I
die,
then
what’s
the
point?”
That
was
no
lie
at
all;
Tyrion
did
not
know
how
much
longer
he
could
endure
this
pace.

“It
might
be
said
that
your
death
is
the
point,
Lannister,”
Catelyn
Stark
replied.

“I
think
not,”
Tyrion
said.
“If
you
wanted
me
dead,
you
had
only
to
say
the
word,
and
one
of
these
staunch
friends
of
yours
would
gladly
have
given
me
a
red
smile.”
He
looked
at
Kurleket,
but
the
man
was
too
dim
to
taste
the
mockery.

“The
Starks
do
not
murder
men
in
their
beds.”

“Nor
do
I,”
he
said.
“I
tell
you
again,
I
had
no
part
in
the
attempt
to
kill
your
son.”

“The
assassin
was
armed
with
your
dagger.”

Tyrion
felt
the
heat
rise
in
him.
“It
was
not
my
dagger,”
he
insisted.
“How
many
times
must
I
swear
to
that?
Lady
Stark,
whatever
you
may
believe
of
me,
I
am
not
a
stupid
man.
Only
a
fool
would
arm
a
common
footpad
with
his
own
blade.”

Just
for
a
moment,
he
thought
he
saw
a
flicker
of
doubt
in
her
eyes,
but
what
she
said
was,
“Why
would
Petyr
lie
to
me?”

“Why
does
a
bear
shit
in
the
woods?”
he
demanded.
“Because
it
is
his
nature.
Lying
comes
as
easily
as
breathing
to
a
man
like
Littlefinger.
You
ought
to
know
that,
you
of
all
people.”

She
took
a
step
toward
him,
her
face
tight.
“And
what
does
that
mean,
Lannister?”

Tyrion
cocked
his
head.
“Why,
every
man
at
court
has
heard
him
tell
how
he
took
your
maidenhead,
my
lady.”

“That
is
a
lie!”
Catelyn
Stark
said.

“Oh,
wicked
little
imp,”
Marillion
said,
shocked.

Kurleket
drew
his
dirk,
a
vicious
piece
of
black
iron.
“At
your
word,
m’lady,
I’ll
toss
his
lying
tongue
at
your
feet.”
His
pig
eyes
were
wet
with
excitement
at
the
prospect.

Catelyn
Stark
stared
at
Tyrion
with
a
coldness
on
her
face
such
as
he
had
never
seen.
“Petyr
Baelish
loved
me
once.
He
was
only
a
boy.
His
passion
was
a
tragedy
for
all
of
us,
but
it
was
real,
and
pure,
and
nothing
to
be
made
mock
of.
He
wanted
my
hand.
That
is
the
truth
of
the
matter.
You
are
truly
an
evil
man,
Lannister.”

“And
you
are
truly
a
fool,
Lady
Stark.
Littlefinger
has
never
loved
anyone
but
Littlefinger,
and
I
promise
you
that
it
is
not
your
hand
that
he
boasts
of,
it’s
those
ripe
breasts
of
yours,
and
that
sweet
mouth,
and
the
heat
between
your
legs.”

Kurleket
grabbed
a
handful
of
hair
and
yanked
his
head
back
in
a
hard
jerk,
baring
his
throat.
Tyrion
felt
the
cold
kiss
of
steel
beneath
his
chin.
“Shall
I
bleed
him,
my
lady?”

“Kill
me
and
the
truth
dies
with
me,”
Tyrion
gasped.

“Let
him
talk,”
Catelyn
Stark
commanded.

Kurleket
let
go
of
Tyrion’s
hair,
reluctantly.

Tyrion
took
a
deep
breath.
“How
did
Littlefinger
tell
you
I
came
by
this
dagger
of
his?
Answer
me
that.”

“You
won
it
from
him
in
a
wager,
during
the
tourney
on
Prince
Joffrey’s
name
day.”

“When
my
brother
Jaime
was
unhorsed
by
the
Knight
of
Flowers,
that
was
his
story,
no?”

“It
was,”
she
admitted.
A
line
creased
her
brow.

“Riders!”

The
shriek
came
from
the
wind-carved
ridge
above
them.
Ser
Rodrik
had
sent
Lharys
scrambling
up
the
rock
face
to
watch
the
road
while
they
took
their
rest.

For
a
long
second,
no
one
moved.
Catelyn
Stark
was
the
first
to
react.
“Ser
Rodrik,
Ser
Willis,
to
horse,”
she
shouted.
“Get
the
other
mounts
behind
us.
Mohor,
guard
the
prisoners—”

“Arm
us!”
Tyrion
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
her
by
the
arm.
“You
will
need
every
sword.”

She
knew
he
was
right,
Tyrion
could
see
it.
The
mountain
clans
cared
nothing
for
the
enmities
of
the
great
houses;
they
would
slaughter
Stark
and
Lannister
with
equal
fervor,
as
they
slaughtered
each
other.
They
might
spare
Catelyn
herself;
she
was
still
young
enough
to
bear
sons.
Still,
she
hesitated.

“I
hear
them!”
Ser
Rodrik
called
out.
Tyrion
turned
his
head
to
listen,
and
there
it
was:
hoofbeats,
a
dozen
horses
or
more,
coming
nearer.
Suddenly
everyone
was
moving,
reaching
for
weapons,
running
to
their
mounts.

Pebbles
rained
down
around
them
as
Lharys
came
springing
and
sliding
down
the
ridge.
He
landed
breathless
in
front
of
Catelyn
Stark,
an
ungainly-looking
man
with
wild
tufts
of
rust-colored
hair
sticking
out
from
under
a
conical
steel
cap.
“Twenty
men,
maybe
twenty-five,”
he
said,
breathless.
“Milk
Snakes
or
Moon
Brothers,
by
my
guess.
They
must
have
eyes
out,
m’lady…
hidden
watchers…
they
know
we’re
here.”

Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
was
already
ahorse,
a
longsword
in
hand.
Mohor
crouched
behind
a
boulder,
both
hands
on
his
iron-tipped
spear,
a
dagger
between
his
teeth.
“You,
singer,”
Ser
Willis
Wode
called
out.
“Help
me
with
this
breastplate.”
Marillion
sat
frozen,
clutching
his
woodharp,
his
face
as
pale
as
milk,
but
Tyrion’s
man
Morrec
bounded
quickly
to
his
feet
and
moved
to
help
the
knight
with
his
armor.

Tyrion
kept
his
grip
on
Catelyn
Stark.
“You
have
no
choice,”
he
told
her.
“Three
of
us,
and
a
fourth
man
wasted
guarding
us…
four
men
can
be
the
difference
between
life
and
death
up
here.”

“Give
me
your
word
that
you
will
put
down
your
swords
again
after
the
fight
is
done.”

“My
word?”
The
hoofbeats
were
louder
now.
Tyrion
grinned
crookedly.
“Oh,
that
you
have,
my
lady…
on
my
honor
as
a
Lannister.”

For
a
moment
he
thought
she
would
spit
at
him,
but
instead
she
snapped,
“Arm
them,”
and
as
quick
as
that
she
was
pulling
away.
Ser
Rodrik
tossed
Jyck
his
sword
and
scabbard,
and
wheeled
to
meet
the
foe.
Morrec
helped
himself
to
a
bow
and
quiver,
and
>>>>>>> asd
went
to
one
knee
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
before
her.
“Your
Grace.”

“My
lady
liege.”
Spotted
Sylva
knelt
beside
him.

“My
queen,
I
am
your
man.”
Garin
dropped
to
both
knees.

Confused,
Myrcella
clutched
Arys
Oakheart
by
the
arm.
“Why
do
they
call
me
Grace?”
she
asked
in
a
plaintive
voice.
“Ser
Arys,
what
is
this
place,
and
who
are
they?”

Has
he
told
her
nought?
Arianne
moved
forward
in
a
swirl
of
silk,
smiling
to
put
the
child
at
ease.
“They
are
my
true
and
loyal
friends,
Your
Grace...
and
would
be
your
friends
as
well.”

“Princess
Arianne?”
The
girl
threw
her
arms
around
her.
“Why
do
they
call
me
queen?
Did
something
bad
happen
to
Tommen?”

“He
fell
in
with
evil
men,
Your
Grace,”
Arianne
said,
“and
I
fear
they
have
conspired
with
him
to
steal
your
throne.”

“My
throne?
You
mean,
the
Iron
Throne?”
The
girl
was
more
confused
than
ever.
“He
never
stole
that,
Tommen
is...”

“...younger
than
you,
surely?”

“I
am
older
by
a
year.”

“That
means
the
Iron
Throne
by
rights
is
yours,”
Arianne
said.
“Your
brother
is
only
a
little
boy,
you
must
not
blame
him.
He
has
bad
counselors...
but
you
have
friends.
May
I
have
the
honor
of
presenting
them?”
She
took
the
child
by
the
hand.
“Your
Grace,
I
give
you
Ser
Andrey
Dalt,
the
heir
to
Lemonwood.”

“My
friends
call
me
Drey,”
he
said,
“and
I
should
be
greatly
honored
if
Your
Grace
would
do
the
same.”

Though
Drey
had
an
open
face
and
an
easy
smile,
Myrcella
regarded
him
warily.
“Until
I
know
you
I
must
call
you
ser.”

“Whatever
name
Your
Grace
prefers,
I
am
her
man.”

Sylva
cleared
her
throat,
till
Arianne
said,
“Might
I
present
Lady
Sylva
Santagar,
my
queen?
My
dearest
Spotted
Sylva.”

“Why
do
they
call
you
that?”
Myrcella
asked.

“For
my
freckles,
Your
Grace,”
Sylva
answered,
“though
they
all
pretend
it
is
because
I
am
the
heir
to
Spottswood.”

Garin
was
next,
a
loose-limbed,
swarthy,
long-nosed
fellow
with
a
jade
stud
in
one
ear.
“Here
is
gay
Garin
of
the
orphans,
who
makes
me
laugh,”
said
Arianne.
“His
mother
was
my
wet
nurse.”

“I
am
sorry
she
is
dead,”
Myrcella
said.

“She’s
not,
sweet
queen.”
Garin
flashed
the
golden
tooth
Arianne
had
bought
him
to
replace
the
one
she’d
broken.
“I’m
of
the
orphans
of
the
Greenblood,
is
what
my
lady
means.”

Myrcella
would
have
time
enough
to
learn
the
history
of
the
orphans
on
her
voyage
up
the
river.
Arianne
led
her
queen-to-be
to
the
final
member
of
her
little
band.
“Last,
but
first
in
valor,
I
give
you
Ser
Gerold
Dayne,
a
knight
of
Starfall.”

Ser
Gerold
went
to
one
knee.
The
moonlight
shone
in
his
dark
eyes
as
he
studied
the
child
coolly.

“There
was
an
Arthur
Dayne,”
Myrcella
said.
“He
was
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
in
the
days
of
Mad
King
Aerys.”

“He
was
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
He
is
dead.”

“Are
you
the
Sword
of
the
Morning
now?”

“No.
Men
call
me
Darkstar,
and
I
am
of
the
night.”

Arianne
drew
the
child
away.
“You
must
be
hungry.
We
have
dates
and
cheese
and
olives,
and
lemonsweet
to
drink.
You
ought
not
eat
or
drink
too
much,
though.
After
a
little
rest,
we
must
ride.
Out
here
on
the
sands
it
is
always
best
to
travel
by
night,
before
the
sun
ascends
the
sky.
It
is
kinder
to
the
horses.”

“And
the
riders,”
Spotted
Sylva
said.
“Come,
Your
Grace,
warm
yourself.
I
should
be
honored
if
you’d
let
me
serve
you.”

As
she
led
the
princess
to
the
fire,
Arianne
found
Ser
Gerold
behind
her.
“My
House
goes
back
ten
thousand
years,
unto
the
dawn
of
days,”
he
complained.
“Why
is
it
that
my
cousin
is
the
only
Dayne
that
anyone
remembers?”

“He
was
a
great
knight,”
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
put
in.

“He
had
a
great
sword,”
Darkstar
said.

“And
a
great
heart.”
Ser
Arys
took
Arianne
by
the
arm.
“Princess,
I
beg
a
moment’s
word.”

“Come.”
She
led
Ser
Arys
deeper
into
the
ruins.
Beneath
his
cloak,
the
knight
wore
a
cloth-of-gold
doublet
embroidered
with
the
three
green
oak
leaves
of
his
House.
On
his
head
was
a
light
steel
helm
topped
by
a
jagged
spike,
wound
about
with
a
yellow
scarf
in
the
Dornish
fashion.
He
might
have
passed
for
any
knight,
but
for
the
cloak.
Of
shimmering
white
silk
it
was,
pale
as
moonlight
and
airy
as
a
breeze.
A
Kingsguard
cloak
beyond
all
doubt,
the
gallant
fool.
“How
much
does
the
child
know?”

“Little
enough.
Before
we
left
King’s
Landing,
her
uncle
reminded
her
that
I
was
her
protector
and
that
any
commands
that
I
might
give
her
were
meant
to
keep
her
safe.
She
has
heard
them
in
the
streets
as
well,
shouting
out
for
vengeance.
She
knew
this
was
no
game.
The
girl
is
brave,
and
wise
beyond
her
years.
She
did
all
I
asked
of
her,
and
never
asked
a
question.”
The
knight
took
her
arm,
glanced
about,
lowered
his
voice.
“There
are
other
tidings
you
should
hear.
Tywin
Lannister
is
dead.”

That
was
a
shock.
“Dead?”

“Murdered
by
the
Imp.
The
queen
has
assumed
the
regency.”

“Has
she?”
A
woman
on
the
Iron
Throne?
Arianne
thought
about
that
for
a
moment
and
decided
it
was
all
to
the
good.
If
the
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
grew
accustomed
to
Queen
Cersei’s
rule,
it
would
be
that
much
easier
for
them
to
bend
their
knees
to
Queen
Myrcella.
And
Lord
Tywin
had
been
a
dangerous
foe;
without
him,
Dorne’s
enemies
would
be
much
weaker.
Lannisters
are
killing
Lannisters,
how
sweet.
“What
became
of
the
dwarf?”

“He’s
fled,”
Ser
Arys
said.
“Cersei
is
offering
a
lordship
to
whosoever
delivers
her
his
head.”
In
a
tiled
inner
courtyard
half-buried
by
the
drifting
sands,
he
pushed
her
back
against
a
column
to
kiss
her,
and
his
hand
went
to
her
breast.
He
kissed
her
long
and
hard
and
would
have
pushed
her
skirts
up,
but
Arianne
broke
free
of
him,
laughing.
“I
see
that
queenmaking
excites
you,
ser,
but
we
have
no
time
for
this.
Later,
I
promise
you.”
She
touched
his
cheek.
“Did
you
meet
with
any
problems?”

“Only
Trystane.
He
wanted
to
sit
beside
Myrcella’s
bedside
and
play
cyvasse
with
her.”

“He
had
redspots
when
he
was
four,
I
told
you.
You
can
only
get
it
once.
You
should
have
put
out
that
Myrcella
was
suffering
from
greyscale,
that
would
have
kept
him
well
away.”

“The
boy
perhaps,
but
not
your
father’s
maester.”

“Caleotte,”
she
said.
“Did
he
try
to
see
her?”

“Not
once
I
described
the
red
spots
on
her
face.
He
said
that
nothing
could
be
done
until
the
disease
had
run
its
course,
and
gave
me
a
pot
of
salve
to
soothe
her
itching.”

No
one
under
ten
ever
died
of
redspots,
but
it
could
be
mortal
in
adults,
and
Maester
Caleotte
had
never
suffered
it
as
a
child.
Arianne
learned
that
when
she
suffered
her
own
spots,
at
eight.
“Good,”
she
said.
“And
the
handmaid?
Is
she
convincing?”

“From
a
distance.
The
Imp
picked
her
for
this
purpose,
over
many
girls
of
nobler
birth.
Myrcella
helped
her
curl
her
hair,
and
painted
the
dots
on
her
face
herself.
They
are
distant
kin.
Lannisport
teems
with
Lannys,
Lannetts,
Lantells,
and
lesser
Lannisters,
and
half
of
them
have
that
yellow
hair.
Dressed
in
Myrcella’s
bedrobe
with
the
maester’s
salve
smeared
across
her
face...
she
might
even
have
fooled
me,
in
a
dim
light.
It
was
a
deal
harder
to
find
a
man
to
take
my
place.
Dake
is
closest
to
my
height,
but
he’s
too
fat,
so
I
put
Rolder
in
my
armor
and
told
him
to
keep
his
visor
down.
The
man
is
three
inches
shorter
than
I
am,
but
perhaps
no
one
will
notice
if
I’m
not
there
to
stand
beside
him.
He’ll
keep
to
Myrcella’s
chambers
in
any
case.”

“All
we
need
is
a
few
days.
By
that
time
the
princess
will
be
beyond
my
father’s
reach.”

“Where?”
He
drew
her
close
and
nuzzled
at
her
neck.
“It’s
time
you
told
me
the
rest
of
the
plan,
don’t
you
think?”

She
laughed,
pushing
him
away.
“No,
it’s
time
we
rode.”

The
moon
had
crowned
the
Moonmaid
as
they
set
out
from
the
dust-dry
ruins
of
Shandystone,
striking
south
and
west.
Arianne
and
Ser
Arys
took
the
lead,
with
Myrcella
on
a
frisky
mare
between
them.
Garin
followed
close
behind
with
Spotted
Sylva,
whilst
her
two
Dornish
knights
took
the
rear.
We
are
seven,
Arianne
realized
as
they
rode.
She
had
not
thought
of
that
before,
but
it
seemed
a
good
omen
for
their
cause.
Seven
riders
on
their
way
to
glory.
One
day
the
singers
will
make
all
of
us
immortal.
Drey
had
wanted
a
larger
party,
but
that
might
have
attracted
unwelcome
attention,
and
every
additional
man
doubled
the
risk
of
betrayal.
That
much
my
father
taught
me,
at
the
least.
Even
when
he
was
younger
and
stronger,
Doran
Martell
had
been
a
cautious
man
much
given
to
silences
and
secrets.
It
is
time
he
put
his
burdens
down,
but
I
will
suffer
no
slights
to
his
honor
or
his
person.
She
would
return
him
to
his
Water
Gardens,
to
live
out
what
years
remained
him
surrounded
by
laughing
children
and
the
smell
of
limes
and
oranges.
Yes,
and
Quentyn
can
keep
him
company.
Once
I
crown
Myrcella
and
free
the
Sand
Snakes,
all
Dorne
will
rally
to
my
banners.
The
Yronwoods
might
declare
for
Quentyn,
but
alone
they
were
no
threat.
If
they
went
over
to
Tommen
and
the
Lannisters,
she
would
have
Darkstar
destroy
them
root
and
branch.

“I
am
tired,”
Myrcella
complained,
after
several
hours
in
the
saddle.
“Is
it
much
farther?
Where
are
we
going?”

“Princess
Arianne
is
taking
Your
Grace
to
a
place
where
you’ll
be
safe,”
Ser
Arys
assured
her.

“It
is
a
long
journey,”
Arianne
said,
“but
it
will
go
easier
once
we
reach
the
Greenblood.
Some
of
Garin’s
people
will
meet
us
there,
the
orphans
of
the
river.
They
live
on
boats,
and
pole
them
up
and
down
the
Greenblood
and
its
vassals,
fishing
and
picking
fruit
and
doing
whatever
work
needs
doing.”

“Aye,”
Garin
called
out
cheerfully,
“and
we
sing
and
play
and
dance
on
water,
and
know
much
and
more
of
healing.
My
mother
is
the
best
midwife
in
Westeros,
and
my
father
can
cure
warts.”

“How
can
you
be
orphans
if
you
have
mothers
and
fathers?”
the
girl
asked.

“They
are
the
Rhoynar,”
Arianne
explained,
“and
their
Mother
was
the
river
Rhoyne.”

Myrcella
did
not
understand.
“I
thought
you
were
the
Rhoynar.
You
Dornishmen,
I
mean.”

“We
are
in
part,
Your
Grace.
Nymeria’s
blood
is
in
me,
along
with
that
of
Mors
Martell,
the
Dornish
lord
she
married.
On
the
day
they
wed,
Nymeria
fired
her
ships,
so
her
people
would
understand
that
there
could
be
no
going
back.
Most
were
glad
to
see
those
flames,
for
their
voyagings
had
been
long
and
terrible
before
they
came
to
Dorne,
and
many
and
more
had
been
lost
to
storm,
disease,
and
slavery.
There
were
a
few
who
mourned,
however.
They
did
not
love
this
dry
red
land
or
its
seven-faced
god,
so
they
clung
to
their
old
ways,
hammered
boats
together
from
the
hulks
of
the
burned
ships,
and
became
the
orphans
of
the
Greenblood.
The
Mother
in
their
songs
is
not
our
Mother,
but
Mother
Rhoyne,
whose
waters
nourished
them
from
the
dawn
of
days.”

“I’d
heard
the
Rhoynar
had
some
turtle
god,”
said
Ser
Arys.

“The
Old
Man
of
the
River
is
a
lesser
god,”
said
Garin.
“He
was
born
from
Mother
River
too,
and
fought
the
Crab
King
to
win
dominion
over
all
who
dwell
beneath
the
flowing
waters.”

“Oh,”
said
Myrcella.

“I
understand
you’ve
fought
some
mighty
battles
too,
Your
Grace,”
said
Drey
in
his
most
cheerful
voice.
“It
is
said
you
show
our
brave
Prince
Trystane
no
mercy
at
the
cyvasse
table.”

“He
always
sets
his
squares
up
the
same
way,
with
all
the
mountains
in
the
front
and
his
elephants
in
the
passes,”
said
Myrcella.
“So
I
send
my
dragon
through
to
eat
his
elephants.”

“Does
your
handmaid
play
the
game
as
well?”
asked
Drey.

“Rosamund?”
asked
Myrcella.
“No.
I
tried
to
teach
her,
but
she
said
the
rules
were
too
hard.”

“She
is
a
Lannister
as
well?”
said
Lady
Sylva.

“A
Lannister
of
Lannisport,
not
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock.
Her
hair
is
the
same
color
as
mine,
but
straight
instead
of
curly.
Rosamund
doesn’t
truly
favor
me,
but
when
she
dresses
up
in
my
clothes
people
who
don’t
know
us
think
she’s
me.”

“You
have
done
this
before,
then?”

“Oh,
yes.
We
traded
places
on
the
Seaswift,
on
the
way
to
Braavos.
Septa
Eglantine
put
brown
dye
in
my
hair.
She
said
we
were
doing
it
as
a
game,
but
it
was
meant
to
keep
me
safe
in
case
the
ship
was
taken
by
my
uncle
Stannis.”

The
girl
was
plainly
growing
tired,
so
Arianne
called
a
halt.
They
watered
the
horses
once
again,
rested
for
a
bit,
and
had
some
cheese
and
fruit.
Myrcella
split
an
orange
with
Spotted
Sylva,
whilst
Garin
ate
olives
and
spit
the
stones
at
Drey.

Arianne
had
hoped
to
reach
the
river
before
the
sun
came
up,
but
they
had
started
much
later
than
she’d
planned,
so
they
were
still
in
the
saddle
when
the
eastern
sky
turned
red.
Darkstar
cantered
up
beside
her.
“Princess,”
he
said,
“I’d
set
a
faster
pace,
unless
you
mean
to
kill
the
child
after
all.
We
have
no
tents,
and
by
day
the
sands
are
cruel.”

“I
know
the
sands
as
well
as
you
do,
ser,”
she
told
him.
All
the
same,
she
did
as
he
suggested.
It
was
hard
on
their
mounts,
but
better
she
should
lose
six
horses
than
one
princess.

Soon
enough
the
wind
came
gusting
from
the
west,
hot
and
dry
and
full
of
grit.
Arianne
drew
her
veil
across
her
face.
It
was
made
of
shimmering
silk,
pale
green
above
and
yellow
below,
the
colors
blending
into
one
another.
Small
green
pearls
gave
it
weight,
and
rattled
softly
against
each
other
as
she
rode.

“I
know
why
my
princess
wears
a
veil,”
Ser
Arys
said
as
she
was
fastening
it
to
the
temples
of
her
copper
helm.
“Elsewise
her
beauty
would
outshine
the
sun
above.”

She
had
to
laugh.
“No,
your
princess
wears
a
veil
to
keep
the
glare
out
of
her
eyes
and
the
sand
out
of
her
mouth.
You
should
do
the
same,
ser.”
She
wondered
how
long
her
white
knight
had
been
polishing
his
ponderous
gallantry.
Ser
Arys
was
pleasant
company
abed,
but
wit
and
he
were
strangers.

Her
Dornishmen
covered
their
faces
as
she
did,
and
Spotted
Sylva
helped
veil
the
little
princess
from
the
sun,
but
Ser
Arys
stayed
stubborn.
Before
long
the
sweat
was
running
down
his
face,
and
his
cheeks
had
taken
on
a
rosy
blush.
Much
longer
and
he
will
cook
in
those
heavy
clothes,
she
reflected.
He
would
not
be
the
first.
In
centuries
past,
many
a
host
had
come
down
from
the
Prince’s
Pass
with
banners
streaming,
only
to
wither
and
broil
on
the
hot
red
Dornish
sands.
“The
arms
of
House
Martell
display
the
sun
and
spear,
the
Dornishman’s
two
favored
weapons,”
the
Young
Dragon
had
once
written
in
his
boastful
Conquest
of
Dorne,
“but
of
the
two,
the
sun
is
the
more
deadly.”

Thankfully,
they
did
not
need
to
cross
the
deep
sands
but
only
a
sliver
of
the
drylands.
When
Arianne
spied
a
hawk
wheeling
high
above
them
against
a
cloudless
sky,
she
knew
the
worst
was
behind
them.
Soon
they
came
upon
a
tree.
It
was
a
gnarled
and
twisted
thing
with
as
many
thorns
as
leaves,
of
the
sort
called
sandbeggars,
but
it
meant
that
they
were
not
far
from
water.

“We’re
almost
there,
Your
Grace,”
Garin
told
Myrcella
cheerfully
when
they
spied
more
sandbeggars
up
ahead,
a
thicket
of
them
growing
all
around
the
dry
bed
of
a
stream.
The
sun
was
beating
down
like
a
fiery
hammer,
but
it
did
not
matter
with
their
journey
at
its
end.
They
stopped
to
water
the
horses
again,
drank
deep
from
their
skins
and
wet
their
veils,
then
mounted
for
the
last
push.
Within
half
a
league
they
were
riding
over
devilgrass
and
past
olive
groves.
Beyond
a
line
of
stony
hills
the
grass
grew
greener
and
more
lush,
and
there
were
lemon
orchards
watered
by
a
spider’s
web
of
old
canals.
Garin
was
the
first
to
spy
the
river
glimmering
green.
He
gave
a
shout
and
raced
ahead.

Arianne
Martell
had
crossed
the
Mander
once,
when
she
had
gone
with
three
of
the
Sand
Snakes
to
visit
Tyene’s
mother.
Compared
to
that
mighty
waterway,
the
Greenblood
was
scarce
worthy
of
the
name
of
river,
yet
it
remained
the
life
of
Dorne.
It
took
its
name
from
the
murky
green
of
its
sluggish
waters;
but
as
they
approached,
the
sunlight
seemed
to
turn
those
waters
gold.
She
had
seldom
seen
a
sweeter
sight.
The
next
part
should
be
slow
and
simple,
she
thought,
up
the
Greenblood
and
onto
the
Vaith,
as
far
as
a
poleboat
can
go.
That
would
give
her
time
enough
to
prepare
Myrcella
for
all
that
was
to
come.
Beyond
Vaith
the
deep
sands
waited.
They
would
need
help
from
Sandstone
and
the
Hellholt
to
make
that
crossing,
but
she
did
not
doubt
that
it
would
be
forthcoming.
The
Red
Viper
had
been
fostered
at
Sandstone,
and
Prince
Oberyn’s
paramour
Ellaria
Sand
was
Lord
Uller’s
natural
daughter;
four
of
the
Sand
Snakes
were
his
granddaughters.
I
will
crown
Myrcella
at
the
Hellholt
and
raise
my
banners
there.

They
found
the
boat
half
a
league
downstream,
hidden
beneath
the
drooping
branches
of
a
great
green
willow.
Low
of
roof
and
wide
abeam,
the
poleboats
had
hardly
any
draft
to
speak
of;
the
Young
Dragon
had
disparaged
them
as
“hovels
built
on
rafts,”
but
that
was
hardly
fair.
All
but
the
poorest
orphan
boats
were
wonderfully
carved
and
painted.
This
one
was
done
in
shades
of
green,
with
a
curved
wooden
tiller
shaped
like
a
mermaid,
and
fish
faces
peering
through
her
rails.
Poles
and
ropes
and
jars
of
olive
oil
cluttered
her
decks,
and
iron
lanterns
swung
fore
and
aft.
Arianne
saw
no
orphans.
Where
is
her
crew?
she
wondered.

Garin
reined
up
beneath
the
willow.
“Wake
up,
you
fish-eyed
lagabeds,”
he
called
as
he
leapt
down
from
the
saddle.
“Your
queen
is
here,
and
wants
her
royal
welcome.
Come
up,
come
out,
we’ll
have
some
songs
and
sweetwine.
My
mouth
is
set
for—”

The
door
on
the
poleboat
slammed
open.
Out
into
the
sunlight
stepped
Areo
Hotah,
longaxe
in
hand.

Garin
jerked
to
a
halt.
Arianne
felt
as
though
an
axe
had
caught
her
in
the
belly.
It
was
not
supposed
to
end
this
way.
This
was
not
supposed
to
happen.
When
she
heard
Drey
say,
“There’s
the
last
face
I’d
hoped
to
see,”
she
knew
she
had
to
act.
“Away!”
she
cried,
vaulting
back
into
the
saddle.
“Arys,
protect
the
princess—”

Hotah
thumped
the
butt
of
his
longaxe
upon
the
deck.
Behind
the
ornate
rails
of
the
poleboat,
a
dozen
guardsmen
rose,
armed
with
throwing
spears
or
crossbows.
Still
more
appeared
atop
the
cabin.
“Yield,
my
princess,”
the
captain
called,
“else
we
must
slay
all
but
the
child
and
yourself,
by
your
father’s
word.”

Princess
Myrcella
sat
motionless
upon
her
mount.
Garin
backed
slowly
from
the
poleboat,
his
hands
in
the
air.
Drey
unbuckled
his
swordbelt.
“Yielding
seems
the
wisest
course,”
he
called
to
Arianne,
as
his
sword
thumped
to
the
ground.

“No!”
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
put
his
horse
between
Arianne
and
the
crossbows,
his
blade
shining
silver
in
his
hand.
He
had
unslung
his
shield
and
slipped
his
left
arm
through
the
straps.
“You
will
not
take
her
whilst
I
still
draw
breath.”

You
reckless
fool,
was
all
that
Arianne
had
time
to
think,
what
do
you
think
you’re
doing?

Darkstar’s
laughter
rang
out.
“Are
you
blind
or
stupid,
Oakheart?
There
are
too
many.
Put
up
your
sword.”

“Do
as
he
says,
Ser
Arys,”
Drey
urged.

We
are
taken,
ser,
Arianne
might
have
called
out.
Your
death
will
not
free
us.
If
you
love
your
princess,
yield.
But
when
she
tried
to
speak,
the
words
caught
in
her
throat.

Ser
Arys
Oakheart
gave
her
one
last
longing
look,
then
put
his
golden
spurs
into
his
horse
and
charged.

He
rode
headlong
for
the
poleboat,
his
white
cloak
streaming
behind
him.
Arianne
Martell
had
never
seen
anything
half
so
gallant,
or
half
so
stupid.
“Noooo,”
she
shrieked,
but
she
had
found
her
tongue
too
late.
A
crossbow
thrummed,
then
another.
Hotah
bellowed
a
command.
At
such
close
range,
the
white
knight’s
armor
had
as
well
been
made
of
parchment.
The
first
bolt
punched
right
through
his
heavy
oaken
shield,
pinning
it
to
his
shoulder.
The
second
grazed
his
temple.
A
thrown
spear
took
Ser
Arys’s
mount
in
the
flank,
yet
still
the
horse
came
on,
staggering
as
he
hit
the
gangplank.
“No,”
some
girl
was
shouting,
some
foolish
little
girl,
“no,
please,
this
was
not
supposed
to
happen.”
She
could
hear
Myrcella
shrieking
too,
her
voice
shrill
with
fear.

Ser
Arys’s
longsword
slashed
right
and
left,
and
two
spearmen
went
down.
His
horse
reared,
and
kicked
a
crossbowman
in
the
face
as
he
was
trying
to
reload,
but
the
other
crossbows
were
firing,
feathering
the
big
courser
with
their
quarrels.
The
bolts
hit
home
so
hard
they
knocked
the
horse
sideways.
His
legs
went
out
from
under
him
and
sent
him
crashing
down
the
deck.
Somehow
Arys
Oakheart
leapt
free.
He
even
managed
to
keep
hold
of
his
sword.
He
struggled
to
his
knees
beside
his
dying
horse...

...and
found
Areo
Hotah
standing
over
him.

The
white
knight
raised
his
blade,
too
slowly.
Hotah’s
longaxe
took
his
right
arm
off
at
the
shoulder,
spun
away
spraying
blood,
and
came
flashing
back
again
in
a
terrible
two-handed
slash
that
removed
the
head
of
Arys
Oakheart
and
sent
it
spinning
through
the
air.
It
landed
amongst
the
reeds,
and
the
Greenblood
swallowed
the
red
with
a
soft
splash.

Arianne
did
not
remember
climbing
from
her
horse.
Perhaps
she’d
fallen.
She
did
not
remember
that
either.
Yet
she
found
herself
on
her
hands
and
feet
in
the
sand,
shaking
and
sobbing
and
retching
up
her
supper.
No,
was
all
that
she
could
think,
no,
no
one
was
to
be
hurt,
it
was
all
planned,
I
was
so
careful.
She
heard
Areo
Hotah
roar,
“After
him.
He
must
not
escape.
After
him!”
Myrcella
was
on
the
ground,
wailing,
shaking,
her
pale
face
in
her
hands,
blood
streaming
through
her
fingers.
Arianne
did
not
understand.
Men
were
scrambling
onto
horses
whilst
others
swarmed
over
her
and
her
companions,
but
none
of
it
made
sense.
She
had
fallen
into
a
dream,
some
terrible
red
nightmare.
This
cannot
be
real.
I
will
wake
soon,
and
laugh
at
my
night
terrors.

When
they
sought
to
bind
her
hands
behind
her
back,
she
did
not
resist.
One
of
the
guardsmen
jerked
her
to
her
feet.
He
wore
her
father’s
colors.
Another
bent
and
seized
the
throwing
knife
inside
her
boot,
a
gift
from
her
cousin
Lady
Nym.

Areo
Hotah
took
it
from
the
man
and
frowned
at
it.
“The
prince
said
I
must
bring
you
back
to
Sunspear,”
he
announced.
His
cheeks
and
brow
were
freckled
with
the
blood
of
Arys
Oakheart.
“I
am
sorry,
little
princess.”

Arianne
raised
a
tear-streaked
face.
“How
could
he
know?”
she
asked
the
captain.
“I
was
so
careful.
How
could
he
know?”

“Someone
told.”
Hotah
shrugged.
“Someone
always
tells.”





ARYA

Each
night
before
sleep,
she
murmured
her
prayer
into
her
pillow.
“Ser
Gregor,”
it
went.
“Dunsen,
Raff
the
Sweetling,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.”
She
would
have
whispered
the
names
of
the
Freys
of
the
Crossing
too,
if
she
had
known
them.
One
day
I’ll
know,
she
told
herself,
and
then
I’ll
kill
them
all.

No
whisper
was
too
faint
to
be
heard
in
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
“Child,”
said
the
kindly
man
one
day,
“what
are
those
names
you
whisper
of
a
night?”

“I
don’t
whisper
any
names,”
she
said.

“You
lie,”
he
said.
“All
men
lie
when
they
are
afraid.
Some
tell
many
lies,
some
but
a
few.
Some
have
only
one
great
lie
they
tell
so
often
that
they
almost
come
to
believe
it...
though
some
small
part
of
them
will
always
know
that
it
is
still
a
lie,
and
that
will
show
upon
their
faces.
Tell
me
of
these
names.”

She
chewed
her
lip.
“The
names
don’t
matter.”

“They
do,”
the
kindly
man
insisted.
“Tell
me,
child.”

Tell
me,
or
we
will
turn
you
out,
she
heard.
“They’re
people
I
hate.
I
want
them
to
die.”

“We
hear
many
such
prayers
in
this
House.”

“I
know,”
said
Arya.
Jaqen
H’ghar
had
granted
three
of
her
prayers
once.
All
I
had
to
do
was
whisper...

“Is
that
why
you
have
come
to
us?”
the
kindly
man
went
on.
“To
learn
our
arts,
so
you
may
kill
these
men
you
hate?”

Arya
did
not
know
how
to
answer
that.
“Maybe.”

“Then
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
place.
It
is
not
for
you
to
say
who
shall
live
and
who
shall
die.
That
gift
belongs
to
Him
of
Many
Faces.
We
are
but
his
servants,
sworn
to
do
his
will.”

“Oh.”
Arya
glanced
at
the
statues
that
stood
along
the
walls,
candles
glimmering
round
their
feet.
“Which
god
is
he?”

“Why,
all
of
them,”
said
the
priest
in
black
and
white.

He
never
told
her
his
name.
Neither
did
the
waif,
the
little
girl
with
the
big
eyes
and
hollow
face
who
reminded
her
of
another
little
girl,
named
Weasel.
Like
Arya,
the
waif
lived
below
the
temple,
along
with
three
acolytes,
two
serving
men,
and
a
cook
called
Umma.
Umma
liked
to
talk
as
she
worked,
but
Arya
could
not
understand
a
word
she
said.
The
others
had
no
names,
or
did
not
choose
to
share
them.
One
serving
man
was
very
old,
his
back
bent
like
a
bow.
The
second
was
red-faced,
with
hair
growing
from
his
ears.
She
took
them
both
for
mutes
until
she
heard
them
praying.
The
acolytes
were
younger.
The
eldest
was
her
father’s
age;
the
other
two
could
not
have
been
much
older
than
Sansa,
who
had
been
her
sister.
The
acolytes
wore
black
and
white
too,
but
their
robes
had
no
cowls,
and
were
black
on
the
left
side
and
white
on
the
right.
With
the
kindly
man
and
the
waif,
it
was
the
opposite.
Arya
was
given
servant’s
garb:
a
tunic
of
undyed
wool,
baggy
breeches,
linen
smallclothes,
cloth
slippers
for
her
feet.

Only
the
kindly
man
knew
the
Common
Tongue.
“Who
are
you?”
he
would
ask
her
every
day.

“No
one,”
she
would
answer,
she
who
had
been
Arya
of
House
Stark,
Arya
Underfoot,
Arya
Horseface.
She
had
been
Arry
and
Weasel
too,
and
Squab
and
Salty,
Nan
the
cupbearer,
a
grey
mouse,
a
sheep,
the
ghost
of
Harrenhal...
but
not
for
true,
not
in
her
heart
of
hearts.
In
there
she
was
Arya
of
Winterfell,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Eddard
Stark
and
Lady
Catelyn,
who
had
once
had
brothers
named
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
a
sister
named
Sansa,
a
direwolf
called
Nymeria,
a
half
brother
named
Jon
Snow.
In
there
she
was
someone...
but
that
was
not
the
answer
that
he
wanted.

Without
a
common
language,
Arya
had
no
way
of
talking
to
the
others.
She
listened
to
them,
though,
and
repeated
the
words
she
heard
to
herself
as
she
went
about
her
work.
Though
the
youngest
acolyte
was
blind,
he
had
charge
of
the
candles.
He
would
walk
the
temple
in
soft
slippers,
surrounded
by
the
murmurings
of
the
old
women
who
came
each
day
to
pray.
Even
without
eyes,
he
always
knew
which
candles
had
gone
out.
“He
has
the
scent
to
guide
him,”
the
kindly
man
explained,
“and
the
air
is
warmer
where
a
candle
burns.”
He
told
Arya
to
close
her
eyes
and
try
it
for
herself.

They
prayed
at
dawn
before
they
broke
their
fast,
kneeling
around
the
still,
black
pool.
Some
days
the
kindly
man
led
the
prayer.
Other
days
it
was
the
waif.
Arya
only
knew
a
few
words
of
Braavosi,
the
ones
that
were
the
same
in
High
Valyrian.
So
she
prayed
her
own
prayer
to
the
Many-Faced
God,
the
one
that
went,
“Ser
Gregor,
Dunsen,
Raff
the
Sweetling,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.”
She
prayed
in
silence.
If
the
Many-Faced
God
was
a
proper
god,
he
would
hear
her.

Worshipers
came
to
the
House
of
Black
and
White
every
day.
Most
came
alone
and
sat
alone;
they
lit
candles
at
one
altar
or
another,
prayed
beside
the
pool,
and
sometimes
wept.
A
few
drank
from
the
black
cup
and
went
to
sleep;
more
did
not
drink.
There
were
no
services,
no
songs,
no
paeans
of
praise
to
please
the
god.
The
temple
was
never
full.
From
time
to
time,
a
worshiper
would
ask
to
see
a
priest,
and
the
kindly
man
or
the
waif
would
take
him
down
into
the
sanctum,
but
that
did
not
happen
often.

Thirty
different
gods
stood
along
the
walls,
surrounded
by
their
little
lights.
The
Weeping
Woman
was
the
favorite
of
old
women,
Arya
saw;
rich
men
preferred
the
Lion
of
Night,
poor
men
the
Hooded
Wayfarer.
Soldiers
lit
candles
to
Bakkalon,
the
Pale
Child,
sailors
to
the
Moon-Pale
Maiden
and
the
Merling
King.
The
Stranger
had
his
shrine
as
well,
though
hardly
anyone
ever
came
to
him.
Most
of
the
time
only
a
single
candle
stood
flickering
at
his
feet.
The
kindly
man
said
it
did
not
matter.
“He
has
many
faces,
and
many
ears
to
hear.”

The
knoll
on
which
the
temple
stood
was
honeycombed
with
passageways
hewn
from
the
rock.
The
priests
and
acolytes
had
their
sleeping
cells
on
the
first
level,
Arya
and
the
servants
on
the
second.
The
lowest
level
was
forbidden
to
all
save
the
priests.
That
was
where
the
holy
sanctum
lay.

When
she
was
not
working,
Arya
was
free
to
wander
as
she
would
amongst
the
vaults
and
storerooms,
so
long
as
she
did
not
leave
the
temple,
nor
descend
to
the
third
cellar.
She
found
a
room
full
of
weapons
and
armor:
ornate
helms
and
curious
old
breastplates,
longswords,
daggers,
and
dirks,
crossbows
and
tall
spears
with
leaf-shaped
heads.
Another
vault
was
crammed
with
clothing,
thick
furs
and
splendid
silks
in
half
a
hundred
colors,
next
to
piles
of
foul-smelling
rags
and
threadbare
roughspuns.
There
must
be
treasure
chambers
too,
Arya
decided.
She
pictured
stacks
of
golden
plates,
bags
of
silver
coins,
sapphires
blue
as
the
sea,
ropes
of
fat
green
pearls.

One
day
the
kindly
man
came
on
her
unexpectedly
and
asked
what
she
was
doing.
She
told
him
that
she
had
gotten
lost.

“You
lie.
Worse,
you
lie
poorly.
Who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

“Another
lie.”
He
sighed.

Weese
would
have
beaten
her
bloody
if
he
had
caught
her
in
a
lie,
but
it
was
different
in
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
When
she
was
helping
in
the
kitchen,
Umma
would
sometimes
smack
her
with
her
spoon
if
she
got
in
the
way,
but
no
one
else
ever
raised
a
hand
to
her.
They
only
raise
their
hands
to
kill,
she
thought.

She
got
along
well
enough
with
the
cook.
Umma
would
slap
a
knife
into
her
hand
and
point
at
an
onion,
and
Arya
would
chop
it.
Umma
would
shove
her
toward
a
mound
of
dough,
and
Arya
would
knead
it
until
the
cook
said
stop
(stop
was
the
first
Braavosi
word
she
learned).
Umma
would
hand
her
a
fish,
and
Arya
would
bone
it
and
fillet
it
and
roll
it
in
the
nuts
the
cook
was
crushing.
The
brackish
waters
that
surrounded
Braavos
teemed
with
fish
and
shellfish
of
every
sort,
the
kindly
man
explained.
A
slow
brown
river
entered
the
lagoon
from
the
south,
wandering
through
a
wide
expanse
of
reeds,
tidal
pools,
and
mudflats.
Clams
and
cockles
abounded
hereabouts;
mussels
and
muskfish,
frogs
and
turtles,
mud
crabs
and
leopard
crabs
and
climber
crabs,
red
eels,
black
eels,
striped
eels,
lampreys,
and
oysters;
all
made
frequent
appearances
on
the
carved
wooden
table
where
the
servants
of
the
Many-Faced
God
took
their
meals.
Some
nights
Umma
spiced
the
fish
with
sea
salt
and
cracked
peppercorns,
or
cooked
the
eels
with
chopped
garlic.
Once
in
a
great
while
the
cook
would
even
use
some
saffron.
Hot
Pie
would
have
liked
it
here,
Arya
thought.

Supper
was
her
favorite
time.
It
had
been
a
long
while
since
Arya
had
gone
to
sleep
every
night
with
a
full
belly.
Some
nights
the
kindly
man
would
allow
her
to
ask
him
questions.
Once
she
asked
him
why
the
people
who
came
to
the
temple
always
seemed
so
peaceful;
back
home,
people
were
scared
to
die.
She
remembered
how
that
pimply
squire
had
wept
when
she
stabbed
him
in
the
belly,
and
the
way
Ser
Amory
Lorch
had
begged
when
the
Goat
had
him
thrown
in
the
bear
pit.
She
remembered
the
village
by
the
God’s
Eye,
and
the
way
the
villagers
shrieked
and
screamed
and
whimpered
whenever
the
Tickler
started
asking
after
gold.

“Death
is
not
the
worst
thing,”
the
kindly
man
replied.
“It
is
His
gift
to
us,
an
end
to
want
and
pain.
On
the
day
that
we
are
born
the
Many-Faced
God
sends
each
of
us
a
dark
angel
to
walk
through
life
beside
us.
When
our
sins
and
our
sufferings
grow
too
great
to
be
borne,
the
angel
takes
us
by
the
hand
to
lead
us
to
the
nightlands,
where
the
stars
burn
ever
bright.
Those
who
come
to
drink
from
the
black
cup
are
looking
for
their
angels.
If
they
are
afraid,
the
candles
soothe
them.
When
you
smell
our
candles
burning,
what
does
it
make
you
think
of,
my
child?”

Winterfell,
she
might
have
said.
I
smell
snow
and
smoke
and
pine
needles.
I
smell
the
stables.
I
smell
Hodor
laughing,
and
Jon
and
Robb
battling
in
the
yard,
and
Sansa
singing
about
some
stupid
lady
fair.
I
smell
the
crypts
where
the
stone
kings
sit,
I
smell
hot
bread
baking,
I
smell
the
godswood.
I
smell
my
wolf,
I
smell
her
fur,
almost
as
if
she
were
still
beside
me.
“I
don’t
smell
anything,”
she
said,
to
see
what
he
would
say.

“You
lie,”
he
said,
“but
you
may
keep
your
secrets
if
you
wish,
Arya
of
House
Stark.”
He
only
called
her
that
when
she
displeased
him.
“You
know
that
you
may
leave
this
place.
You
are
not
one
of
us,
not
yet.
You
may
go
home
anytime
you
wish.”

“You
told
me
that
if
I
left,
I
couldn’t
come
back.”

“Just
so.”

Those
words
made
her
sad.
Syrio
used
to
say
that
too,
Arya
remembered.
He
said
it
all
the
time.
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her
needlework
and
died
for
her.
“I
don’t
want
to
leave.”

“Then
stay...
but
remember,
the
House
of
Black
and
White
is
not
a
home
for
orphans.
All
men
must
serve
beneath
this
roof.
Valar
dohaeris
is
how
we
say
it
here.
Remain
if
you
will,
but
know
that
we
shall
require
your
obedience.
At
all
times
and
in
all
things.
If
you
cannot
obey,
you
must
depart.”

“I
can
obey.”

“We
shall
see.”

She
had
other
tasks
besides
helping
Umma.
She
swept
the
temple
floors;
she
served
and
poured
at
meals;
she
sorted
piles
of
dead
men’s
clothing,
emptied
their
purses,
and
counted
out
stacks
of
queer
coins.
Every
morning
she
walked
beside
the
kindly
man
as
he
made
his
circuit
of
the
temple
to
find
the
dead.
Silent
as
a
shadow,
she
would
tell
herself,
remembering
Syrio.
She
carried
a
lantern
with
thick
iron
shutters.
At
each
alcove,
she
would
open
the
shutter
a
crack,
to
look
for
corpses.

The
dead
were
never
hard
to
find.
They
came
to
the
House
of
Black
and
White,
prayed
for
an
hour
or
a
day
or
a
year,
drank
sweet
dark
water
from
the
pool,
and
stretched
out
on
a
stone
bed
behind
one
god
or
another.
They
closed
their
eyes,
and
slept,
and
never
woke.
“The
gift
of
the
Many-Faced
God
takes
myriad
forms,”
the
kindly
man
told
her,
“but
here
it
is
always
gentle.”
When
they
found
a
body
he
would
say
a
prayer
and
make
certain
life
had
fled,
and
Arya
would
fetch
the
serving
men,
whose
task
it
was
to
carry
the
dead
down
to
the
vaults.
There
acolytes
would
strip
and
wash
the
bodies.
The
dead
men’s
clothes
and
coins
and
valuables
went
into
a
bin
for
sorting.
Their
cold
flesh
would
be
taken
to
the
lower
sanctum
where
only
the
priests
could
go;
what
happened
in
there
Arya
was
not
allowed
to
know.
Once,
as
she
was
eating
her
supper,
a
terrible
suspicion
seized
hold
of
her,
and
she
put
down
her
knife
and
stared
suspiciously
at
a
slice
of
pale
white
meat.
The
kindly
man
saw
the
horror
on
her
face.
“It
is
pork,
child,”
he
told
her,
“only
pork.”

Her
bed
was
stone,
and
reminded
her
of
Harrenhal
and
the
bed
she’d
slept
in
when
scrubbing
steps
for
Weese.
The
mattress
was
stuffed
with
rags
instead
of
straw,
which
made
it
lumpier
than
the
one
she’d
had
at
Harrenhal,
but
less
scratchy
too.
She
was
allowed
as
many
blankets
as
she
wished;
thick
woolen
blankets,
red
and
green
and
plaid.
And
her
cell
was
hers
alone.
She
kept
her
treasures
there:
the
silver
fork
and
floppy
hat
and
fingerless
gloves
given
her
by
the
sailors
on
the
Titan’s
Daughter,
her
dagger,
boots,
and
belt,
her
small
store
of
coins,
the
clothes
she
had
been
wearing...

And
Needle.

Though
her
duties
left
her
little
time
for
needlework,
she
practiced
when
she
could,
dueling
with
her
shadow
by
the
light
of
a
blue
candle.
One
night
the
waif
happened
to
be
passing
and
saw
Arya
at
her
swordplay.
The
girl
did
not
say
a
word,
but
the
next
day,
the
kindly
man
walked
Arya
back
to
her
cell.
“You
need
to
rid
yourself
of
all
this,”
he
said
of
her
treasures.

Arya
felt
stricken.
“They’re
mine.”

“And
who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

He
picked
up
her
silver
fork.
“This
belongs
to
Arya
of
House
Stark.
All
these
things
belong
to
her.
There
is
no
place
for
them
here.
There
is
no
place
for
her.
Hers
is
too
proud
a
name,
and
we
have
no
room
for
pride.
We
are
servants
here.”

“I
serve,”
she
said,
wounded.
She
liked
the
silver
fork.

“You
play
at
being
a
servant,
but
in
your
heart
you
are
a
lord’s
daughter.
You
have
taken
other
names,
but
you
wore
them
as
lightly
as
you
might
wear
a
gown.
Under
them
was
always
Arya.”

“I
don’t
wear
gowns.
You
can’t
fight
in
a
stupid
gown.”

“Why
would
you
wish
to
fight?
Are
you
some
bravo,
strutting
through
the
alleys,
spoiling
for
blood?”
He
sighed.
“Before
you
drink
from
the
cold
cup,
you
must
offer
up
all
you
are
to
Him
of
Many
Faces.
Your
body.
Your
soul.
Yourself.
If
you
cannot
bring
yourself
to
do
that,
you
must
leave
this
place.”

“The
iron
coin—”

“—has
paid
your
passage
here.
From
this
point
you
must
pay
your
own
way,
and
the
cost
is
dear.”

“I
don’t
have
any
gold.”

“What
we
offer
cannot
be
bought
with
gold.
The
cost
is
all
of
you.
Men
take
many
paths
through
this
vale
of
tears
and
pain.
Ours
is
the
hardest.
Few
are
made
to
walk
it.
It
takes
uncommon
strength
of
body
and
spirit,
and
a
heart
both
hard
and
strong.”

I
have
a
hole
where
my
heart
should
be,
she
thought,
and
nowhere
else
to
go.
“I’m
strong.
As
strong
as
you.
I’m
hard.”

“You
believe
this
is
the
only
place
for
you.”
It
was
as
if
he’d
heard
her
thoughts.
“You
are
wrong
in
that.
You
would
find
softer
service
in
the
household
of
some
merchant.
Or
would
you
sooner
be
a
courtesan,
and
have
songs
sung
of
your
beauty?
Speak
the
word,
and
we
will
send
you
to
the
Black
Pearl
or
the
Daughter
of
the
Dusk.
You
will
sleep
on
rose
petals
and
wear
silken
skirts
that
rustle
when
you
walk,
and
great
lords
will
beggar
themselves
for
your
maiden’s
blood.
Or
if
it
is
marriage
and
children
you
desire,
tell
me,
and
we
shall
find
a
husband
for
you.
Some
honest
apprentice
boy,
a
rich
old
man,
a
seafarer,
whatever
you
desire.”

She
wanted
none
of
that.
Wordless,
she
shook
her
head.

“Is
it
Westeros
you
dream
of,
child?
Luco
Prestayn’s
Lady
Bright
leaves
upon
the
morrow,
for
Gulltown,
Duskendale,
King’s
Landing,
and
Tyrosh.
Shall
we
find
you
passage
on
her?”

“I
only
just
came
from
Westeros.”
Sometimes
it
seemed
a
thousand
years
since
she
had
fled
King’s
Landing,
and
sometimes
it
seemed
like
only
yesterday,
but
she
knew
she
could
not
go
back.
“I’ll
go
if
you
don’t
want
me,
but
I
won’t
go
there.”

“My
wants
do
not
matter,”
said
the
kindly
man.
“It
may
be
that
the
Many-Faced
God
has
led
you
here
to
be
His
instrument,
but
when
I
look
at
you
I
see
a
child...
and
worse,
a
girl
child.
Many
have
served
Him
of
Many
Faces
through
the
centuries,
but
only
a
few
of
His
servants
have
been
women.
Women
bring
life
into
the
world.
We
bring
the
gift
of
death.
No
one
can
do
both.”

He
is
trying
to
scare
me
away,
Arya
thought,
the
way
he
did
with
the
worm.
“I
don’t
care
about
that.”

“You
should.
Stay,
and
the
Many-Faced
God
will
take
your
ears,
your
nose,
your
tongue.
He
will
take
your
sad
grey
eyes
that
have
seen
so
much.
He
will
take
your
hands,
your
feet,
your
arms
and
legs,
your
private
parts.
He
will
take
your
hopes
and
dreams,
your
loves
and
hates.
Those
who
enter
His
service
must
give
up
all
that
makes
them
who
they
are.
Can
you
do
that?”
He
cupped
her
chin
and
gazed
deep
into
her
eyes,
so
deep
it
made
her
shiver.
“No,”
he
said,
“I
do
not
think
you
can.”

Arya
knocked
his
hand
away.
“I
could
if
I
wanted
to.”

“So
says
Arya
of
House
Stark,
eater
of
grave
worms.”

“I
can
give
up
anything
I
want!”

He
gestured
at
her
treasures.
“Then
start
with
these.”

That
night
after
supper,
Arya
went
back
to
her
cell
and
took
off
her
robe
and
whispered
her
names,
but
sleep
refused
to
take
her.
She
tossed
on
her
mattress
stuffed
with
rags,
gnawing
on
her
lip.
She
could
feel
the
hole
inside
her
where
her
heart
had
been.

In
the
black
of
night
she
rose
again,
donned
the
clothes
she’d
worn
from
Westeros,
and
buckled
on
her
swordbelt.
Needle
hung
from
one
hip,
her
dagger
from
the
other.
With
her
floppy
hat
on
her
head,
her
fingerless
gloves
tucked
into
her
belt,
and
her
silver
fork
in
one
hand,
she
went
stealing
up
the
steps.
There
is
no
place
here
for
Arya
of
House
Stark,
she
was
thinking.
Arya’s
place
was
Winterfell,
only
Winterfell
was
gone.
When
the
snows
fall
and
the
white
winds
blow,
the
lone
wolf
dies,
but
the
pack
survives.
She
had
no
pack,
though.
They
had
killed
her
pack,
Ser
Ilyn
and
Ser
Meryn
and
the
queen,
and
when
she
tried
to
make
a
new
one
all
of
them
ran
off,
Hot
Pie
and
Gendry
and
Yoren
and
Lommy
Greenhands,
even
Harwin,
who
had
been
her
father’s
man.
She
shoved
through
the
doors,
out
into
the
night.

It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
outside
since
entering
the
temple.
The
sky
was
overcast,
and
fog
covered
the
ground
like
a
frayed
grey
blanket.
Off
to
her
right
she
heard
paddling
from
the
canal.
Braavos,
the
Secret
City,
she
thought.
The
name
seemed
very
apt.
She
crept
down
the
steep
steps
to
the
covered
dock,
the
mists
swirling
round
her
feet.
It
was
so
foggy
she
could
not
see
the
water,
but
she
heard
it
lapping
softly
at
stone
pilings.
In
the
distance,
a
light
glowed
through
the
gloom:
the
nightfire
at
the
temple
of
the
red
priests,
she
thought.

At
the
water’s
edge
she
stopped,
the
silver
fork
in
hand.
It
was
real
silver,
solid
through
and
through.
It’s
not
my
fork.
It
was
Salty
that
he
gave
it
to.
She
tossed
it
underhand,
heard
the
soft
plop
as
it
sank
below
the
water.

Her
floppy
hat
went
next,
then
the
gloves.
They
were
Salty’s
too.
She
emptied
her
pouch
into
her
palm;
five
silver
stags,
nine
copper
stars,
some
pennies
and
halfpennies
and
groats.
She
scattered
them
across
the
water.
Next
her
boots.
They
made
the
loudest
splashes.
Her
dagger
followed,
the
one
she’d
gotten
off
the
archer
who
had
begged
the
Hound
for
mercy.
Her
swordbelt
went
into
the
canal.
Her
cloak,
tunic,
breeches,
smallclothes,
all
of
it.
All
but
Needle.

She
stood
on
the
end
of
the
dock,
pale
and
goosefleshed
and
shivering
in
the
fog.
In
her
hand,
Needle
seemed
to
whisper
to
her.
Stick
them
with
the
pointy
end,
it
said,
and,
don’t
tell
Sansa!
Mikken’s
mark
was
on
the
blade.
It’s
just
a
sword.
If
she
needed
a
sword,
there
were
a
hundred
under
the
temple.
Needle
was
too
small
to
be
a
proper
sword,
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
toy.
She’d
been
a
stupid
little
girl
when
Jon
had
it
made
for
her.
“It’s
just
a
sword,”
she
said,
aloud
this
time...

...but
it
wasn’t.

Needle
was
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
her
mother
and
her
father,
even
Sansa.
Needle
was
Winterfell’s
grey
walls,
and
the
laughter
of
its
people.
Needle
was
the
summer
snows,
Old
Nan’s
stories,
the
heart
tree
with
its
red
leaves
and
scary
face,
the
warm
earthy
smell
of
the
glass
gardens,
the
sound
of
the
north
wind
rattling
the
shutters
of
her
room.
Needle
was
Jon
Snow’s
smile.
He
used
to
mess
my
hair
and
call
me
“little
sister,”
she
remembered,
and
suddenly
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes.

Polliver
had
stolen
the
sword
from
her
when
the
Mountain’s
men
took
her
captive,
but
when
she
and
the
Hound
walked
into
the
inn
at
the
crossroads,
there
it
was.
The
gods
wanted
me
to
have
it.
Not
the
Seven,
nor
Him
of
Many
Faces,
but
her
father’s
gods,
the
old
gods
of
the
north.
The
Many-Faced
God
can
have
the
rest,
she
thought,
but
he
can’t
have
this.

She
padded
up
the
steps
as
naked
as
her
name
day,
clutching
Needle.
Halfway
up,
one
of
the
stones
rocked
beneath
her
feet.
Arya
knelt
and
dug
around
its
edges
with
her
fingers.
It
would
not
move
at
first,
but
she
persisted,
picking
at
the
crumbling
mortar
with
her
nails.
Finally,
the
stone
shifted.
She
grunted
and
got
both
hands
in
and
pulled.
A
crack
opened
before
her.

“You’ll
be
safe
here,”
she
told
Needle.
“No
one
will
know
where
you
are
but
me.”
She
pushed
the
sword
and
sheath
behind
the
step,
then
shoved
the
stone
back
into
place,
so
it
looked
like
all
the
other
stones.
As
she
climbed
back
to
the
temple,
she
counted
steps,
so
she
would
know
where
to
find
the
sword
again.
One
day
she
might
have
need
of
it.
“One
day,”
she
whispered
to
herself.

She
never
told
the
kindly
man
what
she
had
done,
yet
he
knew.
The
next
night
he
came
to
her
cell
after
supper.
“Child,”
he
said,
“come
sit
with
me.
I
have
a
tale
to
tell
you.”

“What
kind
of
tale?”
she
asked,
wary.

“The
tale
of
our
beginnings.
If
you
would
be
one
of
us,
you
had
best
know
who
we
are
and
how
we
came
to
be.
Men
may
whisper
of
the
Faceless
Men
of
Braavos,
but
we
are
older
than
the
Secret
City.
Before
the
Titan
rose,
before
the
Unmasking
of
Uthero,
before
the
Founding,
we
were.
We
have
flowered
in
Braavos
amongst
these
northern
fogs,
but
we
first
took
root
in
Valyria,
amongst
the
wretched
slaves
who
toiled
in
the
deep
mines
beneath
the
Fourteen
Flames
that
lit
the
Freehold’s
nights
of
old.
Most
mines
are
dank
and
chilly
places,
cut
from
cold
dead
stone,
but
the
Fourteen
Flames
were
living
mountains
with
veins
of
molten
rock
and
hearts
of
fire.
So
the
mines
of
old
Valyria
were
always
hot,
and
they
grew
hotter
as
the
shafts
were
driven
deeper,
ever
deeper.
The
slaves
toiled
in
an
oven.
The
rocks
around
them
were
too
hot
to
touch.
The
air
stank
of
brimstone
and
would
sear
their
lungs
as
they
breathed
it.
The
soles
of
their
feet
would
burn
and
blister,
even
through
the
thickest
sandals.
Sometimes,
when
they
broke
through
a
wall
in
search
of
gold,
they
would
find
steam
instead,
or
boiling
water,
or
molten
rock.
Certain
shafts
were
cut
so
low
that
the
slaves
could
not
stand
upright,
but
had
to
crawl
or
bend.
And
there
were
wyrms
in
that
red
darkness
too.”

“Earthworms?”
she
asked,
frowning.

“Firewyrms.
Some
say
they
are
akin
to
dragons,
for
wyrms
breathe
fire
too.
Instead
of
soaring
through
the
sky,
they
bore
through
stone
and
soil.
If
the
old
tales
can
be
believed,
there
were
wyrms
amongst
the
Fourteen
Flames
even
before
the
dragons
came.
The
young
ones
are
no
larger
than
that
skinny
arm
of
yours,
but
they
can
grow
to
monstrous
size
and
have
no
love
for
men.”

“Did
they
kill
the
slaves?”

“Burnt
and
blackened
corpses
were
oft
found
in
shafts
where
the
rocks
were
cracked
or
full
of
holes.
Yet
still
the
mines
drove
deeper.
Slaves
perished
by
the
score,
but
their
masters
did
not
care.
Red
gold
and
yellow
gold
and
silver
were
reckoned
to
be
more
precious
than
the
lives
of
slaves,
for
slaves
were
cheap
in
the
old
Freehold.
During
war,
the
Valyrians
took
them
by
the
thousands.
In
times
of
peace
they
bred
them,
though
only
the
worst
were
sent
down
to
die
in
the
red
darkness.”

“Didn’t
the
slaves
rise
up
and
fight?”

“Some
did,”
he
said.
“Revolts
were
common
in
the
mines,
but
few
accomplished
much.
The
dragonlords
of
the
old
Freehold
were
strong
in
sorcery,
and
lesser
men
defied
them
at
their
peril.
The
first
Faceless
Man
was
one
who
did.”

“Who
was
he?”
Arya
blurted,
before
she
stopped
to
think.

“No
one,”
he
answered.
“Some
say
he
was
a
slave
himself.
Others
insist
he
was
a
freeholder’s
son,
born
of
noble
stock.
Some
will
even
tell
you
he
was
an
overseer
who
took
pity
on
his
charges.
The
truth
is,
no
one
knows.
Whoever
he
was,
he
moved
amongst
the
slaves
and
would
hear
them
at
their
prayers.
Men
of
a
hundred
different
nations
labored
in
the
mines,
and
each
prayed
to
his
own
god
in
his
own
tongue,
yet
all
were
praying
for
the
same
thing.
It
was
release
they
asked
for,
an
end
to
pain.
A
small
thing,
and
simple.
Yet
their
gods
made
no
answer,
and
their
suffering
went
on.
Are
their
gods
all
deaf?
he
wondered...
until
a
realization
came
upon
him,
one
night
in
the
red
darkness.

“All
gods
have
their
instruments,
men
and
women
who
serve
them
and
help
to
work
their
will
on
earth.
The
slaves
were
not
crying
out
to
a
hundred
different
gods,
as
it
seemed,
but
to
one
god
with
a
hundred
different
faces...
and
he
was
that
god’s
instrument.
That
very
night
he
chose
the
most
wretched
of
the
slaves,
the
one
who
had
prayed
most
earnestly
for
release,
and
freed
him
from
his
bondage.
The
first
gift
had
been
given.”

Arya
drew
back
from
him.
“He
killed
the
slave?”
That
did
not
sound
right.
“He
should
have
killed
the
masters!”

“He
would
bring
the
gift
to
them
as
well...
but
that
is
a
tale
for
another
day,
one
best
shared
with
no
one.”
He
cocked
his
head.
“And
who
are
you,
child?”

“No
one.”

“A
lie.”

“How
do
you
know?
Is
it
magic?”

“A
man
does
not
need
to
be
a
wizard
to
know
truth
from
falsehood,
not
if
he
has
eyes.
You
need
only
learn
to
read
a
face.
Look
at
the
eyes.
The
mouth.
The
muscles
here,
at
the
corners
of
the
jaw,
and
here,
where
the
neck
joins
the
shoulders.”
He
touched
her
lightly
with
two
fingers.
“Some
liars
blink.
Some
stare.
Some
look
away.
Some
lick
their
lips.
Many
cover
their
mouths
just
before
they
tell
a
lie,
as
if
to
hide
their
deceit.
Other
signs
may
be
more
subtle,
but
they
are
always
there.
A
false
smile
and
a
true
one
may
look
alike,
but
they
are
as
different
as
dusk
from
dawn.
Can
you
tell
dusk
from
dawn?”

Arya
nodded,
though
she
was
not
certain
that
she
could.

“Then
you
can
learn
to
see
a
lie...
and
once
you
do,
no
secret
will
be
safe
from
you.”

“Teach
me.”
She
would
be
no
one
if
that
was
what
it
took.
No
one
had
no
holes
inside
her.

“She
will
teach
you,”
said
the
kindly
man
as
the
waif
appeared
outside
her
door.
“Starting
with
the
tongue
of
Braavos.
What
use
are
you
if
you
cannot
speak
or
understand?
And
you
shall
teach
her
your
own
tongue.
The
two
of
you
shall
learn
together,
each
from
the
other.
Will
you
do
this?”

“Yes,”
she
said,
and
from
that
moment
she
was
a
novice
in
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
Her
servant’s
garb
was
taken
away,
and
she
was
given
a
robe
to
wear,
a
robe
of
black
and
white
as
buttery
soft
as
the
old
red
blanket
she’d
once
had
at
Winterfell.
Beneath
it
she
wore
smallclothes
of
fine
white
linen,
and
a
black
undertunic
that
hung
down
past
her
knees.

Thereafter
she
and
the
waif
spent
their
time
together
touching
things
and
pointing,
as
each
tried
to
teach
the
other
a
few
words
of
her
own
tongue.
Simple
words
at
first,
cup
and
candle
and
shoe;
then
harder
words;
then
sentences.
Once
Syrio
Forel
used
to
make
Arya
stand
on
one
leg
until
she
was
trembling.
Later
he
sent
her
chasing
after
cats.
She
had
danced
the
water
dance
on
the
limbs
of
trees,
a
stick
sword
in
her
hand.
Those
things
had
all
been
hard,
but
this
was
harder.

Even
sewing
was
more
fun
than
tongues,
she
told
herself,
after
a
night
when
she
had
forgotten
half
the
words
she
thought
she
knew,
and
pronounced
the
other
half
so
badly
that
the
waif
had
laughed
at
her.
My
sentences
are
as
crooked
as
my
stitches
used
to
be.
If
the
girl
had
not
been
so
small
and
starved,
Arya
would
have
smashed
her
stupid
face.
Instead
she
gnawed
her
lip.
Too
stupid
to
learn
and
too
stupid
to
give
up.

The
Common
Tongue
came
to
the
waif
more
quickly.
One
day
at
supper
she
turned
to
Arya,
and
asked,
“Who
are
you?”

“No
one,”
Arya
answered,
in
Braavosi.

“You
lie,”
said
the
waif.
“You
must
lie
gooder.”

Arya
laughed.
“Gooder?
You
mean
better,
stupid.”

“Better
stupid.
I
will
show
you.”

The
next
day
they
began
the
lying
game,
asking
questions
of
one
another,
taking
turns.
Sometimes
they
would
answer
truly,
sometimes
they
would
lie.
The
questioner
had
to
try
and
tell
what
was
true
and
what
was
false.
The
waif
always
seemed
to
know.
Arya
had
to
guess.
Most
of
the
time
she
guessed
wrong.

“How
many
years
have
you?”
the
waif
asked
her
once,
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“Ten,”
said
Arya,
and
raised
ten
fingers.
She
thought
she
was
still
ten,
though
it
was
hard
to
know
for
certain.
The
Braavosi
counted
days
differently
than
they
did
in
Westeros.
For
all
she
knew
her
name
day
had
come
and
gone.

The
waif
nodded.
Arya
nodded
back,
and
in
her
best
Braavosi
said,
“How
many
years
have
you?”

The
waif
showed
ten
fingers.
Then
ten
again,
and
yet
again.
Then
six.
Her
face
remained
as
smooth
as
still
water.
She
can’t
be
six-and-thirty,
Arya
thought.
She’s
a
little
girl.
“You’re
lying,”
she
said.
The
waif
shook
her
head
and
showed
her
once
again:
ten
and
ten
and
ten
and
six.
She
said
the
words
for
six-and-thirty,
and
made
Arya
say
them
too.

The
next
day
she
told
the
kindly
man
what
the
waif
had
claimed.
“She
did
not
lie,”
the
priest
said,
chuckling.
“The
one
you
call
waif
is
a
woman
grown
who
has
spent
her
life
serving
Him
of
Many
Faces.
She
gave
Him
all
she
was,
all
she
ever
might
have
been,
all
the
lives
that
were
within
her.”

Arya
bit
her
lip.
“Will
I
be
like
her?”

“No,”
he
said,
“not
unless
you
wish
it.
It
is
the
poisons
that
have
made
her
as
you
see
her.”

Poisons.
She
understood
then.
Every
evening
after
prayer
the
waif
emptied
a
stone
flagon
into
the
waters
of
the
black
pool.

The
waif
and
kindly
man
were
not
the
only
servants
of
the
Many-Faced
God.
From
time
to
time
others
would
visit
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
The
fat
fellow
had
fierce
black
eyes,
a
hook
nose,
and
a
wide
mouth
full
of
yellow
teeth.
The
stern
face
never
smiled;
his
eyes
were
pale,
his
lips
full
and
dark.
The
handsome
man
had
a
beard
of
a
different
color
every
time
she
saw
him,
and
a
different
nose,
but
he
was
never
less
than
comely.
Those
three
came
most
often,
but
there
were
others:
the
squinter,
the
lordling,
the
starved
man.
One
time
the
fat
fellow
and
the
squinter
came
together.
Umma
sent
Arya
to
pour
for
them.
“When
you
are
not
pouring,
you
must
stand
as
still
as
if
you
had
been
carved
of
stone,”
the
kindly
man
told
her.
“Can
you
do
that?”

“Yes.”
Before
you
can
learn
to
move
you
must
learn
to
be
still,
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her
long
ago
at
King’s
Landing,
and
she
had.
She
had
served
as
Roose
Bolton’s
cupbearer
at
Harrenhal,
and
he
would
flay
you
if
you
spilled
his
wine.

“Good,”
the
kindly
man
said.
“It
would
be
best
if
you
were
blind
and
deaf
as
well.
You
may
hear
things,
but
you
must
let
them
pass
in
one
ear
and
out
the
other.
Do
not
listen.”

Arya
heard
much
and
more
that
night,
but
almost
all
of
it
was
in
the
tongue
of
Braavos,
and
she
hardly
understood
one
word
in
ten.
Still
as
stone,
she
told
herself.
The
hardest
part
was
struggling
not
to
yawn.
Before
the
night
was
done,
her
wits
were
wandering.
Standing
there
with
the
flagon
in
her
hands,
she
dreamed
she
was
a
wolf,
running
free
through
a
moonlit
forest
with
a
great
pack
howling
at
her
heels.

“Are
the
other
men
all
priests?”
she
asked
the
kindly
man
the
next
morning.
“Were
those
their
real
faces?”

“What
do
you
think,
child?”

She
thought
no.
“Is
Jaqen
H’ghar
a
priest
too?
Do
you
know
if
Jaqen
will
be
coming
back
to
Braavos?”

“Who?”
he
said,
all
innocence.

“Jaqen
H’ghar.
He
gave
me
the
iron
coin.”

“I
know
no
one
by
this
name,
child.”

“I
asked
him
how
he
changed
his
face,
and
he
said
it
was
no
harder
than
taking
a
new
name,
if
you
knew
the
way.”

“Did
he?”

“Will
you
show
me
how
to
change
my
face?”

“If
you
wish.”
He
cupped
her
chin
in
his
hand
and
turned
her
head.
“Puff
up
your
cheeks
and
stick
out
your
tongue.”

Arya
puffed
up
her
cheeks
and
stuck
out
her
tongue.

“There.
Your
face
is
changed.”

“That’s
not
how
I
meant.
Jaqen
used
magic.”

“All
sorcery
comes
at
a
cost,
child.
Years
of
prayer
and
sacrifice
and
study
are
required
to
work
a
proper
glamor.”

“Years?”
she
said,
dismayed.

“If
it
were
easy
all
men
would
do
it.
You
must
walk
before
you
run.
Why
use
a
spell,
where
mummer’s
tricks
will
serve?”

“I
don’t
know
any
mummer’s
tricks
either.”

“Then
practice
making
faces.
Beneath
your
skin
are
muscles.
Learn
to
use
them.
It
is
your
face.
Your
cheeks,
your
lips,
your
ears.
Smiles
and
scowls
should
not
come
upon
you
like
sudden
squalls.
A
smile
should
be
a
servant,
and
come
only
when
you
call
it.
Learn
to
rule
your
face.”

“Show
me
how.”

“Puff
up
your
cheeks.”
She
did.
“Lift
your
eyebrows.
No,
higher.”
She
did
that
too.
“Good.
See
how
long
you
can
hold
that.
It
will
not
be
long.
Try
it
again
on
the
morrow.
You
will
find
a
Myrish
mirror
in
the
vaults.
Train
before
it
for
an
hour
every
day.
Eyes,
nostrils,
cheeks,
ears,
lips,
learn
to
rule
them
all.”
He
cupped
her
chin.
“Who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

“A
lie.
A
sad
little
lie,
child.”

She
found
the
Myrish
mirror
the
next
day,
and
every
morn
and
every
night
she
sat
before
it
with
a
candle
on
each
side
of
her,
making
faces.
Rule
your
face,
she
told
herself,
and
you
can
lie.

Soon
thereafter
the
kindly
man
commanded
her
to
help
the
other
acolytes
prepare
the
corpses.
The
work
was
not
near
as
hard
as
scrubbing
steps
for
Weese.
Sometimes
if
the
corpse
was
big
or
fat
she
would
struggle
with
the
weight,
but
most
of
the
dead
were
old
dry
bones
in
wrinkled
skins.
Arya
would
look
at
them
as
she
washed
them,
wondering
what
brought
them
to
the
black
pool.
She
remembered
a
tale
she
had
heard
from
Old
Nan,
about
how
sometimes
during
a
long
winter
men
who’d
lived
beyond
their
years
would
announce
that
they
were
going
hunting.
And
their
daughters
would
weep
and
their
sons
would
turn
their
faces
to
the
fire,
she
could
hear
Old
Nan
saying,
but
no
one
would
stop
them,
or
ask
what
game
they
meant
to
hunt,
with
the
snows
so
deep
and
the
cold
wind
howling.
She
wondered
what
the
old
Braavosi
told
their
sons
and
daughters,
before
they
set
off
for
the
House
of
Black
and
White.

The
moon
turned
and
turned
again,
though
Arya
never
saw
it.
She
served,
washed
the
dead,
made
faces
at
the
mirrors,
learned
the
Braavosi
tongue,
and
tried
to
remember
that
she
was
no
one.

One
day
the
kindly
man
sent
for
her.
“Your
accent
is
a
horror,”
he
said,
“but
you
have
enough
words
to
make
your
wants
understood
after
a
fashion.
It
is
time
that
you
left
us
for
a
while.
The
only
way
you
will
ever
truly
master
our
tongue
is
if
you
speak
it
every
day
from
dawn
to
dusk.
You
must
go.”

“When?”
she
asked
him.
“Where?”

“Now,”
he
answered.
“Beyond
these
walls
you
will
find
the
hundred
isles
of
Braavos
in
the
sea.
You
have
been
taught
the
words
for
mussels,
cockles,
and
clams,
have
you
not?”

“Yes.”
She
repeated
them,
in
her
best
Braavosi.

Her
best
Braavosi
made
him
smile.
“It
will
serve.
Along
the
wharves
below
the
Drowned
Town
you
will
find
a
fishmonger
named
Brusco,
a
good
man
with
a
bad
back.
He
has
need
of
a
girl
to
push
his
barrow
and
sell
his
cockles,
clams,
and
mussels
to
the
sailors
off
the
ships.
You
shall
be
that
girl.
Do
you
understand?”

“Yes.”

“And
when
Brusco
asks,
who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

“No.
That
will
not
serve,
outside
this
House.”

She
hesitated.
“I
could
be
Salty,
from
Saltpans.”

“Salty
is
known
to
Ternesio
Terys
and
the
men
of
the
Titan’s
Daughter.
You
are
marked
by
the
way
you
speak,
so
you
must
be
some
girl
of
Westeros...
but
a
different
girl,
I
think.”

She
bit
her
lip.
“Could
I
be
Cat?”

“Cat.”
He
considered.
“Yes.
Braavos
is
full
of
cats.
One
more
will
not
be
noticed.
You
are
Cat,
an
orphan
of...”

“King’s
Landing.”
She
had
visited
White
Harbor
with
her
father
twice,
but
she
knew
King’s
Landing
better.

“Just
so.
Your
father
was
oarmaster
on
a
galley.
When
your
mother
died,
he
took
you
off
to
sea
with
him.
Then
he
died
as
well,
and
his
captain
had
no
use
for
you,
so
he
put
you
off
the
ship
in
Braavos.
And
what
was
the
name
of
the
ship?”

“Nymeria,”
she
said
at
once.

That
night
she
left
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
A
long
iron
knife
rode
on
her
right
hip,
hidden
by
her
cloak,
a
patched
and
faded
thing
of
the
sort
an
orphan
might
wear.
Her
shoes
pinched
her
toes
and
her
tunic
was
so
threadbare
that
the
wind
cut
right
through
it.
But
Braavos
lay
before
her.
The
night
air
smelled
of
smoke
and
salt
and
fish.
The
canals
were
crooked,
the
alleys
crookeder.
Men
gave
her
curious
looks
as
she
went
past,
and
beggar
children
called
out
words
she
could
not
understand.
Before
long
she
was
completely
lost.

“Ser
Gregor,”
she
chanted,
as
she
crossed
a
stone
bridge
supported
by
four
arches.
From
the
center
of
its
span
she
could
see
the
masts
of
ships
in
the
Ragman’s
Harbor.
“Dunsen,
Raff
the
Sweetling,
Ser
Ilyn,
Ser
Meryn,
Queen
Cersei.”
Rain
began
to
fall.
Arya
turned
her
face
up
to
let
the
raindrops
wash
her
cheeks,
so
happy
she
could
dance.
“Valar
morghulis,”
she
said,
“valar
morghulis,
valar
morghulis.”





ALAYNE

As
the
rising
sun
came
streaming
through
the
windows,
Alayne
sat
up
in
bed
and
stretched.
Gretchel
heard
her
stir
and
rose
at
once
to
fetch
her
bedrobe.
The
rooms
had
grown
chilly
during
the
night.
It
will
be
worse
when
winter
has
us
in
its
grip,
she
thought.
Winter
will
make
this
place
as
cold
as
any
tomb.
Alayne
slipped
into
the
robe
and
belted
it
about
her
waist.
“The
fire’s
almost
out,”
she
observed.
“Put
another
log
on,
if
you
would.”

“As
my
lady
wishes,”
the
old
woman
said.

Alayne’s
apartments
in
the
Maiden’s
Tower
were
larger
and
more
lavish
than
the
little
bedchamber
where
she’d
been
kept
when
Lady
Lysa
was
alive.
She
had
a
dressing
room
and
a
privy
of
her
own
now,
and
a
balcony
of
carved
white
stone
that
looked
off
across
the
Vale.
While
Gretchel
was
tending
to
the
fire,
Alayne
padded
barefoot
across
the
room
and
slipped
outside.
The
stone
was
cold
beneath
her
feet,
and
the
wind
was
blowing
fiercely,
as
it
always
did
up
here,
but
the
view
made
her
forget
all
that
for
half
a
heartbeat.
Maiden’s
was
the
easternmost
of
the
Eyrie’s
seven
slender
towers,
so
she
had
the
Vale
before
her,
its
forests
and
rivers
and
fields
all
hazy
in
the
morning
light.
The
way
the
sun
was
hitting
the
mountains
made
them
look
like
solid
gold.

So
lovely.
The
snow-clad
summit
of
the
Giant’s
Lance
loomed
above
her,
an
immensity
of
stone
and
ice
that
dwarfed
the
castle
perched
upon
its
shoulder.
Icicles
twenty
feet
long
draped
the
lip
of
the
precipice
where
Alyssa’s
Tears
fell
in
summer.
A
falcon
soared
above
the
frozen
waterfall,
blue
wings
spread
wide
against
the
morning
sky.
Would
that
I
had
wings
as
well.

She
rested
her
hands
on
the
carved
stone
balustrade
and
made
herself
peer
over
the
edge.
She
could
see
Sky
six
hundred
feet
below,
and
the
stone
steps
carved
into
the
mountain,
the
winding
way
that
led
past
Snow
and
Stone
all
the
way
down
to
the
valley
floor.
She
could
see
the
towers
and
keeps
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon,
as
small
as
a
child’s
toys.
Around
the
walls
the
hosts
of
Lords
Declarant
were
stirring,
emerging
from
their
tents
like
ants
from
an
anthill.
If
only
they
were
truly
ants,
she
thought,
we
could
step
on
them
and
crush
them.

Young
Lord
Hunter
and
his
levies
had
joined
the
others
two
days
past.
Nestor
Royce
had
closed
the
Gates
against
them,
but
he
had
fewer
than
three
hundred
men
in
his
garrison.
Each
of
the
Lords
Declarant
had
brought
a
thousand,
and
there
were
six
of
them.
Alayne
knew
their
names
as
well
as
her
own.
Benedar
Belmore,
Lord
of
Strongsong.
Symond
Templeton,
the
Knight
of
Ninestars.
Horton
Redfort,
Lord
of
Redfort.
Anya
Waynwood,
Lady
of
Ironoaks.
Gilwood
Hunter,
called
Young
Lord
Hunter
by
all
and
sundry,
Lord
of
Longbow
Hall.
And
Yohn
Royce,
mightiest
of
them
all,
the
redoubtable
Bronze
Yohn,
Lord
of
Runestone,
Nestor’s
cousin
and
the
chief
of
the
senior
branch
of
House
Royce.
The
six
had
gathered
at
Runestone
after
Lysa
Arryn’s
fall,
and
there
made
a
pact
together,
vowing
to
defend
Lord
Robert,
the
Vale,
and
one
another.
Their
declaration
made
no
mention
of
the
Lord
Protector,
but
spoke
of
“misrule”
that
must
be
ended,
and
of
“false
friends
and
evil
counselors”
as
well.

A
cold
gust
of
wind
blew
up
her
legs.
She
went
inside
to
choose
a
gown
to
break
her
fast
in.
Petyr
had
given
her
his
late
wife’s
wardrobe,
a
wealth
of
silks,
satins,
velvets,
and
furs
far
beyond
anything
she
had
ever
dreamed,
though
the
great
bulk
of
it
was
far
too
large
for
her;
Lady
Lysa
had
grown
very
stout
during
her
long
succession
of
pregnancies,
stillbirths,
and
miscarriages.
A
few
of
the
oldest
gowns
had
been
made
for
young
Lysa
Tully
of
Riverrun,
however,
and
others
Gretchel
had
been
able
to
alter
to
fit
Alayne,
who
was
almost
as
long
of
leg
at
three-and-ten
as
her
aunt
had
been
at
twenty.

This
morning
her
eye
was
caught
by
a
parti-colored
gown
of
Tully
red
and
blue,
lined
with
vair.
Gretchel
helped
her
slide
her
arms
into
the
belled
sleeves
and
laced
her
back,
then
brushed
and
pinned
her
hair.
Alayne
had
darkened
it
again
last
night
before
she
went
to
bed.
The
wash
her
aunt
had
given
her
changed
her
own
rich
auburn
into
Alayne’s
burnt
brown,
but
it
was
seldom
long
before
the
red
began
creeping
back
at
the
roots.
And
what
must
I
do
when
the
dye
runs
out?
The
wash
had
come
from
Tyrosh,
across
the
narrow
sea.

As
she
went
down
to
break
her
fast,
Alayne
was
struck
again
by
the
stillness
of
the
Eyrie.
There
was
no
quieter
castle
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
The
servants
here
were
few
and
old
and
kept
their
voices
down
so
as
not
to
excite
the
young
lord.
There
were
no
horses
on
the
mountain,
no
hounds
to
bark
and
growl,
no
knights
training
in
the
yard.
Even
the
footsteps
of
the
guards
seemed
strangely
muffled
as
they
walked
the
pale
stone
halls.
She
could
hear
the
wind
moaning
and
sighing
round
the
towers,
but
that
was
all.
When
she
had
first
come
to
Eyrie,
there
had
been
the
murmur
of
Alyssa’s
Tears
as
well,
but
the
waterfall
was
frozen
now.
Gretchel
said
it
would
stay
silent
till
the
spring.

She
found
Lord
Robert
alone
in
the
Morning
Hall
above
the
kitchens,
pushing
a
wooden
spoon
listlessly
through
a
big
bowl
of
porridge
and
honey.
“I
wanted
eggs,”
he
complained
when
he
saw
her.
“I
wanted
three
eggs
boiled
soft,
and
some
back
bacon.”

They
had
no
eggs,
no
more
than
they
had
bacon.
The
Eyrie’s
granaries
held
sufficient
oats
and
corn
and
barley
to
feed
them
for
a
year,
but
they
depended
on
a
bastard
girl
named
Mya
Stone
to
bring
fresh
foodstuffs
up
from
the
valley
floor.
With
the
Lords
Declarant
encamped
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
was
no
way
for
Mya
to
get
through.
Lord
Belmore,
first
of
the
six
to
reach
the
Gates,
had
sent
a
raven
to
tell
Littlefinger
that
no
more
food
would
go
up
to
the
Eyrie
until
he
sent
Lord
Robert
down.
It
was
not
quite
a
siege,
not
as
yet,
but
it
was
the
next
best
thing.

“You
can
have
eggs
when
Mya
comes,
as
many
as
you
like,”
Alayne
promised
the
little
lordling.
“She’ll
bring
eggs
and
butter
and
melons,
all
sorts
of
tasty
things.”

The
boy
was
unappeased.
“I
wanted
eggs
today.”

“Sweetrobin,
there
are
no
eggs,
you
know
that.
Please,
eat
your
porridge,
it’s
very
nice.”
She
ate
a
spoonful
of
her
own.

Robert
pushed
his
spoon
across
the
bowl
and
back,
but
never
brought
it
to
his
lips.
“I
am
not
hungry,”
he
decided.
“I
want
to
go
back
to
bed.
I
never
slept
last
night.
I
heard
singing.
Maester
Colemon
gave
me
dreamwine
but
I
could
still
hear
it.”

Alayne
put
down
her
spoon.
“If
there
had
been
singing,
I
should
have
heard
it
too.
You
had
a
bad
dream,
that’s
all.”

“No,
it
wasn’t
a
dream.”
Tears
filled
his
eyes.
“Marillion
was
singing
again.
Your
father
says
he’s
dead,
but
he
isn’t.”

“He
is.”
It
frightened
her
to
hear
him
talk
like
this.
Bad
enough
that
he
is
small
and
sickly,
what
if
he
is
mad
as
well?
“Sweetrobin,
he
is.
Marillion
loved
your
lady
mother
too
much
and
could
not
live
with
what
he’d
done
to
her,
so
he
walked
into
the
sky.”
Alayne
had
not
seen
the
body,
no
more
than
Robert
had,
but
she
did
not
doubt
the
fact
of
the
singer’s
death.
“He’s
gone,
truly.”

“But
I
hear
him
every
night.
Even
when
I
close
the
shutters
and
put
a
pillow
on
my
head.
Your
father
should
have
cut
his
tongue
out.
I
told
him
to,
but
he
wouldn’t.”

He
needed
a
tongue
to
confess.
“Be
a
good
boy
and
eat
your
porridge,”
Alayne
pleaded.
“Please?
For
me?”

“I
don’t
want
porridge.”
Robert
flung
his
spoon
across
the
hall.
It
bounced
off
a
hanging
tapestry,
and
left
a
smear
of
porridge
upon
a
white
silk
moon.
“The
lord
wants
eggs!”

“The
lord
shall
eat
porridge
and
be
thankful
for
it,”
said
Petyr’s
voice,
behind
them.

Alayne
turned,
and
saw
him
in
the
doorway
arch
with
Maester
Colemon
at
his
side.
“You
should
heed
the
Lord
Protector,
my
lord,”
the
maester
said.
“Your
lord’s
bannermen
are
coming
up
the
mountain
to
pay
you
homage,
so
you
will
need
all
your
strength.”

Robert
rubbed
at
his
left
eye
with
a
knuckle.
“Send
them
away.
I
don’t
want
them.
If
they
come,
I’ll
make
them
fly.”

“You
tempt
me
sorely,
my
lord,
but
I
fear
I
promised
them
safe
conduct,”
said
Petyr.
“In
any
case,
it
is
too
late
to
turn
them
back.
By
now
they
may
have
climbed
as
far
as
Stone.”

“Why
won’t
they
leave
us
be?”
wailed
Alayne.
“We
never
did
them
any
harm.
What
do
they
want
of
us?”

“Just
Lord
Robert.
Him,
and
the
Vale.”
Petyr
smiled.
“There
will
be
eight
of
them.
Lord
Nestor
is
showing
them
up,
and
they
have
Lyn
Corbray
with
them.
Ser
Lyn
is
not
the
sort
of
man
to
stay
away
when
blood
is
in
the
offing.”

His
words
did
little
to
soothe
her
fears.
Lyn
Corbray
had
slain
almost
as
many
men
in
duels
as
he
had
in
battle.
He
had
won
his
spurs
during
Robert’s
Rebellion,
she
knew,
fighting
first
against
Lord
Jon
Arryn
at
the
gates
of
Gulltown,
and
later
beneath
his
banners
on
the
Trident,
where
he
had
cut
down
Prince
Lewyn
of
Dorne,
a
white
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
Petyr
said
that
Prince
Lewyn
had
been
sorely
wounded
by
the
time
the
tide
of
battle
swept
him
to
his
final
dance
with
Lady
Forlorn,
but
added,
“That’s
not
a
point
you’ll
want
to
raise
with
Corbray,
though.
Those
who
do
are
soon
given
the
chance
to
ask
Martell
himself
the
truth
of
it,
down
in
the
halls
of
hell.”
If
even
half
of
what
she
had
heard
from
Lord
Robert’s
guards
was
true,
Lyn
Corbray
was
more
dangerous
than
all
six
of
the
Lords
Declarant
put
together.
“Why
is
he
coming?”
she
asked.
“I
thought
the
Corbrays
were
for
you.”

“Lord
Lyonel
Corbray
is
well
disposed
toward
my
rule,”
said
Petyr,
“but
his
brother
goes
his
own
way.
On
the
Trident,
when
their
father
fell
wounded,
it
was
Lyn
who
snatched
up
Lady
Forlorn
and
slew
the
man
who’d
cut
him
down.
Whilst
Lyonel
was
carrying
the
old
man
back
to
the
maesters
in
the
rear,
Lyn
led
his
charge
against
the
Dornishmen
threatening
Robert’s
left,
broke
their
lines
to
pieces,
and
slew
Lewyn
Martell.
So
when
old
Lord
Corbray
died,
he
bestowed
the
Lady
upon
his
younger
son.
Lyonel
got
his
lands,
his
title,
his
castle,
and
all
his
coin,
yet
still
feels
he
was
cheated
of
his
birthright,
whilst
Ser
Lyn...
well,
he
loves
Lyonel
as
much
as
he
loves
me.
He
wanted
Lysa’s
hand
for
himself.”

“I
don’t
like
Ser
Lyn,”
Robert
insisted.
“I
won’t
have
him
here.
You
send
him
back
down.
I
never
said
that
he
could
come.
Not
here.
The
Eyrie
is
impregnable,
Mother
said.”

“Your
mother
is
dead,
my
lord.
Until
your
sixteenth
name
day,
I
rule
the
Eyrie.”
Petyr
turned
to
the
stoop-backed
serving
woman
hovering
near
the
kitchen
steps.
“Mela,
fetch
his
lordship
a
new
spoon.
He
wants
to
eat
his
porridge.”

“I
do
not!
Let
my
porridge
fly!”
This
time
Robert
flung
the
bowl,
porridge
and
honey
and
all.
Petyr
Baelish
ducked
aside
nimbly,
but
Maester
Colemon
was
not
so
quick.
The
wooden
bowl
caught
him
square
in
the
chest,
and
its
contents
exploded
upward
over
his
face
and
shoulders.
He
yelped
in
a
most
unmaesterlike
fashion,
while
Alayne
turned
to
soothe
the
little
lordling,
but
too
late.
The
fit
was
on
him.
A
pitcher
of
milk
went
flying
as
his
hand
caught
it,
flailing.
When
he
tried
to
rise
he
knocked
his
chair
backwards
and
fell
on
top
of
it.
One
foot
caught
Alayne
in
the
belly,
so
hard
it
knocked
the
wind
from
her.
“Oh,
gods
be
good,”
she
heard
Petyr
say,
disgusted.

Globs
of
porridge
dotted
Maester
Colemon’s
face
and
hair
as
he
knelt
over
his
charge,
murmuring
soothing
words.
One
gobbet
crept
slowly
down
his
right
cheek,
like
a
lumpy
grey-brown
tear.
It
is
not
so
bad
a
spell
as
the
last
one,
Alayne
thought,
trying
to
be
hopeful.
By
the
time
the
shaking
stopped,
two
guards
in
sky-blue
cloaks
and
silvery
mail
shirts
had
come
at
Petyr’s
summons.
“Take
him
back
to
bed
and
leech
him,”
the
Lord
Protector
said,
and
the
taller
guardsman
scooped
the
boy
up
in
his
arms.
I
could
carry
him
myself,
Alayne
thought.
He
is
no
heavier
than
a
doll.

Colemon
lingered
a
moment
before
following.
“My
lord,
this
parley
might
best
be
left
for
another
day.
His
lordship’s
spells
have
grown
worse
since
Lady
Lysa’s
death.
More
frequent
and
more
violent.
I
bleed
the
child
as
often
as
I
dare,
and
mix
him
dreamwine
and
milk
of
the
poppy
to
help
him
sleep,
but...”

“He
sleeps
twelve
hours
a
day,”
Petyr
said.
“I
require
him
awake
from
time
to
time.”

The
maester
combed
his
fingers
through
his
hair,
dribbling
globs
of
porridge
on
the
floor.
“Lady
Lysa
would
give
his
lordship
her
breast
whenever
he
grew
overwrought.
Archmaester
Ebrose
claims
that
mother’s
milk
has
many
heathful
properties.”

“Is
that
your
counsel,
maester?
That
we
find
a
wet
nurse
for
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale?
When
shall
we
wean
him,
on
his
wedding
day?
That
way
he
can
move
directly
from
his
nurse’s
nipples
to
his
wife’s.”
Lord
Petyr’s
laugh
made
it
plain
what
he
thought
of
that.
“No,
I
think
not.
I
suggest
you
find
another
way.
The
boy
is
fond
of
sweets,
is
he
not?”

“Sweets?”
said
Colemon.

“Sweets.
Cakes
and
pies,
jams
and
jellies,
honey
on
the
comb.
Perhaps
a
pinch
of
sweetsleep
in
his
milk,
have
you
tried
that?
Just
a
pinch,
to
calm
him
and
stop
his
wretched
shaking.”

“A
pinch?”
The
apple
in
the
maester’s
throat
moved
up
and
down
as
he
swallowed.
“One
small
pinch...
perhaps,
perhaps.
Not
too
much,
and
not
too
often,
yes,
I
might
try...”

“A
pinch,”
Lord
Petyr
said,
“before
you
bring
him
forth
to
meet
the
lords.”

“As
you
command,
my
lord.”
The
maester
hurried
out,
his
chain
clinking
softly
with
every
step.

“Father,”
Alayne
asked
when
he
was
gone,
“will
you
have
a
bowl
of
porridge
to
break
your
fast?”

“I
despise
porridge.”
He
looked
at
her
with
Littlefinger’s
eyes.
“I’d
sooner
break
my
fast
with
a
kiss.”

A
true
daughter
would
not
refuse
her
sire
a
kiss,
so
Alayne
went
to
him
and
kissed
him,
a
quick
dry
peck
upon
the
cheek,
and
just
as
quickly
stepped
away.

“How...
dutiful.”
Littlefinger
smiled
with
his
mouth,
but
not
his
eyes.
“Well,
I
have
other
duties
for
you,
as
it
happens.
Tell
the
cook
to
mull
some
red
wine
with
honey
and
raisins.
Our
guests
will
be
cold
and
thirsty
after
their
long
climb.
You
are
to
meet
them
when
they
arrive,
and
offer
them
refreshment.
Wine,
bread,
and
cheese.
What
sort
of
cheese
is
left
to
us?”

“The
sharp
white
and
the
stinky
blue.”

“The
white.
And
you’d
best
change
as
well.”

Alayne
looked
down
at
her
dress,
the
deep
blue
and
rich
dark
red
of
Riverrun.
“Is
it
too—”

“It
is
too
Tully.
The
Lords
Declarant
will
not
be
pleased
by
the
sight
of
my
bastard
daughter
prancing
about
in
my
dead
wife’s
clothes.
Choose
something
else.
Need
I
remind
you
to
avoid
sky
blue
and
cream?”

“No.”
Sky
blue
and
cream
were
the
colors
of
House
Arryn.
“Eight,
you
said...
Bronze
Yohn
is
one
of
them?”

“The
only
one
who
matters.”

“Bronze
Yohn
knows
me,”
she
reminded
him.
“He
was
a
guest
at
Winterfell
when
his
son
rode
north
to
take
the
black.”
She
had
fallen
wildly
in
love
with
Ser
Waymar,
she
remembered
dimly,
but
that
was
a
lifetime
ago,
when
she
was
a
stupid
little
girl.
“And
that
was
not
the
only
time.
Lord
Royce
saw...
he
saw
Sansa
Stark
again
at
King’s
Landing,
during
the
Hand’s
tourney.”

Petyr
put
a
finger
under
her
chin.
“That
Royce
glimpsed
this
pretty
face
I
do
not
doubt,
but
it
was
one
face
in
a
thousand.
A
man
fighting
in
a
tourney
has
more
to
concern
him
than
some
child
in
the
crowd.
And
at
Winterfell,
Sansa
was
a
little
girl
with
auburn
hair.
My
daughter
is
a
maiden
tall
and
fair,
and
her
hair
is
chestnut.
Men
see
what
they
expect
to
see,
Alayne.”
He
kissed
her
nose.
“Have
Maddy
lay
a
fire
in
the
solar.
I
shall
receive
our
Lords
Declarant
there.”

“Not
the
High
Hall?”

“No.
Gods
forbid
they
glimpse
me
near
the
high
seat
of
the
Arryns,
they
might
think
that
I
mean
to
sit
in
it.
Cheeks
born
so
low
as
mine
must
never
aspire
to
such
lofty
cushions.”

“The
solar.”
She
should
have
stopped
with
that,
but
the
words
came
tumbling
out
of
her.
“If
you
gave
them
Robert...”

“...and
the
Vale?”

“They
have
the
Vale.”

“Oh,
much
of
it,
that’s
true.
Not
all,
however.
I
am
well
loved
in
Gulltown,
and
have
some
lordly
friends
of
mine
own
as
well.
Grafton,
Lynderly,
Lyonel
Corbray...
though
I’ll
grant
you,
they
are
no
match
for
the
Lords
Declarant.
Still,
where
would
you
have
us
go,
Alayne?
Back
to
my
mighty
stronghold
on
the
Fingers?”

She
had
thought
about
that.
“Joffrey
gave
you
Harrenhal.
You
are
lord
in
your
own
right
there.”

“By
title.
I
needed
a
great
seat
to
marry
Lysa,
and
the
Lannisters
were
not
about
to
grant
me
Casterly
Rock.”

“Yes,
but
the
castle
is
yours.”

“Ah,
and
what
a
castle
it
is.
Cavernous
halls
and
ruined
towers,
ghosts
and
draughts,
ruinous
to
heat,
impossible
to
garrison...
and
there’s
that
small
matter
of
a
curse.”

“Curses
are
only
in
songs
and
stories.”

That
seemed
to
amuse
him.
“Has
someone
made
a
song
about
Gregor
Clegane
dying
of
a
poisoned
spear
thrust?
Or
about
the
sellsword
before
him,
whose
limbs
Ser
Gregor
removed
a
joint
at
a
time?
That
one
took
the
castle
from
Ser
Amory
Lorch,
who
received
it
from
Lord
Tywin.
A
bear
killed
one,
your
dwarf
the
other.
Lady
Whent’s
died
as
well,
I
hear.
Lothstons,
Strongs,
Harroways,
Strongs...
Harrenhal
has
withered
every
hand
to
touch
it.”

“Then
give
it
to
Lord
Frey.”

Petyr
laughed.
“Perhaps
I
shall.
Or
better
still,
to
our
sweet
Cersei.
Though
I
should
not
speak
harshly
of
her,
she
is
sending
me
some
splendid
tapestries.
Isn’t
that
kind
of
her?”

The
mention
of
the
queen’s
name
made
her
stiffen.
“She’s
not
kind.
She
scares
me.
If
she
should
learn
where
I
am—”

“—I
might
have
to
remove
her
from
the
game
sooner
than
I’d
planned.
Provided
she
does
not
remove
herself
first.”
Petyr
teased
her
with
a
little
smile.
“In
the
game
of
thrones,
even
the
humblest
pieces
can
have
wills
of
their
own.
Sometimes
they
refuse
to
make
the
moves
you’ve
planned
for
them.
Mark
that
well,
Alayne.
It’s
a
lesson
that
Cersei
Lannister
still
has
yet
to
learn.
Now,
don’t
you
have
some
duties
to
perform?”

She
did
indeed.
She
saw
to
the
mulling
of
the
wine
first,
found
a
suitable
wheel
of
sharp
white
cheese,
and
commanded
the
cook
to
bake
bread
enough
for
twenty,
in
case
the
Lords
Declarant
brought
more
men
than
expected.
Once
they
eat
our
bread
and
salt
they
are
our
guests
and
cannot
harm
us.
The
Freys
had
broken
all
the
laws
of
hospitality
when
they’d
murdered
her
lady
mother
and
her
brother
at
the
Twins,
but
she
could
not
believe
that
a
lord
as
noble
as
Yohn
Royce
would
ever
stoop
to
do
the
same.

The
solar
next.
Its
floor
was
covered
by
a
Myrish
carpet,
so
there
was
no
need
to
lay
down
rushes.
Alayne
asked
two
serving
men
to
erect
the
trestle
table
and
bring
up
eight
of
the
heavy
oak-and-leather
chairs.
For
a
feast
she
would
have
placed
one
at
the
head
of
the
table,
one
at
the
foot,
and
three
along
each
side,
but
this
was
no
feast.
She
had
the
men
arrange
six
chairs
on
one
side
of
the
table,
two
on
the
other.
By
now
the
Lords
Declarant
might
have
climbed
as
far
as
Snow.
It
took
most
of
a
day
to
make
the
climb,
even
on
muleback.
Afoot,
most
men
took
several
days.

It
might
be
that
the
lords
would
talk
late
into
the
night.
They
would
need
fresh
candles.
After
Maddy
laid
the
fire,
she
sent
her
down
to
find
the
scented
beeswax
candles
Lord
Waxley
had
given
Lady
Lysa
when
he
sought
to
win
her
hand.
Then
she
visited
the
kitchens
once
again,
to
make
certain
of
the
wine
and
bread.
All
seemed
well
in
hand,
and
there
was
still
time
enough
for
her
to
bathe
and
wash
her
hair
and
change.

There
was
a
gown
of
purple
silk
that
gave
her
pause,
and
another
of
dark
blue
velvet
slashed
with
silver
that
would
have
woken
all
the
color
in
her
eyes,
but
in
the
end
she
remembered
that
Alayne
was
after
all
a
bastard,
and
must
not
presume
to
dress
above
her
station.
The
dress
she
picked
was
lambswool,
dark
brown
and
simply
cut,
with
leaves
and
vines
embroidered
around
the
bodice,
sleeves,
and
hem
in
golden
thread.
It
was
modest
and
becoming,
though
scarce
richer
than
something
a
serving
girl
might
wear.
Petyr
had
given
her
all
of
Lady
Lysa’s
jewels
as
well,
and
she
tried
on
several
necklaces,
but
they
all
seemed
ostentatious.
In
the
end
she
chose
a
simple
velvet
ribbon
in
autumn
gold.
When
Gretchel
fetched
her
Lysa’s
silvered
looking
glass,
the
color
seemed
just
perfect
with
Alayne’s
mass
of
dark
brown
hair.
Lord
Royce
will
never
know
me,
she
thought.
Why,
I
hardly
know
myself.

Feeling
near
as
bold
as
Petyr
Baelish,
Alayne
Stone
donned
her
smile
and
went
down
to
meet
their
guests.

The
Eyrie
was
the
only
castle
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
where
the
main
entrance
was
underneath
the
dungeons.
Steep
stone
steps
crept
up
the
mountainside
past
the
waycastles
Stone
and
Snow,
but
they
came
to
an
end
at
Sky.
The
final
six
hundred
feet
of
the
ascent
were
vertical,
forcing
would-be
visitors
to
dismount
their
mules
and
make
a
choice.
They
could
ride
the
swaying
wooden
basket
that
was
used
to
lift
supplies,
or
clamber
up
a
rocky
chimney
using
handholds
carved
into
the
rock.

Lord
Redfort
and
Lady
Waynwood,
the
most
elderly
of
the
Lords
Declarant,
chose
to
be
drawn
up
by
the
winch,
after
which
the
basket
was
lowered
once
more
for
fat
Lord
Belmore.
The
other
lords
made
the
climb.
Alayne
met
them
in
the
Crescent
Chamber
beside
a
warming
fire,
where
she
welcomed
them
in
Lord
Robert’s
name
and
served
them
bread
and
cheese
and
cups
of
hot
mulled
wine
in
silver
cups.

Petyr
had
given
her
a
roll
of
arms
to
study,
so
she
knew
their
heraldry
if
not
their
faces.
The
red
castle
was
Redfort,
plainly;
a
short
man
with
a
neat
grey
beard
and
mild
eyes.
Lady
Anya
was
the
only
woman
amongst
the
Lords
Declarant,
and
wore
a
deep
green
mantle
with
the
broken
wheel
of
Waynwood
picked
out
in
beads
of
jet.
Six
silver
bells
on
purple,
that
was
Belmore,
pear-bellied
and
round
of
shoulder.
His
beard
was
a
ginger-grey
horror
sprouting
from
a
multiplicity
of
chins.
Symond
Templeton’s,
by
contrast,
was
black
and
sharply
pointed.
A
beak
of
a
nose
and
icy
blue
eyes
made
the
Knight
of
Ninestars
look
like
some
elegant
bird
of
prey.
His
doublet
displayed
nine
black
stars
within
a
golden
saltire.
Young
Lord
Hunter’s
ermine
cloak
confused
her
till
she
spied
the
brooch
that
pinned
it,
five
silver
arrows
fanned.
Alayne
would
have
put
his
age
closer
to
fifty
than
to
forty.
His
father
had
ruled
at
Longbow
Hall
for
nigh
on
sixty
years,
only
to
die
so
abruptly
that
some
whispered
the
new
lord
had
hastened
his
inheritance.
Hunter’s
cheeks
and
nose
were
red
as
apples,
which
bespoke
a
certain
fondness
for
the
grape.
She
made
certain
to
fill
his
cup
as
often
as
he
emptied
it.

The
youngest
man
in
the
party
had
three
ravens
on
his
chest,
each
clutching
a
blood-red
heart
in
its
talons.
His
brown
hair
was
shoulder
length;
one
stray
lock
curled
down
across
his
forehead.
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
Alayne
thought,
with
a
wary
glance
at
his
hard
mouth
and
restless
eyes.

Last
of
all
came
the
Royces,
Lord
Nestor
and
Bronze
Yohn.
The
Lord
of
Runestone
stood
as
tall
as
the
Hound.
Though
his
hair
was
grey
and
his
face
lined,
Lord
Yohn
still
looked
as
though
he
could
break
most
younger
men
like
twigs
in
those
huge
gnarled
hands.
His
seamed
and
solemn
face
brought
back
all
of
Sansa’s
memories
of
his
time
at
Winterfell.
She
remembered
him
at
table,
speaking
quietly
with
her
mother.
She
heard
his
voice
booming
off
the
walls
when
he
rode
back
from
a
hunt
with
a
buck
behind
his
saddle.
She
could
see
him
in
the
yard,
a
practice
sword
in
hand,
hammering
her
father
to
the
ground
and
turning
to
defeat
Ser
Rodrik
as
well.
He
will
know
me.
How
could
he
not?
She
considered
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
to
beg
for
his
protection.
He
never
fought
for
Robb,
why
should
he
fight
for
me?
The
war
is
finished
and
Winterfell
is
fallen.
“Lord
Royce,”
she
asked
timidly,
“will
you
have
a
cup
of
wine,
to
take
the
chill
off?”

Bronze
Yohn
had
slate-grey
eyes,
half-hidden
beneath
the
bushiest
eyebrows
she
had
ever
seen.
They
crinkled
when
he
looked
down
at
her.
“Do
I
know
you,
girl?”

Alayne
felt
as
though
she
had
swallowed
her
tongue,
but
Lord
Nestor
rescued
her.
“Alayne
is
the
Lord
Protector’s
natural
daughter,”
he
told
his
cousin
gruffly.

“Littlefinger’s
little
finger
has
been
busy,”
said
Lyn
Corbray,
with
a
wicked
smile.
Belmore
laughed,
and
Alayne
could
feel
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks.

“How
old
are
you,
child?”
asked
Lady
Waynwood.

“Four-fourteen,
my
lady.”
For
a
moment
she
forgot
how
old
Alayne
should
be.
“And
I
am
no
child,
but
a
maiden
flowered.”

“But
not
deflowered,
one
can
hope.”
Young
Lord
Hunter’s
bushy
mustache
hid
his
mouth
entirely.

“Yet,”
said
Lyn
Corbray,
as
if
she
were
not
there.
“But
ripe
for
plucking
soon,
I’d
say.”

“Is
that
what
passes
for
courtesy
at
Heart’s
Home?”
Anya
Waynwood’s
hair
was
greying
and
she
had
crow’s-feet
around
her
eyes
and
loose
skin
beneath
her
chin,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
air
of
nobility
about
her.
“The
girl
is
young
and
gently
bred,
and
has
suffered
enough
horrors.
Mind
your
tongue,
ser.”

“My
tongue
is
my
concern,”
Corbray
replied.
“Your
ladyship
should
take
care
to
mind
her
own.
I
have
never
taken
kindly
to
chastisement,
as
any
number
of
dead
men
could
tell
you.”

Lady
Waynwood
turned
away
from
him.
“Best
take
us
to
your
father,
Alayne.
The
sooner
we
are
done
with
this,
the
better.”

“The
Lord
Protector
awaits
you
in
the
solar.
If
my
lords
would
follow
me.”
From
the
Crescent
Chamber
they
climbed
a
steep
flight
of
marble
steps
that
bypassed
both
undercrofts
and
dungeons
and
passed
beneath
three
murder
holes,
which
the
Lords
Declarant
pretended
not
to
notice.
Belmore
was
soon
puffing
like
a
bellows,
and
Redfort’s
face
turned
as
grey
as
his
hair.
The
guards
atop
the
stairs
raised
the
portcullis
at
their
coming.
“This
way,
if
it
please
my
lords.”
Alayne
led
them
down
the
arcade
past
a
dozen
splendid
tapestries.
Ser
Lothor
Brune
stood
outside
the
solar.
He
opened
the
door
for
them
and
followed
them
inside.

Petyr
was
seated
at
the
trestle
table
with
a
cup
of
wine
to
hand,
looking
over
a
crisp
white
parchment.
He
glanced
up
as
the
Lords
Declarant
filed
in.
“My
lords,
be
welcome.
And
you
as
well,
my
lady.
The
ascent
is
wearisome,
I
know.
Please
be
seated.
Alayne,
my
sweet,
more
wine
for
our
noble
guests.”

“As
you
say,
Father.”
The
candles
had
been
lighted,
she
was
pleased
to
see;
the
solar
smelled
of
nutmeg
and
other
costly
spices.
She
went
to
fetch
the
flagon
whilst
the
visitors
arranged
themselves
side
by
side...
all
save
Nestor
Royce,
who
hesitated
before
walking
around
the
table
to
take
the
empty
chair
beside
Lord
Petyr,
and
Lyn
Corbray,
who
went
to
stand
beside
the
hearth
instead.
The
heart-shaped
ruby
in
the
pommel
of
his
sword
shone
redly
as
he
warmed
his
hands.
Alayne
saw
him
smile
at
Ser
Lothor
Brune.
Ser
Lyn
is
very
handsome,
for
an
older
man,
she
thought,
but
I
do
not
like
the
way
he
smiles.

“I
have
been
reading
this
remarkable
declaration
of
yours,”
Petyr
began.
“Splendid.
Whatever
maester
wrote
this
has
a
gift
for
words.
I
only
wish
you
had
invited
me
to
sign
as
well.”

That
took
them
unawares.
“You?”
said
Belmore.
“Sign?”

“I
wield
a
quill
as
well
as
any
man,
and
no
one
loves
Lord
Robert
more
than
I
do.
As
for
these
false
friends
and
evil
counselors,
by
all
means
let
us
root
them
out.
My
lords,
I
am
with
you,
heart
and
hand.
Show
me
where
to
sign,
I
beg
you.”

Alayne,
pouring,
heard
Lyn
Corbray
chuckle.
The
others
seemed
at
a
loss
till
Bronze
Yohn
Royce
cracked
his
knuckles,
and
said,
“We
did
not
come
for
your
signature.
Nor
do
we
mean
to
bandy
words
with
you,
Littlefinger.”

“What
a
pity.
I
do
so
love
a
nicely
bandied
word.”
Petyr
set
the
parchment
to
one
side.
“As
you
wish.
Let
us
be
blunt.
What
would
you
have
of
me,
my
lords
and
lady?”

“We
will
have
naught
of
you.”
Symond
Templeton
fixed
the
Lord
Protector
with
his
cold
blue
stare.
“We
will
have
you
gone.”

“Gone?”
Petyr
feigned
surprise.
“Where
would
I
go?”

“The
crown
has
made
you
Lord
of
Harrenhal,”
Young
Lord
Hunter
pointed
out.
“That
should
be
enough
for
any
man.”

“The
riverlands
have
need
of
a
lord,”
old
Horton
Redfort
said.
“Riverrun
stands
besieged,
Bracken
and
Blackwood
are
at
open
war,
and
outlaws
roam
freely
on
both
sides
of
the
Trident,
stealing
and
killing
as
they
will.
Unburied
corpses
litter
the
landscape
everywhere
you
go.”

“You
make
it
sound
so
wonderfully
attractive,
Lord
Redfort,”
Petyr
answered,
“but
as
it
happens
I
have
pressing
duties
here.
And
there
is
Lord
Robert
to
consider.
Would
you
have
me
drag
a
sickly
child
into
the
midst
of
such
carnage?”

“His
lordship
will
remain
in
the
Vale,”
declared
Yohn
Royce.

“I
mean
to
take
the
boy
with
me
to
Runestone,
and
raise
him
up
to
be
a
knight
that
Jon
Arryn
would
be
proud
of.”

“Why
Runestone?”
Petyr
mused.
“Why
not
Ironoaks
or
the
Redfort?
Why
not
Longbow
Hall?”

“Any
of
these
would
serve
as
well,”
declared
Lord
Belmore,
“and
his
lordship
will
visit
each
in
turn,
in
due
time.”

“Will
he?”
Petyr’s
tone
seemed
to
hint
at
doubts.

Lady
Waynwood
sighed.
“Lord
Petyr,
if
you
think
to
set
us
one
against
the
other,
you
may
spare
yourself
the
effort.
We
speak
with
one
voice
here.
Runestone
suits
us
all.
Lord
Yohn
raised
three
fine
sons
of
his
own,
there
is
no
man
more
fit
to
foster
his
young
lordship.
Maester
Helliweg
is
a
good
deal
older
and
more
experienced
than
your
own
Maester
Colemon,
and
better
suited
to
treat
Lord
Robert’s
frailties.
In
Runestone
the
boy
will
learn
the
arts
of
war
from
Strong
Sam
Stone.
No
man
could
hope
for
a
finer
master-at-arms.
Septon
Lucos
will
instruct
him
in
matters
of
the
spirit.
At
Runestone
he
will
also
find
other
boys
his
own
age,
more
suitable
companions
than
the
old
women
and
sellswords
that
presently
surround
him.”

Petyr
Baelish
fingered
his
beard.
“His
lordship
needs
companions,
I
do
not
disagree.
Alayne
is
hardly
an
old
woman,
though.
Lord
Robert
loves
my
daughter
dearly,
he
will
be
glad
to
tell
you
so
himself.
And
as
it
happens,
I
have
asked
Lord
Grafton
and
Lord
Lynderly
to
send
me
each
a
son
to
ward.
Each
of
them
has
a
boy
of
an
age
with
Robert.”

Lyn
Corbray
laughed.
“Two
pups
from
a
pair
of
lapdogs.”

“Robert
should
have
an
older
boy
about
him
too.
A
promising
young
squire,
say.
Someone
he
could
admire
and
try
to
emulate.”
Petyr
turned
to
Lady
Waynwood.
“You
have
such
a
boy
at
Ironoaks,
my
lady.
Perhaps
you
might
agree
to
send
me
Harrold
Hardyng.”

Anya
Waynwood
seemed
amused.
“Lord
Petyr,
you
are
as
bold
a
thief
as
I’d
ever
care
to
meet.”

“I
do
not
wish
to
steal
the
boy,”
said
Petyr,
“but
he
and
Lord
Robert
should
be
friends.”

Bronze
Yohn
Royce
leaned
forward.
“It
is
meet
and
proper
that
Lord
Robert
should
befriend
young
Harry,
and
he
shall...
at
Runestone,
under
my
care,
as
my
ward
and
squire.”

“Give
us
the
boy,”
said
Lord
Belmore,
“and
you
may
depart
the
Vale
unmolested
for
your
proper
seat
at
Harrenhal.”

Petyr
gave
him
a
look
of
mild
reproach.
“Are
you
suggesting
that
elsewise
I
might
come
to
harm,
my
lord?
I
cannot
think
why.
My
late
wife
seemed
to
think
this
was
my
proper
seat.”

“Lord
Baelish,”
Lady
Waynwood
said,
“Lysa
Tully
was
Jon
Arryn’s
widow
and
the
mother
of
his
child,
and
ruled
here
as
his
regent.
You...
let
us
be
frank,
you
are
no
Arryn,
and
Lord
Robert
is
no
blood
of
yours.
By
what
right
do
you
presume
to
rule
us?”

“Lysa
named
me
Lord
Protector,
I
do
seem
to
recall.”

Young
Lord
Hunter
said,
“Lysa
Tully
was
never
truly
of
the
Vale,
nor
had
she
the
right
to
dispose
of
us.”

“And
Lord
Robert?”
Petyr
asked.
“Will
your
lordship
also
claim
that
Lady
Lysa
had
no
right
to
dispose
of
her
own
son?”

Nestor
Royce
had
been
silent
all
this
while,
but
now
he
spoke
up
loudly.
“I
once
hoped
to
wed
Lady
Lysa
myself.
As
did
Lord
Hunter’s
father
and
Lady
Anya’s
son.
Corbray
scarce
left
her
side
for
half
a
year.
Had
she
chosen
any
one
of
us,
no
man
here
would
dispute
his
right
to
be
the
Lord
Protector.
It
happens
that
she
chose
Lord
Littlefinger,
and
entrusted
her
son
to
his
care.”

“He
was
Jon
Arryn’s
son
as
well,
cousin,”
Bronze
Yohn
said,
frowning
at
the
Keeper.
“He
belongs
to
the
Vale.”

Petyr
feigned
puzzlement.
“The
Eyrie
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
Vale
as
Runestone.
Unless
someone
has
moved
it?”

“Jape
all
you
like,
Littlefinger,”
Lord
Belmore
blustered.
“The
boy
shall
come
with
us.”

“I
am
loath
to
disappoint
you,
Lord
Belmore,
but
my
stepson
will
be
remaining
here
with
me.
He
is
not
a
robust
child,
as
all
of
you
know
well.
The
journey
would
tax
him
sorely.
As
his
stepfather
and
Lord
Protector,
I
cannot
permit
it.”

Symond
Templeton
cleared
his
throat,
and
said,
“Each
of
us
has
a
thousand
men
at
the
foot
of
this
mountain,
Littlefinger.”

“What
a
splendid
place
for
them.”

“If
need
be,
we
can
summon
many
more.”

“Are
you
threatening
me
with
war,
ser?”
Petyr
did
not
sound
the
least
afraid.

Bronze
Yohn
said,
“We
shall
have
Lord
Robert.”

For
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
come
to
an
impasse,
until
Lyn
Corbray
turned
from
the
fire.
“All
this
talk
makes
me
ill.
Littlefinger
will
talk
you
out
of
your
smallclothes
if
you
listen
long
enough.
The
only
way
to
settle
his
sort
is
with
steel.”
He
drew
his
longsword.

Petyr
spread
his
hands.
“I
wear
no
sword,
ser.”

“Easily
remedied.”
Candlelight
rippled
along
the
smoke-grey
steel
of
Corbray’s
blade,
so
dark
that
it
put
Sansa
in
mind
of
Ice,
her
father’s
greatsword.
“Your
apple-eater
holds
a
blade.
Tell
him
to
give
it
to
you,
or
draw
that
dagger.”

She
saw
Lothor
Brune
reach
for
his
own
sword,
but
before
the
blades
could
meet
Bronze
Yohn
rose
in
wrath.
“Put
up
your
steel,
ser!
Are
you
a
Corbray
or
a
Frey?
We
are
guests
here.”

Lady
Waynwood
pursed
her
lips,
and
said,
“This
is
unseemly.”

“Sheathe
your
sword,
Corbray,”
Young
Lord
Hunter
echoed.
“You
shame
us
all
with
this.”

“Come,
Lyn,”
chided
Redfort
in
a
softer
tone.
“This
will
serve
for
nought.
Put
Lady
Forlorn
to
bed.”

“My
lady
has
a
thirst,”
Ser
Lyn
insisted.
“Whenever
she
comes
out
to
dance,
she
likes
a
drop
of
red.”

“Your
lady
must
go
thirsty.”
Bronze
Yohn
put
himself
squarely
in
Corbray’s
path.

“The
Lords
Declarant.”
Lyn
Corbray
snorted.
“You
should
have
named
yourselves
the
Six
Old
Women.”
He
slid
the
dark
sword
back
into
its
scabbard
and
left
them,
shouldering
Brune
aside
as
if
he
were
not
there.
Alayne
listened
to
his
footsteps
recede.

Anya
Waynwood
and
Horton
Redfort
exchanged
a
look.
Hunter
drained
his
wine
cup
and
held
it
out
to
be
refilled.
“Lord
Baelish,”
Ser
Symond
said,
“you
must
forgive
us
that
display.”

“Must
I?”
Littlefinger’s
voice
had
grown
cold.
“You
brought
him
here,
my
lords.”

Bronze
Yohn
said,
“It
was
never
our
intent—”

“You
brought
him
here.
I
would
be
well
within
my
rights
to
call
my
guards
and
have
all
of
you
arrested.”

Hunter
lurched
to
his
feet
so
wildly
that
he
almost
knocked
the
flagon
out
of
Alayne’s
hands.
“You
gave
us
safe
conduct!”

“Yes.
Be
grateful
that
I
have
more
honor
than
some.”
Petyr
sounded
as
angry
as
she
had
ever
heard
him.
“I
have
read
your
declaration
and
heard
your
demands.
Now
hear
mine.
Remove
your
armies
from
this
mountain.
Go
home
and
leave
my
son
in
peace.
Misrule
there
has
been,
I
will
not
deny
it,
but
that
was
Lysa’s
work,
not
mine.
Grant
me
but
a
year,
and
with
Lord
Nestor’s
help
I
promise
that
none
of
you
shall
have
any
cause
for
grievance.”

“So
you
say,”
said
Belmore.
“Yet
how
shall
we
trust
you?”

“You
dare
call
me
untrustworthy?
It
was
not
me
who
bared
steel
at
a
parley.
You
write
of
defending
Lord
Robert
even
as
you
deny
him
food.
That
must
end.
I
am
no
warrior,
but
I
will
fight
you
if
you
do
not
lift
this
siege.
There
are
other
lords
besides
you
in
the
Vale,
and
King’s
Landing
will
send
men
as
well.
If
it
is
war
you
want,
say
so
now
and
the
Vale
will
bleed.”

Alayne
could
see
the
doubt
blooming
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lords
Declarant.
“A
year
is
not
so
long
a
time,”
Lord
Redfort
said
uncertainly.
“Mayhaps...
if
you
gave
assurances...”

“None
of
us
wants
war,”
acknowledged
Lady
Waynwood.
“Autumn
wanes,
and
we
must
gird
ourselves
for
winter.”

Belmore
cleared
his
throat.
“At
the
end
of
this
year...”

“...if
I
have
not
set
the
Vale
to
rights,
I
shall
willingly
step
down
as
Lord
Protector,”
Petyr
promised
them.

“I
call
that
more
than
fair,”
Lord
Nestor
Royce
put
in.

“There
must
be
no
reprisals,”
insisted
Templeton.
“No
talk
of
treason
or
rebellion.
You
must
swear
to
that
as
well.”

“Gladly,”
said
Petyr.
“It
is
friends
I
want,
not
foes.
I
shall
pardon
all
of
you,
in
writing
if
you
wish.
Even
Lyn
Corbray.
His
brother
is
a
good
man,
there
is
no
need
to
bring
down
shame
upon
a
noble
House.”

Lady
Waynwood
turned
to
her
fellow
Lords
Declarant.
“My
lords,
perhaps
we
might
confer?”

“There
is
no
need.
It
is
plain
that
he
has
won.”
Bronze
Yohn’s
grey
eyes
considered
Petyr
Baelish.
“I
like
it
not,
but
it
would
seem
you
have
your
year.
Best
use
it
well,
my
lord.
Not
all
of
us
are
fooled.”
He
opened
the
door
so
forcefully
that
he
all
but
wrenched
it
off
its
hinges.

Later
there
was
a
feast
of
sorts,
though
Petyr
was
forced
to
make
apologies
for
the
humble
fare.
Robert
was
trotted
out
in
a
doublet
of
cream
and
blue,
and
played
the
little
lord
quite
graciously.
Bronze
Yohn
was
not
there
to
see;
he
had
already
departed
from
the
Eyrie
to
begin
the
long
descent,
as
had
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
before
him.
The
other
lords
remained
with
them
till
morn.

He
bewitched
them,
Alayne
thought
as
she
lay
abed
that
night
listening
to
the
wind
howl
outside
her
windows.
She
could
not
have
said
where
the
suspicion
came
from,
but
once
it
crossed
her
mind
it
would
not
let
her
sleep.
She
tossed
and
turned,
worrying
at
it
like
a
dog
at
some
old
bone.
Finally,
she
rose
and
dressed
herself,
leaving
Gretchel
to
her
dreams.

Petyr
was
still
awake,
scratching
out
a
letter.
“Alayne,”
he
said.
“My
sweet.
What
brings
you
here
so
late?”

“I
had
to
know.
What
will
happen
in
a
year?”

He
put
down
his
quill.
“Redfort
and
Waynwood
are
old.
One
or
both
of
them
may
die.
Gilwood
Hunter
will
be
murdered
by
his
brothers.
Most
likely
by
young
Harlan,
who
arranged
Lord
Eon’s
death.
In
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
stag,
I
always
say.
Belmore
is
corrupt
and
can
be
bought.
Templeton
I
shall
befriend.
Bronze
Yohn
Royce
will
continue
to
be
hostile,
I
fear,
but
so
long
as
he
stands
alone
he
is
not
so
much
a
threat.”

“And
Ser
Lyn
Corbray?”

The
candlelight
was
dancing
in
his
eyes.
“Ser
Lyn
will
remain
my
implacable
enemy.
He
will
speak
of
me
with
scorn
and
loathing
to
every
man
he
meets,
and
lend
his
sword
to
every
secret
plot
to
bring
me
down.”

That
was
when
her
suspicion
turned
to
certainty.
“And
how
shall
you
reward
him
for
this
service?”

Littlefinger
laughed
aloud.
“With
gold
and
boys
and
promises,
of
course.
Ser
Lyn
is
a
man
of
simple
tastes,
my
sweetling.
All
he
likes
is
gold
and
boys
and
killing.”





CERSEI

The
king
was
pouting.
“I
want
to
sit
on
the
Iron
Throne,”
he
told
her.
“You
always
let
Joff
sit
up
there.”

“Joffrey
was
twelve.”

“But
I’m
the
king.
The
throne
belongs
to
me.”

“Who
told
you
that?”
Cersei
took
a
deep
breath,
so
Dorcas
could
lace
her
up
more
tightly.
She
was
a
big
girl,
much
stronger
than
Senelle,
though
clumsier
as
well.

Tommen’s
face
turned
red.
“No
one
told
me.”

“No
one?
Is
that
what
you
call
your
lady
wife?”
The
queen
could
smell
Margaery
Tyrell
all
over
this
rebellion.
“If
you
lie
to
me,
I
will
have
no
choice
but
to
send
for
Pate
and
have
him
beaten
till
he
bleeds.”
Pate
was
Tommen’s
whipping
boy,
as
he
had
been
Joffrey’s.
“Is
that
what
you
want?”

“No,”
the
king
muttered
sullenly.

“Who
told
you?”

He
shuffled
his
feet.
“Lady
Margaery.”
He
knew
better
than
to
call
her
queen
in
his
mother’s
hearing.

“That
is
better.
Tommen,
I
have
grave
matters
to
decide,
matters
that
you
are
far
too
young
to
understand.
I
do
not
need
a
silly
little
boy
fidgeting
on
the
throne
behind
me
and
distracting
me
with
childish
questions.
I
suppose
Margaery
thinks
you
ought
to
be
at
my
council
meetings
too?”

“Yes,”
he
admitted.
“She
says
I
have
to
learn
to
be
king.”

“When
you
are
older,
you
can
attend
as
many
councils
as
you
wish,”
Cersei
told
him.
“I
promise
you,
you
will
soon
grow
sick
of
them.
Robert
used
to
doze
through
the
sessions.”
When
he
troubled
to
attend
at
all.
“He
preferred
to
hunt
and
hawk,
and
leave
the
tedium
to
old
Lord
Arryn.
Do
you
remember
him?”

“He
died
of
a
bellyache.”

“So
he
did,
poor
man.
As
you
are
so
eager
to
learn,
perhaps
you
should
learn
the
names
of
all
the
kings
of
Westeros
and
the
Hands
who
served
them.
You
may
recite
them
to
me
on
the
morrow.”

“Yes,
Mother,”
he
said
meekly.

“That’s
my
good
boy.”
The
rule
was
hers;
Cersei
did
not
mean
to
give
it
up
until
Tommen
came
of
age.
I
waited,
so
can
he.
I
waited
half
my
life.
She
had
played
the
dutiful
daughter,
the
blushing
bride,
the
pliant
wife.
She
had
suffered
Robert’s
drunken
groping,
Jaime’s
jealousy,
Renly’s
mockery,
Varys
with
his
titters,
Stannis
endlessly
grinding
his
teeth.
She
had
contended
with
Jon
Arryn,
Ned
Stark,
and
her
vile,
treacherous,
murderous
dwarf
brother,
all
the
while
promising
herself
that
one
day
it
would
be
her
turn.
If
Margaery
Tyrell
thinks
to
cheat
me
of
my
hour
in
the
sun,
she
had
bloody
well
think
again.

Still,
it
was
an
ill
way
to
break
her
fast,
and
Cersei’s
day
did
not
soon
improve.
She
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
with
Lord
Gyles
and
his
ledger
books,
listening
to
him
cough
about
stars
and
stags
and
dragons.
After
him
Lord
Waters
arrived,
to
report
that
the
first
three
dromonds
were
nearing
completion
and
beg
for
more
gold
to
finish
them
in
the
splendor
they
deserved.
The
queen
was
pleased
to
grant
him
his
request.
Moon
Boy
capered
as
she
took
her
midday
meal
with
members
of
the
merchant
guilds
and
listened
to
them
complain
about
sparrows
wandering
the
streets
and
sleeping
in
the
squares.
I
may
need
to
use
the
gold
cloaks
to
chase
these
sparrows
from
the
city,
she
was
thinking,
when
Pycelle
intruded.

The
Grand
Maester
had
been
especially
querulous
in
council
of
late.
At
the
last
session
he
had
complained
bitterly
about
the
men
that
Aurane
Waters
had
chosen
to
captain
her
new
dromonds.
Waters
meant
to
give
the
ships
to
younger
men,
whilst
Pycelle
argued
for
experience,
insisting
that
the
commands
should
go
to
those
captains
who
had
survived
the
fires
of
the
Blackwater.
“Seasoned
men
of
proven
loyalty,”
he
called
them.
Cersei
called
them
old,
and
sided
with
Lord
Waters.
“The
only
thing
these
captains
proved
was
that
they
know
how
to
swim,”
she’d
said.
“No
mother
should
outlive
her
children,
and
no
captain
should
outlive
his
ship.”
Pycelle
had
taken
the
rebuke
with
ill
grace.

He
seemed
less
choleric
today,
and
even
managed
a
sort
of
tremulous
smile.
“Your
Grace,
glad
tidings,”
he
announced.
“Wyman
Manderly
has
done
as
you
commanded,
and
beheaded
Lord
Stannis’s
onion
knight.”

“We
know
this
for
a
certainty?”

“The
man’s
head
and
hands
have
been
mounted
above
the
walls
of
White
Harbor.
Lord
Wyman
avows
this,
and
the
Freys
confirm.
They
have
seen
the
head
there,
with
an
onion
in
its
mouth.
And
the
hands,
one
marked
by
his
shortened
fingers.”

“Very
good,”
said
Cersei.
“Send
a
bird
to
Manderly
and
inform
him
that
his
son
will
be
returned
forthwith,
now
that
he
has
demonstrated
his
loyalty.”
White
Harbor
would
soon
return
to
the
king’s
peace,
and
Roose
Bolton
and
his
bastard
son
were
closing
in
on
Moat
Cailin
from
south
and
north.
Once
the
Moat
was
theirs,
they
would
join
their
strength
and
clear
the
ironmen
out
of
Torrhen’s
Square
and
Deepwood
Motte
as
well.
That
should
win
them
the
allegiance
of
Ned
Stark’s
remaining
bannermen
when
the
time
came
to
march
against
Lord
Stannis.

To
the
south,
meanwhile,
Mace
Tyrell
had
raised
a
city
of
tents
outside
Storm’s
End
and
had
two
dozen
mangonels
flinging
stones
against
the
castle’s
massive
walls,
thus
far
to
small
effect.
Lord
Tyrell
the
warrior,
the
queen
mused.
His
sigil
ought
to
be
a
fat
man
sitting
on
his
arse.

That
afternoon
the
dour
Braavosi
envoy
turned
up
for
his
audience.
Cersei
had
put
him
off
for
a
fortnight
and
would
have
gladly
put
him
off
another
year,
but
Lord
Gyles
claimed
he
could
no
longer
deal
with
the
man...
though
the
queen
was
starting
to
wonder
if
Gyles
was
capable
of
doing
anything
but
coughing.

Noho
Dimittis,
the
Braavosi
named
himself.
An
irritating
name
for
an
irritating
man.
His
voice
was
irritating
too.
Cersei
shifted
in
her
seat
as
he
went
on,
wondering
how
long
she
must
endure
his
hectoring.
Behind
her
loomed
the
Iron
Throne,
its
barbs
and
blades
throwing
twisted
shadows
across
the
floor.
Only
the
king
or
his
Hand
could
sit
upon
the
throne
itself.
Cersei
sat
by
its
foot,
in
a
seat
of
gilded
wood
piled
with
crimson
cushions.

When
the
Braavosi
paused
for
breath,
she
saw
her
chance.
“This
is
more
properly
a
matter
for
our
lord
treasurer.”

That
answer
did
not
please
the
noble
Noho,
it
would
seem.
“I
have
spoken
with
Lord
Gyles
six
times.
He
coughs
at
me
and
makes
excuses,
Your
Grace,
but
the
gold
is
not
forthcoming.”

“Speak
to
him
a
seventh
time,”
Cersei
suggested
pleasantly.
“The
number
seven
is
sacred
to
our
gods.”

“It
pleases
Your
Grace
to
make
a
jest,
I
see.”

“When
I
make
a
jest
I
smile.
Do
you
see
me
smiling?
Do
you
hear
laughter?
I
assure
you,
when
I
make
a
jest,
men
laugh.”

“King
Robert—”

“—is
dead,”
she
said
sharply.
“The
Iron
Bank
will
have
its
gold
when
this
rebellion
has
been
put
down.”

He
had
the
insolence
to
scowl
at
her.
“Your
Grace—”

“This
audience
is
at
an
end.”
Cersei
had
suffered
quite
enough
for
one
day.
“Ser
Meryn,
show
the
noble
Noho
Dimittis
to
the
door.
Ser
Osmund,
you
may
escort
me
back
to
my
apartments.”
Her
guests
would
soon
arrive,
and
she
had
to
bathe
and
change.
Supper
promised
to
be
a
tedious
affair
as
well.
It
was
hard
work
to
rule
a
kingdom,
much
less
seven
of
them.

Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
fell
in
beside
her
on
the
steps,
tall
and
lean
in
his
Kingsguard
whites.
When
Cersei
was
certain
they
were
quite
alone,
she
slid
her
arm
through
his.
“How
is
your
little
brother
faring,
pray?”

Ser
Osmund
looked
uneasy.
“Ah...
well
enough,
only...”

“Only?”
The
queen
let
a
hint
of
anger
edge
her
words.
“I
must
confess,
I
am
running
short
of
patience
with
dear
Osney.
It
is
past
time
he
broke
in
that
little
filly.
I
named
him
Tommen’s
sworn
shield
so
he
could
spend
part
of
every
day
in
Margaery’s
company.
He
should
have
plucked
the
rose
by
now.
Is
the
little
queen
blind
to
his
charms?”

“His
charms
is
fine.
He’s
a
Kettleblack,
ain’t
he?
Begging
your
pardon.”
Ser
Osmund
ran
his
fingers
through
his
oily
black
hair.
“It’s
her
that’s
the
trouble.”

“And
why
is
that?”
The
queen
had
begun
to
nurse
doubts
about
Ser
Osney.
Perhaps
another
man
would
have
been
more
to
Margaery’s
liking.
Aurane
Waters,
with
that
silvery
hair,
or
a
big
strapping
fellow
like
Ser
Tallad.
“Would
the
maid
prefer
someone
else?
Does
your
brother’s
face
displease
her?”

“She
likes
his
face.
She
touched
his
scars
two
days
ago,
he
told
me.
‘What
woman
gave
you
these?’
she
asked.
Osney
never
said
it
was
a
woman,
but
she
knew.
Might
be
someone
told
her.
She’s
always
touching
him
when
they
talk,
he
says.
Straightening
the
clasp
on
his
cloak,
brushing
back
his
hair,
and
like
that.
One
time
at
the
archery
butts
she
had
him
show
her
how
to
hold
a
longbow,
so
he
had
to
put
his
arms
around
her.
Osney
tells
her
bawdy
jests,
and
she
laughs
and
comes
back
with
ones
that
are
even
bawdier.
No,
she
wants
him,
that’s
plain,
but...”

“But?”
Cersei
prompted.

“They
are
never
alone.
The
king’s
with
them
most
all
the
time,
and
when
he’s
not,
there’s
someone
else.
Two
of
her
ladies
share
her
bed,
different
ones
every
night.
Two
others
bring
her
breakfast
and
help
her
dress.
She
prays
with
her
septa,
reads
with
her
cousin
Elinor,
sings
with
her
cousin
Alla,
sews
with
her
cousin
Megga.
When
she’s
not
off
hawking
with
Janna
Fossoway
and
Merry
Crane,
she’s
playing
come-into-my-castle
with
that
little
Bulwer
girl.
She
never
goes
riding
but
she
takes
a
tail,
four
or
five
companions
and
a
dozen
guards
at
least.
And
there’s
always
men
about
her,
even
in
the
Maidenvault.”

“Men.”
That
was
something.
That
had
possibilities.
“What
men
are
these,
pray
tell?”

Ser
Osmund
shrugged.
“Singers.
She’s
a
fool
for
singers
and
jugglers
and
such.
Knights,
come
round
to
moon
over
her
cousins.
Ser
Tallad’s
the
worst,
Osney
says.
That
big
oaf
don’t
seem
to
know
if
it’s
Elinor
or
Alla
he
wants,
but
he
knows
he
wants
her
awful
bad.
The
Redwyne
twins
come
calling
too.
Slobber
brings
flowers
and
fruit,
and
Horror’s
taken
up
the
lute.
To
hear
Osney
tell
it,
you
could
make
a
sweeter
sound
strangling
a
cat.
The
Summer
Islander’s
always
underfoot
as
well.”

“Jalabhar
Xho?”
Cersei
gave
a
derisive
snort.
“Begging
her
for
gold
and
swords
to
win
his
homeland
back,
most
like.”
Beneath
his
jewels
and
feathers,
Xho
was
little
more
than
a
wellborn
beggar.
Robert
could
have
put
an
end
to
his
importuning
for
good
with
one
firm
“No,”
but
the
notion
of
conquering
the
Summer
Isles
had
appealed
to
her
drunken
lout
of
a
husband.
No
doubt
he
dreamt
of
brown-skinned
wenches
naked
beneath
feathered
cloaks,
with
nipples
black
as
coal.
So
instead
of
“No,”
Robert
always
told
Xho,
“Next
year,”
though
somehow
next
year
never
came.

“I
couldn’t
say
if
he
was
begging,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Osmund
answered.
“Osney
says
he’s
teaching
them
the
Summer
Tongue.
Not
Osney,
the
quee—the
filly
and
her
cousins.”

“A
horse
that
speaks
the
Summer
Tongue
would
make
a
great
sensation,”
the
queen
said
dryly.
“Tell
your
brother
to
keep
his
spurs
well
honed.
I
shall
find
some
way
for
him
to
mount
his
filly
soon,
you
may
rely
on
that.”

“I’ll
tell
him,
Your
Grace.
He’s
eager
for
that
ride,
don’t
think
he
ain’t.
She’s
a
pretty
little
thing,
that
filly.”

It
is
me
he’s
eager
for,
fool,
the
queen
thought.
All
he
wants
of
Margaery
is
the
lordship
between
her
legs.
As
fond
as
she
was
of
Osmund,
at
times
he
seemed
as
slow
as
Robert.
I
hope
his
sword
is
quicker
than
his
wits.
The
day
may
come
that
Tommen
has
some
need
of
it.

They
were
crossing
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
broken
Tower
of
the
Hand
when
the
sound
of
cheers
swept
over
them.
Across
the
yard,
some
squire
had
made
a
pass
at
the
quintain
and
sent
the
crossarm
spinning.
The
cheers
were
being
led
by
Margaery
Tyrell
and
her
hens.
A
lot
of
uproar
for
very
little.
You
would
think
the
boy
had
won
a
tourney.
Then
she
was
startled
to
see
that
it
was
Tommen
on
the
courser,
clad
all
in
gilded
plate.

The
queen
had
little
choice
but
to
don
a
smile
and
go
to
see
her
son.
She
reached
him
as
the
Knight
of
Flowers
was
helping
him
from
his
horse.
The
boy
was
breathless
with
excitement.
“Did
you
see?”
he
was
asking
everyone.
“I
did
it
just
the
way
Ser
Loras
said.
Did
you
see,
Ser
Osney?”

“I
did,”
said
Osney
Kettleblack.
“A
pretty
sight.”

“You
have
a
better
seat
than
me,
sire,”
put
in
Ser
Dermot.

“I
broke
the
lance
too.
Ser
Loras,
did
you
hear
it?”

“As
loud
as
a
crack
of
thunder.”
A
rose
of
jade
and
gold
clasped
Ser
Loras’s
white
cloak
at
the
shoulder,
and
the
wind
was
riffling
artfully
through
his
brown
locks.
“You
rode
a
splendid
course,
but
once
is
not
enough.
You
must
do
it
again
upon
the
morrow.
You
must
ride
every
day,
until
every
blow
lands
true
and
straight,
and
your
lance
is
as
much
a
part
of
you
as
your
arm.”

“I
want
to.”

“You
were
glorious.”
Margaery
went
to
one
knee,
kissed
the
king
upon
his
cheek,
and
put
an
arm
around
him.
“Brother,
take
care,”
she
warned
Loras.
“My
gallant
husband
will
be
unhorsing
you
in
a
few
more
years,
I
think.”
Her
three
cousins
all
agreed,
and
the
wretched
little
Bulwer
girl
began
to
hop
about,
chanting,
“Tommen
will
be
the
champion,
the
champion,
the
champion.”

“When
he
is
a
man
grown,”
said
Cersei.

Their
smiles
withered
like
roses
kissed
by
frost.
The
pock-faced
old
septa
was
the
first
to
bend
her
knee.
The
rest
followed,
save
for
the
little
queen
and
her
brother.

Tommen
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
sudden
chill
in
the
air.
“Mother,
did
you
see
me?”
he
burbled
happily.
“I
broke
my
lance
on
the
shield,
and
the
bag
never
hit
me!”

“I
was
watching
from
across
the
yard.
You
did
very
well,
Tommen.
I
would
expect
no
less
of
you.
Jousting
is
in
your
blood.
One
day
you
shall
rule
the
lists,
as
your
father
did.”

“No
man
will
stand
before
him.”
Margaery
Tyrell
gave
the
queen
a
coy
smile.
“But
I
never
knew
that
King
Robert
was
so
accomplished
at
the
joust.
Pray
tell
us,
Your
Grace,
what
tourneys
did
he
win?
What
great
knights
did
he
unseat?
I
know
the
king
should
like
to
hear
about
his
father’s
victories.”

A
flush
crept
up
Cersei’s
neck.
The
girl
had
caught
her
out.
Robert
Baratheon
had
been
an
indifferent
jouster,
in
truth.
During
tourneys
he
had
much
preferred
the
mêlée,
where
he
could
beat
men
bloody
with
blunted
axe
or
hammer.
It
had
been
Jaime
she
had
been
thinking
of
when
she
spoke.
It
is
not
like
me
to
forget
myself.
“Robert
won
the
tourney
of
the
Trident,”
she
had
to
say.
“He
overthrew
Prince
Rhaegar
and
named
me
his
queen
of
love
and
beauty.
I
am
surprised
you
do
not
know
that
story,
good-daughter.”
She
gave
Margaery
no
time
to
frame
a
reply.
“Ser
Osmund,
help
my
son
from
his
armor,
if
you
would
be
so
good.
Ser
Loras,
walk
with
me.
I
need
a
word
with
you.”

The
Knight
of
Flowers
had
no
recourse
but
to
follow
at
her
heels
like
the
puppy
he
was.
Cersei
waited
until
they
were
on
the
serpentine
steps
before
she
said,
“Whose
notion
was
that,
pray?”

“My
sister’s,”
he
admitted.
“Ser
Tallad,
Ser
Dermot,
and
Ser
Portifer
were
riding
at
the
quintain,
and
the
queen
suggested
that
His
Grace
might
like
to
have
a
turn.”

He
calls
her
that
to
irk
me.
“And
your
part?”

“I
helped
His
Grace
to
don
his
armor
and
showed
him
how
to
couch
his
lance,”
he
answered.

“That
horse
was
much
too
large
for
him.
What
if
he
had
fallen
off?
What
if
the
sandbag
had
smashed
his
head
in?”

“Bruises
and
bloody
lips
are
all
part
of
being
a
knight.”

“I
begin
to
understand
why
your
brother
is
a
cripple.”
That
wiped
the
smile
off
his
pretty
face,
she
was
pleased
to
see.
“Perhaps
my
brother
failed
to
explain
your
duties
to
you,
ser.
You
are
here
to
protect
my
son
from
his
enemies.
Training
him
for
knighthood
is
the
province
of
the
master-at-arms.”

“The
Red
Keep
has
had
no
master-at-arms
since
Aron
Santagar
was
slain,”
Ser
Loras
said,
with
a
hint
of
reproach
in
his
voice.
“His
Grace
is
almost
nine,
and
eager
to
learn.
At
his
age
he
should
be
a
squire.
Someone
has
to
teach
him.”

Someone
will,
but
it
will
not
be
you.
“Pray,
who
did
you
squire
for,
ser?”
she
asked
sweetly.
“Lord
Renly,
was
it
not?”

“I
had
that
honor.”

“Yes,
I
thought
as
much.”
Cersei
had
seen
how
tight
the
bonds
grew
between
squires
and
the
knights
they
served.
She
did
not
want
Tommen
growing
close
to
Loras
Tyrell.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
was
no
sort
of
man
for
any
boy
to
emulate.
“I
have
been
remiss.
With
a
realm
to
rule,
a
war
to
fight,
and
a
father
to
mourn,
somehow
I
overlooked
the
crucial
matter
of
naming
a
new
master-at-arms.
I
shall
rectify
that
error
at
once.”

Ser
Loras
pushed
back
a
brown
curl
that
had
fallen
across
his
forehead.
“Your
Grace
will
not
find
any
man
half
so
skilled
with
sword
and
lance
as
I.”

Humble,
aren’t
we?
“Tommen
is
your
king,
not
your
squire.
You
are
to
fight
for
him
and
die
for
him,
if
need
be.
No
more.”

She
left
him
on
the
drawbridge
that
spanned
the
dry
moat
with
its
bed
of
iron
spikes
and
entered
Maegor’s
Holdfast
alone.
Where
am
I
to
find
a
master-at-arms?
she
wondered
as
she
climbed
to
her
apartments.
Having
refused
Ser
Loras,
she
dare
not
turn
to
any
of
the
Kingsguard
knights;
that
would
be
salt
in
the
wound,
certain
to
anger
Highgarden.
Ser
Tallad?
Ser
Dermot?
There
must
be
someone.
Tommen
was
growing
fond
of
his
new
sworn
shield,
but
Osney
was
proving
himself
less
capable
than
she
had
hoped
in
the
matter
of
Maid
Margaery,
and
she
had
a
different
office
in
mind
for
his
brother
Osfryd.
It
was
rather
a
pity
that
the
Hound
had
gone
rabid.
Tommen
had
always
been
frightened
of
Sandor
Clegane’s
harsh
voice
and
burned
face,
and
Clegane’s
scorn
would
have
been
the
perfect
antidote
to
Loras
Tyrell’s
simpering
chivalry.

Aron
Santagar
was
Dornish,
Cersei
recalled.
I
could
send
to
Dorne.
Centuries
of
blood
and
war
lay
between
Sunspear
and
Highgarden.
Yes,
a
Dornishman
might
suit
my
needs
admirably.
There
must
be
some
good
swords
in
Dorne.

When
she
entered
her
solar,
Cersei
found
Lord
Qyburn
reading
in
a
window
seat.
“If
it
please
Your
Grace,
I
have
reports.”

“More
plots
and
treasons?”
Cersei
asked.
“I
have
had
a
long
and
tiring
day.
Tell
me
quickly.”

He
smiled
sympathetically.
“As
you
wish.
There
is
talk
that
the
Archon
of
Tyrosh
has
offered
terms
to
Lys,
to
end
their
present
trade
war.
It
had
been
rumored
that
Myr
was
about
to
enter
the
war
on
the
Tyroshi
side,
but
without
the
Golden
Company
the
Myrish
did
not
believe
they...”

“What
the
Myrish
believe
does
not
concern
me.”
The
Free
Cities
were
always
fighting
one
another.
Their
endless
betrayals
and
alliances
meant
little
and
less
to
Westeros.
“Do
you
have
any
news
of
more
import?”

“The
slave
revolt
in
Astapor
has
spread
to
Meereen,
it
would
seem.
Sailors
off
a
dozen
ships
speak
of
dragons...”

“Harpies.
It
is
harpies
in
Meereen.”
She
remembered
that
from
somewhere.
Meereen
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
world,
out
east
beyond
Valyria.
“Let
the
slaves
revolt.
Why
should
I
care?
We
keep
no
slaves
in
Westeros.
Is
that
all
you
have
for
me?”

“There
is
some
news
from
Dorne
that
Your
Grace
may
find
of
more
interest.
Prince
Doran
has
imprisoned
Ser
Daemon
Sand,
a
bastard
who
once
squired
for
the
Red
Viper.”

“I
recall
him.”
Ser
Daemon
had
been
amongst
the
Dornish
knights
who
had
accompanied
Prince
Oberyn
to
King’s
Landing.
“What
did
he
do?”

“He
demanded
that
Prince
Oberyn’s
daughters
be
set
free.”

“More
fool
him.”

“Also,”
Lord
Qyburn
said,
“the
daughter
of
the
Knight
of
Spottswood
was
betrothed
quite
unexpectedly
to
Lord
Estermont,
our
friends
in
Dorne
inform
us.
She
was
sent
to
Greenstone
that
very
night,
and
it
is
said
she
and
Estermont
have
already
wed.”

“A
bastard
in
the
belly
would
explain
that.”
Cersei
toyed
with
a
lock
of
her
hair.
“How
old
is
the
blushing
bride?”

“Three-and-twenty,
Your
Grace.
Whereas
Lord
Estermont—”

“—must
be
seventy.
I
am
aware
of
that.”
The
Estermonts
were
her
good-kin
through
Robert,
whose
father
had
taken
one
of
them
to
wife
in
what
must
have
been
a
fit
of
lust
or
madness.
By
the
time
Cersei
wed
the
king,
Robert’s
lady
mother
was
long
dead,
though
both
of
her
brothers
had
turned
up
for
the
wedding
and
stayed
for
half
a
year.
Robert
had
later
insisted
on
returning
the
courtesy
with
a
visit
to
Estermont,
a
mountainous
little
island
off
Cape
Wrath.
The
dank
and
dismal
fortnight
Cersei
spent
at
Greenstone,
the
seat
of
House
Estermont,
was
the
longest
of
her
young
life.
Jaime
dubbed
the
castle
“Greenshit”
at
first
sight,
and
soon
had
Cersei
doing
it
too.
Elsewise
she
passed
her
days
watching
her
royal
husband
hawk,
hunt,
and
drink
with
his
uncles,
and
bludgeon
various
male
cousins
senseless
in
Greenshit’s
yard.

There
had
been
a
female
cousin
too,
a
chunky
little
widow
with
breasts
as
big
as
melons
whose
husband
and
father
had
both
died
at
Storm’s
End
during
the
siege.
“Her
father
was
good
to
me,”
Robert
told
her,
“and
she
and
I
would
play
together
when
the
two
of
us
were
small.”
It
did
not
take
him
long
to
start
playing
with
her
again.
As
soon
as
Cersei
closed
her
eyes,
the
king
would
steal
off
to
console
the
poor
lonely
creature.
One
night
she
had
Jaime
follow
him,
to
confirm
her
suspicions.
When
her
brother
returned
he
asked
her
if
she
wanted
Robert
dead.
“No,”
she
had
replied,
“I
want
him
horned.”
She
liked
to
think
that
was
the
night
when
Joffrey
was
conceived.

“Eldon
Estermont
has
taken
a
wife
fifty
years
his
junior,”
she
said
to
Qyburn.
“Why
should
that
concern
me?”

He
shrugged.
“I
do
not
say
it
should...
but
Daemon
Sand
and
this
Santagar
girl
were
both
close
to
Prince
Doran’s
own
daughter,
Arianne,
or
so
the
Dornishmen
would
have
us
believe.
Perhaps
it
means
little
or
less,
but
I
thought
Your
Grace
should
know.”

“Now
I
do.”
She
was
losing
patience.
“Do
you
have
more?”

“One
more
thing.
A
trifling
matter.”
He
gave
her
an
apologetic
smile
and
told
her
of
a
puppet
show
that
had
recently
become
popular
amongst
the
city’s
smallfolk;
a
puppet
show
wherein
the
kingdom
of
the
beasts
was
ruled
by
a
pride
of
haughty
lions.
“The
puppet
lions
grow
greedy
and
arrogant
as
this
treasonous
tale
proceeds,
until
they
begin
to
devour
their
own
subjects.
When
the
noble
stag
makes
objection,
the
lions
devour
him
as
well,
and
roar
that
it
is
their
right
as
the
mightiest
of
beasts.”

“And
is
that
the
end
of
it?”
Cersei
asked,
amused.
Looked
at
in
the
right
light,
it
could
be
seen
as
a
salutary
lesson.

“No,
Your
Grace.
At
the
end
a
dragon
hatches
from
an
egg
and
devours
all
of
the
lions.”

The
ending
took
the
puppet
show
from
simple
insolence
to
treason.
“Witless
fools.
Only
cretins
would
hazard
their
heads
upon
a
wooden
dragon.”
She
considered
a
moment.
“Send
some
of
your
whisperers
to
these
shows
and
make
note
of
who
attends.
If
any
of
them
should
be
men
of
note,
I
would
know
their
names.”

“What
will
be
done
with
them,
if
I
may
be
so
bold?”

“Any
men
of
substance
shall
be
fined.
Half
their
worth
should
be
sufficient
to
teach
them
a
sharp
lesson
and
refill
our
coffers,
without
quite
ruining
them.
Those
too
poor
to
pay
can
lose
an
eye,
for
watching
treason.
For
the
puppeteers,
the
axe.”

“There
are
four.
Perhaps
Your
Grace
might
allow
me
two
of
them
for
mine
own
purposes.
A
woman
would
be
especially...”

“I
gave
you
Senelle,”
the
queen
said
sharply.

“Alas.
The
poor
girl
is
quite...
exhausted.”

Cersei
did
not
like
to
think
about
that.
The
girl
had
come
with
her
unsuspecting,
thinking
she
was
along
to
serve
and
pour.
Even
when
Qyburn
clapped
the
chain
around
her
wrist,
she
had
not
seemed
to
understand.
The
memory
still
made
the
queen
queasy.
The
cells
were
bitter
cold.
Even
the
torches
shivered.
And
that
foul
thing
screaming
in
the
darkness...
“Yes,
you
may
take
a
woman.
Two,
if
it
please
you.
But
first
I
will
have
names.”

“As
you
command.”
Qyburn
withdrew.

Outside,
the
sun
was
setting.
Dorcas
had
prepared
a
bath
for
her.
The
queen
was
soaking
pleasantly
in
the
warm
water
and
contemplating
what
she
would
say
to
her
supper
guests
when
Jaime
came
bursting
through
the
door
and
ordered
Jocelyn
and
Dorcas
from
the
room.
Her
brother
looked
rather
less
than
immaculate
and
had
a
smell
of
horse
about
him.
He
had
Tommen
with
him
too.
“Sweet
sister,”
he
said,
“the
king
requires
a
word.”

Cersei’s
golden
tresses
floated
in
the
bathwater.
The
room
was
steamy.
A
drop
of
sweat
trickled
down
her
cheek.
“Tommen?”
she
said,
in
a
dangerously
soft
voice.
“What
is
it
now?”

The
boy
knew
that
tone.
He
shrank
back.

“His
Grace
wants
his
white
courser
on
the
morrow,”
Jaime
said.
“For
his
jousting
lesson.”

She
sat
up
in
the
tub.
“There
will
be
no
jousting.”

“Yes,
there
will.”
Tommen
puffed
out
his
lower
lip.
“I
have
to
ride
every
day.”

“And
you
shall,”
the
queen
declared,
“once
we
have
a
proper
master-at-arms
to
supervise
your
training.”

“I
don’t
want
a
proper
master-at-arms.
I
want
Ser
Loras.”

“You
make
too
much
of
that
boy.
Your
little
wife
has
filled
your
head
with
foolish
notions
of
his
prowess,
I
know,
but
Osmund
Kettleblack
is
thrice
the
knight
that
Loras
is.”

Jaime
laughed.
“Not
the
Osmund
Kettleblack
I
know.”

She
could
have
throttled
him.
Perhaps
I
need
to
command
Ser
Loras
to
allow
Ser
Osmund
to
unhorse
him.
That
might
chase
the
stars
from
Tommen’s
eyes.
Salt
a
slug
and
shame
a
hero,
and
they
shrink
right
up.
“I
am
sending
for
a
Dornishman
to
train
you,”
she
said.
“The
Dornish
are
the
finest
jousters
in
the
realm.”

“They
are
not,”
said
Tommen.
“Anyway,
I
don’t
want
any
stupid
Dornishman,
I
want
Ser
Loras.
I
command
it.”

Jaime
laughed.
He
is
no
help
at
all.
Does
he
think
this
is
amusing?
The
queen
slapped
the
water
angrily.
“Must
I
send
for
Pate?
You
do
not
command
me.
I
am
your
mother.”

“Yes,
but
I’m
the
king.
Margaery
says
that
everyone
has
to
do
what
the
king
says.
I
want
my
white
courser
saddled
on
the
morrow
so
Ser
Loras
can
teach
me
how
to
joust.
I
want
a
kitten
too,
and
I
don’t
want
to
eat
beets.”
He
crossed
his
arms.

Jaime
was
still
laughing.
The
queen
ignored
him.
“Tommen,
come
here.”
When
he
hung
back,
she
sighed.
“Are
you
afraid?
A
king
should
not
show
fear.”
The
boy
approached
the
tub,
his
eyes
downcast.
She
reached
out
and
stroked
his
golden
curls.
“King
or
no,
you
are
a
little
boy.
Until
you
come
of
age,
the
rule
is
mine.
You
will
learn
to
joust,
I
promise
you.
But
not
from
Loras.
The
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
have
more
important
duties
than
playing
with
a
child.
Ask
the
Lord
Commander.
Isn’t
that
so,
ser?”

“Very
important
duties.”
Jaime
smiled
thinly.
“Riding
round
the
city
walls,
for
an
instance.”

Tommen
looked
close
to
tears.
“Can
I
still
have
a
kitten?”

“Perhaps,”
the
queen
allowed.
“So
long
as
I
hear
no
more
nonsense
about
jousting.
Can
you
promise
me
that?”

He
shuffled
his
feet.
“Yes.”

“Good.
Now
run
along.
My
guests
will
be
here
shortly.”

Tommen
ran
along,
but
before
he
left
he
turned
back
to
say,
“When
I’m
king
in
my
own
right,
I’m
going
to
outlaw
beets.”

Her
brother
shoved
the
door
shut
with
his
stump.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said,
when
he
and
Cersei
were
alone,
“I
was
wondering.
Are
you
drunk,
or
merely
stupid?”

She
slapped
the
water
once
again,
sending
up
another
splash
to
wash
across
his
feet.
“Guard
your
tongue,
or—”

“—or
what?
Will
you
send
me
to
inspect
the
city
walls
again?”
He
sat
and
crossed
his
legs.
“Your
bloody
walls
are
fine.
I’ve
crawled
over
every
inch
of
them
and
had
a
look
at
all
seven
of
the
gates.
The
hinges
on
the
Iron
Gate
are
rusted,
and
the
King’s
Gate
and
Mud
Gate
need
to
be
replaced
after
the
pounding
Stannis
gave
them
with
his
rams.
The
walls
are
as
strong
as
they
have
ever
been...
but
perchance
Your
Grace
has
forgotten
that
our
friends
of
Highgarden
are
inside
the
walls?”

“I
forget
nothing,”
she
told
him,
thinking
of
a
certain
gold
coin,
with
a
hand
on
one
face
and
the
head
of
a
forgotten
king
on
the
other.
How
did
some
miserable
wretch
of
a
gaoler
come
to
have
such
a
coin
hidden
beneath
his
chamber
pot?
How
does
a
man
like
Rugen
come
to
have
old
gold
from
Highgarden?

“This
is
the
first
I
have
heard
of
a
new
master-at-arms.
You’ll
need
to
look
long
and
hard
to
find
a
better
jouster
than
Loras
Tyrell.
Ser
Loras
is—”

“I
know
what
he
is.
I
won’t
have
him
near
my
son.
You
had
best
remind
him
of
his
duties.”
Her
bath
was
growing
cool.

“He
knows
his
duties,
and
there’s
no
better
lance—”

“You
were
better,
before
you
lost
your
hand.
Ser
Barristan,
when
he
was
young.
Arthur
Dayne
was
better,
and
Prince
Rhaegar
was
a
match
for
even
him.
Do
not
prate
at
me
about
how
fierce
the
Flower
is.
He’s
just
a
boy.”
She
was
tired
of
Jaime
balking
her.
No
one
had
ever
balked
her
lord
father.
When
Tywin
Lannister
spoke,
men
obeyed.
When
Cersei
spoke,
they
felt
free
to
counsel
her,
to
contradict
her,
even
refuse
her.
It
is
all
because
I
am
a
woman.
Because
I
cannot
fight
them
with
a
sword.
They
gave
Robert
more
respect
than
they
give
me,
and
Robert
was
a
witless
sot.
She
would
not
suffer
it,
especially
not
from
Jaime.
I
need
to
rid
myself
of
him,
and
soon.
Once
upon
a
time
she
had
dreamt
that
the
two
of
them
might
rule
the
Seven
Kingdoms
side
by
side,
but
Jaime
had
become
more
of
a
hindrance
than
a
help.

Cersei
rose
from
the
bath.
Water
ran
down
her
legs
and
trickled
from
her
hair.
“When
I
want
your
counsel
I
will
ask
for
it.
Leave
me,
ser.
I
must
needs
dress.”

“Your
supper
guests,
I
know.
What
plot
is
this,
now?
There
are
so
many
I
lose
track.”
His
glance
fell
to
the
water
beading
in
the
golden
hair
between
her
legs.

He
still
wants
me.
“Pining
for
what
you’ve
lost,
brother?”

Jaime
raised
his
eyes.
“I
love
you
too,
sweet
sister.
But
you’re
a
fool.
A
beautiful
golden
fool.”

The
words
stung.
You
called
me
kinder
words
at
Greenstone,
the
night
you
planted
Joff
inside
me,
Cersei
thought.
“Get
out.”
She
turned
her
back
to
him
and
listened
to
him
leave,
fumbling
at
the
door
with
his
stump.

Whilst
Jocelyn
was
making
certain
that
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
supper,
Dorcas
helped
the
queen
into
her
new
gown.
It
had
stripes
of
shiny
green
satin
alternating
with
stripes
of
plush
black
velvet,
and
intricate
black
Myrish
lace
above
the
bodice.
Myrish
lace
was
costly,
but
it
was
necessary
for
a
queen
to
look
her
best
at
all
times,
and
her
wretched
washerwomen
had
shrunk
several
of
her
old
gowns
so
they
no
longer
fit.
She
would
have
whipped
them
for
their
carelessness,
but
Taena
had
urged
her
to
be
merciful.
“The
smallfolk
will
love
you
more
if
you
are
kind,”
she
had
said,
so
Cersei
had
ordered
the
value
of
the
gowns
deducted
from
the
women’s
wages,
a
much
more
elegant
solution.

Dorcas
put
a
silver
looking
glass
into
her
hand.
Very
good,
the
queen
thought,
smiling
at
her
reflection.
It
was
pleasant
to
be
out
of
mourning.
Black
made
her
look
too
pale.
A
pity
I
am
not
supping
with
Lady
Merryweather,
the
queen
reflected.
It
had
been
a
long
day,
and
Taena’s
wit
always
cheered
her.
Cersei
had
not
had
a
friend
she
so
enjoyed
since
Melara
Hetherspoon,
and
Melara
had
turned
out
to
be
a
greedy
little
schemer
with
ideas
above
her
station.
I
should
not
think
ill
of
her.
She’s
dead
and
drowned,
and
she
taught
me
never
to
trust
anyone
but
Jaime.

By
the
time
she
joined
them
in
the
solar,
her
guests
had
made
a
good
start
on
the
hippocras.
Lady
Falyse
not
only
looks
like
a
fish,
she
drinks
like
one,
she
reflected,
when
she
made
note
of
the
half-empty
flagon.
“Sweet
Falyse,”
she
exclaimed,
kissing
the
woman’s
cheek,
“and
brave
Ser
Balman.
I
was
so
distraught
when
I
heard
about
your
dear,
dear
mother.
How
fares
our
Lady
Tanda?”

Lady
Falyse
looked
as
if
she
were
about
to
cry.
“Your
Grace
is
good
to
ask.
Mother’s
hip
was
shattered
by
the
fall,
Maester
Frenken
says.
He
did
what
he
could.
Now
we
pray,
but...”

Pray
all
you
like,
she
will
still
be
dead
before
the
moon
turns.
Women
as
old
as
Tanda
Stokeworth
did
not
survive
a
broken
hip.
“I
shall
add
my
prayers
to
your
own,”
said
Cersei.
“Lord
Qyburn
tells
me
that
Tanda
was
thrown
from
her
horse.”

“Her
saddle
girth
burst
whilst
she
was
riding,”
said
Ser
Balman
Byrch.
“The
stableboy
should
have
seen
the
strap
was
worn.
He
has
been
chastised.”

“Severely,
I
hope.”
The
queen
seated
herself
and
indicated
that
her
guests
should
sit
as
well.
“Will
you
have
another
cup
of
hippocras,
Falyse?
You
were
always
fond
of
it,
I
seem
to
recall.”

“It
is
so
good
of
you
to
remember,
Your
Grace.”

How
could
I
have
forgotten?
Cersei
thought.
Jaime
said
it
was
a
wonder
you
did
not
piss
the
stuff.
“How
was
your
journey?”

“Uncomfortable,”
complained
Falyse.
“It
rained
most
of
the
day.
We
thought
to
spend
the
night
at
Rosby,
but
that
young
ward
of
Lord
Gyles
refused
us
hospitality.”
She
sniffed.
“Mark
my
word,
when
Gyles
dies
that
ill-born
wretch
will
make
off
with
his
gold.
He
may
even
try
and
claim
the
lands
and
lordship,
though
by
rights
Rosby
should
come
to
us
when
Gyles
passes.
My
lady
mother
was
aunt
to
his
second
wife,
third
cousin
to
Gyles
himself.”

Is
your
sigil
a
lamb,
my
lady,
or
some
sort
of
grasping
monkey?
Cersei
thought.
“Lord
Gyles
has
been
threatening
to
die
for
as
long
as
I
have
known
him,
but
he
is
still
with
us,
and
will
be
for
many
years,
I
do
hope.”
She
smiled
pleasantly.
“No
doubt
he
will
cough
the
whole
lot
of
us
into
our
graves.”

“Like
as
not,”
Ser
Balman
agreed.
“Rosby’s
ward
was
not
the
only
one
to
vex
us,
Your
Grace.
We
encountered
ruffians
on
the
road
as
well.
Filthy,
unkempt
creatures,
with
leather
shields
and
axes.
Some
had
stars
sewn
on
their
jerkins,
sacred
stars
of
seven
points,
but
they
had
an
evil
look
about
them
all
the
same.”

“They
were
lice-ridden,
I
am
certain,”
added
Falyse.

“They
call
themselves
sparrows,”
said
Cersei.
“A
plague
upon
the
land.
Our
new
High
Septon
will
need
to
deal
with
them,
once
he
is
crowned.
If
not,
I
shall
deal
with
them
myself.”

“Has
His
High
Holiness
been
chosen
yet?”
asked
Falyse.

“No,”
the
queen
had
to
confess.
“Septon
Ollidor
was
on
the
verge
of
being
chosen,
until
some
of
these
sparrows
followed
him
to
a
brothel
and
dragged
him
naked
out
into
the
street.
Luceon
seems
the
likely
choice
now,
though
our
friends
on
the
other
hill
say
that
he
is
still
a
few
votes
short
of
the
required
number.”

“May
the
Crone
guide
the
deliberations
with
her
golden
lamp
of
wisdom,”
said
Lady
Falyse,
most
piously.

Ser
Balman
shifted
in
his
seat.
“Your
Grace,
an
awkward
matter,
but...
lest
bad
feeling
fester
between
us,
you
should
know
that
neither
my
good
wife
nor
her
mother
had
any
hand
in
the
naming
of
this
bastard
child.
Lollys
is
a
simple
creature,
and
her
husband
is
given
to
black
humors.
I
told
him
to
choose
a
more
fitting
name
for
the
boy.
He
laughed.”

The
queen
sipped
her
wine
and
studied
him.
Ser
Balman
had
been
a
noted
jouster
once,
and
one
of
the
handsomest
knights
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
He
could
still
boast
a
handsome
mustache;
elsewise,
he
had
not
aged
well.
His
wavy
blond
hair
had
retreated,
whilst
his
belly
advanced
inexorably
against
his
doublet.
As
a
catspaw
he
leaves
much
to
be
desired,
she
reflected.
Still,
he
should
serve.
“Tyrion
was
a
king’s
name
before
the
dragons
came.
The
Imp
has
despoiled
it,
but
perhaps
this
child
can
restore
the
name
to
honor.”
If
the
bastard
lives
so
long.
“I
know
you
are
not
to
blame.
Lady
Tanda
is
the
sister
that
I
never
had,
and
you...”
Her
voice
broke.
“Forgive
me.
I
live
in
fear.”

Falyse
opened
and
closed
her
mouth,
which
made
her
look
like
some
especially
stupid
fish.
“In...
in
fear,
Your
Grace?”

“I
have
not
slept
a
whole
night
through
since
Joffrey
died.”
Cersei
filled
the
goblets
with
hippocras.
“My
friends...
you
are
my
friends,
I
hope?
And
King
Tommen’s?”

“That
sweet
lad,”
Ser
Balman
declared.
“Your
Grace,
the
very
words
of
House
Stokeworth
are
Proud
to
Be
Faithful.”

“Would
that
there
were
more
like
you,
good
ser.
I
tell
you
truly,
I
have
grave
doubts
about
Ser
Bronn
of
the
Blackwater.”

Husband
and
wife
exchanged
a
look.
“The
man
is
insolent,
Your
Grace,”
Falyse
said.
“Uncouth
and
foul-mouthed.”

“He
is
no
true
knight,”
Ser
Balman
said.

“No.”
Cersei
smiled,
all
for
him.
“And
you
are
a
man
who
would
know
true
knighthood.
I
remember
watching
you
joust
in...
which
tourney
was
it
where
you
fought
so
brilliantly,
ser?”

He
smiled
modestly.
“That
affair
at
Duskendale
six
years
ago?
No,
you
were
not
there,
else
you
would
surely
have
been
crowned
the
queen
of
love
and
beauty.
Was
it
the
tourney
at
Lannisport
after
Greyjoy’s
Rebellion?
I
unhorsed
many
a
good
knight
in
that
one...”

“That
was
the
one.”
Her
face
grew
somber.
“The
Imp
vanished
the
night
my
father
died,
leaving
two
honest
gaolers
behind
in
pools
of
blood.
Some
claim
he
fled
across
the
narrow
sea,
but
I
wonder.
The
dwarf
is
cunning.
Perhaps
he
still
lurks
near,
planning
more
murders.
Perhaps
some
friend
is
hiding
him.”

“Bronn?”
Ser
Balman
stroked
his
bushy
mustache.

“He
was
ever
the
Imp’s
creature.
Only
the
Stranger
knows
how
many
men
he’s
sent
to
hell
at
Tyrion’s
behest.”

“Your
Grace,
I
think
I
should
have
noticed
a
dwarf
skulking
about
our
lands,”
said
Ser
Balman.

“My
brother
is
small.
He
was
made
for
skulking.”
Cersei
let
her
hand
shake.
“A
child’s
name
is
a
small
thing...
but
insolence
unpunished
breeds
rebellion.
And
this
man
Bronn
has
been
gathering
sellswords
to
him,
Qyburn
has
told
me.”

“He
has
taken
four
knights
into
his
household,”
said
Falyse.

Ser
Balman
snorted.
“My
good
wife
flatters
them,
to
call
them
knights.
They’re
upjumped
sellswords,
with
not
a
thimble
of
chivalry
to
be
found
amongst
the
four
of
them.”

“As
I
feared.
Bronn
is
gathering
swords
for
the
dwarf.
May
the
Seven
save
my
little
son.
The
Imp
will
kill
him
as
he
killed
his
brother.”
She
sobbed.
“My
friends,
I
put
my
honor
in
your
hands...
but
what
is
a
queen’s
honor
against
a
mother’s
fears?”

“Say
on,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Balman
assured
her.
“Your
words
shall
ne’er
leave
this
room.”

Cersei
reached
across
the
table
and
gave
his
hand
a
squeeze.
“I...
I
would
sleep
more
easily
of
a
night
if
I
were
to
hear
that
Ser
Bronn
had
suffered
a...
a
mishap...
whilst
hunting,
perhaps.”

Ser
Balman
considered
a
moment.
“A
mortal
mishap?”

No,
I
desire
you
to
break
his
little
toe.
She
had
to
bite
her
lip.
My
enemies
are
everywhere
and
my
friends
are
fools.
“I
beg
you,
ser,”
she
whispered,
“do
not
make
me
say
it...”

“I
understand.”
Ser
Balman
raised
a
finger.

A
turnip
would
have
grasped
it
quicker.
“You
are
a
true
knight
indeed,
ser.
The
answer
to
a
frightened
mother’s
prayers.”
Cersei
kissed
him.
“Do
it
quickly,
if
you
would.
Bronn
has
only
a
few
men
about
him
now,
but
if
we
do
not
act,
he
will
surely
gather
more.”
She
kissed
Falyse.
“I
shall
never
forget
this,
my
friends.
My
true
friends
of
Stokeworth.
Proud
to
Be
Faithful.
You
have
my
word,
we
shall
find
Lollys
a
better
husband
when
this
is
done.”
A
Kettleblack,
perhaps.
“We
Lannisters
pay
our
debts.”

The
rest
was
hippocras
and
buttered
beets,
hot-baked
bread,
herb-crusted
pike,
and
ribs
of
wild
boar.
Cersei
had
become
very
fond
of
boar
since
Robert’s
death.
She
did
not
even
mind
the
company,
though
Falyse
simpered
and
Balman
preened
from
soup
to
sweet.
It
was
past
midnight
before
she
could
rid
herself
of
them.
Ser
Balman
proved
a
great
one
for
suggesting
yet
another
flagon,
and
the
queen
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
refuse.
I
could
have
hired
a
Faceless
Man
to
kill
Bronn
for
half
of
what
I’ve
spent
on
hippocras,
she
reflected
when
they
were
gone
at
last.

At
that
hour,
her
son
was
fast
asleep,
but
Cersei
looked
in
upon
him
before
seeking
her
own
bed.
She
was
surprised
to
find
three
black
kittens
cuddled
up
beside
him.
“Where
did
those
come
from?”
she
asked
Ser
Meryn
Trant,
outside
the
royal
bedchamber.

“The
little
queen
gave
them
to
him.
She
only
meant
to
give
him
one,
but
he
couldn’t
decide
which
one
he
liked
the
best.”

Better
than
cutting
them
out
of
their
mother
with
a
dagger,
I
suppose.
Margaery’s
clumsy
attempts
at
seduction
were
so
obvious
as
to
be
laughable.
Tommen
is
too
young
for
kisses,
so
she
gives
him
kittens.
Cersei
rather
wished
they
were
not
black,
though.
Black
cats
brought
ill
luck,
as
Rhaegar’s
little
girl
had
discovered
in
this
very
castle.
She
would
have
been
my
daughter,
if
the
Mad
King
had
not
played
his
cruel
jape
on
Father.
It
had
to
have
been
the
madness
that
led
Aerys
to
refuse
Lord
Tywin’s
daughter
and
take
his
son
instead,
whilst
marrying
his
own
son
to
a
feeble
Dornish
princess
with
black
eyes
and
a
flat
chest.

The
memory
of
the
rejection
still
rankled,
even
after
all
these
years.
Many
a
night
she
had
watched
Prince
Rhaegar
in
the
hall,
playing
his
silver-stringed
harp
with
those
long,
elegant
fingers
of
his.
Had
any
man
ever
been
so
beautiful?
He
was
more
than
a
man,
though.
His
blood
was
the
blood
of
old
Valyria,
the
blood
of
dragons
and
gods.
When
she
was
just
a
little
girl,
her
father
had
promised
her
that
she
would
marry
Rhaegar.
She
could
not
have
been
more
than
six
or
seven.
“Never
speak
of
it,
child,”
he
had
told
her,
smiling
his
secret
smile
that
only
Cersei
ever
saw.
“Not
until
His
Grace
agrees
to
the
betrothal.
It
must
remain
our
secret
for
now.”
And
so
it
had,
though
once
she
had
drawn
a
picture
of
herself
flying
behind
Rhaegar
on
a
dragon,
her
arms
wrapped
tight
about
his
chest.
When
Jaime
had
discovered
it
she
told
him
it
was
Queen
Alysanne
and
King
Jaehaerys.

She
was
ten
when
she
finally
saw
her
prince
in
the
flesh,
at
the
tourney
her
lord
father
had
thrown
to
welcome
King
Aerys
to
the
west.
Viewing
stands
had
been
raised
beneath
the
walls
of
Lannisport,
and
the
cheers
of
the
smallfolk
had
echoed
off
Casterly
Rock
like
rolling
thunder.
They
cheered
Father
twice
as
loudly
as
they
cheered
the
king,
the
queen
recalled,
but
only
half
as
loudly
as
they
cheered
Prince
Rhaegar.

Seventeen
and
new
to
knighthood,
Rhaegar
Targaryen
had
worn
black
plate
over
golden
ringmail
when
he
cantered
onto
the
lists.
Long
streamers
of
red
and
gold
and
orange
silk
had
floated
behind
his
helm,
like
flames.
Two
of
her
uncles
fell
before
his
lance,
along
with
a
dozen
of
her
father’s
finest
jousters,
the
flower
of
the
west.
By
night
the
prince
played
his
silver
harp
and
made
her
weep.
When
she
had
been
presented
to
him,
Cersei
had
almost
drowned
in
the
depths
of
his
sad
purple
eyes.
He
has
been
wounded,
she
recalled
thinking,
but
I
will
mend
his
hurt
when
we
are
wed.
Next
to
Rhaegar,
even
her
beautiful
Jaime
had
seemed
no
more
than
a
callow
boy.
The
prince
is
going
to
be
my
husband,
she
had
thought,
giddy
with
excitement,
and
when
the
old
king
dies
I’ll
be
the
queen.
Her
aunt
had
confided
that
truth
to
her
before
the
tourney.
“You
must
be
especially
beautiful,”
Lady
Genna
told
her,
fussing
with
her
dress,
“for
at
the
final
feast
it
shall
be
announced
that
you
and
Prince
Rhaegar
are
betrothed.”

Cersei
had
been
so
happy
that
day.
Elsewise
she
would
never
have
dared
visit
the
tent
of
Maggy
the
Frog.
She
had
only
done
it
to
show
Jeyne
and
Melara
that
the
lioness
fears
nothing.
I
was
going
to
be
a
queen.
Why
should
a
queen
be
afraid
of
some
hideous
old
woman?
The
memory
of
that
foretelling
still
made
her
flesh
crawl
a
lifetime
later.
Jeyne
ran
shrieking
from
the
tent
in
fear,
the
queen
remembered,
but
Melara
stayed
and
so
did
I.
We
let
her
taste
our
blood,
and
laughed
at
her
stupid
prophecies.
None
of
them
made
the
least
bit
of
sense.
She
was
going
to
be
Prince
Rhaegar’s
wife,
no
matter
what
the
woman
said.
Her
father
had
promised
it,
and
Tywin
Lannister’s
word
was
gold.

Her
laughter
died
at
tourney’s
end.
There
had
been
no
final
feast,
no
toasts
to
celebrate
her
betrothal
to
Prince
Rhaegar.
Only
cold
silences
and
chilly
looks
between
the
king
and
her
father.
Later,
when
Aerys
and
his
son
and
all
his
gallant
knights
had
departed
for
King’s
Landing,
the
girl
had
gone
to
her
aunt
in
tears,
not
understanding.
“Your
father
proposed
the
match,”
Lady
Genna
told
her,
“but
Aerys
refused
to
hear
of
it.
‘You
are
my
most
able
servant,
Tywin,’
the
king
said,
‘but
a
man
does
not
marry
his
heir
to
his
servant’s
daughter.’
Dry
those
tears,
little
one.
Have
you
ever
seen
a
lion
weep?
Your
father
will
find
another
man
for
you,
a
better
man
than
Rhaegar.”

Her
aunt
had
lied,
though,
and
her
father
had
failed
her,
just
as
Jaime
was
failing
her
now.
Father
found
no
better
man.
Instead
he
gave
me
Robert,
and
Maggy’s
curse
bloomed
like
some
poisonous
flower.
If
she
had
only
married
Rhaegar
as
the
gods
intended,
he
would
never
have
looked
twice
at
the
wolf
girl.
Rhaegar
would
be
our
king
today
and
I
would
be
his
queen,
the
mother
of
his
sons.

She
had
never
forgiven
Robert
for
killing
him.

But
then,
lions
were
not
good
at
forgiving.
As
Ser
Bronn
of
the
Blackwater
would
shortly
learn.





BRIENNE

It
was
Hyle
Hunt
who
insisted
that
they
take
the
heads.
“Tarly
will
want
them
for
the
walls,”
he
said.

“We
have
no
tar,”
Brienne
pointed
out.
“The
flesh
will
rot.
Leave
them.”
She
did
not
want
to
travel
through
the
green
gloom
of
the
piney
woods
with
the
heads
of
the
men
she’d
killed.

Hunt
would
not
listen.
He
hacked
through
the
dead
men’s
necks
himself,
tied
the
three
heads
together
by
the
hair,
and
slung
them
from
his
saddle.
Brienne
had
no
choice
but
to
try
and
pretend
they
were
not
there,
but
sometimes,
especially
at
night,
she
could
feel
their
dead
eyes
on
her
back,
and
once
she
dreamed
she
heard
them
whispering
to
one
another.

It
was
cold
and
wet
on
Crackclaw
Point
as
they
retraced
their
steps.
Some
days
it
rained
and
some
days
it
threatened
rain.
They
were
never
warm.
Even
when
they
made
camp,
it
was
hard
to
find
enough
dry
wood
for
a
fire.

By
the
time
they
reached
the
gates
of
Maidenpool,
a
host
of
flies
attended
them,
a
crow
had
eaten
Shagwell’s
eyes,
and
Pyg
and
Timeon
were
crawling
with
maggots.
Brienne
and
Podrick
had
long
since
taken
to
riding
a
hundred
yards
ahead,
to
keep
the
smell
of
rot
well
behind
them.
Ser
Hyle
claimed
to
have
lost
all
sense
of
smell
by
then.
“Bury
them,”
she
told
him
every
time
they
made
camp
for
a
night,
but
Hunt
was
nothing
if
not
stubborn.
He
will
most
like
tell
Lord
Randyll
that
he
slew
all
three
of
them.

To
his
honor,
though,
the
knight
did
nothing
of
the
sort.

“The
stammering
squire
threw
a
rock,”
he
said,
when
he
and
Brienne
were
ushered
into
Tarly’s
presence
in
the
yard
of
Mooton’s
castle.
The
heads
had
been
presented
to
a
serjeant
of
the
guard,
who
was
told
to
have
them
cleaned
and
tarred
and
mounted
above
the
gate.
“The
swordswench
did
the
rest.”

“All
three?”
Lord
Randyll
was
incredulous.

“The
way
she
fought,
she
could
have
killed
three
more.”

“And
did
you
find
the
Stark
girl?”
Tarly
demanded
of
her.

“No,
my
lord.”

“Instead
you
slew
some
rats.
Did
you
enjoy
it?”

“No,
my
lord.”

“A
pity.
Well,
you’ve
had
your
taste
of
blood.
Proved
whatever
it
is
you
meant
to
prove.
It’s
time
you
took
off
that
mail
and
donned
proper
clothes
again.
There
are
ships
in
port.
One’s
bound
to
stop
at
Tarth.
I’ll
have
you
on
it.”

“Thank
you,
my
lord,
but
no.”

Lord
Tarly’s
face
suggested
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
stick
her
own
head
on
a
spike
and
mount
it
above
the
gates
of
Maidenpool
with
Timeon,
Pyg,
and
Shagwell.
“You
mean
to
continue
with
this
folly?”

“I
mean
to
find
the
Lady
Sansa.”

“If
it
please
my
lord,”
Ser
Hyle
said,
“I
watched
her
fight
the
Mummers.
She
is
stronger
than
most
men,
and
quick—”

“The
sword
is
quick,”
Tarly
snapped.
“That
is
the
nature
of
Valyrian
steel.
Stronger
than
most
men?
Aye.
She’s
a
freak
of
nature,
far
be
it
from
me
to
deny
it.”

His
sort
will
never
love
me,
Brienne
thought,
no
matter
what
I
do.
“My
lord,
it
may
be
that
Sandor
Clegane
has
some
knowledge
of
the
girl.
If
I
could
find
him...”

“Clegane’s
turned
outlaw.
He
rides
with
Beric
Dondarrion
now,
it
would
seem.
Or
not,
the
tales
vary.
Show
me
where
they’re
hiding,
I
will
gladly
slit
their
bellies
open,
pull
their
entrails
out,
and
burn
them.
We’ve
hanged
dozens
of
outlaws,
but
the
leaders
still
elude
us.
Clegane,
Dondarrion,
the
red
priest,
and
now
this
woman
Stoneheart...
how
do
you
propose
to
find
them,
when
I
cannot?”

“My
lord,
I...”
She
had
no
good
answer
for
him.
“All
I
can
do
is
try.”

“Try,
then.
You
have
your
letter,
you
do
not
need
my
leave,
but
I’ll
give
it
nonetheless.
If
you’re
fortunate,
all
you’ll
get
for
your
trouble
are
saddle
sores.
If
not,
perhaps
Clegane
will
let
you
live
after
he
and
his
pack
are
done
raping
you.
You
can
crawl
back
to
Tarth
with
some
dog’s
bastard
in
your
belly.”

Brienne
ignored
that.
“If
it
please
my
lord,
how
many
men
ride
with
the
Hound?”

“Six
or
sixty
or
six
hundred.
It
would
seem
to
depend
on
whom
we
ask.”
Randyll
Tarly
had
plainly
had
enough
of
the
conversation.
He
started
to
turn
away.

“If
my
squire
and
I
might
beg
your
hospitality
until—”

“Beg
all
you
want.
I
will
not
suffer
you
beneath
my
roof.”

Ser
Hyle
Hunt
stepped
forward.
“If
it
please
my
lord,
I
had
understood
that
it
was
still
Lord
Mooton’s
roof.”

Tarly
gave
the
knight
a
venomous
look.
“Mooton
has
the
courage
of
a
worm.
You
will
not
speak
to
me
of
Mooton.
As
for
you,
my
lady,
it
is
said
that
your
father
is
a
good
man.
If
so,
I
pity
him.
Some
men
are
blessed
with
sons,
some
with
daughters.
No
man
deserves
to
be
cursed
with
such
as
you.
Live
or
die,
Lady
Brienne,
do
not
return
to
Maidenpool
whilst
I
rule
here.”

Words
are
wind,
Brienne
told
herself.
They
cannot
hurt
you.
Let
them
wash
over
you.
“As
you
command,
my
lord,”
she
tried
to
say,
but
Tarly
had
gone
before
she
got
it
out.
She
walked
from
the
yard
like
one
asleep,
not
knowing
where
she
was
going.

Ser
Hyle
fell
in
beside
her.
“There
are
inns.”

She
shook
her
head.
She
did
not
want
words
with
Hyle
Hunt.

“Do
you
recall
the
Stinking
Goose?”

Her
cloak
still
smelled
of
it.
“Why?”

“Meet
me
there
on
the
morrow,
at
midday.
My
cousin
Alyn
was
one
of
those
sent
out
to
find
the
Hound.
I’ll
speak
with
him.”

“Why
would
you
do
that?”

“Why
not?
If
you
succeed
where
Alyn
failed,
I
shall
be
able
to
taunt
him
with
that
for
years.”

There
were
still
inns
in
Maidenpool;
Ser
Hyle
had
not
been
wrong.
Some
had
burned
during
one
sack
or
the
other,
however,
and
had
yet
to
be
rebuilt,
and
those
that
remained
were
full
to
bursting
with
men
from
Lord
Tarly’s
host.
She
and
Podrick
visited
all
of
them
that
afternoon,
but
there
were
no
beds
to
be
had
anywhere.

“Ser?
My
lady?”
Podrick
said
as
the
sun
was
going
down.
“There
are
ships.
Ships
have
beds.
Hammocks.
Or
bunks.”

Lord
Randyll’s
men
still
prowled
the
docks,
as
thick
as
the
flies
had
been
on
the
heads
of
the
three
Bloody
Mummers,
but
their
serjeant
knew
Brienne
by
sight
and
let
her
pass.
The
local
fisherfolk
were
tying
up
for
the
night
and
crying
the
day’s
catch,
but
her
interest
was
in
the
larger
ships
that
plied
the
stormy
waters
of
the
narrow
sea.
Half
a
dozen
were
in
port,
though
one,
a
galleas
called
the
Titan’s
Daughter,
was
casting
off
her
lines
to
ride
out
on
the
evening
tide.
She
and
Podrick
Payne
made
the
rounds
of
the
ships
that
remained.
The
master
of
the
Gulltown
Girl
took
Brienne
for
a
whore
and
told
them
that
his
ship
was
not
a
bawdy
house,
and
a
harpooner
on
the
Ibbenese
whaler
offered
to
buy
her
boy,
but
they
had
better
fortune
elsewhere.
She
purchased
Podrick
an
orange
on
the
Seastrider,
a
cog
just
in
from
Oldtown
by
way
of
Tyrosh,
Pentos,
and
Duskendale.
“Gulltown
next,”
her
captain
told
her,
“thence
around
the
Fingers
to
Sisterton
and
White
Harbor,
if
the
storms
allow.
She’s
a
clean
ship,
’Strider,
not
so
many
rats
as
most,
and
we’ll
have
fresh
eggs
and
new-churned
butter
aboard.
Is
m’lady
seeking
passage
north?”

“No.”
Not
yet.
She
was
tempted,
but...

As
they
were
making
their
way
to
the
next
pier,
Podrick
shuffled
his
feet,
and
said,
“Ser?
My
lady?
What
if
my
lady
did
go
home?
My
other
lady,
I
mean.
Ser.
Lady
Sansa.”

“They
burned
her
home.”

“Still.
That’s
where
her
gods
are.
And
gods
can’t
die.”

Gods
cannot
die,
but
girls
can.
“Timeon
was
a
cruel
man
and
a
murderer,
but
I
do
not
think
he
lied
about
the
Hound.
We
cannot
go
north
until
we
know
for
certain.
There
will
be
other
ships.”

At
the
east
end
of
the
harbor
they
finally
found
shelter
for
the
night,
aboard
a
storm-wracked
trading
galley
called
the
Lady
of
Myr.
She
was
listing
badly,
having
lost
her
mast
and
half
her
crew
in
a
storm,
but
her
master
did
not
have
the
coin
he
needed
to
refit
her,
so
he
was
glad
to
take
a
few
pennies
from
Brienne
and
allow
her
and
Pod
to
share
an
empty
cabin.

They
had
a
restless
night.
Thrice
Brienne
woke.
Once
when
the
rain
began,
and
once
at
a
creak
that
made
her
think
Nimble
Dick
was
creeping
in
to
kill
her.
The
second
time,
she
woke
with
knife
in
hand,
but
it
was
nothing.
In
the
darkness
of
the
cramped
little
cabin,
it
took
her
a
moment
to
remember
that
Nimble
Dick
was
dead.
When
she
finally
drifted
back
to
sleep,
she
dreamed
about
the
men
she’d
killed.
They
danced
around
her,
mocking
her,
pinching
at
her
as
she
slashed
at
them
with
her
sword.
She
cut
them
all
to
bloody
ribbons,
yet
still
they
swarmed
around
her...
Shagwell,
Timeon,
and
Pyg,
aye,
but
Randyll
Tarly
too,
and
Vargo
Hoat,
and
Red
Ronnet
Connington.
Ronnet
had
a
rose
between
his
fingers.
When
he
held
it
out
to
her,
she
cut
his
hand
off.

She
woke
sweating,
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
huddled
under
her
cloak,
listening
to
rain
pound
against
the
deck
over
her
head.
It
was
a
wild
night.
From
time
to
time
she
heard
the
sound
of
distant
thunder,
and
thought
of
the
Braavosi
ship
that
had
sailed
upon
the
evening
tide.

The
next
morning
she
found
the
Stinking
Goose
again,
woke
its
slatternly
proprietor,
and
paid
her
for
some
greasy
sausages,
fried
bread,
half
a
cup
of
wine,
a
flagon
of
boiled
water,
and
two
clean
cups.
The
woman
squinted
at
Brienne
as
she
was
putting
the
water
on
to
boil.
“You’re
the
big
one
went
off
with
Nimble
Dick.
I
remember.
He
cheat
you?”

“No.”

“Rape
you?”

“No.”

“Steal
your
horse?”

“No.
He
was
slain
by
outlaws.”

“Outlaws?”
The
woman
seemed
more
curious
than
upset.
“I
always
figured
Dick
would
hang,
or
get
sent
off
to
that
Wall.”

They
ate
the
fried
bread
and
half
the
sausages.
Podrick
Payne
washed
his
down
with
wine-flavored
water
whilst
Brienne
nursed
a
cup
of
watered
wine
and
wondered
why
she’d
come.
Hyle
Hunt
was
no
true
knight.
His
honest
face
was
just
a
mummer’s
mask.
I
do
not
need
his
help,
I
do
not
need
his
protection,
and
I
do
not
need
him,
she
told
herself.
He
is
probably
not
even
coming.
Telling
me
to
meet
him
here
was
just
another
jape.

She
was
getting
up
to
go
when
Ser
Hyle
arrived.
“My
lady.
Podrick.”
He
glanced
at
the
cups
and
plates
and
the
half-eaten
sausages
cooling
in
a
puddle
of
grease,
and
said,
“Gods,
I
hope
you
did
not
eat
the
food
here.”

“What
we
ate
is
no
concern
of
yours,”
Brienne
said.
“Did
you
find
your
cousin?
What
did
he
tell
you?”

“Sandor
Clegane
was
last
seen
in
Saltpans,
the
day
of
the
raid.
Afterward
he
rode
west,
along
the
Trident.”

She
frowned.
“The
Trident
is
a
long
river.”

“Aye,
but
I
don’t
think
our
dog
will
have
wandered
too
far
from
its
mouth.
Westeros
has
lost
its
charm
for
him,
it
would
seem.
At
Saltpans
he
was
looking
for
a
ship.”
Ser
Hyle
drew
a
roll
of
sheepskin
from
his
boot,
pushed
the
sausages
aside,
and
unrolled
it.
It
proved
to
be
a
map.
“The
Hound
butchered
three
of
his
brother’s
men
at
the
old
inn
by
the
crossroads,
here.
He
led
the
raid
on
Saltpans,
here.”
He
tapped
Saltpans
with
his
finger.
“He
may
be
trapped.
The
Freys
are
up
here
at
the
Twins,
Darry
and
Harrenhal
are
south
across
the
Trident,
west
he’s
got
the
Blackwoods
and
the
Brackens
fighting,
and
Lord
Randyll’s
here
at
Maidenpool.
The
high
road
to
the
Vale
is
closed
by
snow,
even
if
he
could
get
past
the
mountain
clans.
Where’s
a
dog
to
go?”

“If
he
is
with
Dondarrion...?”

“He’s
not.
Alyn
is
certain
of
that.
Dondarrion’s
men
are
looking
for
him
too.
They
have
put
out
word
that
they
mean
to
hang
him
for
what
he
did
at
Saltpans.
They
had
no
part
of
that.
Lord
Randyll
is
putting
it
about
that
they
did
in
hopes
of
turning
the
commons
against
Beric
and
his
brotherhood.
He
will
never
take
the
lightning
lord
so
long
as
the
smallfolk
are
protecting
him.
And
there’s
this
other
band,
led
by
this
woman
Stoneheart...
Lord
Beric’s
lover,
according
to
one
tale.
Supposedly
she
was
hanged
by
the
Freys,
but
Dondarrion
kissed
her
and
brought
her
back
to
life,
and
now
she
cannot
die,
no
more
than
he
can.”
Brienne
considered
the
map.
“If
Clegane
was
last
seen
at
Saltpans,
that
would
be
the
place
to
find
his
trail.”

“There
is
no
one
left
at
Saltpans
but
an
old
knight
hiding
in
his
castle,
Alyn
said.”

“Still,
it
would
be
a
place
to
start.”

“There’s
a
man,”
Ser
Hyle
said.
“A
septon.
He
came
in
through
my
gate
the
day
before
you
turned
up.
Meribald,
his
name
is.
River-born
and
river-bred
and
he’s
served
here
all
his
life.
He’s
departing
on
the
morrow
to
make
his
circuit,
and
he
always
calls
at
Saltpans.
We
should
go
with
him.”

Brienne
looked
up
sharply.
“We?”

“I
am
going
with
you.”

“You’re
not.”

“Well,
I’m
going
with
Septon
Meribald
to
Saltpans.
You
and
Podrick
can
go
wherever
you
bloody
well
like.”

“Did
Lord
Randyll
command
you
to
follow
me
again?”

“He
commanded
me
to
stay
away
from
you.
Lord
Randyll
is
of
the
view
that
you
might
benefit
from
a
good
hard
raping.”

“Then
why
would
you
come
with
me?”

“It
was
that,
or
return
to
gate
duty.”

“If
your
lord
commanded—”

“He
is
no
longer
my
lord.”

That
took
her
aback.
“You
left
his
service?”

“His
lordship
informed
me
that
he
had
no
further
need
of
my
sword,
or
my
insolence.
It
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
Henceforth
I
shall
enjoy
the
adventuresome
life
of
a
hedge
knight...
though
if
we
do
find
Sansa
Stark,
I
imagine
we
will
be
well
rewarded.”

Gold
and
land,
that’s
what
he
sees
in
this.
“I
mean
to
save
the
girl,
not
sell
her.
I
swore
a
vow.”

“I
don’t
recall
that
I
did.”

“That
is
why
you
will
not
be
coming
with
me.”

They
left
the
next
morning,
as
the
sun
was
coming
up.

It
was
a
queer
procession:
Ser
Hyle
on
a
chestnut
courser
and
Brienne
on
her
tall
grey
mare,
Podrick
Payne
astride
his
swayback
stot,
and
Septon
Meribald
walking
beside
them
with
his
quarterstaff,
leading
a
small
donkey
and
a
large
dog.
The
donkey
carried
such
a
heavy
load
that
Brienne
was
half
afraid
its
back
would
break.
“Food
for
the
poor
and
hungry
of
the
riverlands,”
Septon
Meribald
told
them
at
the
gates
of
Maidenpool.
“Seeds
and
nuts
and
dried
fruit,
oaten
porridge,
flour,
barley
bread,
three
wheels
of
yellow
cheese
from
the
inn
by
the
Fool’s
Gate,
salt
cod
for
me,
salt
mutton
for
Dog...
oh,
and
salt.
Onions,
carrots,
turnips,
two
sacks
of
beans,
four
of
barley,
and
nine
of
oranges.
I
have
a
weakness
for
the
orange,
I
confess.
I
got
these
from
a
sailor,
and
I
fear
they
will
be
the
last
I’ll
taste
till
spring.”

Meribald
was
a
septon
without
a
sept,
only
one
step
up
from
a
begging
brother
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
Faith.
There
were
hundreds
like
him,
a
ragged
band
whose
humble
task
it
was
to
trudge
from
one
flyspeck
of
a
village
to
the
next,
conducting
holy
services,
performing
marriages,
and
forgiving
sins.
Those
he
visited
were
expected
to
feed
and
shelter
him,
but
most
were
as
poor
as
he
was,
so
Meribald
could
not
linger
in
one
place
too
long
without
causing
hardship
to
his
hosts.
Kindly
innkeeps
would
sometimes
allow
him
to
sleep
in
their
kitchens
or
their
stables,
and
there
were
septries
and
holdfasts
and
even
a
few
castles
where
he
knew
he
would
be
given
hospitality.
Where
no
such
places
were
at
hand,
he
slept
beneath
the
trees
or
under
hedges.
“There
are
many
fine
hedges
in
the
riverlands,”
Meribald
said.
“The
old
ones
are
the
best.
There’s
nothing
beats
a
hundred-year-old
hedge.
Inside
one
of
those
a
man
can
sleep
as
snug
as
at
an
inn,
and
with
less
fear
of
fleas.”

The
septon
could
neither
read
nor
write,
as
he
cheerfully
confessed
along
the
road,
but
he
knew
a
hundred
different
prayers
and
could
recite
long
passages
from
The
Seven-Pointed
Star
from
memory,
which
was
all
that
was
required
in
the
villages.
He
had
a
seamed,
windburnt
face,
a
shock
of
thick
grey
hair,
wrinkles
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes.
Though
a
big
man,
six
feet
tall,
he
had
a
way
of
hunching
forward
as
he
walked
that
made
him
seem
much
shorter.
His
hands
were
large
and
leathery,
with
red
knuckles
and
dirt
beneath
the
nails,
and
he
had
the
biggest
feet
that
Brienne
had
ever
seen,
bare
and
black
and
hard
as
horn.

“I
have
not
worn
a
shoe
in
twenty
years,”
he
told
Brienne.
“The
first
year,
I
had
more
blisters
than
I
had
toes,
and
my
soles
would
bleed
like
pigs
whenever
I
trod
on
a
hard
stone,
but
I
prayed
and
the
Cobbler
Above
turned
my
skin
to
leather.”

“There
is
no
cobbler
above,”
Podrick
protested.

“There
is,
lad...
though
you
may
call
him
by
another
name.
Tell
me,
which
of
the
seven
gods
do
you
love
best?”

“The
Warrior,”
said
Podrick
without
a
moment’s
hesitation.

Brienne
cleared
her
throat.
“At
Evenfall
my
father’s
septon
always
said
that
there
was
but
one
god.”

“One
god
with
seven
aspects.
That’s
so,
my
lady,
and
you
are
right
to
point
it
out,
but
the
mystery
of
the
Seven
Who
Are
One
is
not
easy
for
simple
folk
to
grasp,
and
I
am
nothing
if
not
simple,
so
I
speak
of
seven
gods.”
Meribald
turned
back
to
Podrick.
“I
have
never
known
a
boy
who
did
not
love
the
Warrior.
I
am
old,
though,
and
being
old,
I
love
the
Smith.
Without
his
labor,
what
would
the
Warrior
defend?
Every
town
has
a
smith,
and
every
castle.
They
make
the
plows
we
need
to
plant
our
crops,
the
nails
we
use
to
build
our
ships,
iron
shoes
to
save
the
hooves
of
our
faithful
horses,
the
bright
swords
of
our
lords.
No
one
could
doubt
the
value
of
a
smith,
and
so
we
name
one
of
the
Seven
in
his
honor,
but
we
might
as
easily
have
called
him
the
Farmer
or
the
Fisherman,
the
Carpenter
or
the
Cobbler.
What
he
works
at
makes
no
matter.
What
matters
is,
he
works.
The
Father
rules,
the
Warrior
fights,
the
Smith
labors,
and
together
they
perform
all
that
is
rightful
for
a
man.
Just
as
the
Smith
is
one
aspect
of
the
godhead,
the
Cobbler
is
one
aspect
of
the
Smith.
It
was
he
who
heard
my
prayer
and
healed
my
feet.”

“The
gods
are
good,”
Ser
Hyle
said
in
a
dry
voice,
“but
why
trouble
them,
when
you
might
just
have
kept
your
shoes?”

“Going
barefoot
was
my
penance.
Even
holy
septons
can
be
sinners,
and
my
flesh
was
weak
as
weak
could
be.
I
was
young
and
full
of
sap,
and
the
girls...
a
septon
can
seem
as
gallant
as
a
prince
if
he
is
the
only
man
you
know
who
has
ever
been
more
than
a
mile
from
your
village.
I
would
recite
to
them
from
The
Seven-Pointed
Star.
The
Maiden’s
Book
worked
best.
Oh,
I
was
a
wicked
man,
before
I
threw
away
my
shoes.
It
shames
me
to
think
of
all
the
maidens
I
deflowered.”

Brienne
shifted
in
the
saddle
uncomfortably,
thinking
back
to
the
camp
below
the
walls
of
Highgarden
and
the
wager
Ser
Hyle
and
the
others
had
made
to
see
who
could
bed
her
first.

“We’re
looking
for
a
maiden,”
confided
Podrick
Payne.
“A
highborn
girl
of
three-and-ten,
with
auburn
hair.”

“I
had
understood
that
you
were
seeking
outlaws.”

“Them
too,”
Podrick
admitted.

“Most
travelers
do
all
they
can
to
avoid
such
men,”
said
Septon
Meribald,
“yet
you
would
seek
them
out.”

“We
only
seek
one
outlaw,”
Brienne
said.
“The
Hound.”

“So
Ser
Hyle
told
me.
May
the
Seven
save
you,
child.
It’s
said
he
leaves
a
trail
of
butchered
babes
and
ravished
maids
behind
him.
The
Mad
Dog
of
Saltpans,
I
have
heard
him
called.
What
would
good
folk
want
with
such
a
creature?”

“The
maid
that
Podrick
spoke
of
may
be
with
him.”

“Truly?
Then
we
must
pray
for
the
poor
girl.”

And
for
me,
thought
Brienne,
a
prayer
for
me
as
well.
Ask
the
Crone
to
raise
her
lamp
and
lead
me
to
the
Lady
Sansa,
and
the
Warrior
to
give
strength
to
my
arm
so
that
I
might
defend
her.
She
did
not
say
the
words
aloud,
though;
not
where
Hyle
Hunt
might
hear
her
and
mock
her
for
her
woman’s
weakness.

With
Septon
Meribald
afoot
and
his
donkey
bearing
such
a
heavy
load,
the
going
was
slow
all
that
day.
They
did
not
take
the
main
road
west,
the
road
that
Brienne
had
once
ridden
with
Ser
Jaime
when
they
came
the
other
way
to
find
Maidenpool
sacked
and
full
of
corpses.
Instead
they
struck
off
toward
the
northwest,
following
the
shore
of
the
Bay
of
Crabs
on
a
crooked
track
so
small
that
it
did
not
appear
on
either
of
Ser
Hyle’s
precious
sheepskin
maps.
The
steep
hills,
black
bogs,
and
piney
woods
of
Crackclaw
Point
were
nowhere
to
be
found
this
side
of
Maidenpool.
The
lands
they
traveled
through
were
low
and
wet,
a
wilderness
of
sandy
dunes
and
salt
marshes
beneath
a
vast
blue-grey
vault
of
sky.
The
road
was
prone
to
vanishing
amongst
the
reeds
and
tidal
pools,
only
to
appear
again
a
mile
farther
on;
without
Meribald,
Brienne
knew,
they
surely
would
have
lost
their
way.
The
ground
was
often
soft,
so
in
places
the
septon
would
walk
ahead,
tapping
with
his
quarterstaff
to
make
certain
of
the
footing.
There
were
no
trees
for
leagues
around,
just
sea
and
sky
and
sand.

No
land
could
have
been
more
different
from
Tarth,
with
its
mountains
and
waterfalls,
its
high
meadows
and
shadowed
vales,
yet
this
place
had
its
own
beauty,
Brienne
thought.
They
crossed
a
dozen
slow-flowing
streams
alive
with
frogs
and
crickets,
watched
terns
floating
high
above
the
bay,
heard
the
sandpipers
calling
from
amongst
the
dunes.
Once
a
fox
crossed
their
path,
and
set
Meribald’s
dog
to
barking
wildly.

And
there
were
people
too.
Some
lived
amongst
the
reeds
in
houses
built
of
mud
and
straw,
whilst
others
fished
the
bay
in
leather
coracles
and
built
their
homes
on
rickety
wooden
stilts
above
the
dunes.
Most
seemed
to
live
alone,
out
of
sight
of
any
human
habitation
but
their
own.
They
seemed
a
shy
folk
for
the
most
part,
but
near
midday
the
dog
began
to
bark
again,
and
three
women
emerged
from
the
reeds
to
give
Meribald
a
woven
basket
full
of
clams.
He
gave
each
of
them
an
orange
in
return,
though
clams
were
as
common
as
mud
in
this
world,
and
oranges
were
rare
and
costly.
One
of
the
women
was
very
old,
one
was
heavy
with
child,
and
one
was
a
girl
as
fresh
and
pretty
as
a
flower
in
spring.
When
Meribald
took
them
off
to
hear
their
sins,
Ser
Hyle
chuckled,
and
said,
“It
would
seem
the
gods
walk
with
us...
at
least
the
Maiden,
the
Mother,
and
the
Crone.”
Podrick
looked
so
astonished
that
Brienne
had
to
tell
him
no,
they
were
only
three
marsh
women.

Afterward,
when
they
resumed
their
journey,
she
turned
to
the
septon,
and
said,
“These
people
live
less
than
a
day’s
ride
from
Maidenpool,
and
yet
the
fighting
has
not
touched
them.”

“They
have
little
to
touch,
my
lady.
Their
treasures
are
shells
and
stones
and
leather
boats,
their
finest
weapons
knives
of
rusted
iron.
They
are
born,
they
live,
they
love,
they
die.
They
know
Lord
Mooton
rules
their
lands,
but
few
have
ever
seen
him,
and
Riverrun
and
King’s
Landing
are
only
names
to
them.”

“And
yet
they
know
the
gods,”
said
Brienne.
“That
is
your
work,
I
think.
How
long
have
you
walked
the
riverlands?”

“It
will
be
forty
years
soon,”
the
septon
said,
and
his
dog
gave
a
loud
bark.
“From
Maidenpool
to
Maidenpool,
my
circuit
takes
me
half
a
year
and
ofttimes
more,
but
I
will
not
say
I
know
the
Trident.
I
glimpse
the
castles
of
the
great
lords
only
at
a
distance,
but
I
know
the
market
towns
and
holdfasts,
the
villages
too
small
to
have
a
name,
the
hedges
and
the
hills,
the
rills
where
a
thirsty
man
can
drink
and
the
caves
where
he
can
shelter.
And
the
roads
the
smallfolk
use,
the
crooked
muddy
tracks
that
do
not
appear
on
parchment
maps,
I
know
them
too.”
He
chuckled.
“I
should.
My
feet
have
trod
every
mile
of
them,
ten
times
over.”

The
back
roads
are
the
ones
the
outlaws
use,
and
the
caves
would
make
fine
places
for
hunted
men
to
hide.
A
prickle
of
suspicion
made
Brienne
wonder
just
how
well
Ser
Hyle
knew
this
man.
“It
must
make
for
a
lonely
life,
septon.”

“The
Seven
are
always
with
me,”
said
Meribald,
“and
I
have
my
faithful
servant,
and
Dog.”

“Does
your
dog
have
a
name?”
asked
Podrick
Payne.

“He
must,”
said
Meribald,
“but
he
is
not
my
dog.
Not
him.”

The
dog
barked
and
wagged
his
tail.
He
was
a
huge,
shaggy
creature,
ten
stone
of
dog
at
least,
but
friendly.

“Who
does
he
belong
to?”
asked
Podrick.

“Why,
to
himself,
and
to
the
Seven.
As
to
his
name,
he
has
not
told
me
what
it
is.
I
call
him
Dog.”

“Oh.”
Podrick
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
a
dog
named
Dog,
plainly.
The
boy
chewed
on
that
a
while,
then
said,
“I
used
to
have
a
dog
when
I
was
little.
I
called
him
Hero.”

“Was
he?”

“Was
he
what?”

“A
hero.”

“No.
He
was
a
good
dog,
though.
He
died.”

“Dog
keeps
me
safe
upon
the
roads,
even
in
such
trying
times
as
these.
Neither
wolf
nor
outlaw
dare
molest
me
when
Dog
is
at
my
side.”
The
septon
frowned.
“The
wolves
have
grown
terrible
of
late.
There
are
places
where
a
man
alone
would
do
well
to
find
a
tree
to
sleep
in.
In
all
my
years
the
biggest
pack
I
ever
saw
had
fewer
than
a
dozen
wolves
in
it,
but
the
great
pack
that
prowls
along
the
Trident
now
numbers
in
the
hundreds.”

“Have
you
come
on
them
yourself?”
Ser
Hyle
asked.

“I
have
been
spared
that,
Seven
save
me,
but
I
have
heard
them
in
the
night,
and
more
than
once.
So
many
voices...
a
sound
to
curdle
a
man’s
blood.
It
even
set
Dog
to
shivering,
and
Dog
has
killed
a
dozen
wolves.”
He
ruffled
the
dog’s
head.
“Some
will
tell
you
that
they
are
demons.
They
say
the
pack
is
led
by
a
monstrous
she-wolf,
a
stalking
shadow
grim
and
grey
and
huge.
They
will
tell
you
that
she
has
been
known
to
bring
aurochs
down
all
by
herself,
that
no
trap
nor
snare
can
hold
her,
that
she
fears
neither
steel
nor
fire,
slays
any
wolf
that
tries
to
mount
her,
and
devours
no
other
flesh
but
man.”

Ser
Hyle
Hunt
laughed.
“Now
you’ve
done
it,
septon.
Poor
Podrick’s
eyes
are
big
as
boiled
eggs.”

“They’re
not,”
said
Podrick,
indignant.
Dog
barked.

That
night
they
made
a
cold
camp
in
the
dunes.
Brienne
sent
Podrick
walking
by
the
shore
to
find
some
driftwood
for
a
fire,
but
he
came
back
empty-handed,
with
mud
up
to
his
knees.
“The
tide’s
out,
ser.
My
lady.
There’s
no
water,
only
mudflats.”

“Stay
off
the
mud,
child,”
counseled
Septon
Meribald.
“The
mud
is
not
fond
of
strangers.
If
you
walk
in
the
wrong
place,
it
will
open
up
and
swallow
you.”

“It’s
only
mud,”
insisted
Podrick.

“Until
it
fills
your
mouth
and
starts
creeping
up
your
nose.
Then
it’s
death.”
He
smiled
to
take
the
chill
off
his
words.
“Wipe
off
that
mud
and
have
a
slice
of
orange,
lad.”

The
next
day
was
more
of
the
same.
They
broke
their
fast
on
salt
cod
and
more
orange
slices,
and
were
on
their
way
before
the
sun
was
wholly
risen,
with
a
pink
sky
behind
them
and
a
purple
sky
ahead.
Dog
led
the
way,
sniffing
at
every
clump
of
reeds
and
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
piss
on
one;
he
seemed
to
know
the
road
as
well
as
Meribald.
The
cries
of
terns
shivered
through
the
morning
air
as
the
tide
came
rushing
in.

Near
midday
they
stopped
at
a
tiny
village,
the
first
they
had
encountered,
where
eight
of
the
stilt-houses
loomed
above
a
small
stream.
The
men
were
out
fishing
in
their
coracles,
but
the
women
and
young
boys
clambered
down
dangling
rope
ladders
and
gathered
around
Septon
Meribald
to
pray.
After
the
service
he
absolved
their
sins
and
left
them
with
some
turnips,
a
sack
of
beans,
and
two
of
his
precious
oranges.

Back
on
the
road,
the
septon
said,
“We
would
do
well
to
keep
a
watch
tonight,
my
friends.
The
villagers
say
they’ve
seen
three
broken
men
skulking
round
the
dunes,
west
of
the
old
watchtower.”

“Only
three?”
Ser
Hyle
smiled.
“Three
is
honey
to
our
swordswench.
They’re
not
like
to
trouble
armed
men.”

“Unless
they’re
starving,”
the
septon
said.
“There
is
food
in
these
marshes,
but
only
for
those
with
the
eyes
to
find
it,
and
these
men
are
strangers
here,
survivors
from
some
battle.
If
they
should
accost
us,
ser,
I
beg
you,
leave
them
to
me.”

“What
will
you
do
with
them?”

“Feed
them.
Ask
them
to
confess
their
sins,
so
that
I
might
forgive
them.
Invite
them
to
come
with
us
to
the
Quiet
Isle.”

“That’s
as
good
as
inviting
them
to
slit
our
throats
as
we
sleep,”
Hyle
Hunt
replied.
“Lord
Randyll
has
better
ways
to
deal
with
broken
men—steel
and
hempen
rope.”

“Ser?
My
lady?”
said
Podrick.
“Is
a
broken
man
an
outlaw?”

“More
or
less,”
Brienne
answered.

Septon
Meribald
disagreed.
“More
less
than
more.
There
are
many
sorts
of
outlaws,
just
as
there
are
many
sorts
of
birds.
A
sandpiper
and
a
sea
eagle
both
have
wings,
but
they
are
not
the
same.
The
singers
love
to
sing
of
good
men
forced
to
go
outside
the
law
to
fight
some
wicked
lord,
but
most
outlaws
are
more
like
this
ravening
Hound
than
they
are
the
lightning
lord.
They
are
evil
men,
driven
by
greed,
soured
by
malice,
despising
the
gods
and
caring
only
for
themselves.
Broken
men
are
more
deserving
of
our
pity,
though
they
may
be
just
as
dangerous.
Almost
all
are
common-born,
simple
folk
who
had
never
been
more
than
a
mile
from
the
house
where
they
were
born
until
the
day
some
lord
came
round
to
take
them
off
to
war.
Poorly
shod
and
poorly
clad,
they
march
away
beneath
his
banners,
ofttimes
with
no
better
arms
than
a
sickle
or
a
sharpened
hoe,
or
a
maul
they
made
themselves
by
lashing
a
stone
to
a
stick
with
strips
of
hide.
Brothers
march
with
brothers,
sons
with
fathers,
friends
with
friends.
They’ve
heard
the
songs
and
stories,
so
they
go
off
with
eager
hearts,
dreaming
of
the
wonders
they
will
see,
of
the
wealth
and
glory
they
will
win.
War
seems
a
fine
adventure,
the
greatest
most
of
them
will
ever
know.

“Then
they
get
a
taste
of
battle.

“For
some,
that
one
taste
is
enough
to
break
them.
Others
go
on
for
years,
until
they
lose
count
of
all
the
battles
they
have
fought
in,
but
even
a
man
who
has
survived
a
hundred
fights
can
break
in
his
hundred-and-first.
Brothers
watch
their
brothers
die,
fathers
lose
their
sons,
friends
see
their
friends
trying
to
hold
their
entrails
in
after
they’ve
been
gutted
by
an
axe.

“They
see
the
lord
who
led
them
there
cut
down,
and
some
other
lord
shouts
that
they
are
his
now.
They
take
a
wound,
and
when
that’s
still
half-healed
they
take
another.
There
is
never
enough
to
eat,
their
shoes
fall
to
pieces
from
the
marching,
their
clothes
are
torn
and
rotting,
and
half
of
them
are
shitting
in
their
breeches
from
drinking
bad
water.

“If
they
want
new
boots
or
a
warmer
cloak
or
maybe
a
rusted
iron
halfhelm,
they
need
to
take
them
from
a
corpse,
and
before
long
they
are
stealing
from
the
living
too,
from
the
smallfolk
whose
lands
they’re
fighting
in,
men
very
like
the
men
they
used
to
be.
They
slaughter
their
sheep
and
steal
their
chickens,
and
from
there
it’s
just
a
short
step
to
carrying
off
their
daughters
too.
And
one
day
they
look
around
and
realize
all
their
friends
and
kin
are
gone,
that
they
are
fighting
beside
strangers
beneath
a
banner
that
they
hardly
recognize.
They
don’t
know
where
they
are
or
how
to
get
back
home
and
the
lord
they’re
fighting
for
does
not
know
their
names,
yet
here
he
comes,
shouting
for
them
to
form
up,
to
make
a
line
with
their
spears
and
scythes
and
sharpened
hoes,
to
stand
their
ground.
And
the
knights
come
down
on
them,
faceless
men
clad
all
in
steel,
and
the
iron
thunder
of
their
charge
seems
to
fill
the
world...

“And
the
man
breaks.

“He
turns
and
runs,
or
crawls
off
afterward
over
the
corpses
of
the
slain,
or
steals
away
in
the
black
of
night,
and
he
finds
someplace
to
hide.
All
thought
of
home
is
gone
by
then,
and
kings
and
lords
and
gods
mean
less
to
him
than
a
haunch
of
spoiled
meat
that
will
let
him
live
another
day,
or
a
skin
of
bad
wine
that
might
drown
his
fear
for
a
few
hours.
The
broken
man
lives
from
day
to
day,
from
meal
to
meal,
more
beast
than
man.
Lady
Brienne
is
not
wrong.
In
times
like
these,
the
traveler
must
beware
of
broken
men,
and
fear
them...
but
he
should
pity
them
as
well.”

When
Meribald
was
finished
a
profound
silence
fell
upon
their
little
band.
Brienne
could
hear
the
wind
rustling
through
a
clump
of
pussywillows,
and
farther
off
the
faint
cry
of
a
loon.
She
could
hear
Dog
panting
softly
as
he
loped
along
beside
the
septon
and
his
donkey,
tongue
lolling
from
his
mouth.
The
quiet
stretched
and
stretched,
until
finally
she
said,
“How
old
were
you
when
they
marched
you
off
to
war?”

“Why,
no
older
than
your
boy,”
Meribald
replied.
“Too
young
for
such,
in
truth,
but
my
brothers
were
all
going,
and
I
would
not
be
left
behind.
Willam
said
I
could
be
his
squire,
though
Will
was
no
knight,
only
a
potboy
armed
with
a
kitchen
knife
he’d
stolen
from
the
inn.
He
died
upon
the
Stepstones,
and
never
struck
a
blow.
It
was
fever
did
for
him,
and
for
my
brother
Robin.
Owen
died
from
a
mace
that
split
his
head
apart,
and
his
friend
Jon
Pox
was
hanged
for
rape.”

“The
War
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings?”
asked
Hyle
Hunt.

“So
they
called
it,
though
I
never
saw
a
king,
nor
earned
a
penny.
It
was
a
war,
though.
That
it
was.”





SAMWELL

Sam
stood
before
the
window,
rocking
nervously
as
he
watched
the
last
light
of
the
sun
vanish
behind
a
row
of
sharp-peaked
rooftops.
He
must
have
gotten
drunk
again,
he
thought
glumly.
Or
else
he’s
met
another
girl.
He
did
not
know
whether
to
curse
or
weep.
Dareon
was
supposed
to
be
his
brother.
Ask
him
to
sing,
and
no
one
could
be
better.
Ask
him
to
do
aught
else...

The
mists
of
evening
had
begun
to
rise,
sending
grey
fingers
up
the
walls
of
the
buildings
that
lined
the
old
canal.
“He
promised
he’d
be
back,”
Sam
said.
“You
heard
him
too.”

Gilly
looked
at
him
with
eyes
red-rimmed
and
puffy.
Her
hair
hung
about
her
face,
unwashed
and
tangled.
She
looked
like
some
wary
animal
peering
through
a
bush.
It
had
been
days
since
they’d
last
had
a
fire,
yet
the
wildling
girl
liked
to
huddle
near
the
hearth,
as
if
the
cold
ashes
still
held
some
lingering
warmth.
“He
doesn’t
like
it
here
with
us,”
she
said,
whispering
so
as
not
to
wake
the
babe.
“It’s
sad
here.
He
likes
it
where
the
wine
is,
and
the
smiles.”

Yes,
thought
Sam,
and
the
wine
is
everywhere
but
here.
Braavos
was
full
of
inns,
alehouses,
and
brothels.
And
if
Dareon
preferred
a
fire
and
a
cup
of
mulled
wine
to
stale
bread
and
the
company
of
a
weeping
woman,
a
fat
craven,
and
a
sick
old
man,
who
could
blame
him?
I
could
blame
him.
He
said
he
would
be
back
before
the
gloaming;
he
said
he
would
bring
us
wine
and
food.

He
looked
out
the
window
once
more,
hoping
against
hope
to
see
the
singer
hurrying
home.
Darkness
was
falling
across
the
secret
city,
creeping
through
the
alleys
and
down
the
canals.
The
good
folk
of
Braavos
would
soon
be
shuttering
their
windows
and
sliding
bars
across
their
doors.
Night
belonged
to
the
bravos
and
the
courtesans.
Dareon’s
new
friends,
Sam
thought
bitterly.
They
were
all
the
singer
could
talk
about
of
late.
He
was
trying
to
write
a
song
about
one
courtesan,
a
woman
called
the
Moonshadow
who
had
heard
him
singing
beside
the
Moon
Pool
and
rewarded
him
with
a
kiss.
“You
should
have
asked
her
for
silver,”
Sam
had
said.
“It’s
coin
we
need,
not
kisses.”
But
the
singer
only
smiled.
“Some
kisses
are
worth
more
than
yellow
gold,
Slayer.”

That
made
him
angry
too.
Dareon
was
not
supposed
to
be
making
up
songs
about
courtesans.
He
was
supposed
to
be
singing
about
the
Wall
and
the
valor
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Jon
had
hoped
that
perhaps
his
songs
might
persuade
a
few
young
men
to
take
the
black.
Instead
he
sang
of
golden
kisses,
silvery
hair,
and
red,
red
lips.
No
one
ever
took
the
black
for
red,
red
lips.

Sometimes
his
playing
would
wake
the
babe
too.
Then
the
child
would
begin
to
wail,
Dareon
would
shout
at
him
to
be
quiet,
Gilly
would
weep,
and
the
singer
would
storm
out
and
not
return
for
days.
“All
that
weeping
makes
me
want
to
slap
her,”
he
complained,
“and
I
can
scarce
sleep
for
her
sobbing.”

You
would
weep
as
well
if
you
had
a
son
and
lost
him,
Sam
almost
said.
He
could
not
blame
Gilly
for
her
grief.
Instead,
he
blamed
Jon
Snow
and
wondered
when
Jon’s
heart
had
turned
to
stone.
Once
he
asked
Maester
Aemon
that
very
question,
when
Gilly
was
down
at
the
canal
fetching
water
for
them.
“When
you
raised
him
up
to
be
the
lord
commander,”
the
old
man
answered.

Even
now,
rotting
here
in
this
cold
room
beneath
the
eaves,
part
of
Sam
did
not
want
to
believe
that
Jon
had
done
what
Maester
Aemon
thought.
It
must
be
true,
though.
Why
else
would
Gilly
weep
so
much?
All
he
had
to
do
was
ask
her
whose
child
she
was
nursing
at
her
breast,
but
he
did
not
have
the
courage.
He
was
afraid
of
the
answer
he
might
get.
I
am
still
a
craven,
Jon.
No
matter
where
he
went
in
this
wide
world,
his
fears
went
with
him.

A
hollow
rumbling
echoed
off
the
roofs
of
Braavos,
like
the
sound
of
distant
thunder;
the
Titan,
sounding
nightfall
from
across
the
lagoon.
The
noise
was
loud
enough
to
wake
the
babe,
and
his
sudden
wail
woke
Maester
Aemon.
As
Gilly
went
to
give
the
boy
the
breast,
the
old
man’s
eyes
opened,
and
he
stirred
feebly
in
his
narrow
bed.
“Egg?
It’s
dark.
Why
is
it
so
dark?”

Because
you’re
blind.
Aemon’s
wits
were
wandering
more
and
more
since
they
arrived
at
Braavos.
Some
days
he
did
not
seem
to
know
where
he
was.
Some
days
he
would
lose
his
way
when
saying
something
and
begin
to
ramble
on
about
his
father
or
his
brother.
He
is
one
hundred
and
two,
Sam
reminded
himself,
but
he
had
been
just
as
old
at
Castle
Black
and
his
wits
had
never
wandered
there.

“It’s
me,”
he
had
to
say.
“Samwell
Tarly.
Your
steward.”

“Sam.”
Maester
Aemon
licked
his
lips,
and
blinked.
“Yes.
And
this
is
Braavos.
Forgive
me,
Sam.
Is
morning
come?”

“No.”
Sam
felt
the
old
man’s
brow.
His
skin
was
damp
with
sweat,
cool
and
clammy
to
the
touch,
his
every
breath
a
soft
wheeze.
“It’s
night,
maester.
You’ve
been
asleep.”

“Too
long.
It’s
cold
in
here.”

“We
have
no
wood,”
Sam
told
him,
“and
the
innkeep
will
not
give
us
more
unless
we
have
the
coin.”
It
was
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
they’d
had
this
same
conversation.
I
should
have
used
our
coin
for
wood,
Sam
chided
himself
every
time.
I
should
have
had
the
sense
to
keep
him
warm.

Instead
he
had
squandered
the
last
of
their
silver
on
a
healer
from
the
House
of
the
Red
Hands,
a
tall
pale
man
in
robes
embroidered
with
swirling
stripes
of
red
and
white.
All
that
the
silver
bought
him
was
half
a
flask
of
dreamwine.
“This
may
help
gentle
his
passing,”
the
Braavosi
had
said,
not
unkindly.
When
Sam
asked
if
there
wasn’t
any
more
that
he
could
do,
he
shook
his
head.
“Ointments
I
have,
potions
and
infusions,
tinctures
and
venoms
and
poultices.
I
might
bleed
him,
purge
him,
leech
him...
but
why?
No
leech
can
make
him
young
again.
This
is
an
old
man,
and
death
is
in
his
lungs.
Give
him
this
and
let
him
sleep.”

And
so
he
had,
all
night
and
all
day,
but
now
the
old
man
was
struggling
to
sit.
“We
must
go
down
to
the
ships.”

The
ships
again.
“You’re
too
weak
to
go
out,”
he
had
to
say.
A
chill
had
gotten
inside
Maester
Aemon
during
the
voyage
and
settled
in
his
chest.
By
the
time
they
got
to
Braavos,
he
had
been
so
weak
they’d
had
to
carry
him
ashore.
They’d
still
had
a
fat
bag
of
silver
then,
so
Dareon
had
asked
for
the
inn’s
biggest
bed.
The
one
they’d
gotten
was
large
enough
to
sleep
eight,
so
the
innkeep
insisted
on
charging
them
for
that
many.

“On
the
morrow
we
can
go
to
the
docks,”
Sam
promised.
“You
can
ask
about
and
find
which
ship
is
departing
next
for
Oldtown.”
Even
in
autumn,
Braavos
was
still
a
busy
port.
Once
Aemon
was
strong
enough
to
travel,
they
should
have
no
trouble
finding
a
suitable
vessel
to
take
them
where
they
had
to
go.
Paying
for
their
passage
would
prove
more
difficult.
A
ship
from
the
Seven
Kingdoms
would
be
their
best
hope.
A
trader
out
of
Oldtown,
maybe,
with
kin
in
the
Night’s
Watch.
There
must
still
be
some
who
honor
the
men
who
walk
the
Wall.

“Oldtown,”
Maester
Aemon
wheezed.
“Yes.
I
dreamt
of
Oldtown,
Sam.
I
was
young
again
and
my
brother
Egg
was
with
me,
with
that
big
knight
he
served.
We
were
drinking
in
the
old
inn
where
they
make
the
fearsomely
strong
cider.”
He
tried
to
rise
again,
but
the
effort
proved
too
much
for
him.
After
a
moment
he
settled
back.
“The
ships,”
he
said
again.
“We
will
find
our
answer
there.
About
the
dragons.
I
need
to
know.”

No,
thought
Sam,
it’s
food
and
warmth
you
need,
a
full
belly
and
a
hot
fire
crackling
in
the
hearth.
“Are
you
hungry,
maester?
We
have
some
bread
left,
and
a
bit
of
cheese.”

“Not
just
now,
Sam.
Later,
when
I’m
feeling
stronger.”

“How
will
you
get
stronger
unless
you
eat?”
None
of
them
had
eaten
much
at
sea,
not
after
Skagos.
The
autumn
gales
had
hounded
them
all
across
the
narrow
sea.
Sometimes
they
came
up
from
the
south,
roiling
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
black
rains
that
fell
for
days.
Sometimes
they
came
down
from
the
north,
cold
and
grim,
with
savage
winds
that
cut
right
through
a
man.
Once
it
got
so
cold
that
Sam
had
woken
to
find
the
whole
ship
coated
in
ice,
shining
as
white
as
pearl.
The
captain
had
taken
down
their
mast
and
tied
it
to
the
deck,
to
finish
the
crossing
on
oars
alone.
No
one
had
been
eating
by
the
time
they
saw
the
Titan.

Once
safe
ashore,
though,
Sam
had
found
himself
ravenously
hungry.
It
was
the
same
for
Dareon
and
Gilly.
Even
the
babe
had
begun
to
suck
more
lustily.
Aemon,
though...

“The
bread’s
gone
stale,
but
I
can
beg
some
gravy
from
the
kitchens
to
soak
it
in,”
Sam
told
the
old
man.
The
innkeep
was
a
hard
man,
cold-eyed
and
suspicious
of
these
black-clad
strangers
beneath
his
roof,
but
his
cook
was
kinder.

“No.
Perhaps
a
sip
of
wine,
though?”

They
had
no
wine.
Dareon
had
promised
to
buy
some
with
the
coin
from
his
singing.
“We’ll
have
wine
later,”
Sam
had
to
say.
“There’s
water,
but
it’s
not
the
good
water.”
The
good
water
came
over
the
arches
of
the
great
brick
aqueduct
the
Braavosi
called
the
sweetwater
river.
Rich
men
had
it
piped
into
their
homes;
the
poor
filled
their
pails
and
buckets
at
public
fountains.
Sam
had
sent
Gilly
out
to
get
some,
forgetting
that
the
wildling
girl
had
lived
her
whole
life
in
sight
of
Craster’s
Keep
and
never
seen
so
much
as
a
market
town.
The
stony
maze
of
islands
and
canals
that
was
Braavos,
devoid
of
grass
and
trees
and
teeming
with
strangers
who
spoke
to
her
in
words
she
could
not
understand,
frightened
her
so
badly
that
she
lost
the
map
and
soon
herself.
Sam
found
her
weeping
at
the
stony
feet
of
some
long-dead
sealord.
“All
we
have
is
canal
water,”
he
told
Maester
Aemon,
“but
the
cook
gave
it
a
boil.
There’s
dreamwine
too,
if
you
need
more
of
that.”

“I
have
dreamt
enough
for
now.
Canal
water
will
suffice.
Help
me,
if
you
would.”

Sam
eased
the
old
man
up
and
held
the
cup
to
his
dry,
cracked
lips.
Even
so,
half
the
water
dribbled
down
the
maester’s
chest.
“Enough,”
Aemon
coughed,
after
a
few
sips.
“You’ll
drown
me.”
He
shivered
in
Sam’s
arms.
“Why
is
the
room
so
cold?”

“There’s
no
more
wood.”
Dareon
had
paid
the
innkeep
double
for
a
room
with
a
hearth,
but
none
of
them
had
realized
that
wood
would
be
so
costly
here.
Trees
did
not
grow
on
Braavos,
save
in
the
courts
and
gardens
of
the
mighty.
Nor
would
the
Braavosi
cut
the
pines
that
covered
the
outlying
islands
around
their
great
lagoon
and
acted
as
windbreaks
to
shield
them
from
storms.
Instead,
firewood
was
brought
in
by
barge,
up
the
rivers
and
across
the
lagoon.
Even
dung
was
dear
here;
the
Braavosi
used
boats
in
place
of
horses.
None
of
that
would
have
mattered
if
they
had
departed
as
planned
for
Oldtown,
but
that
had
proved
impossible
with
Maester
Aemon
so
weak.
Another
voyage
on
the
open
sea
would
kill
him.

Aemon’s
hand
crept
across
the
blankets,
groping
for
Sam’s
arm.
“We
must
go
to
the
docks,
Sam.”

“When
you
are
stronger.”
The
old
man
was
in
no
state
to
brave
the
salt
spray
and
wet
winds
along
the
waterfront,
and
Braavos
was
all
waterfront.
To
the
north
was
the
Purple
Harbor,
where
Braavosi
traders
tied
up
beneath
the
domes
and
towers
of
the
Sealord’s
Palace.
To
the
west
lay
the
Ragman’s
Harbor,
crowded
with
ships
from
the
other
Free
Cities,
from
Westeros
and
Ibben
and
the
fabled,
far-off
lands
of
the
east.
And
everywhere
else
were
little
piers
and
ferry
berths
and
old
grey
wharves
where
shrimpers
and
crabbers
and
fisherfolk
moored
after
working
the
mudflats
and
river
mouths.
“It
would
be
too
great
a
strain
on
you.”

“Then
go
in
my
stead,”
Aemon
urged,
“and
bring
me
someone
who
has
seen
these
dragons.”

“Me?”
Sam
was
dismayed
by
the
suggestion.
“Maester,
it
was
only
a
story.
A
sailor’s
story.”
Dareon
was
to
blame
for
this
as
well.
The
singer
had
been
bringing
back
all
manner
of
queer
tales
from
the
alehouses
and
brothels.
Unfortunately,
he
had
been
in
his
cups
when
he
heard
the
one
about
the
dragons
and
could
not
recall
the
details.
“Dareon
may
have
made
up
the
whole
story.
Singers
do
that.
They
make
things
up.”

“They
do,”
said
Maester
Aemon,
“but
even
the
most
fanciful
song
may
hold
a
kernel
of
truth.
Find
that
truth
for
me,
Sam.”

“I
wouldn’t
know
who
to
ask,
or
how
to
ask
him.
I
only
have
a
little
High
Valyrian,
and
when
they
speak
to
me
in
Braavosi
I
cannot
understand
half
of
what
they’re
saying.
You
speak
more
tongues
than
I
do,
once
you
are
stronger
you
can...”

“When
will
I
be
stronger,
Sam?
Tell
me
that.”

“Soon.
If
you
rest
and
eat.
When
we
reach
Oldtown...”

“I
shall
not
see
Oldtown
again.
I
know
that
now.”
The
old
man
tightened
his
grip
on
Sam’s
arm.
“I
will
be
with
my
brothers
soon.
Some
were
bound
to
me
by
vows
and
some
by
blood,
but
they
were
all
my
brothers.
And
my
father...
he
never
thought
the
throne
would
pass
to
him,
and
yet
it
did.
He
used
to
say
that
was
his
punishment
for
the
blow
that
slew
his
brother.
I
pray
he
found
the
peace
in
death
that
he
never
knew
in
life.
The
septons
sing
of
sweet
surcease,
of
laying
down
our
burdens
and
voyaging
to
a
far
sweet
land
where
we
may
laugh
and
love
and
feast
until
the
end
of
days...
but
what
if
there
is
no
land
of
light
and
honey,
only
cold
and
dark
and
pain
beyond
the
wall
called
death?”

He
is
afraid,
Sam
realized.
“You
are
not
dying.
You’re
ill,
that’s
all.
It
will
pass.”

“Not
this
time,
Sam.
I
dreamed...
in
the
black
of
night
a
man
asks
all
the
questions
he
dare
not
ask
by
daylight.
For
me,
these
past
years,
only
one
question
has
remained.
Why
would
the
gods
take
my
eyes
and
my
strength,
yet
condemn
me
to
linger
on
so
long,
frozen
and
forgotten?
What
use
could
they
have
for
an
old
done
man
like
me?”
Aemon’s
fingers
trembled,
twigs
sheathed
in
spotted
skin.
“I
remember,
Sam.
I
still
remember.”

He
was
not
making
sense.
“Remember
what?”

“Dragons,”
Aemon
whispered.
“The
grief
and
glory
of
my
House,
they
were.”

“The
last
dragon
died
before
you
were
born,”
said
Sam.
“How
could
you
remember
them?”

“I
see
them
in
my
dreams,
Sam.
I
see
a
red
star
bleeding
in
the
sky.
I
still
remember
red.
I
see
their
shadows
on
the
snow,
hear
the
crack
of
leathern
wings,
feel
their
hot
breath.
My
brothers
dreamed
of
dragons
too,
and
the
dreams
killed
them,
every
one.
Sam,
we
tremble
on
the
cusp
of
half-remembered
prophecies,
of
wonders
and
terrors
that
no
man
now
living
could
hope
to
comprehend...
or...”

“Or?”
said
Sam.

“...or
not.”
Aemon
chuckled
softly.
“Or
I
am
an
old
man,
feverish
and
dying.”
He
closed
his
white
eyes
wearily,
then
forced
them
open
once
again.
“I
should
not
have
left
the
Wall.
Lord
Snow
could
not
have
known,
but
I
should
have
seen
it.
Fire
consumes,
but
cold
preserves.
The
Wall...
but
it
is
too
late
to
go
running
back.
The
Stranger
waits
outside
my
door
and
will
not
be
denied.
Steward,
you
have
served
me
faithfully.
Do
this
one
last
brave
thing
for
me.
Go
down
to
the
ships,
Sam.
Learn
all
you
can
about
these
dragons.”

Sam
eased
his
arm
out
of
the
old
man’s
grasp.
“I
will.
If
you
want.
I
only...”
He
did
not
know
what
else
to
say.
I
cannot
refuse
him.
He
could
look
for
Dareon
as
well,
along
the
docks
and
wharves
of
the
Ragman’s
Harbor.
I
will
find
Dareon
first,
and
we’ll
go
to
the
ships
together.
And
when
we
come
back,
we’ll
bring
food
and
wine
and
wood.
We’ll
have
a
fire
and
a
good
hot
meal.
He
rose.
“Well.
I
should
go,
then.
If
I
am
going.
Gilly
will
be
here.
Gilly,
bar
the
door
when
I
am
gone.”
The
Stranger
waits
outside
the
door.

Gilly
nodded,
cradling
the
babe
against
her
breast,
her
eyes
welling
full
of
tears.
She
is
going
to
weep
again,
Sam
realized.
It
was
more
than
he
could
take.
His
swordbelt
hung
from
a
peg
on
the
wall,
beside
the
old
cracked
horn
that
Jon
had
given
him.
He
ripped
it
down
and
buckled
it
about
him,
then
swept
his
black
wool
cloak
about
his
rounded
shoulders,
slumped
through
the
door,
and
clattered
down
a
wooden
stair
whose
steps
creaked
beneath
his
weight.
The
inn
had
two
front
doors,
one
opening
on
a
street
and
one
on
a
canal.
Sam
went
out
through
the
former,
to
avoid
the
common
room
where
the
innkeep
was
sure
to
give
him
the
sour
eye
that
he
reserved
for
guests
who
had
overstayed
their
welcome.

There
was
a
chill
in
the
air,
but
the
night
was
not
half
so
foggy
as
some.
Sam
was
grateful
for
that
much.
Sometimes
the
mists
covered
the
ground
so
thick
that
a
man
could
not
see
his
own
feet.
Once
he
had
come
within
a
step
of
walking
into
a
canal.

As
a
boy
Sam
had
read
a
history
of
Braavos
and
dreamed
of
one
day
coming
here.
He
wanted
to
behold
the
Titan
rising
stern
and
fearsome
from
the
sea,
glide
down
the
canals
in
a
serpent
boat
past
all
the
palaces
and
temples,
and
watch
the
bravos
do
their
water
dance,
blades
flashing
in
the
starlight.
But
now
that
he
was
here,
all
he
wanted
was
to
leave
and
go
to
Oldtown.

With
his
hood
up
and
his
cloak
flapping,
he
made
his
way
along
the
cobblestones
toward
the
Ragman’s
Harbor.
His
swordbelt
kept
threatening
to
fall
down
about
his
ankles,
so
he
had
to
keep
tugging
it
back
up
as
he
went.
He
stayed
to
the
smaller,
darker
streets,
where
he
was
less
likely
to
encounter
anyone,
yet
every
passing
cat
still
made
his
heart
thump...
and
Braavos
crawled
with
cats.
I
need
to
find
Dareon,
he
thought.
He
is
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
my
Sworn
Brother;
he
and
I
will
puzzle
out
what
to
do.
Maester
Aemon’s
strength
was
gone,
and
Gilly
would
have
been
lost
here
even
if
she
had
not
been
grief-stricken,
but
Dareon...
I
should
not
think
ill
of
him.
He
could
be
hurt,
perhaps
that
is
why
he
did
not
come
back.
He
could
be
dead,
lying
in
some
alley
in
a
pool
of
blood,
or
floating
facedown
in
one
of
the
canals.
At
night
the
bravos
swaggered
through
the
city
in
their
parti-colored
finery,
spoiling
to
prove
their
skill
with
those
slender
swords
they
wore.
Some
would
fight
for
any
cause,
some
for
none
at
all,
and
Dareon
had
a
loose
tongue
and
quick
temper,
especially
when
he’d
been
drinking.
Just
because
a
man
can
sing
about
battles
doesn’t
mean
he’s
fit
to
fight
one.

The
best
alehouses,
inns,
and
brothels
were
near
the
Purple
Harbor
or
the
Moon
Pool,
but
Dareon
preferred
the
Ragman’s
Harbor,
where
the
patrons
were
more
apt
to
speak
the
Common
Tongue.
Sam
began
his
search
at
the
Inn
of
the
Green
Eel,
the
Black
Bargeman,
and
Moroggo’s,
places
where
Dareon
had
played
before.
He
was
not
to
be
found
at
any
of
them.
Outside
the
Foghouse
several
serpent
boats
were
tied
up
awaiting
patrons,
and
Sam
tried
to
ask
the
polemen
if
they
had
seen
a
singer
all
in
black,
but
none
of
the
polemen
understood
his
High
Valyrian.
That,
or
they
do
not
chose
to
understand.
Sam
peered
into
the
dingy
winesink
beneath
the
second
arch
of
Nabbo’s
Bridge,
barely
large
enough
to
accommodate
ten
people.
Dareon
was
not
one
of
them.
He
tried
the
Outcast
Inn,
the
House
of
Seven
Lamps,
and
the
brothel
called
the
Cattery,
where
he
got
strange
looks
but
no
help.

Leaving,
he
almost
bumped
into
two
young
men
beneath
the
Cattery’s
red
lantern.
One
was
dark
and
one
was
fair.
The
dark-haired
one
said
something
in
Braavosi.
“I
am
sorry,”
Sam
had
to
say.
“I
do
not
understand.”
He
edged
away
from
them,
afraid.
In
the
Seven
Kingdoms
nobles
draped
themselves
in
velvets,
silks,
and
samites
of
a
hundred
hues
whilst
peasants
and
smallfolk
wore
raw
wool
and
dull
brown
roughspun.
In
Braavos
it
was
otherwise.
The
bravos
swaggered
about
like
peacocks,
fingering
their
swords,
whilst
the
mighty
dressed
in
charcoal
grey
and
purple,
blues
that
were
almost
black
and
blacks
as
dark
as
a
moonless
night.

“My
friend
Terro
says
you
are
so
fat
you
make
him
sick,”
said
the
fair-haired
bravo,
whose
jacket
was
green
velvet
on
one
side
and
cloth-of-silver
on
the
other.
“My
friend
Terro
says
that
the
rattle
of
your
sword
makes
his
head
ache.”
He
was
speaking
in
the
Common
Tongue.
The
other
one,
the
dark-haired
bravo
in
the
burgundy
brocade
and
yellow
cloak
whose
name
would
appear
to
have
been
Terro,
made
some
comment
in
Braavosi,
and
his
fair-haired
friend
laughed,
and
said,
“My
friend
Terro
says
you
dress
above
your
station.
Are
you
some
great
lord,
to
wear
the
black?”

Sam
wanted
to
run,
but
if
he
did
was
like
to
trip
over
his
own
swordbelt.
Do
not
touch
your
sword,
he
told
himself.
Even
a
finger
on
the
hilt
might
be
enough
for
one
or
the
other
of
the
bravos
to
take
as
a
challenge.
He
tried
to
think
of
words
that
might
appease
them.
“I’m
not—”
was
all
he
managed.

“He
is
not
a
lord,”
a
child’s
voice
put
in.
“He’s
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
stupid.
From
Westeros.”
A
girl
edged
into
the
light,
pushing
a
barrow
full
of
seaweed;
a
scruffy,
skinny
creature
in
big
boots,
with
ragged
unwashed
hair.
“There’s
another
one
down
at
the
Happy
Port,
singing
songs
to
the
Sailor’s
Wife,”
she
informed
the
two
bravos.
To
Sam
she
said,
“If
they
ask
who
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world,
say
the
Nightingale
or
else
they’ll
challenge
you.
Do
you
want
to
buy
some
clams?
I
sold
all
my
oysters.”

“I
have
no
coin,”
Sam
said.

“He
has
no
coin,”
mocked
the
fair-haired
bravo.
His
dark-haired
friend
grinned
and
said
something
in
Braavosi.
“My
friend
Terro
is
chilly.
Be
our
good
fat
friend
and
give
him
your
cloak.”

“Don’t
do
that
either,”
said
the
barrow
girl,
“or
else
they’ll
ask
for
your
boots
next,
and
before
long
you’ll
be
naked.”

“Little
cats
who
howl
too
loud
get
drowned
in
the
canals,”
warned
the
fair-haired
bravo.

“Not
if
they
have
claws.”
And
suddenly
there
was
a
knife
in
the
girl’s
left
hand,
a
blade
as
skinny
as
she
was.
The
one
called
Terro
said
something
to
his
fair-haired
friend
and
the
two
of
them
moved
off,
chuckling
at
one
another.

“Thank
you,”
Sam
told
the
girl
when
they
were
gone.

Her
knife
vanished.
“If
you
wear
a
sword
at
night
it
means
you
can
be
challenged.
Did
you
want
to
fight
them?”

“No.”
It
came
out
in
a
squeak
that
made
Sam
wince.

“Are
you
truly
in
the
Night’s
Watch?
I
never
saw
a
black
brother
like
you
before.”
The
girl
gestured
at
the
barrow.
“You
can
have
the
last
clams
if
you
want.
It’s
dark,
no
one
will
buy
them
now.
Are
you
sailing
to
the
Wall?”

“To
Oldtown.”
Sam
took
one
of
the
baked
clams
and
wolfed
it
down.
“We’re
between
ships.”
The
clam
was
good.
He
ate
another.

“The
bravos
never
bother
anyone
without
a
sword.
Not
even
stupid
camel
cunts
like
Terro
and
Orbelo.”

“Who
are
you?”

“No
one.”
She
stank
of
fish.
“I
used
to
be
someone,
but
now
I’m
not.
You
can
call
me
Cat,
if
you
like.
Who
are
you?”

“Samwell,
of
House
Tarly.
You
speak
the
Common
Tongue.”

“My
father
was
the
oarmaster
on
Nymeria.
A
bravo
killed
him
for
saying
that
my
mother
was
more
beautiful
than
the
Nightingale.
Not
one
of
those
camel
cunts
you
met,
a
real
bravo.
Someday
I’ll
slit
his
throat.
The
captain
said
Nymeria
had
no
need
of
little
girls,
so
he
put
me
off.
Brusco
took
me
in
and
gave
me
a
barrow.”
She
looked
up
at
him.
“What
ship
will
you
be
sailing
on?”

“We
bought
passage
on
the
Lady
Ushanora.”

The
girl
squinted
at
him
suspiciously.
“She’s
gone.
Don’t
you
know?
She
left
days
and
days
ago.”

I
know,
Sam
might
have
said.
He
and
Dareon
had
stood
on
the
dock
watching
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
oars
as
she
beat
for
the
Titan
and
the
open
sea.
“Well,”
the
singer
said,
“that’s
done.”
If
Sam
had
been
a
braver
man,
he
would
have
shoved
him
into
the
water.
When
it
came
to
talking
girls
out
of
their
clothes
Dareon
had
a
honeyed
tongue,
yet
in
the
captain’s
cabin
somehow
Sam
had
done
all
the
talking,
trying
to
persuade
the
Braavosi
to
wait
for
them.
“Three
days
I
have
waited
for
this
old
man,”
the
captain
had
said.
“My
holds
are
full,
and
my
men
have
fucked
their
wives
farewell.
With
you
or
without,
my
Lady
leaves
on
the
tide.”

“Please,”
Sam
had
pleaded.
“Just
a
few
more
days,
that’s
all
I
ask.
So
Maester
Aemon
can
recover
his
strength.”

“He
has
no
strength.”
The
captain
had
visited
the
inn
the
night
before
to
see
Maester
Aemon
for
himself.
“He
is
old
and
ill
and
I
will
not
have
him
dying
on
my
Lady.
Stay
with
him
or
leave
him,
it
matters
not
to
me.
I
sail.”
Even
worse,
he
had
refused
to
return
the
passage
money
they
had
paid
him,
the
silver
that
was
meant
to
see
them
safe
to
Oldtown.
“You
bought
my
finest
cabin.
It
is
there,
awaiting
you.
If
you
do
not
choose
to
occupy
it,
that
is
no
fault
of
mine.
Why
should
I
bear
the
loss?”

By
now
we
might
be
at
Duskendale,
Sam
thought
mournfully.
We
might
even
have
reached
Pentos,
if
the
winds
were
kind.

But
none
of
that
would
matter
to
the
barrow
girl.
“You
said
you
saw
a
singer...”

“At
the
Happy
Port.
He’s
going
to
wed
the
Sailor’s
Wife.”

“Wed?”

“She
only
beds
the
ones
who
marry
her.”

“Where
is
this
Happy
Port?”

“Across
from
the
Mummer’s
Ship.
I
can
show
you
the
way.”

“I
know
the
way.”
Sam
had
seen
the
Mummer’s
Ship.
Dareon
cannot
wed!
He
said
the
words!
“I
have
to
go.”

He
ran.
It
was
a
long
way
over
slick
cobbles.
Before
long
he
was
puffing,
his
big
black
cloak
flapping
noisily
behind
him.
He
had
to
keep
one
hand
on
his
swordbelt
as
he
ran.
What
few
people
he
encountered
gave
him
curious
looks,
and
once
a
cat
reared
up
and
hissed
at
him.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
ship
he
was
staggering.
The
Happy
Port
was
just
across
the
alley.

No
sooner
had
he
entered,
flushed
and
out
of
breath,
than
a
one-eyed
woman
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck.
“Don’t,”
Sam
told
her,
“I’m
not
here
for
that.”
She
answered
in
Braavosi.
“I
do
not
speak
that
tongue,”
Sam
said
in
High
Valyrian.
There
were
candles
burning
and
a
fire
crackling
in
the
hearth.
Someone
was
sawing
on
a
fiddle,
and
he
saw
two
girls
dancing
around
a
red
priest,
holding
hands.
The
one-eyed
woman
pressed
her
breasts
against
his
chest.
“Don’t
do
that!
I’m
not
here
for
that!”

“Sam!”
Dareon’s
familiar
voice
rang
out.
“Yna,
let
him
go,
that’s
Sam
the
Slayer.
My
Sworn
Brother!”

The
one-eyed
woman
peeled
away,
though
she
kept
one
hand
on
his
arm.
One
of
the
dancers
called
out,
“He
can
slay
me
if
he
likes,”
and
the
other
said,
“Do
you
think
he’d
let
me
touch
his
sword?”
Behind
them
a
purple
galleas
had
been
painted
on
the
wall,
crewed
by
women
clad
in
thigh-high
boots
and
nothing
else.
A
Tyroshi
sailor
was
passed
out
in
a
corner,
snoring
into
his
huge
scarlet
beard.
Elsewhere
an
older
woman
with
huge
breasts
was
turning
tiles
with
a
massive
Summer
Islander
in
black-and-scarlet
feathers.
In
the
center
of
it
all
sat
Dareon,
nuzzling
at
the
neck
of
the
woman
in
his
lap.
She
was
wearing
his
black
cloak.

“Slayer,”
the
singer
called
out
drunkenly,
“come
meet
my
lady
wife.”
His
hair
was
sand
and
honey,
his
smile
warm.
“I
sang
her
love
songs.
Women
melt
like
butter
when
I
sing.
How
could
I
resist
this
face?”
He
kissed
her
nose.
“Wife,
give
Slayer
a
kiss,
he’s
my
brother.”
When
the
girl
got
to
her
feet,
Sam
saw
that
she
was
naked
underneath
the
cloak.
“Don’t
go
fondling
my
wife
now,
Slayer,”
said
Dareon,
laughing.
“But
if
you
want
one
of
her
sisters,
you
feel
free.
I
still
have
coin
enough,
I
think.”

Coin
that
might
have
bought
us
food,
Sam
thought,
coin
that
might
have
bought
wood,
so
Maester
Aemon
could
keep
warm.
“What
have
you
done?
You
can’t
marry.
You
said
the
words,
the
same
as
me.
They
could
have
your
head
for
this.”

“We’re
only
wed
for
this
one
night,
Slayer.
Even
in
Westeros
no
one
takes
your
head
for
that.
Haven’t
you
ever
gone
to
Mole’s
Town
to
dig
for
buried
treasure?”

“No.”
Sam
reddened.
“I
would
never...”

“What
about
your
wildling
wench?
You
must
have
fucked
her
a
time
or
three.
All
those
nights
in
the
woods,
huddled
together
under
your
cloak,
don’t
you
tell
me
that
you
never
stuck
it
in
her.”
He
waved
a
hand
toward
a
chair.
“Sit
down,
Slayer.
Have
a
cup
of
wine.
Have
a
whore.
Have
both.”

Sam
did
not
want
a
cup
of
wine.
“You
promised
to
come
back
before
the
gloaming.
To
bring
back
wine
and
food.”

“Is
this
how
you
killed
that
Other?
Scolding
him
to
death?”
Dareon
laughed.
“She’s
my
wife,
not
you.
If
you
will
not
drink
to
my
marriage,
go
away.”

“Come
with
me,”
said
Sam.
“Maester
Aemon’s
woken
up
and
wants
to
hear
about
these
dragons.
He’s
talking
about
bleeding
stars
and
white
shadows
and
dreams
and...
if
we
could
find
out
more
about
these
dragons,
it
might
help
give
him
ease.
Help
me.”

“On
the
morrow.
Not
on
my
wedding
night.”
Dareon
pushed
himself
to
his
feet,
took
his
bride
by
the
hand,
and
started
toward
the
stairs,
pulling
her
behind
him.

Sam
blocked
his
way.
“You
promised,
Dareon.
You
said
the
words.
You’re
supposed
to
be
my
brother.”

“In
Westeros.
Does
this
look
like
Westeros
to
you?”

“Maester
Aemon—”

“—is
dying.
That
stripey
healer
you
wasted
all
our
silver
on
said
as
much.”
Dareon’s
mouth
had
turned
hard.
“Have
a
girl
or
go
away,
Sam.
You’re
ruining
my
wedding.”

“I’ll
go,”
said
Sam,
“but
you’ll
come
with
me.”

“No.
I’m
done
with
you.
I’m
done
with
black.”
Dareon
tore
his
cloak
off
his
naked
bride
and
tossed
it
in
Sam’s
face.
“Here.
Throw
that
rag
on
the
old
man,
it
may
keep
him
a
little
warmer.
I
shan’t
be
needing
it.
I’ll
be
clad
in
velvet
soon.
Next
year
I’ll
be
wearing
furs
and
eating—”

Sam
hit
him.

He
did
not
think
about
it.
His
hand
came
up,
curled
into
a
fist,
and
crashed
into
the
singer’s
mouth.
Dareon
cursed
and
his
naked
wife
gave
a
shriek
and
Sam
threw
himself
onto
the
singer
and
knocked
him
backwards
over
a
low
table.
They
were
almost
of
a
height,
but
Sam
weighed
twice
as
much,
and
for
once
he
was
too
angry
to
be
afraid.
He
punched
the
singer
in
the
face
and
in
the
belly,
then
began
to
pummel
him
about
the
shoulders
with
both
hands.
When
Dareon
grabbed
his
wrists,
Sam
butted
him
with
his
head
and
broke
his
lip.
The
singer
let
go
and
he
smashed
him
in
the
nose.
Somewhere
a
man
was
laughing,
a
woman
cursing.
The
fight
seemed
to
slow,
as
if
they
were
two
black
flies
struggling
in
amber.
Then
someone
dragged
Sam
off
the
singer’s
chest.
He
hit
that
person
too,
and
something
hard
crashed
into
his
head.

The
next
he
knew
he
was
outside,
flying
headfirst
through
the
fog.
For
half
a
heartbeat
he
saw
black
water
underneath
him.
Then
the
canal
came
up
and
smashed
him
in
the
face.

Sam
sank
like
a
stone,
like
a
boulder,
like
a
mountain.
The
water
got
into
his
eyes
and
up
his
nose,
dark
and
cold
and
salty.
When
he
tried
to
shout
for
help
he
swallowed
more.
Kicking
and
gasping,
he
rolled
over,
bubbles
bursting
from
his
nose.
Swim,
he
told
himself,
swim.
The
brine
stung
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them,
blinding
him.
He
popped
to
the
surface
for
just
an
instant,
sucked
down
air,
and
slapped
desperately
with
one
hand
whilst
the
other
scrabbled
at
the
wall
of
the
canal.
But
the
stones
were
slick
and
slimy
and
he
=======
beside
the
road.
He
was
a
better
archer
than
swordsman.
And
Bronn
rode
up
to
offer
Tyrion
a
double-bladed
axe.

“I
have
never
fought
with
an
axe.”
The
weapon
felt
awkward
and
unfamiliar
in
his
hands.
It
had
a
short
haft,
a
heavy
head,
a
nasty
spike
on
top.

“Pretend
you’re
splitting
logs,”
Bronn
said,
drawing
his
longsword
from
the
scabbard
across
his
back.
He
spat,
and
trotted
off
to
form
up
beside
Chiggen
and
Ser
Rodrik.
Ser
Willis
mounted
up
to
join
them,
fumbling
with
his
helmet,
a
metal
pot
with
a
thin
slit
for
his
eyes
and
a
long
black
silk
plume.

“Logs
don’t
bleed,”
Tyrion
said
to
no
one
in
particular.
He
felt
naked
without
armor.
He
looked
around
for
a
rock
and
ran
over
to
where
Marillion
was
hiding.
“Move
over.”

“Go
away!”
the
boy
screamed
back
at
him.
“I’m
a
singer,
I
want
no
part
of
this
fight!”

“What,
lost
your
taste
for
adventure?”
Tyrion
kicked
at
the
youth
until
he
slid
over,
and
not
a
moment
too
soon.
A
heartbeat
later,
the
riders
were
on
them.

There
were
no
heralds,
no
banners,
no
horns
nor
drums,
only
the
twang
of
bowstrings
as
Morrec
and
Lharys
let
fly,
and
suddenly
the
clansmen
came
thundering
out
of
the
dawn,
lean
dark
men
in
boiled
leather
and
mismatched
armor,
faces
hidden
behind
barred
halfhelms.
In
gloved
hands
were
clutched
all
manner
of
weapons:
longswords
and
lances
and
sharpened
scythes,
spiked
clubs
and
daggers
and
heavy
iron
mauls.
At
their
head
rode
a
big
man
in
a
striped
shadowskin
cloak,
armed
with
a
two-handed
greatsword.

Ser
Rodrik
shouted
“Winterfell!”
and
rode
to
meet
him,
with
Bronn
and
Chiggen
beside
him,
screaming
some
wordless
battle
cry.
Ser
Willis
Wode
followed,
swinging
a
spiked
morningstar
around
his
head.
“Harrenhal!
Harrenhal!”
he
sang.
Tyrion
felt
a
sudden
urge
to
leap
up,
brandish
his
axe,
and
boom
out,
“Casterly
Rock!”
but
the
insanity
passed
quickly
and
he
crouched
down
lower.

He
heard
the
screams
of
frightened
horses
and
the
crash
of
metal
on
metal.
Chiggen’s
sword
raked
across
the
naked
face
of
a
mailed
rider,
and
Bronn
plunged
through
the
clansmen
like
a
whirlwind,
cutting
down
foes
right
and
left.
Ser
Rodrik
hammered
at
the
big
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak,
their
horses
dancing
round
each
other
as
they
traded
blow
for
blow.
Jyck
vaulted
onto
a
horse
and
galloped
bareback
into
the
fray.
Tyrion
saw
an
arrow
sprout
from
the
throat
of
the
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak.
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
only
blood
came
out.
By
the
time
he
fell,
Ser
Rodrik
was
fighting
someone
else.

Suddenly
Marillion
shrieked,
covering
his
head
with
his
woodharp
as
a
horse
leapt
over
their
rock.
Tyrion
scrambled
to
his
feet
as
the
rider
turned
to
come
back
at
them,
hefting
a
spiked
maul.
Tyrion
swung
his
axe
with
both
hands.
The
blade
caught
the
charging
horse
in
the
throat
with
a
meaty
thunk,
angling
upward,
and
Tyrion
almost
lost
his
grip
as
the
animal
screamed
and
collapsed.
He
managed
to
wrench
the
axe
free
and
lurch
clumsily
out
of
the
way.
Marillion
was
less
fortunate.
Horse
and
rider
crashed
to
the
ground
in
a
tangle
on
top
of
the
singer.
Tyrion
danced
back
in
while
the
brigand’s
leg
was
still
pinned
beneath
his
fallen
mount,
and
buried
the
axe
in
the
man’s
neck,
just
above
the
shoulder
blades.

As
he
struggled
to
yank
the
blade
loose,
he
heard
Marillion
moaning
under
the
bodies.
“Someone
help
me,”
the
singer
gasped.
“Gods
have
mercy,
I’m
bleeding.”

“I
believe
that’s
horse
blood,”
Tyrion
said.
The
singer’s
hand
came
crawling
out
from
beneath
the
dead
animal,
scrabbling
in
the
dirt
like
a
spider
with
five
legs.
Tyrion
put
his
heel
on
the
grasping
fingers
and
felt
a
satisfying
crunch.
“Close
your
eyes
and
pretend
you’re
dead,”
he
advised
the
singer
before
he
hefted
the
axe
and
turned
away.

After
that,
things
ran
together.
The
dawn
was
full
of
shouts
and
screams
and
heavy
with
the
scent
of
blood,
and
the
world
had
turned
to
chaos.
Arrows
hissed
past
his
ear
and
clattered
off
the
rocks.
He
saw
Bronn
unhorsed,
fighting
with
a
sword
in
each
hand.
Tyrion
kept
on
the
fringes
of
the
fight,
sliding
from
rock
to
rock
and
darting
out
of
the
shadows
to
hew
at
the
legs
of
passing
horses.
He
found
a
wounded
clansman
and
left
him
dead,
helping
himself
to
the
man’s
halfhelm.
It
fit
too
snugly,
but
Tyrion
was
glad
of
any
protection
at
all.
Jyck
was
cut
down
from
behind
while
he
sliced
at
a
man
in
front
of
him,
and
later
Tyrion
stumbled
over
Kurleket’s
body.
The
pig
face
had
been
smashed
in
with
a
mace,
but
Tyrion
recognized
the
dirk
as
he
plucked
it
from
the
man’s
dead
fingers.
He
was
sliding
it
through
his
belt
when
he
heard
a
woman’s
scream.

Catelyn
Stark
was
trapped
against
the
stone
face
of
the
mountain
with
three
men
around
her,
one
still
mounted
and
the
other
two
on
foot.
She
had
a
dagger
clutched
awkwardly
in
her
maimed
hands,
but
her
back
was
to
the
rock
now
and
they
had
penned
her
on
three
sides.
Let
them
have
the
bitch,
Tyrion
thought,
and
welcome
to
her,
yet
somehow
he
was
moving.
He
caught
the
first
man
in
the
back
of
the
knee
before
they
even
knew
he
was
there,
and
the
heavy
axehead
split
flesh
and
bone
like
rotten
wood.
Logs
that
bleed,
Tyrion
thought
inanely
as
the
second
man
came
for
him.
Tyrion
ducked
under
his
sword,
lashed
out
with
the
axe,
the
man
reeled
backward…
and
Catelyn
Stark
stepped
up
behind
him
and
opened
his
throat.
The
horseman
remembered
an
urgent
engagement
elsewhere
and
galloped
off
suddenly.

Tyrion
looked
around.
The
enemy
were
all
vanquished
or
vanished.
Somehow
the
fighting
had
ended
when
he
wasn’t
looking.
Dying
horses
and
wounded
men
lay
all
around,
screaming
or
moaning.
To
his
vast
astonishment,
he
was
not
one
of
them.
He
opened
his
fingers
and
let
the
axe
thunk
to
the
ground.
His
hands
were
sticky
with
blood.
He
could
have
sworn
they
had
been
fighting
for
half
a
day,
but
the
sun
seemed
scarcely
to
have
moved
at
all.

“Your
first
battle?”
Bronn
asked
later
as
he
bent
over
Jyck’s
body,
pulling
off
his
boots.
They
were
good
boots,
as
befit
one
of
Lord
Tywin’s
men;
heavy
leather,
oiled
and
supple,
much
finer
than
what
Bronn
was
wearing.

Tyrion
nodded.
“My
father
will
be
so
proud,”
he
said.
His
legs
were
cramping
so
badly
he
could
scarcely
stand.
Odd,
he
had
never
once
noticed
the
pain
during
the
battle.

“You
need
a
woman
now,”
Bronn
said
with
a
glint
in
his
black
eyes.
He
shoved
the
boots
into
his
saddlebag.
“Nothing
like
a
woman
after
a
man’s
been
blooded,
take
my
word.”

Chiggen
stopped
looting
the
corpses
of
the
brigands
long
enough
to
snort
and
lick
his
lips.

Tyrion
glanced
over
to
where
Lady
Stark
was
dressing
Ser
Rodrik’s
wounds.
“I’m
willing
if
she
is,”
he
said.
The
freeriders
broke
into
laughter,
and
Tyrion
grinned
and
thought,
There’s
a
start.

Afterward
he
knelt
by
the
stream
and
washed
the
blood
off
his
face
in
water
cold
as
ice.
As
he
limped
back
to
the
others,
he
glanced
again
at
the
slain.
The
dead
clansmen
were
thin,
ragged
men,
their
horses
scrawny
and
undersized,
with
every
rib
showing.
What
weapons
Bronn
and
Chiggen
had
left
them
were
none
too
impressive.
Mauls,
clubs,
a
scythe…
He
remembered
the
big
man
in
the
shadowskin
cloak
who
had
dueled
Ser
Rodrik
with
a
two-handed
greatsword,
but
when
he
found
his
corpse
sprawled
on
the
stony
ground,
the
man
was
not
so
big
after
all,
the
cloak
was
gone,
and
Tyrion
saw
that
the
blade
was
badly
notched,
its
cheap
steel
spotted
with
rust.
Small
wonder
the
clansmen
had
left
nine
bodies
on
the
ground.

They
had
only
three
dead;
two
of
Lord
Bracken’s
men-at-arms,
Kurleket
and
Mohor,
and
his
own
man
Jyck,
who
had
made
such
a
bold
show
with
his
bareback
charge.
A
fool
to
the
end,
Tyrion
thought.

“Lady
Stark,
I
urge
you
to
press
on,
with
all
haste,”
Ser
Willis
Wode
said,
his
eyes
scanning
the
ridgetops
warily
through
the
slit
in
his
helm.
“We
drove
them
off
for
the
moment,
but
they
will
not
have
gone
far.”

“We
must
bury
our
dead,
Ser
Willis,”
she
said.
“These
were
brave
men.
I
will
not
leave
them
to
the
crows
and
shadowcats.”

“This
soil
is
too
stony
for
digging,”
Ser
Willis
said.

“Then
we
shall
gather
stones
for
cairns.”

“Gather
all
the
stones
you
want,”
Bronn
told
her,
“but
do
it
without
me
or
Chiggen.
I’ve
better
things
to
do
than
pile
rocks
on
dead
men…
breathing,
for
one.”
He
looked
over
the
rest
of
the
survivors.
“Any
of
you
who
hope
to
be
alive
come
nightfall,
ride
with
us.”

“My
lady,
I
fear
he
speaks
the
truth,”
Ser
Rodrik
said
wearily.
The
old
knight
had
been
wounded
in
the
fight,
a
deep
gash
in
his
left
arm
and
a
spear
thrust
that
grazed
his
neck,
and
he
sounded
his
age.
“If
we
linger
here,
they
will
be
on
us
again
for
a
certainty,
and
we
may
not
live
through
a
second
attack.”

Tyrion
could
see
the
anger
in
Catelyn’s
face,
but
she
had
no
choice.
“May
the
gods
forgive
us,
then.
We
will
ride
at
once.”

There
was
no
shortage
of
horses
now.
Tyrion
moved
his
saddle
to
Jyck’s
spotted
gelding,
who
looked
strong
enough
to
last
another
three
or
four
days
at
least.
He
was
about
to
mount
when
Lharys
stepped
up
and
said,
“I’ll
take
that
dirk
now,
dwarf.”

“Let
him
keep
it.”
Catelyn
Stark
looked
down
from
her
horse.
“And
see
that
he
has
his
axe
back
as
well.
We
may
have
need
of
it
if
we
are
attacked
again.”

“You
have
my
thanks,
lady,”
Tyrion
said,
mounting
up.

“Save
them,”
she
said
curtly.
“I
trust
you
no
more
than
I
did
before.”
She
was
gone
before
he
could
frame
a
reply.

Tyrion
adjusted
his
stolen
helm
and
took
the
axe
from
Bronn.
He
remembered
how
he
had
begun
the
journey,
with
his
wrists
bound
and
a
hood
pulled
down
over
his
head,
and
decided
that
this
was
a
definite
improvement.
Lady
Stark
could
keep
her
trust;
so
long
as
he
could
keep
the
axe,
he
would
count
himself
ahead
in
the
game.

Ser
Willis
Wode
led
them
out.
Bronn
took
the
rear,
with
Lady
Stark
safely
in
the
middle,
Ser
Rodrik
a
shadow
beside
her.
Marillion
kept
throwing
sullen
looks
back
at
Tyrion
as
they
rode.
The
singer
had
broken
several
ribs,
his
woodharp,
and
all
four
fingers
on
his
playing
hand,
yet
the
day
had
not
been
an
utter
loss
to
him;
somewhere
he
had
acquired
a
magnificent
shadowskin
cloak,
thick
black
fur
slashed
by
stripes
of
white.
He
huddled
beneath
its
folds
silently,
and
for
once
had
nothing
to
say.

They
heard
the
deep
growls
of
shadowcats
behind
them
before
they
had
gone
half
a
mile,
and
later
the
wild
snarling
of
the
beasts
fighting
over
the
corpses
they
had
left
behind.
Marillion
grew
visibly
pale.
Tyrion
trotted
up
beside
him.
“Craven,”
he
said,
“rhymes
nicely
with
raven.”
He
kicked
his
horse
and
moved
past
the
singer,
up
to
Ser
Rodrik
and
Catelyn
Stark.

She
looked
at
him,
lips
pressed
tightly
together.

“As
I
was
saying
before
we
were
so
rudely
interrupted,”
Tyrion
began,
“there
is
a
serious
flaw
in
Littlefinger’s
fable.
Whatever
you
may
believe
of
me,
Lady
Stark,
I
promise
you
this—I
never
bet
against
my
family.”





ARYA

The
one-eared
black
tom
arched
his
back
and
hissed
at
her.

Arya
padded
down
the
alley,
balanced
lightly
on
the
balls
of
her
bare
feet,
listening
to
the
flutter
of
her
heart,
breathing
slow
deep
breaths.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself,
light
as
a
feather.
The
tomcat
watched
her
come,
his
eyes
wary.

Catching
cats
was
hard.
Her
hands
were
covered
with
half-healed
scratches,
and
both
knees
were
scabbed
over
where
she
had
scraped
them
raw
in
tumbles.
At
first
even
the
cook’s
huge
fat
kitchen
cat
had
been
able
to
elude
her,
but
Syrio
had
kept
her
at
it
day
and
night.
When
she’d
run
to
him
with
her
hands
bleeding,
he
had
said,
“So
slow?
Be
quicker,
girl.
Your
enemies
will
give
you
more
than
scratches.”
He
had
dabbed
her
wounds
with
Myrish
fire,
which
burned
so
bad
she
had
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
keep
from
screaming.
Then
he
sent
her
out
after
more
cats.

The
Red
Keep
was
full
of
cats:
lazy
old
cats
dozing
in
the
sun,
cold-eyed
mousers
twitching
their
tails,
quick
little
kittens
with
claws
like
needles,
ladies’
cats
all
combed
and
trusting,
ragged
shadows
prowling
the
midden
heaps.
One
by
one
Arya
had
chased
them
down
and
snatched
them
up
and
brought
them
proudly
to
Syrio
Forel…
all
but
this
one,
this
one-eared
black
devil
of
a
tomcat.
“That’s
the
real
king
of
this
castle
right
there,”
one
of
the
gold
cloaks
had
told
her.
“Older
than
sin
and
twice
as
mean.
One
time,
the
king
was
feasting
the
queen’s
father,
and
that
black
bastard
hopped
up
on
the
table
and
snatched
a
roast
quail
right
out
of
Lord
Tywin’s
fingers.
Robert
laughed
so
hard
he
like
to
burst.
You
stay
away
from
that
one,
child.”

He
had
run
her
halfway
across
the
castle;
twice
around
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
across
the
inner
bailey,
through
the
stables,
down
the
serpentine
steps,
past
the
small
kitchen
and
the
pig
yard
and
the
barracks
of
the
gold
cloaks,
along
the
base
of
the
river
wall
and
up
more
steps
and
back
and
forth
over
Traitor’s
Walk,
and
then
down
again
and
through
a
gate
and
around
a
well
and
in
and
out
of
strange
buildings
until
Arya
didn’t
know
where
she
was.

Now
at
last
she
had
him.
High
walls
pressed
close
on
either
side,
and
ahead
was
a
blank
windowless
mass
of
stone.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
repeated,
sliding
forward,
light
as
a
feather.

When
she
was
three
steps
away
from
him,
the
tomcat
bolted.
Left,
then
right,
he
went;
and
right,
then
left,
went
Arya,
cutting
off
his
escape.
He
hissed
again
and
tried
to
dart
between
her
legs.
Quick
as
a
snake,
she
thought.
Her
hands
closed
around
him.
She
hugged
him
to
her
chest,
whirling
and
laughing
aloud
as
his
claws
raked
at
the
front
of
her
leather
jerkin.
Ever
so
fast,
she
kissed
him
right
between
the
eyes,
and
jerked
her
head
back
an
instant
before
his
claws
would
have
found
her
face.
The
tomcat
yowled
and
spit.

“What’s
he
doing
to
that
cat?”

Startled,
Arya
dropped
the
cat
and
whirled
toward
the
voice.
The
tom
bounded
off
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
At
the
end
of
the
alley
stood
a
girl
with
a
mass
of
golden
curls,
dressed
as
pretty
as
a
doll
in
blue
satin.
Beside
her
was
a
plump
little
blond
boy
with
a
prancing
stag
sewn
in
pearls
across
the
front
of
his
doublet
and
a
miniature
sword
at
his
belt.
Princess
Myrcella
and
Prince
Tommen,
Arya
thought.
A
septa
as
large
as
a
draft
horse
hovered
over
them,
and
behind
her
two
big
men
in
crimson
cloaks,
Lannister
house
guards.

“What
were
you
doing
to
that
cat,
boy?”
Myrcella
asked
again,
sternly.
To
her
brother
she
said,
“He’s
a
ragged
boy,
isn’t
he?
Look
at
him.”
She
giggled.

“A
ragged
dirty
smelly
boy,”
Tommen
agreed.

They
don’t
know
me,
Arya
realized.
They
don’t
even
know
I’m
a
girl.
Small
wonder;
she
was
barefoot
and
dirty,
her
hair
tangled
from
the
long
run
through
the
castle,
clad
in
a
jerkin
ripped
by
cat
claws
and
brown
roughspun
pants
hacked
off
above
her
scabby
knees.
You
don’t
wear
skirts
and
silks
when
you’re
catching
cats.
Quickly
she
lowered
her
head
and
dropped
to
one
knee.
Maybe
they
wouldn’t
recognize
her.
If
they
did,
she
would
never
hear
the
end
of
it.
Septa
Mordane
would
be
mortified,
and
Sansa
would
never
speak
to
her
again
from
the
shame.

The
old
fat
septa
moved
forward.
“Boy,
how
did
you
come
here?
You
have
no
business
in
this
part
of
the
castle.”

“You
can’t
keep
this
sort
out,”
one
of
the
red
cloaks
said.
“Like
trying
to
keep
out
rats.”

“Who
do
you
belong
to,
boy?”
the
septa
demanded.
“Answer
me.
What’s
wrong
with
you,
are
you
mute?”

Arya’s
voice
caught
in
her
throat.
If
she
answered,
Tommen
and
Myrcella
would
know
her
for
certain.

“Godwyn,
bring
him
here,”
the
septa
said.
The
taller
of
the
guardsmen
started
down
the
alley.

Panic
gripped
her
throat
like
a
giant’s
hand.
Arya
could
not
have
spoken
if
her
life
had
hung
on
it.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
mouthed
silently.

As
Godwyn
reached
for
her,
Arya
moved.
Quick
as
a
snake.
She
leaned
to
her
left,
letting
his
fingers
brush
her
arm,
spinning
around
him.
Smooth
as
summer
silk.
By
the
time
he
got
himself
turned,
she
was
sprinting
down
the
alley.
Swift
as
a
deer.
The
septa
was
screeching
at
her.
Arya
slid
between
legs
as
thick
and
white
as
marble
columns,
bounded
to
her
feet,
bowled
into
Prince
Tommen
and
hopped
over
him
when
he
sat
down
hard
and
said
“Oof,”
spun
away
from
the
second
guard,
and
then
she
was
past
them
all,
running
full
out.

She
heard
shouts,
then
pounding
footsteps,
closing
behind
her.
She
dropped
and
rolled.
The
red
cloak
went
careening
past
her,
stumbling.
Arya
sprang
back
to
her
feet.
She
saw
a
window
above
her,
high
and
narrow,
scarcely
more
than
an
arrow
slit.
Arya
leapt,
caught
the
sill,
pulled
herself
up.
She
held
her
breath
as
she
wriggled
through.
Slippery
as
an
eel.
Dropping
to
the
floor
in
front
of
a
startled
scrubwoman,
she
hopped
up,
brushed
the
rushes
off
her
clothes,
and
was
off
again,
out
the
door
and
along
a
long
hall,
down
a
stair,
across
a
hidden
courtyard,
around
a
corner
and
over
a
wall
and
through
a
low
narrow
window
into
a
pitch-dark
cellar.
The
sounds
grew
more
and
more
distant
behind
her.

Arya
was
out
of
breath
and
quite
thoroughly
lost.
She
was
in
for
it
now
if
they
had
recognized
her,
but
she
didn’t
think
they
had.
She’d
moved
too
fast.
Swift
as
a
deer.

She
hunkered
down
in
the
dark
against
a
damp
stone
wall
and
listened
for
the
pursuit,
but
the
only
sound
was
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
and
a
distant
drip
of
water.
Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
told
herself.
She
wondered
where
she
was.
When
they
had
first
come
to
King’s
Landing,
she
used
to
have
bad
dreams
about
getting
lost
in
the
castle.
Father
said
the
Red
Keep
was
smaller
than
Winterfell,
but
in
her
dreams
it
had
been
immense,
an
endless
stone
maze
with
walls
that
seemed
to
shift
and
change
behind
her.
She
would
find
herself
wandering
down
gloomy
halls
past
faded
tapestries,
descending
endless
circular
stairs,
darting
through
courtyards
or
over
bridges,
her
shouts
echoing
unanswered.
In
some
of
the
rooms
the
red
stone
walls
would
seem
to
drip
blood,
and
nowhere
could
she
find
a
window.
Sometimes
she
would
hear
her
father’s
voice,
but
always
from
a
long
way
off,
and
no
matter
how
hard
she
ran
after
it,
it
would
grow
fainter
and
fainter,
until
it
faded
to
nothing
and
Arya
was
alone
in
the
dark.

It
was
very
dark
right
now,
she
realized.
She
hugged
her
bare
knees
tight
against
her
chest
and
shivered.
She
would
wait
quietly
and
count
to
ten
thousand.
By
then
it
would
be
safe
for
her
to
come
creeping
back
out
and
find
her
way
home.

By
the
time
she
had
reached
eighty-seven,
the
room
had
begun
to
lighten
as
her
eyes
adjusted
to
the
blackness.
Slowly
the
shapes
around
her
took
on
form.
Huge
empty
eyes
stared
at
her
hungrily
through
the
gloom,
and
dimly
she
saw
the
jagged
shadows
of
long
teeth.
She
had
lost
the
count.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
bit
her
lip
and
sent
the
fear
away.
When
she
looked
again,
the
monsters
would
be
gone.
Would
never
have
been.
She
pretended
that
Syrio
was
beside
her
in
the
dark,
whispering
in
her
ear.
Calm
as
still
water,
she
told
herself.
Strong
as
a
bear.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine.
She
opened
her
eyes
again.

The
monsters
were
still
there,
but
the
fear
was
gone.

Arya
got
to
her
feet,
moving
warily.
The
heads
were
all
around
her.
She
touched
one,
curious,
wondering
if
it
was
real.
Her
fingertips
brushed
a
massive
jaw.
It
felt
real
enough.
The
bone
was
smooth
beneath
her
hand,
cold
and
hard
to
the
touch.
She
ran
her
fingers
down
a
tooth,
black
and
sharp,
a
dagger
made
of
darkness.
It
made
her
shiver.

“It’s
dead,”
she
said
aloud.
“It’s
just
a
skull,
it
can’t
hurt
me.”
Yet
somehow
the
monster
seemed
to
know
she
was
there.
She
could
feel
its
empty
eyes
watching
her
through
the
gloom,
and
there
was
something
in
that
dim,
cavernous
room
that
did
not
love
her.
She
edged
away
from
the
skull
and
backed
into
a
second,
larger
than
the
first.
For
an
instant
she
could
feel
its
teeth
digging
into
her
shoulder,
as
if
it
wanted
a
bite
of
her
flesh.
Arya
whirled,
felt
leather
catch
and
tear
as
a
huge
fang
nipped
at
her
jerkin,
and
then
she
was
running.
Another
skull
loomed
ahead,
the
biggest
monster
of
all,
but
Arya
did
not
even
slow.
She
leapt
over
a
ridge
of
black
teeth
as
tall
as
swords,
dashed
through
hungry
jaws,
and
threw
herself
against
the
door.

Her
hands
found
a
heavy
iron
ring
set
in
the
wood,
and
she
yanked
at
it.
The
door
resisted
a
moment,
before
it
slowly
began
to
swing
inward,
with
a
creak
so
loud
Arya
was
certain
it
could
be
heard
all
through
the
city.
She
opened
the
door
just
far
enough
to
slip
through,
into
the
hallway
beyond.

If
the
room
with
the
monsters
had
been
dark,
the
hall
was
the
blackest
pit
in
the
seven
hells.
Calm
as
still
water,
Arya
told
herself,
but
even
when
she
gave
her
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust,
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
vague
grey
outline
of
the
door
she
had
come
through.
She
wiggled
her
fingers
in
front
of
her
face,
felt
the
air
move,
saw
nothing.
She
was
blind.
A
water
dancer
sees
with
all
her
senses,
she
reminded
herself.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
steadied
her
breathing
one
two
three,
drank
in
the
quiet,
reached
out
with
her
hands.

Her
fingers
brushed
against
rough
unfinished
stone
to
her
left.
She
followed
the
wall,
her
hand
skimming
along
the
surface,
taking
small
gliding
steps
through
the
darkness.
All
halls
lead
somewhere.
Where
there
is
a
way
in,
there
is
a
way
out.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Arya
would
not
be
afraid.
It
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
walking
a
long
ways
when
the
wall
ended
abruptly
and
a
draft
of
cold
air
blew
past
her
cheek.
Loose
hairs
stirred
faintly
against
her
skin.

From
somewhere
far
below
her,
she
heard
noises.
The
scrape
of
boots,
the
distant
sound
of
voices.
A
flickering
light
brushed
the
wall
ever
so
faintly,
and
she
saw
that
she
stood
at
the
top
of
a
great
black
well,
a
shaft
twenty
feet
across
plunging
deep
into
the
earth.
Huge
stones
had
been
set
into
the
curving
walls
as
steps,
circling
down
and
down,
dark
as
the
steps
to
hell
that
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
them
of.
And
something
was
coming
up
out
of
the
darkness,
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth…

Arya
peered
over
the
edge
and
felt
the
cold
black
breath
on
her
face.
Far
below,
she
saw
the
light
of
a
single
torch,
small
as
the
flame
of
a
candle.
Two
men,
she
made
out.
Their
shadows
writhed
against
the
sides
of
the
well,
tall
as
giants.
She
could
hear
their
voices,
echoing
up
the
shaft.

“…found
one
bastard,”
one
said.
“The
rest
will
come
soon.
A
day,
two
days,
a
fortnight…”

“And
when
he
learns
the
truth,
what
will
he
do?”
a
second
voice
asked
in
the
liquid
accents
of
the
Free
Cities.

“The
gods
alone
know,”
the
first
voice
said.
Arya
could
see
a
wisp
of
grey
smoke
drifting
up
off
the
torch,
writhing
like
a
snake
as
it
rose.
“The
fools
tried
to
kill
his
son,
and
what’s
worse,
they
made
a
mummer’s
farce
of
it.
He’s
not
a
man
to
put
that
aside.
I
warn
you,
the
wolf
and
lion
will
soon
be
at
each
other’s
throats,
whether
we
will
it
or
no.”

“Too
soon,
too
soon,”
the
voice
with
the
accent
complained.
“What
good
is
war
now?
We
are
not
ready.
Delay.”

“As
well
bid
me
stop
time.
Do
you
take
me
for
a
wizard?”

The
other
chuckled.
“No
less.”
Flames
licked
at
the
cold
air.
The
tall
shadows
were
almost
on
top
of
her.
An
instant
later
the
man
holding
the
torch
climbed
into
her
sight,
his
companion
beside
him.
Arya
crept
back
away
from
the
well,
dropped
to
her
stomach,
and
flattened
herself
against
the
wall.
She
held
her
breath
as
the
men
reached
the
top
of
the
steps.

“What
would
you
have
me
do?”
asked
the
torchbearer,
a
stout
man
in
a
leather
half
cape.
Even
in
heavy
boots,
his
feet
seemed
to
glide
soundlessly
over
the
ground.
A
round
scarred
face
and
a
stubble
of
dark
beard
showed
under
his
steel
cap,
and
he
wore
mail
over
boiled
leather,
and
a
dirk
and
shortsword
at
his
belt.
It
seemed
to
Arya
there
was
something
oddly
familiar
about
him.

“If
one
Hand
can
die,
why
not
a
second?”
replied
the
man
with
the
accent
and
the
forked
yellow
beard.
“You
have
danced
the
dance
before,
my
friend.”
He
was
no
one
Arya
had
ever
seen
before,
she
was
certain
of
it.
Grossly
fat,
yet
he
seemed
to
walk
lightly,
carrying
his
weight
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
as
a
water
dancer
might.
His
rings
glimmered
in
the
torchlight,
red-gold
and
pale
silver,
crusted
with
rubies,
sapphires,
slitted
yellow
tiger
eyes.
Every
finger
wore
a
ring;
some
had
two.

“Before
is
not
now,
and
this
Hand
is
not
the
other,”
the
scarred
man
said
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
hall.
Still
as
stone,
Arya
told
herself,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Blinded
by
the
blaze
of
their
own
torch,
they
did
not
see
her
pressed
flat
against
the
stone,
only
a
few
feet
away.

“Perhaps
so,”
the
forked
beard
replied,
pausing
to
catch
his
breath
after
the
long
climb.
“Nonetheless,
we
must
have
time.
The
princess
is
with
child.
The
khal
will
not
bestir
himself
until
his
son
is
born.
You
know
how
they
are,
these
savages.”

The
man
with
the
torch
pushed
at
something.
Arya
heard
a
deep
rumbling.
A
huge
slab
of
rock,
red
in
the
torchlight,
slid
down
out
of
the
ceiling
with
a
resounding
crash
that
almost
made
her
cry
out.
Where
the
entry
to
the
well
had
been
was
nothing
but
stone,
solid
and
unbroken.

“If
he
does
not
bestir
himself
soon,
it
may
be
too
late,”
the
stout
man
in
the
steel
cap
said.
“This
is
no
longer
a
game
for
two
players,
if
ever
it
was.
Stannis
Baratheon
and
Lysa
Arryn
have
fled
beyond
my
reach,
and
the
whispers
say
they
are
gathering
swords
around
them.
The
Knight
of
Flowers
writes
Highgarden,
urging
his
lord
father
to
send
his
sister
to
court.
The
girl
is
a
maid
of
fourteen,
sweet
and
beautiful
and
tractable,
and
Lord
Renly
and
Ser
Loras
intend
that
Robert
should
bed
her,
wed
her,
and
make
a
new
queen.
Littlefinger…
the
gods
only
know
what
game
Littlefinger
is
playing.
Yet
Lord
Stark’s
the
one
who
troubles
my
sleep.
He
has
the
bastard,
he
has
the
book,
and
soon
enough
he’ll
have
the
truth.
And
now
his
wife
has
abducted
Tyrion
Lannister,
thanks
to
Littlefinger’s
meddling.
Lord
Tywin
will
take
that
for
an
outrage,
and
Jaime
has
a
queer
affection
for
the
Imp.
If
the
Lannisters
move
north,
that
will
bring
the
Tullys
in
as
well.
Delay,
you
say.
Make
haste,
I
reply.
Even
the
finest
of
jugglers
cannot
keep
a
hundred
balls
in
the
air
forever.”

“You
are
more
than
a
juggler,
old
friend.
You
are
a
true
sorcerer.
All
I
ask
is
that
you
work
your
magic
awhile
longer.”
They
started
down
the
hall
in
the
direction
Arya
had
come,
past
the
room
with
the
monsters.

“What
I
can
do,
I
will,”
the
one
with
the
torch
said
softly.
“I
must
have
gold,
and
another
fifty
birds.”

She
let
them
get
a
long
way
ahead,
then
went
creeping
after
them.
Quiet
as
a
shadow.

“So
many?”
The
voices
were
fainter
as
the
light
dwindled
ahead
of
her.
“The
ones
you
need
are
hard
to
find…
so
young,
to
know
their
letters…
perhaps
older…
not
die
so
easy…”

“No.
The
younger
are
safer…
treat
them
gently…”

“…if
they
kept
their
tongues…”

“…the
risk…”

Long
after
their
voices
had
faded
away,
Arya
could
still
see
the
light
of
the
torch,
a
smoking
star
that
bid
her
follow.
Twice
it
seemed
to
disappear,
but
she
kept
on
straight,
and
both
times
she
found
herself
at
the
top
of
steep,
narrow
stairs,
the
torch
glimmering
far
below
her.
She
hurried
after
it,
down
and
down.
Once
she
stumbled
over
a
rock
and
fell
against
the
wall,
and
her
hand
found
raw
earth
supported
by
timbers,
whereas
before
the
tunnel
had
been
dressed
stone.

She
must
have
crept
after
them
for
miles.
Finally
they
were
gone,
but
there
was
no
place
to
go
but
forward.
She
found
the
wall
again
and
followed,
blind
and
lost,
pretending
that
Nymeria
was
padding
along
beside
her
in
the
darkness.
At
the
end
she
was
knee-deep
in
foul-smelling
water,
wishing
she
could
dance
upon
it
as
Syrio
might
have,
and
wondering
if
she’d
ever
see
light
again.
It
was
full
dark
when
finally
Arya
emerged
into
the
night
air.

She
found
herself
standing
at
the
mouth
of
a
sewer
where
it
emptied
into
the
river.
She
stank
so
badly
that
she
stripped
right
there,
dropping
her
soiled
clothing
on
the
riverbank
as
she
dove
into
the
deep
black
waters.
She
swam
until
she
felt
clean,
and
crawled
out
shivering.
Some
riders
went
past
along
the
river
road
as
Arya
was
washing
her
clothes,
but
if
they
saw
the
scrawny
naked
girl
scrubbing
her
rags
in
the
moonlight,
they
took
no
notice.

She
was
miles
from
the
castle,
but
from
anywhere
in
King’s
Landing
you
needed
only
to
look
up
to
see
the
Red
Keep
high
on
Aegon’s
Hill,
so
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
her
way.
Her
clothes
were
almost
dry
by
the
time
she
reached
the
gatehouse.
The
portcullis
was
down
and
the
gates
barred,
so
she
turned
aside
to
a
postern
door.
The
gold
cloaks
who
had
the
watch
sneered
when
she
told
them
to
let
her
in.
“Off
with
you,”
one
said.
“The
kitchen
scraps
are
gone,
and
we’ll
have
no
begging
after
dark.”

“I’m
not
a
beggar,”
she
said.
“I
live
here.”

“I
said,
off
with
you.
Do
you
need
a
clout
on
the
ear
to
help
your
hearing?”

“I
want
to
see
my
father.”

The
guards
exchanged
a
glance.
“I
want
to
fuck
the
queen
myself,
for
all
the
good
it
does
me,”
the
younger
one
said.

The
older
scowled.
“Who’s
this
father
of
yours,
boy,
the
city
ratcatcher?”

“The
Hand
of
the
King,”
Arya
told
him.

Both
men
laughed,
but
then
the
older
one
swung
his
fist
at
her,
casually,
as
a
man
would
swat
a
dog.
Arya
saw
the
blow
coming
even
before
it
began.
She
danced
back
out
of
the
way,
untouched.
“I’m
not
a
boy,”
she
spat
at
them.
“I’m
Arya
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
if
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
my
lord
father
will
have
both
your
heads
on
spikes.
If
you
don’t
believe
me,
fetch
Jory
Cassel
or
Vayon
Poole
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.”
She
put
her
hands
on
her
hips.
“Now
are
you
going
to
open
the
gate,
or
do
you
need
a
clout
on
the
ear
to
help
your
hearing?”

Her
father
was
alone
in
the
solar
when
Harwin
and
Fat
Tom
marched
her
in,
an
oil
lamp
glowing
softly
at
his
elbow.
He
was
bent
over
the
biggest
book
Arya
had
ever
seen,
a
great
thick
tome
with
cracked
yellow
pages
of
crabbed
script,
bound
between
faded
leather
covers,
but
he
closed
it
to
listen
to
Harwin’s
report.
His
face
was
stern
as
he
sent
the
men
away
with
thanks.

“You
realize
I
had
half
my
guard
out
searching
for
you?”
Eddard
Stark
said
when
they
were
alone.
“Septa
Mordane
is
beside
herself
with
fear.
She’s
in
the
sept
praying
for
your
safe
return.
Arya,
you
know
you
are
never
to
go
beyond
the
castle
gates
without
my
leave.”

“I
didn’t
go
out
the
gates,”
she
blurted.
“Well,
I
didn’t
mean
to.
I
was
down
in
the
dungeons,
only
they
turned
into
this
tunnel.
It
was
all
dark,
and
I
didn’t
have
a
torch
or
a
candle
to
see
by,
so
I
had
to
follow.
I
couldn’t
go
back
the
way
I
came
on
account
of
the
monsters.
Father,
they
were
talking
about
killing
you!
Not
the
monsters,
the
two
men.
They
didn’t
see
me,
I
was
being
still
as
stone
and
quiet
as
a
shadow,
but
I
heard
them.
They
said
you
had
a
book
and
a
bastard
and
if
one
Hand
could
die,
why
not
a
second?
Is
that
the
book?
Jon’s
the
bastard,
I
bet.”

“Jon?
Arya,
what
are
you
talking
about?
Who
said
this?”

“They
did,”
she
told
him.
“There
was
a
fat
one
with
rings
and
a
forked
yellow
beard,
and
another
in
mail
and
a
steel
cap,
and
the
fat
one
said
they
had
to
delay
but
the
other
one
told
him
he
couldn’t
keep
juggling
and
the
wolf
and
the
lion
were
going
to
eat
each
other
and
it
was
a
mummer’s
farce.”
She
tried
to
remember
the
rest.
She
hadn’t
quite
understood
everything
she’d
heard,
and
now
it
was
all
mixed
up
in
her
head.
“The
fat
one
said
the
princess
was
with
child.
The
one
in
the
steel
cap,
he
had
the
torch,
he
said
that
they
had
to
hurry.
I
think
he
was
a
wizard.”

“A
wizard,”
said
Ned,
unsmiling.
“Did
he
have
a
long
white
beard
and
tall
pointed
hat
speckled
with
stars?”

“No!
It
wasn’t
like
Old
Nan’s
stories.
He
didn’t
look
like
a
wizard,
but
the
fat
one
said
he
was.”

“I
warn
you,
Arya,
if
you’re
spinning
this
thread
of
air—”

“No,
I
told
you,
it
was
in
the
dungeons,
by
the
place
with
the
secret
wall.
I
was
chasing
cats,
and
well…”
She
screwed
up
her
face.
If
she
admitted
knocking
over
Prince
Tommen,
he
would
be
really
angry
with
her.
“…well,
I
went
in
this
window.
That’s
where
I
found
the
monsters.”

“Monsters
and
wizards,”
her
father
said.
“It
would
seem
you’ve
had
quite
an
adventure.
These
men
you
heard,
you
say
they
spoke
of
juggling
and
mummery?”

“Yes,”
Arya
admitted,
“only—”

“Arya,
they
were
mummers,”
her
father
told
her.
“There
must
be
a
dozen
troupes
in
King’s
Landing
right
now,
come
to
make
some
coin
off
the
tourney
crowds.
I’m
not
certain
what
these
two
were
doing
in
the
castle,
but
perhaps
the
king
has
asked
for
a
show.”

“No.”
She
shook
her
head
stubbornly.
“They
weren’t—”

“You
shouldn’t
be
following
people
about
and
spying
on
them
in
any
case.
Nor
do
I
cherish
the
notion
of
my
daughter
climbing
in
strange
windows
after
stray
cats.
Look
at
you,
sweetling.
Your
arms
are
covered
with
scratches.
This
has
gone
on
long
enough.
Tell
Syrio
Forel
that
I
want
a
word
with
hirn—”

He
was
interrupted
by
a
short,
sudden
knock.
“Lord
Eddard,
pardons,”
Desmond
called
out,
opening
the
door
a
crack,
“but
there’s
a
black
brother
here
begging
audience.
He
says
the
matter
is
urgent.
I
thought
you
would
want
to
know.”

“My
door
is
always
open
to
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Father
said.

Desmond
ushered
the
man
inside.
He
was
stooped
and
ugly,
with
an
unkempt
beard
and
unwashed
clothes,
yet
Father
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
asked
his
name.

“Yoren,
as
it
please
m’lord.
My
pardons
for
the
hour.”
He
bowed
to
Arya.
“And
this
must
be
your
son.
He
has
your
look.”

“I’m
a
girl,”
Arya
said,
exasperated.
If
the
old
man
was
down
from
the
Wall,
he
must
have
come
by
way
of
Winterfell.
“Do
you
know
my
brothers?”
she
asked
excitedly.
“Robb
and
Bran
are
at
Winterfell,
and
Jon’s
on
the
Wall.
Jon
Snow,
he’s
in
the
Night’s
Watch
too,
you
must
know
him,
he
has
a
direwolf,
a
white
one
with
red
eyes.
Is
Jon
a
ranger
yet?
I’m
Arya
Stark.”
The
old
man
in
his
smelly
black
clothes
was
looking
at
her
oddly,
but
Arya
could
not
seem
to
stop
talking.
“When
you
ride
back
to
the
Wall,
would
you
bring
Jon
a
letter
if
I
wrote
one?”
She
wished
Jon
were
here
right
now.
He’d
believe
her
about
the
dungeons
and
the
fat
man
with
the
forked
beard
and
the
wizard
in
the
steel
cap.

“My
daughter
often
forgets
her
courtesies,”
Eddard
Stark
said
with
a
faint
smile
that
softened
his
words.
“I
beg
your
forgiveness,
Yoren.
Did
my
brother
Benjen
send
you?”

“No
one
sent
me,
m’lord,
saving
old
Mormont.
I’m
here
to
find
men
for
the
Wall,
and
when
Robert
next
holds
court,
I’ll
bend
the
knee
and
cry
our
need,
see
if
the
king
and
his
Hand
have
some
scum
in
the
dungeons
they’d
be
well
rid
of.
You
might
say
as
Benjen
Stark
is
why
we’re
talking,
though.
His
blood
ran
black.
Made
him
my
brother
as
much
as
yours.
It’s
for
his
sake
I’m
come.
Rode
hard,
I
did,
near
killed
my
horse
the
way
I
drove
her,
but
I
left
the
others
well
behind.”

“The
others?”

Yoren
spat.
“Sellswords
and
freeriders
and
like
trash.
That
inn
was
full
o’
them,
and
I
saw
them
take
the
scent.
The
scent
of
blood
or
the
scent
of
gold,
they
smell
the
same
in
the
end.
Not
all
o’
them
made
for
King’s
Landing,
either.
Some
went
galloping
for
Casterly
Rock,
and
the
Rock
lies
closer.
Lord
Tywin
will
have
gotten
the
word
by
now,
you
can
count
on
it.”

Father
frowned.
“What
word
is
this?”

Yoren
eyed
Arya.
“One
best
spoken
in
private,
m’lord,
begging
your
pardons.”

“As
you
say.
Desmond,
see
my
daughter
to
her
chambers.”
He
kissed
her
on
the
brow.
“We’ll
finish
our
talk
on
the
morrow.”

Arya
stood
rooted
to
the
spot.
“Nothing
bad’s
happened
to
Jon,
has
it?”
she
asked
Yoren.
“Or
Uncle
Benjen?”

“Well,
as
to
Stark,
I
can’t
say.
The
Snow
boy
was
well
enough
when
I
left
the
Wall.
It’s
not
them
as
concerns
me.”

Desmond
took
her
hand.
“Come
along,
milady.
You
heard
your
lord
father.”

Arya
had
no
choice
but
to
go
with
him,
wishing
it
had
been
Fat
Tom.
With
Tom,
she
might
have
been
able
to
linger
at
the
door
on
some
excuse
and
hear
what
Yoren
was
saying,
but
Desmond
was
too
single-minded
to
trick.
“How
many
guards
does
my
father
have?”
she
asked
him
as
they
descended
to
her
bedchamber.

“Here
at
King’s
Landing?
Fifty.”

“You
wouldn’t
let
anyone
kill
him,
would
you?”
she
asked.

Desmond
laughed.
“No
fear
on
that
count,
little
lady.
Lord
Eddard’s
guarded
night
and
day.
He’ll
come
to
no
harm.”

“The
Lannisters
have
more
than
fifty
men,”
Arya
pointed
out.

“So
they
do,
but
every
northerner
is
worth
ten
of
these
southron
swords,
so
you
can
sleep
easy.”

“What
if
a
wizard
was
sent
to
kill
him?”

“Well,
as
to
that,”
Desmond
replied,
drawing
his
longsword,
“wizards
die
the
same
as
other
men,
once
you
cut
their
heads
off.”





EDDARD

“Robert,
I
beg
of
you,”
Ned
pleaded,
“hear
what
you
are
saying.
You
are
talking
of
murdering
a
child.”

“The
whore
is
pregnant!”
The
king’s
fist
slammed
down
on
the
council
table
loud
as
a
thunderclap.
“I
warned
you
this
would
happen,
Ned.
Back
in
the
barrowlands,
I
warned
you,
but
you
did
not
care
to
hear
it.
Well,
you’ll
hear
it
now.
I
want
them
dead,
mother
and
child
both,
and
that
fool
Viserys
as
well.
Is
that
plain
enough
for
you?
I
want
them
dead.”

The
other
councillors
were
all
doing
their
best
to
pretend
that
they
were
somewhere
else.
No
doubt
they
were
wiser
than
he
was.
Eddard
Stark
had
seldom
felt
quite
so
alone.
“You
will
dishonor
yourself
forever
if
you
do
this.”

“Then
let
it
be
on
my
head,
so
long
as
it
is
done.
I
am
not
so
blind
that
I
cannot
see
the
shadow
of
the
axe
when
it
is
hanging
over
my
own
neck.”

“There
is
no
axe,”
Ned
told
his
king.
“Only
the
shadow
of
a
shadow,
twenty
years
removed…
if
it
exists
at
all.”

“If?”
Varys
asked
softly,
wringing
powdered
hands
together.
“My
lord,
you
wrong
me.
Would
I
bring
ties
to
king
and
council?”

Ned
looked
at
the
eunuch
coldly.
“You
would
bring
us
the
whisperings
of
a
traitor
half
a
world
away,
my
lord.
Perhaps
Mormont
is
wrong.
Perhaps
he
is
lying.”

“Ser
Jorah
would
not
dare
deceive
me,”
Varys
said
with
a
sly
smile.
“Rely
on
it,
my
lord.
The
princess
is
with
child.”

“So
you
say.
If
you
are
wrong,
we
need
not
fear.
If
the
girl
miscarries,
we
need
not
fear.
If
she
births
a
daughter
in
place
of
a
son,
we
need
not
fear.
If
the
babe
dies
in
infancy,
we
need
not
fear.”

“But
if
it
is
a
boy?”
Robert
insisted.
“If
he
lives?”

“The
narrow
sea
would
still
lie
between
us.
I
shall
fear
the
Dothraki
the
day
they
teach
their
horses
to
run
on
water.”

The
king
took
a
swallow
of
wine
and
glowered
at
Ned
across
the
council
table.
“So
you
would
counsel
me
to
do
nothing
until
the
dragonspawn
has
landed
his
army
on
my
shores,
is
that
it?”

“This
‘dragonspawn’
is
in
his
mother’s
belly,”
Ned
said.
“Even
Aegon
did
no
conquering
until
after
he
was
weaned.”

“Gods!
You
are
stubborn
as
an
aurochs,
Stark.”
The
king
looked
around
the
council
table.
“Have
the
rest
of
you
mislaid
your
tongues?
Will
no
one
talk
sense
to
this
frozen-faced
fool?”

Varys
gave
the
king
an
unctuous
smile
and
laid
a
soft
hand
on
Ned’s
sleeve.
“I
understand
your
qualms,
Lord
Eddard,
truly
I
do.
It
gave
me
no
joy
to
bring
this
grievous
news
to
council.
It
is
a
terrible
thing
we
contemplate,
a
vile
thing.
Yet
we
who
presume
to
rule
must
do
vile
things
for
the
good
of
the
realm,
howevermuch
it
pains
us.”

Lord
Renly
shrugged.
“The
matter
seems
simple
enough
to
me.
We
ought
to
have
had
Viserys
and
his
sister
killed
years
ago,
but
His
Grace
my
brother
made
the
mistake
of
listening
to
Jon
Arryn.”

“Mercy
is
never
a
mistake,
Lord
Renly,”
Ned
replied.
“On
the
Trident,
Ser
Barristan
here
cut
down
a
dozen
good
men,
Robert’s
friends
and
mine.
When
they
brought
him
to
us,
grievously
wounded
and
near
death,
Roose
Bolton
urged
us
to
cut
his
throat,
but
your
brother
said,
‘I
will
not
kill
a
man
for
loyalty,
nor
for
fighting
well,’
and
sent
his
own
maester
to
tend
Ser
Barristan’s
wounds.”
He
gave
the
king
a
long
cool
look.
“Would
that
man
were
here
today.”

Robert
had
shame
enough
to
blush.
“It
was
not
the
same,”
he
complained.
“Ser
Barristan
was
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“Whereas
Daenerys
is
a
fourteen-year-old
girl.”
Ned
knew
he
was
pushing
this
well
past
the
point
of
wisdom,
yet
he
could
not
keep
silent.
“Robert,
I
ask
you,
what
did
we
rise
against
Aerys
Targaryen
for,
if
not
to
put
an
end
to
the
murder
of
children?”

“To
put
an
end
to
Targaryens!”
the
king
growled.

“Your
Grace,
I
never
knew
you
to
fear
Rhaegar.”
Ned
fought
to
keep
the
scorn
out
of
his
voice,
and
failed.
“Have
the
years
so
unmanned
you
that
you
tremble
at
the
shadow
of
an
unborn
child?”

Robert
purpled.
“No
more,
Ned,”
he
warned,
pointing.
“Not
another
word.
Have
you
forgotten
who
is
king
here?”

“No,
Your
Grace,”
Ned
replied.
“Have
you?”

“Enough!”
the
king
bellowed.
“I
am
sick
of
talk.
I’ll
be
done
with
this,
or
be
damned.
What
say
you
all?”

“She
must
be
killed,”
Lord
Renly
declared.

“We
have
no
choice,”
murmured
Varys.
“Sadly,
sadly…”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
raised
his
pale
blue
eyes
from
the
table
and
said,
“Your
Grace,
there
is
honor
in
facing
an
enemy
on
the
battlefield,
but
none
in
killing
him
in
his
mother’s
womb.
Forgive
me,
but
I
must
stand
with
Lord
Eddard.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
cleared
his
throat,
a
process
that
seemed
to
take
some
minutes.
“My
order
serves
the
realm,
not
the
ruler.
Once
I
counseled
King
Aerys
as
loyally
as
I
counsel
King
Robert
now,
so
I
bear
this
girl
child
of
his
no
ill
will.
Yet
I
ask
you
this—should
war
come
again,
how
many
soldiers
will
die?
How
many
towns
will
burn?
How
many
children
will
be
ripped
from
their
mothers
to
perish
on
the
end
of
a
spear?”
He
stroked
his
luxuriant
white
beard,
infinitely
sad,
infinitely
weary.
“Is
it
not
wiser,
even
kinder,
that
Daenerys
Targaryen
should
die
now
so
that
tens
of
thousands
might
live?”

“Kinder,”
Varys
said.
“Oh,
well
and
truly
spoken,
Grand
Maester.
It
is
so
true.
Should
the
gods
in
their
caprice
grant
Daenerys
Targaryen
a
son,
the
realm
must
bleed.”

Littlefinger
was
the
last.
As
Ned
looked
to
him,
Lord
Petyr
stifled
a
yawn.
“When
you
find
yourself
in
bed
with
an
ugly
woman,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
close
your
eyes
and
get
on
with
it,”
he
declared.
“Waiting
won’t
make
the
maid
any
prettier.
Kiss
her
and
be
done
with
it.”

“Kiss
her?”
Ser
Barristan
repeated,
aghast.

“A
steel
kiss,”
said
Littlefinger.

Robert
turned
to
face
his
Hand.
“Well,
there
it
is,
Ned.
You
and
Selmy
stand
alone
on
this
matter.
The
only
question
that
remains
is,
who
can
we
find
to
kill
her?”

“Mormont
craves
a
royal
pardon,”
Lord
Renly
reminded
them.

“Desperately,”
Varys
said,
“yet
he
craves
life
even
more.
By
now,
the
princess
nears
Vaes
Dothrak,
where
it
is
death
to
draw
a
blade.
If
I
told
you
what
the
Dothraki
would
do
to
the
poor
man
who
used
one
on
a
khaleesi,
none
of
you
would
sleep
tonight.”
He
stroked
a
powdered
cheek.
“Now,
poison…
the
tears
of
Lys,
let
us
say.
Khal
Drogo
need
never
know
it
was
not
a
natural
death.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle’s
sleepy
eyes
flicked
open.
He
squinted
suspiciously
at
the
eunuch.

“Poison
is
a
coward’s
weapon,”
the
king
complained.

Ned
had
heard
enough.
“You
send
hired
knives
to
kill
a
fourteen-year-old
girl
and
still
quibble
about
honor?”
He
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood.
“Do
it
yourself,
Robert.
The
man
who
passes
the
sentence
should
swing
the
sword.
Look
her
in
the
eyes
before
you
kill
her.
See
her
tears,
hear
her
last
words.
You
owe
her
that
much
at
least.”

“Gods,”
the
king
swore,
the
word
exploding
out
of
him
as
if
he
could
barely
contain
his
fury.
“You
mean
it,
damn
you.”
He
reached
for
the
flagon
of
wine
at
his
elbow,
found
it
empty,
and
flung
it
away
to
shatter
against
the
wall.
“I
am
out
of
wine
and
out
of
patience.
Enough
of
this.
Just
have
it
done.”

“I
will
not
be
part
of
murder,
Robert.
Do
as
you
will,
but
do
not
ask
me
to
fix
my
seal
to
it.”

For
a
moment
Robert
did
not
seem
to
understand
what
Ned
was
saying.
Defiance
was
not
a
dish
he
tasted
often.
Slowly
his
face
changed
as
comprehension
came.
His
eyes
narrowed
and
a
flush
crept
up
his
neck
past
the
velvet
collar.
He
pointed
an
angry
finger
at
Ned.
“You
are
the
King’s
Hand,
Lord
Stark.
You
will
do
as
I
command
you,
or
I’ll
find
me
a
Hand
who
will.”

“I
wish
him
every
success.”
Ned
unfastened
the
heavy
clasp
that
clutched
at
the
folds
of
his
cloak,
the
ornate
silver
hand
that
was
his
badge
of
office.
He
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
king,
saddened
by
the
memory
of
the
man
who
had
pinned
it
on
him,
the
friend
he
had
loved.
“I
thought
you
a
better
man
than
this,
Robert.
I
thought
we
had
made
a
nobler
king.”

Robert’s
face
was
purple.
“Out,”
he
croaked,
choking
on
his
rage.
“Out,
damn
you,
I’m
done
with
you.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Go,
run
back
to
Winterfell.
And
make
certain
I
never
look
on
your
face
again,
or
I
swear,
I’ll
have
your
head
on
a
spike!”

Ned
bowed,
and
turned
on
his
heel
without
another
word.
He
could
feel
Robert’s
eyes
on
his
back.
As
he
strode
from
the
council
chambers,
the
discussion
resumed
with
scarcely
a
pause.
“On
Braavos
there
is
a
society
called
the
Faceless
Men,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
offered.

“Do
you
have
any
idea
how
costly
they
are?”
Littlefinger
complained.
“You
could
hire
an
army
of
common
sellswords
for
half
the
price,
and
that’s
for
a
merchant.
I
don’t
dare
think
what
they
might
ask
for
a
princess.”

The
closing
of
the
door
behind
him
silenced
the
voices.
Ser
Boros
Blount
was
stationed
outside
the
chamber,
wearing
the
long
white
cloak
and
armor
of
the
Kingsguard.
He
gave
Ned
a
quick,
curious
glance
from
the
corner
of
his
eye,
but
asked
no
questions.

The
day
felt
heavy
and
oppressive
as
he
crossed
the
bailey
back
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
He
could
feel
the
threat
of
rain
in
the
air.
Ned
would
have
welcomed
it.
It
might
have
made
him
feel
a
trifle
less
unclean.
When
he
reached
his
solar,
he
summoned
Vayon
Poole.
The
steward
came
at
once.
“You
sent
for
me,
my
lord
Hand?”

“Hand
no
longer,”
Ned
told
him.
“The
king
and
I
have
quarreled.
We
shall
be
returning
to
Winterfell.”

“I
shall
begin
making
arrangements
at
once,
my
lord.
We
will
need
a
fortnight
to
ready
everything
for
the
journey.”

“We
may
not
have
a
fortnight.
We
may
not
have
a
day.
The
king
mentioned
something
about
seeing
my
head
on
a
spike.”
Ned
frowned.
He
did
not
truly
believe
the
king
would
harm
him,
not
Robert.
He
was
angry
now,
but
once
Ned
was
safely
out
of
sight,
his
rage
would
cool
as
it
always
did.

Always?
Suddenly,
uncomfortably,
he
found
himself
recalling
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
Fifteen
years
dead,
yet
Robert
hates
him
as
much
as
ever.
It
was
a
disturbing
notion…
and
there
was
the
other
matter,
the
business
with
Catelyn
and
the
dwarf
that
Yoren
had
warned
him
of
last
night.
That
would
come
to
light
soon,
as
sure
as
sunrise,
and
with
the
king
in
such
a
black
fury…
Robert
might
not
care
a
fig
for
Tyrion
Lannister,
but
it
would
touch
on
his
pride,
and
there
was
no
telling
what
the
queen
might
do.

“It
might
be
safest
if
I
went
on
ahead,”
he
told
Poole.
“I
will
take
my
daughters
and
a
few
guardsmen.
The
rest
of
you
can
follow
when
you
are
ready.
Inform
Jory,
but
tell
no
one
else,
and
do
nothing
until
the
girls
and
I
have
gone.
The
castle
is
full
of
eyes
and
ears,
and
I
would
rather
my
plans
were
not
known.”

“As
you
command,
my
lord.”

When
he
had
gone,
Eddard
Stark
went
to
the
window
and
sat
brooding.
Robert
had
left
him
no
choice
that
he
could
see.
He
ought
to
thank
him.
It
would
be
good
to
return
to
Winterfell.
He
ought
never
have
left.
His
sons
were
waiting
there.
Perhaps
he
and
Catelyn
would
make
a
new
son
together
when
he
returned,
they
were
not
so
old
yet.
And
of
late
he
had
often
found
himself
dreaming
of
snow,
of
the
deep
quiet
of
the
wolfswood
at
night.

And
yet,
the
thought
of
leaving
angered
him
as
well.
So
much
was
still
undone.
Robert
and
his
council
of
cravens
and
flatterers
would
beggar
the
realm
if
left
unchecked…
or,
worse,
sell
it
to
the
Lannisters
in
payment
of
their
loans.
And
the
truth
of
Jon
Arryn’s
death
still
eluded
him.
Oh,
he
had
found
a
few
pieces,
enough
to
convince
him
that
Jon
had
indeed
been
murdered,
but
that
was
no
more
than
the
spoor
of
an
animal
on
the
forest
floor.
He
had
not
sighted
the
beast
itself
yet,
though
he
sensed
it
was
there,
lurking,
hidden,
treacherous.

It
struck
him
suddenly
that
he
might
return
to
Winterfell
by
sea.
Ned
was
no
sailor,
and
ordinarily
would
have
preferred
the
kingsroad,
but
if
he
took
ship
he
could
stop
at
Dragonstone
and
speak
with
Stannis
Baratheon.
Pycelle
had
sent
a
raven
off
across
the
water,
with
a
polite
letter
from
Ned
requesting
Lord
Stannis
to
return
to
his
seat
on
the
small
council.
As
yet,
there
had
been
no
reply,
but
the
silence
only
deepened
his
suspicions.
Lord
Stannis
shared
the
secret
Jon
Arryn
had
died
for,
he
was
certain
of
it.
The
truth
he
sought
might
very
well
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
ancient
island
fortress
of
House
Targaryen.

And
when
you
have
it,
what
then?
Some
secrets
are
safer
kept
hidden.
Some
secrets
are
too
dangerous
to
share,
even
with
those
you
love
and
trust.
Ned
slid
the
dagger
that
Catelyn
had
brought
him
out
of
the
sheath
on
his
belt.
The
Imp’s
knife.
Why
would
the
dwarf
want
Bran
dead?
To
silence
him,
surely.
Another
secret,
or
only
a
different
strand
of
the
same
web?

Could
Robert
be
part
of
it?
He
would
not
have
thought
so,
but
once
he
would
not
have
thought
Robert
could
command
the
murder
of
women
and
children
either.
Catelyn
had
tried
to
warn
him.
You
knew
the
man,
she
had
said.
The
king
is
a
stranger
to
you.
The
sooner
he
was
quit
of
King’s
Landing,
the
better.
If
there
was
a
ship
sailing
north
on
the
morrow,
it
would
be
well
to
be
on
it.

He
summoned
Vayon
Poole
again
and
sent
him
to
the
docks
to
make
inquiries,
quietly
but
quickly.
“Find
me
a
fast
ship
with
a
skilled
captain,”
he
told
the
steward.
“I
care
nothing
for
the
size
of
its
cabins
or
the
quality
of
its
appointments,
so
long
as
it
is
swift
and
safe.
I
wish
to
leave
at
once.”

Poole
had
no
sooner
taken
his
leave
than
Tomard
announced
a
visitor.
“Lord
Baelish
to
see
you,
m’lord.”

Ned
was
half-tempted
to
turn
him
away,
but
thought
better
of
it.
He
was
not
free
yet;
until
he
was,
he
must
play
their
games.
“Show
him
in,
Tom.”

Lord
Petyr
sauntered
into
the
solar
as
if
nothing
had
gone
amiss
that
morning.
He
wore
a
slashed
velvet
doublet
in
cream-and-silver,
a
grey
silk
cloak
trimmed
with
black
fox,
and
his
customary
mocking
smile.

Ned
greeted
him
coldly.
“Might
I
ask
the
reason
for
this
visit,
Lord
Baelish?”

“I
won’t
detain
you
long,
I’m
on
my
way
to
dine
with
Lady
Tanda.
Lamprey
pie
and
roast
suckling
pig.
She
has
some
thought
to
wed
me
to
her
younger
daughter,
so
her
table
is
always
astonishing.
If
truth
be
told,
I’d
sooner
marry
the
pig,
but
don’t
tell
her.
I
do
love
lamprey
pie.”

“Don’t
let
me
keep
you
from
your
eels,
my
lord,”
Ned
said
with
icy
disdain.
“At
the
moment,
I
cannot
think
of
anyone
whose
company
I
desire
less
than
yours.”

“Oh,
I’m
certain
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it,
you
could
come
up
with
a
few
names.
Varys,
say.
Cersei.
Or
Robert.
His
Grace
is
most
wroth
with
you.
He
went
on
about
you
at
some
length
after
you
took
your
leave
of
us
this
morning.
The
words
insolence
and
ingratitude
came
into
it
frequently,
I
seem
to
recall.”

Ned
did
not
honor
that
with
a
reply.
Nor
did
he
offer
his
guest
a
seat,
but
Littlefinger
took
one
anyway.
“After
you
stormed
out,
it
was
left
to
me
to
convince
them
not
to
hire
the
Faceless
Men,”
he
continued
blithely.
“Instead
Varys
will
quietly
let
it
be
known
that
we’ll
make
a
lord
of
whoever
does
in
the
Targaryen
girl.”

Ned
was
disgusted.
“So
now
we
grant
titles
to
assassins.”

Littlefinger
shrugged.
“Titles
are
cheap.
The
Faceless
Men
are
expensive.
If
truth
be
told,
I
did
the
Targaryen
girl
more
good
than
you
with
all
your
talk
of
honor.
Let
some
sellsword
drunk
on
visions
of
lordship
try
to
kill
her.
Likely
he’ll
make
a
botch
of
it,
and
afterward
the
Dothraki
will
be
on
their
guard.
If
we’d
sent
a
Faceless
Man
after
her,
she’d
be
as
good
as
buried.”

Ned
frowned.
“You
sit
in
council
and
talk
of
ugly
women
and
steel
kisses,
and
now
you
expect
me
to
believe
that
you
tried
to
protect
the
girl?
How
big
a
fool
do
you
take
me
for?”

“Well,
quite
an
enormous
one,
actually,”
said
Littlefinger,
laughing.

“Do
you
always
find
murder
so
amusing,
Lord
Baelish?”

“It’s
not
murder
I
find
amusing,
Lord
Stark,
it’s
you.
You
rule
like
a
man
dancing
on
rotten
ice.
I
daresay
you
will
make
a
noble
splash.
I
believe
I
heard
the
first
crack
this
morning.”

“The
first
and
last,”
said
Ned.
“I’ve
had
my
fill.”

“When
do
you
mean
to
return
to
Winterfell,
my
lord?”

“As
soon
as
I
can.
What
concern
is
that
of
yours?”

“None…
but
if
perchance
you’re
still
here
come
evenfall,
I’d
be
pleased
to
take
you
to
this
brothel
your
man
Jory
has
been
searching
for
so
ineffectually.”
Littlefinger
smiled.
“And
I
won’t
even
tell
the
Lady
Catelyn.”





CATELYN

“My
lady,
you
should
have
sent
word
of
your
coming,”
Ser
Donnel
Waynwood
told
her
as
their
horses
climbed
the
pass.
“We
would
have
sent
an
escort.
The
high
road
is
not
as
safe
as
it
once
was,
for
a
party
as
small
as
yours.”

“We
learned
that
to
our
sorrow,
Ser
Donnel,”
Catelyn
said.
Sometimes
she
felt
as
though
her
heart
had
turned
to
stone;
six
brave
men
had
died
to
bring
her
this
far,
and
she
could
not
even
find
it
in
her
to
weep
for
them.
Even
their
names
were
fading.
“The
clansmen
harried
us
day
and
night.
We
lost
three
men
in
the
first
attack,
and
two
more
in
the
second,
and
Lannister’s
serving
man
died
of
a
fever
when
his
wounds
festered.
When
we
heard
your
men
approaching,
I
thought
us
doomed
for
certain.”
They
had
drawn
up
for
a
last
desperate
fight,
blades
in
hand
and
backs
to
the
rock.
The
dwarf
had
been
whetting
the
edge
of
his
axe
and
making
some
mordant
jest
when
Bronn
spotted
the
banner
the
riders
carried
before
them,
the
moon-and-falcon
of
House
Arryn,
sky-blue
and
white.
Catelyn
had
never
seen
a
more
welcome
sight.

“The
clans
have
grown
bolder
since
Lord
Jon
died,”
Ser
Donnel
said.
He
was
a
stocky
youth
of
twenty
years,
earnest
and
homely,
with
a
wide
nose
and
a
shock
of
thick
brown
hair.
“If
it
were
up
to
me,
I
would
take
a
hundred
men
into
the
mountains,
root
them
out
of
their
fastnesses,
and
teach
them
some
sharp
lessons,
but
your
sister
has
forbidden
it.
She
would
not
even
permit
her
knights
to
fight
in
the
Hand’s
tourney.
She
wants
all
our
swords
kept
close
to
home,
to
defend
the
Vale…
against
what,
no
one
is
certain.
Shadows,
some
say.”
He
looked
at
her
anxiously,
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
who
she
was.
“I
hope
I
have
not
spoken
out
of
turn,
my
lady.
I
meant
no
offense.”

“Frank
talk
does
not
offend
me,
Ser
Donnel.”
Catelyn
knew
what
her
sister
feared.
Not
shadows,
Lannisters,
she
thought
to
herself,
glancing
back
to
where
the
dwarf
rode
beside
Bronn.
The
two
of
them
had
grown
thick
as
thieves
since
Chiggen
had
died.
The
little
man
was
more
cunning
than
she
liked.
When
they
had
entered
the
mountains,
he
had
been
her
captive,
bound
and
helpless.
What
was
he
now?
Her
captive
still,
yet
he
rode
along
with
a
dirk
through
his
belt
and
an
axe
strapped
to
his
saddle,
wearing
the
shadowskin
cloak
he’d
won
dicing
with
the
singer
and
the
chainmail
hauberk
he’d
taken
off
Chiggen’s
corpse.
Two
score
men
flanked
the
dwarf
and
the
rest
of
her
ragged
band,
knights
and
men-at-arms
in
service
to
her
sister
Lysa
and
Jon
Arryn’s
young
son,
and
yet
Tyrion
betrayed
no
hint
of
fear.
Could
I
be
wrong?
Catelyn
wondered,
not
for
the
first
time.
Could
he
be
innocent
after
all,
of
Bran
and
Jon
Arryn
and
all
the
rest?
And
if
he
was,
what
did
that
make
her?
Six
men
had
died
to
bring
him
here.

Resolute,
she
pushed
her
doubts
away.
“When
we
reach
your
keep,
I
would
take
it
kindly
if
you
could
send
for
Maester
Colemon
at
once.
Ser
Rodrik
is
feverish
from
his
wounds.”
More
than
once
she
had
feared
the
gallant
old
knight
would
not
survive
the
journey.
Toward
the
end
he
could
scarcely
sit
his
horse,
and
Bronn
had
urged
her
to
leave
him
to
his
fate,
but
Catelyn
would
not
hear
of
it.
They
had
tied
him
in
the
saddle
instead,
and
she
had
commanded
Marillion
the
singer
to
watch
over
him.

Ser
Donnel
hesitated
before
he
answered.
“The
Lady
Lysa
has
commanded
the
maester
to
remain
at
the
Eyrie
at
all
times,
to
care
for
Lord
Robert,”
he
said.
“We
have
a
septon
at
the
gate
who
tends
to
our
wounded.
He
can
see
to
your
man’s
hurts.”

Catelyn
had
more
faith
in
a
maester’s
learning
than
a
septon’s
prayers.
She
was
about
to
say
as
much
when
she
saw
the
battlements
ahead,
long
parapets
built
into
the
very
stone
of
the
mountains
on
either
side
of
them.
Where
the
pass
shrank
to
a
narrow
defile
scarce
wide
enough
for
four
men
to
ride
abreast,
twin
watchtowers
clung
to
the
rocky
slopes,
joined
by
a
covered
bridge
of
weathered
grey
stone
that
arched
above
the
road.
Silent
faces
watched
from
arrow
slits
in
tower,
battlements,
and
bridge.
When
they
had
climbed
almost
to
the
top,
a
knight
rode
out
to
meet
them.
His
horse
and
his
armor
were
grey,
but
his
cloak
was
the
rippling
blue-and-red
of
Riverrun,
and
a
shiny
black
fish,
wrought
in
gold
and
obsidian,
pinned
its
folds
against
his
shoulder.
“Who
would
pass
the
Bloody
Gate?”
he
called.

“Ser
Donnel
Waynwood,
with
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
and
her
companions,”
the
young
knight
answered.

The
Knight
of
the
Gate
lifted
his
visor.
“I
thought
the
lady
looked
familiar.
You
are
far
from
home,
little
Cat.”

“And
you,
Uncle,”
she
said,
smiling
despite
all
she
had
been
through.
Hearing
that
hoarse,
smoky
voice
again
took
her
back
twenty
years,
to
the
days
of
her
childhood.

“My
home
is
at
my
back,”
he
said
gruffly.

“Your
home
is
in
my
heart,”
Catelyn
told
him.
“Take
off
your
helm.
I
would
look
on
your
face
again.”

“The
years
have
not
improved
it,
I
fear,”
Brynden
Tully
said,
but
when
he
lifted
off
the
helm,
Catelyn
saw
that
he
lied.
His
features
were
lined
and
weathered,
and
time
had
stolen
the
auburn
from
his
hair
and
left
him
only
grey,
but
the
smile
was
the
same,
and
the
bushy
eyebrows
fat
as
caterpillars,
and
the
laughter
in
his
deep
blue
eyes.
“Did
Lysa
know
you
were
coming?”

“There
was
no
time
to
send
word
ahead,”
Catelyn
told
him.
The
others
were
coming
up
behind
her.
“I
fear
we
ride
before
the
storm,
Uncle.”

“May
we
enter
the
Vale?”
Ser
Donnel
asked.
The
Waynwoods
were
ever
ones
for
ceremony.

“In
the
name
of
Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
Defender
of
the
Vale,
True
Warden
of
the
East,
I
bid
you
enter
freely,
and
charge
you
to
keep
his
peace,”
Ser
Brynden
replied.
“Come.”

And
so
she
rode
behind
him,
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Bloody
Gate
where
a
dozen
armies
had
dashed
themselves
to
pieces
in
the
Age
of
Heroes.
On
the
far
side
of
the
stoneworks,
the
mountains
opened
up
suddenly
upon
a
vista
of
green
fields,
blue
sky,
and
snowcapped
mountains
that
took
her
breath
away.
The
Vale
of
Arryn
bathed
in
the
morning
light.

It
stretched
before
them
to
the
misty
cast,
a
tranquil
land
of
rich
black
soil,
wide
slow-moving
rivers,
and
hundreds
of
small
lakes
that
shone
like
mirrors
in
the
sun,
protected
on
all
sides
by
its
sheltering
peaks.
Wheat
and
corn
and
barley
grew
high
in
its
fields,
and
even
in
Highgarden
the
pumpkins
were
no
larger
nor
the
fruit
any
sweeter
than
here.
They
stood
at
the
western
end
of
the
valley,
where
the
high
road
crested
the
last
pass
and
began
its
winding
descent
to
the
bottomlands
two
miles
below.
The
Vale
was
narrow
here,
no
more
than
a
half
day’s
ride
across,
and
the
northern
mountains
seemed
so
close
that
Catelyn
could
almost
reach
out
and
touch
them.
Looming
over
them
all
was
the
jagged
peak
called
the
Giant’s
Lance,
a
mountain
that
even
mountains
looked
up
to,
its
head
lost
in
icy
mists
three
and
a
half
miles
above
the
valley
floor.
Over
its
massive
western
shoulder
flowed
the
ghost
torrent
of
Alyssa’s
Tears.
Even
from
this
distance,
Catelyn
could
make
out
the
shining
silver
thread,
bright
against
the
dark
stone.

When
her
uncle
saw
that
she
had
stopped,
he
moved
his
horse
closer
and
pointed.
“It’s
there,
beside
Alyssa’s
Tears.
All
you
can
see
from
here
is
a
flash
of
white
every
now
and
then,
if
you
look
hard
and
the
sun
hits
the
walls
just
right.”

Seven
towers,
Ned
had
told
her,
like
white
daggers
thrust
into
the
belly
of
the
sky,
so
high
you
can
stand
on
the
parapets
and
look
down
on
the
clouds.
“How
long
a
ride?”
she
asked.

“We
can
be
at
the
mountain
by
evenfall,”
Uncle
Brynden
said,
“but
the
climb
will
take
another
day.”

Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
spoke
up
from
behind.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
“I
fear
I
can
go
no
farther
today.”
His
face
sagged
beneath
his
ragged,
newgrown
whiskers,
and
he
looked
so
weary
Catelyn
feared
he
might
fall
off
his
horse.

“Nor
should
you,”
she
said.
“You
have
done
all
I
could
have
asked
of
you,
and
a
hundred
times
more.
My
uncle
will
see
me
the
rest
of
the
way
to
the
Eyrie.
Lannister
must
come
with
me,
but
there
is
no
reason
that
you
and
the
others
should
not
rest
here
and
recover
your
strength.”

“We
should
be
honored
to
have
them
to
guest,”
Ser
Donnel
said
with
the
grave
courtesy
of
the
young.
Beside
Ser
Rodrik,
only
Bronn,
Ser
Willis
Wode,
and
Marillion
the
singer
remained
of
the
party
that
had
ridden
with
her
from
the
inn
by
the
crossroads.

“My
lady,”
Marillion
said,
riding
forward.
“I
beg
you
allow
me
to
accompany
you
to
the
Eyrie,
to
see
the
end
of
the
tale
as
I
saw
its
beginnings.”
The
boy
sounded
haggard,
yet
strangely
determined;
he
had
a
fevered
shine
to
his
eyes.

Catelyn
had
never
asked
the
singer
to
ride
with
them;
that
choice
he
had
made
himself,
and
how
he
had
come
to
survive
the
journey
when
so
many
braver
men
lay
dead
and
unburied
behind
them,
she
could
never
say.
Yet
here
he
was,
with
a
scruff
of
beard
that
made
him
look
almost
a
man.
Perhaps
she
owed
him
something
for
having
come
this
far.
“Very
well,”
she
told
him.

“I’ll
come
as
well,”
Bronn
announced.

She
liked
that
less
well.
Without
Bronn
she
would
never
have
reached
the
Vale,
she
knew;
the
sellsword
was
as
fierce
a
fighter
as
she
had
ever
seen,
and
his
sword
had
helped
cut
them
through
to
safety.
Yet
for
all
that,
Catelyn
misliked
the
man.
Courage
he
had,
and
strength,
but
there
was
no
kindness
in
him,
and
little
loyalty.
And
she
had
seen
him
riding
beside
Lannister
far
too
often,
talking
in
low
voices
and
laughing
at
some
private
joke.
She
would
have
preferred
to
separate
him
from
the
dwarf
here
and
now,
but
having
agreed
that
Marillion
might
continue
to
the
Eyrie,
she
could
see
no
gracious
way
to
deny
that
same
right
to
Bronn.
“As
you
wish,”
she
said,
although
she
noted
that
he
had
not
actually
asked
her
permission.

Ser
Willis
Wode
remained
with
Ser
Rodrik,
a
soft-spoken
septon
fussing
over
their
wounds.
Their
horses
were
left
behind
as
well,
poor
ragged
things.
Ser
Donnel
promised
to
send
birds
ahead
to
the
Eyrie
and
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
with
the
word
of
their
coming.
Fresh
mounts
were
brought
forth
from
the
stables,
surefooted
mountain
stock
with
shaggy
coats,
and
within
the
hour
they
set
forth
once
again.
Catelyn
rode
beside
her
uncle
as
they
began
the
descent
to
the
valley
floor.
Behind
came
Bronn,
Tyrion
Lannister,
Marillion,
and
six
of
Brynden’s
men.

Not
until
they
were
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
mountain
path,
well
out
of
earshot
of
the
others,
did
Brynden
Tully
turn
to
her
and
say,
“So,
child.
Tell
me
about
this
storm
of
yours.”

“I
have
not
been
a
child
in
many
years,
Uncle,”
Catelyn
said,
but
she
told
him
nonetheless.
It
took
longer
than
she
would
have
believed
to
tell
it
all,
Lysa’s
letter
and
Bran’s
fall,
the
assassin’s
dagger
and
Littlefinger
and
her
chance
meeting
with
Tyrion
Lannister
in
the
crossroads
inn.

Her
uncle
listened
silently,
heavy
brows
shadowing
his
eyes
as
his
frown
grew
deeper.
Brynden
Tully
had
always
known
how
to
listen…
to
anyone
but
her
father.
He
was
Lord
Hoster’s
brother,
younger
by
five
years,
but
the
two
of
them
had
been
at
war
as
far
back
as
Catelyn
could
remember.
During
one
of
their
louder
quarrels,
when
Catelyn
was
eight,
Lord
Hoster
had
called
Brynden
“the
black
goat
of
the
Tully
flock.”
Laughing,
Brynden
had
pointed
out
that
the
sigil
of
their
house
was
a
leaping
trout,
so
he
ought
to
be
a
black
fish
rather
than
a
black
goat,
and
from
that
day
forward
he
had
taken
it
as
his
personal
emblem.

The
war
had
not
ended
until
the
day
she
and
Lysa
had
been
wed.
It
was
at
their
wedding
feast
that
Brynden
told
his
brother
he
was
leaving
Riverrun
to
serve
Lysa
and
her
new
husband,
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie.
Lord
Hoster
had
not
spoken
his
brother’s
name
since,
from
what
Edmure
told
her
in
his
infrequent
letters.

Nonetheless,
during
all
those
years
of
Catelyn’s
girlhood,
it
had
been
Brynden
the
Blackfish
to
whom
Lord
Hoster’s
children
had
run
with
their
tears
and
their
tales,
when
Father
was
too
busy
and
Mother
too
ill.
Catelyn,
Lysa,
Edmure…
and
yes,
even
Petyr
Baelish,
their
father’s
ward…
he
had
listened
to
them
all
patiently,
as
he
listened
now,
laughing
at
their
triumphs
and
sympathizing
with
their
childish
misfortunes.

When
she
was
done,
her
uncle
remained
silent
for
a
long
time,
as
his
horse
negotiated
the
steep,
rocky
trail.
“Your
father
must
be
told,”
he
said
at
last.
“If
the
Lannisters
should
march,
Winterfell
is
remote
and
the
Vale
walled
up
behind
its
mountains,
but
Riverrun
lies
right
in
their
path.”

“I’d
had
the
same
fear,”
Catelyn
admitted.
“I
shall
ask
Maester
Colemon
to
send
a
bird
when
we
reach
the
Eyrie.”
She
had
other
messages
to
send
as
well;
the
commands
that
Ned
had
given
her
for
his
bannermen,
to
ready
the
defenses
of
the
north.
“What
is
the
mood
in
the
Vale?”
she
asked.

“Angry,”
Brynden
Tully
admitted.
“Lord
Jon
was
much
loved,
and
the
insult
was
keenly
felt
when
the
king
named
Jaime
Lannister
to
an
office
the
Arryns
had
held
for
near
three
hundred
years.
Lysa
has
commanded
us
to
call
her
son
the
True
Warden
of
the
East,
but
no
one
is
fooled.
Nor
is
your
sister
alone
in
wondering
at
the
manner
of
the
Hand’s
death.
None
dare
say
Jon
was
murdered,
not
openly,
but
suspicion
casts
a
long
shadow.”
He
gave
Catelyn
a
look,
his
mouth
tight.
“And
there
is
the
boy.”

“The
boy?
What
of
him?”
She
ducked
her
head
as
they
passed
under
a
low
overhang
of
rock,
and
around
a
sharp
turn.

Her
uncle’s
voice
was
troubled.
“Lord
Robert,”
he
sighed.
“Six
years
old,
sickly,
and
prone
to
weep
if
you
take
his
dolls
away.
Jon
Arryn’s
trueborn
heir,
by
all
the
gods,
yet
there
are
some
who
say
he
is
too
weak
to
sit
his
father’s
seat,
Nestor
Royce
has
been
high
steward
these
past
fourteen
years,
while
Lord
Jon
served
in
King’s
Landing,
and
many
whisper
that
he
should
rule
until
the
boy
comes
of
age.
Others
believe
that
Lysa
must
marry
again,
and
soon.
Already
the
suitors
gather
like
crows
on
a
battlefield.
The
Eyrie
is
full
of
them.”

“I
might
have
expected
that,”
Catelyn
said.
Small
wonder
there;
Lysa
was
still
young,
and
the
kingdom
of
Mountain
and
Vale
made
a
handsome
wedding
gift.
“Will
Lysa
take
another
husband?”

“She
says
yes,
provided
she
finds
a
man
who
suits
her,”
Brynden
Tully
said,
“but
she
has
already
rejected
Lord
Nestor
and
a
dozen
other
suitable
men.
She
swears
that
this
time
she
will
choose
her
lord
husband.”

“You
of
all
people
can
scarce
fault
her
for
that.”

Ser
Brynden
snorted.
“Nor
do
I,
but…
it
seems
to
me
Lysa
is
only
playing
at
courtship.
She
enjoys
the
sport,
but
I
believe
your
sister
intends
to
rule
herself
until
her
boy
is
old
enough
to
be
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
in
truth
as
well
as
name.”

“A
woman
can
rule
as
wisely
as
a
man,”
Catelyn
said.

“The
right
woman
can,”
her
uncle
said
with
a
sideways
glance.
“Make
no
mistake,
Cat.
Lysa
is
not
you.”
He
hesitated
a
moment.
“If
truth
be
told,
I
fear
you
may
not
find
your
sister
as
helpful
as
you
would
like.”

She
was
puzzled.
“What
do
you
mean?”

“The
Lysa
who
came
back
from
King’s
Landing
is
not
the
same
girl
who
went
south
when
her
husband
was
named
Hand.
Those
years
were
hard
for
her.
You
must
know.
Lord
Arryn
was
a
dutiful
husband,
but
their
marriage
was
made
from
politics,
not
passion.”

“As
was
my
own.”

“They
began
the
same,
but
your
ending
has
been
happier
than
your
sister’s.
Two
babes
stillborn,
twice
as
many
miscarriages,
Lord
Arryn’s
death…
Catelyn,
the
gods
gave
Lysa
only
the
one
child,
and
he
is
all
your
sister
lives
for
now,
poor
boy.
Small
wonder
she
fled
rather
than
see
him
handed
over
to
the
Lannisters.
Your
sister
is
afraid,
child,
and
the
Lannisters
are
what
she
fears
most.
She
ran
to
the
Vale,
stealing
away
from
the
Red
Keep
like
a
thief
in
the
night,
and
all
to
snatch
her
son
out
of
the
lion’s
mouth…
and
now
you
have
brought
the
lion
to
her
door.”

“In
chains,”
Catelyn
said.
A
crevasse
yawned
on
her
right,
falling
away
into
darkness.
She
reined
up
her
horse
and
picked
her
way
along
step
by
careful
step.

“Oh?”
Her
uncle
glanced
back,
to
where
Tyrion
Lannister
was
making
his
slow
descent
behind
them.
“I
see
an
axe
on
his
saddle,
a
dirk
at
his
belt,
and
a
sellsword
that
trails
after
him
like
a
hungry
shadow.
Where
are
the
chains,
sweet
one?”

Catelyn
shifted
uneasily
in
her
seat.
“The
dwarf
is
here,
and
not
by
choice.
Chains
or
no,
he
is
my
prisoner.
Lysa
will
want
him
to
answer
for
his
crimes
no
less
than
I.
It
was
her
own
lord
husband
the
Lannisters
murdered,
and
her
own
letter
that
first
warned
us
against
them.”

Brynden
Blackfish
gave
her
a
weary
smile.
“I
hope
you
are
right,
child,”
he
sighed,
in
tones
that
said
she
was
wrong.

The
sun
was
well
to
the
west
by
the
time
the
slope
began
to
flatten
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
horses.
The
road
widened
and
grew
straight,
and
for
the
first
time
Catelyn
noticed
wildflowers
and
grasses
growing.
Once
they
reached
the
valley
floor,
the
going
was
faster
and
they
made
good
time,
cantering
through
verdant
greenwoods
and
sleepy
little
hamlets,
past
orchards
and
golden
wheat
fields,
splashing
across
a
dozen
sunlit
streams.
Her
uncle
sent
a
standard-bearer
ahead
of
them,
a
double
banner
flying
from
his
staff;
the
moon-and-falcon
of
House
Arryn
on
high,
and
below
it
his
own
black
fish.
Farm
wagons
and
merchants’
carts
and
riders
from
lesser
houses
moved
aside
to
let
them
pass.

Even
so,
it
was
full
dark
before
they
reached
the
stout
castle
that
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
Torches
flickered
atop
its
ramparts,
and
the
horned
moon
danced
upon
the
dark
waters
of
its
moat.
The
drawbridge
was
up
and
the
portcullis
down,
but
Catelyn
saw
lights
burning
in
the
gatehouse
and
spilling
from
the
windows
of
the
square
towers
beyond.

“The
Gates
of
the
Moon,”
her
uncle
said
as
the
party
drew
rein.
His
standard-bearer
rode
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
to
hail
the
men
in
the
gatehouse.
“Lord
Nestor’s
seat.
He
should
be
expecting
us.
Look
up.”

Catelyn
raised
her
eyes,
up
and
up
and
up.
At
first
all
she
saw
was
stone
and
trees,
the
looming
mass
of
the
great
mountain
shrouded
in
night,
as
black
as
a
starless
sky.
Then
she
noticed
the
glow
of
distant
fires
well
above
them;
a
tower
keep,
built
upon
the
steep
side
of
the
mountain,
its
lights
like
orange
eyes
staring
down
from
above.
Above
that
was
another,
higher
and
more
distant,
and
still
higher
a
third,
no
more
than
a
flickering
spark
in
the
sky.
And
finally,
up
where
the
falcons
soared,
a
flash
of
white
in
the
moonlight.
Vertigo
washed
over
her
as
she
stared
upward
at
the
pale
towers,
so
far
above.

“The
Eyrie,”
she
heard
Marillion
murmur,
awed.

The
sharp
voice
of
Tyrion
Lannister
broke
in.
“The
Arryns
must
not
be
overfond
of
company.
If
you’re
planning
to
make
us
climb
that
mountain
in
the
dark,
I’d
rather
you
kill
me
here.”

“We’ll
spend
the
night
here
and
make
the
ascent
on
the
morrow,”
Brynden
told
him.

“I
can
scarcely
wait,”
the
dwarf
replied.
“How
do
we
get
up
there?
I’ve
no
experience
at
riding
goats.”

“Mules,”
Brynden
said,
smiling.

“There
are
steps
carved
into
the
mountain,”
Catelyn
said.
Ned
had
told
her
about
them
when
he
talked
of
his
youth
here
with
Robert
Baratheon
and
Jon
Arryn.

Her
uncle
nodded.
“It
is
too
dark
to
see
them,
but
the
steps
are
there.
Too
steep
and
narrow
for
horses,
but
mules
can
manage
them
most
of
the
way.
The
path
is
guarded
by
three
waycastles,
Stone
and
Snow
and
Sky.
The
mules
will
take
us
as
far
up
as
Sky.”

Tyrion
Lannister
glanced
up
doubtfully.
“And
beyond
that?”

Brynden
smiled.
“Beyond
that,
the
path
is
too
steep
even
for
mules.
We
ascend
on
foot
the
rest
of
the
way.
Or
perchance
you’d
prefer
to
ride
a
basket.
The
Eyrie
clings
to
the
mountain
directly
above
Sky,
and
in
its
cellars
are
six
great
winches
with
long
iron
chains
to
draw
supplies
up
from
below.
If
you
prefer,
my
lord
of
Lannister,
I
can
arrange
for
you
to
ride
up
with
the
bread
and
beer
and
apples.”

The
dwarf
gave
a
bark
of
laughter.
“Would
that
I
were
a
pumpkin,”
he
said.
“Alas,
my
lord
father
would
no
doubt
be
most
chagrined
if
his
son
of
Lannister
went
to
his
fate
like
a
load
of
turnips.
If
you
ascend
on
foot,
I
fear
I
must
do
the
same.
We
Lannisters
do
have
a
certain
pride.”

“Pride?”
Catelyn
snapped.
His
mocking
tone
and
easy
manner
made
her
angry.
“Arrogance,
some
might
call
it.
Arrogance
and
avarice
and
lust
for
power.”

“My
brother
is
undoubtedly
arrogant,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied.
“My
father
is
the
soul
of
avarice,
and
my
sweet
sister
Cersei
lusts
for
power
with
every
waking
breath.
I,
however,
am
innocent
as
a
little
lamb.
Shall
I
bleat
for
you?”
He
grinned.

The
drawbridge
came
creaking
down
before
she
could
reply,
and
they
heard
the
sound
of
oiled
chains
as
the
portcullis
was
drawn
up.
Men-at-arms
carried
burning
brands
out
to
light
their
way,
and
her
uncle
led
them
across
the
moat.
Lord
Nestor
Royce,
High
Steward
of
the
Vale
and
Keeper
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon,
was
waiting
in
the
yard
to
greet
them,
surrounded
by
his
knights.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said,
bowing.
He
was
a
massive,
barrel-chested
man,
and
his
bow
was
clumsy.

Catelyn
dismounted
to
stand
before
him.
“Lord
Nestor,”
she
said.
She
knew
the
man
only
by
reputation;
Bronze
Yohn’s
cousin,
from
a
lesser
branch
of
House
Royce,
yet
still
a
formidable
lord
in
his
own
right.
“We
have
had
a
long
and
tiring
journey.
I
would
beg
the
hospitality
of
your
roof
tonight,
if
I
might.”

“My
roof
is
yours,
my
lady,”
Lord
Nestor
returned
gruffly,
“but
your
sister
the
Lady
Lysa
has
sent
down
word
from
the
Eyrie.
She
wishes
to
see
you
at
once.
The
rest
of
your
party
will
be
housed
here
and
sent
up
at
first
light.”

Her
uncle
swung
off
his
horse.
“What
madness
is
this?”
he
said
bluntly.
Brynden
Tully
had
never
been
a
man
to
blunt
the
edge
of
his
words.
“A
night
ascent,
with
the
moon
not
even
full?
Even
Lysa
should
know
that’s
an
invitation
to
a
broken
neck.”

“The
mules
know
the
way,
Ser
Brynden.”
A
wiry
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
stepped
up
beside
Lord
Nestor.
Her
dark
hair
was
cropped
short
and
straight
around
her
head,
and
she
wore
riding
leathers
and
a
light
shirt
of
silvered
ringmail.
She
bowed
to
Catelyn,
more
gracefully
than
her
lord.
“I
promise
you,
my
lady,
no
harm
will
come
to
you.
It
would
be
my
honor
to
take
you
up.
I’ve
made
the
dark
climb
a
hundred
times.
Mychel
says
my
father
must
have
been
a
goat.”

She
sounded
so
cocky
that
Catelyn
had
to
smile.
“Do
you
have
a
name,
child?”

“Mya
Stone,
if
it
please
you,
my
lady,”
the
girl
said.

It
did
not
please
her;
it
was
an
effort
for
Catelyn
to
keep
the
smile
on
her
face.
Stone
was
a
bastard’s
name
in
the
Vale,
as
Snow
was
in
the
north,
and
Flowers
in
Highgarden;
in
each
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
custom
had
fashioned
a
surname
for
children
born
with
no
names
of
their
own.
Catelyn
had
nothing
against
this
girl,
but
suddenly
she
could
not
help
but
think
of
Ned’s
bastard
on
the
Wall,
and
the
thought
made
her
angry
and
guilty,
both
at
once.
She
struggled
to
find
words
for
a
reply.

Lord
Nestor
filled
the
silence.
“Mya’s
a
clever
girl,
and
if
she
vows
she
will
bring
you
safely
to
the
Lady
Lysa,
I
believe
her.
She
has
not
failed
me
yet.”

“Then
I
put
myself
in
your
hands,
Mya
Stone,”
Catelyn
said.
“Lord
Nestor,
I
charge
you
to
keep
a
close
guard
on
my
prisoner.”

“And
I
charge
you
to
bring
the
prisoner
a
cup
of
wine
and
a
nicely
crisped
capon,
before
he
dies
of
hunger,”
Lannister
said.
“A
girl
would
be
pleasant
as
well,
but
I
suppose
that’s
too
much
to
ask
of
you.”
The
sellsword
Bronn
laughed
aloud.

Lord
Nestor
ignored
the
banter.
“As
you
say,
my
lady,
so
it
will
be
done.”
Only
then
did
he
look
at
the
dwarf.
“See
our
lord
of
Lannister
to
a
tower
cell,
and
bring
him
meat
and
mead.”

Catelyn
took
her
leave
of
her
uncle
and
the
others
as
Tyrion
Lannister
was
led
off,
then
followed
the
bastard
girl
through
the
castle.
Two
mules
were
waiting
in
the
upper
bailey,
saddled
and
ready.
Mya
helped
her
mount
one
while
a
guardsman
in
a
sky-blue
cloak
opened
the
narrow
postern
gate.
Beyond
was
dense
forest
of
pine
and
spruce,
and
the
mountain
like
a
black
wall,
but
the
steps
were
there,
chiseled
deep
into
the
rock,
ascending
into
the
sky.
“Some
people
find
it
easier
if
they
close
their
eyes,”
Mya
said
as
she
led
the
mules
through
the
gate
into
the
dark
wood.
“When
they
get
frightened
or
dizzy,
sometimes
they
hold
on
to
the
mule
too
tight.
They
don’t
like
that.”

“I
was
born
a
Tully
and
wed
to
a
Stark,”
Catelyn
said.
“I
do
not
frighten
easily.
Do
you
plan
to
light
a
torch?”
The
steps
were
black
as
pitch.

The
girl
made
a
face.
“Torches
just
blind
you.
On
a
clear
night
like
this,
the
moon
and
the
stars
are
enough.
Mychel
says
I
have
the
eyes
of
the
owl.”
She
mounted
and
urged
her
mule
up
the
first
step.
Catelyn’s
animal
followed
of
its
own
accord.

“You
mentioned
Mychel
before,”
Catelyn
said.
The
mules
set
the
pace,
slow
but
steady.
She
was
perfectly
content
with
that.

“Mychel’s
my
love,”
Mya
explained.
“Mychel
Redfort.
He’s
squire
to
Ser
Lyn
Corbray.
We’re
to
wed
as
soon
as
he
becomes
a
knight,
next
year
or
the
year
after.”

She
sounded
so
like
Sansa,
so
happy
and
innocent
with
her
dreams.
Catelyn
smiled,
but
the
smile
was
tinged
with
sadness.
The
Redforts
were
an
old
name
in
the
Vale,
she
knew,
with
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
in
their
veins.
His
love
she
might
be,
but
no
Redfort
would
ever
wed
a
bastard.
His
family
would
arrange
a
more
suitable
match
for
him,
to
a
Corbray
or
a
Waynwood
or
a
Royce,
or
perhaps
a
daughter
of
some
greater
house
outside
the
Vale.
If
Mychel
Redfort
laid
with
this
girl
at
all,
it
would
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
sheet.

The
ascent
was
easier
than
Catelyn
had
dared
hope.
The
trees
pressed
close,
leaning
over
the
path
to
make
a
rustling
green
roof
that
shut
out
even
the
moon,
so
it
seemed
as
though
they
were
moving
up
a
long
black
tunnel.
But
the
mules
were
surefooted
and
tireless,
and
Mya
Stone
did
indeed
seem
blessed
with
night-eyes.
They
plodded
upward,
winding
their
way
back
and
forth
across
the
face
of
the
mountain
as
the
steps
twisted
and
turned.
A
thick
layer
of
fallen
needles
carpeted
the
path,
so
the
shoes
of
their
mules
made
only
the
softest
sound
on
the
rock.
The
quiet
soothed
her,
and
the
gentle
rocking
motion
set
Catelyn
to
swaying
in
her
saddle.
Before
long
she
was
fighting
sleep.

Perhaps
she
did
doze
for
a
moment,
for
suddenly
a
massive
ironbound
gate
was
looming
before
them.
“Stone,”
Mya
announced
cheerily,
dismounting.
Iron
spikes
were
set
along
the
tops
of
formidable
stone
walls,
and
two
fat
round
towers
overtopped
the
keep.
The
gate
swung
open
at
Mya’s
shout.
Inside,
the
portly
knight
who
commanded
the
waycastle
greeted
Mya
by
name
and
offered
them
skewers
of
charred
meat
and
onions
still
hot
from
the
spit.
Catelyn
had
not
realized
how
hungry
she
was.
She
ate
standing
in
the
yard,
as
stablehands
moved
their
saddles
to
fresh
mules.
The
hot
juices
ran
down
her
chin
and
dripped
onto
her
cloak,
but
she
was
too
famished
to
care.

Then
it
was
up
onto
a
new
mule
and
out
again
into
the
starlight.
The
second
part
of
the
ascent
seemed
more
treacherous
to
Catelyn.
The
trail
was
steeper,
the
steps
more
worn,
and
here
and
there
littered
with
pebbles
and
broken
stone.
Mya
had
to
dismount
a
half-dozen
times
to
move
fallen
rocks
from
their
path.
“You
don’t
want
your
mule
to
break
a
leg
up
here,”
she
said.
Catelyn
was
forced
to
agree.
She
could
feel
the
altitude
more
now.
The
trees
were
sparser
up
here,
and
the
wind
blew
more
vigorously,
sharp
gusts
that
tugged
at
her
clothing
and
pushed
her
hair
into
her
eyes.
From
time
to
time
the
steps
doubled
back
on
themselves,
and
she
could
see
Stone
below
them,
and
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
farther
down,
its
torches
no
brighter
than
candles.

Snow
was
smaller
than
Stone,
a
single
fortified
tower
and
a
timber
keep
and
stable
hidden
behind
a
low
wall
of
unmortared
rock.
Yet
it
nestled
against
the
Giant’s
Lance
in
such
a
way
as
to
command
the
entire
stone
stair
above
the
lower
waycastle.
An
enemy
intent
on
the
Eyrie
would
have
to
fight
his
way
from
Stone
step
by
step,
while
rocks
and
arrows
rained
down
from
Snow
above.
The
commander,
an
anxious
young
knight
with
a
pockmarked
face,
offered
bread
and
cheese
and
the
chance
to
warm
themselves
before
his
fire,
but
Mya
declined.
“We
ought
to
keep
going,
my
lady,”
she
said.
“If
it
please
you.”
Catelyn
nodded.

Again
they
were
given
fresh
mules.
Hers
was
white.
Mya
smiled
when
she
saw
him.
“Whitey’s
a
good
one,
my
lady.
Sure
of
foot,
even
on
ice,
but
you
need
to
be
careful.
He’ll
kick
if
he
doesn’t
like
you.”

The
white
mule
seemed
to
like
Catelyn;
there
was
no
kicking,
thank
the
gods.
There
was
no
ice
either,
and
she
was
grateful
for
that
as
well.
“My
mother
says
that
hundreds
of
years
ago,
this
was
where
the
snow
began,”
Mya
told
her.
“It
was
always
white
above
here,
and
the
ice
never
melted.”
She
shrugged.
“I
can’t
remember
ever
seeing
snow
this
far
down
the
mountain,
but
maybe
it
was
that
way
once,
in
the
olden
times.”

So
young,
Catelyn
thought,
trying
to
remember
if
she
had
ever
been
like
that.
The
girl
had
lived
half
her
life
in
summer,
and
that
was
all
she
knew.
Winter
is
coming,
child,
she
wanted
to
tell
her.
The
words
were
on
her
lips;
she
almost
said
them.
Perhaps
she
was
becoming
a
Stark
at
last.

Above
Snow,
the
wind
was
a
living
thing,
howling
around
them
like
a
wolf
in
the
waste,
then
falling
off
to
nothing
as
if
to
lure
them
into
complacency.
The
stars
seemed
brighter
up
here,
so
close
that
she
could
almost
touch
them,
and
the
horned
moon
was
huge
in
the
clear
black
sky.
As
they
climbed,
Catelyn
found
it
was
better
to
look
up
than
down.
The
steps
were
cracked
and
broken
from
centuries
of
freeze
and
thaw
and
the
tread
of
countless
mules,
and
even
in
the
dark
the
heights
put
her
heart
in
her
throat.
When
they
came
to
a
high
saddle
between
two
spires
of
rock,
Mya
dismounted.
“It’s
best
to
lead
the
mules
over,”
she
said.
“The
wind
can
be
a
little
scary
here,
my
lady.”

Catelyn
climbed
stiffly
from
the
shadows
and
looked
at
the
path
ahead;
twenty
feet
long
and
close
to
three
feet
wide,
but
with
a
precipitous
drop
to
either
side.
She
could
hear
the
wind
shrieking.
Mya
stepped
lightly
out,
her
mule
following
as
calmly
as
if
they
were
crossing
a
bailey.
It
was
her
turn.
Yet
no
sooner
had
she
taken
her
first
step
than
fear
caught
Catelyn
in
its
jaws.
She
could
feel
the
emptiness,
the
vast
black
gulfs
of
air
that
yawned
around
her.
She
stopped,
trembling,
afraid
to
move.
The
wind
screamed
at
her
and
wrenched
at
her
cloak,
trying
to
pull
her
over
the
edge.
Catelyn
edged
her
foot
backward,
the
most
timid
of
steps,
but
the
mule
was
behind
her,
and
she
could
not
retreat.
I
am
going
to
die
here,
she
thought.
She
could
feel
cold
sweat
trickling
down
her
back.

“Lady
Stark,”
Mya
called
across
the
gulf.
The
girl
sounded
a
thousand
leagues
away.
“Are
you
well?”

Catelyn
Tully
Stark
swallowed
what
remained
of
her
pride.
“I…
I
cannot
do
this,
child,”
she
called
out.

“Yes
you
can,”
the
bastard
girl
said.
“I
know
you
can.
Look
how
wide
the
path
is.”

“I
don’t
want
to
look.”
The
world
seemed
to
be
spinning
around
her,
mountain
and
sky
and
mules,
whirling
like
a
child’s
top.
Catelyn
closed
her
eyes
to
steady
her
ragged
breathing.

“I’ll
come
back
for
you,”
Mya
said.
“Don’t
move,
my
lady.”

Moving
was
about
the
last
thing
Catelyn
was
about
to
do.
She
listened
to
the
skirling
of
the
wind
and
the
scuffling
sound
of
leather
on
stone.
Then
Mya
was
there,
taking
her
gently
by
the
arm.
“Keep
your
eyes
closed
if
you
like.
Let
go
of
the
rope
now,
Whitey
will
take
care
of
himself.
Very
good,
my
lady.
I’ll
lead
you
over,
it’s
easy,
you’ll
see.
Give
me
a
step
now.
That’s
it,
move
your
foot,
just
slide
it
forward.
See.
Now
another.
Easy.
You
could
run
across.
Another
one,
go
on.
Yes.”
And
so,
foot
by
foot,
step
by
step,
the
bastard
girl
led
Catelyn
across,
blind
and
trembling,
while
the
white
mule
followed
placidly
behind
them.

The
waycastle
called
Sky
was
no
more
than
a
high,
crescent-shaped
wall
of
unmortared
stone
raised
against
the
side
of
the
mountain,
but
even
the
topless
towers
of
Valyria
could
not
have
looked
more
beautiful
to
Catelyn
Stark.
Here
at
last
the
snow
crown
began;
Sky’s
weathered
stones
were
rimed
with
frost,
and
long
spears
of
ice
hung
from
the
slopes
above.

Dawn
was
breaking
in
the
east
as
Mya
Stone
hallooed
for
the
guards,
and
the
gates
opened
before
them.
Inside
the
walls
there
was
only
a
series
of
ramps
and
a
great
tumble
of
boulders
and
stones
of
all
sizes.
No
doubt
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
begin
an
avalanche
from
here.
A
mouth
yawned
in
the
rock
face
in
front
of
them.
“The
stables
and
barracks
are
in
there,”
Mya
said.
“The
last
part
is
inside
the
mountain.
It
can
be
a
little
dark,
but
at
least
you’re
out
of
the
wind.
This
is
as
far
as
the
mules
can
go.
Past
here,
well,
it’s
a
sort
of
chimney,
more
like
a
stone
ladder
than
proper
steps,
but
it’s
not
too
bad.
Another
hour
and
we’ll
be
there.”

Catelyn
looked
up.
Directly
overhead,
pale
in
the
dawn
light,
she
could
see
the
foundations
of
the
Eyrie.
It
could
not
be
more
than
six
hundred
feet
above
them.
From
below
it
looked
like
a
small
white
honeycomb.
She
remembered
what
her
uncle
had
said
of
baskets
and
winches.
“The
Lannisters
may
have
their
pride,”
she
told
Mya,
“but
the
Tullys
are
born
with
better
sense.
I
have
ridden
all
day
and
the
best
part
of
a
night.
Tell
them
to
lower
a
basket.
I
shall
ride
with
the
turnips.”

The
sun
was
well
above
the
mountains
by
the
time
Catelyn
Stark
finally
reached
the
Eyrie.
A
stocky,
silver-haired
man
in
a
sky-blue
cloak
and
hammered
moon-and-falcon
breastplate
helped
her
from
the
basket;
Ser
Vardis
Egen,
captain
of
Jon
Arryn’s
household
guard.
Beside
him
stood
Maester
Colemon,
thin
and
nervous,
with
too
little
hair
and
too
much
neck.
“Lady
Stark,”
Ser
Vardis
said,
“the
pleasure
is
as
great
as
it
is
unanticipated.”
Maester
Colemon
bobbed
his
head
in
agreement.
“Indeed
it
is,
my
lady,
indeed
it
is.
I
have
sent
word
to
your
sister.
She
left
orders
to
be
awakened
the
instant
you
arrived.”

“I
hope
she
had
a
good
night’s
rest,”
Catelyn
said
with
a
certain
bite
in
her
tone
that
seemed
to
go
unnoticed.

The
men
escorted
her
from
the
winch
room
up
a
spiral
stair.
The
Eyrie
was
a
small
castle
by
the
standards
of
the
great
houses;
seven
slender
white
towers
bunched
as
tightly
as
arrows
in
a
quiver
on
a
shoulder
of
the
great
mountain.
It
had
no
need
of
stables
nor
smithys
nor
kennels,
but
Ned
said
its
granary
was
as
large
as
Winterfell’s,
and
its
towers
could
house
five
hundred
men.
Yet
it
seemed
strangely
deserted
to
Catelyn
as
she
passed
through
it,
its
pale
stone
halls
echoing
and
empty.

Lysa
was
waiting
alone
in
her
solar,
still
clad
in
her
bed
robes.
Her
long
auburn
hair
tumbled
unbound
across
bare
white
shoulders
and
down
her
back.
A
maid
stood
behind
her,
brushing
out
the
night’s
tangles,
but
when
Catelyn
entered,
her
sister
rose
to
her
feet,
smiling.
“Cat,”
she
said.
“Oh,
Cat,
how
good
it
is
to
see
you.
My
sweet
sister.”
She
ran
across
the
chamber
and
wrapped
her
sister
in
her
arms.
“How
long
it
has
been,”
Lysa
murmured
against
her.
“Oh,
how
very
very
long.”

It
had
been
five
years,
in
truth;
five
cruel
years,
for
Lysa.
They
had
taken
their
toll.
Her
sister
was
two
years
the
younger,
yet
she
looked
older
now.
Shorter
than
Catelyn,
Lysa
had
grown
thick
of
body,
pale
and
puffy
of
face.
She
had
the
blue
eyes
of
the
Tullys,
but
hers
were
pale
and
watery,
never
still.
Her
small
mouth
had
turned
petulant.
As
Catelyn
held
her,
she
remembered
the
slender,
high-breasted
girl
who’d
waited
beside
her
that
day
in
the
sept
at
Riverrun.
How
lovely
and
full
of
hope
she
had
been.
All
that
remained
of
her
sister’s
beauty
was
the
great
fall
of
thick
auburn
hair
that
cascaded
to
her
waist.

“You
look
well,”
Catelyn
lied,
“but…
tired.”

Her
sister
broke
the
embrace.
“Tired.
Yes.
Oh,
yes.”
She
seemed
to
notice
the
others
then;
her
maid,
Maester
Colemon,
Ser
Vardis.
“Leave
us,”
she
told
them.
“I
wish
to
speak
to
my
sister
alone.”
She
held
Catelyn’s
hand
as
they
withdrew…

…
and
dropped
it
the
instant
the
door
closed.
Catelyn
saw
her
face
change.
It
was
as
if
the
sun
had
gone
behind
a
cloud.
“Have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses?”
Lysa
snapped
at
her.
“To
bring
him
here,
without
a
word
of
permission,
without
so
much
as
a
warning,
to
drag
us
into
your
quarrels
with
the
Lannisters…”

“My
quarrels?”
Catelyn
could
scarce
believe
what
she
was
hearing.
A
great
fire
burned
in
the
hearth,
but
there
was
no
trace
of
warmth
in
Lysa’s
voice.
“They
were
your
quarrels
first,
sister.
It
was
you
who
sent
me
that
cursed
letter,
you
who
wrote
that
the
Lannisters
had
murdered
your
husband.”

“To
warn
you,
so
you
could
stay
away
from
them!
I
never
meant
to
fight
them!
Gods,
Cat,
do
you
know
what
you’ve
done?”

“Mother?”
a
small
voice
said.
Lysa
whirled,
her
heavy
robe
swirling
around
her.
Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie,
stood
in
the
doorway,
clutching
a
ragged
cloth
doll
and
looking
at
them
with
large
eyes.
He
was
a
painfully
thin
child,
small
for
his
age
and
sickly
all
his
days,
and
from
time
to
time
he
trembled.
The
shaking
sickness,
the
maesters
called
it.
“I
heard
voices.”

Small
wonder,
Catelyn
thought;
Lysa
had
almost
been
shouting.
Still,
her
sister
looked
daggers
at
her.
“This
is
your
aunt
Catelyn,
baby.
My
sister,
Lady
Stark.
Do
you
remember?”

The
boy
glanced
at
her
blankly.
“I
think
so,”
he
said,
blinking,
though
he
had
been
less
than
a
year
old
the
last
time
Catelyn
had
seen
him.

Lysa
seated
herself
near
the
fire
and
said,
“Come
to
Mother,
my
sweet
one.”
She
straightened
his
bedclothes
and
fussed
with
his
fine
brown
hair.
“Isn’t
he
beautiful?
And
strong
too,
don’t
you
believe
the
things
you
hear.
Jon
knew.
The
seed
is
strong,
he
told
me.
His
last
words.
He
kept
saying
Robert’s
name,
and
he
grabbed
my
arm
so
hard
he
left
marks.
Tell
them,
the
seed
is
strong.
His
seed.
He
wanted
everyone
to
know
what
a
good
strong
boy
my
baby
was
going
to
be.”

“Lysa,”
Catelyn
said,
“if
you’re
right
about
the
Lannisters,
all
the
more
reason
we
must
act
quickly.
We—”

“Not
in
front
of
the
baby,”
Lysa
said.
“He
has
a
delicate
temper,
don’t
you,
sweet
one?”

“The
boy
is
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale,”
Catelyn
reminded
her,
“and
these
are
no
times
for
delicacy.
Ned
thinks
it
may
come
to
war.”

“Quiet!”
Lysa
snapped
at
her.
“You’re
scaring
the
boy.”
Little
Robert
took
a
quick
peek
over
his
shoulder
at
Catelyn
and
began
to
tremble.
His
doll
fell
to
the
rushes,
and
he
pressed
himself
against
his
mother.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
my
sweet
baby,”
Lysa
whispered.
“Mother’s
here,
nothing
will
hurt
you.”
She
opened
her
robe
and
drew
out
a
pale,
heavy
breast,
tipped
with
red.
The
boy
grabbed
for
it
eagerly,
buried
his
face
against
her
chest,
and
began
to
suck.
Lysa
stroked
his
hair.

Catelyn
was
at
a
loss
for
words.
Jon
Arryn’s
son,
she
thought
incredulously.
She
remembered
her
own
baby,
three-year-old
Rickon,
half
the
age
of
this
boy
and
five
times
as
fierce.
Small
wonder
the
lords
of
the
Vale
were
restive.
For
the
first
time
she
understood
why
the
king
had
tried
to
take
the
child
away
from
his
mother
to
foster
with
the
Lannisters…

“We’re
safe
here,”
Lysa
was
saying.
Whether
to
her
or
to
the
boy,
Catelyn
was
not
sure.

“Don’t
be
a
fool,”
Catelyn
said,
the
anger
rising
in
her.
“No
one
is
safe.
If
you
think
hiding
here
will
make
the
Lannisters
forget
you,
you
are
sadly
mistaken.”

Lysa
covered
her
boy’s
ear
with
her
hand.
“Even
if
they
could
bring
an
army
through
the
mountains
and
past
the
Bloody
Gate,
the
Eyrie
is
impregnable.
You
saw
for
yourself.
No
enemy
could
ever
reach
us
up
here.”

Catelyn
wanted
to
slap
her.
Uncle
Brynden
had
tried
to
warn
her,
she
realized.
“No
castle
is
impregnable.”

“This
one
is,”
Lysa
insisted.
“Everyone
says
so.
The
only
thing
is,
what
am
I
to
do
with
this
Imp
you
have
brought
me?”

“Is
he
a
bad
man?”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
asked,
his
mother’s
breast
popping
from
his
mouth,
the
nipple
wet
and
red.

“A
very
bad
man,”
Lysa
told
him
as
she
covered
herself,
“but
Mother
won’t
let
him
harm
my
little
baby.”

“Make
him
fly,”
Robert
said
eagerly.

Lysa
stroked
her
son’s
hair.
“Perhaps
we
will,”
she
murmured.
“Perhaps
that
is
just
what
we
will
do.”





EDDARD

He
found
Littlefinger
in
the
brothel’s
common
room,
chatting
amiably
with
a
tall,
elegant
woman
who
wore
a
feathered
gown
over
skin
as
black
as
ink.
By
the
hearth,
Heward
and
a
buxom
wench
were
playing
at
forfeits.
From
the
look
of
it,
he’d
lost
his
belt,
his
cloak,
his
mail
shirt,
and
his
right
boot
so
far,
while
the
girl
had
been
forced
to
unbutton
her
shift
to
the
waist.
Jory
Cassel
stood
beside
a
rain-streaked
window
with
a
wry
smile
on
his
face,
watching
Heward
turn
over
tiles
and
enjoying
the
view.

Ned
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
pulled
on
his
gloves.
“It’s
time
we
took
our
leave.
My
business
here
is
done.”

Heward
lurched
to
his
feet,
hurriedly
gathering
up
his
things.
“As
you
will,
my
lord,”
Jory
said.
“I’ll
help
Wyl
bring
round
the
horses.”
He
strode
to
the
door.

Littlefinger
took
his
time
saying
his
farewells.
He
kissed
the
black
woman’s
hand,
whispered
some
joke
that
made
her
laugh
aloud,
and
sauntered
over
to
Ned.
“Your
business,”
he
said
lightly,
“or
Robert’s?
They
say
the
Hand
dreams
the
king’s
dreams,
speaks
with
the
king’s
voice,
and
rules
with
the
king’s
sword.
Does
that
also
mean
you
fuck
with
the
king’s—”

“Lord
Baelish,”
Ned
interrupted,
“you
presume
too
much.
I
am
not
ungrateful
for
your
help.
It
might
have
taken
us
years
to
find
this
brothel
without
you.
That
does
not
mean
I
intend
to
endure
your
mockery.
And
I
am
no
longer
the
King’s
Hand.”

“The
direwolf
must
be
a
prickly
beast,”
said
Littlefinger
with
a
sharp
twist
of
his
mouth.

A
warm
rain
was
pelting
down
from
a
starless
black
sky
as
they
walked
to
the
stables.
Ned
drew
up
the
hood
of
his
cloak.
Jory
brought
out
his
horse.
Young
Wyl
came
right
behind
him,
leading
Littlefinger’s
mare
with
one
hand
while
the
other
fumbled
with
his
belt
and
the
lacings
of
his
trousers.
A
barefoot
whore
leaned
out
of
the
stable
door,
giggling
at
him.

“Will
we
be
going
back
to
the
castle
now,
my
lord?”
Jory
asked.
Ned
nodded
and
swung
into
the
saddle.
Littlefinger
mounted
up
beside
him.
Jory
and
the
others
followed.

“Chataya
runs
a
choice
establishment,”
Littlefinger
said
as
they
rode.
“I’ve
half
a
mind
to
buy
it.
Brothels
are
a
much
sounder
investment
than
ships,
I’ve
found.
Whores
seldom
sink,
and
when
they
are
boarded
by
pirates,
why,
the
pirates
pay
good
coin
like
everyone
else.”
Lord
Petyr
chuckled
at
his
own
wit.

Ned
let
him
prattle
on.
After
a
time,
he
quieted
and
they
rode
in
silence.
The
streets
of
King’s
Landing
were
dark
and
deserted.
The
rain
had
driven
everyone
under
their
roofs.
It
beat
down
on
Ned’s
head,
warm
as
blood
and
relentless
as
old
guilts.
Fat
drops
of
water
ran
down
his
face.

“Robert
will
never
keep
to
one
bed,”
Lyanna
had
told
him
at
Winterfell,
on
the
night
long
ago
when
their
father
had
promised
her
hand
to
the
young
Lord
of
Storm’s
End.
“I
hear
he
has
gotten
a
child
on
some
girl
in
the
Vale.”
Ned
had
held
the
babe
in
his
arms;
he
could
scarcely
deny
her,
nor
would
he
lie
to
his
sister,
but
he
had
assured
her
that
what
Robert
did
before
their
betrothal
was
of
no
matter,
that
he
was
a
good
man
and
true
who
would
love
her
with
all
his
heart.
Lyanna
had
only
smiled.
“Love
is
sweet,
dearest
Ned,
but
it
cannot
change
a
man’s
nature.”

The
girl
had
been
so
young
Ned
had
not
dared
to
ask
her
age.
No
doubt
she’d
been
a
virgin;
the
better
brothels
could
always
find
a
virgin,
if
the
purse
was
fat
enough.
She
had
light
red
hair
and
a
powdering
of
freckles
across
the
bridge
of
her
nose,
and
when
she
slipped
free
a
breast
to
give
her
nipple
to
the
babe,
he
saw
that
her
bosom
was
freckled
as
well.
“I
named
her
Barra,”
she
said
as
the
child
nursed.
“She
looks
so
like
him,
does
she
not,
milord?
She
has
his
nose,
and
his
hair…”

“She
does.”
Eddard
Stark
had
touched
the
baby’s
fine,
dark
hair.
It
flowed
through
his
fingers
like
black
silk.
Robert’s
firstborn
had
had
the
same
fine
hair,
he
seemed
to
recall.

“Tell
him
that
when
you
see
him,
milord,
as
it…
as
it
please
you.
Tell
him
how
beautiful
she
is.”

“I
will,”
Ned
had
promised
her.
That
was
his
curse.
Robert
would
swear
undying
love
and
forget
them
before
evenfall,
but
Ned
Stark
kept
his
vows.
He
thought
of
the
promises
he’d
made
Lyanna
as
she
lay
dying,
and
the
price
he’d
paid
to
keep
them.

“And
tell
him
I’ve
not
been
with
no
one
else.
I
swear
it,
milord,
by
the
old
gods
and
new.
Chataya
said
I
could
have
half
a
year,
for
the
baby,
and
for
hoping
he’d
come
back.
So
you’ll
tell
him
I’m
waiting,
won’t
you?
I
don’t
want
no
jewels
or
nothing,
just
him.
He
was
always
good
to
me,
truly.”

Good
to
you,
Ned
thought
hollowly.
“I
will
tell
him,
child,
and
I
promise
you,
Barra
shall
not
go
wanting.”

She
had
smiled
then,
a
smile
so
tremulous
and
sweet
that
it
cut
the
heart
out
of
him.
Riding
through
the
rainy
night,
Ned
saw
Jon
Snow’s
face
in
front
of
him,
so
like
a
younger
version
of
his
own.
If
the
gods
frowned
so
on
bastards,
he
thought
dully,
why
did
they
fill
men
with
such
lusts?
“Lord
Baelish,
what
do
you
know
of
Robert’s
bastards?”

“Well,
he
has
more
than
you,
for
a
start.”

“How
many?”

Littlefinger
shrugged.
Rivulets
of
moisture
twisted
down
the
back
of
his
cloak.
“Does
it
matter?
If
you
bed
enough
women,
some
will
give
you
presents,
and
His
Grace
has
never
been
shy
on
that
count.
I
know
he’s
acknowledged
that
boy
at
Storm’s
End,
the
one
he
fathered
the
night
Lord
Stannis
wed.
He
could
hardly
do
otherwise.
The
mother
was
a
Florent,
niece
to
the
Lady
Selyse,
one
of
her
bedmaids.
Renly
says
that
Robert
carried
the
girl
upstairs
during
the
feast,
and
broke
in
the
wedding
bed
while
Stannis
and
his
bride
were
still
dancing.
Lord
Stannis
seemed
to
think
that
was
a
blot
on
the
honor
of
his
wife’s
House,
so
when
the
boy
was
born,
he
shipped
him
off
to
Renly.”
He
gave
Ned
a
sideways
glance.
“I’ve
also
heard
whispers
that
Robert
got
a
pair
of
twins
on
a
serving
wench
at
Casterly
Rock,
three
years
ago
when
he
went
west
for
Lord
Tywin’s
tourney.
Cersei
had
the
babes
killed,
and
sold
the
mother
to
a
passing
slaver.
Too
much
an
affront
to
Lannister
pride,
that
close
to
home.”

Ned
Stark
grimaced.
Ugly
tales
like
that
were
told
of
every
great
lord
in
the
realm.
He
could
believe
it
of
Cersei
Lannister
readily
enough…
but
would
the
king
stand
by
and
let
it
happen?
The
Robert
he
had
known
would
not
have,
but
the
Robert
he
had
known
had
never
been
so
practiced
at
shutting
his
eyes
to
things
he
did
not
wish
to
see.
“Why
would
Jon
Arryn
take
a
sudden
interest
in
the
king’s
baseborn
children?”

The
short
man
gave
a
sodden
shrug.
“He
was
the
King’s
Hand.
Doubtless
Robert
asked
him
to
see
that
they
were
provided
for.”

Ned
was
soaked
through
to
the
bone,
and
his
soul
had
grown
cold.
“It
had
to
be
more
than
that,
or
why
kill
him?”

Littlefinger
shook
the
rain
from
his
hair
and
laughed.
“Now
I
see.
Lord
Arryn
learned
that
His
Grace
had
filled
the
bellies
of
some
whores
and
fishwives,
and
for
that
he
had
to
be
silenced.
Small
wonder.
Allow
a
man
like
that
to
live,
and
next
he’s
like
to
blurt
out
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
east.”

There
was
no
answer
Ned
Stark
could
give
to
that
but
a
frown.
For
the
first
time
in
years,
he
found
himself
remembering
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
He
wondered
if
Rhaegar
had
frequented
brothels;
somehow
he
thought
not.

The
rain
was
falling
harder
now,
stinging
the
eyes
and
drumming
against
the
ground.
Rivers
of
black
water
were
running
down
the
hill
when
Jory
called
out,
“My
lord,”
his
voice
hoarse
with
alarm.
And
in
an
instant,
the
street
was
full
of
soldiers.

Ned
glimpsed
ringmail
over
leather,
gauntlets
and
greaves,
steel
helms
with
golden
lions
on
the
crests.
Their
cloaks
clung
to
their
backs,
sodden
with
rain.
He
had
no
time
to
count,
but
there
were
ten
at
least,
a
line
of
them,
on
foot,
blocking
the
street,
with
longswords
and
iron-tipped
spears.
“Behind!”
he
heard
Wyl
cry,
and
when
he
turned
his
horse,
there
were
more
in
back
of
them,
cutting
off
their
retreat.
Jory’s
sword
came
singing
from
its
scabbard.
“Make
way
or
die!”

“The
wolves
are
howling,”
their
leader
said.
Ned
could
see
rain
running
down
his
face.
“Such
a
small
pack,
though.”

Littlefinger
walked
his
horse
forward,
step
by
careful
step.
“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?
This
is
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

“He
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.”
The
mud
muffled
the
hooves
of
the
blood
bay
stallion.
The
line
parted
before
him.
On
a
golden
breastplate,
the
lion
of
Lannister
roared
its
defiance.
“Now,
if
truth
be
told,
I’m
not
sure
what
he
is.”

“Lannister,
this
is
madness,”
Littlefinger
said.
“Let
us
pass.
We
are
expected
back
at
the
castle.
What
do
you
think
you’re
doing?”

“He
knows
what
he’s
doing,”
Ned
said
calmly.

Jaime
Lannister
smiled.
“Quite
true.
I’m
looking
for
my
brother.
You
remember
my
brother,
don’t
you,
Lord
Stark?
He
was
with
us
at
Winterfell.
Fair-haired,
mismatched
eyes,
sharp
of
tongue.
A
short
man.”

“I
remember
him
well,”
Ned
replied.

“It
would
seem
he
has
met
some
trouble
on
the
road.
My
lord
father
is
quite
vexed.
You
would
not
perchance
have
any
notion
of
who
might
have
wished
my
brother
ill,
would
you?”

“Your
brother
has
been
taken
at
my
command,
to
answer
for
his
crimes,”
Ned
Stark
said.

Littlefinger
groaned
in
dismay.
“My
lords—”

Ser
Jaime
ripped
his
longsword
from
its
sheath
and
urged
his
stallion
forward.
“Show
me
your
steel,
Lord
Eddard.
I’ll
butcher
you
like
Aerys
if
I
must,
but
I’d
sooner
you
died
with
a
blade
in
your
hand.”
He
gave
Littlefinger
a
cool,
contemptuous
glance.
“Lord
Baelish,
I’d
leave
here
in
some
haste
if
I
did
not
care
to
get
bloodstains
on
my
costly
clothing.”

Littlefinger
did
not
need
to
be
urged.
“I
will
bring
the
City
Watch,”
he
promised
Ned.
The
Lannister
line
parted
to
let
him
through,
and
closed
behind
him.
Littlefinger
put
his
heels
to
his
mare
and
vanished
around
a
corner.

Ned’s
men
had
drawn
their
swords,
but
they
were
three
against
twenty.
Eyes
watched
from
nearby
windows
and
doors,
but
no
one
was
about
to
intervene.
His
party
was
mounted,
the
Lannisters
on
foot
save
for
Jaime
himself.
A
charge
might
win
them
free,
but
it
seemed
to
Eddard
Stark
that
they
had
a
surer,
safer
tactic.
“Kill
me,”
he
warned
the
Kingslayer,
“and
Catelyn
will
most
certainly
slay
Tyrion.”

Jaime
Lannister
poked
at
Ned’s
chest
with
the
gilded
sword
that
had
sipped
the
blood
of
the
last
of
the
Dragonkings.
“Would
she?
The
noble
Catelyn
Tully
of
Riverrun
murder
a
hostage?
I
think…
not.”
He
sighed.
“But
I
am
not
willing
to
chance
my
brother’s
life
on
a
woman’s
honor.”
Jaime
slid
the
golden
sword
into
its
sheath.
“So
I
suppose
I’ll
let
you
run
back
to
Robert
to
tell
him
how
I
frightened
you.
I
wonder
if
he’ll
care.”
Jaime
pushed
his
wet
hair
back
with
his
fingers
and
wheeled
his
horse
around.
When
he
was
beyond
the
line
of
swordsmen,
he
glanced
back
at
his
captain.
“Tregar,
see
that
no
harm
comes
to
Lord
Stark.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord.”

“Still…
we
wouldn’t
want
him
to
leave
here
entirely
unchastened,
so”—through
the
night
and
the
rain,
he
glimpsed
the
white
of
Jaime’s
smile—“kill
his
men.”

“No!”
Ned
Stark
screamed,
clawing
for
his
sword.
Jaime
was
already
cantering
off
down
the
street
as
he
heard
Wyl
shout.
Men
closed
from
both
sides.
Ned
rode
one
down,
cutting
at
phantoms
in
red
cloaks
who
gave
way
before
him.
Jory
Cassel
put
his
heels
into
his
mount
and
charged.
A
steel-shod
hoof
caught
a
Lannister
guardsman
in
the
face
with
a
sickening
crunch.
A
second
man
reeled
away
and
for
an
instant
Jory
was
free.
Wyl
cursed
as
they
pulled
him
off
his
dying
horse,
swords
slashing
in
the
rain.
Ned
galloped
to
him,
bringing
his
longsword
down
on
Tregar’s
helm.
The
jolt
of
impact
made
him
grit
his
teeth.
Tregar
stumbled
to
his
knees,
his
lion
crest
sheared
in
half,
blood
running
down
his
face.
Heward
was
hacking
at
the
hands
that
had
seized
his
bridle
when
a
spear
caught
him
in
the
belly.
Suddenly
Jory
was
back
among
them,
a
red
rain
flying
from
his
sword.
“No!”
Ned
shouted.
“Jory,
away!”
Ned’s
horse
slipped
under
him
and
came
crashing
down
in
the
mud.
There
was
a
moment
of
blinding
pain
and
the
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth.

He
saw
them
cut
the
legs
from
Jory’s
mount
and
drag
him
to
the
earth,
swords
rising
and
failing
as
they
closed
in
around
him.
When
Ned’s
horse
lurched
back
to
its
feet,
he
tried
to
rise,
only
to
fall
again,
choking
on
his
scream.
He
could
see
the
splintered
bone
poking
through
his
calf.
It
was
the
last
thing
he
saw
for
a
time.
The
rain
came
down
and
down
and
down.

When
he
opened
his
eyes
again,
Lord
Eddard
Stark
was
alone
with
his
dead.
His
horse
moved
closer,
caught
the
rank
scent
of
blood,
and
galloped
away.
Ned
began
to
drag
himself
through
the
mud,
gritting
his
teeth
at
the
agony
in
his
leg.
It
seemed
to
take
years.
Faces
watched
from
candlelit
windows,
and
people
began
to
emerge
from
alleys
and
doors,
but
no
one
moved
to
help.

Littlefinger
and
the
City
Watch
found
him
there
in
the
street,
cradling
Jory
Cassel’s
body
in
his
arms.

Somewhere
the
gold
cloaks
found
a
litter,
but
the
trip
back
to
the
castle
was
a
blur
of
agony,
and
Ned
lost
consciousness
more
than
once.
He
remembered
seeing
the
Red
Keep
looming
ahead
of
him
in
the
first
grey
light
of
dawn.
The
rain
had
darkened
the
pale
pink
stone
of
the
massive
walls
to
the
color
of
blood.

Then
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
looming
over
him,
holding
a
cup,
whispering,
“Drink,
my
lord.
Here.
The
milk
of
the
poppy,
for
your
pain.”
He
remembered
swallowing,
and
Pycelle
was
telling
someone
to
heat
the
wine
to
boiling
and
fetch
him
clean
silk,
and
that
was
the
last
he
knew.





DAENERYS

The
Horse
Gate
of
Vaes
Dothrak
was
made
of
two
gigantic
bronze
stallions,
rearing,
their
hooves
meeting
a
hundred
feet
above
the
roadway
to
form
a
pointed
arch.

Dany
could
not
have
said
why
the
city
needed
a
gate
when
it
had
no
walls…
and
no
buildings
that
she
could
see.
Yet
there
it
stood,
immense
and
beautiful,
the
great
horses
framing
the
distant
purple
mountain
beyond.
The
bronze
stallions
threw
long
shadows
across
the
waving
grasses
as
Khal
Drogo
led
the
khalasar
under
their
hooves
and
down
the
godsway,
his
bloodriders
beside
him.

Dany
followed
on
her
silver,
escorted
by
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
and
her
brother
Viserys,
mounted
once
more.
After
the
day
in
the
grass
when
she
had
left
him
to
walk
back
to
the
khalasar,
the
Dothraki
had
laughingly
called
him
Khal
Rhae
Mhar,
the
Sorefoot
King.
Khal
Drogo
had
offered
him
a
place
in
a
cart
the
next
day,
and
Viserys
had
accepted.
In
his
stubborn
ignorance,
he
had
not
even
known
he
was
being
mocked;
the
carts
were
for
eunuchs,
cripples,
women
giving
birth,
the
very
young
and
the
very
old.
That
won
him
yet
another
name:
Khal
Rhaggat,
the
Cart
King.
Her
brother
had
thought
it
was
the
khal’s
way
of
apologizing
for
the
wrong
Dany
had
done
him.
She
had
begged
Ser
Jorah
not
to
tell
him
the
truth,
lest
he
be
shamed.
The
knight
had
replied
that
the
king
could
well
do
with
a
bit
of
shame…
yet
he
had
done
as
she
bid.
It
had
taken
much
pleading,
and
all
the
pillow
tricks
Doreah
had
taught
her,
before
Dany
had
been
able
to
make
Drogo
relent
and
allow
Viserys
to
rejoin
them
at
the
head
of
the
column.

“Where
is
the
city?”
she
asked
as
they
passed
beneath
the
bronze
arch.
There
were
no
buildings
to
be
seen,
no
people,
only
the
grass
and
the
road,
lined
with
ancient
monuments
from
all
the
lands
the
Dothraki
had
sacked
over
the
centuries.

“Ahead,”
Ser
Jorah
answered.
“Under
the
mountain.”

Beyond
the
horse
gate,
plundered
gods
and
stolen
heroes
loomed
to
either
side
of
them.
The
forgotten
deities
of
dead
cities
brandished
their
broken
thunderbolts
at
the
sky
as
Dany
rode
her
silver
past
their
feet.
Stone
kings
looked
down
on
her
from
their
thrones,
their
faces
chipped
and
stained,
even
their
names
lost
in
the
mists
of
time.
Lithe
young
maidens
danced
on
marble
plinths,
draped
only
in
flowers,
or
poured
air
from
shattered
jars.
Monsters
stood
in
the
grass
beside
the
road;
black
iron
dragons
with
jewels
for
eyes,
roaring
griffins,
manticores
with
their
barbed
tails
poised
to
strike,
and
other
beasts
she
could
not
name.
Some
of
the
statues
were
so
lovely
they
took
her
breath
away,
others
so
misshapen
and
terrible
that
Dany
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
them.
Those,
Ser
Jorah
said,
had
likely
come
from
the
Shadow
Lands
beyond
Asshai.

“So
many,”
she
said
as
her
silver
stepped
slowly
onward,
“and
from
so
many
lands.”

Viserys
was
less
impressed.
“The
trash
of
dead
cities,”
he
sneered.
He
was
careful
to
speak
in
the
Common
Tongue,
which
few
Dothraki
could
understand,
yet
even
so
Dany
found
herself
glancing
back
at
the
men
of
her
khas,
to
make
certain
he
had
not
been
overheard.
He
went
on
blithely.
“All
these
savages
know
how
to
do
is
steal
the
things
better
men
have
built…
and
kill.”
He
laughed.
“They
do
know
how
to
kill.
Otherwise
I’d
have
no
use
for
them
at
all.”

“They
are
my
people
now,”
Dany
said.
“You
should
not
call
them
savages,
brother.”

“The
dragon
speaks
as
he
likes,”
Viserys
said…
in
the
Common
Tongue.
He
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
Aggo
and
Rakharo,
riding
behind
them,
and
favored
them
with
a
mocking
smile.
“See,
the
savages
lack
the
wit
to
understand
the
speech
of
civilized
men.”
A
moss-eaten
stone
monolith
loomed
over
the
road,
fifty
feet
tall.
Viserys
gazed
at
it
with
boredom
in
his
eyes.
“How
long
must
we
linger
amidst
these
ruins
before
Drogo
gives
me
my
army?
I
grow
tired
of
waiting.”

“The
princess
must
be
presented
to
the
dosh
khaleen…”

“The
crones,
yes,”
her
brother
interrupted,
“and
there’s
to
be
some
mummer’s
show
of
a
prophecy
for
the
whelp
in
her
belly,
you
told
me.
What
is
that
to
me?
I’m
tired
of
eating
horsemeat
and
I’m
sick
of
the
stink
of
these
savages.”
He
sniffed
at
the
wide,
floppy
sleeve
of
his
tunic,
where
it
was
his
custom
to
keep
a
sachet.
It
could
not
have
helped
much.
The
tunic
was
filthy.
All
the
silk
and
heavy
wools
that
Viserys
had
worn
out
of
Pentos
were
stained
by
hard
travel
and
rotted
from
sweat.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
said,
“The
Western
Market
will
have
food
more
to
your
taste,
Your
Grace.
The
traders
from
the
Free
Cities
come
there
to
sell
their
wares.
The
khal
will
honor
his
promise
in
his
own
time.”

“He
had
better,”
Viserys
said
grimly.
“I
was
promised
a
crown,
and
I
mean
to
have
it.
The
dragon
is
not
mocked.”
Spying
an
obscene
likeness
of
a
woman
with
six
breasts
and
a
ferret’s
head,
he
rode
off
to
inspect
it
more
closely.

Dany
was
relieved,
yet
no
less
anxious.
“I
pray
that
my
sun-and-stars
will
not
keep
him
waiting
too
long,”
she
told
Ser
Jorah
when
her
brother
was
out
of
earshot.

The
knight
looked
after
Viserys
doubtfully.
“Your
brother
should
have
bided
his
time
in
Pentos.
There
is
no
place
for
him
in
a
khalasar.
Illyrio
tried
to
warn
him.”

“He
will
go
as
soon
as
he
has
his
ten
thousand.
My
lord
husband
promised
a
golden
crown.”

Ser
Jorah
grunted.
“Yes,
Khaleesi,
but…
the
Dothraki
look
on
these
things
differently
than
we
do
in
the
west.
I
have
told
him
as
much,
as
Illyrio
told
him,
but
your
brother
does
not
listen.
The
horselords
are
no
traders.
Viserys
thinks
he
sold
you,
and
now
he
wants
his
price.
Yet
Khal
Drogo
would
say
he
had
you
as
a
gift.
He
will
give
Viserys
a
gift
in
return,
yes…
in
his
own
time.
You
do
not
demand
a
gift,
not
of
a
khal.
You
do
not
demand
anything
of
a
khal.”

“It
is
not
right
to
make
him
wait.”
Dany
did
not
know
why
she
was
defending
her
brother,
yet
she
was.
“Viserys
says
he
could
sweep
the
Seven
Kingdoms
with
ten
thousand
Dothraki
screamers.”

Ser
Jorah
snorted.
“Viserys
could
not
sweep
a
stable
with
ten
thousand
brooms.”

Dany
could
not
pretend
to
surprise
at
the
disdain
in
his
tone.
“What…
what
if
it
were
not
Viserys?”
she
asked.
“If
it
were
someone
else
who
led
them?
Someone
stronger?
Could
the
Dothraki
truly
conquer
the
Seven
Kingdoms?”

Ser
Jorah’s
face
grew
thoughtful
as
their
horses
trod
together
down
the
godsway.
“When
I
first
went
into
exile,
I
looked
at
the
Dothraki
and
saw
half-naked
barbarians,
as
wild
as
their
horses.
If
you
had
asked
me
then,
Princess,
I
should
have
told
you
that
a
thousand
good
knights
would
have
no
trouble
putting
to
flight
a
hundred
times
as
many
Dothraki.”

“But
if
I
asked
you
now?”

“Now,”
the
knight
said,
“I
am
less
certain.
They
are
better
riders
than
any
knight,
utterly
fearless,
and
their
bows
outrange
ours.
In
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
most
archers
fight
on
foot,
from
behind
a
shieldwall
or
a
barricade
of
sharpened
stakes.
The
Dothraki
fire
from
horseback,
charging
or
retreating,
it
makes
no
matter,
they
are
full
as
deadly…
and
there
are
so
many
of
them,
my
lady.
Your
lord
husband
alone
counts
forty
thousand
mounted
warriors
in
his
khalasar.”

“Is
that
truly
so
many?”

“Your
brother
Rhaegar
brought
as
many
men
to
the
Trident,”
Ser
Jorah
admitted,
“but
of
that
number,
no
more
than
a
tenth
were
knights.
The
rest
were
archers,
freeriders,
and
foot
soldiers
armed
with
spears
and
pikes.
When
Rhaegar
fell,
many
threw
down
their
weapons
and
fled
the
field.
How
long
do
you
imagine
such
a
rabble
would
stand
against
the
charge
of
forty
thousand
screamers
howling
for
blood?
How
well
would
boiled
leather
jerkins
and
mailed
shirts
protect
them
when
the
arrows
fall
like
rain?”

“Not
long,”
she
said,
“not
well.”

He
nodded.
“Mind
you,
Princess,
if
the
lords
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
have
the
wit
the
gods
gave
a
goose,
it
will
never
come
to
that.
The
riders
have
no
taste
for
siegecraft.
I
doubt
they
could
take
even
the
weakest
castle
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
if
Robert
Baratheon
were
fool
enough
to
give
them
battle…”

“Is
he?”
Dany
asked.
“A
fool,
I
mean?”

Ser
Jorah
considered
that
for
a
moment.
“Robert
should
have
been
born
Dothraki,”
he
said
at
last.
“Your
khal
would
tell
you
that
only
a
coward
hides
behind
stone
walls
instead
of
facing
his
enemy
with
a
blade
in
hand.
The
Usurper
would
agree.
He
is
a
strong
man,
brave…
and
rash
enough
to
meet
a
Dothraki
horde
in
the
open
field.
But
the
men
around
him,
well,
their
pipers
play
a
different
tune.
His
brother
Stannis,
Lord
Tywin
Lannister,
Eddard
Stark…”
He
spat.

“You
hate
this
Lord
Stark,”
Dany
said.

“He
took
from
me
all
I
loved,
for
the
sake
of
a
few
lice-ridden
poachers
and
his
precious
honor,”
Ser
Jorah
said
bitterly.
From
his
tone,
she
could
tell
the
loss
still
pained
him.
He
changed
the
subject
quickly.
“There,”
he
announced,
pointing.
“Vaes
Dothrak.
The
city
of
the
horselords.”

Khal
Drogo
and
his
bloodriders
led
them
through
the
great
bazaar
of
the
Western
Market,
down
the
broad
ways
beyond.
Dany
followed
close
on
her
silver,
staring
at
the
strangeness
about
her.
Vaes
Dothrak
was
at
once
the
largest
city
and
the
smallest
that
she
had
ever
known.
She
thought
it
must
be
ten
times
as
large
as
Pentos,
a
vastness
without
walls
or
limits,
its
broad
windswept
streets
paved
in
grass
and
mud
and
carpeted
with
wildflowers.
In
the
Free
Cities
of
the
west,
towers
and
manses
and
hovels
and
bridges
and
shops
and
halls
all
crowded
in
on
one
another,
but
Vaes
Dothrak
sprawled
languorously,
baking
in
the
warm
sun,
ancient,
arrogant,
and
empty.

Even
the
buildings
were
so
queer
to
her
eyes.
She
saw
carved
stone
pavilions,
manses
of
woven
grass
as
large
as
castles,
rickety
wooden
towers,
stepped
pyramids
faced
with
marble,
log
halls
open
to
the
sky.
In
place
of
walls,
some
palaces
were
surrounded
by
thorny
hedges.
“None
of
them
are
alike,”
she
said.

“Your
brother
had
part
of
the
truth,”
Ser
Jorah
admitted.
“The
Dothraki
do
not
build.
A
thousand
years
ago,
to
make
a
house,
they
would
dig
a
hole
in
the
earth
and
cover
it
with
a
woven
grass
roof.
The
buildings
you
see
were
made
by
slaves
brought
here
from
lands
they’ve
plundered,
and
they
built
each
after
the
fashion
of
their
own
peoples.”

Most
of
the
halls,
even
the
largest,
seemed
deserted.
“Where
are
the
people
who
live
here?”
Dany
asked.
The
bazaar
had
been
full
of
running
children
and
men
shouting,
but
elsewhere
she
had
seen
only
a
few
eunuchs
going
about
their
business.

“Only
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
dwell
permanently
in
the
sacred
city,
them
and
their
slaves
and
servants,”
Ser
Jorah
replied,
“yet
Vaes
Dothrak
is
large
enough
to
house
every
man
of
every
khalasar,
should
all
the
khals
return
to
the
Mother
at
once.
The
crones
have
prophesied
that
one
day
that
will
come
to
pass,
and
so
Vaes
Dothrak
must
be
ready
to
embrace
all
its
children.”

Khal
Drogo
finally
called
a
halt
near
the
Eastern
Market
where
the
caravans
from
Yi
Ti
and
Asshai
and
the
Shadow
Lands
came
to
trade,
with
the
Mother
of
Mountains
looming
overhead.
Dany
smiled
as
she
recalled
Magister
Illyrio’s
slave
girl
and
her
talk
of
a
palace
with
two
hundred
rooms
and
doors
of
solid
silver.
The
“palace”
was
a
cavernous
wooden
feasting
hall,
its
rough-hewn
timbered
walls
rising
forty
feet,
its
roof
sewn
silk,
a
vast
billowing
tent
that
could
be
raised
to
keep
out
the
rare
rains,
or
lowered
to
admit
the
endless
sky.
Around
the
hall
were
broad
grassy
horse
yards
fenced
with
high
hedges,
firepits,
and
hundreds
of
round
earthen
houses
that
bulged
from
the
ground
like
miniature
hills,
covered
with
grass.

A
small
army
of
slaves
had
gone
ahead
to
prepare
for
Khal
Drogo’s
arrival.
As
each
rider
swung
down
from
his
saddle,
he
unbelted
his
arakh
and
handed
it
to
a
waiting
slave,
and
any
other
weapons
he
carried
as
well.
Even
Khal
Drogo
himself
was
not
exempt.
Ser
Jorah
had
explained
that
it
was
forbidden
to
carry
a
blade
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
or
to
shed
a
free
man’s
blood.
Even
warring
khalasars
put
aside
their
feuds
and
shared
meat
and
mead
together
when
they
were
in
sight
of
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
In
this
place,
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
had
decreed,
all
Dothraki
were
one
blood,
one
khalasar,
one
herd.

Cohollo
came
to
Dany
as
Irri
and
Jhiqui
were
helping
her
down
off
her
silver.
He
was
the
oldest
of
Drogo’s
three
bloodriders,
a
squat
bald
man
with
a
crooked
nose
and
a
mouth
full
of
broken
teeth,
shattered
by
a
mace
twenty
years
before
when
he
saved
the
young
khalakka
from
sellswords
who
hoped
to
sell
him
to
his
father’s
enemies.
His
life
had
been
bound
to
Drogo’s
the
day
her
lord
husband
was
born.

Every
khal
had
his
bloodriders.
At
first
Dany
had
thought
of
them
as
a
kind
of
Dothraki
Kingsguard,
sworn
to
protect
their
lord,
but
it
went
further
than
that.
Jhiqui
had
taught
her
that
a
bloodrider
was
more
than
a
guard;
they
were
the
khal’s
brothers,
his
shadows,
his
fiercest
friends.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Drogo
called
them,
and
so
it
was;
they
shared
a
single
life.
The
ancient
traditions
of
the
horselords
demanded
that
when
the
khal
died,
his
bloodriders
died
with
him,
to
ride
at
his
side
in
the
night
lands.
If
the
khal
died
at
the
hands
of
some
enemy,
they
lived
only
long
enough
to
avenge
him,
and
then
followed
him
joyfully
into
the
grave.
In
some
khalasars,
Jhiqui
said,
the
bloodriders
shared
the
khal’s
wine,
his
tent,
and
even
his
wives,
though
never
his
horses.
A
man’s
mount
was
his
own.

Daenerys
was
glad
that
Khal
Drogo
did
not
hold
to
those
ancient
ways.
She
should
not
have
liked
being
shared.
And
while
old
Cohollo
treated
her
kindly
enough,
the
others
frightened
her;
Haggo,
huge
and
silent,
often
glowered
as
if
he
had
forgotten
who
she
was,
and
Qotho
had
cruel
eyes
and
quick
hands
that
liked
to
hurt.
He
left
bruises
on
Doreah’s
soft
white
skin
whenever
he
touched
her,
and
sometimes
made
Irri
sob
in
the
night.
Even
his
horses
seemed
to
fear
him.

Yet
they
were
bound
to
Drogo
for
life
and
death,
so
Daenerys
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
them.
And
sometimes
she
found
herself
wishing
her
father
had
been
protected
by
such
men.
In
the
songs,
the
white
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
were
ever
noble,
valiant,
and
true,
and
yet
King
Aerys
had
been
murdered
by
one
of
them,
the
handsome
boy
they
now
called
the
Kingslayer,
and
a
second,
Ser
Barristan
the
Bold,
had
gone
over
to
the
Usurper.
She
wondered
if
all
men
were
as
false
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
When
her
son
sat
the
Iron
Throne,
she
would
see
that
he
had
bloodriders
of
his
own
to
protect
him
against
treachery
in
his
Kingsguard.

“Khaleesi,”
Cohollo
said
to
her,
in
Dothraki.
“Drogo,
who
is
blood
of
my
blood,
commands
me
to
tell
you
that
he
must
ascend
the
Mother
of
Mountains
this
night,
to
sacrifice
to
the
gods
for
his
safe
return.”

Only
men
were
allowed
to
set
foot
on
the
Mother,
Dany
knew.
The
khal’s
bloodriders
would
go
with
him,
and
return
at
dawn.
“Tell
my
sun-and-stars
that
I
dream
of
him,
and
wait
anxious
for
his
return,”
she
replied,
thankful.
Dany
tired
more
easily
as
the
child
grew
within
her;
in
truth,
a
night
of
rest
would
be
most
welcome.
Her
pregnancy
only
seemed
to
have
inflamed
Drogo’s
desire
for
her,
and
of
late
his
embraces
left
her
exhausted.

Doreah
led
her
to
the
hollow
hill
that
had
been
prepared
for
her
and
her
khal.
It
was
cool
and
dim
within,
like
a
tent
made
of
earth.
“Jhiqui,
a
bath,
please,”
she
commanded,
to
wash
the
dust
of
travel
from
her
skin
and
soak
her
weary
bones.
It
was
pleasant
to
know
that
they
would
linger
here
for
a
while,
that
she
would
not
need
to
climb
back
on
her
silver
on
the
morrow.

The
water
was
scalding
hot,
as
she
liked
it.
“I
will
give
my
brother
his
gifts
tonight,”
she
decided
as
Jhiqui
was
washing
her
hair.
“He
should
look
a
king
in
the
sacred
city.
Doreah,
run
and
find
him
and
invite
him
to
sup
with
me.”
Viserys
was
nicer
to
the
Lysene
girl
than
to
her
Dothraki
handmaids,
perhaps
because
Magister
Illyrio
had
let
him
bed
her
back
in
Pentos.
“Irri,
go
to
the
bazaar
and
buy
fruit
and
meat.
Anything
but
horseflesh.”

“Horse
is
best,”
Irri
said.
“Horse
makes
a
man
strong.”

“Viserys
hates
horsemeat.”

“As
you
say,
Khaleesi.”

She
brought
back
a
haunch
of
goat
and
a
basket
of
fruits
and
vegetables.
Jhiqui
roasted
the
meat
with
sweetgrass
and
firepods,
basting
it
with
honey
as
it
cooked,
and
there
were
melons
and
pomegranates
and
plums
and
some
queer
eastern
fruit
Dany
did
not
know.
While
her
handmaids
prepared
the
meal,
Dany
laid
out
the
clothing
she’d
had
made
to
her
brother’s
measure:
a
tunic
and
leggings
of
crisp
white
linen,
leather
sandals
that
laced
up
to
the
knee,
a
bronze
medallion
belt,
a
leather
vest
painted
with
fire-breathing
dragons.
The
Dothraki
would
respect
him
more
if
he
looked
less
a
beggar,
she
hoped,
and
perhaps
he
would
forgive
her
for
shaming
him
that
day
in
the
grass.
He
was
still
her
king,
after
all,
and
her
brother.
They
were
both
blood
of
the
dragon.

She
was
arranging
the
last
of
his
gifts—a
sandsilk
cloak,
green
as
grass,
with
a
pale
grey
border
that
would
bring
out
the
silver
in
his
hair—when
Viserys
arrived,
dragging
Doreah
by
the
arm.
Her
eye
was
red
where
he’d
hit
her.
“How
dare
you
send
this
whore
to
give
me
commands,”
he
said.
He
shoved
the
handmaid
roughly
to
the
carpet.

The
anger
took
Dany
utterly
by
surprise.
“I
only
wanted…
Doreah,
what
did
you
say?”

“Khaleesi,
pardons,
forgive
me.
I
went
to
him,
as
you
bid,
and
told
him
you
commanded
him
to
join
you
for
supper.”

“No
one
commands
the
dragon,”
Viserys
snarled.
“I
am
your
king!
I
should
have
sent
you
back
her
head!”

The
Lysene
girl
quailed,
but
Dany
calmed
her
with
a
touch.
“Don’t
be
afraid,
he
won’t
hurt
you.
Sweet
brother,
please,
forgive
her,
the
girl
misspoke
herself,
I
told
her
to
ask
you
to
sup
with
me,
if
it
pleases
Your
Grace.”
She
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
across
the
room.
“Look.
These
are
for
you.”

Viserys
frowned
suspiciously.
“What
is
all
this?”

“New
raiment.
I
had
it
made
for
you.”
Dany
smiled
shyly.

He
looked
at
her
and
sneered.
“Dothraki
rags.
Do
you
presume
to
dress
me
now?”

“Please…
you’ll
be
cooler
and
more
comfortable,
and
I
thought…
maybe
if
you
dressed
like
them,
the
Dothraki…”
Dany
did
not
know
how
to
say
it
without
waking
his
dragon.

“Next
you’ll
want
to
braid
my
hair.”

“I’d
never…”
Why
was
he
always
so
cruel?
She
had
only
wanted
to
help.
“You
have
no
right
to
a
braid,
you
have
won
no
victories
yet.”

It
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say.
Fury
shone
from
his
lilac
eyes,
yet
he
dared
not
strike
her,
not
with
her
handmaids
watching
and
the
warriors
of
her
khas
outside.
Viserys
picked
up
the
cloak
and
sniffed
at
it.
“This
stinks
of
manure.
Perhaps
I
shall
use
it
as
a
horse
blanket.”

“I
had
Doreah
sew
it
specially
for
you,”
she
told
him,
wounded.
“These
are
garments
fit
for
a
khal.”

“I
am
the
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
not
some
grass-stained
savage
with
bells
in
his
hair,”
Viserys
spat
back
at
her.
He
grabbed
her
arm.
“You
forget
yourself,
slut.
Do
you
think
that
big
belly
will
protect
you
if
you
wake
the
dragon?”

His
fingers
dug
into
her
arm
painfully
and
for
an
instant
Dany
felt
like
a
child
again,
quailing
in
the
face
of
his
rage.
She
reached
out
with
her
other
hand
and
grabbed
the
first
thing
she
touched,
the
belt
she’d
hoped
to
give
him,
a
heavy
chain
of
ornate
bronze
medallions.
She
swung
it
with
all
her
strength.

It
caught
him
full
in
the
face.
Viserys
let
go
of
her.
Blood
ran
down
his
cheek
where
the
edge
of
one
of
the
medallions
had
sliced
it
open.
“You
are
the
one
who
forgets
himself,”
Dany
said
to
him.
“Didn’t
you
learn
anything
that
day
in
the
grass?
Leave
me
now,
before
I
summon
my
khas
to
drag
you
out.
And
pray
that
Khal
Drogo
does
not
hear
of
this,
or
he
will
cut
open
your
belly
and
feed
you
your
own
entrails.”

Viserys
scrambled
back
to
his
feet.
“When
I
come
into
my
kingdom,
you
will
rue
this
day,
slut.”
He
walked
off,
holding
his
torn
face,
leaving
her
gifts
behind
him.

Drops
of
his
blood
had
spattered
the
beautiful
sandsilk
cloak.
Dany
clutched
the
soft
cloth
to
her
cheek
and
sat
cross-legged
on
her
sleeping
mats.

“Your
supper
is
ready,
Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
announced.

“I’m
not
hungry,”
Dany
said
sadly.
She
was
suddenly
very
tired.
“Share
the
food
among
yourselves,
and
send
some
to
Ser
Jorah,
if
you
would.”
After
a
moment
she
added,
“Please,
bring
me
one
of
the
dragon’s
eggs.”

Irri
fetched
the
egg
with
the
deep
green
shell,
bronze
flecks
shining
amid
its
scales
as
she
turned
it
in
her
small
hands.
Dany
curled
up
on
her
side,
pulling
the
sandsilk
cloak
across
her
and
cradling
the
egg
in
the
hollow
between
her
swollen
belly
and
small,
tender
breasts.
She
liked
to
hold
them.
They
were
so
beautiful,
and
sometimes
just
being
close
to
them
made
her
feel
stronger,
braver,
as
if
somehow
she
were
drawing
strength
from
the
stone
dragons
locked
inside.

She
was
lying
there,
holding
the
egg,
when
she
felt
the
child
move
within
her…
as
if
he
were
reaching
out,
brother
to
brother,
blood
to
blood.
“You
are
the
dragon,”
Dany
whispered
to
him,
“the
true
dragon.
I
know
it.
I
know
it.”
And
she
smiled,
and
went
to
sleep
dreaming
of
home.





BRAN

A
light
snow
was
falling.
Bran
could
feel
the
flakes
on
his
face,
melting
as
they
touched
his
skin
like
the
gentlest
of
rains.
He
sat
straight
atop
his
horse,
watching
as
the
iron
portcullis
was
winched
upward.
Try
as
he
might
to
keep
calm,
his
heart
was
fluttering
in
his
chest.

“Are
you
ready?”
Robb
asked.

Bran
nodded,
trying
not
to
let
his
fear
show.
He
had
not
been
outside
Winterfell
since
his
fall,
but
he
was
determined
to
ride
out
as
proud
as
any
knight.

“Let’s
ride,
then.”
Robb
put
his
heels
into
his
big
grey-and-white
gelding,
and
the
horse
walked
under
the
portcullis.

“Go,”
Bran
whispered
to
his
own
horse.
He
touched
her
neck
lightly,
and
the
small
chestnut
filly
started
forward.
Bran
had
named
her
Dancer.
She
was
two
years
old,
and
Joseth
said
she
was
smarter
than
any
horse
had
a
right
to
be.
They
had
trained
her
special,
to
respond
to
rein
and
voice
and
touch.
Up
to
now,
Bran
had
only
ridden
her
around
the
yard.
At
first
Joseth
or
Hodor
would
lead
her,
while
Bran
sat
strapped
to
her
back
in
the
oversize
saddle
the
Imp
had
drawn
up
for
him,
but
for
the
past
fortnight
he
had
been
riding
her
on
his
own,
trotting
her
round
and
round,
and
growing
bolder
with
every
circuit.

They
passed
beneath
the
gatehouse,
over
the
drawbridge,
through
the
outer
walls.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
came
loping
beside
them,
sniffing
at
the
wind.
Close
behind
came
Theon
Greyjoy,
with
his
longbow
and
a
quiver
of
broadheads;
he
had
a
mind
to
take
a
deer,
he
had
told
them.
He
was
followed
by
four
guardsmen
in
mailed
shirts
and
coifs,
and
Joseth,
a
stick-thin
stableman
whom
Robb
had
named
master
of
horse
while
Hullen
was
away.
Maester
Luwin
brought
up
the
rear,
riding
on
a
donkey.
Bran
would
have
liked
it
better
if
he
and
Robb
had
gone
off
alone,
just
the
two
of
them,
but
Hal
Mollen
would
not
hear
of
it,
and
Maester
Luwin
backed
him.
If
Bran
fell
off
his
horse
or
injured
himself,
the
maester
was
determined
to
be
with
him.

Beyond
the
castle
lay
the
market
square,
its
wooden
stalls
deserted
now.
They
rode
down
the
muddy
streets
of
the
village,
past
rows
of
small
neat
houses
of
log
and
undressed
stone.
Less
than
one
in
five
were
occupied,
thin
tendrils
of
woodsmoke
curling
up
from
their
chimneys.
The
rest
would
fill
up
one
by
one
as
it
grew
colder.
When
the
snow
fell
and
the
ice
winds
howled
down
out
of
the
north,
Old
Nan
said,
farmers
left
their
frozen
fields
and
distant
holdfasts,
loaded
up
their
wagons,
and
then
the
winter
town
came
alive.
Bran
had
never
seen
it
happen,
but
Maester
Luwin
said
the
day
was
looming
closer.
The
end
of
the
long
summer
was
near
at
hand.
Winter
is
coming.

A
few
villagers
eyed
the
direwolves
anxiously
as
the
riders
went
past,
and
one
man
dropped
the
wood
he
was
carrying
as
he
shrank
away
in
fear,
but
most
of
the
townfolk
had
grown
used
to
the
sight.
They
bent
the
knee
when
they
saw
the
boys,
and
Robb
greeted
each
of
them
with
a
lordly
nod.

With
his
legs
unable
to
grip,
the
swaying
motion
of
the
horse
made
Bran
feel
unsteady
at
first,
but
the
huge
saddle
with
its
thick
horn
and
high
back
cradled
him
comfortingly,
and
the
straps
around
his
chest
and
thighs
would
not
allow
him
to
fall.
After
a
time
the
rhythm
began
to
feel
almost
natural.
His
anxiety
faded,
and
a
tremulous
smile
crept
across
his
face.

Two
serving
wenches
stood
beneath
the
sign
of
the
Smoking
Log,
the
local
alehouse.
When
Theon
Greyjoy
called
out
to
them,
the
younger
girl
turned
red
and
covered
her
face.
Theon
spurred
his
mount
to
move
up
beside
Robb.
“Sweet
Kyra,”
he
said
with
a
laugh.
“She
squirms
like
a
weasel
in
bed,
but
say
a
word
to
her
on
the
street,
and
she
blushes
pink
as
a
maid.
Did
I
ever
tell
you
about
the
night
that
she
and
Bessa—”

“Not
where
my
brother
can
hear,
Theon,”
Robb
warned
him
with
a
glance
at
Bran.

Bran
looked
away
and
pretended
not
to
have
heard,
but
he
could
feel
Greyjoy’s
eyes
on
him.
No
doubt
he
was
smiling.
He
smiled
a
lot,
as
if
the
world
were
a
secret
joke
that
only
he
was
clever
enough
to
understand.
Robb
seemed
to
admire
Theon
and
enjoy
his
company,
but
Bran
had
never
warmed
to
his
father’s
ward.

Robb
rode
closer.
“You
are
doing
well,
Bran.”

“I
want
to
go
faster,”
Bran
replied.

Robb
smiled.
“As
you
will.”
He
sent
his
gelding
into
a
trot.
The
wolves
raced
after
him.
Bran
snapped
the
reins
sharply,
and
Dancer
picked
up
her
pace.
He
heard
a
shout
from
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
the
hoofbeats
of
the
other
horses
behind
him.

Bran’s
cloak
billowed
out,
rippling
in
the
wind,
and
the
snow
seemed
to
rush
at
his
face.
Robb
was
well
ahead,
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
Bran
and
the
others
were
following.
He
snapped
the
reins
again.
Smooth
as
silk,
Dancer
slid
into
a
gallop.
The
distance
closed.
By
the
time
he
caught
Robb
on
the
edge
of
the
wolfswood,
two
miles
beyond
the
winter
town,
they
had
left
the
others
well
behind.
“I
can
ride!”
Bran
shouted,
grinning.
It
felt
almost
as
good
as
flying.

“I’d
race
you,
but
I
fear
you’d
win.”
Robb’s
tone
was
light
and
joking,
yet
Bran
could
tell
that
something
was
troubling
his
brother
underneath
the
smile.

“I
don’t
want
to
race.”
Bran
looked
around
for
the
direwolves.
Both
had
vanished
into
the
wood.
“Did
you
hear
Summer
howling
last
night?”

“Grey
Wind
was
restless
too,”
Robb
said.
His
auburn
hair
had
grown
shaggy
and
unkempt,
and
a
reddish
stubble
covered
his
jaw,
making
him
look
older
than
his
fifteen
years.
“Sometimes
I
think
they
know
things…
sense
things…”
Robb
sighed.
“I
never
know
how
much
to
tell
you,
Bran.
I
wish
you
were
older.”

“I’m
eight
now!”
Bran
said.
“Eight
isn’t
so
much
younger
than
fifteen,
and
I’m
the
heir
to
Winterfell,
after
you.”

“So
you
are.”
Robb
sounded
sad,
and
even
a
little
scared.
“Bran,
I
need
to
tell
you
something.
There
was
a
bird
last
night.
From
King’s
Landing.
Maester
Luwin
woke
me.”

Bran
felt
a
sudden
dread.
Dark
wings,
dark
words,
Old
Nan
always
said,
and
of
late
the
messenger
ravens
had
been
proving
the
truth
of
the
proverb.
When
Robb
wrote
to
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
the
bird
that
came
back
brought
word
that
Uncle
Benjen
was
still
missing.
Then
a
message
had
arrived
from
the
Eyrie,
from
Mother,
but
that
had
not
been
good
news
either.
She
did
not
say
when
she
meant
to
return,
only
that
she
had
taken
the
Imp
as
prisoner.
Bran
had
sort
of
liked
the
little
man,
yet
the
name
Lannister
sent
cold
fingers
creeping
up
his
spine.
There
was
something
about
the
Lannisters,
something
he
ought
to
remember,
but
when
he
tried
to
think
what,
he
felt
dizzy
and
his
stomach
clenched
hard
as
a
stone.
Robb
spent
most
of
that
day
locked
behind
closed
doors
with
Maester
Luwin,
Theon
Greyjoy,
and
Hallis
Mollen.
Afterward,
riders
were
sent
out
on
fast
horses,
carrying
Robb’s
commands
throughout
the
north.
Bran
heard
talk
of
Moat
Cailin,
the
ancient
stronghold
the
First
Men
had
built
at
the
top
of
the
Neck.
No
one
ever
told
him
what
was
happening,
yet
he
knew
it
was
not
good.

And
now
another
raven,
another
message.
Bran
clung
to
hope.
“Was
the
bird
from
Mother?
Is
she
coming
home?”

“The
message
was
from
Alyn
in
King’s
Landing.
Jory
Cassel
is
dead.
And
Wyl
and
Heward
as
well.
Murdered
by
the
Kingslayer.”
Robb
lifted
his
face
to
the
snow,
and
the
flakes
melted
on
his
cheeks.
“May
the
gods
give
them
rest.”

Bran
did
not
know
what
to
say.
He
felt
as
if
he’d
been
punched.
Jory
had
been
captain
of
the
household
guard
at
Winterfell
since
before
Bran
was
born.
“They
killed
Jory?”
He
remembered
all
the
times
Jory
had
chased
him
over
the
roofs.
He
could
picture
him
striding
across
the
yard
in
mail
and
plate,
or
sitting
at
his
accustomed
place
on
the
bench
in
the
Great
Hall,
joking
as
he
ate.
“Why
would
anyone
kill
Jory?”

Robb
shook
his
head
numbly,
the
pain
plain
in
his
eyes.
“I
don’t
know,
and…
Bran,
that’s
not
the
worst
of
it.
Father
was
caught
beneath
a
falling
horse
in
the
fight.
Alyn
says
his
leg
was
shattered,
and…
Maester
Pycelle
has
given
him
the
milk
of
the
poppy,
but
they
aren’t
sure
when…
when
he…”
The
sound
of
hoofbeats
made
him
glance
down
the
road,
to
where
Theon
and
the
others
were
coming
up.
“When
he
will
wake,”
Robb
finished.
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword
then,
and
went
on
in
the
solemn
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord.
“Bran,
I
promise
you,
whatever
might
happen,
I
will
not
let
this
be
forgotten.”

Something
in
his
tone
made
Bran
even
more
fearful.
“What
will
you
do?”
he
asked
as
Theon
Greyjoy
reined
in
beside
them.

“Theon
thinks
I
should
call
the
banners,”
Robb
said.

“Blood
for
blood.”
For
once
Greyjoy
did
not
smile.
His
lean,
dark
face
had
a
hungry
look
to
it,
and
black
hair
fell
down
across
his
eyes.

“Only
the
lord
can
call
the
banners,”
Bran
said
as
the
snow
drifted
down
around
them.

“If
your
father
dies,”
Theon
said,
“Robb
will
be
Lord
of
Winterfell.”

“He
won’t
die!”
Bran
screamed
at
him.

Robb
took
his
hand.
“He
won’t
die,
not
Father,”
he
said
calmly.
“Still…
the
honor
of
the
north
is
in
my
hands
now.
When
our
lord
father
took
his
leave
of
us,
he
told
me
to
be
strong
for
you
and
for
Rickon.
I’m
almost
a
man
grown,
Bran.”

Bran
shivered.
“I
wish
Mother
was
back,”
he
said
miserably.
He
looked
around
for
Maester
Luwin;
his
donkey
was
visible
in
the
far
distance,
trotting
over
a
rise.
“Does
Maester
Luwin
say
to
call
the
banners
too?”

“The
maester
is
timid
as
an
old
woman,”
said
Theon.

“Father
always
listened
to
his
counsel,”
Bran
reminded
his
brother.
“Mother
too.”

“I
listen
to
him,”
Robb
insisted.
“I
listen
to
everyone.”

The
joy
Bran
had
felt
at
the
ride
was
gone,
melted
away
like
the
snowflakes
on
his
face.
Not
so
long
ago,
the
thought
of
Robb
calling
the
banners
and
riding
off
to
war
would
have
filled
him
with
excitement,
but
now
he
felt
only
dread.
“Can
we
go
back
now?”
he
asked.
“I’m
cold.”

Robb
glanced
around.
“We
need
to
find
the
wolves.
Can
you
stand
to
go
a
bit
longer?”

“I
can
go
as
long
as
you
can.”
Maester
Luwin
had
warned
him
to
keep
the
ride
short,
for
fear
of
saddle
sores,
but
Bran
would
not
admit
to
weakness
in
front
of
his
brother.
He
was
sick
of
the
way
everyone
was
always
fussing
over
him
and
asking
how
he
was.

“Let’s
hunt
down
the
hunters,
then,”
Robb
said.
Side
by
side,
they
urged
their
mounts
off
the
kingsroad
and
struck
out
into
the
wolfswood.
Theon
dropped
back
and
followed
well
behind
them,
talking
and
joking
with
the
guardsmen.

It
was
nice
under
the
trees.
Bran
kept
Dancer
to
a
walk,
holding
the
reins
lightly
and
looking
all
around
him
as
they
went.
He
knew
this
wood,
but
he
had
been
so
long
confined
to
Winterfell
that
he
felt
as
though
he
were
seeing
it
for
the
first
time.
The
smells
filled
his
nostrils;
the
sharp
fresh
tang
of
pine
needles,
the
earthy
odor
of
wet
rotting
leaves,
the
hints
of
animal
musk
and
distant
cooking
fires.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
squirrel
moving
through
the
snow-covered
branches
of
an
oak,
and
paused
to
study
the
silvery
web
of
an
empress
spider.

Theon
and
the
others
fell
farther
and
farther
behind,
until
Bran
could
no
longer
hear
their
voices.
From
ahead
came
the
faint
sound
of
rushing
waters.
It
grew
louder
until
they
reached
the
stream.
Tears
stung
his
eyes.

“Bran?”
Robb
asked.
“What’s
wrong?”

Bran
shook
his
head.
“I
was
just
remembering,”
he
said.
“Jory
brought
us
here
once,
to
fish
for
trout.
You
and
me
and
Jon.
Do
you
remember?”

“I
remember,”
Robb
said,
his
voice
quiet
and
sad.

“I
didn’t
catch
anything,”
Bran
said,
“but
Jon
gave
me
his
fish
on
the
way
back
to
Winterfell.
Will
we
ever
see
Jon
again?”

“We
saw
Uncle
Benjen
when
the
king
came
to
visit,”
Robb
pointed
out.
“Jon
will
visit
too,
you’ll
see.”

The
stream
was
running
high
and
fast.
Robb
dismounted
and
led
his
gelding
across
the
ford.
In
the
deepest
part
of
the
crossing,
the
water
came
up
to
midthigh.
He
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
on
the
far
side,
and
waded
back
across
for
Bran
and
Dancer.
The
current
foamed
around
rock
and
root,
and
Bran
could
feel
the
spray
on
his
face
as
Robb
led
him
over.
It
made
him
smile.
For
a
moment
he
felt
strong
again,
and
whole.
He
looked
up
at
the
trees
and
dreamed
of
climbing
them,
right
up
to
the
very
top,
with
the
whole
forest
spread
out
beneath
him.

They
were
on
the
far
side
when
they
heard
the
howl,
a
long
rising
wail
that
moved
through
the
trees
like
a
cold
wind.
Bran
raised
his
head
to
listen.
“Summer,”
he
said.
No
sooner
had
he
spoken
than
a
second
voice
joined
the
first.

“They’ve
made
a
kill,”
Robb
said
as
he
remounted.
“I’d
best
go
and
bring
them
back.
Wait
here,
Theon
and
the
others
should
be
along
shortly.”

“I
want
to
go
with
you,”
Bran
said.

“I’ll
find
them
faster
by
myself.”
Robb
spurred
his
gelding
and
vanished
into
the
trees.

Once
he
was
gone,
the
woods
seemed
to
close
in
around
Bran.
The
snow
was
falling
more
heavily
now.
Where
it
touched
the
ground
it
melted,
but
all
about
him
rock
and
root
and
branch
wore
a
thin
blanket
of
white.
As
he
waited,
he
was
conscious
of
how
uncomfortable
he
felt.
He
could
not
feel
his
legs,
hanging
useless
in
the
stirrups,
but
the
strap
around
his
chest
was
tight
and
chafing,
and
the
melting
snow
had
soaked
through
his
gloves
to
chill
his
hands.
He
wondered
what
was
keeping
Theon
and
Maester
Luwin
and
Joseth
and
the
rest.

When
he
heard
the
rustle
of
leaves,
Bran
used
the
reins
to
make
Dancer
turn,
expecting
to
see
his
friends,
but
the
ragged
men
who
stepped
out
onto
the
bank
of
the
stream
were
strangers.

“Good
day
to
you,”
he
said
nervously.
One
look,
and
Bran
knew
they
were
neither
foresters
nor
farmers.
He
was
suddenly
conscious
of
how
richly
he
was
dressed.
His
surcoat
was
new,
dark
grey
wool
with
silver
buttons,
and
a
heavy
silver
pin
fastened
his
fur-trimmed
cloak
at
the
shoulders.
His
boots
and
gloves
were
lined
with
fur
as
well.

“All
alone,
are
you?”
said
the
biggest
of
them,
a
bald
man
with
a
raw
windburnt
face.
“Lost
in
the
wolfswood,
poor
lad.”

“I’m
not
lost.”
Bran
did
not
like
the
way
the
strangers
were
looking
at
him.
He
counted
four,
but
when
he
turned
his
head,
he
saw
two
others
behind
him.
“My
brother
rode
off
just
a
moment
ago,
and
my
guard
will
be
here
shortly.”

“Your
guard,
is
it?”
a
second
man
said.
Grey
stubble
covered
his
gaunt
face.
“And
what
would
they
be
guarding,
my
little
lord?
Is
that
a
silver
pin
I
see
there
on
your
cloak?”

“Pretty,”
said
a
woman’s
voice.
She
scarcely
looked
like
a
woman;
tall
and
lean,
with
the
same
hard
face
as
the
others,
her
hair
hidden
beneath
a
bowl-shaped
halfhelm.
The
spear
she
held
was
eight
feet
of
black
oak,
tipped
in
rusted
steel.

“Let’s
have
a
look,”
said
the
big
bald
man.

Bran
watched
him
anxiously.
The
man’s
clothes
were
filthy,
fallen
almost
to
pieces,
patched
here
with
brown
and
here
with
blue
and
there
with
a
dark
green,
and
faded
everywhere
to
grey,
but
once
that
cloak
might
have
been
black.
The
grey
stubbly
man
wore
black
rags
too,
he
saw
with
a
sudden
start.
Suddenly
Bran
remembered
the
oathbreaker
his
father
had
beheaded,
the
day
they
had
found
the
wolf
pups;
that
man
had
worn
black
as
well,
and
Father
said
he
had
been
a
deserter
from
the
Night’s
Watch.
No
man
is
more
dangerous,
he
remembered
Lord
Eddard
saying.
The
deserter
knows
his
life
is
forfeit
if
he
is
taken,
so
he
will
not
flinch
from
any
crime,
no
matter
how
vile
or
cruel.

“The
pin,
lad,”
the
big
man
said.
He
held
out
his
hand.

“We’ll
take
the
horse
too,”
said
another
of
them,
a
woman
shorter
than
Robb,
with
a
broad
fiat
face
and
lank
yellow
hair.
“Get
down,
and
be
quick
about
it.”
A
knife
slid
from
her
sleeve
into
her
hand,
its
edge
jagged
as
a
saw.

“No,”
Bran
blurted.
“I
can’t…”

The
big
man
grabbed
his
reins
before
Bran
could
think
to
wheel
Dancer
around
and
gallop
off.
“You
can,
lordling…
and
will,
if
you
know
what’s
good
for
you.”

“Stiv,
look
how
he’s
strapped
on.”
The
tall
woman
pointed
with
her
spear.
“Might
be
it’s
the
truth
he’s
telling.”

“Straps,
is
it?”
Stiv
said.
He
drew
a
dagger
from
a
sheath
at
his
belt.
“There’s
ways
to
deal
with
straps.”

“You
some
kind
of
cripple?”
asked
the
short
woman.

Bran
flared.
“I’m
Brandon
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
you
better
let
go
of
my
horse,
or
I’ll
see
you
all
dead.”

The
gaunt
man
with
the
grey
stubbled
face
laughed.
“The
boy’s
a
Stark,
true
enough.
Only
a
Stark
would
be
fool
enough
to
threaten
where
smarter
men
would
beg.”

“Cut
his
little
cock
off
and
stuff
it
in
his
mouth,”
suggested
the
short
woman.
“That
should
shut
him
up.”

“You’re
as
stupid
as
you
are
ugly,
Hali,”
said
the
tall
woman.
“The
boy’s
worth
nothing
dead,
but
alive…
gods
be
damned,
think
what
Mance
would
give
to
have
Benjen
Stark’s
own
blood
to
hostage!”

“Mance
be
damned,”
the
big
man
cursed.
“You
want
to
go
back
there,
Osha?
More
fool
you.
Think
the
white
walkers
will
care
if
you
have
a
hostage?”
He
turned
back
to
Bran
and
slashed
at
the
strap
around
his
thigh.
The
leather
parted
with
a
sigh.

The
stroke
had
been
quick
and
careless,
biting
deep.
Looking
down,
Bran
glimpsed
pale
flesh
where
the
wool
of
his
leggings
had
parted.
Then
the
blood
began
to
flow.
He
watched
the
red
stain
spread,
feeling
light-headed,
curiously
apart;
there
had
been
no
pain,
not
even
a
hint
of
feeling.
The
big
man
grunted
in
surprise.

“Put
down
your
steel
now,
and
I
promise
you
shall
have
a
quick
and
painless
death,”
Robb
called
out.

Bran
looked
up
in
desperate
hope,
and
there
he
was.
The
strength
of
the
words
were
undercut
by
the
way
his
voice
cracked
with
strain.
He
was
mounted,
the
bloody
carcass
of
an
elk
slung
across
the
back
of
his
horse,
his
sword
in
a
gloved
hand.

“The
brother,”
said
the
man
with
the
grey
stubbly
face.

“He’s
a
fierce
one,
he
is,”
mocked
the
short
woman.
Hali,
they
called
her.
“You
mean
to
fight
us,
boy?”

“Don’t
be
a
fool,
lad.
You’re
one
against
six.”
The
tall
woman,
Osha,
leveled
her
spear.
“Off
the
horse,
and
throw
down
the
sword.
We’ll
thank
you
kindly
for
the
mount
and
for
the
venison,
and
you
and
your
brother
can
be
on
your
way.”

Robb
whistled.
They
heard
the
faint
sound
of
soft
feet
on
wet
leaves.
The
undergrowth
parted,
low-hanging
branches
giving
up
their
accumulation
of
snow,
and
Grey
Wind
and
Summer
emerged
from
the
green.
Summer
sniffed
the
air
and
growled.

“Wolves,”
gasped
Hali.

“Direwolves,”
Bran
said.
Still
half-grown,
they
were
as
large
as
any
wolf
he
had
ever
seen,
but
the
differences
were
easy
to
spot,
if
you
knew
what
to
look
for.
Maester
Luwin
and
Farlen
the
kennelmaster
had
taught
him.
A
direwolf
had
a
bigger
head
and
longer
legs
in
proportion
to
its
body,
and
its
snout
and
jaw
were
markedly
leaner
and
more
pronounced.
There
was
something
gaunt
and
terrible
about
them
as
they
stood
there
amid
the
gently
falling
snow.
Fresh
blood
spotted
Grey
Wind’s
muzzle.

“Dogs,”
the
big
bald
man
said
contemptuously.
“Yet
I’m
told
there’s
nothing
like
a
wolfskin
cloak
to
warm
a
man
by
night.”
He
made
a
sharp
gesture.
“Take
them.”

Robb
shouted,
“Winterfell!”
and
kicked
his
horse.
The
gelding
plunged
down
the
bank
as
the
ragged
men
closed.
A
man
with
an
axe
rushed
in,
shouting
and
heedless.
Robb’s
sword
caught
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
sickening
crunch
and
a
spray
of
bright
blood.
The
man
with
the
gaunt
stubbly
face
made
a
grab
for
the
reins,
and
for
half
a
second
he
had
them…
and
then
Grey
Wind
was
on
him,
bearing
him
down.
He
fell
back
into
the
stream
with
a
splash
and
a
shout,
flailing
wildly
with
his
knife
as
his
head
went
under.
The
direwolf
plunged
in
after
him,
and
the
white
water
turned
red
where
they
had
vanished.

Robb
and
Osha
matched
blows
in
midstream.
Her
long
spear
was
a
steel-headed
serpent,
flashing
out
at
his
chest,
once,
twice,
three
times,
but
Robb
parried
every
thrust
with
his
longsword,
turning
the
point
aside.
On
the
fourth
or
fifth
thrust,
the
tall
woman
overextended
herself
and
lost
her
balance,
just
for
a
second.
Robb
charged,
riding
her
down.

A
few
feet
away,
Summer
darted
in
and
snapped
at
Hali.
The
knife
bit
at
his
flank.
Summer
slid
away,
snarling,
and
came
rushing
in
again.
This
time
his
jaws
closed
around
her
calf.
Holding
the
knife
with
both
hands,
the
small
woman
stabbed
down,
but
the
direwolf
seemed
to
sense
the
blade
coming.
He
pulled
free
for
an
instant,
his
mouth
full
of
leather
and
cloth
and
bloody
flesh.
When
Hali
stumbled
and
fell,
he
came
at
her
again,
slamming
her
backward,
teeth
tearing
at
her
belly.

The
sixth
man
ran
from
the
carnage…
but
not
far.
As
he
went
scrambling
up
the
far
side
of
the
bank,
Grey
Wind
emerged
from
the
stream,
dripping
wet.
He
shook
the
water
off
and
bounded
after
the
running
man,
hamstringing
him
with
a
single
snap
of
his
teeth,
and
going
for
the
throat
as
the
screaming
man
slid
back
down
toward
the
water.

And
then
there
was
no
one
left
but
the
big
man,
Stiv.
He
slashed
at
Bran’s
chest
strap,
grabbed
his
arm,
and
yanked.
Suddenly
Bran
was
falling.
He
sprawled
on
the
ground,
his
legs
tangled
under
him,
one
foot
in
the
stream.
He
could
not
feel
the
cold
of
the
water,
but
he
felt
the
steel
when
Stiv
pressed
his
dagger
to
his
throat.
“Back
away,”
the
man
warned,
“or
I’ll
open
the
boy’s
windpipe,
I
swear
it.”

Robb
reined
his
horse
in,
breathing
hard.
The
fury
went
out
of
his
eyes,
and
his
sword
arm
dropped.

In
that
moment
Bran
saw
everything.
Summer
was
savaging
Hali,
pulling
glistening
blue
snakes
from
her
belly.
Her
eyes
were
wide
and
staring.
Bran
could
not
tell
whether
she
was
alive
or
dead.
The
grey
stubbly
man
and
the
one
with
the
axe
lay
unmoving,
but
Osha
was
on
her
knees,
crawling
toward
her
fallen
spear.
Grey
Wind
padded
toward
her,
dripping
wet.
“Call
him
off!”
the
big
man
shouted.
“Call
them
both
off,
or
the
cripple
boy
dies
now!”

“Grey
Wind,
Summer,
to
me,”
Robb
said.

The
direwolves
stopped,
turned
their
heads.
Grey
Wind
loped
back
to
Robb.
Summer
stayed
where
he
was,
his
eyes
on
Bran
and
the
man
beside
him.
He
growled.
His
muzzle
was
wet
and
red,
but
his
eyes
burned.

Osha
used
the
butt
end
of
her
spear
to
lever
herself
back
to
her
feet.
Blood
leaked
from
a
wound
on
the
upper
arm
where
Robb
had
cut
her.
Bran
could
see
sweat
trickling
down
the
big
man’s
face.
Stiv
was
as
scared
as
he
was,
he
realized.
“Starks,”
the
man
muttered,
“bloody
Starks.”
He
raised
his
voice.
“Osha,
kill
the
wolves
and
get
his
sword.”

“Kill
them
yourself,”
she
replied.
“I’ll
not
be
getting
near
those
monsters.”

For
a
moment
Stiv
was
at
a
loss.
His
hand
trembled;
Bran
felt
a
trickle
of
blood
where
the
knife
pressed
against
his
neck.
The
stench
of
the
man
filled
his
nose;
he
smelled
of
fear.
“You,”
he
called
out
to
Robb.
“You
have
a
name?”

“I
am
Robb
Stark,
the
heir
to
Winterfell.”

“This
is
your
brother?”

“Yes.”

“You
want
him
alive,
you
do
what
I
say.
Off
the
horse.”

Robb
hesitated
a
moment.
Then,
slowly
and
deliberately,
he
dismounted
and
stood
with
his
sword
in
hand.

“Now
kill
the
wolves.”

Robb
did
not
move.

“You
do
it.
The
wolves
or
the
boy.”

“No!”
Bran
screamed.
If
Robb
did
as
they
asked,
Stiv
would
kill
them
both
anyway,
once
the
direwolves
were
dead.

The
bald
man
took
hold
of
his
hair
with
his
free
hand
and
twisted
it
cruelly,
till
Bran
sobbed
in
pain.
“You
shut
your
mouth,
cripple,
you
hear
me?”
He
twisted
harder.
“You
hear
me?”

A
low
thrum
came
from
the
woods
behind
them.
Stiv
gave
a
choked
gasp
as
a
half
foot
of
razor-tipped
broadhead
suddenly
exploded
out
of
his
chest.
The
arrow
was
bright
red,
as
if
it
had
been
painted
in
blood.

The
dagger
fell
away
from
Bran’s
throat.
The
big
man
swayed
and
collapsed,
facedown
in
the
stream.
The
arrow
broke
beneath
him.
Bran
watched
his
life
go
swirling
off
in
the
water.

Osha
glanced
around
as
Father’s
guardsmen
appeared
from
beneath
the
trees,
steel
in
hand.
She
threw
down
her
spear.
“Mercy,
m’lord,”
she
called
to
Robb.

The
guardsmen
had
a
strange,
pale
look
to
their
faces
as
they
took
in
the
scene
of
slaughter.
They
eyed
the
wolves
uncertainly,
and
when
Summer
returned
to
Hali’s
corpse
to
feed,
Joseth
dropped
his
knife
and
scrambled
for
the
bush,
heaving.
Even
Maester
Luwin
seemed
shocked
as
he
stepped
from
behind
a
tree,
but
only
for
an
instant.
Then
he
shook
his
head
and
waded
across
the
stream
to
Bran’s
side.
“Are
you
hurt?”

“He
cut
my
leg,”
Bran
said,
“but
I
couldn’t
feel
it.”

As
the
maester
knelt
to
examine
the
wound,
Bran
turned
his
head.
Theon
Greyjoy
stood
beside
a
sentinel
tree,
his
bow
in
hand.
He
was
smiling.
Ever
smiling.
A
half-dozen
arrows
were
thrust
into
the
soft
ground
at
his
feet,
but
it
had
taken
only
one.
“A
dead
enemy
is
a
thing
of
beauty,”
he
announced.

“Jon
always
said
you
were
an
ass,
Greyjoy,”
Robb
said
loudly.
“I
ought
to
chain
you
up
in
the
yard
and
let
Bran
take
a
few
practice
shots
at
you.”

“You
should
be
thanking
me
for
saving
your
brother’s
life.”

“What
if
you
had
missed
the
shot?”
Robb
said.
“What
if
you’d
only
wounded
him?
What
if
you
had
made
his
hand
jump,
or
hit
Bran
instead?
For
all
you
knew,
the
man
might
have
been
wearing
a
breastplate,
all
you
could
see
was
the
back
of
his
cloak.
What
would
have
happened
to
my
brother
then?
Did
you
ever
think
of
that,
Greyjoy?”

Theon’s
smile
was
gone.
He
gave
a
sullen
shrug
and
began
to
pull
his
arrows
from
the
ground,
one
by
one.

Robb
glared
at
his
guardsmen.
“Where
were
you?”
he
demanded
of
them.
“I
was
sure
you
were
close
behind
us.”

The
men
traded
unhappy
glances.
“We
were
following,
m’lord,”
said
Quent,
the
youngest
of
them,
his
beard
a
soft
brown
fuzz.
“Only
first
we
waited
for
Maester
Luwin
and
his
ass,
begging
your
pardons,
and
then,
well,
as
it
were…”
He
glanced
over
at
Theon
and
quickly
looked
away,
abashed.

“I
spied
a
turkey,”
Theon
said,
annoyed
by
the
question.
“How
was
I
to
know
that
you’d
leave
the
boy
alone?”

Robb
turned
his
head
to
look
at
Theon
once
more.
Bran
had
never
seen
him
so
angry,
yet
he
said
nothing.
Finally
he
knelt
beside
Maester
Luwin.
“How
badly
is
my
brother
wounded?”

“No
more
than
a
scratch,”
the
maester
said.
He
wet
a
cloth
in
the
stream
to
clean
the
cut.
“Two
of
them
wear
the
black,”
he
told
Robb
as
he
worked.

Robb
glanced
over
at
where
Stiv
lay
sprawled
in
the
stream,
his
ragged
black
cloak
moving
fitfully
as
the
rushing
waters
tugged
at
it.
“Deserters
from
the
Night’s
Watch,”
he
said
grimly.
“They
must
have
been
fools,
to
come
so
close
to
Winterfell.”

“Folly
and
desperation
are
ofttimes
hard
to
tell
apart,”
said
Maester
Luwin.

“Shall
we
bury
them,
m’lord?”
asked
Quent.

“They
would
not
have
buried
us,”
Robb
said.
“Hack
off
their
heads,
we’ll
send
them
back
to
the
Wall.
Leave
the
rest
for
the
carrion
crows.”

“And
this
one?”
Quent
jerked
a
thumb
toward
Osha.

Robb
walked
over
to
her.
She
was
a
head
taller
than
he
was,
but
she
dropped
to
her
knees
at
his
approach.
“Give
me
my
life,
m’lord
of
Stark,
and
I
am
yours.”

“Mine?
What
would
I
do
with
an
oathbreaker?”

“I
broke
no
oaths.
Stiv
and
Wallen
flew
down
off
the
Wall,
not
me.
The
black
crows
got
no
place
for
women.”

Theon
Greyjoy
sauntered
closer.
“Give
her
to
the
wolves,”
he
urged
Robb.
The
woman’s
eyes
went
to
what
was
left
of
Hali,
and
just
as
quickly
away.
She
shuddered.
Even
the
guardsmen
looked
queasy.

“She’s
a
woman,”
Robb
said.

“A
wildling,”
Bran
told
him.
“She
said
they
should
keep
me
alive
so
they
could
take
me
to
Mance
Rayder.”

“Do
you
have
a
name?”
Robb
asked
her.

“Osha,
as
it
please
the
lord,”
she
muttered
sourly.

Maester
Luwin
stood.
“We
might
do
well
to
question
her.”

Bran
could
see
the
relief
on
his
brother’s
face.
“As
you
say,
Maester.
Wayn,
bind
her
hands.
She’ll
come
back
to
Winterfell
with
us…
and
live
or
die
by
the
truths
she
gives
us.”





TYRION

“You
want
eat?”
Mord
asked,
glowering.
He
had
a
plate
of
oiled
beans
in
one
thick,
stub-fingered
hand.

Tyrion
Lannister
was
starved,
but
he
refused
to
let
this
brute
see
him
cringe.
“A
leg
of
lamb
would
be
pleasant,”
he
said,
from
the
heap
of
soiled
straw
in
the
corner
of
his
cell.
“Perhaps
a
dish
of
peas
and
onions,
some
fresh
baked
bread
with
butter,
and
a
flagon
of
mulled
wine
to
wash
it
down.
Or
beer,
if
that’s
easier.
I
try
not
to
be
overly
particular.”

“Is
beans,”
Mord
said.
“Here.”
He
held
out
the
plate.

Tyrion
sighed.
The
turnkey
was
twenty
stone
of
gross
stupidity,
with
brown
rotting
teeth
and
small
dark
eyes.
The
left
side
of
his
face
was
slick
with
scar
where
an
axe
had
cut
off
his
ear
and
part
of
his
cheek.
He
was
as
predictable
as
he
was
ugly,
but
Tyrion
was
hungry.
He
reached
up
for
the
plate.

Mord
jerked
it
away,
grinning.
“Is
here,”
he
said,
holding
it
out
beyond
Tyrion’s
reach.

The
dwarf
climbed
stiffly
to
his
feet,
every
joint
aching.
“Must
we
play
the
same
fool’s
game
with
every
meal?”
He
made
another
grab
for
the
beans.

Mord
shambled
backward,
grinning
through
his
rotten
teeth.
“Is
here,
dwarf
man.”
He
held
the
plate
out
at
arm’s
length,
over
the
edge
where
the
cell
ended
and
the
sky
began.
“You
not
want
eat?
Here.
Come
take.”

Tyrion’s
arms
were
too
short
to
reach
the
plate,
and
he
was
not
about
to
step
that
close
to
the
edge.
All
it
would
take
would
be
a
quick
shove
of
Mord’s
heavy
white
belly,
and
he
would
end
up
a
sickening
red
splotch
on
the
stones
of
Sky,
like
so
many
other
prisoners
of
the
Eyrie
over
the
centuries.
“Come
to
think
on
it,
I’m
not
hungry
after
all,”
he
declared,
retreating
to
the
corner
of
his
cell.

Mord
grunted
and
opened
his
thick
fingers.
The
wind
took
the
plate,
flipping
it
over
as
it
fell.
A
handful
of
beans
sprayed
back
at
them
as
the
food
tumbled
out
of
sight.
The
turnkey
laughed,
his
gut
shaking
like
a
bowl
of
pudding.

Tyrion
felt
a
pang
of
rage.
“You
fucking
son
of
a
pox-ridden
ass,”
he
spat.
“I
hope
you
die
of
a
bloody
flux.”

For
that,
Mord
gave
him
a
kick,
driving
a
steel-toed
boot
hard
into
Tyrion’s
ribs
on
the
way
out.
“I
take
it
back!”
he
gasped
as
he
doubled
over
on
the
straw.
“I’ll
kill
you
myself,
I
swear
it!”
The
heavy
iron-bound
door
slammed
shut.
Tyrion
heard
the
rattle
of
keys.

For
a
small
man,
he
had
been
cursed
with
a
dangerously
big
mouth,
he
reflected
as
he
crawled
back
to
his
corner
of
what
the
Arryns
laughably
called
their
dungeon.
He
huddled
beneath
the
thin
blanket
that
was
his
only
bedding,
staring
out
at
a
blaze
of
empty
blue
sky
and
distant
mountains
that
seemed
to
go
on
forever,
wishing
he
still
had
the
shadowskin
cloak
he’d
won
from
Marillion
at
dice,
after
the
singer
had
stolen
it
off
the
body
of
that
brigand
chief.
The
skin
had
smelled
of
blood
and
mold,
but
it
was
warm
and
thick.
Mord
had
taken
it
the
moment
he
laid
eyes
on
it.

The
wind
tugged
at
his
blanket
with
gusts
sharp
as
talons.
His
cell
was
miserably
small,
even
for
a
dwarf.
Not
five
feet
away,
where
a
wall
ought
to
have
been,
where
a
wall
would
be
in
a
proper
dungeon,
the
floor
ended
and
the
sky
began.
He
had
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine,
and
the
moon
and
stars
by
night,
but
Tyrion
would
have
traded
it
all
in
an
instant
for
the
dankest,
gloomiest
pit
in
the
bowels
of
the
Casterly
Rock.

“You
fly,”
Mord
had
promised
him,
when
he’d
shoved
him
into
the
cell.
“Twenty
day,
thirty,
fifty
maybe.
Then
you
fly.”

The
Arryns
kept
the
only
dungeon
in
the
realm
where
the
prisoners
were
welcome
to
escape
at
will.
That
first
day,
after
girding
up
his
courage
for
hours,
Tyrion
had
lain
flat
on
his
stomach
and
squirmed
to
the
edge,
to
poke
out
his
head
and
look
down.
Sky
was
six
hundred
feet
below,
with
nothing
between
but
empty
air.
If
he
craned
his
neck
out
as
far
as
it
could
go,
he
could
see
other
cells
to
his
right
and
left
and
above
him.
He
was
a
bee
in
a
stone
honeycomb,
and
someone
had
torn
off
his
wings.

It
was
cold
in
the
cell,
the
wind
screamed
night
and
day,
and
worst
of
all,
the
floor
sloped.
Ever
so
slightly,
yet
it
was
enough.
He
was
afraid
to
close
his
eyes,
afraid
that
he
might
roll
over
in
his
steep
and
wake
in
sudden
terror
as
he
went
sliding
off
the
edge.
Small
wonder
the
sky
cells
drove
men
mad.

Gods
save
me,
some
previous
tenant
had
written
on
the
wall
in
something
that
looked
suspiciously
like
blood,
the
blue
is
calling.
At
first
Tyrion
wondered
who
he’d
been,
and
what
had
become
of
him;
later,
he
decided
that
he
would
rather
not
know.

If
only
he
had
shut
his
mouth…

The
wretched
boy
had
started
it,
looking
down
on
him
from
a
throne
of
carved
weirwood
beneath
the
moon-and-falcon
banners
of
House
Arryn.
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
looked
down
on
all
his
life,
but
seldom
by
rheumy-eyed
six-year-olds
who
needed
to
stuff
fat
cushions
under
their
cheeks
to
lift
them
to
the
height
of
a
man.
“Is
he
the
bad
man?”
the
boy
had
asked,
clutching
his
doll.

“He
is,”
the
Lady
Lysa
had
said
from
the
lesser
throne
beside
him.
She
was
all
in
blue,
powdered
and
perfumed
for
the
suitors
who
filled
her
court.

“He’s
so
small,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
said,
giggling.

“This
is
Tyrion
the
Imp,
of
House
Lannister,
who
murdered
your
father.”
She
raised
her
voice
so
it
carried
down
the
length
of
High
Hall
of
the
Eyrie,
ringing
off
the
milk-white
walls
and
the
slender
pillars,
so
every
man
could
hear
it.
“He
slew
the
Hand
of
the
King!”

“Oh,
did
I
kill
him
too?”
Tyrion
had
said,
like
a
fool.

That
would
have
been
a
very
good
time
to
have
kept
his
mouth
closed
and
his
head
bowed.
He
could
see
that
now;
seven
hells,
he
had
seen
it
then.
The
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns
was
long
and
austere,
with
a
forbidding
coldness
to
its
walls
of
blue-veined
white
marble,
but
the
faces
around
him
had
been
colder
by
far.
The
power
of
Casterly
Rock
was
far
away,
and
there
were
no
friends
of
the
Lannisters
in
the
Vale
of
Arryn.
Submission
and
silence
would
have
been
his
best
defenses.

But
Tyrion’s
mood
had
been
too
foul
for
sense.
To
his
shame,
he
had
faltered
during
the
last
leg
of
their
day-long
climb
up
to
the
Eyrie,
his
stunted
legs
unable
to
take
him
any
higher.
Bronn
had
carried
him
the
rest
of
the
way,
and
the
humiliation
poured
oil
on
the
flames
of
his
anger.
“It
would
seem
I’ve
been
a
busy
little
fellow,”
he
said
with
bitter
sarcasm.
“I
wonder
when
I
found
the
time
to
do
all
this
slaying
and
murdering.”

He
ought
to
have
remembered
who
he
was
dealing
with.
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
half-sane
weakling
son
had
not
been
known
at
court
for
their
love
of
wit,
especially
when
it
was
directed
at
them.

“Imp,”
Lysa
said
coldly,
“you
will
guard
that
mocking
tongue
of
yours
and
speak
to
my
son
politely,
or
I
promise
you
will
have
cause
to
regret
it.
Remember
where
you
are.
This
is
the
Eyrie,
and
these
are
knights
of
the
Vale
you
see
around
you,
true
men
who
loved
Jon
Arryn
well.
Every
one
of
them
would
die
for
me.”

“Lady
Arryn,
should
any
harm
come
to
me,
my
brother
Jaime
will
be
pleased
to
see
that
they
do.”
Even
as
he
spat
out
the
words,
Tyrion
knew
they
were
folly.

“Can
you
fly,
my
lord
of
Lannister?”
Lady
Lysa
asked.
“Does
a
dwarf
have
wings?
If
not,
you
would
be
wiser
to
swallow
the
next
threat
that
comes
to
mind.”

“I
made
no
threats,”
Tyrion
said.
“That
was
a
promise.”

Little
Lord
Robert
hopped
to
his
feet
at
that,
so
upset
he
dropped
his
doll.
“You
can’t
hurt
us,”
he
screamed.
“No
one
can
hurt
us
here.
Tell
him,
Mother,
tell
him
he
can’t
hurt
us
here.”
The
boy
began
to
twitch.

“The
Eyrie
is
impregnable,”
Lysa
Arryn
declared
calmly.
She
drew
her
son
close,
holding
him
safe
in
the
circle
of
her
plump
white
arms.
“The
Imp
is
trying
to
frighten
us,
sweet
baby.
The
Lannisters
are
all
liars.
No
one
will
hurt
my
sweet
boy.”

The
hell
of
it
was,
she
was
no
doubt
right.
Having
seen
what
it
took
to
get
here,
Tyrion
could
well
imagine
how
it
would
be
for
a
knight
trying
to
fight
his
way
up
in
armor,
while
stones
and
arrows
poured
down
from
above
and
enemies
contested
with
him
for
every
step.
Nightmare
did
not
begin
to
describe
it.
Small
wonder
the
Eyrie
had
never
been
taken.

Still,
Tyrion
had
been
unable
to
silence
himself.
“Not
impregnable,”
he
said,
“merely
inconvenient.”

Young
Robert
pointed
down,
his
hand
trembling.
“You’re
a
liar.
Mother,
I
want
to
see
him
fly.”
Two
guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
seized
Tyrion
by
the
arms,
lifting
him
off
his
floor.

The
gods
only
know
what
might
have
happened
then
were
it
not
for
Catelyn
Stark.
“Sister,”
she
called
out
from
where
she
stood
below
the
thrones,
“I
beg
you
to
remember,
this
man
is
my
prisoner.
I
will
not
have
him
harmed.”

Lysa
Arryn
glanced
at
her
sister
coolly
for
a
moment,
then
rose
and
swept
down
on
Tyrion,
her
long
skirts
trailing
after
her.
For
an
instant
he
feared
she
would
strike
him,
but
instead
she
commanded
them
to
release
him.
Her
men
shoved
him
to
the
floor,
his
legs
went
out
from
under
him,
and
Tyrion
fell.

He
must
have
made
quite
a
sight
as
he
struggled
to
his
knees,
only
to
feel
his
right
leg
spasm,
sending
him
sprawling
once
more.
Laughter
boomed
up
and
down
the
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns.

“My
sister’s
little
guest
is
too
weary
to
stand,”
Lady
Lysa
announced.
“Ser
Vardis,
take
him
down
to
the
dungeon.
A
rest
in
one
of
our
sky
cells
will
do
him
much
good.”

The
guardsmen
jerked
him
upright.
Tyrion
Lannister
dangled
between
them,
kicking
feebly,
his
face
red
with
shame.
“I
will
remember
this,”
he
told
them
all
as
they
carried
him
off.

And
so
he
did,
for
all
the
good
it
did
him.

At
first
he
had
consoled
himself
that
this
imprisonment
could
not
last
long.
Lysa
Arryn
wanted
to
humble
him,
that
was
all.
She
would
send
for
him
again,
and
soon.
If
not
her,
then
Catelyn
Stark
would
want
to
question
him.
This
time
he
would
guard
his
tongue
more
closely.
They
dare
not
kill
him
out
of
hand;
he
was
still
a
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock,
and
if
they
shed
his
blood,
it
would
mean
war.
Or
so
he
had
told
himself.

Now
he
was
not
so
certain.

Perhaps
his
captors
only
meant
to
let
him
rot
here,
but
he
feared
he
did
not
have
the
strength
to
rot
for
long.
He
was
growing
weaker
every
day,
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
Mord’s
kicks
and
blows
did
him
serious
harm,
provided
the
gaoler
did
not
starve
him
to
death
first.
A
few
more
nights
of
cold
and
hunger,
and
the
blue
would
start
calling
to
him
too.

He
wondered
what
was
happening
beyond
the
walls
(such
as
they
were)
of
his
cell.
Lord
Tywin
would
surely
have
sent
out
riders
when
the
word
reached
him.
Jaime
might
be
leading
a
host
through
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
even
now…
unless
he
was
riding
north
against
Winterfell
instead.
Did
anyone
outside
the
Vale
even
suspect
where
Catelyn
Stark
had
taken
him?
He
wondered
what
Cersei
would
do
when
she
heard.
The
king
could
order
him
freed,
but
would
Robert
listen
to
his
queen
or
his
Hand?
Tyrion
had
no
illusions
about
the
king’s
love
for
his
sister.

If
Cersei
kept
her
wits
about
her,
she
would
insist
the
king
sit
in
judgment
of
Tyrion
himself.
Even
Ned
Stark
could
scarcely
object
to
that,
not
without
impugning
the
honor
of
the
king.
And
Tyrion
would
be
only
too
glad
to
take
his
chances
in
a
trial.
Whatever
murders
they
might
lay
at
his
door,
the
Starks
had
no
proof
of
anything
so
far
as
he
could
see.
Let
them
make
their
case
before
the
Iron
Throne
and
the
lords
of
the
land.
It
would
be
the
end
of
them.
If
only
Cersei
were
clever
enough
to
see
that…

Tyrion
Lannister
sighed.
His
sister
was
not
without
a
certain
low
cunning,
but
her
pride
blinded
her.
She
would
see
the
insult
in
this,
not
the
opportunity.
And
Jaime
was
even
worse,
rash
and
headstrong
and
quick
to
anger.
His
brother
never
untied
a
knot
when
he
could
slash
it
in
two
with
his
sword.

He
wondered
which
of
them
had
sent
the
footpad
to
silence
the
Stark
boy,
and
whether
they
had
truly
conspired
at
the
death
of
Lord
Arryn.
If
the
old
Hand
had
been
murdered,
it
was
deftly
and
subtly
done.
Men
of
his
age
died
of
sudden
illness
all
the
time.
In
contrast,
sending
some
oaf
with
a
stolen
knife
after
Brandon
Stark
struck
him
as
unbelievably
clumsy.
And
wasn’t
that
peculiar,
come
to
think
on
it…

Tyrion
shivered.
Now
there
was
a
nasty
suspicion.
Perhaps
the
direwolf
and
the
lion
were
not
the
only
beasts
in
the
woods,
and
if
that
was
true,
someone
was
using
him
as
a
catspaw.
Tyrion
Lannister
hated
being
used.

He
would
have
to
get
out
of
here,
and
soon.
His
chances
of
overpowering
Mord
were
small
to
none,
and
no
one
was
about
to
smuggle
him
a
six-hundred-foot-long
rope,
so
he
would
have
to
talk
himself
free.
His
mouth
had
gotten
him
into
this
cell;
it
could
damn
well
get
him
out.

Tyrion
pushed
himself
to
his
feet,
doing
his
best
to
ignore
the
slope
of
the
floor
beneath
him,
with
its
ever-so-subtle
tug
toward
the
edge.
He
hammered
on
the
door
with
a
fist.
“Mord!”
he
shouted.
“Turnkey!
Mord,
I
want
you!”
He
had
to
keep
it
up
a
good
ten
minutes
before
he
heard
footsteps.
Tyrion
stepped
back
an
instant
before
the
door
opened
with
a
crash.

“Making
noise,”
Mord
growled,
with
blood
in
his
eyes.
Dangling
from
one
meaty
hand
was
a
leather
strap,
wide
and
thick,
doubled
over
in
his
fist.

Never
show
them
you’re
afraid,
Tyrion
reminded
himself.
“How
would
you
like
to
be
rich?”
he
asked.

Mord
hit
him.
He
swung
the
strap
backhand,
lazily,
but
the
leather
caught
Tyrion
high
on
the
arm.
The
force
of
it
staggered
him,
and
the
pain
made
him
grit
his
teeth.
“No
mouth,
dwarf
man,”
Mord
warned
him.

“Gold,”
Tyrion
said,
miming
a
smile.
“Casterly
Rock
is
full
of
gold…
ahhhh…”
This
time
the
blow
was
a
forehand,
and
Mord
put
more
of
his
arm
into
the
swing,
making
the
leather
crack
and
jump.
It
caught
Tyrion
in
the
ribs
and
dropped
him
to
his
knees,
wimpering.
He
forced
himself
to
look
up
at
the
gaoler.
“As
rich
as
the
Lannisters,”
he
wheezed.
“That’s
what
they
say,
Mord—”

Mord
grunted.
The
strap
whistled
through
the
air
and
smashed
Tyrion
full
in
the
face.
The
pain
was
so
bad
he
did
not
remember
falling,
but
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
was
on
the
floor
of
his
cell.
His
ear
was
ringing,
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood.
He
groped
for
purchase,
to
push
himself
up,
and
his
fingers
brushed
against…
nothing.
Tyrion
snatched
his
hand
back
as
fast
as
if
it
had
been
scalded,
and
tried
his
best
to
stop
breathing.
He
had
fallen
right
on
the
edge,
inches
from
the
blue.

“More
to
say?”
Mord
held
the
strap
between
his
fists
and
gave
it
a
sharp
pull.
The
snap
made
Tyrion
jump.
The
turnkey
laughed.

He
won’t
push
me
over,
Tyrion
told
himself
desperately
as
he
crawled
away
from
the
edge.
Catelyn
Stark
wants
me
alive,
he
doesn’t
dare
kill
me.
He
wiped
the
blood
off
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand,
grinned,
and
said,
“That
was
a
stiff
one,
Mord.”
The
gaoler
squinted
at
him,
trying
to
decide
if
he
was
being
mocked.
“I
could
make
good
use
of
a
strong
man
like
you.”
The
strap
flew
at
him,
but
this
time
Tyrion
was
able
to
cringe
away
from
it.
He
took
a
glancing
blow
to
the
shoulder,
nothing
more.
“Gold,”
he
repeated,
scrambling
backward
like
a
crab,
“more
gold
than
you’ll
see
here
in
a
lifetime.
Enough
to
buy
land,
women,
horses…
you
could
be
a
lord.
Lord
Mord.”
Tyrion
hawked
up
a
glob
of
blood
and
phlegm
and
spat
it
out
into
the
sky.

“Is
no
gold,”
Mord
said.

He’s
listening!
Tyrion
thought.
“They
relieved
me
of
my
purse
when
they
captured
me,
but
the
gold
is
still
mine.
Catelyn
Stark
might
take
a
man
prisoner,
but
she’d
never
stoop
to
rob
him.
That
wouldn’t
be
honorable.
Help
me,
and
all
the
gold
is
yours.”
Mord’s
strap
licked
out,
but
it
was
a
halfhearted,
desultory
swing,
slow
and
contemptuous.
Tyrion
caught
the
leather
in
his
hand
and
held
it
prisoned.
“There
will
be
no
risk
to
you.
All
you
need
do
is
deliver
a
message.”

The
gaoler
yanked
his
leather
strap
free
of
Tyrion’s
grasp.
“Message,”
he
said,
as
if
he
had
never
heard
the
word
before.
His
frown
made
deep
creases
in
his
brow.

“You
heard
me,
my
lord.
Only
carry
my
word
to
your
lady.
Tell
her…”
What?
What
would
possibly
make
Lysa
Anyn
relent?
The
inspiration
came
to
Tyrion
Lannister
suddenly.
“…tell
her
that
I
wish
to
confess
my
crimes.”

Mord
raised
his
arm
and
Tyrion
braced
himself
for
another
blow,
but
the
turnkey
hesitated.
Suspicion
and
greed
warred
in
his
eyes.
He
wanted
that
gold,
yet
he
feared
a
trick;
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
often
been
tricked.
“Is
lie,”
he
muttered
darkly.
“Dwarf
man
cheat
me.”

“I
will
put
my
promise
in
writing,”
Tyrion
vowed.

Some
illiterates
held
writing
in
disdain;
others
seemed
to
have
a
superstitious
reverence
for
the
written
word,
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic.
Fortunately,
Mord
was
one
of
the
latter.
The
turnkey
lowered
the
strap.
“Writing
down
gold.
Much
gold.”

“Oh,
much
gold,”
Tyrion
assured
him.
“The
purse
is
just
a
taste,
my
friend.
My
brother
wears
armor
of
solid
gold
plate.”
In
truth,
Jaime’s
armor
was
gilded
steel,
but
this
oaf
would
never
know
the
difference.

Mord
fingered
his
strap
thoughtfully,
but
in
the
end,
he
relented
and
went
to
fetch
paper
and
ink.
When
the
letter
was
written,
the
gaoler
frowned
at
it
suspiciously.
“Now
deliver
my
message,”
Tyrion
urged.

He
was
shivering
in
his
sleep
when
they
came
for
him,
late
that
night.
Mord
opened
the
door
but
kept
his
silence.
Ser
Vardis
Egen
woke
Tyrion
with
the
point
of
his
boot.
“On
your
feet,
Imp.
My
lady
wants
to
see
you.”

Tyrion
rubbed
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
and
put
on
a
grimace
he
scarcely
felt.
“No
doubt
she
does,
but
what
makes
you
think
I
wish
to
see
her?”

Ser
Vardis
frowned.
Tyrion
remembered
him
well
from
the
years
he
had
spent
at
King’s
Landing
as
the
captain
of
the
Hand’s
household
guard.
A
square,
plain
face,
silver
hair,
a
heavy
build,
and
no
humor
whatsoever.
“Your
wishes
are
not
my
concern.
On
your
feet,
or
I’ll
have
you
carried.”

Tyrion
clambered
awkwardly
to
his
feet.
“A
cold
night,”
he
said
casually,
“and
the
High
Hall
is
so
drafty.
I
don’t
wish
to
catch
a
chill.
Mord,
if
you
would
be
so
good,
fetch
my
cloak.”

The
gaoler
squinted
at
him,
face
dull
with
suspicion.

“My
cloak,”
Tyrion
repeated.
“The
shadowskin
you
took
from
me
for
safekeeping.
You
recall.”

“Get
him
the
damnable
cloak,”
Ser
Vardis
said.

Mord
did
not
dare
grumble.
He
gave
Tyrion
a
glare
that
promised
future
retribution,
yet
he
went
for
the
cloak.
When
he
draped
it
around
his
prisoner’s
neck,
Tyrion
smiled.
“My
thanks.
I
shall
think
of
you
whenever
I
wear
it.”
He
flung
the
trailing
end
of
the
long
fur
over
his
right
shoulder,
and
felt
warm
for
the
first
time
in
days.
“Lead
on,
Ser
Vardis.”

The
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns
was
aglow
with
the
light
of
fifty
torches,
burning
in
the
sconces
along
the
walls.
The
Lady
Lysa
wore
black
silk,
with
the
moon-and-falcon
sewn
on
her
breast
in
pearls.
Since
she
did
not
look
the
sort
to
join
the
Night’s
Watch,
Tyrion
could
only
imagine
that
she
had
decided
mourning
clothes
were
appropriate
garb
for
a
confession.
Her
long
auburn
hair,
woven
into
an
elaborate
braid,
fell
across
her
left
shoulder.
The
taller
throne
beside
her
was
empty;
no
doubt
the
little
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
was
off
shaking
in
his
sleep.
Tyrion
was
thankful
for
that
much,
at
least.

He
bowed
deeply
and
took
a
moment
to
glance
around
the
hall.
Lady
Arryn
had
summoned
her
knights
and
retainers
to
hear
his
confession,
as
he
had
hoped.
He
saw
Ser
Brynden
Tully’s
craggy
face
and
Lord
Nestor
Royce’s
bluff
one.
Beside
Nestor
stood
a
younger
man
with
fierce
black
side-whiskers
who
could
only
be
his
heir,
Ser
Albar.
Most
of
the
principal
houses
of
the
Vale
were
represented.
Tyrion
noted
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
slender
as
a
sword,
Lord
Hunter
with
his
gouty
legs,
the
widowed
Lady
Waynwood
surrounded
by
her
sons.
Others
sported
sigils
he
did
not
know;
broken
lance,
green
viper,
burning
tower,
winged
chalice.

Among
the
lords
of
the
Vale
were
several
of
his
companions
from
the
high
road;
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel,
pale
from
half-healed
wounds,
stood
with
Ser
Willis
Wode
beside
him.
Marillion
the
singer
had
found
a
new
woodharp.
Tyrion
smiled;
whatever
happened
here
tonight,
he
did
not
wish
it
to
happen
in
secret,
and
there
was
no
one
like
a
singer
for
spreading
a
story
near
and
far.

In
the
rear
of
the
hall,
Bronn
lounged
beneath
a
pillar.
The
freerider’s
black
eyes
were
fixed
on
Tyrion,
and
his
hand
lay
lightly
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
Tyrion
gave
him
a
long
look,
wondering…

Catelyn
Stark
spoke
first.
“You
wish
to
confess
your
crimes,
we
are
told.”

“I
do,
my
lady,”
Tyrion
answered.

Lysa
Arryn
smiled
at
her
sister.
“The
sky
cells
always
break
them.
The
gods
can
see
them
there,
and
there
is
no
darkness
to
hide
in.”

“He
does
not
look
broken
to
me,”
Lady
Catelyn
said.

Lady
Lysa
paid
her
no
mind.
“Say
what
you
will,”
she
commanded
Tyrion.

And
now
to
roll
the
dice,
he
thought
with
another
quick
glance
back
at
Bronn.
“Where
to
begin?
I
am
a
vile
little
man,
I
confess
it.
My
crimes
and
sins
are
beyond
counting,
my
lords
and
ladies.
I
have
lain
with
whores,
not
once
but
hundreds
of
times.
I
have
wished
my
own
lord
father
dead,
and
my
sister,
our
gracious
queen,
as
well.”
Behind
him,
someone
chuckled.
“I
have
not
always
treated
my
servants
with
kindness.
I
have
gambled.
I
have
even
cheated,
I
blush
to
admit.
I
have
said
many
cruel
and
malicious
things
about
the
noble
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court.”
That
drew
outright
laughter.
“Once
I—”

“Silence!”
Lysa
Arryn’s
pale
round
face
had
turned
a
burning
pink.
“What
do
you
imagine
you
are
doing,
dwarf?”

Tyrion
cocked
his
head
to
one
side.
“Why,
confessing
my
crimes,
my
lady—”

Catelyn
Stark
took
a
step
forward.
“You
are
accused
of
sending
a
hired
knife
to
slay
my
son
Bran
in
his
bed,
and
of
conspiring
to
murder
Lord
Jon
Arryn,
the
Hand
of
the
King.”

Tyrion
gave
a
helpless
shrug.
“Those
crimes
I
cannot
confess,
I
fear.
I
know
nothing
of
any
murders.”

Lady
Lysa
rose
from
her
weirwood
throne.
“I
will
not
be
made
mock
of.
You
have
had
your
little
jape,
Imp.
I
trust
you
enjoyed
it.
Ser
Vardis,
take
him
back
to
the
dungeon…
but
this
time
find
him
a
smaller
cell,
with
a
floor
more
sharply
sloped.”

“Is
this
how
justice
is
done
in
the
Vale?”
Tyrion
roared,
so
loudly
that
Ser
Vardis
froze
for
an
instant.
“Does
honor
stop
at
the
Bloody
Gate?
You
accuse
me
of
crimes,
I
deny
them,
so
you
throw
me
into
an
open
cell
to
freeze
and
starve.”
He
lifted
his
head,
to
give
them
all
a
good
look
at
the
bruises
Mord
had
left
on
his
face.
“Where
is
the
king’s
justice?
Is
the
Eyrie
not
part
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms?
I
stand
accused,
you
say.
Very
well.
I
demand
a
trial!
Let
me
speak,
and
let
my
truth
or
falsehood
be
judged
openly,
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

A
low
murmuring
filled
the
High
Hall.
He
had
her,
Tyrion
knew.
He
was
highborn,
the
son
of
the
most
powerful
lord
in
the
realm,
the
brother
of
the
queen.
He
could
not
be
denied
a
trial.
Guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
had
started
toward
Tyrion,
but
Ser
Vardis
bid
them
halt
and
looked
to
Lady
Lysa.

Her
small
mouth
twitched
in
a
petulant
smile.
“If
you
are
tried
and
found
to
be
guilty
of
the
crimes
for
which
you
stand
accused,
then
by
the
king’s
own
laws,
you
must
pay
with
your
life’s
blood.
We
keep
no
headsman
in
the
Eyrie,
my
lord
of
Lannister.
Open
the
Moon
Door.”

The
press
of
spectators
parted.
A
narrow
weirwood
door
stood
between
two
slender
marble
pillars,
a
crescent
moon
carved
in
the
white
wood.
Those
standing
closest
edged
backward
as
a
pair
of
guardsmen
marched
through.
One
man
removed
the
heavy
bronze
bars;
the
second
pulled
the
door
inward.
Their
blue
cloaks
rose
snapping
from
their
shoulders,
caught
in
the
sudden
gust
of
wind
that
came
howling
through
the
open
door.
Beyond
was
the
emptiness
of
the
night
sky,
speckled
with
cold
uncaring
stars.

“Behold
the
king’s
justice,”
Lysa
Arryn
said.
Torch
flames
fluttered
like
pennons
along
the
walls,
and
here
and
there
the
odd
torch
guttered
out.

“Lysa,
I
think
this
unwise,”
Catelyn
Stark
said
as
the
black
wind
swirled
around
the
hall.

Her
sister
ignored
her.
“You
want
a
trial,
my
lord
of
Lannister.
Very
well,
a
trial
you
shall
have.
My
son
will
listen
to
whatever
you
care
to
say,
and
you
shall
hear
his
judgment.
Then
you
may
leave…
by
one
door
or
the
other.”

She
looked
so
pleased
with
herself,
Tyrion
thought,
and
small
wonder.
How
could
a
trial
threaten
her,
when
her
weakling
son
was
the
lord
judge?
Tyrion
glanced
at
her
Moon
Door.
Mother,
I
want
to
see
him
fly!
the
boy
had
said.
How
many
men
had
the
snot-nosed
little
wretch
sent
through
that
door
already?

“I
thank
you,
my
good
lady,
but
I
see
no
need
to
trouble
Lord
Robert,”
Tyrion
said
politely.
“The
gods
know
the
truth
of
my
innocence.
I
will
have
their
verdict,
not
the
judgment
of
men.
I
demand
trial
by
combat.”

A
storm
of
sudden
laughter
filled
the
High
Hall
of
the
Arryns.
Lord
Nestor
Royce
snorted,
Ser
Willis
chuckled,
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
guffawed,
and
others
threw
back
their
heads
and
howled
until
tears
ran
down
their
faces.
Marillion
clumsily
plucked
a
gay
note
on
his
new
woodharp
with
the
fingers
of
his
broken
hand.
Even
the
wind
seemed
to
whistle
with
derision
as
it
came
skirling
through
the
Moon
Door.

Lysa
Arryn’s
watery
blue
eyes
looked
uncertain.
He
had
caught
her
off
balance.
“You
have
that
right,
to
be
sure.”

The
young
knight
with
the
green
viper
embroidered
on
his
surcoat
stepped
forward
and
went
to
one
knee.
“My
lady,
I
beg
the
boon
of
championing
your
cause.”

“The
honor
should
be
mine,”
old
Lord
Hunter
said.
“For
the
love
I
bore
your
lord
husband,
let
me
avenge
his
death.”

“My
father
served
Lord
Jon
faithfully
as
High
Steward
of
the
Vale,”
Ser
Albar
Royce
boomed.
“Let
me
serve
his
son
in
this.”

“The
gods
favor
the
man
with
the
just
cause,”
said
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
“yet
often
that
turns
out
to
be
the
man
with
the
surest
sword.
We
all
know
who
that
is.”
He
smiled
modestly.

A
dozen
other
men
all
spoke
at
once,
clamoring
to
be
heard.
Tyrion
found
it
disheartening
to
realize
so
many
strangers
were
eager
to
kill
him.
Perhaps
this
had
not
been
such
a
clever
plan
after
all.

Lady
Lysa
raised
a
hand
for
silence.
“I
thank
you,
my
lords,
as
I
know
my
son
would
thank
you
if
he
were
among
us.
No
men
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
are
as
bold
and
true
as
the
knights
of
the
Vale.
Would
that
I
could
grant
you
all
this
honor.
Yet
I
can
choose
only
one.”
She
gestured.
“Ser
Vardis
Egen,
you
were
ever
my
lord
husband’s
good
right
hand.
You
shall
be
our
champion.”

Ser
Vardis
had
been
singularly
silent.
“My
lady,”
he
said
gravely,
sinking
to
one
knee,
“pray
give
this
burden
to
another,
I
have
no
taste
for
it.
The
man
is
no
warrior.
Look
at
him.
A
dwarf,
half
my
size
and
lame
in
the
legs.
It
would
be
shameful
to
slaughter
such
a
man
and
call
it
justice.”

Oh,
excellent,
Tyrion
thought.
“I
agree.”

Lysa
glared
at
him.
“You
demanded
a
trial
by
combat.”

“And
now
I
demand
a
champion,
such
as
you
have
chosen
for
yourself.
My
brother
Jaime
will
gladly
take
my
part,
I
know.”

“Your
precious
Kingslayer
is
hundreds
of
leagues
from
here,”
snapped
Lysa
Arryn.

“Send
a
bird
for
him.
I
will
gladly
await
his
arrival.”

“You
will
face
Ser
Vardis
on
the
morrow.”

“Singer,”
Tyrion
said,
turning
to
Marillion,
“when
you
make
a
ballad
of
this,
be
certain
you
tell
them
how
Lady
Arryn
denied
the
dwarf
the
right
to
a
champion,
and
sent
him
forth
lame
and
bruised
and
hobbling
to
face
her
finest
knight.”

“I
deny
you
nothing!”
Lysa
Arryn
said,
her
voice
peeved
and
shrill
with
irritation.
“Name
your
champion,
Imp…
if
you
think
you
can
find
a
man
to
die
for
you.”

“If
it
is
all
the
same
to
you,
I’d
sooner
find
one
to
kill
for
me.”
Tyrion
looked
over
the
long
hall.
No
one
moved.
For
a
long
moment
he
wondered
if
it
had
all
been
a
colossal
blunder.

Then
there
was
a
stirring
in
the
rear
of
the
chamber.
“I’ll
stand
for
the
dwarf,”
Bronn
called
out.





EDDARD

He
dreamt
an
old
dream,
of
three
knights
in
white
cloaks,
and
a
tower
long
fallen,
and
Lyanna
in
her
bed
of
blood.

In
the
dream
his
friends
rode
with
him,
as
they
had
in
life.
Proud
Martyn
Cassel,
Jory’s
father;
faithful
Theo
Wull;
Ethan
Glover,
who
had
been
Brandon’s
squire;
Ser
Mark
Ryswell,
soft
of
speech
and
gentle
of
heart;
the
crannogman,
Howland
Reed;
Lord
Dustin
on
his
great
red
stallion.
Ned
had
known
their
faces
as
well
as
he
knew
his
own
once,
but
the
years
leech
at
a
man’s
memories,
even
those
he
has
vowed
never
to
forget.
In
the
dream
they
were
only
shadows,
grey
wraiths
on
horses
made
of
mist.

They
were
seven,
facing
three.
In
the
dream
as
it
had
been
in
life.
Yet
these
were
no
ordinary
three.
They
waited
before
the
round
tower,
the
red
mountains
of
Dorne
at
their
backs,
their
white
cloaks
blowing
in
the
wind.
And
these
were
no
shadows;
their
faces
burned
clear,
even
now.
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning,
had
a
sad
smile
on
his
lips.
The
hilt
of
the
greatsword
Dawn
poked
up
over
his
right
shoulder.
Ser
Oswell
Whent
was
on
one
knee,
sharpening
his
blade
with
a
whetstone.
Across
his
white-enameled
helm,
the
black
bat
of
his
House
spread
its
wings.
Between
them
stood
fierce
old
Ser
Gerold
Hightower,
the
White
Bull,
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.

“I
looked
for
you
on
the
Trident,”
Ned
said
to
them.

“We
were
not
there,”
Ser
Gerold
answered.

“Woe
to
the
Usurper
if
we
had
been,”
said
Ser
Oswell.

“When
King’s
Landing
fell,
Ser
Jaime
slew
your
king
with
a
golden
sword,
and
I
wondered
where
you
were.”

“Far
away,”
Ser
Gerold
said,
“or
Aerys
would
yet
sit
the
Iron
Throne,
and
our
false
brother
would
burn
in
seven
hells.”

“I
came
down
on
Storm’s
End
to
lift
the
siege,”
Ned
told
them,
“and
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
dipped
their
banners,
and
all
their
knights
bent
the
knee
to
pledge
us
fealty.
I
was
certain
you
would
be
among
them.”

“Our
knees
do
not
bend
easily,”
said
Ser
Arthur
Dayne.

“Ser
Willem
Darry
is
fled
to
Dragonstone,
with
your
queen
and
Prince
Viserys.
I
thought
you
might
have
sailed
with
him.”

“Ser
Willem
is
a
good
man
and
true,”
said
Ser
Oswell.

“But
not
of
the
Kingsguard,”
Ser
Gerold
pointed
out.
“The
Kingsguard
does
not
flee.”

“Then
or
now,”
said
Ser
Arthur.
He
donned
his
helm.

“We
swore
a
vow,”
explained
old
Ser
Gerold.

Ned’s
wraiths
moved
up
beside
him,
with
shadow
swords
in
hand.
They
were
seven
against
three.

“And
now
it
begins,”
said
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
He
unsheathed
Dawn
and
held
it
with
both
hands.
The
blade
was
pale
as
milkglass,
alive
with
light.

“No,”
Ned
said
with
sadness
in
his
voice.
“Now
it
ends.”
As
they
came
together
in
a
rush
of
steel
and
shadow,
he
could
hear
Lyanna
screaming.
“Eddard!”
she
called.
A
storm
of
rose
petals
blew
across
a
blood-streaked
sky,
as
blue
as
the
eyes
of
death.

“Lord
Eddard,”
Lyanna
called
again.

“I
promise,”
he
whispered.
“Lya,
I
promise…”

“Lord
Eddard,”
a
man
echoed
from
the
dark.

Groaning,
Eddard
Stark
opened
his
eyes.
Moonlight
streamed
through
the
tall
windows
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

“Lord
Eddard?”
A
shadow
stood
over
the
bed.

“How…
how
long?”
The
sheets
were
tangled,
his
leg
splinted
and
plastered.
A
dull
throb
of
pain
shot
up
his
side.

“Six
days
and
seven
nights.”
The
voice
was
Vayon
Poole’s.
The
steward
held
a
cup
to
Ned’s
lips.
“Drink,
my
lord.”

“What…?”

“Only
water.
Maester
Pycelle
said
you
would
be
thirsty.”

Ned
drank.
His
lips
were
parched
and
cracked.
The
water
tasted
sweet
as
honey.

“The
king
left
orders,”
Vayon
Poole
told
him
when
the
cup
was
empty.
“He
would
speak
with
you,
my
lord.”

“On
the
morrow,”
Ned
said.
“When
I
am
stronger.”
He
could
not
face
Robert
now.
The
dream
had
left
him
weak
as
a
kitten.

“My
lord,”
Poole
said,
“he
commanded
us
to
send
you
to
him
the
moment
you
opened
your
eyes.”
The
steward
busied
himself
lighting
a
bedside
candle.

Ned
cursed
softly.
Robert
was
never
known
for
his
patience.
“Tell
him
I’m
too
weak
to
come
to
him.
If
he
wishes
to
speak
with
me,
I
should
be
pleased
to
receive
him
here.
I
hope
you
wake
him
from
a
sound
sleep.
And
summon…”
He
was
about
to
say
Jory
when
he
remembered.
“Summon
the
captain
of
my
guard.”

Alyn
stepped
into
the
bedchamber
a
few
moments
after
the
steward
had
taken
his
leave.
“My
lord.”

“Poole
tells
me
it
has
been
six
days,”
Ned
said.
“I
must
know
how
things
stand.”

“The
Kingslayer
is
fled
the
city,”
Alyn
told
him.
“The
talk
is
he’s
ridden
back
to
Casterly
Rock
to
join
his
father.
The
story
of
how
Lady
Catelyn
took
the
Imp
is
on
every
lip.
I
have
put
on
extra
guards,
if
it
please
you.”

“It
does,”
Ned
assured
him.
“My
daughters?”

“They
have
been
with
you
every
day,
my
lord.
Sansa
prays
quietly,
but
Arya…”
He
hesitated.
“She
has
not
said
a
word
since
they
brought
you
back.
She
is
a
fierce
little
thing,
my
lord.
I
have
never
seen
such
anger
in
a
girl.”

“Whatever
happens,”
Ned
said,
“I
want
my
daughters
kept
safe.
I
fear
this
is
only
the
beginning.”

“No
harm
will
come
to
them,
Lord
Eddard,”
Alyn
said.
“I
stake
my
life
on
that.”

“Jory
and
the
others…”

“I
gave
them
over
to
the
silent
sisters,
to
be
sent
north
to
Winterfell.
Jory
would
want
to
lie
beside
his
grandfather.”

It
would
have
to
be
his
grandfather,
for
Jory’s
father
was
buried
far
to
the
south.
Martyn
Cassel
had
perished
with
the
rest.
Ned
had
pulled
the
tower
down
afterward,
and
used
its
bloody
stones
to
build
eight
cairns
upon
the
ridge.
It
was
said
that
Rhaegar
had
named
that
place
the
tower
of
joy,
but
for
Ned
it
was
a
bitter
memory.
They
had
been
seven
against
three,
yet
only
two
had
lived
to
ride
away;
Eddard
Stark
himself
and
the
little
crannogman,
Howland
Reed.
He
did
not
think
it
omened
well
that
he
should
dream
that
dream
again
after
so
many
years.

“You’ve
done
well,
Alyn,”
Ned
was
saying
when
Vayon
Poole
returned.
The
steward
bowed
low.
“His
Grace
is
without,
my
lord,
and
the
queen
with
him.”

Ned
pushed
himself
up
higher,
wincing
as
his
leg
trembled
with
pain.
He
had
not
expected
Cersei
to
come.
It
did
not
bode
well
that
she
had.
“Send
them
in,
and
leave
us.
What
we
have
to
say
should
not
go
beyond
these
walls.”
Poole
withdrew
quietly.

Robert
had
taken
time
to
dress.
He
wore
a
black
velvet
doublet
with
the
crowned
stag
of
Baratheon
worked
upon
the
breast
in
golden
thread,
and
a
golden
mantle
with
a
cloak
of
black
and
gold
squares.
A
flagon
of
wine
was
in
his
hand,
his
face
already
flushed
from
drink.
Cersei
Lannister
entered
behind
him,
a
jeweled
tiara
in
her
hair.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
said.
“Your
pardons.
I
cannot
rise.”

“No
matter,”
the
king
said
gruffly.
“Some
wine?
From
the
Arbor.
A
good
vintage.”

“A
small
cup,”
Ned
said.
“My
head
is
still
heavy
from
the
milk
of
the
poppy.”

“A
man
in
your
place
should
count
himself
fortunate
that
his
head
is
still
on
his
shoulders,”
the
queen
declared.

“Quiet,
woman,”
Robert
snapped.
He
brought
Ned
a
cup
of
wine.
“Does
the
leg
still
pain
you?”

“Some,”
Ned
said.
His
head
was
swimming,
but
it
would
not
do
to
admit
to
weakness
in
front
of
the
queen.

“Pycelle
swears
it
will
heal
clean.”
Robert
frowned.
“I
take
it
you
know
what
Catelyn
has
done?”

“I
do.”
Ned
took
a
small
swallow
of
wine.
“My
lady
wife
is
blameless,
Your
Grace.
All
she
did
she
did
at
my
command.”

“I
am
not
pleased,
Ned,”
Robert
grumbled.

“By
what
right
do
you
dare
lay
hands
on
my
blood?”
Cersei
demanded.
“Who
do
you
think
you
are?”

“The
Hand
of
the
King,”
Ned
told
her
with
icy
courtesy.
“Charged
by
your
own
lord
husband
to
keep
the
king’s
peace
and
enforce
the
king’s
justice.”

“You
were
the
Hand,”
Cersei
began,
“but
now—”

“Silence!”
the
king
roared.
“You
asked
him
a
question
and
he
answered
it.”
Cersei
subsided,
cold
with
anger,
and
Robert
turned
back
to
Ned.
“Keep
the
king’s
peace,
you
say.
Is
this
how
you
keep
my
peace,
Ned?
Seven
men
are
dead…”

“Eight,”
the
queen
corrected.
“Tregar
died
this
morning,
of
the
blow
Lord
Stark
gave
him.”

“Abductions
on
the
kingsroad
and
drunken
slaughter
in
my
streets,”
the
king
said.
“I
will
not
have
it,
Ned.”

“Catelyn
had
good
reason
for
taking
the
Imp—”

“I
said,
I
will
not
have
it!
To
hell
with
her
reasons.
You
will
command
her
to
release
the
dwarf
at
once,
and
you
will
make
your
peace
with
Jaime.”

“Three
of
my
men
were
butchered
before
my
eyes,
because
Jaime
Lannister
wished
to
chasten
me.
Am
I
to
forget
that?”

“My
brother
was
not
the
cause
of
this
quarrel,”
Cersei
told
the
king.
“Lord
Stark
was
returning
drunk
from
a
brothel.
His
men
attacked
Jaime
and
his
guards,
even
as
his
wife
attacked
Tyrion
on
the
kingsroad.”

“You
know
me
better
than
that,
Robert,”
Ned
said.
“Ask
Lord
Baelish
if
you
doubt
me.
He
was
there.”

“I’ve
talked
to
Littlefinger,”
Robert
said.
“He
claims
he
rode
off
to
bring
the
gold
cloaks
before
the
fighting
began,
but
he
admits
you
were
returning
from
some
whorehouse.”

“Some
whorehouse?
Damn
your
eyes,
Robert,
I
went
there
to
have
a
look
at
your
daughter!
Her
mother
has
named
her
Barra.
She
looks
like
that
first
girl
you
fathered,
when
we
were
boys
together
in
the
Vale.”
He
watched
the
queen
as
he
spoke;
her
face
was
a
mask,
still
and
pale,
betraying
nothing.

Robert
flushed.
“Barra,”
he
grumbled.
“Is
that
supposed
to
please
me?
Damn
the
girl.
I
thought
she
had
more
sense.”

“She
cannot
be
more
than
fifteen,
and
a
whore,
and
you
thought
she
had
sense?”
Ned
said,
incredulous.
His
leg
was
beginning
to
pain
him
sorely.
It
was
hard
to
keep
his
temper.
“The
fool
child
is
in
love
with
you,
Robert.”

The
king
glanced
at
Cersei.
“This
is
no
fit
subject
for
the
queen’s
ears.”

“Her
Grace
will
have
no
liking
for
anything
I
have
to
say,”
Ned
replied.
“I
am
told
the
Kingslayer
has
fled
the
city.
Give
me
leave
to
bring
him
back
to
justice.”

The
king
swirled
the
wine
in
his
cup,
brooding.
He
took
a
swallow.
“No,”
he
said.
“I
want
no
more
of
this.
Jaime
slew
three
of
your
men,
and
you
five
of
his.
Now
it
ends.”

“Is
that
your
notion
of
justice?”
Ned
flared.
“If
so,
I
am
pleased
that
I
am
no
longer
your
Hand.”

The
queen
looked
to
her
husband.
“If
any
man
had
dared
speak
to
a
Targaryen
as
he
has
spoken
to
you—”

“Do
you
take
me
for
Aerys?”
Robert
interrupted.

“I
took
you
for
a
king.
Jaime
and
Tyrion
are
your
own
brothers,
by
all
the
laws
of
marriage
and
the
bonds
we
share.
The
Starks
have
driven
off
the
one
and
seized
the
other.
This
man
dishonors
you
with
every
breath
he
takes,
and
yet
you
stand
there
meekly,
asking
if
his
leg
pains
him
and
would
he
like
some
wine.”

Robert’s
face
was
dark
with
anger.
“How
many
times
must
I
tell
you
to
hold
your
tongue,
woman?”

Cersei’s
face
was
a
study
in
contempt.
“What
a
jape
the
gods
have
made
of
us
two,”
she
said.
“By
all
rights,
you
ought
to
be
in
skirts
and
me
in
mail.”

Purple
with
rage,
the
king
lashed
out,
a
vicious
backhand
blow
to
the
side
of
the
head.
She
stumbled
against
the
table
and
fell
hard,
yet
Cersei
Lannister
did
not
cry
out.
Her
slender
fingers
brushed
her
cheek,
where
the
pale
smooth
skin
was
already
reddening.
On
the
morrow
the
bruise
would
cover
half
her
face.
“I
shall
wear
this
as
a
badge
of
honor,”
she
announced.

“Wear
it
in
silence,
or
I’ll
honor
you
again,”
Robert
vowed.
He
shouted
for
a
guard.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
stepped
into
the
room,
tall
and
somber
in
his
white
armor.
“The
queen
is
tired.
See
her
to
her
bedchamber.”
The
knight
helped
Cersei
to
her
feet
and
led
her
out
without
a
word.

Robert
reached
for
the
flagon
and
refilled
his
cup.
“You
see
what
she
does
to
me,
Ned.”
The
king
seated
himself,
cradling
his
wine
cup.
“My
loving
wife.
The
mother
of
my
children.”
The
rage
was
gone
from
him
now;
in
his
eyes
Ned
saw
something
sad
and
scared.
“I
should
not
have
hit
her.
That
was
not…
that
was
not
kingly.”
He
stared
down
at
his
hands,
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
they
were.
“I
was
always
strong…
no
one
could
stand
before
me,
no
one.
How
do
you
fight
someone
if
you
can’t
hit
them?”
Confused,
the
king
shook
his
head.
“Rhaegar…
Rhaegar
won,
damn
him.
I
killed
him,
Ned,
I
drove
the
spike
right
through
that
black
armor
into
his
black
heart,
and
he
died
at
my
feet.
They
made
up
songs
about
it.
Yet
somehow
he
still
won.
He
has
Lyanna
now,
and
I
have
her.”
The
king
drained
his
cup.

“Your
Grace,”
Ned
Stark
said,
“we
must
talk…”

Robert
pressed
his
fingertips
against
his
temples.
“I
am
sick
unto
death
of
talk.
On
the
morrow
I’m
going
to
the
kingswood
to
hunt.
Whatever
you
have
to
say
can
wait
until
I
return.”

“If
the
gods
are
good,
I
shall
not
be
here
on
your
return.
You
commanded
me
to
return
to
Winterfell,
remember?”

Robert
stood
up,
grasping
one
of
the
bedposts
to
steady
himself.
“The
gods
are
seldom
good,
Ned.
Here,
this
is
yours.”
He
pulled
the
heavy
silver
hand
clasp
from
a
pocket
in
the
lining
of
his
cloak
and
tossed
it
on
the
bed.
“Like
it
or
not,
you
are
my
Hand,
damn
you.
I
forbid
you
to
leave.”

Ned
picked
up
the
silver
clasp.
He
was
being
given
no
choice,
it
seemed.
His
leg
throbbed,
and
he
felt
as
helpless
as
a
child.
“The
Targaryen
girl—”

The
king
groaned.
“Seven
hells,
don’t
start
with
her
again.
That’s
done,
I’ll
hear
no
more
of
it.”

“Why
would
you
want
me
as
your
Hand,
if
you
refuse
to
listen
to
my
counsel?”

“Why?”
Robert
laughed.
“Why
not?
Someone
has
to
rule
this
damnable
kingdom.
Put
on
the
badge,
Ned.
It
suits
you.
And
if
you
ever
throw
it
in
my
face
again,
I
swear
to
you,
I’ll
pin
the
damned
thing
on
Jaime
Lannister.”





CATELYN

The
eastern
sky
was
rose
and
gold
as
the
sun
broke
over
the
Vale
of
Arryn.
Catelyn
Stark
watched
the
light
spread,
her
hands
resting
on
the
delicate
carved
stone
of
the
balustrade
outside
her
window.
Below
her
the
world
turned
from
black
to
indigo
to
green
as
dawn
crept
across
fields
and
forests.
Pale
white
mists
rose
off
Alyssa’s
Tears,
where
the
ghost
waters
plunged
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
to
begin
their
long
tumble
down
the
face
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
Catelyn
could
feel
the
faint
touch
of
spray
on
her
face.

Alyssa
Arryn
had
seen
her
husband,
her
brothers,
and
all
her
children
slain,
and
yet
in
life
she
had
never
shed
a
tear.
So
in
death,
the
gods
had
decreed
that
she
would
know
no
rest
until
her
weeping
watered
the
black
earth
of
the
Vale,
where
the
men
she
had
loved
were
buried.
Alyssa
had
been
dead
six
thousand
years
now,
and
still
no
drop
of
the
torrent
had
ever
reached
the
valley
floor
far
below.
Catelyn
wondered
how
large
a
waterfall
her
own
tears
would
make
when
she
died.
“Tell
me
the
rest
of
it,”
she
said.

“The
Kingslayer
is
massing
a
host
at
Casterly
Rock,”
Ser
Rodrik
Cassel
answered
from
the
room
behind
her.
“Your
brother
writes
that
he
has
sent
riders
to
the
Rock,
demanding
that
Lord
Tywin
proclaim
his
intent,
but
he
has
had
no
answer.
Edmure
has
commanded
Lord
Vance
and
Lord
Piper
to
guard
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth.
He
vows
to
you
that
he
will
yield
no
foot
of
Tully
land
without
first
watering
it
with
Lannister
blood.”

Catelyn
turned
away
from
the
sunrise.
Its
beauty
did
little
to
lighten
her
mood;
it
seemed
cruel
for
a
day
to
dawn
so
fair
and
end
so
foul
as
this
one
promised
to.
“Edmure
has
sent
riders
and
made
vows,”
she
said,
“but
Edmure
is
not
the
Lord
of
Riverrun.
What
of
my
lord
father?”

“The
message
made
no
mention
of
Lord
Hoster,
my
lady.”
Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
They
had
grown
in
white
as
snow
and
bristly
as
a
thornbush
while
he
was
recovering
from
his
wounds;
he
looked
almost
himself
again.

“My
father
would
not
have
given
the
defense
of
Riverrun
over
to
Edmure
unless
he
was
very
sick,”
she
said,
worried.
“I
should
have
been
woken
as
soon
as
this
bird
arrived.”

“Your
lady
sister
thought
it
better
to
let
you
sleep,
Maester
Colemon
told
me.”

“I
should
have
been
woken,”
she
insisted.

“The
maester
tells
me
your
sister
planned
to
speak
with
you
after
the
combat,”
Ser
Rodrik
said.

“Then
she
still
plans
to
go
through
with
this
mummer’s
farce?”
Catelyn
grimaced.
“The
dwarf
has
played
her
like
a
set
of
pipes,
and
she
is
too
deaf
to
hear
the
tune.
Whatever
happens
this
morning,
Ser
Rodrik,
it
is
past
time
we
took
our
leave.
My
place
is
at
Winterfell
with
my
sons.
If
you
are
strong
enough
to
travel,
I
shall
ask
Lysa
for
an
escort
to
see
us
to
Gulltown.
We
can
take
ship
from
there.”

“Another
ship?”
Ser
Rodrik
looked
a
shade
green,
yet
he
managed
not
to
shudder.
“As
you
say,
my
lady.”

The
old
knight
waited
outside
her
door
as
Catelyn
summoned
the
servants
Lysa
had
given
her.
If
she
spoke
to
her
sister
before
the
duel,
perhaps
she
could
change
her
mind,
she
thought
as
they
dressed
her.
Lysa’s
policies
varied
with
her
moods,
and
her
moods
changed
hourly.
The
shy
girl
she
had
known
at
Riverrun
had
grown
into
a
woman
who
was
by
turns
proud,
fearful,
cruel,
dreamy,
reckless,
timid,
stubborn,
vain,
and,
above
all,
inconstant.

When
that
vile
turnkey
of
hers
had
come
crawling
to
tell
them
that
Tyrion
Lannister
wished
to
confess,
Catelyn
had
urged
Lysa
to
have
the
dwarf
brought
to
them
privately,
but
no,
nothing
would
do
but
that
her
sister
must
make
a
show
of
him
before
half
the
Vale.
And
now
this…

“Lannister
is
my
prisoner,”
she
told
Ser
Rodrik
as
they
descended
the
tower
stairs
and
made
their
way
through
the
Eyrie’s
cold
white
halls.
Catelyn
wore
plain
grey
wool
with
a
silvered
belt.
“My
sister
must
be
reminded
of
that.”

At
the
doors
to
Lysa’s
apartments,
they
met
her
uncle
storming
out.
“Going
to
join
the
fool’s
festival?”
Ser
Brynden
snapped.
“I’d
tell
you
to
slap
some
sense
into
your
sister,
if
I
thought
it
would
do
any
good,
but
you’d
only
bruise
your
hand.”

“There
was
a
bird
from
Riverrun,”
Catelyn
began,
“a
letter
from
Edmure…”

“I
know,
child.”
The
black
fish
that
fastened
his
cloak
was
Brynden’s
only
concession
to
ornament.
“I
had
to
hear
it
from
Maester
Colemon.
I
asked
your
sister
for
leave
to
take
a
thousand
seasoned
men
and
ride
for
Riverrun
with
all
haste.
Do
you
know
what
she
told
me?
The
Vale
cannot
spare
a
thousand
swords,
nor
even
one,
Uncle,
she
said.
You
are
the
Knight
of
the
Gate.
Your
place
is
here.”
A
gust
of
childish
laughter
drifted
through
the
open
doors
behind
him,
and
her
uncle
glanced
darkly
over
his
shoulder.
“Well,
I
told
her
she
could
bloody
well
find
herself
a
new
Knight
of
the
Gate.
Black
fish
or
no,
I
am
still
a
Tully.
I
shall
leave
for
Riverrun
by
evenfall.”

Catelyn
could
not
pretend
to
surprise.
“Alone?
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
you
will
never
survive
the
high
road.
Ser
Rodrik
and
I
are
returning
to
Winterfell.
Come
with
us,
Uncle.
I
will
give
you
your
thousand
men.
Riverrun
will
not
fight
alone.”

Brynden
thought
a
moment,
then
nodded
a
brusque
agreement.
“As
you
say.
It’s
the
long
way
home,
but
I’m
more
like
to
get
there.
I’ll
wait
for
you
below.”
He
went
striding
off,
his
cloak
swirling
behind
him.

Catelyn
exchanged
a
look
with
Ser
Rodrik.
They
went
through
the
doors
to
the
high,
nervous
sound
of
a
child’s
giggles.

Lysa’s
apartments
opened
over
a
small
garden,
a
circle
of
dirt
and
grass
planted
with
blue
flowers
and
ringed
on
all
sides
by
tall
white
towers.
The
builders
had
intended
it
as
a
godswood,
but
the
Eyrie
rested
on
the
hard
stone
of
the
mountain,
and
no
matter
how
much
soil
was
hauled
up
from
the
Vale,
they
>>>>>>> asd
could
not
get
a
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
grasp.
He
sank
again.

Sam
could
feel
the
cold
against
his
skin
as
the
water
soaked
through
his
clothes.
His
swordbelt
slipped
down
his
legs
and
tangled
round
his
ankles.
I’m
going
to
drown,
he
thought,
in
a
blind
black
panic.
He
thrashed,
trying
to
claw
his
way
back
to
the
surface,
but
instead
his
face
bumped
the
bottom
of
the
canal.
I’m
upside
down,
he
realized,
I’m
drowning.
Something
moved
beneath
one
flailing
hand,
an
eel
or
a
fish,
slithering
through
his
fingers.
I
can’t
drown,
Maester
Aemon
will
die
without
me,
and
Gilly
will
have
no
one.
I
have
to
swim,
I
have
to...

There
was
a
huge
splash,
and
something
coiled
around
him,
under
his
arms
and
around
his
chest.
The
eel,
was
his
first
thought,
the
eel
has
got
me,
it’s
going
to
pull
me
down.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
and
swallowed
more
water.
I’m
drowned,
was
his
last
thought.
Oh,
gods
be
good,
I’m
drowned.

When
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
on
his
back
and
a
big
black
Summer
Islander
was
pounding
on
his
belly
with
fists
the
size
of
hams.
Stop
that,
you’re
hurting
me,
Sam
tried
to
scream.
Instead
of
words
he
retched
out
water,
and
gasped.
He
was
sodden
and
shivering,
lying
on
the
cobbles
in
a
puddle
of
canal
water.
The
Summer
Islander
punched
him
in
the
belly
again,
and
more
water
came
squirting
out
his
nose.
“Stop
that,”
Sam
gasped.
“I
haven’t
drowned.
I
haven’t
drowned.”

“No.”
His
rescuer
leaned
over
him,
huge
and
black
and
dripping.
“You
owe
Xhondo
many
feathers.
The
water
ruined
Xhondo’s
fine
cloak.”

It
had,
Sam
saw.
The
feathered
cloak
clung
to
the
black
man’s
huge
shoulders,
sodden
and
soiled.
“I
never
meant...”

“...to
be
swimming?
Xhondo
saw.
Too
much
splashing.
Fat
men
should
float.”
He
grabbed
Sam’s
doublet
with
a
huge
black
fist
and
hauled
him
to
his
feet.
“Xhondo
mates
on
Cinnamon
Wind.
Many
tongues
he
speaks,
a
little.
Inside
Xhondo
laughs,
to
see
you
punch
the
singer.
And
Xhondo
hears.”
A
broad
white
smile
spread
across
his
face.
“Xhondo
knows
these
dragons.”





JAIME

“I
had
hoped
that
by
now
you
would
have
grown
tired
of
that
wretched
beard.
All
that
hair
makes
you
look
like
Robert.”
His
sister
had
put
aside
her
mourning
for
a
jade-green
gown
with
sleeves
of
silver
Myrish
lace.
An
emerald
the
size
of
a
pigeon’s
egg
hung
on
a
golden
chain
about
her
neck.

“Robert’s
beard
was
black.
Mine
is
gold.”

“Gold?
Or
silver?”
Cersei
plucked
a
hair
from
beneath
his
chin
and
held
it
up.
It
was
grey.
“All
the
color
is
draining
out
of
you,
brother.
You’ve
become
a
ghost
of
what
you
were,
a
pale
crippled
thing.
And
so
bloodless,
always
in
white.”
She
flicked
the
hair
away.
“I
prefer
you
garbed
in
crimson
and
gold.”

I
prefer
you
dappled
in
sunlight,
with
water
beading
on
your
naked
skin.
He
wanted
to
kiss
her,
carry
her
to
her
bedchamber,
throw
her
on
the
bed...
she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy...
“I
will
make
a
bargain
with
you.
Relieve
me
of
this
duty,
and
my
razor
is
yours
to
command.”

Her
mouth
tightened.
She
had
been
drinking
hot
spiced
wine
and
smelled
of
nutmeg.
“You
presume
to
dicker
with
me?
Need
I
remind
you,
you
are
sworn
to
obey.”

“I
am
sworn
to
protect
the
king.
My
place
is
at
his
side.”

“Your
place
is
wherever
he
sends
you.”

“Tommen
puts
his
seal
on
every
paper
that
you
put
in
front
of
him.
This
is
your
doing,
and
it’s
folly.
Why
name
Daven
your
Warden
of
the
West
if
you
have
no
faith
in
him?”

Cersei
took
a
seat
beneath
the
window.
Behind
her
Jaime
could
see
the
blackened
ruin
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.
“Why
so
reluctant,
ser?
Did
you
lose
your
courage
with
your
hand?”

“I
swore
an
oath
to
Lady
Stark,
never
again
to
take
up
arms
against
the
Starks
or
Tullys.”

“A
drunken
promise
made
with
a
sword
at
your
throat.”

“How
can
I
defend
Tommen
if
I
am
not
with
him?”

“By
defeating
his
enemies.
Father
always
said
that
a
swift
sword
stroke
is
a
better
defense
than
any
shield.
Admittedly,
most
sword
strokes
require
a
hand.
Still,
even
a
crippled
lion
may
inspire
fear.
I
want
Riverrun.
I
want
Brynden
Tully
chained
or
dead.
And
someone
needs
to
set
Harrenhal
to
rights.
We
have
urgent
need
of
Wylis
Manderly,
assuming
he
is
still
alive
and
captive,
but
the
garrison
has
not
replied
to
any
of
our
ravens.”

“Those
are
Gregor’s
men
at
Harrenhal,”
Jaime
reminded
her.
“The
Mountain
liked
them
cruel
and
stupid.
Most
like
they
ate
your
ravens,
messages
and
all.”

“That’s
why
I’m
sending
you.
They
may
eat
you
as
well,
brave
brother,
but
I
trust
you’ll
give
them
indigestion.”
Cersei
smoothed
her
skirt.
“I
want
Ser
Osmund
to
command
the
Kingsguard
in
your
absence.”

...she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...
“That’s
not
your
choice.
If
I
must
go,
Ser
Loras
will
command
here
in
my
stead.”

“Is
that
a
jape?
You
know
how
I
feel
about
Ser
Loras.”

“If
you
had
not
sent
Balon
Swann
to
Dorne—”

“I
need
him
there.
These
Dornishmen
cannot
be
trusted.
That
red
snake
championed
Tyrion,
have
you
forgotten
that?
I
will
not
leave
my
daughter
to
their
mercy.
And
I
will
not
have
Loras
Tyrell
commanding
the
Kingsguard.”

“Ser
Loras
is
thrice
the
man
Ser
Osmund
is.”

“Your
notions
of
manhood
have
changed
somewhat,
brother.”

Jaime
felt
his
anger
rising.
“True,
Loras
does
not
leer
at
your
teats
the
way
Ser
Osmund
does,
but
I
hardly
think—”

“Think
about
this.”
Cersei
slapped
his
face.

Jaime
made
no
attempt
to
block
the
blow.
“I
see
I
need
a
thicker
beard,
to
cushion
me
against
my
queen’s
caresses.”
He
wanted
to
rip
her
gown
off
and
turn
her
blows
to
kisses.
He’d
done
it
before,
back
when
he
had
two
good
hands.

The
queen’s
eyes
were
green
ice.
“You
had
best
go,
ser.”

...Lancel,
Osmund
Kettleblack,
and
Moon
Boy...

“Are
you
deaf
as
well
as
maimed?
You’ll
find
the
door
behind
you,
ser.”

“As
you
command.”
Jaime
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
her.

Somewhere
the
gods
were
laughing.
Cersei
had
never
taken
kindly
to
being
balked,
he
knew
that.
Softer
words
might
have
swayed
her,
yet
of
late
the
very
sight
of
her
made
him
angry.

Part
of
him
would
be
glad
to
put
King’s
Landing
behind
him.
He
had
no
taste
for
the
company
of
the
lickspittles
and
fools
who
surrounded
Cersei.
“The
smallest
council,”
they
were
calling
them
in
Flea
Bottom,
according
to
Addam
Marbrand.
And
Qyburn...
he
might
have
saved
Jaime’s
life,
but
he
was
still
a
Bloody
Mummer.
“Qyburn
stinks
of
secrets,”
he
warned
Cersei.
That
only
made
her
laugh.
“We
all
have
secrets,
brother,”
she
replied.

...she’s
been
fucking
Lancel
and
Osmund
Kettleblack
and
Moon
Boy
for
all
I
know...

Forty
knights
and
as
many
esquires
awaited
him
outside
the
Red
Keep’s
stables.
Half
were
westermen
sworn
to
House
Lannister,
the
others
recent
foes
turned
doubtful
friends.
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood
would
carry
Tommen’s
standard,
Red
Ronnet
Connington
the
white
banner
of
the
Kingsguard.
A
Paege,
a
Piper,
and
a
Peckledon
would
share
the
honor
of
squiring
for
the
Lord
Commander.
“Keep
friends
at
your
back
and
foes
where
you
can
see
them,”
Sumner
Crakehall
had
once
counseled
him.
Or
had
that
been
Father?

His
palfrey
was
a
blood
bay,
his
destrier
a
magnificent
grey
stallion.
It
had
been
long
years
since
Jaime
had
named
any
of
his
horses;
he
had
seen
too
many
die
in
battle,
and
that
was
harder
when
you
named
them.
But
when
the
Piper
boy
started
calling
them
Honor
and
Glory,
he
laughed
and
let
the
names
stand.
Glory
wore
trappings
of
Lannister
crimson;
Honor
was
barded
in
Kingsguard
white.
Josmyn
Peckledon
held
the
palfrey’s
reins
as
Ser
Jaime
mounted.
The
squire
was
skinny
as
a
spear,
with
long
arms
and
legs,
greasy
mouse-brown
hair,
and
cheeks
soft
with
peach
fuzz.
His
cloak
was
Lannister
crimson,
but
his
surcoat
showed
the
ten
purple
mullets
of
his
own
House
arrayed
upon
a
yellow
field.
“My
lord,”
the
lad
asked,
“will
you
be
wanting
your
new
hand?”

“Wear
it,
Jaime,”
urged
Ser
Kennos
of
Kayce.
“Wave
at
the
smallfolk
and
give
them
a
tale
to
tell
their
children.”

“I
think
not.”
Jaime
would
not
show
the
crowds
a
golden
lie.
Let
them
see
the
stump.
Let
them
see
the
cripple.
“But
feel
free
to
make
up
for
my
lack,
Ser
Kennos.
Wave
with
both
hands,
and
waggle
your
feet
if
it
please
you.”
He
gathered
the
reins
in
his
left
hand
and
wheeled
his
horse
around.
“Payne,”
he
called
as
the
rest
were
forming
up,
“you’ll
ride
beside
me.”

Ser
Ilyn
Payne
made
his
way
to
Jaime’s
side,
looking
like
the
beggar
at
the
ball.
His
ringmail
was
old
and
rusted,
worn
over
a
stained
jack
of
boiled
leather.
Neither
the
man
nor
his
mount
showed
any
heraldry;
his
shield
was
so
hacked
and
battered
it
was
hard
to
say
what
color
paint
might
once
have
covered
it.
With
his
grim
face
and
deep-sunk
hollow
eyes,
Ser
Ilyn
might
have
passed
for
death
himself...
as
he
had,
for
years.

No
longer,
though.
Ser
Ilyn
had
been
half
of
Jaime’s
price,
for
swallowing
his
boy
king’s
command
like
a
good
little
Lord
Commander.
The
other
half
had
been
Ser
Addam
Marbrand.
“I
need
them,”
he
had
told
his
sister,
and
Cersei
had
not
put
up
a
fight.
Most
like
she’s
pleased
to
rid
herself
of
them.
Ser
Addam
was
a
boyhood
friend
of
Jaime’s,
and
the
silent
headsman
had
belonged
to
their
father,
if
he
belonged
to
anyone.
Payne
had
been
the
captain
of
the
Hand’s
guard
when
he
had
been
heard
boasting
that
it
was
Lord
Tywin
who
ruled
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
told
King
Aerys
what
to
do.
Aerys
Targaryen
took
his
tongue
for
that.

“Open
the
gates,”
said
Jaime,
and
Strongboar,
in
his
booming
voice,
called
out,
“OPEN
THE
GATES!”

When
Mace
Tyrell
had
marched
out
through
the
Mud
Gate
to
the
sound
of
drums
and
fiddles,
thousands
lined
the
streets
to
cheer
him
off.
Little
boys
had
joined
the
march,
striding
along
beside
the
Tyrell
soldiers
with
heads
held
high
and
legs
pumping,
whilst
their
sisters
threw
down
kisses
from
the
windows.

Not
so
today.
A
few
whores
called
out
invitations
as
they
passed,
and
a
meat
pie
man
cried
his
wares.
In
Cobbler’s
Square
two
threadbare
sparrows
were
haranguing
several
hundred
smallfolk,
crying
doom
upon
the
heads
of
godless
men
and
demon
worshipers.
The
crowd
parted
for
the
column.
Sparrows
and
cobblers
alike
looked
on
with
dull
eyes.
“They
like
the
smell
of
roses
but
have
no
love
for
lions,”
Jaime
observed.
“My
sister
would
be
wise
to
take
note
of
that.”
Ser
Ilyn
made
no
reply.
The
perfect
companion
for
a
long
ride.
I
will
enjoy
his
conversation.

The
greater
part
of
his
command
awaited
him
beyond
the
city
walls;
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
with
his
outriders,
Ser
Steffon
Swyft
and
the
baggage
train,
the
Holy
Hundred
of
old
Ser
Bonifer
the
Good,
Sarsfield’s
mounted
archers,
Maester
Gulian
with
four
cages
full
of
ravens,
two
hundred
heavy
horse
under
Ser
Flement
Brax.
Not
a
great
host,
all
in
all;
fewer
than
a
thousand
men
in
total.
Numbers
were
the
last
thing
needed
at
Riverrun.
A
Lannister
army
already
invested
the
castle,
and
an
even
larger
force
of
Freys;
the
last
bird
they’d
received
suggested
that
the
besiegers
were
having
difficulty
keeping
themselves
fed.
Brynden
Tully
had
scoured
the
land
clean
before
retiring
behind
his
walls.

Not
that
it
required
much
scouring.
From
what
Jaime
had
seen
of
the
riverlands,
scarce
a
field
remained
unburnt,
a
town
unsacked,
a
maiden
undespoiled.
And
now
my
sweet
sister
sends
me
to
finish
the
work
that
Amory
Lorch
and
Gregor
Clegane
began.
It
left
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth.

This
near
to
King’s
Landing,
the
kingsroad
was
as
safe
as
any
road
could
be
in
such
times,
yet
Jaime
sent
Marbrand
and
his
outriders
ahead
to
scout.
“Robb
Stark
took
me
unawares
in
the
Whispering
Wood,”
he
said.
“That
will
never
happen
again.”

“You
have
my
word
on
it.”
Marbrand
seemed
visibly
relieved
to
be
ahorse
again,
wearing
the
smoke-grey
cloak
of
his
own
House
instead
of
the
gold
wool
of
the
City
Watch.
“If
any
foe
should
come
within
a
dozen
leagues,
you
will
know
of
them
beforehand.”

Jaime
had
given
stern
commands
that
no
man
was
to
depart
the
column
without
his
leave.
Elsewise,
he
knew
he
would
have
bored
young
lordlings
racing
through
the
fields,
scattering
livestock
and
trampling
down
the
crops.
There
were
still
cows
and
sheep
to
be
seen
near
the
city;
apples
on
the
trees
and
berries
in
the
brush,
stands
of
barleycorn
and
oats
and
winter
wheat,
wayns
and
oxcarts
on
the
road.
Farther
afield,
things
would
not
be
so
rosy.

Riding
at
the
front
of
the
host
with
Ser
Ilyn
silent
by
his
side,
Jaime
felt
almost
content.
The
sun
was
warm
on
his
back
and
the
wind
riffled
through
his
hair
like
a
woman’s
fingers.
When
Little
Lew
Piper
came
galloping
up
with
a
helm
full
of
blackberries,
Jaime
ate
a
handful
and
told
the
boy
to
share
the
rest
with
his
fellow
squires
and
Ser
Ilyn
Payne.

Payne
seemed
as
comfortable
in
his
silence
as
in
his
rusted
ringmail
and
boiled
leather.
The
clop
of
his
gelding’s
hooves
and
the
rattle
of
sword
in
scabbard
whenever
he
shifted
his
seat
were
the
only
sounds
he
made.
Though
his
pox-scarred
face
was
grim
and
his
eyes
as
cold
as
ice
on
a
winter
lake,
Jaime
sensed
that
he
was
glad
he’d
come.
I
gave
the
man
a
choice,
he
reminded
himself.
He
could
have
refused
me
and
remained
King’s
Justice.

Ser
Ilyn’s
appointment
had
been
a
wedding
gift
from
Robert
Baratheon
to
the
father
of
his
bride,
a
sinecure
to
compensate
Payne
for
the
tongue
he’d
lost
in
the
service
of
House
Lannister.
He
made
a
splendid
headsman.
He
had
never
botched
an
execution,
and
seldom
required
as
much
as
a
second
stroke.
And
there
was
something
about
his
silence
that
inspired
terror.
Seldom
had
a
King’s
Justice
seemed
so
well
fitted
for
his
office.

When
Jaime
decided
to
take
him,
he
had
sought
out
Ser
Ilyn’s
chambers
at
the
end
of
Traitor’s
Walk.
The
upper
floor
of
the
squat,
half-round
tower
was
divided
into
cells
for
prisoners
who
required
some
measure
of
comfort,
captive
knights
or
lordlings
awaiting
ransom
or
exchange.
The
entrance
to
the
dungeons
proper
was
at
ground
level,
behind
a
door
of
hammered
iron
and
a
second
of
splintery
grey
wood.
On
the
floors
between
were
rooms
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
Chief
Gaoler,
the
Lord
Confessor,
and
the
King’s
Justice.
The
Justice
was
a
headsman,
but
by
tradition
he
also
had
charge
of
the
dungeons
and
the
men
who
kept
them.

And
for
that
task,
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
was
singularly
ill
suited.
As
he
could
neither
read,
nor
write,
nor
speak,
Ser
Ilyn
had
left
the
running
of
the
dungeons
to
his
underlings,
such
as
they
were.
The
realm
had
not
had
a
Lord
Confessor
since
the
second
Daeron,
however,
and
the
last
Chief
Gaoler
had
been
a
cloth
merchant
who
purchased
the
office
from
Littlefinger
during
Robert’s
reign.
No
doubt
he’d
had
good
profit
from
it
for
a
few
years,
until
he
made
the
error
of
conspiring
with
some
other
rich
fools
to
give
the
Iron
Throne
to
Stannis.
They
called
themselves
“Antler
Men,”
so
Joff
had
nailed
antlers
to
their
heads
before
flinging
them
over
the
city
walls.
So
it
had
been
left
to
Rennifer
Longwaters,
the
head
undergaoler
with
the
twisted
back
who
claimed
at
tedious
length
to
have
a
“drop
of
dragon”
in
him,
to
unlock
the
dungeon
doors
for
Jaime
and
conduct
him
up
the
narrow
steps
inside
the
walls
to
the
place
where
Ilyn
Payne
had
lived
for
fifteen
years.

The
chambers
stank
of
rotted
food,
and
the
rushes
were
crawling
with
vermin.
As
Jaime
entered,
he
almost
trod
upon
a
rat.
Payne’s
greatsword
rested
on
a
trestle
table,
beside
a
whetstone
and
a
greasy
oilcloth.
The
steel
was
immaculate,
the
edge
glimmering
blue
in
the
pale
light,
but
elsewhere
piles
of
soiled
clothing
were
strewn
about
the
floors,
and
the
bits
of
mail
and
armor
scattered
here
and
there
were
red
with
rust.
Jaime
could
not
count
the
broken
wine
jars.
The
man
cares
for
naught
but
killing,
he
thought,
as
Ser
Ilyn
emerged
from
a
bedchamber
that
reeked
of
overflowing
chamber
pots.
“His
Grace
bids
me
win
back
his
riverlands,”
Jaime
told
him.
“I
would
have
you
with
me...
if
you
can
bear
to
give
up
all
of
this.”

Silence
was
his
answer,
and
a
long,
unblinking
stare.
But
just
as
he
was
about
to
turn
and
take
his
leave,
Payne
had
given
him
a
nod.
And
here
he
rides.
Jaime
glanced
at
his
companion.
Perhaps
there
is
yet
hope
for
the
both
of
us.

That
night
they
made
camp
beneath
the
hilltop
castle
of
the
Hayfords.
As
the
sun
went
down,
a
hundred
tents
sprouted
beneath
the
hill,
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
that
ran
beside
it.
Jaime
set
the
sentries
himself.
He
did
not
expect
trouble
this
close
to
the
city,
but
his
uncle
Stafford
had
once
thought
himself
safe
on
the
Oxcross
too.
It
was
best
to
take
no
chances.

When
the
invitation
came
down
from
the
castle
for
him
to
sup
with
Lady
Hayford’s
castellan,
Jaime
took
Ser
Ilyn
with
him,
along
with
Ser
Addam
Marbrand,
Ser
Bonifer
Hasty,
Red
Ronnet
Connington,
Strongboar,
and
a
dozen
other
knights
and
lordlings.
“I
suppose
I
ought
to
wear
the
hand,”
he
said
to
Peck
before
making
his
ascent.

The
lad
fetched
it
straightaway.
The
hand
was
wrought
of
gold,
very
lifelike,
with
inlaid
nails
of
mother-of-pearl,
its
fingers
and
thumb
half
closed
so
as
to
slip
around
a
goblet’s
stem.
I
cannot
fight,
but
I
can
drink,
Jaime
reflected
as
the
lad
was
tightening
the
straps
that
bound
it
to
his
stump.
“Men
shall
name
you
Goldenhand
from
this
day
forth,
my
lord,”
the
armorer
had
assured
him
the
first
time
he’d
fitted
it
onto
Jaime’s
wrist.
He
was
wrong.
I
shall
be
the
Kingslayer
till
I
die.

The
golden
hand
was
the
occasion
for
much
admiring
comment
over
supper,
at
least
until
Jaime
knocked
over
a
goblet
of
wine.
Then
his
temper
got
the
best
of
him.
“If
you
admire
the
bloody
thing
so
much,
lop
off
your
own
sword
hand
and
you
can
have
it,”
he
told
Flement
Brax.
After
that
there
was
no
more
talk
about
his
hand,
and
he
managed
to
drink
some
wine
in
peace.

The
lady
of
the
castle
was
a
Lannister
by
marriage,
a
plump
toddler
who
had
been
wed
to
his
cousin
Tyrek
before
she
was
a
year
old.
Lady
Ermesande
was
duly
trotted
out
for
their
approval,
all
trussed
up
in
a
little
gown
of
cloth-of-gold,
with
the
green
fretty
and
green
pale
wavy
of
House
Hayford
rendered
in
tiny
beads
of
jade.
But
soon
enough
the
girl
began
to
squall,
whereupon
she
was
promptly
whisked
off
to
bed
by
her
wet
nurse.

“Has
there
been
no
word
of
our
Lord
Tyrek?”
her
castellan
asked
as
a
course
of
trout
was
served.

“None.”
Tyrek
Lannister
had
vanished
during
the
riots
in
King’s
Landing
whilst
Jaime
himself
was
still
captive
at
Riverrun.
The
boy
would
be
fourteen
by
now,
assuming
he
was
still
alive.

“I
led
a
search
myself,
at
Lord
Tywin’s
command,”
offered
Addam
Marbrand
as
he
boned
his
fish,
“but
I
found
no
more
than
Bywater
had
before
me.
The
boy
was
last
seen
ahorse,
when
the
press
of
the
mob
broke
the
line
of
gold
cloaks.
Afterward...
well,
his
palfrey
was
found,
but
not
the
rider.
Most
like
they
pulled
him
down
and
slew
him.
But
if
that’s
so,
where
is
his
body?
The
mob
let
the
other
corpses
lie,
why
not
his?”

“He
would
be
of
more
value
alive,”
suggested
Strongboar.
“Any
Lannister
would
bring
a
hefty
ransom.”

“No
doubt,”
Marbrand
agreed,
“yet
no
ransom
demand
was
ever
made.
The
boy
is
simply
gone.”

“The
boy
is
dead.”
Jaime
had
drunk
three
cups
of
wine,
and
his
golden
hand
seemed
to
be
growing
heavier
and
clumsier
by
the
moment.
A
hook
would
serve
me
just
as
well.
“If
they
realized
whom
they’d
killed,
no
doubt
they
threw
him
in
the
river
for
fear
of
my
father’s
wrath.
They
know
the
taste
of
that
in
King’s
Landing.
Lord
Tywin
always
paid
his
debts.”

“Always,”
Strongboar
agreed,
and
that
was
the
end
of
that.

Yet
afterward,
alone
in
the
tower
room
he
had
been
offered
for
the
night,
Jaime
found
himself
wondering.
Tyrek
had
served
King
Robert
as
a
squire,
side
by
side
with
Lancel.
Knowledge
could
be
more
valuable
than
gold,
more
deadly
than
a
dagger.
It
was
Varys
he
thought
of
then,
smiling
and
smelling
of
lavender.
The
eunuch
had
agents
and
informers
all
over
the
city.
It
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
for
him
to
arrange
to
have
Tyrek
snatched
during
the
confusion...
provided
he
knew
beforehand
that
the
mob
was
like
to
riot.
And
Varys
knew
all,
or
so
he
would
have
us
believe.
Yet
he
gave
Cersei
no
warning
of
that
riot.
Nor
did
he
ride
down
to
the
ships
to
see
Myrcella
off.

He
opened
the
shutters.
The
night
was
growing
cold,
and
a
horned
moon
rode
the
sky.
His
hand
shone
dully
in
its
light.
No
good
for
throttling
eunuchs,
but
heavy
enough
to
smash
that
slimy
smile
into
a
fine
red
ruin.
He
wanted
to
hit
someone.

Jaime
found
Ser
Ilyn
honing
his
greatsword.
“It’s
time,”
he
told
the
man.
The
headsman
rose
and
followed,
his
cracked
leather
boots
scraping
against
the
steep
stone
steps
as
they
went
down
the
stair.
A
small
courtyard
opened
off
the
armory.
Jaime
found
two
shields
there,
two
halfhelms,
and
a
pair
of
blunted
tourney
swords.
He
offered
one
to
Payne
and
took
the
other
in
his
left
hand
as
he
slid
his
right
through
the
loops
of
the
shield.
His
golden
fingers
were
curved
enough
to
hook,
but
could
not
grasp,
so
his
hold
upon
the
shield
was
loose.
“You
were
a
knight
once,
ser,”
Jaime
said.
“So
was
I.
Let
us
see
what
we
are
now.”

Ser
Ilyn
raised
his
blade
in
reply,
and
Jaime
moved
at
once
to
the
attack.
Payne
was
as
rusty
as
his
ringmail,
and
not
so
strong
as
Brienne,
yet
he
met
every
cut
with
his
own
blade,
or
interposed
his
shield.
They
danced
beneath
the
horned
moon
as
the
blunted
swords
sang
their
steely
song.
The
silent
knight
was
content
to
let
Jaime
lead
the
dance
for
a
while,
but
finally
he
began
to
answer
stroke
for
stroke.
Once
he
shifted
to
the
attack,
he
caught
Jaime
on
the
thigh,
on
the
shoulder,
on
the
forearm.
Thrice
he
made
his
head
ring
with
cuts
to
the
helm.
One
slash
ripped
the
shield
off
his
right
arm,
and
almost
burst
the
straps
that
bound
his
golden
hand
to
his
stump.
By
the
time
they
lowered
their
swords
he
was
bruised
and
battered,
but
the
wine
had
burned
away
and
his
head
was
clear.
“We
will
dance
again,”
he
promised
Ser
Ilyn.
“On
the
morrow,
and
the
morrow.
Every
day
we’ll
dance,
till
I
am
as
good
with
my
left
hand
as
ever
I
was
with
the
right.”

Ser
Ilyn
opened
his
mouth
and
made
a
clacking
sound.
A
laugh,
Jaime
realized.
Something
twisted
in
his
gut.

Come
morning,
none
of
the
others
was
so
bold
as
to
make
mention
of
his
bruises.
Not
one
of
them
had
heard
the
sound
of
swordplay
in
the
night,
it
would
seem.
Yet
when
they
climbed
back
down
to
camp,
Little
Lew
Piper
voiced
the
question
the
knights
and
lordlings
dared
not
ask.
Jaime
grinned
at
him.
“They
have
lusty
wenches
in
House
Hayford.
These
are
love
bites,
lad.”

Another
bright
and
blustery
day
was
followed
by
a
cloudy
one,
then
three
days
of
rain.
Wind
and
water
made
no
matter.
The
column
kept
its
pace,
north
along
the
kingsroad,
and
each
night
Jaime
found
some
private
place
to
win
himself
more
love
bites.
They
fought
inside
a
stable
as
a
one-eyed
mule
looked
on,
and
in
the
cellar
of
an
inn
amongst
the
casks
of
wine
and
ale.
They
fought
in
the
blackened
shell
of
a
big
stone
barn,
on
a
wooded
island
in
a
shallow
stream,
and
in
an
open
field
as
the
rain
pattered
softly
against
their
helms
and
shields.

Jaime
made
excuses
for
his
nightly
forays,
but
he
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
think
that
they
were
believed.
Addam
Marbrand
knew
what
he
was
about,
surely,
and
some
of
his
other
captains
must
have
suspected.
But
no
one
spoke
of
it
in
his
hearing...
and
since
the
only
witness
lacked
a
tongue,
he
need
not
fear
anyone
learning
just
how
inept
a
swordsman
the
Kingslayer
had
become.

Soon
the
signs
of
war
could
be
seen
on
every
hand.
Weeds
and
thorns
and
brushy
trees
grew
high
as
a
horse’s
head
in
fields
where
autumn
wheat
should
be
ripening,
the
kingsroad
was
bereft
of
travelers,
and
wolves
ruled
the
weary
world
from
dusk
till
dawn.
Most
of
the
animals
were
wary
enough
to
keep
their
distance,
but
one
of
Marbrand’s
outriders
had
his
horse
run
off
and
killed
when
he
dismounted
for
a
piss.
“No
beast
would
be
so
bold,”
declared
Ser
Bonifer
the
Good,
of
the
stern
sad
face.
“These
are
demons
in
the
skins
of
wolves,
sent
to
chastise
us
for
our
sins.”

“This
must
have
been
an
uncommonly
sinful
horse,”
Jaime
said,
standing
over
what
remained
of
the
poor
animal.
He
gave
orders
for
the
rest
of
the
carcass
to
be
cut
apart
and
salted
down;
it
might
be
they
would
need
the
meat.

At
a
place
called
Sow’s
Horn
they
found
a
tough
old
knight
named
Ser
Roger
Hogg
squatting
stubbornly
in
his
towerhouse
with
six
men-at-arms,
four
crossbowmen,
and
a
score
of
peasants.
Ser
Roger
was
as
big
and
bristly
as
his
name
and
Ser
Kennos
suggested
that
he
might
be
some
lost
Crakehall,
since
their
sigil
was
a
brindled
boar.
Strongboar
seemed
to
believe
it
and
spent
an
earnest
hour
questioning
Ser
Roger
about
his
ancestors.

Jaime
was
more
interested
in
what
Hogg
had
to
say
of
wolves.
“We
had
some
trouble
with
a
band
of
them
white
star
wolves,”
the
old
knight
told
him.
“They
come
round
sniffing
after
you,
my
lord,
but
we
saw
them
off,
and
buried
three
down
by
the
turnips.
Before
them
there
was
a
pack
of
bloody
lions,
begging
your
pardon.
The
one
who
led
them
had
a
manticore
on
his
shield.”

“Ser
Amory
Lorch,”
Jaime
offered.
“My
lord
father
commanded
him
to
harry
the
riverlands.”

“Which
we’re
no
part
of,”
Ser
Roger
Hogg
said
stoutly.
“My
fealty’s
owed
to
House
Hayford,
and
Lady
Ermesande
bends
her
little
knee
at
King’s
Landing,
or
will
when
she’s
old
enough
to
walk.
I
told
him
that,
but
this
Lorch
wasn’t
much
for
listening.
He
slaughtered
half
my
sheep
and
three
good
milk
goats,
and
tried
to
roast
me
in
my
tower.
My
walls
are
solid
stone
and
eight
feet
thick,
though,
so
after
his
fire
burned
out
he
rode
off
bored.
The
wolves
come
later,
the
ones
on
four
legs.
They
ate
the
sheep
the
manticore
left
me.
I
got
a
few
good
pelts
in
recompense,
but
fur
don’t
fill
your
belly.
What
should
we
do,
my
lord?”

“Plant,”
said
Jaime,
“and
pray
for
one
last
harvest.”
It
was
not
a
hopeful
answer,
but
it
was
the
only
one
he
had.

The
next
day,
the
column
crossed
the
stream
that
formed
the
boundary
between
the
lands
that
did
fealty
to
King’s
Landing
and
those
beholden
to
Riverrun.
Maester
Gulian
consulted
a
map
and
announced
that
these
hills
were
held
by
the
brothers
Wode,
a
pair
of
landed
knights
sworn
to
Harrenhal...
but
their
halls
had
been
earth
and
timber,
and
only
blackened
beams
remained
of
them.

No
Wodes
appeared,
nor
any
of
their
smallfolk,
though
some
outlaws
had
taken
shelter
in
the
root
cellar
beneath
the
second
brother’s
keep.
One
of
them
wore
the
ruins
of
a
crimson
cloak,
but
Jaime
hanged
him
with
the
rest.
It
felt
good.
This
was
justice.
Make
a
habit
of
it,
Lannister,
and
one
day
men
might
call
you
Goldenhand
after
all.
Goldenhand
the
Just.

The
world
grew
ever
greyer
as
they
drew
near
to
Harrenhal.
They
rode
beneath
slate
skies,
beside
waters
that
shone
old
and
cold
as
a
sheet
of
beaten
steel.
Jaime
found
himself
wondering
if
Brienne
might
have
passed
this
way
before
him.
If
she
thought
that
Sansa
Stark
had
made
for
Riverrun...
Had
they
encountered
other
travelers,
he
might
have
stopped
to
ask
if
any
of
them
had
chance
to
see
a
pretty
maid
with
auburn
hair,
or
a
big
ugly
one
with
a
face
that
would
curdle
milk.
But
there
was
no
one
on
the
roads
but
wolves,
and
their
howling
held
no
answers.

Across
the
pewter
waters
of
the
lake
the
towers
of
Black
Harren’s
folly
appeared
at
last,
five
twisted
fingers
of
black,
misshapen
stone
grasping
for
the
sky.
Though
Littlefinger
had
been
named
the
Lord
of
Harrenhal,
he
seemed
in
no
great
haste
to
occupy
his
new
seat,
so
it
had
fallen
to
Jaime
Lannister
to
“sort
out”
Harrenhal
on
his
way
to
Riverrun.

That
it
needed
sorting
out
he
did
not
doubt.
Gregor
Clegane
had
wrested
the
immense,
gloomy
castle
away
from
the
Bloody
Mummers
before
Cersei
recalled
him
to
King’s
Landing.
No
doubt
the
Mountain’s
men
were
still
rattling
around
inside
like
so
many
dried
peas
in
a
suit
of
plate,
but
they
were
not
ideally
suited
to
restore
the
king’s
peace
to
the
Trident.
The
only
peace
Ser
Gregor’s
lot
had
ever
given
anyone
was
the
peace
of
the
grave.

Ser
Addam’s
outriders
had
reported
that
the
gates
of
Harrenhal
were
closed
and
barred.
Jaime
drew
his
men
up
before
them
and
commanded
Ser
Kennos
of
Kayce
to
sound
the
Horn
of
Herrock,
black
and
twisted
and
banded
in
old
gold.

When
three
blasts
had
echoed
off
the
walls,
they
heard
the
groan
of
iron
hinges
and
the
gates
swung
slowly
open.
So
thick
were
the
walls
of
Black
Harren’s
folly
that
Jaime
passed
beneath
a
dozen
murder
holes
before
emerging
into
sudden
sunlight
in
the
yard
where
he’d
bid
farewell
to
the
Bloody
Mummers,
not
so
long
ago.
Weeds
were
sprouting
from
the
hard-packed
earth,
and
flies
buzzed
about
the
carcass
of
a
horse.

A
handful
of
Ser
Gregor’s
men
emerged
from
the
towers
to
watch
him
dismount;
hard-eyed,
hard-mouthed
men,
the
lot
of
them.
They
would
have
to
be,
to
ride
beside
the
Mountain.
About
the
best
that
could
be
said
for
Gregor’s
men
was
that
they
were
not
quite
as
vile
and
violent
a
bunch
as
the
Brave
Companions.
“Fuck
me,
Jaime
Lannister,”
blurted
one
grey
and
grizzled
man-at-arms.
“It’s
the
bleeding
Kingslayer,
boys.
Fuck
me
with
a
spear!”

“Who
might
you
be?”
Jaime
asked.

“Ser
used
to
call
me
Shitmouth,
if
it
please
m’lord.”
He
spit
in
his
hands
and
wiped
his
cheeks
with
them,
as
if
that
would
somehow
make
him
more
presentable.

“Charming.
Do
you
command
here?”

“Me?
Shit,
no.
M’lord.
Bugger
me
with
a
bloody
spear.”
Shitmouth
had
enough
crumbs
in
his
beard
to
feed
the
garrison.
Jaime
had
to
laugh.
The
man
took
that
for
encouragement.
“Bugger
me
with
a
bloody
spear,”
he
said
again,
and
started
laughing
too.

“You
heard
the
man,”
Jaime
said
to
Ilyn
Payne.
“Find
a
nice
long
spear,
and
shove
it
up
his
arse.”

Ser
Ilyn
did
not
have
a
spear,
but
Beardless
Jon
Bettley
was
glad
to
toss
him
one.
Shitmouth’s
drunken
laughter
stopped
abruptly.
“You
keep
that
bloody
thing
away
from
me.”

“Make
up
your
mind,”
said
Jaime.
“Who
has
the
command
here?
Did
Ser
Gregor
name
a
castellan?”

“Polliver,”
another
man
said,
“only
the
Hound
killed
him,
m’lord.
Him
and
the
Tickler
both,
and
that
Sarsfield
boy.”

The
Hound
again.
“You
know
it
was
Sandor?
You
saw
him?”

“Not
us,
m’lord.
That
innkeep
told
us.”

“It
happened
at
the
crossroads
inn,
my
lord.”
The
speaker
was
a
younger
man
with
a
mop
of
sandy
hair.
He
wore
the
chain
of
coins
that
had
once
belonged
to
Vargo
Hoat;
coins
from
half
a
hundred
distant
cities,
silver
and
gold,
copper
and
bronze,
square
coins
and
round
coins,
triangles
and
rings
and
bits
of
bone.
“The
innkeep
swore
the
man
had
one
side
of
his
face
all
burned.
His
whores
told
the
same
tale.
Sandor
had
some
boy
with
him,
a
ragged
peasant
lad.
They
hacked
Polly
and
the
Tickler
to
bloody
bits
and
rode
off
down
the
Trident,
we
were
told.”

“Did
you
send
men
after
them?”

Shitmouth
frowned,
as
if
the
thought
were
painful.
“No,
m’lord.
Fuck
us
all,
we
never
did.”

“When
a
dog
goes
mad
you
cut
his
throat.”

“Well,”
the
man
said,
rubbing
his
mouth,
“I
never
much
liked
Polly,
that
shit,
and
the
dog,
he
were
Ser’s
brother,
so...”

“We’re
bad,
m’lord,”
broke
in
the
man
who
wore
the
coins,
“but
you’d
need
to
be
mad
to
face
the
Hound.”

Jaime
looked
him
over.
Bolder
than
the
rest,
and
not
as
drunk
as
Shitmouth.
“You
were
afraid
of
him.”

“I
wouldn’t
say
afraid,
m’lord.
I’d
say
we
was
leaving
him
for
our
betters.
Someone
like
Ser.
Or
you.”

Me,
when
I
had
two
hands.
Jaime
did
not
delude
himself.
Sandor
would
make
short
work
of
him
now.
“You
have
a
name?”

“Rafford,
if
it
pleases.
Most
call
me
Raff.”

“Raff,
gather
the
garrison
together
in
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths.
Your
captives
as
well.
I’ll
want
to
see
them.
Those
whores
from
the
crossroads
too.
Oh,
and
Hoat.
I
was
distraught
to
hear
that
he
had
died.
I’d
like
to
look
upon
his
head.”

When
they
brought
it
to
him,
he
found
that
the
Goat’s
lips
had
been
sliced
off,
along
with
his
ears
and
most
of
his
nose.
The
crows
had
supped
upon
his
eyes.
It
was
still
recognizably
Hoat,
however.
Jaime
would
have
known
his
beard
anywhere;
an
absurd
rope
of
hair
two
feet
long,
dangling
from
a
pointed
chin.
Elsewise,
only
a
few
leathery
strips
of
flesh
still
clung
to
the
Qohorik’s
skull.
“Where
is
the
rest
of
him?”
he
asked.

No
one
wanted
to
tell
him.
Finally,
Shitmouth
lowered
his
eyes,
and
muttered,
“Rotted,
ser.
And
et.”

“One
of
the
captives
was
always
begging
food,”
Rafford
admitted,
“so
Ser
said
to
give
him
roast
goat.
The
Qohorik
didn’t
have
much
meat
on
him,
though.
Ser
took
his
hands
and
feet
first,
then
his
arms
and
legs.”

“The
fat
bugger
got
most,
m’lord,”
Shitmouth
offered,
“but
Ser,
he
said
to
see
that
all
the
captives
had
a
taste.
And
Hoat
too,
his
own
self.
That
whoreson
’ud
slobber
when
we
fed
him,
and
the
grease’d
run
down
into
that
skinny
beard
o’
his.”

Father,
Jaime
thought,
your
dogs
have
both
gone
mad.
He
found
himself
remembering
tales
he
had
first
heard
as
a
child
at
Casterly
Rock,
of
mad
Lady
Lothston
who
bathed
in
tubs
of
blood
and
presided
over
feasts
of
human
flesh
within
these
very
walls.

Somehow
revenge
had
lost
its
savor.
“Take
this
and
throw
it
in
the
lake.”
Jaime
tossed
Hoat’s
head
to
Peck,
and
turned
to
address
the
garrison.
“Until
such
time
as
Lord
Petyr
arrives
to
claim
his
seat,
Ser
Bonifer
Hasty
shall
hold
Harrenhal
in
the
name
of
the
crown.
Those
of
you
who
wish
may
join
him,
if
he’ll
have
you.
The
rest
will
ride
with
me
to
Riverrun.”

The
Mountain’s
men
looked
at
one
another.
“We’re
owed,”
said
one.
“Ser
promised
us.
Rich
rewards,
he
said.”

“His
very
words,”
Shitmouth
agreed.
“Rich
rewards,
for
them
as
rides
with
me.”
A
dozen
others
began
to
yammer
their
assent.

Ser
Bonifer
raised
a
gloved
hand.
“Any
man
who
remains
with
me
shall
have
a
hide
of
land
to
work,
a
second
hide
when
he
takes
a
wife,
a
third
at
the
birth
of
his
first
child.”

“Land,
ser?”
Shitmouth
spat.
“Piss
on
that.
If
we
wanted
to
grub
in
the
bloody
dirt,
we
could
have
bloody
well
stayed
home,
begging
your
pardon,
ser.
Rich
rewards,
Ser
said.
Meaning
gold.”

“If
you
have
a
grievance,
go
to
King’s
Landing
and
take
it
up
with
my
sweet
sister.”
Jaime
turned
to
Rafford.
“I’ll
see
those
captives
now.
Starting
with
Ser
Wylis
Manderly.”

“He
the
fat
one?”
asked
Rafford.

“I
devoutly
hope
so.
And
tell
me
no
sad
stories
of
how
he
died,
or
the
lot
of
you
are
apt
to
do
the
same.”

Any
hopes
he
might
have
nursed
of
finding
Shagwell,
Pyg,
or
Zollo
languishing
in
the
dungeons
were
sadly
disappointed.
The
Brave
Companions
had
abandoned
Vargo
Hoat
to
a
man,
it
would
seem.
Of
Lady
Whent’s
people,
only
three
remained—the
cook
who
had
opened
the
postern
gate
for
Ser
Gregor,
a
bent-back
armorer
called
Ben
Blackthumb,
and
a
girl
named
Pia,
who
was
not
near
as
pretty
as
she
had
been
when
Jaime
saw
her
last.
Someone
had
broken
her
nose
and
knocked
out
half
her
teeth.
The
girl
fell
at
Jaime’s
feet
when
she
saw
him,
sobbing
and
clinging
to
his
leg
with
hysterical
strength
till
Strongboar
pulled
her
off.
“No
one
will
hurt
you
now,”
he
told
her,
but
that
only
made
her
sob
the
louder.

The
other
captives
had
been
better
treated.
Ser
Wylis
Manderly
was
amongst
them,
along
with
several
other
highborn
northmen
taken
prisoner
by
the
Mountain
That
Rides
in
the
fighting
at
the
fords
of
the
Trident.
Useful
hostages,
all
worth
a
goodly
ransom.
They
were
ragged,
filthy,
and
shaggy
to
a
man,
and
some
had
fresh
bruises,
cracked
teeth,
and
missing
fingers,
but
their
wounds
had
been
washed
and
bandaged,
and
none
of
them
had
gone
hungry.
Jaime
wondered
if
they
had
any
inkling
what
they’d
been
eating,
and
decided
it
was
better
not
to
inquire.

None
had
any
defiance
left;
especially
not
Ser
Wylis,
a
bushy-faced
tub
of
suet
with
dull
eyes
and
sallow,
sagging
jowls.
When
Jaime
told
him
that
he
would
be
escorted
to
Maidenpool
and
there
put
on
a
ship
for
White
Harbor,
Ser
Wylis
collapsed
into
a
puddle
on
the
floor
and
sobbed
longer
and
louder
than
Pia
had.
It
took
four
men
to
lift
him
back
onto
his
feet.
Too
much
roast
goat,
Jaime
reflected.
Gods,
but
I
hate
this
bloody
castle.
Harrenhal
had
seen
more
horror
in
its
three
hundred
years
than
Casterly
Rock
had
witnessed
in
three
thousand.

Jaime
commanded
that
fires
be
lit
in
the
Hall
of
a
Hundred
Hearths
and
sent
the
cook
hobbling
back
to
the
kitchens
to
prepare
a
hot
meal
for
the
men
of
his
column.
“Anything
but
goat.”

He
took
his
own
supper
in
Hunter’s
Hall
with
Ser
Bonifer
Hasty,
a
solemn
stork
of
a
man
prone
to
salting
his
speech
with
appeals
to
the
Seven.
“I
want
none
of
Ser
Gregor’s
followers,”
he
declared
as
he
was
cutting
up
a
pear
as
withered
as
he
was,
so
as
to
make
certain
that
its
nonexistent
juice
did
not
stain
his
pristine
purple
doublet,
embroidered
with
the
white
bend
cotised
of
his
House.
“I
will
not
have
such
sinners
in
my
service.”

“My
septon
used
to
say
all
men
were
sinners.”

“He
was
not
wrong,”
Ser
Bonifer
allowed,
“but
some
sins
are
blacker
than
others,
and
fouler
in
the
nostrils
of
the
Seven.”

And
you
have
no
more
nose
than
my
little
brother,
or
my
own
sins
would
have
you
choking
on
that
pear.
“Very
well.
I’ll
take
Gregor’s
lot
off
your
hands.”
He
could
always
find
a
use
for
fighters.
If
nothing
else,
he
could
send
them
up
the
ladders
first,
should
he
need
to
storm
the
walls
of
Riverrun.

“Take
the
whore
as
well,”
Ser
Bonifer
urged.
“You
know
the
one.
The
girl
from
the
dungeons.”

“Pia.”
The
last
time
he
had
been
here,
Qyburn
had
sent
the
girl
to
his
bed,
thinking
that
would
please
him.
But
the
Pia
they
had
brought
up
from
the
dungeons
was
a
different
creature
from
the
sweet,
simple,
giggly
creature
who’d
crawled
beneath
his
blankets.
She
had
made
the
mistake
of
speaking
when
Ser
Gregor
wanted
quiet,
so
the
Mountain
had
smashed
her
teeth
to
splinters
with
a
mailed
fist
and
broken
her
pretty
little
nose
as
well.
He
would
have
done
worse,
no
doubt,
if
Cersei
had
not
called
him
down
to
King’s
Landing
to
face
the
Red
Viper’s
spear.
Jaime
would
not
mourn
him.
“Pia
was
born
in
this
castle,”
he
told
Ser
Bonifer.
“It
is
the
only
home
she
has
ever
known.”

“She
is
a
font
of
corruption,”
said
Ser
Bonifer.
“I
won’t
have
her
near
my
men,
flaunting
her...
parts.”

“I
expect
her
flaunting
days
are
done,”
he
said,
“but
if
you
find
her
that
objectionable,
I’ll
take
her.”
He
could
make
her
a
washerwoman,
he
supposed.
His
squires
did
not
mind
raising
his
tent,
grooming
his
horse,
or
cleaning
his
armor,
but
the
task
of
caring
for
his
clothes
struck
them
as
unmanly.
“Can
you
hold
Harrenhal
with
just
your
Holy
Hundred?”
Jaime
asked.
They
should
actually
be
called
the
Holy
Eighty-Six,
having
lost
fourteen
men
upon
the
Blackwater,
but
no
doubt
Ser
Bonifer
would
fill
up
his
ranks
again
as
soon
as
he
found
some
sufficiently
pious
recruits.

“I
anticipate
no
difficulty.
The
Crone
will
light
our
way,
and
the
Warrior
will
give
strength
to
our
arms.”

Or
else
the
Stranger
will
turn
up
for
the
whole
holy
lot
of
you.
Jaime
could
not
be
certain
who
had
convinced
his
sister
that
Ser
Bonifer
should
be
named
castellan
of
Harrenhal,
but
the
appointment
smelled
of
Orton
Merryweather.
Hasty
had
once
served
Merryweather’s
grandsire,
he
seemed
to
recall
dimly.
And
the
carrot-haired
justiciar
was
just
the
sort
of
simpleminded
fool
to
assume
that
someone
called
“the
Good”
was
the
very
potion
the
riverlands
required
to
heal
the
wounds
left
by
Roose
Bolton,
Vargo
Hoat,
and
Gregor
Clegane.

But
he
might
not
be
wrong.
Hasty
hailed
from
the
stormlands,
so
had
neither
friends
nor
foes
along
the
Trident;
no
blood
feuds,
no
debts
to
pay,
no
cronies
to
reward.
He
was
sober,
just,
and
dutiful,
and
his
Holy
Eighty-Six
were
as
well
disciplined
as
any
soldiers
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
made
a
lovely
sight
as
they
wheeled
and
pranced
their
tall
grey
geldings.
Littlefinger
had
once
quipped
that
Ser
Bonifer
must
have
gelded
the
riders
too,
so
spotless
was
their
repute.

All
the
same,
Jaime
wondered
about
any
soldiers
who
were
better
known
for
their
lovely
horses
than
for
the
foes
they’d
slain.
They
pray
well,
I
suppose,
but
can
they
fight?
They
had
not
disgraced
themselves
on
the
Blackwater,
so
far
as
he
knew,
but
they
had
not
distinguished
themselves
either.
Ser
Bonifer
himself
had
been
a
promising
knight
in
his
youth,
but
something
had
happened
to
him,
a
defeat
or
a
disgrace
or
a
near
brush
with
death,
and
afterward
he
had
decided
that
jousting
was
an
empty
vanity
and
put
away
his
lance
for
good
and
all.

Harrenhal
must
be
held,
though,
and
Baelor
Butthole
here
is
the
man
that
Cersei
chose
to
hold
it.
“This
castle
has
an
ill
repute,”
he
warned
him,
“and
one
that’s
well
deserved.
It’s
said
that
Harren
and
his
sons
still
walk
the
halls
by
night,
afire.
Those
who
look
upon
them
burst
into
flame.”

“I
fear
no
shade,
ser.
It
is
written
in
The
Seven-Pointed
Star
that
spirits,
wights,
and
revenants
cannot
harm
a
pious
man,
so
long
as
he
is
armored
in
his
faith.”

“Then
armor
yourself
in
faith,
by
all
means,
but
wear
a
suit
of
mail
and
plate
as
well.
Every
man
who
holds
this
castle
seems
to
come
to
a
bad
end.
The
Mountain,
the
Goat,
even
my
father...”

“If
you
will
forgive
my
saying
so,
they
were
not
godly
men,
as
we
are.
The
Warrior
defends
us,
and
help
is
always
near,
if
some
dread
foe
should
threaten.
Maester
Gulian
will
be
remaining
with
his
ravens,
Lord
Lancel
is
nearby
at
Darry
with
his
garrison,
and
Lord
Randyll
holds
Maidenpool.
Together
we
three
shall
hunt
down
and
destroy
whatever
outlaws
prowl
these
parts.
Once
that
is
done,
the
Seven
will
guide
the
goodfolk
back
to
their
villages
to
plow
and
plant
and
build
anew.”

The
ones
the
Goat
didn’t
kill,
at
least.
Jaime
hooked
his
golden
fingers
round
the
stem
of
his
wine
goblet.
“If
any
of
Hoat’s
Brave
Companions
fall
into
your
hands,
send
word
to
me
at
once.”
The
Stranger
might
have
made
off
with
the
Goat
before
Jaime
could
get
around
to
him,
but
fat
Zollo
was
still
out
there,
with
Shagwell,
Rorge,
Faithful
Urswyck,
and
the
rest.

“So
you
can
torture
them
and
kill
them?”

“I
suppose
you
would
forgive
them,
in
my
place?”

“If
they
made
sincere
repentance
for
their
sins...
yes,
I
would
embrace
them
all
as
brothers
and
pray
with
them
before
I
sent
them
to
the
block.
Sins
may
be
forgiven.
Crimes
require
punishment.”
Hasty
folded
his
hands
before
him
like
a
steeple,
in
a
way
that
reminded
Jaime
uncomfortably
of
his
father.
“If
it
is
Sandor
Clegane
that
we
encounter,
what
would
you
have
me
do?”

Pray
hard,
Jaime
thought,
and
run.
“Send
him
to
join
his
beloved
brother
and
be
glad
the
gods
made
seven
hells.
One
would
never
be
enough
to
hold
both
of
the
Cleganes.”
He
pushed
himself
awkwardly
to
his
feet.
“Beric
Dondarrion
is
a
different
matter.
Should
you
capture
him,
hold
him
for
my
return.
I’ll
want
to
march
him
back
to
King’s
Landing
with
a
rope
about
his
neck,
and
have
Ser
Ilyn
take
his
head
off
where
half
the
realm
can
see.”

“And
this
Myrish
priest
who
runs
with
him?
It
is
said
he
spreads
his
false
faith
everywhere.”

“Kill
him,
kiss
him,
or
pray
with
him,
as
you
please.”

“I
have
no
wish
to
kiss
the
man,
my
lord.”

“No
doubt
he’d
say
the
same
of
you.”
Jaime’s
smile
turned
into
a
yawn.
“My
pardons.
I
shall
take
my
leave
of
you,
if
you
have
no
objections.”

“None,
my
lord,”
said
Hasty.
No
doubt
he
wished
to
pray.

Jaime
wished
to
fight.
He
took
the
steps
two
at
a
time,
out
to
where
the
night
air
was
cold
and
crisp.
In
the
torchlit
yard
Strongboar
and
Ser
Flement
Brax
were
having
at
each
other
whilst
a
ring
of
men-at-arms
cheered
them
on.
Ser
Lyle
will
have
the
best
of
that
one,
he
knew.
I
need
to
find
Ser
Ilyn.
His
fingers
had
the
itch
again.
His
footsteps
took
him
away
from
the
noise
and
the
light.
He
passed
beneath
the
covered
bridge
and
through
the
Flowstone
Yard
before
he
realized
where
he
was
headed.

As
he
neared
the
bear
pit,
he
saw
the
glow
of
a
lantern,
its
pale
wintry
light
washing
over
the
tiers
of
steep
stone
seats.
Someone
has
come
before
me,
it
would
seem.
The
pit
would
be
a
fine
place
to
dance;
perhaps
Ser
Ilyn
had
anticipated
him.

But
the
knight
standing
over
the
pit
was
bigger;
a
husky,
bearded
man
in
a
red-and-white
surcoat
adorned
with
griffins.
Connington.
What’s
he
doing
here?
Below,
the
carcass
of
the
bear
still
sprawled
upon
the
sands,
though
only
bones
and
ragged
fur
remained,
half-buried.
Jaime
felt
a
pang
of
pity
for
the
beast.
At
least
he
died
in
battle.
“Ser
Ronnet,”
he
called,
“have
you
lost
your
way?
It
is
a
large
castle,
I
know.”

Red
Ronnet
raised
his
lantern.
“I
wished
to
see
where
the
bear
danced
with
the
maiden
not-so-fair.”
His
beard
shone
in
the
light
as
if
it
were
afire.
Jaime
could
smell
wine
on
his
breath.
“Is
it
true
the
wench
fought
naked?”

“Naked?
No.”
He
wondered
how
that
wrinkle
had
been
added
to
the
story.
“The
Mummers
put
her
in
a
pink
silk
gown
and
shoved
a
tourney
sword
into
her
hand.
The
Goat
wanted
her
death
to
be
amuthing.
Elsewise...”

“...the
sight
of
Brienne
naked
might
have
made
the
bear
flee
in
terror.”
Connington
laughed.

Jaime
did
not.
“You
speak
as
if
you
know
the
lady.”

“I
was
betrothed
to
her.”

That
took
him
by
surprise.
Brienne
had
never
mentioned
a
betrothal.
“Her
father
made
a
match
for
her...”

“Thrice,”
said
Connington.
“I
was
the
second.
My
father’s
notion.
I
had
heard
the
wench
was
ugly,
and
I
told
him
so,
but
he
said
all
women
were
the
same
once
you
blew
the
candle
out.”

“Your
father.”
Jaime
eyed
Red
Ronnet’s
surcoat,
where
two
griffins
faced
each
other
on
a
field
of
red
and
white.
Dancing
griffins.
“Our
late
Hand’s...
brother,
was
he?”

“Cousin.
Lord
Jon
had
no
brothers.”

“No.”
It
all
came
back
to
him.
Jon
Connington
had
been
Prince
Rhaegar’s
friend.
When
Merryweather
failed
so
dismally
to
contain
Robert’s
Rebellion
and
Prince
Rhaegar
could
not
be
found,
Aerys
had
turned
to
the
next
best
thing,
and
raised
Connington
to
the
Handship.
But
the
Mad
King
was
always
chopping
off
his
Hands.
He
had
chopped
Lord
Jon
after
the
Battle
of
the
Bells,
stripping
him
of
honors,
lands,
and
wealth,
and
packing
him
off
across
the
sea
to
die
in
exile,
where
he
soon
drank
himself
to
death.
The
cousin,
though—Red
Ronnet’s
father—had
joined
the
rebellion
and
been
rewarded
with
Griffin’s
Roost
after
the
Trident.
He
only
got
the
castle,
though;
Robert
kept
the
gold,
and
bestowed
the
greater
part
of
the
Connington
lands
on
more
fervent
supporters.

Ser
Ronnet
was
a
landed
knight,
no
more.
For
any
such,
the
Maid
of
Tarth
would
have
been
a
sweet
plum
indeed.
“How
is
it
that
you
did
not
wed?”
Jaime
asked
him.

“Why,
I
went
to
Tarth
and
saw
her.
I
had
six
years
on
her,
yet
the
wench
could
look
me
in
the
eye.
She
was
a
sow
in
silk,
though
most
sows
have
bigger
teats.
When
she
tried
to
talk
she
almost
choked
on
her
own
tongue.
I
gave
her
a
rose
and
told
her
it
was
all
that
she
would
ever
have
from
me.”
Connington
glanced
into
the
pit.
“The
bear
was
less
hairy
than
that
freak,
I’ll—”

Jaime’s
golden
hand
cracked
him
across
the
mouth
so
hard
the
other
knight
went
stumbling
down
the
steps.
His
lantern
fell
and
smashed,
and
the
oil
spread
out,
burning.
“You
are
speaking
of
a
highborn
lady,
ser.
Call
her
by
her
name.
Call
her
Brienne.”

Connington
edged
away
from
the
spreading
flames
on
his
hands
and
knees.
“Brienne.
If
it
please
my
lord.”
He
spat
a
glob
of
blood
at
Jaime’s
foot.
“Brienne
the
Beauty.”





CERSEI

It
was
a
slow
climb
to
the
top
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
As
the
horses
labored
upward,
the
queen
leaned
back
against
a
plump
red
cushion.
From
outside
came
the
voice
of
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack.
“Make
way.
Clear
the
street.
Make
way
for
Her
Grace
the
queen.”

“Margaery
does
keep
a
lively
court,”
Lady
Merryweather
was
saying.
“We
have
jugglers,
mummers,
poets,
puppets...”

“Singers?”
prompted
Cersei.

“Many
and
more,
Your
Grace.
Hamish
the
Harper
plays
for
her
once
a
fortnight,
and
sometimes
Alaric
of
Eysen
will
entertain
us
of
an
evening,
but
the
Blue
Bard
is
her
favorite.”

Cersei
recalled
the
bard
from
Tommen’s
wedding.
Young,
and
fair
to
look
upon.
Could
there
be
something
there?
“There
are
other
men
as
well,
I
hear.
Knights
and
courtiers.
Admirers.
Tell
me
true,
my
lady.
Do
you
think
Margaery
is
still
a
maiden?”

“She
says
she
is,
Your
Grace.”

“So
she
does.
What
do
you
say?”

Taena’s
black
eyes
sparkled
with
mischief.
“When
she
wed
Lord
Renly
at
Highgarden,
I
helped
disrobe
him
for
the
bedding.
His
lordship
was
a
well-made
man,
and
lusty.
I
saw
the
proof
when
we
tumbled
him
into
the
wedding
bed
where
his
bride
awaited
him
as
naked
as
her
name
day,
blushing
prettily
beneath
the
coverlets.
Ser
Loras
had
carried
her
up
the
steps
himself.
Margaery
may
say
that
the
marriage
was
never
consummated,
that
Lord
Renly
had
drunk
too
much
wine
at
the
wedding
feast,
but
I
promise
you,
the
bit
between
his
legs
was
anything
but
weary
when
last
I
saw
it.”

“Did
you
chance
to
see
the
marriage
bed
the
morning
after?”
Cersei
asked.
“Did
she
bleed?”

“No
sheet
was
shown,
Your
Grace.”

A
pity.
Still,
the
absence
of
a
bloody
sheet
meant
little,
by
itself.
Common
peasant
girls
bled
like
pigs
upon
their
wedding
nights,
she
had
heard,
but
that
was
less
true
of
highborn
maids
like
Margaery
Tyrell.
A
lord’s
daughter
was
more
like
to
give
her
maidenhead
to
a
horse
than
a
husband,
it
was
said,
and
Margaery
had
been
riding
since
she
was
old
enough
to
walk.
“I
understand
the
little
queen
has
many
admirers
amongst
our
household
knights.
The
Redwyne
twins,
Ser
Tallad...
who
else,
pray
tell?”

Lady
Merryweather
gave
a
shrug.
“Ser
Lambert,
the
fool
who
hides
a
good
eye
behind
a
patch.
Bayard
Norcross.
Courtenay
Greenhill.
The
brothers
Woodwright,
sometimes
Portifer
and
often
Lucantine.
Oh,
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
is
a
frequent
visitor.”

“Pycelle?
Truly?”
Had
that
doddering
old
worm
forsaken
the
lion
for
the
rose?
If
so,
he
will
regret
it.
“Who
else?”

“The
Summer
Islander
in
his
feathered
cloak.
How
could
I
have
forgotten
him,
with
his
skin
as
black
as
ink?
Others
come
to
pay
court
to
her
cousins.
Elinor
is
promised
to
the
Ambrose
boy,
but
loves
to
flirt,
and
Megga
has
a
new
suitor
every
fortnight.
Once
she
kissed
a
potboy
in
the
kitchen.
I
have
heard
talk
of
her
marrying
Lady
Bulwer’s
brother,
but
if
Megga
were
to
choose
for
herself,
she
would
sooner
have
Mark
Mullendore,
I
am
certain.”

Cersei
laughed.
“The
butterfly
knight
who
lost
his
arm
on
the
Blackwater?
What
good
is
half
a
man?”

“Megga
thinks
him
sweet.
She
has
asked
Lady
Margaery
to
help
her
find
a
monkey
for
him.”

“A
monkey.”
The
queen
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that.
Sparrows
and
monkeys.
Truly,
the
realm
is
going
mad.
“What
of
our
brave
Ser
Loras?
How
often
does
he
call
upon
his
sister?”

“More
than
any
of
the
others.”
When
Taena
frowned,
a
tiny
crease
appeared
between
her
dark
eyes.
“Every
morn
and
every
night
he
visits,
unless
duty
interferes.
Her
brother
is
devoted
to
her,
they
share
everything
with...
oh...”
For
a
moment,
the
Myrish
woman
looked
almost
shocked.
Then
a
smile
spread
across
her
face.
“I
have
had
a
most
wicked
thought,
Your
Grace.”

“Best
keep
it
to
yourself.
The
hill
is
thick
with
sparrows,
and
we
all
know
how
sparrows
abhor
wickedness.”

“I
have
heard
they
abhor
soap
and
water
too,
Your
Grace.”

“Perhaps
too
much
prayer
robs
a
man
of
his
sense
of
smell.
I
shall
be
sure
to
ask
His
High
Holiness.”

The
draperies
swayed
back
and
forth
in
a
wash
of
crimson
silk.
“Orton
told
me
that
the
High
Septon
has
no
name,”
Lady
Taena
said.
“Can
that
be
true?
In
Myr
we
all
have
names.”

“Oh,
he
had
a
name
once.
They
all
do.”
The
queen
waved
a
hand
dismissively.
“Even
septons
born
of
noble
blood
go
only
by
their
given
names
once
they
have
taken
their
vows.
When
one
of
them
is
elevated
to
High
Septon,
he
puts
aside
that
name
as
well.
The
Faith
will
tell
you
he
no
longer
has
any
need
of
a
man’s
name,
for
he
has
become
the
avatar
of
the
gods.”

“How
do
you
distinguish
one
High
Septon
from
another?”

“With
difficulty.
One
has
to
say,
‘the
fat
one,’
or
‘the
one
before
the
fat
one,’
or
‘the
old
one
who
died
in
his
sleep.’
You
can
always
winkle
out
their
birth
names
if
you
like,
but
they
take
umbrage
if
you
use
them.
It
reminds
them
that
they
were
born
ordinary
men,
and
they
do
not
like
that.”

“My
lord
husband
tells
me
this
new
one
was
born
with
filth
beneath
his
fingernails.”

“So
I
suspect.
As
a
rule
the
Most
Devout
elevate
one
of
their
own,
but
there
have
been
exceptions.”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
informed
her
of
the
history,
at
tedious
length.
“During
the
reign
of
King
Baelor
the
Blessed
a
simple
stonemason
was
chosen
as
High
Septon.
He
worked
stone
so
beautifully
that
Baelor
decided
he
was
the
Smith
reborn
in
mortal
flesh.
The
man
could
neither
read
nor
write,
nor
recall
the
words
of
the
simplest
of
prayers.”
Some
still
claimed
that
Baelor’s
Hand
had
the
man
poisoned
to
spare
the
realm
embarrassment.
“After
that
one
died,
an
eight-year-old
boy
was
elevated,
once
more
at
King
Baelor’s
urging.
The
boy
worked
miracles,
His
Grace
declared,
though
even
his
little
healing
hands
could
not
save
Baelor
during
his
final
fast.”

Lady
Merryweather
gave
a
laugh.
“Eight
years
old?
Perhaps
my
son
could
be
High
Septon.
He
is
almost
seven.”

“Does
he
pray
a
lot?”
the
queen
asked.

“He
prefers
to
play
with
swords.”

“A
real
boy,
then.
Can
he
name
all
seven
gods?”

“I
think
so.”

“I
shall
have
to
take
him
under
consideration.”
Cersei
did
not
doubt
that
there
were
any
number
of
boys
who
would
do
more
honor
to
the
crystal
crown
than
the
wretch
on
whom
the
Most
Devout
had
chosen
to
bestow
it.
This
is
what
comes
of
letting
fools
and
cowards
rule
themselves.
Next
time,
I
will
choose
their
master
for
them.
And
the
next
time
might
not
be
long
in
coming,
if
the
new
High
Septon
continued
to
annoy
her.
Baelor’s
Hand
had
little
to
teach
Cersei
Lannister
where
such
matters
were
concerned.

“Clear
the
way!”
Ser
Osmund
Kettleblack
was
shouting.
“Make
way
for
the
Queen’s
Grace!”

The
litter
began
to
slow,
which
could
only
mean
that
they
were
near
the
top
of
the
hill.
“You
should
bring
this
son
of
yours
to
court,”
Cersei
told
Lady
Merryweather.
“Six
is
not
too
young.
Tommen
needs
other
boys
about
him.
Why
not
your
son?”
Joffrey
had
never
had
a
close
friend
of
his
own
age,
that
she
recalled.
The
poor
boy
was
always
alone.
I
had
Jaime
when
I
was
a
child...
and
Melara,
until
she
fell
into
the
well.
Joff
had
been
fond
of
the
Hound,
to
be
sure,
but
that
was
not
friendship.
He
was
looking
for
the
father
he
never
found
in
Robert.
A
little
foster
brother
might
be
just
what
Tommen
needs
to
wean
him
away
from
Margaery
and
her
hens.
In
time
they
might
grow
as
close
as
Robert
and
his
boyhood
friend
Ned
Stark.
A
fool,
but
a
loyal
fool.
Tommen
will
have
need
of
loyal
friends
to
watch
his
back.

“Your
Grace
is
kind,
but
Russell
has
never
known
any
home
but
Longtable.
I
fear
he
would
be
lost
in
this
great
city.”

“In
the
beginning,”
the
queen
allowed,
“but
he
will
soon
outgrow
that,
as
I
did.
When
my
father
sent
for
me
to
court
I
wept
and
Jaime
raged,
until
my
aunt
sat
me
down
in
the
Stone
Garden
and
told
me
there
was
no
one
in
King’s
Landing
that
I
need
ever
fear.
‘You
are
a
lioness,’
she
said,
‘and
it
is
for
all
the
lesser
beasts
to
fear
you.’
Your
son
will
find
his
courage
too.
Surely
you
would
prefer
to
have
him
close
at
hand,
where
you
could
see
him
every
day?
He
is
your
only
child,
is
he
not?”

“For
the
present.
My
lord
husband
has
asked
the
gods
to
bless
us
with
another
son,
in
case...”

“I
know.”
She
thought
of
Joffrey,
clawing
at
his
neck.
In
his
last
moments
he
had
looked
to
her
in
desperate
appeal,
and
a
sudden
memory
had
stopped
her
heart;
a
drop
of
red
blood
hissing
in
a
candle
flame,
a
croaking
voice
that
spoke
of
crowns
and
shrouds,
of
death
at
the
hands
of
the
valonqar.

Outside
the
litter,
Ser
Osmund
was
shouting
something,
and
someone
was
shouting
back.
The
litter
jerked
to
a
halt.
“Are
you
all
dead?”
roared
Kettleblack.
“Get
out
of
the
bloody
way!”

The
queen
pulled
back
a
corner
of
the
curtain
and
beckoned
to
Ser
Meryn
Trant.
“What
seems
to
be
the
trouble?”

“The
sparrows,
Your
Grace.”
Ser
Meryn
wore
white
scale
armor
beneath
his
cloak.
His
helm
and
shield
were
slung
from
his
saddle.
“Camping
in
the
street.
We’ll
make
them
move.”

“Do
that,
but
gently.
I
do
not
care
to
be
caught
up
in
another
riot.”
Cersei
let
the
curtain
fall.
“This
is
absurd.”

“It
is,
Your
Grace,”
Lady
Merryweather
agreed.
“The
High
Septon
should
have
come
to
you.
And
these
wretched
sparrows...”

“He
feeds
them,
coddles
them,
blesses
them.
Yet
will
not
bless
the
king.”
The
blessing
was
an
empty
ritual,
she
knew,
but
rituals
and
ceremonies
had
power
in
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant.
Aegon
the
Conqueror
himself
had
dated
the
start
of
his
realm
from
the
day
the
High
Septon
anointed
him
in
Oldtown.
“This
wretched
priest
will
obey,
or
learn
how
weak
and
human
he
still
is.”

“Orton
says
it
is
the
gold
he
really
wants.
That
he
means
to
withhold
his
blessing
until
the
crown
resumes
its
payments.”

“The
Faith
will
have
its
gold
as
soon
as
we
have
peace.”
Septon
Torbert
and
Septon
Raynard
had
been
most
understanding
of
her
plight...
unlike
the
wretched
Braavosi,
who
had
hounded
poor
Lord
Gyles
so
mercilessly
that
he
had
taken
to
his
bed,
coughing
up
blood.
We
had
to
have
those
ships.
She
could
not
rely
upon
the
Arbor
for
her
navy;
the
Redwynes
were
too
close
to
the
Tyrells.
She
needed
her
own
strength
at
sea.

The
dromonds
rising
on
the
river
would
give
her
that.
Her
flagship
would
dip
twice
as
many
oars
as
King
Robert’s
Hammer.
Aurane
had
asked
her
leave
to
name
her
Lord
Tywin,
which
Cersei
had
been
pleased
to
grant.
She
looked
forward
to
hearing
men
speak
of
her
father
as
a
“she.”
Another
of
the
ships
would
be
named
Sweet
Cersei,
and
would
bear
a
gilded
figurehead
carved
in
her
likeness,
clad
in
mail
and
lion
helm,
with
spear
in
hand.
Brave
Joffrey,
Lady
Joanna,
and
Lioness
would
follow
her
to
sea,
along
with
Queen
Margaery,
Golden
Rose,
Lord
Renly,
Lady
Olenna,
and
Princess
Myrcella.
The
queen
had
made
the
mistake
of
telling
Tommen
he
might
name
the
last
five.
He
had
actually
chosen
Moon
Boy
for
one.
Only
when
Lord
Aurane
suggested
that
men
might
not
want
to
serve
on
a
ship
named
for
a
fool
had
the
boy
reluctantly
agreed
to
honor
his
sister
instead.

“If
this
ragged
septon
thinks
to
make
me
buy
Tommen’s
blessing,
he
will
soon
learn
better,”
she
told
Taena.
The
queen
did
not
intend
to
truckle
to
a
pack
of
priests.

The
litter
halted
yet
again,
so
suddenly
that
Cersei
jerked.
“Oh,
this
is
infuriating.”
She
leaned
out
once
more,
and
saw
that
they
had
reached
the
top
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
Ahead
loomed
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
with
its
magnificent
dome
and
seven
shining
towers,
but
between
her
and
the
marble
steps
lay
a
sullen
sea
of
humanity,
brown
and
ragged
and
unwashed.
Sparrows,
she
thought,
sniffing,
though
no
sparrows
had
ever
smelled
so
rank.

Cersei
was
appalled.
Qyburn
had
brought
her
reports
of
their
numbers,
but
hearing
about
them
was
one
thing
and
seeing
them
another.
Hundreds
were
encamped
upon
the
plaza,
hundreds
more
in
the
gardens.
Their
cookfires
filled
the
air
with
smoke
and
stinks.
Roughspun
tents
and
miserable
hovels
made
of
mud
and
scrap
wood
besmirched
the
pristine
white
marble.
They
were
even
huddled
on
the
steps,
beneath
the
Great
Sept’s
towering
doors.

Ser
Osmund
came
trotting
back
to
her.
Beside
him
rode
Ser
Osfryd,
mounted
on
a
stallion
as
golden
as
his
cloak.
Osfryd
was
the
middle
Kettleblack,
quieter
than
his
siblings,
more
apt
to
scowl
than
smile.
And
crueler
as
well,
if
the
tales
are
true.
Perhaps
I
should
have
sent
him
to
the
Wall.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
wanted
an
older
man
“more
seasoned
in
the
ways
of
war”
to
command
the
gold
cloaks,
and
several
of
her
other
councillors
had
agreed
with
him.
“Ser
Osfryd
is
seasoned
quite
sufficiently,”
she
had
told
them,
but
even
that
did
not
shut
them
up.
They
yap
at
me
like
a
pack
of
small,
annoying
dogs.
Her
patience
with
Pycelle
had
all
but
run
its
course.
He
had
even
had
the
temerity
to
object
to
her
sending
to
Dorne
for
a
master-at-arms,
on
the
grounds
that
it
might
offend
the
Tyrells.
“Why
do
you
think
I’m
doing
it?”
she
had
asked
him
scornfully.

“Beg
pardon,
Your
Grace,”
said
Ser
Osmund.
“My
brother’s
summoning
more
gold
cloaks.
We’ll
clear
a
path,
never
fear.”

“I
do
not
have
the
time.
I
will
continue
on
afoot.”

“Please,
Your
Grace.”
Taena
caught
her
arm.
“They
frighten
me.
There
are
hundreds
of
them,
and
so
dirty.”

Cersei
kissed
her
cheek.
“The
lion
does
not
fear
the
sparrow...
but
it
is
good
of
you
to
care.
I
know
you
love
me
well,
my
lady.
Ser
Osmund,
kindly
help
me
down.”

If
I
had
known
I
was
going
to
have
to
walk,
I
would
have
dressed
for
it.
She
wore
a
white
gown
slashed
with
cloth-of-gold,
lacy
but
demure.
It
had
been
several
years
since
the
last
time
she
had
donned
it,
and
the
queen
found
it
uncomfortably
tight
about
the
middle.
“Ser
Osmund,
Ser
Meryn,
you
will
accompany
me.
Ser
Osfryd,
see
that
my
litter
comes
to
no
harm.”
Some
of
the
sparrows
looked
gaunt
and
hollow-eyed
enough
to
eat
her
horses.

As
she
made
her
way
through
the
ragged
throng,
past
their
cookfires,
wagons,
and
crude
shelters,
the
queen
found
herself
remembering
another
crowd
that
had
once
gathered
on
this
plaza.
The
day
she
wed
Robert
Baratheon,
thousands
had
turned
out
to
cheer
for
them.
All
the
women
wore
their
best,
and
half
the
men
had
children
on
their
shoulders.
When
she
had
emerged
from
inside
the
sept,
hand
in
hand
with
the
young
king,
the
crowd
sent
up
a
roar
so
loud
it
could
be
heard
in
Lannisport.
“They
like
you
well,
my
lady,”
Robert
whispered
in
her
ear.
“See,
every
face
is
smiling.”
For
that
one
short
moment
she
had
been
happy
in
her
marriage...
until
she
chanced
to
glance
at
Jaime.
No,
she
remembered
thinking,
not
every
face,
my
lord.

No
one
was
smiling
now.
The
looks
the
sparrows
gave
her
were
dull,
sullen,
hostile.
They
made
way
but
reluctantly.
If
they
were
truly
sparrows,
a
shout
would
send
them
flying.
A
hundred
gold
cloaks
with
staves
and
swords
and
maces
could
clear
this
rabble
quick
enough.
That
was
what
Lord
Tywin
would
have
done.
He
would
have
ridden
over
them
instead
of
walking
through.

When
she
saw
what
they
had
done
to
Baelor
the
Beloved,
the
queen
had
cause
to
rue
her
soft
heart.
The
great
marble
statue
that
had
smiled
serenely
over
the
plaza
for
a
hundred
years
was
waist-deep
in
a
heap
of
bones
and
skulls.
Some
of
the
skulls
had
scraps
of
flesh
still
clinging
to
them.
A
crow
sat
atop
one
such,
enjoying
a
dry,
leathery
feast.
Flies
were
everywhere.
“What
is
the
meaning
of
this?”
Cersei
demanded
of
the
crowd.
“Do
you
mean
to
bury
Blessed
Baelor
in
a
mountain
of
carrion?”

A
one-legged
man
stepped
forward,
leaning
on
a
wooden
crutch.
“Your
Grace,
these
are
the
bones
of
holy
men
and
women,
murdered
for
their
faith.
Septons,
septas,
brothers
brown
and
dun
and
green,
sisters
white
and
blue
and
grey.
Some
were
hanged,
some
disemboweled.
Septs
have
been
despoiled,
maidens
and
mothers
raped
by
godless
men
and
demon
worshipers.
Even
silent
sisters
have
been
molested.
The
Mother
Above
cries
out
in
her
anguish.
We
have
brought
their
bones
here
from
all
over
the
realm,
to
bear
witness
to
the
agony
of
the
Holy
Faith.”

Cersei
could
feel
the
weight
of
eyes
upon
her.
“The
king
shall
know
of
these
atrocities,”
she
answered
solemnly.
“Tommen
will
share
your
outrage.
This
is
the
work
of
Stannis
and
his
red
witch,
and
the
savage
northmen
who
worship
trees
and
wolves.”
She
raised
her
voice.
“Good
people,
your
dead
shall
be
avenged!”

A
few
cheered,
but
only
a
few.
“We
ask
no
vengeance
for
our
dead,”
said
the
one-legged
man,
“only
protection
for
the
living.
For
the
septs
and
holy
places.”

“The
Iron
Throne
must
defend
the
Faith,”
growled
a
hulking
lout
with
a
seven-pointed
star
painted
on
his
brow.
“A
king
who
does
not
protect
his
people
is
no
king
at
all.”
Mutters
of
assent
went
up
from
those
around
him.
One
man
had
the
temerity
to
grasp
Ser
Meryn
by
the
wrist,
and
say,
“It
is
time
for
all
anointed
knights
to
forsake
their
worldly
masters
and
defend
our
Holy
Faith.
Stand
with
us,
ser,
if
you
love
the
Seven.”

“Unhand
me,”
said
Ser
Meryn,
wrenching
free.

“I
hear
you,”
Cersei
said.
“My
son
is
young,
but
he
loves
the
Seven
well.
You
shall
have
his
protection,
and
mine
own.”

The
man
with
the
star
upon
his
brow
was
not
appeased.
“The
Warrior
will
defend
us,”
he
said,
“not
this
fat
boy
king.”

Meryn
Trant
reached
for
his
sword,
but
Cersei
stopped
him
before
he
could
unsheathe
it.
She
had
only
two
knights
amidst
a
sea
of
sparrows.
She
saw
staves
and
scythes,
cudgels
and
clubs,
several
axes.
“I
will
have
no
blood
shed
in
this
holy
place,
ser.”
Why
are
all
men
such
children?
Cut
him
down,
and
the
rest
will
tear
us
limb
from
limb.
“We
are
all
the
Mother’s
children.
Come,
His
High
Holiness
awaits
us.”
But
as
she
made
her
way
through
the
press
to
the
steps
of
the
sept,
a
gaggle
of
armed
men
stepped
out
to
block
the
doors.
They
wore
mail
and
boiled
leather,
with
here
and
there
a
bit
of
dinted
plate.
Some
had
spears
and
some
had
longswords.
More
favored
axes,
and
had
sewn
red
stars
upon
their
bleached
white
surcoats.
Two
had
the
insolence
to
cross
their
spears
and
bar
her
way.

“Is
this
how
you
receive
your
queen?”
she
demanded
of
them.
“Pray,
where
are
Raynard
and
Torbert?”
It
was
not
like
those
two
to
miss
a
chance
to
fawn
on
her.
Torbert
always
made
a
show
of
getting
down
on
his
knees
to
wash
her
feet.

“I
do
not
know
the
men
you
speak
of,”
said
one
of
the
men
with
a
red
star
on
his
surcoat,
“but
if
they
are
of
the
Faith,
no
doubt
the
Seven
had
need
of
their
service.”

“Septon
Raynard
and
Septon
Torbert
are
of
the
Most
Devout,”
Cersei
said,
“and
will
be
furious
to
learn
that
you
obstructed
me.
Do
you
mean
to
deny
me
entrance
to
Baelor’s
holy
sept?”

“Your
Grace,”
said
a
greybeard
with
a
stooped
shoulder.
“You
are
welcome
here,
but
your
men
must
leave
their
swordbelts.
No
weapons
are
allowed
within,
by
command
of
the
High
Septon.”

“Knights
of
the
Kingsguard
do
not
set
aside
their
swords,
not
even
in
the
presence
of
the
king.”

“In
the
king’s
house,
the
king’s
word
must
rule,”
replied
the
aged
knight,
“but
this
is
the
house
of
the
gods.”

Color
rose
to
her
cheeks.
One
word
to
Meryn
Trant,
and
the
stoop-backed
greybeard
would
be
meeting
his
gods
sooner
than
he
might
have
liked.
Not
here,
though.
Not
now.
“Wait
for
me,”
she
told
the
Kingsguard
curtly.
Alone,
she
climbed
the
steps.
The
spearmen
uncrossed
their
spears.
Two
other
men
put
their
weight
against
the
doors,
and
with
a
great
groan
they
swung
apart.

In
the
Hall
of
Lamps,
Cersei
found
a
score
of
septons
on
their
knees,
but
not
in
prayer.
They
had
pails
of
soap
and
water,
and
were
scrubbing
at
the
floor.
Their
roughspun
robes
and
sandals
led
Cersei
to
take
them
for
sparrows,
until
one
raised
his
head.
His
face
was
red
as
a
beet,
and
there
were
broken
blisters
on
his
hands,
bleeding.
“Your
Grace.”

“Septon
Raynard?”
The
queen
could
scarce
believe
what
she
was
seeing.
“What
are
you
doing
on
your
knees?”

“He
is
cleaning
the
floor.”
The
speaker
was
shorter
than
the
queen
by
several
inches
and
as
thin
as
a
broom
handle.
“Work
is
a
form
of
prayer,
most
pleasing
to
the
Smith.”
He
stood,
scrub
brush
in
hand.
“Your
Grace.
We
have
been
expecting
you.”

The
man’s
beard
was
grey
and
brown
and
closely
trimmed,
his
hair
tied
up
in
a
hard
knot
behind
his
head.
Though
his
robes
were
clean,
they
were
frayed
and
patched
as
well.
He
had
rolled
his
sleeves
up
his
elbows
as
he
scrubbed,
but
below
the
knees
the
cloth
was
soaked
and
sodden.
His
face
was
sharply
pointed,
with
deep-set
eyes
as
brown
as
mud.
His
feet
are
bare,
she
saw
with
dismay.
They
were
hideous
as
well,
hard
and
horny
things,
thick
with
callus.
“You
are
His
High
Holiness?”

“We
are.”

Father,
give
me
strength.
The
queen
knew
that
she
should
kneel,
but
the
floor
was
wet
with
soap
and
dirty
water
and
she
did
not
wish
to
ruin
her
gown.
She
glanced
over
at
the
old
men
on
their
knees.
“I
do
not
see
my
friend
Septon
Torbert.”

“Septon
Torbert
has
been
confined
to
a
penitent’s
cell
on
bread
and
water.
It
is
sinful
for
any
man
to
be
so
plump
when
half
the
realm
is
starving.”

Cersei
had
suffered
quite
enough
for
one
day.
She
let
him
see
her
anger.
“Is
this
how
you
greet
me?
With
a
scrub
brush
in
your
hand,
dripping
water?
Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“Your
Grace
is
the
Queen
Regent
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
the
man
said,
“but
in
The
Seven-Pointed
Star
it
is
written
that
as
men
bow
to
their
lords,
and
lords
to
their
kings,
so
kings
and
queens
must
bow
before
the
Seven
Who
Are
One.”

Is
he
telling
me
to
kneel?
If
so,
he
did
not
know
her
very
well.
“By
rights
you
should
have
met
me
on
the
steps
in
your
finest
robes,
with
the
crystal
crown
upon
your
head.”

“We
have
no
crown,
Your
Grace.”

Her
frown
deepened.
“My
lord
father
gave
your
predecessor
a
crown
of
rare
beauty,
wrought
in
crystal
and
spun
gold.”

“And
for
that
gift
we
honor
him
in
our
prayers,”
the
High
Septon
said,
“but
the
poor
need
food
in
their
bellies
more
than
we
need
gold
and
crystal
on
our
head.
That
crown
has
been
sold.
So
have
the
others
in
our
vaults,
and
all
our
rings,
and
our
robes
of
cloth-of-gold
and
cloth-of-silver.
Wool
will
keep
a
man
as
warm.
That
is
why
the
Seven
gave
us
sheep.”

He
is
utterly
mad.
The
Most
Devout
must
have
been
mad
as
well,
to
elevate
this
creature...
mad,
or
terrified
of
the
beggars
at
their
doors.
Qyburn’s
whisperers
claimed
that
Septon
Luceon
had
been
nine
votes
from
elevation
when
those
doors
had
given
way,
and
the
sparrows
came
pouring
into
the
Great
Sept
with
their
leader
on
their
shoulders
and
their
axes
in
their
hands.

She
fixed
the
small
man
with
an
icy
stare.
“Is
there
someplace
where
we
may
speak
more
privily,
Your
Holiness?”

The
High
Septon
surrendered
his
scrub
brush
to
one
of
the
Most
Devout.
“If
Your
Grace
will
follow
us?”

He
led
her
through
the
inner
doors,
into
the
sept
proper.
Their
footsteps
echoed
off
the
marble
floor.
Dust
motes
swam
in
the
beams
of
colored
light
slanting
down
through
the
leaded
glass
of
the
great
dome.
Incense
sweetened
the
air,
and
beside
the
seven
altars
candles
shone
like
stars.
A
thousand
twinkled
for
the
Mother
and
near
as
many
for
the
Maid,
but
you
could
count
the
Stranger’s
candles
on
two
hands
and
still
have
fingers
left.

Even
here
the
sparrows
had
invaded.
A
dozen
scruffy
hedge
knights
were
kneeling
before
the
Warrior,
beseeching
him
to
bless
the
swords
they
had
piled
at
his
feet.
At
the
Mother’s
altar,
a
septon
was
leading
a
hundred
sparrows
in
prayer,
their
voices
as
distant
as
waves
upon
the
shore.
The
High
Septon
led
Cersei
to
where
the
Crone
raised
her
lantern.
When
he
knelt
before
the
altar,
she
had
no
choice
but
to
kneel
beside
him.
Mercifully,
this
High
Septon
was
not
as
long-winded
as
the
fat
one
had
been.
I
should
be
grateful
for
that
much,
I
suppose.

His
High
Holiness
made
no
move
to
rise
when
his
prayer
was
done.
It
would
seem
they
must
confer
upon
their
knees.
A
small
man’s
ploy,
she
thought,
amused.
“High
Holiness,”
she
said,
“these
sparrows
are
frightening
the
city.
I
want
them
gone.”

“Where
should
they
go,
Your
Grace?”

There
are
seven
hells,
any
one
of
them
will
serve.
“Back
where
they
came
from,
I
would
imagine.”

“They
came
from
everywhere.
As
the
sparrow
is
the
humblest
and
most
common
of
the
birds,
they
are
the
humblest
and
most
common
of
men.”

They
are
common,
we
agree
on
that
much.
“Have
you
seen
what
they
have
done
to
Blessed
Baelor’s
statue?
They
befoul
the
plaza
with
their
pigs
and
goats
and
night
soil.”

“Night
soil
can
be
washed
away
more
easily
than
blood,
Your
Grace.
If
the
plaza
was
befouled,
it
was
befouled
by
the
execution
that
was
done
here.”

He
dares
throw
Ned
Stark
in
my
face?
“We
all
regret
that.
Joffrey
was
young,
and
not
as
wise
as
he
might
have
been.
Lord
Stark
should
have
been
beheaded
elsewhere,
out
of
respect
for
Blessed
Baelor...
but
the
man
was
a
traitor,
let
us
not
forget.”

“King
Baelor
forgave
those
who
conspired
against
him.”

King
Baelor
imprisoned
his
own
sisters,
whose
only
crime
was
being
beautiful.
The
first
time
Cersei
heard
that
tale,
she
had
gone
to
Tyrion’s
nursery
and
pinched
the
little
monster
till
he
cried.
I
should
have
pinched
his
nose
shut
and
stuffed
my
sock
into
his
mouth.
She
forced
herself
to
smile.
“King
Tommen
will
forgive
the
sparrows
too,
once
they
have
returned
to
their
homes.”

“Most
have
lost
their
homes.
Suffering
is
everywhere...
and
grief,
and
death.
Before
coming
to
King’s
Landing,
I
tended
to
half
a
hundred
little
villages
too
small
to
have
a
septon
of
their
own.
I
walked
from
each
one
to
the
next,
performing
marriages,
absolving
sinners
of
their
sins,
naming
newborn
children.
Those
villages
are
no
more,
Your
Grace.
Weeds
and
thorns
grow
where
gardens
once
flourished,
and
bones
litter
the
roadsides.”

“War
is
a
dreadful
thing.
These
atrocities
are
the
work
of
the
northmen,
and
of
Lord
Stannis
and
his
demon-worshipers.”

“Some
of
my
sparrows
speak
of
bands
of
lions
who
despoiled
them...
and
of
the
Hound,
who
was
your
own
sworn
man.
At
Saltpans
he
slew
an
aged
septon
and
despoiled
a
girl
of
twelve,
an
innocent
child
promised
to
the
Faith.
He
wore
his
armor
as
he
raped
her
and
her
tender
flesh
was
torn
and
crushed
by
his
iron
mail.
When
he
was
done
he
gave
her
to
his
men,
who
cut
off
her
nose
and
nipples.”

“His
Grace
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
the
crimes
of
every
man
who
ever
served
House
Lannister.
Sandor
Clegane
is
a
traitor
and
a
brute.
Why
do
you
think
I
dismissed
him
from
our
service?
He
fights
for
the
outlaw
Beric
Dondarrion
now,
not
for
King
Tommen.”

“As
you
say.
Yet
it
must
be
asked—where
were
the
king’s
knights
when
these
things
were
being
done?
Did
not
Jaehaerys
the
Conciliator
once
swear
upon
the
Iron
Throne
itself
that
the
crown
would
always
protect
and
defend
the
Faith?”

Cersei
had
no
idea
what
Jaehaerys
the
Conciliator
might
have
sworn.
“He
did,”
she
agreed,
“and
the
High
Septon
blessed
him
and
anointed
him
as
king.
It
is
traditional
for
every
new
High
Septon
to
give
the
king
his
blessing...
and
yet
you
have
refused
to
bless
King
Tommen.”

“Your
Grace
is
mistaken.
We
have
not
refused.”

“You
have
not
come.”

“The
hour
is
not
yet
ripe.”

Are
you
a
priest
or
a
greengrocer?
“And
what
might
I
do
to
make
it...
riper?”
If
he
dares
mention
gold,
I
will
deal
with
this
one
as
I
did
the
last
and
find
a
pious
eight-year-old
to
wear
the
crystal
crown.

“The
realm
is
full
of
kings.
For
the
Faith
to
exalt
one
above
the
rest
we
must
be
certain.
Three
hundred
years
ago,
when
Aegon
the
Dragon
landed
beneath
this
very
hill,
the
High
Septon
locked
himself
within
the
Starry
Sept
of
Oldtown
and
prayed
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights,
taking
no
nourishment
but
bread
and
water.
When
he
emerged
he
announced
that
the
Faith
would
not
oppose
Aegon
and
his
sisters,
for
the
Crone
had
lifted
up
her
lamp
to
show
him
what
lay
ahead.
If
Oldtown
took
up
arms
against
the
Dragon,
Oldtown
would
burn,
and
the
Hightower
and
the
Citadel
and
the
Starry
Sept
would
be
cast
down
and
destroyed.
Lord
Hightower
was
a
godly
man.
When
he
heard
the
prophecy,
he
kept
his
strength
at
home
and
opened
the
city
gates
to
Aegon
when
he
came.
And
His
High
Holiness
anointed
the
Conqueror
with
the
seven
oils.
I
must
do
as
he
did,
three
hundred
years
ago.
I
must
pray,
and
fast.”

“For
seven
days
and
seven
nights?”

“For
as
long
as
need
be.”

Cersei
itched
to
slap
his
solemn,
pious
face.
I
could
help
you
fast,
she
thought.
I
could
shut
you
up
in
some
tower
and
see
that
no
one
brings
you
food
until
the
gods
have
spoken.
“These
false
kings
espouse
false
gods,”
she
reminded
him.
“Only
King
Tommen
defends
the
Holy
Faith.”

“Yet
everywhere
septs
are
burned
and
looted.
Even
silent
sisters
have
been
raped,
crying
their
anguish
to
the
sky.
Your
Grace
has
seen
the
bones
and
skulls
of
our
holy
dead?”

“I
have,”
she
had
to
say.
“Give
Tommen
your
blessing,
and
he
shall
put
an
end
to
these
outrages.”

“And
how
shall
he
do
that,
Your
Grace?
Will
he
send
a
knight
to
walk
the
roads
with
every
begging
brother?
Will
he
give
us
men
to
guard
our
septas
against
the
wolves
and
lions?”

I
will
pretend
you
did
not
mention
lions.
“The
realm
is
at
war.
His
Grace
has
need
of
every
man.”
Cersei
did
not
intend
to
squander
Tommen’s
strength
playing
wet
nurse
to
sparrows,
or
guarding
the
wrinkled
cunts
of
a
thousand
sour
septas.
Half
of
them
are
probably
praying
for
a
good
raping.
“Your
sparrows
have
clubs
and
axes.
Let
them
defend
themselves.”

“King
Maegor’s
laws
prohibit
that,
as
Your
Grace
must
know.
It
was
by
his
decree
that
the
Faith
laid
down
its
swords.”

“Tommen
is
king
now,
not
Maegor.”
What
did
she
care
what
Maegor
the
Cruel
had
decreed
three
hundred
years
ago?
Instead
of
taking
the
swords
out
of
the
hands
of
the
faithful,
he
should
have
used
them
for
his
own
ends.
She
pointed
to
where
the
Warrior
stood
above
his
altar
of
red
marble.
“What
is
that
he
holds?”

“A
sword.”

“Has
he
forgotten
how
to
use
it?”

“Maegor’s
laws—”

“—could
be
undone.”
She
let
that
hang
there,
waiting
for
the
High
Sparrow
to
rise
to
the
bait.

He
did
not
disappoint
her.
“The
Faith
Militant
reborn...
that
would
be
the
answer
to
three
hundred
years
of
prayer,
Your
Grace.
The
Warrior
would
lift
his
shining
sword
again
and
cleanse
this
sinful
realm
of
all
its
evil.
If
His
Grace
were
to
allow
me
to
restore
the
ancient
blessed
orders
of
the
Sword
and
Star,
every
godly
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
would
know
him
to
be
our
true
and
rightful
lord.”

That
was
sweet
to
hear,
but
Cersei
took
care
not
to
seem
too
eager.
“Your
High
Holiness
spoke
of
forgiveness
earlier.
In
these
troubled
times,
King
Tommen
would
be
most
grateful
if
you
could
see
your
way
to
forgiving
the
crown’s
debt.
It
seems
to
me
we
owe
the
Faith
some
nine
hundred
thousand
dragons.”

“Nine
hundred
thousand
six
hundred
and
seventy-four
dragons.
Gold
that
could
feed
the
hungry
and
rebuild
a
thousand
septs.”

“Is
it
gold
you
want?”
the
queen
asked.
“Or
do
you
want
these
dusty
laws
of
Maegor’s
set
aside?”

The
High
Septon
pondered
that
a
moment.
“As
you
wish.
This
debt
shall
be
forgiven,
and
King
Tommen
will
have
his
blessing.
The
Warrior’s
Sons
shall
escort
me
to
him,
shining
in
the
glory
of
their
Faith,
whilst
my
sparrows
go
forth
to
defend
the
meek
and
humble
of
the
land,
reborn
as
Poor
Fellows
as
of
old.”

The
queen
got
to
her
feet
and
smoothed
her
skirts.
“I
shall
have
the
papers
drawn
up,
and
His
Grace
will
sign
them
and
affix
them
with
the
royal
seal.”
If
there
was
one
part
of
kingship
that
Tommen
loved,
it
was
playing
with
his
seal.

“Seven
save
His
Grace.
Long
may
he
reign.”
The
High
Septon
made
a
steeple
of
his
hands
and
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven.
“Let
the
wicked
tremble!”

Do
you
hear
that,
Lord
Stannis?
Cersei
could
not
help
but
smile.
Even
her
lord
father
could
have
done
no
better.
At
a
stroke,
she
had
rid
King’s
Landing
of
the
plague
of
sparrows,
secured
Tommen’s
blessing,
and
lessened
the
crown’s
debt
by
close
to
a
million
dragons.
Her
heart
was
soar-ing
as
she
allowed
the
High
Septon
to
escort
her
back
to
the
Hall
of
Lamps.

Lady
Merryweather
shared
the
queen’s
delight,
though
she
had
never
heard
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons
or
the
Poor
Fellows.
“They
date
from
before
Aegon’s
Conquest,”
Cersei
explained
to
her.
“The
Warrior’s
Sons
were
an
order
of
knights
who
gave
up
their
lands
and
gold
and
swore
their
swords
to
His
High
Holiness.
The
Poor
Fellows...
they
were
humbler,
though
far
more
numerous.
Begging
brothers
of
a
sort,
though
they
carried
axes
instead
of
bowls.
They
wandered
the
roads,
escorting
travelers
from
sept
to
sept
and
town
to
town.
Their
badge
was
the
seven-pointed
star,
red
on
white,
so
the
smallfolk
named
them
Stars.
The
Warrior’s
Sons
wore
rainbow
cloaks
and
inlaid
silver
armor
over
hair
shirts,
and
bore
star-shaped
crystals
in
the
pommels
of
their
longswords.
They
were
the
Swords.
Holy
men,
ascetics,
fanatics,
sorcerers,
dragonslayers,
demonhunters...
there
were
many
tales
about
them.
But
all
agree
that
they
were
implacable
in
their
hatred
for
all
enemies
of
the
Holy
Faith.”

Lady
Merryweather
understood
at
once.
“Enemies
such
as
Lord
Stannis
and
his
red
sorceress,
perhaps?”

“Why,
yes,
as
it
happens,”
said
Cersei,
giggling
like
a
girl.
“Shall
we
broach
a
flagon
of
hippocras
and
drink
to
the
fervor
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons
on
our
way
home?”

“To
the
fervor
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons
and
the
brilliance
of
the
Queen
Regent.
To
Cersei,
the
First
of
Her
Name!”

The
hippocras
was
as
sweet
and
savory
as
Cersei’s
triumph,
and
the
queen’s
litter
seemed
almost
to
float
back
across
the
city.
But
at
the
base
of
Aegon’s
High
Hill,
they
encountered
Margaery
Tyrell
and
her
cousins
returning
from
a
ride.
She
dogs
me
everywhere
I
go,
Cersei
thought
with
annoyance
when
she
laid
eyes
on
the
little
queen.

Behind
Margaery
came
a
long
tail
of
courtiers,
guards,
and
servants,
many
of
them
laden
with
baskets
of
fresh
flowers.
Each
of
her
cousins
had
an
admirer
in
thrall;
the
gangly
squire
Alyn
Ambrose
rode
with
Elinor,
to
whom
he
was
betrothed,
Ser
Tallad
with
shy
Alla,
one-armed
Mark
Mullendore
with
Megga,
plump
and
laughing.
The
Redwyne
twins
were
escorting
two
of
Margaery’s
other
ladies,
Meredyth
Crane
and
Janna
Fossoway.
The
women
all
wore
flowers
in
their
hair.
Jalabhar
Xho
had
attached
himself
to
the
party
too,
as
had
Ser
Lambert
Turnberry
with
his
eye
patch,
and
the
handsome
singer
known
as
the
Blue
Bard.

And
of
course
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
must
accompany
the
little
queen,
and
of
course
it
is
the
Knight
of
Flowers.
In
white
scale
armor
chased
with
gold,
Ser
Loras
glittered.
Though
he
no
longer
presumed
to
train
Tommen
at
arms,
the
king
still
spent
far
too
much
time
in
his
company.
Every
time
the
boy
returned
from
an
afternoon
with
his
little
wife,
he
had
some
new
tale
to
tell
about
something
that
Ser
Loras
had
said
or
done.

Margaery
hailed
them
when
the
two
columns
met
and
fell
in
beside
the
queen’s
litter.
Her
cheeks
were
flushed,
her
brown
ringlets
tumbling
loosely
about
her
shoulders,
stirred
by
every
puff
of
wind.
“We
have
been
picking
autumn
flowers
in
the
kingswood,”
she
told
them.

I
know
where
you
were,
the
queen
thought.
Her
informers
were
very
good
about
keeping
her
apprised
of
Margaery’s
movements.
Such
a
restless
girl,
our
little
queen.
She
seldom
let
more
than
three
days
pass
without
going
off
for
a
ride.
Some
days
they
would
ride
along
the
Rosby
road
to
hunt
for
shells
and
eat
beside
the
sea.
Other
times
she
would
take
her
entourage
across
the
river
for
an
afternoon
of
hawking.
The
little
queen
was
fond
of
going
out
on
boats
as
well,
sailing
up
and
down
the
Blackwater
Rush
to
no
particular
purpose.
When
she
was
feeling
pious
she
would
leave
the
castle
to
pray
at
Baelor’s
Sept.
She
gave
her
custom
to
a
dozen
different
seamstresses,
was
well-known
amongst
the
city’s
goldsmiths,
and
had
even
been
known
to
visit
the
fish
market
by
the
Mud
Gate
for
a
look
at
the
day’s
catch.
Wherever
she
went,
the
smallfolk
fawned
on
her,
and
Lady
Margaery
did
all
she
could
to
fan
their
ardor.
She
was
forever
giving
alms
to
beggars,
buying
hot
pies
off
bakers’
carts,
and
reining
up
to
speak
to
common
tradesmen.

Had
it
been
up
to
her,
she
would
have
had
Tommen
doing
all
these
things
as
well.
She
was
forever
inviting
him
to
accompany
her
and
her
hens
on
their
adventures,
and
the
boy
was
forever
pleading
with
his
mother
for
leave
to
go
along.
The
queen
had
given
her
consent
a
few
times,
if
only
to
allow
Ser
Osney
to
spend
a
few
more
hours
in
Margaery’s
company.
For
all
the
good
it
has
done.
Osney
has
proved
a
grievous
disappointment.
“Do
you
remember
the
day
your
sister
sailed
for
Dorne?”
Cersei
asked
her
son.
“Do
you
recall
the
mob
howling
on
our
way
back
to
the
castle?
The
stones,
the
curses?”

But
the
king
was
deaf
to
sense,
thanks
to
his
little
queen.
“If
we
mingle
with
the
commons,
they
will
love
us
better.”

“The
mob
loved
the
fat
High
Septon
so
well
they
tore
him
limb
from
limb,
and
him
a
holy
man,”
she
reminded
him.
All
it
did
was
make
him
sullen
with
her.
Just
as
Margaery
wants,
I
wager.
Every
day
in
every
way
she
tries
to
steal
him
from
me.
Joffrey
would
have
seen
through
her
schemer’s
smile
and
let
her
know
her
place,
but
Tommen
was
more
gullible.
She
knew
Joff
was
too
strong
for
her,
Cersei
thought,
remembering
the
gold
coin
Qyburn
had
found.
For
House
Tyrell
to
hope
to
rule,
he
had
to
be
removed.
It
came
back
to
her
that
Margaery
and
her
hideous
grandmother
had
once
plotted
to
marry
Sansa
Stark
to
the
little
queen’s
crippled
brother
Willas.
Lord
Tywin
had
forestalled
that
by
stealing
a
march
on
them
and
wedding
Sansa
to
Tyrion,
but
the
link
had
been
there.
They
are
all
in
it
together,
she
realized
with
a
start.
The
Tyrells
bribed
the
gaolers
to
free
Tyrion,
and
whisked
him
down
the
roseroad
to
join
his
vile
bride.
By
now
the
both
of
them
are
safe
in
Highgarden,
hidden
away
behind
a
wall
of
roses.

“You
should
have
come
along
with
us,
Your
Grace,”
the
little
schemer
prattled
on
as
they
climbed
the
slope
of
Aegon’s
High
Hill.
“We
could
have
had
such
a
lovely
time
together.
The
trees
are
gowned
in
gold
and
red
and
orange,
and
there
are
flowers
everywhere.
Chestnuts
too.
We
roasted
some
on
our
way
home.”

“I
have
no
time
for
riding
through
the
woods
and
picking
flowers,”
Cersei
said.
“I
have
a
kingdom
to
rule.”

“Only
one,
Your
Grace?
Who
rules
the
other
six?”
Margaery
laughed
a
merry
little
laugh.
“You
will
forgive
me
my
jest,
I
hope.
I
know
what
a
burden
you
bear.
You
should
let
me
share
the
load.
There
must
be
some
things
I
could
do
to
help
you.
It
would
put
to
rest
all
this
talk
that
you
and
I
are
rivals
for
the
king.”

“Is
that
what
they
say?”
Cersei
smiled.
“How
foolish.
I
have
never
looked
upon
you
as
a
rival,
not
even
for
a
moment.”

“I
am
so
pleased
to
hear
that.”
The
girl
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
she
had
been
cut.
“You
and
Tommen
must
come
with
us
the
next
time.
I
know
His
Grace
would
love
it.
The
Blue
Bard
played
for
us,
and
Ser
Tallad
showed
us
how
to
fight
with
a
staff
the
way
the
smallfolk
do.
The
woods
are
so
beautiful
in
autumn.”

“My
late
husband
loved
the
forest
too.”
In
the
early
years
of
their
marriage,
Robert
was
forever
imploring
her
to
hunt
with
him,
but
Cersei
had
always
begged
off.
His
hunting
trips
allowed
her
time
with
Jaime.
Golden
days
and
silver
nights.
It
was
a
dangerous
dance
that
they
had
danced,
to
be
sure.
Eyes
and
ears
were
everywhere
within
the
Red
Keep,
and
one
could
never
be
certain
when
Robert
would
return.
Somehow
the
peril
had
only
served
to
make
their
times
together
that
much
more
thrilling.
“Still,
beauty
can
sometimes
mask
deadly
danger,”
she
warned
the
little
queen.
“Robert
lost
his
life
in
the
woods.”

Margaery
smiled
at
Ser
Loras;
a
sweet
sisterly
smile,
full
of
fondness.
“Your
Grace
is
kind
to
fear
for
me,
but
my
brother
keeps
me
well
protected.”

Go
and
hunt,
Cersei
had
urged
Robert,
half
a
hundred
times.
My
brother
keeps
me
well
protected.
She
recalled
what
Taena
had
told
her
earlier,
and
a
laugh
came
bursting
from
her
lips.

“Your
Grace
laughs
so
prettily.”
Lady
Margaery
gave
her
a
quizzical
smile.
“Might
we
share
the
jest?”

“You
will,”
the
queen
said.
“I
promise
you,
you
will.”





THE
REAVER

The
drums
were
pounding
out
a
battle
beat
as
the
Iron
Victory
swept
forward,
her
ram
cutting
through
the
choppy
green
waters.
The
smaller
ship
ahead
was
turning,
oars
slapping
at
the
sea.
Roses
streamed
upon
her
banners;
fore
and
aft
a
white
rose
upon
a
red
escutcheon,
atop
her
mast
a
golden
one
on
a
field
as
green
as
grass.
The
Iron
Victory
raked
her
side
so
hard
that
half
the
boarding
party
lost
their
feet.
Oars
snapped
and
splintered,
sweet
music
to
the
captain’s
ears.

He
vaulted
over
the
gunwale,
landing
on
the
deck
below
with
his
golden
cloak
billowing
behind
him.
The
white
roses
drew
back,
as
men
always
did
at
the
sight
of
Victarion
Greyjoy
armed
and
armored,
his
face
hidden
behind
his
kraken
helm.
They
were
clutching
swords
and
spears
and
axes,
but
nine
of
every
ten
wore
no
armor,
and
the
tenth
had
only
a
shirt
of
sewn
scales.
These
are
no
ironmen,
Victarion
thought.
They
still
fear
drowning.

“Get
him!”
one
man
shouted.
“He’s
alone!”

“COME!”
he
roared
back.
“Come
kill
me,
if
you
can.”

From
all
sides
the
rosey
warriors
converged,
with
grey
steel
in
their
hands
and
terror
behind
their
eyes.
Their
fear
was
so
ripe
Victarion
could
taste
it.
Left
and
right
he
laid
about,
hewing
off
the
first
man’s
arm
at
the
elbow,
cleaving
through
the
shoulder
of
the
second.
The
third
buried
his
own
axehead
in
the
soft
pine
of
Victarion’s
shield.
He
slammed
it
into
the
fool’s
face,
knocked
him
off
his
feet,
and
slew
him
when
he
tried
to
rise
again.
As
he
was
struggling
to
free
his
axe
from
the
dead
man’s
rib
cage,
a
spear
jabbed
him
between
the
shoulder
blades.
It
felt
as
though
someone
had
slapped
him
on
the
back.
Victarion
spun
and
slammed
his
axe
down
onto
the
spearman’s
head,
feeling
the
impact
in
his
arm
as
the
steel
went
crunching
through
helm
and
hair
and
skull.
The
man
swayed
for
half
a
heartbeat,
till
the
iron
captain
wrenched
the
steel
free
and
sent
his
corpse
staggering
loose-limbed
across
the
deck,
looking
more
drunk
than
dead.

By
then
his
ironborn
had
followed
him
down
onto
the
deck
of
the
broken
longship.
He
heard
Wulfe
One-Ear
let
out
a
howl
as
he
went
to
work,
glimpsed
Ragnor
Pyke
in
his
rusted
mail,
saw
Nute
the
Barber
send
a
throwing
axe
spinning
through
the
air
to
catch
a
man
in
the
chest.
Victarion
slew
another
man,
and
another.
He
would
have
killed
a
third,
but
Ragnor
cut
him
down
first.
“Well
struck,”
Victarion
bellowed
at
him.

When
he
turned
to
find
the
next
victim
for
his
axe,
he
spied
the
other
captain
across
the
deck.
His
white
surcoat
was
spotted
with
blood
and
gore,
but
Victarion
could
make
out
the
arms
upon
his
breast,
the
white
rose
within
its
red
escutcheon.
The
man
bore
the
same
device
upon
his
shield,
on
a
white
field
with
a
red
embattled
border.
“You!”
the
iron
captain
called
across
the
carnage.
“You
of
the
rose!
Be
you
the
lord
of
Southshield?”

The
other
raised
his
visor
to
show
a
beardless
face.
“His
son
and
heir.
Ser
Talbert
Serry.
And
who
are
you,
kraken?”

“Your
death.”
Victarion
bulled
toward
him.

Serry
leapt
to
meet
him.
His
longsword
was
good
castle-forged
steel,
and
the
young
knight
made
it
sing.
His
first
cut
was
low,
and
Victarion
deflected
it
off
his
axe.
His
second
caught
the
iron
captain
on
the
helm
before
he
got
his
shield
up.
Victarion
answered
with
a
sidearm
blow
of
his
axe.
Serry’s
shield
got
in
the
way.
Wooden
splinters
flew,
and
the
white
rose
split
lengthwise
with
a
sweet
sharp
crack.
The
young
knight’s
longsword
hammered
at
his
thigh,
once,
twice,
thrice,
screaming
against
the
steel.
This
boy
is
quick,
the
iron
captain
realized.
He
smashed
his
shield
in
Serry’s
face
and
sent
him
staggering
back
against
the
gunwale.
Victarion
raised
his
axe
and
put
all
his
weight
behind
his
cut,
to
open
the
boy
from
neck
to
groin,
but
Serry
spun
away.
The
axehead
crashed
through
the
rail,
sending
splinters
flying,
and
lodged
there
when
he
tried
to
pull
it
free.
The
deck
moved
under
his
feet,
and
he
stumbled
to
one
knee.

Ser
Talbert
cast
away
his
broken
shield
and
slashed
down
with
his
longsword.
Victarion’s
own
shield
had
twisted
half
around
when
he
stumbled.
He
caught
Serry’s
blade
in
an
iron
fist.
Lobstered
steel
crunched,
and
a
stab
of
pain
made
him
grunt,
yet
Victarion
held
on.
“I
am
quick
as
well,
boy,”
he
said
as
he
ripped
the
sword
from
the
knight’s
hand
and
flung
it
into
the
sea.

Ser
Talbert’s
eyes
went
wide.
“My
sword...”

Victarion
caught
the
lad
about
the
throat
with
a
bloody
fist.
“Go
and
get
it,”
he
said,
forcing
him
backwards
over
the
side
into
the
bloodstained
waters.

That
won
him
a
respite
to
pull
his
axe
loose.
The
white
roses
were
falling
back
before
the
iron
tide.
Some
tried
to
flee
belowdecks,
as
others
cried
for
quarter.
Victarion
could
feel
warm
blood
trickling
down
his
fingers
beneath
the
mail
and
leather
and
lobstered
plate,
but
that
was
nothing.
Around
the
mast
a
thick
knot
of
foemen
fought
on,
standing
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
a
ring.
These
few
are
men,
at
least.
They
would
sooner
die
than
yield.
Victarion
would
grant
some
of
them
that
wish.
He
beat
his
axe
against
his
shield
and
charged
them.

The
Drowned
God
had
not
shaped
Victarion
Greyjoy
to
fight
with
words
at
kingsmoots,
nor
struggle
against
furtive
sneaking
foes
in
endless
bogs.
This
was
why
he
had
been
put
on
earth;
to
stand
steel-clad
with
an
axe
red
and
dripping
in
his
hand,
dealing
death
with
every
blow.

They
hacked
at
him
from
front
and
back,
but
their
swords
might
have
been
willow
switches
for
all
the
harm
they
did
him.
No
blade
could
cut
through
Victarion
Greyjoy’s
heavy
plate,
nor
did
he
give
his
foes
the
time
to
find
the
weak
points
at
the
joints,
where
only
mail
and
leather
warded
him.
Let
three
men
assail
him,
or
four,
or
five;
it
made
no
matter.
He
slew
them
one
at
a
time,
trusting
in
his
steel
to
protect
him
from
the
others.
As
each
foe
fell
he
turned
his
wroth
upon
the
next.

The
last
man
to
face
him
must
have
been
a
smith;
he
had
shoulders
like
a
bull,
and
one
much
more
muscular
than
the
other.
His
armor
was
a
studded
brigandine
and
a
cap
of
boiled
leather.
The
only
blow
he
landed
completed
the
ruin
of
Victarion’s
shield,
but
the
cut
the
captain
dealt
in
answer
split
his
head
in
two.
Would
that
I
could
deal
with
the
Crow’s
Eye
as
simply.
When
he
jerked
his
axehead
free
again,
the
smith’s
skull
seemed
to
burst.
Bone
and
blood
and
brain
went
everywhere,
and
the
corpse
fell
forward,
up
against
his
legs.
Too
late
to
plead
for
quarter
now,
Victarion
thought
as
he
untangled
himself
from
the
dead
man.

By
then
the
deck
was
slick
beneath
his
feet,
and
the
dead
and
the
dying
lay
in
heaps
on
every
side.
He
threw
his
shield
away
and
sucked
in
air.
“Lord
Captain,”
he
heard
the
Barber
say
beside
him,
“the
day
is
ours.”

All
around
the
sea
was
full
of
ships.
Some
were
burning,
some
were
sinking,
some
had
been
smashed
to
splinters.
Between
the
hulls
the
water
was
thick
as
stew,
full
of
corpses,
broken
oars,
and
men
clinging
to
the
wreckage.
In
the
distance,
half
a
dozen
of
southron
longships
were
racing
back
toward
the
Mander.
Let
them
go,
Victarion
thought,
let
them
tell
the
tale.
Once
a
man
had
turned
his
tail
and
run
from
battle
he
ceased
to
be
a
man.

His
eyes
were
stinging
from
the
sweat
that
had
run
down
into
them
during
the
fight.
Two
of
his
oarsmen
helped
undo
his
kraken
helm
so
he
might
lift
it
off.
Victarion
mopped
at
his
brow.
“That
knight,”
he
grumbled,
“the
knight
of
the
white
rose.
Did
any
of
you
pull
him
out?”
A
lord’s
son
would
be
worth
a
goodly
ransom;
from
his
father,
if
Lord
Serry
had
survived
the
day.
From
his
liege
at
Highgarden,
if
not.

None
of
his
men
had
seen
what
became
of
the
knight
after
he
went
over
the
side,
however.
Most
like
the
man
had
drowned.
“May
he
feast
as
he
fought,
in
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls.”
Though
the
men
of
the
Shield
Islands
called
themselves
sailors,
they
crossed
the
seas
in
dread
and
went
lightly
clad
in
battle
for
fear
of
drowning.
Young
Serry
had
been
different.
A
brave
man,
thought
Victarion.
Almost
ironborn.

He
gave
the
captured
ship
to
Ragnor
Pyke,
named
a
dozen
men
to
crew
her,
and
clambered
back
up
onto
his
own
Iron
Victory.
“Strip
the
captives
of
arms
and
armor
and
have
their
wounds
bound
up,”
he
told
Nute
the
Barber.
“Throw
the
dying
in
the
sea.
If
any
beg
for
mercy,
cut
their
throats
first.”
He
had
only
contempt
for
such;
better
to
drown
on
seawater
than
on
blood.
“I
want
a
count
of
the
ships
we
won
and
all
the
knights
and
lordlings
we
took
captive.
I
want
their
banners
too.”
One
day
he
would
hang
them
in
his
hall,
so
when
he
grew
old
and
feeble
he
could
remember
all
the
foes
he
had
slain
when
he
was
young
and
strong.

“It
will
be
done.”
Nute
grinned.
“It
is
a
great
victory.”

Aye,
he
thought,
a
great
victory
for
the
Crow’s
Eye
and
his
wizards.
The
other
captains
would
shout
his
brother’s
name
anew
when
the
tidings
reached
Oakenshield.
Euron
had
seduced
them
with
his
glib
tongue
and
smiling
eye
and
bound
them
to
his
cause
with
the
plunder
of
half
a
hundred
distant
lands;
gold
and
silver,
ornate
armor,
curved
swords
with
gilded
pommels,
daggers
of
Valyrian
steel,
striped
tiger
pelts
and
the
skins
of
spotted
cats,
jade
manticores
and
ancient
Valyrian
sphinxes,
chests
of
nutmeg,
cloves,
and
saffron,
ivory
tusks
and
the
horns
of
unicorns,
green
and
orange
and
yellow
feathers
from
the
Summer
Sea,
bolts
of
fine
silk
and
shimmering
samite...
and
yet
all
that
was
little
and
less,
compared
to
this.
Now
he
has
given
them
conquest,
and
they
are
his
for
good
and
all,
the
captain
thought.
The
taste
was
bitter
on
his
tongue.
This
was
my
victory,
not
his.
Where
was
he?
Back
on
Oakenshield,
lazing
in
a
castle.
He
stole
my
wife
and
he
stole
my
throne,
and
now
he
steals
my
glory.

Obedience
came
naturally
to
Victarion
Greyjoy;
he
had
been
born
to
it.
Growing
to
manhood
in
the
shadow
of
his
brothers,
he
had
followed
Balon
dutifully
in
everything
he
did.
Later,
when
Balon’s
sons
were
born,
he
had
grown
to
accept
that
one
day
he
would
kneel
to
them
as
well,
when
one
of
them
took
his
father’s
place
upon
the
Seastone
Chair.
But
the
Drowned
God
had
summoned
Balon
and
his
sons
down
to
his
watery
halls,
and
Victarion
could
not
call
Euron
“king”
without
tasting
bile
in
his
throat.

The
wind
was
freshening,
and
his
thirst
was
raging.
After
a
battle
he
always
wanted
wine.
He
gave
the
deck
to
Nute
and
went
below.
In
his
cramped
cabin
aft,
he
found
the
dusky
woman
wet
and
ready;
perhaps
the
battle
had
warmed
her
blood
as
well.
He
took
her
twice,
in
quick
succession.
When
they
were
done
there
was
blood
smeared
across
her
breasts
and
thighs
and
belly,
but
it
was
his
blood,
from
the
gash
in
his
palm.
The
dusky
woman
washed
it
out
for
him
with
boiled
vinegar.

“The
plan
was
good,
I
grant
him,”
Victarion
said
as
she
knelt
beside
him.
“The
Mander
is
open
to
us
now,
as
it
was
of
old.”
It
was
a
lazy
river,
wide
and
slow
and
treacherous
with
snags
and
sandbars.
Most
seagoing
vessels
dared
not
sail
beyond
Highgarden,
but
longships
with
their
shallow
draughts
could
navigate
as
far
upstream
as
Bitterbridge.
In
ancient
days,
the
ironborn
had
boldly
sailed
the
river
road
and
plundered
all
along
the
Mander
and
its
vassal
streams...
until
the
kings
of
the
green
hand
had
armed
the
fisherfolk
on
the
four
small
islands
off
the
Mander’s
mouth
and
named
them
his
shields.

Two
thousand
years
had
passed,
but
in
the
watchtowers
along
their
craggy
shores,
greybeards
still
kept
the
ancient
vigil.
At
the
first
glimpse
of
longships
the
old
men
would
light
their
beacon
fires,
and
the
call
would
leap
from
hill
to
hill
and
island
to
island.
Fear!
Foes!
Raiders!
Raiders!
When
the
fisherfolk
saw
the
fires
burning
on
the
high
places
they
would
put
their
nets
and
plows
aside
and
take
up
their
swords
and
axes.
Their
lords
would
rush
from
their
castles,
attended
by
their
knights
and
men-at-arms.
Warhorns
would
echo
across
the
waters,
from
Greenshield
and
Greyshield,
Oakenshield
and
Southshield,
and
their
longships
would
come
sliding
out
from
moss-covered
stone
pens
along
the
shores,
oars
flashing
as
they
swarmed
across
the
straits
to
seal
the
Mander
and
hound
and
harry
the
raiders
upriver
to
their
doom.

Euron
had
sent
Torwold
Browntooth
and
the
Red
Oarsman
up
the
Mander
with
a
dozen
swift
longships,
so
the
lords
of
the
Shield
Islands
would
spill
forth
in
pursuit.
By
the
time
his
main
fleet
arrived,
only
a
handful
of
fighting
men
remained
to
defend
the
isles
themselves.
The
ironborn
had
come
in
on
the
evening
tide,
so
the
glare
of
the
setting
sun
would
keep
them
hidden
from
the
greybeards
in
the
watchtowers
until
it
was
too
late.
The
wind
was
at
their
backs,
as
it
had
been
all
the
way
down
from
Old
Wyk.
It
was
whispered
about
the
fleet
that
Euron’s
wizards
had
much
and
more
to
do
with
that,
that
the
Crow’s
Eye
appeased
the
Storm
God
with
blood
sacrifice.
How
else
would
he
have
dared
sail
so
far
to
the
west,
instead
of
following
the
shoreline
as
was
the
custom?

The
ironborn
ran
their
longships
up
onto
the
stony
shingles
and
spilled
out
into
the
purple
dusk
with
steel
glimmering
in
their
hands.
By
then
the
fires
were
burning
in
the
high
places,
but
few
remained
to
take
up
arms.
Greyshield,
Greenshield,
and
Southshield
fell
before
the
sun
came
up.
Oakenshield
lasted
half
a
day
longer.
And
when
the
men
of
the
Four
Shields
broke
off
their
pursuit
of
Torwold
and
the
Red
Oarsman
and
turned
downriver,
they
found
the
Iron
Fleet
waiting
at
the
Mander’s
mouth.

“All
fell
out
as
Euron
said
it
would,”
Victarion
told
the
dusky
woman
as
she
bound
up
his
hand
with
linen.
“His
wizards
must
have
seen
it.”
He
had
three
aboard
the
Silence,
Quellon
Humble
had
confided
in
a
whisper.
Queer
men
and
terrible,
they
were,
but
the
Crow’s
Eye
had
made
them
slaves.
“He
still
needs
me
to
fight
his
battles,
though,”
Victarion
insisted.
“Wizards
may
be
well
and
good,
but
blood
and
steel
win
wars.”
The
vinegar
made
his
wound
hurt
worse
than
ever.
He
shoved
the
woman
away
and
closed
his
fist,
glowering.
“Bring
me
wine.”

He
drank
in
the
darkness,
brooding
on
his
brother.
If
I
do
not
strike
the
blow
with
mine
own
hand,
am
I
still
a
kinslayer?
Victarion
feared
no
man,
but
the
Drowned
God’s
curse
gave
him
pause.
If
another
strikes
him
down
at
my
command,
will
his
blood
still
stain
my
hands?
Aeron
Damphair
would
know
the
answer,
but
the
priest
was
somewhere
back
on
the
Iron
Islands,
still
hoping
to
raise
the
ironborn
against
their
new-crowned
king.
Nute
the
Barber
can
shave
a
man
with
a
thrown
axe
from
twenty
yards
away.
And
none
of
Euron’s
mongrels
could
stand
against
Wulfe
One-Ear
or
Andrik
the
Unsmiling.
Any
of
them
could
do
it.
But
what
a
man
can
do
and
what
a
man
will
do
are
two
different
things,
he
knew.

“Euron’s
blasphemies
will
bring
down
the
Drowned
God’s
wroth
upon
us
all,”
Aeron
had
prophesied,
back
on
Old
Wyk.
“We
must
stop
him,
brother.
We
are
still
of
Balon’s
blood,
are
we
not?”

“So
is
he,”
Victarion
had
said.
“I
like
it
no
more
than
you,
but
Euron
is
the
king.
Your
kingsmoot
raised
him
up,
and
you
put
the
driftwood
crown
upon
his
head
yourself!”

“I
placed
the
crown
upon
his
head,”
said
the
priest,
seaweed
dripping
in
his
hair,
“and
gladly
will
I
wrest
it
off
again
and
crown
you
in
his
stead.
Only
you
are
strong
enough
to
fight
him.”

“The
Drowned
God
raised
him
up,”
Victarion
complained.
“Let
the
Drowned
God
cast
him
down.”

Aeron
gave
him
a
baleful
look,
the
look
that
had
been
known
to
sour
wells
and
make
women
barren.
“It
was
not
the
god
who
spoke.
Euron
is
known
to
keep
wizards
and
foul
sorcerers
on
that
red
ship
of
his.
They
sent
some
spell
among
us,
so
we
could
not
hear
the
sea.
The
captains
and
the
kings
were
drunk
with
all
this
talk
of
dragons.”

“Drunk,
and
fearful
of
that
horn.
You
heard
the
sound
it
made.
It
makes
no
matter.
Euron
is
our
king.”

“Not
mine,”
the
priest
declared.
“The
Drowned
God
helps
bold
men,
not
those
who
cower
below
their
decks
when
the
storm
is
rising.
If
you
will
not
bestir
yourself
to
remove
the
Crow’s
Eye
from
the
Seastone
Chair,
I
must
take
the
task
upon
myself.”

“How?
You
have
no
ships,
no
swords.”

“I
have
my
voice,”
the
priest
replied,
“and
the
god
is
with
me.
Mine
is
the
strength
of
the
sea,
a
strength
the
Crow’s
Eye
cannot
hope
to
withstand.
The
waves
may
break
upon
the
mountain,
yet
still
they
come,
wave
upon
wave,
and
in
the
end
only
pebbles
remain
where
once
the
mountain
stood.
And
soon
even
the
pebbles
are
swept
away,
to
be
ground
beneath
the
sea
for
all
eternity.”

“Pebbles?”
Victarion
grumbled.
“You
are
mad
if
you
think
to
bring
the
Crow’s
Eye
down
with
talk
of
waves
and
pebbles.”

“The
ironborn
shall
be
waves,”
the
Damphair
said.
“Not
the
great
and
lordly,
but
the
simple
folk,
tillers
of
the
soil
and
fishers
of
the
sea.
The
captains
and
the
kings
raised
Euron
up,
but
the
common
folk
shall
tear
him
down.
I
shall
go
to
Great
Wyk,
to
Harlaw,
to
Orkmont,
to
Pyke
itself.
In
every
town
and
village
shall
my
words
be
heard.
No
godless
man
may
sit
the
Seastone
Chair!”
He
shook
his
shaggy
head
and
stalked
back
out
into
the
night.
When
the
sun
came
up
the
next
day,
Aeron
Greyjoy
had
vanished
from
Old
Wyk.
Even
his
drowned
men
knew
not
where.
They
said
the
Crow’s
Eye
only
laughed
when
he
was
told.

But
though
the
priest
was
gone,
his
dire
warnings
lingered.
Victarion
found
himself
remembering
Baelor
Blacktyde’s
words
as
well.
“Balon
was
mad,
Aeron
is
madder,
and
Euron
is
maddest
of
them
all.”
The
young
lord
had
tried
to
sail
home
after
the
kingsmoot,
refusing
to
accept
Euron
as
his
liege.
But
the
Iron
Fleet
had
closed
the
bay,
the
habit
of
obedience
was
rooted
deep
in
Victarion
Greyjoy,
and
Euron
wore
the
driftwood
crown.
Nightflyer
was
seized,
Lord
Blacktyde
delivered
to
the
king
in
chains.
Euron’s
mutes
and
mongrels
had
cut
him
into
seven
parts,
to
feed
the
seven
green
land
gods
he
worshiped.

As
a
reward
for
his
leal
service,
the
new-crowned
king
had
given
Victarion
the
dusky
woman,
taken
off
some
slaver
bound
for
Lys.
“I
want
none
of
your
leavings,”
he
had
told
his
brother
scornfully,
but
when
the
Crow’s
Eye
said
that
the
woman
would
be
killed
unless
he
took
her,
he
had
weakened.
Her
tongue
had
been
torn
out,
but
elsewise
she
was
undamaged,
and
beautiful
besides,
with
skin
as
brown
as
oiled
teak.
Yet
sometimes
when
he
looked
at
her,
he
found
himself
remembering
the
first
woman
his
brother
had
given
him,
to
make
a
man
of
him.

Victarion
wanted
to
use
the
dusky
woman
once
again,
but
found
himself
unable.
“Fetch
me
another
skin
of
wine,”
he
told
her,
“then
get
out.”
When
she
returned
with
a
skin
of
sour
red,
the
captain
took
it
up
on
deck,
where
he
could
breathe
the
clean
sea
air.
He
drank
half
the
skin
and
poured
the
rest
into
the
sea
for
all
the
men
who’d
died.

The
Iron
Victory
lingered
for
hours
off
the
mouth
of
the
Mander.
As
the
greater
part
of
the
Iron
Fleet
got
under
way
for
Oakenshield,
Victarion
kept
Grief,
Lord
Dagon,
Iron
Wind,
and
Maiden’s
Bane
about
him
as
a
rear
guard.
They
pulled
survivors
from
the
sea,
and
watched
Hardhand
sink
slowly,
dragged
under
by
the
wreck
that
she
had
rammed.
By
the
time
she
vanished
beneath
the
waters
Victarion
had
the
count
he’d
asked
for.
He
had
lost
six
ships,
and
captured
eight-and-thirty.
“It
will
serve,”
he
told
Nute.
“To
the
oars.
We
return
to
Lord
Hewett’s
Town.”

His
oarsmen
bent
their
backs
toward
Oakenshield,
and
the
iron
captain
went
belowdecks
once
again.
“I
could
kill
him,”
he
told
the
dusky
woman.
“Though
it
is
a
great
sin
to
kill
your
king,
and
a
worse
one
to
kill
your
brother.”
He
frowned.
“Asha
should
have
given
me
her
voice.”
How
could
she
have
ever
hoped
to
win
the
captains
and
the
kings,
her
with
her
pinecones
and
her
turnips?
Balon’s
blood
is
in
her,
but
she
is
still
a
woman.
She
had
run
after
the
kingsmoot.
The
night
the
driftwood
crown
was
placed
on
Euron’s
head,
she
and
her
crew
had
melted
away.
Some
small
part
of
Victarion
was
glad
she
had.
If
the
girl
keeps
her
wits
about
her,
she
will
wed
some
northern
lord
and
live
with
him
in
his
castle,
far
from
the
sea
and
Euron
Crow’s
Eye.

“Lord
Hewett’s
Town,
Lord
Captain,”
a
crewman
called.

Victarion
rose.
The
wine
had
dulled
the
throbbing
in
his
hand.
Perhaps
he
would
have
Hewett’s
maester
look
at
it,
if
the
man
had
not
been
killed.
He
returned
to
deck
as
they
came
around
a
headland.
The
way
Lord
Hewett’s
castle
sat
above
the
harbor
reminded
him
of
Lordsport,
though
this
town
was
twice
as
big.
A
score
of
longships
prowled
the
waters
beyond
the
port,
the
golden
kraken
writhing
on
their
sails.
Hundreds
more
were
beached
along
the
shingles
and
drawn
up
to
the
piers
that
lined
the
harbor.
At
a
stone
quay
stood
three
great
cogs
and
a
dozen
smaller
ones,
taking
on
plunder
and
provisions.
Victarion
gave
orders
for
the
Iron
Victory
to
drop
anchor.
“Have
a
boat
made
ready.”

The
town
seemed
strangely
still
as
they
approached.
Most
of
the
shops
and
houses
had
been
looted,
as
their
smashed
doors
and
broken
shutters
testified,
but
only
the
sept
had
been
put
to
the
torch.
The
streets
were
strewn
with
corpses,
each
with
a
small
flock
of
carrion
crows
in
attendance.
A
gang
of
sullen
survivors
moved
amongst
them,
chasing
off
the
black
birds
and
tossing
the
dead
into
the
back
of
a
wagon
for
burial.
The
notion
filled
Victarion
with
disgust.
No
true
son
of
the
sea
would
want
to
rot
beneath
the
ground.
How
would
he
ever
find
the
Drowned
God’s
watery
halls,
to
drink
and
feast
for
all
eternity?

The
Silence
was
amongst
the
ships
they
passed.
Victarion’s
gaze
was
drawn
to
the
iron
figurehead
at
her
prow,
the
mouthless
maiden
with
the
windblown
hair
and
outstretched
arm.
Her
mother-of-pearl
eyes
seemed
to
follow
him.
She
had
a
mouth
like
any
other
woman,
till
the
Crow’s
Eye
sewed
it
shut.

As
they
neared
the
shore,
he
noticed
a
line
of
women
and
children
herded
up
onto
the
deck
of
one
of
the
great
cogs.
Some
had
their
hands
bound
behind
their
backs,
and
all
wore
loops
of
hempen
rope
about
their
necks.
“Who
are
they?”
he
asked
the
men
who
helped
tie
up
their
boat.

“Widows
and
orphans.
They’re
to
be
sold
as
slaves.”

“Sold?”
There
were
no
slaves
in
the
Iron
Islands,
only
thralls.
A
thrall
was
bound
to
service,
but
he
was
not
chattel.
His
children
were
born
free,
so
long
as
they
were
given
to
the
Drowned
God.
And
thralls
were
never
bought
nor
sold
for
gold.
A
man
paid
the
iron
price
for
thralls,
or
else
had
none.
“They
should
be
thralls,
or
salt
wives,”
Victarion
complained.

“It’s
by
the
king’s
decree,”
the
man
said.

“The
strong
have
always
taken
from
the
weak,”
said
Nute
the
Barber.
“Thralls
or
slaves,
it
makes
no
matter.
Their
men
could
not
defend
them,
so
now
they
are
ours,
to
do
with
as
we
will.”

It
is
not
the
Old
Way,
he
might
have
said,
but
there
was
no
time.
His
victory
had
preceded
him,
and
men
were
gathering
round
to
offer
congratulations.
Victarion
let
them
fawn,
until
one
began
to
praise
Euron’s
daring.
“It
is
daring
to
sail
out
of
sight
of
land,
so
no
word
of
our
coming
could
reach
these
islands
before
us,”
he
growled,
“but
crossing
half
the
world
to
hunt
for
dragons,
that
is
something
else.”
He
did
not
wait
for
a
reply,
but
shouldered
through
the
press
and
on
up
to
the
keep.

Lord
Hewett’s
castle
was
small
but
strong,
with
thick
walls
and
studded
oaken
gates
that
evoked
his
House’s
ancient
arms,
an
oak
escutcheon
studded
with
iron
upon
a
field
of
undy
blue
and
white.
But
it
was
the
kraken
of
House
Greyjoy
that
flew
atop
his
green-roofed
towers
now,
and
they
found
the
great
gates
burned
and
broken.
On
the
ramparts
walked
ironborn
with
spears
and
axes,
and
some
of
Euron’s
mongrels
too.

In
the
yard
Victarion
came
on
Gorold
Goodbrother
and
old
Drumm,
speaking
quietly
with
Rodrik
Harlaw.
Nute
the
Barber
gave
a
hoot
at
the
sight
of
them.
“Reader,”
he
called
out,
“why
is
your
face
so
long?
Your
misgivings
were
for
nought.
The
day
is
ours,
and
ours
the
prize!”

Lord
Rodrik’s
mouth
puckered.
“These
rocks,
you
mean?
All
four
together
wouldn’t
make
Harlaw.
We
have
won
some
stones
and
trees
and
trinkets,
and
the
enmity
of
House
Tyrell.”

“The
roses?”
Nute
laughed.
“What
rose
can
harm
the
krakens
of
the
deep?
We
have
taken
their
shields
from
them,
and
smashed
them
all
to
pieces.
Who
will
protect
them
now?”

“Highgarden,”
replied
the
Reader.
“Soon
enough
all
the
power
of
the
Reach
will
be
marshaled
against
us,
Barber,
and
then
you
may
learn
that
some
roses
have
steel
thorns.”

Drumm
nodded,
one
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
Red
Rain.
“Lord
Tarly
bears
the
greatsword
Heartsbane,
forged
of
Valyrian
steel,
and
he
is
always
in
Lord
Tyrell’s
van.”

Victarion’s
hunger
flared.
“Let
him
come.
I
will
take
his
sword
for
mine
own,
as
your
own
forebear
took
Red
Rain.
Let
them
all
come,
and
bring
the
Lannisters
as
well.
A
lion
may
be
fierce
enough
on
land,
but
at
sea
the
kraken
rules
supreme.”
He
would
give
half
his
teeth
for
the
chance
to
try
his
axe
against
the
Kingslayer
or
the
Knight
of
Flowers.
That
was
the
sort
of
battle
that
he
understood.
The
kinslayer
was
accursed
in
the
eyes
of
gods
and
men,
but
the
warrior
was
honored
and
revered.

“Have
no
fear,
Lord
Captain,”
said
the
Reader.
“They
will
come.
His
Grace
desires
it.
Why
else
would
he
have
commanded
us
to
let
Hewett’s
ravens
fly?”

“You
read
too
much
and
fight
too
little,”
Nute
said.
“Your
blood
is
milk.”
But
the
Reader
made
as
if
he
had
not
heard.

A
riotous
feast
was
in
progress
when
Victarion
entered
the
hall.
Ironborn
filled
the
tables,
drinking
and
shouting
and
jostling
each
other,
boasting
of
the
men
that
they
had
slain,
the
deeds
that
they
had
done,
the
prizes
they
had
won.
Many
were
bedecked
with
plunder.
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd
and
Quellon
Humble
had
torn
tapestries
off
the
walls
to
serve
as
cloaks.
Germund
Botley
wore
a
rope
of
pearls
and
garnets
over
his
gilded
Lannister
breastplate.
Andrik
the
Unsmiling
staggered
by
with
a
woman
under
each
arm;
though
he
remained
unsmiling,
he
had
rings
on
every
finger.
Instead
of
trenchers
carved
from
old
stale
bread,
the
captains
were
eating
off
solid
silver
platters.

Nute
the
Barber’s
face
grew
dark
with
anger
as
he
looked
about.
“The
Crow’s
Eye
sends
us
forth
to
face
the
longships,
whilst
his
own
men
take
the
castles
and
the
villages
and
grab
all
the
loot
and
women.
What
has
he
left
for
us?”

“We
have
the
glory.”

“Glory
is
good,”
said
Nute,
“but
gold
is
better.”

Victarion
shrugged.
“The
Crow’s
Eye
says
we
shall
have
all
of
Westeros.
The
Arbor,
Oldtown,
Highgarden...
that’s
where
you’ll
find
your
gold.
But
enough
talk.
I’m
hungry.”

By
right
of
blood
Victarion
might
have
claimed
a
seat
on
the
dais,
but
he
did
not
care
to
eat
with
Euron
and
his
creatures.
Instead,
he
chose
a
place
by
Ralf
the
Limper,
the
captain
of
the
Lord
Quellon.
“A
great
victory,
Lord
Captain,”
said
the
Limper.
“A
victory
worthy
of
a
lordship.
You
should
have
an
island.”

Lord
Victarion.
Aye,
and
why
not?
It
might
not
be
the
Seastone
Chair,
but
it
would
be
something.

Hotho
Harlaw
was
across
the
table,
sucking
meat
off
a
bone.
He
flicked
it
aside
and
hunched
forward.
“The
Knight’s
to
have
Greyshield.
My
cousin.
Did
you
hear?”

“No.”
Victarion
looked
across
the
hall,
to
where
Ser
Harras
Harlaw
sat
drinking
wine
from
a
golden
cup;
a
tall
man,
long-faced
and
austere.
“Why
would
Euron
give
that
one
an
island?”

Hotho
held
out
his
empty
wine
cup,
and
a
pale
young
woman
in
a
gown
of
blue
velvet
and
gilt
lace
refilled
it
for
him.
“The
Knight
took
Grimston
by
himself.
He
planted
his
standard
beneath
the
castle
and
defied
the
Grimms
to
face
him.
One
did,
and
then
another,
and
another.
He
slew
them
all...
well,
near
enough,
two
yielded.
When
the
seventh
man
went
down,
Lord
Grimm’s
septon
decided
the
gods
had
spoken
and
surrendered
the
castle.”
Hotho
laughed.
“He’ll
be
the
Lord
of
Greyshield,
and
welcome
to
it.
With
him
gone,
I
am
the
Reader’s
heir.”
He
thumped
his
wine
cup
against
his
chest.
“Hotho
the
Humpback,
Lord
of
Harlaw.”

“Seven,
you
say.”
Victarion
wondered
how
Nightfall
would
fare
against
his
axe.
He
had
never
fought
a
man
armed
with
a
Valyrian
steel
blade,
though
he
had
thrashed
young
Harras
Harlaw
many
a
time
when
both
of
them
were
young.
As
a
boy
Harlaw
had
been
fast
friends
with
Balon’s
eldest
son,
Rodrik,
who
had
died
beneath
the
walls
of
Seagard.

The
feast
was
good.
The
wine
was
of
the
best,
and
there
was
roast
ox,
rare
and
bloody,
and
stuffed
ducks
as
well,
and
buckets
of
fresh
crabs.
The
serving
wenches
wore
fine
woolens
and
plush
velvets,
the
Lord
Captain
did
not
fail
to
note.
He
took
them
for
scullions
dressed
up
in
the
clothes
of
Lady
Hewett
and
her
ladies,
until
Hotho
told
him
they
were
Lady
Hewett
and
her
ladies.
It
amused
the
Crow’s
Eye
to
make
them
wait
and
pour.
There
were
eight
of
them:
her
ladyship
herself,
still
handsome
though
grown
somewhat
stout,
and
seven
younger
women
aged
from
twenty-five
to
ten,
her
daughters
and
good-daughters.

Lord
Hewett
himself
sat
in
his
accustomed
place
upon
the
dais,
dressed
in
all
his
heraldic
finery.
His
arms
and
legs
had
been
tied
to
his
chair,
and
a
huge
white
radish
shoved
between
his
teeth
so
he
could
not
speak...
though
he
could
see
and
hear.
The
Crow’s
Eye
had
claimed
the
place
of
honor
at
his
lordship’s
right
hand.
A
pretty,
buxom
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
was
in
his
lap,
barefoot
and
disheveled,
her
arms
around
his
neck.
“Who
is
that?”
Victarion
asked
the
men
around
him.

“His
lordship’s
bastard
daughter,”
laughed
Hotho.
“Before
Euron
took
the
castle,
she
was
made
to
wait
at
table
on
the
rest
and
take
her
own
meals
with
the
servants.”

Euron
put
his
blue
lips
to
her
throat,
and
the
girl
giggled
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear.
Smiling,
he
kissed
her
throat
again.
Her
white
skin
was
covered
with
red
marks
where
his
mouth
had
been;
they
made
a
rosy
necklace
about
her
neck
and
shoulders.
Another
whisper
in
his
ear,
and
this
time
the
Crow’s
Eye
laughed
aloud,
then
slammed
his
wine
cup
down
for
silence.
“Good
ladies,”
he
called
out
to
his
highborn
serving
women,
“Falia
is
concerned
for
your
fine
gowns.
She
would
not
have
them
stained
with
grease
and
wine
and
dirty
groping
fingers,
since
I
have
promised
that
she
may
choose
her
own
clothes
from
your
wardrobes
after
the
feast.
So
you
had
best
disrobe.”

A
roar
of
laughter
washed
over
the
great
hall,
and
Lord
Hewett’s
face
turned
so
red
that
Victarion
thought
his
head
might
burst.
The
women
had
no
choice
but
to
obey.
The
youngest
one
cried
a
little,
but
her
mother
comforted
her
and
helped
undo
the
laces
down
her
back.
Afterward,
they
continued
to
serve
as
before,
moving
along
the
tables
with
flagons
full
of
wine
to
fill
each
empty
cup,
only
now
they
did
so
naked.

He
shames
Hewett
as
he
once
shamed
me,
the
captain
thought,
remembering
how
his
wife
had
sobbed
as
he
was
beating
her.
The
men
of
the
Four
Shields
oft
married
one
another,
he
knew,
just
as
the
ironborn
did.
One
of
these
naked
serving
wenches
might
well
be
Ser
Talbert
Serry’s
wife.
It
was
one
thing
to
kill
a
foe,
another
to
dishonor
him.
Victarion
made
a
fist.
His
hand
was
bloody
where
his
wound
had
soaked
through
the
linen.

On
the
dais,
Euron
pushed
aside
his
slattern
and
climbed
upon
the
table.
The
captains
began
to
bang
their
cups
and
stamp
their
feet
upon
the
floor.
“EURON!”
they
shouted.
“EURON!
EURON!
EURON!”
It
was
kingsmoot
come
again.

“I
swore
to
give
you
Westeros,”
the
Crow’s
Eye
said
when
the
tumult
died
away,
“and
here
is
your
first
taste.
A
morsel,
nothing
more...
but
we
shall
feast
before
the
fall
of
night!”
The
torches
along
the
walls
were
burning
bright,
and
so
was
he,
blue
lips,
blue
eye,
and
all.
“What
the
kraken
grasps
it
does
not
loose.
These
isles
were
once
ours,
and
now
they
are
again...
but
we
need
strong
men
to
hold
them.
So
rise,
Ser
Harras
Harlaw,
Lord
of
Greyshield.”
The
Knight
stood,
one
hand
upon
Nightfall’s
moonstone
pommel.
“Rise,
Andrik
the
Unsmiling,
Lord
of
Southshield.”
Andrik
shoved
away
his
women
and
lurched
to
his
feet,
like
a
mountain
rising
sudden
from
the
sea.
“Rise,
Maron
Volmark,
Lord
of
Greenshield.”
A
beardless
boy
of
six-and-ten
years,
Volmark
stood
hesitantly,
looking
like
the
lord
of
rabbits.
“And
rise,
Nute
the
Barber,
Lord
of
Oakenshield.”

Nute’s
eyes
grew
wary,
as
if
he
feared
he
was
the
butt
of
some
cruel
jape.
“A
lord?”
he
croaked.

Victarion
had
expected
the
Crow’s
Eye
to
give
the
lordships
to
his
own
creatures,
Stonehand
and
the
Red
Oarsman
and
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd.
A
king
must
needs
be
open-handed,
he
tried
to
tell
himself,
but
another
voice
whispered,
Euron’s
gifts
are
poisoned.
When
he
turned
it
over
in
his
head,
he
saw
it
plain.
The
Knight
was
the
Reader’s
chosen
heir,
and
Andrik
the
Unsmiling
the
strong
right
arm
of
Dunstan
Drumm.
Volmark
is
a
callow
boy,
but
he
has
Black
Harren’s
blood
in
him
through
his
mother.
And
the
Barber...

Victarion
grabbed
him
by
the
forearm.
“Refuse
him!”

Nute
looked
at
him
as
if
he
had
gone
mad.
“Refuse
him?
Lands
and
lordship?
Will
you
make
me
a
lord?”
He
wrenched
his
arm
away
and
stood,
basking
in
the
cheers.

And
now
he
steals
my
men
away,
Victarion
thought.

King
Euron
called
to
Lady
Hewett
for
a
fresh
cup
of
wine
and
raised
it
high
above
his
head.
“Captains
and
kings,
lift
your
cups
to
the
Lords
of
the
Four
Shields!”
Victarion
drank
with
the
rest.
There
is
no
wine
so
sweet
as
wine
taken
from
a
foe.
Someone
had
told
him
that
once.
His
father,
or
his
brother
Balon.
One
day
I
shall
drink
your
wine,
Crow’s
Eye,
and
take
from
you
all
that
you
hold
dear.
But
was
there
anything
Euron
held
dear?

“On
the
morrow
we
prepare
once
more
to
sail,”
the
king
was
saying.
“Fill
our
casks
anew
with
spring
water,
take
every
sack
of
grain
and
cask
of
beef,
and
as
many
sheep
and
goats
as
we
can
carry.
The
wounded
who
are
still
hale
enough
to
pull
an
oar
will
row.
The
rest
shall
remain
here,
to
help
hold
these
isles
for
their
new
lords.
Torwold
and
the
Red
Oarsman
will
soon
be
back
with
more
provisions.
Our
decks
will
stink
of
pigs
and
chickens
on
the
voyage
east,
but
we’ll
return
with
dragons.”

“When?”
The
voice
was
Lord
Rodrik’s.
“When
shall
we
return,
Your
Grace?
A
year?
Three
years?
Five?
Your
dragons
are
a
world
away,
and
autumn
is
upon
us.”
The
Reader
walked
forward,
sounding
all
the
hazards.
“Galleys
guard
the
Redwyne
Straits.
The
Dornish
coast
is
dry
and
bleak,
four
hundred
leagues
of
whirlpools,
cliffs,
and
hidden
shoals
with
hardly
a
safe
landing
anywhere.
Beyond
wait
the
Stepstones,
with
their
storms
and
their
nests
of
Lysene
and
Myrish
pirates.
If
a
thousand
ships
set
sail,
three
hundred
may
reach
the
far
side
of
the
narrow
sea...
and
then
what?
Lys
will
not
welcome
us,
nor
will
Volantis.
Where
will
you
find
fresh
water,
food?
The
first
storm
will
scatter
us
across
half
the
earth.”

A
smile
played
across
Euron’s
blue
lips.
“I
am
the
storm,
my
lord.
The
first
storm,
and
the
last.
I
have
taken
the
Silence
on
longer
voyages
than
this,
and
ones
far
more
hazardous.
Have
you
forgotten?
I
have
sailed
the
Smoking
Sea
and
seen
Valyria.”

Every
man
there
knew
that
the
Doom
still
ruled
Valyria.
The
very
sea
there
boiled
and
smoked,
and
the
land
was
overrun
with
demons.
It
was
said
that
any
sailor
who
so
much
as
glimpsed
the
fiery
mountains
of
Valyria
rising
above
the
waves
would
soon
die
a
dreadful
death,
yet
the
Crow’s
Eye
had
been
there,
and
returned.

“Have
you?”
the
Reader
asked,
so
softly.

Euron’s
blue
smile
vanished.
“Reader,”
he
said
into
the
quiet,
“you
would
do
well
to
keep
your
nose
in
your
books.”

Victarion
could
feel
the
unease
in
the
hall.
He
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
“Brother,”
he
boomed.
“You
have
not
answered
Harlaw’s
questions.”

Euron
shrugged.
“The
price
of
slaves
is
rising.
We
will
sell
our
slaves
in
Lys
and
Volantis.
That,
and
the
plunder
we
have
taken
here,
will
give
us
sufficient
gold
to
buy
provisions.”

“Are
we
slavers
now?”
asked
the
Reader.
“And
for
what?
Dragons
that
no
man
here
has
seen?
Shall
we
chase
some
drunken
sailor’s
fancy
to
the
far
ends
of
the
earth?”

His
words
drew
mutters
of
assent.
“Slaver’s
Bay
is
too
far,”
called
out
Ralf
the
Limper.
“And
too
close
to
Valyria,”
shouted
Quellon
Humble.
Fralegg
the
Strong
said,
“Highgarden’s
close.
I
say,
look
for
dragons
there.
The
golden
kind!”
Alvyn
Sharp
said,
“Why
sail
the
world,
when
the
Mander
lies
before
us?”
Red
Ralf
Stonehouse
bounded
to
his
feet.
“Oldtown
is
richer,
and
the
Arbor
richer
still.
Redwyne’s
fleet
is
off
away.
We
need
only
reach
out
our
hand
to
pluck
the
ripest
fruit
in
Westeros.”

“Fruit?”
The
king’s
eye
looked
more
black
than
blue.
“Only
a
craven
would
steal
a
fruit
when
he
could
take
the
orchard.”

“It
is
the
Arbor
we
want,”
said
Red
Ralf,
and
other
men
took
up
the
cry.
The
Crow’s
Eye
let
the
shouts
wash
over
him.
Then
he
leapt
down
from
the
table,
grabbed
his
slattern
by
the
arm,
and
pulled
her
from
the
hall.

Fled,
like
a
dog.
Euron’s
hold
upon
the
Seastone
Chair
suddenly
did
not
seem
as
secure
as
it
had
a
few
moments
before.
They
will
not
follow
him
to
Slaver’s
Bay.
Perhaps
they
are
not
such
dogs
and
fools
as
I
had
feared.
That
was
such
a
merry
thought
that
Victarion
had
to
wash
it
down.
He
drained
a
cup
with
the
Barber,
to
show
him
that
he
did
not
begrudge
him
his
lordship,
even
if
it
came
from
Euron’s
hand.

Outside
the
sun
went
down.
Darkness
gathered
beyond
the
walls,
but
inside
the
torches
burned
with
a
ruddy
orange
glow,
and
their
smoke
gathered
under
the
rafters
like
a
grey
cloud.
Drunken
men
began
to
dance
the
finger
dance.
At
some
point
Left-Hand
Lucas
Codd
decided
he
wanted
one
of
Lord
Hewett’s
daughters,
so
he
took
her
on
a
table
whilst
her
sisters
screamed
and
sobbed.

Victarion
felt
a
tap
upon
his
shoulder.
One
of
Euron’s
mongrel
sons
stood
behind
him,
a
boy
of
ten
with
woolly
hair
and
skin
the
color
of
mud.
“My
father
wishes
words
with
you.”

Victarion
rose
unsteadily.
He
was
a
big
man,
with
a
large
capacity
for
wine,
but
even
so,
he
had
drunk
too
much.
I
beat
her
to
death
with
mine
own
hands,
he
thought,
but
the
Crow’s
Eye
killed
her
when
he
shoved
himself
inside
her.
I
had
no
choice.
He
followed
the
bastard
boy
from
the
hall
and
up
a
winding
stone
stair.
The
sounds
of
rape
and
revelry
diminished
as
they
climbed,
until
there
was
only
the
soft
scrape
of
boots
on
stone.

The
Crow’s
Eye
had
taken
Lord
Hewett’s
bedchamber
along
with
his
bastard
daughter.
When
he
entered,
the
girl
was
sprawled
naked
on
the
bed,
snoring
softly.
Euron
stood
by
the
window,
drinking
from
a
silver
cup.
He
wore
the
sable
cloak
he
took
from
Blacktyde,
his
red
leather
eye
patch,
and
nothing
else.
“When
I
was
a
boy,
I
dreamt
that
I
could
fly,”
he
announced.
“When
I
woke,
I
couldn’t...
or
so
the
maester
said.
But
what
if
he
lied?”

Victarion
could
smell
the
sea
through
the
open
window,
though
the
room
stank
of
wine
and
blood
and
sex.
The
cold
salt
air
helped
to
clear
his
head.
“What
do
you
mean?”

Euron
turned
to
face
him,
his
bruised
blue
lips
curled
in
a
half
smile.
“Perhaps
we
can
fly.
All
of
us.
How
will
we
ever
know
unless
we
leap
from
some
tall
tower?”
The
wind
came
gusting
through
the
window
and
stirred
his
sable
cloak.
There
was
something
obscene
and
disturbing
about
his
nakedness.
“No
man
ever
truly
knows
what
he
can
do
unless
he
dares
to
leap.”

“There
is
the
window.
Leap.”
Victarion
had
no
patience
for
this.
His
wounded
hand
was
troubling
him.
“What
do
you
want?”

“The
world.”
Firelight
glimmered
in
Euron’s
eye.
His
smiling
eye.
“Will
you
take
a
cup
of
Lord
Hewett’s
wine?
There’s
no
wine
half
so
sweet
as
wine
taken
from
a
beaten
foe.”

“No.”
Victarion
glanced
away.
“Cover
yourself.”

Euron
seated
himself
and
gave
his
cloak
a
twitch,
so
it
covered
his
private
parts.
“I
had
forgotten
what
a
small
and
noisy
folk
they
are,
my
ironborn.
I
would
bring
them
dragons,
and
they
shout
out
for
grapes.”

“Grapes
are
real.
A
man
can
gorge
himself
on
grapes.
Their
juice
is
sweet,
and
they
make
wine.
What
do
dragons
make?”

“Woe.”
The
Crow’s
Eye
sipped
from
his
silver
cup.
“I
once
held
a
dragon’s
egg
in
this
hand,
brother.
This
Myrish
wizard
swore
he
could
hatch
it
if
I
gave
him
a
year
and
all
the
gold
that
he
required.
When
I
grew
bored
with
his
excuses,
I
slew
him.
As
he
watched
his
entrails
sliding
through
his
fingers
he
said,
‘But
it
has
not
been
a
year.’”
He
laughed.
“Cragorn’s
died,
you
know.”

“Who?”

“The
man
who
blew
my
dragon
horn.
When
the
maester
cut
him
open,
his
lungs
were
charred
as
black
as
soot.”

Victarion
shuddered.
“Show
me
this
dragon’s
egg.”

“I
threw
it
in
the
sea
during
one
of
my
dark
moods.”
Euron
gave
a
shrug.
“It
comes
to
me
that
the
Reader
was
not
wrong.
Too
large
a
fleet
could
never
hold
together
over
such
a
distance.
The
voyage
is
too
long,
too
perilous.
Only
our
finest
ships
and
crews
could
hope
to
sail
to
Slaver’s
Bay
and
back.
The
Iron
Fleet.”

The
Iron
Fleet
is
mine,
Victarion
thought.
He
said
nothing.

The
Crow’s
Eye
filled
two
cups
with
a
strange
black
wine
that
flowed
as
thick
as
honey.
“Drink
with
me,
brother.
Have
a
taste
of
this.”
He
offered
one
of
the
cups
to
Victarion.

The
captain
took
the
cup
Euron
had
not
offered,
sniffed
at
its
contents
suspiciously.
Seen
up
close,
it
looked
more
blue
than
black.
It
was
thick
and
oily,
with
a
smell
like
rotted
flesh.
He
tried
a
small
swallow,
and
spit
it
out
at
once.
“Foul
stuff.
Do
you
mean
to
poison
me?”

“I
mean
to
open
your
eyes.”
Euron
drank
deep
from
his
own
cup,
and
smiled.
“Shade-of-the-evening,
the
wine
of
the
warlocks.
I
came
upon
a
cask
of
it
when
I
captured
a
certain
galleas
out
of
Qarth,
along
with
some
cloves
and
nutmeg,
forty
bolts
of
green
silk,
and
four
warlocks
who
told
a
curious
tale.
One
presumed
to
threaten
me,
so
I
killed
him
and
fed
him
to
the
other
three.
They
refused
to
eat
of
their
friend’s
flesh
at
first,
but
when
they
grew
hungry
enough
they
had
a
change
of
heart.
Men
are
meat.”

Balon
was
mad,
Aeron
is
madder,
and
Euron
is
maddest
of
them
all.
Victarion
was
turning
to
go
when
the
Crow’s
Eye
said,
“A
king
must
have
a
wife,
to
give
him
heirs.
Brother,
I
have
need
of
you.
Will
you
go
to
Slaver’s
Bay
and
bring
my
love
to
me?”

I
had
a
love
once
too.
Victarion’s
hands
coiled
into
fists,
and
a
drop
of
blood
fell
to
patter
on
the
floor.
I
should
beat
you
raw
and
red
and
feed
you
to
the
crabs,
the
same
as
I
did
her.
“You
have
sons,”
he
told
his
brother.

“Baseborn
mongrels,
born
of
whores
and
weepers.”

“They
are
of
your
body.”

“So
are
the
contents
of
my
chamber
pot.
None
is
fit
to
sit
the
Seastone
Chair,
much
less
the
Iron
Throne.
No,
to
make
an
heir
that’s
worthy
of
him,
I
need
a
different
woman.
When
the
kraken
weds
the
dragon,
brother,
let
all
the
world
beware.”

“What
dragon?”
said
Victarion,
frowning.

“The
last
of
her
line.
They
say
she
is
the
fairest
woman
in
the
world.
Her
hair
is
silver-gold,
and
her
eyes
are
amethysts...
but
you
need
not
take
my
word
for
it,
brother.
Go
to
Slaver’s
Bay,
behold
her
beauty,
and
bring
her
back
to
me.”

“Why
should
I?”
Victarion
demanded.

“For
love.
For
duty.
Because
your
king
commands
it.”
Euron
chuckled.
“And
for
the
Seastone
Chair.
It
is
yours,
once
I
claim
the
Iron
Throne.
You
shall
follow
me
as
I
followed
Balon...
and
your
own
trueborn
sons
shall
one
day
follow
you.”

My
own
sons.
But
to
have
a
trueborn
son
a
man
must
first
have
a
wife.
Victarion
had
no
luck
with
wives.
Euron’s
gifts
are
poisoned,
he
reminded
himself,
but
still...

“The
choice
is
yours,
brother.
Live
a
thrall
or
die
a
king.
Do
you
dare
to
fly?
Unless
you
take
the
leap,
you’ll
never
know.”

Euron’s
smiling
eye
was
bright
with
mockery.
“Or
do
I
ask
too
much
of
you?
It
is
a
fearsome
thing
to
sail
beyond
Valyria.”

“I
could
sail
the
Iron
Fleet
to
hell
if
need
be.”
When
Victarion
opened
his
hand,
his
palm
was
red
with
blood.
“I’ll
go
to
Slaver’s
Bay,
aye.
I’ll
find
this
dragon
woman,
and
I’ll
bring
her
back.”
But
not
for
you.
You
stole
my
wife
and
despoiled
her,
so
I’ll
have
yours.
The
fairest
woman
in
the
world,
for
me.





JAIME

The
fields
outside
the
walls
of
Darry
were
being
tilled
once
more.
The
burned
crops
had
been
plowed
under,
and
Ser
Addam’s
scouts
reported
seeing
women
in
the
furrows
pulling
weeds,
whilst
a
team
of
oxen
broke
new
ground
on
the
edge
of
a
nearby
wood.
A
dozen
bearded
men
with
axes
stood
guard
over
them
as
they
worked.

By
the
time
Jaime
and
his
column
reached
the
castle,
all
of
them
had
fled
within
the
walls.
He
found
Darry
closed
to
him,
just
as
Harrenhal
had
been.
A
chilly
welcome
from
mine
own
blood.

“Sound
the
horn,”
he
commanded.
Ser
Kennos
of
Kayce
unslung
the
Horn
of
Herrock
and
let
it
wind.
As
he
waited
for
a
response
from
the
castle,
Jaime
eyed
the
banner
floating
brown
and
crimson
above
his
cousin’s
barbican.
Lancel
had
taken
to
quartering
the
lion
of
Lannister
with
the
Darry
plowman,
it
would
seem.
He
saw
his
uncle’s
hand
in
that,
as
in
Lancel’s
choice
of
bride.
House
Darry
had
ruled
these
lands
since
the
Andals
cast
down
the
First
Men.
No
doubt
Ser
Kevan
realized
that
his
son
would
have
an
easier
time
of
it
if
the
peasants
saw
him
as
a
continuation
of
the
old
line,
holding
these
lands
by
right
of
marriage
rather
than
royal
decree.
Kevan
should
be
Tommen’s
Hand.
Harys
Swyft
is
a
toad,
and
my
sister
is
a
fool
if
she
thinks
elsewise.

The
castle
gates
swung
open
slowly.
“My
coz
will
not
have
room
to
accommodate
a
thousand
men,”
Jaime
told
Strongboar.
“We’ll
make
camp
beneath
the
western
wall.
I
want
the
perimeters
ditched
and
staked.
There
are
still
bands
of
outlaws
in
these
parts.”

“They’d
need
to
be
mad
to
attack
a
force
as
strong
as
ours.”

“Mad
or
starving.”
Until
he
had
a
better
notion
of
these
outlaws
and
their
strength,
Jaime
was
not
inclined
to
take
any
risks
with
his
defenses.
“Ditched
and
staked,”
he
said
again,
before
spurring
Honor
toward
the
gate.
Ser
Dermot
rode
beside
him
with
the
royal
stag
and
lion,
and
Ser
Hugo
Vance
with
the
white
standard
of
the
Kingsguard.
Jaime
had
charged
Red
Ronnet
with
the
task
of
delivering
Wylis
Manderly
to
Maidenpool,
so
he
would
not
need
to
look
on
him
henceforth.

Pia
rode
with
Jaime’s
squires,
on
the
gelding
Peck
had
found
for
her.
“It’s
like
some
toy
castle,”
Jaime
heard
her
say.
She’s
known
no
home
but
Harrenhal,
he
reflected.
Every
castle
in
the
realm
will
seem
small
to
her,
except
the
Rock.

Josmyn
Peckleton
was
saying
the
same
thing.
“You
must
not
judge
by
Harrenhal.
Black
Harren
built
too
big.”
Pia
listened
as
solemnly
as
a
girl
of
five
being
lessoned
by
her
septa.
That’s
all
she
is,
a
little
girl
in
a
woman’s
body,
scarred
and
scared.
Peck
was
taken
with
her,
though.
Jaime
suspected
that
the
boy
had
never
known
a
woman,
and
Pia
was
still
pretty
enough,
so
long
as
she
kept
her
mouth
closed.
There’s
no
harm
in
him
bedding
her,
I
suppose,
so
long
as
she’s
willing.

One
of
the
Mountain’s
men
had
tried
to
rape
the
girl
at
Harrenhal,
and
had
seemed
honestly
perplexed
when
Jaime
commanded
Ilyn
Payne
to
take
his
head
off.
“I
had
her
before,
a
hunnerd
times,”
he
kept
saying
as
they
forced
him
to
his
knees.
“A
hunnerd
times,
m’lord.
We
all
had
her.”
When
Ser
Ilyn
presented
Pia
with
his
head,
she
had
smiled
through
her
ruined
teeth.

Darry
had
changed
hands
several
times
during
the
fighting,
and
its
castle
had
been
burned
once
and
sacked
at
least
twice,
but
Lancel
had
seemingly
wasted
little
time
setting
things
to
rights.
The
castle
gates
were
newly
hung,
raw
oaken
planks
reinforced
with
iron
studs.
A
new
stable
was
going
up
where
an
older
one
had
been
put
to
the
torch.
The
steps
to
the
keep
had
been
replaced,
and
the
shutters
on
many
of
the
windows.
Blackened
stones
showed
where
the
flames
had
licked,
but
time
and
rain
would
fade
those.

Within
the
walls,
crossbowmen
walked
the
ramparts,
some
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms,
others
in
the
blue
and
grey
of
House
Frey.
As
Jaime
trotted
across
the
yard,
chickens
ran
out
from
under
Honor’s
hooves,
sheep
bleated,
and
peasants
stared
at
him
with
sullen
eyes.
Armed
peasants,
he
did
not
fail
to
note.
Some
had
scythes,
some
staves,
some
hoes
sharpened
to
cruel
points.
There
were
axes
in
evidence
as
well,
and
he
spied
several
bearded
men
with
red,
seven-pointed
stars
sewn
onto
ragged,
filthy
tunics.
More
bloody
sparrows.
Where
do
they
all
come
from?

Of
his
uncle
Kevan
he
saw
no
sign.
Nor
of
Lancel.
Only
a
maester
emerged
to
greet
him,
with
a
grey
robe
flapping
about
his
skinny
legs.
“Lord
Commander,
Darry
is
honored
by
this...
unexpected
visit.
You
must
forgive
our
lack
of
preparations.
We
had
been
given
to
understand
that
you
were
bound
for
Riverrun.”

“Darry
was
on
my
way,”
lied
Jaime.
Riverrun
will
keep.
And
if
perchance
the
siege
had
ended
before
he
reached
the
castle,
he
would
be
spared
the
need
to
take
up
arms
against
House
Tully.

Dismounting,
he
handed
Honor
to
a
stableboy.
“Will
I
find
my
uncle
here?”
He
did
not
supply
a
name.
Ser
Kevan
was
the
only
uncle
he
had
left,
the
last
surviving
son
of
Tytos
Lannister.

“No,
my
lord.
Ser
Kevan
took
his
leave
of
us
after
the
wedding.”
The
maester
pulled
at
the
chain
collar,
as
if
it
had
grown
too
tight
for
him.
“I
know
Lord
Lancel
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
and...
and
all
your
gallant
knights.
Though
it
pains
me
to
confess
that
Darry
cannot
feed
so
many.”

“We
have
our
own
provisions.
You
are?”

“Maester
Ottomore,
if
it
please
my
lord.
Lady
Amerei
wished
to
welcome
you
herself,
but
she
is
seeing
to
the
preparation
of
a
feast
in
your
honor.
It
is
her
hope
that
you
and
your
chief
knights
and
captains
will
join
us
at
table
this
evening.”

“A
hot
meal
would
be
most
welcome.
The
days
have
been
cold
and
wet.”
Jaime
glanced
about
the
yard,
at
the
bearded
faces
of
the
sparrows.
Too
many.
And
too
many
Freys
as
well.
“Where
will
I
find
Hardstone?”

“We
had
a
report
of
outlaws
beyond
the
Trident.
Ser
Harwyn
took
five
knights
and
twenty
archers
and
went
to
deal
with
them.”

“And
Lord
Lancel?”

“He
is
at
his
prayers.
His
lordship
has
commanded
us
never
to
disturb
him
when
he
is
praying.”

He
and
Ser
Bonifer
should
get
on
well.
“Very
well.”
There
would
be
time
enough
to
talk
with
his
cousin
later.
“Show
me
to
my
chambers
and
have
a
bath
brought
up.”

“If
it
please
my
lord,
we
have
put
you
in
the
Plowman’s
Keep.
I
will
show
you
there.”

“I
know
the
way.”
Jaime
was
no
stranger
to
this
castle.
He
and
Cersei
had
been
guests
here
twice
before,
once
on
their
way
to
Winterfell
with
Robert,
and
again
on
the
way
back
to
King’s
Landing.
Though
small
as
castles
went,
it
was
larger
than
an
inn,
with
good
hunting
along
the
river.
Robert
Baratheon
had
never
been
never
loath
to
impose
upon
the
hospitality
of
his
subjects.

The
keep
was
much
as
he
recalled
it.
“The
walls
are
still
bare,”
Jaime
observed
as
the
maester
led
him
down
a
gallery.

“Lord
Lancel
hopes
one
day
to
cover
them
with
hangings,”
said
Ottomore.
“Scenes
of
piety
and
devotion.”

Piety
and
devotion.
It
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
laugh.
The
walls
had
been
bare
on
his
first
visit
too.
Tyrion
had
pointed
out
the
squares
of
darker
stone
where
tapestries
had
once
hung.
Ser
Raymun
could
remove
the
hangings,
but
not
the
marks
they’d
left.
Later,
the
Imp
had
slipped
a
handful
of
stags
to
one
of
Darry’s
serving
men
for
the
key
to
the
cellar
where
the
missing
tapestries
were
hidden.
He
showed
them
to
Jaime
by
the
light
of
a
candle,
grinning;
woven
portraits
of
all
the
Targaryen
kings,
from
the
first
Aegon
to
the
second
Aenys.
“If
I
tell
Robert,
mayhaps
he’ll
make
me
Lord
of
Darry,”
the
dwarf
said,
chortling.

Maester
Ottomore
led
Jaime
to
the
top
of
the
keep.
“I
trust
you
will
be
comfortable
here,
my
lord.
There
is
a
privy,
when
nature
calls.
Your
window
looks
out
upon
the
godswood.
The
bedchamber
adjoins
her
ladyship’s,
with
a
servant’s
cell
between.”

“These
were
Lord
Darry’s
own
apartments.”

“Yes,
my
lord.”

“My
cousin
is
too
kind.
I
did
not
intend
to
put
Lancel
out
of
his
own
bedchamber.”

“Lord
Lancel
has
been
sleeping
in
the
sept.”

Sleeping
with
the
Mother
and
the
Maiden,
when
he
has
a
warm
wife
just
through
that
door?
Jaime
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
weep.
Maybe
he
is
praying
for
his
cock
to
harden.
In
King’s
Landing
it
had
been
rumored
that
Lancel’s
wounds
had
left
him
incapable.
Still,
he
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
try.
His
cousin’s
hold
on
his
new
lands
would
not
be
secure
until
he
fathered
a
son
on
his
half-Darry
wife.
Jaime
had
begun
to
rue
the
impulse
that
had
brought
him
here.
He
gave
thanks
to
Ottomore,
reminded
him
about
the
bath,
and
had
Peck
see
him
out.

The
lord’s
bedchamber
had
changed
since
his
last
visit,
and
not
for
the
better.
Old
stale
rushes
covered
the
floor
in
place
of
the
fine
Myrish
carpet
that
had
been
there
previously,
and
all
the
furnishings
were
new
and
crudely
made.
Ser
Raymun
Darry’s
bed
had
been
large
enough
to
sleep
six,
with
brown
velvet
draperies
and
oakwood
posts
carved
with
vines
and
leaves;
Lancel’s
was
a
lumpy
straw
pallet,
placed
beneath
the
window
where
the
first
light
of
day
would
be
sure
to
wake
him.
The
other
bed
had
no
doubt
been
burned
or
smashed
or
stolen,
but
even
so...

When
the
tub
arrived,
Little
Lew
pulled
off
Jaime’s
boots
and
helped
remove
his
golden
hand.
Peck
and
Garrett
hauled
water,
and
Pia
found
him
something
clean
to
sup
in.
The
girl
glanced
at
him
shyly
as
she
shook
his
doublet
out.
Jaime
was
uncomfortably
aware
of
the
curve
of
hip
and
breast
beneath
her
roughspun
brown
dress.
He
found
himself
remembering
the
things
that
Pia
had
whispered
to
him
at
Harrenhal,
the
night
that
Qyburn
sent
her
to
his
bed.
Sometimes
when
I’m
with
some
man,
she’d
said,
I
close
my
eyes
and
pretend
it’s
you
on
top
of
me.

He
was
grateful
when
the
bath
was
deep
enough
to
conceal
his
arousal.
As
he
lowered
himself
into
the
steaming
water,
he
recalled
another
bath,
the
one
he’d
shared
with
Brienne.
He
had
been
feverish
and
weak
from
loss
of
blood,
and
the
heat
had
made
him
so
dizzy
he
found
himself
saying
things
better
left
unsaid.
This
time
he
had
no
such
excuse.
Remember
your
vows.
Pia
is
more
fit
for
Tyrion’s
bed
than
yours.
“Fetch
me
soap
and
a
stiff
brush,”
he
told
Peck.
“Pia,
you
may
leave
us.”

“Aye,
m’lord.
Thank
you,
m’lord.”
She
covered
her
mouth
when
she
spoke,
to
hide
her
broken
teeth.

“Do
you
want
her?”
Jaime
asked
Peck,
when
she
was
gone.

The
squire
turned
beet
red.

“If
she’ll
have
you,
take
her.
She’ll
teach
you
a
few
things
you’ll
find
useful
on
your
wedding
night,
I
don’t
doubt,
and
you’re
not
like
to
get
a
bastard
by
her.”
Pia
had
spread
her
legs
for
half
his
father’s
army
and
never
quickened;
most
like
the
girl
was
barren.
“If
you
bed
her,
though,
be
kind
to
her.”

“Kind,
my
lord?
How...
how
would
I...?”

“Sweet
words.
Gentle
touches.
You
don’t
want
to
wed
her,
but
so
long
as
you’re
abed
treat
her
as
you
would
your
bride.”

The
lad
nodded.
“My
lord,
I...
where
should
I
take
her?
There’s
never
a
place
to...
to...”

“...to
be
alone?”
Jaime
grinned.
“We’ll
be
at
supper
several
hours.
The
straw
looks
lumpy,
but
it
should
serve.”

Peck’s
eyes
grew
wide.
“His
lordship’s
bed?”

“You’ll
feel
a
lord
yourself
when
you’re
done,
if
Pia
knows
her
business.”
And
someone
ought
to
make
some
use
of
that
miserable
straw
mattress.

When
he
descended
for
the
feast
that
night,
Jaime
Lannister
wore
a
doublet
of
red
velvet
slashed
with
cloth-of-gold,
and
a
golden
chain
studded
with
black
diamonds.
He
had
strapped
on
his
golden
hand
as
well,
polished
to
a
fine
bright
sheen.
This
was
no
fit
place
to
wear
his
whites.
His
duty
awaited
him
at
Riverrun;
a
darker
need
had
brought
him
here.

Darry’s
great
hall
was
great
only
by
courtesy.
Trestle
tables
crowded
it
from
wall
to
wall,
and
the
ceiling
rafters
were
black
with
smoke.
Jaime
had
been
seated
on
the
dais,
to
the
right
of
Lancel’s
empty
chair.
“Will
my
cousin
not
be
joining
us
for
supper?”
he
asked
as
he
sat
down.

“My
lord
prefers
to
fast,”
said
Lancel’s
wife,
the
Lady
Amerei.
“He’s
sick
with
grief
for
the
poor
High
Septon.”
She
was
a
long-legged,
full-breasted,
strapping
girl
of
some
eight-and-ten
years;
a
healthy
wench
to
look
at
her,
though
her
pinched,
chinless
face
reminded
Jaime
of
his
late
and
unlamented
cousin
Cleos,
who
had
always
looked
somewhat
like
a
weasel.

Fasting?
He
is
an
even
bigger
fool
than
I
suspected.
His
cousin
should
be
busy
fathering
a
little
weasel-faced
heir
on
his
widow
instead
of
starving
himself
to
death.
He
wondered
what
Ser
Kevan
might
have
had
to
say
about
his
son’s
new
fervor.
Could
that
be
the
reason
for
his
uncle’s
abrupt
departure?

Over
bowls
of
bean-and-bacon
soup
Lady
Amerei
told
Jaime
how
her
first
husband
had
been
slain
by
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
when
the
Freys
were
still
fighting
for
Robb
Stark.
“I
begged
him
not
to
go,
but
my
Pate
was
oh
so
very
brave,
and
swore
he
was
the
man
to
slay
that
monster.
He
wanted
to
make
a
great
name
for
himself.”

We
all
do.
“When
I
was
a
squire
I
told
myself
I’d
be
the
man
to
slay
the
Smiling
Knight.”

“The
Smiling
Knight?”
She
sounded
lost.
“Who
was
that?”

The
Mountain
of
my
boyhood.
Half
as
big
but
twice
as
mad.

“An
outlaw,
long
dead.
No
one
who
need
concern
your
ladyship.”

Amerei’s
lip
trembled.
Tears
rolled
from
her
brown
eyes.

“You
must
forgive
my
daughter,”
said
an
older
woman.
Lady
Amerei
had
brought
a
score
of
Freys
to
Darry
with
her;
a
sister,
an
uncle,
a
half
uncle,
various
cousins...
and
her
mother,
who
had
been
born
a
Darry.
“She
still
grieves
for
her
father.”

“Outlaws
killed
him,”
sobbed
Lady
Amerei.
“Father
had
only
gone
out
to
ransom
Petyr
Pimple.
He
brought
them
the
gold
they
asked
for,
but
they
hung
him
anyway.”

“Hanged,
Ami.
Your
father
was
not
a
tapestry.”
Lady
Mariya
turned
back
to
Jaime.
“I
believe
you
knew
him,
ser.”

“We
were
squires
together
once,
at
Crakehall.”
He
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
claim
they
had
been
friends.
When
Jaime
had
arrived,
Merrett
Frey
had
been
the
castle
bully,
lording
it
over
all
the
younger
boys.
Then
he
tried
to
bully
me.
“He
was...
very
strong.”
It
was
the
only
praise
that
came
to
mind.
Merrett
had
been
slow
and
clumsy
and
stupid,
but
he
was
strong.

“You
fought
against
the
Kingswood
Brotherhood
together,”
sniffed
Lady
Amerei.
“Father
used
to
tell
me
stories.”

Father
used
to
boast
and
lie,
you
mean.
“We
did.”
Frey’s
chief
contributions
to
the
fight
had
consisted
of
contracting
the
pox
from
a
camp
follower
and
getting
himself
captured
by
the
White
Fawn.
The
outlaw
queen
burned
her
sigil
into
his
arse
before
ransoming
him
back
to
Sumner
Crakehall.
Merrett
had
not
been
able
to
sit
down
for
a
fortnight,
though
Jaime
doubted
that
the
red-hot
iron
was
half
so
nasty
as
the
kettles
of
shit
his
fellow
squires
made
him
eat
once
he
was
returned.
Boys
are
the
cruelest
creatures
on
the
earth.
He
slipped
his
golden
hand
around
his
wine
cup
and
raised
it
up.
“To
Merrett’s
memory,”
he
said.
It
was
easier
to
drink
to
the
man
than
to
talk
of
him.

After
the
toast
Lady
Amerei
stopped
weeping
and
the
table
talk
turned
to
wolves,
of
the
four-footed
kind.
Ser
Danwell
Frey
claimed
there
were
more
of
them
about
than
even
his
grandfather
could
remember.
“They’ve
lost
all
fear
of
men.
Packs
of
them
attacked
our
baggage
train
on
our
way
down
from
the
Twins.
Our
archers
had
to
feather
a
dozen
before
the
others
fled.”
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
confessed
that
their
own
column
had
faced
similar
troubles
on
their
way
up
from
King’s
Landing.

Jaime
concentrated
on
the
fare
before
him,
tearing
off
chunks
of
bread
with
his
left
hand
and
fumbling
at
his
wine
cup
with
his
right.
He
watched
Addam
Marbrand
charm
the
girl
beside
him,
watched
Steffon
Swyft
refight
the
battle
for
King’s
Landing
with
bread
and
nuts
and
carrots.
Ser
Kennos
pulled
a
serving
girl
into
his
lap,
urging
her
to
stroke
his
horn,
whilst
Ser
Dermot
regaled
some
squires
with
tales
of
knight
errantry
in
the
rainwood.
Farther
down
the
table
Hugo
Vance
had
closed
his
eyes.
Brooding
on
the
mysteries
of
life,
thought
Jaime.
That,
or
napping
between
courses.
He
turned
back
to
Lady
Mariya.
“The
outlaws
who
killed
your
husband...
was
it
Lord
Beric’s
band?”

“So
we
thought,
at
first.”
Though
Lady
Mariya’s
hair
was
streaked
with
grey,
she
was
still
a
handsome
woman.
“The
killers
scattered
when
they
left
Oldstones.
Lord
Vypren
tracked
one
band
to
Fairmarket,
but
lost
them
there.
Black
Walder
led
hounds
and
hunters
into
Hag’s
Mire
after
the
others.
The
peasants
denied
seeing
them,
but
when
questioned
sharply
they
sang
a
different
song.
They
spoke
of
a
one-eyed
man
and
another
who
wore
a
yellow
cloak...
and
a
woman,
cloaked
and
hooded.”

“A
woman?”
He
would
have
thought
that
the
White
Fawn
would
have
taught
Merrett
to
stay
clear
of
outlaw
wenches.
“There
was
a
woman
in
the
Kingswood
Brotherhood
as
well.”

“I
know
of
her.”
How
not,
her
tone
suggested,
when
she
left
her
mark
upon
my
husband?
“The
White
Fawn
was
young
and
fair,
they
say.
This
hooded
woman
is
neither.
The
peasants
would
have
us
believe
that
her
face
was
torn
and
scarred,
and
her
eyes
terrible
to
look
upon.
They
claim
she
led
the
outlaws.”

“Led
them?”
Jaime
found
that
hard
to
believe.
“Beric
Dondarrion
and
the
red
priest...”

“...were
not
seen.”
Lady
Mariya
sounded
certain.

“Dondarrion’s
dead,”
said
Strongboar.
“The
Mountain
drove
a
knife
through
his
eye,
we
have
men
with
us
who
saw
it.”

“That’s
one
tale,”
said
Addam
Marbrand.
“Others
will
tell
you
that
Lord
Beric
can’t
be
killed.”

“Ser
Harwyn
says
those
tales
are
lies.”
Lady
Amerei
wound
a
braid
around
her
finger.
“He
has
promised
me
Lord
Beric’s
head.
He’s
very
gallant.”
She
was
blushing
beneath
her
tears.

Jaime
thought
back
on
the
head
he’d
given
to
Pia.
He
could
almost
hear
his
little
brother
chuckle.
Whatever
became
of
giving
women
flowers?
Tyrion
might
have
asked.
He
would
have
had
a
few
choice
words
for
Harwyn
Plumm
as
well,
though
gallant
would
not
have
been
one
of
them.
Plumm’s
brothers
were
big,
fleshy
fellows
with
thick
necks
and
red
faces;
loud
and
lusty,
quick
to
laugh,
quick
to
anger,
quick
to
forgive.
Harwyn
was
a
different
sort
of
Plumm;
hard-eyed
and
taciturn,
unforgiving...
and
deadly,
with
his
hammer
in
his
hand.
A
good
man
to
command
a
garrison,
but
not
a
man
to
love.
Although...
Jaime
gazed
at
Lady
Amerei.

The
serving
men
were
bringing
out
the
fish
course,
a
river
pike
baked
in
a
crust
of
herbs
and
crushed
nuts.
Lancel’s
lady
tasted
it,
approved,
and
commanded
that
the
first
portion
be
served
to
Jaime.
As
they
set
the
fish
before
him,
she
leaned
across
her
husband’s
place
to
touch
his
golden
hand.
“You
could
kill
Lord
Beric,
Ser
Jaime.
You
slew
the
Smiley
Knight.
Please,
my
lord,
I
beg
you,
stay
and
help
us
with
Lord
Beric
and
the
Hound.”
Her
pale
fingers
caressed
his
golden
ones.

Does
she
think
that
I
can
feel
that?
“The
Sword
of
the
Morning
slew
the
Smiling
Knight,
my
lady.
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
a
better
knight
than
me.”
Jaime
pulled
back
his
golden
fingers
and
turned
once
more
to
Lady
Mariya.
“How
far
did
Black
Walder
track
this
hooded
woman
and
her
men?”

“His
hounds
picked
up
their
scent
again
north
of
Hag’s
Mire,”
the
older
woman
told
him.
“He
swears
that
he
was
no
more
than
half
a
day
behind
them
when
they
vanished
into
the
Neck.”

“Let
them
rot
there,”
declared
Ser
Kennos
cheerfully.
“If
the
gods
are
good,
they’ll
be
swallowed
up
in
quicksand
or
gobbled
down
by
lizard-lions.”

“Or
taken
in
by
frogeaters,”
said
Ser
Danwell
Frey.
“I
would
not
put
it
past
the
crannogmen
to
shelter
outlaws.”

“Would
that
it
were
only
them,”
said
Lady
Mariya.
“Some
of
the
river
lords
are
hand
in
glove
with
Lord
Beric’s
men
as
well.”

“The
smallfolk
too,”
sniffed
her
daughter.
“Ser
Harwyn
says
they
hide
them
and
feed
them,
and
when
he
asks
where
they’ve
gone,
they
lie.
They
lie
to
their
own
lords!”

“Have
their
tongues
out,”
urged
Strongboar.

“Good
luck
getting
answers
then,”
said
Jaime.
“If
you
want
their
help,
you
need
to
make
them
love
you.
That
was
how
Arthur
Dayne
did
it,
when
we
rode
against
the
Kingswood
Brotherhood.
He
paid
the
smallfolk
for
the
food
we
ate,
brought
their
grievances
to
King
Aerys,
expanded
the
grazing
lands
around
their
villages,
even
won
them
the
right
to
fell
a
certain
number
of
trees
each
year
and
take
a
few
of
the
king’s
deer
during
the
autumn.
The
forest
folk
had
looked
to
Toyne
to
defend
them,
but
Ser
Arthur
did
more
for
them
than
the
Brotherhood
could
ever
hope
to
do,
and
won
them
to
our
side.
After
that,
the
rest
was
easy.”

“The
Lord
Commander
speaks
wisely,”
said
Lady
Mariya.
“We
shall
never
be
rid
of
these
outlaws
until
the
smallfolk
come
to
love
Lancel
as
much
as
they
once
loved
my
father
and
grandfather.”

Jaime
glanced
at
his
cousin’s
empty
place.
Lancel
will
never
win
their
love
by
praying,
though.

Lady
Amerei
put
on
a
pout.
“Ser
Jaime,
I
pray
you,
do
not
abandon
us.
My
lord
has
need
of
you,
and
so
do
I.
These
are
such
fearful
times.
Some
nights
I
can
hardly
sleep,
for
fear.”

“My
place
is
with
the
king,
my
lady.”

“I’ll
come,”
offered
Strongboar.
“Once
we’re
done
at
Riverrun,
I’ll
be
itching
for
another
fight.
Not
that
Beric
Dondarrion
is
like
to
give
me
one.
I
recall
the
man
from
tourneys
past.
A
comely
lad
in
a
pretty
cloak,
he
was.
Slight
and
callow.”

“That
was
before
he
died,”
said
young
Ser
Arwood
Frey.
“Death
changed
him,
the
smallfolk
say.
You
can
kill
him,
but
he
won’t
stay
dead.
How
do
you
fight
a
man
like
that?
And
there’s
the
Hound
as
well.
He
slew
twenty
men
at
Saltpans.”

Strongboar
guffawed.
“Twenty
fat
innkeeps,
maybe.
Twenty
serving
men
pissing
in
their
breeches.
Twenty
begging
brothers
armed
with
bowls.
Not
twenty
knights.
Not
me.”

“There
is
a
knight
at
Saltpans,”
Ser
Arwood
insisted.
“He
hid
behind
his
walls
whilst
Clegane
and
his
mad
dogs
ravaged
through
his
town.
You
have
not
seen
the
things
he
did,
ser.
I
have.
When
the
reports
reached
the
Twins,
I
rode
down
with
Harys
Haigh
and
his
brother
Donnel
and
half
a
hundred
men,
archers
and
men-at-arms.
We
thought
it
was
Lord
Beric’s
work,
and
hoped
to
find
his
trail.
All
that
remains
of
Saltpans
is
the
castle,
and
old
Ser
Quincy
so
frightened
he
would
not
open
his
gates,
but
shouted
down
at
us
from
his
battlements.
The
rest
is
bones
and
ashes.
A
whole
town.
The
Hound
put
the
buildings
to
the
torch
and
the
people
to
the
sword
and
rode
off
laughing.
The
women...
you
would
not
believe
what
he
did
to
some
of
the
women.
I
will
not
speak
of
it
at
table.
It
made
me
sick
to
see.”

“I
cried
when
I
heard,”
said
Lady
Amerei.

Jaime
sipped
his
wine.
“What
makes
you
certain
it
was
the
Hound?”
What
they
were
describing
sounded
more
like
Gregor’s
work
than
Sandor’s.
Sandor
had
been
hard
and
brutal,
yes,
but
it
was
his
big
brother
who
was
the
real
monster
in
House
Clegane.

“He
was
seen,”
Ser
Arwood
said.
“That
helm
of
his
is
not
easily
mistaken,
nor
forgotten,
and
there
were
a
few
who
survived
to
tell
the
tale.
The
girl
he
raped,
some
boys
who
hid,
a
woman
we
found
trapped
beneath
a
blackened
beam,
the
fisherfolk
who
watched
the
butchery
from
their
boats...”

“Do
not
call
it
butchery,”
Lady
Mariya
said
softly.
“That
gives
insult
to
honest
butchers
everywhere.
Saltpans
was
the
work
of
some
fell
beast
in
human
skin.”

This
is
a
time
for
beasts,
Jaime
reflected,
for
lions
and
wolves
and
angry
dogs,
for
ravens
and
carrion
crows.

“Evil
work.”
Strongboar
filled
his
cup
again.
“Lady
Mariya,
Lady
Amerei,
your
distress
has
moved
me.
You
have
my
word,
once
Riverrun
has
fallen
I
shall
return
to
hunt
down
the
Hound
and
kill
him
for
you.
Dogs
do
not
frighten
me.”

This
one
should.
Both
men
were
large
and
powerful,
but
Sandor
Clegane
was
much
quicker,
and
fought
with
a
savagery
that
Lyle
Crakehall
could
not
hope
to
match.

Lady
Amerei
was
thrilled,
however.
“You
are
a
true
knight,
Ser
Lyle,
to
help
a
lady
in
distress.”

At
least
she
did
not
call
herself
“a
maiden.”
Jaime
reached
for
his
cup
and
knocked
it
over.
The
linen
tablecloth
drank
the
wine.
As
the
red
stain
spread,
his
companions
all
pretended
not
to
notice.
High
table
courtesy,
he
told
himself,
but
it
tasted
just
like
pity.
He
rose
abruptly.
“My
lady.
Pray
excuse
me.”

Lady
Amerei
looked
stricken.
“Would
you
leave
us?
There’s
venison
to
come,
and
capons
stuffed
with
leeks
and
mushrooms.”

“Very
fine,
no
doubt,
but
I
could
not
eat
another
bite.
I
need
to
see
my
cousin.”
Bowing,
Jaime
left
them
to
their
food.

Men
were
eating
in
the
yard
as
well.
The
sparrows
had
gathered
round
a
dozen
cookfires
to
warm
their
hands
against
the
chill
of
dusk
and
watch
fat
sausages
spit
and
sizzle
above
the
flames.
There
had
to
be
a
hundred
of
them.
Useless
mouths.
Jaime
wondered
how
many
sausages
his
cousin
had
laid
by
and
how
he
intended
to
feed
the
sparrows
once
they
were
gone.
They
will
be
eating
rats
by
winter,
unless
they
can
get
a
harvest
in.
This
late
in
autumn,
the
chances
of
another
harvest
were
not
good.

He
found
the
sept
off
the
castle’s
inner
ward;
a
windowless,
seven-sided,
half-timbered
building
with
carved
wood
doors
and
a
tiled
roof.
Three
sparrows
sat
upon
its
steps.
When
Jaime
approached,
they
rose.
“Where
you
going,
m’lord?”
asked
one.
He
was
the
smallest
of
the
three,
but
he
had
the
biggest
beard.

“Inside.”

“His
lordship’s
in
there,
praying.”

“His
lordship
is
my
cousin.”

“Well,
then,
m’lord,”
said
a
different
sparrow,
a
huge
bald
man
with
a
seven-pointed
star
painted
over
one
eye,
“you
won’t
want
to
bother
your
cousin
at
his
prayers.”

“Lord
Lancel
is
asking
the
Father
Above
for
guidance,”
said
the
third
sparrow,
the
beardless
one.
A
boy,
Jaime
had
thought,
but
her
voice
marked
her
for
a
woman,
dressed
in
shapeless
rags
and
a
shirt
of
rusted
mail.
“He
is
praying
for
the
soul
of
the
High
Septon
and
all
the
others
who
have
died.”

“They’ll
still
be
dead
tomorrow,”
Jaime
told
her.
“The
Father
Above
has
more
time
than
I
do.
Do
you
know
who
I
am?”

“Some
lord,”
said
the
big
man
with
the
starry
eye.

“Some
cripple,”
said
the
small
one
with
the
big
beard.

“The
Kingslayer,”
said
the
woman,
“but
we’re
no
kings,
just
Poor
Fellows,
and
you
can’t
go
in
unless
his
lordship
says
you
can.”
She
hefted
a
spiked
club,
and
the
small
man
raised
an
axe.

The
doors
behind
them
opened.
“Let
my
cousin
pass
in
peace,
friends,”
Lancel
said
softly.
“I
have
been
expecting
him.”

The
sparrows
moved
aside.

Lancel
looked
even
thinner
than
he
had
at
King’s
Landing.
He
was
barefoot,
and
dressed
in
a
plain,
roughspun
tunic
of
undyed
wool
that
made
him
look
more
like
a
beggar
than
a
lord.
The
crown
of
his
head
had
been
shaved
smooth,
but
his
beard
had
grown
out
a
little.
To
call
it
peach
fuzz
would
have
given
insult
to
the
peach.
It
went
queerly
with
the
white
hair
around
his
ears.

“Cousin,”
said
Jaime
when
they
were
alone
within
the
sept,
“have
you
lost
your
bloody
wits?”

“I
prefer
to
say
I’ve
found
my
faith.”

“Where
is
your
father?”

“Gone.
We
quarreled.”
Lancel
knelt
before
the
altar
of
his
other
Father.
“Will
you
pray
with
me,
Jaime?”

“If
I
pray
nicely,
will
the
Father
give
me
a
new
hand?”

“No.
But
the
Warrior
will
give
you
courage,
the
Smith
will
lend
you
strength,
and
the
Crone
will
give
you
wisdom.”

“It’s
a
hand
I
need.”
The
seven
gods
loomed
above
carved
altars,
the
dark
wood
gleaming
in
the
candlelight.
A
faint
smell
of
incense
hung
in
the
air.
“You
sleep
down
here?”

“Each
night
I
make
my
bed
beneath
a
different
altar,
and
the
Seven
send
me
visions.”

Baelor
the
Blessed
once
had
visions
too.
Especially
when
he
was
fasting.
“How
long
has
it
been
since
you’ve
eaten?”

“My
faith
is
all
the
nourishment
I
need.”

“Faith
is
like
porridge.
Better
with
milk
and
honey.”

“I
dreamed
that
you
would
come.
In
the
dream
you
knew
what
I
had
done.
How
I’d
sinned.
You
killed
me
for
it.”

“You’re
more
like
to
kill
yourself
with
all
this
fasting.
Didn’t
Baelor
the
Blessed
fast
himself
onto
a
bier?”

“Our
lives
are
candle
flames,
says
The
Seven-Pointed
Star.
Any
errant
puff
of
wind
can
snuff
us
out.
Death
is
never
far
in
this
world,
and
seven
hells
await
sinners
who
do
not
repent
their
sins.
Pray
with
me,
Jaime.”

“If
I
do,
will
you
eat
a
bowl
of
porridge?”
When
his
coz
did
not
answer,
Jaime
sighed.
“You
should
be
sleeping
with
your
wife,
not
with
the
Maid.
You
need
a
son
with
Darry
blood
if
you
want
to
keep
this
castle.”

“A
pile
of
cold
stones.
I
never
asked
for
it.
I
never
wanted
it.
I
only
wanted...”
Lancel
shuddered.
“Seven
save
me,
but
I
wanted
to
be
you.”

Jaime
had
to
laugh.
“Better
me
than
Blessed
Baelor.
Darry
needs
a
lion,
coz.
So
does
your
little
Frey.
She
gets
moist
between
the
legs
every
time
someone
mentions
Hardstone.
If
she
hasn’t
bedded
him
yet,
she
will
soon.”

“If
she
loves
him,
I
wish
them
joy
of
one
another.”

“A
lion
shouldn’t
have
horns.
You
took
the
girl
to
wife.”

“I
said
some
words
and
gave
her
a
red
cloak,
but
only
to
please
Father.
Marriage
requires
consummation.
King
Baelor
was
made
to
wed
his
sister
Daena,
but
they
never
lived
as
man
and
wife,
and
he
put
her
aside
as
soon
as
he
was
crowned.”

“The
realm
would
have
been
better
served
if
he
had
closed
his
eyes
and
fucked
her.
I
know
enough
history
to
know
that.
In
any
case,
you’re
not
like
to
be
taken
for
Baelor
the
Blessed.”

“No,”
Lancel
allowed.
“He
was
a
rare
spirit,
pure
and
brave
and
innocent,
untouched
by
all
the
evils
of
the
world.
I
am
a
sinner,
with
much
and
more
to
atone
for.”

Jaime
put
his
hand
on
his
cousin’s
shoulder.
“What
do
you
know
of
sin,
coz?
I
killed
my
king.”

“The
brave
man
slays
with
a
sword,
the
craven
with
a
wineskin.
We
are
both
kingslayers,
ser.”

“Robert
was
no
true
king.
Some
might
even
say
that
a
stag
is
a
lion’s
natural
prey.”
Jaime
could
feel
the
bones
beneath
his
cousin’s
skin...
and
something
else
as
well.
Lancel
was
wearing
a
hair
shirt
underneath
his
tunic.
“What
else
did
you
do,
to
require
so
much
atonement?
Tell
me.”

His
cousin
bowed
his
head,
tears
running
down
his
cheeks.

Those
tears
were
all
the
answer
Jaime
needed.
“You
killed
the
king,”
he
said,
“then
you
fucked
the
queen.”

“I
never...”

“...lay
with
my
sweet
sister?”
Say
it.
Say
it!

“Never
spilled
my
seed
in...
in
her...”

“...cunt?”
suggested
Jaime.

“...womb,”
Lancel
finished.
“It
is
not
treason
unless
you
finish
inside.
I
gave
her
comfort,
after
the
king
died.
You
were
a
captive,
your
father
was
in
the
field,
and
your
brother...
she
was
afraid
of
him,
and
with
good
reason.
He
made
me
betray
her.”

“Did
he?”
Lancel
and
Ser
Osmund
and
how
many
more?
Was
the
part
about
Moon
Boy
just
a
gibe?
“Did
you
force
her?”

“No!
I
loved
her.
I
wanted
to
protect
her.”

You
wanted
to
be
me.
His
phantom
fingers
itched.
The
day
his
sister
had
come
to
White
Sword
Tower
to
beg
him
to
renounce
his
vows,
she
had
laughed
after
he
refused
her
and
boasted
of
having
lied
to
him
a
thousand
times.
Jaime
had
taken
that
for
a
clumsy
attempt
to
hurt
him
as
he’d
hurt
her.
It
may
have
been
the
only
true
thing
that
she
ever
said
to
me.

“Do
not
think
ill
of
the
queen,”
Lancel
pleaded.
“All
flesh
is
weak,
Jaime.
No
harm
came
of
our
sin.
No...
no
bastard.”

“No.
Bastards
are
seldom
made
upon
the
belly.”
He
wondered
what
his
cousin
would
say
if
he
were
to
confess
his
own
sins,
the
three
treasons
Cersei
had
named
Joffrey,
Tommen,
and
Myrcella.

“I
was
angry
with
Her
Grace
after
the
battle,
but
the
High
Septon
said
I
must
forgive
her.”

“You
confessed
your
sins
to
His
High
Holiness,
did
you?”

“He
prayed
for
me
when
I
was
wounded.
He
was
a
good
man.”

He’s
a
dead
man.
They
rang
the
bells
for
him.
He
wondered
if
his
cousin
had
any
notion
what
fruit
his
words
had
borne.
“Lancel,
you’re
a
bloody
fool.”

“You
are
not
wrong,”
said
Lancel,
“but
my
folly
is
behind
me,
ser.
I
have
asked
the
Father
Above
to
show
me
the
way,
and
he
has.
I
am
renouncing
this
lordship
and
this
wife.
Hardstone
is
welcome
to
the
both
of
them,
if
he
likes.
On
the
morrow
I
will
return
to
King’s
Landing
and
swear
my
sword
to
the
new
High
Septon
and
the
Seven.
I
mean
to
take
vows
and
join
the
Warrior’s
Sons.”

The
boy
was
not
making
sense.
“The
Warrior’s
Sons
were
proscribed
three
hundred
years
ago.”

“The
new
High
Septon
has
revived
them.
He’s
sent
out
a
call
for
worthy
knights
to
pledge
their
lives
and
swords
to
the
service
of
the
Seven.
The
Poor
Fellows
are
to
be
restored
as
well.”

“Why
would
the
Iron
Throne
allow
that?”
One
of
the
early
Targaryen
kings
had
fought
for
years
to
suppress
the
two
military
orders,
Jaime
recalled,
though
he
did
not
remember
which.
Maegor,
perhaps,
or
the
first
Jaehaerys.
Tyrion
would
have
known.

“His
High
Holiness
writes
that
King
Tommen
has
given
his
consent.
I
will
show
you
the
letter,
if
you
like.”

“Even
if
this
is
true...
you
are
a
lion
of
the
Rock,
a
lord.
You
have
a
wife,
a
castle,
lands
to
defend,
people
to
protect.
If
the
gods
are
good,
you
will
have
sons
of
your
blood
to
follow
you.
Why
would
you
throw
all
that
away
for...
for
some
vow?”

“Why
did
you?”
asked
Lancel
softly.

For
honor,
Jaime
might
have
said.
For
glory.
That
would
have
been
a
lie,
though.
Honor
and
glory
had
played
their
parts,
but
most
of
it
had
been
for
Cersei.
A
laugh
escaped
his
lips.
“Is
it
the
High
Septon
you’re
running
to,
or
my
sweet
sister?
Pray
on
that
one,
coz.
Pray
hard.”

“Will
you
pray
with
me,
Jaime?”

He
glanced
about
the
sept,
at
the
gods.
The
Mother,
full
of
mercy.
The
Father,
stern
in
judgment.
The
Warrior,
one
hand
upon
his
sword.
The
Stranger
in
the
shadows,
his
half-human
face
concealed
beneath
a
hooded
mantle.
I
thought
that
I
was
the
Warrior
and
Cersei
was
the
Maid,
but
all
the
time
she
was
the
Stranger,
hiding
her
true
face
from
my
gaze.
“Pray
for
me,
if
you
like,”
he
told
his
cousin.
“I’ve
forgotten
all
the
words.”

The
sparrows
were
still
fluttering
about
the
steps
when
Jaime
stepped
back
out
into
the
night.
“Thank
you,”
he
told
them.
“I
feel
ever
so
much
holier
now.”

He
went
and
found
Ser
Ilyn
and
a
pair
of
swords.

The
castle
yard
was
full
of
eyes
and
ears.
To
escape
them,
they
sought
out
Darry’s
godswood.
There
were
no
sparrows
there,
only
trees
bare
and
brooding,
their
black
branches
scratching
at
the
sky.
A
mat
of
dead
leaves
crunched
beneath
their
feet.

“Do
you
see
that
window,
ser?”
Jaime
used
a
sword
to
point.
“That
was
Raymun
Darry’s
bedchamber.
Where
King
Robert
slept,
on
our
return
from
Winterfell.
Ned
Stark’s
daughter
had
run
off
after
her
wolf
savaged
Joff,
you’ll
recall.
My
sister
wanted
the
girl
to
lose
a
hand.
The
old
penalty,
for
striking
one
of
the
blood
royal.
Robert
told
her
she
was
cruel
and
mad.
They
fought
for
half
the
night...
well,
Cersei
fought,
and
Robert
drank.
Past
midnight,
the
queen
summoned
me
inside.
The
king
was
passed
out
snoring
on
the
Myrish
carpet.
I
asked
my
sister
if
she
wanted
me
to
carry
him
to
bed.
She
told
me
I
should
carry
her
to
bed,
and
shrugged
out
of
her
robe.
I
took
her
on
Raymun
Darry’s
bed
after
stepping
over
Robert.
If
His
Grace
had
woken
I
would
have
killed
him
there
and
then.
He
would
not
have
been
the
first
king
to
die
upon
my
sword...
but
you
know
that
story,
don’t
you?”
He
slashed
at
a
tree
branch,
shearing
it
in
half.
“As
I
was
fucking
her,
Cersei
cried,
‘I
want.’
I
thought
that
she
meant
me,
but
it
was
the
Stark
girl
that
she
wanted,
maimed
or
dead.”
The
things
I
do
for
love.
“It
was
only
by
chance
that
Stark’s
own
men
found
the
girl
before
me.
If
I
had
come
on
her
first...”

The
pockmarks
on
Ser
Ilyn’s
face
were
black
holes
in
the
torchlight,
as
dark
as
Jaime’s
soul.
He
made
that
clacking
sound.

He
is
laughing
at
me,
realized
Jaime
Lannister.
“For
all
I
know
you
fucked
my
sister
too,
you
pock-faced
bastard,”
he
spat
out.
“Well,
shut
your
bloody
mouth
and
kill
me
if
you
can.”





BRIENNE

The
septry
stood
upon
an
upthrust
island
half
a
mile
from
the
shore,
where
the
wide
mouth
of
the
Trident
widened
further
still
to
kiss
the
Bay
of
Crabs.
Even
from
shore
its
prosperity
was
apparent.
Its
slope
was
covered
with
terraced
fields,
with
fishponds
down
below
and
a
windmill
above,
its
wood-and-sailcloth
blades
turning
slowly
in
the
breeze
off
the
bay.
Brienne
could
see
sheep
grazing
on
the
hillside
and
storks
wading
in
the
shallow
waters
around
the
ferry
landing.

“Saltpans
is
just
across
the
water,”
said
Septon
Meribald,
pointing
north
across
the
bay.
“The
brothers
will
ferry
us
over
on
the
morning
tide,
though
I
fear
what
we
shall
find
there.
Let
us
enjoy
a
good
hot
meal
before
we
face
that.
The
brothers
always
have
a
bone
to
spare
for
Dog.”
Dog
barked
and
wagged
his
tail.

The
tide
was
going
out
now,
and
swiftly.
The
water
that
separated
the
island
from
the
shore
was
receding,
leaving
behind
a
broad
expanse
of
glistening
brown
mudflats
dotted
by
tidal
pools
that
glittered
like
golden
coins
in
the
afternoon
sun.
Brienne
scratched
the
back
of
her
neck,
where
an
insect
had
bitten
her.
She
had
pinned
her
hair
up,
and
the
sun
had
warmed
her
skin.

“Why
do
they
call
it
the
Quiet
Isle?”
asked
Podrick.

“Those
who
dwell
here
are
penitents,
who
seek
to
atone
for
their
sins
through
contemplation,
prayer,
and
silence.
Only
the
Elder
Brother
and
his
proctors
are
permitted
to
speak,
and
the
proctors
only
for
one
day
of
every
seven.”

“The
silent
sisters
never
speak,”
said
Podrick.
“I
heard
they
don’t
have
any
tongues.”

Septon
Meribald
smiled.
“Mothers
have
been
cowing
their
daughters
with
that
tale
since
I
was
your
age.
There
was
no
truth
to
it
then
and
there
is
none
now.
A
vow
of
silence
is
an
act
of
contrition,
a
sacrifice
by
which
we
prove
our
devotion
to
the
Seven
Above.
For
a
mute
to
take
a
vow
of
silence
would
be
akin
to
a
legless
man
giving
up
the
dance.”
He
led
his
donkey
down
the
slope,
beckoning
them
to
follow.
“If
you
would
sleep
beneath
a
roof
tonight,
you
must
climb
off
your
horses
and
cross
the
mud
with
me.
The
path
of
faith,
we
call
it.
Only
the
faithful
may
cross
safely.
The
wicked
are
swallowed
by
the
quicksands,
or
drowned
when
the
tide
comes
rushing
in.
None
of
you
are
wicked,
I
hope?
Even
so,
I
would
be
careful
where
I
set
my
feet.
Walk
only
where
I
walk,
and
you
shall
reach
the
other
side.”

The
path
of
faith
was
a
crooked
one,
Brienne
could
not
help
but
note.
Though
the
island
seemed
to
rise
to
the
northeast
of
where
they
left
the
shore,
Septon
Meribald
did
not
make
directly
for
it.
Instead,
he
started
due
east,
toward
the
deeper
waters
of
the
bay,
which
shimmered
blue
and
silver
in
the
distance.
The
soft
brown
mud
squished
up
between
his
toes.
As
he
walked
he
paused
from
time
to
time,
to
probe
ahead
with
his
quarterstaff.
Dog
stayed
near
his
heels,
sniffing
at
every
rock,
shell,
and
clump
of
seaweed.
For
once
he
did
not
bound
ahead
or
stray.

Brienne
followed,
taking
care
to
keep
close
to
the
line
of
prints
left
by
the
dog,
the
donkey,
and
the
holy
man.
Then
came
Podrick,
and
last
of
all
Ser
Hyle.
A
hundred
yards
out,
Meribald
turned
abruptly
toward
the
south,
so
his
back
was
almost
to
the
septry.
He
proceeded
in
that
direction
for
another
hundred
yards,
leading
them
between
two
shallow
tidal
pools.
Dog
stuck
his
nose
in
one
and
yelped
when
a
crab
pinched
it
with
his
claw.
A
brief
but
furious
struggle
ensued
before
the
dog
came
trotting
back,
wet
and
mud-spattered,
with
the
crab
between
his
jaws.

“Isn’t
that
where
we
want
to
go?”
Ser
Hyle
called
out
from
behind
them,
pointing
at
the
septry.
“We
seem
to
be
walking
every
way
but
toward
it.”

“Faith,”
urged
Septon
Meribald.
“Believe,
persist,
and
follow,
and
we
shall
find
the
peace
we
seek.”

The
flats
shimmered
wetly
all
about
them,
mottled
in
half
a
hundred
hues.
The
mud
was
such
a
dark
brown
it
appeared
almost
black,
but
there
were
swathes
of
golden
sand
as
well,
upthrust
rocks
both
grey
and
red,
and
tangles
of
black
and
green
seaweed.
Storks
stalked
through
the
tidal
pools
and
left
their
footprints
all
around
them,
and
crabs
scuttled
across
the
surface
of
shallow
waters.
The
air
smelled
of
brine
and
rot,
and
the
ground
sucked
at
their
feet
and
let
them
go
only
reluctantly,
with
a
pop
and
a
squelchy
sigh.
Septon
Meribald
turned
and
turned
again
and
yet
again.
His
footprints
filled
up
with
water
as
soon
as
he
moved
on.
By
the
time
the
ground
grew
firmer
and
began
to
rise
beneath
the
feet,
they
had
walked
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half.

Three
men
were
waiting
for
them
as
they
clambered
up
the
broken
stones
that
ringed
the
isle’s
shoreline.
They
were
clad
in
the
brown-and-dun
robes
of
brothers,
with
wide
bell
sleeves
and
pointed
cowls.
Two
had
wound
lengths
of
wool
about
the
lower
halves
of
their
faces
as
well,
so
all
that
could
be
seen
of
them
were
their
eyes.
The
third
brother
was
the
one
to
speak.
“Septon
Meribald,”
he
called.
“It
has
been
nigh
upon
a
year.
You
are
welcome.
Your
companions
as
well.”

Dog
wagged
his
tail,
and
Meribald
shook
mud
from
his
feet.
“Might
we
beg
your
hospitality
for
a
night?”

“Yes,
of
course.
There’s
to
be
fish
stew
this
evening.
Will
you
require
the
ferry
in
the
morning?”

“If
it
is
not
too
much
to
ask.”
Meribald
turned
to
his
fellow
travelers.
“Brother
Narbert
is
a
proctor
of
the
order,
so
he
is
allowed
to
speak
one
day
of
every
seven.
Brother,
these
good
folk
helped
me
on
my
way.
Ser
Hyle
Hunt
is
a
gallant
from
the
Reach.
The
lad
is
Podrick
Payne,
late
of
the
westerland.
And
this
is
Lady
Brienne,
known
as
the
Maid
of
Tarth.”

Brother
Narbert
drew
up
short.
“A
woman.”

“Yes,
brother.”
Brienne
unpinned
her
hair
and
shook
it
out.
“Do
you
have
no
women
here?”

“Not
at
present,”
said
Narbert.
“Those
women
who
do
visit
come
to
us
sick
or
hurt,
or
heavy
with
child.
The
Seven
have
blessed
our
Elder
Brother
with
healing
hands.
He
has
restored
many
a
man
to
health
that
even
the
maesters
could
not
cure,
and
many
a
woman
too.”

“I
am
not
sick
or
hurt
or
heavy
with
child.”

“Lady
Brienne
is
a
warrior
maid,”
confided
Septon
Meribald,
“hunting
for
the
Hound.”

“Aye?”
Narbert
seemed
taken
aback.
“To
what
end?”

Brienne
touched
Oathkeeper’s
hilt.
“His,”
she
said.

The
proctor
studied
her.
“You
are...
brawny
for
a
woman,
it
is
true,
but...
mayhaps
I
should
take
you
up
to
Elder
Brother.
He
will
have
seen
you
crossing
the
mud.
Come.”

Narbert
led
them
along
a
pebbled
path
and
through
a
grove
of
apple
trees
to
a
whitewashed
stable
with
a
peaked
thatch
roof.
“You
may
leave
your
animals
here.
Brother
Gillam
will
see
that
they
are
fed
and
watered.”

The
stable
was
more
than
three-quarters
empty.
At
one
end
were
half
a
dozen
mules,
being
tended
by
a
bandy-legged
little
brother
whom
Brienne
took
for
Gillam.
Way
down
at
the
far
end,
well
away
from
the
other
animals,
a
huge
black
stallion
trumpeted
at
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
kicked
at
the
door
of
his
stall.

Ser
Hyle
gave
the
big
horse
an
admiring
look
as
he
was
handing
his
reins
to
Brother
Gillam.
“A
handsome
beast.”

Brother
Narbert
sighed.
“The
Seven
send
us
blessings,
and
the
Seven
send
us
trials.
Handsome
he
may
be,
but
Driftwood
was
surely
whelped
in
hell.
When
we
sought
to
harness
him
to
a
plow
he
kicked
Brother
Rawney
and
broke
his
shinbone
in
two
places.
We
had
hoped
gelding
might
improve
the
beast’s
ill
temper,
but...
Brother
Gillam,
will
you
show
them?”

Brother
Gillam
lowered
his
cowl.
Underneath
he
had
a
mop
of
blond
hair,
a
tonsured
scalp,
and
a
bloodstained
bandage
where
he
should
have
had
an
ear.

Podrick
gasped.
“The
horse
bit
off
your
ear?”

Gillam
nodded,
and
covered
his
head
again.

“Forgive
me,
brother,”
said
Ser
Hyle,
“but
I
might
take
the
other
ear,
if
you
approached
me
with
a
pair
of
shears.”

The
jest
did
not
sit
well
with
Brother
Narbert.
“You
are
a
knight,
ser.
Driftwood
is
a
beast
of
burden.
The
Smith
gave
men
horses
to
help
them
in
their
labors.”
He
turned
away.
“If
you
will.
Elder
Brother
will
no
doubt
be
waiting.”

The
slope
was
steeper
than
it
had
looked
from
across
the
mudflats.
To
ease
it,
the
brothers
had
erected
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
that
wandered
back
and
forth
across
the
hillside
and
amongst
the
buildings.
After
a
long
day
in
the
saddle
Brienne
was
glad
for
a
chance
to
stretch
her
legs.

They
passed
a
dozen
brothers
of
the
order
on
their
way
up;
cowled
men
in
dun-and-brown
who
gave
them
curious
looks
as
they
went
by,
but
spoke
no
word
of
greeting.
One
was
leading
a
pair
of
milk
cows
toward
a
low
barn
roofed
in
sod;
another
worked
a
butter
churn.
On
the
upper
slopes
they
saw
three
boys
driving
sheep,
and
higher
still
they
passed
a
lichyard
where
a
brother
bigger
than
Brienne
was
struggling
to
dig
a
grave.
From
the
way
he
moved,
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
was
lame.
As
he
flung
a
spadeful
of
the
stony
soil
over
one
shoulder,
some
chanced
to
spatter
against
their
feet.
“Be
more
watchful
there,”
chided
Brother
Narbert.
“Septon
Meribald
might
have
gotten
a
mouthful
of
dirt.”
The
gravedigger
lowered
his
head.
When
Dog
went
to
sniff
him
he
dropped
his
spade
and
scratched
his
ear.

“A
novice,”
explained
Narbert.

“Who
is
the
grave
for?”
asked
Ser
Hyle,
as
they
resumed
their
climb
up
the
wooden
steps.

“Brother
Clement,
may
the
Father
judge
him
justly.”

“Was
he
old?”
asked
Podrick
Payne.

“If
you
consider
eight-and-forty
old,
aye,
but
it
was
not
the
years
that
killed
him.
He
died
of
wounds
he
got
at
Saltpans.
He
had
taken
some
of
our
mead
to
the
market
there,
on
the
day
the
outlaws
descended
on
the
town.”

“The
Hound?”
said
Brienne.

“Another,
just
as
brutal.
He
cut
poor
Clement’s
tongue
out
when
he
would
not
speak.
Since
he
had
taken
a
vow
of
silence,
the
raider
said
he
had
no
need
of
it.
The
Elder
Brother
will
know
more.
He
keeps
the
worst
of
the
tidings
from
outside
to
himself,
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
the
septry.
Many
of
our
brothers
came
here
to
escape
the
horrors
of
the
world,
not
to
dwell
upon
them.
Brother
Clement
was
not
the
only
wounded
man
amongst
us.
Some
wounds
do
not
show.”
Brother
Narbert
gestured
to
their
right.
“There
lies
our
summer
arbor.
The
grapes
are
small
and
tart,
but
make
a
drinkable
wine.
We
brew
our
own
ale
as
well,
and
our
mead
and
cider
are
far
famed.”

“The
war
has
never
come
here?”
Brienne
said.

“Not
this
war,
praise
the
Seven.
Our
prayers
protect
us.”

“And
your
tides,”
suggested
Meribald.
Dog
barked
agreement.

The
brow
of
the
hill
was
crowned
by
a
low
wall
of
unmortared
stone,
encircling
a
cluster
of
large
buildings;
the
windmill,
its
sails
creaking
as
they
turned,
the
cloisters
where
the
brothers
slept
and
the
common
hall
where
they
took
their
meals,
a
wooden
sept
for
prayer
and
meditation.
The
sept
had
windows
of
leaded
glass,
wide
doors
carved
with
likenesses
of
the
Mother
and
the
Father,
and
a
seven-sided
steeple
with
a
walk
on
top.
Behind
it
was
a
vegetable
garden
where
some
older
brothers
were
pulling
weeds.
Brother
Narbert
led
the
visitors
around
a
chestnut
tree
to
a
wooden
door
set
in
the
side
of
the
hill.

“A
cave
with
a
door?”
Ser
Hyle
said,
surprised.

Septon
Meribald
smiled.
“It
is
called
the
Hermit’s
Hole.
The
first
holy
man
to
find
his
way
here
lived
therein,
and
worked
such
wonders
that
others
came
to
join
him.
That
was
two
thousand
years
ago,
they
say.
The
door
came
somewhat
later.”

Perhaps
two
thousand
years
ago
the
Hermit’s
Hole
had
been
a
damp,
dark
place,
floored
with
dirt
and
echoing
to
the
sounds
of
dripping
water,
but
no
longer.
The
cave
that
Brienne
and
her
companions
entered
had
been
turned
into
a
warm,
snug
sanctum.
Woolen
carpets
covered
the
ground,
tapestries
the
walls.
Tall
beeswax
candles
gave
more
than
ample
light.
The
furnishings
were
strange
but
simple;
a
long
table,
a
settle,
a
chest,
several
tall
cases
full
of
books,
and
chairs.
All
were
made
from
driftwood,
oddly
shaped
pieces
cunningly
joined
together
and
polished
till
they
shone
a
deep
gold
in
the
candlelight.

The
Elder
Brother
was
not
what
Brienne
had
expected.
He
could
hardly
be
called
elder,
for
a
start;
whereas
the
brothers
weeding
in
the
garden
had
had
the
stooped
shoulders
and
bent
backs
of
old
men,
he
stood
straight
and
tall,
and
moved
with
the
vigor
of
a
man
in
the
prime
of
his
years.
Nor
did
he
have
the
gentle,
kindly
face
she
expected
of
a
healer.
His
head
was
large
and
square,
his
eyes
shrewd,
his
nose
veined
and
red.
Though
he
wore
a
tonsure,
his
scalp
was
as
stubbly
as
his
heavy
jaw.

He
looks
more
like
a
man
made
to
break
bones
than
to
heal
one,
thought
the
Maid
of
Tarth,
as
the
Elder
Brother
strode
across
the
room
to
embrace
Septon
Meribald
and
pat
Dog.
“It
is
always
a
glad
day
when
our
friends
Meribald
and
Dog
honor
us
with
another
visit,”
he
announced,
before
turning
to
his
other
guests.
“And
new
faces
are
always
welcome.
We
see
so
few
of
them.”

Meribald
performed
the
customary
courtesies
before
seating
himself
upon
the
settle.
Unlike
Septon
Narbert,
the
Elder
Brother
did
not
seem
dismayed
by
Brienne’s
sex,
but
his
smile
did
flicker
and
fade
when
the
septon
told
him
why
she
and
Ser
Hyle
had
come.
“I
see,”
was
all
he
said,
before
he
turned
away
with,
“You
must
be
thirsty.
Please,
have
some
of
our
sweet
cider
to
wash
the
dust
of
travel
from
your
throats.”
He
poured
for
them
himself.
The
cups
were
carved
from
driftwood
too,
no
two
the
same.
When
Brienne
complimented
them,
he
said,
“My
lady
is
too
kind.
All
we
do
is
cut
and
polish
the
wood.
We
are
blessed
here.
Where
the
river
meets
the
bay,
the
currents
and
the
tides
wrestle
one
against
the
other,
and
many
strange
and
wondrous
things
are
pushed
toward
us,
to
wash
up
on
our
shores.
Driftwood
is
the
least
of
it.
We
have
found
silver
cups
and
iron
pots,
sacks
of
wool
and
bolts
of
silk,
rusted
helms
and
shining
swords...
aye,
and
rubies.”

That
interested
Ser
Hyle.
“Rhaegar’s
rubies?”

“It
may
be.
Who
can
say?
The
battle
was
long
leagues
from
here,
but
the
river
is
tireless
and
patient.
Six
have
been
found.
We
are
all
waiting
for
the
seventh.”

“Better
rubies
than
bones.”
Septon
Meribald
was
rubbing
his
foot,
the
mud
flaking
off
beneath
his
finger.
“Not
all
the
river’s
gifts
are
pleasant.
The
good
brothers
collect
the
dead
as
well.
Drowned
cows,
drowned
deer,
dead
pigs
swollen
up
to
half
the
size
of
horses.
Aye,
and
corpses.”

“Too
many
corpses,
these
days.”
The
Elder
Brother
sighed.
“Our
gravedigger
knows
no
rest.
Rivermen,
westermen,
northmen,
all
wash
up
here.
Knights
and
knaves
alike.
We
bury
them
side
by
side,
Stark
and
Lannister,
Blackwood
and
Bracken,
Frey
and
Darry.
That
is
the
duty
the
river
asks
of
us
in
return
for
all
its
gifts,
and
we
do
it
as
best
we
can.
Sometimes
we
find
a
woman,
though...
or
worse,
a
little
child.
Those
are
the
cruelest
gifts.”
He
turned
to
Septon
Meribald.
“I
hope
that
you
have
time
to
absolve
us
of
our
sins.
Since
the
raiders
slew
old
Septon
Bennet,
we
have
had
no
one
to
hear
confession.”

“I
shall
make
time,”
said
Meribald,
“though
I
hope
you
have
some
better
sins
than
the
last
time
I
came
through.”
Dog
barked.
“You
see?
Even
Dog
was
bored.”

Podrick
Payne
was
puzzled.
“I
thought
no
one
could
talk.
Well,
not
no
one.
The
brothers.
The
other
brothers,
not
you.”

“We
are
allowed
to
break
silence
when
confessing,”
said
the
Elder
Brother.
“It
is
hard
to
speak
of
sin
with
signs
and
nods.”

“Did
they
burn
the
sept
at
Saltpans?”
asked
Hyle
Hunt.

The
smile
vanished.
“They
burned
everything
at
Saltpans,
save
the
castle.
Only
that
was
made
of
stone...
though
it
had
as
well
been
made
of
suet
for
all
the
good
it
did
the
town.
It
fell
to
me
to
treat
some
of
the
survivors.
The
fisherfolk
brought
them
across
the
bay
to
me
after
the
flames
had
gone
out
and
they
deemed
it
safe
to
land.
One
poor
woman
had
been
raped
a
dozen
times,
and
her
breasts...
my
lady,
you
wear
man’s
mail,
so
I
shall
not
spare
you
these
horrors...
her
breasts
had
been
torn
and
chewed
and
eaten,
as
if
by
some...
cruel
beast.
I
did
what
I
could
for
her,
though
that
was
little
enough.
As
she
lay
dying,
her
worst
curses
were
not
for
the
men
who
had
raped
her,
nor
the
monster
who
devoured
her
living
flesh,
but
for
Ser
Quincy
Cox,
who
barred
his
gates
when
the
outlaws
entered
the
town
and
sat
safe
behind
stone
walls
as
his
people
screamed
and
died.”

“Ser
Quincy
is
an
old
man,”
said
Septon
Meribald
gently.
“His
sons
and
good-sons
are
far
away
or
dead,
his
grandsons
are
still
boys,
and
he
has
two
daughters.
What
could
he
have
done,
one
man
against
so
many?”

He
could
have
tried,
Brienne
thought.
He
could
have
died.
Old
or
young,
a
true
knight
is
sworn
to
protect
those
who
are
weaker
than
himself,
or
die
in
the
attempt.

“True
words,
and
wise,”
the
Elder
Brother
said
to
Septon
Meribald.
“When
you
cross
to
Saltpans,
no
doubt
Ser
Quincy
will
ask
you
for
forgiveness.
I
am
glad
that
you
are
here
to
give
it.
I
could
not.”
He
put
aside
the
driftwood
cup,
and
stood.
“The
supper
bell
will
sound
soon.
My
friends,
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
sept,
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
the
good
folk
of
Saltpans
before
we
sit
down
to
break
bread
and
share
some
meat
and
mead?”

“Gladly,”
said
Meribald.
Dog
barked.

Their
supper
in
the
septry
was
as
strange
a
meal
as
Brienne
had
ever
eaten,
though
not
at
all
unpleasant.
The
food
was
plain,
but
very
good;
there
were
loaves
of
crusty
bread
still
warm
from
the
ovens,
crocks
of
fresh-churned
butter,
honey
from
the
septry’s
hives,
and
a
thick
stew
of
crabs,
mussels,
and
at
least
three
different
kinds
of
fish.
Septon
Meribald
and
Ser
Hyle
drank
the
mead
the
brothers
made,
and
pronounced
it
excellent,
whilst
she
and
Podrick
contented
themselves
with
more
sweet
cider.
Nor
was
the
meal
a
somber
one.
Meribald
pronounced
a
prayer
before
the
food
was
served,
and
whilst
the
brothers
ate
at
four
long
trestle
tables,
one
of
their
number
played
for
them
on
the
high
harp,
filling
the
hall
with
soft
sweet
sounds.
When
the
Elder
Brother
excused
the
musician
to
take
his
own
meal,
Brother
Narbert
and
another
proctor
took
turns
reading
from
The
Seven-Pointed
Star.

By
the
time
the
readings
were
completed,
the
last
of
the
food
had
been
cleared
away
by
the
novices
whose
task
it
was
to
serve.
Most
were
boys
near
Podrick’s
age,
or
younger,
but
there
were
grown
men
as
well,
amongst
them
the
big
gravedigger
they
had
encountered
on
the
hill,
who
walked
with
the
awkward
lurching
gait
of
one
half-crippled.
As
the
hall
emptied,
the
Elder
Brother
asked
Narbert
to
show
Podrick
and
Ser
Hyle
to
their
pallets
in
the
cloisters.
“You
will
not
mind
sharing
a
cell,
I
hope?
It
is
not
large,
but
you
will
find
it
comfortable.”

“I
want
to
stay
with
ser,”
said
Podrick.
“I
mean,
my
lady.”

“What
you
and
Lady
Brienne
may
do
elsewhere
is
between
you
and
the
Seven,”
said
Brother
Narbert,
“but
on
the
Quiet
Isle,
men
and
women
do
not
sleep
beneath
the
same
roof
unless
they
are
wed.”

“We
have
some
modest
cottages
set
aside
for
the
women
who
visit
us,
be
they
noble
ladies
or
common
village
girls,”
said
the
Elder
Brother.
“They
are
not
oft
used,
but
we
keep
them
clean
and
dry.
Lady
Brienne,
would
you
allow
me
to
show
you
the
way?”

“Yes,
thank
you.
Podrick,
go
with
Ser
Hyle.
We
are
guests
of
the
holy
brothers
here.
Beneath
their
roof,
their
rules.”

The
women’s
cottages
were
on
the
east
side
of
the
isle,
looking
out
over
a
broad
expanse
of
mud
and
the
distant
waters
of
the
Bay
of
Crabs.
It
was
colder
here
than
on
the
sheltered
side,
and
wilder.
The
hill
was
steeper,
and
the
path
meandered
back
and
forth
through
weeds
and
briars,
wind-carved
rocks,
and
twisted,
thorny
trees
that
clung
tenaciously
to
the
stony
hillside.
The
Elder
Brother
brought
a
lantern
to
light
their
way
down.
At
one
turn
he
paused.
“On
a
clear
night
you
could
see
the
fires
of
Saltpans
from
here.
Across
the
bay,
just
there.”
He
pointed.

“There’s
nothing,”
Brienne
said.

“Only
the
castle
remains.
Even
the
fisherfolk
are
gone,
the
fortunate
few
who
were
out
on
the
water
when
the
raiders
came.
They
watched
their
houses
burn
and
listened
to
screams
and
cries
float
across
the
harbor,
too
fearful
to
land
their
boats.
When
at
last
they
came
ashore,
it
was
to
bury
friends
and
kin.
What
is
there
for
them
at
Saltpans
now
but
bones
and
bitter
memories?
They
have
moved
to
Maidenpool
or
other
towns.”
He
gestured
with
the
lantern,
and
they
resumed
their
descent.
“Saltpans
was
never
an
important
port,
but
ships
did
call
there
from
time
to
time.
That
was
what
the
raiders
wanted,
a
galley
or
a
cog
to
carry
them
across
the
narrow
sea.
When
none
was
at
hand,
they
took
their
rage
and
desperation
out
upon
the
townsfolk.
I
wonder,
my
lady...
what
do
you
hope
to
find
there?”

“A
girl,”
she
told
him.
“A
highborn
maid
of
three-and-ten,
with
a
fair
face
and
auburn
hair.”

“Sansa
Stark.”
The
name
was
softly
said.
“You
believe
this
poor
child
is
with
the
Hound?”

“The
Dornishman
said
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
Riverrun.
Timeon.
He
was
a
sellsword,
one
of
the
Brave
Companions,
a
killer
and
a
raper
and
a
liar,
but
I
do
not
think
he
lied
about
this.
He
said
that
the
Hound
stole
her
and
carried
her
away.”

“I
see.”
The
path
turned,
and
there
were
the
cottages
ahead
of
them.
The
Elder
Brother
had
called
them
modest.
That
they
were.
They
looked
like
beehives
made
of
stone,
low
and
rounded,
windowless.
“This
one,”
he
said,
indicating
the
nearest
cottage,
the
only
one
with
smoke
rising
from
the
smokehole
in
the
center
of
its
roof.
Brienne
had
to
duck
when
entering
to
keep
from
banging
her
head
against
the
lintel.
Inside
she
found
a
dirt
floor,
a
straw
pallet,
furs
and
blankets
to
keep
her
warm,
a
basin
of
water,
a
flagon
of
cider,
some
bread
and
cheese,
a
small
fire,
and
two
low
chairs.
The
Elder
Brother
sat
in
one,
and
put
the
lantern
down.
“May
I
stay
a
while?
I
feel
that
we
should
talk.”

“If
you
wish.”
Brienne
undid
her
swordbelt
and
hung
it
from
the
second
chair,
then
sat
cross-legged
on
the
pallet.

“Your
Dornishman
did
not
lie,”
the
Elder
Brother
began,
“but
I
fear
you
did
not
understand
him.
You
are
chasing
the
wrong
wolf,
my
lady.
Eddard
Stark
had
two
daughters.
It
was
the
other
one
that
Sandor
Clegane
made
off
with,
the
younger
one.”

“Arya
Stark?”
Brienne
stared
open-mouthed,
astonished.
“You
know
this?
Lady
Sansa’s
sister
is
alive?”

“Then,”
said
the
Elder
Brother.
“Now...
I
do
not
know.
She
may
have
been
amongst
the
children
slain
at
Saltpans.”

The
words
were
a
knife
in
her
belly.
No,
Brienne
thought.
No,
that
would
be
too
cruel.
“May
have
been...
meaning
that
you
are
not
certain...?”

“I
am
certain
that
the
child
was
with
Sandor
Clegane
at
the
inn
beside
the
crossroads,
the
one
old
Masha
Heddle
used
to
keep,
before
the
lions
hanged
her.
I
am
certain
they
were
on
their
way
to
Saltpans.
Beyond
that...
no.
I
do
not
know
where
she
is,
or
even
if
she
lives.
There
is
one
thing
I
do
know,
however.
The
man
you
hunt
is
dead.”

That
was
another
shock.
“How
did
he
die?”

“By
the
sword,
as
he
had
lived.”

“You
know
this
for
a
certainty?”

“I
buried
him
myself.
I
can
tell
you
where
his
grave
lies,
if
you
wish.
I
covered
him
with
stones
to
keep
the
carrion
eaters
from
digging
up
his
flesh,
and
set
his
helm
atop
the
cairn
to
mark
his
final
resting
place.
That
was
a
grievous
error.
Some
other
wayfarer
found
my
marker
and
claimed
it
for
himself.
The
man
who
raped
and
killed
at
Saltpans
was
not
Sandor
Clegane,
though
he
may
be
as
dangerous.
The
riverlands
are
full
of
such
scavengers.
I
will
not
call
them
wolves.
Wolves
are
nobler
than
that...
and
so
are
dogs,
I
think.

“I
know
a
little
of
this
man,
Sandor
Clegane.
He
was
Prince
Joffrey’s
sworn
shield
for
many
a
year,
and
even
here
we
would
hear
tell
of
his
deeds,
both
good
and
ill.
If
even
half
of
what
we
heard
was
true,
this
was
a
bitter,
tormented
soul,
a
sinner
who
mocked
both
gods
and
men.
He
served,
but
found
no
pride
in
service.
He
fought,
but
took
no
joy
in
victory.
He
drank,
to
drown
his
pain
in
a
sea
of
wine.
He
did
not
love,
nor
was
he
loved
himself.
It
was
hate
that
drove
him.
Though
he
committed
many
sins,
he
never
sought
forgiveness.
Where
other
men
dream
of
love,
or
wealth,
or
glory,
this
man
Sandor
Clegane
dreamed
of
slaying
his
own
brother,
a
sin
so
terrible
it
makes
me
shudder
just
to
speak
of
it.
Yet
that
was
the
bread
that
nourished
him,
the
fuel
that
kept
his
fires
burning.
Ignoble
as
it
was,
the
hope
of
seeing
his
brother’s
blood
upon
his
blade
was
all
this
sad
and
angry
creature
lived
for...
and
even
that
was
taken
from
him,
when
Prince
Oberyn
of
Dorne
stabbed
Ser
Gregor
with
a
poisoned
spear.”

“You
sound
as
if
you
pity
him,”
said
Brienne.

“I
did.
You
would
have
pitied
him
as
well,
if
you
had
seen
him
at
the
end.
I
came
upon
him
by
the
Trident,
drawn
by
his
cries
of
pain.
He
begged
me
for
the
gift
of
mercy,
but
I
am
sworn
not
to
kill
again.
Instead,
I
bathed
his
fevered
brow
with
river
water,
and
gave
him
wine
to
drink
and
a
poultice
for
his
wound,
but
my
efforts
were
too
little
and
too
late.
The
Hound
died
there,
in
my
arms.
You
may
have
seen
a
big
black
stallion
in
our
stables.
That
was
his
warhorse,
Stranger.
A
blasphemous
name.
We
prefer
to
call
him
Driftwood,
as
he
was
found
beside
the
river.
I
fear
he
has
his
former
master’s
nature.”

The
horse.
She
had
seen
the
stallion,
had
heard
it
kicking,
but
she
had
not
understood.
Destriers
were
trained
to
kick
and
bite.
In
war
they
were
a
weapon,
like
the
men
who
rode
them.
Like
the
Hound.
“It
is
true,
then,”
she
said
dully.
“Sandor
Clegane
is
dead.”

“He
is
at
rest.”
The
Elder
Brother
paused.
“You
are
young,
child.
I
have
counted
four-and-forty
name
days...
which
makes
me
more
than
twice
your
age,
I
think.
Would
it
surprise
you
to
learn
that
I
was
once
a
knight?”

“No.
You
look
more
like
a
knight
than
you
do
a
holy
man.”
It
was
written
in
his
chest
and
shoulders,
and
across
that
thick
square
jaw.
“Why
would
you
give
up
knighthood?”

“I
never
chose
it.
My
father
was
a
knight,
and
his
before
him.
So
were
my
brothers,
every
one.
I
was
trained
for
battle
since
the
day
they
deemed
me
old
enough
to
hold
a
wooden
sword.
I
saw
my
share
of
them,
and
did
not
disgrace
myself.
I
had
women
too,
and
there
I
did
disgrace
myself,
for
some
I
took
by
force.
There
was
a
girl
I
wished
to
marry,
the
younger
daughter
of
a
petty
lord,
but
I
was
my
father’s
thirdborn
son
and
had
neither
land
nor
wealth
to
offer
her...
only
a
sword,
a
horse,
a
shield.
All
in
all,
I
was
a
sad
man.
When
I
was
not
fighting,
I
was
drunk.
My
life
was
writ
in
red,
in
blood
and
wine.”

“When
did
it
change?”
asked
Brienne.

“When
I
died
in
the
Battle
of
the
Trident.
I
fought
for
Prince
Rhaegar,
though
he
never
knew
my
name.
I
could
not
tell
you
why,
save
that
the
lord
I
served
served
a
lord
who
served
a
lord
who
had
decided
to
support
the
dragon
rather
than
the
stag.
Had
he
decided
elsewise,
I
might
have
been
on
the
other
side
of
the
river.
The
battle
was
a
bloody
thing.
The
singers
would
have
us
believe
it
was
all
Rhaegar
and
Robert
struggling
in
the
stream
for
a
woman
both
of
them
claimed
to
love,
but
I
assure
you,
other
men
were
fighting
too,
and
I
was
one.
I
took
an
arrow
through
the
thigh
and
another
through
the
foot,
and
my
horse
was
killed
from
under
me,
yet
I
fought
on.
I
can
still
remember
how
desperate
I
was
to
find
another
horse,
for
I
had
no
coin
to
buy
one,
and
without
a
horse
I
would
no
longer
be
a
knight.
That
was
all
that
I
was
thinking
of,
if
truth
be
told.
I
never
saw
the
blow
that
felled
me.
I
heard
hooves
behind
my
back
and
thought,
a
horse!
but
before
I
could
turn
something
slammed
into
my
head
and
knocked
me
back
into
the
river,
where
by
rights
I
should
have
drowned.

“Instead
I
woke
here,
upon
the
Quiet
Isle.
The
Elder
Brother
told
me
I
had
washed
up
on
the
tide,
naked
as
my
name
day.
I
can
only
think
that
someone
found
me
in
the
shallows,
stripped
me
of
my
armor,
boots,
and
breeches,
and
pushed
me
back
out
into
the
deeper
water.
The
river
did
the
rest.
We
are
all
born
naked,
so
I
suppose
it
was
only
fitting
that
I
come
into
my
second
life
the
same
way.
I
spent
the
next
ten
years
in
silence.”

“I
see.”
Brienne
did
not
know
why
he
was
telling
her
all
of
this,
or
what
else
she
ought
to
say.

“Do
you?”
He
leaned
forward,
his
big
hands
on
his
knees.
“If
so,
give
up
this
quest
of
yours.
The
Hound
is
dead,
and
in
any
case
he
never
had
your
Sansa
Stark.
As
for
this
beast
who
wears
his
helm,
he
will
be
found
and
hanged.
The
wars
are
ending,
and
these
outlaws
cannot
survive
the
peace.
Randyll
Tarly
is
hunting
them
from
Maidenpool
and
Walder
Frey
from
the
Twins,
and
there
is
a
new
young
lord
in
Darry,
a
pious
man
who
will
surely
set
his
lands
to
rights.
Go
home,
child.
You
have
a
home,
which
is
more
than
many
can
say
in
these
dark
days.
You
have
a
noble
father
who
must
surely
love
you.
Consider
his
grief
if
you
should
never
return.
Perhaps
they
will
bring
your
sword
and
shield
to
him,
after
you
have
fallen.
Perhaps
he
will
even
hang
them
in
his
hall
and
look
on
them
with
pride...
but
if
you
were
to
ask
him,
I
know
he
would
tell
you
that
he
would
sooner
have
a
living
daughter
than
a
shattered
shield.”

“A
daughter.”
Brienne’s
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“He
deserves
that.
A
daughter
who
could
sing
to
him
and
grace
his
hall
and
bear
him
grandsons.
He
deserves
a
son
too,
a
strong
and
gallant
son
to
bring
honor
to
his
name.
Galladon
drowned
when
I
was
four
and
he
was
eight,
though,
and
Alysanne
and
Arianne
died
still
in
the
cradle.
I
am
the
only
child
the
gods
let
him
keep.
The
freakish
one,
not
fit
to
be
a
son
or
daughter.”
All
of
it
came
pouring
out
of
Brienne
then,
like
black
blood
from
a
wound;
the
betrayals
and
betrothals,
Red
Ronnet
and
his
rose,
Lord
Renly
dancing
with
her,
the
wager
for
her
maidenhead,
the
bitter
tears
she
shed
the
night
her
king
wed
Margaery
Tyrell,
the
mêlée
at
Bitterbridge,
the
rainbow
cloak
that
she
had
been
so
proud
of,
the
shadow
in
the
king’s
pavilion,
Renly
dying
in
her
arms,
Riverrun
and
Lady
Catelyn,
the
voyage
down
the
Trident,
dueling
Jaime
in
the
woods,
the
Bloody
Mummers,
Jaime
crying
“Sapphires,”
Jaime
in
the
tub
at
Harrenhal
with
steam
rising
from
his
body,
the
taste
of
Vargo
Hoat’s
blood
when
she
bit
down
on
his
ear,
the
bear
pit,
Jaime
leaping
down
onto
the
sand,
the
long
ride
to
King’s
Landing,
Sansa
Stark,
the
vow
she’d
sworn
to
Jaime,
the
vow
she’d
sworn
to
Lady
Catelyn,
Oathkeeper,
Duskendale,
Maidenpool,
Nimble
Dick
and
Crackclaw
and
the
Whispers,
the
men
she’d
killed...

“I
have
to
find
her,”
she
finished.
“There
are
others
looking,
all
wanting
to
capture
her
and
sell
her
to
the
queen.
I
have
to
find
her
first.
I
promised
Jaime.
Oathkeeper,
he
named
the
sword.
I
have
to
try
to
save
her...
or
die
in
the
attempt.”





CERSEI

“A
thousand
ships!”
The
little
queen’s
brown
hair
was
tousled
and
uncombed,
and
the
torchlight
made
her
cheeks
look
flushed,
as
if
she
had
just
come
from
some
man’s
embrace.
“Your
Grace,
this
must
be
answered
fiercely!”
Her
last
word
rang
off
the
rafters
and
echoed
through
the
cavernous
throne
room.

Seated
on
her
gold-and-crimson
high
seat
beneath
the
Iron
Throne,
Cersei
could
feel
a
growing
tightness
in
her
neck.
Must,
she
thought.
She
dares
say
“must”
to
me.
She
itched
to
slap
the
Tyrell
girl
across
the
face.
She
should
be
on
her
knees,
begging
for
my
help.
Instead,
she
presumes
to
tell
her
rightful
queen
what
she
must
do.

“A
thousand
ships?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
was
wheezing.
“Surely
not.
No
lord
commands
a
thousand
ships.”

“Some
frightened
fool
has
counted
double,”
agreed
Orton
Merryweather.
“That,
or
Lord
Tyrell’s
bannermen
are
lying
to
us,
puffing
up
the
numbers
of
the
foe
so
we
will
not
think
them
lax.”

The
torches
on
the
back
wall
threw
the
long,
barbed
shadow
of
the
Iron
Throne
halfway
to
the
doors.
The
far
end
of
the
hall
was
lost
in
darkness,
and
Cersei
could
not
but
feel
that
the
shadows
were
closing
around
her
too.
My
enemies
are
everywhere,
and
my
friends
are
useless.
She
had
only
to
glance
at
her
councillors
to
know
that;
only
Lord
Qyburn
and
Aurane
Waters
seemed
awake.
The
others
had
been
roused
from
bed
by
Margaery’s
messengers
pounding
on
their
doors,
and
stood
there
rumpled
and
confused.
Outside
the
night
was
black
and
still.
The
castle
and
the
city
slept.
Boros
Blount
and
Meryn
Trant
seemed
to
be
sleeping
too,
albeit
on
their
feet.
Even
Osmund
Kettleblack
was
yawning.
Not
Loras,
though.
Not
our
Knight
of
Flowers.
He
stood
behind
his
little
sister,
a
pale
shadow
with
a
longsword
on
his
hip.

“Half
as
many
ships
would
still
be
five
hundred,
my
lord,”
Waters
pointed
out
to
Orton
Merryweather.
“Only
the
Arbor
has
enough
strength
at
sea
to
oppose
a
fleet
that
size.”

“What
of
your
new
dromonds?”
asked
Ser
Harys.
“The
longships
of
the
ironmen
cannot
stand
before
our
dromonds,
surely?
King
Robert’s
Hammer
is
the
mightiest
warship
in
all
Westeros.”

“She
was,”
said
Waters.
“Sweet
Cersei
will
be
her
equal,
once
complete,
and
Lord
Tywin
will
be
twice
the
size
of
either.
Only
half
are
fitted
out,
however,
and
none
is
fully
crewed.
Even
when
they
are,
the
numbers
would
be
greatly
against
us.
The
common
longship
is
small
compared
to
our
galleys,
this
is
true,
but
the
ironmen
have
larger
ships
as
well.
Lord
Balon’s
Great
Kraken
and
the
warships
of
the
Iron
Fleet
were
made
for
battle,
not
for
raids.
They
are
the
equal
of
our
lesser
war
galleys
in
speed
and
strength,
and
most
are
better
crewed
and
captained.
The
ironmen
live
their
whole
lives
at
sea.”

Robert
should
have
scoured
the
isles
after
Balon
Greyjoy
rose
against
him,
Cersei
thought.
He
smashed
their
fleet,
burned
their
towns,
and
broke
their
castles,
but
when
he
had
them
on
their
knees
he
let
them
up
again.
He
should
have
made
another
island
of
their
skulls.
That
was
what
her
father
would
have
done,
but
Robert
never
had
the
stomach
that
a
king
requires
if
he
hopes
to
keep
peace
in
the
realm.
“The
ironmen
have
not
dared
raid
the
Reach
since
Dagon
Greyjoy
sat
the
Seastone
Chair,”
she
said.
“Why
would
they
do
so
now?
What
has
emboldened
them?”

“Their
new
king.”
Qyburn
stood
with
his
hands
hidden
up
his
sleeves.
“Lord
Balon’s
brother.
The
Crow’s
Eye,
he
is
called.”

“Carrion
crows
make
their
feasts
upon
the
carcasses
of
the
dead
and
dying,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“They
do
not
descend
upon
hale
and
healthy
animals.
Lord
Euron
will
gorge
himself
on
gold
and
plunder,
aye,
but
as
soon
as
we
move
against
him
he
will
back
to
Pyke,
as
Lord
Dagon
was
wont
to
do
in
his
day.”

“You
are
wrong,”
said
Margaery
Tyrell.
“Reavers
do
not
come
in
such
strength.
A
thousand
ships!
Lord
Hewett
and
Lord
Chester
are
slain,
as
well
as
Lord
Serry’s
son
and
heir.
Serry
has
fled
to
Highgarden
with
what
few
ships
remain
him,
and
Lord
Grimm
is
a
prisoner
in
his
own
castle.
Willas
says
that
the
iron
king
has
raised
up
four
lords
of
his
own
in
their
places.”

Willas,
Cersei
thought,
the
cripple.
He
is
to
blame
for
this.
That
oaf
Mace
Tyrell
left
the
defense
of
the
Reach
in
the
hands
of
a
hapless
weakling.
“It
is
a
long
voyage
from
the
Iron
Isles
to
the
Shields,”
she
pointed
out.
“How
could
a
thousand
ships
come
all
that
way
without
being
seen?”

“Willas
believes
that
they
did
not
follow
the
coast,”
said
Margaery.
“They
made
the
voyage
out
of
sight
of
land,
sailing
far
out
into
the
Sunset
Sea
and
swooping
back
in
from
the
west.”

More
like
the
cripple
did
not
have
his
watchtowers
manned,
and
now
he
fears
to
have
us
know
it.
The
little
queen
is
making
excuses
for
her
brother.
Cersei’s
mouth
was
dry.
I
need
a
cup
of
Arbor
gold.
If
the
ironmen
decided
to
take
the
Arbor
next,
the
whole
realm
might
soon
be
going
thirsty.
“Stannis
may
have
had
a
hand
in
this.
Balon
Greyjoy
offered
my
lord
father
an
alliance.
Perhaps
his
son
has
offered
one
to
Stannis.”

Pycelle
frowned.
“What
would
Lord
Stannis
gain
by...”

“He
gains
another
foothold.
And
plunder,
that
as
well.
Stannis
needs
gold
to
pay
his
sellswords.
By
raiding
in
the
west,
he
hopes
he
can
distract
us
from
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End.”

Lord
Merryweather
nodded.
“A
diversion.
Stannis
is
more
cunning
than
we
knew.
Your
Grace
is
clever
to
have
seen
through
his
ploy.”

“Lord
Stannis
is
striving
to
win
the
northmen
to
his
cause,”
said
Pycelle.
“If
he
befriends
the
ironborn,
he
cannot
hope...”

“The
northmen
will
not
have
him,”
said
Cersei,
wondering
how
such
a
learned
man
could
be
so
stupid.
“Lord
Manderly
hacked
the
head
and
hands
off
the
onion
knight,
we
have
that
from
the
Freys,
and
half
a
dozen
other
northern
lords
have
rallied
to
Lord
Bolton.
The
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend.
Where
else
can
Stannis
turn,
but
to
the
ironmen
and
the
wildlings,
the
enemies
of
the
north?
But
if
he
thinks
that
I
am
going
to
walk
into
his
trap,
he
is
a
bigger
fool
than
you.”
She
turned
back
to
the
little
queen.
“The
Shield
Islands
belong
to
the
Reach.
Grimm
and
Serry
and
the
rest
are
sworn
to
Highgarden.
It
is
for
Highgarden
to
answer
this.”

“Highgarden
shall
answer,”
said
Margaery
Tyrell.
“Willas
has
sent
word
to
Leyton
Hightower
in
Oldtown,
so
he
can
see
to
his
own
defenses.
Garlan
is
gathering
men
to
retake
the
isles.
The
best
part
of
our
power
remains
with
my
lord
father,
though.
We
must
send
word
to
him
at
Storm’s
End.
At
once.”

“And
lift
the
siege?”
Cersei
did
not
care
for
Margaery’s
presumption.
She
says
“at
once”
to
me.
Does
she
take
me
for
her
handmaid?
“I
have
no
doubt
that
Lord
Stannis
would
be
pleased
by
that.
Have
you
been
listening,
my
lady?
If
he
can
draw
our
eyes
away
from
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End
to
these
rocks...”

“Rocks?”
gasped
Margaery.
“Did
Your
Grace
say
rocks?”

The
Knight
of
Flowers
put
a
hand
upon
his
sister’s
shoulder.
“If
it
please
Your
Grace,
from
those
rocks
the
ironmen
threaten
Oldtown
and
the
Arbor.
From
strongholds
on
the
Shields,
raiders
can
sail
up
the
Mander
into
the
very
heart
of
the
Reach,
as
they
did
of
old.
With
enough
men
they
might
even
threaten
Highgarden.”

“Truly?”
said
the
queen,
all
innocence.
“Why
then,
your
brave
brothers
had
best
roust
them
off
those
rocks,
and
quickly.”

“How
would
the
queen
suggest
they
accomplish
that,
without
sufficient
ships?”
asked
Ser
Loras.
“Willas
and
Garlan
can
raise
ten
thousand
men
within
a
fortnight
and
twice
that
in
a
moon’s
turn,
but
they
cannot
walk
on
water,
Your
Grace.”

“Highgarden
sits
above
the
Mander,”
Cersei
reminded
him.
“You
and
your
vassals
command
a
thousand
leagues
of
coast.
Are
there
no
fisherfolk
along
your
shores?
Do
you
have
no
pleasure
barges,
no
ferries,
no
river
galleys,
no
skiffs?”

“Many
and
more,”
Ser
Loras
admitted.

“Such
should
be
more
than
sufficient
to
carry
a
host
across
a
little
stretch
of
water,
I
would
think.”

“And
when
the
longships
of
the
ironborn
descend
upon
our
ragtag
fleet
as
it
is
making
its
way
across
this
‘little
stretch
of
water,’
what
would
Your
Grace
have
us
do
then?”

Drown,
thought
Cersei.
“Highgarden
has
gold
as
well.
You
have
my
leave
to
hire
sellsails
from
beyond
the
narrow
sea.”

“Pirates
out
of
Myr
and
Lys,
you
mean?”
Loras
said
with
contempt.
“The
scum
of
the
Free
Cities?”

He
is
as
insolent
as
his
sister.
“Sad
to
say,
all
of
us
must
deal
with
scum
from
time
to
time,”
she
said
with
poisonous
sweetness.
“Perhaps
you
have
a
better
notion?”

“Only
the
Arbor
has
sufficient
galleys
to
retake
the
mouth
of
the
Mander
from
the
ironmen
and
protect
my
brothers
from
their
longships
during
their
crossing.
I
beg
Your
Grace,
send
word
to
Dragonstone
and
command
Lord
Redwyne
to
raise
his
sails
at
once.”

At
least
he
has
the
sense
to
beg.
Paxter
Redwyne
owned
two
hundred
warships,
and
five
times
as
many
merchant
carracks,
wine
cogs,
trading
galleys,
and
whalers.
Redwyne
was
encamped
beneath
the
walls
of
Dragonstone,
however,
and
the
greater
part
of
his
fleet
was
engaged
in
ferrying
men
across
Blackwater
Bay
for
the
assault
on
that
island
stronghold.
The
remainder
prowled
Shipbreaker
Bay
to
the
south,
where
only
their
presence
prevented
Storm’s
End
from
being
resupplied
by
sea.

Aurane
Waters
bristled
at
Ser
Loras’s
suggestion.
“If
Lord
Redwyne
sails
his
ships
away,
how
are
we
to
supply
our
men
on
Dragonstone?
Without
the
Arbor’s
galleys,
how
will
we
maintain
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End?”

“The
siege
can
be
resumed
later,
after—”

Cersei
cut
him
off.
“Storm’s
End
is
a
hundred
times
more
valuable
than
the
Shields,
and
Dragonstone...
so
long
as
Dragonstone
remains
in
the
hands
of
Stannis
Baratheon,
it
is
a
knife
at
my
son’s
throat.
We
will
release
Lord
Redwyne
and
his
fleet
when
the
castle
falls.”
The
queen
pushed
herself
to
her
feet.
“This
audience
is
at
an
end.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
a
word.”

The
old
man
started,
as
if
her
voice
had
woken
him
from
some
dream
of
youth,
but
before
he
could
answer,
Loras
Tyrell
strode
forward,
so
swiftly
that
the
queen
drew
back
in
alarm.
She
was
about
to
shout
for
Ser
Osmund
to
defend
her
when
the
Knight
of
Flowers
sank
to
one
knee.
“Your
Grace,
let
me
take
Dragonstone.”

His
sister’s
hand
went
to
her
mouth.
“Loras,
no.”

Ser
Loras
ignored
her
plea.
“It
will
take
half
a
year
or
more
to
starve
Dragonstone
into
submission,
as
Lord
Paxter
means
to
do.
Give
me
the
command,
Your
Grace.
The
castle
will
be
yours
within
a
fortnight
if
I
have
to
tear
it
down
with
my
bare
hands.”

No
one
had
given
Cersei
such
a
lovely
gift
since
Sansa
Stark
had
run
to
her
to
divulge
Lord
Eddard’s
plans.
She
was
pleased
to
see
that
Margaery
had
gone
pale.
“Your
courage
takes
my
breath
away,
Ser
Loras,”
Cersei
said.
“Lord
Waters,
are
any
of
the
new
dromonds
fit
to
put
to
sea?”

“Sweet
Cersei
is,
Your
Grace.
A
swift
ship,
and
as
strong
as
the
queen
she’s
named
for.”

“Splendid.
Let
Sweet
Cersei
carry
our
Knight
of
Flowers
to
Dragonstone
at
once.
Ser
Loras,
the
command
is
yours.
Swear
to
me
that
you
shall
not
return
until
Dragonstone
is
Tommen’s.”

“I
shall,
Your
Grace.”
He
rose.

Cersei
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks.
She
kissed
his
sister
too,
and
whispered,
“You
have
a
gallant
brother.”
Either
Margaery
did
not
have
the
grace
to
answer
or
fear
had
stolen
all
her
words.

Dawn
was
still
several
hours
away
when
Cersei
slipped
out
the
king’s
door
behind
the
Iron
Throne.
Ser
Osmund
went
before
her
with
a
torch
and
Qyburn
strolled
along
beside
her.
Pycelle
had
to
struggle
to
keep
up.
“If
it
please
Your
Grace,”
he
puffed,
“young
men
are
overbold,
and
think
only
of
the
glory
of
battle
and
never
of
its
dangers.
Ser
Loras...
this
plan
of
his
is
fraught
with
peril.
To
storm
the
very
walls
of
Dragonstone...”

“...is
very
brave.”

“...brave,
yes,
but...”

“I
have
no
doubt
that
our
Knight
of
Flowers
will
be
the
first
man
to
gain
the
battlements.”
And
perhaps
the
first
to
fall.
The
pox-scarred
bastard
that
Stannis
had
left
to
hold
his
castle
was
no
callow
tourney
champion
but
a
seasoned
killer.
If
the
gods
were
good,
he
would
give
Ser
Loras
the
glorious
end
he
seemed
to
want.
Assuming
the
boy
does
not
drown
on
the
way.
There
had
been
another
storm
last
night,
a
savage
one.
The
rain
had
come
down
in
black
sheets
for
hours.
And
wouldn’t
that
be
sad?
the
queen
mused.
Drowning
is
ordinary.
Ser
Loras
lusts
for
glory
as
real
men
lust
for
women,
the
least
the
gods
can
do
is
grant
him
a
death
worthy
of
a
song.

No
matter
what
befell
the
boy
on
Dragonstone,
however,
the
queen
would
be
the
winner.
If
Loras
took
the
castle,
Stannis
would
suffer
a
grievous
blow,
and
the
Redwyne
fleet
could
sail
off
to
meet
the
ironmen.
If
he
failed,
she
would
see
to
it
that
he
had
the
lion’s
share
of
the
blame.
Nothing
tarnishes
a
hero
as
much
as
failure.
And
if
he
should
come
home
on
his
shield,
covered
in
blood
and
glory,
Ser
Osney
will
be
there
to
console
his
grieving
sister.

The
laugh
would
not
be
contained
any
longer.
It
burst
from
Cersei’s
lips,
and
echoed
down
the
hall.

“Your
Grace?”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
blinked,
his
mouth
sagging
open.
“Why...
why
would
you
laugh?”

“Why,”
she
had
to
say,
“elsewise
I
might
weep.
My
heart
is
bursting
with
love
for
our
Ser
Loras
and
his
valor.”

She
left
the
Grand
Maester
on
the
serpentine
steps.
That
one
has
outlived
any
usefulness
he
ever
had,
the
queen
decided.
All
Pycelle
ever
seemed
to
do
of
late
was
plague
her
with
cautions
and
objections.
He
had
even
objected
to
the
understanding
she
had
reached
with
the
High
Septon,
gaping
at
her
with
dim
and
rheumy
eyes
when
she
commanded
him
to
prepare
the
necessary
papers
and
babbling
about
old
dead
history
until
Cersei
cut
him
off.
“King
Maegor’s
day
is
done,
and
so
are
his
decrees,”
she
said
firmly.
“This
is
King
Tommen’s
day,
and
mine.”
I
would
have
done
better
to
let
him
perish
in
the
black
cells.

“Should
Ser
Loras
fall,
Your
Grace
will
need
to
find
another
worthy
for
the
Kingsguard,”
Lord
Qyburn
said
as
they
crossed
over
the
spiked
moat
that
girded
Maegor’s
Holdfast.

“Someone
splendid,”
she
agreed.
“Someone
so
young
and
swift
and
strong
that
Tommen
will
forget
all
about
Ser
Loras.
A
bit
of
gallantry
would
not
be
amiss,
but
his
head
should
not
be
full
of
foolish
notions.
Do
you
know
of
such
a
man?”

“Alas,
no,”
said
Qyburn.
“I
had
another
sort
of
champion
in
mind.
What
he
lacks
in
gallantry
he
will
give
you
tenfold
in
devotion.
He
will
protect
your
son,
kill
your
enemies,
and
keep
your
secrets,
and
no
living
man
will
be
able
to
withstand
him.”

“So
you
say.
Words
are
wind.
When
the
hour
is
ripe,
you
may
produce
this
paragon
of
yours
and
we
will
see
if
he
is
all
that
you
have
promised.”

“They
will
sing
of
him,
I
swear
it.”
Lord
Qyburn’s
eyes
crinkled
with
amusement.
“Might
I
ask
about
the
armor?”

“I
have
placed
your
order.
The
armorer
thinks
that
I
am
mad.
He
assures
me
that
no
man
is
strong
enough
to
move
and
fight
in
such
a
weight
of
plate.”
Cersei
gave
the
chainless
maester
a
warning
look.
“Play
me
for
a
fool,
and
you’ll
die
screaming.
You
are
aware
of
that,
I
trust?”

“Always,
Your
Grace.”

“Good.
Say
no
more
of
this.”

“The
queen
is
wise.
These
walls
have
ears.”

“So
they
do.”
At
night
Cersei
sometimes
heard
soft
sounds,
even
in
her
own
apartments.
Mice
in
the
walls,
she
would
tell
herself,
no
more
than
that.

A
candle
was
burning
by
her
bedside,
but
the
hearthfire
had
gone
out
and
there
was
no
other
light.
The
room
was
cold
as
well.
Cersei
undressed
and
slipped
beneath
the
blankets,
leaving
her
gown
to
puddle
on
the
floor.
Across
the
bed,
Taena
stirred.
“Your
Grace,”
she
murmured
softly.
“What
hour
is
it?”

“The
hour
of
the
owl,”
the
queen
replied.

Though
Cersei
often
slept
alone,
she
had
never
liked
it.
Her
oldest
memories
were
of
sharing
a
bed
with
Jaime,
when
they
had
still
been
so
young
that
no
one
could
tell
the
two
of
them
apart.
Later,
after
they
were
separated,
she’d
had
a
string
of
bedmaids
and
companions,
most
of
them
girls
of
an
age
with
her,
the
daughters
of
her
father’s
household
knights
and
bannermen.
None
had
pleased
her,
and
few
lasted
very
long.
Little
sneaks,
the
lot
of
them.
Vapid,
weepy
creatures,
always
telling
tales
and
trying
to
worm
their
way
between
me
and
Jaime.
Still,
there
had
been
nights
deep
within
the
black
bowels
of
the
Rock
when
she
had
welcomed
their
warmth
beside
her.
An
empty
bed
was
a
cold
bed.

Here
most
of
all.
There
were
chills
in
this
room,
and
her
wretched
royal
husband
had
died
beneath
this
canopy.
Robert
Baratheon,
the
First
of
His
Name,
may
there
never
be
a
second.
A
dim,
drunken
brute
of
a
man.
Let
him
weep
in
hell.
Taena
warmed
the
bed
as
well
as
Robert
ever
had,
and
never
tried
to
force
Cersei’s
legs
apart.
Of
late
she
had
shared
the
queen’s
bed
more
often
than
Lord
Merryweather’s.
Orton
did
not
seem
to
mind...
or
if
he
did,
he
knew
better
than
to
say
so.

“I
was
concerned
when
I
woke
and
found
you
gone,”
murmured
Lady
Merryweather,
sitting
up
against
the
pillows,
the
coverlets
tangled
about
her
waist.
“Is
aught
amiss?”

“No,”
said
Cersei,
“all
is
well.
On
the
morrow
Ser
Loras
will
sail
for
Dragonstone,
to
win
the
castle,
loose
the
Redwyne
fleet,
and
prove
his
manhood
to
us
all.”
She
told
the
Myrish
woman
all
that
had
occurred
beneath
the
shifting
shadow
of
the
Iron
Throne.
“Without
her
valiant
brother,
our
little
queen
is
next
to
naked.
She
has
her
guards,
to
be
sure,
but
I
have
their
captain
here
and
there
about
the
castle.
A
garrulous
old
man
with
a
squirrel
on
his
surcoat.
Squirrels
run
from
lions.
He
does
not
have
it
in
him
to
defy
the
Iron
Throne.”

“Margaery
has
other
swords
about
her,”
cautioned
Lady
Merryweather.
“She
has
made
many
friends
about
the
court,
and
she
and
her
young
cousins
all
have
admirers.”

“A
few
suitors
do
not
concern
me,”
Cersei
said.
“The
army
at
Storm’s
End,
however...”

“What
do
you
mean
to
do,
Your
Grace?”

“Why
do
you
ask?”
The
question
was
a
little
too
pointed
for
Cersei’s
taste.
“I
do
hope
you
are
not
thinking
of
sharing
my
idle
musings
with
our
poor
little
queen?”

“Never.
I
am
not
that
girl
Senelle.”

Cersei
did
not
care
to
think
about
Senelle.
She
repaid
my
kindness
with
betrayal.
Sansa
Stark
had
done
the
same.
So
had
Melara
Hetherspoon
and
fat
Jeyne
Farman
when
the
three
of
them
were
girls.
I
would
never
have
gone
into
that
tent
if
not
for
them.
I
would
never
have
allowed
Maggy
the
Frog
to
taste
my
morrows
in
a
drop
of
blood.
“I
would
be
very
sad
if
you
ever
betrayed
my
trust,
Taena.
I
would
have
no
choice
but
to
give
you
to
Lord
Qyburn,
but
I
know
that
I
should
weep.”

“I
will
never
give
you
cause
to
weep,
Your
Grace.
If
I
do,
say
the
word,
and
I
will
give
myself
to
Qyburn.
I
want
only
to
be
close
to
you.
To
serve
you,
however
you
require.”

“And
for
this
service,
what
reward
will
you
expect?”

“Nothing.
It
pleases
me
to
please
you.”
Taena
rolled
onto
her
side,
her
olive
skin
shining
in
the
candlelight.
Her
breasts
were
larger
than
the
queen’s
and
tipped
with
huge
nipples,
black
as
horn.
She
is
younger
than
I
am.
Her
breasts
have
not
begun
to
sag.
Cersei
wondered
what
it
would
feel
like
to
kiss
another
woman.
Not
lightly
on
the
cheek,
as
was
common
courtesy
amongst
ladies
of
high
birth,
but
full
upon
the
lips.
Taena’s
lips
were
very
full.
She
wondered
what
it
would
feel
like
to
suckle
on
those
breasts,
to
lay
the
Myrish
woman
on
her
back
and
push
her
legs
apart
and
use
her
as
a
man
would
use
her,
the
way
Robert
would
use
her
when
the
drink
was
in
him,
and
she
was
unable
to
bring
him
off
with
hand
or
mouth.

Those
had
been
the
worst
nights,
lying
helpless
underneath
him
as
he
took
his
pleasure,
stinking
of
wine
and
grunting
like
a
boar.
Usually
he
rolled
off
and
went
to
sleep
as
soon
as
it
was
done,
and
was
snoring
before
his
seed
could
dry
upon
her
thighs.
She
was
always
sore
afterward,
raw
between
the
legs,
her
breasts
painful
from
the
mauling
he
would
give
them.
The
only
time
he’d
ever
made
her
wet
was
on
their
wedding
night.

Robert
had
been
handsome
enough
when
they
first
married,
tall
and
strong
and
powerful,
but
his
hair
was
black
and
heavy,
thick
on
his
chest
and
coarse
around
his
sex.
The
wrong
man
came
back
from
the
Trident,
the
queen
would
sometimes
think
as
he
was
plowing
her.
In
the
first
few
years,
when
he
mounted
her
more
often,
she
would
close
her
eyes
and
pretend
that
he
was
Rhaegar.
She
could
not
pretend
that
he
was
Jaime;
he
was
too
different,
too
unfamiliar.
Even
the
smell
of
him
was
wrong.

For
Robert,
those
nights
never
happened.
Come
morning
he
remembered
nothing,
or
so
he
would
have
had
her
believe.
Once,
during
the
first
year
of
their
marriage,
Cersei
had
voiced
her
displeasure
the
next
day.
“You
hurt
me,”
she
complained.
He
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed.
“It
was
not
me,
my
lady,”
he
said
in
a
sulky
sullen
tone,
like
a
child
caught
stealing
apple
cakes
from
the
kitchen.
“It
was
the
wine.
I
drink
too
much
wine.”
To
wash
down
his
admission,
he
reached
for
his
horn
of
ale.
As
he
raised
it
to
his
mouth,
she
smashed
her
own
horn
in
his
face,
so
hard
she
chipped
a
tooth.
Years
later
at
a
feast,
she
heard
him
telling
a
serving
wench
how
he’d
cracked
the
tooth
in
a
mêlée.
Well,
our
marriage
was
a
mêlée,
she
reflected,
so
he
did
not
lie.

The
rest
had
all
been
lies,
though.
He
did
remember
what
he
did
to
her
at
night,
she
was
convinced
of
that.
She
could
see
it
in
his
eyes.
He
only
pretended
to
forget;
it
was
easier
to
do
that
than
to
face
his
shame.
Deep
down
Robert
Baratheon
was
a
coward.
In
time
the
assaults
did
grow
less
frequent.
During
the
first
year
he
took
her
at
least
once
a
fortnight;
by
the
end
it
was
not
even
once
a
year.
He
never
stopped
completely,
though.
Sooner
or
later
there
would
always
come
a
night
when
he
would
drink
too
much
and
want
to
claim
his
rights.
What
shamed
him
in
the
light
of
day
gave
him
pleasure
in
the
darkness.

“My
queen?”
said
Taena
Merryweather.
“You
have
a
strange
look
in
your
eyes.
Are
you
unwell?”

“I
was
just...
remembering.”
Her
throat
was
dry.
“You
are
a
good
friend,
Taena.
I
have
not
had
a
true
friend
in...”

Someone
hammered
at
the
door.

Again?
The
urgency
of
the
sound
made
her
shiver.
Have
another
thousand
ships
descended
on
us?
She
slipped
into
a
bedrobe
and
went
to
see
who
it
was.
“Beg
pardon
for
disturbing
you,
Your
Grace,”
the
guardsman
said,
“but
Lady
Stokeworth
is
below,
begging
audience.”

“At
this
hour?”
snapped
Cersei.
“Has
Falyse
lost
her
wits?
Tell
her
I
have
retired.
Tell
her
that
smallfolk
on
the
Shields
are
being
slaughtered.
Tell
her
that
I
have
been
awake
for
half
the
night.
I
will
see
her
on
the
morrow.”

The
guard
hesitated.
“If
it
please
Your
Grace,
she’s...
she’s
not
in
a
good
way,
if
you
take
my
meaning.”

Cersei
frowned.
She
had
assumed
Falyse
was
here
to
tell
her
that
Bronn
was
dead.
“Very
well.
I
shall
need
to
dress.
Take
her
to
my
solar
and
have
her
wait.”
When
Lady
Merryweather
made
to
rise
and
come
with
her,
the
queen
demurred.
“No,
stay.
One
of
us
should
get
some
rest,
at
least.
I
shan’t
be
long.”

Lady
Falyse’s
face
was
bruised
and
swollen,
her
eyes
red
from
her
tears.
Her
lower
lip
was
broken,
her
clothing
soiled
and
torn.
“Gods
be
good,”
Cersei
said
as
she
ushered
her
into
the
solar
and
closed
the
door.
“What
has
happened
to
your
face?”

Falyse
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
question.
“He
killed
him,”
she
said
in
a
quavery
voice.
“Mother
have
mercy,
he...
he...”
She
broke
down
sobbing,
her
whole
body
trembling.

Cersei
poured
a
cup
of
wine
and
took
it
to
the
weeping
woman.
“Drink
this.
The
wine
will
calm
you.
That’s
it.
A
little
more
now.
Stop
that
weeping
and
tell
me
why
you’re
here.”

It
took
the
rest
of
the
flagon
before
the
queen
was
finally
able
to
coax
the
whole
sad
tale
out
of
Lady
Falyse.
Once
she
had,
she
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
rage.
“Single
combat,”
she
repeated.
Is
there
no
one
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
that
I
can
rely
upon?
Am
I
the
only
one
in
Westeros
with
a
pinch
of
wits?
“You
are
telling
me
Ser
Balman
challenged
Bronn
to
single
combat?”

“He
said
it
would
be
s-s-simple.
The
lance
is
a
kn-knight’s
weapon,
he
said,
and
B-Bronn
was
no
true
knight.
Balman
said
he
would
unhorse
him
and
finish
him
as
he
lay
st-st-stunned.”

Bronn
was
no
knight,
that
was
true.
Bronn
was
a
battle-hardened
killer.
Your
cretin
of
a
husband
wrote
his
own
death
warrant.
“A
splendid
plan.
Dare
I
ask
how
it
went
awry?”

“B-Bronn
drove
his
lance
through
the
chest
of
Balman’s
poor
h-h-h-horse.
Balman,
he...
his
legs
were
crushed
when
the
beast
fell.
He
screamed
so
piteously...”

Sellswords
have
no
pity,
Cersei
might
have
said.
“I
asked
you
to
arrange
a
hunting
mishap.
An
arrow
gone
astray,
a
fall
from
a
horse,
an
angry
boar...
there
are
so
many
ways
a
man
can
die
in
the
woods.
None
of
them
involving
lances.”

Falyse
did
not
seem
to
hear
her.
“When
I
tried
to
run
to
my
Balman,
he,
he,
he
struck
me
in
the
face.
He
made
my
lord
c-c-confess.
Balman
was
crying
out
for
Maester
Frenken
to
attend
him,
but
the
sellsword,
he,
he,
he...”

“Confess?”
Cersei
did
not
like
that
word.
“I
trust
our
brave
Ser
Balman
held
his
tongue.”

“Bronn
put
a
dagger
in
his
eye,
and
told
me
I
had
best
be
gone
from
Stokeworth
before
the
sun
went
down
or
I’d
get
the
same.
He
said
he’d
pass
me
around
to
the
g-g-garrison,
if
any
of
them
would
have
me.
When
I
ordered
Bronn
seized,
one
of
his
knights
had
the
insolence
to
say
that
I
should
do
as
Lord
Stokeworth
said.
He
called
him
Lord
Stokeworth!”
Lady
Falyse
clutched
at
the
queen’s
hand.
“Your
Grace
must
give
me
knights.
A
hundred
knights!
And
crossbowmen,
to
take
my
castle
back.
Stokeworth
is
mine!
They
would
not
even
permit
me
to
gather
up
my
clothes!
Bronn
said
they
were
his
wife’s
clothes
now,
all
my
s-silks
and
velvets.”

Your
rags
are
the
least
of
your
concern.
The
queen
pulled
her
fingers
free
of
the
other
woman’s
clammy
grasp.
“I
asked
you
to
snuff
out
a
candle
to
help
protect
the
king.
Instead
you
heaved
a
pot
of
wildfire
at
it.
Did
your
witless
Balman
bring
my
name
into
this?
Tell
me
he
did
not.”

Falyse
licked
her
lips.
“He...
he
was
in
pain,
his
legs
were
broken.
Bronn
said
he
would
show
him
mercy,
but...
What
will
happen
to
my
poor
m-m-mother?”

I
imagine
she
will
die.
“What
do
you
think?”
Lady
Tanda
might
well
be
dead
already.
Bronn
did
not
seem
the
sort
of
man
who
would
expend
much
effort
nursing
an
old
woman
with
a
broken
hip.

“You
have
to
help
me.
Where
am
I
to
go?
What
will
I
do?”

Perhaps
you
might
wed
Moon
Boy,
Cersei
almost
said.
He
is
nigh
as
big
a
fool
as
your
late
husband.
She
could
not
risk
a
war
on
the
very
doorstep
of
King’s
Landing,
not
now.
“The
silent
sisters
are
always
glad
to
welcome
widows,”
she
said.
“Theirs
is
a
serene
life,
a
life
of
prayer
and
contemplation
and
good
works.
They
bring
solace
to
the
living
and
peace
to
the
dead.”
And
they
do
not
talk.
She
could
not
have
the
woman
running
about
the
Seven
Kingdoms
spreading
dangerous
tales.

Falyse
was
deaf
to
good
sense.
“All
we
did,
we
did
in
service
to
Your
Grace.
Proud
to
Be
Faithful.
You
said...”

“I
recall.”
Cersei
forced
a
smile.
“You
shall
stay
here
with
us,
my
lady,
until
such
time
as
we
find
a
way
to
win
your
castle
back.
Let
me
pour
you
another
cup
of
wine.
It
will
help
you
sleep.
You
are
weary
and
sick
of
heart,
that’s
plain
to
see.
My
poor
dear
Falyse.
That’s
it,
drink
up.”

As
her
guest
was
working
on
the
flagon,
Cersei
went
to
the
door
and
called
her
maids.
She
told
Dorcas
to
find
Lord
Qyburn
for
her
and
bring
him
here
at
once.
Jocelyn
Swyft
she
dispatched
to
the
kitchens.
“Bring
bread
and
cheese,
a
meat
pie
and
some
apples.
And
wine.
We
have
a
thirst.”

Qyburn
arrived
before
the
food.
Lady
Falyse
had
put
down
three
more
cups
by
then,
and
was
beginning
to
nod,
though
from
time
to
time
she
would
rouse
and
give
another
sob.
The
queen
took
Qyburn
aside
and
told
him
of
Ser
Balman’s
folly.
“I
cannot
have
Falyse
spreading
tales
about
the
city.
Her
grief
has
made
her
witless.
Do
you
still
need
women
for
your...
work?”

“I
do,
Your
Grace.
The
puppeteers
are
quite
used
up.”

“Take
her
and
do
with
her
as
you
will,
then.
But
once
she
goes
down
into
the
black
cells...
need
I
say
more?”

“No,
Your
Grace.
I
understand.”

“Good.”
The
queen
donned
her
smile
once
again.
“Sweet
Falyse,
Maester
Qyburn’s
here.
He’ll
help
you
rest.”

“Oh,”
said
Falyse
vaguely.
“Oh,
good.”

When
the
door
closed
behind
them
Cersei
poured
herself
another
cup
of
wine.
“I
am
surrounded
by
enemies
and
imbeciles,”
she
said.
She
could
not
even
trust
to
her
own
blood
and
kin,
nor
Jaime,
who
had
once
been
her
other
half.
He
was
meant
to
be
my
sword
and
shield,
my
strong
right
arm.
Why
does
he
insist
on
vexing
me?

Bronn
was
no
more
than
an
annoyance,
to
be
sure.
She
had
never
truly
believed
that
he
was
harboring
the
Imp.
Her
twisted
little
brother
was
too
clever
to
allow
Lollys
to
name
her
wretched
ill-begotten
bastard
after
him,
knowing
it
was
sure
to
draw
the
queen’s
wroth
down
upon
her.
Lady
Merryweather
had
pointed
that
out,
and
she
was
right.
The
mockery
was
almost
certainly
the
sellsword’s
doing.
She
could
picture
him
watching
his
wrinkled
red
stepson
sucking
on
one
of
Lollys’s
swollen
dugs,
a
cup
of
wine
in
his
hand
and
an
insolent
smile
on
his
face.
Grin
all
you
wish,
Ser
Bronn,
you’ll
be
screaming
soon
enough.
Enjoy
your
lackwit
lady
and
your
stolen
castle
whilst
you
can.
When
the
time
comes,
I
shall
swat
you
as
if
you
were
a
fly.
Perhaps
she
would
send
Loras
Tyrell
to
do
the
swatting,
if
the
Knight
of
Flowers
should
somehow
return
alive
from
Dragonstone.
That
would
be
delicious.
If
the
gods
were
good,
each
of
them
would
kill
the
other,
like
Ser
Arryk
and
Ser
Erryk.
As
for
Stokeworth...
no,
she
was
sick
of
thinking
about
Stokeworth.

Taena
had
drifted
back
to
sleep
by
the
time
the
queen
returned
to
the
bedchamber,
her
head
spinning.
Too
much
wine
and
too
little
sleep,
she
told
herself.
It
was
not
every
night
that
she
was
awakened
twice
with
such
desperate
tidings.
At
least
I
could
awaken.
Robert
would
have
been
too
drunk
to
rise,
let
alone
rule.
It
would
have
fallen
to
Jon
Arryn
to
deal
with
all
of
this.
It
pleased
her
to
think
that
she
made
a
better
king
than
Robert.

The
sky
outside
the
window
was
already
beginning
to
lighten.
Cersei
sat
on
the
bed
beside
Lady
Merryweather,
listening
to
her
soft
breathing,
watching
her
breasts
rise
and
fall.
Does
she
dream
of
Myr?
she
wondered.
Or
is
it
her
lover
with
the
scar,
the
dangerous
dark-haired
man
who
would
not
be
refused?
She
was
quite
certain
Taena
was
not
dreaming
of
Lord
Orton.

Cersei
cupped
the
other
woman’s
breast.
Softly
at
first,
hardly
touching,
feeling
the
warmth
of
it
beneath
her
palm,
the
skin
as
smooth
as
satin.
She
gave
it
a
gentle
squeeze,
then
ran
her
thumbnail
lightly
across
the
big
dark
nipple,
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth
until
she
felt
it
stiffen.
When
she
glanced
up,
Taena’s
eyes
were
open.
“Does
that
feel
good?”
she
asked.

“Yes,”
said
Lady
Merryweather.

“And
this?”
Cersei
pinched
the
nipple
now,
pulling
on
it
hard,
twisting
it
between
her
fingers.

The
Myrish
woman
gave
a
gasp
of
pain.
“You’re
hurting
me.”

“It’s
just
the
wine.
I
had
a
flagon
with
my
supper,
and
another
with
the
widow
Stokeworth.
I
had
to
drink
to
keep
her
calm.”
She
twisted
Taena’s
other
nipple
too,
pulling
until
the
other
woman
gasped.
“I
am
the
queen.
I
mean
to
claim
my
rights.”

“Do
what
you
will.”
Taena’s
hair
was
as
black
as
Robert’s,
even
down
between
her
legs,
and
when
Cersei
touched
her
there
she
found
her
hair
all
sopping
wet,
where
Robert’s
had
been
coarse
and
dry.
“Please,”
the
Myrish
woman
said,
“go
on,
my
queen.
Do
as
you
will
with
me.
I’m
yours.”

But
it
was
no
good.
She
could
not
feel
it,
whatever
Robert
felt
on
the
nights
he
took
her.
There
was
no
pleasure
in
it,
not
for
her.
For
Taena,
yes.
Her
nipples
were
two
black
diamonds,
her
sex
slick
and
steamy.
Robert
would
have
loved
you,
for
an
hour.
The
queen
slid
a
finger
into
that
Myrish
swamp,
then
another,
moving
them
in
and
out,
but
once
he
spent
himself
inside
you,
he
would
have
been
hard-pressed
to
recall
your
name.

She
wanted
to
see
if
it
would
be
as
easy
with
a
woman
as
it
had
always
been
with
Robert.
Ten
thousand
of
your
children
perished
in
my
palm,
Your
Grace,
she
thought,
slipping
a
third
finger
into
Myr.
Whilst
you
snored,
I
would
lick
your
sons
off
my
face
and
fingers
one
by
one,
all
those
pale
sticky
princes.
You
claimed
your
rights,
my
lord,
but
in
the
darkness
I
would
eat
your
heirs.
Taena
gave
a
shudder.
She
gasped
some
words
in
a
foreign
tongue,
then
shuddered
again
and
arched
her
back
and
screamed.
She
sounds
as
if
she
is
being
gored,
the
queen
thought.
For
a
moment
she
let
herself
imagine
that
her
fingers
were
a
bore’s
tusks,
ripping
the
Myrish
woman
apart
from
groin
to
throat.

It
was
still
no
good.

It
had
never
been
any
good
with
anyone
but
Jaime.

When
she
tried
to
take
her
hand
away,
Taena
caught
it
and
kissed
her
fingers.
“Sweet
queen,
how
shall
I
pleasure
you?”
She
slid
her
hand
down
Cersei’s
side
and
touched
her
sex.
“Tell
me
what
you
would
have
of
me,
my
love.”

“Leave
me.”
Cersei
rolled
away
and
pulled
up
the
bedclothes
to
cover
herself,
shivering.
Dawn
was
breaking.
It
would
be
morning
soon,
and
all
of
this
would
be
forgotten.

It
had
never
happened.
=======
weirwood
to
take
root
here.
So
the
Lords
of
the
Eyrie
planted
grass
and
scattered
statuary
amidst
low,
flowering
shrubs.
It
was
there
the
two
champions
would
meet
to
place
their
lives,
and
that
of
Tyrion
Lannister,
into
the
hands
of
the
gods.

Lysa,
freshly
scrubbed
and
garbed
in
cream
velvet
with
a
rope
of
sapphires
and
moonstones
around
her
milk-white
neck,
was
holding
court
on
the
terrace
overlooking
the
scene
of
the
combat,
surrounded
by
her
knights,
retainers,
and
lords
high
and
low.
Most
of
them
still
hoped
to
wed
her,
bed
her,
and
rule
the
Vale
of
Arryn
by
her
side.
From
what
Catelyn
had
seen
during
her
stay
at
the
Eyrie,
it
was
a
vain
hope.

A
wooden
platform
had
been
built
to
elevate
Robert’s
chair;
there
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
sat,
giggling
and
clapping
his
hands
as
a
humpbacked
puppeteer
in
blue-and-white
motley
made
two
wooden
knights
hack
and
slash
at
each
other.
Pitchers
of
thick
cream
and
baskets
of
blackberries
had
been
set
out,
and
the
guests
were
sipping
a
sweet
orange-scented
wine
from
engraved
silver
cups.
A
fool’s
festival,
Brynden
had
called
it,
and
small
wonder.

Across
the
terrace,
Lysa
laughed
gaily
at
some
jest
of
Lord
Hunter’s,
and
nibbled
a
blackberry
from
the
point
of
Ser
Lyn
Corbray’s
dagger.
They
were
the
suitors
who
stood
highest
in
Lysa’s
favor…
today,
at
least.
Catelyn
would
have
been
hard-pressed
to
say
which
man
was
more
unsuitable.
Eon
Hunter
was
even
older
than
Jon
Arryn
had
been,
half-crippled
by
gout,
and
cursed
with
three
quarrelsome
sons,
each
more
grasping
than
the
last.
Ser
Lyn
was
a
different
sort
of
folly;
lean
and
handsome,
heir
to
an
ancient
but
impoverished
house,
but
vain,
reckless,
hot-tempered…
and,
it
was
whispered,
notoriously
uninterested
in
the
intimate
charms
of
women.

When
Lysa
espied
Catelyn,
she
welcomed
her
with
a
sisterly
embrace
and
a
moist
kiss
on
the
cheek.
“Isn’t
it
a
lovely
morning?
The
gods
are
smiling
on
us.
Do
try
a
cup
of
the
wine,
sweet
sister.
Lord
Hunter
was
kind
enough
to
send
for
it,
from
his
own
cellars.”

“Thank
you,
no.
Lysa,
we
must
talk.”

“After,”
her
sister
promised,
already
beginning
to
turn
away
from
her.

“Now.”
Catelyn
spoke
more
loudly
than
she’d
intended.
Men
were
turning
to
look.
“Lysa,
you
cannot
mean
to
go
ahead
with
this
folly.
Alive,
the
Imp
has
value.
Dead,
he
is
only
food
for
crows.
And
if
his
champion
should
prevail
here—”

“Small
chance
of
that,
my
lady,”
Lord
Hunter
assured
her,
patting
her
shoulder
with
a
liver-spotted
hand.
“Ser
Vardis
is
a
doughty
fighter.
He
will
make
short
work
of
the
sellsword.”

“Will
he,
my
lord?”
Catelyn
said
coolly.
“I
wonder.”
She
had
seen
Bronn
fight
on
the
high
road;
it
was
no
accident
that
he
had
survived
the
journey
while
other
men
had
died.
He
moved
like
a
panther,
and
that
ugly
sword
of
his
seemed
a
part
of
his
arm.

Lysa’s
suitors
were
gathering
around
them
like
bees
round
a
blossom.
“Women
understand
little
of
these
things,”
Ser
Morton
Waynwood
said.
“Ser
Vardis
is
a
knight,
sweet
lady.
This
other
fellow,
well,
his
sort
are
all
cowards
at
heart.
Useful
enough
in
a
battle,
with
thousands
of
their
fellows
around
them,
but
stand
them
up
alone
and
the
manhood
leaks
right
out
of
them.”

“Say
you
have
the
truth
of
it,
then,”
Catelyn
said
with
a
courtesy
that
made
her
mouth
ache.
“What
will
we
gain
by
the
dwarf’s
death?
Do
you
imagine
that
Jaime
will
care
a
fig
that
we
gave
his
brother
a
trial
before
we
flung
him
off
a
mountain?”

“Behead
the
man,”
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
suggested.
“When
the
Kingslayer
receives
the
Imp’s
head,
it
will
be
a
warning
to
him,”

Lysa
gave
an
impatient
shake
of
her
waist-long
auburn
hair.
“Lord
Robert
wants
to
see
him
fly,”
she
said,
as
if
that
settled
the
matter.
“And
the
Imp
has
only
himself
to
blame.
It
was
he
who
demanded
a
trial
by
combat.”

“Lady
Lysa
had
no
honorable
way
to
deny
him,
even
if
she’d
wished
to,”
Lord
Hunter
intoned
ponderously.

Ignoring
them
all,
Catelyn
turned
all
her
force
on
her
sister.
“I
remind
you,
Tyrion
Lannister
is
my
prisoner.”

“And
I
remind
you,
the
dwarf
murdered
my
lord
husband!”
Her
voice
rose.
“He
poisoned
the
Hand
of
the
King
and
left
my
sweet
baby
fatherless,
and
now
I
mean
to
see
him
pay!”
Whirling,
her
skirts
swinging
around
her,
Lysa
stalked
across
the
terrace.
Ser
Lyn
and
Ser
Morton
and
the
other
suitors
excused
themselves
with
cool
nods
and
trailed
after
her.

“Do
you
think
he
did?”
Ser
Rodrik
asked
her
quietly
when
they
were
alone
again.
“Murder
Lord
Jon,
that
is?
The
Imp
still
denies
it,
and
most
fiercely…”

“I
believe
the
Lannisters
murdered
Lord
Arryn,”
Catelyn
replied,
“but
whether
it
was
Tyrion,
or
Ser
Jaime,
or
the
queen,
or
all
of
them
together,
I
could
not
begin
to
say.”
Lysa
had
named
Cersei
in
the
letter
she
had
sent
to
Winterfell,
but
now
she
seemed
certain
that
Tyrion
was
the
killer…
perhaps
because
the
dwarf
was
here,
while
the
queen
was
safe
behind
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
hundreds
of
leagues
to
the
south.
Catelyn
almost
wished
she
had
burned
her
sister’s
letter
before
reading
it.

Ser
Rodrik
tugged
at
his
whiskers.
“Poison,
well…
that
could
be
the
dwarf’s
work,
true
enough.
Or
Cersei’s.
It’s
said
poison
is
a
woman’s
weapon,
begging
your
pardons,
my
lady.
The
Kingslayer,
now…
I
have
no
great
liking
for
the
man,
but
he’s
not
the
sort.
Too
fond
of
the
sight
of
blood
on
that
golden
sword
of
his.
Was
it
poison,
my
lady?”

Catelyn
frowned,
vaguely
uneasy.
“How
else
could
they
make
it
look
a
natural
death?”
Behind
her,
Lord
Robert
shrieked
with
delight
as
one
of
the
puppet
knights
sliced
the
other
in
half,
spilling
a
flood
of
red
sawdust
onto
the
terrace.
She
glanced
at
her
nephew
and
sighed.
“The
boy
is
utterly
without
discipline.
He
will
never
be
strong
enough
to
rule
unless
he
is
taken
away
from
his
mother
for
a
time.”

“His
lord
father
agreed
with
you,”
said
a
voice
at
her
elbow.
She
turned
to
behold
Maester
Colemon,
a
cup
of
wine
in
his
hand.
“He
was
planning
to
send
the
boy
to
Dragonstone
for
fostering,
you
know…
oh,
but
I’m
speaking
out
of
turn.”
The
apple
of
his
throat
bobbed
anxiously
beneath
the
loose
maester’s
chain.
“I
fear
I’ve
had
too
much
of
Lord
Hunter’s
excellent
wine.
The
prospect
of
bloodshed
has
my
nerves
all
a-fray…”

“You
are
mistaken,
Maester,”
Catelyn
said.
“It
was
Casterly
Rock,
not
Dragonstone,
and
those
arrangements
were
made
after
the
Hand’s
death,
without
my
sister’s
consent.”

The
maester’s
head
jerked
so
vigorously
at
the
end
of
his
absurdly
long
neck
that
he
looked
half
a
puppet
himself.
“No,
begging
your
forgiveness,
my
lady,
but
it
was
Lord
Jon
who—”

A
bell
tolled
loudly
below
them.
High
lords
and
serving
girls
alike
broke
off
what
they
were
doing
and
moved
to
the
balustrade.
Below,
two
guardsmen
in
sky-blue
cloaks
led
forth
Tyrion
Lannister.
The
Eyrie’s
plump
septon
escorted
him
to
the
statue
in
the
center
of
the
garden,
a
weeping
woman
carved
in
veined
white
marble,
no
doubt
meant
to
be
Alyssa.

“The
bad
little
man,”
Lord
Robert
said,
giggling.
“Mother,
can
I
make
him
fly?
I
want
to
see
him
fly.”

“Later,
my
sweet
baby,”
Lysa
promised
him.

“Trial
first,”
drawled
Ser
Lyn
Corbray,
“then
execution.”

A
moment
later
the
two
champions
appeared
from
opposite
sides
of
the
garden.
The
knight
was
attended
by
two
young
squires,
the
sellsword
by
the
Eyrie’s
master-at-arms.

Ser
Vardis
Egen
was
steel
from
head
to
heel,
encased
in
heavy
plate
armor
over
mail
and
padded
surcoat.
Large
circular
rondels,
enameled
cream-and-blue
in
the
moon-and-falcon
sigil
of
House
Arryn,
protected
the
vulnerable
juncture
of
arm
and
breast.
A
skirt
of
lobstered
metal
covered
him
from
waist
to
midthigh,
while
a
solid
gorget
encircled
his
throat.
Falcon’s
wings
sprouted
from
the
temples
of
his
helm,
and
his
visor
was
a
pointed
metal
beak
with
a
narrow
slit
for
vision.

Bronn
was
so
lightly
armored
he
looked
almost
naked
beside
the
knight.
He
wore
only
a
shirt
of
black
oiled
ringmail
over
boiled
leather,
a
round
steel
halfhelm
with
a
noseguard,
and
a
mail
coif.
High
leather
boots
with
steel
shinguards
gave
some
protection
to
his
legs,
and
discs
of
black
iron
were
sewn
into
the
fingers
of
his
gloves.
Yet
Catelyn
noted
that
the
sellsword
stood
half
a
hand
taller
than
his
foe,
with
a
longer
reach…
and
Bronn
was
fifteen
years
younger,
if
she
was
any
judge.

They
knelt
in
the
grass
beneath
the
weeping
woman,
facing
each
other,
with
Lannister
between
them.
The
septon
removed
a
faceted
crystal
sphere
from
the
soft
cloth
bag
at
his
waist.
He
lifted
it
high
above
his
head,
and
the
light
shattered.
Rainbows
danced
across
the
Imp’s
face.
In
a
high,
solemn,
singsong
voice,
the
septon
asked
the
gods
to
look
down
and
bear
witness,
to
find
the
truth
in
this
man’s
soul,
to
grant
him
life
and
freedom
if
he
was
innocent,
death
if
he
was
guilty.
His
voice
echoed
off
the
surrounding
towers.

When
the
last
echo
had
died
away,
the
septon
lowered
his
crystal
and
made
a
hasty
departure.
Tyrion
leaned
over
and
whispered
something
in
Bronn’s
ear
before
the
guardsmen
led
him
away.
The
sellsword
rose
laughing
and
brushed
a
blade
of
grass
from
his
knee.

Robert
Arryn,
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale,
was
fidgeting
impatiently
in
his
elevated
chair.
“When
are
they
going
to
fight?”
he
asked
plaintively.

Ser
Vardis
was
helped
back
to
his
feet
by
one
of
his
squires.
The
other
brought
him
a
triangular
shield
almost
four
feet
tall,
heavy
oak
dotted
with
iron
studs.
They
strapped
it
to
his
left
forearm.
When
Lysa’s
master-at-arms
offered
Bronn
a
similar
shield,
the
sellsword
spat
and
waved
it
away.
Three
days
growth
of
coarse
black
beard
covered
his
jaw
and
cheeks,
but
if
he
did
not
shave
it
was
not
for
want
of
a
razor;
the
edge
of
his
sword
had
the
dangerous
glimmer
of
steel
that
had
been
honed
every
day
for
hours,
until
it
was
too
sharp
to
touch.

Ser
Vardis
held
out
a
gauntleted
hand,
and
his
squire
placed
a
handsome
double-edged
longsword
in
his
grasp.
The
blade
was
engraved
with
a
delicate
silver
tracery
of
a
mountain
sky;
its
pommel
was
a
falcon’s
head,
its
crossguard
fashioned
into
the
shape
of
wings.
“I
had
that
sword
crafted
for
Jon
in
King’s
Landing,”
Lysa
told
her
guests
proudly
as
they
watched
Ser
Vardis
try
a
practice
cut.
“He
wore
it
whenever
he
sat
the
Iron
Throne
in
King
Robert’s
place.
Isn’t
it
a
lovely
thing?
I
thought
it
only
fitting
that
our
champion
avenge
Jon
with
his
own
blade.”

The
engraved
silver
blade
was
beautiful
beyond
a
doubt,
but
it
seemed
to
Catelyn
that
Ser
Vardis
might
have
been
more
comfortable
with
his
own
sword.
Yet
she
said
nothing;
she
was
weary
of
futile
arguments
with
her
sister.

“Make
them
fight!”
Lord
Robert
called
out.

Ser
Vardis
faced
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
lifted
his
sword
in
salute.
“For
the
Eyrie
and
the
Vale!”

Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
seated
on
a
balcony
across
the
garden,
flanked
by
his
guards.
It
was
to
him
that
Bronn
turned
with
a
cursory
salute.

“They
await
your
command,”
Lady
Lysa
said
to
her
lord
son.

“Fight!”
the
boy
screamed,
his
arms
trembling
as
they
clutched
at
his
chair.

Ser
Vardis
swiveled,
bringing
up
his
heavy
shield.
Bronn
turned
to
face
him.
Their
swords
rang
together,
once,
twice,
a
testing.
The
sellsword
backed
off
a
step.
The
knight
came
after,
holding
his
shield
before
him.
He
tried
a
slash,
but
Bronn
jerked
back,
just
out
of
reach,
and
the
silver
blade
cut
only
air.
Bronn
circled
to
his
right.
Ser
Vardis
turned
to
follow,
keeping
his
shield
between
them.
The
knight
pressed
forward,
placing
each
foot
carefully
on
the
uneven
ground.
The
sellsword
gave
way,
a
faint
smile
playing
over
his
lips.
Ser
Vardis
attacked,
slashing,
but
Bronn
leapt
away
from
him,
hopping
lightly
over
a
low,
moss-covered
stone.
Now
the
sellsword
circled
left,
away
from
the
shield,
toward
the
knight’s
unprotected
side.
Ser
Vardis
tried
a
hack
at
his
legs,
but
he
did
not
have
the
reach.
Bronn
danced
farther
to
his
left.
Ser
Vardis
turned
in
place.

“The
man
is
craven,”
Lord
Hunter
declared.
“Stand
and
fight,
coward!”
Other
voices
echoed
the
sentiment.

Catelyn
looked
to
Ser
Rodrik.
Her
master-at-arms
gave
a
curt
shake
of
his
head.
“He
wants
to
make
Ser
Vardis
chase
him.
The
weight
of
armor
and
shield
will
tire
even
the
strongest
man.”

She
had
seen
men
practice
at
their
swordplay
near
every
day
of
her
life,
had
viewed
half
a
hundred
tourneys
in
her
time,
but
this
was
something
different
and
deadlier:
a
dance
where
the
smallest
misstep
meant
death.
And
as
she
watched,
the
memory
of
another
duel
in
another
time
came
back
to
Catelyn
Stark,
as
vivid
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday.

They
met
in
the
lower
bailey
of
Riverrun.
When
Brandon
saw
that
Petyr
wore
only
helm
and
breastplate
and
mail,
he
took
off
most
of
his
armor.
Petyr
had
begged
her
for
a
favor
he
might
wear,
but
she
had
turned
him
away.
Her
lord
father
promised
her
to
Brandon
Stark,
and
so
it
was
to
him
that
she
gave
her
token,
a
pale
blue
handscarf
she
had
embroidered
with
the
leaping
trout
of
Riverrun.
As
she
pressed
it
into
his
hand,
she
pleaded
with
him.
“He
is
only
a
foolish
boy,
but
I
have
loved
him
like
a
brother.
It
would
grieve
me
to
see
him
die.”
And
her
betrothed
looked
at
her
with
the
cool
grey
eyes
of
a
Stark
and
promised
to
spare
the
boy
who
loved
her.

That
fight
was
over
almost
as
soon
as
it
began.
Brandon
was
a
man
grown,
and
he
drove
Littlefinger
all
the
way
across
the
bailey
and
down
the
water
stair,
raining
steel
on
him
with
every
step,
until
the
boy
was
staggering
and
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds.
“Yield!”
he
called,
more
than
once,
but
Petyr
would
only
shake
his
head
and
fight
on,
grimly.
When
the
river
was
lapping
at
their
ankles,
Brandon
finally
ended
it,
with
a
brutal
backhand
cut
that
bit
through
Petyr’s
rings
and
leather
into
the
soft
flesh
below
the
ribs,
so
deep
that
Catelyn
was
certain
that
the
wound
was
mortal.
He
looked
at
her
as
he
fell
and
murmured
“Cat”
as
the
bright
blood
came
flowing
out
between
his
mailed
fingers.
She
thought
she
had
forgotten
that.

That
was
the
last
time
she
had
seen
his
face…
until
the
day
she
was
brought
before
him
in
King’s
Landing.

A
fortnight
passed
before
Littlefinger
was
strong
enough
to
leave
Riverrun,
but
her
lord
father
forbade
her
to
visit
him
in
the
tower
where
he
lay
abed.
Lysa
helped
their
maester
nurse
him;
she
had
been
softer
and
shyer
in
those
days.
Edmure
had
called
on
him
as
well,
but
Petyr
had
sent
him
away.
Her
brother
had
acted
as
Brandon’s
squire
at
the
duel,
and
Littlefinger
would
not
forgive
that.
As
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
to
be
moved,
Lord
Hoster
Tully
sent
Petyr
Baelish
away
in
a
closed
litter,
to
finish
his
healing
on
the
Fingers,
upon
the
windswept
jut
of
rock
where
he’d
been
born.

The
ringing
clash
of
steel
on
steel
jarred
Catelyn
back
to
the
present.
Ser
Vardis
was
coming
hard
at
Bronn,
driving
into
him
with
shield
and
sword.
The
sellsword
scrambled
backward,
checking
each
blow,
stepping
lithely
over
rock
and
root,
his
eyes
never
leaving
his
foe.
He
was
quicker,
Catelyn
saw;
the
knight’s
silvered
sword
never
came
near
to
touching
him,
but
his
own
ugly
grey
blade
hacked
a
notch
from
Ser
Vardis’s
shoulder
plate.

The
brief
flurry
of
fighting
ended
as
swiftly
as
it
had
begun
when
Bronn
sidestepped
and
slid
behind
the
statue
of
the
weeping
woman.
Ser
Vardis
lunged
at
where
he
had
been,
striking
a
spark
off
the
pale
marble
of
Alyssa’s
thigh.

“They’re
not
fighting
good,
Mother,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
complained.
“I
want
them
to
fight.”

“They
will,
sweet
baby,”
his
mother
soothed
him.
“The
sellsword
can’t
run
all
day.”

Some
of
the
lords
on
Lysa’s
terrace
were
making
wry
jests
as
they
refilled
their
wine
cups,
but
across
the
garden,
Tyrion
Lannister’s
mismatched
eyes
watched
the
champions
dance
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
the
world.

Bronn
came
out
from
behind
the
statue
hard
and
fast,
still
moving
left,
aiming
a
two-handed
cut
at
the
knight’s
unshielded
right
side.
Ser
Vardis
blocked,
but
clumsily,
and
the
sellsword’s
blade
flashed
upward
at
his
head.
Metal
rang,
and
a
falcon’s
wing
collapsed
with
a
crunch.
Ser
Vardis
took
a
half
step
back
to
brace
himself,
raised
his
shield.
Oak
chips
flew
as
Bronn’s
sword
hacked
at
the
wooden
wall.
The
sellsword
stepped
left
again,
away
from
the
shield,
and
caught
Ser
Vardis
across
the
stomach,
the
razor
edge
of
his
blade
leaving
a
bright
gash
when
it
bit
into
the
knight’s
plate.

Ser
Vardis
drove
forward
off
his
back
foot,
his
own
silver
blade
descending
in
a
savage
arc.
Bronn
slammed
it
aside
and
danced
away.
The
knight
crashed
into
the
weeping
woman,
rocking
her
on
her
plinth.
Staggered,
he
stepped
backward,
his
head
turning
this
way
and
that
as
he
searched
for
his
foe.
The
slit
visor
of
his
helm
narrowed
his
vision.

“Behind
you,
ser!”
Lord
Hunter
shouted,
too
late.
Bronn
brought
his
sword
down
with
both
hands,
catching
Ser
Vardis
in
the
elbow
of
his
sword
arm.
The
thin
lobstered
metal
that
protected
the
joint
crunched.
The
knight
grunted,
turning,
wrenching
his
weapon
up.
This
time
Bronn
stood
his
ground.
The
swords
flew
at
each
other,
and
their
steel
song
filled
the
garden
and
rang
off
the
white
towers
of
the
Eyrie.

“Ser
Vardis
is
hurt,”
Ser
Rodrik
said,
his
voice
grave.

Catelyn
did
not
need
to
be
told;
she
had
eyes,
she
could
see
the
bright
finger
of
blood
running
along
the
knight’s
forearm,
the
wetness
inside
the
elbow
joint.
Every
parry
was
a
little
slower
and
a
little
lower
than
the
one
before.
Ser
Vardis
turned
his
side
to
his
foe,
trying
to
use
his
shield
to
block
instead,
but
Bronn
slid
around
him,
quick
as
a
cat.
The
sellsword
seemed
to
be
getting
stronger.
His
cuts
were
leaving
their
marks
now.
Deep
shiny
gashes
gleamed
all
over
the
knight’s
armor,
on
his
right
thigh,
his
beaked
visor,
crossing
on
his
breastplate,
a
long
one
along
the
front
of
his
gorget.
The
moon-and-falcon
rondel
over
Ser
Vardis’s
right
arm
was
sheared
clean
in
half,
hanging
by
its
strap.
They
could
hear
his
labored
breath,
rattling
through
the
air
holes
in
his
visor.

Blind
with
arrogance
as
they
were,
even
the
knights
and
lords
of
the
Vale
could
see
what
was
happening
below
them,
yet
her
sister
could
not.
“Enough,
Ser
Vardis!”
Lady
Lysa
called
down.
“Finish
him
now,
my
baby
is
growing
tired.”

And
it
must
be
said
of
Ser
Vardis
Egen
that
he
was
true
to
his
lady’s
command,
even
to
the
last.
One
moment
he
was
reeling
backward,
half-crouched
behind
his
scarred
shield;
the
next
he
charged.
The
sudden
bull
rush
caught
Bronn
off
balance.
Ser
Vardis
crashed
into
him
and
slammed
the
lip
of
his
shield
into
the
sellsword’s
face.
Almost,
almost,
Bronn
lost
his
feet…
he
staggered
back,
tripped
over
a
rock,
and
caught
hold
of
the
weeping
woman
to
keep
his
balance.
Throwing
aside
his
shield,
Ser
Vardis
lurched
after
him,
using
both
hands
to
raise
his
sword.
His
right
arm
was
blood
from
elbow
to
fingers
now,
yet
his
last
desperate
blow
would
have
opened
Bronn
from
neck
to
navel…
if
the
sellsword
had
stood
to
receive
it.

But
Bronn
jerked
back.
Jon
Arryn’s
beautiful
engraved
silver
sword
glanced
off
the
marble
elbow
of
the
weeping
woman
and
snapped
clean
a
third
of
the
way
up
the
blade.
Bronn
put
his
shoulder
into
the
statue’s
back.
The
weathered
likeness
of
Alyssa
Arryn
tottered
and
fell
with
a
great
crash,
and
Ser
Vardis
Egen
went
down
beneath
her.

Bronn
was
on
him
in
a
heartbeat,
kicking
what
was
left
of
his
shattered
rondel
aside
to
expose
the
weak
spot
between
arm
and
breastplate.
Ser
Vardis
was
lying
on
his
side,
pinned
beneath
the
broken
torso
of
the
weeping
woman.
Catelyn
heard
the
knight
groan
as
the
sellsword
lifted
his
blade
with
both
hands
and
drove
it
down
and
in
with
all
his
weight
behind
it,
under
the
arm
and
through
the
ribs.
Ser
Vardis
Egen
shuddered
and
lay
still.

Silence
hung
over
the
Eyrie.
Bronn
yanked
off
his
halfhelm
and
let
it
fall
to
the
grass.
His
lip
was
smashed
and
bloody
where
the
shield
had
caught
him,
and
his
coal-black
hair
was
soaked
with
sweat.
He
spit
out
a
broken
tooth.

“Is
it
over,
Mother?”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
asked.

No,
Catelyn
wanted
to
tell
him,
it’s
only
now
beginning.

“Yes,”
Lysa
said
glumly,
her
voice
as
cold
and
dead
as
the
captain
of
her
guard.

“Can
I
make
the
little
man
fly
now?”

Across
the
garden,
Tyrion
Lannister
got
to
his
feet.
“Not
this
little
man,”
he
said.
“This
little
man
is
going
down
in
the
turnip
hoist,
thank
you
very
much.”

“You
presume—”
Lysa
began.

“I
presume
that
House
Arryn
remembers
its
own
words,”
the
Imp
said.
“As
High
as
Honor.”

“You
promised
I
could
make
him
fly,”
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
screamed
at
his
mother.
He
began
to
shake.

Lady
Lysa’s
face
was
flushed
with
fury.
“The
gods
have
seen
fit
to
proclaim
him
innocent,
child.
We
have
no
choice
but
to
free
him.”
She
lifted
her
voice.
“Guards.
Take
my
lord
of
Lannister
and
his…
creature
here
out
of
my
sight.
Escort
them
to
the
Bloody
Gate
and
set
them
free.
See
that
they
have
horses
and
supplies
sufficient
to
reach
the
Trident,
and
make
certain
all
their
goods
and
weapons
are
returned
to
them.
They
shall
need
them
on
the
high
road.”

“The
high
road,”
Tyrion
Lannister
said.
Lysa
allowed
herself
a
faint,
satisfied
smile.
It
was
another
sort
of
death
sentence,
Catelyn
realized.
Tyrion
Lannister
must
know
that
as
well.
Yet
the
dwarf
favored
Lady
Arryn
with
a
mocking
bow.
“As
you
command,
my
lady,”
he
said.
“I
believe
we
know
the
way.”





JON

“You
are
as
hopeless
as
any
boys
I
have
ever
trained,”
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
announced
when
they
had
all
assembled
in
the
yard.
“Your
hands
were
made
for
manure
shovels,
not
for
swords,
and
if
it
were
up
to
me,
the
lot
of
you
would
be
set
to
herding
swine.
But
last
night
I
was
told
that
Gueren
is
marching
five
new
boys
up
the
kingsroad.
One
or
two
may
even
be
worth
the
price
of
piss.
To
make
room
for
them,
I
have
decided
to
pass
eight
of
you
on
to
the
Lord
Commander
to
do
with
as
he
will.”
He
called
out
the
names
one
by
one.
“Toad.
Stone
Head.
Aurochs.
Lover.
Pimple.
Monkey.
Ser
Loon.”
Last,
he
looked
at
Jon.
“And
the
Bastard.”

Pyp
let
fly
a
whoop
and
thrust
his
sword
into
the
air.
Ser
Alliser
fixed
him
with
a
reptile
stare.
“They
will
call
you
men
of
Night’s
Watch
now,
but
you
are
bigger
fools
than
the
Mummer’s
Monkey
here
if
you
believe
that.
You
are
boys
still,
green
and
stinking
of
summer,
and
when
the
winter
comes
you
will
die
like
flies.”
And
with
that,
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
took
his
leave
of
them.

The
other
boys
gathered
round
the
eight
who
had
been
named,
laughing
and
cursing
and
offering
congratulations.
Halder
smacked
Toad
on
the
butt
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
and
shouted,
“Toad,
of
the
Night’s
Watch!”
Yelling
that
a
black
brother
needed
a
horse,
Pyp
leapt
onto
Grenn’s
shoulders,
and
they
tumbled
to
the
ground,
rolling
and
punching
and
hooting.
Dareon
dashed
inside
the
armory
and
returned
with
a
skin
of
sour
red.
As
they
passed
the
wine
from
hand
to
hand,
grinning
like
fools,
Jon
noticed
Samwell
Tarly
standing
by
himself
beneath
a
bare
dead
tree
in
the
corner
of
the
yard.
Jon
offered
him
the
skin.
“A
swallow
of
wine?”

Sam
shook
his
head.
“No
thank
you,
Jon.”

“Are
you
well?”

“Very
well,
truly,”
the
fat
boy
lied.
“I
am
so
happy
for
you
all.”
His
round
face
quivered
as
he
forced
a
smile.
“You
will
be
First
Ranger
someday,
just
as
your
uncle
was.”

“Is,”
Jon
corrected.
He
would
not
accept
that
Benjen
Stark
was
dead.
Before
he
could
say
more,
Haider
cried,
“Here,
you
planning
to
drink
that
all
yourself?”
Pyp
snatched
the
skin
from
his
hand
and
danced
away,
laughing.
While
Grenn
seized
his
arm,
Pyp
gave
the
skin
a
squeeze,
and
a
thin
stream
of
red
squirted
Jon
in
the
face.
Haider
howled
in
protest
at
the
waste
of
good
wine.
Jon
sputtered
and
struggled.
Matthar
and
Jeren
climbed
the
wall
and
began
pelting
them
all
with
snowballs.

By
the
time
he
wrenched
free,
with
snow
in
his
hair
and
wine
stains
on
his
surcoat,
Samwell
Tarly
had
gone.

That
night,
Three-Finger
Hobb
cooked
the
boys
a
special
meal
to
mark
the
occasion.
When
Jon
arrived
at
the
common
hall,
the
Lord
Steward
himself
led
him
to
the
bench
near
the
fire.
The
older
men
clapped
him
on
the
arm
in
passing.
The
eight
soon-to-be
brothers
feasted
on
rack
of
lamb
baked
in
a
crust
of
garlic
and
herbs,
garnished
with
sprigs
of
mint,
and
surrounded
by
mashed
yellow
turnips
swimming
in
butter.
“From
the
Lord
Commander’s
own
table,”
Bowen
Marsh
told
them.
There
were
salads
of
spinach
and
chickpeas
and
turnip
greens,
and
afterward
bowls
of
iced
blueberries
and
sweet
cream.

“Do
you
think
they’ll
keep
us
together?”
Pyp
wondered
as
they
gorged
themselves
happily.

Toad
made
a
face.
“I
hope
not.
I’m
sick
of
looking
at
those
ears
of
yours.”

“Ho,”
said
Pyp.
“Listen
to
the
crow
call
the
raven
black.
You’re
certain
to
be
a
ranger,
Toad.
They’ll
want
you
as
far
from
the
castle
as
they
can.
If
Mance
Rayder
attacks,
lift
your
visor
and
show
your
face,
and
he’ll
run
off
screaming.”

Everyone
laughed
but
Grenn.
“I
hope
I’m
a
ranger.”

“You
and
everyone
else,”
said
Matthar.
Every
man
who
wore
the
black
walked
the
Wall,
and
every
man
was
expected
to
take
up
steel
in
its
defense,
but
the
rangers
were
the
true
fighting
heart
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
It
was
they
who
dared
ride
beyond
the
Wall,
sweeping
through
the
haunted
forest
and
the
icy
mountain
heights
west
of
the
Shadow
Tower,
fighting
wildlings
and
giants
and
monstrous
snow
bears.

“Not
everyone,”
said
Halder.
“It’s
the
builders
for
me.
What
use
would
rangers
be
if
the
Wall
fell
down?”

The
order
of
builders
provided
the
masons
and
carpenters
to
repair
keeps
and
towers,
the
miners
to
dig
tunnels
and
crush
stone
for
roads
and
footpaths,
the
woodsmen
to
clear
away
new
growth
wherever
the
forest
pressed
too
close
to
the
Wall.
Once,
it
was
said,
they
had
quarried
immense
blocks
of
ice
from
frozen
lakes
deep
in
the
haunted
forest,
dragging
them
south
on
sledges
so
the
Wall
might
be
raised
ever
higher.
Those
days
were
centuries
gone,
however;
now,
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
ride
the
Wall
from
Eastwatch
to
the
Shadow
Tower,
watching
for
cracks
or
signs
of
melt
and
making
what
repairs
they
could.

“The
Old
Bear’s
no
fool,”
Dareon
observed.
“You’re
certain
to
be
a
builder,
and
Jon’s
certain
to
be
a
ranger.
He’s
the
best
sword
and
the
best
rider
among
us,
and
his
uncle
was
the
First
before
he…”
His
voice
trailed
off
awkwardly
as
he
realized
what
he
had
almost
said.

“Benjen
Stark
is
still
First
Ranger,”
Jon
Snow
told
him,
toying
with
his
bowl
of
blueberries.
The
rest
might
have
given
up
all
hope
of
his
uncle’s
safe
return,
but
not
him.
He
pushed
away
the
berries,
scarcely
touched,
and
rose
from
the
bench.

“Aren’t
you
going
to
eat
those?”
Toad
asked.

“They’re
yours.”
Jon
had
hardly
tasted
Hobb’s
great
feast.
“I
could
not
eat
another
bite.”
He
took
his
cloak
from
its
hook
near
the
door
and
shouldered
his
way
out.

Pyp
followed
him.
“Jon,
what
is
it?”

“Sam,”
he
admitted.
“He
was
not
at
table
tonight.”

“It’s
not
like
him
to
miss
a
meal,”
Pyp
said
thoughtfully.
“Do
you
suppose
he’s
taken
ill?”

“He’s
frightened.
We’re
leaving
him.”
He
remembered
the
day
he
had
left
Winterfell,
all
the
bittersweet
farewells;
Bran
lying
broken,
Robb
with
snow
in
his
hair,
Arya
raining
kisses
on
him
after
he’d
given
her
Needle.
“Once
we
say
our
words,
we’ll
all
have
duties
to
attend
to.
Some
of
us
may
be
sent
away,
to
Eastwatch
or
the
Shadow
Tower.
Sam
will
remain
in
training,
with
the
likes
of
Rast
and
Cuger
and
these
new
boys
who
are
coming
up
the
kingsroad.
Gods
only
know
what
they’ll
be
like,
but
you
can
bet
Ser
Alliser
will
send
them
against
him,
first
chance
he
gets.”

Pyp
made
a
grimace.
“You
did
all
you
could.”

“All
we
could
wasn’t
enough,”
Jon
said.

A
deep
restlessness
was
on
him
as
he
went
back
to
Hardin’s
Tower
for
Ghost.
The
direwolf
walked
beside
him
to
the
stables.
Some
of
the
more
skittish
horses
kicked
at
their
stalls
and
laid
back
their
ears
as
they
entered.
Jon
saddled
his
mare,
mounted,
and
rode
out
from
Castle
Black,
south
across
the
moonlit
night.
Ghost
raced
ahead
of
him,
flying
over
the
ground,
gone
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
Jon
let
him
go.
A
wolf
needed
to
hunt.

He
had
no
destination
in
mind.
He
wanted
only
to
ride.
He
followed
the
creek
for
a
time,
listening
to
the
icy
trickle
of
water
over
rock,
then
cut
across
the
fields
to
the
kingsroad.
It
stretched
out
before
him,
narrow
and
stony
and
pocked
with
weeds,
a
road
of
no
particular
promise,
yet
the
sight
of
it
filled
Jon
Snow
with
a
vast
longing.
Winterfell
was
down
that
road,
and
beyond
it
Riverrun
and
King’s
Landing
and
the
Eyrie
and
so
many
other
places;
Casterly
Rock,
the
Isle
of
Faces,
the
red
mountains
of
Dorne,
the
hundred
islands
of
Braavos
in
the
sea,
the
smoking
ruins
of
old
Valyria.
All
the
places
that
Jon
would
never
see.
The
world
was
down
that
road…
and
he
was
here.

Once
he
swore
his
vow,
the
Wall
would
be
his
home
until
he
was
old
as
Maester
Aemon.
“I
have
not
sworn
yet,”
he
muttered.
He
was
no
outlaw,
bound
to
take
the
black
or
pay
the
penalty
for
his
crimes.
He
had
come
here
freely,
and
he
might
leave
freely…
until
he
said
the
words.
He
need
only
ride
on,
and
he
could
leave
it
all
behind.
By
the
time
the
moon
was
full
again,
he
would
be
back
in
Winterfell
with
his
brothers.

Your
half
brothers,
a
voice
inside
reminded
him.
And
Lady
Stark,
who
will
not
welcome
you.
There
was
no
place
for
him
in
Winterfell,
no
place
in
King’s
Landing
either.
Even
his
own
mother
had
not
had
a
place
for
him.
The
thought
of
her
made
him
sad.
He
wondered
who
she
had
been,
what
she
had
looked
like,
why
his
father
had
left
her.
Because
she
was
a
whore
or
an
adulteress,
fool.
Something
dark
and
dishonorable,
or
else
why
was
Lord
Eddard
too
ashamed
to
speak
of
her?

Jon
Snow
turned
away
from
the
kingsroad
to
look
behind
him.
The
fires
of
Castle
Black
were
hidden
behind
a
hill,
but
the
Wall
was
there,
pale
beneath
the
moon,
vast
and
cold,
running
from
horizon
to
horizon.

He
wheeled
his
horse
around
and
started
for
home.

Ghost
returned
as
he
crested
a
rise
and
saw
the
distant
glow
of
lamplight
from
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower.
The
direwolf
s
muzzle
was
red
with
blood
as
he
trotted
beside
the
horse.
Jon
found
himself
thinking
of
Samwell
Tarly
again
on
the
ride
back.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
stables,
he
knew
what
he
must
do.

Maester
Aemon’s
apartments
were
in
a
stout
wooden
keep
below
the
rookery.
Aged
and
frail,
the
maester
shared
his
chambers
with
two
of
the
younger
stewards,
who
tended
to
his
needs
and
helped
him
in
his
duties.
The
brothers
joked
that
he
had
been
given
the
two
ugliest
men
in
the
Night’s
Watch;
being
blind,
he
was
spared
having
to
look
at
them.
Clydas
was
short,
bald,
and
chinless,
with
small
pink
eyes
like
a
mole.
Chett
had
a
wen
on
his
neck
the
size
of
a
pigeon’s
egg,
and
a
face
red
with
boils
and
pimples.
Perhaps
that
was
why
he
always
seemed
so
angry.

It
was
Chett
who
answered
Jon’s
knock.
“I
need
to
speak
to
Maester
Aemon,”
Jon
told
him.

“The
maester
is
abed,
as
you
should
be.
Come
back
on
the
morrow
and
maybe
he’ll
see
you.”
He
began
to
shut
the
door.

Jon
jammed
it
open
with
his
boot.
“I
need
to
speak
to
him
now.
The
morning
will
be
too
late.”

Chett
scowled.
“The
maester
is
not
accustomed
to
being
woken
in
the
night.
Do
you
know
how
old
he
is?”

“Old
enough
to
treat
visitors
with
more
courtesy
than
you,”
Jon
said.
“Give
him
my
pardons.
I
would
not
disturb
his
rest
if
it
were
not
important.”

“And
if
I
refuse?”

Jon
had
his
boot
wedged
solidly
in
the
door.
“I
can
stand
here
all
night
if
I
must.”

The
black
brother
made
a
disgusted
noise
and
opened
the
door
to
admit
him.
“Wait
in
the
library.
There’s
wood.
Start
a
fire.
I
won’t
have
the
maester
catching
a
chill
on
account
of
you.”

Jon
had
the
logs
crackling
merrily
by
the
time
Chett
led
in
Maester
Aemon.
The
old
man
was
clad
in
his
bed
robe,
but
around
his
throat
was
the
chain
collar
of
his
order.
A
maester
did
not
remove
it
even
to
sleep.
“The
chair
beside
the
fire
would
be
pleasant,”
he
said
when
he
felt
the
warmth
on
his
face.
When
he
was
settled
comfortably,
Chett
covered
his
legs
with
a
fur
and
went
to
stand
by
the
door.

“I
am
sorry
to
have
woken
you,
Maester,”
Jon
Snow
said.

“You
did
not
wake
me,”
Maester
Aemon
replied.
“I
find
I
need
less
sleep
as
I
grow
older,
and
I
am
grown
very
old.
I
often
spend
half
the
night
with
ghosts,
remembering
times
fifty
years
past
as
if
they
were
yesterday.
The
mystery
of
a
midnight
visitor
is
a
welcome
diversion.
So
tell
me,
Jon
Snow,
why
have
you
come
calling
at
this
strange
hour?”

“To
ask
that
Samwell
Tarly
be
taken
from
training
and
accepted
as
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”

“This
is
no
concern
of
Maester
Aemon,”
Chett
complained.

“Our
Lord
Commander
has
given
the
training
of
recruits
into
the
hands
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne,”
the
maester
said
gently.
“Only
he
may
say
when
a
boy
is
ready
to
swear
his
vow,
as
you
surely
know.
Why
then
come
to
me?”

“The
Lord
Commander
listens
to
you,”
Jon
told
him.
“And
the
wounded
and
the
sick
of
the
Night’s
Watch
are
in
your
charge.”

“And
is
your
friend
Samwell
wounded
or
sick?”

“He
will
be,”
Jon
promised,
“unless
you
help.”

He
told
them
all
of
it,
even
the
part
where
he’d
set
Ghost
at
Rast’s
throat.
Maester
Aemon
listened
silently,
blind
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire,
but
Chett’s
face
darkened
with
each
word.
“Without
us
to
keep
him
safe,
Sam
will
have
no
chance,”
Jon
finished.
“He’s
hopeless
with
a
sword.
My
sister
Arya
could
tear
him
apart,
and
she’s
not
yet
ten.
If
Ser
Alliser
makes
him
fight,
it’s
only
a
matter
of
time
before
he’s
hurt
or
killed.”

Chett
could
stand
no
more.
“I’ve
seen
this
fat
boy
in
the
common
hall,”
he
said.
“He
is
a
pig,
and
a
hopeless
craven
as
well,
if
what
you
say
is
true.”

“Maybe
it
is
so,”
Maester
Aemon
said.
“Tell
me,
Chett,
what
would
you
have
us
do
with
such
a
boy?”

“Leave
him
where
he
is,”
Chett
said.
“The
Wall
is
no
place
for
the
weak.
Let
him
train
until
he
is
ready,
no
matter
how
many
years
that
takes.
Ser
Alliser
shall
make
a
man
of
him
or
kill
him,
as
the
gods
will.”

“That’s
stupid,”
Jon
said.
He
took
a
deep
breath
to
gather
his
thoughts.
“I
remember
once
I
asked
Maester
Luwin
why
he
wore
a
chain
around
his
throat.”

Maester
Aemon
touched
his
own
collar
lightly,
his
bony,
wrinkled
finger
stroking
the
heavy
metal
links.
“Go
on.”

“He
told
me
that
a
maester’s
collar
is
made
of
chain
to
remind
him
that
he
is
sworn
to
serve,”
Jon
said,
remembering.
“I
asked
why
each
link
was
a
different
metal.
A
silver
chain
would
look
much
finer
with
his
grey
robes,
I
said.
Maester
Luwin
laughed.
A
maester
forges
his
chain
with
study,
he
told
me.
The
different
metals
are
each
a
different
kind
of
learning,
gold
for
the
study
of
money
and
accounts,
silver
for
healing,
iron
for
warcraft.
And
he
said
there
were
other
meanings
as
well.
The
collar
is
supposed
to
remind
a
maester
of
the
realm
he
serves,
isn’t
that
so?
Lords
are
gold
and
knights
steel,
but
two
links
can’t
make
a
chain.
You
also
need
silver
and
iron
and
lead,
tin
and
copper
and
bronze
and
all
the
rest,
and
those
are
farmers
and
smiths
and
merchants
and
the
like.
A
chain
needs
all
sorts
of
metals,
and
a
land
needs
all
sorts
of
people.”

Maester
Aemon
smiled.
“And
so?”

“The
Night’s
Watch
needs
all
sorts
too.
Why
else
have
rangers
and
stewards
and
builders?
Lord
Randyll
couldn’t
make
Sam
a
warrior,
and
Ser
Alliser
won’t
either.
You
can’t
hammer
tin
into
iron,
no
matter
how
hard
you
beat
it,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
tin
is
useless.
Why
shouldn’t
Sam
be
a
steward?”

Chett
gave
an
angry
scowl.
“I’m
a
steward.
You
think
it’s
easy
work,
fit
for
cowards?
The
order
of
stewards
keeps
the
Watch
alive.
We
hunt
and
farm,
tend
the
horses,
milk
the
cows,
gather
firewood,
cook
the
meals.
Who
do
you
think
makes
your
clothing?
Who
brings
up
supplies
from
the
south?
The
stewards.”

Maester
Aemon
was
gentler.
“Is
your
friend
a
hunter?”

“He
hates
hunting,”
Jon
had
to
admit.

“Can
he
plow
a
field?”
the
maester
asked.
“Can
he
drive
a
wagon
or
sail
a
ship?
Could
he
butcher
a
cow?”

“No.”

Chett
gave
a
nasty
laugh.
“I’ve
seen
what
happens
to
soft
lordlings
when
they’re
put
to
work.
Set
them
to
churning
butter
and
their
hands
blister
and
bleed.
Give
them
an
axe
to
split
logs,
and
they
cut
off
their
own
foot.”

“I
know
one
thing
Sam
could
do
better
than
anyone.”

“Yes?”
Maester
Aemon
prompted.

Jon
glanced
warily
at
Chett,
standing
beside
the
door,
his
boils
red
and
angry.
“He
could
help
you,”
he
said
quickly.
“He
can
do
sums,
and
he
knows
how
to
read
and
write.
I
know
Chett
can’t
read,
and
Clydas
has
weak
eyes.
Sam
read
every
book
in
his
father’s
library.
He’d
be
good
with
the
ravens
too.
Animals
seem
to
like
him.
Ghost
took
to
him
straight
off.
There’s
a
lot
he
could
do,
besides
fighting.
The
Night’s
Watch
needs
every
man.
Why
kill
one,
to
no
end?
Make
use
of
him
instead.”

Maester
Aemon
closed
his
eyes,
and
for
a
brief
moment
Jon
was
afraid
that
he
had
gone
to
sleep.
Finally
he
said,
“Maester
Luwin
taught
you
well,
Jon
Snow.
Your
mind
is
as
deft
as
your
blade,
it
would
seem.”

“Does
that
mean…”

“It
means
I
shall
think
on
what
you
have
said,”
the
maester
told
him
firmly.
“And
now,
I
believe
I
am
ready
to
sleep.
Chett,
show
our
young
brother
to
the
door.”





TYRION

They
had
taken
shelter
beneath
a
copse
of
aspens
just
off
the
high
road.
Tyrion
was
gathering
deadwood
while
their
horses
took
water
from
a
mountain
stream.
He
stooped
to
pick
up
a
splintered
branch
and
examined
it
critically.
“Will
this
do?
I
am
not
practiced
at
starting
fires.
Morrec
did
that
for
me.”

“A
fire?”
Bronn
said,
spitting.
“Are
you
so
hungry
to
die,
dwarf?
Or
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses?
A
fire
will
bring
the
clansmen
down
on
us
from
miles
around.
I
mean
to
survive
this
journey,
Lannister.”

“And
how
do
you
hope
to
do
that?”
Tyrion
asked.
He
tucked
the
branch
under
his
arm
and
poked
around
through
the
sparse
undergrowth,
looking
for
more.
His
back
ached
from
the
effort
of
bending;
they
had
been
riding
since
daybreak,
when
a
stone-faced
Ser
Lyn
Corbray
had
ushered
them
through
the
Bloody
Gate
and
commanded
them
never
to
return.

“We
have
no
chance
of
fighting
our
way
back,”
Bronn
said,
“but
two
can
cover
more
ground
than
ten,
and
attract
less
notice.
The
fewer
days
we
spend
in
these
mountains,
the
more
like
we
are
to
reach
the
riverlands.
Ride
hard
and
fast,
I
say.
Travel
by
night
and
hole
up
by
day,
avoid
the
road
where
we
can,
make
no
noise
and
light
no
fires.”

Tyrion
Lannister
sighed.
“A
splendid
plan,
Bronn.
Try
it,
as
you
like…
and
forgive
me
if
I
do
not
linger
to
bury
you.”

“You
think
to
outlive
me,
dwarf?”
The
sellsword
grinned.
He
had
a
dark
gap
in
his
smile
where
the
edge
of
Ser
Vardis
Egen’s
shield
had
cracked
a
tooth
in
half.

Tyrion
shrugged.
“Riding
hard
and
fast
by
night
is
a
sure
way
to
tumble
down
a
mountain
and
crack
your
skull.
I
prefer
to
make
my
crossing
slow
and
easy.
I
know
you
love
the
taste
of
horse,
Bronn,
but
if
our
mounts
die
under
us
this
time,
we’ll
be
trying
to
saddle
shadowcats…
and
if
truth
be
told,
I
think
the
clans
will
find
us
no
matter
what
we
do.
Their
eyes
are
all
around
us.”
He
swept
a
gloved
hand
over
the
high,
wind-carved
crags
that
surrounded
them.

Bronn
grimaced.
“Then
we’re
dead
men,
Lannister.”

“If
so,
I
prefer
to
die
comfortable,”
Tyrion
replied.
“We
need
a
fire.
The
nights
are
cold
up
here,
and
hot
food
will
warm
our
bellies
and
lift
our
spirits.
Do
you
suppose
there’s
any
game
to
be
had?
Lady
Lysa
has
kindly
provided
us
with
a
veritable
feast
of
salt
beef,
hard
cheese,
and
stale
bread,
but
I
would
hate
to
break
a
tooth
so
far
from
the
nearest
maester.”

“I
can
find
meat.”
Beneath
a
fall
of
black
hair,
Bronn’s
dark
eyes
regarded
Tyrion
suspiciously.
“I
should
leave
you
here
with
your
fool’s
fire.
If
I
took
your
horse,
I’d
have
twice
the
chance
to
make
it
through.
What
would
you
do
then,
dwarf?”

“Die,
most
like.”
Tyrion
stooped
to
get
another
stick.

“You
don’t
think
I’d
do
it?”

“You’d
do
it
in
an
instant,
if
it
meant
your
life.
You
were
quick
enough
to
silence
your
friend
Chiggen
when
he
caught
that
arrow
in
his
belly.”
Bronn
had
yanked
back
the
man’s
head
by
the
hair
and
driven
the
point
of
his
dirk
in
under
the
ear,
and
afterward
told
Catelyn
Stark
that
the
other
sellsword
had
died
of
his
wound.

“He
was
good
as
dead,”
Bronn
said,
“and
his
moaning
was
bringing
them
down
on
us.
Chiggen
would
have
done
the
same
for
me…
and
he
was
no
friend,
only
a
man
I
rode
with.
Make
no
mistake,
dwarf.
I
fought
for
you,
but
I
do
not
love
you.”

“It
was
your
blade
I
needed,”
Tyrion
said,
“not
your
love.”
He
dumped
his
armful
of
wood
on
the
ground.

Bronn
grinned.
“You’re
bold
as
any
sellsword,
I’ll
give
you
that.
How
did
you
know
I’d
take
your
part?”

“Know?”
Tyrion
squatted
awkwardly
on
his
stunted
legs
to
build
the
fire.
“I
tossed
the
dice.
Back
at
the
inn,
you
and
Chiggen
helped
take
me
captive.
Why?
The
others
saw
it
as
their
duty,
for
the
honor
of
the
lords
they
served,
but
not
you
two.
You
had
no
lord,
no
duty,
and
precious
little
honor,
so
why
trouble
to
involve
yourselves?”
He
took
out
his
knife
and
whittled
some
thin
strips
of
bark
off
one
of
the
sticks
he’d
gathered,
to
serve
as
kindling.
“Well,
why
do
sellswords
do
anything?
For
gold.
You
were
thinking
Lady
Catelyn
would
reward
you
for
your
help,
perhaps
even
take
you
into
her
service.
Here,
that
should
do,
I
hope.
Do
you
have
a
flint?”

Bronn
slid
two
fingers
into
the
pouch
at
his
belt
and
tossed
down
a
flint.
Tyrion
caught
it
in
the
air.

“My
thanks,”
he
said.
“The
thing
is,
you
did
not
know
the
Starks.
Lord
Eddard
is
a
proud,
honorable,
and
honest
man,
and
his
lady
wife
is
worse.
Oh,
no
doubt
she
would
have
found
a
coin
or
two
for
you
when
this
was
all
over,
and
pressed
it
in
your
hand
with
a
polite
word
and
a
look
of
distaste,
but
that’s
the
most
you
could
have
hoped
for.
The
Starks
look
for
courage
and
loyalty
and
honor
in
the
men
they
choose
to
serve
them,
and
if
truth
be
told,
you
and
Chiggen
were
lowborn
scum.”
Tyrion
struck
the
flint
against
his
dagger,
trying
for
a
spark.
Nothing.

Bronn
snorted.
“You
have
a
bold
tongue,
little
man.
One
day
someone
is
like
to
cut
it
out
and
make
you
eat
it.”

“Everyone
tells
me
that.”
Tyrion
glanced
up
at
the
sellsword.
“Did
I
offend
you?
My
pardons…
but
you
are
scum,
Bronn,
make
no
mistake.
Duty,
honor,
friendship,
what’s
that
to
you?
No,
don’t
trouble
yourself,
we
both
know
the
answer.
Still,
you’re
not
stupid.
Once
we
reached
the
Vale,
Lady
Stark
had
no
more
need
of
you…
but
I
did,
and
the
one
thing
the
Lannisters
have
never
lacked
for
is
gold.
When
the
moment
came
to
toss
the
dice,
I
was
counting
on
your
being
smart
enough
to
know
where
your
best
interest
lay.
Happily
for
me,
you
did.”
He
slammed
stone
and
steel
together
again,
fruitlessly.

“Here,”
said
Bronn,
squatting,
“I’ll
do
it.”
He
took
the
knife
and
flint
from
Tyrion’s
hands
and
struck
sparks
on
his
first
try.
A
curl
of
bark
began
to
smolder.

“Well
done,”
Tyrion
said.
“Scum
you
may
be,
but
you’re
undeniably
useful,
and
with
a
sword
in
your
hand
you’re
almost
as
good
as
my
brother
Jaime.
What
do
you
want,
Bronn?
Gold?
Land?
Women?
Keep
me
alive,
and
you’ll
have
it.”

Bronn
blew
gently
on
the
fire,
and
the
flames
leapt
up
higher.
“And
if
you
die?”

“Why
then,
I’ll
have
one
mourner
whose
grief
is
sincere,”
Tyrion
said,
grinning.
“The
gold
ends
when
I
do.”

The
fire
was
blazing
up
nicely.
Bronn
stood,
tucked
the
flint
back
into
his
pouch,
and
tossed
Tyrion
his
dagger.
“Fair
enough,”
he
said.
“My
sword’s
yours,
then…
but
don’t
go
looking
for
me
to
bend
the
knee
and
m’lord
you
every
time
you
take
a
shit.
I’m
no
man’s
toady.”

“Nor
any
man’s
friend,”
Tyrion
said.
“I’ve
no
doubt
you’d
betray
me
as
quick
as
you
did
Lady
Stark,
if
you
saw
a
profit
in
it.
If
the
day
ever
comes
when
you’re
tempted
to
sell
me
out,
remember
this,
Bronn—I’ll
match
their
price,
whatever
it
is.
I
like
living.
And
now,
do
you
think
you
could
do
something
about
finding
us
some
supper?”

“Take
care
of
the
horses,”
Bronn
said,
unsheathing
the
long
dirk
he
wore
at
his
hip.
He
strode
into
the
trees.

An
hour
later
the
horses
had
been
rubbed
down
and
fed,
the
fire
was
crackling
away
merrily,
and
a
haunch
of
a
young
goat
was
turning
above
the
flames,
spitting
and
hissing.
“All
we
lack
now
is
some
good
wine
to
wash
down
our
kid,”
Tyrion
said.

“That,
a
woman,
and
another
dozen
swords,”
Bronn
said.
He
sat
cross-legged
beside
the
fire,
honing
the
edge
of
his
longsword
with
an
oilstone.
There
was
something
strangely
reassuring
about
the
rasping
sound
it
made
when
he
drew
it
down
the
steel.
“It
will
be
full
dark
soon,”
the
sellsword
pointed
out.
“I’ll
take
first
watch…
for
all
the
good
it
will
do
us.
It
might
be
kinder
to
let
them
kill
us
in
our
sleep.”

“Oh,
I
imagine
they’ll
be
here
long
before
it
comes
to
sleep.”
The
smell
of
the
roasting
meat
made
Tyrion’s
mouth
water.

Bronn
watched
him
across
the
fire.
“You
have
a
plan,”
he
said
flatly,
with
a
scrape
of
steel
on
stone.

“A
hope,
call
it,”
Tyrion
said.
“Another
toss
of
the
dice.”

“With
our
lives
as
the
stake?”

Tyrion
shrugged.
“What
choice
do
we
have?”
He
leaned
over
the
fire
and
sawed
a
thin
slice
of
meat
from
the
kid.
“Ahhhh,”
he
sighed
happily
as
he
chewed.
Grease
ran
down
his
chin.
“A
bit
tougher
than
I’d
like,
and
in
want
of
spicing,
but
I’ll
not
complain
too
loudly.
If
I
were
back
at
the
Eyrie,
I’d
be
dancing
on
a
precipice
in
hopes
of
a
boiled
bean.”

“And
yet
you
gave
the
turnkey
a
purse
of
gold,”
Bronn
said.

“A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts.”

Even
Mord
had
scarcely
believed
it
when
Tyrion
tossed
him
the
leather
purse.
The
gaoler’s
eyes
had
gone
big
as
boiled
eggs
as
he
yanked
open
the
drawstring
and
beheld
the
glint
of
gold.
“I
kept
the
silver,”
Tyrion
had
told
him
with
a
crooked
smile,
“but
you
were
promised
the
gold,
and
there
it
is.”
It
was
more
than
a
man
like
Mord
could
hope
to
earn
in
a
lifetime
of
abusing
prisoners.
“And
remember
what
I
said,
this
is
only
a
taste.
If
you
ever
grow
tired
of
Lady
Arryn’s
service,
present
yourself
at
Casterly
Rock,
and
I’ll
pay
you
the
rest
of
what
I
owe
you.”
With
golden
dragons
spilling
out
of
both
hands,
Mord
had
fallen
to
his
knees
and
promised
that
he
would
do
just
that.

Bronn
yanked
out
his
dirk
and
pulled
the
meat
from
the
fire.
He
began
to
carve
thick
chunks
of
charred
meat
off
the
bone
as
Tyrion
hollowed
out
two
heels
of
stale
bread
to
serve
as
trenchers.
“If
we
do
reach
the
river,
what
will
you
do
then?”
the
sellsword
asked
as
he
cut.

“Oh,
a
whore
and
a
featherbed
and
a
flagon
of
wine,
for
a
start.”
Tyrion
held
out
his
trencher,
and
Bronn
filled
it
with
meat.
“And
then
to
Casterly
Rock
or
King’s
Landing,
I
think.
I
have
some
questions
that
want
answering,
concerning
a
certain
dagger.”

The
sellsword
chewed
and
swallowed.
“So
you
were
telling
it
true?
It
was
not
your
knife?”

Tyrion
smiled
thinly.
“Do
I
look
a
liar
to
you?”

By
the
time
their
bellies
were
full,
the
stars
had
come
out
and
a
halfmoon
was
rising
over
the
mountains.
Tyrion
spread
his
shadowskin
cloak
on
the
ground
and
stretched
out
with
his
saddle
for
a
pillow.
“Our
friends
are
taking
their
sweet
time.”

“If
I
were
them,
I’d
fear
a
trap,”
Bronn
said.
“Why
else
would
we
be
so
open,
if
not
to
lure
them
in?”

Tyrion
chuckled.
“Then
we
ought
to
sing
and
send
them
fleeing
in
terror.”
He
began
to
whistle
a
tune.

“You’re
mad,
dwarf,”
Bronn
said
as
he
cleaned
the
grease
out
from
under
his
nails
with
his
dirk.

“Where’s
your
love
of
music,
Bronn?”

“If
it
was
music
you
wanted,
you
should
have
gotten
the
singer
to
champion
you.”

Tyrion
grinned.
“That
would
have
been
amusing.
I
can
just
see
him
fending
off
Ser
Vardis
with
his
woodharp.”
He
resumed
his
whistling.
“Do
you
know
this
song?”
he
asked.

“You
hear
it
here
and
there,
in
inns
and
whorehouses.”

“Myrish.
‘The
Seasons
of
My
Love.’
Sweet
and
sad,
if
you
understand
the
words.
The
first
girl
I
ever
bedded
used
to
sing
it,
and
I’ve
never
been
able
to
put
it
out
of
my
head.”
Tyrion
gazed
up
at
the
sky.
It
was
a
clear
cold
night
and
the
stars
shone
down
upon
the
mountains
as
bright
and
merciless
as
truth.
“I
met
her
on
a
night
like
this,”
he
heard
himself
saying.
“Jaime
and
I
were
riding
back
from
Lannisport
when
we
heard
a
scream,
and
she
came
running
out
into
the
road
with
two
men
dogging
her
heels,
shouting
threats.
My
brother
unsheathed
his
sword
and
went
after
them,
while
I
dismounted
to
protect
the
girl.
She
was
scarcely
a
year
older
than
I
was,
dark-haired,
slender,
with
a
face
that
would
break
your
heart.
It
certainly
broke
mine.
Lowborn,
half-starved,
unwashed…
yet
lovely.
They’d
torn
the
rags
she
was
wearing
half
off
her
back,
so
I
wrapped
her
in
my
cloak
while
Jaime
chased
the
men
into
the
woods.
By
the
time
he
came
trotting
back,
I’d
gotten
a
name
out
of
her,
and
a
story.
She
was
a
crofter’s
child,
orphaned
when
her
father
died
of
fever,
on
her
way
to…
well,
nowhere,
really.

“Jaime
was
all
in
a
lather
to
hunt
down
the
men.
It
was
not
often
outlaws
dared
prey
on
travelers
so
near
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
he
took
it
as
an
insult.
The
girl
was
too
frightened
to
send
off
by
herself,
though,
so
I
offered
to
take
her
to
the
closest
inn
and
feed
her
while
my
brother
rode
back
to
the
Rock
for
help.

“She
was
hungrier
than
I
would
have
believed.
We
finished
two
whole
chickens
and
part
of
a
third,
and
drank
a
flagon
of
wine,
talking.
I
was
only
thirteen,
and
the
wine
went
to
my
head,
I
fear.
The
next
thing
I
knew,
I
was
sharing
her
bed.
If
she
was
shy,
I
was
shyer.
I’ll
never
know
where
I
found
the
courage.
When
I
broke
her
maidenhead,
she
wept,
but
afterward
she
kissed
me
and
sang
her
little
song,
and
by
morning
I
was
in
love.”

“You?”
Bronn’s
voice
was
amused.

“Absurd,
isn’t
it?”
Tyrion
began
to
whistle
the
song
again.
“I
married
her,”
he
finally
admitted.

“A
Lannister
of
Casterly
Rock
wed
to
a
crofter’s
daughter,”
Bronn
said.
“How
did
you
manage
that?”

“Oh,
you’d
be
astonished
at
what
a
boy
can
make
of
a
few
lies,
fifty
pieces
of
silver,
and
a
drunken
septon.
I
dared
not
bring
my
bride
home
to
Casterly
Rock,
so
I
set
her
up
in
a
cottage
of
her
own,
and
for
a
fortnight
we
played
at
being
man
and
wife.
And
then
the
septon
sobered
and
confessed
all
to
my
lord
father.”
Tyrion
was
surprised
at
how
desolate
it
made
him
feel
to
say
it,
even
after
all
these
years.
Perhaps
he
was
just
tired.
“That
was
the
end
of
my
marriage.”
He
sat
up
and
stared
at
the
dying
fire,
blinking
at
the
light.

“He
sent
the
girl
away?”

“He
did
better
than
that,”
Tyrion
said.
“First
he
made
my
brother
tell
me
the
truth.
The
girl
was
a
whore,
you
see.
Jaime
arranged
the
whole
affair,
the
road,
the
outlaws,
all
of
it.
He
thought
it
was
time
I
had
a
woman.
He
paid
double
for
a
maiden,
knowing
it
would
be
my
first
time.

“After
Jaime
had
made
his
confession,
to
drive
home
the
lesson,
Lord
Tywin
brought
my
wife
in
and
gave
her
to
his
guards.
They
paid
her
fair
enough.
A
silver
for
each
man,
how
many
whores
command
that
high
a
price?
He
sat
me
down
in
the
corner
of
the
barracks
and
bade
me
watch,
and
at
the
end
she
had
so
many
silvers
the
coins
were
slipping
through
her
fingers
and
rolling
on
the
floor,
she…”
The
smoke
was
stinging
his
eyes.
Tyrion
cleared
his
throat
and
turned
away
from
the
fire,
to
gaze
out
into
darkness.
“Lord
Tywin
had
me
go
last,”
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice.
“And
he
gave
me
a
gold
coin
to
pay
her,
because
I
was
a
Lannister,
and
worth
more.”

After
a
time
he
heard
the
noise
again,
the
rasp
of
steel
on
stone
as
Bronn
sharpened
his
sword.
“Thirteen
or
thirty
or
three,
I
would
have
killed
the
man
who
did
that
to
me.”

Tyrion
swung
around
to
face
him.
“You
may
get
that
chance
one
day.
Remember
what
I
told
you.
A
Lannister
always
pays
his
debts.”
He
yawned.
“I
think
I
will
try
and
sleep.
Wake
me
if
we’re
about
to
die.”

He
rolled
himself
up
in
the
shadowskin
and
shut
his
eyes.
The
ground
was
stony
and
cold,
but
after
a
time
Tyrion
Lannister
did
sleep.
He
dreamt
of
the
sky
cell.
This
time
he
was
the
gaoler,
not
the
prisoner,
big,
with
a
strap
in
his
hand,
and
he
was
hitting
his
father,
driving
him
back,
toward
the
abyss…

“Tyrion.”
Bronn’s
warning
was
low
and
urgent.

Tyrion
was
awake
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
The
fire
had
burned
down
to
embers,
and
the
shadows
were
creeping
in
all
around
them.
Bronn
had
raised
himself
to
one
knee,
his
sword
in
one
hand
and
his
dirk
in
the
other.
Tyrion
held
up
a
hand:
stay
still,
it
said.
“Come
share
our
fire,
the
night
is
cold,”
he
called
out
to
the
creeping
shadows.
“I
fear
we’ve
no
wine
to
offer
you,
but
you’re
welcome
to
some
of
our
goat.”

All
movement
stopped.
Tyrion
saw
the
glint
of
moonlight
on
metal.
“Our
mountain,”
a
voice
called
out
from
the
trees,
deep
and
hard
and
unfriendly.
“Our
goat.”

“Your
goat,”
Tyrion
agreed.
“Who
are
you?”

“When
you
meet
your
gods,”
a
different
voice
replied,
“say
it
was
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn
of
the
Stone
Crows
who
sent
you
to
them.”
A
branch
cracked
underfoot
as
he
stepped
into
the
light;
a
thin
man
in
a
horned
helmet,
armed
with
a
long
knife.

“And
Shagga
son
of
Dolf.”
That
was
the
first
voice,
deep
and
deadly.
A
boulder
shifted
to
their
left,
and
stood,
and
became
a
man.
Massive
and
slow
and
strong
he
seemed,
dressed
all
in
skins,
with
a
club
in
his
right
hand
and
an
axe
in
his
left.
He
smashed
them
together
as
he
lumbered
closer.

Other
voices
called
other
names,
Conn
and
Torrek
and
Jaggot
and
more
that
Tyrion
forgot
the
instant
he
heard
them;
ten
at
least.
A
few
had
swords
and
knives;
others
brandished
pitchforks
and
scythes
and
wooden
spears.
He
waited
until
they
were
done
shouting
out
their
names
before
he
gave
them
answer.
“I
am
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin,
of
the
Clan
Lannister,
the
Lions
of
the
Rock.
We
will
gladly
pay
you
for
the
goat
we
ate.”

“What
do
you
have
to
give
us,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?”
asked
the
one
who
named
himself
Gunthor,
who
seemed
to
be
their
chief.

“There
is
silver
in
my
purse,”
Tyrion
told
them.
“This
hauberk
I
wear
is
large
for
me,
but
it
should
fit
Conn
nicely,
and
the
battle-axe
I
carry
would
suit
Shagga’s
mighty
hand
far
better
than
that
wood-axe
he
holds.”

“The
halfman
would
pay
us
with
our
own
coin,”
said
Conn.

“Conn
speaks
truly,”
Gunthor
said.
“Your
silver
is
ours.
Your
horses
are
ours.
Your
hauberk
and
your
battle-axe
and
the
knife
at
your
belt,
those
are
ours
too.
You
have
nothing
to
give
us
but
your
lives.
How
would
you
like
to
die,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?”

“In
my
own
bed,
with
a
belly
full
of
wine
and
a
maiden’s
mouth
around
my
cock,
at
the
age
of
eighty,”
he
replied.

The
huge
one,
Shagga,
laughed
first
and
loudest.
The
others
seemed
less
amused.
“Conn,
take
their
horses,”
Gunthor
commanded.
“Kill
the
other
and
seize
the
halfinan.
He
can
milk
the
goats
and
make
the
mothers
laugh.”

Bronn
sprang
to
his
feet.
“Who
dies
first?”

“No!”
Tyrion
said
sharply.
“Gunthor
son
of
Gurn,
hear
me.
My
House
is
rich
and
powerful.
If
the
Stone
Crows
will
see
us
safely
through
these
mountains,
my
lord
father
will
shower
you
with
gold.”

“The
gold
of
a
lowland
lord
is
as
worthless
as
a
halfman’s
promises,”
Gunthor
said.

“Half
a
man
I
may
be,”
Tyrion
said,
“yet
I
have
the
courage
to
face
my
enemies.
What
do
the
Stone
Crows
do,
but
hide
behind
rocks
and
shiver
with
fear
as
the
knights
of
the
Vale
ride
by?”

Shagga
gave
a
roar
of
anger
and
clashed
club
against
axe.
Jaggot
poked
at
Tyrion’s
face
with
the
fire-hardened
point
of
a
long
wooden
spear.
He
did
his
best
not
to
flinch.
“Are
these
the
best
weapons
you
could
steal?”
he
said.
“Good
enough
for
killing
sheep,
perhaps…
if
the
sheep
do
not
fight
back.
My
father’s
smiths
shit
better
steel.”

“Little
boyman,”
Shagga
roared,
“will
you
mock
my
axe
after
I
chop
off
your
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats?”

But
Gunthor
raised
a
hand.
“No.
I
would
hear
his
words.
The
mothers
go
hungry,
and
steel
fills
more
mouths
than
gold.
What
would
you
give
us
for
your
lives,
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin?
Swords?
Lances?
Mail?”

“All
that,
and
more,
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn,”
Tyrion
Lannister
replied,
smiling.
“I
will
give
you
the
Vale
of
Arryn.”





EDDARD

Through
the
high
narrow
windows
of
the
Red
Keep’s
cavernous
throne
room,
the
light
of
sunset
spilled
across
the
floor,
laying
dark
red
stripes
upon
the
walls
where
the
heads
of
dragons
had
once
hung.
Now
the
stone
was
covered
with
hunting
tapestries,
vivid
with
greens
and
browns
and
blues,
and
yet
still
it
seemed
to
Ned
Stark
that
the
only
color
in
the
hall
was
the
red
of
blood.

He
sat
high
upon
the
immense
ancient
seat
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror,
an
ironwork
monstrosity
of
spikes
and
jagged
edges
and
grotesquely
twisted
metal.
It
was,
as
Robert
had
warned
him,
a
hellishly
uncomfortable
chair,
and
never
more
so
than
now,
with
his
shattered
leg
throbbing
more
sharply
every
minute.
The
metal
beneath
him
had
grown
harder
by
the
hour,
and
the
fanged
steel
behind
made
it
impossible
to
lean
back.
A
king
should
never
sit
easy,
Aegon
the
Conqueror
had
said,
when
he
commanded
his
armorers
to
forge
a
great
seat
from
the
swords
laid
down
by
his
enemies.
Damn
Aegon
for
his
arrogance,
Ned
thought
sullenly,
and
damn
Robert
and
his
hunting
as
well.

“You
are
quite
certain
these
were
more
than
brigands?”
Varys
asked
softly
from
the
council
table
beneath
the
throne.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stirred
uneasily
beside
him,
while
Littlefinger
toyed
with
a
pen.
They
were
the
only
councillors
in
attendance.
A
white
hart
had
been
sighted
in
the
kingswood,
and
Lord
Renly
and
Ser
Barristan
had
joined
the
king
to
hunt
it,
along
with
Prince
Joffrey,
Sandor
Clegane,
Balon
Swann,
and
half
the
court.
So
Ned
must
needs
sit
the
Iron
Throne
in
his
absence.

At
least
he
could
sit.
Save
the
council,
the
rest
must
stand
respectfully,
or
kneel.
The
petitioners
clustered
near
the
tall
doors,
the
knights
and
high
lords
and
ladies
beneath
the
tapestries,
the
smallfolk
in
the
gallery,
the
mailed
guards
in
their
cloaks,
gold
or
grey:
all
stood.

The
villagers
were
kneeling:
men,
women,
and
children,
alike
tattered
and
bloody,
their
faces
drawn
by
fear.
The
three
knights
who
had
brought
them
here
to
bear
witness
stood
behind
them.

“Brigands,
Lord
Varys?”
Ser
Raymun
Darry’s
voice
dripped
scorn.
“Oh,
they
were
brigands,
beyond
a
doubt.
Lannister
brigands.”

Ned
could
feel
the
unease
in
the
hall,
as
high
lords
and
servants
alike
strained
to
listen.
He
could
not
pretend
to
surprise.
The
west
had
been
a
tinderbox
since
Catelyn
had
seized
Tyrion
Lannister.
Both
Riverrun
and
Casterly
Rock
had
called
their
banners,
and
armies
were
massing
in
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth.
It
had
only
been
a
matter
of
time
until
the
blood
began
to
flow.
The
sole
question
that
remained
was
how
best
to
stanch
the
wound.

Sad-eyed
Ser
Karyl
Vance,
who
would
have
been
handsome
but
for
the
winestain
birthmark
that
discolored
his
face,
gestured
at
the
kneeling
villagers.
“This
is
all
the
remains
of
the
holdfast
of
Sherrer,
Lord
Eddard.
The
rest
are
dead,
along
with
the
people
of
Wendish
Town
and
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

“Rise,”
Ned
commanded
the
villagers.
He
never
trusted
what
a
man
told
him
from
his
knees.
“All
of
you,
up.”

In
ones
and
twos,
the
holdfast
of
Sherrer
struggled
to
its
feet.
One
ancient
needed
to
be
helped,
and
a
young
girl
in
a
bloody
dress
stayed
on
her
knees,
staring
blankly
at
Ser
Arys
Oakheart,
who
stood
by
the
foot
of
the
throne
in
the
white
armor
of
the
Kingsguard,
ready
to
protect
and
defend
the
king…
or,
Ned
supposed,
the
King’s
Hand.

“Joss,”
Ser
Raymun
Darry
said
to
a
plump
balding
man
in
a
brewer’s
apron.
“Tell
the
Hand
what
happened
at
Sherrer.”

Joss
nodded.
“If
it
please
His
Grace—”

“His
Grace
is
hunting
across
the
Blackwater,”
Ned
said,
wondering
how
a
man
could
live
his
whole
life
a
few
days
ride
from
the
Red
Keep
and
still
have
no
notion
what
his
king
looked
like.
Ned
was
clad
in
a
white
linen
doublet
with
the
direwolf
of
Stark
on
the
breast;
his
black
wool
cloak
was
fastened
at
the
collar
by
his
silver
hand
of
office.
Black
and
white
and
grey,
all
the
shades
of
truth.
“I
am
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
the
King’s
Hand.
Tell
me
who
you
are
and
what
you
know
of
these
raiders.”

“I
keep…
I
kept…
I
kept
an
alehouse,
m’lord,
in
Sherrer,
by
the
stone
bridge.
The
finest
ale
south
of
the
Neck,
everyone
said
so,
begging
your
pardons,
m’lord.
It’s
gone
now
like
all
the
rest,
m’lord.
They
come
and
drank
their
fill
and
spilled
the
rest
before
they
fired
my
roof,
and
they
would
of
spilled
my
blood
too,
if
they’d
caught
me.
M’lord.”

“They
burnt
us
out,”
a
farmer
beside
him
said.
“Come
riding
in
the
dark,
up
from
the
south,
and
fired
the
fields
and
the
houses
alike,
killing
them
as
tried
to
stop
them.
They
weren’t
no
raiders,
though,
m’lord.
They
had
no
mind
to
steal
our
stock,
not
these,
they
butchered
my
milk
cow
where
she
stood
and
left
her
for
the
flies
and
the
crows.”

“They
rode
down
my
’prentice
boy,”
said
a
squat
man
with
a
smith’s
muscles
and
a
bandage
around
his
head.
He
had
put
on
his
finest
clothes
to
come
to
court,
but
his
breeches
were
patched,
his
cloak
travel-stained
and
dusty.
“Chased
him
back
and
forth
across
the
fields
on
their
horses,
poking
at
him
with
their
lances
like
it
was
a
game,
them
laughing
and
the
boy
stumbling
and
screaming
till
the
big
one
pierced
him
clean
through.”

The
girl
on
her
knees
craned
her
head
up
at
Ned,
high
above
her
on
the
throne.
“They
killed
my
mother
too,
Your
Grace.
And
they…
they…”
Her
voice
trailed
off,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
she
was
about
to
say.
She
began
to
sob.

Ser
Raymun
Darry
took
up
the
tale.
“At
Wendish
Town,
the
people
sought
shelter
in
their
holdfast,
but
the
walls
were
timbered.
The
raiders
piled
straw
against
the
wood
and
burnt
them
all
alive.
When
the
Wendish
folk
opened
their
gates
to
flee
the
fire,
they
shot
them
down
with
arrows
as
they
came
running
out,
even
women
with
suckling
babes.”

“Oh,
dreadful,”
murmured
Varys.
“How
cruel
can
men
be?”

“They
would
of
done
the
same
for
us,
but
the
Sherrer
holdfast’s
made
of
stone,”
Joss
said.
“Some
wanted
to
smoke
us
out,
but
the
big
one
said
there
was
riper
fruit
upriver,
and
they
made
for
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

Ned
could
feel
cold
steel
against
his
fingers
as
he
leaned
forward.
Between
each
finger
was
a
blade,
the
points
of
twisted
swords
fanning
out
like
talons
from
arms
of
the
throne.
Even
after
three
centuries,
some
were
still
sharp
enough
to
cut.
The
Iron
Throne
was
full
of
traps
for
the
unwary.
The
songs
said
it
had
taken
a
thousand
blades
to
make
it,
heated
white-hot
in
the
furnace
breath
of
Balerion
the
Black
Dread.
The
hammering
had
taken
fifty-nine
days.
The
end
of
it
was
this
hunched
black
beast
made
of
razor
edges
and
barbs
and
ribbons
of
sharp
metal;
a
chair
that
could
kill
a
man,
and
had,
if
the
stories
could
be
believed.

What
Eddard
Stark
was
doing
sitting
there
he
would
never
comprehend,
yet
there
he
sat,
and
these
people
looked
to
him
for
justice.
“What
proof
do
you
have
that
these
were
Lannisters?”
he
asked,
trying
to
keep
his
fury
under
control.
“Did
they
wear
crimson
cloaks
or
fly
a
lion
banner?”

“Even
Lannisters
are
not
so
blind
stupid
as
that,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
snapped.
He
was
a
swaggering
bantam
rooster
of
a
youth,
too
young
and
too
hot-blooded
for
Ned’s
taste,
though
a
fast
friend
of
Catelyn’s
brother,
Edmure
Tully.

“Every
man
among
them
was
mounted
and
mailed,
my
lord,”
Ser
Karyl
answered
calmly.
“They
were
armed
with
steel-tipped
lances
and
longswords,
with
battle-axes
for
the
butchering.”
He
gestured
toward
one
of
the
ragged
survivors.
“You.
Yes,
you,
no
one’s
going
to
hurt
you.
Tell
the
Hand
what
you
told
me.”

The
old
man
bobbed
his
head.
“Concerning
their
horses,”
he
said,
“it
were
warhorses
they
rode.
Many
a
year
I
worked
in
old
Ser
Willum’s
stables,
so
I
knows
the
difference.
Not
a
one
of
these
ever
pulled
a
plow,
gods
bear
witness
if
I’m
wrong.”

“Well-mounted
brigands,”
observed
Littlefinger.
“Perhaps
they
stole
the
horses
from
the
last
place
they
raided.”

“How
many
men
were
there
in
this
raiding
party?”
Ned
asked.

“A
hundred,
at
the
least,”
Joss
answered,
in
the
same
instant
as
the
bandaged
smith
said,
“Fifty,”
and
the
grandmother
behind
him,
“Hunnerds
and
hunnerds,
m’lord,
an
army
they
was.”

“You
are
more
right
than
you
know,
goodwoman,”
Lord
Eddard
told
her.
“You
say
they
flew
no
banners.
What
of
the
armor
they
wore?
Did
any
of
you
note
ornaments
or
decorations,
devices
on
shield
or
helm?”

The
brewer,
Joss,
shook
his
head.
“It
grieves
me,
m’lord,
but
no,
the
armor
they
showed
us
was
plain,
only…
the
one
who
led
them,
he
was
armored
like
the
rest,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
all
the
same.
It
was
the
size
of
him,
m’lord.
Those
as
say
the
giants
are
all
dead
never
saw
this
one,
I
swear.
Big
as
an
ox
he
was,
and
a
voice
like
stone
breaking.”

“The
Mountain!”
Ser
Marq
said
loudly.
“Can
any
man
doubt
it?
This
was
Gregor
Clegane’s
work.”

Ned
heard
muttering
from
beneath
the
windows
and
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
Even
in
the
galley,
nervous
whispers
were
exchanged.
High
lords
and
smallfolk
alike
knew
what
it
could
mean
if
Ser
Marq
was
proved
right.
Ser
Gregor
Clegane
stood
bannerman
to
Lord
Tywin
Lannister.

He
studied
the
frightened
faces
of
the
villagers.
Small
wonder
they
had
been
so
fearful;
they
had
thought
they
were
being
dragged
here
to
name
Lord
Tywin
a
red-handed
butcher
before
a
king
who
was
his
son
by
marriage.
He
wondered
if
the
knights
had
given
them
a
choice.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
rose
ponderously
from
the
council
table,
his
chain
of
office
clinking.
“Ser
Marq,
with
respect,
you
cannot
know
that
this
outlaw
was
Ser
Gregor.
There
are
many
large
men
in
the
realm.”

“As
large
as
the
Mountain
That
Rides?”
Ser
Karyl
said.
“I
have
never
met
one.”

“Nor
has
any
man
here,”
Ser
Raymun
added
hotly.
“Even
his
brother
is
a
pup
beside
him.
My
lords,
open
your
eyes.
Do
you
need
to
see
his
seal
on
the
corpses?
It
was
Gregor.”

“Why
should
Ser
Gregor
turn
brigand?”
Pycelle
asked.
“By
the
grace
of
his
liege
lord,
he
holds
a
stout
keep
and
lands
of
his
own.
The
man
is
an
anointed
knight.”

“A
false
knight!”
Ser
Marq
said.
“Lord
Tywin’s
mad
dog.”

“My
lord
Hand,”
Pycelle
declared
in
a
stiff
voice,
“I
urge
you
to
remind
this
good
knight
that
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
is
the
father
of
our
own
gracious
queen.”

“Thank
you,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,”
Ned
said.
“I
fear
we
might
have
forgotten
that
if
you
had
not
pointed
it
out.”

From
his
vantage
point
atop
the
throne,
he
could
see
men
slipping
out
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall.
Hares
going
to
ground,
he
supposed…
or
rats
off
to
nibble
the
queen’s
cheese.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
Septa
Mordane
in
the
gallery,
with
his
daughter
Sansa
beside
her.
Ned
felt
a
flash
of
anger;
this
was
no
place
for
a
girl.
But
the
septa
could
not
have
known
that
today’s
court
would
be
anything
but
the
usual
tedious
business
of
hearing
petitions,
settling
disputes
between
rival
holdfasts,
and
adjudicating
the
placement
of
boundary
stones.

At
the
council
table
below,
Petyr
Baelish
lost
interest
in
his
quill
and
leaned
forward.
“Ser
Marq,
Ser
Karyl,
Ser
Raymun—perhaps
I
might
ask
you
a
question?
These
holdfasts
were
under
your
protection.
Where
were
you
when
all
this
slaughtering
and
burning
was
going
on?”

Ser
Karyl
Vance
answered.
“I
was
attending
my
lord
father
in
the
pass
below
the
Golden
Tooth,
as
was
Ser
Marq.
When
the
word
of
these
outrages
reached
Ser
Edmure
Tully,
he
sent
word
that
we
should
take
a
small
force
of
men
to
find
what
survivors
we
could
and
bring
them
to
the
king.”

Ser
Raymun
Darry
spoke
up.
“Ser
Edmure
had
summoned
me
to
Riverrun
with
all
my
strength.
I
was
camped
across
the
river
from
his
walls,
awaiting
his
commands,
when
the
word
reached
me.
By
the
time
I
could
return
to
my
own
lands,
Clegane
and
his
vermin
were
back
across
the
Red
Fork,
riding
for
Lannister’s
hills.”

Littlefinger
stroked
the
point
of
his
beard
thoughtfully.
“And
if
they
come
again,
ser?”

“If
they
come
again,
we’ll
use
their
blood
to
water
the
fields
they
burnt,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
declared
hotly.

“Ser
Edmure
has
sent
men
to
every
village
and
holdfast
within
a
day’s
ride
of
the
border,”
Ser
Karyl
explained.
“The
next
raider
will
not
have
such
an
easy
time
of
it.”

And
that
may
be
precisely
what
Lord
Tywin
wants,
Ned
thought
to
himself,
to
bleed
off
strength
from
Riverrun,
goad
the
boy
into
scattering
his
swords.
His
wife’s
brother
was
young,
and
more
gallant
than
wise.
He
would
try
to
hold
every
inch
of
his
soil,
to
defend
every
man,
woman,
and
child
who
named
him
lord,
and
Tywin
Lannister
was
shrewd
enough
to
know
that.

“If
your
fields
and
holdfasts
are
safe
from
harm,”
Lord
Petyr
was
saying,
“what
then
do
you
ask
of
the
throne?”

“The
lords
of
the
Trident
keep
the
king’s
peace,”
Ser
Raymun
Darry
said.
“The
Lannisters
have
broken
it.
We
ask
leave
to
answer
them,
steel
for
steel.
We
ask
justice
for
the
smallfolk
of
Sherrer
and
Wendish
Town
and
the
Mummer’s
Ford.”

“Edmure
agrees,
we
must
pay
Gregor
Clegane
back
his
bloody
coin,”
Ser
Marq
declared,
“but
old
Lord
Hoster
commanded
us
to
come
here
and
beg
the
king’s
leave
before
we
strike.”

Thank
the
gods
for
old
Lord
Hoster,
then.
Tywin
Lannister
was
as
much
fox
as
lion.
If
indeed
he’d
sent
Ser
Gregor
to
burn
and
pillage—and
Ned
did
not
doubt
that
he
had—he’d
taken
care
to
see
that
he
rode
under
cover
of
night,
without
banners,
in
the
guise
of
a
common
brigand.
Should
Riverrun
strike
back,
Cersei
and
her
father
would
insist
that
it
had
been
the
Tullys
who
broke
the
king’s
peace,
not
the
Lannisters.
The
gods
only
knew
what
Robert
would
believe.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
on
his
feet
again.
“My
lord
Hand,
if
these
good
folk
believe
that
Ser
Gregor
has
forsaken
his
holy
vows
for
plunder
and
rape,
let
them
go
to
his
liege
lord
and
make
their
complaint.
These
crimes
are
no
concern
of
the
throne.
Let
them
seek
Lord
Tywin’s
justice.”

“It
is
all
the
king’s
justice,”
Ned
told
him.
“North,
south,
east,
or
west,
all
we
do
we
do
in
Robert’s
name.”

“The
king’s
justice,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
said.
“So
it
is,
and
so
we
should
defer
this
matter
until
the
king—”

“The
king
is
hunting
across
the
river
and
may
not
return
for
days,”
Lord
Eddard
said.
“Robert
bid
me
to
sit
here
in
his
place,
to
listen
with
his
ears,
and
to
speak
with
his
voice.
I
mean
to
do
just
that…
though
I
agree
that
he
must
be
told.”
He
saw
a
familiar
face
beneath
the
tapestries.
“Ser
Robar.”

Ser
Robar
Royce
stepped
forward
and
bowed.
“My
lord.”

“Your
father
is
hunting
with
the
king,”
Ned
said.
“Will
you
bring
them
word
of
what
was
said
and
done
here
today?”

“At
once,
my
lord.”

“Do
we
have
your
leave
to
take
our
vengeance
against
Ser
Gregor,
then?”
Marq
Piper
asked
the
throne.

“Vengeance?”
Ned
said.
“I
thought
we
were
speaking
of
justice.
Burning
Clegane’s
fields
and
slaughtering
his
people
will
not
restore
the
king’s
peace,
only
your
injured
pride.”
He
glanced
away
before
the
young
knight
could
voice
his
outraged
protest,
and
addressed
the
villagers.
“People
of
Sherrer,
I
cannot
give
you
back
your
homes
or
your
crops,
nor
can
I
restore
your
dead
to
life.
But
perhaps
I
can
give
you
some
small
measure
of
justice,
in
the
name
of
our
king,
Robert.”

Every
eye
in
the
hall
was
fixed
on
him,
waiting.
Slowly
Ned
struggled
to
his
feet,
pushing
himself
up
from
the
throne
with
the
strength
of
his
arms,
his
shattered
leg
screaming
inside
its
cast.
He
did
his
best
to
ignore
the
pain;
it
was
no
moment
to
let
them
see
his
weakness.
“The
First
Men
believed
that
the
judge
who
called
for
death
should
wield
the
sword,
and
in
the
north
we
hold
to
that
still.
I
mislike
sending
another
to
do
my
killing…
yet
it
seems
I
have
no
choice.”
He
gestured
at
his
broken
leg.

“Lord
Eddard!”
The
shout
came
from
the
west
side
of
the
hall
as
a
handsome
stripling
of
a
boy
strode
forth
boldly.
Out
of
his
armor,
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
looked
even
younger
than
his
sixteen
years.
He
wore
pale
blue
silk,
his
belt
a
linked
chain
of
golden
roses,
the
sigil
of
his
House.
“I
beg
you
the
honor
of
acting
in
your
place.
Give
this
task
to
me,
my
lord,
and
I
swear
I
shall
not
fail
you.”

Littlefinger
chuckled.
“Ser
Loras,
if
we
send
you
off
alone,
Ser
Gregor
will
send
us
back
your
head
with
a
plum
stuffed
in
that
pretty
mouth
of
yours.
The
Mountain
is
not
the
sort
to
bend
his
neck
to
any
man’s
justice.”

“I
do
not
fear
Gregor
Clegane,”
Ser
Loras
said
haughtily.

Ned
eased
himself
slowly
back
onto
the
hard
iron
seat
of
Aegon’s
misshapen
throne.
His
eyes
searched
the
faces
along
the
wall.
“Lord
Beric,”
he
called
out.
“Thoros
of
Myr.
Ser
Gladden.
Lord
Lothar.”
The
men
named
stepped
forward
one
by
one.
“Each
of
you
is
to
assemble
twenty
men,
to
bring
my
word
to
Gregor’s
keep.
Twenty
of
my
own
guards
shall
go
with
you.
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion,
you
shall
have
the
command,
as
befits
your
rank.”

The
young
lord
with
the
red-gold
hair
bowed.
“As
you
command,
Lord
Eddard.”

Ned
raised
his
voice,
so
it
carried
to
the
far
end
of
the
throne
room.
“In
the
name
of
Robert
of
the
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
by
the
word
of
Eddard
of
the
House
Stark,
his
Hand,
I
charge
you
to
ride
to
the
westlands
with
all
haste,
to
cross
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident
under
the
king’s
flag,
and
there
bring
the
king’s
justice
to
the
false
knight
Gregor
Clegane,
and
to
all
those
who
shared
in
his
crimes.
I
denounce
him,
and
attaint
him,
and
strip
him
of
all
rank
and
titles,
of
all
lands
and
incomes
and
holdings,
and
do
sentence
him
to
death.
May
the
gods
take
pity
on
his
soul.”

When
the
echo
of
his
words
had
died
away,
the
Knight
of
Flowers
seemed
perplexed.
“Lord
Eddard,
what
of
me?”

Ned
looked
down
on
him.
From
on
high,
Loras
Tyrell
seemed
almost
as
young
as
Robb.
“No
one
doubts
your
valor,
Ser
Loras,
but
we
are
about
justice
here,
and
what
you
seek
is
vengeance.”
He
looked
back
to
Lord
Beric.
“Ride
at
first
light.
These
things
are
best
done
quickly.”
He
held
up
a
hand.
“The
throne
will
hear
no
more
petitions
today.”

Alyn
and
Porther
climbed
the
steep
iron
steps
to
help
him
back
down.
As
they
made
their
descent,
he
could
feel
Loras
Tyrell’s
sullen
stare,
but
the
boy
had
stalked
away
before
Ned
reached
the
floor
of
the
throne
room.

At
the
base
of
the
Iron
Throne,
Varys
was
gathering
papers
from
the
council
table.
Littlefinger
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
already
taken
their
leave.
“You
are
a
bolder
man
than
I,
my
lord,”
the
eunuch
said
softly.

“How
so,
Lord
Varys?”
Ned
asked
brusquely.
His
leg
was
throbbing,
and
he
was
in
no
mood
for
word
games.

“Had
it
been
me
up
there,
I
should
have
sent
Ser
Loras.
He
so
wanted
to
go…
and
a
man
who
has
the
Lannisters
for
his
enemies
would
do
well
to
make
the
Tyrells
his
friends.”

“Ser
Loras
is
young,”
said
Ned.
“I
daresay
he
will
outgrow
the
disappointment.”

“And
Ser
Ilyn?”
The
eunuch
stroked
a
plump,
powdered
cheek.
“He
is
the
King’s
Justice,
after
all.
Sending
other
men
to
do
his
office…
some
might
construe
that
as
a
grave
insult.”

“No
slight
was
intended.”
In
truth,
Ned
did
not
trust
the
mute
knight,
though
perhaps
that
was
only
because
he
misliked
executioners.
“I
remind
you,
the
Paynes
are
bannermen
to
House
Lannister.
I
thought
it
best
to
choose
men
who
owed
Lord
Tywin
no
fealty.”

“Very
prudent,
no
doubt,”
Varys
said.
“Still,
I
chanced
to
see
Ser
Ilyn
in
the
back
of
the
hall,
staring
at
us
with
those
pale
eyes
of
his,
and
I
must
say,
he
did
not
look
pleased,
though
to
be
sure
it
is
hard
to
tell
with
our
silent
knight.
I
hope
he
outgrows
his
disappointment
as
well.
He
does
so
love
his
work…”





SANSA

“He
wouldn’t
send
Ser
Loras,”
Sansa
told
Jeyne
Poole
that
night
as
they
shared
a
cold
supper
by
lamplight.
“I
think
it
was
because
of
his
leg.”

Lord
Eddard
had
taken
his
supper
in
his
bedchamber
with
Alyn,
Harwin,
and
Vayon
Poole,
the
better
to
rest
his
broken
leg,
and
Septa
Mordane
had
complained
of
sore
feet
after
standing
in
the
gallery
all
day.
Arya
was
supposed
to
join
them,
but
she
was
late
coming
back
from
her
dancing
lesson.

“His
leg?”
Jeyne
said
uncertainly.
She
was
a
pretty,
dark-haired
girl
of
Sansa’s
own
age.
“Did
Ser
Loras
hurt
his
leg?”

“Not
his
leg,”
Sansa
said,
nibbling
delicately
at
a
chicken
leg.
“Father’s
leg,
silly.
It
hurts
him
ever
so
much,
it
makes
him
cross.
Otherwise
I’m
certain
he
would
have
sent
Ser
Loras.”

Her
father’s
decision
still
bewildered
her.
When
the
Knight
of
Flowers
had
spoken
up,
she’d
been
sure
she
was
about
to
see
one
of
Old
Nan’s
stories
come
to
life.
Ser
Gregor
was
the
monster
and
Ser
Loras
the
true
hero
who
would
slay
him.
He
even
looked
a
true
hero,
so
slim
and
beautiful,
with
golden
roses
around
his
slender
waist
and
his
rich
brown
hair
tumbling
down
into
his
eyes.
And
then
Father
had
refused
him!
It
had
upset
her
more
than
she
could
tell.
She
had
said
as
much
to
Septa
Mordane
as
they
descended
the
stairs
from
the
gallery,
but
the
septa
had
only
told
her
it
was
not
her
place
to
question
her
lord
father’s
decisions.

That
was
when
Lord
Baelish
had
said,
“Oh,
I
don’t
know,
Septa.
Some
of
her
lord
father’s
decisions
could
do
with
a
bit
of
questioning.
The
young
lady
is
as
wise
as
she
is
lovely.”
He
made
a
sweeping
bow
to
Sansa,
so
deep
she
was
not
quite
sure
if
she
was
being
complimented
or
mocked.

Septa
Mordane
had
been
very
upset
to
realize
that
Lord
Baelish
had
overheard
them.
“The
girl
was
just
talking,
my
lord,”
she’d
said.
“Foolish
chatter.
She
meant
nothing
by
the
comment.”

Lord
Baelish
stroked
his
little
pointed
beard
and
said,
“Nothing?
Tell
me,
child,
why
would
you
have
sent
Ser
Loras?”

Sansa
had
no
choice
but
to
explain
about
heroes
and
monsters.
The
king’s
councillor
smiled.
“Well,
those
are
not
the
reasons
I’d
have
given,
but…”
He
had
touched
her
cheek,
his
thumb
lightly
tracing
the
line
of
a
cheekbone.
“Life
is
not
a
song,
sweetling.
You
may
learn
that
one
day
to
your
sorrow.”

Sansa
did
not
feel
like
telling
all
that
to
Jeyne,
however;
it
made
her
uneasy
just
to
think
back
on
it.

“Ser
Ilyn’s
the
King’s
Justice,
not
Ser
Loras,”
Jcyne
said.
“Lord
Eddard
should
have
sent
him.”

Sansa
shuddered.
Every
time
she
looked
at
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
she
shivered.
He
made
her
feel
as
though
something
dead
were
slithering
over
her
naked
skin.
“Ser
Ilyn’s
almost
like
a
second
monster.
I’m
glad
Father
didn’t
pick
him.”

“Lord
Beric
is
as
much
a
hero
as
Ser
Loras.
He’s
ever
so
brave
and
gallant.”

“I
suppose,”
Sansa
said
doubtfully.
Beric
Dondarrion
was
handsome
enough,
but
he
was
awfully
old,
almost
twenty-two;
the
Knight
of
Flowers
would
have
been
much
better.
Of
course,
Jeyne
had
been
in
love
with
Lord
Beric
ever
since
she
had
first
glimpsed
him
in
the
lists.
Sansa
thought
she
was
being
silly;
Jeyne
was
only
a
steward’s
daughter,
after
all,
and
no
matter
how
much
she
mooned
after
him,
Lord
Beric
would
never
look
at
someone
so
far
beneath
him,
even
if
she
hadn’t
been
half
his
age.

It
would
have
been
unkind
to
say
so,
however,
so
Sansa
took
a
sip
of
milk
and
changed
the
subject.
“I
had
a
dream
that
Joffrey
would
be
the
one
to
take
the
white
hart,”
she
said.
It
had
been
more
of
a
wish,
actually,
but
it
sounded
better
to
call
it
a
dream.
Everyone
knew
that
dreams
were
prophetic.
White
harts
were
supposed
to
be
very
rare
and
magical,
and
in
her
heart
she
knew
her
gallant
prince
was
worthier
than
his
drunken
father.

“A
dream?
Truly?
Did
Prince
Joffrey
just
go
up
to
it
and
touch
it
with
his
bare
hand
and
do
it
no
harm?”

“No,”
Sansa
said.
“He
shot
it
with
a
golden
arrow
and
brought
it
back
for
me.”
In
the
songs,
the
knights
never
killed
magical
beasts,
they
just
went
up
to
them
and
touched
them
and
did
them
no
harm,
but
she
knew
Joffrey
liked
hunting,
especially
the
killing
part.
Only
animals,
though.
Sansa
was
certain
her
prince
had
no
part
in
murdering
Jory
and
those
other
poor
men;
that
had
been
his
wicked
uncle,
the
Kingslayer.
She
knew
her
father
was
still
angry
about
that,
but
it
wasn’t
fair
to
blame
Joff.
That
would
be
like
blaming
her
for
something
that
Arya
had
done.

“I
saw
your
sister
this
afternoon,”
Jeyne
blurted
out,
as
if
she’d
been
reading
Sansa’s
thoughts.
“She
was
walking
through
the
stables
on
her
hands.
Why
would
she
do
a
thing
like
that?”

“I’m
sure
I
don’t
know
why
Arya
does
anything.”
Sansa
hated
stables,
smelly
places
full
of
manure
and
flies.
Even
when
she
went
riding,
she
liked
the
boy
to
saddle
the
horse
and
bring
it
to
her
in
the
yard.
“Do
you
want
to
hear
about
the
court
or
not?”

“I
do,”
Jeyne
said.

“There
was
a
black
brother,”
Sansa
said,
“begging
men
for
the
Wall,
only
he
was
kind
of
old
and
smelly.”
She
hadn’t
liked
that
at
all.
She
had
always
imagined
the
Night’s
Watch
to
be
men
like
Uncle
Benjen.
In
the
songs,
they
were
called
the
black
knights
of
the
Wall.
But
this
man
had
been
crookbacked
and
hideous,
and
he
looked
as
though
he
might
have
lice.
If
this
was
what
the
Night’s
Watch
was
truly
like,
she
felt
sorry
for
her
bastard
half
brother,
Jon.
“Father
asked
if
there
were
any
knights
in
the
hall
who
would
do
honor
to
their
houses
by
taking
the
black,
but
no
one
came
forward,
so
he
gave
this
Yoren
his
pick
of
the
king’s
dungeons
and
sent
him
on
his
way.
And
later
these
two
brothers
came
before
him,
freeriders
from
the
Dornish
Marches,
and
pledged
their
swords
to
the
service
of
the
king.
Father
accepted
their
oaths…”

Jeyne
yawned.
“Are
there
any
lemon
cakes?”

Sansa
did
not
like
being
interrupted,
but
she
had
to
admit,
lemon
cakes
sounded
more
interesting
than
most
of
what
had
gone
on
in
the
throne
room.
“Let’s
see,”
she
said.

The
kitchen
yielded
no
lemon
cakes,
but
they
did
find
half
of
a
cold
strawberry
pie,
and
that
was
almost
as
good.
They
ate
it
on
the
tower
steps,
giggling
and
gossiping
and
sharing
secrets,
and
Sansa
went
to
bed
that
night
feeling
almost
as
wicked
as
Arya.

The
next
morning
she
woke
before
first
light
and
crept
sleepily
to
her
window
to
watch
Lord
Beric
form
up
his
men.
They
rode
out
as
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
city,
with
three
banners
going
before
them;
the
crowned
stag
of
the
king
flew
from
the
high
staff,
the
direwolf
of
Stark
and
Lord
Beric’s
own
forked
lightning
standard
from
shorter
poles.
It
was
all
so
exciting,
a
song
come
to
life;
the
clatter
of
swords,
the
flicker
of
torchlight,
banners
dancing
in
the
wind,
horses
snorting
and
whinnying,
the
golden
glow
of
sunrise
slanting
through
the
bars
of
the
portcullis
as
it
jerked
upward.
The
Winterfell
men
looked
especially
fine
in
their
silvery
mail
and
long
grey
cloaks.

Alyn
carried
the
Stark
banner.
When
she
saw
him
rein
in
beside
Lord
Beric
to
exchange
words,
it
made
Sansa
feel
ever
so
proud.
Alyn
was
handsomer
than
Jory
had
been;
he
was
going
to
be
a
knight
one
day.

The
Tower
of
the
Hand
seemed
so
empty
after
they
left
that
Sansa
was
even
pleased
to
see
Arya
when
she
went
down
to
break
her
fast.
“Where
is
everyone?”
her
sister
wanted
to
know
as
she
ripped
the
skin
from
a
blood
orange.
“Did
Father
send
them
to
hunt
down
Jaime
Lannister?”

Sansa
sighed.
“They
rode
with
Lord
Beric,
to
behead
Ser
Gregor
Clegane.”
She
turned
to
Septa
Mordane,
who
was
eating
porridge
with
a
wooden
spoon.
“Septa,
will
Lord
Beric
spike
Ser
Gregor’s
head
on
his
own
gate
or
bring
it
back
here
for
the
king?”
She
and
Jeyne
Poole
had
been
arguing
over
that
last
night.

The
septa
was
horror-struck.
“A
lady
does
not
discuss
such
things
over
her
porridge.
Where
are
your
courtesies,
Sansa?
I
swear,
of
late
you’ve
been
near
as
bad
as
your
sister.”

“What
did
Gregor
do?”
Arya
asked.

“He
burned
down
a
holdfast
and
murdered
a
lot
of
people,
women
and
children
too.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face
in
a
scowl.
“Jaime
Lannister
murdered
Jory
and
Heward
and
Wyl,
and
the
Hound
murdered
Mycah.
Somebody
should
have
beheaded
them.”

“It’s
not
the
same,”
Sansa
said.
“The
Hound
is
Joffrey’s
sworn
shield.
Your
butcher’s
boy
attacked
the
prince.”

“Liar,”
Arya
said.
Her
hand
clenched
the
blood
orange
so
hard
that
red
juice
oozed
between
her
fingers.

“Go
ahead,
call
me
all
the
names
you
want,”
Sansa
said
airily.
“You
won’t
dare
when
I’m
married
to
Joffrey.
You’ll
have
to
bow
to
me
and
call
me
Your
Grace.”
She
shrieked
as
Arya
flung
the
orange
across
the
table.
It
caught
her
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
with
a
wet
squish
and
plopped
down
into
her
lap.

“You
have
juice
on
your
face,
Your
Grace,”
Arya
said.

It
was
running
down
her
nose
and
stinging
her
eyes.
Sansa
wiped
it
away
with
a
napkin.
When
she
saw
what
the
fruit
in
her
lap
had
done
to
her
beautiful
ivory
silk
dress,
she
shrieked
again.
“You’re
horrible,”
she
screamed
at
her
sister.
“They
should
have
killed
you
instead
of
Lady!”

Septa
Mordane
came
lurching
to
her
feet.
“Your
lord
father
will
hear
of
this!
Go
to
your
chambers,
at
once.
At
once!”

“Me
too?”
Tears
welled
in
Sansa’s
eyes.
“That’s
not
fair.”

“The
matter
is
not
subject
to
discussion.
Go!”

Sansa
stalked
away
with
her
head
up.
She
was
to
be
a
queen,
and
queens
did
not
cry.
At
least
not
where
people
could
see.
When
she
reached
her
bedchamber,
she
barred
the
door
and
took
off
her
dress.
The
blood
orange
had
left
a
blotchy
red
stain
on
the
silk.
“I
hate
her!”
she
screamed.
She
balled
up
the
dress
and
flung
it
into
the
cold
hearth,
on
top
of
the
ashes
of
last
night’s
fire.
When
she
saw
that
the
stain
had
bled
through
onto
her
underskirt,
she
began
to
sob
despite
herself.
She
ripped
off
the
rest
of
her
clothes
wildly,
threw
herself
into
bed,
and
cried
herself
back
to
sleep.

It
was
midday
when
Septa
Mordane
knocked
upon
her
door.
“Sansa.
Your
lord
father
will
see
you
now.”

Sansa
sat
up.
“Lady,”
she
whispered.
For
a
moment
it
was
as
if
the
direwolf
was
there
in
the
room,
looking
at
her
with
those
golden
eyes,
sad
and
knowing.
She
had
been
dreaming,
she
realized.
Lady
was
with
her,
and
they
were
running
together,
and…
and…
trying
to
remember
was
like
trying
to
catch
the
rain
with
her
fingers.
The
dream
faded,
and
Lady
was
dead
again.

“Sansa.”
The
rap
came
again,
sharply.
“Do
you
hear
me?”

“Yes,
Septa,”
she
called
out.
“Might
I
have
a
moment
to
dress,
please?”
Her
eyes
were
red
from
crying,
but
she
did
her
best
to
make
herself
beautiful.

Lord
Eddard
was
bent
over
a
huge
leather-bound
book
when
Septa
Mordane
marched
her
into
the
solar,
his
plaster-wrapped
leg
stiff
beneath
the
table.
“Come
here,
Sansa,”
he
said,
not
unkindly,
when
the
septa
had
gone
for
her
sister.
“Sit
beside
me.”
He
closed
the
book.

Septa
Mordane
returned
with
Arya
squirming
in
her
grasp.
Sansa
had
put
on
a
lovely
pale
green
damask
gown
and
a
look
of
remorse,
but
her
sister
was
still
wearing
the
ratty
leathers
and
roughspun
she’d
worn
at
breakfast.
“Here
is
the
other
one,”
the
septa
announced.

“My
thanks,
Septa
Mordane.
I
would
talk
to
my
daughters
alone,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”
The
septa
bowed
and
left.

“Arya
started
it,”
Sansa
said
quickly,
anxious
to
have
the
first
word.
“She
called
me
a
liar
and
threw
an
orange
at
me
and
spoiled
my
dress,
the
ivory
silk,
the
one
Queen
Cersei
gave
me
when
I
was
betrothed
to
Prince
Joffrey.
She
hates
that
I’m
going
to
marry
the
prince.
She
tries
to
spoil
everything,
Father,
she
can’t
stand
for
anything
to
be
beautiful
or
nice
or
splendid.”

“Enough,
Sansa.”
Lord
Eddard’s
voice
was
sharp
with
impatience.

Arya
raised
her
eyes.
“I’m
sorry,
Father.
I
was
wrong
and
I
beg
my
sweet
sister’s
forgiveness.”

Sansa
was
so
startled
that
for
a
moment
she
was
speechless.
Finally
she
found
her
voice.
“What
about
my
dress?”

“Maybe…
I
could
wash
it,”
Arya
said
doubtfully.

“Washing
won’t
do
any
good,”
Sansa
said.
“Not
if
you
scrubbed
all
day
and
all
night.
The
silk
is
ruined.”

“Then
I’ll…
make
you
a
new
one,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
threw
back
her
head
in
disdain.
“You?
You
couldn’t
sew
a
dress
fit
to
clean
the
pigsties.”

Their
father
sighed.
“I
did
not
call
you
here
to
talk
of
dresses.
I’m
sending
you
both
back
to
Winterfell.”

For
the
second
time
Sansa
found
herself
too
stunned
for
words.
She
felt
her
eyes
grow
moist
again.

“You
can’t,”
Arya
said.

“Please,
Father,”
Sansa
managed
at
last.
“Please
don’t.”

Eddard
Stark
favored
his
daughters
with
a
tired
smile.
“At
last
we’ve
found
something
you
agree
on.”

“I
didn’t
do
anything
wrong,”
Sansa
pleaded
with
him.
“I
don’t
want
to
go
back.”
She
loved
Mng’s
Landing;
the
pagaentry
of
the
court,
the
high
lords
and
ladies
in
their
velvets
and
silks
and
gemstones,
the
great
city
with
all
its
people.
The
tournament
had
been
the
most
magical
time
of
her
whole
life,
and
there
was
so
much
she
had
not
seen
yet,
harvest
feasts
and
masked
balls
and
mummer
shows.
She
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
losing
it
all.
“Send
Arya
away,
she
started
it,
Father,
I
swear
it.
I’ll
be
good,
you’ll
see,
just
let
me
stay
and
I
promise
to
be
as
fine
and
noble
and
courteous
as
the
queen.”

Father’s
mouth
twitched
strangely.
“Sansa,
I’m
not
sending
you
away
for
fighting,
though
the
gods
know
I’m
sick
of
you
two
squabbling.
I
want
you
back
in
Winterfell
for
your
own
safety.
Three
of
my
men
were
cut
down
like
dogs
not
a
league
from
where
we
sit,
and
what
does
Robert
do?
He
goes
hunting.”

Arya
was
chewing
at
her
lip
in
that
disgusting
way
she
had.
“Can
we
take
Syrio
back
with
us?”

“Who
cares
about
your
stupid
dancing
master?”
Sansa
flared.
“Father,
I
only
just
now
remembered,
I
can’t
go
away,
I’m
to
marry
Prince
Joffrey.”
She
tried
to
smile
bravely
for
him.
“I
love
him,
Father,
I
truly
truly
do,
I
love
him
as
much
as
Queen
Naerys
loved
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
as
much
as
Jonquil
loved
Ser
Florian.
I
want
to
be
his
queen
and
have
his
babies.”

“Sweet
one,”
her
father
said
gently,
“listen
to
me.
When
you’re
old
enough,
I
will
make
you
a
match
with
a
high
lord
who’s
worthy
of
you,
someone
brave
and
gentle
and
strong.
This
match
with
Joffrey
was
a
terrible
mistake.
That
boy
is
no
Prince
Aemon,
you
must
believe
me.”

“He
is!”
Sansa
insisted.
“I
don’t
want
someone
brave
and
gentle,
I
want
him.
We’ll
be
ever
so
happy,
just
like
in
the
songs,
you’ll
see.
I’ll
give
him
a
son
with
golden
hair,
and
one
day
he’ll
be
the
king
of
all
the
realm,
the
greatest
king
that
ever
was,
as
brave
as
the
wolf
and
as
proud
as
the
lion.”

Arya
made
a
face.
“Not
if
Joffrey’s
his
father,”
she
said.
“He’s
a
liar
and
a
craven
and
anyhow
he’s
a
stag,
not
a
lion.”

Sansa
felt
tears
in
her
eyes.
“He
is
not!
He’s
not
the
least
bit
like
that
old
drunken
king,”
she
screamed
at
her
sister,
forgetting
herself
in
her
grief.

Father
looked
at
her
strangely.
“Gods,”
he
swore
softly,
“out
of
the
mouth
of
babes…”
He
shouted
for
Septa
Mordane.
To
the
girls
he
said,
“I
am
looking
for
a
fast
trading
galley
to
take
you
home.
These
days,
the
sea
is
safer
than
the
kingsroad.
You
will
sail
as
soon
as
I
can
find
a
proper
ship,
with
Septa
Mordane
and
a
complement
of
guards…
and
yes,
with
Syrio
Forel,
if
he
agrees
to
enter
my
service.
But
say
nothing
of
this.
It’s
better
if
no
one
knows
of
our
plans.
We’ll
talk
again
tomorrow.”

Sansa
cried
as
Septa
Mordane
marched
them
down
the
steps.
They
were
going
to
take
it
all
away;
the
tournaments
and
the
court
and
her
prince,
everything,
they
were
going
to
send
her
back
to
the
bleak
grey
walls
of
Winterfell
and
lock
her
up
forever.
Her
life
was
over
before
it
had
begun.

“Stop
that
weeping,
child,”
Septa
Mordane
said
sternly.
“I
am
certain
your
lord
father
knows
what
is
best
for
you.”

“It
won’t
be
so
bad,
Sansa,”
Arya
said.
“We’re
going
to
sail
on
a
galley.
It
will
be
an
adventure,
and
then
we’ll
be
with
Bran
and
Robb
again,
and
Old
Nan
and
Hodor
and
the
rest.”
She
touched
her
on
the
arm.

“Hodor!”
Sansa
yelled.
“You
ought
to
marry
Hodor,
you’re
just
like
him,
stupid
and
hairy
and
ugly!”
She
wrenched
away
from
her
sister’s
hand,
stormed
into
her
bedchamber,
and
barred
the
door
behind
her.





EDDARD

“Pain
is
a
gift
from
the
gods,
Lord
Eddard,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
told
him.
“It
means
the
bone
is
knitting,
the
flesh
healing
itself.
Be
thankful.”

“I
will
be
thankful
when
my
leg
stops
throbbing.”

Pycelle
set
a
stoppered
flask
on
the
table
by
the
bed.
“The
milk
of
the
poppy,
for
when
the
pain
grows
too
onerous.”

“I
sleep
too
much
already.”

“Sleep
is
the
great
healer.”

“I
had
hoped
that
was
you.”

Pycelle
smiled
wanly.
“It
is
good
to
see
you
in
such
a
fierce
humor,
my
lord.”
He
leaned
close
and
lowered
his
voice.
“There
was
a
raven
this
morning,
a
letter
for
the
queen
from
her
lord
father.
I
thought
you
had
best
know.”

“Dark
wings,
dark
words,”
Ned
said
grimly.
“What
of
it?”

“Lord
Tywin
is
greatly
wroth
about
the
men
you
sent
after
Ser
Gregor
Clegane,”
the
maester
confided.
“I
feared
he
would
be.
You
will
recall,
I
said
as
much
in
council.”

“Let
him
be
wroth,”
Ned
said.
Every
time
his
leg
throbbed,
he
remembered
Jaime
Lannister’s
smile,
and
Jory
dead
in
his
arms.
“Let
him
write
all
the
letters
to
the
queen
he
likes.
Lord
Beric
rides
beneath
the
king’s
own
banner.
If
Lord
Tywin
attempts
to
interfere
with
the
king’s
justice,
he
will
have
Robert
to
answer
to.
The
only
thing
His
Grace
enjoys
more
than
hunting
is
making
war
on
lords
who
defy
him.”

Pycelle
pulled
back,
his
maester’s
chain
jangling.
“As
you
say.
I
shall
visit
again
on
the
morrow.”
The
old
man
hurriedly
gathered
up
his
things
and
took
his
leave.
Ned
had
little
doubt
that
he
was
bound
straight
for
the
royal
apartments,
to
whisper
at
the
queen.
I
thought
you
had
best
know,
indeed…
as
if
Cersei
had
not
instructed
him
to
pass
along
her
father’s
threats.
He
hoped
his
response
rattled
those
perfect
teeth
of
hers.
Ned
was
not
near
as
confident
of
Robert
as
he
pretended,
but
there
was
no
reason
Cersei
need
know
that.

When
Pycelle
was
gone,
Ned
called
for
a
cup
of
honeyed
wine.
That
clouded
the
mind
as
well,
yet
not
as
badly.
He
needed
to
be
able
to
think.
A
thousand
times,
he
asked
himself
what
Jon
Arryn
might
have
done,
had
he
lived
long
enough
to
act
on
what
he’d
learned.
Or
perhaps
he
had
acted,
and
died
for
it.

It
was
queer
how
sometimes
a
child’s
innocent
eyes
can
see
things
that
grown
men
are
blind
to.
Someday,
when
Sansa
was
grown,
he
would
have
to
tell
her
how
she
had
made
it
all
come
clear
for
him.
He’s
not
the
least
bit
like
that
old
drunken
king,
she
had
declared,
angry
and
unknowing,
and
the
simple
truth
of
it
had
twisted
inside
him,
cold
as
death.
This
was
the
sword
that
killed
Jon
Arryn,
Ned
thought
then,
and
it
will
kill
Robert
as
well,
a
slower
death
but
full
as
certain.
Shattered
legs
may
heal
in
time,
but
some
betrayals
fester
and
poison
the
soul.

Littlefinger
came
calling
an
hour
after
the
Grand
Maester
had
left,
clad
in
a
plum-colored
doublet
with
a
mockingbird
embroidered
on
the
breast
in
black
thread,
and
a
striped
cloak
of
black
and
white.
“I
cannot
visit
long,
my
lord,”
he
announced.
“Lady
Tanda
expects
me
to
lunch
with
her.
No
doubt
she
will
roast
me
a
fatted
calf.
If
it’s
near
as
fatted
as
her
daughter,
I’m
like
to
rupture
and
die.
And
how
is
your
leg?”

“Inflamed
and
painful,
with
an
itch
that
is
driving
me
mad.”

Littlefinger
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“In
future,
try
not
to
let
any
horses
fall
on
it.
I
would
urge
you
to
heal
quickly.
The
realm
grows
restive.
Varys
has
heard
ominous
whispers
from
the
west.
Freeriders
and
sellswords
have
been
flocking
to
Casterly
Rock,
and
not
for
the
thin
pleasure
of
Lord
Tywin’s
conversation.”

“Is
there
word
of
the
king?”
Ned
demanded.
“Just
how
long
does
Robert
intend
to
hunt?”

“Given
his
preferences,
I
believe
he’d
stay
in
the
forest
until
you
and
the
queen
both
die
of
old
age,”
Lord
Petyr
replied
with
a
faint
smile.
“Lacking
that,
I
imagine
he’ll
return
as
soon
as
he’s
killed
something.
They
found
the
white
hart,
it
seems…
or
rather,
what
remained
of
it.
Some
wolves
found
it
first,
and
left
His
Grace
scarcely
more
than
a
hoof
and
a
horn.
Robert
was
in
a
fury,
until
he
heard
talk
of
some
monstrous
boar
deeper
in
the
forest.
Then
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
have
it.
Prince
Joffrey
returned
this
morning,
with
the
Royces,
Ser
Balon
Swann,
and
some
twenty
others
of
the
party.
The
rest
are
still
with
the
king.”

“The
Hound?”
Ned
asked,
frowning.
Of
all
the
Lannister
party,
Sandor
Clegane
was
the
one
who
concerned
him
the
most,
now
that
Ser
Jaime
had
fled
the
city
to
join
his
father.

“Oh,
returned
with
Joffrey,
and
went
straight
to
the
queen.”
Littlefinger
smiled.
“I
would
have
given
a
hundred
silver
stags
to
have
been
a
roach
in
the
rushes
when
he
learned
that
Lord
Beric
was
off
to
behead
his
brother.”

“Even
a
blind
man
could
see
the
Hound
loathed
his
brother.”

“Ah,
but
Gregor
was
his
to
loathe,
not
yours
to
kill.
Once
Dondarrion
lops
the
summit
off
our
Mountain,
the
Clegane
lands
and
incomes
will
pass
to
Sandor,
but
I
wouldn’t
hold
my
water
waiting
for
his
thanks,
not
that
one.
And
now
you
must
forgive
me.
Lady
Tanda
awaits
with
her
fatted
calves.”

On
the
way
to
the
door,
Lord
Petyr
spied
Grand
Maester
Malleon’s
massive
tome
on
the
table
and
paused
to
idly
flip
open
the
cover.
“The
Lineages
and
Histories
of
the
Great
Houses
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
With
Descriptions
of
Many
High
Lords
and
Noble
Ladies
and
Their
Children,”
he
read.
“Now
there
is
tedious
reading
if
ever
I
saw
it.
A
sleeping
potion,
my
lord?”

For
a
brief
moment
Ned
considered
telling
him
all
of
it,
but
there
was
something
in
Littlefinger’s
japes
that
irked
him.
The
man
was
too
clever
by
half,
a
mocking
smile
never
far
from
his
lips.
“Jon
Arryn
was
studying
this
volume
when
he
was
taken
sick,”
Ned
said
in
a
careful
tone,
to
see
how
he
might
respond.

And
he
responded
as
he
always
did:
with
a
quip.
“In
that
case,”
he
said,
“death
must
have
come
as
a
blessed
relief.”
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
bowed
and
took
his
leave.

Eddard
Stark
allowed
himself
a
curse.
Aside
from
his
own
retainers,
there
was
scarcely
a
man
in
this
city
he
trusted.
Littlefinger
had
concealed
Catelyn
and
helped
Ned
in
his
inquiries,
yet
his
haste
to
save
his
own
skin
when
Jaime
and
his
swords
had
come
out
of
the
rain
still
rankled.
Varys
was
worse.
For
all
his
protestations
of
loyalty,
the
eunuch
knew
too
much
and
did
too
little.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
seemed
more
Cersei’s
creature
with
every
passing
day,
and
Ser
Barristan
was
an
old
man,
and
rigid.
He
would
tell
Ned
to
do
his
duty.

Time
was
perilously
short.
The
king
would
return
from
his
hunt
soon,
and
honor
would
require
Ned
to
go
to
him
with
all
he
had
learned.
Vayon
Poole
had
arranged
for
Sansa
and
Arya
to
sail
on
the
Wind
Witch
out
of
Braavos,
three
days
hence.
They
would
be
back
at
Winterfell
before
the
harvest.
Ned
could
no
longer
use
his
concern
for
their
safety
to
excuse
his
delay.

Yet
last
night
he
had
dreamt
of
Rhaegar’s
children.
Lord
Tywin
had
laid
the
bodies
beneath
the
Iron
Throne,
wrapped
in
the
crimson
cloaks
of
his
house
guard.
That
was
clever
of
him;
the
blood
did
not
show
so
badly
against
the
red
cloth.
The
little
princess
had
been
barefoot,
still
dressed
in
her
bed
gown,
and
the
boy…
the
boy…

Ned
could
not
let
that
happen
again.
The
realm
could
not
withstand
a
second
mad
king,
another
dance
of
blood
and
vengeance.
He
must
find
some
way
to
save
the
children.

Robert
could
be
merciful.
Ser
Barristan
was
scarcely
the
only
man
he
had
pardoned.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
Varys
the
Spider,
Lord
Balon
Greyjoy;
each
had
been
counted
an
enemy
to
Robert
once,
and
each
had
been
welcomed
into
friendship
and
allowed
to
retain
honors
and
office
for
a
pledge
of
fealty.
So
long
as
a
man
was
brave
and
honest,
Robert
would
treat
him
with
all
the
honor
and
respect
due
a
valiant
enemy.

This
was
something
else:
poison
in
the
dark,
a
knife
thrust
to
the
soul.
This
he
could
never
forgive,
no
more
than
he
had
forgiven
Rhaegar.
He
will
kill
them
all,
Ned
realized.

And
yet,
he
knew
he
could
not
keep
silent.
He
had
a
duty
to
Robert,
to
the
realm,
to
the
shade
of
Jon
Arryn…
and
to
Bran,
who
surely
must
have
stumbled
on
some
part
of
the
truth.
Why
else
would
they
have
tried
to
slay
him?

Late
that
afternoon
he
summoned
Tomard,
the
portly
guardsman
with
the
ginger-colored
whiskers
his
children
called
Fat
Tom.
With
Jory
dead
and
Alyn
gone,
Fat
Tom
had
command
of
his
household
guard.
The
thought
filled
Ned
with
vague
disquiet.
Tomard
was
a
solid
man;
affable,
loyal,
tireless,
capable
in
a
limited
way,
but
he
was
near
fifty,
and
even
in
his
youth
he
had
never
been
energetic.
Perhaps
Ned
should
not
have
been
so
quick
to
send
off
half
his
guard,
and
all
his
best
swords
among
them.

“I
shall
require
your
help,”
Ned
said
when
Tomard
appeared,
looking
faintly
apprehensive,
as
he
always
did
when
called
before
his
lord.
“Take
me
to
the
godswood.”

“Is
that
wise,
Lord
Eddard?
With
your
leg
and
all?”

“Perhaps
not.
But
necessary.”

Tomard
summoned
Varly.
With
one
arm
around
each
man’s
shoulders,
Ned
managed
to
descend
the
steep
tower
steps
and
hobble
across
the
bailey.
“I
want
the
guard
doubled,”
he
told
Fat
Tom.
“No
one
enters
or
leaves
the
Tower
of
the
Hand
without
my
leave.”

Tom
blinked.
“M’lord,
with
Alyn
and
the
others
away,
we
are
hard-pressed
already—”

“It
will
only
be
a
short
while.
Lengthen
the
watches.”

“As
you
say,
m’lord,”
Tom
answered.
“Might
I
ask
why—”

“Best
not,”
Ned
answered
crisply.

The
godswood
was
empty,
as
it
always
was
here
in
this
citadel
of
the
southron
gods.
Ned’s
leg
was
screaming
as
they
lowered
him
to
the
grass
beside
the
heart
tree.
“Thank
you.”
He
drew
a
paper
from
his
sleeve,
sealed
with
the
sigil
of
his
House.
“Kindly
deliver
this
at
once.”

Tomard
looked
at
the
name
Ned
had
written
on
the
paper
and
licked
his
lips
anxiously.
“My
lord…”

“Do
as
I
bid
you,
Tom,”
Ned
said.

How
long
he
waited
in
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
he
could
not
say.
It
was
peaceful
here.
The
thick
walls
shut
out
the
clamor
of
the
castle,
and
he
could
hear
birds
singing,
the
murmur
of
crickets,
leaves
rustling
in
a
gentle
wind.
The
heart
tree
was
an
oak,
brown
and
faceless,
yet
Ned
Stark
still
felt
the
presence
of
his
gods.
His
leg
did
not
seem
to
hurt
so
much.

She
came
to
him
at
sunset,
as
the
clouds
reddened
above
the
walls
and
towers.
She
came
alone,
as
he
had
bid
her.
For
once
she
was
dressed
simply,
in
leather
boots
and
hunting
greens.
When
she
drew
back
the
hood
of
her
brown
cloak,
he
saw
the
bruise
where
the
king
had
struck
her.
The
angry
plum
color
had
faded
to
yellow,
and
the
swelling
was
down,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
it
for
anything
but
what
it
was.

“Why
here?”
Cersei
Lannister
asked
as
she
stood
over
him.

“So
the
gods
can
see.”

She
sat
beside
him
on
the
grass.
Her
every
move
was
graceful.
Her
curling
blond
hair
moved
in
the
wind,
and
her
eyes
were
green
as
the
leaves
of
summer.
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
Ned
Stark
had
seen
her
beauty,
but
he
saw
it
now.
“I
know
the
truth
Jon
Arryn
died
for,”
he
told
her.

“Do
you?”
The
queen
watched
his
face,
wary
as
a
cat.
“Is
that
why
you
called
me
here,
Lord
Stark?
To
pose
me
riddles?
Or
is
it
your
intent
to
seize
me,
as
your
wife
seized
my
brother?”

“If
you
truly
believed
that,
you
would
never
have
come.”
Ned
touched
her
cheek
gently.
“Has
he
done
this
before?”

“Once
or
twice.”
She
shied
away
from
his
hand.
“Never
on
the
face
before.
Jaime
would
have
killed
him,
even
if
it
meant
his
own
life.”
Cersei
looked
at
him
defiantly.
“My
brother
is
worth
a
hundred
of
your
friend.”

“Your
brother?”
Ned
said.
“Or
your
lover?”

“Both.”
She
did
not
flinch
from
the
truth.
“Since
we
were
children
together.
And
why
not?
The
Targaryens
wed
brother
to
sister
for
three
hundred
years,
to
keep
the
bloodlines
pure.
And
Jaime
and
I
are
more
than
brother
and
sister.
We
are
one
person
in
two
bodies.
We
shared
a
womb
together.
He
came
into
this
world
holding
my
foot,
our
old
maester
said.
When
he
is
in
me,
I
feel…
whole.”
The
ghost
of
a
smile
flitted
over
her
lips.

“My
son
Bran…”

To
her
credit,
Cersei
did
not
look
away.
“He
saw
us.
You
love
your
children,
do
you
not?”

Robert
had
asked
him
the
very
same
question,
the
morning
of
the
melee.
He
gave
her
the
same
answer.
“With
all
my
heart.”

“No
less
do
I
love
mine.”

Ned
thought,
If
it
came
to
that,
the
life
of
some
child
I
did
not
know,
against
Robb
and
Sansa
and
Arya
and
Bran
and
Rickon,
what
would
I
do?
Even
more
so,
what
would
Catelyn
do,
if
it
were
Jon’s
life,
against
the
children
of
her
body?
He
did
not
know.
He
prayed
he
never
would.

“All
three
are
Jaime’s,”
he
said.
It
was
not
a
question.

“Thank
the
gods.”

The
seed
is
strong,
Jon
Arryn
had
cried
on
his
deathbed,
and
so
it
was.
All
those
bastards,
all
with
hair
as
black
as
night.
Grand
Maester
Malleon
recorded
the
last
mating
between
stag
and
lion,
some
ninety
years
ago,
when
Tya
Lannister
wed
Gowen
Baratheon,
third
son
of
the
reigning
lord.
Their
only
issue,
an
unnamed
boy
described
in
Malleon’s
tome
as
a
large
and
lusty
lad
born
with
a
full
head
of
black
hair,
died
in
infancy.
Thirty
years
before
that
a
male
Lannister
had
taken
a
Baratheon
maid
to
wife.
She
had
given
him
three
daughters
and
a
son,
each
black-haired.
No
matter
how
far
back
Ned
searched
in
the
brittle
yellowed
pages,
always
he
found
the
gold
yielding
before
the
coal.

“A
dozen
years,”
Ned
said.
“How
is
it
that
you
have
had
no
children
by
the
king?”

She
lifted
her
head,
defiant.
“Your
Robert
got
me
with
child
once,”
she
said,
her
voice
thick
with
contempt.
“My
brother
found
a
woman
to
cleanse
me.
He
never
knew.
If
truth
be
told,
I
can
scarcely
bear
for
him
to
touch
me,
and
I
have
not
let
him
inside
me
for
years.
I
know
other
ways
to
pleasure
him,
when
he
leaves
his
whores
long
enough
to
stagger
up
to
my
bedchamber.
Whatever
we
do,
the
king
is
usually
so
drunk
that
he’s
forgotten
it
all
by
the
next
morning.”

How
could
they
have
all
been
so
blind?
The
truth
was
there
in
front
of
them
all
the
time,
written
on
the
children’s
faces.
Ned
felt
sick.
“I
remember
Robert
as
he
was
the
day
he
took
the
throne,
every
inch
a
king,”
he
said
quietly.
“A
thousand
other
women
might
have
loved
him
with
all
their
hearts.
What
did
he
do
to
make
you
hate
him
so?”

Her
eyes
burned,
green
fire
in
the
dusk,
like
the
lioness
that
was
her
sigil.
“The
night
of
our
wedding
feast,
the
first
time
we
shared
a
bed,
he
called
me
by
your
sister’s
name.
He
was
on
top
of
me,
in
me,
stinking
of
wine,
and
he
whispered
Lyanna.”

Ned
Stark
thought
of
pale
blue
roses,
and
for
a
moment
he
wanted
to
weep.
“I
do
not
know
which
of
you
I
pity
most.”

The
queen
seemed
amused
by
that.
“Save
your
pity
for
yourself,
Lord
Stark.
I
want
none
of
it.”

“You
know
what
I
must
do.”

“Must?”
She
put
her
hand
on
his
good
leg,
just
above
the
knee.
“A
true
man
does
what
he
will,
not
what
he
must.”
Her
fingers
brushed
lightly
against
his
thigh,
the
gentlest
of
promises.
“The
realm
needs
a
strong
Hand.
Joff
will
not
come
of
age
for
years.
No
one
wants
war
again,
least
of
all
me.”
Her
hand
touched
his
face,
his
hair.
“If
friends
can
turn
to
enemies,
enemies
can
become
friends.
Your
wife
is
a
thousand
leagues
away,
and
my
brother
has
fled.
Be
kind
to
me,
Ned.
I
swear
to
you,
you
shall
never
regret
it.”

“Did
you
make
the
same
offer
to
Jon
Arryn?”

She
slapped
him.

“I
shall
wear
that
as
a
badge
of
honor,”
Ned
said
dryly.

“Honor,”
she
spat.
“How
dare
you
play
the
noble
lord
with
me!
What
do
you
take
me
for?
You’ve
a
bastard
of
your
own,
I’ve
seen
him.
Who
was
the
mother,
I
wonder?
Some
Dornish
peasant
you
raped
while
her
holdfast
burned?
A
whore?
Or
was
it
the
grieving
sister,
the
Lady
Ashara?
She
threw
herself
into
the
sea,
I’m
told.
Why
was
that?
For
the
brother
you
slew,
or
the
child
you
stole?
Tell
me,
my
honorable
Lord
Eddard,
how
are
you
any
different
from
Robert,
or
me,
or
Jaime?”

“For
a
start,”
said
Ned,
“I
do
not
kill
children.
You
would
do
well
to
listen,
my
lady.
I
shall
say
this
only
once.
When
the
king
returns
from
his
hunt,
I
intend
to
lay
the
truth
before
him.
You
must
be
gone
by
then.
You
and
your
children,
all
three,
and
not
to
Casterly
Rock.
If
I
were
you,
I
should
take
ship
for
the
Free
Cities,
or
even
farther,
to
the
Summer
Isles
or
the
Port
of
Ibben.
As
far
as
the
winds
blow.”

“Exile,”
she
said.
“A
bitter
cup
to
drink
from.”

“A
sweeter
cup
than
your
father
served
Rhaegar’s
children,”
Ned
said,
“and
kinder
than
you
deserve.
Your
father
and
your
brothers
would
do
well
to
go
with
you.
Lord
Tywin’s
gold
will
buy
you
comfort
and
hire
swords
to
keep
you
safe.
You
shall
need
them.
I
promise
you,
no
matter
where
you
flee,
Robert’s
wrath
will
follow
you,
to
the
back
of
beyond
if
need
be.”

The
queen
stood.
“And
what
of
my
wrath,
Lord
Stark?”
she
asked
softly.
Her
eyes
searched
his
face.
“You
should
have
taken
the
realm
for
yourself.
It
was
there
for
the
taking.
Jaime
told
me
how
you
found
him
on
the
Iron
Throne
the
day
King’s
Landing
fell,
and
made
him
yield
it
up.
That
was
your
moment.
All
you
needed
to
do
was
climb
those
steps,
and
sit.
Such
a
sad
mistake.”

“I
have
made
more
mistakes
than
you
can
possibly
imagine,”
Ned
said,
“but
that
was
not
one
of
them.”

“Oh,
but
it
was,
my
lord,”
Cersei
insisted.
“When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die.
There
is
no
middle
ground.”

She
turned
up
her
hood
to
hide
her
swollen
face
and
left
him
there
in
the
dark
beneath
the
oak,
amidst
the
quiet
of
the
godswood,
under
a
blue-black
sky.
The
stars
were
coming
out.





DAENERYS

The
heart
was
steaming
in
the
cool
evening
air
when
Khal
Drogo
set
it
before
her,
raw
and
bloody.
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow.
Behind
him,
his
bloodriders
knelt
on
the
sand
beside
the
corpse
of
the
wild
stallion,
stone
knives
in
their
hands.
The
stallion’s
blood
looked
black
in
the
flickering
orange
glare
of
the
torches
that
ringed
the
high
chalk
walls
of
the
pit.

Dany
touched
the
soft
swell
of
her
belly.
Sweat
beaded
her
skin
and
trickled
down
her
brow.
She
could
feel
the
old
women
watching
her,
the
ancient
crones
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
with
eyes
that
shone
dark
as
polished
flint
in
their
wrinkled
faces.
She
must
not
flinch
or
look
afraid.
I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
told
herself
as
she
took
the
stallion’s
heart
in
both
hands,
lifted
it
to
her
mouth,
and
plunged
her
teeth
into
the
tough,
stringy
flesh.

Warm
blood
filled
her
mouth
and
ran
down
over
her
chin.
The
taste
threatened
to
gag
her,
but
she
made
herself
chew
and
swallow.
The
heart
of
a
stallion
would
make
her
son
strong
and
swift
and
fearless,
or
so
the
Dothraki
believed,
but
only
if
the
mother
could
eat
it
all.
If
she
choked
on
the
blood
or
retched
up
the
flesh,
the
omens
were
less
favorable;
the
child
might
be
stillborn,
or
come
forth
weak,
deformed,
or
female.

Her
handmaids
had
helped
her
ready
herself
for
the
ceremony.
Despite
the
tender
mother’s
stomach
that
had
afflicted
her
these
past
two
moons,
Dany
had
dined
on
bowls
of
half-clotted
blood
to
accustom
herself
to
the
taste,
and
Irri
made
her
chew
strips
of
dried
horseflesh
until
her
jaws
were
aching.
She
had
starved
herself
for
a
day
and
a
night
before
the
ceremony
in
the
hopes
that
hunger
would
help
her
keep
down
the
raw
meat.

The
wild
stallion’s
heart
was
all
muscle,
and
Dany
had
to
worry
it
with
her
teeth
and
chew
each
mouthful
a
long
time.
No
steel
was
permitted
within
the
sacred
confines
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
Mother
of
Mountains;
she
had
to
rip
the
heart
apart
with
teeth
and
nails.
Her
stomach
roiled
and
heaved,
yet
she
kept
on,
her
face
smeared
with
the
heartsblood
that
sometimes
seemed
to
explode
against
her
lips.

Khal
Drogo
stood
over
her
as
she
ate,
his
face
as
hard
as
a
bronze
shield.
His
long
black
braid
was
shiny
with
oil.
He
wore
gold
rings
in
his
mustache,
gold
bells
in
his
braid,
and
a
heavy
belt
of
solid
gold
medallions
around
his
waist,
but
his
chest
was
bare.
She
looked
at
him
whenever
she
felt
her
strength
failing;
looked
at
him,
and
chewed
and
swallowed,
chewed
and
swallowed,
chewed
and
swallowed.
Toward
the
end,
Dany
thought
she
glimpsed
a
fierce
pride
in
his
dark,
almond-shaped
eyes,
but
she
could
not
be
sure.
The
khal’s
face
did
not
often
betray
the
thoughts
within.

And
finally
it
was
done.
Her
cheeks
and
fingers
were
sticky
as
she
forced
down
the
last
of
it.
Only
then
did
she
turn
her
eyes
back
to
the
old
women,
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen.

“Khalakka
dothrae
mr’anha!”
she
proclaimed
in
her
best
Dothraki.
A
prince
rides
inside
me!
She
had
practiced
the
phrase
for
days
with
her
handmaid
Jhiqui.

The
oldest
of
the
crones,
a
bent
and
shriveled
stick
of
a
woman
with
a
single
black
eye,
raised
her
arms
on
high.
“Khalakka
dothrae!”
she
shrieked.
The
prince
is
riding!

“He
is
riding!”
the
other
women
answered.
“Rakh!
Rakh!
Rakh
haj!”
they
proclaimed.
A
boy,
a
boy,
a
strong
boy.

Bells
rang,
a
sudden
clangor
of
bronze
birds.
A
deep-throated
warhorn
sounded
its
long
low
note.
The
old
women
began
to
chant.
Underneath
their
painted
leather
vests,
their
withered
dugs
swayed
back
and
forth,
shiny
with
oil
and
sweat.
The
eunuchs
who
served
them
threw
bundles
of
dried
grasses
into
a
great
bronze
brazier,
and
clouds
of
fragrant
smoke
rose
up
toward
the
moon
and
the
stars.
The
Dothraki
believed
the
stars
were
horses
made
of
fire,
a
great
herd
that
galloped
across
the
sky
by
night.

As
the
smoke
ascended,
the
chanting
died
away
and
the
ancient
crone
closed
her
single
eye,
the
better
to
peer
into
the
future.
The
silence
that
fell
was
complete.
Dany
could
hear
the
distant
call
of
night
birds,
the
hiss
and
crackle
of
the
torches,
the
gentle
lapping
of
water
from
the
lake.
The
Dothraki
stared
at
her
with
eyes
of
night,
waiting.

Khal
Drogo
laid
his
hand
on
Dany’s
arm.
She
could
feel
the
tension
in
his
fingers.
Even
a
khal
as
mighty
as
Drogo
could
know
fear
when
the
dosh
khaleen
peered
into
smoke
of
the
future.
At
her
back,
her
handmaids
fluttered
anxiously.

Finally
the
crone
opened
her
eye
and
lifted
her
arms.
“I
have
seen
his
face,
and
heard
the
thunder
of
his
hooves,”
she
proclaimed
in
a
thin,
wavery
voice.

“The
thunder
of
his
hooves!”
the
others
chorused.

“As
swift
as
the
wind
he
rides,
and
behind
him
his
khalasar
covers
the
earth,
men
without
number,
with
arakhs
shining
in
their
hands
like
blades
of
razor
grass.
Fierce
as
a
storm
this
prince
will
be.
His
enemies
will
tremble
before
him,
and
their
wives
will
weep
tears
of
blood
and
rend
their
flesh
in
grief.
The
bells
in
his
hair
will
sing
his
coming,
and
the
milk
men
in
the
stone
tents
will
fear
his
name.”
The
old
woman
trembled
and
looked
at
Dany
almost
as
if
she
were
afraid.
“The
prince
is
riding,
and
he
shall
be
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”

“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world!”
the
onlookers
cried
in
echo,
until
the
night
rang
to
the
sound
of
their
voices.

The
one-eyed
crone
peered
at
Dany.
“What
shall
he
be
called,
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world?”

She
stood
to
answer.
“He
shall
be
called
Rhaego,”
she
said,
using
the
words
that
Jhiqui
had
taught
her.
Her
hands
touched
the
swell
beneath
her
breasts
protectively
as
a
roar
went
up
from
the
Dothraki.
“Rhaego,”
they
screamed.
“Rhaego,
Rhaego,
Rhaego!”

The
name
was
still
ringing
in
her
ears
as
Khal
Drogo
led
her
from
the
pit.
His
bloodriders
fell
in
behind
them.
A
procession
followed
them
out
onto
the
godsway,
the
broad
grassy
road
that
ran
through
the
heart
of
Vaes
Dothrak,
from
the
horse
gate
to
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
The
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
came
first,
with
their
eunuchs
and
slaves.
Some
supported
themselves
with
tall
carved
staffs
as
they
struggled
along
on
ancient,
shaking
legs,
while
others
walked
as
proud
as
any
horselord.
Each
of
the
old
women
had
been
a
khaleesi
once.
When
their
lord
husbands
died
and
a
new
khal
took
his
place
at
the
front
of
his
riders,
with
a
new
khaleesi
mounted
beside
him,
they
were
sent
here,
to
reign
over
the
vast
Dothraki
nation.
Even
the
mightiest
of
khals
bowed
to
the
wisdom
and
authority
of
the
dosh
khaleen.
Still,
it
gave
Dany
the
shivers
to
think
that
one
day
she
might
be
sent
to
join
them,
whether
she
willed
it
or
no.

Behind
the
wise
women
came
the
others;
Khal
Ogo
and
his
son,
the
khalakka
Fogo,
Khal
Jommo
and
his
wives,
the
chief
men
of
Drogo’s
khalasar,
Dany’s
handmaids,
the
khal’s
servants
and
slaves,
and
more.
Bells
rang
and
drums
beat
a
stately
cadence
as
they
marched
along
the
godsway.
Stolen
heroes
and
the
gods
of
dead
peoples
brooded
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
road.
Alongside
the
procession,
slaves
ran
lightly
through
the
grass
with
torches
in
their
hands,
and
the
flickering
flames
made
the
great
monuments
seem
almost
alive.

“What
is
meaning,
name
Rhaego?”
Khal
Drogo
asked
as
they
walked,
using
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
She
had
been
teaching
him
a
few
words
when
she
could.
Drogo
was
quick
to
learn
when
he
put
his
mind
to
it,
though
his
accent
was
so
thick
and
barbarous
that
neither
Ser
Jorah
nor
Viserys
could
understand
a
word
he
said.

“My
brother
Rhaegar
was
a
fierce
warrior,
my
sun-and-stars,”
she
told
him.
“He
died
before
I
was
born.
Ser
Jorah
says
that
he
was
the
last
of
the
dragons.”

Khal
Drogo
looked
down
at
her.
His
face
was
a
copper
mask,
yet
under
the
long
black
mustache,
drooping
beneath
the
weight
of
its
gold
rings,
she
thought
she
glimpsed
the
shadow
of
a
smile.
“Is
good
name,
Dan
Ares
wife,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
said.

They
rode
to
the
lake
the
Dothraki
called
the
Womb
of
the
World,
surrounded
by
a
fringe
of
reeds,
its
water
still
and
calm.
A
thousand
thousand
years
ago,
Jhiqui
told
her,
the
first
man
had
emerged
from
its
depths,
riding
upon
the
back
of
the
first
horse.

The
procession
waited
on
the
grassy
shore
as
Dany
stripped
and
let
her
soiled
clothing
fall
to
the
ground.
Naked,
she
stepped
gingerly
into
the
water.
Irri
said
the
lake
had
no
bottom,
but
Dany
felt
soft
mud
squishing
between
her
toes
as
she
pushed
through
the
tall
reeds.
The
moon
floated
on
the
still
black
waters,
shattering
and
re-forming
as
her
ripples
washed
over
it.
Goose
pimples
rose
on
her
pale
skin
as
the
coldness
crept
up
her
thighs
and
kissed
her
lower
lips.
The
stallion’s
blood
had
dried
on
her
hands
and
around
her
mouth.
Dany
cupped
her
fingers
and
lifted
the
sacred
waters
over
her
head,
cleansing
herself
and
the
child
inside
her
while
the
khal
and
the
others
looked
on.
She
heard
the
old
women
of
the
dosh
khaleen
muttering
to
each
other
as
they
watched,
and
wondered
what
they
were
saying.

When
she
emerged
from
the
lake,
shivering
and
dripping,
her
handmaid
Doreah
hurried
to
her
with
a
robe
of
painted
sandsilk,
but
Khal
Drogo
waved
her
away.
He
was
looking
on
her
swollen
breasts
and
the
curve
of
her
belly
with
approval,
and
Dany
could
see
the
shape
of
his
manhood
pressing
through
his
horsehide
trousers,
below
the
heavy
gold
medallions
of
his
belt.
She
went
to
him
and
helped
him
unlace.
Then
her
huge
khal
took
her
by
the
hips
and
lifted
her
into
the
air,
as
he
might
lift
a
child.
The
bells
in
his
hair
rang
softly.

Dany
wrapped
her
arms
around
his
shoulders
and
pressed
her
face
against
his
neck
as
he
thrust
himself
inside
her.
Three
quick
strokes
and
it
was
done.
“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world,”
Drogo
whispered
hoarsely.
His
hands
still
smelled
of
horse
blood.
He
bit
at
her
throat,
hard,
in
the
moment
of
his
pleasure,
and
when
he
lifted
her
off,
his
seed
filled
her
and
trickled
down
the
inside
of
her
thighs.
Only
then
was
Doreah
permitted
to
drape
her
in
the
scented
sandsilk,
and
Irri
to
fit
soft
slippers
to
her
feet.

Khal
Drogo
laced
himself
up
and
spoke
a
command,
and
horses
were
brought
to
the
lakeshore.
Cohollo
had
the
honor
of
helping
the
khaleesi
onto
her
silver.
Drogo
spurred
his
stallion,
and
set
off
down
the
godsway
beneath
the
moon
and
stars.
On
her
silver,
Dany
easily
kept
pace.

The
silk
tenting
that
roofed
Khal
Drogo’s
hall
had
been
rolled
up
tonight,
and
the
moon
followed
them
inside.
Flames
leapt
ten
feet
in
the
air
from
three
huge
stone-lined
firepits.
The
air
was
thick
with
the
smells
of
roasting
meat
and
curdled,
fermented
mare’s
milk.
The
hall
was
crowded
and
noisy
when
they
entered,
the
cushions
packed
with
those
whose
rank
and
name
were
not
sufficient
to
allow
them
at
the
ceremony.
As
Dany
rode
beneath
the
arched
entry
and
up
the
center
aisle,
every
eye
was
on
her.
The
Dothraki
screamed
out
comments
on
her
belly
and
her
breasts,
hailing
the
life
within
her.
She
could
not
understand
all
they
shouted,
but
one
phrase
came
clear.
“The
stallion
that
mounts
the
world,”
she
heard,
bellowed
in
a
thousand
voices.

The
sounds
of
drums
and
horns
swirled
up
into
the
night.
Half-clothed
women
spun
and
danced
on
the
low
tables,
amid
joints
of
meat
and
platters
piled
high
with
plums
and
dates
and
pomegranates.
Many
of
the
men
were
drunk
on
clotted
mare’s
milk,
yet
Dany
knew
no
arakhs
would
clash
tonight,
not
here
in
the
sacred
city,
where
blades
and
bloodshed
were
forbidden.

Khal
Drogo
dismounted
and
took
his
place
on
the
high
bench.
Khal
Jommo
and
Khal
Ogo,
who
had
been
in
Vaes
Dothrak
with
their
khalasars
when
they
arrived,
were
given
seats
of
high
honor
to
Drogo’s
right
and
left.
The
bloodriders
of
the
three
khals
sat
below
them,
and
farther
down
Khal
Jommo’s
four
wives.

Dany
climbed
off
her
silver
and
gave
the
reins
to
one
of
the
slaves.
As
Doreah
and
Irri
arranged
her
cushions,
she
searched
for
her
brother.
Even
across
the
length
of
the
crowded
hall,
Viserys
should
have
been
conspicuous
with
his
pale
skin,
silvery
hair,
and
beggar’s
rags,
but
she
did
not
see
him
anywhere.

Her
glance
roamed
the
crowded
tables
near
the
walls,
where
men
whose
braids
were
even
shorter
than
their
manhoods
sat
on
frayed
rugs
and
flat
cushions
around
the
low
tables,
but
all
the
faces
she
saw
had
black
eyes
and
copper
skin.
She
spied
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
near
the
center
of
the
hall,
close
to
the
middle
firepit.
It
was
a
place
of
respect,
if
not
high
honor;
the
Dothraki
esteemed
the
knight’s
prowess
with
a
sword.
Dany
sent
Jhiqui
to
bring
him
to
her
table.
Mormont
came
at
once,
and
went
to
one
knee
before
her.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said,
“I
am
yours
to
command.”

She
patted
the
stuffed
horsehide
cushion
beside
her.
“Sit
and
talk
with
me.”

“You
honor
me.”
The
knight
seated
himself
cross-legged
on
the
cushion.
A
slave
knelt
before
him,
offering
a
wooden
platter
full
of
ripe
figs.
Ser
Jorah
took
one
and
bit
it
in
half.

“Where
is
my
brother?”
Dany
asked.
“He
ought
to
have
come
by
now,
for
the
feast.”

“I
saw
His
Grace
this
morning,”
he
told
her.
“He
told
me
he
was
going
to
the
Western
Market,
in
search
of
wine.”

“Wine?”
Dany
said
doubtfully.
Viserys
could
not
abide
the
taste
of
the
fermented
mare’s
milk
the
Dothraki
drank,
she
knew
that,
and
he
was
oft
at
the
bazaars
these
days,
drinking
with
the
traders
who
came
in
the
great
caravans
from
east
and
west.
He
seemed
to
find
their
company
more
congenial
than
hers.

“Wine,”
Ser
Jorah
confirmed,
“and
he
has
some
thought
to
recruit
men
for
his
army
from
the
sellswords
who
guard
the
caravans.”
A
serving
girl
laid
a
blood
pie
in
front
of
him,
and
he
attacked
it
with
both
hands.

“Is
that
wise?”
she
asked.
“He
has
no
gold
to
pay
soldiers.
What
if
he’s
betrayed?”
Caravan
guards
were
seldom
troubled
much
by
thoughts
of
honor,
and
the
Usurper
in
King’s
Landing
would
pay
well
for
her
brother’s
head.
“You
ought
to
have
gone
with
him,
to
keep
him
safe.
You
are
his
sworn
sword.”

“We
are
in
Vaes
Dothrak,”
he
reminded
her.
“No
one
may
carry
a
blade
here
or
shed
a
man’s
blood.”

“Yet
men
die,”
she
said.
“Jhogo
told
me.
Some
of
the
traders
have
eunuchs
with
them,
huge
men
who
strangle
thieves
with
wisps
of
silk.
That
way
no
blood
is
shed
and
the
gods
are
not
angered.”

“Then
let
us
hope
your
brother
will
be
wise
enough
not
to
steal
anything.”
Ser
Jorah
wiped
the
grease
off
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
leaned
close
over
the
table.
“He
had
planned
to
take
your
dragon’s
eggs,
until
I
warned
him
that
I’d
cut
off
his
hand
if
he
so
much
as
touched
them.”

For
a
moment
Dany
was
so
shocked
she
had
no
words.
“My
eggs…
but
they’re
mine,
Magister
Illyrio
gave
them
to
me,
a
bride
gift,
why
would
Viserys
want…
they’re
only
stones…”

“The
same
could
be
said
of
rubies
and
diamonds
and
fire
opals,
Princess…
and
dragon’s
eggs
are
rarer
by
far.
Those
traders
he’s
been
drinking
with
would
sell
their
own
manhoods
for
even
one
of
those
stones,
and
with
all
three
Viserys
could
buy
as
many
sellswords
as
he
might
need.”

Dany
had
not
known,
had
not
even
suspected.
“Then…
he
should
have
them.
He
does
not
need
to
steal
them.
He
had
only
to
ask.
He
is
my
brother…
and
my
true
king.”

“He
is
your
brother,”
Ser
Jorah
acknowledged.

“You
do
not
understand,
ser,”
she
said.
“My
mother
died
giving
me
birth,
and
my
father
and
my
brother
Rhaegar
even
before
that.
I
would
never
have
known
so
much
as
their
names
if
Viserys
had
not
been
there
to
tell
me.
He
was
the
only
one
left.
The
only
one.
He
is
all
I
have.”

“Once,”
said
Ser
Jorah.
“No
longer,
Khaleesi.
You
belong
to
the
Dothraki
now.
In
your
womb
rides
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”
He
held
out
his
cup,
and
a
slave
filled
it
with
fermented
mare’s
milk,
sour-smelling
and
thick
with
clots.

Dany
waved
her
away.
Even
the
smell
of
it
made
her
feel
ill,
and
she
would
take
no
chances
of
bringing
up
the
horse
heart
she
had
forced
herself
to
eat.
“What
does
it
mean?”
she
asked.
“What
is
this
stallion?
Everyone
was
shouting
it
at
me,
but
I
don’t
understand.”

“The
stallion
is
the
khal
of
khals
promised
in
ancient
prophecy,
child.
He
will
unite
the
Dothraki
into
a
single
khalasar
and
ride
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,
or
so
it
was
promised.
All
the
people
of
the
world
will
be
his
herd.”

“Oh,”
Dany
said
in
a
small
voice.
Her
hand
smoothed
her
robe
down
over
the
swell
of
her
stomach.
“I
named
him
Rhaego.”

“A
name
to
make
the
Usurper’s
blood
run
cold.”

Suddenly
Doreah
was
tugging
at
her
elbow.
“My
lady,”
the
handmaid
whispered
urgently,
“your
brother…”

Dany
looked
down
the
length
of
the
long,
roofless
hall
and
there
he
was,
striding
toward
her.
From
the
lurch
in
his
step,
she
could
tell
at
once
that
Viserys
had
found
his
wine…
and
something
that
passed
for
courage.

He
was
wearing
his
scarlet
silks,
soiled
and
travel-stained.
His
cloak
and
gloves
were
black
velvet,
faded
from
the
sun.
His
boots
were
dry
and
cracked,
his
silver-blond
hair
matted
and
tangled.
A
longsword
swung
from
his
belt
in
a
leather
scabbard.
The
Dothraki
eyed
the
sword
as
he
passed;
Dany
heard
curses
and
threats
and
angry
muttering
rising
all
around
her,
like
a
tide.
The
music
died
away
in
a
nervous
stammering
of
drums.

A
sense
of
dread
closed
around
her
heart.
“Go
to
him,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.
“Stop
him.
Bring
him
here.
Tell
him
he
can
have
the
dragon’s
eggs
if
that
is
what
he
wants.”
The
knight
rose
swiftly
to
his
feet.

“Where
is
my
sister?”
Viserys
shouted,
his
voice
thick
with
wine.
“I’ve
come
for
her
feast.
How
dare
you
presume
to
eat
without
me?
No
one
eats
before
the
king.
Where
is
she?
The
whore
can’t
hide
from
the
dragon.”

He
stopped
beside
the
largest
of
the
three
firepits,
peering
around
at
the
faces
of
the
Dothraki.
There
were
five
thousand
men
in
the
hall,
but
only
a
handful
who
knew
the
Common
Tongue.
Yet
even
if
his
words
were
incomprehensible,
you
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
know
that
he
was
drunk.

Ser
Jorah
went
to
him
swiftly,
whispered
something
in
his
ear,
and
took
him
by
the
arm,
but
Viserys
wrenched
free.
“Keep
your
hands
off
me!
No
one
touches
the
dragon
without
leave.”

Dany
glanced
anxiously
up
at
the
high
bench.
Khal
Drogo
was
saying
something
to
the
other
khals
beside
him.
Khal
Jommo
grinned,
and
Khal
Ogo
began
to
guffaw
loudly.

The
sound
of
laughter
made
Viserys
lift
his
eyes.
“Khal
Drogo,”
he
said
thickly,
his
voice
almost
polite.
“I’m
here
for
the
feast.”
He
staggered
away
from
Ser
Jorah,
making
to
join
the
three
khals
on
the
high
bench.

Khal
Drogo
rose,
spat
out
a
dozen
words
in
Dothraki,
faster
than
Dany
could
understand,
and
pointed.
“Khal
Drogo
says
your
place
is
not
on
the
high
bench,”
Ser
Jorah
translated
for
her
brother.
“Khal
Drogo
says
your
place
is
there.”

Viserys
glanced
where
the
khal
was
pointing.
At
the
back
of
the
long
hall,
in
a
corner
by
the
wall,
deep
in
shadow
so
better
men
would
not
need
to
look
on
them,
sat
the
lowest
of
the
low;
raw
unblooded
boys,
old
men
with
clouded
eyes
and
stiff
joints,
the
dim-witted
and
the
maimed.
Far
from
the
meat,
and
farther
from
honor.
“That
is
no
place
for
a
king,”
her
brother
declared.

“Is
place,”
Khal
Drogo
answered,
in
the
Common
Tongue
that
Dany
had
taught
him,
“for
Sorefoot
King.”
He
clapped
his
hands
together.
“A
cart!
Bring
cart
for
Khal
Rhaggat!”

Five
thousand
Dothraki
began
to
laugh
and
shout.
Ser
Jorah
was
standing
beside
Viserys,
screaming
in
his
ear,
but
the
roar
in
the
hall
was
so
thunderous
that
Dany
could
not
hear
what
he
was
saying.
Her
brother
shouted
back
and
the
two
men
grappled,
until
Mormont
knocked
Viserys
bodily
to
the
floor.

Her
brother
drew
his
sword.

The
bared
steel
shone
a
fearful
red
in
the
glare
from
the
firepits.
“Keep
away
from
me!”
Viserys
hissed.
Ser
Jorah
backed
off
a
step,
and
her
brother
climbed
unsteadily
to
his
feet.
He
waved
the
sword
over
his
head,
the
borrowed
blade
that
Magister
Illyrio
had
given
him
to
make
him
seem
more
kingly.
Dothraki
were
shrieking
at
him
from
all
sides,
screaming
vile
curses.

Dany
gave
a
wordless
cry
of
terror.
She
knew
what
a
drawn
sword
meant
here,
even
if
her
brother
did
not.

Her
voice
made
Viserys
turn
his
head,
and
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time.
“There
she
is,”
he
said,
smiling.
He
stalked
toward
her,
slashing
at
the
air
as
if
to
cut
a
path
through
a
wall
of
enemies,
though
no
one
tried
to
bar
his
way.

“The
blade…
you
must
not,”
she
begged
him.
“Please,
Viserys.
It
is
forbidden.
Put
down
the
sword
and
come
share
my
cushions.
There’s
drink,
food…
is
it
the
dragon’s
eggs
you
want?
You
can
have
them,
only
throw
away
the
sword.”

“Do
as
she
tells
you,
fool,”
Ser
Jorah
shouted,
“before
you
get
us
all
killed.”

Viserys
laughed.
“They
can’t
kill
us.
They
can’t
shed
blood
here
in
the
sacred
city…
but
I
can.”
He
laid
the
point
of
his
sword
between
Daenerys’s
breasts
and
slid
it
downward,
over
the
curve
of
her
belly.
“I
want
what
I
came
for,”
he
told
her.
“I
want
the
crown
he
promised
me.
He
bought
you,
but
he
never
paid
for
you.
Tell
him
I
want
what
I
bargained
for,
or
I’m
taking
you
back.
You
and
the
eggs
both.
He
can
keep
his
bloody
foal.
I’ll
cut
the
bastard
out
and
leave
it
for
him.”
The
sword
point
pushed
through
her
silks
and
pricked
at
her
navel.
Viserys
was
weeping,
she
saw;
weeping
and
laughing,
both
at
the
same
time,
this
man
who
had
once
been
her
brother.

Distantly,
as
from
far
away,
Dany
heard
her
handmaid
Jhiqui
sobbing
in
fear,
pleading
that
she
dared
not
translate,
that
the
khal
would
bind
her
and
drag
her
behind
his
horse
all
the
way
up
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
She
put
her
arm
around
the
girl.
“Don’t
be
afraid,”
she
said.
“I
shall
tell
him.”

She
did
not
know
if
she
had
enough
words,
yet
when
she
was
done
Khal
Drogo
spoke
a
few
brusque
sentences
in
Dothraki,
and
she
knew
he
understood.
The
sun
of
her
life
stepped
down
from
the
high
bench.
“What
did
he
say?”
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother
asked
her,
flinching.

It
had
grown
so
silent
in
the
hall
that
she
could
hear
the
bells
in
Khal
Drogo’s
hair,
chiming
softly
with
each
step
he
took.
His
bloodriders
followed
him,
like
three
copper
shadows.
Daenerys
had
gone
cold
all
over.
“He
says
you
shall
have
a
splendid
golden
crown
that
men
shall
tremble
to
behold.”

Viserys
smiled
and
lowered
his
sword.
That
was
the
saddest
thing,
the
thing
that
tore
at
her
afterward…
the
way
he
smiled.
“That
was
all
I
wanted,”
he
said.
“What
was
promised.”

When
the
sun
of
her
life
reached
her,
Dany
slid
an
arm
around
his
waist.
The
khal
said
a
word,
and
his
bloodriders
leapt
forward.
Qotho
seized
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother
by
the
arms.
Haggo
shattered
his
wrist
with
a
single,
sharp
twist
of
his
huge
hands.
Cohollo
pulled
the
sword
from
his
limp
fingers.
Even
now
Viserys
did
not
understand.
“No,”
he
shouted,
“you
cannot
touch
me,
I
am
the
dragon,
the
dragon,
and
I
will
be
crowned!”

Khal
Drogo
unfastened
his
belt.
The
medallions
were
pure
gold,
massive
and
ornate,
each
one
as
large
as
a
man’s
hand.
He
shouted
a
command.
Cook
slaves
pulled
a
heavy
iron
stew
pot
from
the
firepit,
dumped
the
stew
onto
the
ground,
and
returned
the
pot
to
the
flames.
Drogo
tossed
in
the
belt
and
watched
without
expression
as
the
medallions
turned
red
and
began
to
lose
their
shape.
She
could
see
fires
dancing
in
the
onyx
of
his
eyes.
A
slave
handed
him
a
pair
of
thick
horsehair
mittens,
and
he
pulled
them
on,
never
so
much
as
looking
at
the
man.

Viserys
began
to
scream
the
high,
wordless
scream
of
the
coward
facing
death.
He
kicked
and
twisted,
whimpered
like
a
dog
and
wept
like
a
child,
but
the
Dothraki
held
him
tight
between
them.
Ser
Jorah
had
made
his
way
to
Dany’s
side.
He
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder.
“Turn
away,
my
princess,
I
beg
you.”

“No.”
She
folded
her
arms
across
the
swell
of
her
belly,
protectively.

At
the
last,
Viserys
looked
at
her.
“Sister,
please…
Dany,
tell
them…
make
them…
sweet
sister…”

When
the
gold
was
half-melted
and
starting
to
run,
Drogo
reached
into
the
flames,
snatched
out
the
pot.
“Crown!”
he
roared.
“Here.
A
crown
for
Cart
King!”
And
upended
the
pot
over
the
head
of
the
man
who
had
been
her
brother.

The
sound
Viserys
Targaryen
made
when
that
hideous
iron
helmet
covered
his
face
was
like
nothing
human.
His
feet
hammered
a
frantic
beat
against
the
dirt
floor,
slowed,
stopped.
Thick
globs
of
molten
gold
dripped
down
onto
his
chest,
setting
the
scarlet
silk
to
smoldering…
yet
no
drop
of
blood
was
spilled.

He
was
no
dragon,
Dany
thought,
curiously
calm.
Fire
cannot
kill
a
dragon.





EDDARD

He
was
walking
through
the
crypts
beneath
Winterfell,
as
he
he
had
walked
a
thousand
times
before.
The
Kings
of
Winter
watched
him
pass
with
eyes
of
ice,
and
the
direwolves
at
their
feet
turned
their
great
stone
heads
and
snarled.
Last
of
all,
he
came
to
the
tomb
where
his
father
slept,
with
Brandon
and
Lyanna
beside
him.
“Promise
me,
Ned,”
Lyanna’s
statue
whispered.
She
wore
a
garland
of
pale
blue
roses,
and
her
eyes
wept
blood.

Eddard
Stark
jerked
upright,
his
heart
racing,
the
blankets
tangled
around
him.
The
room
was
black
as
pitch,
and
someone
was
hammering
on
the
door.
“Lord
Eddard,”
a
voice
called
loudly.

“A
moment.”
Groggy
and
naked,
he
stumbled
his
way
across
the
darkened
chamber.
When
he
opened
the
door,
he
found
Tomard
with
an
upraised
fist,
and
Cayn
with
a
taper
in
hand.
Between
them
stood
the
king’s
own
steward.

The
man’s
face
might
have
been
carved
of
stone,
so
little
did
it
show.
“My
lord
Hand,”
he
intoned.
“His
Grace
the
King
commands
your
presence.
At
once.”

So
Robert
had
returned
from
his
hunt.
It
was
long
past
time.
“I
shall
need
a
few
moments
to
dress.”
Ned
left
the
man
waiting
without.
Cayn
helped
him
with
his
clothes;
white
linen
tunic
and
grey
cloak,
trousers
cut
open
down
his
plaster-sheathed
leg,
his
badge
of
office,
and
last
of
all
a
belt
of
heavy
silver
links.
He
sheathed
the
Valyrian
dagger
at
his
waist.

The
Red
Keep
was
dark
and
still
as
Cayn
and
Tomard
escorted
him
across
the
inner
bailey.
The
moon
hung
low
over
the
walls,
ripening
toward
full.
On
the
ramparts,
a
guardsman
in
a
gold
cloak
walked
his
rounds.

The
royal
apartments
were
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
a
massive
square
fortress
that
nestled
in
the
heart
of
the
Red
Keep
behind
walls
twelve
feet
thick
and
a
dry
moat
lined
with
iron
spikes,
a
castle-within-a-castle.
Ser
Boros
Blount
guarded
the
far
end
of
the
bridge,
white
steel
armor
ghostly
in
the
moonlight.
Within,
Ned
passed
two
other
knights
of
the
Kingsguard;
Ser
Preston
Greenfield
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps,
and
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
waited
at
the
door
of
the
king’s
bedchamber.
Three
men
in
white
cloaks,
he
thought,
remembering,
and
a
strange
chill
went
through
him.
Ser
Barristan’s
face
was
as
pale
as
his
armor.
Ned
had
only
to
look
at
him
to
know
that
something
was
dreadfully
wrong.
The
royal
steward
opened
the
door.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark,
the
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
announced.

“Bring
him
here,”
Robert’s
voice
called,
strangely
thick.

Fires
blazed
in
the
twin
hearths
at
either
end
of
the
bedchamber,
filling
the
room
with
a
sullen
red
glare.
The
heat
within
was
suffocating.
Robert
lay
across
the
canopied
bed.
At
the
bedside
hovered
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
while
Lord
Renly
paced
restlessly
before
the
shuttered
windows.
Servants
moved
back
and
forth,
feeding
logs
to
the
fire
and
boiling
wine.
Cersei
Lannister
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
beside
her
husband.
Her
hair
was
tousled,
as
if
from
sleep,
but
there
was
nothing
sleepy
in
her
eyes.
They
followed
Ned
as
Tomard
and
Cayn
helped
him
cross
the
room.
He
seemed
to
move
very
slowly,
as
if
he
were
still
dreaming.

The
king
still
wore
his
boots.
Ned
could
see
dried
mud
and
blades
of
grass
clinging
to
the
leather
where
Robert’s
feet
stuck
out
beneath
the
blanket
that
covered
him,
A
green
doublet
lay
on
the
floor,
slashed
open
and
discarded,
the
cloth
crusted
with
red-brown
stains.
The
room
smelled
of
smoke
and
blood
and
death.

“Ned,”
the
king
whispered
when
he
saw
him.
His
face
was
pale
as
milk.
“Come…
closer.”

His
men
brought
him
close.
Ned
steadied
himself
with
a
hand
on
the
bedpost.
He
had
only
to
look
down
at
Robert
to
know
how
bad
it
was.
“What…?”
he
began,
his
throat
clenched.

“A
boar.”
Lord
Renly
was
still
in
his
hunting
greens,
his
cloak
spattered
with
blood.

“A
devil,”
the
king
husked.
“My
own
fault.
Too
much
wine,
damn
me
to
hell.
Missed
my
thrust.”

“And
where
were
the
rest
of
you?”
Ned
demanded
of
Lord
Renly.
“Where
was
Ser
Barristan
and
the
Kingsguard?”

Renly’s
mouth
twitched.
“My
brother
commanded
us
to
stand
aside
and
let
him
take
the
boar
alone.”

Eddard
Stark
lifted
the
blanket.

They
had
done
what
they
could
to
close
him
up,
but
it
was
nowhere
near
enough.
The
boar
must
have
been
a
fearsome
thing.
It
had
ripped
the
king
from
groin
to
nipple
with
its
tusks.
The
wine-soaked
bandages
that
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
applied
were
already
black
with
blood,
and
the
smell
off
the
wound
was
hideous.
Ned’s
stomach
turned.
He
let
the
blanket
fall.

“Stinks,”
Robert
said.
“The
stink
of
death,
don’t
think
I
can’t
smell
it.
Bastard
did
me
good,
eh?
But
I…
I
paid
him
back
in
kind,
Ned.”
The
king’s
smile
was
as
terrible
as
his
wound,
his
teeth
red.
“Drove
a
knife
right
through
his
eye.
Ask
them
if
I
didn’t.
Ask
them.”

“Truly,”
Lord
Renly
murmured.
“We
brought
the
carcass
back
with
us,
at
my
brother’s
command.”

“For
the
feast,”
Robert
whispered.
“Now
leave
us.
The
lot
of
you.
I
need
to
speak
with
Ned.”

“Robert,
my
sweet
lord…”
Cersei
began.

“I
said
leave,”
Robert
insisted
with
a
hint
of
his
old
fierceness.
“What
part
of
that
don’t
you
understand,
woman?”

Cersei
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
her
dignity
and
led
the
way
to
the
door.
Lord
Renly
and
the
others
followed.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lingered,
his
hands
shaking
as
he
offered
the
king
a
cup
of
thick
white
liquid.
“The
milk
of
the
poppy,
Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“Drink.
For
your
pain.”

Robert
knocked
the
cup
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Away
with
you.
I’ll
sleep
soon
enough,
old
fool.
Get
out.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
gave
Ned
a
stricken
look
as
he
shuffled
from
the
room.

“Damn
you,
Robert,”
Ned
said
when
they
were
alone.
His
leg
was
throbbing
so
badly
he
was
almost
blind
with
pain.
Or
perhaps
it
was
grief
that
fogged
his
eyes.
He
lowered
himself
to
the
bed,
beside
his
friend.
“Why
do
you
always
have
to
be
so
headstrong?”

“Ah,
fuck
you,
Ned,”
the
king
said
hoarsely.
“I
killed
the
bastard,
didn’t
I?”
A
lock
of
matted
black
hair
fell
across
his
eyes
as
he
glared
up
at
Ned.
“Ought
to
do
the
same
for
you.
Can’t
leave
a
man
to
hunt
in
peace.
Ser
Robar
found
me.
Gregor’s
head.
Ugly
thought.
Never
told
the
Hound.
Let
Cersei
surprise
him.”
His
laugh
turned
into
a
grunt
as
a
spasm
of
pain
hit
him.
“Gods
have
mercy,”
he
muttered,
swallowing
his
agony.
“The
girl.
Daenerys.
Only
a
child,
you
were
right…
that’s
why,
the
girl…
the
gods
sent
the
boar…
sent
to
punish
me…”
The
king
coughed,
bringing
up
blood.
“Wrong,
it
was
wrong,
I…
only
a
girl…
Varys,
Littlefinger,
even
my
brother…
worthless…
no
one
to
tell
me
no
but
you,
Ned…
only
you…”
He
lifted
his
hand,
the
gesture
pained
and
feeble.
“Paper
and
ink.
There,
on
the
table.
Write
what
I
tell
you.”

Ned
smoothed
the
paper
out
across
his
knee
and
took
up
the
quill.
“At
your
command,
Your
Grace.”

“This
is
the
will
and
word
of
Robert
of
House
Baratheon,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
all
the
rest—put
in
the
damn
titles,
you
know
how
it
goes.
I
do
hereby
command
Eddard
of
House
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Hand
of
the
King,
to
serve
as
Lord
Regent
and
Protector
of
the
Realm
upon
my…
upon
my
death…
to
rule
in
my…
in
my
stead,
until
my
son
Joffrey
does
come
of
age…”

“Robert…”
Joffrey
is
not
your
son,
he
wanted
to
say,
but
the
words
would
not
come.
The
agony
was
written
too
plainly
across
Robert’s
face;
he
could
not
hurt
him
more.
So
Ned
bent
his
head
and
wrote,
but
where
the
king
had
said
“my
son
Joffrey,”
he
scrawled
“my
heir”
instead.
The
deceit
made
him
feel
soiled.
The
lies
we
tell
for
love,
he
thought.
May
the
gods
forgive
me.
“What
else
would
you
have
me
say?”

“Say…
whatever
you
need
to.
Protect
and
defend,
gods
old
and
new,
you
have
the
words.
Write.
I’ll
sign
it.
You
give
it
to
the
council
when
I’m
dead.”

“Robert,”
Ned
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
grief,
“you
must
not
do
this.
Don’t
die
on
me.
The
realm
needs
you.”

Robert
took
his
hand,
fingers
squeezing
hard.
“You
are…
such
a
bad
liar,
Ned
Stark,”
he
said
through
his
pain.
“The
realm…
the
realm
knows…
what
a
wretched
king
I’ve
been.
Bad
as
Aerys,
the
gods
spare
me.”

“No,”
Ned
told
his
dying
friend,
“not
so
bad
as
Aerys,
Your
Grace.
Not
near
so
bad
as
Aerys.”

Robert
managed
a
weak
red
smile.
“At
the
least,
they
will
say…
this
last
thing…
this
I
did
right.
You
won’t
fail
me.
You’ll
rule
now.
You’ll
hate
it,
worse
than
I
did…
but
you’ll
do
well.
Are
you
done
with
the
scribbling?”

“Yes,
Your
Grace.”
Ned
offered
Robert
the
paper.
The
king
scrawled
his
signature
blindly,
leaving
a
smear
of
blood
across
the
letter.
“The
seal
should
be
witnessed.”

“Serve
the
boar
at
my
funeral
feast,”
Robert
rasped.
“Apple
in
its
mouth,
skin
seared
crisp.
Eat
the
bastard.
Don’t
care
if
you
choke
on
him.
Promise
me,
Ned.”

“I
promise.”
Promise
me,
Ned,
Lyanna’s
voice
echoed.

“The
girl,”
the
king
said.
“Daenerys.
Let
her
live.
If
you
can,
if
it…
not
too
late…
talk
to
them…
Varys,
Littlefinger…
don’t
let
them
kill
her.
And
help
my
son,
Ned.
Make
him
be…
better
than
me.”
He
winced.
“Gods
have
mercy.”

“They
will,
my
friend,”
Ned
said.
“They
will.”

The
king
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
relax.
“Killed
by
a
pig,”
he
muttered.
“Ought
to
laugh,
but
it
hurts
too
much.”

Ned
was
not
laughing.
“Shall
I
call
them
back?”

Robert
gave
a
weak
nod.
“As
you
will.
Gods,
why
is
it
so
cold
in
here?”

The
servants
rushed
back
in
and
hurried
to
feed
the
fires.
The
queen
had
gone;
that
was
some
small
relief,
at
least.
If
she
had
any
sense,
Cersei
would
take
her
children
and
fly
before
the
break
of
day,
Ned
thought.
She
had
lingered
too
long
already.

King
Robert
did
not
seem
to
miss
her.
He
bid
his
brother
Renly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
stand
in
witness
as
he
pressed
his
seal
into
the
hot
yellow
wax
that
Ned
had
dripped
upon
his
letter.
“Now
give
me
something
for
the
pain
and
let
me
die.”

Hurriedly
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
mixed
him
another
draught
of
the
milk
of
the
poppy.
This
time
the
king
drank
deeply.
His
black
beard
was
beaded
with
thick
white
droplets
when
he
threw
the
empty
cup
aside.
“Will
I
dream?”

Ned
gave
him
his
answer.
“You
will,
my
lord.”

“Good,”
he
said,
smiling.
“I
will
give
Lyanna
your
love,
Ned.
Take
care
of
my
children
for
me.”

The
words
twisted
in
Ned’s
belly
like
a
knife.
For
a
moment
he
was
at
a
loss.
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
lie.
Then
he
remembered
the
bastards:
little
Barra
at
her
mother’s
breast,
Mya
in
the
Vale,
Gendry
at
his
forge,
and
all
the
others.
“I
shall…
guard
your
children
as
if
they
were
my
own,”
he
said
slowly.

Robert
nodded
and
closed
his
eyes.
Ned
watched
his
old
friend
sag
softly
into
the
pillows
as
the
milk
of
the
poppy
washed
the
pain
from
his
face.
Sleep
took
him.

Heavy
chains
jangled
softly
as
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
up
to
Ned.
“I
will
do
all
in
my
power,
my
lord,
but
the
wound
has
mortified.
It
took
them
two
days
to
get
him
back.
By
the
time
I
saw
him,
it
was
too
late.
I
can
lessen
His
Grace’s
suffering,
but
only
the
gods
can
heal
him
now.”

“How
long?”
Ned
asked.

“By
rights,
he
should
be
dead
already.
I
have
never
seen
a
man
cling
to
life
so
fiercely.”

“My
brother
was
always
strong,”
Lord
Renly
said.
“Not
wise,
perhaps,
but
strong.”
In
the
sweltering
heat
of
the
bedchamber,
his
brow
was
slick
with
sweat.
He
might
have
been
Robert’s
ghost
as
he
stood
there,
young
and
dark
and
handsome.
“He
slew
the
boar.
His
entrails
were
sliding
from
his
belly,
yet
somehow
he
slew
the
boar.”
His
voice
was
full
of
wonder.

“Robert
was
never
a
man
to
leave
the
battleground
so
long
as
a
foe
remained
standing,”
Ned
told
him.

Outside
the
door,
Ser
Barristan
Selmy
still
guarded
the
tower
stairs.
“Maester
Pycelle
has
given
Robert
the
milk
of
the
poppy,”
Ned
told
him.
“See
that
no
one
disturbs
his
rest
without
leave
from
me.”

“It
shall
be
as
you
command,
my
lord.”
Ser
Barristan
seemed
old
beyond
his
years.
“I
have
failed
my
sacred
trust.”

“Even
the
truest
knight
cannot
protect
a
king
against
himself,”
Ned
said.
“Robert
loved
to
hunt
boar.
I
have
seen
him
take
a
thousand
of
them.”
He
would
stand
his
ground
without
flinching,
his
legs
braced,
the
great
spear
in
his
hands,
and
as
often
as
not
he
would
curse
the
boar
as
it
charged,
and
wait
until
the
last
possible
second,
until
it
was
almost
on
him,
before
he
killed
it
with
a
single
sure
and
savage
thrust.
“No
one
could
know
this
one
would
be
his
death.”

“You
are
kind
to
say
so,
Lord
Eddard.”

“The
king
himself
said
as
much.
He
blamed
the
wine.”

The
white-haired
knight
gave
a
weary
nod.
“His
Grace
was
reeling
in
his
saddle
by
the
time
we
flushed
the
boar
from
his
lair,
yet
he
commanded
us
all
to
stand
aside.”

“I
wonder,
Ser
Barristan,”
asked
Varys,
so
quietly,
“who
gave
the
king
this
wine?”

Ned
had
not
heard
the
eunuch
approach,
but
when
he
looked
around,
there
he
stood.
He
wore
a
black
velvet
robe
that
brushed
the
floor,
and
his
face
was
freshly
powdered.

“The
wine
was
from
the
king’s
own
skin,”
Ser
Barristan
said.

“Only
one
skin?
Hunting
is
such
thirsty
work.”

“I
did
not
keep
count.
More
than
one,
for
a
certainty.
His
squire
would
fetch
him
a
fresh
skin
whenever
he
required
it.”

“Such
a
dutiful
boy,”
said
Varys,
“to
make
certain
His
Grace
did
not
lack
for
refreshment.”

Ned
had
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth.
He
recalled
the
two
fair-haired
boys
Robert
had
sent
chasing
after
a
breastplate
stretcher.
The
king
had
told
everyone
the
tale
that
night
at
the
feast,
laughing
until
he
shook.
“Which
squire?”

“The
elder,”
said
Ser
Barristan.
“Lancel.”

“I
know
the
lad
well,”
said
Varys.
“A
stalwart
boy,
Ser
Kevan
Lannister’s
son,
nephew
to
Lord
Tywin
and
cousin
to
the
queen.
I
hope
the
dear
sweet
lad
does
not
blame
himself.
Children
are
so
vulnerable
in
the
innocence
of
their
youth,
how
well
do
I
remember.”

Certainly
Varys
had
once
been
young.
Ned
doubted
that
he
had
ever
been
innocent.
“You
mention
children.
Robert
had
a
change
of
heart
concerning
Daenerys
Targaryen.
Whatever
arrangements
you
made,
I
want
unmade.
At
once.”

“Alas,”
said
Varys.
“At
once
may
be
too
late.
I
fear
those
birds
have
flown.
But
I
shall
do
what
I
can,
my
lord.
With
your
leave.”
He
bowed
and
vanished
down
the
steps,
his
soft-soled
slippers
whispering
against
the
stone
as
he
made
his
descent.

Cayn
and
Tomard
were
helping
Ned
across
the
bridge
when
Lord
Renly
emerged
from
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
“Lord
Eddard,”
he
called
after
Ned,
“a
moment,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

Ned
stopped.
“As
you
wish.”

Renly
walked
to
his
side.
“Send
your
men
away.”
They
met
in
the
center
of
the
bridge,
the
dry
moat
beneath
them.
Moonlight
silvered
the
cruel
edges
of
the
spikes
that
lined
its
bed.

Ned
gestured.
Tomard
and
Cayn
bowed
their
heads
and
backed
away
respectfully.
Lord
Renly
glanced
warily
at
Ser
Boros
on
the
far
end
of
the
span,
at
Ser
Preston
in
the
doorway
behind
them.
“That
letter.”
He
leaned
close.
“Was
it
the
regency?
Has
my
brother
named
you
Protector?”
He
did
not
wait
for
a
reply.
“My
lord,
I
have
thirty
men
in
my
personal
guard,
and
other
friends
beside,
knights
and
lords.
Give
me
an
hour,
and
I
can
put
a
hundred
swords
in
your
hand.”

“And
what
should
I
do
with
a
hundred
swords,
my
lord?”

“Strike!
Now,
while
the
castle
sleeps.”
Renly
looked
back
at
Ser
Boros
again
and
dropped
his
voice
to
an
urgent
whisper.
“We
must
get
Joffrey
away
from
his
mother
and
take
him
in
hand.
Protector
or
no,
the
man
who
holds
the
king
holds
the
kingdom.
We
should
seize
Myrcella
and
Tommen
as
well.
Once
we
have
her
children,
Cersei
will
not
dare
oppose
us.
The
council
will
confirm
you
as
Lord
Protector
and
make
Joffrey
your
ward.”

Ned
regarded
him
coldly.
“Robert
is
not
dead
yet.
The
gods
may
spare
him.
If
not,
I
shall
convene
the
council
to
hear
his
final
words
and
consider
the
matter
of
the
succession,
but
I
will
not
dishonor
his
last
hours
on
earth
by
shedding
blood
in
his
halls
and
dragging
frightened
children
from
their
beds.”

Lord
Renly
took
a
step
back,
taut
as
a
bowstring.
“Every
moment
you
delay
gives
Cersei
another
moment
to
prepare.
By
the
time
Robert
dies,
it
may
be
too
late…
for
both
of
us.”

“Then
we
should
pray
that
Robert
does
not
die.”

“Small
chance
of
that,”
said
Renly.

“Sometimes
the
gods
are
merciful.”

“The
Lannisters
are
not.”
Lord
Renly
turned
away
and
went
back
across
the
moat,
to
the
tower
where
his
brother
lay
dying.

By
the
time
Ned
returned
to
his
chambers,
he
felt
weary
and
heartsick,
yet
there
was
no
question
of
his
going
back
to
sleep,
not
now.
When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die,
Cersei
Lannister
had
told
him
in
the
godswood.
He
found
himself
wondering
if
he
had
done
the
right
thing
by
refusing
Lord
Renly’s
offer.
He
had
no
taste
for
these
intrigues,
and
there
was
no
honor
in
threatening
children,
and
yet…
if
Cersei
elected
to
fight
rather
than
flee,
he
might
well
have
need
of
Renly’s
hundred
swords,
and
more
besides.

“I
want
Littlefinger,”
he
told
Cayn.
“If
he’s
not
in
his
chambers,
take
as
many
men
as
you
need
and
search
every
winesink
and
whorehouse
in
King’s
Landing
until
you
find
him.
Bring
him
to
me
before
break
of
day.”
Cayn
bowed
and
took
his
leave,
and
Ned
turned
to
Tomard.
“The
Wind
Witch
sails
on
the
evening
tide.
Have
you
chosen
the
escort?”

“Ten
men,
with
Porther
in
command.”

“Twenty,
and
you
will
command,”
Ned
said.
Porther
was
a
brave
man,
but
headstrong.
He
wanted
someone
more
solid
and
sensible
to
keep
watch
over
his
daughters.

“As
you
wish,
m’lord,”
Tom
said.
“Can’t
say
I’ll
be
sad
to
see
the
back
of
this
place.
I
miss
the
wife.”

“You
will
pass
near
Dragonstone
when
you
turn
north.
I
need
you
to
deliver
a
letter
for
me.”

Tom
looked
apprehensive.
“To
Dragonstone,
m’lord?”
The
island
fortress
of
House
Targaryen
had
a
sinister
repute.

“Tell
Captain
Qos
to
hoist
my
banner
as
soon
as
he
comes
in
sight
of
the
island.
They
may
be
wary
of
unexpected
visitors.
If
he
is
reluctant,
offer
him
whatever
it
takes.
I
will
give
you
a
letter
to
place
into
the
hand
of
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon.
No
one
else.
Not
his
steward,
nor
the
captain
of
his
guard,
nor
his
lady
wife,
but
only
Lord
Stannis
himself.”

“As
you
command,
m’lord.”

When
Tomard
had
left
him,
Lord
Eddard
Stark
sat
staring
at
the
flame
of
the
candle
that
burned
beside
him
on
the
table.
For
a
moment
his
grief
overwhelmed
him.
He
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
seek
out
the
godswood,
to
kneel
before
the
heart
tree
and
pray
for
the
life
of
Robert
Baratheon,
who
had
been
more
than
a
brother
to
him.
Men
would
whisper
afterward
that
Eddard
Stark
had
betrayed
his
king’s
friendship
and
disinherited
his
sons;
he
could
only
hope
that
the
gods
would
know
better,
and
that
Robert
would
learn
the
truth
of
it
in
the
land
beyond
the
grave.

Ned
took
out
the
king’s
last
letter.
A
roll
of
crisp
white
parchment
sealed
with
golden
wax,
a
few
short
words
and
a
smear
of
blood.
How
small
the
difference
between
victory
and
defeat,
between
life
and
death.

He
drew
out
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
and
dipped
his
quill
in
the
inkpot.
To
His
Grace,
Stannis
of
the
House
Baratheon,
he
wrote.
By
the
time
you
receive
this
letter,
your
brother
Robert,
our
King
these
past
fifteen
years,
will
be
dead.
He
was
savaged
by
a
boar
whilst
hunting
in
the
kingswood…

The
letters
seemed
to
writhe
and
twist
on
the
paper
as
his
hand
trailed
to
a
stop.
Lord
Tywin
and
Ser
Jaime
were
not
men
to
suffer
disgrace
meekly;
they
would
fight
rather
than
flee.
No
doubt
Lord
Stannis
was
wary,
after
the
murder
of
Jon
Arryn,
but
it
was
imperative
that
he
sail
for
King’s
Landing
at
once
with
all
his
power,
before
the
Lannisters
could
march.

Ned
chose
each
word
with
care.
When
he
was
done,
he
signed
the
letter
Eddard
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell,
Hand
of
the
King,
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,
blotted
the
paper,
folded
it
twice,
and
melted
the
sealing
wax
over
the
candle
flame.

His
regency
would
be
a
short
one,
he
reflected
as
the
wax
softened.
The
new
king
would
choose
his
own
Hand.
Ned
would
be
free
to
go
home.
The
thought
of
Winterfell
brought
a
wan
smile
to
his
face.
He
wanted
to
hear
Bran’s
laughter
once
more,
to
go
hawking
with
Robb,
to
watch
Rickon
at
play.
He
wanted
to
drift
off
to
a
dreamless
sleep
in
his
own
bed
with
his
arms
wrapped
tight
around
his
lady,
Catelyn.

Cayn
returned
as
he
was
pressing
the
direwolf
seal
down
into
the
soft
white
wax.
Desmond
was
with
him,
and
between
them
Littlefinger.
Ned
thanked
his
guards
and
sent
them
away.

Lord
Petyr
was
clad
in
a
blue
velvet
tunic
with
puffed
sleeves,
his
silvery
cape
patterned
with
mockingbirds.
“I
suppose
congratulations
are
in
order,”
he
said
as
he
seated
himself.

Ned
scowled.
“The
king
lies
wounded
and
near
to
death.”

“I
know,”
Littlefinger
said.
“I
also
know
that
Robert
has
named
you
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

Ned’s
eyes
flicked
to
the
king’s
letter
on
the
table
beside
him,
its
seal
unbroken.
“And
how
is
it
you
know
that,
my
lord?”

“Varys
hinted
as
much,”
Littlefinger
said,
“and
you
have
just
confirmed
it.”

Ned’s
mouth
twisted
in
anger.
“Damn
Varys
and
his
little
birds.
Catelyn
spoke
truly,
the
man
has
some
black
art.
I
do
not
trust
him.”

“Excellent.
You’re
learning.”
Littlefinger
leaned
forward.
“Yet
I’ll
wager
you
did
not
drag
me
here
in
the
black
of
night
to
discuss
the
eunuch.”

“No,”
Ned
admitted.
“I
know
the
secret
Jon
Arryn
was
murdered
to
protect.
Robert
will
leave
no
trueborn
son
behind
him.
Joffrey
and
Tommen
are
Jaime
Lannister’s
bastards,
born
of
his
incestuous
union
with
the
queen.”

Littlefinger
lifted
an
eyebrow.
“Shocking,”
he
said
in
a
tone
that
suggested
he
was
not
shocked
at
all.
“The
girl
as
well?
No
doubt.
So
when
the
king
dies…”

“The
throne
by
rights
passes
to
Lord
Stannis,
the
elder
of
Robert’s
two
brothers.”

Lord
Petyr
stroked
his
pointed
beard
as
he
considered
the
matter.
“So
it
would
seem.
Unless…”

“Unless,
my
lord?
There
is
no
seeming
to
this.
Stannis
is
the
heir.
Nothing
can
change
that.”

“Stannis
cannot
take
the
throne
without
your
help.
If
you’re
wise,
you’ll
make
certain
Joffrey
succeeds.”

Ned
gave
him
a
stony
stare.
“Have
you
no
shred
of
honor?”

“Oh,
a
shred,
surely,”
Littlefinger
replied
negligently.
“Hear
me
out.
Stannis
is
no
friend
of
yours,
nor
of
mine.
Even
his
brothers
can
scarcely
stomach
him.
The
man
is
iron,
hard
and
unyielding.
He’ll
give
us
a
new
Hand
and
a
new
council,
for
a
certainty.
No
doubt
he’ll
thank
you
for
handing
him
the
crown,
but
he
won’t
love
you
for
it.
And
his
ascent
will
mean
war.
Stannis
cannot
rest
easy
on
the
throne
until
Cersei
and
her
bastards
are
dead.
Do
you
think
Lord
Tywin
will
sit
idly
while
his
daughter’s
head
is
measured
for
a
spike?
Casterly
Rock
will
rise,
and
not
alone.
Robert
found
it
in
him
to
pardon
men
who
served
King
Aerys,
so
long
as
they
did
him
fealty.
Stannis
is
less
forgiving.
He
will
not
have
forgotten
the
siege
of
Storm’s
End,
and
the
Lords
Tyrell
and
Redwyne
dare
not.
Every
man
who
fought
beneath
the
dragon
banner
or
rose
with
Balon
Greyjoy
will
have
good
cause
to
fear.
Seat
Stannis
on
the
Iron
Throne
and
I
promise
you,
the
realm
will
bleed.

“Now
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
Joffrey
is
but
twelve,
and
Robert
gave
you
the
regency,
my
lord.
You
are
the
Hand
of
the
King
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.
The
power
is
yours,
Lord
Stark.
All
you
need
do
is
reach
out
and
take
it.
Make
your
peace
with
the
Lannisters.
Release
the
Imp.
Wed
Joffrey
to
your
Sansa.
Wed
your
younger
girl
to
Prince
Tommen,
and
your
heir
to
Myrcella.
It
will
be
four
years
before
Joffrey
comes
of
age.
By
then
he
will
look
to
you
as
a
second
father,
and
if
not,
well…
four
years
is
a
good
long
while,
my
lord.
Long
enough
to
dispose
of
Lord
Stannis.
Then,
should
Joffrey
prove
troublesome,
we
can
reveal
his
little
secret
and
put
Lord
Renly
on
the
throne.”

“We?”
Ned
repeated.

Littlefinger
gave
a
shrug.
“You’ll
need
someone
to
share
your
burdens.
I
assure
you,
my
price
would
be
modest.”

“Your
price.”
Ned’s
voice
was
ice.
“Lord
Baelish,
what
you
suggest
is
treason.”

“Only
if
we
lose.”

“You
forget,”
Ned
told
him.
“You
forget
Jon
Arryn.
You
forget
Jory
Cassel.
And
you
forget
this.”
He
drew
the
dagger
and
laid
it
on
the
table
between
them;
a
length
of
dragonbone
and
Valyrian
steel,
as
sharp
as
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong,
between
true
and
false,
between
life
and
death.
“They
sent
a
man
to
cut
my
son’s
throat,
Lord
Baelish.”

Littlefinger
sighed.
“I
fear
I
did
forget,
my
lord.
Pray
forgive
me.
For
a
moment
I
did
not
remember
that
I
was
talking
to
a
Stark.”
His
mouth
quirked.
“So
it
will
be
Stannis,
and
war?”

“It
is
not
a
choice.
Stannis
is
the
heir.”

“Far
be
it
from
me
to
dispute
the
Lord
Protector.
What
would
you
have
of
me,
then?
Not
my
wisdom,
for
a
certainty.”

“I
shall
do
my
best
to
forget
your…
wisdom,”
Ned
said
with
distaste.
“I
called
you
here
to
ask
for
the
help
you
promised
Catelyn.
This
is
a
perilous
hour
for
all
of
us.
Robert
has
named
me
Protector,
true
enough,
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
world,
Joffrey
is
still
his
son
and
heir.
The
queen
has
a
dozen
knights
and
a
hundred
men-at-arms
who
will
do
whatever
she
commands…
enough
to
overwhelm
what
remains
of
my
own
household
guard.
And
for
all
I
know,
her
brother
Jaime
may
be
riding
for
King’s
Landing
even
as
we
speak,
with
a
Lannister
host
at
his
back.”

“And
you
without
an
army.”
Littlefinger
toyed
with
the
dagger
on
the
table,
turning
it
slowly
with
a
finger.
“There
is
small
love
lost
between
Lord
Renly
and
the
Lannisters.
Bronze
Yohn
Royce,
Ser
Balon
Swann,
Ser
Loras,
Lady
Tanda,
the
Redwyne
twins…
each
of
them
has
a
retinue
of
knights
and
sworn
swords
here
at
court.”

“Renly
has
thirty
men
in
his
personal
guard,
the
rest
even
fewer.
It
is
not
enough,
even
if
I
could
be
certain
that
all
of
them
will
choose
to
give
me
their
allegiance.
I
must
have
the
gold
cloaks.
The
City
Watch
is
two
thousand
strong,
sworn
to
defend
the
castle,
the
city,
and
the
king’s
peace.”

“Ah,
but
when
the
queen
proclaims
one
king
and
the
Hand
another,
whose
peace
do
they
protect?”
Lord
Petyr
flicked
at
the
dagger
with
his
finger,
setting
it
spinning
in
place.
Round
and
round
it
went,
wobbling
as
it
turned.
When
at
last
it
slowed
to
a
stop,
the
blade
pointed
at
Littlefinger.
“Why,
there’s
your
answer,”
he
said,
smiling.
“They
follow
the
man
who
pays
them.”
He
leaned
back
and
looked
Ned
full
in
the
face,
his
grey-green
eyes
bright
with
mockery.
“You
wear
your
honor
like
a
suit
of
armor,
Stark.
You
think
it
keeps
you
safe,
but
all
it
does
is
weigh
you
down
and
make
it
hard
for
you
to
move.
Look
at
you
now.
You
know
why
you
summoned
me
here.
You
know
what
you
want
to
ask
me
to
do.
You
know
it
has
to
be
done…
but
it’s
not
honorable,
so
the
words
stick
in
your
throat.”

Ned’s
neck
was
rigid
with
tension.
For
a
moment
he
was
so
angry
that
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak.

Littlefinger
laughed.
“I
ought
to
make
you
say
it,
but
that
would
be
cruel…
so
have
no
fear,
my
good
lord.
For
the
sake
of
the
love
I
bear
for
Catelyn,
I
will
go
to
Janos
Slynt
this
very
hour
and
make
certain
that
the
City
Watch
is
yours.
Six
thousand
gold
pieces
should
do
it.
A
third
for
the
Commander,
a
third
for
the
officers,
a
third
for
the
men.
We
might
be
able
to
buy
them
for
half
that
much,
but
I
prefer
not
to
take
chances.”
Smiling,
he
plucked
up
the
dagger
and
offered
it
to
Ned,
hilt
first.





JON

Jon
was
breaking
his
fast
on
applecakes
and
blood
sausage
when
Samwell
Tarly
plopped
himself
down
on
the
bench.
“I’ve
been
summoned
to
the
sept,”
Sam
said
in
an
excited
whisper.
“They’re
passing
me
out
of
training.
I’m
to
be
made
a
brother
with
the
rest
of
you.
Can
you
believe
it?”

“No,
truly?”

“Truly.
I’m
to
assist
Maester
Aemon
with
the
library
and
the
birds.
He
needs
someone
who
can
read
and
write
letters.”

“You’ll
do
well
at
that,”
Jon
said,
smiling.

Sam
glanced
about
anxiously.
“Is
it
time
to
go?
I
shouldn’t
be
late,
they
might
change
their
minds.”
He
was
fairly
bouncing
as
they
crossed
the
weed-strewn
courtyard.
The
day
was
warm
and
sunny.
Rivulets
of
water
trickled
down
the
sides
of
the
Wall,
so
the
ice
seemed
to
sparkle
and
shine.

Inside
the
sept,
the
great
crystal
caught
the
morning
light
as
it
streamed
through
the
south-facing
window
and
spread
it
in
a
rainbow
on
the
altar.
Pyp’s
mouth
dropped
open
when
he
caught
sight
of
Sam,
and
Toad
poked
Grenn
in
the
ribs,
but
no
one
dared
say
a
word.
Septon
Celladar
was
swinging
a
censer,
filling
the
air
with
fragrant
incense
that
reminded
Jon
of
Lady
Stark’s
little
sept
in
Winterfell.
For
once
the
septon
seemed
sober.

The
high
officers
arrived
in
a
body;
Maester
Aemon
leaning
on
Clydas,
Ser
Alliser
cold-eyed
and
grim,
Lord
Commander
Mormont
resplendent
in
a
black
wool
doublet
with
silvered
bearclaw
fastenings.
Behind
them
came
the
senior
members
of
the
three
orders:
red-faced
Bowen
Marsh
the
Lord
Steward,
First
Builder
Othell
Yarwyck,
and
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
who
commanded
the
rangers
in
the
absence
of
Benjen
Stark.

Mormont
stood
before
the
altar,
the
rainbow
shining
on
his
broad
bald
head.
“You
came
to
us
outlaws,”
he
began,
“poachers,
rapers,
debtors,
killers,
and
thieves.
You
came
to
us
children.
You
came
to
us
alone,
in
chains,
with
neither
friends
nor
honor.
You
came
to
us
rich,
and
you
came
to
us
poor.
Some
of
you
bear
the
names
of
proud
houses.
Others
have
only
bastards’
names,
or
no
names
at
all.
It
makes
no
matter.
All
that
is
past
now.
On
the
Wall,
we
are
all
one
house.

“At
evenfall,
as
the
sun
sets
and
we
face
the
gathering
night,
you
shall
take
your
vows.
From
that
moment,
you
will
be
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch.
Your
crimes
will
be
washed
away,
your
debts
forgiven.
So
too
you
must
wash
away
your
former
loyalties,
put
aside
your
grudges,
forget
old
wrongs
and
old
loves
alike.
Here
you
begin
anew.

“A
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
lives
his
life
for
the
realm.
Not
for
a
king,
nor
a
lord,
nor
the
honor
of
this
house
or
that
house,
neither
for
gold
nor
glory
nor
a
woman’s
love,
but
for
the
realm,
and
all
the
people
in
it.
A
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch
takes
no
wife
and
fathers
no
sons.
Our
wife
is
duty.
Our
mistress
is
honor.
And
you
are
the
only
sons
we
shall
ever
know.

“You
have
learned
the
words
of
the
vow.
Think
carefully
before
you
say
them,
for
once
you
have
taken
the
black,
there
is
no
turning
back.
The
penalty
for
desertion
is
death.”
The
Old
Bear
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
said,
“Are
there
any
among
you
who
wish
to
leave
our
company?
If
so,
go
now,
and
no
one
shall
think
the
less
of
you.”

No
one
moved.

“Well
and
good,”
said
Mormont.
“You
may
take
your
vows
here
at
evenfall,
before
Septon
Celladar
and
the
first
of
your
order.
Do
any
of
you
keep
to
the
old
gods?”

Jon
stood.
“I
do,
my
lord.”

“I
expect
you
will
want
to
say
your
words
before
a
heart
tree,
as
your
uncle
did,”
Mormont
said.

“Yes,
my
lord,”
Jon
said.
The
gods
of
the
sept
had
nothing
to
do
with
him;
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
flowed
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks.

He
heard
Grenn
whispering
behind
him.
“There’s
no
godswood
here.
Is
there?
I
never
saw
a
godswood.”

“You
wouldn’t
see
a
herd
of
aurochs
until
they
trampled
you
into
the
snow,”
Pyp
whispered
back.

“I
would
so,”
Grenn
insisted.
“I’d
see
them
a
long
way
off.”

Mormont
himself
confirmed
Grenn’s
doubts.
“Castle
Black
has
no
need
of
a
godswood.
Beyond
the
Wall
the
haunted
forest
stands
as
it
stood
in
the
Dawn
Age,
long
before
the
Andals
brought
the
Seven
across
the
narrow
sea.
You
will
find
a
grove
of
weirwoods
half
a
league
from
this
spot,
and
mayhap
your
gods
as
well.”

“My
lord.”
The
voice
made
Jon
glance
back
in
surprise.
Samwell
Tarly
was
on
his
feet.
The
fat
boy
wiped
his
sweaty
palms
against
his
tunic.
“Might
I…
might
I
go
as
well?
To
say
my
words
at
this
heart
tree?”

“Does
House
Tarly
keep
the
old
gods
too?”
Mormont
asked.

“No,
my
lord,”
Sam
replied
in
a
thin,
nervous
voice.
The
high
officers
frightened
him,
Jon
knew,
the
Old
Bear
most
of
all.
“I
was
named
in
the
light
of
the
Seven
at
the
sept
on
Horn
Hill,
as
my
father
was,
and
his
father,
and
all
the
Tarlys
for
a
thousand
years.”

“Why
would
you
forsake
the
gods
of
your
father
and
your
House?”
wondered
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker.

“The
Night’s
Watch
is
my
House
now,”
Sam
said.
“The
Seven
have
never
answered
my
prayers.
Perhaps
the
old
gods
will.”

“As
you
wish,
boy,”
Mormont
said.
Sam
took
his
seat
again,
as
did
Jon.
“We
have
placed
each
of
you
in
an
order,
as
befits
our
need
and
your
own
strengths
and
skills.”
Bowen
Marsh
stepped
forward
and
handed
him
a
paper.
The
Lord
Commander
unrolled
it
and
began
to
read.
“Haider,
to
the
builders,”
he
began.
Haider
gave
a
stiff
nod
of
approval.
“Grenn,
to
the
rangers.
Albett,
to
the
builders.
Pypar,
to
the
rangers.”
Pyp
looked
over
at
Jon
and
wiggled
his
ears.
“Samwell,
to
the
stewards.”
Sam
sagged
with
relief,
mopping
at
his
brow
with,a
scrap
of
silk.
“Matthar,
to
the
rangers.
Dareon,
to
the
stewards.
Todder,
to
the
rangers.
Jon,
to
the
stewards.”

The
stewards?
For
a
moment
Jon
could
not
believe
what
he
had
heard.
Mormont
must
have
read
it
wrong.
He
started
to
rise,
to
open
his
mouth,
to
tell
them
there
had
been
a
mistake…
and
then
he
saw
Ser
Alliser
studying
him,
eyes
shiny
as
two
flakes
of
obsidian,
and
he
knew.

The
Old
Bear
rolled
up
the
paper.
“Your
firsts
will
instruct
you
in
your
duties.
May
all
the
gods
preserve
you,
brothers.”
The
Lord
Commander
favored
them
with
a
half
bow,
and
took
his
leave.
Ser
Alliser
went
with
him,
a
thin
smile
on
his
face.
Jon
had
never
seen
the
master-at-arms
took
quite
so
happy.

“Rangers
with
me,”
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
called
when
they
were
gone.
Pyp
was
staring
at
Jon
as
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet.
His
ears
were
red.
Grenn,
grinning
broadly,
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
anything
was
amiss.
Matt
and
Toad
fell
in
beside
them,
and
they
followed
Ser
Jaremy
from
the
sept.

“Builders,”
announced
lantern-jawed
Othell
Yarwyck.
Haider
and
Albett
trailed
out
after
him.

Jon
looked
around
him
in
sick
disbelief.
Maester
Aemon’s
blind
eyes
were
raised
toward
the
light
he
could
not
see.
The
septon
was
arranging
crystals
on
the
altar.
Only
Sam
and
Darcon
remained
on
the
benches;
a
fat
boy,
a
singer…
and
him.

Lord
Steward
Bowen
Marsh
rubbed
his
plump
hands
together.
“Samwell,
you
will
assist
Maester
Aemon
in
the
rookery
and
library.
Chett
is
going
to
the
kennels,
to
help
with
the
hounds.
You
shall
have
his
cell,
so
as
to
be
close
to
the
maester
night
and
day.
I
trust
you
will
take
good
care
of
him.
He
is
very
old
and
very
precious
to
us.

“Dareon,
I
am
told
that
you
sang
at
many
a
high
lord’s
table
and
shared
their
meat
and
mead.
We
are
sending
you
to
Eastwatch.
It
may
be
your
palate
will
be
some
help
to
Cotter
Pyke
when
merchant
galleys
come
trading.
We
are
paying
too
dear
for
salt
beef
and
pickled
fish,
and
the
quality
of
the
olive
oil
we’re
getting
has
been
frightful,
Present
yourself
to
Borcas
when
you
arrive,
he
will
keep
you
busy
between
ships.”

Marsh
turned
his
smile
on
Jon.
“Lord
Commander
Mormont
has
requested
you
for
his
personal
steward,
Jon.
You’ll
sleep
in
a
cell
beneath
his
chambers,
in
the
Lord
Commander’s
tower.”

“And
what
will
my
duties
be?”
Jon
asked
sharply.
“Will
I
serve
the
Lord
Commander’s
meals,
help
him
fasten
his
clothes,
fetch
hot
water
for
his
bath?”

“Certainly.”
Marsh
frowned
at
Jon’s
tone.
“And
you
will
run
his
messages,
keep
a
fire
burning
in
his
chambers,
change
his
sheets
and
blankets
daily,
and
do
all
else
that
the
Lord
Commander
might
require
of
you.”

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
servant?”

“No,”
Maester
Aemon
said,
from
the
back
of
the
sept.
Clydas
helped
him
stand.
“We
took
you
for
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch…
but
perhaps
we
were
wrong
in
that.”

It
was
all
Jon
could
do
to
stop
himself
from
walking
out.
Was
he
supposed
to
churn
butter
and
sew
doublets
like
a
girl
for
the
rest
of
his
days?
“May
I
go?”
he
asked
stiffly.

“As
you
wish,”
Bowen
Marsh
responded.

Dareon
and
Sam
left
with
him.
They
descended
to
the
yard
in
silence.
Outside,
Jon
looked
up
at
the
Wall
shining
in
the
sun,
the
melting
ice
creeping
down
its
side
in
a
hundred
thin
fingers.
Jon’s
rage
was
such
that
he
would
have
smashed
it
all
in
an
instant,
and
the
world
be
damned.

“Jon,”
Samwell
Tarly
said
excitedly.
“Wait.
Don’t
you
see
what
they’re
doing?”

Jon
turned
on
him
in
a
fury.
“I
see
Ser
Alliser’s
bloody
hand,
that’s
all
I
see.
He
wanted
to
shame
me,
and
he
has.”

Dareon
gave
him
a
look.
“The
stewards
are
fine
for
the
likes
of
you
and
me,
Sam,
but
not
for
Lord
Snow.”

“I’m
a
better
swordsman
and
a
better
rider
than
any
of
you,”
Jon
blazed
back.
“It’s
not
fair!”

“Fair?”
Dareon
sneered.
“The
girl
was
waiting
for
me,
naked
as
the
day
she
was
born.
She
pulled
me
through
the
window,
and
you
talk
to
me
of
fair?”
He
walked
off.

“There
is
no
shame
in
being
a
steward,”
Sam
said.

“Do
you
think
I
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
washing
an
old
man’s
smallclothes?”

“The
old
man
is
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch,”
Sam
reminded
him.
“You’ll
be
with
him
day
and
night.
Yes,
you’ll
pour
his
wine
and
see
that
his
bed
linen
is
fresh,
but
you’ll
also
take
his
letters,
attend
him
at
meetings,
squire
for
him
in
battle.
You’ll
be
as
close
to
him
as
his
shadow.
You’ll
know
everything,
be
a
part
of
everything…
and
the
Lord
Steward
said
Mormont
asked
for
you
himself!

“When
I
was
little,
my
father
used
to
insist
that
I
attend
him
in
the
audience
chamber
whenever
he
held
court.
When
he
rode
to
Highgarden
to
bend
his
knee
to
Lord
Tyrell,
he
made
me
come.
Later,
though,
he
started
to
take
Dickon
and
leave
me
at
home,
and
he
no
longer
cared
whether
I
sat
through
his
audiences,
so
long
as
Dickon
was
there.
He
wanted
his
heir
at
his
side,
don’t
you
see?
To
watch
and
listen
and
learn
from
all
he
did.
I’ll
wager
that’s
why
Lord
Mormont
requested
you,
Jon.
What
else
could
it
be?
He
wants
to
groom
you
for
command!”

Jon
was
taken
aback.
It
was
true,
Lord
Eddard
had
often
made
Robb
part
of
his
councils
back
at
Winterfell.
Could
Sam
be
right?
Even
a
bastard
could
rise
high
in
the
Night’s
Watch,
they
said.
“I
never
asked
for
this,”
he
said
stubbornly.

“None
of
us
are
here
for
asking,”
Sam
reminded
him.

And
suddenly
Jon
Snow
was
ashamed.

Craven
or
not,
Samwell
Tarly
had
found
the
courage
to
accept
his
fate
like
a
man.
On
the
Wall,
a
man
gets
only
what
he
earns,
Benjen
Stark
had
said
the
last
night
Jon
had
seen
him
alive.
You’re
no
ranger,
Jon,
only
a
green
boy
with
the
smell
of
summer
still
on
you.
He’d
heard
it
said
that
bastards
grow
up
faster
than
other
children;
on
the
Wall,
you
grew
up
or
you
died.

Jon
let
out
a
deep
sigh.
“You
have
the
right
of
it.
I
was
acting
the
boy.”

“Then
you’ll
stay
and
say
your
words
with
me?”

“The
old
gods
will
be
expecting
us.”
He
made
himself
smile.

They
set
out
late
that
afternoon.
The
Wall
had
no
gates
as
such,
neither
here
at
Castle
Black
nor
anywhere
along
its
three
hundred
miles.
They
led
their
horses
down
a
narrow
tunnel
cut
through
the
ice,
cold
dark
walls
pressing
in
around
them
as
the
passage
twisted
and
turned.
Three
times
their
way
was
blocked
by
iron
bars,
and
they
had
to
stop
while
Bowen
Marsh
drew
out
his
keys
and
unlocked
the
massive
chains
that
secured
them.
Jon
could
sense
the
vast
weight
pressing
down
on
him
as
he
waited
behind
the
Lord
Steward.
The
air
was
colder
than
a
tomb,
and
more
still.
He
felt
a
strange
relief
when
they
reemerged
into
the
afternoon
light
on
the
north
side
of
the
Wall.

Sam
blinked
at
the
sudden
glare
and
looked
around
apprehensively.
“The
wildlings…
they
wouldn’t…
they’d
never
dare
come
this
close
to
the
Wall.
Would
they?”

“They
never
have.”
Jon
climbed
into
his
saddle.
When
Bowen
Marsh
and
their
ranger
escort
had
mounted,
Jon
put
two
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
whistled.
Ghost
came
loping
out
of
the
tunnel.

The
Lord
Steward’s
garron
whickered
and
backed
away
from
the
direwolf.
“Do
you
mean
to
take
that
beast?”

“Yes,
my
lord,”
Jon
said.
Ghost’s
head
lifted.
He
seemed
to
taste
the
air.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye
he
was
off,
racing
across
the
broad,
weed-choked
field
to
vanish
in
the
trees.

Once
they
had
entered
the
forest,
they
were
in
a
different
world.
Jon
had
often
hunted
with
his
father
and
Jory
and
his
brother
Robb.
He
knew
the
wolfswood
around
Winterfell
as
well
as
any
man.
The
haunted
forest
was
much
the
same,
and
yet
the
feel
of
it
was
very
different.

Perhaps
it
was
all
in
the
knowing.
They
had
ridden
past
the
end
of
the
world;
somehow
that
changed
everything.
Every
shadow
seemed
darker,
every
sound
more
ominous.
The
trees
pressed
close
and
shut
out
the
light
of
the
setting
sun.
A
thin
crust
of
snow
cracked
beneath
the
hooves
of
their
horses,
with
a
sound
like
breaking
bones.
When
the
wind
set
the
leaves
to
rustling,
it
was
like
a
chilly
finger
tracing
a
path
up
Jon’s
spine.
The
Wall
was
at
their
backs,
and
only
the
gods
knew
what
lay
ahead.

The
sun
was
sinking
below
the
trees
when
they
reached
their
destination,
a
small
clearing
in
the
deep
of
the
wood
where
nine
weirwoods
grew
in
a
rough
circle.
Jon
drew
in
a
breath,
and
he
saw
Sam
Tarly
staring.
Even
in
the
wolfswood,
you
never
found
more
than
two
or
three
of
the
white
trees
growing
together;
a
grove
of
nine
was
unheard
of.
The
forest
floor
was
carpeted
with
fallen
leaves,
bloodred
on
top,
black
rot
beneath.
The
wide
smooth
trunks
were
bone
pale,
and
nine
faces
stared
inward.
The
dried
sap
that
crusted
in
the
eyes
was
red
and
hard
as
ruby.
Bowen
Marsh
commanded
them
to
leave
their
horses
outside
the
circle.
“This
is
a
sacred
place,
we
will
not
defile
it.”

When
they
entered
the
grove,
Samwell
Tarly
turned
slowly
looking
at
each
face
in
turn.
No
two
were
quite
alike.
“They’re
watching
us,”
he
whispered.
“The
old
gods.”

“Yes.”
Jon
knelt,
and
Sam
knelt
beside
him.

They
said
the
words
together,
as
the
last
light
faded
in
the
west
and
grey
day
became
black
night.

“Hear
my
words,
and
bear
witness
to
my
vow,”
they
recited,
their
voices
filling
the
twilit
grove.
“Night
gathers,
and
now
my
watch
begins.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.
I
shall
take
no
wife,
hold
no
lands,
father
no
children.
I
shall
wear
no
crowns
and
win
no
glory.
I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post.
I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness.
I
am
the
watcher
on
the
walls.
I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.
I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
Night’s
Watch,
for
this
night
and
all
the
nights
to
come.”

The
woods
fell
silent.
“You
knelt
as
boys,”
Bowen
Marsh
intoned
solemnly.
“Rise
now
as
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Jon
held
out
a
hand
to
pull
Sam
back
to
his
feet.
The
rangers
gathered
round
to
offer
smiles
and
congratulations,
all
but
the
gnarled
old
forester
Dywen.
“Best
we
be
starting
back,
m’lord,”
he
said
to
Bowen
Marsh.
“Dark’s
falling,
and
there’s
something
in
the
smell
o’
the
night
that
I
mislike.”

And
suddenly
Ghost
was
back,
stalking
softly
between
two
weirwoods.
White
fur
and
red
eyes,
Jon
realized,
disquieted.
Like
the
trees…

The
wolf
had
something
in
his
jaws.
Something
black.
“What’s
he
got
there?”
asked
Bowen
Marsh,
frowning.

“To
me,
Ghost.”
Jon
knelt.
“Bring
it
here.”

The
direwolf
trotted
to
him.
Jon
heard
Samwell
Tarly’s
sharp
intake
of
breath.

“Gods
be
good,”
Dywen
muttered.
“That’s
a
hand.”





EDDARD

The
grey
light
of
dawn
was
streaming
through
his
window
when
the
thunder
of
hoofbeats
awoke
Eddard
Stark
from
his
brief,
exhausted
sleep.
He
lifted
his
head
from
the
table
to
look
down
into
the
yard.
Below,
men
in
mail
and
leather
and
crimson
cloaks
were
making
the
morning
ring
to
the
sound
of
swords,
and
riding
down
mock
warriors
stuffed
with
straw.
Ned
watched
Sandor
Clegane
gallop
across
the
hard-packed
ground
to
drive
an
iron-tipped
lance
through
a
dummy’s
head.
Canvas
ripped
and
straw
exploded
as
Lannister
guardsmen
joked
and
cursed.

Is
this
brave
show
for
my
benefit?
he
wondered.
If
so,
Cersei
was
a
greater
fool
than
he’d
imagined.
Damn
her,
he
thought,
why
is
the
woman
not
fled?
I
have
given
her
chance
after
chance…

The
morning
was
overcast
and
grim.
Ned
broke
his
fast
with
his
daughters
and
Septa
Mordane.
Sansa,
still
disconsolate,
stared
sullenly
at
her
food
and
refused
to
eat,
but
Arya
wolfed
down
everything
that
was
set
in
front
of
her.
“Syrio
says
we
have
time
for
one
last
lesson
before
we
take
ship
this
evening,”
she
said.
“Can
I,
Father?
All
my
things
are
packed.”

“A
short
lesson,
and
make
certain
you
leave
yourself
time
to
bathe
and
change.
I
want
you
ready
to
leave
by
midday,
is
that
understood?”

“By
midday,”
Arya
said.

Sansa
looked
up
from
her
food.
“If
she
can
have
a
dancing
lesson,
why
won’t
you
let
me
say
farewell
to
Prince
Joffrey?”

“I
would
gladly
go
with
her,
Lord
Eddard,”
Septa
Mordane
offered.
“There
would
be
no
question
of
her
missing
the
ship.”

“It
would
not
be
wise
for
you
to
go
to
Joffrey
right
now,
Sansa.
I’m
sorry.”

Sansa’s
eyes
filled
with
tears.
“But
why?”

“Sansa,
your
lord
father
knows
best,”
Septa
Mordane
said.
“You
are
not
to
question
his
decisions.”

“It’s
not
fair!”
Sansa
pushed
back
from
her
table,
knocked
over
her
chair,
and
ran
weeping
from
the
solar.

Septa
Mordane
rose,
but
Ned
gestured
her
back
to
her
seat.
“Let
her
go,
Septa.
I
will
try
to
make
her
understand
when
we
are
all
safely
back
in
Winterfell.”
The
septa
bowed
her
head
and
sat
down
to
finish
her
breakfast.

It
was
an
hour
later
when
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
to
Eddard
Stark
in
his
solar.
His
shoulders
slumped,
as
if
the
weight
of
the
great
maester’s
chain
around
his
neck
had
become
too
great
to
bear.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“King
Robert
is
gone.
The
gods
give
him
rest.”

“No,”
Ned
answered.
“He
hated
rest.
The
gods
give
him
love
and
laughter,
and
the
joy
of
righteous
battle.”
It
was
strange
how
empty
he
felt.
He
had
been
expecting
the
visit,
and
yet
with
those
words,
something
died
within
him.
He
would
have
given
all
his
titles
for
the
freedom
to
weep…
but
he
was
Robert’s
Hand,
and
the
hour
he
dreaded
had
come.
“Be
so
good
as
to
summon
the
members
of
the
council
here
to
my
solar,”
he
told
Pycelle.
The
Tower
of
the
Hand
was
as
secure
as
he
and
Tomard
could
make
it;
he
could
not
say
the
same
for
the
council
chambers.

“My
lord?”
Pycelle
blinked.
“Surely
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
will
keep
till
the
morrow,
when
our
grief
is
not
so
fresh.”

Ned
was
quiet
but
firm.
“I
fear
we
must
convene
at
once.”

Pycelle
bowed.
“As
the
Hand
commands.”
He
called
his
servants
and
sent
them
running,
then
gratefully
accepted
Ned’s
offer
of
a
chair
and
a
cup
of
sweet
beer.

Ser
Barristan
Selmy
was
the
first
to
answer
the
summons,
immaculate
in
white
cloak
and
enameled
scales.
“My
lords,”
he
said,
“my
place
is
beside
the
young
king
now.
Pray
give
me
leave
to
attend
him.”

“Your
place
is
here,
Ser
Barristan,”
Ned
told
him.

Littlefinger
came
next,
still
garbed
in
the
blue
velvets
and
silver
mockingbird
cape
he
had
worn
the
night
previous,
his
boots
dusty
from
riding.
“My
lords,”
he
said,
smiling
at
nothing
in
particular
before
he
turned
to
Ned.
“That
little
task
you
set
me
is
accomplished,
Lord
Eddard.”

Varys
entered
in
a
wash
of
lavender,
pink
from
his
bath,
his
plump
face
scrubbed
and
freshly
powdered,
his
soft
slippers
all
but
soundless.
“The
little
birds
sing
a
grievous
song
today,”
he
said
as
he
seated
himself.
“The
realm
weeps.
Shall
we
begin?”

“When
Lord
Renly
arrives,”
Ned
said.

Varys
gave
him
a
sorrowful
look.
“I
fear
Lord
Renly
has
left
the
city.”

“Left
the
city?”
Ned
had
counted
on
Renly’s
support.

“He
took
his
leave
through
a
postern
gate
an
hour
before
dawn,
accompanied
by
Ser
Loras
Tyrell
and
some
fifty
retainers,”
Varys
told
them.
“When
last
seen,
they
were
galloping
south
in
some
haste,
no
doubt
bound
for
Storm’s
End
or
Highgarden.”

So
much
for
Renly
and
his
hundred
swords.
Ned
did
not
like
the
smell
of
that,
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
it.
He
drew
out
Robert’s
last
letter.
“The
king
called
me
to
his
side
last
night
and
commanded
me
to
record
his
final
words.
Lord
Renly
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stood
witness
as
Robert
sealed
the
letter,
to
be
opened
by
the
council
after
his
death.
Ser
Barristan,
if
you
would
be
so
kind?”

The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
examined
the
paper.
“King
Robert’s
seal,
and
unbroken.”
He
opened
the
letter
and
read.
“Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
herein
named
Protector
of
the
Realm,
to
rule
as
regent
until
the
heir
comes
of
age.”

And
as
it
happens,
he
is
of
age,
Ned
reflected,
but
he
did
not
give
voice
to
the
thought.
He
trusted
neither
Pycelle
nor
Varys,
and
Ser
Barristan
was
honor-bound
to
protect
and
defend
the
boy
he
thought
his
new
king.
The
old
knight
would
not
abandon
Joffrey
easily.
The
need
for
deceit
was
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth,
but
Ned
knew
he
must
tread
softly
here,
must
keep
his
counsel
and
play
the
game
until
he
was
firmly
established
as
regent.
There
would
be
time
enough
to
deal
with
the
succession
when
Arya
and
Sansa
were
safely
back
in
Winterfell,
and
Lord
Stannis
had
returned
to
King’s
Landing
with
all
his
power.

“I
would
ask
this
council
to
confirm
me
as
Lord
Protector,
as
Robert
wished,”
Ned
said,
watching
their
faces,
wondering
what
thoughts
hid
behind
Pycelle’s
half-closed
eyes,
Littlefinger’s
lazy
half-smile,
and
the
nervous
flutter
of
Varys’s
fingers.

The
door
opened.
Fat
Tom
stepped
into
the
solar.
“Pardon,
my
lords,
the
king’s
steward
insists…”

The
royal
steward
entered
and
bowed.
“Esteemed
lords,
the
king
demands
the
immediate
presence
of
his
small
council
in
the
throne
room.”

Ned
had
expected
Cersei
to
strike
quickly;
the
summons
came
as
no
surprise.
“The
king
is
dead,”
he
said,
“but
we
shall
go
with
you
nonetheless.
Tom,
assemble
an
escort,
if
you
would.”

Littlefinger
gave
Ned
his
arm
to
help
him
down
the
steps.
Varys,
Pycelle,
and
Ser
Barristan
followed
close
behind.
A
double
column
of
men-at-arms
in
chainmail
and
steel
helms
was
waiting
outside
the
tower,
eight
strong.
Grey
cloaks
snapped
in
the
wind
as
the
guardsmen
marched
them
across
the
yard.
There
was
no
Lannister
crimson
to
be
seen,
but
Ned
was
reassured
by
the
number
of
gold
cloaks
visible
on
the
ramparts
and
at
the
gates.

Janos
Slynt
met
them
at
the
door
to
the
throne
room,
armored
in
ornate
black-and-gold
plate,
with
a
high-crested
helm
under
one
arm.
The
Commander
bowed
stiffly.
His
men
pushed
open
the
great
oaken
doors,
twenty
feet
tall
and
banded
with
bronze.

The
royal
steward
led
them
in.
“All
hail
His
Grace,
Joffrey
of
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals
and
the
Rhoynar
and
the
First
Men,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm,”
he
sang
out.

It
was
a
long
walk
to
the
far
end
of
the
hall,
where
Joffrey
waited
atop
the
Iron
Throne.
Supported
by
Littlefinger,
Ned
Stark
slowly
limped
and
hopped
toward
the
boy
who
called
himself
king.
The
others
followed.
The
first
time
he
had
come
this
way,
he
had
been
on
horseback,
sword
in
hand,
and
the
Targaryen
dragons
had
watched
from
the
walls
as
he
forced
Jaime
Lannister
down
from
the
throne.
He
wondered
if
Joffrey
would
step
down
quite
so
easily.

Five
knights
of
the
Kingsguard—all
but
Ser
Jaime
and
Ser
Barristan—were
arrayed
in
a
crescent
around
the
base
of
the
throne.
They
were
in
full
armor,
enameled
steel
from
helm
to
heel,
long
pale
cloaks
over
their
shoulders,
shining
white
shields
strapped
to
their
left
arms.
Cersei
Lannister
and
her
two
younger
children
stood
behind
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn.
The
queen
wore
a
gown
of
sea-green
silk,
trimmed
with
Myrish
lace
as
pale
as
foam.
On
her
finger
was
a
golden
ring
with
an
emerald
the
size
of
a
pigeon’s
egg,
on
her
head
a
matching
tiara.

Above
them,
Prince
Joffrey
sat
amidst
the
barbs
and
spikes
in
a
cloth-of-gold
doublet
and
a
red
satin
cape.
Sandor
Clegane
was
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
throne’s
steep
narrow
stair.
He
wore
mail
and
soot-grey
plate
and
his
snarling
dog’s-head
helm.

Behind
the
throne,
twenty
Lannister
guardsmen
waited
with
longswords
hanging
from
their
belts.
Crimson
cloaks
draped
their
shoulders
and
steel
lions
crested
their
helms.
But
Littlefinger
had
kept
his
promise;
all
along
the
walls,
in
front
of
Robert’s
tapestries
with
their
scenes
of
hunt
and
battle,
the
gold-cloaked
ranks
of
the
City
Watch
stood
stiffly
to
attention,
each
man’s
hand
clasped
around
the
haft
of
an
eight-foot-long
spear
tipped
in
black
iron.
They
outnumbered
the
Lannisters
five
to
one.

Ned’s
leg
was
a
blaze
of
pain
by
the
time
he
stopped.
He
kept
a
hand
on
Littlefinger’s
shoulder
to
help
support
his
weight.

Joffrey
stood.
His
red
satin
cape
was
patterned
in
gold
thread;
fifty
roaring
lions
to
one
side,
fifty
prancing
stags
to
the
other.
“I
command
the
council
to
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
my
coronation,”
the
boy
proclaimed.
“I
wish
to
be
crowned
within
the
fortnight.
Today
I
shall
accept
oaths
of
fealty
from
my
loyal
councillors.”

Ned
produced
Robert’s
letter.
“Lord
Varys,
be
so
kind
as
to
show
this
to
my
lady
of
Lannister.”

The
eunuch
carried
the
letter
to
Cersei.
The
queen
glanced
at
the
words.
“Protector
of
the
Realm,”
she
read.
“Is
this
meant
to
be
your
shield,
my
lord?
A
piece
of
paper?”
She
ripped
the
letter
in
half,
ripped
the
halves
in
quarters,
and
let
the
pieces
flutter
to
the
floor.

“Those
were
the
king’s
words,”
Ser
Barristan
said,
shocked.

“We
have
a
new
king
now,”
Cersei
Lannister
replied.
“Lord
Eddard,
when
last
we
spoke,
you
gave
me
some
counsel.
Allow
me
to
return
the
courtesy.
Bend
the
knee,
my
lord.
Bend
the
knee
and
swear
fealty
to
my
son,
and
we
shall
allow
you
to
step
down
as
Hand
and
live
out
your
days
in
the
grey
waste
you
call
home.”

“Would
that
I
could,”
Ned
said
grimly.
If
she
was
so
determined
to
force
the
issue
here
and
now,
she
left
him
no
choice.
“Your
son
has
no
claim
to
the
throne
he
sits.
Lord
Stannis
is
Robert’s
true
heir.”

“Liar!”
Joffrey
screamed,
his
face
reddening.

“Mother,
what
does
he
mean?”
Princess
Myrcella
asked
the
queen
plaintively.
“Isn’t
Joff
the
king
now?”

“You
condemn
yourself
with
your
own
mouth,
Lord
Stark,”
said
Cersei
Lannister.
“Ser
Barristan,
seize
this
traitor.”

The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
hesitated.
In
the
blink
of
an
eye
he
was
surrounded
by
Stark
guardsmen,
bare
steel
in
their
mailed
fists.

“And
now
the
treason
moves
from
words
to
deeds,”
Cersei
said.
“Do
you
think
Ser
Barristan
stands
alone,
my
lord?”
With
an
ominous
rasp
of
metal
on
metal,
the
Hound
drew
his
longsword.
The
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
and
twenty
Lannister
guardsmen
in
crimson
cloaks
moved
to
support
him.

“Kill
him!”
the
boy
king
screamed
down
from
the
Iron
Throne.
“Kill
all
of
them,
I
command
it!”

“You
leave
me
no
choice,”
Ned
told
Cersei
Lannister.
He
called
out
to
Janos
Slynt.
“Commander,
take
the
queen
and
her
children
into
custody.
Do
them
no
harm,
but
escort
them
back
to
the
royal
apartments
and
keep
them
there,
under
guard.”

“Men
of
the
Watch!”
Janos
Slynt
shouted,
donning
his
helm.
A
hundred
gold
cloaks
leveled
their
spears
and
closed.

“I
want
no
bloodshed,”
Ned
told
the
queen.
“Tell
your
men
to
lay
down
their
swords,
and
no
one
need—”

With
a
single
sharp
thrust,
the
nearest
gold
cloak
drove
his
spear
into
Tomard’s
back.
Fat
Tom’s
blade
dropped
from
nerveless
fingers
as
the
wet
red
point
burst
out
through
his
ribs,
piercing
leather
and
mail.
He
was
dead
before
his
sword
hit
the
floor.

Ned’s
shout
came
far
too
late.
Janos
Slynt
himself
slashed
open
Varly’s
throat.
Cayn
whirled,
steel
flashing,
drove
back
the
nearest
spearman
with
a
flurry
of
blows;
for
an
instant
it
looked
as
though
he
might
cut
his
way
free.
Then
the
Hound
was
on
him.
Sandor
Clegane’s
first
cut
took
off
Cayn’s
sword
hand
at
the
wrist;
his
second
drove
him
to
his
knees
and
opened
him
from
shoulder
to
breastbone.

As
his
men
died
around
him,
Littlefinger
slid
Ned’s
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
shoved
it
up
under
his
chin.
His
smile
was
apologetic.
“I
did
warn
you
not
to
trust
me,
you
know.”





ARYA

“High,”
Syrio
Forel
called
out,
slashing
at
her
head.
The
stick
swords
clacked
as
Arya
parried.

“Left,”
he
shouted,
and
his
blade
came
whistling.
Hers
darted
to
meet
it.
The
clack
made
him
click
his
teeth
together.

“Right,”
he
said,
and
“Low,”
and
“Left,”
and
“Left”
again,
faster
and
faster,
moving
forward.
Arya
retreated
before
him,
checking
each
blow.

“Lunge,”
he
warned,
and
when
he
thrust
she
sidestepped,
swept
his
blade
away,
and
slashed
at
his
shoulder.
She
almost
touched
him,
almost,
so
close
it
made
her
grin.
A
strand
of
hair
dangled
in
her
eyes,
limp
with
sweat.
She
pushed
it
away
with
the
back
of
her
hand.

“Left,”
Syrio
sang
out.
“Low.”
His
sword
was
a
blur,
and
the
Small
Hall
echoed
to
the
clack
clack
clack.
“Left.
Left.
High.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Low.
Left!”

The
wooden
blade
caught
her
high
in
the
breast,
a
sudden
stinging
blow
that
hurt
all
the
more
because
it
came
from
the
wrong
side.
“Ow,”
she
cried
out.
She
would
have
a
fresh
bruise
there
by
the
time
she
went
to
sleep,
somewhere
out
at
sea.
A
bruise
is
a
lesson,
she
told
herself,
and
each
lesson
makes
us
better.

Syrio
stepped
back.
“You
are
dead
now.”

Arya
made
a
face.
“You
cheated,”
she
said
hotly.
“You
said
left
and
you
went
right.”

“Just
so.
And
now
you
are
a
dead
girl.”

“But
you
lied!”

“My
words
lied.
My
eyes
and
my
arm
shouted
out
the
truth,
but
you
were
not
seeing.”

“I
was
so,”
Arya
said.
“I
watched
you
every
second!”

“Watching
is
not
seeing,
dead
girl.
The
water
dancer
sees.
Come,
put
down
the
sword,
it
is
time
for
listening
now.”

She
followed
him
over
to
the
wall,
where
he
settled
onto
a
bench.
“Syrio
Forel
was
first
sword
to
the
Sealord
of
Braavos,
and
are
you
knowing
how
that
came
to
pass?”

“You
were
the
finest
swordsman
in
the
city.”

“Just
so,
but
why?
Other
men
were
stronger,
faster,
younger,
why
was
Syrio
Forel
the
best?
I
will
tell
you
now.”
He
touched
the
tip
of
his
little
finger
lightly
to
his
eyelid.
“The
seeing,
the
true
seeing,
that
is
the
heart
of
it.

“Hear
me.
The
ships
of
Braavos
sail
as
far
as
the
winds
blow,
to
lands
strange
and
wonderful,
and
when
they
return
their
captains
fetch
queer
animals
to
the
Sealord’s
menagerie.
Such
animals
as
you
have
never
seen,
striped
horses,
great
spotted
things
with
necks
as
long
as
stilts,
hairy
mouse-pigs
as
big
as
cows,
stinging
manticores,
tigers
that
carry
their
cubs
in
a
pouch,
terrible
walking
lizards
with
scythes
for
claws.
Syrio
Forel
has
seen
these
things.

“On
the
day
I
am
speaking
of,
the
first
sword
was
newly
dead,
and
the
Sealord
sent
for
me.
Many
bravos
had
come
to
him,
and
as
many
had
been
sent
away,
none
could
say
why.
When
I
came
into
his
presence,
he
was
seated,
and
in
his
lap
was
a
fat
yellow
cat.
He
told
me
that
one
of
his
captains
had
brought
the
beast
to
him,
from
an
island
beyond
the
sunrise.
‘Have
you
ever
seen
her
like?’
he
asked
of
me.

“And
to
him
I
said,
‘Each
night
in
the
alleys
of
Braavos
I
see
a
thousand
like
him,’
and
the
Sealord
laughed,
and
that
day
I
was
named
the
first
sword.”

Arya
screwed
up
her
face.
“I
don’t
understand.”

Syrio
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“The
cat
was
an
ordinary
cat,
no
more.
The
others
expected
a
fabulous
beast,
so
that
is
what
they
saw.
How
large
it
was,
they
said.
It
was
no
larger
than
any
other
cat,
only
fat
from
indolence,
for
the
Sealord
fed
it
from
his
own
table.
What
curious
small
ears,
they
said.
Its
ears
had
been
chewed
away
in
kitten
fights.
And
it
was
plainly
a
tomcat,
yet
the
Sealord
said
‘her,’
and
that
is
what
the
others
saw.
Are
you
hearing?”

Arya
thought
about
it.
“You
saw
what
was
there.”

“Just
so.
Opening
your
eyes
is
all
that
is
needing.
The
heart
lies
and
the
head
plays
tricks
with
us,
but
the
eyes
see
true.
Look
with
your
eyes.
Hear
with
your
ears.
Taste
with
your
mouth.
Smell
with
your
nose.
Feel
with
your
skin.
Then
comes
the
thinking,
afterward,
and
in
that
way
knowing
the
truth.”

“Just
so,”
said
Arya,
grinning.

Syrio
Forel
allowed
himself
a
smile.
“I
am
thinking
that
when
we
are
reaching
this
Winterfell
of
yours,
it
will
be
time
to
put
this
needle
in
your
hand.”

“Yes!”
Arya
said
eagerly.
“Wait
till
I
show
Jon—”

Behind
her
the
great
wooden
doors
of
the
Small
Hall
flew
open
with
a
resounding
crash.
Arya
whirled.

A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard
stood
beneath
the
arch
of
the
door
with
five
Lannister
guardsmen
arrayed
behind
him.
He
was
in
full
armor,
but
his
visor
was
up.
Arya
remembered
his
droopy
eyes
and
rustcolored
whiskers
from
when
he
had
come
to
Winterfell
with
the
king:
Ser
Meryn
Trant.
The
red
cloaks
wore
mail
shirts
over
boiled
leather
and
steel
caps
with
lion
crests.
“Arya
Stark,”
the
knight
said,
“come
with
us,
child.”

Arya
chewed
her
lip
uncertainly.
“What
do
you
want?”

“Your
father
wants
to
see
you.”

Arya
took
a
step
forward,
but
Syrio
Forel
held
her
by
the
arm.
“And
why
is
it
that
Lord
Eddard
is
sending
Lannister
men
in
the
place
of
his
own?
I
am
wondering.”

“Mind
your
place,
dancing
master,”
Ser
Meryn
said.
“This
is
no
concern
of
yours.”

“My
father
wouldn’t
send
you,”
Arya
said.
She
snatched
up
her
stick
sword.
The
Lannisters
laughed.

“Put
down
the
stick,
girl,”
Ser
Meryn
told
her.
“I
am
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Kingsguard,
the
White
Swords.”

“So
was
the
Kingslayer
when
he
killed
the
old
king,”
Arya
said.
“I
don’t
have
to
go
with
you
if
I
don’t
want.”

Ser
Meryn
Trant
ran
out
of
patience.
“Take
her,”
he
said
to
his
men.
He
lowered
the
visor
of
his
helm.

Three
of
them
started
forward,
chainmail
clinking
softly
with
each
step.
Arya
was
suddenly
afraid.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
she
told
herself,
to
slow
the
racing
of
her
heart.

Syrio
Forel
stepped
between
them,
tapping
his
wooden
sword
lightly
against
his
boot.
“You
will
be
stopping
there.
Are
you
men
or
dogs
that
you
would
threaten
a
child?”

“Out
of
the
way,
old
man,”
one
of
the
red
cloaks
said.

Syrio’s
stick
came
whistling
up
and
rang
against
his
helm.
“I
am
Syrio
Forel,
and
you
will
now
be
speaking
to
me
with
more
respect.”

“Bald
bastard.”
The
man
yanked
free
his
longsword.
The
stick
moved
again,
blindingly
fast.
Arya
heard
a
loud
crack
as
the
sword
went
clattering
to
the
stone
floor.
“My
hand,”
the
guardsman
yelped,
cradling
his
broken
fingers.

“You
are
quick,
for
a
dancing
master,”
said
Ser
Meryn.

“You
are
slow,
for
a
knight,”
Syrio
replied.

“Kill
the
Braavosi
and
bring
me
the
girl,”
the
knight
in
the
white
armor
commanded.

Four
Lannister
guardsmen
unsheathed
their
swords.
The
fifth,
with
the
broken
fingers,
spat
and
pulled
free
a
dagger
with
his
left
hand.

Syrio
Forel
clicked
his
teeth
together,
sliding
into
his
water
dancer’s
stance,
presenting
only
his
side
to
the
foe.
“Arya
child,”
he
called
out,
never
looking,
never
taking
his
eyes
off
the
Lannisters,
“we
are
done
with
dancing
for
the
day.
Best
you
are
going
now.
Run
to
your
father.”

Arya
did
not
want
to
leave
him,
but
he
had
taught
her
to
do
as
he
said.
“Swift
as
a
deer,”
she
whispered.

“Just
so,”
said
Syrio
Forel
as
the
Lannisters
closed.

Arya
retreated,
her
own
sword
stick
clutched
tightly
in
her
hand.
Watching
him
now,
she
realized
that
Syrio
had
only
been
toying
with
her
when
they
dueled.
The
red
cloaks
came
at
him
from
three
sides
with
steel
in
their
hands.
They
had
chainmail
over
their
chest
and
arms,
and
steel
codpieces
sewn
into
their
pants,
but
only
leather
on
their
legs.
Their
hands
were
bare,
and
the
caps
they
wore
had
noseguards,
but
no
visor
over
the
eyes.

Syrio
did
not
wait
for
them
to
reach
him,
but
spun
to
his
left.
Arya
had
never
seen
a
man
move
as
fast.
He
checked
one
sword
with
his
stick
and
whirled
away
from
a
second.
Off
balance,
the
second
man
lurched
into
the
first.
Syrio
put
a
boot
to
his
back
and
the
red
cloaks
went
down
together.
The
third
guard
came
leaping
over
them,
slashing
at
the
water
dancer’s
head.
Syrio
ducked
under
his
blade
and
thrust
upward.
The
guardsman
fell
screaming
as
blood
welled
from
the
wet
red
hole
where
his
left
eye
had
been.

The
fallen
men
were
getting
up.
Syrio
kicked
one
in
the
face
and
snatched
the
steel
cap
off
the
other’s
head.
The
dagger
man
stabbed
at
him.
Syrio
caught
the
thrust
in
the
helmet
and
shattered
the
man’s
kneecap
with
his
stick.
The
last
red
cloak
shouted
a
curse
and
charged,
hacking
down
with
both
hands
on
his
sword.
Syrio
rolled
right,
and
the
butcher’s
cut
caught
the
helmetless
man
between
neck
and
shoulder
as
he
struggled
to
his
knees.
The
longsword
crunched
through
mail
and
leather
and
flesh.
The
man
on
his
knees
shrieked.
Before
his
killer
could
wrench
free
his
blade,
Syrio
jabbed
him
in
the
apple
of
his
throat.
The
guardsman
gave
a
choked
cry
and
staggered
back,
clutching
at
his
neck,
his
face
blackening.

Five
men
were
down,
dead,
or
dying
by
the
time
Arya
reached
the
back
door
that
opened
on
the
kitchen.
She
heard
Ser
Meryn
Trant
curse.
“Bloody
oafs,”
he
swore,
drawing
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.

Syrio
Forel
resumed
his
stance
and
clicked
his
teeth
together.
“Arya
child,”
he
called
out,
never
looking
at
her,
“be
gone
now.”

Look
with
your
eyes,
he
had
said.
She
saw:
the
knight
in
his
pale
armor
head
to
foot,
legs,
throat,
and
hands
sheathed
in
metal,
eyes
hidden
behind
his
high
white
helm,
and
in
his
hand
cruel
steel.
Against
that:
Syrio,
in
a
leather
vest,
with
a
wooden
sword
in
his
hand.
“Syrio,
run,”
she
screamed.

“The
first
sword
of
Braavos
does
not
run,”
he
sang
as
Ser
Meryn
slashed
at
him.
Syrio
danced
away
from
his
cut,
his
stick
a
blur.
In
a
heartbeat,
he
had
bounced
blows
off
the
knight’s
temple,
elbow,
and
throat,
the
wood
ringing
against
the
metal
of
helm,
gauntlet,
and
gorget.
Arya
stood
frozen.
Ser
Meryn
advanced;
Syrio
backed
away.
He
checked
the
next
blow,
spun
away
from
the
second,
deflected
the
third.

The
fourth
sliced
his
stick
in
two,
splintering
the
wood
and
shearing
through
the
lead
core.

Sobbing,
Arya
spun
and
ran.

She
plunged
through
the
kitchens
and
buttery,
blind
with
panic,
weaving
between
cooks
and
potboys.
A
baker’s
helper
stepped
in
front
of
her,
holding
a
wooden
tray.
Arya
bowled
her
over,
scattering
fragrant
loaves
of
fresh-baked
bread
on
the
floor.
She
heard
shouting
behind
her
as
she
spun
around
a
portly
butcher
who
stood
gaping
at
her
with
a
cleaver
in
his
hands.
His
arms
were
red
to
the
elbow.

All
that
Syrio
Forel
had
taught
her
went
racing
through
her
head.
Swift
as
a
deer.
Quiet
as
a
shadow.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Quick
as
a
snake.
Calm
as
still
water.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Strong
as
a
bear.
Fierce
as
a
wolverine.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
The
man
who
fears
losing
has
already
lost.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords.
The
grip
of
her
wooden
sword
was
slick
with
sweat,
and
Arya
was
breathing
hard
when
she
reached
the
turret
stair.
For
an
instant
she
froze.
Up
or
down?
Up
would
take
her
to
the
covered
bridge
that
spanned
the
small
court
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
but
that
would
be
the
way
they’d
expect
her
to
go,
for
certain.
Never
do
what
they
expect,
Syrio
once
said.
Arya
went
down,
around
and
around,
leaping
over
the
narrow
stone
steps
two
and
three
at
a
time.
She
emerged
in
a
cavernous
vaulted
cellar,
surrounded
by
casks
of
ale
stacked
twenty
feet
tall.
The
only
light
came
through
narrow
slanting
windows
high
in
the
wall.

The
cellar
was
a
dead
end.
There
was
no
way
out
but
the
way
she
had
come
in.
She
dare
not
go
back
up
those
steps,
but
she
couldn’t
stay
here,
either.
She
had
to
find
her
father
and
tell
him
what
had
happened.
Her
father
would
protect
her.

Arya
thrust
her
wooden
sword
through
her
belt
and
began
to
climb,
leaping
from
cask
to
cask
until
she
could
reach
the
window.
Grasping
the
stone
with
both
hands,
she
pulled
herself
up.
The
wall
was
three
feet
thick,
the
window
a
tunnel
slanting
up
and
out.
Arya
wriggled
toward
daylight.
When
her
head
reached
ground
level,
she
peered
across
the
bailey
to
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

The
stout
wooden
door
hung
splintered
and
broken,
as
if
by
axes.
A
dead
man
sprawled
facedown
on
the
steps,
his
cloak
tangled
beneath
him,
the
back
of
his
mailed
shirt
soaked
red.
The
corpse’s
cloak
was
grey
wool
trimmed
with
white
satin,
she
saw
with
sudden
terror.
She
could
not
tell
who
he
was.

“No,”
she
whispered.
What
was
happening?
Where
was
her
father?
Why
had
the
red
cloaks
come
for
her?
She
remembered
what
the
man
with
the
yellow
beard
had
said,
the
day
she
had
found
the
monsters.
If
one
Hand
can
die,
why
not
a
second?
Arya
felt
tears
in
her
eyes.
She
held
her
breath
to
listen.
She
heard
the
sounds
of
fighting,
shouts,
screams,
the
clang
of
steel
on
steel,
coming
through
the
windows
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.

She
could
not
go
back.
Her
father…

Arya
closed
her
eyes.
For
a
moment
she
was
too
frightened
to
move.
They
had
killed
Jory
and
Wyl
and
Heward,
and
that
guardsman
on
the
step,
whoever
he
had
been.
They
could
kill
her
father
too,
and
her
if
they
caught
her.
“Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,”
she
said
aloud,
but
it
was
no
good
pretending
to
be
a
water
dancer,
Syrio
had
been
a
water
dancer
and
the
white
knight
had
probably
killed
him,
and
anyhow
she
was
only
a
little
girl
with
a
wooden
stick,
alone
and
afraid.

She
squirmed
out
into
the
yard,
glancing
around
warily
as
she
climbed
to
her
feet.
The
castle
seemed
deserted.
The
Red
Keep
was
never
deserted.
All
the
people
must
be
hiding
inside,
their
doors
barred.
Arya
glanced
up
longingly
at
her
bedchamber,
then
moved
away
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
keeping
close
to
the
wall
as
she
slid
from
shadow
to
shadow.
She
pretended
she
was
chasing
cats…
except
she
was
the
cat
now,
and
if
they
caught
her,
they
would
kill
her.

Moving
between
buildings
and
over
walls,
keeping
stone
to
her
back
wherever
possible
so
no
one
could
surprise
her,
Arya
reached
the
stables
almost
without
incident.
A
dozen
gold
cloaks
in
mail
and
plate
ran
past
as
she
was
edging
across
the
inner
bailey,
but
without
knowing
whose
side
they
were
on,
she
hunched
down
low
in
the
shadows
and
let
them
pass.

Hullen,
who
had
been
master
of
horse
at
Winterfell
as
long
as
Arya
could
remember,
was
slumped
on
the
ground
by
the
stable
door.
He
had
been
stabbed
so
many
times
it
looked
as
if
his
tunic
was
patterned
with
scarlet
flowers.
Arya
was
certain
he
was
dead,
but
when
she
crept
closer,
his
eyes
opened.
“Arya
Underfoot,”
he
whispered.
“You
must…
warn
your…
your
lord
father…”
Frothy
red
spittle
bubbled
from
his
mouth.
The
master
of
horse
closed
his
eyes
again
and
said
no
more.

Inside
were
more
bodies;
a
groom
she
had
played
with,
and
three
of
her
father’s
household
guard.
A
wagon,
laden
with
crates
and
chests,
stood
abandoned
near
the
door
of
the
stable.
The
dead
men
must
have
been
loading
it
for
the
trip
to
the
docks
when
they
were
attacked.
Arya
snuck
closer.
One
of
the
corpses
was
Desmond,
who’d
shown
her
his
longsword
and
promised
to
protect
her
father.
He
lay
on
his
back,
staring
blindly
at
the
ceiling
as
flies
crawled
across
his
eyes.
Close
to
him
was
a
dead
man
in
the
red
cloak
and
lion-crest
helm
of
the
Lannisters.
Only
one,
though.
Every
northerner
is
worth
ten
of
these
southron
swords,
Desmond
had
told
her.
“You
liar!”
she
said,
kicking
his
body
in
a
sudden
fury.

The
animals
were
restless
in
their
stalls,
whickering
and
snorting
at
the
scent
of
blood.
Arya’s
only
plan
was
to
saddle
a
horse
and
flee,
away
from
the
castle
and
the
city.
All
she
had
to
do
was
stay
on
the
kingsroad
and
it
would
take
her
back
to
Winterfell.
She
took
a
bridle
and
harness
off
the
wall.

As
she
crossed
in
back
of
the
wagon,
a
fallen
chest
caught
her
eye.
It
must
have
been
knocked
down
in
the
fight
or
dropped
as
it
was
being
loaded.
The
wood
had
split,
the
lid
opening
to
spill
the
chest’s
contents
across
the
ground.
Arya
recognized
silks
and
satins
and
velvets
she
never
wore.
She
might
need
warm
clothes
on
the
kingsroad,
though…
and
besides…

Arya
knelt
in
the
dirt
among
the
scattered
clothes.
She
found
a
heavy
woolen
cloak,
a
velvet
skirt
and
a
silk
tunic
and
some
smallclothes,
a
dress
her
mother
had
embroidered
for
her,
a
silver
baby
bracelet
she
might
sell.
Shoving
the
broken
lid
out
of
the
way,
she
groped
inside
the
chest
for
Needle.
She
had
hidden
it
way
down
at
the
bottom,
under
everything,
but
her
stuff
had
all
been
jumbled
around
when
the
chest
was
dropped.
For
a
moment
Arya
was
afraid
someone
had
found
the
sword
and
stolen
it.
Then
her
fingers
felt
the
hardness
of
metal
under
a
satin
gown.

“There
she
is,”
a
voice
hissed
close
behind
her.

Startled,
Arya
whirled.
A
stableboy
stood
behind
her,
a
smirk
on
his
face,
his
filthy
white
undertunic
peeking
out
from
beneath
a
soiled
jerkin.
His
boots
were
covered
with
manure,
and
he
had
a
pitchfork
in
one
hand.
“Who
are
you?”
she
asked.

“She
don’t
know
me,”
he
said,
“but
I
knows
her,
oh,
yes.
The
wolf
girl.”

“Help
me
saddle
a
horse,”
Arya
pleaded,
reaching
back
into
the
chest,
groping
for
Needle.
“My
father’s
the
Hand
of
the
King,
he’ll
reward
you.”

“Father’s
dead,”
the
boy
said.
He
shuffled
toward
her.
“It’s
the
queen
who’ll
be
rewarding
me.
Come
here,
girl.”

“Stay
away!”
Her
fingers
closed
around
Needle’s
hilt.

“I
says,
come.”
He
grabbed
her
arm,
hard.

Everything
Syrio
Forel
had
ever
taught
her
vanished
in
a
heartbeat.
In
that
instant
of
sudden
terror,
the
only
lesson
Arya
could
remember
was
the
one
Jon
Snow
had
given
her,
the
very
first.

She
stuck
him
with
the
pointy
end,
driving
the
blade
upward
with
a
wild,
hysterical
strength.

Needle
went
through
his
leather
jerkin
and
the
white
flesh
of
his
belly
and
came
out
between
his
shoulder
blades.
The
boy
dropped
the
pitchfork
and
made
a
soft
noise,
something
between
a
gasp
and
a
sigh.
His
hands
closed
around
the
blade.
“Oh,
gods,”
he
moaned,
as
his
undertunic
began
to
redden.
“Take
it
out.”

When
she
took
it
out,
he
died.

The
horses
were
screaming.
Arya
stood
over
the
body,
still
and
frightened
in
the
face
of
death.
Blood
had
gushed
from
the
boy’s
mouth
as
he
collapsed,
and
more
was
seeping
from
the
slit
in
his
belly,
pooling
beneath
his
body.
His
palms
were
cut
where
he’d
grabbed
at
the
blade.
She
backed
away
slowly,
Needle
red
in
her
hand.
She
had
to
get
away,
someplace
far
from
here,
someplace
safe
away
from
the
stableboy’s
accusing
eyes.

She
snatched
up
the
bridle
and
harness
again
and
ran
to
her
mare,
but
as
she
lifted
the
saddle
to
the
horse’s
back,
Arya
realized
with
a
sudden
sick
dread
that
the
castle
gates
would
be
closed.
Even
the
postern
doors
would
likely
be
guarded.
Maybe
the
guards
wouldn’t
recognize
her.
If
they
thought
she
was
a
boy,
perhaps
they’d
let
her…
no,
they’d
have
orders
not
to
let
anyone
out,
it
wouldn’t
matter
whether
they
knew
her
or
not.

But
there
was
another
way
out
of
the
castle…

The
saddle
slipped
from
Arya’s
fingers
and
fell
to
the
dirt
with
a
thump
and
a
puff
of
dust.
Could
she
find
the
room
with
the
monsters
again?
She
wasn’t
certain,
yet
she
knew
she
had
to
try.

She
found
the
clothing
she’d
gathered
and
slipped
into
the
cloak,
concealing
Needle
beneath
its
folds.
The
rest
of
her
things
she
tied
in
a
roll.
With
the
bundle
under
her
arm,
she
crept
to
the
far
end
of
the
stable.
Unlatching
the
back
door,
she
peeked
out
anxiously.
She
could
hear
the
distant
sound
of
swordplay,
and
the
shivery
wail
of
a
man
screaming
in
pain
across
the
bailey.
She
would
need
to
go
down
the
serpentine
steps,
past
the
small
kitchen
and
the
pig
yard,
that
was
how
she’d
gone
last
time,
chasing
the
black
tomcat…
only
that
would
take
her
right
past
the
barracks
of
the
gold
cloaks.
She
couldn’t
go
that
way.
Arya
tried
to
think
of
another
way.
If
she
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
castle,
she
could
creep
along
the
river
wall
and
through
the
little
godswood…
but
first
she’d
have
to
cross
the
yard,
in
the
plain
view
of
the
guards
on
the
walls.

She
had
never
seen
so
many
men
on
the
walls.
Gold
cloaks,
most
of
them,
armed
with
spears.
Some
of
them
knew
her
by
sight.
What
would
they
do
if
they
saw
her
running
across
the
yard?
She’d
look
so
small
from
up
there,
would
they
be
able
to
tell
who
she
was?
Would
they
care?

She
had
to
leave
now,
she
told
herself,
but
when
the
moment
came,
she
was
too
frightened
to
move.

Calm
as
still
water,
a
small
voice
whispered
in
her
ear.
Arya
was
so
startled
she
almost
dropped
her
bundle.
She
looked
around
wildly,
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
stable
but
her,
and
the
horses,
and
the
dead
men.

Quiet
as
a
shadow,
she
heard.
Was
it
her
own
voice,
or
Syrio’s?
She
could
not
tell,
yet
somehow
it
calmed
her
fears.

She
stepped
out
of
the
stable.

It
was
the
scariest
thing
she’d
ever
done.
She
wanted
to
run
and
hide,
but
she
made
herself
walk
across
the
yard,
slowly,
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
as
if
she
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
and
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
anyone.
She
thought
she
could
feel
their
eyes,
like
bugs
crawling
on
her
skin
under
her
clothes.
Arya
never
looked
up.
If
she
saw
them
watching,
all
her
courage
would
desert
her,
she
knew,
and
she
would
drop
the
bundle
of
clothes
and
run
and
cry
like
a
baby,
and
then
they
would
have
her.
She
kept
her
gaze
on
the
ground.
By
the
time
she
reached
the
shadow
of
the
royal
sept
on
the
far
side
of
the
yard,
Arya
was
cold
with
sweat,
but
no
one
had
raised
the
hue
and
cry.

The
sept
was
open
and
empty.
Inside,
half
a
hundred
prayer
candles
burned
in
a
fragrant
silence.
Arya
figured
the
gods
would
never
miss
two.
She
stuffed
them
up
her
sleeves,
and
left
by
a
back
window.
Sneaking
back
to
the
alley
where
she
had
cornered
the
one-eared
tom
was
easy,
but
after
that
she
got
lost.
She
crawled
in
and
out
of
windows,
hopped
over
walls,
and
felt
her
way
through
dark
cellars,
quiet
as
a
shadow.
Once
she
heard
a
woman
weeping.
It
took
her
more
than
an
hour
to
find
the
low
narrow
window
that
slanted
down
to
the
dungeon
where
the
monsters
waited.

She
tossed
her
bundle
through
and
doubled
back
to
light
her
candle.
That
was
chancy;
the
fire
she’d
remembered
seeing
had
burnt
down
to
embers,
and
she
heard
voices
as
she
was
blowing
on
the
coals.
Cupping
her
fingers
around
the
flickering
candle,
she
went
out
the
window
as
they
were
coming
in
the
door,
without
ever
getting
a
glimpse
of
who
it
was.

This
time
the
monsters
did
not
frighten
her.
They
seemed
almost
old
friends.
Arya
held
the
candle
over
her
head.
With
each
step
she
took,
the
shadows
moved
against
the
walls,
as
if
they
were
turning
to
watch
her
pass.
“Dragons,”
she
whispered.
She
slid
Needle
out
from
under
her
cloak.
The
slender
blade
seemed
very
small
and
the
dragons
very
big,
yet
somehow
Arya
felt
better
with
steel
in
her
hand.

The
long
windowless
hall
beyond
the
door
was
as
black
as
she
remembered.
She
held
Needle
in
her
left
hand,
her
sword
hand,
the
candle
in
her
right
fist.
Hot
wax
ran
down
across
her
knuckles.
The
entrance
to
the
well
had
been
to
the
left,
so
Arya
went
right.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
run,
but
she
was
afraid
of
snuffing
out
her
candle.
She
heard
the
faint
squeaking
of
rats
and
glimpsed
a
pair
of
tiny
glowing
eyes
on
the
edge
of
the
light,
but
rats
did
not
scare
her.
Other
things
did.
It
would
be
so
easy
to
hide
here,
as
she
had
hidden
from
the
wizard
and
the
man
with
the
forked
beard.
She
could
almost
see
the
stableboy
standing
against
the
wall,
his
hands
curled
into
claws
with
the
blood
still
dripping
from
the
deep
gashes
in
his
palms
where
Needle
had
cut
him.
He
might
be
waiting
to
grab
her
as
she
passed.
He
would
see
her
candle
coming
a
long
way
off.
Maybe
she
would
be
better
off
without
the
light…

Fear
cuts
deeper
than
swords,
the
quiet
voice
inside
her
whispered.
Suddenly
Arya
remembered
the
crypts
at
Winterfell.
They
were
a
lot
scarier
than
this
place,
she
told
herself.
She’d
been
just
a
little
girl
the
first
time
she
saw
them.
Her
brother
Robb
had
taken
them
down,
her
and
Sansa
and
baby
Bran,
who’d
been
no
bigger
than
Rickon
was
now.
They’d
only
had
one
candle
between
them,
and
Bran’s
eyes
had
gotten
as
big
as
saucers
as
he
stared
at
the
stone
faces
of
the
Kings
of
Winter,
with
their
wolves
at
their
feet
and
their
iron
swords
across
their
laps.

Robb
took
them
all
the
way
down
to
the
end,
past
Grandfather
and
Brandon
and
Lyanna,
to
show
them
their
own
tombs.
Sansa
kept
looking
at
the
stubby
little
candle,
anxious
that
it
might
go
out.
Old
Nan
had
told
her
there
were
spiders
down
here,
and
rats
as
big
as
dogs.
Robb
smiled
when
she
said
that.
“There
are
worse
things
than
spiders
and
rats,”
he
whispered.
“This
is
where
the
dead
walk.”
That
was
when
they
heard
the
sound,
low
and
deep
and
shivery.
Baby
Bran
had
clutched
at
Arya’s
hand.

When
the
spirit
stepped
out
of
the
open
tomb,
pale
white
and
moaning
for
blood,
Sansa
ran
shrieking
for
the
stairs,
and
Bran
wrapped
himself
around
Robb’s
leg,
sobbing.
Arya
stood
her
ground
and
gave
the
spirit
a
punch.
It
was
only
Jon,
covered
with
flour.
“You
stupid,”
she
told
him,
“you
scared
the
baby,”
but
Jon
and
Robb
just
laughed
and
laughed,
and
pretty
soon
Bran
and
Arya
were
laughing
too.

The
memory
made
Arya
smile,
and
after
that
the
darkness
held
no
more
terrors
for
her.
The
stableboy
was
dead,
she’d
killed
him,
and
if
he
jumped
out
at
her
she’d
kill
him
again.
She
was
going
home.
Everything
would
be
better
once
she
was
home
again,
safe
behind
Winterfell’s
grey
granite
walls.

Her
footsteps
sent
soft
echoes
hurrying
ahead
of
her
as
Arya
plunged
deeper
into
the
darkness.

JAIME

The
trumpets
made
a
brazen
blare,
and
cut
the
still
blue
air
of
dusk.
Josmyn
Peckledon
was
on
his
feet
at
once,
scrambling
for
his
master’s
swordbelt.

The
boy
has
good
instincts.
“Outlaws
don’t
blow
trumpets
to
herald
their
arrival,”
Jaime
told
him.
“I
shan’t
need
my
sword.
That
will
be
my
cousin,
the
Warden
of
the
West.”

The
riders
were
dismounting
when
he
emerged
from
his
tent;
half
a
dozen
knights,
and
twoscore
mounted
archers
and
men-at-arms.
“Jaime!”
roared
a
shaggy
man
clad
in
gilded
ringmail
and
a
fox-fur
cloak.
“So
gaunt,
and
all
in
white!
And
bearded
too!”

“This?
Mere
stubble,
against
that
mane
of
yours,
coz.”
Ser
Daven’s
bristling
beard
and
bushy
mustache
grew
into
sidewhiskers
as
thick
as
a
hedgerow,
and
those
into
the
tangled
yellow
thicket
atop
his
head,
matted
down
by
the
helm
he
was
removing.
Somewhere
in
the
midst
of
all
that
hair
lurked
a
pug
nose
and
a
pair
of
lively
hazel
eyes.
“Did
some
outlaw
steal
your
razor?”

“I
vowed
I
would
not
let
my
hair
be
cut
until
my
father
was
avenged.”
For
a
man
who
looked
so
leonine,
Daven
Lannister
sounded
oddly
sheepish.
“The
Young
Wolf
got
to
Karstark
first,
though.
Robbed
me
of
my
vengeance.”
He
handed
his
helm
to
a
squire
and
pushed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
where
the
weight
of
the
steel
had
crushed
it
down.
“I
like
a
bit
of
hair.
The
nights
grow
colder,
and
a
little
foliage
helps
to
keep
your
face
warm.
Aye,
and
Aunt
Genna
always
said
I
had
a
brick
for
a
chin.”
He
clasped
Jaime
by
the
arms.
“We
feared
for
you
after
the
Whispering
Wood.
Heard
Stark’s
direwolf
tore
out
your
throat.”

“Did
you
weep
bitter
tears
for
me,
coz?”

“Half
of
Lannisport
was
mourning.
The
female
half.”
Ser
Daven’s
gaze
went
to
Jaime’s
stump.
“So
it’s
true.
The
bastards
took
your
sword
hand.”

“I
have
a
new
one,
made
of
gold.
There’s
much
to
be
said
for
being
one-handed.
I
drink
less
wine
for
fear
of
spilling
and
am
seldom
inclined
to
scratch
my
arse
at
court.”

“Aye,
there’s
that.
Maybe
I
should
have
mine
off
as
well.”
His
cousin
laughed.
“Was
it
Catelyn
Stark
who
took
it?”

“Vargo
Hoat.”
Where
do
these
tales
come
from?

“The
Qohorik?”
Ser
Daven
spat.
“That’s
for
him
and
all
his
Brave
Companions.
I
told
your
father
I
would
forage
for
him,
but
he
refused
me.
Some
tasks
are
fit
for
lions,
he
said,
but
foraging
is
best
left
for
goats
and
dogs.”

Lord
Tywin’s
very
words,
Jaime
knew;
he
could
almost
hear
his
father’s
voice.
“Come
inside,
coz.
We
need
to
talk.”

Garrett
had
lit
the
braziers,
and
their
glowing
coals
filled
Jaime’s
tent
with
a
ruddy
heat.
Ser
Daven
shrugged
out
of
his
cloak
and
tossed
it
at
Little
Lew.
“You
a
Piper,
boy?”
he
growled.
“You
have
a
runty
look
to
you.”

“I’m
Lewys
Piper,
if
it
please
my
lord.”

“I
beat
your
brother
bloody
in
a
mêlée
once.
The
runty
little
fool
took
offense
when
I
asked
him
if
that
was
his
sister
dancing
naked
on
his
shield.”

“She’s
the
sigil
of
our
House.
We
don’t
have
a
sister.”

“More’s
the
pity.
Your
sigil
has
nice
teats.
What
sort
of
man
hides
behind
a
naked
woman,
though?
Every
time
I
thumped
your
brother’s
shield,
I
felt
unchivalrous.”

“Enough,”
said
Jaime,
laughing.
“Leave
him
be.”
Pia
was
mulling
wine
for
them,
stirring
the
kettle
with
a
spoon.
“I
need
to
know
what
I
can
expect
to
find
at
Riverrun.”

His
cousin
shrugged.
“The
siege
drags
on.
The
Blackfish
sits
inside
the
castle,
we
sit
outside
in
our
camps.
Bloody
boring,
if
you
want
the
truth.”
Ser
Daven
seated
himself
upon
a
camp
stool.
“Tully
ought
to
make
a
sortie,
to
remind
us
all
we’re
still
at
war.
Be
nice
if
he
culled
some
Freys
too.
Ryman,
for
a
start.
The
man’s
drunk
more
oft
than
not.
Oh,
and
Edwyn.
Not
as
thick
as
his
father,
but
as
full
of
hate
as
a
boil’s
full
of
pus.
And
our
own
Ser
Emmon...
no,
Lord
Emmon,
Seven
save
us,
must
not
forget
his
new
title...
our
Lord
of
Riverrun
does
nought
but
try
to
tell
me
how
to
run
the
siege.
He
wants
me
to
take
the
castle
without
damaging
it,
since
it
is
now
his
lordly
seat.”

“Is
that
wine
hot
yet?”
Jaime
asked
Pia.

“Yes,
m’lord.”
The
girl
covered
her
mouth
when
she
spoke.
Peck
served
the
wine
on
a
golden
platter.
Ser
Daven
pulled
off
his
gloves
and
took
a
cup.
“Thank
you,
boy.
Who
might
you
be?”

“Josmyn
Peckledon,
if
it
please
my
lord.”

“Peck
was
a
hero
on
the
Blackwater,”
Jaime
said.
“He
slew
two
knights
and
captured
two
more.”

“You
must
be
more
dangerous
than
you
look,
lad.
Is
that
a
beard,
or
did
you
forget
to
wash
the
dirt
off
your
face?
Stannis
Baratheon’s
wife
has
a
thicker
mustache.
How
old
are
you?”

“Fifteen,
ser.”

Ser
Daven
snorted.
“You
know
the
best
thing
about
heroes,
Jaime?
They
all
die
young
and
leave
more
women
for
the
rest
of
us.”
He
tossed
the
cup
back
to
the
squire.
“Fill
that
full
again,
and
I’ll
call
you
hero
too.
I
have
a
thirst.”

Jaime
lifted
his
own
cup
left-handed
and
took
a
swallow.
The
warmth
spread
through
his
chest.
“You
were
speaking
of
the
Freys
you
wanted
dead.
Ryman,
Edwyn,
Emmon...”

“And
Walder
Rivers,”
Daven
said,
“that
whoreson.
Hates
that
he’s
a
bastard,
and
hates
everyone
who’s
not.
Ser
Perwyn
seems
a
decent
fellow,
though,
might
as
well
spare
him.
The
women
too.
I’m
to
marry
one,
I
hear.
Your
father
might
have
seen
fit
to
consult
with
me
about
this
marriage,
by
the
bye.
My
own
father
was
treating
with
Paxter
Redwyne
before
Oxcross,
did
you
know?
Redwyne
has
a
nicely
dowered
daughter...”

“Desmera?”
Jaime
laughed.
“How
well
do
you
like
freckles?”

“If
my
choice
is
Freys
or
freckles,
well...
half
of
Lord
Walder’s
brood
look
like
stoats.”

“Only
half?
Be
thankful.
I
saw
Lancel’s
bride
at
Darry.”

“Gatehouse
Ami,
gods
be
good.
I
couldn’t
believe
that
Lancel
picked
that
one.
What’s
wrong
with
that
boy?”

“He’s
grown
pious,”
said
Jaime,
“but
it
wasn’t
him
who
did
the
picking.
Lady
Amerei’s
mother
is
a
Darry.
Our
uncle
thought
she’d
help
Lancel
win
the
Darry
smallfolk.”

“How,
by
fucking
them?
You
know
why
they
call
her
Gatehouse
Ami?
She
raises
her
portcullis
for
every
knight
who
happens
by.
Lancel
had
best
find
an
armorer
to
make
him
a
horned
helm.”

“That
won’t
be
necessary.
Our
coz
is
off
to
King’s
Landing
to
take
vows
as
one
of
the
High
Septon’s
swords.”

Ser
Daven
could
not
have
looked
more
astonished
if
Jaime
had
told
him
that
Lancel
had
decided
to
become
a
mummer’s
monkey.
“Not
truly?
You
are
japing
with
me.
Gatehouse
Ami
must
be
more
stoatish
than
I’d
heard
if
she
could
drive
the
boy
to
that.”

When
Jaime
had
taken
his
leave
of
Lady
Amerei,
she
had
been
weeping
softly
at
the
dissolution
of
her
marriage
whilst
letting
Lyle
Crakehall
console
her.
Her
tears
had
not
troubled
him
half
so
much
as
the
hard
looks
on
the
faces
of
her
kin
as
they
stood
about
the
yard.
“I
hope
you
do
not
intend
to
take
vows
as
well,
coz,”
he
said
to
Daven.
“The
Freys
are
prickly
where
marriage
contracts
are
concerned.
I
would
hate
to
disappoint
them
again.”

Ser
Daven
snorted.
“I’ll
wed
and
bed
my
stoat,
never
fear.
I
know
what
happened
to
Robb
Stark.
From
what
Edwyn
tells
me,
though,
I’d
best
pick
one
who
hasn’t
flowered
yet,
or
I’m
like
to
find
that
Black
Walder
has
been
there
first.
I’ll
wager
he’s
had
Gatehouse
Ami,
and
more
than
thrice.
Maybe
that
explains
Lancel’s
godliness,
and
his
father’s
mood.”

“You
have
seen
Ser
Kevan?”

“Aye.
He
passed
here
on
his
way
west.
I
asked
him
to
help
us
take
the
castle,
but
Kevan
would
have
none
of
it.
He
brooded
the
whole
time
he
was
here.
Courteous
enough,
but
chilly.
I
swore
to
him
that
I
never
asked
to
be
made
Warden
of
the
West,
that
the
honor
should
have
gone
to
him,
and
he
declared
that
he
held
no
grudge
against
me,
but
you
would
never
have
known
it
from
his
tone.
He
stayed
three
days
and
hardly
said
three
words
to
me.
Would
that
he’d
remained,
I
could
have
used
his
counsel.
Our
friends
of
Frey
would
not
have
dared
vex
Ser
Kevan
the
way
that
they’ve
been
vexing
me.”

“Tell
me,”
said
Jaime.

“I
would,
but
where
to
begin?
Whilst
I’ve
been
building
rams
and
siege
towers,
Ryman
Frey
has
raised
a
gibbet.
Every
day
at
dawn
he
brings
forth
Edmure
Tully,
drapes
a
noose
around
his
neck,
and
threatens
to
hang
him
unless
the
castle
yields.
The
Blackfish
pays
his
mummer’s
show
no
mind,
so
come
evenfall
Lord
Edmure
is
taken
down
again.
His
wife’s
with
child,
did
you
know?”

He
hadn’t.
“Edmure
bedded
her,
after
the
Red
Wedding?”

“He
was
bedding
her
during
the
Red
Wedding.
Roslin’s
a
pretty
little
thing,
hardly
stoatish
at
all.
And
fond
of
Edmure,
queerly.
Perwyn
tells
me
she’s
praying
for
a
girl.”

Jaime
considered
that
a
moment.
“Once
Edmure’s
son
is
born,
Lord
Walder
will
have
no
more
need
of
Edmure.”

“That’s
how
I
see
it
too.
Our
good-uncle
Emm...
ah,
Lord
Emmon,
that
is...
he
wants
Edmure
hanged
at
once.
The
presence
of
a
Tully
Lord
of
Riverrun
distresses
him
almost
as
much
as
the
prospective
birth
of
yet
another.
Daily
he
beseeches
me
to
make
Ser
Ryman
dangle
Tully,
never
mind
how.
Meanwhile,
I
have
Lord
Gawen
Westerling
tugging
at
my
other
sleeve.
The
Blackfish
has
his
lady
wife
inside
the
castle,
along
with
three
of
his
snot-nosed
whelps.
His
lordship
fears
Tully
will
kill
them
if
the
Freys
hang
Edmure.
One
of
them
is
the
Young
Wolf’s
little
queen.”

Jaime
had
met
Jeyne
Westerling,
he
thought,
though
he
could
not
recall
what
she
looked
like.
She
must
be
fair
indeed,
to
have
been
worth
a
kingdom.
“Ser
Brynden
won’t
kill
children,”
he
assured
his
cousin.
“He’s
not
as
black
a
fish
as
that.”
He
was
beginning
to
grasp
why
Riverrun
had
not
yet
fallen.
“Tell
me
of
your
dispositions,
coz.”

“We
have
the
castle
well
encircled.
Ser
Ryman
and
the
Freys
are
north
of
the
Tumblestone.
South
of
Red
Fork
sits
Lord
Emmon,
with
Ser
Forley
Prester
and
with
what
remains
of
your
old
host,
plus
the
river
lords
who
came
over
to
us
after
the
Red
Wedding.
A
sullen
lot,
I
don’t
mind
saying.
Good
for
sulking
in
their
tents,
but
not
much
more.
Mine
own
camp
is
between
the
rivers,
facing
the
moat
and
Riverrun’s
main
gates.
We’ve
thrown
a
boom
across
the
Red
Fork,
downstream
of
the
castle.
Manfryd
Yew
and
Raynard
Ruttiger
have
charge
of
its
defense,
so
no
one
can
escape
by
boat.
I
gave
them
nets
as
well,
to
fish.
It
helps
keep
us
fed.”

“Can
we
starve
the
castle
out?”

Ser
Daven
shook
his
head.
“The
Blackfish
expelled
all
the
useless
mouths
from
Riverrun
and
picked
this
country
clean.
He
has
enough
stores
to
keep
man
and
horse
alive
for
two
full
years.”

“And
how
well
are
we
provisioned?”

“So
long
as
there
are
fish
in
the
rivers,
we
won’t
starve,
though
I
don’t
know
how
we’re
going
to
feed
the
horses.
The
Freys
are
hauling
food
and
fodder
down
from
the
Twins,
but
Ser
Ryman
claims
he
does
not
have
enough
to
share,
so
we
must
forage
for
ourselves.
Half
the
men
I
send
off
to
look
for
food
do
not
return.
Some
are
deserting.
Others
we
find
ripening
under
trees,
with
ropes
about
their
necks.”

“We
came
on
some,
the
day
before
last,”
said
Jaime.
Addam
Marbrand’s
scouts
had
found
them,
hanging
black-faced
beneath
a
crabapple
tree.
The
corpses
had
been
stripped
naked,
and
each
man
had
a
crabapple
shoved
between
his
teeth.
None
bore
any
wounds;
plainly,
they
had
yielded.
Strongboar
had
grown
furious
at
that,
vowing
bloody
vengeance
on
the
heads
of
any
men
who
would
truss
up
warriors
to
die
like
suckling
pigs.

“It
might
have
been
outlaws,”
Ser
Daven
said,
when
Jaime
told
the
tale,
“or
not.
There
are
still
bands
of
northmen
about.
And
these
Lords
of
the
Trident
may
have
bent
their
knees,
but
methinks
their
hearts
are
still...
wolfish.”

Jaime
glanced
at
his
two
younger
squires,
who
were
hovering
near
the
braziers
pretending
not
to
listen.
Lewys
Piper
and
Garrett
Paege
were
both
the
sons
of
river
lords.
He
had
grown
fond
of
both
of
them
and
would
hate
to
have
to
give
them
to
Ser
Ilyn.
“The
ropes
suggest
Dondarrion
to
me.”

“Your
lightning
lord’s
not
the
only
man
who
knows
how
to
tie
a
noose.
Don’t
get
me
started
on
Lord
Beric.
He’s
here,
he’s
there,
he’s
everywhere,
but
when
you
send
men
after
him,
he
melts
away
like
dew.
The
river
lords
are
helping
him,
never
doubt
it.
A
bloody
marcher
lord,
if
you
can
believe
it.
One
day
you
hear
the
man
is
dead,
the
next
they’re
saying
how
he
can’t
be
killed.”
Ser
Daven
put
his
wine
cup
down.
“My
scouts
report
fires
in
the
high
places
at
night.
Signal
fires,
they
think...
as
if
there
were
a
ring
of
watchers
all
around
us.
And
there
are
fires
in
the
villages
as
well.
Some
new
god...”

No,
an
old
one.
“Thoros
is
with
Dondarrion,
the
fat
Myrish
priest
who
used
to
drink
with
Robert.”
His
golden
hand
was
on
the
table.
Jaime
touched
it
and
watched
the
gold
glimmer
in
the
sullen
light
of
the
braziers.
“We’ll
deal
with
Dondarrion
if
we
have
to,
but
the
Blackfish
must
come
first.
He
has
to
know
his
cause
is
hopeless.
Have
you
tried
to
treat
with
him?”

“Ser
Ryman
did.
Rode
up
to
the
castle
gates
half-drunk
and
blustering,
making
threats.
The
Blackfish
appeared
on
the
ramparts
long
enough
to
say
that
he
would
not
waste
fair
words
on
foul
men.
Then
he
put
an
arrow
in
the
rump
of
Ryman’s
palfrey.
The
horse
reared,
Frey
fell
into
the
mud,
and
I
laughed
so
hard
I
almost
pissed
myself.
If
it
had
been
me
inside
the
castle,
I
would
have
put
that
arrow
through
Ryman’s
lying
throat.”

“I’ll
wear
a
gorget
when
I
treat
with
them,”
said
Jaime,
with
a
half
smile.
“I
mean
to
offer
him
generous
terms.”
If
he
could
end
this
siege
without
bloodshed,
then
it
could
not
be
said
that
he
had
taken
up
arms
against
House
Tully.

“You
are
welcome
to
try,
my
lord,
but
I
doubt
that
words
will
win
the
day.
We
need
to
storm
the
castle.”

There
had
been
a
time,
not
so
long
ago,
when
Jaime
would
doubtless
have
urged
the
same
course.
He
knew
he
could
not
sit
here
for
two
years
to
starve
the
Blackfish
out.
“Whatever
we
do
needs
to
be
done
quickly,”
he
told
Ser
Daven.
“My
place
is
back
at
King’s
Landing,
with
the
king.”

“Aye,”
his
cousin
said.
“I
don’t
doubt
your
sister
needs
you.
Why
did
she
send
off
Kevan?
I
thought
she’d
make
him
Hand.”

“He
would
not
take
it.”
He
was
not
as
blind
as
I
was.

“Kevan
should
be
the
Warden
of
the
West.
Or
you.
It’s
not
that
I’m
not
grateful
for
the
honor,
mind
you,
but
our
uncle’s
twice
my
age
and
has
more
experience
of
command.
I
hope
he
knows
I
never
asked
for
this.”

“He
knows.”

“How
is
Cersei?
As
beautiful
as
ever?”

“Radiant.”
Fickle.
“Golden.”
False
as
fool’s
gold.
Last
night
he
dreamed
he’d
found
her
fucking
Moon
Boy.
He’d
killed
the
fool
and
smashed
his
sister’s
teeth
to
splinters
with
his
golden
hand,
just
as
Gregor
Clegane
had
done
to
poor
Pia.
In
his
dreams
Jaime
always
had
two
hands;
one
was
made
of
gold,
but
it
worked
just
like
the
other.
“The
sooner
we
are
done
with
Riverrun,
the
sooner
I’ll
be
back
at
Cersei’s
side.”
What
Jaime
would
do
then
he
did
not
know.

He
talked
with
his
cousin
for
another
hour
before
the
Warden
of
the
West
finally
took
his
leave.
When
he
was
gone,
Jaime
donned
his
gold
hand
and
brown
cloak
to
walk
amongst
the
tents.

If
truth
be
told,
he
liked
this
life.
He
felt
more
comfortable
amongst
soldiers
in
the
field
than
he
ever
had
at
court.
And
his
men
seemed
comfortable
with
him
as
well.
At
one
cookfire
three
crossbowmen
offered
him
a
share
of
a
hare
they’d
caught.
At
another
a
young
knight
asked
his
counsel
on
the
best
way
to
defend
against
a
warhammer.
Down
beside
the
river,
he
watched
two
washerwomen
jousting
in
the
shallows,
mounted
on
the
shoulders
of
a
pair
of
men-at-arms.
The
girls
were
half-drunk
and
half-naked,
laughing
and
snapping
rolled-up
cloaks
at
one
another
as
a
dozen
other
men
urged
them
on.
Jaime
bet
a
copper
star
on
the
blond
girl
riding
Raff
the
Sweetling,
and
lost
it
when
the
two
of
them
went
down
splashing
amongst
the
reeds.

Across
the
river
wolves
were
howling,
and
the
wind
was
gusting
through
a
stand
of
willows,
making
their
branches
writhe
and
whisper.
Jaime
found
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
alone
outside
his
tent,
honing
his
greatsword
with
a
whetstone.
“Come,”
he
said,
and
the
silent
knight
rose,
smiling
thinly.
He
enjoys
this,
he
realized.
It
pleases
him
to
humiliate
me
nightly.
It
might
please
him
even
more
to
kill
me.
He
liked
to
believe
that
he
was
getting
better,
but
the
improvement
was
slow
and
not
without
cost.
Underneath
his
steel
and
wool
and
boiled
leather
Jaime
Lannister
was
a
tapestry
of
cuts
and
scabs
and
bruises.

A
sentry
challenged
them
as
they
led
their
horses
from
the
camp.
Jaime
clapped
the
man’s
shoulder
with
his
golden
hand.
“Stay
vigilant.
There
are
wolves
about.”
They
rode
back
along
the
Red
Fork
to
the
ruins
of
a
burned
village
they
had
passed
that
afternoon.
It
was
there
they
danced
their
midnight
dance,
amongst
blackened
stones
and
old
cold
cinders.
For
a
little
while
Jaime
had
the
better
of
it.
Perhaps
his
old
skill
was
coming
back,
he
allowed
himself
to
think.
Perhaps
tonight
it
would
be
Payne
who
went
to
sleep
bruised
and
bloody.

It
was
as
if
Ser
Ilyn
heard
his
thoughts.
He
parried
Jaime’s
last
cut
lazily
and
launched
a
counterattack
that
drove
Jaime
back
into
the
river,
where
his
boot
slipped
out
from
under
him
in
the
mud.
He
ended
on
his
knees,
with
the
silent
knight’s
sword
at
his
throat
and
his
own
lost
in
the
reeds.
In
the
moonlight
the
pockmarks
on
Payne’s
face
were
large
as
craters.
He
made
that
clacking
sound
that
might
have
been
a
laugh
and
drew
his
sword
up
Jaime’s
throat
till
the
point
came
to
rest
between
his
lips.
Only
then
did
he
step
back
and
sheathe
his
steel.

I
would
have
done
better
to
challenge
Raff
the
Sweetling,
with
a
whore
upon
my
back,
Jaime
thought
as
he
shook
mud
off
his
gilded
hand.
Part
of
him
wanted
to
tear
the
thing
off
and
fling
it
in
the
river.
It
was
good
for
nothing,
and
the
left
was
not
much
better.
Ser
Ilyn
had
gone
back
to
the
horses,
leaving
him
to
find
his
own
feet.
At
least
I
still
have
two
of
those.

The
last
day
of
their
journey
was
cold
and
gusty.
The
wind
rattled
amongst
the
branches
in
the
bare
brown
woods
and
made
the
river
reeds
bow
low
along
the
Red
Fork.
Even
mantled
in
the
winter
wool
of
the
Kingsguard,
Jaime
could
feel
the
iron
teeth
of
that
wind
as
he
rode
beside
his
cousin
Daven.
It
was
late
afternoon
when
they
sighted
Riverrun,
rising
from
the
narrow
point
where
the
Tumblestone
joined
the
Red
Fork.
The
Tully
castle
looked
like
a
great
stone
ship
with
its
prow
pointed
downriver.
Its
sandstone
walls
were
drenched
in
red-gold
light,
and
seemed
higher
and
thicker
than
Jaime
had
remembered.
This
nut
will
not
crack
easily,
he
thought
gloomily.
If
the
Blackfish
would
not
listen,
he
would
have
no
choice
but
to
break
the
vow
he’d
made
to
Catelyn
Stark.
The
vow
he’d
sworn
his
king
came
first.

The
boom
across
the
river
and
the
three
great
camps
of
the
besieging
army
were
just
as
his
cousin
had
described.
Ser
Ryman
Frey’s
encampment
north
of
the
Tumblestone
was
the
largest,
and
the
most
disorderly.
A
great
grey
gallows
loomed
above
the
tents,
as
tall
as
any
trebuchet.
On
it
stood
a
solitary
figure
with
a
rope
about
his
neck.
Edmure
Tully.
Jaime
felt
a
stab
of
pity.
To
keep
him
standing
there
day
after
day,
with
that
noose
around
his
neck...
better
to
have
his
head
off
and
be
done
with
it.

Behind
the
gallows,
tents
and
cookfires
spread
out
in
ragged
disarray.
The
Frey
lordlings
and
their
knights
had
raised
their
pavilions
comfortably
upstream
of
the
latrine
trenches;
downstream
were
muddy
hovels,
wayns,
and
oxcarts.
“Ser
Ryman
don’t
want
his
boys
getting
bored,
so
he
gives
them
whores
and
cockfights
and
boar
baiting,”
Ser
Daven
said.
“He’s
even
got
himself
a
bloody
singer.
Our
aunt
brought
Whitesmile
Wat
from
Lannisport,
if
you
can
believe
it,
so
Ryman
had
to
have
a
singer
too.
Couldn’t
we
just
dam
the
river
and
drown
the
whole
lot
of
them,
coz?”

Jaime
could
see
archers
moving
behind
the
merlons
on
the
castle
ramparts.
Above
them
streamed
the
banners
of
House
Tully,
the
silver
trout
defiant
on
its
striped
field
of
red
and
blue.
But
the
highest
tower
flew
a
different
flag;
a
long
white
standard
emblazoned
with
the
direwolf
of
Stark.
“The
first
time
I
saw
Riverrun,
I
was
a
squire
green
as
summer
grass,”
Jaime
told
his
cousin.
“Old
Sumner
Crakehall
sent
me
to
deliver
a
message,
one
he
swore
could
not
be
entrusted
to
a
raven.
Lord
Hoster
kept
me
for
a
fortnight
whilst
mulling
his
reply,
and
sat
me
beside
his
daughter
Lysa
at
every
meal.”

“Small
wonder
you
took
the
white.
I’d
have
done
the
same.”

“Oh,
Lysa
was
not
so
fearsome
as
all
that.”
She
had
been
a
pretty
girl,
in
truth;
dimpled
and
delicate,
with
long
auburn
hair.
Timid,
though.
Prone
to
tongue-tied
silences
and
fits
of
giggles,
with
none
of
Cersei’s
fire.
Her
older
sister
had
seemed
more
interesting,
though
Catelyn
was
promised
to
some
northern
boy,
the
heir
of
Winterfell...
but
at
that
age,
no
girl
interested
Jaime
half
so
much
as
Hoster’s
famous
brother,
who
had
won
renown
fighting
the
Ninepenny
Kings
upon
the
Stepstones.
At
table
he
had
ignored
poor
Lysa,
whilst
pressing
Brynden
Tully
for
tales
of
Maelys
the
Monstrous
and
the
Ebon
Prince.
Ser
Brynden
was
younger
then
than
I
am
now,
Jaime
reflected,
and
I
was
younger
than
Peck.

The
nearest
ford
across
the
Red
Fork
was
upstream
of
the
castle.
To
reach
Ser
Daven’s
camp
they
had
to
ride
through
Emmon
Frey’s,
past
the
pavilions
of
the
river
lords
who
had
bent
their
knees
and
been
accepted
back
into
the
king’s
peace.
Jaime
noted
the
banners
of
Lychester
and
Vance,
of
Roote
and
Goodbrook,
the
acorns
of
House
Smallford
and
Lord
Piper’s
dancing
maiden,
but
the
banners
he
did
not
see
gave
him
pause.
The
silver
eagle
of
Mallister
was
nowhere
in
evidence;
nor
the
red
horse
of
Bracken,
the
willow
of
the
Rygers,
the
twining
snakes
of
Paege.
Though
all
had
renewed
their
fealty
to
the
Iron
Throne,
none
had
come
to
join
the
siege.
The
Brackens
were
fighting
the
Blackwoods,
Jaime
knew,
which
accounted
for
their
absence,
but
as
for
the
rest...

Our
new
friends
are
no
friends
at
all.
Their
loyalty
goes
no
deeper
than
their
skins.
Riverrun
had
to
be
taken,
and
soon.
The
longer
the
siege
dragged
on,
the
more
it
would
hearten
other
recalcitrants,
like
Tytos
Blackwood.

At
the
ford,
Ser
Kennos
of
Kayce
blew
the
Horn
of
Herrock.
That
should
bring
the
Blackfish
to
the
battlements.
Ser
Hugo
and
Ser
Dermot
led
Jaime’s
way
across
the
river,
splashing
through
the
muddy
red-brown
waters
with
the
white
standard
of
the
Kingsguard
and
Tommen’s
stag
and
lion
streaming
in
the
wind.
The
rest
of
the
column
followed
hard
behind
them.

The
Lannister
camp
rang
to
the
sound
of
wooden
hammers
where
a
new
siege
tower
was
rising.
Two
other
towers
stood
completed,
half-covered
with
raw
horsehide.
Between
them
sat
a
rolling
ram;
a
tree
trunk
with
a
fire-hardened
point
suspended
on
chains
beneath
a
wooden
roof.
My
coz
has
not
been
idle,
it
would
seem.

“My
lord,”
Peck
asked,
“where
do
you
want
your
tent?”

“There,
upon
that
rise.”
He
pointed
with
his
golden
hand,
though
it
was
not
well
suited
to
that
task.
“Baggage
there,
horse
lines
there.
We’ll
use
the
latrines
my
cousin
has
so
kindly
dug
for
us.
Ser
Addam,
inspect
our
perimeter
with
an
eye
for
any
weaknesses.”
Jaime
did
not
anticipate
an
attack,
but
he
had
not
anticipated
the
Whispering
Wood
either.

“Shall
I
summon
the
stoats
for
a
war
council?”
Daven
asked.

“Not
until
I’ve
spoken
to
the
Blackfish.”
Jaime
beckoned
to
Beardless
Jon
Bettley.
“Shake
out
a
peace
banner
and
bear
a
message
to
the
castle.
Inform
Ser
Brynden
Tully
that
I
would
have
words
with
him,
at
first
light
on
the
morrow.
I
will
come
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
and
meet
him
on
his
drawbridge.”

Peck
looked
alarmed.
“My
lord,
the
bowmen
could...”

“They
won’t.”
Jaime
dismounted.
“Raise
my
tent
and
plant
my
standards.”
And
we’ll
see
who
comes
running,
and
how
quickly.

It
did
not
require
long.
Pia
was
fussing
at
a
brazier,
trying
to
light
the
coals.
Peck
went
to
help
her.
Of
late,
Jaime
oft
went
to
sleep
to
the
sound
of
them
fucking
in
a
corner
of
the
tent.
As
Garrett
was
undoing
the
clasps
on
Jaime’s
greaves,
the
tent
flapped
open.
“Here
at
last,
are
you?”
boomed
his
aunt.
She
filled
the
door,
with
her
Frey
husband
peering
out
from
behind
her.
“Past
time.
Have
you
no
hug
for
your
old
fat
aunt?”
She
held
out
her
arms
and
left
him
no
choice
but
to
embrace
her.

Genna
Lannister
had
been
a
shapely
woman
in
her
youth,
always
threatening
to
overflow
her
bodice.
Now
the
only
shape
she
had
was
square.
Her
face
was
broad
and
smooth,
her
neck
a
thick
pink
pillar,
her
bosom
enormous.
She
carried
enough
flesh
to
make
two
of
her
husband.
Jaime
hugged
her
dutifully
and
waited
for
her
to
pinch
his
ear.
She
had
been
pinching
his
ear
for
as
long
as
he
could
remember,
but
today
she
forbore.
Instead,
she
planted
soft
and
sloppy
kisses
on
his
cheeks.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
loss.”

“I
had
a
new
hand
made,
of
gold.”
He
showed
her.

“Very
nice.
Will
they
make
you
a
gold
father
too?”
Lady
Genna’s
voice
was
sharp.
“Tywin
was
the
loss
I
meant.”

“A
man
such
as
Tywin
Lannister
comes
but
once
in
a
thousand
years,”
declared
her
husband.
Emmon
Frey
was
a
fretful
man
with
nervous
hands.
He
might
have
weighed
ten
stone...
but
only
wet,
and
clad
in
mail.
He
was
a
weed
in
wool,
with
no
chin
to
speak
of,
a
flaw
that
the
prominence
of
the
apple
in
his
throat
made
even
more
absurd.
Half
his
hair
had
been
gone
before
he
turned
thirty.
Now
he
was
sixty
and
only
a
few
white
wisps
remained.

“Some
queer
tales
have
been
reaching
us
of
late,”
Lady
Genna
said,
after
Jaime
dismissed
Pia
and
his
squires.
“A
woman
hardly
knows
what
to
believe.
Can
it
be
true
that
Tyrion
slew
Tywin?
Or
is
that
some
calumny
your
sister
put
about?”

“It’s
true
enough.”
The
weight
of
his
golden
hand
had
grown
irksome.
He
fumbled
at
the
straps
that
secured
it
to
his
wrist.

“For
a
son
to
raise
his
hand
against
a
father,”
Ser
Emmon
said.
“Monstrous.
These
are
dark
days
in
Westeros.
I
fear
for
us
all
with
Lord
Tywin
gone.”

“You
feared
for
us
all
when
he
was
here.”
Genna
settled
her
ample
rump
upon
a
camp
stool,
which
creaked
alarmingly
beneath
her
weight.
“Nephew,
speak
to
us
of
our
son
Cleos
and
the
manner
of
his
death.”

Jaime
undid
the
last
fastening
and
set
his
hand
aside.
“We
were
set
upon
by
outlaws.
Ser
Cleos
scattered
them,
but
it
cost
his
life.”
The
lie
came
easy;
he
could
see
that
it
pleased
them.

“The
boy
had
courage,
I
always
said
so.
It
was
in
his
blood.”
A
pinkish
froth
glistened
on
Ser
Emmon’s
lips
when
he
spoke,
courtesy
of
the
sourleaf
he
liked
to
chew.

“His
bones
should
be
interred
beneath
the
Rock,
in
the
Hall
of
Heroes,”
Lady
Genna
declared.
“Where
was
he
laid
to
rest?”

Nowhere.
The
Bloody
Mummers
stripped
his
corpse
and
left
his
flesh
to
feast
the
carrion
crows.
“Beside
a
stream,”
he
lied.
“When
this
war
is
done,
I
will
find
the
place
and
send
him
home.”
Bones
were
bones;
these
days,
nothing
was
easier
to
come
by.

“This
war...”
Lord
Emmon
cleared
his
throat,
the
apple
in
his
throat
moving
up
and
down.
“You
will
have
seen
the
siege
machines.
Rams,
treb-uchets,
towers.
It
will
not
serve,
Jaime.
Daven
means
to
break
my
walls,
smash
in
my
gates.
He
talks
of
burning
pitch,
of
setting
the
castle
afire.
My
castle.”
He
reached
up
one
sleeve,
brought
out
a
parchment,
and
thrust
it
at
Jaime’s
face.
“I
have
the
decree.
Signed
by
the
king,
by
Tommen,
see,
the
royal
seal,
the
stag
and
lion.
I
am
the
lawful
lord
of
Riverrun,
and
I
will
not
have
it
reduced
to
a
smoking
ruin.”

“Oh,
put
that
fool
thing
away,”
his
wife
snapped.
“So
long
as
the
Blackfish
sits
inside
Riverrun
you
can
wipe
your
arse
with
that
paper
for
all
the
good
it
does
us.”
Though
she
had
been
a
Frey
for
fifty
years,
Lady
Genna
remained
very
much
a
Lannister.
Quite
a
lot
of
Lannister.
“Jaime
will
deliver
you
the
castle.”

“To
be
sure,”
Lord
Emmon
said.
“Ser
Jaime,
your
lord
father’s
faith
in
me
was
well
placed,
you
shall
see.
I
mean
to
be
firm
but
fair
with
my
new
vassals.
Blackwood
and
Bracken,
Jason
Mallister,
Vance
and
Piper,
they
shall
learn
that
they
have
a
just
overlord
in
Emmon
Frey.
My
father
as
well,
yes.
He
is
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing,
but
I
am
the
Lord
of
Riverrun.
A
son
has
a
duty
to
obey
his
father,
true,
but
a
bannerman
must
obey
his
overlord.”

Oh,
gods
be
good.
“You
are
not
his
overlord,
ser.
Read
your
parchment.
You
were
granted
Riverrun
with
its
lands
and
incomes,
no
more.
Petyr
Baelish
is
the
Lord
Paramount
of
the
Trident.
Riverrun
will
be
subject
to
the
rule
of
Harrenhal.”

That
did
not
please
Lord
Emmon.
“Harrenhal
is
a
ruin,
haunted
and
accursed,”
he
objected,
“and
Baelish...
the
man
is
a
coin
counter,
no
proper
lord,
his
birth...”

“If
you
are
unhappy
with
the
arrangements,
go
to
King’s
Landing
and
take
it
up
with
my
sweet
sister.”
Cersei
would
devour
Emmon
Frey
and
pick
her
teeth
with
his
bones,
he
did
not
doubt.
That
is,
if
she’s
not
too
busy
fucking
Osmund
Kettleblack.

Lady
Genna
gave
a
snort.
“There
is
no
need
to
trouble
Her
Grace
with
such
nonsense.
Emm,
why
don’t
you
step
outside
and
have
a
breath
of
air?”

“A
breath
of
air?”

“Or
a
good
long
piss,
if
you
prefer.
My
nephew
and
I
have
family
matters
to
discuss.”

Lord
Emmon
flushed.
“Yes,
it
is
warm
in
here.
I
will
wait
outside,
my
lady.
Ser.”
His
lordship
rolled
up
his
parchment,
sketched
a
bow
toward
Jaime,
and
tottered
from
the
tent.

It
was
hard
not
to
feel
contemptuous
of
Emmon
Frey.
He
had
arrived
at
Casterly
Rock
in
his
fourteenth
year
to
wed
a
lioness
half
his
age.
Tyrion
used
to
say
that
Lord
Tywin
had
given
him
a
nervous
belly
for
a
wedding
gift.
Genna
has
played
her
part
as
well.
Jaime
remembered
many
a
feast
where
Emmon
sat
poking
at
his
food
sullenly
whilst
his
wife
made
ribald
jests
with
whatever
household
knight
had
been
seated
to
her
left,
their
conversations
punctuated
by
loud
bursts
of
laughter.
She
gave
Frey
four
sons,
to
be
sure.
At
least
she
says
they
are
his.
No
one
in
Casterly
Rock
had
the
courage
to
suggest
otherwise,
least
of
all
Ser
Emmon.

No
sooner
was
he
gone
than
his
lady
wife
rolled
her
eyes.
“My
lord
and
master.
What
was
your
father
thinking,
to
name
him
Lord
of
Riverrun?”

“I
imagine
he
was
thinking
of
your
sons.”

“I
think
of
them
as
well.
Emm
will
make
a
wretched
lord.
Ty
may
do
better,
if
he
has
the
sense
to
learn
from
me
and
not
his
father.”
She
looked
about
the
tent.
“Do
you
have
wine?”

Jaime
found
a
flagon
and
poured
for
her,
one-handed.
“Why
are
you
here,
my
lady?
You
should
have
remained
at
Casterly
Rock
until
the
fighting’s
done.”

“Once
Emm
heard
he
was
a
lord,
he
had
to
come
at
once
to
claim
his
seat.”
Lady
Genna
took
a
drink
and
wiped
her
mouth
on
her
sleeve.
“Your
father
should
have
granted
us
Darry.
Cleos
married
one
of
the
plowman’s
daughters,
you
will
recall.
His
grieving
widow
is
furious
that
her
sons
were
not
granted
her
lord
father’s
lands.
Gatehouse
Ami
is
Darry
only
on
her
mother’s
side.
My
good-daughter
Jeyne
is
her
aunt,
a
full
sister
to
Lady
Mariya.”

“A
younger
sister,”
Jaime
reminded
her,
“and
Ty
will
have
Riverrun,
a
greater
prize
than
Darry.”

“A
poisoned
prize.
House
Darry
is
extinguished
in
the
male
line,
House
Tully
is
not.
That
muttonhead
Ser
Ryman
puts
a
noose
round
Edmure’s
neck,
but
will
not
hang
him.
And
Roslin
Frey
has
a
trout
growing
in
her
belly.
My
grandsons
will
never
be
secure
in
Riverrun
so
long
as
any
Tully
heir
remains
alive.”

She
was
not
wrong,
Jaime
knew.
“If
Roslin
has
a
girl—”

“—she
can
wed
Ty,
provided
old
Lord
Walder
will
consent.
Yes,
I’ve
thought
of
that.
A
boy
is
just
as
likely,
though,
and
his
little
cock
would
cloud
the
issue.
And
if
Ser
Brynden
should
survive
this
siege,
he
might
be
inclined
to
claim
Riverrun
in
his
own
name...
or
in
the
name
of
young
Robert
Arryn.”

Jaime
remembered
little
Robert
from
King’s
Landing,
still
sucking
on
his
mother’s
teats
at
four.
“Arryn
won’t
live
long
enough
to
breed.
And
why
should
the
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
need
Riverrun?”

“Why
does
a
man
with
one
pot
of
gold
need
another?
Men
are
greedy.
Tywin
should
have
granted
Riverrun
to
Kevan
and
Darry
to
Emm.
I
would
have
told
him
so
if
he
had
troubled
to
ask
me,
but
when
did
your
father
ever
consult
with
anyone
but
Kevan?”
She
sighed
deeply.
“I
do
not
blame
Kevan
for
wanting
the
safer
seat
for
his
own
boy,
mind
you.
I
know
him
too
well.”

“What
Kevan
wants
and
what
Lancel
wants
appear
to
be
two
different
things.”
He
told
her
of
Lancel’s
decision
to
renounce
wife
and
lands
and
lordship
to
fight
for
the
Holy
Faith.
“If
you
still
want
Darry,
write
to
Cersei
and
make
your
case.”

Lady
Genna
waved
her
cup
in
dismissal.
“No,
that
horse
has
left
the
yard.
Emm
has
it
in
his
pointed
head
that
he
will
rule
the
riverlands.
And
Lancel...
I
suppose
we
should
have
seen
this
coming
from
afar.
A
life
protecting
the
High
Septon
is
not
so
different
from
a
life
protecting
the
king,
after
all.
Kevan
will
be
wroth,
I
fear.
As
wroth
as
Tywin
was
when
you
got
it
in
your
head
to
take
the
white.
At
least
Kevan
still
has
Martyn
for
an
heir.
He
can
marry
him
to
Gatehouse
Ami
in
Lancel’s
place.
Seven
save
us
all.”
His
aunt
gave
a
sigh.
“And
speaking
of
the
Seven,
why
would
Cersei
permit
the
Faith
to
arm
again?”

Jaime
shrugged.
“I
am
certain
she
had
reasons.”

“Reasons?”
Lady
Genna
made
a
rude
noise.
“They
had
best
be
good
reasons.
The
Swords
and
Stars
troubled
even
the
Targaryens.
The
Conqueror
himself
tread
carefully
with
the
Faith,
so
they
would
not
oppose
him.
And
when
Aegon
died
and
the
lords
rose
up
against
his
sons,
both
orders
were
in
the
thick
of
that
rebellion.
The
more
pious
lords
supported
them,
and
many
of
the
smallfolk.
King
Maegor
finally
had
to
put
a
bounty
on
them.
He
paid
a
dragon
for
the
head
of
any
unrepentant
Warrior’s
Son,
and
a
silver
stag
for
the
scalp
of
a
Poor
Fellow,
if
I
recall
my
history.
Thousands
were
slain,
but
nigh
as
many
still
roamed
the
realm,
defiant,
until
the
Iron
Throne
slew
Maegor
and
King
Jaehaerys
agreed
to
pardon
all
those
who
would
set
aside
their
swords.”

“I’d
forgotten
most
of
that,”
Jaime
confessed.

“You
and
your
sister
both.”
She
took
another
swallow
of
her
wine.
“Is
it
true
that
Tywin
was
smiling
on
his
bier?”

“He
was
rotting
on
his
bier.
It
made
his
mouth
twist.”

“Was
that
all
it
was?”
That
seemed
to
sadden
her.
“Men
say
that
Tywin
never
smiled,
but
he
smiled
when
he
wed
your
mother,
and
when
Aerys
made
him
Hand.
When
Tarbeck
Hall
came
crashing
down
on
Lady
Ellyn,
that
scheming
bitch,
Tyg
claimed
he
smiled
then.
And
he
smiled
at
your
birth,
Jaime,
I
saw
that
with
mine
own
eyes.
You
and
Cersei,
pink
and
perfect,
as
alike
as
two
peas
in
a
pod...
well,
except
between
the
legs.
What
lungs
you
had!”

“Hear
us
roar.”
Jaime
grinned.
“Next
you’ll
be
telling
me
how
much
he
liked
to
laugh.”

“No.
Tywin
mistrusted
laughter.
He
heard
too
many
people
laughing
at
your
grandsire.”
She
frowned.
“I
promise
you,
this
mummer’s
farce
of
a
siege
would
not
have
amused
him.
How
do
you
mean
to
end
it,
now
that
you’re
here?”

“Treat
with
the
Blackfish.”

“That
won’t
work.”

“I
mean
to
offer
him
good
terms.”

“Terms
require
trust.
The
Freys
murdered
guests
beneath
their
roof,
and
you,
well...
I
mean
no
offense,
my
love,
but
you
did
kill
a
certain
king
you
had
sworn
to
protect.”

“And
I’ll
kill
the
Blackfish
if
he
does
not
yield.”
His
tone
was
harsher
than
he’d
intended,
but
he
was
in
no
mood
for
having
Aerys
Targaryen
thrown
in
his
face.

“How,
with
your
tongue?”
Her
voice
was
scornful.
“I
may
be
an
old
fat
woman,
but
I
do
not
have
cheese
between
my
ears,
Jaime.
Neither
does
the
Blackfish.
Empty
threats
won’t
daunt
him.”

“What
would
you
counsel?”

She
gave
a
ponderous
shrug.
“Emm
wants
Edmure’s
head
off.
For
once,
he
may
be
right.
Ser
Ryman
has
made
us
a
laughingstock
with
that
gibbet
of
his.
You
need
to
show
Ser
Brynden
that
your
threats
have
teeth.”

“Killing
Edmure
might
harden
Ser
Brynden’s
resolve.”

“Resolve
is
one
thing
Brynden
Blackfish
never
lacked
for.
Hoster
Tully
could
have
told
you
that.”
Lady
Genna
finished
her
wine.
“Well,
I
would
never
presume
to
tell
you
how
to
fight
a
war.
I
know
my
place...
unlike
your
sister.
Is
it
true
that
Cersei
burned
the
Red
Keep?”

“Only
the
Tower
of
the
Hand.”

His
aunt
rolled
her
eyes.
“She
would
have
done
better
to
leave
the
tower
and
burn
her
Hand.
Harys
Swyft?
If
ever
a
man
deserved
his
arms,
it
is
Ser
Harys.
And
Gyles
Rosby,
Seven
save
us,
I
thought
he
died
years
ago.
Merryweather...
your
father
used
to
call
his
grandsire
‘the
Chuckler,’
I’ll
have
you
know.
Tywin
claimed
the
only
thing
Merryweather
was
good
for
was
chuckling
at
the
king’s
witticisms.
His
lordship
chuckled
himself
right
into
exile,
as
I
recall.
Cersei
has
put
some
bastard
on
the
council
too,
and
a
kettle
in
the
Kingsguard.
She
has
the
Faith
arming
and
the
Braavosi
calling
in
loans
all
over
Westeros.
None
of
which
would
be
happening
if
she’d
had
the
simple
sense
to
make
your
uncle
the
King’s
Hand.”

“Ser
Kevan
refused
the
office.”

“So
he
said.
He
did
not
say
why.
There
was
much
he
did
not
say.
Would
not
say.”
Lady
Genna
made
a
face.
“Kevan
always
did
what
was
asked
of
him.
It
is
not
like
him
to
turn
away
from
any
duty.
Something
is
awry
here,
I
can
smell
it.”

“He
said
that
he
was
tired.”
He
knows,
Cersei
had
said,
as
they
stood
above
their
father’s
corpse.
He
knows
about
us.

“Tired?”
His
aunt
pursed
her
lips.
“I
suppose
he
has
a
right
to
be.
It
has
been
hard
for
Kevan,
living
all
his
life
in
Tywin’s
shadow.
It
was
hard
for
all
my
brothers.
That
shadow
Tywin
cast
was
long
and
black,
and
each
of
them
had
to
struggle
to
find
a
little
sun.
Tygett
tried
to
be
his
own
man,
but
he
could
never
match
your
father,
and
that
just
made
him
angrier
as
the
years
went
by.
Gerion
made
japes.
Better
to
mock
the
game
than
to
play
and
lose.
But
Kevan
saw
how
things
stood
early
on,
so
he
made
himself
a
place
by
your
father’s
side.”

“And
you?”
Jaime
asked
her.

“It
was
not
a
game
for
girls.
I
was
my
father’s
precious
princess...
and
Tywin’s
too,
until
I
disappointed
him.
My
brother
never
learned
to
like
the
taste
of
disappointment.”
She
pushed
herself
to
her
feet.
“I’ve
said
what
I
came
to
say,
I
shan’t
take
any
more
of
your
time.
Do
what
Tywin
would
have
done.”

“Did
you
love
him?”
Jaime
heard
himself
ask.

His
aunt
looked
at
him
strangely.
“I
was
seven
when
Walder
Frey
persuaded
my
lord
father
to
give
my
hand
to
Emm.
His
second
son,
not
even
his
heir.
Father
was
himself
a
thirdborn
son,
and
younger
children
crave
the
approval
of
their
elders.
Frey
sensed
that
weakness
in
him,
and
Father
agreed
for
no
better
reason
than
to
please
him.
My
betrothal
was
announced
at
a
feast
with
half
the
west
in
attendance.
Ellyn
Tarbeck
laughed
and
the
Red
Lion
went
angry
from
the
hall.
The
rest
sat
on
their
tongues.
Only
Tywin
dared
speak
against
the
match.
A
boy
of
ten.
Father
turned
as
white
as
mare’s
milk,
and
Walder
Frey
was
quivering.”
She
smiled.
“How
could
I
not
love
him,
after
that?
That
is
not
to
say
that
I
approved
of
all
he
did,
or
much
enjoyed
the
company
of
the
man
that
he
became...
but
every
little
girl
needs
a
big
brother
to
protect
her.
Tywin
was
big
even
when
he
was
little.”
She
gave
a
sigh.
“Who
will
protect
us
now?”

Jaime
kissed
her
cheek.
“He
left
a
son.”

“Aye,
he
did.
That
is
what
I
fear
the
most,
in
truth.”

That
was
a
queer
remark.
“Why
should
you
fear?”

“Jaime,”
she
said,
tugging
on
his
ear,
“sweetling,
I
have
known
you
since
you
were
a
babe
at
Joanna’s
breast.
You
smile
like
Gerion
and
fight
like
Tyg,
and
there’s
some
of
Kevan
in
you,
else
you
would
not
wear
that
cloak...
but
Tyrion
is
Tywin’s
son,
not
you.
I
said
so
once
to
your
father’s
face,
and
he
would
not
speak
to
me
for
half
a
year.
Men
are
such
thundering
great
fools.
Even
the
sort
who
come
along
once
in
a
thousand
years.”





CAT
OF
THE
CANALS

She
woke
before
the
sun
came
up,
in
the
little
room
beneath
the
eaves
that
she
shared
with
Brusco’s
daughters.

Cat
was
always
the
first
to
awaken.
It
was
warm
and
snug
under
the
blankets
with
Talea
and
Brea.
She
could
hear
the
soft
sounds
of
their
breath.
When
she
stirred,
sitting
up
and
fumbling
for
her
slippers,
Brea
muttered
a
sleepy
complaint
and
rolled
over.
The
chill
off
the
grey
stone
walls
gave
Cat
gooseprickles.
She
dressed
quickly
in
the
darkness.
As
she
was
slipping
her
tunic
over
her
head,
Talea
opened
her
eyes
and
called
out,
“Cat,
be
a
sweet
and
bring
my
clothes
for
me.”
She
was
a
gawky
girl,
all
skin
and
bones
and
elbows,
always
complaining
she
was
cold.

Cat
fetched
her
clothes
for
her,
and
Talea
squirmed
into
them
underneath
the
blankets.
Together
they
pulled
her
big
sister
from
the
bed,
as
Brea
muttered
sleepy
threats.

By
the
time
the
three
of
them
climbed
down
the
ladder
from
the
room
beneath
the
eaves,
Brusco
and
his
sons
were
out
in
the
boat
on
the
little
canal
behind
the
house.
Brusco
barked
at
the
girls
to
hurry,
as
he
did
every
morning.
His
sons
helped
Talea
and
Brea
onto
the
boat.
It
was
Cat’s
task
to
untie
them
from
the
piling,
toss
the
rope
to
Brea,
and
shove
the
boat
away
from
the
dock
with
a
booted
foot.
Brusco’s
sons
leaned
into
their
poles.
Cat
ran
and
leapt
across
the
widening
gap
between
dock
and
deck.

After
that,
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
and
yawn
for
a
long
while
as
Brusco
and
his
sons
pushed
them
through
the
predawn
gloom,
wending
down
a
confusion
of
small
canals.
The
day
looked
to
be
a
rare
one,
crisp
and
clear
and
bright.
Braavos
only
had
three
kinds
of
weather;
fog
was
bad,
rain
was
worse,
and
freezing
rain
was
worst.
But
every
so
often
would
come
a
morning
when
the
dawn
broke
pink
and
blue
and
the
air
was
sharp
and
salty.
Those
were
the
days
that
Cat
loved
best.

When
they
reached
the
broad
straight
waterway
that
was
the
Long
Canal,
they
turned
south
for
the
fishmarket.
Cat
sat
with
her
legs
crossed,
fighting
a
yawn
and
trying
to
recall
the
details
of
her
dream.
I
dreamed
I
was
a
wolf
again.
She
could
remember
the
smells
best
of
all:
trees
and
earth,
her
pack
brothers,
the
scents
of
horse
and
deer
and
man,
each
different
from
the
others,
and
the
sharp
acrid
tang
of
fear,
always
the
same.
Some
nights
the
wolf
dreams
were
so
vivid
that
she
could
hear
her
brothers
howling
even
as
she
woke,
and
once
Brea
had
claimed
that
she
was
growling
in
her
sleep
as
she
thrashed
beneath
the
covers.
She
thought
that
was
some
stupid
lie
till
Talea
said
it
too.

I
should
not
be
dreaming
wolf
dreams,
the
girl
told
herself.
I
am
a
cat
now,
not
a
wolf.
I
am
Cat
of
the
Canals.
The
wolf
dreams
belonged
to
Arya
of
House
Stark.
Try
as
she
might,
though,
she
could
not
rid
herself
of
Arya.
It
made
no
difference
whether
she
slept
beneath
the
temple
or
in
the
little
room
beneath
the
eaves
with
Brusco’s
daughters,
the
wolf
dreams
still
haunted
her
by
night...
and
sometimes
other
dreams
as
well.

The
wolf
dreams
were
the
good
ones.
In
the
wolf
dreams
she
was
swift
and
strong,
running
down
her
prey
with
her
pack
at
her
heels.
It
was
the
other
dream
she
hated,
the
one
where
she
had
two
feet
instead
of
four.
In
that
one
she
was
always
looking
for
her
mother,
stumbling
through
a
wasted
land
of
mud
and
blood
and
fire.
It
was
always
raining
in
that
dream,
and
she
could
hear
her
mother
screaming,
but
a
monster
with
a
dog’s
head
would
not
let
her
go
save
her.
In
that
dream
she
was
always
weeping,
like
a
frightened
little
girl.
Cats
never
weep,
she
told
herself,
no
more
than
wolves
do.
It’s
just
a
stupid
dream.

The
Long
Canal
took
Brusco’s
boat
beneath
the
green
copper
domes
of
the
Palace
of
Truth
and
the
tall
square
towers
of
the
Prestayns
and
Antaryons
before
passing
under
the
immense
grey
arches
of
the
sweetwater
river
to
the
district
known
as
Silty
Town,
where
the
buildings
were
smaller
and
less
grand.
Later
in
the
day
the
canal
would
be
choked
with
serpent
boats
and
barges,
but
in
the
predawn
darkness
they
had
the
waterway
almost
to
themselves.
Brusco
liked
to
reach
the
fishmarket
just
as
the
Titan
roared
to
herald
the
coming
of
the
sun.
The
sound
would
boom
across
the
lagoon,
faint
with
distance
but
still
loud
enough
to
wake
the
sleeping
city.

By
the
time
Brusco
and
his
sons
tied
up
by
the
fishmarket,
it
was
swarming
with
herring
sellers
and
cod
wives,
oystermen,
clam
diggers,
stewards,
cooks,
smallwives,
and
sailors
off
the
galleys,
all
haggling
loudly
with
one
another
as
they
inspected
the
morning
catch.
Brusco
would
walk
from
boat
to
boat,
having
a
look
at
all
the
shellfish,
and
from
time
to
time
tapping
a
cask
or
crate
with
his
cane.
“This
one,”
he
would
say.
“Yes.”
Tap
tap.
“This
one.”
Tap
tap.
“No,
not
that.
Here.”
Tap.
He
was
not
much
one
for
talking.
Talea
said
her
father
was
as
grudging
with
his
words
as
with
his
coins.
Oysters,
clams,
crabs,
mussels,
cockles,
sometimes
prawns...
Brusco
bought
it
all,
depending
on
what
looked
best
each
day.
It
was
for
them
to
carry
the
crates
and
casks
that
he
tapped
back
to
the
boat.
Brusco
had
a
bad
back,
and
could
not
lift
anything
heavier
than
a
tankard
of
brown
ale.

Cat
always
stank
of
brine
and
fish
by
the
time
they
pushed
off
for
home
again.
She
had
grown
so
used
to
it
that
she
hardly
even
smelled
it
anymore.
She
did
not
mind
the
work.
When
her
muscles
ached
from
lifting,
or
her
back
got
sore
from
the
weight
of
a
cask,
she
told
herself
that
she
was
getting
stronger.

Once
all
the
casks
were
loaded,
Brusco
shoved
them
off
again,
and
his
sons
poled
them
back
up
the
Long
Canal.
Brea
and
Talea
sat
at
the
front
of
the
boat
whispering
to
one
another.
Cat
knew
that
they
were
talking
about
Brea’s
boy,
the
one
she
climbed
up
on
the
roof
to
meet,
after
her
father
was
asleep.

“Learn
three
new
things
before
you
come
back
to
us,”
the
kindly
man
had
commanded
Cat,
when
he
sent
her
forth
into
the
city.
She
always
did.
Sometimes
it
was
no
more
than
three
new
words
of
the
Braavosi
tongue.
Sometimes
she
brought
back
sailor’s
tales,
of
strange
and
wondrous
happenings
from
the
wide
wet
world
beyond
the
isles
of
Braavos,
wars
and
rains
of
toads
and
dragons
hatching.
Sometimes
she
learned
three
new
japes
or
three
new
riddles,
or
tricks
of
this
trade
or
the
other.
And
every
so
often,
she
would
learn
some
secret.

Braavos
was
a
city
made
for
secrets,
a
city
of
fogs
and
masks
and
whispers.
Its
very
existence
had
been
a
secret
for
a
century,
the
girl
had
learned;
its
location
had
been
hidden
thrice
that
long.
“The
Nine
Free
Cities
are
the
daughters
of
Valyria
that
was,”
the
kindly
man
taught
her,
“but
Braavos
is
the
bastard
child
who
ran
away
from
home.
We
are
a
mongrel
folk,
the
sons
of
slaves
and
whores
and
thieves.
Our
forebears
came
from
half
a
hundred
lands
to
this
place
of
refuge,
to
escape
the
dragonlords
who
had
enslaved
them.
Half
a
hundred
gods
came
with
them,
but
there
is
one
god
all
of
them
shared
in
common.”

“Him
of
Many
Faces.”

“And
many
names,”
the
kindly
man
had
said.
“In
Qohor
he
is
the
Black
Goat,
in
Yi
Ti
the
Lion
of
Night,
in
Westeros
the
Stranger.
All
men
must
bow
to
him
in
the
end,
no
matter
if
they
worship
the
Seven
or
the
Lord
of
Light,
the
Moon
Mother
or
the
Drowned
God
or
the
Great
Shepherd.
All
mankind
belongs
to
him...
else
somewhere
in
the
world
would
be
a
folk
who
lived
forever.
Do
you
know
of
any
folk
who
live
forever?”

“No,”
she
would
answer.
“All
men
must
die.”

Cat
would
always
find
the
kindly
man
waiting
for
her
when
she
went
creeping
back
to
the
temple
on
the
knoll
on
the
night
the
moon
went
black.
“What
do
you
know
that
you
did
not
know
when
you
left
us?”
he
would
always
ask
her.

“I
know
what
Blind
Beqqo
puts
in
the
hot
sauce
he
uses
on
his
oysters,”
she
would
say.
“I
know
the
mummers
at
the
Blue
Lantern
are
going
to
do
The
Lord
of
the
Woeful
Countenance
and
the
mummers
at
the
Ship
mean
to
answer
with
Seven
Drunken
Oarsmen.
I
know
the
bookseller
Lotho
Lornel
sleeps
in
the
house
of
Tradesman-Captain
Moredo
Prestayn
whenever
the
honorable
tradesman-captain
is
away
on
a
voyage,
and
moves
out
whenever
the
Vixen
comes
home.”

“It
is
good
to
know
these
things.
And
who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

“You
lie.
You
are
Cat
of
the
canals,
I
know
you
well.
Go
and
sleep,
child.
On
the
morrow
you
must
serve.”

“All
men
must
serve.”
And
so
she
did,
three
days
of
every
thirty.
When
the
moon
was
black
she
was
no
one,
a
servant
of
the
Many-Faced
God
in
a
robe
of
black
and
white.
She
walked
beside
the
kindly
man
through
the
fragrant
darkness,
carrying
her
iron
lantern.
She
washed
the
dead,
went
through
their
clothes,
and
counted
out
their
coins.
Some
days
she
still
helped
Umma
cook,
chopping
big
white
mushrooms
and
boning
fish.
But
only
when
the
moon
was
black.
The
rest
of
the
time
she
was
an
orphan
girl
in
a
pair
of
battered
boots
too
big
for
her
feet
and
a
brown
cloak
with
a
ragged
hem,
crying
“Mussels
and
cockles
and
clams”
as
she
wheeled
her
barrow
through
the
Ragman’s
Harbor.

The
moon
would
be
black
tonight,
she
knew;
last
night
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
sliver.
“What
do
you
know
that
you
did
not
know
when
you
left
us?”
the
kindly
man
would
ask
as
soon
as
he
saw
her.
I
know
that
Brusco’s
daughter
Brea
meets
a
boy
on
the
roof
when
her
father
is
asleep,
she
thought.
Brea
lets
him
touch
her,
Talea
says,
even
though
he’s
just
a
roof
rat
and
all
the
roof
rats
are
supposed
to
be
thieves.
That
was
only
one
thing,
though.
Cat
would
need
two
more.
She
was
not
concerned.
There
were
always
new
things
to
learn,
down
by
the
ships.

When
they
returned
to
the
house
Cat
helped
Brusco’s
sons
unload
the
boat.
Brusco
and
his
daughters
divided
the
shellfish
amongst
three
barrows,
arranging
them
on
layered
beds
of
seaweed.
“Come
back
when
all
is
sold,”
Brusco
told
the
girls,
just
as
he
did
every
morning,
and
they
set
forth
to
cry
the
catch.
Brea
would
wheel
her
barrow
to
the
Purple
Harbor,
to
sell
to
the
Braavosi
sailors
whose
ships
were
anchored
there.
Talea
would
try
the
alleys
round
the
Moon
Pool,
or
sell
amongst
the
temples
on
the
Isle
of
the
Gods.
Cat
headed
for
the
Ragman’s
Harbor,
as
she
did
nine
days
of
every
ten.

Only
Braavosi
were
permitted
use
of
the
Purple
Harbor,
from
the
Drowned
Town
and
the
Sealord’s
Palace;
ships
from
her
sister
cities
and
the
rest
of
the
wide
world
had
to
use
the
Ragman’s
Harbor,
a
poorer,
rougher,
dirtier
port
than
the
Purple.
It
was
noisier
as
well,
as
sailors
and
traders
from
half
a
hundred
lands
crowded
its
wharves
and
alleys,
mingling
with
those
who
served
and
preyed
on
them.
Cat
liked
it
best
of
any
place
in
Braavos.
She
liked
the
noise
and
the
strange
smells,
and
seeing
what
ships
had
come
in
on
the
evening
tide
and
what
ships
had
departed.
She
liked
the
sailors
too;
the
boisterous
Tyroshi
with
their
booming
voices
and
dyed
whiskers;
the
fair-haired
Lyseni,
always
trying
to
niggle
down
her
prices;
the
squat,
hairy
sailors
from
the
Port
of
Ibben,
growling
curses
in
low,
raspy
voices.
Her
favorites
were
the
Summer
Islanders,
with
their
skins
as
smooth
and
dark
as
teak.
They
wore
feathered
cloaks
of
red
and
green
and
yellow,
and
the
tall
masts
and
white
sails
of
their
swan
ships
were
magnificent.

And
sometimes
there
were
Westerosi
too,
oarsmen
and
sailors
off
carracks
out
of
Oldtown,
trading
galleys
out
of
Duskendale,
King’s
Landing,
and
Gulltown,
big-bellied
wine
cogs
from
the
Arbor.
Cat
knew
the
Braavosi
words
for
mussels
and
cockles
and
clams,
but
along
the
Ragman’s
Harbor
she
cried
her
wares
in
the
trade
tongue,
the
language
of
the
wharves
and
docks
and
sailor’s
taverns,
a
coarse
jumble
of
words
and
phrases
from
a
dozen
languages,
accompanied
by
hand
signs
and
gestures,
most
of
them
insulting.
Those
were
the
ones
that
Cat
liked
best.
Any
man
who
bothered
her
was
apt
to
see
the
fig,
or
hear
himself
described
as
an
ass’s
pizzle
or
a
camel’s
cunt.
“Maybe
I
never
saw
a
camel,”
she
would
tell
them,
“but
I
know
a
camel’s
cunt
when
I
smell
one.”

Once
in
a
great
while
that
would
make
somebody
angry,
but
when
it
did
she
had
her
finger
knife.
She
kept
it
very
sharp,
and
knew
how
to
use
it
too.
Red
Roggo
showed
her
one
afternoon
at
the
Happy
Port,
while
he
was
waiting
for
Lanna
to
come
free.
He
taught
her
how
to
hide
it
up
her
sleeve
and
slip
it
out
when
she
had
need
of
it,
and
how
to
slice
a
purse
so
smooth
and
quick
the
coins
would
all
be
spent
before
their
owner
ever
missed
them.
That
was
good
to
know,
even
the
kindly
man
agreed;
especially
at
night,
when
the
bravos
and
roof
rats
were
abroad.

Cat
had
made
friends
along
the
wharves;
porters
and
mummers,
ropemakers
and
sailmenders,
taverners,
brewers
and
bakers
and
beggars
and
whores.
They
bought
clams
and
cockles
from
her,
told
her
true
tales
of
Braavos
and
lies
about
their
lives,
and
laughed
at
the
way
she
talked
when
she
tried
to
speak
Braavosi.
She
never
let
that
trouble
her.
Instead,
she
showed
them
all
the
fig,
and
told
them
they
were
camel
cunts,
which
made
them
roar
with
laughter.
Gyloro
Dothare
taught
her
filthy
songs,
and
his
brother
Gyleno
told
her
the
best
places
to
catch
eels.
The
mummers
off
the
Ship
showed
her
how
a
hero
stands,
and
taught
her
speeches
from
The
Song
of
the
Rhoyne,
The
Conqueror’s
Two
Wives,
and
The
Merchant’s
Lusty
Lady.
Quill,
the
sad-eyed
little
man
who
made
up
all
the
bawdy
farces
for
the
Ship,
offered
to
teach
her
how
a
woman
kisses,
but
Tagganaro
smacked
him
with
a
codfish
and
put
an
end
to
that.
Cossomo
the
Conjurer
instructed
her
in
sleight
of
hand.
He
could
swallow
mice
and
pull
them
from
her
ears.
“It’s
magic,”
he’d
say.
“It’s
not,”
Cat
said.
“The
mouse
was
up
your
sleeve
the
whole
time.
I
could
see
it
moving.”

“Oysters,
clams,
and
cockles”
were
Cat’s
magic
words,
and
like
all
good
magic
words
they
could
take
her
almost
anywhere.
She
had
boarded
ships
from
Lys
and
Oldtown
and
the
Port
of
Ibben
and
sold
her
oysters
right
on
deck.
Some
days
she
rolled
her
barrow
past
the
towers
of
the
mighty
to
offer
baked
clams
to
the
guardsmen
at
their
gates.
Once
she
cried
her
catch
on
the
steps
of
the
Palace
of
Truth,
and
when
another
peddler
tried
to
run
her
off
she
turned
his
cart
over
and
sent
his
oysters
skittering
across
the
cobbles.
Customs
officers
from
the
Chequy
Port
would
buy
from
her,
and
paddlers
from
the
Drowned
Town,
whose
sunken
domes
and
towers
poked
up
from
the
green
waters
of
the
lagoon.
One
time,
when
Brea
took
to
her
bed
with
her
moon
blood,
Cat
had
pushed
her
barrow
to
the
Purple
Harbor
to
sell
crabs
and
prawns
to
oarsmen
off
the
Sealord’s
pleasure
barge,
covered
stem
to
stern
with
laughing
faces.
Other
days
she
followed
the
sweetwater
river
to
the
Moon
Pool.
She
sold
to
swaggering
bravos
in
striped
satin,
and
to
keyholders
and
justiciars
in
drab
coats
of
brown
and
grey.
But
she
always
returned
to
the
Ragman’s
Harbor.

“Oysters,
clams,
and
cockles,”
the
girl
shouted
as
she
pushed
her
barrow
along
the
wharves.
“Mussels,
prawns,
and
cockles.”
A
dirty
orange
cat
came
padding
after
her,
drawn
by
the
sound
of
her
call.
Farther
on,
a
second
cat
appeared,
a
sad,
bedraggled
grey
thing
with
a
stub
tail.
Cats
liked
the
smell
of
Cat.
Some
days
she
would
have
a
dozen
trailing
after
her
before
the
sun
went
down.
From
time
to
time
the
girl
would
throw
an
oyster
at
them
and
watch
to
see
who
came
away
with
it.
The
biggest
toms
would
seldom
win,
she
noticed;
oft
as
not,
the
prize
went
to
some
smaller,
quicker
animal,
thin
and
mean
and
hungry.
Like
me,
she
told
herself.
Her
favorite
was
a
scrawny
old
tom
with
a
chewed
ear
who
reminded
her
of
a
cat
that
she’d
once
chased
all
around
the
Red
Keep.
No,
that
was
some
other
girl,
not
me.

Two
of
the
ships
that
had
been
here
yesterday
were
gone,
Cat
saw,
but
five
new
ones
had
docked;
a
small
carrack
called
the
Brazen
Monkey,
a
huge
Ibbenese
whaler
that
reeked
of
tar
and
blood
and
whale
oil,
two
battered
cogs
from
Pentos,
and
a
lean
green
galley
up
from
Old
Volantis.
Cat
stopped
at
the
foot
of
every
gangplank
to
cry
her
clams
and
oysters,
once
in
the
trade
talk
and
again
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros.
A
crewman
on
the
whaler
cursed
at
her
so
loudly
that
he
scared
away
her
cats
and
one
of
the
Pentoshi
oarsman
asked
how
much
she
wanted
for
the
clam
between
her
legs,
but
she
fared
better
at
the
other
ships.
A
mate
on
the
green
galley
wolfed
half
a
dozen
oysters
and
told
her
how
his
captain
had
been
killed
by
the
Lysene
pirates
who
had
tried
to
board
them
near
the
Stepstones.
“That
bastard
Saan
it
was,
with
Old
Mother’s
Son
and
his
big
Valyrian.
We
got
away,
but
just.”

The
little
Brazen
Monkey
proved
to
be
from
Gulltown,
with
a
Wes-terosi
crew
who
were
glad
to
talk
to
someone
in
the
Common
Tongue.
One
asked
how
a
girl
from
King’s
Landing
came
to
be
selling
mussels
on
the
docks
of
Braavos,
so
she
had
to
tell
her
tale.
“We’re
here
four
days,
and
four
long
nights,”
another
told
her.
“Where’s
a
man
to
go
to
find
a
bit
of
sport?”

“The
mummers
at
the
Ship
are
doing
Seven
Drunken
Oarsmen,”
Cat
told
them,
“and
there’s
eel
fights
in
the
Spotted
Cellar,
down
by
the
gates
of
Drowned
Town.
Or
if
you
want
you
can
go
by
the
Moon
Pool,
where
the
bravos
duel
at
night.”

“Aye,
that’s
good,”
another
sailor
said,
“but
what
Wat
was
really
wanting
was
a
woman.”

“The
best
whores
are
at
the
Happy
Port,
down
by
where
the
mummers’
Ship
is
moored.”
She
pointed.
Some
of
the
dockside
whores
were
vicious,
and
sailors
fresh
from
the
sea
never
knew
which
ones.
S’vrone
was
the
worst.
Everyone
said
she
had
robbed
and
killed
a
dozen
men,
rolling
the
bodies
into
the
canals
to
feed
the
eels.
The
Drunken
Daughter
could
be
sweet
when
sober,
but
not
with
wine
in
her.
And
Canker
Jeyne
was
really
a
man.
“Ask
for
Merry.
Meralyn
is
her
true
name,
but
everyone
calls
her
Merry,
and
she
is.”
Merry
bought
a
dozen
oysters
every
time
Cat
came
by
the
brothel
and
shared
them
with
her
girls.
She
had
a
good
heart,
everyone
agreed.
“That,
and
the
biggest
pair
of
teats
in
all
of
Braavos,”
Merry
herself
was
fond
of
boasting.

Her
girls
were
nice
as
well;
Blushing
Bethany
and
the
Sailor’s
Wife,
one-eyed
Yna
who
could
tell
your
fortune
from
a
drop
of
blood,
pretty
little
Lanna,
even
Assadora,
the
Ibbenese
woman
with
the
mustache.
They
might
not
be
beautiful,
but
they
were
kind
to
her.
“The
Happy
Port
is
where
all
the
porters
go,”
Cat
assured
the
men
of
the
Brazen
Monkey.
“‘The
boys
unload
the
ships,’
Merry
says,
‘and
my
girls
unload
the
lads
who
sail
them.’”

“What
about
them
fancy
whores
the
singers
sing
about?”
asked
the
youngest
monkey,
a
red-haired
boy
with
freckles
who
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
six-and-ten.
“Are
they
as
pretty
as
they
say?
Where
would
I
get
one
o’
them?”

His
shipmates
looked
at
him
and
laughed.
“Seven
hells,
boy,”
said
one
of
them.
“Might
be
the
captain
could
get
hisself
a
courty-san,
but
only
if
he
sold
the
bloody
ship.
That
sort
o’
cunt’s
for
lords
and
such,
not
for
the
likes
o’
us.”

The
courtesans
of
Braavos
were
famed
across
the
world.
Singers
sang
of
them,
goldsmiths
and
jewelers
showered
them
with
gifts,
craftsmen
begged
for
the
honor
of
their
custom,
merchant
princes
paid
royal
ransoms
to
have
them
on
their
arms
at
balls
and
feasts
and
mummer
shows,
and
bravos
slew
each
other
in
their
names.
As
she
pushed
her
barrow
along
the
canals,
Cat
would
sometimes
glimpse
one
of
them
floating
by,
on
her
way
to
an
evening
with
some
lover.
Every
courtesan
had
her
own
barge,
and
servants
to
pole
her
to
her
trysts.
The
Poetess
always
had
a
book
to
hand,
the
Moonshadow
wore
only
white
and
silver,
and
the
Merling
Queen
was
never
seen
without
her
Mermaids,
four
young
maidens
in
the
blush
of
their
first
flowering
who
held
her
train
and
did
her
hair.
Each
courtesan
was
more
beautiful
than
the
last.
Even
the
Veiled
Lady
was
beautiful,
though
only
those
she
took
as
lovers
ever
saw
her
face.

“I
sold
three
cockles
to
a
courtesan,”
Cat
told
the
sailors.
“She
called
to
me
as
she
was
stepping
off
her
barge.”
Brusco
had
made
it
plain
to
her
that
she
was
never
to
speak
to
a
courtesan
unless
she
was
spoken
to
first,
but
the
woman
had
smiled
at
her
and
paid
her
in
silver,
ten
times
what
the
cockles
had
been
worth.

“Which
one
was
this,
now?
The
Queen
o’
Cockles,
was
it?”

“The
Black
Pearl,”
she
told
them.
Merry
claimed
the
Black
Pearl
was
the
most
famous
courtesan
of
all.
“She’s
descended
from
the
dragons,
that
one,”
the
woman
had
told
Cat.
“The
first
Black
Pearl
was
a
pirate
queen.
A
Westerosi
prince
took
her
for
a
lover
and
got
a
daughter
on
her,
who
grew
up
to
be
a
courtesan.
Her
own
daughter
followed
her,
and
her
daughter
after
her,
until
you
get
to
this
one.
What
did
she
say
to
you,
Cat?”

“She
said
‘I’ll
take
three
cockles,’
and
‘Do
you
have
some
hot
sauce,
little
one?’”
the
girl
had
answered.

“And
what
did
you
say?”

“I
said,
‘No,
my
lady,’
and,
‘Don’t
call
me
little
one.
My
name
is
Cat.’
I
should
have
hot
sauce.
Beqqo
does,
and
he
sells
three
times
as
many
oysters
as
Brusco.”

Cat
told
the
kindly
man
about
the
Black
Pearl
too.
“Her
true
name
is
Bellegere
Otherys,”
she
informed
him.
It
was
one
of
the
three
things
that
she
had
learned.

“It
is,”
the
priest
said
softly.
“Her
mother
was
Bellonara,
but
the
first
Black
Pearl
was
a
Bellegere
as
well.”

Cat
knew
that
the
men
off
the
Brazen
Monkey
would
not
care
about
the
name
of
a
courtesan’s
mother,
though.
Instead,
she
asked
them
for
tidings
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
the
war.

“War?”
laughed
one
of
them.
“What
war?
There
is
no
war.”

“Not
in
Gulltown,”
said
another.
“Not
in
the
Vale.
The
little
lord’s
kept
us
out
of
it,
same
as
his
mother
did.”

Same
as
his
mother
did.
The
lady
of
the
Vale
was
her
own
mother’s
sister.
“Lady
Lysa,”
she
said,
“is
she...?”

“...dead?”
finished
the
freckled
boy
whose
head
was
full
of
courtesans.
“Aye.
Murdered
by
her
own
singer.”

“Oh.”
It’s
nought
to
me.
Cat
of
the
Canals
never
had
an
aunt.
She
never
did.
Cat
lifted
her
barrow
and
wheeled
away
from
the
Brazen
Monkey,
bumping
over
cobblestones.
“Oysters,
clams,
and
cockles,”
she
called.
“Oysters,
clams,
and
cockles.”
She
sold
most
of
her
clams
to
the
porters
off-loading
the
big
wine
cog
from
the
Arbor,
and
the
rest
to
the
men
repairing
a
Myrish
trading
galley
that
had
been
savaged
by
the
storms.

Farther
down
the
docks
she
came
on
Tagganaro
sitting
with
his
back
against
a
piling,
next
to
Casso,
King
of
Seals.
He
bought
some
mussels
from
her,
and
Casso
barked
and
let
her
shake
his
flipper.
“You
come
work
with
me,
Cat,”
urged
Tagganaro
as
he
was
sucking
mussels
from
their
shells.
He
had
been
looking
for
a
new
partner
ever
since
the
Drunken
Daughter
put
her
knife
through
Little
Narbo’s
hand.
“I
give
you
more
than
Brusco,
and
you
would
not
smell
like
fish.”

“Casso
likes
the
way
I
smell,”
she
said.
The
King
of
Seals
barked,
as
if
to
agree.
“Is
Narbo’s
hand
no
better?”

“Three
fingers
do
not
bend,”
complained
Tagganaro,
between
mussels.
“What
good
is
a
cutpurse
who
cannot
use
his
fingers?
Narbo
was
good
at
picking
pockets,
not
so
good
at
picking
whores.”

“Merry
says
the
same.”
Cat
was
sad.
She
liked
Little
Narbo,
even
if
he
was
a
thief.
“What
will
he
do?”

“Pull
an
oar,
he
says.
Two
fingers
are
enough
for
that,
he
thinks,
and
the
Sealord’s
always
looking
for
more
oarsmen.
I
tell
him,
‘Narbo,
no.
That
sea
is
colder
than
a
maiden
and
crueler
than
a
whore.
Better
you
should
cut
off
the
hand,
and
beg.’
Casso
knows
I
am
right.
Don’t
you,
Casso?”

The
seal
barked,
and
Cat
had
to
smile.
She
tossed
another
cockle
his
way
before
she
went
off
on
her
own.

The
day
was
nearly
done
by
the
time
Cat
reached
the
Happy
Port,
across
the
alley
from
where
the
Ship
was
anchored.
Some
of
the
mummers
sat
up
atop
the
listing
hulk,
passing
a
skin
of
wine
from
hand
to
hand,
but
when
they
saw
Cat’s
barrow
they
came
down
for
some
oysters.
She
asked
them
how
it
went
with
Seven
Drunken
Oarsmen.
Joss
the
Gloom
shook
his
head.
“Quence
finally
came
on
Allaquo
abed
with
Sloey.
They
went
at
one
another
with
mummer
swords,
and
both
of
them
have
left
us.
We’ll
only
be
five
drunken
oarsmen
tonight,
it
would
seem.”

“We
shall
strive
to
make
up
in
drunkenness
what
we
lack
in
oarsmen,”
declared
Myrmello.
“I
for
one
am
equal
to
the
task.”

“Little
Narbo
wants
to
be
an
oarsman,”
Cat
told
them.
“If
you
got
him,
you’d
have
six.”

“You
had
best
go
see
Merry,”
Joss
told
her.
“You
know
how
sour
she
gets
without
her
oysters.”

When
Cat
slipped
inside
the
brothel,
though,
she
found
Merry
sitting
in
the
common
room
with
her
eyes
shut,
listening
to
Dareon
play
his
woodharp.
Yna
was
there
too,
braiding
Lanna’s
fine
long
golden
hair.
Another
stupid
love
song.
Lanna
was
always
begging
the
singer
to
play
her
stupid
love
songs.
She
was
the
youngest
of
the
whores,
only
ten-and-four.
Merry
asked
three
times
as
much
for
her
as
for
any
of
the
other
girls,
Cat
knew.

It
made
her
angry
to
see
Dareon
sitting
there
so
brazen,
making
eyes
at
Lanna
as
his
fingers
danced
across
the
harp
strings.
The
whores
called
him
the
black
singer,
but
there
was
hardly
any
black
about
him
now.
With
the
coin
his
singing
brought
him,
the
crow
had
transformed
himself
into
a
peacock.
Today
he
wore
a
plush
purple
cloak
lined
with
vair,
a
striped
white-and-lilac
tunic,
and
the
parti-colored
breeches
of
a
bravo,
but
he
owned
a
silken
cloak
as
well,
and
one
made
of
burgundy
velvet
that
was
lined
with
cloth-of-gold.
The
only
black
about
him
was
his
boots.
Cat
had
heard
him
tell
Lanna
that
he’d
thrown
all
the
rest
in
a
canal.
“I
am
done
with
darkness,”
he
had
announced.

He
is
a
man
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
she
thought,
as
he
sang
about
some
stupid
lady
throwing
herself
off
some
stupid
tower
because
her
stupid
prince
was
dead.
The
lady
should
go
kill
the
ones
who
killed
her
prince.
And
the
singer
should
be
on
the
Wall.
When
Dareon
had
first
appeared
at
the
Happy
Port,
Arya
had
almost
asked
if
he
would
take
her
with
him
back
to
Eastwatch,
until
she
heard
him
telling
Bethany
that
he
was
never
going
back.
“Hard
beds,
salt
cod,
and
endless
watches,
that’s
the
Wall,”
he’d
said.
“Besides,
there’s
no
one
half
as
pretty
as
you
at
Eastwatch.
How
could
I
ever
leave
you?”
He
had
said
the
same
thing
to
Lanna,
Cat
had
heard,
and
to
one
of
the
whores
at
the
Cattery,
and
even
to
the
Nightingale
the
night
he
played
at
the
House
of
Seven
Lamps.

I
wish
I
had
been
here
the
night
the
fat
one
hit
him.
Merry’s
whores
still
laughed
about
that.
Yna
said
the
fat
boy
had
gone
red
as
a
beet
every
time
she
touched
him,
but
when
he
started
trouble
Merry
had
him
dragged
outside
and
thrown
in
the
canal.

Cat
was
thinking
about
the
fat
boy,
remembering
how
she
had
saved
him
from
Terro
and
Orbelo,
when
the
Sailor’s
Wife
appeared
beside
her.
“He
sings
a
pretty
song,”
she
murmured
softly,
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros.
“The
gods
must
have
loved
him
to
give
him
such
a
voice,
and
that
fair
face
as
well.”

He
is
fair
of
face
and
foul
of
heart,
thought
Arya,
but
she
did
not
say
it.
Dareon
had
once
wed
the
Sailor’s
Wife,
who
would
only
bed
with
men
who
married
her.
The
Happy
Port
sometimes
had
three
or
four
weddings
a
night.
Often
the
cheerful
wine-soaked
red
priest
Ezzelyno
performed
the
rites.
Elsewise
it
was
Eustace,
who
had
once
been
a
septon
at
the
Sept-Beyond-the-Sea.
If
neither
priest
nor
septon
was
on
hand,
one
of
the
whores
would
run
to
the
Ship
and
fetch
back
a
mummer.
Merry
always
claimed
the
mummers
made
much
better
priests
than
priests,
especially
Myrmello.

The
weddings
were
loud
and
jolly,
with
a
lot
of
drinking.
Whenever
Cat
happened
by
with
her
barrow,
the
Sailor’s
Wife
would
insist
that
her
new
husband
buy
some
oysters,
to
stiffen
him
for
the
consummation.
She
was
good
that
way,
and
quick
to
laugh
as
well,
but
Cat
thought
there
was
something
sad
about
her
too.

The
other
whores
said
that
the
Sailor’s
Wife
visited
the
Isle
of
the
Gods
on
the
days
when
her
flower
was
in
bloom,
and
knew
all
the
gods
who
lived
there,
even
the
ones
that
Braavos
had
forgotten.
They
said
she
went
to
pray
for
her
first
husband,
her
true
husband,
who
had
been
lost
at
sea
when
she
was
a
girl
no
older
than
Lanna.
“She
thinks
that
if
she
finds
the
right
god,
maybe
he
will
send
the
winds
and
blow
her
old
love
back
to
her,”
said
one-eyed
Yna,
who
had
known
her
longest,
“but
I
pray
it
never
happens.
Her
love
is
dead,
I
could
taste
that
in
her
blood.
If
he
ever
should
come
back
to
her,
it
will
be
a
corpse.”

Dareon’s
song
was
finally
ending.
As
the
last
notes
faded
in
the
air,
Lanna
gave
a
sigh
and
the
singer
put
his
harp
aside
and
pulled
her
up
into
his
lap.
He
had
just
started
to
tickle
her
when
Cat
said
loudly,
“There’s
oysters,
if
anyone
is
wanting
some,”
and
Merry’s
eyes
popped
open.
“Good,”
the
woman
said.
“Bring
them
in,
child.
Yna,
fetch
some
bread
and
vinegar.”

The
swollen
red
sun
hung
in
the
sky
behind
the
row
of
masts
when
Cat
took
her
leave
of
the
Happy
Port,
with
a
plump
purse
of
coins
and
a
barrow
empty
but
for
salt
and
seaweed.
Dareon
was
leaving
too.
He
had
promised
to
sing
at
the
Inn
of
the
Green
Eel
this
evening,
he
told
her
as
they
strolled
along
together.
“Every
time
I
play
the
Eel
I
come
away
with
silver,”
he
boasted,
“and
some
nights
there
are
captains
there,
and
owners.”
They
crossed
a
little
bridge,
and
made
their
way
down
a
crooked
back
street
as
the
shadows
of
the
day
grew
longer.
“Soon
I
will
be
playing
in
the
Purple,
and
after
that
the
Sealord’s
Palace,”
Dareon
went
on.
Cat’s
empty
barrow
clattered
over
the
cobblestones,
making
its
own
sort
of
rattling
music.
“Yesterday
I
ate
herring
with
the
whores,
but
within
the
year
I’ll
be
having
emperor
crab
with
courtesans.”

“What
happened
to
your
brother?”
Cat
asked.
“The
fat
one.
Did
he
ever
find
a
ship
to
Oldtown?
He
said
he
was
supposed
to
sail
on
the
Lady
Ushanora.”

“We
all
were.
Lord
Snow’s
command.
I
told
Sam,
leave
the
old
man,
but
the
fat
fool
would
not
listen.”
The
last
light
of
the
setting
sun
shone
in
his
hair.
“Well,
it’s
too
late
now.”

“Just
so,”
said
Cat
as
they
stepped
into
the
gloom
of
a
twisty
little
alley.

By
the
time
Cat
returned
to
Brusco’s
house,
an
evening
fog
was
gathering
above
the
small
canal.
She
put
away
her
barrow,
found
Brusco
in
his
counting
room,
and
thumped
her
purse
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
him.
She
thumped
the
boots
down
too.

Brusco
gave
the
purse
a
pat.
“Good.
But
what’s
this?”

“Boots.”

“Good
boots
are
hard
to
find,”
said
Brusco,
“but
these
are
too
small
for
my
feet.”
He
picked
one
up
to
squint
at
it.

“The
moon
will
be
black
tonight,”
she
reminded
him.

“Best
you
pray,
then.”
Brusco
shoved
the
boots
aside
and
poured
out
the
coins
to
count
them.
“Valar
dohaeris.”

Valar
morghulis,
she
thought.

Fog
rose
all
around
as
she
walked
through
the
streets
of
Braavos.
She
was
shivering
a
little
by
the
time
she
pushed
through
the
weirwood
door
into
the
House
of
Black
and
White.
Only
a
few
candles
burned
this
evening,
flickering
like
fallen
stars.
In
the
darkness
all
the
gods
were
strangers.

Down
in
the
vaults,
she
untied
Cat’s
threadbare
cloak,
pulled
Cat’s
fishy
brown
tunic
over
her
head,
kicked
off
Cat’s
salt-stained
boots,
climbed
out
of
Cat’s
smallclothes,
and
bathed
in
lemonwater
to
wash
away
the
very
smell
of
Cat
of
the
Canals.
When
she
emerged,
soaped
and
scrubbed
pink
with
her
brown
hair
plastered
to
her
cheeks,
Cat
was
gone.
She
donned
clean
robes
and
a
pair
of
soft
cloth
slippers,
and
padded
to
the
kitchens
to
beg
some
food
of
Umma.
The
priests
and
acolytes
had
already
eaten,
but
the
cook
had
saved
a
piece
of
nice
fried
cod
for
her,
and
some
mashed
yellow
turnips.
She
wolfed
it
down,
washed
the
dish,
then
went
to
help
the
waif
prepare
her
potions.

Her
part
was
mostly
fetching,
scrambling
up
ladders
to
find
the
herbs
and
leaves
the
waif
required.
“Sweetsleep
is
the
gentlest
of
poisons,”
the
waif
told
her,
as
she
was
grinding
some
with
a
mortar
and
pestle.
“A
few
grains
will
slow
a
pounding
heart
and
stop
a
hand
from
shaking,
and
make
a
man
feel
calm
and
strong.
A
pinch
will
grant
a
night
of
deep
and
dreamless
sleep.
Three
pinches
will
produce
that
sleep
that
does
not
end.
The
taste
is
very
sweet,
so
it
is
best
used
in
cakes
and
pies
and
honeyed
wines.
Here,
you
can
smell
the
sweetness.”
She
let
her
have
a
whiff,
then
sent
her
up
the
ladders
to
find
a
red
glass
bottle.
“This
is
a
crueler
poison,
but
tasteless
and
odorless,
hence
easier
to
hide.
The
tears
of
Lys,
men
call
it.
Dissolved
in
wine
or
water,
it
eats
at
a
man’s
bowels
and
belly,
and
kills
as
a
sickness
of
those
parts.
Smell.”
Arya
sniffed,
and
smelled
nothing.
The
waif
put
the
tears
to
one
side
and
opened
a
fat
stone
jar.
“This
paste
is
spiced
with
basilisk
blood.
It
will
give
cooked
flesh
a
savory
smell,
but
if
eaten
it
produces
violent
madness,
in
beasts
as
well
as
men.
A
mouse
will
attack
a
lion
after
a
taste
of
basilisk
blood.”

Arya
chewed
her
lip.
“Would
it
work
on
dogs?”

“On
any
animal
with
warm
blood.”
The
waif
slapped
her.

She
raised
her
hand
to
her
cheek,
more
surprised
than
hurt.
“Why
did
you
do
that?”

“It
is
Arya
of
House
Stark
who
chews
on
her
lip
whenever
she
is
thinking.
Are
you
Arya
of
House
Stark?”

“I
am
no
one.”
She
was
angry.
“Who
are
you?”

She
did
not
expect
the
waif
to
answer,
but
she
did.
“I
was
born
the
only
child
of
an
ancient
House,
my
noble
father’s
heir,”
the
waif
replied.
“My
mother
died
when
I
was
little,
I
have
no
memory
of
her.
When
I
was
six
my
father
wed
again.
His
new
wife
treated
me
kindly
until
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
of
her
own.
Then
it
was
her
wish
that
I
should
die,
so
her
own
blood
might
inherit
my
father’s
wealth.
She
should
have
sought
the
favor
of
the
Many-Faced
God,
but
she
could
not
bear
the
sacrifice
he
would
ask
of
her.
Instead,
she
thought
to
poison
me
herself.
It
left
me
as
you
see
me
now,
but
I
did
not
die.
When
the
healers
in
the
House
of
the
Red
Hands
told
my
father
what
she
had
done,
he
came
here
and
made
sacrifice,
offering
up
all
his
wealth
and
me.
Him
of
Many
Faces
heard
his
prayer.
I
was
brought
to
the
temple
to
serve,
and
my
father’s
wife
received
the
gift.”

Arya
considered
her
warily.
“Is
that
true?”

“There
is
truth
in
it.”

“And
lies
as
well?”

“There
is
an
untruth,
and
an
exaggeration.”

She
had
been
watching
the
waif’s
face
the
whole
time
she
told
her
story,
but
the
other
girl
had
shown
her
no
signs.
“The
Many-Faced
God
took
two-thirds
of
your
father’s
wealth,
not
all.”

“Just
so.
That
was
my
exaggeration.”

Arya
grinned,
realized
she
was
grinning,
and
gave
her
cheek
a
pinch.
Rule
your
face,
she
told
herself.
My
smile
is
my
servant,
he
should
come
at
my
command.
“What
part
was
the
lie?”

“No
part.
I
lied
about
the
lie.”

“Did
you?
Or
are
you
lying
now?”

But
before
the
waif
could
answer,
the
kindly
man
stepped
into
the
chamber,
smiling.
“You
have
returned
to
us.”

“The
moon
is
black.”

“It
is.
What
three
new
things
do
you
know,
that
you
did
not
know
when
last
you
left
us?”

I
know
thirty
new
things,
she
almost
said.
“Three
of
Little
Narbo’s
fingers
will
not
bend.
He
means
to
be
an
oarsman.”

“It
is
good
to
know
this.
And
what
else?”

She
thought
back
on
her
day.
“Quence
and
Alaquo
had
a
fight
and
left
the
Ship,
but
I
think
that
they’ll
come
back.”

“Do
you
only
think,
or
do
you
know?”

“I
only
think,”
she
had
to
confess,
even
though
she
was
certain
of
it.
Mummers
had
to
eat
the
same
as
other
men,
and
Quence
and
Alaquo
were
not
good
enough
for
the
Blue
Lantern.

“Just
so,”
said
the
kindly
man.
“And
the
third
thing?”

This
time
she
did
not
hesitate.
“Dareon
is
dead.
The
black
singer
who
was
sleeping
at
the
Happy
Port.
He
was
really
a
deserter
from
the
Night’s
Watch.
Someone
slit
his
throat
and
pushed
him
into
a
canal,
but
they
kept
his
boots.”

“Good
boots
are
hard
to
find.”

“Just
so.”
She
tried
to
keep
her
face
still.

“Who
could
have
done
this
thing,
I
wonder?”

“Arya
of
House
Stark.”
She
watched
his
eyes,
his
mouth,
the
muscles
of
his
jaw.

“That
girl?
I
thought
she
had
left
Braavos.
Who
are
you?”

“No
one.”

“You
lie.”
He
turned
to
the
waif.
“My
throat
is
dry.
Do
me
a
kindness
and
bring
a
cup
of
wine
for
me
and
warm
milk
for
our
friend
Arya,
who
has
returned
to
us
so
unexpectedly.”

On
her
way
across
the
city
Arya
had
wondered
what
the
kindly
man
would
say
when
she
told
him
about
Dareon.
Maybe
he
would
be
angry
with
her,
or
maybe
he
would
be
pleased
that
she
had
given
the
singer
the
gift
of
the
Many-Faced
God.
She
had
played
this
talk
out
in
her
head
half
a
hundred
times,
like
a
mummer
in
a
show.
But
she
had
never
thought
warm
milk.

When
the
milk
came,
Arya
drank
it
down.
It
smelled
a
little
burnt
and
had
a
bitter
aftertaste.
“Go
to
bed
now,
child,”
the
kindly
man
said.
“On
the
morrow
you
must
serve.”

That
night
she
dreamed
she
was
a
wolf
again,
but
it
was
different
from
the
other
dreams.
In
this
dream
she
had
no
pack.
She
prowled
alone,
bounding
over
rooftops
and
padding
silently
beside
the
banks
of
a
canal,
stalking
shadows
through
the
fog.

When
she
woke
the
next
morning,
she
was
blind.





SAMWELL

The
Cinnamon
Wind
was
a
swan
ship
out
of
Tall
Trees
Town
on
the
Summer
Isles,
where
men
were
black,
women
were
wanton,
and
even
the
gods
were
strange.
She
had
no
septon
aboard
her
to
lead
them
in
the
prayers
of
passing,
so
the
task
fell
to
Samwell
Tarly,
somewhere
off
the
sun-scorched
southern
coast
of
Dorne.

Sam
donned
his
blacks
to
say
the
words,
though
the
afternoon
was
warm
and
muggy,
with
nary
a
breath
of
wind.
“He
was
a
good
man,”
he
began...
but
as
soon
as
he
had
said
the
words
he
knew
that
they
were
wrong.
“No.
He
was
a
great
man.
A
maester
of
the
Citadel,
chained
and
sworn,
and
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
ever
faithful.
When
he
was
born
they
named
him
for
a
hero
who
had
died
too
young,
but
though
he
lived
a
long
long
time,
his
own
life
was
no
less
heroic.
No
man
was
wiser,
or
gentler,
or
kinder.
At
the
Wall,
a
dozen
lords
commander
came
and
went
during
his
years
of
service,
but
he
was
always
there
to
counsel
them.
He
counseled
kings
as
well.
He
could
have
been
a
king
himself,
but
when
they
offered
him
the
crown
he
told
them
they
should
give
it
to
his
younger
brother.
How
many
men
would
do
that?”
Sam
felt
the
tears
welling
in
his
eyes,
and
knew
he
could
not
go
on
much
longer.
“He
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
but
now
his
fire
has
gone
out.
He
was
Aemon
Targaryen.
And
now
his
watch
is
ended.”

“And
now
his
watch
is
ended,”
Gilly
murmured
after
him,
rocking
the
babe
in
her
arms.
Kojja
Mo
echoed
her
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
Westeros,
then
repeated
the
words
in
the
Summer
Tongue
for
Xhondo
and
her
father
and
the
rest
of
the
assembled
crew.
Sam
hung
his
head
and
began
to
weep,
his
sobs
so
loud
and
wrenching
that
they
made
his
whole
body
shake.
Gilly
came
and
stood
beside
him
and
let
him
cry
upon
her
shoulder.
There
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
well.

The
air
was
moist
and
warm
and
dead
calm,
and
the
Cinnamon
Wind
was
adrift
upon
a
deep
blue
sea
far
beyond
the
sight
of
land.
“Black
Sam
said
good
words,”
Xhondo
said.
“Now
we
drink
his
life.”
He
shouted
something
in
the
Summer
Tongue,
and
a
cask
of
spiced
rum
was
rolled
up
onto
the
afterdeck
and
breached,
so
those
on
watch
might
down
a
cup
in
the
memory
of
the
old
blind
dragon.
The
crew
had
known
him
only
a
short
while,
but
Summer
Islanders
revered
the
elderly
and
celebrated
their
dead.

Sam
had
never
drunk
rum
before.
The
liquor
was
strange
and
heady;
sweet
at
first,
but
with
a
fiery
aftertaste
that
burned
his
tongue.
He
was
tired,
so
tired.
Every
muscle
he
had
was
aching,
and
there
were
other
aches
in
places
where
Sam
hadn’t
known
he
had
muscles.
His
knees
were
stiff,
his
hands
covered
with
fresh
new
blisters
and
raw,
sticky
patches
of
skin
where
the
old
blisters
had
burst.
Yet
between
them,
rum
and
sadness
seemed
to
wash
his
hurts
away.
“If
only
we
could
have
gotten
him
to
Oldtown,
the
archmaesters
might
have
saved
him,”
he
told
Gilly,
as
they
sipped
their
rum
on
the
Cinnamon
Wind’s
high
forecastle.
“The
healers
of
the
Citadel
are
the
best
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
For
a
while
I
thought...
I
hoped...”

On
Braavos,
it
had
seemed
possible
that
Aemon
might
recover.
Xhondo’s
talk
of
dragons
had
almost
seemed
to
restore
the
old
man
to
himself.
That
night
he
ate
every
bite
Sam
put
before
him.
“No
one
ever
looked
for
a
girl,”
he
said.
“It
was
a
prince
that
was
promised,
not
a
princess.
Rhaegar,
I
thought...
the
smoke
was
from
the
fire
that
devoured
Summerhall
on
the
day
of
his
birth,
the
salt
from
the
tears
shed
for
those
who
died.
He
shared
my
belief
when
he
was
young,
but
later
he
became
persuaded
that
it
was
his
own
son
who
fulfilled
the
prophecy,
for
a
comet
had
been
seen
above
King’s
Landing
on
the
night
Aegon
was
conceived,
and
Rhaegar
was
certain
the
bleeding
star
had
to
be
a
comet.
What
fools
we
were,
who
thought
ourselves
so
wise!
The
error
crept
in
from
the
translation.
Dragons
are
neither
male
nor
female,
Barth
saw
the
truth
of
that,
but
now
one
and
now
the
other,
as
changeable
as
flame.
The
language
misled
us
all
for
a
thousand
years.
Daenerys
is
the
one,
born
amidst
salt
and
smoke.
The
dragons
prove
it.”
Just
talking
of
her
seemed
to
make
him
stronger.
“I
must
go
to
her.
I
must.
Would
that
I
was
even
ten
years
younger.”

The
old
man
had
been
so
determined
that
he
had
even
walked
up
the
plank
onto
the
Cinnamon
Wind
on
his
own
two
legs,
after
Sam
made
arrangements
for
their
passage.
He
had
already
given
his
sword
and
scabbard
to
Xhondo,
to
repay
the
big
mate
for
the
feathered
cloak
he’d
ruined
saving
Sam
from
drowning.
The
only
things
of
value
that
still
remained
to
them
were
the
books
they
had
brought
from
the
vaults
of
Castle
Black.
Sam
parted
with
them
glumly.
“They
were
meant
for
the
Citadel,”
he
said,
when
Xhondo
asked
him
what
was
wrong.
When
the
mate
translated
those
words,
the
captain
laughed.
“Quhuru
Mo
says
the
grey
men
will
be
having
these
books
still,”
Xhondo
told
him,
“only
they
will
be
buying
them
from
Quhuru
Mo.
The
maesters
give
good
silver
for
books
they
are
not
having,
and
sometimes
red
and
yellow
gold.”

The
captain
wanted
Aemon’s
chain
as
well,
but
there
Sam
had
refused.
It
was
a
great
shame
for
any
maester
to
surrender
his
chain,
he
had
explained.
Xhondo
had
to
go
over
that
part
three
times
before
Quhuru
Mo
accepted
it.
By
the
time
the
dealing
was
done,
Sam
was
down
to
his
boots
and
blacks
and
smallclothes,
and
the
broken
horn
Jon
Snow
had
found
on
the
Fist
of
First
Men.
I
had
no
choice,
he
told
himself.
We
could
not
stay
on
Braavos,
and
short
of
theft
or
beggary,
there
was
no
other
way
to
pay
for
passage.
He
would
have
counted
it
cheap
at
thrice
the
price
if
only
they
had
gotten
Maester
Aemon
safe
to
Oldtown.

Their
passage
south
had
been
a
stormy
one,
however,
and
every
gale
took
its
toll
on
the
old
man’s
strength
and
spirits.
At
Pentos
he
asked
to
be
brought
up
onto
deck
so
Sam
might
paint
a
picture
of
the
city
for
him
with
words,
but
that
was
the
last
time
he
left
the
captain’s
bed.
Soon
after
that,
his
wits
began
to
wander
once
again.
By
the
time
the
Cinnamon
Wind
swept
past
the
Bleeding
Tower
into
Tyrosh
harbor,
Aemon
no
longer
spoke
of
trying
to
find
a
ship
to
take
him
east.
Instead
his
talk
turned
back
to
Oldtown,
and
the
archmaesters
of
the
Citadel.

“You
must
tell
them,
Sam,”
he
said.
“The
archmaesters.
You
must
make
them
understand.
The
men
who
were
at
the
Citadel
when
I
was
have
been
dead
for
fifty
years.
These
others
never
knew
me.
My
letters...
in
Oldtown,
they
must
have
read
like
the
ravings
of
an
old
man
whose
wits
had
fled.
You
must
convince
them,
where
I
could
not.
Tell
them,
Sam...
tell
them
how
it
is
upon
the
Wall...
the
wights
and
the
white
walkers,
the
creeping
cold...”

“I
will,”
Sam
promised.
“I
will
add
my
voice
to
yours,
maester.
We
will
both
tell
them,
the
two
of
us
together.”

“No,”
the
old
man
said.
“It
must
be
you.
Tell
them.
The
prophecy...
my
brother’s
dream...
Lady
Melisandre
has
misread
the
signs.
Stannis...
Stannis
has
some
of
the
dragon
blood
in
him,
yes.
His
brothers
did
as
well.
Rhaelle,
Egg’s
little
girl,
she
was
how
they
came
by
it...
their
father’s
mother...
she
used
to
call
me
Uncle
Maester
when
she
was
a
little
girl.
I
remembered
that,
so
I
allowed
myself
to
hope...
perhaps
I
wanted
to...
we
all
deceive
ourselves,
when
we
want
to
believe.
Melisandre
most
of
all,
I
think.
The
sword
is
wrong,
she
has
to
know
that...
light
without
heat...
an
empty
glamor...
the
sword
is
wrong,
and
the
false
light
can
only
lead
us
deeper
into
darkness,
Sam.
Daenerys
is
our
hope.
Tell
them
that,
at
the
Citadel.
Make
them
listen.
They
must
send
her
a
maester.
Daenerys
must
be
counseled,
taught,
protected.
For
all
these
years
I’ve
lingered,
waiting,
watching,
and
now
that
the
day
has
dawned
I
am
too
old.
I
am
dying,
Sam.”
Tears
ran
from
his
blind
white
eyes
at
that
admission.
“Death
should
hold
no
fear
for
a
man
as
old
as
me,
but
it
does.
Isn’t
that
silly?
It
is
always
dark
where
I
am,
so
why
should
I
fear
the
darkness?
Yet
I
cannot
help
but
wonder
what
will
follow,
when
the
last
warmth
leaves
my
body.
Will
I
feast
forever
in
the
Father’s
golden
hall
as
the
septons
say?
Will
I
talk
with
Egg
again,
find
Dareon
whole
and
happy,
hear
my
sisters
singing
to
their
children?
What
if
the
horselords
have
the
truth
of
it?
Will
I
ride
through
the
night
sky
forever
on
a
stallion
made
of
flame?
Or
must
I
return
again
to
this
vale
of
sorrow?
Who
can
say,
truly?
Who
has
been
beyond
the
wall
of
death
to
see?
Only
the
wights,
and
we
know
what
they
are
like.
We
know.”

There
was
little
and
less
that
Sam
could
say
to
that,
but
he
had
given
the
old
man
what
little
comfort
he
could.
And
Gilly
came
in
afterward
and
sang
a
song
for
him,
a
nonsense
song
thing
that
she
learned
from
some
of
Craster’s
other
wives.
It
made
the
old
man
smile
and
helped
him
go
to
sleep.

That
had
been
one
of
his
last
good
days.
After
that
the
old
man
spent
more
time
sleeping
than
awake,
curled
up
beneath
a
pile
of
furs
in
the
captain’s
cabin.
Sometimes
he
would
mutter
in
his
sleep.
When
he
woke
he’d
call
for
Sam,
insisting
that
he
had
to
tell
him
something,
but
oft
as
not
he
would
have
forgotten
what
he
meant
to
say
by
the
time
that
Sam
arrived.
Even
when
he
did
recall,
his
talk
was
all
a
jumble.
He
spoke
of
dreams
and
never
named
the
dreamer,
of
a
glass
candle
that
could
not
be
lit
and
eggs
that
would
not
hatch.
He
said
the
sphinx
was
the
riddle,
not
the
riddler,
whatever
that
meant.
He
asked
Sam
to
read
for
him
from
a
book
by
Septon
Barth,
whose
writings
had
been
burned
during
the
reign
of
Baelor
the
Blessed.
Once
he
woke
up
weeping.
“The
dragon
must
have
three
heads,”
he
wailed,
“but
I
am
too
old
and
frail
to
be
one
of
them.
I
should
be
with
her,
showing
her
the
way,
but
my
body
has
betrayed
me.”

As
the
Cinnamon
Wind
made
her
way
through
the
Stepstones,
Maester
Aemon
forgot
Sam’s
name
oft
as
not.
Some
days
he
took
him
for
one
of
his
dead
brothers.
“He
was
too
frail
for
such
a
long
voyage,”
Sam
told
Gilly
on
the
forecastle,
after
another
sip
of
the
rum.
“Jon
should
have
seen
that.
Aemon
was
a
hundred
and
two
years
old,
he
should
never
have
been
sent
to
sea.
If
he
had
stayed
at
Castle
Black,
he
might
have
lived
another
ten
years.”

“Or
else
she
might
have
burned
him.
The
red
woman.”
Even
here,
a
thousand
leagues
from
the
Wall,
Gilly
was
reluctant
to
say
Lady
Melisandre’s
name
aloud.
“She
wanted
king’s
blood
for
her
fires.
Val
knew
she
did.
Lord
Snow
too.
That
was
why
they
made
me
take
Dalla’s
babe
away
and
leave
my
own
behind
in
his
place.
Maester
Aemon
went
to
sleep
and
didn’t
wake
up,
but
if
he
had
stayed,
she
would
have
burned
him.”

He
will
still
burn,
Sam
thought
miserably,
only
now
I
have
to
do
it.
The
Targaryens
always
gave
their
fallen
to
the
flames.
Quhuru
Mo
would
not
allow
a
funeral
pyre
aboard
the
Cinnamon
Wind,
so
Aemon’s
corpse
had
been
stuffed
inside
a
cask
of
blackbelly
rum
to
preserve
it
until
the
ship
reached
Oldtown.

“The
night
before
he
died,
he
asked
if
he
might
hold
the
babe,”
Gilly
went
on.
“I
was
afraid
he
might
drop
him,
but
he
never
did.
He
rocked
him
and
hummed
a
song
for
him,
and
Dalla’s
boy
reached
up
and
touched
his
face.
The
way
he
pulled
his
lip
I
thought
he
might
be
hurting
him,
but
it
only
made
the
old
man
laugh.”
She
stroked
Sam’s
hand.
“We
could
name
the
little
one
Maester,
if
you
like.
When
he’s
old
enough,
not
now.
We
could.”

“Maester
is
not
a
name.
You
could
call
him
Aemon,
though.”

Gilly
thought
about
that.
“Dalla
brought
him
forth
during
battle,
as
the
swords
sang
all
around
her.
That
should
be
his
name.
Aemon
Battleborn.
Aemon
Steelsong.”

A
name
even
my
lord
father
might
like.
A
warrior’s
name.
The
boy
was
Mance
Rayder’s
son
and
Craster’s
grandson,
after
all.
He
had
none
of
Sam’s
craven
blood.
“Yes.
Call
him
that.”

“When
he
is
two,”
she
promised,
“not
before.”

“Where
is
the
boy?”
Sam
thought
to
ask.
Between
rum
and
sorrow,
it
had
taken
him
that
long
to
realize
that
Gilly
did
not
have
the
babe
with
her.

“Kojja
has
him.
I
asked
her
to
take
him
for
a
while.”

“Oh.”
Kojja
Mo
was
the
captain’s
daughter,
taller
than
Sam
and
slender
as
a
spear,
with
skin
as
black
and
smooth
as
polished
jet.
She
captained
the
ship’s
red
archers
too,
and
pulled
a
double-curved
goldenheart
bow
that
could
send
a
shaft
four
hundred
yards.
When
the
pirates
had
attacked
them
in
the
Stepstones,
Kojja’s
arrows
had
slain
a
dozen
of
them
whilst
Sam’s
own
shafts
were
falling
in
the
water.
The
only
thing
Kojja
Mo
loved
better
than
her
bow
was
bouncing
Dalla’s
boy
upon
her
knee
and
singing
to
him
in
the
Summer
Tongue.
The
wildling
prince
had
become
the
darling
of
all
the
women
in
the
crew,
and
Gilly
seemed
to
trust
them
with
him
as
she
had
never
trusted
any
man.

“That
was
kind
of
Kojja,”
Sam
said.

“I
was
afraid
of
her
at
first,”
said
Gilly.
“She
was
so
black,
and
her
teeth
were
so
big
and
white,
I
was
afraid
she
was
a
beastling
or
a
monster,
but
she’s
not.
She’s
good.
I
like
her.”

“I
know
you
do.”
For
most
of
her
life
the
only
man
Gilly
had
known
had
been
the
terrifying
Craster.
The
rest
of
her
world
had
been
female.
Men
frighten
her,
but
women
don’t,
Sam
realized.
He
could
understand
that.
Back
at
Horn
Hill
he
had
preferred
the
company
of
girls
as
well.
His
sisters
had
been
kind
to
him,
and
though
the
other
girls
would
sometimes
taunt
him,
cruel
words
were
easier
to
shrug
off
than
the
blows
and
buffets
he
got
from
the
other
castle
boys.
Even
now,
on
the
Cinnamon
Wind,
Sam
felt
more
comfortable
with
Kojja
Mo
than
with
her
father,
though
that
might
be
because
she
spoke
the
Common
Tongue
and
he
did
not.

“I
like
you
too,
Sam,”
whispered
Gilly.
“And
I
like
this
drink.
It
tastes
like
fire.”

Yes,
Sam
thought,
a
drink
for
dragons.
Their
cups
were
empty,
so
he
went
over
to
the
cask
and
filled
them
once
again.
The
sun
was
low
in
the
west,
he
saw,
swollen
to
thrice
its
proper
size.
Its
ruddy
light
made
Gilly’s
face
seem
flushed
and
red.
They
drank
a
cup
to
Kojja
Mo,
and
one
to
Dalla’s
boy,
and
one
to
Gilly’s
babe
back
on
the
Wall.
And
after
that
nothing
would
do
but
to
drink
two
cups
for
Aemon
of
House
Targaryen.
“May
the
Father
judge
him
justly,”
Sam
said,
sniffing.
The
sun
was
almost
gone
by
the
time
they
were
done
with
Maester
Aemon.
Only
a
long
thin
line
of
red
still
glowed
upon
the
western
horizon,
like
a
slash
across
the
sky.
Gilly
said
that
the
drink
was
making
the
ship
spin
round,
so
Sam
helped
her
down
the
ladder
to
the
women’s
quarters
in
the
bow
of
the
ship.

There
was
a
lantern
hanging
just
inside
the
cabin,
and
he
managed
to
bang
his
head
on
it
going
in.
“Ow,”
he
said,
and
Gilly
said,
“Are
you
hurt?
Let
me
see.”
She
leaned
close...

...and
kissed
his
mouth.

Sam
found
himself
kissing
her
back.
I
said
the
words,
he
thought,
but
her
hands
were
tugging
at
his
blacks,
pulling
at
the
laces
of
his
breeches.
He
broke
off
the
kiss
long
enough
to
say,
“We
can’t,”
but
Gilly
said,
“We
can,”
and
covered
his
mouth
with
her
own
again.
The
Cinnamon
Wind
was
spinning
all
around
them
and
he
could
taste
the
rum
on
Gilly’s
tongue
and
the
next
thing
her
breasts
were
bare
and
he
was
touching
them.
I
said
the
words,
Sam
thought
again,
but
one
of
her
nipples
found
its
way
between
his
lips.
It
was
pink
and
hard
and
when
he
sucked
on
it
her
milk
filled
his
mouth,
mingling
with
the
taste
of
rum,
and
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
fine
and
sweet
and
good.
If
I
do
this
I
am
no
better
than
Dareon,
Sam
thought,
but
it
felt
too
good
to
stop.
And
suddenly
his
cock
was
out,
jutting
upward
from
his
breeches
like
a
fat
pink
mast.
It
looked
so
silly
standing
there
that
he
might
have
laughed,
but
Gilly
pushed
him
back
onto
her
pallet,
hiked
her
skirts
up
around
her
thighs,
and
lowered
herself
onto
him
with
a
little
whimpery
sound.
That
was
even
better
than
her
nipples.
She’s
so
wet,
he
thought,
gasping.
I
never
knew
a
woman
could
get
so
wet
down
there.
“I
am
your
wife
now,”
she
whispered,
sliding
up
and
down
on
him.
And
Sam
groaned
and
thought,
No,
no,
you
can’t
be,
I
said
the
words,
I
said
the
words,
but
the
only
word
he
said
was,
“Yes.”

Afterward
she
went
to
sleep
with
her
arms
around
him
and
her
face
across
his
chest.
Sam
needed
sleep
as
well,
but
he
was
drunk
on
rum
and
mother’s
milk
and
Gilly.
He
knew
he
ought
to
crawl
back
to
his
own
hammock
in
the
men’s
cabin,
but
she
felt
so
good
curled
up
against
him
that
somehow
he
could
not
move.

Others
came
in,
men
and
women
both,
and
he
listened
to
them
kissing
and
laughing
and
mating
with
one
another.
Summer
Islanders.
That’s
how
they
mourn.
They
answer
death
with
life.
Sam
had
read
that
somewhere,
a
long
time
ago.
He
wondered
if
Gilly
knew,
if
Kojja
Mo
had
told
her
what
to
do.

He
breathed
the
fragrance
of
her
hair
and
stared
at
the
lantern
swinging
overhead.
Even
the
Crone
herself
could
not
lead
me
safely
out
of
this.
The
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
slip
away
and
jump
into
the
sea.
If
I’m
drowned,
no
one
need
ever
know
that
I
shamed
myself
and
broke
my
vows,
and
Gilly
can
find
herself
a
better
man,
one
who
is
not
some
big
fat
coward.

He
awoke
the
next
morning
in
his
own
hammock
in
the
men’s
cabin,
with
Xhondo
bellowing
about
the
wind.
“Wind
is
up,”
the
mate
kept
shouting.
“Wake
and
work,
Black
Sam.
Wind
is
up.”
What
Xhondo
lacked
in
vocabulary
he
made
up
for
in
volume.
Sam
rolled
from
his
hammock
to
his
feet,
and
regretted
it
at
once.
His
head
was
fit
to
split,
one
of
the
blisters
on
his
palm
had
torn
open
in
the
night,
and
he
felt
as
if
he
were
about
to
retch.

Xhondo
had
no
mercy,
though,
so
all
that
Sam
could
do
was
struggle
back
into
his
blacks.
He
found
them
on
the
deck
beneath
his
hammock,
all
bundled
up
in
one
damp
heap.
He
sniffed
at
them
to
see
how
foul
they
were,
and
inhaled
the
smell
of
salt
and
sea
and
tar,
wet
canvas
and
mildew,
fruit
and
fish
and
blackbelly
rum,
strange
spices
and
exotic
woods,
and
a
heady
bouquet
of
his
own
dried
sweat.
But
Gilly’s
smell
was
on
them
too,
the
clean
smell
of
her
hair
and
the
sweet
smell
of
her
milk,
and
that
made
him
glad
to
wear
them.
He
would
have
given
much
and
more
for
warm
dry
socks,
though.
Some
sort
of
fungus
had
begun
to
grow
between
his
toes.

The
chest
of
books
had
not
been
near
enough
to
buy
passage
for
four
from
Braavos
to
Oldtown.
The
Cinnamon
Wind
was
shorthanded,
however,
so
Quhuru
Mo
had
agreed
that
he
would
take
them,
provided
that
they
worked
their
way.
When
Sam
had
protested
that
Maester
Aemon
was
too
weak,
the
boy
a
babe
in
arms,
and
Gilly
terrified
of
the
sea,
Xhondo
only
laughed,
“Black
Sam
is
big
fat
man.
Black
Sam
will
work
for
four.”

If
truth
be
told,
Sam
was
so
fumble-fingered
that
he
doubted
he
was
even
doing
the
work
of
one
good
man,
but
he
did
try.
He
scrubbed
decks
and
rubbed
them
smooth
with
stones,
he
hauled
on
anchor
chains,
he
coiled
rope
and
hunted
rats,
he
sewed
up
torn
sails,
patched
leaks
with
bubbling
hot
tar,
boned
fish
and
chopped
fruit
for
the
cook.
Gilly
tried
as
well.
She
was
better
in
the
rigging
than
Sam
was,
though
from
time
to
time
the
sight
of
so
much
empty
water
still
made
her
close
her
eyes.

Gilly,
Sam
thought,
what
am
I
going
to
do
with
Gilly?

It
was
a
long
hot
sticky
day,
made
longer
by
his
pounding
head.
Sam
busied
himself
with
ropes
and
sails
and
the
other
tasks
that
Xhondo
set
him,
and
tried
not
to
let
his
eyes
wander
to
the
cask
of
rum
that
held
old
Maester
Aemon’s
body...
or
to
Gilly.
He
could
not
face
the
wildling
girl
right
now,
not
after
what
they’d
done
last
night.
When
she
came
up
on
deck
he
went
below.
When
she
went
forward
he
went
aft.
When
she
smiled
at
him
he
turned
away,
feeling
wretched.
I
should
have
jumped
into
the
sea
whilst
she
was
still
asleep,
he
thought.
I
have
always
been
a
craven,
but
I
was
never
an
oathbreaker
till
now.

If
Maester
Aemon
had
not
died,
Sam
could
have
asked
him
what
to
do.
If
Jon
Snow
had
been
aboard,
or
even
Pyp
and
Grenn,
he
might
have
turned
to
them.
Instead
he
had
Xhondo.
Xhondo
would
not
understand
what
I
was
saying.
Or
if
he
did,
he’d
just
tell
me
to
fuck
the
girl
again.
“Fuck”
had
been
the
first
word
of
the
Common
Tongue
that
Xhondo
had
learned,
and
he
was
very
fond
of
it.

He
was
fortunate
that
the
Cinnamon
Wind
was
so
big.
Aboard
the
Blackbird
Gilly
could
have
run
him
down
in
hardly
any
time
at
all.
“Swan
ships,”
the
great
vessels
from
the
Summer
Isles
were
called
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
for
their
billowing
white
sails
and
for
their
figureheads,
most
of
which
depicted
birds.
Large
as
they
were,
they
rode
the
waves
with
a
grace
that
was
all
their
own.
With
a
good
brisk
wind
behind
them,
the
Cinnamon
Wind
could
outrun
any
galley,
though
she
was
helpless
when
becalmed.
And
she
offered
plenty
of
places
for
a
craven
to
hide.

Near
the
end
of
Sam’s
watch,
he
was
finally
cornered.
He
was
climbing
down
a
ladder
when
Xhondo
seized
him
by
the
collar.
“Black
Sam
come
with
Xhondo,”
he
said,
dragging
him
across
the
deck
and
dumping
him
at
the
feet
of
Kojja
Mo.

Far
off
to
the
north,
a
haze
was
visible
low
on
the
horizon.
Kojja
pointed
at
it.
“There
is
the
coast
of
Dorne.
Sand
and
rocks
and
scorpions,
and
no
good
anchorage
for
hundreds
of
leagues.
You
can
swim
there
if
you
like,
and
walk
to
Oldtown.
You
will
need
to
cross
the
deep
desert
and
climb
some
mountains
and
swim
the
Torentine.
Or
else
you
could
go
to
Gilly.”

“You
do
not
understand.
Last
night
we...”

“...honored
your
dead,
and
the
gods
who
made
you
both.
Xhondo
did
the
same.
I
had
the
child,
else
I
would
have
been
with
him.
All
you
Westerosi
make
a
shame
of
loving.
There
is
no
shame
in
loving.
If
your
septons
say
there
is,
your
seven
gods
must
be
demons.
In
the
isles
we
know
better.
Our
gods
gave
us
legs
to
run
with,
noses
to
smell
with,
hands
to
touch
and
feel.
What
mad
cruel
god
would
give
a
man
eyes
and
tell
him
he
must
forever
keep
them
shut,
and
never
look
at
all
the
beauty
in
the
world?
Only
a
monster
god,
a
demon
of
the
darkness.”
Kojja
put
her
hand
between
Sam’s
legs.
“The
gods
gave
you
this
for
a
reason
too,
for...
what
is
your
Westerosi
word?”

“Fucking,”
Xhondo
offered
helpfully.

“Yes,
for
fucking.
For
the
giving
of
pleasure
and
the
making
of
children.
There
is
no
shame
in
that.”

Sam
backed
away
from
her.
“I
took
a
vow.
I
will
take
no
wife,
and
father
no
children.
I
said
the
words.”

“She
knows
the
words
you
said.
She
is
a
child
in
some
ways,
but
she
is
not
blind.
She
knows
why
you
wear
the
black,
why
you
go
to
Oldtown.
She
knows
she
cannot
keep
you.
She
wants
you
for
a
little
while,
is
all.
She
lost
her
father
and
her
husband,
her
mother
and
her
sisters,
her
home,
her
world.
All
she
has
is
you,
and
the
babe.
So
you
go
to
her,
or
swim.”

Sam
looked
despairingly
at
the
haze
that
marked
the
distant
shoreline.
He
could
never
swim
so
far,
he
knew.

He
went
to
Gilly.
“What
we
did...
if
I
could
take
a
wife,
I
would
sooner
have
you
than
any
princess
or
highborn
maiden,
but
I
can’t.
I
am
still
a
crow.
I
said
the
words,
Gilly.
I
went
with
Jon
into
the
woods
and
said
the
words
before
a
heart
tree.”

“The
trees
watch
over
us,”
Gilly
whispered,
brushing
the
tears
from
his
cheeks.
“In
the
forest,
they
see
all...
but
there
are
no
trees
here.
Only
water,
Sam.
Only
water.”





CERSEI

The
day
had
been
cold
and
grey
and
wet.
It
had
poured
all
morning,
and
even
when
the
rain
stopped
that
afternoon
the
clouds
refused
to
part.
They
never
saw
the
sun.
Such
wretched
weather
was
enough
to
discourage
even
the
little
queen.
Instead
of
riding
with
her
hens
and
their
retinue
of
guardsmen
and
admirers,
she
spent
all
day
in
the
Maidenvault
with
her
hens,
listening
to
the
Blue
Bard
sing.

Cersei’s
own
day
was
little
better,
till
evenfall.
As
the
grey
sky
began
to
fade
to
black,
they
told
her
that
the
Sweet
Cersei
had
come
in
on
the
evening
tide,
and
that
Aurane
Waters
was
without,
begging
audience.

The
queen
sent
for
him
at
once.
As
soon
as
he
strode
into
her
solar,
she
knew
his
tidings
were
good.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said
with
a
broad
smile,
“Dragonstone
is
yours.”

“How
splendid.”
She
took
his
hands
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheeks.
“I
know
Tommen
will
be
pleased
as
well.
This
will
mean
that
we
can
release
Lord
Redwyne’s
fleet,
and
drive
the
ironmen
from
the
Shields.”
The
news
from
the
Reach
seemed
to
grow
more
dire
with
every
raven.
The
ironmen
had
not
been
content
with
their
new
rocks,
it
seemed.
They
were
raiding
up
the
Mander
in
strength,
and
had
gone
so
far
as
to
attack
the
Arbor
and
the
smaller
islands
that
surrounded
it.
The
Redwynes
had
kept
no
more
than
a
dozen
warships
in
their
home
waters,
and
all
those
had
been
overwhelmed,
taken,
or
sunk.
And
now
there
were
reports
that
this
madman
who
called
himself
Euron
Crow’s
Eye
was
even
sending
longships
up
Whispering
Sound
toward
Oldtown.

“Lord
Paxter
was
taking
on
provisions
for
the
voyage
home
when
Sweet
Cersei
raised
sail,”
Lord
Waters
reported.
“I
would
imagine
that
by
now
his
main
fleet
has
put
to
sea.”

“Let
us
hope
they
enjoy
a
swift
voyage,
and
better
weather
than
today.”
The
queen
drew
Waters
down
into
the
window
seat
beside
her.
“Do
we
have
Ser
Loras
to
thank
for
this
triumph?”

His
smile
vanished.
“Some
will
say
so,
Your
Grace.”

“Some?”
She
gave
him
a
quizzical
look.
“Not
you?”

“I
never
saw
a
braver
knight,”
Waters
said,
“but
he
turned
what
could
have
been
a
bloodless
victory
into
a
slaughter.
A
thousand
men
are
dead,
or
near
enough
to
make
no
matter.
Most
of
them
our
own.
And
not
just
common
men,
Your
Grace,
but
knights
and
young
lords,
the
best
and
the
bravest.”

“And
Ser
Loras
himself?”

“He
will
make
a
thousand
and
one.
They
carried
him
inside
the
castle
after
the
battle,
but
his
wounds
are
grievous.
He
has
lost
so
much
blood
that
the
maesters
will
not
even
leech
him.”

“Oh,
how
sad.
Tommen
will
be
heartbroken.
He
did
so
admire
our
gallant
Knight
of
Flowers.”

“The
smallfolk
too,”
her
admiral
said.
“We’ll
have
maidens
weeping
into
their
wine
all
across
the
realm
when
Loras
dies.”

He
was
not
wrong,
the
queen
knew.
Three
thousand
smallfolk
had
crowded
through
the
Mud
Gate
to
see
Ser
Loras
off
the
day
he
sailed,
and
three
of
every
four
were
women.
The
sight
had
only
served
to
fill
her
with
contempt.
She
had
wanted
to
scream
at
them
that
they
were
sheep,
to
tell
them
that
all
that
they
could
ever
hope
to
get
from
Loras
Tyrell
was
a
smile
and
a
flower.
Instead
she
had
proclaimed
him
the
boldest
knight
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
smiled
as
Tommen
presented
him
with
a
jeweled
sword
to
carry
into
battle.
The
king
had
given
him
a
hug
as
well,
which
had
not
been
part
of
Cersei’s
plans,
but
it
made
no
matter
now.
She
could
afford
to
be
generous.
Loras
Tyrell
was
dying.

“Tell
me,”
Cersei
commanded.
“I
want
to
know
all
of
it,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end.”

The
room
had
grown
dark
by
the
time
that
he
was
done.
The
queen
lit
some
candles
and
sent
Dorcas
to
the
kitchens
to
bring
them
up
some
bread
and
cheese
and
a
bit
of
boiled
beef
with
horseradish.
As
they
supped,
she
bid
Aurane
to
tell
the
tale
again,
so
she
would
remember
all
the
details
correctly.
“I
do
not
want
our
precious
Margaery
to
hear
these
tidings
from
a
stranger,
after
all,”
she
said.
“I
will
tell
her
myself.”

“Your
Grace
is
kind,”
said
Waters
with
a
smile.
A
wicked
smile,
the
queen
thought.
Aurane
did
not
resemble
Prince
Rhaegar
as
much
as
she
had
thought.
He
has
the
hair,
but
so
do
half
the
whores
in
Lys,
if
the
tales
are
true.
Rhaegar
was
a
man.
This
is
a
sly
boy,
no
more.
Useful
in
his
way,
though.

Margaery
was
in
the
Maidenvault,
sipping
wine
and
trying
to
puzzle
out
some
new
game
from
Volantis
with
her
three
cousins.
Though
the
hour
was
late,
the
guards
admitted
Cersei
at
once.
“Your
Grace,”
she
began,
“it
is
best
you
hear
the
news
from
me.
Aurane
is
back
from
Dragonstone.
Your
brother
is
a
hero.”

“I
always
knew
he
was.”
Margaery
did
not
seem
surprised.
Why
should
she?
She
expected
this,
from
the
moment
Loras
begged
for
the
command.
Yet
by
the
time
Cersei
had
finished
with
her
tale,
tears
glistened
on
the
cheeks
of
the
younger
queen.
“Redwyne
had
miners
working
to
drive
a
tunnel
underneath
the
castle
walls,
but
that
was
too
slow
for
the
Knight
of
Flowers.
No
doubt
he
was
thinking
of
your
lord
father’s
people
suffering
on
the
Shields.
Lord
Waters
says
he
ordered
the
assault
not
half
a
day
after
taking
command,
after
Lord
Stannis’s
castellan
refused
his
offer
to
settle
the
siege
between
them
in
single
combat.
Loras
was
the
first
one
through
the
breach
when
the
ram
broke
the
castle
gates.
He
rode
straight
into
the
dragon’s
mouth,
they
say,
all
in
white
and
swinging
his
morningstar
about
his
head,
slaying
left
and
right.”

Megga
Tyrell
was
sobbing
openly
by
then.
“How
did
he
die?”
she
asked.
“Who
killed
him?”

“No
one
man
has
that
honor,”
said
Cersei.
“Ser
Loras
took
a
quarrel
through
the
thigh
and
another
through
the
shoulder,
but
he
fought
on
gallantly,
though
the
blood
was
streaming
from
him.
Later
he
suffered
a
mace
blow
that
broke
some
ribs.
After
that...
but
no,
I
would
spare
you
the
worst
of
it.”

“Tell
me,”
said
Margaery.
“I
command
it.”

Command
it?
Cersei
paused
a
moment,
then
decided
she
would
let
that
pass.
“The
defenders
fell
back
to
an
inner
keep
once
the
curtain
wall
was
taken.
Loras
led
the
attack
there
as
well.
He
was
doused
with
boiling
oil.”

Lady
Alla
turned
white
as
chalk,
and
ran
from
the
room.

“The
maesters
are
doing
all
they
can,
Lord
Waters
assures
me,
but
I
fear
your
brother
is
too
badly
burned.”
Cersei
took
Margaery
in
her
arms
to
comfort
her.
“He
saved
the
realm.”
When
she
kissed
the
little
queen
upon
the
cheek,
she
could
taste
the
salt
of
her
tears.
“Jaime
will
enter
all
his
deeds
in
the
White
Book,
and
the
singers
will
sing
of
him
for
a
thousand
years.”

Margaery
wrenched
free
of
her
embrace,
so
violently
that
Cersei
almost
fell.
“Dying
is
not
dead,”
she
said.

“No,
but
the
maesters
say—”

“Dying
is
not
dead!”

“I
only
want
to
spare
you—”

“I
know
what
you
want.
Get
out.”

Now
you
know
how
I
felt,
the
night
my
Joffrey
died.
She
bowed,
her
face
a
mask
of
cool
courtesy.
“Sweet
daughter.
I
am
so
sad
for
you.
I
will
leave
you
with
your
grief.”

Lady
Merryweather
did
not
appear
that
night,
and
Cersei
found
herself
too
restless
to
sleep.
If
Lord
Tywin
could
see
me
now,
he
would
know
he
had
his
heir,
an
heir
worthy
of
the
Rock,
she
thought
as
she
lay
abed
with
Jocelyn
Swyft
snoring
softly
into
the
other
pillow.
Margaery
would
soon
be
weeping
the
bitter
tears
she
should
have
wept
for
Joffrey.
Mace
Tyrell
might
weep
as
well,
but
she
had
given
him
no
cause
to
break
with
her.
What
had
she
done,
after
all,
but
honor
Loras
with
her
trust?
He
had
requested
the
command
on
bended
knee
whilst
half
her
court
looked
on.

When
he
dies
I
must
raise
a
statue
of
him
somewhere,
and
give
him
a
funeral
such
as
King’s
Landing
has
never
seen.
The
smallfolk
would
like
that.
So
would
Tommen.
Mace
may
even
thank
me,
poor
man.
As
for
his
lady
mother,
if
the
gods
are
good
this
news
will
kill
her.

The
sunrise
was
the
prettiest
that
Cersei
had
seen
in
years.
Taena
appeared
soon
thereafter,
and
confessed
to
having
spent
the
night
consoling
Margaery
and
her
ladies,
drinking
wine
and
crying
and
telling
tales
of
Loras.
“Margaery
is
still
convinced
he
will
not
die,”
she
reported,
as
the
queen
was
dressed
for
court.
“She
plans
to
send
her
own
maester
to
look
after
him.
The
cousins
are
praying
for
the
Mother’s
mercy.”

“I
shall
pray
as
well.
On
the
morrow,
come
with
me
to
Baelor’s
Sept,
and
we
will
light
a
hundred
candles
for
our
gallant
Knight
of
Flowers.”
She
turned
to
her
handmaid.
“Dorcas,
bring
my
crown.
The
new
one,
if
you
please.”
It
was
lighter
than
the
old,
pale
spun
gold
set
with
emeralds
that
sparkled
when
she
turned
her
head.

“There
are
four
come
about
the
Imp
this
morning,”
Ser
Osmund
said,
when
Jocelyn
admitted
him.

“Four?”
The
queen
was
pleasantly
surprised.
A
steady
stream
of
informers
had
been
making
their
way
to
the
Red
Keep,
claiming
knowledge
of
Tyrion,
but
four
in
one
day
was
unusual.

“Aye,”
said
Osmund.
“One
brought
a
head
for
you.”

“I
will
see
him
first.
Bring
him
to
my
solar.”
This
time,
let
there
be
no
mistakes.
Let
me
be
avenged
at
long
last,
so
Joff
can
rest
in
peace.
The
septons
said
that
the
number
seven
was
sacred
to
the
gods.
If
so,
perhaps
this
seventh
head
would
bring
her
the
balm
her
soul
desired.

The
man
proved
to
be
Tyroshi;
short
and
stout
and
sweaty,
with
an
unctuous
smile
that
reminded
her
of
Varys
and
a
forked
beard
dyed
green
and
pink.
Cersei
misliked
him
on
sight,
but
was
willing
to
overlook
his
flaws
if
he
actually
had
Tyrion’s
head
inside
the
chest
he
carried.
It
was
cedar,
inlaid
with
ivory
in
a
pattern
of
vines
and
flowers,
with
hinges
and
clasps
of
white
gold.
A
lovely
thing,
but
the
queen’s
only
interest
lay
in
what
might
be
within.
It
is
big
enough,
at
least.
Tyrion
had
a
grotesquely
large
head,
for
one
so
small
and
stunted.

“Your
Grace,”
the
Tyroshi
murmured,
bowing
low,
“I
see
you
are
as
lovely
as
the
tales.
Even
beyond
the
narrow
sea
we
have
heard
of
your
great
beauty,
and
the
grief
that
tears
your
gentle
heart.
No
man
can
restore
your
brave
young
son
to
you,
but
it
is
my
hope
I
can
at
least
offer
you
some
balm
for
your
pain.”
He
laid
his
hand
upon
his
chest.
“I
bring
you
justice.
I
bring
you
the
head
of
your
valonqar.”

The
old
Valyrian
word
sent
a
chill
through
her,
though
it
also
gave
her
a
tingle
of
hope.
“The
Imp
is
no
longer
my
brother,
if
he
ever
was,”
she
declared.
“Nor
will
I
say
his
name.
It
was
a
proud
name
once,
before
he
dishonored
it.”

“In
Tyrosh
we
name
him
Redhands,
for
the
blood
running
from
his
fingers.
A
king’s
blood,
and
a
father’s.
Some
say
he
slew
his
mother
too,
ripping
his
way
from
her
womb
with
savage
claws.”

What
nonsense,
Cersei
thought.
“’Tis
true,”
she
said.
“If
the
Imp’s
head
is
in
that
chest,
I
shall
raise
you
to
lordship
and
grant
you
rich
lands
and
keeps.”
Titles
were
cheaper
than
dirt,
and
the
riverlands
were
full
of
ruined
castles,
standing
desolate
amidst
untended
fields
and
burned
villages.
“My
court
awaits.
Open
the
box
and
let
us
see.”

The
Tyroshi
threw
open
the
box
with
a
flourish,
and
stepped
back
smiling.
Within,
the
head
of
a
dwarf
reposed
upon
a
bed
of
soft
blue
velvet,
staring
up
at
her.

Cersei
took
a
long
look.
“That
is
not
my
brother.”
There
was
a
sour
taste
in
her
mouth.
I
suppose
it
was
too
much
to
hope
for,
especially
after
Loras.
The
gods
are
never
that
good.
“This
man
has
brown
eyes.
Tyrion
had
one
black
eye
and
one
green.”

“The
eyes,
just
so...
Your
Grace,
your
brother’s
own
eyes
had...
somewhat
decayed.
I
took
the
liberty
of
replacing
them
with
glass...
but
of
the
wrong
color,
as
you
say.”

That
only
annoyed
her
further.
“Your
head
may
have
glass
eyes,
but
I
do
not.
There
are
gargoyles
on
Dragonstone
that
look
more
like
the
Imp
than
this
creature.
He’s
bald,
and
twice
my
brother’s
age.
What
happened
to
his
teeth?”

The
man
shrank
before
the
fury
in
her
voice.
“He
had
a
fine
set
of
gold
teeth,
Your
Grace,
but
we...
I
regret...”

“Oh,
not
yet.
But
you
will.”
I
ought
to
have
him
strangled.
Let
him
gasp
for
breath
until
his
face
turns
black,
the
way
my
sweet
son
did.
The
words
were
on
her
lips.

“An
honest
mistake.
One
dwarf
looks
so
much
like
another,
and...
Your
Grace
will
observe,
he
has
no
nose...”

“He
has
no
nose
because
you
cut
it
off.”

“No!”
The
sweat
on
his
brow
gave
the
lie
to
his
denial.

“Yes.”
A
poisonous
sweetness
crept
into
Cersei’s
tone.
“At
least
you
had
that
much
sense.
The
last
fool
tried
to
tell
me
that
a
hedge
wizard
had
regrown
it.
Still,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
owe
this
dwarf
a
nose.
House
Lannister
pays
its
debts,
and
so
shall
you.
Ser
Meryn,
take
this
fraud
to
Qyburn.”

Ser
Meryn
Trant
took
the
Tyroshi
by
the
arm
and
hauled
him
off,
still
protesting.
When
they
were
gone,
Cersei
turned
to
Osmund
Kettleblack.
“Ser
Osmund,
get
this
thing
out
of
my
sight,
and
bring
in
the
other
three
who
claim
knowledge
of
the
Imp.”

“Aye,
Your
Grace.”

Sad
to
say,
the
three
would-be
informers
proved
no
more
useful
than
the
Tyroshi.
One
said
that
the
Imp
was
hiding
in
an
Oldtown
brothel,
pleasuring
men
with
his
mouth.
It
made
for
a
droll
picture,
but
Cersei
did
not
believe
it
for
an
instant.
The
second
claimed
to
have
seen
the
dwarf
in
a
mummer’s
show
in
Braavos.
The
third
insisted
Tyrion
had
become
a
hermit
in
the
riverlands,
living
on
some
haunted
hill.
The
queen
made
the
same
response
to
each.
“If
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
lead
some
of
my
brave
knights
to
this
dwarf,
you
shall
be
richly
rewarded,”
she
promised.
“Provided
that
it
is
the
Imp.
If
not...
well,
my
knights
have
little
patience
for
deception,
nor
fools
who
send
them
chasing
after
shadows.
A
man
could
lose
his
tongue.”
And
quick
as
that,
all
three
informers
suddenly
lost
faith,
and
allowed
that
perhaps
it
might
have
been
some
other
dwarf
they
saw.

Cersei
had
never
realized
there
were
so
many
dwarfs.
“Is
the
whole
world
overrun
with
these
twisted
little
monsters?”
she
complained,
whilst
the
last
of
the
informers
was
being
ushered
out.
“How
many
of
them
can
there
be?”

“Fewer
than
there
were,”
said
Lady
Merryweather.
“May
I
have
the
honor
of
accompanying
Your
Grace
to
court?”

“If
you
can
bear
the
tedium,”
said
Cersei.
“Robert
was
a
fool
about
most
things,
but
he
was
right
in
one
regard.
It
is
wearisome
work
to
rule
a
kingdom.”

“It
saddens
me
to
see
Your
Grace
so
careworn.
I
say,
run
off
and
play
and
leave
the
King’s
Hand
to
hear
these
tiresome
petitions.
We
could
dress
as
serving
girls
and
spend
the
day
amongst
the
smallfolk,
to
hear
what
they
are
saying
of
the
fall
of
Dragonstone.
I
know
the
inn
where
the
Blue
Bard
plays
when
he
is
not
singing
attendance
on
the
little
queen,
and
a
certain
cellar
where
a
conjurer
turns
lead
into
gold,
water
into
wine,
and
girls
into
boys.
Perhaps
he
would
work
his
spells
on
the
two
of
us.
Would
it
amuse
Your
Grace
to
be
a
man
one
night?”

If
I
were
a
man
I
would
be
Jaime,
the
queen
thought.
If
I
were
a
man
I
could
rule
this
realm
in
my
own
name
in
place
of
Tommen’s.
“Only
if
you
remained
a
woman,”
she
said,
knowing
that
was
what
Taena
wanted
to
hear.
“You
are
a
wicked
thing
to
tempt
me
so,
but
what
sort
of
queen
would
I
be
if
I
put
my
realm
in
the
trembling
hands
of
Harys
Swyft?”

Taena
pouted.
“Your
Grace
is
too
diligent.”

“I
am,”
Cersei
allowed,
“and
by
day’s
end
I
shall
rue
it.”
She
slipped
her
arm
through
Lady
Merryweather’s.
“Come.”

Jalabhar
Xho
was
the
first
to
petition
her
that
day,
as
befit
his
rank
as
a
prince
in
exile.
Splendid
as
he
looked
in
his
bright
feathered
cloak,
he
had
only
come
to
beg.
Cersei
let
him
make
his
usual
plea
for
men
and
arms
to
help
him
regain
Red
Flower
Vale,
then
said,
“His
Grace
is
fighting
his
own
war,
Prince
Jalabhar.
He
has
no
men
to
spare
for
yours
just
now.
Next
year,
perhaps.”
That
was
what
Robert
always
told
him.
Next
year
she
would
tell
him
never,
but
not
today.
Dragonstone
was
hers.

Lord
Hallyne
of
the
Guild
of
Alchemists
presented
himself,
to
ask
that
his
pyromancers
be
allowed
to
hatch
any
dragon’s
eggs
that
might
turn
up
upon
Dragonstone,
now
that
the
isle
was
safely
back
in
royal
hands.
“If
any
such
eggs
remained,
Stannis
would
have
sold
them
to
pay
for
his
rebellion,”
the
queen
told
him.
She
refrained
from
saying
that
the
plan
was
mad.
Ever
since
the
last
Targaryen
dragon
had
died,
all
such
attempts
had
ended
in
death,
disaster,
or
disgrace.

A
group
of
merchants
appeared
before
her
to
beg
the
throne
to
intercede
for
them
with
the
Iron
Bank
of
Braavos.
The
Braavosi
were
demanding
repayment
of
their
outstanding
debts,
it
seemed,
and
refusing
all
new
loans.
We
need
our
own
bank,
Cersei
decided,
the
Golden
Bank
of
Lannisport.
Perhaps
when
Tommen’s
throne
was
secure,
she
could
make
that
happen.
For
the
nonce,
all
she
could
do
was
tell
the
merchants
to
pay
the
Braavosi
usurers
their
due.

The
delegation
from
the
Faith
was
headed
by
her
old
friend
Septon
Raynard.
Six
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons
escorted
him
across
the
city;
together
they
were
seven,
a
holy
and
propitious
number.
The
new
High
Septon—or
High
Sparrow,
as
Moon
Boy
had
dubbed
him—did
everything
by
sevens.
The
knights
wore
swordbelts
striped
in
the
seven
colors
of
the
Faith.
Crystals
adorned
the
pommels
of
their
longswords
and
the
crests
of
their
greathelms.
They
carried
kite
shields
of
a
style
not
common
since
the
Conquest,
displaying
a
device
not
seen
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
for
centuries:
a
rainbow
sword
shining
bright
upon
a
field
of
darkness.
Close
to
a
hundred
knights
had
already
come
forth
to
pledge
their
lives
and
swords
to
the
Warrior’s
Sons,
Qyburn
claimed,
and
more
turned
up
every
day.
Drunk
on
the
gods,
the
lot
of
them.
Who
would
have
thought
the
realm
contained
so
many
of
them?

Most
had
been
household
knights
and
hedge
knights,
but
a
handful
were
of
high
birth;
younger
sons,
petty
lords,
old
men
wanting
to
atone
for
the
old
sins.
And
then
there
was
Lancel.
She
had
thought
Qyburn
must
be
japing
when
he
had
told
her
that
her
mooncalf
cousin
had
forsaken
castle,
lands,
and
wife
and
wandered
back
to
the
city
to
join
the
Noble
and
Puissant
Order
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons,
yet
there
he
stood
with
the
other
pious
fools.

Cersei
liked
that
not
at
all.
Nor
was
she
pleased
by
the
High
Sparrow’s
endless
truculence
and
ingratitude.
“Where
is
the
High
Septon?”
she
demanded
of
Raynard.
“It
was
him
I
summoned.”

Septon
Raynard
assumed
a
regretful
tone.
“His
High
Holiness
sent
me
in
his
stead,
and
bade
me
tell
Your
Grace
that
the
Seven
have
sent
him
forth
to
battle
wickedness.”

“How?
By
preaching
chastity
along
the
Street
of
Silk?
Does
he
think
praying
over
whores
will
turn
them
back
to
virgins?”

“Our
bodies
were
shaped
by
our
Father
and
Mother
so
we
might
join
male
to
female
and
beget
trueborn
children,”
Raynard
replied.
“It
is
base
and
sinful
for
women
to
sell
their
holy
parts
for
coin.”

The
pious
sentiment
would
have
been
more
convincing
if
the
queen
had
not
known
that
Septon
Raynard
had
special
friends
in
every
brothel
on
the
Street
of
Silk.
No
doubt
he
had
decided
that
echoing
the
High
Sparrow’s
twitterings
was
preferable
to
scrubbing
floors.
“Do
not
presume
to
preach
at
me,”
she
told
him.
“The
brothel
keepers
have
been
complaining,
and
rightly
so.”

“If
sinners
speak,
why
should
the
righteous
listen?”

“These
sinners
feed
the
royal
coffers,”
the
queen
said
bluntly,
“and
their
pennies
help
pay
the
wages
of
my
gold
cloaks
and
build
galleys
to
defend
our
shores.
There
is
trade
to
be
considered
as
well.
If
King’s
Landing
had
no
brothels,
the
ships
would
go
to
Duskendale
or
Gulltown.
His
High
Holiness
promised
me
peace
in
my
streets.
Whoring
helps
to
keep
that
peace.
Common
men
deprived
of
whores
are
apt
to
turn
to
rape.
Henceforth
let
His
High
Holiness
do
his
praying
in
the
sept
where
it
belongs.”

The
queen
had
expected
to
hear
from
Lord
Gyles
as
well,
but
instead
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
appeared,
grey-faced
and
apologetic,
to
tell
her
that
Rosby
was
too
weak
to
leave
his
bed.
“Sad
to
say,
I
fear
Lord
Gyles
must
join
his
noble
forebears
soon.
May
the
Father
judge
him
justly.”

If
Rosby
dies,
Mace
Tyrell
and
the
little
queen
will
try
and
force
Garth
the
Gross
on
me
again.
“Lord
Gyles
has
had
that
cough
for
years,
and
it
never
killed
him
before,”
she
complained.
“He
coughed
through
half
of
Robert’s
reign
and
all
of
Joffrey’s.
If
he
is
dying
now,
it
can
only
be
because
someone
wants
him
dead.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
blinked
in
disbelief.
“Your
Grace?
Wh-who
would
want
Lord
Gyles
dead?”

“His
heir,
perhaps.”
Or
the
little
queen.
“Some
woman
he
once
scorned.”
Margaery
and
Mace
and
the
Queen
of
Thorns,
why
not?
Gyles
is
in
their
way.
“An
old
enemy.
A
new
one.
You.”

The
old
man
blanched.
“Y-your
Grace
japes.
I...
I
have
purged
his
lordship,
bled
him,
treated
him
with
poultices
and
infusions...
the
mists
give
him
some
relief
and
sweetsleep
helps
with
the
violence
of
his
coughing,
but
he
is
bringing
up
bits
of
lung
with
the
blood
now,
I
fear.”

“Be
that
as
it
may.
You
will
return
to
Lord
Gyles
and
inform
him
that
he
does
not
have
my
leave
to
die.”

“If
it
please
Your
Grace.”
Pycelle
bowed
stiffly.

There
was
more,
and
more,
and
more,
each
petitioner
more
boring
than
the
last.
And
that
evening,
when
the
last
of
them
had
finally
gone
and
she
was
eating
a
simple
supper
with
her
son,
she
told
him,
“Tommen,
when
you
say
your
prayers
before
bed,
tell
the
Mother
and
the
Father
that
you
are
thankful
you
are
still
a
child.
Being
king
is
hard
work.
I
promise
you,
you
will
not
like
it.
They
peck
at
you
like
a
murder
of
crows.
Every
one
wants
a
piece
of
your
flesh.”

“Yes,
Mother,”
said
Tommen,
in
a
sad
tone.
The
little
queen
had
told
him
of
Ser
Loras,
she
understood.
Ser
Osmund
said
the
boy
had
wept.
He
is
young.
By
the
time
he
is
Joff’s
age
he
will
not
recall
what
Loras
looked
like.
“I
wouldn’t
mind
them
pecking,
though,”
her
son
went
on
to
say.
“I
should
go
to
court
with
you
every
day,
to
listen.
Margaery
says—”

“—a
deal
too
much,”
Cersei
snapped.
“For
half
a
groat
I’d
gladly
have
her
tongue
torn
out.”

“Don’t
you
say
that,”
Tommen
shouted
suddenly,
his
round
little
face
turning
red.
“You
leave
her
tongue
alone.
Don’t
you
touch
her.
I’m
the
king,
not
you.”

She
stared
at
him,
incredulous.
“What
did
you
say?”

“I’m
the
king.
I
get
to
say
who
has
their
tongues
torn
out,
not
you.
I
won’t
let
you
hurt
Margaery.
I
won’t.
I
forbid
it.”

Cersei
took
him
by
the
ear
and
dragged
him
squealing
to
the
door,
where
she
found
Ser
Boros
Blount
standing
guard.
“Ser
Boros,
His
Grace
has
forgotten
himself.
Kindly
escort
him
to
his
bedchamber
and
bring
up
Pate.
This
time
I
want
Tommen
to
whip
the
boy
himself.
He
is
to
continue
until
the
boy
is
bleeding
from
both
cheeks.
If
His
Grace
refuses,
or
says
one
word
of
protest,
summon
Qyburn
and
tell
him
to
remove
Pate’s
tongue,
so
His
Grace
can
learn
the
cost
of
insolence.”

“As
you
command,”
Ser
Boros
huffed,
glancing
at
the
king
uneasily.
“Your
Grace,
please
come
with
me.”

As
night
fell
over
the
Red
Keep,
Jocelyn
kindled
a
fire
in
the
queen’s
hearth
whilst
Dorcas
lit
the
bedside
candles.
Cersei
opened
the
window
for
a
breath
of
air,
and
found
that
the
clouds
had
rolled
back
in
to
hide
the
stars.
“Such
a
dark
night,
Your
Grace,”
murmured
Dorcas.

Aye,
she
thought,
but
not
so
dark
as
in
the
Maidenvault,
or
on
Dragonstone
where
Loras
Tyrell
lies
burned
and
bleeding,
or
down
in
the
black
cells
beneath
the
castle.
The
queen
did
not
know
why
that
occurred
to
her.
She
had
resolved
not
to
give
Falyse
another
thought.
Single
combat.
Falyse
should
have
known
better
than
to
marry
such
a
fool.
The
word
from
Stokeworth
was
that
Lady
Tanda
had
died
of
a
chill
in
the
chest,
brought
on
by
her
broken
hip.
Lollys
Lackwit
had
been
proclaimed
Lady
Stokeworth,
with
Ser
Bronn
her
lord.
Tanda
dead
and
Gyles
dying.
It
is
well
that
we
have
Moon
Boy,
or
the
court
would
be
entirely
bereft
of
fools.
The
queen
smiled
as
she
lay
her
head
upon
the
pillow.
When
I
kissed
her
cheek,
I
could
taste
the
salt
of
her
tears.

She
dreamt
an
old
dream,
of
three
girls
in
brown
cloaks,
a
wattled
crone,
and
a
tent
that
smelled
of
death.

The
crone’s
tent
was
dark,
with
a
tall
peaked
roof.
She
did
not
want
to
go
in,
no
more
than
she
had
wanted
to
at
ten,
but
the
other
girls
were
watching
her,
so
she
could
not
turn
away.
They
were
three
in
the
dream,
as
they
had
been
in
life.
Fat
Jeyne
Farman
hung
back
as
she
always
did.
It
was
a
wonder
she
had
come
this
far.
Melara
Hetherspoon
was
bolder,
older,
and
prettier,
in
a
freckly
sort
of
way.
Wrapped
in
roughspun
cloaks
with
their
hoods
pulled
up,
the
three
of
them
had
stolen
from
their
beds
and
crossed
the
tourney
grounds
to
seek
the
sorceress.
Melara
had
heard
the
serving
girls
whispering
how
she
could
curse
a
man
or
make
him
fall
in
love,
summon
demons
and
foretell
the
future.

In
life
the
girls
had
been
breathless
and
giddy,
whispering
to
each
other
as
they
went,
as
excited
as
they
were
afraid.
The
dream
was
different.
In
the
dream
the
pavilions
were
shadowed,
and
the
knights
and
serving
men
they
passed
were
made
of
mist.
The
girls
wandered
for
a
long
while
before
they
found
the
crone’s
tent.
By
the
time
they
did
all
the
torches
were
guttering
out.
Cersei
watched
the
girls
huddling,
whispering
to
one
another.
Go
back,
she
tried
to
tell
them.
Turn
away.
There
is
nothing
here
for
you.
But
though
she
moved
her
mouth,
no
words
came
out.

Lord
Tywin’s
daughter
was
the
first
through
the
flap,
with
Melara
close
behind
her.
Jeyne
Farman
came
last,
and
tried
to
hide
behind
the
other
two,
the
way
she
always
did.

The
inside
of
the
tent
was
full
of
smells.
Cinnamon
and
nutmeg.
Pepper,
red
and
white
and
black.
Almond
milk
and
onions.
Cloves
and
lemongrass
and
precious
saffron,
and
stranger
spices,
rarer
still.
The
only
light
came
from
an
iron
brazier
shaped
like
a
basilisk’s
head,
a
dim
green
light
that
made
the
walls
of
the
tent
look
cold
and
dead
and
rotten.
Had
it
been
that
way
in
life
as
well?
Cersei
could
not
seem
to
remember.

The
sorceress
was
sleeping
in
the
dream,
as
once
she’d
slept
in
life.
Leave
her
be,
the
queen
wanted
to
cry
out.
You
little
fools,
never
wake
a
sleeping
sorceress.
Without
a
tongue,
she
could
only
watch
as
the
girl
threw
off
her
cloak,
kicked
the
witch’s
bed,
and
said,
“Wake
up,
we
want
our
futures
told.”

When
Maggy
the
Frog
opened
her
eyes,
Jeyne
Farman
gave
a
frightened
squeak
and
fled
the
tent,
plunging
headlong
back
into
the
night.
Plump
stupid
timid
little
Jeyne,
pasty-faced
and
fat
and
scared
of
every
shadow.
She
was
the
wise
one,
though.
Jeyne
lived
on
Fair
Isle
still.
She
had
married
one
of
her
lord
brother’s
bannermen
and
whelped
a
dozen
children.

The
old
woman’s
eyes
were
yellow,
and
crusted
all
about
with
something
vile.
In
Lannisport
it
was
said
that
she
had
been
young
and
beautiful
when
her
husband
had
brought
her
back
from
the
east
with
a
load
of
spices,
but
age
and
evil
had
left
their
marks
on
her.
She
was
short,
squat,
and
warty,
with
pebbly
greenish
jowls.
Her
teeth
were
gone
and
her
dugs
hung
down
to
her
knees.
You
could
smell
sickness
on
her
if
you
stood
too
close,
and
when
she
spoke
her
breath
was
strange
and
strong
and
foul.
“Begone,”
she
told
the
girls,
in
a
croaking
whisper.

“We
came
for
a
foretelling,”
young
Cersei
told
her.

“Begone,”
croaked
the
old
woman,
a
second
time.

“We
heard
that
you
can
see
into
the
morrow,”
said
Melara.
“We
just
want
to
know
what
men
we’re
going
to
marry.”

“Begone,”
croaked
Maggy,
a
third
time.

Listen
to
her,
the
queen
would
have
cried
if
she
had
her
tongue.
You
still
have
time
to
flee.
Run,
you
little
fools!

The
girl
with
the
golden
curls
put
her
hands
upon
her
hips.
“Give
us
our
foretelling,
or
I’ll
go
to
my
lord
father
and
have
you
whipped
for
insolence.”

“Please,”
begged
Melara.
“Just
tell
us
our
futures,
then
we’ll
go.”

“Some
are
here
who
have
no
futures,”
Maggy
muttered
in
her
terrible
deep
voice.
She
pulled
her
robe
about
her
shoulders
and
beckoned
the
girls
closer.
“Come,
if
you
will
not
go.
Fools.
Come,
yes.
I
must
taste
your
blood.”

Melara
paled,
but
not
Cersei.
A
lioness
does
not
fear
a
frog,
no
matter
how
old
and
ugly
she
might
be.
She
should
have
gone,
she
should
have
listened,
she
should
have
run
away.
Instead
she
took
the
dagger
Maggy
offered
her,
and
ran
the
twisted
iron
blade
across
the
ball
of
her
thumb.
Then
she
did
Melara
too.

In
the
dim
green
tent,
the
blood
seemed
more
black
than
red.
Maggy’s
toothless
mouth
trembled
at
the
sight
of
it.
“Here,”
she
whispered,
“give
it
here.”
When
Cersei
offered
her
hand,
she
sucked
away
the
blood
with
gums
as
soft
as
a
newborn
babe’s.
The
queen
could
still
remember
how
queer
and
cold
her
mouth
had
been.

“Three
questions
may
you
ask,”
the
crone
said,
once
she’d
had
her
drink.
“You
will
not
like
my
answers.
Ask,
or
begone
with
you.”

Go,
the
dreaming
queen
thought,
hold
your
tongue,
and
flee.
But
the
girl
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
be
afraid.

“When
will
I
wed
the
prince?”
she
asked.

“Never.
You
will
wed
the
king.”

Beneath
her
golden
curls,
the
girl’s
face
wrinkled
up
in
puzzlement.
For
years
after,
she
took
those
words
to
mean
that
she
would
not
marry
Rhaegar
until
after
his
father
Aerys
had
died.
“I
will
be
queen,
though?”
asked
the
younger
her.

“Aye.”
Malice
gleamed
in
Maggy’s
yellow
eyes.
“Queen
you
shall
be...
until
there
comes
another,
younger
and
more
beautiful,
to
cast
you
down
and
take
all
that
you
hold
dear.”

Anger
flashed
across
the
child’s
face.
“If
she
tries
I
will
have
my
brother
kill
her.”
Even
then
she
would
not
stop,
willful
child
as
she
was.
She
still
had
one
more
question
due
her,
one
more
glimpse
into
her
life
to
come.
“Will
the
king
and
I
have
children?”
she
asked.

“Oh,
aye.
Six-and-ten
for
him,
and
three
for
you.”

That
made
no
sense
to
Cersei.
Her
thumb
was
throbbing
where
she’d
cut
it,
and
her
blood
was
dripping
on
the
carpet.
How
could
that
be?
she
wanted
to
ask,
but
she
was
done
with
her
questions.

The
old
woman
was
not
done
with
her,
however.
“Gold
shall
be
their
crowns
and
gold
their
shrouds,”
she
said.
“And
when
your
tears
have
drowned
you,
the
valonqar
shall
wrap
his
hands
about
your
pale
white
throat
and
choke
the
life
from
you.”

“What
is
a
valonqar?
Some
monster?”
The
golden
girl
did
not
like
that
foretelling.
“You’re
a
liar
and
a
warty
frog
and
a
smelly
old
savage,
and
I
don’t
believe
a
word
of
what
you
say.
Come
away,
Melara.
She
is
not
worth
hearing.”

“I
get
three
questions
too,”
her
friend
insisted.
And
when
Cersei
tugged
upon
her
arm,
she
wriggled
free
and
turned
back
to
the
crone.
“Will
I
marry
Jaime?”
she
blurted
out.

You
stupid
girl,
the
queen
thought,
angry
even
now.
Jaime
does
not
even
know
you
are
alive.
Back
then
her
brother
lived
only
for
swords
and
dogs
and
horses...
and
for
her,
his
twin.

“Not
Jaime,
nor
any
other
man,”
said
Maggy.
“Worms
will
have
your
maidenhead.
Your
death
is
here
tonight,
little
one.
Can
you
smell
her
breath?
She
is
very
close.”

“The
only
breath
we
smell
is
yours,”
said
Cersei.
There
was
a
jar
of
some
thick
potion
by
her
elbow,
sitting
on
a
table.
She
snatched
it
up
and
threw
it
into
the
old
woman’s
eyes.
In
life
the
crone
had
screamed
at
them
in
some
queer
foreign
tongue,
and
cursed
them
as
they
fled
her
tent.
But
in
the
dream
her
face
dissolved,
melting
away
into
ribbons
of
grey
mist
until
all
that
remained
were
two
squinting
yellow
eyes,
the
eyes
of
death.

The
valonqar
shall
wrap
his
hands
about
your
throat,
the
queen
heard,
but
the
voice
did
not
belong
to
the
old
woman.
The
hands
emerged
from
the
mists
of
her
dream
and
coiled
around
her
neck;
thick
hands,
and
strong.
Above
them
floated
his
face,
leering
down
at
her
with
his
mismatched
eyes.
No,
the
queen
tried
to
cry
out,
but
the
dwarf’s
fingers
dug
deep
into
her
neck,
choking
off
her
protests.
She
kicked
and
screamed
to
no
avail.
Before
long
she
was
making
the
same
sound
her
son
had
made,
the
terrible
thin
sucking
sound
that
marked
Joff’s
last
breath
on
earth.

She
woke
gasping
in
the
dark
with
her
blanket
wound
about
her
neck.
Cersei
wrenched
it
off
so
violently
that
it
tore,
and
sat
up
with
her
breasts
heaving.
A
dream,
she
told
herself,
an
old
dream
and
a
tangled
coverlet,
that’s
all
it
was.

Taena
was
spending
the
night
with
the
little
queen
again,
so
it
was
Dorcas
asleep
beside
her.
The
queen
shook
the
girl
roughly
by
the
shoulder.
“Wake
up,
and
find
Pycelle.
He’ll
be
with
Lord
Gyles,
I
expect.
Fetch
him
here
at
once.”
Still
half
asleep,
Dorcas
stumbled
from
the
bed
and
went
scampering
across
the
chamber
for
her
clothing,
her
bare
feet
rustling
on
the
rushes.

Ages
later,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
entered
shuffling,
and
stood
before
her
with
bowed
head,
blinking
his
heavy-lidded
eyes
and
struggling
not
to
yawn.
He
looked
as
if
the
weight
of
the
huge
maester’s
chain
about
his
wattled
neck
was
dragging
him
down
to
the
floor.
Pycelle
had
been
old
as
far
back
as
Cersei
could
remember,
but
there
was
a
time
when
he
had
also
been
magnificent:
richly
clad,
dignified,
exquisitely
courteous.
His
immense
white
beard
had
given
him
an
air
of
wisdom.
Tyrion
had
shaved
his
beard
off,
though,
and
what
had
grown
back
was
pitiful,
a
few
patchy
tufts
of
thin,
brittle
hair
that
did
little
to
hide
the
loose
pink
flesh
beneath
his
sagging
chin.
This
is
no
man,
she
thought,
only
the
ruins
of
one.
The
black
cells
robbed
him
of
whatever
strength
he
had.
That,
and
the
Imp’s
razor.

“How
old
are
you?”
Cersei
asked,
abruptly.

“Four-and-eighty,
if
it
please
Your
Grace.”

“A
younger
man
would
please
me
more.”

His
tongue
flicked
across
his
lips.
“I
was
but
two-and-forty
when
the
Conclave
called
me.
Kaeth
was
eighty
when
they
chose
him,
and
Ellendor
was
nigh
on
ninety.
The
cares
of
office
crushed
them,
and
both
were
dead
within
a
year
of
being
raised.
Merion
came
next,
only
six-and-sixty,
but
he
died
of
a
chill
on
his
way
to
King’s
Landing.
Afterward
King
Aegon
asked
the
Citadel
to
send
a
younger
man.
He
was
the
first
king
I
served.”

And
Tommen
shall
be
the
last.
“I
need
a
potion
from
you.
Something
to
help
me
sleep.”

“A
cup
of
wine
before
bed
will
oft—”

“I
drink
wine,
you
witless
cretin.
I
require
something
stronger.
Something
that
will
not
let
me
dream.”

“You...
Your
Grace
does
not
wish
to
dream?”

“What
did
I
just
say?
Have
your
ears
grown
as
feeble
as
your
cock?
Can
you
make
me
such
a
potion,
or
must
I
command
Lord
Qyburn
to
rectify
another
of
your
failures?”

“No.
There
is
no
need
to
involve
that...
to
involve
Qyburn.
Dreamless
sleep.
You
shall
have
your
potion.”

“Good.
You
may
go.”
As
he
turned
toward
the
door,
though,
she
called
him
back.
“One
more
thing.
What
does
the
Citadel
teach
concerning
prophecy?
Can
our
morrows
be
foretold?”

The
old
man
hesitated.
One
wrinkled
hand
groped
blindly
at
his
chest,
as
if
to
stroke
the
beard
that
was
not
there.
“Can
our
morrows
be
foretold?”
he
repeated
slowly.
“Mayhaps.
There
are
certain
spells
in
the
old
books...
but
Your
Grace
might
ask
instead,
‘Should
our
morrows
be
foretold?’
And
to
that
I
should
answer,
‘No.’
Some
doors
are
best
left
closed.”

“See
that
you
close
mine
as
you
leave.”
She
should
have
known
that
he
would
give
her
an
answer
as
useless
as
he
was.

The
next
morning
she
broke
her
fast
with
Tommen.
The
boy
seemed
much
subdued;
ministering
to
Pate
had
served
its
purpose,
it
would
seem.
They
ate
fried
eggs,
fried
bread,
bacon,
and
some
blood
oranges
newly
come
by
ship
from
Dorne.
Her
son
was
attended
by
his
kittens.
As
she
watched
the
cats
frolic
about
his
feet,
Cersei
felt
a
little
better.
No
harm
will
ever
come
to
Tommen
whilst
I
still
live.
She
would
kill
half
the
lords
in
Westeros
and
all
the
common
people,
if
that
was
what
it
took
to
keep
him
safe.
“Go
with
Jocelyn,”
she
told
the
boy
after
they
had
eaten.

Then
she
sent
for
Qyburn.
“Is
Lady
Falyse
still
alive?”

“Alive,
yes.
Perhaps
not
entirely...
comfortable.”

“I
see.”
Cersei
considered
a
moment.
“This
man
Bronn...
I
cannot
say
I
like
the
notion
of
an
enemy
so
close.
His
power
all
derives
from
Lollys.
If
we
were
to
produce
her
elder
sister...”

“Alas,”
said
Qyburn.
“I
fear
that
Lady
Falyse
is
no
longer
capable
of
ruling
Stokeworth.
Or,
indeed,
of
feeding
herself.
I
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
her,
I
am
pleased
to
say,
but
the
lessons
have
not
been
entirely
without
cost.
I
hope
I
have
not
exceeded
Your
Grace’s
instructions.”

“No.”
Whatever
she
had
intended,
it
was
too
late.
There
was
no
sense
dwelling
on
such
things.
It
is
better
if
she
dies,
she
told
herself.
She
would
not
want
to
go
on
living
without
her
husband.
Oaf
that
he
was,
the
fool
seemed
fond
of
him.
“There
is
another
matter.
Last
night
I
had
a
dreadful
dream.”

“All
men
are
so
afflicted,
from
time
to
time.”

“This
dream
concerned
a
witch
woman
I
visited
as
a
child.”

“A
woods
witch?
Most
are
harmless
creatures.
They
know
a
little
herb-craft
and
some
midwifery,
but
elsewise...”

“She
was
more
than
that.
Half
of
Lannisport
used
to
go
to
her
for
charms
and
potions.
She
was
mother
to
a
petty
lord,
a
wealthy
merchant
upjumped
by
my
grandsire.
This
lord’s
father
had
found
her
whilst
trading
in
the
east.
Some
say
she
cast
a
spell
on
him,
though
more
like
the
only
charm
she
needed
was
the
one
between
her
thighs.
She
was
not
always
hideous,
or
so
they
said.
I
don’t
recall
the
woman’s
name.
Something
long
and
eastern
and
outlandish.
The
smallfolk
used
to
call
her
Maggy.”

“Maegi?”

“Is
that
how
you
say
it?
The
woman
would
suck
a
drop
of
blood
from
your
finger,
and
tell
you
what
your
morrows
held.”

“Bloodmagic
is
the
darkest
kind
of
sorcery.
Some
say
it
is
the
most
powerful
as
well.”

Cersei
did
not
want
to
hear
that.
“This
maegi
made
certain
prophecies.
I
laughed
at
them
at
first,
but...
she
foretold
the
death
of
one
of
my
bedmaids.
At
the
time
she
made
the
prophecy,
the
girl
was
one-and-ten,
healthy
as
a
little
horse
and
safe
within
the
Rock.
Yet
she
soon
fell
down
a
well
and
drowned.”
Melara
had
begged
her
never
to
speak
of
the
things
they
heard
that
night
in
the
maegi’s
tent.
If
we
never
talk
about
it
we’ll
soon
forget,
and
then
it
will
be
just
a
bad
dream
we
had,
Melara
had
said.
Bad
dreams
never
come
true.
The
both
of
them
had
been
so
young,
that
had
sounded
almost
wise.

“Do
you
still
grieve
for
this
friend
of
your
childhood?”
Qyburn
asked.
“Is
that
what
troubles
you,
Your
Grace?”

“Melara?
No.
I
can
hardly
recall
what
she
looked
like.
It
is
just...
the
maegi
knew
how
many
children
I
would
have,
and
she
knew
of
Robert’s
bastards.
Years
before
he’d
sired
even
the
first
of
them,
she
knew.
She
promised
me
I
should
be
queen,
but
said
another
queen
would
come...”
Younger
and
more
beautiful,
she
said.
“...another
queen,
who
would
take
from
me
all
I
loved.”

“And
you
wish
to
forestall
this
prophecy?”

More
than
anything,
she
thought.
“Can
it
be
forestalled?”

“Oh,
yes.
Never
doubt
that.”

“How?”

“I
think
Your
Grace
knows
how.”

She
did.
I
knew
it
all
along,
she
thought.
Even
in
the
tent.
“If
she
tries
I
will
have
my
brother
kill
her.”

Knowing
what
needed
to
be
done
was
one
thing,
though;
knowing
how
to
do
it
was
another.
Jaime
could
no
longer
be
relied
on.
A
sudden
sickness
would
be
best,
but
the
gods
were
seldom
so
obliging.
How
then?
A
knife,
a
pillow,
a
cup
of
heart’s
bane?
All
of
those
posed
problems.
When
an
old
man
died
in
his
sleep
no
one
thought
twice
of
it,
but
a
girl
of
six-and-ten
found
dead
in
bed
was
certain
to
raise
awkward
questions.
Besides,
Margaery
never
slept
alone.
Even
with
Ser
Loras
dying,
there
were
swords
about
her
night
and
day.

Swords
have
two
edges,
though.
The
very
men
who
guard
her
could
be
used
to
bring
her
down.
The
evidence
would
need
to
be
so
overwhelming
that
even
Margaery’s
own
lord
father
would
have
no
choice
but
to
consent
to
her
execution.
That
would
not
be
easy.
Her
lovers
are
not
like
to
confess,
knowing
it
would
mean
their
heads
as
well
as
hers.
Unless...

The
next
day
the
queen
came
on
Osmund
Kettleblack
in
the
yard,
as
he
was
sparring
with
one
of
the
Redwyne
twins.
Which
one
she
could
not
say;
she
had
never
been
able
to
tell
the
two
of
them
apart.
She
watched
the
swordplay
for
a
while,
then
called
Ser
Osmund
aside.
“Walk
with
me
a
bit,”
she
said,
“and
tell
me
true.
I
want
no
empty
boasting
now,
no
talk
of
how
a
Kettleblack
is
thrice
as
good
as
any
other
knight.
Much
may
ride
upon
your
answer.
Your
brother
Osney.
How
good
a
sword
is
he?”

“Good.
You’ve
seen
him.
He’s
not
as
strong
as
me
nor
Osfryd,
but
he’s
quick
to
the
kill.”

“If
it
came
to
it,
could
he
defeat
Ser
Boros
Blount?”

“Boros
the
Belly?”
Ser
Osmund
chortled.
“He’s
what,
forty?
Fifty?
Half-drunk
half
the
time,
fat
even
when
he’s
sober.
If
he
ever
had
a
taste
for
battle,
he’s
lost
it.
Aye,
Your
Grace,
if
Ser
Boros
wants
for
killing,
Osney
could
do
it
easy
enough.
Why?
Has
Boros
done
some
treason?”

“No,”
she
said.
But
Osney
has.





BRIENNE

They
came
upon
the
first
corpse
a
mile
from
the
crossroads.

He
swung
beneath
the
limb
of
a
dead
tree
whose
blackened
trunk
still
bore
the
scars
of
the
lightning
that
had
killed
it.
The
carrion
crows
had
been
at
work
on
his
face,
and
wolves
had
feasted
on
his
lower
legs
where
they
dangled
near
the
ground.
Only
bones
and
rags
remained
below
his
knees...
along
with
one
well-chewed
shoe,
half-covered
by
mud
and
mold.

“What
does
he
have
in
his
mouth?”
asked
Podrick.

Brienne
had
to
steel
herself
to
look.
His
face
was
grey
and
green
and
ghastly,
his
mouth
open
and
distended.
Someone
had
shoved
a
jagged
white
rock
between
his
teeth.
A
rock,
or...

“Salt,”
said
Septon
Meribald.

Fifty
yards
farther
on
they
spied
the
second
body.
The
scavengers
had
torn
him
down,
so
what
remained
of
him
was
strewn
on
the
ground
beneath
a
frayed
rope
looped
about
the
limb
of
an
elm.
Brienne
might
have
ridden
past
him,
unawares,
if
Dog
had
not
sniffed
him
out
and
loped
into
the
weeds
for
a
closer
smell.

“What
do
you
have
there,
Dog?”
Ser
Hyle
dismounted,
strode
after
the
dog,
and
came
up
with
a
halfhelm.
The
dead
man’s
skull
was
still
inside
it,
along
with
some
worms
and
beetles.
“Good
steel,”
he
pronounced,
“and
not
too
badly
dinted,
though
the
lion’s
lost
his
head.
Pod,
would
you
like
a
helm?”

“Not
that
one.
It’s
got
worms
in
it.”

“Worms
wash
out,
lad.
You’re
squeamish
as
a
girl.”

Brienne
scowled
at
him.
“It
is
too
big
for
him.”

“He’ll
grow
into
it.”

“I
don’t
want
to,”
said
Podrick.
Ser
Hyle
shrugged,
and
tossed
the
broken
helm
back
into
the
weeds,
lion
crest
and
all.
Dog
barked
and
went
to
lift
his
leg
against
the
tree.

After
that,
hardly
a
hundred
yards
went
by
without
a
corpse.
They
dangled
under
ash
and
alder,
beech
and
birch,
larch
and
elm,
hoary
old
willows
and
stately
chestnut
trees.
Each
man
wore
a
noose
around
his
neck,
and
swung
from
a
length
of
hempen
rope,
and
each
man’s
mouth
was
packed
with
salt.
Some
wore
cloaks
of
grey
or
blue
or
crimson,
though
rain
and
sun
had
faded
them
so
badly
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
one
color
from
another.
Others
had
badges
sewn
on
their
breasts.
Brienne
spied
axes,
arrows,
several
salmon,
a
pine
tree,
an
oak
leaf,
beetles,
bantams,
a
boar’s
head,
half
a
dozen
tridents.
Broken
men,
she
realized,
dregs
from
a
dozen
armies,
the
leavings
of
the
lords.

Some
of
the
dead
men
had
been
bald
and
some
bearded,
some
young
and
some
old,
some
short,
some
tall,
some
fat,
some
thin.
Swollen
in
death,
with
faces
gnawed
and
rotten,
they
all
looked
the
same.
On
the
gallows
tree,
all
men
are
brothers.
Brienne
had
read
that
in
a
book,
though
she
could
not
recall
which
one.

It
was
Hyle
Hunt
who
finally
put
words
to
what
all
of
them
had
realized.
“These
are
the
men
who
raided
Saltpans.”

“May
the
Father
judge
them
harshly,”
said
Meribald,
who
had
been
a
friend
to
the
town’s
aged
septon.

Who
they
were
did
not
concern
Brienne
half
so
much
as
who
had
hanged
them.
The
noose
was
the
preferred
method
of
execution
for
Beric
Dondarrion
and
his
band
of
outlaws,
it
was
said.
If
so,
the
so-called
lightning
lord
might
well
be
near.

Dog
barked,
and
Septon
Meribald
glanced
about
and
frowned.
“Shall
we
keep
a
brisker
pace?
The
sun
will
soon
be
setting,
and
corpses
make
poor
company
by
night.
These
were
dark
and
dangerous
men,
alive.
I
doubt
that
death
will
have
improved
them.”

“There
we
disagree,”
said
Ser
Hyle.
“These
are
just
the
sort
of
fellows
who
are
most
improved
by
death.”
All
the
same,
he
put
his
heels
into
his
horse,
and
they
moved
a
little
faster.

Farther
on
the
trees
began
to
thin,
though
not
the
corpses.
The
woods
gave
way
to
muddy
fields,
tree
limbs
to
gibbets.
Clouds
of
crows
rose
screeching
from
the
bodies
as
the
travelers
came
near,
and
settled
again
once
they
had
passed.
These
were
evil
men,
Brienne
reminded
herself,
yet
the
sight
still
made
her
sad.
She
forced
herself
to
look
at
every
man
in
turn,
searching
for
familiar
faces.
A
few
she
thought
she
recognized
from
Harrenhal,
but
their
condition
made
it
hard
to
be
certain.
None
had
a
hound’s
head
helm,
but
few
had
helms
of
any
sort.
Most
had
been
stripped
of
arms,
armor,
and
boots
before
they
were
strung
up.

When
Podrick
asked
the
name
of
the
inn
where
they
hoped
to
spend
the
night,
Septon
Meribald
seized
upon
the
question
eagerly,
perhaps
to
take
their
minds
off
the
grisly
sentinels
along
the
roadside.
“The
Old
Inn,
some
call
it.
There
has
been
an
inn
there
for
many
hundreds
of
years,
though
this
inn
was
only
raised
during
the
reign
of
the
first
Jaehaerys,
the
king
who
built
the
kingsroad.
Jaehaerys
and
his
queen
slept
there
during
their
journeys,
it
is
said.
For
a
time
the
inn
was
known
as
the
Two
Crowns
in
their
honor,
until
one
innkeep
built
a
bell
tower,
and
changed
it
to
the
Bellringer
Inn.
Later
it
passed
to
a
crippled
knight
named
Long
Jon
Heddle,
who
took
up
ironworking
when
he
grew
too
old
to
fight.
He
forged
a
new
sign
for
the
yard,
a
three-headed
dragon
of
black
iron
that
he
hung
from
a
wooden
post.
The
beast
was
so
big
it
had
to
be
made
in
a
dozen
pieces,
joined
with
rope
and
wire.
When
the
wind
blew
it
would
clank
and
clatter,
so
the
inn
became
known
far
and
wide
as
the
Clanking
Dragon.”

“Is
the
dragon
sign
still
there?”
asked
Podrick.

“No,”
said
Septon
Meribald.
“When
the
smith’s
son
was
an
old
man,
a
bastard
son
of
the
fourth
Aegon
rose
up
in
rebellion
against
his
trueborn
brother
and
took
for
his
sigil
a
black
dragon.
These
lands
belonged
to
Lord
Darry
then,
and
his
lordship
was
fiercely
loyal
to
the
king.
The
sight
of
the
black
iron
dragon
made
him
wroth,
so
he
cut
down
the
post,
hacked
the
sign
into
pieces,
and
cast
them
into
the
river.
One
of
the
dragon’s
heads
washed
up
on
the
Quiet
Isle
many
years
later,
though
by
that
time
it
was
red
with
rust.
The
innkeep
never
hung
another
sign,
so
men
forgot
the
dragon
and
took
to
calling
the
place
the
River
Inn.
In
those
days,
the
Trident
flowed
beneath
its
back
door,
and
half
its
rooms
were
built
out
over
the
water.
Guests
could
throw
a
line
out
their
window
and
catch
trout,
it’s
said.
There
was
a
ferry
landing
here
as
well,
so
travelers
could
cross
to
Lord
Harroway’s
Town
and
Whitewalls.”

“We
left
the
Trident
south
of
here,
and
have
been
riding
north
and
west...
not
toward
the
river
but
away
from
it.”

“Aye,
my
lady,”
the
septon
said.
“The
river
moved.
Seventy
years
ago,
it
was.
Or
was
it
eighty?
It
was
when
old
Masha
Heddle’s
grandfather
kept
the
place.
It
was
her
who
told
me
all
this
history.
A
kindly
woman,
Masha,
fond
of
sourleaf
and
honey
cakes.
When
she
did
not
have
a
room
for
me,
she
would
let
me
sleep
beside
the
hearth,
and
she
never
sent
me
on
my
way
without
some
bread
and
cheese
and
a
few
stale
cakes.”

“Is
she
the
innkeep
now?”
asked
Podrick.

“No.
The
lions
hanged
her.
After
they
moved
on,
I
heard
that
one
of
her
nephews
tried
opening
the
inn
again,
but
the
wars
had
made
the
roads
too
dangerous
for
common
folk
to
travel,
so
there
was
little
custom.
He
brought
in
whores,
but
even
that
could
not
save
him.
Some
lord
killed
him
as
well,
I
hear.”

Ser
Hyle
made
a
wry
face.
“I
never
dreamed
that
keeping
an
inn
could
be
so
deadly
dangerous.”

“It
is
being
common-born
that
is
dangerous,
when
the
great
lords
play
their
game
of
thrones,”
said
Septon
Meribald.
“Isn’t
that
so,
Dog?”
Dog
barked
agreement.

“So,”
said
Podrick,
“does
the
inn
have
a
name
now?”

“The
smallfolk
call
it
the
crossroads
inn.
Elder
Brother
told
me
that
two
of
Masha
Heddle’s
nieces
have
opened
it
to
trade
once
again.”
He
raised
his
staff.
“If
the
gods
are
good,
that
smoke
rising
beyond
the
hanged
men
will
be
from
its
chimneys.”

“They
could
call
the
place
the
Gallows
Inn,”
Ser
Hyle
said.

By
any
name
the
inn
was
large,
rising
three
stories
above
the
muddy
roads,
its
walls
and
turrets
and
chimneys
made
of
fine
white
stone
that
glimmered
pale
and
ghostly
against
the
grey
sky.
Its
south
wing
had
been
built
upon
heavy
wooden
pilings
above
a
cracked
and
sunken
expanse
of
weeds
and
dead
brown
grass.
A
thatch-roofed
stable
and
a
bell
tower
were
attached
to
the
north
side.
The
whole
sprawl
was
surrounded
by
a
low
wall
of
broken
white
stones
overgrown
by
moss.

At
least
no
one
has
burned
it
down.
At
Saltpans,
they
had
found
only
death
and
desolation.
By
the
time
Brienne
and
her
companions
were
ferried
over
from
the
Quiet
Isle,
the
survivors
had
fled
and
the
dead
had
been
given
to
the
ground,
but
the
corpse
of
the
town
itself
remained,
ashen
and
unburied.
The
air
still
smelled
of
smoke,
and
the
cries
of
the
seagulls
floating
overhead
sounded
almost
human,
like
the
lamentations
of
lost
children.
Even
the
castle
had
seemed
forlorn
and
abandoned.
Grey
as
the
ashes
of
the
town
around
it,
the
castle
consisted
of
a
square
keep
girded
by
a
curtain
wall,
built
so
as
to
overlook
the
harbor.
It
was
closed
tight
as
Brienne
and
the
others
led
their
horses
off
the
ferry,
nothing
moving
on
its
battlements
but
banners.
It
took
a
quarter
hour
of
Dog
barking
and
Septon
Meribald
knocking
on
the
front
gate
with
his
quarterstaff
before
a
woman
appeared
above
them
to
demand
their
business.

By
that
time
the
ferry
had
departed
and
it
had
begun
to
rain.
“I
am
a
holy
septon,
good
lady,”
Meribald
had
shouted
up,
“and
these
are
honest
travelers.
We
seek
shelter
from
the
rain,
and
a
place
by
your
fire
for
the
night.”
The
woman
had
been
unmoved
by
his
appeals.
“The
closest
inn
is
at
the
crossroads,
to
the
west,”
she
replied.
“We
want
no
strangers
here.
Begone.”
Once
she
vanished,
neither
Meribald’s
prayers,
Dog’s
barks,
nor
Ser
Hyle’s
curses
could
bring
her
back.
In
the
end
they
had
spent
the
night
in
the
woods,
beneath
a
shelter
made
of
woven
branches.

There
was
life
at
the
crossroads
inn,
though.
Even
before
they
reached
the
gate,
Brienne
heard
the
sound:
a
hammering,
faint
but
steady.
It
had
a
steely
ring.

“A
forge,”
Ser
Hyle
said.
“Either
they
have
themselves
a
smith,
or
the
old
innkeep’s
ghost
is
making
another
iron
dragon.”
He
put
his
heels
into
his
horse.
“I
hope
they
have
a
ghostly
cook
as
well.
A
crisp
roast
chicken
would
set
the
world
aright.”

The
inn’s
yard
was
a
sea
of
brown
mud
that
sucked
at
the
hooves
of
the
horses.
The
clang
of
steel
was
louder
here,
and
Brienne
saw
the
red
glow
of
the
forge
down
past
the
far
end
of
the
stables,
behind
an
oxcart
with
a
broken
wheel.
She
could
see
horses
in
the
stables
too,
and
a
small
boy
was
swinging
from
the
rusted
chains
of
the
weathered
gibbet
that
loomed
above
the
yard.
Four
girls
stood
on
the
inn’s
porch,
watching
him.
The
youngest
was
no
more
than
two,
and
naked.
The
oldest,
nine
or
ten,
stood
with
her
arms
protectively
about
the
little
one.
“Girls,”
Ser
Hyle
called
to
them,
“run
and
fetch
your
mother.”

The
boy
dropped
from
the
chain
and
dashed
off
toward
the
stables.
The
four
girls
stood
fidgeting.
After
a
moment
one
said,
“We
have
no
mothers,”
and
another
added,
“I
had
one
but
they
killed
her.”
The
oldest
of
the
four
stepped
forward,
pushing
the
little
one
behind
her
skirts.
“Who
are
you?”
she
demanded.

“Honest
travelers
seeking
shelter.
My
name
is
Brienne,
and
this
is
Septon
Meribald,
who
is
well-known
through
the
riverlands.
The
boy
is
my
squire,
Podrick
Payne,
the
knight
Ser
Hyle
Hunt.”

The
hammering
stopped
suddenly.
The
girl
on
the
porch
looked
them
over,
wary
as
only
a
ten-year-old
can
be.
“I’m
Willow.
Will
you
be
wanting
beds?”

“Beds,
and
ale,
and
hot
food
to
fill
our
bellies,”
said
Ser
Hyle
Hunt
as
he
dismounted.
“Are
you
the
innkeep?”

She
shook
her
head.
“That’s
my
sister
Jeyne.
She’s
not
here.
All
we
have
to
eat
is
horse
meat.
If
you
come
for
whores,
there
are
none.
My
sister
run
them
off.
We
have
beds,
though.
Some
featherbeds,
but
more
are
straw.”

“And
all
have
fleas,
I
don’t
doubt,”
said
Ser
Hyle.

“Do
you
have
coin
to
pay?
Silver?”

Ser
Hyle
laughed.
“Silver?
For
a
night’s
bed
and
a
haunch
of
horse?
Do
you
mean
to
rob
us,
child?”

“We’ll
have
silver.
Else
you
can
sleep
in
the
woods
with
the
dead
men.”
Willow
glanced
toward
the
donkey,
and
the
casks
and
bundles
on
his
back.
“Is
that
food?
Where
did
you
get
it?”

“Maidenpool,”
said
Meribald.
Dog
barked.

“Do
you
question
all
your
guests
this
way?”
asked
Ser
Hyle.

“We
don’t
have
so
many
guests.
Not
like
before
the
war.
It’s
mostly
sparrows
on
the
roads
these
days,
or
worse.”

“Worse?”
Brienne
asked.

“Thieves,”
said
a
boy’s
voice
from
the
stables.
“Robbers.”

Brienne
turned,
and
saw
a
ghost.

Renly.
No
hammerblow
to
the
heart
could
have
felled
her
half
so
hard.
“My
lord?”
she
gasped.

“Lord?”
The
boy
pushed
back
a
lock
of
black
hair
that
had
fallen
across
his
eyes.
“I’m
just
a
smith.”

He
is
not
Renly,
Brienne
realized.
Renly
is
dead.
Renly
died
in
my
arms,
a
man
of
one-and-twenty.
This
is
a
only
a
boy.
A
boy
who
looked
as
Renly
had,
the
first
time
he
came
to
Tarth.
No,
younger.
His
jaw
is
squarer,
his
brows
bushier.
Renly
had
been
lean
and
lithe,
whereas
this
boy
had
the
heavy
shoulders
and
muscular
right
arm
so
often
seen
on
smiths.
He
wore
a
long
leather
apron,
but
under
it
his
chest
was
bare.
A
dark
stubble
covered
his
cheeks
and
chin,
and
his
hair
was
a
thick
black
mop
that
grew
down
past
his
ears.
King
Renly’s
hair
had
been
that
same
coal
black,
but
his
had
always
been
washed
and
brushed
and
combed.
Sometimes
he
cut
it
short,
and
sometimes
he
let
it
fall
loose
to
his
shoulders,
or
tied
it
back
behind
his
head
with
a
golden
ribbon,
but
it
was
never
tangled
or
matted
with
sweat.
And
though
his
eyes
had
been
that
same
deep
blue,
Lord
Renly’s
eyes
had
always
been
warm
and
welcoming,
full
of
laughter,
whereas
this
boy’s
eyes
brimmed
with
anger
and
suspicion.

Septon
Meribald
saw
it
too.
“We
mean
no
harm,
lad.
When
Masha
Heddle
owned
this
inn
she
always
had
a
honey
cake
for
me.
Sometimes
she
even
let
me
have
a
bed,
if
the
inn
was
not
full.”

“She’s
dead,”
the
boy
said.
“The
lions
hanged
her.”

“Hanging
seems
your
favorite
sport
in
these
parts,”
said
Ser
Hyle
Hunt.
“Would
that
I
had
some
land
hereabouts.
I’d
plant
hemp,
sell
rope,
and
make
my
fortune.”

“All
these
children,”
Brienne
said
to
the
girl
Willow.
“Are
they
your...
sisters?
Brothers?
Kin
and
cousins?”

“No.”
Willow
was
staring
at
her,
in
a
way
that
she
knew
well.
“They’re
just...
I
don’t
know...
the
sparrows
bring
them
here,
sometimes.
Others
find
their
own
way.
If
you’re
a
woman,
why
are
you
dressed
up
like
a
man?”

Septon
Meribald
answered.
“Lady
Brienne
is
a
warrior
maid
upon
a
quest.
Just
now,
though,
she
is
in
need
of
a
dry
bed
and
a
warm
fire.
As
are
we
all.
My
old
bones
say
it’s
going
to
rain
again,
and
soon.
Do
you
have
rooms
for
us?”

“No,”
said
the
boy
smith.
“Yes,”
said
the
girl
Willow.

They
glared
at
one
another.
Then
Willow
stomped
her
foot.
“They
have
food,
Gendry.
The
little
ones
are
hungry.”
She
whistled,
and
more
children
appeared
as
if
by
magic;
ragged
boys
with
unshorn
locks
crept
from
under
the
porch,
and
furtive
girls
appeared
in
the
windows
overlooking
the
yard.
Some
clutched
crossbows,
wound
and
loaded.

“They
could
call
it
Crossbow
Inn,”
Ser
Hyle
suggested.

Orphan
Inn
would
be
more
apt,
thought
Brienne.

“Wat,
you
help
them
with
those
horses,”
said
Willow.
“Will,
put
down
that
rock,
they’ve
not
come
to
hurt
us.
Tansy,
Pate,
run
get
some
wood
to
feed
the
fire.
Jon
Penny,
you
help
the
septon
with
those
bundles.
I’ll
show
them
to
some
rooms.”

In
the
end
they
took
three
rooms
adjoining
one
another,
each
boasting
a
featherbed,
a
chamber
pot,
and
a
window.
Brienne’s
room
had
a
hearth
as
well.
She
paid
a
few
pennies
more
for
some
wood.
“Will
I
sleep
in
your
room,
or
Ser
Hyle’s?”
Podrick
asked
as
she
was
opening
the
shutters.
“This
is
not
the
Quiet
Isle,”
she
told
him.
“You
can
stay
with
me.”
Come
the
morrow
she
meant
for
the
two
of
them
to
strike
out
on
their
own.
Septon
Meribald
was
going
on
to
Nutten,
Riverbend,
and
Lord
Harroway’s
Town,
but
Brienne
saw
no
sense
in
following
him
any
farther.
He
had
Dog
to
keep
him
company,
and
the
Elder
Brother
had
persuaded
her
that
she
would
not
find
Sansa
Stark
along
the
Trident.
“I
mean
to
rise
before
the
sun
comes
up,
whilst
Ser
Hyle
is
still
sleeping.”
Brienne
had
not
forgiven
him
for
Highgarden...
and
as
he
himself
had
said,
Hunt
had
sworn
no
vows
concerning
Sansa.

“Where
will
we
go,
ser?
I
mean,
my
lady?”

Brienne
had
no
ready
answer
for
him.
They
had
come
to
the
crossroads,
quite
literally;
the
place
where
the
kingsroad,
the
river
road,
and
the
high
road
all
came
together.
The
high
road
would
take
them
east
through
the
mountains
to
the
Vale
of
Arryn,
where
Lady
Sansa’s
aunt
had
ruled
until
her
death.
West
ran
the
river
road,
which
followed
the
course
of
the
Red
Fork
to
Riverrun
and
Sansa’s
great-uncle,
who
was
besieged
but
still
alive.
Or
they
could
ride
the
kingsroad
north,
past
the
Twins
and
through
the
Neck
with
its
bogs
and
marshes.
If
she
could
find
a
way
past
Moat
Cailin
and
whoever
held
it
now,
the
kingsroad
would
bring
them
all
the
way
to
Winterfell.

Or
I
could
take
the
kingsroad
south,
Brienne
thought.
I
could
slink
back
to
King’s
Landing,
confess
my
failure
to
Ser
Jaime,
give
him
back
his
sword,
and
find
a
ship
to
carry
me
home
to
Tarth,
as
the
Elder
Brother
urged.
The
thought
was
a
bitter
one,
yet
there
was
part
of
her
that
yearned
for
Evenfall
and
her
father,
and
another
part
that
wondered
if
Jaime
would
comfort
her
should
she
weep
upon
his
shoulder.
That
was
what
men
wanted,
wasn’t
it?
Soft
helpless
women
that
they
needed
to
protect?

“Ser?
My
lady?
I
asked,
where
are
we
going?”

“Down
to
the
common
room,
to
supper.”

The
common
room
was
crawling
with
children.
Brienne
tried
to
count
them,
but
they
would
not
stand
still
even
for
an
instant,
so
she
counted
some
of
them
twice
or
thrice
and
others
not
at
all,
until
she
finally
gave
it
up.
They
had
pushed
the
tables
together
in
three
long
rows,
and
the
older
boys
were
wrestling
benches
from
the
back.
Older
here
meant
ten
or
twelve.
Gendry
was
the
closest
thing
to
a
man
grown,
but
it
was
Willow
shouting
all
the
orders,
as
if
she
were
a
queen
in
her
castle
and
the
other
children
were
no
more
than
servants.

If
she
were
highborn,
command
would
come
naturally
to
her,
and
deference
to
them.
Brienne
wondered
whether
Willow
might
be
more
than
she
appeared.
The
girl
was
too
young
and
too
plain
to
be
Sansa
Stark,
but
she
was
of
the
right
age
to
be
the
younger
sister,
and
even
Lady
Catelyn
had
said
that
Arya
lacked
her
sister’s
beauty.
Brown
hair,
brown
eyes,
skinny...
could
it
be?
Arya
Stark’s
hair
was
brown,
she
recalled,
but
Brienne
was
not
sure
of
the
color
of
her
eyes.
Brown
and
brown,
was
that
it?
Could
it
be
that
she
did
not
die
at
Saltpans
after
all?

Outside,
the
last
light
of
day
was
fading.
Inside,
Willow
had
four
greasy
tallow
candles
lit
and
told
the
girls
to
keep
the
hearthfire
burning
high
and
hot.
The
boys
helped
Podrick
Payne
unpack
the
donkey
and
carried
in
the
salt
cod,
mutton,
vegetables,
nuts,
and
wheels
of
cheese,
whilst
Septon
Meribald
repaired
to
the
kitchens
to
take
charge
of
the
porridge.
“Alas,
my
oranges
are
gone,
and
I
doubt
that
I
shall
see
another
till
the
spring,”
he
told
one
small
boy.
“Have
you
ever
had
an
orange,
lad?
Squeezed
one
and
sucked
down
that
fine
juice?”
When
the
boy
shook
his
head
no,
the
septon
mussed
his
hair.
“Then
I’ll
bring
you
one,
come
spring,
if
you
will
be
a
good
lad
and
help
me
stir
the
porridge.”

Ser
Hyle
pulled
off
his
boots
to
warm
his
feet
by
the
fire.
When
Brienne
sat
down
next
to
him,
he
nodded
at
the
far
end
of
the
room.
“There
are
bloodstains
on
the
floor
over
there
where
Dog
is
sniffing.
They’ve
been
scrubbed,
but
the
blood
soaked
deep
into
the
wood,
and
there’s
no
getting
it
out.”

“This
is
the
inn
where
Sandor
Clegane
killed
three
of
his
brother’s
men,”
she
reminded
him.

“’Tis
that,”
Hunt
agreed,
“but
who
is
to
say
that
they
were
the
first
to
die
here...
or
that
they’ll
be
the
last.”

“Are
you
afraid
of
a
few
children?”

“Four
would
be
a
few.
Ten
would
be
a
surfeit.
This
is
a
cacophony.
Children
should
be
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
and
hung
upon
the
wall
until
the
girls
grow
breasts
and
the
boys
are
old
enough
to
shave.”

“I
feel
sorry
for
them.
All
of
them
have
lost
their
mothers
and
fathers.
Some
have
seen
them
slain.”

Hunt
rolled
his
eyes.
“I
forgot
that
I
was
talking
to
a
woman.
Your
heart
is
as
mushy
as
our
septon’s
porridge.
Can
it
be?
Somewhere
inside
our
swordswench
is
a
mother
just
squirming
to
give
birth.
What
you
really
want
is
a
sweet
pink
babe
to
suckle
at
your
teat.”
Ser
Hyle
grinned.
“You
need
a
man
for
that,
I
hear.
A
husband,
preferably.
Why
not
me?”

“If
you
still
hope
to
win
your
wager—”

“What
I
want
to
win
is
you,
Lord
Selwyn’s
only
living
child.
I’ve
known
men
to
wed
lackwits
and
suckling
babes
for
prizes
a
tenth
the
size
of
Tarth.
I
am
not
Renly
Baratheon,
I
confess
it,
but
I
have
the
virtue
of
being
still
amongst
the
living.
Some
would
say
that
is
my
only
virtue.
Marriage
would
serve
the
both
of
us.
Lands
for
me,
and
a
castle
full
of
these
for
you.”
He
waved
his
hand
at
the
children.
“I
am
capable,
I
assure
you.
I’ve
sired
at
least
one
bastard
that
I
know
of.
Have
no
fear,
I
shan’t
inflict
her
upon
you.
The
last
time
I
went
to
see
her,
her
mother
doused
me
with
a
kettle
of
soup.”

A
flush
crept
up
her
neck.
“My
father’s
only
four-and-fifty.
Not
too
old
to
wed
again
and
get
a
son
by
his
new
wife.”

“That’s
a
risk...
if
your
father
weds
again
and
if
his
bride
proves
fertile
and
if
the
babe’s
a
boy.
I’ve
made
worse
wagers.”

“And
lost
them.
Play
your
game
with
someone
else,
ser.”

“So
speaks
a
maid
who
has
never
played
the
game
with
anyone.
Once
you
do
you’ll
take
a
different
view.
In
the
dark
you’d
be
as
beautiful
as
any
other
woman.
Your
lips
were
made
for
kissing.”

“They
are
lips,”
said
Brienne.
“All
lips
are
the
same.”

“And
all
lips
are
made
for
kissing,”
Hunt
agreed
pleasantly.
“Leave
your
chamber
door
unbarred
tonight,
and
I
will
steal
into
your
bed
and
prove
the
truth
of
what
I
say.”

“If
you
do,
you’ll
be
a
eunuch
when
you
leave.”
Brienne
got
up
and
walked
away
from
him.

Septon
Meribald
asked
if
he
might
lead
the
children
in
a
grace,
ignoring
the
small
girl
crawling
naked
across
the
table.
“Aye,”
said
Willow,
snatching
up
the
crawler
before
she
reached
the
porridge.
So
they
bowed
their
heads
together
and
thanked
the
Father
and
the
Mother
for
their
bounty...
all
but
the
black-haired
boy
from
the
forge,
who
crossed
his
arms
against
his
chest
and
sat
glowering
as
the
others
prayed.
Brienne
was
not
the
only
one
to
notice.
When
the
prayer
was
done
Septon
Meribald
looked
across
the
table,
and
said,
“Do
you
have
no
love
for
the
gods,
son?”

“Not
for
your
gods.”
Gendry
stood
abruptly.
“I
have
work
to
do.”
He
stalked
out
without
a
bite
of
food.

“Is
there
some
other
god
he
loves?”
asked
Hyle
Hunt.

“The
Lord
of
Light,”
piped
one
scrawny
boy,
nigh
to
six.

Willow
hit
him
with
her
spoon.
“Ben
Big
Mouth.
There’s
food.
You
should
be
eating
it,
not
bothering
m’lords
with
talk.”

The
children
fell
upon
the
supper
like
wolves
upon
a
wounded
deer,
quarreling
over
codfish,
tearing
the
barley
bread
to
pieces,
and
getting
porridge
everywhere.
Even
the
huge
wheel
of
cheese
did
not
long
survive.
Brienne
contented
herself
with
fish
and
bread
and
carrots,
whilst
Septon
Meribald
fed
two
morsels
to
Dog
for
every
one
he
ate
himself.
Outside,
a
rain
began
to
fall.
Inside,
the
fire
crackled,
and
the
common
room
was
filled
by
the
sounds
of
chewing,
and
Willow
smacking
children
with
her
spoon.
“One
day
that
little
girl
will
make
some
man
a
frightful
wife,”
Ser
Hyle
observed.
“That
poor
’prentice
boy,
most
like.”

“Someone
should
take
him
some
food
before
it’s
all
gone.”

“You’re
someone.”

She
wrapped
a
wedge
of
cheese,
a
heel
of
bread,
a
dried
apple,
and
two
chunks
of
flaky
fried
cod
in
a
square
of
cloth.
When
Podrick
got
up
to
follow
her
outside,
she
told
him
to
sit
back
down
and
eat.
“I
will
not
be
long.”

The
rain
was
coming
down
heavy
in
the
yard.
Brienne
covered
the
food
with
a
fold
of
her
cloak.
Some
of
the
horses
whinnied
at
her
as
she
made
her
way
past
the
stables.
They
are
hungry
too.

Gendry
was
at
his
forge,
bare-chested
beneath
his
leather
apron.
He
was
beating
on
a
sword
as
if
he
wished
it
were
a
foe,
his
sweat-soaked
hair
falling
across
his
brow.
She
watched
him
for
a
moment.
He
has
Renly’s
eyes
and
Renly’s
hair,
but
not
his
build.
Lord
Renly
was
more
lithe
than
brawny...
not
like
his
brother
Robert,
whose
strength
was
fabled.

It
was
not
until
he
stopped
to
wipe
his
brow
that
Gendry
saw
her
standing
there.
“What
do
you
want?”

“I
brought
supper.”
She
opened
the
cloth
for
him
to
see.

“If
I
wanted
food,
I
would
have
eaten
some.”

“A
smith
needs
to
eat
to
keep
his
strength
up.”

“Are
you
my
mother?”

“No.”
She
put
down
the
food.
“Who
was
your
mother?”

“What’s
that
to
you?”

“You
were
born
in
King’s
Landing.”
The
way
he
spoke
made
her
certain
of
it.

“Me
and
many
more.”
He
plunged
the
sword
into
a
tub
of
rainwater
to
quench
it.
The
hot
steel
hissed
angrily.

“How
old
are
you?”
Brienne
asked.
“Is
your
mother
still
alive?
And
your
father,
who
was
he?”

“You
ask
too
many
questions.”
He
set
down
the
sword.
“My
mother’s
dead
and
I
never
knew
my
father.”

“You’re
a
bastard.”

He
took
it
for
an
insult.
“I’m
a
knight.
That
sword
will
be
mine
own,
once
it’s
done.”

What
would
a
knight
be
doing
working
at
a
smithy?
“You
have
black
hair
and
blue
eyes,
and
you
were
born
in
the
shadow
of
the
Red
Keep.
Has
no
one
ever
remarked
upon
your
face?”

“What’s
wrong
with
my
face?
It’s
not
as
ugly
as
yours.”

“In
King’s
Landing
you
must
have
seen
King
Robert.”

He
shrugged.
“Sometimes.
At
tourneys,
from
afar.
Once
at
Baelor’s
Sept.
The
gold
cloaks
shoved
us
aside
so
he
could
pass.
Another
time
I
was
playing
near
the
Mud
Gate
when
he
come
back
from
a
hunt.
He
was
so
drunk
he
almost
rode
me
down.
A
big
fat
sot,
he
was,
but
a
better
king
than
these
sons
of
his.”

They
are
not
his
sons.
Stannis
told
it
true,
that
day
he
met
with
Renly.
Joffrey
and
Tommen
were
never
Robert’s
sons.
This
boy,
though...
“Listen
to
me,”
Brienne
began.
Then
she
heard
Dog
barking,
loud
and
frantic.
“Someone
is
coming.”

“Friends,”
said
Gendry,
unconcerned.

“What
sort
of
friends?”
Brienne
moved
to
the
door
of
the
smithy
to
peer
out
through
the
rain.

He
shrugged.
“You’ll
meet
them
soon
enough.”

I
may
not
want
to
meet
them,
Brienne
thought,
as
the
first
riders
came
splashing
through
the
puddles
into
the
yard.
Beneath
the
patter
of
the
rain
and
Dog’s
barking,
she
could
hear
the
faint
clink
of
swords
and
mail
from
beneath
their
ragged
cloaks.
She
counted
them
as
they
came.
Two,
four,
six,
seven.
Some
of
them
were
wounded,
judging
from
the
way
they
rode.
The
last
man
was
massive
and
hulking,
as
big
as
two
of
the
others.
His
horse
was
blown
and
bloody,
staggering
beneath
his
weight.
All
the
riders
had
their
hoods
up
against
the
lashing
rain,
save
him
alone.
His
face
was
broad
and
hairless,
maggot
white,
his
round
cheeks
covered
with
weeping
sores.

Brienne
sucked
in
her
breath
and
drew
Oathkeeper.
Too
many,
she
thought,
with
a
start
of
fear,
they
are
too
many.
“Gendry,”
she
said
in
a
low
voice,
“you’ll
want
a
sword,
and
armor.
These
are
not
your
friends.
They’re
no
one’s
friends.”

“What
are
you
talking
about?”
The
boy
came
and
stood
beside
her,
his
hammer
in
his
hand.

Lightning
cracked
to
the
south
as
the
riders
swung
down
off
their
horses.
For
half
a
heartbeat
darkness
turned
to
day.
An
axe
gleamed
silvery
blue,
light
shimmered
off
mail
and
plate,
and
beneath
the
dark
hood
of
the
lead
rider
Brienne
glimpsed
an
iron
snout
and
rows
of
steel
teeth,
snarling.

Gendry
saw
it
too.
“Him.”

“Not
him.
His
helm.”
Brienne
tried
to
keep
the
fear
from
her
voice,
but
her
mouth
was
dry
as
dust.
She
had
a
pretty
good
notion
who
wore
the
Hound’s
helm.
The
children,
she
thought.

The
door
to
the
inn
banged
open.
Willow
stepped
out
into
the
rain,
a
crossbow
in
her
hands.
The
girl
was
shouting
at
the
riders,
but
a
clap
of
thunder
rolled
across
the
yard,
drowning
out
her
words.
As
it
faded,
Brienne
heard
the
man
in
the
Hound’s
helm
say,
“Loose
a
quarrel
at
me
and
I’ll
shove
that
crossbow
up
your
cunt
and
fuck
you
with
it.
Then
I’ll
pop
your
fucking
eyes
out
and
make
you
eat
them.”
The
fury
in
the
man’s
voice
drove
Willow
back
a
step,
trembling.

Seven,
Brienne
thought
again,
despairing.
She
had
no
chance
against
seven,
she
knew.
No
chance,
and
no
choice.

She
stepped
out
into
the
rain,
Oathkeeper
in
hand.
“Leave
her
be.
If
you
want
to
rape
someone,
try
me.”

The
oulaws
turned
as
one.
One
laughed,
and
another
said
something
in
a
tongue
Brienne
did
not
know.
The
huge
one
with
the
broad
white
face
gave
a
malevolent
hissssssssssssssss.
The
man
in
the
Hound’s
helm
began
to
laugh.
“You’re
even
uglier
than
I
remembered.
I’d
sooner
rape
your
horse.”

“Horses,
that’s
what
we
want,”
one
of
the
wounded
men
said.
“Fresh
horses,
and
some
food.
There
are
outlaws
after
us.
Give
us
your
horses
and
we’ll
be
gone.
We
won’t
do
you
harm.”

“Fuck
that.”
The
outlaw
in
the
Hound’s
helm
yanked
a
battle
axe
off
his
saddle.
“I
want
to
cut
her
bloody
legs
off.
I’ll
set
her
on
her
stumps
so
she
can
watch
me
fuck
the
crossbow
girl.”

“With
what?”
taunted
Brienne.
“Shagwell
said
they
cut
your
manhood
off
when
they
took
your
nose.”

She
meant
it
to
provoke
him,
and
it
did.
Bellowing
curses,
he
came
at
her,
his
feet
sending
up
splashes
of
black
water
as
he
charged.
The
others
stood
back
to
watch
the
show,
as
she
had
prayed
they
might.
Brienne
stayed
as
still
as
stone,
waiting.
The
yard
was
dark,
the
mud
slippery
underfoot.
Better
to
let
him
come
to
me.
If
the
gods
are
good,
he’ll
slip
and
fall.

The
gods
were
not
that
good,
but
her
sword
was.
Five
steps,
four
steps,
now,
Brienne
counted,
and
Oathkeeper
swept
up
to
meet
his
rush.
Steel
crashed
against
steel
as
her
blade
bit
through
his
rags
and
opened
a
gash
in
his
chainmail,
even
as
his
axe
came
crashing
down
at
her.
She
twisted
aside,
slashing
at
his
chest
again
as
she
retreated.

He
followed,
staggering
and
bleeding,
roaring
rage.
“Whore!”
he
boomed.
“Freak!
Bitch!
I’ll
give
you
to
my
dog
to
fuck,
you
bloody
bitch!”
His
axe
whirled
in
murderous
arcs,
a
brutal
black
shadow
that
turned
silver
every
time
the
lightning
flashed.
Brienne
had
no
shield
to
catch
the
blows.
All
she
could
do
was
slide
back
away
from
him,
darting
this
way
and
that
as
the
axehead
flew
at
her.
Once
the
mud
gave
way
under
her
heel
and
she
almost
fell,
but
somehow
she
recovered
herself,
though
the
axe
grazed
her
left
shoulder
that
time
and
left
a
blaze
of
pain
in
its
wake.
“You
got
the
bitch!”
one
of
the
others
called,
and
another
said,
“Let’s
see
her
dance
away
from
that
one.”

Dance
she
did,
relieved
that
they
were
watching.
Better
that
than
have
them
interfere.
She
could
not
fight
seven,
not
alone,
even
if
one
or
two
were
wounded.
Old
Ser
Goodwin
was
long
in
his
grave,
yet
she
could
hear
him
whispering
in
her
ear.
Men
will
always
underestimate
you,
he
said,
and
their
pride
will
make
them
want
to
vanquish
you
quickly,
lest
it
be
said
that
a
woman
tried
them
sorely.
Let
them
spend
their
strength
in
furious
attacks,
whilst
you
conserve
your
own.
Wait
and
watch,
girl,
wait
and
watch.
She
waited,
watching,
moving
sideways,
then
backwards,
then
sideways
again,
slashing
now
at
his
face,
now
at
his
legs,
now
at
his
arm.
His
blows
came
more
slowly
as
his
axe
grew
heavier.
Brienne
turned
him
so
the
rain
was
in
his
eyes,
and
stepped
back
two
quick
steps.
He
wrenched
his
axe
up
once
more,
cursing,
and
lurched
after
her,
one
foot
sliding
in
the
mud...

...and
she
leapt
to
meet
his
rush,
both
hands
on
her
sword
hilt.
His
headlong
charge
brought
him
right
onto
her
point,
and
Oathkeeper
punched
through
cloth
and
mail
and
leather
and
more
cloth,
deep
into
his
bowels
and
out
his
back,
rasping
as
it
scraped
along
his
spine.
His
axe
fell
from
limp
fingers,
and
the
two
of
them
slammed
together,
Brienne’s
face
mashed
up
against
the
dog’s
head
helm.
She
felt
the
cold
wet
metal
against
her
cheek.
Rain
ran
down
the
steel
in
rivers,
and
when
the
lightning
flashed
again
she
saw
pain
and
fear
and
rank
disbelief
through
the
eye
slits.
“Sapphires,”
she
whispered
at
him,
as
she
gave
her
blade
a
hard
twist
that
made
him
shudder.
His
weight
sagged
heavily
against
her,
and
all
at
once
it
was
a
corpse
that
she
embraced,
there
in
the
black
rain.
She
stepped
back
and
let
him
fall...

...and
Biter
crashed
into
her,
shrieking.

He
fell
on
her
like
an
avalanche
of
wet
wool
and
milk-white
flesh,
lifting
her
off
her
feet
and
slamming
her
down
into
the
ground.
She
landed
in
a
puddle
with
a
splash
that
sent
water
up
her
nose
and
into
her
eyes.
All
the
air
was
driven
out
of
her,
and
her
head
snapped
down
against
some
half-buried
stone
with
a
crack.
“No,”
was
all
that
she
had
time
to
say
before
he
fell
on
top
of
her,
his
weight
driving
her
deeper
into
the
mud.
One
of
his
hands
was
in
her
hair,
pulling
her
head
back.
The
other
groped
for
her
throat.
Oathkeeper
was
gone,
torn
from
her
grasp.
She
had
only
her
hands
to
fight
him
off,
but
when
she
slammed
a
fist
into
his
face
it
was
like
punching
a
ball
of
wet
white
dough.
He
hissed
at
her.

She
hit
him
again,
again,
again,
smashing
the
heel
of
her
hand
into
his
eye,
but
he
did
not
seem
to
feel
her
blows.
She
clawed
at
his
wrists,
but
his
grip
just
grew
tighter,
though
blood
ran
from
the
gouges
where
she
scratched
him.
He
was
crushing
her,
smothering
her.
She
pushed
at
his
shoulders
to
get
him
off
her,
but
he
was
heavy
as
a
horse,
impossible
to
move.
When
she
tried
to
knee
him
in
the
groin,
all
she
did
was
drive
her
knee
into
his
belly.
Grunting,
Biter
tore
out
a
handful
of
her
hair.

My
dagger.
Brienne
clutched
at
the
thought,
desperate.
She
worked
her
hand
down
between
them,
fingers
squirming
under
his
sour,
suffocating
flesh,
searching
until
they
finally
found
the
hilt.
Biter
locked
both
his
hands
about
her
neck
and
began
to
slam
her
head
against
the
ground.
The
lightning
flashed
again,
this
time
inside
her
skull,
yet
somehow
her
fingers
tightened,
pulled
the
dagger
from
its
sheath.
With
him
on
top
of
her,
she
could
not
raise
the
blade
to
stab,
so
she
drew
it
hard
across
his
belly.
Something
warm
and
wet
gushed
between
her
fingers.
Biter
hissed
again,
louder
than
before,
and
let
go
of
her
throat
just
long
enough
to
smash
her
in
the
face.
She
heard
bones
crack,
and
the
pain
blinded
her
for
an
instant.
When
she
tried
to
slash
at
him
again,
he
wrenched
the
dagger
from
her
fingers
and
slammed
a
knee
down
onto
her
forearm,
breaking
it.
Then
he
seized
her
head
again
and
resumed
trying
to
tear
it
off
her
shoulders.

Brienne
could
hear
Dog
barking,
and
men
were
shouting
all
about
her,
and
between
the
claps
of
thunder
she
heard
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel.
Ser
Hyle,
she
thought,
Ser
Hyle
has
joined
the
fight,
but
all
that
seemed
far
away
and
unimportant.
Her
world
was
no
larger
than
the
hands
at
her
throat
and
the
face
that
loomed
above
her.
The
rain
ran
off
his
hood
as
he
leaned
closer.
His
breath
stank
like
cheese
gone
rotten.

Brienne’s
chest
was
burning,
and
the
storm
was
behind
her
eyes,
blinding
her.
Bones
ground
against
each
other
inside
of
her.
Biter’s
mouth
gaped
open,
impossibly
wide.
She
saw
his
teeth,
yellow
and
crooked,
filed
into
points.
When
they
closed
on
the
soft
meat
of
her
cheek,
she
hardly
felt
it.
She
could
feel
herself
spiraling
down
into
the
dark.
I
cannot
die
yet,
she
told
herself,
there
is
something
I
still
need
to
do.

Biter’s
mouth
tore
free,
full
of
blood
and
flesh.
He
spat,
grinned,
and
sank
his
pointed
teeth
into
her
flesh
again.
This
time
he
chewed
and
swallowed.
He
is
eating
me,
she
realized,
but
she
had
no
strength
left
to
fight
him
any
longer.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
floating
above
herself,
watching
the
horror
as
if
it
were
happening
to
some
other
woman,
to
some
stupid
girl
who
thought
she
was
a
knight.
It
will
be
finished
soon,
she
told
herself.
Then
it
will
not
matter
if
he
eats
me.
Biter
threw
back
his
head
and
opened
his
mouth
again,
howling,
and
stuck
his
tongue
out
at
her.
It
was
sharply
pointed,
dripping
blood,
longer
than
any
tongue
should
be.
Sliding
from
his
mouth,
out
and
out
and
out,
red
and
wet
and
glistening,
it
made
a
hideous
sight,
obscene.
His
tongue
is
a
foot
long,
Brienne
thought,
just
before
the
darkness
took
her.
Why,
it
looks
almost
like
a
sword.





JAIME

The
brooch
that
fastened
Ser
Brynden
Tully’s
cloak
was
a
black
fish,
wrought
in
jet
and
gold.
His
ringmail
was
grim
and
grey.
Over
it
he
wore
greaves,
gorget,
gauntlets,
pauldron,
and
poleyns
of
blackened
steel,
none
half
so
dark
as
the
look
upon
his
face
as
he
waited
for
Jaime
Lannister
at
the
end
of
the
drawbridge,
alone
atop
a
chestnut
courser
caparisoned
in
red
and
blue.

He
loves
me
not.
Tully
had
a
craggy
face,
deeply
lined
and
windburnt
beneath
a
shock
of
stiff
grey
hair,
but
Jaime
could
still
see
the
great
knight
who
had
once
enthralled
a
squire
with
tales
of
the
Ninepenny
Kings.
Honor’s
hooves
clattered
against
the
planks
of
the
drawbridge.
Jaime
had
thought
long
and
hard
about
whether
to
wear
his
gold
armor
or
his
white
to
this
meeting;
in
the
end,
he’d
chosen
a
leather
jack
and
a
crimson
cloak.

He
drew
up
a
yard
from
Ser
Brynden,
and
inclined
his
head
to
the
older
man.
“Kingslayer,”
said
Tully.

That
he
would
make
that
name
the
first
word
from
his
mouth
spoke
volumes,
but
Jaime
was
resolved
to
keep
his
temper.
“Blackfish,”
he
responded.
“Thank
you
for
coming.”

“I
assume
you
have
returned
to
fulfill
the
oaths
you
swore
my
niece,”
Ser
Brynden
said.
“As
I
recall,
you
promised
Catelyn
her
daughters
in
return
for
your
freedom.”
His
mouth
tightened.
“Yet
I
do
not
see
the
girls.
Where
are
they?”

Must
he
make
me
say
it?
“I
do
not
have
them.”

“Pity.
Do
you
wish
to
resume
your
captivity?
Your
old
cell
is
still
available.
We
have
put
fresh
rushes
on
the
floor.”

And
a
nice
new
pail
for
me
to
shit
in,
I
don’t
doubt.
“That
was
thoughtful
of
you,
ser,
but
I
fear
I
must
decline.
I
prefer
the
comforts
of
my
pavilion.”

“Whilst
Catelyn
enjoys
the
comforts
of
her
grave.”

I
had
no
hand
in
Lady
Catelyn’s
death,
he
might
have
said,
and
her
daughters
were
gone
before
I
reached
King’s
Landing.
It
was
on
his
tongue
to
speak
of
Brienne
and
the
sword
he’d
given
her,
but
the
Blackfish
was
looking
at
him
the
way
that
Eddard
Stark
had
looked
at
him
when
he’d
found
him
on
the
Iron
Throne
with
the
Mad
King’s
blood
upon
his
blade.
“I
came
to
speak
of
the
living,
not
the
dead.
Of
those
who
need
not
die,
but
shall...”

“...unless
I
hand
you
Riverrun.
Is
this
where
you
threaten
to
hang
Edmure?”
Beneath
his
bushy
brows,
Tully’s
eyes
were
stone.
“My
nephew
is
marked
for
death
no
matter
what
I
do.
So
hang
him
and
be
done
with
it.
I
expect
that
Edmure
is
as
weary
of
standing
on
those
gallows
as
I
am
of
seeing
him
there.”

Ryman
Frey
is
a
bloody
fool.
His
mummer’s
show
with
Edmure
and
the
gallows
had
only
made
the
Blackfish
more
obdurate,
that
was
plain.
“You
hold
Lady
Sybelle
Westerling
and
three
of
her
children.
I’ll
return
your
nephew
in
exchange
for
them.”

“As
you
returned
Lady
Catelyn’s
daughters?”

Jaime
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
provoked.
“An
old
woman
and
three
children
for
your
liege
lord.
That’s
a
better
bargain
than
you
could
have
hoped
for.”

Ser
Brynden
smiled
a
hard
smile.
“You
do
not
lack
for
gall,
Kingslayer.
Bargaining
with
oathbreakers
is
like
building
on
quicksand,
though.
Cat
should
have
known
better
than
to
trust
the
likes
of
you.”

It
was
Tyrion
she
trusted
in,
Jaime
almost
said.
The
Imp
deceived
her
too.
“The
promises
I
made
to
Lady
Catelyn
were
wrung
from
me
at
swordpoint.”

“And
the
oath
you
swore
to
Aerys?”

He
felt
his
phantom
fingers
twitching.
“Aerys
is
no
part
of
this.
Will
you
exchange
the
Westerlings
for
Edmure?”

“No.
My
king
entrusted
his
queen
to
my
keeping,
and
I
swore
to
keep
her
safe.
I
will
not
hand
her
over
to
a
Frey
noose.”

“The
girl
has
been
pardoned.
No
harm
will
come
to
her.
You
have
my
word
on
that.”

“Your
word
of
honor?”
Ser
Brynden
raised
an
eyebrow.
“Do
you
even
know
what
honor
is?”

A
horse.
“I
will
swear
any
oath
that
you
require.”

“Spare
me,
Kingslayer.”

“I
want
to.
Strike
your
banners
and
open
your
gates
and
I’ll
grant
your
men
their
lives.
Those
who
wish
to
remain
at
Riverrun
in
service
to
Lord
Emmon
may
do
so.
The
rest
shall
be
free
to
go
where
they
will,
though
I
will
require
them
to
surrender
their
arms
and
armor.”

“I
wonder,
how
far
will
they
get,
unarmed,
before
‘outlaws’
set
upon
them?
You
dare
not
allow
them
to
join
Lord
Beric,
we
both
know
that.
And
what
of
me?
Will
I
be
paraded
through
King’s
Landing
to
die
like
Eddard
Stark?”

“I
will
permit
you
to
take
the
black.
Ned
Stark’s
bastard
is
the
Lord
Commander
on
the
Wall.”

The
Blackfish
narrowed
his
eyes.
“Did
your
father
arrange
for
that
as
well?
Catelyn
never
trusted
the
boy,
as
I
recall,
no
more
than
she
ever
trusted
Theon
Greyjoy.
It
would
seem
she
was
right
about
them
both.
No,
ser,
I
think
not.
I’ll
die
warm,
if
you
please,
with
a
sword
in
hand
running
red
with
lion
blood.”

“Tully
blood
runs
just
as
red,”
Jaime
reminded
him.
“If
you
will
not
yield
the
castle,
I
must
storm
it.
Hundreds
will
die.”

“Hundreds
of
mine.
Thousands
of
yours.”

“Your
garrison
will
perish
to
a
man.”

“I
know
that
song.
Do
you
sing
it
to
the
tune
of
‘The
Rains
of
Castamere’?
My
men
would
sooner
die
upon
their
feet
fighting
than
on
their
knees
beneath
a
headsman’s
axe.”

This
is
not
going
well.
“This
defiance
serves
no
purpose,
ser.
The
war
is
done,
and
your
Young
Wolf
is
dead.”

“Murdered
in
breach
of
all
the
sacred
laws
of
hospitality.”

“Frey’s
work,
not
mine.”

“Call
it
what
you
will.
It
stinks
of
Tywin
Lannister.”

Jaime
could
not
deny
that.
“My
father
is
dead
as
well.”

“May
the
Father
judge
him
justly.”

Now,
there’s
an
awful
prospect.
“I
would
have
slain
Robb
Stark
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
if
I
could
have
reached
him.
Some
fools
got
in
my
way.
Does
it
matter
how
the
boy
perished?
He’s
no
less
dead,
and
his
kingdom
died
when
he
did.”

“You
must
be
blind
as
well
as
maimed,
ser.
Lift
your
eyes,
and
you
will
see
that
the
direwolf
still
flies
above
our
walls.”

“I’ve
seen
him.
He
looks
lonely.
Harrenhal
has
fallen.
Seagard
and
Maidenpool.
The
Brackens
have
bent
the
knee,
and
they’ve
got
Tytos
Blackwood
penned
up
in
Raventree.
Piper,
Vance,
Mooton,
all
your
bannermen
have
yielded.
Only
Riverrun
remains.
We
have
twenty
times
your
numbers.”

“Twenty
times
the
men
require
twenty
times
the
food.
How
well
are
you
provisioned,
my
lord?”

“Well
enough
to
sit
here
till
the
end
of
days
if
need
be,
whilst
you
starve
inside
your
walls.”
He
told
the
lie
as
boldly
as
he
could
and
hoped
his
face
did
not
betray
him.

The
Blackfish
was
not
deceived.
“The
end
of
your
days,
perhaps.
Our
own
supplies
are
ample,
though
I
fear
we
did
not
leave
much
in
the
fields
for
visitors.”

“We
can
bring
food
down
from
the
Twins,”
said
Jaime,
“or
over
the
hills
from
the
west,
if
it
comes
to
that.”

“If
you
say
so.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
question
the
word
of
such
an
honorable
knight.”

The
scorn
in
his
voice
made
Jaime
bristle.
“There
is
a
quicker
way
to
decide
the
matter.
A
single
combat.
My
champion
against
yours.”

“I
was
wondering
when
you
would
get
to
that.”
Ser
Brynden
laughed.
“Who
will
it
be?
Strongboar?
Addam
Marbrand?
Black
Walder
Frey?”
He
leaned
forward.
“Why
not
you
and
me,
ser?”

That
would
have
been
a
sweet
fight
once,
Jaime
thought,
fine
fodder
for
the
singers.
“When
Lady
Catelyn
freed
me,
she
made
me
swear
not
to
take
arms
again
against
the
Starks
or
Tullys.”

“A
most
convenient
oath,
ser.”

His
face
darkened.
“Are
you
calling
me
a
coward?”

“No.
I
am
calling
you
a
cripple.”
The
Blackfish
nodded
at
Jaime’s
golden
hand.
“We
both
know
you
cannot
fight
with
that.”

“I
had
two
hands.”
Would
you
throw
your
life
away
for
pride?
a
voice
inside
him
whispered.
“Some
might
say
a
cripple
and
an
old
man
are
well
matched.
Free
me
from
my
vow
to
Lady
Catelyn
and
I
will
meet
you
sword
to
sword.
If
I
win,
Riverrun
is
ours.
If
you
slay
me,
we’ll
lift
the
siege.”

Ser
Brynden
laughed
again.
“Much
as
I
would
welcome
the
chance
to
take
that
golden
sword
away
from
you
and
cut
out
your
black
heart,
your
promises
are
worthless.
I
would
gain
nothing
from
your
death
but
the
pleasure
of
killing
you,
and
I
will
not
risk
my
own
life
for
that...
as
small
a
risk
as
that
may
be.”

It
was
a
good
thing
that
Jaime
wore
no
sword;
elsewise
he
would
have
ripped
his
blade
out,
and
if
Ser
Brynden
did
not
slay
him,
the
archers
on
the
walls
most
surely
would.
“Are
there
any
terms
you
will
accept?”
he
demanded
of
the
Blackfish.

“From
you?”
Ser
Brynden
shrugged.
“No.”

“Why
did
you
even
come
to
treat
with
me?”

“A
siege
is
deadly
dull.
I
wanted
to
see
this
stump
of
yours
and
hear
whatever
excuses
you
cared
to
offer
up
for
your
latest
enormities.
They
were
feebler
than
I’d
hoped.
You
always
disappoint,
Kingslayer.”
The
Blackfish
wheeled
his
mare
and
trotted
back
toward
Riverrun.
The
portcullis
descended
with
a
rush,
its
iron
spikes
biting
deep
into
the
muddy
ground.

Jaime
turned
Honor’s
head
about
for
the
long
ride
back
to
the
Lannister
siege
lines.
He
could
feel
the
eyes
on
him;
the
Tully
men
upon
their
battlements,
the
Freys
across
the
river.
If
they
are
not
blind,
they’ll
all
know
he
threw
my
offer
in
my
teeth.
He
would
need
to
storm
the
castle.
Well,
what’s
one
more
broken
vow
to
the
Kingslayer?
Just
more
shit
in
the
bucket.
Jaime
resolved
to
be
the
first
man
on
the
battlements.
And
with
this
golden
hand
of
mine,
most
like
the
first
to
fall.

Back
at
camp,
Little
Lew
held
his
bridle
whilst
Peck
gave
him
a
hand
down
from
the
saddle.
Do
they
think
I’m
such
a
cripple
that
I
cannot
dismount
by
myself?
“How
did
you
fare,
my
lord?”
asked
his
cousin
Ser
Daven.

“No
one
put
an
arrow
in
my
horse’s
rump.
Elsewise,
there
was
little
to
distinguish
me
from
Ser
Ryman.”
He
grimaced.
“So
now
he
must
needs
turn
the
Red
Fork
redder.”
Blame
yourself
for
that,
Blackfish.
You
left
me
little
choice.
“Assemble
a
war
council.
Ser
Addam,
Strongboar,
Forley
Prester,
those
river
lords
of
ours...
and
our
friends
of
Frey.
Ser
Ryman,
Lord
Emmon,
whoever
else
they
care
to
bring.”

They
gathered
quickly.
Lord
Piper
and
both
Lords
Vance
came
to
speak
for
the
repentant
lords
of
the
Trident,
whose
loyalties
would
shortly
be
put
to
the
test.
The
west
was
represented
by
Ser
Daven,
Strongboar,
Addam
Marbrand,
and
Forley
Prester.
Lord
Emmon
Frey
joined
them,
with
his
wife.
Lady
Genna
claimed
her
stool
with
a
look
that
dared
any
man
there
to
question
her
presence.
None
did.
The
Freys
sent
Ser
Walder
Rivers,
called
“Bastard
Walder,”
and
Ser
Ryman’s
firstborn
Edwyn,
a
pallid,
slender
man
with
a
pinched
nose
and
lank
dark
hair.
Under
a
blue
lambswool
cloak,
Edwyn
wore
a
jerkin
of
finely
tooled
grey
calfskin
with
ornate
scrollwork
worked
into
the
leather.
“I
speak
for
House
Frey,”
he
announced.
“My
father
is
indisposed
this
morning.”

Ser
Daven
gave
a
snort.
“Is
he
drunk,
or
just
greensick
from
last
night’s
wine?”

Edwyn
had
the
hard
mean
mouth
of
a
miser.
“Lord
Jaime,”
he
said,
“must
I
suffer
such
discourtesy?”

“Is
it
true?”
Jaime
asked
him.
“Is
your
father
drunk?”

Frey
pressed
his
lips
together
and
eyed
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
who
was
standing
beside
by
the
tent
flap
in
his
rusted
mail,
his
sword
poking
up
above
one
bony
shoulder.
“He...
my
father
has
a
bad
belly,
my
lord.
Red
wine
helps
with
his
digestion.”

“He
must
be
digesting
a
bloody
mammoth,”
said
Ser
Daven.
Strongboar
laughed,
and
Lady
Genna
chuckled.

“Enough,”
said
Jaime.
“We
have
a
castle
to
win.”
When
his
father
sat
in
council,
he
let
his
captains
speak
first.
He
was
resolved
to
do
the
same.
“How
shall
we
proceed?”

“Hang
Edmure
Tully,
for
a
start,”
urged
Lord
Emmon
Frey.
“That
will
teach
Ser
Brynden
that
we
mean
what
we
say.
If
we
send
Ser
Edmure’s
head
to
his
uncle,
it
may
move
him
to
yield.”

“Brynden
Blackfish
is
not
moved
so
easily.”
Karyl
Vance,
the
Lord
of
Wayfarer’s
Rest,
had
a
melancholy
look.
A
winestain
birthmark
covered
half
his
neck
and
one
side
of
his
face.
“His
own
brother
could
not
move
him
to
a
marriage
bed.”

Ser
Daven
shook
his
shaggy
head.
“We
have
to
storm
the
walls,
as
I’ve
been
saying
all
along.
Siege
towers,
scaling
ladders,
a
ram
to
break
the
gate,
that’s
what’s
needed
here.”

“I
will
lead
the
assault,”
said
Strongboar.
“Give
the
fish
a
taste
of
steel
and
fire,
that’s
what
I
say.”

“They
are
my
walls,”
protested
Lord
Emmon,
“and
that
is
my
gate
you
would
break.”
He
drew
his
parchment
out
of
his
sleeve
again.
“King
Tommen
himself
has
granted
me—”

“We’ve
all
seen
your
paper,
nuncle,”
snapped
Edwyn
Frey.
“Why
don’t
you
go
wave
it
at
the
Blackfish
for
a
change?”

“Storming
the
walls
will
be
a
bloody
business,”
said
Addam
Marbrand.
“I
propose
we
wait
for
a
moonless
night
and
send
a
dozen
picked
men
across
the
river
in
a
boat
with
muffled
oars.
They
can
scale
the
walls
with
ropes
and
grapnels,
and
open
the
gates
from
the
inside.
I
will
lead
them,
if
the
council
wishes.”

“Folly,”
declared
the
bastard,
Walder
Rivers.
“Ser
Brynden
is
no
man
to
be
cozened
by
such
tricks.”

“The
Blackfish
is
the
obstacle,”
agreed
Edwyn
Frey.
“His
helm
bears
a
black
trout
on
its
crest
that
makes
him
easy
to
pick
out
from
afar.
I
propose
that
we
move
our
siege
towers
close,
fill
them
full
of
bowmen,
and
feign
an
attack
upon
the
gates.
That
will
bring
Ser
Brynden
to
the
battlements,
crest
and
all.
Let
every
archer
smear
his
shafts
with
night
soil,
and
make
that
crest
his
mark.
Once
Ser
Brynden
dies,
Riverrun
is
ours.”

“Mine,”
piped
Lord
Emmon.
“Riverrun
is
mine.”

Lord
Karyl’s
birthmark
darkened.
“Will
the
night
soil
be
your
own
contribution,
Edwyn?
A
mortal
poison,
I
don’t
doubt.”

“The
Blackfish
deserves
a
nobler
death,
and
I’m
the
man
to
give
it
to
him.”
Strongboar
thumped
his
fist
on
the
table.
“I
will
challenge
him
to
single
combat.
Mace
or
axe
or
longsword,
makes
no
matter.
The
old
man
will
be
my
meat.”

“Why
would
he
deign
to
accept
your
challenge,
ser?”
asked
Ser
Forley
Prester.
“What
could
he
gain
from
such
a
duel?
Will
we
lift
the
siege
if
he
should
win?
I
do
not
believe
that.
Nor
will
he.
A
single
combat
would
accomplish
nought.”

“I
have
known
Brynden
Tully
since
we
were
squires
together,
in
service
to
Lord
Darry,”
said
Norbert
Vance,
the
blind
Lord
of
Atranta.
“If
it
please
my
lords,
let
me
go
and
speak
with
him
and
try
to
make
him
understand
the
hopelessness
of
his
position.”

“He
understands
that
well
enough,”
said
Lord
Piper.
He
was
a
short,
rotund,
bowlegged
man
with
a
bush
of
wild
red
hair,
the
father
of
one
of
Jaime’s
squires;
the
resemblance
to
the
boy
was
unmistakeable.
“The
man’s
not
bloody
stupid,
Norbert.
He
has
eyes...
and
too
much
sense
to
yield
to
such
as
these.”
He
made
a
rude
gesture
in
the
direction
of
Edwyn
Frey
and
Walder
Rivers.

Edwyn
bristled.
“If
my
lord
of
Piper
means
to
imply—”

“I
don’t
imply,
Frey.
I
say
what
I
mean
straight
out,
like
an
honest
man.
But
what
would
you
know
of
the
ways
of
honest
men?
You’re
a
treacherous
lying
weasel,
like
all
your
kin.
I’d
sooner
drink
a
pint
of
piss
than
take
the
word
of
any
Frey.”
He
leaned
across
the
table.
“Where
is
Marq,
answer
me
that?
What
have
you
done
with
my
son?
He
was
a
guest
at
your
bloody
wedding.”

“And
our
honored
guest
he
shall
remain,”
said
Edwyn,
“until
you
prove
your
loyalty
to
His
Grace,
King
Tommen.”

“Five
knights
and
twenty
men-at-arms
went
with
Marq
to
the
Twins,”
said
Piper.
“Are
they
your
guests
as
well,
Frey?”

“Some
of
the
knights,
perhaps.
The
others
were
served
no
more
than
they
deserved.
You’d
do
well
to
guard
your
traitor’s
tongue,
Piper,
unless
you
want
your
heir
returned
in
pieces.”

My
father’s
councils
never
went
like
this,
Jaime
thought,
as
Piper
came
lurching
to
his
feet.
“Say
that
with
a
sword
in
your
hand,
Frey,”
the
small
man
snarled.
“Or
do
you
only
fight
with
smears
of
shit?”

Frey’s
pinched
face
went
pale.
Beside
him
Walder
Rivers
rose.
“Edwyn
is
no
man
of
the
sword...
but
I
am,
Piper.
If
you
have
more
remarks
to
make,
come
outside
and
make
them.”

“This
is
a
war
council,
not
a
war,”
Jaime
reminded
them.
“Sit
down,
the
both
of
you.”
Neither
man
moved.
“Now!”

Walder
Rivers
seated
himself.
Lord
Piper
was
not
so
easy
to
cow.
He
muttered
a
curse
and
strode
from
the
tent.
“Shall
I
send
men
after
him
to
drag
him
back,
my
lord?”
Ser
Daven
asked
Jaime.

“Send
Ser
Ilyn,”
urged
Edywn
Frey.
“We
only
need
his
head.”

Karyl
Vance
turned
to
Jaime.
“Lord
Piper
spoke
from
grief.
Marq
is
his
firstborn
son.
Those
knights
who
accompanied
him
to
the
Twins
were
nephews
and
cousins
all.”

“Traitors
and
rebels
all,
you
mean,”
said
Edwyn
Frey.

Jaime
gave
him
a
cold
look.
“The
Twins
took
up
the
Young
Wolf’s
cause
as
well,”
he
reminded
the
Freys.
“Then
you
betrayed
him.
That
makes
you
twice
as
treacherous
as
Piper.”
He
enjoyed
seeing
Edwyn’s
thin
smile
curdle
up
and
die.
I
have
endured
sufficient
counsel
for
one
day,
he
decided.
“We’re
done.
See
to
your
preparations,
my
lords.
We
attack
at
first
light.”

The
wind
was
blowing
from
the
north
as
the
lords
filed
from
the
tent.
Jaime
could
smell
the
stink
of
the
Frey
encampments
beyond
the
Tumblestone.
Across
the
water
Edmure
Tully
stood
forlorn
atop
the
tall
grey
gallows,
with
a
rope
around
his
neck.

His
aunt
departed
last,
her
husband
at
her
heels.
“Lord
nephew,”
Emmon
protested,
“this
assault
on
my
seat...
you
must
not
do
this.”
When
he
swallowed,
the
apple
in
his
throat
moved
up
and
down.
“You
must
not.
I...
I
forbid
it.”
He
had
been
chewing
sourleaf
again;
pinkish
froth
glistened
on
his
lips.
“The
castle
is
mine,
I
have
the
parchment.
Signed
by
the
king,
by
little
Tommen.
I
am
the
lawful
lord
of
Riverrun,
and...”

“Not
so
long
as
Edmure
Tully
lives,”
said
Lady
Genna.
“He
is
soft
of
heart
and
soft
of
head,
I
know,
but
alive,
the
man
is
still
a
danger.
What
do
you
mean
to
do
about
that,
Jaime?”

It’s
the
Blackfish
who
is
the
danger,
not
Edmure.
“Leave
Edmure
to
me.
Ser
Lyle,
Ser
Ilyn.
Attend
me,
if
you
would.
It’s
time
I
paid
a
visit
to
those
gallows.”

The
Tumblestone
was
deeper
and
swifter
than
the
Red
Fork,
and
the
nearest
ford
was
leagues
upstream.
The
ferry
had
just
started
across
with
Walder
Rivers
and
Edwyn
Frey
when
Jaime
and
his
men
arrived
at
the
river.
As
they
awaited
its
return,
Jaime
told
them
what
he
wanted.
Ser
Ilyn
spat
into
the
river.

When
the
three
of
them
stepped
off
the
ferry
on
the
north
bank,
a
drunken
camp
follower
offered
to
pleasure
Strongboar
with
her
mouth.
“Here,
pleasure
my
friend,”
Ser
Lyle
said,
shoving
her
toward
Ser
Ilyn.
Laughing,
the
woman
moved
to
kiss
Payne
on
the
lips,
then
saw
his
eyes
and
shrank
away.

The
paths
between
the
cookfires
were
raw
brown
mud,
mixed
with
horse
dung
and
torn
up
by
hooves
and
boots
alike.
Everywhere
Jaime
saw
the
twin
towers
of
House
Frey
displayed
on
shield
and
banners,
blue
on
grey,
along
with
the
arms
of
lesser
Houses
sworn
to
the
Crossing:
the
heron
of
Erenford,
the
pitchfork
of
Haigh,
Lord
Charlton’s
three
sprigs
of
mistletoe.
The
arrival
of
the
Kingslayer
did
not
go
unnoticed.
An
old
woman
selling
piglets
from
a
basket
stopped
to
stare
at
him,
a
knight
with
a
half-familiar
face
went
to
one
knee,
and
two
men-at-arms
pissing
in
a
ditch
turned
and
sprayed
each
other.
“Ser
Jaime,”
someone
called
after
him,
but
he
strode
on
without
turning.
Around
him
he
glimpsed
the
faces
of
men
he’d
done
his
best
to
kill
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
where
the
Freys
had
fought
beneath
the
direwolf
banners
of
Robb
Stark.
His
golden
hand
hung
heavy
at
his
side.

Ryman
Frey’s
great
rectangular
pavilion
was
the
largest
in
the
camp;
its
grey
canvas
walls
were
made
of
sewn
squares
to
resemble
stonework,
and
its
two
peaks
evoked
the
Twins.
Far
from
being
indisposed,
Ser
Ryman
was
enjoying
some
entertainment.
The
sound
of
a
woman’s
drunken
laughter
drifted
from
within
the
tent,
mingled
with
the
strains
of
a
woodharp
and
a
singer’s
voice.
I
will
deal
with
you
later,
ser,
Jaime
thought.
Walder
Rivers
stood
before
his
own
modest
tent,
talking
with
two
men-at-arms.
His
shield
bore
the
arms
of
House
Frey
with
the
colors
reversed,
and
a
red
bend
sinister
across
the
towers.
When
the
bastard
saw
Jaime,
he
frowned.
There’s
a
cold
suspicious
look
if
ever
I
saw
one.
That
one
is
more
dangerous
than
any
of
his
trueborn
brothers.

The
gallows
had
been
raised
ten
feet
off
the
ground.
Two
spearmen
were
posted
at
the
foot
of
the
steps.
“You
can’t
go
up
without
Ser
Ryman’s
leave,”
one
told
Jaime.

“This
says
I
can.”
Jaime
tapped
his
sword
hilt
with
a
finger.
“The
question
is,
will
I
need
to
step
over
your
corpse?”

The
spearmen
moved
aside.

Atop
the
gallows,
the
Lord
of
Riverrun
stood
staring
at
the
trap
beneath
him.
His
feet
were
black
and
caked
with
mud,
his
legs
bare.
Edmure
wore
a
soiled
silken
tunic
striped
in
Tully
red
and
blue,
and
a
noose
of
hempen
rope.
At
the
sound
of
Jaime’s
footsteps,
he
raised
his
head
and
licked
his
dry,
cracked
lips.
“Kingslayer?”
The
sight
of
Ser
Ilyn
widened
his
eyes.
“Better
a
sword
than
a
rope.
Do
it,
Payne.”

“Ser
Ilyn,”
said
Jaime.
“You
heard
Lord
Tully.
Do
it.”

The
silent
knight
gripped
his
greatsword
with
both
hands.
Long
and
heavy
it
was,
sharp
as
common
steel
could
be.
Edmure’s
cracked
lips
moved
soundlessly.
As
Ser
Ilyn
drew
the
blade
back,
he
closed
his
eyes.
The
stroke
had
all
Payne’s
weight
behind
it.

“No!
Stop.
NO!”
Edwyn
Frey
came
panting
into
view.
“My
father
comes.
Fast
as
he
can.
Jaime,
you
must...”

“My
lord
would
suit
me
better,
Frey,”
said
Jaime.
“And
you
would
do
well
to
omit
must
from
any
speech
directed
at
me.”

Ser
Ryman
came
stomping
up
the
gallows
steps
in
company
with
a
straw-haired
slattern
as
drunk
as
he
was.
Her
gown
laced
up
the
front,
but
someone
had
undone
the
laces
to
the
navel,
so
her
breasts
were
spilling
out.
They
were
large
and
heavy,
with
big
brown
nipples.
On
her
head
a
circlet
of
hammered
bronze
sat
askew,
graven
with
runes
and
ringed
with
small
black
swords.
When
she
saw
Jaime,
she
laughed.
“Who
in
seven
hells
is
this
one?”

“The
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard,”
Jaime
returned
with
cold
courtesy.
“I
might
ask
the
same
of
you,
my
lady.”

“Lady?
I’m
no
lady.
I’m
the
queen.”

“My
sister
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that.”

“Lord
Ryman
crowned
me
his
very
self.”
She
gave
a
shake
of
her
ample
hips.
“I’m
the
queen
o’
whores.”

No,
Jaime
thought,
my
sweet
sister
holds
that
title
too.

Ser
Ryman
found
his
tongue.
“Shut
your
mouth,
slut,
Lord
Jaime
doesn’t
want
to
hear
some
harlot’s
nonsense.”
This
Frey
was
a
thickset
man
with
a
broad
face,
small
eyes,
and
a
soft
fleshy
set
of
chins.
His
breath
stank
of
wine
and
onions.

“Making
queens,
Ser
Ryman?”
Jaime
asked
softly.
“Stupid.
As
stupid
as
this
business
with
Lord
Edmure.”

“I
gave
the
Blackfish
warning.
I
told
him
Edmure
would
die
unless
the
castle
yielded.
I
had
this
gallows
built,
to
show
them
that
Ser
Ryman
Frey
does
not
make
idle
threats.
At
Seagard
my
son
Walder
did
the
same
with
Patrek
Mallister
and
Lord
Jason
bent
the
knee,
but...
the
Blackfish
is
a
cold
man.
He
refused
us,
so...”

“...you
hanged
Lord
Edmure?”

The
man
reddened.
“My
lord
grandfather...
if
we
hang
the
man
we
have
no
hostage,
ser.
Have
you
considered
that?”

“Only
a
fool
makes
threats
he’s
not
prepared
to
carry
out.
If
I
were
to
threaten
to
hit
you
unless
you
shut
your
mouth,
and
you
presumed
to
speak,
what
do
you
think
I’d
do?”

“Ser,
you
do
not
unders—”

Jaime
hit
him.
It
was
a
backhand
blow
delivered
with
his
golden
hand,
but
the
force
of
it
sent
Ser
Ryman
stumbling
backward
into
the
arms
of
his
whore.
“You
have
a
fat
head,
Ser
Ryman,
and
a
thick
neck
as
well.
Ser
Ilyn,
how
many
strokes
would
it
take
you
to
cut
through
that
neck?”

Ser
Ilyn
laid
a
single
finger
against
his
nose.

Jaime
laughed.
“An
empty
boast.
I
say
three.”

Ryman
Frey
went
to
his
knees.
“I
have
done
nothing...”

“...but
drink
and
whore.
I
know.”

“I
am
heir
to
the
Crossing.
You
can’t...”

“I
warned
you
about
talking.”
Jaime
watched
the
man
turn
white.
A
sot,
a
fool,
and
a
craven.
Lord
Walder
had
best
outlive
this
one,
or
the
Freys
are
done.
“You
are
dismissed,
ser.”

“Dismissed?”

“You
heard
me.
Go
away.”

“But...
where
should
I
go?”

“To
hell
or
home,
as
you
prefer.
See
that
you
are
not
in
camp
when
the
sun
comes
up.
You
may
take
your
queen
of
whores,
but
not
that
crown
of
hers.”
Jaime
turned
from
Ser
Ryman
to
his
son.
“Edwyn,
I
am
giving
you
your
father’s
command.
Try
not
to
be
so
stupid
as
your
sire.”

“That
ought
not
pose
much
difficulty,
my
lord.”

“Send
word
to
Lord
Walder.
The
crown
requires
all
his
prisoners.”
Jaime
waved
his
golden
hand.
“Ser
Lyle,
bring
him.”

Edmure
Tully
had
collapsed
facedown
on
the
scaffold
when
Ser
Ilyn’s
blade
sheared
the
rope
in
two.
A
foot
of
hemp
still
dangled
from
the
noose
about
his
neck.
Strongboar
grabbed
the
end
of
it
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet.
“A
fish
on
a
leash,”
he
said,
chortling.
“There’s
a
sight
I
never
saw
before.”

The
Freys
stepped
aside
to
let
them
pass.
A
crowd
had
gathered
below
the
scaffold,
including
a
dozen
camp
followers
in
various
states
of
disarray.
Jaime
noticed
one
man
holding
a
woodharp.
“You.
Singer.
Come
with
me.”

The
man
doffed
his
hat.
“As
my
lord
commands.”

No
one
said
a
word
as
they
walked
back
to
the
ferry,
with
Ser
Ryman’s
singer
trailing
after
them.
But
as
they
shoved
off
from
the
riverbank
and
made
for
the
south
side
of
the
Tumblestone,
Edmure
Tully
grabbed
Jaime
by
the
arm.
“Why?”

A
Lannister
pays
his
debts,
he
thought,
and
you’re
the
only
coin
that’s
left
to
me.
“Consider
it
a
wedding
gift.”

Edmure
stared
at
him
with
wary
eyes.
“A...
wedding
gift?”

“I
am
told
your
wife
is
pretty.
She’d
have
to
be,
for
you
to
bed
her
while
your
sister
and
your
king
were
being
murdered.”

“I
never
knew.”
Edmure
licked
his
cracked
lips.
“There
were
fiddlers
outside
the
bedchamber...”

“And
Lady
Roslin
was
distracting
you.”

“She...
they
made
her
do
it,
Lord
Walder
and
the
rest.
Roslin
never
wanted...
she
wept,
but
I
thought
it
was...”

“The
sight
of
your
rampant
manhood?
Aye,
that
would
make
any
woman
weep,
I’m
sure.”

“She
is
carrying
my
child.”

No,
Jaime
thought,
that’s
your
death
she
has
growing
in
her
belly.
Back
at
his
pavilion,
he
dismissed
Strongboar
and
Ser
Ilyn,
but
not
the
singer.
“I
may
have
need
of
a
song
shortly,”
he
told
the
man.
“Lew,
heat
some
bathwater
for
my
guest.
Pia,
find
him
some
clean
clothing.
Nothing
with
lions
on
it,
if
you
please.
Peck,
wine
for
Lord
Tully.
Are
you
hungry,
my
lord?”

Edmure
nodded,
but
his
eyes
were
still
suspicious.

Jaime
settled
on
a
stool
while
Tully
had
his
bath.
The
filth
came
off
in
grey
clouds.
“Once
you’ve
eaten,
my
men
will
escort
you
to
Riverrun.
What
happens
after
that
is
up
to
you.”

“What
do
you
mean?”

“Your
uncle
is
an
old
man.
Valiant,
yes,
but
the
best
part
of
his
life
is
done.
He
has
no
bride
to
grieve
for
him,
no
children
to
defend.
A
good
death
is
all
the
Blackfish
can
hope
for...
but
you
have
years
remaining,
Edmure.
And
you
are
the
rightful
lord
of
House
Tully,
not
him.
Your
uncle
serves
at
your
pleasure.
The
fate
of
Riverrun
is
in
your
hands.”

Edmure
stared.
“The
fate
of
Riverrun...”

“Yield
the
castle
and
no
one
dies.
Your
smallfolk
may
go
in
peace
or
stay
to
serve
Lord
Emmon.
Ser
Brynden
will
be
allowed
to
take
the
black,
along
with
as
many
of
the
garrison
as
choose
to
join
him.
You
as
well,
if
the
Wall
appeals
to
you.
Or
you
may
go
to
Casterly
Rock
as
my
captive
and
enjoy
all
the
comforts
and
courtesy
that
befits
a
hostage
of
your
rank.
I’ll
send
your
wife
to
join
you,
if
you
like.
If
her
child
is
a
boy,
he
will
serve
House
Lannister
as
a
page
and
a
squire,
and
when
he
earns
his
knighthood
we’ll
bestow
some
lands
upon
him.
Should
Roslin
give
you
a
daughter,
I’ll
see
her
well
dowered
when
she’s
old
enough
to
wed.
You
yourself
may
even
be
granted
parole,
once
the
war
is
done.
All
you
need
do
is
yield
the
castle.”

Edmure
raised
his
hands
from
the
tub
and
watched
the
water
run
between
his
fingers.
“And
if
I
will
not
yield?”

Must
you
make
me
say
the
words?
Pia
was
standing
by
the
flap
of
the
tent
with
her
arms
full
of
clothes.
His
squires
were
listening
as
well,
and
the
singer.
Let
them
hear,
Jaime
thought.
Let
the
world
hear.
It
makes
no
matter.
He
forced
himself
to
smile,
“You’ve
seen
our
numbers,
Edmure.
You’ve
seen
the
ladders,
the
towers,
the
trebuchets,
the
rams.
If
I
speak
the
command,
my
coz
will
bridge
your
moat
and
break
your
gate.
Hundreds
will
die,
most
of
them
your
own.
Your
former
bannermen
will
make
up
the
first
wave
of
attackers,
so
you’ll
start
your
day
by
killing
the
fathers
and
brothers
of
men
who
died
for
you
at
the
Twins.
The
second
wave
will
be
Freys,
I
have
no
lack
of
those.
My
westermen
will
follow
when
your
archers
are
short
of
arrows
and
your
knights
so
weary
they
can
hardly
lift
their
blades.
When
the
castle
falls,
all
those
inside
will
be
put
to
the
sword.
Your
herds
will
be
butchered,
your
godswood
will
be
felled,
your
keeps
and
towers
will
burn.
I’ll
pull
your
walls
down,
and
divert
the
Tumblestone
over
the
ruins.
By
the
time
I’m
done
no
man
will
ever
know
that
a
castle
once
stood
here.”
Jaime
got
to
his
feet.
“Your
wife
may
whelp
before
that.
You’ll
want
your
child,
I
expect.
I’ll
send
him
to
you
when
he’s
born.
With
a
trebuchet.”

Silence
followed
his
speech.
Edmure
sat
in
his
bath.
Pia
clutched
the
clothing
to
her
breasts.
The
singer
tightened
a
string
on
his
harp.
Little
Lew
hollowed
out
a
loaf
of
stale
bread
to
make
a
trencher,
pretending
that
he
had
not
heard.
With
a
trebuchet,
Jaime
thought.
If
his
aunt
had
been
there,
would
she
still
say
Tyrion
was
Tywin’s
son?

Edmure
Tully
finally
found
his
voice.
“I
could
climb
out
of
this
tub
and
kill
you
where
you
stand,
Kingslayer.”

“You
could
try.”
Jaime
waited.
When
Edmure
made
no
move
to
rise,
he
said,
“I’ll
leave
you
to
enjoy
your
food.
Singer,
play
for
our
guest
whilst
he
eats.
You
know
the
song,
I
trust.”

“The
one
about
the
rain?
Aye,
my
lord.
I
know
it.”

Edmure
seemed
to
see
the
man
for
the
first
time.
“No.
Not
him.
Get
him
away
from
me.”

“Why,
it’s
just
a
song,”
said
Jaime.
“He
cannot
have
that
bad
a
voice.”





CERSEI

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
had
been
old
for
as
long
as
she
had
known
him,
but
he
seemed
to
have
aged
another
hundred
years
in
the
past
three
nights.
It
took
him
an
eternity
to
bend
his
creaky
knee
before
her,
and
once
he
had
he
could
not
rise
again
until
Ser
Osmund
jerked
him
to
his
feet.

Cersei
studied
him
with
displeasure.
“Lord
Qyburn
informs
me
that
Lord
Gyles
has
coughed
his
last.”

“Yes,
Your
Grace.
I
did
my
best
to
ease
his
passing.”

“Did
you?”
The
queen
turned
to
Lady
Merryweather.
“I
did
say
I
wanted
Rosby
alive,
did
I
not?”

“You
did,
Your
Grace.”

“Ser
Osmund,
what
is
your
recollection
of
the
conversation?”

“You
commanded
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
to
save
the
man,
Your
Grace.
We
all
heard.”

Pycelle’s
mouth
opened
and
closed.
“Your
Grace
must
know,
I
did
all
that
could
be
done
for
the
poor
man.”

“As
you
did
for
Joffrey?
And
his
father,
my
own
beloved
husband?
Robert
was
as
strong
as
any
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
yet
you
lost
him
to
a
boar.
Oh,
and
let
us
not
forget
Jon
Arryn.
No
doubt
you
would
have
killed
Ned
Stark
as
well,
if
I
had
let
you
keep
him
longer.
Tell
me,
maester,
was
it
at
the
Citadel
that
you
learned
to
wring
your
hands
and
make
excuses?”

Her
voice
made
the
old
man
flinch.
“No
man
could
have
done
more,
Your
Grace.
I...
I
have
always
given
leal
service.”

“When
you
counseled
King
Aerys
to
open
his
gates
as
my
father’s
host
approached,
was
that
your
notion
of
leal
service?”

“That...
I
misjudged
the...”

“Was
that
good
counsel?”

“Your
Grace
must
surely
know...”

“What
I
know
is
that
when
my
son
was
poisoned
you
proved
to
be
of
less
use
than
Moon
Boy.
What
I
know
is
that
the
crown
has
desperate
need
of
gold,
and
our
lord
treasurer
is
dead.”

The
old
fool
seized
upon
that.
“I...
I
shall
draw
up
a
list
of
men
suitable
to
take
Lord
Gyles’s
place
upon
the
council.”

“A
list.”
Cersei
was
amused
by
his
presumption.
“I
can
well
imagine
the
sort
of
list
you
would
provide
me.
Greybeards
and
grasping
fools
and
Garth
the
Gross.”
Her
lips
tightened.
“You
have
been
much
in
Lady
Margaery’s
company
of
late.”

“Yes.
Yes,
I...
Queen
Margaery
has
been
most
distraught
about
Ser
Loras.
I
provide
Her
Grace
with
sleeping
draughts
and...
other
sorts
of
potions.”

“No
doubt.
Tell
me,
was
it
our
little
queen
who
commanded
you
to
kill
Lord
Gyles?”

“K-kill?”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle’s
eyes
grew
as
big
as
boiled
eggs.
“Your
Grace
cannot
believe...
it
was
his
cough,
by
all
the
gods,
I...
Her
Grace
would
not...
she
bore
Lord
Gyles
no
ill
will,
why
would
Queen
Margaery
want
him...”

“...dead?
Why,
to
plant
another
rose
on
Tommen’s
council.
Are
you
blind
or
bought?
Rosby
stood
in
her
way,
so
she
put
him
in
his
grave.
With
your
connivance.”

“Your
Grace,
I
swear
to
you,
Lord
Gyles
perished
from
his
cough.”
His
mouth
was
quivering.
“My
loyalty
has
always
been
to
the
crown,
to
the
realm...
t-to
House
Lannister.”

In
that
order?
Pycelle’s
fear
was
palpable.
He
is
ripe
enough.
Time
to
squeeze
the
fruit
and
taste
the
juice.
“If
you
are
as
leal
as
you
claim,
why
are
you
lying
to
me?
Do
not
trouble
to
deny
it.
You
began
to
dance
attendance
on
Maid
Margaery
before
Ser
Loras
went
to
Dragonstone,
so
spare
me
further
fables
about
how
you
want
only
to
console
our
good-daughter
in
her
grief.
What
brings
you
to
the
Maidenvault
so
often?
Not
Margaery’s
vapid
conversation,
surely?
Are
you
courting
that
pox-faced
septa
of
hers?
Diddling
little
Lady
Bulwer?
Do
you
play
the
spy
for
her,
informing
on
me
to
serve
her
plots?”

“I...
I
obey.
A
maester
takes
an
oath
of
service...”

“A
grand
maester
swears
to
serve
the
realm.”

“Your
Grace,
she...
she
is
the
queen...”

“I
am
the
queen.”

“I
meant...
she
is
the
king’s
wife,
and...”

“I
know
who
she
is.
What
I
want
to
know
is
why
she
has
need
of
you.
Is
my
good-daughter
unwell?”

“Unwell?”
The
old
man
plucked
at
the
thing
he
called
a
beard,
that
patched
growth
of
thin
white
hair
sprouting
from
the
loose
pink
wattles
under
his
chin.
“N-not
unwell,
Your
Grace,
not
as
such.
My
oaths
forbid
me
to
divulge...”

“Your
oaths
will
be
of
small
comfort
in
the
black
cells,”
she
warned
him.
“I’ll
hear
the
truth,
or
you’ll
wear
chains.”

Pycelle
collapsed
to
his
knees.
“I
beg
you...
I
was
your
lord
father’s
man,
and
a
friend
to
you
in
the
matter
of
Lord
Arryn.
I
could
not
survive
the
dungeons,
not
again...”

“Why
does
Margaery
send
for
you?”

“She
desires...
she...
she...”

“Say
it!”

He
cringed.
“Moon
tea,”
he
whispered.
“Moon
tea,
for...”

“I
know
what
moon
tea
is
for.”
There
it
is.
“Very
well.
Get
off
those
saggy
knees
and
try
to
remember
what
it
was
to
be
a
man.”
Pycelle
struggled
to
rise,
but
took
so
long
about
it
that
she
had
to
tell
Osmund
Kettleblack
to
give
him
another
yank.
“As
to
Lord
Gyles,
no
doubt
our
Father
Above
will
judge
him
justly.
He
left
no
children?”

“No
children
of
his
body,
but
there
is
a
ward...”

“...not
of
his
blood.”
Cersei
dismissed
that
annoyance
=======
SANSA

They
came
for
Sansa
on
the
third
day.

She
chose
a
simple
dress
of
dark
grey
wool,
plainly
cut
but
richly
embroidered
around
the
collar
and
sleeves.
Her
fingers
felt
thick
and
clumsy
as
she
struggled
with
the
silver
fastenings
without
the
benefit
of
servants.
Jeyne
Poole
had
been
confined
with
her,
but
Jeyne
was
useless.
Her
face
was
puffy
from
all
her
crying,
and
she
could
not
seem
to
stop
sobbing
about
her
father.

“I’m
certain
your
father
is
well,”
Sansa
told
her
when
she
had
finally
gotten
the
dress
buttoned
right.
“I’ll
ask
the
queen
to
let
you
see
him.”
She
thought
that
kindness
might
lift
Jeyne’s
spirits,
but
the
other
girl
just
looked
at
her
with
red,
swollen
eyes
and
began
to
cry
all
the
harder.
She
was
such
a
child.

Sansa
had
wept
too,
the
first
day.
Even
within
the
stout
walls
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
with
her
door
closed
and
barred,
it
was
hard
not
to
be
terrified
when
the
killing
began.
She
had
grown
up
to
the
sound
of
steel
in
the
yard,
and
scarcely
a
day
of
her
life
had
passed
without
hearing
the
clash
of
sword
on
sword,
yet
somehow
knowing
that
the
fighting
was
real
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
She
heard
it
as
she
had
never
heard
it
before,
and
there
were
other
sounds
as
well,
grunts
of
pain,
angry
curses,
shouts
for
help,
and
the
moans
of
wounded
and
dying
men.
In
the
songs,
the
knights
never
screamed
nor
begged
for
mercy.

So
she
wept,
pleading
through
her
door
for
them
to
tell
her
what
was
happening,
calling
for
her
father,
for
Septa
Mordane,
for
the
king,
for
her
gallant
prince.
If
the
men
guarding
her
heard
her
pleas,
they
gave
no
answer.
The
only
time
the
door
opened
was
late
that
night,
when
they
thrust
Jeyne
Poole
inside,
bruised
and
shaking.
“They’re
killing
everyone,”
the
steward’s
daughter
had
shrieked
at
her.
She
went
on
and
on.
The
Hound
had
broken
down
her
door
with
a
warhammer,
she
said.
There
were
bodies
on
the
stair
of
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
and
the
steps
were
slick
with
blood.
Sansa
dried
her
own
tears
as
she
struggled
to
comfort
her
friend.
They
went
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed,
cradled
in
each
other’s
arms
like
sisters.

The
second
day
was
even
worse.
The
room
where
Sansa
had
been
confined
was
at
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
From
its
window,
she
could
see
that
the
heavy
iron
portcullis
in
the
gatehouse
was
down,
and
the
drawbridge
drawn
up
over
the
deep
dry
moat
that
separated
the
keep-within-a-keep
from
the
larger
castle
that
surrounded
it.
Lannister
guardsmen
prowled
the
walls
with
spears
and
crossbows
to
hand.
The
fighting
was
over,
and
the
silence
of
the
grave
had
settled
over
the
Red
Keep.
The
only
sounds
were
Jeyne
Poole’s
endless
whimpers
and
sobs.

They
were
fed—hard
cheese
and
fresh-baked
bread
and
milk
to
break
their
fast,
roast
chicken
and
greens
at
midday,
and
a
late
supper
of
beef
and
barley
stew—but
the
servants
who
brought
the
meals
would
not
answer
Sansa’s
questions.
That
evening,
some
women
brought
her
clothes
from
the
Tower
of
the
Hand,
and
some
of
Jeyne’s
things
as
well,
but
they
seemed
nearly
as
frightened
as
Jeyne,
and
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
them,
they
fled
from
her
as
if
she
had
the
grey
plague.
The
guards
outside
the
door
still
refused
to
let
them
leave
the
room.

“Please,
I
need
to
speak
to
the
queen
again,”
Sansa
told
them,
as
she
told
everyone
she
saw
that
day.
“She’ll
want
to
talk
to
me,
I
know
she
will.
Tell
her
I
want
to
see
her,
please.
If
not
the
queen,
then
Prince
Joffrey,
if
you’d
be
so
kind.
We’re
to
marry
when
we’re
older.”

At
sunset
on
the
second
day,
a
great
bell
began
to
ring.
Its
voice
was
deep
and
sonorous,
and
the
long
slow
clanging
filled
Sansa
with
a
sense
of
dread.
The
ringing
went
on
and
on,
and
after
a
while
they
heard
other
bells
answering
from
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
Visenya’s
Hill.
The
sound
rumbled
across
the
city
like
thunder,
warning
of
the
storm
to
come.

“What
is
it?”
Jeyne
asked,
covering
her
ears.
“Why
are
they
ringing
the
bells?”

“The
king
is
dead.”
Sansa
could
not
say
how
she
knew
it,
yet
she
did.
The
slow,
endless
clanging
filled
their
room,
as
mournful
as
a
dirge.
Had
some
enemy
stormed
the
castle
and
murdered
King
Robert?
Was
that
the
meaning
of
the
fighting
they
had
heard?

She
went
to
sleep
wondering,
restless,
and
fearful.
Was
her
beautiful
Joffrey
the
king
now?
Or
had
they
killed
him
too?
She
was
afraid
for
him,
and
for
her
father.
If
only
they
would
tell
her
what
was
happening…

That
night
Sansa
dreamt
of
Joffrey
on
the
throne,
with
herself
seated
beside
him
in
a
gown
of
woven
gold.
She
had
a
crown
on
her
head,
and
everyone
she
had
ever
known
came
before
her,
to
bend
the
knee
and
say
their
courtesies.

The
next
morning,
the
morning
of
the
third
day,
Ser
Boros
Blount
of
the
Kingsguard
came
to
escort
her
to
the
queen.

Ser
Boros
was
an
ugly
man
with
a
broad
chest
and
short,
bandy
legs.
His
nose
was
flat,
his
cheeks
baggy
with
jowls,
his
hair
grey
and
brittle.
Today
he
wore
white
velvet,
and
his
snowy
cloak
was
fastened
with
a
lion
brooch.
The
beast
had
the
soft
sheen
of
gold,
and
his
eyes
were
tiny
rubies.
“You
look
very
handsome
and
splendid
this
morning,
Ser
Boros,”
Sansa
told
him.
A
lady
remembered
her
courtesies,
and
she
was
resolved
to
be
a
lady
no
matter
what.

“And
you,
my
lady,”
Ser
Boros
said
in
a
flat
voice.
“Her
Grace
awaits.
Come
with
me.”

There
were
guards
outside
her
door,
Lannister
men-at-arms
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms.
Sansa
made
herself
smile
at
them
pleasantly
and
bid
them
a
good
morning
as
she
passed.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
allowed
outside
the
chamber
since
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
had
led
her
there
two
mornings
past.
“To
keep
you
safe,
my
sweet
one,”
Queen
Cersei
had
told
her.
“Joffrey
would
never
forgive
me
if
anything
happened
to
his
precious.”

Sansa
had
expected
that
Ser
Boros
would
escort
her
to
the
royal
apartments,
but
instead
he
led
her
out
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
The
bridge
was
down
again.
Some
workmen
were
lowering
a
man
on
ropes
into
the
depths
of
the
dry
moat.
When
Sansa
peered
down,
she
saw
a
body
impaled
on
the
huge
iron
spikes
below.
She
averted
her
eyes
quickly,
afraid
to
ask,
afraid
to
look
too
long,
afraid
he
might
be
someone
she
knew.

They
found
Queen
Cersei
in
the
council
chambers,
seated
at
the
head
of
a
long
table
littered
with
papers,
candles,
and
blocks
of
sealing
wax.
The
room
was
as
splendid
as
any
that
Sansa
had
ever
seen.
She
stared
in
awe
at
the
carved
wooden
screen
and
the
twin
sphinxes
that
sat
beside
the
door.

“Your
Grace,”
Ser
Boros
said
when
they
were
ushered
inside
by
another
of
the
Kingsguard,
Ser
Mandon
of
the
curiously
dead
face,
“I’ve
brought
the
girl.”

Sansa
had
hoped
Joffrey
might
be
with
her.
Her
prince
was
not
there,
but
three
of
the
king’s
councillors
were.
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
sat
on
the
queen’s
left
hand,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
at
the
end
of
the
table,
while
Lord
Varys
hovered
over
them,
smelling
flowery.
All
of
them
were
clad
in
black,
she
realized
with
a
feeling
of
dread.
Mourning
clothes…

The
queen
wore
a
high-collared
black
silk
gown,
with
a
hundred
dark
red
rubies
sewn
into
her
bodice,
covering
her
from
neck
to
bosom.
They
were
cut
in
the
shape
of
teardrops,
as
if
the
queen
were
weeping
blood.
Cersei
smiled
to
see
her,
and
Sansa
thought
it
was
the
sweetest
and
saddest
smile
she
had
ever
seen.
“Sansa,
my
sweet
child,”
she
said,
“I
know
you’ve
been
asking
for
me.
I’m
sorry
that
I
could
not
send
for
you
sooner.
Matters
have
been
very
unsettled,
and
I
have
not
had
a
moment.
I
trust
my
people
have
been
taking
good
care
of
you?”

“Everyone
has
been
very
sweet
and
pleasant,
Your
Grace,
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
asking,”
Sansa
said
politely.
“Only,
well,
no
one
will
talk
to
us
or
tell
us
what’s
happened…”

“Us?”
Cersei
seemed
puzzled.

“We
put
the
steward’s
girl
in
with
her,”
Ser
Boros
said.
“We
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
her.”

The
queen
frowned.
“Next
time,
you
will
ask,”
she
said,
her
voice
sharp.
“The
gods
only
know
what
sort
of
tales
she’s
been
filling
Sansa’s
head
with.”

“Jeyne’s
scared,”
Sansa
said.
“She
won’t
stop
crying.
I
promised
her
I’d
ask
if
she
could
see
her
father.”

Old
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lowered
his
eyes.

“Her
father
is
well,
isn’t
he?”
Sansa
said
anxiously.
She
knew
there
had
been
fighting,
but
surely
no
one
would
harm
a
steward.
Vayon
Poole
did
not
even
wear
a
sword.

Queen
Cersei
looked
at
each
of
the
councillors
in
turn.
“I
won’t
have
Sansa
fretting
needlessly.
What
shall
we
do
with
this
little
friend
of
hers,
my
lords?”

Lord
Petyr
leaned
forward.
“I’ll
find
a
place
for
her.”

“Not
in
the
city,”
said
the
queen.

“Do
you
take
me
for
a
fool?”

The
queen
ignored
that.
“Ser
Boros,
escort
this
girl
to
Lord
Petyr’s
apartments
and
instruct
his
people
to
keep
her
there
until
he
comes
for
her.
Tell
her
that
Littlefinger
will
be
taking
her
to
see
her
father,
that
ought
to
calm
her
down.
I
want
her
gone
before
Sansa
returns
to
her
chamber.”

“As
you
command,
Your
Grace,”
Ser
Boros
said.
He
bowed
deeply,
spun
on
his
heel,
and
took
his
leave,
his
long
white
cloak
stirring
the
air
behind
him.

Sansa
was
confused.
“I
don’t
understand,”
she
said.
“Where
is
Jeyne’s
father?
Why
can’t
Ser
Boros
take
her
to
him
instead
of
Lord
Petyr
having
to
do
it?”
She
had
promised
herself
she
would
be
a
lady,
gentle
as
the
queen
and
as
strong
as
her
mother,
the
Lady
Catelyn,
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
scared
again.
For
a
second
she
thought
she
might
cry.
“Where
are
you
sending
her?
She
hasn’t
done
anything
wrong,
she’s
a
good
girl.”

“She’s
upset
you,”
the
queen
said
gently.
“We
can’t
be
having
that.
Not
another
word,
now.
Lord
Baelish
will
see
that
Jeyne’s
well
taken
care
of,
I
promise
you.”
She
patted
the
chair
beside
her.
“Sit
down,
Sansa.
I
want
to
talk
to
you.”

Sansa
seated
herself
beside
the
queen.
Cersei
smiled
again,
but
that
did
not
make
her
feel
any
less
anxious.
Varys
was
wringing
his
soft
hands
together,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
kept
his
sleepy
eyes
on
the
papers
in
front
of
him,
but
she
could
feel
Littlefinger
staring.
Something
about
the
way
the
small
man
looked
at
her
made
Sansa
feel
as
though
she
had
no
clothes
on.
Goose
bumps
pimpled
her
skin.

“Sweet
Sansa,”
Queen
Cersei
said,
laying
a
soft
hand
on
her
wrist.
“Such
a
beautiful
child.
I
do
hope
you
know
how
much
Joffrey
and
I
love
you.”

“You
do?”
Sansa
said,
breathless.
Littlefinger
was
forgotten.
Her
prince
loved
her.
Nothing
else
mattered.

The
queen
smiled.
“I
think
of
you
almost
as
my
own
daughter.
And
I
know
the
love
you
bear
for
Joffrey.”
She
gave
a
weary
shake
of
her
head.
“I
am
afraid
we
have
some
grave
news
about
your
lord
father.
You
must
be
brave,
child.”

Her
quiet
words
gave
Sansa
a
chill.
“What
is
it?”

“Your
father
is
a
traitor,
dear,”
Lord
Varys
said.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
lifted
his
ancient
head.
“With
my
own
ears,
I
heard
Lord
Eddard
swear
to
our
beloved
King
Robert
that
he
would
protect
the
young
princes
as
if
they
were
his
own
sons.
And
yet
the
moment
the
king
was
dead,
he
called
the
small
council
together
to
steal
Prince
Joffrey’s
rightful
throne.”

“No,”
Sansa
blurted.
“He
wouldn’t
do
that.
He
wouldn’t!”

The
queen
picked
up
a
letter.
The
paper
was
torn
and
stiff
with
dried
blood,
but
the
broken
seal
was
her
father’s,
the
direwolf
stamped
in
pale
wax.
“We
found
this
on
the
captain
of
your
household
guard,
Sansa.
It
is
a
letter
to
my
late
husband’s
brother
Stannis,
inviting
him
to
take
the
crown.”

“Please,
Your
Grace,
there’s
been
a
mistake.”
Sudden
panic
made
her
dizzy
and
faint.
“Please,
send
for
my
father,
he’ll
tell
you,
he
would
never
write
such
a
letter,
the
king
was
his
friend.”

“Robert
thought
so,”
said
the
queen.
“This
betrayal
would
have
broken
his
heart.
The
gods
are
kind,
that
he
did
not
live
to
see
it.”
She
sighed.
“Sansa,
sweetling,
you
must
see
what
a
dreadful
position
this
has
left
us
in.
You
are
innocent
of
any
wrong,
we
all
know
that,
and
yet
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
traitor.
How
can
I
allow
you
to
marry
my
son?”

“But
I
love
him,”
Sansa
wailed,
confused
and
frightened.
What
did
they
mean
to
do
to
her?
What
had
they
done
to
her
father?
It
was
not
supposed
to
happen
this
way.
She
had
to
wed
Joffrey,
they
were
betrothed,
he
was
promised
to
her,
she
had
even
dreamed
about
it.
It
wasn’t
fair
to
take
him
away
from
her
on
account
of
whatever
her
father
might
have
done.

“How
well
I
know
that,
child,”
Cersei
said,
her
voice
so
kind
and
sweet.
“Why
else
should
you
have
come
to
me
and
told
me
of
your
father’s
plan
to
send
you
away
from
us,
if
not
for
love?”

“It
was
for
love,”
Sansa
said
in
a
rush.
“Father
wouldn’t
even
give
me
leave
to
say
farewell.”
She
was
the
good
girl,
the
obedient
girl,
but
she
had
felt
as
wicked
as
Arya
that
morning,
sneaking
away
from
Septa
Mordane,
defying
her
lord
father.
She
had
never
done
anything
so
willful
before,
and
she
would
never
have
done
it
then
if
she
hadn’t
loved
Joffrey
as
much
as
she
did.
“He
was
going
to
take
me
back
to
Winterfell
and
marry
me
to
some
hedge
knight,
even
though
it
was
Joff
I
wanted.
I
told
him,
but
he
wouldn’t
listen.”
The
king
had
been
her
last
hope.
The
king
could
command
Father
to
let
her
stay
in
King’s
Landing
and
marry
Prince
Joffrey,
Sansa
knew
he
could,
but
the
king
had
always
frightened
her.
He
was
loud
and
rough-voiced
and
drunk
as
often
as
not,
and
he
would
probably
have
just
sent
her
back
to
Lord
Eddard,
if
they
even
let
her
see
him.
So
she
went
to
the
queen
instead,
and
poured
out
her
heart,
and
Cersei
had
listened
and
thanked
her
sweetly…
only
then
Ser
Arys
had
escorted
her
to
the
high
room
in
Maegor’s
Holdfast
and
posted
guards,
and
a
few
hours
later,
the
fighting
had
begun
outside.
“Please,”
she
finished,
“you
have
to
let
me
marry
Joffrey,
I’ll
be
ever
so
good
a
wife
to
him,
you’ll
see.
I’ll
be
a
queen
just
like
you,
I
promise.”

Queen
Cersei
looked
to
the
others.
“My
lords
of
the
council,
what
do
you
say
to
her
plea?”

“The
poor
child,”
murmured
Varys.
“A
love
so
true
and
innocent,
Your
Grace,
it
would
be
cruel
to
deny
it…
and
yet,
what
can
we
do?
Her
father
stands
condemned.”
His
soft
hands
washed
each
other
in
a
gesture
of
helpless
distress.

“A
child
born
of
traitor’s
seed
will
find
that
betrayal
comes
naturally
to
her,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“She
is
a
sweet
thing
now,
but
in
ten
years,
who
can
say
what
treasons
she
may
hatch?”

“No,”
Sansa
said,
horrified.
“I’m
not,
I’d
never…
I
wouldn’t
betray
Joffrey,
I
love
him,
I
swear
it,
I
do.”

“Oh,
so
poignant,”
said
Varys.
“And
yet,
it
is
truly
said
that
blood
runs
truer
than
oaths.”

“She
reminds
me
of
the
mother,
not
the
father,”
Lord
Petyr
Baelish
said
quietly.
“Look
at
her.
The
hair,
the
eyes.
She
is
the
very
image
of
Cat
at
the
same
age.”

The
queen
looked
at
her,
troubled,
and
yet
Sansa
could
see
kindness
in
her
clear
green
eyes.
“Child,”
she
said,
“if
I
could
truly
believe
that
you
were
not
like
your
father,
why
nothing
should
please
me
more
than
to
see
you
wed
to
my
Joffrey.
I
know
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart.”
She
sighed.
“And
yet,
I
fear
that
Lord
Varys
and
the
Grand
Maester
have
the
right
of
it.
The
blood
will
tell.
I
have
only
to
remember
how
your
sister
set
her
wolf
on
my
son.”

“I’m
not
like
Arya,”
Sansa
blurted.
“She
has
the
traitor’s
blood,
not
me.
I’m
good,
ask
Septa
Mordane,
she’ll
tell
you,
I
only
want
to
be
Joffrey’s
loyal
and
loving
wife.”

She
felt
the
weight
of
Cersei’s
eyes
as
the
queen
studied
her
face.
“I
believe
you
mean
it,
child.”
She
turned
to
face
the
others.
“My
lords,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
rest
of
her
kin
were
to
remain
loyal
in
this
terrible
time,
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
laying
our
fears
to
rest.”

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
stroked
his
huge
soft
beard,
his
wide
brow
furrowed
in
thought.
“Lord
Eddard
has
three
sons.”

“Mere
boys,”
Lord
Petyr
said
with
a
shrug.
“I
should
be
more
concerned
with
Lady
Catelyn
and
the
Tullys.”

The
queen
took
Sansa’s
hand
in
both
of
hers.
“Child,
do
you
know
your
letters?”

Sansa
nodded
nervously.
She
could
read
and
write
better
than
any
of
her
brothers,
although
she
was
hopeless
at
sums.

“I
am
pleased
to
hear
that.
Perhaps
there
is
hope
for
you
and
Joffrey
still…”

“What
do
you
want
me
to
do?”

“You
must
write
your
lady
mother,
and
your
brother,
the
eldest…
what
is
his
name?”

“Robb,”
Sansa
said.

“The
word
of
your
lord
father’s
treason
will
no
doubt
reach
them
soon.
Better
that
it
should
come
from
you.
You
must
tell
them
how
Lord
Eddard
betrayed
his
king.”

Sansa
wanted
Joffrey
desperately,
but
she
did
not
think
she
had
the
courage
to
do
as
the
queen
was
asking.
“But
he
never…
I
don’t…
Your
Grace,
I
wouldn’t
know
what
to
say…”

The
queen
patted
her
hand.
“We
will
tell
you
what
to
write,
child.
The
important
thing
is
that
you
urge
Lady
Catelyn
and
your
brother
to
keep
the
king’s
peace.”

“It
will
go
hard
for
them
if
they
don’t,”
said
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
“By
the
love
you
bear
them,
you
must
urge
them
to
walk
the
path
of
wisdom.”

“Your
lady
mother
will
no
doubt
fear
for
you
dreadfully,”
the
queen
said.
“You
must
tell
her
that
you
are
well
and
in
our
care,
that
we
are
treating
you
gently
and
seeing
to
your
every
want.
Bid
them
to
come
to
King’s
Landing
and
pledge
their
fealty
to
Joffrey
when
he
takes
his
throne.
If
they
do
that…
why,
then
we
shall
know
that
there
is
no
taint
in
your
blood,
and
when
you
come
into
the
flower
of
your
womanhood,
you
shall
wed
the
king
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
before
the
eyes
of
gods
and
men.”

…wed
the
king…
The
words
made
her
breath
come
faster,
yet
still
Sansa
hesitated.
“Perhaps…
if
I
might
see
my
father,
talk
to
him
about…”

“Treason?”
Lord
Varys
hinted.

“You
disappoint
me,
Sansa,”
the
queen
said,
with
eyes
gone
hard
as
stones.
“We’ve
told
you
of
your
father’s
crimes.
If
you
are
truly
as
loyal
as
you
say,
why
should
you
want
to
see
him?”

“I…
I
only
meant…”
Sansa
felt
her
eyes
grow
wet.
“He’s
not…
please,
he
hasn’t
been…
hurt,
or…
or…”

“Lord
Eddard
has
not
been
harmed,”
the
queen
said.

“But…
what’s
to
become
of
him?”

“That
is
a
matter
for
the
king
to
decide,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
announced
ponderously.

The
king!
Sansa
blinked
back
her
tears.
Joffrey
was
the
king
now,
she
thought.
Her
gallant
prince
would
never
hurt
her
father,
no
matter
what
he
might
have
done.
If
she
went
to
him
and
pleaded
for
mercy,
she
was
certain
he’d
listen.
He
had
to
listen,
he
loved
her,
even
the
queen
said
so.
Joff
would
need
to
punish
Father,
the
lords
would
expect
it,
but
perhaps
he
could
send
him
back
to
Winterfell,
or
exile
him
to
one
of
the
Free
Cities
across
the
narrow
sea.
It
would
only
have
to
be
for
a
few
years.
By
then
she
and
Joffrey
would
be
married.
Once
she
was
queen,
she
could
persuade
Joff
to
bring
Father
back
and
grant
him
a
pardon.

Only…
if
Mother
or
Robb
did
anything
treasonous,
called
the
banners
or
refused
to
swear
fealty
or
anything,
it
would
all
go
wrong.
Her
Joffrey
was
good
and
kind,
she
knew
it
in
her
heart,
but
a
king
had
to
be
stern
with
rebels.
She
had
to
make
them
understand,
she
had
to!

“I’ll…
I’ll
write
the
letters,”
Sansa
told
them.

With
a
smile
as
warm
as
the
sunrise,
Cersei
Lannister
leaned
close
and
kissed
her
gently
on
the
cheek.
“I
knew
you
would.
Joffrey
will
be
so
proud
when
I
tell
him
what
courage
and
good
sense
you’ve
shown
here
today.”

In
the
end,
she
wrote
four
letters.
To
her
mother,
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark,
and
to
her
brothers
at
Winterfell,
and
to
her
aunt
and
her
grandfather
as
well,
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
of
the
Eyrie,
and
Lord
Hoster
Tully
of
Riverrun.
By
the
time
she
had
done,
her
fingers
were
cramped
and
stiff
and
stained
with
ink.
Varys
had
her
father’s
seal.
She
warmed
the
pale
white
beeswax
over
a
candle,
poured
it
carefully,
and
watched
as
the
eunuch
stamped
each
letter
with
the
direwolf
of
House
Stark.

Jeyne
Poole
and
all
her
things
were
gone
when
Ser
Mandon
Moore
returned
Sansa
to
the
high
tower
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast.
No
more
weeping,
she
thought
gratefully.
Yet
somehow
it
seemed
colder
with
Jeyne
gone,
even
after
she’d
built
a
fire.
She
pulled
a
chair
close
to
the
hearth,
took
down
one
of
her
favorite
books,
and
lost
herself
in
the
stories
of
Florian
and
Jonquil,
of
Lady
Shella
and
the
Rainbow
Knight,
of
valiant
Prince
Aemon
and
his
doomed
love
for
his
brother’s
queen.

It
was
not
until
later
that
night,
as
she
was
drifting
off
to
sleep,
that
Sansa
realized
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
about
her
sister.





JON

“Othor,”
announced
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker,
“beyond
a
doubt.
And
this
one
was
Jafer
Flowers.”
He
turned
the
corpse
over
with
his
foot,
and
the
dead
white
face
stared
up
at
the
overcast
sky
with
blue,
blue
eyes.
“They
were
Ben
Stark’s
men,
both
of
them.”

My
uncle’s
men,
Jon
thought
numbly.
He
remembered
how
he’d
pleaded
to
ride
with
them.
Gods,
I
was
such
a
green
boy.
If
he
had
taken
me,
it
might
be
me
lying
here…

Jafer’s
right
wrist
ended
in
the
ruin
of
torn
flesh
and
splintered
bone
left
by
Ghost’s
jaws.
His
right
hand
was
floating
in
a
jar
of
vinegar
back
in
Maester
Aemon’s
tower.
His
left
hand,
still
at
the
end
of
his
arm,
was
as
black
as
his
cloak.

“Gods
have
mercy,”
the
Old
Bear
muttered.
He
swung
down
from
his
garron,
handing
his
reins
to
Jon.
The
morning
was
unnaturally
warm;
beads
of
sweat
dotted
the
Lord
Commander’s
broad
forehead
like
dew
on
a
melon.
His
horse
was
nervous,
rolling
her
eyes,
backing
away
from
the
dead
men
as
far
as
her
lead
would
allow.
Jon
led
her
off
a
few
paces,
fighting
to
keep
her
from
bolting.
The
horses
did
not
like
the
feel
of
this
place.
For
that
matter,
neither
did
Jon.

The
dogs
liked
it
least
of
all.
Ghost
had
led
the
party
here;
the
pack
of
hounds
had
been
useless.
When
Bass
the
kennelmaster
had
tried
to
get
them
to
take
the
scent
from
the
severed
hand,
they
had
gone
wild,
yowling
and
barking,
fighting
to
get
away.
Even
now
they
were
snarling
and
whimpering
by
turns,
pulling
at
their
leashes
while
Chett
cursed
them
for
curs.

It
is
only
a
wood,
Jon
told
himself,
and
they’re
only
dead
men.
He
had
seen
dead
men
before…

Last
night
he
had
dreamt
the
Winterfell
dream
again.
He
was
wandering
the
empty
castle,
searching
for
his
father,
descending
into
the
crypts.
Only
this
time
the
dream
had
gone
further
than
before.
In
the
dark
he’d
heard
the
scrape
of
stone
on
stone.
When
he
turned
he
saw
that
the
vaults
were
opening,
one
after
the
other.
As
the
dead
kings
came
stumbling
from
their
cold
black
graves,
Jon
had
woken
in
pitch-dark,
his
heart
hammering.
Even
when
Ghost
leapt
up
on
the
bed
to
nuzzle
at
his
face,
he
could
not
shake
his
deep
sense
of
terror.
He
dared
not
go
back
to
sleep.
Instead
he
had
climbed
the
Wall
and
walked,
restless,
until
he
saw
the
light
of
the
dawn
off
to
the
cast.
It
was
only
a
dream.
I
am
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch
now,
not
a
frightened
boy.

Samwell
Tarly
huddled
beneath
the
trees,
half-hidden
behind
the
horses.
His
round
fat
face
was
the
color
of
curdled
milk.
So
far
he
had
not
lurched
off
to
the
woods
to
retch,
but
he
had
not
so
much
as
glanced
at
the
dead
men
either.
“I
can’t
look,”
he
whispered
miserably.

“You
have
to
look,”
Jon
told
him,
keeping
his
voice
low
so
the
others
would
not
hear.
“Maester
Aemon
sent
you
to
be
his
eyes,
didn’t
he?
What
good
are
eyes
if
they’re
shut?”

“Yes,
but…
I’m
such
a
coward,
Jon.”

Jon
put
a
hand
on
Sam’s
shoulder.
“We
have
a
dozen
rangers
with
us,
and
the
dogs,
even
Ghost.
No
one
will
hurt
you,
Sam.
Go
ahead
and
look.
The
first
look
is
the
hardest.”

Sam
gave
a
tremulous
nod,
working
up
his
courage
with
a
visible
effort.
Slowly
he
swiveled
his
head.
His
eyes
widened,
but
Jon
held
his
arm
so
he
could
not
turn
away.

“Ser
Jaremy,”
the
Old
Bear
asked
gruffly,
“Ben
Stark
had
six
men
with
him
when
he
rode
from
the
Wall.
Where
are
the
others?”

Ser
Jaremy
shook
his
head.
“Would
that
I
knew.”

Plainly
Mormont
was
not
pleased
with
that
answer.
“Two
of
our
brothers
butchered
almost
within
sight
of
the
Wall,
yet
your
rangers
heard
nothing,
saw
nothing.
Is
this
what
the
Night’s
Watch
has
fallen
to?
Do
we
still
sweep
these
woods?”

“Yes,
my
lord,
but—”

“Do
we
still
mount
watches?”

“We
do,
but—”

“This
man
wears
a
hunting
horn.”
Mormont
pointed
at
Othor.
“Must
I
suppose
that
he
died
without
sounding
it?
Or
have
your
rangers
all
gone
deaf
as
well
as
blind?”

Ser
Jaremy
bristled,
his
face
taut
with
anger.
“No
horn
was
blown,
my
lord,
or
my
rangers
would
have
heard
it.
I
do
not
have
sufficient
men
to
mount
as
many
patrols
as
I
should
like…
and
since
Benjen
was
lost,
we
have
stayed
closer
to
the
Wall
than
we
were
wont
to
do
before,
by
your
own
command.”

The
Old
Bear
grunted.
“Yes.
Well.
Be
that
as
it
may.”
He
made
an
impatient
gesture.
“Tell
me
how
they
died.”

Squatting
beside
the
dead
man
he
had
named
Jafer
Flowers,
Ser
Jaremy
grasped
his
head
by
the
scalp.
The
hair
came
out
between
his
fingers,
brittle
as
straw.
The
knight
cursed
and
shoved
at
the
face
with
the
heel
of
his
hand.
A
great
gash
in
the
side
of
the
corpse’s
neck
opened
like
a
mouth,
crusted
with
dried
blood.
Only
a
few
ropes
of
pale
tendon
still
attached
the
head
to
the
neck.
“This
was
done
with
an
axe.”

“Aye,”
muttered
Dywen,
the
old
forester.
“Belike
the
axe
that
Othor
carried,
m’lord.”

Jon
could
feel
his
breakfast
churning
in
his
belly,
but
he
pressed
his
lips
together
and
made
himself
look
at
the
second
body.
Othor
had
been
a
big
ugly
man,
and
he
made
a
big
ugly
corpse.
No
axe
was
in
evidence.
Jon
remembered
Othor;
he
had
been
the
one
bellowing
the
bawdy
song
as
the
rangers
rode
out.
His
singing
days
were
done.
His
flesh
was
blanched
white
as
milk,
everywhere
but
his
hands.
His
hands
were
black
like
Jafer’s.
Blossoms
of
hard
cracked
blood
decorated
the
mortal
wounds
that
covered
him
like
a
rash,
breast
and
groin
and
throat.
Yet
his
eyes
were
still
open.
They
stared
up
at
the
sky,
blue
as
sapphires.

Ser
Jaremy
stood.
“The
wildlings
have
axes
too.”

Mormont
rounded
on
him.
“So
you
believe
this
is
Mance
Rayder’s
work?
This
close
to
the
Wall?”

“Who
else,
my
lord?”

Jon
could
have
told
him.
He
knew,
they
all
knew,
yet
no
man
of
them
would
say
the
words.
The
Others
are
only
a
story,
a
tale
to
make
children
shiver.
If
they
ever
lived
at
all,
they
are
gone
eight
thousand
years.
Even
the
thought
made
him
feel
foolish;
he
was
a
man
grown
now,
a
black
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch,
not
the
boy
who’d
once
sat
at
Old
Nan’s
feet
with
Bran
and
Robb
and
Arya.

Yet
Lord
Commander
Mormont
gave
a
snort.
“If
Ben
Stark
had
come
under
wildling
attack
a
half
day’s
ride
from
Castle
Black,
he
would
have
returned
for
more
men,
chased
the
killers
through
all
seven
hells
and
brought
me
back
their
heads.”

“Unless
he
was
slain
as
well,”
Ser
Jaremy
insisted.

The
words
hurt,
even
now.
It
had
been
so
long,
it
seemed
folly
to
cling
to
the
hope
that
Ben
Stark
was
still
alive,
but
Jon
Snow
was
nothing
if
not
stubborn.

“It
has
been
close
on
half
a
year
since
Benjen
left
us,
my
lord,”
Ser
Jaremy
went
on.
“The
forest
is
vast.
The
wildlings
might
have
fallen
on
him
anywhere.
I’d
wager
these
two
were
the
last
survivors
of
his
party,
on
their
way
back
to
us…
but
the
enemy
caught
them
before
they
could
reach
the
safety
of
the
Wall.
The
corpses
are
still
fresh,
these
men
cannot
have
been
dead
more
than
a
day…”

“No,”
Samwell
Tarly
squeaked.

Jon
was
startled.
Sam’s
nervous,
high-pitched
voice
was
the
last
he
would
have
expected
to
hear.
The
fat
boy
was
frightened
of
the
officers,
and
Ser
Jaremy
was
not
known
for
his
patience.

“I
did
not
ask
for
your
views,
boy,”
Rykker
said
coldly.

“Let
him
speak,
ser,”
Jon
blurted.

Mormont’s
eyes
flicked
from
Sam
to
Jon
and
back
again.
“If
the
lad
has
something
to
say,
I’ll
hear
him
out.
Come
closer,
boy.
We
can’t
see
you
behind
those
horses.”

Sam
edged
past
Jon
and
the
garrons,
sweating
profusely.
“My
lord,
it…
it
can’t
be
a
day
or…
look…
the
blood…”

“Yes?”
Mormont
growled
impatiently.
“Blood,
what
of
it?”

“He
soils
his
smallclothes
at
the
sight
of
it,”
Chett
shouted
out,
and
the
rangers
laughed.

Sam
mopped
at
the
sweat
on
his
brow.
“You…
you
can
see
where
Ghost…
Jon’s
direwolf…
you
can
see
where
he
tore
off
that
man’s
hand,
and
yet…
the
stump
hasn’t
bled,
look…”
He
waved
a
hand.
“My
father…
L-lord
Randyll,
he,
he
made
me
watch
him
dress
animals
sometimes,
when…
after…”
Sam
shook
his
head
from
side
to
side,
his
chins
quivering.
Now
that
he
had
looked
at
the
bodies,
he
could
not
seem
to
look
away.
“A
fresh
kill…
the
blood
would
still
flow,
my
lords.
Later…
later
it
would
be
clotted,
like
a…
a
jelly,
thick
and…
and…”
He
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
be
sick.
“This
man…
look
at
the
wrist,
it’s
all…
crusty…
dry…
like…”

Jon
saw
at
once
what
Sam
meant.
He
could
see
the
torn
veins
in
the
dead
man’s
wrist,
iron
worms
in
the
pale
flesh.
His
blood
was
a
black
dust.
Yet
Jaremy
Rykker
was
unconvinced.
“If
they’d
been
dead
much
longer
than
a
day,
they’d
be
ripe
by
now,
boy.
They
don’t
even
smell.”

Dywen,
the
gnarled
old
forester
who
liked
to
boast
that
he
could
smell
snow
coming
on,
sidled
closer
to
the
corpses
and
took
a
whiff.
“Well,
they’re
no
pansy
flowers,
but…
m’lord
has
the
truth
of
it.
There’s
no
corpse
stink.”

“They…
they
aren’t
rotting.”
Sam
pointed,
his
fat
finger
shaking
only
a
little.
“Look,
there’s…
there’s
no
maggots
or…
or…
worms
or
anything…
they’ve
been
lying
here
in
the
woods,
but
they…
they
haven’t
been
chewed
or
eaten
by
animals…
only
Ghost…
otherwise
they’re…
they’re…”

“Untouched,”
Jon
said
softly.
“And
Ghost
is
different.
The
dogs
and
the
horses
won’t
go
near
them.”

The
rangers
exchanged
glances;
they
could
see
it
was
true,
every
man
of
them.
Mormont
frowned,
glancing
from
the
corpses
to
the
dogs.
“Chett,
bring
the
hounds
closer.”

Chett
tried,
cursing,
yanking
on
the
leashes,
giving
one
animal
a
lick
of
his
boot.
Most
of
the
dogs
just
whimpered
and
planted
their
feet.
He
tried
dragging
one.
The
bitch
resisted,
growling
and
squirming
as
if
to
escape
her
collar.
Finally
she
lunged
at
him.
Chett
dropped
the
leash
and
stumbled
backward.
The
dog
leapt
over
him
and
bounded
off
into
the
trees.

“This…
this
is
all
wrong,”
Sam
Tarly
said
earnestly.
“The
blood…
there’s
bloodstains
on
their
clothes,
and…
and
their
flesh,
dry
and
hard,
but…
there’s
none
on
the
ground,
or…
anywhere.
With
those…
those…
those…”
Sam
made
himself
swallow,
took
a
deep
breath.
“With
those
wounds…
terrible
wounds…
there
should
be
blood
all
over.
Shouldn’t
there?”

Dywen
sucked
at
his
wooden
teeth.
“Might
be
they
didn’t
die
here.
Might
be
someone
brought
’em
and
left
’em
for
us.
A
warning,
as
like.”
The
old
forester
peered
down
suspiciously.
“And
might
be
I’m
a
fool,
but
I
don’t
know
that
Othor
never
had
no
blue
eyes
afore.”

Ser
Jaremy
looked
startled.
“Neither
did
Flowers,”
he
blurted,
turning
to
stare
at
the
dead
man.

A
silence
fell
over
the
wood.
For
a
moment
all
they
heard
was
Sam’s
heavy
breathing
and
the
wet
sound
of
Dywen
sucking
on
his
teeth.
Jon
squatted
beside
Ghost.

“Burn
them,”
someone
whispered.
One
of
the
rangers;
Jon
could
not
have
said
who.
“Yes,
burn
them,”
a
second
voice
urged.

The
Old
Bear
gave
a
stubborn
shake
of
his
head.
“Not
yet.
I
want
Maester
Aemon
to
have
a
look
at
them.
We’ll
bring
them
back
to
the
Wall.”

Some
commands
are
more
easily
given
than
obeyed.
They
wrapped
the
dead
men
in
cloaks,
but
when
Hake
and
Dywen
tried
to
tie
one
onto
a
horse,
the
animal
went
mad,
screaming
and
rearing,
lashing
out
with
its
hooves,
even
biting
at
Ketter
when
he
ran
to
help.
The
rangers
had
no
better
luck
with
the
other
garrons;
not
even
the
most
placid
wanted
any
part
of
these
burdens.
In
the
end
they
were
forced
to
hack
off
branches
and
fashion
crude
slings
to
carry
the
corpses
back
on
foot.
It
was
well
past
midday
by
the
time
they
started
back.

“I
will
have
these
woods
searched,”
Mormont
commanded
Ser
Jaremy
as
they
set
out.
“Every
tree,
every
rock,
every
bush,
and
every
foot
of
muddy
ground
within
ten
leagues
of
here.
Use
all
the
men
you
have,
and
if
you
do
not
have
enough,
borrow
hunters
and
foresters
from
the
stewards.
If
Ben
and
the
others
are
out
here,
dead
or
alive,
I
will
have
them
found.
And
if
there
is
anyone
else
in
these
woods,
I
will
know
of
it.
You
are
to
track
them
and
take
them,
alive
if
possible.
Is
that
understood?”

“It
is,
my
lord,”
Ser
Jaremy
said.
“It
will
be
done.”

After
that,
Mormont
rode
in
silence,
brooding.
Jon
followed
close
behind
him;
as
the
Lord
Commander’s
steward,
that
was
his
place.
The
day
was
grey,
damp,
overcast,
the
sort
of
day
that
made
you
wish
for
rain.
No
wind
stirred
the
wood;
the
air
hung
humid
and
heavy,
and
Jon’s
clothes
clung
to
his
skin.
It
was
warm.
Too
warm.
The
Wall
was
weeping
copiously,
had
been
weeping
for
days,
and
sometimes
Jon
even
imagined
it
was
shrinking.

The
old
men
called
this
weather
spirit
summer,
and
said
it
meant
the
season
was
giving
up
its
ghosts
at
last.
After
this
the
cold
would
come,
they
warned,
and
a
long
summer
always
meant
a
long
winter.
This
summer
had
lasted
ten
years.
Jon
had
been
a
babe
in
arms
when
it
began.

Ghost
ran
with
them
for
a
time
and
then
vanished
among
the
trees.
Without
the
direwolf,
Jon
felt
almost
naked.
He
found
himself
glancing
at
every
shadow
with
unease.
Unbidden,
he
thought
back
on
the
tales
that
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
them,
when
he
was
a
boy
at
Winterfell.
He
could
almost
hear
her
voice
again,
and
the
click-click-click
of
her
needles.
In
that
darkness,
the
Others
came
riding,
she
used
to
say,
dropping
her
voice
lower
and
lower.
Cold
and
dead
they
were,
and
they
hated
iron
and
fire
and
the
touch
of
the
sun,
and
every
living
creature
with
hot
blood
in
its
veins.
Holdfasts
and
cities
and
kingdoms
of
men
all
fell
before
them,
as
they
moved
south
on
pale
dead
horses,
leading
hosts
of
the
slain.
They
fed
their
dead
servants
on
the
flesh
of
human
children…

When
he
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
the
Wall
looming
above
the
tops
of
an
ancient
gnarled
oak,
Jon
was
vastly
relieved.
Mormont
reined
up
suddenly
and
turned
in
his
saddle.
“Tarly,”
he
barked,
“come
here.”

Jon
saw
the
start
of
fright
on
Sam’s
face
as
he
lumbered
up
on
his
mare;
doubtless
he
thought
he
was
in
trouble.
“You’re
fat
but
you’re
not
stupid,
boy,”
the
Old
Bear
said
gruffly.
“You
did
well
back
there.
And
you,
Snow.”

Sam
blushed
a
vivid
crimson
and
tripped
over
his
own
tongue
as
he
tried
to
stammer
out
a
courtesy.
Jon
had
to
smile.

When
they
emerged
from
under
the
trees,
Mormont
spurred
his
tough
little
garron
to
a
trot.
Ghost
came
streaking
out
from
the
woods
to
meet
them,
licking
his
chops,
his
muzzle
red
from
prey.
High
above,
the
men
on
the
Wall
saw
the
column
approaching.
Jon
heard
the
deep,
throaty
call
of
the
watchman’s
great
horn,
calling
out
across
the
miles;
a
single
long
blast
that
shuddered
through
the
trees
and
echoed
off
the
ice.

UUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo.

The
sound
faded
slowly
to
silence.
One
blast
meant
rangers
returning,
and
Jon
thought,
I
was
a
ranger
for
one
day,
at
least.
Whatever
may
come,
they
cannot
take
that
away
from
me.

Bowen
Marsh
was
waiting
at
the
first
gate
as
they
led
their
garrons
through
the
icy
tunnel.
The
Lord
Steward
was
red-faced
and
agitated.
“My
lord,”
he
blurted
at
Mormont
as
he
swung
open
the
iron
bars,
“there’s
been
a
bird,
you
must
come
at
once.”

“What
is
it,
man?”
Mormont
said
gruffly.

Curiously,
Marsh
glanced
at
Jon
before
he
answered.
“Maester
Aemon
has
the
letter.
He’s
waiting
in
your
solar.”

“Very
well.
Jon,
see
to
my
horse,
and
tell
Ser
Jaremy
to
put
the
dead
men
in
a
storeroom
until
the
maester
is
ready
for
them.”
Mormont
strode
away
grumbling.

As
they
led
their
horses
back
to
the
stable,
Jon
was
uncomfortably
aware
that
people
were
watching
him.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
was
drilling
his
boys
in
the
yard,
but
he
broke
off
to
stare
at
Jon,
a
faint
half
smile
on
his
lips.
One-armed
Donal
Noye
stood
in
the
door
of
the
armory.
“The
gods
be
with
you,
Snow,”
he
called
out.

Something’s
wrong,
Jon
thought.
Something’s
very
wrong.

The
dead
men
were
carried
to
one
of
the
storerooms
along
the
base
of
the
Wall,
a
dark
cold
cell
chiseled
from
the
ice
and
used
to
keep
meat
and
grain
and
sometimes
even
beer.
Jon
saw
that
Mormont’s
horse
was
fed
and
watered
and
groomed
before
he
took
care
of
his
own.
Afterward
he
sought
out
his
friends.
Grenn
and
Toad
were
on
watch,
but
he
found
Pyp
in
the
common
hall.
“What’s
happened?”
he
asked.

Pyp
lowered
his
voice.
“The
king’s
dead.”

Jon
was
stunned.
Robert
Baratheon
had
looked
old
and
fat
when
he
visited
Winterfell,
yet
he’d
seemed
hale
enough,
and
there’d
been
no
talk
of
illness.
“How
can
you
know?”

“One
of
the
guards
overheard
Clydas
reading
the
letter
to
Maester
Aemon.”
Pyp
leaned
close.
“Jon,
I’m
sorry.
He
was
your
father’s
friend,
wasn’t
he?”

“They
were
as
close
as
brothers,
once.”
Jon
wondered
if
Joffrey
would
keep
his
father
as
the
King’s
Hand.
It
did
not
seem
likely.
That
might
mean
Lord
Eddard
would
return
to
Winterfell,
and
his
sisters
as
well.
He
might
even
be
allowed
to
visit
them,
with
Lord
Mormont’s
permission.
It
would
be
good
to
see
Arya’s
grin
again
and
to
talk
with
his
father.
I
will
ask
him
about
my
mother,
he
resolved.
I
am
a
man
now,
it
is
past
time
he
told
me.
Even
if
she
was
a
whore,
I
don’t
care,
I
want
to
know.

“I
heard
Hake
say
the
dead
men
were
your
uncle’s,”
Pyp
said.

“Yes,”
Jon
replied.
“Two
of
the
six
he
took
with
him.
They’d
been
dead
a
long
time,
only…
the
bodies
are
queer.”

“Queer?”
Pyp
was
all
curiosity.
“How
queer?”

“Sam
will
tell
you.”
Jon
did
not
want
to
talk
of
it.
“I
should
see
if
the
Old
Bear
has
need
of
me.”

He
walked
to
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower
alone,
with
a
curious
sense
of
apprehension.
The
brothers
on
guard
eyed
him
solemnly
as
he
approached.
“The
Old
Bear’s
in
his
solar,”
one
of
them
announced.
“He
was
asking
for
you.”

Jon
nodded.
He
should
have
come
straight
from
the
stable.
He
climbed
the
tower
steps
briskly.
He
wants
wine
or
a
fire
in
his
hearth,
that’s
all,
he
told
himself.

When
he
entered
the
solar,
Mormont’s
raven
screamed
at
him.
“Corn!”
the
bird
shrieked.
“Corn!
Corn!
Corn!”

“Don’t
you
believe
it,
I
just
fed
him,”
the
Old
Bear
growled.
He
was
seated
by
the
window,
reading
a
letter.
“Bring
me
a
cup
of
wine,
and
pour
one
for
yourself.”

“For
myself,
my
lord?”

Mormont
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
letter
to
stare
at
Jon.
There
was
pity
in
that
look;
he
could
taste
it.
“You
heard
me.”

Jon
poured
with
exaggerated
care,
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
drawing
out
the
act.
When
the
cups
were
filled,
he
would
have
no
choice
but
to
face
whatever
was
in
that
letter.
Yet
all
too
soon,
they
were
filled.
“Sit,
boy,”
Mormont
commanded
him.
“Drink.”

Jon
remained
standing.
“It’s
my
father,
isn’t
it?”

The
Old
Bear
tapped
the
letter
with
a
finger.
“Your
father
and
the
king,”
he
rumbled.
“I
won’t
lie
to
you,
it’s
grievous
news.
I
never
thought
to
see
another
king,
not
at
my
age,
with
Robert
half
my
years
and
strong
as
a
bull.”
He
took
a
gulp
of
wine.
“They
say
the
king
loved
to
hunt.
The
things
we
love
destroy
us
every
time,
lad.
Remember
that.
My
son
loved
that
young
wife
of
his.
Vain
woman.
If
not
for
her,
he
would
never
have
thought
to
sell
those
poachers.”

Jon
could
scarcely
follow
what
he
was
saying.
“My
lord,
I
don’t
understand.
What’s
happened
to
my
father?”

“I
told
you
to
sit,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“Sit,”
the
raven
screamed.
“And
have
a
drink,
damn
you.
That’s
a
command,
Snow.”

Jon
sat,
and
took
a
sip
of
wine.

“Lord
Eddard
has
been
imprisoned.
He
is
charged
with
treason.
It
is
said
he
plotted
with
Robert’s
brothers
to
deny
the
throne
to
Prince
Joffrey.”

“No,”
Jon
said
at
once.
“That
couldn’t
be.
My
father
would
never
betray
the
king!”

“Be
that
as
it
may,”
said
Mormont.
“It
is
not
for
me
to
say.
Nor
for
you.”

“But
it’s
a
lie,”
Jon
insisted.
How
could
they
think
his
father
was
a
traitor,
had
they
all
gone
mad?
Lord
Eddard
Stark
would
never
dishonor
himself…
would
he?

He
fathered
a
bastard,
a
small
voice
whispered
inside
him.
Where
was
the
honor
in
that?
And
your
mother,
what
of
her?
He
will
not
even
speak
her
name.

“My
lord,
what
will
happen
to
him?
Will
they
kill
him?”

“As
to
that,
I
cannot
say,
lad.
I
mean
to
send
a
letter.
I
knew
some
of
the
king’s
councillors
in
my
youth.
Old
Pycelle,
Lord
Stannis,
Ser
Barristan…
Whatever
your
father
has
done,
or
hasn’t
done,
he
is
a
great
lord.
He
must
be
allowed
to
take
the
black
and
join
us
here.
Gods
knows,
we
need
men
of
Lord
Eddard’s
ability.”

Jon
knew
that
other
men
accused
of
treason
had
been
allowed
to
redeem
their
honor
on
the
Wall
in
days
past.
Why
not
Lord
Eddard?
His
father
here.
That
was
a
strange
thought,
and
strangely
uncomfortable.
It
would
be
a
monstrous
injustice
to
strip
him
of
Winterfell
and
force
him
to
take
the
black,
and
yet
if
it
meant
his
life…

And
would
Joffrey
allow
it?
He
remembered
the
prince
at
Winterfell,
the
way
he’d
mocked
Robb
and
Ser
Rodrik
in
the
yard.
Jon
himself
he
had
scarcely
even
noticed;
bastards
were
beneath
even
his
contempt.
“My
lord,
will
the
king
listen
to
you?”

The
Old
Bear
shrugged.
“A
boy
king…
I
imagine
he’ll
listen
to
his
mother.
A
pity
the
dwarf
isn’t
with
them.
He’s
the
lad’s
uncle,
and
he
saw
our
need
when
he
visited
us.
It
was
a
bad
thing,
your
lady
mother
taking
him
captive—”

“Lady
Stark
is
not
my
mother,”
Jon
reminded
him
sharply.
Tyrion
Lannister
had
been
a
friend
to
him.
If
Lord
Eddard
was
killed,
she
would
be
as
much
to
blame
as
the
queen.
“My
lord,
what
of
my
sisters?
Arya
and
Sansa,
they
were
with
my
father,
do
you
know—”

“Pycelle
makes
no
mention
of
them,
but
doubtless
they’ll
be
treated
gently.
I
will
ask
about
them
when
I
write.”
Mormont
shook
his
head.
“This
could
not
have
happened
at
a
worse
time.
If
ever
the
realm
needed
a
strong
king…
there
are
dark
days
and
cold
nights
ahead,
I
feel
it
in
my
bones…”
He
gave
Jon
a
long
shrewd
look.
“I
hope
you
are
not
thinking
of
doing
anything
stupid,
boy.”

He’s
my
father,
Jon
wanted
to
say,
but
he
knew
that
Mormont
would
not
want
to
hear
it.
His
throat
was
dry.
He
made
himself
take
another
sip
of
wine.

“Your
duty
is
here
now,”
the
Lord
Commander
reminded
him.
“Your
old
life
ended
when
you
took
the
black.”
His
bird
made
a
raucous
echo.
“Black.”
Mormont
took
no
notice.
“Whatever
they
do
in
King’s
Landing
is
none
of
our
concern.”
When
Jon
did
not
answer,
the
old
man
finished
his
wine
and
said,
“You’re
free
to
go.
I’ll
have
no
further
need
of
you
today.
On
the
morrow
you
can
help
me
write
that
letter.”

Jon
did
not
remember
standing
or
leaving
the
solar.
The
next
he
knew,
he
was
descending
the
tower
steps,
thinking,
This
is
my
father,
my
sisters,
how
can
it
be
none
of
my
concern?

Outside,
one
of
the
guards
looked
at
him
and
said,
“Be
strong,
boy.
The
gods
are
cruel.”

They
know,
Jon
realized.
“My
father
is
no
traitor,”
he
said
hoarsely.
Even
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat,
as
if
to
choke
him.
The
wind
was
rising,
and
it
seemed
colder
in
the
yard
than
it
had
when
he’d
gone
in.
Spirit
summer
was
drawing
to
an
end.

The
rest
of
the
afternoon
passed
as
if
in
a
dream.
Jon
could
not
have
said
where
he
walked,
what
he
did,
who
he
spoke
with.
Ghost
was
with
him,
he
knew
that
much.
The
silent
presence
of
the
direwolf
gave
him
comfort.
The
girls
do
not
even
have
that
much,
he
thought.
Their
wolves
might
have
kept
them
safe,
but
Lady
is
dead
and
Nymeria’s
lost,
they’re
all
alone.

A
north
wind
had
begun
to
blow
by
the
time
the
sun
went
down.
Jon
could
hear
it
skirling
against
the
Wall
and
over
the
icy
battlements
as
he
went
to
the
common
hall
for
the
evening
meal.
Hobb
had
cooked
up
a
venison
stew,
thick
with
barley,
onions,
and
carrots.
When
he
spooned
an
extra
portion
onto
Jon’s
plate
and
gave
him
the
crusty
heel
of
the
bread,
he
knew
what
it
meant.
He
knows.
He
looked
around
the
hall,
saw
heads
turn
quickly,
eyes
politely
averted.
They
all
know.

His
friends
rallied
to
him.
“We
asked
the
septon
to
light
a
candle
for
your
father,”
Matthar
told
him.
“It’s
a
lie,
we
all
know
it’s
a
lie,
even
Grenn
knows
it’s
a
lie,”
Pyp
chimed
in.
Grenn
nodded,
and
Sam
clasped
Jon’s
hand,
“You’re
my
brother
now,
so
he’s
my
father
too,”
the
fat
boy
said.
“If
you
want
to
go
out
to
the
weirwoods
and
pray
to
the
old
gods,
I’ll
go
with
you.”

The
weirwoods
were
beyond
the
Wall,
yet
he
knew
Sam
meant
what
he
said.
They
are
my
brothers,
he
thought.
As
much
as
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon…

And
then
he
heard
the
laughter,
sharp
and
cruel
as
a
whip,
and
the
voice
of
Ser
Alliser
Thorne.
“Not
only
a
bastard,
but
a
traitor’s
bastard,”
he
was
telling
the
men
around
him.

In
the
blink
of
an
eye,
Jon
had
vaulted
onto
the
table,
dagger
in
his
hand.
Pyp
made
a
grab
for
him,
but
he
wrenched
his
leg
away,
and
then
he
was
sprinting
down
the
table
and
kicking
the
bowl
from
Ser
Alliser’s
hand.
Stew
went
flying
everywhere,
spattering
the
brothers.
Thorne
recoiled.
People
were
shouting,
but
Jon
Snow
did
not
hear
them.
He
lunged
at
Ser
Alliser’s
face
with
the
dagger,
slashing
at
those
cold
onyx
eyes,
but
Sam
threw
himself
between
them
and
before
Jon
could
get
around
him,
Pyp
was
on
his
back
clinging
like
a
monkey,
and
Grenn
was
grabbing
his
arm
while
Toad
wrenched
the
knife
from
his
fingers.

Later,
much
later,
after
they
had
marched
him
back
to
his
sleeping
cell,
Mormont
came
down
to
see
him,
raven
on
his
shoulder.
“I
told
you
not
to
do
anything
stupid,
boy,”
the
Old
Bear
said.
“Boy,”
the
bird
chorused.
Mormont
shook
his
head,
disgusted.
“And
to
think
I
had
high
hopes
for
you.”

They
took
his
knife
and
his
sword
and
told
him
he
was
not
to
leave
his
cell
until
the
high
officers
met
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
with
him.
And
then
they
placed
a
guard
outside
his
door
to
make
certain
he
obeyed.
His
friends
were
not
allowed
to
see
him,
but
the
Old
Bear
did
relent
and
permit
him
Ghost,
so
he
was
not
utterly
alone.

“My
father
is
no
traitor,”
he
told
the
direwolf
when
the
rest
had
gone.
Ghost
looked
at
him
in
silence.
Jon
slumped
against
the
wall,
hands
around
his
knees,
and
stared
at
the
candle
on
the
table
beside
his
narrow
bed.
The
flame
flickered
and
swayed,
the
shadows
moved
around
him,
the
room
seemed
to
grow
darker
and
colder.
I
will
not
sleep
tonight,
Jon
thought.

Yet
he
must
have
dozed.
When
he
woke,
his
legs
were
stiff
and
cramped
and
the
candle
had
long
since
burned
out.
Ghost
stood
on
his
hind
legs,
scrabbling
at
the
door.
Jon
was
startled
to
see
how
tall
he’d
grown.
“Ghost,
what
is
it?”
he
called
softly.
The
direwolf
turned
his
head
and
looked
down
at
him,
baring
his
fangs
in
a
silent
snarl.
Has
he
gone
mad?
Jon
wondered.
“It’s
me,
Ghost,”
he
murmured,
trying
not
to
sound
afraid.
Yet
he
was
trembling,
violently.
When
had
it
gotten
so
cold?

Ghost
backed
away
from
the
door.
There
were
deep
gouges
where
he’d
raked
the
wood.
Jon
watched
him
with
mounting
disquiet.
“There’s
someone
out
there,
isn’t
there?”
he
whispered.
Crouching,
the
direwolf
crept
backward,
white
fur
rising
on
the
back
of
his
neck.
The
guard,
he
thought,
they
left
a
man
to
guard
my
door,
Ghost
smells
him
through
the
door,
that’s
all
it
is.

Slowly,
Jon
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
shivering
uncontrollably,
wishing
he
still
had
a
sword.
Three
quick
steps
brought
him
to
the
door.
He
grabbed
the
handle
and
pulled
it
inward.
The
creak
of
the
hinges
almost
made
him
jump.

His
guard
was
sprawled
bonelessly
across
the
narrow
steps,
looking
up
at
him.
Looking
up
at
him,
even
though
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach.
His
head
had
been
twisted
completely
around.

It
can’t
be,
Jon
told
himself.
This
is
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower,
it’s
guarded
day
and
night,
this
couldn’t
happen,
it’s
a
dream,
I’m
having
a
nightmare.

Ghost
slid
past
him,
out
the
door.
The
wolf
started
up
the
steps,
stopped,
looked
back
at
Jon.
That
was
when
he
heard
it;
the
soft
scrape
of
a
boot
on
stone,
the
sound
of
a
latch
turning.
The
sounds
came
from
above.
From
the
Lord
Commander’s
chambers.

A
nightmare
this
might
be,
yet
it
was
no
dream.

The
guard’s
sword
was
in
its
sheath.
Jon
knelt
and
worked
it
free.
The
heft
of
steel
in
his
fist
made
him
bolder.
He
moved
up
the
steps,
Ghost
padding
silently
before
him.
Shadows
lurked
in
every
turn
of
the
stair.
Jon
crept
up
warily,
probing
any
suspicious
darkness
with
the
point
of
his
sword.

Suddenly
he
heard
the
shriek
of
Mormont’s
raven.
“Corn,”
the
bird
was
screaming.
“Corn,
corn,
corn,
corn,
corn,
corn.”
Ghost
bounded
ahead,
and
Jon
came
scrambling
after.
The
door
to
Mormont’s
solar
was
wide
open.
The
direwolf
plunged
through.
Jon
stopped
in
the
doorway,
blade
in
hand,
giving
his
eyes
a
moment
to
adjust.
Heavy
drapes
had
been
pulled
across
the
windows,
and
the
darkness
was
black
as
ink.
“Who’s
there?”
he
called
out.

Then
he
saw
it,
a
shadow
in
the
shadows,
sliding
toward
the
inner
door
that
led
to
Mormont’s
sleeping
cell,
a
man-shape
all
in
black,
cloaked
and
hooded…
but
beneath
the
hood,
its
eyes
shone
with
an
icy
blue
radiance…

Ghost
leapt.
Man
and
wolf
went
down
together
with
neither
scream
nor
snarl,
rolling,
smashing
into
a
chair,
knocking
over
a
table
laden
with
papers.
Mormont’s
raven
was
flapping
overhead,
screaming,
“Corn,
corn,
corn,
corn.”
Jon
felt
as
blind
as
Maester
Aemon.
Keeping
the
wall
to
his
back,
he
slid
toward
the
window
and
ripped
down
the
curtain.
Moonlight
flooded
the
solar.
He
glimpsed
black
hands
buried
in
white
fur,
swollen
dark
fingers
tightening
around
his
direwolf’s
throat.
Ghost
was
twisting
and
snapping,
legs
flailing
in
the
air,
but
he
could
not
break
free.

Jon
had
no
time
to
be
afraid.
He
threw
himself
forward,
shouting,
bringing
down
the
longsword
with
all
his
weight
behind
it.
Steel
sheared
through
sleeve
and
skin
and
bone,
yet
the
sound
was
wrong
somehow.
The
smell
that
engulfed
him
was
so
queer
and
cold
he
almost
gagged.
He
saw
arm
and
hand
on
the
floor,
black
fingers
wriggling
in
a
pool
of
moonlight.
Ghost
wrenched
free
of
the
other
hand
and
crept
away,
red
tongue
lolling
from
his
mouth.

The
hooded
man
lifted
his
pale
moon
face,
and
Jon
slashed
at
it
without
hesitation.
The
sword
laid
the
intruder
open
to
the
bone,
taking
off
half
his
nose
and
opening
a
gash
cheek
to
cheek
under
those
eyes,
eyes,
eyes
like
blue
stars
burning.
Jon
knew
that
face.
Othor,
he
thought,
reeling
back.
Gods,
he’s
dead,
he’s
dead,
I
saw
him
dead.

He
felt
something
scrabble
at
his
ankle.
Black
fingers
clawed
at
his
calf.
The
arm
was
crawling
up
his
leg,
ripping
at
wool
and
flesh.
Shouting
with
revulsion,
Jon
pried
the
fingers
off
his
leg
with
the
point
of
his
sword
and
flipped
the
thing
away.
It
lay
writhing,
fingers
opening
and
closing.

The
corpse
lurched
forward.
There
was
no
blood.
One-armed,
face
cut
near
in
half,
it
seemed
to
feel
nothing.
Jon
held
the
longsword
before
him.
“Stay
away!”
he
commanded,
his
voice
gone
shrill.
“Corn,”
screamed
the
raven,
“corn,
corn.”
The
severed
arm
was
wriggling
out
of
its
torn
sleeve,
a
pale
snake
with
a
black
five-fingered
head.
Ghost
pounced
and
got
it
between
his
teeth.
Finger
bones
crunched.
Jon
hacked
at
the
corpse’s
neck,
felt
the
steel
bite
deep
and
hard.

Dead
Othor
slammed
into
him,
knocking
him
off
his
feet.

Jon’s
breath
went
out
of
him
as
the
fallen
table
caught
him
between
his
shoulder
blades.
The
sword,
where
was
the
sword?
He’d
lost
the
damned
sword!
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
scream,
the
wight
jammed
its
black
corpse
fingers
into
Jon’s
mouth.
Gagging,
he
tried
to
shove
it
off,
but
the
dead
man
was
too
heavy.
Its
hand
forced
itself
farther
down
his
throat,
icy
cold,
choking
him.
Its
face
was
against
his
own,
filling
the
world.
Frost
covered
its
eyes,
sparkling
blue.
Jon
raked
cold
flesh
with
his
nails
and
kicked
at
the
thing’s
legs.
He
tried
to
bite,
tried
to
punch,
tried
to
breathe…

And
suddenly
the
corpse’s
weight
was
gone,
its
fingers
ripped
from
his
throat.
It
was
all
Jon
could
do
to
roll
over,
retching
and
shaking.

Ghost
had
it
again.
He
watched
as
the
direwolf
buried
his
teeth
in
the
wight’s
gut
and
began
to
rip
and
tear.
He
watched,
only
half
conscious,
for
a
long
moment
before
he
finally
remembered
to
look
for
his
sword…

…
and
saw
Lord
Mormont,
naked
and
groggy
from
sleep,
standing
in
the
doorway
with
an
oil
lamp
in
hand.
Gnawed
and
fingerless,
the
arm
thrashed
on
the
floor,
wriggling
toward
him.

Jon
tried
to
shout,
but
his
voice
was
gone.
Staggering
to
his
feet,
he
kicked
the
arm
away
and
snatched
the
lamp
from
the
Old
Bear’s
fingers.
The
flame
flickered
and
almost
died.
“Burn!”
the
raven
cawed.
“Burn,
burn,
burn!”

Spinning,
Jon
saw
the
drapes
he’d
ripped
from
the
window.
He
flung
the
lamp
into
the
puddled
cloth
with
both
hands.
Metal
crunched,
glass
shattered,
oil
spewed,
and
the
hangings
went
up
in
a
great
whoosh
of
flame.
The
heat
of
it
on
his
face
was
sweeter
than
any
kiss
Jon
had
ever
known.
“Ghost!”
he
shouted.

The
direwolf
wrenched
free
and
came
to
him
as
the
wight
struggled
to
rise,
dark
snakes
spilling
from
the
great
wound
in
its
belly.
Jon
plunged
his
hand
into
the
flames,
grabbed
a
fistful
of
the
burning
drapes,
and
whipped
them
at
the
dead
man.
Let
it
burn,
he
prayed
as
the
cloth
smothered
the
corpse,
gods,
please,
please,
let
it
burn.





BRAN

The
Karstarks
came
in
on
a
cold
windy
morning,
bringing
three
hundred
horsemen
and
near
two
thousand
foot
from
their
castle
at
Karhold.
The
steel
points
of
their
pikes
winked
in
the
pale
sunlight
as
the
column
approached.
A
man
went
before
them,
pounding
out
a
slow,
deep-throated
marching
rhythm
on
a
drum
that
was
bigger
than
he
was,
boom,
boom,
boom.

Bran
watched
them
come
from
a
guard
turret
atop
the
outer
wall,
peering
through
Maester
Luwin’s
bronze
far-eye
while
perched
on
Hodor’s
shoulders.
Lord
Rickard
himself
led
them,
his
sons
Harrion
and
Eddard
and
Torrhen
riding
beside
him
beneath
night-black
banners
emblazoned
with
the
white
sunburst
of
their
House.
Old
Nan
said
they
had
Stark
blood
in
them,
going
back
hundreds
of
years,
but
they
did
not
look
like
Starks
to
Bran.
They
were
big
men,
and
fierce,
faces
covered
with
thick
beards,
hair
worn
loose
past
the
shoulders.
Their
cloaks
were
made
of
skins,
the
pelts
of
bear
and
seal
and
wolf.

They
were
the
last,
he
knew.
The
other
lords
were
already
here,
with
their
hosts.
Bran
yearned
to
ride
out
among
them,
to
see
the
winter
houses
full
to
bursting,
the
jostling
crowds
in
the
market
square
every
morning,
the
streets
rutted
and
torn
by
wheel
and
hoof.
But
Robb
had
forbidden
him
to
leave
the
castle.
“We
have
no
men
to
spare
to
guard
you,”
his
brother
had
explained.

“I’ll
take
Summer,”
Bran
argued.

“Don’t
act
the
boy
with
me,
Bran,”
Robb
said.
“You
know
better
than
that.
Only
two
days
ago
one
of
Lord
Bolton’s
men
knifed
one
of
Lord
Cerwyn’s
at
the
Smoking
Log.
Our
lady
mother
would
skin
me
for
a
pelt
if
I
let
you
put
yourself
at
risk.”
He
was
using
the
voice
of
Robb
the
Lord
when
he
said
it;
Bran
knew
that
meant
there
was
no
appeal.

It
was
because
of
what
had
happened
in
the
wolfswood,
he
knew.
The
memory
still
gave
him
bad
dreams.
He
had
been
as
helpless
as
a
baby,
no
more
able
to
defend
himself
than
Rickon
would
have
been.
Less,
even…
Rickon
would
have
kicked
them,
at
the
least.
It
shamed
him.
He
was
only
a
few
years
younger
than
Robb;
if
his
brother
was
almost
a
man
grown,
so
was
he.
He
should
have
been
able
to
protect
himself.

A
year
ago,
before,
he
would
have
visited
the
town
even
if
it
meant
climbing
over
the
walls
by
himself.
In
those
days
he
could
run
down
stairs,
get
on
and
off
his
pony
by
himself,
and
wield
a
wooden
sword
good
enough
to
knock
Prince
Tommen
in
the
dirt.
Now
he
could
only
watch,
peering
out
through
Maester
Luwin’s
lens
tube.
The
maester
had
taught
him
all
the
banners:
the
mailed
fist
of
the
Glovers,
silver
on
scarlet;
Lady
Mormont’s
black
bear;
the
hideous
flayed
man
that
went
before
Roose
Bolton
of
the
Dreadfort;
a
bull
moose
for
the
Hornwoods;
a
battle-axe
for
the
Cerwyns;
three
sentinel
trees
for
the
Tallharts;
and
the
fearsome
sigil
of
House
Umber,
a
roaring
giant
in
shattered
chains.

And
soon
enough
he
learned
the
faces
too,
when
the
lords
and
their
sons
and
knights
retainer
came
to
Winterfell
to
feast.
Even
the
Great
Hall
was
not
large
enough
to
seat
all
of
them
at
once,
so
Robb
hosted
each
of
the
principal
bannermen
in
turn.
Bran
was
always
given
the
place
of
honor
at
his
brother’s
right
hand.
Some
of
the
lords
bannermen
gave
him
queer
hard
stares
as
he
sat
there,
as
if
they
wondered
by
what
right
a
green
boy
should
be
placed
above
them,
and
him
a
cripple
too.

“How
many
is
it
now?”
Bran
asked
Maester
Luwin
as
Lord
Karstark
and
his
sons
rode
through
the
gates
in
the
outer
wall.

“Twelve
thousand
men,
or
near
enough
as
makes
no
matter.”

“How
many
knights?”

“Few
enough,”
the
maester
said
with
a
touch
of
impatience.
“To
be
a
knight,
you
must
stand
your
vigil
in
a
sept,
and
be
anointed
with
the
seven
oils
to
consecrate
your
vows.
In
the
north,
only
a
few
of
the
great
houses
worship
the
Seven.
The
rest
honor
the
old
gods,
and
name
no
knights…
but
those
lords
and
their
sons
and
sworn
swords
are
no
less
fierce
or
loyal
or
honorable.
A
man’s
worth
is
not
marked
by
a
ser
before
his
name.
As
I
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
before.”

“Still,”
said
Bran,
“how
many
knights?”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“Three
hundred,
perhaps
four…
among
three
thousand
armored
lances
who
are
not
knights.”

“Lord
Karstark
is
the
last,”
Bran
said
thoughtfully.
“Robb
will
feast
him
tonight.”

“No
doubt
he
will.”

“How
long
before…
before
they
go?”

“He
must
march
soon,
or
not
at
all,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“The
winter
town
is
full
to
bursting,
and
this
army
of
his
will
eat
the
countryside
clean
if
it
camps
here
much
longer.
Others
are
waiting
to
join
him
all
along
the
kingsroad,
barrow
knights
and
crannogmen
and
the
Lords
Manderly
and
Flint.
The
fighting
has
begun
in
the
riverlands,
and
your
brother
has
many
leagues
to
go.”

“I
know.”
Bran
felt
as
miserable
as
he
sounded.
He
handed
the
bronze
tube
back
to
the
maester,
and
noticed
how
thin
Luwin’s
hair
had
grown
on
top.
He
could
see
the
pink
of
scalp
showing
through.
It
felt
queer
to
look
down
on
him
this
way,
when
he’d
spent
his
whole
life
looking
up
at
him,
but
when
you
sat
on
Hodor’s
back
you
looked
down
on
everyone.
“I
don’t
want
to
watch
anymore.
Hodor,
take
me
back
to
the
keep.”

“Hodor,”
said
Hodor.

Maester
Luwin
tucked
the
tube
up
his
sleeve.
“Bran,
your
lord
brother
will
not
have
time
to
see
you
now.
He
must
greet
Lord
Karstark
and
his
sons
and
make
them
welcome.”

“I
won’t
trouble
Robb.
I
want
to
visit
the
godswood.”
He
put
his
hand
on
Hodor’s
shoulder.
“Hodor.”

A
series
of
chisel-cut
handholds
made
a
ladder
in
the
granite
of
the
tower’s
inner
wall.
Hodor
hummed
tunelessly
as
he
went
down
hand
under
hand,
Bran
bouncing
against
his
back
in
the
wicker
seat
that
Maester
Luwin
had
fashioned
for
him.
Luwin
had
gotten
the
idea
from
the
baskets
the
women
used
to
carry
firewood
on
their
backs;
after
that
it
had
been
a
simple
matter
of
cutting
legholes
and
attaching
some
new
straps
to
spread
Bran’s
weight
more
evenly.
It
was
not
as
good
as
riding
Dancer,
but
there
were
places
Dancer
could
not
go,
and
this
did
not
shame
Bran
the
way
it
did
when
Hodor
carried
him
in
his
arms
like
a
baby.
Hodor
seemed
to
like
it
too,
though
with
Hodor
it
was
hard
to
tell.
The
only
tricky
part
was
doors.
Sometimes
Hodor
forgot
that
he
had
Bran
on
his
back,
and
that
could
be
painful
when
he
went
through
a
door.

For
near
a
fortnight
there
had
been
so
many
comings
and
goings
that
Robb
ordered
both
portcullises
kept
up
and
the
drawbridge
down
between
them,
even
in
the
dead
of
night.
A
long
column
of
armored
lancers
was
crossing
the
moat
between
the
walls
when
Bran
emerged
from
the
tower;
Karstark
men,
following
their
lords
into
the
castle.
They
wore
black
iron
halfhelms
and
black
woolen
cloaks
patterned
with
the
white
sunburst.
Hodor
trotted
along
beside
them,
smiling
to
himself,
his
boots
thudding
against
the
wood
of
the
drawbridge.
The
riders
gave
them
queer
looks
as
they
went
by,
and
once
Bran
heard
someone
guffaw.
He
refused
to
let
it
trouble
him.
“Men
will
look
at
you,”
Maester
Luwin
had
warned
him
the
first
time
they
had
strapped
the
wicker
basket
around
Hodor’s
chest.
“They
will
look,
and
they
will
talk,
and
some
will
mock
you.”
Let
them
mock,
Bran
thought.
No
one
mocked
him
in
his
bedchamber,
but
he
would
not
live
his
life
in
bed.

As
they
passed
beneath
the
gatehouse
portcullis,
Bran
put
two
fingers
into
his
mouth
and
whistled.
Summer
came
loping
across
the
yard.
Suddenly
the
Karstark
lancers
were
fighting
for
control,
as
their
horses
rolled
their
eyes
and
whickered
in
dismay.
One
stallion
reared,
screaming,
his
rider
cursing
and
hanging
on
desperately.
The
scent
of
the
direwolves
sent
horses
into
a
frenzy
of
fear
if
they
were
not
accustomed
to
it,
but
they’d
quiet
soon
enough
once
Summer
was
gone.
“The
godswood,”
Bran
reminded
Hodor.

Even
Winterfell
itself
was
crowded.
The
yard
rang
to
the
sound
of
sword
and
axe,
the
rumble
of
wagons,
and
the
barking
of
dogs.
The
armory
doors
were
open,
and
Bran
glimpsed
Mikken
at
his
forge,
his
hammer
ringing
as
sweat
dripped
off
his
bare
chest.
Bran
had
never
seen
as
many
strangers
in
all
his
years,
not
even
when
King
Robert
had
come
to
visit
Father.

He
tried
not
to
flinch
as
Hodor
ducked
through
a
low
door.
They
walked
down
a
long
dim
hallway,
Summer
padding
easily
beside
them.
The
wolf
glanced
up
from
time
to
time,
eyes
smoldering
like
liquid
gold.
Bran
would
have
liked
to
touch
him,
but
he
was
riding
too
high
for
his
hand
to
reach.

The
godswood
was
an
island
of
peace
in
the
sea
of
chaos
that
Winterfell
had
become.
Hodor
made
his
way
through
the
dense
stands
of
oak
and
ironwood
and
sentinels,
to
the
still
pool
beside
the
heart
tree.
He
stopped
under
the
gnarled
limbs
of
the
weirwood,
humming.
Bran
reached
up
over
his
head
and
pulled
himself
out
of
his
seat,
drawing
the
dead
weight
of
his
legs
up
through
the
holes
in
the
wicker
basket.
He
hung
for
a
moment,
dangling,
the
dark
red
leaves
brushing
against
his
face,
until
Hodor
lifted
him
and
lowered
him
to
the
smooth
stone
beside
the
water.
“I
want
to
be
by
myself
for
a
while,”
he
said.
“You
go
soak.
Go
to
the
pools.”

“Hodor.”
Hodor
stomped
through
the
trees
and
vanished.
Across
the
godswood,
beneath
the
windows
of
the
Guest
House,
an
underground
hot
spring
fed
three
small
ponds.
Steam
rose
from
the
water
day
and
night,
and
the
wall
that
loomed
above
was
thick
with
moss.
Hodor
hated
cold
water,
and
would
fight
like
a
treed
wildcat
when
threatened
with
soap,
but
he
would
happily
immerse
himself
in
the
hottest
pool
and
sit
for
hours,
giving
a
loud
burp
to
echo
the
spring
whenever
a
bubble
rose
from
the
murky
green
depths
to
break
upon
the
surface.

Summer
lapped
at
the
water
and
settled
down
at
Bran’s
side.
He
rubbed
the
wolf
under
the
jaw,
and
for
a
moment
boy
and
beast
both
felt
at
peace.
Bran
had
always
liked
the
godswood,
even
before,
but
of
late
he
found
himself
drawn
to
it
more
and
more.
Even
the
heart
tree
no
longer
scared
him
the
way
it
used
to.
The
deep
red
eyes
carved
into
the
pale
trunk
still
watched
him,
yet
somehow
he
took
comfort
from
that
now.
The
gods
were
looking
over
him,
he
told
himself;
the
old
gods,
gods
of
the
Starks
and
the
First
Men
and
the
children
of
the
forest,
his
father’s
gods.
He
felt
safe
in
their
sight,
and
the
deep
silence
of
the
trees
helped
him
think.
Bran
had
been
thinking
a
lot
since
his
fall;
thinking,
and
dreaming,
and
talking
with
the
gods.

“Please
make
it
so
Robb
won’t
go
away,”
he
prayed
softly.
He
moved
his
hand
through
the
cold
water,
sending
ripples
across
the
pool.
“Please
make
him
stay.
Or
if
he
has
to
go,
bring
him
home
safe,
with
Mother
and
Father
and
the
girls.
And
make
it…
make
it
so
Rickon
understands.”

His
baby
brother
had
been
wild
as
a
winter
storm
since
he
learned
Robb
was
riding
off
to
war,
weeping
and
angry
by
turns.
He’d
refused
to
eat,
cried
and
screamed
for
most
of
a
night,
even
punched
Old
Nan
when
she
tried
to
sing
him
to
sleep,
and
the
next
day
he’d
vanished.
Robb
had
set
half
the
castle
searching
for
him,
and
when
at
last
they’d
found
him
down
in
the
crypts,
Rickon
had
slashed
at
them
with
a
rusted
iron
sword
he’d
snatched
from
a
dead
king’s
hand,
and
Shaggydog
had
come
slavering
out
of
the
darkness
like
a
green-eyed
demon.
The
wolf
was
near
as
wild
as
Rickon;
he’d
bitten
Gage
on
the
arm
and
torn
a
chunk
of
flesh
from
Mikken’s
thigh.
It
had
taken
Robb
himself
and
Grey
Wind
to
bring
him
to
bay.
Farlen
had
the
black
wolf
chained
up
in
the
kennels
now,
and
Rickon
cried
all
the
more
for
being
without
him.

Maester
Luwin
counseled
Robb
to
remain
at
Winterfell,
and
Bran
pleaded
with
him
too,
for
his
own
sake
as
much
as
Rickon’s,
but
his
brother
only
shook
his
head
stubbornly
and
said,
“I
don’t
want
to
go.
I
have
to.”

It
was
only
half
a
lie.
Someone
had
to
go,
to
hold
the
Neck
and
help
the
Tullys
against
the
Lannisters,
Bran
could
understand
that,
but
it
did
not
have
to
be
Robb.
His
brother
might
have
given
the
command
to
Hal
Mollen
or
Theon
Greyjoy,
or
to
one
of
his
lords
bannermen.
Maester
Luwin
urged
him
to
do
just
that,
but
Robb
would
not
hear
of
it.
“My
lord
father
would
never
have
sent
men
off
to
die
while
he
huddled
like
a
craven
behind
the
walls
of
Winterfell,”
he
said,
all
Robb
the
Lord.

Robb
seemed
half
a
stranger
to
Bran
now,
transformed,
a
lord
in
truth,
though
he
had
not
yet
seen
his
sixteenth
name
day.
Even
their
father’s
bannermen
seemed
to
sense
it.
Many
tried
to
test
him,
each
in
his
own
way.
Roose
Bolton
and
Robett
Glover
both
demanded
the
honor
of
battle
command,
the
first
brusquely,
the
second
with
a
smile
and
a
jest.
Stout,
grey-haired
Maege
Mormont,
dressed
in
mail
like
a
man,
told
Robb
bluntly
that
he
was
young
enough
to
be
her
grandson,
and
had
no
business
giving
her
commands…
but
as
it
happened,
she
had
a
granddaughter
she
would
be
willing
to
have
him
marry.
Soft-spoken
Lord
Cerwyn
had
actually
brought
his
daughter
with
him,
a
plump,
homely
maid
of
thirty
years
who
sat
at
her
father’s
left
hand
and
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
plate.
Jovial
Lord
Hornwood
had
no
daughters,
but
he
did
bring
gifts,
a
horse
one
day,
a
haunch
of
venison
the
next,
a
silver-chased
hunting
horn
the
day
after,
and
he
asked
nothing
in
return…
nothing
but
a
certain
holdfast
taken
from
his
grandfather,
and
hunting
rights
north
of
a
certain
ridge,
and
leave
to
dam
the
White
Knife,
if
it
please
the
lord.

Robb
answered
each
of
them
with
cool
courtesy,
much
as
Father
might
have,
and
somehow
he
bent
them
to
his
will.

And
when
Lord
Umber,
who
was
called
the
Greatjon
by
his
men
and
stood
as
tall
as
Hodor
and
twice
as
wide,
threatened
to
take
his
forces
home
if
he
was
placed
behind
the
Hornwoods
or
the
Cerwyns
in
the
order
of
march,
Robb
told
him
he
was
welcome
to
do
so.
“And
when
we
are
done
with
the
Lannisters,”
he
promised,
scratching
Grey
Wind
behind
the
ear,
“we
will
march
back
north,
root
you
out
of
your
keep,
and
hang
you
for
an
oathbreaker.”
Cursing,
the
Greatjon
flung
a
flagon
of
ale
into
the
fire
and
bellowed
that
Robb
was
so
green
he
must
piss
grass.
When
Hallis
Mollen
moved
to
restrain
him,
he
knocked
him
to
the
floor,
kicked
over
a
table,
and
unsheathed
the
biggest,
ugliest
greatsword
that
Bran
had
ever
seen.
All
along
the
benches,
his
sons
and
brothers
and
sworn
swords
leapt
to
their
feet,
grabbing
for
their
steel.

Yet
Robb
only
said
a
quiet
word,
and
in
a
snarl
and
the
blink
of
an
eye
Lord
Umber
was
on
his
back,
his
sword
spinning
on
the
floor
three
feet
away
and
his
hand
dripping
blood
where
Grey
Wind
had
bitten
off
two
fingers.
“My
lord
father
taught
me
that
it
was
death
to
bare
steel
against
your
liege
lord,”
Robb
said,
“but
doubtless
you
only
meant
to
cut
my
meat.”
Bran’s
bowels
went
to
water
as
the
Greatjon
struggled
to
rise,
sucking
at
the
red
stumps
of
fingers…
but
then,
astonishingly,
the
huge
man
laughed.
“Your
meat,”
he
roared,
“is
bloody
tough.”

And
somehow
after
that
the
Greatjon
became
Robb’s
right
hand,
his
staunchest
champion,
loudly
telling
all
and
sundry
that
the
boy
lord
was
a
Stark
after
all,
and
they’d
damn
well
better
bend
their
knees
if
they
didn’t
fancy
having
them
chewed
off.

Yet
that
very
night,
his
brother
came
to
Bran’s
bedchamber
pale
and
shaken,
after
the
fires
had
burned
low
in
the
Great
Hall.
“I
thought
he
was
going
to
kill
me,”
Robb
confessed.
“Did
you
see
the
way
he
threw
down
Hal,
like
he
was
no
bigger
than
Rickon?
Gods,
I
was
so
scared.
And
the
Greatjon’s
not
the
worst
of
them,
only
the
loudest.
Lord
Roose
never
says
a
word,
he
only
looks
at
me,
and
all
I
can
think
of
is
that
room
they
have
in
the
Dreadfort,
where
the
Boltons
hang
the
skins
of
their
enemies.”

“That’s
just
one
of
Old
Nan’s
stories,”
Bran
said.
A
note
of
doubt
crept
into
his
voice.
“Isn’t
it?”

“I
don’t
know.”
He
gave
a
weary
shake
of
his
head.
“Lord
Cerwyn
means
to
take
his
daughter
south
with
us.
To
cook
for
him,
he
says.
Theon
is
certain
I’ll
find
the
girl
in
my
bedroll
one
night.
I
wish…
I
wish
Father
was
here…”

That
was
the
one
thing
they
could
agree
on,
Bran
and
Rickon
and
Robb
the
Lord;
they
all
wished
Father
was
here.
But
Lord
Eddard
was
a
thousand
leagues
away,
a
captive
in
some
dungeon,
a
hunted
fugitive
running
for
his
life,
or
even
dead.
No
one
seemed
to
know
for
certain;
every
traveler
told
a
different
tale,
each
more
terrifying
than
the
last.
The
heads
of
Father’s
guardsmen
were
rotting
on
the
walls
of
the
Red
Keep,
impaled
on
spikes.
King
Robert
was
dead
at
Father’s
hands.
The
Baratheons
had
laid
siege
to
King’s
Landing.
Lord
Eddard
had
fled
south
with
the
king’s
wicked
brother
Renly.
Arya
and
Sansa
had
been
murdered
by
the
Hound.
Mother
had
killed
Tyrion
the
Imp
and
hung
his
body
from
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
was
marching
on
the
Eyrie,
burning
and
slaughtering
as
he
went.
One
wine-sodden
taleteller
even
claimed
that
Rhaegar
Targaryen
had
returned
from
the
dead
and
was
marshaling
a
vast
host
of
ancient
heroes
on
Dragonstone
to
reclaim
his
father’s
throne.

When
the
raven
came,
bearing
a
letter
marked
with
Father’s
own
seal
and
written
in
Sansa’s
hand,
the
cruel
truth
seemed
no
less
incredible.
Bran
would
never
forget
the
look
on
Robb’s
face
as
he
stared
at
their
sister’s
words.
“She
says
Father
conspired
at
treason
with
the
king’s
brothers,”
he
read.
“King
Robert
is
dead,
and
Mother
and
I
are
summoned
to
the
Red
Keep
to
swear
fealty
to
Joffrey.
She
says
we
must
be
loyal,
and
when
she
marries
Joffrey
she
will
plead
with
him
to
spare
our
lord
father’s
life.”
His
fingers
closed
into
a
fist,
crushing
Sansa’s
letter
between
them.
“And
she
says
nothing
of
Arya,
nothing,
not
so
much
as
a
word.
Damn
her!
What’s
wrong
with
the
girl?”

Bran
felt
all
cold
inside.
“She
lost
her
wolf,”
he
said,
weakly,
remembering
the
day
when
four
of
his
father’s
guardsmen
had
returned
from
the
south
with
Lady’s
bones.
Summer
and
Grey
Wind
and
Shaggydog
had
begun
to
howl
before
they
crossed
the
drawbridge,
in
voices
drawn
and
desolate.
Beneath
the
shadow
of
the
First
Keep
was
an
ancient
lichyard,
its
headstones
spotted
with
pale
lichen,
where
the
old
Kings
of
Winter
had
laid
their
faithful
servants.
It
was
there
they
buried
Lady,
while
her
brothers
stalked
between
the
graves
like
restless
shadows.
She
had
gone
south,
and
only
her
bones
had
returned.

Their
grandfather,
old
Lord
Rickard,
had
gone
as
well,
with
his
son
Brandon
who
was
Father’s
brother,
and
two
hundred
of
his
best
men.
None
had
ever
returned.
And
Father
had
gone
south,
with
Arya
and
Sansa,
and
Jory
and
Hullen
and
Fat
Tom
and
the
rest,
and
later
Mother
and
Ser
Rodrik
had
gone,
and
they
hadn’t
come
back
either.
And
now
Robb
meant
to
go.
Not
to
King’s
Landing
and
not
to
swear
fealty,
but
to
Riverrun,
with
a
sword
in
his
hand.
And
if
their
lord
father
were
truly
a
prisoner,
that
could
mean
his
death
for
a
certainty.
It
frightened
Bran
more
than
he
could
say.

“If
Robb
has
to
go,
watch
over
him,”
Bran
entreated
the
old
gods,
as
they
watched
him
with
the
heart
tree’s
red
eyes,
“and
watch
over
his
men,
Hal
and
Quent
and
the
rest,
and
Lord
Umber
and
Lady
Mormont
and
the
other
lords.
And
Theon
too,
I
suppose.
Watch
them
and
keep
them
safe,
if
it
please
you,
gods.
Help
them
defeat
the
Lannisters
and
save
Father
and
bring
them
home.”

A
faint
wind
sighed
through
the
godswood
and
the
red
leaves
stirred
and
whispered.
Summer
bared
his
teeth.
“You
hear
them,
boy?”
a
voice
asked.

Bran
lifted
his
head.
Osha
stood
across
the
pool,
beneath
an
ancient
oak,
her
face
shadowed
by
leaves.
Even
in
irons,
the
wildling
moved
quiet
as
a
cat.
Summer
circled
the
pool,
sniffed
at
her.
The
tall
woman
flinched.

“Summer,
to
me,”
Bran
called.
The
direwolf
took
one
final
sniff,
spun,
and
bounded
back.
Bran
wrapped
his
arms
around
him.
“What
are
you
doing
here?”
He
had
not
seen
Osha
since
they’d
taken
her
captive
in
the
wolfswood,
though
he
knew
she’d
been
set
to
working
in
the
kitchens.

“They
are
my
gods
too,”
Osha
said.
“Beyond
the
Wall,
they
are
the
only
gods.”
Her
hair
was
growing
out,
brown
and
shaggy.
It
made
her
look
more
womanly,
that
and
the
simple
dress
of
brown
roughspun
they’d
given
her
when
they
took
her
mail
and
leather.
“Gage
lets
me
have
my
prayers
from
time
to
time,
when
I
feel
the
need,
and
I
let
him
do
as
he
likes
under
my
skirt,
when
he
feels
the
need.
It’s
nothing
to
me.
I
like
the
smell
of
flour
on
his
hands,
and
he’s
gentler
than
Stiv.”
She
gave
an
awkward
bow.
“I’ll
leave
you.
There’s
pots
that
want
scouring.”

“No,
stay,”
Bran
commanded
her.
“Tell
me
what
you
meant,
about
hearing
the
gods.”

Osha
studied
him.
“You
asked
them
and
they’re
answering.
Open
your
ears,
listen,
you’ll
hear.”

Bran
listened.
“It’s
only
the
wind,”
he
said
after
a
moment,
uncertain.
“The
leaves
are
rustling.”

“Who
do
you
think
sends
the
wind,
if
not
the
gods?”
She
seated
herself
across
the
pool
from
him,
clinking
faintly
as
she
moved.
Mikken
had
fixed
iron
manacles
to
her
ankles,
with
a
heavy
chain
between
them;
she
could
walk,
so
long
as
she
kept
her
strides
small,
but
there
was
no
way
for
her
to
run,
or
climb,
or
mount
a
horse.
“They
see
you,
boy.
They
hear
you
talking.
That
rustling,
that’s
them
talking
back.”

“What
are
they
saying?”

“They’re
sad.
Your
lord
brother
will
get
no
help
from
them,
not
where
he’s
going.
The
old
gods
have
no
power
in
the
south.
The
weirwoods
there
were
all
cut
down,
thousands
of
years
ago.
How
can
they
watch
your
brother
when
they
have
no
eyes?”

Bran
had
not
thought
of
that.
It
frightened
him.
If
even
the
gods
could
not
help
his
brother,
what
hope
was
there?
Maybe
Osha
wasn’t
hearing
them
right.
He
cocked
his
head
and
tried
to
listen
again.
He
thought
he
could
hear
the
sadness
now,
but
nothing
more
than
that.

The
rustling
grew
louder.
Bran
heard
muffled
footfalls
and
a
low
humming,
and
Hodor
came
blundering
out
of
the
trees,
naked
and
smiling.
“Hodor!”

“He
must
have
heard
our
voices,”
Bran
said.
“Hodor,
you
forgot
your
clothes.”

“Hodor,”
Hodor
agreed.
He
was
dripping
wet
from
the
neck
down,
steaming
in
the
chill
air.
His
body
was
covered
with
brown
hair,
thick
as
a
pelt.
Between
his
legs,
his
manhood
swung
long
and
heavy.

Osha
eyed
him
with
a
sour
smile.
“Now
there’s
a
big
man,”
she
said.
“He
has
giant’s
blood
in
him,
or
I’m
the
queen.”

“Maester
Luwin
says
there
are
no
more
giants.
He
says
they’re
all
dead,
like
the
children
of
the
forest.
All
that’s
left
of
them
are
old
bones
in
the
earth
that
men
turn
up
with
plows
from
time
to
time.”

“Let
Maester
Luwin
ride
beyond
the
Wall,”
Osha
said.
“He’ll
find
giants
then,
or
they’ll
find
him.
My
brother
killed
one.
Ten
foot
tall
she
was,
and
stunted
at
that.
They’ve
been
known
to
grow
big
as
twelve
and
thirteen
feet.
Fierce
things
they
are
too,
all
hair
and
teeth,
and
the
wives
have
beards
like
their
husbands,
so
there’s
no
telling
them
apart.
The
women
take
human
men
for
lovers,
and
it’s
from
them
the
half
bloods
come.
It
goes
harder
on
the
women
they
catch.
The
men
are
so
big
they’ll
rip
a
maid
apart
before
they
get
her
with
child.”
She
grinned
at
him.
“But
you
don’t
know
what
I
mean,
do
you,
boy?”

“Yes
I
do,”
Bran
insisted.
He
understood
about
mating;
he
had
seen
dogs
in
the
yard,
and
watched
a
stallion
mount
a
mare.
But
talking
about
it
made
him
uncomfortable.
He
looked
at
Hodor.
“Go
back
and
bring
your
clothes,
Hodor,”
he
said.
“Go
dress.”

“Hodor.”
He
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come,
ducking
under
a
low-hanging
tree
limb.

He
was
awfully
big,
Bran
thought
as
he
watched
him
go.
“Are
there
truly
giants
beyond
the
Wall?”
he
asked
Osha,
uncertainly.

“Giants
and
worse
than
giants,
Lordling.
I
tried
to
tell
your
brother
when
he
asked
his
questions,
him
and
your
maester
and
that
smiley
boy
Greyjoy.
The
cold
winds
are
rising,
and
men
go
out
from
their
fires
and
never
come
back…
or
if
they
do,
they’re
not
men
no
more,
but
only
wights,
with
blue
eyes
and
cold
black
hands.
Why
do
you
think
I
run
south
with
Stiv
and
Hali
and
the
rest
of
them
fools?
Mance
thinks
he’ll
fight,
the
brave
sweet
stubborn
man,
like
the
white
walkers
were
no
more
than
rangers,
but
what
does
he
know?
He
can
call
himself
King-beyond-the-Wall
all
he
likes,
but
he’s
still
just
another
old
black
crow
who
flew
down
from
the
Shadow
Tower.
He’s
never
tasted
winter.
I
was
born
up
there,
child,
like
my
mother
and
her
mother
before
her
and
her
mother
before
her,
born
of
the
Free
Folk.
We
remember.”
Osha
stood,
her
chains
rattling
together.
“I
tried
to
tell
your
lordling
brother.
Only
yesterday,
when
I
saw
him
in
the
yard.
‘M’lord
Stark,’
I
called
to
him,
respectful
as
you
please,
but
he
looked
through
me,
and
that
sweaty
oaf
Greatjon
Umber
shoves
me
out
of
the
path.
So
be
it.
I’ll
wear
my
irons
and
hold
my
tongue.
A
man
who
won’t
listen
can’t
hear.”

“Tell
me.
Robb
will
listen
to
me,
I
know
he
will.”

“Will
he
now?
We’ll
see.
You
tell
him
this,
m’lord.
You
tell
him
he’s
bound
on
marching
the
wrong
way.
It’s
north
he
should
be
taking
his
swords.
North,
not
south.
You
hear
me?”

Bran
nodded.
“I’ll
tell
him.”

But
that
night,
when
they
feasted
in
the
Great
Hall,
Robb
was
not
with
them.
He
took
his
meal
in
the
solar
instead,
with
Lord
Rickard
and
the
Greatjon
and
the
other
lords
bannermen,
to
make
the
final
plans
for
the
long
march
to
come.
It
was
left
to
Bran
to
fill
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
table,
and
act
the
host
to
Lord
Karstark’s
sons
and
honored
friends.
They
were
already
at
their
places
when
Hodor
carried
Bran
into
the
hall
on
his
back,
and
knelt
beside
the
high
seat.
Two
of
the
serving
men
helped
lift
him
from
his
basket.
Bran
could
feel
the
eyes
of
every
stranger
in
the
hall.
It
had
grown
quiet.
“My
lords,”
Hallis
Mollen
announced,
“Brandon
Stark,
of
Winterfell.”

“I
welcome
you
to
our
fires,”
Bran
said
stiffly,
“and
offer
you
meat
and
mead
in
honor
of
our
friendship.”

Harrion
Karstark,
the
oldest
of
Lord
Rickard’s
sons,
bowed,
and
his
brothers
after
him,
yet
as
they
settled
back
in
their
places
he
heard
the
younger
two
talking
in
low
voices,
over
the
clatter
of
wine
cups.
“…sooner
die
than
live
like
that,”
muttered
one,
his
father’s
namesake
Eddard,
and
his
brother
Torrhen
said
likely
the
boy
was
broken
inside
as
well
as
out,
too
craven
to
take
his
own
life.

Broken,
Bran
thought
bitterly
as
he
clutched
his
knife.
Is
that
what
he
was
now?
Bran
the
Broken?
“I
don’t
want
to
be
broken,”
he
whispered
fiercely
to
Maester
Luwin,
who’d
been
seated
to
his
right.
“I
want
to
be
a
knight.”

“There
are
some
who
call
my
order
the
knights
of
the
mind,”
Luwin
replied.
“You
are
a
surpassing
clever
boy
when
you
work
at
it,
Bran.
Have
you
ever
thought
that
you
might
wear
a
maester’s
chain?
There
is
no
limit
to
what
you
might
learn.”

“I
want
to
learn
magic,”
Bran
told
him.
“The
crow
promised
that
I
would
fly.”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“I
can
teach
you
history,
healing,
herblore.
I
can
teach
you
the
speech
of
ravens,
and
how
to
build
a
castle,
and
the
way
a
sailor
steers
his
ship
by
the
stars.
I
can
teach
you
to
measure
the
days
and
mark
the
seasons,
and
at
the
Citadel
in
Oldtown
they
can
teach
you
a
thousand
things
more.
But,
Bran,
no
man
can
teach
you
magic.”

“The
children
could,”
Bran
said.
“The
children
of
the
forest.”
That
reminded
him
of
the
promise
he
had
made
to
Osha
in
the
godswood,
so
he
told
Luwin
what
she
had
said.

The
maester
listened
politely.
“The
wildling
woman
could
give
Old
Nan
lessons
in
telling
tales,
I
think,”
he
said
when
Bran
was
done.
“I
will
talk
with
her
again
if
you
like,
but
it
would
be
best
if
you
did
not
trouble
your
brother
with
this
folly.
He
has
more
than
enough
to
concern
him
without
fretting
over
giants
and
dead
men
in
the
woods.
It’s
the
Lannisters
who
hold
your
lord
father,
Bran,
not
the
children
of
the
forest.”
He
put
a
gentle
hand
on
Bran’s
arm.
“Think
on
what
I
said,
child.”

And
two
days
later,
as
a
red
dawn
broke
across
a
windswept
sky,
Bran
found
himself
in
the
yard
beneath
the
gatehouse,
strapped
atop
Dancer
as
he
said
his
farewells
to
his
brother.

“You
are
the
lord
in
Winterfell
now,”
Robb
told
him.
He
was
mounted
on
a
shaggy
grey
stallion,
his
shield
hung
from
the
horse’s
side;
wood
banded
with
iron,
white
and
grey,
and
on
it
the
snarling
face
of
a
direwolf.
His
brother
wore
grey
chainmail
over
bleached
leathers,
sword
and
dagger
at
his
waist,
a
fur-trimmed
cloak
across
his
shoulders.
“You
must
take
my
place,
as
I
took
Father’s,
until
we
come
home.”

“I
know,”
Bran
replied
miserably.
He
had
never
felt
so
little
or
alone
or
scared.
He
did
not
know
how
to
be
a
lord.

“Listen
to
Maester
Luwin’s
counsel,
and
take
care
of
Rickon.
Tell
him
that
I’ll
be
back
as
soon
as
the
fighting
is
done.”

Rickon
had
refused
to
come
down.
He
was
up
in
his
chamber,
redeyed
and
defiant.
“No!”
he’d
screamed
when
Bran
had
asked
if
he
didn’t
want
to
say
farewell
to
Robb.
“NO
farewell!”

“I
told
him,”
Bran
said.
“He
says
no
one
ever
comes
back.”

“He
can’t
be
a
baby
forever.
He’s
a
Stark,
and
near
four.”
Robb
sighed.
“Well,
Mother
will
be
home
soon.
And
I’ll
bring
back
Father,
I
promise.”

He
wheeled
his
courser
around
and
trotted
away.
Grey
Wind
followed,
loping
beside
the
warhorse,
lean
and
swift.
Hallis
Mollen
went
before
them
through
the
gate,
carrying
the
rippling
white
banner
of
House
Stark
atop
a
high
standard
of
grey
ash.
Theon
Greyjoy
and
the
Greatjon
fell
in
on
either
side
of
Robb,
and
their
knights
formed
up
in
a
double
column
behind
them,
steel-tipped
lances
glinting
in
the
sun.

Uncomfortably,
he
remembered
Osha’s
words.
He’s
marching
the
wrong
way,
he
thought.
For
an
instant
he
wanted
to
gallop
after
him
and
shout
a
warning,
but
when
Robb
vanished
beneath
the
portcullis,
the
moment
was
gone.

Beyond
the
castle
walls,
a
roar
of
sound
went
up.
The
foot
soldiers
and
townsfolk
were
cheering
Robb
as
he
rode
past,
Bran
knew;
cheering
for
Lord
Stark,
for
the
Lord
of
Winterfell
on
his
great
stallion,
with
his
cloak
streaming
and
Grey
Wind
racing
beside
him.
They
would
never
cheer
for
him
that
way,
he
realized
with
a
dull
ache.
He
might
be
the
lord
in
Winterfell
while
his
brother
and
father
were
gone,
but
he
was
still
Bran
the
Broken.
He
could
not
even
get
off
his
own
horse,
except
to
fall.

When
the
distant
cheers
had
faded
to
silence
and
the
yard
was
empty
at
last,
Winterfell
seemed
deserted
and
dead.
Bran
looked
around
at
the
faces
of
those
who
remained,
women
and
children
and
old
men…
and
Hodor.
The
huge
stableboy
had
a
lost
and
frightened
look
to
his
face.
“Hodor?”
he
said
sadly.

“Hodor,”
Bran
agreed,
wondering
what
it
meant.





DAENERYS

When
he
had
taken
his
pleasure,
Khal
Drogo
rose
from
their
sleeping
mats
to
tower
above
her.
His
skin
shone
dark
as
bronze
in
the
ruddy
light
from
the
brazier,
the
faint
lines
of
old
scars
visible
on
his
broad
chest.
Ink-black
hair,
loose
and
unbound,
cascaded
over
his
shoulders
and
down
his
back,
well
past
his
waist.
His
manhood
glistened
wetly.
The
khal’s
mouth
twisted
in
a
frown
beneath
the
droop
of
his
long
mustachio.
“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
has
no
need
of
iron
chairs.”

Dany
propped
herself
on
an
elbow
to
look
up
at
him,
so
tall
and
magnificent.
She
loved
his
hair
especially.
It
had
never
been
cut;
he
had
never
known
defeat.
“It
was
prophesied
that
the
stallion
will
ride
to
the
ends
of
the
earth,”
she
said.

“The
earth
ends
at
the
black
salt
sea,”
Drogo
answered
at
once.
He
wet
a
cloth
in
a
basin
of
warm
water
to
wipe
the
sweat
and
oil
from
his
skin.
“No
horse
can
cross
the
poison
water.”

“In
the
Free
Cities,
there
are
ships
by
the
thousand,”
Dany
told
him,
as
she
had
told
him
before.
“Wooden
horses
with
a
hundred
legs,
that
fly
across
the
sea
on
wings
full
of
wind.”

Khal
Drogo
did
not
want
to
hear
it.
“We
will
speak
no
more
of
wooden
horses
and
iron
chairs.”
He
dropped
the
cloth
and
began
to
dress.
“This
day
I
will
go
to
the
grass
and
hunt,
woman
wife,”
he
announced
as
he
shrugged
into
a
painted
vest
and
buckled
on
a
wide
belt
with
heavy
medallions
of
silver,
gold,
and
bronze.

“Yes,
my
sun-and-stars,”
Dany
said.
Drogo
would
take
his
bloodriders
and
ride
in
search
of
hrakkar,
the
great
white
lion
of
the
plains.
If
they
returned
triumphant,
her
lord
husband’s
joy
would
be
fierce,
and
he
might
be
willing
to
hear
her
out.

Savage
beasts
he
did
not
fear,
nor
any
man
who
had
ever
drawn
breath,
but
the
sea
was
a
different
matter.
To
the
Dothraki,
water
that
a
horse
could
not
drink
was
something
foul;
the
heaving
grey-green
plains
of
the
ocean
filled
them
with
superstitious
loathing.
Drogo
was
a
bolder
man
than
the
other
horselords
in
half
a
hundred
ways,
she
had
found…
but
not
in
this.
If
only
she
could
get
him
onto
a
ship…

After
the
khal
and
his
bloodriders
had
ridden
off
with
their
bows,
Dany
summoned
her
handmaids.
Her
body
felt
so
fat
and
ungainly
now
that
she
welcomed
the
help
of
their
strong
arms
and
deft
hands,
whereas
before
she
had
often
been
uncomfortable
with
the
way
they
fussed
and
fluttered
about
her.
They
scrubbed
her
clean
and
dressed
her
in
sandsilk,
loose
and
flowing.
As
Doreah
combed
out
her
hair,
she
sent
Jhiqui
to
find
Ser
Jorah
Mormont.

The
knight
came
at
once.
He
wore
horsehair
leggings
and
painted
vest,
like
a
rider.
Coarse
black
hair
covered
his
thick
chest
and
muscular
arms.
“My
princess.
How
may
I
serve
you?”

“You
must
talk
to
my
lord
husband,”
Dany
said.
“Drogo
says
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
will
have
all
the
lands
of
the
earth
to
rule,
and
no
need
to
cross
the
poison
water.
He
talks
of
leading
his
khalasar
east
after
Rhaego
is
born,
to
plunder
the
lands
around
the
Jade
Sea.”

The
knight
looked
thoughtful.
“The
khal
has
never
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms,”
he
said.
“They
are
nothing
to
him.
If
he
thinks
of
them
at
all,
no
doubt
he
thinks
of
islands,
a
few
small
cities
clinging
to
rocks
in
the
manner
of
Lorath
or
Lys,
surrounded
by
stormy
seas.
The
riches
of
the
east
must
seem
a
more
tempting
prospect.”

“But
he
must
ride
west,”
Dany
said,
despairing.
“Please,
help
me
make
him
understand.”
She
had
never
seen
the
Seven
Kingdoms
either,
no
more
than
Drogo,
yet
she
felt
as
though
she
knew
them
from
all
the
tales
her
brother
had
told
her.
Viserys
had
promised
her
a
thousand
times
that
he
would
take
her
back
one
day,
but
he
was
dead
now
and
his
promises
had
died
with
him.

“The
Dothraki
do
things
in
their
own
time,
for
their
own
reasons,”
the
knight
answered.
“Have
patience,
Princess.
Do
not
make
your
brother’s
mistake.
We
will
go
home,
I
promise
you.”

Home?
The
word
made
her
feel
sad.
Ser
Jorah
had
his
Bear
Island,
but
what
was
home
to
her?
A
few
tales,
names
recited
as
solemnly
as
the
words
of
a
prayer,
the
fading
memory
of
a
red
door…
was
Vaes
Dothrak
to
be
her
home
forever?
When
she
looked
at
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen,
was
she
looking
at
her
future?

Ser
Jorah
must
have
seen
the
sadness
on
her
face.
“A
great
caravan
arrived
during
the
night,
Khaleesi.
Four
hundred
horses,
from
Pentos
by
way
of
Norvos
and
Qohor,
under
the
command
of
Merchant
Captain
Byan
Votyris.
Illyrio
may
have
sent
a
letter.
Would
you
care
to
visit
the
Western
Market?”

Dany
stirred.
“Yes,”
she
said.
“I
would
like
that.”
The
markets
came
alive
when
a
caravan
had
come
in.
You
could
never
tell
what
treasures
the
traders
might
bring
this
time,
and
it
would
be
good
to
hear
men
speaking
Valyrian
again,
as
they
did
in
the
Free
Cities.
“Irri,
have
them
prepare
a
litter.”

“I
shall
tell
your
khas,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
withdrawing.

If
Khal
Drogo
had
been
with
her,
Dany
would
have
ridden
her
silver.
Among
the
Dothraki,
mothers
stayed
on
horseback
almost
up
to
the
moment
of
birth,
and
she
did
not
want
to
seem
weak
in
her
husband’s
eyes.
But
with
the
khal
off
hunting,
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
back
on
soft
cushions
and
be
carried
across
Vaes
Dothrak,
with
red
silk
curtains
to
shield
her
from
the
sun.
Ser
Jorah
saddled
up
and
rode
beside
her,
with
the
four
young
men
of
her
khas
and
her
handmaids.

The
day
was
warm
and
cloudless,
the
sky
a
deep
blue.
When
the
wind
blew,
she
could
smell
the
rich
scents
of
grass
and
earth.
As
her
litter
passed
beneath
the
stolen
monuments,
she
went
from
sunlight
to
shadow
and
back
again.
Dany
swayed
along,
studying
the
faces
of
dead
heroes
and
forgotten
kings.
She
wondered
if
the
gods
of
burned
cities
could
still
answer
prayers.

If
I
were
not
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
thought
wistfully,
this
could
be
my
home.
She
was
khaleesi,
she
had
a
strong
man
and
a
swift
horse,
handmaids
to
serve
her,
warriors
to
keep
her
safe,
an
honored
place
in
the
dosh
khaleen
awaiting
her
when
she
grew
old…
and
in
her
womb
grew
a
son
who
would
one
day
bestride
the
world.
That
should
be
enough
for
any
woman…
but
not
for
the
dragon.
With
Viserys
gone,
Daenerys
was
the
last,
the
very
last.
She
was
the
seed
of
kings
and
conquerors,
and
so
too
the
child
inside
her.
She
must
not
forget.

The
Western
Market
was
a
great
square
of
beaten
earth
surrounded
by
warrens
of
mud-baked
brick,
animal
pens,
whitewashed
drinking
halls.
Hummocks
rose
from
the
ground
like
the
backs
of
great
subterranean
beasts
breaking
the
surface,
yawning
black
mouths
leading
down
to
cool
and
cavernous
storerooms
below.
The
interior
of
the
square
was
a
maze
of
stalls
and
crookback
aisles,
shaded
by
awnings
of
woven
grass.

A
hundred
merchants
and
traders
were
unloading
their
goods
and
setting
up
in
stalls
when
they
arrived,
yet
even
so
the
great
market
seemed
hushed
and
deserted
compared
to
the
teeming
bazaars
that
Dany
remembered
from
Pentos
and
the
other
Free
Cities.
The
caravans
made
their
way
to
Vaes
Dothrak
from
east
and
west
not
so
much
to
sell
to
the
Dothraki
as
to
trade
with
each
other,
Ser
Jorah
had
explained.
The
riders
let
them
come
and
go
unmolested,
so
long
as
they
observed
the
peace
of
the
sacred
city,
did
not
profane
the
Mother
of
Mountains
or
the
Womb
of
the
World,
and
honored
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen
with
the
traditional
gifts
of
salt,
silver,
and
seed.
The
Dothraki
did
not
truly
comprehend
this
business
of
buying
and
selling.

Dany
liked
the
strangeness
of
the
Eastern
Market
too,
with
all
its
queer
sights
and
sounds
and
smells.
She
often
spent
her
mornings
there,
nibbling
tree
eggs,
locust
pie,
and
green
noodles,
listening
to
the
high
ululating
voices
of
the
spellsingers,
gaping
at
manticores
in
silver
cages
and
immense
grey
elephants
and
the
striped
black-and-white
horses
of
the
Jogos
Nhai.
She
enjoyed
watching
all
the
people
too:
dark
solemn
Asshai’i
and
tall
pale
Qartheen,
the
bright-eyed
men
of
Yi
Ti
in
monkey-tail
hats,
warrior
maids
from
Bayasabhad,
Shamyriana,
and
Kayakayanaya
with
iron
rings
in
their
nipples
and
rubies
in
their
cheeks,
even
the
dour
and
frightening
Shadow
Men,
who
covered
their
arms
and
legs
and
chests
with
tattoos
and
hid
their
faces
behind
masks.
The
Eastern
Market
was
a
place
of
wonder
and
magic
for
Dany.

But
the
Western
Market
smelled
of
home.

As
Irri
and
Jhiqui
helped
her
from
her
litter,
she
sniffed,
and
recognized
the
sharp
odors
of
garlic
and
pepper,
scents
that
reminded
Dany
of
days
long
gone
in
the
alleys
of
Tyrosh
and
Myr
and
brought
a
fond
smile
to
her
face.
Under
that
she
smelled
the
heady
sweet
perfumes
of
Lys.
She
saw
slaves
carrying
bolts
of
intricate
Myrish
lace
and
fine
wools
in
a
dozen
rich
colors.
Caravan
guards
wandered
among
the
aisles
in
copper
helmets
and
knee-length
tunics
of
quilted
yellow
cotton,
empty
scabbards
swinging
from
their
woven
leather
belts.
Behind
one
stall
an
armorer
displayed
steel
breastplates
worked
with
gold
and
silver
in
ornate
patterns,
and
helms
hammered
in
the
shapes
of
fanciful
beasts.
Next
to
him
was
a
pretty
young
woman
selling
Lannisport
goldwork,
rings
and
brooches
and
torcs
and
exquisitely
wrought
medallions
suitable
for
belting.
A
huge
eunuch
guarded
her
stall,
mute
and
hairless,
dressed
in
sweat-stained
velvets
and
scowling
at
anyone
who
came
close.
Across
the
aisle,
a
fat
cloth
trader
from
Yi
Ti
was
haggling
with
a
Pentoshi
over
the
price
of
some
green
dye,
the
monkey
tail
on
his
hat
swaying
back
and
forth
as
he
shook
his
head.

“When
I
was
a
little
girl,
I
loved
to
play
in
the
bazaar,”
Dany
told
Ser
Jorah
as
they
wandered
down
the
shady
aisle
between
the
stalls.
“It
was
so
alive
there,
all
the
people
shouting
and
laughing,
so
many
wonderful
things
to
look
at…
though
we
seldom
had
enough
coin
to
buy
anything…
well,
except
for
a
sausage
now
and
again,
or
honeyfingers…
do
they
have
honeyfingers
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
the
kind
they
bake
in
Tyrosh?”

“Cakes,
are
they?
I
could
not
say,
Princess.”
The
knight
bowed.
“If
you
would
pardon
me
for
a
time,
I
will
seek
out
the
captain
and
see
if
he
has
letters
for
us.”

“Very
well.
I’ll
help
you
find
him.”

“There
is
no
need
for
you
to
trouble
yourself.”
Ser
Jorah
glanced
away
impatiently.
“Enjoy
the
market.
I
will
rejoin
you
when
my
business
is
concluded.”

Curious,
Dany
thought
as
she
watched
him
stride
off
through
the
throngs.
She
didn’t
see
why
she
should
not
go
with
him.
Perhaps
Ser
Jorah
meant
to
find
a
woman
after
he
met
with
the
merchant
captain.
Whores
frequently
traveled
with
the
caravans,
she
knew,
and
some
men
were
queerly
shy
about
their
couplings.
She
gave
a
shrug.
“Come,”
she
told
the
others.

Her
handmaids
trailed
along
as
Dany
resumed
her
stroll
through
the
market.
“Oh,
look,”
she
exclaimed
to
Doreah,
“those
are
the
kind
of
sausages
I
meant.”
She
pointed
to
a
stall
where
a
wizened
little
woman
was
grilling
meat
and
onions
on
a
hot
firestone.
“They
make
them
with
lots
of
garlic
and
hot
peppers.”
Delighted
with
her
discovery,
Dany
insisted
the
others
join
her
for
a
sausage.
Her
handmaids
wolfed
theirs
down
giggling
and
grinning,
though
the
men
of
her
khas
sniffed
at
the
grilled
meat
suspiciously.
“They
taste
different
than
I
remember,”
Dany
said
after
her
first
few
bites.

“In
Pentos,
I
make
them
with
pork,”
the
old
woman
said,
“but
all
my
pigs
died
on
the
Dothraki
sea.
These
are
made
of
horsemeat,
Khaleesi,
but
I
spice
them
the
same.”

“Oh.”
Dany
felt
disappointed,
but
Quaro
liked
his
sausage
so
well
he
decided
to
have
another
one,
and
Rakharo
had
to
outdo
him
and
eat
three
more,
belching
loudly.
Dany
giggled.

“You
have
not
laughed
since
your
brother
the
Khal
Rhaggat
was
crowned
by
Drogo,”
said
Irri.
“It
is
good
to
see,
Khaleesi.”

Dany
smiled
shyly.
It
was
sweet
to
laugh.
She
felt
half
a
girl
again.

They
wandered
for
half
the
morning.
She
saw
a
beautiful
feathered
cloak
from
the
Summer
Isles,
and
took
it
for
a
gift.
In
return,
she
gave
the
merchant
a
silver
medallion
from
her
belt.
That
was
how
it
was
done
among
the
Dothraki.
A
birdseller
taught
a
green-and-red
parrot
to
say
her
name,
and
Dany
laughed
again,
yet
still
refused
to
take
him.
What
would
she
do
with
a
green-and-red
parrot
in
a
khalasar?
She
did
take
a
dozen
flasks
of
scented
oils,
the
perfumes
of
her
childhood;
she
had
only
to
close
her
eyes
and
sniff
them
and
she
could
see
the
big
house
with
the
red
door
once
more.
When
Doreah
looked
longingly
at
a
fertility
charm
at
a
magician’s
booth,
Dany
took
that
too
and
gave
it
to
the
handmaid,
thinking
that
now
she
should
find
something
for
Irri
and
Jhiqui
as
well.

Turning
a
corner,
they
came
upon
a
wine
merchant
offering
thimble-sized
cups
of
his
wares
to
the
passersby.
“Sweet
reds,”
he
cried
in
fluent
Dothraki,
“I
have
sweet
reds,
from
Lys
and
Volantis
and
the
Arbor.
Whites
from
Lys,
Tyroshi
pear
brandy,
firewine,
pepperwine,
the
pale
green
nectars
of
Myr.
Smokeberry
browns
and
Andalish
sours,
I
have
them,
I
have
them.”
He
was
a
small
man,
slender
and
handsome,
his
flaxen
hair
curled
and
perfumed
after
the
fashion
of
Lys.
When
Dany
paused
before
his
stall,
he
bowed
low.
“A
taste
for
the
khaleesi?
I
have
a
sweet
red
from
Dorne,
my
lady,
it
sings
of
plums
and
cherries
and
rich
dark
oak.
A
cask,
a
cup,
a
swallow?
One
taste,
and
you
will
name
your
child
after
me.”

Dany
smiled.
“My
son
has
his
name,
but
I
will
try
your
summerwine,”
she
said
in
Valyrian,
Valyrian
as
they
spoke
it
in
the
Free
Cities.
The
words
felt
strange
on
her
tongue,
after
so
long.
“Just
a
taste,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”

The
merchant
must
have
taken
her
for
Dothraki,
with
her
clothes
and
her
oiled
hair
and
sun-browned
skin.
When
she
spoke,
he
gaped
at
her
in
astonishment.
“My
lady,
you
are…
Tyroshi?
Can
it
be
so?”

“My
speech
may
be
Tyroshi,
and
my
garb
Dothraki,
but
I
am
of
Westeros,
of
the
Sunset
Kingdoms,”
Dany
told
him.

Doreah
stepped
up
beside
her.
“You
have
the
honor
to
address
Daenerys
of
the
House
Targaryen,
Daenerys
Stormborn,
khaleesi
of
the
riding
men
and
princess
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.”

The
wine
merchant
dropped
to
his
knees.
“Princess,”
he
said,
bowing
his
head.

“Rise,”
Dany
commanded
him.
“I
would
still
like
to
taste
that
summerwine
you
spoke
of.”

The
man
bounded
to
his
feet.
“That?
Dornish
swill.
It
is
not
worthy
of
a
princess.
I
have
a
dry
red
from
the
Arbor,
crisp
and
delectable.
Please,
let
me
give
you
a
cask.”

Khal
Drogo’s
visits
to
the
Free
Cities
had
given
him
a
taste
for
good
wine,
and
Dany
knew
that
such
a
noble
vintage
would
please
him.
“You
honor
me,
ser,”
she
murmured
sweetly.

“The
honor
is
mine.”
The
merchant
rummaged
about
in
the
back
of
his
stall
and
produced
a
small
oaken
cask.
Burned
into
the
wood
was
a
cluster
of
grapes.
“The
Redwyne
sigil,”
he
said,
pointing,
“for
the
Arbor.
There
is
no
finer
drink.”

“Khal
Drogo
and
I
will
share
it
together.
Aggo,
take
this
back
to
my
litter,
if
you’d
be
so
kind.”
The
wineseller
beamed
as
the
Dothraki
hefted
the
cask.

She
did
not
realize
that
Ser
Jorah
had
returned
until
she
heard
the
knight
say,
“No.”
His
voice
was
strange,
brusque.
“Aggo,
put
down
that
cask.”

Aggo
looked
at
Dany.
She
gave
a
hesitant
nod.
“Ser
Jorah,
is
something
wrong?”

“I
have
a
thirst.
Open
it,
wineseller.”

The
merchant
frowned.
“The
wine
is
for
the
khaleesi,
not
for
the
likes
of
you,
ser.”

Ser
Jorah
moved
closer
to
the
stall.
“If
you
don’t
open
it,
I’ll
crack
it
open
with
your
head.”
He
carried
no
weapons
here
in
the
sacred
city,
save
his
hands—yet
his
hands
were
enough,
big,
hard,
dangerous,
his
knuckles
covered
with
coarse
dark
hairs.
The
wineseller
hesitated
a
moment,
then
took
up
his
hammer
and
knocked
the
plug
from
the
cask.

“Pour,”
Ser
Jorah
commanded.
The
four
young
warriors
of
Dany’s
khas
arrayed
themselves
behind
him,
frowning,
watching
with
their
dark,
almond-shaped
eyes.

“It
would
be
a
crime
to
drink
this
rich
a
wine
without
letting
it
breathe.”
The
wineseller
had
not
put
his
hammer
down.

Jhogo
reached
for
the
whip
coiled
at
his
belt,
but
Dany
stopped
him
with
a
light
touch
on
the
arm.
“Do
as
Ser
Jorah
says,”
she
said.
People
were
stopping
to
watch.

The
man
gave
her
a
quick,
sullen
glance.
“As
the
princess
commands.”
He
had
to
set
aside
his
hammer
to
lift
the
cask.
He
filled
two
thimble-sized
tasting
cups,
pouring
so
deftly
he
did
not
spill
a
drop.

Ser
Jorah
lifted
a
cup
and
sniffed
at
the
wine,
frowning.

“Sweet,
isn’t
it?”
the
wineseller
said,
smiling.
“Can
you
smell
the
fruit,
ser?
The
perfume
of
the
Arbor.
Taste
it,
my
lord,
and
tell
me
it
isn’t
the
finest,
richest
wine
that’s
ever
touched
your
tongue.”

Ser
Jorah
offered
him
the
cup.
“You
taste
it
first.”

“Me?”
The
man
laughed.
“I
am
not
worthy
of
this
vintage,
my
lord.
And
it’s
a
poor
wine
merchant
who
drinks
up
his
own
wares.”
His
smile
was
amiable,
yet
she
could
see
the
sheen
of
sweat
on
his
brow.

“You
will
drink,”
Dany
said,
cold
as
ice.
“Empty
the
cup,
or
I
will
tell
them
to
hold
you
down
while
Ser
Jorah
pours
the
whole
cask
down
your
throat.”

The
wineseller
shrugged,
reached
for
the
cup…
and
grabbed
the
cask
instead,
flinging
it
at
her
with
both
hands.
Ser
Jorah
bulled
into
her,
knocking
her
out
of
the
way.
The
cask
bounced
off
his
shoulder
and
smashed
open
on
the
ground.
Dany
stumbled
and
lost
her
feet.
“No,”
she
screamed,
thrusting
her
hands
out
to
break
her
fall…
and
Doreah
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
wrenched
her
backward,
so
she
landed
on
her
legs
and
not
her
belly.

The
trader
vaulted
over
the
stall,
darting
between
Aggo
and
Rakharo.
Quaro
reached
for
an
arakh
that
was
not
there
as
the
blond
man
slammed
him
aside.
He
raced
down
the
aisle.
Dany
heard
the
snap
of
Jhogo’s
whip,
saw
the
leather
lick
out
and
coil
around
the
wineseller’s
leg.
The
man
sprawled
face
first
in
the
dirt.

A
dozen
caravan
guards
had
come
running.
With
them
was
the
master
himself,
Merchant
Captain
Byan
Votyris,
a
diminutive
Norvoshi
with
skin
like
old
leather
and
a
bristling
blue
mustachio
that
swept
up
to
his
ears.
He
seemed
to
know
what
had
happened
without
a
word
being
spoken.
“Take
this
one
away
to
await
the
pleasure
of
the
khal,”
he
commanded,
gesturing
at
the
man
on
the
ground.
Two
guards
hauled
the
wineseller
to
his
feet.
“His
goods
I
gift
to
you
as
well,
Princess,”
the
merchant
captain
went
on.
“Small
token
of
regret,
that
one
of
mine
would
do
this
thing.”

Doreah
and
Jhiqui
helped
Dany
back
to
her
feet.
The
poisoned
wine
was
leaking
from
the
broken
cask
into
the
dirt.
“How
did
you
know?”
she
asked
Ser
Jorah,
trembling.
“How?”

“I
did
not
know,
Khaleesi,
not
until
the
man
refused
to
drink,
but
once
I
read
Magister
Illyrio’s
letter,
I
feared.”
His
dark
eyes
swept
over
the
faces
of
the
strangers
in
the
market.
“Come.
Best
not
to
talk
of
it
here.”

Dany
was
near
tears
as
they
carried
her
back.
The
taste
in
her
mouth
was
one
she
had
known
before:
fear.
For
years
she
had
lived
in
terror
of
Viserys,
afraid
of
waking
the
dragon.
This
was
even
worse.
It
was
not
just
for
herself
that
she
feared
now,
but
for
her
baby.
He
must
have
sensed
her
fright,
for
he
moved
restlessly
inside
her.
Dany
stroked
the
swell
of
her
belly
gently,
wishing
she
could
reach
him,
touch
him,
soothe
him.
“You
are
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
little
one,”
she
whispered
as
her
litter
swayed
along,
curtains
drawn
tight.
“You
are
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
and
the
dragon
does
not
fear.”

Under
the
hollow
hummock
of
earth
that
was
her
home
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
Dany
ordered
them
to
leave
her—all
but
Ser
Jorah.
“Tell
me,”
she
commanded
as
she
lowered
herself
onto
her
cushions.
“Was
it
the
Usurper?”

“Yes.”
The
knight
drew
out
a
folded
parchment.
“A
letter
to
Viserys,
from
Magister
Illyrio.
Robert
Baratheon
offers
lands
and
lordships
for
your
death,
or
your
brother’s.”

“My
brother?”
Her
sob
was
half
a
laugh.
“He
does
not
know
yet,
does
he?
The
Usurper
owes
Drogo
a
lordship.”
This
time
her
laugh
was
half
a
sob.
She
hugged
herself
protectively.
“And
me,
you
said.
Only
me?”

“You
and
the
child,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
grim.

“No.
He
cannot
have
my
son.”
She
would
not
weep,
she
decided.
She
would
not
shiver
with
fear.
The
Usurper
has
woken
the
dragon
now,
she
told
herself…
and
her
eyes
went
to
the
dragon’s
eggs
resting
in
their
nest
of
dark
velvet.
The
shifting
lamplight
limned
their
stony
scales,
and
shimmering
motes
of
jade
and
scarlet
and
gold
swam
in
the
air
around
them,
like
courtiers
around
a
king.

Was
it
madness
that
seized
her
then,
born
of
fear?
Or
some
strange
wisdom
buried
in
her
blood?
Dany
could
not
have
said.
She
heard
her
own
voice
saying,
“Ser
Jorah,
light
the
brazier.”

“Khaleesi?”
The
knight
looked
at
her
strangely.
“It
is
so
hot.
Are
you
certain?”

She
had
never
been
so
certain.
“Yes.
I…
I
have
a
chill.
Light
the
brazier.”

He
bowed.
“As
you
command.”

When
the
coals
were
afire,
Dany
sent
Ser
Jorah
from
her.
She
had
to
be
alone
to
do
what
she
must
do.
This
is
madness,
she
told
herself
as
she
lifted
the
black-and-scarlet
egg
from
the
velvet.
It
will
only
crack
and
burn,
and
it’s
so
beautiful,
Ser
Jorah
will
call
me
a
fool
if
I
ruin
it,
and
yet,
and
yet…

Cradling
the
egg
with
both
hands,
she
carried
it
to
the
fire
and
pushed
it
down
amongst
the
burning
coals.
The
black
scales
seemed
to
glow
as
they
drank
the
heat.
Flames
licked
against
the
stone
with
small
red
tongues.
Dany
placed
the
other
two
eggs
beside
the
black
one
in
the
fire.
As
she
stepped
back
from
the
brazier,
the
breath
trembled
in
her
throat.

She
watched
until
the
coals
had
turned
to
ashes.
Drifting
sparks
floated
up
and
out
of
the
smokehole.
Heat
shimmered
in
waves
around
the
dragon’s
eggs.
And
that
was
all.

Your
brother
Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,
Ser
Jorah
had
said.
Dany
gazed
at
her
eggs
sadly.
What
had
she
expected?
A
thousand
thousand
years
ago
they
had
been
alive,
but
now
they
were
only
pretty
rocks.
They
could
not
make
a
dragon.
A
dragon
was
air
and
fire.
Living
flesh,
not
dead
stone.

The
brazier
was
cold
again
by
the
time
Khal
Drogo
returned.
Cohollo
was
leading
a
packhorse
behind
him,
with
the
carcass
of
a
great
white
lion
slung
across
its
back.
Above,
the
stars
were
coming
out.
The
khal
laughed
as
he
swung
down
off
his
stallion
and
showed
her
the
scars
on
his
leg
where
the
hrakkar
had
raked
him
through
his
leggings.
“I
shall
make
you
a
cloak
of
its
skin,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
swore.

When
Dany
told
him
what
had
happened
at
the
market,
all
laughter
stopped,
and
Khal
Drogo
grew
very
quiet.

“This
poisoner
was
the
first,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
warned
him,
“but
he
will
not
be
the
last.
Men
will
risk
much
for
a
lordship.”

Drogo
was
silent
for
a
time.
Finally
he
said,
“This
seller
of
poisons
ran
from
the
moon
of
my
life.
Better
he
should
run
after
her.
So
he
will.
Jhogo,
Jorah
the
Andal,
to
each
of
you
I
say,
choose
any
horse
you
wish
from
my
herds,
and
it
is
yours.
Any
horse
save
my
red
and
the
silver
that
was
my
bride
gift
to
the
moon
of
my
life.
I
make
this
gift
to
you
for
what
you
did.

“And
to
Rhaego
son
of
Drogo,
the
stallion
who
will
mount
the
world,
to
him
I
also
pledge
a
gift.
To
him
I
will
give
this
iron
chair
his
mother’s
father
sat
in.
I
will
give
him
Seven
Kingdoms.
I,
Drogo,
khal,
will
do
this
thing.”
His
voice
rose,
and
he
lifted
his
fist
to
the
sky.
“I
will
take
my
khalasar
west
to
where
the
world
ends,
and
ride
the
wooden
horses
across
the
black
salt
water
as
no
khal
has
done
before.
I
will
kill
the
men
in
the
iron
suits
and
tear
down
their
stone
houses.
I
will
rape
their
women,
take
their
children
as
slaves,
and
bring
their
broken
gods
back
to
Vaes
Dothrak
to
bow
down
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains.
This
I
vow,
I,
Drogo
son
of
Bharbo.
This
I
swear
before
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
as
the
stars
look
down
in
witness.”

His
khalasar
left
Vaes
Dothrak
two
days
later,
striking
south
and
west
across
the
plains.
Khal
Drogo
led
them
on
his
great
red
stallion,
with
Daenerys
beside
him
on
her
silver.
The
wineseller
hurried
behind
them,
naked,
on
foot,
chained
at
throat
and
wrists.
His
chains
were
fastened
to
the
halter
of
Dany’s
silver.
As
she
rode,
he
ran
after
her,
barefoot
and
stumbling.
No
harm
would
come
to
him…
so
long
as
he
kept
up.





CATELYN

It
was
too
far
to
make
out
the
banners
clearly,
but
even
through
the
drifting
fog
she
could
see
that
they
were
white,
with
a
dark
smudge
in
their
center
that
could
only
be
the
direwolf
of
Stark,
grey
upon
its
icy
field.
When
she
saw
it
with
her
own
eyes,
Catelyn
reined
up
her
horse
and
bowed
her
head
in
thanks.
The
gods
were
good.
She
was
not
too
late.

“They
await
our
coming,
my
lady,”
Ser
Wylis
Manderly
said,
“as
my
lord
father
swore
they
would.”

“Let
us
not
keep
them
waiting
any
longer,
ser.”
Ser
Brynden
Tully
put
the
spurs
to
his
horse
and
trotted
briskly
toward
the
banners.
Catelyn
rode
beside
him.

Ser
Wylis
and
his
brother
Ser
Wendel
followed,
leading
their
levies,
near
fifteen
hundred
men:
some
twenty-odd
knights
and
as
many
squires,
two
hundred
mounted
lances,
swordsmen,
and
freeriders,
and
the
rest
foot,
armed
with
spears,
pikes
and
tridents.
Lord
Wyman
had
remained
behind
to
see
to
the
defenses
of
White
Harbor.
A
man
of
near
sixty
years,
he
had
grown
too
stout
to
sit
a
horse.
“If
I
had
thought
to
see
war
again
in
my
lifetime,
I
should
have
eaten
a
few
less
eels,”
he’d
told
Catelyn
when
he
met
her
ship,
slapping
his
massive
belly
with
both
hands.
His
fingers
were
fat
as
sausages.
“My
boys
will
see
you
safe
to
your
son,
though,
have
no
fear.”

His
“boys”
were
both
older
than
Catelyn,
and
she
might
have
wished
that
they
did
not
take
after
their
father
quite
so
closely.
Ser
Wylis
was
only
a
few
eels
short
of
not
being
able
to
mount
his
own
horse;
she
pitied
the
poor
animal.
Ser
Wendel,
the
younger
boy,
would
have
been
the
fattest
man
she’d
ever
known,
had
she
only
neglected
to
meet
his
father
and
brother.
Wylis
was
quiet
and
formal,
Wendel
loud
and
boisterous;
both
had
ostentatious
walrus
mustaches
and
heads
as
bare
as
a
baby’s
bottom;
neither
seemed
to
own
a
single
garment
that
was
not
spotted
with
food
stains.
Yet
she
liked
them
well
enough;
they
had
gotten
her
to
Robb,
as
their
father
had
vowed,
and
nothing
else
mattered.

She
was
pleased
to
see
that
her
son
had
sent
eyes
out,
even
to
the
east.
The
Lannisters
would
come
from
the
south
when
they
came,
but
it
was
good
that
Robb
was
being
careful.
My
son
is
leading
a
host
to
war,
she
thought,
still
only
half
believing
it.
She
was
desperately
afraid
for
him,
and
for
Winterfell,
yet
she
could
not
deny
feeling
a
certain
pride
as
well.
A
year
ago
he
had
been
a
boy.
What
was
he
now?
she
wondered.

Outriders
spied
the
Manderly
banners—the
white
merman
with
trident
in
hand,
rising
from
a
blue-green
sea—and
hailed
them
warmly.
They
were
led
to
a
spot
of
high
ground
dry
enough
for
a
camp.
Ser
Wylis
called
a
halt
there,
and
remained
behind
with
his
men
to
see
the
fires
laid
and
the
horses
tended,
while
his
brother
Wendel
rode
on
with
Catelyn
and
her
uncle
to
present
their
father’s
respects
to
their
liege
lord.

The
ground
under
their
horses’
hooves
was
soft
and
wet.
It
fell
away
slowly
beneath
them
as
they
rode
past
smoky
peat
fires,
lines
of
horses,
and
wagons
heavy-laden
with
hardbread
and
salt
beef.
On
a
stony
outcrop
of
land
higher
than
the
surrounding
country,
they
passed
a
lord’s
pavilion
with
walls
of
heavy
sailcloth.
Catelyn
recognized
the
banner,
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods,
brown
on
its
dark
orange
field.

Just
beyond,
through
the
mists,
she
glimpsed
the
walls
and
towers
of
Moat
Cailin…
or
what
remained
of
them.
Immense
blocks
of
black
basalt,
each
as
large
as
a
crofter’s
cottage,
lay
scattered
and
tumbled
like
a
child’s
wooden
blocks,
half-sunk
in
the
soft
boggy
soil.
Nothing
else
remained
of
a
curtain
wall
that
had
once
stood
as
high
as
Winterfell’s.
The
wooden
keep
was
gone
entirely,
rotted
away
a
thousand
years
past,
with
not
so
much
as
a
timber
to
mark
where
it
had
stood.
All
that
was
left
of
the
great
stronghold
of
the
First
Men
were
three
towers…
three
where
there
had
once
been
twenty,
if
the
taletellers
could
be
believed.

The
Gatehouse
Tower
looked
sound
enough,
and
even
boasted
a
few
feet
of
standing
wall
to
either
side
of
it.
The
Drunkard’s
Tower,
off
in
the
bog
where
the
south
and
west
walls
had
once
met,
leaned
like
a
man
about
to
spew
a
bellyful
of
wine
into
the
gutter.
And
the
tall,
slender
Children’s
Tower,
where
legend
said
the
children
of
the
forest
had
once
called
upon
their
nameless
gods
to
send
the
hammer
of
the
waters,
had
lost
half
its
crown.
It
looked
as
if
some
great
beast
had
taken
a
bite
out
of
the
crenellations
along
the
tower
top,
and
spit
the
rubble
across
the
bog.
All
three
towers
were
green
with
moss.
A
tree
was
growing
out
between
the
stones
on
the
north
side
of
the
Gatehouse
Tower,
its
gnarled
limbs
festooned
with
ropy
white
blankets
of
ghostskin.

“Gods
have
mercy,”
Ser
Brynden
exclaimed
when
he
saw
what
lay
before
them.
“This
is
Moat
Cailin?
It’s
no
more
than
a—”

“—death
trap,”
Catelyn
finished.
“I
know
how
it
looks,
Uncle.
I
thought
the
same
the
first
time
I
saw
it,
but
Ned
assured
me
that
this
ruin
is
more
formidable
than
it
seems.
The
three
surviving
towers
command
the
causeway
from
all
sides,
and
any
enemy
must
pass
between
them.
The
bogs
here
are
impenetrable,
full
of
quicksands
and
suckholes
and
teeming
with
snakes.
To
assault
any
of
the
towers,
an
army
would
need
to
wade
through
waist-deep
black
muck,
cross
a
moat
full
of
lizard-lions,
and
scale
walls
slimy
with
moss,
all
the
while
exposing
themselves
to
fire
from
archers
in
the
other
towers.”
She
gave
her
uncle
a
grim
smile.
“And
when
night
falls,
there
are
said
to
be
ghosts,
cold
vengeful
spirits
of
the
north
who
hunger
for
southron
blood.”

Ser
Brynden
chuckled.
“Remind
me
not
to
linger
here.
Last
I
looked,
I
was
southron
myself.”

Standards
had
been
raised
atop
all
three
towers.
The
Karstark
sunburst
hung
from
the
Drunkard’s
Tower,
beneath
the
direwolf;
on
the
Children’s
Tower
it
was
the
Greatjon’s
giant
in
shattered
chains.
But
on
the
Gatehouse
Tower,
the
Stark
banner
flew
alone.
That
was
where
Robb
had
made
his
seat.
Catelyn
made
for
it,
with
Ser
Brynden
and
Ser
Wendel
behind
her,
their
horses
stepping
slowly
down
the
log-and-plank
road
that
had
been
laid
across
the
green-and-black
fields
of
mud.

She
found
her
son
surrounded
by
his
father’s
lords
bannermen,
in
a
drafty
hall
with
a
peat
fire
smoking
in
a
black
hearth.
He
was
seated
at
a
massive
stone
table,
a
pile
of
maps
and
papers
in
front
of
him,
talking
intently
with
Roose
Bolton
and
the
Greatjon.
At
first
he
did
not
notice
her…
but
his
wolf
did.
The
great
grey
beast
was
lying
near
the
fire,
but
when
Catelyn
entered
he
lifted
his
head,
and
his
golden
eyes
met
hers.
The
lords
fell
silent
one
by
one,
and
Robb
looked
up
at
the
sudden
quiet
and
saw
her.
“Mother?”
he
said,
his
voice
thick
with
emotion.

Catelyn
wanted
to
run
to
him,
to
kiss
his
sweet
brow,
to
wrap
him
in
her
arms
and
hold
him
so
tightly
that
he
would
never
come
to
harm…
but
here
in
front
of
his
lords,
she
dared
not.
He
was
playing
a
man’s
part
now,
and
she
would
not
take
that
away
from
him.
So
she
held
herself
at
the
far
end
of
the
basalt
slab
they
were
using
for
a
table.
The
direwolf
got
to
his
feet
and
padded
across
the
room
to
where
she
stood.
It
seemed
bigger
than
a
wolf
ought
to
be.
“You’ve
grown
a
beard,”
she
said
to
Robb,
while
Grey
Wind
sniffed
her
hand.

He
rubbed
his
stubbled
jaw,
suddenly
awkward.
“Yes.”
His
chin
hairs
were
redder
than
the
ones
on
his
head.

“I
like
it.”
Catelyn
stroked
the
wolfs
head,
gently.
“It
makes
you
look
like
my
brother
Edmure.”
Grey
Wind
nipped
at
her
fingers,
playful,
and
trotted
back
to
his
place
by
the
fire.

Ser
Helman
Tallhart
was
the
first
to
follow
the
direwolf
across
the
room
to
pay
his
respects,
kneeling
before
her
and
pressing
his
brow
to
her
hand.
“Lady
Catelyn,”
he
said,
“you
are
fair
as
ever,
a
welcome
sight
in
troubled
times.”
The
Glovers
followed,
Galbart
and
Robett,
and
Greatjon
Umber,
and
the
rest,
one
by
one.
Theon
Greyjoy
was
the
last.
“I
had
not
looked
to
see
you
here,
my
lady,”
he
said
as
he
knelt.

“I
had
not
thought
to
be
here,”
Catelyn
said,
“until
I
came
ashore
at
White
Harbor,
and
Lord
Wyman
told
me
that
Robb
had
called
the
banners.
You
know
his
son,
Ser
Wendel.”
Wendel
Manderly
stepped
forward
and
bowed
as
low
as
his
girth
would
allow.
“And
my
uncle,
Ser
Brynden
Tully,
who
has
left
my
sister’s
service
for
mine.”

“The
Blackfish,”
Robb
said.
“Thank
you
for
joining
us,
ser.
We
need
men
of
your
courage.
And
you,
Ser
Wendel,
I
am
glad
to
have
you
here.
Is
Ser
Rodrik
with
you
as
well,
Mother?
I’ve
missed
him.”

“Ser
Rodrik
is
on
his
way
north
from
White
Harbor.
I
have
named
him
castellan
and
commanded
him
to
hold
Winterfell
till
our
return.
Maester
Luwin
is
a
wise
counsellor,
but
unskilled
in
the
arts
of
war.”

“Have
no
fear
on
that
count,
Lady
Stark,”
the
Greatjon
told
her
in
his
bass
rumble.
“Winterfell
is
safe.
We’ll
shove
our
swords
up
Tywin
Lannister’s
bunghole
soon
enough,
begging
your
pardons,
and
then
it’s
on
to
the
Red
Keep
to
free
Ned.”

“My
lady,
a
question,
as
it
please
you.”
Roose
Bolton,
Lord
of
the
Dreadfort,
had
a
small
voice,
yet
when
he
spoke
larger
men
quieted
to
listen.
His
eyes
were
curiously
pale,
almost
without
color,
and
his
look
disturbing.
“It
is
said
that
you
hold
Lord
Tywin’s
dwarf
son
as
captive.
Have
you
brought
him
to
us?
I
vow,
we
should
make
good
use
of
such
a
hostage.”

“I
did
hold
Tyrion
Lannister,
but
no
longer,”
Catelyn
was
forced
to
admit.
A
chorus
of
consternation
greeted
the
news.
“I
was
no
more
pleased
than
you,
my
lords.
The
gods
saw
fit
to
free
him,
with
some
help
from
my
fool
of
a
sister.”
She
ought
not
to
be
so
open
in
her
contempt,
she
knew,
but
her
parting
from
the
Eyrie
had
not
been
pleasant.
She
had
offered
to
take
Lord
Robert
with
her,
to
foster
him
at
Winterfell
for
a
few
years.
The
company
of
other
boys
would
do
him
good,
she
had
dared
to
suggest.
Lysa’s
rage
had
been
frightening
to
behold.
“Sister
or
no,”
she
had
replied,
“if
you
try
to
steal
my
son,
you
will
leave
by
the
Moon
Door.”
After
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said.

The
lords
were
anxious
to
question
her
further,
but
Catelyn
raised
a
hand.
“No
doubt
we
will
have
time
for
all
this
later,
but
my
journey
has
fatigued
me.
I
would
speak
with
my
son
alone.
I
know
you
will
forgive
me,
my
lords.”
She
gave
them
no
choice;
led
by
the
ever-obliging
Lord
Hornwood,
the
bannermen
bowed
and
took
their
leave.
“And
you,
Theon,”
she
added
when
Greyjoy
lingered.
He
smiled
and
left
them.

There
was
ale
and
cheese
on
the
table.
Catelyn
tilled
a
horn,
sat,
sipped,
and
studied
her
son.
He
seemed
taller
than
when
she’d
left,
and
the
wisps
of
beard
did
make
him
look
older.
“Edmure
was
sixteen
when
he
grew
his
first
whiskers.”

“I
will
be
sixteen
soon
enough,”
Robb
said.

“And
you
are
fifteen
now.
Fifteen,
and
leading
a
host
to
battle.
Can
you
understand
why
I
might
fear,
Robb?”

His
look
grew
stubborn.
“There
was
no
one
else.”

“No
one?”
she
said.
“Pray,
who
were
those
men
I
saw
here
a
moment
ago?
Roose
Bolton,
Rickard
Karstark,
Galbart
and
Robett
Glover,
the
Greatjon,
Helman
Tallhart…
you
might
have
given
the
command
to
any
of
them.
Gods
be
good,
you
might
even
have
sent
Theon,
though
he
would
not
be
my
choice.”

“They
are
not
Starks,”
he
said.

“They
are
men,
Robb,
seasoned
in
battle.
You
were
fighting
with
wooden
swords
less
than
a
year
past.”

She
saw
anger
in
his
eyes
at
that,
but
it
was
gone
as
quick
as
it
came,
and
suddenly
he
was
a
boy
again.
“I
know,”
he
said,
abashed.
“Are
you…
are
you
sending
me
back
to
Winterfell?”

Catelyn
sighed.
“I
should.
You
ought
never
have
left.
Yet
I
dare
not,
not
now.
You
have
come
too
far.
Someday
these
lords
will
look
to
you
as
their
liege.
If
I
pack
you
off
now,
like
a
child
being
sent
to
bed
without
his
supper,
they
will
remember,
and
laugh
about
it
in
their
cups.
The
day
will
come
when
you
need
them
to
respect
you,
even
fear
you
a
little.
Laughter
is
poison
to
fear.
I
will
not
do
that
to
you,
much
as
I
might
wish
to
keep
you
safe.”

“You
have
my
thanks,
Mother,”
he
said,
his
relief
obvious
beneath
the
formality.

She
reached
across
his
table
and
touched
his
hair.
“You
are
my
firstborn,
Robb.
I
have
only
to
look
at
you
to
remember
the
day
you
came
into
the
world,
red-faced
and
squalling.”

He
rose,
clearly
uncomfortable
with
her
touch,
and
walked
to
the
hearth.
Grey
Wind
rubbed
his
head
against
his
leg.
“You
know…
about
Father?”

“Yes.”
The
reports
of
Robert’s
sudden
death
and
Ned’s
fall
had
frightened
Catelyn
more
than
she
could
say,
but
she
would
not
let
her
son
see
her
fear.
“Lord
Manderly
told
me
when
I
landed
at
White
Harbor.
Have
you
had
any
word
of
your
sisters?”

“There
was
a
letter,”
Robb
said,
scratching
his
direwolf
under
the
jaw.
“One
for
you
as
well,
but
it
came
to
Winterfell
with
mine.”
He
went
to
the
table,
rummaged
among
some
maps
and
papers,
and
returned
with
a
crumpled
parchment.
“This
is
the
one
she
wrote
me,
I
never
thought
to
bring
yours.”

Something
in
Robb’s
tone
troubled
her.
She
smoothed
out
the
paper
and
read.
Concern
gave
way
to
disbelief,
then
to
anger,
and
lastly
to
fear.
“This
is
Cersei’s
letter,
not
your
sister’s,”
she
said
when
she
was
done.
“The
real
message
is
in
what
Sansa
does
not
say.
All
this
about
how
kindly
and
gently
the
Lannisters
are
treating
her…
I
know
the
sound
of
a
threat,
even
whispered.
They
have
Sansa
hostage,
and
they
mean
to
keep
her.”

“There’s
no
mention
of
Arya,”
Robb
pointed
out,
miserable.

“No.”
Catelyn
did
not
want
to
think
what
that
might
mean,
not
now,
not
here.

“I
had
hoped…
if
you
still
held
the
Imp,
a
trade
of
hostages…”
He
took
Sansa’s
letter
and
crumpled
it
in
his
fist,
and
she
could
tell
from
the
way
he
did
it
that
it
was
not
the
first
time.
“Is
there
word
from
the
Eyrie?
I
wrote
to
Aunt
Lysa,
asking
help.
Has
she
called
Lord
Arryn’s
banners,
do
you
know?
Will
the
knights
of
the
Vale
come
join
us?”

“Only
one,”
she
said,
“the
best
of
them,
my
uncle…
but
Brynden
Blackfish
was
a
Tully
first.
My
sister
is
not
about
to
stir
beyond
her
Bloody
Gate.”

Robb
took
it
hard.
“Mother,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
I
brought
this
whole
army
together,
eighteen
thousand
men,
but
I
don’t…
I’m
not
certain…”
He
looked
to
her,
his
eyes
shining,
the
proud
young
lord
melted
away
in
an
instant,
and
quick
as
that
he
was
a
child
again,
a
fifteen-year-old
boy
looking
to
his
mother
for
answers.

It
would
not
do.

“What
are
you
so
afraid
of,
Robb?”
she
asked
gently.

“I…”
He
turned
his
head
away,
to
hide
the
first
tear.
“If
we
march…
even
if
we
win…
the
Lannisters
hold
Sansa,
and
Father.
They’ll
kill
them,
won’t
they?”

“They
want
us
to
think
so.”

“You
mean
they’re
lying?”

“I
do
not
know,
Robb.
What
I
do
know
is
that
you
have
no
choice.
If
you
go
to
King’s
Landing
and
swear
fealty,
you
will
never
be
allowed
to
leave.
If
you
turn
your
tail
and
retreat
to
Winterfell,
your
lords
will
lose
all
respect
for
you.
Some
may
even
go
over
to
the
Lannisters.
Then
the
queen,
with
that
much
less
to
fear,
can
do
as
she
likes
with
her
prisoners.
Our
best
hope,
our
only
true
hope,
is
that
you
can
defeat
the
foe
in
the
field.
If
you
should
chance
to
take
Lord
Tywin
or
the
Kingslayer
captive,
why
then
a
trade
might
very
well
be
possible,
but
that
is
not
the
heart
of
it.
So
long
as
you
have
power
enough
that
they
must
fear
you,
Ned
and
your
sister
should
be
safe.
Cersei
is
wise
enough
to
know
that
she
may
need
them
to
make
her
peace,
should
the
fighting
go
against
her.”

“What
if
the
fighting
doesn’t
go
against
her?”
Robb
asked.
“What
if
it
goes
against
us?”

Catelyn
took
his
hand.
“Robb,
I
will
not
soften
the
truth
for
you.
If
you
lose,
there
is
no
hope
for
any
of
us.
They
say
there
is
naught
but
stone
at
the
heart
of
Casterly
Rock.
Remember
the
fate
of
Rhaegar’s
children.”

She
saw
the
fear
in
his
young
eyes
then,
but
there
was
a
strength
as
well.
“Then
I
will
not
lose,”
he
vowed.

“Tell
me
what
you
know
of
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands,”
she
said.
She
had
to
learn
if
he
was
truly
ready.

“Less
than
a
fortnight
past,
they
fought
a
battle
in
the
hills
below
the
Golden
Tooth,”
Robb
said.
“Uncle
Edmure
had
sent
Lord
Vance
and
Lord
Piper
to
hold
the
pass,
but
the
Kingslayer
descended
on
them
and
put
them
to
flight.
Lord
Vance
was
slain.
The
last
word
we
had
was
that
Lord
Piper
was
falling
back
to
join
your
brother
and
his
other
bannermen
at
Riverrun,
with
Jaime
Lannister
on
his
heels.
That’s
not
the
worst
of
it,
though.
All
the
time
they
were
battling
in
the
pass,
Lord
Tywin
was
bringing
a
second
Lannister
army
around
from
the
south.
It’s
said
to
be
even
larger
than
Jaime’s
host.

“Father
must
have
known
that,
because
he
sent
out
some
men
to
oppose
them,
under
the
king’s
own
banner.
He
gave
the
command
to
some
southron
lordling,
Lord
Erik
or
Derik
or
something
like
that,
but
Ser
Raymun
Darry
rode
with
him,
and
the
letter
said
there
were
other
knights
as
well,
and
a
force
of
Father’s
own
guardsmen.
Only
it
was
a
trap.
Lord
Derik
had
no
sooner
crossed
the
Red
Fork
than
the
Lannisters
fell
upon
him,
the
king’s
banner
be
damned,
and
Gregor
Clegane
took
them
in
the
rear
as
they
tried
to
pull
back
across
the
Mummer’s
Ford.
This
Lord
Derik
and
a
few
others
may
have
escaped,
no
one
is
certain,
but
Ser
Raymun
was
killed,
and
most
of
our
men
from
Winterfell.
Lord
Tywin
has
closed
off
the
kingsroad,
it’s
said,
and
now
he’s
marching
north
toward
Harrenhal,
burning
as
he
goes.”

Grim
and
grimmer,
thought
Catelyn.
It
was
worse
than
she’d
imagined.
“You
mean
to
meet
him
here?”
she
asked.

“If
he
comes
so
far,
but
no
one
thinks
he
will,”
Robb
said.
“I’ve
sent
word
to
Howland
Reed,
Father’s
old
friend
at
Greywater
Watch.
If
the
Lannisters
come
up
the
Neck,
the
crannogmen
will
bleed
them
every
step
of
the
way,
but
Galbart
Glover
says
Lord
Tywin
is
too
smart
for
that,
and
Roose
Bolton
agrees.
He’ll
stay
close
to
the
Trident,
they
believe,
taking
the
castles
of
the
river
lords
one
by
one,
until
Riverrun
stands
alone.
We
need
to
march
south
to
meet
him.”

The
very
idea
of
it
chilled
Catelyn
to
the
bone.
What
chance
would
a
fifteen-year-old
boy
have
against
seasoned
battle
commanders
like
Jaime
and
Tywin
Lannister?
“Is
that
wise?
You
are
strongly
placed
here.
It’s
said
that
the
old
Kings
in
the
North
could
stand
at
Moat
Cailin
and
throw
back
hosts
ten
times
the
size
of
their
own.”

“Yes,
but
our
food
and
supplies
are
running
low,
and
this
is
not
land
we
can
live
off
easily.
We’ve
been
waiting
for
Lord
Manderly,
but
now
that
his
sons
have
joined
us,
we
need
to
march.”

She
was
hearing
the
lords
bannermen
speaking
with
her
son’s
voice,
she
realized.
Over
the
years,
she
had
hosted
many
of
them
at
Winterfell,
and
been
welcomed
with
Ned
to
their
own
hearths
and
tables.
She
knew
what
sorts
of
men
they
were,
each
one.
She
wondered
if
Robb
did.

And
yet
there
was
sense
in
what
they
said.
This
host
her
son
had
assembled
was
not
a
standing
army
such
as
the
Free
Cities
were
accustomed
to
maintain,
nor
a
force
of
guardsmen
paid
in
coin.
Most
of
them
were
smallfolk:
crofters,
fieldhands,
fishermen,
sheepherders,
the
sons
of
innkeeps
and
traders
and
tanners,
leavened
with
a
smattering
of
sellswords
and
freeriders
hungry
for
plunder.
When
their
lords
called,
they
came…
but
not
forever.
“Marching
is
all
very
well,”
she
said
to
her
son,
“but
where,
and
to
what
purpose?
What
do
you
mean
to
do?”

Robb
hesitated.
“The
Greatjon
thinks
we
should
take
the
battle
to
Lord
Tywin
and
surprise
him,”
he
said,
“but
the
Glovers
and
the
Karstarks
feel
we’d
be
wiser
to
go
around
his
army
and
join
up
with
Uncle
Ser
Edmure
against
the
Kingslayer.”
He
ran
his
fingers
through
his
shaggy
mane
of
auburn
hair,
looking
unhappy.
“Though
by
the
time
we
reach
Riverrun…
I’m
not
certain…”

“Be
certain,”
Catelyn
told
her
son,
“or
go
home
and
take
up
that
wooden
sword
again.
You
cannot
afford
to
seem
indecisive
in
front
of
men
like
Roose
Bolton
and
Rickard
Karstark.
Make
no
mistake,
Robb—these
are
your
bannermen,
not
your
friends.
You
named
yourself
battle
commander.
Command.”

Her
son
looked
at
her,
startled,
as
if
he
could
not
credit
what
he
was
hearing.
“As
you
say,
Mother.”

“I’ll
ask
you
again.
What
do
you
mean
to
do?”

Robb
drew
a
map
across
the
table,
a
ragged
piece
of
old
leather
covered
with
lines
of
faded
paint.
One
end
curled
up
from
being
rolled;
he
weighed
it
down
with
his
dagger.
“Both
plans
have
virtues,
but…
look,
if
we
try
to
swing
around
Lord
Tywin’s
host,
we
take
the
risk
of
being
caught
between
him
and
the
Kingslayer,
and
if
we
attack
him…
by
all
reports,
he
has
more
men
than
I
do,
and
a
lot
more
armored
horse.
The
Greatjon
says
that
won’t
matter
if
we
catch
him
with
his
breeches
down,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
who
has
fought
as
many
battles
as
Tywin
Lannister
won’t
be
so
easily
surprised.”

“Good,”
she
said.
She
could
hear
echoes
of
Ned
in
his
voice,
as
he
sat
there,
puzzling
over
the
map.
“Tell
me
more.”

“I’d
leave
a
small
force
here
to
hold
Moat
Cailin,
archers
mostly,
and
march
the
rest
down
the
causeway,”
he
said,
“but
once
we’re
below
the
Neck,
I’d
split
our
host
in
two.
The
foot
can
continue
down
the
kingsroad,
while
our
horsemen
cross
the
Green
Fork
at
the
Twins.”
He
pointed.
“When
Lord
Tywin
gets
word
that
we’ve
come
south,
he’ll
march
north
to
engage
our
main
host,
leaving
our
riders
free
to
hurry
down
the
west
bank
to
Riverrun.”
Robb
sat
back,
not
quite
daring
to
smile,
but
pleased
with
himself
and
hungry
for
her
praise.

Catelyn
frowned
down
at
the
map.
“You’d
put
a
river
between
the
two
parts
of
your
army.”

“And
between
Jaime
and
Lord
Tywin,”
he
said
eagerly.
The
smile
came
at
last.
“There’s
no
crossing
on
the
Green
Fork
above
the
ruby
ford,
where
Robert
won
his
crown.
Not
until
the
Twins,
all
the
way
up
here,
and
Lord
Frey
controls
that
bridge.
He’s
your
father’s
bannerman,
isn’t
that
so?”

The
Late
Lord
Frey,
Catelyn
thought.
“He
is,”
she
admitted,
“but
my
father
has
never
trusted
him.
Nor
should
you.”

“I
won’t,”
Robb
promised.
“What
do
you
think?”

She
was
impressed
despite
herself.
He
looks
like
a
Tully,
she
thought,
yet
he’s
still
his
father’s
son,
and
Ned
taught
him
well.
“Which
force
would
you
command?”

“The
horse,”
he
answered
at
once.
Again
like
his
father;
Ned
would
always
take
the
more
dangerous
task
himself.

“And
the
other?”

“The
Greatjon
is
always
saying
that
we
should
smash
Lord
Tywin.
I
thought
I’d
give
him
the
honor.”

It
was
his
first
misstep,
but
how
to
make
him
see
it
without
wounding
his
fledgling
confidence?
“Your
father
once
told
me
that
the
Greatjon
was
as
fearless
as
any
man
he
had
ever
known.”

Robb
grinned.
“Grey
Wind
ate
two
of
his
fingers,
and
he
laughed
about
it.
So
you
agree,
then?”

“Your
father
is
not
fearless,”
Catelyn
pointed
out.
“He
is
brave,
but
that
is
very
different.”

Her
son
considered
that
for
a
moment.
“The
eastern
host
will
be
all
that
stands
between
Lord
Tywin
and
Winterfell,”
he
said
thoughtfully.
“Well,
them
and
whatever
few
bowmen
I
leave
here
at
the
Moat.
So
I
don’t
want
someone
fearless,
do
I?”

“No.
You
want
cold
cunning,
I
should
think,
not
courage.”

“Roose
Bolton,”
Robb
said
at
once.
“That
man
scares
me.”

“Then
let
us
pray
he
will
scare
Tywin
Lannister
as
well.”

Robb
nodded
and
rolled
up
the
map.
“I’ll
give
the
commands,
and
assemble
an
escort
to
take
you
home
to
Winterfell.”

Catelyn
had
fought
to
keep
herself
strong,
for
Ned’s
sake
and
for
this
stubborn
brave
son
of
theirs.
She
had
put
despair
and
fear
aside,
as
if
they
were
garments
she
did
not
choose
to
wear…
but
now
she
saw
that
she
had
donned
them
after
all.

“I
am
not
going
to
Winterfell,”
she
heard
herself
say,
surprised
at
the
sudden
rush
of
tears
that
blurred
her
vision.
“My
father
may
be
dying
behind
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
My
brother
is
surrounded
by
foes.
I
must
go
to
them.”





TYRION

Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
of
the
Black
Ears
had
gone
ahead
to
scout,
and
it
was
she
who
brought
back
word
of
the
army
at
the
crossroads.
“By
their
fires
I
call
them
twenty
thousand
strong,”
she
said.
“Their
banners
are
red,
with
a
golden
lion.”

“Your
father?”
Bronn
asked.

“Or
my
brother
Jaime,”
Tyrion
said.
“We
shall
know
soon
enough.”
He
surveyed
his
ragged
band
of
brigands:
near
three
hundred
Stone
Crows,
Moon
Brothers,
Black
Ears,
and
Burned
Men,
and
those
just
the
seed
of
the
army
he
hoped
to
grow.
Gunthor
son
of
Gurn
was
raising
the
other
clans
even
now.
He
wondered
what
his
lord
father
would
make
of
them
in
their
skins
and
bits
of
stolen
steel.
If
truth
be
told,
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
them
himself.
Was
he
their
commander
or
their
captive?
Most
of
the
time,
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
of
both.
“It
might
be
best
if
I
rode
down
alone,”
he
suggested.

“Best
for
Tyrion
son
of
Tywin,”
said
Ulf,
who
spoke
for
the
Moon
Brothers.

Shagga
glowered,
a
fearsome
sight
to
see.
“Shagga
son
of
Dolf
likes
this
not.
Shagga
will
go
with
the
boyman,
and
if
the
boyman
lies,
Shagga
will
chop
off
his
manhood—”

“—and
feed
it
to
the
goats,
yes,”
Tyrion
said
wearily.
“Shagga,
I
give
you
my
word
as
a
Lannister,
I
will
return.”

“Why
should
we
trust
your
word?”
Chella
was
a
small
hard
woman,
flat
as
a
boy,
and
no
fool.
“Lowland
lords
have
lied
to
the
clans
before.”

“You
wound
me,
Chella,”
Tyrion
said.
“Here
I
thought
we
had
become
such
friends.
But
as
you
will.
You
shall
ride
with
me,
and
Shagga
and
Conn
for
the
Stone
Crows,
Ulf
for
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
Timett
son
of
Timett
for
the
Burned
Men.”
The
clansmen
exchanged
wary
looks
as
he
named
them.
“The
rest
shall
wait
here
until
I
send
for
you.
Try
not
to
kill
and
maim
each
other
while
I’m
gone.”

He
put
his
heels
to
his
horse
and
trotted
off,
giving
them
no
choice
but
to
follow
or
be
left
behind.
Either
was
fine
with
him,
so
long
as
they
did
not
sit
down
to
talk
for
a
day
and
a
night.
That
was
the
trouble
with
the
clans;
they
had
an
absurd
notion
that
every
man’s
voice
should
be
heard
in
council,
so
they
argued
about
everything,
endlessly.
Even
their
women
were
allowed
to
speak.
Small
wonder
that
it
had
been
hundreds
of
years
since
they
last
threatened
the
Vale
with
anything
beyond
an
occasional
raid.
Tyrion
meant
to
change
that.

Brorm
rode
with
him.
Behind
them—after
a
quick
bit
of
grumbling—the
five
clansmen
followed
on
their
undersize
garrons,
scrawny
things
that
looked
like
ponies
and
scrambled
up
rock
walls
like
goats.

The
Stone
Crows
rode
together,
and
Chella
and
Ulf
stayed
close
as
well,
as
the
Moon
Brothers
and
Black
Ears
had
strong
bonds
between
them.
Timett
son
of
Timett
rode
alone.
Every
clan
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon
feared
the
Burned
Men,
who
mortified
their
flesh
with
fire
to
prove
their
courage
and
(the
others
said)
roasted
babies
at
their
feasts.
And
even
the
other
Burned
Men
feared
Timett,
who
had
put
out
his
own
left
eye
with
a
white-hot
knife
when
he
reached
the
age
of
manhood.
Tyrion
gathered
that
it
was
more
customary
for
a
boy
to
burn
off
a
nipple,
a
finger,
or
(if
he
was
truly
brave,
or
truly
mad)
an
ear.
Timett’s
fellow
Burned
Men
were
so
awed
by
his
choice
of
an
eye
that
they
promptly
named
him
a
red
hand,
which
seemed
to
be
some
sort
of
a
war
chief.

“I
wonder
what
their
king
burned
off,”
Tyrion
said
to
Bronn
when
he
heard
the
tale.
Grinning,
the
sellsword
had
tugged
at
his
crotch…
but
even
Bronn
kept
a
respectful
tongue
around
Timett.
If
a
man
was
mad
enough
to
put
out
his
own
eye,
he
was
unlikely
to
be
gentle
to
his
enemies.

Distant
watchers
peered
down
from
towers
of
unmortared
stone
as
the
party
descended
through
the
foothills,
and
once
Tyrion
saw
a
raven
take
wing.
Where
the
high
road
twisted
between
two
rocky
outcrops,
they
came
to
the
first
strong
point.
A
low
earthen
wall
four
feet
high
closed
off
the
road,
and
a
dozen
crossbowmen
manned
the
heights.
Tyrion
halted
his
followers
out
of
range
and
rode
to
the
wall
alone.
“Who
commands
here?”
he
shouted
up.

The
captain
was
quick
to
appear,
and
even
quicker
to
give
them
an
escort
when
he
recognized
his
lord’s
son.
They
trotted
past
blackened
fields
and
burned
holdfasts,
down
to
the
riverlands
and
the
Green
Fork
of
the
Trident.
Tyrion
saw
no
bodies,
but
the
air
was
full
of
ravens
and
carrion
crows;
there
had
been
fighting
here,
and
recently.

Half
a
league
from
the
crossroads,
a
barricade
of
sharpened
stakes
had
been
erected,
manned
by
pikemen
and
archers.
Behind
the
line,
the
camp
spread
out
to
the
far
distance.
Thin
fingers
of
smoke
rose
from
hundreds
of
cookfires,
mailed
men
sat
under
trees
and
honed
their
blades,
and
familiar
banners
fluttered
from
staffs
thrust
into
the
muddy
ground.

A
party
of
mounted
horsemen
rode
forward
to
challenge
them
as
they
approached
the
stakes.
The
knight
who
led
them
wore
silver
armor
inlaid
with
amethysts
and
a
striped
purple-and-silver
cloak.
His
shield
bore
a
unicorn
sigil,
and
a
spiral
horn
two
feet
long
jutted
up
from
the
brow
of
his
horsehead
helm.
Tyrion
reined
up
to
greet
him.
“Ser
Flement.”

Ser
Flement
Brax
lifted
his
visor.
“Tyrion,”
he
said
in
astonishment.
“My
lord,
we
all
feared
you
dead,
or…”
He
looked
at
the
clansmen
uncertainly.
“These…
companions
of
yours…”

“Bosom
friends
and
loyal
retainers,”
Tyrion
said.
“Where
will
I
find
my
lord
father?”

“He
has
taken
the
inn
at
the
crossroads
for
his
quarters.”

Tyrion
laughed.
The
inn
at
the
crossroads!
Perhaps
the
gods
were
just
after
all.
“I
will
see
him
at
once.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Ser
Flement
wheeled
his
horse
about
and
shouted
commands.
Three
rows
of
stakes
were
pulled
from
the
ground
to
make
a
hole
in
the
line.
Tyrion
led
his
party
through.

Lord
Tywin’s
camp
spread
over
leagues.
Chella’s
estimate
of
twenty
thousand
men
could
not
be
far
wrong.
The
common
men
camped
out
in
the
open,
but
the
knights
had
thrown
up
tents,
and
some
of
the
high
lords
had
erected
pavilions
as
large
as
houses.
Tyrion
spied
the
red
ox
of
the
Presters,
Lord
Crakehall’s
brindled
boar,
the
burning
tree
of
Marbrand,
the
badger
of
Lydden.
Knights
called
out
to
him
as
he
cantered
past,
and
men-at-arms
gaped
at
the
clansmen
in
open
astonishment.

Shagga
was
gaping
back;
beyond
a
certainty,
he
had
never
seen
so
many
men,
horses,
and
weapons
in
all
his
days.
The
rest
of
the
mountain
brigands
did
a
better
job
of
guarding
their
faces,
but
Tyrion
had
no
doubts
that
they
were
full
as
much
in
awe.
Better
and
better.
The
more
impressed
they
were
with
the
power
of
the
Lannisters,
the
easier
they
would
be
to
command.

The
inn
and
its
stables
were
much
as
he
remembered,
though
little
more
than
tumbled
stones
and
blackened
foundations
remained
where
the
rest
of
the
village
had
stood.
A
gibbet
had
been
erected
in
the
yard,
and
the
body
that
swung
there
was
covered
with
ravens.
At
Tyrion’s
approach
they
took
to
the
air,
squawking
and
flapping
their
black
wings.
He
dismounted
and
glanced
up
at
what
remained
of
the
corpse.
The
birds
had
eaten
her
lips
and
eyes
and
most
of
her
cheeks,
baring
her
stained
red
teeth
in
a
hideous
smile.
“A
room,
a
meal,
and
a
flagon
of
wine,
that
was
all
I
asked,”
he
reminded
her
with
a
sigh
of
reproach.

Boys
emerged
hesitantly
from
the
stables
to
see
to
their
horses.
Shagga
did
not
want
to
give
his
up.
“The
lad
won’t
steal
your
mare,”
Tyrion
assured
him.
“He
only
wants
to
give
her
some
oats
and
water
and
brush
out
her
coat.”
Shagga’s
coat
could
have
used
a
good
brushing
too,
but
it
would
have
been
less
than
tactful
to
mention
it.
“You
have
my
word,
the
horse
will
not
be
harmed.”

Glaring,
Shagga
let
go
his
grip
on
the
reins.
“This
is
the
horse
of
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,”
he
roared
at
the
stableboy.

“If
he
doesn’t
give
her
back,
chop
off
his
manhood
and
feed
it
to
the
goats,”
Tyrion
promised.
“Provided
you
can
find
some.”

A
pair
of
house
guards
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms
stood
under
the
inn’s
sign,
on
either
side
of
the
door.
Tyrion
recognized
their
captain.
“My
father?”

“In
the
common
room,
m’lord.”

“My
men
will
want
meat
and
mead,”
Tyrion
told
him.
“See
that
they
get
it.”
He
entered
the
inn,
and
there
was
Father.

Tywin
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Warden
of
the
West,
was
in
his
middle
fifties,
yet
hard
as
a
man
of
twenty.
Even
seated,
he
was
tall,
with
long
legs,
broad
shoulders,
a
flat
stomach.
His
thin
arms
were
corded
with
muscle.
When
his
once-thick
golden
hair
had
begun
to
recede,
he
had
commanded
his
barber
to
shave
his
head;
Lord
Tywin
did
not
believe
in
half
measures.
He
razored
his
lip
and
chin
as
well,
but
kept
his
side-whiskers,
two
great
thickets
of
wiry
golden
hair
that
covered
most
of
his
cheeks
from
ear
to
jaw.
His
eyes
were
a
pale
green,
flecked
with
gold.
A
fool
more
foolish
than
most
had
once
jested
that
even
Lord
Tywin’s
shit
was
flecked
with
gold.
Some
said
the
man
was
still
alive,
deep
in
the
bowels
of
Casterly
Rock.

Ser
Kevan
Lannister,
his
father’s
only
surviving
brother,
was
sharing
a
flagon
of
ale
with
Lord
Tywin
when
Tyrion
entered
the
common
room.
His
uncle
was
portly
and
balding,
with
a
close-cropped
yellow
beard
that
followed
the
line
of
his
massive
jaw.
Ser
Kevan
saw
him
first.
“Tyrion,”
he
said
in
surprise.

“Uncle,”
Tyrion
said,
bowing.
“And
my
lord
father.
What
a
pleasure
to
find
you
here.”

Lord
Tywin
did
not
stir
from
his
chair,
but
he
did
give
his
dwarf
son
a
long,
searching
look.
“I
see
that
the
rumors
of
your
demise
were
unfounded.”

“Sorry
to
disappoint
you,
Father,”
Tyrion
said.
“No
need
to
leap
up
and
embrace
me,
I
wouldn’t
want
you
to
strain
yourself.”
He
crossed
the
room
to
their
table,
acutely
conscious
of
the
way
his
stunted
legs
made
him
waddle
with
every
step.
Whenever
his
father’s
eyes
were
on
him,
he
became
uncomfortably
aware
of
all
his
deformities
and
shortcomings.
“Kind
of
you
to
go
to
war
for
me,”
he
said
as
he
climbed
into
a
chair
and
helped
himself
to
a
cup
of
his
father’s
ale.

“By
my
lights,
it
was
you
who
started
this,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“Your
brother
Jaime
would
never
have
meekly
submitted
to
capture
at
the
hands
of
a
woman.”

“That’s
one
way
we
differ,
Jaime
and
I.
He’s
taller
as
well,
you
may
have
noticed.”

His
father
ignored
the
sally.
“The
honor
of
our
House
was
at
stake.
I
had
no
choice
but
to
ride.
No
man
sheds
Lannister
blood
with
impunity.”

“Hear
Me
Roar,”
Tyrion
said,
grinning.
The
Lannister
words.
“Truth
be
told,
none
of
my
blood
was
actually
shed,
although
it
was
a
close
thing
once
or
twice.
Morrec
and
Jyck
were
killed.”

“I
suppose
you
will
be
wanting
some
new
men.”

“Don’t
trouble
yourself,
Father,
I’ve
acquired
a
few
of
my
own.”
He
tried
a
swallow
of
the
ale.
It
was
brown
and
yeasty,
so
thick
you
could
almost
chew
it.
Very
fine,
in
truth.
A
pity
his
father
had
hanged
the
innkeep.
“How
is
your
war
going?”

His
uncle
answered.
“Well
enough,
for
the
nonce.
Ser
Edmure
had
scattered
small
troops
of
men
along
his
borders
to
stop
our
raiding,
and
your
lord
father
and
I
were
able
to
destroy
most
of
them
piecemeal
before
they
could
regroup.”

“Your
brother
has
been
covering
himself
with
glory,”
his
father
said.
“He
smashed
the
Lords
Vance
and
Piper
at
the
Golden
Tooth,
and
met
the
massed
power
of
the
Tullys
under
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
The
lords
of
the
Trident
have
been
put
to
rout.
Ser
Edmure
Tully
was
taken
captive,
with
many
of
his
knights
and
bannermen.
Lord
Blackwood
led
a
few
survivors
back
to
Riverrun,
where
Jaime
has
them
under
siege.
The
rest
fled
to
their
own
strongholds.”

“Your
father
and
I
have
been
marching
on
each
in
turn,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“With
Lord
Blackwood
gone,
Raventree
fell
at
once,
and
Lady
Whent
yielded
Harrenhal
for
want
of
men
to
defend
it.
Ser
Gregor
burnt
out
the
Pipers
and
the
Brackens…”

“Leaving
you
unopposed?”
Tyrion
said.

“Not
wholly,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“The
Mallisters
still
hold
Seagard
and
Walder
Frey
is
marshaling
his
levies
at
the
Twins.”

“No
matter,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“Frey
only
takes
the
field
when
the
scent
of
victory
is
in
the
air,
and
all
he
smells
now
is
ruin.
And
Jason
Mallister
lacks
the
strength
to
fight
alone.
Once
Jaime
takes
Riverrun,
they
will
both
be
quick
enough
to
bend
the
knee.
Unless
the
Starks
and
the
Arryns
come
forth
to
oppose
us,
this
war
is
good
as
won.”

“I
would
not
fret
overmuch
about
the
Arryns
if
I
were
you,”
Tyrion
said.
“The
Starks
are
another
matter.
Lord
Eddard—”

“—is
our
hostage,”
his
father
said.
“He
will
lead
no
armies
while
he
rots
in
a
dungeon
under
the
Red
Keep.”

“No,”
Ser
Kevan
agreed,
“but
his
son
has
called
the
banners
and
sits
at
Moat
Cailin
with
a
strong
host
around
him.”

“No
sword
is
strong
until
it’s
been
tempered,”
Lord
Tywin
declared.
“The
Stark
boy
is
a
child.
No
doubt
he
likes
the
sound
of
warhorns
well
enough,
and
the
sight
of
his
banners
fluttering
in
the
wind,
but
in
the
end
it
comes
down
to
butcher’s
work.
I
doubt
he
has
the
stomach
for
it.”

Things
had
gotten
interesting
while
he’d
been
away,
Tyrion
reflected.
“And
what
is
our
fearless
monarch
doing
whilst
all
this
‘butcher’s
work’
is
being
done?”
he
wondered.
“How
has
my
lovely
and
persuasive
sister
gotten
Robert
to
agree
to
the
imprisonment
of
his
dear
friend
Ned?”

“Robert
Baratheon
is
dead,”
his
father
told
him.
“Your
nephew
reigns
in
King’s
Landing.”

That
did
take
Tyrion
aback.
“My
sister,
you
mean.”
He
took
another
gulp
of
ale.
The
realm
would
be
a
much
different
place
with
Cersei
ruling
in
place
of
her
husband.

“If
you
have
a
mind
to
make
yourself
of
use,
I
will
give
you
a
command,”
his
father
said.
“Marq
Piper
and
Karyl
Vance
are
loose
in
our
rear,
raiding
our
lands
across
the
Red
Fork.”

Tyrion
made
a
tsking
sound.
“The
gall
of
them,
fighting
back.
Ordinarily
I’d
be
glad
to
punish
such
rudeness,
Father,
but
the
truth
is,
I
have
pressing
business
elsewhere.”

“Do
you?”
Lord
Tywin
did
not
seem
awed.
“We
also
have
a
pair
of
Ned
Stark’s
afterthoughts
making
a
nuisance
of
themselves
by
harassing
my
foraging
parties.
Beric
Dondarrion,
some
young
lordling
with
delusions
of
valor.
He
has
that
fat
jape
of
a
priest
with
him,
the
one
who
likes
to
set
his
sword
on
fire.
Do
you
think
you
might
be
able
to
deal
with
them
as
you
scamper
off?
Without
making
too
much
a
botch
of
it?”

Tyrion
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
smiled.
“Father,
it
warms
my
heart
to
think
that
you
might
entrust
me
with…
what,
twenty
men?
Fifty?
Are
you
sure
you
can
spare
so
many?
Well,
no
matter.
If
I
should
come
across
Thoros
and
Lord
Beric,
I
shall
spank
them
both.”
He
climbed
down
from
his
chair
and
waddled
to
the
sideboard,
where
a
wheel
of
veined
white
cheese
sat
surrounded
by
fruit.
“First,
though,
I
have
some
promises
of
my
own
to
keep,”
he
said
as
he
sliced
off
a
wedge.
“I
shall
require
three
thousand
helms
and
as
many
hauberks,
plus
swords,
pikes,
steel
spearheads,
maces,
battleaxes,
gauntlets,
gorgets,
greaves,
breastplates,
wagons
to
carry
all
this—”

The
door
behind
him
opened
with
a
crash,
so
violently
that
Tyrion
almost
dropped
his
cheese.
Ser
Kevan
leapt
up
swearing
as
the
captain
of
the
guard
went
flying
across
the
room
to
smash
against
the
hearth.
As
he
tumbled
down
into
the
cold
ashes,
his
lion
helm
askew,
Shagga
snapped
the
man’s
sword
in
two
over
a
knee
thick
as
a
tree
trunk,
threw
down
the
pieces,
and
lumbered
into
the
common
room.
He
was
preceded
by
his
stench,
riper
than
the
cheese
and
overpowering
in
the
closed
space.
“Little
redcape,”
he
snarled,
“when
next
you
bare
steel
on
Shagga
son
of
Dolf,
I
will
chop
off
your
manhood
and
roast
it
in
the
fire.”

“What,
no
goats?”
Tyrion
said,
taking
a
bite
of
cheese.

The
other
clansmen
followed
Shagga
into
the
common
room,
Bronn
with
them.
The
sellsword
gave
Tyrion
a
rueful
shrug.

“Who
might
you
be?”
Lord
Tywin
asked,
cool
as
snow.

“They
followed
me
home,
Father,”
Tyrion
explained.
“May
I
keep
them?
They
don’t
eat
much.”

No
one
was
smiling.
“By
what
right
do
you
savages
intrude
on
our
councils?”
demanded
Ser
Kevan.

“Savages,
lowlander?”
Conn
might
have
been
handsome
if
you
washed
him.
“We
are
free
men,
and
free
men
by
rights
sit
on
all
war
councils.”

“Which
one
is
the
lion
lord?”
Chella
asked.

“They
are
both
old
men,”
announced
Timett
son
of
Timett,
who
had
yet
to
see
his
twentieth
year.

Ser
Kevan’s
hand
went
to
his
sword
hilt,
but
his
brother
placed
two
fingers
on
his
wrist
and
held
him
fast.
Lord
Tywin
seemed
unperturbed.
“Tyrion,
have
you
forgotten
your
courtesies?
Kindly
acquaint
us
with
our…
honored
guests.”

Tyrion
licked
his
fingers.
“With
pleasure,”
he
said.
“The
fair
maid
is
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
of
the
Black
Ears.”

“I’m
no
maid,”
Chella
protested.
“My
sons
have
taken
fifty
ears
among
them.”

“May
they
take
fifty
more.”
Tyrion
waddled
away
from
her.
“This
is
Conn
son
of
Coratt.
Shagga
son
of
Dolf
is
the
one
who
looks
like
Casterly
Rock
with
hair.
They
are
Stone
Crows.
Here
is
Ulf
son
of
Umar
of
the
Moon
Brothers,
and
here
Timett
son
of
Timett,
a
red
hand
of
the
Burned
Men.
And
this
is
Bronn,
a
sellsword
of
no
particular
allegiance.
He
has
already
changed
sides
twice
in
the
short
time
I’ve
known
him,
you
and
he
ought
to
get
on
famously,
Father.”
To
Bronn
and
the
clansmen
he
said,
“May
I
present
my
lord
father,
Tywin
son
of
Tytos
of
House
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock,
Warden
of
the
West,
Shield
of
Lannisport,
and
once
and
future
Hand
of
the
King.”

Lord
Tywin
rose,
dignified
and
correct.
“Even
in
the
west,
we
know
the
prowess
of
the
warrior
clans
of
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.
What
brings
you
down
from
your
strongholds,
my
lords?”

“Horses,”
said
Shagga.

“A
promise
of
silk
and
steel,”
said
Timett
son
of
Timett.

Tyrion
was
about
to
tell
his
lord
father
how
he
proposed
to
reduce
the
Vale
of
Arryn
to
a
smoking
wasteland,
but
he
was
never
given
the
chance.
The
door
banged
open
again.
The
messenger
gave
Tyrion’s
clansmen
a
quick,
queer
look
as
he
dropped
to
one
knee
before
Lord
Tywin.
“My
lord,”
he
said,
“Ser
Addam
bid
me
tell
you
that
the
Stark
host
is
moving
down
the
causeway.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
did
not
smile.
Lord
Tywin
never
smiled,
but
Tyrion
had
learned
to
read
his
father’s
pleasure
all
the
same,
and
it
was
there
on
his
face.
“So
the
wolfling
is
leaving
his
den
to
play
among
the
lions,”
he
said
in
a
voice
of
quiet
satisfaction.
“Splendid.
Return
to
Ser
Addam
and
tell
him
to
fall
back.
He
is
not
to
engage
the
northerners
until
we
arrive,
but
I
want
him
to
harass
their
flanks
and
draw
them
farther
south.”

“It
will
be
as
you
command.”
The
rider
took
his
leave.

“We
are
well
situated
here,”
Ser
Kevan
pointed
out.
“Close
to
the
ford
and
ringed
by
pits
and
spikes.
If
they
are
coming
south,
I
say
let
them
come,
and
break
themselves
against
us.”

“The
boy
may
hang
back
or
lose
his
courage
when
he
sees
our
numbers,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“The
sooner
the
Starks
are
broken,
the
sooner
I
shall
be
free
to
deal
with
Stannis
Baratheon.
Tell
the
drummers
to
beat
assembly,
and
send
word
to
Jaime
that
I
am
marching
against
Robb
Stark.”

“As
you
will,”
Ser
Kevan
said.

Tyrion
watched
with
a
grim
fascination
as
his
lord
father
turned
next
to
the
half-wild
clansmen.
“It
is
said
that
the
men
of
the
mountain
clans
are
warriors
without
fear.”

“It
is
said
truly,”
Conn
of
the
Stone
Crows
answered.

“And
the
women,”
Chella
added.

“Ride
with
me
against
my
enemies,
and
you
shall
have
all
my
son
promised
you,
and
more,”
Lord
Tywin
told
them.

“Would
you
pay
us
with
our
own
coin?”
Ulf
son
of
Umar
said.
“Why
should
we
need
the
father’s
promise,
when
we
have
the
son’s?”

“I
said
nothing
of
need,”
Lord
Tywin
replied.
“My
words
were
courtesy,
nothing
more.
You
need
not
join
us.
The
men
of
the
winterlands
are
made
of
iron
and
ice,
and
even
my
boldest
knights
fear
to
face
them.”

Oh,
deftly
done,
Tyrion
thought,
smiling
crookedly.

“The
Burned
Men
fear
nothing.
Timett
son
of
Timett
will
ride
with
the
lions.”

“Wherever
the
Burned
Men
go,
the
Stone
Crows
have
been
there
first,”
Conn
declared
hotly.
“We
ride
as
well.”

“Shagga
son
of
Dolf
will
chop
off
their
manhoods
and
feed
them
to
the
crows.”

“We
will
ride
with
you,
lion
lord,”
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
agreed,
“but
only
if
your
halfman
son
goes
with
us.
He
has
bought
his
breath
with
promises.
Until
we
hold
the
steel
he
has
pledged
us,
his
life
is
ours.”

Lord
Tywin
turned
his
gold-flecked
eyes
on
his
son.

“Joy,”
Tyrion
said
with
a
resigned
smile.





SANSA

The
walls
of
the
throne
room
had
been
stripped
bare,
the
hunting
tapestries
that
King
Robert
loved
taken
down
and
stacked
in
the
corner
in
an
untidy
heap.

Ser
Mandon
Moore
went
to
take
his
place
under
the
throne
beside
two
of
his
fellows
of
the
Kingsguard.
Sansa
hovered
by
the
door,
for
once
unguarded.
The
queen
had
given
her
freedom
of
the
castle
as
a
reward
for
being
good,
yet
even
so,
she
was
escorted
everywhere
she
went.
“Honor
guards
for
my
daughter-to-be,”
the
queen
called
them,
but
they
did
not
make
Sansa
feel
honored.

“Freedom
of
the
castle”
meant
that
she
could
go
wherever
she
chose
within
the
Red
Keep
so
long
as
she
promised
not
to
go
beyond
the
walls,
a
promise
Sansa
had
been
more
than
willing
to
give.
She
couldn’t
have
gone
beyond
the
walls
anyway.
The
gates
were
watched
day
and
night
by
Janos
Slynt’s
gold
cloaks,
and
Lannister
house
guards
were
always
about
as
well.
Besides,
even
if
she
could
leave
the
castle,
where
would
she
go?
It
was
enough
that
she
could
walk
in
the
yard,
pick
flowers
in
Myrcella’s
garden,
and
visit
the
sept
to
pray
for
her
father.
Sometimes
she
prayed
in
the
godswood
as
well,
since
the
Starks
kept
the
old
gods.

This
was
the
first
court
session
of
Joffrey’s
reign,
so
Sansa
looked
about
nervously.
A
line
of
Lannister
house
guards
stood
beneath
the
western
windows,
a
line
of
gold-cloaked
City
Watchmen
beneath
the
east.
Of
smallfolk
and
commoners,
she
saw
no
sign,
but
under
the
gallery
a
cluster
of
lords
great
and
small
milled
restlessly.
There
were
no
more
than
twenty,
where
a
hundred
had
been
accustomed
to
wait
upon
King
Robert.

Sansa
slipped
in
among
them,
murmuring
greetings
as
she
worked
her
way
toward
the
front.
She
recognized
black-skinned
Jalabhar
Xho,
gloomy
Ser
Aron
Santagar,
the
Redwyne
twins
Horror
and
Slobber…
only
none
of
them
seemed
to
recognize
her.
Or
if
they
did,
they
shied
away
as
if
she
had
the
grey
plague.
Sickly
Lord
Gyles
covered
his
face
at
her
approach
and
feigned
a
fit
of
coughing,
and
when
funny
drunken
Ser
Dontos
started
to
hail
her,
Ser
Balon
Swann
whispered
in
his
ear
and
he
turned
away.

And
so
many
others
were
missing.
Where
had
the
rest
of
them
gone?
Sansa
wondered.
Vainly,
she
searched
for
friendly
faces.
Not
one
of
them
would
meet
her
eyes.
It
was
as
if
she
had
become
a
ghost,
dead
before
her
time.

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
was
seated
alone
at
the
council
table,
seemingly
asleep,
his
hands
clasped
together
atop
his
beard.
She
saw
Lord
Varys
hurry
into
the
hall,
his
feet
making
no
sound.
A
moment
later
Lord
Baelish
entered
through
the
tall
doors
in
the
rear,
smiling.
He
chatted
amiably
with
Ser
Balon
and
Ser
Dontos
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
front.
Butterflies
fluttered
nervously
in
Sansa’s
stomach.
I
shouldn’t
be
afraid,
she
told
herself.
I
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of,
it
will
all
come
out
well,
Joff
loves
me
and
the
queen
does
too,
she
said
so.

A
herald’s
voice
rang
out.
“All
hail
His
Grace,
Joffrey
of
the
Houses
Baratheon
and
Lannister,
the
First
of
his
Name,
King
of
the
Andals,
the
Rhoynar,
and
the
First
Men,
and
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
All
hail
his
lady
mother,
Cersei
of
House
Lannister,
Queen
Regent,
Light
of
the
West,
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
resplendent
in
white
plate,
led
them
in.
Ser
Arys
Oakheart
escorted
the
queen,
while
Ser
Boros
Blount
walked
beside
Joffrey,
so
six
of
the
Kingsguard
were
now
in
the
hall,
all
the
White
Swords
save
Jaime
Lannister
alone.
Her
prince—no,
her
king
now!—took
the
steps
of
the
Iron
Throne
two
at
a
time,
while
his
mother
was
seated
with
the
council.
Joff
wore
plush
black
velvets
slashed
with
crimson,
a
shimmering
cloth-of-gold
cape
with
a
high
collar,
and
on
his
head
a
golden
crown
crusted
with
rubies
and
black
diamonds.

When
Joffrey
turned
to
look
out
over
the
hall,
his
eye
caught
Sansa’s.
He
smiled,
seated
himself,
and
spoke.
“It
is
a
king’s
duty
to
punish
the
disloyal
and
reward
those
who
are
true.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
I
command
you
to
read
my
decrees.”

Pycelle
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
He
was
clad
in
a
magnificent
robe
of
thick
red
velvet,
with
an
ermine
collar
and
shiny
gold
fastenings.
From
a
drooping
sleeve,
heavy
with
gilded
scrollwork,
he
drew
a
parchment,
unrolled
it,
and
began
to
read
a
long
list
of
names,
commanding
each
in
the
name
of
king
and
council
to
present
themselves
and
swear
their
fealty
to
Joffrey.
Failing
that,
they
would
be
adjudged
traitors,
their
lands
and
titles
forfeit
to
the
throne.

The
names
he
read
made
Sansa
hold
her
breath.
Lord
Stannis
Baratheon,
his
lady
wife,
his
daughter.
Lord
Renly
Baratheon.
Both
Lord
Royces
and
their
sons.
Ser
Loras
Tyrell.
Lord
Mace
Tyrell,
his
brothers,
uncles,
sons.
The
red
priest,
Thoros
of
Myr.
Lord
Beric
Dondarrion.
Lady
Lysa
Arryn
and
her
son,
the
little
Lord
Robert.
Lord
Hoster
Tully,
his
brother
Ser
Brynden,
his
son
Ser
Edmure.
Lord
Jason
Mallister.
Lord
Bryce
Caron
of
the
Marches.
Lord
Tytos
Blackwood.
Lord
Walder
Frey
and
his
heir
Ser
Stevron.
Lord
Karyl
Vance.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken.
Lady
Sheila
Whent.
Doran
Martell,
Prince
of
Dorne,
and
all
his
sons.
So
many,
she
thought
as
Pycelle
read
on
and
on,
it
will
take
a
whole
flock
of
ravens
to
send
out
these
commands.

And
at
the
end,
near
last,
came
the
names
Sansa
had
been
dreading.
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.
Robb
Stark.
Brandon
Stark,
Rickon
Stark,
Arya
Stark.
Sansa
stifled
a
gasp.
Arya.
They
wanted
Arya
to
present
herself
and
swear
an
oath…
it
must
mean
her
sister
had
fled
on
the
galley,
she
must
be
safe
at
Winterfell
by
now…

Grand
Maester
Pycelle
rolled
up
the
list,
tucked
it
up
his
left
sleeve,
and
pulled
another
parchment
from
his
right.
He
cleared
his
throat
and
resumed.
“In
the
place
of
the
traitor
Eddard
Stark,
it
is
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
Tywin
Lannister,
Lord
of
Casterly
Rock
and
Warden
of
the
West,
take
up
the
office
of
Hand
of
the
King,
to
speak
with
his
voice,
lead
his
armies
against
his
enemies,
and
carry
out
his
royal
will.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.

“In
the
place
of
the
traitor
Stannis
Baratheon,
it
is
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
his
lady
mother,
the
Queen
Regent
Cersei
Lannister,
who
has
ever
been
his
staunchest
support,
be
seated
upon
his
small
council,
that
she
may
help
him
rule
wisely
and
with
justice.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.”

Sansa
heard
a
soft
murmuring
from
the
lords
around
her,
but
it
was
quickly
stilled.
Pycelle
continued.

“It
is
also
the
wish
of
His
Grace
that
his
loyal
servant,
Janos
Slynt,
Commander
of
the
City
Watch
of
King’s
Landing,
be
at
once
raised
to
the
rank
of
lord
and
granted
the
ancient
seat
of
Harrenhal
with
all
its
attendant
lands
and
incomes,
and
that
his
sons
and
grandsons
shall
hold
these
honors
after
him
until
the
end
of
time.
It
is
moreover
his
command
that
Lord
Slynt
be
seated
immediately
upon
his
small
council,
to
assist
in
the
governance
of
the
realm.
So
the
king
has
decreed.
The
small
council
consents.”

Sansa
glimpsed
motion
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
as
Janos
Slynt
made
his
entrance.
This
time
the
muttering
was
louder
and
angrier.
Proud
lords
whose
houses
went
back
thousands
of
years
made
way
reluctantly
for
the
balding,
frog-faced
commoner
as
he
marched
past.
Golden
scales
had
been
sewn
onto
the
black
velvet
of
his
doublet
and
rang
together
softly
with
each
step.
His
cloak
was
checked
black-and-gold
satin.
Two
ugly
boys
who
must
have
been
his
sons
went
before
him,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
a
heavy
metal
shield
as
tall
as
they
were.
For
his
sigil
he
had
taken
a
bloody
spear,
gold
on
a
night-black
field.
The
sight
of
it
raised
goose
prickles
up
and
down
Sansa’s
arms.

As
Lord
Slynt
took
his
place,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
resumed.
“Lastly,
in
these
times
of
treason
and
turmoil,
with
our
beloved
Robert
so
lately
dead,
it
is
the
view
of
the
council
that
the
life
and
safety
of
King
Joffrey
is
of
paramount
importance…”
He
looked
to
the
queen.

Cersei
stood.
“Ser
Barristan
Selmy,
stand
forth.”

Ser
Barristan
had
been
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne,
as
still
as
any
statue,
but
now
he
went
to
one
knee
and
bowed
his
head.
“Your
Grace,
I
am
yours
to
command.”

“Rise,
Ser
Barristan,”
Cersei
Lannister
said.
“You
may
remove
your
helm.”

“My
lady?”
Standing,
the
old
knight
took
off
his
high
white
helm,
though
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
why.

“You
have
served
the
realm
long
and
faithfully,
good
ser,
and
every
man
and
woman
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
owes
you
thanks.
Yet
now
I
fear
your
service
is
at
an
end.
It
is
the
wish
of
king
and
council
that
you
lay
down
your
heavy
burden.”

“My…
burden?
I
fear
I…
I
do
not…”

The
new-made
lord,
Janos
Slynt,
spoke
up,
his
voice
heavy
and
blunt.
“Her
Grace
is
trying
to
tell
you
that
you
are
relieved
as
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard.”

The
tall,
white-haired
knight
seemed
to
shrink
as
he
stood
there,
scarcely
breathing.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said
at
last.
“The
Kingsguard
is
a
Sworn
Brotherhood.
Our
vows
are
taken
for
life.
Only
death
may
relieve
the
Lord
Commander
of
his
sacred
trust.”

“Whose
death,
Ser
Barristan?”
The
queen’s
voice
was
soft
as
silk,
but
her
words
carried
the
whole
length
of
the
hall.
“Yours,
or
your
king’s?”

“You
let
my
father
die,”
Joffrey
said
accusingly
from
atop
the
Iron
Throne.
“You’re
too
old
to
protect
anybody.”

Sansa
watched
as
the
knight
peered
up
at
his
new
king.
She
had
never
seen
him
look
his
years
before,
yet
now
he
did.
“Your
Grace,”
he
said.
“I
was
chosen
for
the
White
Swords
in
my
twenty-third
year.
It
was
all
I
had
ever
dreamed,
from
the
moment
I
first
took
sword
in
hand.
I
gave
up
all
claim
to
my
ancestral
keep.
The
girl
I
was
to
wed
married
my
cousin
in
my
place,
I
had
no
need
of
land
or
sons,
my
life
would
be
lived
for
the
realm.
Ser
Gerold
Hightower
himself
heard
my
vows…
to
ward
the
king
with
all
my
strength…
to
give
my
blood
for
his…
I
fought
beside
the
White
Bull
and
Prince
Lewyn
of
Dorne…
beside
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.
Before
I
served
your
father,
I
helped
shield
King
Aerys,
and
his
father
Jaehaerys
before
him…
three
kings…”

“And
all
of
them
dead,”
Littlefinger
pointed
out.

“Your
time
is
done,”
Cersei
Lannister
announced.
“Joffrey
requires
men
around
him
who
are
young
and
strong.
The
council
has
determined
that
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
will
take
your
place
as
the
Lord
Commander
of
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
White
Swords.”

“The
Kingslayer,”
Ser
Barristan
said,
his
voice
hard
with
contempt.
“The
false
knight
who
profaned
his
blade
with
the
blood
of
the
king
he
had
sworn
to
defend.”

“Have
a
care
for
your
words,
ser,”
the
queen
warned.
“You
are
speaking
of
our
beloved
brother,
your
king’s
own
blood.”

Lord
Varys
spoke,
gentler
than
the
others.
“We
are
not
unmindful
of
your
service,
good
ser.
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
has
generously
agreed
to
grant
you
a
handsome
tract
of
land
north
of
Lannisport,
beside
the
sea,
with
gold
and
men
sufficient
to
build
you
a
stout
keep,
and
servants
to
see
to
your
every
need.”

Ser
Barristan
looked
up
sharply.
“A
hall
to
die
in,
and
men
to
bury
me.
I
thank
you,
my
lords…
but
I
spit
upon
your
pity.”
He
reached
up
and
undid
the
clasps
that
held
his
cloak
in
place,
and
the
heavy
white
garment
slithered
from
his
shoulders
to
fall
in
a
heap
on
the
floor.
His
helmet
dropped
with
a
clang.
“I
am
a
knight,”
he
told
them.
He
opened
the
silver
fastenings
of
his
breastplate
and
let
that
fall
as
well.
“I
shall
die
a
knight.”

“A
naked
knight,
it
would
seem,”
quipped
Littlefinger.

They
all
laughed
then,
Joffrey
on
his
throne,
and
the
lords
standing
attendance,
Janos
Slynt
and
Queen
Cersei
and
Sandor
Clegane
and
even
the
other
men
of
the
Kingsguard,
the
five
who
had
been
his
brothers
until
a
moment
ago.
Surely
that
must
have
hurt
the
most,
Sansa
thought.
Her
heart
went
out
to
the
gallant
old
man
as
he
stood
shamed
and
red-faced,
too
angry
to
speak.
Finally
he
drew
his
sword.

Sansa
heard
someone
gasp.
Ser
Boros
and
Ser
Meryn
moved
forward
to
confront
him,
but
Ser
Barristan
froze
them
in
place
with
a
look
that
dripped
contempt.
“Have
no
fear,
sers,
your
king
is
safe…
no
thanks
to
you.
Even
now,
I
could
cut
through
the
five
of
you
as
easy
as
a
dagger
cuts
cheese.
If
you
would
serve
under
the
Kingslayer,
not
a
one
of
you
is
fit
to
wear
the
white.”
He
flung
his
sword
at
the
foot
of
the
Iron
Throne.
“Here,
boy.
Melt
it
down
and
add
it
to
the
others,
if
you
like.
It
will
do
you
more
good
than
the
swords
in
the
hands
of
these
five.
Perhaps
Lord
Stannis
will
chance
to
sit
on
it
when
he
takes
your
throne.”

He
took
the
long
way
out,
his
steps
ringing
loud
against
the
floor
and
echoing
off
the
bare
stone
walls.
Lords
and
ladies
parted
to
let
him
pass.
Not
until
the
pages
had
closed
the
great
oak-and-bronze
doors
behind
him
did
Sansa
hear
sounds
again:
soft
voices,
uneasy
stirrings,
the
shuffle
of
papers
from
the
council
table.
“He
called
me
boy,”
Joffrey
said
peevishly,
sounding
younger
than
his
years.
“He
talked
about
my
uncle
Stannis
too.”

“Idle
talk,”
said
Varys
the
eunuch.
“Without
meaning…”

“He
could
be
making
plots
with
my
uncles.
I
want
him
seized
and
questioned.”
No
one
moved.
Joffrey
raised
his
voice.
“I
said,
I
want
him
seized!”

Janos
Slynt
rose
from
the
council
table.
“My
gold
cloaks
will
see
to
it,
Your
Grace.”

“Good,”
said
King
Joffrey.
Lord
Janos
strode
from
the
hall,
his
ugly
sons
double-stepping
to
keep
up
as
they
lugged
the
great
metal
shield
with
the
arms
of
House
Slynt.

“Your
Grace,”
Littlefinger
reminded
the
king.
“If
we
might
resume,
the
seven
are
now
six.
We
find
ourselves
in
need
of
a
new
sword
for
your
Kingsguard.”

Joffrey
smiled.
“Tell
them,
Mother.”

“The
king
and
council
have
determined
that
no
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
is
more
fit
to
guard
and
protect
His
Grace
than
his
sworn
shield,
Sandor
Clegane.”

“How
do
you
like
that,
dog?”
King
Joffrey
asked.

The
Hound’s
scarred
face
was
hard
to
read.
He
took
a
long
moment
to
consider.
“Why
not?
I
have
no
lands
nor
wife
to
forsake,
and
who’d
care
if
I
did?”
The
burned
side
of
his
mouth
twisted.
“But
I
warn
you,
I’ll
say
no
knight’s
vows.”

“The
Sworn
Brothers
of
the
Kingsguard
have
always
been
knights,”
Ser
Boros
said
firmly.

“Until
now,”
the
Hound
said
in
his
deep
rasp,
and
Ser
Boros
fell
silent.

When
the
king’s
herald
moved
forward,
Sansa
realized
the
moment
was
almost
at
hand.
She
smoothed
down
the
cloth
of
her
skirt
nervously.
She
was
dressed
in
mourning,
as
a
sign
of
respect
for
the
dead
king,
but
she
had
taken
special
care
to
make
herself
beautiful.
Her
gown
was
the
ivory
silk
that
the
queen
had
given
her,
the
one
Arya
had
ruined,
but
she’d
had
them
dye
it
black
and
you
couldn’t
see
the
stain
at
all.
She
had
fretted
over
her
jewelry
for
hours
and
finally
decided
upon
the
elegant
simplicity
of
a
plain
silver
chain.

The
herald’s
voice
boomed
out.
“If
any
man
in
this
hall
has
other
matters
to
set
before
His
Grace,
let
him
speak
now
or
go
forth
and
hold
his
silence.”

Sansa
quailed.
Now,
she
told
herself,
I
must
do
it
now.
Gods
give
me
courage.
She
took
one
step,
then
another.
Lords
and
knights
stepped
aside
silently
to
let
her
pass,
and
she
felt
the
weight
of
their
eyes
on
her.
I
must
be
as
strong
as
my
lady
mother.
“Your
Grace,”
she
called
out
in
a
soft,
tremulous
voice.

The
height
of
the
Iron
Throne
gave
Joffrey
a
better
vantage
point
than
anyone
else
in
the
hall.
He
was
the
first
to
see
her.
“Come
forward,
my
lady,”
he
called
out,
smiling.

His
smile
emboldened
her,
made
her
feel
beautiful
and
strong.
He
does
love
me,
he
does.
Sansa
lifted
her
head
and
walked
toward
him,
not
too
slow
and
not
too
fast.
She
must
not
let
them
see
how
nervous
she
was.

“The
Lady
Sansa,
of
House
Stark,”
the
herald
cried.

She
stopped
under
the
throne,
at
the
spot
where
Ser
Barristan’s
white
cloak
lay
puddled
on
the
floor
beside
his
helm
and
breastplate.
“Do
you
have
some
business
for
king
and
council,
Sansa?”
the
queen
asked
from
the
council
table.

“I
do.”
She
knelt
on
the
cloak,
so
as
not
to
spoil
her
gown,
and
looked
up
at
her
prince
on
his
fearsome
black
throne.
“As
it
please
Your
Grace,
I
ask
mercy
for
my
father,
Lord
Eddard
Stark,
who
was
the
Hand
of
the
King.”
She
had
practiced
the
words
a
hundred
times.

The
queen
sighed.
“Sansa,
you
disappoint
me.
What
did
I
tell
you
about
traitor’s
blood?”

“Your
father
has
committed
grave
and
terrible
crimes,
my
lady,”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
intoned.

“Ah,
poor
sad
thing,”
sighed
Varys.
“She
is
only
a
babe,
my
lords,
she
does
not
know
what
she
asks.”

Sansa
had
eyes
only
for
Joffrey.
He
must
listen
to
me,
he
must,
she
thought.
The
king
shifted
on
his
seat,
“Let
her
speak,”
he
commanded.
“I
want
to
hear
what
she
says.”

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace.”
Sansa
smiled,
a
shy
secret
smile,
just
for
him.
He
was
listening.
She
knew
he
would.

“Treason
is
a
noxious
weed,”
Pycelle
declared
solemnly.
“It
must
be
torn
up,
root
and
stem
and
seed,
lest
new
traitors
sprout
from
every
roadside.”

“Do
you
deny
your
father’s
crime?”
Lord
Baelish
asked.

“No,
my
lords.”
Sansa
knew
better
than
that.
“I
know
he
must
be
punished.
All
I
ask
is
mercy.
I
know
my
lord
father
must
regret
what
he
did.
He
was
King
Robert’s
friend
and
he
loved
him,
you
all
know
he
loved
him.
He
never
wanted
to
be
Hand
until
the
king
asked
him.
They
must
have
lied
to
him.
Lord
Renly
or
Lord
Stannis
or…
or
somebody,
they
must
have
lied,
otherwise…”

King
Joffrey
leaned
forward,
hands
grasping
the
arms
of
the
throne.
Broken
sword
points
fanned
out
between
his
fingers.
“He
said
I
wasn’t
the
king.
Why
did
he
say
that?”

“His
leg
was
broken,”
Sansa
replied
eagerly.
“It
hurt
ever
so
much,
Maester
Pycelle
was
giving
him
milk
of
the
poppy,
and
they
say
that
milk
of
the
poppy
fills
your
head
with
clouds.
Otherwise
he
would
never
have
said
it.”

Varys
said,
“A
child’s
faith…
such
sweet
innocence…
and
yet,
they
say
wisdom
oft
comes
from
the
mouths
of
babes.”

“Treason
is
treason,”
Pycelle
replied
at
once.

Joffrey
rocked
restlessly
on
the
throne.
“Mother?”

Cersei
Lannister
considered
Sansa
thoughtfully.
“If
Lord
Eddard
were
to
confess
his
crime,”
she
said
at
last,
“we
would
know
he
had
repented
his
folly.”

Joffrey
pushed
himself
to
his
feet.
Please,
Sansa
thought,
please,
please,
be
the
king
I
know
you
are,
good
and
kind
and
noble,
please.
“Do
you
have
any
more
to
say?”
he
asked
her.

“Only…
that
as
you
love
me,
you
do
me
this
kindness,
my
prince,”
Sansa
said.

King
Joffrey
looked
her
up
and
down.
“Your
sweet
words
have
moved
me,”
he
said
gallantly,
nodding,
as
if
to
say
all
would
be
well.
“I
shall
do
as
you
ask…
but
first
your
father
has
to
confess.
He
has
to
confess
and
say
that
I’m
the
king,
or
there
will
be
no
mercy
for
him.”

“He
will,”
Sansa
said,
heart
soaring.
“Oh,
I
know
he
will.”





EDDARD

The
straw
on
the
floor
stank
of
urine.
There
was
no
window,
no
bed,
not
even
a
slop
bucket.
He
remembered
walls
of
pale
red
stone
festooned
with
patches
of
nitre,
a
grey
door
of
splintered
wood,
four
inches
thick
and
studded
with
iron.
He
had
seen
them,
briefly,
a
quick
glimpse
as
they
shoved
him
inside.
Once
the
door
had
slammed
shut,
he
had
seen
no
more.
The
dark
was
absolute.
He
had
as
well
been
blind.

Or
dead.
Buried
with
his
king.
“Ah,
Robert,”
he
murmured
as
his
groping
hand
touched
a
cold
stone
wall,
his
leg
throbbing
with
every
motion.
He
remembered
the
jest
the
king
had
shared
in
the
crypts
of
Winterfell,
as
the
Kings
of
Winter
looked
on
with
cold
stone
eyes.
The
king
eats,
Robert
had
said,
and
the
Hand
takes
the
shit.
How
he
had
laughed.
Yet
he
had
gotten
it
wrong.
The
king
dies,
Ned
Stark
thought,
and
the
Hand
is
buried.

The
dungeon
was
under
the
Red
Keep,
deeper
than
he
dared
imagine.
He
remembered
the
old
stories
about
Maegor
the
Cruel,
who
murdered
all
the
masons
who
labored
on
his
castle,
so
they
might
never
reveal
its
secrets.

He
damned
them
all:
Littlefinger,
Janos
Slynt
and
his
gold
cloaks,
the
queen,
the
Kingslayer,
Pycelle
and
Varys
and
Ser
Barristan,
even
Lord
Renly,
Robert’s
own
blood,
who
had
run
when
he
was
needed
most.
Yet
in
the
end
he
blamed
himself.
“Fool,”
he
cried
to
the
darkness,
“thrice-damned
blind
fool.”

Cersei
Lannister’s
face
seemed
to
float
before
him
in
the
darkness.
Her
hair
was
full
of
sunlight,
but
there
was
mockery
in
her
smile.
“When
you
play
the
game
of
thrones,
you
win
or
you
die,”
she
whispered.
Ned
had
played
and
lost,
and
his
men
had
paid
the
price
of
his
folly
with
their
life’s
blood.

When
he
thought
of
his
daughters,
he
would
have
wept
gladly,
but
the
tears
would
not
come.
Even
now,
he
was
a
Stark
of
Winterfell,
and
his
grief
and
his
rage
froze
hard
inside
him.

When
he
kept
very
still,
his
leg
did
not
hurt
so
much,
so
he
did
his
best
to
lie
unmoving.
For
how
long
he
could
not
say.
There
was
no
sun
and
no
moon.
He
could
not
see
to
mark
the
walls.
Ned
closed
his
eyes
and
opened
them;
it
made
no
difference.
He
slept
and
woke
and
slept
again.
He
did
not
know
which
was
more
painful,
the
waking
or
the
sleeping.
When
he
slept,
he
dreamed:
dark
disturbing
dreams
of
blood
and
broken
promises.
When
he
woke,
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
think,
and
his
waking
thoughts
were
worse
than
nightmares.
The
thought
of
Cat
was
as
painful
as
a
bed
of
nettles.
He
wondered
where
she
was,
what
she
was
doing.
He
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
see
her
again.

Hours
turned
to
days,
or
so
it
seemed.
He
could
feel
a
dull
ache
in
his
shattered
leg,
an
itch
beneath
the
plaster.
When
he
touched
his
thigh,
the
flesh
was
hot
to
his
fingers.
The
only
sound
was
his
breathing.
After
a
time,
he
began
to
talk
aloud,
just
to
hear
a
voice.
He
made
plans
to
keep
himself
sane,
built
castles
of
hope
in
the
dark.
Robert’s
brothers
were
out
in
the
world,
raising
armies
at
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End.
Alyn
and
Harwin
would
return
to
King’s
Landing
with
the
rest
of
his
household
guard
once
they
had
dealt
with
Ser
Gregor.
Catelyn
would
raise
the
north
when
the
word
reached
her,
and
the
lords
of
river
and
mountain
and
Vale
would
join
her.

He
found
himself
thinking
of
Robert
more
and
more.
He
saw
the
king
as
he
had
been
in
the
flower
of
his
youth,
tall
and
handsome,
his
great
antlered
helm
on
his
head,
his
warhammer
in
hand,
sitting
his
horse
like
a
horned
god.
He
heard
his
laughter
in
the
dark,
saw
his
eyes,
blue
and
clear
as
mountain
lakes.
“Look
at
us,
Ned,”
Robert
said.
“Gods,
how
did
we
come
to
this?
You
here,
and
me
killed
by
a
pig.
We
won
a
throne
together…”

I
failed
you,
Robert,
Ned
thought.
He
could
not
say
the
words.
I
lied
to
you,
hid
the
truth.
I
let
them
kill
you.

The
king
heard
him.
“You
stiff-necked
fool,”
he
muttered,
“too
proud
to
listen.
Can
you
eat
pride,
Stark?
Will
honor
shield
your
children?”
Cracks
ran
down
his
face,
fissures
opening
in
the
flesh,
and
he
reached
up
and
ripped
the
mask
away.
It
was
not
Robert
at
all;
it
was
Littlefinger,
grinning,
mocking
him.
When
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak,
his
lies
turned
to
pale
grey
moths
and
took
wing.

Ned
was
half-asleep
when
the
footsteps
came
down
the
hall.
At
first
he
thought
he
dreamt
them;
it
had
been
so
long
since
he
had
heard
anything
but
the
sound
of
his
own
voice.
Ned
was
feverish
by
then,
his
leg
a
dull
agony,
his
lips
parched
and
cracked.
When
the
heavy
wooden
door
creaked
open,
the
sudden
light
was
painful
to
his
eyes.

A
gaoler
thrust
a
jug
at
him.
The
clay
was
cool
and
beaded
with
moisture.
Ned
grasped
it
with
both
hands
and
gulped
eagerly.
Water
ran
from
his
mouth
and
dripped
down
through
his
beard.
He
drank
until
he
thought
he
would
be
sick.
“How
long…?”
he
asked
weakly
when
he
could
drink
no
more.

The
gaoler
was
a
scarecrow
of
a
man
with
a
rat’s
face
and
frayed
beard,
clad
in
a
mail
shirt
and
a
leather
half
cape.
“No
talking,”
he
said
as
he
wrenched
the
jug
from
Ned’s
hands.

“Please,”
Ned
said,
“my
daughters…”
The
door
crashed
shut.
He
blinked
as
the
light
vanished,
lowered
his
head
to
his
chest,
and
curled
up
on
the
straw.
It
no
longer
stank
of
urine
and
shit.
It
no
longer
smelled
at
all.

He
could
no
longer
tell
the
difference
between
waking
and
sleeping.
The
memory
came
creeping
upon
him
in
the
darkness,
as
vivid
as
a
dream.
It
was
the
year
of
false
spring,
and
he
was
eighteen
again,
down
from
the
Eyrie
to
the
tourney
at
Harrenhal.
He
could
see
the
deep
green
of
the
grass,
and
smell
the
pollen
on
the
wind.
Warm
days
and
cool
nights
and
the
sweet
taste
of
wine.
He
remembered
Brandon’s
laughter,
and
Robert’s
berserk
valor
in
the
melee,
the
way
he
laughed
as
he
unhorsed
men
left
and
right.
He
remembered
Jaime
Lannister,
a
golden
youth
in
scaled
white
armor,
kneeling
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
king’s
pavilion
and
making
his
vows
to
protect
and
defend
King
Aerys.
Afterward,
Ser
Oswell
Whent
helped
Jaime
to
his
feet,
and
the
White
Bull
himself,
Lord
Commander
Ser
Gerold
Hightower,
fastened
the
snowy
cloak
of
the
Kingsguard
about
his
shoulders.
All
six
White
Swords
were
there
to
welcome
their
newest
brother.

Yet
when
the
jousting
began,
the
day
belonged
to
Rhaegar
Targaryen.
The
crown
prince
wore
the
armor
he
would
die
in:
gleaming
black
plate
with
the
three-headed
dragon
of
his
House
wrought
in
rubies
on
the
breast.
A
plume
of
scarlet
silk
streamed
behind
him
when
he
rode,
and
it
seemed
no
lance
could
touch
him.
Brandon
fell
to
him,
and
Bronze
Yohn
Royce,
and
even
the
splendid
Ser
Arthur
Dayne,
the
Sword
of
the
Morning.

Robert
had
been
jesting
with
Jon
and
old
Lord
Hunter
as
the
prince
circled
the
field
after
unhorsing
Ser
Barristan
in
the
final
tilt
to
claim
the
champion’s
crown.
Ned
remembered
the
moment
when
all
the
smiles
died,
when
Prince
Rhaegar
Targaryen
urged
his
horse
past
his
own
wife,
the
Dornish
princess
Elia
Martell,
to
lay
the
queen
of
beauty’s
laurel
in
Lyanna’s
lap.
He
could
see
it
still:
a
crown
of
winter
roses,
blue
as
frost.

Ned
Stark
reached
out
his
hand
to
grasp
the
flowery
crown,
but
beneath
the
pale
blue
petals
the
thorns
lay
hidden.
He
felt
them
clawing
at
his
skin,
sharp
and
cruel,
saw
the
slow
trickle
of
blood
run
down
his
fingers,
and
woke,
trembling,
in
the
dark.

Promise
me,
Ned,
his
sister
had
whispered
from
her
bed
of
blood.
She
had
loved
the
scent
of
winter
roses.

“Gods
save
me,”
Ned
wept.
“I
am
going
mad.”

The
gods
did
not
deign
to
answer.

Each
time
the
turnkey
brought
him
water,
he
told
himself
another
day
had
passed.
At
first
he
would
beg
the
man
for
some
word
of
his
daughters
and
the
world
beyond
his
cell.
Grunts
and
kicks
were
his
only
replies.
Later,
when
the
stomach
cramps
began,
he
begged
for
food
instead.
It
made
no
matter;
he
was
not
fed.
Perhaps
the
Lannisters
meant
for
him
to
starve
to
death.
“No,”
he
told
himself.
If
Cersei
had
wanted
him
dead,
he
would
have
been
cut
down
in
the
throne
room
with
his
men.
She
wanted
him
alive.
Weak,
desperate,
yet
alive.
Catelyn
held
her
brother;
she
dare
not
kill
him
or
the
Imp’s
life
would
be
forfeit
as
well.

From
outside
his
cell
came
the
rattle
of
iron
chains.
As
the
door
creaked
open,
Ned
put
a
hand
to
the
damp
wall
and
pushed
himself
toward
the
light.
The
glare
of
a
torch
made
him
squint.
“Food,”
he
croaked.

“Wine,”
a
voice
answered.
It
was
not
the
rat-faced
man;
this
gaoler
was
stouter,
shorter,
though
he
wore
the
same
leather
half
cape
and
spiked
steel
cap.
“Drink,
Lord
Eddard.”
He
thrust
a
wineskin
into
Ned’s
hands.

The
voice
was
strangely
familiar,
yet
it
took
Ned
Stark
a
moment
to
place
it.
“Varys?”
he
said
groggily
when
it
came.
He
touched
the
man’s
face.
“I’m
not…
not
dreaming
this.
You’re
here.”
The
eunuch’s
plump
cheeks
were
covered
with
a
dark
stubble
of
beard.
Ned
felt
the
coarse
hair
with
his
fingers.
Varys
had
transformed
himself
into
a
grizzled
turnkey,
reeking
of
sweat
and
sour
wine.
“How
did
you…
what
sort
of
magician
are
you?”

“A
thirsty
one,”
Varys
said.
“Drink,
my
lord.”

Ned’s
hands
fumbled
at
the
skin.
“Is
this
the
same
poison
they
gave
Robert?”

“You
wrong
me,”
Varys
said
sadly.
“Truly,
no
one
loves
a
eunuch.
Give
me
the
skin.”
He
drank,
a
trickle
of
red
leaking
from
the
corner
of
his
plump
mouth.
“Not
the
equal
of
the
vintage
you
offered
me
the
night
of
the
tourney,
but
no
more
poisonous
than
most,”
he
concluded,
wiping
his
lips.
“Here.”

Ned
tried
a
swallow.
“Dregs.”
He
felt
as
though
he
were
about
to
bring
the
wine
back
up.

“All
men
must
swallow
the
sour
with
the
sweet.
High
lords
and
eunuchs
alike.
Your
hour
has
come,
my
lord.”

“My
daughters…”

“The
younger
girl
escaped
Ser
Meryn
and
fled,”
Varys
told
him.
“I
have
not
been
able
to
find
her.
Nor
have
the
Lannisters.
A
kindness,
there.
Our
new
king
loves
her
not.
Your
older
girl
is
still
betrothed
to
Joffrey.
Cersei
keeps
her
close.
She
came
to
court
a
few
days
ago
to
plead
that
you
be
spared.
A
pity
you
couldn’t
have
been
there,
you
would
have
been
touched.”
He
leaned
forward
intently.
“I
trust
you
realize
that
you
are
a
dead
man,
Lord
Eddard?”

“The
queen
will
not
kill
me,”
Ned
said.
His
head
swam;
the
wine
was
strong,
and
it
had
been
too
long
since
he’d
eaten.
“Cat…
Cat
holds
her
brother…”

“The
wrong
brother,”
Varys
sighed.
“And
lost
to
her,
in
any
case.
She
let
the
Imp
slip
through
her
fingers.
I
expect
he
is
dead
by
now,
somewhere
in
the
Mountains
of
the
Moon.”

“If
that
is
true,
slit
my
throat
and
have
done
with
it.”
He
was
dizzy
from
the
wine,
tired
and
heartsick.

“Your
blood
is
the
last
thing
I
desire.”

Ned
frowned.
“When
they
slaughtered
my
guard,
you
stood
beside
the
queen
and
watched,
and
said
not
a
word.”

“And
would
again.
I
seem
to
recall
that
I
was
unarmed,
unarmored,
and
surrounded
by
Lannister
swords.”
The
eunuch
looked
at
him
curiously,
tilting
his
head.
“When
I
was
a
young
boy,
before
I
was
cut,
I
traveled
with
a
troupe
of
mummers
through
the
Free
Cities.
They
taught
me
that
each
man
has
a
role
to
play,
in
life
as
well
as
mummery.
So
it
is
at
court.
The
King’s
Justice
must
be
fearsome,
the
master
of
coin
must
be
frugal,
the
Lord
Commander
of
the
Kingsguard
must
be
valiant…
and
the
master
of
whisperers
must
be
sly
and
obsequious
and
without
scruple.
A
courageous
informer
would
be
as
useless
as
a
cowardly
knight.”
He
took
the
wineskin
back
and
drank.

Ned
studied
the
eunuch’s
face,
searching
for
truth
beneath
the
mummer’s
scars
and
false
stubble.
He
tried
some
more
wine.
This
time
it
went
down
easier.
“Can
you
free
me
from
this
pit?”

“I
could…
but
will
I?
No.
Questions
would
be
asked,
and
the
answers
would
lead
back
to
me.”

Ned
had
expected
no
more.
“You
are
blunt.”

“A
eunuch
has
no
honor,
and
a
spider
does
not
enjoy
the
luxury
of
scruples,
my
lord.”

“Would
you
at
least
consent
to
carry
a
message
out
for
me?”

“That
would
depend
on
the
message.
I
will
gladly
provide
you
with
paper
and
ink,
if
you
like.
And
when
you
have
written
what
you
will,
I
will
take
the
letter
and
read
it,
and
deliver
it
or
not,
as
best
serves
my
own
ends.”

“Your
own
ends.
What
ends
are
those,
Lord
Varys?”

“Peace,”
Varys
replied
without
hesitation.
“If
there
was
one
soul
in
King’s
Landing
who
was
truly
desperate
to
keep
Robert
Baratheon
alive,
it
was
me.”
He
sighed.
“For
fifteen
years
I
protected
him
from
his
enemies,
but
I
could
not
protect
him
from
his
friends.
What
strange
fit
of
madness
led
you
to
tell
the
queen
that
you
had
learned
the
truth
of
Joffrey’s
birth?”

“The
madness
of
mercy,”
Ned
admitted.

“Ah,”
said
Varys.
“To
be
sure.
You
are
an
honest
and
honorable
man,
Lord
Eddard.
Ofttimes
I
forget
that.
I
have
met
so
few
of
them
in
my
life.”
He
glanced
around
the
cell.
“When
I
see
what
honesty
and
honor
have
won
you,
I
understand
why.”

Ned
Stark
laid
his
head
back
against
the
damp
stone
wall
and
closed
his
eyes.
His
leg
was
throbbing.
“The
king’s
wine…
did
you
question
Lancel?”

“Oh,
indeed.
Cersei
gave
him
the
wineskins,
and
told
him
it
was
Robert’s
favorite
vintage.”
The
eunuch
shrugged.
“A
hunter
lives
a
perilous
life.
If
the
boar
had
not
done
for
Robert,
it
would
have
been
a
fall
from
a
horse,
the
bite
of
a
wood
adder,
an
arrow
gone
astray…
the
forest
is
the
abbatoir
of
the
gods.
It
was
not
wine
that
killed
the
king.
It
was
your
mercy.”

Ned
had
feared
as
much.
“Gods
forgive
me.”

“If
there
are
gods,”
Varys
said,
“I
expect
they
will.
The
queen
would
not
have
waited
long
in
any
case.
Robert
was
becoming
unruly,
and
she
needed
to
be
rid
of
him
to
free
her
hands
to
deal
with
his
brothers.
They
are
quite
a
pair,
Stannis
and
Renly.
The
iron
gauntlet
and
the
silk
glove.”
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“You
have
been
foolish,
my
lord.
You
ought
to
have
heeded
Littlefinger
when
he
urged
you
to
support
Joffrey’s
succession.”

“How…
how
could
you
know
of
that?”

Varys
smiled.
“I
know,
that’s
all
that
need
concern
you.
I
also
know
that
on
the
morrow
the
queen
will
pay
you
a
visit.”

Slowly
Ned
raised
his
eyes.
“Why?”

“Cersei
is
frightened
of
you,
my
lord…
but
she
has
other
enemies
she
fears
even
more.
Her
beloved
Jaime
is
fighting
the
river
lords
even
now.
Lysa
Arryn
sits
in
the
Eyrie,
ringed
in
stone
and
steel,
and
there
is
no
love
lost
between
her
and
the
queen.
In
Dorne,
the
Martells
still
brood
on
the
murder
of
Princess
Elia
and
her
babes.
And
now
your
son
marches
down
the
Neck
with
a
northern
host
at
his
back.”

“Robb
is
only
a
boy,”
Ned
said,
aghast.

“A
boy
with
an
army,”
Varys
said.
“Yet
only
a
boy,
as
you
say.
The
king’s
brothers
are
the
ones
giving
Cersei
sleepless
nights…
Lord
Stannis
in
particular.
His
claim
is
the
true
one,
he
is
known
for
his
prowess
as
a
battle
commander,
and
he
is
utterly
without
mercy.
There
is
no
creature
on
earth
half
so
terrifying
as
a
truly
just
man.
No
one
knows
what
Stannis
has
been
doing
on
Dragonstone,
but
I
will
wager
you
that
he’s
gathered
more
swords
than
seashells.
So
here
is
Cersei’s
nightmare:
while
her
father
and
brother
spend
their
power
battling
Starks
and
Tullys,
Lord
Stannis
will
land,
proclaim
himself
king,
and
lop
off
her
son’s
curly
blond
head…
and
her
own
in
the
bargain,
though
I
truly
believe
she
cares
more
about
the
boy.”

“Stannis
Baratheon
is
Robert’s
true
heir,”
Ned
said.
“The
throne
is
his
by
rights.
I
would
welcome
his
ascent.”

Varys
tsked.
“Cersei
will
not
want
to
hear
that,
I
promise
you.
Stannis
may
win
the
throne,
but
only
your
rotting
head
will
remain
to
cheer
unless
you
guard
that
tongue
of
yours.
Sansa
begged
so
sweetly,
it
would
be
a
shame
if
you
threw
it
all
away.
You
are
being
given
your
life
back,
if
you’ll
take
it.
Cersei
is
no
fool.
She
knows
a
tame
wolf
is
of
more
use
than
a
dead
one.”

“You
want
me
to
serve
the
woman
who
murdered
my
king,
butchered
my
men,
and
crippled
my
son?”
Ned’s
voice
was
thick
with
disbelief.

“I
want
you
to
serve
the
realm,”
Varys
said.
“Tell
the
queen
that
you
will
confess
your
vile
treason,
command
your
son
to
lay
down
his
sword,
and
proclaim
Joffrey
as
the
true
heir.
Offer
to
denounce
Stannis
and
Renly
as
faithless
usurpers.
Our
green-eyed
lioness
knows
you
are
a
man
of
honor.
If
you
will
give
her
the
peace
she
needs
and
the
time
to
deal
with
Stannis,
and
pledge
to
carry
her
secret
to
your
grave,
I
believe
she
will
allow
you
to
take
the
black
and
live
out
the
rest
of
your
days
on
the
Wall,
with
your
brother
and
that
baseborn
son
of
yours.”

The
thought
of
Jon
filled
Ned
with
a
sense
of
shame,
and
a
sorrow
too
deep
for
words.
If
only
he
could
see
the
boy
again,
sit
and
talk
with
him…
pain
shot
through
his
broken
leg,
beneath
the
filthy
grey
plaster
of
his
cast.
He
winced,
his
fingers
opening
and
closing
helplessly.
“Is
this
your
own
scheme,”
he
gasped
out
at
Varys,
“or
are
you
in
league
with
Littlefinger?”

That
seemed
to
amuse
the
eunuch.
“I
would
sooner
wed
the
Black
Goat
of
Qohor.
Littlefinger
is
the
second
most
devious
man
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
Oh,
I
feed
him
choice
whispers,
sufficient
so
that
he
thinks
I
am
his…
just
as
I
allow
Cersei
to
believe
I
am
hers.”

“And
just
as
you
let
me
believe
that
you
were
mine.
Tell
me,
Lord
Varys,
who
do
you
truly
serve?”

Varys
smiled
thinly.
“Why,
the
realm,
my
good
lord,
how
ever
could
you
doubt
that?
I
swear
it
by
my
lost
manhood.
I
serve
the
realm,
and
the
realm
needs
peace.”
He
finished
the
last
swallow
of
wine,
and
tossed
the
empty
skin
aside.
“So
what
is
your
answer,
Lord
Eddard?
Give
me
your
word
that
you’ll
tell
the
queen
what
she
wants
to
hear
when
she
comes
calling.”

“If
I
did,
my
word
would
be
as
hollow
as
an
empty
suit
of
armor.
My
life
is
not
so
precious
to
me
as
that.”

“Pity.”
The
eunuch
stood.
“And
your
daughter’s
life,
my
lord?
How
precious
is
that?”

A
chill
pierced
Ned’s
heart.
“My
daughter…”

“Surely
you
did
not
think
I’d
forgotten
about
your
sweet
innocent,
my
lord?
The
queen
most
certainly
has
not.”

“No,”
Ned
pleaded,
his
voice
cracking.
“Varys,
gods
have
mercy,
do
as
you
like
with
me,
but
leave
my
daughter
out
of
your
schemes.
Sansa’s
no
more
than
a
child.”

“Rhaenys
was
a
child
too.
Prince
Rhaegar’s
daughter.
A
precious
little
thing,
younger
than
your
girls.
She
had
a
small
black
kitten
she
called
Balerion,
did
you
know?
I
always
wondered
what
happened
to
him.
Rhaenys
liked
to
pretend
he
was
the
true
Balerion,
the
Black
Dread
of
old,
but
I
imagine
the
Lannisters
taught
her
the
difference
between
a
kitten
and
a
dragon
quick
enough,
the
day
they
broke
down
her
door.”
Varys
gave
a
long
weary
sigh,
the
sigh
of
a
man
who
carried
all
the
sadness
of
the
world
in
a
sack
upon
his
shoulders.
“The
High
Septon
once
told
me
that
as
we
sin,
so
do
we
suffer.
If
that’s
true,
Lord
Eddard,
tell
me…
why
is
it
always
the
innocents
who
suffer
most,
when
you
high
lords
play
your
game
of
thrones?
Ponder
it,
if
you
would,
while
you
wait
upon
the
queen.
And
spare
a
thought
for
this
as
well:
The
next
visitor
who
calls
on
you
could
bring
you
bread
and
cheese
and
the
milk
of
the
poppy
for
your
pain…
or
he
could
bring
you
Sansa’s
head.

“The
choice,
my
dear
lord
Hand,
is
entirely
yours.”





CATELYN

As
the
host
trooped
down
the
causeway
through
the
black
bogs
of
the
Neck
and
spilled
out
into
the
riverlands
beyond,
Catelyn’s
apprehensions
grew.
She
masked
her
fears
behind
a
face
kept
still
and
stern,
yet
they
were
there
all
the
same,
growing
with
every
league
they
crossed.
Her
days
were
anxious,
her
nights
restless,
and
every
raven
that
flew
overhead
made
her
clench
her
teeth.

She
feared
for
her
lord
father,
and
wondered
at
his
ominous
silence.
She
feared
for
her
brother
Edmure,
and
prayed
that
the
gods
would
watch
over
him
if
he
must
face
the
Kingslayer
in
battle.
She
feared
for
Ned
and
her
girls,
and
for
the
sweet
sons
she
had
left
behind
at
Winterfell.
And
yet
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
for
any
of
them,
and
so
she
made
herself
put
all
thought
of
them
aside.
You
must
save
your
strength
for
Robb,
she
told
herself.
He
is
the
only
one
you
can
help.
You
must
be
as
fierce
and
hard
as
the
north,
Catelyn
Tully.
You
must
be
a
Stark
for
true
now,
like
your
son.

Robb
rode
at
the
front
of
the
column,
beneath
the
flapping
white
banner
of
Winterfell.
Each
day
he
would
ask
one
of
his
lords
to
join
him,
so
they
might
confer
as
they
marched;
he
honored
every
man
in
turn,
showing
no
favorites,
listening
as
his
lord
father
had
listened,
weighing
the
words
of
one
against
the
other.
He
has
learned
so
much
from
Ned,
she
thought
as
she
watched
him,
but
has
he
learned
enough?

The
Blackfish
had
taken
a
hundred
picked
men
and
a
hundred
swift
horses
and
raced
ahead
to
screen
their
movements
and
scout
the
way.
The
reports
Ser
Brynden’s
riders
brought
back
did
little
to
reassure
her.
Lord
Tywin’s
host
was
still
many
days
to
the
south…
but
Walder
Frey,
Lord
of
the
Crossing,
had
assembled
a
force
of
near
four
thousand
men
at
his
castles
on
the
Green
Fork.

“Late
again,”
Catelyn
murmured
when
she
heard.
It
was
the
Trident
all
over,
damn
the
man.
Her
brother
Edmure
had
called
the
banners;
by
rights,
Lord
Frey
should
have
gone
to
join
the
Tully
host
at
Riverrun,
yet
here
he
sat.

“Four
thousand
men,”
Robb
repeated,
more
perplexed
than
angry.
“Lord
Frey
cannot
hope
to
fight
the
Lannisters
by
himself.
Surely
he
means
to
join
his
power
to
ours.”

“Does
he?”
Catelyn
asked.
She
had
ridden
forward
to
join
Robb
and
Robett
Glover,
his
companion
of
the
day.
The
vanguard
spread
out
behind
them,
a
slow-moving
forest
of
lances
and
banners
and
spears.
“I
wonder.
Expect
nothing
of
Walder
Frey,
and
you
will
never
be
surprised.”

“He’s
your
father’s
bannerman.”

“Some
men
take
their
oaths
more
seriously
than
others,
Robb.
And
Lord
Walder
was
always
friendlier
with
Casterly
Rock
than
my
father
would
have
liked.
One
of
his
sons
is
wed
to
Tywin
Lannister’s
sister.
That
means
little
of
itself,
to
be
sure.
Lord
Walder
has
sired
a
great
many
children
over
the
years,
and
they
must
needs
marry
someone.
Still…”

“Do
you
think
he
means
to
betray
us
to
the
Lannisters,
my
lady?”
Robett
Glover
asked
gravely.

Catelyn
sighed.
“If
truth
be
told,
I
doubt
even
Lord
Frey
knows
what
Lord
Frey
intends
to
do.
He
has
an
old
man’s
caution
and
a
young
man’s
ambition,
and
has
never
lacked
for
cunning.”

“We
must
have
the
Twins,
Mother,”
Robb
said
heatedly.
“There
is
no
other
way
across
the
river.
You
know
that.”

“Yes.
And
so
does
Walder
Frey,
you
can
be
sure
of
that.”

That
night
they
made
camp
on
the
southern
edge
of
the
bogs,
halfway
between
the
kingsroad
and
the
river.
It
was
there
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
them
further
word
from
her
uncle.
“Ser
Brynden
says
to
tell
you
he’s
crossed
swords
with
the
Lannisters.
There
are
a
dozen
scouts
who
won’t
be
reporting
back
to
Lord
Tywin
anytime
soon.
Or
ever.”
He
grinned.
“Ser
Addam
Marbrand
commands
their
outriders,
and
he’s
pulling
back
south,
burning
as
he
goes.
He
knows
where
we
are,
more
or
less,
but
the
Blackfish
vows
he
will
not
know
when
we
split.”

“Unless
Lord
Frey
tells
him,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“Theon,
when
you
return
to
my
uncle,
tell
him
he
is
to
place
his
best
bowmen
around
the
Twins,
day
and
night,
with
orders
to
bring
down
any
raven
they
see
leaving
the
battlements.
I
want
no
birds
bringing
word
of
my
son’s
movements
to
Lord
Tywin.”

“Ser
Brynden
has
seen
to
it
already,
my
lady,”
Theon
replied
with
a
cocky
smile.
“A
few
more
blackbirds,
and
we
should
have
enough
to
bake
a
pie.
I’ll
save
you
their
feathers
for
a
hat.”

She
ought
to
have
known
that
Brynden
Blackfish
would
be
well
ahead
of
her.
“What
have
the
Freys
been
doing
while
the
Lannisters
burn
their
fields
and
plunder
their
holdfasts?”

“There’s
been
some
fighting
between
Ser
Addam’s
men
and
Lord
Walder’s,”
Theon
answered.
“Not
a
day’s
ride
from
here,
we
found
two
Lannister
scouts
feeding
the
crows
where
the
Freys
had
strung
them
up.
Most
of
Lord
Walder’s
strength
remains
massed
at
the
Twins,
though.”

That
bore
Walder
Frey’s
seal
beyond
a
doubt,
Catelyn
thought
bitterly;
hold
back,
wait,
watch,
take
no
risk
unless
forced
to
it.

“If
he’s
been
fighting
the
Lannisters,
perhaps
he
does
mean
to
hold
to
his
vows,”
Robb
said.

Catelyn
was
less
encouraged.
“Defending
his
own
lands
is
one
thing,
open
battle
against
Lord
Tywin
quite
another.”

Robb
turned
back
to
Theon
Greyjoy.
“Has
the
Blackfish
found
any
other
way
across
the
Green
Fork?”

Theon
shook
his
head.
“The
river’s
running
high
and
fast.
Ser
Brynden
says
it
can’t
be
forded,
not
this
far
north.”

“I
must
have
that
crossing!”
Robb
declared,
fuming.
“Oh,
our
horses
might
be
able
to
swim
the
river,
I
suppose,
but
not
with
armored
men
on
their
backs.
We’d
need
to
build
rafts
to
pole
our
steel
across,
helms
and
mail
and
lances,
and
we
don’t
have
the
trees
for
that.
Or
the
time.
Lord
Tywin
is
marching
north…”
He
balled
his
hand
into
a
fist.

“Lord
Frey
would
be
a
fool
to
try
and
bar
our
way,”
Theon
Greyjoy
said
with
his
customary
easy
confidence.
“We
have
five
times
his
numbers.
You
can
take
the
Twins
if
you
need
to,
Robb.”

“Not
easily,”
Catelyn
warned
them,
“and
not
in
time.
While
you
were
mounting
your
siege,
Tywin
Lannister
would
bring
up
his
host
and
assault
you
from
the
rear.”

Robb
glanced
from
her
to
Greyjoy,
searching
for
an
answer
and
finding
none.
For
a
moment
he
looked
even
younger
than
his
fifteen
years,
despite
his
mail
and
sword
and
the
stubble
on
his
cheeks.
“What
would
my
lord
father
do?”
he
asked
her.

“Find
a
way
across,”
she
told
him.
“Whatever
it
took.”

The
next
morning
it
was
Ser
Brynden
Tully
himself
who
rode
back
to
them.
He
had
put
aside
the
heavy
plate
and
helm
he’d
worn
as
the
Knight
of
the
Gate
for
the
lighter
leather-and-mail
of
an
outrider,
but
his
obsidian
fish
still
fastened
his
cloak.

Her
uncle’s
face
was
grave
as
he
swung
down
off
his
horse.
“There
has
been
a
battle
under
the
walls
of
Riverrun,”
he
said,
his
mouth
grim.
“We
had
it
from
a
Lannister
outrider
we
took
captive.
The
Kingslayer
has
destroyed
Edmure’s
host
and
sent
the
lords
of
the
Trident
reeling
in
flight.”

A
cold
hand
clutched
at
Catelyn’s
heart.
“And
my
brother?”

“Wounded
and
taken
prisoner,”
Ser
Brynden
said.
“Lord
Blackwood
and
the
other
survivors
are
under
siege
inside
Riverrun,
surrounded
by
Jaime’s
host.”

Robb
looked
fretful.
“We
must
get
across
this
accursed
river
if
we’re
to
have
any
hope
of
relieving
them
in
time.”

“That
will
not
be
easily
done,”
her
uncle
cautioned.
“Lord
Frey
has
pulled
his
whole
strength
back
inside
his
castles,
and
his
gates
are
closed
and
barred.”

“Damn
the
man,”
Robb
swore.
“If
the
old
fool
does
not
relent
and
let
me
cross,
he’ll
leave
me
no
choice
but
to
storm
his
walls.
I’ll
pull
the
Twins
down
around
his
ears
if
I
have
to,
we’ll
see
how
well
he
likes
that!”

“You
sound
like
a
sulky
boy,
Robb,”
Catelyn
said
sharply.
“A
child
sees
an
obstacle,
and
his
first
thought
is
to
run
around
it
or
knock
it
down.
A
lord
must
learn
that
sometimes
words
can
accomplish
what
swords
cannot.”

Robb’s
neck
reddened
at
the
rebuke.
“Tell
me
what
you
mean,
Mother,”
he
said
meekly.

“The
Freys
have
held
the
crossing
for
six
hundred
years,
and
for
six
hundred
years
they
have
never
failed
to
exact
their
toll.”

“What
toll?
What
does
he
want?”

She
smiled.
“That
is
what
we
must
discover.”

“And
what
if
I
do
not
choose
to
pay
this
toll?”

“Then
you
had
best
retreat
back
to
Moat
Cailin,
deploy
to
meet
Lord
Tywin
in
battle…
or
grow
wings.
I
see
no
other
choices.”
Catelyn
put
her
heels
to
her
horse
and
rode
off,
leaving
her
son
to
ponder
her
words.
It
would
not
do
to
make
him
feel
as
if
his
mother
were
usurping
his
place.
Did
you
teach
him
wisdom
as
well
as
valor,
Ned?
she
wondered.
Did
you
teach
him
how
to
kneel?
The
graveyards
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
full
of
brave
men
who
had
never
learned
that
lesson.

It
was
near
midday
when
their
vanguard
came
in
sight
of
the
Twins,
where
the
Lords
of
the
Crossing
had
their
seat.

The
Green
Fork
ran
swift
and
deep
here,
but
the
Freys
had
spanned
it
many
centuries
past
and
grown
rich
off
the
coin
men
paid
them
to
cross.
Their
bridge
was
a
massive
arch
of
smooth
grey
rock,
wide
enough
for
two
wagons
to
pass
abreast;
the
Water
Tower
rose
from
the
center
of
the
span,
commanding
both
road
and
river
with
its
arrow
slits,
murder
holes,
and
portcullises.
It
had
taken
the
Freys
three
generations
to
complete
their
bridge;
when
they
were
done
they’d
thrown
up
stout
timber
keeps
on
either
bank,
so
no
one
might
cross
without
their
leave.

The
timber
had
long
since
given
way
to
stone.
The
Twins—two
squat,
ugly,
formidable
castles,
identical
in
every
respect,
with
the
bridge
arching
between—had
guarded
the
crossing
for
centuries.
High
curtain
walls,
deep
moats,
and
heavy
oak-and-iron
gates
protected
the
approaches,
the
bridge
footings
rose
from
within
stout
inner
keeps,
there
was
a
barbican
and
portcullis
on
either
bank,
and
the
Water
Tower
defended
the
span
itself.

One
glance
was
sufficient
to
tell
Catelyn
that
the
castle
would
not
be
taken
by
storm.
The
battlements
bristled
with
spears
and
swords
and
scorpions,
there
was
an
archer
at
every
crenel
and
arrow
slit,
the
drawbridge
was
up,
the
portcullis
down,
the
gates
closed
and
barred.

The
Greatjon
began
to
curse
and
swear
as
soon
as
he
saw
what
awaited
them.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark
glowered
in
silence.
“That
cannot
be
assaulted,
my
lords,”
Roose
Bolton
announced.

“Nor
can
we
take
it
by
siege,
without
an
army
on
the
far
bank
to
invest
the
other
castle,”
Helman
Tallhart
said
gloomily.
Across
the
deep-running
green
waters,
the
western
twin
stood
like
a
reflection
of
its
eastern
brother.
“Even
if
we
had
the
time.
Which,
to
be
sure,
we
do
not.”

As
the
northern
lords
studied
the
castle,
a
sally
port
opened,
a
plank
bridge
slid
across
the
moat,
and
a
dozen
knights
rode
forth
to
confront
them,
led
by
four
of
Lord
Walder’s
many
sons.
Their
banner
bore
twin
towers,
dark
blue
on
a
field
of
pale
silver-grey.
Ser
Stevron
Frey,
Lord
Walder’s
heir,
spoke
for
them.
The
Freys
all
looked
like
weasels;
Ser
Stevron,
past
sixty
with
grandchildren
of
his
own,
looked
like
an
especially
old
and
tired
weasel,
yet
he
was
polite
enough.
“My
lord
father
has
sent
me
to
greet
you,
and
inquire
as
to
who
leads
this
mighty
host.”

“I
do.”
Robb
spurred
his
horse
forward.
He
was
in
his
armor,
with
the
direwolf
shield
of
Winterfell
strapped
to
his
saddle
and
Grey
Wind
padding
by
his
side.

The
old
knight
looked
at
her
son
with
a
faint
flicker
of
amusement
in
his
watery
grey
eyes,
though
his
gelding
whickered
uneasily
and
sidled
away
from
the
direwolf.
“My
lord
father
would
be
most
honored
if
you
would
share
meat
and
mead
with
him
in
the
castle
and
explain
your
purpose
here.”

His
words
crashed
among
the
lords
bannermen
like
a
great
stone
from
a
catapult.
Not
one
of
them
approved.
They
cursed,
argued,
shouted
down
each
other.

“You
must
not
do
this,
my
lord,”
Galbart
Glover
pleaded
with
Robb.
“Lord
Walder
is
not
to
be
trusted.”

Roose
Bolton
nodded.
“Go
in
there
alone
and
you’re
his.
He
can
sell
you
to
the
Lannisters,
throw
you
in
a
dungeon,
or
slit
your
throat,
as
he
likes.”

“If
he
wants
to
talk
to
us,
let
him
open
his
gates,
and
we
will
all
share
his
meat
and
mead,”
declared
Ser
Wendel
Manderly.

“Or
let
him
come
out
and
treat
with
Robb
here,
in
plain
sight
of
his
men
and
ours,”
suggested
his
brother,
Ser
Wylis.

Catelyn
Stark
shared
all
their
doubts,
but
she
had
only
to
glance
at
Ser
Stevron
to
see
that
he
was
not
pleased
by
what
he
was
hearing.
A
few
more
words
and
the
chance
would
be
lost.
She
had
to
act,
and
quickly.
“I
will
go,”
she
said
loudly.

“You,
my
lady?”
The
Greatjon
furrowed
his
brow.

“Mother,
are
you
certain?”
Clearly,
Robb
was
not.

“Never
more,”
Catelyn
lied
glibly.
“Lord
Walder
is
my
father’s
bannerman.
I
have
known
him
since
I
was
a
girl.
He
would
never
offer
me
any
harm.”
Unless
he
saw
some
profit
in
it,
she
added
silently,
but
some
truths
did
not
bear
saying,
and
some
lies
were
necessary.

“I
am
certain
my
lord
father
would
be
pleased
to
speak
to
the
Lady
Catelyn,”
Ser
Stevron
said.
“To
vouchsafe
for
our
good
intentions,
my
brother
Ser
Perwyn
will
remain
here
until
she
is
safely
returned
to
you.”

“He
shall
be
our
honored
guest,”
said
Robb.
Ser
Perwyn,
the
youngest
of
the
four
Freys
in
the
party,
dismounted
and
handed
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
a
brother.
“I
require
my
lady
mother’s
return
by
evenfall,
Ser
Stevron,”
Robb
went
on.
“It
is
not
my
intent
to
linger
here
long.”

Ser
Stevron
Frey
gave
a
polite
nod.
“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
Catelyn
spurred
her
horse
forward
and
did
not
look
back.
Lord
Walder’s
sons
and
envoys
fell
in
around
her.

Her
father
had
once
said
of
Walder
Frey
that
he
was
the
only
lord
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
could
field
an
army
out
of
his
breeches.
When
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing
welcomed
Catelyn
in
the
great
hall
of
the
east
castle,
surrounded
by
twenty
living
sons
(minus
Ser
Perwyn,
who
would
have
made
twenty-one),
thirty-six
grandsons,
nineteen
great-grandsons,
and
numerous
daughters,
granddaughters,
bastards,
and
grandbastards,
she
understood
just
what
he
had
meant.

Lord
Walder
was
ninety,
a
wizened
pink
weasel
with
a
bald
spotted
head,
too
gouty
to
stand
unassisted.
His
newest
wife,
a
pale
frail
girl
of
sixteen
years,
walked
beside
his
litter
when
they
carried
him
in.
She
was
the
eighth
Lady
Frey.

“It
is
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
again
after
so
many
years,
my
lord,”
Catelyn
said.

The
old
man
squinted
at
her
suspiciously.
“Is
it?
I
doubt
that.
Spare
me
your
sweet
words,
Lady
Catelyn,
I
am
too
old.
Why
are
you
here?
Is
your
boy
too
proud
to
come
before
me
himself?
What
am
I
to
do
with
you?”

Catelyn
had
been
a
girl
the
last
time
she
had
visited
the
Twins,
but
even
then
Lord
Walder
had
been
irascible,
sharp
of
tongue,
and
blunt
of
manner.
Age
had
made
him
worse
than
ever,
it
would
seem.
She
would
need
to
choose
her
words
with
care,
and
do
her
best
to
take
no
offense
from
his.

“Father,”
Ser
Stevron
said
reproachfully,
“you
forget
yourself.
Lady
Stark
is
here
at
your
invitation.”

“Did
I
ask
you?
You
are
not
Lord
Frey
yet,
not
until
I
die.
Do
I
look
dead?
I’ll
hear
no
instructions
from
you.”

“This
is
no
way
to
speak
in
front
of
our
noble
guest,
Father,”
one
of
his
younger
sons
said.

“Now
my
bastards
presume
to
teach
me
courtesy,”
Lord
Walder
complained.
“I’ll
speak
any
way
I
like,
damn
you.
I’ve
had
three
kings
to
guest
in
my
life,
and
queens
as
well,
do
you
think
I
require
lessons
from
the
likes
of
you,
Ryger?
Your
mother
was
milking
goats
the
first
time
I
gave
her
my
seed.”
He
dismissed
the
red-faced
youth
>>>>>>> asd
with
a
flick
of
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
her
hand.
“Gyles
knew
of
our
dire
need
for
gold.
No
doubt
he
told
you
of
his
wish
to
leave
all
his
lands
and
wealth
to
Tommen.”
Rosby’s
gold
would
help
refresh
their
coffers,
and
Rosby’s
lands
and
castle
could
be
bestowed
upon
one
of
her
own
as
a
reward
for
leal
service.
Lord
Waters,
perhaps.
Aurane
had
been
hinting
at
his
need
for
a
seat;
his
lordship
was
only
an
empty
honor
without
one.
He
had
his
eye
on
Dragonstone,
Cersei
knew,
but
there
he
aimed
too
high.
Rosby
would
be
more
suitable
to
his
birth
and
station.

“Lord
Gyles
loved
His
Grace
with
all
his
heart,”
Pycelle
was
saying,
“but...
his
ward...”

“...will
doubtless
understand,
once
he
hears
you
speak
of
Lord
Gyles’s
dying
wish.
Go,
and
see
it
done.”

“If
it
please
Your
Grace.”
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
almost
tripped
over
his
own
robes
in
his
haste
to
leave.

Lady
Merryweather
closed
the
door
behind
him.
“Moon
tea,”
she
said,
as
she
turned
back
to
the
queen.
“How
foolish
of
her.
Why
would
she
do
such
a
thing,
take
such
a
risk?”

“The
little
queen
has
appetites
that
Tommen
is
as
yet
too
young
to
satisfy.”
That
was
always
a
danger,
when
a
grown
woman
was
married
to
a
child.
Even
more
so
with
a
widow.
She
may
claim
that
Renly
never
touched
her,
but
I
will
not
believe
it.
Women
only
drank
moon
tea
for
one
reason;
maidens
had
no
need
for
it
at
all.
“My
son
has
been
betrayed.
Margaery
has
a
lover.
That
is
high
treason,
punishable
by
death.”
She
could
only
hope
that
Mace
Tyrell’s
prune-faced
harridan
of
a
mother
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
trial.
By
insisting
that
Tommen
and
Margaery
be
wed
at
once,
Lady
Olenna
had
condemned
her
precious
rose
to
a
headsman’s
sword.
“Jaime
made
off
with
Ser
Ilyn
Payne.
I
suppose
I
shall
need
to
find
a
new
King’s
Justice
to
snick
her
head
off.”

“I’ll
do
it,”
offered
Osmund
Kettleblack,
with
an
easy
grin.
“Margaery’s
got
a
pretty
little
neck.
A
good
sharp
sword
will
go
right
through
it.”

“It
would,”
said
Taena,
“but
there
is
a
Tyrell
army
at
Storm’s
End
and
another
at
Maidenpool.
They
have
sharp
swords
as
well.”

I
am
awash
in
roses.
It
was
vexing.
She
still
had
need
of
Mace
Tyrell,
if
not
his
daughter.
At
least
until
such
time
as
Stannis
is
defeated.
Then
I
shan’t
need
any
of
them.
But
how
could
she
rid
herself
of
the
daughter
without
losing
the
father?
“Treason
is
treason,”
she
said,
“but
we
must
have
proof,
something
more
substantial
than
moon
tea.
If
she
is
proved
to
be
untrue,
even
her
own
lord
father
must
condemn
her,
or
her
shame
becomes
his
own.”

Kettleblack
chewed
on
one
end
of
his
mustache.
“We
need
to
catch
them
during
the
deed.”

“How?
Qyburn
has
eyes
on
her
day
and
night.
Her
serving
men
take
my
coin,
but
bring
us
only
trifles.
Yet
no
one
has
seen
this
lover.
The
ears
outside
her
door
hear
singing,
laughter,
gossip,
nothing
of
any
use.”

“Margaery
is
too
shrewd
to
be
caught
so
easily,”
said
Lady
Merryweather.
“Her
women
are
her
castle
walls.
They
sleep
with
her,
dress
her,
pray
with
her,
read
with
her,
sew
with
her.
When
she
is
not
hawking
or
riding
she
is
playing
come-into-my-castle
with
little
Alysanne
Bulwer.
Whenever
men
are
about,
her
septa
will
be
with
her,
or
her
cousins.”

“She
must
rid
herself
of
her
hens
sometime,”
the
queen
insisted.
A
thought
struck
her.
“Unless
her
ladies
are
part
of
it
as
well...
not
all
of
them,
perhaps,
but
some.”

“The
cousins?”
Even
Taena
sounded
doubtful.
“All
three
are
younger
than
the
little
queen,
and
more
innocent.”

“Wantons
clad
in
maiden’s
white.
That
only
makes
their
sins
more
shocking.
Their
names
will
live
in
shame.”
Suddenly
the
queen
could
almost
taste
it.
“Taena,
your
lord
husband
is
my
justiciar.
The
two
of
you
must
sup
with
me,
this
very
night.”
She
wanted
this
done
quickly,
before
Margaery
took
it
in
her
little
head
to
return
to
Highgarden,
or
sail
to
Dragonstone
to
be
with
her
wounded
brother
at
death’s
door.
“I
shall
command
the
cooks
to
roast
a
boar
for
us.
And
of
course
we
must
have
some
music,
to
help
with
our
digestion.”

Taena
was
very
quick.
“Music.
Just
so.”

“Go
and
tell
your
lord
husband
and
make
arrangements
for
the
singer,”
Cersei
urged.
“Ser
Osmund,
you
may
remain.
We
have
much
and
more
to
discuss.
I
shall
have
need
of
Qyburn
too.”

Sad
to
say,
the
kitchens
proved
to
have
no
wild
boar
on
hand,
and
there
was
not
time
enough
to
send
out
hunters.
Instead,
the
cooks
butchered
one
of
the
castle
sows,
and
served
them
ham
studded
with
cloves
and
basted
with
honey
and
dried
cherries.
It
was
not
what
Cersei
wanted,
but
she
made
do.
Afterward
they
had
baked
apples
with
a
sharp
white
cheese.
Lady
Taena
savored
every
bite.
Not
so
Orton
Merryweather,
whose
round
face
remained
blotched
and
pale
from
broth
to
cheese.
He
drank
heavily
and
kept
stealing
glances
at
the
singer.

“A
great
pity
about
Lord
Gyles,”
Cersei
said
at
last.
“I
daresay
none
of
us
will
miss
his
coughing,
though.”

“No.
No,
I’d
think
not.”

“We
shall
have
need
of
a
new
lord
treasurer.
If
the
Vale
were
not
so
unsettled,
I
would
bring
back
Petyr
Baelish,
but...
I
am
minded
to
try
Ser
Harys
in
the
office.
He
can
do
no
worse
than
Gyles,
and
at
least
he
does
not
cough.”

“Ser
Harys
is
the
King’s
Hand,”
said
Taena.

Ser
Harys
is
a
hostage,
and
feeble
even
at
that.
“It
is
time
that
Tommen
had
a
more
forceful
Hand.”

Lord
Orton
lifted
his
gaze
from
his
wine
cup.
“Forceful.
To
be
sure.”
He
hesitated.
“Who...?”

“You,
my
lord.
It
is
in
your
blood.
Your
grandsire
took
my
own
father’s
place
as
Hand
to
Aerys.”
Replacing
Tywin
Lannister
with
Owen
Merryweather
had
proved
to
be
akin
to
replacing
a
destrier
with
a
donkey,
to
be
sure,
but
Owen
had
been
an
old
done
man
when
Aerys
raised
him,
amiable
if
ineffectual.
His
grandson
was
younger,
and...
Well,
he
has
a
strong
wife.
It
was
a
pity
Taena
could
not
serve
as
Hand.
She
was
thrice
the
man
her
husband
was,
and
far
more
amusing.
She
was
also
Myrish-born
and
female,
however,
so
Orton
must
needs
suffice.
“I
have
no
doubt
that
you
are
more
able
than
Ser
Harys.”
The
contents
of
my
chamber
pot
are
more
able
than
Ser
Harys.
“Will
you
consent
to
serve?”

“I...
yes,
of
course.
Your
Grace
does
me
great
honor.”

A
greater
one
than
you
deserve.
“You
have
served
me
ably
as
justiciar,
my
lord.
And
will
continue
to
do
so
through
these...
trying
times
ahead.”
When
she
saw
that
Merryweather
had
grasped
her
meaning,
the
queen
turned
to
smile
at
the
singer.
“And
you
must
be
rewarded
as
well,
for
all
the
sweet
songs
you
have
played
for
us
whilst
we
ate.
The
gods
have
given
you
a
gift.”

The
singer
bowed.
“Your
Grace
is
kind
to
say
so.”

“Not
kind,”
said
Cersei,
“merely
truthful.
Taena
tells
me
that
you
are
called
the
Blue
Bard.”

“I
am,
Your
Grace.”
The
singer’s
boots
were
supple
blue
calfskin,
his
breeches
fine
blue
wool.
The
tunic
he
wore
was
pale
blue
silk
slashed
with
shiny
blue
satin.
He
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
dye
his
hair
blue,
in
the
Tyroshi
fashion.
Long
and
curly,
it
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
smelled
as
if
it
had
been
washed
in
rosewater.
From
blue
roses,
no
doubt.
At
least
his
teeth
are
white.
They
were
good
teeth,
not
the
least
bit
crooked.

“You
have
no
other
name?”

A
hint
of
pink
suffused
his
cheeks.
“As
a
boy,
I
was
called
Wat.
A
fine
name
for
a
plowboy,
less
fitting
for
a
singer.”

The
Blue
Bard’s
eyes
were
the
same
color
as
Robert’s.
For
that
alone,
she
hated
him.
“It
is
easy
to
see
why
you
are
Lady
Margaery’s
favorite.”

“Her
Grace
is
kind.
She
says
I
give
her
pleasure.”

“Oh,
I’m
certain
of
it.
Might
I
see
your
lute?”

“If
it
please
Your
Grace.”
Beneath
the
courtesy,
there
was
a
faint
hint
of
unease,
but
he
handed
her
the
lute
all
the
same.
One
does
not
refuse
the
queen’s
request.

Cersei
plucked
a
string
and
smiled
at
the
sound.
“Sweet
and
sad
as
love.
Tell
me,
Wat...
the
first
time
you
took
Margaery
to
bed,
was
that
before
she
wed
my
son,
or
after?”

For
a
moment
he
did
not
seem
to
understand.
When
he
did,
his
eyes
grew
large.
“Your
Grace
has
been
misinformed.
I
swear
to
you,
I
never—”

“Liar!”
Cersei
smashed
the
lute
across
the
singer’s
face
so
hard
the
painted
wood
exploded
into
shards
and
splinters.
“Lord
Orton,
summon
my
guards
and
take
this
creature
to
the
dungeons.”

Orton
Merryweather’s
face
was
damp
with
fear.
“This...
oh,
infamy...
he
dared
seduce
the
queen?”

“I
fear
it
was
the
other
way
around,
but
he
is
a
traitor
all
the
same.
Let
him
sing
for
Lord
Qyburn.”

The
Blue
Bard
went
white.
“No.”
Blood
dripped
from
his
lip
where
the
lute
had
torn
it.
“I
never...”
When
Merryweather
seized
him
by
the
arm,
he
screamed,
“Mother
have
mercy,
no.”

“I
am
not
your
mother,”
Cersei
told
him.

Even
in
the
black
cells,
all
they
got
from
him
were
denials,
prayers,
and
pleas
for
mercy.
Before
long,
blood
was
streaming
down
his
chin
from
all
his
broken
teeth,
and
he
wet
his
dark
blue
breeches
three
times
over,
yet
still
the
man
persisted
in
his
lies.
“Is
it
possible
we
have
the
wrong
singer?”
Cersei
asked.

“All
things
are
possible,
Your
Grace.
Have
no
fear.
The
man
will
confess
before
the
night
is
done.”
Down
here
in
the
dungeons,
Qyburn
wore
roughspun
wool
and
a
blacksmith’s
leather
apron.
To
the
Blue
Bard
he
said,
“I
am
sorry
if
the
guards
were
rough
with
you.
Their
courtesies
are
sadly
lacking.”
His
voice
was
kind,
solicitous.
“All
we
want
from
you
is
the
truth.”

“I’ve
told
you
the
truth,”
the
singer
sobbed.
Iron
shackles
held
him
hard
against
the
cold
stone
wall.

“We
know
better.”
Qyburn
had
a
razor
in
his
hand,
its
edge
gleaming
faintly
in
the
torchlight.
He
cut
away
the
Blue
Bard’s
clothing,
until
the
man
was
naked
but
for
his
high
blue
boots.
The
hair
between
his
legs
was
brown,
Cersei
was
amused
to
see.
“Tell
us
how
you
pleasured
the
little
queen,”
she
commanded.

“I
never...
I
sang,
was
all,
I
sang
and
played.
Her
ladies
will
tell
you.
They
were
always
with
us.
Her
cousins.”

“How
many
of
them
did
you
have
carnal
knowledge
of?”

“None
of
them.
I’m
just
a
singer.
Please.”

Qyburn
said,
“Your
Grace,
mayhaps
this
poor
man
only
played
for
Margaery
whilst
she
entertained
other
lovers.”

“No.
Please.
She
never...
I
sang,
I
only
sang...”

Lord
Qyburn
ran
a
hand
up
the
Blue
Bard’s
chest.
“Does
she
take
your
nipples
in
her
mouth
during
your
love
play?”
He
took
one
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger,
and
twisted.
“Some
men
enjoy
that.
Their
nipples
are
as
sensitive
as
a
woman’s.”
The
razor
flashed,
the
singer
shrieked.
On
his
chest
a
wet
red
eye
wept
blood.
Cersei
felt
ill.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
close
her
eyes,
to
turn
away,
to
make
it
stop.
But
she
was
the
queen
and
this
was
treason.
Lord
Tywin
would
not
have
turned
away.

In
the
end
the
Blue
Bard
told
them
his
whole
life,
back
to
his
first
name
day.
His
father
had
been
a
chandler
and
Wat
was
raised
to
that
trade,
but
as
a
boy
he
found
he
had
more
skill
at
making
lutes
than
barrels.
When
he
was
twelve
he
ran
off
to
join
a
troupe
of
musicians
he
had
heard
performing
at
a
fair.
He
had
wandered
half
the
Reach
before
coming
to
King’s
Landing
in
hopes
of
finding
favor
at
court.

“Favor?”
Qyburn
chuckled.
“Is
that
what
women
call
it
now?
I
fear
you
found
too
much
of
it,
my
friend...
and
from
the
wrong
queen.
The
true
one
stands
before
you.”

Yes.
Cersei
blamed
Margaery
Tyrell
for
this.
If
not
for
her,
Wat
might
have
lived
a
long
and
fruitful
life,
singing
his
little
songs
and
bedding
pig
girls
and
crofter’s
daughters.
Her
scheming
forced
this
on
me.
She
has
soiled
me
with
her
treachery.

By
dawn
the
singer’s
high
blue
boots
were
full
of
blood,
and
he
had
told
them
how
Margaery
would
fondle
herself
as
she
watched
her
cousins
pleasuring
him
with
their
mouths.
At
other
times
he
would
sing
for
her
whilst
she
sated
her
lusts
with
other
lovers.
“Who
were
they?”
the
queen
demanded,
and
the
wretched
Wat
named
Ser
Tallad
the
Tall,
Lambert
Turnberry,
Jalabhar
Xho,
the
Redwyne
twins,
Osney
Kettleblack,
Hugh
Clifton,
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers.

That
displeased
her.
She
dare
not
besmirch
the
name
of
the
hero
of
Dragonstone.
Besides,
no
one
who
knew
Ser
Loras
would
ever
believe
it.
The
Redwynes
could
not
be
a
part
of
it
either.
Without
the
Arbor
and
its
fleet,
the
realm
could
never
hope
to
rid
itself
of
this
Euron
Crow’s
Eye
and
his
accursed
ironmen.
“All
you
are
doing
is
spitting
up
the
names
of
men
you
saw
about
her
chambers.
We
want
the
truth!”

“The
truth.”
Wat
looked
at
her
with
the
one
blue
eye
that
Qyburn
had
left
him.
Blood
bubbled
through
the
holes
where
his
front
teeth
had
been.
“I
might
have...
misremembered.”

“Horas
and
Hobber
had
no
part
of
this,
did
they?”

“No,”
he
admitted.
“Not
them.”

“As
for
Ser
Loras,
I
am
certain
Margaery
took
pains
to
hide
what
she
was
doing
from
her
brother.”

“She
did.
I
remember
now.
Once
I
had
to
hide
under
the
bed
when
Ser
Loras
came
to
see
her.
He
must
never
know,
she
said.”

“I
prefer
this
song
to
the
other.”
Leave
the
great
lords
out
of
it,
that
was
for
the
best.
The
others,
though...
Ser
Tallad
had
been
a
hedge
knight,
Jalabhar
Xho
was
an
exile
and
a
beggar,
Clifton
was
the
only
one
of
the
little
queen’s
guardsman.
And
Osney
is
the
plum
that
makes
the
pudding.
“I
know
you
feel
better
for
having
told
the
truth.
You
will
want
to
remember
that
when
Margaery
comes
to
trial.
If
you
were
to
start
lying
again...”

“I
won’t.
I’ll
tell
it
true.
And
after...”

“...you
will
be
allowed
to
take
the
black.
You
have
my
word
on
that.”
Cersei
turned
to
Qyburn.
“See
that
his
wounds
are
cleaned
and
dressed,
and
give
him
milk
of
the
poppy
for
the
pain.”

“Your
Grace
is
good.”
Qyburn
dropped
the
bloody
razor
into
a
pail
of
vinegar.
“Margaery
may
wonder
where
her
bard
has
gone.”

“Singers
come
and
go,
they
are
infamous
for
it.”

The
climb
up
the
dark
stone
steps
from
the
black
cells
left
Cersei
feeling
breathless.
I
must
rest.
Getting
to
the
truth
was
wearisome
work,
and
she
dreaded
what
must
follow.
I
must
be
strong.
What
I
must
do
I
do
for
Tommen
and
the
realm.
It
was
a
pity
that
Maggy
the
Frog
was
dead.
Piss
on
your
prophecy,
old
woman.
The
little
queen
may
be
younger
than
I,
but
she
has
never
been
more
beautiful,
and
soon
she
will
be
dead.

Lady
Merryweather
was
waiting
in
her
bedchamber.
It
was
the
black
of
night,
closer
to
dawn
than
to
dusk.
Jocelyn
and
Dorcas
were
both
asleep,
but
not
Taena.
“Was
it
terrible?”
she
asked.

“You
cannot
know.
I
need
to
sleep,
but
fear
to
dream.”

Taena
stroked
her
hair.
“It
was
all
for
Tommen.”

“It
was.
I
know
it
was.”
Cersei
shuddered.
“My
throat
is
raw.
Be
a
sweet
and
pour
me
some
wine.”

“If
it
please
you.
That
is
all
that
I
desire.”

Liar.
She
knew
what
Taena
desired.
So
be
it.
If
the
woman
was
besotted
with
her,
that
would
help
ensure
that
she
and
her
husband
remained
loyal.
In
a
world
so
full
of
treachery,
that
was
worth
a
few
kisses.
She
is
no
worse
than
most
men.
At
least
there
is
no
danger
of
her
ever
getting
me
with
child.

The
wine
helped,
but
not
enough.
“I
feel
soiled,”
the
queen
complained
as
she
stood
beside
her
window,
cup
in
hand.

“A
bath
will
set
you
right,
my
sweet.”
Lady
Merryweather
woke
Dorcas
and
Jocelyn
and
sent
them
for
hot
water.
As
the
tub
was
filled,
she
helped
the
queen
disrobe,
undoing
her
laces
with
deft
fingers
and
easing
the
gown
off
her
shoulders.
Then
she
slipped
out
of
her
own
dress
and
let
it
puddle
on
the
floor.

The
two
of
them
shared
the
bath
together,
with
Cersei
lying
back
in
Taena’s
arms.
“Tommen
must
be
spared
the
worst
of
this,”
she
told
the
Myrish
woman.
“Margaery
still
takes
him
to
the
sept
every
day,
so
they
can
ask
the
gods
to
heal
her
brother.”
Ser
Loras
still
clung
to
life,
annoyingly.
“He
is
fond
of
her
cousins
as
well.
It
will
go
hard
on
him,
to
lose
them
all.”

“All
three
may
not
be
guilty,”
suggested
Lady
Merryweather.
“Why,
it
might
well
be
that
one
of
them
took
no
part.
If
she
was
shamed
and
sickened
by
the
things
she
saw...”

“...she
might
be
persuaded
to
bear
witness
against
the
others.
Yes,
very
good,
but
which
one
is
the
innocent?”

“Alla.”

“The
shy
one?”

“So
she
seems,
but
there
is
more
of
sly
than
shy
in
her.
Leave
her
to
me,
my
sweet.”

“Gladly.”
Alone,
the
Blue
Bard’s
confession
would
never
suffice.
Singers
lied
for
their
living,
after
all.
Alla
Tyrell
would
be
of
great
help,
if
Taena
could
deliver
her.
“Ser
Osney
shall
confess
as
well.
The
others
must
be
made
to
understand
that
only
through
confession
can
they
earn
the
king’s
forgiveness,
and
the
Wall.”
Jalabhar
Xho
would
find
the
truth
attractive.
About
the
rest
she
was
less
certain,
but
Qyburn
was
persuasive...

Dawn
was
breaking
over
King’s
Landing
when
they
climbed
from
the
tub.
The
queen’s
skin
was
white
and
wrinkled
from
her
long
immersion.
“Stay
with
me,”
she
told
Taena.
“I
do
not
want
to
sleep
alone.”
She
even
said
a
prayer
before
she
crawled
beneath
her
coverlet,
beseeching
the
Mother
for
sweet
dreams.

It
proved
a
waste
of
breath;
as
ever,
the
gods
were
deaf.
Cersei
dreamt
that
she
was
down
in
the
black
cells
once
again,
only
this
time
it
was
her
chained
to
the
wall
in
place
of
the
singer.
She
was
naked,
and
blood
dripped
from
the
tips
of
her
breasts
where
the
Imp
had
torn
off
her
nipples
with
his
teeth.
“Please,”
she
begged,
“please,
not
my
children,
do
not
harm
my
children.”
Tyrion
only
leered
at
her.
He
was
naked
too,
covered
with
coarse
hair
that
made
him
look
more
like
a
monkey
than
a
man.
“You
shall
see
them
crowned,”
he
said,
“and
you
shall
see
them
die.”
Then
he
took
her
bleeding
breast
into
his
mouth
and
began
to
suck,
and
pain
sawed
through
her
like
a
hot
knife.

She
woke
shuddering
in
Taena’s
arms.
“A
bad
dream,”
she
said
weakly.
“Did
I
scream?
I’m
sorry.”

“Dreams
turn
to
dust
in
light
of
day.
Was
it
the
dwarf
again?
Why
does
he
frighten
you
so,
this
silly
little
man?”

“He
is
going
to
kill
me.
It
was
foreseen
when
I
was
ten.
I
wanted
to
know
who
I
would
marry,
but
she
said...”

“She?”

“The
maegi.”
The
words
came
tumbling
out
of
her.
She
could
still
hear
Melara
Hetherspoon
insisting
that
if
they
never
spoke
about
the
prophecies,
they
would
not
come
true.
She
was
not
so
silent
in
the
well,
though.
She
screamed
and
shouted.
“Tyrion
is
the
valonqar,”
she
said.
“Do
you
use
that
word
in
Myr?
It’s
High
Valyrian,
it
means
little
brother.”
She
had
asked
Septa
Saranella
about
the
word,
after
Melara
drowned.

Taena
took
her
hand
and
stroked
it.
“This
was
a
hateful
woman,
old
and
sick
and
ugly.
You
were
young
and
beautiful,
full
of
life
and
pride.
She
lived
in
Lannisport,
you
said,
so
she
would
have
known
of
the
dwarf
and
how
he
killed
your
lady
mother.
This
creature
dared
not
strike
you,
because
of
who
you
were,
so
she
sought
to
wound
you
with
her
viper’s
tongue.”

Could
it
be?
Cersei
wanted
to
believe
it.
“Melara
died,
though,
just
as
she
foretold.
I
never
wed
Prince
Rhaegar.
And
Joffrey...
the
dwarf
killed
my
son
before
my
eyes.”

“One
son,”
said
Lady
Merryweather,
“but
you
have
another,
sweet
and
strong,
and
no
harm
will
ever
come
to
him.”

“Never,
whilst
I
live.”
Saying
it
helped
her
believe
that
it
was
so.
Dreams
turn
to
dust
in
light
of
day,
yes.
Outside
the
morning
sun
was
shining
through
a
haze
of
cloud.
Cersei
slipped
out
from
under
the
blankets.
“I
will
break
my
fast
with
the
king
this
morning.
I
want
to
see
my
son.”
All
I
do,
I
do
for
him.

Tommen
helped
restore
her
to
herself.
He
had
never
been
more
precious
to
her
than
he
was
that
morning,
chattering
about
his
kittens
as
he
dribbled
honey
onto
a
chunk
of
hot
black
bread
fresh
from
the
ovens.
“Ser
Pounce
caught
a
mouse,”
he
told
her,
“but
Lady
Whiskers
stole
it
from
him.”

I
was
never
so
sweet
and
innocent,
Cersei
thought.
How
can
he
ever
hope
to
rule
in
this
cruel
realm?
The
mother
in
her
wanted
only
to
protect
him;
the
queen
in
her
knew
he
must
grow
harder,
or
the
Iron
Throne
was
certain
to
devour
him.
“Ser
Pounce
must
learn
to
defend
his
rights,”
she
told
him.
“In
this
world
the
weak
are
always
the
victims
of
the
strong.”

The
king
considered
that,
licking
honey
off
his
fingers.
“When
Ser
Loras
comes
back
I’m
going
to
learn
to
fight
with
lance
and
sword
and
morningstar,
the
same
way
he
does.”

“You
will
learn
to
fight,”
the
queen
promised,
“but
not
from
Ser
Loras.
He
will
not
be
coming
back,
Tommen.”

“Margaery
says
he
will.
We
pray
for
him.
We
ask
for
the
Mother’s
mercy,
and
for
the
Warrior
to
give
him
strength.
Elinor
says
that
this
is
Ser
Loras’s
hardest
battle.”

She
smoothed
his
hair
back,
the
soft
golden
curls
that
reminded
her
so
much
of
Joff.
“Will
you
be
spending
the
afternoon
with
your
wife
and
her
cousins?”

“Not
today.
She
has
to
fast
and
purify
herself,
she
said.”

Fast
and
purify...
oh,
for
Maiden’s
Day.
It
had
been
years
since
Cersei
had
been
required
to
observe
that
particular
holy
day.
Thrice
wed,
yet
she
still
would
have
us
believe
she
is
a
maid.
Demure
in
white,
the
little
queen
would
lead
her
hens
to
Baelor’s
Sept
to
light
tall
white
candles
at
the
Maiden’s
feet
and
hang
parchment
garlands
about
her
holy
neck.
A
few
of
her
hens,
at
least.
On
Maiden’s
Day
widows,
mothers,
and
whores
alike
were
barred
from
the
septs,
along
with
men,
lest
they
profane
the
sacred
songs
of
innocence.
Only
virgin
maids
could...

“Mother?
Did
I
say
something
wrong?”

Cersei
kissed
her
son’s
brow.
“You
said
something
very
wise,
sweetling.
Now
run
along
and
play
with
your
kittens.”

Afterward
she
summoned
Ser
Osney
Kettleblack
to
her
solar.
He
came
in
sweaty
from
the
yard
and
swaggering,
and
as
he
took
a
knee
he
undressed
her
with
his
eyes,
the
way
he
always
did.

“Rise,
ser,
and
sit
here
next
to
me.
You
did
me
a
valiant
service
once,
but
now
I
have
a
harder
task
for
you.”

“Aye,
and
I
have
something
hard
for
you.”

“That
must
wait.”
She
traced
his
scars
lightly
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers.
“Do
you
recall
the
whore
who
gave
these
to
you?
I’ll
give
her
to
you
when
you
come
back
from
the
Wall.
Would
you
like
that?”

“It’s
you
I
want.”

That
was
the
right
answer.
“First
you
must
confess
your
treason.
A
man’s
sins
can
poison
his
soul
if
left
to
fester.
I
know
it
must
be
hard
for
you
to
live
with
what
you’ve
done.
It
is
past
time
that
you
rid
yourself
of
your
shame.”

“Shame?”
Osney
sounded
baffled.
“I
told
Osmund,
Margaery
just
teases.
She
never
lets
me
do
any
more
than...”

“It
is
chivalrous
of
you
to
protect
her,”
Cersei
broke
in,
“but
you
are
too
good
a
knight
to
go
on
living
with
your
crime.
No,
you
must
take
yourself
to
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
this
very
night
and
speak
with
the
High
Septon.
When
a
man’s
sins
are
so
black,
only
His
High
Holiness
himself
can
save
him
from
hell’s
torments.
Tell
him
how
you
bedded
Margaery
and
her
cousins.”

Osney
blinked.
“What,
the
cousins
too?”

“Megga
and
Elinor,”
she
decided,
“never
Alla.”
That
little
detail
would
make
the
whole
story
more
plausible.
“Alla
would
sit
weeping,
and
plead
with
the
others
to
stop
their
sinning.”

“Just
Megga
and
Elinor?
Or
Margaery
too?”

“Margaery,
most
certainly.
She
was
the
one
behind
it
all.”

She
told
him
all
she
had
in
mind.
As
Osney
listened,
apprehension
slowly
spread
across
his
face.
When
she
finished
he
said,
“After
you
cut
her
head
off,
I
want
to
take
that
kiss
she
never
gave
me.”

“You
may
take
all
the
kisses
you
like.”

“And
then
the
Wall?”

“For
just
a
little
while.
Tommen
is
a
forgiving
king.”

Osney
scratched
at
his
scarred
cheek.
“Usually
if
I
lie
about
some
woman,
it’s
me
saying
how
I
never
fucked
them
and
them
saying
how
I
did.
This...
I
never
lied
to
no
High
Septon
before.
I
think
you
go
to
some
hell
for
that.
One
o’
the
bad
ones.”

The
queen
was
taken
aback.
The
last
thing
she
expected
was
piety
from
a
Kettleblack.
“Are
you
refusing
to
obey
me?”

“No.”
Osney
touched
her
golden
hair.
“The
thing
is,
the
best
lies
have
some
truth
in
’em...
to
give
’em
flavor,
as
it
were.
And
you
want
me
to
go
tell
how
I
fucked
a
queen...”

She
almost
slapped
his
face.
Almost.
But
she
had
gone
too
far,
and
too
much
was
at
stake.
All
I
do,
I
do
for
Tommen.
She
turned
her
head
and
caught
Ser
Osney’s
hand
with
her
own,
kissing
his
fingers.
They
were
rough
and
hard,
callused
from
the
sword.
Robert
had
hands
like
that,
she
thought.

Cersei
wrapped
her
arms
about
his
neck.
“I
would
not
want
it
said
I
made
a
liar
of
you,”
she
whispered
in
a
husky
voice.
“Give
me
an
hour,
and
meet
me
in
my
bedchamber.”

“We
waited
long
enough.”
He
thrust
his
fingers
inside
the
bodice
of
her
gown
and
yanked,
and
the
silk
parted
with
a
ripping
sound
so
loud
that
Cersei
was
afraid
that
half
of
the
Red
Keep
must
have
heard
it.
“Take
off
the
rest
before
I
tear
that
too,”
he
said.
“You
can
keep
the
crown
on.
I
like
you
in
the
crown.”





THE
PRINCESS
IN
THE
TOWER

Hers
was
a
gentle
prison.

Arianne
took
solace
from
that.
Why
would
her
father
go
to
such
great
pains
to
provide
for
her
comfort
in
captivity
if
he
had
marked
her
for
a
traitor’s
death?
He
cannot
mean
to
kill
me,
she
told
herself
a
hundred
times.
He
does
not
have
it
in
him
to
be
so
cruel.
I
am
his
blood
and
seed,
his
heir,
his
only
daughter.
If
need
be,
she
would
throw
herself
beneath
the
wheels
of
his
chair,
admit
her
fault,
and
beg
him
for
his
pardon.
And
she
would
weep.
When
he
saw
tears
rolling
down
her
face,
he
would
forgive
her.

She
was
less
certain
whether
she
would
forgive
herself.

“Areo,”
she
had
pleaded
with
her
captor
during
the
long
dry
ride
from
the
Greenblood
back
to
Sunspear,
“I
never
wanted
the
girl
to
come
to
harm.
You
must
believe
me.”

Hotah
made
no
reply,
except
to
grunt.
Arianne
could
feel
his
anger.
Darkstar
had
escaped
him,
the
most
dangerous
of
all
her
little
group
of
plotters.
He
had
outraced
all
his
pursuers
and
vanished
into
the
deep
desert,
with
blood
upon
his
blade.

“You
know
me,
captain,”
Arianne
had
said,
as
the
leagues
rolled
past.
“You
have
known
me
since
I
was
little.
You
always
kept
me
safe,
as
you
kept
my
lady
mother
safe
when
you
came
with
her
from
Great
Norvos
to
be
her
shield
in
a
strange
land.
I
need
you
now.
I
need
your
help.
I
never
meant—”

“What
you
meant
does
not
matter,
little
princess,”
Areo
Hotah
said.
“Only
what
you
did.”
His
countenance
was
stony.
“I
am
sorry.
It
is
for
my
prince
to
command,
for
Hotah
to
obey.”

Arianne
expected
to
be
brought
before
her
father’s
high
seat
beneath
the
dome
of
leaded
glass
in
the
Tower
of
the
Sun.
Instead,
Hotah
delivered
her
to
the
Spear
Tower,
and
the
custody
of
her
father’s
seneschal
Ricasso
and
Ser
Manfrey
Martell,
the
castellan.
“Princess,”
Ricasso
said,
“you
will
forgive
an
old
blind
man
if
he
does
not
make
the
climb
with
you.
These
legs
are
not
equal
to
so
many
steps.
A
chamber
has
been
prepared
for
you.
Ser
Manfrey
shall
escort
you
there,
to
await
the
prince’s
pleasure.”

“The
prince’s
displeasure,
you
mean.
Will
my
friends
be
confined
here
as
well?”
Arianne
had
been
parted
from
Garin,
Drey,
and
the
others
after
capture,
and
Hotah
had
refused
to
say
what
would
be
done
with
them.
“That
is
for
the
prince
to
decide,”
was
all
the
captain
had
to
say
upon
the
subject.
Ser
Manfrey
proved
a
bit
more
forthcoming.
“They
were
taken
to
the
Planky
Town
and
will
be
conveyed
by
ship
to
Ghaston
Grey,
until
such
time
as
Prince
Doran
decides
their
fate.”

Ghaston
Grey
was
a
crumbling
old
castle
perched
on
a
rock
in
the
Sea
of
Dorne,
a
drear
and
dreadful
prison
where
the
vilest
of
criminals
were
sent
to
rot
and
die.
“Does
my
father
mean
to
kill
them?”
Arianne
could
not
believe
it.
“All
they
did
they
did
for
love
for
me.
If
my
father
must
have
blood,
it
should
be
mine.”

“As
you
say,
princess.”

“I
want
to
speak
with
him.”

“He
thought
you
might.”
Ser
Manfrey
took
her
arm
and
marched
her
up
the
steps,
up
and
up
until
her
breath
grew
short.
The
Spear
Tower
stood
a
hundred
and
a
half
feet
high,
and
her
cell
was
nearly
at
the
top.
Arianne
eyed
every
door
they
passed,
wondering
if
one
of
the
Sand
Snakes
might
be
locked
within.

When
her
own
door
had
been
closed
and
barred,
Arianne
explored
her
new
home.
Her
cell
was
large
and
airy,
and
did
not
lack
for
comforts.
There
were
Myrish
carpets
on
the
floor,
red
wine
to
drink,
books
to
read.
In
one
corner
stood
an
ornate
cyvasse
table
with
pieces
carved
of
ivory
and
onyx,
though
she
had
no
one
to
play
with
even
if
she
had
been
so
inclined.
She
had
a
featherbed
to
sleep
in,
and
a
privy
with
a
marble
seat,
sweetened
by
a
basketful
of
herbs.
This
high
up,
the
views
were
splendid.
One
window
opened
to
the
east,
so
she
could
watch
the
sun
rise
above
the
sea.
The
other
allowed
her
to
look
down
upon
the
Tower
of
the
Sun,
and
the
Winding
Walls
and
Threefold
Gate
beyond.

The
exploration
took
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
her
to
lace
a
pair
of
sandals,
but
at
least
it
served
to
keep
the
tears
at
bay
for
a
time.
Arianne
found
a
basin
and
a
flagon
of
cool
water
and
washed
her
hands
and
face,
but
no
amount
of
scrubbing
could
cleanse
her
of
her
grief.
Arys,
she
thought,
my
white
knight.
Tears
filled
her
eyes,
and
suddenly
she
was
weeping,
her
whole
body
wracked
by
sobs.
She
remembered
how
Hotah’s
heavy
axe
had
cleaved
through
his
flesh
and
bone,
the
way
his
head
had
gone
spinning
through
the
air.
Why
did
you
do
it?
Why
throw
your
life
away?
I
never
told
you
to,
I
never
wanted
that,
I
only
wanted...
I
wanted...
I
wanted...

That
night
she
cried
herself
to
sleep...
for
the
first
time,
if
not
the
last.
Even
in
her
dreams
she
found
no
peace.
She
dreamt
of
Arys
Oakheart
caressing
her,
smiling
at
her,
telling
her
that
he
loved
her...
but
all
the
while
the
quarrels
were
in
him
and
his
wounds
were
weeping,
turning
his
whites
to
red.
Part
of
her
knew
it
was
a
nightmare,
even
as
she
dreamt
it.
Come
morning
all
of
this
will
vanish,
the
princess
told
herself,
but
when
morning
came,
she
was
still
in
her
cell,
Ser
Arys
was
still
dead,
and
Myrcella...
I
never
wanted
that,
never.
I
meant
the
girl
no
harm.
All
I
wanted
was
for
her
to
be
a
queen.
If
we
had
not
been
betrayed...

“Someone
told,”
Hotah
had
said.
The
memory
still
made
her
angry.
Arianne
clung
to
that,
feeding
the
flame
within
her
heart.
Anger
was
better
than
tears,
better
than
grief,
better
than
guilt.
Someone
told,
someone
she
had
trusted.
Arys
Oakheart
had
died
because
of
that,
slain
by
the
traitor’s
whisper
as
much
as
by
the
captain’s
axe.
The
blood
that
had
streamed
down
Myrcella’s
face,
that
was
the
betrayer’s
work
as
well.
Someone
told,
someone
she
had
loved.
That
was
the
cruelest
cut
of
all.

She
found
a
cedar
chest
full
of
her
clothes
at
the
foot
of
her
bed,
so
she
stripped
out
of
the
travel-stained
garb
she
had
slept
in
and
donned
the
most
revealing
garments
she
could
find,
wisps
of
silk
that
covered
everything
and
hid
nothing.
Prince
Doran
might
treat
her
like
a
child,
but
she
refused
to
dress
like
one.
She
knew
such
garb
would
discomfit
her
father
when
he
came
to
chastise
her
for
making
off
with
Myrcella.
She
counted
on
it.
If
I
must
crawl
and
weep,
let
him
be
uncomfortable
as
well.

She
expected
him
that
day,
but
when
the
door
finally
opened
it
proved
to
be
only
the
servants
with
her
midday
meal.
“When
might
I
see
my
father?”
she
asked,
but
none
of
them
would
answer.
The
kid
had
been
roasted
with
lemon
and
honey.
With
it
were
grape
leaves
stuffed
with
a
mélange
of
raisins,
onions,
mushrooms,
and
fiery
dragon
peppers.
“I
am
not
hungry,”
Arianne
said.
Her
friends
would
be
eating
ship’s
biscuits
and
salt
beef
on
their
way
to
Ghaston
Grey.
“Take
this
away
and
bring
me
Prince
Doran.”
But
they
left
the
food,
and
her
father
did
not
come.
After
a
while,
hunger
weakened
her
resolve,
so
she
sat
and
ate.

Once
the
food
was
gone,
there
was
nothing
else
for
Arianne
to
do.
She
paced
around
her
tower,
twice
and
thrice
and
three
times
thrice.
She
sat
beside
the
cyvasse
table
and
idly
moved
an
elephant.
She
curled
up
in
the
window
seat
and
tried
to
read
a
book,
until
the
words
became
a
blur
and
she
realized
that
she
was
crying
again.
Arys,
my
sweet,
my
white
knight,
why
did
you
do
it?
You
should
have
yielded.
I
tried
to
tell
you,
but
the
words
caught
in
my
mouth.
You
gallant
fool,
I
never
meant
for
you
to
die,
or
for
Myrcella...
oh,
gods
be
good,
that
little
girl...

Finally,
she
crawled
back
onto
the
featherbed.
The
world
had
grown
dark,
and
there
was
little
she
could
do
but
sleep.
Someone
told,
she
thought.
Someone
told.
Garin,
Drey,
and
Spotted
Sylva
were
friends
of
her
girlhood,
as
dear
to
her
as
her
cousin
Tyene.
She
could
not
believe
they
would
inform
on
her...
but
that
left
only
Darkstar,
and
if
he
was
the
betrayer,
why
had
he
turned
his
sword
on
poor
Myrcella?
He
wanted
to
kill
her
instead
of
crowning
her,
he
said
as
much
at
Shandystone.
He
said
that
was
how
I’d
get
the
war
I
wanted.
But
it
made
no
sense
for
Dayne
to
be
the
traitor.
If
Ser
Gerold
had
been
the
worm
in
the
apple,
why
would
he
have
turned
his
sword
upon
Myrcella?

Someone
told.
Could
it
have
been
Ser
Arys?
Had
the
white
knight’s
guilt
won
out
over
his
lust?
Had
he
loved
Myrcella
more
than
her
and
betrayed
his
new
princess
to
atone
for
his
betrayal
of
the
old?
Was
he
so
ashamed
of
what
he’d
done
that
he
threw
his
life
away
at
the
Greenblood
rather
than
live
to
face
dishonor?

Someone
told.
When
her
father
came
to
see
her,
she
would
learn
which
one.
Prince
Doran
did
not
come
the
next
day,
though.
Nor
the
day
after.
The
princess
was
left
alone
to
pace,
and
weep,
and
nurse
her
wounds.
During
the
daylight
hours
she
would
try
to
read,
but
the
books
that
they
had
given
her
were
deadly
dull:
ponderous
old
histories
and
geographies,
annotated
maps,
a
dry-as-dust
study
of
the
laws
of
Dorne,
The
Seven-Pointed
Star
and
Lives
of
the
High
Septons,
a
huge
tome
about
dragons
that
somehow
made
them
about
as
interesting
as
newts.
Arianne
would
have
given
much
and
more
for
a
copy
of
Ten
Thousand
Ships
or
The
Loves
of
Queen
Nymeria,
anything
to
occupy
her
thoughts
and
let
her
escape
her
tower
for
an
hour
or
two,
but
such
amusements
were
denied
her.

From
her
window
seat,
she
had
only
to
glance
out
to
see
the
great
dome
of
gold
and
colored
glass
below
her,
where
her
father
sat
in
state.
He
will
summon
me
soon,
she
told
herself.

No
visitors
were
permitted
her
beyond
the
servants;
Bors
with
his
stubbly
jaw,
tall
Timoth
dripping
dignity,
the
sisters
Morra
and
Mellei,
pretty
little
Cedra,
old
Belandra
who
had
been
her
mother’s
bedmaid.
They
brought
her
meals,
changed
her
bed,
and
emptied
the
chamber
pot
beneath
her
privy,
but
none
would
speak
with
her.
When
she
required
more
wine,
Timoth
would
fetch
it.
If
she
desired
some
favorite
food,
figs
or
olives
or
peppers
stuffed
with
cheese,
she
need
only
tell
Belandra,
and
it
would
appear.
Morra
and
Mellei
took
away
her
dirty
clothes
and
returned
them
clean
and
fresh.
Every
second
day
a
bath
was
brought
for
her,
and
shy
little
Cedra
would
soap
her
back
and
help
her
brush
her
hair.

Yet
none
of
them
had
a
word
for
her,
nor
would
they
deign
to
tell
her
what
was
happening
in
the
world
outside
her
sandstone
cage.
“Has
Darkstar
been
captured?”
she
asked
Bors
one
day.
“Are
they
still
hunting
for
him?”
The
man
only
turned
his
back
on
her
and
walked
away.
“Have
you
gone
deaf?”
Arianne
snapped
at
him.
“Come
back
here
and
answer
me.
I
command
it.”
Her
only
reply
was
the
sound
of
a
door
closing.

“Timoth,”
she
tried,
another
day,
“what
has
become
of
Princess
Myrcella?
I
never
meant
for
harm
to
come
to
her.”
The
last
she
had
seen
of
the
other
princess
had
been
on
their
ride
back
to
Sunspear.
Too
weak
to
sit
a
horse,
Myrcella
had
traveled
in
a
litter,
her
head
bound
up
in
silken
bandages
where
Darkstar
slashed
at
her,
her
green
eyes
bright
with
fever.
“Tell
me
that
she
has
not
died,
I
beg
you.
What
harm
could
come
of
my
knowing
that?
Tell
me
how
she
fares.”
Timoth
would
not.

“Belandra,”
Arianne
said,
a
few
days
later,
“if
you
ever
loved
my
lady
mother,
take
pity
on
her
poor
daughter
and
tell
me
when
my
father
means
to
come
and
see
me.
Please.
Please.”
But
Belandra
had
lost
her
tongue
as
well.

Is
this
my
father’s
notion
of
torment?
Not
hot
irons
or
the
rack,
but
simple
silence?
That
was
so
very
like
Doran
Martell
that
Arianne
had
to
laugh.
He
thinks
he
is
being
subtle
when
he
is
only
being
feeble.
She
resolved
to
enjoy
the
quiet,
to
use
the
time
to
heal
and
fortify
herself
for
what
must
come.

It
was
no
good
dwelling
endlessly
on
Ser
Arys,
she
knew.
Instead,
she
made
herself
think
about
the
Sand
Snakes,
Tyene
especially.
Arianne
loved
all
her
bastard
cousins,
from
prickly,
hot-tempered
Obara
to
little
Loreza,
the
youngest,
only
six
years
old.
Tyene
had
always
been
the
one
she
loved
the
most,
though;
the
sweet
sister
that
she
never
had.
The
princess
had
never
been
close
to
her
brothers;
Quentyn
was
off
at
Yronwood,
and
Trystane
was
too
young.
No,
it
had
always
been
her
and
Tyene,
with
Garin
and
Drey
and
Spotted
Sylva.
Nym
would
sometimes
join
them
in
their
sport,
and
Sarella
was
forever
pushing
in
where
she
didn’t
belong,
but
for
the
most
part
they
had
been
a
company
of
five.
They
splashed
in
the
pools
and
fountains
of
the
Water
Gardens,
and
rode
into
battle
perched
on
one
another’s
naked
backs.
She
and
Tyene
had
learned
to
read
together,
learned
to
ride
together,
learned
to
dance
together.
When
they
were
ten
Arianne
had
stolen
a
flagon
of
wine,
and
the
two
of
them
had
gotten
drunk
together.
They
shared
meals
and
beds
and
jewelry.
They
would
have
shared
their
first
man
as
well,
but
Drey
got
too
excited
and
spurted
all
over
Tyene’s
fingers
the
moment
she
drew
him
from
his
breeches.
Her
hands
are
dangerous.
The
memory
made
her
smile.

The
more
she
thought
about
her
cousins,
the
more
the
princess
missed
them.
For
all
I
know,
they
might
be
right
below
me.
That
night
Arianne
tried
pounding
on
the
floor
with
the
heel
of
her
sandal.
When
no
one
answered,
she
leaned
out
a
window
and
peered
down.
She
could
see
other
windows
below,
smaller
than
her
own,
some
no
more
than
arrow
loops.
“Tyene!”
she
called.
“Tyene,
are
you
there?
Obara,
Nym?
Can
you
hear
me?
Ellaria?
Anyone?
TYENE?”
The
princess
spent
half
the
night
hanging
out
the
window,
calling
till
her
throat
was
raw,
but
no
answering
shouts
came
back
to
her.
That
frightened
her
more
than
she
could
say.
If
the
Sand
Snakes
were
imprisoned
in
the
Spear
Tower,
they
surely
would
have
heard
her
shouting.
Why
didn’t
they
answer?
If
Father
has
done
them
harm,
I
will
never
forgive
him,
never,
she
told
herself.

By
the
time
a
fortnight
had
passed,
her
patience
had
worn
paper-thin.
“I
will
speak
with
my
father
now,”
she
told
Bors,
in
her
most
commanding
voice.
“You
will
take
me
to
him.”
He
did
not
take
her
to
him.
“I
am
ready
to
see
the
prince,”
she
told
Timoth,
but
he
turned
away
as
if
he
had
not
heard.
The
next
morning,
Arianne
was
waiting
beside
the
door
when
it
opened.
She
bolted
past
Belandra,
sending
a
platter
of
spiced
eggs
to
crash
against
the
wall,
but
the
guards
caught
her
before
she’d
gone
three
yards.
She
knew
them
too,
but
they
were
deaf
to
her
entreaties.
They
dragged
her
back
to
her
cell,
kicking
and
squirming.

Arianne
decided
that
she
must
needs
be
more
subtle.
Cedra
was
her
best
hope;
the
girl
was
young,
naive,
and
gullible.
Garin
had
boasted
of
bedding
her
once,
the
princess
recalled.
The
next
time
she
bathed,
as
Cedra
soaped
her
shoulders,
she
began
to
talk
of
everything
and
nothing.
“I
know
you
have
been
commanded
not
to
speak
to
me,”
she
said,
“but
no
one
told
me
not
to
speak
to
you.”
She
spoke
about
the
heat
of
the
day,
and
what
she’d
had
last
night
for
supper,
and
how
slow
and
stiff
poor
Belandra
was
becoming.
Prince
Oberyn
had
armed
each
of
his
daughters
so
they
need
never
be
defenseless,
but
Arianne
Martell
had
no
weapon
but
her
guile.
And
so
she
smiled
and
charmed,
and
asked
nothing
in
return
of
Cedra,
neither
word
nor
nod.

The
next
day
at
supper,
she
nattered
at
the
girl
again
as
she
was
serving.
This
time
she
contrived
to
mention
Garin.
Cedra
glanced
up
shyly
at
his
name
and
almost
spilled
the
wine
that
she
was
pouring.
So
it
is
that
way,
is
it?
thought
Arianne.

During
her
next
bath,
she
spoke
of
her
imprisoned
friends,
especially
Garin.
“He’s
the
one
I
fear
for
most,”
she
confided
to
the
serving
girl.
“The
orphans
are
free
spirits,
they
live
to
wander.
Garin
needs
sunshine
and
fresh
air.
If
they
lock
him
away
in
some
dank
stone
cell,
how
will
he
survive?
He
will
not
last
a
year
at
Ghaston
Grey.”
Cedra
did
not
reply,
but
her
face
was
pale
when
Arianne
rose
from
the
water,
and
she
was
squeezing
the
sponge
so
tightly
that
soap
was
dripping
on
the
Myrish
carpet.

Even
so,
it
was
four
more
days
and
two
more
baths
before
the
girl
was
hers.
“Please,”
Cedra
finally
whispered,
after
Arianne
had
painted
a
vivid
picture
of
Garin
throwing
himself
from
the
window
of
his
cell,
to
taste
freedom
one
last
time
before
he
died.
“You
have
to
help
him.
Please
don’t
let
him
die.”

“I
can
do
little
and
less
so
long
as
I
am
locked
up
here,”
she
whispered
back.
“My
father
will
not
see
me.
You
are
the
only
one
who
can
save
Garin.
Do
you
love
him?”

“Yes,”
Cedra
whispered,
blushing.
“But
how
can
I
help?”

“You
can
smuggle
out
a
letter
for
me,”
said
the
princess.
“Will
do
you
that?
Will
you
take
the
risk...
for
Garin?”

Cedra’s
eyes
got
big.
She
nodded.

I
have
a
raven,
Arianne
thought,
triumphantly,
but
who
to
send
her
to?
The
only
one
of
her
conspirators
to
escape
her
father’s
net
was
Darkstar.
By
now
Ser
Gerold
might
well
have
been
taken,
however;
if
not,
he
would
surely
have
fled
Dorne.
Her
next
thought
was
of
Garin’s
mother
and
the
orphans
of
the
Greenblood.
No,
not
them.
It
must
be
someone
with
real
power,
someone
who
had
no
part
of
our
plot
yet
might
have
reason
to
be
sympathetic
to
us.
She
considered
appealing
to
her
own
mother,
but
Lady
Mellario
was
far
away
in
Norvos.
Besides,
Prince
Doran
had
not
listened
to
his
lady
wife
for
many
years.
Not
her
either.
I
need
a
lord,
one
great
enough
to
cow
my
father
into
releasing
me.

The
most
powerful
of
the
Dornish
lords
was
Anders
Yronwood,
the
Bloodroyal,
Lord
of
Yronwood
and
Warden
of
the
Stone
Way,
but
Arianne
knew
better
than
to
look
for
help
from
the
man
who
had
fostered
her
brother
Quentyn.
No.
Drey’s
brother
Ser
Deziel
Dalt
had
once
aspired
to
marry
her,
but
he
was
much
too
dutiful
to
go
against
his
prince.
Besides,
whilst
the
Knight
of
Lemonwood
might
intimidate
a
petty
lord,
he
did
not
have
the
strength
to
sway
the
Prince
of
Dorne.
No.
The
same
was
true
of
Spotted
Sylva’s
father.
No.
Arianne
finally
decided
that
she
had
but
two
real
hopes:
Harmen
Uller,
Lord
of
Hellholt,
and
Franklyn
Fowler,
Lord
of
Skyreach
and
Warden
of
the
Prince’s
Pass.

Half
of
the
Ullers
are
half-mad,
the
saying
went,
and
the
other
half
are
worse.
Ellaria
Sand
was
Lord
Harmen’s
natural
daughter.
She
and
her
little
ones
had
been
locked
away
with
=======
his
fingers
and
gestured
to
two
of
his
other
sons.
“Danwell,
Whalen,
help
me
to
my
chair.”

They
shifted
Lord
Walder
from
his
litter
and
carried
him
to
the
high
seat
of
the
Freys,
a
tall
chair
of
black
oak
whose
back
was
carved
in
the
shape
of
two
towers
linked
by
a
bridge.
His
young
wife
crept
up
timidly
and
covered
his
legs
with
a
blanket.
When
he
was
settled,
the
old
man
beckoned
Catelyn
forward
and
planted
a
papery
dry
kiss
on
her
hand.
“There,”
he
announced.
“Now
that
I
have
observed
the
courtesies,
my
lady,
perhaps
my
sons
will
do
me
the
honor
of
shutting
their
mouths.
Why
are
you
here?”

“To
ask
you
to
open
your
gates,
my
lord,”
Catelyn
replied
politely.
“My
son
and
his
lords
bannermen
are
most
anxious
to
cross
the
river
and
be
on
their
way.”

“To
Riverrun?”
He
sniggered.
“Oh,
no
need
to
tell
me,
no
need.
I’m
not
blind
yet.
The
old
man
can
still
read
a
map.”

“To
Riverrun,”
Catelyn
confirmed.
She
saw
no
reason
to
deny
it.
“Where
I
might
have
expected
to
find
you,
my
lord.
You
are
still
my
father’s
bannerman,
are
you
not?”

“Heh,”
said
Lord
Walder,
a
noise
halfway
between
a
laugh
and
a
grunt.
“I
called
my
swords,
yes
I
did,
here
they
are,
you
saw
them
on
the
walls.
It
was
my
intent
to
march
as
soon
as
all
my
strength
was
assembled.
Well,
to
send
my
sons.
I
am
well
past
marching
myself,
Lady
Catelyn.”
He
looked
around
for
likely
confirmation
and
pointed
to
a
tall,
stooped
man
of
fifty
years.
“Tell
her,
Jared.
Tell
her
that
was
my
intent.”

“It
was,
my
lady,”
said
Ser
Jared
Frey,
one
of
his
sons
by
his
second
wife.
“On
my
honor.”

“Is
it
my
fault
that
your
fool
brother
lost
his
battle
before
we
could
march?”
He
leaned
back
against
his
cushions
and
scowled
at
her,
as
if
challenging
her
to
dispute
his
version
of
events.
“I
am
told
the
Kingslayer
went
through
him
like
an
axe
through
ripe
cheese.
Why
should
my
boys
hurry
south
to
die?
All
those
who
did
go
south
are
running
north
again.”

Catelyn
would
gladly
have
spitted
the
querulous
old
man
and
roasted
him
over
a
fire,
but
she
had
only
till
evenfall
to
open
the
bridge.
Calmly,
she
said,
“All
the
more
reason
that
we
must
reach
Riverrun,
and
soon.
Where
can
we
go
to
talk,
my
lord?”

“We’re
talking
now,”
Lord
Frey
complained.
The
spotted
pink
head
snapped
around.
“What
are
you
all
looking
at?”
he
shouted
at
his
kin.
“Get
out
of
here.
Lady
Stark
wants
to
speak
to
me
in
private.
Might
be
she
has
designs
on
my
fidelity,
heh.
Go,
all
of
you,
find
something
useful
to
do.
Yes,
you
too,
woman.
Out,
out,
out.”
As
his
sons
and
grandsons
and
daughters
and
bastards
and
nieces
and
nephews
streamed
from
the
hall,
he
leaned
close
to
Catelyn
and
confessed,
“They’re
all
waiting
for
me
to
die.
Stevron’s
been
waiting
for
forty
years,
but
I
keep
disappointing
him.
Heh.
Why
should
I
die
just
so
he
can
be
a
lord?
I
ask
you.
I
won’t
do
it.”

“I
have
every
hope
that
you
will
live
to
be
a
hundred.”

“That
would
boil
them,
to
be
sure.
Oh,
to
be
sure.
Now,
what
do
you
want
to
say?”

“We
want
to
cross,”
Catelyn
told
him.

“Oh,
do
you?
That’s
blunt.
Why
should
I
let
you?”

For
a
moment
her
anger
flared.
“If
you
were
strong
enough
to
climb
your
own
battlements,
Lord
Frey,
you
would
see
that
my
son
has
twenty
thousand
men
outside
your
walls.”

“They’ll
be
twenty
thousand
fresh
corpses
when
Lord
Tywin
gets
here,”
the
old
man
shot
back.
“Don’t
you
try
and
frighten
me,
my
lady.
Your
husband’s
in
some
traitor’s
cell
under
the
Red
Keep,
your
father’s
sick,
might
be
dying,
and
Jaime
Lannister’s
got
your
brother
in
chains.
What
do
you
have
that
I
should
fear?
That
son
of
yours?
I’ll
match
you
son
for
son,
and
I’ll
still
have
eighteen
when
yours
are
all
dead.”

“You
swore
an
oath
to
my
father,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.

He
bobbed
his
head
side
to
side,
smiling.
“Oh,
yes,
I
said
some
words,
but
I
swore
oaths
to
the
crown
too,
it
seems
to
me.
Joffrey’s
the
king
now,
and
that
makes
you
and
your
boy
and
all
those
fools
out
there
no
better
than
rebels.
If
I
had
the
sense
the
gods
gave
a
fish,
I’d
help
the
Lannisters
boil
you
all.”

“Why
don’t
you?”
she
challenged
him.

Lord
Walder
snorted
with
disdain.
“Lord
Tywin
the
proud
and
splendid,
Warden
of
the
West,
Hand
of
the
King,
oh,
what
a
great
man
that
one
is,
him
and
his
gold
this
and
gold
that
and
lions
here
and
lions
there.
I’ll
wager
you,
he
eats
too
many
beans,
he
breaks
wind
just
like
me,
but
you’ll
never
hear
him
admit
it,
oh,
no.
What’s
he
got
to
be
so
puffed
up
about
anyway?
Only
two
sons,
and
one
of
them’s
a
twisted
little
monster.
I’ll
match
him
son
for
son,
and
I’ll
still
have
nineteen
and
a
half
left
when
all
of
his
are
dead!”
He
cackled.
“If
Lord
Tywin
wants
my
help,
he
can
bloody
well
ask
for
it.”

That
was
all
Catelyn
needed
to
hear.
“I
am
asking
for
your
help,
my
lord,”
she
said
humbly.
“And
my
father
and
my
brother
and
my
lord
husband
and
my
sons
are
asking
with
my
voice.”

Lord
Walder
jabbed
a
bony
finger
at
her
face.
“Save
your
sweet
words,
my
lady.
Sweet
words
I
get
from
my
wife.
Did
you
see
her?
Sixteen
she
is,
a
little
flower,
and
her
honey’s
only
for
me.
I
wager
she
gives
me
a
son
by
this
time
next
year.
Perhaps
I’ll
make
him
heir,
wouldn’t
that
boil
the
rest
of
them?”

“I’m
certain
she
will
give
you
many
sons.”

His
head
bobbed
up
and
down.
“Your
lord
father
did
not
come
to
the
wedding.
An
insult,
as
I
see
it.
Even
if
he
is
dying.
He
never
came
to
my
last
wedding
either.
He
calls
me
the
Late
Lord
Frey,
you
know.
Does
he
think
I’m
dead?
I’m
not
dead,
and
I
promise
you,
I’ll
outlive
him
as
I
outlived
his
father.
Your
family
has
always
pissed
on
me,
don’t
deny
it,
don’t
lie,
you
know
it’s
true.
Years
ago,
I
went
to
your
father
and
suggested
a
match
between
his
son
and
my
daughter.
Why
not?
I
had
a
daughter
in
mind,
sweet
girl,
only
a
few
years
older
than
Edmure,
but
if
your
brother
didn’t
warm
to
her,
I
had
others
he
might
have
had,
young
ones,
old
ones,
virgins,
widows,
whatever
he
wanted.
No,
Lord
Hoster
would
not
hear
of
it.
Sweet
words
he
gave
me,
excuses,
but
what
I
wanted
was
to
get
rid
of
a
daughter.

“And
your
sister,
that
one,
she’s
full
as
bad.
It
was,
oh,
a
year
ago,
no
more,
Jon
Arryn
was
still
the
King’s
Hand,
and
I
went
to
the
city
to
see
my
sons
ride
in
the
tourney.
Stevron
and
Jared
are
too
old
for
the
lists
now,
but
Danwell
and
Hosteen
rode,
Perwyn
as
well,
and
a
couple
of
my
bastards
tried
the
melee.
If
I’d
known
how
they’d
shame
me,
I
would
never
have
troubled
myself
to
make
the
journey.
Why
did
I
need
to
ride
all
that
way
to
see
Hosteen
knocked
off
his
horse
by
that
Tyrell
whelp?
I
ask
you.
The
boy’s
half
his
age,
Ser
Daisy
they
call
him,
something
like
that.
And
Danwell
was
unhorsed
by
a
hedge
knight!
Some
days
I
wonder
if
those
two
are
truly
mine.
My
third
wife
was
a
Crakehall,
all
of
the
Crakehall
women
are
sluts.
Well,
never
mind
about
that,
she
died
before
you
were
born,
what
do
you
care?

“I
was
speaking
of
your
sister.
I
proposed
that
Lord
and
Lady
Arryn
foster
two
of
my
grandsons
at
court,
and
offered
to
take
their
own
son
to
ward
here
at
the
Twins.
Are
my
grandsons
unworthy
to
be
seen
at
the
king’s
court?
They
are
sweet
boys,
quiet
and
mannerly.
Walder
is
Merrett’s
son,
named
after
me,
and
the
other
one…
heh,
I
don’t
recall…
he
might
have
been
another
Walder,
they’re
always
naming
them
Walder
so
I’ll
favor
them,
but
his
father…
which
one
was
his
father
now?”
His
face
wrinkled
up.
“Well,
whoever
he
was,
Lord
Arryn
wouldn’t
have
him,
or
the
other
one,
and
I
blame
your
lady
sister
for
that.
She
frosted
up
as
if
I’d
suggested
selling
her
boy
to
a
mummer’s
show
or
making
a
eunuch
out
of
him,
and
when
Lord
Arryn
said
the
child
was
going
to
Dragonstone
to
foster
with
Stannis
Baratheon,
she
stormed
off
without
a
word
of
regrets
and
all
the
Hand
could
give
me
was
apologies.
What
good
are
apologies?
I
ask
you.”

Catelyn
frowned,
disquieted.
“I
had
understood
that
Lysa’s
boy
was
to
be
fostered
with
Lord
Tywin
at
Casterly
Rock.”

“No,
it
was
Lord
Stannis,”
Walder
Frey
said
irritably.
“Do
you
think
I
can’t
tell
Lord
Stannis
from
Lord
Tywin?
They’re
both
bungholes
who
think
they’re
too
noble
to
shit,
but
never
mind
about
that,
I
know
the
difference.
Or
do
you
think
I’m
so
old
I
can’t
remember?
I’m
ninety
and
I
remember
very
well.
I
remember
what
to
do
with
a
woman
too.
That
wife
of
mine
will
give
me
a
son
before
this
time
next
year,
I’ll
wager.
Or
a
daughter,
that
can’t
be
helped.
Boy
or
girl,
it
will
be
red,
wrinkled,
and
squalling,
and
like
as
not
she’ll
want
to
name
it
Walder
or
Walda.”

Catelyn
was
not
concerned
with
what
Lady
Frey
might
choose
to
name
her
child.
“Jon
Arryn
was
going
to
foster
his
son
with
Lord
Stannis,
you
are
quite
certain
of
that?”

“Yes,
yes,
yes,”
the
old
man
said.
“Only
he
died,
so
what
does
it
matter?
You
say
you
want
to
cross
the
river?”

“We
do.”

“Well,
you
can’t!”
Lord
Walder
announced
crisply.
“Not
unless
I
allow
it,
and
why
should
I?
The
Tullys
and
the
Starks
have
never
been
friends
of
mine.”
He
pushed
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
arms,
smirking,
waiting
for
her
answer.

The
rest
was
only
haggling.

A
swollen
red
sun
hung
low
against
the
western
hills
when
the
gates
of
the
castle
opened.
The
drawbridge
creaked
down,
the
portcullis
winched
up,
and
Lady
Catelyn
Stark
rode
forth
to
rejoin
her
son
and
his
lords
bannermen.
Behind
her
came
Ser
Jared
Frey,
Ser
Hosteen
Frey,
Ser
Danwell
Frey,
and
Lord
Walder’s
bastard
son
Ronel
Rivers,
leading
a
long
column
of
pikemen,
rank
on
rank
of
shuffling
men
in
blue
steel
ringmail
and
silvery
grey
cloaks.

Robb
galloped
out
to
meet
her,
with
Grey
Wind
racing
beside
his
stallion.
“It’s
done,”
she
told
him.
“Lord
Walder
will
grant
you
your
crossing.
His
swords
are
yours
as
well,
less
four
hundred
he
means
to
keep
back
to
hold
the
Twins.
I
suggest
that
you
leave
four
hundred
of
your
own,
a
mixed
force
of
archers
and
swordsmen.
He
can
scarcely
object
to
an
offer
to
augment
his
garrison…
but
make
certain
you
give
the
command
to
a
man
you
can
trust.
Lord
Walder
may
need
help
keeping
faith.”

“As
you
say,
Mother,”
Robb
answered,
gazing
at
the
ranks
of
pikemen.
“Perhaps…
Ser
Helman
Tallhart,
do
you
think?”

“A
fine
choice.”

“What…
what
did
he
want
of
us?”

“If
you
can
spare
a
few
of
your
swords,
I
need
some
men
to
escort
two
of
Lord
Frey’s
grandsons
north
to
Winterfell,”
she
told
him.
“I
have
agreed
to
take
them
as
wards.
They
are
young
boys,
aged
eight
years
and
seven.
It
would
seem
they
are
both
named
Walder.
Your
brother
Bran
will
welcome
the
companionship
of
lads
near
his
own
age,
I
should
think.”

“Is
that
all?
Two
fosterlings?
That’s
a
small
enough
price
to—”

“Lord
Frey’s
son
Olyvar
will
be
coming
with
us,”
she
went
on.
“He
is
to
serve
as
your
personal
squire.
His
father
would
like
to
see
him
knighted,
in
good
time.”

“A
squire.”
He
shrugged.
“Fine,
that’s
fine,
if
he’s—”

“Also,
if
your
sister
Arya
is
returned
to
us
safely,
it
is
agreed
that
she
will
marry
Lord
Walder’s
youngest
son,
Elmar,
when
the
two
of
them
come
of
age.”

Robb
looked
nonplussed.
“Arya
won’t
like
that
one
bit.”

“And
you
are
to
wed
one
of
his
daughters,
once
the
fighting
is
done,”
she
finished.
“His
lordship
has
graciously
consented
to
allow
you
to
choose
whichever
girl
you
prefer.
He
has
a
number
he
thinks
might
be
suitable.”

To
his
credit,
Robb
did
not
flinch.
“I
see.”

“Do
you
consent?”

“Can
I
refuse?”

“Not
if
you
wish
to
cross.”

“I
consent,”
Robb
said
solemnly.
He
had
never
seemed
more
manly
to
her
than
he
did
in
that
moment.
Boys
might
play
with
swords,
but
it
took
a
lord
to
make
a
marriage
pact,
knowing
what
it
meant.

They
crossed
at
evenfall
as
a
horned
moon
floated
upon
the
river.
The
double
column
wound
its
way
through
the
gate
of
the
eastern
twin
like
a
great
steel
snake,
slithering
across
the
courtyard,
into
the
keep
and
over
the
bridge,
to
issue
forth
once
more
from
the
second
castle
on
the
west
bank.

Catelyn
rode
at
the
head
of
the
serpent,
with
her
son
and
her
uncle
Ser
Brynden
and
Ser
Stevron
Frey.
Behind
followed
nine
tenths
of
their
horse;
knights,
lancers,
freeriders,
and
mounted
bowmen.
It
took
hours
for
them
all
to
cross.
Afterward,
Catelyn
would
remember
the
clatter
of
countless
hooves
on
the
drawbridge,
the
sight
of
Lord
Walder
Frey
in
his
litter
watching
them
pass,
the
glitter
of
eyes
peering
down
through
the
slats
of
the
murder
holes
in
the
ceiling
as
they
rode
through
the
Water
Tower.

The
larger
part
of
the
northern
host,
pikes
and
archers
and
great
masses
of
men-at-arms
on
foot,
remained
upon
the
east
bank
under
the
command
of
Roose
Bolton.
Robb
had
commanded
him
to
continue
the
march
south,
to
confront
the
huge
Lannister
army
coming
north
under
Lord
Tywin.

For
good
or
ill,
her
son
had
thrown
the
dice.





JON

“Are
you
well,
Snow?”
Lord
Mormont
asked,
scowling.

“Well,”
his
raven
squawked.
“Well.”

“I
am,
my
lord,”
Jon
lied…
loudly,
as
if
that
could
make
it
true.
“And
you?”

Mormont
frowned.
“A
dead
man
tried
to
kill
me.
How
well
could
I
be?”
He
scratched
under
his
chin.
His
shaggy
grey
beard
had
been
singed
in
the
fire,
and
he’d
hacked
it
off.
The
pale
stubble
of
his
new
whiskers
made
him
look
old,
disreputable,
and
grumpy.
“You
do
not
look
well.
How
is
your
hand?”

“Healing.”
Jon
flexed
his
bandaged
fingers
to
show
him.
He
had
burned
himself
more
badly
than
he
knew
throwing
the
flaming
drapes,
and
his
right
hand
was
swathed
in
silk
halfway
to
the
elbow.
At
the
time
he’d
felt
nothing;
the
agony
had
come
after.
His
cracked
red
skin
oozed
fluid,
and
fearsome
blood
blisters
rose
between
his
fingers,
big
as
roaches.
“The
maester
says
I’ll
have
scars,
but
otherwise
the
hand
should
be
as
good
as
it
was
before.”

“A
scarred
hand
is
nothing.
On
the
Wall,
you’ll
be
wearing
gloves
often
as
not.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.”
It
was
not
the
thought
of
scars
that
troubled
Jon;
it
was
the
rest
of
it.
Maester
Aemon
had
given
him
milk
of
the
poppy,
yet
even
so,
the
pain
had
been
hideous.
At
first
it
had
felt
as
if
his
hand
were
still
aflame,
burning
day
and
night.
Only
plunging
it
into
basins
of
snow
and
shaved
ice
gave
any
relief
at
all.
Jon
thanked
the
gods
that
no
one
but
Ghost
saw
him
writhing
on
his
bed,
whimpering
from
the
pain.
And
when
at
last
he
did
sleep,
he
dreamt,
and
that
was
even
worse.
In
the
dream,
the
corpse
he
fought
had
blue
eyes,
black
hands,
and
his
father’s
face,
but
he
dared
not
tell
Mormont
that.

“Dywen
and
Hake
returned
last
night,”
the
Old
Bear
said.
“They
found
no
sign
of
your
uncle,
no
more
than
the
others
did.”

“I
know.”
Jon
had
dragged
himself
to
the
common
hall
to
sup
with
his
friends,
and
the
failure
of
the
rangers’
search
had
been
all
the
men
had
been
talking
of.

“You
know,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“How
is
it
that
everyone
knows
everything
around
here?”
He
did
not
seem
to
expect
an
answer.
“It
would
seem
there
were
only
the
two
of…
of
those
creatures,
whatever
they
were,
I
will
not
call
them
men.
And
thank
the
gods
for
that.
Any
more
and…
well,
that
doesn’t
bear
thinking
of.
There
will
be
more,
though.
I
can
feel
it
in
these
old
bones
of
mine,
and
Maester
Aemon
agrees.
The
cold
winds
are
rising.
Summer
is
at
an
end,
and
a
winter
is
coming
such
as
this
world
has
never
seen.”

Winter
is
coming.
The
Stark
words
had
never
sounded
so
grim
or
ominous
to
Jon
as
they
did
now.
“My
lord,”
he
asked
hesitantly,
“it’s
said
there
was
a
bird
last
night…”

“There
was.
What
of
it?”

“I
had
hoped
for
some
word
of
my
father.”

“Father,”
taunted
the
old
raven,
bobbing
its
head
as
it
walked
across
Mormont’s
shoulders.
“Father.”

The
Lord
Commander
reached
up
to
pinch
its
beak
shut,
but
the
raven
hopped
up
on
his
head,
fluttered
its
wings,
and
flew
across
the
chamber
to
light
above
a
window.
“Grief
and
noise,”
Mormont
grumbled.
“That’s
all
they’re
good
for,
ravens.
Why
I
put
up
with
that
pestilential
bird…
if
there
was
news
of
Lord
Eddard,
don’t
you
think
I
would
have
sent
for
you?
Bastard
or
no,
you’re
still
his
blood.
The
message
concerned
Ser
Barristan
Selmy.
It
seems
he’s
been
removed
from
the
Kingsguard.
They
gave
his
place
to
that
black
dog
Clegane,
and
now
Selmy’s
wanted
for
treason.
The
fools
sent
some
watchmen
to
seize
him,
but
he
slew
two
of
them
and
escaped.”
Mormont
snorted,
leaving
no
doubt
of
his
view
of
men
who’d
send
gold
cloaks
against
a
knight
as
renowed
as
Barristan
the
Bold.
“We
have
white
shadows
in
the
woods
and
unquiet
dead
stalking
our
halls,
and
a
boy
sits
the
Iron
Throne,”
he
said
in
disgust.

The
raven
laughed
shrilly.
“Boy,
boy,
boy,
boy.”

Ser
Barristan
had
been
the
Old
Bear’s
best
hope,
Jon
remembered;
if
he
had
fallen,
what
chance
was
there
that
Mormont’s
letter
would
be
heeded?
He
curled
his
hand
into
a
fist.
Pain
shot
through
his
burned
fingers.
“What
of
my
sisters?”

“The
message
made
no
mention
of
Lord
Eddard
or
the
girls.”
He
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
“Perhaps
they
never
got
my
letter.
Aemon
sent
two
copies,
with
his
best
birds,
but
who
can
say?
More
like,
Pycelle
did
not
deign
to
reply.
It
would
not
be
the
first
time,
nor
the
last.
I
fear
we
count
for
less
than
nothing
in
King’s
Landing.
They
tell
us
what
they
want
us
to
know,
and
that’s
little
enough.”

And
you
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
know,
and
that’s
less,
Jon
thought
resentfully.
His
brother
Robb
had
called
the
banners
and
ridden
south
to
war,
yet
no
word
of
that
had
been
breathed
to
him…
save
by
Samwell
Tarly,
who’d
read
the
letter
to
Maester
Aemon
and
whispered
its
contents
to
Jon
that
night
in
secret,
all
the
time
saying
how
he
shouldn’t.
Doubtless
they
thought
his
brother’s
war
was
none
of
his
concern.
It
troubled
him
more
than
he
could
say.
Robb
was
marching
and
he
was
not.
No
matter
how
often
Jon
told
himself
that
his
place
was
here
now,
with
his
new
brothers
on
the
Wall,
he
still
felt
craven.

“Corn,”
the
raven
was
crying.
“Corn,
corn.”

“Oh,
be
quiet,”
the
Old
Bear
told
it.
“Snow,
how
soon
does
Maester
Aemon
say
you’ll
have
use
of
that
hand
back?”

“Soon,”
Jon
replied.

“Good.”
On
the
table
between
them,
Lord
Mormont
laid
a
large
sword
in
a
black
metal
scabbard
banded
with
silver.
“Here.
You’ll
be
ready
for
this,
then.”

The
raven
flapped
down
and
landed
on
the
table,
strutting
toward
the
sword,
head
cocked
curiously.
Jon
hesitated.
He
had
no
inkling
what
this
meant.
“My
lord?”

“The
fire
melted
the
silver
off
the
pommel
and
burnt
the
crossguard
and
grip.
Well,
dry
leather
and
old
wood,
what
could
you
expect?
The
blade,
now…
you’d
need
a
fire
a
hundred
times
as
hot
to
harm
the
blade.”
Mormont
shoved
the
scabbard
across
the
rough
oak
planks.
“I
had
the
rest
made
anew.
Take
it.”

“Take
it,”
echoed
his
raven,
preening.
“Take
it,
take
it.”

Awkwardly,
Jon
took
the
sword
in
hand.
His
left
hand;
his
bandaged
right
was
still
too
raw
and
clumsy.
Carefully
he
pulled
it
from
its
scabbard
and
raised
it
level
with
his
eyes.

The
pommel
was
a
hunk
of
pale
stone
weighted
with
lead
to
balance
the
long
blade.
It
had
been
carved
into
the
likeness
of
a
snarling
wolf’s
head,
with
chips
of
garnet
set
into
the
eyes.
The
grip
was
virgin
leather,
soft
and
black,
as
yet
unstained
by
sweat
or
blood.
The
blade
itself
was
a
good
half
foot
longer
than
those
Jon
was
used
to,
tapered
to
thrust
as
well
as
slash,
with
three
fullers
deeply
incised
in
the
metal.
Where
Ice
was
a
true
two-handed
greatsword,
this
was
a
hand-and-a-halfer,
sometimes
named
a
“bastard
sword.”
Yet
the
wolf
sword
actually
seemed
lighter
than
the
blades
he
had
wielded
before.
When
Jon
turned
it
sideways,
he
could
see
the
ripples
in
the
dark
steel
where
the
metal
had
been
folded
back
on
itself
again
and
again.
“This
is
Valyrian
steel,
my
lord,”
he
said
wonderingly.
His
father
had
let
him
handle
Ice
often
enough;
he
knew
the
look,
the
feel.

“It
is,”
the
Old
Bear
told
him.
“It
was
my
father’s
sword,
and
his
father’s
before
him.
The
Mormonts
have
carried
it
for
five
centuries.
I
wielded
it
in
my
day
and
passed
it
on
to
my
son
when
I
took
the
black.”

He
is
giving
me
his
son’s
sword.
Jon
could
scarcely
believe
it.
The
blade
was
exquisitely
balanced.
The
edges
glimmered
faintly
as
they
kissed
the
light.
“Your
son—”

“My
son
brought
dishonor
to
House
Mormont,
but
at
least
he
had
the
grace
to
leave
the
sword
behind
when
he
fled.
My
sister
returned
it
to
my
keeping,
but
the
very
sight
of
it
reminded
me
of
Jorah’s
shame,
so
I
put
it
aside
and
thought
no
more
of
it
until
we
found
it
in
the
ashes
of
my
bedchamber.
The
original
pommel
was
a
bear’s
head,
silver,
yet
so
worn
its
features
were
all
but
indistinguishable.
For
you,
I
thought
a
white
wolf
more
apt.
One
of
our
builders
is
a
fair
stonecarver.”

When
Jon
had
been
Bran’s
age,
he
had
dreamed
of
doing
great
deeds,
as
boys
always
did.
The
details
of
his
feats
changed
with
every
dreaming,
but
quite
often
he
imagined
saving
his
father’s
life.
Afterward
Lord
Eddard
would
declare
that
Jon
had
proved
himself
a
true
Stark,
and
place
Ice
in
his
hand.
Even
then
he
had
known
it
was
only
a
child’s
folly;
no
bastard
could
ever
hope
to
wield
a
father’s
sword.
Even
the
memory
shamed
him.
What
kind
of
man
stole
his
own
brother’s
birthright?
I
have
no
right
to
this,
he
thought,
no
more
than
to
Ice.
He
twitched
his
burned
fingers,
feeling
a
throb
of
pain
deep
under
the
skin.
“My
lord,
you
honor
me,
but—”

“Spare
me
your
but’s,
boy,”
Lord
Mormont
interrupted.
“I
would
not
be
sitting
here
were
it
not
for
you
and
that
beast
of
yours.
You
fought
bravely…
and
more
to
the
point,
you
thought
quickly.
Fire!
Yes,
damn
it.
We
ought
to
have
known.
We
ought
to
have
remembered.
The
Long
Night
has
come
before.
Oh,
eight
thousand
years
is
a
good
while,
to
be
sure…
yet
if
the
Night’s
Watch
does
not
remember,
who
will?”

“Who
will,”
chimed
the
talkative
raven.
“Who
will.”

Truly,
the
gods
had
heard
Jon’s
prayer
that
night;
the
fire
had
caught
in
the
dead
man’s
clothing
and
consumed
him
as
if
his
flesh
were
candle
wax
and
his
bones
old
dry
wood.
Jon
had
only
to
close
his
eyes
to
see
the
thing
staggering
across
the
solar,
crashing
against
the
furniture
and
flailing
at
the
flames.
It
was
the
face
that
haunted
him
most;
surrounded
by
a
nimbus
of
fire,
hair
blazing
like
straw,
the
dead
flesh
melting
away
and
sloughing
off
its
skull
to
reveal
the
gleam
of
bone
beneath.

Whatever
demonic
force
moved
Othor
had
been
driven
out
by
the
flames;
the
twisted
thing
they
had
found
in
the
ashes
had
been
no
more
than
cooked
meat
and
charred
bone.
Yet
in
his
nightmare
he
faced
it
again…
and
this
time
the
burning
corpse
wore
Lord
Eddard’s
features.
It
was
his
father’s
skin
that
burst
and
blackened,
his
father’s
eyes
that
ran
liquid
down
his
cheeks
like
jellied
tears.
Jon
did
not
understand
why
that
should
be
or
what
it
might
mean,
but
it
frightened
him
more
than
he
could
say.

“A
sword’s
small
payment
for
a
life,”
Mormont
concluded.
“Take
it,
I’ll
hear
no
more
of
it,
is
that
understood?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
The
soft
leather
gave
beneath
Jon’s
fingers,
as
if
the
sword
were
molding
itself
to
his
grip
already.
He
knew
he
should
be
honored,
and
he
was,
and
yet…

He
is
not
my
father.
The
thought
leapt
unbidden
to
Jon’s
mind.
Lord
Eddard
Stark
is
my
father.
I
will
not
forget
him,
no
matter
how
many
swords
they
give
me.
Yet
he
could
scarcely
tell
Lord
Mormont
that
it
was
another
man’s
sword
he
dreamt
of…

“I
want
no
courtesies
either,”
Mormont
said,
“so
thank
me
no
thanks.
Honor
the
steel
with
deeds,
not
words.”

Jon
nodded.
“Does
it
have
a
name,
my
lord?”

“It
did,
once.
Longclaw,
it
was
called.”

“Claw,”
the
raven
cried.
“Claw.”

“Longclaw
is
an
apt
name.”
Jon
tried
a
practice
cut.
He
was
clumsy
and
uncomfortable
with
his
left
hand,
yet
even
so
the
steel
seemed
to
flow
through
the
air,
as
if
it
had
a
will
of
its
own.
“Wolves
have
claws,
as
much
as
bears.”

The
Old
Bear
seemed
pleased
by
that.
“I
suppose
they
do.
You’ll
want
to
wear
that
over
the
shoulder,
I
imagine.
It’s
too
long
for
the
hip,
at
least
until
you’ve
put
on
a
few
inches.
And
you’ll
need
to
work
at
your
two-handed
strikes
as
well.
Ser
Endrew
can
show
you
some
moves,
when
your
burns
have
healed.”

“Ser
Endrew?”
Jon
did
not
know
the
name.

“Ser
Endrew
Tarth,
a
good
man.
He’s
on
his
way
from
the
Shadow
Tower
to
assume
the
duties
of
master-at-arms.
Ser
Alliser
Thorne
left
yestermorn
for
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.”

Jon
lowered
the
sword.
“Why?”
he
said,
stupidly.

Mormont
snorted.
“Because
I
sent
him,
why
do
you
think?
He’s
bringing
the
hand
your
Ghost
tore
off
the
end
of
Jafer
Flowers’s
wrist.
I
have
commanded
him
to
take
ship
to
King’s
Landing
and
lay
it
before
this
boy
king.
That
should
get
young
Joffrey’s
attention,
I’d
think…
and
Ser
Alliser’s
a
knight,
highborn,
anointed,
with
old
friends
at
court,
altogether
harder
to
ignore
than
a
glorified
crow.”

“Crow.”
Jon
thought
the
raven
sounded
faintly
indignant.

“As
well,”
the
Lord
Commander
continued,
ignoring
the
bird’s
protest,
“it
puts
a
thousand
leagues
twixt
him
and
you
without
it
seeming
a
rebuke.”
He
jabbed
a
finger
up
at
Jon’s
face.
“And
don’t
think
this
means
I
approve
of
that
nonsense
in
the
common
hall.
Valor
makes
up
for
a
fair
amount
of
folly,
but
you’re
not
a
boy
anymore,
however
many
years
you’ve
seen.
That’s
a
man’s
sword
you
have
there,
and
it
will
take
a
man
to
wield
her.
I’ll
expect
you
to
act
the
part,
henceforth.”

“Yes,
my
lord.”
Jon
slid
the
sword
back
into
the
silver-banded
scabbard.
If
not
the
blade
he
would
have
chosen,
it
was
nonetheless
a
noble
gift,
and
freeing
him
from
Alliser
Thorne’s
malignance
was
nobler
still.

The
Old
Bear
scratched
at
his
chin.
“I
had
forgotten
how
much
a
new
beard
itches,”
he
said.
“Well,
no
help
for
that.
Is
that
hand
of
yours
healed
enough
to
resume
your
duties?”

“Yes,
my
lord.”

“Good.
The
night
will
be
cold,
I’ll
want
hot
spice
wine.
Find
me
a
flagon
of
red,
not
too
sour,
and
don’t
skimp
on
the
spices.
And
tell
Hobb
that
if
he
sends
me
boiled
mutton
again
I’m
like
to
boil
him.
That
last
haunch
was
grey.
Even
the
bird
wouldn’t
touch
it.”
He
stroked
the
raven’s
head
with
his
thumb,
and
the
bird
made
a
contented
quorking
sound.
“Away
with
you.
I’ve
work
to
do.”

The
guards
smiled
at
him
from
their
niches
as
he
wound
his
way
down
the
turret
stair,
carrying
the
sword
in
his
good
hand.
“Sweet
steel,”
one
man
said.
“You
earned
that,
Snow,”
another
told
him.
Jon
made
himself
smile
back
at
them,
but
his
heart
was
not
in
it.
He
knew
he
should
be
pleased,
yet
he
did
not
feel
it.
His
hand
ached,
and
the
taste
of
anger
was
in
his
mouth,
though
he
could
not
have
said
who
he
was
angry
with
or
why.

A
half
dozen
of
his
friends
were
lurking
outside
when
he
left
the
King’s
Tower,
where
Lord
Commander
Mormont
now
made
his
residence.
They’d
hung
a
target
on
the
granary
doors,
so
they
could
seem
to
be
honing
their
skills
as
archers,
but
he
knew
lurkers
when
he
saw
them.
No
sooner
did
he
emerge
than
Pyp
called
out,
“Well,
come
about,
let’s
have
a
look.”

“At
what?”
Jon
said.

Toad
sidled
close.
“Your
rosy
butt
cheeks,
what
else?”

“The
sword,”
Grenn
stated.
“We
want
to
see
the
sword.”

Jon
raked
them
with
an
accusing
look.
“You
knew.”

Pyp
grinned.
“We’re
not
all
as
dumb
as
Grenn.”

“You
are
so,”
insisted
Grenn.
“You’re
dumber.”

Halder
gave
an
apologetic
shrug.
“I
helped
Pate
carve
the
stone
for
the
pommel,”
the
builder
said,
“and
your
friend
Sam
bought
the
garnets
in
Mole’s
Town.”

“We
knew
even
before
that,
though,”
Grenn
said.
“Rudge
has
been
helping
Donal
Noye
in
the
forge.
He
was
there
when
the
Old
Bear
brought
him
the
burnt
blade.”

“The
sword!”
Matt
insisted.
The
others
took
up
the
chant.
“The
sword,
the
sword,
the
sword.”

Jon
unsheathed
Longclaw
and
showed
it
to
them,
turning
it
this
way
and
that
so
they
could
admire
it.
The
bastard
blade
glittered
in
the
pale
sunlight,
dark
and
deadly.
“Valyrian
steel,”
he
declared
solemnly,
trying
to
sound
as
pleased
and
proud
as
he
ought
to
have
felt.

“I
heard
of
a
man
who
had
a
razor
made
of
Valyrian
steel,”
declared
Toad.
“He
cut
his
head
off
trying
to
shave.”

Pyp
grinned.
“The
Night’s
Watch
is
thousands
of
years
old,”
he
said,
“but
I’ll
wager
Lord
Snow’s
the
first
brother
ever
honored
for
burning
down
the
Lord
Commander’s
Tower.”

The
others
laughed,
and
even
Jon
had
to
smile.
The
fire
he’d
started
had
not,
in
truth,
burned
down
that
formidable
stone
tower,
but
it
had
done
a
fair
job
of
gutting
the
interior
of
the
top
two
floors,
where
the
Old
Bear
had
his
chambers.
No
one
seemed
to
mind
that
very
much,
since
it
had
also
destroyed
Othor’s
murderous
corpse.

The
other
wight,
the
one-handed
thing
that
had
once
been
a
ranger
named
Jafer
Flowers,
had
also
been
destroyed,
cut
near
to
pieces
by
a
dozen
swords…
but
not
before
it
had
slain
Ser
Jaremy
Rykker
and
four
other
men.
Ser
Jaremy
had
finished
the
job
of
hacking
its
head
off,
yet
had
died
all
the
same
when
the
headless
corpse
pulled
his
own
dagger
from
its
sheath
and
buried
it
in
his
bowels.
Strength
and
courage
did
not
avail
much
against
foemen
who
would
not
fall
because
they
were
already
dead;
even
arms
and
armor
offered
small
protection.

That
grim
thought
soured
Jon’s
fragile
mood.
“I
need
to
see
Hobb
about
the
Old
Bear’s
supper,”
he
announced
brusquely,
sliding
Longclaw
back
into
its
scabbard.
His
friends
meant
well,
but
they
did
not
understand.
It
was
not
their
fault,
truly;
they
had
not
had
to
face
Othor,
they
had
not
seen
the
pale
glow
of
those
dead
blue
eyes,
had
not
felt
the
cold
of
those
dead
black
fingers.
Nor
did
they
know
of
the
fighting
in
the
riverlands.
How
could
they
hope
to
comprehend?
He
turned
away
from
them
abruptly
and
strode
off,
sullen.
Pyp
called
after
him,
but
Jon
paid
him
no
mind.

They
had
moved
him
back
to
his
old
cell
in
tumbledown
Hardin’s
Tower
after
the
fire,
and
it
was
there
he
returned.
Ghost
was
curled
up
asleep
beside
the
door,
but
he
lifted
his
head
at
the
sound
of
Jon’s
boots.
The
direwolf’s
red
eyes
were
darker
than
garnets
and
wiser
than
men.
Jon
knelt,
scratched
his
ear,
and
showed
him
the
pommel
of
the
sword.
“Look.
It’s
you.”

Ghost
sniffed
at
his
carved
stone
likeness
and
tried
a
lick.
Jon
smiled.
“You’re
the
one
deserves
an
honor,”
he
told
the
wolf…
and
suddenly
he
found
himself
remembering
how
he’d
found
him,
that
day
in
the
late
summer
snow.
They
had
been
riding
off
with
the
other
pups,
but
Jon
had
heard
a
noise
and
turned
back,
and
there
he
was,
white
fur
almost
invisible
against
the
drifts.
He
was
all
alone,
he
thought,
apart
from
the
others
in
the
litter.
He
was
different,
so
they
drove
him
out.

“Jon?”
He
looked
up.
Samwell
Tarly
stood
rocking
nervously
on
his
heels.
His
cheeks
were
red,
and
he
was
wrapped
in
a
heavy
fur
cloak
that
made
him
look
ready
for
hibernation.

“Sam.”
Jon
stood.
“What
is
it?
Do
you
want
to
see
the
sword?”
If
the
others
had
known,
no
doubt
Sam
did
too.

The
fat
boy
shook
his
head.
“I
was
heir
to
my
father’s
blade
once,”
he
said
mournfully.
“Heartsbane.
Lord
Randyll
let
me
hold
it
a
few
times,
but
it
always
scared
me.
It
was
Valyrian
steel,
beautiful
but
so
sharp
I
was
afraid
I’d
hurt
one
of
my
sisters.
Dickon
will
have
it
now.”
He
wiped
sweaty
hands
on
his
cloak.
“I
ah…
Maester
Aemon
wants
to
see
you.”

It
was
not
time
for
his
bandages
to
be
changed.
Jon
frowned
suspiciously.
“Why?”
he
demanded.
Sam
looked
miserable.
That
was
answer
enough.
“You
told
him,
didn’t
you?”
Jon
said
angrily.
“You
told
him
that
you
told
me.”

“I…
he…
Jon,
I
didn’t
want
to…
he
asked…
I
mean
I
think
he
knew,
he
sees
things
no
one
else
sees…”

“He’s
blind,”
Jon
pointed
out
forcefully,
disgusted.
“I
can
find
the
way
myself.”
He
left
Sam
standing
there,
openmouthed
and
quivering.

He
found
Maester
Aemon
up
in
the
rookery,
feeding
the
ravens.
Clydas
was
with
him,
carrying
a
bucket
of
chopped
meat
as
they
shuffled
from
cage
to
cage.
“Sam
said
you
wanted
me?”

The
maester
nodded.
“I
did
indeed.
Clydas,
give
Jon
the
bucket.
Perhaps
he
will
be
kind
enough
to
assist
me.”
The
hunched,
pink-eyed
brother
handed
Jon
the
bucket
and
scurried
down
the
ladder.
“Toss
the
meat
into
the
cages,”
Aemon
instructed
him.
“The
birds
will
do
the
rest.
“

Jon
shifted
the
bucket
to
his
right
hand
and
thrust
his
left
down
into
the
bloody
bits.
The
ravens
began
to
scream
noisily
and
fly
at
the
bars,
beating
at
the
metal
with
night-black
wings.
The
meat
had
been
chopped
into
pieces
no
larger
than
a
finger
joint.
He
filled
his
fist
and
tossed
the
raw
red
morsels
into
the
cage,
and
the
squawking
and
squabbling
grew
hotter.
Feathers
flew
as
two
of
the
larger
birds
fought
over
a
choice
piece.
Quickly
Jon
grabbed
a
second
handful
and
threw
it
in
after
the
first.
“Lord
Mormont’s
raven
likes
fruit
and
corn.”

“He
is
a
rare
bird,”
the
maester
said.
“Most
ravens
will
eat
grain,
but
they
prefer
flesh.
It
makes
them
strong,
and
I
fear
they
relish
the
taste
of
blood.
In
that
they
are
like
men…
and
like
men,
not
all
ravens
are
alike.”

Jon
had
nothing
to
say
to
that.
He
threw
meat,
wondering
why
he’d
been
summoned.
No
doubt
the
old
man
would
tell
him,
in
his
own
good
time.
Maester
Aemon
was
not
a
man
to
be
hurried.

“Doves
and
pigeons
can
also
be
trained
to
carry
messages,”
the
maester
went
on,
“though
the
raven
is
a
stronger
flyer,
larger,
bolder,
far
more
clever,
better
able
to
defend
itself
against
hawks…
yet
ravens
are
black,
and
they
eat
the
dead,
so
some
godly
men
abhor
them.
Baelor
the
Blessed
tried
to
replace
all
the
ravens
with
doves,
did
you
know?”
The
maester
turned
his
white
eyes
on
Jon,
smiling.
“The
Night’s
Watch
prefers
ravens.”

Jon’s
fingers
were
in
the
bucket,
blood
up
to
the
wrist.
“Dywen
says
the
wildlings
call
us
crows,”
he
said
uncertainty.

“The
crow
is
the
raven’s
poor
cousin.
They
are
both
beggars
in
black,
hated
and
misunderstood.”

Jon
wished
he
understood
what
they
were
talking
about,
and
why.
What
did
he
care
about
ravens
and
doves?
If
the
old
man
had
something
to
say
to
him,
why
couldn’t
he
just
say
it?

“Jon,
did
you
ever
wonder
why
the
men
of
the
Night’s
Watch
take
no
wives
and
father
no
children?”
Maester
Aemon
asked.

Jon
shrugged.
“No.”
He
scattered
more
meat.
The
fingers
of
his
left
hand
were
slimy
with
blood,
and
his
right
throbbed
from
the
weight
of
the
bucket.

“So
they
will
not
love,”
the
old
man
answered,
“for
love
is
the
bane
of
honor,
the
death
of
duty.”

That
did
not
sound
right
to
Jon,
yet
he
said
nothing.
The
maester
was
a
hundred
years
old,
and
a
high
officer
of
the
Night’s
Watch;
it
was
not
his
place
to
contradict
him.

The
old
man
seemed
to
sense
his
doubts.
“Tell
me,
Jon,
if
the
day
should
ever
come
when
your
lord
father
must
needs
choose
between
honor
on
the
one
hand
and
those
he
loves
on
the
other,
what
would
he
do?”

Jon
hesitated.
He
wanted
to
say
that
Lord
Eddard
would
never
dishonor
himself,
not
even
for
love,
yet
inside
a
small
sly
voice
whispered,
He
fathered
a
bastard,
where
was
the
honor
in
that?
And
your
mother,
what
of
his
duty
to
her,
he
will
not
even
say
her
name.
“He
would
do
whatever
was
right,”
he
said…
ringingly,
to
make
up
for
his
hesitation.
“No
matter
what.”

“Then
Lord
Eddard
is
a
man
in
ten
thousand.
Most
of
us
are
not
so
strong.
What
is
honor
compared
to
a
woman’s
love?
What
is
duty
against
the
feel
of
a
newborn
son
in
your
arms…
or
the
memory
of
a
brother’s
smile?
Wind
and
words.
Wind
and
words.
We
are
only
human,
and
the
gods
have
fashioned
us
for
love.
That
is
our
great
glory,
and
our
great
tragedy.

“The
men
who
formed
the
Night’s
Watch
knew
that
only
their
courage
shielded
the
realm
from
the
darkness
to
the
north.
They
knew
they
must
have
no
divided
loyalties
to
weaken
their
resolve.
So
they
vowed
they
would
have
no
wives
nor
children.

“Yet
brothers
they
had,
and
sisters.
Mothers
who
gave
them
birth,
fathers
who
gave
them
names.
They
came
from
a
hundred
quarrelsome
kingdoms,
and
they
knew
times
may
change,
but
men
do
not.
So
they
pledged
as
well
that
the
Night’s
Watch
would
take
no
part
in
the
battles
of
the
realms
it
guarded.

“They
kept
their
pledge.
When
Aegon
slew
Black
Harren
and
claimed
his
kingdom,
Harren’s
brother
was
Lord
Commander
on
the
Wall,
with
ten
thousand
swords
to
hand.
He
did
not
march.
In
the
days
when
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
seven
kingdoms,
not
a
generation
passed
that
three
or
four
of
them
were
not
at
war.
The
Watch
took
no
part.
When
the
Andals
crossed
the
narrow
sea
and
swept
away
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men,
the
sons
of
the
fallen
kings
held
true
to
their
vows
and
remained
at
their
posts.
So
it
has
always
been,
for
years
beyond
counting.
Such
is
the
price
of
honor.

“A
craven
can
be
as
brave
as
any
man,
when
there
is
nothing
to
fear.
And
we
all
do
our
duty,
when
there
is
no
cost
to
it.
How
easy
it
seems
then,
to
walk
the
path
of
honor.
Yet
soon
or
late
in
every
man’s
life
comes
a
day
when
it
is
not
easy,
a
day
when
he
must
choose.”

Some
of
the
ravens
were
still
eating,
long
stringy
bits
of
meat
dangling
from
their
beaks.
The
rest
seemed
to
be
watching
him.
Jon
could
feel
the
weight
of
all
those
tiny
black
eyes.
“And
this
is
my
day…
is
that
what
you’re
saying?”

Maester
Aemon
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
him
with
those
dead
white
eyes.
It
was
as
if
he
were
seeing
right
into
his
heart.
Jon
felt
naked
and
exposed.
He
took
the
bucket
in
both
hands
and
flung

rest
of
the
<<<<<<< 1441d55ef0d8b5e242e34427404d9d5041159095
Sand
Snakes.
That
would
have
made
Lord
Harmen
wroth,
and
the
Ullers
were
dangerous
when
wroth.
Too
dangerous,
perhaps.
The
princess
did
not
want
to
put
any
more
lives
in
danger.

Lord
Fowler
might
be
a
safer
choice.
The
Old
Hawk,
he
was
called.
He
had
never
gotten
on
with
Anders
Yronwood;
there
was
bad
blood
between
their
Houses
going
back
a
thousand
years,
from
when
the
Fowlers
had
chosen
Martell
over
Yronwood
during
Nymeria’s
War.
The
Fowler
twins
were
famous
friends
of
Lady
Nym
as
well,
but
how
much
weight
would
that
carry
with
the
Old
Hawk?

For
days
Arianne
wavered
as
she
composed
her
secret
letter.
“Give
the
man
who
brings
this
to
you
a
hundred
silver
stags,”
she
began.
That
should
ensure
that
the
message
was
delivered.
She
wrote
where
she
was,
and
pleaded
for
rescue.
“Whoever
shall
deliver
me
from
this
cell,
he
shall
not
be
forgotten
when
I
wed.”
That
should
bring
the
heroes
running.
Unless
Prince
Doran
had
attainted
her,
she
remained
the
lawful
heir
to
Sunspear;
the
man
who
married
her
would
one
day
rule
Dorne
by
her
side.
Arianne
could
only
pray
that
her
rescuer
would
prove
younger
than
the
greybeards
her
father
had
offered
her
over
the
years.
“I
want
a
consort
with
teeth,”
she
had
told
him
when
she
refused
the
last.

She
dare
not
ask
for
parchment
for
fear
of
rousing
the
suspicions
of
her
captors,
so
she
wrote
the
letter
on
the
bottom
of
a
page
torn
from
The
Seven-Pointed
Star,
and
pressed
it
into
Cedra’s
hand
on
her
next
bath
day.
“There’s
a
place
beside
the
Threefold
Gate
where
the
caravans
take
on
supplies
before
crossing
the
deep
sand,”
Arianne
told
her.
“Find
some
traveler
headed
for
the
Prince’s
Pass,
and
promise
him
a
hundred
silver
stags
if
he
will
put
this
in
Lord
Fowler’s
hand.”

“I
will.”
Cedra
hid
the
message
in
her
bodice.
“I’ll
find
someone
before
the
sun
goes
down,
princess.”

“Good,”
she
said.
“Tell
me
how
it
went
on
the
morrow.”

The
girl
did
not
return
upon
the
morrow,
however.
Nor
on
the
day
that
followed.
When
it
was
time
for
Arianne
to
bathe,
it
was
Morra
and
Mellei
who
filled
her
tub,
and
stayed
to
wash
her
back
and
brush
her
hair.
“Has
Cedra
taken
ill?”
the
princess
asked
them,
but
neither
would
reply.
She
has
been
caught
was
all
that
she
could
think.
What
else
could
it
be?
That
night
she
hardly
slept,
for
fear
of
what
might
come
next.

When
Timoth
brought
her
breakfast
the
next
morning,
Arianne
asked
to
see
Ricasso
rather
than
her
father.
Plainly
she
could
not
compel
Prince
Doran
to
attend
her,
but
surely
a
mere
seneschal
would
not
ignore
a
summons
from
the
rightful
heir
to
Sunspear.

He
did,
though.
“Did
you
tell
Ricasso
what
I
said?”
she
demanded
the
next
time
she
saw
Timoth.
“Did
you
tell
him
I
had
need
of
him?”
When
the
man
refused
to
answer
her,
Arianne
seized
a
flagon
of
red
wine
and
upended
it
over
his
head.
The
serving
man
retreated
dripping,
his
face
a
mask
of
wounded
dignity.
My
father
means
to
leave
me
here
to
rot,
the
princess
decided.
Or
else
he
is
making
plans
to
marry
me
off
to
some
disgusting
old
fool
and
intends
to
keep
me
locked
away
until
the
bedding.

Arianne
Martell
had
grown
up
expecting
that
one
day
she
would
wed
some
great
lord
of
her
father’s
choosing.
That
was
what
princesses
were
for,
she
had
been
taught...
though,
admittedly,
her
uncle
Oberyn
had
taken
a
different
view
of
matters.
“If
you
would
wed,
wed,”
the
Red
Viper
had
told
his
own
daughters.
“If
not,
take
your
pleasure
where
you
find
it.
There’s
little
enough
of
it
in
this
world.
Choose
well,
though.
If
you
saddle
yourself
with
a
fool
or
a
brute,
don’t
look
to
me
to
rid
you
of
him.
I
gave
you
the
tools
to
do
that
for
yourself.”

The
freedom
that
Prince
Oberyn
allowed
his
bastard
daughters
had
never
been
shared
by
Prince
Doran’s
lawful
heir.
Arianne
must
wed;
she
had
accepted
that.
Drey
had
wanted
her,
she
knew;
so
had
his
brother
Deziel,
the
Knight
of
Lemonwood.
Daemon
Sand
had
gone
so
far
as
to
ask
for
her
hand.
Daemon
was
bastard-born,
however,
and
Prince
Doran
did
not
mean
for
her
to
wed
a
Dornishman.

Arianne
had
accepted
that
as
well.
One
year
King
Robert’s
brother
came
to
visit
and
she
did
her
best
to
seduce
him,
but
she
was
half
a
girl
and
Lord
Renly
seemed
more
bemused
than
inflamed
by
her
overtures.
Later,
when
Hoster
Tully
asked
her
to
come
to
Riverrun
and
meet
his
heir,
she
lit
candles
to
the
Maid
in
thanks,
but
Prince
Doran
had
declined
the
invitation.
The
princess
might
even
have
considered
Willas
Tyrell,
crippled
leg
and
all,
but
her
father
refused
to
send
her
to
Highgarden
to
meet
him.
She
tried
to
go
despite
him,
with
Tyene’s
help...
but
Prince
Oberyn
caught
them
at
Vaith
and
brought
them
back.
That
same
year,
Prince
Doran
tried
to
betroth
her
to
Ben
Beesbury,
a
minor
lordling
who
was
eighty
if
he
was
a
day,
and
as
blind
as
he
was
toothless.

Beesbury
died
a
few
years
later.
That
gave
her
some
small
comfort
in
her
present
pass;
she
could
not
be
forced
to
marry
him
if
he
was
dead.
And
the
Lord
of
the
Crossing
had
wed
again,
so
she
was
safe
from
him
as
well.
Elden
Estermont
is
still
alive
and
unwed,
though.
Lord
Rosby
and
Lord
Grandison
as
well.
Grandison
was
called
the
Greybeard,
but
by
the
time
she’d
met
him
his
beard
had
gone
snow
white.
At
the
welcoming
feast,
he
had
gone
to
sleep
between
the
fish
course
and
the
meat.
Drey
called
that
apt,
since
his
sigil
was
a
sleeping
lion.
Garin
challenged
her
to
see
if
she
could
tie
a
knot
in
his
beard
without
waking
him,
but
Arianne
refrained.
Grandison
had
seemed
a
pleasant
fellow,
less
querulous
than
Estermont
and
more
robust
than
Rosby.
She
would
never
marry
him,
however.
Not
even
if
Hotah
stands
behind
me
with
his
axe.

No
one
came
to
marry
her
the
next
day,
nor
the
day
after.
Nor
did
Cedra
return.
Arianne
tried
to
win
Morra
and
Mellei
the
same
way,
but
it
was
no
good.
If
she
had
been
able
to
get
either
one
alone
she
might
have
some
hope,
but
together
the
sisters
were
a
wall.
By
that
time,
the
princess
would
have
welcomed
a
touch
of
a
hot
iron,
or
an
evening
on
the
rack.
The
loneliness
was
like
to
drive
her
mad.
I
deserve
a
headsman’s
axe
for
what
I
did,
but
he
will
not
even
give
me
that.
He
would
sooner
shut
me
away
and
forget
I
ever
lived.
She
wondered
if
Maester
Caleotte
was
drawing
a
proclamation
to
name
her
brother
Quentyn
heir
to
Dorne.

Days
came
and
went,
one
after
the
other,
so
many
that
Arianne
lost
count
of
how
long
she
had
been
imprisoned.
She
found
herself
spending
more
and
more
time
abed,
until
she
reached
the
point
where
she
did
not
rise
at
all
except
to
use
her
privy.
The
meals
the
servants
brought
grew
cold,
untouched.
Arianne
slept
and
woke
and
slept
again,
and
still
felt
too
weary
to
rise.
She
prayed
to
the
Mother
for
mercy
and
to
the
Warrior
for
courage,
then
slept
some
more.
Fresh
meals
replaced
the
old
ones,
but
she
did
not
eat
them
either.
Once,
when
she
felt
especially
strong,
she
carried
all
the
food
to
the
window
and
flung
it
out
into
the
yard,
so
it
would
not
tempt
her.
The
effort
exhausted
her,
so
afterward
she
crawled
back
into
bed
and
slept
for
half
a
day.

Then
came
a
day
when
a
rough
hand
woke
her,
shaking
her
by
the
shoulder.
“Little
princess,”
said
a
voice
she’d
known
from
childhood.
“Up
and
dress.
The
prince
has
called
for
you.”
Areo
Hotah
stood
over
her,
her
old
friend
and
protector.
He
was
talking
to
her.
Arianne
smiled
sleepily.
It
was
good
to
see
that
seamed,
scarred
face,
and
hear
his
gruff,
deep
voice
and
thick
Norvoshi
accent.
“What
did
you
do
with
Cedra?”

“The
prince
sent
her
to
the
Water
Gardens,”
Hotah
said.
“He
will
tell
you.
First
you
must
wash,
and
eat.”

She
must
look
a
wretched
creature.
Arianne
crawled
from
the
bed,
weak
as
a
kitten.
“Have
Morra
and
Mellei
prepare
a
bath,”
she
told
him,
“and
tell
Timoth
to
bring
me
up
some
food.
Nothing
heavy.
Some
cold
broth
and
a
bit
of
bread
and
fruit.”

“Aye,”
said
Hotah.
Never
had
she
heard
a
sweeter
sound.

The
captain
waited
without
whilst
the
princess
bathed
and
brushed
her
hair
and
ate
sparingly
of
the
cheese
and
fruit
they’d
brought
her.
She
drank
a
little
wine
to
settle
her
stomach.
I
am
frightened,
she
realized,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life,
I
am
frightened
of
my
father.
That
made
her
laugh
until
the
wine
came
out
her
nose.
When
it
was
time
to
dress,
she
chose
a
simple
gown
of
ivory
linen,
with
vines
and
purple
grapes
embroidered
around
the
sleeves
and
bodice.
She
wore
no
jewels.
I
must
be
chaste
and
humble
and
contrite.
I
must
throw
myself
at
his
feet
and
beg
forgiveness,
or
I
may
never
hear
another
human
voice
again.

By
the
time
she
was
ready,
dusk
had
fallen.
Arianne
had
thought
that
Hotah
would
escort
her
to
the
Tower
of
the
Sun
to
hear
her
father’s
judgment.
Instead
he
delivered
her
to
the
prince’s
solar,
where
they
found
Doran
Martell
seated
behind
a
cyvasse
table,
his
gouty
legs
supported
by
a
cushioned
footstool.
He
was
toying
with
an
onyx
elephant,
turning
it
in
his
reddened,
swollen
hands.
The
prince
looked
worse
than
she
had
ever
seen
him.
His
face
was
pale
and
puffy,
his
joints
so
inflamed
that
it
hurt
her
just
to
look
at
them.
Seeing
him
this
way
made
Arianne’s
heart
go
out
to
him...
yet
somehow
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
kneel
and
beg,
as
she
had
planned.
“Father,”
she
said
instead.

When
he
raised
his
head
to
look
at
her,
his
dark
eyes
were
clouded
with
pain.
Is
that
the
gout?
Arianne
wondered.
Or
is
it
me?
“A
strange
and
subtle
folk,
the
Volantenes,”
he
muttered,
as
he
put
the
elephant
aside.
“I
saw
Volantis
once,
on
my
way
to
Norvos,
where
I
first
met
Mellario.
The
bells
were
ringing,
and
the
bears
danced
down
the
steps.
Areo
will
recall
the
day.”

“I
remember,”
echoed
Areo
Hotah
in
his
deep
voice.
“The
bears
danced
and
the
bells
rang,
and
the
prince
wore
red
and
gold
and
orange.
My
lady
asked
me
who
it
was
who
shone
so
bright.”

Prince
Doran
smiled
wanly.
“Leave
us,
captain.”

Hotah
stamped
the
butt
of
his
longaxe
on
the
floor,
turned
on
his
heel,
and
took
his
leave.

“I
told
them
to
place
a
cyvasse
table
in
your
chambers,”
her
father
said
when
the
two
of
them
were
alone.

“Who
was
I
supposed
to
play
with?”
Why
is
he
talking
about
a
game?
Has
the
gout
robbed
him
of
his
wits?

“Yourself.
Sometimes
it
is
best
to
study
a
game
before
you
attempt
to
play
it.
How
well
do
you
know
the
game,
Arianne?”

“Well
enough
to
play.”

“But
not
to
win.
My
brother
loved
the
fight
for
its
own
sake,
but
I
only
play
such
games
as
I
can
win.
Cyvasse
is
not
for
me.”
He
studied
her
face
for
a
long
moment
before
he
said,
“Why?
Tell
me
that,
Arianne.
Tell
me
why.”

“For
the
honor
of
our
House.”
Her
father’s
voice
made
her
angry.
He
sounded
so
sad,
so
exhausted,
so
weak.
You
are
a
prince!
she
wanted
to
shout.
You
should
be
raging!
“Your
meekness
shames
all
Dorne,
Father.
Your
brother
went
to
King’s
Landing
in
your
place,
and
they
killed
him!”

“Do
you
think
I
do
not
know
that?
Oberyn
is
with
me
every
time
I
close
my
eyes.”

“Telling
you
to
open
them,
no
doubt.”
She
seated
herself
across
the
cyvasse
table
from
her
father.

“I
did
not
give
you
leave
to
sit.”

“Then
call
Hotah
back
and
whip
me
for
my
insolence.
You
are
the
Prince
of
Dorne.
You
can
do
that.”
She
touched
one
of
the
cyvasse
pieces,
the
heavy
horse.
“Have
you
caught
Ser
Gerold?”

He
shook
his
head.
“Would
that
we
had.
You
were
a
fool
to
make
him
part
of
this.
Darkstar
is
the
most
dangerous
man
in
Dorne.
You
and
he
have
done
us
all
great
harm.”

Arianne
was
almost
afraid
to
ask.
“Myrcella.
Is
she...?”

“...dead?
No,
though
Darkstar
did
his
best.
All
eyes
were
on
your
white
knight
so
no
one
seems
quite
certain
just
what
happened,
but
it
would
appear
that
her
horse
shied
away
from
his
at
the
last
instant,
else
he
would
have
taken
off
the
top
of
the
girl’s
skull.
As
it
is,
the
slash
opened
her
cheek
down
to
the
bone
and
sliced
off
her
right
ear.
Maester
Caleotte
was
able
to
save
her
life,
but
no
poultice
nor
potion
will
ever
restore
her
face.
She
was
my
ward,
Arianne.
Betrothed
to
your
own
brother
and
under
my
protection.
You
have
dishonored
all
of
us.”

“I
never
meant
her
harm,”
Arianne
insisted.
“If
Hotah
had
not
interfered...”

“...you
would
have
crowned
Myrcella
queen,
to
raise
a
rebellion
against
her
brother.
Instead
of
an
ear,
she
would
have
lost
her
life.”

“Only
if
we
lost.”

“If?
The
word
is
when.
Dorne
is
the
least
populous
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms.
It
pleased
the
Young
Dragon
to
make
all
our
armies
larger
when
he
wrote
that
book
of
his,
so
as
to
make
his
conquest
that
much
more
glorious,
and
it
has
pleased
us
to
water
the
seed
he
planted
and
let
our
foes
think
us
more
powerful
than
we
are,
but
a
princess
ought
to
know
the
truth.
Valor
is
a
poor
substitute
for
numbers.
Dorne
cannot
hope
to
win
a
war
against
the
Iron
Throne,
not
alone.
And
yet
that
may
well
be
what
you
have
given
us.
Are
you
proud?”
The
prince
did
not
allow
her
time
to
answer.
“What
am
I
to
do
with
you,
Arianne?”

Forgive
me,
part
of
her
wanted
to
say,
but
his
words
had
cut
her
too
deeply.
“Why,
do
what
you
always
do.
Do
nothing.”

“You
make
it
difficult
for
a
man
to
swallow
his
anger.”

“Best
stop
swallowing,
you’re
like
to
choke
on
it.”
The
prince
did
not
answer.
“Tell
me
how
you
knew
my
plans.”

“I
am
the
Prince
of
Dorne.
Men
seek
my
favor.”

Someone
told.
“You
knew,
and
yet
you
still
allowed
us
to
make
off
with
Myrcella.
Why?”

“That
was
my
mistake,
and
it
has
proved
a
grievous
one.
You
are
my
daughter,
Arianne.
The
little
girl
who
used
to
run
to
me
when
she
skinned
her
knee.
I
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
you
would
conspire
against
me.
I
had
to
learn
the
truth.”

“Now
you
have.
I
want
to
know
who
informed
on
me.”

“I
would
as
well,
in
your
place.”

“Will
you
tell
me?”

“I
can
think
of
no
reason
why
I
should.”

“You
think
I
cannot
discover
the
truth
on
my
own?”

“You
are
welcome
to
try.
Until
such
time
you
must
mistrust
them
all...
and
a
little
mistrust
is
a
good
thing
in
a
princess.”
Prince
Doran
sighed.
“You
disappoint
me,
Arianne.”

“Said
the
crow
to
the
raven.
You
have
been
disappointing
me
for
years,
Father.”
She
had
not
meant
to
be
so
blunt
with
him,
but
the
words
came
spilling
out.
There,
now
I
have
said
it.

“I
know.
I
am
too
meek
and
weak
and
cautious,
too
lenient
to
our
enemies.
Just
now,
though,
you
are
in
need
of
some
of
that
leniency,
it
seems
to
me.
You
ought
to
be
pleading
for
my
forgiveness
rather
than
seeking
to
provoke
me
further.”

“I
ask
leniency
only
for
my
friends.”

“How
noble
of
you.”

“What
they
did
they
did
for
love
for
me.
They
do
not
deserve
to
die
on
Ghaston
Grey.”

“As
it
happens,
I
agree.
Aside
from
Darkstar,
your
fellow
plotters
were
no
more
than
foolish
children.
Still,
this
was
no
harmless
game
of
cyvasse.
You
and
your
friends
were
playing
at
treason.
I
might
have
had
their
heads
off.”

“You
might
have,
but
you
didn’t.
Dayne,
Dalt,
Santagar...
no,
you
would
never
dare
make
enemies
of
such
Houses.”

“I
dare
more
than
you
dream...
but
leave
that
for
the
nonce.
Ser
Andrey
has
been
sent
to
Norvos
to
serve
your
lady
mother
for
three
years.
Garin
will
spend
his
next
two
years
in
Tyrosh.
From
his
kin
amongst
the
orphans,
I
took
coin
and
hostages.
Lady
Sylva
received
no
punishment
from
me,
but
she
was
of
an
age
to
marry.
Her
father
has
shipped
her
to
Greenstone
to
wed
Lord
Estermont.
As
for
Arys
Oakheart,
he
chose
his
own
fate
and
met
it
bravely.
A
knight
of
the
Kingsguard...
what
did
you
do
to
him?”

“I
fucked
him,
Father.
You
did
command
me
to
entertain
our
noble
visitors,
as
I
recall.”

His
face
grew
flushed.
“Was
that
all
that
was
required?”

“I
told
him
that
once
Myrcella
was
the
queen
she
would
give
us
leave
to
marry.
He
wanted
me
for
his
wife.”

“You
did
everything
you
could
to
stop
him
from
dishonoring
his
vows,
I
am
certain,”
her
father
said.

It
was
her
turn
to
flush.
Her
seduction
of
Ser
Arys
had
required
half
a
year.
Though
he
claimed
to
have
known
other
women
before
taking
the
white,
she
would
never
have
known
that
from
the
way
he
acted.
His
caresses
had
been
clumsy,
his
kisses
nervous,
and
the
first
time
they
were
abed
together
he
spent
his
seed
on
her
thigh
as
she
was
guiding
him
inside
her
with
her
hand.
Worse,
he
had
been
consumed
by
shame.
If
she
only
had
a
dragon
for
every
time
he
had
whispered,
“We
should
not
be
doing
this,”
she
would
be
richer
than
the
Lannisters.
Did
he
charge
at
Areo
Hotah
in
hopes
of
saving
me?
Arianne
wondered.
Or
did
he
do
it
to
escape
me,
to
wash
out
his
dishonor
with
his
life’s
blood?
“He
did
love
me,”
she
heard
herself
say.
“He
died
for
me.”

“If
so,
he
may
well
be
but
the
first
of
many.
You
and
your
cousins
wanted
war.
You
may
get
your
wish.
Another
Kingsguard
knight
creeps
toward
Sunspear
even
as
we
speak.
Ser
Balon
Swann
is
bringing
me
the
Mountain’s
head.
My
bannermen
have
been
delaying
him,
to
purchase
me
some
time.
The
Wyls
kept
him
hunting
and
hawking
for
eight
days
on
the
Boneway,
and
Lord
Yronwood
feasted
him
for
a
fortnight
when
he
emerged
from
the
mountains.
At
present
he
is
at
the
Tor,
where
Lady
Jordayne
has
arranged
games
in
his
honor.
When
he
reaches
Ghost
Hill
he
will
find
Lady
Toland
intent
on
outdoing
her.
Soon
or
late,
however,
Ser
Balon
must
arrive
at
Sunspear,
and
when
he
does
he
will
expect
to
see
Princess
Myrcella...
and
Ser
Arys,
his
Sworn
Brother.
What
shall
we
tell
him,
Arianne?
Shall
I
say
that
Oakheart
perished
in
a
hunting
accident,
or
from
a
tumble
down
some
slippery
steps?
Perhaps
Arys
went
swimming
at
the
Water
Gardens,
slipped
upon
the
marble,
hit
his
head,
and
drowned?”

“No,”
Arianne
said.
“Say
that
he
died
defending
his
little
princess.
Tell
Ser
Balon
that
Darkstar
tried
to
kill
her
and
Ser
Arys
stepped
between
them
and
saved
her
life.”
That
was
how
the
white
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
were
supposed
to
die,
giving
up
their
own
lives
for
those
that
they
had
sworn
to
protect.
“Ser
Balon
may
be
suspicious,
as
you
were
when
the
Lannisters
killed
your
sister
and
her
children,
but
he
will
have
no
proof...”

“...until
he
speaks
with
Myrcella.
Or
must
that
brave
child
suffer
a
tragic
accident
as
well?
If
so,
it
will
mean
war.
No
lie
will
save
Dorne
from
the
queen’s
wroth
if
her
daughter
should
perish
whilst
in
my
care.”

He
needs
me,
Arianne
realized.
That’s
why
he
sent
for
me.

“I
could
tell
Myrcella
what
to
say,
but
why
should
I?”

A
spasm
of
anger
rippled
across
her
father’s
face.
“I
warn
you,
Arianne,
I
am
out
of
patience.”

“With
me?”
That
is
so
like
him.
“For
Lord
Tywin
and
the
Lannisters
you
always
had
the
forbearance
of
Baelor
the
Blessed,
but
for
your
own
blood,
none.”

“You
mistake
patience
for
forbearance.
I
have
worked
at
the
downfall
of
Tywin
Lannister
since
the
day
they
told
me
of
Elia
and
her
children.
It
was
my
hope
to
strip
him
of
all
that
he
held
most
dear
before
I
killed
him,
but
it
would
seem
his
dwarf
son
has
robbed
me
of
that
pleasure.
I
take
some
small
solace
in
knowing
that
he
died
a
cruel
death
at
the
hands
of
the
monster
that
he
himself
begot.
Be
that
as
it
may.
Lord
Tywin
is
howling
down
in
hell...
where
thousands
more
will
soon
be
joining
him,
if
your
folly
turns
to
war.”
Her
father
grimaced,
as
if
the
very
word
were
painful
to
him.
“Is
that
what
you
want?”

The
princess
refused
to
be
cowed.
“I
want
my
cousins
freed.
I
want
my
uncle
avenged.
I
want
my
rights.”

“Your
rights?”

“Dorne.”

“You
will
have
Dorne
after
I
am
dead.
Are
you
so
anxious
to
be
rid
of
me?”

“I
should
turn
that
question
back
on
you,
Father.
You
have
been
trying
to
rid
yourself
of
me
for
years.”

“That
is
not
true.”

“No?
Shall
we
ask
my
brother?”

“Trystane?”

“Quentyn.”

“What
of
him?”

“Where
is
he?”

“He
is
with
Lord
Yronwood’s
host
in
the
Boneway.”

“You
do
lie
well,
Father,
I
will
grant
you
that.
You
did
not
so
much
as
blink.
Quentyn
has
gone
to
Lys.”

“Where
did
you
get
that
notion?”

“A
friend
told
me.”
She
could
have
secrets
too.

“Your
friend
lied.
You
have
my
word,
your
brother
has
not
gone
to
Lys.
I
swear
it
by
sun
and
spear
and
Seven.”

Arianne
could
not
be
fooled
so
easily.
“Is
it
Myr,
then?
Tyrosh?
I
know
he
is
somewhere
across
the
narrow
sea,
hiring
sellswords
to
steal
away
my
birthright.”

Her
father’s
face
darkened.
“This
mistrust
does
you
no
honor,
Arianne.
Quentyn
should
be
the
one
conspiring
against
me.
I
sent
him
away
when
he
was
just
a
child,
too
young
to
understand
the
needs
of
Dorne.
Anders
Yronwood
has
been
more
a
father
to
him
than
I
have,
yet
your
brother
remains
faithful
and
obedient.”

“Why
not?
You
favor
him
and
always
have.
He
looks
like
you,
he
thinks
like
you,
and
you
mean
to
give
him
Dorne,
don’t
trouble
to
deny
it.
I
read
your
letter.”
The
words
still
burned
as
bright
as
fire
in
her
memory.
“‘One
day
you
will
sit
where
I
sit
and
rule
all
Dorne,’
you
wrote
him.
Tell
me,
Father,
when
did
you
decide
to
disinherit
me?
Was
it
the
day
that
Quentyn
was
born,
or
the
day
that
I
was
born?
What
did
I
ever
do
to
make
you
hate
me
so?”
To
her
fury,
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes.

“I
never
hated
you.”
Prince
Doran’s
voice
was
parchment-thin,
and
full
of
grief.
“Arianne,
you
do
not
understand.”

“Do
you
deny
you
wrote
those
words?”

“No.
That
was
when
Quentyn
first
went
to
Yronwood.
I
did
intend
for
him
to
follow
me,
yes.
I
had
other
plans
for
you.”

“Oh,
yes,”
she
said
scornfully,
“such
plans.
Gyles
Rosby.
Blind
Ben
Beesbury.
Greybeard
Grandison.
They
were
your
plans.”

She
gave
him
no
chance
to
reply.
“I
know
it
is
my
duty
to
provide
an
heir
for
Dorne,
I
have
never
been
forgetful
of
that.
I
would
have
wed,
and
gladly,
but
the
matches
that
you
brought
to
me
were
insults.
With
every
one
you
spit
on
me.
If
you
ever
felt
any
love
for
me
at
all,
why
offer
me
to
Walder
Frey?”

“Because
I
knew
that
you
would
spurn
him.
I
had
to
be
seen
to
try
to
find
a
consort
for
you
once
you’d
reached
a
certain
age,
else
it
would
have
raised
suspicions,
but
I
dared
not
bring
you
any
man
you
might
accept.
You
were
promised,
Arianne.”

Promised?
Arianne
stared
at
him
incredulously.
“What
are
you
saying?
Is
this
another
lie?
You
never
said...”

“The
pact
was
sealed
in
secret.
I
meant
to
tell
you
when
you
were
old
enough...
when
you
came
of
age,
I
thought,
but...”

“I
am
three-and-twenty,
for
seven
years
a
woman
grown.”

“I
know.
If
I
kept
you
ignorant
too
long,
it
was
only
to
protect
you.
Arianne,
your
nature...
to
you,
a
secret
was
only
a
choice
tale
to
whisper
to
Garin
and
Tyene
in
your
bed
of
a
night.
Garin
gossips
as
only
the
orphans
can,
and
Tyene
keeps
nothing
from
Obara
and
the
Lady
Nym.
And
if
they
knew...
Obara
is
too
fond
of
wine,
and
Nym
is
too
close
to
the
Fowler
twins.
And
who
might
the
Fowler
twins
confide
in?
I
could
not
take
the
risk.”

She
was
lost,
confounded.
Promised.
I
was
promised.
“Who
is
it?
Who
have
I
been
betrothed
to,
all
these
years?”

“It
makes
no
matter.
He
is
dead.”

That
left
her
more
baffled
than
ever.
“The
old
ones
are
so
frail.
Was
it
a
broken
hip,
a
chill,
the
gout?”

“It
was
a
pot
of
molten
gold.
We
princes
make
our
careful
plans
and
the
gods
smash
them
all
awry.”
Prince
Doran
made
a
weary
gesture
with
a
chafed
red
hand.
“Dorne
will
be
yours.
You
have
my
word
on
that,
if
my
word
still
has
any
meaning
for
you.
Your
brother
Quentyn
has
a
harder
road
to
walk.”

“What
road?”
Arianne
regarded
him
suspiciously.
“What
are
you
holding
back?
Seven
save
me,
but
I
am
sick
of
secrets.
Tell
me
the
rest,
Father...
or
else
name
Quentyn
your
heir
and
send
for
Hotah
and
his
axe,
and
let
me
die
beside
my
cousins.”

“Do
you
truly
believe
I
would
harm
my
brother’s
children?”
Her
father
grimaced.
“Obara,
Nym,
and
Tyene
lack
for
nothing
but
their
freedom,
and
Ellaria
and
her
daughters
are
happily
ensconced
at
the
Water
Gardens.
Dorea
stalks
about
knocking
oranges
off
the
trees
with
her
morningstar,
and
Elia
and
Obella
have
become
the
terror
of
the
pools.”
He
sighed.
“It
has
not
been
so
long
since
you
were
playing
in
those
pools.
You
used
to
ride
the
shoulders
of
an
older
girl...
a
tall
girl
with
wispy
yellow
hair...”

“Jeyne
Fowler,
or
her
sister
Jennelyn.”
It
had
been
years
since
Arianne
had
thought
of
that.
“Oh,
and
Frynne,
her
father
was
a
smith.
Her
hair
was
brown.
Garin
was
my
favorite,
though.
When
I
rode
Garin
no
one
could
defeat
us,
not
even
Nym
and
that
green-haired
Tyroshi
girl.”

“That
green-haired
girl
was
the
Archon’s
daughter.
I
was
to
have
sent
you
to
Tyrosh
in
her
place.
You
would
have
served
the
Archon
as
a
cupbearer
and
met
with
your
betrothed
in
secret,
but
your
mother
threatened
to
harm
herself
if
I
stole
another
of
her
children,
and
I...
I
could
not
do
that
to
her.”

His
tale
grows
ever
stranger.
“Is
that
where
Quentyn’s
gone?
To
Tyrosh,
to
court
the
Archon’s
green-haired
daughter?”

Her
father
plucked
up
a
cyvasse
piece.
“I
must
know
how
you
learned
that
Quentyn
was
abroad.
Your
brother
went
with
Cletus
Yronwood,
Maester
Kedry,
and
three
of
Lord
Yronwood’s
best
young
knights
on
a
long
and
perilous
voyage,
with
an
uncertain
welcome
at
its
end.
He
has
gone
to
bring
us
back
our
heart’s
desire.”

She
narrowed
her
eyes.
“What
is
our
heart’s
desire?”

“Vengeance.”
His
voice
was
soft,
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
someone
might
be
listening.
“Justice.”
Prince
Doran
pressed
the
onyx
dragon
into
her
palm
with
his
swollen,
gouty
fingers,
and
whispered,
“Fire
and
blood.”





ALAYNE

She
turned
the
iron
ring
and
pushed
the
door
open,
just
a
crack.
“Sweetrobin?”
she
called.
“May
I
enter?”

“Have
a
care,
m’lady,”
warned
old
Gretchel,
wringing
her
hands.
“His
lordship
threw
his
chamber
pot
at
the
maester.”

“Then
he
has
none
to
throw
at
me.
Isn’t
there
some
work
you
should
be
doing?
And
you,
Maddy...
are
all
the
windows
closed
and
shuttered?
Have
all
the
furnishings
been
covered?”

“All
of
them,
m’lady,”
said
Maddy.

“Best
make
certain
of
it.”
Alayne
slipped
into
the
darkened
bedchamber.
“It’s
only
me,
Sweetrobin.”

Someone
sniffled
in
the
darkness.
“Are
you
alone?”

“I
am,
my
lord.”

“Come
close,
then.
Just
you.”

Alayne
shut
the
door
firmly
behind
her.
It
was
solid
oak,
four
inches
thick;
Maddy
and
Gretchel
might
listen
all
they
wished,
but
they
would
hear
nothing.
That
was
just
as
well.
Gretchel
could
hold
her
tongue,
but
Maddy
gossiped
shamelessly.

“Did
Maester
Colemon
send
you?”
the
boy
asked.

“No,”
she
lied.
“I
heard
my
Sweetrobin
was
ailing.”
After
his
encounter
with
the
chamber
pot
the
maester
had
come
running
to
Ser
Lothor,
and
Brune
had
come
to
her.
“If
m’lady
can
talk
him
out
of
bed
nice,”
the
knight
said,
“I
won’t
have
to
drag
him
out.”

We
can’t
have
that,
she
told
herself.
When
Robert
was
handled
roughly
he
was
apt
to
go
into
a
shaking
fit.
“Are
you
hungry,
my
lord?”
she
asked
the
little
lord.
“Shall
I
send
Maddy
down
for
berries
and
cream,
or
some
warm
bread
and
butter?”
Too
late
she
remembered
that
there
was
no
warm
bread;
the
kitchens
were
closed,
the
ovens
cold.
If
it
gets
Robert
out
of
bed,
it
would
be
worth
the
bother
of
lighting
a
fire,
she
told
herself.

“I
don’t
want
food,”
the
little
lord
said,
in
a
reedy,
petulant
voice.
“I’m
going
to
stay
in
bed
today.
You
could
read
to
me
if
you
want.”

“It
is
too
dark
in
here
for
reading.”
The
heavy
curtains
drawn
across
the
windows
made
the
bedchamber
black
as
night.
“Has
my
Sweetrobin
forgotten
what
day
this
is?”

“No,”
he
said,
“but
I’m
not
going.
I
want
to
stay
in
bed.
You
could
read
to
me
about
the
Winged
Knight.”

The
Winged
Knight
was
Ser
Artys
Arryn.
Legend
said
that
he
had
driven
the
First
Men
from
the
Vale
and
flown
to
the
top
of
the
Giant’s
Lance
on
a
huge
falcon
to
slay
the
Griffin
King.
There
were
a
hundred
tales
of
his
adventures.
Little
Robert
knew
them
all
so
well
he
could
have
recited
them
from
memory,
but
he
liked
to
have
them
read
to
him
all
the
same.
“Sweetling,
we
have
to
go,”
she
told
the
boy,
“but
I
promise,
I’ll
read
you
two
tales
of
the
Winged
Knight
when
we
reach
the
Gates
of
the
Moon.”

“Three,”
he
said
at
once.
No
matter
what
you
offered
him,
Robert
always
wanted
more.

“Three,”
she
agreed.
“Might
I
let
some
sun
in?”

“No.
The
light
hurts
my
eyes.
Come
to
bed,
Alayne.”

She
went
to
the
windows
anyway,
edging
around
the
broken
chamber
pot.
She
could
smell
it
better
than
she
saw
it.
“I
shan’t
open
them
very
wide.
Only
enough
to
see
my
Sweetrobin’s
face.”

He
sniffled.
“If
you
must.”

The
curtains
were
of
plush
blue
velvet.
She
pulled
one
back
a
finger’s
length
and
tied
it
off.
Dust
motes
danced
in
a
shaft
of
pale
morning
light.
The
small
diamond-shaped
panes
of
the
window
were
obscured
by
frost.
Alayne
rubbed
at
one
with
the
heel
of
her
hand,
enough
to
glimpse
a
brilliant
blue
sky
and
a
blaze
of
white
from
the
mountainside.
The
Eyrie
was
wrapped
in
an
icy
mantle,
the
Giant’s
Lance
above
buried
in
waist-deep
snows.

When
she
turned
back,
Robert
Arryn
was
propped
up
against
the
pillows
looking
at
her.
The
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
and
Defender
of
the
Vale.
A
woolen
blanket
covered
him
below
the
waist.
Above
it
he
was
naked,
a
pasty
boy
with
hair
as
long
as
any
girl’s.
Robert
had
spindly
arms
and
legs,
a
soft
concave
chest
and
little
belly,
and
eyes
that
were
always
red
and
runny.
He
cannot
help
the
way
he
is.
He
was
born
small
and
sickly.
“You
look
very
strong
this
morning,
my
lord.”
He
loved
to
be
told
how
strong
he
was.
“Shall
I
have
Maddy
and
Gretchel
fetch
hot
water
for
your
bath?
Maddy
will
scrub
your
back
for
you
and
wash
your
hair,
to
make
you
clean
and
lordly
for
your
journey.
Won’t
that
be
nice?”

“No.
I
hate
Maddy.
She
has
a
wart
on
her
eye,
and
she
scrubs
so
hard
it
hurts.
My
mommy
never
hurt
me
scrubbing.”

“I
will
tell
Maddy
not
to
scrub
my
Sweetrobin
so
hard.
You’ll
feel
better
when
you’re
fresh
and
clean.”

“No
bath,
I
told
you,
my
head
hurts
most
awfully.”

“Shall
I
bring
you
a
warm
cloth
for
your
brow?
Or
a
cup
of
dreamwine?
Only
a
little
one,
though.
Mya
Stone
is
waiting
down
at
Sky,
and
she’ll
be
hurt
if
you
go
to
sleep
on
her.
You
know
how
much
she
loves
you.”

“I
don’t
love
her.
She’s
just
the
mule
girl.”
Robert
sniffled.
“Maester
Colemon
put
something
vile
in
my
milk
last
night,
I
could
taste
it.
I
told
him
I
wanted
sweetmilk,
but
he
wouldn’t
bring
me
any.
Not
even
when
I
commanded
him.
I
am
the
lord,
he
should
do
what
I
say.
No
one
does
what
I
say.”

“I’ll
speak
to
him,”
Alayne
promised,
“but
only
if
you
get
up
out
of
bed.
It’s
beautiful
outside,
Sweetrobin.
The
sun
is
shining
bright,
a
perfect
day
for
going
down
the
mountain.
The
mules
are
waiting
down
at
Sky
with
Mya...”

His
mouth
quivered.
“I
hate
those
smelly
mules.
One
tried
to
bite
me
once!
You
tell
that
Mya
that
I’m
staying
here.”
He
sounded
as
if
he
were
about
to
cry.
“No
one
can
hurt
me
so
long
as
I
stay
here.
The
Eyrie
is
impregnable.”

“Who
would
want
to
hurt
my
Sweetrobin?
Your
lords
and
knights
adore
you,
and
the
smallfolk
cheer
your
name.”
He
is
afraid,
she
thought,
and
with
good
reason.
Since
his
lady
mother
had
fallen,
the
boy
would
not
even
stand
upon
a
balcony,
and
the
way
from
the
Eyrie
to
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
was
perilous
enough
to
daunt
anyone.
Alayne’s
heart
had
been
in
her
throat
when
she
made
her
own
ascent
with
Lady
Lysa
and
Lord
Petyr,
and
everyone
agreed
that
the
descent
was
even
more
harrowing,
since
you
were
looking
down
the
whole
time.
Mya
could
tell
of
great
lords
and
bold
knights
who
had
gone
pale
and
wet
their
smallclothes
on
the
mountain.
And
none
of
them
had
the
shaking
sickness
either.

Still,
it
would
not
serve.
On
the
valley
floor
autumn
still
lingered,
warm
and
golden,
but
winter
had
closed
around
the
mountain
peaks.
They
had
weathered
three
snowstorms,
and
an
ice
storm
that
transformed
the
castle
into
crystal
for
a
fortnight.
The
Eyrie
might
be
impregnable,
but
it
would
soon
be
inaccessible
as
well,
and
the
way
down
grew
more
hazardous
every
day.
Most
of
the
castle’s
servants
and
soldiers
had
already
made
the
descent.
Only
a
dozen
still
lingered
up
here,
to
attend
Lord
Robert.

“Sweetrobin,”
she
said
gently,
“the
descent
will
be
ever
so
jolly,
you’ll
see.
Ser
Lothor
will
be
with
us,
and
Mya.
Her
mules
have
gone
up
and
down
this
old
mountain
a
thousand
times.”

“I
hate
mules,”
he
insisted.
“Mules
are
nasty.
I
told
you,
one
tried
to
bite
me
when
I
was
little.”

Robert
had
never
learned
to
ride
properly,
she
knew.
Mules,
horses,
donkeys,
it
made
no
matter;
to
him
they
were
all
fearsome
beasts,
as
terrifying
as
dragons
or
griffins.
He
had
been
brought
to
the
Vale
at
six,
riding
with
his
head
cradled
between
his
mother’s
milky
breasts,
and
had
never
left
the
Eyrie
since.

Still,
they
had
to
go,
before
the
ice
closed
about
the
castle
for
good.
There
was
no
telling
how
long
the
weather
would
hold.
“Mya
will
keep
the
mules
from
biting,”
Alayne
said,
“and
I’ll
be
riding
just
behind
you.
I’m
only
a
girl,
not
as
brave
or
strong
as
you.
If
I
can
do
it,
I
know
you
can,
Sweetrobin.”

“I
could
do
it,”
Lord
Robert
said,
“but
I
don’t
choose
to.”
He
swiped
at
his
runny
nose
with
the
back
of
his
hand.
“Tell
Mya
I
am
going
to
stay
abed.
Perhaps
I
will
come
down
on
the
morrow,
if
I
feel
better.
Today
is
too
cold
out,
and
my
head
hurts.
You
can
have
some
sweetmilk
too,
and
I’ll
tell
Gretchel
to
bring
us
some
honeycombs
to
eat.
We’ll
sleep
and
kiss
and
play
games,
and
you
can
read
me
about
the
Winged
Knight.”

“I
will.
Three
tales,
as
I
promised...
when
we
reach
the
Gates
of
the
Moon.”
Alayne
was
running
short
of
patience.
We
have
to
go,
she
reminded
herself,
or
we’ll
still
be
above
the
snow
line
when
the
sun
goes
down.
“Lord
Nestor
has
prepared
a
feast
to
welcome
you,
mushroom
soup
and
venison
and
cakes.
You
don’t
want
to
disappoint
him,
do
you?”

“Will
they
be
lemon
cakes?”
Lord
Robert
loved
lemon
cakes,
perhaps
because
Alayne
did.

“Lemony
lemony
lemon
cakes,”
she
assured
him,
“and
you
can
have
as
many
as
you
like.”

“A
hundred?”
he
wanted
to
know.
“Could
I
have
a
hundred?”

“If
it
please
you.”
She
sat
on
the
bed
and
smoothed
his
long,
fine
hair.
He
does
have
pretty
hair.
Lady
Lysa
had
brushed
it
herself
every
night,
and
cut
it
when
it
wanted
cutting.
After
she
had
fallen
Robert
had
suffered
terrible
shaking
fits
whenever
anyone
came
near
him
with
a
blade,
so
Petyr
had
commanded
that
his
hair
be
allowed
to
grow.
Alayne
wound
a
lock
around
her
finger,
and
said,
“Now,
will
you
get
out
of
bed
and
let
us
dress
you?”

“I
want
a
hundred
lemon
cakes
and
five
tales!”

I’d
like
to
give
you
a
hundred
spankings
and
five
slaps.
You
would
not
dare
behave
like
this
if
Petyr
were
here.
The
little
lord
had
a
good
healthy
fear
of
his
stepfather.
Alayne
forced
a
smile.
“As
my
lord
desires.
But
nothing
till
you’re
washed
and
dressed
and
on
your
way.
Come,
before
the
morning’s
gone.”
She
took
him
firmly
by
the
hand,
and
drew
him
out
of
bed.

Before
she
could
summon
the
servants,
however,
Sweetrobin
threw
his
skinny
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her.
It
was
a
little
boy’s
kiss,
and
clumsy.
Everything
Robert
Arryn
did
was
clumsy.
If
I
close
my
eyes
I
can
pretend
he
is
the
Knight
of
Flowers.
Ser
Loras
had
given
Sansa
Stark
a
red
rose
once,
but
he
had
never
kissed
her...
and
no
Tyrell
would
ever
kiss
Alayne
Stone.
Pretty
as
she
was,
she
had
been
born
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
blanket.

As
the
boy’s
lips
touched
her
own
she
found
herself
thinking
of
another
kiss.
She
could
still
remember
how
it
felt,
when
his
cruel
mouth
pressed
down
on
her
own.
He
had
come
to
Sansa
in
the
darkness
as
green
fire
filled
the
sky.
He
took
a
song
and
a
kiss,
and
left
me
nothing
but
a
bloody
cloak.

It
made
no
matter.
That
day
was
done,
and
so
was
Sansa.

Alayne
pushed
her
little
lord
away.
“That’s
enough.
You
can
kiss
me
again
when
we
reach
the
Gates,
if
you
keep
your
word.”

Maddy
and
Gretchel
were
waiting
outside
with
Maester
Colemon.
The
maester
had
washed
the
night
soil
from
his
hair
and
changed
his
robe.
Robert’s
squires
had
turned
up
as
well.
Terrance
and
Gyles
could
always
sniff
out
trouble.

“Lord
Robert
is
feeling
stronger,”
Alayne
told
the
serving
women.
“Fetch
hot
water
for
his
bath,
but
see
you
don’t
scald
him.
And
do
not
pull
on
his
hair
when
you
brush
out
the
tangles,
he
hates
that.”
One
of
the
squires
sniggered,
until
she
said,
“Terrance,
lay
out
his
lordship’s
riding
clothes
and
his
warmest
cloak.
Gyles,
you
may
clean
up
that
broken
chamber
pot.”

Gyles
Grafton
made
a
face.
“I’m
no
scrubwoman.”

“Do
as
Lady
Alayne
commands,
or
Lothor
Brune
will
hear
of
it,”
said
Maester
Colemon.
He
followed
her
along
the
hallway
and
down
the
twisting
stairs.
“I
am
grateful
for
your
intercession,
my
lady.
You
have
a
way
with
him.”
He
hesitated.
“Did
you
observe
any
shaking
while
you
were
with
him?”

“His
fingers
trembled
a
little
bit
when
I
held
his
hand,
that’s
all.
He
says
you
put
something
vile
in
his
milk.”

“Vile?”
Colemon
blinked
at
her,
and
the
apple
in
his
throat
moved
up
and
down.
“I
merely...
is
he
bleeding
from
the
nose?”

“No.”

“Good.
That
is
good.”
His
chain
clinked
softly
as
he
bobbed
his
head,
atop
a
ridiculously
long
and
skinny
neck.
“This
descent...
my
lady,
it
might
be
safest
if
I
mixed
his
lordship
some
milk
of
the
poppy.
Mya
Stone
could
lash
him
over
the
back
of
her
most
surefooted
mule
whilst
he
slumbered.”

“The
Lord
of
the
Eyrie
cannot
descend
from
his
mountain
tied
up
like
a
sack
of
barleycorn.”
Of
that
Alayne
was
certain.
They
dare
not
let
the
full
extent
of
Robert’s
frailty
and
cowardice
become
too
widely
known,
her
father
had
warned
her.
I
wish
he
were
here.
He
would
know
what
to
do.

Petyr
Baelish
was
clear
across
the
Vale,
though,
attending
Lord
Lyonel
Corbray
at
his
wedding.
A
widower
of
forty-odd
years,
and
childless,
Lord
Lyonel
was
to
wed
the
strapping
sixteen-year-old
daughter
of
a
rich
Gulltown
merchant.
Petyr
had
brokered
the
match
himself.
The
bride’s
dower
was
said
to
be
staggering;
it
had
to
be,
since
she
was
of
common
birth.
Corbray’s
vassals
would
be
there,
with
the
Lords
Waxley,
Grafton,
Lynderly,
some
petty
lords
and
landed
knights...
and
Lord
Belmore,
who
had
lately
reconciled
with
her
father.
The
other
Lords
Declarant
were
expected
to
shun
the
nuptials,
so
Petyr’s
presence
was
essential.

Alayne
understood
all
that
well
enough,
but
it
meant
that
the
burden
of
getting
Sweetrobin
safely
down
the
mountain
fell
on
her.
“Give
his
lordship
a
cup
of
sweetmilk,”
she
told
the
maester.
“That
will
stop
him
from
shaking
on
the
journey
down.”

“He
had
a
cup
not
three
days
past,”
Colemon
objected.

“And
wanted
another
last
night,
which
you
refused
him.”

“It
was
too
soon.
My
lady,
you
do
not
understand.
As
I’ve
told
the
Lord
Protector,
a
pinch
of
sweetsleep
will
prevent
the
shaking,
but
it
does
not
leave
the
flesh,
and
in
time...”

“Time
will
not
matter
if
his
lordship
has
a
shaking
fit
and
falls
off
the
mountain.
If
my
father
were
here,
I
know
he
would
tell
you
to
keep
Lord
Robert
calm
at
all
costs.”

“I
try,
my
lady,
yet
his
fits
grow
ever
more
violent,
and
his
blood
is
so
thin
I
dare
not
leech
him
any
more.
Sweetsleep...
you
are
certain
he
was
not
bleeding
from
the
nose?”

“He
was
sniffling,”
Alayne
admitted,
“but
I
saw
no
blood.”

“I
must
speak
to
the
Lord
Protector.
This
feast...
is
that
wise,
I
wonder,
after
the
strain
of
the
descent?”

“It
will
not
be
a
large
feast,”
she
assured
him.
“No
more
than
forty
guests.
Lord
Nestor
and
his
household,
the
Knight
of
the
Gate,
a
few
lesser
lords
and
their
retainers...”

“Lord
Robert
mislikes
strangers,
you
know
that,
and
there
will
be
drinking,
noise...
music.
Music
frightens
him.”

“Music
soothes
him,”
she
corrected,
“the
high
harp
especially.
It’s
singing
he
can’t
abide,
since
Marillion
killed
his
mother.”
Alayne
had
told
the
lie
so
many
times
that
she
remembered
it
that
way
more
oft
than
not;
the
other
seemed
no
more
than
a
bad
dream
that
sometimes
troubled
her
sleep.
“Lord
Nestor
will
have
no
singers
at
the
feast,
only
flutes
and
fiddles
for
the
dancing.”
What
would
she
do
when
the
music
began
to
play?
It
was
a
vexing
question,
to
which
her
heart
and
head
gave
different
answers.
Sansa
loved
to
dance,
but
Alayne...
“Just
give
him
a
cup
of
the
sweetmilk
before
we
go,
and
another
at
the
feast,
and
there
should
be
no
trouble.”

“Very
well.”
They
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs.
“But
this
must
be
the
last.
For
half
a
year,
or
longer.”

“You
had
best
take
that
up
with
the
Lord
Protector.”
She
pushed
through
the
door
and
crossed
the
yard.
Colemon
only
wanted
the
best
for
his
charge,
Alayne
knew,
but
what
was
best
for
Robert
the
boy
and
what
was
best
for
Lord
Arryn
were
not
always
the
same.
Petyr
had
said
as
much,
and
it
was
true.
Maester
Colemon
cares
only
for
the
boy,
though.
Father
and
I
have
larger
concerns.

Old
snow
cloaked
the
courtyard,
and
icicles
hung
down
like
crystal
spears
from
the
terraces
and
towers.
The
Eyrie
was
built
of
fine
white
stone,
and
winter’s
mantle
made
it
whiter
still.
So
beautiful,
Alayne
thought,
so
impregnable.
She
could
not
love
this
place,
no
matter
how
she
tried.
Even
before
the
guards
and
serving
men
had
made
their
descent,
the
castle
had
seemed
as
empty
as
a
tomb,
and
more
so
when
Petyr
Baelish
was
away.
No
one
sang
up
there,
not
since
Marillion.
No
one
ever
laughed
too
loud.
Even
the
gods
were
silent.
The
Eyrie
boasted
a
sept,
but
no
septon;
a
godswood,
but
no
heart
tree.
No
prayers
are
answered
here,
she
often
thought,
though
some
days
she
felt
so
lonely
she
had
to
try.
Only
the
wind
answered
her,
sighing
endlessly
around
the
seven
slim
white
towers
and
rattling
the
Moon
Door
every
time
it
gusted.
It
will
be
even
worse
in
winter,
she
knew.
In
winter
this
will
be
a
cold
white
prison.

And
yet
the
thought
of
leaving
frightened
her
almost
as
much
as
it
frightened
Robert.
She
only
hid
it
better.
Her
father
said
there
was
no
shame
in
being
afraid,
only
in
showing
your
fear.
“All
men
live
with
fear,”
he
said.
Alayne
was
not
certain
she
believed
that.
Nothing
frightened
Petyr
Baelish.
He
only
said
that
to
make
me
brave.
She
would
need
to
be
brave
down
below,
where
the
chance
of
being
unmasked
was
so
much
greater.
Petyr’s
friends
at
court
had
sent
him
word
that
the
queen
had
men
out
looking
for
the
Imp
and
Sansa
Stark.
It
will
mean
my
head
if
I
am
found,
she
reminded
herself
as
she
descended
a
flight
of
icy
stone
steps.
I
must
be
Alayne
all
the
time,
inside
and
out.

Lothor
Brune
was
in
the
winch
room,
helping
the
gaoler
Mord
and
two
serving
men
wrestle
chests
of
clothes
and
bales
of
cloth
into
six
huge
oaken
buckets,
each
big
enough
around
to
hold
three
men.
The
great
chain
winches
were
the
easiest
way
to
reach
the
waycastle
Sky,
six
hundred
feet
below
them;
elsewise
you
had
to
descend
the
natural
stone
chimney
from
the
undercellar.
Or
go
the
way
Marillion
went,
and
Lady
Lysa
before
him.

“Boy
out
of
bed?”
Ser
Lothor
asked.

“They’re
bathing
him.
He
will
be
ready
within
the
hour.”

“We
best
hope
he
is.
Mya
won’t
wait
past
midday.”
The
winch
room
was
unheated,
so
his
breath
misted
with
every
word.

“She’ll
wait,”
Alayne
said.
“She
has
to
wait.”

“Don’t
be
so
certain,
m’lady.
She’s
half
mule
herself,
that
one.
I
think
she’d
leave
us
all
to
starve
before
she’d
put
those
animals
at
risk.”
He
smiled
when
he
said
it.
He
always
smiles
when
he
speaks
of
Mya
Stone.
Mya
was
much
younger
than
Ser
Lothor,
but
when
her
father
had
been
brokering
the
marriage
between
Lord
Corbray
and
his
merchant’s
daughter,
he’d
told
her
that
young
girls
were
always
happiest
with
older
men.
“Innocence
and
experience
make
for
a
perfect
marriage,”
he
had
said.

Alayne
wondered
what
Mya
made
of
Ser
Lothor.
With
his
squashed
nose,
square
jaw,
and
nap
of
woolly
grey
hair,
Brune
could
not
be
called
comely,
but
he
was
not
ugly
either.
It
is
a
common
face
but
an
honest
one.
Though
he
had
risen
to
knighthood,
Ser
Lothor’s
birth
had
been
very
low.
One
night
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
kin
to
the
Brunes
of
Brownhollow,
an
old
knightly
family
from
Crackclaw
Point.
“I
went
to
them
when
my
father
died,”
he
confessed,
“but
they
shat
on
me,
and
said
I
was
no
blood
of
theirs.”
He
would
not
speak
of
what
happened
after
that,
except
to
say
that
he
had
learned
all
he
knew
of
arms
the
hard
way.
Sober,
he
was
a
quiet
man,
but
a
strong
one.
And
Petyr
says
he’s
loyal.
He
trusts
him
as
much
as
he
trusts
anyone.
Brune
would
be
a
good
match
for
a
bastard
girl
like
Mya
Stone,
she
thought.
It
might
be
different
if
her
father
had
acknowledged
her,
but
he
never
did.
And
Maddy
says
that
she’s
no
maid
either.

Mord
took
up
his
whip
and
cracked
it,
and
the
first
pair
of
oxen
began
to
lumber
in
a
circle,
turning
the
winch.
The
chain
uncoiled,
rattling
as
it
scraped
across
the
stone,
the
oaken
bucket
swaying
as
it
began
its
long
descent
to
Sky.
Poor
oxen,
thought
Alayne.
Mord
would
cut
their
throats
and
butcher
them
before
he
left,
and
leave
them
for
the
falcons.
Whatever
part
remained
when
the
Eyrie
was
reopened
would
be
roasted
up
for
the
spring
feast,
if
it
had
not
spoiled.
A
good
supply
of
hard
frozen
meat
foretold
a
summer
of
plenty,
old
Gretchel
claimed.

“M’lady,”
Ser
Lothor
said,
“you’d
best
know.
Mya
didn’t
come
up
alone.
Lady
Myranda’s
with
her.”

“Oh.”
Why
would
she
ride
all
the
way
up
the
mountain,
just
to
ride
back
down
again?
Myranda
Royce
was
the
Lord
Nestor’s
daughter.
The
one
time
that
Sansa
had
visited
the
Gates
of
the
Moon,
on
the
way
up
to
the
Eyrie
with
her
aunt
Lysa
and
Lord
Petyr,
she
had
been
away,
but
Alayne
had
heard
much
of
her
since
from
the
Eyrie’s
soldiers
and
serving
girls.
Her
mother
was
long
dead,
so
Lady
Myranda
kept
her
father’s
castle
for
him;
it
was
a
much
livelier
court
when
she
was
home
than
when
she
was
away,
according
to
rumor.
“Soon
or
late
you
must
meet
Myranda
Royce,”
Petyr
had
warned
her.
“When
you
do,
be
careful.
She
likes
to
play
the
merry
fool,
but
underneath
she’s
shrewder
than
her
father.
Guard
your
tongue
around
her.”

I
will,
she
thought,
but
I
did
not
know
I’d
need
to
start
so
soon.
“Robert
will
be
pleased.”
He
liked
Myranda
Royce.
“You
must
excuse
me,
ser.
I
need
to
finish
packing.”
Alone,
she
climbed
the
steps
back
to
her
room
for
one
last
time.
The
windows
had
been
sealed
and
shuttered,
the
furnishings
covered.
A
few
of
her
things
had
already
been
removed,
the
rest
stored
away.
All
of
Lady
Lysa’s
silks
and
samites
were
to
be
left
behind.
Her
sheerest
linens
and
plushest
velvets,
the
rich
embroidery
and
fine
Myrish
lace;
all
would
remain.
Down
below,
Alayne
must
dress
modestly,
as
befit
a
girl
of
modest
birth.
It
makes
no
matter,
she
told
herself.
I
dared
not
wear
the
best
clothes
even
here.

Gretchel
had
stripped
the
bed
and
laid
out
the
rest
of
her
clothing.
Alayne
was
already
wearing
woolen
hose
beneath
her
skirts,
over
a
double
layer
of
smallclothes.
Now
she
donned
a
lambswool
overtunic
and
a
hooded
fur
cloak,
fastening
it
with
an
enameled
mockingbird
that
had
been
a
gift
from
Petyr.
There
was
a
scarf
as
well,
and
a
pair
of
leather
gloves
lined
with
fur
to
match
her
riding
boots.
When
she’d
donned
it
all,
she
felt
as
fat
and
furry
as
a
bear
cub.
I
will
be
glad
of
it
on
the
mountain,
she
had
to
remind
herself.
She
took
one
last
look
at
her
room
before
she
left.
I
was
safe
here,
she
thought,
but
down
below...

When
Alayne
returned
to
the
winch
room,
she
found
Mya
Stone
waiting
impatiently
with
Lothor
Brune
and
Mord.
She
must
have
come
up
in
the
bucket
to
see
what
was
taking
us
so
long.
Slim
and
sinewy,
Mya
looked
as
tough
as
the
old
riding
leathers
she
wore
beneath
her
silvery
ringmail
shirt.
Her
hair
was
black
as
a
raven’s
wing,
so
short
and
shaggy
that
Alayne
suspected
that
she
cut
it
with
a
dagger.
Mya’s
eyes
were
her
best
feature,
big
and
blue.
She
could
be
pretty,
if
she
would
dress
up
like
a
girl.
Alayne
found
herself
wondering
whether
Ser
Lothor
liked
her
best
in
her
iron
and
leather,
or
dreamed
of
her
gowned
in
lace
and
silk.
Mya
liked
to
say
that
her
father
had
been
a
goat
and
her
mother
an
owl,
but
Alayne
had
gotten
the
true
story
from
Maddy.
Yes,
she
thought,
looking
at
her
now,
those
are
his
eyes,
and
she
has
his
hair
too,
the
thick
black
hair
he
shared
with
Renly.

“Where
is
he?”
the
bastard
girl
demanded.

“His
lordship
is
being
bathed
and
dressed.”

“He
needs
to
make
some
haste.
It’s
getting
colder,
can’t
you
feel
it?
We
need
to
get
below
Snow
before
the
sun
goes
down.”

“How
bad
is
the
wind?”
Alayne
asked
her.

“It
could
be
worse...
and
will
be,
after
dark.”
Mya
pushed
a
lock
of
hair
from
her
eyes.
“If
he
bathes
much
longer,
we’ll
be
trapped
up
here
all
winter
with
nothing
to
eat
except
each
other.”

Alayne
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
that.
Thankfully,
she
was
spared
by
the
arrival
of
Robert
Arryn.
The
little
lord
wore
sky-blue
velvet,
a
chain
of
gold
and
sapphires,
and
a
white
bearskin
cloak.
His
squires
each
held
an
end,
to
keep
the
cloak
from
dragging
on
the
floor.
Maester
Colemon
accompanied
them,
in
a
threadbare
grey
cloak
lined
with
squirrel
fur.
Gretchel
and
Maddy
were
not
far
behind.

When
he
felt
the
cold
wind
on
his
face,
Robert
quailed,
but
Terrance
and
Gyles
were
behind
him,
so
he
could
not
flee.
“My
lord,”
said
Mya,
“will
you
ride
down
with
me?”

Too
brusque,
Alayne
thought.
She
should
have
greeted
him
with
a
smile,
told
him
how
strong
and
brave
he
looks.

“I
want
Alayne,”
Lord
Robert
said.
“I’ll
only
go
with
her.”

“The
bucket
can
hold
all
three
of
us.”

“I
just
want
Alayne.
You
smell
all
stinky,
like
a
mule.”

“As
you
wish.”
Mya’s
face
showed
no
emotion.

Some
of
the
winch
chains
were
fixed
to
wicker
baskets,
others
to
stout
oaken
buckets.
The
largest
of
those
was
taller
than
Alayne,
with
iron
bands
girding
its
dark
brown
staves.
Even
so,
her
heart
was
in
her
throat
as
she
took
Robert’s
hand
and
helped
him
in.
Once
the
hatch
was
closed
behind
them,
the
wood
surrounded
them
on
all
sides.
Only
the
top
was
open.
It
is
best
that
way,
she
told
herself,
we
can’t
look
down.
Below
them
was
only
Sky
and
sky.
Six
hundred
feet
of
sky.
For
a
moment
she
found
herself
wondering
how
long
it
had
taken
her
aunt
to
fall
that
distance,
and
what
her
last
thought
had
been
as
the
mountain
rushed
up
to
meet
her.
No,
I
mustn’t
think
of
that.
I
mustn’t!

“AWAY!”
came
Ser
Lothor’s
shout.
Someone
shoved
the
bucket
hard.
It
swayed
and
tipped,
scraped
against
the
floor,
then
swung
free.
She
heard
the
crack
of
Mord’s
whip
and
the
rattle
of
the
chain.
They
began
to
descend,
by
jerks
and
starts
at
first,
then
more
smoothly.
Robert’s
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
puffy,
but
his
hands
were
still.
The
Eyrie
shrank
above
them.
The
sky
cells
on
the
lower
levels
made
the
castle
look
something
like
a
honeycomb
from
below.
A
honeycomb
made
of
ice,
Alayne
thought,
a
castle
made
of
snow.
She
could
hear
the
wind
whistling
round
the
bucket.

A
hundred
feet
down,
a
sudden
gust
caught
hold
of
them.
The
bucket
swayed
sideways,
spinning
in
the
air,
then
bumped
hard
against
the
rock
face
behind
them.
Shards
of
ice
and
snow
rained
down
on
them,
and
the
oak
creaked
and
strained.
Robert
gave
a
gasp
and
clung
to
her,
burying
his
face
between
her
breasts.

“My
lord
is
brave,”
Alayne
said,
when
she
felt
him
shaking.
“I’m
so
frightened
I
can
hardly
talk,
but
not
you.”

She
felt
him
nod.
“The
Winged
Knight
was
brave,
and
so
am
I,”
he
boasted
to
her
bodice.
“I’m
an
Arryn.”

“Will
my
Sweetrobin
hold
me
tight?”
she
asked,
though
he
was
already
holding
her
so
tightly
that
she
could
scarcely
breathe.

“If
you
like,”
he
whispered.
And
clinging
hard
to
one
another,
they
continued
on
straight
down
to
Sky.

Calling
this
a
castle
is
like
calling
a
puddle
on
a
privy
floor
a
lake,
Alayne
thought,
when
the
bucket
was
opened
so
they
might
emerge
within
the
waycastle.
Sky
was
no
more
than
a
crescent-shaped
wall
of
old
unmortared
stone,
enclosing
a
stony
ledge
and
the
yawning
mouth
of
a
cavern.
Inside
were
storehouses
and
stables,
a
long
natural
hall,
and
the
chiseled
handholds
that
led
up
to
the
Eyrie.
Outside,
the
ground
was
strewn
by
broken
stones
and
boulders.
Earthen
ramps
gave
access
to
the
wall.
Six
hundred
feet
above,
the
Eyrie
was
so
small
she
could
hide
it
with
her
hand,
but
far
below
the
Vale
stretched
green
and
golden.

Twenty
mules
awaited
them
within
the
waycastle,
along
with
two
mule-walkers
and
the
Lady
Myranda
Royce.
Lord
Nestor’s
daughter
proved
to
be
a
short,
fleshy
woman,
of
an
age
with
Mya
Stone,
but
where
Mya
was
slim
and
sinewy,
Myranda
was
soft-bodied
and
sweet-smelling,
broad
of
hip,
thick
of
waist,
and
extremely
buxom.
Her
thick
chestnut
curls
framed
round
red
cheeks,
a
small
mouth,
and
a
pair
of
lively
brown
eyes.
When
Robert
climbed
gingerly
from
the
bucket,
she
knelt
in
a
patch
of
snow
to
kiss
his
hand
and
cheeks.
“My
lord,”
she
said,
“you’ve
grown
so
big!”

“Have
I?”
said
Robert,
pleased.

“You
will
be
taller
than
me
soon,”
the
lady
lied.
She
got
to
her
feet
and
brushed
the
snow
from
her
skirts.
“And
you
must
be
the
Lord
Protector’s
daughter,”
she
added,
as
the
bucket
went
rattling
back
up
to
the
Eyrie.
“I
had
heard
that
you
were
beautiful.
I
see
that
it
is
true.”

Alayne
curtsied.
“My
lady
is
kind
to
say
so.”

“Kind?”
The
older
girl
gave
a
laugh.
“How
boring
that
would
be.
I
aspire
to
be
wicked.
You
must
tell
me
all
your
secrets
on
the
ride
down.
May
I
call
you
Alayne?”

“If
you
wish,
my
lady.”
But
you’ll
get
no
secrets
from
me.

“I
am
‘my
lady’
at
the
Gates,
but
up
here
on
the
mountain
you
may
call
me
Randa.
How
many
years
have
you,
Alayne?”

“Four-and-ten,
my
lady.”
She
had
decided
that
Alayne
Stone
should
be
older
than
Sansa
Stark.

“Randa.
It
seems
a
hundred
years
since
I
was
four-and-ten.
How
innocent
I
was.
Are
you
still
innocent,
Alayne?”

She
blushed.
“You
should
not...
yes,
of
course.”

“Saving
yourself
for
Lord
Robert?”
Lady
Myranda
teased.
“Or
is
there
some
ardent
squire
dreaming
of
your
favors?”

“No,”
said
Alayne,
even
as
Robert
said,
“She’s
my
friend.
Terrance
and
Gyles
can’t
have
her.”

A
second
bucket
had
arrived
by
then,
thumping
down
softly
on
a
mound
of
frozen
snow.
Maester
Colemon
emerged
with
the
squires
Terrance
and
Gyles.
The
next
winch
delivered
Maddy
and
Gretchel,
who
rode
with
Mya
Stone.
The
bastard
girl
wasted
no
time
taking
charge.
“We
don’t
want
to
get
bunched
up
on
the
mountain,”
she
told
the
other
mule
handlers.
“I’ll
take
Lord
Robert
and
his
companions.
Ossy,
you’ll
bring
down
Ser
Lothor
and
the
rest,
but
give
me
an
hour’s
lead.
Carrot,
you’ll
have
charge
of
their
chests
and
boxes.”
She
turned
to
Robert
Arryn,
her
black
hair
blowing.
“Which
mule
will
you
ride
today,
my
lord?”

“They’re
all
stinky.
I’ll
have
the
grey
one,
with
the
ear
chewed
off.
I
want
Alayne
to
ride
with
me.
And
Myranda
too.”

“Where
the
way
is
wide
enough.
Come,
my
lord,
let’s
get
you
on
your
mule.
There’s
a
smell
of
snow
in
the
air.”

It
was
another
half
hour
before
they
were
ready
to
set
out.
When
all
of
them
were
mounted
up,
Mya
Stone
gave
a
crisp
command,
and
two
of
Sky’s
men-at-arms
swung
the
gates
open.
Mya
led
them
out,
with
Lord
Robert
just
behind
her,
swaddled
in
his
bearskin
cloak.
Alayne
and
Myranda
Royce
followed,
then
Gretchel
and
Maddy,
then
Terrance
Lynderly
and
Gyles
Grafton.
Maester
Colemon
brought
up
the
rear,
leading
a
second
mule
laden
with
his
chests
of
herbs
and
potions.

Beyond
the
walls,
the
wind
picked
up
sharply.
They
were
above
the
tree
line
here,
exposed
to
the
elements.
Alayne
was
thankful
that
she’d
dressed
so
warmly.
Her
cloak
was
flapping
noisily
behind
her,
and
a
sudden
gust
blew
back
her
hood.
She
laughed,
but
a
few
yards
ahead
Lord
Robert
squirmed,
and
said,
“It’s
too
cold.
We
should
go
back
and
wait
until
it’s
warmer.”

“It
will
be
warmer
on
the
valley
floor,
my
lord,”
said
Mya.
“You’ll
see
when
we
get
down
there.”

“I
don’t
want
to
see,”
said
Robert,
but
Mya
paid
no
mind.

Their
road
was
a
crooked
series
of
stone
steps
carved
into
the
mountainside,
but
the
mules
knew
every
inch
of
it.
Alayne
was
glad
of
that.
Here
and
there
the
stone
was
shattered
from
the
strain
of
countless
seasons,
with
all
their
thaws
and
freezes.
Patches
of
snow
clung
to
the
rock
on
either
side
of
the
path,
blinding
white.
The
sun
was
bright,
the
sky
was
blue,
and
there
were
falcons
circling
overhead,
riding
on
the
wind.

Up
here
where
the
slope
was
steepest,
the
steps
wound
back
and
forth
rather
than
plunging
straight
down.
Sansa
Stark
went
up
the
mountain,
but
Alayne
Stone
is
coming
down.
It
was
a
strange
thought.
Coming
up,
Mya
had
warned
her
to
keep
her
eyes
on
the
path
ahead,
she
remembered.
“Look
up,
not
down,”
she
said...
but
that
was
not
possible
on
the
descent.
I
could
close
my
eyes.
The
mule
knows
the
way,
he
has
no
need
of
me.
But
that
seemed
more
something
Sansa
would
have
done,
that
frightened
girl.
Alayne
was
an
older
woman,
and
bastard
brave.

At
first
they
rode
in
single
file,
but
farther
down
the
path
widened
enough
for
two
to
ride
abreast,
and
Myranda
Royce
came
up
beside
her.
“We
have
had
a
letter
from
your
father,”
she
said,
as
casually
as
if
they
were
sitting
with
their
septa,
doing
needlework.
“He
is
on
his
way
home,
he
says,
and
hopes
to
see
his
darling
daughter
soon.
He
writes
that
Lyonel
Corbray
seems
well
pleased
with
his
bride,
and
even
more
so
with
her
dowry.
I
do
hope
Lord
Lyonel
remembers
which
one
he
needs
to
bed.
Lady
Waynwood
turned
up
with
the
Knight
of
Ninestars
for
the
wedding
feast,
Lord
Petyr
says,
to
everyone’s
astonishment.”

“Anya
Waynwood?
Truly?”
The
Lords
Declarant
were
down
from
six
to
three,
it
would
seem.
The
day
he’d
departed
the
mountain,
Petyr
Baelish
had
been
confident
of
winning
Symond
Templeton
to
his
side,
but
not
so
Lady
Waynwood.
“Was
there
more?”
she
asked.
The
Eyrie
was
such
a
lonely
place
that
she
was
eager
for
any
bit
of
news
from
the
world
beyond,
however
trivial
or
insignificant.

“Not
from
your
father,
no,
but
we’ve
had
other
birds.
The
war
goes
on,
everywhere
but
here.
Riverrun
has
yielded,
but
Dragonstone
and
Storm’s
End
still
hold
for
Lord
Stannis.”

“Lady
Lysa
was
so
wise,
to
keep
us
out
of
it.”

Myranda
gave
her
a
shrewd
little
smile.
“Yes,
she
was
the
very
soul
of
wisdom,
that
good
lady.”
She
shifted
her
seat.
“Why
must
mules
be
so
bony
and
ill-tempered?
Mya
does
not
feed
them
enough.
A
nice
fat
mule
would
be
more
comfortable
to
ride.
There’s
a
new
High
Septon,
did
you
know?
Oh,
and
the
Night’s
Watch
has
a
boy
commander,
some
bastard
son
of
Eddard
Stark’s.”

“Jon
Snow?”
she
blurted
out,
surprised.

“Snow?
Yes,
it
would
be
Snow,
I
suppose.”

She
had
not
thought
of
Jon
in
ages.
He
was
only
her
half
brother,
but
still...
with
Robb
and
Bran
and
Rickon
dead,
Jon
Snow
was
the
only
brother
that
remained
to
her.
I
am
a
bastard
too
now,
just
like
him.
Oh,
it
would
be
so
sweet,
to
see
him
once
again.
But
of
course
that
could
never
be.
Alayne
Stone
had
no
brothers,
baseborn
or
otherwise.

“Our
cousin
Bronze
Yohn
had
himself
a
mêlée
at
Runestone,”
Myranda
Royce
went
on,
oblivious,
“a
small
one,
just
for
squires.
It
was
meant
for
Harry
the
Heir
to
win
the
honors,
and
so
he
did.”

“Harry
the
Heir?”

“Lady
Waynwood’s
ward.
Harrold
Hardyng.
I
suppose
we
must
call
him
Ser
Harry
now.
Bronze
Yohn
knighted
him.”

“Oh.”
Alayne
was
confused.
Why
should
Lady
Waynwood’s
ward
be
her
heir?
She
had
sons
of
her
own
blood.
One
was
the
Knight
of
the
Bloody
Gate,
Ser
Donnel.
She
did
not
want
to
look
stupid,
though,
so
all
she
said
was,
“I
pray
he
proves
a
worthy
knight.”

Lady
Myranda
snorted.
“I
pray
he
gets
the
pox.
He
has
a
bastard
daughter
by
some
common
girl,
you
know.
My
lord
father
had
hoped
to
marry
me
to
Harry,
but
Lady
Waynwood
would
not
hear
of
it.
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
me
she
found
unsuitable,
or
just
my
dowry.”
She
gave
a
sigh.
“I
do
need
another
husband.
I
had
one
once,
but
I
killed
him.”

“You
did?”
Alayne
said,
shocked.

“Oh,
yes.
He
died
on
top
of
me.
In
me,
if
truth
be
told.
You
do
know
what
goes
on
in
a
marriage
bed,
I
hope?”

She
thought
of
Tyrion,
and
of
the
Hound
and
how
he’d
kissed
her,
and
gave
a
nod.
“That
must
have
been
dreadful,
my
lady.
Him
dying.
There,
I
mean,
whilst...
whilst
he
was...”

“...fucking
me?”
She
shrugged.
“It
was
disconcerting,
certainly.
Not
to
mention
discourteous.
He
did
not
even
have
the
common
decency
to
plant
a
child
in
me.
Old
men
have
weak
seed.
So
here
I
am,
a
widow,
but
scarce
used.
Harry
could
have
done
much
worse.
I
daresay
that
he
will.
Lady
Waynwood
will
most
like
marry
him
to
one
of
her
granddaughters,
or
one
of
Bronze
Yohn’s.”

“As
you
say,
my
lady.”
Alayne
remembered
Petyr’s
warning.

“Randa.
Come
now,
you
can
say
it.
Ran.
Da.”

“Randa.”

“Much
better.
I
fear
I
must
apologize
to
you.
You
will
think
me
a
dreadful
slut,
I
know,
but
I
bedded
that
pretty
boy
Marillion.
I
did
not
know
he
was
a
monster.
He
sang
beautifully,
and
could
do
the
sweetest
things
with
his
fingers.
I
would
never
have
taken
him
to
bed
if
I
had
known
he
was
going
to
push
Lady
Lysa
through
the
Moon
Door.
I
do
not
bed
monsters,
as
a
rule.”
She
studied
Alayne’s
face
and
chest.
“You
are
prettier
than
me,
but
my
breasts
are
larger.
The
maesters
say
large
breasts
produce
no
more
milk
than
small
ones,
but
I
do
not
believe
it.
Have
you
ever
known
a
wet
nurse
with
small
teats?
Yours
are
ample
for
a
girl
your
age,
but
as
they
are
bastard
breasts,
I
shan’t
concern
myself
with
them.”
Myranda
edged
her
mule
closer.
“You
know
our
Mya’s
not
a
maid,
I
trust?”

She
did.
Fat
Maddy
had
whispered
it
to
her,
one
time
when
Mya
brought
up
their
supplies.
“Maddy
told
me.”

“Of
course
she
did.
She
has
a
mouth
as
big
as
her
thighs,
and
her
thighs
are
enormous.
Mychel
Redfort
was
the
one.
He
used
to
be
Lyn
Corbray’s
squire.
A
real
squire,
not
like
that
loutish
lad
Ser
Lyn’s
got
squiring
for
him
now.
He
only
took
that
one
on
for
coin,
they
say.
Mychel
was
the
best
young
swordsman
in
the
Vale,
and
gallant...
or
so
poor
Mya
thought,
till
he
wed
one
of
Bronze
Yohn’s
daughters.
Lord
Horton
gave
him
no
choice
in
the
matter,
I
am
sure,
but
it
was
still
a
cruel
thing
to
do
to
Mya.”

“Ser
Lothor
is
fond
of
her.”
Alayne
glanced
down
at
the
mule
girl,
twenty
steps
below.
“More
than
fond.”

“Lothor
Brune?”
Myranda
raised
an
eyebrow.
“Does
she
know?”
She
did
not
wait
for
an
answer.
“He
has
no
hope,
poor
man.
My
father’s
tried
to
make
a
match
for
Mya,
but
she’ll
have
none
of
them.
She
is
half
mule,
that
one.”

Despite
herself,
Alayne
found
herself
warming
to
the
older
girl.
She
had
not
had
a
friend
to
gossip
with
since
poor
Jeyne
Poole.
“Do
you
think
Ser
Lothor
likes
her
as
she
is,
in
mail
and
leather?”
she
asked
the
older
girl,
who
seemed
so
worldly-wise.
“Or
does
he
dream
of
her
draped
in
silks
and
velvets?”

“He’s
a
man.
He
dreams
of
her
naked.”

She
is
trying
to
make
me
blush
again.

Lady
Myranda
must
have
heard
her
thoughts.
“You
do
turn
such
a
pretty
shade
of
pink.
When
I
blush
I
look
quite
like
an
apple.
I
have
not
blushed
for
years,
though.”
She
leaned
closer.
“Does
your
father
plan
to
wed
again?”

“My
father?”
Alayne
had
never
considered
that.
Somehow
the
notion
made
her
squirm.
She
found
herself
remembering
the
look
on
Lysa
Arryn’s
face
as
she’d
tumbled
through
the
Moon
Door.

“We
all
know
how
devoted
he
was
to
Lady
Lysa,”
said
Myranda,
“but
he
cannot
mourn
forever.
He
needs
a
pretty
young
wife
to
wash
away
his
grief.
I
imagine
he
could
have
his
pick
of
half
the
noble
maidens
in
the
Vale.
Who
could
be
a
better
husband
than
our
own
bold
Lord
Protector?
Though
I
do
wish
he
had
a
better
name
than
Littlefinger.
How
little
is
it,
do
you
know?”

“His
finger?”
She
blushed
again.
“I
don’t...
I
never...”

Lady
Myranda
laughed
so
loud
that
Mya
Stone
glanced
back
at
them.
“Never
you
mind,
Alayne,
I’m
sure
it’s
large
enough.”

They
passed
beneath
a
wind-carved
arch,
where
long
icicles
clung
to
the
pale
stone,
dripping
down
on
them.
On
the
far
side
the
path
narrowed
and
plunged
down
sharply
for
a
hundred
feet
or
more.
Myranda
was
forced
to
drop
back.
Alayne
gave
the
mule
his
head.
The
steepness
of
this
part
of
the
descent
made
her
cling
tightly
to
her
saddle.
The
steps
here
had
been
worn
smooth
by
the
iron-shod
hooves
of
all
the
mules
who’d
passed
this
way,
until
they
resembled
a
series
of
shallow
stone
bowls.
Water
filled
the
bottoms
of
the
bowls,
glimmering
golden
in
the
afternoon
sun.
It
is
water
now,
Alayne
thought,
but
come
dark,
all
of
it
will
turn
to
ice.
She
realized
that
she
was
holding
her
breath,
and
let
it
out.
Mya
Stone
and
Lord
Robert
had
almost
reached
the
rock
spire
where
the
slope
leveled
off
again.
She
tried
to
look
at
them,
and
only
them.
I
will
not
fall,
she
told
herself.
Mya’s
mule
will
see
me
through.
The
wind
skirled
around
her,
as
she
bumped
and
scraped
her
way
down
step
by
step.
It
seemed
to
take
a
lifetime.

Then
all
at
once
she
was
at
the
bottom
with
Mya
and
her
little
lord,
huddled
beneath
a
twisted,
rocky
spire.
Ahead
stretched
a
high
stone
saddle,
narrow
and
icy.
Alayne
could
hear
the
wind
shrieking,
and
feel
it
plucking
at
her
cloak.
She
remembered
this
place
from
her
ascent.
It
had
frightened
her
then,
and
it
frightened
her
now.
“It
is
wider
than
it
looks,”
Mya
was
telling
Lord
Robert
in
a
cheerful
voice.
“A
yard
across,
and
no
more
than
eight
yards
long,
that’s
nothing.”

“Nothing,”
Robert
said.
His
hand
was
shaking.

Oh,
no,
Alayne
thought.
Please.
Not
here.
Not
now.

“It’s
best
to
lead
the
mules
across,”
Mya
said.
“If
it
please
my
lord,
I’ll
take
mine
over
first,
then
come
back
for
yours.”
Lord
Robert
did
not
answer.
He
was
staring
at
the
narrow
saddle
with
his
reddened
eyes.
“I
shan’t
be
long,
my
lord,”
Mya
promised,
but
Alayne
doubted
that
the
boy
could
even
hear
her.

When
the
bastard
girl
led
her
mule
out
from
beneath
the
shelter
of
the
spire,
the
wind
caught
her
in
its
teeth.
Her
cloak
lifted,
twisting
and
flapping
in
the
air.
Mya
staggered,
and
for
half
a
heartbeat
it
seemed
as
if
she
would
be
blown
over
the
precipice,
but
somehow
she
regained
her
balance
and
went
on.

Alayne
took
Robert’s
gloved
hand
in
her
own
to
stop
his
shaking.
“Sweetrobin,”
she
said,
“I’m
scared.
Hold
my
hand,
and
help
me
get
across.
I
know
you’re
not
afraid.”

He
looked
at
her,
his
pupils
small
dark
pinpricks
in
eyes
as
big
and
white
as
eggs.
“I’m
not?”

“Not
you.
You’re
my
winged
knight,
Ser
Sweetrobin.”

“The
Winged
Knight
could
fly,”
Robert
whispered.

“Higher
than
the
mountains.”
She
gave
his
hand
a
squeeze.

Lady
Myranda
had
joined
them
by
the
spire.
“He
could,”
she
echoed,
when
she
saw
what
was
happening.

“Ser
Sweetrobin,”
Lord
Robert
said,
and
Alayne
knew
that
she
dare
not
wait
for
Mya
to
return.
She
helped
the
boy
dismount,
and
hand
in
hand
they
walked
out
onto
the
bare
stone
saddle,
their
cloaks
snapping
and
flapping
behind
them.
All
around
was
empty
air
and
sky,
the
ground
falling
away
sharply
to
either
side.
There
was
ice
underfoot,
and
broken
stones
just
waiting
to
turn
an
ankle,
and
the
wind
was
howling
fiercely.
It
sounds
like
a
wolf,
thought
Sansa.
A
ghost
wolf,
big
as
mountains.

And
then
they
were
on
the
other
side,
and
Mya
Stone
was
laughing
and
lifting
Robert
for
a
hug.
“Be
careful,”
Alayne
told
her.
“He
can
hurt
you,
flailing.
You
wouldn’t
think
so,
but
he
can.”
They
found
a
place
for
him,
a
cleft
in
the
rock
to
keep
him
out
of
the
cold
wind.
Alayne
tended
him
until
the
shaking
passed,
whilst
Mya
went
back
to
help
the
others
cross.

Fresh
mules
awaited
them
at
Snow,
and
a
hot
meal
of
stewed
goat
and
onions.
She
ate
with
Mya
and
Myranda.
“So
you’re
brave
as
well
as
beautiful,”
Myranda
said
to
her.

“No.”
The
compliment
made
her
blush.
“I’m
not.
I
was
so
scared.
I
don’t
think
I
could
have
crossed
without
Lord
Robert.”
She
turned
to
Mya
Stone.
“You
almost
fell.”

“You’re
mistaken.
I
never
fall.”
Mya’s
hair
had
tumbled
across
her
cheek,
hiding
one
eye.

“Almost,
I
said.
I
saw
you.
Weren’t
you
afraid?”

Mya
shook
her
head.
“I
remember
a
man
throwing
me
in
the
air
when
I
was
very
little.
He
stands
as
tall
as
the
sky,
and
he
throws
me
up
so
high
it
feels
as
though
I’m
flying.
We’re
both
laughing,
laughing
so
much
that
I
can
hardly
catch
a
breath,
and
finally
I
laugh
so
hard
I
wet
myself,
but
that
only
makes
him
laugh
the
louder.
I
was
never
afraid
when
he
was
throwing
me.
I
knew
that
he
would
always
be
there
to
catch
me.”
She
pushed
her
hair
back.
“Then
one
day
he
wasn’t.
Men
come
and
go.
They
lie,
or
die,
or
leave
you.
A
mountain
is
not
a
man,
though,
and
a
stone
is
a
mountain’s
daughter.
I
trust
my
father,
and
I
trust
my
mules.
I
won’t
fall.”
She
put
her
hand
on
a
jagged
spur
of
rock,
and
got
to
her
feet.
“Best
finish.
We
have
a
long
way
yet
to
go,
and
I
can
smell
a
storm.”

The
snow
began
to
fall
as
they
were
leaving
Stone,
the
largest
and
lowest
of
the
three
waycastles
that
defended
the
approaches
to
the
Eyrie.
Dusk
was
settling
by
then.
Lady
Myranda
suggested
that
perhaps
they
might
turn
back,
spend
the
night
at
Stone,
and
resume
their
descent
when
the
sun
came
up,
but
Mya
would
not
hear
of
it.
“The
snow
might
be
five
feet
deep
by
then,
and
the
steps
treacherous
even
for
my
mules,”
she
said.
“We
will
do
better
to
press
on.
We’ll
take
it
slow.”

And
so
they
did.
Below
Stone
the
steps
were
broader
and
less
steep,
winding
in
and
out
of
the
tall
pines
and
grey-green
sentinels
that
cloaked
the
lower
slopes
of
the
Giant’s
Lance.
Mya’s
mules
knew
every
root
and
rock
on
the
way
down,
it
seemed,
and
any
they
forgot
the
bastard
girl
remembered.
Half
the
night
was
gone
before
they
sighted
the
lights
of
the
Gates
of
the
Moon
through
the
falling
snow.
The
last
part
of
their
journey
was
the
most
peaceful.
The
snow
fell
steadily,
cloaking
all
the
world
in
white.
Sweetrobin
drifted
to
sleep
in
the
saddle,
swaying
back
and
forth
with
the
motion
of
his
mule.
Even
Lady
Myranda
began
to
yawn
and
complain
of
being
weary.
“We
have
apartments
prepared
for
all
of
you,”
she
told
Alayne,
“but
if
you
like
you
may
share
my
bed
tonight.
It’s
large
enough
for
four.”

“I
should
be
honored,
my
lady.”

“Randa.
Count
yourself
fortunate
that
I’m
so
tired.
All
I
want
to
do
is
curl
up
and
go
to
sleep.
Usually
when
ladies
share
my
bed
they
have
to
pay
a
pillow
tax
and
tell
me
all
about
the
wicked
things
they’ve
done.”

“What
if
they
haven’t
done
any
wicked
things?”

“Why,
then
they
must
confess
all
the
wicked
things
they
want
to
do.
Not
you,
of
course.
I
can
see
how
virtuous
you
are
just
by
looking
at
those
rosy
cheeks
and
big
blue
eyes
of
yours.”
She
yawned
again.
“I
hope
your
feet
are
warm.
I
do
hate
bedmaids
with
cold
feet.”

By
the
time
they
finally
reached
her
father’s
castle,
Lady
Myranda
was
drowsing
too,
and
Alayne
was
dreaming
of
her
bed.
It
will
be
a
featherbed,
she
told
herself,
soft
and
warm
and
deep,
piled
high
with
furs.
I
will
dream
a
sweet
dream,
and
when
I
wake
there
will
be
dogs
barking,
women
gossiping
beside
the
well,
swords
ringing
in
the
yard.
And
later
there
will
be
a
feast,
with
music
and
dancing.
After
the
deathly
silence
of
the
Eyrie,
she
yearned
for
shouts
and
laughter.

As
the
riders
were
climbing
off
their
mules,
however,
one
of
Petyr’s
guardsmen
emerged
from
within
the
keep.
“Lady
Alayne,”
he
said,
“the
Lord
Protector
has
been
waiting
for
you.”

“He’s
back?”
she
said,
startled.

“At
evenfall.
You’ll
find
him
in
the
west
tower.”

The
hour
was
closer
to
dawn
than
to
dusk,
and
most
of
the
castle
was
asleep,
but
not
Petyr
Baelish.
Alayne
found
him
seated
by
a
crackling
fire,
drinking
hot
mulled
wine
with
three
men
she
did
not
know.
They
all
rose
when
she
entered,
and
Petyr
smiled
warmly.
“Alayne.
Come,
give
your
father
a
kiss.”

She
hugged
him
dutifully
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek.
“I
am
sorry
to
intrude,
Father.
No
one
told
me
you
had
company.”

“You
are
never
an
intrusion,
sweetling.
I
was
just
now
telling
these
good
knights
what
a
dutiful
daughter
I
had.”

“Dutiful
and
beautiful,”
said
an
elegant
young
knight
whose
thick
blond
mane
cascaded
down
well
past
his
shoulders.

“Aye,”
said
the
second
knight,
a
burly
fellow
with
a
thick
salt-and-pepper
beard,
a
red
nose
bulbous
with
broken
veins,
and
gnarled
hands
as
large
as
hams.
“You
left
out
that
part,
m’lord.”

“I
would
do
the
same
if
she
were
my
daughter,”
said
the
last
knight,
a
short,
wiry
man
with
a
wry
smile,
pointed
nose,
and
bristly
orange
hair.
“Particularly
around
louts
like
us.”

Alayne
laughed.
“Are
you
louts?”
she
said,
teasing.
“Why,
I
took
the
three
of
you
for
gallant
knights.”

“Knights
they
are,”
said
Petyr.
“Their
gallantry
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated,
but
we
may
hope.
Allow
me
to
present
Ser
Byron,
Ser
Morgarth,
and
Ser
Shadrich.
Sers,
the
Lady
Alayne,
my
natural
and
very
clever
daughter...
with
whom
I
must
needs
confer,
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
excuse
us.”

The
three
knights
bowed
and
withdrew,
though
the
tall
one
with
the
blond
hair
kissed
her
hand
before
taking
his
leave.

“Hedge
knights?”
said
Alayne,
when
the
door
had
closed.

“Hungry
knights.
I
thought
it
best
that
we
have
a
few
more
swords
about
us.
The
times
grow
ever
more
interesting,
my
sweet,
and
when
the
times
are
interesting
you
can
never
have
too
many
swords.
The
Merling
King’s
returned
to
Gulltown,
and
old
Oswell
had
some
tales
to
tell.”

She
knew
better
than
to
ask
what
sort
of
tales.
If
Petyr
had
wanted
her
to
know,
he
would
have
told
her.
“I
did
not
expect
you
back
so
soon,”
she
said.
“I
am
glad
you’ve
come.”

“I
would
never
have
known
it
from
the
kiss
you
gave
me.”
He
pulled
her
closer,
caught
her
face
between
his
hands,
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
for
a
long
time.
“Now
that’s
the
sort
of
kiss
that
says
welcome
home.
See
that
you
do
better
next
time.”

“Yes,
Father.”
She
could
feel
herself
blushing.

He
did
not
hold
her
kiss
against
her.
“You
would
not
believe
half
of
what
is
happening
in
King’s
Landing,
sweetling.
Cersei
stumbles
from
one
idiocy
to
the
next,
helped
along
by
her
council
of
the
deaf,
the
dim,
and
the
blind.
I
always
anticipated
that
she
would
beggar
the
realm
and
destroy
herself,
but
I
never
expected
she
would
do
it
quite
so
fast.
It
is
quite
vexing.
I
had
hoped
to
have
four
or
five
quiet
years
to
plant
some
seeds
and
allow
some
fruits
to
ripen,
but
now...
it
is
a
good
thing
that
I
thrive
on
chaos.
What
little
peace
and
order
the
five
kings
left
us
will
not
long
survive
the
three
queens,
I
fear.”

“Three
queens?”
She
did
not
understand.

Nor
did
Petyr
choose
to
explain.
Instead,
he
smiled
and
said,
“I
have
brought
my
sweet
girl
back
a
gift.”

Alayne
was
as
pleased
as
she
was
surprised.
“Is
it
a
gown?”
She
had
heard
there
were
fine
seamstresses
in
Gulltown,
and
she
was
so
tired
of
dressing
drably.

“Something
better.
Guess
again.”

“Jewels?”

“No
jewels
could
hope
to
match
my
daughter’s
eyes.”

“Lemons?
Did
you
find
some
lemons?”
She
had
promised
Sweetrobin
lemon
cake,
and
for
lemon
cake
you
needed
lemons.

Petyr
Baelish
took
her
by
the
hand
and
drew
her
down
onto
his
lap.
“I
have
made
a
marriage
contract
for
you.”

“A
marriage...”
Her
throat
tightened.
She
did
not
want
to
wed
again,
not
now,
perhaps
not
ever.
“I
do
not...
I
cannot
marry.
Father,
I...”
Alayne
looked
to
the
door,
to
make
certain
it
was
closed.
“I
am
married,”
she
whispered.
“You
know.”

Petyr
put
a
finger
to
her
lips
to
silence
her.
“The
dwarf
wed
Ned
Stark’s
daughter,
not
mine.
Be
that
as
it
may.
This
is
only
a
betrothal.
The
marriage
must
needs
wait
until
Cersei
is
done
and
Sansa’s
safely
widowed.
And
you
must
meet
the
boy
and
win
his
approval.
Lady
Waynwood
will
not
make
him
marry
against
his
will,
she
was
quite
firm
on
that.”

“Lady
Waynwood?”
Alayne
could
hardly
believe
it.
“Why
would
she
marry
one
of
her
sons
to...
to
a...”

“...bastard?
For
a
start,
you
are
the
Lord
Protector’s
bastard,
never
forget.
The
Waynwoods
are
very
old
and
very
proud,
but
not
as
rich
as
one
might
think,
as
I
discovered
when
I
began
buying
up
their
debt.
Not
that
Lady
Anya
would
ever
sell
a
son
for
gold.
A
ward,
however...
young
Harry’s
only
a
cousin,
and
the
dower
that
I
offered
her
ladyship
was
even
larger
than
the
one
that
Lyonel
Corbray
just
collected.
It
had
to
be,
for
her
to
risk
Bronze
Yohn’s
wroth.
This
will
put
all
his
plans
awry.
You
are
promised
to
Harrold
Hardyng,
sweetling,
provided
you
can
win
his
boyish
heart...
which
should
not
be
hard,
for
you.”

“Harry
the
Heir?”
Alayne
tried
to
recall
what
Myranda
had
told
her
about
him
on
the
mountain.
“He
was
just
knighted.
And
he
has
a
bastard
daughter
by
some
common
girl.”

“And
another
on
the
way
by
a
different
wench.
Harry
can
be
a
beguiling
one,
no
doubt.
Soft
sandy
hair,
deep
blue
eyes,
and
dimples
when
he
smiles.
And
very
gallant,
I
am
told.”
He
teased
her
with
a
smile.
“Bastard-born
or
no,
sweetling,
when
this
match
is
announced
you
will
be
the
envy
of
every
highborn
maiden
in
the
Vale,
and
a
few
from
the
riverlands
and
the
Reach
as
well.”

“Why?”
Alayne
was
lost.
“Is
Ser
Harrold...
how
could
he
be
Lady
Waynwood’s
heir?
Doesn’t
she
have
sons
of
her
own
blood?”

“Three,”
Petyr
allowed.
She
could
smell
the
wine
on
his
breath,
the
cloves
and
nutmeg.
“Daughters
too,
and
grandsons.”

“Won’t
they
come
before
Harry?
I
don’t
understand.”

“You
will.
Listen.”
Petyr
took
her
hand
in
his
own
and
brushed
his
finger
lightly
down
the
inside
of
her
palm.
“Lord
Jasper
Arryn,
begin
with
him.
Jon
Arryn’s
father.
He
begot
three
children,
two
sons
and
a
daughter.
Jon
was
the
eldest,
so
the
Eyrie
and
the
lordship
passed
to
him.
His
sister
Alys
wed
Ser
Elys
Waynwood,
uncle
to
the
present
Lady
Waynwood.”
He
made
a
wry
face.
“Elys
and
Alys,
isn’t
that
precious?
Lord
Jasper’s
younger
son,
Ser
Ronnel
Arryn,
wed
a
Belmore
girl,
but
only
rang
her
once
or
twice
before
dying
of
a
bad
belly.
Their
son
Elbert
was
being
born
in
one
bed
even
as
poor
Ronnel
was
dying
in
another
down
the
hall.
Are
you
paying
close
attention,
sweetling?”

“Yes.
There
was
Jon
and
Alys
and
Ronnel,
but
Ronnel
died.”

“Good.
Now,
Jon
Arryn
married
thrice,
but
his
first
two
wives
gave
him
no
children,
so
for
long
years
his
nephew
Elbert
was
his
heir.
Meantime,
Elys
was
plowing
Alys
quite
dutifully,
and
she
was
whelping
once
a
year.
She
gave
him
nine
children,
eight
girls
and
one
precious
little
boy,
another
Jasper,
after
which
she
died
exhausted.
Boy
Jasper,
inconsiderate
of
the
heroic
efforts
that
had
gone
into
begetting
him,
got
himself
kicked
in
the
head
by
a
horse
when
he
was
three
years
old.
A
pox
took
two
of
his
sisters
soon
after,
leaving
six.
The
eldest
married
Ser
Denys
Arryn,
a
distant
cousin
to
the
Lords
of
the
Eyrie.
There
are
several
branches
of
House
Arryn
scattered
across
the
Vale,
all
as
proud
as
they
are
penurious,
save
for
the
Gulltown
Arryns,
who
had
the
rare
good
sense
to
marry
merchants.
They’re
rich,
but
less
than
couth,
so
no
one
talks
about
them.
Ser
Denys
hailed
from
one
of
the
poor,
proud
branches...
but
he
was
also
a
renowned
jouster,
handsome
and
gallant
and
brimming
with
courtesy.
And
he
had
that
magic
Arryn
name,
which
made
him
ideal
for
the
eldest
Waynwood
girl.
Their
children
would
be
Arryns,
and
the
next
heirs
to
the
Vale
should
any
ill
befall
Elbert.
Well,
as
it
happened,
Mad
King
Aerys
befell
Elbert.
You
know
that
story?”

She
did.
“The
Mad
King
murdered
him.”

“He
did
indeed.
And
soon
after,
Ser
Denys
left
his
pregnant
Waynwood
wife
to
ride
to
war.
He
died
during
the
Battle
of
the
Bells,
of
an
excess
of
gallantry
and
an
axe.
When
they
told
his
lady
of
his
death
she
perished
of
grief,
and
her
newborn
son
soon
followed.
No
matter.
Jon
Arryn
had
gotten
himself
a
young
wife
during
the
war,
one
he
had
reason
to
believe
fertile.
He
was
very
hopeful,
I’m
sure,
but
you
and
I
know
that
all
he
ever
got
from
Lysa
were
stillbirths,
miscarriages,
and
poor
Sweetrobin.

“Which
brings
us
back
to
the
five
remaining
daughters
of
Elys
and
Alys.
The
eldest
had
been
left
terribly
scarred
by
the
same
pox
that
killed
her
sisters,
so
she
became
a
septa.
Another
was
seduced
by
a
sellsword.
Ser
Elys
cast
her
out,
and
she
joined
the
silent
sisters
after
her
bastard
died
in
infancy.
The
third
wed
the
Lord
of
the
Paps,
but
proved
barren.
The
fourth
was
on
her
way
to
the
riverlands
to
marry
some
Bracken
when
Burned
Men
carried
her
off.
That
left
the
youngest,
who
wed
a
landed
knight
sworn
to
the
Waynwoods,
gave
him
a
son
that
she
named
Harrold,
and
perished.”
He
turned
her
hand
over
and
lightly
kissed
her
wrist.
“So
tell
me,
sweetling—why
is
Harry
the
Heir?”

Her
eyes
widened.
“He
is
not
Lady
Waynwood’s
heir.
He’s
Robert’s
heir.
If
Robert
were
to
die...”

Petyr
arched
an
eyebrow.
“When
Robert
dies.
Our
poor
brave
Sweetrobin
is
such
a
sickly
boy,
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time.
When
Robert
dies,
Harry
the
Heir
becomes
Lord
Harrold,
Defender
of
the
Vale
and
Lord
of
the
Eyrie.
Jon
Arryn’s
bannermen
will
never
love
me,
nor
our
silly,
shaking
Robert,
but
they
will
love
their
Young
Falcon...
and
when
they
come
together
for
his
wedding,
and
you
come
out
with
your
long
auburn
hair,
clad
in
a
maiden’s
cloak
of
white
and
grey
with
a
direwolf
emblazoned
on
the
back...
why,
every
knight
in
the
Vale
will
pledge
his
sword
to
win
you
back
your
birthright.
So
those
are
your
gifts
from
me,
my
sweet
Sansa...
Harry,
the
Eyrie,
and
Winterfell.
That’s
worth
another
kiss
now,
don’t
you
think?”





BRIENNE

This
is
an
evil
dream,
she
thought.
But
if
she
were
dreaming,
why
did
it
hurt
so
much?

The
rain
had
stopped
falling,
but
all
the
world
was
wet.
Her
cloak
felt
as
heavy
as
her
mail.
The
ropes
that
bound
her
wrists
were
soaked
through,
but
that
only
made
them
tighter.
No
matter
how
Brienne
turned
her
hands,
she
could
not
slip
free.
She
did
not
understand
who
had
bound
her,
or
why.
She
tried
to
ask
the
shadows,
but
they
did
not
answer.
Perhaps
they
did
not
hear
her.
Perhaps
they
were
not
real.
Under
her
layers
of
wet
wool
and
rusting
mail,
her
skin
was
flushed
and
feverish.
She
wondered
whether
all
of
this
was
just
a
fever
dream.

She
had
a
horse
beneath
her,
though
she
could
not
remember
mounting.
She
lay
facedown
across
his
hindquarters,
like
a
sack
of
oats.
Her
wrists
and
ankles
had
been
lashed
together.
The
air
was
damp,
the
ground
cloaked
in
mist.
Her
head
pounded
with
every
step.
She
could
hear
voices,
but
all
she
could
see
was
the
earth
beneath
the
horse’s
hooves.
There
were
things
broken
inside
of
her.
Her
face
felt
swollen,
her
cheek
was
sticky
with
blood,
and
every
jounce
and
bounce
send
a
stab
of
agony
through
her
arm.
She
could
hear
Podrick
calling
her,
as
if
from
far
away.
“Ser?”
he
kept
saying.
“Ser?
My
lady?
Ser?
My
lady?”
His
voice
was
faint
and
hard
to
hear.
Finally,
there
was
only
silence.

She
dreamt
she
was
at
Harrenhal,
down
in
the
bear
pit
once
again.
This
time
it
was
Biter
facing
her,
huge
and
bald
and
maggot-white,
with
weeping
sores
upon
his
cheeks.
Naked
he
came,
fondling
his
member,
gnashing
his
filed
teeth
together.
Brienne
fled
from
him.
“My
sword,”
she
called.
“Oathkeeper.
Please.”
The
watchers
did
not
answer.
Renly
was
there,
with
Nimble
Dick
and
Catelyn
Stark.
Shagwell,
Pyg,
and
Timeon
had
come,
and
the
corpses
from
the
trees
with
their
sunken
cheeks,
swollen
tongues,
and
empty
eye
sockets.
Brienne
wailed
in
horror
at
the
sight
of
them,
and
Biter
grabbed
her
arm
and
yanked
her
close
and
tore
a
chunk
from
her
face.
“Jaime,”
she
heard
herself
scream,
“Jaime.”

Even
in
the
depths
of
dream
the
pain
was
there.
Her
face
throbbed.
Her
shoulder
bled.
Breathing
hurt.
The
pain
crackled
up
her
arm
like
lightning.
She
cried
out
for
a
maester.

“We
have
no
maester,”
said
a
girl’s
voice.
“Only
me.”

I
am
looking
for
a
girl,
Brienne
remembered.
A
highborn
maid
of
three-and-ten,
with
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.
“My
lady?”
she
said.
“Lady
Sansa?”

A
man
laughed.
“She
thinks
you’re
Sansa
Stark.”

“She
can’t
go
much
farther.
She’ll
die.”

“One
less
lion.
I
won’t
weep.”

Brienne
heard
the
sound
of
someone
praying.
She
thought
of
Septon
Meribald,
but
all
the
words
were
wrong.
The
night
is
dark
and
full
of
terrors,
and
so
are
dreams.

They
were
riding
through
a
gloomy
wood,
a
dank,
dark,
silent
place
where
the
pines
pressed
close.
The
ground
was
soft
beneath
her
horse’s
hooves,
and
the
tracks
she
left
behind
filled
up
with
blood.
Beside
her
rode
Lord
Renly,
Dick
Crabb,
and
Vargo
Hoat.
Blood
ran
from
Renly’s
throat.
The
Goat’s
torn
ear
oozed
pus.
“Where
are
we
going?”
Brienne
asked.
“Where
are
you
taking
me?”
None
of
them
would
answer.
How
can
they
answer?
All
of
them
are
dead.
Did
that
mean
that
she
was
dead
as
well?

Lord
Renly
was
ahead
of
her,
her
sweet
smiling
king.
He
was
leading
her
horse
through
the
trees.
Brienne
called
out
to
tell
him
how
much
she
loved
him,
but
when
he
turned
to
scowl
at
her,
she
saw
that
he
was
not
Renly
after
all.
Renly
never
scowled.
He
always
had
a
smile
for
me,
she
thought...
except...

“Cold,”
her
king
said,
puzzled,
and
a
shadow
moved
without
a
man
to
cast
it,
and
her
sweet
lord’s
blood
came
washing
through
the
green
steel
of
his
gorget
to
drench
her
hands.
He
had
been
a
warm
man,
but
his
blood
was
cold
as
ice.
This
is
not
real,
she
told
herself.
This
is
another
bad
dream,
and
soon
I’ll
wake.

Her
mount
came
to
a
sudden
halt.
Rough
hands
seized
hold
of
her.
She
saw
shafts
of
red
afternoon
light
slanting
through
the
branches
of
a
chestnut
tree.
A
horse
rooted
amongst
the
dead
leaves
after
chestnuts,
and
men
moved
nearby,
talking
in
quiet
voices.
Ten,
twelve,
maybe
more.
Brienne
did
not
recognize
their
faces.
She
was
stretched
out
on
the
ground,
her
back
against
a
tree
trunk.
“Drink
this,
m’lady,”
said
the
girl’s
voice.
She
lifted
a
cup
to
Brienne’s
lips.
The
taste
was
strong
and
sour.
Brienne
spat
it
out.
“Water,”
she
gasped.
“Please.
Water.”

“Water
won’t
help
the
pain.
This
will.
A
little.”
The
girl
put
the
cup
to
Brienne’s
lips
again.

It
even
hurt
to
drink.
Wine
ran
down
her
chin
and
dribbled
on
her
chest.
When
the
cup
was
empty
the
girl
filled
it
from
a
skin.
Brienne
sucked
it
down
until
she
sputtered.
“No
more.”

“More.
You
have
a
broken
arm,
and
some
of
your
ribs
is
cracked.
Two,
maybe
three.”

“Biter,”
Brienne
said,
remembering
the
weight
of
him,
the
way
his
knee
had
slammed
into
her
chest.

“Aye.
A
real
monster,
that
one.”

It
all
came
back
to
her;
lightning
above
and
mud
below,
the
rain
pinging
softly
against
the
dark
steel
of
the
Hound’s
helm,
the
terrible
strength
in
Biter’s
hands.
Suddenly
she
could
not
stand
being
bound.
She
tried
to
wrench
free
of
her
ropes,
but
all
that
did
was
chafe
her
worse.
Her
wrists
were
tied
too
tightly.
There
was
dried
blood
on
the
hemp.
“Is
he
dead?”
She
trembled.
“Biter.
Is
he
dead?”
She
remembered
his
teeth
tearing
into
the
flesh
of
her
face.
The
thought
that
he
might
still
be
out
there
somewhere,
breathing,
made
Brienne
want
to
scream.

“He’s
dead.
Gendry
shoved
a
spearpoint
through
the
back
of
his
neck.
Drink,
m’lady,
or
I’ll
pour
it
down
your
throat.”

She
drank.
“I
am
looking
for
a
girl,”
she
whispered,
between
swallows.
She
almost
said
my
sister.
“A
highborn
maid
of
three-and-ten.
She
has
blue
eyes
and
auburn
hair.”

“I’m
not
her.”

No.
Brienne
could
see
that.
The
girl
was
thin
to
the
point
of
looking
starved.
She
wore
her
brown
hair
in
a
braid,
and
her
eyes
were
older
than
her
years.
Brown
hair,
brown
eyes,
plain.
Willow,
six
years
older.
“You’re
the
sister.
The
innkeep.”

“I
might
be.”
The
girl
squinted.
“What
if
I
am?”

“Do
you
have
a
name?”
Brienne
asked.
Her
stomach
gurgled.
She
was
afraid
that
she
might
retch.

“Heddle.
Same
as
Willow.
Jeyne
Heddle.”

“Jeyne.
Untie
my
hands.
Please.
Have
pity.
The
ropes
are
chafing
my
wrists.
I’m
bleeding.”

“It’s
not
allowed.
You’re
to
stay
bound,
till...”

“...till
you
stand
before
m’lady.”
Renly
stood
behind
the
girl,
pushing
his
black
hair
out
of
his
eyes.
Not
Renly.
Gendry.
“M’lady
means
for
you
to
answer
for
your
crimes.”

“M’lady.”
The
wine
was
making
her
head
spin.
It
was
hard
to
think.
“Stoneheart.
Is
that
who
you
mean?”
Lord
Randyll
had
spoken
of
her,
back
at
Maidenpool.
“Lady
Stoneheart.”

“Some
call
her
that.
Some
call
her
other
things.
The
Silent
Sister.
Mother
Merciless.
The
Hangwoman.”

The
Hangwoman.
When
Brienne
closed
her
eyes,
she
saw
the
corpses
swaying
underneath
the
bare
brown
limbs,
their
faces
black
and
swollen.
Suddenly
she
was
desperately
afraid.
“Podrick.
My
squire.
Where
is
Podrick?
And
the
others...
Ser
Hyle,
Septon
Meribald.
Dog.
What
did
you
do
with
Dog?”

Gendry
and
the
girl
exchanged
a
look.
Brienne
fought
to
rise,
and
managed
to
get
one
knee
under
her
before
the
world
began
to
spin.
“It
was
you
killed
the
dog,
m’lady,”
she
heard
Gendry
say,
just
before
the
darkness
swallowed
her
again.

Then
she
was
back
at
the
Whispers,
standing
amongst
the
ruins
and
facing
Clarence
Crabb.
He
was
huge
and
fierce,
mounted
on
an
aurochs
shaggier
than
he
was.
The
beast
pawed
the
ground
in
fury,
tearing
deep
furrows
in
the
earth.
Crabb’s
teeth
had
been
filed
into
points.
When
Brienne
went
to
draw
her
sword,
she
found
her
scabbard
empty.
“No,”
she
cried,
as
Ser
Clarence
charged.
It
wasn’t
fair.
She
could
not
fight
without
her
magic
sword.
Ser
Jaime
had
given
it
to
her.
The
thought
of
failing
him
as
she
had
failed
Lord
Renly
made
her
want
to
weep.
“My
sword.
Please,
I
have
to
find
my
sword.”

“The
wench
wants
her
sword
back,”
a
voice
declared.

“And
I
want
Cersei
Lannister
to
suck
my
cock.
So
what?”

“Jaime
called
it
Oathkeeper.
Please.”
But
the
voices
did
not
listen,
and
Clarence
Crabb
thundered
down
on
her
and
swept
off
her
head.
Brienne
spiraled
down
into
a
deeper
darkness.

She
dreamed
that
she
was
lying
in
a
boat,
her
head
pillowed
on
someone’s
lap.
There
were
shadows
all
around
them,
hooded
men
in
mail
and
leather,
paddling
them
across
a
foggy
river
with
muffled
oars.
She
was
drenched
in
sweat,
burning,
yet
somehow
shivering
too.
The
fog
was
full
of
faces.
“Beauty,”
whispered
the
willows
on
the
bank,
but
the
reeds
said,
“freak,
freak.”
Brienne
shuddered.
“Stop,”
she
said.
“Someone
make
them
stop.”

The
next
time
she
woke,
Jeyne
was
holding
a
cup
of
hot
soup
to
her
lips.
Onion
broth,
Brienne
thought.
She
drank
as
much
of
it
as
she
could,
until
a
bit
of
carrot
caught
in
her
throat
and
made
her
choke.
Coughing
was
agony.
“Easy,”
the
girl
said.

“Gendry,”
she
wheezed.
“I
have
to
talk
with
Gendry.”

“He
turned
back
at
the
river,
m’lady.
He’s
gone
back
to
his
forge,
to
Willow
and
the
little
ones,
to
keep
them
safe.”

No
one
can
keep
them
safe.
She
began
to
cough
again.
“Ah,
let
her
choke.
Save
us
a
rope.”
One
of
the
shadow
men
shoved
the
girl
aside.
He
was
clad
in
rusted
rings
and
a
studded
belt.
At
his
hip
hung
longsword
and
dirk.
A
yellow
greatcloak
was
plastered
to
his
shoulders,
sodden
and
filthy.
From
his
shoulders
rose
a
steel
dog’s
head,
its
teeth
bared
in
a
snarl.

“No,”
Brienne
moaned.
“No,
you’re
dead,
I
killed
you.”

The
Hound
laughed.
“You
got
that
backwards.
It’ll
be
me
killing
you.
I’d
do
it
now,
but
m’lady
wants
to
see
you
hanged.”

Hanged.
The
word
sent
a
jolt
of
fear
through
her.
She
looked
at
the
girl,
Jeyne.
She
is
too
young
to
be
so
hard.
“Bread
and
salt,”
Brienne
gasped.
“The
inn...
Septon
Meribald
fed
the
children...
we
broke
bread
with
your
sister...”

“Guest
right
don’t
mean
so
much
as
it
used
to,”
said
the
girl.
“Not
since
m’lady
come
back
from
the
wedding.
Some
o’
them
swinging
down
by
the
river
figured
they
was
guests
too.”

“We
figured
different,”
said
the
Hound.
“They
wanted
beds.
We
gave
’em
trees.”

“We
got
more
trees,
though,”
put
in
another
shadow,
one-eyed
beneath
a
rusty
pothelm.
“We
always
got
more
trees.”

When
it
was
time
to
mount
again,
they
yanked
a
leather
hood
down
over
her
face.
There
were
no
eyeholes.
The
leather
muffled
the
sounds
around
her.
The
taste
of
onions
lingered
on
her
tongue,
sharp
as
the
knowledge
of
her
failure.
They
mean
to
hang
me.
She
thought
of
Jaime,
of
Sansa,
of
her
father
back
on
Tarth,
and
was
glad
for
the
hood.
It
helped
hide
the
tears
welling
in
her
eyes.
From
time
to
time
she
heard
the
outlaws
talking,
but
she
could
not
make
out
their
words.
After
a
while
she
gave
herself
up
to
weariness
and
the
slow,
steady
motion
of
her
horse.

This
time
she
dreamed
that
she
was
home
again,
at
Evenfall.
Through
the
tall
arched
windows
of
her
lord
father’s
hall
she
could
see
the
sun
just
going
down.
I
was
safe
here.
I
was
safe.

She
was
dressed
in
silk
brocade,
a
quartered
gown
of
blue
and
red
decorated
with
golden
suns
and
silver
crescent
moons.
On
another
girl
it
might
have
been
a
pretty
gown,
but
not
on
her.
She
was
twelve,
ungainly
and
uncomfortable,
waiting
to
meet
the
young
knight
her
father
had
arranged
for
her
to
marry,
a
boy
six
years
her
senior,
sure
to
be
a
famous
champion
one
day.
She
dreaded
his
arrival.
Her
bosom
was
too
small,
her
hands
and
feet
too
big.
Her
hair
kept
sticking
up,
and
there
was
a
pimple
nestled
in
the
fold
beside
her
nose.
“He
will
bring
a
rose
for
you,”
her
father
promised
her,
but
a
rose
was
no
good,
a
rose
could
not
keep
her
safe.
It
was
a
sword
she
wanted.
Oathkeeper.
I
have
to
find
the
girl.
I
have
to
find
his
honor.

Finally
the
doors
opened,
and
her
betrothed
strode
into
her
father’s
hall.
She
tried
to
greet
him
as
she
had
been
instructed,
only
to
have
blood
come
pouring
from
her
mouth.
She
had
bitten
her
tongue
off
as
she
waited.
She
spat
it
at
the
young
knight’s
feet,
and
saw
the
disgust
on
his
face.
“Brienne
the
Beauty,”
he
said
in
a
mocking
tone.
“I
have
seen
sows
more
beautiful
than
you.”
He
tossed
the
rose
in
her
face.
As
he
walked
away,
the
griffins
on
his
cloak
rippled
and
blurred
and
changed
to
lions.
Jaime!
she
wanted
to
cry.
Jaime,
come
back
for
me!
But
her
tongue
lay
on
the
floor
by
the
rose,
drowned
in
blood.

Brienne
woke
suddenly,
gasping.

She
did
not
know
where
she
was.
The
air
was
cold
and
heavy,
and
smelled
of
earth
and
worms
and
mold.
She
was
lying
on
a
pallet
beneath
a
mound
of
sheepskins,
with
rock
above
her
head
and
roots
poking
through
the
walls.
The
only
light
came
from
a
tallow
candle,
smoking
in
a
pool
of
melted
wax.

She
pushed
aside
the
sheepskins.
Someone
had
stripped
her
of
her
clothes
and
armor,
she
saw.
She
was
clad
in
a
brown
woolen
shift,
thin
but
freshly
washed.
Her
forearm
had
been
splinted
and
bound
up
with
linen,
though.
One
side
of
her
face
felt
wet
and
stiff.
When
she
touched
herself,
she
found
some
sort
of
damp
poultice
covering
her
cheek
and
jaw
and
ear.
Biter...

Brienne
got
to
her
feet.
Her
legs
felt
weak
as
water,
her
head
as
light
as
air.
“Is
anyone
there?”

Something
moved
in
one
of
the
shadowed
alcoves
behind
the
candle;
an
old
grey
man
clad
in
rags.
The
blankets
that
had
covered
him
slipped
to
the
floor.
He
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes.
“Lady
Brienne?
You
gave
me
a
fright.
I
was
dreaming.”

No,
she
thought,
that
was
me.
“What
place
is
this?
Is
this
a
dungeon?”

“A
cave.
Like
rats,
we
must
run
back
to
our
holes
when
the
dogs
come
sniffing
after
us,
and
there
are
more
dogs
every
day.”
He
was
clad
in
the
ragged
remains
of
an
old
robe,
pink
and
white.
His
hair
was
long
and
grey
and
tangled,
the
loose
skin
of
his
cheeks
and
chin
was
covered
with
coarse
stubble.
“Are
you
hungry?
Could
you
keep
down
a
cup
of
milk?
Perhaps
some
bread
and
honey?”

“I
want
my
clothes.
My
sword.”
She
felt
naked
without
her
mail,
and
she
wanted
Oathkeeper
at
her
side.
“The
way
out.
Show
me
the
way
out.”
The
floor
of
the
cave
was
dirt
and
stone,
rough
beneath
the
soles
of
her
feet.
Even
now
she
felt
light-headed,
as
if
she
were
floating.
The
flickering
light
cast
queer
shadows.
Spirits
of
the
slain,
she
thought,
dancing
all
about
me,
hiding
when
I
turn
to
look
at
them.
Everywhere
she
saw
holes
and
cracks
and
crevices,
but
there
was
no
way
to
know
which
passages
led
out,
which
would
take
her
deeper
into
the
cave,
and
which
went
nowhere.
All
were
black
as
pitch.

“Might
I
feel
your
brow,
my
lady?”
Her
gaoler’s
hand
was
scarred
and
hard
with
callus,
yet
strangely
gentle.
“Your
fever
has
broken,”
he
announced,
in
a
voice
flavored
with
the
accents
of
the
Free
Cities.
“Well
and
good.
Just
yesterday
your
flesh
felt
as
if
it
were
on
fire.
Jeyne
feared
that
we
might
lose
you.”

“Jeyne.
The
tall
girl?”

“The
very
one.
Though
she
is
not
so
tall
as
you,
my
lady.
Long
Jeyne,
the
men
call
her.
It
was
she
who
set
your
arm
and
splinted
it,
as
well
as
any
maester.
She
did
what
she
could
for
your
face
as
well,
washing
out
the
wounds
with
boiled
ale
to
stop
the
mortification.
Even
so...
a
human
bite
is
a
filthy
thing.
That
is
where
the
fever
came
from,
I
am
certain.”
The
grey
man
touched
her
bandaged
face.
“We
had
to
cut
away
some
of
the
flesh.
Your
face
will
not
be
pretty,
I
fear.”

It
has
never
been
pretty.
“Scars,
you
mean?”

“My
lady,
that
creature
chewed
off
half
your
cheek.”

Brienne
could
not
help
but
flinch.
Every
knight
has
battle
scars,
Ser
Goodwin
had
warned
her,
when
she
asked
him
to
teach
her
the
sword.
Is
that
what
you
want,
child?
Her
old
master-at-arms
had
been
talking
about
sword
cuts,
though;
he
could
never
have
anticipated
Biter’s
pointed
teeth.
“Why
set
my
bones
and
wash
my
wounds
if
you
only
mean
to
hang
me?”

“Why
indeed?”
He
glanced
at
the
candle,
as
if
he
could
no
longer
bear
to
look
at
her.
“You
fought
bravely
at
the
inn,
they
tell
me.
Lem
should
not
have
left
the
crossroads.
He
was
told
to
stay
close,
hidden,
to
come
at
once
if
he
saw
smoke
rising
from
the
chimney...
but
when
word
reached
him
that
the
Mad
Dog
of
Saltpans
had
been
seen
making
his
way
north
along
the
Green
Fork,
he
took
the
bait.
We
have
been
hunting
that
lot
for
so
long...
still,
he
ought
to
have
known
better.
As
it
was,
it
was
half
a
day
before
he
realized
that
the
mummers
had
used
a
stream
to
hide
their
tracks
and
doubled
back
behind
him,
and
then
he
lost
more
time
circling
around
a
column
of
Frey
knights.
If
not
for
you,
only
corpses
might
have
remained
at
the
inn
by
the
time
that
Lem
and
his
men
got
back.
That
was
why
Jeyne
dressed
your
wounds,
mayhaps.
Whatever
else
you
may
have
done,
you
won
those
wounds
honorably,
in
the
best
of
causes.”

Whatever
else
you
may
have
done.
“What
is
it
that
you
think
I’ve
done?”
she
said.
“Who
are
you?”

“We
were
king’s
men
when
we
began,”
the
man
told
her,
“but
king’s
men
must
have
a
king,
and
we
have
none.
We
were
brothers
too,
but
now
our
brotherhood
is
broken.
I
do
not
know
who
we
are,
if
truth
be
told,
nor
where
we
might
be
going.
I
only
know
the
road
is
dark.
The
fires
have
not
shown
me
what
lies
at
its
end.”

I
know
where
it
ends.
I
have
seen
the
corpses
in
the
trees.
“Fires,”
Brienne
repeated.
All
at
once
she
understood.
“You
are
the
Myrish
priest.
The
red
wizard.”

He
looked
down
at
his
ragged
robes,
and
smiled
ruefully.
“The
pink
pretender,
rather.
I
am
Thoros,
late
of
Myr,
aye...
a
bad
priest
and
a
worse
wizard.”

“You
ride
with
the
Dondarrion.
The
lightning
lord.”

“Lightning
comes
and
goes
and
then
is
seen
no
more.
So
too
with
men.
Lord
Beric’s
fire
has
gone
out
of
this
world,
I
fear.
A
grimmer
shadow
leads
us
in
his
place.”

“The
Hound?”

The
priest
pursed
his
lips.
“The
Hound
is
dead
and
buried.”

“I
saw
him.
In
the
woods.”

“A
fever
dream,
my
lady.”

“He
said
that
he
would
hang
me.”

“Even
dreams
can
lie.
My
lady,
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
have
eaten?
Surely
you
are
famished?”

She
was,
she
realized.
Her
belly
felt
hollow.
“Food...
food
would
be
welcome,
thank
you.”

“A
meal,
then.
Sit.
We
will
talk
more,
but
first
a
meal.
Wait
here.”
Thoros
lit
a
taper
from
the
sagging
candle,
and
vanished
into
a
black
hole
beneath
a
ledge
of
rock.
Brienne
found
herself
alone
in
the
small
cave.
For
how
long,
though?

She
prowled
the
chamber,
looking
for
a
weapon.
Any
sort
of
weapon
would
have
served;
a
staff,
a
club,
a
dagger.
She
found
only
rocks.
One
fit
her
fist
nicely...
but
she
remembered
the
Whispers,
and
what
happened
when
Shagwell
tried
to
pit
a
stone
against
a
knife.
When
she
heard
the
priest’s
returning
footsteps,
she
let
the
rock
fall
to
the
cavern
floor
and
resumed
her
seat.

Thoros
had
bread
and
cheese
and
a
bowl
of
stew.
“I
am
sorry,”
he
said.
“The
last
of
the
milk
had
soured,
and
the
honey
is
all
gone.
Food
grows
scant.
Still,
this
will
fill
you.”

The
stew
was
cold
and
greasy,
the
bread
hard,
the
cheese
harder.
Brienne
had
never
eaten
anything
half
so
good.
“Are
my
companions
here?”
she
asked
the
priest,
as
she
was
spooning
up
the
last
of
the
stew.

“The
septon
was
set
free
to
go
upon
his
way.
There
was
no
harm
in
him.
The
others
are
here,
awaiting
judgment.”

“Judgment?”
She
frowned.
“Podrick
Payne
is
just
a
boy.”

“He
says
he
is
a
squire.”

“You
know
how
boys
will
boast.”

“The
Imp’s
squire.
He
has
fought
in
battles,
by
his
own
admission.
He
has
even
killed,
to
hear
him
tell
it.”

“A
boy,”
she
said
again.
“Have
pity.”

“My
lady,”
Thoros
said,
“I
do
not
doubt
that
kindness
and
mercy
and
forgiveness
can
still
be
found
somewhere
in
these
Seven
Kingdoms,
but
do
not
look
for
them
here.
This
is
a
cave,
not
a
temple.
When
men
must
live
like
rats
in
the
dark
beneath
the
earth,
they
soon
run
out
of
pity,
as
they
do
of
milk
and
honey.”

“And
justice?
Can
that
be
found
in
caves?”

“Justice.”
Thoros
smiled
wanly.
“I
remember
justice.
It
had
a
pleasant
taste.
Justice
was
what
we
were
about
when
Beric
led
us,
or
so
we
told
ourselves.
We
were
king’s
men,
knights,
and
heroes...
but
some
knights
are
dark
and
full
of
terror,
my
lady.
War
makes
monsters
of
us
all.”

“Are
you
saying
you
are
monsters?”

“I
am
saying
we
are
human.
You
are
not
the
only
one
with
wounds,
Lady
Brienne.
Some
of
my
brothers
were
good
men
when
this
began.
Some
were...
less
good,
shall
we
say?
Though
there
are
those
who
say
it
does
not
matter
how
a
man
begins,
but
only
how
he
ends.
I
suppose
it
is
the
same
for
women.”
The
priest
got
to
his
feet.
“Our
time
together
is
at
an
end,
I
fear.
I
hear
my
brothers
coming.
Our
lady
sends
for
you.”

Brienne
heard
their
footsteps
and
saw
torchlight
flickering
in
the
passage.
“You
told
me
she
had
gone
to
Fairmarket.”

“And
so
she
had.
She
returned
whilst
we
were
sleeping.
She
never
sleeps
herself.”

I
will
not
be
afraid,
she
told
herself,
but
it
was
too
late
for
that.
I
will
not
let
them
see
my
fear,
she
promised
herself
instead.
There
were
four
of
them,
hard
men
with
haggard
faces,
clad
in
mail
and
scale
and
leather.
She
recognized
one
of
them;
the
man
with
one
eye,
from
her
dreams.

The
biggest
of
the
four
wore
a
stained
and
tattered
yellow
cloak.
“Enjoy
the
food?”
he
asked.
“I
hope
so.
It’s
the
last
food
you’re
ever
like
to
eat.”
He
was
brown-haired,
bearded,
brawny,
with
a
broken
nose
that
had
healed
badly.
I
know
this
man,
Brienne
thought.
“You
are
the
Hound.”

He
grinned.
His
teeth
were
awful;
crooked,
and
streaked
brown
with
rot.
“I
suppose
I
am.
Seeing
as
how
m’lady
went
and
killed
the
last
one.”
He
turned
his
head
and
spat.

She
remembered
lightning
flashing,
the
mud
beneath
her
feet.
“It
was
Rorge
I
killed.
He
took
the
helm
from
Clegane’s
grave,
and
you
stole
it
off
his
corpse.”

“I
didn’t
hear
him
objecting.”

Thoros
sucked
in
his
breath
in
dismay.
“Is
this
true?
A
dead
man’s
helm?
Have
we
fallen
that
low?”

The
big
man
scowled
at
him.
“It’s
good
steel.”

“There
is
nothing
good
about
that
helm,
nor
the
men
who
wore
it,”
said
the
red
priest.
“Sandor
Clegane
was
a
man
in
torment,
and
Rorge
a
beast
in
human
skin.”

“I’m
not
them.”

“Then
why
show
the
world
their
face?
Savage,
snarling,
twisted...
is
that
who
you
would
be,
Lem?”

“The
sight
of
it
will
make
my
foes
afraid.”

“The
sight
of
it
makes
me
afraid.”

“Close
your
eyes,
then.”
The
man
in
the
yellow
cloak
made
a
sharp
gesture.
“Bring
the
whore.”

Brienne
did
not
resist.
There
were
four
of
them,
and
she
was
weak
and
wounded,
naked
beneath
the
woolen
shift.
She
had
to
bend
her
neck
to
keep
from
hitting
her
head
as
they
marched
her
through
the
twisting
passage.
The
way
ahead
rose
sharply,
turning
twice
before
emerging
in
a
much
larger
cavern
full
of
outlaws.

A
fire
pit
had
been
dug
into
the
center
of
the
floor,
and
the
air
was
blue
with
smoke.
Men
clustered
near
the
flames,
warming
themselves
against
the
chill
of
the
cave.
Others
stood
along
the
walls
or
sat
cross-legged
on
straw
pallets.
There
were
women
too,
and
even
a
few
children
peering
out
from
behind
their
mothers’
skirts.
The
one
face
Brienne
knew
belonged
to
Long
Jeyne
Heddle.

A
trestle
table
had
been
set
up
across
the
cave,
in
a
cleft
in
the
rock.
Behind
it
sat
a
woman
all
in
grey,
cloaked
and
hooded.
In
her
hands
was
a
crown,
a
bronze
circlet
ringed
by
iron
swords.
She
was
studying
it,
her
fingers
stroking
the
blades
as
if
to
test
their
sharpness.
Her
eyes
glimmered
under
her
hood.

Grey
was
the
color
of
the
silent
sisters,
the
handmaidens
of
the
Stranger.
Brienne
felt
a
shiver
climb
her
spine.
Stoneheart.

“M’lady,”
said
the
big
man.
“Here
she
is.”

“Aye,”
added
the
one-eyed
man.
“The
Kingslayer’s
whore.”

She
flinched.
“Why
would
you
call
me
that?”

“If
I
had
a
silver
stag
for
every
time
you
said
his
name,
I’d
be
as
rich
as
your
friends
the
Lannisters.”

“That
was
only...
you
do
not
understand...”

“Don’t
we,
though?”
The
big
man
laughed.
“I
think
we
might.
There’s
a
stink
of
lion
about
you,
lady.”

“That’s
not
so.”

Another
of
the
outlaws
stepped
forward,
a
younger
man
in
a
greasy
sheepskin
jerkin.
In
his
hand
was
Oathkeeper.
“This
says
it
is.”
His
voice
was
frosted
with
the
accents
of
the
north.
He
slid
the
sword
from
its
scabbard
and
placed
it
in
front
of
Lady
Stoneheart.
In
the
light
from
the
firepit
the
red
and
black
ripples
in
the
blade
almost
seem
to
move,
but
the
woman
in
grey
had
eyes
only
for
the
pommel:
a
golden
lion’s
head,
with
ruby
eyes
that
shone
like
two
red
stars.

“There
is
this
as
well.”
Thoros
of
Myr
drew
a
parchment
from
his
sleeve,
and
put
it
down
next
to
the
sword.
“It
bears
the
boy
king’s
seal
and
says
the
bearer
is
about
his
business.”

Lady
Stoneheart
set
the
sword
aside
to
read
the
letter.

“The
sword
was
given
me
for
a
good
purpose,”
said
Brienne.
“Ser
Jaime
swore
an
oath
to
Catelyn
Stark...”

“...before
his
friends
cut
her
throat
for
her,
that
must
have
been,”
said
the
big
man
in
the
yellow
cloak.
“We
all
know
about
the
Kingslayer
and
his
oaths.”

It
is
no
good,
Brienne
realized.
No
words
of
mine
will
sway
them.
She
plunged
ahead
despite
that.
“He
promised
Lady
Catelyn
her
daughters,
but
by
the
time
we
reached
King’s
Landing
they
were
gone.
Jaime
sent
me
out
to
seek
the
Lady
Sansa...”

“...and
if
you
had
found
the
girl,”
asked
the
young
northman,
“what
were
you
to
do
with
her?”

“Protect
her.
Take
her
somewhere
safe.”

The
big
man
laughed.
“Where’s
that?
Cersei’s
dungeon?”

“No.”

“Deny
it
all
you
want.
That
sword
says
you’re
a
liar.
Are
we
supposed
to
believe
the
Lannisters
are
handing
out
gold
and
ruby
swords
to
foes?
That
the
Kingslayer
meant
for
you
to
hide
the
girl
from
his
own
twin?
I
suppose
the
paper
with
the
boy
king’s
seal
was
just
in
case
you
needed
to
wipe
your
arse?
And
then
there’s
the
company
you
keep...”
The
big
man
turned
and
beckoned,
the
ranks
of
outlaws
parted,
and
two
more
captives
were
brought
forth.
“The
boy
was
the
Imp’s
own
squire,
m’lady,”
he
said
to
Lady
Stoneheart.
“T’other
is
one
of
Randyll
Bloody
Tarly’s
bloody
household
knights.”

Hyle
Hunt
had
been
beaten
so
badly
that
his
face
was
swollen
almost
beyond
recognition.
He
stumbled
as
they
shoved
him,
and
almost
fell.
Podrick
caught
him
by
the
arm.
“Ser,”
the
boy
said
miserably,
when
he
saw
Brienne.
“My
lady,
I
mean.
Sorry.”

“You
have
nothing
to
be
sorry
for.”
Brienne
turned
to
Lady
Stoneheart.
“Whatever
treachery
you
think
I
may
have
done,
my
lady,
Podrick
and
Ser
Hyle
were
no
part
of
it.”

“They’re
lions,”
said
the
one-eyed
man.
“That’s
enough.
I
say
they
hang.
Tarly’s
hanged
a
score
o’
ours,
past
time
we
strung
up
some
o’
his.”

Ser
Hyle
gave
Brienne
a
faint
smile.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
“you
should
have
wed
me
when
I
made
my
offer.
Now
I
fear
you’re
doomed
to
die
a
maid,
and
me
a
poor
man.”

“Let
them
go,”
Brienne
pleaded.

The
woman
in
grey
gave
no
answer.
She
studied
the
sword,
the
parchment,
the
bronze-and-iron
crown.
Finally
she
reached
up
under
her
jaw
and
grasped
her
neck,
as
if
she
meant
to
throttle
herself.
Instead
she
spoke...
Her
voice
was
halting,
broken,
tortured.
The
sound
seemed
to
come
from
her
throat,
part
croak,
part
wheeze,
part
death
rattle.
The
language
of
the
damned,
thought
Brienne.
“I
don’t
understand.
What
did
she
say?”

“She
asked
the
name
of
this
blade
of
yours,”
said
the
young
northman
in
the
sheepskin
jerkin.

“Oathkeeper,”
Brienne
answered.

The
woman
in
grey
hissed
through
her
fingers.
Her
eyes
were
two
red
pits
burning
in
the
shadows.
She
spoke
again.

“No,
she
says.
Call
it
Oathbreaker,
she
says.
It
was
made
for
treachery
and
murder.
She
names
it
False
Friend.
Like
you.”

“To
whom
have
I
been
false?”

“To
her,”
the
northman
said.
“Can
it
be
that
my
lady
has
forgotten
that
you
once
swore
her
your
service?”

There
was
only
one
woman
that
the
Maid
of
Tarth
had
ever
sworn
to
serve.
“That
cannot
be,”
she
said.
“She’s
dead.”

“Death
and
guest
right,”
muttered
Long
Jeyne
Heddle.
“They
don’t
mean
so
much
as
they
used
to,
neither
one.”

Lady
Stoneheart
lowered
her
hood
and
unwound
the
grey
wool
scarf
from
her
face.
Her
hair
was
dry
and
brittle,
white
as
bone.
Her
brow
was
mottled
green
and
grey,
spotted
with
the
brown
blooms
of
decay.
The
flesh
of
her
face
clung
in
ragged
strips
from
her
eyes
down
to
her
jaw.
Some
of
the
rips
were
crusted
with
dried
blood,
but
others
gaped
open
to
reveal
the
skull
beneath.

Her
face,
Brienne
thought.
Her
face
was
so
strong
and
handsome,
her
skin
so
smooth
and
soft.
“Lady
Catelyn?”
Tears
filled
her
eyes.
“They
said...
they
said
that
you
were
dead.”

“She
is,”
said
Thoros
of
Myr.
“The
Freys
slashed
her
throat
from
ear
to
ear.
When
we
found
her
by
the
river
she
was
three
days
dead.
Harwin
begged
me
to
give
her
the
kiss
of
life,
but
it
had
been
too
long.
I
would
not
do
it,
so
Lord
Beric
put
his
lips
to
hers
instead,
and
the
flame
of
life
passed
from
him
to
her.
And...
she
rose.
May
the
Lord
of
Light
protect
us.
She
rose.”

Am
I
dreaming
still?
Brienne
wondered.
Is
this
another
nightmare
born
from
Biter’s
teeth?
“I
never
betrayed
her.
Tell
her
that.
I
swear
it
by
the
Seven.
I
swear
it
by
my
sword.”

The
thing
that
had
been
Catelyn
Stark
took
hold
of
her
throat
again,
fingers
pinching
at
the
ghastly
long
slash
in
her
neck,
and
choked
out
more
sounds.
“Words
are
wind,
she
says,”
the
northman
told
Brienne.
“She
says
that
you
must
prove
your
faith.”

“How?”
asked
Brienne.

“With
your
sword.
Oathkeeper,
you
call
it?
Then
keep
your
oath
to
her,
milady
says.”

“What
does
she
want
of
me?”

“She
wants
her
son
alive,
or
the
men
who
killed
him
dead,”
said
the
big
man.
“She
wants
to
feed
the
crows,
like
they
did
at
the
Red
Wedding.
Freys
and
Boltons,
aye.
We’ll
give
her
those,
as
many
as
she
likes.
All
she
asks
from
you
is
Jaime
Lannister.”

Jaime.
The
name
was
a
knife,
twisting
in
her
belly.
“Lady
Catelyn,
I...
you
do
not
understand,
Jaime...
he
saved
me
from
being
raped
when
the
Bloody
Mummers
took
us,
and
later
he
came
back
for
me,
he
leapt
into
the
bear
pit
empty-handed...
I
swear
to
you,
he
is
not
the
man
he
was.
He
sent
me
after
Sansa
to
keep
her
safe,
he
could
not
have
had
a
part
in
the
Red
Wedding.”

Lady
Catelyn’s
fingers
dug
deep
into
her
throat,
and
the
words
came
rattling
out,
choked
and
broken,
a
stream
as
cold
as
ice.
The
northman
said,
“She
says
that
you
must
choose.
Take
the
sword
and
slay
the
Kingslayer,
or
be
hanged
for
a
betrayer.
The
sword
or
the
noose,
she
says.
Choose,
she
says.
Choose.”

Brienne
remembered
her
dream,
waiting
in
her
father’s
hall
for
the
boy
she
was
to
marry.
In
the
dream
she
had
bitten
off
her
tongue.
My
mouth
was
full
of
blood.
She
took
a
ragged
breath
and
said,
“I
will
not
make
that
choice.”

There
was
a
long
silence.
Then
Lady
Stoneheart
spoke
again.
This
time
Brienne
understood
her
words.
There
were
only
two.
“Hang
them,”
she
croaked.

“As
you
command,
m’lady,”
said
the
big
man.

They
bound
Brienne’s
wrists
with
rope
again
and
led
her
from
the
cavern,
up
a
twisting
stony
path
to
the
surface.
It
was
morning
outside,
she
was
surprised
to
see.
Shafts
of
pale
dawn
light
were
slanting
through
the
trees.
So
many
trees
to
choose
from,
she
thought.
They
will
not
need
to
take
us
far.

Nor
did
they.
Beneath
a
crooked
willow,
the
outlaws
slipped
a
noose
about
her
neck,
jerked
it
tight,
and
tossed
the
other
end
of
the
rope
over
a
limb.
Hyle
Hunt
and
Podrick
Payne
were
given
elms.
Ser
Hyle
was
shouting
that
he
would
kill
Jaime
Lannister,
but
the
Hound
cuffed
him
across
the
face
and
shut
him
up.
He
had
donned
the
helm
again.
“If
you
got
crimes
to
confess
to
your
gods,
this
would
be
the
time
to
say
them.”

“Podrick
has
never
harmed
you.
My
father
will
ransom
him.
Tarth
is
called
the
sapphire
isle.
Send
Podrick
with
my
bones
to
Evenfall,
and
you’ll
have
sapphires,
silver,
whatever
you
want.”

“I
want
my
wife
and
daughter
back,”
said
the
Hound.
“Can
your
father
give
me
that?
If
not,
he
can
get
buggered.
The
boy
will
rot
beside
you.
Wolves
will
gnaw
your
bones.”

“Do
you
mean
to
hang
her,
Lem?”
asked
the
one-eyed
man.
“Or
do
you
figure
to
talk
the
bitch
to
death?”

The
Hound
snatched
the
end
of
the
rope
from
the
man
holding
it.
“Let’s
see
if
she
can
dance,”
he
said,
and
gave
a
yank.

Brienne
felt
the
hemp
constricting,
digging
into
her
skin,
jerking
her
chin
upward.
Ser
Hyle
was
cursing
them
eloquently,
but
not
the
boy.
Podrick
never
lifted
his
eyes,
not
even
when
his
feet
were
jerked
up
off
the
ground.
If
this
is
another
dream,
it
is
time
for
me
to
awaken.
If
this
is
real,
it
is
time
for
me
to
die.
All
she
could
see
was
Podrick,
the
noose
around
his
thin
neck,
his
legs
twitching.
Her
mouth
opened.
Pod
was
kicking,
choking,
dying.
Brienne
sucked
the
air
in
desperately,
even
as
the
rope
was
strangling
her.
Nothing
had
ever
hurt
so
much.

She
screamed
a
word.





CERSEI

Septa
Moelle
was
a
white-haired
harridan
with
a
face
as
sharp
as
an
axe
and
lips
pursed
in
perpetual
disapproval.
This
one
still
has
her
maidenhead,
I’ll
wager,
Cersei
thought,
though
by
now
it’s
hard
and
stiff
as
boiled
leather.
Six
of
the
High
Sparrow’s
knights
escorted
her,
with
the
rainbow
sword
of
their
reborn
order
emblazoned
on
their
kite
shields.

“Septa.”
Cersei
sat
beneath
the
Iron
Throne,
clad
in
green
silk
and
golden
lace.
“Tell
his
High
Holiness
that
we
are
vexed
with
him.
He
presumes
too
much.”
Emeralds
glimmered
on
her
fingers
and
in
her
golden
hair.
The
eyes
of
court
and
city
were
upon
her,
and
she
meant
for
them
to
see
Lord
Tywin’s
daughter.
By
the
time
this
mummer’s
farce
was
done
they
would
know
they
had
but
one
true
queen.
But
first
we
must
dance
the
dance
and
never
miss
a
step.
“Lady
Margaery
is
my
son’s
true
and
gentle
wife,
his
helpmate
and
consort.
His
High
Holiness
had
no
cause
to
lay
his
hands
upon
her
person,
or
to
confine
her
and
her
young
cousins,
who
are
so
dear
to
all
of
us.
I
demand
that
he
release
them.”

Septa
Moelle’s
stern
expression
did
not
flicker.
“I
shall
convey
Your
Grace’s
words
to
His
High
Holiness,
but
it
grieves
me
to
say
that
the
young
queen
and
her
ladies
cannot
be
released
until
and
unless
their
innocence
has
been
proved.”

“Innocence?
Why,
you
need
only
look
upon
their
sweet
young
faces
to
see
how
innocent
they
are.”

“A
sweet
face
oft
hides
a
sinner’s
heart.”

Lord
Merryweather
spoke
up
from
the
council
table.
“What
offense
have
these
young
maids
been
accused
of,
and
by
whom?”

The
septa
said,
“Megga
Tyrell
and
Elinor
Tyrell
stand
accused
of
lewdness,
fornication,
and
conspiracy
to
commit
high
treason.
Alla
Tyrell
has
been
charged
with
witnessing
their
shame
and
helping
them
conceal
it.
All
this
Queen
Margaery
has
also
been
accused
of,
as
well
as
adultery
and
high
treason.”

Cersei
put
a
hand
to
her
breast.
“Tell
me
who
is
spreading
such
calumnies
about
my
good-daughter!
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
this.
My
sweet
son
loves
Lady
Margaery
with
all
his
heart,
she
could
never
have
been
so
cruel
as
to
play
him
false.”

“The
accuser
is
a
knight
of
your
own
household.
Ser
Osney
Kettleblack
has
confessed
his
carnal
knowledge
of
the
queen
to
the
High
Septon
himself,
before
the
altar
of
the
Father.”

At
the
council
table
Harys
Swyft
gasped,
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
turned
away.
A
buzz
filled
the
air,
as
if
a
thousand
wasps
were
loose
in
the
throne
room.
Some
of
the
ladies
in
the
galleries
began
to
slip
away,
followed
by
a
stream
of
petty
lords
and
knights
from
the
back
of
the
hall.
The
gold
cloaks
let
them
go,
but
the
queen
had
instructed
Ser
Osfryd
to
make
note
of
all
who
fled.
Suddenly
the
Tyrell
rose
does
not
smell
so
sweet.

“Ser
Osney
is
young
and
lusty,
I
will
grant
you,”
the
queen
said,
“but
a
faithful
knight
for
all
that.
If
he
says
that
he
was
part
of
this...
no,
it
cannot
be.
Margaery
is
a
maiden!”

“She
is
not.
I
examined
her
myself,
at
the
behest
of
His
High
Holiness.
Her
maidenhead
is
not
intact.
Septa
Aglantine
and
Septa
Melicent
will
say
the
same,
as
will
Queen
Margaery’s
own
septa,
Nysterica,
who
has
been
confined
to
a
penitent’s
cell
for
her
part
in
the
queen’s
shame.
Lady
Megga
and
Lady
Elinor
were
examined
as
well.
Both
were
found
to
have
been
broken.”

The
wasps
were
growing
so
loud
that
the
queen
could
hardly
hear
herself
think.
I
do
hope
the
little
queen
and
her
cousins
enjoyed
those
rides
of
theirs.

Lord
Merryweather
thumped
his
fist
on
the
table.
“Lady
Margaery
had
sworn
solemn
oaths
attesting
to
her
maidenhood,
to
Her
Grace
the
queen
and
her
late
father.
Many
here
bore
witness.
Lord
Tyrell
has
also
testified
to
her
innocence,
as
has
the
Lady
Olenna,
whom
we
all
know
to
be
above
reproach.
Would
you
have
us
believe
that
all
of
these
noble
people
lied
to
us?”

“Perhaps
they
were
deceived
as
well,
my
lord,”
said
Septa
Moelle.
“I
cannot
speak
to
this.
I
can
only
swear
to
the
truth
of
what
I
discovered
for
myself
when
I
examined
the
queen.”

The
picture
of
this
sour
old
crone
poking
her
wrinkled
fingers
up
Margaery’s
little
pink
cunt
was
so
droll
that
Cersei
almost
laughed.
“We
insist
that
His
High
Holiness
allow
our
own
maesters
to
examine
my
good-daughter,
to
determine
if
there
is
any
shred
of
truth
to
these
slanders.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
you
shall
accompany
Septa
Moelle
back
to
Beloved
Baelor’s
Sept,
and
return
to
us
with
the
truth
about
our
Margaery’s
maidenhead.”

Pycelle
had
gone
the
color
of
curdled
white.
At
council
meetings
the
wretched
old
fool
cannot
say
enough,
but
now
that
I
need
a
few
words
from
him
he
has
lost
the
power
of
speech,
the
queen
thought,
before
the
old
man
finally
came
out
with,
“There
is
no
need
for
me
to
examine
her...
her
privy
parts.”
His
voice
was
a
quaver.
“I
grieve
to
say...
Queen
Margaery
is
no
maiden.
She
has
required
me
to
make
her
moon
tea,
not
once,
but
many
times.”

The
uproar
that
followed
that
was
all
that
Cersei
Lannister
could
ever
have
hoped
for.

Even
the
royal
herald
beating
on
the
floor
with
his
staff
did
little
to
quell
the
noise.
The
queen
let
it
wash
over
her
for
a
few
heartbeats,
savoring
the
sounds
of
the
little
queen’s
disgrace.
When
it
had
gone
on
long
enough,
she
rose
stone-faced
and
commanded
that
the
gold
cloaks
clear
the
hall.
Margaery
Tyrell
is
done,
she
thought,
exulting.
Her
white
knights
fell
in
around
her
as
she
made
her
exit
through
the
king’s
door
behind
the
Iron
Throne;
Boros
Blount,
Meryn
Trant,
and
Osmund
Kettleblack,
the
last
of
the
Kingsguard
still
remaining
in
the
city.

Moon
Boy
was
standing
beside
the
door,
holding
his
rattle
in
his
hand
and
gaping
at
the
confusion
with
his
big
round
eyes.
A
fool
he
may
be,
but
he
wears
his
folly
honestly.
Maggy
the
Frog
should
have
been
in
motley
too,
for
all
she
knew
about
the
morrow.
Cersei
prayed
the
old
fraud
was
screaming
down
in
hell.
The
younger
queen
whose
coming
she’d
foretold
was
finished,
and
if
that
prophecy
could
fail,
so
could
the
rest.
No
golden
shrouds,
no
valonqar,
I
am
free
of
your
croaking
malice
at
last.

The
remnants
of
her
small
council
followed
her
out.
Harys
Swyft
appeared
dazed.
He
stumbled
at
the
door
and
might
have
fallen
if
Aurane
Waters
had
not
caught
him
by
the
arm.
Even
Orton
Merryweather
seemed
anxious.
“The
smallfolk
are
fond
of
the
little
queen,”
he
said.
“They
will
not
take
well
to
this.
I
fear
what
might
happen
next,
Your
Grace.”

“Lord
Merryweather
is
right,”
said
Lord
Waters.
“If
it
please
Your
Grace,
I
will
launch
the
rest
of
our
new
dromonds.
The
sight
of
them
upon
the
Blackwater
with
King
Tommen’s
banner
flying
from
their
masts
will
remind
the
city
who
rules
here,
and
keep
them
safe
should
the
mobs
decide
to
run
riot
again.”

He
left
the
rest
unspoken;
once
on
the
Blackwater,
his
dromonds
could
stop
Mace
Tyrell
from
bringing
his
army
back
across
the
river,
just
as
Tyrion
had
once
stopped
Stannis.
Highgarden
had
no
sea
power
of
its
own
this
side
of
Westeros.
They
relied
upon
the
Redwyne
fleet,
presently
on
its
way
back
to
the
Arbor.

“A
prudent
measure,”
the
queen
announced.
“Until
this
storm
has
passed,
I
want
your
ships
crewed
and
on
the
water.”

Ser
Harys
Swyft
was
so
pale
and
damp
he
looked
about
to
faint.
“When
word
of
this
reaches
Lord
Tyrell,
his
fury
will
know
no
bounds.
There
will
be
blood
in
the
streets...”

The
knight
of
the
yellow
chicken,
Cersei
mused.
You
ought
to
take
a
worm
for
your
sigil,
ser.
A
chicken
is
too
bold
for
you.
If
Mace
Tyrell
will
not
even
assault
Storm’s
End,
how
do
you
imagine
that
he
would
ever
dare
attack
the
gods?
When
he
was
done
blathering
she
said,
“It
must
not
come
to
blood,
and
I
mean
to
see
that
it
does
not.
I
will
go
to
Baelor’s
Sept
myself
to
speak
to
Queen
Margaery
and
the
High
Septon.
Tommen
loves
them
both,
I
know,
and
would
want
me
to
make
peace
between
them.”

“Peace?”
Ser
Harys
dabbed
at
his
brow
with
a
velvet
sleeve.
“If
peace
is
possible...
that
is
very
brave
of
you.”

“Some
sort
of
trial
may
be
necessary,”
said
the
queen,
“to
disprove
these
base
calumnies
and
lies
and
show
the
world
that
our
sweet
Margaery
is
the
innocent
we
all
know
her
to
be.”

“Aye,”
said
Merryweather,
“but
this
High
Septon
may
want
to
try
the
queen
himself,
as
the
Faith
once
tried
men
of
old.”

I
hope
so,
Cersei
thought.
Such
a
court
was
not
like
to
look
with
favor
on
treasonous
queens
who
spread
their
legs
for
singers
and
profaned
the
Maiden’s
holy
rites
to
hide
their
shame.
“The
important
thing
is
to
find
the
truth,
I
am
sure
we
all
agree,”
she
said.
“And
now,
my
lords,
you
must
excuse
me.
I
must
go
see
the
king.
He
should
not
be
alone
at
such
a
time.”

Tommen
was
fishing
for
cats
when
his
mother
returned
to
him.
Dorcas
had
made
him
a
mouse
with
scraps
of
fur
and
tied
it
on
a
long
string
at
the
end
of
an
old
fishing
pole.
The
kittens
loved
to
chase
it,
and
the
boy
liked
nothing
better
than
jerking
it
about
the
floor
as
they
pounced
after
it.
He
seemed
surprised
when
Cersei
gathered
him
up
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
on
his
brow.
“What’s
that
for,
Mother?
Why
are
you
crying?”

Because
you’re
safe,
she
wanted
to
tell
him.
Because
no
harm
will
ever
come
to
you.
“You
are
mistaken.
A
lion
never
cries.”
There
would
be
time
later
to
tell
him
about
Margaery
and
her
cousins.
“There
are
some
warrants
that
I
need
you
to
sign.”

For
the
king’s
sake,
the
queen
had
left
the
names
off
the
arrest
warrants.
Tommen
signed
them
blank,
and
pressed
his
seal
into
the
warm
wax
happily,
as
he
always
did.
Afterward
she
sent
him
off
with
Jocelyn
Swyft.

Ser
Osfryd
Kettleblack
arrived
as
the
ink
was
drying.
Cersei
had
written
in
the
names
herself:
Ser
Tallad
the
Tall,
Jalabhar
Xho,
Hamish
the
Harper,
Hugh
Clifton,
Mark
Mullendore,
Bayard
Norcross,
Lambert
Turnberry,
Horas
Redwyne,
Hobber
Redwyne,
and
a
certain
churl
named
Wat,
who
called
himself
the
Blue
Bard.

“So
many.”
Ser
Osfryd
shuffled
through
the
warrants,
as
wary
of
the
words
as
if
they
had
been
roaches
crawling
across
the
parchment.
None
of
the
Kettleblacks
could
read.

“Ten.
You
have
six
thousand
gold
cloaks.
Sufficient
for
ten,
I
would
think.
Some
of
the
clever
ones
may
have
fled,
if
the
rumors
reached
their
ears
in
time.
If
so,
it
makes
no
matter,
their
absence
only
makes
them
look
that
much
more
guilty.
Ser
Tallad
is
a
bit
of
an
oaf
and
may
try
to
resist
you.
See
that
he
does
not
die
before
confessing,
and
do
no
harm
to
any
of
the
others.
A
few
may
well
be
innocent.”
It
was
important
that
the
Redwyne
twins
be
found
to
have
been
falsely
accused.
That
would
demonstrate
the
fairness
of
the
judgments
against
the
others.

“We’ll
have
them
all
before
the
sun
comes
up,
Your
Grace.”
Ser
Osfryd
hesitated.
“There’s
a
crowd
gathering
outside
the
door
of
Baelor’s
Sept.”

“What
sort
of
crowd?”
Anything
unexpected
made
her
wary.
She
remembered
what
Lord
Waters
had
said
about
the
riots.
I
had
not
considered
how
the
smallfolk
might
react
to
this.
Margaery
has
been
their
little
pet.
“How
many?”

“A
hundred
or
so.
They’re
shouting
for
the
High
Septon
to
release
the
little
queen.
We
can
send
them
running,
if
you
like.”

“No.
Let
them
shout
until
they’re
hoarse,
it
will
not
sway
the
Sparrow.
He
only
listens
to
the
gods.”
There
was
a
certain
irony
in
His
High
Holiness
having
an
angry
mob
encamped
upon
his
doorstep,
since
just
such
a
mob
had
raised
him
to
the
crystal
crown.
Which
he
promptly
sold.
“The
Faith
has
its
own
knights
now.
Let
them
defend
the
sept.
Oh,
and
close
the
city
gates
as
well.
No
one
is
to
enter
or
leave
King’s
Landing
without
my
leave,
until
all
this
is
done
and
settled.”

“As
you
command,
Your
Grace.”
Ser
Osfryd
bowed
and
went
off
to
find
someone
to
read
the
warrants
to
him.

By
the
time
the
sun
went
down
that
day,
all
of
the
accused
traitors
were
in
custody.
Hamish
the
Harper
had
collapsed
when
they
came
for
him,
and
Ser
Tallad
the
Tall
had
wounded
three
gold
cloaks
before
the
others
overwhelmed
him.
Cersei
ordered
that
the
Redwyne
twins
be
given
comfortable
chambers
in
a
tower.
The
rest
went
down
to
the
dungeons.

“Hamish
is
having
difficulty
breathing,”
Qyburn
informed
her
when
he
came
to
call
that
night.
“He
is
calling
for
a
maester.”

“Tell
him
he
can
have
one
as
soon
as
he
confesses.”
She
thought
a
moment.
“He
is
too
old
to
have
been
amongst
the
lovers,
but
no
doubt
he
was
made
to
play
and
sing
for
Margaery
whilst
she
was
entertaining
other
men.
We
will
need
details.”

“I
shall
help
him
to
remember
them,
Your
Grace.”

The
next
day,
Lady
Merryweather
helped
Cersei
dress
for
their
visit
to
the
little
queen.
“Nothing
too
rich
or
colorful,”
she
said.
“Something
suitably
devout
and
drab
for
the
High
Septon.
He’s
like
to
make
me
pray
with
him.”

In
the
end,
she
chose
a
soft
woolen
dress
that
covered
her
from
throat
to
ankle,
with
only
a
few
small
vines
embroidered
on
the
bodice
and
the
sleeves
in
golden
thread
to
soften
the
severity
of
its
lines.
Even
better,
brown
would
help
conceal
the
dirt
if
she
was
made
to
kneel.
“Whilst
I
am
comforting
my
good-daughter
you
shall
speak
with
the
three
cousins,”
she
told
Taena.
“Win
Alla
if
you
can,
but
be
careful
what
you
say.
The
gods
may
not
be
the
only
ones
listening.”

Jaime
always
said
that
the
hardest
part
of
any
battle
is
just
before,
waiting
for
the
carnage
to
begin.
When
she
stepped
outside,
Cersei
saw
that
the
sky
was
grey
and
bleak.
She
could
not
take
the
risk
of
being
caught
in
a
downpour
and
arriving
at
Baelor’s
Sept
soaked
and
bedraggled.
That
meant
the
litter.
For
her
escort,
she
took
ten
Lannister
house
guards
and
Boros
Blount.
“Margaery’s
mob
may
not
have
the
wit
to
tell
one
Kettleblack
from
another,”
she
told
Ser
Osmund,
“and
I
cannot
have
you
cutting
through
the
commons.
Best
we
keep
you
out
of
sight
for
a
time.”

As
they
made
their
way
across
King’s
Landing,
Taena
had
a
sudden
doubt.
“This
trial,”
she
said,
in
a
quiet
voice,
“what
if
Margaery
demands
that
her
guilt
or
innocence
be
determined
by
wager
of
battle?”

A
smile
brushed
Cersei’s
lips.
“As
queen,
her
honor
must
be
defended
by
a
knight
of
the
Kingsguard.
Why,
every
child
in
Westeros
knows
how
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
championed
his
sister
Queen
Naerys
against
Ser
Morghil’s
accusations.
With
Ser
Loras
so
gravely
wounded,
though,
I
fear
Prince
Aemon’s
part
must
fall
to
one
of
his
Sworn
Brothers.”
She
shrugged.
“Who,
though?
Ser
Arys
and
Ser
Balon
are
far
away
in
Dorne,
Jaime
is
off
at
Riverrun,
and
Ser
Osmund
is
the
brother
of
the
man
accusing
her,
which
leaves
only...
oh,
dear...”

“Boros
Blount
and
Meryn
Trant.”
Lady
Taena
laughed.

“Yes,
and
Ser
Meryn
has
been
feeling
ill
of
late.
Remind
me
to
tell
him
that
when
we
return
to
the
castle.”

“I
shall,
my
sweet.”
Taena
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it.
“I
pray
that
I
never
offend
you.
You
are
terrible
when
roused.”

“Any
mother
would
do
the
same
to
protect
her
children,”
said
Cersei.
“When
do
you
mean
to
bring
that
boy
of
yours
to
court?
Russell,
was
that
his
name?
He
could
train
with
Tommen.”

“That
would
thrill
the
boy,
I
know...
but
things
are
so
uncertain
just
now,
I
thought
it
best
to
wait
until
the
danger
passed.”

“Soon
enough,”
promised
Cersei.
“Send
word
to
Longtable
and
have
Russell
pack
his
best
doublet
and
his
wooden
sword.
A
new
young
friend
will
be
just
the
thing
to
help
Tommen
forget
his
loss,
after
Margaery’s
little
head
has
rolled.”

They
descended
from
the
litter
under
Blessed
Baelor’s
statue.
The
queen
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
bones
and
filth
had
been
cleaned
away.
Ser
Osfryd
had
told
it
true;
the
crowd
was
neither
as
numerous
nor
as
unruly
as
the
sparrows
had
been.
They
stood
about
in
small
clumps,
gazing
sullenly
at
the
doors
of
the
Great
Sept,
where
a
line
of
novice
septons
had
been
drawn
up
with
quarterstaffs
in
their
hands.
No
steel,
Cersei
noted.
That
was
either
very
wise
or
very
stupid,
she
was
not
sure
which.

No
one
made
any
attempt
to
hinder
her.
Smallfolk
and
novices
alike
parted
as
they
passed.
Once
inside
the
doors,
they
were
met
by
three
knights
in
the
Hall
of
Lamps,
each
clad
in
the
rainbow-striped
robes
of
the
Warrior’s
Sons.
“I
am
here
to
see
my
good-daughter,”
Cersei
told
them.

“His
High
Holiness
has
been
expecting
you.
I
am
Ser
Theodan
the
True,
formerly
Ser
Theodan
Wells.
If
Your
Grace
will
come
with
me.”

The
High
Sparrow
was
on
his
knees,
as
ever.
This
time
he
was
praying
before
the
Father’s
altar.
Nor
did
he
break
off
his
prayer
when
the
queen
approached,
but
made
her
wait
impatiently
until
he
had
finished.
Only
then
did
he
rise
and
bow
to
her.
“Your
Grace.
This
is
a
sad
day.”

“Very
sad.
Do
we
have
your
leave
to
speak
with
Margaery
and
her
cousins?”
She
chose
a
meek
and
humble
manner;
with
this
man,
that
was
like
to
work
the
best.

“If
that
is
your
wish.
Come
to
me
afterward,
my
child.
We
must
pray
together,
you
and
I.”

The
little
queen
had
been
confined
atop
one
of
the
Great
Sept’s
slender
towers.
Her
cell
was
eight
feet
long
and
six
feet
wide,
with
no
furnishings
but
a
straw-stuffed
pallet
and
a
bench
for
prayer,
a
ewer
of
water,
a
copy
of
The
Seven-Pointed
Star,
and
a
candle
to
read
it
by.
The
only
window
was
hardly
wider
than
an
arrow
slit.

Cersei
found
Margaery
barefoot
and
shivering,
clad
in
the
roughspun
shift
of
a
novice
sister.
Her
locks
were
all
a
tangle,
and
her
feet
were
filthy.
“They
took
my
clothes
from
me,”
the
little
queen
told
her
once
they
were
alone.
“I
wore
a
gown
of
ivory
lace,
with
freshwater
pearls
on
the
bodice,
but
the
septas
laid
their
hands
on
me
and
stripped
me
to
the
skin.
My
cousins
too.
Megga
sent
one
septa
crashing
into
the
candles
and
set
her
robe
afire.
I
fear
for
Alla,
though.
She
went
as
white
as
milk,
too
frightened
even
to
cry.”

“Poor
child.”
There
were
no
chairs,
so
Cersei
sat
beside
the
little
queen
on
her
pallet.
“Lady
Taena
has
gone
to
speak
with
her,
to
let
her
know
that
she
is
not
forgotten.”

“He
will
not
even
let
me
see
them,”
fumed
Margaery.
“He
keeps
each
of
us
apart
from
the
others.
Until
you
came,
I
was
allowed
no
visitors
but
septas.
One
comes
every
hour
to
ask
if
I
wish
to
confess
my
fornications.
They
will
not
even
let
me
sleep.
They
wake
me
to
demand
confessions.
Last
night
I
confessed
to
Septa
Unella
that
I
wished
to
scratch
her
eyes
out.”

A
shame
you
did
not
do
it,
Cersei
thought.
Blinding
some
poor
old
septa
would
certainly
persuade
the
High
Sparrow
of
your
guilt.
“They
are
questioning
your
cousins
the
same
way.”

“Damn
them,
then,”
said
Margaery.
“Damn
them
all
to
seven
hells.
Alla
is
gentle
and
shy,
how
can
they
do
this
to
her?
And
Megga...
she
laughs
as
loud
as
a
dockside
whore,
I
know,
but
inside
she’s
still
just
a
little
girl.
I
love
them
all,
and
they
love
me.
If
this
sparrow
thinks
to
make
them
lie
about
me...”

“They
stand
accused
as
well,
I
fear.
All
three.”

“My
cousins?”
Margaery
paled.
“Alla
and
Megga
are
hardly
more
than
children.
Your
Grace,
this...
this
is
obscene.
Will
you
take
us
out
of
here?”

“Would
that
I
could.”
Her
voice
was
full
of
sorrow.
“His
High
Holiness
has
his
new
knights
guarding
you.
To
free
you
I
would
need
to
send
the
gold
cloaks
and
profane
this
holy
place
with
killing.”
Cersei
took
Margaery’s
hand
in
hers.
“I
have
not
been
idle,
though.
I
have
gathered
up
all
those
that
Ser
Osney
named
as
your
lovers.
They
will
tell
His
High
Holiness
of
your
innocence,
I
am
certain,
and
swear
to
it
at
your
trial.”

“Trial?”
There
was
real
fear
in
the
girl’s
voice
now.
“Must
there
be
a
trial?”

“How
else
will
you
prove
your
innocence?”
Cersei
gave
Margaery’s
hand
a
reassuring
squeeze.
“It
is
your
right
to
decide
the
manner
of
the
trial,
to
be
sure.
You
are
the
queen.
The
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
are
sworn
to
defend
you.”

Margaery
understood
at
once.
“A
trial
by
battle?
Loras
is
hurt,
though,
elsewise
he...”

“He
has
six
brothers.”

Margaery
stared
at
her,
then
pulled
her
hand
away.
“Is
that
a
jape?
Boros
is
a
craven,
Meryn
is
old
and
slow,
your
brother
is
maimed,
the
other
two
are
off
in
Dorne,
and
Osmund
is
a
bloody
Kettleblack.
Loras
has
two
brothers,
not
six.
If
there’s
to
be
a
trial
by
battle,
I
want
Garlan
as
my
champion.”

“Ser
Garlan
is
not
a
member
of
the
Kingsguard,”
the
queen
said.
“When
the
queen’s
honor
is
at
issue,
law
and
custom
require
that
her
champion
be
one
of
the
king’s
sworn
seven.
The
High
Septon
will
insist,
I
fear.”
I
will
make
certain
of
it.

Margaery
did
not
answer
at
once,
but
her
brown
eyes
narrowed
in
suspicion.
“Blount
or
Trant,”
she
said
at
last.
“It
would
have
to
be
one
of
them.
You’d
like
that,
wouldn’t
you?
Osney
Kettleblack
would
cut
either
one
to
pieces.”

Seven
hells.
Cersei
donned
a
look
of
hurt.
“You
wrong
me,
daughter.
All
I
want—”

“—is
your
son,
all
for
yourself.
He
will
never
have
a
wife
that
you
don’t
hate.
And
I
am
not
your
daughter,
thank
the
gods.
Leave
me.”

“You
are
being
foolish.
I
am
only
here
to
help
you.”

“To
help
me
to
my
grave.
I
asked
for
you
to
leave.
Will
you
make
me
call
my
gaolers
and
have
you
dragged
away,
you
vile,
scheming,
evil
bitch?”

Cersei
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
dignity.
“This
must
be
very
frightening
for
you.
I
shall
forgive
those
words.”
Here,
as
at
court,
one
never
knew
who
might
be
listening.
“I
would
be
afraid
as
well,
in
your
place.
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
has
admitted
providing
you
with
moon
tea,
and
your
Blue
Bard...
if
I
were
you,
my
lady,
I
would
pray
to
the
Crone
for
wisdom
and
to
the
Mother
for
her
mercy.
I
fear
you
may
soon
be
in
dire
need
of
both.”

Four
shriveled
septas
escorted
the
queen
down
the
tower
steps.
Each
of
the
crones
seemed
more
feeble
than
the
last.
When
they
reached
the
ground
they
continued
down,
into
the
heart
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
The
steps
ended
well
below
the
earth,
where
a
line
of
flickering
torches
lit
a
long
hallway.

She
found
the
High
Septon
waiting
for
her
in
a
small
seven-sided
audience
chamber.
The
room
was
sparse
and
plain,
with
bare
stone
walls,
a
rough-hewn
table,
three
chairs,
and
a
prayer
bench.
The
faces
of
the
Seven
had
been
carved
into
the
walls.
Cersei
thought
the
carvings
crude
and
ugly,
but
there
was
a
certain
power
to
them,
especially
about
the
eyes,
orbs
of
onyx,
malachite,
and
yellow
moonstone
that
somehow
made
the
faces
come
alive.

“You
spoke
with
the
queen,”
the
High
Septon
said.

She
resisted
the
urge
to
say,
I
am
the
queen.
“I
did.”

“All
men
sin,
even
kings
and
queens.
I
have
sinned
myself,
and
been
forgiven.
Without
confession,
though,
there
can
be
no
forgiveness.
The
queen
will
not
confess.”

“Perhaps
she
is
innocent.”

“She
is
not.
Holy
septas
have
examined
her,
and
testify
that
her
maidenhead
is
broken.
She
has
drunk
of
moon
tea,
to
murder
the
fruit
of
her
fornications
in
her
womb.
An
anointed
knight
has
sworn
upon
his
sword
to
having
carnal
knowledge
of
her
and
two
of
her
three
cousins.
Others
have
lain
with
her
as
well,
he
says,
and
names
many
names
of
men
both
great
and
humble.”

“My
gold
cloaks
have
taken
all
of
them
to
the
dungeons,”
Cersei
assured
him.
“Only
one
has
yet
been
questioned,
a
singer
called
the
Blue
Bard.
What
he
had
to
say
was
disturbing.
Even
so,
I
pray
that
when
my
good-daughter
is
brought
to
trial,
her
innocence
may
yet
be
proved.”
She
hesitated.
“Tommen
loves
his
little
queen
so
much,
Your
Holiness,
I
fear
it
might
be
hard
for
him
or
his
lords
to
judge
her
justly.
Perhaps
the
Faith
should
conduct
the
trial?”

The
High
Sparrow
steepled
his
thin
hands.
“I
have
had
the
selfsame
thought,
Your
Grace.
Just
as
Maegor
the
Cruel
once
took
the
swords
from
the
Faith,
so
Jaehaerys
the
Conciliator
deprived
us
of
the
scales
of
judgment.
Yet
who
is
truly
fit
to
judge
a
queen,
save
the
Seven
Above
and
the
godsworn
below?
A
sacred
court
of
seven
judges
shall
sit
upon
this
case.
Three
shall
be
of
your
female
sex.
A
maiden,
a
mother,
and
a
crone.
Who
could
be
more
suited
to
judge
the
wickedness
of
women?”

“That
would
be
for
the
best.
To
be
sure,
Margaery
does
have
the
right
to
demand
that
her
guilt
or
innocence
be
proven
by
wager
of
battle.
If
so,
her
champion
must
be
one
of
Tommen’s
Seven.”

“The
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
have
served
as
the
rightful
champions
of
king
and
queen
since
the
days
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror.
Crown
and
Faith
speak
as
one
on
this.”

Cersei
covered
her
face
with
her
hands,
as
if
in
grief.
When
she
raised
her
head
again,
a
tear
glistened
in
one
eye.
“These
are
sad
days
indeed,”
she
said,
“but
I
am
pleased
to
find
us
so
much
in
agreement.
If
Tommen
were
here
I
know
he
would
thank
you.
Together
you
and
I
must
find
the
truth.”

“We
shall.”

“I
must
return
to
the
castle.
With
your
leave,
I
will
take
Ser
Osney
Kettleblack
back
with
me.
The
small
council
will
want
to
question
him,
and
hear
his
accusations
for
themselves.”

“No,”
said
the
High
Septon.

It
was
only
a
word,
one
little
word,
but
to
Cersei
it
felt
like
a
splash
of
icy
water
in
the
face.
She
blinked,
and
her
certainty
flickered,
just
a
little.
“Ser
Osney
will
be
held
securely,
I
promise
you.”

“He
is
held
securely
here.
Come.
I
will
show
you.”

Cersei
could
feel
the
eyes
of
the
Seven
staring
at
her,
eyes
of
jade
and
malachite
and
onyx,
and
a
sudden
shiver
of
fear
went
through
her,
cold
as
ice.
I
am
the
queen,
she
told
herself.
Lord
Tywin’s
daughter.
Reluctantly,
she
followed.

Ser
Osney
was
not
far.
The
chamber
was
dark,
and
closed
by
a
heavy
iron
door.
The
High
Septon
produced
the
key
to
open
it,
and
took
a
torch
down
from
the
wall
to
light
the
room
within.
“After
you,
Your
Grace.”

Within,
Osney
Kettleblack
hung
naked
from
the
ceiling,
swinging
from
a
pair
of
heavy
iron
chains.
He
had
been
whipped.
His
back
and
shoulders
been
laid
almost
bare,
and
cuts
and
welts
crisscrossed
his
legs
and
arse
as
well.

The
queen
could
hardly
stand
to
look
at
him.
She
turned
back
to
the
High
Septon.
“What
have
you
done?”

“We
have
sought
after
the
truth,
most
earnestly.”

“He
told
you
the
truth.
He
came
to
you
of
his
own
free
will
and
confessed
his
sins.”

“Aye.
He
did
that.
I
have
heard
many
men
confess,
Your
Grace,
but
seldom
have
I
heard
a
man
so
pleased
to
be
so
guilty.”

“You
whipped
him!”

“There
can
be
no
penance
without
pain.
No
man
should
spare
himself
the
scourge,
as
I
told
Ser
Osney.
I
seldom
feel
so
close
to
god
as
when
I
am
being
whipped
for
mine
own
wickedness,
though
my
darkest
sins
are
no
wise
near
as
black
as
his.”

“B-but,”
she
sputtered,
“you
preach
the
Mother’s
mercy...”

“Ser
Osney
shall
taste
of
that
sweet
milk
in
the
afterlife.
In
The
Seven-Pointed
Star
it
is
written
that
all
sins
may
be
forgiven,
but
crimes
must
still
be
punished.
Osney
Kettleblack
is
guilty
of
treason
and
murder,
and
the
wages
of
treason
are
death.”

He
is
just
a
priest,
he
cannot
do
this.
“It
is
not
for
the
Faith
to
condemn
a
man
to
death,
whatever
his
offense.”

“Whatever
his
offense.”
The
High
Septon
repeated
the
words
slowly,
weighing
them.
“Strange
to
say,
Your
Grace,
the
more
diligently
we
applied
the
scourge,
the
more
Ser
Osney’s
offenses
seemed
to
change.
He
would
now
have
us
believe
that
he
never
touched
Margaery
Tyrell.
Is
that
not
so,
Ser
Osney?”

Osney
Kettleblack
opened
his
eyes.
When
he
saw
the
queen
standing
there
before
him
he
ran
his
tongue
across
his
swollen
lips,
and
said,
“The
Wall.
You
promised
me
the
Wall.”

“He
is
mad,”
said
Cersei.
“You
have
driven
him
mad.”

“Ser
Osney,”
said
the
High
Septon,
in
a
firm,
clear
voice,
“did
you
have
carnal
knowledge
of
the
queen?”

“Aye.”
The
chains
rattled
softly
as
Osney
twisted
in
his
shackles.
“That
one
there.
She’s
the
queen
I
fucked,
the
one
sent
me
to
kill
the
old
High
Septon.
He
never
had
no
guards.
I
just
come
in
when
he
was
sleeping
and
pushed
a
pillow
down
across
his
face.”

Cersei
whirled,
and
ran.

The
High
Septon
tried
to
seize
her,
but
he
was
some
old
sparrow
and
she
was
a
lioness
of
the
Rock.
She
pushed
him
aside
and
burst
through
the
door,
slamming
it
behind
her
with
a
clang.
The
Kettleblacks,
I
need
the
Kettleblacks,
I
will
send
in
Osfryd
with
the
gold
cloaks
and
Osmund
with
the
Kingsguard,
Osney
will
deny
it
all
once
they
cut
him
free,
and
I’ll
rid
myself
of
this
High
Septon
just
as
I
did
the
other.
The
four
old
septas
blocked
her
way
and
clutched
at
her
with
wrinkled
hands.
She
knocked
one
to
the
floor
and
clawed
another
across
the
face,
and
gained
the
steps.
Halfway
up,
she
remembered
Taena
Merryweather.
It
made
her
stumble,
panting.
Seven
save
me,
she
prayed.
Taena
knows
it
all.
If
they
take
her
too,
and
whip
her...

She
ran
as
far
as
the
sept,
but
no
farther.
There
were
women
waiting
for
her
there,
more
septas
and
silent
sisters
too,
younger
than
the
four
old
crones
below.
“I
am
the
queen,”
she
shouted,
backing
away
from
them.
“I
will
have
your
heads
for
this,
I
will
have
all
your
heads.
Let
me
pass.”
Instead,
they
laid
hands
upon
her.
Cersei
ran
to
the
altar
of
the
Mother,
but
they
caught
her
there,
a
score
of
them,
and
dragged
her
kicking
up
the
tower
steps.
Inside
the
cell
three
silent
sisters
held
her
down
as
a
septa
named
Scolera
stripped
her
bare.
She
even
took
her
smallclothes.
Another
septa
tossed
a
roughspun
shift
at
her.
“You
cannot
do
this,”
the
queen
kept
screaming
at
them.
“I
am
a
Lannister,
unhand
me,
my
brother
will
kill
you,
Jaime
will
slice
you
open
from
throat
to
cunt,
unhand
me!
I
am
the
queen!”

“The
queen
should
pray,”
said
Septa
Scolera,
before
they
left
her
naked
in
the
cold
bleak
cell.

She
was
not
meek
Margaery
Tyrell,
to
don
her
little
shift
and
submit
to
such
captivity.
I
will
teach
them
what
it
means
to
put
a
lion
in
a
cage,
Cersei
thought.
She
tore
the
shift
into
a
hundred
pieces,
found
a
ewer
of
water
and
smashed
it
against
the
wall,
then
did
the
same
with
the
chamber
pot.
When
no
one
came,
she
began
to
pound
on
the
door
with
her
fists.
Her
escort
was
below,
on
the
plaza:
ten
Lannister
guardsmen
and
Ser
Boros
Blount.
Once
they
hear
they’ll
come
free
me,
and
we’ll
drag
the
bloody
High
Sparrow
back
to
the
Red
Keep
in
chains.

She
screamed
and
kicked
and
howled
until
her
throat
was
raw,
at
the
door
and
at
the
window.
No
one
shouted
back,
nor
came
to
rescue
her.
The
cell
began
to
darken.
It
was
growing
cold
as
well.
Cersei
began
to
shiver.
How
can
they
leave
me
like
this,
without
so
much
as
a
fire?
I
am
their
queen.
She
began
to
regret
tearing
apart
the
shift
they’d
given
her.
There
was
a
blanket
on
the
pallet
in
the
corner,
a
threadbare
thing
of
thin
brown
wool.
It
was
rough
and
scratchy,
but
it
was
all
she
had.
Cersei
huddled
underneath
to
keep
from
shivering,
and
before
long
she
had
fallen
into
an
exhausted
sleep.

The
next
she
knew,
a
heavy
hand
was
shaking
her
awake.
It
was
black
as
pitch
inside
the
cell,
and
a
huge
ugly
woman
was
kneeling
over
her,
a
candle
in
her
hand.
“Who
are
you?”
the
queen
demanded.
“Are
you
come
to
set
me
free?”

“I
am
Septa
Unella.
I
am
come
to
hear
you
tell
of
all
your
murders
and
fornications.”

Cersei
knocked
her
hand
aside.
“I
will
have
your
head.
Do
not
presume
to
touch
me.
Get
away.”

The
woman
rose.
“Your
Grace.
I
will
be
back
in
an
hour.
Mayhaps
by
then
you
will
be
ready
to
confess.”

An
hour
and
an
hour
and
an
hour.
So
passed
the
longest
night
that
Cersei
Lannister
had
ever
known,
save
for
the
night
of
Joffrey’s
wedding.
Her
throat
was
so
raw
from
shouting
that
she
could
hardly
swallow.
The
cell
turned
freezing
cold.
She
had
smashed
the
chamber
pot,
so
she
had
to
squat
in
a
corner
to
make
her
water
and
watch
it
trickle
across
the
floor.
Every
time
she
closed
her
eyes,
Unella
was
looming
over
her
again,
shaking
her
and
asking
her
if
she
wanted
to
confess
her
sins.

Day
brought
no
relief.
Septa
Moelle
brought
her
a
bowl
of
some
waterly
grey
gruel
as
the
sun
was
coming
up.
Cersei
flung
it
at
her
head.
When
they
brought
a
fresh
ewer
of
water,
though,
she
was
so
thirsty
that
she
had
no
choice
but
to
drink.
When
they
brought
another
shift,
grey
and
thin
and
smelling
of
mildew,
she
put
it
on
over
her
nakedness.
And
that
evening
when
Moelle
appeared
again
she
ate
the
bread
and
fish
and
demanded
wine
to
wash
it
down.
No
wine
appeared,
only
Septa
Unella,
making
her
hourly
visit
to
ask
if
the
queen
was
ready
to
confess.

What
can
be
happening?
Cersei
wondered,
as
the
thin
slice
of
sky
outside
her
window
began
to
darken
once
again.
Why
has
no
one
come
to
pry
me
out
of
here?
She
could
not
believe
that
the
Kettleblacks
would
abandon
their
brother.
What
was
her
council
doing?
Cravens
and
traitors.
When
I
get
out
of
here
I
will
have
the
lot
of
them
beheaded
and
find
better
men
to
take
their
place.

Thrice
that
day
she
heard
the
sound
of
distant
shouting
drifting
up
from
the
plaza,
but
it
was
Margaery’s
name
that
the
mob
was
calling,
not
hers.

It
was
near
dawn
on
the
second
day
and
Cersei
was
licking
the
last
of
the
porridge
from
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
when
her
cell
door
swung
open
unexpectedly
to
admit
Lord
Qyburn.
It
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
throw
herself
at
him.
“Qyburn,”
she
whispered,
“oh,
gods,
I
am
so
glad
to
see
your
face.
Take
me
home.”

“That
will
not
be
allowed.
You
are
to
be
tried
before
a
holy
court
of
seven,
for
murder,
treason,
and
fornication.”

Cersei
was
so
exhausted
that
the
words
seemed
nonsensical
to
her
at
first.
“Tommen.
Tell
me
of
my
son.
Is
he
still
king?”

“He
is,
Your
Grace.
He
is
safe
and
well,
secure
within
the
walls
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
protected
by
the
Kingsguard.
He
is
lonely,
though.
Fretful.
He
asks
for
you,
and
for
his
little
queen.
As
yet,
no
one
has
told
him
of
your...
your...”

“...difficulties?”
she
suggested.
“What
of
Margaery?”

“She
is
to
be
tried
as
well,
by
the
same
court
that
conducts
your
trial.
I
had
the
Blue
Bard
delivered
to
the
High
Septon,
as
Your
Grace
commanded.
He
is
here
now,
somewhere
down
below
us.
My
whisperers
tell
me
that
they
are
whipping
him,
but
so
far
he
is
still
singing
the
same
sweet
song
we
taught
him.”

The
same
sweet
song.
Her
wits
were
dull
for
want
of
sleep.
Wat,
his
real
name
is
Wat.
If
the
gods
were
good,
Wat
might
die
beneath
the
lash,
leaving
Margaery
with
no
way
to
disprove
his
testimony.
“Where
are
my
knights?
Ser
Osfryd...
the
High
Septon
means
to
kill
his
brother
Osney,
his
gold
cloaks
must...”

“Osfryd
Kettleblack
no
longer
commands
the
City
Watch.
The
king
has
removed
him
from
office
and
raised
the
captain
of
the
Dragon
Gate
in
his
place,
a
certain
Humfrey
Waters.”

Cersei
was
so
tired,
none
of
this
made
any
sense.
“Why
would
Tommen
do
that?”

“The
boy
is
not
to
blame.
When
his
council
puts
a
decree
in
front
of
him,
he
signs
his
name
and
stamps
it
with
his
seal.”

“My
council...
who?
Who
would
do
that?
Not
you?”

“Alas,
I
have
been
dismissed
from
the
council,
although
for
the
nonce
they
allow
me
to
continue
my
work
with
the
eunuch’s
whisperers.
The
realm
is
being
ruled
by
Ser
Harys
Swyft
and
Grand
Maester
Pycelle.
They
have
dispatched
a
raven
to
Casterly
Rock,
inviting
your
uncle
to
return
to
court
and
assume
the
regency.
If
he
means
to
accept,
he
had
best
make
haste.
Mace
Tyrell
has
abandoned
his
siege
of
Storm’s
End
and
is
marching
back
to
the
city
with
his
army,
and
Randyll
Tarly
is
reported
on
his
way
down
from
Maidenpool
as
well.”

“Has
Lord
Merryweather
agreed
to
this?”

“Merryweather
has
resigned
his
seat
on
the
council
and
fled
back
to
Longtable
with
his
wife,
who
was
the
first
to
bring
us
news
of
the...
accusations...
against
Your
Grace.”

“They
let
Taena
go.”
That
was
the
best
thing
she
had
heard
since
the
High
Sparrow
had
said
no.
Taena
could
have
doomed
her.
“What
of
Lord
Waters?
His
ships...
if
he
brings
his
crews
ashore,
he
should
have
enough
men
to...”

“As
soon
as
word
of
Your
Grace’s
present
troubles
reached
the
river,
Lord
Waters
raised
sail,
unshipped
his
oars,
and
took
his
fleet
to
sea.
Ser
Harys
fears
he
means
to
join
Lord
Stannis.
Pycelle
believes
that
he
is
sailing
to
the
Stepstones,
to
set
himself
up
as
a
pirate.”

“All
my
lovely
dromonds.”
Cersei
almost
laughed.
“My
lord
father
used
to
say
that
bastards
are
treacherous
by
nature.
Would
that
I
had
listened.”
She
shivered.
“I
am
lost,
Qyburn.”

“No.”
He
took
her
hand.
“Hope
remains.
Your
Grace
has
the
right
to
prove
your
innocence
by
battle.
My
queen,
your
champion
stands
ready.
There
is
no
man
in
all
the
Seven
Kingdoms
who
can
hope
to
stand
against
him.
If
you
will
only
give
the
command...”

This
time
she
did
laugh.
It
was
funny,
terribly
funny,
hideously
funny.
“The
gods
make
japes
of
all
our
hopes
and
plans.
I
have
a
champion
no
man
can
defeat,
but
I
am
forbidden
to
make
use
of
him.
I
am
the
queen,
Qyburn.
My
honor
can
only
be
defended
by
a
Sworn
Brother
of
the
Kingsguard.”

“I
see.”
The
smile
died
on
Qyburn’s
face.
“Your
Grace,
I
am
at
a
loss.
I
do
not
know
how
to
counsel
you...”

Even
in
her
exhausted,
frightened
state,
the
queen
knew
she
dare
not
trust
her
fate
to
a
court
of
sparrows.
Nor
could
she
count
on
Ser
Kevan
to
intervene,
after
the
words
that
had
passed
between
them
at
their
last
meeting.
It
will
have
to
be
a
trial
by
battle.
There
is
no
other
way.
“Qyburn,
for
the
love
you
bear
me,
I
beg
you,
send
a
message
for
me.
A
raven
if
you
can.
A
rider,
if
not.
You
must
send
to
Riverrun,
to
my
brother.
Tell
him
what
has
happened,
and
write...
write...”

“Yes,
Your
Grace?”

She
licked
her
lips,
shivering.
“Come
at
once.
Help
me.
Save
me.
I
need
you
now
as
I
have
never
needed
you
before.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Come
at
once.”

“As
you
command.
‘I
love
you’
thrice?”

“Thrice.”
She
had
to
reach
him.
“He
will
come.
I
know
he
will.
He
must.
Jaime
is
my
only
hope.”

“My
queen,”
said
Qyburn,
“have
you...
forgotten?
Ser
Jaime
has
no
sword
hand.
If
he
should
champion
you
and
lose...”

We
will
leave
this
world
together,
as
we
once
came
into
it.
“He
will
not
lose.
Not
Jaime.
Not
with
my
life
at
stake.”
=======
slops
through
the
bars.
Strings
of
meat
and
blood
flew
everywhere,
scattering
the
ravens.
They
took
to
the
air,
shrieking
wildly.
The
quicker
birds
snatched
morsels
on
the
wing
and
gulped
them
down
greedily.
Jon
let
the
empty
bucket
clang
to
the
floor.

The
old
man
laid
a
withered,
spotted
hand
on
his
shoulder.
“It
hurts,
boy,”
he
said
softly.
“Oh,
yes.
Choosing…
it
has
always
hurt.
And
always
will.
I
know.”

“You
don’t
know,”
Jon
said
bitterly.
“No
one
knows.
Even
if
I
am
his
bastard,
he’s
still
my
father…”

Maester
Aemon
sighed.
“Have
you
heard
nothing
I’ve
told
you,
Jon?
Do
you
think
you
are
the
first?”
He
shook
his
ancient
head,
a
gesture
weary
beyond
words.
“Three
times
the
gods
saw
fit
to
test
my
vows.
Once
when
I
was
a
boy,
once
in
the
fullness
of
my
manhood,
and
once
when
I
had
grown
old.
By
then
my
strength
was
fled,
my
eyes
grown
dim,
yet
that
last
choice
was
as
cruel
as
the
first.
My
ravens
would
bring
the
news
from
the
south,
words
darker
than
their
wings,
the
ruin
of
my
House,
the
death
of
my
kin,
disgrace
and
desolation.
What
could
I
have
done,
old,
blind,
frail?
I
was
helpless
as
a
suckling
babe,
yet
still
it
grieved
me
to
sit
forgotten
as
they
cut
down
my
brother’s
poor
grandson,
and
his
son,
and
even
the
little
children…”

Jon
was
shocked
to
see
the
shine
of
tears
in
the
old
man’s
eyes.
“Who
are
you?”
he
asked
quietly,
almost
in
dread.

A
toothless
smile
quivered
on
the
ancient
lips.
“Only
a
maester
of
the
Citadel,
bound
in
service
to
Castle
Black
and
the
Night’s
Watch.
In
my
order,
we
put
aside
our
house
names
when
we
take
our
vows
and
don
the
collar.”
The
old
man
touched
the
maester’s
chain
that
hung
loosely
around
his
thin,
fleshless
neck.
“My
father
was
Maekar,
the
First
of
his
Name,
and
my
brother
Aegon
reigned
after
him
in
my
stead.
My
grandfather
named
me
for
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight,
who
was
his
uncle,
or
his
father,
depending
on
which
tale
you
believe.
Aemon,
he
called
me…”

“Aemon…
Targaryen?”
Jon
could
scarcely
believe
it.

“Once,”
the
old
man
said.
“Once.
So
you
see,
Jon,
I
do
know…
and
knowing,
I
will
not
tell
you
stay
or
go.
You
must
make
that
choice
yourself,
and
live
with
it
all
the
rest
of
your
days.
As
I
have.”
His
voice
fell
to
a
whisper.
“As
I
have…”





DAENERYS

When
the
battle
was
done,
Dany
rode
her
silver
through
the
fields
of
the
dead.
Her
handmaids
and
the
men
of
her
khas
came
after,
smiling
and
jesting
among
themselves.

Dothraki
hooves
had
torn
the
earth
and
trampled
the
rye
and
lentils
into
the
ground,
while
arakhs
and
arrows
had
sown
a
terrible
new
crop
and
watered
it
with
blood.
Dying
horses
lifted
their
heads
and
screamed
at
her
as
she
rode
past.
Wounded
men
moaned
and
prayed.
Jaqqa
rhan
moved
among
them,
the
mercy
men
with
their
heavy
axes,
taking
a
harvest
of
heads
from
the
dead
and
dying
alike.
After
them
would
scurry
a
flock
of
small
girls,
pulling
arrows
from
the
corpses
to
fill
their
baskets.
Last
of
all
the
dogs
would
come
sniffing,
lean
and
hungry,
the
feral
pack
that
was
never
far
behind
the
khalasar.

The
sheep
had
been
dead
longest.
There
seemed
to
be
thousands
of
them,
black
with
flies,
arrow
shafts
bristling
from
each
carcass.
Khal
Ogo’s
riders
had
done
that,
Dany
knew;
no
man
of
Drogo’s
khalasar
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
waste
his
arrows
on
sheep
when
there
were
shepherds
yet
to
kill.

The
town
was
afire,
black
plumes
of
smoke
roiling
and
tumbling
as
they
rose
into
a
hard
blue
sky.
Beneath
broken
walls
of
dried
mud,
riders
galloped
back
and
forth,
swinging
their
long
whips
as
they
herded
the
survivors
from
the
smoking
rubble.
The
women
and
children
of
Ogo’s
khalasar
walked
with
a
sullen
pride,
even
in
defeat
and
bondage;
they
were
slaves
now,
but
they
seemed
not
to
fear
it.
It
was
different
with
the
townsfolk.
Dany
pitied
them;
she
remembered
what
terror
felt
like.
Mothers
stumbled
along
with
blank,
dead
faces,
pulling
sobbing
children
by
the
hand.
There
were
only
a
few
men
among
them,
cripples
and
cowards
and
grandfathers.

Ser
Jorah
said
the
people
of
this
country
named
themselves
the
Lhazareen,
but
the
Dothraki
called
them
haesh
rakhi,
the
Lamb
Men.
Once
Dany
might
have
taken
them
for
Dothraki,
for
they
had
the
same
copper
skin
and
almond-shaped
eyes.
Now
they
looked
alien
to
her,
squat
and
flat-faced,
their
black
hair
cropped
unnaturally
short.
They
were
herders
of
sheep
and
eaters
of
vegetables,
and
Khal
Drogo
said
they
belonged
south
of
the
river
bend.
The
grass
of
the
Dothraki
sea
was
not
meant
for
sheep.

Dany
saw
one
boy
bolt
and
run
for
the
river.
A
rider
cut
him
off
and
turned
him,
and
the
others
boxed
him
in,
cracking
their
whips
in
his
face,
running
him
this
way
and
that.
One
galloped
behind
him,
lashing
him
across
the
buttocks
until
his
thighs
ran
red
with
blood.
Another
snared
his
ankle
with
a
lash
and
sent
him
sprawling.
Finally,
when
the
boy
could
only
crawl,
they
grew
bored
of
the
sport
and
put
an
arrow
through
his
back.

Ser
Jorah
met
her
outside
the
shattered
gate.
He
wore
a
dark
green
surcoat
over
his
mail.
His
gauntlets,
greaves,
and
greathelm
were
dark
grey
steel.
The
Dothraki
had
mocked
him
for
a
coward
when
he
donned
his
armor,
but
the
knight
had
spit
insults
right
back
in
their
teeth,
tempers
had
flared,
longsword
had
clashed
with
arakh,
and
the
rider
whose
taunts
had
been
loudest
had
been
left
behind
to
bleed
to
death.

Ser
Jorah
lifted
the
visor
of
his
flat-topped
greathelm
as
he
rode
up.
“Your
lord
husband
awaits
you
within
the
town.”

“Drogo
took
no
harm?”

“A
few
cuts,”
Ser
Jorah
answered,
“nothing
of
consequence.
He
slew
two
khals
this
day.
Khal
Ogo
first,
and
then
the
son,
Fogo,
who
became
khal
when
Ogo
fell.
His
bloodriders
cut
the
bells
from
their
hair,
and
now
Khal
Drogo’s
every
step
rings
louder
than
before.”

Ogo
and
his
son
had
shared
the
high
bench
with
her
lord
husband
at
the
naming
feast
where
Viserys
had
been
crowned,
but
that
was
in
Vaes
Dothrak,
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
where
every
rider
was
a
brother
and
all
quarrels
were
put
aside.
It
was
different
out
in
the
grass.
Ogo’s
khalasar
had
been
attacking
the
town
when
Khal
Drogo
caught
him.
She
wondered
what
the
Lamb
Men
had
thought,
when
they
first
saw
the
dust
of
their
horses
from
atop
those
cracked-mud
walls.
Perhaps
a
few,
the
younger
and
more
foolish
who
still
believed
that
the
gods
heard
the
prayers
of
desperate
men,
took
it
for
deliverance.

Across
the
road,
a
girl
no
older
than
Dany
was
sobbing
in
a
high
thin
voice
as
a
rider
shoved
her
over
a
pile
of
corpses,
facedown,
and
thrust
himself
inside
her.
Other
riders
dismounted
to
take
their
turns.
That
was
the
sort
of
deliverance
the
Dothraki
brought
the
Lamb
Men.

I
am
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
Daenerys
Targaryen
reminded
herself
as
she
turned
her
face
away.
She
pressed
her
lips
together
and
hardened
her
heart
and
rode
on
toward
the
gate.

“Most
of
Ogo’s
riders
fled,”
Ser
Jorah
was
saying.
“Still,
there
may
be
as
many
as
ten
thousand
captives.”

Slaves,
Dany
thought.
Khal
Drogo
would
drive
them
downriver
to
one
of
the
towns
on
Slaver’s
Bay.
She
wanted
to
cry,
but
she
told
herself
that
she
must
be
strong.
This
is
war,
this
is
what
it
looks
like,
this
is
the
price
of
the
Iron
Throne.

“I’ve
told
the
khal
he
ought
to
make
for
Meereen,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“They’ll
pay
a
better
price
than
he’d
get
from
a
slaving
caravan.
Illyrio
writes
that
they
had
a
plague
last
year,
so
the
brothels
are
paying
double
for
healthy
young
girls,
and
triple
for
boys
under
ten.
If
enough
children
survive
the
journey,
the
gold
will
buy
us
all
the
ships
we
need,
and
hire
men
to
sail
them.”

Behind
them,
the
girl
being
raped
made
a
heartrending
sound,
a
long
sobbing
wail
that
went
on
and
on
and
on.
Dany’s
hand
clenched
hard
around
the
reins,
and
she
turned
the
silver’s
head.
“Make
them
stop,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.

“Khaleesi?”
The
knight
sounded
perplexed.

“You
heard
my
words,”
she
said.
“Stop
them.”
She
spoke
to
her
khas
in
the
harsh
accents
of
Dothraki.
“Jhogo,
Quaro,
you
will
aid
Ser
Jorah.
I
want
no
rape.”

The
warriors
exchanged
a
baffled
look.

Jorah
Mormont
spurred
his
horse
closer.
“Princess,”
he
said,
“you
have
a
gentle
heart,
but
you
do
not
understand.
This
is
how
it
has
always
been.
Those
men
have
shed
blood
for
the
khal.
Now
they
claim
their
reward.”

Across
the
road,
the
girl
was
still
crying,
her
high
singsong
tongue
strange
to
Dany’s
ears.
The
first
man
was
done
with
her
now,
and
a
second
had
taken
his
place.

“She
is
a
lamb
girl,”
Quaro
said
in
Dothraki.
“She
is
nothing,
Khaleesi.
The
riders
do
her
honor.
The
Lamb
Men
lay
with
sheep,
it
is
known.”

“It
is
known,”
her
handmaid
Irri
echoed.

“It
is
known,”
agreed
Jhogo,
astride
the
tall
grey
stallion
that
Drogo
had
given
him.
“If
her
wailing
offends
your
ears,
Khaleesi,
Jhogo
will
bring
you
her
tongue.”
He
drew
his
arakh.

“I
will
not
have
her
harmed,”
Dany
said.
“I
claim
her.
Do
as
I
command
you,
or
Khal
Drogo
will
know
the
reason
why.”

“Ai,
Khaleesi,”
Jhogo
replied,
kicking
his
horse.
Quaro
and
the
others
followed
his
lead,
the
bells
in
their
hair
chiming.

“Go
with
them,”
she
commanded
Ser
Jorah.

“As
you
command.”
The
knight
gave
her
a
curious
look.
“You
are
your
brother’s
sister,
in
truth.”

“Viserys?”
She
did
not
understand.

“No,”
he
answered.
“Rhaegar.”
He
galloped
off.

Dany
heard
Jhogo
shout.
The
rapers
laughed
at
him.
One
man
shouted
back.
Jhogo’s
arakh
flashed,
and
the
man’s
head
went
tumbling
from
his
shoulders.
Laughter
turned
to
curses
as
the
horsemen
reached
for
weapons,
but
by
then
Quaro
and
Aggo
and
Rakharo
were
there.
She
saw
Aggo
point
across
the
road
to
where
she
sat
upon
her
silver.
The
riders
looked
at
her
with
cold
black
eyes.
One
spat.
The
others
scattered
to
their
mounts,
muttering.

All
the
while
the
man
atop
the
lamb
girl
continued
to
plunge
in
and
out
of
her,
so
intent
on
his
pleasure
that
he
seemed
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
around
him.
Ser
Jorah
dismounted
and
wrenched
him
off
with
a
mailed
hand.
The
Dothraki
went
sprawling
in
the
mud,
bounced
up
with
a
knife
in
hand,
and
died
with
Aggo’s
arrow
through
his
throat.
Mormont
pulled
the
girl
off
the
pile
of
corpses
and
wrapped
her
in
his
blood-spattered
cloak.
He
led
her
across
the
road
to
Dany.
“What
do
you
want
done
with
her?”

The
girl
was
trembling,
her
eyes
wide
and
vague.
Her
hair
was
matted
with
blood.
“Doreah,
see
to
her
hurts.
You
do
not
have
a
rider’s
look,
perhaps
she
will
not
fear
you.
The
rest,
with
me.”
She
urged
the
silver
through
the
broken
wooden
gate.

It
was
worse
inside
the
town.
Many
of
the
houses
were
afire,
and
the
jaqqa
rhan
had
been
about
their
grisly
work.
Headless
corpses
filled
the
narrow,
twisty
lanes.
They
passed
other
women
being
raped.
Each
time
Dany
reined
up,
sent
her
khas
to
make
an
end
to
it,
and
claimed
the
victim
as
slave.
One
of
them,
a
thick-bodied,
flat-nosed
woman
of
forty
years,
blessed
Dany
haltingly
in
the
Common
Tongue,
but
from
the
others
she
got
only
flat
black
stares.
They
were
suspicious
of
her,
she
realized
with
sadness;
afraid
that
she
had
saved
them
for
some
worse
fate.

“You
cannot
claim
them
all,
child,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
the
fourth
time
they
stopped,
while
the
warriors
of
her
khas
herded
her
new
slaves
behind
her.

“I
am
khaleesi,
heir
to
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
the
blood
of
the
dragon,”
Dany
reminded
him.
“It
is
not
for
you
to
tell
me
what
I
cannot
do.”
Across
the
city,
a
building
collapsed
in
a
great
gout
of
fire
and
smoke,
and
she
heard
distant
screams
and
the
wailing
of
frightened
children.

They
found
Khal
Drogo
seated
before
a
square
windowless
temple
with
thick
mud
walls
and
a
bulbous
dome
like
some
immense
brown
onion.
Beside
him
was
a
pile
of
heads
taller
than
he
was.
One
of
the
short
arrows
of
the
Lamb
Men
stuck
through
the
meat
of
his
upper
arm,
and
blood
covered
the
left
side
of
his
bare
chest
like
a
splash
of
paint.
His
three
bloodriders
were
with
him.

Jhiqui
helped
Dany
dismount;
she
had
grown
clumsy
as
her
belly
grew
larger
and
heavier.
She
knelt
before
the
khal.
“My
sun-and-stars
is
wounded.”
The
arakh
cut
was
wide
but
shallow;
his
left
nipple
was
gone,
and
a
flap
of
bloody
flesh
and
skin
dangled
from
his
chest
like
a
wet
rag.

“Is
scratch,
moon
of
life,
from
arakh
of
one
bloodrider
to
Khal
Ogo,”
Khal
Drogo
said
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“I
kill
him
for
it,
and
Ogo
too.”
He
turned
his
head,
the
bells
in
his
braid
ringing
softly.
“Is
Ogo
you
hear,
and
Fogo
his
khalakka,
who
was
khal
when
I
slew
him.”

“No
man
can
stand
before
the
sun
of
my
life,”
Dany
said,
“the
father
of
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.”

A
mounted
warrior
rode
up
and
vaulted
from
his
saddle.
He
spoke
to
Haggo,
a
stream
of
angry
Dothraki
too
fast
for
Dany
to
understand.
The
huge
bloodrider
gave
her
a
heavy
look
before
he
turned
to
his
khal
“This
one
is
Mago,
who
rides
in
the
khas
of
Ko
Jhaqo.
He
says
the
khaleesi
has
taken
his
spoils,
a
daughter
of
the
lambs
who
was
his
to
mount.”

Khal
Drogo’s
face
was
still
and
hard,
but
his
black
eyes
were
curious
as
they
went
to
Dany.
“Tell
me
the
truth
of
this,
moon
of
my
life,”
he
commanded
in
Dothraki.

Dany
told
him
what
she
had
done,
in
his
own
tongue
so
the
khal
would
understand
her
better,
her
words
simple
and
direct.

When
she
was
done,
Drogo
was
frowning.
“This
is
the
way
of
war.
These
women
are
our
slaves
now,
to
do
with
as
we
please.”

“It
pleases
me
to
hold
them
safe,”
Dany
said,
wondering
if
she
had
dared
too
much.
“If
your
warriors
would
mount
these
women,
let
them
take
them
gently
and
keep
them
for
wives.
Give
them
places
in
the
khalasar
and
let
them
bear
you
sons.”

Qotho
was
ever
the
cruelest
of
the
bloodriders.
It
was
he
who
laughed.
“Does
the
horse
breed
with
the
sheep?”

Something
in
his
tone
reminded
her
of
Viserys.
Dany
turned
on
him
angrily.
“The
dragon
feeds
on
horse
and
sheep
alike.”

Khal
Drogo
smiled.
“See
how
fierce
she
grows!”
he
said.
“It
is
my
son
inside
her,
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world,
filling
her
with
his
fire.
Ride
slowly,
Qotho…
if
the
mother
does
not
burn
you
where
you
sit,
the
son
will
trample
you
into
the
mud.
And
you,
Mago,
hold
your
tongue
and
find
another
lamb
to
mount.
These
belong
to
my
khaleesi.”
He
started
to
reach
out
a
hand
to
Daenerys,
but
as
he
lifted
his
arm
Drogo
grimaced
in
sudden
pain
and
turned
his
head.

Dany
could
almost
feel
his
agony.
The
wounds
were
worse
than
Ser
Jorah
had
led
her
to
believe.
“Where
are
the
healers?”
she
demanded.
The
khalasar
had
two
sorts:
barren
women
and
eunuch
slaves.
The
herbwomen
dealt
in
potions
and
spells,
the
eunuchs
in
knife,
needle,
and
fire.
“Why
do
they
not
attend
the
khal?”

“The
khal
sent
the
hairless
men
away,
Khaleesi,”
old
Cohollo
assured
her.
Dany
saw
the
bloodrider
had
taken
a
wound
himself;
a
deep
gash
in
his
left
shoulder.

“Many
riders
are
hurt,”
Khal
Drogo
said
stubbornly.
“Let
them
be
healed
first.
This
arrow
is
no
more
than
the
bite
of
a
fly,
this
little
cut
only
a
new
scar
to
boast
of
to
my
son.”

Dany
could
see
the
muscles
in
his
chest
where
the
skin
had
been
cut
away.
A
trickle
of
blood
ran
from
the
arrow
that
pierced
his
arm.
“It
is
not
for
Khal
Drogo
to
wait,”
she
proclaimed.
“Jhogo,
seek
out
these
eunuchs
and
bring
them
here
at
once.”

“Silver
Lady,”
a
woman’s
voice
said
behind
her,
“I
can
help
the
Great
Rider
with
his
hurts.”

Dany
turned
her
head.
The
speaker
was
one
of
the
slaves
she
had
claimed,
the
heavy,
flat-nosed
woman
who
had
blessed
her.

“The
khal
needs
no
help
from
women
who
lie
with
sheep,”
barked
Qotho.
“Aggo,
cut
out
her
tongue.”

Aggo
grabbed
her
hair
and
pressed
a
knife
to
her
throat.

Dany
lifted
a
hand.
“No.
She
is
mine.
Let
her
speak.”

Aggo
looked
from
her
to
Qotho.
He
lowered
his
knife.

“I
meant
no
wrong,
fierce
riders.”
The
woman
spoke
Dothraki
well.
The
robes
she
wore
had
once
been
the
lightest
and
finest
of
woolens,
rich
with
embroidery,
but
now
they
were
mud-caked
and
bloody
and
ripped.
She
clutched
the
torn
cloth
of
her
bodice
to
her
heavy
breasts.
“I
have
some
small
skill
in
the
healing
arts.”

“Who
are
you?”
Dany
asked
her.

“I
am
named
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
I
am
godswife
of
this
temple.”

“Maegi,”
grunted
Haggo,
fingering
his
arakh.
His
look
was
dark.
Dany
remembered
the
word
from
a
terrifying
story
that
Jhiqui
had
told
her
one
night
by
the
cookfire.
A
maegi
was
a
woman
who
lay
with
demons
and
practiced
the
blackest
of
sorceries,
a
vile
thing,
evil
and
soulless,
who
came
to
men
in
the
dark
of
night
and
sucked
life
and
strength
from
their
bodies.

“I
am
a
healer,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said.

“A
healer
of
sheeps,”
sneered
Qotho.
“Blood
of
my
blood,
I
say
kill
this
maegi
and
wait
for
the
hairless
men.”

Dany
ignored
the
bloodrider’s
outburst.
This
old,
homely,
thickbodied
woman
did
not
look
like
a
maegi
to
her.
“Where
did
you
learn
your
healing,
Mirri
Maz
Duur?”

“My
mother
was
godswife
before
me,
and
taught
me
all
the
songs
and
spells
most
pleasing
to
the
Great
Shepherd,
and
how
to
make
the
sacred
smokes
and
ointments
from
leaf
and
root
and
berry.
When
I
was
younger
and
more
fair,
I
went
in
caravan
to
Asshai
by
the
Shadow,
to
learn
from
their
mages.
Ships
from
many
lands
come
to
Asshai,
so
I
lingered
long
to
study
the
healing
ways
of
distant
peoples.
A
moonsinger
of
the
Jogos
Nhai
gifted
me
with
her
birthing
songs,
a
woman
of
your
own
riding
people
taught
me
the
magics
of
grass
and
corn
and
horse,
and
a
maester
from
the
Sunset
Lands
opened
a
body
for
me
and
showed
me
all
the
secrets
that
hide
beneath
the
skin.”

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
spoke
up.
“A
maester?”

“Marwyn,
he
named
himself,”
the
woman
replied
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“From
the
sea.
Beyond
the
sea.
The
Seven
Lands,
he
said.
Sunset
Lands.
Where
men
are
iron
and
dragons
rule.
He
taught
me
this
speech.”

“A
maester
in
Asshai,”
Ser
Jorah
mused.
“Tell
me,
Godswife,
what
did
this
Marwyn
wear
about
his
neck?”

“A
chain
so
tight
it
was
like
to
choke
him,
Iron
Lord,
with
links
of
many
metals.”

The
knight
looked
at
Dany.
“Only
a
man
trained
in
the
Citadel
of
Oldtown
wears
such
a
chain,”
he
said,
“and
such
men
do
know
much
of
healing.”

“Why
should
you
want
to
help
my
khal?”

“All
men
are
one
flock,
or
so
we
are
taught,”
replied
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“The
Great
Shepherd
sent
me
to
earth
to
heal
his
lambs,
wherever
I
might
find
them.”

Qotho
gave
her
a
stinging
slap.
“We
are
no
sheep,
maegi.”

“Stop
it,”
Dany
said
angrily.
“She
is
mine.
I
will
not
have
her
harmed.”

Khal
Drogo
grunted.
“The
arrow
must
come
out,
Qotho.”

“Yes,
Great
Rider,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
answered,
touching
her
bruised
face.
“And
your
breast
must
be
washed
and
sewn,
lest
the
wound
fester.”

“Do
it,
then,”
Khal
Drogo
commanded.

“Great
Rider,”
the
woman
said,
“my
tools
and
potions
are
inside
the
god’s
house,
where
the
healing
powers
are
strongest.”

“I
will
carry
you,
blood
of
my
blood,”
Haggo
offered.

Khal
Drogo
waved
him
away.
“I
need
no
man’s
help,”
he
said,
in
a
voice
proud
and
hard.
He
stood,
unaided,
towering
over
them
all.
A
fresh
wave
of
blood
ran
down
his
breast,
from
where
Ogo’s
arakh
had
cut
off
his
nipple.
Dany
moved
quickly
to
his
side.
“I
am
no
man,”
she
whispered,
“so
you
may
lean
on
me.”
Drogo
put
a
huge
hand
on
her
shoulder.
She
took
some
of
his
weight
as
they
walked
toward
the
great
mud
temple.
The
three
bloodriders
followed.
Dany
commanded
Ser
Jorah
and
the
warriors
of
her
khas
to
guard
the
entrance
and
make
certain
no
one
set
the
building
afire
while
they
were
still
inside.

They
passed
through
a
series
of
anterooms,
into
the
high
central
chamber
under
the
onion.
Faint
light
shone
down
through
hidden
windows
above.
A
few
torches
burnt
smokily
from
sconces
on
the
walls.
Sheepskins
were
scattered
across
the
mud
floor.
“There,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said,
pointing
to
the
altar,
a
massive
blue-veined
stone
carved
with
images
of
shepherds
and
their
flocks.
Khal
Drogo
lay
upon
it.
The
old
woman
threw
a
handful
of
dried
leaves
onto
a
brazier,
filling
the
chamber
with
fragrant
smoke.
“Best
if
you
wait
outside,”
she
told
the
rest
of
them.

“We
are
blood
of
his
blood,”
Cohollo
said.
“Here
we
wait.”

Qotho
stepped
close
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“Know
this,
wife
of
the
Lamb
God.
Harm
the
khal
and
you
suffer
the
same.”
He
drew
his
skinning
knife
and
showed
her
the
blade.

“She
will
do
no
harm.”
Dany
felt
she
could
trust
this
old,
plainfaced
woman
with
her
flat
nose;
she
had
saved
her
from
the
hard
hands
of
her
rapers,
after
all.

“If
you
must
stay,
then
help,”
Mirri
told
the
bloodriders.
“The
Great
Rider
is
too
strong
for
me.
Hold
him
still
while
I
draw
the
arrow
from
his
flesh.”
She
let
the
rags
of
her
gown
fall
to
her
waist
as
she
opened
a
carved
chest,
and
busied
herself
with
bottles
and
boxes,
knives
and
needles.
When
she
was
ready,
she
broke
off
the
barbed
arrowhead
and
pulled
out
the
shaft,
chanting
in
the
singsong
tongue
of
the
Lhazareen.
She
heated
a
flagon
of
wine
to
boiling
on
the
brazier,
and
poured
it
over
his
wounds.
Khal
Drogo
cursed
her,
but
he
did
not
move.
She
bound
the
arrow
wound
with
a
plaster
of
wet
leaves
and
turned
to
the
gash
on
his
breast,
smearing
it
with
a
pale
green
paste
before
she
pulled
the
flap
of
skin
back
in
place.
The
khal
ground
his
teeth
together
and
swallowed
a
scream.
The
godswife
took
out
a
silver
needle
and
a
bobbin
of
silk
thread
and
began
to
close
the
flesh.
When
she
was
done
she
painted
the
skin
with
red
ointment,
covered
it
with
more
leaves,
and
bound
the
breast
in
a
ragged
piece
of
lambskin.
“You
must
say
the
prayers
I
give
you
and
keep
the
lambskin
in
place
for
ten
days
and
ten
nights,”
she
said.
“There
will
be
fever,
and
itching,
and
a
great
scar
when
the
healing
is
done.”

Khal
Drogo
sat,
bells
ringing.
“I
sing
of
my
scars,
sheep
woman.”
He
flexed
his
arm
and
scowled.

“Drink
neither
wine
nor
the
milk
of
the
poppy,”
she
cautioned
him.
“Pain
you
will
have,
but
you
must
keep
your
body
strong
to
fight
the
poison
spirits.”

“I
am
khal,”
Drogo
said.
“I
spit
on
pain
and
drink
what
I
like.
Cohollo,
bring
my
vest.”
The
older
man
hastened
off.

“Before,”
Dany
said
to
the
ugly
Lhazareen
woman,
“I
heard
you
speak
of
birthing
songs…”

“I
know
every
secret
of
the
bloody
bed,
Silver
Lady,
nor
have
I
ever
lost
a
babe,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
replied.

“My
time
is
near,”
Dany
said.
“I
would
have
you
attend
me
when
he
comes,
if
you
would.”

Khal
Drogo
laughed.
“Moon
of
my
life,
you
do
not
ask
a
slave,
you
tell
her.
She
will
do
as
you
command.”
He
jumped
down
from
the
altar.
“Come,
my
blood.
The
stallions
call,
this
place
is
ashes.
It
is
time
to
ride.”

Haggo
followed
the
khal
from
the
temple,
but
Qotho
lingered
long
enough
to
favor
Mirri
Maz
Duur
with
a
stare.
“Remember,
maegi,
as
the
khal
fares,
so
shall
you.”

“As
you
say,
rider,”
the
woman
answered
him,
gathering
up
her
jars
and
bottles.
“The
Great
Shepherd
guards
the
flock.”





TYRION

On
a
hill
overlooking
the
kingsroad,
a
long
trestle
table
of
rough-hewn
pine
had
been
erected
beneath
an
elm
tree
and
covered
with
a
golden
cloth.
There,
beside
his
pavilion,
Lord
Tywin
took
his
evening
meal
with
his
chief
knights
and
lords
bannermen,
his
great
crimson-and-gold
standard
waving
overhead
from
a
lofty
pike.

Tyrion
arrived
late,
saddlesore,
and
sour,
all
too
vividly
aware
of
how
amusing
he
must
look
as
he
waddled
up
the
slope
to
his
father.
The
day’s
march
had
been
long
and
tiring.
He
thought
he
might
get
quite
drunk
tonight.
It
was
twilight,
and
the
air
was
alive
with
drifting
fireflies.

The
cooks
were
serving
the
meat
course:
five
suckling
pigs,
skin
seared
and
crackling,
a
different
fruit
in
every
mouth.
The
smell
made
his
mouth
water.
“My
pardons,”
he
began,
taking
his
place
on
the
bench
beside
his
uncle.

“Perhaps
I’d
best
charge
you
with
burying
our
dead,
Tyrion,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“If
you
are
as
late
to
battle
as
you
are
to
table,
the
fighting
will
all
be
done
by
the
time
you
arrive.”

“Oh,
surely
you
can
save
me
a
peasant
or
two,
Father,”
Tyrion
replied.
“Not
too
many,
I
wouldn’t
want
to
be
greedy.”
He
filled
his
wine
cup
and
watched
a
serving
man
carve
into
the
pig.
The
crisp
skin
crackled
under
his
knife,
and
hot
juice
ran
from
the
meat.
It
was
the
loveliest
sight
Tyrion
had
seen
in
ages.

“Ser
Addam’s
outriders
say
the
Stark
host
has
moved
south
from
the
Twins,”
his
father
reported
as
his
trencher
was
filled
with
slices
of
pork.
“Lord
Frey’s
levies
have
joined
them.
They
are
likely
no
more
than
a
day’s
march
north
of
us.”

“Please,
Father,”
Tyrion
said.
“I’m
about
to
eat.”

“Does
the
thought
of
facing
the
Stark
boy
unman
you,
Tyrion?
Your
brother
Jaime
would
be
eager
to
come
to
grips
with
him.”

“I’d
sooner
come
to
grips
with
that
pig.
Robb
Stark
is
not
half
so
tender,
and
he
never
smelled
as
good.”

Lord
Lefford,
the
sour
bird
who
had
charge
of
their
stores
and
supplies,
leaned
forward.
“I
hope
your
savages
do
not
share
your
reluctance,
else
we’ve
wasted
our
good
steel
on
them.”

“My
savages
will
put
your
steel
to
excellent
use,
my
lord,”
Tyrion
replied.
When
he
had
told
Lefford
he
needed
arms
and
armor
to
equip
the
three
hundred
men
Ulf
had
fetched
down
out
of
the
foothills,
you
would
have
thought
he’d
asked
the
man
to
turn
his
virgin
daughters
over
to
their
pleasure.

Lord
Lefford
frowned.
“I
saw
that
great
hairy
one
today,
the
one
who
insisted
that
he
must
have
two
battle-axes,
the
heavy
black
steel
ones
with
twin
crescent
blades.”

“Shagga
likes
to
kill
with
either
hand,”
Tyrion
said
as
a
trencher
of
steaming
pork
was
laid
in
front
of
him.

“He
still
had
that
wood-axe
of
his
strapped
to
his
back.”

“Shagga
is
of
the
opinion
that
three
axes
are
even
better
than
two.”
Tyrion
reached
a
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
salt
dish,
and
sprinkled
a
healthy
pinch
over
his
meat.

Ser
Kevan
leaned
forward.
“We
had
a
thought
to
put
you
and
your
wildlings
in
the
vanguard
when
we
come
to
battle.”

Ser
Kevan
seldom
“had
a
thought”
that
Lord
Tywin
had
not
had
first.
Tyrion
had
skewered
a
chunk
of
meat
on
the
point
of
his
dagger
and
brought
it
to
his
mouth.
Now
he
lowered
it.
“The
vanguard?”
he
repeated
dubiously.
Either
his
lord
father
had
a
new
respect
for
Tyrion’s
abilities,
or
he’d
decided
to
rid
himself
of
his
embarrassing
get
for
good.
Tyrion
had
the
gloomy
feeling
he
knew
which.

“They
seem
ferocious
enough,”
Ser
Kevan
said.

“Ferocious?”
Tyrion
realized
he
was
echoing
his
uncle
like
a
trained
bird.
His
father
watched,
judging
him,
weighing
every
word.
“Let
me
tell
you
how
ferocious
they
are.
Last
night,
a
Moon
Brother
stabbed
a
Stone
Crow
over
a
sausage.
So
today
as
we
made
camp
three
Stone
Crows
seized
the
man
and
opened
his
throat
for
him.
Perhaps
they
were
hoping
to
get
the
sausage
back,
I
couldn’t
say.
Bronn
managed
to
keep
Shagga
from
chopping
off
the
dead
man’s
cock,
which
was
fortunate,
but
even
so
Ulf
is
demanding
blood
money,
which
Conn
and
Shagga
refuse
to
pay.”

“When
soldiers
lack
discipline,
the
fault
lies
with
their
lord
commander,”
his
father
said.

His
brother
Jaime
had
always
been
able
to
make
men
follow
him
eagerly,
and
die
for
him
if
need
be.
Tyrion
lacked
that
gift.
He
bought
loyalty
with
gold,
and
compelled
obedience
with
his
name.
“A
bigger
man
would
be
able
to
put
the
fear
in
them,
is
that
what
you’re
saying,
my
lord?”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
turned
to
his
brother.
“If
my
son’s
men
will
not
obey
his
commands,
perhaps
the
vanguard
is
not
the
place
for
him.
No
doubt
he
would
be
more
comfortable
in
the
rear,
guarding
our
baggage
train.”

“Do
me
no
kindnesses,
Father,”
he
said
angrily.
“If
you
have
no
other
command
to
offer
me,
I’ll
lead
your
van.”

Lord
Tywin
studied
his
dwarf
son.
“I
said
nothing
about
command.
You
will
serve
under
Ser
Gregor.”

Tyrion
took
one
bite
of
pork,
chewed
a
moment,
and
spit
it
out
angrily.
“I
find
I
am
not
hungry
after
all,”
he
said,
climbing
awkwardly
off
the
bench.
“Pray
excuse
me,
my
lords.”

Lord
Tywin
inclined
his
head,
dismissing
him.
Tyrion
turned
and
walked
away.
He
was
conscious
of
their
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
waddled
down
the
hill.
A
great
gust
of
laughter
went
up
from
behind
him,
but
he
did
not
look
back.
He
hoped
they
all
choked
on
their
suckling
pigs.

Dusk
had
settled,
turning
all
the
banners
black.
The
Lannister
camp
sprawled
for
miles
between
the
river
and
the
kingsroad.
In
amongst
the
men
and
the
horses
and
the
trees,
it
was
easy
to
get
lost,
and
Tyrion
did.
He
passed
a
dozen
great
pavilions
and
a
hundred
cookfires.
Fireflies
drifted
amongst
the
tents
like
wandering
stars.
He
caught
the
scent
of
garlic
sausage,
spiced
and
savory,
so
tempting
it
made
his
empty
stomach
growl.
Away
in
the
distance,
he
heard
voices
raised
in
some
bawdy
song.
A
giggling
woman
raced
past
him,
naked
beneath
a
dark
cloak,
her
drunken
pursuer
stumbling
over
tree
roots.
Farther
on,
two
spearmen
faced
each
other
across
a
little
trickle
of
a
stream,
practicing
their
thrust-and-parry
in
the
fading
light,
their
chests
bare
and
slick
with
sweat.

No
one
looked
at
him.
No
one
spoke
to
him.
No
one
paid
him
any
mind.
He
was
surrounded
by
men
sworn
to
House
Lannister,
a
vast
host
twenty
thousand
strong,
and
yet
he
was
alone.

When
he
heard
the
deep
rumble
of
Shagga’s
laughter
booming
through
the
dark,
he
followed
it
to
the
Stone
Crows
in
their
small
corner
of
the
night.
Conn
son
of
Coratt
waved
a
tankard
of
ale.
“Tyrion
Halfman!
Come,
sit
by
our
fire,
share
meat
with
the
Stone
Crows.
We
have
an
ox.”

“I
can
see
that,
Conn
son
of
Coratt.”
The
huge
red
carcass
was
suspended
over
a
roaring
fire,
skewered
on
a
spit
the
size
of
a
small
tree.
No
doubt
it
was
a
small
tree.
Blood
and
grease
dripped
down
into
the
flames
as
two
Stone
Crows
turned
the
meat.
“I
thank
you.
Send
for
me
when
the
ox
is
cooked.”
From
the
look
of
it,
that
might
even
be
before
the
battle.
He
walked
on.

Each
clan
had
its
own
cookfire;
Black
Ears
did
not
eat
with
Stone
Crows,
Stone
Crows
did
not
eat
with
Moon
Brothers,
and
no
one
ate
with
Burned
Men.
The
modest
tent
he
had
coaxed
out
of
Lord
Lefford’s
stores
had
been
erected
in
the
center
of
the
four
fires.
Tyrion
found
Bronn
sharing
a
skin
of
wine
with
the
new
servants.
Lord
Tywin
had
sent
him
a
groom
and
a
body
servant
to
see
to
his
needs,
and
even
insisted
he
take
a
squire.
They
were
seated
around
the
embers
of
a
small
cookfire.
A
girl
was
with
them;
slim,
dark-haired,
no
more
than
eighteen
by
the
look
of
her.
Tyrion
studied
her
face
for
a
moment,
before
he
spied
fishbones
in
the
ashes.
“What
did
you
eat?”

“Trout,
m’lord,”
said
his
groom.
“Bronn
caught
them.”

Trout,
he
thought.
Suckling
pig.
Damn
my
father.
He
stared
mournfully
at
the
bones,
his
belly
rumbling.

His
squire,
a
boy
with
the
unfortunate
name
of
Podrick
Payne,
swallowed
whatever
he
had
been
about
to
say.
The
lad
was
a
distant
cousin
to
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
the
king’s
headsman…
and
almost
as
quiet,
although
not
for
want
of
a
tongue.
Tyrion
had
made
him
stick
it
out
once,
just
to
be
certain.
“Definitely
a
tongue,”
he
had
said.
“Someday
you
must
learn
to
use
it.”

At
the
moment,
he
did
not
have
the
patience
to
try
and
coax
a
thought
out
of
the
lad,
whom
he
suspected
had
been
inflicted
on
him
as
a
cruel
jape.
Tyrion
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
girl.
“Is
this
her?”
he
asked
Bronn.

She
rose
gracefully
and
looked
down
at
him
from
the
lofty
height
of
five
feet
or
more.
“It
is,
m’lord,
and
she
can
speak
for
herself,
if
it
please
you.”

He
cocked
his
head
to
one
side.
“I
am
Tyrion,
of
House
Lannister.
Men
call
me
the
Imp.”

“My
mother
named
me
Shae.
Men
call
me…
often.”

Bronn
laughed,
and
Tyrion
had
to
smile.
“Into
the
tent,
Shae,
if
you
would
be
so
kind.”
He
lifted
the
flap
and
held
it
for
her.
Inside,
he
knelt
to
light
a
candle.

The
life
of
a
soldier
was
not
without
certain
compensations.
Wherever
you
have
a
camp,
you
are
certain
to
have
camp
followers.
At
the
end
of
the
day’s
march,
Tyrion
had
sent
Bronn
back
to
find
him
a
likely
whore.
“I
would
prefer
one
who
is
reasonably
young,
with
as
pretty
a
face
as
you
can
find,”
he
had
said.
“If
she
has
washed
sometime
this
year,
I
shall
be
glad.
If
she
hasn’t,
wash
her.
Be
certain
that
you
tell
her
who
I
am,
and
warn
her
of
what
I
am.”
Jyck
had
not
always
troubled
to
do
that.
There
was
a
look
the
girls
got
in
their
eyes
sometimes
when
they
first
beheld
the
lordling
they’d
been
hired
to
pleasure…
a
took
that
Tyrion
Lannister
did
not
ever
care
to
see
again.

He
lifted
the
candle
and
looked
her
over.
Bronn
had
done
well
enough;
she
was
doe-eyed
and
slim,
with
small
firm
breasts
and
a
smile
that
was
by
turns
shy,
insolent,
and
wicked.
He
liked
that.
“Shall
I
take
my
gown
off,
m’lord?”
she
asked.

“In
good
time.
Are
you
a
maiden,
Shae?”

“If
it
please
you,
m’lord,”
she
said
demurely.

“What
would
please
me
would
be
the
truth
of
you,
girl.”

“Aye,
but
that
will
cost
you
double.”

Tyrion
decided
they
would
get
along
splendidly.
“I
am
a
Lannister.
Gold
I
have
in
plenty,
and
you’ll
find
me
generous…
but
I’ll
want
more
from
you
than
what
you’ve
got
between
your
legs,
though
I’ll
want
that
too.
You’ll
share
my
tent,
pour
my
wine,
laugh
at
my
jests,
rub
the
ache
from
my
legs
after
each
day’s
ride…
and
whether
I
keep
you
a
day
or
a
year,
for
so
long
as
we
are
together
you
will
take
no
other
men
into
your
bed.”

“Fair
enough.”
She
reached
down
to
the
hem
of
her
thin
roughspun
gown
and
pulled
it
up
over
her
head
in
one
smooth
motion,
tossing
it
aside.
There
was
nothing
underneath
but
Shae.
“If
he
don’t
put
down
that
candle,
m’lord
will
burn
his
fingers.”

Tyrion
put
down
the
candle,
took
her
hand
in
his,
and
pulled
her
gently
to
him.
She
bent
to
kiss
him.
Her
mouth
tasted
of
honey
and
cloves,
and
her
fingers
were
deft
and
practiced
as
they
found
the
fastenings
of
his
clothes.

When
he
entered
her,
she
welcomed
him
with
whispered
endearments
and
small,
shuddering
gasps
of
pleasure.
Tyrion
suspected
her
delight
was
feigned,
but
she
did
it
so
well
that
it
did
not
matter.
That
much
truth
he
did
not
crave.

He
had
needed
her,
Tyrion
realized
afterward,
as
she
lay
quietly
in
his
arms.
Her
or
someone
like
her.
It
had
been
nigh
on
a
year
since
he’d
lain
with
a
woman,
since
before
he
had
set
out
for
Winterfell
in
company
with
his
brother
and
King
Robert.
He
could
well
die
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after,
and
if
he
did,
he
would
sooner
go
to
his
grave
thinking
of
Shae
than
of
his
lord
father,
Lysa
Arryn,
or
the
Lady
Catelyn
Stark.

He
could
feel
the
softness
of
her
breasts
pressed
against
his
arm
as
she
lay
beside
him.
That
was
a
good
feeling.
A
song
filled
his
head.
Softly,
quietly,
he
began
to
whistle.

“What’s
that,
m’lord?”
Shae
murmured
against
him.

“Nothing,”
he
told
her.
“A
song
I
learned
as
a
boy,
that’s
all.
Go
to
sleep,
sweetling.”

When
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
breathing
deep
and
steady,
Tyrion
slid
out
from
beneath
her,
gently,
so
as
not
to
disturb
her
sleep.
Naked,
he
crawled
outside,
stepped
over
his
squire,
and
walked
around
behind
his
tent
to
make
water.

Bronn
was
seated
cross-legged
under
a
chestnut
tree,
near
where
they’d
tied
the
horses.
He
was
honing
the
edge
of
his
sword,
wide
awake;
the
sellsword
did
not
seem
to
sleep
like
other
men.
“Where
did
you
find
her?”
Tyrion
asked
him
as
he
pissed.

“I
took
her
from
a
knight.
The
man
was
loath
to
give
her
up,
but
your
name
changed
his
thinking
somewhat…
that,
and
my
dirk
at
his
throat.”

“Splendid,”
Tyrion
said
dryly,
shaking
off
the
last
drops.
“I
seem
to
recall
saying
find
me
a
whore,
not
make
me
an
enemy.”

“The
pretty
ones
were
all
claimed,”
Bronn
said.
“I’ll
be
pleased
to
take
her
back
if
you’d
prefer
a
toothless
drab.”

Tyrion
limped
closer
to
where
he
sat.
“My
lord
father
would
call
that
insolence,
and
send
you
to
the
mines
for
impertinence.”

“Good
for
me
you’re
not
your
father,”
Bronn
replied.
“I
saw
one
with
boils
all
over
her
nose.
Would
you
like
her?”

“What,
and
break
your
heart?”
Tyrion
shot
back.
“I
shall
keep
Shae.
Did
you
perchance
note
the
name
of
this
knight
you
took
her
from?
I’d
rather
not
have
him
beside
me
in
the
battle.”

Bronn
rose,
cat-quick
and
cat-graceful,
turning
his
sword
in
his
hand.
“You’ll
have
me
beside
you
in
the
battle,
dwarf.”

Tyrion
nodded.
The
night
air
was
warm
on
his
bare
skin.
“See
that
I
survive
this
battle,
and
you
can
name
your
reward.”

Bronn
tossed
the
longsword
from
his
right
hand
to
his
left,
and
tried
a
cut.
“Who’d
want
to
kill
the
likes
of
you?”

“My
lord
father,
for
one.
He’s
put
me
in
the
van.”

“I’d
do
the
same.
A
small
man
with
a
big
shield.
You’ll
give
the
archers
fits.”

“I
find
you
oddly
cheering,”
Tyrion
said.
“I
must
be
mad.”

Bronn
sheathed
his
sword.
“Beyond
a
doubt.”

When
Tyrion
returned
to
his
tent,
Shae
rolled
onto
her
elbow
and
murmured
sleepily,
“I
woke
and
m’lord
was
gone.”

“M’lord
is
back
now.”
He
slid
in
beside
her.

Her
hand
went
between
his
stunted
legs,
and
found
him
hard.
“Yes
he
is,”
she
whispered,
stroking
him.

He
asked
her
about
the
man
Bronn
had
taken
her
from,
and
she
named
the
minor
retainer
of
an
insignificant
lordling.
“You
need
not
fear
his
like,
m’lord,”
the
girl
said,
her
fingers
busy
at
his
cock.
“He
is
a
small
man.”

“And
what
am
I,
pray?”
Tyrion
asked
her.
“A
giant?”

“Oh,
yes,”
she
purred,
“my
giant
of
Lannister.”
She
mounted
him
then,
and
for
a
time,
she
almost
made
him
believe
it.
Tyrion
went
to
sleep
smiling…

…
and
woke
in
darkness
to
the
blare
of
trumpets.
Shae
was
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder.
“M’lord,”
she
whispered.
“Wake
up,
m’lord.
I’m
frightened.”

Groggy,
he
sat
up
and
threw
back
the
blanket.
The
horns
called
through
the
night,
wild
and
urgent,
a
cry
that
said
hurry
hurry
hurry.
He
heard
shouts,
the
clatter
of
spears,
the
whicker
of
horses,
though
nothing
yet
that
spoke
to
him
of
fighting.
“My
lord
father’s
trumpets,”
he
said.
“Battle
assembly.
I
thought
Stark
was
yet
a
day’s
march
away.”

Shae
shook
her
head,
lost.
Her
eyes
were
wide
and
white.

Groaning,
Tyrion
lurched
to
his
feet
and
pushed
his
way
outside,
shouting
for
his
squire.
Wisps
of
pale
fog
drifted
through
the
night,
long
white
fingers
off
the
river.
Men
and
horses
blundered
through
the
predawn
chill;
saddles
were
being
cinched,
wagons
loaded,
fires
extinguished.
The
trumpets
blew
again:
hurry
hurry
hurry.
Knights
vaulted
onto
snorting
coursers
while
men-at-arms
buckled
their
sword
belts
as
they
ran.
When
he
found
Pod,
the
boy
was
snoring
softly.
Tyrion
gave
him
a
sharp
poke
in
the
ribs
with
his
toe.
“My
armor,”
he
said,
“and
be
quick
about
it.”
Bronn
came
trotting
out
of
the
mists,
already
armored
and
ahorse,
wearing
his
battered
halfhelm.
“Do
you
know
what’s
happened?”
Tyrion
asked
him.

“The
Stark
boy
stole
a
march
on
us,”
Bronn
said.
“He
crept
down
the
kingsroad
in
the
night,
and
now
his
host
is
less
than
a
mile
north
of
here,
forming
up
in
battle
array.”

Hurry,
the
trumpets
called,
hurry
hurry
hurry.

“See
that
the
clansmen
are
ready
to
ride.”
Tyrion
ducked
back
inside
his
tent.
“Where
are
my
clothes?”
he
barked
at
Shae.
“There.
No,
the
leather,
damn
it.
Yes.
Bring
me
my
boots.”

By
the
time
he
was
dressed,
his
squire
had
laid
out
his
armor,
such
that
it
was.
Tyrion
owned
a
fine
suit
of
heavy
plate,
expertly
crafted
to
fit
his
misshapen
body.
Alas,
it
was
safe
at
Casterly
Rock,
and
he
was
not.
He
had
to
make
do
with
oddments
assembled
from
Lord
Lefford’s
wagons:
mail
hauberk
and
coif,
a
dead
knight’s
gorget,
lobstered
greaves
and
gauntlets
and
pointed
steel
boots.
Some
of
it
was
ornate,
some
plain;
not
a
bit
of
it
matched,
or
fit
as
it
should.
His
breastplate
was
meant
for
a
bigger
man;
for
his
oversize
head,
they
found
a
huge
bucket-shaped
greathelm
topped
with
a
foot-long
triangular
spike.

Shae
helped
Pod
with
the
buckles
and
clasps.
“If
I
die,
weep
for
me,”
Tyrion
told
the
whore.

“How
will
you
know?
You’ll
be
dead.”

“I’ll
know.”

“I
believe
you
would.”
Shae
lowered
the
greathelm
down
over
his
head,
and
Pod
fastened
it
to
his
gorget.
Tyrion
buckled
on
his
belt,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
shortsword
and
dirk.
By
then
his
groom
had
brought
up
his
mount,
a
formidable
brown
courser
armored
as
heavily
as
he
was.
He
needed
help
to
mount;
he
felt
as
though
he
weighed
a
thousand
stone.
Pod
handed
him
up
his
shield,
a
massive
slab
of
heavy
ironwood
banded
with
steel.
Lastly
they
gave
him
his
battle-axe.
Shae
stepped
back
and
looked
him
over.
“M’lord
looks
fearsome.”

“M’lord
looks
a
dwarf
in
mismatched
armor,”
Tyrion
answered
sourly,
“but
I
thank
you
for
the
kindness.
Podrick,
should
the
battle
go
against
us,
see
the
lady
safely
home.”
He
saluted
her
with
his
axe,
wheeled
his
horse
about,
and
trotted
off.
His
stomach
was
a
hard
knot,
so
tight
it
pained
him.
Behind,
his
servants
hurriedly
began
to
strike
his
tent.
Pale
crimson
fingers
fanned
out
to
the
east
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
broke
over
the
horizon.
The
western
sky
was
a
deep
purple,
speckled
with
stars.
Tyrion
wondered
whether
this
was
the
last
sunrise
he
would
ever
see…
and
whether
wondering
was
a
mark
of
cowardice.
Did
his
brother
Jaime
ever
contemplate
death
before
a
battle?

A
warhorn
sounded
in
the
far
distance,
a
deep
mournful
note
that
chilled
the
soul.
The
clansmen
climbed
onto
their
scrawny
mountain
horses,
shouting
curses
and
rude
jokes.
Several
appeared
to
be
drunk.
The
rising
sun
was
burning
off
the
drifting
tendrils
of
fog
as
Tyrion
led
them
off.
What
grass
the
horses
had
left
was
heavy
with
dew,
as
if
some
passing
god
had
scattered
a
bag
of
diamonds
over
the
earth.
The
mountain
men
fell
in
behind
him,
each
clan
arrayed
behind
its
own
leaders.

In
the
dawn
light,
the
army
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
unfolded
like
an
iron
rose,
thorns
gleaming.

His
uncle
would
lead
the
center.
Ser
Kevan
had
raised
his
standards
above
the
kingsroad.
Quivers
hanging
from
their
belts,
the
foot
archers
arrayed
themselves
into
three
long
lines,
to
east
and
west
of
the
road,
and
stood
calmly
stringing
their
bows.
Between
them,
pikemen
formed
squares;
behind
were
rank
on
rank
of
men-at-arms
with
spear
and
sword
and
axe.
Three
hundred
heavy
horse
surrounded
Ser
Kevan
and
the
lords
bannermen
Lefford,
Lydden,
and
Serrett
with
all
their
sworn
retainers.

The
right
wing
was
all
cavalry,
some
four
thousand
men,
heavy
with
the
weight
of
their
armor.
More
than
three
quarters
of
the
knights
were
there,
massed
together
like
a
great
steel
fist.
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
had
the
command.
Tyrion
saw
his
banner
unfurl
as
his
standardbearer
shook
it
out;
a
burning
tree,
orange
and
smoke.
Behind
him
flew
Ser
Flement’s
purple
unicorn,
the
brindled
boar
of
Crakehall,
the
bantam
rooster
of
Swyft,
and
more.

His
lord
father
took
his
place
on
the
hill
where
he
had
slept.
Around
him,
the
reserve
assembled;
a
huge
force,
half
mounted
and
half
foot,
five
thousand
strong.
Lord
Tywin
almost
always
chose
to
command
the
reserve;
he
would
take
the
high
ground
and
watch
the
battle
unfold
below
him,
committing
his
forces
when
and
where
they
were
needed
most.

Even
from
afar,
his
lord
father
was
resplendent.
Tywin
Lannister’s
battle
armor
put
his
son
Jaime’s
gilded
suit
to
shame.
His
greatcloak
was
sewn
from
countless
layers
of
cloth-of-gold,
so
heavy
that
it
barely
stirred
even
when
he
charged,
so
large
that
its
drape
covered
most
of
his
stallion’s
hindquarters
when
he
took
the
saddle.
No
ordinary
clasp
would
suffice
for
such
a
weight,
so
the
greatcloak
was
held
in
place
by
a
matched
pair
of
miniature
lionesses
crouching
on
his
shoulders,
as
if
poised
to
spring.
Their
mate,
a
male
with
a
magnificent
mane,
reclined
atop
Lord
Tywin’s
greathelm,
one
paw
raking
the
air
as
he
roared.
All
three
lions
were
wrought
in
gold,
with
ruby
eyes.
His
armor
was
heavy
steel
plate,
enameled
in
a
dark
crimson,
greaves
and
gauntlets
inlaid
with
ornate
gold
scrollwork.
His
rondels
were
golden
sunbursts,
all
his
fastenings
were
gilded,
and
the
red
steel
was
burnished
to
such
a
high
sheen
that
it
shone
like
fire
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun.

Tyrion
could
hear
the
rumble
of
the
foemen’s
drums
now.
He
remembered
Robb
Stark
as
he
had
last
seen
him,
in
his
father’s
high
seat
in
the
Great
Hall
of
Winterfell,
a
sword
naked
and
shining
in
his
hands.
He
remembered
how
the
direwolves
had
come
at
him
out
of
the
shadows,
and
suddenly
he
could
see
them
again,
snarling
and
snapping,
teeth
bared
in
his
face.
Would
the
boy
bring
his
wolves
to
war
with
him?
The
thought
made
him
uneasy.

The
northerners
would
be
exhausted
after
their
long
sleepless
march.
Tyrion
wondered
what
the
boy
had
been
thinking.
Did
he
think
to
take
them
unawares
while
they
slept?
Small
chance
of
that;
whatever
else
might
be
said
of
him,
Tywin
Lannister
was
no
man’s
fool.

The
van
was
massing
on
the
left.
He
saw
the
standard
first,
three
black
dogs
on
a
yellow
field.
Ser
Gregor
sat
beneath
it,
mounted
on
the
biggest
horse
Tyrion
had
ever
seen.
Bronn
took
one
look
at
him
and
grinned.
“Always
follow
a
big
man
into
battle.”

Tyrion
threw
him
a
hard
look.
“And
why
is
that?”

“They
make
such
splendid
targets.
That
one,
he’ll
draw
the
eyes
of
every
bowman
on
the
field.”

Laughing,
Tyrion
regarded
the
Mountain
with
fresh
eyes.
“I
confess,
I
had
not
considered
it
in
that
light.”

Clegane
had
no
splendor
about
him;
his
armor
was
steel
plate,
dull
grey,
scarred
by
hard
use
and
showing
neither
sigil
nor
ornament.
He
was
pointing
men
into
position
with
his
blade,
a
two-handed
greatsword
that
Ser
Gregor
waved
about
with
one
hand
as
a
lesser
man
might
wave
a
dagger.
“Any
man
runs,
I’ll
cut
him
down
myself,”
he
was
roaring
when
he
caught
sight
of
Tyrion.
“Imp!
Take
the
left.
Hold
the
river.
If
you
can.”

The
left
of
the
left.
To
turn
their
flank,
the
Starks
would
need
horses
that
could
run
on
water.
Tyrion
led
his
men
toward
the
riverbank.
“Look,”
he
shouted,
pointing
with
his
axe.
“The
river.”
A
blanket
of
pale
mist
still
clung
to
the
surface
of
the
water,
the
murky
green
current
swirling
past
underneath.
The
shallows
were
muddy
and
choked
with
reeds.
“That
river
is
ours.
Whatever
happens,
keep
close
to
the
water.
Never
lose
sight
of
it.
Let
no
enemy
come
between
us
and
our
river.
If
they
dirty
our
waters,
hack
off
their
cocks
and
feed
them
to
the
fishes.”

Shagga
had
an
axe
in
either
hand.
He
smashed
them
together
and
made
them
ring.
“Halfman!”
he
shouted.
Other
Stone
Crows
picked
up
the
cry,
and
the
Black
Ears
and
Moon
Brothers
as
well.
The
Burned
Men
did
not
shout,
but
they
rattled
their
swords
and
spears.
“Halfman!
Halfman!
Halfman!”

Tyrion
turned
his
courser
in
a
circle
to
look
over
the
field.
The
ground
was
rolling
and
uneven
here;
soft
and
muddy
near
the
river,
rising
in
a
gentle
slope
toward
the
kingsroad,
stony
and
broken
beyond
it,
to
the
cast.
A
few
trees
spotted
the
hillsides,
but
most
of
the
land
had
been
cleared
and
planted.
His
heart
pounded
in
his
chest
in
time
to
the
drums,
and
under
his
layers
of
leather
and
steel
his
brow
was
cold
with
sweat.
He
watched
Ser
Gregor
as
the
Mountain
rode
up
and
down
the
line,
shouting
and
gesticulating.
This
wing
too
was
all
cavalry,
but
where
the
right
was
a
mailed
fist
of
knights
and
heavy
lancers,
the
vanguard
was
made
up
of
the
sweepings
of
the
west:
mounted
archers
in
leather
jerkins,
a
swarming
mass
of
undisciplined
freeriders
and
sellswords,
fieldhands
on
plow
horses
armed
with
scythes
and
their
fathers’
rusted
swords,
half-trained
boys
from
the
stews
of
Lannisport…
and
Tyrion
and
his
mountain
clansmen.

“Crow
food,”
Bronn
muttered
beside
him,
giving
voice
to
what
Tyrion
had
left
unsaid.
He
could
only
nod.
Had
his
lord
father
taken
leave
of
his
senses?
No
pikes,
too
few
bowmen,
a
bare
handful
of
knights,
the
ill-armed
and
unarmored,
commanded
by
an
unthinking
brute
who
led
with
his
rage…
how
could
his
father
expect
this
travesty
of
a
battle
to
hold
his
left?

He
had
no
time
to
think
about
it.
The
drums
were
so
near
that
the
beat
crept
under
his
skin
and
set
his
hands
to
twitching.
Bronn
drew
his
longsword,
and
suddenly
the
enemy
was
there
before
them,
boiling
over
the
tops
of
the
hills,
advancing
with
measured
tread
behind
a
wall
of
shields
and
pikes.

Gods
be
damned,
look
at
them
all,
Tyrion
thought,
though
he
knew
his
father
had
more
men
on
the
field.
Their
captains
led
them
on
armored
warhorses,
standard-bearers
riding
alongside
with
their
banners.
He
glimpsed
the
bull
moose
of
the
Hornwoods,
the
Karstark
sunburst,
Lord
Cerwyn’s
battle-axe,
and
the
mailed
fist
of
the
Glovers…
and
the
twin
towers
of
Frey,
blue
on
grey.
So
much
for
his
father’s
certainty
that
Lord
Walder
would
not
bestir
himself.
The
white
of
House
Stark
was
seen
everywhere,
the
grey
direwolves
seeming
to
run
and
leap
as
the
banners
swirled
and
streamed
from
the
high
staffs.
Where
is
the
boy?
Tyrion
wondered.

A
warhorn
blew.
Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo,
it
cried,
its
voice
as
long
and
low
and
chilling
as
a
cold
wind
from
the
north.
The
Lannister
trumpets
answered,
da-DA
da-DA
da-DAAAAAAAAA,
brazen
and
defiant,
yet
it
seemed
to
Tyrion
that
they
sounded
somehow
smaller,
more
anxious.
He
could
feel
a
fluttering
in
his
bowels,
a
queasy
liquid
feeling;
he
hoped
he
was
not
going
to
die
sick.

As
the
horns
died
away,
a
hissing
filled
the
air;
a
vast
flight
of
arrows
arched
up
from
his
right,
where
the
archers
stood
flanking
the
road.
The
northerners
broke
into
a
run,
shouting
as
they
came,
but
the
Lannister
arrows
fell
on
them
like
hail,
hundreds
of
arrows,
thousands,
and
shouts
turned
to
screams
as
men
stumbled
and
went
down.
By
then
a
second
flight
was
in
the
air,
and
the
archers
were
fitting
a
third
arrow
to
their
bowstrings.

The
trumpets
blared
again,
da-DAAA
da-DAAA
da-DA
da-DA
da-DAAAAAAA.
Ser
Gregor
waved
his
huge
sword
and
bellowed
a
command,
and
a
thousand
other
voices
screamed
back
at
him.
Tyrion
put
his
spurs
to
his
horse
and
added
one
more
voice
to
the
cacophony,
and
the
van
surged
forward.
“The
river!”
he
shouted
at
his
clansmen
as
they
rode.
“Remember,
hew
to
the
river.”
He
was
still
leading
when
they
broke
a
canter,
until
Chella
gave
a
bloodcurdling
shriek
and
galloped
past
him,
and
Shagga
howled
and
followed.
The
clansmen
charged
after
them,
leaving
Tyrion
in
their
dust.

A
crescent
of
enemy
spearmen
had
formed
ahead,
a
double
hedgehog
bristling
with
steel,
waiting
behind
tall
oaken
shields
marked
with
the
sunburst
of
Karstark.
Gregor
Clegane
was
the
first
to
reach
them,
leading
a
wedge
of
armored
veterans.
Half
the
horses
shied
at
the
last
second,
breaking
their
charge
before
the
row
of
spears.
The
others
died,
sharp
steel
points
ripping
through
their
chests.
Tyrion
saw
a
dozen
men
go
down.
The
Mountain’s
stallion
reared,
lashing
out
with
iron-shod
hooves
as
a
barbed
spearhead
raked
across
his
neck.
Maddened,
the
beast
lunged
into
the
ranks.
Spears
thrust
at
him
from
every
side,
but
the
shield
wall
broke
beneath
his
weight.
The
northerners
stumbled
away
from
the
animal’s
death
throes.
As
his
horse
fell,
snorting
blood
and
biting
with
his
last
red
breath,
the
Mountain
rose
untouched,
laying
about
him
with
his
two-handed
greatsword.

Shagga
went
bursting
through
the
gap
before
the
shields
could
close,
other
Stone
Crows
hard
behind
him.
Tyrion
shouted,
“Burned
Men!
Moon
Brothers!
After
me!”
but
most
of
them
were
ahead
of
him.
He
glimpsed
Timett
son
of
Timett
vault
free
as
his
mount
died
under
him
in
full
stride,
saw
a
Moon
Brother
impaled
on
a
Karstark
spear,
watched
Conn’s
horse
shatter
a
man’s
ribs
with
a
kick.
A
flight
of
arrows
descended
on
them;
where
they
came
from
he
could
not
say,
but
they
fell
on
Stark
and
Lannister
alike,
rattling
off
armor
or
finding
flesh.
Tyrion
lifted
his
shield
and
hid
beneath
it.

The
hedgehog
was
crumbling,
the
northerners
reeling
back
under
the
impact
of
the
mounted
assault.
Tyrion
saw
Shagga
catch
a
spearman
full
in
the
chest
as
the
fool
came
on
at
a
run,
saw
his
axe
shear
through
mail
and
leather
and
muscle
and
lungs.
The
man
was
dead
on
his
feet,
the
axehead
lodged
in
his
breast,
yet
Shagga
rode
on,
cleaving
a
shield
in
two
with
his
left-hand
battle-axe
while
the
corpse
was
bouncing
and
stumbling
bonelessly
along
on
his
right.
Finally
the
dead
man
slid
off.
Shagga
smashed
the
two
axes
together
and
roared.

By
then
the
enemy
was
on
him,
and
Tyrion’s
battle
shrunk
to
the
few
feet
of
ground
around
his
horse.
A
man-at-arms
thrust
at
his
chest
and
his
axe
lashed
out,
knocking
the
spear
aside.
The
man
danced
back
for
another
try,
but
Tyrion
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
right
over
him.
Bronn
was
surrounded
by
three
foes,
but
he
lopped
the
head
off
the
first
spear
that
came
at
him,
and
raked
his
blade
across
a
second
man’s
face
on
his
backslash.

A
thrown
spear
came
hurtling
at
Tyrion
from
the
left
and
lodged
in
his
shield
with
a
woody
chunk.
He
wheeled
and
raced
after
the
thrower,
but
the
man
raised
his
own
shield
over
his
head.
Tyrion
circled
around
him,
raining
axe
blows
down
on
the
wood.
Chips
of
oak
went
flying,
until
the
northerner
lost
his
feet
and
slipped,
failing
flat
on
his
back
with
his
shield
on
top
of
him.
He
was
below
the
reach
of
Tyrion’s
axe
and
it
was
too
much
bother
to
dismount,
so
he
left
him
there
and
rode
after
another
man,
taking
him
from
behind
with
a
sweeping
downcut
that
sent
a
jolt
of
impact
up
his
arm.
That
won
him
a
moment’s
respite.
Reining
up,
he
looked
for
the
river.
There
it
was,
off
to
the
right.
Somehow
he
had
gotten
turned
around.

A
Burned
Man
rode
past,
slumped
against
his
horse.
A
spear
had
entered
his
belly
and
come
out
through
his
back.
He
was
past
any
help,
but
when
Tyrion
saw
one
of
the
northerners
run
up
and
make
a
grab
for
his
reins,
he
charged.

His
quarry
met
him
sword
in
hand.
He
was
tall
and
spare,
wearing
a
long
chainmail
hauberk
and
gauntlets
of
lobstered
steel,
but
he’d
lost
his
helm
and
blood
ran
down
into
his
eyes
from
a
gash
across
his
forehead.
Tyrion
aimed
a
swipe
at
his
face,
but
the
tall
man
slammed
it
aside.
“Dwarf,”
he
screamed.
“Die.”
He
turned
in
a
circle
as
Tyrion
rode
around
him,
hacking
at
his
head
and
shoulders.
Steel
rang
on
steel,
and
Tyrion
soon
realized
that
the
tall
man
was
quicker
and
stronger
than
he
was.
Where
in
the
seven
hells
was
Bronn?
“Die,”
the
man
grunted,
chopping
at
him
savagely.
Tyrion
barely
got
his
shield
up
in
time,
and
the
wood
seemed
to
explode
inward
under
the
force
of
the
blow.
The
shattered
pieces
fell
away
from
his
arm.
“Die!”
the
swordsman
bellowed,
shoving
in
close
and
whanging
Tyrion
across
the
temple
so
hard
his
head
rang.
The
blade
made
a
hideous
scraping
sound
as
he
drew
it
back
over
the
steel.
The
tall
man
grinned…
until
Tyrion’s
destrier
bit,
quick
as
a
snake,
laying
his
cheek
bare
to
the
bone.
Then
he
screamed.
Tyrion
buried
his
axe
in
his
head.
“You
die,”
he
told
him,
and
he
did.

As
he
wrenched
the
blade
free,
he
heard
a
shout.
‘Eddard!”
a
voice
rang
out.
“For
Eddard
and
Winterfell!”
The
knight
came
thundering
down
on
him,
swinging
the
spiked
ball
of
a
morningstar
around
his
head.
Their
warhorses
slammed
together
before
Tyrion
could
so
much
as
open
his
mouth
to
shout
for
Bronn.
His
right
elbow
exploded
with
pain
as
the
spikes
punched
through
the
thin
metal
around
the
joint.
His
axe
was
gone,
as
fast
as
that.
He
clawed
for
his
sword,
but
the
morningstar
was
circling
again,
coming
at
his
face.
A
sickening
crunch,
and
he
was
falling.
He
did
not
recall
hitting
the
ground,
but
when
he
looked
up
there
was
only
sky
above
him.
He
rolled
onto
his
side
and
tried
to
find
his
feet,
but
pain
shuddered
through
him
and
the
world
throbbed.
The
knight
who
had
felled
him
drew
up
above
him.
“Tyrion
the
Imp,”
he
boomed
down.
“You
are
mine.
Do
you
yield,
Lannister?”

Yes,
Tyrion
thought,
but
the
word
caught
in
his
throat.
He
made
a
croaking
sound
and
fought
his
way
to
his
knees,
fumbling
for
a
weapon.
His
sword,
his
dirk,
anything…

“Do
you
yield?”
The
knight
loomed
overhead
on
his
armored
warhorse.
Man
and
horse
both
seemed
immense.
The
spiked
ball
swung
in
a
lazy
circle.
Tyrion’s
hands
were
numb,
his
vision
blurred,
his
scabbard
empty.
“Yield
or
die,”
the
knight
declared,
his
flail
whirling
faster
and
faster.

Tyrion
lurched
to
his
feet,
driving
his
head
into
the
horse’s
belly.
The
animal
gave
a
hideous
scream
and
reared.
It
tried
to
twist
away
from
the
agony,
a
shower
of
blood
and
viscera
poured
down
over
Tyrion’s
face,
and
the
horse
fell
like
an
avalanche.
The
next
he
knew,
his
visor
was
packed
with
mud
and
something
was
crushing
his
foot.
He
wriggled
free,
his
throat
so
tight
he
could
scarce
talk.
“…yield…”
he
managed
to
croak
faintly.

“Yes,”
a
voice
moaned,
thick
with
pain.

Tyrion
scraped
the
mud
off
his
helm
so
he
could
see
again.
The
horse
had
fallen
away
from
him,
onto
its
rider.
The
knight’s
leg
was
trapped,
the
arm
he’d
used
to
break
his
fall
twisted
at
a
grotesque
angle.
“Yield,”
he
repeated.
Fumbling
at
his
belt
with
his
good
hand,
he
drew
a
sword
and
flung
it
at
Tyrion’s
feet.
“I
yield,
my
lord.”

Dazed,
the
dwarf
knelt
and
lifted
the
blade.
Pain
hammered
through
his
elbow
when
he
moved
his
arm.
The
battle
seemed
to
have
moved
beyond
him.
No
one
remained
on
his
part
of
the
field
save
a
large
number
of
corpses.
Ravens
were
already
circling
and
landing
to
feed.
He
saw
that
Ser
Kevan
had
brought
up
his
center
in
support
of
the
van;
his
huge
mass
of
pikemen
had
pushed
the
northerners
back
against
the
hills.
They
were
struggling
on
the
slopes,
pikes
thrusting
against
another
wall
of
shields,
these
oval
and
reinforced
with
iron
studs.
As
he
watched,
the
air
filled
with
arrows
again,
and
the
men
behind
the
oak
wall
crumbled
beneath
the
murderous
fire.
“I
believe
you
are
losing,
ser,”
he
told
the
knight
under
the
horse.
The
man
made
no
reply.

The
sound
of
hooves
coming
up
behind
him
made
him
whirl,
though
he
could
scarcely
lift
the
sword
he
held
for
the
agony
in
his
elbow.
Brorm
reined
up
and
looked
down
on
him.

“Small
use
you
turned
out
to
be,”
Tyrion
told
him.

“It
would
seem
you
did
well
enough
on
your
own,”
Bronn
answered.
“You’ve
lost
the
spike
off
your
helm,
though.”

Tyrion
groped
at
the
top
of
the
greathelm.
The
spike
had
snapped
off
clean.
“I
haven’t
lost
it.
I
know
just
where
it
is.
Do
you
see
my
horse?”

By
the
time
they
found
it,
the
trumpets
had
sounded
again
and
Lord
Tywin’s
reserve
came
sweeping
up
along
the
river.
Tyrion
watched
his
father
fly
past,
the
crimson-and-gold
banner
of
Lannister
rippling
over
his
head
as
he
thundered
across
the
field.
Five
hundred
knights
surrounded
him,
sunlight
flashing
off
the
points
of
their
lances.
The
remnants
of
the
Stark
lines
shattered
like
glass
beneath
the
hammer
of
their
charge.

With
his
elbow
swollen
and
throbbing
inside
his
armor,
Tyrion
made
no
attempt
to
join
the
slaughter.
He
and
Bronn
went
looking
for
his
men.
Many
he
found
among
the
dead.
Ulf
son
of
Umar
lay
in
a
pool
of
congealing
blood,
his
arm
gone
at
the
elbow,
a
dozen
of
his
Moon
Brothers
sprawled
around
him.
Shagga
was
slumped
beneath
a
tree,
riddled
with
arrows,
Conn’s
head
in
his
lap.
Tyrion
thought
they
were
both
dead,
but
as
he
dismounted,
Shagga
opened
his
eyes
and
said,
“They
have
killed
Conn
son
of
Coratt.”
Handsome
Conn
had
no
mark
but
for
the
red
stain
over
his
breast,
where
the
spear
thrust
had
killed
him.
When
Bronn
pulled
Shagga
to
his
feet,
the
big
man
seemed
to
notice
the
arrows
for
the
first
time.
He
plucked
them
out
one
by
one,
cursing
the
holes
they
had
made
in
his
layers
of
mail
and
leather,
and
yowling
like
a
babe
at
the
few
that
had
buried
themselves
in
his
flesh.
Chella
daughter
of
Cheyk
rode
up
as
they
were
yanking
arrows
out
of
Shagga,
and
showed
them
four
ears
she
had
taken.
Timett
they
discovered
looting
the
bodies
of
the
slain
with
his
Burned
Men.
Of
the
three
hundred
clansmen
who
had
ridden
to
battle
behind
Tyrion
Lannister,
perhaps
half
had
survived.

He
left
the
living
to
look
after
the
dead,
sent
Bronn
to
take
charge
of
his
captive
knight,
and
went
alone
in
search
of
his
father.
Lord
Tywin
was
seated
by
the
river,
sipping
wine
from
a
jeweled
cup
as
his
squire
undid
the
fastenings
on
his
breastplate.
“A
fine
victory,”
Ser
Kevan
said
when
he
saw
Tyrion.
“Your
wild
men
fought
well.”

His
father’s
eyes
were
on
him,
pale
green
flecked
with
gold,
so
cool
they
gave
Tyrion
a
chill.
“Did
that
surprise
you,
Father?”
he
asked.
“Did
it
upset
your
plans?
We
were
supposed
to
be
butchered,
were
we
not?”

Lord
Tywin
drained
his
cup,
his
face
expressionless.
“I
put
the
least
disciplined
men
on
the
left,
yes.
I
anticipated
that
they
would
break.
Robb
Stark
is
a
green
boy,
more
like
to
be
brave
than
wise.
I’d
hoped
that
if
he
saw
our
left
collapse,
he
might
plunge
into
the
gap,
eager
for
a
rout.
Once
he
was
fully
committed,
Ser
Kevan’s
pikes
would
wheel
and
take
him
in
the
flank,
driving
him
into
the
river
while
I
brought
up
the
reserve.”

“And
you
thought
it
best
to
place
me
in
the
midst
of
this
carnage,
yet
keep
me
ignorant
of
your
plans.”

“A
feigned
rout
is
less
convincing,”
his
father
said,
“and
I
am
not
inclined
to
trust
my
plans
to
a
man
who
consorts
with
sellswords
and
savages.”

“A
pity
my
savages
ruined
your
dance.”
Tyrion
pulled
off
his
steel
gauntlet
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground,
wincing
at
the
pain
that
stabbed
up
his
arm.

“The
Stark
boy
proved
more
cautious
than
I
expected
for
one
of
his
years,”
Lord
Tywin
admitted,
“but
a
victory
is
a
victory.
You
appear
to
be
wounded.”

Tyrion’s
right
arm
was
soaked
with
blood.
“Good
of
you
to
notice,
Father,”
he
said
through
clenched
teeth.
“Might
I
trouble
you
to
send
for
your
maesters?
Unless
you
relish
the
notion
of
having
a
one-armed
dwarf
for
a
son…”

An
urgent
shout
of
“Lord
Tywin!”
turned
his
father’s
head
before
he
could
reply.
Tywin
Lannister
rose
to
his
feet
as
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
leapt
down
off
his
courser.
The
horse
was
lathered
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth.
Ser
Addam
dropped
to
one
knee,
a
rangy
man
with
dark
copper
hair
that
fell
to
his
shoulders,
armored
in
burnished
bronzed
steel
with
the
fiery
tree
of
his
House
etched
black
on
his
breastplate.
“My
liege,
we
have
taken
some
of
their
commanders.
Lord
Cerwyn,
Ser
Wylis
Manderly,
Harrion
Karstark,
four
Freys.
Lord
Hornwood
is
dead,
and
I
fear
Roose
Bolton
has
escaped
us.”

“And
the
boy?”
Lord
Tywin
asked.

Ser
Addam
hesitated.
“The
Stark
boy
was
not
with
them,
my
lord.
They
say
he
crossed
at
the
Twins
with
the
great
part
of
his
horse,
riding
hard
for
Riverrun.”

A
green
boy,
Tyrion
remembered,
more
like
to
be
brave
than
wise.
He
would
have
laughed,
if
he
hadn’t
hurt
so
much.





CATELYN

The
woods
were
full
of
whispers.

Moonlight
winked
on
the
tumbling
waters
of
the
stream
below
as
it
wound
its
rocky
way
along
the
floor
of
the
valley.
Beneath
the
trees,
warhorses
whickered
softly
and
pawed
at
the
moist,
leafy
ground,
while
men
made
nervous
jests
in
hushed
voices.
Now
and
again,
she
heard
the
chink
of
spears,
the
faint
metallic
slither
of
chain
mail,
but
even
those
sounds
were
muffled.

“It
should
not
be
long
now,
my
lady,”
Hallis
Mollen
said.
He
had
asked
for
the
honor
of
protecting
her
in
the
battle
to
come;
it
was
his
right,
as
Winterfell’s
captain
of
guards,
and
Robb
had
not
refused
it
to
him.
She
had
thirty
men
around
her,
charged
to
keep
her
unharmed
and
see
her
safely
home
to
Winterfell
if
the
fighting
went
against
them.
Robb
had
wanted
fifty;
Catelyn
had
insisted
that
ten
would
be
enough,
that
he
would
need
every
sword
for
the
fight.
They
made
their
peace
at
thirty,
neither
happy
with
it.

“It
will
come
when
it
comes,”
Catelyn
told
him.
When
it
came,
she
knew
it
would
mean
death.
Hal’s
death
perhaps…
or
hers,
or
Robb’s.
No
one
was
safe.
No
life
was
certain.
Catelyn
was
content
to
wait,
to
listen
to
the
whispers
in
the
woods
and
the
faint
music
of
the
brook,
to
feel
the
warm
wind
in
her
hair.

She
was
no
stranger
to
waiting,
after
all.
Her
men
had
always
made
her
wait.
“Watch
for
me,
little
cat,”
her
father
would
always
tell
her,
when
he
rode
off
to
court
or
fair
or
battle.
And
she
would,
standing
patiently
on
the
battlements
of
Riverrun
as
the
waters
of
the
Red
Fork
and
the
Tumblestone
flowed
by.
He
did
not
always
come
when
he
said
he
would,
and
days
would
ofttimes
pass
as
Catelyn
stood
her
vigil,
peering
out
between
crenels
and
through
arrow
loops
until
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
Lord
Hoster
on
his
old
brown
gelding,
trotting
along
the
rivershore
toward
the
landing.
“Did
you
watch
for
me?”
he’d
ask
when
he
bent
to
bug
her.
“Did
you,
little
cat?”

Brandon
Stark
had
bid
her
wait
as
well.
“I
shall
not
be
long,
my
lady,”
he
had
vowed.
“We
will
be
wed
on
my
return.”
Yet
when
the
day
came
at
last,
it
was
his
brother
Eddard
who
stood
beside
her
in
the
sept.

Ned
had
lingered
scarcely
a
fortnight
with
his
new
bride
before
he
too
had
ridden
off
to
war
with
promises
on
his
lips.
At
least
he
had
left
her
with
more
than
words;
he
had
given
her
a
son.
Nine
moons
had
waxed
and
waned,
and
Robb
had
been
born
in
Riverrun
while
his
father
still
warred
in
the
south.
She
had
brought
him
forth
in
blood
and
pain,
not
knowing
whether
Ned
would
ever
see
him.
Her
son.
He
had
been
so
small…

And
now
it
was
for
Robb
that
she
waited…
for
Robb,
and
for
Jaime
Lannister,
the
gilded
knight
who
men
said
had
never
learned
to
wait
at
all.
“The
Kingslayer
is
restless,
and
quick
to
anger,”
her
uncle
Brynden
had
told
Robb.
And
he
had
wagered
their
lives
and
their
best
hope
of
victory
on
the
truth
of
what
he
said.

If
Robb
was
frightened,
he
gave
no
sign
of
it.
Catelyn
watched
her
son
as
he
moved
among
the
men,
touching
one
on
the
shoulder,
sharing
a
jest
with
another,
helping
a
third
to
gentle
an
anxious
horse.
His
armor
clinked
softly
when
he
moved.
Only
his
head
was
bare.
Catelyn
watched
a
breeze
stir
his
auburn
hair,
so
like
her
own,
and
wondered
when
her
son
had
grown
so
big.
Fifteen,
and
near
as
tall
as
she
was.

Let
him
grow
taller,
she
asked
the
gods.
Let
him
know
sixteen,
and
twenty,
and
fifty.
Let
him
grow
as
tall
as
his
father,
and
hold
his
own
son
in
his
arms.
Please,
please,
please.
As
she
watched
him,
this
tall
young
man
with
the
new
beard
and
the
direwolf
prowling
at
his
heels,
all
she
could
see
was
the
babe
they
had
laid
at
her
breast
at
Riverrun,
so
long
ago.

The
night
was
warm,
but
the
thought
of
Riverrun
was
enough
to
make
her
shiver.
Where
are
they?
she
wondered.
Could
her
uncle
have
been
wrong?
So
much
rested
on
the
truth
of
what
he
had
told
them.
Robb
had
given
the
Blackfish
three
hundred
picked
men,
and
sent
them
ahead
to
screen
his
march.
“Jaime
does
not
know,”
Ser
Brynden
said
when
he
rode
back.
“I’ll
stake
my
life
on
that.
No
bird
has
reached
him,
my
archers
have
seen
to
that.
We’ve
seen
a
few
of
his
outriders,
but
those
that
saw
us
did
not
live
to
tell
of
it.
He
ought
to
have
sent
out
more.
He
does
not
know.”

“How
large
is
his
host?”
her
son
asked.

“Twelve
thousand
foot,
scattered
around
the
castle
in
three
separate
camps,
with
the
rivers
between,”
her
uncle
said,
with
the
craggy
smile
she
remembered
so
well.
“There
is
no
other
way
to
besiege
Riverrun,
yet
still,
that
will
be
their
undoing.
Two
or
three
thousand
horse.”

“The
Kingslayer
has
us
three
to
one,”
said
Galbart
Glover.

‘True
enough,”
Ser
Brynden
said,
“yet
there
is
one
thing
Ser
Jaime
lacks.”

“Yes?”
Robb
asked.

“Patience.”

Their
host
was
greater
than
it
had
been
when
they
left
the
Twins.
Lord
Jason
Mallister
had
brought
his
power
out
from
Seagard
to
join
them
as
they
swept
around
the
headwaters
of
the
Blue
Fork
and
galloped
south,
and
others
had
crept
forth
as
well,
hedge
knights
and
small
lords
and
masterless
men-at-arms
who
had
fled
north
when
her
brother
Edmure’s
army
was
shattered
beneath
the
walls
of
Riverrun.
They
had
driven
their
horses
as
hard
as
they
dared
to
reach
this
place
before
Jaime
Lannister
had
word
of
their
coming,
and
now
the
hour
was
at
hand.

Catelyn
watched
her
son
mount
up.
Olyvar
Frey
held
his
horse
for
him,
Lord
Walder’s
son,
two
years
older
than
Robb,
and
ten
years
younger
and
more
anxious.
He
strapped
Robb’s
shield
in
place
and
handed
up
his
helm.
When
he
lowered
it
over
the
face
she
loved
so
well,
a
tall
young
knight
sat
on
his
grey
stallion
where
her
son
had
been.
It
was
dark
among
the
trees,
where
the
moon
did
not
reach.
When
Robb
turned
his
head
to
look
at
her,
she
could
see
only
black
inside
his
visor.
“I
must
ride
down
the
line,
Mother,”
he
told
her.
“Father
says
you
should
let
the
men
see
you
before
a
battle.”

‘Go,
then,”
she
said.
“Let
them
see
you.”

‘It
will
give
them
courage,”
Robb
said.

And
who
will
give
me
courage?
she
wondered,
yet
she
kept
her
silence
and
made
herself
smile
for
him.
Robb
turned
the
big
grey
stallion
and
walked
him
slowly
away
from
her,
Grey
Wind
shadowing
his
steps.
Behind
him
his
battle
guard
formed
up.
When
he’d
forced
Catelyn
to
accept
her
protectors,
she
had
insisted
that
he
be
guarded
as
well,
and
the
lords
bannermen
had
agreed.
Many
of
their
sons
had
clamored
for
the
honor
of
riding
with
the
Young
Wolf,
as
they
had
taken
to
calling
him.
Torrhen
Karstark
and
his
brother
Eddard
were
among
his
thirty,
and
Patrek
Mallister,
Smalljon
Umber,
Daryn
Hornwood,
Theon
Greyjoy,
no
less
than
five
of
Walder
Frey’s
vast
brood,
along
with
older
men
like
Ser
Wendel
Manderly
and
Robin
Flint.
One
of
his
companions
was
even
a
woman:
Dacey
Mormont,
Lady
Maege’s
eldest
daughter
and
heir
to
Bear
Island,
a
lanky
six-footer
who
had
been
given
a
morningstar
at
an
age
when
most
girls
were
given
dolls.
Some
of
the
other
lords
muttered
about
that,
but
Catelyn
would
not
listen
to
their
complaints.
“This
is
not
about
the
honor
of
your
houses,”
she
told
them.
“This
is
about
keeping
my
son
alive
and
whole.”

And
if
it
comes
to
that,
she
wondered,
will
thirty
be
enough?
Will
six
thousand
be
enough?

A
bird
called
faintly
in
the
distance,
a
high
sharp
trill
that
felt
like
an
icy
hand
on
Catelyn’s
neck.
Another
bird
answered;
a
third,
a
fourth.
She
knew
their
call
well
enough,
from
her
years
at
Winterfell.
Snow
shrikes.
Sometimes
you
saw
them
in
the
deep
of
winter,
when
the
godswood
was
white
and
still.
They
were
northern
birds.

They
are
coming,
Catelyn
thought.

“They’re
coming,
my
lady,”
Hal
Mollen
whispered.
He
was
always
a
man
for
stating
the
obvious.
“Gods
be
with
us.”

She
nodded
as
the
woods
grew
still
around
them.
In
the
quiet
she
could
hear
them,
far
off
yet
moving
closer;
the
tread
of
many
horses,
the
rattle
of
swords
and
spears
and
armor,
the
murmur
of
human
voices,
with
here
a
laugh,
and
there
a
curse.

Eons
seemed
to
come
and
go.
The
sounds
grew
louder.
She
heard
more
laughter,
a
shouted
command,
splashing
as
they
crossed
and
recrossed
the
little
stream.
A
horse
snorted.
A
man
swore.
And
then
at
last
she
saw
him…
only
for
an
instant,
framed
between
the
branches
of
the
trees
as
she
looked
down
at
the
valley
floor,
yet
she
knew
it
was
him.
Even
at
a
distance,
Ser
Jaime
Lannister
was
unmistakable.
The
moonlight
had
silvered
his
armor
and
the
gold
of
his
hair,
and
turned
his
crimson
cloak
to
black.
He
was
not
wearing
a
helm.

He
was
there
and
he
was
gone
again,
his
silvery
armor
obscured
by
the
trees
once
more.
Others
came
behind
him,
long
columns
of
them,
knights
and
sworn
swords
and
freeriders,
three
quarters
of
the
Lannister
horse.

“He
is
no
man
for
sitting
in
a
tent
while
his
carpenters
build
siege
towers,”
Ser
Brynden
had
promised.
“He
has
ridden
out
with
his
knights
thrice
already,
to
chase
down
raiders
or
storm
a
stubborn
holdfast.”

Nodding,
Robb
had
studied
the
map
her
uncle
had
drawn
him.
Ned
had
taught
him
to
read
maps.
“Raid
him
here,”
he
said,
pointing.
“A
few
hundred
men,
no
more.
Tully
banners.
When
he
comes
after
you,
we
will
be
waiting”—his
finger
moved
an
inch
to
the
left—“here.”

Here
was
a
hush
in
the
night,
moonlight
and
shadows,
a
thick
carpet
of
dead
leaves
underfoot,
densely
wooded
ridges
sloping
gently
down
to
the
streambed,
the
underbrush
thinning
as
the
ground
fell
away.

Here
was
her
son
on
his
stallion,
glancing
back
at
her
one
last
time
and
lifting
his
sword
in
salute.

Here
was
the
call
of
Maege
Mormont’s
warhorn,
a
long
low
blast
that
rolled
down
the
valley
from
the
east,
to
tell
them
that
the
last
of
Jaime’s
riders
had
entered
the
trap.

And
Grey
Wind
threw
back
his
head
and
howled.

The
sound
seemed
to
go
right
through
Catelyn
Stark,
and
she
found
herself
shivering.
It
was
a
terrible
sound,
a
frightening
sound,
yet
there
was
music
in
it
too.
For
a
second
she
felt
something
like
pity
for
the
Lannisters
below.
So
this
is
what
death
sounds
like,
she
thought.

HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo
came
the
answer
from
the
far
ridge
as
the
Greatjon
winded
his
own
horn.
To
east
and
west,
the
trumpets
of
the
Mallisters
and
Freys
blew
vengeance.
North,
where
the
valley
narrowed
and
bent
like
a
cocked
elbow,
Lord
Karstark’s
warhorns
added
their
own
deep,
mournful
voices
to
the
dark
chorus.
Men
were
shouting
and
horses
rearing
in
the
stream
below.

The
whispering
wood
let
out
its
breath
all
at
once,
as
the
bowmen
Robb
had
hidden
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
let
fly
their
arrows
and
the
night
erupted
with
the
screams
of
men
and
horses.
All
around
her,
the
riders
raised
their
lances,
and
the
dirt
and
leaves
that
had
buried
the
cruel
bright
points
fell
away
to
reveal
the
gleam
of
sharpened
steel.
“Winterfell!”
she
heard
Robb
shout
as
the
arrows
sighed
again.
He
moved
away
from
her
at
a
trot,
leading
his
men
downhill.

Catelyn
sat
on
her
horse,
unmoving,
with
Hal
Mollen
and
her
guard
around
her,
and
she
waited
as
she
had
waited
before,
for
Brandon
and
Ned
and
her
father.
She
was
high
on
the
ridge,
and
the
trees
hid
most
of
what
was
going
on
beneath
her.
A
heartbeat,
two,
four,
and
suddenly
it
was
as
if
she
and
her
protectors
were
alone
in
the
wood.
The
rest
were
melted
away
into
the
green.

Yet
when
she
looked
across
the
valley
to
the
far
ridge,
she
saw
the
Greatjon’s
riders
emerge
from
the
darkness
beneath
the
trees.
They
were
in
a
long
line,
an
endless
line,
and
as
they
burst
from
the
wood
there
was
an
instant,
the
smallest
part
of
a
heartbeat,
when
all
Catelyn
saw
was
the
moonlight
on
the
points
of
their
lances,
as
if
a
thousand
willowisps
were
coming
down
the
ridge,
wreathed
in
silver
flame.

Then
she
blinked,
and
they
were
only
men,
rushing
down
to
kill
or
die.

Afterward,
she
could
not
claim
she
had
seen
the
battle.
Yet
she
could
hear,
and
the
valley
rang
with
echoes.
The
crack
of
a
broken
lance,
the
clash
of
swords,
the
cries
of
“Lannister”
and
“Winterfell”
and
“Tully!
Riverrun
and
Tully!”
When
she
realized
there
was
no
more
to
see,
she
closed
her
eyes
and
listened.
The
battle
came
alive
around
her.
She
heard
hoofbeats,
iron
boots
splashing
in
shallow
water,
the
woody
sound
of
swords
on
oaken
shields
and
the
scrape
of
steel
against
steel,
the
hiss
of
arrows,
the
thunder
of
drums,
the
terrified
screaming
of
a
thousand
horses.
Men
shouted
curses
and
begged
for
mercy,
and
got
it
(or
not),
and
lived
(or
died).
The
ridges
seemed
to
play
queer
tricks
with
sound.
Once
she
heard
Robb’s
voice,
as
clear
as
if
he’d
been
standing
at
her
side,
calling,
“To
me!
To
me!”
And
she
heard
his
direwolf,
snarling
and
growling,
heard
the
snap
of
those
long
teeth,
the
tearing
of
flesh,
shrieks
of
fear
and
pain
from
man
and
horse
alike.
Was
there
only
one
wolf?
It
was
hard
to
be
certain.

Little
by
little,
the
sounds
dwindled
and
died,
until
at
last
there
was
only
the
wolf.
As
a
red
dawn
broke
in
the
east,
Grey
Wind
began
to
howl
again.

Robb
came
back
to
her
on
a
different
horse,
riding
a
piebald
gelding
in
the
place
of
the
grey
stallion
he
had
taken
down
into
the
valley.
The
wolf’s
head
on
his
shield
was
slashed
half
to
pieces,
raw
wood
showing
where
deep
gouges
had
been
hacked
in
the
oak,
but
Robb
himself
seemed
unhurt.
Yet
when
he
came
closer,
Catelyn
saw
that
his
mailed
glove
and
the
sleeve
of
his
surcoat
were
black
with
blood.
“You’re
hurt,”
she
said.

Robb
lifted
his
hand,
opened
and
closed
his
fingers.
“No,”
he
said.
“This
is…
Torrhen’s
blood,
perhaps,
or…”
He
shook
his
head.
“I
do
not
know.”

A
mob
of
men
followed
him
up
the
slope,
dirty
and
dented
and
grinning,
with
Theon
and
the
Greatjon
at
their
head.
Between
them
they
dragged
Ser
Jaime
Lannister.
They
threw
him
down
in
front
of
her
horse.
“The
Kingslayer,”
Hal
announced,
unnecessarily.

Lannister
raised
his
head.
“Lady
Stark,”
he
said
from
his
knees.
Blood
ran
down
one
cheek
from
a
gash
across
his
scalp,
but
the
pale
light
of
dawn
had
put
the
glint
of
gold
back
in
his
hair.
“I
would
offer
you
my
sword,
but
I
seem
to
have
mislaid
it.”

“It
is
not
your
sword
I
want,
ser,”
she
told
him.
“Give
me
my
father
and
my
brother
Edmure.
Give
me
my
daughters.
Give
me
my
lord
husband.”

“I
have
mislaid
them
as
well,
I
fear.”

“A
pity,”
Catelyn
said
coldly.

“Kill
him,
Robb,”
Theon
Greyjoy
urged.
“Take
his
head
off.”

“No,”
her
son
answered,
peeling
off
his
bloody
glove.
“He’s
more
use
alive
than
dead.
And
my
lord
father
never
condoned
the
murder
of
prisoners
after
a
battle.”

“A
wise
man,”
Jaime
Lannister
said,
“and
honorable.”

“Take
him
away
and
put
him
in
irons,”
Catelyn
said.

“Do
as
my
lady
mother
says,”
Robb
commanded,
“and
make
certain
there’s
a
strong
guard
around
him.
Lord
Karstark
will
want
his
head
on
a
pike.”

“That
he
will,”
the
Greatjon
agreed,
gesturing.
Lannister
was
led
away
to
be
bandaged
and
chained.

“Why
should
Lord
Karstark
want
him
dead?”
Catelyn
asked.

Robb
looked
away
into
the
woods,
with
the
same
brooding
look
that
Ned
often
got.
“He…
he
killed
them…”

“Lord
Karstark’s
sons,”
Galbart
Glover
explained.

“Both
of
them,”
said
Robb.
“Torrhen
and
Eddard.
And
Daryn
Hornwood
as
well.”

“No
one
can
fault
Lannister
on
his
courage,”
Glover
said.
“When
he
saw
that
he
was
lost,
he
rallied
his
retainers
and
fought
his
way
up
the
valley,
hoping
to
reach
Lord
Robb
and
cut
him
down.
And
almost
did.”

“He
mislaid
his
sword
in
Eddard
Karstark’s
neck,
after
he
took
Torrhen’s
hand
off
and
split
Daryn
Hornwood’s
skull
open,”
Robb
said.
“All
the
time
he
was
shouting
for
me.
If
they
hadn’t
tried
to
stop
him—”

“—I
should
then
be
mourning
in
place
of
Lord
Karstark,”
Catelyn
said.
“Your
men
did
what
they
were
sworn
to
do,
Robb.
They
died
protecting
their
liege
lord.
Grieve
for
them.
Honor
them
for
their
valor.
But
not
now.
You
have
no
time
for
grief.
You
may
have
lopped
the
head
off
the
snake,
but
three
quarters
of
the
body
is
still
coiled
around
my
father’s
castle.
We
have
won
a
battle,
not
a
war.”

“But
such
a
battle!”
said
Theon
Greyjoy
eagerly.
“My
lady,
the
realm
has
not
seen
such
a
victory
since
the
Field
of
Fire.
I
vow,
the
Lannisters
lost
ten
men
for
every
one
of
ours
that
fell.
We’ve
taken
close
to
a
hundred
knights
captive,
and
a
dozen
lords
bannermen.
Lord
Westerling,
Lord
Banefort,
Ser
Garth
Greenfield,
Lord
Estren,
Ser
Tytos
Brax,
Mallor
the
Dornishman…
and
three
Lannisters
besides
Jaime,
Lord
Tywin’s
own
nephews,
two
of
his
sister’s
sons
and
one
of
his
dead
brother’s…”

“And
Lord
Tywin?”
Catelyn
interrupted.
“Have
you
perchance
taken
Lord
Tywin,
Theon?”

“No,”
Greyjoy
answered,
brought
up
short.

“Until
you
do,
this
war
is
far
from
done.”

Robb
raised
his
head
and
pushed
his
hair
back
out
of
his
eyes.
“My
mother
is
right.
We
still
have
Riverrun.”





DAENERYS

The
flies
circled
Khal
Drogo
slowly,
their
wings
buzzing,
a
low
thrum
at
the
edge
of
hearing
that
filled
Dany
with
dread.

The
sun
was
high
and
pitiless.
Heat
shimmered
in
waves
off
the
stony
outcrops
of
low
hills.
A
thin
finger
of
sweat
trickled
slowly
between
Dany’s
swollen
breasts.
The
only
sounds
were
the
steady
clop
of
their
horses’
hooves,
the
rhythmic
tingle
of
the
bells
in
Drogo’s
hair,
and
the
distant
voices
behind
them.

Dany
watched
the
flies.

They
were
as
large
as
bees,
gross,
purplish,
glistening.
The
Dothraki
called
them
bloodflies.
They
lived
in
marshes
and
stagnant
pools,
sucked
blood
from
man
and
horse
alike,
and
laid
their
eggs
in
the
dead
and
dying.
Drogo
hated
them.
Whenever
one
came
near
him,
his
hand
would
shoot
out
quick
as
a
striking
snake
to
close
around
it.
She
had
never
seen
him
miss.
He
would
hold
the
fly
inside
his
huge
fist
long
enough
to
hear
its
frantic
buzzing.
Then
his
fingers
would
tighten,
and
when
he
opened
his
hand
again,
the
fly
would
be
only
a
red
smear
on
his
palm.

Now
one
crept
across
the
rump
of
his
stallion,
and
the
horse
gave
an
angry
flick
of
its
tail
to
brush
it
away.
The
others
flitted
about
Drogo,
closer
and
closer.
The
khal
did
not
react.
His
eyes
were
fixed
on
distant
brown
hills,
the
reins
loose
in
his
hands.
Beneath
his
painted
vest,
a
plaster
of
fig
leaves
and
caked
blue
mud
covered
the
wound
on
his
breast.
The
herbwomen
had
made
it
for
him.
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
poultice
had
itched
and
burned,
and
he
had
torn
it
off
six
days
ago,
cursing
her
for
a
maegi.
The
mud
plaster
was
more
soothing,
and
the
herbwomen
made
him
poppy
wine
as
well.
He’d
been
drinking
it
heavily
these
past
three
days;
when
it
was
not
poppy
wine,
it
was
fermented
mare’s
milk
or
pepper
beer.

Yet
he
scarcely
touched
his
food,
and
he
thrashed
and
groaned
in
the
night.
Dany
could
see
how
drawn
his
face
had
become.
Rhaego
was
restless
in
her
belly,
kicking
like
a
stallion,
yet
even
that
did
not
stir
Drogo’s
interest
as
it
had.
Every
morning
her
eyes
found
fresh
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
when
he
woke
from
his
troubled
sleep.
And
now
this
silence.
It
was
making
her
afraid.
Since
they
had
mounted
up
at
dawn,
he
had
said
not
a
word.
When
she
spoke,
she
got
no
answer
but
a
grunt,
and
not
even
that
much
since
midday.

One
of
the
bloodflies
landed
on
the
bare
skin
of
the
khal’s
shoulder.
Another,
circling,
touched
down
on
his
neck
and
crept
up
toward
his
mouth.
Khal
Drogo
swayed
in
the
saddle,
bells
ringing,
as
his
stallion
kept
onward
at
a
steady
walking
pace.

Dany
pressed
her
heels
into
her
silver
and
rode
closer.
“My
lord,”
she
said
softly.
“Drogo.
My
sun-and-stars.”

He
did
not
seem
to
hear.
The
bloodfly
crawled
up
under
his
drooping
mustache
and
settled
on
his
cheek,
in
the
crease
beside
his
nose.
Dany
gasped,
“Drogo.”
Clumsily
she
reached
over
and
touched
his
arm.

Khal
Drogo
reeled
in
the
saddle,
tilted
slowly,
and
fell
heavily
from
his
horse.
The
flies
scattered
for
a
heartbeat,
and
then
circled
back
to
settle
on
him
where
he
lay.

“No,”
Dany
said,
reining
up.
Heedless
of
her
belly
for
once,
she
scrambled
off
her
silver
and
ran
to
him.

The
grass
beneath
him
was
brown
and
dry.
Drogo
cried
out
in
pain
as
Dany
knelt
beside
him.
His
breath
rattled
harshly
in
his
throat,
and
he
looked
at
her
without
recognition.
“My
horse,”
he
gasped.
Dany
brushed
the
flies
off
his
chest,
smashing
one
as
he
would
have.
His
skin
burned
beneath
her
fingers.

The
khal’s
bloodriders
had
been
following
just
behind
them.
She
heard
Haggo
shout
as
they
galloped
up.
Cohollo
vaulted
from
his
horse.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
he
said
as
he
dropped
to
his
knees.
The
other
two
kept
to
their
mounts.

“No,”
Khal
Drogo
groaned,
struggling
in
Dany’s
arms.
“Must
ride.
Ride.
No.”

“He
fell
from
his
horse,”
Haggo
said,
staring
down.
His
broad
face
was
impassive,
but
his
voice
was
leaden.

“You
must
not
say
that,”
Dany
told
him.
“We
have
ridden
far
enough
today.
We
will
camp
here.”

“Here?”
Haggo
looked
around
them.
The
land
was
brown
and
sere,
inhospitable.
“This
is
no
camping
ground.”

“It
is
not
for
a
woman
to
bid
us
halt,”
said
Qotho,
“not
even
a
khaleesi.”

“We
camp
here,”
Dany
repeated.
“Haggo,
tell
them
Khal
Drogo
commanded
the
halt.
If
any
ask
why,
say
to
them
that
my
time
is
near
and
I
could
not
continue.
Cohollo,
bring
up
the
slaves,
they
must
put
up
the
khal’s
tent
at
once.
Qotho—”

“You
do
not
command
me,
Khaleesi,”
Qotho
said.

“Find
Mirri
Maz
Duur,”
she
told
him.
The
godswife
would
be
walking
among
the
other
Lamb
Men,
in
the
long
column
of
slaves.
“Bring
her
to
me,
with
her
chest.”

Qotho
glared
down
at
her,
his
eyes
hard
as
flint.
“The
maegi.”
He
spat.
“This
I
will
not
do.”

“You
will,”
Dany
said,
“or
when
Drogo
wakes,
he
will
hear
why
you
defied
me.”

Furious,
Qotho
wheeled
his
stallion
around
and
galloped
off
in
anger…
but
Dany
knew
he
would
return
with
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
however
little
he
might
like
it.
The
slaves
erected
Khal
Drogo’s
tent
beneath
a
jagged
outcrop
of
black
rock
whose
shadow
gave
some
relief
from
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
sun.
Even
so,
it
was
stifling
under
the
sandsilk
as
Irri
and
Doreah
helped
Dany
walk
Drogo
inside.
Thick
patterned
carpets
had
been
laid
down
over
the
ground,
and
pillows
scattered
in
the
corners.
Eroeh,
the
timid
girl
Dany
had
rescued
outside
the
mud
walls
of
the
Lamb
Men,
set
up
a
brazier.
They
stretched
Drogo
out
on
a
woven
mat.
“No,”
he
muttered
in
the
Common
Tongue.
“No,
no.”
It
was
all
he
said,
all
he
seemed
capable
of
saying.

Doreah
unhooked
his
medallion
belt
and
stripped
off
his
vest
and
leggings,
while
Jhiqui
knelt
by
his
feet
to
undo
the
laces
of
his
riding
sandals.
Irri
wanted
to
leave
the
tent
flaps
open
to
let
in
the
breeze,
but
Dany
forbade
it.
She
would
not
have
any
see
Drogo
this
way,
in
delirium
and
weakness.
When
her
khas
came
up,
she
posted
them
outside
at
guard.
“Admit
no
one
without
my
leave,”
she
told
Jhogo.
“No
one.”

Eroeh
stared
fearfully
at
Drogo
where
he
lay.
“He
dies,”
she
whispered.

Dany
slapped
her.
“The
khal
cannot
die.
He
is
the
father
of
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.
His
hair
has
never
been
cut.
He
still
wears
the
bells
his
father
gave
him.”

“Khaleesi,”
Jhiqui
said,
“he
fell
from
his
horse.”

Trembling,
her
eyes
full
of
sudden
tears,
Dany
turned
away
from
them.
He
fell
from
his
horse!
It
was
so,
she
had
seen
it,
and
the
bloodriders,
and
no
doubt
her
handmaids
and
the
men
of
her
khas
as
well.
And
how
many
more?
They
could
not
keep
it
secret,
and
Dany
knew
what
that
meant.
A
khal
who
could
not
ride
could
not
rule,
and
Drogo
had
fallen
from
his
horse.

“We
must
bathe
him,”
she
said
stubbornly.
She
must
not
allow
herself
to
despair.
“Irri,
have
the
tub
brought
at
once.
Doreah,
Eroeh,
find
water,
cool
water,
he’s
so
hot.”
He
was
a
fire
in
human
skin.

The
slaves
set
up
the
heavy
copper
tub
in
the
corner
of
the
tent.
When
Doreah
brought
the
first
jar
of
water,
Dany
wet
a
length
of
silk
to
lay
across
Drogo’s
brow,
over
the
burning
skin.
His
eyes
looked
at
her,
but
he
did
not
see.
When
his
lips
opened,
no
words
escaped
them,
only
a
moan.
“Where
is
Mirri
Maz
Duur?”
she
demanded,
her
patience
rubbed
raw
with
fear.

“Qotho
will
find
her,”
Irri
said.

Her
handmaids
filled
the
tub
with
tepid
water
that
stank
of
sulfur,
sweetening
it
with
jars
of
bitter
oil
and
handfuls
of
crushed
mint
leaves.
While
the
bath
was
being
prepared,
Dany
knelt
awkwardly
beside
her
lord
husband,
her
belly
great
with
their
child
within.
She
undid
his
braid
with
anxious
fingers,
as
she
had
on
the
night
he’d
taken
her
for
the
first
time,
beneath
the
stars.
His
bells
she
laid
aside
carefully,
one
by
one.
He
would
want
them
again
when
he
was
well,
she
told
herself.

A
breath
of
air
entered
the
tent
as
Aggo
poked
his
head
through
the
silk.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said,
“the
Andal
is
come,
and
begs
leave
to
enter.”

“The
Andal”
was
what
the
Dothraki
called
Ser
Jorah.
“Yes,”
she
said,
rising
clumsily,
“send
him
in.”
She
trusted
the
knight.
He
would
know
what
to
do
if
anyone
did.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
ducked
through
the
door
flap
and
waited
a
moment
for
his
eyes
to
adjust
to
the
dimness.
In
the
fierce
heat
of
the
south,
he
wore
loose
trousers
of
mottled
sandsilk
and
open-toed
riding
sandals
that
laced
up
to
his
knee.
His
scabbard
hung
from
a
twisted
horsehair
belt.
Under
a
bleached
white
vest,
he
was
bare-chested,
skin
reddened
by
the
sun.
“Talk
goes
from
mouth
to
ear,
all
over
the
khalasar,”
he
said.
“It
is
said
Khal
Drogo
fell
from
his
horse.”

“Help
him,”
Dany
pleaded.
“For
the
love
you
say
you
bear
me,
help
him
now.”

The
knight
knelt
beside
her.
He
looked
at
Drogo
long
and
hard,
and
then
at
Dany.
“Send
your
maids
away.”

Wordlessly,
her
throat
tight
with
fear,
Dany
made
a
gesture.
Irri
herded
the
other
girls
from
the
tent.

When
they
were
alone,
Ser
Jorah
drew
his
dagger.
Deftly,
with
a
delicacy
surprising
in
such
a
big
man,
he
began
to
scrape
away
the
black
leaves
and
dried
blue
mud
from
Drogo’s
chest.
The
plaster
had
caked
hard
as
the
mud
walls
of
the
Lamb
Men,
and
like
those
walls
it
cracked
easily.
Ser
Jorah
broke
the
dry
mud
with
his
knife,
pried
the
chunks
from
the
flesh,
peeled
off
the
leaves
one
by
one.
A
foul,
sweet
smell
rose
from
the
wound,
so
thick
it
almost
choked
her.
The
leaves
were
crusted
with
blood
and
pus,
Drogo’s
breast
black
and
glistening
with
corruption.

“No,”
Dany
whispered
as
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks.
“No,
please,
gods
hear
me,
no.”

Khal
Drogo
thrashed,
fighting
some
unseen
enemy.
Black
blood
ran
slow
and
thick
from
his
open
wound.

“Your
khal
is
good
as
dead,
Princess.”

“No,
he
can’t
die,
he
mustn’t,
it
was
only
a
cut.”
Dany
took
his
large
callused
hand
in
her
own
small
ones,
and
held
it
tight
between
them.
“I
will
not
let
him
die…”

Ser
Jorah
gave
a
bitter
laugh.
“Khaleesi
or
queen,
that
command
is
beyond
your
power.
Save
your
tears,
child.
Weep
for
him
tomorrow,
or
a
year
from
now.
We
do
not
have
time
for
grief.
We
must
go,
and
quickly,
before
he
dies.”

Dany
was
lost.
“Go?
Where
should
we
go?”

“Asshai,
I
would
say.
It
lies
far
to
the
south,
at
the
end
of
the
known
world,
yet
men
say
it
is
a
great
port.
We
will
find
a
ship
to
take
us
back
to
Pentos.
It
will
be
a
hard
journey,
make
no
mistake.
Do
you
trust
your
khas?
Will
they
come
with
us?”

“Khal
Drogo
commanded
them
to
keep
me
safe,”
Dany
replied
uncertainly,
“but
if
he
dies…”
She
touched
the
swell
of
her
belly.
“I
don’t
understand.
Why
should
we
flee?
I
am
khaleesi.
I
carry
Drogo’s
heir.
He
will
be
khal
after
Drogo…”

Ser
Jorah
frowned.
“Princess,
hear
me.
The
Dothraki
will
not
follow
a
suckling
babe.
Drogo’s
strength
was
what
they
bowed
to,
and
only
that.
When
he
is
gone,
Jhaqo
and
Pono
and
the
other
kos
will
fight
for
his
place,
and
this
khalasar
will
devour
itself.
The
winner
will
want
no
more
rivals.
The
boy
will
be
taken
from
your
breast
the
moment
he
is
born.
They
will
give
him
to
the
dogs…”

Dany
hugged
herself.
“But
why?”
she
cried
plaintively.
“Why
should
they
kill
a
little
baby?”

“He
is
Drogo’s
son,
and
the
crones
say
he
will
be
the
stallion
who
mounts
the
world.
It
was
prophesied.
Better
to
kill
the
child
than
to
risk
his
fury
when
he
grows
to
manhood.”

The
child
kicked
inside
her,
as
if
he
had
heard.
Dany
remembered
the
story
Viserys
had
told
her,
of
what
the
Usurper’s
dogs
had
done
to
Rhaegar’s
children.
His
son
had
been
a
babe
as
well,
yet
they
had
ripped
him
from
his
mother’s
breast
and
dashed
his
head
against
a
wall.
That
was
the
way
of
men.
“They
must
not
hurt
my
son!”
she
cried.
“I
will
order
my
khas
to
keep
him
safe,
and
Drogo’s
bloodriders
will—”

Ser
Jorah
held
her
by
the
shoulders.
“A
bloodrider
dies
with
his
khal.
You
know
that,
child.
They
will
take
you
to
Vaes
Dothrak,
to
the
crones,
that
is
the
last
duty
they
owe
him
in
life…
when
it
is
done,
they
will
join
Drogo
in
the
night
lands.”

Dany
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
Vaes
Dothrak
and
live
the
rest
of
her
life
among
those
terrible
old
women,
yet
she
knew
that
the
knight
spoke
the
truth.
Drogo
had
been
more
than
her
sun-and-stars;
he
had
been
the
shield
that
kept
her
safe.
“I
will
not
leave
him,”
she
said
stubbornly,
miserably.
She
took
his
hand
again.
“I
will
not.”

A
stirring
at
the
tent
flap
made
Dany
turn
her
head.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
entered,
bowing
low.
Days
on
the
march,
trailing
behind
the
khalasar,
had
left
her
limping
and
haggard,
with
blistered
and
bleeding
feet
and
hollows
under
her
eyes.
Behind
her
came
Qotho
and
Haggo,
carrying
the
godswife’s
chest
between
them.
When
the
bloodriders
caught
sight
of
Drogo’s
wound,
the
chest
slipped
from
Haggo’s
fingers
and
crashed
to
the
floor
of
the
tent,
and
Qotho
swore
an
oath
so
foul
it
seared
the
air.

Mirri
Maz
Duur
studied
Drogo,
her
face
still
and
dead.
“The
wound
has
festered.”

“This
is
your
work,
maegi,”
Qotho
said.
Haggo
laid
his
fist
across
Mirri’s
cheek
with
a
meaty
smack
that
drove
her
to
the
ground.
Then
he
kicked
her
where
she
lay.

“Stop
it!”
Dany
screamed.

Qotho
pulled
Haggo
away,
saying,
“Kicks
are
too
merciful
for
a
maegi.
Take
her
outside.
We
will
stake
her
to
the
earth,
to
be
the
mount
of
every
passing
man.
And
when
they
are
done
with
her,
the
dogs
will
use
her
as
well.
Weasels
will
tear
out
her
entrails
and
carrion
crows
feast
upon
her
eyes.
The
flies
off
the
river
shall
lay
their
eggs
in
her
womb
and
drink
pus
from
the
ruins
of
her
breasts…”
He
dug
iron-hard
fingers
into
the
soft,
wobbly
flesh
under
the
godswife’s
arm
and
hauled
her
to
her
feet.

“No,”
Dany
said.
“I
will
not
have
her
harmed.”

Qotho’s
lips
skinned
back
from
his
crooked
brown
teeth
in
a
terrible
mockery
of
a
smile.
“No?
You
say
me
no?
Better
you
should
pray
that
we
do
not
stake
you
out
beside
your
maegi.
You
did
this,
as
much
as
the
other.”

Ser
Jorah
stepped
between
them,
loosening
his
longsword
in
its
scabbard.
“Rein
in
your
tongue,
bloodrider.
The
princess
is
still
your
khaleesi.
“

“Only
while
the
blood-of-my-blood
still
lives,”
Qotho
told
the
knight.
“When
he
dies,
she
is
nothing.”

Dany
felt
a
tightness
inside
her.
“Before
I
was
khaleesi,
I
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
Ser
Jorah,
summon
my
khas.”

“No,”
said
Qotho.
“We
will
go.
For
now…
Khaleesi.”
Haggo
followed
him
from
the
tent,
scowling.

“That
one
means
you
no
good,
Princess,”
Mormont
said.
“The
Dothraki
say
a
man
and
his
bloodriders
share
one
life,
and
Qotho
sees
it
ending.
A
dead
man
is
beyond
fear.”

“No
one
has
died,”
Dany
said.
“Ser
Jorah,
I
may
have
need
of
your
blade.
Best
go
don
your
armor.”
She
was
more
frightened
than
she
dared
admit,
even
to
herself.

The
knight
bowed.
“As
you
say.”
He
strode
from
the
tent.

Dany
turned
back
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
The
woman’s
eyes
were
wary.
“So
you
have
saved
me
once
more.”

“And
now
you
must
save
him,”
Dany
said.
“Please…”

“You
do
not
ask
a
slave,”
Mirri
replied
sharply,
“you
tell
her.”
She
went
to
Drogo
burning
on
his
mat,
and
gazed
long
at
his
wound.
“Ask
or
tell,
it
makes
no
matter.
He
is
beyond
a
healer’s
skills.”
The
khal’s
eyes
were
closed.
She
opened
one
with
her
fingers.
“He
has
been
dulling
the
hurt
with
milk
of
the
poppy.”

“Yes,”
Dany
admitted.

“I
made
him
a
poultice
of
firepod
and
sting-me-not
and
bound
it
in
a
lambskin.”

“It
burned,
he
said.
He
tore
it
off.
The
herbwomen
made
him
a
new
one,
wet
and
soothing.”

“It
burned,
yes.
There
is
great
healing
magic
in
fire,
even
your
hairless
men
know
that.”

“Make
him
another
poultice,”
Dany
begged.
“This
time
I
will
make
certain
he
wears
it.”

“The
time
for
that
is
past,
my
lady,”
Mirri
said.
“All
I
can
do
now
is
ease
the
dark
road
before
him,
so
he
might
ride
painless
to
the
night
lands.
He
will
be
gone
by
morning.”

Her
words
were
a
knife
through
Dany’s
breast.
What
had
she
ever
done
to
make
the
gods
so
cruel?
She
had
finally
found
a
safe
place,
had
finally
tasted
love
and
hope.
She
was
finally
going
home.
And
now
to
lose
it
all…“No,”
she
pleaded.
“Save
him,
and
I
will
free
you,
I
swear
it.
You
must
know
a
way…
some
magic,
some…”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
sat
back
on
her
heels
and
studied
Daenerys
through
eyes
as
black
as
night.
“There
is
a
spell.”
Her
voice
was
quiet,
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper.
“But
it
is
hard,
lady,
and
dark.
Some
would
say
that
death
is
cleaner.
I
learned
the
way
in
Asshai,
and
paid
dear
for
the
lesson.
My
teacher
was
a
bloodmage
from
the
Shadow
Lands.”

Dany
went
cold
all
over.
“Then
you
truly
are
a
maegi…”

“Am
I?”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
smiled.
“Only
a
maegi
can
save
your
rider
now,
Silver
Lady.”

“Is
there
no
other
way?”

“No
other.”

Khal
Drogo
gave
a
shuddering
gasp.

“Do
it,”
Dany
blurted.
She
must
not
be
afraid;
she
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon.
“Save
him.”

“There
is
a
price,”
the
godswife
warned
her.

“You’ll
have
gold,
horses,
whatever
you
like.”

“It
is
not
a
matter
of
gold
or
horses.
This
is
bloodmagic,
lady.
Only
death
may
pay
for
life.”

“Death?”
Dany
wrapped
her
arms
around
herself
protectively,
rocked
back
and
forth
on
her
heels.
“My
death?”
She
told
herself
she
would
die
for
him,
if
she
must.
She
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
she
would
not
be
afraid.
Her
brother
Rhaegar
had
died
for
the
woman
he
loved.

“No,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
promised.
“Not
your
death,
Khaleesi.”

Dany
trembled
with
relief.
“Do
it.”

The
maegi
nodded
solemnly.
“As
you
speak,
so
it
shall
be
done.
Call
your
servants.”

Khal
Drogo
writhed
feebly
as
Rakharo
and
Quaro
lowered
him
into
the
bath.
“No,”
he
muttered,
“no.
Must
ride.”
Once
in
the
water,
all
the
strength
seemed
to
leak
out
of
him.

“Bring
his
horse,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
commanded,
and
so
it
was
done.
Jhogo
led
the
great
red
stallion
into
the
tent.
When
the
animal
caught
the
scent
of
death,
he
screamed
and
reared,
rolling
his
eyes.
It
took
three
men
to
subdue
him.

“What
do
you
mean
to
do?”
Dany
asked
her.

“We
need
the
blood,”
Mirri
answered.
“That
is
the
way.”

Jhogo
edged
back,
his
hand
on
his
arakh.
He
was
a
youth
of
sixteen
years,
whip-thin,
fearless,
quick
to
laugh,
with
the
faint
shadow
of
his
first
mustachio
on
his
upper
lip.
He
fell
to
his
knees
before
her.
“Khaleesi,”
he
pleaded,
“you
must
not
do
this
thing.
Let
me
kill
this
maegi.”

“Kill
her
and
you
kill
your
khal,”
Dany
said.

“This
is
bloodmagic,”
he
said.
“It
is
forbidden.”

“I
am
khaleesi,
and
I
say
it
is
not
forbidden.
In
Vaes
Dothrak,
Khal
Drogo
slew
a
stallion
and
I
ate
his
heart,
to
give
our
son
strength
and
courage.
This
is
the
same.
The
same.”

The
stallion
kicked
and
reared
as
Rakharo,
Quaro,
and
Aggo
pulled
him
close
to
the
tub
where
the
khal
floated
like
one
already
dead,
pus
and
blood
seeping
from
his
wound
to
stain
the
bathwaters.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
chanted
words
in
a
tongue
that
Dany
did
not
know,
and
a
knife
appeared
in
her
hand.
Dany
never
saw
where
it
came
from.
It
looked
old;
hammered
red
bronze,
leaf-shaped,
its
blade
covered
with
ancient
glyphs.
The
maegi
drew
it
across
the
stallion’s
throat,
under
the
noble
head,
and
the
horse
screamed
and
shuddered
as
the
blood
poured
out
of
him
in
a
red
rush.
He
would
have
collapsed,
but
the
men
of
her
khas
held
him
up.
“Strength
of
the
mount,
go
into
the
rider,”
Mirri
sang
as
horse
blood
swirled
into
the
waters
of
Drogo’s
bath.
“Strength
of
the
beast,
go
into
the
man.”

Jhogo
looked
terrified
as
he
struggled
with
the
stallion’s
weight,
afraid
to
touch
the
dead
flesh,
yet
afraid
to
let
go
as
well.
Only
a
horse,
Dany
thought.
If
she
could
buy
Drogo’s
life
with
the
death
of
a
horse,
she
would
pay
a
thousand
times
over.

When
they
let
the
stallion
fall,
the
bath
was
a
dark
red,
and
nothing
showed
of
Drogo
but
his
face.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
no
use
for
the
carcass.
“Burn
it,”
Dany
told
them.
It
was
what
they
did,
she
knew.
When
a
man
died,
his
mount
was
killed
and
placed
beneath
him
on
the
funeral
pyre,
to
carry
him
to
the
night
lands.
The
men
of
her
khas
dragged
the
carcass
from
the
tent.
The
blood
had
gone
everywhere.
Even
the
sandsilk
walls
were
spotted
with
red,
and
the
rugs
underfoot
were
black
and
wet.

Braziers
were
lit.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
tossed
a
red
powder
onto
the
coals.
It
gave
the
smoke
a
spicy
scent,
a
pleasant
enough
smell,
yet
Eroeh
fled
sobbing,
and
Dany
was
filled
with
fear.
But
she
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
now.
She
sent
her
handmaids
away.
“Go
with
them,
Silver
Lady,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
told
her.

“I
will
stay,”
Dany
said.
“The
man
took
me
under
the
stars
and
gave
life
to
the
child
inside
me.
I
will
not
leave
him.”

“You
must.
Once
I
begin
to
sing,
no
one
must
enter
this
tent.
My
song
will
wake
powers
old
and
dark.
The
dead
will
dance
here
this
night.
No
living
man
must
look
on
them.”

Dany
bowed
her
head,
helpless.
“No
one
will
enter.”
She
bent
over
the
tub,
over
Drogo
in
his
bath
of
blood,
and
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
brow.
“Bring
him
back
to
me,”
she
whispered
to
Mirri
Maz
Duur
before
she
fled.

Outside,
the
sun
was
low
on
the
horizon,
the
sky
a
bruised
red.
The
khalasar
had
made
camp.
Tents
and
sleeping
mats
were
scattered
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see.
A
hot
wind
blew.
Jhogo
and
Aggo
were
digging
a
firepit
to
burn
the
dead
stallion.
A
crowd
had
gathered
to
stare
at
Dany
with
hard
black
eyes,
their
faces
like
masks
of
beaten
copper.
She
saw
Ser
Jorah
Mormont,
wearing
mail
and
leather
now,
sweat
beading
on
his
broad,
balding
forehead.
He
pushed
his
way
through
the
Dothraki
to
Dany’s
side.
When
he
saw
the
scarlet
footprints
her
boots
had
left
on
the
ground,
the
color
seemed
to
drain
from
his
face.
“What
have
you
done,
you
little
fool?”
he
asked
hoarsely.

“I
had
to
save
him.”

“We
could
have
fled,”
he
said.
“I
would
have
seen
you
safe
to
Asshai,
Princess.
There
was
no
need…”

“Am
I
truly
your
princess?”
she
asked
him.

“You
know
you
are,
gods
save
us
both.”

“Then
help
me
now.”

Ser
Jorah
grimaced.
“Would
that
I
knew
how.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
rose
to
a
high,
ululating
wail
that
sent
a
shiver
down
Dany’s
back.
Some
of
the
Dothraki
began
to
mutter
and
back
away.
The
tent
was
aglow
with
the
light
of
braziers
within.
Through
the
blood-spattered
sandsilk,
she
glimpsed
shadows
moving.

Mirri
Maz
Duur
was
dancing,
and
not
alone.

Dany
saw
naked
fear
on
the
faces
of
the
Dothraki.
“This
must
not
be,”
Qotho
thundered.

She
had
not
seen
the
bloodrider
return.
Haggo
and
Cohollo
were
with
him.
They
had
brought
the
hairless
men,
the
eunuchs
who
healed
with
knife
and
needle
and
fire.

“This
will
be,”
Dany
replied.

“Maegi,”
Haggo
growled.
And
old
Cohollo—Cohollo
who
had
bound
his
life
to
Drogo’s
on
the
day
of
his
birth,
Cohollo
who
had
always
been
kind
to
her—Cohollo
spat
full
in
her
face.

“You
will
die,
maegi,”
Qotho
promised,
“but
the
other
must
die
first.”
He
drew
his
arakh
and
made
for
the
tent.

“No,”
she
shouted,
“you
mustn’t.”
She
caught
him
by
the
shoulder,
but
Qotho
shoved
her
aside.
Dany
fell
to
her
knees,
crossing
her
arms
over
her
belly
to
protect
the
child
within.
“Stop
him,”
she
commanded
her
khas,
“kill
him.”

Rakharo
and
Quaro
stood
beside
the
tent
flap.
Quaro
took
a
step
forward,
reaching
for
the
handle
of
his
whip,
but
Qotho
spun
graceful
as
a
dancer,
the
curved
arakh
rising.
It
caught
Quaro
low
under
the
arm,
the
bright
sharp
steel
biting
up
through
leather
and
skin,
through
muscle
and
rib
bone.
Blood
fountained
as
the
young
rider
reeled
backward,
gasping.

Qotho
wrenched
the
blade
free.
“Horselord,”
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
called.
“Try
me.”
His
longsword
slid
from
its
scabbard.

Qotho
whirled,
cursing.
The
arakh
moved
so
fast
that
Quaro’s
blood
flew
from
it
in
a
fine
spray,
like
rain
in
a
hot
wind.
The
longsword
caught
it
a
foot
from
Ser
Jorah’s
face,
and
held
it
quivering
for
an
instant
as
Qotho
howled
in
fury.
The
knight
was
clad
in
chainmail,
with
gauntlets
and
greaves
of
lobstered
steel
and
a
heavy
gorget
around
his
throat,
but
he
had
not
thought
to
don
his
helm.

Qotho
danced
backward,
arakh
whirling
around
his
head
in
a
shining
blur,
flickering
out
like
lightning
as
the
knight
came
on
in
a
rush.
Ser
Jorah
parried
as
best
he
could,
but
the
slashes
came
so
fast
that
it
seemed
to
Dany
that
Qotho
had
four
arakhs
and
as
many
arms.
She
heard
the
crunch
of
sword
on
mail,
saw
sparks
fly
as
the
long
curved
blade
glanced
off
a
gauntlet.
Suddenly
it
was
Mormont
stumbling
backward,
and
Qotho
leaping
to
the
attack.
The
left
side
of
the
knight’s
face
ran
red
with
blood,
and
a
cut
to
the
hip
opened
a
gash
in
his
mail
and
left
him
limping.
Qotho
screamed
taunts
at
him,
calling
him
a
craven,
a
milk
man,
a
eunuch
in
an
iron
suit.
“You
die
now!”
he
promised,
arakh
shivering
through
the
red
twilight.
Inside
Dany’s
womb,
her
son
kicked
wildly.
The
curved
blade
slipped
past
the
straight
one
and
bit
deep
into
the
knight’s
hip
where
the
mail
gaped
open.

Mormont
grunted,
stumbled.
Dany
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
her
belly,
a
wetness
on
her
thighs.
Qotho
shrieked
triumph,
but
his
arakh
had
found
bone,
and
for
half
a
heartbeat
it
caught.

It
was
enough.
Ser
Jorah
brought
his
longsword
down
with
all
the
strength
left
him,
through
flesh
and
muscle
and
bone,
and
Qotho’s
forearm
dangled
loose,
flopping
on
a
thin
cord
of
skin
and
sinew.
The
knight’s
next
cut
was
at
the
Dothraki’s
ear,
so
savage
that
Qotho’s
face
seemed
almost
to
explode.

The
Dothraki
were
shouting,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
wailing
inside
the
tent
like
nothing
human,
Quaro
pleading
for
water
as
he
died.
Dany
cried
out
for
help,
but
no
one
heard.
Rakharo
was
fighting
Haggo,
arakh
dancing
with
arakh
until
Jhogo’s
whip
cracked,
loud
as
thunder,
the
lash
coiling
around
Haggo’s
throat.
A
yank,
and
the
bloodrider
stumbled
backward,
losing
his
feet
and
his
sword.
Rakharo
sprang
forward,
howling,
swinging
his
arakh
down
with
both
hands
through
the
top
of
Haggo’s
head.
The
point
caught
between
his
eyes,
red
and
quivering.
Someone
threw
a
stone,
and
when
Dany
looked,
her
shoulder
was
torn
and
bloody.
“No,”
she
wept,
“no,
please,
stop
it,
it’s
too
high,
the
price
is
too
high.”
More
stones
came
flying.
She
tried
to
crawl
toward
the
tent,
but
Cohollo
caught
her.
Fingers
in
her
hair,
he
pulled
her
head
back
and
she
felt
the
cold
touch
of
his
knife
at
her
throat.
“My
baby,”
she
screamed,
and
perhaps
the
gods
heard,
for
as
quick
as
that,
Cohollo
was
dead.
Aggo’s
arrow
took
him
under
the
arm,
to
pierce
his
lungs
and
heart.

When
at
last
Daenerys
found
the
strength
to
raise
her
head,
she
saw
the
crowd
dispersing,
the
Dothraki
stealing
silently
back
to
their
tents
and
sleeping
mats.
Some
were
saddling
horses
and
riding
off.
The
sun
had
set.
Fires
burned
throughout
the
khalasar,
great
orange
blazes
that
crackled
with
fury
and
spit
embers
at
the
sky.
She
tried
to
rise,
and
agony
seized
her
and
squeezed
her
like
a
giant’s
fist.
The
breath
went
out
of
her;
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
gasp.
The
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
was
like
a
funeral
dirge.
Inside
the
tent,
the
shadows
whirled.

An
arm
went
under
her
waist,
and
then
Ser
Jorah
was
lifting
her
off
her
feet.
His
face
was
sticky
with
blood,
and
Dany
saw
that
half
his
ear
was
gone.
She
convulsed
in
his
arms
as
the
pain
took
her
again,
and
heard
the
knight
shouting
for
her
handmaids
to
help
him.
Are
they
all
so
afraid?
She
knew
the
answer.
Another
pain
grasped
her,
and
Dany
bit
back
a
scream.
It
felt
as
if
her
son
had
a
knife
in
each
hand,
as
if
he
were
hacking
at
her
to
cut
his
way
out.
“Doreah,
curse
you,”
Ser
Jorah
roared.
“Come
here.
Fetch
the
birthing
women.”

“They
will
not
come.
They
say
she
is
accursed.”

“They’ll
come
or
I’ll
have
their
heads.”

Doreah
wept.
“They
are
gone,
my
lord.”

“The
maegi,”
someone
else
said.
Was
that
Aggo?
“Take
her
to
the
maegi.”

No,
Dany
wanted
to
say,
no,
not
that,
you
mustn’t,
but
when
she
opened
her
mouth,
a
long
wail
of
pain
escaped,
and
the
sweat
broke
over
her
skin.
What
was
wrong
with
them,
couldn’t
they
see?
Inside
the
tent
the
shapes
were
dancing,
circling
the
brazier
and
the
bloody
bath,
dark
against
the
sandsilk,
and
some
did
not
look
human.
She
glimpsed
the
shadow
of
a
great
wolf,
and
another
like
a
man
wreathed
in
flames.

“The
Lamb
Woman
knows
the
secrets
of
the
birthing
bed,”
Irri
said.
“She
said
so,
I
heard
her.”

“Yes,”
Doreah
agreed,
“I
heard
her
too.”

No,
she
shouted,
or
perhaps
she
only
thought
it,
for
no
whisper
of
sound
escaped
her
lips.
She
was
being
carried.
Her
eyes
opened
to
gaze
up
at
a
flat
dead
sky,
black
and
bleak
and
starless.
Please,
no.
The
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
voice
grew
louder,
until
it
filled
the
world.
The
shapes!
she
screamed.
The
dancers!

Ser
Jorah
carried
her
inside
the
tent.





ARYA

The
scent
of
hot
bread
drifting
from
the
shops
along
the
Street
of
Flour
was
sweeter
than
any
perfume
Arya
had
ever
smelled.
She
took
a
deep
breath
and
stepped
closer
to
the
pigeon.
It
was
a
plump
one,
speckled
brown,
busily
pecking
at
a
crust
that
had
fallen
between
two
cobblestones,
but
when
Arya’s
shadow
touched
it,
it
took
to
the
air.

Her
stick
sword
whistled
out
and
caught
it
two
feet
off
the
ground,
and
it
went
down
in
a
flurry
of
brown
feathers.
She
was
on
it
in
the
blink
of
an
eye,
grabbing
a
wing
as
the
pigeon
flapped
and
fluttered.
It
pecked
at
her
hand.
She
grabbed
its
neck
and
twisted
until
she
felt
the
bone
snap.

Compared
with
catching
cats,
pigeons
were
easy.

A
passing
septon
was
looking
at
her
askance.
“Here’s
the
best
place
to
find
pigeon,”
Arya
told
him
as
she
brushed
herself
off
and
picked
up
her
fallen
stick
sword.
“They
come
for
the
crumbs.”
He
hurried
away.

She
tied
the
pigeon
to
her
belt
and
started
down
the
street.
A
man
was
pushing
a
load
of
tarts
by
on
a
two-wheeled
cart;
the
smells
sang
of
blueberries
and
lemons
and
apricots.
Her
stomach
made
a
hollow
rumbly
noise.
“Could
I
have
one?”
she
heard
herself
say.
“A
lemon,
or…
or
any
kind.”

The
pushcart
man
looked
her
up
and
down.
Plainly
he
did
not
like
what
he
saw.
“Three
coppers.”

Arya
tapped
her
wooden
sword
against
the
side
of
her
boot.
“I’ll
trade
you
a
fat
pigeon,”
she
said.

“The
Others
take
your
pigeon,”
the
pushcart
man
said.

The
tarts
were
still
warm
from
the
oven.
The
smells
were
making
her
mouth
water,
but
she
did
not
have
three
coppers…
or
one.
She
gave
the
pushcart
man
a
look,
remembering
what
Syrio
had
told
her
about
seeing.
He
was
short,
with
a
little
round
belly,
and
when
he
moved
he
seemed
to
favor
his
left
leg
a
little.
She
was
just
thinking
that
if
she
snatched
a
tart
and
ran
he
would
never
be
able
to
catch
her
when
he
said,
“You
be
keepin’
your
filthy
hands
off.
The
gold
cloaks
know
how
to
deal
with
thieving
little
gutter
rats,
that
they
do.”

Arya
glanced
warily
behind
her.
Two
of
the
City
Watch
were
standing
at
the
mouth
of
an
alley.
Their
cloaks
hung
almost
to
the
ground,
the
heavy
wool
dyed
a
rich
gold;
their
mail
and
boots
and
gloves
were
black.
One
wore
a
longsword
at
his
hip,
the
other
an
iron
cudgel.
With
a
last
wistful
glance
at
the
tarts,
Arya
edged
back
from
the
cart
and
hurried
off.
The
gold
cloaks
had
not
been
paying
her
any
special
attention,
but
the
sight
of
them
tied
her
stomach
in
knots.
Arya
had
been
staying
as
far
from
the
castle
as
she
could
get,
yet
even
from
a
distance
she
could
see
the
heads
rotting
atop
the
high
red
walls.
Flocks
of
crows
squabbled
noisily
over
each
head,
thick
as
flies.
The
talk
in
Flea
Bottom
was
that
the
gold
cloaks
had
thrown
in
with
the
Lannisters,
their
commander
raised
to
a
lord,
with
lands
on
the
Trident
and
a
seat
on
the
king’s
council.

She
had
also
heard
other
things,
scary
things,
things
that
made
no
sense
to
her.
Some
said
her
father
had
murdered
King
Robert
and
been
slain
in
turn
by
Lord
Renly.
Others
insisted
that
Renly
had
killed
the
king
in
a
drunken
quarrel
between
brothers.
Why
else
should
he
have
fled
in
the
night
like
a
common
thief?
One
story
said
the
king
had
been
killed
by
a
boar
while
hunting,
another
that
he’d
died
eating
a
boar,
stuffing
himself
so
full
that
he’d
ruptured
at
the
table.
No,
the
king
had
died
at
table,
others
said,
but
only
because
Varys
the
Spider
poisoned
him.
No,
it
had
been
the
queen
who
poisoned
him.
No,
he
had
died
of
a
pox.
No,
he
had
choked
on
a
fish
bone.

One
thing
all
the
stories
agreed
on:
King
Robert
was
dead.
The
bells
in
the
seven
towers
of
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
had
tolled
for
a
day
and
a
night,
the
thunder
of
their
grief
rolling
across
the
city
in
a
bronze
tide.
They
only
rang
the
bells
like
that
for
the
death
of
a
king,
a
tanner’s
boy
told
Arya.

All
she
wanted
was
to
go
home,
but
leaving
King’s
Landing
was
not
so
easy
as
she
had
hoped.
Talk
of
war
was
on
every
lip,
and
gold
cloaks
were
as
thick
on
the
city
walls
as
fleas
on…
well,
her,
for
one.
She
had
been
sleeping
in
Flea
Bottom,
on
rooftops
and
in
stables,
wherever
she
could
find
a
place
to
lie
down,
and
it
hadn’t
taken
her
long
to
learn
that
the
district
was
well
named.

Every
day
since
her
escape
from
the
Red
Keep,
Arya
had
visited
each
of
the
seven
city
gates
in
turn.
The
Dragon
Gate,
the
Lion
Gate,
and
the
Old
Gate
were
closed
and
barred.
The
Mud
Gate
and
the
Gate
of
the
Gods
were
open,
but
only
to
those
who
wanted
to
enter
the
city;
the
guards
let
no
one
out.
Those
who
were
allowed
to
leave
left
by
the
King’s
Gate
or
the
Iron
Gate,
but
Lannister
men-at-arms
in
crimson
cloaks
and
lion-crested
helms
manned
the
guard
posts
there.
Spying
down
from
the
roof
of
an
inn
by
the
King’s
Gate,
Arya
saw
them
searching
wagons
and
carriages,
forcing
riders
to
open
their
saddlebags,
and
questioning
everyone
who
tried
to
pass
on
foot.

Sometimes
she
thought
about
swimming
the
river,
but
the
Blackwater
Rush
was
wide
and
deep,
and
everyone
agreed
that
its
currents
were
wicked
and
treacherous.
She
had
no
coin
to
pay
a
ferryman
or
take
passage
on
a
ship.

Her
lord
father
had
taught
her
never
to
steal,
but
it
was
growing
harder
to
remember
why.
If
she
did
not
get
out
soon,
she
would
have
to
take
her
chances
with
the
gold
cloaks.
She
hadn’t
gone
hungry
much
since
she
learned
to
knock
down
birds
with
her
stick
sword,
but
she
feared
so
much
pigeon
was
making
her
sick.
A
couple
she’d
eaten
raw,
before
she
found
Flea
Bottom.

In
the
Bottom
there
were
pot-shops
along
the
alleys
where
huge
tubs
of
stew
had
been
simmering
for
years,
and
you
could
trade
half
your
bird
for
a
heel
of
yesterday’s
bread
and
a
“bowl
o’
brown,”
and
they’d
even
stick
the
other
half
in
the
fire
and
crisp
it
up
for
you,
so
long
as
you
plucked
the
feathers
yourself.
Arya
would
have
given
anything
for
a
cup
of
milk
and
a
lemon
cake,
but
the
brown
wasn’t
so
bad.
It
usually
had
barley
in
it,
and
chunks
of
carrot
and
onion
and
turnip,
and
sometimes
even
apple,
with
a
film
of
grease
swimming
on
top.
Mostly
she
tried
not
to
think
about
the
meat.
Once
she
had
gotten
a
piece
of
fish.

The
only
thing
was,
the
pot-shops
were
never
empty,
and
even
as
she
bolted
down
her
food,
Arya
could
feel
them
watching.
Some
of
them
stared
at
her
boots
or
her
cloak,
and
she
knew
what
they
were
thinking.
With
others,
she
could
almost
feel
their
eyes
crawling
under
her
leathers;
she
didn’t
know
what
they
were
thinking,
and
that
scared
her
even
more.
A
couple
times,
she
was
followed
out
into
the
alleys
and
chased,
but
so
far
no
one
had
been
able
to
catch
her.

The
silver
bracelet
she’d
hoped
to
sell
had
been
stolen
her
first
night
out
of
the
castle,
along
with
her
bundle
of
good
clothes,
snatched
while
she
slept
in
a
burnt-out
house
off
Pig
Alley.
All
they
left
her
was
the
cloak
she
had
been
huddled
in,
the
leathers
on
her
back,
her
wooden
practice
sword…
and
Needle.
She’d
been
lying
on
top
of
Needle,
or
else
it
would
have
been
gone
too;
it
was
worth
more
than
all
the
rest
together.
Since
then
Arya
had
taken
to
walking
around
with
her
cloak
draped
over
her
right
arm,
to
conceal
the
blade
at
her
hip.
The
wooden
sword
she
carried
in
her
left
hand,
out
where
everybody
could
see
it,
to
scare
off
robbers,
but
there
were
men
in
the
pot-shops
who
wouldn’t
have
been
scared
off
if
she’d
had
a
battle-axe.
It
was
enough
to
make
her
lose
her
taste
for
pigeon
and
stale
bread.
Often
as
not,
she
went
to
bed
hungry
rather
than
risk
the
stares.

Once
she
was
outside
the
city,
she
would
find
berries
to
pick,
or
orchards
she
might
raid
for
apples
and
cherries.
Arya
remembered
seeing
some
from
the
kingsroad
on
the
journey
south.
And
she
could
dig
for
roots
in
the
forest,
even
run
down
some
rabbits.
In
the
city,
the
only
things
to
run
down
were
rats
and
cats
and
scrawny
dogs.
The
potshops
would
give
you
a
fistful
of
coppers
for
a
litter
of
pups,
she’d
heard,
but
she
didn’t
like
to
think
about
that.

Down
below
the
Street
of
Flour
was
a
maze
of
twisting
alleys
and
cross
streets.
Arya
scrambled
through
the
crowds,
trying
to
put
distance
between
her
and
the
gold
cloaks.
She
had
learned
to
keep
to
the
center
of
the
street.
Sometimes
she
had
to
dodge
wagons
and
horses,
but
at
least
you
could
see
them
coming.
If
you
walked
near
the
buildings,
people
grabbed
you.
In
some
alleys
you
couldn’t
help
but
brush
against
the
walls;
the
buildings
leaned
in
so
close
they
almost
met.

A
whooping
gang
of
small
children
went
running
past,
chasing
a
rolling
hoop.
Arya
stared
at
them
with
resentment,
remembering
the
times
she’d
played
at
hoops
with
Bran
and
Jon
and
their
baby
brother
Rickon.
She
wondered
how
big
Rickon
had
grown,
and
whether
Bran
was
sad.
She
would
have
given
anything
if
Jon
had
been
here
to
call
her
“little
sister”
and
muss
her
hair.
Not
that
it
needed
mussing.
She’d
seen
her
reflection
in
puddles,
and
she
didn’t
think
hair
got
any
more
mussed
than
hers.

She
had
tried
talking
to
the
children
she
saw
in
the
street,
hoping
to
make
a
friend
who
would
give
her
a
place
to
sleep,
but
she
must
have
talked
wrong
or
something.
The
little
ones
only
looked
at
her
with
quick,
wary
eyes
and
ran
away
if
she
came
too
close.
Their
big
brothers
and
sisters
asked
questions
Arya
couldn’t
answer,
called
her
names,
and
tried
to
steal
from
her.
Only
yesterday,
a
scrawny
barefoot
girl
twice
her
age
had
knocked
her
down
and
tried
to
pull
the
boots
off
her
feet,
but
Arya
gave
her
a
crack
on
her
ear
with
her
stick
sword
that
sent
her
off
sobbing
and
bleeding.

A
gull
wheeled
overhead
as
she
made
her
way
down
the
hill
toward
Flea
Bottom.
Arya
glanced
at
it
thoughtfully,
but
it
was
well
beyond
the
reach
of
her
stick.
It
made
her
think
of
the
sea.
Maybe
that
was
the
way
out.
Old
Nan
used
to
tell
stories
of
boys
who
stowed
away
on
trading
galleys
and
sailed
off
into
all
kinds
of
adventures.
Maybe
Arya
could
do
that
too.
She
decided
to
visit
the
riverfront.
It
was
on
the
way
to
the
Mud
Gate
anyway,
and
she
hadn’t
checked
that
one
today.

The
wharfs
were
oddly
quiet
when
Arya
got
there.
She
spied
another
pair
of
gold
cloaks,
walking
side
by
side
through
the
fish
market,
but
they
never
so
much
as
looked
at
her.
Half
the
stalls
were
empty,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
were
fewer
ships
at
dock
than
she
remembered.
Out
on
the
Blackwater,
three
of
the
king’s
war
galleys
moved
in
formation,
gold-painted
hulls
splitting
the
water
as
their
oars
rose
and
fell.
Arya
watched
them
for
a
bit,
then
began
to
make
her
way
along
the
river.

When
she
saw
the
guardsmen
on
the
third
pier,
in
grey
woolen
cloaks
trimmed
with
white
satin,
her
heart
almost
stopped
in
her
chest.
The
sight
of
Winterfell’s
colors
brought
tears
to
her
eyes.
Behind
them,
a
sleek
three-banked
trading
galley
rocked
at
her
moorings.
Arya
could
not
read
the
name
painted
on
the
hull;
the
words
were
strange,
Myrish,
Braavosi,
perhaps
even
High
Valyrian.
She
grabbed
a
passing
longshoreman
by
the
sleeve.
“Please,”
she
said,
“what
ship
is
this?”

“She’s
the
Wind
Witch,
out
of
Myr,”
the
man
said.

“She’s
still
here,”
Arya
blurted.
The
longshoreman
gave
her
a
queer
look,
shrugged,
and
walked
away.
Arya
ran
toward
the
pier.
The
Wind
Witch
was
the
ship
Father
had
hired
to
take
her
home…
still
waiting!
She’d
imagined
it
had
sailed
ages
ago.

Two
of
the
guardsmen
were
dicing
together
while
the
third
walked
rounds,
his
hand
on
the
pommel
of
his
sword.
Ashamed
to
let
them
see
her
crying
like
a
baby,
she
stopped
to
rub
at
her
eyes.
Her
eyes
her
eyes
her
eyes,
why
did…

Look
with
your
eyes,
she
heard
Syrio
whisper.

Arya
looked.
She
knew
all
of
her
father’s
men.
The
three
in
the
grey
cloaks
were
strangers.
“You,”
the
one
walking
rounds
called
out.
“What
do
you
want
here,
boy?”
The
other
two
looked
up
from
their
dice.

It
was
all
Arya
could
do
not
to
bolt
and
run,
but
she
knew
that
if
she
did,
they
would
be
after
her
at
once.
She
made
herself
walk
closer.
They
were
looking
for
a
girl,
but
he
thought
she
was
a
boy.
She’d
be
a
boy,
then.
“Want
to
buy
a
pigeon?”
She
showed
him
the
dead
bird.

“Get
out
of
here,”
the
guardsman
said.

Arya
did
as
he
told
her.
She
did
not
have
to
pretend
to
be
frightened.
Behind
her,
the
men
went
back
to
their
dice.

She
could
not
have
said
how
she
got
back
to
Flea
Bottom,
but
she
was
breathing
hard
by
the
time
she
reached
the
narrow
crooked
unpaved
streets
between
the
hills.
The
Bottom
had
a
stench
to
it,
a
stink
of
pigsties
and
stables
and
tanner’s
sheds,
mixed
in
with
the
sour
smell
of
winesinks
and
cheap
whorehouses.
Arya
wound
her
way
through
the
maze
dully.
It
was
not
until
she
caught
a
whiff
of
bubbling
brown
coming
through
a
pot-shop
door
that
she
realized
her
pigeon
was
gone.
It
must
have
slipped
from
her
belt
as
she
ran,
or
someone
had
stolen
it
and
she’d
never
noticed.
For
a
moment
she
wanted
to
cry
again.
She’d
have
to
walk
all
the
way
back
to
the
Street
of
Flour
to
find
another
one
that
plump.

Far
across
the
city,
bells
began
to
ring.

Arya
glanced
up,
listening,
wondering
what
the
ringing
meant
this
time.

“What’s
this
now?”
a
fat
man
called
from
the
pot-shop.

“The
bells
again,
gods
ha’mercy,”
wailed
an
old
woman.

A
red-haired
whore
in
a
wisp
of
painted
silk
pushed
open
a
second-story
window.
“Is
it
the
boy
king
that’s
died
now?”
she
shouted
down,
leaning
out
over
the
street.
“Ah,
that’s
a
boy
for
you,
they
never
last
long.”
As
she
laughed,
a
naked
man
slid
his
arms
around
her
from
behind,
biting
her
neck
and
rubbing
the
heavy
white
breasts
that
hung
loose
beneath
her
shift.

“Stupid
slut,”
the
fat
man
shouted
up.
“The
king’s
not
dead,
that’s
only
summoning
bells.
One
tower
tolling.
When
the
king
dies,
they
ring
every
bell
in
the
city.”

“Here,
quit
your
biting,
or
I’ll
ring
your
bells,”
the
woman
in
the
window
said
to
the
man
behind
her,
pushing
him
off
with
an
elbow.
“So
who
is
it
died,
if
not
the
king?”

“It’s
a
summoning,”
the
fat
man
repeated.

Two
boys
close
to
Arya’s
age
scampered
past,
splashing
through
a
puddle.
The
old
woman
cursed
them,
but
they
kept
right
on
going.
Other
people
were
moving
too,
heading
up
the
hill
to
see
what
the
noise
was
about.
Arya
ran
after
the
slower
boy.
“Where
you
going?”
she
shouted
when
she
was
right
behind
him.
“What’s
happening?”

He
glanced
back
without
slowing.
“The
gold
cloaks
is
carryin’
him
to
the
sept.”

“Who?”
she
yelled,
running
hard.

“The
Hand!
They’ll
be
taking
his
head
off,
Buu
says.”

A
passing
wagon
had
left
a
deep
rut
in
the
street.
The
boy
leapt
over,
but
Arya
never
saw
it.
She
tripped
and
fell,
face
first,
scraping
her
knee
open
on
a
stone
and
smashing
her
fingers
when
her
hands
hit
the
hard-packed
earth.
Needle
tangled
between
her
legs.
She
sobbed
as
she
struggled
to
her
knees.
The
thumb
of
her
left
hand
was
covered
with
blood.
When
she
sucked
on
it,
she
saw
that
half
the
thumbnail
was
gone,
ripped
off
in
her
fall.
Her
hands
throbbed,
and
her
knee
was
all
bloody
too.

“Make
way!”
someone
shouted
from
the
cross
street.
“Make
way
for
my
lords
of
Redwyne!”
It
was
all
Arya
could
do
to
get
out
of
the
road
before
they
ran
her
down,
four
guardsmen
on
huge
horses,
pounding
past
at
a
gallop.
They
wore
checked
cloaks,
blue-and-burgundy.
Behind
them,
two
young
lordlings
rode
side
by
side
on
a
pair
of
chestnut
mares
alike
as
peas
in
a
pod.
Arya
had
seen
them
in
the
bailey
a
hundred
times;
the
Redwyne
twins,
Ser
Horas
and
Ser
Hobber,
homely
youths
with
orange
hair
and
square,
freckled
faces.
Sansa
and
Jeyne
Poole
used
to
call
them
Ser
Horror
and
Ser
Slobber,
and
giggle
whenever
they
caught
sight
of
them.
They
did
not
look
funny
now.

Everyone
was
moving
in
the
same
direction,
all
in
a
hurry
to
see
what
the
ringing
was
all
about.
The
bells
seemed
louder
now,
clanging,
calling.
Arya
joined
the
stream
of
people.
Her
thumb
hurt
so
bad
where
the
nail
had
broken
that
it
was
all
she
could
do
not
to
cry.
She
bit
her
lip
as
she
limped
along,
listening
to
the
excited
voices
around
her.

“—the
King’s
Hand,
Lord
Stark.
They’re
carrying
him
up
to
Baelor’s
Sept.”

“I
heard
he
was
dead.”

“Soon
enough,
soon
enough.
Here,
I
got
me
a
silver
stag
says
they
lop
his
head
off.”

“Past
time,
the
traitor.”
The
man
spat.

Arya
struggled
to
find
a
voice.
“He
never—”
she
started,
but
she
was
only
a
child
and
they
talked
right
over
her.

“Fool!
They
ain’t
neither
going
to
lop
him.
Since
when
do
they
knick
traitors
on
the
steps
of
the
Great
Sept?”

“Well,
they
don’t
mean
to
anoint
him
no
knight.
I
heard
it
was
Stark
killed
old
King
Robert.
Slit
his
throat
in
the
woods,
and
when
they
found
him,
he
stood
there
cool
as
you
please
and
said
it
was
some
old
boar
did
for
His
Grace.”

“Ah,
that’s
not
true,
it
was
his
own
brother
did
him,
that
Renly,
him
with
his
gold
antlers.”

“You
shut
your
lying
mouth,
woman.
You
don’t
know
what
you’re
saying,
his
lordship’s
a
fine
true
man.”

By
the
time
they
reached
the
Street
of
the
Sisters,
they
were
packed
in
shoulder
to
shoulder.
Arya
let
the
human
current
carry
her
along,
up
to
the
top
of
Visenya’s
Hill.
The
white
marble
plaza
was
a
solid
mass
of
people,
all
yammering
excitedly
at
each
other
and
straining
to
get
closer
to
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor.
The
bells
were
very
loud
here.

Arya
squirmed
through
the
press,
ducking
between
the
legs
of
horses
and
clutching
tight
to
her
sword
stick.
From
the
middle
of
the
crowd,
all
she
could
see
were
arms
and
legs
and
stomachs,
and
the
seven
slender
towers
of
the
sept
looming
overhead.
She
spotted
a
wood
wagon
and
thought
to
climb
up
on
the
back
where
she
might
be
able
to
see,
but
others
had
the
same
idea.
The
teamster
cursed
at
them
and
drove
them
off
with
a
crack
of
his
whip.

Arya
grew
frantic.
Forcing
her
way
to
the
front
of
the
crowd,
she
was
shoved
up
against
the
stone
of
a
plinth.
She
looked
up
at
Baelor
the
Blessed,
the
septon
king.
Sliding
her
stick
sword
through
her
belt,
Arya
began
to
climb.
Her
broken
thumbnail
left
smears
of
blood
on
the
painted
marble,
but
she
made
it
up,
and
wedged
herself
in
between
the
king’s
feet.

That
was
when
she
saw
her
father.

Lord
Eddard
stood
on
the
High
Septon’s
pulpit
outside
the
doors
of
the
sept,
supported
between
two
of
the
gold
cloaks.
He
was
dressed
in
a
rich
grey
velvet
doublet
with
a
white
wolf
sewn
on
the
front
in
beads,
and
a
grey
wool
cloak
trimmed
with
fur,
but
he
was
thinner
than
Arya
had
ever
seen
him,
his
long
face
drawn
with
pain.
He
was
not
standing
so
much
as
being
held
up;
the
cast
over
his
broken
leg
was
grey
and
rotten.

The
High
Septon
himself
stood
behind
him,
a
squat
man,
grey
with
age
and
ponderously
fat,
wearing
long
white
robes
and
an
immense
crown
of
spun
gold
and
crystal
that
wreathed
his
head
with
rainbows
whenever
he
moved.

Clustered
around
the
doors
of
the
sept,
in
front
of
the
raised
marble
pulpit,
were
a
knot
of
knights
and
high
lords.
Joffrey
was
prominent
among
them,
his
raiment
all
crimson,
silk
and
satin
patterned
with
prancing
stags
and
roaring
lions,
a
gold
crown
on
his
head.
His
queen
mother
stood
beside
him
in
a
black
mourning
gown
slashed
with
crimson,
a
veil
of
black
diamonds
in
her
hair.
Arya
recognized
the
Hound,
wearing
a
snowy
white
cloak
over
his
dark
grey
armor,
with
four
of
the
Kingsguard
around
him.
She
saw
Varys
the
eunuch
gliding
among
the
lords
in
soft
slippers
and
a
patterned
damask
robe,
and
she
thought
the
short
man
with
the
silvery
cape
and
pointed
beard
might
be
the
one
who
had
once
fought
a
duel
for
Mother.

And
there
in
their
midst
was
Sansa,
dressed
in
sky-blue
silk,
with
her
long
auburn
hair
washed
and
curled
and
silver
bracelets
on
her
wrists.
Arya
scowled,
wondering
what
her
sister
was
doing
here,
why
she
looked
so
happy.

A
long
line
of
gold-cloaked
spearmen
held
back
the
crowd,
commanded
by
a
stout
man
in
elaborate
armor,
all
black
lacquer
and
gold
filigree.
His
cloak
had
the
metallic
shimmer
of
true
cloth-of-gold.

When
the
bell
ceased
to
toll,
a
quiet
slowly
settled
across
the
great
plaza,
and
her
father
lifted
his
head
and
began
to
speak,
his
voice
so
thin
and
weak
she
could
scarcely
make
him
out.
People
behind
her
began
to
shout
out,
“What?”
and
“Louder!”
The
man
in
the
black-and-gold
armor
stepped
up
behind
Father
and
prodded
him
sharply.
You
leave
him
alone!
Arya
wanted
to
shout,
but
she
knew
no
one
would
listen.
She
chewed
her
lip.

Her
father
raised
his
voice
and
began
again.
“I
am
Eddard
Stark,
Lord
of
Winterfell
and
Hand
of
the
King,”
he
said
more
loudly,
his
voice
carrying
across
the
plaza,
“and
I
come
before
you
to
confess
my
treason
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men.”

“No,”
Arya
whimpered.
Below
her,
the
crowd
began
to
scream
and
shout.
Taunts
and
obscenities
filled
the
air.
Sansa
had
hidden
her
face
in
her
hands.

Her
father
raised
his
voice
still
higher,
straining
to
be
heard.
“I
betrayed
the
faith
of
my
king
and
the
trust
of
my
friend,
Robert,”
he
shouted.
“I
swore
to
defend
and
protect
his
children,
yet
before
his
blood
was
cold,
I
plotted
to
depose
and
murder
his
son
and
seize
the
throne
for
myself.
Let
the
High
Septon
and
Baelor
the
Beloved
and
the
Seven
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
I
say:
Joffrey
Baratheon
is
the
one
true
heir
to
the
Iron
Throne,
and
by
the
grace
of
all
the
gods,
Lord
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
and
Protector
of
the
Realm.”

A
stone
came
sailing
out
of
the
crowd.
Arya
cried
out
as
she
saw
her
father
hit.
The
gold
cloaks
kept
him
from
falling.
Blood
ran
down
his
face
from
a
deep
gash
across
his
forehead.
More
stones
followed.
One
struck
the
guard
to
Father’s
left.
Another
went
clanging
off
the
breastplate
of
the
knight
in
the
black-and-gold
armor.
Two
of
the
Kingsguard
stepped
in
front
of
Joffrey
and
the
queen,
protecting
them
with
their
shields.

Her
hand
slid
beneath
her
cloak
and
found
Needle
in
its
sheath.
She
tightened
her
fingers
around
the
grip,
squeezing
as
hard
as
she
had
ever
squeezed
anything.
Please,
gods,
keep
him
safe,
she
prayed.
Don’t
let
them
hurt
my
father.

The
High
Septon
knelt
before
Joffrey
and
his
mother.
“As
we
sin,
so
do
we
suffer,”
he
intoned,
in
a
deep
swelling
voice
much
louder
than
Father’s.
“This
man
has
confessed
his
crimes
in
the
sight
of
gods
and
men,
here
in
this
holy
place.”
Rainbows
danced
around
his
head
as
he
lifted
his
hands
in
entreaty.
“The
gods
are
just,
yet
Blessed
Baelor
taught
us
that
they
are
also
merciful.
What
shall
be
done
with
this
traitor,
Your
Grace?”

A
thousand
voices
were
screaming,
but
Arya
never
heard
them.
Prince
Joffrey…
no,
King
Joffrey…
stepped
out
from
behind
the
shields
of
his
Kingsguard.
“My
mother
bids
me
let
Lord
Eddard
take
the
black,
and
Lady
Sansa
has
begged
mercy
for
her
father.”
He
looked
straight
at
Sansa
then,
and
smiled,
and
for
a
moment
Arya
thought
that
the
gods
had
heard
her
prayer,
until
Joffrey
turned
back
to
the
crowd
and
said,
“But
they
have
the
soft
hearts
of
women.
So
long
as
I
am
your
king,
treason
shall
never
go
unpunished.
Ser
Ilyn,
bring
me
his
head!”

The
crowd
roared,
and
Arya
felt
the
statue
of
Baelor
rock
as
they
surged
against
it.
The
High
Septon
clutched
at
the
king’s
cape,
and
Varys
came
rushing
over
waving
his
arms,
and
even
the
queen
was
saying
something
to
him,
but
Joffrey
shook
his
head.
Lords
and
knights
moved
aside
as
he
stepped
through,
tall
and
fleshless,
a
skeleton
in
iron
mail,
the
King’s
Justice.
Dimly,
as
if
from
far
off,
Arya
heard
her
sister
scream.
Sansa
had
fallen
to
her
knees,
sobbing
hysterically.
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
climbed
the
steps
of
the
pulpit.

Arya
wriggled
between
Baelor’s
feet
and
threw
herself
into
the
crowd,
drawing
Needle.
She
landed
on
a
man
in
a
butcher’s
apron,
knocking
him
to
the
ground.
Immediately
someone
slammed
into
her
back
and
she
almost
went
down
herself.
Bodies
closed
in
around
her,
stumbling
and
pushing,
trampling
on
the
poor
butcher.
Arya
slashed
at
them
with
Needle.

High
atop
the
pulpit,
Ser
Ilyn
Payne
gestured
and
the
knight
in
black-and-gold
gave
a
command.
The
gold
cloaks
flung
Lord
Eddard
to
the
marble,
with
his
head
and
chest
out
over
the
edge.

“Here,
you!”
an
angry
voice
shouted
at
Arya,
but
she
bowled
past,
shoving
people
aside,
squirming
between
them,
slamming
into
anyone
in
her
way.
A
hand
fumbled
at
her
leg
and
she
hacked
at
it,
kicked
at
shins.
A
woman
stumbled
and
Arya
ran
up
her
back,
cutting
to
both
sides,
but
it
was
no
good,
no
good,
there
were
too
many
people,
no
sooner
did
she
make
a
hole
than
it
closed
again.
Someone
buffeted
her
aside.
She
could
still
hear
Sansa
screaming.

Ser
Ilyn
drew
a
two-handed
greatsword
from
the
scabbard
on
his
back.
As
he
lifted
the
blade
above
his
head,
sunlight
seemed
to
ripple
and
dance
down
the
dark
metal,
glinting
off
an
edge
sharper
than
any
razor.
Ice,
she
thought,
he
has
Ice!
Her
tears
streamed
down
her
face,
blinding
her.

And
then
a
hand
shot
out
of
the
press
and
closed
round
her
arm
like
a
wolf
trap,
so
hard
that
Needle
went
flying
from
her
hand.
Arya
was
wrenched
off
her
feet.
She
would
have
fallen
if
he
hadn’t
held
her
up,
as
easy
as
if
she
were
a
doll.
A
face
pressed
close
to
hers,
long
black
hair
and
tangled
beard
and
rotten
teeth.
“Don’t
look!”
a
thick
voice
snarled
at
her.

“I…
I…
I…”
Arya
sobbed.

The
old
man
shook
her
so
hard
her
teeth
rattled.
“Shut
your
mouth
and
close
your
eyes,
boy.”
Dimly,
as
if
from
far
away,
she
heard
a…
a
noise…
a
soft
sighing
sound,
as
if
a
million
people
had
let
out
their
breath
at
once.
The
old
man’s
fingers
dug
into
her
arm,
stiff
as
iron.
“Look
at
me.
Yes,
that’s
the
way
of
it,
at
me.”
Sour
wine
perfumed
his
breath.
“Remember,
boy?”

It
was
the
smell
that
did
it.
Arya
saw
the
matted
greasy
hair,
the
patched,
dusty
black
cloak
that
covered
his
twisted
shoulders,
the
hard
black
eyes
squinting
at
her.
And
she
remembered
the
black
brother
who
had
come
to
visit
her
father.

“Know
me
now,
do
you?
There’s
a
bright
boy.”
He
spat.
“They’re
done
here.
You’ll
be
coming
with
me,
and
you’ll
be
keeping
your
mouth
shut.”
When
she
started
to
reply,
he
shook
her
again,
even
harder.
“Shut,
I
said.”

The
plaza
was
beginning
to
empty.
The
press
dissolved
around
them
as
people
drifted
back
to
their
lives.
But
Arya’s
life
was
gone.
Numb,
she
trailed
along
beside…
Yoren,
yes,
his
name
is
Yoren.
She
did
not
recall
him
finding
Needle,
until
he
handed
the
sword
back
to
her.
“Hope
you
can
use
that,
boy.”

“I’m
not—”
she
started.

He
shoved
her
into
a
doorway,
thrust
dirty
fingers
through
her
hair,
and
gave
it
a
twist,
yanking
her
head
back.
“—not
a
smart
boy,
that
what
you
mean
to
say?”

He
had
a
knife
in
his
other
hand.

As
the
blade
flashed
toward
her
face,
Arya
threw
herself
backward,
kicking
wildly,
wrenching
her
head
from
side
to
side,
but
he
had
her
by
the
hair,
so
strong,
she
could
feel
her
scalp
tearing,
and
on
her
lips
the
salt
taste
of
tears.

JAIME

The
new
Lord
of
Riverrun
was
so
angry
that
he
was
shaking.
“We
have
been
deceived,”
he
said.
“This
man
had
played
us
false!”
Pink
spittle
flew
from
his
lips
as
he
jabbed
a
finger
at
Edmure
Tully.
“I
will
have
his
head
off!
I
rule
in
Riverrun,
by
the
king’s
own
decree,
I—”

“Emmon,”
said
his
wife,
“the
Lord
Commander
knows
about
the
king’s
decree.
Ser
Edmure
knows
about
the
king’s
decree.
The
stableboys
know
about
the
king’s
decree.”

“I
am
the
lord,
and
I
will
have
his
head!”

“For
what
crime?”
Thin
as
he
was,
Edmure
still
looked
more
lordly
than
Emmon
Frey.
He
wore
a
quilted
doublet
of
red
wool
with
a
leaping
trout
embroidered
on
its
chest.
His
boots
were
black,
his
breeches
blue.
His
auburn
hair
had
been
washed
and
barbered,
his
red
beard
neatly
trimmed.
“I
did
all
that
was
asked
of
me.”

“Oh?”
Jaime
Lannister
had
not
slept
since
Riverrun
had
opened
its
gates,
and
his
head
was
pounding.
“I
do
not
recall
asking
you
to
let
Ser
Brynden
escape.”

“You
required
me
to
surrender
my
castle,
not
my
uncle.
Am
I
to
blame
if
your
men
let
him
slip
through
their
siege
lines?”

Jaime
was
not
amused.
“Where
is
he?”
he
said,
letting
his
irritation
show.
His
men
had
searched
Riverrun
thrice
over,
and
Brynden
Tully
was
nowhere
to
be
found.

“He
never
told
me
where
he
meant
to
go.”

“And
you
never
asked.
How
did
he
get
out?”

“Fish
swim.
Even
black
ones.”
Edmure
smiled.

Jaime
was
sorely
tempted
to
crack
him
across
the
mouth
with
his
golden
hand.
A
few
missing
teeth
would
put
an
end
to
his
smiles.
For
a
man
who
was
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
a
prisoner,
Edmure
was
entirely
too
pleased
with
himself.
“We
have
oubliettes
beneath
the
Casterly
Rock
that
fit
a
man
as
tight
as
a
suit
of
armor.
You
can’t
turn
in
them,
or
sit,
or
reach
down
to
your
feet
when
the
rats
start
gnawing
at
your
toes.
Would
you
care
to
reconsider
that
answer?”

Lord
Edmure’s
smile
went
away.
“You
gave
me
your
word
that
I
would
be
treated
honorably,
as
befits
my
rank.”

“So
you
shall,”
said
Jaime.
“Nobler
knights
than
you
have
died
whimpering
in
those
oubliettes,
and
many
a
high
lord
too.
Even
a
king
or
two,
if
I
recall
my
history.
Your
wife
can
have
the
one
beside
you,
if
you
like.
I
would
not
want
to
part
you.”

“He
did
swim,”
said
Edmure,
sullenly.
He
had
the
same
blue
eyes
as
his
sister
Catelyn,
and
Jaime
saw
the
same
loathing
there
that
he’d
once
seen
in
hers.
“We
raised
the
portcullis
on
the
Water
Gate.
Not
all
the
way,
just
three
feet
or
so.
Enough
to
leave
a
gap
under
the
water,
though
the
gate
still
appeared
to
be
closed.
My
uncle
is
a
strong
swimmer.
After
dark,
he
pulled
himself
beneath
the
spikes.”

And
he
slipped
under
our
boom
the
same
way,
no
doubt.
A
moonless
night,
bored
guards,
a
black
fish
in
a
black
river
floating
quietly
downstream.
If
Ruttiger
or
Yew
or
any
of
their
men
heard
a
splash,
they
would
put
it
down
to
a
turtle
or
a
trout.
Edmure
had
waited
most
of
the
day
before
hauling
down
the
direwolf
of
Stark
in
token
of
surrender.
In
the
confusion
of
the
castle
changing
hands,
it
had
been
the
next
morning
before
Jaime
had
been
informed
that
the
Blackfish
was
not
amongst
the
prisoners.

He
went
to
the
window
and
gazed
out
over
the
river.
It
was
a
bright
autumn
day,
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
waters.
By
now
the
Blackfish
could
be
ten
leagues
downstream.

“You
have
to
find
him,”
insisted
Emmon
Frey.

“He’ll
be
found.”
Jaime
spoke
with
a
certainty
he
did
not
feel.
“I
have
hounds
and
hunters
sniffing
after
him
even
now.”
Ser
Addam
Marbrand
was
leading
the
search
on
the
south
side
of
the
river,
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood
on
the
north.
He
had
considered
enlisting
the
riverlords
as
well,
but
Vance
and
Piper
and
their
ilk
were
more
like
to
help
the
Blackfish
escape
than
clap
him
into
fetters.
All
in
all,
he
was
not
hopeful.
“He
may
elude
us
for
a
time,”
he
said,
“but
eventually
he
must
surface.”

“What
if
he
should
try
and
take
my
castle
back?”

“You
have
a
garrison
of
two
hundred.”
Too
large
a
garrison,
in
truth,
but
Lord
Emmon
had
an
anxious
disposition.
At
least
he
would
have
no
trouble
feeding
them;
the
Blackfish
had
left
Riverrun
amply
provisioned,
just
as
he
had
claimed.
“After
the
trouble
Ser
Brynden
took
to
leave
us,
I
doubt
that
he’ll
come
skulking
back.”
Unless
it
is
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
outlaws.
He
did
not
doubt
that
the
Blackfish
meant
to
continue
the
fight.

“This
is
your
seat,”
Lady
Genna
told
her
husband.
“It
is
for
you
to
hold
it.
If
you
cannot
do
that,
put
it
to
the
torch
and
run
back
to
the
Rock.”

Lord
Emmon
rubbed
his
mouth.
His
hand
came
away
red
and
slimy
from
the
sourleaf.
“To
be
sure.
Riverrun
is
mine,
and
no
man
shall
ever
take
it
from
me.”
He
gave
Edmure
Tully
one
last
suspicious
look,
as
Lady
Genna
drew
him
from
the
solar.

“Is
there
any
more
that
you
would
care
to
tell
me?”
Jaime
asked
Edmure
when
the
two
of
them
were
alone.

“This
was
my
father’s
solar,”
said
Tully.
“He
ruled
the
riverlands
from
here,
wisely
and
well.
He
liked
to
sit
beside
that
window.
The
light
was
good
there,
and
whenever
he
looked
up
from
his
work
he
could
see
the
river.
When
his
eyes
were
tired
he
would
have
Cat
read
to
him.
Littlefinger
and
I
built
a
castle
out
of
wooden
blocks
once,
there
beside
the
door.
You
will
never
know
how
sick
it
makes
me
to
see
you
in
this
room,
Kingslayer.
You
will
never
know
how
much
I
despise
you.”

He
was
wrong
about
that.
“I
have
been
despised
by
better
men
than
you,
Edmure.”
Jaime
called
for
a
guard.
“Take
his
lordship
back
to
his
tower
and
see
that
he’s
fed.”

The
Lord
of
Riverrun
went
silently.
On
the
morrow,
he
would
start
west.
Ser
Forley
Prester
would
command
his
escort;
a
hundred
men,
including
twenty
knights.
Best
double
that.
Lord
Beric
may
try
to
free
Edmure
before
they
reach
the
Golden
Tooth.
Jaime
did
not
want
to
have
to
capture
Tully
for
a
third
time.

He
returned
to
Hoster
Tully’s
chair,
pulled
over
the
map
of
the
Trident,
and
flattened
it
beneath
his
golden
hand.
Where
would
I
go,
if
I
were
the
Blackfish?

“Lord
Commander?”
A
guardsman
stood
in
the
open
door.
“Lady
Westerling
and
her
daughter
are
without,
as
you
commanded.”

Jaime
shoved
the
map
aside.
“Show
them
in.”
At
least
the
girl
did
not
vanish
too.
Jeyne
Westerling
had
been
Robb
Stark’s
queen,
the
girl
who
cost
him
everything.
With
a
wolf
in
her
belly,
she
could
have
proved
more
dangerous
than
the
Blackfish.

She
did
not
look
dangerous.
Jeyne
was
a
willowy
girl,
no
more
than
fifteen
or
sixteen,
more
awkward
than
graceful.
She
had
narrow
hips,
breasts
the
size
of
apples,
a
mop
of
chestnut
curls,
and
the
soft
brown
eyes
of
a
doe.
Pretty
enough
for
a
child,
Jaime
decided,
but
not
a
girl
to
lose
a
kingdom
for.
Her
face
was
puffy,
and
there
was
a
scab
on
her
forehead,
half-hidden
by
a
lock
of
brown
hair.
“What
happened
there?”
he
asked
her.

The
girl
turned
her
head
away.
“It
is
nothing,”
insisted
her
mother,
a
stern-faced
woman
in
a
gown
of
green
velvet.
A
necklace
of
golden
seashells
looped
about
her
long,
thin
neck.
“She
would
not
give
up
the
little
crown
the
rebel
gave
her,
and
when
I
tried
to
take
it
from
her
head
the
willful
child
fought
me.”

“It
was
mine.”
Jeyne
sobbed.
“You
had
no
right.
Robb
had
it
made
for
me.
I
loved
him.”

Her
mother
made
to
slap
her,
but
Jaime
stepped
between
them.
“None
of
that,”
he
warned
Lady
Sybell.
“Sit
down,
both
of
you.”
The
girl
curled
up
in
her
chair
like
a
frightened
animal,
but
her
mother
sat
stiffly,
her
head
high.
“Will
you
have
wine?”
he
asked
them.
The
girl
did
not
answer.
“No,
thank
you,”
said
her
mother.

“As
you
will.”
Jaime
turned
to
the
daughter.
“I
am
sorry
for
your
loss.
The
boy
had
courage,
I’ll
give
him
that.
There
is
a
question
I
must
ask
you.
Are
you
carrying
his
child,
my
lady?”

Jeyne
burst
from
her
chair
and
would
have
fled
the
room
if
the
guard
at
the
door
had
not
seized
her
by
the
arm.
“She
is
not,”
said
Lady
Sybell,
as
her
daughter
struggled
to
escape.
“I
made
certain
of
that,
as
your
lord
father
bid
me.”

Jaime
nodded.
Tywin
Lannister
was
not
a
man
to
overlook
such
details.
“Unhand
the
girl,”
he
said,
“I’m
done
with
her
for
now.”
As
Jeyne
fled
sobbing
down
the
stairs,
he
considered
her
mother.
“House
Westerling
has
its
pardon,
and
your
brother
Rolph
has
been
made
Lord
of
Castamere.
What
else
would
you
have
of
us?”

“Your
lord
father
promised
me
worthy
marriages
for
Jeyne
and
her
younger
sister.
Lords
or
heirs,
he
swore
to
me,
not
younger
sons
nor
household
knights.”

Lords
or
heirs.
To
be
sure.
The
Westerlings
were
an
old
House,
and
proud,
but
Lady
Sybell
herself
had
been
born
a
Spicer,
from
a
line
of
upjumped
merchants.
Her
grandmother
had
been
some
sort
of
half-mad
witch
woman
from
the
east,
he
seemed
to
recall.
And
the
Westerlings
were
impoverished.
Younger
sons
would
have
been
the
best
that
Sybell
Spicer’s
daughters
could
have
hoped
for
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
but
a
nice
fat
pot
of
Lannister
gold
would
make
even
a
dead
rebel’s
widow
look
attractive
to
some
lord.
“You’ll
have
your
marriages,”
said
Jaime,
“but
Jeyne
must
wait
two
full
years
before
she
weds
again.”
If
the
girl
took
another
husband
too
soon
and
had
a
child
by
him,
inevitably
there
would
come
whispers
that
the
Young
Wolf
was
the
father.

“I
have
two
sons
as
well,”
Lady
Westerling
reminded
him.
“Rollam
is
with
me,
but
Raynald
was
a
knight
and
went
with
the
rebels
to
the
Twins.
If
I
had
known
what
was
to
happen
there,
I
would
never
have
allowed
that.”
There
was
a
hint
of
reproach
in
her
voice.
“Raynald
knew
nought
of
any...
of
the
understanding
with
your
lord
father.
He
may
be
a
captive
at
the
Twins.”

Or
he
may
be
dead.
Walder
Frey
would
not
have
known
of
the
understanding
either.
“I
will
make
inquiries.
If
Ser
Raynald
is
still
a
captive,
we’ll
pay
his
ransom
for
you.”

“Mention
was
made
of
a
match
for
him
as
well.
A
bride
from
Casterly
Rock.
Your
lord
father
said
that
Raynald
should
have
joy
of
him,
if
all
went
as
we
hoped.”

Even
from
the
grave,
Lord
Tywin’s
dead
hand
moves
us
all.
“Joy
is
my
late
uncle
Gerion’s
natural
daughter.
A
betrothal
can
be
arranged,
if
that
is
your
wish,
but
any
marriage
will
need
to
wait.
Joy
was
nine
or
ten
when
last
I
saw
her.”

“His
natural
daughter?”
Lady
Sybell
looked
as
if
she
had
swallowed
a
lemon.
“You
want
a
Westerling
to
wed
a
bastard?”

“No
more
than
I
want
Joy
to
marry
the
son
of
some
scheming
turncloak
bitch.
She
deserves
better.”
Jaime
would
happily
have
strangled
the
woman
with
her
seashell
necklace.
Joy
was
a
sweet
child,
albeit
a
lonely
one;
her
father
had
been
Jaime’s
favorite
uncle.
“Your
daughter
is
worth
ten
of
you,
my
lady.
You’ll
leave
with
Edmure
and
Ser
Forley
on
the
morrow.
Until
then,
you
would
do
well
to
stay
out
of
my
sight.”
He
shouted
for
a
guardsman,
and
Lady
Sybell
went
off
with
her
lips
pressed
primly
together.
Jaime
had
to
wonder
how
much
Lord
Gawen
knew
about
his
wife’s
scheming.
How
much
do
we
men
ever
know?

When
Edmure
and
the
Westerlings
departed,
four
hundred
men
rode
with
them;
Jaime
had
doubled
the
escort
again
at
the
last
moment.
He
rode
with
them
a
few
miles,
to
talk
with
Ser
Forley
Prester.
Though
he
bore
a
bull’s
head
upon
his
surcoat
and
horns
upon
his
helm,
Ser
Forley
could
not
have
been
less
bovine.
He
was
a
short,
spare,
hard-bitten
man.
With
his
pinched
nose,
bald
pate,
and
grizzled
brown
beard,
he
looked
more
like
an
innkeep
than
a
knight.
“We
don’t
know
where
the
Blackfish
is,”
Jaime
reminded
him,
“but
if
he
can
cut
Edmure
free,
he
will.”

“That
will
not
happen,
my
lord.”
Like
most
innkeeps,
Ser
Forley
was
no
man’s
fool.
“Scouts
and
outriders
will
screen
our
march,
and
we’ll
fortify
our
camps
by
night.
I
have
picked
ten
men
to
stay
with
Tully
day
and
night,
my
best
longbowmen.
If
he
should
ride
so
much
as
a
foot
off
the
road,
they
will
loose
so
many
shafts
at
him
that
his
own
mother
would
take
him
for
a
goose.”

“Good.”
Jaime
would
as
lief
have
Tully
reach
Casterly
Rock
safely,
but
better
dead
than
fled.
“Best
keep
some
archers
near
Lord
Westerling’s
daughter
as
well.”

Ser
Forley
seemed
taken
aback.
“Gawen’s
girl?
She’s—”

“—the
Young
Wolf’s
widow,”
Jaime
finished,
“and
twice
as
dangerous
as
Edmure
if
she
were
ever
to
escape
us.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord.
She
will
be
watched.”

Jaime
had
to
canter
past
the
Westerlings
as
he
rode
down
the
column
on
his
way
back
to
Riverrun.
Lord
Gawen
nodded
gravely
as
he
passed,
but
Lady
Sybell
looked
through
him
with
eyes
like
chips
of
ice.
Jeyne
never
saw
him
at
all.
The
widow
rode
with
downcast
eyes,
huddled
beneath
a
hooded
cloak.
Underneath
its
heavy
folds,
her
clothes
were
finely
made,
but
torn.
She
ripped
them
herself,
as
a
mark
of
mourning,
Jaime
realized.
That
could
not
have
pleased
her
mother.
He
found
himself
wondering
if
Cersei
would
tear
her
gown
if
she
should
ever
hear
that
he
was
dead.

He
did
not
go
straight
back
to
the
castle
but
crossed
the
Tumblestone
once
more
to
call
on
Edwyn
Frey
and
discuss
the
transfer
of
his
great-grandfather’s
prisoners.
The
Frey
host
had
begun
to
break
up
within
hours
of
Riverrun’s
surrender,
as
Lord
Walder’s
bannermen
and
freeriders
pulled
up
stakes
to
make
for
home.
The
Freys
who
still
remained
were
striking
camp,
but
he
found
Edwyn
with
his
bastard
uncle
in
the
latter’s
pavilion.

The
two
of
them
were
huddled
over
a
map,
arguing
heatedly,
but
they
broke
off
when
Jaime
entered.
“Lord
Commander,”
Rivers
said
with
cold
courtesy,
but
Edwyn
blurted
out,
“My
father’s
blood
is
on
your
hands,
ser.”

That
took
Jaime
a
bit
aback.
“How
so?”

“You
were
the
one
who
sent
him
home,
were
you
not?”

Someone
had
to.
“Has
some
ill
befallen
Ser
Ryman?”

“Hanged
with
all
his
party,”
said
Walder
Rivers.
“The
outlaws
caught
them
two
leagues
south
of
Fairmarket.”

“Dondarrion?”

“Him,
or
Thoros,
or
this
woman
Stoneheart.”

Jaime
frowned.
Ryman
Frey
had
been
a
fool,
a
craven,
and
a
sot,
and
no
one
was
like
to
miss
him
much,
least
of
all
his
fellow
Freys.
If
Edwyn’s
dry
eyes
were
any
clue,
even
his
own
sons
would
not
mourn
him
long.
Still...
these
outlaws
are
growing
bold,
if
they
dare
hang
Lord
Walder’s
heir
not
a
day’s
ride
from
the
Twins.
“How
many
men
did
Ser
Ryman
have
with
him?”
he
asked.

“Three
knights
and
a
dozen
men-at-arms,”
said
Rivers.
“It
is
almost
as
if
they
knew
that
he
would
be
returning
to
the
Twins,
and
with
a
small
escort.”

Edwyn’s
mouth
twisted.
“My
brother
had
a
hand
in
this,
I’ll
wager.
He
allowed
the
outlaws
to
escape
after
they
murdered
Merrett
and
Petyr,
and
this
is
why.
With
our
father
dead,
there’s
only
me
left
between
Black
Walder
and
the
Twins.”

“You
have
no
proof
of
this,”
said
Walder
Rivers.

“I
do
not
need
proof.
I
know
my
brother.”

“Your
brother
is
at
Seagard,”
Rivers
insisted.
“How
could
he
have
known
that
Ser
Ryman
was
returning
to
the
Twins?”

“Someone
told
him,”
said
Edwyn
in
a
bitter
tone.
“He
has
his
spies
in
our
camp,
you
can
be
sure.”

And
you
have
yours
at
Seagard.
Jaime
knew
that
the
enmity
between
Edwyn
and
Black
Walder
ran
deep,
but
cared
not
a
fig
which
of
them
succeeded
their
great-grandfather
as
Lord
of
the
Crossing.

“If
you
will
pardon
me
for
intruding
on
your
grief,”
he
said,
in
a
dry
tone,
“we
have
other
matters
to
consider.
When
you
return
to
the
Twins,
please
inform
Lord
Walder
that
King
Tommen
requires
all
the
captives
you
took
at
the
Red
Wedding.”

Ser
Walder
frowned.
“These
prisoners
are
valuable,
ser.”

“His
Grace
would
not
ask
for
them
if
they
were
worthless.”

Frey
and
Rivers
exchanged
a
look.
Edwyn
said,
“My
lord
grandfather
will
expect
recompense
for
these
prisoners.”

And
he’ll
have
it,
as
soon
as
I
grow
a
new
hand,
thought
Jaime.
“We
all
have
expectations,”
he
said
mildly.
“Tell
me,
is
Ser
Raynald
Westerling
amongst
these
captives?”

“The
knight
of
seashells?”
Edwyn
sneered.
“You’ll
find
that
one
feeding
the
fish
at
the
bottom
of
the
Green
Fork.”

“He
was
in
the
yard
when
our
men
came
to
put
the
direwolf
down,”
said
Walder
Rivers.
“Whalen
demanded
his
sword
and
he
gave
it
over
meek
enough,
but
when
the
crossbowmen
began
feathering
the
wolf
he
seized
Whalen’s
axe
and
cut
the
monster
loose
of
the
net
they’d
thrown
over
him.
Whalen
says
he
took
a
quarrel
in
his
shoulder
and
another
in
the
gut,
but
still
managed
to
reach
the
wallwalk
and
throw
himself
into
the
river.”

“He
left
a
trail
of
blood
on
the
steps,”
said
Edwyn.

“Did
you
find
his
corpse
afterward?”
asked
Jaime.

“We
found
a
thousand
corpses
afterward.
Once
they’ve
spent
a
few
days
in
the
river
they
all
look
much
the
same.”

“I’ve
heard
the
same
is
true
of
hanged
men,”
said
Jaime,
before
he
took
his
leave.

By
the
next
morning
little
remained
of
the
Frey
encampment
but
flies,
horse
dung,
and
Ser
Ryman’s
gallows,
standing
forlorn
beside
the
Tumblestone.
His
coz
wanted
to
know
what
should
be
done
with
it,
and
with
the
siege
equipment
he
had
built,
his
rams
and
sows
and
towers
and
treb-uchets.
Daven
proposed
that
they
drag
it
all
to
Raventree
and
use
it
there.
Jaime
told
him
to
put
everything
to
the
torch,
starting
with
the
gallows.
“I
mean
to
deal
with
Lord
Tytos
myself.
It
won’t
require
a
siege
tower.”

Daven
grinned
through
his
bushy
beard.
“Single
combat,
coz?
Scarce
seems
fair.
Tytos
is
an
old
grey
man.”

An
old
grey
man
with
two
hands.

That
night
he
and
Ser
Ilyn
fought
for
three
hours.
It
was
one
of
his
better
nights.
If
they
had
been
in
earnest,
Payne
only
would
have
killed
him
twice.
Half
a
dozen
deaths
were
more
the
rule,
and
some
nights
were
worse
than
that.
“If
I
keep
at
this
for
another
year,
I
may
be
as
good
as
Peck,”
Jaime
declared,
and
Ser
Ilyn
made
that
clacking
sound
that
meant
he
was
amused.
“Come,
let’s
drink
some
more
of
Hoster
Tully’s
good
red
wine.”

Wine
had
become
a
part
of
their
nightly
ritual.
Ser
Ilyn
made
the
perfect
drinking
companion.
He
never
interrupted,
never
disagreed,
never
complained
or
asked
for
favors
or
told
long
pointless
stories.
All
he
did
was
drink
and
listen.

“I
should
have
the
tongues
removed
from
all
my
friends,”
said
Jaime
as
he
filled
their
cups,
“and
from
my
kin
as
well.
A
silent
Cersei
would
be
sweet.
Though
I’d
miss
her
tongue
when
we
kissed.”
He
drank.
The
wine
was
a
deep
red,
sweet
and
heavy.
It
warmed
him
going
down.
“I
can’t
remember
when
we
first
began
to
kiss.
It
was
innocent
at
first.
Until
it
wasn’t.”
He
finished
the
wine
and
set
his
cup
aside.
“Tyrion
once
told
me
that
most
whores
will
not
kiss
you.
They’ll
fuck
you
blind,
he
said,
but
you’ll
never
feel
their
lips
on
yours.
Do
you
think
my
sister
kisses
Kettleblack?”

Ser
Ilyn
did
not
answer.

“I
don’t
think
it
would
be
proper
for
me
to
slay
mine
own
Sworn
Brother.
What
I
need
to
do
is
geld
him
and
send
him
to
the
Wall.
That’s
what
they
did
with
Lucamore
the
Lusty.
Ser
Osmund
may
not
take
kindly
to
the
gelding,
to
be
sure.
And
there
are
his
brothers
to
consider.
Brothers
can
be
dangerous.
After
Aegon
the
Unworthy
put
Ser
Terrence
Toyne
to
death
for
sleeping
with
his
mistress,
Toyne’s
brothers
did
their
best
to
kill
him.
Their
best
was
not
quite
good
enough,
thanks
to
the
Dragonknight,
but
it
was
not
for
want
of
trying.
It’s
written
down
in
the
White
Book.
All
of
it,
save
what
to
do
with
Cersei.”

Ser
Ilyn
drew
a
finger
across
his
throat.

“No,”
said
Jaime.
“Tommen
has
lost
a
brother,
and
the
man
he
thought
of
as
his
father.
If
I
were
to
kill
his
mother,
he
would
hate
me
for
it...
and
that
sweet
little
wife
of
his
would
find
a
way
to
turn
that
hatred
to
the
benefit
of
Highgarden.”

Ser
Ilyn
smiled
in
a
way
Jaime
did
not
like.
An
ugly
smile.
An
ugly
soul.
“You
talk
too
much,”
he
told
the
man.

The
next
day
Ser
Dermot
of
the
Rainwood
returned
to
the
castle,
empty-handed.
When
asked
what
he’d
found,
he
answered,
“Wolves.
Hundreds
of
the
bloody
beggars.”
He’d
lost
two
sentries
to
them.
The
wolves
had
come
out
of
the
dark
to
savage
them.
“Armed
men
in
mail
and
boiled
leather,
and
yet
the
beasts
had
no
fear
of
them.
Before
he
died,
Jate
said
the
pack
was
led
by
a
she-wolf
of
monstrous
size.
A
direwolf,
to
hear
him
tell
it.
The
wolves
got
in
amongst
our
horse
lines
too.
The
bloody
bastards
killed
my
favorite
bay.”

“A
ring
of
fires
round
your
camp
might
keep
them
off,”
said
Jaime,
though
he
wondered.
Could
Ser
Dermot’s
direwolf
be
the
same
beast
that
had
mauled
Joffrey
near
the
crossroads?

Wolves
or
no,
Ser
Dermot
took
fresh
horses
and
more
men
and
went
out
again
the
next
morning,
to
resume
the
search
for
Brynden
Tully.
That
same
afternoon,
the
lords
of
the
Trident
came
to
Jaime
asking
his
leave
to
return
to
their
own
lands.
He
granted
it.
Lord
Piper
also
wanted
to
know
about
his
son
Marq.
“All
the
captives
will
be
ransomed,”
Jaime
promised.
As
the
riverlords
took
their
leave,
Lord
Karyl
Vance
lingered
to
say,
“Lord
Jaime,
you
must
go
to
Raventree.
So
long
as
it
is
Jonos
at
his
gates
Tytos
will
never
yield,
but
I
know
he
will
bend
his
knee
for
you.”
Jaime
thanked
him
for
his
counsel.

Strongboar
was
the
next
to
depart.
He
wanted
to
return
to
Darry
as
he’d
promised
and
fight
the
outlaws.
“We
rode
across
half
the
bloody
realm
and
for
what?
So
you
could
make
Edmure
Tully
piss
his
breeches?
There’s
no
song
in
that.
I
need
a
fight.
I
want
the
Hound,
Jaime.
Him,
or
the
marcher
lord.”

“The
Hound’s
head
is
yours
if
you
can
take
it,”
Jaime
said,
“but
Beric
Dondarrion
is
to
be
captured
alive,
so
he
can
be
brought
back
to
King’s
Landing.
A
thousand
people
need
to
see
him
die,
or
else
he
won’t
stay
dead.”
Strongboar
grumbled
at
that,
but
finally
agreed.
The
next
day
he
departed
with
his
squire
and
men-at-arms,
plus
Beardless
Jon
Bettley,
who
had
decided
that
hunting
outlaws
was
preferable
to
returning
to
his
famously
homely
wife.
Supposedly
she
had
the
beard
that
Bettley
lacked.

Jaime
still
had
the
garrison
to
deal
with.
To
a
man,
they
swore
that
they
knew
nothing
of
Ser
Brynden’s
plans
or
where
he
might
have
gone.
“They
are
lying,”
Emmon
Frey
insisted,
but
Jaime
thought
not.
“If
you
share
your
plans
with
no
one,
no
one
can
betray
you,”
he
pointed
out.
Lady
Genna
suggested
that
a
few
of
the
men
might
be
put
to
the
question.
He
refused.
“I
gave
Edmure
my
word
that
if
he
yielded,
the
garrison
could
leave
unharmed.”

“That
was
chivalrous
of
you,”
his
aunt
said,
“but
it’s
strength
that’s
needed
here,
not
chivalry.”

Ask
Edmure
how
chivalrous
I
am,
thought
Jaime.
Ask
him
about
the
trebuchet.
Somehow
he
did
not
think
the
maesters
were
like
to
confuse
him
with
Prince
Aemon
the
Dragonknight
when
they
wrote
their
histories.
Still,
he
felt
curiously
content.
The
war
was
all
but
won.
Dragonstone
had
fallen
and
Storm’s
End
would
soon
enough,
he
could
not
doubt,
and
Stannis
was
welcome
to
the
Wall.
The
northmen
would
love
him
no
more
than
the
storm
lords
had.
If
Roose
Bolton
did
not
destroy
him,
winter
would.

And
he
had
done
his
own
part
here
at
Riverrun
without
actually
ever
taking
up
arms
against
the
Starks
or
Tullys.
Once
he
found
the
Blackfish,
he
would
be
free
to
return
to
King’s
Landing,
where
he
belonged.
My
place
is
with
my
king.
With
my
son.
Would
Tommen
want
to
know
that?
The
truth
could
cost
the
boy
his
throne.
Would
you
sooner
have
a
father
or
a
chair,
lad?
Jaime
wished
he
knew
the
answer.
He
does
like
stamping
papers
with
his
seal.
The
boy
might
not
even
believe
him,
to
be
sure.
Cersei
would
say
it
was
a
lie.
My
sweet
sister,
the
deceiver.
He
would
need
to
find
some
way
to
winkle
Tommen
from
her
clutches
before
the
boy
became
another
Joffrey.
And
whilst
at
that,
he
should
find
the
lad
a
new
small
council
too.
If
Cersei
can
be
put
aside,
Ser
Kevan
may
agree
to
serve
as
Tommen’s
Hand.
And
if
not,
well,
the
Seven
Kingdoms
did
not
lack
for
able
men.
Forley
Prester
would
make
a
good
choice,
or
Roland
Crakehall.
If
someone
other
than
a
westerman
was
needed
to
appease
the
Tyrells,
there
was
always
Mathis
Rowan...
or
even
Petyr
Baelish.
Littlefinger
was
as
amiable
as
he
was
clever,
but
too
lowborn
to
threaten
any
of
the
great
lords,
with
no
swords
of
his
own.
The
perfect
Hand.

The
Tully
garrison
departed
the
next
morning,
stripped
of
all
their
arms
and
armor.
Each
man
was
allowed
three
days’
food
and
the
clothing
on
his
back,
after
he
swore
a
solemn
oath
never
to
take
up
arms
against
Lord
Emmon
or
House
Lannister.
“If
you’re
fortunate,
one
man
in
ten
may
keep
that
vow,”
Lady
Genna
said.

“Good.
I’d
sooner
face
nine
men
than
ten.
The
tenth
might
have
been
the
one
who
would
have
killed
me.”

“The
other
nine
will
kill
you
just
as
quick.”

“Better
that
than
die
in
bed.”
Or
on
the
privy.

Two
men
did
not
choose
to
depart
with
the
others.
Ser
Desmond
Grell,
Lord
Hoster’s
old
master-at-arms,
preferred
to
take
the
black.
So
did
Ser
Robin
Ryger,
Riverrun’s
captain
of
guards.
“This
castle’s
been
my
home
for
forty
years,”
said
Grell.
“You
say
I’m
free
to
go,
but
where?
I’m
too
old
and
too
stout
to
make
a
hedge
knight.
But
men
are
always
welcome
at
the
Wall.”

“As
you
wish,”
said
Jaime,
though
it
was
a
bloody
nuisance.
He
allowed
them
to
keep
their
arms
and
armor,
and
assigned
a
dozen
of
Gregor
Clegane’s
men
to
escort
the
two
of
them
to
Maidenpool.
The
command
he
gave
to
Rafford,
the
one
they
called
the
Sweetling.
“See
to
it
that
the
prisoners
reach
Maidenpool
unspoiled,”
he
told
the
man,
“or
what
Ser
Gregor
did
to
the
Goat
will
seem
a
jolly
lark
compared
to
what
I’ll
do
to
you.”

More
days
passed.
Lord
Emmon
assembled
all
of
Riverrun
in
the
yard,
Lord
Edmure’s
people
and
his
own,
and
spoke
to
them
for
close
on
three
hours
about
what
would
be
expected
of
them
now
that
he
was
their
lord
and
master.
From
time
to
time
he
waved
his
parchment,
as
stableboys
and
serving
girls
and
smiths
listened
in
a
sullen
silence
and
a
light
rain
fell
down
upon
them
all.

The
singer
was
listening
too,
the
one
that
Jaime
had
taken
from
Ser
Ryman
Frey.
Jaime
came
upon
him
standing
inside
an
open
door,
where
it
was
dry.
“His
lordship
should
have
been
a
singer,”
the
man
said.
“This
speech
is
longer
than
a
marcher
ballad,
and
I
don’t
think
he’s
stopped
for
breath.”

Jaime
had
to
laugh.
“Lord
Emmon
does
not
need
to
breathe,
so
long
as
he
can
chew.
Are
you
going
to
make
a
song
of
it?”

“A
funny
one.
I’ll
call
it
‘Talking
to
the
Fish.’”

“Just
don’t
play
it
where
my
aunt
can
hear.”
Jaime
had
never
paid
the
man
much
mind
before.
He
was
a
small
fellow,
garbed
in
ragged
green
breeches
and
a
frayed
tunic
of
a
lighter
shade
of
green,
with
brown
leather
patches
covering
the
holes.
His
nose
was
long
and
sharp,
his
smile
big
and
loose.
Thin
brown
hair
fell
to
his
collar,
snaggled
and
unwashed.
Fifty
if
he’s
a
day,
thought
Jaime,
a
hedge
harp,
and
hard
used
by
life.
“Weren’t
you
Ser
Ryman’s
man
when
I
found
you?”
he
asked.

“Only
for
a
fortnight.”

“I
would
have
expected
you
to
depart
with
the
Freys.”

“That
one
up
there’s
a
Frey,”
the
singer
said,
nodding
at
Lord
Emmon,
“and
this
castle
seems
a
nice
snug
place
to
pass
the
winter.
Whitesmile
Wat
went
home
with
Ser
Forley,
so
I
thought
I’d
see
if
I
could
win
his
place.
Wat’s
got
that
high
sweet
voice
that
the
likes
o’
me
can’t
hope
to
match.
But
I
know
twice
as
many
bawdy
songs
as
he
does.
Begging
my
lord’s
pardon.”

“You
should
get
on
famously
with
my
aunt,”
said
Jaime.
“If
you
hope
to
winter
here,
see
that
your
playing
pleases
Lady
Genna.
She’s
the
one
that
matters.”

“Not
you?”

“My
place
is
with
the
king.
I
shall
not
stay
here
long.”

“I’m
sorry
to
hear
that,
my
lord.
I
know
better
songs
than
‘The
Rains
of
Castamere.’
I
could
have
played
you...
oh,
all
sorts
o’
things.”

“Some
other
time,”
said
Jaime.
“Do
you
have
a
name?”

“Tom
of
Sevenstreams,
if
it
please
my
lord.”
The
singer
doffed
his
hat.
“Most
call
me
Tom
o’
Sevens,
though.”

“Sing
sweetly,
Tom
o’
Sevens.”

That
night
he
dreamt
that
he
was
back
in
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor,
still
standing
vigil
over
his
father’s
corpse.
The
sept
was
still
and
dark,
until
a
woman
emerged
from
the
shadows
and
walked
slowly
to
the
bier.
“Sister?”
he
said.

But
it
was
not
Cersei.
She
was
all
in
grey,
a
silent
sister.
A
hood
and
veil
concealed
her
features,
but
he
could
see
the
candles
burning
in
the
green
pools
of
her
eyes.
“Sister,”
he
said,
“what
would
you
have
of
me?”
His
last
word
echoed
up
and
down
the
sept,
mememememememememememe.

“I
am
not
your
sister,
Jaime.”
She
raised
a
pale
soft
hand
and
pushed
her
hood
back.
“Have
you
forgotten
me?”

Can
I
forget
someone
I
never
knew?
The
words
caught
in
his
throat.
He
did
know
her,
but
it
had
been
so
long...

“Will
you
forget
your
own
lord
father
too?
I
wonder
if
you
ever
knew
him,
truly.”
Her
eyes
were
green,
her
hair
spun
gold.
He
could
not
tell
how
old
she
was.
Fifteen,
he
thought,
or
fifty.
She
climbed
the
steps
to
stand
above
the
bier.
“He
could
never
abide
being
laughed
at.
That
was
the
thing
he
hated
most.”

“Who
are
you?”
He
had
to
hear
her
say
it.

“The
question
is,
who
are
you?”

“This
is
a
dream.”

“Is
it?”
She
smiled
sadly.
“Count
your
hands,
child.”

One.
One
hand,
clasped
tight
around
the
sword
hilt.
Only
one.
“In
my
dreams
I
always
have
two
hands.”
He
raised
his
right
arm
and
stared
uncomprehending
at
the
ugliness
of
his
stump.

“We
all
dream
of
things
we
cannot
have.
Tywin
dreamed
that
his
son
would
be
a
great
knight,
that
his
daughter
would
be
a
queen.
He
dreamed
they
would
be
so
strong
and
brave
and
beautiful
that
no
one
would
ever
laugh
at
them.”

“I
am
a
knight,”
he
told
her,
“and
Cersei
is
a
queen.”

A
tear
rolled
down
her
cheek.
The
woman
raised
her
hood
again
and
turned
her
back
on
him.
Jaime
called
after
her,
but
already
she
was
moving
away,
her
skirt
whispering
lullabies
as
it
brushed
across
the
floor.
Don’t
leave
me,
he
wanted
to
call,
but
of
course
she’d
left
them
long
ago.

He
woke
in
darkness,
shivering.
The
room
had
grown
cold
as
ice.
Jaime
flung
aside
the
covers
with
the
stump
of
his
sword
hand.
The
fire
in
the
hearth
had
died,
he
saw,
and
the
window
had
blown
open.
He
crossed
the
pitch-dark
chamber
to
fumble
with
the
shutters,
but
when
he
reached
the
window
his
bare
foot
came
down
in
something
wet.
Jaime
recoiled,
startled
for
a
moment.
His
first
thought
was
of
blood,
but
blood
would
not
have
been
so
cold.

It
was
snow,
drifting
through
the
window.

Instead
of
closing
the
shutters
he
threw
them
wide.
The
yard
below
was
covered
by
a
thin
white
blanket,
growing
thicker
even
as
he
watched.
The
merlons
on
the
battlements
wore
white
cowls.
The
flakes
fell
silently,
a
few
drifting
in
the
window
to
melt
upon
his
face.
Jaime
could
see
his
own
breath.

Snow
in
the
riverlands.
If
it
was
snowing
here,
it
could
well
be
snowing
on
Lannisport
as
well,
and
on
King’s
Landing.
Winter
is
marching
south,
and
half
our
granaries
are
empty.
Any
crops
still
in
the
fields
were
doomed.
There
would
be
no
more
plantings,
no
more
hopes
of
one
last
harvest.
He
found
himself
wondering
what
his
father
would
do
to
feed
the
realm,
before
he
remembered
that
Tywin
Lannister
was
dead.

When
morning
broke
the
snow
was
ankle
deep,
and
deeper
in
the
godswood,
where
drifts
had
piled
up
under
the
trees.
Squires,
stableboys,
and
highborn
pages
turned
to
children
again
under
its
cold
white
spell,
and
fought
a
snowball
war
up
and
down
the
wards
and
all
along
the
battlements.
Jaime
heard
them
laughing.
There
was
a
time,
not
long
ago,
when
he
might
have
been
out
making
snowballs
with
the
best
of
them,
to
fling
at
Tyrion
when
he
waddled
by,
or
slip
down
the
back
of
Cersei’s
gown.
You
need
two
hands
to
make
a
decent
snowball,
though.

There
was
a
rap
upon
his
door.
“See
who
that
is,
Peck.”

It
was
Riverrun’s
old
maester,
with
a
message
clutched
in
his
lined
and
wrinkled
hand.
Vyman’s
face
was
as
pale
as
the
new-fallen
snow.
“I
know,”
Jaime
said,
“there
has
been
a
white
raven
from
the
Citadel.
Winter
has
come.”

“No,
my
lord.
The
bird
was
from
King’s
Landing.
I
took
the
liberty...
I
did
not
know...”
He
held
the
letter
out.

Jaime
read
it
in
the
window
seat,
bathed
in
the
light
of
that
cold
white
morning.
Qyburn’s
words
were
terse
and
to
the
point,
Cersei’s
fevered
and
fervent.
Come
at
once,
she
said.
Help
me.
Save
me.
I
need
you
now
as
I
have
never
needed
you
before.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
I
love
you.
Come
at
once.

Vyman
was
hovering
by
the
door,
waiting,
and
Jaime
sensed
that
Peck
was
watching
too.
“Does
my
lord
wish
to
answer?”
the
maester
asked,
after
a
long
silence.

A
snowflake
landed
on
the
letter.
As
it
melted,
the
ink
began
to
blur.
Jaime
rolled
the
parchment
up
again,
as
tight
as
one
hand
would
allow,
and
handed
it
to
Peck.
“No,”
he
said.
“Put
this
in
the
fire.”





SAMWELL

The
most
perilous
part
of
the
voyage
was
the
last.
The
Redwyne
Straits
were
swarming
with
longships,
as
they
had
been
warned
in
Tyrosh.
With
the
main
strength
of
the
Arbor’s
fleet
on
the
far
side
of
Westeros,
the
ironmen
had
sacked
Ryamsport
and
taken
Vinetown
and
Starfish
Harbor
for
their
own,
using
them
as
bases
to
prey
on
shipping
bound
for
Oldtown.

Thrice
longships
were
sighted
by
the
crow’s
nest.
Two
were
well
astern,
however,
and
the
Cinnamon
Wind
soon
outdistanced
them.
The
third
appeared
near
sunset,
to
cut
them
off
from
Whispering
Sound.
When
they
saw
her
oars
rising
and
falling,
lashing
the
copper
waters
white,
Kojja
Mo
sent
her
archers
to
the
castles
with
their
great
bows
of
goldenheart
that
could
send
a
shaft
farther
and
truer
than
even
Dornish
yew.
She
waited
till
the
longship
came
within
two
hundred
yards
before
she
gave
the
command
to
loose.
Sam
loosed
with
them,
and
this
time
he
thought
his
arrow
reached
the
ship.
One
volley
was
all
it
took.
The
longship
veered
south
in
search
of
tamer
prey.

A
deep
blue
dusk
was
falling
as
they
entered
Whispering
Sound.
Gilly
stood
beside
the
prow
with
the
babe,
gazing
up
at
a
castle
on
the
cliffs.
“Three
Towers,”
Sam
told
her,
“the
seat
of
House
Costayne.”
Etched
against
the
evening
stars
with
torchlight
flickering
from
its
windows,
the
castle
made
a
splendid
sight,
but
he
was
sad
to
see
it.
Their
voyage
was
almost
at
its
end.

“It’s
very
tall,”
said
Gilly.

“Wait
until
you
see
the
Hightower.”

Dalla’s
babe
began
to
cry.
Gilly
pulled
open
her
tunic
and
gave
the
boy
her
breast.
She
smiled
as
he
nursed,
and
stroked
his
soft
brown
hair.
She
has
come
to
love
this
one
as
much
as
the
one
she
left
behind,
Sam
realized.
He
hoped
that
the
gods
would
be
kind
to
both
of
the
children.

The
ironmen
had
penetrated
even
to
the
sheltered
waters
of
Whispering
Sound.
Come
morning,
as
the
Cinnamon
Wind
continued
on
toward
Oldtown,
she
began
to
bump
up
against
corpses
drifting
down
to
the
sea.
Some
of
the
bodies
carried
complements
of
crows,
who
rose
into
the
air
complaining
noisily
when
the
swan
ship
disturbed
their
grotesquely
swollen
rafts.
Scorched
fields
and
burned
villages
appeared
on
the
banks,
and
the
shallows
and
sandbars
were
strewn
with
shattered
ships.
Merchanters
and
fishing
boats
were
the
most
common,
but
they
saw
abandoned
longships
too,
and
the
wreckage
of
two
big
dromonds.
One
had
been
burned
down
to
the
waterline,
whilst
the
other
had
a
gaping
splintered
hole
in
her
side
where
her
hull
had
been
rammed.

“Battle
here,”
said
Xhondo.
“Not
so
long.”

“Who
would
be
so
mad
as
to
raid
this
close
to
Oldtown?”

Xhondo
pointed
at
a
half-sunken
longship
in
the
shallows.
The
remnants
of
a
banner
drooped
from
her
stern,
smoke-stained
and
ragged.
The
charge
was
one
Sam
had
never
seen
before:
a
red
eye
with
a
black
pupil,
beneath
a
black
iron
crown
supported
by
two
crows.
“Whose
banner
is
that?”
Sam
asked.
Xhondo
only
shrugged.

The
next
day
was
cold
and
misty.
As
the
Cinnamon
Wind
was
creeping
past
another
plundered
fishing
village,
a
war
galley
came
sliding
from
the
fog,
stroking
slowly
toward
them.
Huntress
was
the
name
she
bore,
behind
a
figurehead
of
a
slender
maiden
clad
in
leaves
and
brandishing
a
spear.
A
heartbeat
later,
two
smaller
galleys
appeared
on
either
side
of
her,
like
a
pair
of
matched
greyhounds
stalking
at
their
master’s
heels.
To
Sam’s
relief,
they
flew
King
Tommen’s
stag-and-lion
banner
above
the
stepped
white
tower
of
Oldtown,
with
its
crown
of
flame.

The
captain
of
the
Huntress
was
a
tall
man
in
a
smoke-grey
cloak
with
a
border
of
red
satin
flames.
He
brought
his
galley
in
alongside
the
Cinnamon
Wind,
raised
his
oars,
and
shouted
that
he
was
coming
aboard.
As
his
crossbowmen
and
Kojja
Mo’s
archers
eyed
each
other
across
the
narrow
span
of
water,
he
crossed
over
with
half
a
dozen
knights,
gave
Quhuru
Mo
a
nod,
and
asked
to
see
his
holds.
Father
and
daughter
conferred
briefly,
then
agreed.

“My
apologies,”
the
captain
said
when
his
inspection
was
complete.
“It
grieves
me
that
honest
men
must
suffer
such
discourtesy,
but
sooner
that
than
ironmen
in
Oldtown.
Only
a
fortnight
ago
some
of
those
bloody
bastards
captured
a
Tyroshi
merchantman
in
the
straits.
They
killed
her
crew,
donned
their
clothes,
and
used
the
dyes
they
found
to
color
their
whiskers
half
a
hundred
colors.
Once
inside
the
walls
they
meant
to
set
the
port
ablaze
and
open
a
gate
from
within
whilst
we
fought
the
fire.
Might
have
worked,
but
they
ran
afoul
of
the
Lady
of
the
Tower,
and
her
oarsmaster
has
a
Tyroshi
wife.
When
he
saw
all
the
green
and
purple
beards
he
hailed
them
in
the
tongue
of
Tyrosh,
and
not
one
of
them
had
the
words
to
hail
him
back.”

Sam
was
aghast.
“They
cannot
mean
to
raid
Oldtown.”

The
captain
of
the
Huntress
gave
him
a
curious
look.
“These
are
no
mere
reavers.
The
ironmen
have
always
raided
where
they
could.
They
would
strike
sudden
from
the
sea,
carry
off
some
gold
and
girls,
and
sail
away,
but
there
were
seldom
more
than
one
or
two
longships,
and
never
more
than
half
a
dozen.
Hundreds
of
their
ships
afflict
us
now,
sailing
out
of
the
Shield
Islands
and
some
of
the
rocks
around
the
Arbor.
They
have
taken
Stonecrab
Cay,
the
Isle
of
Pigs,
and
the
Mermaid’s
Palace,
and
there
are
other
nests
on
Horseshoe
Rock
and
Bastard’s
Cradle.
Without
Lord
Redwyne’s
fleet,
we
lack
the
ships
to
come
to
grips
with
them.”

“What
is
Lord
Hightower
doing?”
Sam
blurted.
“My
father
always
said
he
was
as
wealthy
as
the
Lannisters,
and
could
command
thrice
as
many
swords
as
any
of
Highgarden’s
other
bannermen.”

“More,
if
he
sweeps
the
cobblestones,”
the
captain
said,
“but
swords
are
no
good
against
the
ironmen,
unless
the
men
who
wield
them
know
how
to
walk
on
water.”

“The
Hightower
must
be
doing
something.”

“To
be
sure.
Lord
Leyton’s
locked
atop
his
tower
with
the
Mad
Maid,
consulting
books
of
spells.
Might
be
he’ll
raise
an
army
from
the
deeps.
Or
not.
Baelor’s
building
galleys,
Gunthor
has
charge
of
the
harbor,
Garth
is
training
new
recruits,
and
Humfrey’s
gone
to
Lys
to
hire
sellsails.
If
he
can
winkle
a
proper
fleet
out
of
his
whore
of
a
sister,
we
can
start
paying
back
the
ironmen
with
some
of
their
own
coin.
Till
then,
the
best
we
can
do
is
guard
the
sound
and
wait
for
the
bitch
queen
in
King’s
Landing
to
let
Lord
Paxter
off
his
leash.”

The
bitterness
of
the
captain’s
final
words
shocked
Sam
as
much
as
the
things
he
said.
If
King’s
Landing
loses
Oldtown
and
the
Arbor,
the
whole
realm
will
fall
to
pieces,
he
thought
as
he
watched
the
Huntress
and
her
sisters
moving
off.

It
made
him
wonder
if
even
Horn
Hill
was
truly
safe.
The
Tarly
lands
lay
inland
amidst
thickly
wooded
foothills,
a
hundred
leagues
northeast
of
Oldtown
and
a
long
way
from
any
coast.
They
should
be
well
beyond
the
reach
of
ironmen
and
longships,
even
with
his
lord
father
off
fighting
in
the
riverlands
and
the
castle
lightly
held.
The
Young
Wolf
had
no
doubt
thought
the
same
was
true
of
Winterfell
until
the
night
that
Theon
Turncloak
scaled
his
walls.
Sam
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
he
might
have
brought
Gilly
and
her
babe
all
this
long
way
to
keep
them
out
of
harm,
only
to
abandon
them
in
the
midst
of
war.

He
wrestled
with
his
doubts
through
the
rest
of
the
voyage,
wondering
what
to
do.
He
could
keep
Gilly
with
him
in
Oldtown,
he
supposed.
The
city’s
walls
were
much
more
formidable
than
those
of
his
father’s
castle,
and
had
thousands
of
men
to
defend
them,
as
opposed
to
the
handful
Lord
Randyll
would
have
left
at
Horn
Hill
when
he
marched
to
Highgarden
to
answer
his
liege
lord’s
summons.
If
he
did,
though,
he
would
need
to
hide
her
somehow;
the
Citadel
did
not
permit
its
novices
to
keep
wives
or
paramours,
at
least
not
openly.
Besides,
if
I
stay
with
Gilly
very
much
longer,
how
will
I
ever
find
the
strength
to
leave
her?
He
had
to
leave
her,
or
desert.
I
said
the
words,
Sam
reminded
himself.
If
I
desert,
it
will
mean
my
head,
and
how
will
that
help
Gilly?

He
considered
begging
Kojja
Mo
and
her
father
to
take
the
wildling
girl
with
them
to
the
Summer
Isles.
That
path
had
its
perils
too,
however.
When
the
Cinnamon
Wind
left
Oldtown,
she
would
need
to
cross
the
Redwyne
Straits
again,
and
this
time
she
might
not
be
so
fortunate.
What
if
the
wind
died,
and
the
Summer
Islanders
found
themselves
becalmed?
If
the
tales
he’d
heard
were
true,
Gilly
would
be
carried
off
for
a
thrall
or
salt
wife,
and
the
babe
was
like
to
be
chucked
into
the
sea
as
a
nuisance.

It
has
to
be
Horn
Hill,
Sam
finally
decided.
Once
we
reach
Oldtown
I’ll
hire
a
wagon
and
some
horses
and
take
her
there
myself.
That
way
he
could
make
certain
of
the
castle
and
its
garrison,
and
if
any
part
of
what
he
saw
or
heard
gave
him
pause,
he
could
just
turn
around
and
bring
Gilly
back
to
Oldtown.

They
reached
Oldtown
on
a
cold
damp
morning,
when
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
the
beacon
of
the
Hightower
was
the
only
part
of
the
city
to
be
seen.
A
boom
stretched
across
the
harbor,
linking
two
dozen
rotted
hulks.
Just
behind
it
stood
a
line
of
warships,
anchored
by
three
big
dromonds
and
Lord
Hightower’s
towering
four-decked
banner
ship,
the
Honor
of
Oldtown.
Once
again
the
Cinnamon
Wind
had
to
submit
to
inspection.
This
time
it
was
Lord
Leyton’s
son
Gunthor
who
came
aboard,
in
a
cloth-of-silver
cloak
and
a
suit
of
grey
enameled
scales.
Ser
Gunthor
had
studied
at
the
Citadel
for
several
years
and
spoke
the
Summer
Tongue,
so
he
and
Qurulu
Mo
adjourned
to
the
captain’s
cabin
for
a
privy
conference.

Sam
used
the
time
to
explain
his
plans
to
Gilly.
“First
the
Citadel,
to
present
Jon’s
letters
and
tell
them
of
Maester
Aemon’s
death.
I
expect
the
archmaesters
will
send
a
cart
for
his
body.
Then
I
will
arrange
for
horses
and
a
wagon
to
take
you
to
my
mother
at
Horn
Hill.
I
will
be
back
as
soon
as
I
can,
but
it
may
not
be
until
the
morrow.”

“The
morrow,”
she
repeated,
and
gave
him
a
kiss
for
luck.

At
length
Ser
Gunthor
reemerged
and
gave
the
signal
for
the
chain
to
be
opened
so
the
Cinnamon
Wind
could
slip
through
the
boom
to
dock.
Sam
joined
Kojja
Mo
and
three
of
her
archers
near
the
gangplank
as
the
swan
ship
was
tying
up,
the
Summer
Islanders
resplendent
in
the
feathered
cloaks
they
only
wore
ashore.
He
felt
a
shabby
thing
beside
them
in
his
baggy
blacks,
faded
cloak,
and
salt-stained
boots.
“How
long
will
you
remain
in
port?”

“Two
days,
ten
days,
who
can
say?
However
long
it
takes
to
empty
our
holds
and
fill
them
again.”
Kojja
grinned.
“My
father
must
visit
the
grey
maesters
as
well.
He
has
books
to
sell.”

“Can
Gilly
stay
aboard
till
I
return?”

“Gilly
can
stay
as
long
as
she
likes.”
She
poked
Sam
in
the
belly
with
a
finger.
“She
does
not
eat
so
much
as
some.”

“I’m
not
so
fat
as
I
was
before,”
Sam
said
defensively.
The
passage
south
had
seen
to
that.
All
those
watches,
and
nothing
to
eat
but
fruit
and
fish.
Summer
Islanders
loved
fruit
and
fish.

Sam
followed
the
archers
across
the
plank,
but
once
ashore
they
parted
company
and
went
their
separate
ways.
He
hoped
he
still
remembered
the
way
to
the
Citadel.
Oldtown
was
a
maze,
and
he
had
no
time
for
getting
lost.

The
day
was
damp,
so
the
cobblestones
were
wet
and
slippery
underfoot,
the
alleys
shrouded
in
mist
and
mystery.
Sam
avoided
them
as
best
he
could
and
stayed
on
the
river
road
that
wound
along
beside
the
Honeywine
through
the
heart
of
the
old
city.
It
felt
good
to
have
solid
ground
beneath
his
feet
again
instead
of
a
rolling
deck,
but
the
walk
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
all
the
same.
He
could
feel
eyes
on
him,
peering
down
from
balconies
and
windows,
watching
him
from
the
darkened
doorways.
On
the
Cinnamon
Wind
he
had
known
every
face.
Here,
everywhere
he
turned
he
saw
another
stranger.
Even
worse
was
the
thought
of
being
seen
by
someone
who
knew
him.
Lord
Randyll
Tarly
was
known
in
Oldtown,
but
little
loved.
Sam
did
not
know
which
would
be
worse:
to
be
recognized
by
one
of
his
lord
father’s
enemies
or
by
one
of
his
friends.
He
pulled
his
cloak
up
and
quickened
his
pace.

The
gates
of
the
Citadel
were
flanked
by
a
pair
of
towering
green
sphinxes
with
the
bodies
of
lions,
the
wings
of
eagles,
and
the
tails
of
serpents.
One
had
a
man’s
face,
one
a
woman’s.
Just
beyond
stood
Scribe’s
Hearth,
where
Oldtowners
came
in
search
of
acolytes
to
write
their
wills
and
read
their
letters.
Half
a
dozen
bored
scribes
sat
in
open
stalls,
waiting
for
some
custom.
At
other
stalls
books
were
being
bought
and
sold.
Sam
stopped
at
one
that
offered
maps,
and
looked
over
a
hand-drawn
map
of
Citadel
to
ascertain
the
shortest
way
to
the
Seneschal’s
Court.

The
path
divided
where
the
statue
of
King
Daeron
the
First
sat
astride
his
tall
stone
horse,
his
sword
lifted
toward
Dorne.
A
seagull
was
perched
on
the
Young
Dragon’s
head,
and
two
more
on
the
blade.
Sam
took
the
left
fork,
which
ran
beside
the
river.
At
the
Weeping
Dock,
he
watched
two
acolytes
help
an
old
man
into
a
boat
for
the
short
voyage
to
the
Bloody
Isle.
A
young
mother
climbed
in
after
him,
a
babe
not
much
older
than
Gilly’s
squalling
in
her
arms.
Beneath
the
dock,
some
cook’s
boys
waded
in
the
shallows,
gathering
frogs.
A
stream
of
pink-cheeked
novices
hurried
by
him
toward
the
septry.
I
should
have
come
here
when
I
was
their
age,
Sam
thought.
If
I
had
run
off
and
taken
a
false
name,
I
could
have
disappeared
amongst
the
other
novices.
Father
could
have
pretended
that
Dickon
was
his
only
son.
I
doubt
he
would
even
have
troubled
to
search
for
me,
unless
I
took
a
mule
to
ride.
Then
he
would
have
hunted
me
down,
but
only
for
the
mule.

Outside
the
Seneschal’s
Court,
the
rectors
were
locking
an
older
novice
into
the
stocks.
“Stealing
food
from
the
kitchens,”
one
explained
to
the
acolytes
who
were
waiting
to
pelt
the
captive
with
rotting
vegetables.
They
all
gave
Sam
curious
looks
as
he
strode
past,
his
black
cloak
billowing
behind
him
like
a
sail.

Beyond
the
doors
he
found
a
hall
with
a
stone
floor
and
high,
arched
windows.
At
the
far
end
a
man
with
a
pinched
face
sat
upon
a
raised
dais,
scratching
in
a
ledger
with
a
quill.
Though
the
man
was
clad
in
a
maester’s
robe,
there
was
no
chain
about
his
neck.
Sam
cleared
his
throat.
“Good
morrow.”

The
man
glanced
up
and
did
not
appear
to
approve
of
what
he
saw.
“You
smell
of
novice.”

“I
hope
to
be
one
soon.”
Sam
drew
out
the
letters
Jon
Snow
had
given
him.
“I
came
from
the
Wall
with
Maester
Aemon,
but
he
died
during
the
voyage.
If
I
could
speak
with
the
Seneschal...”

“Your
name?”

“Samwell.
Samwell
Tarly.”

The
man
wrote
the
name
in
his
ledger
and
waved
his
quill
at
a
bench
along
the
wall.
“Sit.
You’ll
be
called
when
wanted.”

Sam
took
a
seat
on
the
bench.

Others
came
and
went.
Some
delivered
messages
and
took
their
leave.
Some
spoke
to
the
man
on
the
dais
and
were
sent
through
the
door
behind
him
and
up
a
turnpike
stair.
Some
joined
Sam
on
the
benches,
waiting
for
their
names
to
be
called.
A
few
of
those
who
were
summoned
had
come
in
after
him,
he
was
almost
certain.
After
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
that
happened,
he
rose
and
crossed
the
room
again.
“How
much
longer
will
it
be?”

“The
Seneschal
is
an
important
man.”

“I
came
all
the
way
from
the
Wall.”

“Then
you
will
have
no
trouble
going
a
bit
farther.”
He
waved
his
quill.
“To
that
bench
just
there,
beneath
the
window.”

Sam
returned
to
the
bench.
Another
hour
passed.
Others
entered,
spoke
to
the
man
on
the
dais,
waited
a
few
moments,
and
were
ushered
onward.
The
gatekeeper
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
Sam
in
all
that
time.
The
fog
outside
grew
thinner
as
the
day
wore
on,
and
pale
sunlight
slanted
down
through
the
windows.
He
found
himself
watching
dust
motes
dance
in
the
light.
A
yawn
escaped
him,
then
another.
He
picked
at
a
broken
blister
on
his
palm,
then
leaned
his
head
back
and
closed
his
eyes.

He
must
have
drowsed.
The
next
he
knew,
the
man
behind
the
dais
was
calling
out
a
name.
Sam
came
lurching
to
his
feet,
then
sat
back
down
again
when
he
realized
it
was
not
his
name.

“You
need
to
slip
Lorcas
a
penny,
or
you’ll
be
waiting
here
three
days,”
a
voice
beside
him
said.
“What
brings
the
Night’s
Watch
to
the
Citadel?”

The
speaker
was
a
slim,
slight,
comely
youth,
clad
in
doeskin
breeches
and
a
snug
green
brigandine
with
iron
studs.
He
had
skin
the
color
of
a
light
brown
ale
and
a
cap
of
tight
black
curls
that
came
to
a
widow’s
peak
above
his
big
black
eyes.
“The
Lord
Commander
is
restoring
the
abandoned
castles,”
Sam
explained.
“We
need
more
maesters,
for
the
ravens...
did
you
say,
a
penny?”

“A
penny
will
serve.
For
a
silver
stag
Lorcas
will
carry
you
up
to
the
Seneschal
on
his
back.
He
has
been
fifty
years
an
acolyte.
He
hates
novices,
particularly
novices
of
noble
birth.”

“How
could
you
tell
I
was
of
noble
birth?”

“The
same
way
you
can
tell
that
I’m
half
Dornish.”
The
statement
was
delivered
with
a
smile,
in
a
soft
Dornish
drawl.

Sam
fumbled
for
a
penny.
“Are
you
a
novice?”

“An
acolyte.
Alleras,
by
some
called
Sphinx.”

The
name
gave
Sam
a
jolt.
“The
sphinx
is
the
riddle,
not
the
riddler,”
he
blurted.
“Do
you
know
what
that
means?”

“No.
Is
it
a
riddle?”

“I
wish
I
knew.
I’m
Samwell
Tarly.
Sam.”

“Well
met.
And
what
business
does
Samwell
Tarly
have
with
Archmaester
Theobald?”

“Is
he
the
Seneschal?”
said
Sam,
confused.
“Maester
Aemon
said
his
name
was
Norren.”

“Not
for
the
past
two
turns.
There
is
a
new
one
every
year.
They
fill
the
office
by
lot
from
amongst
the
archmaesters,
most
of
whom
regard
it
as
a
thankless
task
that
takes
them
away
from
their
true
work.
This
year
the
black
stone
was
drawn
by
Archmaester
Walgrave,
but
Walgrave’s
wits
are
prone
to
wander,
so
Theobald
stepped
up
and
said
he’d
serve
his
term.
He’s
a
gruff
man,
but
a
good
one.
Did
you
say
Maester
Aemon?”

“Aye.”

“Aemon
Targaryen?”

“Once.
Most
just
called
him
Maester
Aemon.
He
died
during
our
voyage
south.
How
is
it
that
you
know
of
him?”

“How
not?
He
was
more
than
just
the
oldest
living
maester.
He
was
the
oldest
man
in
Westeros,
and
lived
through
more
history
than
Archmaester
Perestan
has
ever
learned.
He
could
have
told
us
much
and
more
about
his
father’s
reign,
and
his
uncle’s.
How
old
was
he,
do
you
know?”

“One
hundred
and
two.”

“What
was
he
doing
at
sea,
at
his
age?”

Sam
chewed
on
the
question
for
a
moment,
wondering
how
much
he
ought
to
say.
The
sphinx
is
the
riddle,
not
the
riddler.
Could
Maester
Aemon
have
meant
this
Sphinx?
It
seemed
unlikely.
“Lord
Commander
Snow
sent
him
away
to
save
his
life,”
he
began,
hesitantly.
He
spoke
awkwardly
of
King
Stannis
and
Melisandre
of
Asshai,
intending
to
stop
at
that,
but
one
thing
led
to
another
and
he
found
himself
speaking
of
Mance
Rayder
and
his
wildlings,
king’s
blood
and
dragons,
and
before
he
knew
what
was
happening,
all
the
rest
came
spilling
out;
the
wights
at
the
Fist
of
First
Men,
the
Other
on
his
dead
horse,
the
murder
of
the
Old
Bear
at
Craster’s
Keep,
Gilly
and
their
flight,
Whitetree
and
Small
Paul,
Coldhands
and
the
ravens,
Jon’s
becoming
lord
commander,
the
Blackbird,
Dareon,
Braavos,
the
dragons
Xhondo
saw
in
Qarth,
the
Cinnamon
Wind
and
all
that
Maester
Aemon
whispered
toward
the
end.
He
held
back
only
the
secrets
that
he
was
sworn
to
keep,
about
Bran
Stark
and
his
companions
and
the
babes
Jon
Snow
had
swapped.
“Daenerys
is
the
only
hope,”
he
concluded.
“Aemon
said
the
Citadel
must
send
her
a
maester
at
once,
to
bring
her
home
to
Westeros
before
it
is
too
late.”

Alleras
listened
intently.
He
blinked
from
time
to
time,
but
he
never
laughed
and
never
interrupted.
When
Sam
was
done
he
touched
him
lightly
on
the
forearm
with
a
slim
brown
hand
and
said,
“Save
your
penny,
Sam.
Theobald
will
not
believe
half
of
that,
but
there
are
those
who
might.
Will
you
come
with
me?”

“Where?”

“To
speak
with
an
archmaester.”

You
must
tell
them,
Sam,
Maester
Aemon
had
said.
You
must
tell
the
archmaesters.
“Very
well.”
He
could
always
return
to
the
Seneschal
on
the
morrow,
with
a
penny
in
his
hand.
“How
far
do
we
have
to
go?”

“Not
far.
The
Isle
of
Ravens.”

They
did
not
need
a
boat
to
reach
the
Isle
of
Ravens;
a
weathered
wooden
drawbridge
linked
it
to
the
eastern
bank.
“The
Ravenry
is
the
oldest
building
at
the
Citadel,”
Alleras
told
him,
as
they
crossed
over
the
slow-flowing
waters
of
the
Honeywine.
“In
the
Age
of
Heroes
it
was
supposedly
the
stronghold
of
a
pirate
lord
who
sat
here
robbing
ships
as
they
came
down
the
river.”

Moss
and
creeping
vines
covered
the
walls,
Sam
saw,
and
ravens
walked
its
battlements
in
place
of
archers.
The
drawbridge
had
not
been
raised
in
living
memory.

It
was
cool
and
dim
inside
the
castle
walls.
An
ancient
weirwood
filled
the
yard,
as
it
had
since
these
stones
had
first
been
raised.
The
carved
face
on
its
trunk
was
grown
over
by
the
same
purple
moss
that
hung
heavy
from
the
tree’s
pale
limbs.
Half
of
the
branches
seemed
dead,
but
elsewhere
a
few
red
leaves
still
rustled,
and
it
was
there
the
ravens
liked
to
perch.
The
tree
was
full
of
them,
and
there
were
more
in
the
arched
windows
overhead,
all
around
the
yard.
The
ground
was
speckled
by
their
droppings.
As
they
crossed
the
yard,
one
flapped
overhead
and
he
heard
the
others
quorking
to
each
other.
“Archmaester
Walgrave
has
his
chambers
in
the
west
tower,
below
the
white
rookery,”
Alleras
told
him.
“The
white
ravens
and
the
black
ones
quarrel
like
Dornishmen
and
Marchers,
so
they
keep
them
apart.”

“Will
Archmaester
Walgrave
understand
what
I
am
telling
him?”
wondered
Sam.
“You
said
his
wits
were
prone
to
wander.”

“He
has
good
days
and
bad
ones,”
said
Alleras,
“but
it
is
not
Walgrave
you’re
going
to
see.”
He
opened
the
door
to
the
north
tower
and
began
to
climb.
Sam
clambered
up
the
steps
behind
him.
There
were
flutterings
and
mutterings
from
above,
and
here
and
there
an
angry
scream,
as
the
ravens
complained
of
being
woken.

At
the
top
of
the
steps,
a
pale
blond
youth
about
Sam’s
age
sat
outside
a
door
of
oak
and
iron,
staring
intently
into
a
candle
flame
with
his
right
eye.
His
left
was
hidden
beneath
a
fall
of
ash
blond
hair.
“What
are
you
looking
for?”
Alleras
asked
him.
“Your
destiny?
Your
death?”

The
blond
youth
turned
from
the
candle,
blinking.
“Naked
women,”
he
said.
“Who’s
this
now?”

“Samwell.
A
new
novice,
come
to
see
the
Mage.”

“The
Citadel
is
not
what
it
was,”
complained
the
blond.
“They
will
take
anything
these
days.
Dusky
dogs
and
Dornishmen,
pig
boys,
cripples,
cretins,
and
now
a
black-clad
whale.
And
here
I
thought
leviathans
were
grey.”
A
half
cape
striped
in
green
and
gold
draped
one
shoulder.
He
was
very
handsome,
though
his
eyes
were
sly
and
his
mouth
cruel.

Sam
knew
him.
“Leo
Tyrell.”
Saying
the
name
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
still
a
boy
of
seven,
about
to
wet
his
smallclothes.
“I
am
Sam,
from
Horn
Hill.
Lord
Randyll
Tarly’s
son.”

“Truly?”
Leo
gave
him
another
look.
“I
suppose
you
are.
Your
father
told
us
all
that
you
were
dead.
Or
was
it
only
that
he
wished
you
were?”
He
grinned.
“Are
you
still
a
craven?”

“No,”
lied
Sam.
Jon
had
made
it
a
command.
“I
went
beyond
the
Wall
and
fought
in
battles.
They
call
me
Sam
the
Slayer.”
He
did
not
know
why
he
said
it.
The
words
just
tumbled
out.

Leo
laughed,
but
before
he
could
reply
the
door
behind
him
opened.
“Get
in
here,
Slayer,”
growled
the
man
in
the
doorway.
“And
you,
Sphinx.
Now.”

“Sam,”
said
Alleras,
“this
is
Archmaester
Marwyn.”

Marwyn
wore
a
chain
of
many
metals
around
his
bull’s
neck.
Save
for
that,
he
looked
more
like
a
dockside
thug
than
a
maester.
His
head
was
too
big
for
his
body,
and
the
way
it
thrust
forward
from
his
shoulders,
together
with
that
slab
of
jaw,
made
him
look
as
if
he
were
about
to
tear
off
someone’s
head.
Though
short
and
squat,
he
was
heavy
in
the
chest
and
shoulders,
with
a
round,
rock-hard
ale
belly
straining
at
the
laces
of
the
leather
jerkin
he
wore
in
place
of
robes.
Bristly
white
hair
sprouted
from
his
ears
and
nostrils.
His
brow
beetled,
his
nose
had
been
broken
more
than
once,
and
sourleaf
had
stained
his
teeth
a
mottled
red.
He
had
the
biggest
hands
that
Sam
had
ever
seen.

When
Sam
hesitated,
one
of
those
hands
grabbed
him
by
the
arm
and
yanked
him
through
the
door.
The
room
beyond
was
large
and
round.
Books
and
scrolls
were
everywhere,
strewn
across
the
tables
and
stacked
up
on
the
floor
in
piles
four
feet
high.
Faded
tapestries
and
ragged
maps
covered
the
stone
walls.
A
fire
was
burning
in
the
hearth,
beneath
a
copper
kettle.
Whatever
was
inside
of
it
smelled
burned.
Aside
from
that,
the
only
light
came
from
a
tall
black
candle
in
the
center
of
the
room.

The
candle
was
unpleasantly
bright.
There
was
something
queer
about
it.
The
flame
did
not
flicker,
even
when
Archmaester
Marwyn
closed
the
door
so
hard
that
papers
blew
off
a
nearby
table.
The
light
did
something
strange
to
colors
too.
Whites
were
bright
as
fresh-fallen
snow,
yellow
shone
like
gold,
reds
turned
to
flame,
but
the
shadows
were
so
black
they
looked
like
holes
in
the
world.
Sam
found
himself
staring.
The
candle
itself
was
three
feet
tall
and
slender
as
a
sword,
ridged
and
twisted,
glittering
black.
“Is
that...?”

“...obsidian,”
said
the
other
man
in
the
room,
a
pale,
fleshy,
pasty-faced
young
fellow
with
round
shoulders,
soft
hands,
close-set
eyes,
and
food
stains
on
his
robes.

“Call
it
dragonglass.”
Archmaester
Marwyn
glanced
at
the
candle
for
a
moment.
“It
burns
but
is
not
consumed.”

“What
feeds
the
flame?”
asked
Sam.

“What
feeds
a
dragon’s
fire?”
Marwyn
seated
himself
upon
a
stool.
“All
Valyrian
sorcery
was
rooted
in
blood
or
fire.
The
sorcerers
of
the
Freehold
could
see
across
mountains,
seas,
and
deserts
with
one
of
these
glass
candles.
They
could
enter
a
man’s
dreams
and
give
him
visions,
and
speak
to
one
another
half
a
world
apart,
seated
before
their
candles.
Do
you
think
that
might
be
useful,
Slayer?”

“We
would
have
no
more
need
of
ravens.”

“Only
after
battles.”
The
archmaester
peeled
a
sourleaf
off
a
bale,
shoved
it
in
his
mouth,
and
began
to
chew
it.
“Tell
me
all
you
told
our
Dornish
sphinx.
I
know
much
of
it
and
more,
but
some
small
parts
may
have
escaped
my
notice.”

He
was
not
a
man
to
be
refused.
Sam
hesitated
a
moment,
then
told
his
tale
again
as
Marywn,
Alleras,
and
the
other
novice
listened.
“Maester
Aemon
believed
that
Daenerys
Targaryen
was
the
fulfillment
of
a
prophecy...
her,
not
Stannis,
nor
Prince
Rhaegar,
nor
the
princeling
whose
head
was
dashed
against
the
wall.”

“Born
amidst
salt
and
smoke,
beneath
a
bleeding
star.
I
know
the
prophecy.”
Marwyn
turned
his
head
and
spat
a
gob
of
red
phlegm
onto
the
floor.
“Not
that
I
would
trust
it.
Gorghan
of
Old
Ghis
once
wrote
that
a
prophecy
is
like
a
treacherous
woman.
She
takes
your
member
in
her
mouth,
and
you
moan
with
the
pleasure
of
it
and
think,
how
sweet,
how
fine,
how
good
this
is...
and
then
her
teeth
snap
shut
and
your
moans
turn
to
screams.
That
is
the
nature
of
prophecy,
said
Gorghan.
Prophecy
will
bite
your
prick
off
every
time.”
He
chewed
a
bit.
“Still...”

Alleras
stepped
up
next
to
Sam.
“Aemon
would
have
gone
to
her
if
he
had
the
strength.
He
wanted
us
to
send
a
maester
to
her,
to
counsel
her
and
protect
her
and
fetch
her
safely
home.”

“Did
he?”
Archmaester
Marwyn
shrugged.
“Perhaps
it’s
good
that
he
died
before
he
got
to
Oldtown.
Elsewise
the
grey
sheep
might
have
had
to
kill
him,
and
that
would
have
made
the
poor
old
dears
wring
their
wrinkled
hands.”

“Kill
him?”
Sam
said,
shocked.
“Why?”

“If
I
tell
you,
they
may
need
to
kill
you
too.”
Marywn
smiled
a
ghastly
smile,
the
juice
of
the
sourleaf
running
red
between
his
teeth.
“Who
do
you
think
killed
all
the
dragons
the
last
time
around?
Gallant
dragonslayers
armed
with
swords?”
He
spat.
“The
world
the
Citadel
is
building
has
no
place
in
it
for
sorcery
or
prophecy
or
glass
candles,
much
less
for
dragons.
Ask
yourself
why
Aemon
Targaryen
was
allowed
to
waste
his
life
upon
the
Wall,
when
by
rights
he
should
have
been
raised
to
archmaester.
His
blood
was
why.
He
could
not
be
trusted.
No
more
than
I
can.”

“What
will
you
do?”
asked
Alleras,
the
Sphinx.

“Get
myself
to
Slaver’s
Bay,
in
Aemon’s
place.
The
swan
ship
that
delivered
Slayer
should
serve
my
needs
well
enough.
The
grey
sheep
will
send
their
man
on
a
galley,
I
don’t
doubt.
With
fair
winds
I
should
reach
her
first.”
Marwyn
glanced
at
Sam
again,
and
frowned.
“You...
you
should
stay
and
forge
your
chain.
If
I
were
you,
I
would
do
it
quickly.
A
time
will
come
when
you’ll
be
needed
on
the
Wall.”
He
turned
to
the
pasty-faced
novice.
“Find
Slayer
a
dry
cell.
He’ll
sleep
here,
and
help
you
tend
the
ravens.”

“B-b-but,”
Sam
sputtered,
“the
other
archmaesters...
the
Seneschal...
what
should
I
tell
them?”

“Tell
them
how
wise
and
good
they
are.
Tell
them
that
Aemon
commanded
you
to
put
yourself
into
their
hands.
Tell
them
that
you
have
always
dreamed
that
one
day
you
might
be
allowed
to
wear
the
chain
and
serve
the
greater
good,
that
service
is
the
highest
honor,
and
obedience
the
highest
virtue.
But
say
nothing
of
prophecies
or
dragons,
unless
you
fancy
poison
in
your
porridge.”
Marwyn
snatched
a
stained
leather
cloak
off
a
peg
near
the
door
and
tied
it
tight.
“Sphinx,
look
after
this
one.”

“I
will,”
Alleras
answered,
but
the
archmaester
was
already
gone.
They
heard
his
boots
stomping
down
the
steps.

“Where
has
he
gone?”
asked
Sam,
bewildered.

“To
the
docks.
The
Mage
is
not
a
man
who
believes
in
wasting
time.”
Alleras
smiled.
“I
have
a
confession.
Ours
was
no
chance
encounter,
Sam.
The
Mage
sent
me
to
snatch
you
up
before
you
spoke
to
Theobald.
He
knew
that
you
were
coming.”

“How?”

Alleras
nodded
at
the
glass
candle.

Sam
stared
at
the
strange
pale
flame
for
a
moment,
then
blinked
and
looked
away.
Outside
the
window
it
was
growing
dark.

“There’s
an
empty
sleeping
cell
under
mine
in
the
west
tower,
with
steps
that
lead
right
up
to
Walgrave’s
chambers,”
said
the
pasty-faced
youth.
“If
you
don’t
mind
the
ravens
quorking,
there’s
a
good
view
of
the
Honeywine.
Will
that
serve?”

“I
suppose.”
He
had
to
sleep
somewhere.

“I
will
bring
you
some
woolen
coverlets.
Stone
walls
turn
cold
at
night,
even
here.”

“My
thanks.”
There
was
something
about
the
pale,
soft
youth
that
he
misliked,
but
he
did
not
want
to
seem
discourteous,
so
he
added,
“My
name’s
not
Slayer,
truly.
I’m
Sam.
Samwell
Tarly.”

“I’m
Pate,”
the
other
said,
“like
the
pig
boy.”





MEANWHILE,
BACK
ON
THE
WALL...

“Hey,
wait
a
minute!”
some
of
you
may
be
saying
about
now.
“Wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute!
Where’s
Dany
and
the
dragons?
Where’s
Tyrion?
We
hardly
saw
Jon
Snow.
That
can’t
be
all
of
it...”

Well,
no.
There’s
more
to
come.
Another
book
as
big
as
this
one.

I
did
not
forget
to
write
about
the
other
characters.
Far
from
it.
I
wrote
lots
about
them.
Pages
and
pages
and
pages.
Chapters
and
more
chapters.
I
was
still
writing
when
it
dawned
on
me
that
the
book
had
become
too
big
to
publish
in
a
single
volume...
and
I
wasn’t
close
to
finished
yet.
To
tell
all
of
the
story
that
I
wanted
to
tell,
I
was
going
to
have
to
cut
the
book
in
two.

The
simplest
way
to
do
that
would
have
been
to
take
what
I
had,
chop
it
in
half
around
the
middle,
and
end
with
“To
Be
Continued.”
The
more
I
thought
about
that,
however,
the
more
I
felt
that
the
readers
would
be
better
served
by
a
book
that
told
all
the
story
for
half
the
characters,
rather
than
half
the
story
for
all
the
characters.
So
that’s
the
route
I
chose
to
take.

Tyrion,
Jon,
Dany,
Stannis
and
Melisandre,
Davos
Seaworth,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
characters
you
love
or
love
to
hate
will
be
along
next
year
(I
devoutly
hope)
in
A
Dance
with
Dragons,
which
will
focus
on
events
along
the
Wall
and
across
the
sea,
just
as
the
present
book
focused
on
King’s
Landing.

BRAN

The
oldest
were
men
grown,
seventeen
and
eighteen
years
from
the
day
of
their
naming.
One
was
past
twenty.
Most
were
younger,
sixteen
or
less.

Bran
watched
them
from
the
balcony
of
Maester
Luwin’s
turret,
listening
to
them
grunt
and
strain
and
curse
as
they
swung
their
staves
and
wooden
swords.
The
yard
was
alive
to
the
clack
of
wood
on
wood,
punctuated
all
too
often
by
thwacks
and
yowls
of
pain
when
a
blow
struck
leather
or
flesh.
Ser
Rodrik
strode
among
the
boys,
face
reddening
beneath
his
white
whiskers,
muttering
at
them
one
and
all.
Bran
had
never
seen
the
old
knight
look
so
fierce.
“No,”
he
kept
saying.
“No.
No.
No.”

“They
don’t
fight
very
well,”
Bran
said
dubiously.
He
scratched
Summer
idly
behind
the
ears
as
the
direwolf
tore
at
a
haunch
of
meat.
Bones
crunched
between
his
teeth.

“For
a
certainty,”
Maester
Luwin
agreed
with
a
deep
sigh.
The
maester
was
peering
through
his
big
Myrish
lens
tube,
measuring
shadows
and
noting
the
position
of
the
comet
that
hung
low
in
the
morning
sky.
“Yet
given
time…
Ser
Rodrik
has
the
truth
of
it,
we
need
men
to
walk
the
walls.
Your
lord
father
took
the
cream
of
his
guard
to
King’s
Landing,
and
your
brother
took
the
rest,
along
with
all
the
likely
lads
for
leagues
around.
Many
will
not
come
back
to
us,
and
we
must
needs
find
the
men
to
take
their
places.”

Bran
stared
resentfully
at
the
sweating
boys
below.
“If
I
still
had
my
legs,
I
could
beat
them
all.”
He
remembered
the
last
time
he’d
held
a
sword
in
his
hand,
when
the
king
had
come
to
Winterfell.
It
was
only
a
wooden
sword,
yet
he’d
knocked
Prince
Tommen
down
half
a
hundred
times.
“Ser
Rodrik
should
teach
me
to
use
a
poleaxe.
If
I
had
a
poleaxe
with
a
big
long
haft,
Hodor
could
be
my
legs.
We
could
be
a
knight
together.”

“I
think
that…
unlikely,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Bran,
when
a
man
fights,
his
arms
and
legs
and
thoughts
must
be
as
one.”

Below
in
the
yard,
Ser
Rodrik
was
yelling.
“You
fight
like
a
goose.
He
pecks
you
and
you
peck
him
harder.
Parry!
Block
the
blow.
Goose
fighting
will
not
suffice.
If
those
were
real
swords,
the
first
peck
would
take
your
arm
off!”
One
of
the
other
boys
laughed,
and
the
old
knight
rounded
on
him.
“You
laugh.
You.
Now
that
is
gall.
You
fight
like
a
hedgehog…”

“There
was
a
knight
once
who
couldn’t
see,”
Bran
said
stubbornly,
as
Ser
Rodrik
went
on
below.
“Old
Nan
told
me
about
him.
He
had
a
long
staff
with
blades
at
both
ends
and
he
could
spin
it
in
his
hands
and
chop
two
men
at
once.”

“Symeon
Star-Eyes,”
Luwin
said
as
he
marked
numbers
in
a
book.
“When
he
lost
his
eyes,
he
put
star
sapphires
in
the
empty
sockets,
or
so
the
singers
claim.
Bran,
that
is
only
a
story,
like
the
tales
of
Florian
the
Fool.
A
fable
from
the
Age
of
Heroes.”
The
maester
tsked.
“You
must
put
these
dreams
aside,
they
will
only
break
your
heart.”

The
mention
of
dreams
reminded
him.
“I
dreamed
about
the
crow
again
last
night.
The
one
with
three
eyes.
He
flew
into
my
bedchamber
and
told
me
to
come
with
him,
so
I
did.
We
went
down
to
the
crypts.
Father
was
there,
and
we
talked.
He
was
sad.”

“And
why
was
that?”
Luwin
peered
through
his
tube.

“It
was
something
to
do
about
Jon,
I
think.”
The
dream
had
been
deeply
disturbing,
more
so
than
any
of
the
other
crow
dreams.
“Hodor
won’t
go
down
into
the
crypts.”

The
maester
had
only
been
half
listening,
Bran
could
tell.
He
lifted
his
eye
from
the
tube,
blinking.
“Hodor
won’t…”

“Go
down
into
the
crypts.
When
I
woke,
I
told
him
to
take
me
down,
to
see
if
Father
was
truly
there.
At
first
he
didn’t
know
what
I
was
saying,
but
I
got
him
to
the
steps
by
telling
him
to
go
here
and
go
there,
only
then
he
wouldn’t
go
down.
He
just
stood
on
the
top
step
and
said
‘Hodor,’
like
he
was
scared
of
the
dark,
but
I
had
a
torch.
It
made
me
so
mad
I
almost
gave
him
a
swat
in
the
head,
like
Old
Nan
is
always
doing.”
He
saw
the
way
the
maester
was
frowning
and
hurriedly
added,
“I
didn’t,
though.”

“Good.
Hodor
is
a
man,
not
a
mule
to
be
beaten.”

“In
the
dream
I
flew
down
with
the
crow,
but
I
can’t
do
that
when
I’m
awake,”
Bran
explained.

“Why
would
you
want
to
go
down
to
the
crypts?”

“I
told
you.
To
look
for
Father.”

The
maester
tugged
at
the
chain
around
his
neck,
as
he
often
did
when
he
was
uncomfortable.
“Bran,
sweet
child,
one
day
Lord
Eddard
will
sit
below
in
stone,
beside
his
father
and
his
father’s
father
and
all
the
Starks
back
to
the
old
Kings
in
the
North…
but
that
will
not
be
for
many
years,
gods
be
good.
Your
father
is
a
prisoner
of
the
queen
in
King’s
Landing.
You
will
not
find
him
in
the
crypts.”

“He
was
there
last
night.
I
talked
to
him.”

“Stubborn
boy,”
the
maester
sighed,
setting
his
book
aside.
“Would
you
like
to
go
see?”

“I
can’t.
Hodor
won’t
go,
and
the
steps
are
too
narrow
and
twisty
for
Dancer.”

“I
believe
I
can
solve
that
difficulty.”

In
place
of
Hodor,
the
wildling
woman
Osha
was
summoned.
She
was
tall
and
tough
and
uncomplaining,
willing
to
go
wherever
she
was
commanded.
“I
lived
my
life
beyond
the
Wall,
a
hole
in
the
ground
won’t
fret
me
none,
m’lords,”
she
said.

“Summer,
come,”
Bran
called
as
she
lifted
him
in
wiry-strong
arms.
The
direwolf
left
his
bone
and
followed
as
Osha
carried
Bran
across
the
yard
and
down
the
spiral
steps
to
the
cold
vault
under
the
earth.
Maester
Luwin
went
ahead
with
a
torch.
Bran
did
not
even
mind—too
badly—that
she
carried
him
in
her
arms
and
not
on
her
back.
Ser
Rodrik
had
ordered
Osha’s
chain
struck
off,
since
she
had
served
faithfully
and
well
since
she
had
been
at
Winterfell.
She
still
wore
the
heavy
iron
shackles
around
her
ankles—a
sign
that
she
was
not
yet
wholly
trusted—but
they
did
not
hinder
her
sure
strides
down
the
steps.

Bran
could
not
recall
the
last
time
he
had
been
in
the
crypts.
It
had
been
before,
for
certain.
When
he
was
little,
he
used
to
play
down
here
with
Robb
and
Jon
and
his
sisters.

He
wished
they
were
here
now;
the
vault
might
not
have
seemed
so
dark
and
scary.
Summer
stalked
out
in
the
echoing
gloom,
then
stopped,
lifted
his
head,
and
sniffed
the
chill
dead
air.
He
bared
his
teeth
and
crept
backward,
eyes
glowing
golden
in
the
light
of
the
maester’s
torch.
Even
Osha,
hard
as
old
iron,
seemed
uncomfortable.
“Grim
folk,
by
the
look
of
them,”
she
said
as
she
eyed
the
long
row
of
granite
Starks
on
their
stone
thrones.

“They
were
the
Kings
of
Winter,”
Bran
whispered.
Somehow
it
felt
wrong
to
talk
too
loudly
in
this
place.

Osha
smiled.
“Winter’s
got
no
king.
If
you’d
seen
it,
you’d
know
that,
summer
boy.”

“They
were
the
Kings
in
the
North
for
thousands
of
years,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
lifting
the
torch
high
so
the
light
shone
on
the
stone
faces.
Some
were
hairy
and
bearded,
shaggy
men
fierce
as
the
wolves
that
crouched
by
their
feet.
Others
were
shaved
clean,
their
features
gaunt
and
sharp-edged
as
the
iron
longswords
across
their
laps.
“Hard
men
for
a
hard
time.
Come.”
He
strode
briskly
down
the
vault,
past
the
procession
of
stone
pillars
and
the
endless
carved
figures.
A
tongue
of
flame
trailed
back
from
the
upraised
torch
as
he
went.

The
vault
was
cavernous,
longer
than
Winterfell
itself,
and
Jon
had
told
him
once
that
there
were
other
levels
underneath,
vaults
even
deeper
and
darker
where
the
older
kings
were
buried.
It
would
not
do
to
lose
the
light.
Summer
refused
to
move
from
the
steps,
even
when
Osha
followed
the
torch,
Bran
in
her
arms.

“Do
you
recall
your
history,
Bran?”
the
maester
said
as
they
walked.
“Tell
Osha
who
they
were
and
what
they
did,
if
you
can.”

He
looked
at
the
passing
faces
and
the
tales
came
back
to
him.
The
maester
had
told
him
the
stories,
and
Old
Nan
had
made
them
come
alive.
“That
one
is
Jon
Stark.
When
the
sea
raiders
landed
in
the
east,
he
drove
them
out
and
built
the
castle
at
White
Harbor.
His
son
was
Rickard
Stark,
not
my
father’s
father
but
another
Rickard,
he
took
the
Neck
away
from
the
Marsh
King
and
married
his
daughter.
Theon
Stark’s
the
real
thin
one
with
the
long
hair
and
the
skinny
beard.
They
called
him
the
‘Hungry
Wolf,’
because
he
was
always
at
war.
That’s
a
Brandon,
the
tall
one
with
the
dreamy
face,
he
was
Brandon
the
Shipwright,
because
he
loved
the
sea.
His
tomb
is
empty.
He
tried
to
sail
west
across
the
Sunset
Sea
and
was
never
seen
again.
His
son
was
Brandon
the
Burner,
because
he
put
the
torch
to
all
his
father’s
ships
in
grief.
There’s
Rodrik
Stark,
who
won
Bear
Island
in
a
wrestling
match
and
gave
it
to
the
Mormonts.
And
that’s
Torrhen
Stark,
the
King
Who
Knelt.
He
was
the
last
King
in
the
North
and
the
first
Lord
of
Winterfell,
after
he
yielded
to
Aegon
the
Conqueror.
Oh,
there,
he’s
Cregan
Stark.
He
fought
with
Prince
Aemon
once,
and
the
Dragonknight
said
he’d
never
faced
a
finer
swordsman.”
They
were
almost
at
the
end
now,
and
Bran
felt
a
sadness
creeping
over
him.
“And
there’s
my
grandfather,
Lord
Rickard,
who
was
beheaded
by
Mad
King
Aerys.
His
daughter
Lyanna
and
his
son
Brandon
are
in
the
tombs
beside
him.
Not
me,
another
Brandon,
my
father’s
brother.
They’re
not
supposed
to
have
statues,
that’s
only
for
the
lords
and
the
kings,
but
my
father
loved
them
so
much
he
had
them
done.”

“The
maid’s
a
fair
one,”
Osha
said.

“Robert
was
betrothed
to
marry
her,
but
Prince
Rhaegar
carried
her
off
and
raped
her,”
Bran
explained.
“Robert
fought
a
war
to
win
her
back.
He
killed
Rhaegar
on
the
Trident
with
his
hammer,
but
Lyanna
died
and
he
never
got
her
back
at
all.”

“A
sad
tale,”
said
Osha,
“but
those
empty
holes
are
sadder.”

“Lord
Eddard’s
tomb,
for
when
his
time
comes,”
Maester
Luwin
said.
“Is
this
where
you
saw
your
father
in
your
dream,
Bran?”

“Yes.”
The
memory
made
him
shiver.
He
looked
around
the
vault
uneasily,
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
neck
bristling.
Had
he
heard
a
noise?
Was
there
someone
here?

Maester
Luwin
stepped
toward
the
open
sepulchre,
torch
in
hand.
“As
you
see,
he’s
not
here.
Nor
will
he
be,
for
many
a
year.
Dreams
are
only
dreams,
child.”
He
thrust
his
arm
into
the
blackness
inside
the
tomb,
as
into
the
mouth
of
some
great
beast.
“Do
you
see?
It’s
quite
empt—”

The
darkness
sprang
at
him,
snarling.

Bran
saw
eyes
like
green
fire,
a
flash
of
teeth,
fur
as
black
as
the
pit
around
them.
Maester
Luwin
yelled
and
threw
up
his
hands.
The
torch
went
flying
from
his
fingers,
caromed
off
the
stone
face
of
Brandon
Stark,
and
tumbled
to
the
statue’s
feet,
the
flames
licking
up
his
legs.
In
the
drunken
shifting
torchlight,
they
saw
Luwin
struggling
with
the
direwolf,
beating
at
his
muzzle
with
one
hand
while
the
jaws
closed
on
the
other.

“Summer!”
Bran
screamed.

And
Summer
came,
shooting
from
the
dimness
behind
them,
a
leaping
shadow.
He
slammed
into
Shaggydog
and
knocked
him
back,
and
the
two
direwolves
rolled
over
and
over
in
a
tangle
of
grey
and
black
fur,
snapping
and
biting
at
each
other,
while
Maester
Luwin
struggled
to
his
knees,
his
arm
torn
and
bloody.
Osha
propped
Bran
up
against
Lord
Rickard’s
stone
wolf
as
she
hurried
to
assist
the
maester.
In
the
light
of
the
guttering
torch,
shadow
wolves
twenty
feet
tall
fought
on
the
wall
and
roof.

“Shaggy,”
a
small
voice
called.
When
Bran
looked
up,
his
little
brother
was
standing
in
the
mouth
of
Father’s
tomb.
With
one
final
snap
at
Summer’s
face,
Shaggydog
broke
off
and
bounded
to
Rickon’s
side.
“You
let
my
father
be,”
Rickon
warned
Luwin.
“You
let
him
be.”

“Rickon,”
Bran
said
softly.
“Father’s
not
here.”

“Yes
he
is.
I
saw
him.”
Tears
glistened
on
Rickon’s
face.
“I
saw
him
last
night.”

“In
your
dream…?”

Rickon
nodded.
“You
leave
him.
You
leave
him
be.
He’s
coming
home
now,
like
he
promised.
He’s
coming
home.”

Bran
had
never
seen
Maester
Luwin
took
so
uncertain
before.
Blood
dripped
down
his
arm
where
Shaggydog
had
shredded
the
wool
of
his
sleeve
and
the
flesh
beneath.
“Osha,
the
torch,”
he
said,
biting
through
his
pain,
and
she
snatched
it
up
before
it
went
out.
Soot
stains
blackened
both
legs
of
his
uncle’s
likeness.
“That…
that
beast,”
Luwin
went
on,
“is
supposed
to
be
chained
up
in
the
kennels.”

Rickon
patted
Shaggydog’s
muzzle,
damp
with
blood.
“I
let
him
loose.
He
doesn’t
like
chains.”
He
licked
at
his
fingers.

“Rickon,”
Bran
said,
“would
you
like
to
come
with
me?”

“No.
I
like
it
here.”

“It’s
dark
here.
And
cold.”

“I’m
not
afraid.
I
have
to
wait
for
Father.”

“You
can
wait
with
me,”
Bran
said.
“We’ll
wait
together,
you
and
me
and
our
wolves.”
Both
of
the
direwolves
were
licking
wounds
now,
and
would
bear
close
watching.

“Bran,”
the
maester
said
firmly,
“I
know
you
mean
well,
but
Shaggydog
is
too
wild
to
run
loose.
I’m
the
third
man
he’s
savaged.
Give
him
the
freedom
of
the
castle
and
it’s
only
a
question
of
time
before
he
kills
someone.
The
truth
is
hard,
but
the
wolf
has
to
be
chained,
or…”
He
hesitated.

…or
killed,
Bran
thought,
but
what
he
said
was,
“He
was
not
made
for
chains.
We
will
wait
in
your
tower,
all
of
us.”

“That
is
quite
impossible,”
Maester
Luwin
said.

Osha
grinned.
“The
boy’s
the
lordling
here,
as
I
recall.”
She
handed
Luwin
back
his
torch
and
scooped
Bran
up
into
her
arms
again.
“The
maester’s
tower
it
is.”

“Will
you
come,
Rickon?”

His
brother
nodded.
“If
Shaggy
comes
too,”
he
said,
running
after
Osha
and
Bran,
and
there
was
nothing
Maester
Luwin
could
do
but
follow,
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
the
wolves.

Maester
Luwin’s
turret
was
so
cluttered
that
it
seemed
to
Bran
a
wonder
that
he
ever
found
anything.
Tottering
piles
of
books
covered
tables
and
chairs,
rows
of
stoppered
jars
lined
the
shelves,
candle
stubs
and
puddles
of
dried
wax
dotted
the
furniture,
the
bronze
Myrish
lens
tube
sat
on
a
tripod
by
the
terrace
door,
star
charts
hung
from
the
walls,
shadow
maps
lay
scattered
among
the
rushes,
papers,
quills,
and
pots
of
inks
were
everywhere,
and
all
of
it
was
spotted
with
droppings
from
the
ravens
in
the
rafters.
Their
strident
quorks
drifted
down
from
above
as
Osha
washed
and
cleaned
and
bandaged
the
maester’s
wounds,
under
Luwin’s
terse
instruction.
“This
is
folly,”
the
small
grey
man
said
while
she
dabbed
at
the
wolf
bites
with
a
stinging
ointment.
“I
agree
that
it
is
odd
that
both
you
boys
dreamed
the
same
dream,
yet
when
you
stop
to
consider
it,
it’s
only
natural.
You
miss
your
lord
father,
and
you
know
that
he
is
a
captive.
Fear
can
fever
a
man’s
mind
and
give
him
queer
thoughts.
Rickon
is
too
young
to
comprehend—”

“I’m
four
now,”
Rickon
said.
He
was
peeking
through
the
lens
tube
at
the
gargoyles
on
the
First
Keep.
The
direwolves
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
large
round
room,
licking
their
wounds
and
gnawing
on
bones.

“—too
young,
and—ooh,
seven
hells,
that
burns,
no,
don’t
stop,
more.
Too
young,
as
I
say,
but
you,
Bran,
you’re
old
enough
to
know
that
dreams
are
only
dreams.”

“Some
are,
some
aren’t.”
Osha
poured
pale
red
firemilk
into
a
long
gash.
Luwin
gasped.
“The
children
of
the
forest
could
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
dreaming.”

Tears
were
streaming
down
the
maester’s
face,
yet
he
shook
his
head
doggedly.
“The
children…
live
only
in
dreams.
Now.
Dead
and
gone.
Enough,
that’s
enough.
Now
the
bandages.
Pads
and
then
wrap,
and
make
it
tight,
I’ll
be
bleeding.”

“Old
Nan
says
the
children
knew
the
songs
of
the
trees,
that
they
could
fly
like
birds
and
swim
like
fish
and
talk
to
the
animals,”
Bran
said.
“She
says
that
they
made
music
so
beautiful
that
it
made
you
cry
like
a
little
baby
just
to
hear
it.”

“And
all
this
they
did
with
magic,”
Maester
Luwin
said,
distracted.
“I
wish
they
were
here
now.
A
spell
would
heal
my
arm
less
painfully,
and
they
could
talk
to
Shaggydog
and
tell
him
not
to
bite.”
He
gave
the
big
black
wolf
an
angry
glance
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye.
“Take
a
lesson,
Bran.
The
man
who
trusts
in
spells
is
dueling
with
a
glass
sword.
As
the
children
did.
Here,
let
me
show
you
something.”
He
stood
abruptly,
crossed
the
room,
and
returned
with
a
green
jar
in
his
good
hand.
“Have
a
look
at
these,”
he
said
as
he
pulled
the
stopper
and
shook
out
a
handful
of
shiny
black
arrowheads.

Bran
picked
one
up.
“It’s
made
of
glass.”
Curious,
Rickon
drifted
closer
to
peer
over
the
table.

“Dragonglass,”
Osha
named
it
as
she
sat
down
beside
Luwin,
bandagings
in
hand.

“Obsidian,”
Maester
Luwin
insisted,
holding
out
his
wounded
arm.
“Forged
in
the
fires
of
the
gods,
far
below
the
earth.
The
children
of
the
forest
hunted
with
that,
thousands
of
years
ago.
The
children
worked
no
metal.
In
place
of
mail,
they
wore
long
shirts
of
woven
leaves
and
bound
their
legs
in
bark,
so
they
seemed
to
melt
into
the
wood.
In
place
of
swords,
they
carried
blades
of
obsidian.”

“And
still
do.”
Osha
placed
soft
pads
over
the
bites
on
the
maester’s
forearm
and
bound
them
tight
with
long
strips
of
linen.

Bran
held
the
arrowhead
up
close.
The
black
glass
was
slick
and
shiny.
He
thought
it
beautiful.
“Can
I
keep
one?”

“As
you
wish,”
the
maester
said.

“I
want
one
too,”
Rickon
said.
“I
want
four.
I’m
four.”

Luwin
made
him
count
them
out.
“Careful,
they’re
still
sharp.
Don’t
cut
yourself.”

“Tell
me
about
the
children,”
Bran
said.
It
was
important.

“What
do
you
wish
to
know?”

“Everything.”

Maester
Luwin
tugged
at
his
chain
collar
where
it
chafed
against
his
neck.
“They
were
people
of
the
Dawn
Age,
the
very
first,
before
kings
and
kingdoms,”
he
said.
“In
those
days,
there
were
no
castles
or
holdfasts,
no
cities,
not
so
much
as
a
market
town
to
be
found
between
here
and
the
sea
of
Dorne.
There
were
no
men
at
all.
Only
the
children
of
the
forest
dwelt
in
the
lands
we
now
call
the
Seven
Kingdoms.

“They
were
a
people
dark
and
beautiful,
small
of
stature,
no
taller
than
children
even
when
grown
to
manhood.
They
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
wood,
in
caves
and
crannogs
and
secret
tree
towns.
Slight
as
they
were,
the
children
were
quick
and
graceful.
Male
and
female
hunted
together,
with
weirwood
bows
and
flying
snares.
Their
gods
were
the
gods
of
the
forest,
stream,
and
stone,
the
old
gods
whose
names
are
secret.
Their
wise
men
were
called
greenseers,
and
carved
strange
faces
in
the
weirwoods
to
keep
watch
on
the
woods.
How
long
the
children
reigned
here
or
where
they
came
from,
no
man
can
know.

“But
some
twelve
thousand
years
ago,
the
First
Men
appeared
from
the
east,
crossing
the
Broken
Arm
of
Dorne
before
it
was
broken.
They
came
with
bronze
swords
and
great
leathern
shields,
riding
horses.
No
horse
had
ever
been
seen
on
this
side
of
the
narrow
sea.
No
doubt
the
children
were
as
frightened
by
the
horses
as
the
First
Men
were
by
the
faces
in
the
trees.
As
the
First
Men
carved
out
holdfasts
and
farms,
they
cut
down
the
faces
and
gave
them
to
the
fire.
Horror-struck,
the
children
went
to
war.
The
old
songs
say
that
the
greenseers
used
dark
magics
to
make
the
seas
rise
and
sweep
away
the
land,
shattering
the
Arm,
but
it
was
too
late
to
close
the
door.
The
wars
went
on
until
the
earth
ran
red
with
blood
of
men
and
children
both,
but
more
children
than
men,
for
men
were
bigger
and
stronger,
and
wood
and
stone
and
obsidian
make
a
poor
match
for
bronze.
Finally
the
wise
of
both
races
prevailed,
and
the
chiefs
and
heroes
of
the
First
Men
met
the
greenseers
and
wood
dancers
amidst
the
weirwood
groves
of
a
small
island
in
the
great
lake
called
Gods
Eye.

“There
they
forged
the
Pact.
The
First
Men
were
given
the
coastlands,
the
high
plains
and
bright
meadows,
the
mountains
and
bogs,
but
the
deep
woods
were
to
remain
forever
the
children’s,
and
no
more
weirwoods
were
to
be
put
to
the
axe
anywhere
in
the
realm.
So
the
gods
might
bear
witness
to
the
signing,
every
tree
on
the
island
was
given
a
face,
and
afterward,
the
sacred
order
of
green
men
was
formed
to
keep
watch
over
the
Isle
of
Faces.

“The
Pact
began
four
thousand
years
of
friendship
between
men
and
children.
In
time,
the
First
Men
even
put
aside
the
gods
they
had
brought
with
them,
and
took
up
the
worship
of
the
secret
gods
of
the
wood.
The
signing
of
the
Pact
ended
the
Dawn
Age,
and
began
the
Age
of
Heroes.”

Bran’s
fist
curled
around
the
shiny
black
arrowhead.
“But
the
children
of
the
forest
are
all
gone
now,
you
said.”

“Here,
they
are,”
said
Osha,
as
she
bit
off
the
end
of
the
last
bandage
with
her
teeth.
“North
of
the
Wall,
things
are
different.
That’s
where
the
children
went,
and
the
giants,
and
the
other
old
races.”

Maester
Luwin
sighed.
“Woman,
by
rights
you
ought
to
be
dead
or
in
chains.
The
Starks
have
treated
you
more
gently
than
you
deserve.
It
is
unkind
to
repay
them
for
their
kindness
by
filling
the
boys’
heads
with
folly.”

“Tell
me
where
they
went,”
Bran
said.
“I
want
to
know.”

“Me
too,”
Rickon
echoed.

“Oh,
very
well,”
Luwin
muttered.
“So
long
as
the
kingdoms
of
the
First
Men
held
sway,
the
Pact
endured,
all
through
the
Age
of
Heroes
and
the
Long
Night
and
the
birth
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
yet
finally
there
came
a
time,
many
centuries
later,
when
other
peoples
crossed
the
narrow
sea.

“The
Andals
were
the
first,
a
race
of
tall,
fair-haired
warriors
who
came
with
steel
and
fire
and
the
seven-pointed
star
of
the
new
gods
painted
on
their
chests.
The
wars
lasted
hundreds
of
years,
but
in
the
end
the
six
southron
kingdoms
all
fell
before
them.
Only
here,
where
the
King
in
the
North
threw
back
every
army
that
tried
to
cross
the
Neck,
did
the
rule
of
the
First
Men
endure.
The
Andals
burnt
out
the
weirwood
groves,
hacked
down
the
faces,
slaughtered
the
children
where
they
found
them,
and
everywhere
proclaimed
the
triumph
of
the
Seven
over
the
old
gods.
So
the
children
fled
north—”

Summer
began
to
howl.

Maester
Luwin
broke
off,
startled.
When
Shaggydog
bounded
to
his
feet
and
added
his
voice
to
his
brother’s,
dread
clutched
at
Bran’s
heart.
“It’s
coming,”
he
whispered,
with
the
certainty
of
despair.
He
had
known
it
since
last
night,
he
realized,
since
the
crow
had
led
him
down
into
the
crypts
to
say
farewell.
He
had
known
it,
but
he
had
not
believed.
He
had
wanted
Maester
Luwin
to
be
right.
The
crow,
he
thought,
the
three-eyed
crow…

The
howling
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun.
Summer
padded
across
the
tower
floor
to
Shaggydog,
and
began
to
lick
at
a
mat
of
bloody
fur
on
the
back
of
his
brother’s
neck.
From
the
window
came
a
flutter
of
wings.

A
raven
landed
on
the
grey
stone
sill,
opened
its
beak,
and
gave
a
harsh,
raucous
rattle
of
distress.

Rickon
began
to
cry.
His
arrowheads
fell
from
his
hand
one
by
one
and
clattered
on
the
floor.
Bran
pulled
him
close
and
hugged
him.

Maester
Luwin
stared
at
the
black
bird
as
if
it
were
a
scorpion
with
feathers.
He
rose,
slow
as
a
sleepwalker,
and
moved
to
the
window.
When
he
whistled,
the
raven
hopped
onto
his
bandaged
forearm.
There
was
dried
blood
on
its
wings.
“A
hawk,”
Luwin
murmured,
“perhaps
an
owl.
Poor
thing,
a
wonder
it
got
through.”
He
took
the
letter
from
its
leg.

Bran
found
himself
shivering
as
the
maester
unrolled
the
paper.
“What
is
it?”
he
said,
holding
his
brother
all
the
harder.

“You
know
what
it
is,
boy,”
Osha
said,
not
unkindly.
She
put
her
hand
on
his
head.

Maester
Luwin
looked
up
at
them
numbly,
a
small
grey
man
with
blood
on
the
sleeve
of
his
grey
wool
robe
and
tears
in
his
bright
grey
eyes.
“My
lords,”
he
said
to
the
sons,
in
a
voice
gone
hoarse
and
shrunken,
“we…
we
shall
need
to
find
a
stonecarver
who
knew
his
likeness
well…”





SANSA

In
the
tower
room
at
the
heart
of
Maegor’s
Holdfast,
Sansa
gave
herself
to
the
darkness.

She
drew
the
curtains
around
her
bed,
slept,
woke
weeping,
and
slept
again.
When
she
could
not
sleep
she
lay
under
her
blankets
shivering
with
grief.
Servants
came
and
went,
bringing
meals,
but
the
sight
of
food
was
more
than
she
could
bear.
The
dishes
piled
up
on
the
table
beneath
her
window,
untouched
and
spoiling,
until
the
servants
took
them
away
again.

Sometimes
her
sleep
was
leaden
and
dreamless,
and
she
woke
from
it
more
tired
than
when
she
had
closed
her
eyes.
Yet
those
were
the
best
times,
for
when
she
dreamed,
she
dreamed
of
Father.
Waking
or
sleeping,
she
saw
him,
saw
the
gold
cloaks
fling
him
down,
saw
Ser
Ilyn
striding
forward,
unsheathing
Ice
from
the
scabbard
on
his
back,
saw
the
moment…
the
moment
when…
she
had
wanted
to
look
away,
she
had
wanted
to,
her
legs
had
gone
out
from
under
her
and
she
had
fallen
to
her
knees,
yet
somehow
she
could
not
turn
her
head,
and
all
the
people
were
screaming
and
shouting,
and
her
prince
had
smiled
at
her,
he’d
smiled
and
she’d
felt
safe,
but
only
for
a
heartbeat,
until
he
said
those
words,
and
her
father’s
legs…
that
was
what
she
remembered,
his
legs,
the
way
they’d
jerked
when
Ser
Ilyn…
when
the
sword…

Perhaps
I
will
die
too,
she
told
herself,
and
the
thought
did
not
seem
so
terrible
to
her.
If
she
flung
herself
from
the
window,
she
could
put
an
end
to
her
suffering,
and
in
the
years
to
come
the
singers
would
write
songs
of
her
grief.
Her
body
would
lie
on
the
stones
below,
broken
and
innocent,
shaming
all
those
who
had
betrayed
her.
Sansa
went
so
far
as
to
cross
the
bedchamber
and
throw
open
the
shutters…
but
then
her
courage
left
her,
and
she
ran
back
to
her
bed,
sobbing.

The
serving
girls
tried
to
talk
to
her
when
they
brought
her
meals,
but
she
never
answered
them.
Once
Grand
Maester
Pycelle
came
with
a
box
of
flasks
and
bottles,
to
ask
if
she
was
ill.
He
felt
her
brow,
made
her
undress,
and
touched
her
all
over
while
her
bedmaid
held
her
down.
When
he
left
he
gave
her
a
potion
of
honeywater
and
herbs
and
told
her
to
drink
a
swallow
every
night.
She
drank
it
all
right
then
and
went
back
to
sleep.

She
dreamt
of
footsteps
on
the
tower
stair,
an
ominous
scraping
of
leather
on
stone
as
a
man
climbed
slowly
toward
her
bedchamber,
step
by
step.
All
she
could
do
was
huddle
behind
her
door
and
listen,
trembling,
as
he
came
closer
and
closer.
It
was
Ser
Ilyn
Payne,
she
knew,
coming
for
her
with
Ice
in
his
hand,
coming
to
take
her
head.
There
was
no
place
to
run,
no
place
to
hide,
no
way
to
bar
the
door.
Finally
the
footsteps
stopped
and
she
knew
he
was
just
outside,
standing
there
silent
with
his
dead
eyes
and
his
long
pocked
face.
That
was
when
she
realized
she
was
naked.
She
crouched
down,
trying
to
cover
herself
with
her
hands,
as
her
door
began
to
swing
open,
creaking,
the
point
of
the
greatsword
poking
through…

She
woke
murmuring,
“Please,
please,
I’ll
be
good,
I’ll
be
good,
please
don’t,”
but
there
was
no
one
to
hear.

When
they
finally
came
for
her
in
truth,
Sansa
never
heard
their
footsteps.
It
was
Joffrey
who
opened
her
door,
not
Ser
Ilyn
but
the
boy
who
had
been
her
prince.
She
was
in
bed,
curled
up
tight,
her
curtains
drawn,
and
she
could
not
have
said
if
it
was
noon
or
midnight.
The
first
thing
she
heard
was
the
slam
of
the
door.
Then
her
bed
hangings
were
yanked
back,
and
she
threw
up
a
hand
against
the
sudden
light
and
saw
them
standing
over
her.

“You
will
attend
me
in
court
this
afternoon,”
Joffrey
said.
“See
that
you
bathe
and
dress
as
befits
my
betrothed.”
Sandor
Clegane
stood
at
his
shoulder
in
a
plain
brown
doublet
and
green
mantle,
his
burned
face
hideous
in
the
morning
light.
Behind
them
were
two
knights
of
the
Kingsguard
in
long
white
satin
cloaks.

Sansa
drew
her
blanket
up
to
her
chin
to
cover
herself.
“No,”
she
whimpered,
“please…
leave
me
be.”

“If
you
won’t
rise
and
dress
yourself,
my
Hound
will
do
it
for
you,”
Joffrey
said.

“I
beg
of
you,
my
prince…”

“I’m
king
now.
Dog,
get
her
out
of
bed.”

Sandor
Clegane
scooped
her
up
around
the
waist
and
lifted
her
off
the
featherbed
as
she
struggled
feebly.
Her
blanket
fell
to
the
floor.
Underneath
she
had
only
a
thin
bedgown
to
cover
her
nakedness.
“Do
as
you’re
bid,
child,”
Clegane
said.
“Dress.”
He
pushed
her
toward
her
wardrobe,
almost
gently.

Sansa
backed
away
from
them.
“I
did
as
the
queen
asked,
I
wrote
the
letters,
I
wrote
what
she
told
me.
You
promised
you’d
be
merciful.
Please,
let
me
go
home.
I
won’t
do
any
treason,
I’ll
be
good,
I
swear
it,
I
don’t
have
traitor’s
blood,
I
don’t.
I
only
want
to
go
home.”
Remembering
her
courtesies,
she
lowered
her
head.
“As
it
please
you,”
she
finished
weakly.

“It
does
not
please
me,”
Joffrey
said.
“Mother
says
I’m
still
to
marry
you,
so
you’ll
stay
here,
and
you’ll
obey.”

“I
don’t
want
to
marry
you,”
Sansa
wailed.
“You
chopped
off
my
father’s
head!”

“He
was
a
traitor.
I
never
promised
to
spare
him,
only
that
I’d
be
merciful,
and
I
was.
If
he
hadn’t
been
your
father,
I
would
have
had
him
torn
or
flayed,
but
I
gave
him
a
clean
death.”

Sansa
stared
at
him,
seeing
him
for
the
first
time.
He
was
wearing
a
padded
crimson
doublet
patterned
with
lions
and
a
cloth-of-gold
cape
with
a
high
collar
that
framed
his
face.
She
wondered
how
she
could
ever
have
thought
him
handsome.
His
lips
were
as
soft
and
red
as
the
worms
you
found
after
a
rain,
and
his
eyes
were
vain
and
cruel.
“I
hate
you,”
she
whispered.

King
Joffrey’s
face
hardened.
“My
mother
tells
me
that
it
isn’t
fitting
that
a
king
should
strike
his
wife.
Ser
Meryn.”

The
knight
was
on
her
before
she
could
think,
yanking
back
her
hand
as
she
tried
to
shield
her
face
and
backhanding
her
across
the
ear
with
a
gloved
fist.
Sansa
did
not
remember
failing,
yet
the
next
she
knew
she
was
sprawled
on
one
knee
amongst
the
rushes.
Her
head
was
ringing.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
stood
over
her,
with
blood
on
the
knuckles
of
his
white
silk
glove.

“Will
you
obey
now,
or
shall
I
have
him
chastise
you
again?”

Sansa’s
ear
felt
numb.
She
touched
it,
and
her
fingertips
came
away
wet
and
red.
“I…
as…
as
you
command,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
Joffrey
corrected
her.
“I
shall
look
for
you
in
court.”
He
turned
and
left.

Ser
Meryn
and
Ser
Arys
followed
him
out,
but
Sandor
Clegane
lingered
long
enough
to
yank
her
roughly
to
her
feet.
“Save
yourself
some
pain,
girl,
and
give
him
what
he
wants.”

“What…
what
does
he
want?
Please,
tell
me.”

“He
wants
you
to
smile
and
smell
sweet
and
be
his
lady
love,”
the
Hound
rasped.
“He
wants
to
hear
you
recite
all
your
pretty
little
words
the
way
the
septa
taught
you.
He
wants
you
to
love
him…
and
fear
him.”

After
he
was
gone,
Sansa
sank
back
onto
the
rushes,
staring
at
the
wall
until
two
of
her
bedmaids
crept
timidly
into
the
chamber.
“I
will
need
hot
water
for
my
bath,
please,”
she
told
them,
“and
perfume,
and
some
powder
to
hide
this
bruise.”
The
right
side
of
her
face
was
swollen
and
beginning
to
ache,
but
she
knew
Joffrey
would
want
her
to
be
beautiful.

The
hot
water
made
her
think
of
Winterfell,
and
she
took
strength
from
that.
She
had
not
washed
since
the
day
her
father
died,
and
she
was
startled
at
how
filthy
the
water
became.
Her
maids
sluiced
the
blood
off
her
face,
scrubbed
the
dirt
from
her
back,
washed
her
hair
and
brushed
it
out
until
it
sprang
back
in
thick
auburn
curls.
Sansa
did
not
speak
to
them,
except
to
give
them
commands;
they
were
Lannister
servants,
not
her
own,
and
she
did
not
trust
them.
When
the
time
came
to
dress,
she
chose
the
green
silk
gown
that
she
had
worn
to
the
tourney.
She
recalled
how
gallant
Joff
had
been
to
her
that
night
at
the
feast.
Perhaps
it
would
make
him
remember
as
well,
and
treat
her
more
gently.

She
drank
a
glass
of
buttermilk
and
nibbled
at
some
sweet
biscuits
as
she
waited,
to
settle
her
stomach.
It
was
midday
when
Ser
Meryn
returned.
He
had
donned
his
white
armor;
a
shirt
of
enameled
scales
chased
with
gold,
a
tall
helm
with
a
golden
sunburst
crest,
greaves
and
gorget
and
gauntlet
and
boots
of
gleaming
plate,
a
heavy
wool
cloak
clasped
with
a
golden
lion.
His
visor
had
been
removed
from
his
helm,
to
better
show
his
dour
face;
pouchy
bags
under
his
eyes,
a
wide
sour
mouth,
rusty
hair
spotted
with
grey.
“My
lady,”
he
said,
bowing,
as
if
he
had
not
beaten
her
bloody
only
three
hours
past.
“His
Grace
has
instructed
me
to
escort
you
to
the
throne
room.”

“Did
he
instruct
you
to
hit
me
if
I
refused
to
come?”

“Are
you
refusing
to
come,
my
lady?”
The
look
he
gave
her
was
without
expression.
He
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
the
bruise
he
had
left
her.

He
did
not
hate
her,
Sansa
realized;
neither
did
he
love
her.
He
felt
nothing
for
her
at
all.
She
was
only
a…
a
thing
to
him.
“No,”
she
said,
rising.
She
wanted
to
rage,
to
hurt
him
as
he’d
hurt
her,
to
warn
him
that
when
she
was
queen
she
would
have
him
exiled
if
he
ever
dared
strike
her
again…
but
she
remembered
what
the
Hound
had
told
her,
so
all
she
said
was,
“I
shall
do
whatever
His
Grace
commands.”

“As
I
do,”
he
replied.

“Yes…
but
you
are
no
true
knight,
Ser
Meryn.”

Sandor
Clegane
would
have
laughed
at
that,
Sansa
knew.
Other
men
might
have
cursed
her,
warned
her
to
keep
silent,
even
begged
for
her
forgiveness.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
did
none
of
these.
Ser
Meryn
Trant
simply
did
not
care.

The
balcony
was
deserted
save
for
Sansa.
She
stood
with
her
head
bowed,
fighting
to
hold
back
her
tears,
while
below
Joffrey
sat
on
his
Iron
Throne
and
dispensed
what
it
pleased
him
to
call
justice.
Nine
cases
out
of
ten
seemed
to
bore
him;
those
he
allowed
his
council
to
handle,
squirming
restlessly
while
Lord
Baelish,
Grand
Maester
Pycelle,
or
Queen
Cersei
resolved
the
matter.
When
he
did
choose
to
make
a
ruling,
though,
not
even
his
queen
mother
could
sway
him.

A
thief
was
brought
before
him
and
he
had
Ser
Ilyn
chop
his
hand
off,
right
there
in
court.
Two
knights
came
to
him
with
a
dispute
about
some
land,
and
he
decreed
that
they
should
duel
for
it
on
the
morrow.
“To
the
death,”
he
added.
A
woman
fell
to
her
knees
to
plead
for
the
head
of
a
man
executed
as
a
traitor.
She
had
loved
him,
she
said,
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
decently
buried.
“If
you
loved
a
traitor,
you
must
be
a
traitor
too,”
Joffrey
said.
Two
gold
cloaks
dragged
her
off
to
the
dungeons.

Frog-faced
Lord
Slynt
sat
at
the
end
of
the
council
table
wearing
a
black
velvet
doublet
and
a
shiny
cloth-of-gold
cape,
nodding
with
approval
every
time
the
king
pronounced
a
sentence.
Sansa
stared
hard
at
his
ugly
face,
remembering
how
he
had
thrown
down
her
father
for
Ser
Ilyn
to
behead,
wishing
she
could
hurt
him,
wishing
that
some
hero
would
throw
him
down
and
cut
off
his
head.
But
a
voice
inside
her
whispered,
There
are
no
heroes,
and
she
remembered
what
Lord
Petyr
had
said
to
her,
here
in
this
very
hall.
“Life
is
not
a
song,
sweetling,”
he’d
told
her.
“You
may
learn
that
one
day
to
your
sorrow.”
In
life,
the
monsters
win,
she
told
herself,
and
now
it
was
the
Hound’s
voice
she
heard,
a
cold
rasp,
metal
on
stone.
“Save
yourself
some
pain,
girl,
and
give
him
what
he
wants.”

The
last
case
was
a
plump
tavern
singer,
accused
of
making
a
song
that
ridiculed
the
late
King
Robert.
Joff
commanded
them
to
fetch
his
woodharp
and
ordered
him
to
perform
the
song
for
the
court.
The
singer
wept
and
swore
he
would
never
sing
that
song
again,
but
the
king
insisted.
It
was
sort
of
a
funny
song,
all
about
Robert
fighting
with
a
pig.
The
pig
was
the
boar
who’d
killed
him,
Sansa
knew,
but
in
some
verses
it
almost
sounded
as
if
he
were
singing
about
the
queen.
When
the
song
was
done,
Joffrey
announced
that
he’d
decided
to
be
merciful.
The
singer
could
keep
either
his
fingers
or
his
tongue.
He
would
have
a
day
to
make
his
choice.
Janos
Slynt
nodded.

That
was
the
final
business
of
the
afternoon,
Sansa
saw
with
relief,
but
her
ordeal
was
not
yet
done.
When
the
herald’s
voice
dismissed
the
court,
she
fled
the
balcony,
only
to
find
Joffrey
waiting
for
her
at
the
base
of
the
curving
stairs.
The
Hound
was
with
him,
and
Ser
Meryn
as
well.
The
young
king
examined
her
critically,
top
to
bottom.
“You
look
much
better
than
you
did.”

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace,”
Sansa
said.
Hollow
words,
but
they
made
him
nod
and
smile.

“Walk
with
me,”
Joffrey
commanded,
offering
her
his
arm.
She
had
no
choice
but
to
take
it.
The
touch
of
his
hand
would
have
thrilled
her
once;
now
it
made
her
flesh
crawl.
“My
name
day
will
be
here
soon,”
Joffrey
said
as
they
slipped
out
the
rear
of
the
throne
room.
“There
will
be
a
great
feast,
and
gifts.
What
are
you
going
to
give
me?”

“I…
I
had
not
thought,
my
lord.”

“Your
Grace,”
he
said
sharply.
“You
truly
are
a
stupid
girl,
aren’t
you?
My
mother
says
so.”

“She
does?”
After
all
that
had
happened,
his
words
should
have
lost
their
power
to
hurt
her,
yet
somehow
they
had
not.
The
queen
had
always
been
so
kind
to
her.

“Oh,
yes.
She
worries
about
our
children,
whether
they’ll
be
stupid
like
you,
but
I
told
her
not
to
trouble
herself.”
The
king
gestured,
and
Ser
Meryn
opened
a
door
for
them.

“Thank
you,
Your
Grace,”
she
murmured.
The
Hound
was
right,
she
thought,
I
am
only
a
little
bird,
repeating
the
words
they
taught
me.
The
sun
had
fallen
below
the
western
wall,
and
the
stones
of
the
Red
Keep
glowed
dark
as
blood.

“I’ll
get
you
with
child
as
soon
as
you’re
able,”
Joffrey
said
as
he
escorted
her
across
the
practice
yard.
“If
the
first
one
is
stupid,
I’ll
chop
off
your
head
and
find
a
smarter
wife.
When
do
you
think
you’ll
be
able
to
have
children?”

Sansa
could
not
look
at
him,
he
shamed
her
so.
“Septa
Mordane
says
most…
most
highborn
girls
have
their
flowering
at
twelve
or
thirteen.”

Joffrey
nodded.
“This
way.”
He
led
her
into
the
gatehouse,
to
the
base
of
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
battlements.

Sansa
jerked
back
away
from
him,
trembling.
Suddenly
she
knew
where
they
were
going.
“No,”
she
said,
her
voice
a
frightened
gasp.
“Please,
no,
don’t
make
me,
I
beg
you…”

Joffrey
pressed
his
lips
together.
“I
want
to
show
you
what
happens
to
traitors.”

Sansa
shook
her
head
wildly.
“I
won’t.
I
won’t.”

“I
can
have
Ser
Meryn
drag
you
up,”
he
said.
“You
won’t
like
that.
You
had
better
do
what
I
say.”
Joffrey
reached
for
her,
and
Sansa
cringed
away
from
him,
backing
into
the
Hound.

“Do
it,
girl,”
Sandor
Clegane
told
her,
pushing
her
back
toward
the
king.
His
mouth
twitched
on
the
burned
side
of
his
face
and
Sansa
could
almost
hear
the
rest
of
it.
He’ll
have
you
up
there
no
matter
what,
so
give
him
what
he
wants.

She
forced
herself
to
take
King
Joffrey’s
hand.
The
climb
was
something
out
of
a
nightmare;
every
step
was
a
struggle,
as
if
she
were
pulling
her
feet
out
of
ankle-deep
mud,
and
there
were
more
steps
than
she
would
have
believed,
a
thousand
thousand
steps,
and
horror
waiting
on
the
ramparts.

From
the
high
battlements
of
the
gatehouse,
the
whole
world
spread
out
below
them.
Sansa
could
see
the
Great
Sept
of
Baelor
on
Visenya’s
hill,
where
her
father
had
died.
At
the
other
end
of
the
Street
of
the
Sisters
stood
the
fire-blackened
ruins
of
the
Dragonpit.
To
the
west,
the
swollen
red
sun
was
half-hidden
behind
the
Gate
of
the
Gods.
The
salt
sea
was
at
her
back,
and
to
the
south
was
the
fish
market
and
the
docks
and
the
swirling
torrent
of
the
Blackwater
Rush.
And
to
the
north…

She
turned
that
way,
and
saw
only
the
city,
streets
and
alleys
and
hills
and
bottoms
and
more
streets
and
more
alleys
and
the
stone
of
distant
walls.
Yet
she
knew
that
beyond
them
was
open
country,
farms
and
fields
and
forests,
and
beyond
that,
north
and
north
and
north
again,
stood
Winterfell.

“What
are
you
looking
at?”
Joffrey
said.
“This
is
what
I
wanted
you
to
see,
right
here.”

A
thick
stone
parapet
protected
the
outer
edge
of
the
rampart,
reaching
as
high
as
Sansa’s
chin,
with
crenellations
cut
into
it
every
five
feet
for
archers.
The
heads
were
mounted
between
the
crenels,
along
the
top
of
the
wall,
impaled
on
iron
spikes
so
they
faced
out
over
the
city.
Sansa
had
noted
them
the
moment
she’d
stepped
out
onto
the
wallwalk,
but
the
river
and
the
bustling
streets
and
the
setting
sun
were
ever
so
much
prettier.
He
can
make
me
look
at
the
heads,
she
told
herself,
but
he
can’t
make
me
see
them.

“This
one
is
your
father,”
he
said.
“This
one
here.
Dog,
turn
it
around
so
she
can
see
him.”

Sandor
Clegane
took
the
head
by
the
hair
and
turned
it.
The
severed
head
had
been
dipped
in
tar
to
preserve
it
longer.
Sansa
looked
at
it
calmly,
not
seeing
it
at
all.
It
did
not
really
look
like
Lord
Eddard,
she
thought;
it
did
not
even
look
real.
“How
long
do
I
have
to
look?”

Joffrey
seemed
disappointed.
“Do
you
want
to
see
the
rest?”
There
was
a
long
row
of
them.

“If
it
please
Your
Grace.”

Joffrey
marched
her
down
the
wallwalk,
past
a
dozen
more
heads
and
two
empty
spikes.
“I’m
saving
those
for
my
uncle
Stannis
and
my
uncle
Renly,”
he
explained.
The
other
heads
had
been
dead
and
mounted
much
longer
than
her
father.
Despite
the
tar,
most
were
long
past
being
recognizable.
The
king
pointed
to
one
and
said,
“That’s
your
septa
there,”
but
Sansa
could
not
even
have
told
that
it
was
a
woman.
The
jaw
had
rotted
off
her
face,
and
birds
had
eaten
one
ear
and
most
of
a
cheek.

Sansa
had
wondered
what
had
happened
to
Septa
Mordane,
although
she
supposed
she
had
known
all
along.
“Why
did
you
kill
her?”
she
asked.
“She
was
godsworn…”

“She
was
a
traitor.”
Joffrey
looked
pouty;
somehow
she
was
upsetting
him.
“You
haven’t
said
what
you
mean
to
give
me
for
my
name
day.
Maybe
I
should
give
you
something
instead,
would
you
like
that?”

“If
it
please
you,
my
lord,”
Sansa
said.

When
he
smiled,
she
knew
he
was
mocking
her.
“Your
brother
is
a
traitor
too,
you
know.”
He
turned
Septa
Mordane’s
head
back
around.
“I
remember
your
brother
from
Winterfell.
My
dog
called
him
the
lord
of
the
wooden
sword.
Didn’t
you,
dog?”

“Did
I?”
the
Hound
replied.
“I
don’t
recall.”

Joffrey
gave
a
petulant
shrug.
“Your
brother
defeated
my
uncle
Jaime.
My
mother
says
it
was
treachery
and
deceit.
She
wept
when
she
heard.
Women
are
all
weak,
even
her,
though
she
pretends
she
isn’t.
She
says
we
need
to
stay
in
King’s
Landing
in
case
my
other
uncles
attack,
but
I
don’t
care.
After
my
name
day
feast,
I’m
going
to
raise
a
host
and
kill
your
brother
myself.
That’s
what
I’ll
give
you,
Lady
Sansa.
Your
brother’s
head.”

A
kind
of
madness
took
over
her
then,
and
she
heard
herself
say,
“Maybe
my
brother
will
give
me
your
head.”

Joffrey
scowled.
“You
must
never
mock
me
like
that.
A
true
wife
does
not
mock
her
lord.
Ser
Meryn,
teach
her.”

This
time
the
knight
grasped
her
beneath
the
jaw
and
held
her
head
still
as
he
struck
her.
He
hit
her
twice,
left
to
right,
and
harder,
right
to
left.
Her
lip
split
and
blood
ran
down
her
chin,
to
mingle
with
the
salt
of
her
tears.

“You
shouldn’t
be
crying
all
the
time,”
Joffrey
told
her.
“You’re
more
pretty
when
you
smile
and
laugh.”

Sansa
made
herself
smile,
afraid
that
he
would
have
Ser
Meryn
hit
her
again
if
she
did
not,
but
it
was
no
good,
the
king
still
shook
his
head.
“Wipe
off
the
blood,
you’re
all
messy.”

The
outer
parapet
came
up
to
her
chin,
but
along
the
inner
edge
of
the
walk
was
nothing,
nothing
but
a
long
plunge
to
the
bailey
seventy
or
eighty
feet
below.
All
it
would
take
was
a
shove,
she
told
herself.
He
was
standing
right
there,
right
there,
smirking
at
her
with
those
fat
wormlips.
You
could
do
it,
she
told
herself.
You
could.
Do
it
right
now.
It
wouldn’t
even
matter
if
she
went
over
with
him.
It
wouldn’t
matter
at
all.

“Here,
girl.”
Sandor
Clegane
knelt
before
her,
between
her
and
Joffrey.
With
a
delicacy
surprising
in
such
a
big
man,
he
dabbed
at
the
blood
welling
from
her
broken
lip.

The
moment
was
gone.
Sansa
lowered
her
eyes.
“Thank
you,”
she
said
when
he
was
done.
She
was
a
good
girl,
and
always
remembered
her
courtesies.





DAENERYS

Wings
shadowed
her
fever
dreams.

“You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

She
was
walking
down
a
long
hall
beneath
high
stone
arches.
She
could
not
look
behind
her,
must
not
look
behind
her.
There
was
a
door
ahead
of
her,
tiny
with
distance,
but
even
from
afar,
she
saw
that
it
was
painted
red.
She
walked
faster,
and
her
bare
feet
left
bloody
footprints
on
the
stone.

“You
don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

She
saw
sunlight
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
the
living
plain,
rich
with
the
smells
of
earth
and
death.
Wind
stirred
the
grasses,
and
they
rippled
like
water.
Drogo
held
her
in
strong
arms,
and
his
hand
stroked
her
sex
and
opened
her
and
woke
that
sweet
wetness
that
was
his
alone,
and
the
stars
smiled
down
on
them,
stars
in
a
daylight
sky.
“Home,”
she
whispered
as
he
entered
her
and
filled
her
with
his
seed,
but
suddenly
the
stars
were
gone,
and
across
the
blue
sky
swept
the
great
wings,
and
the
world
took
flame.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

Ser
Jorah’s
face
was
drawn
and
sorrowful.
“Rhaegar
was
the
last
dragon,”
he
told
her.
He
warmed
translucent
hands
over
a
glowing
brazier
where
stone
eggs
smouldered
red
as
coals.
One
moment
he
was
there
and
the
next
he
was
fading,
his
flesh
colorless,
less
substantial
than
the
wind.
“The
last
dragon,”
he
whispered,
thin
as
a
wisp,
and
was
gone.
She
felt
the
dark
behind
her,
and
the
red
door
seemed
farther
away
than
ever.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon,
do
you?”

Viserys
stood
before
her,
screaming.
“The
dragon
does
not
beg,
slut.
You
do
not
command
the
dragon.
I
am
the
dragon,
and
I
will
be
crowned.”
The
molten
gold
trickled
down
his
face
like
wax,
burning
deep
channels
in
his
flesh.
“I
am
the
dragon
and
I
will
be
crowned!”
he
shrieked,
and
his
fingers
snapped
like
snakes,
biting
at
her
nipples,
pinching,
twisting,
even
as
his
eyes
burst
and
ran
like
jelly
down
seared
and
blackened
cheeks.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

The
red
door
was
so
far
ahead
of
her,
and
she
could
feel
the
icy
breath
behind,
sweeping
up
on
her.
If
it
caught
her
she
would
die
a
death
that
was
more
than
death,
howling
forever
alone
in
the
darkness.
She
began
to
run.

“…don’t
want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

She
could
feel
the
heat
inside
her,
a
terrible
burning
in
her
womb.
Her
son
was
tall
and
proud,
with
Drogo’s
copper
skin
and
her
own
silver-gold
hair,
violet
eyes
shaped
like
almonds.
And
he
smiled
for
her
and
began
to
lift
his
hand
toward
hers,
but
when
he
opened
his
mouth
the
fire
poured
out.
She
saw
his
heart
burning
through
his
chest,
and
in
an
instant
he
was
gone,
consumed
like
a
moth
by
a
candle,
turned
to
ash.
She
wept
for
her
child,
the
promise
of
a
sweet
mouth
on
her
breast,
but
her
tears
turned
to
steam
as
they
touched
her
skin.

“…want
to
wake
the
dragon…”

Ghosts
lined
the
hallway,
dressed
in
the
faded
raiment
of
kings.
In
their
hands
were
swords
of
pale
fire.
They
had
hair
of
silver
and
hair
of
gold
and
hair
of
platinum
white,
and
their
eyes
were
opal
and
amethyst,
tourmaline
and
jade.
“Faster,”
they
cried,
“faster,
faster.”
She
raced,
her
feet
melting
the
stone
wherever
they
touched.
“Faster!”
the
ghosts
cried
as
one,
and
she
screamed
and
threw
herself
forward.
A
great
knife
of
pain
ripped
down
her
back,
and
she
felt
her
skin
tear
open
and
smelled
the
stench
of
burning
blood
and
saw
the
shadow
of
wings.
And
Daenerys
Targaryen
flew.

“…wake
the
dragon…”

The
door
loomed
before
her,
the
red
door,
so
close,
so
close,
the
hall
was
a
blur
around
her,
the
cold
receding
behind.
And
now
the
stone
was
gone
and
she
flew
across
the
Dothraki
sea,
high
and
higher,
the
green
rippling
beneath,
and
all
that
lived
and
breathed
fled
in
terror
from
the
shadow
of
her
wings.
She
could
smell
home,
she
could
see
it,
there,
just
beyond
that
door,
green
fields
and
great
stone
houses
and
arms
to
keep
her
warm,
there.
She
threw
open
the
door.

“…the
dragon…”

And
saw
her
brother
Rhaegar,
mounted
on
a
stallion
as
black
as
his
armor.
Fire
glimmered
red
through
the
narrow
eye
slit
of
his
helm.
“The
last
dragon,”
Ser
Jorah’s
voice
whispered
faintly.
“The
last,
the
last.”
Dany
lifted
his
polished
black
visor.
The
face
within
was
her
own.

After
that,
for
a
long
time,
there
was
only
the
pain,
the
fire
within
her,
and
the
whisperings
of
stars.

She
woke
to
the
taste
of
ashes.

“No,”
she
moaned,
“no,
please.”

“Khaleesi?”
Jhiqui
hovered
over
her,
a
frightened
doe.

The
tent
was
drenched
in
shadow,
still
and
close.
Flakes
of
ash
drifted
upward
from
a
brazier,
and
Dany
followed
them
with
her
eyes
through
the
smoke
hole
above.
Flying,
she
thought.
I
had
wings,
I
was
flying.
But
it
was
only
a
dream.
“Help
me,”
she
whispered,
struggling
to
rise.
“Bring
me…”
Her
voice
was
raw
as
a
wound,
and
she
could
not
think
what
she
wanted.
Why
did
she
hurt
so
much?
It
was
as
if
her
body
had
been
torn
to
pieces
and
remade
from
the
scraps.
“I
want…”

“Yes,
Khaleesi.”
Quick
as
that
Jhiqui
was
gone,
bolting
from
the
tent,
shouting.
Dany
needed…
something…
someone…
what?
It
was
important,
she
knew.
It
was
the
only
thing
in
the
world
that
mattered.
She
rolled
onto
her
side
and
got
an
elbow
under
her,
fighting
the
blanket
tangled
about
her
legs.
It
was
so
hard
to
move.
The
world
swam
dizzily.
I
have
to…

They
found
her
on
the
carpet,
crawling
toward
her
dragon
eggs.
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
back
to
her
sleeping
silks,
while
she
struggled
feebly
against
him.
Over
his
shoulder
she
saw
her
three
handmaids,
Jhogo
with
his
little
wisp
of
mustache,
and
the
flat
broad
face
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“I
must,”
she
tried
to
tell
them,
“I
have
to…”

“…sleep,
Princess,”
Ser
Jorah
said.

“No,”
Dany
said.
“Please.
Please.”

“Yes.”
He
covered
her
with
silk,
though
she
was
burning.
“Sleep
and
grow
strong
again,
Khaleesi.
Come
back
to
us.”
And
then
Mirri
Maz
Duur
was
there,
the
maegi,
tipping
a
cup
against
her
lips.
She
tasted
sour
milk,
and
something
else,
something
thick
and
bitter.
Warm
liquid
ran
down
her
chin.
Somehow
she
swallowed.
The
tent
grew
dimmer,
and
sleep
took
her
again.
This
time
she
did
not
dream.
She
floated,
serene
and
at
peace,
on
a
black
sea
that
knew
no
shore.

After
a
time—a
night,
a
day,
a
year,
she
could
not
say—she
woke
again.
The
tent
was
dark,
its
silken
walls
flapping
like
wings
when
the
wind
gusted
outside.
This
time
Dany
did
not
attempt
to
rise.
“Irri,”
she
called,
“Jhiqui.
Doreah.”
They
were
there
at
once.
“My
throat
is
dry,”
she
said,
“so
dry,”
and
they
brought
her
water.
It
was
warm
and
flat,
yet
Dany
drank
it
eagerly,
and
sent
Jhiqui
for
more.
Irri
dampened
a
soft
cloth
and
stroked
her
brow.
“I
have
been
sick,”
Dany
said.
The
Dothraki
girl
nodded.
“How
long?”
The
cloth
was
soothing,
but
Irri
seemed
so
sad,
it
frightened
her.
“Long,”
she
whispered.
When
Jhiqui
returned
with
more
water,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
came
with
her,
eyes
heavy
from
sleep.
“Drink,”
she
said,
lifting
Dany’s
head
to
the
cup
once
more,
but
this
time
it
was
only
wine.
Sweet,
sweet
wine.
Dany
drank,
and
lay
back,
listening
to
the
soft
sound
of
her
own
breathing.
She
could
feel
the
heaviness
in
her
limbs,
as
sleep
crept
in
to
fill
her
up
once
more.
“Bring
me…”
she
murmured,
her
voice
slurred
and
drowsy.
“Bring…
I
want
to
hold…”

“Yes?”
the
maegi
asked.
“What
is
it
you
wish,
Khaleesi?”

“Bring
me…
egg…
dragon’s
egg…
please…”
Her
lashes
turned
to
lead,
and
she
was
too
weary
to
hold
them
up.

When
she
woke
the
third
time,
a
shaft
of
golden
sunlight
was
pouring
through
the
smoke
hole
of
the
tent,
and
her
arms
were
wrapped
around
a
dragon’s
egg.
It
was
the
pale
one,
its
scales
the
color
of
butter
cream,
veined
with
whorls
of
gold
and
bronze,
and
Dany
could
feel
the
heat
of
it.
Beneath
her
bedsilks,
a
fine
sheen
of
perspiration
covered
her
bare
skin.
Dragondew,
she
thought.
Her
fingers
trailed
lightly
across
the
surface
of
the
shell,
tracing
the
wisps
of
gold,
and
deep
in
the
stone
she
felt
something
twist
and
stretch
in
response.
It
did
not
frighten
her.
All
her
fear
was
gone,
burned
away.

Dany
touched
her
brow.
Under
the
film
of
sweat,
her
skin
was
cool
to
the
touch,
her
fever
gone.
She
made
herself
sit.
There
was
a
moment
of
dizziness,
and
the
deep
ache
between
her
thighs.
Yet
she
felt
strong.
Her
maids
came
running
at
the
sound
of
her
voice.
“Water,”
she
told
them,
“a
flagon
of
water,
cold
as
you
can
find
it.
And
fruit,
I
think.
Dates.”

“As
you
say,
Khaleesi.”

“I
want
Ser
Jorah,”
she
said,
standing.
Jhiqui
brought
a
sandsilk
robe
and
draped
it
over
her
shoulders.
“And
a
warm
bath,
and
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
and…”
Memory
came
back
to
her
all
at
once,
and
she
faltered.
“Khal
Drogo,”
she
forced
herself
to
say,
watching
their
faces
with
dread.
“Is
he—?”

“The
khal
lives,”
Irri
answered
quietly…
yet
Dany
saw
a
darkness
in
her
eyes
when
she
said
the
words,
and
no
sooner
had
she
spoken
than
she
rushed
away
to
fetch
water.

She
turned
to
Doreah.
“Tell
me.”

“I…
I
shall
bring
Ser
Jorah,”
the
Lysene
girl
said,
bowing
her
head
and
fleeing
the
tent.

Jhiqui
would
have
run
as
well,
but
Dany
caught
her
by
the
wrist
and
held
her
captive.
“What
is
it?
I
must
know.
Drogo…
and
my
child.”
Why
had
she
not
remembered
the
child
until
now?
“My
son…
Rhaego…
where
is
he?
I
want
him.”

Her
handmaid
lowered
her
eyes.
“The
boy…
he
did
not
live,
Khaleesi.”
Her
voice
was
a
frightened
whisper.

Dany
released
her
wrist.
My
son
is
dead,
she
thought
as
Jhiqui
left
the
tent.
She
had
known
somehow.
She
had
known
since
she
woke
the
first
time
to
Jhiqui’s
tears.
No,
she
had
known
before
she
woke.
Her
dream
came
back
to
her,
sudden
and
vivid,
and
she
remembered
the
tall
man
with
the
copper
skin
and
long
silver-gold
braid,
bursting
into
flame.

She
should
weep,
she
knew,
yet
her
eyes
were
dry
as
ash.
She
had
wept
in
her
dream,
and
the
tears
had
turned
to
steam
on
her
cheeks.
All
the
grief
has
been
burned
out
of
me,
she
told
herself.
She
felt
sad,
and
yet…
she
could
feel
Rhaego
receding
from
her,
as
if
he
had
never
been.

Ser
Jorah
and
Mirri
Maz
Duur
entered
a
few
moments
later,
and
found
Dany
standing
over
the
other
dragon’s
eggs,
the
two
still
in
their
chest.
It
seemed
to
her
that
they
felt
as
hot
as
the
one
she
had
slept
with,
which
was
passing
strange.
“Ser
Jorah,
come
here,”
she
said.
She
took
his
hand
and
placed
it
on
the
black
egg
with
the
scarlet
swirls.
“What
do
you
feel?”

“Shell,
hard
as
rock.”
The
knight
was
wary.
“Scales.”

“Heat?”

“No.
Cold
stone.”
He
took
his
hand
away.
“Princess,
are
you
well?
Should
you
be
up,
weak
as
you
are?”

“Weak?
I
am
strong,
Jorah.”
To
please
him,
she
reclined
on
a
pile
of
cushions.
“Tell
me
how
my
child
died.”

“He
never
lived,
my
princess.
The
women
say…”
He
faltered,
and
Dany
saw
how
the
flesh
hung
loose
on
him,
and
the
way
he
limped
when
he
moved.

“Tell
me.
Tell
me
what
the
women
say.”

He
turned
his
face
away.
His
eyes
were
haunted.
“They
say
the
child
was…”

She
waited,
but
Ser
Jorah
could
not
say
it.
His
face
grew
dark
with
shame.
He
looked
half
a
corpse
himself.

“Monstrous,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
finished
for
him.
The
knight
was
a
powerful
man,
yet
Dany
understood
in
that
moment
that
the
maegi
was
stronger,
and
crueler,
and
infinitely
more
dangerous.
“Twisted.
I
drew
him
forth
myself.
He
was
scaled
like
a
lizard,
blind,
with
the
stub
of
a
tail
and
small
leather
wings
like
the
wings
of
a
bat.
When
I
touched
him,
the
flesh
sloughed
off
the
bone,
and
inside
he
was
full
of
graveworms
and
the
stink
of
corruption.
He
had
been
dead
for
years.”

Darkness,
Dany
thought.
The
terrible
darkness
sweeping
up
behind
to
devour
her.
If
she
looked
back
she
was
lost.
“My
son
was
alive
and
strong
when
Ser
Jorah
carried
me
into
this
tent,”
she
said.
“I
could
feel
him
kicking,
fighting
to
be
born.”

“That
may
be
as
it
may
be,”
answered
Mirri
Maz
Duur,
“yet
the
creature
that
came
forth
from
your
womb
was
as
I
said.
Death
was
in
that
tent,
Khaleesi.”

“Only
shadows,”
Ser
Jorah
husked,
but
Dany
could
hear
the
doubt
in
his
voice.
“I
saw,
maegi.
I
saw
you,
alone,
dancing
with
the
shadows.
“

“The
grave
casts
long
shadows,
Iron
Lord,”
Mirri
said.
“Long
and
dark,
and
in
the
end
no
light
can
hold
them
back.”

Ser
Jorah
had
killed
her
son,
Dany
knew.
He
had
done
what
he
did
for
love
and
loyalty,
yet
he
had
carried
her
into
a
place
no
living
man
should
go
and
fed
her
baby
to
the
darkness.
He
knew
it
too;
the
grey
face,
the
hollow
eyes,
the
limp.
“The
shadows
have
touched
you
too,
Ser
Jorah,”
she
told
him.
The
knight
made
no
reply.
Dany
turned
to
the
godswife.
“You
warned
me
that
only
death
could
pay
for
life.
I
thought
you
meant
the
horse.”

“No,”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
said.
“That
was
a
lie
you
told
yourself.
You
knew
the
price.”

Had
she?
Had
she?
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“The
price
was
paid,”
Dany
said.
“The
horse,
my
child,
Quaro
and
Qotho,
Haggo
and
Cohollo.
The
price
was
paid
and
paid
and
paid.”
She
rose
from
her
cushions.
“Where
is
Khal
Drogo?
Show
him
to
me,
godswife,
maegi,
bloodmage,
whatever
you
are.
Show
me
Khal
Drogo.
Show
me
what
I
bought
with
my
son’s
life.”

“As
you
command,
Khaleesi,”
the
old
woman
said.
“Come,
I
will
take
you
to
him.”

Dany
was
weaker
than
she
knew.
Ser
Jorah
slipped
an
arm
around
her
and
helped
her
stand.
“Time
enough
for
this
later,
my
princess,”
he
said
quietly.

“I
would
see
him
now,
Ser
Jorah.”

After
the
dimness
of
the
tent,
the
world
outside
was
blinding
bright.
The
sun
burned
like
molten
gold,
and
the
land
was
seared
and
empty.
Her
handmaids
waited
with
fruit
and
wine
and
water,
and
Jhogo
moved
close
to
help
Ser
Jorah
support
her.
Aggo
and
Rakharo
stood
behind.
The
glare
of
sun
on
sand
made
it
hard
to
see
more,
until
Dany
raised
her
hand
to
shade
her
eyes.
She
saw
the
ashes
of
a
fire,
a
few
score
horses
milling
listlessly
and
searching
for
a
bite
of
grass,
a
scattering
of
tents
and
bedrolls.
A
small
crowd
of
children
had
gathered
to
watch
her,
and
beyond
she
glimpsed
women
going
about
their
work,
and
withered
old
men
staring
at
the
flat
blue
sky
with
tired
eyes,
swatting
feebly
at
bloodflies.
A
count
might
show
a
hundred
people,
no
more.
Where
the
other
forty
thousand
had
made
their
camp,
only
the
wind
and
dust
lived
now.

“Drogo’s
khalasar
is
gone,”
she
said.

“A
khal
who
cannot
ride
is
no
khal,”
said
Jhogo.

“The
Dothraki
follow
only
the
strong,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“I
am
sorry,
my
princess.
There
was
no
way
to
hold
them.
Ko
Pono
left
first,
naming
himself
Khal
Pono,
and
many
followed
him.
Jhaqo
was
not
long
to
do
the
same.
The
rest
slipped
away
night
by
night,
in
large
bands
and
small.
There
are
a
dozen
new
khalasars
on
the
Dothraki
sea,
where
once
there
was
only
Drogo’s.”

“The
old
remain,”
said
Aggo.
“The
frightened,
the
weak,
and
the
sick.
And
we
who
swore.
We
remain.”

“They
took
Khal
Drogo’s
herds,
Khaleesi,”
Rakharo
said.
“We
were
too
few
to
stop
them.
It
is
the
right
of
the
strong
to
take
from
the
weak.
They
took
many
slaves
as
well,
the
khal’s
and
yours,
yet
they
left
some
few.”

“Eroeh?”
asked
Dany,
remembering
the
frightened
child
she
had
saved
outside
the
city
of
the
Lamb
Men.

“Mago
seized
her,
who
is
Khal
Jhaqo’s
bloodrider
now,”
said
Jhogo.
“He
mounted
her
high
and
low
and
gave
her
to
his
khal,
and
Jhaqo
gave
her
to
his
other
bloodriders.
They
were
six.
When
they
were
done
with
her,
they
cut
her
throat.”

“It
was
her
fate,
Khaleesi,”
said
Aggo.

If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“It
was
a
cruel
fate,”
Dany
said,
“yet
not
so
cruel
as
Mago’s
will
be.
I
promise
you
that,
by
the
old
gods
and
the
new,
by
the
lamb
god
and
the
horse
god
and
every
god
that
lives.
I
swear
it
by
the
Mother
of
Mountains
and
the
Womb
of
the
World.
Before
I
am
done
with
them,
Mago
and
Ko
Jhaqo
will
plead
for
the
mercy
they
showed
Eroeh.”

The
Dothraki
exchanged
uncertain
glances.
“Khaleesi,”
the
handmaid
Irri
explained,
as
if
to
a
child,
“Jhaqo
is
a
khal
now,
with
twenty
thousand
riders
at
his
back.”

She
lifted
her
head.
“And
I
am
Daenerys
Stormhorn,
Daenerys
of
House
Targaryen,
of
the
blood
of
Aegon
the
Conqueror
and
Maegor
the
Cruel
and
old
Valyria
before
them.
I
am
the
dragon’s
daughter,
and
I
swear
to
you,
these
men
will
die
screaming.
Now
bring
me
to
Khal
Drogo.”

He
was
lying
on
the
bare
red
earth,
staring
up
at
the
sun.

A
dozen
bloodflies
had
settled
on
his
body,
though
he
did
not
seem
to
feel
them.
Dany
brushed
them
away
and
knelt
beside
him.
His
eyes
were
wide
open
but
did
not
see,
and
she
knew
at
once
that
he
was
blind.
When
she
whispered
his
name,
he
did
not
seem
to
hear.
The
wound
on
his
breast
was
as
healed
as
it
would
ever
be,
the
scar
that
covered
it
grey
and
red
and
hideous.

“Why
is
he
out
here
alone,
in
the
sun?”
she
asked
them.

“He
seems
to
like
the
warmth,
Princess,”
Ser
Jorah
said.
“His
eyes
follow
the
sun,
though
he
does
not
see
it.
He
can
walk
after
a
fashion.
He
will
go
where
you
lead
him,
but
no
farther.
He
will
eat
if
you
put
food
in
his
mouth,
drink
if
you
dribble
water
on
his
lips.”

Dany
kissed
her
sun-and-stars
gently
on
the
brow,
and
stood
to
face
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“Your
spells
are
costly,
maegi.”

“He
lives,”
said
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“You
asked
for
life.
You
paid
for
life.”

“This
is
not
life,
for
one
who
was
as
Drogo
was.
His
life
was
laughter,
and
meat
roasting
over
a
firepit,
and
a
horse
between
his
legs.
His
life
was
an
arakh
in
his
hand
and
his
bells
ringing
in
his
hair
as
he
rode
to
meet
an
enemy.
His
life
was
his
bloodriders,
and
me,
and
the
son
I
was
to
give
him.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
made
no
reply.

“When
will
he
be
as
he
was?”
Dany
demanded.

“When
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
and
sets
in
the
east,”
said
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
“When
the
seas
go
dry
and
mountains
blow
in
the
wind
like
leaves.
When
your
womb
quickens
again,
and
you
bear
a
living
child.
Then
he
will
return,
and
not
before.”

Dany
gestured
at
Ser
Jorah
and
the
others.
“Leave
us.
I
would
speak
with
this
maegi
alone.”
Mormont
and
the
Dothraki
withdrew.
“You
knew,”
Dany
said
when
they
were
gone.
She
ached,
inside
and
out,
but
her
fury
gave
her
strength.
“You
knew
what
I
was
buying,
and
you
knew
the
price,
and
yet
you
let
me
pay
it.”

“It
was
wrong
of
them
to
burn
my
temple,”
the
heavy,
flat-nosed
woman
said
placidly.
“That
angered
the
Great
Shepherd.”

“This
was
no
god’s
work,”
Dany
said
coldly.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“You
cheated
me.
You
murdered
my
child
within
me.”

“The
stallion
who
mounts
the
world
will
burn
no
cities
now.
His
khalasar
shall
trample
no
nations
into
dust.”

“I
spoke
for
you,”
she
said,
anguished.
“I
saved
you.”

“Saved
me?”
The
Lhazareen
woman
spat.
“Three
riders
had
taken
me,
not
as
a
man
takes
a
woman
but
from
behind,
as
a
dog
takes
a
bitch.
The
fourth
was
in
me
when
you
rode
past.
How
then
did
you
save
me?
I
saw
my
god’s
house
burn,
where
I
had
healed
good
men
beyond
counting.
My
home
they
burned
as
well,
and
in
the
street
I
saw
piles
of
heads.
I
saw
the
head
of
a
baker
who
made
my
bread.
I
saw
the
head
of
a
boy
I
had
saved
from
deadeye
fever,
only
three
moons
past.
I
heard
children
crying
as
the
riders
drove
them
off
with
their
whips.
Tell
me
again
what
you
saved.”

“Your
life.”

Mirri
Maz
Duur
laughed
cruelly.
“Look
to
your
khal
and
see
what
life
is
worth,
when
all
the
rest
is
gone.”

Dany
called
out
for
the
men
of
her
khas
and
bid
them
take
Mirri
Maz
Duur
and
bind
her
hand
and
foot,
but
the
maegi
smiled
at
her
as
they
carried
her
off,
as
if
they
shared
a
secret.
A
word,
and
Dany
could
have
her
head
off…
yet
then
what
would
she
have?
A
head?
If
life
was
worthless,
what
was
death?

They
led
Khal
Drogo
back
to
her
tent,
and
Dany
commanded
them
to
fill
a
tub,
and
this
time
there
was
no
blood
in
the
water.
She
bathed
him
herself,
washing
the
dirt
and
the
dust
from
his
arms
and
chest,
cleaning
his
face
with
a
soft
cloth,
soaping
his
long
black
hair
and
combing
the
knots
and
tangles
from
it
till
it
shone
again
as
she
remembered.
It
was
well
past
dark
before
she
was
done,
and
Dany
was
exhausted.
She
stopped
for
drink
and
food,
but
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
nibble
at
a
fig
and
keep
down
a
mouthful
of
water.
Sleep
would
have
been
a
release,
but
she
had
slept
enough…
too
long,
in
truth.
She
owed
this
night
to
Drogo,
for
all
the
nights
that
had
been,
and
yet
might
be.

The
memory
of
their
first
ride
was
with
her
when
she
led
him
out
into
the
darkness,
for
the
Dothraki
believed
that
all
things
of
importance
in
a
man’s
life
must
be
done
beneath
the
open
sky.
She
told
herself
that
there
were
powers
stronger
than
hatred,
and
spells
older
and
truer
than
any
the
maegi
had
learned
in
Asshai.
The
night
was
black
and
moonless,
but
overhead
a
million
stars
burned
bright.
She
took
that
for
an
omen.

No
soft
blanket
of
grass
welcomed
them
here,
only
the
hard
dusty
ground,
bare
and
strewn
with
stones.
No
trees
stirred
in
the
wind,
and
there
was
no
stream
to
soothe
her
fears
with
the
gentle
music
of
water.
Dany
told
herself
that
the
stars
would
be
enough.
“Remember,
Drogo,”
she
whispered.
“Remember
our
first
ride
together,
the
day
we
wed.
Remember
the
night
we
made
Rhaego,
with
the
khalasar
all
around
us
and
your
eyes
on
my
face.
Remember
how
cool
and
clean
the
water
was
in
the
Womb
of
the
World.
Remember,
my
sun-and-stars.
Remember,
and
come
back
to
me.”

The
birth
had
left
her
too
raw
and
torn
to
take
him
inside
of
her,
as
she
would
have
wanted,
but
Doreah
had
taught
her
other
ways.
Dany
used
her
hands,
her
mouth,
her
breasts.
She
raked
him
with
her
nails
and
covered
him
with
kisses
and
whispered
and
prayed
and
told
him
stories,
and
by
the
end
she
had
bathed
him
with
her
tears.
Yet
Drogo
did
not
feel,
or
speak,
or
rise.

And
when
the
bleak
dawn
broke
over
an
empty
horizon,
Dany
knew
that
he
was
truly
lost
to
her.
“When
the
sun
rises
in
the
west
and
sets
in
the
east,”
she
said
sadly.
“When
the
seas
go
dry
and
mountains
blow
in
the
wind
like
leaves.
When
my
womb
quickens
again,
and
I
bear
a
living
child.
Then
you
will
return,
my
sun-and-stars,
and
not
before.”

Never,
the
darkness
cried,
never
never
never.

Inside
the
tent
Dany
found
a
cushion,
soft
silk
stuffed
with
feathers.
She
clutched
it
to
her
breasts
as
she
walked
back
out
to
Drogo,
to
her
sun-and-stars.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
It
hurt
even
to
walk,
and
she
wanted
to
sleep,
to
sleep
and
not
to
dream.

She
knelt,
kissed
Drogo
on
the
lips,
and
pressed
the
cushion
down
across
his
face.

KING
OF
THE
ISLES

AND
THE
NORTH

The
Greyjoys
of
Pyke
claim
descent
from
the
Grey
King
of
the
Age
of
Heroes.
Legend
says
the
Grey
King
ruled
the
sea
itself
and
took
a
mermaid
to
wife.
Aegon
the
Dragon
ended
the
line
of
the
last
King
of
the
Iron
Islands,
but
allowed
the
ironborn
to
revive
their
ancient
custom
and
choose
who
should
have
the
primacy
among
them.
They
chose
Lord
Vickon
Greyjoy
of
Pyke.
The
Greyjoy
sigil
is
a
golden
kraken
upon
a
black
field.
Their
words
are
We
Do
Not
Sow.



Balon
Greyjoy’s
first
rebellion
against
the
Iron
Throne
was
put
down
by
King
Robert
I
Baratheon
and
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell,
but
in
the
chaos
following
Robert’s
death
Lord
Balon
named
himself
king
once
more,
and
sent
his
ships
to
attack
the
north.

HOUSE
FLORENT

The
Florents
of
Brightwater
Keep
are
bannermen
of
Highgarden.
At
the
outset
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings,
Lord
Alester
Florent
followed
his
liege
lord
in
declaring
for
King
Renly
while
his
brother
Ser
Axell
chose
Stannis,
husband
to
his
niece
Selyse.
After
Renly’s
death,
Lord
Alester
went
over
to
Stannis
as
well,
with
all
the
strength
of
Brightwater.
Stannis
made
Lord
Alester
his
Hand,
and
gave
command
of
his
fleet
to
Ser
Imry
Florent,
his
wife’s
brother.
The
fleet
and
Ser
Imry
both
were
lost
in
the
Battle
of
Blackwater,
and
Lord
Alester’s
efforts
to
negotiate
a
peace
after
the
defeat
were
regarded
by
King
Stannis
as
treason.
He
was
given
to
the
red
priestess
Melisandre,
who
burned
him
as
a
sacrifice
to
R’hllor.



The
Iron
Throne
has
also
named
the
Florents
traitors
for
their
support
of
Stannis
and
his
rebellion.
They
were
attainted,
and
Brightwater
Keep
and
its
lands
were
awarded
to
Ser
Garlan
Tyrell.



The
sigil
of
House
Florent
shows
a
fox
head
in
a
circle
of
flowers.

HOUSE
FREY

The
Freys
are
bannermen
to
House
Tully,
but
have
not
always
been
diligent
in
their
duty.
At
the
onset
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings,
Robb
Stark
won
Lord
Walder’s
allegiance
by
pledging
to
marry
one
of
his
daughters
or
granddaughters.
When
he
wed
Lady
Jeyne
Westerling
instead,
the
Freys
conspired
with
Roose
Bolton
and
murdered
the
Young
Wolf
and
his
followers
at
what
became
known
as
the
Red
Wedding.

HOUSE
HIGHTOWER

The
Hightowers
of
Oldtown
are
among
the
oldest
and
proudest
of
the
Great
Houses
of
Westeros,
tracing
their
descent
back
to
the
First
Men.
Once
kings,
they
have
ruled
Oldtown
and
its
environs
since
the
Dawn
of
Days,
welcoming
the
Andals
rather
than
resisting
them,
and
later
bending
the
knee
to
the
Kings
of
the
Reach
and
giving
up
their
crowns
whilst
retaining
all
their
ancient
privileges.
Though
powerful
and
immensely
wealthy,
the
Lords
of
the
High
Tower
have
traditionally
preferred
trade
to
battle,
and
have
seldom
played
a
large
part
in
the
wars
of
Westeros.
The
Hightowers
were
instrumental
in
the
founding
of
the
Citadel
and
continue
to
protect
it
to
this
day.
Subtle
and
sophisticated,
they
have
always
been
great
patrons
of
learning
and
the
Faith,
and
it
is
said
that
certain
of
them
have
also
dabbled
in
alchemy,
necromancy,
and
other
sorcerous
arts.



The
arms
of
House
Hightower
show
a
stepped
white
tower
crowned
with
fire
on
a
smoke-grey
field.
The
House
words
are
We
Light
the
Way.

HOUSE
LANNISTER

The
Lannisters
of
Casterly
Rock
remain
the
principal
support
of
King
Tommen’s
claim
to
the
Iron
Throne.
They
boast
of
descent
from
Lann
the
Clever,
the
legendary
trickster
of
the
Age
of
Heroes.
The
gold
of
Casterly
Rock
and
the
Golden
Tooth
has
made
them
the
wealthiest
of
the
Great
Houses.
The
Lannister
sigil
is
a
golden
lion
upon
a
crimson
field.
Their

HOUSE
MARTELL

Dorne
was
the
last
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
to
swear
fealty
to
the
Iron
Throne.
Blood,
custom,
geography,
and
history
all
helped
to
set
the
Dornishmen
apart
from
the
other
kingdoms.
At
the
outbreak
of
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings
Dorne
took
no
part,
but
when
Myrcella
Baratheon
was
betrothed
to
Prince
Trystane,
Sunspear
declared
its
support
for
King
Joffrey.
The
Martell
banner
is
a
red
sun
pierced
by
a
golden
spear.
Their
words
are
Unbowed,
Unbent,
Unbroken.

HOUSE
STARK

The
Starks
trace
their
descent
from
Brandon
the
Builder
and
the
Kings
of
Winter.
For
thousands
of
years,
they
ruled
from
Winterfell
as
Kings
in
the
North,
until
Torrhen
Stark,
the
King
Who
Knelt,
chose
to
swear
fealty
to
Aegon
the
Dragon
rather
than
give
battle.
When
Lord
Eddard
Stark
of
Winterfell
was
executed
by
King
Joffrey,
the
northmen
foreswore
their
loyalty
to
the
Iron
Throne
and
proclaimed
Lord
Eddard’s
son
Robb
as
King
in
the
North.
During
the
War
of
the
Five
Kings,
he
won
every
battle,
but
was
betrayed
and
murdered
by
the
Freys
and
Boltons
at
the
Twins
during
his
uncle’s
wedding.

TYRION

“They
have
my
son,”
Tywin
Lannister
said.

“They
do,
my
lord.”
The
messenger’s
voice
was
dulled
by
exhaustion.
On
the
breast
of
his
torn
surcoat,
the
brindled
boar
of
Crakehall
was
half-obscured
by
dried
blood.

One
of
your
sons,
Tyrion
thought.
He
took
a
sip
of
wine
and
said
not
a
word,
thinking
of
Jaime.
When
he
lifted
his
arm,
pain
shot
through
his
elbow,
reminding
him
of
his
own
brief
taste
of
battle.
He
loved
his
brother,
but
he
would
not
have
wanted
to
be
with
him
in
the
Whispering
Wood
for
all
the
gold
in
Casterly
Rock.

His
lord
father’s
assembled
captains
and
bannermen
had
fallen
very
quiet
as
the
courier
told
his
tale.
The
only
sound
was
the
crackle
and
hiss
of
the
log
burning
in
the
hearth
at
the
end
of
the
long,
drafty
common
room.

After
the
hardships
of
the
long
relentless
drive
south,
the
prospect
of
even
a
single
night
in
an
inn
had
cheered
Tyrion
mightily…
though
he
rather
wished
it
had
not
been
this
inn
again,
with
all
its
memories.
His
father
had
set
a
grueling
pace,
and
it
had
taken
its
toll.
Men
wounded
in
the
battle
kept
up
as
best
they
could
or
were
abandoned
to
fend
for
themselves.
Every
morning
they
left
a
few
more
by
the
roadside,
men
who
went
to
sleep
never
to
wake.
Every
afternoon
a
few
more
collapsed
along
the
way.
And
every
evening
a
few
more
deserted,
stealing
off
into
the
dusk.
Tyrion
had
been
half-tempted
to
go
with
them.

He
had
been
upstairs,
enjoying
the
comfort
of
a
featherbed
and
the
warmth
of
Shae’s
body
beside
him,
when
his
squire
had
woken
him
to
say
that
a
rider
had
arrived
with
dire
news
of
Riverrun.
So
it
had
all
been
for
nothing.
The
rush
south,
the
endless
forced
marches,
the
bodies
left
beside
the
road…
all
for
naught.
Robb
Stark
had
reached
Riverrun
days
and
days
ago.

“How
could
this
happen?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
moaned.
“How?
Even
after
the
Whispering
Wood,
you
had
Riverrun
ringed
in
iron,
surrounded
by
a
great
host…
what
madness
made
Ser
Jaime
decide
to
split
his
men
into
three
separate
camps?
Surely
he
knew
how
vulnerable
that
would
leave
them?”

Better
than
you,
you
chinless
craven,
Tyrion
thought.
Jaime
might
have
lost
Riverrun,
but
it
angered
him
to
hear
his
brother
slandered
by
the
likes
of
Swyft,
a
shameless
lickspittle
whose
greatest
accomplishment
was
marrying
his
equally
chinless
daughter
to
Ser
Kevan,
and
thereby
attaching
himself
to
the
Lannisters.

“I
would
have
done
the
same,”
his
uncle
responded,
a
good
deal
more
calmly
than
Tyrion
might
have.
“You
have
never
seen
Riverrun,
Ser
Harys,
or
you
would
know
that
Jaime
had
little
choice
in
the
matter.
The
castle
is
situated
at
the
end
of
the
point
of
land
where
the
Tumblestone
flows
into
the
Red
Fork
of
the
Trident.
The
rivers
form
two
sides
of
a
triangle,
and
when
danger
threatens,
the
Tullys
open
their
sluice
gates
upstream
to
create
a
wide
moat
on
the
third
side,
turning
Riverrun
into
an
island.
The
walls
rise
sheer
from
the
water,
and
from
their
towers
the
defenders
have
a
commanding
view
of
the
opposite
shores
for
many
leagues
around.
To
cut
off
all
the
approaches,
a
besieger
must
needs
place
one
camp
north
of
the
Tumblestone,
one
south
of
the
Red
Fork,
and
a
third
between
the
rivers,
west
of
the
moat.
There
is
no
other
way,
none.”

“Ser
Kevan
speaks
truly,
my
lords,”
the
courier
said.
“We’d
built
palisades
of
sharpened
stakes
around
the
camps,
yet
it
was
not
enough,
not
with
no
warning
and
the
rivers
cutting
us
off
from
each
other.
They
came
down
on
the
north
camp
first.
No
one
was
expecting
an
attack.
Marq
Piper
had
been
raiding
our
supply
trains,
but
he
had
no
more
than
fifty
men.
Ser
Jaime
had
gone
out
to
deal
with
them
the
night
before…
well,
with
what
we
thought
was
them.
We
were
told
the
Stark
host
was
east
of
the
Green
Fork,
marching
south…”

“And
your
outriders?”
Ser
Gregor
Clegane’s
face
might
have
been
hewn
from
rock.
The
fire
in
the
hearth
gave
a
somber
orange
cast
to
his
skin
and
put
deep
shadows
in
the
hollows
of
his
eyes.
“They
saw
nothing?
They
gave
you
no
warning?”

The
bloodstained
messenger
shook
his
head.
“Our
outriders
had
been
vanishing.
Marq
Piper’s
work,
we
thought.
The
ones
who
did
come
back
had
seen
nothing.”

“A
man
who
sees
nothing
has
no
use
for
his
eyes,”
the
Mountain
declared.
“Cut
them
out
and
give
them
to
your
next
outrider.
Tell
him
you
hope
that
four
eyes
might
see
better
than
two…
and
if
not,
the
man
after
him
will
have
six.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
turned
his
face
to
study
Ser
Gregor.
Tyrion
saw
a
glimmer
of
gold
as
the
light
shone
off
his
father’s
pupils,
but
he
could
not
have
said
whether
the
look
was
one
of
approval
or
disgust.
Lord
Tywin
was
oft
quiet
in
council,
preferring
to
listen
before
he
spoke,
a
habit
Tyrion
himself
tried
to
emulate.
Yet
this
silence
was
uncharacteristic
even
for
him,
and
his
wine
was
untouched.

“You
said
they
came
at
night,”
Ser
Kevan
prompted.

The
man
gave
a
weary
nod.
“The
Blackfish
led
the
van,
cutting
down
our
sentries
and
clearing
away
the
palisades
for
the
main
assault.
By
the
time
our
men
knew
what
was
happening,
riders
were
pouring
over
the
ditch
banks
and
galloping
through
the
camp
with
swords
and
torches
in
hand.
I
was
sleeping
in
the
west
camp,
between
the
rivers.
When
we
heard
the
fighting
and
saw
the
tents
being
fired,
Lord
Brax
led
us
to
the
rafts
and
we
tried
to
pole
across,
but
the
current
pushed
us
downstream
and
the
Tullys
started
flinging
rocks
at
us
with
the
catapults
on
their
walls.
I
saw
one
raft
smashed
to
kindling
and
three
others
overturned,
men
swept
into
the
river
and
drowned…
and
those
who
did
make
it
across
found
the
Starks
waiting
for
them
on
the
riverbanks.”

Ser
Flement
Brax
wore
a
silver-and-purple
tabard
and
the
look
of
a
man
who
cannot
comprehend
what
he
has
just
heard.
“My
lord
father—”

“Sorry,
my
lord,”
the
messenger
said.
“Lord
Brax
was
clad
in
plate-and-mail
when
his
raft
overturned.
He
was
very
gallant.”

He
was
a
fool,
Tyrion
thought,
swirling
his
cup
and
staring
down
into
the
winy
depths.
Crossing
a
river
at
night
on
a
crude
raft,
wearing
armor,
with
an
enemy
waiting
on
the
other
side—if
that
was
gallantry,
he
would
take
cowardice
every
time.
He
wondered
if
Lord
Brax
had
felt
especially
gallant
as
the
weight
of
his
steel
pulled
him
under
the
black
water.

“The
camp
between
the
rivers
was
overrun
as
well,”
the
messenger
was
saying.
“While
we
were
trying
to
cross,
more
Starks
swept
in
from
the
west,
two
columns
of
armored
horse.
I
saw
Lord
Umber’s
giant-in-chains
and
the
Mallister
eagle,
but
it
was
the
boy
who
led
them,
with
a
monstrous
wolf
running
at
his
side.
I
wasn’t
there
to
see,
but
it’s
said
the
beast
killed
four
men
and
ripped
apart
a
dozen
horses.
Our
spearmen
formed
up
a
shieldwall
and
held
against
their
first
charge,
but
when
the
Tullys
saw
them
engaged,
they
opened
the
gates
of
Riverrun
and
Tytos
Blackwood
led
a
sortie
across
the
drawbridge
and
took
them
in
the
rear.”

“Gods
save
us,”
Lord
Lefford
swore.

“Greatjon
Umber
fired
the
siege
towers
we
were
building,
and
Lord
Blackwood
found
Ser
Edmure
Tully
in
chains
among
the
other
captives,
and
made
off
with
them
all.
Our
south
camp
was
under
the
command
of
Ser
Forley
Prester.
He
retreated
in
good
order
when
he
saw
that
the
other
camps
were
lost,
with
two
thousand
spears
and
as
many
bowmen,
but
the
Tyroshi
sellsword
who
led
his
freeriders
struck
his
banners
and
went
over
to
the
foe.”

“Curse
the
man.”
His
uncle
Kevan
sounded
more
angry
than
surprised.
“I
warned
Jaime
not
to
trust
that
one.
A
man
who
fights
for
coin
is
loyal
only
to
his
purse.”

Lord
Tywin
wove
his
fingers
together
under
his
chin.
Only
his
eyes
moved
as
he
listened.
His
bristling
golden
side-whiskers
framed
a
face
so
still
it
might
have
been
a
mask,
but
Tyrion
could
see
tiny
beads
of
sweat
dappling
his
father’s
shaven
head.

“How
could
it
happen?”
Ser
Harys
Swyft
wailed
again.
“Ser
Jaime
taken,
the
siege
broken…
this
is
a
catastrophe!”

Ser
Addam
Marbrand
said,
“I
am
sure
we
are
all
grateful
to
you
for
pointing
out
the
obvious,
Ser
Harys.
The
question
is,
what
shall
we
do
about
it?”

“What
can
we
do?
Jaime’s
host
is
all
slaughtered
or
taken
or
put
to
flight,
and
the
Starks
and
the
Tullys
sit
squarely
across
our
line
of
supply.
We
are
cut
off
from
the
west!
They
can
march
on
Casterly
Rock
if
they
so
choose,
and
what’s
to
stop
them?
My
lords,
we
are
beaten.
We
must
sue
for
peace.”

“Peace?”
Tyrion
swirled
his
wine
thoughtfully,
took
a
deep
draft,
and
hurled
his
empty
cup
to
the
floor,
where
it
shattered
into
a
thousand
pieces.
“There’s
your
peace,
Ser
Harys.
My
sweet
nephew
broke
it
for
good
and
all
when
he
decided
to
ornament
the
Red
Keep
with
Lord
Eddard’s
head.
You’ll
have
an
easier
time
drinking
wine
from
that
cup
than
you
will
convincing
Robb
Stark
to
make
peace
now.
He’s
winning…
or
hadn’t
you
noticed?”

“Two
battles
do
not
make
a
war,”
Ser
Addam
insisted.
“We
are
far
from
lost.
I
should
welcome
the
chance
to
try
my
own
steel
against
this
Stark
boy.”

“Perhaps
they
would
consent
to
a
truce,
and
allow
us
to
trade
our
prisoners
for
theirs,”
offered
Lord
Lefford.

“Unless
they
trade
three-for-one,
we
still
come
out
light
on
those
scales,”
Tyrion
said
acidly.
“And
what
are
we
to
offer
for
my
brother?
Lord
Eddard’s
rotting
head?”

“I
had
heard
that
Queen
Cersei
has
the
Hand’s
daughters,”
Lefford
said
hopefully.
“If
we
give
the
lad
his
sisters
back…”

Ser
Addam
snorted
disdainfully.
“He
would
have
to
be
an
utter
ass
to
trade
Jaime
Lannister’s
life
for
two
girls.”

“Then
we
must
ransom
Ser
Jaime,
whatever
it
costs,”
Lord
Lefford
said.

Tyrion
rolled
his
eyes.
“If
the
Starks
feel
the
need
for
gold,
they
can
melt
down
Jaime’s
armor.”

“if
we
ask
for
a
truce,
they
will
think
us
weak,”
Ser
Addarn
argued.
“We
should
march
on
them
at
once.”

“Surely
our
friends
at
court
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
join
us
with
fresh
troops,”
said
Ser
Harys.
“And
someone
might
return
to
Casterly
Rock
to
raise
a
new
host.”

Lord
Tywin
Lannister
rose
to
his
feet.
“They
have
my
son,”
he
said
once
more,
in
a
voice
that
cut
through
the
babble
like
a
sword
through
suet.
“Leave
me.
All
of
you.”

Ever
the
soul
of
obedience,
Tyrion
rose
to
depart
with
the
rest,
but
his
father
gave
him
a
look.
“Not
you,
Tyrion.
Remain.
And
you
as
well,
Kevan.
The
rest
of
you,
out.”

Tyrion
eased
himself
back
onto
the
bench,
startled
into
speechlessness.
Ser
Kevan
crossed
the
room
to
the
wine
casks.
“Uncle,”
Tyrion
called,
“if
you
would
be
so
kind—”

“Here.”
His
father
offered
him
his
cup,
the
wine
untouched.

Now
Tyrion
truly
was
nonplussed.
He
drank.

Lord
Tywin
seated
himself.
“You
have
the
right
of
it
about
Stark.
Alive,
we
might
have
used
Lord
Eddard
to
forge
a
peace
with
Winterfell
and
Riverrun,
a
peace
that
would
have
given
us
the
time
we
need
to
deal
with
Robert’s
brothers.
Dead…”
His
hand
curled
into
a
fist.
“Madness.
Rank
madness.”

“Joff’s
only
a
boy,”
Tyrion
pointed
out.
“At
his
age,
I
committed
a
few
follies
of
my
own.”

His
father
gave
him
a
sharp
look.
“I
suppose
we
ought
to
be
grateful
that
he
has
not
yet
married
a
whore.”

Tyrion
sipped
at
his
wine,
wondering
how
Lord
Tywin
would
look
if
he
flung
the
cup
in
his
face.

“Our
position
is
worse
than
you
know,”
his
father
went
on.
“It
would
seem
we
have
a
new
king.”

Ser
Kevan
looked
poleaxed.
“A
new—who?
What
have
they
done
to
Joffrey?”

The
faintest
flicker
of
distaste
played
across
Lord
Tywin’s
thin
lips.
“Nothing…
yet.
My
grandson
still
sits
the
Iron
Throne,
but
the
eunuch
has
heard
whispers
from
the
south.
Renly
Baratheon
wed
Margaery
Tyrell
at
Highgarden
this
fortnight
past,
and
now
he
has
claimed
the
crown.
The
bride’s
father
and
brothers
have
bent
the
knee
and
sworn
him
their
swords.”

“Those
are
grave
tidings.”
When
Ser
Kevan
frowned,
the
furrows
in
his
brow
grew
deep
as
canyons.

“My
daughter
commands
us
to
ride
for
King’s
Landing
at
once,
to
defend
the
Red
Keep
against
King
Renly
and
the
Knight
of
Flowers.”
His
mouth
tightened.
“Commands
us,
mind
you.
In
the
name
of
the
king
and
council.”

“How
is
King
Joffrey
taking
the
news?”
Tyrion
asked
with
a
certain
black
amusement.

“Cersei
has
not
seen
fit
to
tell
him
yet,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“She
fears
he
might
insist
on
marching
against
Renly
himself.”

“With
what
army?”
Tyrion
asked.
“You
don’t
plan
to
give
him
this
one,
I
hope?”

“He
talks
of
leading
the
City
Watch,”
Lord
Tywin
said.

“If
he
takes
the
Watch,
he’ll
leave
the
city
undefended,”
Ser
Kevan
said.
“And
with
Lord
Stannis
on
Dragonstone…”

“Yes.”
Lord
Tywin
looked
down
at
his
son.
“I
had
thought
you
were
the
one
made
for
motley,
Tyrion,
but
it
would
appear
that
I
was
wrong.”

“Why,
Father,”
said
Tyrion,
“that
almost
sounds
like
praise.”
He
leaned
forward
intently.
“What
of
Stannis?
He’s
the
elder,
not
Renly.
How
does
he
feel
about
his
brother’s
claim?”

His
father
frowned.
“I
have
felt
from
the
beginning
that
Stannis
was
a
greater
danger
than
all
the
others
combined.
Yet
he
does
nothing.
Oh,
Varys
hears
his
whispers.
Stannis
is
building
ships,
Stannis
is
hiring
sellswords,
Stannis
is
bringing
a
shadowbinder
from
Asshai.
What
does
it
mean?
Is
any
of
it
true?”
He
gave
an
irritated
shrug.
“Kevan,
bring
us
the
map.”

Ser
Kevan
did
as
he
was
bid.
Lord
Tywin
unrolled
the
leather,
smoothing
it
flat.
“Jaime
has
left
us
in
a
bad
way.
Roose
Bolton
and
the
remnants
of
his
host
are
north
of
us.
Our
enemies
hold
the
Twins
and
Moat
Cailin.
Robb
Stark
sits
to
the
west,
so
we
cannot
retreat
to
Lannisport
and
the
Rock
unless
we
choose
to
give
battle.
Jaime
is
taken,
and
his
army
for
all
purposes
has
ceased
to
exist.
Thoros
of
Myr
and
Beric
Dondarrion
continue
to
plague
our
foraging
parties.
To
our
east
we
have
the
Arryns,
Stannis
Baratheon
sits
on
Dragonstone,
and
in
the
south
Highgarden
and
Storm’s
End
are
calling
their
banners.”

Tyrion
smiled
crookedly.
“Take
heart,
Father.
At
least
Rhaegar
Targaryen
is
still
dead.”

“I
had
hoped
you
might
have
more
to
offer
us
than
japes,
Tyrion,”
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
said.

Ser
Kevan
frowned
over
the
map,
forehead
creasing.
“Robb
Stark
will
have
Edmure
Tully
and
the
lords
of
the
Trident
with
him
now.
Their
combined
power
may
exceed
our
own.
And
with
Roose
Bolton
behind
us…
Tywin,
if
we
remain
here,
I
fear
we
might
be
caught
between
three
armies.”

“I
have
no
intention
of
remaining
here.
We
must
finish
our
business
with
young
Lord
Stark
before
Renly
Baratheon
can
march
from
Highgarden.
Bolton
does
not
concern
me.
He
is
a
wary
man,
and
we
made
him
warier
on
the
Green
Fork.
He
will
be
slow
to
give
pursuit.
So…
on
the
morrow,
we
make
for
Harrenhal.
Kevan,
I
want
Ser
Addam’s
outriders
to
screen
our
movements.
Give
him
as
many
men
as
he
requires,
and
send
them
out
in
groups
of
four.
I
will
have
no
vanishings.”

“As
you
say,
my
lord,
but…
why
Harrenhal?
That
is
a
grim,
unlucky
place.
Some
call
it
cursed.”

“Let
them,”
Lord
Tywin
said.
“Unleash
Ser
Gregor
and
send
him
before
us
with
his
reavers.
Send
forth
Vargo
Hoat
and
his
freeriders
as
well,
and
Ser
Amory
Lorch.
Each
is
to
have
three
hundred
horse.
Tell
them
I
want
to
see
the
riverlands
afire
from
the
Gods
Eye
to
the
Red
Fork.”

“They
will
burn,
my
lord,”
Ser
Kevan
said,
rising.
“I
shall
give
the
commands.”
He
bowed
and
made
for
the
door.

When
they
were
alone,
Lord
Tywin
glanced
at
Tyrion.
“Your
savages
might
relish
a
bit
of
rapine.
Tell
them
they
may
ride
with
Vargo
Hoat
and
plunder
as
they
like—goods,
stock,
women,
they
may
take
what
they
want
and
burn
the
rest.”

“Telling
Shagga
and
Timett
how
to
pillage
is
like
telling
a
rooster
how
to
crow,”
Tyrion
commented,
“but
I
should
prefer
to
keep
them
with
me.”
Uncouth
and
unruly
they
might
be,
yet
the
wildlings
were
his,
and
he
trusted
them
more
than
any
of
his
father’s
men.
He
was
not
about
to
hand
them
over.

“Then
you
had
best
learn
to
control
them.
I
will
not
have
the
city
plundered.”

“The
city?”
Tyrion
was
lost.
“What
city
would
that
be?”

“King’s
Landing.
I
am
sending
you
to
court.”

It
was
the
last
thing
Tyrion
Lannister
would
ever
have
anticipated.

He
reached
for
his
wine,
and
considered
for
a
moment
as
he
sipped.
“And
what
am
I
to
do
there?”

“Rule,”
his
father
said
curtly.

Tyrion
hooted
with
laughter.
“My
sweet
sister
might
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
about
that!”

“Let
her
say
what
she
likes.
Her
son
needs
to
be
taken
in
hand
before
he
ruins
us
all.
I
blame
those
jackanapes
on
the
council—our
friend
Petyr,
the
venerable
Grand
Maester,
and
that
cockless
wonder
Lord
Varys.
What
sort
of
counsel
are
they
giving
Joffrey
when
he
lurches
from
one
folly
to
the
next?
Whose
notion
was
it
to
make
this
Janos
Slynt
a
lord?
The
man’s
father
was
a
butcher,
and
they
grant
him
Harrenhal.
Harrenhal,
that
was
the
seat
of
kings!
Not
that
he
will
ever
set
foot
inside
it,
if
I
have
a
say.
I
am
told
he
took
a
bloody
spear
for
his
sigil.
A
bloody
cleaver
would
have
been
my
choice.”
His
father
had
not
raised
his
voice,
yet
Tyrion
could
see
the
anger
in
the
gold
of
his
eyes.
“And
dismissing
Selmy,
where
was
the
sense
in
that?
Yes,
the
man
was
old,
but
the
name
of
Barristan
the
Bold
still
has
meaning
in
the
realm.
He
lent
honor
to
any
man
he
served.
Can
anyone
say
the
same
of
the
Hound?
You
feed
your
dog
bones
under
the
table,
you
do
not
seat
him
beside
you
on
the
high
bench.”
He
pointed
a
finger
at
Tyrion’s
face.
“If
Cersei
cannot
curb
the
boy,
you
must.
And
if
these
councillors
are
playing
us
false…”

Tyrion
knew.
“Spikes,”
he
sighed.
“Heads.
Walls.”

“I
see
you
have
taken
a
few
lessons
from
me.”

“More
than
you
know,
Father,”
Tyrion
answered
quietly.
He
finished
his
wine
and
set
the
cup
aside,
thoughtful.
A
part
of
him
was
more
pleased
than
he
cared
to
admit.
Another
part
was
remembering
the
battle
upriver,
and
wondering
if
he
was
being
sent
to
hold
the
left
again.
“Why
me?”
he
asked,
cocking
his
head
to
one
side.
“Why
not
my
uncle?
Why
not
Ser
Addam
or
Ser
Flement
or
Lord
Serrett?
Why
not
a…
bigger
man?”

Lord
Tywin
rose
abruptly.
“You
are
my
son.”

That
was
when
he
knew.
You
have
given
him
up
for
lost,
he
thought.
You
bloody
bastard,
you
think
Jaime’s
good
as
dead,
so
I’m
all
you
have
left.
Tyrion
wanted
to
slap
him,
to
spit
in
his
face,
to
draw
his
dagger
and
cut
the
heart
out
of
him
and
see
if
it
was
made
of
old
hard
gold,
the
way
the
smallfolks
said.
Yet
he
sat
there,
silent
and
still.

The
shards
of
the
broken
cup
crunched
beneath
his
father’s
heels
as
Lord
Tywin
crossed
the
room.
“One
last
thing,”
he
said
at
the
door.
“You
will
not
take
the
whore
to
court.”

Tyrion
sat
alone
in
the
common
room
for
a
long
while
after
his
father
was
gone.
Finally
he
climbed
the
steps
to
his
cozy
garret
beneath
the
bell
tower.
The
ceiling
was
low,
but
that
was
scarcely
a
drawback
for
a
dwarf.
From
the
window,
he
could
see
the
gibbet
his
father
had
erected
in
the
yard.
The
innkeep’s
body
turned
slowly
on
its
rope
whenever
the
night
wind
gusted.
Her
flesh
had
grown
as
thin
and
ragged
as
Lannister
hopes.

Shae
murmured
sleepily
and
rolled
toward
him
when
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
featherbed.
He
slid
his
hand
under
the
blanket
and
cupped
a
soft
breast,
and
her
eyes
opened.
“M’lord,”
she
said
with
a
drowsy
smile.

When
he
felt
her
nipple
stiffen,
Tyrion
kissed
her.
“I
have
a
mind
to
take
you
to
King’s
Landing,
sweetling,”
he
whispered.





JON

The
mare
whickered
softly
as
Jon
Snow
tightened
the
cinch.
“Easy,
sweet
lady,”
he
said
in
a
soft
voice,
quieting
her
with
a
touch.
Wind
whispered
through
the
stable,
a
cold
dead
breath
on
his
face,
but
Jon
paid
it
no
mind.
He
strapped
his
roll
to
the
saddle,
his
scarred
fingers
stiff
and
clumsy.
“Ghost,”
he
called
softly,
“to
me.”
And
the
wolf
was
there,
eyes
like
embers.

“Jon,
please.
You
must
not
do
this.”

He
mounted,
the
reins
in
his
hand,
and
wheeled
the
horse
around
to
face
the
night.
Samwell
Tarly
stood
in
the
stable
door,
a
full
moon
peering
over
his
shoulder.
He
threw
a
giant’s
shadow,
immense
and
black.
“Get
out
of
my
way,
Sam.”

“Jon,
you
can’t,”
Sam
said.
“I
won’t
let
you.”

“I
would
sooner
not
hurt
you,”
Jon
told
him.
“Move
aside,
Sam,
or
I’ll
ride
you
down.”

“You
won’t.
You
have
to
listen
to
me.
Please…”

Jon
put
his
spurs
to
horseflesh,
and
the
mare
bolted
for
the
door.
For
an
instant
Sam
stood
his
ground,
his
face
as
round
and
pale
as
the
moon
behind
him,
his
mouth
a
widening
O
of
surprise.
At
the
last
moment,
when
they
were
almost
on
him,
he
jumped
aside
as
Jon
had
known
he
would,
stumbled,
and
fell.
The
mare
leapt
over
him,
out
into
the
night.

Jon
raised
the
hood
of
his
heavy
cloak
and
gave
the
horse
her
head.
Castle
Black
was
silent
and
still
as
he
rode
out,
with
Ghost
racing
at
his
side.
Men
watched
from
the
Wall
behind
him,
he
knew,
but
their
eyes
were
turned
north,
not
south.
No
one
would
see
him
go,
no
one
but
Sam
Tarly,
struggling
back
to
his
feet
in
the
dust
of
the
old
stables.
He
hoped
Sam
hadn’t
hurt
himself,
falling
like
that.
He
was
so
heavy
and
so
ungainly,
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
break
a
wrist
or
twist
his
ankle
getting
out
of
the
way.
“I
warned
him,”
Jon
said
aloud.
“It
was
nothing
to
do
with
him,
anyway.”
He
flexed
his
burned
hand
as
he
rode,
opening
and
closing
the
scarred
fingers.
They
still
pained
him,
but
it
felt
good
to
have
the
wrappings
off.

Moonlight
silvered
the
hills
as
he
followed
the
twisting
ribbon
of
the
kingsroad.
He
needed
to
get
as
far
from
the
Wall
as
he
could
before
they
realized
he
was
gone.
On
the
morrow
he
would
leave
the
road
and
strike
out
overland
through
field
and
bush
and
stream
to
throw
off
pursuit,
but
for
the
moment
speed
was
more
important
than
deception.
It
was
not
as
though
they
would
not
guess
where
he
was
going.

The
Old
Bear
was
accustomed
to
rise
at
first
light,
so
Jon
had
until
dawn
to
put
as
many
leagues
as
he
could
between
him
and
the
Wall…
if
Sam
Tarly
did
not
betray
him.
The
fat
boy
was
dutiful
and
easily
frightened,
but
he
loved
Jon
like
a
brother.
If
questioned,
Sam
would
doubtless
tell
them
the
truth,
but
Jon
could
not
imagine
him
braving
the
guards
in
front
of
the
King’s
Tower
to
wake
Mormont
from
sleep.

When
Jon
did
not
appear
to
fetch
the
Old
Bear’s
breakfast
from
the
kitchen,
they’d
look
in
his
cell
and
find
Longclaw
on
the
bed.
It
had
been
hard
to
abandon
it,
but
Jon
was
not
so
lost
to
honor
as
to
take
it
with
him.
Even
Jorah
Mormont
had
not
done
that,
when
he
fled
in
disgrace.
Doubtless
Lord
Mormont
would
find
someone
more
worthy
of
the
blade.
Jon
felt
bad
when
he
thought
of
the
old
man.
He
knew
his
desertion
would
be
salt
in
the
still-raw
wound
of
his
son’s
disgrace.
That
seemed
a
poor
way
to
repay
him
for
his
trust,
but
it
couldn’t
be
helped.
No
matter
what
he
did,
Jon
felt
as
though
he
were
betraying
someone.

Even
now,
he
did
not
know
if
he
was
doing
the
honorable
thing.
The
southron
had
it
easier.
They
had
their
septons
to
talk
to,
someone
to
tell
them
the
gods’
will
and
help
sort
out
right
from
wrong.
But
the
Starks
worshiped
the
old
gods,
the
nameless
gods,
and
if
the
heart
trees
heard,
they
did
not
speak.

When
the
last
lights
of
Castle
Black
vanished
behind
him,
Jon
slowed
his
mare
to
a
walk.
He
had
a
long
journey
ahead
and
only
the
one
horse
to
see
him
through.
There
were
holdfasts
and
farming
villages
along
the
road
south
where
he
might
be
able
to
trade
the
mare
for
a
fresh
mount
when
he
needed
one,
but
not
if
she
were
injured
or
blown.

He
would
need
to
find
new
clothes
soon;
most
like,
he’d
need
to
steal
them.
He
was
clad
in
black
from
head
to
heel;
high
leather
riding
boots,
roughspun
breeches
and
tunic,
sleeveless
leather
jerkin,
and
heavy
wool
cloak.
His
longsword
and
dagger
were
sheathed
in
black
moleskin,
and
the
hauberk
and
coif
in
his
saddlebag
were
black
ringmail.
Any
bit
of
it
could
mean
his
death
if
he
were
taken.
A
stranger
wearing
black
was
viewed
with
cold
suspicion
in
every
village
and
holdfast
north
of
the
Neck,
and
men
would
soon
be
watching
for
him.
Once
Maester
Aemon’s
ravens
took
flight,
Jon
knew
he
would
find
no
safe
haven.
Not
even
at
Winterfell.
Bran
might
want
to
let
him
in,
but
Maester
Luwin
had
better
sense.
He
would
bar
the
gates
and
send
Jon
away,
as
he
should.
Better
not
to
call
there
at
all.

Yet
he
saw
the
castle
clear
in
his
mind’s
eye,
as
if
he
had
left
it
only
yesterday;
the
towering
granite
walls,
the
Great
Hall
with
its
smells
of
smoke
and
dog
and
roasting
meat,
his
father’s
solar,
the
turret
room
where
he
had
slept.
Part
of
him
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
hear
Bran
laugh
again,
to
sup
on
one
of
Gage’s
beef-and-bacon
pies,
to
listen
to
Old
Nan
tell
her
tales
of
the
children
of
the
forest
and
Florian
the
Fool.

But
he
had
not
left
the
Wall
for
that;
he
had
left
because
he
was
after
all
his
father’s
son,
and
Robb’s
brother.
The
gift
of
a
sword,
even
a
sword
as
fine
as
Longclaw,
did
not
make
him
a
Mormont.
Nor
was
he
Aemon
Targaryen.
Three
times
the
old
man
had
chosen,
and
three
times
he
had
chosen
honor,
but
that
was
him.
Even
now,
Jon
could
not
decide
whether
the
maester
had
stayed
because
he
was
weak
and
craven,
or
because
he
was
strong
and
true.
Yet
he
understood
what
the
old
man
had
meant,
about
the
pain
of
choosing;
he
understood
that
all
too
well.

Tyrion
Lannister
had
claimed
that
most
men
would
rather
deny
a
hard
truth
than
face
it,
but
Jon
was
done
with
denials.
He
was
who
he
was;
Jon
Snow,
bastard
and
oathbreaker,
motherless,
friendless,
and
damned.
For
the
rest
of
his
life—however
long
that
might
be—he
would
be
condemned
to
be
an
outsider,
the
silent
man
standing
in
the
shadows
who
dares
not
speak
his
true
name.
Wherever
he
might
go
throughout
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
he
would
need
to
live
a
lie,
lest
every
man’s
hand
be
raised
against
him.
But
it
made
no
matter,
so
long
as
he
lived
long
enough
to
take
his
place
by
his
brother’s
side
and
help
avenge
his
father.

He
remembered
Robb
as
he
had
last
seen
him,
standing
in
the
yard
with
snow
melting
in
his
auburn
hair.
Jon
would
have
to
come
to
him
in
secret,
disguised.
He
tried
to
imagine
the
look
on
Robb’s
face
when
he
revealed
himself.
His
brother
would
shake
his
head
and
smile,
and
he’d
say…
he’d
say…

He
could
not
see
the
smile.
Hard
as
he
tried,
he
could
not
see
it.
He
found
himself
thinking
of
the
deserter
his
father
had
beheaded
the
day
they’d
found
the
direwolves.
“You
said
the
words,”
Lord
Eddard
had
told
him.
“You
took
a
vow,
before
your
brothers,
before
the
old
gods
and
the
new.”
Desmond
and
Fat
Tom
had
dragged
the
man
to
the
stump.
Bran’s
eyes
had
been
wide
as
saucers,
and
Jon
had
to
remind
him
to
keep
his
pony
in
hand.
He
remembered
the
look
on
Father’s
face
when
Theon
Greyjoy
brought
forth
Ice,
the
spray
of
blood
on
the
snow,
the
way
Theon
had
kicked
the
head
when
it
came
rolling
at
his
feet.

He
wondered
what
Lord
Eddard
might
have
done
if
the
deserter
had
been
his
brother
Benjen
instead
of
that
ragged
stranger.
Would
it
have
been
any
different?
It
must,
surely,
surely…
and
Robb
would
welcome
him,
for
a
certainty.
He
had
to,
or
else…

It
did
not
bear
thinking
about.
Pain
throbbed,
deep
in
his
fingers,
as
he
clutched
the
reins.
Jon
put
his
heels
into
his
horse
and
broke
into
a
gallop,
racing
down
the
kingsroad,
as
if
to
outrun
his
doubts.
Jon
was
not
afraid
of
death,
but
he
did
not
want
to
die
like
that,
trussed
and
bound
and
beheaded
like
a
common
brigand.
If
he
must
perish,
let
it
be
with
a
sword
in
his
hand,
fighting
his
father’s
killers.
He
was
no
true
Stark,
had
never
been
one…
but
he
could
die
like
one.
Let
them
say
that
Eddard
Stark
had
fathered
four
sons,
not
three.

Ghost
kept
pace
with
them
for
almost
half
a
mile,
red
tongue
lolling
from
his
mouth.
Man
and
horse
alike
lowered
their
heads
as
he
asked
the
mare
for
more
speed.
The
wolf
slowed,
stopped,
watching,
his
eyes
glowing
red
in
the
moonlight.
He
vanished
behind,
but
Jon
knew
he
would
follow,
at
his
own
pace.

Scattered
lights
flickered
through
the
trees
ahead
of
him,
on
both
sides
of
the
road:
Mole’s
Town.
A
dog
barked
as
he
rode
through,
and
he
heard
a
mule’s
raucous
haw
from
the
stable,
but
otherwise
the
village
was
still.
Here
and
there
the
glow
of
hearth
fires
shone
through
shuttered
windows,
leaking
between
wooden
slats,
but
only
a
few.

Mole’s
Town
was
bigger
than
it
seemed,
but
three
quarters
of
it
was
under
the
ground,
in
deep
warm
cellars
connected
by
a
maze
of
tunnels.
Even
the
whorehouse
was
down
there,
nothing
on
the
surface
but
a
wooden
shack
no
bigger
than
a
privy,
with
a
red
lantern
hung
over
the
door.
On
the
Wall,
he’d
heard
men
call
the
whores
“buried
treasures.”
He
wondered
whether
any
of
his
brothers
in
black
were
down
there
tonight,
mining.
That
was
oathbreaking
too,
yet
no
one
seemed
to
care.

Not
until
he
was
well
beyond
the
village
did
Jon
slow
again.
By
then
both
he
and
the
mare
were
damp
with
sweat.
He
dismounted,
shivering,
his
burned
hand
aching.
A
bank
of
melting
snow
lay
under
the
trees,
bright
in
the
moonlight,
water
trickling
off
to
form
small
shallow
pools.
Jon
squatted
and
brought
his
hands
together,
cupping
the
runoff
between
his
fingers.
The
snowmelt
was
icy
cold.
He
drank,
and
splashed
some
on
his
face,
until
his
cheeks
tingled.
His
fingers
were
throbbing
worse
than
they
had
in
days,
and
his
head
was
pounding
too.
I
am
doing
the
right
thing,
he
told
himself,
so
why
do
I
feel
so
bad?

The
horse
was
well
lathered,
so
Jon
took
the
lead
and
walked
her
for
a
while.
The
road
was
scarcely
wide
enough
for
two
riders
to
pass
abreast,
its
surface
cut
by
tiny
streams
and
littered
with
stone.
That
run
had
been
truly
stupid,
an
invitation
to
a
broken
neck.
Jon
wondered
what
had
gotten
into
him.
Was
he
in
such
a
great
rush
to
die?

Off
in
the
trees,
the
distant
scream
of
some
frightened
animal
made
him
look
up.
His
mare
whinnied
nervously.
Had
his
wolf
found
some
prey?
He
cupped
his
hands
around
his
mouth.
“Ghost!”
he
shouted.
“Ghost,
to
me.”
The
only
answer
was
a
rush
of
wings
behind
him
as
an
owl
took
flight.

Frowning,
Jon
continued
on
his
way.
He
led
the
mare
for
half
an
hour,
until
she
was
dry.
Ghost
did
not
appear.
Jon
wanted
to
mount
up
and
ride
again,
but
he
was
concerned
about
his
missing
wolf.
“Ghost,”
he
called
again.
“Where
are
you?
To
me!
Ghost!”
Nothing
in
these
woods
could
trouble
a
direwolf,
even
a
half-grown
direwolf,
unless…
no,
Ghost
was
too
smart
to
attack
a
bear,
and
if
there
was
a
wolf
pack
anywhere
close
Jon
would
have
surely
heard
them
howling.

He
should
eat,
he
decided.
Food
would
settle
his
stomach
and
give
Ghost
the
chance
to
catch
up.
There
was
no
danger
yet;
Castle
Black
still
slept.
In
his
saddlebag,
he
found
a
biscuit,
a
piece
of
cheese,
and
a
small
withered
brown
apple.
He’d
brought
salt
beef
as
well,
and
a
rasher
of
bacon
he’d
filched
from
the
kitchens,
but
he
would
save
the
meat
for
the
morrow.
After
it
was
gone
he’d
need
to
hunt,
and
that
would
slow
him.

Jon
sat
under
the
trees
and
ate
his
biscuit
and
cheese
while
his
mare
grazed
along
the
kingsroad.
He
kept
the
apple
for
last.
It
had
gone
a
little
soft,
but
the
flesh
was
still
tart
and
juicy.
He
was
down
to
the
core
when
he
heard
the
sounds:
horses,
and
from
the
north.
Quickly
Jon
leapt
up
and
strode
to
his
mare.
Could
he
outrun
them?
No,
they
were
too
close,
they’d
hear
him
for
a
certainty,
and
if
they
were
from
Castle
Black…

He
led
the
mare
off
the
road,
behind
a
thick
stand
of
grey-green
sentinels.
“Ouiet
now,”
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice,
crouching
down
to
peer
through
the
branches.
If
the
gods
were
kind,
the
riders
would
pass
by.
Likely
as
not,
they
were
only
smallfolk
from
Mole’s
Town,
farmers
on
their
way
to
their
fields,
although
what
they
were
doing
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night…

He
listened
to
the
sound
of
hooves
growing
steadily
louder
as
they
trotted
briskly
down
the
kingsroad.
From
the
sound,
there
were
five
or
six
of
them
at
the
least.
Their
voices
drifted
through
the
trees.

“…certain
he
came
this
way?”

“We
can’t
be
certain.”

“He
could
have
ridden
east,
for
all
you
know.
Or
left
the
road
to
cut
through
the
woods.
That’s
what
I’d
do.”

“In
the
dark?
Stupid.
If
you
didn’t
fall
off
your
horse
and
break
your
neck,
you’d
get
lost
and
wind
up
back
at
the
Wall
when
the
sun
came
up.”

“I
would
not.”
Grenn
sounded
peeved.
“I’d
just
ride
south,
you
can
tell
south
by
the
stars.”

“What
if
the
sky
was
cloudy?”
Pyp
asked.

“Then
I
wouldn’t
go.”

Another
voice
broke
in.
“You
know
where
I’d
be
if
it
was
me?
I’d
be
in
Mole’s
Town,
digging
for
buried
treasure.”
Toad’s
shrill
laughter
boomed
through
the
trees.
Jon’s
mare
snorted.

“Keep
quiet,
all
of
you,”
Haider
said.
“I
thought
I
heard
something.”

“Where?
I
didn’t
hear
anything.”
The
horses
stopped.

“You
can’t
hear
yourself
fart.”

“I
can
too,”
Grenn
insisted.

“Quiet!”

They
all
fell
silent,
listening.
Jon
found
himself
holding
his
breath.
Sam,
he
thought.
He
hadn’t
gone
to
the
Old
Bear,
but
he
hadn’t
gone
to
bed
either,
he’d
woken
the
other
boys.
Damn
them
all.
Come
dawn,
if
they
were
not
in
their
beds,
they’d
be
named
deserters
too.
What
did
they
think
they
were
doing?

The
hushed
silence
seemed
to
stretch
on
and
on.
From
where
Jon
crouched,
he
could
see
the
legs
of
their
horses
through
the
branches.
Finally
Pyp
spoke
up.
“What
did
you
hear?”

“I
don’t
know,”
Haider
admitted.
“A
sound,
I
thought
it
might
have
been
a
horse
but…”

“There’s
nothing
here.”

Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye,
Jon
glimpsed
a
pale
shape
moving
through
the
trees.
Leaves
rustled,
and
Ghost
came
bounding
out
of
the
shadows,
so
suddenly
that
Jon’s
mare
started
and
gave
a
whinny.
“There!”
Halder
shouted.

“I
heard
it
too!”

“Traitor,”
Jon
told
the
direwolf
as
he
swung
up
into
the
saddle.
He
turned
the
mare’s
head
to
slide
off
through
the
trees,
but
they
were
on
him
before
he
had
gone
ten
feet.

“Jon!”
Pyp
shouted
after
him.

“Pull
up,”
Grenn
said.
“You
can’t
outrun
us
all.”

Jon
wheeled
around
to
face
them,
drawing
his
sword.
“Get
back.
I
don’t
wish
to
hurt
you,
but
I
will
if
I
have
to.”

“One
against
seven?”
Halder
gave
a
signal.
The
boys
spread
out,
surrounding
him.

“What
do
you
want
with
me?”
Jon
demanded.

“We
want
to
take
you
back
where
you
belong,”
Pyp
said.

“I
belong
with
my
brother.”

“We’re
your
brothers
now,”
Grenn
said.

“They’ll
cut
off
your
head
if
they
catch
you,
you
know,”
Toad
put
in
with
a
nervous
laugh.
“This
is
so
stupid,
it’s
like
something
the
Aurochs
would
do.”

“I
would
not,”
Grenn
said.
“I’m
no
oathbreaker.
I
said
the
words
and
I
meant
them.”

“So
did
I,”
Jon
told
them.
“Don’t
you
understand?
They
murdered
my
father.
It’s
war,
my
brother
Robb
is
fighting
in
the
riverlands—”

“We
know,”
said
Pyp
solemnly.
“Sam
told
us
everything.”

“We’re
sorry
about
your
father,”
Grenn
said,
“but
it
doesn’t
matter.
Once
you
say
the
words,
you
can’t
leave,
no
matter
what.”

“I
have
to,”
Jon
said
fervently.

“You
said
the
words,”
Pyp
reminded
him.
“Now
my
watch
begins,
you
said
it.
It
shall
not
end
until
my
death.”

“I
shall
live
and
die
at
my
post,”
Grenn
added,
nodding.

“You
don’t
have
to
tell
me
the
words,
I
know
them
as
well
as
you
do.”
He
was
angry
now.
Why
couldn’t
they
let
him
go
in
peace?
They
were
only
making
it
harder.

“I
am
the
sword
in
the
darkness,”
Halder
intoned.

“The
watcher
on
the
walls,”
piped
Toad.

Jon
cursed
them
all
to
their
faces.
They
took
no
notice.
Pyp
spurred
his
horse
closer,
reciting,
“I
am
the
fire
that
burns
against
the
cold,
the
light
that
brings
the
dawn,
the
horn
that
wakes
the
sleepers,
the
shield
that
guards
the
realms
of
men.”

“Stay
back,”
Jon
warned
him,
brandishing
his
sword.
“I
mean
it,
Pyp.”
They
weren’t
even
wearing
armor,
he
could
cut
them
to
pieces
if
he
had
to.

Matthar
had
circled
behind
him.
He
joined
the
chorus.
“I
pledge
my
life
and
honor
to
the
Night’s
Watch.”

Jon
kicked
his
mare,
spinning
her
in
a
circle.
The
boys
were
all
around
him
now,
closing
from
every
side.

“For
this
night…”
Halder
trotted
in
from
the
left.

“…and
all
the
nights
to
come,”
finished
Pyp.
He
reached
over
for
Jon’s
reins.
“So
here
are
your
choices.
Kill
me,
or
come
back
with
me.”

Jon
lifted
his
sword…
and
lowered
it,
helpless.
“Damn
you,”
he
said.
“Damn
you
all.”

“Do
we
have
to
bind
your
hands,
or
will
you
give
us
your
word
you’ll
ride
back
peaceful?”
asked
Halder.

“I
won’t
run,
if
that’s
what
you
mean.”
Ghost
moved
out
from
under
the
trees
and
Jon
glared
at
him.
“Small
help
you
were,”
he
said.
The
deep
red
eyes
looked
at
him
knowingly.

“We
had
best
hurry,”
Pyp
said.
“If
we’re
not
back
before
first
light,
the
Old
Bear
will
have
all
our
heads.”

Of
the
ride
back,
Jon
Snow
remembered
little.
It
seemed
shorter
than
the
journey
south,
perhaps
because
his
mind
was
elsewhere.
Pyp
set
the
pace,
galloping,
walking,
trotting,
and
then
breaking
into
another
gallop.
Mole’s
Town
came
and
went,
the
red
lantern
over
the
brothel
long
extinguished.
They
made
good
time.
Dawn
was
still
an
hour
off
when
Jon
glimpsed
the
towers
of
Castle
Black
ahead
of
them,
dark
against
the
pale
immensity
of
the
Wall.
It
did
not
seem
like
home
this
time.

They
could
take
him
back,
Jon
told
himself,
but
they
could
not
make
him
stay.
The
war
would
not
end
on
the
morrow,
or
the
day
after,
and
his
friends
could
not
watch
him
day
and
night.
He
would
bide
his
time,
make
them
think
he
was
content
to
remain
here…
and
then,
when
they
had
grown
lax,
he
would
be
off
again.
Next
time
he
would
avoid
the
kingsroad.
He
could
follow
the
Wall
east,
perhaps
all
the
way
to
the
sea,
a
longer
route
but
a
safer
one.
Or
even
west,
to
the
mountains,
and
then
south
over
the
high
passes.
That
was
the
wildling’s
way,
hard
and
perilous,
but
at
least
no
one
wouid
follow
him.
He
wouldn’t
stray
within
a
hundred
leagues
of
Winterfell
or
the
kingsroad.

Samwell
Tarly
awaited
them
in
the
old
stables,
slumped
on
the
ground
against
a
bale
of
hay,
too
anxious
to
sleep.
He
rose
and
brushed
himself
off.
“I…
I’m
glad
they
found
you,
Jon.”

“I’m
not,”
Jon
said,
dismounting.

Pyp
hopped
off
his
horse
and
looked
at
the
lightening
sky
with
disgust.
“Give
us
a
hand
bedding
down
the
horses,
Sam,”
the
small
boy
said.
“We
have
a
long
day
before
us,
and
no
sleep
to
face
it
on,
thanks
to
Lord
Snow.”

When
day
broke,
Jon
walked
to
the
kitchens
as
he
did
every
dawn.
Three-Finger
Hobb
said
nothing
as
he
gave
him
the
Old
Bear’s
breakfast.
Today
it
was
three
brown
eggs
boiled
hard,
with
fried
bread
and
ham
steak
and
a
bowl
of
wrinkled
plums.
Jon
carried
the
food
back
to
the
King’s
Tower.
He
found
Mormont
at
the
window
seat,
writing.
His
raven
was
walking
back
and
forth
across
his
shoulders,
muttering,
“Corn,
corn,
corn.”
The
bird
shrieked
when
Jon
entered.
“Put
the
food
on
the
table,”
the
Old
Bear
said,
glancing
up.
“I’ll
have
some
beer.”

Jon
opened
a
shuttered
window,
took
the
flagon
of
beer
off
the
outside
ledge,
and
filled
a
horn.
Hobb
had
given
him
a
lemon,
still
cold
from
the
Wall.
Jon
crushed
it
in
his
fist.
The
juice
trickled
through
his
fingers.
Mormont
drank
lemon
in
his
beer
every
day,
and
claimed
that
was
why
he
still
had
his
own
teeth.

“Doubtless
you
loved
your
father,”
Mormont
said
when
Jon
brought
him
his
horn.
“The
things
we
love
destroy
us
every
time,
lad.
Remember
when
I
told
you
that?”

“I
remember,”
Jon
said
sullenly.
He
did
not
care
to
talk
of
his
father’s
death,
not
even
to
Mormont.

“See
that
you
never
forget
it.
The
hard
truths
are
the
ones
to
hold
tight.
Fetch
me
my
plate.
Is
it
ham
again?
So
be
it.
You
look
weary.
Was
your
moonlight
ride
so
tiring?”

Jon’s
throat
was
dry.
“You
know?”

“Know,”
the
raven
echoed
from
Mormont’s
shoulder.
“Know.”

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
“Do
you
think
they
chose
me
Lord
Commander
of
the
Night’s
Watch
because
I’m
dumb
as
a
stump,
Snow?
Aemon
told
me
you’d
go.
I
told
him
you’d
be
back.
I
know
my
men…
and
my
boys
too.
Honor
set
you
on
the
kingsroad…
and
honor
brought
you
back.”

“My
friends
brought
me
back,”
Jon
said.

“Did
I
say
it
was
your
honor?”
Mormont
inspected
his
plate.

“They
killed
my
father.
Did
you
expect
me
to
do
nothing?”

“If
truth
be
told,
we
expected
you
to
do
just
as
you
did.”
Mormont
tried
a
plum,
spit
out
the
pit.
“I
ordered
a
watch
kept
over
you.,
You
were
seen
leaving.
If
your
brothers
had
not
fetched
you
back,
you
would
have
been
taken
along
the
way,
and
not
by
friends.
Unless
you
have
a
horse
with
wings
like
a
raven.
Do
you?”

“No.”
Jon
felt
like
a
fool.

“Pity,
we
could
use
a
horse
like
that.”

Jon
stood
tall.
He
told
himself
that
he
would
die
well;
that
much
he
could
do,
at
the
least.
“I
know
the
penalty
for
desertion,
my
lord.
I’m
not
afraid
to
die.”

“Die!”
the
raven
cried.

“Nor
live,
I
hope,”
Mormont
said,
cutting
his
ham
with
a
dagger
and
feeding
a
bite
to
the
bird.
“You
have
not
deserted—yet.
Here
you
stand.
If
we
beheaded
every
boy
who
rode
to
Mole’s
Town
in
the
night,
only
ghosts
would
guard
the
Wall.
Yet
maybe
you
mean
to
flee
again
on
the
morrow,
or
a
fortnight
from
now.
Is
that
it?
Is
that
your
hope,
boy?”

Jon
kept
silent.

“I
thought
so.”
Mormont
peeled
the
shell
off
a
boiled
egg.
“Your
father
is
dead,
lad.
Do
you
think
you
can
bring
him
back?”

“No,”
he
answered,
sullen.

“Good,”
Mormont
said.
“We’ve
seen
the
dead
come
back,
you
and
me,
and
it’s
not
something
I
care
to
see
again.”
He
ate
the
egg
in
two
bites
and
flicked
a
bit
of
shell
out
from
between
his
teeth.
“Your
brother
is
in
the
field
with
all
the
power
of
the
north
behind
him.
Any
one
of
his
lords
bannermen
commands
more
swords
than
you’ll
find
in
all
the
Night’s
Watch.
Why
do
you
imagine
that
they
need
your
help?
Are
you
such
a
mighty
warrior,
or
do
you
carry
a
grumkin
in
your
pocket
to
magic
up
your
sword?”

Jon
had
no
answer
for
him.
The
raven
was
pecking
at
an
egg,
breaking
the
shell.
Pushing
his
beak
through
the
hole,
he
pulled
out
morsels
of
white
and
yoke.

The
Old
Bear
sighed.
“You
are
not
the
only
one
touched
by
this
war.
Like
as
not,
my
sister
is
marching
in
your
brother’s
host,
her
and
those
daughters
of
hers,
dressed
in
men’s
mail.
Maege
is
a
hoary
old
snark,
stubborn,
short-tempered,
and
willful.
Truth
be
told,
I
can
hardly
stand
to
be
around
the
wretched
woman,
but
that
does
not
mean
my
love
for
her
is
any
less
than
the
love
you
bear
your
half
sisters.”
Frowning,
Mormont
took
his
last
egg
and
squeezed
it
in
his
fist
until
the
shell
crunched.
“Or
perhaps
it
does.
Be
that
as
it
may,
I’d
still
grieve
if
she
were
slain,
yet
you
don’t
see
me
running
off.
I
said
the
words,
just
as
you
did.
My
place
is
here…
where
is
yours,
boy?”

I
have
no
place,
Jon
wanted
to
say,
I’m
a
bastard,
I
have
no
rights,
no
name,
no
mother,
and
now
not
even
a
father.
The
words
would
not
come.
“I
don’t
know.”

“I
do,”
said
Lord
Commander
Mormont.
“The
cold
winds
are
rising,
Snow.
Beyond
the
Wall,
the
shadows
lengthen.
Cotter
Pyke
writes
of
vast
herds
of
elk,
streaming
south
and
east
toward
the
sea,
and
mammoths
as
well.
He
says
one
of
his
men
discovered
huge,
misshapen
footprints
not
three
leagues
from
Eastwatch.
Rangers
from
the
Shadow
Tower
have
found
whole
villages
abandoned,
and
at
night
Ser
Denys
says
they
see
fires
in
the
mountains,
huge
blazes
that
burn
from
dusk
till
dawn.
Quorin
Halfhand
took
a
captive
in
the
depths
of
the
Gorge,
and
the
man
swears
that
Mance
Rayder
is
massing
all
his
people
in
some
new,
secret
stronghold
he’s
found,
to
what
end
the
gods
only
know.
Do
you
think
your
uncle
Benjen
was
the
only
ranger
we’ve
lost
this
past
year?”

“Ben
Jen,”
the
raven
squawked,
bobbing
its
head,
bits
of
egg
dribbling
from
its
beak.
“Ben
Jen.
Ben
Jen.”

“No,”
Jon
said.
There
had
been
others.
Too
many.

“Do
you
think
your
brother’s
war
is
more
important
than
ours?”
the
old
man
barked.

Jon
chewed
his
lip.
The
raven
flapped
its
wings
at
him.
“War,
war,
war,
war,”
it
sang.

“It’s
not,”
Mormont
told
him.
“Gods
save
us,
boy,
you’re
not
blind
and
you’re
not
stupid.
When
dead
men
come
hunting
in
the
night,
do
you
think
it
matters
who
sits
the
Iron
Throne?”

“No.”
Jon
had
not
thought
of
it
that
way.

“Your
lord
father
sent
you
to
us,
Jon.
Why,
who
can
say?”

“Why?
Why?
Why?”
the
raven
called.

“All
I
know
is
that
the
blood
of
the
First
Men
flows
in
the
veins
of
the
Starks.
The
First
Men
built
the
Wall,
and
it’s
said
they
remember
things
otherwise
forgotten.
And
that
beast
of
yours…
he
led
us
to
the
wights,
warned
you
of
the
dead
man
on
the
steps.
Ser
Jaremy
would
doubtless
call
that
happenstance,
yet
Ser
Jaremy
is
dead
and
I’m
not.”
Lord
Mormont
stabbed
a
chunk
of
ham
with
the
point
of
his
dagger.
“I
think
you
were
meant
to
be
here,
and
I
want
you
and
that
wolf
of
yours
with
us
when
we
go
beyond
the
Wall.”

His
words
sent
a
chill
of
excitement
down
Jon’s
back.
“Beyond
the
Wall?”

“You
heard
me.
I
mean
to
find
Ben
Stark,
alive
or
dead.”
He
chewed
and
swallowed.
“I
will
not
sit
here
meekly
and
wait
for
the
snows
and
the
ice
winds.
We
must
know
what
is
happening.
This
time
the
Night’s
Watch
will
ride
in
force,
against
the
King-beyond-the-Wall,
the
Others,
and
anything
else
that
may
be
out
there.
I
mean
to
command
them
myself.”
He
pointed
his
dagger
at
Jon’s
chest.
“By
custom,
the
Lord
Commander’s
steward
is
his
squire
as
well…
but
I
do
not
care
to
wake
every
dawn
wondering
if
you’ve
run
off
again.
So
I
will
have
an
answer
from
you,
Lord
Snow,
and
I
will
have
it
now.
Are
you
a
brother
of
the
Night’s
Watch…
or
only
a
bastard
boy
who
wants
to
play
at
war?”

Jon
Snow
straightened
himself
and
took
a
long
deep
breath.
Forgive
me,
Father.
Robb,
Arya,
Bran…
forgive
me,
I
cannot
help
you.
He
has
the
truth
of
it.
This
is
my
place.
“I
am…
yours,
my
lord.
Your
man.
I
swear
it.
I
will
not
run
again.”

The
Old
Bear
snorted.
“Good.
Now
go
put
on
your
sword.”





CATELYN

It
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
that
Catelyn
Stark
had
carried
her
infant
son
out
of
Riverrun,
crossing
the
Tumblestone
in
a
small
boat
to
begin
their
journey
north
to
Winterfell.
And
it
was
across
the
Tumblestone
that
they
came
home
now,
though
the
boy
wore
plate
and
mail
in
place
of
swaddling
clothes.

Robb
sat
in
the
bow
with
Grey
Wind,
his
hand
resting
on
his
direwolf
s
head
as
the
rowers
pulled
at
their
oars.
Theon
Greyjoy
was
with
him.
Her
uncle
Brynden
would
come
behind
in
the
second
boat,
with
the
Greatjon
and
Lord
Karstark.

Catelyn
took
a
place
toward
the
stern.
They
shot
down
the
Tumblestone,
letting
the
strong
current
push
them
past
the
looming
Wheel
Tower.
The
splash
and
rumble
of
the
great
waterwheel
within
was
a
sound
from
her
girlhood
that
brought
a
sad
smile
to
Catelyn’s
face.
From
the
sandstone
walls
of
the
castle,
soldiers
and
servants
shouted
down
her
name,
and
Robb’s,
and
“Winterfell!”
From
every
rampart
waved
the
banner
of
House
Tully:
a
leaping
trout,
silver,
against
a
rippling
blue-and-red
field.
It
was
a
stirring
sight,
yet
it
did
not
lift
her
heart.
She
wondered
if
indeed
her
heart
would
ever
lift
again.
Oh,
Ned…

Below
the
Wheel
Tower,
they
made
a
wide
turn
and
knifed
through
the
churning
water.
The
men
put
their
backs
into
it.
The
wide
arch
of
the
Water
Gate
came
into
view,
and
she
heard
the
creak
of
heavy
chains
as
the
great
iron
portcullis
was
winched
upward.
It
rose
slowly
as
they
approached,
and
Catelyn
saw
that
the
lower
half
of
it
was
red
with
rust.
The
bottom
foot
dripped
brown
mud
on
them
as
they
passed
underneath,
the
barbed
spikes
mere
inches
above
their
heads.
Catelyn
gazed
up
at
the
bars
and
wondered
how
deep
the
rust
went
and
how
well
the
portcullis
would
stand
up
to
a
ram
and
whether
it
ought
to
be
replaced.
Thoughts
like
that
were
seldom
far
from
her
mind
these
days.

They
passed
beneath
the
arch
and
under
the
walls,
moving
from
sunlight
to
shadow
and
back
into
sunlight.
Boats
large
and
small
were
tied
up
all
around
them,
secured
to
iron
rings
set
in
the
stone.
Her
father’s
guards
waited
on
the
water
stair
with
her
brother.
Ser
Edmure
Tully
was
a
stocky
young
man
with
a
shaggy
head
of
auburn
hair
and
a
fiery
beard.
His
breastplate
was
scratched
and
dented
from
battle,
his
blue-and-red
cloak
stained
by
blood
and
smoke.
At
his
side
stood
the
Lord
Tytos
Blackwood,
a
hard
pike
of
a
man
with
close-cropped
salt-and-pepper
whiskers
and
a
hook
nose.
His
bright
yellow
armor
was
inlaid
with
jet
in
elaborate
vine-and-leaf
patterns,
and
a
cloak
sewn
from
raven
feathers
draped
his
thin
shoulders.
It
had
been
Lord
Tytos
who
led
the
sortie
that
plucked
her
brother
from
the
Lannister
camp.

“Bring
them
in,”
Ser
Edmure
commanded.
Three
men
scrambled
down
the
stairs
knee-deep
in
the
water
and
pulled
the
boat
close
with
long
hooks.
When
Grey
Wind
bounded
out,
one
of
them
dropped
his
pole
and
lurched
back,
stumbling
and
sitting
down
abruptly
in
the
river.
The
others
laughed,
and
the
man
got
a
sheepish
look
on
his
face.
Theon
Greyjoy
vaulted
over
the
side
of
the
boat
and
lifted
Catelyn
by
the
waist,
setting
her
on
a
dry
step
above
him
as
water
lapped
around
his
boots.

Edmure
came
down
the
steps
to
embrace
her.
“Sweet
sister,”
he
murmured
hoarsely.
He
had
deep
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
made
for
smiles,
but
he
was
not
smiling
now.
He
looked
worn
and
tired,
battered
by
battle
and
haggard
from
strain.
His
neck
was
bandaged
where
he
had
taken
a
wound.
Catelyn
hugged
him
fiercely.

“Your
grief
is
mine,
Cat,”
he
said
when
they
broke
apart.
“When
we
heard
about
Lord
Eddard…
the
Lannisters
will
pay,
I
swear
it,
you
will
have
your
vengeance.”

“Will
that
bring
Ned
back
to
me?”
she
said
sharply.
The
wound
was
still
too
fresh
for
softer
words.
She
could
not
think
about
Ned
now.
She
would
not.
It
would
not
do.
She
had
to
be
strong.
“All
that
will
keep.
I
must
see
Father.”

“He
awaits
you
in
his
solar,”
Edmure
said.

“Lord
Hoster
is
bedridden,
my
lady,”
her
father’s
steward
explained.
When
had
that
good
man
grown
so
old
and
grey?
“He
instructed
me
to
bring
you
to
him
at
once.”

“I’ll
take
her.”
Edmure
escorted
her
up
the
water
stair
and
across
the
lower
bailey,
where
Petyr
Baelish
and
Brandon
Stark
had
once
crossed
swords
for
her
favor.
The
massive
sandstone
walls
of
the
keep
loomed
above
them.
As
they
pushed
through
a
door
between
two
guardsmen
in
fish-crest
helms,
she
asked,
“How
bad
is
he?”
dreading
the
answer
even
as
she
said
the
words.

Edmure’s
look
was
somber.
“He
will
not
be
with
us
long,
the
maesters
say.
The
pain
is…
constant,
and
grievous.”

A
blind
rage
filled
her,
a
rage
at
all
the
world;
at
her
brother
Edmure
and
her
sister
Lysa,
at
the
Lannisters,
at
the
maesters,
at
Ned
and
her
father
and
the
monstrous
gods
who
would
take
them
both
away
from
her.
“You
should
have
told
me,”
she
said.
“You
should
have
sent
word
as
soon
as
you
knew.”

“He
forbade
it.
He
did
not
want
his
enemies
to
know
that
he
was
dying.
With
the
realm
so
troubled,
he
feared
that
if
the
Lannisters
suspected
how
frail
he
was…”

“…they
might
attack?”
Catelyn
finished,
hard.
It
was
your
doing,
yours,
a
voice
whispered
inside
her.
If
you
had
not
taken
it
upon
yourself
to
seize
the
dwarf…

They
climbed
the
spiral
stair
in
silence.

The
keep
was
three-sided,
like
Riverrun
itself,
and
Lord
Hoster’s
solar
was
triangular
as
well,
with
a
stone
balcony
that
jutted
out
to
the
east
like
the
prow
of
some
great
sandstone
ship.
From
there
the
lord
of
the
castle
could
look
down
on
his
walls
and
battlements,
and
beyond,
to
where
the
waters
met.
They
had
moved
her
father’s
bed
out
onto
the
balcony.
“He
likes
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
watch
the
rivers,”
Edmure
explained.
“Father,
see
who
I’ve
brought.
Cat
has
come
to
see
you…”

Hoster
Tully
had
always
been
a
big
man;
tall
and
broad
in
his
youth,
portly
as
he
grew
older.
Now
he
seemed
shrunken,
the
muscle
and
meat
melted
off
his
bones.
Even
his
face
sagged.
The
last
time
Catelyn
had
seen
him,
his
hair
and
beard
had
been
brown,
well
streaked
with
grey.
Now
they
had
gone
white
as
snow.

His
eyes
opened
to
the
sound
of
Edmure’s
voice.
“Little
cat,”
he
murmured
in
a
voice
thin
and
wispy
and
wracked
by
pain.
“My
little
cat.”
A
tremulous
smile
touched
his
face
as
his
hand
groped
for
hers.
“I
watched
for
you…”

“I
shall
leave
you
to
talk,”
her
brother
said,
kissing
their
lord
father
gently
on
the
brow
before
he
withdrew.

Catelyn
knelt
and
took
her
father’s
hand
in
hers.
It
was
a
big
hand,
but
fleshless
now,
the
bones
moving
loosely
under
the
skin,
all
the
strength
gone
from
it.
“You
should
have
told
me,”
she
said.
“A
rider,
a
raven…”

“Riders
are
taken,
questioned,”
he
answered.
“Ravens
are
brought
down…”
A
spasm
of
pain
took
him,
and
his
fingers
clutched
hers
hard.
“The
crabs
are
in
my
belly…
pinching,
always
pinching.
Day
and
night.
They
have
fierce
claws,
the
crabs.
Maester
Vyman
makes
me
dreamwine,
milk
of
the
poppy…
I
sleep
a
lot…
but
I
wanted
to
be
awake
to
see
you,
when
you
came.
I
was
afraid…
when
the
Lannisters
took
your
brother,
the
camps
all
around
us…
was
afraid
I
would
go,
before
I
could
see
you
again…
I
was
afraid…”

“I’m
here,
Father,”
she
said.
“With
Robb,
my
son.
He’ll
want
to
see
you
too.”

“Your
boy,”
he
whispered.
“He
had
my
eyes,
I
remember…”

“He
did,
and
does.
And
we’ve
brought
you
Jaime
Lannister,
in
irons.
Riverrun
is
free
again,
Father.”

Lord
Hoster
smiled.
“I
saw.
Last
night,
when
it
began,
I
told
them…
had
to
see.
They
carried
me
to
the
gatehouse…
watched
from
the
battlements.
Ah,
that
was
beautiful…
the
torches
came
in
a
wave,
I
could
hear
the
cries
floating
across
the
river…
sweet
cries…
when
that
siege
tower
went
up,
gods…
would
have
died
then,
and
glad,
if
only
I
could
have
seen
you
children
first.
Was
it
your
boy
who
did
it?
Was
it
your
Robb?”

“Yes,”
Catelyn
said,
fiercely
proud.
“It
was
Robb…
and
Brynden.
Your
brother
is
here
as
well,
my
lord.”

“Him.”
Her
father’s
voice
was
a
faint
whisper.
“The
Blackfish…
came
back?
From
the
Vale?”

“Yes.”

“And
Lysa?”
A
cool
wind
moved
through
his
thin
white
hair.
“Gods
be
good,
your
sister…
did
she
come
as
well?”

He
sounded
so
full
of
hope
and
yearning
that
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
truth.
“No.
I’m
sorry…”

“Oh.”
His
face
fell,
and
some
light
went
out
of
his
eyes.
“I’d
hoped
I
would
have
liked
to
see
her,
before…”

“She’s
with
her
son,
in
the
Eyrie.”

Lord
Hoster
gave
a
weary
nod.
“Lord
Robert
now,
poor
Arryn’s
gone…
I
remember…
why
did
she
not
come
with
you?”

“She
is
frightened,
my
lord.
In
the
Eyrie
she
feels
safe.”
She
kissed
his
wrinkled
brow.
“Robb
will
be
waiting.
Will
you
see
him?
And
Brynden?”

“Your
son,”
he
whispered.
“Yes.
Cat’s
child…
he
had
my
eyes,
I
remember.
When
he
was
born.
Bring
him…
yes.”

“And
your
brother?”

Her
father
glanced
out
over
the
rivers.
“Blackfish,”
he
said.
“Has
he
wed
yet?
Taken
some…
girl
to
wife?”

Even
on
his
deathbed,
Catelyn
thought
sadly.
“He
has
not
wed.
You
know
that,
Father.
Nor
will
he
ever.”

“I
told
him…
commanded
him.
Marry!
I
was
his
lord.
He
knows.
My
right,
to
make
his
match.
A
good
match.
A
Redwyne.
Old
House.
Sweet
girl,
pretty…
freckles…
Bethany,
yes.
Poor
child.
Still
waiting.
Yes.
Still…”

“Bethany
Redwyne
wed
Lord
Rowan
years
ago,”
Catelyn
reminded
him.
“She
has
three
children
by
him.”

“Even
so,”
Lord
Hoster
muttered.
“Even
so.
Spit
on
the
girl.
The
Redwynes.
Spit
on
me.
His
lord,
his
brother…
that
Blackfish.
I
had
other
offers.
Lord
Bracken’s
girl.
Walder
Frey…
any
of
three,
he
said…
Has
he
wed?
Anyone?
Anyone?”

“No
one,”
Catelyn
said,
“yet
he
has
come
many
leagues
to
see
you,
fighting
his
way
back
to
Riverrun.
I
would
not
be
here
now,
if
Ser
Brynden
had
not
helped
us.”

“He
was
ever
a
warrior,”
her
father
husked.
“That
he
could
do.
Knight
of
the
Gate,
yes.”
He
leaned
back
and
closed
his
eyes,
inutterably
weary.
“Send
him.
Later.
I’ll
sleep
now.
Too
sick
to
fight.
Send
him
up
later,
the
Blackfish…”

Catelyn
kissed
him
gently,
smoothed
his
hair,
and
left
him
there
in
the
shade
of
his
keep,
with
his
rivers
flowing
beneath.
He
was
asleep
before
she
left
the
solar.

When
she
returned
to
the
lower
bailey,
Ser
Brynden
Tully
stood
on
the
water
stairs
with
wet
boots,
talking
with
the
captain
of
Riverrun’s
guards.
He
came
to
her
at
once.
“Is
he—”

“Dying,”
she
said.
“As
we
feared.”

Her
uncle’s
craggy
face
showed
his
pain
plain.
He
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
grey
hair.
“Will
he
see
me?”

She
nodded.
“He
says
he
is
too
sick
to
fight.”

Brynden
Blackfish
chuckled.
“I
am
too
old
a
soldier
to
believe
that.
Hoster
will
be
chiding
me
about
the
Redwyne
girl
even
as
we
light
his
funeral
pyre,
damn
his
bones.”

Catelyn
smiled,
knowing
it
was
true.
“I
do
not
see
Robb.”

“He
went
with
Greyjoy
to
the
hall,
I
believe.”

Theon
Greyjoy
was
seated
on
a
bench
in
Riverrun’s
Great
Hall,
enjoying
a
horn
of
ale
and
regaling
her
father’s
garrison
with
an
account
of
the
slaughter
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
“Some
tried
to
flee,
but
we’d
pinched
the
valley
shut
at
both
ends,
and
we
rode
out
of
the
darkness
with
sword
and
lance.
The
Lannisters
must
have
thought
the
Others
themselves
were
on
them
when
that
wolf
of
Robb’s
got
in
among
them.
I
saw
him
tear
one
man’s
arm
from
his
shoulder,
and
their
horses
went
mad
at
the
scent
of
him.
I
couldn’t
tell
you
how
many
men
were
thrown—”

“Theon,”
she
interrupted,
“where
might
I
find
my
son?”

“Lord
Robb
went
to
visit
the
godswood,
my
lady.”

It
was
what
Ned
would
have
done.
He
is
his
father’s
son
as
much
as
mine,
I
must
remember.
Oh,
gods,
Ned…

She
found
Robb
beneath
the
green
canopy
of
leaves,
surrounded
by
tall
redwoods
and
great
old
elms,
kneeling
before
the
heart
tree,
a
slender
weirwood
with
a
face
more
sad
than
fierce.
His
longsword
was
before
him,
the
point
thrust
in
the
earth,
his
gloved
hands
clasped
around
the
hilt.
Around
him
others
knelt:
Greatjon
Umber,
Rickard
Karstark,
Maege
Mormont,
Galbart
Glover,
and
more.
Even
Tytos
Blackwood
was
among
them,
the
great
raven
cloak
fanned
out
behind
him.
These
are
the
ones
who
keep
the
old
gods,
she
realized.
She
asked
herself
what
gods
she
kept
these
days,
and
could
not
find
an
answer.

It
would
not
do
to
disturb
them
at
their
prayers.
The
gods
must
have
their
due…
even
cruel
gods
who
would
take
Ned
from
her,
and
her
lord
father
as
well.
So
Catelyn
waited.
The
river
wind
moved
through
the
high
branches,
and
she
could
see
the
Wheel
Tower
to
her
right,
ivy
crawling
up
its
side.
As
she
stood
there,
all
the
memories
came
flooding
back
to
her.
Her
father
had
taught
her
to
ride
amongst
these
trees,
and
that
was
the
elm
that
Edmure
had
fallen
from
when
he
broke
his
arm,
and
over
there,
beneath
that
bower,
she
and
Lysa
had
played
at
kissing
with
Petyr.

She
had
not
thought
of
that
in
years.
How
young
they
all
had
been—she
no
older
than
Sansa,
Lysa
younger
than
Arya,
and
Petyr
younger
still,
yet
eager.
The
girls
had
traded
him
between
them,
serious
and
giggling
by
turns.
It
came
back
to
her
so
vividly
she
could
almost
feel
his
sweaty
fingers
on
her
shoulders
and
taste
the
mint
on
his
breath.
There
was
always
mint
growing
in
the
godswood,
and
Petyr
had
liked
to
chew
it.
He
had
been
such
a
bold
little
boy,
always
in
trouble.
“He
tried
to
put
his
tongue
in
my
mouth,”
Catelyn
had
confessed
to
her
sister
afterward,
when
they
were
alone.
“He
did
with
me
too,”
Lysa
had
whispered,
shy
and
breathless.
“I
liked
it.”

Robb
got
to
his
feet
slowly
and
sheathed
his
sword,
and
Catelyn
found
herself
wondering
whether
her
son
had
ever
kissed
a
girl
in
the
godswood.
Surely
he
must
have.
She
had
seen
Jeyne
Poole
giving
him
moist-eyed
glances,
and
some
of
the
serving
girls,
even
ones
as
old
as
eighteen…
he
had
ridden
in
battle
and
killed
men
with
a
sword,
surely
he
had
been
kissed.
There
were
tears
in
her
eyes.
She
wiped
them
away
angrily.

“Mother,”
Robb
said
when
he
saw
her
standing
there.
“We
must
call
a
council.
There
are
things
to
be
decided.”

“Your
grandfather
would
like
to
see
you,”
she
said.
“Robb,
he’s
very
sick.”

“Ser
Edmure
told
me.
I
am
sorry,
Mother…
for
Lord
Hoster
and
for
you.
Yet
first
we
must
meet.
We’ve
had
word
from
the
south.
Renly
Baratheon
has
claimed
his
brother’s
crown.”

“Renly?”
she
said,
shocked.
“I
had
thought,
surely
it
would
be
Lord
Stannis…”

“So
did
we
all,
my
lady,”
Galbart
Glover
said.

The
war
council
convened
in
the
Great
Hall,
at
four
long
trestle
tables
arranged
in
a
broken
square.
Lord
Hoster
was
too
weak
to
attend,
asleep
on
his
balcony,
dreaming
of
the
sun
on
the
rivers
of
his
youth.
Edmure
sat
in
the
high
seat
of
the
Tullys,
with
Brynden
Blackfish
at
his
side,
and
his
father’s
bannermen
arrayed
to
right
and
left
and
along
the
side
tables.
Word
of
the
victory
at
Riverrun
had
spread
to
the
fugitive
lords
of
the
Trident,
drawing
them
back.
Karyl
Vance
came
in,
a
lord
now,
his
father
dead
beneath
the
Golden
Tooth.
Ser
Marq
Piper
was
with
him,
and
they
brought
a
Darry,
Ser
Raymun’s
son,
a
lad
no
older
than
Bran.
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
arrived
from
the
ruins
of
Stone
Hedge,
glowering
and
blustering,
and
took
a
seat
as
far
from
Tytos
Blackwood
as
the
tables
would
permit.

The
northern
lords
sat
opposite,
with
Catelyn
and
Robb
facing
her
brother
across
the
tables.
They
were
fewer.
The
Greatjon
sat
at
Robb’s
left
hand,
and
then
Theon
Greyjoy;
Galbart
Glover
and
Lady
Mormont
were
to
the
right
of
Catelyn.
Lord
Rickard
Karstark,
gaunt
and
hollow-eyed
in
his
grief,
took
his
seat
like
a
man
in
a
nightmare,
his
long
beard
uncombed
and
unwashed.
He
had
left
two
sons
dead
in
the
Whispering
Wood,
and
there
was
no
word
of
the
third,
his
eldest,
who
had
led
the
Karstark
spears
against
Tywin
Lannister
on
the
Green
Fork.

The
arguing
raged
on
late
into
the
night.
Each
lord
had
a
right
to
speak,
and
speak
they
did…
and
shout,
and
curse,
and
reason,
and
cajole,
and
jest,
and
bargain,
and
slam
tankards
on
the
table,
and
threaten,
and
walk
out,
and
return
sullen
or
smiling.
Catelyn
sat
and
listened
to
it
all.

Roose
Bolton
had
re-formed
the
battered
remnants
of
their
other
host
at
the
mouth
of
the
causeway.
Ser
Helman
Tallhart
and
Walder
Frey
still
held
the
Twins.
Lord
Tywin’s
army
had
crossed
the
Trident,
and
was
making
for
Harrenhal.
And
there
were
two
kings
in
the
realm.
Two
kings,
and
no
agreement.

Many
of
the
lords
bannermen
wanted
to
march
on
Harrenhal
at
once,
to
meet
Lord
Tywin
and
end
Lannister
power
for
all
time.
Young,
hot-tempered
Marq
Piper
urged
a
strike
west
at
Casterly
Rock
instead.
Still
others
counseled
patience.
Riverrun
sat
athwart
the
Lannister
supply
lines,
Jason
Mallister
pointed
out;
let
them
bide
their
time,
denying
Lord
Tywin
fresh
levies
and
provisions
while
they
strengthened
their
defenses
and
rested
their
weary
troops.
Lord
Blackwood
would
have
none
of
it.
They
should
finish
the
work
they
began
in
the
Whispering
Wood.
March
to
Harrenhal
and
bring
Roose
Bolton’s
army
down
as
well.
What
Blackwood
urged,
Bracken
opposed,
as
ever;
Lord
Jonos
Bracken
rose
to
insist
they
ought
pledge
their
fealty
to
King
Renly,
and
move
south
to
join
their
might
to
his.

“Renly
is
not
the
king,”
Robb
said.
It
was
the
first
time
her
son
had
spoken.
Like
his
father,
he
knew
how
to
listen.

“You
cannot
mean
to
hold
to
Joffrey,
my
lord,”
Galbart
Glover
said.
“He
put
your
father
to
death.”

“That
makes
him
evil,”
Robb
replied.
“I
do
not
know
that
it
makes
Renly
king.
Joffrey
is
still
Robert’s
eldest
trueborn
son,
so
the
throne
is
rightfully
his
by
all
the
laws
of
the
realm.
Were
he
to
die,
and
I
mean
to
see
that
he
does,
he
has
a
younger
brother.
Tommen
is
next
in
line
after
Joffrey.”

“Tommen
is
no
less
a
Lannister,”
Ser
Marq
Piper
snapped.

“As
you
say,”
said
Robb,
troubled.
“Yet
if
neither
one
is
king,
still,
how
could
it
be
Lord
Renly?
He’s
Robert’s
younger
brother.
Bran
can’t
be
Lord
of
Winterfell
before
me,
and
Renly
can’t
be
king
before
Lord
Stannis.”

Lady
Mormont
agreed.
“Lord
Stannis
has
the
better
claim.”

“Renly
is
crowned,”
said
Marq
Piper.
“Highgarden
and
Storm’s
End
support
his
claim,
and
the
Dornishmen
will
not
be
laggardly.
If
Winterfell
and
Riverrun
add
their
strength
to
his,
he
will
have
five
of
the
seven
great
houses
behind
him.
Six,
if
the
Arryns
bestir
themselves!
Six
against
the
Rock!
My
lords,
within
the
year,
we
will
have
all
their
heads
on
pikes,
the
queen
and
the
boy
king,
Lord
Tywin,
the
Imp,
the
Kingslayer,
Ser
Kevan,
all
of
them!
That
is
what
we
shall
win
if
we
join
with
King
Renly.
What
does
Lord
Stannis
have
against
that,
that
we
should
cast
it
all
aside?”

“The
right,”
said
Robb
stubbornly.
Catelyn
thought
he
sounded
eerily
like
his
father
as
he
said
it.

“So
you
mean
us
to
declare
for
Stannis?”
asked
Edmure.

“I
don’t
know,”
said
Robb.
“I
prayed
to
know
what
to
do,
but
the
gods
did
not
answer.
The
Lannisters
killed
my
father
for
a
traitor,
and
we
know
that
was
a
lie,
but
if
Joffrey
is
the
lawful
king
and
we
fight
against
him,
we
will
be
traitors.”

“My
lord
father
would
urge
caution,”
aged
Ser
Stevron
said,
with
the
weaselly
smile
of
a
Frey.
“Wait,
let
these
two
kings
play
their
game
of
thrones.
When
they
are
done
fighting,
we
can
bend
our
knees
to
the
victor,
or
oppose
him,
as
we
choose.
With
Renly
arming,
likely
Lord
Tywin
would
welcome
a
truce…
and
the
safe
return
of
his
son.
Noble
lords,
allow
me
to
go
to
him
at
Harrenhal
and
arrange
good
terms
and
ransoms…”

A
roar
of
outrage
drowned
out
his
voice.
“Craven!”
the
Greatjon
thundered.
“Begging
for
a
truce
will
make
us
seem
weak,”
declared
Lady
Mormont.
“Ransoms
be
damned,
we
must
not
give
up
the
Kingslayer,”
shouted
Rickard
Karstark.

“Why
not
a
peace?”
Catelyn
asked.

The
lords
looked
at
her,
but
it
was
Robb’s
eyes
she
felt,
his
and
his
alone.
“My
lady,
they
murdered
my
lord
father,
your
husband,”
he
said
grimly.
He
unsheathed
his
longsword
and
laid
it
on
the
table
before
him,
the
bright
steel
on
the
rough
wood.
“This
is
the
only
peace
I
have
for
Lannisters.”

The
Greatjon
bellowed
his
approval,
and
other
men
added
their
voices,
shouting
and
drawing
swords
and
pounding
their
fists
on
the
table.
Catelyn
waited
until
they
had
quieted.
“My
lords,”
she
said
then,
“Lord
Eddard
was
your
liege,
but
I
shared
his
bed
and
bore
his
children.
Do
you
think
I
love
him
any
less
than
you?”
Her
voice
almost
broke
with
her
grief,
but
Catelyn
took
a
long
breath
and
steadied
herself.
“Robb,
if
that
sword
could
bring
him
back,
I
should
never
let
you
sheathe
it
until
Ned
stood
at
my
side
once
more…
but
he
is
gone,
and
hundred
Whispering
Woods
will
not
change
that.
Ned
is
gone,
and
Daryn
Hornwood,
and
Lord
Karstark’s
valiant
sons,
and
many
other
good
men
besides,
and
none
of
them
will
return
to
us.
Must
we
have
more
deaths
still?”

“You
are
a
woman,
my
lady,”
the
Greatjon
rumbled
in
his
deep
voice.
“Women
do
not
understand
these
things.”

“You
are
the
gentle
sex,”
said
Lord
Karstark,
with
the
lines
of
grief
fresh
on
his
face.
“A
man
has
a
need
for
vengeance.”

“Give
me
Cersei
Lannister,
Lord
Karstark,
and
you
would
see
how
gentle
a
woman
can
be,”
Catelyn
replied.
“Perhaps
I
do
not
understand
tactics
and
strategy…
but
I
understand
futility.
We
went
to
war
when
Lannister
armies
were
ravaging
the
riverlands,
and
Ned
was
a
prisoner,
falsely
accused
of
treason.
We
fought
to
defend
ourselves,
and
to
win
my
lord’s
freedom.

“Well,
the
one
is
done,
and
the
other
forever
beyond
our
reach.
I
will
mourn
for
Ned
until
the
end
of
my
days,
but
I
must
think
of
the
living.
I
want
my
daughters
back,
and
the
queen
holds
them
still.
If
I
must
trade
our
four
Lannisters
for
their
two
Starks,
I
will
call
that
a
bargain
and
thank
the
gods.
I
want
you
safe,
Robb,
ruling
at
Winterfell
from
your
father’s
seat.
I
want
you
to
live
your
life,
to
kiss
a
girl
and
wed
a
woman
and
father
a
son.
I
want
to
write
an
end
to
this.
I
want
to
go
home,
my
lords,
and
weep
for
my
husband.”

The
hall
was
very
quiet
when
Catelyn
finished
speaking.

“Peace,”
said
her
uncle
Brynden.
“Peace
is
sweet,
my
lady…
but
on
what
terms?
It
is
no
good
hammering
your
sword
into
a
plowshare
if
you
must
forge
it
again
on
the
morrow.”

“What
did
Torrhen
and
my
Eddard
die
for,
if
I
am
to
return
to
Karhold
with
nothing
but
their
bones?”
asked
Rickard
Karstark.

“Aye,”
said
Lord
Bracken.
“Gregor
Clegane
laid
waste
to
my
fields,
slaughtered
my
smallfolk,
and
left
Stone
Hedge
a
smoking
ruin.
Am
I
now
to
bend
the
knee
to
the
ones
who
sent
him?
What
have
we
fought
for,
if
we
are
to
put
all
back
as
it
was
before?”

Lord
Blackwood
agreed,
to
Catelyn’s
surprise
and
dismay.
“And
if
we
do
make
peace
with
King
Joffrey,
are
we
not
then
traitors
to
King
Renly?
What
if
the
stag
should
prevail
against
the
lion,
where
would
that
leave
us?”

“Whatever
you
may
decide
for
yourselves,
I
shall
never
call
a
Lannister
my
king,”
declared
Marq
Piper.

“Nor
I!”
yelled
the
little
Darry
boy.
“I
never
will!”

Again
the
shouting
began.
Catelyn
sat
despairing.
She
had
come
so
close,
she
thought.
They
had
almost
listened,
almost…
but
the
moment
was
gone.
There
would
be
no
peace,
no
chance
to
heal,
no
safety.
She
looked
at
her
son,
watched
him
as
he
listened
to
the
lords
debate,
frowning,
troubled,
yet
wedded
to
his
war.
He
had
pledged
himself
to
marry
a
daughter
of
Walder
Frey,
but
she
saw
his
true
bride
plain
before
her
now:
the
sword
he
had
laid
on
the
table.

Catelyn
was
thinking
of
her
girls,
wondering
if
she
would
ever
see
them
again,
when
the
Greatjon
lurched
to
his
feet.

“MY
LORDS!”
he
shouted,
his
voice
booming
off
the
rafters.
“Here
is
what
I
say
to
these
two
kings!”
He
spat.
“Renly
Baratheon
is
nothing
to
me,
nor
Stannis
neither.
Why
should
they
rule
over
me
and
mine,
from
some
flowery
seat
in
Highgarden
or
Dorne?
What
do
they
know
of
the
Wall
or
the
wolfswood
or
the
barrows
of
the
First
Men?
Even
their
gods
are
wrong.
The
Others
take
the
Lannisters
too,
I’ve
had
a
bellyful
of
them.”
He
reached
back
over
his
shoulder
and
drew
his
immense
two-handed
greatsword.
“Why
shouldn’t
we
rule
ourselves
again?
It
was
the
dragons
we
married,
and
the
dragons
are
all
dead!”
He
pointed
at
Robb
with
the
blade.
“There
sits
the
only
king
I
mean
to
bow
my
knee
to,
m’lords,”
he
thundered.
“The
King
in
the
North!”

And
he
knelt,
and
laid
his
sword
at
her
son’s
feet.

“I’ll
have
peace
on
those
terms,”
Lord
Karstark
said.
“They
can
keep
their
red
castle
and
their
iron
chair
as
well.”
He
eased
his
longsword
from
its
scabbard.
“The
King
in
the
North!”
he
said,
kneeling
beside
the
Greatjon.

Maege
Mormont
stood.
“The
King
of
Winter!”
she
declared,
and
laid
her
spiked
mace
beside
the
swords.
And
the
river
lords
were
rising
too,
Blackwood
and
Bracken
and
Mallister,
houses
who
had
never
been
ruled
from
Winterfell,
yet
Catelyn
watched
them
rise
and
draw
their
blades,
bending
their
knees
and
shouting
the
old
words
that
had
not
been
heard
in
the
realm
for
more
than
three
hundred
years,
since
Aegon
the
Dragon
had
come
to
make
the
Seven
Kingdoms
one…
yet
now
were
heard
again,
ringing
from
the
timbers
of
her
father’s
hall:

“The
King
in
the
North!”

“The
King
in
the
North!”

“THE
KING
IN
THE
NORTH!”





DAENERYS

The
land
was
red
and
dead
and
parched,
and
good
wood
was
hard
to
come
by.
Her
foragers
returned
with
gnarled
cottonwoods,
purple
brush,
sheaves
of
brown
grass.
They
took
the
two
straightest
trees,
hacked
the
limbs
and
branches
from
them,
skinned
off
their
bark,
and
split
them,
laying
the
logs
in
a
square.
Its
center
they
filled
with
straw,
brush,
bark
shavings,
and
bundles
of
dry
grass.
Rakharo
chose
a
stallion
from
the
small
herd
that
remained
to
them;
he
was
not
the
equal
of
Khal
Drogo’s
red,
but
few
horses
were.
In
the
center
of
the
square,
Aggo
fed
him
a
withered
apple
and
dropped
him
in
an
instant
with
an
axe
blow
between
the
eyes.

Bound
hand
and
foot,
Mirri
Maz
Duur
watched
from
the
dust
with
disquiet
in
her
black
eyes.
“It
is
not
enough
to
kill
a
horse,”
she
told
Dany.
“By
itself,
the
blood
is
nothing.
You
do
not
have
the
words
to
make
a
spell,
nor
the
wisdom
to
find
them.
Do
you
think
bloodmagic
is
a
game
for
children?
You
call
me
maegi
as
if
it
were
a
curse,
but
all
it
means
is
wise.
You
are
a
child,
with
a
child’s
ignorance.
Whatever
you
mean
to
do,
it
will
not
work.
Loose
me
from
these
bonds
and
I
will
help
you.”

“I
am
tired
of
the
maegi’s
braying,”
Dany
told
Jhogo.
He
took
his
whip
to
her,
and
after
that
the
godswife
kept
silent.

Over
the
carcass
of
the
horse,
they
built
a
platform
of
hewn
logs;
trunks
of
smaller
trees
and
limbs
from
the
greater,
and
the
thickest
straightest
branches
they
could
find.
They
laid
the
wood
east
to
west,
from
sunrise
to
sunset.
On
the
platform
they
piled
Khal
Drogo’s
treasures:
his
great
tent,
his
painted
vests,
his
saddles
and
harness,
the
whip
his
father
had
given
him
when
he
came
to
manhood,
the
arakh
he
had
used
to
slay
Khal
Ogo
and
his
son,
a
mighty
dragonbone
bow.
Aggo
would
have
added
the
weapons
Drogo’s
bloodriders
had
given
Dany
for
bride
gifts
as
well,
but
she
forbade
it.
“Those
are
mine,”
she
told
him,
“and
I
mean
to
keep
them.”
Another
layer
of
brush
was
piled
about
the
khal’s
treasures,
and
bundles
of
dried
grass
scattered
over
them.

Ser
Jorah
Mormont
drew
her
aside
as
the
sun
was
creeping
toward
its
zenith.
“Princess…”
he
began.

“Why
do
you
call
me
that?”
Dany
challenged
him.
“My
brother
Viserys
was
your
king,
was
he
not?”

“He
was,
my
lady.”

“Viserys
is
dead.
I
am
his
heir,
the
last
blood
of
House
Targaryen.
Whatever
was
his
is
mine
now.”

“My…
queen,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
going
to
one
knee.
“My
sword
that
was
his
is
yours,
Dacnerys.
And
my
heart
as
well,
that
never
belonged
to
your
brother.
I
am
only
a
knight,
and
I
have
nothing
to
offer
you
but
exile,
but
I
beg
you,
hear
me.
Let
Khal
Drogo
go.
You
shall
not
be
alone.
I
promise
you,
no
man
shall
take
you
to
Vaes
Dothrak
unless
you
wish
to
go.
You
need
not
join
the
dosh
khaleen.
Come
east
with
me.
Yi
Ti,
Qarth,
the
Jade
Sea,
Asshai
by
the
Shadow.
We
will
see
all
the
wonders
yet
unseen,
and
drink
what
wines
the
gods
see
fit
to
serve
us.
Please,
Khaleesi.
I
know
what
you
intend.
Do
not.
Do
not.”

“I
must,”
Dany
told
him.
She
touched
his
face,
fondly,
sadly.
“You
do
not
understand.”

“I
understand
that
you
loved
him,”
Ser
Jorah
said
in
a
voice
thick
with
despair.
“I
loved
my
lady
wife
once,
yet
I
did
not
die
with
her.
You
are
my
queen,
my
sword
is
yours,
but
do
not
ask
me
to
stand
aside
as
you
climb
on
Drogo’s
pyre.
I
will
not
watch
you
burn.”

“Is
that
what
you
fear?”
Dany
kissed
him
lightly
on
his
broad
forehead.
“I
am
not
such
a
child
as
that,
sweet
ser.”

“You
do
not
mean
to
die
with
him?
You
swear
it,
my
queen?”

“I
swear
it,”
she
said
in
the
Common
Tongue
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms
that
by
rights
were
hers.

The
third
level
of
the
platform
was
woven
of
branches
no
thicker
than
a
finger,
and
covered
with
dry
leaves
and
twigs.
They
laid
them
north
to
south,
from
ice
to
fire,
and
piled
them
high
with
soft
cushions
and
sleeping
silks.
The
sun
had
begun
to
lower
toward
the
west
by
the
time
they
were
done.
Dany
called
the
Dothraki
around
her.
Fewer
than
a
hundred
were
left.
How
many
had
Aegon
started
with?
she
wondered.
It
did
not
matter.

“You
will
be
my
khalasar,”
she
told
them.
“I
see
the
faces
of
slaves.
I
free
you.
Take
off
your
collars.
Go
if
you
wish,
no
one
shall
harm
you.
If
you
stay,
it
will
be
as
brothers
and
sisters,
husbands
and
wives.”
The
black
eyes
watched
her,
wary,
expressionless.
“I
see
the
children,
women,
the
wrinkled
faces
of
the
aged.
I
was
a
child
yesterday.
Today
I
am
a
woman.
Tomorrow
I
will
be
old.
To
each
of
you
I
say,
give
me
your
hands
and
your
hearts,
and
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
you.”
She
turned
to
the
three
young
warriors
of
her
khas.
“Jhogo,
to
you
I
give
the
silver-handled
whip
that
was
my
bride
gift,
and
name
you
ko,
and
ask
your
oath,
that
you
will
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

Jhogo
took
the
whip
from
her
hands,
but
his
face
was
confused.
“Khaleesi,”
he
said
hesitantly,
“this
is
not
done.
It
would
shame
me,
to
be
bloodrider
to
a
woman.”

“Aggo,”
Dany
called,
paying
no
heed
to
Jhogo’s
words.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.
“To
you
I
give
the
dragonbone
bow
that
was
my
bride
gift.”
It
was
double-curved,
shiny
black
and
exquisite,
taller
than
she
was.
“I
name
you
ko,
and
ask
your
oath,
that
you
should
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

Aggo
accepted
the
bow
with
lowered
eyes.
“I
cannot
say
these
words.
Only
a
man
can
lead
a
khalasar
or
name
a
ko.”

“Rakharo,”
Dany
said,
turning
away
from
the
refusal,
“you
shall
have
the
great
arakh
that
was
my
bride
gift,
with
hilt
and
blade
chased
in
gold.
And
you
too
I
name
my
ko,
and
ask
that
you
live
and
die
as
blood
of
my
blood,
riding
at
my
side
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm.”

“You
are
khaleesi,”
Rakharo
said,
taking
the
arakh.
“I
shall
ride
at
your
side
to
Vaes
Dothrak
beneath
the
Mother
of
Mountains,
and
keep
you
safe
from
harm
until
you
take
your
place
with
the
crones
of
the
dosh
khaleen.
No
more
can
I
promise.”

She
nodded,
as
calmly
as
if
she
had
not
heard
his
answer,
and
turned
to
the
last
of
her
champions.
“Ser
Jorah
Mormont,”
she
said,
“first
and
greatest
of
my
knights,
I
have
no
bride
gift
to
give
you,
but
I
swear
to
you,
one
day
you
shall
have
from
my
hands
a
longsword
like
none
the
world
has
ever
seen,
dragon-forged
and
made
of
Valyrian
steel.
And
I
would
ask
for
your
oath
as
well.”

“You
have
it,
my
queen,”
Ser
Jorah
said,
kneeling
to
lay
his
sword
at
her
feet.
“I
vow
to
serve
you,
to
obey
you,
to
die
for
you
if
need
be.”

“Whatever
may
come?”

“Whatever
may
come.”

“I
shall
hold
you
to
that
oath.
I
pray
you
never
regret
the
giving
of
it.”
Dany
lifted
him
to
his
feet.
Stretching
on
her
toes
to
reach
his
lips,
she
kissed
the
knight
gently
and
said,
“You
are
the
first
of
my
Queensguard.”

She
could
feel
the
eyes
of
the
khalasar
on
her
as
she
entered
her
tent.
The
Dothraki
were
muttering
and
giving
her
strange
sideways
looks
from
the
corners
of
their
dark
almond
eyes.
They
thought
her
mad,
Dany
realized.
Perhaps
she
was.
She
would
know
soon
enough.
If
I
look
back
I
am
lost.

Her
bath
was
scalding
hot
when
Irri
helped
her
into
the
tub,
but
Dany
did
not
flinch
or
cry
aloud.
She
liked
the
heat.
It
made
her
feel
clean.
Jhiqui
had
scented
the
water
with
the
oils
she
had
found
in
the
market
in
Vaes
Dothrak;
the
steam
rose
moist
and
fragrant.
Doreah
washed
her
hair
and
combed
it
out,
working
loose
the
mats
and
tangles.
Irri
scrubbed
her
back.
Dany
closed
her
eyes
and
let
the
smell
and
the
warmth
enfold
her.
She
could
feel
the
heat
soaking
through
the
soreness
between
her
thighs.
She
shuddered
when
it
entered
her,
and
her
pain
and
stiffness
seemed
to
dissolve.
She
floated.

When
she
was
clean,
her
handmaids
helped
her
from
the
water.
Irri
and
Jhiqui
fanned
her
dry,
while
Doreah
brushed
her
hair
until
it
fell
like
a
river
of
liquid
silver
down
her
back.
They
scented
her
with
spiceflower
and
cinnamon;
a
touch
on
each
wrist,
behind
her
ears,
on
the
tips
of
her
milk-heavy
breasts.
The
last
dab
was
for
her
sex.
Irri’s
finger
felt
as
light
and
cool
as
a
lover’s
kiss
as
it
slid
softly
up
between
her
lips.

Afterward,
Dany
sent
them
all
away,
so
she
might
prepare
Khal
Drogo
for
his
final
ride
into
the
night
lands.
She
washed
his
body
clean
and
brushed
and
oiled
his
hair,
running
her
fingers
through
it
for
the
last
time,
feeling
the
weight
of
it,
remembering
the
first
time
she
had
touched
it,
the
night
of
their
wedding
ride.
His
hair
had
never
been
cut.
How
many
men
could
die
with
their
hair
uncut?
She
buried
her
face
in
it
and
inhaled
the
dark
fragrance
of
the
oils.
He
smelled
like
grass
and
warm
earth,
like
smoke
and
semen
and
horses.
He
smelled
like
Drogo.
Forgive
me,
sun
of
my
life,
she
thought.
Forgive
me
for
all
I
have
done
and
all
I
must
do.
I
paid
the
price,
my
star,
but
it
was
too
high,
too
high…

Dany
braided
his
hair
and
slid
the
silver
rings
onto
his
mustache
and
hung
his
bells
one
by
one.
So
many
bells,
gold
and
silver
and
bronze.
Bells
so
his
enemies
would
hear
him
coming
and
grow
weak
with
fear.
She
dressed
him
in
horsehair
leggings
and
high
boots,
buckling
a
belt
heavy
with
gold
and
silver
medallions
about
his
waist.
Over
his
scarred
chest
she
slipped
a
painted
vest,
old
and
faded,
the
one
Drogo
had
loved
best.
For
herself
she
chose
loose
sandsilk
trousers,
sandals
that
laced
halfway
up
her
legs,
and
a
vest
like
Drogo’s.

The
sun
was
going
down
when
she
called
them
back
to
carry
his
body
to
the
pyre.
The
Dothraki
watched
in
silence
as
Jhogo
and
Aggo
bore
him
from
the
tent.
Dany
walked
behind
them.
They
laid
him
down
on
his
cushions
and
silks,
his
head
toward
the
Mother
of
Mountains
far
to
the
northeast.

“Oil,”
she
commanded,
and
they
brought
forth
the
jars
and
poured
them
over
the
pyre,
soaking
the
silks
and
the
brush
and
the
bundles
of
dry
grass,
until
the
oil
trickled
from
beneath
the
logs
and
the
air
was
rich
with
fragrance.
“Bring
my
eggs,”
Dany
commanded
her
handmaids.
Something
in
her
voice
made
them
run.

Ser
Jorah
took
her
arm.
“My
queen,
Drogo
will
have
no
use
for
dragon’s
eggs
in
the
night
lands.
Better
to
sell
them
in
Asshai.
Sell
one
and
we
can
buy
a
ship
to
take
us
back
to
the
Free
Cities.
Sell
all
three
and
you
will
be
a
wealthy
woman
all
your
days.”

“They
were
not
given
to
me
to
sell,”
Dany
told
him.

She
climbed
the
pyre
herself
to
place
the
eggs
around
her
sun-and-stars.
The
black
beside
his
heart,
under
his
arm.
The
green
beside
his
head,
his
braid
coiled
around
it.
The
cream-and-gold
down
between
his
legs.
When
she
kissed
him
for
the
last
time,
Dany
could
taste
the
sweetness
of
the
oil
on
his
lips.

As
she
climbed
down
off
the
pyre,
she
noticed
Mirri
Maz
Duur
watching
her.
“You
are
mad,”
the
godswife
said
hoarsely.

“Is
it
so
far
from
madness
to
wisdom?”
Dany
asked.
“Ser
Jorah,
take
this
maegi
and
bind
her
to
the
pyre.”

“To
the…
my
queen,
no,
hear
me…”

“Do
as
I
say.”
Still
he
hesitated,
until
her
anger
flared.
“You
swore
to
obey
me,
whatever
might
come.
Rakharo,
help
him.”

The
godswife
did
not
cry
out
as
they
dragged
her
to
Khal
Drogo’s
pyre
and
staked
her
down
amidst
his
treasures.
Dany
poured
the
oil
over
the
woman’s
head
herself.
“I
thank
you,
Mirri
Maz
Duur,”
she
said,
“for
the
lessons
you
have
taught
me.”

“You
will
not
hear
me
scream,”
Mirri
responded
as
the
oil
dripped
from
her
hair
and
soaked
her
clothing.

“I
will,”
Dany
said,
“but
it
is
not
your
screams
I
want,
only
your
life.
I
remember
what
you
told
me.
Only
death
can
pay
for
life.”
Mirri
Maz
Duur
opened
her
mouth,
but
made
no
reply.
As
she
stepped
away,
Dany
saw
that
the
contempt
was
gone
from
the
maegi’s
flat
black
eyes;
in
its
place
was
something
that
might
have
been
fear.
Then
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
watch
the
sun
and
look
for
the
first
star.

When
a
horselord
dies,
his
horse
is
slain
with
him,
so
he
might
ride
proud
into
the
night
lands.
The
bodies
are
burned
beneath
the
open
sky,
and
the
khal
rises
on
his
fiery
steed
to
take
his
place
among
the
stars.
The
more
fiercely
the
man
burned
in
life,
the
brighter
his
star
will
shine
in
the
darkness.

Jhogo
spied
it
first.
“There,”
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice.
Dany
looked
and
saw
it,
low
in
the
east.
The
first
star
was
a
comet,
burning
red.
Bloodred;
fire
red;
the
dragon’s
tail.
She
could
not
have
asked
for
a
stronger
sign.

Dany
took
the
torch
from
Aggo’s
hand
and
thrust
it
between
the
logs.
The
oil
took
the
fire
at
once,
the
brush
and
dried
grass
a
heartbeat
later.
Tiny
flames
went
darting
up
the
wood
like
swift
red
mice,
skating
over
the
oil
and
leaping
from
bark
to
branch
to
leaf.
A
rising
heat
puffed
at
her
face,
soft
and
sudden
as
a
lover’s
breath,
but
in
seconds
it
had
grown
too
hot
to
bear.
Dany
stepped
backward.
The
wood
crackled,
louder
and
louder.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
began
to
sing
in
a
shrill,
ululating
voice.
The
flames
whirled
and
writhed,
racing
each
other
up
the
platform.
The
dusk
shimmered
as
the
air
itself
seemed
to
liquefy
from
the
heat.
Dany
heard
logs
spit
and
crack.
The
fires
swept
over
Mirri
Maz
Duur.
Her
song
grew
louder,
shriller…
then
she
gasped,
again
and
again,
and
her
song
became
a
shuddering
wail,
thin
and
high
and
full
of
agony.

And
now
the
flames
reached
her
Drogo,
and
now
they
were
all
around
him.
His
clothing
took
fire,
and
for
an
instant
the
khal
was
clad
in
wisps
of
floating
orange
silk
and
tendrils
of
curling
smoke,
grey
and
greasy.
Dany’s
lips
parted
and
she
found
herself
holding
her
breath.
Part
of
her
wanted
to
go
to
him
as
Ser
Jorah
had
feared,
to
rush
into
the
flames
to
beg
for
his
forgiveness
and
take
him
inside
her
one
last
time,
the
fire
melting
the
flesh
from
their
bones
until
they
were
as
one,
forever.

She
could
smell
the
odor
of
burning
flesh,
no
different
than
horseflesh
roasting
in
a
firepit.
The
pyre
roared
in
the
deepening
dusk
like
some
great
beast,
drowning
out
the
fainter
sound
of
Mirri
Maz
Duur’s
screaming
and
sending
up
long
tongues
of
flame
to
lick
at
the
belly
of
the
night.
As
the
smoke
grew
thicker,
the
Dothraki
backed
away,
coughing.
Huge
orange
gouts
of
fire
unfurled
their
banners
in
that
hellish
wind,
the
logs
hissing
and
cracking,
glowing
cinders
rising
on
the
smoke
to
float
away
into
the
dark
like
so
many
newborn
fireflies.
The
heat
beat
at
the
air
with
great
red
wings,
driving
the
Dothraki
back,
driving
off
even
Mormont,
but
Dany
stood
her
ground.
She
was
the
blood
of
the
dragon,
and
the
fire
was
in
her.

She
had
sensed
the
truth
of
it
long
ago,
Dany
thought
as
she
took
a
step
closer
to
the
conflagration,
but
the
brazier
had
not
been
hot
enough.
The
flames
writhed
before
her
like
the
women
who
had
danced
at
her
wedding,
whirling
and
singing
and
spinning
their
yellow
and
orange
and
crimson
veils,
fearsome
to
behold,
yet
lovely,
so
lovely,
alive
with
heat.
Dany
opened
her
arms
to
them,
her
skin
flushed
and
glowing.
This
is
a
wedding,
too,
she
thought.
Mirri
Maz
Duur
had
fallen
silent.
The
godswife
thought
her
a
child,
but
children
grow,
and
children
learn.

Another
step,
and
Dany
could
feel
the
heat
of
the
sand
on
the
soles
of
her
feet,
even
through
her
sandals.
Sweat
ran
down
her
thighs
and
between
her
breasts
and
in
rivulets
over
her
cheeks,
where
tears
had
once
run.
Ser
Jorah
was
shouting
behind
her,
but
he
did
not
matter
anymore,
only
the
fire
mattered.
The
flames
were
so
beautiful,
the
loveliest
things
she
had
ever
seen,
each
one
a
sorcerer
robed
in
yellow
and
orange
and
scarlet,
swirling
long
smoky
cloaks.
She
saw
crimson
firelions
and
great
yellow
serpents
and
unicorns
made
of
pale
blue
flame;
she
saw
fish
and
foxes
and
monsters,
wolves
and
bright
birds
and
flowering
trees,
each
more
beautiful
than
the
last.
She
saw
a
horse,
a
great
grey
stallion
limned
in
smoke,
its
flowing
mane
a
nimbus
of
blue
flame.
Yes,
my
love,
my
sun-and-stars,
yes,
mount
now,
ride
now.

Her
vest
had
begun
to
smolder,
so
Dany
shrugged
it
off
and
let
it
fall
to
the
ground.
The
painted
leather
burst
into
sudden
flame
as
she
skipped
closer
to
the
fire,
her
breasts
bare
to
the
blaze,
streams
of
milk
flowing
from
her
red
and
swollen
nipples.
Now,
she
thought,
now,
and
for
an
instant
she
glimpsed
Khal
Drogo
before
her,
mounted
on
his
smoky
stallion,
a
flaming
lash
in
his
hand.
He
smiled,
and
the
whip
snaked
down
at
the
pyre,
hissing.

She
heard
a
crack,
the
sound
of
shattering
stone.
The
platform
of
wood
and
brush
and
grass
began
to
shift
and
collapse
in
upon
itself.
Bits
of
burning
wood
slid
down
at
her,
and
Dany
was
showered
with
ash
and
cinders.
And
something
else
came
crashing
down,
bouncing
and
rolling,
to
land
at
her
feet;
a
chunk
of
curved
rock,
pale
and
veined
with
gold,
broken
and
smoking.
The
roaring
filled
the
world,
yet
dimly
through
the
firefall
Dany
heard
women
shriek
and
children
cry
out
in
wonder.

Only
death
can
pay
for
life.

And
there
came
a
second
crack,
loud
and
sharp
as
thunder,
and
the
smoke
stirred
and
whirled
around
her
and
the
pyre
shifted,
the
logs
exploding
as
the
fire
touched
their
secret
hearts.
She
heard
the
screams
of
frightened
horses,
and
the
voices
of
the
Dothraki
raised
in
shouts
of
fear
and
terror,
and
Ser
Jorah
calling
her
name
and
cursing.
No,
she
wanted
to
shout
to
him,
no,
my
good
knight,
do
not
fear
for
me.
The
fire
is
mine.
I
am
Daenerys
Stormborn,
daughter
of
dragons,
bride
of
dragons,
mother
of
dragons,
don’t
you
see?
Don’t
you
SEE?
With
a
belch
of
flame
and
smoke
that
reached
thirty
feet
into
the
sky,
the
pyre
collapsed
and
came
down
around
her.
Unafraid,
Dany
stepped
forward
into
the
firestorm,
calling
to
her
children.

The
third
crack
was
as
loud
and
sharp
as
the
breaking
of
the
world.

When
the
fire
died
at
last
and
the
ground
became
cool
enough
to
walk
upon,
Ser
Jorah
Mormont
found
her
amidst
the
ashes,
surrounded
by
blackened
logs
and
bits
of
glowing
ember
and
the
burnt
bones
of
man
and
woman
and
stallion.
She
was
naked,
covered
with
soot,
her
clothes
turned
to
ash,
her
beautiful
hair
all
crisped
away…
yet
she
was
unhurt.

The
cream-and-gold
dragon
was
suckling
at
her
left
breast,
the
green-and-bronze
at
the
right.
Her
arms
cradled
them
close.
The
black-and-scarlet
beast
was
draped
across
her
shoulders,
its
long
sinuous
neck
coiled
under
her
chin.
When
it
saw
Jorah,
it
raised
its
head
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
as
red
as
coals.

Wordless,
the
knight
fell
to
his
knees.
The
men
of
her
khas
came
up
behind
him.
Jhogo
was
the
first
to
lay
his
arakh
at
her
feet.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
he
murmured,
pushing
his
face
to
the
smoking
earth.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
she
heard
Aggo
echo.
“Blood
of
my
blood,”
Rakharo
shouted.

And
after
them
came
her
handmaids,
and
then
the
others,
all
the
Dothraki,
men
and
women
and
children,
and
Dany
had
only
to
look
at
their
eyes
to
know
that
they
were
hers
now,
today
and
tomorrow
and
forever,
hers
as
they
had
never
been
Drogo’s.

As
Daenerys
Targaryen
rose
to
her
feet,
her
black
hissed,
pale
smoke
venting
from
its
mouth
and
nostrils.
The
other
two
pulled
away
from
her
breasts
and
added
their
voices
to
the
call,
translucent
wings
unfolding
and
stirring
the
air,
and
for
the
first
time
in
hundreds
of
years,
the
night
came
alive
with
the
music
of
dragons.

The

Its
founder,
Orys
Baratheon,
was
rumored
to
be
Aegon
the
Dragon’s
bastard
brother.
Orys
rose
through
the
ranks
to
become

commanders.
When

defeated
and
slew
Argilac
the
Arrogant,
the
last
Storm
King,
Aegon
rewarded
him
with
Argilac’s
castle,

and
adopted
the
banner,
honors,
and
words
of
her
line.
The

HOUSE
TULLY

The
Tullys
never
reigned
as
kings,
though
they
held
rich
lands
and
the
great
castle
at
Riverrun
for
a
thousand
years.
During
the
Wars
of
Conquest,
the
riverlands
belonged
to
Harren
the
Black,
King
of
the
Isles.
Harren’s
grandfather,
King
Harwyn
Hardhand,
had
taken
the
Trident
from
Arrec
the
Storm
King,
whose
ancestors
had
conquered
all
the
way
to
the
Neck
three
hundred
years
earlier,
slaying
the
last
of
the
old
River
Kings.
A
vain
and
bloody
tyrant,
Harren
the
Black
was
little
loved
by
those
he
ruled,
and
many
of
the
river
lords
deserted
him
to
join
Aegon’s
army.
First
among
those
was
Edmyn
Tully
of
Riverrun.
When
Harren
and
his
line
perished
in
the
burning
of
Harrenhal,
Aegon
rewarded
House
Tully
by
raising
Lord
Edmyn
to
dominion
over
the
lands
of
the
Trident
and
requiring
the
other
river
lords
to
swear
him
fealty.
The
Tully
sigil
is
a
leaping
trout,
silver,
on
a
field
of
rippling
blue
and
red.
The
Tully
words
are
Family,
Duty,
Honor.

HOUSE
TYRELL

The
Tyrells
rose
to
power
as
stewards
to
the
Kings
of
the
Reach,
whose
domains
included
the
fertile
plains
of
the
southwest
from
the
Dornish
marches
and
Blackwater
Rush
to
the
shores
of
the
Sunset
Sea.
Through
the
female
line
they
claim
descent
from
Garth
Greenhand,
gardener
king
of
the
First
Men,
who
wore
a
crown
of
vines
and
flowers
and
made
the
land
bloom.
When
King
Mern,
last
of
the
old
line,
perished
on
the
Field
of
Fire,
his
steward
Harlen
Tyrell
surrendered
Highgarden
to
Aegon
Targaryen,
pledging
fealty.
Aegon
granted
him
the
castle
and
dominion
over
the
Reach.

HOUSE
GREYJOY

The
Greyjoys
of
Pyke
claim
descent
from
the
Grey
King
of
the
Age
of
Heroes.
Legend
says
the
Grey
King
ruled
not
only
the
western
isles
but
the
sea
itself,
and
took
a
mermaid
to
wife.



For
thousands
of
years,
raiders
from
the
Iron
Islands—called
“ironmen”
by
those
they
plundered—were
the
terrors
of
the
seas,
sailing
as
far
as
the
Port
of
Ibben
and
the
Summer
Isles.
They
prided
themselves
on
their
fierceness
in
battle
and
their
sacred
freedoms.
Each
island
had
its
own
“salt
king”
and
“rock
king.”
The
High
King
of
the
Isles
was
chosen
from
among
their
number,
until
King
Urron
made
the
throne
hereditary
by
murdering
the
other
kings
when
they
assembled
for
a
choosing.
Urron’s
own
line
was
extinguished
a
thousand
years
later
when
the
Andals
swept
over
the
islands.
The
Greyjoys,
like
other
island
lords,
intermarried
with
the
conquerors.



The
Iron
Kings
extended
their
rule
far
beyond
the
isles
themselves,
carving
kingdoms
out
of
the
mainland
with
fire
and
sword.
King
Qhored
could
truthfully
boast
that
his
writ
ran
“wherever
men
can
smell
salt
water
or
hear
the
crash
of
waves.”
In
later
centuries,
Qhored’s
descendants
lost
the
Arbor,
Oldtown,
Bear
Island,
and
much
of
the
western
shore.
Still,
come
the
Wars
of
Conquest,
King
Harren
the
Black
ruled
all
the
lands
between
the
mountains,
from
the
Neck
to
the
Blackwater
Rush.
When
Harren
and
his
sons
perished
in
the
fall
of
Harrenhal,
Aegon
Targaryen
granted
the
riverlands
to
House
Tully,
and
allowed
the
surviving
lords
of
the
Iron
Islands
to
revive
their
ancient
custom
and
choose
who
should
have
the
primacy
among
them.
They
chose
Lord
Vickon
Greyjoy
of
Pyke.



The
Greyjoy
sigil
is

golden
kraken
upon
a
black
field.
Their

are
We

HOUSE
MARTELL

Nymeria,
the
warrior
queen
of
the
Rhoyne,
brought
her
ten
thousand
ships
to
land
in
Dorne,
the
southernmost
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
and
took
Lord
Mors
Martell
to
husband.
With
her
help,
he
vanquished
his
rivals
to
rule
all
Dorne.
The
Rhoynar
influence
remains
strong.
Thus
Dornish
rulers
style
themselves
“Prince”
rather
than
“King.”
Under
Dornish
law,
lands
and
titles
pass
to
the
eldest
child,
not
the
eldest
male.
Dorne,
alone
of
the
Seven
Kingdoms,
was
never
conquered
by
Aegon
the
Dragon.
It
was
not
permanently
joined
to
the
realm
until
two
hundred
years
later,
and
then
by
marriage
and
treaty,
not
the
sword.
Peaceable
King
Daeron
II
succeeded
where
the
warriors
had
failed
by
wedding
the
Dornish
princess
Myriah
and
giving
his
own
sister
in
marriage
to
the
reigning
Prince
of
Dorne.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This
one
was
a
bitch.

My
thanks
and
appreciation
go
out
once
again
to
those
stalwart
souls,
my
editors:
Nita
Taublib,
Joy
Chamberlain,
Jane
Johnson,
and
especially
Anne
Lesley
Groell,
for
her
counsel,
her
good
humor,
and
her
vast
forbearance.

Thanks
also
to
my
readers,
for
all
their
kind
and
supportive
e-mails,
and
for
their
patience.
A
special
tip
of
the
helm
to
Lodey
of
the
Three
Fists,
Pod
the
Devil
Bunny,
Trebla
and
Daj
the
Trivial
Kings,
sweet
Caress
of
the
Wall,
Lannister
the
Squirrel
Slayer,
and
the
rest
of
the
Brotherhood
Without
Banners,
that
half-mad
drunken
fellowship
of
brave
knights
and
lovely
ladies
who
throw
the
best
parties
at
worldcon,
year
after
year
after
year.
And
let
me
sound
a
fanfare
too
for
Elio
and
Linda,
who
seem
to
know
the
Seven
Kingdoms
better
than
I
do,
and
help
me
keep
my
continuity
straight.
Their
Westeros
website
and
concordance
is
a
joy
and
a
wonder.

And
thanks
to
Walter
Jon
Williams
for
guiding
me
across
more
salty
seas,
to
Sage
Walker
for
leeches
and
fevers
and
broken
bones,
to
Pati
Nagle
for
HTML
and
spinning
shields
and
getting
all
my
news
up
quickly,
and
to
Melinda
Snodgrass
and
Daniel
Abraham
for
service
that
was
truly
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty.
I
get
by
with
a
little
help
from
my
friends.

No
words
could
suffice
for
Parris,
who
has
been
there
on
the
good
days
and
the
bad
ones
for
every
bloody
page.
All
that
needs
be
said
is
that
I
could
not
sing
this
Song
without
her.





ABOUT
THE
AUTHOR

GEORGE
R.
R.
MARTIN
sold
his
first
story
in
1971
and
has
been
writing
professionally
since
then.
He
spent
ten
years
in
Hollywood
as
a
writer-producer,
working
on
The
Twilight
Zone,
Beauty
and
the
Beast,
and
various
feature
films
and
television
pilots
that
were
never
made.
In
the
mid
’90s
he
returned
to
prose,
his
first
love,
and
began
work
on
his
epic
fantasy
series,
A
Song
of
Ice
and
Fire.
He
has
been
in
the
Seven
Kingdoms
ever
since.
Whenever
he’s
allowed
to
leave,
he
returns
to
Santa
Fe,
New
Mexico,
where
he
lives
with
the
lovely
Parris,
a
big
white
dog
called
Mischa,
and
two
cats
named
Augustus
and
Caligula,
who
think
they
run
the
place.
