Media
anthropology
(also
known
as
anthropology
of
media
or
mass
media)
emphasizes
ethnographic
studies
as
a
means
of
understanding
producers,
audiences,
and
other
cultural
and
social
aspects
of
mass
media.
The
types
of
ethnographic
contexts
explored
range
from
contexts
of
media
production
(e.g.,
ethnographies
of
newsrooms
in
newspapers,
journalists
in
the
field,
film
production)
to
contexts
of
media
reception,
following
audiences
in
their
everyday
responses
to
media.
Other
types
include
cyber
anthropology,
a
relatively
new
area
of
internet
research,
as
well
as
ethnographies
of
other
areas
of
research
which
happen
to
involve
media,
such
as
development
work,
social
movements,
or
health
education.
This
is
in
addition
to
many
classic
ethnographic
contexts,
where
media
such
as
radio,
the
press,
new
media
and
television
have
started
to
make
their
presences
felt
since
the
early
1990s.[39][40]

Music[edit]

Ethnomusicology
Ethnomusicology
is
an
academic
field
encompassing
various
approaches
to
the
study
of
music
(broadly
defined),
that
emphasize
its
cultural,
social,
material,
cognitive,
biological,
and
other
dimensions
or
contexts
instead
of
or
in
addition
to
its
isolated
sound
component
or
any
particular
repertoire.

Visual[edit]
Main
article:
Visual
anthropology
Visual
anthropology
is
concerned,
in
part,
with
the
study
and
production
of
ethnographic
photography,
film
and,
since
the
mid-1990s,
new
media.
While
the
term
is
sometimes
used
interchangeably
with
ethnographic
film,
visual
anthropology
also
encompasses
the
anthropological
study
of
visual
representation,
including
areas
such
as
performance,
museums,
art,
and
the
production
and
reception
of
mass
media.
Visual
representations
from
all
cultures,
such
as
sandpaintings,
tattoos,
sculptures
and
reliefs,
cave
paintings,
scrimshaw,
jewelry,
hieroglyphics,
paintings
and
photographs
are
included
in
the
focus
of
visual
anthropology.

Economic[edit]
Main
article:
Economic
anthropology
Economic
anthropology
attempts
to
explain
human
economic
behavior
in
its
widest
historic,
geographic
and
cultural
scope.
It
has
a
complex
relationship
with
the
discipline
of
economics,
of
which
it
is
highly
critical.
Its
origins
as
a
sub-field
of
anthropology
begin
with
the
Polish-British
founder
of
Anthropology,
Bronislaw
Malinowski,
and
his
French
compatriot,
Marcel
Mauss,
on
the
nature
of
gift-giving
exchange
(or
reciprocity)
as
an
alternative
to
market
exchange.
Economic
Anthropology
remains,
for
the
most
part,
focused
upon
exchange.
The
school
of
thought
derived
from
Marx
and
known
as
Political
Economy
focuses
on
production,
in
contrast.[41]
Economic
Anthropologists
have
abandoned
the
primitivist
niche
they
were
relegated
to
by
economists,
and
have
now
turned
to
examine
corporations,
banks,
and
the
global
financial
system
from
an
anthropological
perspective.

Political
economy[edit]
Main

Political
economy
in
anthropology
Political
economy
in
anthropology
is
the
application
of
the
theories
and
methods
of
Historical
Materialism
to
the
traditional
concerns
of
anthropology,
including,
but
not
limited
to,
non-capitalist
societies.
Political
Economy
introduced
questions
of
history
and
colonialism
to
ahistorical
anthropological
theories
of
social
structure
and
culture.
Three
main
areas
of
interest
rapidly
developed.
The
first
of
these
areas
was
concerned
with
the
"pre-capitalist"
societies
that
were
subject
to
evolutionary
"tribal"
stereotypes.
Sahlins
work
on
Hunter-gatherers
as
the
'original
affluent
society'
did
much
to
dissipate
that
image.
The
second
area
was
concerned
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
world's
population
at
the
time,
the
peasantry,
many
of
whom
were
involved
in
complex
revolutionary
wars
such
as
in
Vietnam.
The
third
area
was
on
colonialism,
imperialism,
and
the
creation
of
the
capitalist
world-system.[42]
More
recently,
these
Political
Economists
have
more
directly
addressed
issues
of
industrial
(and
post-industrial)
capitalism
around
the
world.

Applied[edit]
Main
article:
Applied
anthropology
Applied
Anthropology
refers
to
the
application
of
the
method
and
theory
of
anthropology
to
the
analysis
and
solution
of
practical
problems.
It
is
a,
"complex
of
related,
research-based,
instrumental
methods
which
produce
change
or
stability
in
specific
cultural
systems
through
the
provision
of
data,
initiation
of
direct
action,
and/or
the
formulation
of
policy".[43]
More
simply,
applied
anthropology
is
the
practical
side
of
anthropological
research;
it
includes
researcher
involvement
and
activism
within
the
participating
community.
It
is
closely
related
to
Development
anthropology
(distinct
from
the
more
critical
Anthropology
of
development).

Development[edit]
Main
article:
anthropology
of
development
Anthropology
of
development
tends
to
view
development
from
a
critical
perspective.
The
kind
of
issues
addressed
and
implications
for
the
approach
simply
involve
pondering
why,
if
a
key
development
goal
is
to
alleviate
poverty,
is
poverty
increasing?
Why
is
there
such
a
gap
between
plans
and
outcomes?
Why
are
those
working
in
development
so
willing
to
disregard
history
and
the
lessons
it
might
offer?
Why
is
development
so
externally
driven
rather
than
having
an
internal
basis?
In
short
why
does
so
much
planned
development
fail?

Kinship
can
refer
both
to
the
study
of
the
patterns
of
social
relationships
in
one
or
more
human
cultures,
or
it
can
refer
to
the
patterns
of
social
relationships
themselves.
Over
its
history,
anthropology
has
developed
a
number
of
related
concepts
and
terms,
such
as
"descent",
"descent
groups",
"lineages",
"affines",
"cognates",
and
even
"fictive
kinship".
Broadly,
kinship
patterns
may
be
considered
to
include
people
related
both
by
descent
(one's
social
relations
during
development),
and
also
relatives
by

Feminist[edit]
Main
article:
Feminist
anthropology
Feminist
anthropology
is
a
four
field
approach
to
anthropology
(archeological,
biological,
cultural,
linguistic)
that
seeks
to
reduce
male
bias
in
research
findings,
anthropological
hiring
practices,
and
the
scholarly
production
of
knowledge.
Anthropology
engages
often
with
feminists
from
non-Western
traditions,
whose
perspectives
and
experiences
can
differ
from
those
of
white
European
and
American
feminists.
Historically,
such
'peripheral'
perspectives
have
sometimes
been
marginalized
and
regarded
as
less
valid
or
important
than
knowledge
from
the
western
world.
Feminist
anthropologists
have
claimed
that
their
research
helps
to
correct
this
systematic
bias
in
mainstream
feminist
theory.
Feminist
anthropologists
are
centrally
concerned
with
the
construction
of
gender
across
societies.
Feminist
anthropology
is
inclusive
of
birth
anthropology
as
a
specialization.

Medical
anthropology
is
an
interdisciplinary
field
which
studies
"human
health
and
disease,
health
care
systems,
and
biocultural
adaptation".[44]
Currently,
research
in
medical
anthropology
is
one
of
the
main
growth
areas
in
the
field
of
anthropology
as
a
whole.
It
focuses
on
the
following
six
basic
fields:[citation
needed]

the
development
of
systems
of
medical
knowledge
and
medical
care
the
patient-physician
relationship
the
integration
of
alternative
medical
systems
in
culturally
diverse
environments
the
interaction
of
social,
environmental
and
biological
factors
which
influence
health
and
illness
both
in
the
individual
and
the
community
as
a
whole
the
critical
analysis
of
interaction
between
psychiatric
services
and
migrant
populations
("critical
ethnopsychiatry":
Beneduce

2007)
the
impact
of
biomedicine
and
biomedical
technologies
in
non-Western
settings
Other
subjects
that
have
become
central
to
medical
anthropology
worldwide
are
violence
and
social
suffering
(Farmer,
1999,
2003;
Beneduce,
2010)
as
well
as
other
issues
that
involve
physical
and
psychological
harm
and
suffering
that
are
not
a
result
of
illness.
On
the
other
hand,
there
are
fields
that
intersect
with
medical
anthropology
in
terms
of
research
methodology
and
theoretical
production,
such
as
cultural
psychiatry
and
transcultural
psychiatry
or
ethnopsychiatry.

Nutritional[edit]
Main
article:
Nutritional
anthropology
Nutritional
anthropology
is
a
synthetic
concept
that
deals
with
the
interplay
between
economic
systems,
nutritional
status
and
food
security,
and
how
changes
in
the
former
affect
the
latter.
If
economic
and
environmental
changes
in
a
community
affect
access
to
food,
food
security,
and
dietary
health,
then
this
interplay
between
culture
and
biology
is
in
turn
connected
to
broader
historical
and
economic
trends
associated
with
globalization.
Nutritional
status
affects
overall
health
status,
work
performance
potential,
and
the
overall
potential
for
economic
development
(either
in
terms
of
human
development
or
traditional
western
models)
for
any
given
group
of
people.

Psychological[edit]
Main
article:
Psychological
anthropology
Psychological
anthropology
is
an
interdisciplinary
subfield
of
anthropology
that
studies
the
interaction
of
cultural
and
mental
processes.
This
subfield
tends
to
focus
on
ways
in
which
humans'
development
and
enculturation
within
a
particular
cultural
group—with
its
own
history,
language,
practices,
and
conceptual
categories—shape
processes
of
human
cognition,
emotion,
perception,
motivation,
and
mental
health.
It
also
examines
how
the
understanding
of
cognition,
emotion,
motivation,
and
similar
psychological
processes
inform
or
constrain
our
models
of
cultural
and
social
processes.[45][46]

Cognitive[edit]
Main
article:
Cognitive
anthropology
Cognitive
anthropology
seeks
to
explain
patterns
of
shared
knowledge,
cultural
innovation,
and
transmission
over
time
and
space
using
the
methods
and
theories
of
the
cognitive
sciences
(especially
experimental
psychology
and
evolutionary
biology)
often
through
close
collaboration
with
historians,
ethnographers,
archaeologists,
linguists,
musicologists
and
other
specialists
engaged
in
the
description
and
interpretation
of
cultural
forms.
Cognitive
anthropology
is
concerned
with
what
people
from
different
groups
know
and
how
that
implicit
knowledge
changes
the
way
people
perceive
and
relate
to
the
world
around
them.[47]

Transpersonal[edit]
Main
article:
Transpersonal
anthropology
Transpersonal
anthropology
studies
the
relationship
between
altered
states
of
consciousness
and
culture.
As
with
transpersonal
psychology,
the
field
is
much
concerned
with
altered
states
of
consciousness
(ASC)
and
transpersonal
experience.
However,
the
field
differs
from
mainstream
transpersonal
psychology
in
taking
more
cognizance
of
cross-cultural
issues—for
instance,
the
roles
of
myth,
ritual,
diet,
and
texts
in
evoking
and
interpreting
extraordinary
experiences
(Young
and
Goulet
1994).

Political[edit]
Main
article:
Political
anthropology
Political
anthropology
concerns
the
structure
of
political
systems,
looked
at
from
the
basis
of
the
structure
of
societies.
Political
anthropology
developed
as
a
discipline
concerned
primarily
with
politics
in
stateless
societies,
a
new
development
started
from
the
1960s,
and
is
still
unfolding:
anthropologists
started
increasingly
to
study
more
"complex"
social
settings
in
which
the
presence
of
states,
bureaucracies
and
markets
entered
both
ethnographic
accounts
and
analysis
of
local
phenomena.
The
turn
towards
complex
societies
meant
that
political
themes
were
taken
up
at
two
main
levels.
First
of
all,
anthropologists
continued
to
study
political
organization
and
political
phenomena
that
lay
outside
the
state-regulated
sphere
(as
in
patron-client
relations
or
tribal
political
organization).
Second
of
all,
anthropologists
slowly
started
to
develop
a
disciplinary
concern
with
states
and
their
institutions
(and
of
course
on
the
relationship
between
formal
and
informal
political
institutions).
An
anthropology
of
the
state
developed,
and
it
is
a
most
thriving
field
today.
Geertz'
comparative
work
on
"Negara",
the
Balinese
state
is
an
early,
famous
example.

Legal[edit]
Main
article:
Legal
anthropology
Legal
anthropology
or
anthropology
of
law
specializes
in
"the
cross-cultural
study
of
social
ordering".[48]
Earlier
legal
anthropological
research
often
focused
more
narrowly
on
conflict
management,
crime,
sanctions,
or
formal
regulation.
More
recent
applications
include
issues
such
as
human
rights,
legal
pluralism,[49]
and
political
uprisings.

Public[edit]
Main
article:
Public

Public
Anthropology
was
created
by
Robert
Borofsky,
a
professor
at

Pacific
University,
to
"demonstrate
the
ability
of
anthropology
and
anthropologists
to
effectively
address

-
illuminating

of

as
well
as
encouraging
broad,
public
conversations
about
them
with
the
explicit
goal
of
fostering
social
change"

Digital
anthropology
is
the
study
of
the
relationship
between
humans
and
digital-era
technology,
and
extends
to
various
areas
where
anthropology
and
technology
intersect.
It
is
sometimes
grouped
with
sociocultural
anthropology,
and
sometimes
considered
part
of
material
culture.
The
field
is
new,
and
thus
has
a
variety
of
names
with
a
variety
of
emphases.
These
include
techno-anthropology,[51]
digital
ethnography,
cyberanthropology,[52]
and
virtual

Ecological[edit]
Main
article:
Ecological
anthropology
Ecological
anthropology
is
defined
as
the
"study
of
cultural
adaptations
to
environments".[54]
The
sub-field
is
also
defined
as,
"the
study
of
relationships
between
a
population
of
humans
and
their
biophysical
environment".[55]
The
focus
of
its
research
concerns
"how
cultural
beliefs
and
practices
helped
human
populations
adapt
to
their
environments,
and
how
people
used
elements
of
their
culture
to
maintain
their
ecosystems."[54]

Environmental[edit]
Main
article:
Environmental
anthropology
Environmental
anthropology
is
a
sub-specialty
within
the
field
of
anthropology
that
takes
an
active
role
in
examining
the
relationships
between
humans
and
their
environment
across
space
and
time.[56]
The
contemporary
perspective
of
environmental
anthropology,
and
arguably
at
least
the
backdrop,
if
not
the
focus
of
most
of
the
ethnographies
and
cultural
fieldworks
of
today,
is
political
ecology.
Many
characterize
this
new
perspective
as
more
informed
with
culture,
politics
and
power,
globalization,
localized
issues,
and
more.[57]
The
focus
and
data
interpretation
is
often
used
for
arguments
for/against
or
creation
of
policy,
and
to
prevent
corporate
exploitation
and
damage
of
land.
Often,
the
observer
has
become
an
active
part
of
the
struggle
either
directly
(organizing,
participation)
or
indirectly
(articles,
documentaries,
books,
ethnographies).
Such
is
the
case
with

practices
across
cultures.
Modern
anthropology
assumes
that
there
is
complete
continuity
between
magical
thinking
and
religion,[60][n
6]
and
that
every
religion
is
a
cultural
product,
created
by
the
human
community
that
worships
it.[61]

Urban[edit]
Main
article:
Urban
anthropology
Urban
anthropology
is
concerned
with
issues
of
urbanization,
poverty,
and
neoliberalism.
Ulf
Hannerz
quotes
a
1960s
remark
that
traditional
anthropologists
were
"a
notoriously
agoraphobic
lot,
anti-urban
by
definition".
Various
social
processes
in
the
Western
World
as
well
as
in
the
"Third
World"
(the
latter
being
the
habitual
focus
of
attention
of
anthropologists)
brought
the
attention
of
"specialists
in
'other
cultures'"
closer
to
their
homes.[62]
There
are
two
principle
approaches
in
urban
anthropology:
by
examining
the
types
of
cities
or
examining
the
social
issues
within
the
cities.
These
two
methods
are
overlapping
and
dependent
of
each
other.
By
defining
different
types
of
cities,
one
would
use
social
factors
as
well
as
economic
and
political
factors
to
categorize
the
cities.
By
directly
looking
at
the
different
social
issues,
one
would
also
be
studying
how
they
affect
the
dynamic
of
the
city.[63]

Anthrozoology
Anthrozoology
(also
known
as
"human–animal
studies")
is
the
study
of
interaction
between
living
things.
It
is
a
burgeoning
interdisciplinary
field
that
overlaps
with
a
number
of
other
disciplines,
including
anthropology,
ethology,
medicine,
psychology,
veterinary
medicine
and
zoology.
A
major
focus
of
anthrozoologic
research
is
the
quantifying
of
the
positive
effects
of
human-animal
relationships
on
either
party
and
the
study
of
their
interactions.[64]
It
includes
scholars
from
a
diverse
range
of
fields,
including
anthropology,
sociology,
biology,
and
philosophy.[65][66][n
7]

Biocultural[edit]
Main
article:
Biocultural
anthropology
Biocultural
anthropology
is
the
scientific
exploration
of
the
relationships
between
human
biology
and
culture.
Physical
anthropologists
throughout
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
viewed
this
relationship
from
a
racial
perspective;
that
is,
from
the
assumption
that
typological
human
biological
differences
lead
to
cultural
differences.[67]
After
World
War
II
the
emphasis
began
to
shift
toward
an
effort
to
explore
the
role
culture
plays
in
shaping
human
biology.

Evolutionary[edit]
Main
article:
Evolutionary
anthropology
Evolutionary
anthropology
is
the
interdisciplinary
study
of
the
evolution
of
human
physiology
and
human
behaviour
and
the
relation
between
hominins
and
non-hominin
primates.
Evolutionary
anthropology
is
based
in
natural
science
and
social
science,
combining
the
human
development
with
socioeconomic
factors.
Evolutionary
anthropology
is
concerned
with
both
biological
and
cultural
evolution
of
humans,
past
and
present.
It
is
based
on
a
scientific
approach,
and
brings
together
fields
such
as
archaeology,
behavioral
ecology,
psychology,
primatology,
and
genetics.
It
is
a
dynamic
and
interdisciplinary
field,
drawing
on
many
lines
of
evidence
to
understand
the
human
experience,
past
and
present.

Forensic[edit]
Main
article:
Forensic
anthropology
Forensic
anthropology
is
the
application
of
the
science
of
physical
anthropology
and
human
osteology
in
a
legal
setting,
most
often
in
criminal
cases
where
the
victim's
remains
are
in
the
advanced
stages
of
decomposition.
A
forensic
anthropologist
can
assist
in
the
identification
of
deceased
individuals
whose
remains
are
decomposed,
burned,
mutilated
or
otherwise
unrecognizable.
The
adjective
"forensic"
refers
to
the
application
of
this
subfield
of
science
to
a
court
of
law.

Palaeoanthropology[edit]
Main
article:
Palaeoanthropology
Paleoanthropology
combines
the
disciplines
of
paleontology
and
physical
anthropology.
It
is
the
study
of
ancient
humans,
as
found
in
fossil
hominid
evidence
such
as
petrifacted
bones
and
footprints.

Organizations[edit]
Contemporary
anthropology
is
an
established
science
with
academic
departments
at
most
universities
and
colleges.
The
single
largest
organization
of
Anthropologists
is
the
American
Anthropological
Association
(AAA),
which
was
founded
in
1903.[68]
Membership
is
made
up
of
anthropologists
from
around
the
globe.[69]

In
1989,
a
group
of
European
and
American
scholars
in
the
field
of
anthropology
established
the
European
Association
of
Social
Anthropologists
(EASA)
which
serves
as
a
major
professional
organization
for
anthropologists
working
in
Europe.
The
EASA
seeks
to
advance
the
status
of
anthropology
in
Europe
and
to
increase
visibility
of
marginalized
anthropological
traditions
and
thereby
contribute
to
the
project
of
a
global
anthropology
or
world
anthropology.

Hundreds
of
other
organizations
exist
in
the
various
sub-fields
of
anthropology,
sometimes
divided
up
by
nation
or
region,
and
many
anthropologists
work
with
collaborators
in
other
disciplines,
such
as
geology,
physics,
zoology,
paleontology,
anatomy,
music
theory,
art
history,
sociology
and
so
on,
belonging
to
professional
societies
in
those
disciplines
as
well.[70]

Controversial
ethical
stances[edit]
Anthropologists,
like
other
researchers
(especially
historians
and
scientists
engaged
in
field
research),
have
over
time
assisted
state
policies
and
projects,
especially
colonialism.[71][72]

Some
commentators
have
contended:

That
the
discipline
grew
out
of
colonialism,
perhaps
was
in
league
with
it,
and
derived
some
of
its
key
notions
from
it,
consciously
or
not.
(See,
for
example,
Gough,
Pels
and
Salemink,
but
cf.
Lewis
2004).[73]
That
ethnographic
work
was
often
ahistorical,
writing
about
people
as
if
they
were
"out
of
time"
in
an
"ethnographic
present"
(Johannes
Fabian,
Time
and
Its
Other).
Ethics
of
cultural
relativism[edit]
As
part
of
their
quest
for
scientific
objectivity,
present-day
anthropologists
typically
urge
cultural
relativism,
which
has
an
influence
on
all
the
sub-fields
of
anthropology.[20]
This
is
the
notion
that
cultures
should
not
be
judged
by
another's
values
or
viewpoints,
but
be
examined
dispassionately
on
their
own
terms.
There
should
be
no
notions,
in
good
anthropology,
of
one
culture
being
better
or
worse
than
another
culture.[74]

Ethical
commitments
in
anthropology
include
noticing
and
documenting
genocide,
infanticide,
racism,
mutilation
(including
circumcision
and
subincision),
and
torture.
Topics
like
racism,
slavery,
and
human
sacrifice
attract
anthropological
attention
and
theories
ranging
from
nutritional
deficiencies[75]
to
genes[76]
to
acculturation
have
been
proposed,
not
to
mention
theories
of
colonialism
and
many
others
as
root
causes
of
Man's
inhumanity
to
man.
To
illustrate
the
depth
of
an
anthropological
approach,
one
can
take
just
one
of
these
topics,
such
as
"racism"
and
find
thousands
of
anthropological
references,
stretching
across
all
the
major
and
minor
sub-fields.[77][78]

Ethical
stance
to
military
involvement[edit]
Anthropologists'
involvement
with
the
U.S.
government,
in
particular,
has
caused
bitter
controversy
within
the
discipline.
Franz
Boas
publicly
objected
to
US
participation
in
World
War
I,
and
after
the
war
he
published
a
brief
expose
and
condemnation
of
the
participation
of
several
American
archaeologists
in
espionage
in
Mexico
under
their
cover
as
scientists.

But
by
the
1940s,
many
of
Boas'
anthropologist
contemporaries
were
active
in
the
allied
war
effort
against
the
"Axis"
(Nazi
Germany,
Fascist
Italy,
and
Imperial
Japan).
Many
served
in
the
armed
forces,
while
others
worked
in
intelligence
(for
example,
Office
of
Strategic
Services
and
the
Office
of
War
Information).
At
the
same
time,
David
H.
Price's
work
on
American
anthropology
during
the
Cold
War
provides
detailed
accounts
of
the
pursuit
and
dismissal
of
several
anthropologists
from
their
jobs
for
communist
sympathies.

Attempts
to
accuse
anthropologists
of
complicity
with
the
CIA
and
government
intelligence
activities
during
the
Vietnam
War
years
have
turned
up
surprisingly
little
(although
anthropologist
Hugo
Nutini
was
active
in
the
stillborn
Project
Camelot).[79]
Many
anthropologists
(students
and
teachers)
were
active
in
the
antiwar
movement.
Numerous
resolutions
condemning
the
war
in
all
its
aspects
were
passed
overwhelmingly
at
the
annual
meetings
of
the
American
Anthropological
Association
(AAA).

Professional
anthropological
bodies
often
object
to
the
use
of
anthropology
for
the
benefit
of
the
state.
Their
codes
of
ethics
or
statements
may
proscribe
anthropologists
from
giving
secret
briefings.
The
Association
of
Social
Anthropologists
of
the
UK
and
Commonwealth
(ASA)
has
called
certain
scholarship
ethically
dangerous.
The
AAA's
current
'Statement
of
Professional
Responsibility'
clearly
states
that
"in
relation
with
their
own
government
and
with
host
governments
...
no
secret
research,
no
secret
reports
or
debriefings
of
any
kind
should
be
agreed
to
or
given."

Anthropologists,
along
with
other
social
scientists,
are
working
with
the
US
military
as
part
of
the
US
Army's
strategy
in
Afghanistan.[80]
The
Christian
Science
Monitor
reports
that
"Counterinsurgency
efforts
focus
on
better
grasping
and
meeting
local
needs"
in
Afghanistan,
under
the
Human
Terrain
System
(HTS)
program;
in
addition,
HTS
teams
are
working
with
the
US
military
in
Iraq.[81]
In
2009,
the
American
Anthropological
Association's
Commission
on
the
Engagement
of
Anthropology
with
the
US
Security
and
Intelligence
Communities
released
its
final
report
concluding,
in
part,
that,
"When
ethnographic
investigation
is
determined
by
military
missions,
not
subject
to
external
review,
where
data
collection
occurs
in
the
context
of
war,
integrated
into
the
goals
of
counterinsurgency,
and
in
a
potentially
coercive
environment
–
all
characteristic
factors
of
the
HTS
concept
and
its
application
–
it
can
no
longer
be
considered
a
legitimate
professional
exercise
of
anthropology.
In
summary,
while
we
stress
that
constructive
engagement
between
anthropology
and
the
military
is
possible,
CEAUSSIC
suggests
that
the
AAA
emphasize
the
incompatibility
of
HTS
with
disciplinary
ethics
and
practice
for
job
seekers
and
that
it
further
recognize
the
problem
of
allowing
HTS
to
define
the
meaning
of
"anthropology"
within
DoD."[82]

Post–World
War
II
developments[edit]
Before
WWII
British
'social
anthropology'
and
American
'cultural
anthropology'
were
still
distinct
traditions.
After
the
war,
enough
British
and
American
anthropologists
borrowed
ideas
and
methodological
approaches
from
one
another
that
some
began
to
speak
of
them
collectively
as
'sociocultural'
anthropology.

Basic
trends[edit]
There
are
several
characteristics
that
tend
to
unite
anthropological
work.
One
of
the
central
characteristics
is
that
anthropology
tends
to
provide
a
comparatively
more
holistic
account
of
phenomena
and
tends
to
be
highly
empirical.[19]
The
quest
for
holism
leads
most
anthropologists
to
study
a
particular
place,
problem
or
phenomenon
in
detail,
using
a
variety
of
methods,
over
a
more
extensive
period
than
normal
in
many
parts
of
academia.

In
the
1990s
and
2000s
(decade),
calls
for
clarification
of
what
constitutes
a
culture,
of
how
an
observer
knows
where
his
or
her
own
culture
ends
and
another
begins,
and
other
crucial
topics
in
writing
anthropology
were
heard.
These
dynamic
relationships,
between
what
can
be
observed
on
the
ground,
as
opposed
to
what
can
be
observed
by
compiling
many
local
observations
remain
fundamental
in
any
kind
of
anthropology,
whether
cultural,
biological,
linguistic
or
archaeological.[83]

Biological
anthropologists
are
interested
in
both
human
variation[84]
and
in
the
possibility
of
human
universals
(behaviors,
ideas
or
concepts
shared
by
virtually
all
human
cultures).[85]
They
use
many
different
methods
of
study,
but
modern
population
genetics,
participant
observation
and
other
techniques
often
take
anthropologists
"into
the
field,"
which
means
traveling
to
a
community
in
its
own
setting,
to
do
something
called
"fieldwork."
On
the
biological
or
physical
side,
human
measurements,
genetic
samples,
nutritional
data
may
be
gathered
and
published
as
articles
or
monographs.

Along
with
dividing
up
their
project
by
theoretical
emphasis,
anthropologists
typically
divide
the
world
up
into
relevant
time
periods
and
geographic
regions.
Human
time
on
Earth
is
divided
up
into
relevant
cultural
traditions
based
on
material,
such
as
the
Paleolithic
and
the
Neolithic,
of
particular
use
in
archaeology.[citation
needed]
Further
cultural
subdivisions
according
to
tool
types,
such
as
Olduwan
or
Mousterian
or
Levalloisian
help
archaeologists
and
other
anthropologists
in
understanding
major
trends
in
the
human
past.[citation
needed]
Anthropologists
and
geographers
share
approaches
to
Culture
regions
as
well,
since
mapping
cultures
is
central
to
both
sciences.
By
making
comparisons
across
cultural
traditions
(time-based)
and
cultural
regions
(space-based),
anthropologists
have
developed
various
kinds
of
comparative
method,
a
central
part
of
their
science.

Commonalities
between
fields[edit]
Because
anthropology
developed
from
so
many
different
enterprises
(see
History
of
Anthropology),
including
but
not
limited
to
fossil-hunting,
exploring,
documentary
film-making,
paleontology,
primatology,
antiquity
dealings
and
curatorship,
philology,
etymology,
genetics,
regional
analysis,
ethnology,
history,
philosophy,
and
religious
studies,[86][87]
it
is
difficult
to
characterize
the
entire
field
in
a
brief
article,
although
attempts
to
write
histories
of
the
entire
field
have
been
made.[88]

Some
authors
argue
that
anthropology
originated
and
developed
as
the
study
of
"other
cultures",
both
in
terms
of
time
(past
societies)
and
space
(non-European/non-Western
societies).[89]
For
example,
the
classic
of
urban
anthropology,
Ulf
Hannerz
in
the
introduction
to
his
seminal
Exploring
the
City:
Inquiries
Toward
an
Urban
Anthropology
mentions
that
the
"Third
World"
had
habitually
received
most
of
attention;
anthropologists
who
traditionally
specialized
in
"other
cultures"
looked
for
them
far
away
and
started
to
look
"across
the
tracks"
only
in
late
1960s.[90]

Now
there
exist
many
works
focusing
on
peoples
and
topics
very
close
to
the
author's
"home".[91]
It
is
also
argued
that
other
fields
of
study,
like
History
and
Sociology,
on
the
contrary
focus
disproportionately
on
the
West.[92]

In
France,
the
study
of
Western
societies
has
been
traditionally
left
to
sociologists,
but
this
is
increasingly
changing,[93]
starting
in
the
1970s
from
scholars
like
Isac
Chiva
and
journals
like
Terrain
("fieldwork"),
and
developing
with
the
center
founded
by
Marc
Augé
(Le
Centre
d'anthropologie
des
mondes
contemporains,
the
Anthropological
Research
Center
of
Contemporary
Societies).

Since
the
1980s
it
has
become
common
for
social
and
cultural
anthropologists
to
set
ethnographic
research
in
the
North
Atlantic
region,
frequently
examining
the
connections
between
locations
rather
than
limiting
research
to
a
single
locale.
There
has
also
been
a
related
shift
toward
broadening
the
focus
beyond
the
daily
life
of
ordinary
people;
increasingly,
research
is
set
in
settings
such
as
scientific
laboratories,
social
movements,
governmental
and
nongovernmental
organizations
and
businesses.[94]
