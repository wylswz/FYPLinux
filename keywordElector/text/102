it wasn   t listening to his asinine bragging about adultery or pussy grabbing it wasn   t listening to him refer to arianne zucker   s publicist as    the other one    or to zucker as    those legs    it wasn   t listening to billy bush guffawing like a    year old frat boy no  the worst part of the video was watching billy bush coax a woman into letting a man who had just boasted of sexual assault touch her the worst part was seeing her clench her teeth and acquiesce  despite every non verbal cue she gave to demonstrate her repugnance  she kept her body as far as physically possible while she half heartedly submitted to an embrace and a kiss the worst part was watching bush continue to act as the world   s sleaziest    wing man    as he maneuvered zucker to walk arm in arm with trump  demanding that she    choose    which man she   d rather date the worst part was the strange mixture of deep empathy and betrayal i felt as i listened to her laugh nervously and decline to choose  and then faux flirtatiously pick    both    to de escalate the situation i understood what she was experiencing  yet i wanted so badly to see her withdraw her arm i wanted her so badly to say    can we not  i   m here to do a job  not to be whored out to a reality star    i wanted so badly to see her walk away but i knew why she didn   t  because anything she said would have been met with defensiveness  with gaslighting  and with    just harmless fun    that   s the worst part  not the assault  not the sleaziness  it   s having to    just go along with it    or fight to be taken seriously i   m     it   s summertime  i   m behind the clubhouse at the pool  two older boys in my neighborhood are teaching me how to smoke    you have to breathe in as you suck the cigarette  not like a straw  that   ll make you sick    they have a good laugh as they see me go green  gag  and cough until i almost vomit but after a few puffs  i get the hang of it a week later  i   m home alone and there   s a knock at my apartment door  it   s the boys  they have a new pack of smokes  wanna go have a smoke break i go with them  we walk to a small wooded area on the edge of the apartment complex  we huddle around the cigarette pack  i reach to pull out a cigarette when one of the boys pulls it away  out of my reach    you can have one of these  but you   re going to have to suck our dicks    i freeze  they   re joking  they have to be joking  right but one of them starts unzipping his fly i run after an hour of hiding out at a neighbor   s apartment  i don   t tell them because i don   t want to get in trouble for smoking   i go back to my place when i go to my bedroom i see that the window is open they threw dirt on my bed here   s the worst part i   m at a hearing at juvenile court  testifying against the boys  their defense attorney is questioning me    your mother tells me you   re involved with theatre  is that correct       yes       you like to act  is that right       yes       isn   t acting pretending  do you like to pretend          um  yes  but               so it   s fair to say you must have a very good imagination and must be very good at making things up  right    i look at my mother  she looks down at her hands  i feel sick i   m     we   re at a cook out  i   m wearing a tank top and daisy dukes one of my mom   s friends  a guy in his late twenties  looks at me and gives me a slow whistle    man  if you were legal  i   d do you in a heartbeat    i feel naked  but i laugh and smile through clenched teeth here   s the worst part later  when i tell my mom  she smiles and says i   m turning into a beautiful woman  so i shouldn   t be surprised if guys start noticing me i   m    we   re taking a train from baltimore to fort lauderdale  we   ve been on the train for    hours  it   s late at night to pass the time  my mom has been hanging out in the club car i   ve been reading in my seat but get up to check in on her and to get something to drink when i pass through the doors  i spot her playing a card game with a tall guy wearing a wide brimmed hat  she introduces me and we take a moment to chat before i let her know i   m going to sleep  she gives me a kiss goodnight i settle into my seat  close my eyes  and drift to sleep i shift in my seat  and feel the presence of someone else someone staring at me i open my eyes a sliver and between my lashes i see the silhouette of a tall man in a wide brimmed hat i shut my eyes and pretend to sleep and wait  occasionally peeking through my lashes he doesn   t leave for at least   minutes here   s the worst part when i tell my mom  she shakes her head    it was probably a bad dream    i   m       stop wearing such baggy clothes  you have a gorgeous body  you should show off your curves    i   m       don   t be afraid to flirt  it   s the only reason some of these guys will let a female sales rep in the door  use it    i   m       oh  he was just a dirty old man    i   m           just locker room talk      a distraction    i   m        whoa  whoa  whoa  you   re getting way too emotional about this  it   s sad that this happened to you  but all kids get bullied    that   s the worst part it isn   t when it happens  it   s what happens when you talk about it freelance copywriter  word geek  story nerd  proud sjw  fluent in human  badassmotherblogger  www
