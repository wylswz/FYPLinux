to all the writers  readers  and editors of the coffeelicious    it saddens me to say that i will no longer hold the role of creative director of the cr  me  i have decided to step down i   m not sure what that means for the project         i will leave that in the capable hands of the editors  vyoma nupur  bonni rambatan  akshay g  jason smith  abby norman  carina sitkus  and srinath reddy  your founder and editor at large  they conceived of this idea  and i have no doubt they will find a way to carry it forward as there has been  and will be  some speculation about why i chose not to pursue this opportunity  i wanted to take the time to explain my reasons this has nothing to do with  ladyspinster   s story    when i was    i had a livejournal    though the piece is critical of the idea of the cr  me and mentioned me by name  i   m an adult in the world of writing and publishing  people have been paid to write    subtweet    pieces about me that have dragged my image through the mud  i   ve received anonymous hate mail from multiple sources about my writing and my character  my ex husband   s former best friend  and my former internship supervisor  would talk shit about me publicly  both on social media and to people i knew i believe one of the phrases he used was    young  dumb pussy    i can handle criticism of me  my ideas  and my projects in the interest of full disclosure  i was hurt when i read it  at first i have generalized anxiety disorder  which can often make mountains out of molehills  i thought the piece was personal when it wasn   t  and that was made abundantly clear in the comments         so i let it go if i feel personally attacked  my feelings will be hurt just like anyone else   s  but not everyone is going to like what you do  or want to be a part of it  and that   s perfectly fine anyway         i heard whispers about that  and wanted to quash those rumors as quickly as possible i think the cr  me is one of the best ideas to come out of medium in a long time  in a world where so much of our available content is clickbait and authors aren   t getting paid  setting up a place where a talented group could work hard and get paid for what they do is wonderful i hope the coffeelicious continues on with this project  it   s desperately needed i built a magazine up from nothing  it was called real talk every day  i would read through dozens of websites  looking for talent  i didn   t have a prompt people to apply to  i just sent email after email to people i thought were amazing writers  and i built a staff of     over the course of a year we published every week when our group was small  and every day when it was at its peak  i was the sole editor  social media manager  fundraiser         everything  the only reason i gave it up was because i went on disability for my mental health and needed to scale back my projects before i burned out but i love to work  i live to work  i just can   t do this particular work at the moment  apart from my freelance writing  i am unemployed         again  due to my mental health  after a long period of suicidal ideation and a near attempt  i wound up in an inpatient psychiatric facility for three days at the end of april i had to quit my bartending job because it was too stressful  i couldn   t take much of any job because i   m frankly terrified of leaving the house on my own right now  writing is all i have  and i   m still not paying my bills for the past several months  i haven   t paid rent  that   s due to the amazing support from my roommates  who have encouraged me to get well and contribute however i can  my phone bill is overdue  my credit card is maxed  i can   t pick up my adhd and depression medications today because i don   t have the money to cover them         i have to wait until my partner gets home so i can use his credit card  again the point of the cr  me is to pay writers first  that   s how i ran real talk  and that   s how i would have run this  if there came a point where i could pay writers a decent amount of money and then pay myself  that   s what would have happened  but for the meantime  there   s not even money for writers there would be eventually  but not right away and maybe there would be a paycheck for me eventually  but i can   t wait for that day to come  not when my own finances are so dire i write for a few different publications  i   ve started posting links to them on my medium page  but they   re all over my twitter  facebook  tumblr  etc that   s my income  that   s how i survive month to month i have to give more energy to that than i have been  which means giving up a passion project right now fuck         i would have loved to run the cr  me  i know that i would be good at it  when i told my former writers that i was stepping down  they all tried to talk me out of it because they had such a good experience with me  and wanted me to get back in the game again but being an adult means making difficult decisions i want me and my partner to have a place of our own someday  i want to be able to pull my own weight and then some  i want to take vacations and attend conferences and buy books without feeling guilty for    wasting money    if that means i have to copy write instead of build up the cr  me  that   s how it has to be if you follow me here or on any other social media  you   ll know that i   m working on a book series  the depression army field guide  that   s going to be published this fall  and thus far  it   s a two man project all of the crowdfunding  writing  advertising  etc  is being done by me and my writing partner  and it   s a lot to prepare for         especially when i   m also working on my first memoir and novel those are all unpaid gigs for the moment  but i   m at the point in my life and my writing career where it   s time to get published  it   s time for my short stories to be in journals and my essays to be in bigger publications and for me to be an author i   m ready for it  it   s time    and it is  it   s a decision that i made because it   s what   s best for me  for my mental health  my finances  and my career that doesn   t mean that i   m not sincerely sorry to everyone who applied to the cr  me  and who now may have to wait for someone else to take up the post of creative director  i read through everything that came in up to the point that i decided to resign  and had begun to bookmark my favorites  the people i could tell had potential  who i really wanted to work with  no  i will not tell you who  i do hope you all can understand my reasoning for deciding to step down  if not  i understand why this is the best choice  for me  for the cr  me  and for anyone who would be a part of it you deserve full dedication  and right now  i can   t offer that but i fully support the coffeelicious  the cr  me  if it   s still to be called that  and if it carries on   and all of you who share your words in this space  i   ll still be here but as a writer where i belong love and luck to you all passionate about writing  c ptsd memoir in progress  powerful mental health advocacy  all inclusive lover of humanity  coming bylines  av club  hippocampus home to some of the best stories on medium  look around  relax and enjoy one with a sip of coffee
