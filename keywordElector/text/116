i want to quit  because i   m tired  my head is fogged up  and my coffee         as good as it is         hasn   t cleared it  i want to quit because i woke up thismorning before dawn and my limbs ached i want to quit because i can remember what it feels like to have more money than i needed  and to lose it  and to remember it like a kick in the gut today  i want to quit because the way back in is long  hard and unforgiving i want to quit because business is tough  it   s always tough  i   m staring into a mirror    hours a day and daring the reflection to make one wrong move  to make one wrong call  knowing that what i do fails or flies on me i want to quit because i want to sit in my lounge room  playing doom and eating  listening to marvin gaye  doing whatever i can  anything i can to distract myself from the ticking clock and the pressure i   ve always felt to do more  work more  try harder i want to quit because i grew up poor  and i   m terrified that if i risk everything  i   ll die poor too i want to quit because i stand a good chance of failing  every time i take on a client  every time i build a product or start a business or crack open a new dream  and i   ve failed enough times that i don   t want to feel the ground drop out from under me again i want to quit because startups are hard  they   re unforgiving in their statistical chances of disaster  and i know deep down that i   m not a visionary leader or a tech genius  just a guy with big ideas and a decent serving of guts  and i   m not sure that   s enough i want to quit because i got an email from a reader calling me a self centered asshole because i wouldn   t help him build a company for free  and i got a dm from another one who thinks i   m a    vapid waste of space            even though they don   t know me and my life i want to quit because i   d rather drink at    am and smoke a pack of cigarettes a day         that   s my self destructive streak coming out i want to quit because making it seems harder than just settling into being average and not trying  if i didn   t try  i could switch off that part of my brain that wants to  and find a comfortable job and get tired and get done i want to quit because writing means baring a piece of my soul every day and holding it out to the world and saying hey  what do you think of this      and sometimes  asking whether it   s been worth it  trying to open myself to it  and feeling vulnerable i want to quit because i hate putting in effort  and i want to be lazy  and i don   t want to be productive  and i don   t want to get fit  and i don   t want to stay up late trying to push my dreams over the line i want to quit because i   d love to re watch every season of buffy  and that seems a lot better than blogging and designing and drawing up contracts i want to quit because a deal i   ve been working on for months just fell through and now i have to close that gap in projected revenue in some other way i want to quit because jk rowling is a better writer than me  with more credibility and authenticity and characters that people love and a series of books that shaped the childhood of millions  i want to quit because gary vaynerchuk is a better writer than me  with inspirational ideas  messages and game changing concepts that have built thousands of entrepreneurs i want to quit because i   m not either of them  and i   m not elon musk  or paul mccartney  or ian mckaye  or henry rollins  or douglas coupland  or richard branson and no matter how much i read articles that list the    things they havein common  the   morning routine tips that made them successful  the   quotes that inspired them  the    best decisions they ever made or the   traits that helped them achieve their dreams  i   ll probably never reachtheir level but i don   t quit  i don   t quit every single day  when i wake up and i want to i didn   t quit for    years  writing blog posts that nobody read  freaking out in panic attacks and deleting them before i would calm down and start all over again i didn   t quit when businesses failed  when i was broke  when i dropped out of law school  when i lost my record deal  when i was fired  when i was drunk and when i was sitting in a chair across from my therapist trying to explain what drove me to prove the world wrong i   m in love with the companies i   m building  and the products i   m making  though that love rises and falls with my temper on days like today  i   m in love with my readers  when they email me out of the blue to say that they give a shit  i   m in love with my clients and customers  the ones who follow through  who put their faith in me wanting to quit is okay  wanting to walk away from your business is okay  it happens to everyone  here in australia  most of the founders you   ll talk to really look up to the atlassian founders  scott and mike         but do you think they didn   t wake up some days and want to quit  want to walk away and change their names and disappear we all do  no matter how set on our paths and our lives we are  we all want to quit every now and then  because we   re humans  and like i always say         humans are beautiful  but we suck at remembering it i   m emailed by a lot of would be writers and entrepreneurs who are worried that the fact they don   t have total faith in themselves and aren   t completely certain about where their lives are going and the work they   re doing  and the fact that they   re scared and want to quit  means they   re on the wrong path that   s not the case  the right path is the one you want to be on  and yeah  you   ll want to quit  but you   ll be just like the rest of us if you go through that  being an artist  being a creative  being an entrepreneur  it   s about fighting with yourself to keep playing the game when it all feels hopeless it   s about making one more gamble  and every time  setting your sights on a win  instead of leaving the table  this post originally
