i was scrolling through pictures from an incredible writers    conference i attended last week  as i went through them  i had a happy  light feeling in my heart  this was one of those events that feel like they   re changing something in your life  and i enjoyed seeing the faces of new friends i am    the problem    kari grangyesterday was international day of the girl child  and it passed by us largely unnoticed  in   my     day experiment saved my life  i know that sounds dramatic   but the results really were that dramatic  whether you   a few of you are aware i get kidney stone episodes from time to time  usually twice a year or so  trust me  after you   ve gone through it a dozen times it   s not that big of a deal anymore  yes  it hurts like a bastard  but these days i usually just tough through it with a cocktail of aspirin  acetaminophen
