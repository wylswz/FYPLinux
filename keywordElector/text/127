original interview  http   www techiesproject com caitie mccaffrey let   s jump right in  tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i grew up in the midwest first in pennsylvania until i was           and then ohio  and i started programming in high school  during sophomore year i decided to be lazy and take an extra study hall  but the computer science teacher  mrs  petite  hunted me down  along with all the other advanced math students  and said    you should take my class     and i   m so glad she did  i took two and a half years of computer science in high school and just absolutely loved it  my first class was in visual basic  and i made the video game frogger as my final project at the end of my sophomore year i was very nervous  i knew that my school had ap computer science courses but i wasn   t sure if i would be good at it  i asked my teacher mrs  petite who said     of course you would be  sign up     so i did  i took ap computer science a junior year in c   and ap computer science b senior year in java  i fell in love with programming in high school  i loved how quickly i could bring my ideas to life  and so i went into college knowing i wanted to major in computer science how was college for you college was great  i always knew from a young age that i wanted to do engineering or math or science based things  i just liked them in addition to a healthy appreciation of the art  i spent a lot of time writing  reading literature and dabbling painting and pottery  but i had a penchant for the sciences  so when i applied to colleges i focused on schools with computer science departments i eventually chose cornell university in ithaca  new york which has a really excellent computer science program  it is a super tough program but it was really fun  i have some best friends from that program that i still very close with even though we live in different cities in college i also ta   d a class that was the intro to data structures course in java  i also became interested in game design and built a couple video games  via an elective program  i was also incredibly interested in computer graphics because i liked the idea that i could visualize or see what i was making and create art  i also came to realize that i was really bad at linear algebra  or not really bad but i was never going to be great at it  so then i thought maybe i should pick a different area to focus on during college i interned at bunch at different places including stanford   s linear accelerator center  slac  and microsoft at slac i had my first introduction to large scale computing  they had  at the time  one of the larger academic computing clusters that the scientists working at the accelerator could use to analyze and compute all the data they were collecting  in order to do this they needed massive compute  and i worked on the team there that provided it i also did a more traditional internship after my junior year at microsoft  in seattle  i worked on windows live experiences which was how i got involved with networking and found a passion for building things that socially connect people when choosing a full time job after college i really wanted to work in video games  i wasn   t exactly sure what area of computer science i wanted to focus in so i figured i might as well just build something that i think is fun  i ended up landing at microsoft in microsoft studios because i got an offer to work on the gears of war series  an xbox game so let   s dig into those first experiences  how was working seattle  how was working in games i loved working in games  i   m really glad i did it in my early   s  i   m also really glad i   m done  or am on a break from the industry at least for awhile  because it is pretty exhausting  the crazy hours you hear about are      true  but i learned so much in those first six seven years i spent in games because you just work all the time  i loved it and i was having a blast so i don   t regret any of it  just sometimes your priorities change away from just work as you get older so i worked on gears of war   which was a phenomenal opportunity straight out of college that doesn   t happen in the games industry that often  so i got very lucky and i worked my ass off  we were working     hours a week as soon as i started  and i remember sleeping on the floor to finish builds and taking naps as things were compiling  game builds actually take a really long time because you have to compile the assets down and then package it into something the xbox knows how to run  there   s this xkcd comic of     oh  it   s compiling    and that   s a real joke in the game industry i then continued to work in the gears of war franchise on gears of war    as we were working on that         an internal studio instead of microsoft             industries was created to take over the halo franchise from bungie  the studio that created halo in       i was loaned out to     to work on one of the first title applications on the xbox     halo waypoint  originally on the xbox     you had this standard dashboard and all you could really do on the console was play games  i don   t know if people remember that  this was a while ago  and then they added the applications like netflix  hulu  youtube  etc     halo waypoint was also one of the first of what we call title applications  that came out  it was very new  and i jumped on it because i thought that was really exciting at the end of the halo waypoint project  i learned that     industries had positions open  so i moved over to that studio full time when it was about    or    people  i was web service developer number   that they hired  so that was pretty cool because we got to take over this whole charter of the halo universe  i was really young  only     so this was an amazing opportunity  so i just ran with it halo was really fun  it was this crazy wonderful experience  it was very career defining for me  it   s definitely the biggest thing i   ve done at this point  we re wrote all of the halo services in azure  which is microsoft   s cloud compute  we also built a lot of it on top of this microsoft research technology called orleans  the orleans team was amazing we approached them and said     hey  we like your stuff  we would like to build all of the halo services  will you work with us     and they were crazy enough to say     yes     then we were crazy enough to think we could do this so we did it and it was amazing  it really led me to love  not only games and creating the social aspects of it  but also introduced me to distributed systems what was it like to be a woman in the game industry there   s obviously a lot of controversy going on about the games industry now  everyone knows about all the harassment  especially a lot of women are facing in that industry  especially online  and all the horror stories that are coming out  i actually had a very positive experience  at least with my studio  i attribute a lot of that to the fact that bonnie ross is the studio general manager  and she runs all of halo at microsoft  and then the executive producer of halo   was kiki wolfkill  another really fantastic woman  and so  when i joined the studio  i was literally joining a studio run by women  and it was fantastic  i think it just set the tone  even on little things like t shirt orders always included female sizes even when we were only ordering like    shirts  things like that  the studio always felt very inclusive trade shows were a little different  people would come up to me and say     oh  you   re not in marketing     and i   m like     no dude  i make the game     and that was always surprising to people  i used to count the number of times a person said    really     i got up to five once so you left     industries  what was the impetus some of it was just         i   d been at microsoft for five  six years  something like that  problems start looking more of the same and there was just some things i wanted to go explore outside in other parts of the industry  i was also very burnt out  to be perfectly honest  i was working really long hours even after we shipped halo   shipping halo   was one of the most magical  sleep deprived  wonderful experiences of my life  i loved every minute of it and leaving halo in      was really hard  but sometimes you get to a point where you want to do or explore other things i then did a year at hbo  which started up a studio in seattle  essentially i was working on what became hbo now  i stayed there for only a year  it wasn   t the best culture fit for me so then i made the decision to move to san francisco  i knew a lot of people in san francisco  i was super excited by the tech scene  just because a lot of stuff is happening and it   s interesting  so i started looking around and interviewed with literally everyone  chuckles   i had a bunch of job offers from some really amazing places but ended up deciding on taking a job at twitter  and so that   s where i am now what excites you in your work now  is there a thread across all your work  from games to twitter i really love distributed systems  the space is developing really quickly as applications have to scale to handle larger amounts of data that   s globally distributed  in addition we now expect services to be always on  down time isn   t acceptable  so there are a lot of really hard problems in this space  and a lot of overlap between research and industry that really excites me i also love twitter as a platform  just like games  i   m helping to build social connected experiences that bring people together  i   ve learned a lot on twitter  and made some really close friends who i first connected with via twitter  i also think twitter does a lot of good in the world  giving people a voice how did you get into speaking and writing  how has that experience been for you so i kind of got pushed into speaking actually  i   ve been very fortunate in my career to have a bunch of people who have sponsored me  so at microsoft  clemens vasters and scott hanselman sought me out and encouraged me to come talk on their podcasts  i also have a friend kate matusdaria who made the intro that led to my first conference talk at surge      i also got invited to speak at ordev      basically because i got into a heated argument on twitter with kelly sommers and some folks from the node js community about orleans  afterwards one of the conference organizers reached out to me saying     we are really interested in learning more about orleans and saw the conversation on twitter  would you like to come talk about it     so i responded    i guess  sure  that sounds great    my first conference talks went over very well  from those came more talk invitations and most recently an article on the verification of a distributed system that was published in the communications of the acm what   s it been like being a senior level woman in tech in silicon valley it   s definitely hard  and it gets harder as you get more senior i think  but i   m in tech because all the toys i want to play with are here  and i love the work i do  so i   m here for the long haul most days it is fine but every now and then there are things that grate on you  there   s a lot of little things  like getting offered    uni sex    aka men   s sized shirts  or people being surprised when you say i   m a tech lead  then there are some people who want to see your credentials  at this point i   m just like     do you need a moment to google me  hold on i   ll wait     honestly the reason i   ve been hustling so hard the past few years  all the talks and articles outside of my day to day job  helps with my visibility credibility in the industry  it makes it easier to show up  because some people already know your name where have you traditionally found your support networks  and where do you find them now my family has always been a huge support  in the tech community i   ve met a lot of friends via irc and twitter  i know that sounds super nerdy  one of my best friends  ines sombra  i knew because of twitter and we met for coffee when i was in the process of moving down to san francisco  there is also a group of people i know from irc channels  where we talked about distributed systems  and since have become friends  i   m really grateful for all of them because i have a really strong network of women and men who are very supportive  who get it  who have my back  and i think that is really important for staying in the tech industry  i do not know how i would do it otherwise how do you think your background and family and support networks and life experiences impact the way that you approach your work my mother has always had a career  a very strong one  she   s currently a director at the us department of transportation right now  and has been cfo at companies  she   s always been managing teams and directors of them  and implementing these big projects  you know  just seeing her out there doing that makes me believe i can  so her career definitely influenced me early on to also want that for myself have you had other specific role models in your life  people that have inspired you i feel like i owe quite a bit to my high school computer science teacher  caroline petite  if she hadn   t encouraged me to take her class  i probably wouldn   t be where i am today  her passion for programming and teaching really inspired me  i still stay in touch with her via twitter it   s great  she   s fantastic of course barbara liskov  one of the greats of distributed systems  and one of only two women to win the turing award  also nancy lynch  she wrote one of the canocical distributed algorithms books  and has done foundational research in the space  just seeing them out there excelling in the space is inspiring to me  i hope i get to meet them one day then there are the women i know more personally who inspire me  camille fournier  ines sombra  jessie frazelle  charity majors  jill wetzler  elaine greenberg  all these women in tech inspire in different ways  and i   m lucky to count them as friends what really excites you about tech right now so i get really excited about academia and industry partnerships  i think we are in a very fortunate time where these key partnerships are starting to happen  because i think we   ve hit the sweet spot where the industry actually faces some of the problems that academia is trying to solve in distributed systems  in the   s and   s when some of the canonical distributed systems papers were written people were still running things on one machine  so it wasn   t as applicable to industry at that point i have been fortunate in my career to work with some wonderful researchers like the orleans team at microsoft research  i also am lucky to get to chat with academics like peter bailis and peter alvaro and pick their brains  and hopefully partner with them sometime in the future what would you like to see change in silicon valley i think hero culture is really harmful  the idea of this one awesome developer who jumps in and saves the day  or founded the entire company  or wrote an open source library all on their own  i get that it   s a good story  but i   m always skeptical when i hear them  because i   m like did they really or is this just the myth we are telling i also think hero culture can be really toxic to teams  it doesn   t foster a collaborative environment  it   s not helping other engineers on your team grow  especially the junior engineers  it also creates single points of failures and bottle necks in your organizations but hey  it   s a good narrative  who doesn   t like a good story where the hero comes in and saves the day  it   s a much easier story to package and sell versus the team of complicated individuals that had to band together to do something where do you see yourself in five or ten years  you   ve mentioned you   ll stay in tech  but what do you think you   ll be up to i   m really indecisive right now about what i want to do next  part of me wants to go and travel and work for a while  in tech we are really lucky that you can find a job that will let you do this and work from wherever you want  and i think that would be an amazing experience long term  i would like to work on more teams where industry and academia are working together  i think i   m particularly strong in that area  i learn very quickly and understand how much tech we need to solve a business problem  i hope to keep doing hardcore distributed systems  i find this area really fascinating  and i don   t think it is going to run out of problems to solve any time soon honestly the answer to this question changes constantly  i guess i just hope i   m always learning and expanding my knowledge  i want to keep sharing what i know  having fun doing it  and feel like i   m working on worthwhile projects that make some positive impact on society whether it   s entertaining people or helping facilitate communication lastly  what advice would you have for women in tech who are hoping to follow in the same kind of path you just have to be stubborn right now  you have to realize that it   s not really fair  and it   s going to be hard  i know you aren   t supposed to say that but it   s the reality of the situation  if you consistently show up  do good work  and find a supportive group of people  you can do well  it may take switching jobs a couple of times  and that   s ok  you don   t owe anyone anything  find a place that   s right for you there   s this great interview with mindy kaling where she talks about confidence  she says    confidence is just entitlement     and that you earn it by you showing up  working hard  and earning your entitlement taylor swift also summed this up well in her acceptance speech at the      grammys saying     but if you just focus on the work and you don   t let those people sidetrack you  someday when you get where you   re going  you   ll look around and you   ll know it was you and the people who love you who put you there and that will be the greatest feeling in the world    so i think that   s the advice  you just have to show up  do really good work  find the people who love and support you  recognize it is probably not fair  and be a little stubborn words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice coman ongoing series documenting
