i   m here to give it to you straight friends  the gritty truth about being an entrepreneur many individuals would gladly sacrifice the       grind for a chance at becoming an entrepreneur  with the promise of becoming your own boss  developing a business of your own creation  and watching it grow and thrive starting wordstream and witnessing it develop from a startup into a truly successful company has been a wild and rewarding experience  but there are definitely some aspects about being an entrepreneur that no one warned me about many misguided individuals believe that if they could only throw off the suffocating shackles of higher education they  too  could create the next apple  dropping out doesn   t make you a millionaire         ask the guy working at taco bell  not that there   s anything wrong with working at taco bell  unless you serve the breakfast menu  in which  best of luck to you soldier  the truth is that neither steve jobs nor bill gates dropped out of school to loaf around and play league of legends all day  steve jobs continued to audit classes for over a year after officially dropping out  he cites a calligraphy class as his inspiration for the beloved mac typefaces and font spacing   and gates had been planning his future software company for some time before leaving harvard they were rare exceptions         chances are you   ll be much better off finishing school before embarking on your entrepreneurial adventure and while we   re at it  einstein didn   t fail math         he was an excellent student and mastered calculus by age     he also married his cousin and never  ever  wore socks  so maybe it   s time to stop using him as the model to base our lives around to simply say that you need to be self motived in order to become a successful entrepreneur is an understatement  you need to be the kind of person who does their taxes in january and flosses twice a day you   ll also need to be authentically curious about the world  with a thirst for solving problems  when you first launch a startup  you   re on your own  eventually you may grow your team and bring great folks onboard to help  but for a while you   ll riding solo  this means you  and only you  are the marketer  the finances coordinator  the pr director  the head of customer service  etc  you will be wearing every hat under the sun as you can imagine  this is basically setting up shop in stress city  usa  however  if you   re self motivated  this can be a fun and exciting learning opportunity  just know that you   ll be playing every instrument in the jazz ensemble  so prepare to be challenged if your business starts to grow and become successful  it can feel fantastic  suddenly you   re seeing big money roll in  and you might get dollar sign eyes  it   s tempting to go on spending sprees  because buying a tesla makes you a superhero  and reward yourself for all of your hard work  the reality is you should be feeding and growing your business with the money it brings in         not treating your business like your personal piggy bank good bootstrapping builds a long term profitable business  so avoid self indulgence and keep yourself on a low salary  besides  your worn out boots look vintage  and you can get all your daily nutrients from ramen   note  you cannot get all your daily nutrients from ramen         but you can try  in school  procrastination is a bad habit  and while it can result in some tough all nighters with a caffeine iv drip  procrastinators still tend to do all right for themselves when you become your own boss  there   s no professor or manager breathing down your neck  you set your own hours and you exchange a suit and tie for sweatpants  jeans if you   re feeling classy   your office space ranges from the starbucks around the block to your dining room table  all this lack of structure is extremely dangerous for procrastinators  who might find themselves watching just one more game of thrones episode before getting back to work  suddenly it   s  pm  you   re ordering chinese food  and you still haven   t brushed your teeth it took some solid commitment for me to start treating my business like a realbusiness         that means keeping real work hours  establishing routines  and sticking to them  this is what allowed me expand my staff and get things rolling  no one   s going to join your team to hang around and watch scrubsreruns  ok  some people might be interested in joining you for that  but you certainly won   t be paying them for it establishing your first startup is immensely exciting  and while you may feel      onboard  it can often be difficult to get others to share your enthusiasm  don   t be too shocked when your friends and colleagues aren   t so keen on joining you on your magical journey into the wondrous world of startups i initially felt pretty discouraged when i couldn   t get friends and coworkers to sign onboard with me and my company of one  couldn   t they see what an exciting opportunity this was  i didn   t understand why no one was willing to drop everything and join me it took me a while to realize that i was asking people to take a huge leap of faith  with families to support and bills to pay  many people weren   t comfortable taking such a big risk  i realized that i had to demonstrate my company   s value to people so that they   d feel more confident that our venture was at least semi reliable i worked on setting and meeting goals  developing my business skills  and putting money back into my business so that i had real results to show potential team members  once i had numbers to back up my claims  i was able to get the team together that i needed the harsh reality is that around     of businesses fail  which doesn   t make for great odds  what   s worse is that as an entrepreneur  your roadblocks become public knowledge as family  friends  and acquaintances continue to ask     so how   s that company of yours going     you can   t imagine how fun thanksgiving is accept that you may fail  but instead of wallowing  learn from your missteps  some entrepreneurs go through several failed startups before finding their golden ticket  it requires a degree of humility to accept education and insight from your mistakes  so check your ego at the door being an entrepreneur can be tough  but the rewards are tremendous  people can tell you how good it feels to see your business win and thrive  but until you see it happen  it   s hard to really comprehend the sheer joy and satisfaction originally posted on search
