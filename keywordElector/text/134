my very recent wife and i have given each other three love affirmations every day for over a year  on our wedding day  our vows reflected that style i appreciate all the small things you do that go unnoticed         the selfless acts for others that need no recognition  like when you smile at a person who is carrying a heavy heart  when you say a prayer for a suffering soul  and the way you anticipate the needs of others  these gems are powerful and moving  yet tender and calm i am continually amazed by how you challenge yourself to grow  you have become more generous with your time  more compassionate with your words  and more loving with your touch         qualities that have inspired me since the start of our journey i overflow with gratitude every time i see you  the strong bond of love that my parents shared is the same love i feel for you  it is a deep love         honest  pure  and otherworldly  i can feel my heart jumping out of my chest just to get closer to yours         longing to beat in unison with the one i love aliyah  i vow to support you and encourage you  love you and care for you  while we grow and develop  from now until eternity  in all the worlds of god product manager   designer   hovercards  instant logos    previously  capitalon
