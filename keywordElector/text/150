cccb    october       the idea of postcapitalism consists of two hypotheses  about the unique effects of information technology first  that information technology is preventing the normal adaptation process  whereby capitalism         as a complex system         reacts to crisis  to the exhaustion of old business models  to the low profitability of old businesses and old sectors second  that information technology makes utopian socialism possible more precisely  information technology makes possible a transition towards relative abundance  through the rapid cheapening of some things  the automation of work  and through highly intelligent utilisation of capacity         of things  raw materials  energy and human services in a short space of time i can only outline the basics         because for this audience         of radical  networked people in a self proclaimed rebel city         i want to propose some rebel actions  achievable at city scale my argument is that information technology changes the economy in three ways first  it dissolves the price mechanism  the economist paul romer pointed out in      that information goods         if they can be copied and pasted infinitely  and used simultaneously without wear and tear         must fall in price under market conditions to a value close to zero whether you use marginalist economics or marxism  the same holds true  the act of copying and pasting takes up energy  mass and some labour  but the amounts are so small that the production cost is negligible of course         and romer anticipated this         capitalism responds by inventing mechanisms that put a price on this zero cost product  monopolies  patents  wto actions against countries that allow copyright theft  predatory practices common among big technology vendors but it means the essential market relationships are no longer organic  they have to be imposed each morning by lawyers and legislators this information effect on price is affecting the physical world not just the world of information goods  just as the price of bandwidth and processing power has fallen exponentially over the past    years  so has the price of dna sequencing  or the number of defects in an engineering process so information is having a dramatic downward impact on the cost of production of real things  and the same vortex of cheapening happens everywhere the second impact of information is to automate work faster than new work can be invented around     of all jobs are susceptible to automation  say frey and osborne         and information does more to transform work  it makes it modular  loosening the link between hours worked and wages  and it makes work possible to do outside the worplace         blurring the division between work and life so falling prices and the automation of work have a very disruptive impact on the normal process of adaptation the typical process of adaptation involves  while old processes are automated and jobs destroyed  new processes are innovated requiring high skilled work  the products command high prices  wages rise in the new sectors  allowing high value consumption  the whole thing meshes together into what carlota perez calls a new techn economic paradigm it   s happened four times in the history of industrial capitalism  the industrial revolution itself  the     s  the belle epoque before      and then the post      boom today it is not happening automation is destroying high value jobs faster than it creates them  the zero price effect fights against the need to raise production costs  neoliberalism has suppressed workers    ability to demand higher wages         and the falling cost of inputs also suppresses this instead of high productivity we have low productivity plus what the anthropologist david graeber calls millions of bullshit jobs         jobs that do not need to exist  like the car wash  which in the space of a lifetime has changed from being typically a machine to typically five men with rags capitalism   s response mechanisms         apart from the imposition of monopolies and monopoly pricing  ara  to maximise capacity utilisation of low skilled labour and of assets  so we get uber  deliveroo and airbnb are effectively capacity utilisation businesses  or b  to artificially inflate the price and profitability of labour inputs  so housing becomes the major thing wages are spent on         and healthcare and university education things that in all previous eras of capitalism the elite desired to be as cheap as possible         to ease wage pressures         are now made as expensive as possible  and capital migrates away from production and from private sector services towards public sector services if we do not break this cycle  you can easily see capitalism being replaced by a stagnant neo feudalism the growth enigine is the central bank  pumping money into the system  and the state  propping up effectively insolvent banks  the typical entrepreneur is the migrant labour exploiter  the innovator someone who invents a way of extracting rent from low wage people         like uber or airbnb fortunately there is a third impact of info tech  it has begun to create organisational and business models where collaboration is more important than price or value i hope everyone here understands the concept of externaltities         for it is crucial  networked busieness models create massive positive externalities         network effects    where the data  or the wellbeing  or the utility created by network interactions is capturable and exploitable but as soon as technology allowed it  we started to create organisations where the postitive effects of networked collaboration were not captured by the market wikipedia is the obvious example  or linux  or increasingly the platform co operatives where peopel are using networks and apps to fight back against the rent seeking business models of firms like uber and airbnb but ask your tech people a more fundamental question  beneath the bonnet of our product  how much of what we use are tools commonly produced  outside the market sector  and maintained for free by a community of technicians  the answer is a lot in the   th century the word for a strike was    taking tools out of the shop     in the   th century the management owned the tools  in the   st century the tools are commonly owned  maintained and free the technology itself is in revolt against the monopolised ownership of intellectual property  and the private capture of externatlities the postcapitalist project is simply  recognise the transition  its enormous potential  and promote it we must stop fantasising about a third industrial revolution  or a third capitalism based on immaterial wealth we must promote the transition to a non capitalist form of economy which unleashes all the suppressed potential of information technology  for productivity  wellbeing and culture i don   t have a programme for this transition but a basic methodology  involving three sectors of the economy  the market  the state and the non market         or collaborative sector         in which things are produced and consumed outside of monetary exchange  where the externalities are collectively owned the strategic aim is  to reduce the amount of work done to the minimum  to move as much as possible of human activity out of the market and state sectors into the collaborative sector  to produce more stuff for free my guess is this will take the best part of a century but there are some things we can do tomorrow to make it happen if the aim is for humanity to do as little work as possible  you can do it through three mechanisms  one is to automate  the other is to reduce the input costs to labour  so that we can survive on less wages and less work  the third is to push forward rapidly the de linking of work and wages i have a strong hunch that the city is going to be the primary venue of change in this process  cities have stopped eviscerating their centres  young  networked people want to live right in the centre         sometimes two or three to a room         because they understand the city is the closest the analog world comes to a network  the city is where the networked individual wants to live         at least for some of their life  and for some of their working year or week so what can a city do to promote the post capitialist transition first         be overt  help people to conceptualise the transition by actually talking about it  the renaissance happened in key cities becaus they set up institutions and a public discourse about the transition  the rialto in venice  as a market  was such a public institution  so was the round theatre in which shakespeare dramatised a story from the rialto  so was the waag  in amsterdam  where goods were weighed i would like to see barcelona become a city where the ideas of co operation  free stuff  non privatisation and overt post capitalism become part of the public discourse next         switch off the great neoliberal privatisation machine we know what it   s there for         to hand public assets to teh private sector so that the profits of decaying businesses are temporarily boosted         whtehr it by a prison controact  a smart city contract  a school maintainance contract another way of understanding privatisation is to say  how can we do public services as expensively as possible you need to end it strategically  that does not mean the local state does everything         it has no expertise in engineering  in hi tech  in transport infrastructure         and must trade with the market sector  but end the transfer the next proposal is more radical  model reality as a complex system planning under socialism had a terrible reputation         the planned economy  nobody wants to return to that  but planning under neoliberal captailism is guesswork  we will look back at infrastrucutre planning in the late   th century as negatively as we do on stalinism   s   year plan we accept ludicrous cost benefit proposals from engineers and architects for the big stuff we spend taxpayers money on     years later  when the infrastructure fails to deliver the promised benefit  there is nobody around to care so we need accurate models  behauvoural  complex system models that we can ask radical questions of  like         what happens if no barcelona city employee can claim expenses for an uber ride  or what happens if we mandate the use of the fairphone  not the iphone if the models says         radical solutions don   t work  and cause more trouble than progress  then you listen to the model but right now we have no way of conceptualising transition         and i would say to barcelona it could  together with some other world cities  sponsor big tech  at scale  to model the urban economy and the measures needed to survive in a long transition next         promote the basic income the basic income is an idea whose time is coming  because there won   t be enough work to go around  for me the basic income is a one off subsidy for automation         to un hook humanity from bullshit job creation and promote hte delinking of work and wages however  it   s a transitional measure  it can only be paid for by the state taxing the market sector  as the market sector shrinks  that means you run out of taxes  so i never use the words    unconditional    or universal  i would make the basic income conditional on engagement with the demos of the city  for example  if you obliged peopel to take part in collective groups to manage the chronic diseases of poverty  mental illness  hypertension  stress  obesity  you could point to a payback from the basic income in terms of current spending next         actively promote the collaborative sector over the market and the state  the building block is the co op  the credit union  the ngo  the non profit company  the peer to peer lender and the purely voluntary or social enterprise most local enterprise models say they want high tech businesses  but they often accept monopoly pricing or massive subsidies to entice monopoly tech businesses  ok fine  but if you only replaced the wasteful creation of low skill  low wage businesses with a preference for businesses with some aspect of collaboration or sharing  you would spark a major change you have to understand the benefits of these entities are not completely measurable in gdp terms you have to promote new ways of measuring activity and progress a simple metric would be  how many hours work is performed for the state  for wages based on taxation   the market  wages paid out of business turnover  including inside a traditional co op or ngo   and how much is provided not for wages at all later on we can try and evolve metrics that capture complex social effects finally  understand and fight the battle over the externalities  whether it is in the roll out of a smart city project  or public health data  or transport planning         the data produced by networks has value to the state  the market and the non market i would not proceed from the absolute principle that    the state owns all the data     or all public data should be held in common  but the state and eventually the commons should have first rights to all the data just the same as in a republic it owns all the land the state should ensire that network data remains anoymous         and that its collection is non detrimental to the human rights of citizens  but then the explotation of the data should be a matter for negotiation  if you need to incentivise the roll out of innovative new city wide data technologies that could promote equality  cheapess and utility for all  maybe you make a deal over the data ultimately  however  the greatest good comes from the common ownership and exploitation of data  because it establishes the principle that this vast new information resource         which is our collaborative behaviour captured as data         is part of the commons suppose barcelona did these things would capitalism collapse no  the desperate  frantic    survival capitalists    would go away         the rip off consultancies  the low wage businesses  the rent extractors but you would attract the most innovative capitalists on earth  and you would make the city vastly more livable for the million plus people who call it home all the other challenges would remain  the environmental challenge         not just low carbon but the preservation of quality living environments in a city sometimes deluged with visitors  also the ageing challenge and the debt challenge the agenda i have outlined is not         and never can be         the sole ownership of the radical left  i think it can provide a common platform for the left  for social democracy and for liberal captialism i think people like me on the radical left were among the first to start talkign about it because the elite of neoliberalism is so bereft of imagination  this is the first elite in capitalist history that reacted to a crisis by doubling down on the model that does not work i don   t think the postcapitalist era will be scarred by competitive empires  as early capitalism was  you will know that genoa came first  to be followed by amsterdam to be followed by london right now  in the world  there are hundreds of towns in freindly competition to become transition towns         avhieveing as close as possible zero carbon footprints and radically changing energy use i could be completely wrong  but if i am right  it makes sense for all cities to ask themselves  could we become the first city to begin a demonstrable and tangible transition away from neoliberal capitalism  towards a society of high equality  high wellbeing  high collaboration if you really don   t like the word post captialist use something else         like the collaborative city  the city of participatory democracy  the networked city  or the human city  but do it author  postcapitalism         a guide to our future
