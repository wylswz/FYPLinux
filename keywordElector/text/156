thi transcript ha been automat gener and may not be accur from the opinion page of wall street journal thi is for an edit now from our studio in new york bret stephen and mari kissel a welcom to form a new shirt i m mari am sorri i wasn t here yesterday wa due to pour so i wa fast yesterday and the synagogu investor broken the fast is the unruli are now back to the broken world and have have been hand to you and we re back to it busi um so all we yemen start with that becaus our good friend the coot s who warnock he tri but a polit movement of shiit who had sinc the end of twenti fourteen had effect control of a larg part of the countri includ the capit of sun on um and are a an extens are a proxi of the islam republ of iran hanif in the past sever day fire i believ five cruis missil chines made see you go to cruis missil among get the point of the second that a number of ship score a direct hit on a new the the a transport ship would sink it and the mean and two american naval vessel the arleigh burk class destroy the uss mason and a in amphibi ship the uss phone with color and a for the post it on of in both case the missil did not get the uss mason wa forc to deploy it ha sent to area defens missil first time ever those missil have been deploy in the real world situat to stop the cruis missil from hit their target it is unclear whether the cruis missil in the master that wa stop by her our defens is i think the sea sparrow missil is a well then the unit state ha retali by fire up a number of of of the cruis missil tomahawk missil and who te radar instal now one of the thing that i think is be miss here he is the idea that thi is our conflict with the boutiqu thi is our conflict with the right there in two thousand and six hezbollah which of cours is an extens of the reign power fire precis the same kind of cruis missil a chines made c e o too at an isra court that actual score a hit on the isra chip although it didn t sink in and lo behold he ran acquir at least sixti of these missil from china in the nineteen nineti there are a fairli sophist technolog i realli call into question the idea that the put s that could obtain them on their own or even fire fire them down there oh i wonder a to grant it the code of an iranian oper there thi is a signific and in a notch or to the medium is play up the signific of it becaus the kid lost in the muck of trump and clinton wikileak and the rest of it but but find tomahawk missil the u s naval vessel is essenti an act of war it is not essenti in the that total are in it did you know what it is it is an activ inact war end and it s just anoth proxi conflict between iran and our alli in thi case saudi arabia and let let s rememb to do that we had special forc in yemen you were driven out of the countri when thi conflict the and so eu a and when he weaken retreat from those posit and instead we decid to help saudi arabia which parti gain in and intel to help them fight thi war against the run back to teas but but to fire directli on the unit state naval vessel to me show the level of the rain aeon s confid and aggress that they can be deepli disturb u here in the unit state and an amount of fat missil hit they show up we would be in a full blown crisi right now right i mean there are some three hundr sailor no more abov board toni burk class destroy like the mason and there are um there can be a mani a five hundr peopl aboard the amphibi ship the size of the polic so um we re talk mediterranean act of war against the unit state which the administr is busili pretend he is just a local conflict have to do with hi bullish of the who these who they have been eager to insist are a connect to he ran a the saudi know is the egyptian no help in which the new york time also parrot let s not forget that line in the stori about it today with a he suggest that some u s intellig offici made the same assert you know that s come directli from the ministri right i mean in noah s remind me of the line intellig is never to be mistaken for intellig of daniel patrick moynihan script line ye the put s are a much a proxi of iran a hizbollah is the proxi of iran and a he said thi wa to signal the raini and confid that they could mount such an oper and expect to be no direct repris against in a direct attack on a us ship now i think there are few point worth make festiv again the yen and a strateg import becaus it strip sit astrid the strait which connect the red sea to the arabian sea which mean that it is vital it is the session the other suez canal it is vital for the abil of ship to cross through the chip that go from europ to asia to to cross the canal without ever have without have to go round the cape of good hope i and so it s econom viabl it s strateg vital not least becaus of the linkag between al kita in a place like yemen and the expans of arcadia across eastern africa in eastern africa in somalia and it proxi like about over there is vital becaus yemen share a border with saudi arabia and saudi arabia worri about the prospect of be encircl by iranian power with syria on one side he ran right across the golf and then suddenli the syrian back an iranian back militia on it southern border which is whi it s it s saudi review ha been conduct thi war ham fist rhiannon my dad and he is such a rum word and um but that they they they think it appear to be a funer um if you are a lot on last sunday kill one hundr and forti mourner but so that s the import of yemen in and of itself it s strateg unimport plate the administr is to read the put it basic pull up stake there when the put s took over in some of them and we realiz they were go to be particularli nice moscow theater control much of the territori it s strateg report also becaus the intellig that we ve been get the saudi in a grudg way ha been in an effort to show re yet to show the kingdom that our allianc is still good despit the euro and the onth there s go to be increas pressur on the administr to pull up stake on on the saudi a a way of assess appeas the coot s into not attack our ship that s that s that s the second reason it s a it s signific that the index i think the most import point out we expect that he ran after the nuclear deal with not we the administr wa gummi moder it s been a fear that it wa go to lead to a new era of cooper those of u will close the deal said on the contrari it s go to super turbocharg iran s region ambit i think i must ve use outlin in editori and column half dozen time walk here it is peopl thi is the rand use chines cruis missil to deliber target in attack american ship and american sailor in one of the most vital waterway of the world and our respons we tomahawk sedan radar instal and let s tri to pretend that we re fight someon other than the islam republ but that wasn t a quick break and we are go to the fact i thi apolog ghost of the potomac watch podcast join me in my colleagu everi week is we dissect all the latest happen in washington and on the campaign trail check thi out and wsj dot com slash podcast and becom a subscrib on iq stitcher spot if i am and who will play music wsj podcast listen ambiti from the opinion page of wall street journal thi is for an edit now from our studio in new york bret stephen and mari kissel one marri soon so we were on the excit topic of the content of american power in them in the middl east but goettel t think the much more upset topic which is the um the collaps in moral polit econom humanitarian of venic with we have now thi week the news that venezuela s suprem court ha given him nicola maduro the communist presid of venezuela the right to essenti approv hi own or or to decid hi own budget without go to the congress for approv the congress is control by the opposit thi wa essenti consolid mother whirl dictatorship and doe so at a period where venezuela ha not doubl tripl digit inflat an economi in freefal a massiv shortag is not just of food but medicin liter starvat in the countri peopl up go over the border to neighbor colombia to get basic foodstuff an incred stori sinc we re get the new york time that spray it from nichola casey leigh a wonder time about former last return ran fourth in a loss to the journal realli a terrif terrif report from about the lack of drug for aam skit afren experiment patient that wa in the studi no pun intend the the the other collaps of thi one wa medic system and not long ago we had john kerri or secretari of state meet presid maduro on the edg of the of the summit in cutback in a sort of gentli prod into mayb except humanitarian aid which mother refus to accept becaus it would suggest that he actual ha a problem um i would submit mari that our venic we love polici of see no evil speak no evil ha been calamit for the peopl it s remark to think about the prioriti of the obama administr in latin america is becaus where did the administr spend most of it energi over the last coupl of year to achiev in a quot quot open to the castro regim in cuba which by the way it serf a essenti the polic forc in the enforc in venezuela keep guy is like that your own and hi drug lawrenc in them and in hi upper action x in power aam and and is you stay in and i ll think it s an overstat to say thi is a complet collaps of of the countri with enorm human suffer and miseri and i fear that it s it s onli go to get wors on one sky is like the duo and chavez for them consolid power in thi manner they they never give up i d i think it s it would be veri difficult to look back through histori for exampl like that and so you can stand all thi is whi i m glad you rais the name of travi becaus aam cha thi of cours die of cancer four year ago i guess maduro wa hi handpick successor but travi wa ardi consolid the dictatorship in venic where love befor hi death let s not forget cold and global laugh my head jeremi core been the leader of the labour parti in great britain naomi klein canada s second most obnoxi person i m from toronto or wherev she s she s base on the global left thrill that the idea of what chines mall repres a populist socialist democrat on them thi wa the guy who who wa the nt guarante who stood in the well of the unit nation um dure hi speech in citi and the odor of sulfur in hi nose becaus georg w bush had spoken there recent and they applaud and applaud what wa a essenti a takeov dictatori takeov in an econom disast for the countri onli disguis for a number of year by that veri high price of oil down all now you have peopl starv and i d realli love to see the global left which is so busi protest outsid of israel emiss were thi or that actual rais the finger to say where did the protest that dictatorship and and and and and the erupt of the venezuelan state for the sake of the busi with brett kenni realli be surpris here we saw exactli the same thing happen with syria on it a we said in previou podcast decid what is laud the front page of magazin and yet when he consolid power and crack down on hi peopl aam win in the refuge crisi start in the human miseri and suffer in almost a half a million peopl dead and million displac um we feel it we we we rare hear about it other than the coffer in geneva and i think that said i think that s an import comparison becaus if the level of econom and social collaps proce which i believ that it will becaus there s no indic that the ador give up power or that the cuban who like have venezuela under their thumb i will will let him do that you re go to see i think a refuge crisi is go to impact neighbor countri like colombia at which is final get it act togeth there on the economi um that is democraci in is the u s alli in thi scene impact countri like that so it s not just a crisi about venezuela thi could becom the bigger crisi about the region you know just a few year ago mayb even a littl more than a year ago presid obama gave an interview he wa ask about a rise global disord nice and while it s not global disord everywher south america is do pretti well anyway now presid obama in the final topic on that topic of the of the day cuz then we can go on and and and say someth posit get readi and a thi incid speak of collaps sterl the pound in and it is now at it lowest level i think in histori i think onc upon a time two hundr year ago you could ve bought on account of the five buck today a it buy you one twenti two when i wa a graduat student in britain would kill for thi exchang that i had no money live hand to mouth it wa one seventi one and that there will will exactli how one six o five so if i were i mean look for shore thi is a veri good time to take my famili in the area of highland scottish vacat we ve alway been talk about on the other hand not such a great deal for the brit despit some claim that a cheaper pound make the dish export more competit debt we have a wonder editori on the beest dot com and i would commend to everyon it titl a pound of worri and it realli take apart thi notion that a currenc devalu is good becaus it s go to boost export and thi is someth that by the way come up and in our presidenti campaign to so it s it s it s worth read not just for for what it say about britain but also to to take that argument by hit nine state of cours the key minardi matter the argument on the left rather is alway well if you have a cheaper currenc it make your good cheaper and and therefor there can be more competit in intern market but feel like much of the left s econom theori that is an oversimplif and it deni the realiti of today to take britain britain is not export in thing like for instanc and in car are see now alm so you know they they they special in good that may not be particularli price sensit thing like for instanc the pharmaceut or the defens industri so it did that get the valu of the pound you may not be a price sensit to those thing becaus you need that for a few separ on a good sitter for export from britain such a they are it may have been report product so if the pound isn t worth that much you re go to pay more rel speak for those input and whether compani can do whether to rais the that that the price to the consum and thirdli of cours thi is alway done the the the second of the popul alway go unment on their saver who s seen in the valu of the pound is is devalu for them they wan na go on vacat for client they can t do that the onli dna it just becaus someon is write a paper and devalu currenc good don t believ them think a littl bit about the idea of those point are well taken and you know anyon who ha grown up insid it in a countri that ha experienc sharp currenc devalu is to know that there s a sliver of the good side and ha a hold pig fat downsid i mean essenti your save your in the valu of your money is be caught you re take that caught in i wa that it wa a child in mexico with the peso one from i think thirti peso to the dollar to twenti six peso than him and ultim forti two then a blend of sweet and a the spell of veri sever inflat and devalu is in the earli eighti and if you were in dollar if you don t have your money and dollar use onli becam an impoverish human be now in the case of you know one of the most import one to mention is yet export becom a littl more competit um but import becom a lot more expens and we live in the global economi where the good stuff that britain is a sensibl export right ha some percentag of foreign input in the compound wa also just the foreign good that you want i mayb you wan na buy wine from franc or you know that that cheesesteak in line with the brit won a violent oh well at the height of the lion offens ha now now threaten them sorri to have to disagre on that one but no not you know it hasn t it ha an upsid becaus um when you are impoverish by a currenc devalu uniqu harder liquor and sing their non uk you can afford french wine and he uniqu start take more scott get well they better hope scott list is conveni if scotland stay with me and i think the larger point here greg s it wa suppos to be that to turn britain into a free market utopia it isn t happen that way theresa may is read it um written on in the direct of margaret thatcher but more the direct of jacqu chirac of of of what kind of will more statist econom model le friendli to immigr le friendli to outsid talent a more interest in state intervent le interest in the regul and tax cut not a good pictur final the what s that it is pretti ok here s the good news but you can disagre with me i am thrill thrill thrill to bob dylan won the nobel prize in literatur i have grown sick of discov that the latest nobl laureat and fairli liter person is almost invari someon i have bare if ever heard of sick of discov that everi nobl laureat ha to be a member of the communist parti is respect for her respect countri when it wa the real fall in in itali or a radic like i will concur in great britain i love the fact that thi nobel
