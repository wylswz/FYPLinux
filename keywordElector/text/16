you want to learn more reason to ungat your content and a few altern solut for those unfamiliar with the term gate content it s simpli a premium content piec such a webinar cours or ebook which life behind a form in other word you must input your inform email phone number etc to get the piec of content gate content is for lack of a better word stupid for a few reason bad gate content is like a man say to a woman at a bar hey i ll buy you thi patron shot if you give me your number then the guy come back with a sugari water down lemon drop which leaf you with a bad hangov think about it for a second how much effort have you put into your gate content offer how sure are you that peopl actual enjoy your content offer you aren t becaus you re measur number of lead and the number of lead ha zero correl to how good the premium content offer is jay acunzo make a great point on content who care if a visitor convert but thought your content suck embarrass which lead me to my next point gate content make me think you re a user a taker that you have a me first mental and i can t stand those type of peopl can you ask for visitor email liter second after they learn about your compani is like a man ask for sex after the first sup it s just plain rude it make peopl uncomfort and it scare visitor away all of which combin make for a terribl first impress and did you know that first impress

though i love the compani a lot everi time i want to download someth from it resourc librari i must re subscrib to the blog which i alway unsubscrib from it s not that i don t like the content it s just i don t want anoth email newslett in my inbox a lot of peopl are like me and download premium content to learn someth not to even think about buy a product especi a high price product like
