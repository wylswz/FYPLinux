i   m in iceland for the term   on sabbatical  with my family  giving my kids a sense of  america  writing tons of law geek stuff   and watching an amazing political battle brew in the upcoming parliamentary elections  october      turns out  democracy has problems everywhere   except that here  an extraordinary citizens movement is doing something about it some background  you   ll remember the financial crisis of       that crisis hit iceland hard  so hard that tens of thousands marched on the parliament banging pots and pans  aka    the pots   pans revolution      and demanding change some linked that crisis to a failure of iceland   s constitution  and they responded to that failure by launching a process to crowdsource a new one  at first  the process was not connected to the government  but then the parliament embraced the movement  and gave it form  a thousand people  randomly selected  would identify the values of the new constitution  then a constitutional council would be elected to draft a constitution based on those values  more than     ran  twenty five were elected  and for four months  they worked to draft a new constitution   in public  posting their version on facebook  and taking comments from around the world  the parliament then put the draft up for a vote  non binding  asking whether there should be a new constitution    based on    the council   s draft   four years ago  more than    ds of those voting approved the draft   blueberry soup is a wonderful documentary about the process  and then  amazingly  parliament did nothing  the bill to adopt a constitution    based on    the draft stalled  everyone  in parliament at least  seemed to forget it but when the panama papers scandal broke  and the prime minister resigned  the people of iceland were reminded that there was still a government to fix  and so an amazing citizens movement in iceland started to develop  to press the issue to the center of these elections i   ve been able to watch this movement unfold  and as a    fix democracy first    sort of democrat  i   ve been watching with great admiration  and a bit of jealousy   the leaders of this movement are all non politicians  there are politician heroes  too  like the birgitta of the pirate party  and katrin jakobsd  ttir of the left greens  but the real activists here are not people running for anything  they are just citizens trying to get a government that knows for whom it works   because after four years of ignoring a referendum  that   s apparently an open question today they launch a social media campaign to frame this election around this issue  the message of the campaign is a clever remake of a familiar meme     can you  as in the parliament  hear us  as in the people  now     four videos  two in english  two in icelandic  will launch setting the terms of the debate  plus the first   of     in icelandic  discussing the top    problems the new constitution will solve  the english versions are below the campaign asks voters            whether on the right or left      to vote only for parties that commit    to making the ratification of a new constitution based on the draft of the constitutional council a priority in the next parliament     so far  the four key opposition parties have made that commitment         the pirate party  left green  social democrats  and the bright future party  there   s a great chance those four will constitute a majority in the new parliament if this movement takes off  it has a powerful potential   in iceland and internationally  the icelandic constitution society  which is running the campaign  has promised to spend the money they raise on rallying iceland to this cause  but anything raised beyond what   s necessary will go to democracy work internationally  imagine the frame of this campaign         can you hear us   applied to democracies globally   i   ve already reserved canyouhearus us  my favorite line from the longer of their ads     while we are local  democracy is global  let   s show them what that means    let   s  if you can help  please do  spread the videos  spread the message  donate if you can  this could be a rare victory for democracy reform this election cycle   and one that could inspire many elsewhere it   s already gotten me law professor  activist
