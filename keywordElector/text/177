thi transcript ha been automat gener and may not be accur i from the opinion page of the wall street journal thi is potomac watch is now the aisl polici down and calmli well come unemploy you go out with the wall street run opinion page and i m here with my colleagu jame freeman that good morn jane hall and jewelri good to have you both here with thi talk about the the presid s like a campaign today talk about tom truck money money issu newark loan outstand by quit a bit in key battleground state some of the travel of their rang suggest that the candid arrang suggest the tenor of the the the race and wa move in and the senat that s move against the republican it would appear on time or talk a littl bit about that let s start with the that that raw money joe the new stori broke broke that the trump is no longer becom campaign is no longer go to do ani big money fundrais here in the last two week of the campaign which ha been rais some i have a lot of money for car oper for the rnc campaign walk that back a bit today say well donald trump is no longer go to lead these showcas these fundrais but there are still in a rais some money but there are the larger stori here joe is they re be apprais and help to area you know i think discern extent thi stori ha been overblown by the report tori clinton her last big money and then in in florida on monday night so thi is not unusu for a campaign what s unusu is that hillari clinton and her event ha rais about five hundr million donald trump ha rais about two hundr million see you would think he would he would be work overtim to rais more money in particular becaus he a he ha no infrastructur for lack of a better word himself and is reli entir on the rnc the republican nation committe for turnout oper for get out the vote and so come off thi big it realli put the rnc in spin someth of a blind eye to that the the crucial final stretch yellen dead team of the money that you have suggest donald trump to expand break to check out the big check here just doesn t seem to be forthcom no i think that start it will be a fake arm an ironi of thi elect if he end the balloon i think it although so much a time ha been spent on say thi are talk about hi mistak and charact flaw and ms statement and and certainli a those break it did it to be realli about the money and the turnout oper they are they get strike given that the medium s been pronounc and dentistri both for sever week and and beyond the pale an and an unaccept he keep show strength among independ voter in the number of poll if you just took an abund of would be closer much closer than the averag of poll it might even be ahead so jame had ever met ronni ran away with the independ boe and still lost anymor than independ to peopl to win the elect absolut but my argument though is that if the premis of so much of thi report is that hi statement that made him beyond the pale isn t it odd he s run so well among independ who have no partisan tire there s a zero p a will there s a certain appeal that messag when i what i focu on is is is is what i guess i don t think it s too strong a word to call a malpractic couldn t be told them that the candid the nomine of major parti human oblig to put all your resourc possibl to win the elect and trump promis primari voter republican that he would do you didn t need to rais big money from him from big money donor becaus he will financ the campaign himself he is in financ the campaign himself unit he said of money mike took the nomin the report at least a hundr million of it own money in in in in to the campaign re now that s a sixti seven million so he ha in the the the the billionair is often fill with some promis on on that front a lot of just bizarr spend choic locat on the campaign in trump tower they re pay more per squar foot by a factor for even the crime campaign is pay for their warehous in brooklyn so to see that not onli doe he have fewer resourc but he s not deploy them in the most effici way go ahead and wa consid those good and we were talk last week about thi so moment in the debat where they were both ask if they would accept the result of the i think thi thi will be a factor in a phone it s a veri close elect becaus oracl and ha spent a lot more money despit what she said in that debat she ha spent a lot more money deploy peopl on the ground all over the countri readi to contest the result if she want to go that rout also relat to thi is so the campaign that run campaign deploy mike penni the vice presidenti nomine to drumrol pleas utah mani peopl think that s the most republican state heavili mormon um but on thi campaign it said donald trump is neck and neck with kevin mcmullan the and that the mormon a candid who wa run a third parti oper not in everi state is on a few state do well in utah and i don t well enough in utah but he could win some electro photoshoot make an ego state elector vote which would make him the first third parti candid to win elector vote sinc nineteen sixti eight when georg wallac didn t southern state so comedian ross perot one nineteen percent of the nation popular wrote in one a singl state so that would be done at a particular humili for top note it would be bad and mean it if you look at the poll about forti percent of utah voter are still undecid up up up up is i don t see them go heavili for for for for hillari clinton now and that that s the most out of ani state it s it s highli unusu two week befor the elect of that now thirteen day befor the elect to to have that kind of result of you could realli start to see a lot of surpris there mike penni go up there on the same day trumpet is open hi old post offic hotel in washington d c open to pick up those district of columbia elector vote and jame say that thi trend well run over the medium cover all fifti state so when you get on nation program so i am not sure of that skin of the of the total loser for him uh go to be see if he get some coverag i think it is a nice contrast between hi hi busi career which ha had it up and down but actual exist in the real economi versu the way the coin of gun wealthi which is polit influenc but to a far a utah i don t see him lose that a big obvious he s done and said mani thing that the can offend peopl of faith the mormon in particular but i think ultim like most other republican they d look at the fact in the real wa the the the clinton ministr is go to wage a non stop war against the thing they believ in while trump is a is a flaw guy with with somon well i mean sick you know certainli flaw but dove but is not go to do that i don t i don t see mcmullan go anywher in twenti sixteen while he s in a mainli in utah which is not nowher but that it obvious doesn t get him to the white hous it is imposs to tri elect world map with meme on take the time i know neither height nor time get to two seven he answer and wrote that that would be fun and i would love to see that but i don t think that thi year i think that s just an outsid chanc tschogl of the money made from mit make a wineri i know you do to join you i m just teas that but what i wa the one i want to me wa in respons to jame is the jame s point is the republican will come home when they see that the altern is just wrong and climb and the rethink about that the damag that declin presid who would do to republican principl ok but it ha to be close enough for peopl to think of all matter and if it it look like in all the poll it s gon na be a rout and i think a law to republican but sometim they are among of all my conscienc and and i just can t vote for donald trump and i could compound the magnitud of hi defeat to and includ a state like it what a terribl decis that would be becaus here you would be base it on some poll you d have to ignor other becaus ye mayb what we ll find out who wa wildli off certainli mani of the poll are wildli off the line to differ becaus they re so differ that someon is greet mani peopl are theori wrong about where the lectur elector is right now so you have to make an assumpt that the that the poll that show her with a big leader the actor want and then you find out after you vote to whether or not those peopl do what they were talk about um but the the gener i think safe assumpt is here throw your vote away it s they can make it to make you feel good did right in your friend or your rel or evan mcmullan um but you have to realiz in vienna they you have a job to do thi is realli not about make you feel good is david tortur is note you need to help u opec presid and were down to two basic aren t let let s let s take a break and we come back for top ten of the senat race and how those are break here in the late go and also talk about some of the latest in which these leak discov it s when we come on veronica dagher atlanta retir it s how that you can listen to the lock your love podcast you get there for more affirm tech is that it the beest dot com le podcast by the sun nineteen stitcher and now spot wsj s ye within ambiti from the opinion page of the wall street journal thi is the helmet law now we are call to go and car welcom back to impos ago here with jame freeman joe rego and i think befor you for growth show you want to get him and the answer for the freeman here on the question i think that the oblig of voter to vote for either donald trump or what yet i mean i d i guess some i don t realli see it is an oblig i mean that s you you you can vote for whoever you want i think jame is right that it s either go to be trump or claim except in an extrem unlik if potenti plausibl scenario the the other porno it may come the poll is what what we seen thi year it is that gener all the poll are cluster around a on five six seven eight point lead for clinton and then you ve got a small cluster of al miner track eleven when it to basic within the margin and that you know that the ration thing to do is use go with the the broad trend or for the averag but i guess which is point out that in twenti fourteen we saw the same thing where there were there wa a big trend and then u the outlier and it happen to the alli were right and republican swept sand well and and and dental and so on it it is possibl it s possibl when the poll we ve seen we seen in recent poll let s of them it s a worldwid phenomenon we ve seen we saw in tv and in in the isra elect bibi netanyahu uphold high did better than the paus we saw the tori are do better in their elect sweep a coupl a year ago no more than a year ago on the tv camera did veri veri well better than the poll we saw brock said he wa about ten if you know four to six eight point swing ag depend on the pole he elect day were prep up so and we also saw in twenti fourteen your point to one in twenti twelv it wa the opposit of the poll had met ronni do better than he actual did on elect day so the poll can be wrong but men in thi case it doe seem to me is that there s a if you look at the averag five six percentag point advantag for klein the behavior of the campaign themselv valid that leav becaus they re show up in state to campaign that suggest the claim hasn t been she s put away virginia keryx trump is scrambl in florida and north carolina told hi own with no state henc dispatch to utah clayton primu put it away in pennsylvania and new hampshir those are that s the behavior of candid to suggest the claim doe have a pretti nice pretti solid lead in the poll certainli the clean campaign is is act veri confid but some woman in the obama trump campaign on act veri hard but you know thi is whi we actual play the basketbal game instead of just go on what the odd maker predict will happen right so right i d i can i can sometim hear the half court shot trip it s been one of everi thirti or forti if they did it go off the beit borden ian not much mileag point out that the poll in synch the chronicl about it and avoid motiv reason and i d use to the other point is that the charm campaign ha spent more on hat and poll so it could be the i d get to their own well respond to their own intern data there s not much of that it s a of it s also worth note most peopl of the vote in yet it s still two week of pole are a snapshot in time now the the um again i guess there s a sens now a we head toward the end the final stretch here that now they have kind of solidifi into thi five or six point one lead but if you look at the last year it is a graph with a lot of volatil it is not a straight line so i do think it s also a mistak to assum that two week out thi five or six point lead on averag if it exist is the wave go in the two week from joann expend all that money and have to go to town campaign spent some time on the ralli cap becaus i think they re basic can be put on thi ralli cap befor it if there are no african woman s select and ye that s right now but jame excel truck if so let s go to let s go to the center race which are which right now which have been movi nm are still mani veri veri close but coupl of them have been move against the republican nevada been move against the republican are tri to compar abt their new hampshir poll suggest kill iot is increasingli in troubl miseri and north carolina much more competit than republican thought they would be to the point where those could go down and of cours pennsylvania is still in wisconsin in on all your heart will consum is veri competit in illinoi and and wisconsin still republican still trail in those although ron johnson of wisconsin is do better than mani peopl thought what better actual and that race continu continu to close the the these race are quit doe while pull it intern most of them are tossup i ve that the thing work get republican re now is that histor when when you re the spa separ is probabl three quarter of them all break the same way they didn t break with the nation presid had that happen for republican in twenti fourteen and so what what republican are realli worri about new seen mitch mcconnel skorup which is run by steve wa pump twenti five million in in to advertis and in the last two week of the campaign they re they re they re worri that the that nation atmospher is is just couldn t drag them down too much and even if they run ahead of the top of that a kid gold will get wipe out of it charm lose by law to be on their inner be outspent if the by the figur that curti twenti five million unit in the final go to other make a big effort to tri to rais some last minut money to be abl to be competit becaus a we know some last minut ad if unansw can be a real problem in all just point to two year ago in virginia and gillespi wa so ran out of money he wa gain in virginia on the mark warner he wa so pull in close the republican senatori campaign committe given him zero help but he just ran out to cash them anyway miller s own pocketbook to tri to financ it there wasn t enough and he could ve pick up that brace at the end if they had put in enough money given thi is realli a uniqu race thi year becaus when we talk about nation trend were talk about me in term of headwind for republican here talk about money and you re talk about trial the big head wind for democrat or the economi obamacar most peopl think the countri on the wrong track most peopl not like hillari clinton um gener thi is the moment when peopl would be turn when you look at histori would be turn to the other parti after the democrat of control the white hous for eight year ye you you would think that chang so i know i m not sure there s the way eu of public sentiment build i think it is certainli when you have the money disadvantag that s a big concern it s a problem but it s i think a display problem it is not on top of some larger public dissatisfact if ani thing that s drive the other way here s what i pick up though and it relat to turn around and more and more a lot of republican nomin say a singl singl out by the so call while counti walk a show of be one of them the at around milwauke the end of the the the republican base there is not motiv to come for the endeavor trumka wa unbeaten pretti soundli by cruz and that discount and primari credit and that critic in the southeast from one the northwest of the state but not the southeast and those are the big republican turnout count the suburban milwauke counti s that s where scott work with select scott walker that s what elect when ron johnson six year ani if if if republican gon na win that senat seat he had a big turn out there so ron johnson s task is to say ok euro whallon who went to marquett univers and disgust by a trial in you don t want to vote for trump you still got ta get up go to the vote booth becaus the center race manner that stuff and i m hear that the republican are pour money into the get out the vote effort in those counti and they just are find through their pull some thought someon would demor pace he i mean i think i think that s one race where they might come through me and in you might see a lot more ticket split among the wisconsin republican and it s a highli organ they they know who the voter are on the day and potenti get them to the poll i d i would i would actual give ron johnson and mayb of the abov you know shark or shot in that race precis for that reason we believ it gon na turn out in those counti show becaus of the week in wisconsin thi up from green bay down through walk over to the west to short of of of madison we gon na have to be turn over to overcom downtown walk downtown racin demand and also let s not forget there is the other scenario that mayb they decid that if they re disgust with trump that while they don t like it it s on palat they re disgust by hilari more amanda them end up break for car fan but some possibl and that s the ad campaign are go to start to see which is don t give hillari clinton a blank check of the the the the question is though that tend to when they tri that in nineteen eighti six and work with of gold dole sanction that effort to go for guy who don t crump the end of campaign against it befor befor thi is over and that could be problemat yet mean i d i don t think that s been go i don t think it s go to work a a polit matter and i think it harm the long term futur of the republican parti if you can flame on the tension between some of the faction with that with that and it s readi to impress me meet rout to india will it be if the rnc besid we ve we ve got ta put all our money into into congress and all these candid from realli aggress look killer can win unlik me is that a a check it it it might make the divis within the republican parti a lot wors than they would put it that way joy think milano pick a new more subtl than that but if it is not a subtl your ball well but i mean you can say the dough to give don t give the presid the now blank check or don t give a liber plu presid blank check it s you know thi would be lower or you could use a hillari clinton would you abc she must cheney s or republican congress to stop the idea i guess i m still resist thi idea that of the trump is go to crush them and it s sort of figur out everi candid for him self out or respond down the ticket way i think the the next week will probabl tell u a lot in term of the poll where he had a lot of alleg dump on them some of the more credibl than other he did not respond well voter now have a chanc to digest that and wait against all of the coin in histori that they know i can see a tighten is speak of that histori to finish up today wan na talk about the wiki leak e mail the cheryl mail sent to john podesta both kline after a brock obama said in an interview that he first found out about hillari clinton s privat email oper through the news medium just like the rest of u she sent an e mail to protest the same carol mill did say we have to clean thi up he ha he ha e mail from her meani lakeland and they re not from state to go now of mine reaction to thi wa when you use the word clean thi up i wa the parti kind kalin pulp fiction a a cleaner go to clean up the wolf come in to clean up the mast and in that s what basic it alway is with the clan yen to bring in the clean the a they re all career ha ban he won cleaner after now and you wonder wa wa cheryl mill just sit there with the coffe when i went on our summer but he wa rub the server thi is whi i think peopl reflect on it you have here and now now the presid is intuit make a guess is a question for him it s possibl that someon e mail you you don t studi the address you we know about what if you decid to add that person your contact for a new phone instead of them e mail you you were the first email them you probabl would notic that it wa whitney mail dot com if i m rememb correctli a oppos to state dot dove soap i think that is a question but but the overarch stori which they are tri to cover up in mani mani way is that hillari clinton violat the rule on public document and endang nation secur in order to move her commun off the grid so that peopl would not see the connect to her famili s foundat and how that intersect with state farm of busi and sid blumenth among other fine he american and so much els that she doe not want the public to see so that thi sort of realli corrupt at the heart of her and her husband s busi model i d i think is whi i wouldn t count from yet the eye against it the auxiliari point to make is that the presenc email address is classifi onli a few peopl have that inform for for reason of encrypt and nation secur on the fact that hillari clinton is use her privat homebrew server to email him at that address potenti compromis hi hi own account and pay for it just underscor a reckless thi thi entir oper want ia and an extend for four year despit brief after brief that she and her aid had about the danger of hacker and and and put two and put him in secur at all to be fair killer clinton told the fbi she did not recal receiv ani of that time the idea i know that but she did issu under her on a a a the depart whi aid aam memo say pleas be extra care with your secur becaus becaus were under sieg here now i when i send out a grant you guy probabl don t when i send out stuff like memo you guy probabl ignor them but i don t ignor i rememb what it s and thi might be a test let s let s not forget she publish a map or describ all of the secur procedur are the onli one they would do to avoid compromis inform when they were especi when they were travel oversea i know it said thi is thi is thi is for it remark stuff but the american public is get a smile to me and thi inform to make of their own mind so i think you all for listen will be back later in the week with anoth anoth edit of potomac watch
