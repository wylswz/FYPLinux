hi there  we   re point nine capital a vc firm focused on saas and marketplaces  if you want to be kept informed of our new posts you can subscribe to our content newsletter or follow our medium channel as a vc firm focused on both saas and marketplaces  we have not only witnessed the rise of the    saas enabled marketplace    hybrid model  sem in the rest of the post  but also invested in several of them  docplanner  eversports  deskbookers  styleseat  xeneta  infakt   through our deal flow and our deep dives we encounter many of these startups in a variety of verticals and industries  this is why we wanted to share an overview of this fragmented landscape and make our approach transparent from our point of view  a saas enabled marketplace is a business which combines the characteristics of both models this    methodology    has been popularly described as    come for the tool  stay for the network     by chris dixon and sems are in the perfect position to embrace such an approach saas enabled marketplaces can be b b  b c or c c and the saas component can be offered to the demand or   and to the supply side whether it   s a business or a consumer these companies also combine the business models of marketplace and saas as they can monetize the transaction through a fee or the saas component through a subscription  mathias modeled the different options in the following diagram when we set ourselves the goal of mapping out the sem landscape  we first and foremost embraced the process and the exercise  it was clear from the start that we couldn   t come up with an exhaustive list of all existing players in every vertical  our main aim with this post is to give the community a first overview of the main sem verticals and players  as well as sharing some lessons we have learned we   re planning to update our map in the months to come  in the meantime if you want to get on our radar just fill out this form in addition to the map here are some findings that we wanted to share with you  please feel free to add your own thoughts in the comment section below         we   d love to read them a first observation we made while mapping this ecosystem is that there are   scenarios when it comes to saas enabled marketplaces these scenarios reflect really well the maturity of the overall tech ecosystem  as people and businesses are increasingly used to working with saas and to buying   selling goods or services on marketplaces the line between the two models is blurring and many products integrate both another interesting finding is that for some verticals it was extremely easy to find saas enabled marketplaces while for some others it was very challenging in general  we found more players in verticals that were already mature in terms of pure marketplace and saas players  allow us to clarify that point with some examples for instance  we had no problem finding sems for the    travel   tourism    or for the    professional services    verticals  if you want to book a flight  a hotel or want to find a plumber there   s a high chance that you   ll first search online  and this search will probably lead you to a comparison engine  a booking marketplace or an online listing in these instances going online and browsing listings has become a habit for both users and professionals  there   s no market education to be done the more mature a vertical has become  the more competitive it gets and the more pressure there is for suppliers to perform well  in such environments the saas enabled marketplace model very often emerges to help them perform better for example many of the sems we   ve listed in the two verticals mentioned above offer professionals not only plenty of features to manage their bookings  from simple calendars to complete booking systems  but also marketing features with ranking optimization  dynamic pricing  yield management  off  and on platform promotion etc  and even crm or invoicing features  providing just an online listing is not enough  established marketplace operators must provide additional added value through a saas component at the other end of the spectrum some industries  like agriculture or construction  haven   t  yet  reached the same level of maturity and we couldn   t discover as many saas enabled marketplaces to that end  the sem model seems like a natural evolution of the marketplace and saas models which are    merging    their strengths into the same product on our map you   ll find every type of sem possible  b b  b c and c c  concerning the saas component there are   main aspects that we want to highlight the first point seems obvious  the non professional users of these marketplaces generally don   t need         or want         to use a software tool to manage the transaction  in the vast majority of the cases they just want to buy something as fast as possible a notable exception to this situation is when these consumers are on the    supply    side of the marketplace  the first    c    of c c marketplaces   then they need saas features to manage the good or service they sell  for example livementor is an education platform that enables anybody to give online classes and hence offer a tool  in parallel of their marketplace  that helps tutors better manage their activity which leads us to the second aspect         in most cases the saas features we identified were built for the    supply    side of the marketplace for use cases like  to conclude on the saas component aspect it   s worth noting that vertical sems are  obviously  more deeply integrated compared to horizontal sems  ex  yardbook  a sems for landscaping businesses  has specific features which are useful only for this particular type of business as we   ve seen above some verticals are more crowded in terms of saas enabled marketplaces than others  but  when we were exploring these verticals we could notice that many of them had very interesting and fast growing new segments this is  for example  the case for the real estate vertical  in this category you   ll find plenty of large  well funded players  zillow  opendoor     but at the same time there are plenty of startups which are innovating on growing use cases like b b short term rental of retail spaces  flash retailing  this shows us that even in crowded verticals there are still plenty of opportunities to deploy saas enabled marketplaces  which we would love to hear from   international early stage vc out of berlin
