this essay asks difficult questions and challenges assumptions about progressivism  which may upset some people  it also ventures into areas in which i am ignorant  please forgive any errors  rest assured that i am not trying to promulgate bigotry or supremacy from the perspective of the establishment         and my demographics place me firmly in the establishment         many historical and contemporary minorities are fighting essentially the same struggle  black or gay  woman or trans  progressivism always seeks to better a minority group  this group has been oppressed compared to  and often by  an established group  straight  white  male  rich  able bodied   but the consequences of this definition are far from simple  i see individuals across movements who would agree  and those within the same movement who disagree  i have found that many of these positions lie on a spectrum from assimilation to isolation there was perhaps no champion of minorities greater the dr  martin luther king  jr   he   s definitely on the assimilation side    judged not by the color of their skin         because in a colorblind world  there can be no discrimination  no hate born of fear born of separation  only love  his vision was of harmony and equality secured by shared humanity and trust  he understood that violence and revenge were counter productive i won   t call malcolm x an isolationist  his views were more nuanced and varied throughout his life  but you can certainly find quotes to that extent unlike dr  king  malcolm x could never let go of his rage against his oppressors  he was keenly aware that american prosperity was built on centuries of black suffering  he sought black advancement as restitution for a debt  or a crime  he never wanted black to assimilate into white  because it would lose its status as the victim two people  fighting the same struggle  came to different conclusions on how their minority group should relate to the establishment  both of these men were intellectuals who wrote books on their position  so single words can only crudely approximate their ideas more recent advocacy fits onto the assimilation isolation spectrum much more cleanly  in the age of soundbites and tweets  we seem to have lost a lot of the thoughtful depth of the civil rights movement the most direct articulation of assimilation i   ve ever heard comes from the contemporary comedian liz feldman without any linguistic qualifiers  marriage makes gayness or straightness indistinguishable and irrelevant  assimilated groups are hard to discriminate against  but without that language as a marker  the group can lose its unique identity what about the trans movement  you might think of famous trans individuals  or the pansexual nonbinary genderpunk otherkin of tumblr who seem to distance themselves as far as possible from conventional sexuality just because they can  but there are more mature voices in the trans community  like ivan coyote the short version  we should install gender neutral single stall bathrooms in all public places  the crux of the argument is accessibility  the required assumption is that trans is no more a choice than paralysis  so therefore bathrooms should accommodate transfolk just as they already accommodate the physically handicapped indeed  the lens of accessibility can also illuminate marriage equality  gayness is seen as a biological condition         not an illness  not a disability         but physiological rather than cultural in nature  being gay makes one man one women marriage inaccessible  so  just like putting braille on room number placards  or installing ramps next to stairs  the government has regulated marriage to be accessible to more people it bears repeating that the enemy of accessibility is choice  society is not ethically required to accommodate the outcomes of free will gallaudet university in washington  dc is a school for the deaf and hard of hearing  derrick behm is part of the office of campus design and planning  through a translator  he signs he doesn   t explain what those perspectives are  so let   s switch from deaf to blind and consider stevie wonder  the accessibility argument holds that some fraction of people can be musicians  some fraction of people will be blind  and that when these overlap  blindness should not inhibit people like wonder from becoming a musician  the other theory goes further  claiming that blindness actually contributes to wonder   s success  by somehow giving him knowledge or an ability no sighted person has this is the essence of pluralism  diversity contributes to a stronger whole  there is room in society for all of us  but it is still ultimately one society  togetherness  but not uniformity when a group tries to set themselves even further apart  well  snl captured it pretty well the voice  the fashion  the hair  the pride flag on the door         are these mainstays of gayness  or merely stereotypes  is this educating yourself in human diversity and cultural sensitivity  or merely a lewd caricature of course  this example is an exaggerated farce  as oversaturated as the brightest pride flag  but it   s not without its kernel of truth  that   s why it   s funny  gayness has expressed itself outside the bedroom this befuddles the assimilationist  who asks  why does sexual orientation matter in space  nasa doesn   t allow astronauts to join the     mile high club  if gay is this noticeable  then how could they hope to be part of    normal    society  isolationism and exclusion seem to be the rational response but perhaps gay culture  as it developed in the late   s and   s  was a response to isolation  not the other way around  to be flaming was to defy the bigots who wanted you to disappear  in the face of oppression  a culture validated the gay experience  and elevated it from vulgar sex drive to something more intellectual  it let the gay community find each other  for support and for dating  that is  gay culture         arguably         arose from the social implications of being gay  not directly from the biology  as those social conditions change  what should become of the culture they created one thing is clear  and that is that trans is not necessarily a more extreme form of gay  gay can still try to distinguish itself  trans can want desperately to blend in is today   s urban black culture legitimate  does it deserve our respect  despite how it shuns education  glorifies drug use  and sexualizes women  did it arise organically out of african traditions  musical styles  and worldviews  does it matter   to what extent is it a product of the living conditions forced upon the black community         cramped urban spaces  low income jobs  poor education  little access to health care  and has the white community been complicit in creating these toxic ideas  and then feeding them back to the black community  for a price  do rap and ebonics convey the black experience  and a white person has no business saying otherwise when the black community co opted the n word into a positive greeting  they acknowledge and highlight the centuries of hate that they have suffered  i   ve heard president obama derided as an oreo         black on the outside  white on the inside  it   s insinuated that being educated and articulate is a uniquely white experience  or that poverty in the    hood is a quintessentially black one  contrast with  blacklivesmatter  a desperate plea to simply be acknowledged as human we   ve tried on a lot of ideological hats  and it   s not expected that they all strike your fancy  some of these hats are perennially fashionable  others are the current fad  some are ugly  and still others are utilitarian helmets this is an essay about diversity  not only the diversity of the human body  but also the human mind and its opinions on those demographics and cultural groups i see progressives fight each other because they prefer slightly different approaches to responding to oppression  it   s worrying  because it defers progress by drawing resources away from fighting bigots and bigotry  it   s also tiresome  because many of these disagreements have already been fought over  just pertaining to a different minority group  ultimately  all forms of response have virtues and downsides i hope that  by seeing many examples across many minorities  you can better appreciate how many progressive opinions fall on a spectrum from assimilation to isolation  when you read a progressive blog or hear a speech at a rally  you will be able to fit it into the spectrum to better compare it with other opinions that you are aware of thinks too much  knows too little  and wants to save the world
