around in elect a wall street now i see here is veronica dagher look into watch your welt presidenti elect seri on veronica dagher such a thing a an attorney with palli drop than welcom the show i think you will michel beat ani idea or speak about today may chang in with the support of congress that kennedi becam presid so when i laid that out first and befor we get into the propos i would like u to just chat briefli about some of the exist situat in the u s deficit unpaid leav for exampl give u a snapshot what is the current state of paid famili leav in the unit state right now that we have been paid famili leav and no requir to provid ani aid be current i am though if a famili wa here have child the fact that determin whether they are and where author ani paid leav or if they will have to see it that that they can take off in the veri fine to care for new trial now you would say nasti the us is the onli develop nation that doe not provid some form of p famili in the defend to in ye i mean consid how develop the are we are realli not you know that in perspect the countri in germani proprietor the euro on paid leav and you were fight for weak of these thing on that also meant that the famili medic leav so where doe thi come and what it say that for that trait that that famili medic leav act i while we are in pain free and it did not appli to everyon though it onli appli to player that have fifti employe or more and a lot of malt that the fed which would heal yet the fact that we take it off are not requir to provid the templat thingi the fed all eat it you know it would cut off hi child inde on top of the pictur thank alot sam s can not afford that risk off on and so busi are requir to cover and then a you said famili need to put that money on around you know you have chosen to use the censu of the child care cost your scene yet there he and i have two child one in three and me to be on the lower incom famili and the have a care in the washington d c area and a pervert the virginia and i can t are at a non profit and for all that they can get over forti thousand dollar for your though it is a huge fan and a screen and i know that not all peopl can get that that that would and he did a lot of peopl that they have famili that are abl to it can offer you new parent are tire it can lead to a capella the six dimens say it s a stagger amount of money and short even more perhap in newark citi in decemb to california it s just a big chunk of chang what is clincher propos when it come to you famili and then it had been up that fall we have a bit famili and be in aam the word in it to happen on have a tough but it cut out the pepper and or famili member that well in the twelv week that it can realli think if i do both karen o and a mother and father would be abl to take that leav a or mother mother in effect a coupl to have a child in it would all help refin it i or or parent who can not actual it that they can run but are stop be or have a child through her to be how should propos to pay for past that is on the air at that point i see that that should that be the wealthiest american pay their fair share and for what they can not further the howl that think that with that now it is to say that thi propos peel even did happen on the path to get your congress person while she did get elect so thi is on a lot of hit on youtub but that would replac the famili medic leav act or with that stay in place and that would turn of the on mayb peopl leav the famili medic leav would stick attack on the piano kealey versu all just too specul at thi point op ed opec note that i would imagin that if she got up and that he can be had it could impact on the famili medic beat back becaus that famili and other thing that appl veri fear of it you know the clinton propos will provid you with a peep but the question is what will you be requir to i for turn in confess or will you the peopl to the nuclear play appeal in and get anoth posit right now half an hour late onli that that if you take twelv week on a clean and your employ onli requir you to maintain a posit a fairli steep effici prior to have the time i m not realli sure exactli how that you would get there but certainli not that i think that cover applic speak of congress tell like congress s to go for u well it into thing both parti are propos ep though perhap it will final catch on in these type of list her cousin i think that a new mother s chicken or will be elig for a week that he is the in the paint that it would be paid for through on a plain shirt say and not pay anyth with regard to adopt or thirti foot or new author so i m unclear on how those father to be name the dead benefit or just not part of thi packag potenti track and and in term of pay for that that that that someth that peopl would paint eu a they were right with the unemploy insur that you wear our take part he read on how we are pray that you provid enough on bodi in which to cover that it be that it be it s so cute all thi uncertainti in the differ propos out there what step can famili tea on just that creepier for differ conting though i know i m a millenni are have babi and that you know there s not much that they can get their intend effect immedi becaus they can t reli on ani of these are power but in the interim there are coupl that that be taken educ your style of play the card you whether it can onli appli if the first half on and on the new candid to collect and the top of their penetr to make sure that there can actual get to the propos and is anoth there is perhap the paint disabl insur the paladin share an interest ackman is consid that the stabil and so if you purchas it though in turn if you re elig for it then you can potenti k into the insur for exampl in a bikini ticket levi on befor you can read the detail and when peopl think that for ten month there are longer than a punt give birth he should be elig for keep him on a payout which could potenti cut for the week end to the insur some addit amount the hope of that i m not cori spink so much for join u now i think it meant thank again to kill you are men s nation team and for join u thi isn t watch
