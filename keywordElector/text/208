the young women in the photos sport pained expressions  one might say they look horrified  as though they ve just witnessed intolerable cruelty  some unimaginable act of violence  alas  no such horrors have they witnessed just the musical stylings of four mop top british boys         the beatles these girls are the face of beatlemania  and they are not distraught  they are excruciatingly overjoyed  this is the quintessential squee of a fangirl unsurprisingly  the term    fan    is a simple derivative of the more intense and negatively connotated fanatic  psychologically speaking  the act of fangirling is qualitative  neurologically speaking  it   s quantitative  we can  in either case  easily identify the behaviors associated with the moniker  with the advent of medical imaging technology we can see the brain frenzy right along with the audible squeals and shakes that overcome young women confronted with their muse  fangirling is very real  but the question is a more esoteric one than that  where did this come from  who were the very first fangirls i m tempted to suppose that  at least in human history  fangirling goes back to jesus of nazareth  i don   t say this with any hint of heresy or facetiousness toward christianity  i m entirely serious when i venture that the followers of jesus   his groupies or fanbase  as it were   no doubt experienced what we would call contemporary fandom devotion  what is a fandom if not a devout following  in his legacy of do gooding  jesus won his way into the hearts of millions  and has continued to have the largest fanbase of any historical figure         real or fictional  love of jesus is not dissimilar to one   s love of frank sinatra or  in contemporary times  the nubile one direction  it   s not love in the typical sense but rather  a synonym for idealized worship at the most basic level  fangirling as a verb is replete with the usual feminine tropes  crying  screaming  squealing  jumping up and down fervently  a bedroom full of posters and memorabilia  the penning of fan mail  lusting for an autograph or a lock of hair  the true nature of participating in a fandom  and truly being a fangirl  rests not on these worn out tropes  but in the fledgling community that is built around a particular individual or character in the interest of science  i took it upon myself to delve deeply into a fandom to further explore the psychology behind    the fangirl     this was a pleasurable task and one that i admit  in the interest of full disclosure  was not something i could be entirely impartial about before there was tumblr  or any other number of online communities  there were a few rudimentary geocities pages and fanfiction net  as a preteen i was a venerable x files fangirl  and having had this experience in the late      s and early     s  i must say i am envious of the fandoms today that have  at their fingertips  beautifully curated fan communities as much as i would have loved to re enter the x files fandom  i rightly assumed it would prove too distracting  i would have been so deeply sucked in  reverting to preteen behavior and all  that i would accomplish nothing  so  i chose instead a more contemporary fandom  one that did not have a prehistoric internet presence like the x files fandom does  i chose a fandom i would enjoy         making the task completable         and one that would also be most likely to reflect my own demographic  caucasian  middle class females  ages           i needed to be able to assimilate effortlessly  lest my cover be blown as with any fandom  there is a glossary of terms one must know in order to navigate one   s way through the forums  a great deal of the terminology evolved from fanfiction  which in and of itself deserves a proper explanation  while it is often accused of being shameless plagiarism  the construction of fanfiction is intended to be more along the lines of steal like an artist and follows the rules intently  fanfiction is created to improve and explore an existing concept  not rework it with the intention of profiting  it   s meant to be celebratory  appreciative  entertaining  it often explores characters in various settings that are not seen in the show            canonized            and drills down into their respective psychologies  throughout my perusal of downton abbey fanfiction  i was astounded by the quality of the writing  while fanfiction in other fandoms might get a bad rap  i   m here to tell you that over the last six weeks i read fanfiction that was on par with several heavily lauded novels i read this year an otp is a relationship         canonized or not         between two characters that is a particular fan   s all time favorite of any possible pairings  within the downton abbey fandom  there are requisite brangelina style portmanteaus for such couples  cora and robert     cobert     the earl and countess of grantham are married   anna and mr  bates      banna     got married during the course of the series  and butler carson and housekeeper mrs  hughes  charles and elsie  giving you    chelsie      who   ve had a long  smoldering  friendship turned flirtation that many in the fandom desperately hope will become canon a good majority of the fangirling  fanfiction  fanvids and fanart are dedicated to one   s otp  this  of course  leads to the conversation of    smutty    fanfiction  i e  fanfiction that includes sexual sequences  some of which can be gratuitously graphic at times  that being said  the most popular fanfiction isn   t necessarily pornographic  but rather  what is most true to the characters         which  particularly in the case of the downton abbey fandom  is an important consideration  given the time period there is also    slash    fic  which would include pairings of same sex couples that are not canon         in the downton abbey fandom  a popular slash pairing is between the countess of grantham  cora  and her lady   s maid from the first few seasons  sarah o   brien  these are also often part of au  or alternate universe  fics aus are particularly important playgrounds for those within the fandom  allowing them to challenge character   s psyches in situations that         while they may never be canon         can help reveal aspects of the character that have been suggested  but never deeply probed  this seems to happen quite a bit in downton abbey because it is a period piece that depicts life in an era where people were not often         if ever         forthcoming about their emotions  least of all in aristocratic england as a writer who is rarely free to work on anything fictional  i admit i enjoyed the brief foray into the crafting of fanfiction  the downton abbey fandom in particular seems to be filled with well read young writers who  in addition to creating their own well constructed pieces  are capable of providing effective criticism and critiques  many even serve as    beta readers    for one another while the fics are being written  assuring that the final product is of the best quality  it was  much to my chagrin  a rather humbling experience to realize my limitations as a writer  but freeing due to the relative anonymity tasking myself with delving deeply into the world of fangirls was exceptionally easy thanks to tumblr  i   ve been a fan of the site since my late high school days and have amassed over        posts on my tumblr  which  in fight club style  we re never going to talk about   using tumblr as a means to explore fandoms  which are easily tracked by the use of tags  made the investigative portion of this exploration almost laughably easy  fangirls are exceptionally organized  the tagging system is not only easy to follow  but can at times also provide commentary which was often the highlight of the post  it was on tumblr that i was able to really get to know the breadth and depth of the downton abbey fandom  which encompasses people from around the world and is not necessarily limited to the    middle class white girl    demographic i envisioned there were all the requisite blogs dedication to role playing  fuckyeah blogs for each of the actors  countless urls that included either character   s names  variations on them  or quotes and quips from the show itself  posts ran the gamut from fanart  gifsets  episode recaps  which were often very astute and witty   links to interviews with the cast  text posts discussing plot points  character development and  of course  otps  i found the fandom to be particularly friendly  encouraging  and welcoming  i don   t know if this is a sentiment that can be generalized to all fandoms  but i would like to think so  what a fandom achieves in uniting people from all corners of the world over a shared interest is admirable  and something that one would hope is as inclusive         in its exclusivity         as it can be what did wear me down         and gave me an impetus to make my exit before i became too present within the fandom to leave unnoticed         was the sheer size of the fandom  it was easy to be sucked into  and somewhat alarmingly difficult to extricate one   s self from regardless of the time of day  there was always something to reblog  to comment on  to share  to look at  to watch  to read         it could be  and often did become  overwhelming  perhaps i am just too old  too easily overstimulated  but in the end there was a certain anxiety about being a devotee of the fandom that did         unreasonably so  i think         cause me a bit of angst my suspicion is that this is not at all unique to the downton abbey fandom  and i doubt it would have mattered what fandom i chose  the very definition of a fandom reflects this intensity one of the hallmarks of fangirling is information mining  it was this aspect of my investigative fangirling that i found came the most naturally to me  as i am at best a magpie of knowledge and at worst  a textbook hoarder  avarice  intellectual gluttony  is my vice  suitable to the art of fangirling the focus of one   s fangirling         whether it be a real person or a fictional one         is characterized by the conspicuous reality of never really knowing the person you have acquired such an interest in  either because they are famous or only exist in literature or film  in lieu of personal knowledge  a fangirl  equipped with the marvel of the internet  seeks to know even the most mundane of details  it breeds a sense of intimacy if your eyebrow has risen at the implication of nearing stalker territory  i empathize  at first  i wondered if that was a common theme within fandoms in general  i found that it   s the exception         not the rule         to the idolization of individuals by fans  generally speaking  it   s harmless infatuation  fandoms are not a breeding ground for john hinckley jrs in truth  it is the act of amassing such details         and discussing them         that breeds the intimacy  but not between the fan and the fangirl  rather  between the fangirls themselves  who are bound together by their curiosity for this otherwise meaningless knowledge  in their shared appreciation and celebration  they begin to form friendships  soon they are not just remembering and celebrating the fawned after   s birthday  but one another   s  they connect over shared otps  make fanart for one another         knowing each individual   s favorite au  perhaps  they write fanfiction that is tailored to individuals in the community  everyone knows who writes the best smut  who loves to serve up angst  who creates original characters     ocs     and carries them through an entire series of fics  called    a mary sue    these characters sometimes         but not always         allow the fangirl herself to enter the world   for some  i imagine  fandoms are the only place to feel truly known and appreciated  perhaps that   s why they are so difficult to leave i would be lying if i said i had not stepped back into the fandom since i officially ended my research  i still read fics that captivated me  as downton abbey has started airing in the u s   i can relive the past couple of months as i watched the new season  in real time  when it aired in the uk  thanks internet   some of my favorite memories are now recirculating on blogs and forums to keep pace with the americans who are just seeing the drama unfold  i   m enjoying seeing the reactions of american journalists who are tasked with recapping the episodes  i have contributed my requisite discussions  there is a part of me  though  that feels a bit smug  somehow i feel as though i know this show         the characters         more intimately than the average viewer i feel almost self righteous in my supposed knowledge of the internal motivations  the relationships  and the back stories  things that are by no means necessarily canon         at least not yet         but that have become part of my personal    headcanon    because of my participation in the fandom i recall  at one point  positing to the fandom that one of the reasons i gravitated toward the housekeeper   s character         a middle aged  unmarried  scottish woman with a heart of gold and a rather unusual habit of lip biting  a trademark behavior that is the subject of fics in and of itself  is because while she has no children  she sort of plays    mum    to all the young maids and footmen  she   s stern  means business  and isn   t at all gratuitously affectionate   but she is calm  level headed  and kind  she is  and in fact the creator of the show has attested to this  the moral heartbeat of the show  i can only assume that because of my lack of a maternal force in my life  i gravitate towards people  or characters  who exude a particular maternal essence  not necessarily the most flowery expression of motherhood  either  but the calm and steady presence of someone who you could believe would always be there for you this sentiment was deeply considered  and i appreciated that even if people within the fandom didn   t have the same experience  after all  some people just love the character of thomas barrow  for instance  because he   s hot and deliciously indulgent in debauchery   they respected and validated my own musings that  really  was what i took away from the experience  when you strip away the acronyms  the smutty fanfic  the collages  wall sized posters  and red faced screaming mimis at beatles concerts  being a part of fandom is a deeper calling if you like what you just read  please hit the green    recommend    button below so that others might stumble upon this essay  for more essays like this  scroll
