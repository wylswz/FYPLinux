on april    i put myself to a new challenge  it was one of the biggest life hacks i   ve ever done the challenge was simple  waking up    consecutive workdays at      a m   a challenge i gave the name of    earlydays  i was already used to waking up early    a m  almost every day   but this time i wanted to go further  i wanted to test myself and be more aware of my own limits  and at the same time  my idea was to share my progress with the world and try to change some preconceived ideas that society obliges us to follow i chose to only do the challenge on workdays because i knew that weekends and holidays are radically different for me  there are times that i work even on these days  but most of the time i have other plans that include going out at night  yes  i could do the challenge every day  but i thought that it   s a question of balance in life  as my idea since day   was to continue even after the    days  this would be more a struggle than a true benefit and why    days  well  i based it on the old idea of dr  maxwell maltz that says you need    days to form a new habit  not necessarily true for many habits   i didn   t know if it   d work  but for me it was more for the sake of establishing a goal  one lesson i always apply to life is to always establish a goal when you want to change or reach something because only in this way will you understand if you succeeded or failed but what was the final goal in all this  it   s all about productivity and making the most of my days  i   m always thinking of ways to improve my work and my life and i like to think about details and take action if i think i could improve  i   ve known for a long time that i am a morning person  and so the goal was to increase my morning time to see if it would increase my productivity so  what have i learned from this  a lot    if you want to change something in your life  it   s always better if you have support along the way  it will be this support that keeps you on track when you   re about to give up  in my case  i opted to share my journey on facebook with my friends and acquaintances  i knew that i would need this because if no one knew i was doing this  no one would hold me accountable for failing  but when you share your journey  people will ask you how it   s going  whether they agree or not  and in my head  i could not give up and show weakness  i doubt i would disappoint anyone because this isn   t such an important thing  but if i could inspire at least one person in the end  i couldn   t give up for that person    people like to see different things  and someone waking up so early is definitely not a normal thing  so i had huge engagement in my posts  people concerned about me  people asking a lot of questions  and people stating that this would be impossible for them  i had great and deep conversations because of my posts and i couldn   t be more thankful to everyone that interacted with me  you made me think about many things  and part of this post is also a result of these conversations    people don   t wake up earlier because they think they have to sleep less  in the first days  some people were really concerned about me  most of questions were about only one thing  the time i sleep  of course i had this well planned  i know very well what my body demands and as i changed the time when i wake up  i changed the time i go to bed too  simple  usually i sleep between   and   hours during the week and i maintained exactly that during the    earlydays  so when it   s      or    p m   it   s time to go to bed  to my surprise  the majority of the people that asked me the time i sleep  sleep less than me  and me  in fact  i   m sleeping even more now than before    eliminate the obstacles along the way  people always say that doing something like this is impossible for them  yes  there are a few situations that can make it harder  but i also believe that many people just don   t want to go the extra mile to improve their lives  society in general is lazy and many people go with the flow  yes  i have some conditions that helped me do this  i   m single with no children and i have complete control over my daily routine  but i have most of these things because i created this situation  when i lived with my parents  this would have been way more difficult because i had the context of the family environment  so  i started this challenge when i knew i   d extinguished many of the struggles along the way  think of everything that   s getting you down and preventing you from reaching that goal you   ve wanted but have never achieved  this is applicable to stopping smoking  going to the gym or eating more fruits and vegetables  getting rid of your obstacles makes it easier to achieve your final goal  in my case  i knew that i   d need several things  total independence in my life  i e   over my working hours or dinnertime  the ability to go to bed anytime i want and to not be interrupted during my sleep  and the ability of working anywhere and anytime i want  i have all of this  i usually work in startups  which means that i have huge flexibility in my time and that   s why i can be working at      a m  this flexibility also allows me to come back home earlier  in addition  no one depends on me and i   m not dependent on anyone  and despite living with   other people in a shared house  i reach sleep easily at such an early hour    your physical condition helps a lot  regarding sleeping  i   m clearly a fortunate guy      i fall asleep really fast    min on average   i sleep well  rarely wake up during the night  and anywhere if needed  and i have no problems waking up  when the alarm rings  i get out of bed instantly   of course  this is also a consequence of my lifestyle  i eat well  i practice sports every day and i don   t have big and permanent worries in my life  but even given this  i believe that there are many people that could improve their sleeping  it   s always about changing little things  and after a few weeks or months  you   ll feel the impact of all those little changes  i   m at this point as a result of years understanding how my body behaves and what i could improve  i didn   t change yesterday    forget snooze  fortunately  i rarely used such thing in my life and these    earlydays only help to convince me of the uselessness of it  for me  snooze is one of the worst inventions ever and it doesn   t help people  if you want to wake up at a certain hour  please do and don   t delay it for    minutes  one simple snooze will seriously affect your day         studies show that you   ll be even more tired after sleeping that    minutes and this makes people delay several other things  nothing good comes of snooze    i like to sleep  but my body only needs   or   hours  after that  i don   t take any special pleasure in being in bed and i prefer to go out and do the interesting things that exist in the world  because when i die  i   ll have a lot of time to sleep        more working hours  since i started waking up at      a m   i won   hours of work per day  how  as i said  i   m a morning person and after   p m   i don   t do anything valuable  even my afternoons are less productive   so  with this hack i took out   unproductive hours of my night  when i usually was on my laptop passing time  and i won   hours  when i get lots of work done  a rested mind and   hours of complete silence while the rest the world is still sleeping are extremely powerful and make miracles    i get messages out of the way  usually  during these   hours  i answer all my emails and messages and plan the rest of the day  having an    inbox zero    at      a m  is great but the best part for me is the fact that i have no instant answer to my emails and messages  especially on facebook  this is something that can destroy your productivity  as it   s perfectly possible for you to spend all day chatting with people  and if you think twice  you   ll see that the majority of people don   t need an urgent answer and nothing bad happens if you wait to answer them tomorrow     more time at the gym  before these    earlydays i was already going to the gym  but since i started waking up at      a m   i   m going more times per week  before    times was already good  but now i can   t live without going at least   or   times  i truly believe that the fact i wake up earlier helps this as i don   t go to the gym so tired and when i go  i have already worked   hours  this helps in those days when you think you don   t have time to exercise     a new view on the world  waking up so early allowed me to see details around me that i   ve never seen before  going running while the sun is rising or exploring different places in lisbon during unexpected hours were impossible things with a    normal schedule        yes  you need the will to do it  if you don   t have it  no one will have it for you and it   s highly likely that you   ll give up  otherwise  if you have the will  no one will stop you if you enjoyed this piece  you might also like marketing manager  prodsmart  established
