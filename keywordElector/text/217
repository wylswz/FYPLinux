  march            a m  it was early on a saturday morning and i was taking a train from porto to lisbon  i was going to spend the day in the capital of portugal  it wasn   t to spend a vacation weekend with friends  to go to a football match or to watch a live concert  it was to spend an entire day at a conference about youth entrepreneurship  that conference was go youth conference and it was its first edition at that time  i was working at my first company ever  doing a valuable internship for my future  but it was also boring  i knew that working at that kind of company  huge and bureaucratic  would never be a fit for me  and so i was already trying to find new paths for my professional future  one of the things that i did regularly was go to conferences and meet new people  especially conferences about entrepreneurship and startups  i started seeing that the people participating in those kinds of conferences were different from the rest of the world     ambitious  fearless and full of dreams  and i felt connected to those people i had seen something about go youth conference two or three weeks before while browsing randomly on facebook  and it captured my attention immediately  it had a good concept  some interesting speakers and the promise of a lot of young people gathered  eager to change things and create impact in portugal and in the world  my decision was easy  i bought a ticket for the conference the day was fantastic  but not because of the reasons i pointed out before  yes  i met new people and i learnt from many of the speakers  but the most important moment for me was when i met the organizing team for the first time  i remember it like it was yesterday  i was between surprised and shocked  why  because they did an awesome job organizing everything and there were just five of them  aged between    and     i thought that those guys must have something special and i started building a relationship with them that has lasted until today months later  tiago vidal  the lead organizer  went to porto where i was living and we had the opportunity to know each other better  we had a lot of ideas in common and i knew that  one day  i would do something with him  a few weeks later he invited me to join the team of go youth conference and the rest is history go youth conference became a huge annual event about youth entrepreneurship where we connected young founders and ceos of american and european startups  investors and journalists with a young audience  mainly college students and recent graduates  i have been part of the last two editions  being an active member of the team as the community and partnerships manager  but doing a lot more things  as does everyone on the team  go youth conference grew massively  reaching outstanding results but more than numbers  what makes me grateful for being part of this adventure is all the good things that have happened in my life  go youth conference literally changed my life forever  and for the better  thanks to go youth conference i dropped out of a master   s course that i didn   t like  thanks to gyc i worked for two awesome companies  vertty and getsocial   places where i developed my skills as never before  where i worked with some of the most talented people i have ever met and where i found my inner talent and how i could sell it to the market  interesting fact  i met the founders of getsocial  at that time wishareit  for the first time during the startup competition organized by us at go youth conference  i ended up working with them for eight months a few months later   thanks to gyc i met a lot more people from the startup scene in portugal  especially in lisbon  and that was crucial to be working now at startup lisboa  basically  many of my future working experiences and the loads of new people that i met along the way  many of them who i consider my friends today  are thanks being part of go youth conference  can i imagine my life without all these good things  not at all i   m also very happy for the friendships i   ve created with each of the members of our team  it was almost two years working with them and many moments will remain forever  we had bad moments  of course  but also a lot of incredible moments  telma  andr    gon  alo  hugo and s  lvia  the last three from the      edition   thank you for everything  i   m sure all of you will have a brilliant future ahead of you  and especially tiago  thank you very much  thank you for trusting in me to join the team and for changing my life  i really hope to work with you again one day  and please  continue doing the best conference about youth entrepreneurship this world has ever seen doing something like go youth conference is terribly grievous  you have to renounce many things and dedicate much of your time  and after this  you also have to know how to organize such a thing because  i guarantee you  this is far from being easy  because of this  i always say that i   m really proud of us organizing gyc and not others  because others would never do so well as we did gyc offered me a feeling that i   ve never felt before  the feeling of changing many people   s lives  if you   ve felt this before  you understand what i   m saying  if you   ve never felt it  please try it at least once in your life  it   s the best feeling in the world and pays literally everything    we have not been able to manage to find ways to make go youth conference sustainable enough to pay all the team to be completely dedicated  i believe that this will be possible one day  but in europe  especially in portugal  this process is very slow and the dimension and distance to the big markets of the country doesn   t help  so  all the team always were working or studying at the same time  for me it was always possible  and desirable  to do several things at the same time  but now i believe that  in order to deliver the best job i can do  i must be completely focused on one project  that project is now something else  and it   s what pays me nowadays to live    moreover  the commitment of the team to the project must be      in order for everything run well  organizing an annual event obliges preparation of months before and  consequently  your commitment must also be on the long term  my life at this moment doesn   t allow me to commit to something that will only happen months after    i confess  i insanely love and hate  at the same time  to organize events  i hate the weeks before where everything is still to be done and everything is wrong  and i just love when everything is happening and receiving all the feedback in the days after  probably i   ll organize more conferences in the future  as big or even bigger than go youth conference  but now i need a little rest from it for the record  if money wasn   t part of the equation  i   d love to be part of go youth conference      of the time and help it grow every day  having direct impact on hundreds of people   s lives  filling at the same time an empty space on the educational path of some countries regarding teaching entrepreneurship to young generations  seems to me a great plan of a fulfilling career today  i say goodbye to go youth conference  it was a hell of ride which i   m really proud of and i   ll never regret it  but now it   s time to move on and dedicate myself to other challenges today i can say  it was my way  and that feels fuckin    awesome        www filipecastromatos com   medium   twittmarketing manager  prodsmart  established
