there   s a disconnect between the questions most angel investors ask and the questions they really want to ask  it   s not that they   re afraid to ask these questions  it   s that they   ve either been programmed to look at startups as they look at public market companies or they simply don   t want to step on people   s toes and hurt any feelings  i see this happen all of the time while some angels won   t invest unless you have a product  a detailed go to market strategy and a killer team  most won   t invest if there are problems with the following areas  even if you hit the nail on the head with all of the traditional questions so what do early stage angel investors really want to know  this is my take the number one thing people care about when dealing with other people is integrity  this is reiterated by every single angel investor i   ve ever spoken to  are you honest  will you take my money and go play poker in vegas  and the fedex payroll story is something to inspire  not imitate   will you spend       of my money on dinner with your family and         of my money on a personal vacation  angels want to sit down with you in the same room and feel deep down in their guts that you   re honest  when they ask you about you they   re really asking    am i going to have legal trouble because of you  or worse yet  am i going to feel embarrassed for having you on my team because you stole from employees and lied to clients and now i have egg on my face by association    most investors who are honest with themselves know they can   t evaluate your idea because they   re not in your space and they   re not as smart as you in the given vertical  airbnb  facebook  tesla  instagram  uber         all ideas turned away by thousands of investors who put themselves in the unfortunate position of evaluating the idea  i can   t for the love of me evaluate your idea  i usually have no clue  i can however evaluate your process and your team and see if the idea was the result of a workflow i deem sensible or if you came up with it beause that   s what all the cool kids are doing now  jason calacanis wrote about this recently  this is where deep domain experience comes into play and something brad feld calls founder market fit most angel investors  especially the self aware ones  know they   re not in a position to evaluate your product because again  the biggest plays aren   t obvious  what they want to know is can your team get something to market  they want to know what you   ve worked on specifically and how instrumental you were in delivering that product to market  you product doesn   t matter at this stage because products change all of the time  people and teams pivot  but can you get a product that people can use and pay for to market how do you spend your time  i don   t really care about all of the details but i want to know the general schedule you follow  if i personally believe this business requires    hours a day and you   re working   hour days or you take   weeks of vacation and countless long weekends and are consulting and involved in    different things then you   re probably not focused so you   re not giving it your all  if you have integrity      you   ll give it your all do you know what cac is and ltv is and can you picture your unit economics so that you don   t sell a product it takes      to make for      a lot of startup founders fail at this  a lot more than we   d all like to admit  so can you wrap your head around your own projections  angels know that none of this will hold up as you sell and scale  but they want to understand how you think are you guys going to have founder drama  more than half of all startups fail because the teams don   t want to continue working together so make me believe that you guys are going to make it through   to   years of total hell     hour days in total stress   days a week and then a   pm flight on sunday afternoon to des moines   yes  there are exceptions         teams have known each other for a month before they founded  but you need to understand the risks how do i know you won   t self implode when the going gets tough  what makes you think you can work    hour weeks at the age of     will you pack things up in year   when we   re just getting started so that you can cash out at    mm and leave me hanging   thingsthatdavidcohenisafraidof   show me that my        year window is aligned with the next decade of your life do i like you  because if i like you maybe others will like you and they   ll want to spend time in a room with you  which is important to raise money  hire people  get press  sell stuff  etc   if you haven   t built a startup but you   ve build a charity or a department and people will kill themselves to work for you or at least move cross country to work with you then you have a chance of getting the best to work with you are you going to yc demo day and i   m going to get in  will i meet elon  will i get into some more amazing deals  will loic le meur write about me on that startup ship  how is this going to help my current investments succeed  will my dad be more or less proud of me  is he finally going to see that i   m a winner whatever it might be  you need to recognize that investors are guided by self interest and make sure you answer their questions with a strong vision and a good   honest story this is what early stage investors  pre product  pre traction  pre market  are really asking  figure out how to signal these   things and you can raise without a product  without users and without bs if you   d like to chat further about vetting startups email jakub at  email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript
