today i gave closing remarks at an atlantic council event titled    the illiberal turn   reasserting democratic values in central and eastern europe     below are some thoughts following the event these are challenging times  sometimes turbulent times  in many parts of the world  yet we focused at this event on central and eastern europe for good reason this region has been a military theatre too many times in our history  and not so very long ago  it   s also been a theatre in the battle of ideas  producing some of modern democracy   s greatest and most hopeful advances throughout the conference  we heard from sharp minds and experienced hands about the challenges confronting liberal democracy in this region we heard about leaders feeling the temptations of authoritarianism  especially as economic pressures unsettle their citizenry we heard of the citizenry  especially those left behind in global economic trends  who might be tempted to loosen hard fought rights in the name of national stability or personal security most urgently  we heard of russia   s methodical program to undermine democracy by exploiting doubts  widening cracks and sowing the seeds of disinformation to be clear  it   s not that moscow seeks to overturn democracy through its front door  but rather it looks to weaken it from within it   s not that moscow seeks to take over the countries of central and eastern europe  but rather to prevent their democratic and economic success more than anything else  we know the kremlin fears the advance of liberal democracy in its neighbourhood because that challenges the very underpinnings of it ruthless grip on power three decades ago  president reagan  standing before the british parliament  called for a    campaign to assist democracy    in the face of aggression from the east several years later  president george hw bush  standing with helmut kohl in mainz  germany  warned us all that    democracy   s journey east    would not be easy today  what these leaders expressed  optimism tempered by a realistic assessment of authoritarian threats must be harnessed once again by the community of democracies this is the basis for iri   s beacon project  working to build political alliances that push back against this threat we do this by examining russia   s disinformation and propaganda techniques  and working with allies to forge strategies to reinforce voices of freedom and liberty in the region now  most europeans do not appreciate it when americans try to tell them what to do  my parents are european  so i know of what i speak but please allow me a friendly suggestion here  i urge the eu to see the destabilizing danger posed by russia more comprehensively this is not a problem that can be addressed alone by the governments affected         nor can it be addressed solely by governments of individual member states it must be addressed at both the national and eu levels through increased support of institutions that have the mandate to support and strengthen democracy currently  it is mainly us donors         particularly the national endowment for democracy         supporting various anti disinformation initiatives in the eu and eu neighborhood         the balkans and the eastern partnership countries there is simply no doubt that we need all our friends and democratic allies to expand their efforts with us in this field but diagnosing disinformation is not enough         we must also support political parties to implement policies to push back against disinformation strong civil society is important  but is not enough  we need to have strong and viable political structures to allow for a stable political system we believe this is something american organizations should work on more closely with our european partners  such as the german foundations and partners in the united kingdom  scandinavia and the netherlands we also need to be more innovative and think more creatively about how we can use social media in support of democracy and political discourse why do we need to do these things  because anti establishment and anti globalization sentiments are real and growing people feel they have little control over their own political affairs  they feel that the link between the people and their government is broken we need to pay attention to these sentiments and help our citizens understand how they can constructively         and democratically         influence not only their local but also global affairs unfortunately  today many in central and eastern europe seem to believe the only way to influence is through populist and radical movements we must work together         comprehensively         to constrict the influence of these groups by showing a better way the time seems short  but there really is still time         if we pull together  plan together and stand together         with our important democratic allies in central and eastern europe president of  iriglobal  former president   ceo of  igdleaders  u s  ambassador to tanzania           member of congress
