this june we will be married for    years  we had arranged marriage  for those of you who are alien to the concept  it   s where more or less parents decide bride groom for you   in these    years  we have been through quite many bumpy rides and have picked up some important lessons  i have tried to use these lessons effectively when i am building teams for living   trust is where it all begins and ends  corner stone in any relationship is trust  it   s amazing how people rise up to occasion  when you show that you trust them and their judgement  trust enables you to build long lasting relation with anyone beyond just work based interactions listening is what needed more than anything  sometime offering solutions to the problems is worse you can do  all that is needed in marriage is art of listening it is same with team or clients  i must admit  i was bad listener but as time has progressed i listen more than need  this enables me to recollect my thoughts and also get fresh perspective on what other person has to say  i have been able to defuse many volatile and tense situation simply i emphasized on listenunder commit and over deliver  i learnt in very beginning of marriage over committing things ends up being disappointment for both the parties  people always pleasantly surprised when they get more than what they were expecting  this is key to having happier partner or team members or client   kill the ego  it   s no good in relationship  ego happens to be bad it prevents us from accepting that we might be wrong  this causes prolonged bitterness in relationship  if you set aside ego  it becomes easy to see mistake and seek sorry for the same and life moves on  in work also if you remove ego  you are happier more productive and you can think more constructive    it takes    i me    out of equation allowing    we    to flourish   it   s give and take marriage or work it   s give and take  you concede some and you win some  this has helped me quite lot in last couple of years  it   s not always    all or nothing    game  you must be prepared to give some to gain some  if client or team member is stuck on something that is important you and to them    finding way to middle ground saves you lot of time effort and hassles   marriage has taught me quite many lessons that has helped in my work life  biggest thing that i have learnt is you always have time when you make time for something
