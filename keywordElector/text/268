attended the white house   s national day of civic hacking  inspired by what he   d learned there  mike returned to san francisco and founded  freespace   an organization that focuses on sustainability and urban tactical development  in the spring of       mike went to greece where he spent four months rehabilitating an abandoned clothing factory in the industrial sector of thessaloniki  turning it into a humane shelter that he and his colleagues named elpida  unlike the official migrant camps in greece  where refugees have little say in the day to day operations of the camp  elpida put its     residents in charge  and the results were remarkable  not only is elpida much less expensive to run on a per person basis than official camps in greece  the residents don   t suffer from boredom  restlessness  and disengagement like they do at ngo run camps as a pilot model  elpida offers hope and improved living conditions for refugees in a place where no other ngo was able to provide in this kind of support mike has been working with institute for the future as an affiliate since      and recently accepted an iftf fellowship to help uncover and study new paradigms for restoring vulnerable places and space  such as post disaster sites  informal refugee settlements  and decaying urban neighborhoods i spoke to mike about his work at elpida in august        just days after he returned from greece how did elpida get started the idea for elpida was by amed khan  who spent the last year and a half or so in greece observing the migrant crisis  he foresaw that there was going to be this lack of suitable housing and camps set up for the migrants that were there  so he had the idea of trying to use private philanthropy and working with either cities or the church or the government to try and set up a space that meets the humanitarian standards tell me about the refugee situation before elpida it   s been a really dynamic situation over the last year or so  starting with a tremendous amount of flow             o to       people a day arriving in boats from turkey to the greek islands  that was a situation that no one was really prepared for  and the migrants didn   t have the destination of greece in mind  they mostly were heading to germany  greece was just an entry point to the eu over a million passed through greece  but back in february  macedonia shut their border and built a large fence and the military patrolled it  essentially  you have this backup of people who were heading to germany and got stopped at the border  they formed a camp called idomeni  it was a village of about    people  and all of a sudden  you had        migrants there waiting for the border to open  this was a really big challenge for the ngos  for the migrants themselves  for greece  and it really highlighted this transformation of the eu being opened borders and to making a big change in the whole dynamics of the eu greece   s government is really cash strapped  so what were they able to do you have this situation of the people arriving on boats to the greek islands  and making their way to europe  and then getting stopped to idomeni  about a month and a half ago  the government made a decision that they were going to close all of the informal camps  that included at the border of idomeni  but there were also several camps around northern greece  close to the border at gas stations  at hotels  as well as at the port piraeus in athens  and so the government declared that they were going to close these and relocate people to official camps  this all transpired in the several months that i was over there  essentially  the solution for putting or for housing the migrants was to rent these warehouses and factories  and essentially just put military tents inside that   s where the majority of people were relocated and the unhcr has audited these camps and they   ve said if they don   t meet minimum standards  the cdc equivalent  the center for disease control of greece has gone in to these camps and said that three quarters of them need to close because they   re spreading communicable diseases  that   s the current state right now in the end of august  that we still have a tremendous amount of people housed in substandard conditions  the funding for this  as greece   s government is cash strapped  they have been relying on ngos  and also funding from the european union  there   s a batch of funding called the    eco funding     eco that heads out to both ngos and to the greek ministry of defense  a lot of the labor and the materials are being sourced by the greek military what is the quality like in the official housing to be honest  it   s substandard  there   s infrastructure wise lack of hot water  lack of water at many times  the toilets are chemical toilets  portapotties  the migrants typically prefer the turkish style toilets  the squat toilets  and the children go into the western style portapotties and just use the floor  so about half an hour after they   re cleaned  they   re dirty again  same case with the showers  the drainage  so you have a situation where people don   t have access to all of the hygiene and sanitary needs that putting a large group of people together would require  on top of that  they   re living in tents that are inside buildings  and they   re not designed for people to live in  they   re very crowded  then  you have the underlayer on top of that  which is the services  oftentimes  the food is not desirable  you even had instances during ramadan where people were fasting during the day  and they wouldn   t even eat the food in the evening  and a lack of medical there   s been cases of people who have died because they didn   t have medical response in time  there   s violence  so yeah  there   s a whole slew of things that are making the situation that the migrants are living in less than ideal  and in fact  quite sad  but also dangerous  they have these people came to europe hoping for a better life  fleeing war and have a lot of mental trauma  and frankly  they   re not being received very well  yeah  that   s the reality of the situation right now there is money being spent and resources and people working on it and tremendous amount of volunteers  but the reason why is still a bit of an unknown  there   s only        migrants currently in greece  in turkey for example  you have     million  so it   s not a numbers issue  it   s either a political issue or a lack of efficient deployment of resources could you explain a little bit about how elpida is different from existing migrant housing with the design of elpida  we   ve included opinions from the refugees themselves from the start  in addition to sector leads in wash  water sanitation  hygiene  protection  there   s a lot of issues that go into setting up a refugee camp that are not typical of ordinary construction projects  the idea was to ask them     what would they like to see in a place  what   s lacking in this place     and observe how they set up their social spaces in these informal camps  we looked at how they clustered together amongst families or ethnicity  and really  to the extent of bringing the blueprints into the camps and locating people who were architects back in syria or interior designers  and having them put pen to paper on the actual blueprints  and using those with our architect  haratini  a local greek woman  the reason that she was the architect is because she was willing to take input and have it be a dynamic process that there were changes constantly made as new factors were brought up by people who have experience and by the refugees themselves that   s one of the main difference in elpida  is using the design process that   s iterative and participatory with the end user who are the migrants themselves  some of the things that they requested were privacy and security  natural light  hot water  wi fi  education for their children  and utilizing all of these  that these inputs we started to build out the space  where from scratch  we weren   t going to use tents inside and we located a        square foot former fabric factory and began to demolish it  removed the wiring  and start from scratch in setting up rooms  there are a set of sphere standards  which establish the minimum requirements for temporary housing  they include things like    people per toilet     people per shower      square meters per person living space  natural light  ventilation  one handicap toilet for every     people  these are the minimum standards  we use those to inform our design  but we really wanted to go beyond the minimum because the reality is that many of the migrants that are currently in greece are going to be there for quite a while  there   s a plan to relocate them  but the rest of the eu countries have pretty much stopped or greatly slowed their acceptance of asylum seekers do you know what the cost per person at elpida is versus the cost per person at the official  more traditional camps yeah  in trying to breakdown the cost associated with providing for the refugees  there   s the design and build of the infrastructure  and then there   s the camp operations  we   ve only been open for less than a month now  so we don   t have a full gauge of the operational cost  but as far as the build  the infrastructure setup  what we   ve heard that the large ngo spend on simply water  sanitation  and hygiene         showers  toilets  sinks   at a field camp is greater than what we spent on the entire build out to date  for around     migrants  if you   re looking to compare the cost of the build out for the infrastructure  i   d say we   re right around half of what the typical larger ngos are spending  and the quality is certainly greater  if you look at the toilets for example  when talking to people in the camps  they said     we prefer the squat toilets and a hose  and if you provide that  we   ll clean them ourselves    that   s exactly what we did  we installed porcelain squat toilets with a hose  there   s no toilet paper in the bathroom  and the toilets are spotless  the residents have set up a system where there   s two rooms that are responsible for the men   s toilets per week to rooms that are responsible for the women   s per week  and they rotate  that   s part of the whole concept where again  that this is their home  this is an apartment  they   re fully capable  they used to take care of themselves back in syria  and that   s one of the major fundamental differences and approach that we   re taking is oftentimes  refugees are seen as helpless  and a humanitarian aid system largely creates dependency on itself  one of our main aspirations at elpida and in general with the migrant crisis is shifting people   s opinions about who these refugees are  they have this perception in the media as being dangerous  potential isis  and completely helpless  and scourge on society  and really  these are families  they   re good people  they want the same things that everyone else does  they were a largely middle class  educated part of society back in syria  and if given the proper infrastructure they would be able to run the place themselves  and in fact be able to thrive  they have this pent up      their living situation at the state run camps has largely left them helpless to be able to change their situation  for example  there   s a resident we have named zoher who was a landscaper back in syria  and he   s taken ownership of that at our space he was out all night with a rake in his hands and his knees with no light  creating channels for irrigation  and so we took him to the gardening store the next day  and he bought seeds  and plants  and plumbing to set up a sprinkler system and drip irrigation  he   s had this in him this whole time  one of the main complaints we were hearing from the migrants is that they were bored  and they have nothing to do and they don   t feel empowered  again  this is a cost to maintain a camp where you usually would hire people to pick up the trash and to clean the toilets  and to take care of the grounds if they even go to that extent  but instead  the refugees themselves have a desire  and the skills  and the passion to be able to create and be able to transform the space that we   ve set up for them into their home do you think that   s the main cost savings   the fact that the people living there are contributing to the camp themselves no  i think we do wind up saving money on certain sector lead that we don   t need to have present like wash for example for cleaning the toilets and such  we haven   t been open for a long enough time yet to determine exactly how much what our operating costs are  but this humanitarian crisis is different in several ways  one  the major one is it   s in europe  and a lot of these preexisting ngos have a lot of experience working in africa  and other developing countries that don   t have the same regulations and political climate  working withdifferent codes and complications  i   ve been referring to it as    the great wall of greece    lots of group show up ready to help the refugees  and they run into all sorts of complications where even groups that have received money from the eu don   t know how to effectively spend it  it   s a very complicated political environment  and this has led to part of the fact that there even is this crisis why is it about half the price per person when it sounds like the living conditions are so much better being able to work with private philanthropy money and volunteers is something that   s unique with this project  there isn   t a lot of bureaucratic decision making or overhead that comes with the way that we   ve set it up  one example is we needed door stops and there   s all sorts of horror stories about procurement inside of these large organizations where you need to get a couple bids and fill out a form  where we just took a couple of two by fours and a miter saw and made them in    minutes and had    of them  there   s certain efficiencies that come with being an independent organization  the volunteers have been fantastic  working with the group called better days memoria they have done all the volunteer coordination  we   ve had about     volunteers come through before we even opened our doors  and it   s different working with volunteers who are here because they want to be and they   re really passionate  and this is a calling they have in life versus hiring contractors  we did it half with greek contractors  and then half with volunteers  the contractors are licensed and ensured  and they   re dealing with things like the electricity  and the wiring  and the plumbing  the carpentry  but they essentially come in from seven to four  and they follow the plans and do what the site manager instructs them to  whereas the volunteers add the sparkle they look at a space and bring it to life in their own creative way or they bring different experiences and passions that they have and apply them to the project  it   s remarkable to see what comes out of that because you just have this tremendous desire of people to contribute and to help out  and largely  the state run camps  you   re not able as an independent volunteer to get access to the camp even  you have to be a formerly registered organization  you need to submit a proposal of what you   re going to do  and you need to be approved by the police department  that   s really been nice for us to be able to negotiate a contract with greek migration minister yannis mouzalas  and that stated that we had the final say in design and build because we are providing the funding and we really have seen a lack of proper design in the official camps  and we wanted to ensure that we were providing what the residents themselves requested that   s the underlying philosophy behind the camp is that if we can provide proper infrastructure and enable the residents to participate in the process and to manage the camp themselves  then you   ll really start to see a drop in the violent outbursts between them  and a lot of the problems that you   re seeing at the regular camps would decrease or possibly even go away if you can provide people with a dignified living space and a purpose  and a responsibility and agency over the space  for the most part  it   s worked faster than at least than i expected how many people are in elpida now currently  we have     residents  we   ve had two babies born in the last week  so the number jumped up  we   re largely taking in or we   re only taking in families with vulnerable cases  the way that we set up the rooms  they   re fairly large  and each one has a window and natural light and ventilation  the way that the factory was built  for the top floor at least  which is the only floor we   ve completed at this point  they   re designed for large families  we   ve taken in vulnerable case families   pregnant women  victims of physical or sexual assault  people with health conditions  and if there   s an individual that really needed to get out of the camp  that was what was prioritized by the ministry  but we don   t just take them  we take their entire family to make sure we have family unification are you at capacity now or do you think that the current site could hold more refugees we   re not currently at capacity  part of this being a pilot refugee camp was to do it in stages  we   ve currently only completed the build out of the top floor of a two story building  this was intentional to test the waters and see how this experiment would work  to see how the residents use the space  and to include them in the build out of the downstairs  currently  we have just under     residents  but we are looking to get to a final target of about     what is it going to take to make the scale  not only where you are now  but in other parts around the world although we   ve taken in a number of families  we still get requests on a daily basis from the ministry  from refugees themselves through our facebook group  through volunteers who have identified vulnerable cases  and currently  we are at capacity  so it   s difficult to not be able to take in more  but the answer is we really just need to build more spaces where people can live in a safe environment  the intention from the start of this project is that this is a pilot  if this project can serve an example of how resources can be more efficiently used  i think that could be really helpful  we   ve had a writer who   s been following us throughout the process  instead of having her piece come out in a magazine or something  we   re looking to get this published in an academic journal  so maybe not with the same distribution  but a more targeted approach to some of the decision makers and the policy makers and the administrators of these larger organizations we have a number of site visits where we   ve had all of the big agencies come through the space and have had visits from the u s  consulate general  at this point  we   re really just honing it  i look at my deployment degrees in phases  the first couple of weeks was observation and going around and visiting as many camps as i could in greece and a few in turkey  talking to the locals and the ngos and the refugees themselves  then  the second phase was identifying a site and securing it and getting a contract signed with the ministry of migration to be able to be able to be an official camp  the third phase was design  build  and recruitment of partners and sector leads the fourth phase  that we   re currently in right now  is camp management  we have residents there  we   re figuring out systems  situations are arising that we couldn   t fully anticipate  and as things are leveling out and we   re getting our systems in place  the next phase is about how we start to really bring some of the innovative solutions out there to honing the camp and making it as self sufficient as possible  some of these things could include growing food on site and setting the residents up with their own kitchens so they can cook for themselves  and really start to hone the process so that the project is really serving as a pilot  but this is an iterative process and we   re really just trying to figure out how the residents want to use the space this model is scalable  part of trying to help the economic crisis simultaneously with the refugee crisis is instead of building field camps  upgrading greek infrastructure  in some ways  it   s almost reminiscent of detroit  there   s a lot of projects that started that never finished construction  there   s a lot of finished projects that are currently vacant  i think that   s where the scalability can happen  by utilizing the massive amount of resources that are being poured into this humanitarian crisis  and use it to upgrade greek infrastructure  the current pritzker prize winner from chile  alejandro aravena  is working with this concept of incremental architecture where he doesn   t complete the housing units  he has the residents move in and allow some of the budget to be left over to complete the building to their liking after seeing him win the prize a few months ago and reading some of the articles  i couldn   t help but see his final product being what   s currently available all over greece  i think there   s a number of different ways that we can reach a greater number of camps and of housing units that are up to standard  and those can come in a variety of ways from taking over abandoned buildings  vacant apartment complexes  resorts  but really focusing on how do we take this and make it an investment in the future of greece and not just a stopgap that   s going to be wasted one thing that i   m curious about is your personal involvement and interest in that  what   s your background and how did you get interested in this project and end up becoming project manager i   ve always had an interest in creating spaces  the spaces that i   m most interested in are ones that are curated by the people who use them  so applying some of the concepts that have come about in the last        years as we have digital communication such as open source and user generated content and open apis  and applying those back to the physical realm  now  when you have the ability to copy and paste something  you can make trillions of copies with no additional cost  that   s one of the conditions that allows some of these concepts like open source and user generated content thrive  now  if you have a situation where you don   t have to pay rent for a building because it   s not currently being utilized and you can activate it  you can allow those same concepts to come into the decision making and the ethos of the building you   re inhabiting i   ve done several activations  from screening the world cup in uganda in       to helping create resource centers and post disaster zones  to urban revitalization  taking empty buildings and renting them for a dollar a month  and opening them up to the community in a project called  freespace   the brother of amed khan is a friend of mine who   s familiar with my work at freespace  he just forwarded an email to me while i was at iftf   s ten year forecast this year and said that they were looking for someone to open a camp  and that previous refugee camp experience wasn   t required  they were just looking for someone who can figure out situations on the ground and work not in a structured environment  i got an email on a thursday  and got on a plane on a monday and went out there to observe the situation and see what we could do to set up a space with these same kind of principles of iterative design and creating agency  and a human centered design approach to setting up a refugee camp that   s really amazing  congratulations on doing something that sounds like it has a lot of potential yes  it   s still early  refugees in greece right now is a very complicated situation  sometimes it feels like a house of cards  but we are really proud of the team that   s come together and stepped up and created something that really is something to be proud of  and first and foremost is providing a safe space to our residents when are you headed back out there that   s a question even if i   m going back  i feel like i must  i   m pretty hooked  and i feel uniquely qualified and even more qualified than i was when i went the first time on a whim  just being able to have the relationships already in greece and built a reputation for ourselves as implementers which is not very common in a country right now  i don   t know  i   m heading up to burning man and that   s usually a good place for me to ask those questions and figure out a plan a totally different kind of encampment yes  that   s another one of the concepts  which may happen next spring  is to set up a burning man type festival for about         do a design charrette beforehand and come up with what to some of the ideal materials are and systems and processes  and then purchase the materials and recruit builders and basically set it up  have a party  and then leave it in place  don   t take it down  it   s a leave a positive trace festival for more information about mike zuckerman   s work and about everything iftf does  visit iftf
