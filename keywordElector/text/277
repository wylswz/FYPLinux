social science used to be more fun  i imagine  during freud   s epoch         when it was just developing   i was recently asked to be part of a panel about vc and fundraising at a technology conference  i   hello  i   m glad that you care about women   s rights and want to be an ally  this makes you   i sometimes wish i could find a socially appropriate way to give classes in this  the trouble is   you know  men  they   re mostly not interested in hearing another man tell them to be respectful and attentive and things incidental  related idea  because of my attitude towards women  i always felt self conscious around men
