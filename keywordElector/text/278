manners matter ok  versailles etiquette seems pretty awful     those wanting to speak to the king were not to knock on his door  instead  using the left little finger  they had to gently scratch on the door until they were granted the permission to enter the room  many courtiers grew that fingernail longer than the others for that purpose     or     only ushers were allowed to open doors  if you desired to leave the room  you had to wait for the usher to open the door    pure  nightmare  not nice hoodie    what   s up dude    stuff  now  replace    louis    by    vc    or    big potential enterprise customer    or    mentor    or    talent     you get this     if you displeased a vc customer mentor talent  she would simply not see you the following day     agree i   ve been living and working in silicon valley for almost   years now  and i  as a frenchman  made tons of mistakes  i even dressed up for my very first meeting at google  mountain view  ca  really  i wore a tie  nobody can beat that  it took the googlers a full minute to realize that i was not a limo driver  if you want to avoid this kind of issue  click here  i learned there is an etiquette in silicon valley  actually  there is an etiquette when you do business  anywhere  period the valley has its own culture  i see lots of foreign founders arriving in san francisco  they assume that because people look just like them  things will work the same way as they do at home big  mistake  just as with any other region  there are some need to know basics in silicon valley  etiquette has a purpose  to grease the wheels of society  and ensure things get done without too many feathers getting ruffled in silicon valley  some principles do matter  efficiency  respect  and communication  california is for sure the    land of the cool     but don   t get it wrong  things are codified so here are the main underlying rules i learned         painfully           i know it sounds trivial  follow them and you   ll be just fine     the king will see you the following day     do otherwise and you    will cease to count at silicon versailles    being on time is a    signalling    issue  we live in an environment with imperfect information  people don   t know much about you  if anything at all  to mitigate this issue  they will use any signals to hint something about you  and people are hungry for signals  late  in one fell swoop  you are sending   messages pretty bad  right you are on time or you are out of business  if you are going to be late for whatever reason         yes  it happens           send a message at least    minutes before and say being on time is so important that such a prominent vc firm as andreessen horowitz charges its staff     per minute if they   re late for a meeting with entrepreneurs  watch this  please   it   s a question of respect  first and foremost oh  by the way  being    on time    means being       minutes in advance you have few hours to answer the emails you receive  same day is the norm  next day is acceptable  anything beyond    hours could be a problem     signalling    again  a same day answer signals i often fail at obeying this rule  it is tough  but it matters  a lot you can   t do anything without valuable connections and solid network  it   s true for everybody  it   s even essential for foreign founders who  by definition  know few         if any         people  introductions are to entrepreneurs what gasoline is to cars  required to move forward introductions are one of the most codified areas of valley etiquette  here are the key principles this is how it works  there are   scenarii sounds trivial  right  well  many people don   t play by this rule the double opt in introduction means that it may eventually be rejected  if you can   t accept that  don   t play the game  i recommend some great posts here  by fred wilson  or here people have very limited time  time is valuable  ceos  vcs  c level execs  everyone  therefore  a poorly designed email is like throwing a message in a bottle  pray it won   t end up on an empty shore your communication must be succinct    points    lines max   crystal clear  no phd in philosophy required to understand you   and precise  data  data  data    see rule    below  michael seibel  ceo at ycombinator  wrote a great post on    how to email early stage investors     he said it all  what   s true for early stage investors is true for everyone else  a mentor  a customer  a talent to hire  a journalist at techcrunch  a guy who could make an introduction for you   a   bullet email should look like this that   s it  by the way  did you know that vcs read the average pitch deck in        you can bet they won   t take more than     to read an email   good karma  to me  is the essence of silicon valley   s culture  it means that if you do something good  something good will happen to you  it   s the foundation of the pay it forward attitude  it translates into this question that everyone you see for the first time will ask     how can i help you     be full of good karma  full of gratitude  thank people  someone made an introduction that helped you move forward  thank them  send them an email to follow up and keep them informed on what happened  it didn   t really help  come on  thank them anyways  somebody helped you    help them as well  or at least  try  give back to people  as much as you can  the magic is awesome well  and that   s the rule now we are diving deep into protocol  i don   t remember who said it but i personally love the quote     people who enjoy meetings should not be in charge of anything     there are   types of meetings the difference lies in the susbtance of the item s  to be discussed  if things and decisions can be wrapped up in    mn  why should you request         and block    a  hour slot in the other person   s agenda  if you request a       mn meeting     you show that you presumably know how the system works  you earn free points in this video  vinod khosla  founder of sun microsystems and khosla ventures  recalls that his agenda is organized in    mn slots    this may be extreme  but productive people are extremely organized              easy in a    mn call  after    mn  hang up the phone  in a  h meeting  after  h  you leave  this is what i do best lots of successful entrepreneurs in the valley have accent      of u s  unicorns were co founded by immigrants   st or  nd generation   immigration is one of the key engines of the region   s prosperity so being a foreigner is not a problem at all  that said  you must be to get your point across  obviously  accent is ok  not speaking english is not ok  to thrive  you must be able to express yourself properly  with nuance and accuracy  improving your english must be a priority from day    otherwise you will face discrimination at some point of your journey  pretty quickly actually oops  there is one other thing the meaning of some  of their  english words may be a little different from what you have learned at school  let   s take some examples    what you do is awesome       translation     you are ok       your product is ok      translation     it sucks  i won   t buy it for sure       thanks  we had a great meeting      translation     thanks for visiting       thanks for the meeting  let   s schedule a second one with some other folks      translation     this was really interesting  we want to know more about you    a follow up meeting    this is the feedback you need to get  forget the rest it is fair to assume that    everything is awesome    in the valley  your product is    the best in the world     your technology is    unique     your team is    world class     your revenue is    growing super fast    and your market is    f ing huge     yes  you    will change the world     in short  you are    killing it     but i would recommend deleting these words from a  your vocabulary  b  your deck  c  your pitch people are data driven  there is nothing better  clearer  more objective and comparable than data  vcs  mentors  talents  customers will immediately see through your data that you are really unique and best in show different businesses and maturity stages have different data types  tam   sam   som  mom   yoy growth  mrr   arr  acv  rev churn   cust churn  cohort analysis  ltv  cac  dau   wau   mau  gmv  retention rate  burn rate  and so on  let your data speak for you  forget superlatives  do not look like this this is one of the hardest things  it is largely linked to the type of education received  i guess  it is a priceless skill  telling a story is key in the valley  and everywhere else by the way   it   s the most effective way to engage with people and raise awareness it is the best way to sell that   s the whole point  you have to be in a sales mode  all  the  time  night and day  you want to hire a talent  you must sell your vision  you are talking to a customer  you must sell your product  obviously  you are pitching a vc  you are literally selling a portion of your company  you are meeting with a journalist  she needs to sell you to her readers in other words  every pitch must be a story  now  how do you do this  a good story connects your point to something bigger  could be a mission  could be an emotion  could be a journey  but whatever it may be  it must engage the other person  a story is a well designed script  it is a missile  with a precise target telling a story is tough  it   s an art  it   s a process  it requires a lot of work  but if you want to come to the valley  be prepared to tell good  engaging stories  everyone does  remember you are not far from hollywood  in fact  you are in    techlywood    again  my apologies if all of this sounds trivial  it should be  i would be more than happy to read your views  feel free to add comments and any other remarks or stories on    how to behave in the valley     i  for sure  need to learn
