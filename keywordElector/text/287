i always considered myself to be fairly intelligent  i was a fast learner  i could digest ideas quickly and repurpose them at appropriate times  i never however  considered myself particularly    brilliant     and i still don   t   if you ask my friends to describe me in one word i doubt    smart    would be the first thing that comes to mind  not that they don   t think i   m intelligent  but i was never the stereotypical bookworm that people normally associate with intelligence it was either learn quickly  or get eaten alive  this was a scenario that i wasn   t super familiar with unless it pertained to feats of creativity  which had always come easy for me  no  i   m talking about subjects like finance  math  taxes  corporate structure  analytics  data science  strategy and the list goes on and on  once put in this scenario i had two options  read everything i could as quickly as i could  or continue to live blind to subjects i had never had interest in and let my company fail through this process i realized something  we   re conditioned to compartmentalize ourselves  to learn at an early age that we   re    really good    at this one thing or that one thing  and to just focus on those strengths instead of exploring your weaknesses  this causes a mentality that can make people give up on certain things before they even have a chance to try i hear my own words in my head constantly as i   m looking at our fiscal records the doubt is planted in my brain from a couple of poorly executed math tests when i was in high school  and inherently caused me to believe i couldn   t learn unless given the right circumstance  unfortunately for me that circumstance was wake up  you don   t have a choice  the idea that we have strengths in certain areas then becomes slightly damaging  it damns people to a life of only focusing on what they   re naturally good at  and makes them believe deep down that they can   t learn the things they may have struggled with initially so i   m here to tell you  through experience  through a do or die environment  through several late nights sweating into a    corporate finance for dummies book     wondering if i   ll ever grasp these oddly mundane concepts  that you   re smarter than you think you are  so go learn something ceo   creative director of  starthatching  innovator  game changer  tech guru  head of cabbage  pencil shaving  glass of milk  well rounded dog bowl    wait
