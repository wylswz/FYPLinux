ah  this was a long time ago  when i was just finishing college         early      s  she catered for a few years until her friend got cancer and passed away  i was lucky enough to help  carry things  pour champagne at events  wash up set up         not cook         i couldn   t cook then   and learn many things from her  she quit catering  went back to work running a country club and then retired  she passed away this year in her    s  and i will miss all the times we worked together i learned a lot about cooking for crowds from her  which i do often  i am the one who cooks up lunch for    for a meeting at a place i contract  just because i like to  or for     at a conference i am volunteering  it is always rewarding  but a hard physical way to earn a living  i love planning the menu  keeping notes on quantities and what people like and pleasing them  it is a way i can volunteer behind the scenes  i cooked brunch for     for a judge   s fundraiser to support her and felt great when she was elected this year  i   d rather be in the kitchen than in the spotlight any time i hope you continue to find ways to enjoy preparing food for others  it sounds like you found it rewarding amidst all the effort non profit advisor  educator  small time investor  amateur naturalist  lover of appalachia
