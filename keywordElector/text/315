hi folks  the following is a good guide for how to treat women on the internet  whether you are a dude  a lady  a genderqueer person  or a unicorn who somehow gained the ability to read english  jk we all know unicorns can read any language they damn well please   i   ve seen men engage in some of the practices i describe unfavorably  but guess what  i   ve seen gals do it too this is not about one instance in my own life but a series of many instances in my own life and in the lives of other folks online  some of you don   t like what you perceive as    p c  bullshit     this ain   t about your notion of political correctness  which is usually code for    being a decent human being     but whatever  i   m not here to quibble with you on that and i   m a blasphemous broad myself so i get your frustration when you feel you   re being cramped   but this is about acting like a good person and not a damn fool i   m laid up sick with an upper respiratory infection and yet i   m still doing this kind service because stupid behavior on the internet exhausts me  and i want to be able to just link folks to this where necessary  feel free to do so as well  let   s go if you get blocked or unfriended  do not ask why  do not approach  we did it for a reason  probably not drunkenness  although that is possible   if we want to tell you why  we will  go be a good person and imagine it   s just because we were having a bad day  or ask yourself why and really look at why we might   ve decided not to engage with you further  if you want to say to yourself     what a dumb bitch     i guess do that  whatever  just don   t say it to us  stay away if you dm us on twitter and we don   t respond  don   t dm us again  this is simple if we tell you to take us out of a thread on twitter or elsewhere  do it  don   t ask why  ever  there may be someone in that thread of whom we have grown weary or with whom we stopped engaging a long time ago  it   s quite likely they   ve harassed us and we   ve blocked them  but when you respond to all of us  we still get the tweets clogging our feed  alternately  we may simply be busy and not have time to keep up just do it imagine we asked if you could move your car so we could back out of the driveway  you   d just do that  right  it   s easy  okay  just do this untag us you know when eliza in    hamilton     c   mon bro  you   ve listened  your bro has   says     i remove myself    from the whole story  she   s in a situation that is too painful and sad so lin manuel miranda  who is a certified genius for real  gives her the out  later she jumps back in of her own volition  that   s us  except we don   t have a wonderful dude doing it for us  because we   re writing our own narrative here  be an ally or just a decent person and respect that choice do not respond to every tweet  every facebook status update  every post we create anywhere on the web  being a fan is a fantastic thing  i   m a fangirl myself  love the fangirls and the fanboys of this world  but this goes beyond fandom  when you give the impression that you seem to think you   re in a constant conversation with us  it feels creepy to us  often  this is an issue of you having trouble recognizing boundaries  and that   s not always your fault  we are all wired differently and we have gifts and difficulties  sometimes around perception  so if you   re a person with a good heart who may perceive things differently than most  you   re still probably going to respect a boundary once it   s explained to you but there are others who are not that way there are others to whom i say  why do you have all the time in the world to do that  go look at other cool stuff too  art  music  politics  your kids    homework  buy a solange album  yes  the latest is fantastic but she   s always been great  never afraid to experiment  revels in evolution and progression  did you know  go listen   and don   t bother solange  she deals with enough  if we never respond to you  we probably muted you on twitter or unfollowed you on facebook but stayed friends with you so as not to enrage you or upset our mothers because you still live in the small town where we grew up and our moms have to deal with you at the grocery store  the muting or unfollowing may be because you   re annoying or you have terrible opinions or horrific taste in furniture and yet you won   t stop posting photographs of your awful furniture don   t ask us if we muted you it may be because you seem unstable and we don   t want to further inflame you by blocking you   did you know that this is how we have to deal with folks online for our own safety  it   s true  usually the folks with whom we have to contend in this manner are men  not always  do not make sexual or flirtatious comments on the social media of a woman you don   t know  if you do know her personally in a sexy way and you make such a comment and she checks you on it  back off  you   ll know if she wants to fuck you because she   ll fucking fuck you  until then  exercise some restraint  it   s better for your soul and your dong in the long run  i   m giving you strategy here  dude  if you want to shtup us  shut up and be a good person  we find mystery exciting   that   s not always true  it just sounded like something that would be in a maxim article from       if we block a person or unfriend someone  do not ask why  do not say he   s a really great guy and look  he   s really sorry he is not a really great guy  we do not block or unfriend guys who   ve been really great to us go way there are people to whom i will never speak unless absolutely necessary and with whom i will never work unless i have to  and it   s specifically because they thought it was time to play cupid for creeps  you have no idea what we deal with and what we hear privately  it   s not your business your nice guy friend who is nice to you and is so nice to your daughter and has never raped a woman in front of your face and who maybe says he   s super sorry  yeah  he may be a serial harasser  a rapist  or a dude who punched us in the face one night in a drunk blackout  you don   t get to know that information unless we want to tell you  you don   t know the shit we know about him and we   re not telling and you and he should be so fucking thankful for that  is he married  oh  be a thousand times more thankful  you know a tiny bit of the story  and it   s all filtered through him i   m sorry to be the one to tell you this but your boy is an unreliable fucking narrator back off and if he   s pleaded with you to be the intermediary and you actually did it  congrats  you fell for it  he   s an abuser trying desperately to draw his prey back in  he   s using you for that purpose  stop being stupid and get better friends if somebody says mean things about us elsewhere  do not tell us unless you genuinely fear for our safety  then tell us  we can choose whether we wish to alert the authorities  you win zero points with folks you want to love you when you say     look at this stranger talking shit  look at me defending you  i   m such a great person     oh really  we see right through that     mean girls    came out a long time ago  this ain   t high school  go away do not give out our contact information without asking our permission  some of us have websites and places where that information is readily available  because we   re happy to engage with requests we can honor  direct them to these places if necessary  and if we don   t respond  sometimes it   s a safety issue  sometimes it   s simply an    i   m busy    issue women get endless requests for help and assistance in various ways at various times  everybody in the world thinks they have the right to our time  our money  our emotional labor  our business contacts  the works  this is true whether you are a gal of note on the teevee or a gal who is awesome and definitely of note with zero interest in having her name in the newspapah  we can field those requests with grace if we wish  or we can ignore them  that does not make us rude  that does not make us ungenerous  that does not make us bad people i gave up nice a long time ago  nice did me no good as a woman  niceness is a lie they teach you to keep you sweet and compliant while you   re screaming inside  you know what picked instead  kindness  i chose to be kind  kind means i respect your boundaries and you respect mine when we speak about abuse and we don   t use names and we don   t give clues  there is a reason for that  do not dare question our choices to tell our stories and to use anonymity and discretion to protect ourselves and the people we love  we do not owe it to you to name names  we do not owe it to you to be the heroine  we are not cartoon characters  we are not fairy tale princesses  we are not imagined fearless  flawless brave warrior women sent from on high to do battle with dragons while you sit from afar and say     yeah girl  get it    look  you wanna know why we don   t name names  beyond    discretion    and    etiquette    and    not wanting to get sued for saying something that   s true but that we can   t prove because nobody was in the room when it happened     because we don   t want to get hit  slapped  raped  beaten  or killed if you do not know how present that is in our lives  even in my own privileged life  this is my invitation to you to listen the next time a lady says     he   he wasn   t   i mean he tried to be a good person  i really think he   s a good person but   you know   there were issues     and then looks away uncomfortably  what   s her body language saying  you might consider saying     i   m here if you need to talk  i don   t expect you to and i   m not pressuring you to  but know that i won   t tell anybody and i won   t judge you    and then  for god   s sake  honor that commitment to your friend  your colleague  your sister  your mom  whoever  and if they don   t wanna chat  leave it  leave  it  alone and by the way  this is how you should treat everybody  i drew you in with that    ladies    headline but this is actually about treating human beings with dignity in physical space or online space you are part of a collective whole and i am addressing the whole  if you and i have had a personal interaction in which i have expressed displeasure  do not approach me about this  just do better in future if you have had a personal interaction with a woman who is not me and she has told you to go away  stay away  don   t go back and say     i   ve changed     unless you   re working a program that asks you do so  within reason  your amends should not be her burden  she may not wish to forgive you now or ever  and that is her right good people make mistakes  i know i do  all the time  but we apologize unless it would be stressful or dangerous or offensive to the injured party  we move forward and we do better  just because you   ve violated certain boundaries of politeness and ideal human behavior does not automatically make you a monster person  okay  so don   t go into some shame spiral  shame is useless unless it prompts better action  take this information  think on it  do good things in the world i   m going back to being physically ill now  share this with friends and neighbors and the aforementioned magical unicorns who can read everything  not that unicorns need this information  they   re born compassionate and polite  the rest of us can often use a little help with that comedian and author  my latest book is real artists have day jobs http   amzn to  jwsgxi
