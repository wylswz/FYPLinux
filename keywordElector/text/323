i am writing this not to call you out  or to shame you  quite frankly  mr degrasse tyson  in your field of study i can   t imagine there was ever any reason for you to learn about dyspareunia  while your dealings with the spectacular universe and exploding stars is important  fascinating  spell binding work  there is a cosmos within the female human body that i would encourage you to explore         because it is infinitely complex and varied  and there is so much to learn about life here on earth through the study of it sex was painful for me  a woman in her early twenties  for several reasons  not least of all was because it   s been culturally normalized for much of my existence to include pain  menstruation  sexual intercourse  childbirth         these foundations of womanhood have pain as a common denominator  and when i was coming of age  it was instilled in me that this was just my lot in life  simply due to biology the problem was  and remains  that science doesn   t know how much a normal period should hurt  how much pain during sex is    okay    and not the result of some pathology  even childbirth  which i have not experienced  is seen as a pain totem  women are judged for not enduring it  for accepting some kind of relieving medical intervention womanhood is a culture held together through our physical pain  yet the medical profession and society as a whole still refuses to acknowledge it for the better part of three years  after i became acutely ill and was forced to drop out of college because i was in the hospital more than i was in class  doctors told me that my pain was    all in my head            and i was very willing to believe them  i didn   t want to be sick  i didn   t want to have some pathological  physical ailment that would take my education  my relationships  my life away from me before any of it had really begun as i lay curled up on gurneys in hospitals  i did not want to be there  i wanted to be in the lecture hall  the laboratory  the dance studio  i wanted to be with my friends  i did not want to be in pain it wasn   t until i began having sex that i realized the extent of my pain  because when it began i had been a virgin  i could not tell the doctors if sex was painful because i had not had it yet  i knew that i could not wear tampons because they hurt  i knew that desperate attempts at masturbation was disappointingly uncomfortable  as though my reproductive organs were all knotted up and any jostling at all was like a punch to the gut  i knew that my routine gynecological check ups hurt so much that i would cry  and the doctor would always frown and say     now that   s not normal             yet they would do nothing further  because it wasn   t that my pain was perhaps abnormal  just my response to it couldn   t i just suck it up i engaged in sexual intercourse  despite the fact that it was painful  for many years  i did this because the people in my life         my partner  my doctors  the internet at large  told me that it was normal and i just had to learn to deal with it  i just had to find a position that was    more comfortable            not good  mind you  not enjoyable         merely    tolerable     i should do more kegel exercises  i should  perhaps  try physical therapy for my vagina         which was probably just not used to the great phallus of man  despite the fact that i had been  like all women  getting systematically fucked by it in regard to the patriarchal society into which i was born         through another misunderstood and under appreciated vagina  i might add so  for years i tolerated sex that was painful because that   s what i was taught to do  that was just what women did  it was what my partner expected me to do  and at last  when i finally could not take it anymore  when i could not hide the bleeding  the tears and the pain  i went back to the doctor and i took my male partner and when he said  to a medical professional  that my pain was impacting our sex life  that he was no longer satisfied  all of a sudden it became a crisis  my pain  in and of itself  had never been valid  it had never mattered but the moment it became an inconvenience to a man         when it directly impacted the quality of a heteronormative sexual relationship         well  then it became a serious problem that was worthy of attention still  they were reluctant to open me up because they did not think any physical explanation existed  even though  when i had first gotten sick years earlier  they had opened me up and found a large cyst on my fallopian tube  which had twisted it  as though someone was wringing it out like you might a damp towel  they found spots of endometriosis but did not know what to do about it  so they did nothing but despite this  the surgeon still said to me he told me that he   d do another exploratory surgery  just to humor me  he told me that he if he found nothing  he would have to discharge me from his practice because there was nothing left he could do for me i had taken to him research that i had done  independently  showing that endometriosis could grow basically anywhere  and that in addition  it was possible for the appendix to become chronically inflamed  it was rare  but i fit the symptom profile  it seemed possible to me that endometriosis  or even just a low level of inflammation that became chronic  could cause a person plenty of problems  be in the chronic nausea i dealt with daily  or the painful sex  or the painful bowel movements and urination  or that sinking feeling whenever we would go over a bump in the road when my boyfriend and i were driving around our rural town  that something was inside of me waiting to rupture my pain was real  mr degrasse tyson  and i had been correct in my diagnosis  unfortunately  it had come far too late and damage had been done  and the underlying chronic inflammation  the endometriosis  had been so pernicious and invisible         to everyone but me         that i would continue to have pain  i would continue to get no joy from food  from sex  from dance         from all the primal pleasures i am here on earth to enjoy  because the men and women of medicine did not believe my pain was real i know that in your line of work you do not require this education  but you are a human being  you are a husband  you have a daughter  no doubt you have female colleagues that you respect  no doubt you have students who you want to watch prosper and thrive because of your teaching i had professors like you in college  and when i got sick and had to abandon my studies  they were so disappointed  and it broke my heart to think that i had let them down despite what my pain  what my disease  took away from me  i   m devoting what quality of life i have to educating others  i   m writing a book  which has been already purchased by a major publisher  one that is even bigger than mcgraw hill  which published many of the textbooks i referenced when i was trying to get to the source of my very real  very observable  very quantifiable pain in your tweet  you assumed that a species that experienced painful sexual intercourse would go extinct  and in fact  i agree  i feel that without the pleasure of sex  without the pleasure of food  without enjoying dance and music the way that i once did  without being able to spend time with my friends and loved ones in nature  or traveling  or even just having an evening out to dinner  i have become an endangered species myself i will be    years old next month and i would not be at all surprised if  at some point in the next    years  i do become extinct  because there is little interest in addressing  treating and researching the pain that i live in  i am still expected to    grin and bear it     even as it exhausts me so that i cannot physically get out of bed the women suffering from painful intercourse are not extinct yet  mr degrasse tyson  but we are frightfully close to getting there very sincerely and with all due respect abby normanalways fascinated  writing a memoir for nation books  literary agent  tisse takagi    essays
