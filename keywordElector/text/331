energy storage as an industry is no longer a curiosity or academic pursuit  creating a future which is      renewable will require the collective focus of the entire energy industry  with its ability to support the weaknesses of variable resources such as wind and solar  low cost storage is the catalyst to a carbon free world  but there are doubters who claim costs can   t drop without deep science and huge breakthroughs  for those doubters  let   s take a trip down the memory lane of a similar disruption we just witnessed in the solar industry in       when i entered the solar industry  a solar panel cost       per watt  and entire installations were not uncommon at     per watt  by virtually all measures  these were not economically competitive systems  as entrepreneurs back then  when we went to pitch vcs and talk to the media about the coming solar revolution  we would often refer to a    per watt number  this was described as a distant aspiration         likely to take    years  even from the most sympathetic of vcs or journalists  we were met with a    yeah  right    response  few stopped to ask details about whether this was distributed or central system reference  or even whether we were talking about just the panel or an entire installation this    watt target was an extraordinary goal         we were talking about an order of magnitude reduction in the cost of installation of solar  the last reduction of that scale in solar took nearly    years  yet  here we are today  seeing large scale projects being built with costs either at or just hovering above the one dollar mark  fully installed  let   s take a moment to soak in that milestone  and acknowledge that even the most passionate evangelists among us doubted we would get here this quickly while there are many people to thank for this transformation  and many areas of cost reduction to credit  there is one component which stands out  crystalline silicon  the radical reduction of the cost of solar grade silicon over the last    years has been the single largest component driving the cost curve of solar all the while  ceos  pundits and investors continued to believe that new chemistries and technologies would leap frog polycrystalline cells and beat the old standard to the dollar per watt goal  i was one of those entrepreneurs  focused on building a tracking concentrator based around gallium arsenide cells  when silicon was      kg  or even when it was half that  our company   s unique offering had terrific economics  by comparison of course in hindsight  we know how that story ends  we were wrong  the cost of a kilogram of silicon indeed dropped below       then       and seems to have finally settled below      this  combined with incredible learning curves throughout the production and installation supply chains  is what has brought us to our magical number of one dollar per installed watt  this also means that the tracking technology  along with various flavors of thin film companies  solyndra  miasole  nanosolar  etc   simply couldn   t compete  the staggering dominance of this singular old school technology cannot be overstated  billions of dollars of venture and other investment were wiped out by the strength of silicon   s ability to drive down costs  with the rare exceptions of first solar and solar frontier  no other companies created material scale without crystalline silicon as part of their formula for the coming energy storage revolution  there is much to be learned from this solar history  energy storage as an industry is about to undergo the same radical scaling exercise we just witnessed with solar  in this scaling  you can also expect to see some of the very same trends and results a central theme  of course  is cost reduction  and the challenge of differing technologies to get there  out in front is the current industry standard of lithium ion  while there are many flavors of lithium ion  they  like silicon before it  share a common chemical core  if energy storage is the new solar  lithium ion is the new crystalline silicon  there are and will continue to be many challengers to li ion   s dominance  but just as with silicon in solar  these chemistries are likely to fail to become a winning solution  there may be a few breakouts for specific applications  flow batteries are a leading contender   but these will be rare exceptions lithium ion and its derivatives are simply too large in scale at this point  with too many uses across too many industries to be disrupted  if the technology is already used in cell phones  computers  hybrid vehicles  etc  how could an entirely new technology scale to match it  massive korean  lg chem  and japanese  panasonic  companies  along with tesla here in the us  are building gigafactories to fill the li ion needs  china  foxconn  huawei  byd  is just getting started  just as with our    watt peak goal in solar  we will find that we can quickly approach the magic      kwh target in storage  the price at which mass adoption is economic  nothing seems to focus the mind these days quite like a tweet from elon musk  okay  maybe a hollywood style announcement from the same mr  musk  reality   s very own tony stark  gets us even more engaged   and these days both his tweets and his announcements are laser focused around energy storage  the hype around this space is starting to reach levels we in the space formerly known as clean tech haven   t seen since the days of nanosolar  solyndra and other solar coaster headlines from a decade ago  we   ve seen this movie before  and while the ending was terrific  there were also tons of carnage  let   s learn from these misdirected efforts to avoid the same disasters this time around a more productive space to investigate and invest in  as was the case with solar  will be the business model         rather than the chemical         engineering of storage  companies like stem  enphase  and greensmith are chemistry agnostic  and will thrive based on all cost reduction  not on any specific winning hardware investors  entrepreneurs and newly minted graduates should all look carefully at the many claims bandied about in energy storage technology business plans  flow batteries  compressed air storage  and more exotic storage chemistries  liquid metal  etc   will mostly go the way of tracking concentrators  cigs and nanomaterials  for the sake of the storage effort as well as the entire industry  let   s learn from history and improve our hit rate this time around we are only now  after decades of hard work  beginning to declare victory in solar cost reduction  the last big push  from              was what edged solar over the line  certainly  when it comes to storage  we have a long way to go         perhaps another decade in this field as well  i hope we can look back at the recent history of solar  extract some lessons  and see if we can   t speed up the storage revolution just
