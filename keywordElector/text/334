in my childhood  i always used to daydream about how could i change this world  in every class  i always used to daydream about how it would be if we could convert the trash into energy  sometimes i used to daydream about how it would be if we build an analytics tools for our govt  and there were no special occasions in my life as a student i stopped day dreaming and concentrated toward the lecture  now i am grown up  yet i didn   t stop dreaming for the better world sleepless nights  restless days and pouncing hearts may seem to be the signs of deep love  but in my case its the love and passion for building my startup which kept me going for nights  writing thousands of lines of codes every day to build    life changing apps two years ago  i had almost zero knowledge in computer science cs   damn it  i didn   t know why db or json or http are used  all that i knew was how to build circuits or how to code hardware using hdl as i was from electronics   comm  background  i was crazily curious though which pulled my interest in cs stuff read how crazily curious i was which made me invent a device which could save     million people every year  here   seven days later    tadaa    wrote my first android app which aggregates data from online e com stores  wrote my first web crawler which crawls and scraps details from websites and was already into live project of building world class android app  all thanks to y media labs and to my stubborn curiosity    days rolled on and within     years i along with the coolest team at y media labs built   world class apps like staples  nest app  google chromecast app  iot project etc    while everything was going totally fine  that day on feb  th       it was the day i was introduced to my first every hackathon in my life and it was from ola the biggest cab aggregator in india and hosted by venturesity  thanks to venturesity for approving my unfilled resume   hacking through the code and building an awesome product from the scratch in just    hours with zero sleep and lots of caffeine  that moment i felt like let this gush of passion for coding keep on going forever  we built an augmented reality based android app for tourists which can show places around on augmented reality and also allows to book a cab with a single click  we also developed cab sharing feature  which is now exactly same as it is there in current ola app  not to under estimate ourselves  we came second place in ola hackathon  not bad though makes    not bad obama face     since that day  i never said no to any hackathon whenever my colleagues call for  i along with my coolest team lead named karthikeyan and super android dev amlan at y media labs had made up a team for all the hackathons  we built    whistler  an automated bug tracker    at yml hackday which automatically rising an alarm when there is critical bug in live build  we also build    big o  an offline wallet    at api hackday and won first place  nov   th       it was my last day at y media labs and my first day of my journey to fulfill my childhood dreams which i dreamed of to make this world a better place  on the day two of my entrepreneurial journey  i had a serious problem  oops   i hadn   t saved any cash and i was left with just rs       in my bank  because my decision to quit yml was a last moment decision  i think that is what    leap of faith    is  i was alone in my journey yet i didn   t lose my hope and i sat down and listed out all the options to make real quick money  i had one option in the list which i loved the most  that is hackathon on day three of my journey  i registered for     international hackathons which had cool cash prizes and started working on them  for every two days from then  i completed an application per contest and submitted it  approximately after    days and     application  i along with my small team won    hackathons out of    and made the sufficient money to bootstrap our company for     year  voila  leap of faith worked we then started prototyping our product named wooexpo  a next gen marketing hub  which has potential to reduce the cost of marketing by
