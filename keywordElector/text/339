a tl dr version is available on techcrunch when we started to work on a european cloud landscape our initial aim at point nine was simply to create a map with the logos of the most important european cloud companies organized by category  easy right  especially for    the    european saas vc      but as we wanted to create more value than just a map with a bunch of logos on it  we decided to take a more granular approach and to analyze this european ecosystem region by region  we also decided to crowdsource it not only will it enable us to analyze the different ecosystems and their specificities in more details but it will also help us connect better with local players who have more knowledge than we do the current plan is we   re currently working on the landscape for the

  c  p removechild t   catch u                let   s start by defining what horizontal or vertical software means percentage of horizontal and vertical companies for the complete list and for vc backed companies only as you can see the majority of the companies listed are horizontal products  and the proportion stays roughly the same whether we take into account the complete list or the vc backed startups only  around                  this is not surprising as building a vertical software generally requires industry specific knowledge   insights which are harder to acquire  less entrepreneurs with these skills  let   s see if it changes when we take the headquarters location into account for french companies which have raised money and are headquartered in france the proportion between vertical and horizontal software is around the same                   whereas all french funded companies  in our list  now headquartered in the us are horizontal software this is a first hint at how vertical and horizontal companies grow differently  horizontal startups tend to go to the us much earlier in their life to capture the us market as fast as possible since it   s their biggest market  and hence they move their headquarters on the other side of the atlantic ocean since vertical software is much more    geography    dependent  local legal specificities  local industry rules and customers etc   internationalization is done differently  they usually first dominate their home market and then expand on a country by country basis  with country managers and local offices but the headquarters generally stays in france  here is what the distribution looks like in terms of software categories for the complete list  note that we are limiting the analysis to    horizontal    startups only vertical software companies answer industry specific needs or and are vertically integrated and hence are way harder to categorize  so we   re not taking them into account here it seems that the marketing and developers categories are the most    popular    ones in our list with almost     of the startups listed let   s look at the same graph but for vc backed companies only the distribution looks the same with marketing stealing the first position to the developers category  it seems like investors are keen on putting their money there we can also notice that the trailing categories  which are crm   sales  collaboration productivity  bi analytics  finance   legal and hr  are all between      and      obviously security is obviously a small category as the talents and skills required to build security solutions are more scarce the combo developers   marketing   sales   crm accounts for more than     of our list of     companies now let   s have a look at the information we can extract from a funding perspective  obviously we   re analyzing only vc backed startups and not taking into account bootstrapped ones if we analyze the complete list of funded startups       we can see that the average amount raised is     m and the median is     m  it   s hard to draw any strong conclusion based on this  so let   s compare that to the average and median funding for horizontal and vertical startups horizontal startups vertical startups interestingly horizontal companies raise more money than vertical ones on average      m vs     m  but the value is almost the same for the median value      m vs     m  out of the    companies which have raised more than    m    are horizontal        it explains why there   s such a difference between the average values and not between the median values  there are many more horizontal companies which end up raising huge amount of money than vertical ones one hypothesis is that these very successful horizontal startups tend to go to the us more than vertical ones      of horizontal startups with    m  raised are headquartered in the us   where they can attract  and need  more money since the vertical startups don   t have the same playbook  they first dominate their home market before expanding on a country   region basis  they tend to stay at home longer where it   s harder to attract    big money    but this trend is also changing with the maturation of the cloud market for many verticals  out of the   vertical companies which have raised more than    m two are relatively    new    players  mirakl and doctolib   so there   s definitely a    new generation    effect here  i think we   ll see this gap closing in the years to come with more ambitious vertical focused startups attracting big money from us investors we would  of course  love to hear your take on that in the comments if we analyze funding by location of the headquarters we can notice a huge difference between us headquartered companies and the ones which keep their hq in france french startups with fr hq french startups with us hq as you can see the differences are huge  here is one interpretation again  don   t hesitate to share your own interpretation with us as i   ve already explained it   s hard to use traditional categories for vertical software so the following graph concerns only horizontal startups taking into account vc backed companies only  the number of        employees companies drops dramatically  more money  more employees  cities where us headquarters are it   s not all about san francisco and silicon valley as     of the us headquartered french companies listed are based in new york thanks for reading and don   t hesitate to share your comments with us directly on medium which cloud companies are included in the list is this list of french cloud companies exhaustive hell no  i wish but it   s not the case  i   m really aware of the limitation of such a study but i believe that done is better than perfect  this list is a starting point  we   ll keep adding companies and update the graphs  if you spot companies which are missing please contact me  i will be happy to add them   email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script   e t length e    if t e  getattribute  data

exploring sources such as both manually and through apis then we enriched our data thanks to the startup databases mentioned above  crunchbase and angel list  and also with clearbit and linkedin one thing i can say for sure is that there is no silver bullet and no source is self sufficient  for example we found many interesting french companies not listed on crunchbase  or with missing information  where can i see the list and its data here can you tell me a little more about the data available for each startup startup name   url   crunchbase link  self explanatoritype  can be either horizontal or vertcategory  macro software categoricurrently we have a short note on software categories  first there is no perfect categorization  i tried to stick to what other firms like bessemer or emergence have done but i also simplified some categories like the    developers    one which contains subcategories like developer tools  apis  infrastructure etc  or bundled marketing and sales together second for each startup i chose the category myself  i   ve checked the     companies listed and decided to which category they belong  sometimes it   s clear and sometimes the line between two categories can be blurry for a tool  so i   m well aware that it might be subjective in some cases and i   m more than open to discuss changes industry  the industry in case of a vertical softwartags  some keywords or a short sentence used to describe the company   productraised  the amount of money raised  if the cell is empty it means i have no info headquarters  location of the
