the uk   s new government has not been shy in calling out broken markets  theresa may herself has talked repeatedly about markets that aren   t serving consumers  returning to the energy market time and again as an example the pm   s speech to conservative conference was no exception  noting the number of people on expensive energy tariffs  and the message was backed up loud and clear by business minister greg clark  who said  no doubt choosing his words carefully  the government now has a duty to act why is the energy market coming in for such criticism  and are ministers right that this is an area where a bolder approach could help the answer is yes on both counts  it   s now hard to deny that britain   s energy market is broken in some basic respects  and it looks like action might be needed to put that right to understand why  you have to go beyond the headline figures that are often used to describe the energy market   s failings  yes  we know that switching rates are horribly low  only     of people have switched their energy deal in the last three years  and  yes  this is in spite of the fact that many households could save around       a year by switching but the issue goes beyond bad outcomes to systemic problems in the market for one thing  that     switching rate is even worse than it sounds  that   s because around three quarters of switchers       are moving between fixed price tariffs  not away from the expensive standard variable tariffs  svts  that are the crux of the problem in other words  there   s a group of switchers who move from deal to deal and a group of non switchers who languish on expensive tariffs year after year  with little movement between the two  as a result  only around one in five       of those on expensive svts         those who could save the most         are switching every three years  compared to     of those on fixed rate tariffs this helps explain why switching rates are so low among precisely the groups that can least afford to pay too much  older people  disabled people  private renters  and those on low to middle incomes  nearly     of britain   s elderly  disabled and low income households say they haven   t switched in the last three years  and that explains why  even now     million households         a staggering two thirds of all customers         remain on a standard tariff with one of the big six it   s clear  then  that the energy market is delivering bad overall outcomes for consumers  but bad outcomes alone don   t justify policy interventions  for that  we   d need to believe there   s something systematic going wrong  not just a series of poor consumer decisions  but something stuck in the market itself to see why this might be the case  it   s important to remember exactly why switching matters  clearly switching keeps companies on their toes as they compete for switching customers  but it   s also important that companies don   t know who the switchers are  this is why switching is so fantastically powerful in consumer markets  and it   s why you don   t need      of people to switch for a market to operate well  for each switcher  there   s a wider doubt in a company   s mind  who might be next  that means companies have to treat every customer well  offering them a good service at a competitive price the dynamics in britain   s energy market are the worst of both these worlds  not only are switching rates low but  because of consumer behaviour and the growing power of big data  energy companies also know with increasing precision who will and who won   t switch  that   s why  importantly  you don   t need to assume a single bad motive on the part of energy companies to believe they might be charging people too much  after all  if your customers will stay with you even if you raise prices  why wouldn   t you put prices up it   s when you add these facts together that you get the prices we see in the energy market today  below is one chart that gets a lot of discussion  it shows recent trends in the wholesale price of energy compared with the retail price  this is one of many ways to cut this data and a chart like this hides lots of complexities  with disagreements on both sides  whichever way you cut it  there   s something wrong with the link between the wholesale and retail price figure    energy wholesale and retail price index over timbut it   s the second chart below that speaks more clearly to the market   s particular failings  there   s a large and growing gap in how much suppliers charge for their cheapest tariff and how much they charge for their expensive svt deals that   s the market   s dynamics in action  companies charge less to customers who switch back and forth and much more when they know a customer won   t leave  likewise  they charge less as an entry price  when customers are paying close attention  and much more a year or two later when a customer has their eye off the ball figure    standard energy tariffs compared to the best fixed pricwhy isn   t competition in the market solving this  after all  the number of suppliers in britain   s domestic energy market has exploded in recent years  with over    players now competing  albeit not in every region  undeniably this competition has brought huge upsides  there is more choice on offer  challenging bigger players to raise their game  nor should we ignore the benefits of companies like price comparison websites  or intermediaries like flipper or voltz  offering one click or even automated switching  these innovations have huge potential to disrupt the market in consumers    favour the trouble is  the one thing all this competition is not disrupting is the basic game being played  cheap deals for those who notice and overpriced deals for everyone else  in some cases  we   re even seeing suppliers now denying their cheapest deals to loyal customers  reserving savings for new customers only that   s why the chart above shows the gap between fixed deals and standard tariffs growing even as competition ostensibly becomes more intense  and it   s also why we see such large and persistent differences in this gap between suppliers  the cma found that the average gap between a supplier   s cheapest deal and their svt is around       while the highest is        in a well functioning consumer market a gap like that wouldn   t be sustainable  in the energy market it persists for a simple reason  people don   t really choose to be on a standard tariff  and  even for those who do switch  the price of the standard tariff doesn   t feature highly  if at all  in their switching decision there   s a good case  then  for thinking that the energy market   s failures won   t be solved by competition alone  at least as the market is operating today  but does that justify a bolder approach  particularly so soon after a major investigation by the competition and markets authority it   s certainly important not to downplay the strengths of the cma study  it was a thorough investigation  showing the deep expertise of that organisation and presenting a robust account of the market and its many problems  it was run on the basis of open  formal processes  bringing industry along  and  in doing so  it focused minds on the aspects of the market that are most problematic  concluding with a series of reasonable changes to improve market outcomes will it solve the problems outlined above  there are two reasons it might not on its own  one  the cma   s boldest proposal was a welcome cap on the prices paid by people with pre pay energy meters  this is a bold step which will cut bills significantly for millions of households  particularly on low incomes  but the measure isn   t trying to solve the problem of expensive standard tariffs  nor help those lower income credit customers that are least likely to switch two  the cma   s wider recommendations are either incremental  for example  a database to support marketing to non switchers  or they   re focused mostly on further competition over cheap deals  for example  allowing more tariffs to be created and ending whole of market requirements on pcws   it   s important that these changes are implemented quickly and well  but few people would claim that they will solve the bigger problem of the svt on their own finally  for this government in particular  there   s a good reason to seek a bigger solution to this problem  bringing down energy bills is a good way to help low to middle income households   or  in the pm   s words  families that are    just getting by    that   s because spending on energy is unusually flat across the income distribution  something that   s not the case for all types of spending  for goods like clothes  electronics  or food  for example  richer households spend far more than low to middle income households  so bringing down prices benefits them more  energy spending  by contrast  is relatively similar by income  aside from small variations like green tariffs  there   s no taste the difference energy  and  however much money you earn  there   s a point when your house is just too hot  more than this  some households  such as those with poor insulation or those with caring responsibilities  spend more on energy precisely because they   re struggling financially or have other demands in their lives that explains why a reduction in energy prices helps the bottom half of households the most  the chart below shows this  modelling the impact of an indicative    cut in energy bills on households across the income spectrum  even a flat cut like this would target low to middle income households as a percentage of household income  in practice  it wouldn   t be hard to target a cut even better than this  for example on groups  including older people and disabled people  that haven   t switched in years this all makes cuts to energy prices a more targeted way of helping struggling households than reductions in other prices         and far better than policies like higher tax allowances  which  for a range of other reasons  lean even more starkly toward those in the top half  more generally  for this reason and others  there   s a case for saying that energy in particular  and consumer policy in general  has been something of a blindspot in our living standards debate figure    impact of    cut in energy prices by household incomall of which is a long way to say yes  there   s good reason to believe that britain   s energy market is broken in some basic respects  and yes  this does seem to be an area where the right intervention  carefully made  could help consumers strike a better deal i write on public policy and economics  with a particular
