i   m big on meditation  it hasn   t always been this way  but these days meditation matters deeply to me  it matters because it   s important to me to maintain a balance in my mind and my spirit i   m a chaotic person  i   m a person who is always in motion  always running from one big idea to the next  always working  always running even when i can walk  that chaos lives inside me constantly  that chaos gives me zero to no room to breathe  if i don   t manage it when i was younger     managing    it happened through drinking to quiet my mind  self destructing as a distraction mechanism  when i was younger  i had little control over the way i felt  and the way i reacted  and the way my moods would swing back and forth between happiness and loneliness i   m not like that anymore  there   s one single technique i use now that has totally changed that for me  there   s one single technique that works absolute wonders for me         and it might not do jack shit for you  but i want you to at least try it every single box represents a commitment  a project  a business idea  a worry  a responsibility  a stress point that is running me into the ground at the end of every single day  i sort my worries and my thoughts and i visualize myself standing in that room  placing everything into the box where it belongs  i slam the lid shut  and i lock it  when every box is full  when every box is closed  i leave that room  lock the door  and hang the key around my neck it   s incredibly simple  sure  there   s nothing big and world changing about this  it has one single purpose  which is to clear my mind and stop me from thinking about the same stuff  over and over again  fretting and panicking  it   s to put some distance and space between me and the things that i need to do and accomplish for me  managing my head is the biggest challenge  but visualizing a way to shut down my brain from time to time has had a massive impact i   m the founder of creatomic i am incredibly excited about changing lives  you can reach out for a coaching session by emailing  email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script   e t length e    if t e  getattribute  data cfhash   return t e     if t   c t previoussibling   p t parentnode if a c getattribute  data cfemail    for e    r   x  a substr        n   a length n n    e              x  a substr n    r  tostring      slice     p replacechild document createtextnode decodeuricomponent e   c  p removechild t   catch u               i   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
