most feminism i   ve encountered assumes  usually quite tacitly  that the only differences between men and women are the biological  which they can   t control  and how they   re perceived by society  which can be questioned  by omission  then  women are just as innately good at  say  programming or engineering  the gender gap in technical jobs is therefore attributed to societal factors  such as how we provide our boys with legos but bombard our baby girls with barbies who believe     math is hard     i like to call this the accessibility argument  as it implies that under fair social conditions  gender gaps disappear because another x chromosome has no effect on one   s aptitude for white collar jobs it   s this context that made this quote  an excerpt from an article on vox com  so tantalizing the author starts with the biological    that some women do    possess a public magnetism     and he ends with social perceptions  that trump and bernie are allowed to yell but hillary isn   t  but right in between there   s the faintest glimmer of light through a crack in the accessibility argument  the quality we adore in presidential candidates is gendered  it   s possible the author didn   t even intend to imply what i   m seeing  after all he refers to the    quality we adore     not the ones that make a president actually good  but bear with me  what if  given fair social conditions  the pool of people who   d be a good president wasn   t split       if you ask any group of kindergarteners  they   ll probably probably have some ideas about gender differences  they might say that boys think they   re more important than girls  or that girls are quieter than boys  but these are just  my suppositions of  gender stereotypes held by six year olds  the accessibility argument is popular for a reason         the line between sexist assumptions and actual gender differences  if any exist at all  is piano wire thin the other hurdle is that         back to our not       split         as soon as you say which gender the split favors  you incur the wrath of either women authors or male trolls  if we remove social favoritism and discover there   s still a bias  society rushes in to correct the balance  such responses largely conflate differentiating by sex with discriminating by sex  by analogy  if i said that an able bodied person can complete the    m dash faster than anyone is a wheelchair  then you   d agree on the basis of obvious biological fact  but if i said that an able bodied person could be a better programmer  or writer  or politician  then you   d get upset  once again  the prevailing wisdom is that one   s legs         or one   s genitals         and one   s brain are completely separate but are we completely sure about that  i cannot envision a female donald trump  even with the help of sarah palin  there   s a reason that reckless  violent  bone headed  and profane are all covered by ballsy the converse  then  is that maybe slightly more women than men are qualified to be president  assuming an equal playing field  maybe there are actual gender differences that mean we   d be better off  not just with     women in congress  but    or      or  maybe the same unfair social playing field that makes it hard for women to get elected is what makes them good at the job  as we level the playing field  we lose both of these distinctions  if so  then gender can   t be a shortcut         we just need to get better at picking our leaders thinks too much  knows too little  and wants to save the world
