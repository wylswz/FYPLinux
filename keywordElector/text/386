i   m sick of low energy  nausea  and non stop coughing this week  so  in lieu of me feeling like a gross blob  filled with self pity  i   m just going to complain a bit i   m sick of this campaign  trump  and the excuses being made for him  i can   t even go there right now  but the people who read my stuff on here can imagine what i   m feeling  i   m kind of avoiding social media for those reasons i   m sick of the fact that no matter how hard i try  at home or when i turn on the t v   i am endlessly reminded about the day i was raped  apparently i don   t have the luxury of forgetting it this year   i   m sick of the fact that i keep everyone i love at arm   s length  or farther i   m sick of the terror and fear i have around intimacy  and the fact that i don   t even put effort into my marriage anymore i   m sick of my intense anxiety and irritability  either medication or ptsd  induced  i   m sick of not having the answers as to which one it is i   m sick of the need to have everything perfect all the time  and feeling out of control when there are perceived imperfections i   m sick of counting calories and watching what i eat and feeling guilty for not following my stupid food rules  i   m sick of the fact that i   ve been ignoring my disordered eating for months as a problem  and yet i have no desire to change  especially because i   m not super ill like i used to be i   m sick of feeling lonely  even though most of the time  all i want to do is be alone i   m sick of working on myself and going to therapy  and yet i feel at a loss of what to do when i   m not  i feel stagnant and burnt out at the same time i   m sick of the pressure i repeatedly put on myself  and the fact that although i pretend this isn   t the case  i never feel good enough i   m sick of the fear that i live in constantly  and the things i do to forget it i   m sick of holding it all in  i   ve got people that support me  but a lifetime of willful independence to undo i   m sick of juggling everything  i want a week where i don   t have to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders i   m sick of the guilt  just a lot of guilt  about a lot of things i   m sick of having writer   s block  i haven   t really been on here in a few weeks and i feel so distant from myself  from you guys  and from my writing    i don   t know if it   s a lack of desire to write  related to my depression  or i feel without passion right now  but every time i get on here  there   s just so many words  it   s overwhelming  it could subconsciously be related to all the nonstop trolling that was happening a month ago  who knows   i do miss medium  though  i   m going to try to get back into the swing of things  because lord knows i am happier when i   m writing  if you read this  congratulations  and apologies for the whiny attitude and if it doesn   t make much sense  i   m that kind of sick where you are super foggy and have to re read everything   times  also  i need to be transparent and say that i am not looking for sympathy  i think i just needed to write it down and have a few people bear witness to it  my heart feels a little lighter now  at least i know i will be okay  i always am  surviving is easy    it   s the living part that   s hard writer  teacher    dog mom  when i m not on here i manage   edit the blog for a mental health organization called where i stand
