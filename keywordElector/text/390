these days  we   ve got a handful of strong  female characters in our fictional arsenal    but many are still rooted in sexual plot devices or expounding on child producing woes  sometimes they are gifted with a plot that doesn   t directly pertain to their relative sex appeal  but even then it   s often because they are one of many    she   s an odd girl and that   s what makes her beautiful    tropes  see  manic pixie dream girl  of all the things about women on tv that could grind my gears  what really irks me is that none of these women seem to menstruate i mean  many of them get pregnant so therefore they must be having periods   but off screen  relegated to other acts of womanly witchery that shall never be seen it occurs to me that for most women  their periods come and go relatively unnoticed  they   re a minor annoyance that midol can usually tame  but for many of us    in    conservatively of we   re talking about endometriosis one of many conditions that causes dysmenorrhea  our monthly    or mostly monthly sometimes bimonthly or   weeks in a row  who knows anymore    period impacts our day to day lives in ways that a little tylenol can   t fix in fact for many women  narcotics don   t even touch the pain of all the fictional female characters in circulation  do you mean to tell me that not one of them         is one of us we constantly hear the same rhetoric about women on their periods  they   re dysfunctional  emotional  irrational  menstruation is our lot in life  que sera sera in reality  we   ve normalized this suffering to the point where women appear to thrive in spite of it  they perform  they mother  they are lovers and bosses and carpool queens  they suffer in silence because that   s what they   ve been taught  that   s the expectation and all these conveniently amenorrheic female characters just further the cultural perception that we shouldn   t talk about our periods that no one cares not even those who are having them you know who probably has terrible periods meredith grey maybe she didn   t always  but with all the stress in her life i would bet serious money that she   s got severe dysmenorrhea that she   s been forced to ignore  despite the fact that she   s a medical professional herself not that i want to saddle her with more misery  since she   s had a pretty miserable fictional life  but somewhere in that alternate universe of memorial grey sloan there must be scenes of meredith grey clutching a hot water bottle to her abdomen while her kids fuss in the next room  maybe she   s vomiting from the pain  or having diarrhea in the middle of the night  maybe she has to lock herself in an on call room  clutching a cold metal instrument tray as cramps tear through her         as bad as labor pain  but lacking the validation of childbearing how many times has she  or cristina or izzy or arizona  bled through their flimsy scrubs  how could one not  standing up in an or for      hours            also  how do surgical residents not get tss  all those locker room sequences where they   re openly talking sex could have also been used to discuss menstruation  at the very least i   m sure cristina and mer   s cycles had synced up  okay  i admit that the mcclinktock effect hasn   t been vetted in scientific literature  but almost everyone i   ve met has experienced this at one time or another if they   ve lived with other women  what we didn   t see in the day to night to day lives of seattle grace   s interns  its residents and its promising young doctors  were the exchanges of emergency tampons  the nausea inducing cramps  the double pad and a tampon days of heavy flows that threatened to put the kibosh on mcsexytimes sure  we got some pregnancy scares  some    i   m late    tropes  we had some conversations about women   s health issues in the form of patients  of fertility struggles         and grey   s anatomy  being a medical drama  was perfectly positioned to make menstruation second nature on screen blood   guts being its thing  after all what with the six episode revival of my all time favorite show  and thus  my all time favorite fictional female  i couldn   t possibly write a piece like this without theorizing about the state of fbi agent   medical doctor dana scully   s uterus if you   re even vaguely familiar with the sci fi drama         either from the original nine seasons or the fresh tenth   you   ll remember that scully was abducted  rendered barren  then miraculously conceived a child with fox mulder  her fbi partner and   confirmed bae   so  yeah  she   s got a pretty interesting reproductive history to begin with  to me  the real conspiracy is how the hell did she spend ten of her most fertile years chasing aliens with mulder without ever asking him to stop at a rest stop somewhere outside of tulsa so that she could get tampons          i   m sure it was at least partially to do with the fact that i was  ob sessed  with this show for practically my entire adolescence  but these were things that i did earnestly think about  would it have really made scully less of a badass if she menstruated  in the predominantly male bullpen of the fbi  would her period be just another reason to josh her  to claim she was the weaker sex and therefore couldn   t perform the job as well  despite the fact that she kept pace with mulder  doing everything he did and in high heels the only thing that would have made me more impressed with scully would have been to see her tackling government conspiracies  chasing were monsters through deep woods and keeping herself from strangling mulder while having killer cramps and trying to find a convenient time to change her tampon during a heated interrogation scully set the stage for fictional badass  crime fighting gals on tv  one being svu   s olivia benson  who is arguably the best positioned character on tv to have really stark conversations about menstruation  often dealing with victims of sexual abuse and exploitation  benson is the sex positive character that we need not just in these situations  but in the more global scheme where real women are being victimized every day benson   s seemingly contrarian empathy   toughness is one of the things that makes her one of the most compelling  and realistically complex  female characters on television  the struggle is real for women everywhere who feel that getting emotionally invested in situations is mutually exclusive to being    a tough nut to crack     olivia benson is proof that these traits coexist  often in a symbiosis of emotional resiliency something tells me that if asked  benson wouldn   t hesitate to talk about her preference for the diva cup         all the while advocating for young women to explore their menstrual sanitation  though i loathe that word  options and realizing that they don   t necessarily have to be committed to one for their entire life  their lives will change and so too will their period needs give me a five minute sequence with benson explaining to a young woman who is recovering from sexual abuse and isn   t comfortable with tampons anymore that she has every right to start using menstrual pads  cups or whatever she discovers she   s most comfortable with maybe she   s interviewing a young woman who  upon taking a break  realizes she   s started her period and she   s unprepared  you can   t tell me that benson wouldn   t take a tampon from her personal stash to give to the girl  in fact  she   s probably got a stash of all nature of period products and she   d ask the girl what her preferences are first i   ve actually written about this before  sort of  but despite my love of downton abbey  one thing that has always made me chuckle is the reality of the crawley girls and their most beautiful gowns when downton starts  it   s              so  end of the victorian era  but only just  and the beginning of the edwardian era which was defined by rose dewitt bukater esque hats  the fashion of the era was  for upperclass women anyway  lavish and extraordinary      marked the end of la belle epoque  but many of those styles continued on a few more years         and the corset persisted even longer  continuing to evolve seemingly of its own volition the truth about these gorgeous gowns  though  was that the women who wore them routinely bled straight into their petticoats and chemises rural women  and those who worked for a living  did often attempt to pad up their underthings to absorb menstrual blood         and the only demographic of women who were actually using rudimentary menstrual pads were those employed as actresses  dancers and performers the    theatrical tampon    wouldn   t get its heyday until the      s and      s  but the concept made sense  tamponettes were highly absorbent  had no irritating deodorants and were sterilized still  upperclass women and socialites wandered through their grand manor homes and ballrooms in their finest jewels  all the while having bled into their chemises for days in a row without changing them  and when they did  well  they certainly weren   t going to be the ones to clean it up  that would have been tasked to their lady   s maid it makes sense that at least in the upstairs scenes of downton  anything as scandalous as menstruation would never have be spoken of  but i   d think  especially in the earlier seasons when sharp tongued lady   s maid sarah o   brien ruled the roost downstairs  we could have been treated to at least a few gripes and groans about her ladyship   s soiled bloomers in later seasons  the relationship between lady and lady   s maid is further defined as a conspiring one when mary requests that anna procure her some birth control          which was far more scandalous than getting her period actually  it would have been far more interesting to talk about how the women in service handled their menstrual cycles  often working     hour days    in shared living quarters  no less         the menstrual lives of those women would have been far more varied and complex in fact  many young girls entered service as scullery maids when they were eleven  twelve or thirteen and the average age for starting your period was much older than it is today         closer to fifteen  sixteen and seventeen many of the young women working downstairs at downton probably started their periods during their employment there and may never have received    the talk     more than likely it would have fallen to an older maid or even the housekeeper to make sure the girl knew not just about proper hygiene  but the implications of menstruating  namely  that she   d become a fertile being seemingly overnight and that getting pregnant would most certainly end with her employment being terminated on downton  the one maid who experienced this fate became a    fallen woman     read  a prostitute  as a direct result of her unintended pregnancy although  during this period in history germ theory was gaining significant traction and many doctors assumed that periods were gross and potentially disease spreading  the early models of menstrual sanitation         the closest thing that the crawley ladies would have had         were cumbersome devices that were probably intimidating enough to adult women  let alone young girls who were often working long hours in factories or manor homes when you look at the options  it   s really not all that surprising that most women opted to use nothing at all  especially if they had a lady   s maid perhaps the tome of sexuality in the downton abbey age was marie stopes    married love  which makes brief mention of menstruation as it pertains to a woman   s fertility  and to differentiate between    menstruation    and    period of desire    of course  even if the ladies of downton abbey were to discuss menstruation  it would have been shrouded in euphemisms  as most things were at that time in history  or  used to warrant a proper diagnosis of hysteria  since menstruation was directly linked to a woman   s mental wellness lady mary  then  may have avoided a trip to a    nice swiss sanitarium    by making no qualms about her period         or  in the hush hush of her room  merely mention in passing to anna that she   s    not quite well    on account of her    monthlies    lest she wind up with the nickname bloody mary if you   d like to contribute  be interviewed or help spread the word  check out the ask me about my uterus guidelines  then email the editors or tweet
