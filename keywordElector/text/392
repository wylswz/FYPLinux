when we think of novels  of newspapers and blogs  we think of words  we easily forget the little suggestions pushed in between  the punctuation  but how can we be so cruel to such a fundamental part of writing inspired by a series of posters  i wondered what did my favorite books look like without words  can you tell them apart or are they all a mush  in fact  they can be quite distinct  take my all time favorite book  absalom  absalom  by william faulkner  it is dense prose stuffed with parentheticals  when placed next to a novel with more simplified prose         blood meridian  by cormac mccarthy         it is a stark difference  see above  yes  the contrast is stark  but the wild mix of symbols can be beautiful  too  look at the array of dots and dashes above  this morse code is both meaningless and yet so meaningful  we can look and say  brief sentence  description  shorter description  action  action  action want to see more  i have a few posters of books up on a page on my blog and the code is freely available here  why not print out all of the punctuation of pride and prejudice and cover your walls as i mentioned above  the difference between these novels is stark  look at the contribution of each type of punctuation blood meridian is short sentences  a question or two  maybe  but then more sentences  and yet absalom  absalom  is wild  moreover  one might say  it is statements  within statements  within statements  who doesn   t love that here is a comparison of some other books         notice how large a break a farewell to arms was from the past  there almost no commas  just sentences  dialogue  how refreshing and wild that must have been  look at how spartan blood meridian is compared to everything  pay attention to the semicolons which seem to have disappeared from writing punctuation does more than simply carve out a space for words  it separates them  clearly  some authors are more okay with long rambling sentences than others  william faulkner looks at your short sentences and says nothing less than fuck you and yet these sentences are made up of smaller clauses  faulkner is not actually much of an outlier compared to other novels  the difference between a hemingway and a mccarthy is the dispensation of quotation marks  when the warm  curling hands of the quotation is gone the reader is left with a broader sense of space writing can be beautiful because of the words an author chooses to use  but it can also be beautiful because of the choice of punctuation update  at brian b    s suggestion  i transformed the punctuation into a heatmap  periods and question marks and exclamation marks are red  commas and quotation marks are green  semicolons and colons are blue  i   m just going to lay these out here without further comment   social neuroscience  decision making  machine learning  ecology  economics
