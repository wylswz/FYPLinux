in    the return of europe   s nation states     september october       foreign affairs   jakub grygiel argues that post european union nation states    would do a better job of checking russia  managing the migrant crisis  and combating terrorism on their own than they have done under the auspices of the eu     his unspoken goal of putting a positive spin on an admittedly tumultuous period in the eu   s life is noble  and i   ll be the first to say that the eu is a very difficult and complex institution to fully understand  but giddily writing off the union as already dead     as the union dissolves        served to relegate the piece to the very pile of eurosceptic and right wing rhetoric that he talks about so much in his essay  rest assured  the european union will survive its current    crisis     any claims to the otherwise are either unfounded or severely confused to be fair  being a eurocrat these days is not easy  and the continent does face many serious problems  but is this actually the    worst     most threatening  most existential     political crisis since world war ii     grygiel has seized recentism         the phenomenon of putting an excessive amount of importance behind recent events         as a tool to support his argument  for example  terrorism is often cited  by grygiel and others  as a sudden and new danger to european citizens    security  but instances of terror on the continent are hardly new  and are actually considerably lower now than they were in the     s     s when basque separatist group eta and the troubles in ireland continuously made headlines for terror  spain  ireland  and the united kingdom were eu members during this  and the union survived that grygiel spends much of his essay on security  and laments the eu   s inability to adequately address this  in this respect  he has conflated the european union with nato  its alter ego sibling organization comprised of mostly the same members  it is obvious that he respects the latter more than the former  as his concluding wish is that the eu   s death breathes fresh life into nato  but his criticism in the eu   s defense policies fall flat because of the structural design of the union  this is to say that the eu   s lack of a hard security component like nato was an intentional decision         not a mistake  european union member states realized that any efforts to establish a non american version of nato would fail because nato simply wasn   t going anywhere  what   s the point of dedicating national resources to maintaining two international bureaucracies that essentially do the same thing  so the european union   s members have more or less decided that anything related to defense is the prerogative of nato and not the eu  at least for now meanwhile grygiel claims     the european states that border russia have found little reassurance in the union  which explains why they have sought the help of nato and u s  forces     he is probably referring to poland   s      invocation of nato   s article   and repeated anxious cries from the baltic states  these cries fall to the ears of nato not because other european countries don   t care within the eu sphere  but because the venue for caring about defense specifically already eagerly exists at nato  if he were to give credit where it is due  grygiel should be proud that the eu has tried to integrate natoesque policies where it can         for example  the      lisbon treaty included a collective defense clause  art        that acts identically to nato   s famous article   in his talking on security  grygiel dedicates several paragraphs to the euromaidan crisis in ukraine which he perceives as a major failure for the eu  this analysis of the event is quite a bit different than most versions  though the annexation of crimea can be seen as a failure of international sanctions and ineffective negotiations  this is by no means the eu   s fault exclusively  in fact  the european union is often seen as the big winner of euromaidan  for pr reasons if nothing else  euromaidan gave the european project an unexpected stage for european ideals and european nationalism to play out  flags of the european union abounded and were flown with as much pride as ukrainian flags  the important part of this         and the part that grygiel never mentions         is that ukraine is not a member of the eu nor nato  nato   s defense clauses were never triggered  and nato did not act against russia during euromaidan  so why is grygiel mad that the eu didn   t  ukrainians used the eu as a symbol of a happier and more successful future for the nation  more    western    and more progressive than its still memorable soviet history  ukrainian revolutionaries vocally aspired to the governmental transparency and free movement of persons and ideas that the eu prides itself in  the complex nature of russian irredentism and its half successes in that respect aside  euromaidan gave the eu and its members a reason to be proud of themselves and their union since defense  fiscal  and border security were policies that the eu member states did not want to give up sovereignty on  how could we say that the eu has been a failure in those areas  it failed only because its member states designed it in an ineffective way  this is like being angry with your egg poacher for not scrambling eggs too  the areas where the union has failed have often resulted in legislative change that amends the policies and improves the responsiveness of the union  the migration crisis prompted the october         evolution of ineffective frontex into the european border and coast guard  the revamped agency of double the staff and triple the budget has centralized command of border patrol from the member state level to the european level  and is being hailed as    game changer    for eu border security  likewise  the sovereign debt crisis prompted several proposals for long term policy changes including the establishment of a european fiscal union  much like the titanic   s sinking served as a catalyst for maritime safety policy creation  each of the eu   s crises have given the union much more help than pain  as they have exposed integration policy areas needing to be fixed grygiel is writing in the wake of the united kingdom   s vote to leave the eu  which he calls    a stunning blow to the bloc     while i   m not sure he is qualified to be the voice of opinion for the eu   s     million citizens  he is not wrong to say it was a shock and surprise  he says the vote         which was much more nationally polarized than the uk wide         score he reports  was a rebuke of a failing eu  but  he says     the support for brexit in the united kingdom       was less an expression of hostility toward other european countries than it was an assertion of the united kingdom   s right to self govern     he says this was patriotism  not nationalism  i disagree  the four nations of the united kingdom voted markedly differently than each other  with scotland and northern ireland voting staunchly pro eu  and england and wales voting staunchly anti eu  hate crimes against eastern europeans have risen dramatically since the vote  and a stew of xenophobia and pure english superiority has emerged in the chaos that has followed  will the eu survive brexit  absolutely  i happen to think the uk   s future is less clear grygiel   s criticisms of the european union are valid  to be sure  there is without a doubt a massive democratic deficit that needs to be addressed  building a european nation is far easier said than done  and a surge of xenophobic sentiments will need to be squashed before more integration can be undertaken in earnest  the lisbon treaty was a major improvement on the eu before that  and i should expect that the these will be among the major areas to improve with the next treaty i agree with grygiel that nations are becoming more relevant within the eu         for instance  during a trip to barcelona last year  i observed that the noticeable absence of spanish flags was more than filled by catalan separatist flags flying next eu flags  but do small nations honestly hope that the eu collapses around them  certainly not  just ask scotland  the eu isn   t going anywhere  by working toward improving the eu rather than fantasizing about its death  europe will be able to meet its most pressing challenges the way it has since world war ii         through unity in diversity editor  case in pointe  will talk ad nauseam on foreign policy  europhile a new kind of study lounge
