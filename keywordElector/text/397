as we have explained in our former article uberization  nope  platformization  the economy is structured around organizations whose roles are to design  produce  assemble  distribute  sell or consume goods and services in this model  the unidirectional approach is predominant  value is created by a tunnel of sequenced actions  the digital world has allowed the elimination of certain sequences as well as the incorporation of a new tool  the platform  in the value creation chain  platforms are open intermediary interfaces through which suppliers and customers meet  the two sides may exchange goods  eg  amazon  but it can be other types of transactions  like social interactions  eg  facebook  daphni is convinced that the vc model is going to change and has decided to become the first vc as a platform as explained in our recent article    why daphni is the first vc as a platform     sometimes  you just have to choose between being disrupted or disrupting  we   d prefer the secondary the platform model makes it possible to be more efficient and relevant on every step of the vc value chain      access the best opportunities      select the good deals      be chosen by quality founders      optimize scale and     ensure best funding   exit options  let   s see first how the platform can help us with the first three parts in aspect of the deal flow generation      platforms favor an increase in number of geographic markets addressed and in number of investment opportunities received  daphni increases its reach capacity of the hub it targets including paris  berlin  london  stockholm  copenhagen  helsinki and amsterdam in aspect of the deal flow management      the platform enhances the review process and reduces the delay between the reception of an opportunity  the first review of it  the feedback made to the entrepreneurs and the potential launch of an in depth instruction  this amplification of deal flow sourcing is further supported by the possibility of reaching a wider public due to the brand platform and new usages  which it makes possible  this also makes entrepreneurs all the more incentivized to choose our funding offer     to benefit fully from the advantages and power of a platform  the network effect is essential  the more contributors the platform has  the bigger the value offer is  for example  the value of the service offered by blablacar increases simultaneously with the number of active members on the platform  at daphni  we have not limited the use of our platform to our team and deal flow companies but we have opened it to our community of talents and experts as well as to our investors and the entrepreneurs of our portfolio companies  we call them the daphnipolitans  we have aligned interests  since either they are investors in our fund or they are backed up by our fund our objective is to offer the best service to our customers through the features of our platform with our platform we are not a team of    people to help our entrepreneurs to scale  we are a community of     talented people willing to transfer and share their knowledge and network as well as to invest along us in deals in the platform economy  value moves around  the enhancement of interactions supplants the value of assets  uber owns no vehicles  airbnb does not possess real estate  facebook produces no content this new development model  freed from the problematic of financing infrastructures  has made a rapid jump in scale as well as rapid internationalization possible  platforms like kickstarter  for example  are built to offer a unified service across countries  with marginal and decreasing costs  what they are betting on is their ability to pull in the greatest number of buyers and sellers at daphni  the funds raised to be invested in the portfolio companies remain essential but we think that it is not enough if we want to have access to the best deals  this is why we are betting on our platform  we didn   t just build a dealflow management tool  we are improving it overtime both for entrepreneurs and lps  adding features  adding people into the community  adding services  we   ve decided to lower our paychecks but to invest  as every ambitious entrepreneur does the secret of    platformization    rests on a change in the paradigm  which requires a considerable effort of open mindedness and willingness to question established principles  the customer becomes the supplier  your competition becomes your customer  users develop commercial relations among themselves  the user becomes both the producer and the consumer  it requires to be very transparent  it means that the value does not rely exclusively on the information you own but in the power of the ecosystem and the quality of the execution of the service from an insular or individualist approach  we promote a collaborative and open practice where pollination between all players of the ecosystem benefits eachother many sectors have already been disrupted  music  hospitality  distribution  travel  media  transport  etc  all markets could potentially be    platformized     from the most improbable  like politics  to the most conservative  like education  the more established industry  eg  finance  are starting to be platformize  indeed  even in finance  we observe a decrease of level of intermediation and the the emergence of digital innovative services that create new usage or take market share to traditional players this movement is also making inroads in the financing of startups with the crowdfunding platforms like angellist or kickstarter as well as the penetration of diverse players which syndicates deals  most often still manually  at daphni we are convinced that we are on the edge of major changes for the way the vc industry is going to be organized  also because of this vision and a paradoxical lack of digitalization of our business  we invest in digital projects  remember   we have decided to develop our home made platform the main objective of our platform is for sure to bring happiness to its users  but particularly to have a value proposition that fits both lps   s and entrepreneurs    expectations  they are our customers  we have to serve them the way they deserve it that   s it  this is the story of our mutation into the first vc as a platform  we are the first one  innovation does not last very long in the digital world  we are impatient to discover platforms from other vcs  we will cross fertilize ideas to improve the value proposition of our industry vc  co founder   partner  daphnipolidaphni chronicles shares lessons learned and analyses from daphnipolis  the great community around the venture fund daphni  it   s like having private talks with high level thinkers   doers of the tech world
