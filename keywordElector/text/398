this is a follow up post to our point nine predictions for      and dives deeper into my   digital marketplace predictions for      prediction     disaggregwhen it comes to digital marketplaces  we at point nine are observing a long term trend that some call the    disaggregation    or    fragmentation    of horizontally structured marketplaces into dedicated  vertically structured platforms  already back in       andrew parker of spark capital wrote a great piece titled    the spawn of craigslist    about his observations on the    unbundling of craigslist     a must read     history has shown that online marketplaces went through   major development steps from being rather passive to becoming more integrated and    active    our strong belief is that the trend of moving into the transaction and becoming more specialized and thus    vertical    persists and will continue to evolve prediction     ubertoday  this trend is reinforced by the    uberization    of marketplaces  or better        of everything      everything shifts online and becomes bookable on demand meaning the marketplace strives to    own    the transaction with fully dynamic  demand based prices  e g  surge pricing  resulting in a higher transparency to its users and  most importantly  higher efficiency  on that topic  martin mignot of index ventures recently published an interesting piece about his view on the on demand economy prediction     saas ifwe also notice that the lines between    saas    and    marketplace    become more and more blurry  as a result of the aforementioned    uberization    and disaggregation  marketplaces need to have very strong  specialized product offerings to both  demand  and supply side users  think uber   s different apps for drivers and passengers or  thumbtack   s different solutions for professionals and end consumers   thus  their products become increasingly    saas ified    i e  features of their product suite could be viable stand alone  saas  applications outside of the marketplace  that means users would be willing to pay for it on a subscription basis because of the value add or efficiency gains they generate in that way  the saas part enhances the entire marketplace experience for both  the supply  and demand side users  and eventually increases the lock in and usability for everyone  as a result  the marketplace could potentially monetize to a higher degree or  it reaches critical mass quicker  due to faster user adoption  and therefore can start to monetize more aggressively earlier in its development a business subject to these dynamics can optimize its monetization in the long term by choosing a transaction based model  a subscription based model  a lead generation model or a mix of all any of them at point nine  we strongly believe that this development will continue throughout       and beyond   we have made several investments in this space in       and before   some of which have yet to be announced  some of which are already disclosed e g as a consequence of the specialization resulting from the disaggregation and    uberization     so many new marketplaces are being created in so many different segments that we   re seeing the rise of a new breed of middlemen services  like e g  magic   these help consumers navigate an ever increasing abundance of on demand services  we believe that this will even accelerate over the next year in       we will continue to look for great teams that are following and refining these trends with the ambition to build global category leaders  please get in touch if you feel this could be you on the dark side of the force  early stage tech vc  pointninecap  previously m a  naspers    ricardo ch  passion for startups  sport  biking  views are my ownstories from the point  team   portfolio compani
