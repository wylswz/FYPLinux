a couple of weeks back the associated press found itself in a thundering turdstorm of criticism after it ran an overcooked but basically legitimate story on hillary clinton  the clinton foundation  the real criticism wasn   t so much over the story but the framing  in particular this tweet the backlash  summarized well by the washington post  largely focused on the fact that the story hinted at pay for play  scandal   but didn   t really have the meat to back it up   and  in particular that the    more than half    was downright misleading because it focused on a small sliver of very specific meetings today  the ap standards police announced that the original tweet is being deleted  instead  the replacement is this along with this little qualifier but o  what a crappy non apology this is  note the twitter card  which basically repeats the same misleading information that got the original tweet deleted  note the fact that it doesn   t say that    of people clinton met with in the period examined also contributed to the foundation  which would have arguably been more accurate   note how it uses the wonkish term    discretionary meetings     which is procedurally more correct   but doesn   t alter the thrust of the message  it   s a perfect work of dark art the issue here is that this is neither really an apology or analysis of an error  it   s just a note that an error was made as any journalist who   s had to write an apology or clarification will admit   although maybe only over a drink  or when they   ve quit their job to go and try their hand at pr or pretend to be a farmer or just gone and hidden in the corner babbling wildly   the reality is that most of the time you are writing an apology you are absolutely trying your hardest not to apologize at all  you   re trying to write a get out that allows you to back out gracefully  or avoid a lawsuit  or get people off your back   while also still feeling kind of ok with yourself  usually this is because you still believe that you   re right  just that you   ve been caught being kind of wrong  sometimes you are right  but it   s nearly always a game of trying to say enough without saying too much  truth is most people who bother to read corrections or clarifications are smart enough to see through this  or they don   t care  so here   s the honest answer  sometimes you fuck a story up from the bottom to the top  other times you screw up the promotion  or you choose a bad headline  or you   re too close to the story to understand that you   re confusing readers but even if we accept that  yes  people make mistakes  the important question is never really whether a mistake was made  it   s why the mistake was made most apologies never deal with that  it   s nearly always some act of god like    editing error    or    deadline pressure     these are both choices  not acts of nature   the reality is usually more venal  and therefore less palatable  we thought we saw a story that nobody else had  we needed the attention  we juiced it  we got some facts wrong  but we know the headline is what people really share or care about or get motivated by  so we were wrong  but we probably knew we were wrong at the same moment we were doing the wrong thing  we just thought we could get away with it for long enough this isn   t to say that there aren   t genuine dumb headed editing errors  or slips made by reading or writing too fast  i   ve been on the receiving end of a few of those  and probably dealt a few out as well   but if we expect the world to be honest with us  we have to be honest back that would probably have been a more honest thing for the ap to say today  but then it would have to admit that it is as desperate for attention as the rest of the media  and that it is just as screwed up about the election as almost everyone else is causing trouble since       editorial  news and curation  medium  cofounder of  readmatter  and many other things along the way
