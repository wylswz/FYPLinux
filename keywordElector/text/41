original interview  http   www techiesproject com rob cascella tell me about your early years and where you come from early years  okay  so i was born into an italian family in connecticut  i am the oldest of three kids  and the oldest cousin of nine  had i gone to college  i would have been the first person in my family to have done so  as i dropped out  for reasons which i   m sure we   ll cover later   i think my sister claimed that title some years later we moved to central new jersey  in between new brunswick and princeton  when i was eight  that   s where i grew up  i have had a computer since i was four  so typing is easily one of my earliest learned skills  i think  of learned skills  i   ve only been walking  talking  running  and whistling longer than i have been typing i did not have very many friends as a kid  i got picked on a lot  and so i kinda went out of my way to avoid unnecessary social interactions where i might be alone  like lunchtime  i would eat my lunch quickly  and then escape to the library where  one day in my freshman year  i found a mac se  sat down  and started playing with it  it was my first exposure to a real personal computer         until then  everything had been glorified video game systems with basic programming interfaces  like c    or ti     a   it just worked for me  by the end of my freshman year  i was teaching the art teachers how to use the scanner and brand new system i had set up for them i tried to do a semester of college after i graduated high school  but it did not go as well as i would have wanted  yanno  growing up  everyone told me i was smart  but i made a very stupid decision about college  i ended up going to purdue university  in indiana  of the schools that accepted me  it was the best option  at least from a recognizable name perspective  but it was a terrible choice if i wanted to finally come out as gay in college  my roommates  and even the resident advisor for our dorm  were all exceptionally straight small town indiana boys  i recall learning three important things during our brief interactions     abortion should not be even a word  let alone an allowable action     women are essentially property of their mans  and    being queer should be illegal  but  since it is not  it should be taken into the hands of  let   s kindly refer to them as  vigilantes so that wasn   t too great for me  it definitely encouraged my continued avoidance of social situations that i couldn   t control  which  ironically  continued to have the effect of exposing me to new technologies  in order to avoid my roommates  i spent all of my free time in the computer labs where i got to play with unix in the forms of early bsd and very early linux  and where i was introduced some very early forms of online chat i should back up here  because  at that point in my life  i imagined myself in a creative role  given that so much of my exposure to systems in high school related in some way to art  i was targeting creative and graphic design as my career  my first job  in between high school and college  was running the desktop publishing department at my local kinko   s  where i networked all the self serve computers    just for the fun of it      so  purdue would have been amazing if i had my sights set on cs  but  yanno   i   m a little slow on the uptake for some things   laughter  so  at the time  all i consciously took from it was a way to access this world of online chat that i had been shown anyway  so i dropped out  i went back home  and looked for temp work         because what the hell else was i going to do  i had that experience in desktop publishing at kinko   s  so i went in search of some entry level design jobs  i figured i could typeset ads or something  it was during an interactive interview for one such job that things changed for me picture it  new york city        a young peasant boy is seated at a computer taking a timed quarkxpress typesetting test  suddenly  the computer  it crashes  oh no  what will the boy do   he takes it all in stride  that   s what he does  he fixes the damn computer  and finishes the test  just in time  returning to the test administrators  he tells them of his troubles with the test taking apparatus  and how he remedied them         just in case it happens again  intrigued  the administrators escort him to another desk  holding another computer  which displays a different test  a technical skills test     would you mind     they ask him  the boy complies  he flies through the test at record speed  when he returns to the administrators  at first  they are crestfallen  he   s back too fast  he must be bailing on the test  buh buh buh    but then they check the results  and their expressions noticeably change     that   s the best score we   ve ever seen anyone get on this test  have you ever considered a job in desktop support    unfortunately  they didn   t have one to offer me  but  it planted the right seed  and  by virtue of the connections i had made via irc         the early form of online chat i previously mentioned         i ended up with a job doing desktop support for american express i jumped around through a number of different jobs in new york city  ultimately landing at an ad agency where  at    years old  i held the very fancy sounding role    manager of it services            which really meant that i was the only person in the company who knew anything at all about tech  they were an all mac shop  but it was mine to run as i wanted  so i used the available hardware to teach myself linux  the first time i installed linux myself was linuxppc  installed onto a jaz cartridge connected to a powerbook       there   s some serious geek cred in that  i   m just sayin    once i had taught myself linux  i was able to apply for actual sysadmin jobs  and so i eventually did that  and landed with the scifi channel   s    new media    division  remember when it was called    new media      as a junior linux system administrator  this was really cool  it was the end of       beginning of       when  if you recall  the vc money was flowing like the nile         i mean  it was just pouring out of the walls  i actually remember them telling us that we had to spend money  so we went out and bought an aibo  do you remember the aibo nope it was this robot dog that sony made wait i do remember yea  it was         okay  at a time when my rent was       at a time when a nice apartment on the upper west side would have been like         we had an aibo  because we had to spend our money  it was fucking insane anyway  i kinda saw the writing on the wall that that was unsustainable  and i had been circulating my resume  and it ended up with this company in san mateo  here i am         it was       so i was about to turn            i   m    years old  i   m talking to a company in california  i   m a grunt  i   m a peon  i figure these people are never going to hire me  anyway  and even if they do  i can   t afford to move myself to no california  so i just treated the interviews super super casual  and  after a few rounds on the phone  they were like     yea  so do you want to come out and meet us     do i want you to pay for me to fly to san francisco and put me in a hotel for the weekend  um  fuck yea i want that  i figure that   s all i   m ever gonna get out of it  so yes i definitely want that   laughter so i fly out  they tour me through the office  tell me all about their stuff  this and that  and then  real casual like  the director of engineering says to me     so  what do you think  you want a job     i mean  yea  i want a job  but i mean  i live in new jersey     yea yea yea  we   ll get you here  don   t worry about that  do you want to work here     i mean  yea  yea  i guess  yea     ok  great  how much do you want     wait  what  what are you talking about  aren   t you supposed to tell me how much i   m getting  what do you mean how much do i want  am i on camera  c   mon  this isn   t funny and so that   s how i come to live in california the week i arrived  the guy who hired me         the guy who i know was my advocate to get me in there         got fired  he was replaced by a vp of engineering and operations who brought only political in fighting to the organization  basically all progress was stalled for five months  it got so bad  that the board had to intervene  the ceo was forced to resign  and the vp  and almost everyone within the organizations below the vp  was laid off  they kept their administrative  sales  and marketing departments  the cto  the head dba  and one engineer  everybody else  it was     see you later     i   ve just moved to california six months ago  it   s march        i have six more months on a        month lease uh oh holy shit  laughter   on the upside  at least i don   t have to pay back the relocation costs   laughter  and  again  i think i knew this vp was screwing things up  and so  again  i already had the resume out  i was really lucky  i got a job within two days  i didn   t have to leave  and  yanno  that was a really intense time  it took my peers who were laid off at the same time over a year to find another gig  some of them did have to go back to whatever was home for them  and these were people with more demonstrable experience than i had  so  yea  i count myself really lucky but then that company then failed again about a year later  so now i was really stuck  i was kinda dating  but mostly just living with  a guy at the time whose parents are  basically  rich  his dad was something like the sixth employee  and the primary hardware engineer  for some networking company in the south bay  and they were sending him  literally         a month to go to school and live in san francisco  i can   t even conceive of somebody giving me        every month  just to exist  but here we were  so that money paid our rent  and i got some contract work through friends to bring in money for food  and i enrolled in city college of san francisco so that i could get financial aid to cover the rest now  at the time  we had a friend who was in the hospital battling leukemia  an eighteen year old kid  since i was out of formal work  i got to spend         on reflection not nearly enough         time with him  it was while visiting with him one day that i got the idea maybe i should be a nurse  i thought it would be a really great way to use my empathy to help people in a really vulnerable time and blah  blah  blah i think in some ways that would have been a right path for me  but since i   ve been back in tech  when i look at some of the careless errors that i make  i go     oh  nooooooo     yanno  nobody dies if i fuck up in tech   laughter  but  if i give the wrong person the wrong injection  they   re gonna die  so on reflection  nursing seemed a little scary maybe nursing wasn   t the right choice  but aiming for it kept me in san francisco  i didn   t have to go back to new jersey  and that was really important  for      to       i battled with the ccsf student population for the precious little available space in required classes  since i never did college after high school  i had to start from  yanno  start  so i was doing english and psychology and all that crap  through that whole time  my former manager had been on my ass to come back and work with him again  it took him like    months  but as soon as he landed  he was like     i need you  i need you  i need you     and i   m like     you want me full time  i can   t give you full time  i   m going to school    but then i got to the point where i was like     okay  i can apply to nursing school now     and i knew that i had at least a semester of lag between applying and when i would begin  assuming best case scenario that i was accepted on my first try  which was almost inconceivable   i also knew that the clinical part of my education was going to be more time demanding than the classroom portion had been for these last several years  i knew that meant that i would soon lose that extra money i had been making with my contract work  oh  and that boyfriend with the rich parents  yea  we broke up about eight months into me being at school  so i had been really struggling to hold shit together for a while there  and so  i knew i was gonna need at least a cushion  so i gave in  and went back to work  i figured  i   ve been living on almost nothing  and he   s talking about six figures  i should have no trouble banking cash  i   ll just sink everything i can into savings  and in a couple years i   ll have a whole bunch of money  and i   ll go to nursing school that was       what    what year is this and here we are  i never went to nursing school   chuckles  but i have had a lot of fun in the interim  so that   s from the beginning         that   s to now once you committed to a life of tech  what have been the highlights and the things that have been the most exciting to you  what are the things that make you so pumped about your work having somebody move me across the country was really fucking pumping   chuckles  that kind of stuff has been exciting  i got to move out to vegas and manage a data center installation there  that was really wonderful for me because it was a lot of things that i loved  i got to work from home  i got to live in the desert  and i got to manage this data center installation  i really love the anal retentiveness of managing a data center  and just keeping it really immaculate  that was a lot of fun for me in the last couple of years  tho  i   ve got to admit  i   ve really lost my excitement on tech  i   ve kind of been getting to the point of         this is    years in  now         i   m starting to go what the fuck do i do next  like  i have no other marketable skills  what do i do and it   s also getting a lot harder  in       when i first started really learning linux  it felt entirely within reason to think that i would get to a point where i understood it all  and that it would be good  i still feel like  back then  that was possible  and i know i   m not alone on that  because i   ve had this conversation with one of my current coworkers  but there   s just been so much advancement in the last fifteen years  the last ten years  the last five years  the last two years  that there   s just too much so keep up with  and i don   t know how to do it anymore  i read a blog post this week about how they   re changing something about the way that you define functions in python  and my immediate response was aggravation  one more fucking thing that i need to remember  god damnit i mean  honestly  it wasn   t exactly passion that brought me here in the first place  it was that this landed in my lap  and it   s a fucking great salary for somebody with only a high school degree  i mean  that   s why i   m doing it  i don   t know if that   s the answer that you   re looking for   laughter  i think about this sometimes  the only other skill that i know that i have is cooking and baking  food  well  that or drugs  but really only one of those is sustainable   laughter  and food is really hard to succeed in  so i really don   t know what i would be doing if i didn   t have tech  i don   t know what i   d be doing with myself honestly  this might sound weird to you  but it sounds a little bit different and refreshing to me  to finally meet someone willing to admit that it is work to them  it is a job  because we live in a place where everybody puts on a face of     i   m doing what i love  and i   m so lucky to like work on my ultimate passion     and it   s not      true for everyone  it is work  and i think it makes people who don   t totally know what their passions are  or they don   t totally know what the thing they   re destined to do  feel bad about themselves  i think this is a town where people love that myth of     i just had a passion for this  and i   m so lucky to be doing exactly the thing that i   m so passionate about with this app that does this thing     i feel like it   s a bit of a myth  but everybody feels pressured to    to maintain the bullshit  yeah  because  i think  it   s like  if we break that down  then we have to reevaluate everything  then it becomes  how much else are we lying to ourselves about   laughs  ya know  in order to keep doing this  in order to keep spending                every month on just our rent  to keep being away from our families  accepting that we can   t afford to travel or go on the vacations that we want to go on  because we   re spending all of this money just to be here  i get it  i totally understand why people have to maintain the myth that everything   s perfect yeah  it is a thing that you can still do a really good job at  even if it   s not your ultimate passion  you can still be smart and proficient and do good work  even if it   s not your dream product  which i think people also worry about here  they have to be working on the perfect product or the exact company that they   ve always been dreaming of  and anything else is a failure  you know i wonder if that   s kind of a byproduct of what a youthful group it is that   s going into these organizations now  ya know  like i wonder how much of that passion is fueled by youth  take where i am now  this is the first time in my career that i   ve looked around and gone     oh  i   m the old guy in the room     among my immediate group of about     i beat everyone but the director by easily more than a decade  and even the director only has me beat by less than a year  and these guys are passionate about tech  and it   s a little reminiscent of how it used to be when i was younger  i definitely remember being really excited to do the work  it definitely was fun for me  i think because it was easy  and i think because i knew it so well  it was just like     okay  yeah  we can do that  here you go     it was easy  it feels like it has that same level of ease for these younger kids  and now it   s kind of hard  and so it   s lost a lot of the fun  for me  now it really is a means to an end  that   s over the last couple of year that   s happened what else have been struggles for you feeling like the only queer in the organization has definitely been hard  it wasn   t until      that i was on a team with somebody else who was queer  that was like    years into my career  there had been other queers in the companies         in sales  in creative  etc         but none in tech  and  i wasn   t working nowhere         this was new york city and san francisco at one point  i actually ended up         how should i say this         separating from an employer after completely losing my mind about their insensitive treatment of queer issues  they had run a red cross blood drive  and it wasn   t getting much attention  so the director of hr came around and tried to drum up participation  when she asked me  i was like     i guess i   ll do it  whatever     i had been smoking a lot of weed at that point  so i messaged to a friend i was like     ha ha ha  somebody   s going to get my weed laced blood  lucky them   ha ha     and he   s just like     dude  you can   t donate blood  what are you talking about     i   m like     what am i talking about  what are you talking about i can   t donate blood  of course i can donate blood     they   re like     no  you   re gay     and so i   m all     wait  that shit   s still real  what fucking year is this     so  i went and researched  and  yea  okay it is still real  apparently it   s still       so  i went back to the director of hr  and said         seriously  just like this  because i thought it was fucking hilarious            hey  listen  it turns out  because i am a man who has had sex with a man at least once since       they will politely accept my blood donation and then throw it in the trash  i think that   s wasteful  and so i   m not going to do it     she goes     okay     and crosses my name off the list so  they do the event  i was away the day that they did it  but they sent out an e mail afterwards  and the email was the first thing that i saw when i opened my laptop on my first day back after a really intense  very emotional weekend  i   m not making excuses  just trying to set the scene a little bit maybe  anyway  here   s this e mail  and it   s describing the very successful blood drive  and how they got this many units of blood and other than one person who had to be excluded due to recent travel restrictions  it was a resoundingly successful event i went non fucking linear i typed up this huge email  breaking down bit by bit why it was nonsense that gay men would be excluded from donating  that this is in violation of our company values which state that all employees must be included in all things i then went on to be very  very  very colorful in the illustration of how that made me feel  it was the excessively colorful last paragraph that pushed me over the edge  but i think it came out of a lot of feeling completely fucking alone in this company  because i evidently needed to be completely galled  the hr person  on my way out  had the audacity to give me     c   mon  rob  he coo is gay     well you know what  where the fuck was that information when i asked for it   when i asked my manager  and his manager  and his manager  where are the other queers in this company  so that i don   t feel so fucking alone  why did nobody have anything to say so  that   s probably been the hardest thing about the work i had moved away from home when i was     so i wasn   t living at home before i moved to san francisco anyway  so that wasn   t specifically hard for me  i have a brother who was just under a year old when i moved away  and having limited time to spend with him kinda sucked  but our relationship was pretty strong anyway the being alone part was hard  but that had nothing to do with tech  that was just me  the     i   ve moved all the way across the country to this place that   s supposed to be mecca for me  both in ways of queer and in ways of tech      part   that was rough  since i discovered pretty quickly within those first two years that it was neither   laughter  i was able to be laid off and not find more work  and it was no more gay from my understanding than new york city was  i guess that   s probably been the hardest  but  again  not specifically related to tech yeah  it seems like it   s kind of an extreme version of just not knowing anyone like you and how isolating that must be  and how that must affect your morale over time  were you able to find support networks anywhere during that time yeah  in the early     s  there was still a lot of really good underground y online stuff  like the online chat stuff  that was somehow more nurturing  or more of a bonded experience  than chat is today  it   s so disposable today  there were definitely groups that i got to be a part of that i hold on to some legacy from that  most of my current friends descend directly  in one way or another  from those early chat experiences how how do you feel about the current state of tech bubble or boom or however you want to look at it versus the last one i have been growing increasingly concerned  it definitely does seem like we   re at a point of being back to crazy times  like  how can these organizations be worth billions with a b  no  i don   t buy it  even if what you   re buying is the talent in the company that built the product to add it to your portfolio  i don   t buy that it   s a billion dollars  plus people quit  i just don   t get it i don   t think about it too consciously  but probably unconsciously  it   s probably fueling a lot of my discomfort about the state of things for myself  i have been in the position before where i   ve had to compete with people i know were a lot smarter than me for work  and now i   d be competing in a much different way  because i am even less attractive now that i   m    years old  right  now i   m not this young kid that you can abuse and make do whatever the fuck you want to so i am a little bit concerned  i didn   t know to plan for it back then  but i   m working on it for this time  but  in any case  i think  just like back then  i   m just going to keep riding it until i can   t anymore  hopefully  i   ll figure out a good plan b before then what would ideally you like to see change in tech  culturally or technologically or economically or whatever i would like to see it spread  i would like to see this type of an environment exist in places that are not just san francisco  and i don   t quite get why that hasn   t migrated yet where do you see yourself five or ten years from now such an interesting question  in the past  the answer to that question has always been     exactly where i am now  just making more money     answered just like that  as a question   laughter  let   s see  ten years from now  i   m going to be     i really don   t know that i have the capacity for any more advancement within tech  i don   t know that i want to go the route of architect  and i   m pretty confident i don   t want to go manager  i think it should be evident  from your interactions with me  that that would be a terrible terrible idea   chuckles but  i don   t know  i see a couple possibilities in one scenario  i   m still working in tech  either for my current employer or another  but i   m living somewhere in utc       so somewhere between new zealand and burma  and working      remotely in another scenario  i   m living in utc       but giving scuba diving lessons to western tourists and in still a third  and i think more realistic  scenario  i   m still in california  working in the medical cannabis industry in some capacity  i   ve been fighting this impulse for the last several years  but every single time i really try to come up with something that i can actually feel passionate about  this is all i come back to  my current partner surprised me recently by proposing the idea     what if we opened a dispensary together     so we   ve started exploring that possibility so i don   t know how are you supposed to know i wish i knew  i   ve never known  i   ve always just kind of been doing it  i don   t know  i   ll take it as it comes  in a perfect world  if i could actually script it  i   d be doing some sort of queer rights activism  my current partner         he   s actually a student at city college right now         came home one day  and he goes     hey  what would you think     he   s ethnically cambodian     if i wanted to move to cambodia and do queer rights activism there     it   s a country that   s kinda ripe for it  i thought     that would be fucking amazing  it would be incredible to be part of that movement  oh my god     so  who knows  maybe i   ll be doing that  if i could do that and fund it with         like i said         a job that i   m still getting san francisco money from         and just not losing all of it         yanno  that would be fantastic yeah  laughter  i don   t know  i don   t know my last question for you is what advice would you have for someone just getting started out in tech and perhaps feeling isolated that   s a hard question  because i still don   t know  i mean  if i didn   t have the employee resource group where i am  i would again be in a place where most everyone immediately around me is very straight  one of our dbas  she   s not specifically a lesbian  because she   s married  but she was right on top of me  so i would   ve had that  but i don   t know if i didn   t have her or the employee group  i wish i knew  laughs   i guess it would just be keep waiting and eventually it happens  there   s groups  there   s these meet ups  but they   ve never felt right to me  even our employee group has done one or two  like  social mixers with the queer groups from some other local tech companies  and i   ve gone to them  but it   s just like a bar  so  i guess  in a way  i still feel alone  i   m working with more queers  but i still feel alone  i   m not working with queer engineers  so i still struggle with trying to answer that question  i guess words from a techie turned freelance photographer  http   helenaprice coman ongoing series documenting the stories of underrepresented people in tech
