you could make something right now  if you wanted to stop reading  grab a sheet of butcher   s paper and brainstorm ideas  you could probably come up with half a dozen ideas for apps  books or products  ideas aren   t the hard part  after all         just ask tom haverford you could build a wordpress site and start harassing your friends to test the concept  you could start writing op ed pieces on medium and put    founder    or    author    in your twitter bio within    hours  you could throw up a landing page  post the first chapter of a book and start pushing it on product hunt where things get tough is when you   re trying to make something that people genuinely give a shit about  you don   t want your dream to die in thechamber  because nobody read it  watched it  used it or listened to it  thedeafening silence surrounding your work can crush your soul if you want to make something that people really care about  that they actually give a hot shit about  you have to care about it yourself  because if you don   t  then try as you might  it   ll come out in the final product the reason for this the only way you   ll be able to consistently work  when you don   t want to work  consistently try when you don   t want to try  is by deeply and honestly caring about your work the best writing advice i have ever heard was to write specifically for someone i know  it   s a genius idea  every time i go to create something  or build something i think about who i know that would benefit from what i   m doing if you have something that you care enough about to make  you have to askthe next question         who are you making it for  what information do they need  what turn of phrase would stop them in their tracks  what is their single pain point that the product could solve  or their secret story that your novel would be able to touch and cultivate into a real emotional response you need to ask yourself whether you have the courage  the strength  the motivation and the passion to make what you want to make  and i mean really ask yourself  because when you first come up with an idea you can get so caught up in it that you can   t see anything else when that feeling starts to die down  or you get used to it  you can realise that you don   t have the real raw power to be able to finish and follow through  that   s not a bad thing  there is nothing wrong with recognising that a project isn   t right for you  maybe there   s another project that is it   s not enough just to care about what you   re making         it has to feel right have you ever watched one of those reality tv singing competitions  you   ve probably seen a hundred young people  eyes shining  clutching microphones and talking about their dreams  they   ll explain that ever since they were kids  they wanted to be singers they hardly ever say they wanted to sing  when it comes down to it  half the time it   s because actually singing isn   t the end goal  they want the trappings and lifestyle and the breaks of being a singer the same is true for anything you could make  do you want to make x  or do you want to be the person who made x  because if you don   t care about the act of making something  and if you don   t want to get out there every day and try to make something  you might as well quit if you want to write a book that can break someone   s heart         work hard if you want to start a business that changes the world         work hard if you want to draw a comic book that expresses everything you are  and dream about         work hard this post originally appeared in the mission jon is the founder of creatomic jon works with creative people to help them do the work they love and become focused  jon is incredibly excited about changing lives  you can reach out for a free coaching session by emailing  email  protected       cdata     function t e r n c a p  try t document currentscript  function   for t document getelementsbytagname  script   e t length e    if t e  getattribute  data cfhash   return t e     if t   c t previoussibling   p t parentnode if a c getattribute  data cfemail    for e    r   x  a substr        n   a length n n    e              x  a substr n    r  tostring      slice     p replacechild document createtextnode decodeuricomponent e   c  p removechild t   catch u               i   m jon westenberg  i   m an entrepreneur  a law school drop out  and a passionate creative  life is about getting up when you fall down  www jonwestenberg composts on how to build things you love  embrace creativity and make cool shit  www creatomic co
