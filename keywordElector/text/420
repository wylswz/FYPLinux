articles women of abstract expressionism review blowing up the boys club            denver the denver art museum   s    women of abstract expressionism     the first show to focus on the topic  was probably inevitable  given today   s hypersensitivity to matters of gender  but given the not unfounded perception that the new york art world of the     s was dominated by hard drinking  chest beating males  who overshadowed and condescended to their female colleagues  it   s important to be reminded that women played a role in the era   s radical rethinking of aesthetic possibilities  so why did i emerge from a leisurely visit to the show with its passionately enthusiastic instigator  gwen f  chanzit  curator of modern art at dam and director of museum studies in art history at the university of denver  feeling not exhilarated and excited  as i   d hoped to be  but mildly disappointed   women of abstract expressionism    denver art museum   through sept      my expectations had been raised by the exhibition   s ambitious catalog  which includes essays by ms  chanzit and the art historians  robert hobbs  ellen g  landau  susan landauer and  joan marter  editor of the woman   s art journal   plus an interview with the distinguished critic  irving sandler  a friend to and welcome studio visitor for many of the exhibited artists  there   s a good chronology  informative documentary photographs  illustrations of most exhibited works  and brief biographies of    female painters   many obscure  most from the east coast  some from the west  only one   alma thomas  african american   each with one work reproduced  the criterion appears to have been that at some point in the     s  each of them made paintings that responded to abstract expressionist ideas  that several of them are known for quite other kinds of work does not seem to have been an issue  not everything is particularly noteworthy  or particularly original   but it   s difficult to fault the desire to enrich the history of recent american art as written to date the exhibition is necessarily far more modest  concentrating on groups of work by    painters    mary abbott  jay defeo  elaine de kooning  perle fine  helen frankenthaler  sonia gechtoff  judith godwin  grace hartigan  lee krasner  joan mitchell  deborah remington and  ethel schwabacher  the daniel libeskind designed wing of dam  with its perverse slanted walls  has been improved by vertical insertions  but the resulting spaces are still cranky and somewhat incoherent  on the plus side  we get informative views of other artists    work from each individual section  also on the plus side     women of abstract expressionism    includes some first rate paintings     abstraction     a small  tough      de kooning  all vigorous strokes and high contrast  frankenthaler   s radiant    jacob   s ladder            with its delicious greens and rusty pinks  krasner   s bold    stretched yellow            an homage to  matisse  striking for clear color and emphatic collaged on floating  dark shapes  hartigan   s robust  deep red  economically constructed interior     the creeks            the selection of mitchells is exemplary  emphasizing the not always apparent variety with which she could compose her webs of paint these painters all shared their male colleagues    convictions that the source of art was the unconscious and that the artist   s role was to reveal the unseen  not to depict the known  but were they abstract expressionists or even  in some instances  abstract painters  frankenthaler rejected ab ex   s contingent  wet into wet gestures   which just about everyone else in    women of abstract expressionism    embraced   inventing  instead  an influential method of staining with floods of thin  luminous color  de kooning and hartigan both worked largely with figurative imagery  albeit freely   that frankenthaler would have shunned any show that labeled her a    woman    anything is another matter  like many others in the exhibition  she always insisted that she was a painter  without qualifiers  surprises  for the most part  the selections remind us why the best known of the included artists are the best known  the less familiar gechtoff   s murky  energetically scrawled canvases  done before she left san francisco for new york  are unexpected  but those done afterward are fairly generic  fine   s scribbled black and white canvases are extremely accomplished and clearly impassioned  but there   s a flavor of  philip guston   s drawings  it   s remarkable that defeo   s enormous  encrusted slab of matte gray oil paint  punctuated by dangling strings  is in the show   it resembles a rock face and probably is as easy to transport   but it posits ideas about materiality and physicality very different from those associated with ab ex the show raises provocative questions  such as    does women   s abstraction of the     s differ from men   s     the curators suggest that women were more willing to allow references to specific experience into their work and cite titles as evidence  even though they were usually attached after the fact  maybe  frankenthaler   s    jacob   s ladder    was a response to the structure of the completed picture  an accompanying film  with clips of all    artists  provides interesting observations  contradictions and other ideas  the big question  of course  is why the    women included in the show were chosen  rather than any of the others in the catalog  we all have alternative lists  mine is headed by alma thomas  not strictly an abstract expressionist  perhaps  but a hell of an abstract painter   ms  wilkin is an independent curator and critic
