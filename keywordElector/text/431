this transcript has been automatically generated and may not be      accurate in an increasingly data driven world stand even drones will have data plans as for rice and continues to reach for the sky is     literally     are coming up this     three     the wall street journal     welcome to seize the law street journal s tech news briefing on tanya the stairs in the work     so still and     verizon will offer data plans for rounds     this is a big step that would allow pilots to connect their devices to difference in network     and then they d be able to strain and transmit other data to a computer or smartphone on the crowd as it stands today turned to me we utilize public airwaves via a standard remote control which authentic you work by a wide year or via bluetooth to a device     that connects to the internet     little more complicated this aims to simplify and takes an important steps into future crony of regulation considerations     let s break it all down right now with the right commutes in you broke the story for the journal in joins us right now i run     the israeli and of course so i have to say upon     seeing this story my first initial gut reaction is that these dispute the less than my data plan i was looking at my phone bill and tears so how will these pence compared to what s out there     when boudreaux plans aren t sort of roughly speaking in line     with the prices of you that consumers pay for david s found twenty five dollars for when you divide and eighty dollars for ten     gigabytes of course the cost of the drone imagine is probably a lot more than the cost of a camera phone     um     that doesn t include you smartphones have visitors to these things to go along with it the generally speaking it s kind of roughly the same amount of data     this is all really sort of experimental present wants to open the door to see what companies want to do with the woman try and how the business of balls in the hope of that ll help inform the discussion about     country regulate these things in which of the business models being it s all very early days for drones such an important step so let s talk about the capability as soon as it destroys had these data plans what will allow them to do essentially     what is two things that verizon and the rest of the broader industry is interested in     the first is sort of the more practical of the scene for verizon think the connection put a cell and ten in the belly of the drone and flatter and uses a flying celts are making news that during emergencies if there s     some salt sites down after hurricane or cynic that you can     quickly five it s and that s all     still in the very early stages but it s     the technology works did did did a demonstration of its history in new jersey     aam with the data plans     the other application of it is     connecting the drone to the internet so this piece of the drones flying around     generally there s that there s a link between the drone of iowa     but this will allow that drone also to transmit data over the cellular network to the broader internet so and analysts that sitting hundreds of miles away in a computer terminal will also be a will to plug into the drone and see what it s the mersey today it s getting so     the thinking is that this to be really useful for drones that are expecting     oil pipelines     better unify haunting pictures back     or or or wildfires that s a year     or anything that might require a new kind of remote     aam and the sensory analysis or anything like that says that the companies that would best you know what with that kind of resin is targeting the said its internet of things enterprise companies to big businesses that want to     attached to bits     you know but in what is the business model it involves this will require some regulatory changes but if the if     the business model involves unit could be the main consumers     can the present wicked today on this in the future is well for     the onion on notice that they re a no call law to turning around and in no way come the kinds of things     to my deals come up with a thick and a connector drones to dinner spots talk about what it means for dollars in revenue this is promising in that area as well it could be a diffley could be in the wireless companies are facing a lot of slowing growth in wireless     the wireless units inside these old phone companies use to be the hot growing staying in now either but is that a smartphone and there s more price competition between the four national carriers and so     they re all looking for what is the next thing we can attach the network that will drive revenue     the internet of things is the thing that they re a lot of them are talking about we can we can connect all these devices everywhere     but that sort of a difficult business model because a lot of things you connect them into a corner protective refrigerator like one second in the     u s vector for good cheer why fi     the drone is a mobile fame that     the cell network can     you know will be the best thing for it rather than why fi which really wouldn t be the case and also the the     the rates that they re charging     look like it could be a potential revenue stream the question is how many drugs with a b if ups and fedex and amazon all these companies have     tens of thousands of deliveries joins the connection potentially be     a pretty significant revenue source right now     revenue from just connected devices in the internet of things     is pretty small it s almost microscopic for the carriers     in terms of the fact that they re hundred and thirty plus billion dollar your companies but     it is growing at a pretty rapid clip     so there is some promise there     that this could be real revenue source for carriers going forward     right so this is an important first step to come in on this podcast is recently in and there s talk of to live returns autonomous deliveries     yes you know you mentioned how it s a stepping stone and how to     iron out these regulations to produce and if it s     that whole brown as well yes that is the probably the most promising the most interesting thing about connecting france and it s great now     federally tuition surprise that the     pilot of the drone the inside of the drone the drums justify above four hundred feet unless there s a special permit     but in the future there s a lot of hope and expectation that drones can become     fully autonomous or least remotely piloted you know from farther away     then be used in delivery window system so a truck made drive down the street in the drones are out flying off the drone picking it flying off the truck     picking up packages and dropping them and corsets     that would require those drones to have connectivity so that they know where they are or know where this post ago they can communicate with a centralized location     in the sky require wireless connection and the existing cellular network is the most logical thing for the drones to connect to     so present stepping in here and and actually saying they were going in life     get this business off the ground let people start doing this for     the upcoming this functionality of it is still     i m not allowed for a good record of you but the sort of     early steps will inform how about a work because don t get some practice so the the we ll see how these things connect what kinds of     technological change the minute to make before they can get the foyer at times thing when the regulations open up     the beach to see how to smile plan out     of dry kitson thank you as always featuring things have me on     the can check
