 owned messaging service  surprisingly without typos     send     to jarrard for my half of lunch     sends money via venmo or square cash  depending on which one you   ve set up many of my most used apps  however  aren t siri controllable yet   and may not be because of apple   s restrictions  music services  to do lists and other email apps aren t supported by the developer tools apple provides  apple says this is just the beginning of how it envisions siri being used across ios  amazon   s alexa not only lets you use all sorts of third party apps  it allows you to set them as your defaults  most of siri   s third party integration has been so reliable and accurate that it   s spurred me to start talking to it more and more  in some cases  i   ve been impressed with how much siri has learned about how we speak  she understands and responds to casual phrases like     shoot an email to geoff    or    what   s up with the weather today    sometimes  though  i have to carefully phrase the question     when   s the next train coming     pulls up the definition of    train    on wikipedia     show me transit directions     however  shows me the latest train schedule  and when it comes to general knowledge  siri comes in third place behind google   s and amazon   s assistants in a round of what we like to call ai jeopardy  i asked     when is the first      presidential debate     google knew the answer  monday  sept     at   p m  et  alexa got the date right   but the time wrong siri   s response     here   s what i found on the web for    when is the first      presidential debate         apple says siri is updated every other week with new information on the mac  siri doesn   t replace the mouse or trackpad  but it complements them in a big way  in fact  siri is a multitasking dream on the bigger screen   once you get the hang of delegating tasks to it asking siri to set reminders or create calendar appointments takes half the time of opening the apps and manually typing in the information  unfortunately  you   ll have to use apple   s own apps  other than facebook and  twitter

 there   s no third party app control on the mac yet another useful trick  asking siri to launch an app while you   re working in another  you can also have it take care of system related tasks  like adjusting the volume or locating files  i have a very messy desktop  so    show me the images on my desktop    is a lifesaver siri   s biggest shortcoming on the mac is how you get its attention  you can   t simply say    hey siri     instead  you press and hold command and space bar  or click on the siri icon in the dock  one of the best aspects of amazon   s echo and   microsoft

   s cortana on windows pcs      albeit one that stokes a lot of privacy fears   has been that they listen for you  even if you   re on the other side of the room  even if your newer iphone responds to    hey siri     alexa consistently answers faster  after you   ve used apple   s airpods  you really wish for more reasons to chat up siri   whether you   re at home  at work or even in a car  double tap on one of the white pods and you hear a chime to let you know that siri   s all ears  the mics are extremely impressive  siri had no problem skipping a song while i was on the subway platform or giving me a weather report while i washed dishes   you could achieve this with wired earphones  it   s just not as cool   it feels like the wireless future we   ve been waiting for  artificial intelligence that   s always there to lend a hand we aren   t living in the future  however  airpods are a great prop for my sci fi script  but that   s all they are right now  when i try to keep up a conversation with siri   or any other virtual assistant   things fall apart within seconds  when i asked siri to schedule a meeting with  tim cook and then find out more information about    him     the assistant had no idea what    him    i was referring to     i   m afraid i can   t answer that  joanna    the way google   s assistant does context requires collecting and storing a lot of information about you   something apple has vowed not to do  apple   s made baby steps forward in predictive intelligence  but it   s still hard to see how it can compete when people willingly give their data to its rivals    the hard part of the technology is not taking it word by word and turning it into text     says  norman winarsky  past president of sri ventures and a co creator of siri  which sri sold to apple  the hard part is recognizing    the intent and context of the conversation    that said  winarsky predicts in    years      of the things we do will be ai assisted     ten percent of the things you do really needs joanna the person  joanna can delegate the other     to a siri like ai     he explained to me this new siri may pave the way for that  but it   s going to need to figure out    who is running for president     first  write to joanna stern at joanna stern wsj com or on twitter  joannastern
