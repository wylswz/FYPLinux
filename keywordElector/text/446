articles breaking the waves turandot and macbeth reviews adultery in the name of love            philadelphia missy mazzoli   s    breaking the waves     which had its world premiere at opera philadelphia on thursday  is savage  heartbreaking and thoroughly original  the       lars von trier film on which it is based has a disturbing undercurrent of violent misogyny  but the operatic bess mcneill  for all her frailties  is no victim  classic tragic opera heroines may weep and die  but bess  as conceived by ms  mazzoli and librettist  royce vavrek  and sung by the extraordinary  kiera duffy  is an evolving  unforgettable character   breaking the waves    opera philadelphia   through oct        turandot    through oct     the story takes place in the     s on the bleak  windswept scottish isle of skye  where the deeply religious bess  who belongs to a repressive calvinist church  marries jan  a scandinavian worker from an offshore oil rig  and an outsider to the community  when jan is left paralyzed and near death by an accident on the rig  bess is convinced that if she has sex with other men  she can keep him alive and ultimately trade her own life for his mr  vavrek   s spare  eloquent libretto leaves ample space for ms  mazzoli   s music to create a complex portrait of bess and her stark environment  the opera starts with a huge chord that sounds like a wave crashing on a cliff  and then goes right to bess   s first aria     his name is jan     with its slender  rising line  which declares bess a force to be reckoned with  three well shaped  smartly paced acts clearly delineate bess   s sexual awakening  her doubts  and her growing sense of her own convictions  even as others  including people who love her  call her feeble  stupid or mad  she becomes  remarkably  a vividly modern  christ like figure ms  mazzoli   s score deftly balances trenchant arias with a kaleidoscopic orchestration whose layers and colors suggest messiaen  britten and jan    ek but is finally all her own  the brittle  glassy high strings  the accordion like sound of a melodica  the crashes of percussion  even an electric guitar  are elements in an unsettled harmonic tapestry that evokes bess   s turbulent inner world as well as the violent landscape around her  every bit has meaning  for example  the drone in the orchestra when bess   s mother reproves her for her hysteria about jan   s departure for the rig  and tells her that women must    endure     one stunning effect is the central role of the male chorus  which portrays not only the severe  hymn singing elders of the church  who cast bess out  but also the voice of god  which only she hears  the abrupt disappearance of that voice  when bess has sunk deeply into her sexual crusade and is rejected by everyone around her  is like her calvary  its return sends her off  joyously  on her final  suicidal mission ms  duffy embodied bess in a fearless vocal and physical performance  her gleaming soprano finding all the colors of poignant innocence  baritone john moore went from hearty sexiness to drug induced delirium as jan  who  in his beautifully realized final aria  at last seems worthy of bess   david portillo   s pure tenor conveyed the sympathetic rationalism of dr  richardson  who treats jan and tries to help bess   eve gigliotti was grounded as her kindly sister in  law  dodo   patricia schuman  severe as her disapproving mother  and  marcus deloach was cold and weighty as the minister   steven osgood was the excellent conductor of the    member orchestra the production  directed by  james darrah and designed by  adam rigg  was overly dark and abstract  the opera is so surreal and psychological that without any sense of place  you can lose connection with the humanity of the characters  the costumes by chrisi karvonides did supply local scottish flavor  and mr  darrah ably set up the fraught relationship of bess and the community  he pulled no punches with the sexually explicit scenes  but some of the nudity was gratuitous  co commissioned by beth morrison projects     breaking the waves    is slated next for the prototype festival in new york in january       it deserves a vigorous life beyond that opera philadelphia is changing its format to incorporate an opening festival  this season   s three opera program was a trial run for a bigger version next fall  puccini   s    turandot    played at the academy of music in a new co production with five other u s  companies  directed by  renaud doucet and designed by andr   barbe  it has a traditional concept with lots of red  some elaborate costumes  and an unusually diverting portrayal of ping  pang and pong as sardonic chinese clowns  the main draw was  christine goerke   s ferocious turandot   joyce el khoury was a sweet li    and  marco berti a strenuous calaf   corrado rovaris was the ebullient conductor more interesting was an imported show at the prince theater  co presented with fringearts  the south african troupe third world bunfight in an adaptation of verdi   s    macbeth     directed by  brett bailey  trimmed  rearranged  and adeptly re scored by  fabrizio cassol for a    member orchestra  three principals and a chorus of seven  the opera was set by mr  bailey in the brutal  civil war torn eastern congo of the present  with warlord costumes  slides of documentary photographs  some loose supertitle translations  a hint of african drumming and an all black cast  it made perfect  horrible sense  opera companies often have difficulty casting the two leads  they should consider the powerful baritone  owen metsileng and especially soprano nobulumko mngxekeza  a searing  steely voiced lady macbeth   premil petrovic conducted  ms  waleson writes about opera for the journal
