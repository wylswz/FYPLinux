articles the glimmerglass festival review blameless witches and a wicked barber            cooperstown  n y  the glimmerglass festival scored high marks with two rare operas this season   robert ward   s taut  dramatic    the crucible           heightens the theatricality of its source material   arthur miller   s      play about the salem witch trials  an allegory for mccarthy   s anti communist witch hunts  ward   s melodic  vocally fluent music sets  bernard stambler   s libretto clearly  the piece is intensely operatic  with torrid solo moments and intimate scenes that build steadily into big  confrontational ensembles    the glimmerglass festival    through aug      ward   s portrait of how a perceived threat splits a community  setting off an orgy of opportunism and score settling  is built on incisive musical character development  glimmerglass fielded a superb cast  two powerhouse singers   brian mulligan and  jamie barton  anchored the piece as the beleaguered john and  elizabeth proctor   david pittsinger brought the measured voice of authority to the witch hunter reverend hale  who sees too late what he has unleashed  while  jay hunter morris was appropriately harsh voiced as the power mad judge danforth  a splendid group of singers from the festival   s young artists program filled the other roles  most notably the vivid soprano  ariana wehr as the spiteful  hysterical abigail  and  helena brown as the motherly rebecca nurse   nicole paiement supplied the full blooded conducting   neil patel   s set   simple wooden buildings invaded by naked forest branches   and  mark mccullough   s eerie lighting suggested the community   s fear of the unknown   jessica jahn supplied the period costumes and director  francesca zambello pointedly balanced the accelerating madness   the climax of the courtroom scene was particularly fierce   with the few moments of repose    peter kazaras   s witty production of  rossini   s    the thieving magpie           was funny without undermining the opera semiseria core of the piece  the stakes are high  accused of stealing silverware  the servant ninetta is condemned to death  she is rescued at the last minute when the real thief   the eponymous magpie   is discovered  mr  kazaras and designer  myung hee cho created a deliciously bird themed show  which lightened that sense of impending doom  the larcenous  non singing magpie  choreographer meg gillentine  with a shock of blue hair and an uncannily birdlike gait  was in evidence throughout  so the audience knew who was responsible  even if the characters didn   t  with her agile coloratura and white dress   rachele gilmore was sweet and dove like as the put upon heroine  the lecherous mayor   musa ngqungwana  a powerful bass baritone   who has designs on ninetta  strutted and loomed like a vulture in a dark red coat  ninetta   s friend pippo  the mellifluous mezzo  allegra de vita  had the yellow plumage of tropical bird  and the magistrate and jury who condemn ninetta resembled a group of owls  shaking their feathers in time to the music  ms  cho   s attractive set used art nouveau style patterns of branches to create a nest  a cage  and a jail  prettily lit by mr  mccullough   joseph colaneri   s fleet conducting kept the numerous ensembles on track  and in the plot light second half of the opera  mr  kazaras cleverly used the secondary characters to poke a little good natured fun at the endless string of farewells before the final rescue  can  stephen sondheim   s     sweeney todd    work outside its original victorian setting  in which the barber sweeney takes revenge on the entire human race  director  christopher alden   s glimmerglass effort did not  his production  which opened in a     s british church basement  apparently a community theater giving a play within a play  was all concept  with the musical shoehorned into it  mr  alden   s familiar tropes   flat  bare walls  characters lined up in chairs against them  giant shadows  deliberately affectless acting   leached all the humanity and comedy out of the show  which made it cold rather than chilling    terese wadden   s costumes were deliberately over the top and tacky   johanna   s baby doll pink dress  the barber pirelli   s elvis inspired sequins   andrew cavanaugh holland   s blank sets and  robert wierzel   s flat lighting made it hard to focus on the action  the singers seemed largely at sea about how to deliver mr  sondheim   s reams of text  both spoken and sung   greer grimsley  sweeney  and  peter volpe  judge turpin  flailed physically and had trouble with score   s syncopations   luretta bybee   s voice didn   t project comfortably in the middle range where most of mrs  lovett   s part lies   after the august    performance that i saw  she withdrew from the role for the remainder of the run   high points were the bright voiced soprano  emily pogorelc as johanna  and  harry greenleaf who sang ardently as anthony   john demain   s deliberate conducting didn   t build tension  and there were a striking number of pit stage coordination problems the festival rounded out its mainstage offerings with a solid    la boh  me     with simple sets by  kevin depinet and belle   poque costumes by  erik teague  it was directed with youthful   lan by  e  loren meeker  cast standouts included  raquel gonz  lez as mimi and  vanessa becerra as musetta  mr  colaneri was the sympathetic conductor  the company has greatly expanded its ancillary offerings  ms  barton   s solo recital was highlighted by a hilarious staged rendition of  lee hoiby   s    bon app  tit     in which she impersonated  julia child and baked a chocolate cake  the company also commissioned a one hour opera  with piano   staged by ms  zambello  that showcased teen aged members of its youth chorus and some young artists     wilde tales     by composer  laura karpman and librettist  kelley rourke  a charming mashup of oscar wilde   s stories    the happy prince    and    the remarkable rocket     was sophisticated yet tailored to the talents of its performers  especially delightful were the chorus of birds  a trio of singing sparklers  and high school senior  richard pittsinger as the egomaniacal rocket   ms  waleson writes about opera for the journal
