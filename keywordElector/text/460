the time pass to more     than a century     your ego apple said it is time to look and feel of the i phone or degree temp     and     bought estimates there they re entitled to     eto o the profit it and then made selling selling palm that basically cuppa tea i told     them to counter argument that left home     i have lots of different kinds of features and functions and all sorts of     i attached to the component embedded within them and the idea that they should have to fork over everything they made on the phone just     because they entrenched and i had it apparent that there
