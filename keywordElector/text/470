articles sb                                         in  the wolf of wall street   leonardo dicaprio plays jordan belfort  the celebrated crook of the     s who prided himself on his ability to sell anything and did in fact swindle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars  martin scorsese s epic scale comedy of criminality  adapted by terence winter from mr  belfort s book of the same name  is selling three hours of incessant shouting and sensationally bad behavior   mud wrestling without the mud that includes drugs  booze  debauchery  degeneracy and dwarf throwing  it s meant to be an entertaining  even meaningful representation of the penny stock maestro s life and times  but i couldn t buy it  and couldn t wait for the hollow spectacle to end that s no knock on mr  dicaprio  who throws himself  heart and soul  into a character with deep deficits in both departments  let s stipulate that his extravagant embodiment of excess is extremely skillful and very funny  and put other stipulations on record as well  jonah hill  equipped with phosphorescent teeth and a manic affect  is often hilarious as jordan s partner in the sleazy firm of stratton oakmont  so is matthew mcconaughey in a madcap soliloquy on masturbation and the need to stay relaxed  the film does full justice to its denizens  devotion to cocaine  quaaludes and heroin  and to morphine  which jordan takes  because it s awesome   the scorsese touch is everywhere in evidence  swirling set pieces  stratton oakmont s boiler room  full of rabid brokers  as a roman bacchanal   spectacular camera moves  rodrigo prieto was the cinematographer   and all of it heightened and sharpened by thelma schoonmaker s editing  some of the settings are enjoyable  up to a point  for their tacky sumptuousness  i liked the trashing of a lamborghini countach  and sharp witted scenes do play out from time to time on a human scale  in one of them  a couple of fbi agents engage the wily jordan in a game of cat and rat eventually  though  the pandemonium wears you down  in my case  eventually meant the end of the first hour  with two more hours to go   stratton oakmont is america   insists jordan  ever the overreacher  in the course of his self serving valedictory  maybe so  but any meaningful perspective on the greedfest of the period is obscured by the gleefulness of the depiction  the film may well prove profitable  lurid outlaws are always appealing  and there s pleasure to be had in the downfall of slimeballs  but  the wolf of wall street  demands a huge investment of time for a paltry return  sometimes you see failed films and think  well  they tried for this or that but couldn t pull it off  after seeing ben stiller s version of the venerable james thurber story  i don t know what the film was trying for  it s a cipher in every realm but the visual   stuart dryburgh did the stylish cinematography  mr  stiller isn t the first one  of course  to play walter mitty on screen  in       eight years after the thurber story appeared in the new yorker magazine  an elaborate mgm production starred danny kaye as the wistful daydreamer who imagines himself in heroic situations  the movie was overblown  with a succession of preposterous adventures that grew tedious  its durable reputation is due to its star  a great comic actor who did memorably well with walter s mood swings between mousy and manic  mr  stiller s version  written by steve conrad  wisely moderates the derring do  but unwisely sends its hero on a quest that swings tentatively between the spiritual and the absurd even the starting point feels tentative  the time is the present  but walter works in the photo department of life magazine  which closed down as a standalone publication more than a decade ago   he goes forth in search of a missing negative shot by a legendary photographer   walter does have outlandish adventures in the himalayas  greenland and iceland  but the lines between his fantasies and reality keep getting blurred  you don t know  for instance if he s imagining himself jumping from a chopper into arctic waters  or really making the jump  whether the blurring is intentional or accidental  it vitiates a film that already feels dissociated  as if the basic narrative structure hadn t been thought through impressive landscapes  plus kristen wiig s appealing cheryl  the fellow worker who inflames walter s passion  make the movie enjoyable enough  yet its style is a constant bafflement  and nowhere more so than in a key scene on a himalayan mountaintop   an encounter between walter and a character played by sean penn  one could imagine the scene being played relatively straight  as a moment of fleeting profundity in a comedy  or as the culmination of a shaggy dog story  what s so baffling is the way it has been played   drained of energy  tone or discernible attitude  like so much of this journey by a shy guy from life magazine  walter s peak experience is weirdly lifeless family dysfunction has seldom been as flamboyant   or notable for its performances and flow of language   as it is in this screen version of the tracy letts play  directed by john wells from a screenplay by the playwright  the cast alone is worth the price of admission  meryl streep as the cancer riddled  drug addled matriarch  violet weston  sam shepard as her alcoholic husband  julia roberts  julianne nicholson and juliette lewis as the couple s daughters  and chris cooper  ewan mcgregor  margo martindale  benedict cumberbatch and abigail breslin as members of their extended family  the language  rich in invective  flows from kindred spirits who are rich in aggressiveness  both the active and passive flavors  by comparison to this familial grand guignol   who s afraid of virginia woolf   is a crash course in decorousness when i saw the play on broadway some years ago  i had a good seat down front on the left  yet awkward staging prevented me from seeing violet at the family table at the peak of her rage  estelle parsons was formidable in the role  but one of vi s daughters had plunked herself down between her mother and me  the movie provides perfect sight lines  meaning a chance to see ms  streep do all of her stuff at every moment  and she is marvelous   so what else is new about her work   in addition to raging  vi wheedles  needles  seduces and charms  and her mental fogs disperse miraculously whenever she finds a chance to lacerate one of her loved ones with something mean the movie also gives us a chance to see ms  roberts in action  and she s marvelous  too  in an austere style that perfectly complements ms  streep s volcanism  her barbara has the dubious gifts of clarity and self irony  she sees her mother  and her family  for the tortured people they are  but she s still her mother s daughter  in a dark  determinist comedy about the transmission of rage from one generation to the next  this seemingly vital woman is incurably infected ralph fiennes s elegantly crafted  agreeably leisurely period drama does a public service by making the woman of the title visible  born ellen ternan into a family of actors  she was often called nelly and  as an    year old  became the very young and secret lover of charles dickens  who was more than twice her age  the service lies partly in bringing nelly out of obscurity   her story is one of a steep price paid for the passionate attention of a literary giant who may have had no love to give anyone but the characters in his books  it also lies in casting felicity jones  who is as eloquent and beautifully modulated in the role as she is physically beautiful  still  dickens dominates the story  he s a fiery presence as played by mr  fiennes  who directed from abi morgan s adaptation of a book by claire tomalin this immeasurably famous writer and amateur actor doesn t mean to enslave nelly to him  still  he s at the height of his career and engulfed by writing  amateur acting and a gift for giving spellbinding readings  it s tempting to call him a   th century london version of a rock star  but dickens was far more accessible than that  londoners knew him  flocked to him and drew pleasure from his proximity  nelly draws pleasure too  she s inexorably attracted to him  even after she comes to understand that their relationship will remain secret  the film overemphasizes dickens s emotional repression  in fact he was devastated by a terrible accident that  in the film  leaves him relatively cold and mainly concerned about preserving the secrecy of nelly s status  but  the invisible woman  gives us a plausible image of the great man in the fullness of his celebrity  and an affecting portrait of the woman who lived much of her life in his shadow peter berg s screen version of marcus luttrell s book is remarkably good at dramatizing the notorious      navy seal operation that went horrifically bad  the power of this production isn t evident in the preface  a standard brand account of the rigors of seal training  and familiar themes of combat movies make up most of the operation s initial phase   cocky banter  macho preening  talk of wives and girlfriends back home  the first hint of what s to come is someone s casually ominous observation about the complexity of the joint military planning   a lot of moving parts  the parts were set in motion for operation red wings  a covert mission intended to kill or capture a taliban commander in northern afghanistan  a four man team of seals was ambushed by taliban fighters  and the book s author  then the team medic  was the lone survivor of a debacle that also took the lives of    men aboard a rescue helicopter shot down by a rocket propelled grenade  mr  luttrell  now retired  is played by mark wahlberg  the other team members are played by taylor kitsch  emile hirsch and ben foster  all four performances are first rate  and the action is staged with shattering intensity literally and graphically shattering  the film is a celebration of courage  and the brotherhood of warriors facing unfathomable danger in the service of their country  these  too  are familiar themes  but they take on new meaning in  lone survivor   the seals aren t just shot at in a merciless firefight  they are shot  time and again  they are almost aerated by taliban bullets  and they fight on  their training has turned them into fighting machines  and their equipment employs technologies undreamed of in earlier wars  yet their high tech edge is blunted by faulty communications  their support is compromised by limited resources   the film doesn t try to score political points on this score  but questions are implicit in the narrative   and their flesh and blood are anguishingly vulnerable when all the planning comes unraveled  a lot of moving parts in a moving film this is the wellspring of martin scorsese s career  every potent element of his art flowed from it  the violence  the sense of evil  the tribal warfare  the fascination with criminality  and the explosive style  it s a small scale film with enormous impact even now  four decades after it hit the screen  the setting is little italy  where mr  scorsese grew up  and the cast includes the stunningly young robert de niro and harvey keitel  the script was written by mardik martin and the director  who also played a gunman in a car ben stiller was uncompromisingly brilliant  though widely unpopular  in noah baumbach s comedy  which scintillates with intelligence  razor s edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers  mr  stiller is roger greenberg  a middle aging misanthrope whose anger is matched only by his narcissism  greta gerwig gives a performance of heartbreaking delicacy as florence marr  a wistful young woman falling into a love affair with him   i ve gotta stop doing things just because they feel good   florence says  but there s no evidence she feels truly good about anything in choosing one of shakespeare s more opaque plays for his directorial debut  ralph fiennes emulated the character he portrays  a refractory roman general  caius martius coriolanus  for whom compromise equals surrender  but the general comes to a bad end  while mr  fiennes achieved a great beginning as a director  and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity  the cast includes jessica chastain as the hero s ardent wife  virgilia  gerard butler as tullus aufidius  his mortal enemy  and vanessa redgrave as his mother  volumnia  alongside whom today s tiger moms seem toothless
