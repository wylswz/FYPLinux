articles brain exercises dont live up to the hype researchers say           computerized brain training exercises and games  touted for their ability to improve overall cognitive function  may actually only help you get better at the specific game you   re playing that   s the conclusion of a wide ranging review of nearly     studies of brain training published last week in the journal psychological science in the public interest  the review found that none of the studies followed scientific best practices for comparing a group of people practicing an intervention against a control group not getting the intervention     what we found is that there   s really no compelling evidence that these sorts of interventions lead to objectively measured real world improvements     says  daniel simons  a professor of psychology at the university of illinois at urbana champaign and first author of the review brain training exercises generally consist of tasks designed to improve a particular mental ability  such as processing speed or memory  companies including posit science  lumos labs and cogmed market products that make bold claims  including the ability to stave off dementia  consumers spent      million on digital brain health software in       according to market research data cited in the review  lumos labs paid    million earlier this year to settle a deceptive advertising lawsuit brought by the federal trade commission  which charged that the company was making false claims of protecting against age related cognitive decline in its brain training program lumosity  the review  performed by seven psychologists  was challenged by neuroscientists at posit science  whose products are used in many of the studies     this is a disciplinary boundary setting dispute between old school psychologists and neuroscientists     says  henry mahncke  chief executive of the san francisco based company     on the neuroscience side of things  we   ve discovered over the past    years that brain plasticity is a real thing  we can reorganize the structure and the function of the brain    dr  simons  the review   s first author  says some of the studies were too small or had subpar statistical analyses to meet research standards  some used control groups of people that weren   t given a parallel intervention  or that performed tasks that weren   t well matched to the brain training intervention  when studies assessed outcomes in the real world  they were typically based on subjective  self reported results rather than objectively measured performance  he adds  the review looked at studies performed through the end of      the placebo effect also could have influenced the study findings  after practicing brain training for hours  participants    form expectations for what should improve and what shouldn   t improve  and those can affect the outcome     dr  simon says  to demonstrate that a brain training regimen is effective  an intervention study needs a control group that is active and doing something that matches the expectation and motivation of the group receiving the actual intervention  he says dr  simons wouldn   t say there isn   t value in brain training     if you are playing the games solely because you enjoy them  then why not    one of the higher quality studies   the review notes   is a government funded trial known as active  which has been following more than       elderly participants for    years  published studies have reported that participants showed improvements in driving  cognitive function and the ability to perform daily activities  such as preparing a meal  compared with a control group  the study   s researchers recently presented results at the alzheimer   s association international conference showing that a computer speed training exercise   now marketed by posit science   had the potential to cut the risk of developing dementia  dr  simons says the latest results from the active study  short for advanced cognitive training in vital elderly  wasn   t included in the review because it hasn   t been published in a peer reviewed journal  he says the benefits shown in the active trial are fairly small and it has flaws  including relying primarily on self reports to assess improvements in performing daily activities   murali doraiswamy  director of the neurocognitive disorders program at duke university health system  in durham  n c   says the review is fair because the evidence for brain training is mixed     there   s very little evidence to support the transfer of benefits    from the exercises to daily life  he says  the one exception  dr  doraiswamy says  is hand eye coordination  which can be improved through simulation games    we need an independent regulatory agency like the fda to really validate these studies     dr  doraiswamy says     at the present time you don   t have the rigor that you would if a company was developing a medical device    dr  doraiswamy says duke and columbia university are planning a study that will compare brain training with crossword puzzles to evaluate everyday functioning as well as dementia prevention  write to sumathi reddy at sumathi reddy wsj com
