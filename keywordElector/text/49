target look more hidden gun a glock and an assault rifl to be specif thi wa befor orlando and dalla but still wtf and the hide your shotgun from dinner guest tabl is back a well a two other other pin from day i think the algorithm fell asleep on thi one i didn t click on ani suggest in the first home decor email wouldn t it make more sens to tri anoth categori align with my other chosen interest mayb garden or travel sound like i m readi for retir when i say it like that subject new pin for your inspir home board day a m thi is the same bodi templat a the previou email but i love what they ve done with the footer here that simpl graphic is a brilliant way of prod me to get busi fill my first board instead of rehash the same subject line and headlin from day they could have reinforc that prod it would requir anoth layer of dynam content but how about someth like thi board onli ha one lone pin whi not give it some friend one question if pinterest ha billion pin whi are they suggest four of the same one they show me a week ago subject hi bart we found new tini hous storag and tini hous pin and board for you day a m first i ve got to say someth about the time of thi and the three previou messag they all arriv at the same moment in the middl of the night i can understand want a messag to be at top of my inbox in the morn but four befor the coffe kick riski make me think there must have been a glitch in the system especi consid the seven previou day of silenc anyway thi is the pivot i wa expect earlier content curat to one of my other interest lot of interest tini home stuff here speak of small i like how thi email is a microcosm of the site with both pin and board it also show me what the futur of my board could be like thi design convey a lot of option without be crowd or confus essenti it s the bodi templat from befor with a cta follow by a modul for featur board with a second cta i like how the featur board are divid into a main imag and three smaller one remind me of the martha stewart color swatch you can take home from the hardwar store wow home decor realli is my thing pinterest might know me better than i know myself oh and they use my name for the first time in the subject line give me that warm fuzzi feel subject you ve got new pin wait for you day p m well that first imag wa unexpect all the other pin are clearli relat to my indic interest but sinc i haven t click through from ani recent email it s possibl pinterest is just tri to activ me with content their algorithm associ with my segment it would be realli interest to know what other user segment the system ha me in at thi point the focu on new pin in thi email is intrigu as a copywrit i recogn the compel strength of new but a a pinterest user i m more interest in see the most love pin regardless of age also when i click through via the cta it didn t actual take me to these pin and it s not obviou how to find new pin in gener base on the number of like the pin in my feed all appear to be older am i miss some function or is the focu on new just a copywrit tactic to drive engag thi is the last time i ll mention thi that messag seem like anoth good reason to do away with the user gener pin descript subject top trend pin in men s fashion day p m thi email is anoth pivot men s fashion wa probabl trigger by my interest in hairstyl sadli when i tri to grow a thick hipster beard it just look like i have dirt on my face the abil to pivot is a huge strength if they keep rotat through my interest they re bound to reel me in eventu for instanc i had to click on the how to graphic for the triniti neckti knot it look a littl wide and complic for me but i feel way hipper for know about it after receiv those four earlier messag at a m now i ve receiv two at p m were the first four a mistak are they autom p m base on my initi signup and brows time on day i d like to know more about their time tactic after a hand of email i m start to see how thi seri reli on repeat subject line and headlin to set up the regular deliveri of algorithm gener content seem like a smart scalabl copywrit approach and a good way to establish expect howev a a user i skip right over the bodi copi so mani pin so littl time which i ve alreadi seen i d be happi with just the repeat headlin follow by a new set of pin suggest subject thi week s top pin day p m if thi arriv in my actual mailbox i d check the address to see if the mail carrier screw up i have no idea whi they suggest ani of these pin admittedli i ve engag veri littl with the email or the site to thi point so they don t have a lot to work with but rather than a complet random select how about it s possibl too that thi select wa gener from my browser histori or advertis though there would need to be some type of sponsor pin indic for the latter both are possibl accord to the user set twelv email in day that seem like a good place to stop though it s clear a steadi flow of email will continu i had the floodgat open in my account set as a user i would like dial down the frequenc of email over the long term to receiv onli a weekli digest but for peopl who want daili inspir pinterest is prime and readi the autom email aren t perfectli tune from a select design time or copywrit standpoint but the foundat is impress to say the least it s pretti amaz how well they can target and deliv to a new user base on the select of just a few interest and i suspect with more time and interact the system would learn to stop show me firearm and expand on the discoveri of my emerg passion for home decor sustain consult guilti of litter the interweb with email princip new growth commun we re the epicent of the email earthquak but in a good and happi shakey kind of way
