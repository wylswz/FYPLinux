only     have more than one  next  check out the national association of home builders and its    aging in place remodeling checklist     here  you   ll find more than     suggestions  including eight for entryways alone  that can help homeowners age    plus live    safely  independently and comfortably    finally  there   s the    homefit guide    from aarp  the washington based advocacy group  this    page report  filled with diagrams  explains how to create a    lifelong home     one that   s    suitable for anyone  regardless of   age or physical ability     well worth your time  for almost two decades i   ve had my investments of over seven figures handled by the same adviser  i   m not too happy with the total results or the fees  what is your opinion of splitting my holdings   say        or one third two thirds   with another adviser  it   s wise  at the least  to consider a change   many people  even in the face of excessive fees or poor results  are reluctant to fire an adviser  typically because they have formed a personal connection   but this particular solution   dividing your assets   isn   t the best of ideas to start  you could end up paying more in fees than you are now  says  michael kitces  director of wealth management at pinnacle advisory group inc  in columbia  md  breaking your large nest egg into two  relatively  small nest eggs means you might not benefit from the discounted fees that some advisers offer to clients with sizable holdings perhaps more important  how much time do you plan to give the new adviser  six months  a year  more  if you split your holdings just as markets are jumping higher  or tanking   your new adviser   s performance  especially in the short term  might simply be a matter of good  or bad  timing  rather than a reflection of his or her actual abilities and   do you plan to tell the new adviser about all your assets  investors who split their holdings often are hesitant to give a new adviser a full picture of their portfolio  wanting  first  to see how well the new adviser performs with a piece of that portfolio   such an omission is asking for trouble  says  mike piper  a certified public accountant in manitou springs  colo   and author of the oblivious investor blog take taxes  if the new adviser knows about some  but not all  of the investor   s accounts and holdings  recommendations about which type of account  roth  tax deferred  or taxable  to spend from  or contribute to  will be    poorly reasoned     mr  piper says in short  splitting your holdings tends to be problematic     keeping half your portfolio with an adviser who is charging too much and not delivering value is still half too much     mr  kitces says  one alternative  meeting with a financial planner who charges by the hour  such a meeting would allow you to get a fully informed second opinion without having to move any portion of your portfolio  mr  piper says it also would help minimize fees  pay the adviser as needed for guidance  then hire a low cost portfolio management firm to implement the recommendations  i understand that i can get social security   but can change my mind in the first year and return the money  is that rule still valid  if so  and if i decide to do that  what would my monthly benefit be  would it be the benefit i received when i first applied for social security  or would the benefit be based on my new application date  yes  still valid  but  as always  there are wrinkles if you begin collecting social security retirement benefits  and then have second thoughts about your decision  you can withdraw your social security claim and reapply at a future date  says  william jarrett  a public affairs specialist with the social security administration  the catch  this option is available only for the first    months after you become entitled to benefits  after that  it   s off the table   and you can do this only once in your lifetime  if you decide to withdraw your application  you must repay all the benefits you and your family received based on your retirement application  mr  jarrett notes  that includes any benefits your spouse or children received  as well as money withheld from your checks  including medicare premiums  what   s more  anyone who received benefits based on your application must consent in writing to the withdrawal after the withdrawal has been approved  you must file a new application to receive retirement benefits   and that payment amount will be based on the new application date  mr  ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for the wall street journal  and co author of    the wall street journal complete retirement guidebook     his column examines financial issues for those thinking about  planning and living their
