a few years ago i was completely fed up with education i   d spent six years between             on getting two degrees  and after that  i immediately started a business  and during my first two years as an entrepreneur  i also learned a lot but after a while  i thought  who needs education  just start a business or get a job and earn some money  education is just a waste of time and money i stopped reading books  going to conferences  and getting any other education that helped me to become a better entrepreneur  marketer  etc that wasn   t a smart move  for almost two years after that decision  i didn   t see the growth i wanted  personally  spiritually  mentally  financially when i was learning more  i also started earning more  doing more  and achieving more  and when i wasn   t learning anymore  the opposite happened you see  education  learning  knowledge         it   s all perishable  not only do you lose it if you don   t use it  you also lose your knowledge if you don   t improve it  you simply forget that   s what i didn   t get for most of my life  education is not something you accumulate and will remain in your head forever i look at education like food  water  air  exercise  you need a constant supply you also don   t breathe once a year  right  so why do you only read one book a year  it doesn   t make sense  education is critical to your survival the reason is not only personal growth  as benjamin franklin said education is an investment in yourself  one that can pay you more dividends than anything you will ever invest in here are   reasons why i think that   s the case we live in an increasingly complicated world  and there are big consequences when things go wrong it doesn   t matter how smart or talented you are  what matters is how well you can focus on the things that matter you can easily get fired or lose your business in a moment of weakness  one mistake can trigger anarchy  things are far from practical these days how can you make better decisions the quality of your decisions will shape the outcome of your life and career  never underestimate that one decision can change everything  how do you know you   ve made the right decision since i   ve turned to education  i   m switzerland  i never pick teams  i   m never afraid to say i was wrong  and i only look at the truth i can tell you from personal experience  that   s very liberating education opens your mind and more importantly  it increases your opportunities  people who are closed minded and stick to what they know  will never change  and change is the forward driving force of life by educating yourself  you might think about things you   ve never thought of before  and you will be exposed to ideas you   ve never heard about combine those things together  and you have enough ideas and opportunities for a lifetime i   ve written down     ideas for articles in my note taking app  most of them with an outline  i also have dozens of business ideas  i bet there are       or maybe even   good ideas in there    how do you get ideas     i get the ideas when i learn new things  it   s not like going to the toilet or anything  you don   t have to force it out of you  it just comes naturally oh yeah  you need to learn new stuff every day     shit  that   s tough     yes  i know there are typically two types of job applicants number   is just an addition to your staff  number   is someone you need  which one would you hire there are also two types of entrepreneurs entrepreneur   creates commodities  the other entrepreneur creates products services that are unmissable how do you become entrepreneur number    you guessed it  become so good that people depend on your goods or services how  you guessed it again  learn  practice  be great you can lose everything you   ve gained in life  your money  job  clients  reputation  house  car  and even the people you love the only possession you will never lose  you guessed it again  knowledge  if you keep investing in it  that   s why i buy all books and courses that are relevant to me  that   s why i also spend most of my free time on learning new things  going to new places  and meeting interesting people in the end  the true reason i invest so much time and money on my education is because it   s a survival strategy people hate uncertainty  me too  and education is your safety net  don   t get    education    and    degrees    mixed up  it   s education that matters  not degrees  it   s not easy  in fact  learning  studying  getting degrees  mastering skills  are all one of the hardest things in life and that   s exactly why most people don   t do it thanks to the information revolution of the past decades  you have all the opportunity in the world to learn more to me  it   s madness if you   re not investing in your self education every single day  i prioritize learning over everything in life  i   m not just trying to make a point i actually prioritize education over food  relationships  health  clothes  and the other things of life  you know why  if i don   t  the other things are not as good and it   s very simple  my goal is to read learn practice just    minutes a day that   s not a lot to ask for  right  because if you don   t have    minutes to spend on your education  what kind of life do you have education is important  we know that by know  we just have to do it every day  and love it but like with many things in life  we don   t do the things we know  especially not in the long term everyone can get started  very few persist the way i see it  there are only two options  you learn or you die abraham maslow put it best i   ve got my mind made up  which one do you choose originally posted on dariusforoux com hey  i   m darius foroux  and
