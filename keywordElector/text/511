articles when triathlon runs in the family             tj loftus faced the problem of many triathletes  time away from family  so he got his family hooked on triathlons  too the loftuses have traveled as far away as florida to compete in the swim bike run events  nine family members   tj and wife kristen  their four children  two spouses and a nephew   finished the xterra mountain championship in beaver creek  colo   in july  the race announcer even remembered them from previous years    now that everybody lives in different places  it does make it fun to go on vacation and do something   earn the rest  earn the spa weekend of recovery     says mr  loftus  a    year old dentist in sturgis  s d     we   ve raised the bar on our vacation    people across the country have made triathlon a family sport  with relatives prodding each other in training and children competing with or even against parents  it   s another part of the growth of triathlon  driven largely by avid amateurs who turn the sport into a lifestyle    leslie knibb of washington  d c   coaches triathletes and competes in triathlons herself  she has done more than    with her daughter   taylor knibb  an    year old freshman on the cross country running team at cornell university    every once in while i sort of question     am i crazy     i know that a lot of my gal pals are not doing this     leslie knibb says      taylor  and i sort of look at each other and say     i   m not crazy  are you        taylor knibb says the three  to four hour training bike rides she and her mom do are safer than solo rides because two people are more visible to cars  the rides also have helped her and her mom talk more openly  she says    there   s something different about talking to someone when you   re not necessarily making eye contact     taylor knibb says     it   s like when you   re in a car with someone instead of at a table  more stream of consciousness  you let more things out      doug gould says he was    full of himself    after running a fast time in a   k race earlier this year when he called to tell his    year old daughter he wanted to try a triathlon  her reply     that   s on my bucket list    so mr  gould  a decorative lighting salesman in agoura hills  calif   signed up both of them for the sept     nautica malibu triathlon  a half mile swim     mile bike ride and   mile run   morgan gould  a    year old accountant  lives about an hour from her dad  in santa monica  they mostly train separately and text one another about their progress mr  gould is competitive     if she does a little bit longer bike ride  i   ll do a longer bike ride     he says  but he and ms  gould say they plan to cross the triathlon finish line together    i just think it   s really cool to be able to do this with my dad     ms  gould says     at age     not many people are in as great shape as he is    the nautica malibu triathlon doesn   t have a family division  but the number of people entering with others of the same last name has more than tripled since       to      a race representative says the santa barbara triathlon in california has an option that lets parents accompany children as young as   or    through each part of the race  a     yard swim    mile bike and   mile run  event director  joe coito says he tells parents their child should be comfortable swimming alone in the pacific ocean  even though parent and child swim together emphasis is on participation  no prizes for top finishers are given in the parent child division and results are listed in alphabetical order  the number of people in the category has more than doubled since it was launched in      to     this year  mr  coito says on the other hand  usa triathlon   s addition of a family nationals category at its club championships in june fizzled when only a handful entered the category in the loveland  colo   race  usa triathlon doesn   t plan to stage family nationals again  a spokeswoman says   cassidy hemp nonetheless said she loved the experience of competing as a team with her father  brendan  they won the father daughter category for a combined age of    years old or younger  racing separately and adding their times together ms  hemp  a    year old sophomore at the university of colorado  boulder  says following her father into triathlon competition was    one of the greatest decisions i made in my life     she was a runner and soccer player when she decided to train for triathlon to help overcome a hip injury triathlon training has helped her diversify her workouts  and adding swimming has helped her breathing when she sings  that helped her get into music school  where she majors in vocal performance  she says  she is also on colorado   s champion triathlon club team    i actually prefer to train with my dad than my friends  because my dad has so much more experience  and he   s so much smarter about what he does     she says more on people and their workouts from the wall street journmr  hemp  who at age    has done dozens of triathlons  says he helps his daughter with bike adjustments  he also give her tips on swimming technique    either me or one of my friends will tell her that her arm is still coming out too far on the swim  too wide     he says     she takes it to heart    if there is a downside to family triathlon competition  it   s that it forces parents to face their own athletic mortality ahead of georgia   s tall pines sprint triathlon in may   seth waltman of athens  ga   challenged his    year old son  ben  to beat him on the first leg of the race  a     meter swim  if he did it  his father said  he would buy ben new racing wheels for his bike sure enough  he beat his dad out of the water    it felt good     ben says mr  waltman is still faster than his son in a full race   for now     i know my days are numbered     he says     when i   m    and he   s    or     he   s basically going to have a man   s body  i may not be able to beat him then     write to rachel bachman at rachel bachman wsj com
