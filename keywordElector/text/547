this transcript has been automatically generated and may not be      accurate     from the opinion pages of the wall street journal     this is potomac watch is     now     the aisle policy down     and college     welcome i m posing go by in new york and it was my colleague joe rego the morning joe at all and kim straw soul     and washington were talkin about to talk today about the republican     risks     that emerging of big bigger risk than even i heretofore of between the republicans in congress and on proper tickling speaker the house paul ryan     and i would prompt a response by going rogue     or     broker     of     he has even been     he s now says in a tweet he s gonna be on shackled     i m not sure what he was before but we will will     talk with and then some other new wikileaks e mails on the week and so     joe i m     the speaker the house decides     it tells his conference on monday     that he is going to     not campaign with donald trump     and     i m not defend donald trump status is in focus his efforts in the next thirty days on electing     the majority back of the house and senate     as smart strategy or now     well     i don t think they re any good options in this case so i think he s making the best of     of what he can do if you look at the house district     about a third of them are     very pro trump thirty or next and third are very anti crime     i in in places you wouldn t expect like the counties outside of milwaukee     in in wisconsin for example so     he s sort of he s he s got this problem which is that     trump     is not trying to expand its appeal he may be hurting     a republican chances in some of these districts the march and once that determine the majority     and they ve seen in their internal polling and as wallis public polling     i ve that trump is starting to be an anchor     on on a lot of these districts that people don t like trump are going to vote     you     are going to vote for a republican for in the house or senate seat     so i think they determined that there was a crisis here in eight they had to do something had to do something different     and don t so you don t think this was whiny and himself this was done without the support of the leadership of house clear that they re certainly an element of     political calculation here is as well as principles i mean the the material that emerged     that the candid camera tapes of of     trying making these lewd comments i think     probably really did     offend paul ryan and he is the sort of had to     foreigners conscience or whatever you call well but that s my question was this is the main is kevin mccarthy import this is the rest of the leadership of borders tourist and paul ryan just saying look this is     partly my con con     partly political calculation     i know well enough to know that that probably both     of but     it is he up there on his own     no i don t i don t think so yes this is this is     pretty well supported and house leadership especially in the senate     heavily supported in the senate everybody is with him and senate there s no question about that     i mean that they re certainly internal dissent within the house republican conference but     what else is new     read     it tends to be from the trump ian wright     and protectionist like dinner or bacher for example some of the sum of the comes with a super concert difference over strategy and how to approach situations i mean this is this is nothing i think the leadership is fairly united     in yet employers go get going again     i mean that     in rate was very outspoken in his     much talked about conference call which     may overstate this and agree     the number of members to fall into that camp lot of people on the color or by and     one minus two minute they are the     silent majority that     probably has the tacit approval of why running is proposing here     also to know where the on call that another person who spoke     at paramount group walton who is from the national republican congressional committee which is charged with     a lacking in re electing     republicans to heat up a bit about what they re buying a new districts that some of the incident alarming     while there is so high it is indeed alarming them a lot of supporters on iot to underneath and some of the republicans in swing districts     but here s my question     be it is it s a given all of that and given the degree to which     we know that there is the last ticket splitting in elections     then they use to be we know it s more partisan balloting you vote     for one party top to bottom     given that     it is this a mistake by paul ryan now at this juncture he already endorsed him     cody is done could he wouldn t be smarter     instead of making this announcement in what was a private     conference call but there s no such thing as a private conference call with members of congress     you might as well be announcing it on that on     national television     the the the the the but what he would be better estimate mitch mcconnell steel which is key criticized trial for the     for the for the video     of but he s keeping quiet he didn t even talk about trumpet     and he s focusing on the senate races so nice     and and and therefore     as not to antagonize trump voters     and now we re seeing that elaine ryan and risking that the antagonism of trump voters     yet i e a     t and eric garner might ve been a wise strategy     now i think they beat you talk to to ryan s team they probably would argue that     up what they were     not working they were trying to do split the difference here and that     this video came out communication that eu have     republicans for our any dish of bowing trump and revoking their endorsements and so ryan said very clearly here it is not pronounce things interesting he simply wasn t going to be actively campaigning for trump anymore     course the problem with that it is that     you know mr trump doesn t     see any lines that their     honor and has decided he s going to     declare war on     the line and again start     bashing on everyone he calls the republican establishment     i m running against them as much as he s running against     the very clever     so i e guys causes deep divide in yet i think it probably would have been smarter to just     we ve got to say anything more     beyond what ryan said he was very     critical of trump s statements     and highly highly critical any canceled an event in wisconsin and dis invited trump from an event in wisconsin saturday     yet it up     you know how to     get at it over that but i see it nonetheless they probably couldn t forest along without the us open break this is     usually exacerbated and not the problem     but that there for all of these candidates is that     at the candidates themselves are being put position where     at the me feel as though the their owners feel as though they have to make a decision about our day     with paul ryan a with donald trump and an on the basis of that potentially bow or not     then you can live and think of a point that maybe this was mishandled     in a certain way and in this big conference call that were surely     on that read reopening this this riff     on the other hand there are re who he     really meant nothing you can mount on the call     in terms of their bit of paul ryan s actual position he s he s always said look     we ve got a binary choice i would prefer a republican president to a democratic one because otherwise our attendance going nowhere right     and when it comes to trump     i m gonna criticize him on the merits     when necessary     and they re they re really hasn t been a     change from a man just maybe     i m more releasing     the members     to work there will     just explode the yen and     i you know the more i think about this more but the timing of the public statement a conference call was inevitably going to be interpreted as a rejection of top     even if it and i agree with you that the central nature     campaign it with nothing new in terms of information you     aam     but     it s     especially after he canceled the event on saturday     but um     but no this has created an opening for     and we ve seen now he is responding with a twitter storm     first eagle yesterday saying     ryan needed to spend more time     working     on congress and less time running against him     and this morning he had to twitter storm saying essentially as you said kim declaring war on rye and say i m i m shackled     now from the with the feeling republican leadership     and i know i know like in all i can run the kind of campaign that i ve always wanted to run     so aam     i mean     the diesel oil he was he reading somebody else s campaign before that s what i wanna know what we what kind of campaign was there any app i was i was is certainly wasn t anybody s it wasn t him it was a prepackaged off some shelf     is the most unique it s the it s the it s it s there s been no campaign like it in american history     who else was that     one factor that can be     very civil     disciplined     and     organized     well prepared on a lot of people on the ground knocking on goers lee     that is just thirty eight see what the fed has     run the cat was more to do things for america that i wanted to dealer and you can bring things to america but     it s the same point which was     you know which i he is supposedly donald trump appropriated from paul ryan     the republicans that he felt comparable with     i he s been pretty much is aam and since a starter as     well and then on that point on the substance amid the the the probably the sharpest disagreements that the trend has been policy with ryan and most of the republican conference in the house would be     traded     and     and foreign policy     and when ryan the republicans put together a better way plan     which is an agenda for governing next year     they ve deliberately avoided trade and they avoided foreign policy so as not to of immigration to an immigration other than defense spending     they did talk about defense     and they did that deliberately so as not to not to ratify all of     of the presidential race and they were hoping     the trump board endorsed or group obamacare health care policies for example their energy up to the tax     sees education policy     the outcome never has endorsed that better we plan to     no we has and i mean it that made every effort to accommodate his unconventional politics and that has not been     reciprocated and that that the thing about this is what s owed on for trump is     the voters he needs right now are those     of the paul ryan republicans     they re sort of that it s just normal suburban republicans there are nine     intensely political date they just want some young reasonable     on center right     governments and if he goes to war with paul ryan now     those of the voters he needs to carry in the last twenty days and he this is not going to help them     one at them at least to that question     will see obviously how this plays out in the in the coming days but could this be     the kind of the where were trump says okay if i m not going away     i m basically going to burn the church     and i m going out of my way in which means i don t care i ll take everybody down with me     there was always that     the danger was cut because as he became     his politics is so personal     he seems to fit it and so if     he is sees himself as a loser     ten fifteen point you can almost see him saying     one of the campaign for the rest of the king and can tell two weeks i give up     you know this is a waste of time spending no more money     you know you would see him go something like that i mean when you were ever come failed in his business ventures he cut at the last moment said he got out at the exact right time     i d see no reason why we do that for politics as well     i think this is why i think that     we     were     laughing about though is is remarkably important this for lunch     is it so my shackles and taking out because now i can buy for america the way i want it     so     dinning i agree with the question that     were there republicans in the campaign that were responsible for     mr trump s more     that can t     studious be here over the last month     and that she is actually down in teasing paul ryan also just decided that you can do all of them overboard in taking any of their bias     is it so that that s the only hint of what he said that     he found this can call and he s going to allow the way he wants to do     well if if it s true that the reports of     the snow     joined at the gym     everyday with steve and     the bright part to the     calm sea you join the campaign and kelly and timely     if that is is now abandoned is essentially the main advisor     that is     that suggests it precisely wichita connected and has the populist right he s the he he he in great part     eight the iranian they hate the congressional leadership that he traditional conservatives     and if that s the case for them as this could be a scorched earth policy against     um against the republicans as well as democrats would bode very ill     because it means that the probably the republic certainly the republicans would lose the senate in that case     they may very well lose the house     what is it just does not look very good for a party to be     at war with itself     in the last stretch of the campaign i mean that     that s     just so basic politics that sounds dumb saying     of but     but here we are     yelp     i m alright     i were to have to watch is as we go one other thing before we     leave today one talk about hillary clinton you back to wikileaks the for of     e mails from john augustus     account the key to the clinton campaign manager     back and forth the clearly the somebody leaked it to somebody impacted probably the russians     the u s government s thinks it s the russians     and what are they telling us kim about about the campaign     well why i say or are they who gained their     war we would expect our own     meanwhile a traditional campaign talk about how you handled this moment this crisis or where you position yourself     that is a couple though that stand out that a very interesting     one in which ecb can appease nervousness over hillary clinton     potentially alienating more upset elizabeth warren     the massachusetts senator     over certain questioned and receiving laugh the whole idea of financial reform     i so clearly a lot of receiving many emails to about how to handle bernie sanders it sectors of     the campaign positioning itself to make sure that the eu renamed to collect which is an acknowledgment of what forced     to become the party     i m in it so that is one of the     campaign officials to news about her difficulties in and     tackling different republican potential nominees that     the discussion that we know grass for a liberal chance with the donald trump he become the nominee which of course he did     on one that is just breaking which i think he is actually very interesting email from a spring in which it looks as though     clinton spokesman campaign spoke with the     department of justice officials     about the released of when her e mails     come out     from     the fascinating     i like the many grunwald concern that the the the if they did not to do that the glass steagall     reinstatement that wouldn t offend     elizabeth warren i think that in the and they didn t endorse glasspiegel     the campaign to dump but it did put in the platform     and i think that there s a there s a question     in my mind about the degree to which     a claim president clinton would be really worried about lows but one would defer to her on abe s economic questions     yet it is really taken on the shape of the     post obama party which is not     bill clinton s democratic party     i think you know that there s kind of     hope among some on the right that she would be more hawkish than obama i d i don t     really see that happening     given this the the contents of an antiwar and     anti anti terror     movement on on on the left     it certainly on economic policy mean cheese she rolled out a new tax credit today     for for childcare and one more just get it in under the wire     for thus     before the kids in advance the ni danilo there was a cool one of the son of one of these one of the staffers wrote an email were making a reference to the     grassroots democrats as the red army     who i am because they were given the the the gambling her from the laughter so much chicken     yet knowing     that eric the target     in this room that does not come out well or will be able to do     is apply to the meals exposing the incredibly cozy relationship between the clinton campaign and a lot of quilt mainstream reporters     on which are likely to customers bears out there among them     in reference to phrases that     any york times reporter     judith politico at the time this spring i knew her time saying     you always when i will never let sit down     let them play the story for     you is     that my hegemony everett     neighbor     so in it and there are a     number
