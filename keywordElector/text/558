articles exit the king review the lighter side of death            madison  n j   whatever happened to  eug  ne ionesco  nothing  really   he   s still one of the most important and influential playwrights of the postwar era   but his plays are now rarely seen on the new york stage  only two of them have been done on broadway in the past quarter century  neither successfully  and the      production of    exit the king    only got there in the first place because of the presence in the cast of  susan sarandon  who  like most movie stars who take belated shots at broadway  ended up not being much good   hence it is thrilling news that the shakespeare theatre of new jersey has opened an impressive production of    exit the king     and that    rhinoceros    will be mounted off broadway by the pearl theatre company later this season  two stagings do not a revival make  but if the pearl   s    rhinoceros    is anywhere near as fine as  bonnie monte   s staging of    exit the king     it   ll bode well for ionesco   s american prospects   exit the king   shakespeare theatre of new jersey  f m  kirby shakespeare theatre     madison ave   madison  n j                          closes aug     ionesco  who died in       was one of the european writers whose work inspired the expression    theater of the absurd     and    exit the king     first performed in       displays his method at its most potent  it shows us the last    minutes of the life of king berenger the first   brent harris   a     plus year old monarch who lives in a crumbling castle  he knows the hour of his death   he   s probably always known it   but has chosen to pretend that it   ll never come  preferring to frolic with his nubile young mistress  jesmille darbouze  instead of facing the inevitable with suitably regal dignity     why was i born     he asks     if it wasn   t forever     then queen marguerite   marion adler  and his doctor   greg watanabe  inform him that he will die    in an hour and a half   at the end of the show     all at once his hair turns white and his body starts to disintegrate  and after trying for a little while longer to keep on pretending that nothing is wrong  king berenger gives in and accepts marguerite   s offer to help prepare him for the dark rendezvous     i   ll help him  i   ll cut him loose  i   ll untie every knot and ravel out the tangled skein    if that sounds like grim stuff  that   s because it is  ionesco   s purpose in writing    exit the king    was to provide the viewer with  in his words     an apprenticeship in dying    this seems to me to be the most important thing we can do  since we   re all of us dying men who refuse to die     but he chose to couch his memento mori in the form of a black comedy set in a tumbledown kingdom not unlike the marx brothers    freedonia  salting the shenanigans with bluntly poetic words of warning     we haven   t the time to take our time     aimed both at the king and at the audience  all the way up to the wrenching last scene  when the clock runs out on berenger  it   s as if dante   s    purgatorio    had been rewritten as a farce it isn   t hard to find contemporary relevance in    exit the king     and the      broadway revival  directed by  neil armfield and starring  geoffrey rush  underlined it to excess by using a new translation by messrs  armfield and rush that was modernized  vulgarized and generally dumbed down  ms  monte  by contrast  has chosen to let ionesco   s masterpiece speak for itself  returning to  donald watson   s now standard      english language version and setting the action in a straightforwardly rendered gothic throneroom   the only modern touch is the boom box from which the    derisive rendering of regal music    that sets the play in motion blares forth   she has also judiciously trimmed the script in order to bring the running time down to the    minutes specified by marguerite  a shrewd decision that improves its dramatic flow  otherwise  ms  monte gives us    exit the king    as is  trusting in ionesco and her marvelous cast to get the job done without gratuitously    clever    directorial intrusions   and that they do  i can   t imagine a more effective production  or a more poignant one the performances of mr  harris and ms  adler are  of course  the heart of the matter  he   s a zany pseudo monarch  she   s flinty and tough  and they strike sparks off each other like an old married couple who   ve played and replayed their favorite domestic scenes so many times that they know them backwards  mr  rush   s performance was spectacular  but mr  harris owes no apologies  and ms  monte   s staging is superior in virtually every other way to the broadway revival  if you   ve never seen a ionesco play   or a production by the shakespeare theatre of new jersey  whose consistent excellence has become a byword   then now   s the time    mr  teachout  the journal   s drama critic  is the author of    satchmo at the waldorf     which opens on aug     at b street theatre in sacramento  calif   and starts previews on aug     at mosaic theatre in washington  d c  write to him at
