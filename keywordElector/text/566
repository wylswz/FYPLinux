articles remains review using art history to shape bodies            brooklyn  n y  john jasperse has been working with his own groups of dancers since       intriguingly blending pedestrian activity with frequently sensual  formal arrangements  often with matter of fact gender reversals  along the way  he has created    evening length works  four have been featured in the brooklyn academy of music   s annual next wave festival  each took shape as often spare but compellingly calibrated movement within settings as visually unusual as their elements were essentially plain   expanses of dangling plastic coat hangers  collections of plastic water bottles  and tangles of orange electrical cords linger memorably from the         misuse liable to prosecution    last week  the    year old choreographer   s latest work  the hour long    remains      co commissioned by bam and the american dance festival  where it had its premiere in july   helped kick off this year   s next wave festival  mr  jasperse eschews explanatory program notes for bam  but his  john jasperse projects website says the six dancer work    explores how the remnants from our actions that remain in our wake create a context for the future     the dancemaker says in a bam website video that    remains    evokes both    residue    and the    act of remaining    in the video mr  jasperse flips through such sources from art history as those depicting madonna and child and pieta imagery and what he calls lounging nudes  at a bam talk  the choreographer mentioned any number of well known images  confirming what i recognized when i saw    remains    two days earlier   that the recumbent pose taken by  maggie cloud at the start was that of the    sleeping hermaphroditus    sculpture known from roman copies  as to his audiences    awareness of these specific references   i identified configurations from botticelli  raphael and canova  as well as poses from  matisse paintings and sculptures  not to mention groupings suggesting compositions familiar from depictions of the descent from the cross or the entombment of christ   mr  jasperse added that while his dance was    rife with citations     it    really didn   t matter if  audiences  know what they are    within the bam harvey   s cavernous stage space     remains    starts handsomely but somewhat uneasily  the setting devised by mr  jasperse and lenore doxsee has a glassy floor framed  box like  by four wide slats that glow in ms  doxsee   s vivid lighting  ms  cloud  reclining center stage in one of baille younkman   s trim  stylish costumes  appears asleep after she is revealed by the slow rise of the front curtain while the house lights remain up and the last audience members file in  we   re left puzzling  has the performance begun  should we stop conversing  eventually  once the auditorium dims  a good six minutes into this start     remains    proceeds to draw us into its animated poses as well as to its sustained movements that delicately recycle or echo previous dances  recalling mr  jasperse   s own works as well as moments from  perhaps   martha graham  lucinda childs  merce cunningham and  vaslav nijinsky  during his talk  mr  jasperse said he was bemused by a review that said he   d made reference to the body language of igor  the lab flunky in mel brooks   s    young frankenstein    john king   s electronic music comes and goes  with the intermittent bouts of silence feeling at least as dramatic as the eerie  metallic reverberations  at times the witty side of mr  jasperse surfaces  particularly as the score  with additional music by  javier peral  nino rota and    mile vacher  injects old world  popular airs into the sometimes stark poetics of the choreography  when  for example  the action presents all six dancers tripping over the stage in geometric patterns  the mood turns gently giddy  elsewhere  for duets that incorporate the physicality of wrestling entanglements  the sheer gravity of the moves adds gravitas to the proceedings finally  about    minutes in  just as    remains    feels as if it   s repeating itself without elaborating on its recycled elements  the full cast re enters in spangled versions of their simply cut costuming  three dancers take center stage and remain in place  the other three pace the perimeter  all the while  over some of mr  king   s more sharp and spare sounds  we hear mr  jasperse prompting his dancers to move    back    or    forward    the three traveling dancers at the margins most noticeably follow these cues  advancing and receding accordingly  the three stationary dancers heed these commands more subtly  internally   shifting in place almost imperceptibly  while their costumes glint in the fading light  their actions embody the very motivations of    remains     we see their back and forth moves as a reminder of the looking back mr  jasperse did to head into the future  mr  greskovic writes about dance for the journal
