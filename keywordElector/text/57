a guy she just met onlin a few day ago not onli do you see mani pretti face girl in real life but onlin a well take a minut to skim through your connect profil on facebook googl pinterest instagram medium and i bet you most of the girl you ve check out have no shame gal have makeup on i too am the veri same but there s a reason whi i do let me walk you through my life so you can see how i start chang how i look it struck me in middl school the one thing all girl hate go through ye puberti even though my arm start grow out faster than my leg did i wa not concern with my look at all i pretti much wore anyth my mom bought me super discount cloth from ross and maci s that were either overs or unfashion i kept the same hairstyl for year a straight horizont cut i didn t shave my leg embarrassingli to say i just didn t give a damn what peopl thought but then i chang in high school almost everi singl girl wore makeup and usual a swarm of guy would surround her from everi side like hungri custom do when they spot a delect look food sampl at costco these girl were pure eye candi for the guy and they drove all the attent away from girl who unfortun couldn t do makeup sadli to say i wa one of those girl now i m pretti sure most of you have felt thi at one point dure your high school a struggl to belong a struggl to be accept by those you want to be with and you know high school is the time where everyon ha their own nich group to be with you got the popular the jockey the normal the nerd the booksmart one the gamer and the loner for girl it wa all about get into the popular group and in order to get in you had to wear makeup that wa my goal with that i grab everi singl dollar and coin from my mini bank box save up from the past three year and head straight to the shop mall to check out all makeup brand m a c loreal shiseido chanel dior lanc me you name it worth of cosmet no hold back ka ching my mom a the conserv she is freak out when she found me pull out these expens brand cosmet one by one from my huge stash into the bathroom i expect a respons like thi after all she s the type that never buy anyth on regular price it would either have to be on sale clearanc or be coupon usabl if i gave her the slightest clue on my plan i would have noth so i said noth the next morn i pick up a brush and an eye shadow palett it wa time to be a new me i stroll across where all the popular girl hang out my head held high the chatter stop head turn oh yeah thi makeup realli work like a charm what wa onc silenc suddenli erupt into snicker which then explod into ear bleed laughter my heart immedi sunk whi were they laugh i race to the bathroom and look at my reflect my makeup had smear all over my eye like a beat up panda i look just aw the bell rang class wa start yet i linger in the bathroom til no one wa around walk home and lock myself in my room for the rest of the day after mani pain attempt of put on makeup thank to observ girl like michel phan and fromheadtoto do their makeup on youtub i final succeed i knew thi becaus a random guy came up to me one day while i wa groceri shop and told me how pretti my face look it felt good to final be abl to do makeup right from that point on i wore makeup everyday even if it wa just work out at the gym a my whole day s plan rain or shine makeup made me feel confid strong happi and when you come

girl who can t do makeup girl who don t wear makeup at all or guy particularli those who struggl to get a girl or it could be from someon who truli see the beauti of the person pa their makeup mask as much a i would love more peopl in the world like that there s onli a tini fraction of them around most peopl are shallow and i hate to say thi but first impress is everyth and by first impress it s all about how the person look i wish the world didn t emphas beauti a someon who need to pat layer of powder on her face and appli fake lash on her eye the onli reason whi makeup store exist and whi so mani girl wear makeup whether they go all out like effi trinket from hunger game or keep it minim with just foundat is becaus our societi posit reinforc them we encourag them posit reinforc includ and these are just a few of the hundr of perk you can get by wear makeup some girl take makeup to their full advantag to obtain all those perk i don t blame them though they re onli do what they could do to live a better life and you know everyon look for way to benefit themselv too i mean if you can find a shortcut to succeed in life without harm yourself or other i m pretti sure you would well makeup is one of those hidden shortcut you might think it s a deceit tool for a girl to cheat her way in life and get what she want but i see it give more light than dark the onli harm it can possibl do is make other girl feel insecur but hey that s someth they have to deal with other than that use makeup if you truli feel confid and happi and it make your life easier do what you got to do to make
