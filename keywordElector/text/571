articles this brain exercise puts off dementia           one particular type of mental exercise may succeed at doing what nothing else has before  putting off dementia  a new     year study showed that speed training   computer exercises that get users to visually process information more quickly   beat out memory and reasoning exercises  two other popular brain training techniques  researchers found that a total of    to    hours of speed training has the potential to cut by as much as     the risk of developing dementia    years later the results of the study  called active  for advanced cognitive training in vital elderly  were presented sunday at the alzheimer   s association international conference in toronto  the world   s largest gathering of alzheimer   s researchers  the study is believed to be the first to demonstrate that a behavioral intervention can reduce the incidence of dementia  many people practice various brain training exercises to keep the mind limber as they age previous research released as part of the active study showed all three types of brain training tested led to improvements in cognitive function and the ability to perform daily living skills  such as preparing a meal  speed training topped the other techniques in reducing the incidence of at fault car crashes and forestalling declines in health  and was the only intervention to protect against symptoms of depression    if you can reduce the chance of getting dementia by nearly     with this  that   s huge     says  michael roizen  chairman of the wellness institute at the cleveland clinic  who wasn   t involved in the study  the study  which was funded by the national institute on aging and the national institute of nursing research  included       healthy subjects  ages    to     at six study sites around the u s  participants were randomized to get one of the three cognitive training programs or be in a control group  memory and reasoning training were done with an instructor  not on a computer  and didn   t cut the risk for developing dementia the speed training participants had    one hour training sessions over five weeks with an instructor on hand for help  some had booster sessions a year later and three years later  participants getting only the initial    hours of training had on average a     lower risk for developing dementia    years later  whereas those who received the additional sessions reduced their risk by      the data is considered preliminary because it hasn   t yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal   jerri edwards  director of the school of aging studies and byrd alzheimer   s institute at the university of south florida  who presented the data and led the most recent analysis  says the researchers wanted to disclose the findings as soon as possible brain training games have been a big business for years  that has sparked pushback from some scientists skeptical of claims manufacturers made  including that the products could reduce or reverse cognitive decline  the federal trade commission earlier this year settled a    million deceptive advertising lawsuit against lumos labs  charging that the company was making false claims of protecting against dementia and age related cognitive decline in its brain training program lumosity     for the majority of brain fitness products sold today the marketing hype has exceeded the science     says  murali doraiswamy  director of the neurocognitive disorders program at duke university health system in durham  n c     the active results will definitely provide a big credibility boost to the field     dr  doraiswamy says  but the study also raises questions about how much speed training is optimal  he says  adding that further research would be needed to replicate the results  it isn   t clear whether speed training affects the neurophysiological processes that cause dementia  says  glenn smith  chairman of the department of clinical and health psychology at the university of florida  in gainesville  who has done independent research with similar products  but at minimum they can help    people develop reserve or resilience in the face of whatever brain changes are happening that would lead to dementia     he says  the exercise used in the study was developed by researchers but acquired by posit science  of san francisco  in       a more user friendly version of the game  called double decision  is now part of the company   s brainhq online service  a cognitive training program  a monthly subscription  which includes access to double decision  is     a month  or     a year  posit science says the company intends to file a medical device application to the food and drug administration based on the recent clinical trial findings in double decision  users must identify an object at the center of their gaze and simultaneously identify an object in the periphery  as players get correct answers  the presentation time speeds up  distractors are introduced and the targets become more difficult to differentiate speed training is designed to improve the speed and accuracy of processing visual information and expand the useful field of view  or ufov   the visual area over which a person can make quick decisions and pay attention without moving the eye or head  ufov decreases with age and is associated with a decline in performance on daily tasks  particularly driving a car dr  edwards  who presented the study findings  disclosed that she worked as a consultant to posit science for a few months in      to analyze data and prepare a publication  following the active study  dr  edwards says the next step would be a trial to determine the optimal dose of training and understand how it affects the brain  such a trial would take people at risk for developing dementia and give them the training to see if it prevents development of the disease    dementia by definition involves functional impairment     dr  edwards says     so if we   re improving people   s everyday functional performance    through speed training  their likelihood of developing dementia may go down    the potential to benefit is great and the risks are none to minimal     she says  she recommends people start speed training beginning at age     write to sumathi reddy at sumathi reddy wsj com
