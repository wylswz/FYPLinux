old and  each year  take my required minimum withdrawal from my     k  with vanguard  my wife has a     b  plan with a different investment firm  she is    years old and needs to begin withdrawals this year  her investment firm representative mentioned that since we file jointly on our tax return  my wife   s required withdrawal could be made from my     k   is that correct  your wife needs a new investment rep there is no such thing as a    joint        k  or a    joint        b   says  ed slott  a certified public accountant and individual retirement account specialist in rockville centre  n y  when the time comes  participants in retirement plans must make individual withdrawals from their individual accounts   even if a wife and husband file jointly and the combined income goes on the same tax return  so  you must continue to withdraw your required minimum from your     k   and your wife must withdraw her required minimum from her     b  indeed  if you follow the representative   s advice  you could create a nasty tax problem for yourselves  mr  slott says  to start  you would withdraw more than the required minimum from the     k  and end up paying more in taxes  meanwhile  there would be no withdrawal from the     b   failing to take that required distribution would result in a     penalty on the shortfall   if you are supposed to withdraw          the internal revenue service will bill you            investment advisers really need to know the tax rules     mr  slott says     they are managing retirement accounts subject to these rules  that is the bigger story     i have about    million in various retirement accounts  mostly in stocks  i have a real estate rental that is worth about          that is intended to generate income in retirement  in light of all i read about the asset allocation classes of stock  bonds and cash  where would i count the real estate in these models  think of that property as stock to start  the income isn   t guaranteed  as it would be with  say  a certificate of deposit  says  mark maisonneuve  a portfolio manager in farmington hills  mich  yes  you might have a lease and a tenant who makes regular  even increasing  payments  but unexpected expenses to maintain  or in the case of bad tenants  rehabilitate  the property could turn the asset   s return from gain to loss  looking ahead  the sale price of the property   if you or your heirs decide to sell   is completely unknown  there is no creditor pledging to make good on the return of principal on a set date as with a bond in fact  rental property would go into the more speculative part of one   s stock allocation  and requires close attention  mr  maisonneuve adds    landlords consider rentals as safer because they see all the inner workings     he says     but property is never as liquid as many stocks  nor do stocks wake us up in the middle of the night to deal with a crumbling foundation or collapsed sewer drain     i have two questions  if my wife  born in       takes social security before she reaches her full retirement age and continues to work  i understand that her benefits could be reduced temporarily if her salary exceeds certain levels  how does a younger spouse   s full time earnings affect these thresholds  and if i decide to delay claiming social security benefits  how much time needs to pass before i see an increase in my payout  in other words  do benefits increase each month that i wait  or each year that i wait  your first question refers to social security   s    earnings test     and you   re correct  people who collect both benefits and a salary before reaching full retirement age could see their benefits reduced if their income exceeds certain levels the earnings of a spouse aren   t part of this calculation  so if your wife is collecting benefits and earning a paycheck  her salary   and her salary alone   will determine if there is a reduction in her benefits to answer your second question  a person   s social security payout will increase each month that he or she waits to claim benefits   put another way  you don   t have to wait    months for a larger check   let   s say you   re eligible for a benefit of        at a full retirement age of     if you claim benefits at age    and four months  your monthly benefit would total       if you wait an additional month  the payout would be        you can see specific figures  based on your full retirement age  at ssa gov planners retire agereduction html   mr  ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for the wall
