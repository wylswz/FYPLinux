bret stephens and mary kissel     welcome to welcome back to foreign edition     we wake up this morning mary to the     very sad news     and that     shimon peres the     last founding     surviving founding father of israel     passed away at the age of ninety three     he had been president of the country     he has twice been its prime minister     twice its defence minister three times its foreign minister either     high offices     as well     he had won a nobel     peace prize than had been honored by president obama the white house has been     honored by the french with initials and are     only back in the nineteen fifties     the story of his life is in many respects     the story of israel itself     and it s provoking a real outpouring its seems to me     of sympathy and grief for the passing of an     end arguably great     and it s almost impossible to mean you ve you ve summarize his political offices which have been     i e extraordinary although of course the peace accords not and a lasting achievement     unfortunately but     i there s of course the other side of his life which was building the israel and all of the     helping all of the innovative industries of israel     on the falcon helping to found them and also helping them to to flourish and to thrive there was a     neat book out the several years ago by itins sr and sr cnooc or stealer     and i think the young     and all the way as it     ahh and young looking     on if you ve read a book called start up nation and friends played a role in this book where     and to talk about how     the spirit of entrepreneur ship was fostered a new role he played in it so     the blisters up in it that they want to read about that side of his life which isn t     mentioned is often that something that the connection because i knew     i was editor of the jerusalem post     over a decade ago and i came to know them fairly well     i once found myself sitting     next to him on a nine hour plane ride from     joke and a spur to     tell of the     he was reading a book about the history of food     and expense a couple of hours associates of     black saying about agricultural biotechnology about nanotechnology which is a big hobby courses is     and what struck me about the conversation and others with him but that was probably the     most nine hours of the longest single period of time i ever spent with him     was     it was always about the future     he was always about what was coming next     not about     this township for what came before at the time i had this     long ride with him he was     this is a two thousand to so he was seventy nine years old was born in nineteen twenty three     and and that struck me is really     kind of an astonishing and     uplifting part of his personality which was     he dreamed it     and you know there s there s a famous its line from his or her soul the     founding father of modern zionism     he said if you will it is no dream     and     again and again     shimon peres will that he will     israel s     defense industries into existence he will its     nuclear program     into existence     in nineteen seventy six he was minister of     defense     and urged his boss prime minister     sok rabin     to conduct that     famous raid on intended rescued     israeli hostages a determined terrorist group     from     the heart of uganda thousands of miles away from israel     saying that you know if we will if we can in fact     defeat     terrorism     we are not going to be held hostage     to these latter day barbarians     where where i think the dream     got ahead of him tragically it was the big dream of his life     it was peace between israel and the palestinians peace between israel     and its arab neighbors it was     the early nineteen nineties the cold war had ended     yasser arafat had lost a soviet patron     paris was convinced that there was a historical inflection point     and that that was the moment to seize and     paris was prepared     personally to move from being a hawk to adopt     but arafat as palestinian counterpart drop it so that     was never prepared to rise from being a terrorist     to be a statesman and that was the tragedy that was the essential tragedy     of     bad     doomed peace process     of amending it just one more please     which is     um     i think the story of paris s life also shows     how much a single individual can accomplish     in a system     that is sufficiently loose     to allow for dynamic individual nation     you know you ask yourself i mean this guy     and was henry kissinger     and henry stenson     and henry kaiser rolled into one and he could do that because israel as a young country     needed an enterprising spirit not only in its     own     private sector     course at the time is a socialist country had no enterprising spirit and private sector     but it s hardly needed an enterprising spirit in its     among its leaders     simply to survive     the real question a lot of democracy space today is     can you to     invent a word de ossified and our political structures     do you regulate dibi rocker times     in order to make it possible     for     hugely talented man like shimon peres     to from in you he was also a man in the last thing we probably     should should note that there was a great quote from him in this morning s     new york sun our friends that live eu     quoted him saying     we were going to make money like capitalists could spend like social class yes i he was really know     and free markets here and and this was part of the baby wasn t against     it on this is the feigning in his early days     of the the the central spirit of israel     at its birth     was a socialist spirit that     the social economic institution were the key but seeing these collective farms     the entire     reverb movement in israel dominated by david in korean     i was     confuse with the ideals of socialism     communism by the way was never a soviet satellite     but a kind of social democracy     but in the nineteen eighties when israel was facing hyperinflation     i     shimon peres turned to george shultz     and said     what do we get it or talk of course     was     not just a great diplomat but also in the u s secretary of treasury with with     the next administration to run a major corporation     this edition lawn     said george taking by hand     and that s exactly what chalked it     and he helped get israel out of its hyperinflation     he helped turn his role from the socialist economic bill it was     into a thriving capitalist economy you mention that he s created entire industries     the defense in the industry     israel s palaces and the called troll power     the the whole cyber industries that have     flourished in israel in in recent years     he wasn t an ideal up i think that he     he practiced essentially the ap of     you know     if it works     do it     you know     aam is that you     come to hong kong nineteen right side of the hong kong spirit and he wasn t so influx of plea     connected to give an ideology     that he could reinvent itself which i think explain stock just is personal but also has political in jeopardy     so we re gonna miss him i m gonna miss him personally     and um may he rest in pan may he rest in peace makers as     as my ancestors say may his memory be for a plastic     when say a short break     and will be right     i this suppose to go most of the potomac watch podcast join me and my colleagues every week is we dissect all of the latest happenings in washington and on the campaign     check this out and wsj dot com slashed podcast and become a subscriber on i can stitch or spot if i am and who will play music     the wsj s podcast listen ambitiously     from the opinion pages of wall street journal     this is     for an edition     now from our studios in new york     bret stephens and mary kissel     well     we re going to move from israel     and we re going to move about three hundred and fifty miles     i m guessing three hundred four hundred miles     to the north and east of israel the city of aleppo     i don t think even jerry johnson     can be a little snide here     has to ask     what is the lead up anymore     this was     we use to be syria s largest city in its commercial capital     home to the tune a half or so million people     it has been my kaliningrad in the second world war     besieged     for     almost five years     after a another     fragile     makeshift     and jerry rigged cease fire collapsed last week the syrian government     of which are outside with its russian     and iranian allies     have been bombarding the city we incendiary bombs     with bunker busting bombs leaving holes in the ground more than twenty feet deep according to eyewitness accounts     more than ninety children have been killed     over the last weekend in addition to some     several hundred     others     this is the     um     this is the     moral crisis of our time     and     fortunately the obama administration     is so upset about this     that it might consider not talking to the russians     about whether     they should have discussions to perhaps     get together     that kind of ceasefire that has already failed     twice this year     it may be there to walk away from having a discussion with the russians     about whether russia in the united states can team up to fight isis     so that the assad regime can better focus its fire     on civilians resisting outside     rule     in a let up and     i think this is one of the     true lol moments     in american diplomatic and st and     the diplomatic and moral history i would say     the     abandonment of aleppo     and the pretense     that we are prepared to seriously lift     more than simply a diplomatic finger at the yule and if that     to help those people who read themselves or save themselves     from the grip of the     ot is tyranny     and the other attorneys supporting     you have to wonder what happened to the great tradition of liberal     internationalism name each man bryan green leftist human rights groups     ill right you mentioned john kerry threatening to to cough pox when with moscow big deal     but you also had president obama allplay nene     in recent days to vanity fair about     him how syria was really the one being the nice really     you fought hard and down in     in in in really     haven t had a tough time coming coming to grips with few did he do the right pane did not     it s true anything me is that it is that the president     and it has to question this     at all     on the you know what was the calculation here i know we talked about     the these podcast i think it s worth rehearsing     the president essentially     did a nuclear deal with the state sponsor of terrorism and even more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars     in in exchange essentially not is if that wasn t bad enough     agreed to do their bidding in syria because essentially iran backs this up     so we come to this point     where are     on the the the president who was billed as this     great international last um     you know a man of     peace to do the right thing     who wouldn t start the wrong wars     as increased supply stands back and those nothing and pile on top of that is if this were gone bad enough     we have the spectacle     of our investors united nations samantha power who     i     do believe cares about human rights     it has made it three year out of promoting a human rights     i m standing up and essentially parroting what a presence     at the un     you know samantha power un for so i think she s a well intentioned public servant     i think     she has been     the hawkish voice     inside the administration     to do something about syria this is of cos it s entirely driven by     the president     himself     but she is the author     and she did make her name     with an article titled bystanders to janice     about the clinton ministrations     willful self delusion     most quoting her exactly here     in pretending that it was doing something about the genocide unfurling in wind up     in the spring of nineteen ninety four     while in fact it did everything it caused     not to get himself involved in rwanda because     they were worried about the midterm elections because     they didn t wanna get themselves in an african enpro leo because     clinton took a dim view of     of of of touching the the the the rwanda     disaster     and it says stephen article about how     us officials     kept telling themselves well we re doing everything we can within     the broader framework of pe of our international commitments     and     the limits of american power etc cetera     all by way of excusing     what amounted to in a     callable in action     you fast forward to the present and listen to     ambassador power     talking about what s happening in syria in she says     well it s not true or not doing anything for doing everything we can short of war and     were having a great effect on what s happening     against isis     and she sounds exactly like     the officials     she sold roundly     denounced     when she was     young     idealistic writer     and not someone     with her hands on the     onthe wheel so to speak     i am you know i ve resisted     calling for her     resignation     that s probably decision she has to make     the cheap     the onthe do yourself a favor and go back and reread     grown essay from     two thousand and one in the atlantic monthly     and ask itself how she rates     against     the houthis bush dolls for the susan rice is with the other     but administration officials     who fees     who she scored so harshly     in that he s and is it mean that she s learned something or perhaps does that mean     she s learned     it underscores the can rack     up another point that we come back to a new podcast after podcast which is that with out american leadership     it s     you can eat even if     the french or british or others on this the spine     to go into course the don t     on the we are actively discouraging we need american leadership     salt crises like     and in that is the tragedy because if we had     if we had arm the rebels     we hit given minimal support in terms of their support in creating a safe zone     aam we would be nowhere near we are today     and say to make     sense i     think that s fair assessment of may     one final time     topic to cover for today s podcast     all of fifteen     we never do it but you know when it s a header readers hossy gotta get some out     there we need to try and attempt to try and     but it ain t happening um     that     so ninety seven to one     the senate override     aam is     the top     this     jets to     legislatures     justices justice again sponsors of terrorism act     it is an attack that we created some color about to sovereign immunity would allow     americans to sue     saudi arabia for alleged complicity     in nine eleven the really big deal     a big deal meant that the     manager um     i know that we aren t hse     suppose to do nothing but scorn the obama administration     actually him to come to the president s defense     he was right to veto the bill     this bill is dangerous this bill sets a bad precedent     for the future     united situ not try to conduct foreign policy     by way of litigation if you want to conduct the form posse do it by way of the actual policy     it     suggests that saudi arabia was complicit     in the attacks of nine eleven     all the evidence that we have including the released eighteen pages     tells us     that it was not     that s not to say that fifteen out of nineteen of the hijackers were saudis     but there are reasons why     ksm     and the potters of nine eleven     shows saudis not least because     since it was an ally to have an easier time getting visas that they would have to be chosen getting these are some other     much less iraqis for some other     nationality     and we are     gratuitously making an adversary     of a country that at this moment we really need     because our alliances in the middle east are crumbling     saudi arabia     he says the stress     of a depressed     oil     price     which     causes     an     internal     use internal discontent     there is a     new leadership team that is reformist     and open to the west as and as we ve never seen before     but needlessly     the leading them     it s either gonna put further pressure making them not to reform but to resist     and my center the saudis to look for other     patrons and how it s there the chinese there the russians     saudi arabia has options     and this to me strikes me as a good reason why     you should always distrust     congress     was but     often distrust congress     has     done     the fought for form posse making is the reason the founders     gave that job     to the president     adding this is a bad day for american alliances     and i get a status     as a     conservative form posse columnist who has spent     years in years criticizing the president     he was right     to     veto the bill     and congress is wrong to override it     and this is can to make our position in the middle east     worse     and i think it is an attendant at that price     it s also going to put americans in jeopardy because     if the if the united states as well it s fine person this is that this too     i you re going to see other nations     take     action against us     that s only now     and the only people here who will benefit     will be the plaintiffs are lawyers charge big fees to bring these cases and at what folks     it is it s a major cost you to our alliances     and i d i d add to your suspicion of     congress     but you also to be suspicious when you see bills passed     was     a new union     yes i think that s     that s right i think this     is an easy vote to demagogue to voters     yeah let s go get the saudis     we don t like them we don t like their for their bully them with a treat when and if you re a conservative     there s lots not to like about saudi arabia     and eighteen years to the time of such populism in america especially     in such an instinct for isolation     i think that s right and     and of     this is the sort of thing as you pointed out sovereign immunity is important     and just as we     can make     a lift     the     aam guardrails on sovereign immunity     for other countries they will do so for us     and it just brings us into this     increasing world     of disorder     from which     nothing good can     i think you very much for listening and     will get back to you next week we do promise to make     an effort to try to be a little bit more upbeat than a mile left
