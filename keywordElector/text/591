   which added an equivalent camera and waterproofing to its galaxy s  six months ago it   s dumb luck for apple that the iphone   is arriving friday just as samsung faces a bruising recall on the galaxy note    which would otherwise be the simone biles of      smartphones   i still think android users should look to samsung for an upgrade  just wait until the battery issue is fixed  apple trained us to think that every two years we   d be dazzled by a whole new shebang  yet two years after the iphone    it is hard to spot much externally that is different about the iphone    save the new glossy black finish with a diabolical ability to retain fingerprints   seriously  apple designers  do you all wear gloves  but apple offers plenty of reasons to retain our loyalty  it   s improving features that actually matter  it provides unrivaled retail and customer service  its ios remains the most elegant mobile software  and the new version  ios     continues to prove we don   t have to cede the privacy of our emails  photos and to do lists just to get helpful new capabilities  so let   s talk about the other reason you might actually consider skipping the iphone     the death of the headphone jack  apple really blew it when it explained this  the iphone   still comes with corded earbuds  but they plug into the lightning port now instead of the old round plug  and the box comes with an adapter so you can use your old headphones  there   s one big downside  you can   t plug in headphones and the charger at the same time unless you buy another strange adapter   for     while all that is annoying  it   s actually a good time to consider wireless headphones  whose tech has leapt forward recently  in october  apple will begin selling its own      airpods  wireless headphones that look like a cross between earrings and electric toothbrush heads  they are one more thing to worry about charging  and small enough that i could imagine losing them  but i enjoyed using a preproduction version on a plane and in the office   see my deeper dive on the airpods here  so why is it worth losing the jack  apple   s explanation  that it had the    courage    to move audio tech forward  has gone over like a lead balloon  instead of patting themselves on the back  apple   s brass should have stuck to the main message  it freed up a ton of space inside a phone that   s already more packed than a subway car to do more practical things we really want   battery  apple managed to improve performance without changing the size of the phone  the battery capacity is     larger in the    and    larger in the   plus  versus last year   s models  and apple   s new processor  while faster  knows how to turn off portions that aren   t in use to save power in my punishing lab tests  the iphone   lasted    and     hours  the   plus  which has a bigger battery  but also a bigger screen to light  lasted about    hours  both of these were about an hour and     longer than a fresh iphone  s and  s plus  and two and     hours longer than a  s that has been in use for a year bear in mind that in regular use  the plus model always lasted longer than its smaller sibling  while that   s still true  the smaller   got a bigger boost this time and will get more people through the day  if you hammer your iphone with intense apps  you may still need a hideous battery backpack  water resistance  apple has finally owned up to an unfortunate reality  a lot of us drop our phones into swimming pools  hot tubs and  yes  toilets in our tests  the newly sealed up iphone   survived a half hour in a fish tank  a duck pond dunking   even an hour and     in and out of a pool  but i can   t recommend you take it swimming  apple promises only that its phones can live for up to    minutes under a meter of water  and the regular one year hardware warranty won   t actually cover water damage  important  if it does get wet  let it dry out for at least five hours before charging  camera  if you long ago ditched your digital camera for an iphone  i   ve got good news  the biggest improvement in the iphone   is its ability to take pictures in low light  it has a new sensor  wider aperture lens and optical image stabilization on both models  one of the most dramatic examples from my testing is a photo i took of my buddy nate in a dim bar  in the  s shot  you can hardly make out his features  the   shows him smiling and raising a toast compared with the excellent cameras in the samsung galaxy s  and note    i   d say it   s about a draw  in a night shot i took of radio city music hall with both the galaxy s  edge and iphone    you can see that the galaxy handles the dynamic range better  but adds more noise  while the iphone overexposes by holding the shutter open a hair too long the iphone   plus has a larger screen and battery   and two cameras on the back  one for wide shots  the other with a  x lens  it was nice to use when i couldn   t quite get close enough to my subject  though a cheap point n shoot would be able to zoom in much  much more photo buffs are more excited about how that second lens can help create a background blur effect in shots by capturing some depth information  unfortunately  that wasn   t ready for me to test  apple says it will come by the end of the year  speaker  apple squeezed stereo speakers into the phone  doubling the volume it can crank out  that has been remarkably helpful for conference calls   even though call quality is about the same   watching videos in bed and listening to podcasts while in the shower   am i the only one who does that  not all iphone   improvements are quite as big as apple wants us to think  it   s great that they doubled storage that comes on each phone  but it   s still highway robbery that apple makes us pay it for the storage instead of letting us stick in our own microsd cards the home button isn   t actually a button any more   it   s a bit of the screen that just jiggles a little when you touch it  known as haptic feedback  it   s one less moving part to break  but it felt a little fake to me while apple says the     s screen is more colorful and     brighter than past models  i couldn   t really see the benefit outdoors  apple   s iphone   actually lags behind samsung  its lcd has the same old thick border  while samsung   s oled screens go right to the edge  those samsung screens also cram in more than three times the pixels  making them amazing for looking at photos and text  and useful for new inventions like virtual reality on the subject of anxiety  when will we be able to carry an iphone without fearing a cracked screen  surely design guru jony ive doesn   t want us to keep encasing our iphones in rubber is it worth upgrading your two year old  or older  iphone  yes  will many of us want to sell the   next year when apple introduces mr  ive   s   th anniversary edition iphone x deluxe oled in ceramic poppy red  for apple   s sake  i hope so  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
