 on a camera that snaps onto the back of the modular moto z phones the hasselblad true zoom  available for      as of sept     at verizon stores  adds a   x optical zoom  flash and grip that replaces the android   s phone   s limited built in camera  hasselblad is the rolls royce of photography  known for medium format cameras that cost tens of thousands of dollars unfortunately  that expertise in rich  high resolution imagery isn   t evident in this new mr  potato head phone camera system  when i took it out for an afternoon of shooting  i enjoyed being able to zoom in on faraway subjects  but was underwhelmed by the photos  particularly the ones i shot in low light the hasselblad    mod     as motorola refers to these attachments  connects to the back of the phone with focused magnets and relies on the phone for battery power   motorola says the phone has enough juice for     to     photos  it snapped on securely  though i didn   t try dropping it on a hard surface  the built in grip with shutter button made it easier to hold  press a dedicated power button on top of the mod  and the phone   s camera app launches  the mod weighs nearly as much as the phone itself  so you   ll want a pair of cargo shorts to carry both around the biggest issue is that the mod   s    megapixel image sensor measures just       inch   only slightly larger than the sensor built into the phone   s own    megapixel camera  larger sensors not only add more resolution  but allow you to play with depth of field effects  and produce better nighttime photos  for my tests  i compared the hasselblad true zoom with the dxo one  a      camera attachment for the iphone with a   inch sensor and      megapixel pictures  but no zoom lens in bright daytime conditions  the hasselblad   s zoom let me get much closer to subjects like cityscapes and birds that would have otherwise required a drone or some kind of invisibility cloak to shoot  but those photos showed only average dynamic range   shots were relatively washed out  compared with the dxo   s richer ones  at sunset  the hasselblad struggled almost as much as the moto   s built in camera  the hasselblad aperture ranges from f    to f     depending on zoom position the camera app that controls the hasselblad has optimized modes for night landscapes  portraits and even night portraits  you can manually adjust the iso  focus and exposure  but there aren   t complete manual controls that enthusiasts and pros need to get shallow depth of field and other effects motorola says owners will also get free access to hasselblad   s phocus software for editing the camera   s raw images  but it wasn   t available for me to test in theory  the modular phone strategy motorola launched with its z line earlier this year   following the lead of lg   is a good idea  this week  it also announced a    play    edition phone that cuts the price of the z from      to      by shaving some screen and camera quality but for modular phones to be more than just a fad  they need bring functionality that is just not possible on a standard hermetically sealed phone   and ideally can extend the life of a purchase  moto also sells extended battery and tiny projector mods  but a breathtaking camera mod would have really driven home the possibilities hasselblad should have insisted on a better sensor in the motorola partnership  that surely would increase the price  but photographers who hear the name hasselblad hardly expect cheap  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com
