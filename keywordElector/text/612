articles can breathing oils and herbs aid calm and well being            the claim  breathing a mist of essential oils through a device that resembles an e cigarette  or organic herb extracts through a refillable vaporizer  can promote calm and well being  companies say   the verdict  there is at least preliminary scientific evidence for positive effects of many of the essential oils and herbs in the new blends  the aroma of lavender essential oils  for example  has been found to calm people before a medical procedure  however  the bulk of the research has been on ingesting the herbs and oils  not breathing them     if something works in a pill form  does it work in an inhaled vapor type form  the answer is  it   s not known     says  stephen w  bent  a professor of medicine at the university of california  san francisco  dr  brent says a      review article he wrote found valerian root when ingested by mouth    may improve    sleep quality  monq therapeutic air      from monq llc of nashville  tenn   is a sleek looking disposable vaporizer that comes in seven organic essential oil blends  for example  sleepy monq contains lavender  lemon grass and valerian  a lithium battery inside heats the blend  which also has vegetable glycerin that makes a cloudlike mist  a crystal lights up on the end when you take a puff monq recommends not inhaling the mist  but rather breathing it in your mouth and exhaling through your nose  so the aromas pass over your olfactory bulb  which transmits smell information from the nose to the brain  says company chief executive  eric fishman  an orthopedic surgeon  he prefers to call the product a    personal essential air diffuser    rather than a vaporizer  and says it provides similar benefits to strolling in a forest and inhaling the calming natural aromas  elixir vape llc  of long beach  calif   offers four liquids in its epothecary line      to     for a    milliliter bottle  with blends of flavors  such as cr  me caramel  and herbal extracts including well known substances widely used as oral dietary supplements  for example  awake is pitched as offering    natural energy  clear mind    and contains green tea  yerba mat   and ginseng  the liquids  which also contain a mix of vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol  can be used in any vaporizer with a refillable tank  says company co founder brendan kavanagh  vaporizers are hand held  battery powered devices  generally either cylindrical or rectangular in shape  so far there have been no reports of severe lung diseases caused by using vaporizers  but there is still    a great deal of uncertainty    about the long term risk  particularly of inhaling flavorings into the lungs  says  dr  jonathan m  samet  a professor in the department of preventive medicine at the university of southern california  several of the ingredients in the monq products have been shown  at least in preliminary studies  to have benefits as aromatherapy  lavender aromas were found in a study published earlier in september to help reduce anxiety in patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery  and the aroma of ylang ylang essential oil  contained in the company   s zen monq blend  was shown in a small      study to lower blood pressure and pulse  and improve feelings of alertness  a number of elixir vape   s products  such as green tea  have been mainly studied for use when ingested  mr  kavanagh says the herbal extracts  when inhaled  will travel to the lungs and enter the bloodstream through the alveoli components of both elixir and monq products also could potentially be absorbed through the skin of the nose and mouth  says candy tsourounis  a professor of clinical pharmacy at uscf   s school of pharmacy  but how much is absorbed depends on the size and other properties of the molecules  she says  that makes it impossible to assume that breathing the substances will yield the same benefits seen in studies on ingesting products  such as st  john   s wort  which has been shown effective for depression in some standardized preparations  dr  tsourounis says  although good quality organic botanicals may be safe to eat or take orally  it isn   t clear if they are safe when exposed to heat in a vaporizer and inhaled directly  particularly for long term use  dr  tsourounis says  monq heats liquids to     degrees celsius  elixir liquid temperatures will vary depending on the device used  after mixing with room temperature air  the mist hits the mouth at about room temperature  monq   s dr  fishman says another concern is that published studies  such as a report earlier this year in tobacco control  show teens who vape are statistically more likely to start smoking cigarettes   dr  richard miech  a professor at the university of michigan   s institute for social research in ann arbor  is studying whether vaping flavored liquids that don   t contain nicotine  which is popular among teens  is a bridge to smoking  monq and elixir vape say they try to discourage people under    from buying their products  monq   s purchase page has a check box that requires you to say you   re     elixir   s terms of service when buying say you must be     both companies say they plan to add further verification when i tried monq  i didn   t notice any effect on my mood  though i did enjoy using the product  hours of use resulted in irritation in the back of my throat  severe dry mouth and the runs   all of which are side effects occasionally seen in users  says dr  fishman  who keeps a list of side effects reported by customers on the company   s website  monq   s instructions recommend taking two or three puffs  two or three times a day   not using it continuously as i did  write to laura johannes at aches wsj com  corrections   amplifications    elixir vape   s co founder is brendan kavanagh  an earlier version of this article misspelled his last name
