original interview  http   www techiesproject com martha schumann okay  let   s start at the beginning  tell me a bit about your early years and where you come from i was born on an air force base in arkansas  but i grew up in huntsville  alabama  my dad was a pilot and my mom was a dietitian  i was a fairly nerdy and shy kid  i remember my first experience programming was in fourth grade         which is very unique  it was kind of amazing that my elementary school had a computer lab at all  i would hang out in there because it had a few fun video games  here   s looking at you  oregon trail   one time i figured out how to play the star wars main theme with ms dos  that was the first computer program i ever wrote  unfortunately  that was the only real computer program i wrote for about    years  in middle school i would tinker with geocities and angelfire for hours at night  but i had no idea that people could build websites for a living  i even took the first ever ap computer science class in my high school  where i ended up playing       more quake than learning any cs because the teacher didn   t know the material   even though i showed interest and had aptitude  i never really knew i could be a software engineer  it just wasn   t something that was on my radar i am curious to know what it was like being a creative  slightly nerdy kid in the south  as someone who was a creative kind of nerdy kid in the south i felt like a fish out of water  in some ways  that experience made me more creative  i would escape into painting  drawing  books or video games  i would day dream a lot i think that   s why i eventually decided to study graphic design and art history at auburn university  my grandmother was an artist and i was always involved with art  so i knew that i wanted to do something visual  but  i also knew i wanted to do something with computers  graphic design seemed like a natural choice it   s funny  as a kid my grandmother actually taught me how to use a computer  she had an ebay shop  her username was cellar  which is clever  where she sold antiques  and she would pay me by the hour to upload images with her ftp client and manage some of her listings  i didn   t realize at the time what a cool experience that was  i was a young woman  maybe    years old in alabama  being taught how to use a computer by her grandmother you studied design art history in academia  what was the impetus for being like     i   m going to learn to code now    it was out of necessity  i graduated in      which was the beginning of the recession  but we weren   t calling it that yet   i was completely broke and the only design jobs i could find involved some kind of web development  i had minimal programming experience in school  i had only done some actionscript  some flash  things like that  but nothing seriously so  i started taking jobs where html and css knowledge were required  then  one where i needed to learn jquery  then  one where i had to know some php  i would just study like crazy for interviews  and each time i would get a job that was a little more technical and was a little more programming focused eventually i wanted to double down and legitimize myself as a software engineer  i ended up moving to new york city to go to a programming school which is now called recurse center  i found the program by accident  i was just reading articles late at night and i saw a post saying etsy would sponsor women to go to this school  so  i applied  and  i actually lied to get in  i told them i had javascript experience but i didn   t  i knew the entrance exam would involve writing a fizz buzz application  so i just memorized it so i could write it in the interview  i knew if i could just get in i would figure it all out  and thankfully i was right so you were in new york  what eventually transitioned you to silicon valley i accepted a job from etsy  in new york  out of recurse center  it was my first real software engineering job  and at the time it was my dream job  unfortunately it was a rough transition  at that point  i had   months of coding experience and was working in a team that well   just wasn   t working  i was in a tough situation and things were not working out with my manager and it crushed me yeah  that   s literally enough for you to never go back into development again yeah  i almost didn   t eventually i just kind of washed my hands of it and moved on  deep down i knew that he was wrong  and  i knew i really wanted this  i   m so thankful i realized that so  i ended up moving to san francisco and joining uber  that decision changed my life  i   ve found a team where i   m a good fit  and i   ve been kicking ass  i was promoted last year  and i   m hopeful it could happen again this year that   s so great  tell me a bit about what elements of your work really excite you and what really activates you in your work i really love what i do  so  i happen to be on a platform team at uber  that means my customers are my peers  other engineers at the company  it   s incredibly validating and exciting for me when they enjoy using the tools i   ve built to help them do their job  i also just really like writing scripts and building applications and watching them work  i feel like a wizard  sometimes  especially when i can help someone debug a random issue they   re having  software is a really fun field because you can constantly learn something new and improve yourself  i like that i   m opinionated about certain technical decisions because i have experience that formed those opinions  i   m also proud that i   m known for a high bar of code quality  just seeing myself improve really activates me what else have been some of your biggest roadblocks and struggles  and just hardships you   ve had to overcome there were  and are  struggles  it   s hard for people to assume you   re not very technical  or that you   re not an engineer at all  or  to be the only woman engineer on a team  or in a company   before i went to nyc  i was working at a company where i was the only woman on the engineering team out of around    people  and i remember  we had this communal chat room where we all would just chat all day long  one day someone posted some pornographic images in chat  and i remember saying     this is inappropriate  don   t post that in work chat     they told me to stop being a girl about it  i remember  they had no hr  it was like a startup at that point  so i just had to deal with it  another time we had a meeting to talk about our benefits  and there was no mention of maternity leave  i just remember raising my hand and asking     is that something that you offer     they said     no  we   ve never had to offer it before     those two events really made me think about what i was doing  or the kind of environment that i was in in silicon valley you hear the word    meritocracy    thrown around a lot  i don   t believe tech is a meritocracy  laughter i also think women   s contributions aren   t recognized as often as their male peers  i think we   re underpaid  i   m reminded of a quote in ender   s game  as a woman you really have to be    so good at what you do that they can   t ignore you     struggling against these things has made me work harder and become a better person and a stronger engineer  but it   s frustrating as hell  i honestly believe if you are a minority in tech  you are probably extraordinarily good at your job  you really have to be  to overcome people   s misconceptions about you in your pre interview  you mentioned the challenge of surviving tech culture without losing yourself  tell me about that absolutely  i have this conversation with a lot of young engineers  it   s  understandably  easy to want to assimilate yourself into techbro culture  early in my career i would wear the hoodie  laugh at the inappropriate jokes  and water down my femininity so i would be taken seriously  i don   t do that anymore  i finally realized if i don   t bring my full self with me to work i   m not doing myself or anyone else any favors  i think it does everyone some good to see engineers around the office that don   t fit the stereotypes based on your life experience  what advice would you give to folks from similar backgrounds to you in tech be good at teaching yourself  be self motivated  be okay with failure and days lost to an errant comma  learn the vocabulary  be precise when you say something  don   t struggle alone with a problem for too long  learn to ask questions effectively so people can help you quickly  always read error messages thoroughly  every bug or mistake is a learning opportunity know that this is worth fighting for  i hope you can find the strength within yourself to keep going when people tell you that you can   t do something  they don   t determine whether you can or can   t do something  you do words from a techie turned
