articles sharapova receives two year ban from tennis           when maria sharapova announced earlier this year that she had tested positive for a banned substance at the australian open  she said she was unaware that the drug was prohibited from competition  a tribunal agreed with her on wednesday and handed her a reduced suspension of two years  but stung sharapova anew by concluding that she took the drug to enhance her performance  not just for long standing medical issues sharapova  the winner of five grand slam singles titles and a former no    ranked player  tested positive for meldonium on jan      the latvian made cardiac drug has triggered     positive tests among athletes this year  as of june    the drug was banned by the world anti doping agency as of jan    an international tennis federation tribunal on wednesday banned the    year old sharapova for two years  rather than four  after finding that her conduct was not intentional but the ruling took a harsh view of sharapova   s claim that she had taken mildronate  a brand name for meldonium  for    years because of various health concerns  including low magnesium  irregular electrocardiogram results and a family history of diabetes    it may be that she genuinely believed that mildronate had some general beneficial effect on her health but the manner in which the medication was taken  its concealment from the anti doping authorities  her failure to disclose it even to her own team  and the lack of any medical justification must inevitably lead to the conclusion that she took mildronate for the purpose of enhancing her performance     the tribunal concluded sharapova   s attorney  john haggerty  said the tribunal   s findings on performance enhancing were    flat out wrong    and contradicted by their own determination that sharapova did not intentionally violate anti doping rules and merited a reduced suspension    if she had performance enhanced  she would have received a sentence of four years   the rules couldn   t be clearer     haggerty said     it makes no sense    sharapova  who testified before the tribunal  said in a statement that she would appeal the ruling to the court of arbitration for sport  an independent authority based in switzerland that considers sports related disputes     i cannot accept an unfairly harsh two year suspension     said sharapova     the tribunal  whose members were selected by the itf  agreed that i did not do anything intentionally wrong    the performance enhancing benefits of meldonium are not clear  wada banned the drug after finding evidence that athletes were using it to boost performance  but one recent paper published by the american college of clinical pharmacology questioned whether the drug had any medical benefits at all although the tribunal   s findings could further damage sharapova   s reputation and numerous sponsorship deals  she received some positive news from longtime partner nike on wednesday  the company had suspended its contract with sharapova in march  pending the results of her hearing  it lifted that suspension on wednesday  noting that the tribunal had found that sharapova did not intentionally break anti doping rules    maria has always made her position clear  has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban     the nike statement said     we hope to see maria back on court and will continue to partner with her    the tribunal described sharapova   s use of meldonium as    systematic     including before each of her five matches at this year   s australian open  and at wimbledon and other events last year the tribunal said that sharapova took as many as    medications when under the care of her former physician  dr  anatoly skalny  when she ended her relationship with him in       she only continued to take three of them  including mildronate she said she only told her longtime agent  max eisenbud of img  and one other physician  dr  sergei yasnitsky  of the russian olympic team  that she was taking the drug  she did not tell her nutritionist  coach or physiotherapist    the tribunal finds it hard to credit that no medical practitioner whom she consulted over a period of three years  with the exception of dr  yasnitsky  would  in accordance with standard medical practice  have asked her what medications she was taking     the ruling said haggerty said the tribunal had ignored evidence that sharapova continued to take meldonium because tests on her heart showed it was medically necessary    her doctor said you have medical conditions that are impairing your heart  so when you are going to exert yourself  you need to take this medication to protect your heart  plain and simple     haggerty said     in no way is it aimed toward boosting or enhancing her performance  it   s the complete contrary    the tribunal also took a skeptical view of sharapova   s failure to declare the drug on any anti doping forms  which are given to players before drug tests  between      and       those forms ask athletes to declare any substances taken over the past seven days     this was a deliberate decision  not a mistake     the tribunal said haggerty said sharapova routinely interpreted anti doping declarations to mean any substances she had taken on a daily basis for seven days  he added that sharapova   s status as a worldwide star did her no favors     i think that the tribunal here was looking to make an example out of maria because she is such a high profile  world recognized athlete     haggerty said the panel also dismissed sharapova   s arguments that the itf  which notifies players and their agents about changes to anti doping rules via email  had not done enough to warn her of the upcoming ban sharapova will lose prize money and ranking points from the australian open  if the two year ban stands  she would miss eight grand slam singles tournaments and could not compete again until late january       when she will two months from her   st birthday haggerty argued for a lesser sentence because of sharapova   s longstanding compliance with anti doping laws and her reputation  but the tribunal said the anti doping rules must apply equally to all players    if  sharapova  had not concealed her use of mildronate from the anti doping authorities  members of her own support team and the doctors whom she consulted  but had sought advice  then the contravention would have been avoided     the tribunal said     she is the sole author of her own misfortune
