articles childhood cancer research looks at genetic origins           when noah arnold developed tumors on his kidney around his first birthday  doctors at st  jude children   s research hospital in memphis removed them and diagnosed them as benign  despite that good news  a strong history of thyroid problems in noah   s father   s family aroused his doctors    suspicions  noah   s parents gave the go ahead for a genetic test that showed the boy had a mutation in a gene called dicer   which is associated with a heightened risk of thyroid and other cancers  noah   s older sister  sarah anne  now   years old  was found to have the mutation  too  now she and her brother  who turns   in december  undergo regular ultrasound screening and other tests to check for early tumor formation on their kidneys and other organs     he   s   year old and you   re telling me he   s got two large tumors in his kidney  i needed to know why     the children   s mother  dorothy arnold  of lexington  s c   recalls thinking     my job is to be aware and keep up with everything so if anything happens we can stay on top of it and catch it early    the arnold children may never develop cancer  but with some tumors associated with a dicer  mutation  says  emily quinn  the genetics counselor on their case at st  jude     if we catch it early  the kids have much better outcomes than if we catch it later     noah and sarah anne are among    children from    families currently being treated at st  jude   s recently established cancer predisposition clinic  one of a number of new centers charting new territory in managing cases of hereditary pediatric cancers  recent studies show about     of childhood cancers may be inherited looking for a genetic link to pediatric cancers reflects expanding efforts to match adult and child patients with drugs that target specific mutations found to drive growth of their tumors  by analyzing dna not only from a diagnosed child   s tumor cells but also normal dna from blood or skin tissue from the child and other family members  doctors can determine whether the cancer is likely to be unique to the child  or if a potentially cancer causing mutation is lurking in the family the results can influence treatment and indicate whether children might be at risk for other tumors later in life  or pass on risk to future children of their own  says  kim nichols  a pediatric oncologist who heads st  jude   s cancer predisposition clinic in memphis  tenn  if the cancer arose from a parent  it    has implications that extend well beyond that child and touches upon relatives     she says family members who are found to have a hereditary mutation increasing their risk of developing cancer get regular checkups  with the aim of detecting disease early     the assumption is it would improve survival     says  john m  maris  a pediatric oncologist at children   s hospital of philadelphia  which also has a cancer predisposition program about        to        children a year are diagnosed with cancer in the u s   making up about    of all cancers  research over the past few decades has made great strides  about     of children are cured of their disease  though aggressive treatments can have long lasting side effects and the children can be at risk for future tumors  the remaining     have proved resistant to effective treatment strategies researchers have only recently begun to find answers to the question haunting parents  why do children get cancer to begin with genomic studies are providing some insight  a study of       cancer patients under age     published in the new england journal of medicine last fall by st  jude researchers  found that so called autosomal dominant mutations   those in which a child has a       chance of inheriting from a parent   accounted for      of tumors  the report is part of the pediatric cancer genome project  which st  jude is leading with washington university in st  louis  with funding from st  jude and the national cancer institute  in january  researchers at texas children   s hospital and baylor college of medicine  both in houston  published data from a     patient study called basic   which found  among other results  that about     patients had hereditary mutations  the federally funded basic  study addressed a common concern among doctors   that parents would be leery of genetic information about their children and struggle to understand the implications  instead  the study found    parents are highly motivated to get any information that might be relevant to the care of their child     says  will parsons  a pediatric oncologist and co leader of the basic  study with cancer geneticist  sharon plon not every hereditary mutation in children comes from their parents  researchers have learned cancer predisposing mutations can emerge in sperm cells or eggs  some may not be present in the parents    dna  in february       bella kate pickens  then    months old  had a ct scan to check for a concussion after she fell and bumped her head  it revealed she had a brain tumor  it was an astrocytoma  which doesn   t typically spread from its site of origin  it was removed during a    hour operation at st  jude her mother  amanda pickens of meridianville  ala   says bella kate was born with a congenital heart defect and had physical features consistent with a genetic syndrome  a test turned up a mutation in a gene called sos   which in about    of cases is associated with a brain tumor mrs  pickens says the next question was whether her other daughter was at risk  too  mrs  pickens and her husband were tested first and found not to have the sos  mutation     it was not hereditary     she says     we decided not to test our daughter    some mutations lead to cancer nearly      of the time  but for others it may be only a     or     chance  says dr  maris  of children   s hospital of philadelphia     it   s a significant risk  but it skips a generation or two  these are the factors we have to grapple with as we come up with recommendations for how to use this information to benefit patients    oncologists also must keep up with the sheer number of genetic syndromes that increase a person   s risk of cancer  which currently number about      dr  nichols  of st  jude  says     knowledge is evolving daily     she says     the idea is to be able to translate what we   re learning from these genetic studies to the clinical realm     write to ron winslow at ron winslow wsj com
