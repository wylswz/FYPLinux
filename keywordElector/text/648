deceased     we invited industry expats on a kenyan from ccs insight     as howard profits from hp     said on and what all the security challenge he s in for instance     thanks to all     that s happened is a technology used in the enterprise driven     now it s intense look by     its human devices and bring you into the streets moves     from the enterprise     into the consumer stakes which means that it s become a nut them     easier     and more attractive for indy the tools to steal date to     access state out     and attack devices that on the controlled those devices the smartphone and that and that s     how they tap which is     cinema and sold on all of these devices     at the same time     that is good very little protection against malware     and viruses     at the same time that day to seats in the cloud     where it s not necessary encrypted milk well protected     use this tend to have     simple passwords     that the eurozone all the devices of the same time on all of their different accounts     they also as they travel     you connect to any access points which male main rbc killed     and the date that can be send completely through the airwaves an encrypted     the toes     as     human beings ease of use the security every time we will do whatever it is the simplest     to do     so     education     is     something that governments are trying to push     to make shore that end users when they are in the and myspace are aware     of all the security challenges     one of the problems of businesses is that national governments have defended conditions on once     the crime cyber attack the virus attack and whether levels of protection businesses should adopt     these government it s different     and there isn t a generics under the finishing up what companies should do     so the end of the day it s very difficult especially for the small and medium businesses     to focus on security even if the house to     because of the coal priorities that they have in their business     how it     was a hold on to secure it     all     i can say is one of the largest oxy solution providers and wealth     and that     is a leader in the industry for ice price ninety security     i     hp was written on it and     dwell largest banks and wealth     at ten am to ten of the largest telecoms companies and     oldest major branches of the u s comps defense     that of a five thousand professionals in unsecured to practice across the wealth in the     eights at the security senses across the globe     and as a leader in them and in crane s     princes of her large pots about the security products     i m     in the print industry we are the only a vendor with that with a nazi back and     say no when it comes to making it easy store     contracts is so awful     copy of a copy of the kind     where were nazis and     nestle secured say     is that designed eighty thousand in school caught up     to snuff just listen up     um     so as well as     a unique solutions like an engine increasing security center     we make sure the temperance is integrated with that and prices security platforms such as an hp oxides     so that so     we retreated trends in the same iso the devices on the network it s not just on the loan that stands alone in church     it s interesting     that     what s the chances of enterprising countering     antti security     when will the short answer     would be very high     should a recent study     that shows up of about two hundred and thirty     and companies worldwide     shows that there s been an increase in successful attacks     from last year     we have     on average     a hundred and twenty two successful attacks the co week     and that s very upset is there an eighteen percent increase from now see a     significant any means that     each company has experienced two successful attacks per week     it s enough to do a lot of damage and they the the interesting thing from that survey is that     on average fifty six percent of the anisa moulton howe     has bein     the teams of attack     but youtube them     up to two hundred and forty three days     to realize that they have been be teamed up and attacked     sometime between the did     the damage and     taking steps to is all it     is moment of korea     i like it when it came karol specific secure species     what are the requirements     is there anything that can be potentially next     on the right and and i t department traditionally     they both spent thousands enforcing security on the xe devices so this go     so     this then came the first draft of some of my devices so the doctor ups     it didn t already know the phone s goes it was that when connected tool     nowadays with the small spoons those     habits and habits and to bring you one devices     companies have to start to have to think about its     we see something new one devices     once the iq department takes all these books is they can get them done and then forget about     it is     an okie function devices     conditioning     i m     when the cool thing as a ninety developments     they buy into smoky function devices and they do to get a disease that when they don t have one to vote by facilities management     all it s a small business may just connect them with standard settings     the risks are with these devices that don t think of his first began seq     any employee with any     device that the house but small device can connect to them     and use them in anywhere they want but also     they can     be these devices on its a killer they can scan any dutchman     send them all but know that     and be the new devices have the latest technologies which means that they re connected to the internet     to domestic u s a potential     full     access through the internet bills to have     usb     keys which can code viruses all sorts of nowhere that     shouldn t be that     so yes     princess multi function devices     need to be added     to the east of     the     devices in a secure cheap and see how the lack of a comprehensive network security policy     affected     learn     seems implications of that lacks in commencement policy     and     the risks its     devices and software     remained     on patch     nestle the vulnerable to an intrusion from     xm honestly internal     threats     service the organizations the and social prophecy     that they said     and also baffled that they choose their customers so that clients or     patients for example     um um um oh conceal my ization su     the liabilities if that no complaint with the     regulations and legislation requiring them to secure than a mandate     um     just     the tonic i strive     when you consider that a cause us to use to communicate     been been steadily and accidentally     organizations to consider the implications of how well they manage their documents     and the     are a free sample of confidential documents left on top of the prince s     or a fax machines     um     can documents the copay jewel box to post and even without any audit trail of use     this comes which document     so is also advisable to make sure that the security policy     considers both on electronic     and paper documents     i was a specific quality imaging and printing     are there any sekedar risks     yes there is so i ll be deemed to have to pay the state to active because     it s     it s a hopeful ducking     and     it s     one of the most difficult     process ization want to two peaks because it comes down to the culture     of the use this     and then divvy anticipate it is fantastic because it slide     it s easy to trends bolton carry unfolding can take it with you     the costs for gold timing never runs out the best rink     you can brighten it you can make a notation it s really a good     medium for communication and co work     however because it s easy     since posted everywhere it s also cool looking     pretty much everywhere and because it s like you will really miss it and feel that to me seen any paper that meant     so     in its lex beelining taxis to be transposed or     in places where it shouldn t     and it s it s not a surprise that most of the finds that to you the information     commissioner s a face in the uk has levied against     companies is one to commence in paper     that wasn t secured a tool     and because we re still in a hybrid world weigh     paper and an introduction and it can be     had this thought process an application form for mortgage     or any of the type of return but you can in and submit     or at the end the output ripoll enable us to     approach this opel as confidential conclusion of an analysis     so ideally full businesses they need to     be a     determined but he sees that will ensure that     only the right people access to the right day to     underwrite switching devices at the right time     and that did the right direction and     he s used     by these people know that any document     at anytime     and anywhere so it s too awesome makes the combination of     hardware devices putting seeds     and determined that exceeds the speed and to     i     e mail incremental costs for i     mean how much the securitizations cost     the days     and the costs of     breach and noncompliance     on me with that with a base case and this this is a variety of costs to consider     the first one is the cost to the business so we re thinking about ghosts of business when     and assistance of don t     fit so i keep thirteen     loss of custom estate up so that a survey that was done recently     finds that     the average cost to business when that happens these eleven point six million dollars     so it s not in significant     and that varies from one point three     to     collect sixty million     can     last year that was beyond nine median on average the we ve done jumped from be going on     two     almost twelve billion so it s up     to twenty five percent increase he notes     the small amount of money and that s the first aren t disgusted goes to the business the second     is rippey station costs     and that s very very difficult to access a six     year old time to measure the impact of these     small and medium businesses asics are extremely vulnerable two days depending on the industry that in     time for     this small business that can     really     npd mean that they knew was that customer base from one day     to the next     you see there s some     pretty cool square sensitivity of information     would be critical if it was called a mine supply     banks and financial institutions but     because of the nature of the risk we don t know about it it may happen     but it s not to be disclosed however it s it s     humid and the final one     is bigotry risk and preaches so in the uk     that can cost up to four to two million pounds each time     so and     so what shp advice to     attend a pre teen     we take a     full house approached us     um     this thing is the need to do is to protect the     wet     on the main says physically so making shows that that that that     this is a lot of sense it s um we don t people stealing bits of the devices     um and also um     he was made to local law so we know that that said people consume woke up and connects us people s go one people to do that some of those down as well     so for reasons other than switch recall from my pickles may show but that definitely comes from hk so once downloaded to my shirt signed by each case matures genuine isn t anyone actually trying to catch a break from it     i need to control access to the device itself so without so over the networking company chill u s chains that people pass was uncertain passwords     on the second one man show that sent     the actual people are actually authorized use machines that means woodson on pants     so instead how well you don t have to     protect the data that goes into one from a chain and that means again authenticating users  passwords and pains     um     q what about some people capturing the password so credentials the choices to pick a solution that using a trusted platform module mental is a skillet     i think it was to and from a machine so     if you can use encryption of weather sets in at what level or actually increase from a drive of the force she sends it to the printer     and ends jobs and documents can also be stored on the multifunction nazis     so that means that if qantas consumption shane and it could be renewed at some point you need to encrypt about this tonight show that said if it still in the tech to come to use     um and you can also make shore that said it s the one those jobs to be silly to continue can and delinquency kill mike using debt using special tools     much of a securely erase     um and also because we can stand says things like in iowa remote destinations     um we need to make shore that said i cannot condone skill its efforts on making sure the email was sent to kill him encrypted emails     finally as i mentioned that to these devices are now often connected to a     remote     storage example in the class for example she s may show that sarah     comes and it s going to and from the cloud is that his     access securely     on and printed on newsprint from client process insecurely     so it protected the web     with protective effects     the next thing you need to do is the type of documents     mrs wet we a     we look at some     of the paper itself so     the most secure documents     to the one you don t trends     and i m     the next bus to kill is one such a crazy when the user isn t she stunning of the device of a decent pot     and this is the notion that which copel print which is ukraine from     what sebi also says     that sits in a basic rights and another device you pull it from the bags of ice     on it comes the new complex to play     i m so tickled rental securely smith device itself     um     mo while printing is a is a very important to this and have to make shows again those tunnels increasing the concepts of tablets are actually skillet     and a critique     station is incl pizza for something station is by labels such is the     but it s a     check so prescriptions all the heading of equity organization     you can make show that they had traced the input race to me because     likeable     um     finally the book means itself     you can i show the book itself come the time with sadie no actually     working     so we can set to top last     week a tactic that rates     would take to the documents     on to them i was the final khan says you estimates it mom to manage everything that s going on in these key consultant     so it s us execution risks not just pass the problems but what might come as a future     and adjust your policy based on not     i m unique to     set yourself nicely by its     policy     and a     and     and and push stocks across the whole the network     i might continue monitoring devices for any kind of risks to which missions on maintaining     compliance that the regulations say that     so can i say she s fine in commencing in imaging and printing security strategy challenging     how this hp approach that the cost     one criticism of systems advances do need to be included in the overall oxy secures posts     alongside the servers desktops and mobile devices them     most     on specials them to think about the thing and just prince s over the just copy is     on an all     the last fifteen years so these things been running     so this is actually on the onthe net worth or what service and ftp servers telmex that this is such a run on these devices and amal mums are running     applications and     web services     um     so for example if the the company policy monday s there it s the the use of a trusty puzzle module on that service on lots of example     then you need to make sure the prince s multifunction trustees also comply with the pulsing     um     it s like a ghost is included     hundreds of patients though i ll customers to ensure the devices comply with whatever requirements     hundreds of faces sounds complicated but that     has not been easy lacks the flexibility to actually make sure you comply with new policy     luv is a suite of tools the streets of the tools the jets     offense which which allows you to manage those same policies in the second small particular points     and configure and an implement the policy right across the whole fleets     and then once the policies incumbency due to get customers the capability to fill the seat if any devices are no complaints or reports in some kind of     anomalous behavior     oh i was the administrative sue     investigation address whatever obstacles that     some of     the hardware and software are any parts of the story in any strategy to apply security policy     so how does hp eight times ones that want to control it     okay so     most of them to go uni tools     to achieve that s the foundation and security     to the imaging and printing security center     we also offer     an advisor sets its brand and security     aam     boyfriend is the one of the     key reasons the clients haven t sentiment so this is     a frenzy scarcer policy     as the sole lack of resources that second goal of the soul sees also     like expertise specifically ramp and security     so     we of a class today was to work with that security consultants     with a specific pre security background so that     free security can be included in that time and that policy     and erm     consultants and customer will review the current     security state through a     very robust risk analysis using the tools in the jets  offensive sweet     alongside al consultants for a detailed knowledge of trends and secures an experience of the subject     and together build is on a planet that and and implement some posts a     summation of the interest of complaints     so the clans can well with the leader in ninety secures a     constant intrinsic years in a     sense of time     many customers olson s without compromising their overall secure its effectiveness     i m watching organizations cheese hp     okay well     as well as the     one other world leaders in an icy security hp is a global leader     in a managed print services     and guess is that you can use music     so i just the most complex organization     in the wealth     trust hk     to my spectron s environments on ally nostra due setup man costs improve     effectiveness tokenization     so     ensuring that business critical piece of the art infrastructure is to kill     as we really call it an excuse hp because they agree that we ve got the industry s most     complete and benefits if i m     solution profile     i m     on is in some about we develops a solution that     would call the imaging and printing security sensor i m     thousand units of to a opinion a supreme providers and     some customers about two days with a space     specifically because wheel for these pieces of software and solutions     what amazes we can define the employee id and security policy across the entire plate of hundreds thousands of devices     um we can sense when an unsecured devices to brussels than welcome within seconds we can deploy the policies that says nominates him annually on those devices     um     really really useful new feature a case of the cyclical certificate management wet     certificates identifies itself is a genuinely belonging to hp us the overnight session     now previously     the sessions cuts among you lay     out those is that they can somehow from science may show they were the show does anyone if you have thousands of devices we have a policy that meant no certificates will have to be affected every month     some form and that s how to do that every single one of my new light     now we have the ability to actually do the most amount eclat imaging and printing securities and to     see them as safe as houses bounce wants to save it     again and again and again     said some organizations have chosen specifically because of that     innovation around a     solution     one of the megatrends that is affecting societies the grace of my pissy     how would secure its effective by the increase in the use of mobile devices     so by by twenty fifty will be about seventy billion     connected devices will want a huge     number     and that s koum     and business everywhere     the moments we say that about sixty percent of the us the predation owns a smartphone already     and the generation y it s and higher seventy two percent     oe     in donor countries the smartphone     app     in its you put all that data together eighty seven percent of the world appreciation     is connected     at its     massive number and it s it s increasing     so the disco had been replaced by the notebooks     and that that that song peaking in the small school and     that it sometime yet mobileye     and     the game stations and the rest so all of these means an absolute explosion at the same time we see     that from this case studies that productivity     of the move by worker is a twenty percent higher     than     workers in your face of estimates and to     pool continues     to     enable that stuff to work anywhere anytime with the right to direct devices     euro the mba s survey tells us that about forty percent of     companies and use your aam denning still to invest     in the mix and snow cone     the risk with these that they can just the security risks     so a photo of     the year companies in europe are also planning to invest on     mobileye device management so all     the money train tracking     of these devices     and if if so that s a bit disappointing but the fifth of companies are also investing     on the bed devices securities so that i will tend to rise from the us     so for these put together     means that bike twenty fourteen about eighty percent of the world want the commission     would also need in cities     we have the technological trend you have     the demographics     and it s also     push by the fact that people are spending     more time commuting     so     christine     kullman a simple businesses will buy us because we don t have to waste time     getting from a to b     all more productive hence this twenty percent     we found     and the technology has it holds     that to the point now     that it s     it s true winding the volume of sprint     until recently     we know that     people like to print and when they want to access based on information     that still piece of paper     to work on it and another a toll however them ovide devices     when the sex in a way that you could easy to just last month or find a printer on the tea function devices     and printers     it wasn t easy     so we re lazy we didn t do it     nowadays it s embedded in the operating system it s in the devices     it s very easy to cream from a mobile device to     multi function device     or a printer     so we do and we seen an increase in the volume of pages     and is printed from     these devices to     disconnected infrastructure which means that any     it s um     it s the race     it s as secure a tea house and it s something that needs to be     monitored and controlled     we find that more than half of the move i won t scream from     them ovide devices     so far from being insignificant     what     that means tasteful businesses they most need to     think of the business process is     i m looking out     for the technologies     including three new in devices including mobile devices and so the green engine in     the business process increasing security in     how would     the company simple he still chris acuity for medical devices for naps ipo     us the same place amongst us a sense of the office its consent of the network     i m     content immobile and considered wise     the thing is when when when when     on him     mention the actual spin directly from from the nazis     set example when things was actually the biggest complaints about the region on funds the complaint from it so apple builds idea     and     ten articles that trends which the machines are not compatible with so from     i went said     devices apple device you catch it and it isn t     i m going with cups of multiple my sick and that hp is up to one of the founder members this michael comeau peril and switch to let hundred devices to print     just as easily from one cents     um     i mean one thing about     the fed prints and i m altria     technologies is that you re actually able to friends     directly to     the device by wireless without actually touching the organizational network     which means most to kill     um     and     that connection is to some of semicon sorceress of the networking you can can connect to driven by wireless     up     more amazes ullal     and for some customers in a branch all around you     visits to steal off thanks to a lamp     the prince to     conceal devices     without ever having to allow them access to network     the second method which is of small specific to employees is a using the     benefits of solution and isabelle which is called the aprons and surprise     what does is allow     registered users     to print documents to     the present in savills station     um when the devices are on the outside the that the network for example neither they using     three g awful geo something on the phones with any friends     rather than having to connect via wireless to them what they can to print it     that that the aprons in surprise     and server allows them to those jobs be sent to them and sends them to the princess     it s amazing you can see trains     us to from anywhere in the well     to any other     device on the comfy network     anywhere else in the wealth     now offices and generally just going to the one next to them     um     combine that with the technology i mentioned which is apple prints and to keep the use of nfc and concepts such as the prince and release the job using the phone the box that printed from     my financial and security     i m on the final thing that city cousins prices causes the xilai you to use what s called a public prince locations so not just devices that are inside the network but if your on the road and unique supreme example avoiding condo units of princess uncommon to confront customer     um     you know how to how something called a public prints     and location which monday public print location of what he sat and sun something wet     i m     six of the hotel business and said it will make the coffee shop or something like that she ll analysts said that that that clients to actually use the prince s in that devices so     using them     the     location using the tumble j location so we know whale phone is confined to the nearest public prints it is     a new concrete so it s     an awesome that i was back to your device he can release it to define sue     us it s a pretty soon     ay ay ay device inside to come to network or if you need one close by     they intensifies will find you the nearest one new conferences and what social from that     so     all about the secured and so and so were able to     allow people from an ounce on the network supreme to our company organizations that sees     all our employees to prints of devices from nus     are equally     at supreme to nus     and within the public rings     that s impressive     adam     button until it hp devices contain any special features to and i got to and fro if and when preaching sensitive documents     yes that s and that s a very cold possible thin securities     so we we do have the millet seed to let security light as     as a printed documents     for example low weakness michael the micra printing which with     metal thanks to sites that can change that adopting new princess example a time mandates     all     mega serial number the device so are they the user name something out of the micro printing across its     business if it was someone     reading the documents what you re able to know     you is pre pubescent about the command what s conferences     and larry was conceived     um we can also artwalks amounts to the frontal career if the output     the takeaway we can also add maths the document so that when it s actually a capito facts that comes up to show the dissension kapil facts so you know the unknown looking in the     original documents but what about san critical documents such as prescriptions     i can hp princes gardens ten     well yes we have a cost we have the option for customers to use the time to time     in taiwan a self hazem     um it is     is     has a large constituency that is all of this type of sticks     on what happens is when i go to the prince has melted and it sticks to the page     so in the class that in its hands made using them     using chemicals o sullivan stocks with his old for such accretion on this and then fall off and ended up with such a put back super into which     differ value in that example someone changing the value of a check on a contract or something     um so using tamper proof style into     um     if that s the somewhat hostile to the upcoming clay     bennett what happens is the a total of two releases compound which blitzed on that changes the color of it so was quite mass becomes a blue or     red smear across the documents     when does it shows that sometimes be made to all
