articles downplayed abbey the makeover of a mansion              it seemed like something out of a fairy tale     said new york designer carl d   aquino  summing up his clients    reaction to the jacobean revival home they found in the gated enclave of tuxedo park  n y  the manhattan couple sought a weekend escape that would capably accommodate their five children  extended family and guests  they discovered it    miles north of gotham  in an        square foot manse built in       amid postcard ready vistas of tuxedo lake and the nearby ramapo mountains  the home is one of     mansions of varying architectural styles   from greek revival to italianate   whose original owners unironically referred to them as cottages  though the homeowners loved the house for its size and the light  it posed a challenge  how to make its palatial rooms  with their interior columns and archways  feel less pretentious and more welcoming to a young  unceremonious family    tuxedo park is very formal and grand     said mr  d   aquino  who with his partner francine monaco was entrusted with restoring and decorating the home  indeed  the black tie attire we now call a tuxedo reportedly got its name when it was popularized by the village   s social set   including j p  morgan and emily post   after one of the group visited the prince of wales in       the future edward vii favored the short jacketed alternative to tails    for dinner in the country     overcoming the home   s dapper ghosts was among mr  d   aquino   s goals  he said     we needed to make it more comfortable  because this family wasn   t going to live in that manner  this house needed to relax    to offset the strong  somewhat foreboding architecture  the designers chose a paint palette of pale colors  further softness came from well stuffed and inviting custom upholstered furnishings as well as personal touches  the couple has a penchant for pieces from asia  where the family spent years   such as the chinese cinnabar lacquered barrel stools in the living room  and the children   s hands are seen everywhere  from a gallery of their paintings to palm print fireplace tiles     they are so proud and delighted     said mr  d   aquino of the contributing kids  when the clients  a couple with five kids  asked new york design firm d   aquino monaco to transform the fusty  rosewood paneled library of their jacobean revival house in tuxedo park  n y   into a family room  the designers were initially stumped  but the parents had saved hundreds of their children   s art works     we saw this box of beautiful  naive paintings and said     that   s it  we   re done        said  carl aquino  uniformly framed in gold wood  the art informed the colors of the custom seating and hexagonal spiral wool rug  the circa      bronze chandeliers and a    foot  button tufted edwardian couch upholstered in a flame stitch fabric are a nod to the period of the house     we had enough playfulness with the children   s art  the rug  modern fabrics and oversize pieces    when imagining a children   s playroom  you don   t usually think exposed fieldstone and tudor arched windows  so the designers lightened the heavy mood in what mr  d   aquino thinks was originally a sleeping porch by incorporating tiles imprinted with the kids    hands into the fireplace mantel  a cement topped round table from perry luxe surrounded by portable kartell plastic stools caters to the children  other pieces  such as a possibly original metal ceiling lantern and the wingback chair  reference the home   s vintage  but upholstery remains unadorned and the lantern  as well as the wall sconces  were punched up with a cobalt blue lacquer to keep the overall feeling contemporary the     square foot living room boasted    foot ceilings  crown moldings and verde marble columns and pilasters that house folklore says were salvaged from a manhattan bank  d   aquino monaco applied the pastel palette they were using throughout the house in a random repeat of vertical stripes to cover walls  wainscoting  dentil moldings and door trim  successfully playing down the room   s patrician hauteur  double tiered murano glass chandeliers by venini concede to the period  and scale  of the house  as do the classic seating shapes and the lee jofa crewelwork sofa fabric the fieldstone clad house  with limestone window and door surrounds and large slate gables  sits atop a heavily forested hill on    acres that overlook tuxedo and we wah lakes     these homes were built for formal entertaining  with grand rooms and classical layouts     said mr  d   aquino  he and his design partner responded to the rooms    vastness by creating oversize furnishings that  though largely traditional  come off modern by virtue of unpatterned  casual upholstery  similarly  throughout the house  simple  white linen roman shades update windows that historically might have been shrouded in brocades layered with tassels  trims and tiebacks  the homeowners asked that the    bedrooms be casual and inviting  blue  ivory and white dominate the restful color palette of the linens  and fluffy down comforters  rather than tailored spreads  clothe the beds  white linen shades maximize sunlight and minimize fussiness  strong believers in the coziness of cushioning  note the tufted bench and armchair   the designers created upholstered headboards for each boudoir  but none of the other rooms    headboards sport fabric quite as ornate as this master suite   s silk velvet  which is patterned with a goldtone vine  apparently parenthood has its privileges
