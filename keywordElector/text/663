articles mascots are getting a hall of fame and its making benny the bull emotional             robert boudwin keeps a gold plated trophy of a silly string can in the foyer of his suburban houston home so it   s the first thing visitors see when they arrive the memento signifies what the    year old says is his defining career achievement  election into the hall of fame  for mascots    it makes me feel like a big deal     says mr  boudwin  who retired this summer after    years performing as clutch the bear at houston rockets basketball games soon mr  boudwin will have company  as what he calls the    furternity    of mascots prepares to announce its first new slate of candidates for the hall of fame in almost a decade  the ballot will coincide with another milestone   the groundbreaking for a bricks and mortar location in whiting  ind   for the hall  which until now has only existed as an online tribute to plush stadium stalwarts such as the famous chicken  phillie phanatic and mr  met  mascots  who regularly bash each other in full costume fisticuffs and sometimes literally jump through flaming hoops as part of a night   s work  are now getting their shot at immortality if that seems frivolous  don   t tell it to whiting mayor  joseph stahura  who acknowledges hearing from local residents who consider it    a totally stupid idea    yet mr  stahura championed the project and pushed through a     million tax increment financing package to fund it  part of a plan to boost tourism in the town of       on the shores of lake michigan  he believes the project will help the town become known for more than its annual pierogi festival and the distinctive odors from the largest oil refinery in the midwest  where mr  stahura worked for    years the        square foot building  expected to open next year  will feature a collage of oversize mascot heads suspended from the ceiling and exhibits for children such as    phuzzical education     a pair of googly eyes now dominate a sign plastered on the town   s local ball field  oil city stadium  reading     the fur is coming    to the men and women inside the costumes  there   s nothing funny about the notion of their characters being enshrined   barry anderson  who performed for more than a decade at chicago bulls games as benny the bull  who isn   t a member of the hall  choked up when talking about the prospect     i get very emotional about the work     said mr  anderson  who was known for his acrobatic trampoline dunks during time outs and firing t shirts into the crowd using a    bullzooka     benny the bull and  tommy hawk  the feathery frontman for the nhl   s chicago blackhawks  are considered strong candidates for the hall this year  says  dave raymond  ceo of the mascot hall of fame  on the thinking that it needs a chicago area member winning mascots are decided based on a mix of online popular voting and the votes of hall of fame executives and members  there are only     or so full time mascots for professional sports teams  along with scores more at the collegiate level who are typically manned by students  it is a close knit crew  when mr  boudwin got married in          of his mascot pals served in the wedding party  in full costume    john routh  who was the original billy the marlin for the miami marlins  and before that was  sebastian the ibis for the university of miami   said many of the professional performers started in the business during the mascot boom of the     s and     s  they are now thinking about their legacies rather than just the next skit    when you are young and dumb and in a costume  you think you are invincible     said mr  routh  whose characters aren   t in the hall despite the wear and tear he incurred     my motto was always to sacrifice the body for the laugh   now i   m paying for it    the museum is the brainchild of mr  raymond  the original phillie phanatic   the portly green mascot of the philadelphia phillies  known for his playful taunts of umpires and opposing players  mr  raymond  who played the part from      to       is considered by many    the best who   s ever put on a costume     said mr  routh  mr  raymond conceived of the idea for a virtual hall of fame in      to celebrate the individuals he calls    the true unsung heroes of sports     at first  many weren   t scratching and clawing to be included    is this serious      brian bunting recalls thinking  he was one of several ohio state university students in a rotation performing as the school   s mascot brutus buckeye     it was a virtual museum     said mr  anderson  the erstwhile benny the bull     i was like  ok  i   m a virtual millionaire    in the years that followed  the mascots    competitive spirit kicked in  mr  boudwin produced glowing letters from the mayor of houston and several business leaders as part of his nomination packet   former president  george h w  bush didn   t respond to requests  mr  boudwin says   jazz bear  from the utah jazz basketball team  submitted a video in which utah sen   orrin hatch extolled the mascot   s significance in the community  the video ended with the camera panning out to reveal jazz bear polishing the senator   s shoes  both jazz bear and clutch were part of the hall   s second class in      the following year  brutus buckeye made the cut   but not without controversy mr  bunting  now    and an engineer  said he and others involved in the school   s mascot program noticed there was no mechanism preventing people from voting online multiple times  they spread the word around campus that brutus fans should vote early and often  including in announcements made at the school   s         seat football stadium     we definitely wanted to win     mr  bunting said  mr  raymond said brutus far outpaced other mascots in the popular vote that year  indicating what he called    disparities    in the process  he has now tweaked the system to prevent multiple votes  but credits the experience with giving him the motivation to pursue a bricks and mortar museum he remembers thinking that    if someone is willing to take the time to develop something to circumvent our system  we   ve tapped into something    the next slate of candidates  which will likely include three professional and three collegiate mascots  will be announced at the oct     groundbreaking for the museum  meanwhile  the city and mr  raymond are trying to raise another    million from private donations to pay for the museum   s exhibits as it happens  the groundbreaking will take place the week after the release of the latest film by writer and director  christopher guest  who has previously skewered community theater and dog shows in mock documentaries including    waiting for guffman    and    best in show     his latest is called    mascots     and follows a group of fictional mascots as they angle for the most prestigious award in the field  the golden fluffy many professional mascots said they hope the filmmaker will be gentle    but it   s hard to begrudge someone for making fun     mr  boudwin says     we   re a bunch of professional idiots at the end of the day     write to brad reagan at brad reagan wsj com  corrections   amplifications    brutus buckeye was in the second class of college mascots to be inducted in the mascot hall of fame  an earlier version of this article incorrectly said he was the first college mascot inducted   sept
