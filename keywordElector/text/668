 first introduced to its phones in       the seal provides slightly less protection than the one on samsung   s latest phones   it   s a nominal difference  one can sit in up to   meter of water for    minutes  the other can sit in     meters of water   regardless  it   s a lifeline if your phone drops into a pool  or someplace more dirty   a lifeline all previous iphones lacked  camera  apple lost its crown for the best phone camera to samsung earlier this year  but the iphone   has an improved sensor and a lens that opens up to f     previously  it was f      that means much better night shots the larger iphone   plus has perhaps the only drool worthy new feature apple debuted on wednesday  two lenses on the back   a trick we saw from lg and huawei earlier this year  the iphone   plus    dual cameras allows it to better zoom into scenes  and add depth effects normally associated with expensive slr cameras  apple showed off sample nighttime photos that looked solid  but the camera is one of the most important elements i   ll be testing in the field  headphone  as you may have heard  apple giveth and apple taketh away  the iphone   drops the standard headphone jack  but comes with earbuds that plug into the lightning port  plus a dongle so you can still use your old favorite wired headphones  apple   s rationale for this change   that we want too much jammed into our tiny phones   fell flat to me  it   s an annoyance  but one i think we   ll get used to soon enough  and with its      airpods  apple is helping to usher in a new generation of totally wireless earbuds that will make using any device more pleasant most dangerous for apple   s cachet  there remain areas where the iphone   lags behind the competition  its screen  while     brighter and more colorful than ever  still has only a fraction of the resolution on samsung   s latest  photos and text look less crisp on the iphone screen  and the low resolution also keeps it from being effective for new experiences like vr in styling  samsung   s flagships now take the screen right up to the edge   the iphone   still has a border that looks oh so      aside from the airpods  apple didn   t really bolster its world of software and services  either  there   s a new apple watch with a faster processor and better waterproofing that will appeal to athletes  but there   s no new hardware like amazon   s echo speaker that could bring the siri experience into the home   s common spaces all of this adds up to a pretty incremental update to everything except possibly the camera  but little improvements may increase your happiness as much a radical new design  for anyone using an iphone  s or earlier  the iphone   will certainly feel like a big deal for everyone else  welcome to the new normal  in the maturing smartphone business  innovations are fewer  all the more reason to hold on to our phones longer  write to geoffrey a  fowler at geoffrey fowler wsj com or on twitter  geoffreyfowler
