 park  the cubs were three outs away from having to play a decisive fifth game of the division series at wrigley field on thursday night  all they did next was stage one of the greatest comebacks in postseason history ben zobrist drove in one run with a double down the right field line  willson contreras drove in two to tie the game with a ground ball up the middle  and javier b  ez smacked yet another grounder through the middle of the field to bring home heyward    hitting before the ninth inning is clearly overrated     cubs president of baseball operations  theo epstein said during the clubhouse celebration afterward     to go from a precarious position to champagne  it doesn   t usually happen that quickly    the cubs became the second team in major league history to rally from three runs down in the ninth inning to win a postseason clincher  the other team was the      new york mets  who staged a similar comeback in the nlcs and went on to win the world series the giants went through five pitchers in the ninth inning  exposing a weak bullpen that ended their streak of    consecutive victories in postseason elimination games  in the course of winning the world series in            and       the giants became the poster team for the unpredictability of playoff baseball  but what the cubs did after leading the majors with     wins in the regular season was predictable  if hardly assured the team getting the breaks is the one that has earned them     we really feel like they deserve good things     epstein said the cubs will open the nlcs at home on saturday against either the washington nationals or the los angeles dodgers  who will face each other in game   of the division series in washington on thursday night  it will mark chicago   s second consecutive appearance in the nlcs  where they were swept last year by the new york mets 
   hitting before the ninth inning is clearly overrated    
back then  the cubs were a revelation  reaching the playoffs for the first time under epstein  by the time they arrived in san francisco this week  ahead     in the division series  a return to the nlcs was all but taken for granted  that  coupled with the cubs    tortuous history  is what made the possibility of a game   fraught with tension    if you   re a player on this particular team within the organization  it   s getting to the point now you want to expect to get to the postseason and you want to expect to get deeply into the postseason     cubs manager joe maddon said the giants stayed alive by winning a    inning classic on monday night and rode an eight inning gem from starter matt moore on tuesday  but the moment their bullpen got busy  everything changed  the cubs tied the game before so much as making a single out in the ninth inning with contreras on first base  heyward lowered his bat to try to bunt him over  the ball came off too hard  straight to giants pitcher will smith  who threw out contreras at second  but the throw to first by shortstop brandon crawford sailed wide and into foul territory  allowing heyward to advance not only were the cubs in the same position they would have been in had heyward done what he was trying to do  but since heyward is a faster runner than contreras  they were better positioned to score a run off the kind of hit that came next  baez   s grounder up the middle it was the kind of sequence the giants have made a habit of this time of year  putting the ball in play and watching the result work out in their favor  resilience meeting fortune  and not entirely by coincidence    luck is a great thing     heyward said     but how you handle being down is a better thing     write to brian costa at brian costa wsj com
