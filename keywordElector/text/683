articles a change of tune at the americana honors and awards            nashville  tenn  promulgators of americana music  which has fresh turns on american roots music as its core  never intended for it to be any less flexible than older genres   country  rhythm and blues  jazz  pop  as those more familiar styles have long demonstrated  musical categories that last are elastic  sounds evolve  or genres and formats fade away at its inauguration as a recognized charted radio format in       self identified americana stations and record labels placed particular emphasis on country tinged alternative rock  rootsy  often texas based singer songwriter balladry  and more traditional country sounds of the     s   s that no longer appealed to mainstream  top    country  the    alternative country    label of the day fit the chart and the records found on it   so well that some puzzled outside observers and some from within the fledgling americana music association   s membership were critical of how that version of    americana    seemed to ignore or exclude vital contemporary music with a blues  soul  or african american gospel basis  that was a generation ago as makers and fans of the form arrive here for the annual week long americanafest music festival and conference  including wednesday   s   th americana honors and awards show  they will encounter a lineup of major award nominees and honorees that reflects a striking readjustment of the lively  expanding field   s emerging emphasis   a strong tilt toward sounds that echo classic soul music   al green  otis redding and the staple singers are as likely to be emerging americana artists    points of reference now as  hank williams  townes van zandt and the flying burrito brothers   william bell   the stax records soul star of the     s and composer of such regularly recorded standards as    you don   t miss your water    and  along with  booker t  jones     born under a bad sign      will be honored for life achievement in songwriting  the americana awards show   s jocular emcee for the past    years  prolific singer songwriter  jim lauderdale  will be receiving the    wagonmaster    award for extraordinary contributions to american roots music  his latest album  coincidentally  is    soul searching     which includes one disc recorded in nashville  and one in memphis with horn and keyboard instrumentation to match for       nominations for americana emerging artist of the year  duo group of the year  artist of the year  and album of the year all spotlight multiple performers with notably more r b influence in their singing and playing than country  the trend revealing emerging artist category includes  leon bridges  the talented young african american balladeer being touted  somewhat facilely perhaps  as a    new  sam cooke    because of the easy  crooning performance style he   s developing  another contender   nathaniel rateliff  explicitly left behind his previous style   that of a subtle yet folky singer songwriter   to lead his rhythmic memphis style soul band  the night sweats  with equal finesse  the groups nominated include the genre busting    funk meets punk    alabama shakes  and lake street dive  whose debut album     side pony     overseen by nashville   s producer of the moment dave cobb   mines a combination of beatles instrumentation and motown like vocalizing  mr  cobb himself will be in  buddy miller   s always versatile awards show band  two of the massively successful artists he   s produced   chris stapleton and  jason isbell   both of whom cross country  soul and southern rock lines   are nominated for artist of the year  and their releases for album of the year since the other artist of the year nominees are  bonnie raitt and  lucinda williams  who   ve been building music around blues for decades  and the other releases nominated for album of the year are ms  williams   s    the ghosts of highway       and  parker millsap   s gospel  and blues influenced    the very last day     the degree to which sounds derived from african american gospel and soul have permeated today   s americana is conspicuous  while what was once called    blue eyed soul    predominates  that   s not the whole story  among the artists headlining the week long festival are the veteran  charmingly suggestive soul blues artist bobby rush  drumming ace and songwriter  cedric burnside  who melds his family   s famed hill country blues with hip hop elements  and such newcomers as the racially integrated  soulful young female duo the muddy magnolias  british raised soul singer  yola carter  and banjo wielding canadian  kaia kater  who brings afro caribbean roots to bluegrass let   s not  however  overstate the degree or freshness of this shift toward affectionate  knowing updates on      s and early      s soul sounds  the evolved neo soul creativity that artists ranging from  jill scott and  john legend to  d   angelo and  alicia keys have been contributing to mainstream pop for years  or other post      s r b trends  are relatively rarely acknowledged or built on within americana thus far  but then  you can   t revive what   s still current more    traditional    americana spheres are not  however  going under recognized  margo price  with her new hard country turns  and sometimes harrowing     lyrics first    singer songwriter  john moreland are the other two emerging artist nominees  other headliners and honorees include  dwight yoakam  john prine  the grateful dead   s bob weir  emmylou harris    rodney crowell  and  wanda jackson  no americana threads are being left behind   but the older standbys have a less all defining role in the fabric  mr  mazor  based in nashville  reviews country and roots
