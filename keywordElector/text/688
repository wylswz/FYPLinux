   our quarterback ratings and stats are collectively a team stat  it is not all on one person at all  especially eli    
manning has been a physical marvel as an nfl quarterback  with a reputation for avoiding the big hits that cost other quarterbacks games  seasons and careers  he has started an incredible     consecutive games for the giants going back to       the third longest streak in nfl history and by far the most of any active player  but whether baker   s sack had a physical or merely mental effect on manning  the giants    passing attack has clearly fallen off a cliff since it happened apart from manning himself  the play highlighted another concern the giants have had all season  blocking on the offensive line early in the second quarter of the redskins game on sept      baker beat giants guard john jerry off the line and laid a square hit to manning   s chest  driving him into the turf and causing the ball to come loose  manning had led the giants to two touchdowns and a      lead to that point  but went on to throw two second half interceptions in a       loss  since baker   s hit  manning has completed    of     pass attempts          with one touchdown and three interceptions  before the hit  he had completed    of his first    passes          with four touchdowns and one interception the following week in minnesota  manning wasn   t sacked by the ferocious vikings defense  but he hastily threw the ball away on several plays before giants receivers had time to get into their routes  he finished the game    of     the following week  manning recorded season lows in completions       yards       and yards per attempt        against the   th ranked pass defense of the green bay packers  who were without their top two cornerbacks  sam shields and damarious randall  manning said the simple explanation to the team   s slump is execution     it wasn   t really coverages that slowed us down     he said     we had penalties  had sacks and those things that put us back  so you just have to understand that it is just a matter of playing better    one thing that hasn   t helped is the running game  which ranks   th in the nfl this season  rashad jennings has missed the past three games with a thumb injury  and third down back shane vereen is out indefinitely since suffering a triceps injury against washington  with bobby rainey leading the way  the giants managed just    rushing yards against green bay  jennings is optimistic that he   ll be ready to return on sunday against the baltimore ravens  who boast the league   s third ranked defense  he also said the quarterback often gets too much credit when a team is winning  and too much blame when a team is losing    our quarterback ratings and stats are collectively a team stat     jennings said     it is not all on one person at all  especially eli    the giants    inability to run the ball has already created an imbalance in their mix of runs and passes   of the team   s     offensive plays this season        have been passes     you want balance as an offense with the run and the pass     said receiver victor cruz     obviously  us not being consistent in the run game plays a part in the pass game as well    asked if he thought the    year old manning has shown any signs of injury or age  cruz shook his head     he knows his body  better  than anyone  i   m convinced he   s playing until he   s        write to jim chairusmi at jim chairusmi wsj com
