articles the return of africas strongmen           on the same november morning when boko haram seized yet another village in nigeria   s north  police in riot gear surrounded the country   s house of representatives in the capital city of abuja  but they weren   t guarding the country   s parliament against an assault by the notorious islamist insurgency  they were there to block a politician from casting his vote nigeria   s speaker of the house  aminu tambuwal  had recently defected to the opposition   a risky move in a government dominated by one party  a court had ruled that he could keep his speaker   s chair  but police at the barricades outside said that he couldn   t  they stopped his car at the gate nigerian lawmakers were scheduled to vote on whether to renew a bill that allows soldiers to detain suspects without cause in areas threatened by boko haram   s gunmen  mr  tambuwal expected to lead the legislative bloc opposed to this grant of sweeping state powers  instead  the police fired tear gas and effectively shut down the nigerian parliament  nigeria   s political drama is just one example of a disquieting trend across the continent  two decades of elections and economic progress in africa haven   t erased the vast power that militaries have long wielded in many countries  large and small  in much of africa  in fact  the armed forces have gained influence in recent years as battling islamist terrorists has become a priority    there are signs of the predatory nature of military rule    returning to africa  said  larry diamond  director of stanford university   s center on democracy  development and the rule of law     this is a calamity for a number of these countries    to friends of democratic development  africa   s    countries pose perhaps the world   s most important test of whether representative institutions can flourish amid low living standards and rapidly changing economies  leaders from the u s   europe and latin america have visited the continent to promote open  politically accountable government  they know that china  africa   s biggest trading partner  is offering a rival model in the form of market powered autocracy for now  the advance of democracy in africa appears to have stalled  in       just three of africa   s    countries were electoral democracies  according to freedom house  a washington based pro democracy advocacy group  by       that number had leapt to     two decades later  only    qualify this disappointing record raises difficult questions about the possibility of poor countries becoming durable democracies  several african states   botswana and zambia  for instance   seem to be headed in that direction  rising middle classes there are demanding more accountability and transparency from their governments  and public services are gradually improving  but many more african countries  such as angola and sudan  are resource rich  single party autocracies that have consolidated their grip on power  thanks in part to high oil prices and low interest loans from china  some political scientists hope that a slowing chinese economy   and dropping crude oil prices   could give a second wind to democracy in africa  forcing closed regimes to hold elections in return for western loans but spreading democracy isn   t as simple as dangling aid and applauding elections  democratization experts say  even hopeful cases like ghana and benin must confront long histories of military rule woven into their political evolution  in many african countries  soldiers have run the show since the earliest days of colonialism  in the late     s  europeans recruited local men into new armies to help conquer a vast continent  throughout the imperial century that followed  europeans used those colonial brigades to repress the african lawyers  civil servants and journalists who were agitating for independence after world war ii  britain  france and other european empires withdrew  but the militaries of many newly independent african states continued to suppress their own civil societies  africa weathered more than    coups between      and       according to the african development bank  some overturned election results that military leaders found unpalatable  others promised to stamp out political corruption  took over and became corrupt themselves  many of these regimes relied on cold war era patronage from washington or moscow  soviet patrons often found themselves bankrupt after the soviet union collapsed in       and the u s  lost interest in supporting corrupt regimes such as zaire under  mobutu sese seko in the post cold war era  dozens of african countries tried to escape financial trouble by staging elections in return for u s  loans and aid  the soldiers who once lorded over countries such as ghana and nigeria returned to their barracks  after the al qaeda attacks of sept            many african governments began to receive military training from u s  officials seeking new allies in their war on islamist terror africa   s politics have been relatively stable over the past decade  and african economies have surged  vast reserves of oil  gas and minerals helped to attract     billion in foreign direct investment in       the u n  says   triple the     billion that arrived a decade earlier  economic growth  almost flat    years ago  will reach    this year  according to the african development bank   a rate higher than any region except asia that growth has empowered a new middle class  in senegal  uganda  kenya and elsewhere  cosmopolitan young consumers have rallied to demand western style democracy  political scientists had hoped that this rising constituency would convince soldiers that they were better off reaping the benefits of economic advance from the sidelines than standing in democracy   s way but it often hasn   t worked out that way  despite rapid economic growth  africa   s civic institutions remain weak  struggling to provide basic services  public hospitals in west africa are fighting an uphill battle against ebola  child protection agencies are watching young constituents join islamist rebellions in nigeria and kenya against this backdrop of weak state capacity  african armies stand out for the manpower and funding they enjoy  they are also increasingly well organized  the u s  trained some        african troops in      alone  at a cost of     million  so when trouble brews  african presidents and protesters alike often turn to the most capable institution at their disposal     when you feel some imminent danger  you call the military     said mulbah morlu  a leader of liberia   s top opposition party  but his own country   s history shows the risks of that approach  after liberia   s    year civil war ended in       the u s  paid security contractor dyncorp international  based in mclean  va   to train the country   s new        person army  other institutions like the health ministry received scant attention the ebola crisis has exposed that gap  some liberian doctors abandoned their posts when the epidemic exploded in june and july  the country   s health ministry struggled to track individuals crisscrossing the country carrying the deadly virus  frustrated  president  ellen johnson sirleaf called in the military that was the wrong move  ms  johnson sirleaf now says  instead of isolating individuals with the virus  her soldiers quarantined whole neighborhoods   at one point firing shots into a crowd and killing a teenage boy  that scared people elsewhere into hiding their sick neighbors  and the virus spread exponentially     i did not know what to do     ms  johnson sirleaf said last week     capacity is always an issue with us    embattled presidents aren   t the only ones asking african armies for help  in some of africa   s poorest countries   mali  guinea  niger   groups fighting for democracy say that they are fine with the occasional military led ouster of an elected leader  if a coup is what it takes to speed the democratic process    civil society  because of its frustration  wants a transitional process     says  alex vines  an africa analyst  at the london based think tank chatham house     in the short term  a military coup is seen as expedient    that is what happened last month in burkina faso  a quiet democracy in turbulent west africa  a former army officer   blaise compaor    had won four elections and governed for    years  the constitution banned him from a fifth run  when he tried to change the constitution to seek one anyway  tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets and set fire to government buildings  demanding that he leave the constitution alone amid the chaos  an odd alliance formed  protesters rallied behind mr  compaor     s own security detail  officers seized power and promised new elections within a year  the next morning  protesters thronged back into the streets and started sweeping  a symbolic gesture meant to welcome their new military rulers    it is we in civil society that insisted the army come and restore order     says aristide zongo  executive director of the burkinab   association for reducing child mortality     from my point of view  it   s quite acceptable    this isn   t how democracy advocates had hoped that africa would progress  in the     s  activists argued that democracy would pave the way for development  elections would make african presidents accountable  those presidents would improve governance and expand services  as governance improved  big companies would flock to the continent but that virtuous cycle hasn   t taken hold  though the end of the cold war did nudge many african autocrats toward elections  businesses rushed in far faster than governance improved  today  blue chip companies such as  wal mart stores inc

 are expanding into countries whose leaders have never faced a real electoral contest  elections have now been held across the continent  but their credibility varies  in some countries  rulers deploy state security forces to marginalize opposition leaders  less autocratic leaders foster loyalty by doling out state jobs and other perks that would raise eyebrows even in many developing nations  a whole generation of elected leaders is now angling for more time in power  next year  both faure gnassingb   of togo and  joseph kabila of congo are expected to seek third terms   mr  kabila will have to change congo   s constitution to do so  togo has no term limits   both men inherited power from their fathers  who were ex military leaders  other african leaders are even more entrenched  angola   s president   jos   eduardo dos santos  is a military commander who has used his country   s vast oil wealth to build a police network that has helped to neutralize rivals for more than    years  in       his party won more than two thirds of the vote in elections that observers called deeply flawed   robert mugabe      has ruled zimbabwe since       this week  he tightened his grip on power at a party conference by sidelining perceived rivals and backing his    year old wife  grace  for a senior party post  and former rebel commander  paul kagame  rwanda   s president since       is widely believed to be weighing a constitutional amendment that would allow him to remain in power beyond his second elected seven year term  which is set to end in       he says that he will do what rwandans ask of him  the youth of the continent   s population makes it harder for these autocrats to gauge the political winds circling around them  half of africans are under     for many of them  faster economic growth hasn   t translated into jobs and better living standards  and they don   t necessarily identify with opposition leaders  who are often as old as the presidents they seek to dislodge  some view the military as the best of a bad set of options for the u s   this is complicated terrain  washington wants to build up africa   s civil society but also its armies  in       during his first visit to the continent as president  barack obama told ghana   s parliament that    africa doesn   t need strongmen  it needs strong institutions     yet mr  obama   s time in office has coincided with the rise of islamist insurgencies in africa such as boko haram in nigeria and al shabaab in somalia  much u s  effort has thus gone to training soldiers  not building health ministries or electoral commissions the result has been to create strong armies in weak states  said  sean mcfate  a former dyncorp official who trained soldiers in burundi and liberia     if the most capable institution is the military  in a crisis  that is what the country is going to lean on  whether that is the appropriate tool or not     he said the military remains a swaggering presence in nigeria  africa   s most populous country  on the surface  the country is a flourishing democracy  its economy has averaged    growth annually during the four year term of president  goodluck jonathan  one of the first elected nigerian leaders who didn   t come from the military  but nigeria   s army   which led the country almost nonstop from      to        still wields considerable power  a fifth of nigeria   s nearly     billion budget goes to the armed forces still  the military has repeatedly lost ground to boko haram   a fanatical sect that until recently was armed with just bows  arrows and swords  soldiers who complain that they lack bullets and body armor have abandoned a swath of northeastern nigeria as large as belgium  meanwhile  their superiors have spent lavishly on flashy equipment  including newly purchased russian made helicopters that have crashed because nigerian officers can   t communicate with the ukrainian pilots hired to fly them  said one security adviser  mr  jonathan has defended his army   s efforts  when kashim shettima  the governor of a state in boko haram   s heartland  complained that the army was being gutted by corruption  mr  jonathan threatened on television to remove the soldiers guarding mr  shettima   s house  exposing him to attack by boko haram the military has defended mr  jonathan  too  soldiers have blocked opposition leaders from landing at airports during their campaigns  and in june  soldiers confiscated bundles of newspapers containing articles criticizing government corruption   the defense ministry later said that the newspapers were being used to sneak terrorist supplies around the country     our soldiers are not involved in politics     said nigeria   s military spokesman  brig  gen  chris olukolade  who declined to comment on individual incidents  in a statement  mr  jonathan   s office said     it is absolutely wrong to accuse this administration of repression  if anything  this administration has been most tolerant of opposition    in october  mr  tambuwal  the speaker of the house  broke ranks with mr  jonathan  the police soon recalled his bodyguards  when they blocked his sedan from entering nigeria   s house of representatives last month  lawmakers helped mr  tambuwal to enter through a side gate  police chased them down and shot tear gas into the building   s lobby  by noon  the legislature of africa   s largest democracy was shut down boko haram spent the day driving unchallenged into the remote village of azaya kura  fighters killed at least    people there  residents said  then slipped back into the woods    matina stevis in johannesburg contributed to this article   corrections   amplifications an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that rwanda   s paul kagame is in his third seven year term as president  he is in his second elected term
