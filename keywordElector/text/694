 where most users start watching video ads in their news feeds without any sound by default  facebook has urged advertisers to orient their videos to take that fact into account by  for example  including captions    we think we have the best ads in mobile     said imran khan  chief strategy officer mr  khan clearly knows that brands won   t just take his word for it  the new moat partnership is the latest public maneuver aimed at helping to provide major marketers with a level of third party verification for advertising on snapchat to convince them to spend more money on such ads over the past year  snapchat has partnered with the ad tech companies sizmek and innovid and media researchers nielsen and millward brown  all in an effort to help major marketers feel comfortable advertising on the platform and potentially moving ad budgets to snapchat from tv to that end  snapchat is also set to release new research conducted by the firm mediascience designed to compare the impact of snapchat video ads with tv and other platforms  plus  advertisers will also be able to use google   s doubleclick ad tracking software to collect data on campaigns gunnard johnson  who was recently installed as snapchat   s new head of quantitative ads research  said that the company now works with    media measurement partners  up from one a year ago as for the moat deal  the analytics firm has become well known in digital media circles over the past several years by helping web publishers prove that their ads are viewable   meaning that they are visible to consumers on their various screens  that   s not necessarily a huge issue for snapchat  which doesn   t have a desktop site where ads may be delivered to a part of a webpage that doesn   t appear on a user   s screen still  employing moat data should help snapchat tout its high scores on viewability  which could help differentiate it from other platforms and draw in more advertising dollars plus  moat is using this snapchat deal to roll out a set of new metrics designed to help brands gauge things like time spent with ads and screen real estate   areas where snapchat   s full screen mobile ads should score high    we obviously don   t have a viewability issue     said mr  khan     but we want to move the industry forward  advertisers are confused by all the different definitions out there of viewability and other metrics  we hear from them a lot  so everybody wins if mobile gets this right     write to mike shields at mike shields wsj com
