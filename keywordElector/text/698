articles cmo today trump fights media over new groping allegations            trump vs  times  as the fallout from donald trump   s lewd      video continues  several new accusations against the gop presidential candidate could add to the damage  the new york times reported wednesday on two women  jessica leeds and rachel crooks  who say that mr  trump touched them inappropriately  mr  trump

and apology  calling the article    reckless    and    defamatory     cnn reports  suing could open up mr  trump to a messy discovery process  however  meanwhile  people carried a first person account from writer natasha stoynoff alleging that mr  trump forcibly kissed her when she was at mar a lago to interview the businessman in       and the palm beach post reported on a separate      incident  the trump campaign has denied all the allegations  the washington post reports  hit finder  josh sapan  the ceo of amc networks  arrived for the latest wsj media mix podcast taping with four scripts in his bag  that   s because the tv executive  like his competitors  is always on the hunt for the next big hit  mr  sapan   s flagship channel amc has made its mark through such programming  from    the walking dead    to    breaking bad     but with a proliferation of original programming and new competitors like netflix tossing out big sums for content  is it getting harder to gain traction with a new show  mr  sapan says it isn   t all about the money you   re willing to spend     it   s probably a greater challenge to identify the right thing and get the right thing  and money doesn   t always help     he said  mr  sapan also raised some doubts about industry fears over    skinny    bundles that offer fewer channels for a cheaper price  only sony and dish have national products in the market  and amc has a deal with both      everyone thinks there   s a million skinny bundles that are eroding the world  there are not  they are actually largely complementing it     mr  sapan

has been wondering for some time whether warner bros  would go ahead and acquire machinima  the video network specializing in gaming content in which it has been a major investor  now the information reports that the two are in advanced talks for a deal that would value machinima at under      million  that sounds like a nice round number  but it   s less attractive when you consider that warner bros  and other potential suitors passed on acquiring the company for      million earlier this year  the information noted  warner bros  in june created a new unit to house its digital holdings  like korean soap opera streaming service dramafever  which it acquired earlier this year  the group also managed the machinima holding  and presumably the entire company would fit into that unit should the
