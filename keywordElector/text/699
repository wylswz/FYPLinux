 data   i was also surprised by how little capital the fund needs to be viable  advisor shares points out that the patient is alive on the table if you have     million in the fund  ideally  you would want to have more  with     million under management  then you   d have something that is chugging along   wsj  will having an etf get in the way of the blog   mr  elfenbein  no  i can write about the stocks i recommend  but i have to steer clear of anything that smacks of marketing the fund the etf is going to track the buy list as closely as possible  with the picks equally weighted as much as sec regulations allow  the positions will be rebalanced once a year  we have to keep a small cash position due to the mechanics of the fund  we   ll start with       wsj  you   ve done something different in terms of the way you are going to be paid  please explain   mr  elfenbein  there will be a fulcrum fee for me  my pay will be based on performance relative to the s p      if the fund beats the benchmark  i get a bonus  if not  then i get a penalty  the size of the penalty is a based on a sliding scale and would result a reduction in the fund   s expenses the hedge funds just get bonuses  if they miss their benchmark they don   t get penalized   wsj  why an etf instead of a mutual fund   mr  elfenbein  it just seems that investors are voting with their dollars  we are moving from the world of mutual funds to etfs  there are tax benefits with the etfs   they are less subject to capital gains taxes than mutual funds  for example   i also like the fact that you can track the value during the day  whereas you can   t with a mutual fund plus  a lot of funds are very secretive about what they own  i   m the opposite  my buy list is completely free  so you get the complete transparency that you get with etfs here   s an odd comparison  years ago bands were trying to clamp down on bootleg tapes of concerts  the one group that was the opposite was the grateful dead  who reserved spaces for the people taping i don   t see how the transparency hurts me at all  mr  constable is a writer in new york  he can be reached at reports wsj com
