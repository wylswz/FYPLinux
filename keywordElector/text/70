project brief the purpos of thi project is two fold studi and understand how an exist design system work it philosophi aesthet and interact principl implement across variou applic observ it weak point and challeng it assumpt studi exist blog and social medium platform where they succeed and what is miss not just for ardent blogger but everyday user who explor onlin content a lot use these observ to reimagin googl s blogger blogspot platform when googl announc materi design at i o i wa sit at gdg s io extend event in googl s bangalor offic watch it unfold live at first when i heard the term materi my initi thought wa that googl must have invent some microfluid touchscreen or a new technolog that let you feel materi that you interact with i wa an engin back then and my dismay did not let me fulli appreci such a well thought out and adapt design system here s how some googler have defin it paraphras on the surfac materi can be seen a a union of skeuomorph and flat design take paper and ink a an inspir and turn them into tactil object with bright color elev and shadow and motion but what materi realli is a first well done attempt at come up with a design system for digit interfac and use the metaphor of paper to defin how object within said interfac present themselv and interact with each other it is more than just a defin set of spec or visual compon rather a philosophi of how inform should be commun to a user with mean hierarchi and intent you can read more about materi design on their offici guidelin i made some rough scribbl note here my main goal wa to implement thi design system to bring one of googl s own product blogger back to life blogger ha not receiv ani updat in the past few year it s app still ha a simpl editor interfac with no way of interact with other blog on blogspot i want to reimagin blogger a a new blog platform someth that combin the microblog of tumblr instagram snapchat and vine along with the long form content of medium or wordpress and the futur form of multimedia vr interact content without the nois and distract we face in place like facebook and with an interfac that encourag content discoveri with it eas of use but thi need to be more than a blatant applic of a design system or a simpl redesign without serv purpos or address ani need so i decid to first challeng materi design explor certain aspect and presumpt of the philosophi behind it and see if it work in context of real world applic with real everyday user especi those who are not design profession and are unawar of the purpos of thi design style for them the interfac is just anoth tool to get their job done i put these principl to test in the follow way with these question in mind i creat thi survey http goo gl form mgjj h qz afpsz by compil question that explor variou aspect of materi design it philosophi compon arrang style a well a real app websit exampl the question meant to test out how doe a user visual perceiv the system after respons with non design by individu in differ age group and differ profess i made the follow observ for the next step i explor the ux and design of the follow site wordpress medium tumblr instagram flipboard googl googl art cultur googl space googl travel googl inbox googl keep googl photo googl blog facebook snapchat vine pinterest twitter go through their signup and on board process integr of social network content discoveri profil and user engag a well a their implement of materi design on mobil and desktop if avail note down the pro con success design pattern interact and visual rough note avail here with all these observ in mind i began redesign googl s blogger befor jump onto the visual design i realli want to explor and understand what a blog is what is it purpos and who are it user in context of the present day a well a in the near futur consid how technolog is evolv peopl use a share platform to express their thought idea and emot they share experi opinion news inform and a lot more in variou form of medium but whi design a new blog system when other product alreadi exist the fact that blogger is dead is not a reason enough to design a new system is there a need for a new platform can we rethink the visual design and user experi of a blog with a new purpos one of my main goal wa to creat a platform for everi type of medium the onli one to do so is facebook but that is alway riddl with click bait ad and content we don t realli want to see the mix of person updat with page ad event and everyth els under the sun doesn t creat an environ conduc of content discoveri it note featur for long form content ha been lost in obscur despit recent updat i realli want to take the simplic of instagram and medium and give it the power of multimedia content even beyond tumblr and make content discoveri easier and simplifi it should realli feel like a place you come to share stori anoth need identifi wa to give blogger a new direct and avoid the mistak of it imperfect cousin googl which now feel just alien and noisi a new blog platform ha great potenti in thi age where we are constantli gener content share our thought and document our life onlin an immers experi can be creat out of thi need play off of all that i began my design process to reinvigor blogger blogger ha had a veri simplifi logo an orang background with a white b mark on it i did not want to detract too much from thi veri identifi mark but updat it to the current style of materi design adher to googl s methodolog i start to craft the logo use paper and arrang the element with differ elev and light after multipl iter and go through the current googl app product icon and the materi design guidelin on icon design the logo start to come togeth the background of the logo is mimick a journal or diari the tradit medium for write person stori but thi need to be updat for and beyond content would vari from magazin style articl and audio visual to interact content and even vr in the futur the logo need to repres the bold and power of the everyday user and their stori henc the final logo is the centerfold of an open book and the b is not just ink on paper but an entiti of it own that ha left the bound of the book and rest at a certain elev studi variou other blog platform and social network i went over how i would like to arrang the content and inform insid the app and tailor the user journey after some iter a well a discuss with a few activ blogger and social medium user that i person knew i came up with the follow structur signup and onboard have been slate for later develop after design the basic compon post card save post tile topic tile etc i design the wirefram and use marvel to creat a basic prototyp http marvelapp com f h b the wirefram prototyp were use to get initi feedback from other design and improv upon the design the bigger challeng wa design for desktop one of the main concern wa how to util space without use a multi column feed like we see on googl along with that anoth design pattern that i had in mind wa to make the header sticki for everi post in a feed till the entir post is scroll through the way it happen on instagram s app thi howev is not easili translat onto the desktop design stick the post header to the app bar look clunki and awkward so after a consid a coupl of design pattern and test them out by share gif for feedback i finalis thi one thi further push materi s concept of tactil quantum paper we know that compon can elev and allow other to pa abov or below them but can we transform materi asymmetr to improv content view i want the visual design to be more than just ui compon put togeth accord to some guidelin it need to serv differ use case and creat pattern to improv content discoveri and consumpt the wirefram prototyp and final design push on those idea home page as a user scroll through their feed the header for each post lift up to the same elev a the statu bar and stick there until the post is scroll through then it go back down to join the footer and scroll off the screen a differ to note between desktop and mobil blog post ui card is that the share icon is kept under the contextu menu on mobil while on the desktop it s kept on the card footer thi is becaus we do not want the user to stray away from the app on desktop it is much more accept to switch between applic and browser tab but on mobil ani action that can lead the user out of the app will be disengag howev we still want to provid the option if user choos to use it discov thi section is divid into part on mobil explor topic and blog each one offer differ aspect to content discoveri explor show you the trend post and editor pick or just brows through the latest public feed that will be curat over time for you the more you use the app under topic you can look for the latest trend hashtag and hot topic along with the collect of all the topic blogger offer to be follow thi will contribut to the curat of your explor feed final in the blog section you can look at the most trend blog search is alway avail while you are in discov mode to find more content the desktop design is slightli differ instead of divid the page into tab i creat a singl page with scrollabl section navdraw favourit and notif screen blogger profil thi is one of the most import part of blogger the profil need to stand out for everi individu but it still ha to be contain within the same platform and not look like an extern websit so consist of design with the rest of the applic is an import thing to consid thi can be achiev by allow the user to add their own profil pictur and cover imag from there blogger will select the most promin color from the cover imag use the palett librari then match it to closest color from materi design s color palett to beus a the primari color the profil s primari color play an import role in not just view the profil but also while view ani post from that blogger in expand mode the primari color seen abov are the same a one taken from the user blogger s profil cover imag shown below thi keep certain consist throughout all the blog post from the same user mobil http marvelapp com djcedd desktop http marvelapp com i a doe not reflect actual navig design or interact one of the biggest realiz while work on thi project wa that materi design is not just a visual style but more of a set of rule for digit interfac design it would evolv overtim and even do away with certain decor minutea and compon like the fab which doesn t alway work mayb even the whole paper ink concept but the underli principl will be there to stay anoth thing i realis wa how tough it is to follow a set design guidelin it keylin and metric and other aesthet rule it is alway easier to design the compon first then assembl the layout rather than come up with compon dure the main ui design stage thi will also demonstr that you thought about differ piec and compon of your app beforehand dure the ia stage thi is the begin iter for blogger s redesign i ll keep it a work in progress and take in more feedback befor i add it to my behanc and portfolio in realiti we would need to chang a lot a more and more peopl would use the applic give u an idea of what work what doesn t and what s miss but one can not deni that a perfect blog platform ha great potenti today and googl alreadi ha a posit to use it name and blogger to captur that audienc provid great integr with youtub and other googl servic and reimagin blog to creat the most engag and immers experi and a univers platform for everi kind of stori thank you for read
