the top and about your bottom line     walking around     an election special from the wall street     now     i see     here is veronica dagher     welcome to watching your wells presidential election series on veronica dagher     carol kroch is managing director of wealth and philanthropic planning at wilmington trust company welcome here     inky so much for him to countries that had he so before we go into the candidates  tax proposals we should first say     these proposals are aspirational and i     absolutely and sometimes calm and the campaign wish list     that pres they can enact tax proposals says whoever s alike just don t have to work for the new congress     and the composition and that congress which is can it be determined on election day is going to determine     what s realistic for the president to propose an and hope to get enacted     apsel it s a lot of unknowns also for our purposes here with a focus on ordinary income and adoption proposal is just for the sake of time     on folks if they want more information you can probably check out the candidate s website to get more t tell     so first let s look at ordinary income we now have seven     tax brackets with the top rate     of thirty nine point six percent     what     is going to propose an ominous     is proposing the scene and seven tax brackets     on to say isn t as scientists we talked through both the clinton and the term proposals     for anybody who s been watching president obama s proposals     for the past few years they look deeper eye familiar and for anybody who s been looking at republican tax reform     donald trump s bullet prefer million     the crime     so she s a similar time in terms of what obama has done or     is thinking about clinton proposes the scene current tax brackets with the highest tax rate of thirty nine point six percent     which is the number that of course     is of interest to higher net worth individuals higher earners     but she s also proposing a four percent surtax on adjusted gross income over five million     so that would be an addition one     so we took a seat think that impact affected happened about four percent surtax on easy i would now     well     it means people are and was a little bit more on their adjusted gross income     so in effect instead of having a thirty nine point six percent rate on     income over five million a year and have     a forty three point six percent free     um     so it s an additional cost to taxpayers a little while a plus in your pocket and the date on what the trouble is he proposing to     try it proposed in     initially three tax brackets with the top three of twenty five percent     in the last month the keys to move to that     it operates up to thirty three percent     now it     if you look so well or that top tax rate to thirty three percent     i m from what we have now that that happened thirty nine point six percent     where is he going to make up that tax revenue has he said anything about     well i think the biggest thing he said is he msged and twenty five to thirty three     because the revenue numbers were     so     hard     the difficulty that and i think it was something like ninety     million     terry trillion dollars     that he did shift     on to say that is a shift to make it to the fair for the deficit in terms of further guidance though he hasn t listened to much i know i think there s been a suggestion and there still would be a deficit with a thirty three percent rate     i think there s been a suggestion that he may need people to     change some of their revenue line three deductions but he hasn t put out specifics i     got it at any step takeaway is to answer top line for investors based on dietary these proposals     what you know     i wish that we can give people more definitive guidance this early in the race     i m i m adopted a term that is he s taught in the medical field which is watchful waiting     because rate now it s hard to say i think that it s realistic to think     that     if     one of these candidates gets affected of course one of them well     and if it is with the congress that     follows along with their thinking     you might see some increased tax rates in its current name nights we see some decreased if it struck     by a bikini when all is really in the conference and so     it s hard to say right now which is going to happen or a year s time     indeed     the     deductions is as off on a scary topic     right now if you re married for agi of over roughly three hundred and eleven thousand dollars     itemize deductions and personal exemptions fees now what is clinton proposing the syria     what     is proposing is to an account on them in a fit     that taxpayers derives from cheaper to that deductions     except for charitable deduction     and that cap     is     to reduce the valley of introduction to a taxpayer who earns more than twenty eight percent     just to twenty percent     it still is that debt texans can happen what would she folks do before that happens it then as possible should they     aam get more to charity you wore excel or eater um it s even some of their own     deductions are     why think you get exactly on the point     if you know what s going happen and you don t know that now and     then you can take advantage if the cheekily entering a charitable because the nine deductions you don t have a choice     given it a pure state income tax     it means that you of that year he unveiled a doctor     but with charitable     if you got here and and you really thought that this was the     unlikely possibility you might     get more deductions tea your deductions this year     say i ll pay little more and for charity this year and do last next year     i think the reality is most of this tax change if it happens in on them     and we have seen the man when congress doesn t have     it we sixty votes in the senate they re all lined     with very little happens     if it happens that all is much more likely to happen in twenty seventeen i think people are going have a lock tree think about this     but that s definitely how you approach     a change in an unfavorable changing deductions is to accelerate time     to time that s more favorable year when the pre pay any bills is that possible about health and home than in the same notion if you ve caught     state local property taxes     that you can t repay and it seems to make sense to prepay     you can certainly do that     i think you just have to again putting on that watchful waiting mode     watch what s going on because you may end up just with more     cash flow     this year     you can end up losing some of your deductions because you get subject to the phase out     and if they don t change so i haven t really gained anything can get frustrating for taxpayers to give a     lot of unknowns out what is trump or frozen when it comes the deductions     he does plan to create some limits on itemized deductions     so be watching the debate see if there s     any for dd telfer men on that     will quickly averted gary johnson on all these issues     you know he falls in a very different approach     what he would do is eliminate the income tax     in the estate tax     and instead have the consumption tax that he refers to is a fair chance     so it s similar to your may be identical to the value added tax     he hasn t provided a lot of specifics he says it would be revenue neutral and that means that the     rate     will depend on how     the numbers play out     so it seems like in all this it s a lot of a watchful waiting is we don t know what s gonna happen     it s a joke on january first or even before that when all the election results are in     should we be taking action and abortion we still we     well     i think     the first question is can mean a look at the congressman is if you get to november nine     in you ve got a congress     that looks squarely able to act     because in fact it s got more than that magic sixty votes     so the are not facing filibusters     you re not using so called cloture motions     to     congress that looks likely to be in the land     that is aligned with the press and an     awesome both parties and i think it s very likely     that mean i really mon n roll up your sleeves     otherwise i think anyone is still engaged in a little bit of watchful waiting     great it s things for joining us carol     cree to be with you
