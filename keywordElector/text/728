articles why the best leaders want their superstar employees to leave           should bosses try to hold on to their star performers for most of corporate america  the question might seem like nonsense  star performers are seen as so valuable that managers should pull out all the stops to keep them   or else see their companies take a big hit in productivity yet some of the best managers not only allow their top performers to leave  but actively encourage it i   ve spent the past    years studying the world   s greatest bosses across    industries  luminaries such as ralph lauren in fashion  julian robertson in hedge funds  norman brinker in casual restaurants  larry ellison in technology  michael miles in packaged food  jay chiat in advertising and tommy frist jr  in hospitals  to name a few as i was surprised to discover  these extraordinary leaders achieved outstanding results in large part because they abandoned conventional thinking about keeping the best employees they weren   t afraid to lose their best people  on the contrary  most willingly unleashed their top performers onto the world  going out of their way to help them land outside opportunities  the leaders i studied built iconic businesses  transformed entire industries and in a number of instances became billionaires not by hoarding great people for themselves  but by mastering the flow of talent through their organizations doing so will make an organization far more resilient  sustainable and successful over the long term  the talent flow strategy is also better tailored to many of today   s abiding business realities  including volatile markets that demand more dynamic workforces  a generation of millennials less inclined to stick around for loyalty   s sake  and an entrepreneurial  gig economy that encourages frequent shifts in employment over the course of an individual   s career the stories of these bosses reveal a crucial shared belief  you   re better off having the best people for a short time than average people forever the bosses were uncompromising when it came to recruiting  they didn   t want average  they wanted mind blowing  they searched high and low for unusually talented individuals  often experimenting with nontraditional hires  and tolerating higher levels of churn when some of these hires didn   t work out  but once unusually talented people were inside the organizations  the bosses accepted that some would leave  top employees  the bosses realized  were almost always on a rapid growth trajectory  they were ultra ambitious  perpetually angling for the next big opportunity  and it stood to reason that at least some of them would eventually need to leave the company to keep their careers moving ahead one leader told me that it was    normal    for people to want to pursue their own interests after a while     we let these people go on an individual basis  and they left with their heads high and with great feelings toward us  it was probably the most successful thing we ever did    another said     you can   t keep good people down  and if they get a really good opportunity that you can   t match  it   s inevitable you   re going to lose them  but that   s the price you pay for having really outstanding people    unlike most corporate chiefs  the bosses i studied were quite willing to pay that price  exceptional talent  they thought  is well worth dealing with greater turnover  after all  these bosses were certainly not oblivious to the price of losing top talent as these bosses also understood  such turnover isn   t nearly as destructive as most managers think  when a stream of top performers go on to better things  the departures usually hasten the flow of more top talent into the company  outstanding bosses who let their top talent leave developed reputations as launchpads  their companies were places to go to supercharge a career high potential prospects began flocking to these bosses and not their competitors  eager for a chance to train with the best  build their r  sum   and partake of the bosses    magic  talented young people were so excited to work for these bosses that they even accepted below market pay  bosses such as messrs  chiat  ellison and lucas became widely known as    the guy    to work for in their industries because of all the prominent people who had come through their organizations and gone on to spectacular careers if the notion of being a talent magnet seems abstract compared with the tangible loss when a great person leaves  try a thought experiment  imagine you have outstanding young people  each smarter and more creative and ambitious then the last  knocking on your door every day in that context  saying goodbye to some of your best people doesn   t seem especially risky  does it  on the contrary  it becomes desirable  since it makes room for more up and comers eager for their chance  in this scenario  your goal in managing talent is not to keep any one person  but to do what it takes to establish a strong talent flow  and to remove any impediments to that flow the bosses i studied also took advantage of a wonderful paradox  when you stop hoarding your people and focus on creating a talent flow  you find that more of your top people actually do wind up staying  most people who worked for bosses like messrs  chiat  brinker or frist didn   t want to work for anybody else  why would they  from the employee   s perspective  the environments these bosses created offered unique opportunities for excitement  innovation and advancement  it also offered the prestige of working at a top brand name employer in the industry another paradox was equally important  top performers keep delivering benefits when they stop working for you  great bosses get the most out of their talent flows by building networks of former employees  although these networks help alumni build their careers  bosses also rely on them for business opportunities  information  vendor relationships and new recruits  the very existence of these networks has value because it further cements the boss   s reputation as someone who can help foster a career  thus heightening the    talent magnet    effect  so  it   s no surprise that many of the bosses i studied helped their best people move on  as they intuitively understood  every star who left made the alumni network that much more powerful consider one health care star who left to found his own company  he told me that senior leaders at his company weren   t particularly upset or anxious about his decision     they were all excited for me  they had a party the day we closed the deal     that went for the top boss  too  he    was right there every step of the way  and he invested in the company  without his support and guidance  i never could have made this happen    the star turned entrepreneur became an important part of his former boss   s network  and as his business grew  the former boss   s equity share grew as well throughout his long career  in fact  that boss helped many prot  g  s start their own businesses  sometimes investing in them or providing advice  other times arranging to buy products and services from them  partly as a result  his company   s hometown is now the headquarters of hundreds of health care firms  with the boss having some influence over  or a direct role in  the majority of them as an alumnus of that company told me  the company   s network remains vibrant  built on strong personal connections     the social community around here  the arts  the various things that we do to support human services organizations here   we all show up at the same places  and we all associate with each other    the next time your top performer talks about leaving  what will you do  i suggest you follow the lead of the world   s greatest bosses and welcome it  our people are our greatest assets  but not in the way we usually think  to win big  we can no longer afford to keep our best talent to ourselves  we have to be willing to lose it  our talent will be better off  and so will we  dr  finkelstein is the  steven roth professor of management and director of the tuck center for leadership at dartmouth college  and the author of    superbosses  how exceptional leaders master the flow of talent     he can be reached at reports wsj com
